[00:00.000 --> 00:03.900]  Hey guys. Gavin's late. Crazy. Not yet.
[00:05.060 --> 00:09.100]  He has seconds. He's got, he's got 30 seconds. What? I think it says 11.
[00:09.800 --> 00:12.200]  Yeah, but it's within the minute.
[00:12.840 --> 00:16.200]  Didn't we have a whole run of this on the show? Hold on.
[00:16.820 --> 00:19.780]  Hold on. He's got 20 seconds. God, I didn't get a chance to test my recording.
[00:19.880 --> 00:21.660]  I hope it's going well. I don't want to stop it now.
[00:22.300 --> 00:24.160]  I don't know if I like new Geoff.
[00:25.220 --> 00:27.920]  Well, I'm not sure if I like it. I'm still working. 10 seconds.
[00:27.920 --> 00:32.160]  I think, I think I will like it, but I'm still, I'm adjusting.
[00:32.500 --> 00:34.140]  I don't know what that means.
[00:34.380 --> 00:37.800]  I'm the same old Geoff. He's here. It's on time. Damn it.
[00:38.320 --> 00:41.680]  Oh man, you really cut, you were cutting it close.
[00:43.140 --> 00:45.880]  Got to turn you up now. This is...
[00:45.880 --> 00:47.080]  Nothing to save yourself. You Geoffed the whole thing.
[00:48.240 --> 00:50.420]  You have to turn me up? I thought I was, I'm not loud enough.
[00:50.880 --> 00:53.240]  I was, I turned you down because you're too loud for me.
[00:53.380 --> 00:56.400]  And now I'm turning you... Hello? It's... Hey, Gavin.
[01:00.920 --> 01:01.880]  You okay?
[01:05.120 --> 01:07.160]  He's coming home today, man.
[01:09.220 --> 01:11.740]  What's so funny? You? You?
[01:11.900 --> 01:15.020]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:15.500 --> 01:18.020]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey,
[01:18.120 --> 01:20.740]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour. Episode 10.
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.560]  Gavin, you're hilarious.
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.360]  Discord's a piece of shit.
[01:23.900 --> 01:25.540]  Well, yeah.
[01:26.780 --> 01:29.200]  I walk away from my computer, right? I walk away.
[01:29.500 --> 01:31.320]  Everything is just left as it was.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.020]  Discord is minimized, right?
[01:34.380 --> 01:37.540]  And then when I click it on the taskbar, it won't...
[01:38.120 --> 01:41.080]  It won't get big again. What's the laugh about?
[01:43.940 --> 01:46.780]  Maybe it's thinking about Cecil Fielder or King Kong Bundy.
[01:47.960 --> 01:49.480]  That's what did it for me in high school.
[01:49.940 --> 01:51.640]  You and freaking King Kong Bundy.
[01:52.860 --> 01:55.100]  You try to maintain an erection thinking about him.
[01:58.540 --> 01:59.400]  How's it going, everyone?
[01:59.920 --> 02:00.480]  I'm good.
[02:00.820 --> 02:02.200]  Nick said whiskey discord.
[02:04.840 --> 02:05.680]  Oh, man.
[02:06.720 --> 02:08.140]  Whiskey discord is great.
[02:10.660 --> 02:12.320]  What do you think of new Geoff, Gavin?
[02:12.520 --> 02:13.700]  Because I'm thrown by it.
[02:14.040 --> 02:15.500]  Yeah, what do you think of new Geoff, Gavin?
[02:15.760 --> 02:16.460]  What's new about him?
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.340]  He sounds completely different. What are you talking about?
[02:19.800 --> 02:20.560]  Alright, say something, Geoff.
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.040]  Hey, what's up? It's your old pal Geoff sounding completely different,
[02:24.080 --> 02:25.100]  according to Andrew and Eric.
[02:25.100 --> 02:27.400]  He sounds like he's an AM radio host.
[02:27.940 --> 02:28.680]  Nah, he sounds fine.
[02:29.180 --> 02:31.500]  Nah, it's not that he sounds bad.
[02:31.720 --> 02:33.260]  I think it is, once again,
[02:33.320 --> 02:35.620]  this is like the widescreen of your voice
[02:35.620 --> 02:37.420]  where I'm just not used to it.
[02:37.740 --> 02:38.620]  Full spectrum voice?
[02:39.100 --> 02:40.360]  Yeah, it's a full spectrum Geoff.
[02:40.820 --> 02:41.380]  Oh, man.
[02:42.020 --> 02:45.160]  You're hearing all the notes that other people can't.
[02:46.120 --> 02:48.060]  Yeah, well, I replaced my Scarlett
[02:48.060 --> 02:49.360]  that we initially recorded,
[02:49.380 --> 02:52.140]  that I recorded the first 215 episodes
[02:52.140 --> 02:52.860]  of this thing with
[02:52.860 --> 02:54.760]  with a Rode Podcaster
[02:54.760 --> 02:57.180]  that immediately broke and I bought a second one
[02:57.180 --> 02:58.160]  but I got the first one fixed.
[02:58.440 --> 03:00.140]  And now I have two Rode Podcasters,
[03:00.240 --> 03:01.740]  one for my PC and one for my Mac.
[03:03.780 --> 03:05.080]  You sound too good,
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.060]  I think, is the problem.
[03:07.040 --> 03:09.540]  It feels like you're an actual host
[03:09.540 --> 03:10.420]  of the show.
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.060]  Would it help if I, like,
[03:12.520 --> 03:14.100]  I could...
[03:14.680 --> 03:15.240]  Hey, wait.
[03:18.020 --> 03:19.000]  That's old Geoff back.
[03:19.200 --> 03:19.960]  There we go.
[03:20.720 --> 03:21.380]  That's, yeah.
[03:21.620 --> 03:24.380]  I feel like I'm part of not a real production now.
[03:24.460 --> 03:26.020]  Thank you. I'm back to feeling good.
[03:28.480 --> 03:28.840]  Andrew.
[03:29.960 --> 03:30.320]  Gavin!
[03:31.300 --> 03:33.260]  We had a little week off, we had a little break.
[03:34.240 --> 03:35.780]  And you said last time...
[03:35.780 --> 03:36.720]  Oh, not really a break.
[03:38.040 --> 03:39.040]  You worked a lot.
[03:39.520 --> 03:41.480]  Yeah, we did a lot of recording. I just want to be clear.
[03:41.560 --> 03:43.280]  It's not like we took a break for a week.
[03:43.540 --> 03:45.480]  I took a break, y'all worked your asses off.
[03:45.980 --> 03:48.260]  Yeah, we kept working, but there was a break for this podcast
[03:48.260 --> 03:49.900]  during which, in between,
[03:50.200 --> 03:52.540]  you said you were going to work on your desk.
[03:52.920 --> 03:53.420]  How'd you get on?
[03:53.800 --> 03:56.060]  Wow, you really immediately thrown at me.
[03:56.620 --> 03:58.440]  Expecting me to have not done a thing,
[03:58.580 --> 04:00.300]  didn't you? You little sneaky
[04:00.300 --> 04:01.140]  Brit over there.
[04:01.340 --> 04:03.940]  Trying to have a lot of time
[04:03.940 --> 04:05.360]  to try to make fun of me.
[04:05.680 --> 04:07.360]  I'm using a new setup too, Gavin.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.220]  I'm using a new setup as well.
[04:09.420 --> 04:11.980]  Because I remembered my homework. I did my job.
[04:12.840 --> 04:13.520]  Let me, uh...
[04:13.520 --> 04:15.580]  I'm going to be honest, it's a little precarious.
[04:15.580 --> 04:17.320]  There might need to be some
[04:17.320 --> 04:18.080]  adjustments done.
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.320]  I went with a Geoff
[04:21.840 --> 04:22.320]  approach.
[04:22.880 --> 04:25.740]  With the setup. I would say, let me just open up
[04:25.740 --> 04:26.960]  this app on my phone.
[04:27.040 --> 04:29.620]  I took a little photo before we went live.
[04:29.780 --> 04:30.960]  I bet it is a little photo too.
[04:31.720 --> 04:32.260]  Yeah, it is.
[04:32.500 --> 04:34.940]  It's a half Bundy, I would say.
[04:36.520 --> 04:37.000]  Um...
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.500]  Let me, uh...
[04:39.500 --> 04:40.520]  Go to open this.
[04:40.760 --> 04:42.200]  I bought some clamps.
[04:43.360 --> 04:43.980]  Uh...
[04:43.980 --> 04:46.420]  In the style that Geoff was suggesting.
[04:47.400 --> 04:48.440]  And, uh...
[04:48.440 --> 04:49.560]  I clamped down
[04:50.190 --> 04:51.300]  a piece of wood
[04:52.070 --> 04:53.120]  onto my desk.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.420]  And then I put my mic clamp
[04:56.010 --> 04:56.840]  on that.
[05:00.200 --> 05:02.440]  So I didn't have to nail the desk.
[05:02.780 --> 05:03.600]  I didn't need a hammer.
[05:04.260 --> 05:06.020]  I bought some clamps.
[05:06.540 --> 05:08.390]  But I bought, um...
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.900]  Like, arts and crafts wood
[05:10.900 --> 05:12.820]  off of Amazon.
[05:13.100 --> 05:14.220]  That's the...
[05:14.220 --> 05:17.140]  So that's like ten little pieces of wood
[05:17.140 --> 05:19.320]  and one thing of...
[05:19.320 --> 05:20.880]  So it's not
[05:20.880 --> 05:22.980]  stable. It's really bent
[05:22.980 --> 05:24.500]  upwards. It's a curve.
[05:25.140 --> 05:26.960]  You've crushed a bunch of, like, thin
[05:26.960 --> 05:28.960]  chipboard together, and you've put your
[05:28.960 --> 05:30.700]  mic on top of the barcode part.
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.800]  Well, I mean, I didn't, yeah.
[05:33.300 --> 05:34.080]  No free ads.
[05:34.880 --> 05:35.200]  Um...
[05:35.200 --> 05:37.980]  They didn't want to scan and buy it themselves.
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.980]  But that's my
[05:39.980 --> 05:42.080]  setup. I now can get rid of my table
[05:42.080 --> 05:42.720]  mic stand.
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.900]  And maybe look into buying a thicker
[05:45.900 --> 05:48.120]  more singular piece of wood.
[05:48.780 --> 05:50.040]  But outside of that, it worked pretty
[05:50.040 --> 05:52.140]  good, I would say. I'd say it's a pretty good solution
[05:52.140 --> 05:53.200]  to the problem.
[05:53.880 --> 05:55.460]  I am impressed.
[05:56.240 --> 05:58.060]  And I'm glad it worked. I didn't have to nail
[05:58.060 --> 06:00.000]  anything. I didn't have to put a hole in
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.060]  my desk. I still don't have a
[06:02.060 --> 06:03.700]  drill. I don't need a drill, I don't think.
[06:04.480 --> 06:06.040]  Um... I just don't... I can't believe you
[06:06.040 --> 06:07.480]  don't want a drill for the rest of your life.
[06:07.940 --> 06:10.020]  I just don't. That's a bad combination.
[06:10.480 --> 06:11.840]  You know what they say, Gavin?
[06:12.100 --> 06:13.580]  More drills, more problems.
[06:14.020 --> 06:15.540]  That is what they say.
[06:15.940 --> 06:18.000]  I think there is a permanence
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.100]  to a hole that I do not need in my
[06:20.100 --> 06:22.060]  life. You don't want any holes permanent?
[06:22.540 --> 06:24.240]  No, because I would make a lot of
[06:24.240 --> 06:26.020]  unnecessary holes, I think. Or I
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.460]  would do poor holes.
[06:28.020 --> 06:29.960]  And then I would have to fix the hole.
[06:30.380 --> 06:31.960]  So I just am better not being
[06:31.960 --> 06:33.480]  in a position to generate holes.
[06:34.100 --> 06:34.460]  Okay.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.520]  I don't know if I ever
[06:37.520 --> 06:39.440]  told you guys this, but when I moved into my
[06:39.440 --> 06:40.800]  old house, the one that I no longer own,
[06:41.420 --> 06:43.460]  I hung a TV in my bedroom, not even thinking,
[06:43.580 --> 06:45.560]  just put up a flat screen TV. I resisted
[06:45.560 --> 06:47.140]  having a TV in the bedroom. Remember I had the
[06:47.140 --> 06:49.380]  ceiling TV for a long time. But eventually I
[06:49.380 --> 06:51.380]  decided I'd be a real big boy and I put a
[06:51.380 --> 06:53.460]  wall mount on my TV and hung it. And as
[06:53.460 --> 06:55.340]  I hung it and I drilled everything in, I realized
[06:55.340 --> 06:57.180]  I, on the other side, is my shower.
[06:57.260 --> 06:59.280]  And I missed my shower pipe
[06:59.280 --> 07:01.380]  by less than an inch.
[07:01.380 --> 07:02.720]  Oh my God.
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.600]  Less than an inch. And that's
[07:05.600 --> 07:07.040]  why drills,
[07:07.520 --> 07:09.400]  if you can go
[07:09.400 --> 07:11.240]  your whole life without a drill, Andrew, I
[07:11.240 --> 07:11.920]  recommend it.
[07:12.620 --> 07:15.480]  I was hanging a towel rail
[07:15.480 --> 07:16.380]  in my bathroom.
[07:17.220 --> 07:19.580]  And when I was done, I couldn't
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.160]  close the bathroom door.
[07:21.360 --> 07:23.120]  And it was one of those sliding pocket doors.
[07:23.420 --> 07:24.380]  And I'd
[07:25.180 --> 07:27.200]  attach the towel rail to
[07:27.200 --> 07:29.460]  the closed door inside
[07:29.460 --> 07:29.940]  the wall.
[07:30.900 --> 07:32.020]  Oh, man.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.700]  So now...
[07:35.700 --> 07:36.340]  That's great.
[07:37.040 --> 07:41.560]  Even though I replaced the screws
[07:41.560 --> 07:42.360]  with shorter ones.
[07:42.480 --> 07:45.280]  There are still two holes in my pocket door.
[07:45.540 --> 07:47.460]  Did you have like
[07:47.460 --> 07:49.460]  a solid ten seconds of feeling like a
[07:49.460 --> 07:51.360]  big man fixing the house?
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.140]  Doing your own install?
[07:53.740 --> 07:55.460]  And then, oh, there must have been
[07:55.460 --> 07:57.360]  so much pride in that moment between
[07:57.360 --> 07:59.600]  finishing and then going to close the door.
[07:59.900 --> 08:01.360]  Yeah, that was probably like
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.480]  a 20 minute period where I felt all big and strong
[08:03.480 --> 08:05.420]  badly until I couldn't pull
[08:05.420 --> 08:06.240]  the door out of the wall.
[08:06.940 --> 08:09.680]  When the door didn't pull, how long
[08:09.680 --> 08:11.740]  did it actually take for you
[08:12.260 --> 08:13.520]  to connect the dots?
[08:13.580 --> 08:15.280]  And how long did it feel like in your head?
[08:15.920 --> 08:17.380]  Oh, I connected the dots instantly
[08:17.380 --> 08:19.360]  when I tugged on the door from the
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.020]  little handle piece and
[08:21.020 --> 08:23.400]  it just bounced out of my hands. I just went,
[08:23.500 --> 08:25.440]  ugh. Do you think that was
[08:25.440 --> 08:27.500]  maybe one of the worst moments of your
[08:27.500 --> 08:29.400]  life in terms of just
[08:29.400 --> 08:31.040]  feeling good about yourself?
[08:33.340 --> 08:33.780]  Um...
[08:33.780 --> 08:34.980]  Bomb 20 for sure.
[08:35.800 --> 08:37.560]  Because I can't, I can't
[08:37.560 --> 08:39.460]  imagine the realization
[08:39.460 --> 08:41.480]  setting in on what I had done in that
[08:41.480 --> 08:41.800]  moment.
[08:43.140 --> 08:45.220]  I think, for me,
[08:45.440 --> 08:47.180]  my solution to that problem wouldn't be
[08:47.180 --> 08:49.400]  reapplying it, it would be figuring out a way to
[08:49.400 --> 08:51.280]  make it slide so your
[08:51.280 --> 08:53.360]  towel rack would just go in and out
[08:53.360 --> 08:55.280]  like cutting a channel so that
[08:55.280 --> 08:57.500]  every time I closed it...
[08:57.500 --> 08:58.860]  That would actually work better.
[08:59.060 --> 09:01.560]  Because those fricking...
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.300]  Those fiddly fricking little
[09:03.300 --> 09:05.520]  sliding pocket doors are a pain in the arse.
[09:05.680 --> 09:07.380]  If the entire door was run
[09:07.380 --> 09:09.440]  by me sliding my towel rail
[09:09.440 --> 09:11.000]  it would be much easier to use.
[09:11.580 --> 09:12.360]  I mean, I would just,
[09:12.920 --> 09:15.440]  imagining the face of someone who doesn't expect
[09:15.440 --> 09:17.120]  it walking into that bathroom
[09:17.120 --> 09:19.440]  closing the door behind them and seeing
[09:19.440 --> 09:21.040]  the towel rack just sliding.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.640]  Like the towels are just coming at you
[09:22.640 --> 09:23.460]  as you shut the door.
[09:25.800 --> 09:26.760]  Oh man.
[09:29.080 --> 09:31.120]  Andrew, earlier you said something about
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.760]  it feeling like not a real production.
[09:33.500 --> 09:34.820]  Speaking of not a real production,
[09:34.960 --> 09:36.860]  can I tell you guys about a TV show I watched
[09:36.860 --> 09:38.520]  the other night? Of course.
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.840]  Hulu has been begging
[09:40.840 --> 09:43.380]  me to watch the show
[09:43.380 --> 09:44.840]  the quiz with
[09:44.840 --> 09:47.040]  balls. Every time I load
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.000]  up Hulu, the quiz
[09:49.000 --> 09:49.980]  with balls
[09:50.980 --> 09:52.680]  they're ramming it down my face.
[09:52.800 --> 09:55.080]  It's a major network show. It's like ABC, NBC, CBS
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.660]  I don't know. And it's basically
[09:56.660 --> 09:59.040]  what you think it is, is exactly
[09:59.040 --> 09:59.680]  what it is.
[10:00.280 --> 10:02.640]  It's like two families
[10:02.640 --> 10:05.000]  compete in trivia. And then one family
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.920]  goes up and they stand in a
[10:06.920 --> 10:08.920]  slot over a swimming pool
[10:08.920 --> 10:10.800]  and then behind them
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.800]  on a ramp is a giant ball.
[10:13.100 --> 10:14.640]  And they answer a question
[10:14.640 --> 10:16.800]  and the one who gets it the most wrong
[10:16.800 --> 10:18.840]  gets shot into the water.
[10:19.380 --> 10:20.860]  Except this image isn't
[10:20.860 --> 10:22.660]  even doing it justice. The episode I watched
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.840]  they had a family all
[10:24.840 --> 10:26.800]  in denim jeans with big
[10:26.800 --> 10:28.000]  chunky tennis shoes
[10:29.160 --> 10:30.800]  and then all they do is
[10:30.800 --> 10:32.900]  get an answer wrong and they just drop
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.840]  them in water and then they have to swim all the
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.820]  way across this pool and then a guy in a security
[10:36.820 --> 10:38.780]  guard just gives them a towel and
[10:38.780 --> 10:40.540]  then they have to go sit on a vinyl sofa
[10:40.540 --> 10:42.480]  which must, if you're there,
[10:42.860 --> 10:44.400]  really stink after a while.
[10:44.400 --> 10:46.400]  And just be like
[10:46.400 --> 10:48.440]  a thousand wet farting sounds because they're
[10:48.440 --> 10:49.620]  just sliding all over vinyl.
[10:49.840 --> 10:52.720]  It was one of the dumbest
[10:52.720 --> 10:54.380]  things I've ever seen in my
[10:54.380 --> 10:56.180]  entire life and I can't
[10:56.180 --> 10:58.440]  fucking believe it got made.
[10:58.820 --> 10:59.540]  Like, I can't...
[10:59.540 --> 11:02.160]  They pitched it and somebody said,
[11:02.260 --> 11:04.220]  yeah, that's a good pitch.
[11:04.340 --> 11:06.220]  Yeah, and then they built a giant freaking
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.480]  swimming pool set that probably cost millions
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.660]  of dollars. Cost millions of dollars
[11:10.660 --> 11:11.980]  so somebody could say,
[11:11.980 --> 11:13.800]  name five cities in Ohio
[11:13.800 --> 11:16.100]  and then one person gets one wrong
[11:16.100 --> 11:17.800]  and then they just throw them in the water
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.960]  and make them swim in full clothes.
[11:20.340 --> 11:21.160]  Heavy ass denim.
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.260]  America has this real fascination
[11:24.260 --> 11:26.120]  with feeling like they need to
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.720]  make trivia more exciting.
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.260]  What was the Ellen DeGeneres show
[11:30.260 --> 11:32.060]  where like, if you got it wrong, you got
[11:32.060 --> 11:33.300]  ripped into the sky.
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.240]  They dropped you like 20 feet
[11:36.240 --> 11:37.700]  sometimes. That was insane.
[11:38.200 --> 11:40.200]  It was the game of games
[11:40.200 --> 11:42.080]  or something. I have no idea what that's called
[11:42.080 --> 11:44.040]  but there is a history
[11:44.040 --> 11:46.140]  of something stupid happening
[11:46.140 --> 11:47.440]  to you if you get it wrong.
[11:48.060 --> 11:50.260]  I feel like I could make a much cheaper show
[11:50.260 --> 11:52.000]  though. I could make the quiz
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.040]  with fists and everyone's just stood
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.940]  facing a hole in a wall and a
[11:55.940 --> 11:58.080]  freaking boxing glove just rocks them if they
[11:58.080 --> 12:00.280]  get it wrong. Or even just the quiz
[12:00.280 --> 12:00.960]  with push.
[12:01.980 --> 12:03.960]  And there's just five people standing behind you
[12:03.960 --> 12:04.780]  and one of them pushes you.
[12:06.840 --> 12:08.240]  It's just such a
[12:08.240 --> 12:10.200]  bad, lame premise. They're like, what's
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.100]  funny about Wipeout? People getting
[12:12.100 --> 12:14.260]  hit. Okay, what's funny about quiz shows?
[12:14.380 --> 12:16.200]  Nothing. Ah, slam it together.
[12:16.400 --> 12:17.200]  Everybody can swim, right?
[12:17.520 --> 12:20.480]  It was so fucking, just so bad.
[12:20.760 --> 12:21.820]  And I just can't believe
[12:21.820 --> 12:23.780]  Oh, it's on Fox. I'm sorry.
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.080]  It must cost, like, you know how much
[12:26.080 --> 12:27.800]  how many millions of dollars
[12:27.800 --> 12:30.080]  they invest in an episode of
[12:30.080 --> 12:31.640]  the quiz with balls?
[12:32.520 --> 12:34.240]  So that Jay Pharoah can do
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.100]  like a fucking Wesley Snipes impression three
[12:36.100 --> 12:37.900]  times or whatever because he's the host.
[12:38.140 --> 12:40.260]  Like, Jesus Christ. I had the trailer
[12:40.260 --> 12:42.100]  rammed down my throat on autoplay
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.120]  so many times. I just put an episode
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.020]  on and I fast forwarded until
[12:46.020 --> 12:47.860]  I could see someone get hit with a ball.
[12:48.240 --> 12:50.180]  It was like 13 minutes in before
[12:50.180 --> 12:51.940]  someone got balled.
[12:52.040 --> 12:54.220]  It's a bad ball ratio. There's only like
[12:54.220 --> 12:55.900]  eight questions in the whole show.
[12:57.800 --> 13:00.120]  I think what they need to do, let me try to punch up
[13:00.120 --> 13:02.420]  this show a little bit. You stand
[13:02.420 --> 13:04.200]  at the top and if you get
[13:04.200 --> 13:06.120]  it wrong, the boulder falls and you have to
[13:06.120 --> 13:08.160]  outrun the boulder. And each
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.680]  lane gets progressively
[13:10.680 --> 13:11.720]  more steep.
[13:12.260 --> 13:13.860]  And if you get hit by the boulder, you're dead.
[13:14.020 --> 13:15.680]  And you're never seen again on the show.
[13:18.500 --> 13:20.360]  That's a good idea. If you get Indiana Jones
[13:20.360 --> 13:22.300]  in, I like that. But as it stands
[13:22.300 --> 13:24.580]  right now, it is the lamest
[13:24.580 --> 13:26.080]  fucking premise for television.
[13:26.320 --> 13:27.600]  And you're just looking at it and you're thinking like,
[13:27.740 --> 13:30.280]  there's a studio executive somewhere who makes
[13:30.280 --> 13:32.260]  over a million dollars a year
[13:32.260 --> 13:34.140]  and his job is just to say
[13:34.140 --> 13:36.320]  yes to that. Or her. Their job is
[13:36.320 --> 13:38.340]  just to say yes to that. And go
[13:38.340 --> 13:40.340]  alright, that's a hit. Maybe if you
[13:40.340 --> 13:42.300]  were covered head to toe in gasoline and the
[13:42.300 --> 13:44.320]  ball was on fire, and you would just
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.360]  as you were falling become on fire before
[13:46.360 --> 13:48.340]  being extinguished, that's a show I would watch.
[13:48.760 --> 13:50.420]  Yeah. What if somebody
[13:50.420 --> 13:52.400]  else has to run for you? Like someone in your
[13:52.400 --> 13:54.240]  family? Like if you get it wrong,
[13:54.640 --> 13:56.440]  it then triggers for your family
[13:56.440 --> 13:58.040]  to have to outrun the ball of fire.
[13:58.720 --> 14:00.240]  Even more snakes. It's not even
[14:00.240 --> 14:02.280]  just you. I like that idea
[14:02.280 --> 14:04.300]  that the whole military idea of
[14:04.300 --> 14:06.200]  we don't punish you, we punish the people around you.
[14:06.960 --> 14:07.600]  Exactly. Yeah.
[14:08.220 --> 14:10.020]  And then once one of your family members gets
[14:10.020 --> 14:12.220]  knocked in, you get railed with soap in a
[14:12.220 --> 14:14.420]  sock. Yeah, and then at about 2am
[14:14.420 --> 14:16.320]  you get a blanket party and it's not
[14:16.320 --> 14:16.600]  fun.
[14:18.320 --> 14:19.940]  What was it? Was it remote control?
[14:20.140 --> 14:21.600]  Was that the MTV Colin Quinn
[14:22.160 --> 14:24.220]  old trivia show? Yeah. That had a
[14:24.220 --> 14:26.280]  great exit if you got it wrong from trivia.
[14:26.700 --> 14:28.000]  That might be my favorite.
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.860]  I don't remember. They all sat
[14:29.860 --> 14:32.000]  in like Lazy Boys and if they got it
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.280]  wrong, the wall ate them.
[14:33.800 --> 14:35.900]  Like the chairs went up and the wall absorbed
[14:35.900 --> 14:37.820]  them. Yeah, they did that
[14:37.820 --> 14:38.480]  on
[14:39.660 --> 14:41.340]  that reality show
[14:41.740 --> 14:43.580]  villain. Oh.
[14:44.140 --> 14:45.680]  Awesome. The one hosted by
[14:46.380 --> 14:47.760]  not Daniel Tosh, but the
[14:47.760 --> 14:48.600]  other Daniel Tosh.
[14:49.820 --> 14:50.940]  What's his name? Michael?
[14:51.440 --> 14:53.240]  No, the other Daniel Tosh.
[14:53.840 --> 14:54.140]  Uh.
[14:54.140 --> 14:54.820]  The
[14:56.620 --> 14:57.420]  Anthony Jezelnik.
[14:58.040 --> 14:58.440]  Okay.
[15:00.060 --> 15:02.100]  I never watched the villains one.
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.260]  I was really excited about that premise. It wasn't very good.
[15:04.320 --> 15:06.180]  I only watched like two episodes and it was pretty bad.
[15:06.180 --> 15:06.620]  Oh, that's too bad.
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.900]  There's some great clips from it, but
[15:09.900 --> 15:12.080]  maybe that's a clip share. I think they're doing
[15:12.080 --> 15:14.020]  a second season too, so it might be worth going
[15:14.020 --> 15:14.600]  back and finishing.
[15:15.800 --> 15:18.040]  Hey Gav, you know how like you used to
[15:18.040 --> 15:20.060]  when you would come to America, you would talk about
[15:20.060 --> 15:22.080]  how the shits in
[15:22.080 --> 15:24.080]  America were so much worse than the
[15:24.080 --> 15:26.180]  shits in England, and it was like instant, like as soon
[15:26.180 --> 15:27.920]  as you got into America, you just started
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.860]  your shits just became like ten times worse.
[15:30.160 --> 15:32.100]  It's so funny you mention that, because I've had a morning.
[15:32.900 --> 15:33.180]  Oh!
[15:35.060 --> 15:36.400]  You got the England shits?
[15:37.220 --> 15:38.280]  You got the coming home
[15:38.280 --> 15:39.880]  shits? Stress shits right now, yeah.
[15:39.920 --> 15:42.080]  I guess I had some bad Italian food last night and
[15:42.700 --> 15:43.740]  Oh, where'd you eat?
[15:44.180 --> 15:45.360]  I don't know.
[15:46.120 --> 15:48.240]  I didn't go out, it was order in and I didn't order in.
[15:48.340 --> 15:50.040]  Oh, okay. Well, I
[15:50.040 --> 15:51.840]  I'm sorry to hear about your morning.
[15:52.040 --> 15:54.100]  I hope it improves for you. I would take
[15:54.100 --> 15:56.160]  some Pepto Bismol if I were you.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.900]  I realized
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.820]  this last week in Michigan that Michigan
[15:59.820 --> 16:02.100]  is my America. It makes you
[16:02.100 --> 16:03.940]  shit? Oh my
[16:03.940 --> 16:05.700]  God, dude. The
[16:05.700 --> 16:07.180]  diarrhea, the
[16:08.040 --> 16:09.800]  the torment
[16:09.800 --> 16:11.980]  I put Emily's parents
[16:11.980 --> 16:13.120]  toilet through.
[16:15.760 --> 16:18.120]  I felt bad, man.
[16:18.120 --> 16:20.200]  I was doing like full scrubs
[16:20.200 --> 16:22.280]  every time I... I was like doing a full
[16:22.840 --> 16:23.980]  bathroom clean down
[16:23.980 --> 16:26.280]  because these are my in-laws. But I was having
[16:26.280 --> 16:26.840]  like
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.620]  I was having like you stole
[16:31.620 --> 16:33.940]  a bunch of marked bills in a bag
[16:33.940 --> 16:35.940]  from the bank and you
[16:35.940 --> 16:38.140]  finally get to your safe house and you open it up
[16:38.140 --> 16:39.460]  and you get hit with the pink spray.
[16:39.740 --> 16:42.080]  The dye pack. Yeah, that was
[16:42.080 --> 16:43.980]  me four times a day
[16:43.980 --> 16:45.420]  for the eight days I was there.
[16:46.920 --> 16:48.340]  And I realized
[16:49.040 --> 16:50.360]  there is nothing
[16:50.360 --> 16:52.740]  there's nothing that makes an airplane
[16:52.740 --> 16:54.400]  flight longer. Maybe
[16:54.400 --> 16:56.640]  shitting your pants seven times like the time you did it.
[16:56.640 --> 16:58.640]  But then just trying not to shit
[16:58.640 --> 17:00.740]  your pants. But also being like I can't
[17:00.740 --> 17:02.620]  go on the plane because
[17:02.620 --> 17:04.240]  there's not enough toilet paper
[17:04.240 --> 17:06.460]  and distance from other people
[17:06.460 --> 17:07.800]  to make this like
[17:08.680 --> 17:10.600]  survivable. So just like trying to
[17:10.600 --> 17:12.600]  hold in a diarrhea for two and a half hours
[17:12.600 --> 17:14.620]  on a plane is brutal. And I
[17:14.620 --> 17:15.960]  was so out of sorts
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.300]  that when I got up I had like
[17:18.300 --> 17:20.420]  Emily's bag behind me and
[17:20.420 --> 17:22.540]  my bag in front of me and she was moving on
[17:22.540 --> 17:24.040]  and you know everybody's like cramming to get
[17:24.040 --> 17:26.420]  out of there. And like Emily was like oh can you grab my
[17:26.420 --> 17:28.360]  purse? And I like spun around to
[17:28.360 --> 17:30.480]  grab her purse and somehow I flipped
[17:30.480 --> 17:32.380]  myself around, got both of
[17:32.380 --> 17:34.200]  my arms caught behind myself and I
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.540]  fell into a row of chairs face
[17:36.540 --> 17:38.640]  first. Landed on
[17:38.640 --> 17:40.180]  my you know like on the middle row
[17:40.180 --> 17:42.000]  the crossbar like the arm support
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.080]  landed chest onto that
[17:44.080 --> 17:46.040]  with my head over it and because my hand was
[17:46.040 --> 17:47.880]  like trapped under me and behind me I
[17:47.880 --> 17:50.140]  couldn't push myself off and my legs
[17:50.140 --> 17:51.960]  were wedged in between the suitcases and
[17:51.960 --> 17:53.940]  I just kind of had to lay there for like three
[17:53.940 --> 17:55.980]  seconds to try to figure out how to get out
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.940]  of there. While the people around me did
[17:57.940 --> 18:00.020]  that thing where they started laughing and then they
[18:00.020 --> 18:01.900]  stopped laughing because they
[18:02.400 --> 18:03.900]  suddenly wasn't funny because
[18:03.900 --> 18:05.400]  they didn't know if I was hurt or
[18:05.900 --> 18:07.960]  you know or if they needed to help me
[18:07.960 --> 18:09.880]  or not and I was clearly holding people back
[18:09.880 --> 18:11.980]  and the whole time just laying there
[18:11.980 --> 18:13.960]  trying to figure out how to get out of there and hold
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.280]  my diarrhea in.
[18:15.740 --> 18:17.860]  So you were like a turtle
[18:17.860 --> 18:19.820]  on it's back trying not to shit.
[18:20.300 --> 18:21.940]  I was like a turtle on it's back trying not
[18:21.940 --> 18:23.840]  to shit but I was a Geoff on my face
[18:23.840 --> 18:24.660]  trying not to shit.
[18:26.480 --> 18:27.920]  And Emily took off like
[18:27.920 --> 18:29.760]  she didn't see it so she was like
[18:29.760 --> 18:31.700]  I heard a commotion and by the time I caught up with her
[18:31.700 --> 18:33.360]  with like 80 bags
[18:33.880 --> 18:35.540]  holding my butthole together it was
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.740]  rough. But that row was empty right?
[18:37.740 --> 18:39.460]  Yeah thank god dude
[18:39.460 --> 18:40.480]  because I was going into it
[18:41.580 --> 18:42.060]  regardless.
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.640]  It's hard to push yourself off when you're trapped
[18:45.640 --> 18:47.620]  under your arms and your chest is like
[18:47.620 --> 18:49.340]  hanging over a ledge.
[18:49.860 --> 18:51.740]  Yeah and priority one is
[18:51.740 --> 18:52.740]  still not shitting.
[18:54.580 --> 18:55.620]  My non shitting
[18:55.620 --> 18:57.480]  flight from LA to Austin took
[18:57.480 --> 18:59.560]  what felt like 9 hours even though
[18:59.560 --> 19:01.800]  it was probably a 3 hour
[19:01.800 --> 19:03.860]  flight. Just locked in and not shitting?
[19:04.140 --> 19:04.980]  That's all you're thinking about?
[19:04.980 --> 19:06.460]  I just physically
[19:06.840 --> 19:09.220]  sat on my hands holding my anus closed
[19:09.220 --> 19:09.980]  and then
[19:10.860 --> 19:12.540]  losing grip on it when I fell asleep.
[19:13.040 --> 19:14.840]  I didn't use headphones because it was too
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.560]  much
[19:17.540 --> 19:18.900]  I just read
[19:18.900 --> 19:21.180]  reddit on my phone because the noise was too much
[19:21.180 --> 19:22.400]  for focusing.
[19:22.920 --> 19:25.080]  That was like that intense.
[19:27.680 --> 19:29.040]  Anyway so that was my week.
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.920]  Sounds like y'all had a lot of fun
[19:30.920 --> 19:31.780]  playing video games.
[19:31.780 --> 19:33.460]  We played a lot of video games.
[19:33.660 --> 19:35.280]  I've been watching soccer.
[19:35.640 --> 19:37.440]  I've become a little bit of a soccer fan.
[19:37.800 --> 19:39.460]  I feel like everyone's getting into it.
[19:39.800 --> 19:41.080]  I saw Canada play last night.
[19:41.740 --> 19:42.560]  Oh yeah.
[19:43.500 --> 19:45.520]  They scored a goal in this tournament
[19:45.520 --> 19:47.880]  so they were in Copa America and they scored a goal
[19:47.880 --> 19:49.820]  for the first time. That was very exciting.
[19:50.280 --> 19:51.520]  They made it to the semi finals
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.760]  which was very exciting. Played against Argentina.
[19:54.320 --> 19:55.640]  It looked really good for about
[19:55.640 --> 19:57.900]  5 minutes and then it never looked good again.
[19:58.180 --> 19:59.940]  That was it. But as
[19:59.940 --> 20:01.800]  as somebody who
[20:01.800 --> 20:03.780]  didn't like draws in soccer
[20:03.780 --> 20:05.900]  following a team that has low
[20:05.900 --> 20:08.120]  expectations, the possibility
[20:08.120 --> 20:09.940]  of a tie is so
[20:09.940 --> 20:11.840]  exciting. Because it's just like we
[20:11.840 --> 20:14.000]  just gotta prevent a goal. It's starting
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  in a position where we could technically kind
[20:16.000 --> 20:17.960]  of win. And it's great.
[20:18.520 --> 20:20.000]  And if you force a tie all the way to penalties
[20:20.000 --> 20:22.060]  that's well exciting. Anyone could win
[20:22.060 --> 20:24.200]  that. Exactly. It feels like
[20:24.200 --> 20:25.900]  penalties is like a complete
[20:25.900 --> 20:27.400]  coin flip. So
[20:28.080 --> 20:29.520]  even when there's not penalties
[20:29.520 --> 20:31.540]  just the ability of like okay we just have
[20:31.540 --> 20:33.360]  to do nothing. As long as nobody
[20:33.360 --> 20:35.520]  does anything, we can still
[20:35.520 --> 20:36.860]  have a favorable result.
[20:37.720 --> 20:39.460]  And I'm a fan. It's been a lot
[20:39.460 --> 20:41.680]  of fun to watch. I did, however
[20:42.240 --> 20:43.120]  didn't know
[20:43.120 --> 20:45.520]  that Copa America and
[20:45.520 --> 20:47.460]  the Euro are two different things.
[20:48.260 --> 20:49.520]  I learned that. Two different names
[20:49.520 --> 20:50.880]  didn't give that away?
[20:50.940 --> 20:53.460]  I thought maybe it was like a sub name
[20:53.460 --> 20:54.900]  like it was the Euro
[20:54.900 --> 20:56.560]  Copa America because
[20:56.560 --> 20:57.360]  it was in
[20:58.460 --> 21:00.580]  like it was in somewhere else.
[21:01.100 --> 21:02.560]  If that makes any sense.
[21:02.900 --> 21:04.800]  Because I've been waiting for the
[21:04.800 --> 21:06.820]  possibility of England and Canada to
[21:06.820 --> 21:08.680]  go up against each other. That's why I was
[21:08.680 --> 21:10.740]  passively watching before this
[21:10.740 --> 21:12.640]  point. I was like huh, England keeps winning,
[21:12.780 --> 21:14.800]  Canada keeps winning. This is going to be great. They're eventually
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.780]  going to get matched up. This is the way
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.860]  it's going. What you're thinking of
[21:18.860 --> 21:20.620]  is the World Cup.
[21:21.580 --> 21:22.860]  Yeah! That's what
[21:22.860 --> 21:24.580]  I thought both of those were.
[21:24.760 --> 21:26.860]  I thought I was watching the World Cup and we're
[21:26.860 --> 21:29.040]  all playing for the World Cup. That's in two years.
[21:29.800 --> 21:30.220]  Okay.
[21:30.800 --> 21:32.820]  But I mean if Canada qualify and England
[21:32.820 --> 21:34.940]  qualify, it could happen. But I've been following
[21:34.940 --> 21:36.680]  it and then Canada won to go to the
[21:36.680 --> 21:38.600]  semi-final and they're matched up against
[21:38.600 --> 21:40.760]  Argentina. I was like what the fuck?
[21:40.900 --> 21:43.080]  Where is England? And so I googled
[21:43.500 --> 21:44.780]  bracket for the Copa
[21:44.780 --> 21:46.800]  America tournament and didn't see
[21:46.800 --> 21:48.520]  England there but knew they were still active.
[21:48.740 --> 21:50.160]  And then I realized, oh no!
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.100]  This was never going to happen.
[21:52.460 --> 21:54.260]  I was never going to get my match up against Gavin.
[21:54.560 --> 21:56.300]  It was amazing that
[21:56.300 --> 21:58.340]  Canada was... who you said had just
[21:58.340 --> 22:00.220]  scored a goal in the tournament for the first time
[22:00.220 --> 22:02.100]  playing against the
[22:02.100 --> 22:03.880]  winners of the World Cup last year.
[22:04.540 --> 22:06.220]  What if we had a
[22:06.220 --> 22:07.940]  Copa Euro friendly
[22:07.940 --> 22:10.280]  where you guys play
[22:10.280 --> 22:11.500]  against each other in FIFA?
[22:11.940 --> 22:14.240]  That's what I've been saying. I've been trying to get that together.
[22:15.440 --> 22:16.260]  Are we playing
[22:16.260 --> 22:16.840]  or simming it?
[22:17.620 --> 22:19.140]  This is the first time I'm hearing it
[22:19.140 --> 22:20.320]  and it sounds like Gavin hasn't heard it either.
[22:20.620 --> 22:22.340]  I've been trying to get Gavin to do it for a week.
[22:22.440 --> 22:24.780]  I texted Gavin and Nick can back me up on this.
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.740]  I said, when are we doing it? And you said
[22:26.740 --> 22:28.260]  we're not doing it yet.
[22:29.160 --> 22:30.320]  I chased up on it, didn't I?
[22:30.980 --> 22:32.380]  Here, let's
[22:33.280 --> 22:34.160]  circle back on this.
[22:34.180 --> 22:36.740]  You just called him on that and he said, yeah, no,
[22:36.900 --> 22:38.100]  well, that's awesome.
[22:39.220 --> 22:40.480]  Shut the fuck up, Eric.
[22:40.480 --> 22:42.000]  You have nothing to do with this.
[22:43.480 --> 22:44.120]  Let me go.
[22:44.420 --> 22:46.320]  You fucking idiot, Eric. Let me go
[22:46.320 --> 22:47.480]  full Nick or whatever Nick said.
[22:49.360 --> 22:50.540]  I just repeated
[22:50.540 --> 22:52.320]  what you said, Andrew.
[22:52.400 --> 22:53.600]  Yeah, but you tried to make a point.
[22:54.420 --> 22:56.240]  We're going to get into a whole lot of garbage here.
[22:57.040 --> 22:57.760]  I texted.
[22:58.180 --> 23:00.060]  I was in a group text with you, Nick,
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.680]  and Gavin, trying to get this done.
[23:02.260 --> 23:03.880]  Gavin never replied, true or false?
[23:04.220 --> 23:06.480]  He did not reply. He never replied.
[23:06.600 --> 23:07.760]  He didn't acknowledge, didn't reply.
[23:07.760 --> 23:08.940]  He was on the schedule.
[23:10.520 --> 23:11.880]  I can't text you.
[23:11.980 --> 23:13.880]  I have no signal. I don't know what to do about it.
[23:14.060 --> 23:15.580]  I have to hold my...
[23:15.580 --> 23:17.560]  I have to go upstairs and hold my phone above my head
[23:17.560 --> 23:19.920]  because it doesn't use the internet. It uses fricking cellular.
[23:20.480 --> 23:21.240]  I can't...
[23:21.240 --> 23:22.280]  Fuck me, you idiot!
[23:24.420 --> 23:25.640]  We've been texting
[23:25.640 --> 23:27.160]  for years!
[23:27.460 --> 23:28.620]  For years!
[23:28.940 --> 23:31.280]  I walk away from my... I come back to my phone and
[23:31.280 --> 23:32.680]  something I sent an hour ago...
[23:32.680 --> 23:36.080]  I don't have as many fricking red exclamation
[23:36.080 --> 23:38.100]  marks as I do with anyone else
[23:38.100 --> 23:38.800]  as I do with you.
[23:39.360 --> 23:41.580]  Okay, that's fair. I'll slack you from now going forward.
[23:42.020 --> 23:43.680]  I just want to get a group text going.
[23:43.980 --> 23:45.120]  Nick replied, you didn't reply.
[23:46.040 --> 23:48.280]  Understandable that you weren't able to see it.
[23:48.740 --> 23:49.820]  I'm just saying I tried.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.060]  That's what I wanted to clear up.
[23:51.300 --> 23:53.760]  What makes you switch out of slack into texting?
[23:54.140 --> 23:56.340]  What's like... even though you're still talking about work.
[23:56.920 --> 23:58.120]  Yeah, I swapped
[23:58.120 --> 24:00.060]  to text because I didn't feel like making
[24:00.060 --> 24:02.020]  a group chat in slack.
[24:02.380 --> 24:03.600]  And also it was a weekend.
[24:03.600 --> 24:05.620]  So I wanted to reach you.
[24:06.280 --> 24:08.020]  I don't know how any of those
[24:08.020 --> 24:09.560]  qualify as... Can you settle
[24:09.560 --> 24:11.700]  something for me, Andrew? Do you have slack on your phone?
[24:12.300 --> 24:13.140]  Yeah, I do.
[24:13.580 --> 24:15.260]  Of course. Wait, why would I?
[24:16.560 --> 24:17.260]  What do you mean?
[24:18.440 --> 24:19.920]  So... It's on the Umidigi?
[24:20.460 --> 24:21.700]  We need to... It's on the
[24:21.700 --> 24:23.720]  Bison, yeah. We need to talk about
[24:23.720 --> 24:25.120]  what happened in the general chat.
[24:25.620 --> 24:26.600]  What the fuck?
[24:27.860 --> 24:29.540]  In the general chat? Oh, the
[24:29.540 --> 24:29.940]  messages?
[24:30.720 --> 24:32.420]  Let me put a screenshot in.
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.600]  That's great.
[24:35.640 --> 24:36.200]  Screenshot
[24:36.200 --> 24:37.260]  going in.
[24:40.320 --> 24:40.880]  Yeah.
[24:42.120 --> 24:43.060]  Yeah, you got it.
[24:43.540 --> 24:45.300]  There were a bunch of messages.
[24:45.620 --> 24:47.980]  My mom was over. I decided to do some
[24:47.980 --> 24:49.440]  cleaning that I wasn't aware of.
[24:50.000 --> 24:50.560]  And...
[24:51.660 --> 24:53.820]  I wasn't paying attention to my phone.
[24:53.920 --> 24:55.180]  And then like an hour later I looked.
[24:55.680 --> 24:57.480]  And Eric thought I got hacked.
[24:58.820 --> 24:59.260]  Because
[25:00.360 --> 25:01.540]  my mom decided
[25:01.540 --> 25:03.340]  to clean my desk area,
[25:03.340 --> 25:05.500]  which included wiping down my keyboard.
[25:06.240 --> 25:07.700]  I love that she...
[25:07.700 --> 25:09.380]  I love that you can see where she
[25:09.380 --> 25:11.520]  started. She did the number row, and then
[25:11.520 --> 25:13.560]  she did qwerty, and she was doing it
[25:13.560 --> 25:15.700]  row by row. And then she starts
[25:15.700 --> 25:17.720]  again. She gave it all a second
[25:17.720 --> 25:18.260]  pass.
[25:19.420 --> 25:21.580]  Well, that's a really good point. I was very confused.
[25:21.660 --> 25:23.520]  I was very worried when I saw, were you
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.460]  hacked? Because that was all the
[25:25.460 --> 25:27.440]  only context I had for what had
[25:27.440 --> 25:28.940]  happened. And then
[25:29.660 --> 25:31.600]  I figured it out. But my point is
[25:31.600 --> 25:33.180]  that we were all slacking in there,
[25:33.580 --> 25:35.540]  talking, like asking you if you're alright,
[25:35.720 --> 25:37.300]  what's going on. At one point I thought you were
[25:37.300 --> 25:39.360]  falling down the longest flight of stairs in the world.
[25:39.820 --> 25:41.460]  And then, you text
[25:41.460 --> 25:43.520]  us saying where, we let you
[25:43.520 --> 25:45.280]  know what was happening. And you text us saying
[25:45.280 --> 25:47.500]  where am I typing that. So you were on your
[25:47.500 --> 25:49.420]  phone, I guess ignoring all the
[25:49.420 --> 25:51.080]  slack, but replying to all the text.
[25:51.300 --> 25:53.560]  I didn't have the alerts. I didn't have slack alerts
[25:53.560 --> 25:55.080]  for that. I don't know.
[25:55.860 --> 25:57.800]  I don't know what to tell you. I didn't see it.
[25:58.540 --> 25:59.620]  If I would have had the
[25:59.620 --> 26:01.780]  alerts, I would have known where I was typing.
[26:02.300 --> 26:03.640]  I didn't just ignore
[26:03.640 --> 26:05.500]  the alerts. I'm saying, I didn't have a,
[26:05.700 --> 26:07.680]  there was no notification for any of your messages.
[26:07.960 --> 26:09.200]  The only thing I had
[26:09.200 --> 26:11.680]  was Eric saying, were
[26:11.680 --> 26:13.520]  you hacked? And maybe
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.540]  it was there, Gavin, but if you
[26:15.540 --> 26:17.640]  have a text that says, Andrew, were you
[26:17.640 --> 26:19.880]  hacked? Everything else becomes
[26:19.880 --> 26:21.000]  less of a priority.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.220]  You're immediately going there
[26:23.220 --> 26:25.240]  for more info. I'm not
[26:25.240 --> 26:27.000]  being like, oh, Eric thinks I'm hacked,
[26:27.120 --> 26:29.040]  whatever, let me see what else is going on.
[26:29.320 --> 26:30.960]  Let's browse a little bit.
[26:31.420 --> 26:32.400]  I immediately
[26:33.860 --> 26:35.000]  responded to the
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.320]  source of my hacking.
[26:37.860 --> 26:39.140]  Isn't it weird
[26:39.140 --> 26:41.160]  that you don't have alerts on for our slack
[26:41.160 --> 26:43.280]  though? No, I do have alerts. I think
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.120]  as I was talking through that, I think that
[26:45.120 --> 26:46.960]  realistically is more what
[26:46.960 --> 26:49.240]  happened where I saw, were
[26:49.240 --> 26:51.200]  you hacked? And immediately just followed
[26:51.200 --> 26:53.500]  that thread in a panic as opposed
[26:53.500 --> 26:55.220]  to just
[26:55.220 --> 26:57.020]  looking, because I didn't know. So you do
[26:57.020 --> 26:58.900]  or you don't have alerts?
[26:59.140 --> 27:00.280]  Of course I have alerts.
[27:00.820 --> 27:03.300]  The only time I don't get alerts is when
[27:03.300 --> 27:05.300]  You can't say of course at any time.
[27:05.840 --> 27:07.200]  Didn't he just say that
[27:07.200 --> 27:09.360]  he didn't have alerts? I feel crazy.
[27:09.980 --> 27:11.260]  Not I didn't have
[27:11.260 --> 27:13.260]  alerts in a permanent sense, I thought I didn't
[27:13.260 --> 27:15.040]  have alerts on my phone, like the UmiDigi
[27:15.040 --> 27:17.120]  maybe didn't push those alerts
[27:17.120 --> 27:18.960]  to it, but it probably did.
[27:19.420 --> 27:21.160]  I just wasn't aware of that because I
[27:21.160 --> 27:23.180]  saw, were you hacked? And immediately
[27:23.180 --> 27:25.080]  went into panic mode to try to figure
[27:25.080 --> 27:26.420]  out what you were talking about.
[27:27.220 --> 27:28.740]  Well, either way, it's good to know that you have
[27:29.900 --> 27:30.700]  slack open
[27:30.700 --> 27:33.020]  on an unlocked computer without a screen
[27:33.020 --> 27:35.160]  saver. Well, it's just, it's on
[27:35.160 --> 27:36.780]  my, it's, yeah, it's my computer.
[27:37.200 --> 27:39.260]  Are you afraid people are gonna find
[27:39.260 --> 27:40.840]  out of all of our secrets?
[27:42.920 --> 27:43.320]  Inofficial
[27:43.320 --> 27:45.320]  farts and cool images?
[27:45.980 --> 27:47.220]  Some of those farts are just
[27:47.220 --> 27:47.660]  for us.
[27:49.760 --> 27:50.660]  Let me circle,
[27:50.820 --> 27:53.060]  I got some, I got some beef with Gavin
[27:53.060 --> 27:55.460]  in this slack situation. We got some slack issues.
[27:55.920 --> 27:57.320]  You're riled me, I'm riled
[27:57.320 --> 27:59.040]  up now about this. I was riled up yesterday.
[27:59.180 --> 28:01.280]  I took strays. I don't think I've ever been
[28:01.280 --> 28:03.140]  more right about anything. We have a
[28:03.140 --> 28:05.420]  Monday meeting. We get together
[28:05.420 --> 28:07.160]  once a week on
[28:07.160 --> 28:09.220]  Monday and it is at
[28:09.220 --> 28:11.480]  what time is it? 8.30am?
[28:12.060 --> 28:12.780]  10.30 for us?
[28:12.780 --> 28:14.720]  10.30 for you.
[28:15.240 --> 28:16.900]  Okay? First week
[28:16.900 --> 28:18.720]  and I'm just, I'm vocalizing
[28:18.720 --> 28:20.780]  this, just, I'm not saying this is anyone's fault
[28:20.780 --> 28:22.920]  but mine. First week, couldn't
[28:22.920 --> 28:24.480]  sleep. Mind was racing.
[28:25.020 --> 28:26.760]  I decided that I would be better
[28:26.760 --> 28:28.760]  off, like, cause I tried. I put
[28:28.760 --> 28:30.900]  in, I just laid in bed, I closed my eyes for hours.
[28:31.260 --> 28:32.700]  Nothing was happening. I
[28:32.700 --> 28:34.720]  decided, hey, I'm just gonna stay
[28:34.720 --> 28:36.740]  up the rest of the night, knock
[28:36.740 --> 28:38.840]  out this meeting and then I'll be so tired, I'll have
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.800]  to sleep. If I get a few hours, then I can
[28:40.800 --> 28:42.720]  go about my day. So wait, what time is it when you
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.840]  decide this? Probably 5am.
[28:45.180 --> 28:46.700]  5.30am, I'd say.
[28:46.760 --> 28:48.940]  And I'd been trying to sleep from like 1 to 4
[28:48.940 --> 28:50.880]  at that point. And I
[28:50.880 --> 28:52.020]  had given up by 5.
[28:53.720 --> 28:54.880]  Give up by 5.
[28:55.840 --> 28:56.240]  7am.
[28:56.760 --> 28:59.060]  Hour before the meeting. Eric posts
[28:59.860 --> 29:00.820]  I think it was Eric.
[29:01.060 --> 29:02.780]  I don't remember. I shouldn't call it Eric cause I
[29:02.780 --> 29:04.500]  don't remember the specifics. Somebody said
[29:05.200 --> 29:06.620]  let's reschedule. No, it was you, Gavin.
[29:06.980 --> 29:08.620]  You said, let's reschedule the meeting.
[29:08.620 --> 29:10.600]  I have a thing on at that time.
[29:10.880 --> 29:12.460]  And it was a thing that existed
[29:12.460 --> 29:14.600]  prior to that. And I went, ah, I'm
[29:14.600 --> 29:16.740]  fucked. I stayed up all night. I didn't
[29:16.740 --> 29:18.920]  blame you for that. It was more just like
[29:18.920 --> 29:20.140]  odds and annoyance.
[29:20.780 --> 29:22.560]  That also is information you knew.
[29:22.700 --> 29:24.440]  We could've, if that was just
[29:24.440 --> 29:26.160]  vocalized a day prior,
[29:26.740 --> 29:28.440]  we could've just completely avoided this.
[29:28.960 --> 29:29.680]  Week two,
[29:30.240 --> 29:32.540]  I don't remember what happens with this meeting, but
[29:32.540 --> 29:34.440]  something happens and we don't have it at the
[29:34.440 --> 29:35.660]  time. It has to be moved.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.220]  Week three,
[29:38.020 --> 29:40.060]  there's another rescheduling
[29:40.060 --> 29:41.780]  that is an hour
[29:41.780 --> 29:44.100]  before the meeting starts.
[29:44.360 --> 29:45.940]  But the problem is
[29:45.940 --> 29:47.940]  I don't have an alarm set until
[29:47.940 --> 29:49.780]  eight cause my partner works nights.
[29:50.340 --> 29:51.760]  And I have my setup
[29:51.760 --> 29:53.900]  in our bedroom. So I
[29:53.900 --> 29:55.940]  have to, we both have to be up.
[29:56.060 --> 29:57.820]  Or I will wake them up just naturally.
[29:59.100 --> 30:00.000]  And so I
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.940]  said, let's, can we move
[30:01.940 --> 30:04.220]  the meeting an hour? Because
[30:04.880 --> 30:06.280]  we're giving, you're
[30:06.280 --> 30:08.200]  giving updates on the meeting is moved
[30:08.200 --> 30:09.860]  but it's pointless to me.
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.040]  Cause I don't wake up until an hour later.
[30:12.180 --> 30:13.920]  So now I'm just waking up
[30:13.920 --> 30:16.280]  to see that a meeting that never had a
[30:16.280 --> 30:18.400]  chance of happening is not happening.
[30:20.640 --> 30:22.460]  How am I in the wrong on this?
[30:22.620 --> 30:24.240]  I haven't gotten shit on for this
[30:24.240 --> 30:26.080]  for like four days.
[30:26.800 --> 30:27.320]  Well,
[30:27.920 --> 30:29.120]  it's the daytime.
[30:30.220 --> 30:32.140]  It's 8am here
[30:32.140 --> 30:34.040]  and my partner works
[30:34.040 --> 30:34.680]  nights.
[30:35.400 --> 30:37.780]  So that means
[30:37.780 --> 30:39.700]  that they go to bed late
[30:39.700 --> 30:42.040]  and then they sleep ideally
[30:42.040 --> 30:44.260]  through the first half of the day.
[30:44.440 --> 30:46.340]  Technically, they probably go to bed early
[30:46.340 --> 30:47.000]  I would think.
[30:47.640 --> 30:48.140]  Sure.
[30:48.860 --> 30:51.580]  So you're saying it should be later?
[30:51.800 --> 30:52.580]  Or we shouldn't move it?
[30:52.960 --> 30:56.260]  I'm saying that I wanted it moved
[30:56.260 --> 30:58.100]  an hour because you
[30:58.100 --> 31:00.100]  don't give updates on your
[31:00.100 --> 31:01.900]  schedule until an hour
[31:01.900 --> 31:04.180]  before it happens. At which point
[31:04.180 --> 31:05.540]  it's irrelevant to me
[31:05.540 --> 31:08.160]  because I'm sleeping and I'm gonna wake up
[31:08.160 --> 31:10.100]  in an hour to see that I didn't need to
[31:10.100 --> 31:11.980]  wake up at all. That was my point.
[31:12.240 --> 31:14.000]  But you do have to wake up anyway
[31:14.000 --> 31:16.020]  that day. I do, but
[31:16.020 --> 31:18.120]  not at that time. I'm waking up
[31:18.120 --> 31:19.860]  earlier than I normally would
[31:19.860 --> 31:21.440]  to make this meeting
[31:22.080 --> 31:23.940]  and by the time I see the alert
[31:23.940 --> 31:25.840]  it's pointless because
[31:25.840 --> 31:27.920]  I can't in my sleep
[31:27.920 --> 31:28.980]  register that you
[31:30.020 --> 31:32.040]  can't do it and that we have to
[31:32.040 --> 31:34.020]  move it. So an hour I
[31:34.020 --> 31:35.840]  can do. So now you've permanently
[31:35.840 --> 31:37.740]  moved it to 11.30 our time.
[31:37.840 --> 31:39.820]  Yes, exactly. And I'm happy.
[31:39.960 --> 31:41.620]  And that way if we change it
[31:42.400 --> 31:43.500]  like an hour before
[31:43.500 --> 31:45.740]  you'll already be up. I will be up.
[31:46.100 --> 31:47.700]  It will not have impacted
[31:47.700 --> 31:50.020]  the schedule in a way that it currently
[31:50.020 --> 31:51.680]  does. What if you oversleep?
[31:52.960 --> 31:53.820]  I have an alarm.
[31:53.920 --> 31:55.340]  Great question, Geoff. Andrew?
[31:55.340 --> 31:57.340]  I have several alarms.
[31:57.480 --> 31:59.360]  I've only one time almost
[31:59.360 --> 32:01.360]  slept through an alarm. Do you not think
[32:01.360 --> 32:03.520]  it's better to have a meeting earlier
[32:03.520 --> 32:05.400]  so it's not in the middle of the day for
[32:05.400 --> 32:07.060]  four fifths of us?
[32:08.240 --> 32:09.000]  So I
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.280]  am getting penalized for living on the
[32:11.280 --> 32:13.020]  west coast? Yeah, so he should suffer?
[32:15.980 --> 32:17.100]  All I do
[32:17.100 --> 32:19.040]  this is very American of you, Gavin.
[32:19.240 --> 32:20.440]  I'm a justice for everything.
[32:20.680 --> 32:23.440]  You guys, 10am show up, 8am
[32:23.440 --> 32:25.200]  for me. Every time.
[32:25.520 --> 32:26.920]  I'm gonna jump out
[32:26.920 --> 32:29.460]  in defense of Andrew here and just say
[32:29.460 --> 32:31.180]  that I do think he's pretty accommodating
[32:31.180 --> 32:33.480]  considering most of what we do
[32:33.480 --> 32:34.980]  is probably inconvenient for him.
[32:35.360 --> 32:36.720]  I do agree. I'm actually on your side.
[32:36.980 --> 32:39.380]  I often don't look at my
[32:39.380 --> 32:41.400]  calendar until Monday, which is my
[32:41.400 --> 32:43.400]  fault. I think what happened the time
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.520]  I did it, I had a doctor appointment
[32:45.520 --> 32:47.340]  at the time of our meeting that was probably
[32:47.340 --> 32:49.100]  booked like three months earlier.
[32:49.360 --> 32:51.440]  So I just was like, oh shit,
[32:51.440 --> 32:53.320]  that's this week. And I was like, sorry,
[32:53.400 --> 32:55.180]  I have to move it. Yeah, totally.
[32:55.260 --> 32:57.400]  And that's fine. But it was just like
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.460]  I agreed to this meeting to try
[32:59.460 --> 33:01.400]  to be accommodating to y'all, and then the meeting kept getting
[33:01.400 --> 33:03.400]  moved. And it was like, why are we doing
[33:03.400 --> 33:05.000]  this? Let's move this meeting.
[33:05.900 --> 33:07.380]  Yeah, you should have just said that
[33:07.380 --> 33:09.420]  in the beginning. That's all I was
[33:09.420 --> 33:11.400]  gonna say. I was just waiting for you guys to
[33:11.400 --> 33:13.340]  finish so I could say, why didn't you say any of this when
[33:13.340 --> 33:15.520]  we picked the first time? Yeah, if you have to
[33:15.520 --> 33:17.360]  wake up much earlier on
[33:17.360 --> 33:19.380]  one day, you should have been like, I'm not up
[33:19.380 --> 33:21.400]  by that. Yeah, just go like, hey, honestly, can we
[33:21.400 --> 33:23.380]  do it at one your time? That would put me in a good
[33:23.380 --> 33:25.120]  position. I don't care.
[33:25.820 --> 33:27.360]  Yeah, at the time, I think
[33:27.360 --> 33:29.320]  I agreed to it because it seemed
[33:29.320 --> 33:31.360]  like that's when the meeting was wanted
[33:31.360 --> 33:33.100]  to have taken place.
[33:33.260 --> 33:35.260]  I said that horribly. But there was
[33:35.260 --> 33:36.360]  a sense
[33:37.660 --> 33:39.520]  that that is when y'all wanted
[33:39.520 --> 33:41.500]  the meeting. And I was like, I'll
[33:41.500 --> 33:43.640]  do this for one week and see how it goes.
[33:43.740 --> 33:45.420]  And then if it's not ideal, then
[33:45.420 --> 33:47.400]  I'll move it. But then the meeting just kept
[33:47.400 --> 33:49.200]  getting moved and then it became
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.600]  just an annoyance of
[33:51.160 --> 33:53.500]  this is ridiculous. Why is this here?
[33:53.580 --> 33:55.440]  Turns out it wasn't convenient for any of us.
[33:55.700 --> 33:57.400]  None of us wanted this time
[33:57.400 --> 33:59.260]  in reality. And
[34:00.360 --> 34:01.400]  I tried
[34:01.400 --> 34:03.400]  to vocalize this point and I did it
[34:03.400 --> 34:05.300]  horribly because I was up the entire night
[34:05.300 --> 34:07.320]  last time we had the meeting because I almost
[34:07.320 --> 34:09.420]  missed the last meeting and
[34:10.720 --> 34:11.360]  I've been
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.420]  taking strays. I've been taking strays
[34:13.420 --> 34:14.520]  since that thing.
[34:14.520 --> 34:16.600]  And it is the most
[34:16.600 --> 34:18.800]  right I think I've ever been about anything.
[34:18.980 --> 34:20.420]  And I'm like, I can't. No.
[34:20.660 --> 34:22.360]  I will get shit on for so many things.
[34:22.660 --> 34:24.680]  I am in the right here. I know this isn't
[34:24.680 --> 34:26.540]  crazy. I'll give you that. But my
[34:26.540 --> 34:28.520]  thinking is, why would you decide
[34:28.520 --> 34:30.440]  at five that you're not going to go to sleep? Like,
[34:30.480 --> 34:32.620]  surely, even if you slept between seven
[34:32.620 --> 34:34.160]  and eight, sleep is sleep.
[34:35.520 --> 34:36.700]  Totally. Absolutely valid.
[34:36.820 --> 34:38.600]  There is a time period, and I've crossed that
[34:38.600 --> 34:40.540]  line where I was younger where I'd be like,
[34:40.600 --> 34:42.620]  ah, it'd be worse to get sleep. Like, I'll be more
[34:42.620 --> 34:44.660]  tired. And now I'm, no, if I get
[34:44.660 --> 34:46.720]  any sleep at all, that's a win. I just
[34:46.720 --> 34:48.300]  was incapable of it that night.
[34:48.580 --> 34:50.280]  I could not shut my brain off.
[34:50.700 --> 34:51.760]  I was fully awake.
[34:52.600 --> 34:53.920]  You were really excited for this meeting.
[34:54.340 --> 34:56.560]  I was so pumped to hear what was
[34:56.560 --> 34:57.980]  going to happen at this meeting.
[34:58.220 --> 34:59.080]  The set of schedule.
[35:01.440 --> 35:02.440]  And that has been
[35:02.440 --> 35:03.980]  that. But now the meeting's moved,
[35:04.360 --> 35:06.520]  and we'll see how it goes. We have
[35:06.520 --> 35:08.440]  a clean meeting next week.
[35:10.020 --> 35:10.500]  Hey,
[35:10.500 --> 35:12.380]  speaking of meetings, this is kind of
[35:12.380 --> 35:14.360]  an aside, but Eric,
[35:14.460 --> 35:16.160]  you and I had a meeting with a mutual
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.340]  friend yesterday that I've been thinking
[35:18.340 --> 35:20.320]  about since our meeting. I want to see what you guys think
[35:20.320 --> 35:22.320]  about this. I don't want to out the friend
[35:22.320 --> 35:23.940]  because I'm not sure if they'd be comfortable
[35:24.340 --> 35:26.240]  with the world knowing that
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.100]  they're friends with Eric and I.
[35:28.080 --> 35:29.940]  I can get how that would be a detractor.
[35:30.300 --> 35:32.100]  But we were hanging out with this friend
[35:32.100 --> 35:33.020]  who has
[35:33.020 --> 35:36.420]  a cool project that they work on. It's like their job.
[35:36.700 --> 35:38.360]  And we were talking about scheduling
[35:38.360 --> 35:40.060]  another meetup. And we were like,
[35:41.200 --> 35:42.240]  in the process,
[35:43.140 --> 35:43.640]  we were like,
[35:43.680 --> 35:46.380]  how are you handling your workload with the stuff that you're
[35:46.380 --> 35:48.460]  doing? And they said, well, I do it all
[35:48.460 --> 35:50.420]  on Mondays. I just get the whole thing done on Mondays.
[35:50.520 --> 35:52.260]  I bust my ass on Mondays and basically
[35:52.260 --> 35:54.160]  just get all of my work done on that day.
[35:54.640 --> 35:56.280]  And I was like, oh, that's pretty smart
[35:56.280 --> 35:58.300]  if you can do it. And they only have one project they're
[35:58.300 --> 35:59.960]  really working on right now. So I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
[36:00.260 --> 36:02.460]  And then we were trying to figure out when to get together again.
[36:02.520 --> 36:03.980]  And Eric said, well, what about next Friday?
[36:04.180 --> 36:06.240]  And they said, I tend to try... I don't
[36:06.240 --> 36:08.240]  want to schedule stuff on Fridays because I want to
[36:08.240 --> 36:10.380]  start my weekend early. And we were like, oh,
[36:10.540 --> 36:11.700]  okay, I guess that makes sense.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.320]  But then I was thinking about it in bed last night and I was like, doesn't
[36:14.320 --> 36:15.520]  your weekend start on Tuesday?
[36:16.700 --> 36:18.220]  You only work one day a week.
[36:18.420 --> 36:20.300]  Yeah, if you've slotted everything to be
[36:20.300 --> 36:22.100]  one day. I think you're
[36:23.240 --> 36:24.260]  oversimplifying what they were
[36:24.260 --> 36:26.340]  saying, but I will say
[36:26.340 --> 36:28.180]  I agree with you. What the fuck
[36:28.180 --> 36:30.100]  are they thinking, baby? I think
[36:30.740 --> 36:32.220]  at the end of this story, I know who that
[36:32.220 --> 36:32.580]  is now.
[36:32.580 --> 36:34.900]  I can't
[36:34.900 --> 36:36.980]  start my weekend early. You do!
[36:37.240 --> 36:38.120]  You work one day a week!
[36:39.600 --> 36:40.640]  It is
[36:40.640 --> 36:42.740]  an insane thing to say
[36:42.740 --> 36:44.640]  in the context, and I'm sure the way that
[36:44.640 --> 36:46.420]  I felt taking
[36:46.420 --> 36:48.720]  unnecessary strays for what I said,
[36:49.080 --> 36:50.800]  if this person is probably irate
[36:50.800 --> 36:52.660]  if they hear this, being like this is
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.440]  completely mischaracterized.
[36:54.960 --> 36:56.660]  But based on what you said,
[36:57.280 --> 36:58.300]  yeah, that's ridiculous.
[36:58.600 --> 37:00.580]  Oh, Eric's right.
[37:00.580 --> 37:02.620]  I'm sure I'm oversimplifying it a little bit,
[37:02.680 --> 37:04.620]  but the nuts and bolts of it are essentially correct.
[37:04.620 --> 37:05.100]  What I've said.
[37:06.840 --> 37:07.560]  So anyway,
[37:08.120 --> 37:10.220]  when do we want to get together again?
[37:10.680 --> 37:12.600]  I can't do Monday. Okay, how about Friday?
[37:12.860 --> 37:14.120]  Nah, I can't do Friday.
[37:14.360 --> 37:15.060]  Alright, cool.
[37:17.460 --> 37:18.720]  So, what do you want?
[37:19.380 --> 37:20.660]  Just say I don't want
[37:20.660 --> 37:21.720]  to get together again.
[37:23.540 --> 37:24.620]  Is it a friendly
[37:24.620 --> 37:25.640]  hangout, or is it work?
[37:26.480 --> 37:28.580]  No, it's friendly. It's kind of like what we
[37:28.580 --> 37:29.500]  do with Nick and Jason.
[37:30.100 --> 37:32.300]  Right, but that wouldn't mean...
[37:32.300 --> 37:34.280]  that wouldn't overtake the weekend.
[37:34.700 --> 37:36.000]  Even if your weekend had started,
[37:36.420 --> 37:38.720]  and it's a friendly hangout, then that's still the weekend.
[37:39.040 --> 37:39.820]  I think we agree.
[37:39.860 --> 37:41.260]  I think we agree with you, Gavin.
[37:41.500 --> 37:44.600]  I think we're five guys in a Discord call
[37:44.600 --> 37:45.600]  agreeing with each other.
[37:45.760 --> 37:48.720]  I think it sounds like three people where two of them are hanging out
[37:48.720 --> 37:49.960]  and one of them's at work.
[37:50.320 --> 37:52.480]  Okay, now that sounds
[37:52.480 --> 37:54.360]  like an accurate assessment
[37:54.360 --> 37:56.600]  of exactly what this relationship
[37:56.600 --> 37:58.400]  is to a T.
[38:06.100 --> 38:08.700]  You have no idea how right you are.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.180]  Man, you just
[38:10.180 --> 38:12.400]  hit the nail on the fucking
[38:12.400 --> 38:12.960]  head.
[38:13.560 --> 38:16.160]  That might be the perfect distillation of that
[38:16.160 --> 38:18.420]  relationship. Jesus Christ.
[38:18.620 --> 38:18.820]  Oh, man.
[38:19.580 --> 38:22.280]  I would hate that. Even if we could do that,
[38:22.340 --> 38:24.280]  I would hate that, because that means
[38:24.280 --> 38:26.360]  that we're only spending one day a week
[38:26.360 --> 38:26.980]  doing stuff.
[38:29.740 --> 38:30.940]  You guys are the only
[38:30.940 --> 38:32.720]  people on Earth I want to spend time with
[38:32.720 --> 38:33.980]  and I just want to be around you all the time.
[38:34.260 --> 38:36.320]  With the exception of my wife and dog and daughter, but you know what I mean?
[38:36.820 --> 38:37.300]  Yeah, absolutely.
[38:37.780 --> 38:40.140]  I get annoyed if it's like nine o'clock at night
[38:40.140 --> 38:42.400]  and I'm like, oh, I wonder if I should text the guys and see if they want to
[38:42.400 --> 38:43.980]  film something. I'm like, no, you can't. Don't do that.
[38:44.020 --> 38:46.120]  You can't do that. Just because you're awake
[38:46.120 --> 38:47.740]  and ready to film doesn't mean they are.
[38:48.580 --> 38:50.420]  You just had your first week away, as we mentioned
[38:50.420 --> 38:52.700]  earlier, and I was so excited to text you.
[38:53.340 --> 38:54.160]  Yeah, about it, because
[38:54.160 --> 38:55.860]  when I missed one
[38:56.540 --> 38:57.940]  day of gameplay recordings,
[38:58.400 --> 39:00.360]  I saw you guys in the Discord thing
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.160]  and I was like, oh man, my friends are having fun.
[39:02.620 --> 39:03.280]  I wish I was there.
[39:03.460 --> 39:06.180]  Like, I was the sick kid
[39:06.180 --> 39:08.300]  and I was looking out my window and I was seeing
[39:08.300 --> 39:10.180]  all the neighborhood kids play soccer
[39:10.180 --> 39:12.080]  or whatever and just being like, oh, I could
[39:12.080 --> 39:14.300]  be part of that. I'm missing
[39:14.300 --> 39:15.660]  that. That sucks.
[39:16.200 --> 39:17.060]  Very Secret Garden.
[39:17.640 --> 39:20.400]  Yeah, it was brutal
[39:20.400 --> 39:22.440]  especially because y'all, I didn't know
[39:22.440 --> 39:24.040]  ahead of time you were going to do this,
[39:24.500 --> 39:26.600]  but you guys decided to play GTA
[39:26.600 --> 39:28.060]  Heists. Not like
[39:28.060 --> 39:30.400]  Player Created Heists like we used to do back in the day
[39:30.400 --> 39:32.480]  with Achievement Hunter, but the Rockstar Created
[39:32.480 --> 39:34.340]  Heists, which Achievement Hunter also did.
[39:34.660 --> 39:36.460]  The irony there for me is that
[39:37.420 --> 39:38.460]  when Achievement Hunter
[39:38.460 --> 39:40.460]  went through and did all of those heists, I think
[39:40.460 --> 39:42.560]  there's like four of them or maybe five of them
[39:42.560 --> 39:44.500]  and they're like multi-part, you know? They take a
[39:44.500 --> 39:46.520]  while. I was out of town or something
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.380]  when they started it, and
[39:48.380 --> 39:50.460]  so I missed the boat.
[39:50.460 --> 39:52.480]  They already had their team set and they
[39:52.480 --> 39:54.680]  were going, and so I just never played
[39:54.680 --> 39:56.500]  or got to participate in any of that.
[39:56.880 --> 39:58.380]  I think I may have gotten to participate
[39:58.380 --> 40:00.540]  in one of the videos, like half of one
[40:00.540 --> 40:02.420]  of the videos. I just assumed that you
[40:02.420 --> 40:04.380]  had done all of them. No, and so
[40:04.380 --> 40:06.240]  I've never touched them, and so y'all
[40:06.240 --> 40:08.460]  starting it last week when I went out of town
[40:08.460 --> 40:10.620]  was such a wonderful
[40:11.300 --> 40:11.700]  nostalgic
[40:12.540 --> 40:14.320]  moment where I just thought, oh, I
[40:14.320 --> 40:16.120]  just want to drown myself in a bathtub.
[40:16.400 --> 40:18.640]  I'm never going to play these fucking games. Thank you so much.
[40:18.640 --> 40:20.640]  I'm so glad history does, in
[40:20.640 --> 40:22.560]  fact, repeat itself. I'm going to go kill
[40:22.560 --> 40:24.700]  myself now. I got more
[40:25.840 --> 40:26.600]  fake, not
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.620]  real beef, but annoyed with Gavin beef
[40:28.620 --> 40:30.680]  from that experience. From doing
[40:30.680 --> 40:32.620]  the heists? Yeah. I've
[40:32.620 --> 40:34.600]  never beaten the Humane Labs Raid
[40:34.600 --> 40:36.620]  heist, and I was so excited
[40:36.620 --> 40:38.540]  that now we're
[40:38.540 --> 40:40.640]  going to finally beat this heist that I've
[40:40.640 --> 40:42.780]  never finished. I've gotten to the last part
[40:42.780 --> 40:44.520]  of it every time, and then for
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.600]  whatever reason, the group I'm part
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.460]  of decides to just not
[40:48.460 --> 40:50.360]  follow through with it, and
[40:50.360 --> 40:52.480]  I was all excited to continue going. Gavin
[40:52.480 --> 40:54.420]  doesn't want to film the heist for a little bit.
[40:54.560 --> 40:56.640]  He wants to take a break from filming any more heist
[40:56.640 --> 40:58.460]  stuff, and I went, you son of a bitch.
[40:58.880 --> 41:00.440]  You motherfucker. The Humane Labs
[41:00.440 --> 41:02.460]  game. We can do it. We're just three videos ahead,
[41:02.540 --> 41:04.480]  and no one's even started editing the first one.
[41:04.780 --> 41:06.060]  We're going to be...
[41:06.060 --> 41:08.480]  I feel like there's stuff that's going to come out soon that we should make.
[41:08.600 --> 41:10.200]  I absolutely
[41:10.200 --> 41:12.320]  agree with you, Gavin. You're 100% right.
[41:12.480 --> 41:14.640]  I don't care, and I want to play Grand Theft Auto.
[41:15.120 --> 41:16.760]  What if you guys
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.860]  just deleted those
[41:18.860 --> 41:21.020]  three videos and never played it again?
[41:21.100 --> 41:22.700]  Why don't we just finish it,
[41:22.780 --> 41:24.700]  and then we have it, and then it'll come out eventually?
[41:25.020 --> 41:25.860]  Here's what we should do.
[41:27.840 --> 41:29.000]  I've already done all these.
[41:29.560 --> 41:30.720]  I should swap out with Geoff
[41:30.720 --> 41:32.720]  and watch. We can't do that halfway
[41:32.720 --> 41:34.820]  through the heist. You guys have a crew set. You can't
[41:34.820 --> 41:36.060]  do that. It's a terrible idea.
[41:36.460 --> 41:38.660]  We can't switch out. We're halfway
[41:38.660 --> 41:40.780]  through a heist right now. I just have to miss out on this
[41:40.780 --> 41:42.600]  one. And you know,
[41:42.600 --> 41:44.460]  when we start a new company in 10 years, I'll
[41:44.460 --> 41:46.660]  miss out on those two. Okay, what if we
[41:46.660 --> 41:48.320]  wrap up this heist, which is the second one?
[41:48.720 --> 41:50.480]  Or the third one, I guess, because we skipped the first one.
[41:50.760 --> 41:52.100]  And then Geoff comes in for the rest.
[41:53.240 --> 41:54.440]  Who am I replacing?
[41:55.120 --> 41:55.940]  Who am I replacing?
[41:56.240 --> 41:57.980]  No, you guys have a thing set.
[41:58.580 --> 42:00.460]  Here's the thing. The problem with that is
[42:00.460 --> 42:02.440]  you need to be here, Gavin, because you've
[42:02.440 --> 42:04.440]  become the absolute worst influence
[42:04.440 --> 42:06.580]  on Nick, and it is so fascinating
[42:07.120 --> 42:08.560]  how to see Nick
[42:09.160 --> 42:10.360]  unravel. I've learned
[42:10.360 --> 42:12.300]  that there are new and improved ways to fail
[42:12.300 --> 42:14.580]  those heists that I didn't think were even possible.
[42:15.800 --> 42:18.500]  And it has bled into other
[42:18.500 --> 42:20.260]  facets of our work.
[42:20.640 --> 42:22.360]  You have turned Nick into
[42:22.360 --> 42:24.320]  a chaotic, unpredictable
[42:24.320 --> 42:25.180]  mess.
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.260]  It was started in GTA,
[42:28.540 --> 42:30.320]  it bled into what we did our last
[42:30.320 --> 42:32.200]  Twitch stream. Eric was like,
[42:32.280 --> 42:34.440]  I want to tell Gavin this story
[42:34.440 --> 42:36.460]  about speed, and then Nick was like,
[42:36.480 --> 42:38.300]  well, let me sync us up for the stream, and then
[42:38.300 --> 42:39.740]  it was like, okay, we'll do that.
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.240]  And as soon as we synced, Nick just went, okay, we're
[42:42.240 --> 42:42.740]  live!
[42:43.720 --> 42:46.280]  And we were like three minutes early.
[42:47.060 --> 42:48.260]  And so then Eric just had to
[42:48.260 --> 42:49.540]  talk about speed for three minutes.
[42:50.040 --> 42:52.240]  Nick is unpredictable right now in a way that
[42:52.240 --> 42:54.040]  is so uncharacteristic
[42:54.040 --> 42:56.160]  of how I've known Nick for like the
[42:56.160 --> 42:58.020]  past four years, and it's great.
[42:58.500 --> 43:00.260]  You know what? Andrew, I'm glad you
[43:00.260 --> 43:02.240]  brought this up, and I feel like maybe it's time to finally
[43:02.240 --> 43:04.360]  talk about something that I have
[43:04.360 --> 43:05.740]  been keeping secret for a long time.
[43:06.300 --> 43:07.000]  This is
[43:07.620 --> 43:09.920]  what we call the Gavin Effect.
[43:10.420 --> 43:12.000]  And the most clear example
[43:12.000 --> 43:13.400]  of it I think I can
[43:13.400 --> 43:15.760]  give to you all is not a part of this
[43:15.760 --> 43:17.600]  podcast, but certainly podcast adjacent,
[43:17.800 --> 43:19.260]  I guess, in some roles.
[43:19.880 --> 43:21.760]  You guys remember Michael Jones used to work at Achievement
[43:21.760 --> 43:23.620]  Hunter with us? He does the food podcast with us.
[43:23.860 --> 43:25.880]  Completely different human
[43:25.880 --> 43:27.620]  being before I introduced him to Gavin.
[43:28.840 --> 43:29.440]  Just like
[43:29.440 --> 43:32.060]  calm, respectful, quiet.
[43:32.580 --> 43:33.960]  Did he like to do crossword
[43:33.960 --> 43:35.780]  puzzles a lot? I don't buy any of that.
[43:35.780 --> 43:37.380]  Kind of like a deep thinker.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.100]  Mousy, nerdy guy. And then I introduced him to Gavin
[43:40.100 --> 43:42.100]  and like three weeks later he turned into jersey trash
[43:42.100 --> 43:43.560]  and I don't know where it came from, but
[43:43.560 --> 43:45.880]  it's this thing that Gavin has on
[43:45.880 --> 43:48.100]  some people. And what I'm saying is
[43:48.100 --> 43:49.320]  Nick is gonna get worse.
[43:49.940 --> 43:50.040]  Uh-oh.
[43:51.980 --> 43:53.860]  I think... I believe that.
[43:54.200 --> 43:55.820]  I believe the Nick's gonna get worse part.
[43:56.220 --> 43:57.820]  But I'm excited to see it.
[43:59.060 --> 44:00.100]  Even if I sit
[44:00.100 --> 44:01.940]  out and Geoff fills my slot,
[44:01.940 --> 44:02.880]  I can still be
[44:04.140 --> 44:05.920]  in the recording and I can still
[44:05.920 --> 44:08.160]  watch Nick's feed and I can still
[44:08.960 --> 44:10.240]  have the same effect.
[44:10.400 --> 44:11.980]  I don't know if that's good for my mental health.
[44:12.180 --> 44:13.120]  You're like a siren.
[44:13.660 --> 44:14.340]  It's the worst.
[44:15.160 --> 44:17.800]  He just steers the
[44:17.800 --> 44:19.520]  fucking ship towards the rocks
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.420]  because you whisper in his fucking ear.
[44:21.680 --> 44:22.920]  Like it's the worst.
[44:23.600 --> 44:25.340]  I don't want to spoil a video, but
[44:25.940 --> 44:27.940]  we were in the midst
[44:27.940 --> 44:29.920]  of something and Gavin
[44:29.920 --> 44:31.980]  made an insane declaration.
[44:32.360 --> 44:33.480]  And we were
[44:33.480 --> 44:35.960]  so like... things were so okay
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.940]  that I wasn't even looking at
[44:37.940 --> 44:40.020]  my screen anymore. I was opening...
[44:40.020 --> 44:41.940]  I was in a food app getting ready to order
[44:41.940 --> 44:43.800]  myself lunch because we were
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.500]  good to go.
[44:46.080 --> 44:47.760]  And Gavin yelled something
[44:47.760 --> 44:49.820]  and I went, do I have to look up and
[44:49.820 --> 44:52.060]  shut down what's happening? Nah, it's fine.
[44:52.580 --> 44:53.520]  We're all good.
[44:53.900 --> 44:55.900]  And then we were not all good.
[44:56.080 --> 44:57.900]  We were very much not
[44:57.900 --> 44:58.440]  all good.
[44:59.800 --> 45:01.980]  And that has just been
[45:01.980 --> 45:03.760]  insane. Nick has been a crazy person
[45:03.760 --> 45:05.120]  in a great way.
[45:06.360 --> 45:07.360]  Completely unpredictable.
[45:08.020 --> 45:10.140]  The Nick flowering, as it were.
[45:10.680 --> 45:10.860]  Yeah.
[45:11.960 --> 45:12.340]  I'm helping.
[45:13.820 --> 45:16.060]  Oh man. He just keeps saying
[45:16.060 --> 45:17.900]  I'm helping. It's the worst.
[45:20.120 --> 45:21.860]  Speaking of video games, y'all know
[45:21.860 --> 45:23.600]  how I've been soda streaming for a while?
[45:24.440 --> 45:25.920]  Of course. How much I fucking love
[45:25.920 --> 45:27.400]  soda streaming. I got really into streaming.
[45:27.920 --> 45:30.140]  Yesterday I started doing the other one. Twitch streaming.
[45:30.360 --> 45:31.200]  How did that go?
[45:32.580 --> 45:34.100]  Good. Good. Eric came
[45:34.100 --> 45:35.860]  over and he helped me set up my
[45:36.360 --> 45:38.040]  Twitch account. Fake Geoff
[45:38.040 --> 45:39.920]  is my name. I think I must have made
[45:39.920 --> 45:41.980]  when we were doing GTA and Achievement
[45:41.980 --> 45:43.980]  Hunter or something. Back when we had the fake age crew.
[45:45.080 --> 45:45.480]  And
[45:45.940 --> 45:48.100]  I did my first ever stream. I streamed
[45:48.100 --> 45:49.720]  for an hour yesterday to two people.
[45:50.440 --> 45:52.280]  Why don't you just stream on our podcast
[45:52.280 --> 45:53.760]  account? Why are you using your own
[45:53.760 --> 45:55.900]  mini account? Just to have it built up
[45:55.900 --> 45:57.760]  so that if we ever have to do like multiple
[45:57.760 --> 45:59.780]  streams or like if we, like you know, Gavin and I
[45:59.780 --> 46:01.780]  did that stream with some of the old Achievement Hunter guys
[46:01.780 --> 46:03.780]  and I wasn't able to stream it. I just
[46:03.780 --> 46:05.760]  played and I'd like to have a presence that
[46:05.760 --> 46:07.380]  that's not necessarily our main account.
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.360]  I just figured it would help with flexibility.
[46:10.700 --> 46:11.900]  He's a contingency
[46:11.900 --> 46:13.780]  for when this falls apart. At least he has his Twitch
[46:13.780 --> 46:15.660]  channel. Yeah, there's that too.
[46:16.000 --> 46:17.820]  And I know Gus is, or Gus, Gavin's been
[46:17.820 --> 46:18.620]  working on his
[46:19.460 --> 46:21.680]  getting his Twitch streaming stuff up in the background
[46:21.680 --> 46:23.360]  too. I just figured we might as well all have it.
[46:23.620 --> 46:25.720]  It feels weird to be like the
[46:25.720 --> 46:27.720]  one who doesn't have it. I'm gonna burn
[46:27.720 --> 46:28.380]  mine down though.
[46:29.380 --> 46:30.400]  You're having trouble here.
[46:32.880 --> 46:33.460]  What's the
[46:33.460 --> 46:35.580]  problem? I've got too many camera
[46:35.580 --> 46:37.720]  feeds. I'm trying to do it from a pinball
[46:37.720 --> 46:39.680]  machine, which isn't smart to
[46:39.680 --> 46:41.620]  begin with. I need like three cameras and
[46:41.620 --> 46:43.220]  for some reason every
[46:43.220 --> 46:45.620]  Elgato piece of hardware I
[46:45.620 --> 46:47.640]  have works 50%
[46:47.640 --> 46:49.700]  of the time. I want to smash all of
[46:49.700 --> 46:51.520]  it into tiny little pieces. Is there
[46:51.520 --> 46:53.620]  a better solution than Elgato you could use?
[46:53.700 --> 46:54.740]  Yeah, black magic.
[46:55.080 --> 46:57.880]  Like actual
[46:57.880 --> 46:58.860]  professional shit.
[47:01.080 --> 47:01.720]  It's just
[47:01.720 --> 47:03.580]  like much more expensive.
[47:04.100 --> 47:05.220]  Yeah, real shit for actual people.
[47:05.340 --> 47:07.680]  You gotta spend money to make pinball money.
[47:07.700 --> 47:09.580]  Real shit for actual people is such a funny
[47:09.580 --> 47:11.020]  tagline for a company.
[47:13.160 --> 47:13.720]  But like
[47:13.720 --> 47:15.580]  I just can't. There's
[47:15.580 --> 47:17.740]  nothing worse than when you're trying to
[47:17.740 --> 47:19.560]  do the fun thing
[47:19.560 --> 47:21.660]  and you're like I'm excited about this new project
[47:21.660 --> 47:23.740]  that I'm going to do and I have all the things that I
[47:23.740 --> 47:25.420]  need and you start doing it and you go
[47:25.420 --> 47:27.540]  none of this works and I'm in a hell
[47:27.540 --> 47:29.700]  of my own making. I just can't
[47:29.700 --> 47:31.640]  figure out and OBS is
[47:31.640 --> 47:33.780]  a freaking piece of shit. Probably not
[47:33.780 --> 47:35.620]  and I just don't know how to use it. But why
[47:35.620 --> 47:37.840]  is it that if I like lose a feed of one of my cameras
[47:37.840 --> 47:39.580]  and it just starts shitting out green
[47:39.580 --> 47:41.660]  do I have to go into the properties
[47:42.560 --> 47:43.560]  pick what it is
[47:43.560 --> 47:45.760]  select something different and then select the thing
[47:45.760 --> 47:47.420]  again. Why isn't there just like a
[47:48.160 --> 47:49.340]  refresh device button?
[47:49.820 --> 47:51.880]  I think there's a deactivate
[47:51.880 --> 47:52.460]  and an activate.
[47:53.440 --> 47:54.360]  What is that?
[47:55.520 --> 47:57.640]  I'm just saying. Are you talking about
[47:57.640 --> 47:58.440]  the little eyeball?
[47:59.600 --> 48:01.600]  There's that but I think you can double click on it
[48:01.600 --> 48:03.860]  and there's an activate deactivate thing in the middle
[48:03.860 --> 48:05.720]  there that like turns it off as a source and then
[48:05.720 --> 48:07.720]  turns it back on. Okay, I'm slightly less
[48:07.720 --> 48:09.800]  annoyed. But that might not even
[48:09.800 --> 48:11.860]  be the right thing. Because it's Elgato
[48:11.860 --> 48:13.780]  you might really have to switch off from it
[48:13.780 --> 48:15.920]  and come back. Is you trying to do
[48:15.920 --> 48:17.740]  the pinball thing related to what I talked to you about?
[48:18.300 --> 48:20.220]  No. Oh, just completely unrelated?
[48:20.240 --> 48:21.260]  That's a different pinball thing.
[48:21.800 --> 48:23.020]  That's a different pinball? I thought
[48:24.060 --> 48:25.760]  you were... I'm trying to get Gavin
[48:25.760 --> 48:27.740]  to challenge me in a pinball score off
[48:27.740 --> 48:29.780]  and I thought that you were going to use
[48:29.780 --> 48:31.800]  your physical cabinet while I did the virtual
[48:31.800 --> 48:33.840]  one, was what you were doing. That's a
[48:33.840 --> 48:36.040]  hilarious complaint. I mean, if you can get the virtual
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.860]  version of my physical one
[48:37.860 --> 48:39.840]  I have a virtual version of
[48:39.840 --> 48:41.920]  one of your physical ones. I've been playing it
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.900]  a decent amount. That's an interesting
[48:43.900 --> 48:46.020]  challenge. Wait, you have
[48:46.020 --> 48:47.940]  a virtual version of a
[48:47.940 --> 48:50.000]  real pinball machine that Gavin has? Yes.
[48:50.840 --> 48:51.560]  Wow. The
[48:51.560 --> 48:53.920]  Champions Ball or whatever. What's
[48:53.920 --> 48:55.560]  the bar one? Champion Pub.
[48:56.120 --> 48:57.960]  Champion Pub, yeah. That's great. That's not the
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.980]  one I've plugged in. Okay.
[49:00.220 --> 49:00.760]  Well, I'm just
[49:01.680 --> 49:03.280]  saying I have one of the four.
[49:03.940 --> 49:05.960]  Ken, is this something you... Gavin, are you
[49:05.960 --> 49:07.560]  interested in participating in this?
[49:08.160 --> 49:10.040]  Yeah. He's a pinball guy.
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.960]  You have Champion Pub, the one where
[49:11.960 --> 49:13.960]  you have to shoot the ball at the guy and the little
[49:13.960 --> 49:15.800]  punching bag and the jumper rope and stuff?
[49:16.060 --> 49:17.860]  You have that? Yeah, the punch bag and then it spins around
[49:17.860 --> 49:19.900]  and it's a bloke and you can hit him in the face.
[49:20.460 --> 49:21.720]  That's like the coolest
[49:22.860 --> 49:24.000]  pinball machine. You have
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  the coolest pinball machine. Yeah, if
[49:26.000 --> 49:27.960]  you enjoy the pinball slamming into the
[49:27.960 --> 49:29.860]  glass and scaring the shit out of you, then
[49:29.860 --> 49:30.960]  that's the one for you.
[49:32.380 --> 49:33.940]  Gavin, do you think he could beat you
[49:33.940 --> 49:35.900]  or do you think he could beat him? How confident
[49:35.900 --> 49:38.120]  are you? I'm not much of a pinball
[49:38.120 --> 49:40.140]  guy. I think Gavin has the edge. Gavin's a
[49:40.140 --> 49:42.180]  big pinball guy. Real quiet about it,
[49:42.220 --> 49:43.980]  but real big into it. Yeah, it's like a
[49:43.980 --> 49:45.980]  little secret background hobby. I'm into it.
[49:46.220 --> 49:47.740]  Not so secret now. Nah.
[49:47.880 --> 49:49.500]  Not as of episode 10 of this podcast.
[49:51.160 --> 49:51.520]  Uh...
[49:51.520 --> 49:53.940]  Oh man, I kind of want to put money on this.
[49:54.620 --> 49:56.180]  I wanted it to be like the Halo
[49:56.180 --> 49:57.920]  2 race we did where I was streaming,
[49:58.100 --> 50:00.120]  like we'd go back and forth and I would stream
[50:00.900 --> 50:02.200]  this virtual pinball game
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.080]  I've been playing. I would probably just have to
[50:04.080 --> 50:06.000]  play the virtual one, though, to keep it fair.
[50:06.000 --> 50:07.760]  I mean, whatever works.
[50:08.060 --> 50:09.880]  There's a whole other kind of
[50:10.480 --> 50:12.020]  element to this that's like, is
[50:12.020 --> 50:14.000]  there a difference between the virtual
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.060]  and the analog version?
[50:17.160 --> 50:18.080]  Well, I mean, the ability to
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.920]  slam it around and tilt
[50:19.920 --> 50:22.020]  and, you know, nudge
[50:22.020 --> 50:24.000]  the ball around is probably easier on a real one.
[50:24.960 --> 50:25.980]  There's a tilt button
[50:25.980 --> 50:27.980]  on the virtual one. You have that button on the virtual one, though,
[50:27.980 --> 50:29.820]  I guarantee you. Does it have, like, directional
[50:29.820 --> 50:31.600]  nudging? Yeah, left or right tilt.
[50:32.260 --> 50:33.440]  Yeah. Up and down?
[50:34.040 --> 50:35.600]  Not up and down, but left and right.
[50:36.420 --> 50:37.460]  But if it doesn't, I mean,
[50:37.460 --> 50:39.520]  that would give you the advantage on the real one.
[50:39.560 --> 50:41.540]  But for some reason, to me, I feel like the
[50:41.540 --> 50:43.500]  virtual version would be easier to get
[50:43.500 --> 50:45.500]  a high score on. What's cool about the virtual
[50:45.500 --> 50:47.100]  version is you can toggle between
[50:47.100 --> 50:49.380]  what the actual table board is like
[50:49.380 --> 50:51.280]  and what the, like, video game version of it is.
[50:51.400 --> 50:53.360]  So, like, if you do the actual version,
[50:53.440 --> 50:55.660]  it's just, like, that guy standing there
[50:55.660 --> 50:57.440]  taking hits, but, like,
[50:57.480 --> 50:59.540]  the video game one, he's swinging his fists
[50:59.540 --> 51:01.360]  when he's hitting and, like, there's just some
[51:01.360 --> 51:03.580]  additional graphics to it. He swings his fist
[51:03.580 --> 51:05.400]  in the real one. Oh, does he? Okay, well
[51:05.400 --> 51:07.380]  it's just, like, I think the range of motion
[51:07.380 --> 51:09.400]  is more... there's, like, a
[51:09.400 --> 51:11.560]  video game-ized version of the board
[51:11.560 --> 51:13.520]  and then what the real board kind of
[51:13.520 --> 51:15.340]  works as. Interesting.
[51:16.940 --> 51:17.340]  Um...
[51:17.340 --> 51:18.640]  I'm really excited about it.
[51:19.300 --> 51:21.400]  I've been playing a lot of Snoopy pinballs while I sent
[51:21.400 --> 51:23.540]  that to Eric. I'm all
[51:23.540 --> 51:25.400]  into pinball right now. Virtual pinball.
[51:25.940 --> 51:27.520]  Haven't been in a
[51:27.520 --> 51:28.840]  long time into it, but
[51:28.840 --> 51:31.020]  having a blast. Did you ever play Sonic
[51:31.020 --> 51:32.940]  Spinball? Uh...
[51:32.940 --> 51:34.840]  No, I don't think so. I played the Pokemon
[51:34.840 --> 51:36.860]  pinball. God, I hate that game. Sonic
[51:36.860 --> 51:38.080]  Spinball? Sucks.
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.840]  Are you not a pinball guy, Eric?
[51:41.640 --> 51:42.360]  Uh, no.
[51:42.640 --> 51:44.840]  If it's free play, I like pinball, but if I have to pay
[51:44.840 --> 51:46.740]  for it, I hate it. Also, I owned Sonic Spinball
[51:46.740 --> 51:48.480]  when I was a kid, and I fuck it. Ugh, misery.
[51:48.900 --> 51:49.820]  Really miserable game.
[51:50.740 --> 51:52.620]  I've been playing another
[51:52.620 --> 51:53.460]  Geoff favorite.
[51:54.740 --> 51:57.140]  I got my toes, I dipped my toes
[51:57.140 --> 51:59.220]  in the Call of the Wild Angler.
[51:59.780 --> 52:01.160]  Oh! You've been fishing?
[52:02.060 --> 52:03.080]  A little bit.
[52:03.340 --> 52:05.260]  I fished one night. To say
[52:05.260 --> 52:07.260]  I've been fishing is maybe a little bit of a
[52:07.260 --> 52:08.880]  stretch. And I had fun.
[52:09.380 --> 52:11.220]  It's a fun game. It does the annoying thing
[52:11.220 --> 52:12.940]  where you have to make an account when you load in.
[52:13.340 --> 52:15.120]  I hate that shit so much.
[52:15.460 --> 52:17.140]  Yeah, it's so useless. I had
[52:17.140 --> 52:19.180]  such an unexpected laugh from it, where
[52:19.180 --> 52:21.160]  you have to catch your first fish, and they
[52:21.160 --> 52:23.240]  like, every time you catch fish, you celebrate.
[52:24.000 --> 52:24.880]  And I got the
[52:24.880 --> 52:27.000]  I got the tiniest piece of shit
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  fish. Just a little baby fish.
[52:29.140 --> 52:30.200]  And I was just, look at my fish.
[52:30.640 --> 52:32.220]  Look at how happy I am with my fish.
[52:32.740 --> 52:34.680]  Got this tiny little fish.
[52:35.080 --> 52:36.920]  Showing it off. It's like an inch
[52:36.920 --> 52:38.780]  long. There's nothing
[52:39.700 --> 52:40.980]  impressive about this fish.
[52:41.100 --> 52:43.060]  We're just like, hey, look at this. Look at what I did.
[52:44.000 --> 52:45.000]  Hey man, humble beginnings.
[52:45.400 --> 52:47.020]  You keep at it, and you'll catch a gold
[52:47.020 --> 52:48.940]  fish someday. Not a gold fish, but
[52:48.940 --> 52:50.300]  a gold level fish.
[52:50.680 --> 52:51.400]  And it'll be huge.
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.380]  I like it. The fish is so
[52:53.380 --> 52:55.700]  small, his thumb is like smothering
[52:55.700 --> 52:57.500]  it. Yeah, his thumb is
[52:57.500 --> 52:59.360]  larger. Is that what your beard looks like?
[52:59.860 --> 53:00.840]  Uh, it's
[53:01.400 --> 53:03.180]  like, yeah, it's kind of close to it.
[53:03.820 --> 53:05.200]  I think that's a good comparable.
[53:05.580 --> 53:07.140]  0.04
[53:07.140 --> 53:07.960]  kilograms.
[53:09.100 --> 53:11.420]  I have no idea how much that weighs. It was small.
[53:11.880 --> 53:13.420]  Could someone with Photoshop put that
[53:13.420 --> 53:14.580]  beard on the picture of Andrew?
[53:17.840 --> 53:18.620]  I'll, uh,
[53:19.140 --> 53:20.640]  I'll see, I'll give a thumbs up
[53:20.640 --> 53:22.940]  if it's close or not to the current beard situation.
[53:23.080 --> 53:24.060]  If that gets done.
[53:24.360 --> 53:26.540]  But I caught my fish, and then I walked into
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.540]  the water by accident, and it crashed
[53:28.540 --> 53:30.560]  the game. And that was my time to follow the
[53:30.560 --> 53:32.480]  Lyle Angler. But I'm excited
[53:32.480 --> 53:33.360]  to get back into it.
[53:34.400 --> 53:36.400]  Yeah, it's a real peaceful game. It's also
[53:36.400 --> 53:38.420]  fun driving. You just get in an SUV
[53:38.420 --> 53:40.440]  and just drive around. It's pretty forgiving
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.960]  with the driving physics.
[53:42.600 --> 53:44.640]  What the hell is a blood worm? Is that a real thing?
[53:45.140 --> 53:46.460]  Yeah. It's like
[53:46.460 --> 53:47.900]  a blood sausage, but it's a worm.
[53:48.300 --> 53:50.160]  Yeah. Which is really
[53:50.160 --> 53:52.300]  all a sausage is, right? A big worm.
[53:52.540 --> 53:53.600]  Yeah, exactly.
[53:55.040 --> 53:56.640]  I realized my weird fear.
[53:57.320 --> 53:58.180]  I'm happy.
[53:58.660 --> 53:59.360]  For the fear diagram?
[54:00.220 --> 54:02.220]  Yeah, I got one. I didn't
[54:02.220 --> 54:03.840]  consider this a fear, but I was like,
[54:03.920 --> 54:05.800]  it kind of aligns with Gavin's wet bread.
[54:07.320 --> 54:08.720]  Um, I hate
[54:09.220 --> 54:09.700]  paper.
[54:10.260 --> 54:11.220]  Paper cups.
[54:12.260 --> 54:13.780]  Not a fan of paper cups.
[54:13.780 --> 54:14.880]  These things.
[54:16.240 --> 54:17.880]  I'll send a photo right now.
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.200]  I know my fear.
[54:19.880 --> 54:20.400]  Paper.
[54:21.900 --> 54:23.620]  You know those triangle paper cups?
[54:24.200 --> 54:25.380]  Yeah. The thought
[54:26.080 --> 54:27.400]  of the texture
[54:27.400 --> 54:29.940]  on my lips gives
[54:29.940 --> 54:30.960]  me goosebumps.
[54:31.340 --> 54:32.620]  It gives you chills, right?
[54:32.820 --> 54:35.540]  It chills me all over.
[54:35.900 --> 54:37.620]  Yep, I have that too. It makes me so
[54:37.620 --> 54:39.640]  uncomfortable. Yep. Scratching
[54:39.640 --> 54:41.820]  of cardboard, same thing, but it's largely
[54:41.820 --> 54:44.000]  like paper texture. Don't like
[54:44.000 --> 54:44.940]  it. At all.
[54:46.880 --> 54:49.060]  Fear I don't have.
[54:49.300 --> 54:51.800]  A wet hand touching
[54:51.800 --> 54:53.860]  paper is
[54:53.860 --> 54:54.580]  like...
[54:54.580 --> 54:57.980]  I look...
[54:57.980 --> 54:59.120]  This.
[54:59.900 --> 55:01.820]  The thought of like biting on paper
[55:01.820 --> 55:03.420]  and getting it stuck to my lips.
[55:03.960 --> 55:05.160]  Yeah, it makes
[55:05.710 --> 55:07.780]  me feel so bad on
[55:07.780 --> 55:09.960]  the inside. It like physically pains
[55:09.960 --> 55:11.360]  me. Yeah. That sounds
[55:11.760 --> 55:13.720]  similar to someone I know who has...
[55:13.720 --> 55:15.660]  They can't touch like a wooden spoon.
[55:15.960 --> 55:17.960]  It's like too grippy if they drag their finger
[55:17.960 --> 55:19.300]  on it. Do you have that?
[55:19.800 --> 55:20.020]  What?
[55:21.820 --> 55:23.780]  Like, you know that wood that's kind of
[55:23.780 --> 55:24.940]  grippy? If you like
[55:24.940 --> 55:27.600]  pull your finger across a wooden spoon, it like
[55:27.600 --> 55:28.580]  grips and releases.
[55:30.320 --> 55:31.780]  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[55:32.040 --> 55:33.780]  I don't like popsicle sticks, though.
[55:34.940 --> 55:35.840]  Not a fan of those.
[55:37.280 --> 55:37.720]  But
[55:37.720 --> 55:39.220]  paper is way worse.
[55:39.900 --> 55:41.240]  Way worse with paper.
[55:41.500 --> 55:43.700]  I'm like a golf ball. Like, I have dimples
[55:43.700 --> 55:45.600]  right now. Like, I'm just... I have goosebumps
[55:45.600 --> 55:46.300]  all over.
[55:48.020 --> 55:49.280]  Not a fan.
[55:49.560 --> 55:51.640]  So that is my fear. But I'm not like... I didn't
[55:51.640 --> 55:53.520]  consider that because it's not like I'm
[55:53.520 --> 55:55.500]  avoiding paper cups.
[55:55.820 --> 55:57.820]  It just triggers something in me
[55:57.820 --> 55:59.640]  that is unexplainable and makes me
[55:59.640 --> 56:00.400]  feel very uncomfortable.
[56:01.220 --> 56:03.560]  Which I think falls in the spirit of
[56:03.560 --> 56:04.660]  our fear diagram.
[56:04.660 --> 56:06.820]  If we have a
[56:06.820 --> 56:08.980]  fear diagram, Andrew, and we overlap,
[56:09.320 --> 56:11.020]  our overlap is just this.
[56:11.380 --> 56:12.520]  This is paper, yeah.
[56:13.060 --> 56:14.800]  It doesn't have anything to do with getting my blood
[56:14.800 --> 56:16.860]  pressure taken. This is such a... I hate this
[56:16.860 --> 56:18.840]  feeling. Your fear diagram is a straight line.
[56:19.620 --> 56:19.640]  Yeah.
[56:21.940 --> 56:22.720]  When did people
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.260]  decide that was an acceptable cup
[56:24.260 --> 56:26.760]  as well? Like, what was wrong with just stacking
[56:26.760 --> 56:27.520]  normal cups?
[56:28.660 --> 56:30.360]  Geoff, do you think it was like the 50s?
[56:30.540 --> 56:33.080]  I think it's people who are working on cars in the 50s.
[56:33.080 --> 56:35.060]  Yeah, it was like, they used to be waxy too.
[56:35.200 --> 56:37.180]  Sometimes you can get them waxy and they last a little bit longer.
[56:37.420 --> 56:38.900]  But they're like single use.
[56:39.060 --> 56:40.640]  They're dog shit. They always
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.100]  crease in the middle. I haven't
[56:43.100 --> 56:45.140]  seen them in a while. Usually if you do
[56:45.140 --> 56:46.980]  see them, it's only at like an...
[56:46.980 --> 56:48.660]  at like a mechanic shop
[56:49.040 --> 56:50.280]  or a car wash.
[56:51.380 --> 56:53.180]  Yeah, it's like, let's invent a cup that you can't
[56:53.180 --> 56:53.580]  put down.
[56:54.700 --> 56:56.220]  Yeah, you definitely can't put it down anywhere.
[56:57.120 --> 56:58.960]  I remember making this realization
[56:58.960 --> 57:00.940]  when I was in a bank as a child.
[57:00.940 --> 57:02.700]  That was where they had, they had like the little
[57:02.700 --> 57:05.040]  water thing and those.
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.000]  It was an attachment to the machine.
[57:07.460 --> 57:09.220]  And just trying to drink water out of that cup
[57:09.220 --> 57:10.720]  and just being like, this is fucking weird.
[57:11.020 --> 57:11.700]  I don't like this.
[57:13.180 --> 57:14.760]  When are we doing our
[57:14.760 --> 57:15.420]  throat goat?
[57:17.680 --> 57:18.800]  We need to...
[57:18.800 --> 57:21.160]  I forgot that that was a thing
[57:21.160 --> 57:22.300]  and just remembered...
[57:22.300 --> 57:24.160]  We've all gotta spit our mouth full into a Pyrex.
[57:24.500 --> 57:26.640]  And then we're gonna put those lines,
[57:27.020 --> 57:28.360]  the amounts, on a Gerpler.
[57:28.360 --> 57:30.780]  I am so excited
[57:31.520 --> 57:32.660]  to get that phone
[57:32.660 --> 57:34.620]  you sent me, Gavin, so I can send you a scan of my head.
[57:35.020 --> 57:36.120]  I want that so badly.
[57:36.740 --> 57:37.800]  Yeah, have you not got the phone yet?
[57:38.220 --> 57:39.920]  Not yet. No, still waiting on the package.
[57:40.100 --> 57:41.600]  Yeah, it was supposed to arrive last Wednesday.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.560]  I think we're still waiting on Andrew to get a puzzle too, right?
[57:44.620 --> 57:45.960]  I'm also waiting on the puzzle, yes.
[57:46.140 --> 57:48.420]  Like, I thought it was delivered, but it was the
[57:48.420 --> 57:49.480]  wrong order that
[57:50.460 --> 57:52.260]  everyone else's got delivered, yours hasn't yet.
[57:52.540 --> 57:54.500]  I think the person Andrew is using
[57:54.940 --> 57:56.280]  on Vancouver Island to
[57:56.280 --> 57:58.500]  forward his stuff to where he actually lives
[57:58.500 --> 58:00.180]  and won't tell us, I think that person's
[58:00.180 --> 58:02.120]  dropping the ball. Well, I think that they
[58:02.120 --> 58:04.300]  moved into an old age home.
[58:05.920 --> 58:08.140]  Do you think Andrew even lives in Canada?
[58:08.400 --> 58:10.320]  What if he lives in, like, Pflugerville?
[58:13.120 --> 58:13.520]  Crazy.
[58:14.580 --> 58:16.000]  I bet that's the hold-up.
[58:16.040 --> 58:18.120]  It takes a long time to ship a package to Canada
[58:18.120 --> 58:20.040]  and then back to where it came from.
[58:21.900 --> 58:23.960]  Yeah, this country's iffy on, like, re-importing.
[58:28.120 --> 58:28.860]  Oh man,
[58:28.980 --> 58:30.780]  you would be so mad if I was
[58:30.780 --> 58:32.320]  doing that, if I was making you all
[58:32.320 --> 58:34.840]  ship something to Canada for the annoyance
[58:34.840 --> 58:36.720]  of it. And pretending that you were on Pacific Time
[58:36.720 --> 58:38.640]  the whole time? I'm actually
[58:38.640 --> 58:40.180]  on the East Coast, I'm an hour ahead.
[58:41.400 --> 58:42.440]  You just want to wake up at noon.
[58:45.920 --> 58:48.560]  I have an idea
[58:48.560 --> 58:50.400]  on how to grow our podcast
[58:50.400 --> 58:52.580]  organically. I wanted to pitch you guys
[58:52.580 --> 58:54.620]  real fast before we end, if you guys are
[58:54.620 --> 58:56.520]  okay with it. Of course. I hate
[58:56.520 --> 58:58.540]  that my brain imagined the podcast as a
[58:58.540 --> 59:00.280]  seed in a pot. Okay.
[59:00.460 --> 59:02.660]  I posted a photo. Geoff just posted
[59:02.660 --> 59:04.340]  a photo of Michael J. Fox,
[59:04.580 --> 59:05.880]  an autographed image.
[59:06.820 --> 59:08.700]  And it says, try the shakes.
[59:09.500 --> 59:10.780]  It's hanging in a restaurant
[59:10.780 --> 59:12.420]  somewhere. I
[59:12.420 --> 59:14.460]  recently was in Toledo,
[59:14.640 --> 59:16.600]  Ohio, and I ate at a place
[59:16.600 --> 59:18.440]  called fuckin' Tony
[59:18.440 --> 59:20.520]  Paco's, I think. It was like a hot dog restaurant, like a
[59:20.520 --> 59:22.500]  Polish hot dog restaurant. Or Hungarian,
[59:22.500 --> 59:24.260]  I think. But they were,
[59:24.280 --> 59:26.360]  they're on the map, because they
[59:26.360 --> 59:28.720]  are, they have,
[59:28.900 --> 59:30.360]  they maintain the world's
[59:31.380 --> 59:32.100]  largest collection
[59:33.140 --> 59:34.860]  of celebrity autographed
[59:34.860 --> 59:35.760]  hot dog buns.
[59:37.660 --> 59:38.600]  Speaking of which, by the way,
[59:38.660 --> 59:40.420]  guess who I saw there? Fuckin' Kevin Costner.
[59:40.560 --> 59:42.020]  I took a picture. I'll load it up right now.
[59:42.680 --> 59:44.460]  Oh, Horizon, go get your
[59:44.460 --> 59:45.880]  tickets. There are plenty available.
[59:49.100 --> 59:50.460]  You know what? There are. There are
[59:50.460 --> 59:51.940]  plenty available for you if you want to see it.
[59:51.940 --> 59:52.880]  Whenever time you want to go.
[59:54.600 --> 59:56.580]  Anyway, and I was, while I was there,
[59:56.640 --> 59:58.480]  I was just looking around. You know, I did
[59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.440]  the, I got up three different times
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.420]  to look at the hot dog buns. And go
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.480]  like, oh, look, there's a celebrity, there's a celebrity. Oh, that's cool.
[01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:05.640]  And then I realized,
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.220]  everybody around me was doing it. Everybody
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.340]  is going there and looking at the hot dog buns
[01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.800]  and looking at the celebrities, right?
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.320]  So that got me thinking, what if we had a
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.340]  photo made, like a black and white, like
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:17.380]  90s comedy
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.220]  like store photo
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.220]  of the five of us together
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.440]  and then we could give them
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.320]  out to every restaurant in
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.480]  America. We could just start mailing them to restaurants
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.080]  with like nice phrases on it, like
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.260]  try the shakes, or like, can't
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.280]  beat their burger, right? And
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.220]  they could be available upon request. We could
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.260]  even give them to audience members if they wanted to
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.240]  then take them and deliver them to
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.300]  restaurants. And we could see two things.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.260]  One, we could see if we could grow organically
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.240]  by being in, by the way, once
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.380]  you get in a restaurant, you're there forever.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.120]  They're not, that thing's not going
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.160]  anywhere. It doesn't, it doesn't matter if
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.300]  you die or get canceled or anything
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.020]  once they hang a photo up in a restaurant,
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.960]  it's never coming down.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.220]  And then, two,
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:01.180]  maybe we could break some kind of a record to be
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.020]  like the celebrity, not that we're celebrities, but
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.160]  the podcast or the group with
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.080]  the most
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.160]  photos hanging in restaurants around
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.340]  the world. Do you think it's like
[01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:13.120]  the Hollywood Walk of Fame where they
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.180]  they're charging these celebrities for their hot dog
[01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.620]  buns to maintain the space?
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.100]  You have to pay a secret fee.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.300]  Dude, I wish I did, but I don't think so.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.220]  I mean, they'll
[01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:25.080]  probably charge us, but that's fine.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.240]  Oh, 100% we're getting charged for that.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:29.080]  We do not, based on merit or
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080]  there's no reason for us to be on this
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.100]  wall outside if we paid for a spot.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.120]  These are all the different ones I took while I was there.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.860]  Hall & Oates, Billy Joel.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.360]  Cut that one in half.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:39.760]  Willard Scott.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.140]  I don't know
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.380]  why I took a picture of AJ in Cronauer.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.980]  I think it was to show Emily's dad, maybe.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.500]  And then Kevin Costner. I took a picture of anybody
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.660]  that I thought was associated with our podcast in any way.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.780]  So have they written on the actual bun?
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.040]  Yeah, it looks like it.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.620]  And then the bun's been resined.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.000]  I guess so, yeah.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.740]  You think Hall & Oates
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.460]  recover from their beef
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.560]  at the hot dog bun being like, hey, remember
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.720]  the good times? And then they each put their hand
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.140]  on the bun and their friends get...
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.220]  You're left bun, I'm right bun. Let's be buns together.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.120]  Anyway, that's my idea.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.800]  We get a celebrity photo headshot
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.720]  thing made and then we just somehow
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.820]  put it in the hands of every restaurant in the world.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.220]  I think some would go up.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.860]  Guarantee some would go up.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.920]  I guarantee you there are people listening to this
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.760]  podcast right now that work at restaurants
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.600]  that are like, send it to me, I'll put it up tomorrow.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.300]  If we finally franchise that melting pot,
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.140]  we can put one up there.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:33.640]  Oh!
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:37.080]  This, uh,
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.420]  is, I think, the most
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.160]  concerned I've been at the start of
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.220]  a Geoff Ideata on board by the
[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.500]  end, I think I've ever been.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.880]  What was your original concern?
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.100]  I didn't... he posted
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.880]  a photo of Michael J. Fox
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.740]  that said, try the shakes on it,
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.100]  and I was worried what direction we were
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.580]  going in. I thought,
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:59.160]  we ran the possibility of it being
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.160]  a very tasteless joke.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.240]  Oh my god!
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.460]  I didn't even make the connection.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.520]  Are you serious?
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.920]  My brain immediately went there and went,
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.160]  what are we doing? I was immediately laughing
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.200]  at that because it's in a different pen like someone
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.460]  else wrote it on. No, I literally
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.900]  just googled
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:18.620]  here, I'll show you.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.360]  I just, oh my god.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.320]  I was terrified of like,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.740]  what are you doing?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.160]  I'm horrified now because that sounds terrible.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:28.300]  No, no, no, look here.
[01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:30.180]  And then it became clear that
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.160]  that is not at all what you were trying to
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.600]  reference.
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.480]  Okay, we're good.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:37.880]  I searched for
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.040]  celebrity autograph photo
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.800]  diner, and
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.580]  Michael J. Fox is the very first one.
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.500]  I just grabbed it because it was first. I had nothing to do with it.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.320]  I didn't make the connection either.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.160]  The joke didn't
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.980]  occur to me at all. I instantly looked at it and went,
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.420]  what are we doing?
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.060]  No, I had no idea. It must be generational or something
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.380]  because Eric and I didn't get there.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.580]  But you can see from my google search
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.960]  if you search celebrity
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.260]  autograph photo diner
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:05.060]  that's the photo.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.400]  Oh, god.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.240]  Damn, man.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.180]  I'm so glad that that was like a wholesome
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.160]  like, yeah, that's a fun, let's send
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:16.040]  diners buns. Could it
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.220]  be more wholesome? I don't want to send buns, just autograph
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.880]  photos. Could it be more wholesome?
[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:20.780]  Nothing biodegradable.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.580]  Love it.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:24.660]  That was a good ep.
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.560]  I almost cancelled myself
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.600]  in the last five minutes.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.640]  I was like
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.340]  what are we? Oh, boy.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.580]  I'm worried about
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.200]  this direction and then I was, yeah.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.260]  All good.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.660]  That was fun. Let's do, let's wrap this up
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.560]  and then record
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.740]  something else. We're recording a
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.120]  special video after this, right?
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:48.700]  Should we say what it is?
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.200]  Yeah, why wouldn't we? We're recording
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.220]  our first sausage talk.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:55.100]  First regulation sausage talk with
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.380]  questions submitted by
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.180]  members of the falcon tier of our
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.900]  Patreon. I would even
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.780]  I'd record another episode if we could.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.260]  I'm having fun. Yeah, you said
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:07.140]  you're a two a day guy this morning and then you
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.120]  disappeared. I, well, yeah, well, no
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.960]  I was just saying that
[01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:13.120]  you went back to sleep. No, I didn't. I was
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.200]  awake the whole time. I just, I said my
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.220]  statement. I didn't want to start a fight. I was a little
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.080]  gun shy after the ricochets from
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:20.620]  the last thing I said.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.160]  But what, but
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.180]  were you saying that because we're recording
[01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:27.220]  two today? No, I was saying that
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.540]  because I
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.100]  there is a level of fear going
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:33.220]  into these recordings that is like, oh man
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:35.200]  I really hope it's good. I'm really excited, but like
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.160]  I hope I deliver. And when
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.040]  we do two, we just
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.060]  deal with that all in one day and
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.140]  I don't like that I'm now going to have to do
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.160]  this again tomorrow. Like getting all your work done
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:46.300]  on a Monday sort of feeling?
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:47.340]  Yeah.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.180]  It's not even getting all my work done.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.400]  It's the work that I find I'm most nervous
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.220]  about. Like I really want this to be good
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.080]  and like I feel like I need to be on my game for
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.300]  and just stretch it out over
[01:05:58.300 --> 01:05:59.920]  two days. I think I prefer
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.860]  because I feel like I could do six right now.
[01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.480]  Do you not feel like you have the same
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.500]  feeling about video game content we make?
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.320]  Not at all, no. Oh, okay.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.480]  Because like the video game does a lot of the heavy lifting.
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.300]  Yeah, I feel like the video game is like
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.300]  it opens, I don't have to
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.320]  prep in the same way for it, like it will
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.380]  things will emerge from that that I can just react
[01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:20.060]  to. Where this is like
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:22.180]  I need to take notes and make sure of my images
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.440]  and... You can sit down at just about
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.640]  any video game situation completely blind
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.160]  and eek out a video pretty easily
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.420]  but this podcast is a whole different animal for me
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.320]  at least. I completely agree.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.320]  I've got so many notes
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.300]  I'm excited for the next one
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.700]  I got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.440]  Well, let's get to it.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.940]  Let's wrap up. Do you have a game?
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.780]  I have a game for us to play.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.460]  Oh, shit.
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.780]  That was great.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:49.200]  Alright, well
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.920]  somebody end it.
[01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:55.770]  This whole show
[01:06:55.770 --> 01:06:57.570]  I've been trying to figure out what this note means
[01:06:57.570 --> 01:06:59.890]  and it's my game. I just wrote it horribly.
[01:07:00.530 --> 01:07:01.570]  But I've been quietly
[01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:03.550]  looking at it like bog roll folders going
[01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:04.870]  what is this?
[01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:06.090]  What does this mean?
[01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.390]  You'll find out what it means next week
[01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:11.670]  on The Regulation Podcast's
[01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.850]  11th episode
[01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.490]  Tentatively titled
[01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.110]  This Is What This Means.
[01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:19.130]  Thanks for listening.

[01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:24.690]  You have to say it.
[01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:27.590]  It's the best domain I've ever registered in my life.
