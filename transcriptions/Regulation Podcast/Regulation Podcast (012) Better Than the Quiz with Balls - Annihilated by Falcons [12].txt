[00:00.640 --> 00:05.220]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:06.100 --> 00:10.320]  This is number 12, I believe, but it's not in the chat.
[00:10.440 --> 00:12.000]  So let me scroll up.
[00:12.260 --> 00:14.760]  It is number 12 right there. It's in twice.
[00:14.880 --> 00:17.080]  We're double covered. Excellent. Great job, everybody.
[00:17.360 --> 00:20.540]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free,
[00:21.900 --> 00:25.280]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour, this time in Inside Out order.
[00:26.620 --> 00:27.740]  How's everybody doing?
[00:27.740 --> 00:29.480]  Dozen in the bag.
[00:30.640 --> 00:32.340]  What? I don't. What?
[00:32.800 --> 00:34.640]  Dozen episodes. Not yet.
[00:34.700 --> 00:37.300]  Oh, well, this isn't in the bag yet.
[00:37.340 --> 00:38.720]  We haven't completed this right now.
[00:38.760 --> 00:41.380]  We're still looking for the bag. We're still bagging.
[00:41.780 --> 00:43.020]  We're still bagging. We're close.
[00:43.280 --> 00:45.960]  We're we're almost ready to put the metal bread tie on.
[00:46.520 --> 00:48.260]  Bread is next week. That'll be the baker's dozen.
[00:48.960 --> 00:51.480]  Oh, how much is a baker's dozen?
[00:52.500 --> 00:52.800]  Thirteen.
[00:53.740 --> 00:55.500]  Why do the bakers got to be special?
[00:57.180 --> 00:59.620]  Why can't they just live by everyone else's dozen?
[00:59.640 --> 01:00.540]  You think it should be a plumber's dozen?
[01:01.080 --> 01:03.800]  It's a good thing. They're giving you an extra with everything.
[01:03.980 --> 01:05.320]  It's like saying breakers are good people.
[01:05.380 --> 01:07.060]  They're giving you, you know, giving you a hook up.
[01:08.740 --> 01:09.780]  Who's giving me what?
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.620]  Bakers, they give you it.
[01:13.520 --> 01:16.260]  Something's happened to Andrew's comprehension ability, I think.
[01:16.560 --> 01:20.540]  No, I'm good. Oh, I heard bakers.
[01:21.340 --> 01:23.380]  All right. I didn't. Go ahead.
[01:23.790 --> 01:26.440]  No, it's been a long day already.
[01:26.580 --> 01:30.480]  Audience, you don't know this, but we recorded an Olympic thing this morning
[01:30.480 --> 01:34.680]  that I felt like I ran a marathon halfway through it.
[01:35.080 --> 01:38.580]  I feel like we deserved some of us deserve gold medals just for making it through.
[01:38.760 --> 01:43.240]  And then we recorded a very high energy Let's Play and then took a break.
[01:43.280 --> 01:47.600]  And then now we're back to to hit it hard on this episode of The Rating Show Podcast.
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.820]  Hard and hard.
[01:52.280 --> 01:54.820]  It's been just immediately quiet.
[01:54.820 --> 01:57.220]  Like what happened? Hard.
[01:57.560 --> 02:01.100]  I think it's been a real feisty couple of weeks because we've had
[02:01.620 --> 02:02.980]  a lot of arguments.
[02:03.580 --> 02:07.160]  The drinks draft came out and the winner,
[02:07.420 --> 02:09.520]  the community have gone a certain way with it.
[02:09.580 --> 02:10.720]  I don't know if I agree with it.
[02:12.740 --> 02:16.180]  We actually had a big argument about it again yesterday in.
[02:16.480 --> 02:18.180]  Really? Yeah. Last of us.
[02:18.180 --> 02:21.740]  Oh, if you want my original reaction to the Alex,
[02:21.960 --> 02:23.680]  that was everyone's response to the drinks draft.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.720]  Check out Nick's last of us stream VOD.
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.440]  What was surprising to me wasn't just that people sided with Nick.
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.620]  Were the people saying that you were wrong for drafting the way you did?
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.160]  That's what I thought was hilarious.
[02:38.680 --> 02:40.720]  I don't I don't want to get into it again.
[02:41.020 --> 02:43.900]  It is. Now, I think that's probably it's a draft.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.360]  There's a pool of things to pick. That's right.
[02:46.980 --> 02:47.980]  Here's the thing, Gavin.
[02:47.980 --> 02:50.220]  I think that you're right. I think your draft was good.
[02:50.280 --> 02:51.380]  I think you did a great job.
[02:51.560 --> 02:57.480]  I also think that you are battling against years
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.720]  of what the community thinks it feels about you.
[03:00.960 --> 03:07.120]  And so you are really having to fight your way uphill on something like that.
[03:07.380 --> 03:09.480]  So I don't say it. I don't deserve it.
[03:09.520 --> 03:11.360]  I'm just saying I don't agree with it.
[03:13.780 --> 03:15.380]  I think you don't deserve it.
[03:15.440 --> 03:17.820]  But I think, OK, I mean, either way, I guess.
[03:17.980 --> 03:18.800]  They're different.
[03:20.180 --> 03:21.840]  It's there was there was a lot of.
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.340]  They're different.
[03:24.460 --> 03:26.480]  Well, picking coffee is like picking soda.
[03:26.780 --> 03:28.960]  No, it isn't. No, it isn't.
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.920]  All right. Because coffee is a thing that grows.
[03:33.040 --> 03:33.940]  It's a bean.
[03:34.920 --> 03:36.160]  Soda isn't a thing.
[03:36.260 --> 03:38.920]  Are you saying it's like I'm not saying carbon dioxide.
[03:39.580 --> 03:41.420]  Soda is just a way of having something.
[03:42.900 --> 03:44.720]  Yeah, I agree with you there.
[03:44.940 --> 03:45.380]  It's fizzy.
[03:45.820 --> 03:47.320]  Yeah. When when people were like,
[03:47.320 --> 03:48.680]  well, what if Andrew drafted soda?
[03:48.800 --> 03:52.140]  And it's like, I think we were pretty specific about how you couldn't do that.
[03:52.180 --> 03:53.340]  And we had to get specific there.
[03:53.460 --> 03:54.500]  And then the coffee thing happened.
[03:54.600 --> 03:55.680]  And then here we are.
[03:55.760 --> 03:57.160]  You know, I'm over it.
[03:57.180 --> 03:58.300]  I'm over it. Yeah, I can tell.
[03:58.400 --> 04:00.440]  I can tell by the way you're saying I'm over it.
[04:00.540 --> 04:01.780]  You're definitely over it.
[04:01.940 --> 04:04.880]  You are definitely not going to be over it any time soon.
[04:05.260 --> 04:08.040]  I got a game, Gavin, if it might make you feel better.
[04:08.200 --> 04:09.480]  You want to turn things around.
[04:09.560 --> 04:11.660]  I got a little I'm going to guess the coffee.
[04:12.780 --> 04:14.140]  It's a guessing game.
[04:14.180 --> 04:15.240]  It isn't guess the coffee.
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.140]  Not a great audible game.
[04:17.200 --> 04:18.140]  Very visual.
[04:18.620 --> 04:23.020]  But inspired by a game that you made, Gavin, you gave me a lot of sass.
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.120]  This is a game that you made a spinoff of it.
[04:25.500 --> 04:27.840]  We tried to determine how
[04:28.960 --> 04:32.040]  how well a person could be detected by their teeth,
[04:32.300 --> 04:34.620]  how known they could be, how recognizable.
[04:35.940 --> 04:39.680]  And I wanted to expand on that idea because we did terrible.
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.240]  We did not do well.
[04:42.060 --> 04:43.820]  I'm pretty sure everyone was right.
[04:43.820 --> 04:45.540]  I think I got everyone right.
[04:45.960 --> 04:47.200]  Oh, I didn't really.
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.000]  Why do you think we didn't do well?
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.260]  Is that just like an assumption?
[04:51.060 --> 04:52.060]  What did you do?
[04:52.200 --> 04:53.520]  What have you done with Andrew?
[04:53.660 --> 04:54.740]  And can we have him back?
[04:55.140 --> 04:56.340]  Are you OK?
[04:56.720 --> 04:57.880]  Did you sleep last night?
[04:58.520 --> 04:59.860]  I slept too well.
[05:00.080 --> 05:01.420]  Maybe. Maybe that's the problem.
[05:02.620 --> 05:05.760]  I woke up today and yeah, it was a great sleep.
[05:06.180 --> 05:09.160]  Anyway, maybe we'll do worse than with this one.
[05:09.240 --> 05:10.140]  It's still a game.
[05:11.060 --> 05:12.220]  It's still playable.
[05:12.800 --> 05:14.440]  We did teeth before.
[05:14.800 --> 05:18.100]  People say eyes, the vessel to the soul or whatever.
[05:18.260 --> 05:19.460]  I got some eyes.
[05:19.600 --> 05:24.500]  I got some famous eyes for you guys to see if you can recognize famous soul vessels.
[05:24.920 --> 05:27.000]  Do you think that's the phrase?
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.780]  Who these eyes be?
[05:31.120 --> 05:31.560]  That's Geoff.
[05:32.840 --> 05:34.000]  Yeah, that's absolutely Geoff.
[05:34.940 --> 05:36.100]  No. Yeah. Yeah.
[05:36.100 --> 05:36.800]  Geoff is famous.
[05:37.400 --> 05:38.520]  No, not Geoff.
[05:38.540 --> 05:39.200]  Yeah, he's been on.
[05:39.240 --> 05:41.860]  He's been on shows like people know who he is.
[05:41.860 --> 05:42.880]  They ask him for autographs.
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.660]  Are you saying these aren't us?
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.280]  They are not us.
[05:46.420 --> 05:47.120]  Oh, oh.
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.420]  Remy Malek.
[05:49.060 --> 05:50.780]  Whoo. OK.
[05:51.720 --> 05:52.880]  It's not Remy Malek.
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.380]  These are celebrity eyes.
[05:56.020 --> 05:56.860]  Celebrity eyes.
[05:57.240 --> 05:59.900]  I reckon Jake Gyllenhaal.
[06:00.660 --> 06:01.300]  Oh, wow.
[06:01.360 --> 06:04.120]  You think Remy Malek and Jake Gyllenhaal have similar eyes?
[06:04.940 --> 06:06.060]  Steve Buscemi.
[06:06.700 --> 06:08.760]  I like that guess a lot.
[06:09.980 --> 06:10.660]  Pauly Shore.
[06:11.300 --> 06:12.960]  I like that as well.
[06:13.260 --> 06:14.460]  Nobody's close.
[06:16.440 --> 06:18.840]  That's OK, because there are layers to this game.
[06:19.000 --> 06:19.660]  Oh, God.
[06:20.160 --> 06:21.920]  What? You haven't been able to figure out via the eyes.
[06:22.080 --> 06:24.560]  Let's pop in another facial feature.
[06:26.980 --> 06:29.440]  You got some lips to deal with now as well.
[06:29.520 --> 06:31.080]  You got eyes and you got some mouth.
[06:31.560 --> 06:33.220]  Oh, Vin Diesel.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.820]  I can see it.
[06:36.080 --> 06:37.580]  I didn't know I could see it.
[06:37.620 --> 06:38.220]  But you're right.
[06:38.500 --> 06:40.020]  It doesn't look like Vin Diesel.
[06:40.020 --> 06:43.040]  It's not this particular image.
[06:43.040 --> 06:46.680]  Looks like the worst Sonic the Hedgehog you could come up with.
[06:48.180 --> 06:51.460]  I would argue that this is the best Sonic the Hedgehog.
[06:51.540 --> 06:53.340]  Did you by any chance scribble?
[06:53.460 --> 06:55.620]  Why are the eyes cut out in two different ways?
[06:55.760 --> 06:57.020]  Yeah, that's what I hate.
[06:57.080 --> 06:58.980]  I was about to say, why did you do that?
[06:59.820 --> 07:01.100]  They're in different places.
[07:02.120 --> 07:04.740]  Because I would I took the base photo
[07:05.300 --> 07:08.100]  and then I would go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[07:08.100 --> 07:09.280]  and I'd make it all blue.
[07:09.840 --> 07:12.600]  You didn't just work backwards and just like remove the face?
[07:12.840 --> 07:13.420]  He did not.
[07:13.840 --> 07:15.180]  No, I did it every time.
[07:15.340 --> 07:18.280]  I did. He did the eyes and then he came up with this next idea.
[07:19.320 --> 07:20.660]  He started from scratch.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.260]  Every every one of these.
[07:22.400 --> 07:26.780]  So for those who can't see what we're talking about, it looks like by hand
[07:26.780 --> 07:31.840]  he scribbled over the entire rest of the face instead of just cutting the eyes out.
[07:32.200 --> 07:33.420]  Yeah. Mm hmm.
[07:35.300 --> 07:36.240]  I don't know.
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.580]  Do we have Andrew, do we have more features to see?
[07:38.800 --> 07:40.240]  I don't I don't really have a sure do.
[07:40.860 --> 07:44.440]  Last but not least, we're getting the nose in there as well.
[07:46.180 --> 07:47.720]  Yeah, this is the guy from Dexter.
[07:48.840 --> 07:52.080]  No, no, I really thought you guys would get this one.
[07:52.140 --> 07:53.280]  I feel like this is the easiest.
[07:53.400 --> 07:54.440]  Is that Jensen Ackles?
[07:55.100 --> 07:56.060]  That's not even close.
[07:56.580 --> 07:56.940]  That's a strong nose.
[07:57.580 --> 07:58.200]  I have no idea.
[07:58.380 --> 08:00.180]  Not. Is it the rock? Close.
[08:00.760 --> 08:05.920]  No, it's cut out in such a weird way as to disguise too much
[08:05.920 --> 08:07.640]  and differently each time.
[08:08.040 --> 08:09.640]  Yeah, the top of that, it looks like a shirt.
[08:10.140 --> 08:12.360]  Differently each time is fucking me up.
[08:12.420 --> 08:13.240]  Yeah, me too.
[08:13.860 --> 08:15.540]  Yeah. In like a big way.
[08:15.600 --> 08:16.740]  And like a really big way.
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.720]  OK, well, it doesn't seem like we have much success, so let's flip this game on its head.
[08:22.860 --> 08:25.580]  Now I'm going to present the celebrity
[08:26.240 --> 08:28.120]  with only their features covered.
[08:28.580 --> 08:29.300]  Nothing else covered.
[08:29.800 --> 08:30.220]  What?
[08:31.440 --> 08:33.360]  The reverse of what we've been doing.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.580]  It's Verne Troyer?
[08:34.960 --> 08:36.320]  Verne Troyer!
[08:36.560 --> 08:38.200]  Dude, I don't see... Go back up.
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.980]  Scroll back up and look at those images.
[08:40.360 --> 08:41.980]  None of them look like Verne Troyer, dude.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.080]  Even knowing that it's Verne Troyer, it doesn't at all look like him.
[08:45.360 --> 08:45.960]  No. At all.
[08:46.400 --> 08:46.840]  Absolutely.
[08:47.000 --> 08:47.500]  At all.
[08:47.940 --> 08:49.800]  No. No, not at all.
[08:49.820 --> 08:51.640]  That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
[08:53.040 --> 08:55.940]  That last... Geoff, can that be the thumbnail of this last picture?
[08:56.280 --> 08:57.240]  It might. Yeah.
[08:57.380 --> 09:01.620]  It might give up too much, but boy, it's a really haunting photo.
[09:02.180 --> 09:03.800]  Please tell me you've got more of these.
[09:04.260 --> 09:05.920]  Oh yeah, I do. Absolutely, I do.
[09:06.360 --> 09:09.600]  I haven't seen the movie Long Legs, but I assume it's like
[09:09.600 --> 09:13.260]  what that last Verne Troyer photo is where you've just scribbled over parts of it.
[09:13.300 --> 09:13.980]  Oh my God.
[09:14.100 --> 09:15.840]  This is better than the quiz with balls.
[09:16.680 --> 09:18.940]  This is even better than the quiz with balls.
[09:19.420 --> 09:20.080]  Yep. Okay.
[09:20.420 --> 09:21.260]  Here's the next one.
[09:21.900 --> 09:23.480]  Apologize for our audio listening.
[09:23.580 --> 09:26.000]  You might want to watch the video of this if you want to play along.
[09:26.700 --> 09:27.400]  It's on YouTube.
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.980]  Next set of celebrity eyes.
[09:29.980 --> 09:30.740]  Regulatrion.
[09:31.940 --> 09:32.140]  Oh.
[09:35.240 --> 09:36.840]  Is it Richard from Lost?
[09:37.960 --> 09:39.500]  No, it's not Richard from Lost.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.920]  No, they're not. They're not full enough.
[09:41.640 --> 09:42.680]  The eyelashes aren't full enough.
[09:42.700 --> 09:43.560]  That's a great guess, though.
[09:43.860 --> 09:45.840]  Yeah, yeah, I like I like where you're thinking.
[09:46.100 --> 09:47.240]  I like I like where your head's at.
[09:47.600 --> 09:48.880]  Is it Saeed from Lost?
[09:49.660 --> 09:50.020]  Nope.
[09:51.480 --> 09:52.540]  Jack from Lost.
[09:53.360 --> 09:54.840]  No, it was not on Lost.
[09:55.220 --> 09:56.400]  Okay. Are you sure?
[09:56.760 --> 09:57.760]  Are they in Star Wars?
[09:58.180 --> 10:00.280]  It looks like the Death Star in their eyes in the reflection.
[10:00.780 --> 10:02.900]  I don't think they were in Star Wars.
[10:03.040 --> 10:05.800]  But if you would told if you would tell me that they were.
[10:06.240 --> 10:07.900]  OK, sure. I can see it.
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.620]  I think this is going to be a reveal to a picture that has the face
[10:11.620 --> 10:12.700]  covered anyway, like Zorro.
[10:13.260 --> 10:15.320]  Yeah. Now here's what I'll say.
[10:15.720 --> 10:19.460]  I can't wait to see what is covered up differently in the next photo.
[10:19.540 --> 10:20.880]  So why don't we go ahead and see the nose?
[10:21.260 --> 10:27.140]  OK, let's see the we're going to include the nose in one second.
[10:27.140 --> 10:27.980]  I'm just I was.
[10:29.360 --> 10:30.820]  Uh, well, no, we're not including those.
[10:30.940 --> 10:32.440]  We're doing lips. Lips next.
[10:32.920 --> 10:34.560]  Oh, sorry. Right. Yeah. Lips.
[10:35.000 --> 10:35.880]  Lips next order.
[10:36.040 --> 10:38.140]  He scribbled it all wrong and different again.
[10:38.500 --> 10:40.700]  This is the eyes are so different.
[10:42.420 --> 10:44.700]  His right eye looks like a puzzle piece.
[10:45.500 --> 10:46.320]  Same eyes.
[10:47.720 --> 10:49.280]  Is this a movie star?
[10:49.760 --> 10:50.640]  It's a movie star.
[10:50.820 --> 10:52.120]  Is that Felicity Jones?
[10:52.860 --> 10:53.860]  No, it's a man.
[10:54.280 --> 10:55.100]  Oh, it's a man. Sweet.
[10:55.400 --> 10:56.260]  It's a man.
[10:56.260 --> 10:57.600]  It's a Denzel Washington.
[10:58.340 --> 11:02.200]  No, I think he's too white for that white man.
[11:02.720 --> 11:06.520]  Yeah. Why don't why don't we check out the nose and we can really
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.920]  you guys don't get the nose.
[11:08.020 --> 11:08.820]  Then you have no hope.
[11:08.900 --> 11:10.520]  I feel like the nose gives away a lot, Andrew.
[11:10.660 --> 11:14.260]  I have I have to have you know that how bad this is.
[11:14.280 --> 11:15.040]  Oh, it's Matthew McConaughey.
[11:15.240 --> 11:18.120]  That this now see how.
[11:19.220 --> 11:21.560]  See how this is like a great cut out of him,
[11:21.580 --> 11:23.320]  but it also makes him look like a superhero.
[11:23.640 --> 11:25.440]  OK, Jesus fucking Christ.
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.040]  Hey, hey, Geoff, I think he made an angel with the wings.
[11:29.580 --> 11:31.420]  Verne Troy was a T-shirt. This is an angel.
[11:31.900 --> 11:33.300]  Yeah, Geoff, I take back what I said.
[11:33.380 --> 11:35.840]  Can this Matthew McConaughey picture be the thumbnail?
[11:36.060 --> 11:37.340]  I think that's our thumbnail.
[11:37.640 --> 11:39.540]  Yeah, yeah. Fucking insane.
[11:40.660 --> 11:42.000]  I got one more.
[11:42.500 --> 11:44.420]  Oh, I love it. Please. I love it.
[11:44.800 --> 11:45.860]  Wrap this game up.
[11:45.940 --> 11:48.280]  Sorry, audio only listeners, you should really.
[11:49.280 --> 11:51.480]  Pop it in. Check out the Instagram.
[11:51.680 --> 11:52.560]  I'll have I'll post it all.
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.440]  OK, here we go.
[11:54.440 --> 11:55.960]  Here's the first. The eyes.
[11:57.120 --> 11:58.200]  Who's that celebrity?
[11:58.880 --> 12:01.500]  The eyes have it. Oh, oh,
[12:02.740 --> 12:05.580]  Jesse Plemons. Wow.
[12:08.480 --> 12:11.580]  Um, this is is this oh, um.
[12:12.860 --> 12:13.860]  Is this a movie star?
[12:14.480 --> 12:15.540]  They're all movie stars.
[12:15.980 --> 12:17.440]  OK, Ryan Reynolds.
[12:18.420 --> 12:21.240]  No. Is it Bradley Cooper?
[12:22.080 --> 12:23.460]  No. Fuck.
[12:24.400 --> 12:26.740]  All of these people have been in the same movie together.
[12:27.380 --> 12:29.060]  What? Oh, they have. OK.
[12:29.860 --> 12:31.080]  Let's see the next.
[12:31.640 --> 12:32.860]  Let's see the lips, I guess.
[12:33.320 --> 12:34.220]  You want to see them lips?
[12:34.800 --> 12:35.600]  Let's show me them.
[12:35.700 --> 12:36.940]  Show me the lips. What them lips do?
[12:37.500 --> 12:38.420]  What them lips do?
[12:39.780 --> 12:40.840]  What the fuck?
[12:41.600 --> 12:43.220]  Gavin, did this help you at all?
[12:43.880 --> 12:44.940]  Matt, Jesse Plemons.
[12:45.480 --> 12:47.300]  I it's so clear to me.
[12:47.520 --> 12:49.300]  I can see it very clear.
[12:49.340 --> 12:50.280]  You put it together.
[12:50.280 --> 12:51.060]  Of course, you see.
[12:53.880 --> 12:56.420]  It's not Jesse Plemons, you're really hung up on Jesse Plemons.
[12:56.880 --> 12:58.340]  I love seeing it's the Plemmeister.
[12:58.720 --> 12:59.500]  Leonardo DiCaprio.
[12:59.680 --> 13:00.600]  It's Leonardo DiCaprio.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.620]  Eric's got it. Yeah.
[13:02.680 --> 13:04.040]  He can see them lips.
[13:04.660 --> 13:07.900]  If you squint and look at it sideways and then he said,
[13:07.960 --> 13:10.840]  all these people are in a mood like Matthew McConaughey
[13:10.840 --> 13:13.900]  and Leonardo DiCaprio on Wolf of Wall Street, right?
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.500]  Like that's that's where your head was.
[13:16.420 --> 13:19.980]  Uh, I just said that to be like, create a fun fact
[13:19.980 --> 13:20.660]  that wasn't real.
[13:20.820 --> 13:23.080]  I just because Troyer, I don't think has been in anything.
[13:23.740 --> 13:26.120]  Oh, so that was that's the only reason I guess Leonardo DiCaprio.
[13:26.720 --> 13:27.500]  That's great.
[13:28.860 --> 13:30.200]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[13:30.720 --> 13:31.680]  Yeah. Easy.
[13:31.720 --> 13:33.120]  Yeah, it's clearly. Yeah. Yeah.
[13:34.160 --> 13:36.140]  Now, let's see his face cut out.
[13:36.820 --> 13:38.940]  Yeah, let me I just got to save these images.
[13:39.760 --> 13:41.180]  Are you scribbling on the fly?
[13:41.680 --> 13:42.560]  Wait, what do you know?
[13:43.220 --> 13:45.140]  It's a well, I I'm using Gavin.
[13:45.280 --> 13:46.360]  The phone Gavin sent me.
[13:46.440 --> 13:48.860]  So when I did this, it was on the UbiDigi bison.
[13:50.680 --> 13:52.820]  Did you 3D scan your head yet?
[13:53.360 --> 13:53.920]  No, not yet.
[13:54.340 --> 13:56.000]  No, he doesn't. Does he have an app for it?
[13:56.400 --> 13:57.000]  Oh, that's scary.
[13:57.340 --> 13:58.100]  Download the app. Yeah.
[13:58.260 --> 13:59.640]  Look at him. He's all grumpy.
[14:00.640 --> 14:04.500]  Andrew, your celebrity game of features is fantastic.
[14:04.760 --> 14:06.320]  This is a great game for everyone.
[14:06.460 --> 14:07.680]  We'll do more. Yeah.
[14:08.180 --> 14:10.300]  Yeah. I was a fan of it.
[14:10.400 --> 14:11.040]  I liked it.
[14:12.340 --> 14:13.420]  How do you feel now, Gavin?
[14:13.460 --> 14:13.900]  Do you feel better?
[14:15.880 --> 14:16.680]  Oh, yeah.
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.260]  Do I? There we go.
[14:18.620 --> 14:19.100]  Look at that.
[14:19.100 --> 14:19.900]  That was the goal.
[14:20.140 --> 14:21.180]  That's what I was hoping for.
[14:21.820 --> 14:22.080]  Great game.
[14:22.440 --> 14:23.380]  How's everybody else doing?
[14:23.980 --> 14:24.900]  You guys saw Twisters.
[14:25.380 --> 14:26.280]  You gave me some money.
[14:27.320 --> 14:28.120]  Jesus Christ.
[14:28.480 --> 14:29.740]  Why do you all hate Twisters?
[14:30.020 --> 14:32.120]  There are some people I know who said Twisters was like fun.
[14:32.200 --> 14:32.600]  It was good.
[14:33.040 --> 14:33.660]  No, they didn't.
[14:34.260 --> 14:34.460]  Yeah.
[14:34.980 --> 14:36.680]  Are they people that you respect?
[14:37.100 --> 14:37.620]  Not anymore.
[14:38.120 --> 14:40.240]  Yeah, I think it was a giant spinning piece of turd.
[14:40.460 --> 14:41.940]  Well, one is my wife.
[14:43.180 --> 14:44.080]  She liked that movie.
[14:44.460 --> 14:45.300]  Yeah. Can you believe that?
[14:45.580 --> 14:46.220]  Oh, my Lord.
[14:46.340 --> 14:47.200]  Did she like the original?
[14:48.020 --> 14:49.140]  Yeah, she loves the original.
[14:49.600 --> 14:51.780]  Yeah, there's no way you can love the original and then love that.
[14:52.240 --> 14:52.680]  What I said.
[14:53.280 --> 14:57.740]  It was so offensively bad in so many ways.
[14:58.320 --> 15:00.620]  I can't believe that there's no kiss.
[15:00.860 --> 15:04.200]  There's no physical touch in that movie.
[15:05.020 --> 15:05.840]  It's crazy.
[15:06.340 --> 15:10.140]  Their best friend, who's the guy from the Jim Beam commercials,
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.300]  joins the military, is in for five years
[15:14.300 --> 15:17.160]  and leaves with government prototype
[15:17.700 --> 15:22.600]  satellite imaging technology that he gets to keep.
[15:22.760 --> 15:26.140]  I was also in the army for exactly five years.
[15:26.540 --> 15:27.540]  I got a blanket.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.240]  I got to keep a blanket and some old clothes.
[15:31.480 --> 15:34.340]  That is such fucking bullshit.
[15:35.020 --> 15:39.000]  I don't see what your inability to get stuff has to do with him.
[15:39.560 --> 15:41.040]  That sounds like a you problem.
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.460]  Yeah, the CG is now the point where you can make weather look flawless,
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.380]  like it can be as realistic as you want.
[15:47.520 --> 15:50.140]  And I don't know how it looked worse than the original.
[15:50.560 --> 15:51.640]  I feel the same way.
[15:52.020 --> 15:57.140]  Also, the whole idea that we're going to take pictures of it from the outside
[15:57.140 --> 16:00.400]  and that's going to be better than the thing we did in the last movie
[16:00.400 --> 16:04.620]  where we just put a thousand balls inside it and map the entirety
[16:04.620 --> 16:05.320]  of the fucking thing.
[16:05.580 --> 16:08.520]  Like the premise from the get go was like, oh, well, that's stupid.
[16:08.620 --> 16:09.940]  They already did this better in the first movie.
[16:09.940 --> 16:10.940]  That's not an improvement.
[16:11.380 --> 16:13.680]  We're going to bullet time it like it's the Matrix.
[16:13.960 --> 16:17.760]  It only referenced the original movie by negating all of their work.
[16:17.880 --> 16:18.700]  Yes. Correct.
[16:19.580 --> 16:25.020]  My my knock on it isn't even the like, here's what was presented.
[16:25.180 --> 16:26.200]  Isn't this a bad movie?
[16:26.300 --> 16:29.420]  It's a summer blockbuster, and I'm not trying to like hold out much hope
[16:29.420 --> 16:33.440]  for it being like spectacular or really even competent.
[16:33.560 --> 16:38.040]  But the fact that there are so many missing parts in it and it's missing
[16:38.680 --> 16:44.460]  the thing you remember from Twister is the cow flying and them tying to the pole
[16:44.460 --> 16:46.520]  like the the pipes or whatever.
[16:46.900 --> 16:51.900]  Nobody leaves the ground in this movie like a like.
[16:52.080 --> 16:54.320]  Well, her boyfriend does.
[16:54.680 --> 16:57.020]  Yeah, it's just people.
[16:57.560 --> 16:58.840]  At the very beginning, it happens.
[16:58.940 --> 17:01.600]  And then every and then the rest of the movie is spent inside of cars
[17:01.600 --> 17:05.400]  and everyone's racing to get to a Twister first for whatever reason.
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.920]  Uh, the the my problem with it is that there's no memorable action
[17:09.920 --> 17:11.200]  through like the whole thing.
[17:11.220 --> 17:15.640]  And also, I've talked ad nauseum about with Gavin and Geoff about this.
[17:15.960 --> 17:20.220]  The fact that there's no dog in this movie is like fucking insane.
[17:20.440 --> 17:21.920]  I mean, they were looking for it crazy.
[17:22.420 --> 17:28.140]  It's crazy that there's not a dog that hangs out with Glenn Powell
[17:28.140 --> 17:31.720]  that has like a little scarf and then he's like buddies
[17:31.720 --> 17:34.540]  with the people in the Winnebago thing like that.
[17:34.540 --> 17:38.340]  That dog, Eric, you're not only are you right.
[17:38.440 --> 17:41.440]  That dog, the absence of that dog cost him $40 million.
[17:41.940 --> 17:43.320]  That's a $40 million dog.
[17:43.640 --> 17:45.080]  Yeah, I think people you could have sold.
[17:45.180 --> 17:46.460]  You could have sold the dog plush.
[17:46.620 --> 17:48.540]  People would have talked about the funny dog.
[17:48.880 --> 17:49.420]  It would've been great.
[17:50.040 --> 17:55.260]  Replace the messy drone pilot with a dog and let the dog fly the drone.
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.760]  Uh-huh. Yeah, that's 60 million right there.
[17:57.980 --> 17:59.340]  Give the dogs something to do. 60 million.
[17:59.880 --> 18:03.420]  They just at no point could figure out the rules of their own Twisters.
[18:03.420 --> 18:04.460]  They they could.
[18:04.840 --> 18:08.060]  It was so arbitrary at what range from the Twister
[18:08.060 --> 18:09.820]  something would get picked up and sucked up.
[18:09.900 --> 18:11.020]  It was whatever they decided.
[18:11.100 --> 18:12.320]  It made absolutely no sense.
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.600]  Mm hmm. So that's Twisters.
[18:14.940 --> 18:19.300]  And when they and when when he's driving and he's like, here's what we're doing.
[18:19.640 --> 18:21.700]  The scarecrow goes over here, the tin man.
[18:21.780 --> 18:25.480]  And he had like a pre-rendered visualization of that on his car
[18:25.480 --> 18:28.380]  about what was happening. Mental.
[18:29.100 --> 18:32.900]  Also, they spend the whole movie racing to get to a tornado
[18:32.900 --> 18:37.700]  that winning that race doesn't matter at any point to what they're trying to do.
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.280]  They just need to get there.
[18:40.300 --> 18:42.380]  I think they're always like trying to run each other off the road
[18:42.380 --> 18:43.720]  when they're getting to the same place.
[18:43.800 --> 18:45.000]  You'd be like, no, we got to get there first.
[18:45.040 --> 18:46.280]  It's like, so why?
[18:46.680 --> 18:49.580]  You both get into the same fucking place and you're not leaving immediately.
[18:49.660 --> 18:51.260]  You're going to be there for an hour until you die.
[18:51.340 --> 18:53.060]  You might as well like there's no fucking hurry.
[18:53.560 --> 18:57.700]  I like to sometimes picture what would happen during the credits,
[18:57.780 --> 18:59.720]  like if if the filming continued.
[19:01.180 --> 19:03.980]  After a movie, and I think all that would happen in this one
[19:03.980 --> 19:06.540]  is that Glenn Powell would be taken away in handcuffs.
[19:08.520 --> 19:12.080]  So just fully committing a felony, I assume, right at the end there.
[19:14.380 --> 19:15.700]  Really, really just.
[19:16.260 --> 19:20.200]  I mean, Paul Scheer, great cameo from from Human Giant.
[19:20.480 --> 19:22.560]  And how did this get made and everything else?
[19:22.580 --> 19:23.680]  A big Paul Scheer fan.
[19:24.200 --> 19:26.280]  And he's he keeps telling him to move his car.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.720]  And I don't know why that's him.
[19:27.820 --> 19:29.120]  I don't know why he's in that movie.
[19:29.120 --> 19:30.640]  Really bizarre cameo.
[19:30.740 --> 19:34.800]  Really? And honestly, the only cameo in like the whole movie.
[19:35.220 --> 19:38.120]  That's when you find out that like one of the producers is his brother
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.400]  in law or something, you know?
[19:39.420 --> 19:39.740]  Oh, yeah.
[19:39.840 --> 19:43.260]  And I asked him to be in it and he's like, yeah, it's definitely a guy
[19:43.260 --> 19:46.060]  who's just like a fan was just like, you want to be in this? OK.
[19:46.540 --> 19:47.460]  His bit did make me laugh.
[19:47.540 --> 19:49.320]  Well, he's in it because his mom was right.
[19:50.860 --> 19:51.820]  Is that the whole thing with him?
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.080]  You didn't see that thing of like his mom was a background extra
[19:56.080 --> 19:58.620]  in the first one and she was pregnant with him.
[19:58.620 --> 20:01.020]  Oh, are you serious?
[20:01.320 --> 20:04.200]  How would she be pregnant with him in 1994 or whatever?
[20:04.440 --> 20:05.600]  Yeah. What are you talking about?
[20:06.780 --> 20:07.740]  I don't listen.
[20:07.860 --> 20:09.120]  I just the tick tock or whatever.
[20:09.260 --> 20:11.860]  I don't know. Is Paul Scheer only 24?
[20:13.020 --> 20:15.580]  Hey, hey, Paul Scheer, if you're listening to this,
[20:15.800 --> 20:18.080]  you look awful for like 24 years old.
[20:18.240 --> 20:21.320]  Yeah, you look great for any age older than that.
[20:21.400 --> 20:23.000]  But if you are 24, I'm sorry.
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.860]  Life has been cruel.
[20:25.860 --> 20:32.150]  Oh, man.
[20:32.330 --> 20:37.870]  If you are a regulation podcast listener, a regulation listener, if you will,
[20:37.910 --> 20:42.230]  or even a comment leaver, then you know how important e-commerce
[20:42.230 --> 20:47.330]  and merchandise is to what we do and are planning on doing going forward.
[20:47.450 --> 20:52.810]  The previous podcast merch was a huge part of the podcast itself.
[20:52.910 --> 20:55.770]  It's it became a part of the fabric of the jokes.
[20:55.770 --> 21:00.790]  And we were only able to deliver that merchandise to our audience via Shopify.
[21:01.670 --> 21:04.490]  It ran the Rooster Teeth store.
[21:04.770 --> 21:09.990]  It ran the previous podcast store, and it did a heck of a job of it.
[21:10.230 --> 21:13.210]  And that's because it is the global e-commerce platform
[21:13.210 --> 21:15.410]  that helps you sell at every stage of your business.
[21:15.790 --> 21:18.910]  Whether you're a Rooster Teeth or a Clutch My Pearls,
[21:19.330 --> 21:23.410]  from a we sell one sticker to we have a thousand different SKUs
[21:23.410 --> 21:27.350]  in our product inventory, it is there to help you grow.
[21:27.730 --> 21:31.150]  Whether you are selling scented soap or offering outdoor outfits
[21:31.150 --> 21:36.090]  or selling slop o'clocks or selling kitchen fridge magnets or selling bat knobs,
[21:36.430 --> 21:38.330]  Shopify is the way to go.
[21:38.650 --> 21:42.050]  They help you turn browsers into buyers with the Internet's best converted
[21:42.050 --> 21:46.150]  checkout up to 36 percent better compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[21:46.590 --> 21:48.990]  And if you know anything about e-commerce, you know that is a huge deal.
[21:49.130 --> 21:52.950]  Getting people into your e-commerce platform is only the first hurdle.
[21:52.950 --> 21:55.650]  Getting them to go through the process of actually buying something,
[21:55.870 --> 21:57.030]  that's a whole other deal.
[21:57.150 --> 22:00.230]  And Shopify makes that process a lot easier.
[22:00.730 --> 22:03.810]  And that's why it powers 10 percent of all e-commerce in the U.S.
[22:04.210 --> 22:08.050]  and they are the global force behind Allbirds, Rothies, Brooklyn,
[22:08.170 --> 22:09.810]  and I actually have Brooklyn in sheets right now.
[22:10.070 --> 22:13.710]  Millions of other entrepreneurs across 175 countries.
[22:14.090 --> 22:15.590]  They help businesses grow.
[22:15.750 --> 22:17.730]  They're going to help the regulation company grow.
[22:18.270 --> 22:21.050]  We are still in the infancy of this company,
[22:21.050 --> 22:24.970]  but we are building out our Shopify e-commerce solution now and can't wait
[22:24.970 --> 22:27.530]  for a future of selling stuff through Shopify.

[22:48.270 --> 22:50.010]  Are we, are we done yelling about twisters?
[22:50.010 --> 22:51.490]  I have, I actually have something to share.
[22:51.970 --> 22:52.370]  Yeah, sure.
[22:53.070 --> 22:56.670]  Um, I got a message the other day, uh,
[23:00.150 --> 23:00.950]  from 1976.
[23:01.530 --> 23:01.830]  He was born.
[23:01.890 --> 23:02.190]  I got it.
[23:02.190 --> 23:03.030]  I got a message.
[23:03.330 --> 23:04.930]  It's Paul Shearer from 1994.
[23:04.930 --> 23:06.570]  He's one year younger than me.
[23:06.690 --> 23:07.250]  He's 48.
[23:07.410 --> 23:10.090]  It was weird that his mother was pregnant when he was 20 years old.
[23:10.350 --> 23:10.750]  Yeah.
[23:13.690 --> 23:17.770]  Uh, I got a message from, uh, a guy named Archie and he's like, hey,
[23:17.770 --> 23:20.370]  my girlfriend Kira is going to message you.
[23:20.710 --> 23:22.790]  Uh, she has something for the show.
[23:22.790 --> 23:26.050]  And I just, as soon as she messaged me, she said, Hey Eric.
[23:26.070 --> 23:27.810]  And I just sent her the PO box number.
[23:27.830 --> 23:29.590]  And I went like, that should probably take care of this.
[23:29.930 --> 23:31.950]  And she said, actually I have something else.
[23:32.590 --> 23:34.810]  I thought you'd like to meet these two guys.
[23:35.210 --> 23:38.550]  Let me, um, send a couple of images here.
[23:38.970 --> 23:40.810]  Thought you'd like to meet these two guys.
[23:41.110 --> 23:42.830]  Um, because I, I do agree.
[23:42.890 --> 23:44.210]  I think we do want to meet them.
[23:44.370 --> 23:45.610]  Isn't Leonardo DiCaprio still?
[23:46.210 --> 23:46.610]  No.
[23:47.130 --> 23:48.530]  They're two peregrine falcons.
[23:49.230 --> 23:54.050]  The one on the perch and with me, I should send a picture of her as well.
[23:54.230 --> 23:56.030]  The one on the perch is Geoff.
[23:56.670 --> 23:59.410]  The baby with the fluffy head is Eric.
[23:59.970 --> 24:04.630]  I will say Geoff was very intrigued by an apple and it was very cute.
[24:04.770 --> 24:07.270]  Big fan of the podcast here.
[24:07.630 --> 24:13.310]  She works at a sanctuary for falcons.
[24:14.250 --> 24:16.330]  She works at a sanctuary for falcons.
[24:16.610 --> 24:19.490]  And this is Geoff.
[24:20.590 --> 24:22.750]  Oh, that's my spirit animal.
[24:23.370 --> 24:24.210]  That's amazing.
[24:24.910 --> 24:25.910]  She's in Yorkshire.
[24:26.250 --> 24:30.950]  And this is, these are actual falcons named Geoff and Eric.
[24:31.270 --> 24:32.230]  That's crazy.
[24:32.570 --> 24:34.230]  Geoff is beautiful.
[24:34.730 --> 24:38.810]  So there was already a Geoff and then there's a new baby and they named it Eric.
[24:39.690 --> 24:44.450]  The, uh, the falcon that laid those eggs was actually in the day after tomorrow as an extra.
[24:47.050 --> 24:48.830]  Fun fact about that falcon.
[24:50.970 --> 24:52.110]  But there you go.
[24:52.250 --> 24:55.510]  Uh, Kira, thank you so much for sending in falcon news.
[24:55.650 --> 24:57.630]  Uh, so we are truly protected by falcons.
[24:57.750 --> 25:02.730]  I love that first picture of Geoff, the falcon on a perch next to an apple that really embodies.
[25:03.570 --> 25:07.590]  To me, to me, it really embodies the whole podcast.
[25:07.950 --> 25:08.470]  Yeah.
[25:09.850 --> 25:10.370]  Wow.
[25:10.530 --> 25:12.270]  What a, what a majestic creature.
[25:12.350 --> 25:12.950]  That's beautiful.
[25:14.090 --> 25:15.050]  Isn't that crazy?
[25:15.490 --> 25:15.730]  Yeah.
[25:15.730 --> 25:19.410]  Didn't falcons take down the whole world recently?
[25:19.890 --> 25:21.130]  Wasn't that bug?
[25:21.910 --> 25:26.350]  The, the, what the, the, the, where the all computers blue screened cloud strike bug.
[25:26.710 --> 25:27.170]  Yeah.
[25:27.250 --> 25:28.570]  Isn't wasn't the update.
[25:28.670 --> 25:31.270]  They tried to push that shut everything down called falcon.
[25:32.890 --> 25:33.570]  Oh yeah.
[25:33.590 --> 25:34.830]  It was something falcon, wasn't it?
[25:34.850 --> 25:35.910]  I think it was something falcon.
[25:36.010 --> 25:38.310]  I think the falcons took down all of the computers.
[25:38.750 --> 25:40.970]  The CrowdStrike falcon content update.
[25:41.290 --> 25:41.750]  Yeah.
[25:41.990 --> 25:42.130]  Yeah.
[25:42.310 --> 25:43.330]  Annihilated by falcons.
[25:43.470 --> 25:43.810]  Wow.
[25:44.330 --> 25:46.130]  Annihilated by falcons.
[25:46.450 --> 25:49.290]  What a cool way to go out, out of the annihilated by falcons.
[25:51.450 --> 25:51.810]  Wow.
[25:52.770 --> 25:53.970]  That's so cool.
[25:54.430 --> 25:56.270]  That's a, but yeah, I just wanted to share that.
[25:56.430 --> 26:01.190]  Thank you Kira for sending us a falcons named Geoff and Eric, which I think is really fantastic stuff.
[26:01.430 --> 26:01.650]  Awesome.
[26:01.690 --> 26:02.510]  That is awesome.
[26:02.710 --> 26:08.530]  If y'all don't mind, I have two, two, one really quick little thing that I'm, and then a brief little story.
[26:08.610 --> 26:08.950]  And then I'm out.
[26:09.030 --> 26:10.310]  I'm tapped out for the, for the week.
[26:10.950 --> 26:11.970]  Uh, that's not true.
[26:11.970 --> 26:14.390]  I have a million things, but I know everybody's got stuff to talk about.
[26:15.230 --> 26:19.850]  Uh, I, I demoed this on the, on the last of us live stream yesterday.
[26:19.930 --> 26:25.330]  So Nick and Gavin are aware of it, but I landed on a new idea for a little mini segment in the podcast.
[26:25.470 --> 26:30.850]  You know how we have like Gavin's life hacks that whenever somebody keys in on one, we bring it up and we talk about it.
[26:31.290 --> 26:36.410]  Well, I was thinking about that, that subreddit on Reddit, shower thoughts and how you're like, you're taking a shower.
[26:36.450 --> 26:39.890]  And then you think like, you have like a dumb incisive thought or whatever.
[26:39.890 --> 26:42.510]  I don't think you need to explain the premise of a shower thought, but.
[26:42.910 --> 26:43.150]  Oh, okay.
[26:43.250 --> 26:45.130]  Well, you know, I can never tell.
[26:45.190 --> 26:45.350]  Yeah.
[26:45.370 --> 26:46.390]  Shut up, Geoff.
[26:48.050 --> 26:48.890]  It's in the name.
[26:50.090 --> 26:53.170]  And, uh, I guess that's true.
[26:53.690 --> 26:55.870]  Well, it, this is also in the name too.
[26:56.170 --> 26:59.370]  I had an interesting thought while I was taking a dump two days ago.
[26:59.430 --> 27:04.390]  And I decided that I would like to birth, uh, to the podcast and to the world shitter thoughts.
[27:04.510 --> 27:07.130]  That's when you're sitting on the toilet, playing on your phone or whatever.
[27:07.210 --> 27:09.330]  You got your shit and shades on cause you're looking real cool.
[27:09.330 --> 27:11.570]  And then you have like an interesting thought, right?
[27:11.850 --> 27:15.730]  Like for instance, I'll, I'll debut it with my interesting, my first shitter thought.
[27:15.930 --> 27:18.930]  And I assume you guys will come back with shitter thoughts, uh, in the future.
[27:19.070 --> 27:19.450]  I have one.
[27:19.770 --> 27:20.490]  I also have one.
[27:20.650 --> 27:25.190]  I use a toilet scrubber more times a day than I use a fork.
[27:26.290 --> 27:27.090]  That's insane.
[27:27.450 --> 27:28.330]  That can't be true.
[27:28.490 --> 27:29.210]  What the fuck?
[27:29.470 --> 27:30.930]  Yeah, I was thinking about it.
[27:31.150 --> 27:34.750]  I use a toilet scrubber three to four times a day right now since, since Detroit.
[27:34.870 --> 27:35.850]  It just hasn't stopped.
[27:36.030 --> 27:38.110]  But, uh, I probably only use a fork twice a day.
[27:38.110 --> 27:42.950]  Now I'm confused by this because I always assumed that your shits were just as liquid as
[27:43.770 --> 27:44.170]  shit.
[27:44.490 --> 27:47.250]  And I don't know why all the liquid is sticking to the bowl.
[27:47.890 --> 27:50.270]  I just, I've been having real bad explosive shits.
[27:50.910 --> 27:51.610]  And a lot of them.
[27:51.790 --> 27:52.990]  Oh, so it's like, oh.
[27:53.610 --> 27:55.190]  So it's like spraying up high.
[27:55.570 --> 27:56.190]  That's terrible.
[27:56.270 --> 28:00.510]  They're like, a lot of them, a lot of it is getting, uh, like it's above the clean line,
[28:00.770 --> 28:01.010]  you know?
[28:01.170 --> 28:01.410]  Yeah.
[28:01.850 --> 28:02.630]  I've been having that issue.
[28:03.130 --> 28:03.370]  Yeah.
[28:03.990 --> 28:06.050]  But it's definitely like probably three or four times a day.
[28:06.050 --> 28:08.470]  I got that toilet scrubber on my hand and I'm like, holy shit, man.
[28:08.570 --> 28:09.190]  I don't use it.
[28:09.290 --> 28:11.090]  I don't, I don't put anything in my mouth this many times.
[28:11.470 --> 28:14.690]  You start to realize what tools are actually important to you in your life.
[28:15.510 --> 28:22.890]  In a similar shit of thought, I realized yesterday that the bar I got drunk at the most was the
[28:22.890 --> 28:23.690]  off topic set.
[28:26.390 --> 28:30.950]  Like I've been drunk, I've been drinking in a lot of bars, but the place that I frequented
[28:30.950 --> 28:33.250]  the most to get drunk at was work.
[28:33.250 --> 28:35.970]  And I just, that's pretty, pretty weird.
[28:36.670 --> 28:38.470]  That's a very funny shit of thought.
[28:38.570 --> 28:40.590]  That's a, thanks for sharing that Gavin, that's a great one.
[28:41.510 --> 28:44.190]  Anyway, so if anybody ever has a shit of thought, feel free to share it.
[28:44.350 --> 28:47.690]  Uh, the other thing I have is a little story I want to tell you guys of something that
[28:47.690 --> 28:49.910]  truly bizarre that happened to me.
[28:50.310 --> 28:55.510]  Uh, the other day I was driving home from somewhere and it was dusk and nobody was home.
[28:55.550 --> 28:59.790]  I was driving, I was going to come home to an empty house and I, uh, I pulled up into
[28:59.790 --> 29:03.670]  my driveway and I just like, as I was getting out of the car, it was one of those days where
[29:03.670 --> 29:07.770]  it was like somehow 80 degrees at 7pm and it was just breezy and nice.
[29:07.890 --> 29:09.950]  And you're like, I don't want to, I just didn't want to go inside.
[29:10.270 --> 29:11.690]  And I thought, Oh, I can go for a bike ride.
[29:11.770 --> 29:13.450]  Then I was like, I don't want to pull my bike out.
[29:13.490 --> 29:15.970]  And I'm not sure charged enough because I went already once today.
[29:16.150 --> 29:17.590]  And you know, it just seems like a hassle.
[29:17.690 --> 29:21.330]  So I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna walk out of my car and not even go into my house, just
[29:21.330 --> 29:24.290]  turn around and hit the sidewalk and take a left and go for a walk.
[29:25.070 --> 29:29.770]  And right as I did that, I think what would have happened is I would have got about five
[29:29.770 --> 29:31.430]  feet and realized, Oh, I don't have headphones.
[29:31.610 --> 29:32.990]  This is going to be a boring walk.
[29:33.090 --> 29:34.250]  I need to turn around and go get headphones.
[29:35.050 --> 29:40.910]  But I was distracted because like four or five steps in, all of a sudden out of nowhere,
[29:40.910 --> 29:47.490]  I hear zombie by the cranberries and it like really like slow, like quietly.
[29:47.630 --> 29:48.590]  And then it gets louder and louder.
[29:48.650 --> 29:53.570]  And I turn around and there's a guy on a bicycle who's got like a, well, like a beats boombox
[29:53.570 --> 29:55.530]  type thing and is in a little basket on the front.
[29:55.530 --> 29:59.490]  And it's playing blaring zombie by the cranberries, cranberries.
[29:59.770 --> 30:02.110]  And glad I made that flip.
[30:02.470 --> 30:06.770]  And he just zips past me and keeps going down the road.
[30:07.250 --> 30:09.470]  And so I hear zombie really loud.
[30:09.470 --> 30:10.930]  And then it gets kind of quieter and quieter.
[30:10.990 --> 30:11.550]  And then it disappears.
[30:11.690 --> 30:16.450]  I just think it's fucking funny that I heard zombie out of nowhere like that.
[30:16.870 --> 30:20.910]  And this guy was just like, he's like a young dude, like about 25, just blaring it.
[30:21.390 --> 30:25.210]  And I, at this point, I'm like blocks away and I'm thinking about that.
[30:25.210 --> 30:28.950]  I'm not realizing that I don't have my headphones in because if I had my headphones, none of this
[30:28.950 --> 30:29.290]  happens.
[30:29.830 --> 30:31.750]  And so I go a little bit further.
[30:31.750 --> 30:34.730]  And as I'm maybe two or three blocks down the road, I hear zombie again.
[30:34.730 --> 30:36.410]  And I look up and he's coming back at me.
[30:36.450 --> 30:39.490]  And I'm like, and he just goes back by me, like in reverse.
[30:39.570 --> 30:41.910]  And I was like, oh, he must have dropped something off or went back the other way.
[30:42.010 --> 30:44.590]  And I was thinking, that's a long song.
[30:44.930 --> 30:48.070]  Like, you don't realize how long that song must be, but that's been playing for a while.
[30:48.910 --> 30:49.990]  And I keep walking.
[30:50.170 --> 30:54.130]  And at this point, at some somewhere around here, I realize I don't have my headphones,
[30:54.130 --> 30:56.830]  but I'm five or six blocks from home at this point.
[30:56.990 --> 30:57.990]  And I'm already into the walk.
[30:58.070 --> 31:00.250]  So I'm like, I just, you know, be alone with my thoughts.
[31:00.710 --> 31:06.610]  And then as I'm walking to the left of me, very faintly, I hear zombie playing.
[31:07.370 --> 31:09.990]  And as I walk, it follows me.
[31:10.250 --> 31:14.750]  And I realized the guy's riding around the neighborhood still listening to zombie play,
[31:14.950 --> 31:15.690]  listen to zombie.
[31:16.610 --> 31:20.090]  And he and he's just somewhere near me, but I can't tell where.
[31:20.550 --> 31:25.170]  And I go right to get away from it because I'm like, that's enough fucking cranberries for me.
[31:25.490 --> 31:26.470]  And it goes away.
[31:26.490 --> 31:30.110]  And then like two minutes later, I hear it again, but it's in a different side of me.
[31:30.210 --> 31:35.350]  And I'm starting to give the effect that this guy's circling me while listening to the cranberries.
[31:35.550 --> 31:39.330]  And I'm like, surely the song is on repeat because it would have ended by now.
[31:39.490 --> 31:43.170]  And so I just start, I start to get a little annoyed and I start changing up the way I'm
[31:43.170 --> 31:44.970]  walking so even I don't know where I'm going.
[31:45.030 --> 31:45.250]  Right.
[31:45.270 --> 31:48.410]  And I just try to get far and far away and I'll get away from it for a while.
[31:48.410 --> 31:50.150]  And then every once in a while I'll hear it.
[31:50.330 --> 31:51.410]  And then it'll get really loud.
[31:51.530 --> 31:53.030]  And I'm like, this motherfucker is right on top of me.
[31:53.230 --> 31:55.590]  And I'm like looking for him and I stop and I'm looking to see where he goes.
[31:55.730 --> 31:57.810]  And he never, and I never see him.
[31:57.890 --> 31:59.510]  He never quite comes into my view.
[31:59.590 --> 32:00.650]  He's always like a block away.
[32:00.990 --> 32:02.870]  And then he gets quiet again, quiet again.
[32:02.990 --> 32:06.490]  And it has the effect of like when you read stories about how people camp,
[32:06.530 --> 32:11.510]  like in the Appalachians at night and they hear a voice right outside their camp going to help.
[32:11.830 --> 32:14.910]  And then it'll like circle the camp and get close and then get far away.
[32:14.910 --> 32:16.590]  And they're trying to draw you out of the tent.
[32:16.590 --> 32:19.250]  They always say like, that's the succubus or whatever, stay in your tent.
[32:19.650 --> 32:20.570]  It felt like that.
[32:20.650 --> 32:24.290]  It felt like I was being taunted and, and stalked by the cranberries.
[32:24.310 --> 32:29.250]  And I walked for 45 minutes and the longest it left me alone was about 12 minutes.
[32:29.530 --> 32:34.190]  The rest of the time there were the fucking cranberries were playing zombie
[32:34.670 --> 32:39.130]  somewhere in the periphery around me until like maybe the last five minutes.
[32:39.130 --> 32:40.850]  When I got kind of close to home, I didn't hear it anymore,
[32:40.850 --> 32:44.710]  but it was the fucking freakiest thing I've ever experienced.
[32:44.710 --> 32:48.690]  And it got me thinking, have you guys ever been stalked by a song before?
[32:48.910 --> 32:54.890]  Because I got stalked for 45 fucking minutes by dead Dolores Reardon and the cranberries.
[32:55.030 --> 32:56.130]  And it was weird.
[32:57.090 --> 32:58.570]  I have so many questions.
[33:00.310 --> 33:01.950]  So you never saw the guy again?
[33:02.510 --> 33:03.910]  I only saw him twice.
[33:03.950 --> 33:05.410]  I saw him the first time he rode by me.
[33:05.470 --> 33:09.030]  And then when he came back by me at the very beginning, in the first like 15 minutes.
[33:09.310 --> 33:11.770]  Was there any interaction with the guy when he went by?
[33:12.030 --> 33:13.970]  No, no, I didn't make eye contact with him or anything.
[33:13.970 --> 33:14.750]  He wasn't looking at me.
[33:14.930 --> 33:16.650]  He wasn't concerned with me at all.
[33:16.730 --> 33:19.630]  He was just like riding down the road, listening to the cranberries.
[33:20.210 --> 33:24.330]  Do you think like the sync on his iPod got interrupted or something?
[33:24.450 --> 33:25.470]  He only had one song.
[33:25.850 --> 33:27.450]  But weirder than that, he had an iPod.
[33:27.550 --> 33:31.190]  I don't fucking know, but it is such a...
[33:31.190 --> 33:33.590]  Dude, I mean, if you think about it, it is such a...
[33:33.590 --> 33:41.610]  It is such a move to listen to one song in public for an hour loudly, you know?
[33:41.610 --> 33:44.010]  And then it's also like, that's a statement, right?
[33:44.090 --> 33:50.990]  Or what kind of person only wants to listen to one song over and over and over again?
[33:51.030 --> 33:51.890]  And I am sorry.
[33:52.490 --> 33:53.710]  I like the cranberries.
[33:53.850 --> 33:54.970]  I am of that era.
[33:55.150 --> 33:58.730]  I saw them perform at Liberty Lunch live in like 1997.
[33:59.930 --> 34:01.170]  Yeah, 1997.
[34:01.570 --> 34:03.350]  I consider myself a cranberries fan.
[34:03.830 --> 34:09.230]  That dude listened to that song more times in 45 minutes than I've listened to it in 30 years.
[34:09.990 --> 34:12.850]  There's all kinds of weirdness surrounding this.
[34:13.010 --> 34:16.350]  There was a time in the UK, I think in the 80s or something,
[34:16.450 --> 34:20.870]  where one of the radio DJs lost his mind and started just playing the same song over and over again.
[34:21.190 --> 34:22.890]  Maybe that was happening. He was just on the radio.
[34:23.510 --> 34:28.110]  It might have been, or it's like some glitch in the matrix, but it was fucking weird.
[34:28.970 --> 34:32.110]  And now, had I had my headphones, I never would have heard it.
[34:32.130 --> 34:32.910]  I never would have noticed it.
[34:32.930 --> 34:34.850]  I would have just been listening to music or a podcast, you know?
[34:35.390 --> 34:37.530]  And it was only because he...
[34:37.530 --> 34:38.550]  That's the weird thing too.
[34:38.550 --> 34:42.690]  It's only because he lulled me far enough away from my house with the cranberries
[34:42.690 --> 34:47.630]  where I realized I was too far to turn around and go back to get my headphones that I even...
[34:47.630 --> 34:50.630]  Like, he created this scenario that then I was trapped in.
[34:50.770 --> 34:51.610]  Really bizarre.
[34:52.490 --> 34:56.150]  Who has heard one song more often?
[34:57.150 --> 35:01.790]  Mick Jagger or like a 15-year ice cream truck driver?
[35:02.970 --> 35:04.590]  Oh, ice cream truck driver.
[35:05.290 --> 35:06.210]  You think? You think so?
[35:06.210 --> 35:13.070]  I'm trying to think of like a long lasting band that's played hits for a very long amount of time
[35:13.650 --> 35:17.170]  up against a profession in which you hear one song over and over again.
[35:17.530 --> 35:19.050]  Because it's seasonal, right?
[35:19.170 --> 35:25.790]  I mean, is anyone an ice cream man for their entire life?
[35:26.530 --> 35:27.730]  Somebody has to have been.
[35:28.530 --> 35:29.550]  Family business.
[35:29.950 --> 35:35.270]  When I was a kid in Alabama, the ice cream truck would come by the house all the time
[35:35.270 --> 35:39.970]  and my grandma would never let me go because she said that the ice cream man sold drugs.
[35:40.270 --> 35:44.430]  And so the ice cream truck was something I saw on TV and out my window,
[35:44.430 --> 35:46.970]  but I didn't experience for a couple of years.
[35:47.070 --> 35:47.710]  Oh, man.
[35:48.150 --> 35:48.710]  It was rough.
[35:51.310 --> 35:53.470]  And I didn't get ice cream or drugs.
[35:55.850 --> 35:56.790]  How disappointing.
[35:57.490 --> 35:58.390]  What a waste.
[36:00.490 --> 36:02.810]  That's a really weird thing, Geoff.
[36:03.350 --> 36:04.870]  Yeah, it's just a weird fucking story.
[36:04.870 --> 36:06.890]  So many things I wouldn't have done.
[36:07.030 --> 36:08.090]  Normally, I would have had my bike.
[36:08.370 --> 36:09.430]  Normally, I would have had headphones.
[36:09.570 --> 36:11.590]  Even if I'd gone for a walk, I would have had headphones.
[36:12.010 --> 36:16.490]  It was just something about the time of day and it being magic hour and nobody being home.
[36:17.070 --> 36:18.910]  And then it was just so weird.
[36:19.410 --> 36:22.690]  And I just kept thinking, how could this guy still be listening to this song?
[36:23.070 --> 36:25.930]  How is it physically possible that he's only...
[36:25.930 --> 36:26.210]  The volume is changing?
[36:26.750 --> 36:28.670]  No, he's just like, listen, he's blaring it.
[36:28.830 --> 36:29.490]  It sounded like on...
[36:29.490 --> 36:30.270]  No, it's for you.
[36:30.870 --> 36:31.390]  Oh, yeah.
[36:31.490 --> 36:33.370]  And the volume is changing because he's getting further and further away.
[36:33.370 --> 36:34.090]  And I just like...
[36:34.090 --> 36:35.250]  It was just so weird.
[36:35.350 --> 36:36.850]  I thought like, all right, I'm not going to hear it anymore.
[36:36.950 --> 36:37.690]  Surely I won't hear it anymore.
[36:38.110 --> 36:39.510]  And you're like, all right, is he fucking with me?
[36:39.610 --> 36:40.590]  Am I imagining it?
[36:40.690 --> 36:41.190]  Am I...
[36:41.190 --> 36:43.070]  Do you try to convince yourself that you're imagining it?
[36:43.250 --> 36:44.750]  And then you're like, no, no, I'm definitely...
[36:44.750 --> 36:45.150]  It's loud.
[36:45.230 --> 36:46.010]  I'm definitely hearing it.
[36:46.090 --> 36:46.730]  You know, it's like...
[36:46.730 --> 36:51.450]  Were you definitely making progress throughout the walk or could it have been a time loop?
[36:51.630 --> 36:52.570]  No, I was making progress.
[36:52.630 --> 36:53.450]  I was just walking through my neighborhood.
[36:53.990 --> 36:54.070]  Yeah.
[36:54.510 --> 36:54.830]  Interesting.
[36:55.130 --> 36:56.250]  Yeah, I've got no answers for that.
[36:56.790 --> 36:57.330]  Yeah, it's weird.
[36:57.970 --> 36:59.610]  It was just that guy and I...
[36:59.610 --> 37:02.530]  The real answer is that guy and I were just synced up.
[37:02.530 --> 37:06.250]  You know, like he was just going for an evening bike ride and I was going for an evening walk
[37:06.250 --> 37:09.030]  and we just were crossing paths a lot.
[37:09.190 --> 37:12.370]  And he is, you know, mentally ill and only knows one song.
[37:13.470 --> 37:17.330]  What's really funny about that is to him, this is an odd story, which I think is great.
[37:17.410 --> 37:21.650]  There's another half to this that is so unmemorable, he will not tell anybody.
[37:22.310 --> 37:24.030]  For him, he was just out on a bike ride.
[37:24.170 --> 37:24.690]  This only...
[37:24.690 --> 37:27.290]  Even though we were both there, this only happened to one of us.
[37:28.030 --> 37:28.270]  Yeah.
[37:29.530 --> 37:31.470]  This is not a shared experience in any way.
[37:31.470 --> 37:32.350]  No, not at all.
[37:33.690 --> 37:34.170]  That's...
[37:34.170 --> 37:35.630]  What were you going to say, Gavin, sorry?
[37:36.650 --> 37:37.430]  I don't know.
[37:42.950 --> 37:45.210]  I assumed you were going to pivot topics.
[37:46.390 --> 37:48.850]  Just real quick, and then you guys can pivot topics.
[37:49.090 --> 37:51.070]  The entire time Geoff was telling that story,
[37:51.110 --> 37:53.590]  I was watching the last three outs of the Padres game
[37:53.590 --> 37:56.230]  where we just threw our second no hitter ever.
[37:56.850 --> 38:01.670]  So I'm listening to Geoff tell this story about being stalked by a song
[38:01.670 --> 38:03.370]  and I have my headphones on.
[38:03.470 --> 38:05.910]  I'm watching a screen and I'm pacing around the room.
[38:06.310 --> 38:08.690]  Just going, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[38:08.810 --> 38:09.610]  Oh my God.
[38:09.990 --> 38:10.730]  That was crazy.
[38:10.910 --> 38:11.690]  Who threw it?
[38:12.490 --> 38:13.210]  Dylan Cease.
[38:13.590 --> 38:15.210]  He's the second Padre to ever do it.
[38:15.350 --> 38:15.930]  Yeah, huge.
[38:16.190 --> 38:17.330]  The last time was 2021.
[38:17.770 --> 38:17.950]  Nuts.
[38:17.990 --> 38:19.890]  I think I have a Dylan Cease RPA, actually.
[38:20.030 --> 38:20.350]  That's cool.
[38:20.470 --> 38:22.350]  Yeah, he was a White Sox for a long time.
[38:23.450 --> 38:27.010]  But now, Gavin, why don't you take us away with your next fun story?
[38:27.410 --> 38:28.730]  How do happy endings work?
[38:29.310 --> 38:29.630]  Okay.
[38:29.810 --> 38:30.750]  What do you mean, like...
[38:30.750 --> 38:32.790]  Andrew, why don't you take us away?
[38:33.350 --> 38:36.910]  Well, no, my thing would relate to that.
[38:36.970 --> 38:38.370]  So let's go through Gavin's.
[38:38.970 --> 38:39.770]  What do you mean?
[38:41.490 --> 38:42.290]  Logistically or...
[38:42.730 --> 38:45.950]  When... I mean, I've never been to a place that offers it, right?
[38:46.370 --> 38:47.130]  That you're aware of.
[38:48.030 --> 38:48.750]  Well, that's true.
[38:49.350 --> 38:50.670]  But do you know it's coming?
[38:51.510 --> 38:53.770]  Or, like, do you ask for it in the beginning?
[38:53.910 --> 38:54.350]  Something's coming, yeah.
[38:54.810 --> 38:55.190]  You do?
[38:56.730 --> 39:00.430]  I just said, I think something's coming, but I don't know how it works.
[39:00.430 --> 39:01.890]  Why don't you go ahead and give us a breakdown?
[39:04.250 --> 39:06.130]  I think it's insane to assume.
[39:06.750 --> 39:12.570]  Well, I just think if I sat down, it was like, yeah, all right, you've ordered the 90-minute
[39:13.850 --> 39:16.450]  signature massage with a happy ending.
[39:16.930 --> 39:19.830]  I'd be like, I don't think I would enjoy any of the massage.
[39:21.650 --> 39:23.210]  I would just be waiting for the...
[39:24.150 --> 39:25.790]  I'd be... because there's no clock.
[39:26.410 --> 39:29.970]  So I'd be like, if she's, like, turning me over or, like, moving on to a different bit,
[39:29.970 --> 39:32.030]  I was like, oh god, is this the happy ending?
[39:32.290 --> 39:34.950]  I think the whole experience would be miserable.
[39:36.350 --> 39:37.990]  I hate what you've done.
[39:38.370 --> 39:41.330]  You've just accidentally ruined some food for me.
[39:41.850 --> 39:42.770]  That's horrendous.
[39:46.770 --> 39:50.570]  I've never thought about the idea of the happy ending being on the menu.
[39:51.070 --> 39:55.550]  Of, like, the stone massage with a happy ending as a side.
[39:55.910 --> 40:02.150]  A lot of the Japanese places in my area refer to their deep fried
[40:02.970 --> 40:05.010]  sushi rolls as happy.
[40:05.210 --> 40:06.630]  That is the qualifier.
[40:06.830 --> 40:14.850]  So, like, happy California roll, happy this roll, happy teriyaki roll, happy tug job roll.
[40:15.690 --> 40:18.830]  Yeah, whenever I see that on a menu now, I'm going to just think of cum,
[40:19.150 --> 40:23.610]  which is not what I want in my head when I'm going to have food.
[40:24.330 --> 40:28.350]  Yeah, I realized that, uh, I would only, I think I would only be able to enjoy it
[40:28.350 --> 40:33.310]  if it was offered at, right at the end, right before it happened.
[40:37.050 --> 40:38.890]  Well, this is insane.
[40:39.150 --> 40:41.890]  Let's throw, let's, let's say that this is on the menu.
[40:42.270 --> 40:47.550]  Let's say that this is a thing that the person has checked off that they want.
[40:48.590 --> 40:50.090]  It comes at the end, right?
[40:50.150 --> 40:51.050]  That's the whole point.
[40:51.210 --> 40:52.910]  So you just know that that's the end of it.
[40:52.910 --> 40:54.750]  Why would you be stressed in that scenario?
[40:55.050 --> 40:57.070]  That's like saying you're stressed about eating dinner
[40:57.070 --> 40:59.230]  because you know there's a really good dessert at the end.
[40:59.670 --> 40:59.890]  Yeah.
[41:00.050 --> 41:02.550]  It's like saying that you're stressed watching a movie going,
[41:02.670 --> 41:05.210]  this is going to, is this the end? Is it about the end?
[41:05.390 --> 41:06.890]  I don't know. I think it freaked me out.
[41:07.210 --> 41:09.030]  I would be freaked out for way different reasons.
[41:09.090 --> 41:09.930]  I would be self-conscious.
[41:10.130 --> 41:12.490]  I would feel like I was going to get in trouble with somebody.
[41:12.650 --> 41:14.330]  I would feel like my mom would find out.
[41:14.410 --> 41:18.130]  I would feel like the person doing it secretly hated it and was grossed out by me
[41:18.130 --> 41:21.490]  or was like, oh, what a disgusting wiener this loser has.
[41:21.490 --> 41:24.610]  I would be so self-conscious about me and the whole process
[41:24.610 --> 41:27.670]  and feel like I was doing something wrong, even if I ordered it off a menu.
[41:27.850 --> 41:29.090]  And you know what I mean?
[41:29.210 --> 41:31.890]  I would say, yeah, I'd know I'd go to the bathroom.
[41:31.990 --> 41:34.870]  Everything is above board. It's legal. Everyone is consensual.
[41:35.010 --> 41:36.670]  It's all good. It's on the menu.
[41:37.290 --> 41:39.110]  I would say just, I don't know.
[41:40.230 --> 41:41.930]  I'd be like, I'm not very hungry.
[41:42.070 --> 41:42.850]  This, here's the menu.
[41:42.890 --> 41:45.270]  In a million years, I could never do it.
[41:45.330 --> 41:45.530]  Yeah.
[41:46.490 --> 41:48.050]  I'd just be like, just the normal please.
[41:48.590 --> 41:49.950]  So you'd want it surprised.
[41:50.410 --> 41:52.330]  I'll just have a regular ending, please.
[41:53.010 --> 41:54.710]  Yeah, I'd have to go for the regular ending.
[41:55.210 --> 41:58.550]  Unless it was, unless they just, you know, sometimes you get a haircut
[41:58.550 --> 41:59.650]  and they just trim your eyebrows.
[42:00.810 --> 42:02.810]  No, no, I don't.
[42:02.990 --> 42:03.350]  You never had that?
[42:03.390 --> 42:07.570]  I was never, 29 years living, never had that happen.
[42:08.410 --> 42:11.910]  You're saying they trim your, they trim your eyebrows?
[42:12.250 --> 42:12.950]  Is that what you said?
[42:13.050 --> 42:13.510]  You've seen his eyebrows.
[42:14.550 --> 42:14.990]  What?
[42:15.590 --> 42:18.790]  Yeah, my guy would just, would just go down to the eyebrows.
[42:18.790 --> 42:20.330]  I think it happened to Gus once too.
[42:21.310 --> 42:22.530]  Well, fucking Gus needs it.
[42:22.630 --> 42:23.610]  Shit happened to Gus more than once.
[42:25.370 --> 42:29.070]  I've never, I've never had my eyebrows trimmed.
[42:29.790 --> 42:30.990]  Then you ain't lived.
[42:31.410 --> 42:32.530]  I guess not.
[42:32.930 --> 42:34.850]  Is it, is it nice?
[42:35.050 --> 42:35.990]  Do you like it?
[42:36.490 --> 42:40.110]  No, but it's not, it's not expected.
[42:40.390 --> 42:41.310]  It just happens.
[42:42.170 --> 42:45.510]  Because, because if, if he said at the beginning,
[42:46.230 --> 42:49.030]  Oh yeah, I'll shorten up the back and sides and all that.
[42:49.090 --> 42:50.950]  I'll give you a little bit on top and then I'll go for your eyebrows.
[42:51.110 --> 42:52.350]  I'd be like, no, don't worry about the eyebrows.
[42:53.070 --> 42:55.710]  But because he just does it, I'm just like, okay.
[42:57.550 --> 42:58.210]  I've, yeah.
[42:58.970 --> 43:01.310]  Is this something multiple barbers have done to you?
[43:01.430 --> 43:02.890]  Or is it just your current guy?
[43:03.170 --> 43:03.970]  Just my current guy.
[43:04.790 --> 43:05.150]  Interesting.
[43:05.370 --> 43:05.630]  Okay.
[43:06.150 --> 43:09.890]  But I don't think my eyebrows were as out of control when I didn't have this guy.
[43:10.410 --> 43:10.950]  Got it.
[43:11.450 --> 43:12.410]  It's an age thing.
[43:13.070 --> 43:13.690]  I got it.
[43:13.690 --> 43:14.090]  Yeah.
[43:15.270 --> 43:16.710]  I think it's so much worse.
[43:16.810 --> 43:18.550]  The scenario you're describing for the happy ending.
[43:19.090 --> 43:19.550]  In what way?
[43:20.390 --> 43:24.210]  The idea of it being a surprise makes it so much more stressful to me.
[43:25.250 --> 43:26.110]  How can it be stressful?
[43:27.170 --> 43:29.970]  Well, having the scenario in which you could be asked.
[43:30.550 --> 43:32.550]  Oh, like the plausibility.
[43:33.110 --> 43:37.350]  Yeah, like coming and that you have the thing that Gavin is wanting in his world
[43:37.350 --> 43:41.030]  would be so much worse to me than it being a choice at the beginning.
[43:41.530 --> 43:42.910]  You can opt in or out of.
[43:42.910 --> 43:44.530]  I mean, I don't want this.
[43:45.690 --> 43:46.410]  That's fine.
[43:46.490 --> 43:47.030]  No one's saying you.
[43:47.130 --> 43:52.790]  I'm just you're bringing up a scenario in which it was possible in your world of it being a yes.
[43:53.330 --> 43:57.870]  You saying it was more stressful knowing it's eventually coming as opposed to.
[44:04.230 --> 44:08.810]  Yeah, I think I just haven't lived a sleazy enough lifestyle to know
[44:09.350 --> 44:11.130]  anything about that kind of thing.
[44:11.170 --> 44:12.490]  But I am fascinated by it.
[44:12.910 --> 44:16.010]  You know, so do you when you go into a massage place, do you say this?
[44:16.250 --> 44:19.170]  This isn't one of them tug job operations.
[44:19.890 --> 44:21.230]  You just come out front.
[44:21.730 --> 44:22.990]  No happiness here.
[44:23.030 --> 44:23.690]  Am I right?
[44:23.870 --> 44:25.290]  And then you wink at him.
[44:26.550 --> 44:30.130]  Well, I believe you're like, give me the Robert Kraft wink wink.
[44:30.730 --> 44:32.790]  I mean, that's not places here that do it right.
[44:33.130 --> 44:36.250]  I assume like when I'm picturing this happen, it isn't like Thailand or something.
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.370]  No, I have no idea.
[44:38.690 --> 44:40.650]  I don't think any of us are an authority on this.
[44:40.650 --> 44:43.030]  I'd assume it's more widespread than you think.
[44:43.470 --> 44:46.750]  But once again, really not an authority on this in any way.
[44:46.830 --> 44:47.870]  I'm purely guessing.
[44:48.510 --> 44:49.570]  Nick says under the table.
[44:49.770 --> 44:55.790]  I like the idea of being creepy for like being creepy in the reverse way of not wanting the
[44:55.790 --> 44:56.370]  creepy thing.
[44:57.430 --> 45:02.170]  Like coming in a blatantly be like, as I was saying, like, no tug jobs in here.
[45:02.230 --> 45:02.650]  Am I right?
[45:02.750 --> 45:04.650]  Like, let's no, no tugs allowed.
[45:04.850 --> 45:08.270]  Like, just just to be clear, I'm not getting tugged off.
[45:08.670 --> 45:09.110]  Yes.
[45:09.110 --> 45:17.290]  Yeah, I would hate it if anyone just started jerking me off out of nowhere.
[45:17.430 --> 45:21.350]  Oh, it would make me so mad if that happened.
[45:21.350 --> 45:27.830]  I would give this less than three stars on Yelp if there's any touching in that area.
[45:28.950 --> 45:32.770]  I would hate it if someone offered to tug off my perfectly normal and clean penis.
[45:37.550 --> 45:41.390]  Someone just walks out of the room after getting a massage.
[45:41.550 --> 45:44.290]  Hey, they didn't ask to get tugged, did they?
[45:45.490 --> 45:46.830]  Want to make sure.
[45:47.950 --> 45:49.090]  Police in this place.
[45:50.770 --> 45:51.920]  Oh, man, this is...
[45:52.990 --> 45:55.230]  This is just what you think of all the time, Gavin?
[45:55.290 --> 45:55.850]  Is that what happened?
[45:56.430 --> 45:57.850]  One of my shit thoughts.
[45:58.090 --> 45:58.870]  My shitter thoughts.
[46:02.100 --> 46:05.600]  I, uh, I think I had a toenail dream the other night.
[46:05.660 --> 46:06.320]  Oh, God.
[46:07.040 --> 46:07.760]  Fucking disgusting.
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.360]  I know. The other day, I, uh, I remember the other day I went to cut my toenails and I was
[46:13.360 --> 46:17.320]  like, oh, I need to cut my toenails and my, my, my, specifically my big toe on my right foot.
[46:17.760 --> 46:20.180]  And I went to cut it and it didn't need to be cut.
[46:20.260 --> 46:25.500]  But I distinctly remembered, like, my toe and my shoe and bugging me and then touching it and
[46:25.500 --> 46:28.880]  going like, oh, I need to cut my toenail. My toenail's too big. But that must have never
[46:28.880 --> 46:34.460]  happened because my toenail didn't need to be cut. So did I have a dream that I needed to cut
[46:34.460 --> 46:38.920]  my toenails? And if so, is that where I am in life where I can't tell the difference?
[46:38.980 --> 46:42.520]  My dreams are so boring. I can't tell the difference if they're real or not because
[46:42.520 --> 46:43.540]  they're that mundane.
[46:46.880 --> 46:50.680]  Maybe, maybe you're just living like your dream lifestyle and you can't
[46:50.680 --> 46:52.240]  imagine anything better than this.
[46:52.760 --> 46:57.500]  I don't know, but I definitely didn't need to cut my toenail, but I definitely remembered
[46:57.500 --> 46:59.940]  needing to cut my toenail. So it must have been a dream.
[47:00.460 --> 47:04.960]  I had a terrible dream the other night in a hotel where I was once again, just dreaming
[47:04.960 --> 47:08.960]  through my eyes. Like I was dreaming about the room. I was dreaming about me just lying in bed.
[47:09.360 --> 47:14.440]  And I was like, I'm doing this just boring dream thing again. And I could figure it out
[47:14.440 --> 47:17.520]  because I looked at the time and I couldn't read the time. I was like, oh, I'm dreaming again.
[47:18.020 --> 47:23.520]  And then suddenly Meg walked into the hotel room and I just turned over and didn't listen
[47:23.520 --> 47:26.680]  to her because I was like, I don't want to, I don't want to talk to the dream version.
[47:26.680 --> 47:29.520]  I want the real version. This dream version of Meg isn't real.
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.980]  That's what you dream about? You dream about ignoring Meg?
[47:32.560 --> 47:34.560]  Why? Ignoring the dreamer.
[47:35.960 --> 47:39.980]  I wanted the real her, not the fake one. I don't want my mind's version of her.
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.400]  I didn't even, I didn't even let her get a word out.
[47:46.700 --> 47:49.380]  She came in to tell me something and I just turned over.
[47:49.840 --> 47:51.480]  It was so important too, probably.
[47:52.500 --> 47:57.280]  What do you think the happiest time is in a 24 hour clock?
[47:58.080 --> 48:00.500]  5.01 p.m. 5.01?
[48:01.220 --> 48:03.860]  Yeah, it's got, it's got to be somewhere right around that.
[48:03.980 --> 48:05.720]  Yeah, yeah. Right. As soon as work's over.
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.260]  Yeah, because we have cool jobs, but from like, yes, for most of my life, 5.01 p.m.
[48:12.840 --> 48:16.160]  You're right. Yeah. Like the minute work ends is typically my best.
[48:16.180 --> 48:20.280]  The greatest minute of the week is 5.01 p.m. on Friday.
[48:20.820 --> 48:26.120]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Especially if you're already done and you see that clock you've been,
[48:26.320 --> 48:31.200]  you've, you fucking ducked out two hours ago and you look at the clock and you see 5.01 and you go,
[48:31.320 --> 48:33.980]  I made it out. I escaped two hours early.
[48:34.160 --> 48:35.880]  I'm getting off a shitty job.
[48:36.260 --> 48:40.360]  Fucking start. I just cheated two hours out of life. Yeah, it's the best.
[48:40.360 --> 48:42.180]  Oh, I feel so good right now.
[48:42.340 --> 48:47.340]  Just the fucking best feeling when you just work a dog shit job and you go,
[48:47.340 --> 48:52.200]  oh, I got away with it and now I'm done for a couple of days.
[48:52.480 --> 48:58.320]  And this is the exact moment when it's the largest amount of time between now and I gotta do it again.
[48:59.060 --> 48:59.720]  That is it.
[49:00.080 --> 49:03.960]  Maybe every Friday when we're streaming on Twitch, we should celebrate 5.01.
[49:04.360 --> 49:07.080]  No, we can't because it's not, it's not the same.
[49:07.500 --> 49:08.680]  This is, I enjoy this work.
[49:08.700 --> 49:08.960]  What do you mean?
[49:09.140 --> 49:09.700]  I enjoy this job.
[49:11.220 --> 49:11.780]  Yeah, we're lucky.
[49:12.000 --> 49:13.720]  No, we're celebrating it for everyone else.
[49:13.720 --> 49:18.560]  We're like, we're like raising a glass to the working man.
[49:18.980 --> 49:23.960]  We're like, we're giving it up to everyone who had to listen to their boss all week.
[49:24.140 --> 49:26.280]  We're saying, hell yeah, dude, you're done.
[49:26.380 --> 49:27.880]  We're a Coors commercial.
[49:28.540 --> 49:30.060]  Oh, yeah. Okay, I support that.
[49:30.400 --> 49:32.640]  Here's to you, Mr. 5pm man.
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.660]  Can I add a cherry to this experience? I'm excited. I'm just thinking about this.
[49:36.880 --> 49:37.640]  Oh, yeah, add the cherry.
[49:38.380 --> 49:40.640]  It's a three-day weekend. It's a long weekend.
[49:40.840 --> 49:42.740]  It's a Friday going into a three-day.
[49:43.540 --> 49:44.960]  Oh, that's better.
[49:45.620 --> 49:49.820]  There was one cool thing that they did in the Army that I got to give them credit for,
[49:49.960 --> 49:51.260]  that I always thought was so badass.
[49:51.760 --> 49:52.980]  There was a rule when I was at...
[49:52.980 --> 49:55.980]  Yeah, well, there's two cool things they did in the Army that I got to give them credit for.
[49:56.040 --> 49:57.060]  One is obviously nukes.
[49:57.260 --> 50:00.620]  The second one is there was a policy when I was at Fort Hood.
[50:00.720 --> 50:02.560]  I don't know if it was Army-wide, but it was when I was there
[50:03.520 --> 50:06.300]  that every three-day weekend was a four-day weekend.
[50:06.860 --> 50:11.080]  And so if you got Friday or Monday off, they gave you the other day off too.
[50:11.320 --> 50:12.320]  That's amazing.
[50:13.220 --> 50:14.020]  That's awesome.
[50:14.240 --> 50:15.480]  It was so fucking cool.
[50:16.020 --> 50:18.800]  That should be worldwide. There's no reason.
[50:19.100 --> 50:20.900]  We should only be working four days anyway.
[50:21.160 --> 50:24.620]  But like, dude, every three-day weekend should be a four-day weekend.
[50:24.740 --> 50:26.360]  You should tell your boss to go fuck himself.
[50:26.740 --> 50:28.120]  And then, oh, that rocks.
[50:28.340 --> 50:30.920]  It is amazing how far that goes too.
[50:31.140 --> 50:34.360]  Like, you will put up with a lot of being at PT at 6 a.m.
[50:34.420 --> 50:37.820]  when you know there's a four-day weekend coming up two weeks from now or three weeks from now.
[50:37.920 --> 50:38.680]  It's fucking...
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.480]  It's like gold in your hand, man.
[50:41.480 --> 50:42.020]  Absolutely.
[50:43.220 --> 50:43.700]  Fuck.
[50:44.040 --> 50:47.320]  Andrew, what job did you have where you were excited to clock off at 5.01?
[50:47.940 --> 50:49.160]  I was working a warehouse.
[50:49.760 --> 50:51.100]  Oh, the one where you...
[50:51.100 --> 50:53.540]  I was the only person in an electrical warehouse that I had to...
[50:53.540 --> 50:53.760]  Oh.
[50:54.020 --> 50:55.700]  Yeah. It's exhausting.
[50:56.000 --> 50:57.020]  Your packaging and...
[50:57.020 --> 50:59.200]  Was it a tiring job or were you constantly looking at the clock?
[50:59.740 --> 51:02.500]  Oh, physically so exhausting.
[51:02.840 --> 51:03.100]  Oh.
[51:03.380 --> 51:03.900]  So tiring.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.580]  It was... I only ended up working there for like three months,
[51:06.580 --> 51:14.420]  but I would wake up at 5.00 a.m., get there by 6.00, and then as soon as I left,
[51:14.540 --> 51:19.660]  I would play games for like two hours and then I'd fall asleep at 8.00 p.m. every day.
[51:20.520 --> 51:23.400]  Just zero... I had zero life outside of the weekend.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.720]  It was just, yeah, draining.
[51:27.160 --> 51:29.820]  Yeah, there are a lot of jobs out there that prevent regular living.
[51:30.560 --> 51:33.540]  Yes. I'm just... I can see now...
[51:33.540 --> 51:40.260]  Specific memory of a Don't Stop Believin' was playing on the radio in the warehouse,
[51:40.780 --> 51:47.280]  walking out on a Friday. Long weekend. Oh, great feeling. Great feeling.
[51:47.740 --> 51:52.500]  Did you ever work jobs where on your last day, people would beat the shit out of you?
[51:53.900 --> 51:55.400]  What the fuck?
[51:56.780 --> 51:57.940]  Yeah, Nick, you ever do that?
[51:58.640 --> 52:06.680]  I know this story, and no. We did shit kind of like that in the army, but not really, no.
[52:07.560 --> 52:08.800]  Explain, what happened?
[52:09.060 --> 52:14.480]  Well, at the supermarket I worked at, Waitrose, on the last day of everyone's job,
[52:14.560 --> 52:19.380]  they would just get like rotten food and shit thrown at them.
[52:19.700 --> 52:22.220]  What are you talking about?
[52:22.480 --> 52:26.320]  And on my last day, I tried to sneak out before it happened.
[52:27.160 --> 52:31.540]  So I like tried to leave like 20 minutes early and people got ahead of me.
[52:31.620 --> 52:32.880]  They were one step ahead of me the whole time.
[52:33.200 --> 52:38.480]  I got picked up and thrown in one of the skips and then pelted with fish guts.
[52:38.840 --> 52:40.200]  Oh, God.
[52:40.520 --> 52:43.940]  And eggs. And they told them they do that to everybody.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.540]  It's not just you.
[52:46.080 --> 52:47.580]  That's the lie they told you?
[52:47.660 --> 52:48.920]  I did see it happen to other people.
[52:49.140 --> 52:49.780]  Oh, my God.
[52:52.060 --> 52:53.160]  Oh, man, that's brutal.
[52:54.200 --> 52:57.500]  Yeah, that didn't happen to me.
[52:58.760 --> 53:02.700]  They like to do like tough guy shit in the army, but not like that.
[53:03.740 --> 53:04.600]  That's funny.
[53:05.580 --> 53:14.360]  Speaking of good feelings, I played Sea of Thieves the other night and I had another moment
[53:15.020 --> 53:18.120]  where I was trying to wrap up because it's the end of a season
[53:18.120 --> 53:21.700]  and I wanted a specific thing in their battle pass.
[53:23.160 --> 53:27.440]  And is is a little I need to like two levels in a night, essentially.
[53:27.660 --> 53:28.840]  So I was trying to maximize it.
[53:28.980 --> 53:31.920]  And there are these specific forts that give a lot of loot.
[53:32.500 --> 53:34.880]  It's the same thing I think I talked about last time I talked about Sea of Thieves.
[53:35.260 --> 53:38.760]  And so I went to one because I figured I'd be able to get a good chunk of XP.
[53:39.420 --> 53:41.020]  And there was a boat there already.
[53:41.660 --> 53:44.300]  And I looked at him from a distance from my telescope and it was like,
[53:44.340 --> 53:45.720]  this is who's captaining it.
[53:45.860 --> 53:49.020]  And they're like, faction is leave me alone.
[53:49.460 --> 53:50.660]  And I thought, that's great.
[53:50.660 --> 53:52.420]  I don't they don't want to be fucked with.
[53:52.940 --> 53:54.040]  I don't want to fuck with anybody.
[53:54.360 --> 53:55.560]  I'm just trying to get some XP.
[53:55.800 --> 53:56.920]  Let's make an alliance.
[53:57.000 --> 53:57.880]  Let's be friends.
[53:58.160 --> 53:59.080]  We can share this.
[53:59.260 --> 54:03.180]  So I was like very clear communicating in game like, hey, friendly, friendly.
[54:03.300 --> 54:04.720]  Let's truce alliance.
[54:05.260 --> 54:07.500]  And they immediately started shooting me with cannonballs.
[54:07.980 --> 54:10.320]  And so I moved on, but they followed me.
[54:10.420 --> 54:12.300]  And I was like, I'm going to give this one last try.
[54:12.320 --> 54:16.420]  I'm going to be just painfully obvious that I am friendly.
[54:16.720 --> 54:19.700]  And so I do it again and they start heading towards me.
[54:19.700 --> 54:20.660]  I drop anchor.
[54:20.860 --> 54:21.780]  I raise my sails.
[54:21.940 --> 54:26.560]  I'm not a threat and I'm playing music and they decide to sink me anyway.
[54:26.820 --> 54:27.720]  And I have nothing.
[54:27.840 --> 54:28.700]  I have nothing in my boat.
[54:29.840 --> 54:31.200]  There's no reason for them to do this.
[54:31.460 --> 54:34.900]  So I decide I'm going to try to fuck with them, try to get revenge.
[54:35.320 --> 54:36.740]  And so I respawn.
[54:37.080 --> 54:41.280]  I end up on an island with a rowboat and I just I see that skull in the sky
[54:41.280 --> 54:43.960]  and I'm rowboating as hard as I can.
[54:44.460 --> 54:47.120]  And I know last time I had one of these type of things happen.
[54:47.200 --> 54:47.840]  Gavin, you brought up.
[54:47.960 --> 54:48.680]  Did I have footage of it?
[54:48.680 --> 54:50.540]  I started recording at this point.
[54:50.640 --> 54:53.740]  I have some clips of the stuff before I started recording.
[54:53.840 --> 54:54.780]  I'm rowboating.
[54:55.180 --> 54:57.380]  I get pretty close, but I don't want to get too close
[54:57.380 --> 54:59.820]  because I don't want them to know that there's a rowboat.
[54:59.860 --> 55:04.120]  So I get out and I swim and I see they're fighting the final boss for it,
[55:04.120 --> 55:05.680]  which is like this is perfect.
[55:06.120 --> 55:07.240]  They're going to be so distracted.
[55:07.720 --> 55:09.120]  I sneak up on their boat.
[55:09.820 --> 55:13.260]  The problem is their ship is painted completely black
[55:13.260 --> 55:17.520]  and I am dressed in brown to like blend in in wood.
[55:17.520 --> 55:18.920]  And I start panicking.
[55:19.360 --> 55:23.140]  So I run into the bottom and I go through their clothing chests
[55:23.140 --> 55:26.680]  and I put on as many black pieces of clothing as I can.
[55:26.780 --> 55:27.780]  So I can stuff up.
[55:28.000 --> 55:29.680]  But I'm like freaking out because it's like,
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.900]  oh, they're going to die and respawn and see me.
[55:31.980 --> 55:32.820]  Oh, fuck.
[55:33.100 --> 55:33.820]  So I'm rushing.
[55:34.060 --> 55:36.120]  I get all my black clothes on.
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.740]  I lay down in my hiding spot and I have a perfect view of everything.
[55:41.200 --> 55:42.360]  It is great.
[55:42.760 --> 55:43.580]  I'm just watching.
[55:43.980 --> 55:46.040]  I get credit for beating the fort.
[55:46.080 --> 55:46.940]  I get that XP.
[55:46.940 --> 55:48.280]  I was looking for.
[55:48.720 --> 55:51.760]  And like last time, my plan is I'm just going to wait
[55:52.140 --> 55:55.660]  until they have that gunpowder keg that will blow up their whole ship.
[55:55.760 --> 55:57.120]  And then I'm going to light it on fire.
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.240]  We're just going to wait.
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.940]  And this is what these fuckers get.
[56:00.120 --> 56:01.460]  We could have all shared the loot.
[56:01.700 --> 56:04.100]  It could have been all good, but they had to be assholes.
[56:04.220 --> 56:06.380]  So now nobody's going to get any of the treasure.
[56:06.620 --> 56:09.340]  And so I'm just laying there and they're stacking.
[56:09.560 --> 56:10.340]  They're going back and forth.
[56:10.360 --> 56:11.220]  They're grabbing the loot.
[56:11.440 --> 56:14.100]  They're putting it in a position to harpoon it, to make it easier.
[56:14.560 --> 56:15.520]  And they're going back and forth.
[56:15.520 --> 56:20.720]  And then all of a sudden they start like telescoping constantly.
[56:21.180 --> 56:22.560]  And I'm like, are they looking for me?
[56:22.580 --> 56:24.000]  Like they knew that they fought me.
[56:24.260 --> 56:25.320]  This is kind of weird.
[56:25.640 --> 56:27.500]  And they're looking at my general area.
[56:27.580 --> 56:30.840]  So now I'm getting paranoid of like, do they see me on the boat?
[56:31.020 --> 56:32.020]  Because they're really good.
[56:32.280 --> 56:33.160]  They're very accurate.
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.640]  So it's like they've clearly played a lot.
[56:35.860 --> 56:37.220]  And I don't know what's going on.
[56:37.740 --> 56:38.580]  So I start scanning.
[56:38.680 --> 56:40.320]  I see I can't see the robot in the distance.
[56:40.380 --> 56:41.160]  So I feel pretty good.
[56:41.580 --> 56:43.240]  I think they would attack me if I was there.
[56:43.320 --> 56:44.860]  So they must they're just being cautious.
[56:44.860 --> 56:46.780]  I chalk it up to them being paranoid.
[56:47.680 --> 56:49.240]  And I'm just kind of hanging out.
[56:49.660 --> 56:52.760]  And then one of them runs and starts swimming on their ship.
[56:52.820 --> 56:53.860]  And they get into the ship.
[56:54.040 --> 56:57.100]  And they're like getting ready to raise anchor and all that to move to get the loot.
[56:57.380 --> 56:59.420]  And then a second sloop comes by.
[57:00.160 --> 57:02.520]  But there's no reaction by them.
[57:02.600 --> 57:03.460]  They're in game chat.
[57:03.480 --> 57:06.600]  So I can hear them whenever they're around and talking.
[57:07.420 --> 57:08.980]  So they're moving their ship.
[57:09.060 --> 57:09.960]  And then the second sloop.
[57:10.060 --> 57:12.000]  And I'm like, these motherfuckers, how are they?
[57:12.340 --> 57:14.520]  Do they like know each other and they're on the same server?
[57:14.860 --> 57:15.780]  What's going on?
[57:16.260 --> 57:20.020]  And then all of a sudden, I hear in the distance, there's somebody on our boat.
[57:20.720 --> 57:23.120]  It was it was not them.
[57:23.240 --> 57:29.140]  The guy on the boat was a third party that was also, I guess, camping the scenario out,
[57:29.240 --> 57:31.760]  but didn't know that I was on the boat already.
[57:32.640 --> 57:36.860]  So they start trying to steal the boat and going away.
[57:37.340 --> 57:39.640]  They a bomb goes off on the ship.
[57:39.680 --> 57:40.320]  It like explode.
[57:40.400 --> 57:41.920]  I don't know if a cannon hits us or what.
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.160]  But I get launched off the ship with the guy that was trying to hijack it.
[57:47.540 --> 57:48.820]  I swim away.
[57:49.180 --> 57:52.420]  The hijacker snipes at me thinking I'm one of them.
[57:52.760 --> 57:56.880]  Has no clue that I'm just a third party that is observing this.
[57:57.020 --> 57:58.660]  I run and I hide.
[57:58.960 --> 58:01.080]  They kill the guy that was hijacking.
[58:01.180 --> 58:02.260]  The other boat goes away.
[58:02.680 --> 58:06.840]  And I can hear them on comms the whole time being like, even if they would have got us,
[58:07.060 --> 58:09.820]  we buried the treasure that we cared most about.
[58:09.860 --> 58:10.740]  So we're fine.
[58:10.740 --> 58:11.940]  Let's dig this up.
[58:12.180 --> 58:13.340]  Let's get out of here.
[58:13.640 --> 58:17.920]  And I'm just watching them with a little gunpowder barrel in my hand.
[58:18.040 --> 58:19.800]  And the guy's like, fuck that.
[58:19.880 --> 58:20.740]  Let's just leave.
[58:20.760 --> 58:21.300]  Let's go.
[58:21.860 --> 58:24.740]  And the guy said, no, we are not leaving without this.
[58:24.900 --> 58:28.440]  If you leave without this, I'm swimming it to the outpost myself.
[58:28.920 --> 58:30.420]  We are not going without this thing.
[58:30.680 --> 58:32.680]  So he digs it up and he brings it in.
[58:32.900 --> 58:36.720]  And I could just hear them talking while I'm getting closer of my gunpowder barrel
[58:36.720 --> 58:39.100]  of them being like, OK, now let's go.
[58:39.100 --> 58:40.420]  Now we can leave.
[58:40.580 --> 58:42.200]  And I swam underneath their boat.
[58:42.380 --> 58:45.060]  I let go of the gunpowder barrel and it floats up and it hits the bottom.
[58:45.320 --> 58:47.900]  And their boat must have been filled with explosives.
[58:50.320 --> 58:54.400]  90% of my health goes away and just flames launch out the boat.
[58:54.540 --> 58:56.200]  It immediately sinks.
[58:56.360 --> 58:58.620]  And I can just hear him yelling at his friend.
[58:58.780 --> 59:00.560]  I told you we should have left.
[59:00.900 --> 59:01.820]  I told you.
[59:02.360 --> 59:05.020]  And then they're dead.
[59:05.260 --> 59:05.780]  It sinks.
[59:05.880 --> 59:06.460]  I go on their boat.
[59:06.540 --> 59:07.240]  Watch it happens.
[59:07.420 --> 59:08.640]  Leave. Go back to the island.
[59:08.640 --> 59:13.360]  Now the original ship that was fucking with them slowly comes back and is like,
[59:13.560 --> 59:14.280]  what is happening?
[59:14.640 --> 59:16.620]  Why is all of the treasure in the water?
[59:16.740 --> 59:17.320]  And they sunk.
[59:17.600 --> 59:18.460]  What happened?
[59:19.600 --> 59:22.780]  And I run around the island looking for another gunpowder.
[59:22.860 --> 59:23.840]  There is unfortunately none.
[59:23.900 --> 59:25.040]  So I can't really fuck with them.
[59:25.260 --> 59:29.780]  I bury a few things of treasure and then I run out and I just start jumping on the beach
[59:29.780 --> 59:30.640]  and they gun me down.
[59:31.100 --> 59:34.560]  And so I think the random third party that did nothing ended up with all the treasure.
[59:34.560 --> 59:39.600]  But it is such a good feeling in that game to be like, hey, let's be friends.
[59:39.660 --> 59:42.440]  Let's get all this loot together and then be like, no, fuck you.
[59:42.760 --> 59:44.260]  And then the ruin it for those people.
[59:44.640 --> 59:46.160]  Oh, so good.
[59:46.600 --> 59:50.520]  It just reminds me of like a bank heist where people slowly break it in and then another
[59:50.520 --> 59:52.220]  crew comes crashing through the ceiling.
[59:52.380 --> 59:53.240]  Yeah, it was.
[59:53.580 --> 59:57.420]  I was so confused when I heard they're on our ship and I was like, oh, fuck.
[59:57.440 --> 59:58.120]  He knows I'm here.
[59:58.140 --> 01:00:02.900]  And then realizing, oh, wait, the guy on the boat that's controlling it isn't part of the
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.120]  crew.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.260]  This is another guy.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:05.780]  Unrelated ship.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.840]  It was insane.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.380]  And I recorded all of it.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.420]  So I don't know if we want to like clip it or do something with that footage.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.300]  But absolutely.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.920]  Maybe we can put it at the end of the video of the episode.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.200]  Yeah, whatever works.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.080]  But that'd be cool if we had it playing under as Andrew's talking about it.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.280]  Oh, yeah.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.940]  Yeah, if it lines up, we could do that.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.420]  Yeah, that would be really great.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.760]  And I mean, I'm sure we could make it work, but that'd be a cool little piece of supplemental
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.040]  content, too, that you could put on social.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:34.400]  That reminds me, we really got to get back and play that game, though.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.700]  I think that game is perfect for videos.
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.660]  We played it once.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.980]  I don't think that video has even come out yet.
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.020]  That was close to around the time that might have been recorded before the end of the company.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:45.820]  Even it was a while.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.560]  It was so long ago.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.640]  I think it was because I think me and Nick were on old Xboxes.
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.080]  I just want to play more.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:55.660]  I want to play different games and identify which ones Eric argues with Nick.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.360]  Yeah, like Pico Park.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.140]  They were arguing so much.
[01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:02.760]  I didn't know what they were even arguing about.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:07.320]  At one point, at one point, Eric was like, you have to make a Tetris, a Tetris.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.380]  You got to make a Tetris.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.860]  And Nick was like, what are you talking about?
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.240]  Yeah, you have to eliminate the lines.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]  So Tetris is, I was right.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.280]  And you have to do...
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.840]  That's not what Tetris is.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.960]  Yeah, no, it's eliminating the lines.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.100]  Hit block of four.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.820]  That's what it is.
[01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:19.460]  That's what we had to do it.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.100]  What do you mean a block of four?
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:20.800]  You had to do it twice.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:21.500]  Four.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.640]  Four is Tetris is four.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.980]  Four is the grits that you eliminate.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.220]  So yeah, we had to get ten.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.160]  So we had to do it twice and then two more.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.120]  So we had to get Tetrises.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:30.680]  You just had to get ten total.
[01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.180]  Did you guys see that guy that got the sunburn?
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.140]  Yeah.
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:36.820]  Did we?
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.000]  I don't think we did.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:38.280]  Did we?
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:38.700]  We did.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:40.820]  Maybe we talked about it off camera.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.320]  Yeah, I think we talked about it off camera.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:45.560]  First off, don't fuck around with sunburns.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.520]  You'll get cancer.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.180]  Wear sunscreen.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.240]  But secondly...
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:49.500]  Oh my God.
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.120]  That's very funny.
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:55.720]  And thirdly, it's like the ultimate fuckface because that's not a podcast anymore.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.500]  That's not...
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.360]  Yeah, that doesn't exist.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:01:59.080]  No, that's still who we are.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:01:59.660]  Our core.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:00.480]  That's true.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:00.960]  It is.
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.400]  That's the most amazing video.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:03.660]  Oh, it was in Key West?
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.200]  Yeah, as he went and walked in front of the camera.
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:10.200]  The resolution of the camera isn't great.
[01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.620]  It looks like Fyikmo.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.880]  Well, that's my favorite podcast.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.880]  That looks closer to the busted hat than it does to our actual logo.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.060]  That's a very, very funny thing to do.
[01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.600]  But seriously, wear sunscreen.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.180]  I'm excited about...
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.400]  I don't want anybody getting skin cancer and blaming us.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.640]  No, absolutely not.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.200]  The new update that came out today in Sea of Thieves added a super boat that is like
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.320]  anybody on the map can take it, but it's originally controlled by AI.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:50.480]  And it's the most powerful ship in the game.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:54.620]  And the idea being that like you take it and then you just ride around and fuck up other
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.300]  crews with it.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.840]  I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.060]  Have you attempted yet?
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:01.800]  No, and literally the update came out today and we've been busy all morning.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.380]  So yeah, we haven't had a chance.
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:05.080]  Excited to play it, though.
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.380]  Hey, can I ask you guys a question?
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.620]  Yeah, I've been getting up pretty early these days.
[01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.560]  Something about the way the light hits the new house.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.700]  It just I've been waking up naturally, like 630 in the morning.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:20.460]  So I've been watching a ton of local news with my coffee in the morning, and I don't
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.160]  really have a preference on on which channel.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:23.900]  So I bounce around.
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:29.900]  Why in 2024 are all traffic and weather cams 240p?
[01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:34.480]  It is 20 fucking 24.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:40.680]  Like, can we do some sort of a fund to get GoPros for all the local news stations in
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.100]  America?
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:48.240]  The shittiest cameras on Earth are still in use at our news channels.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.740]  I mean, at this point, everyone watching has better equipment than that.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:53.360]  Why don't they just rent out?
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.420]  Like, I'll point my camera at the weather.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.380]  I don't give a shit.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.000]  Use me.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.080]  Pay me five bucks a day and I'll film the weather for you.
[01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.500]  No kidding.
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.980]  I can yeah, I can set up a camera on a stick to shoot the traffic.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.040]  No problem.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.200]  1080p immediately.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.080]  Promise.
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.300]  I'll do 8K traffic.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:11.780]  Wait, wait.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.680]  Okay, can we do Gavin?
[01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.920]  Can I pay you five dollars to shoot the weather?
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:21.040]  And can we make the weather channel, which isn't about giving temperatures, but it's
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.880]  a viewing of what the current weather is?
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.160]  I have to be pretty local.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.320]  Yeah.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.180]  Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.680]  I want to do the weather channel, but it's not helpful.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:31.840]  It's just weather.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.740]  It's just the sun.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.420]  It's just wind.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:36.920]  Just the sun.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.280]  That actually is probably a bad channel.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.060]  Just the sun.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.920]  All sun, all the time.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.900]  You flip to it and it's just a camera pointed directly at the sun.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.180]  Look through the viewfinder, get your retina burned off.
[01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:54.640]  Okay, never mind.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.100]  We can scrap the weather channel.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:02.900]  Hey, I had an idea for a new draft we could do the other day that I thought you guys might like.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:07.920]  It would be probably a Patreon only one because it'd be full, chock full of licensed stuff.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:11.840]  But what if we did a draft of news flubs?
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.200]  Oh, well, what about just a flub draft?
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.160]  Looks like a flub draft.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.580]  For in my head, it's always on news stations.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:21.560]  Yeah, what if we just did a flub draft?
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.160]  Oh, I love that.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:24.620]  I think that could be a lot of fun.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.320]  I think it'd be fun to do research for.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.800]  Maybe we can record that at the same time as the one we didn't do last time.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.180]  Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.680]  Yeah, I really want us to do a best summer things draft.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.500]  I think that would be fun.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.960]  Summer activities, wasn't it?
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:38.900]  Summer activities, yeah.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:40.900]  Oh, right.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:43.000]  We should do it before summer is over.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:43.760]  Exactly.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:45.080]  Yeah, let's line that up, Sim.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.860]  Let's end this podcast so we can line that up soon.
[01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:48.840]  Okay.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.100]  Obviously, I'm doing Eric's job.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.700]  He's watching another Padres game.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:54.980]  We didn't have to get.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.620]  No, no, I already said we should wrap this one up.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.380]  I'm trying to let you guys get to it.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.400]  Oh, I didn't see it.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:00.800]  I'm sorry.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:01.420]  It was between.
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.160]  Oh, interesting.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.600]  Well, you know what?
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.440]  Hey, Andrew, apology barely accepted.
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.260]  Oh, I see it here, too.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:09.280]  He said that he did.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.180]  He said we should wrap this up.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.400]  It was buried under the photo.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.260]  Hard to see.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.620]  Sandwiched between the red line and the photo.
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:16.840]  Yeah, that's why the apology was barely accepted.
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.020]  But accepted.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:19.600]  Absolutely.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.160]  The fact that it's barely accepted is really irrelevant.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.860]  As long as it's accepted is all that's required for the apology.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.640]  We just needed 10 lines.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:29.760]  We didn't need two Tetrises and two lines.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.100]  Just any 10 would have done.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.460]  What about 60 laps?
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.920]  Two Tetrises and then two more and then we were done.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.700]  Easy as that.
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.960]  Guys, thank you so much for listening.

[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.480]  Can you believe all of the videos that we've recorded and haven't put out yet?
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:03.080]  Well, I imagine they can't.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.460]  They don't know about them, do they?
[01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:05.040]  Right.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.720]  Yeah, that's why I'm asking if they can imagine them.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.180]  Oh, yeah, I just I just want to say, speaking of fun falcon activities,
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:18.420]  you missed this month's because we did it on Monday of when this recorded doing a draft,
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:23.880]  building a Sloppy Joes card for a Sloppy Joes stream on Thursday.
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.300]  I believe tomorrow.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.060]  Yeah.
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:27.060]  When you hear this.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.220]  Is that right?
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:30.740]  When is the Sloppy Joes stream for next week?
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.780]  Everybody's waiting.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.060]  I'm looking at the calendar.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:34.460]  Hold on.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.720]  Maybe it's not on our calendar because we had to wait for Gavin.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.660]  So you're announcing it before we landed on when we were going to.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.680]  Gavin, you were around on Monday?
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.520]  Uh, sure.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.420]  You were around on Thursday?
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:48.340]  Yep.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.580]  Nailed it.
[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:50.940]  There we go.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.300]  Could we not do Friday?
[01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:54.260]  Whatever.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.100]  I don't care.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.100]  I thought it was Thursday.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.180]  I mean, you're the one that said it.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:57.680]  You obviously care.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.280]  Let's do Friday.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:58.900]  Friday.
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:01.460]  Not what time are we doing it at?
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:03.280]  Friday is better.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.260]  What about 5.01 Hawaii time?
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:07.900]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.640]  When is Sloppy Clocks?
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.200]  11.15.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.220]  So what is that in Hawaii time?
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.560]  It would be 10.15 our time.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.140]  That would...
[01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:14.520]  Oh, okay.
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:15.920]  So why would we do it Hawaii time?
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.720]  I was just trying to think of somewhere.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:18.820]  It would be five o'clock.
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.620]  Maybe we'll do it at like 9 p.m. our time, Friday night?
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.240]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.520]  Uh, August 2nd?

[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.020]  Sounds good to me.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.580]  And we got it locked in.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.220]  See how that worked?
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.080]  We'll see you there.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:34.780]  Good work by me.
