[00:00.000 --> 00:02.200]  What's the best place to get a sunburn?
[00:02.780 --> 00:04.340]  The best place to get a sunburn?
[00:04.500 --> 00:07.260]  The best place. Yeah, not the worst. The best.
[00:07.760 --> 00:08.500]  Probably your neck.
[00:09.500 --> 00:15.520]  You think that I... I'm a crinkled neck sleeper. I don't think that would work well for me.
[00:16.200 --> 00:17.680]  All right. Hold that thought.
[00:18.180 --> 00:23.940]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. It's a baker's dozen.
[00:24.140 --> 00:28.940]  Eric reminded me this is episode 13. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always,
[00:28.940 --> 00:36.740]  Andrew Panton, Eric Baudour, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, in order of importance,
[00:36.860 --> 00:39.380]  but from odd to even numbers. How's everybody doing?
[00:39.560 --> 00:42.800]  Andrew, you were asking what the best place to get a sunburn is.
[00:43.360 --> 00:46.640]  I'm just, yeah, because obviously there's a lot of bad places. I was trying to think
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.920]  of what would be a good place to get one. Lower back, mate? Nah, no.
[00:51.180 --> 00:53.420]  Lower back's not bad.
[00:54.320 --> 00:54.940]  Lower stomach.
[00:55.320 --> 00:56.380]  Shoulders. I would say shoulders.
[00:56.380 --> 01:03.220]  I often film in that, uh, quarry and it's got very sort of chalky white ground. And if I don't
[01:03.220 --> 01:08.700]  put sunscreen on the, on my undercarriage, it like gets on my inner thighs. Like the sun bounces
[01:08.700 --> 01:12.920]  off the ground up my shorts. That would be bad. That would be a bad spot for a burn.
[01:13.220 --> 01:15.200]  It's pretty rough. It's in the chafe area.
[01:16.240 --> 01:18.040]  I don't want anything in the chafe area.
[01:18.300 --> 01:24.460]  What's the worst sunburn you've ever had? Like, have you ever had like a big puss-filled blister?
[01:26.380 --> 01:27.660]  I have. Oh yeah.
[01:27.920 --> 01:31.940]  You and I went different places. I was thinking it'd be really funny to make a skin suit.
[01:32.340 --> 01:34.600]  Like if you burn your entire body.
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.440]  That is really funny.
[01:36.400 --> 01:37.440]  What do you mean?
[01:37.640 --> 01:38.440]  Fucking psycho.
[01:39.440 --> 01:42.820]  Well, if let's say your whole body burns and it peels.
[01:43.040 --> 01:44.360]  Just be like a big walking blister.
[01:44.620 --> 01:50.380]  Yeah. Like how your skin peels like Christian Bale, an American psycho with the face mask,
[01:50.400 --> 01:51.780]  but it's just your whole body.
[01:52.520 --> 01:57.340]  Oh, I'm imagining like a chalk outline of a crime scene, but it's just you skin.
[01:57.500 --> 02:00.180]  Like a snake. Like how a snake shed skin.
[02:00.520 --> 02:01.280]  That's horrible.
[02:01.340 --> 02:03.860]  The human shakes, or snake, not shake.
[02:05.260 --> 02:08.160]  I got liquids on the brain.
[02:08.760 --> 02:13.800]  I'm drinking lightly sparkling water, which I didn't know was a thing.
[02:14.060 --> 02:15.820]  And it's terrible. I don't like it.
[02:15.820 --> 02:17.700]  So you've like soda streamed and left it overnight?
[02:18.180 --> 02:20.800]  No, it's a, it's a bottled product.
[02:20.800 --> 02:23.800]  It's a canned product that is lightly sparkling.
[02:24.280 --> 02:27.040]  Which I didn't know that you could have a variety of sparkling types.
[02:27.340 --> 02:29.800]  It's got to be all or nothing when it comes to fizz.
[02:30.180 --> 02:32.400]  I, yeah, who wants less fizz?
[02:32.940 --> 02:34.780]  If I want fizz, give me all the fizz.
[02:35.860 --> 02:37.720]  This just feels flat, like you said.
[02:38.320 --> 02:39.860]  Yeah, I think fizz is all or nothing, right?
[02:39.900 --> 02:42.360]  It's all gas, no brakes with fizz.
[02:43.100 --> 02:43.920]  I'd agree with that.
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.180]  As a matter of fact, if it's just a little bit of fizz, it makes me think it's a bad strawberry.
[02:49.180 --> 02:50.960]  Yes, yeah, absolutely.
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.460]  You know how strawberry goes bad and it's just like a little bit of fizz?
[02:54.680 --> 02:54.920]  Yeah.
[02:56.100 --> 03:01.400]  The fact that there are other brands making lightly sparkling water deeply concerns me.
[03:01.780 --> 03:04.320]  This shouldn't, I was hoping it was just this weird.
[03:04.720 --> 03:06.860]  This is a Chateau water.
[03:07.040 --> 03:10.120]  I thought it was just fancy, a fancy water thing.
[03:10.620 --> 03:13.340]  That's a company who found out that the CO2
[03:13.340 --> 03:16.080]  cartridges started to cost way more money after the pandemic
[03:16.080 --> 03:17.800]  and tried to figure out a creative solution.
[03:18.360 --> 03:19.740]  So they use less.
[03:20.700 --> 03:21.460]  This may be creative.
[03:21.720 --> 03:22.540]  It's not good.
[03:23.020 --> 03:23.720]  Would not recommend.
[03:24.760 --> 03:28.120]  I have a beverage dilemma that isn't even in my notes, but we're talking about beverages.
[03:28.860 --> 03:30.840]  I don't know what to do about...
[03:30.840 --> 03:35.160]  I have a drink in my fridge, had it in my fridge for about four months,
[03:35.800 --> 03:38.300]  and I don't know what to do about it because it's...
[03:38.300 --> 03:38.440]  So do I.
[03:39.060 --> 03:40.600]  No, well, probably.
[03:41.200 --> 03:43.460]  Yeah, before you even stop, you pour it down the sink.
[03:44.060 --> 03:45.120]  Here's the thing, though.
[03:45.260 --> 03:47.100]  This is what makes it a little bit of a wrinkle.
[03:47.100 --> 03:51.780]  It is a slush drink from a boba place.
[03:52.140 --> 03:53.520]  Oh, you got to drink it.
[03:53.800 --> 03:54.400]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:54.420 --> 03:55.300]  You got to drink it, dude.
[03:55.340 --> 03:55.620]  For sure.
[03:55.660 --> 03:56.580]  You don't want to throw that out.
[03:57.020 --> 03:57.640]  But here's the...
[03:57.640 --> 03:58.440]  Well, it's great.
[03:58.740 --> 03:58.920]  Yeah.
[03:59.040 --> 04:00.900]  First of all, great drink, as Eric is saying.
[04:01.300 --> 04:01.920]  It would hate...
[04:01.920 --> 04:05.180]  I'd hate to make it a waste, but this is where the dilemma comes in.
[04:05.360 --> 04:06.760]  They vacuum seal it.
[04:07.140 --> 04:09.500]  It's a vacuum sealed top in a cup.
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.120]  So it is as sealed as it can be.
[04:13.540 --> 04:16.220]  Isn't boba typically kind of milky?
[04:16.220 --> 04:17.480]  But it's not boba.
[04:17.600 --> 04:18.880]  It's like a slush drink.
[04:19.020 --> 04:19.700]  It's like a Slurpee.
[04:20.220 --> 04:24.640]  I imagine somebody took a slushie and then vacuum sealed it.
[04:24.960 --> 04:29.280]  But there might be some, like, strawberry puree.
[04:29.860 --> 04:32.980]  I don't know what their shelf life is on a puree.
[04:33.940 --> 04:34.640]  Oh, you got time.
[04:35.560 --> 04:36.880]  Why didn't you drink it at the time?
[04:37.900 --> 04:40.420]  Uh, I planned on drinking it the next day.
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.000]  And so I put it in my fridge and then I forgot it existed.
[04:44.000 --> 04:47.960]  And now I find it and I go, oh man, I'd hate to throw that away.
[04:48.100 --> 04:50.920]  But I don't know how this works.
[04:51.260 --> 04:52.540]  Because it's not in a bottle.
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.720]  If it was in a bottle, I would just drink it.
[04:54.780 --> 04:55.260]  It's fine.
[04:55.900 --> 04:58.380]  But it's in a cup that's been vacuum sealed.
[04:58.640 --> 05:00.820]  And I don't know the rules around that.
[05:01.240 --> 05:03.540]  How do you vacuum seal a cup?
[05:03.900 --> 05:06.580]  I don't think it's been vacuum sealed at all.
[05:07.120 --> 05:09.760]  I think it's just that somebody just pressed a lid on.
[05:10.200 --> 05:12.700]  Yeah, like if it's in a pouch that's vacuum sealed.
[05:13.120 --> 05:14.220]  How's it in a cup though?
[05:14.700 --> 05:15.900]  Is there a straw in it?
[05:16.340 --> 05:18.220]  No, you have to pierce the top.
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.480]  It's a sealed...
[05:19.480 --> 05:20.500]  So the top, okay.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.540]  Yeah, I mean, it sounds like...
[05:22.540 --> 05:24.340]  I mean, the way you're describing it and everything, Andrew,
[05:24.440 --> 05:25.500]  I think it's good to go, man.
[05:25.540 --> 05:27.020]  I think you could pop that thing open.
[05:27.260 --> 05:28.300]  Here, I'll take a photo.
[05:28.420 --> 05:29.560]  Eric's trying to kill you.
[05:29.660 --> 05:30.380]  Is there deer in it?
[05:31.180 --> 05:32.480]  Have a drink real quick, dude.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.360]  Yeah, there's no deer.
[05:33.380 --> 05:33.840]  There's no way.
[05:33.900 --> 05:35.540]  And even if there was, it's fine, dude.
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.380]  It sounds like it's sealed.
[05:36.820 --> 05:37.240]  It is.
[05:37.400 --> 05:38.660]  It couldn't be more sealed.
[05:39.340 --> 05:40.080]  Take the photo.
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.140]  Uh-huh.
[05:41.600 --> 05:43.120]  Are we doing Umidigi, or are we doing...
[05:43.120 --> 05:44.540]  Yeah, I was gonna say, is this the Umidigi bison?
[05:44.740 --> 05:46.160]  No, no, I'm on the...
[05:46.680 --> 05:47.180]  Soy milk.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.140]  Soy teriyaki phone, or whatever, the soy phone.
[05:51.380 --> 05:51.660]  What?
[05:52.680 --> 05:54.340]  The soy sauce phone, whatever.
[05:54.460 --> 05:55.440]  Yeah, he's got the soy sauce.
[05:56.320 --> 05:57.200]  Whatever the sauce...
[05:57.200 --> 05:58.940]  I don't remember what the sauce was that said...
[05:58.940 --> 05:59.560]  Soy oil.
[05:59.820 --> 06:01.440]  His phone is labeled with soy oil.
[06:02.000 --> 06:03.980]  Yeah, I'm on the soy phone.
[06:04.240 --> 06:04.920]  Soy oil phone.
[06:05.420 --> 06:07.100]  Here's the photo of the drink.
[06:08.300 --> 06:11.940]  This has been in my fridge for four or five months at this point.
[06:11.980 --> 06:12.380]  Oh, it's good.
[06:12.480 --> 06:13.580]  Oh, yeah, that's sealed.
[06:14.240 --> 06:14.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:14.800 --> 06:16.180]  It's super sealed.
[06:16.580 --> 06:18.640]  That's not vacuum sealed, that's just like heat sealed.
[06:18.740 --> 06:20.520]  That's like they've melted the lid on.
[06:20.960 --> 06:22.120]  There's air in there.
[06:22.520 --> 06:24.640]  It's way more sealed than I thought it was.
[06:25.580 --> 06:26.700]  There's an air gap.
[06:28.060 --> 06:29.460]  I don't think there is.
[06:29.560 --> 06:30.580]  Where would the air gap be?
[06:31.680 --> 06:32.560]  Where there's...
[06:33.480 --> 06:34.640]  Right above the liquid.
[06:35.000 --> 06:35.620]  That's air.
[06:35.980 --> 06:36.440]  That is air.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.860]  I see what you're saying.
[06:38.060 --> 06:38.140]  Okay.
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.080]  If it was vacuum sealed, the liquid would be the only thing in there.
[06:42.180 --> 06:42.760]  Got it.
[06:42.900 --> 06:43.300]  Understood.
[06:43.660 --> 06:43.980]  Thank you.
[06:44.040 --> 06:44.860]  That cleared up a lot.
[06:45.320 --> 06:50.260]  Now, Andrew, does this have boba balls in it?
[06:50.780 --> 06:52.220]  No, no balls.
[06:53.040 --> 06:54.180]  No boba in it.
[06:54.320 --> 06:54.720]  It is...
[06:54.720 --> 06:57.820]  Imagine, as I said, a slushie is where we start.
[06:57.840 --> 06:59.180]  So here's the deal.
[06:59.260 --> 07:03.740]  If you rip the top off and you see mold or mildew on the top, then you have your answer.
[07:03.740 --> 07:07.160]  If it looks fine, I'm going to guess it's fine.
[07:07.700 --> 07:09.880]  That's where I'm kind of at.
[07:09.920 --> 07:10.940]  I don't know about that.
[07:11.160 --> 07:11.800]  Because it's like...
[07:12.260 --> 07:14.140]  With milk, you do the whiff test, right?
[07:14.180 --> 07:16.100]  You give it a little huff and you can just tell.
[07:16.280 --> 07:20.140]  I don't know if that would smell bad, but it could still have a little bacteria in it.
[07:21.620 --> 07:22.000]  Can...
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.260]  Can we try at the end of this episode to see if, like, if you...
[07:26.260 --> 07:27.660]  I want you to think about it.
[07:27.740 --> 07:31.060]  But if you, like, you keep looking at it and you go, you know what?
[07:31.100 --> 07:32.580]  Now's the time at the end of this episode.
[07:32.580 --> 07:34.380]  You want to, like, give it a drink?
[07:34.620 --> 07:35.440]  If it's something that you want.
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.240]  I don't...
[07:36.240 --> 07:37.000]  I don't know.
[07:37.660 --> 07:38.520]  I don't know.
[07:39.620 --> 07:42.520]  Here, I'm going to post a photo of what it looks like when I got it.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.460]  Give it a contrast.
[07:44.580 --> 07:46.300]  It's almost like you intended for this experiment.
[07:46.420 --> 07:46.560]  Yeah.
[07:47.140 --> 07:48.900]  Take up a full picture of all your food.
[07:48.920 --> 07:50.000]  No, I just googled.
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.080]  I just googled where I got it from.
[07:52.280 --> 07:54.180]  It looks nothing like that anymore.
[07:55.820 --> 07:56.620]  Well, it's...
[07:56.620 --> 08:00.560]  But if you just melt that, I think it would look the exact same.
[08:01.160 --> 08:03.200]  Shouldn't a slushie be kept in the freezer?
[08:03.680 --> 08:04.960]  Or does that make it too cold?
[08:05.880 --> 08:06.440]  What do you mean?
[08:06.520 --> 08:08.200]  No, it would solidify.
[08:08.680 --> 08:09.080]  What?
[08:09.220 --> 08:10.840]  I think it needs to be kept in between.
[08:11.340 --> 08:11.700]  Yeah.
[08:12.360 --> 08:13.740]  In a device that doesn't exist.
[08:14.220 --> 08:14.680]  You need a slusher.
[08:14.680 --> 08:15.860]  It needs to be constantly broken.
[08:15.880 --> 08:16.440]  Yeah, a regulator box.
[08:17.440 --> 08:18.420]  It needs to be cold.
[08:18.480 --> 08:20.360]  It needs to be frozen, but stirred constantly.
[08:20.880 --> 08:21.280]  Yes.
[08:22.420 --> 08:22.820]  Exactly.
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.900]  I don't think a strawberry as an ingredient would last months.
[08:29.900 --> 08:30.780]  I agree.
[08:30.980 --> 08:32.780]  But I don't know if it's real strawberry.
[08:32.900 --> 08:37.620]  And if that's fresh, real strawberry, I think you have to walk away.
[08:38.240 --> 08:41.560]  If it's just flavoring, it might be okay.
[08:41.840 --> 08:43.440]  It's probably just really stale.
[08:43.660 --> 08:48.400]  Why don't you just rip that bad boy open and just take a deep whiff and see what you feel?
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.860]  You're the one that said that the whiff test would not work.
[08:52.500 --> 08:53.340]  It might work.
[08:53.440 --> 08:53.840]  It might work.
[08:53.900 --> 08:54.160]  I don't know.
[08:54.740 --> 08:55.980]  Eric's trying to kill you for sure, though.
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.180]  I wouldn't drink it.
[08:57.180 --> 08:57.560]  What do you mean?
[08:58.120 --> 09:01.780]  He's just asking if he can have a drink, and I'm saying, baby, that looks pretty good.
[09:01.960 --> 09:04.320]  Why do you want some of our company to die?
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.620]  No, no, not die.
[09:06.760 --> 09:08.540]  I just want him to have his nice drink.
[09:10.320 --> 09:14.200]  They don't have any ingredient list on their website as well.
[09:14.560 --> 09:15.900]  Well, it's strawberries.
[09:16.360 --> 09:16.480]  Not great.
[09:17.340 --> 09:17.780]  Water.
[09:18.920 --> 09:19.900]  It's frozen secrets.
[09:20.720 --> 09:23.260]  This, I guess, isn't on the menu anymore.
[09:23.560 --> 09:25.220]  So I'm looking at other slushes.
[09:25.400 --> 09:25.500]  What?
[09:25.680 --> 09:26.720]  So now it's valuable.
[09:27.560 --> 09:28.960]  Oh, wow.
[09:29.000 --> 09:29.800]  You can hang on to it.
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.240]  There might be people, collectors out there.
[09:31.260 --> 09:32.960]  It's factory sealed.
[09:33.320 --> 09:34.520]  Yeah, this is a...
[09:34.980 --> 09:36.620]  Factory sealed was what I was looking for.
[09:37.040 --> 09:37.760]  Not vacuum.
[09:38.080 --> 09:38.640]  Thank you.
[09:39.020 --> 09:39.960]  Yeah, it's factory sealed.
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.440]  Yeah, this could be a PSA 10 boba time.
[09:43.980 --> 09:44.140]  Yeah.
[09:44.560 --> 09:46.960]  I mean, it's definitely not from a factory, but it is sealed, yeah.
[09:47.760 --> 09:52.500]  It says on the honeydew slush, an icy blend of bold, fruity honeydew flavor,
[09:52.660 --> 09:57.300]  which makes me think there's no actual organic fruit.
[09:57.300 --> 09:58.720]  You're right, dude, then you're good.
[09:59.020 --> 10:00.300]  Like that's, yeah.
[10:00.680 --> 10:03.200]  But I don't trust it because then I go to...
[10:04.020 --> 10:06.280]  Oh, no, because then I go to passion fruit slush
[10:06.280 --> 10:09.280]  and it says a frosty combination of sweet and tart flavors.
[10:09.640 --> 10:12.820]  The perfect imbalance slush dotted with real passion fruit seeds.
[10:13.300 --> 10:13.620]  Uh-uh.
[10:13.860 --> 10:14.600]  That's real.
[10:15.500 --> 10:17.080]  That's the opposite of flavor.
[10:17.740 --> 10:18.560]  All those seeds.
[10:19.420 --> 10:20.360]  They would...
[10:20.360 --> 10:21.680]  Seeds last forever.
[10:22.080 --> 10:23.060]  Yeah, seeds keep, dude.
[10:23.300 --> 10:26.280]  I would have a passion fruit tree if that was what was in my...
[10:26.280 --> 10:27.940]  The seeds would have grown by now.
[10:28.160 --> 10:31.700]  I mean, you could take a passion fruit seed and freeze it for 100,000 years
[10:31.700 --> 10:33.660]  and thaw it out and plant it and it'd be fine.
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.320]  I gotta think three months in a fridge wouldn't do any damage to a seed.
[10:41.900 --> 10:43.140]  I guess I'll open it.
[10:44.120 --> 10:45.340]  I guess I'll open it.
[10:45.740 --> 10:47.000]  I'm really nervous about this.
[10:48.100 --> 10:48.800]  I'm not.
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.560]  Dude, I'm so glad you're doing this.
[10:50.600 --> 10:51.520]  I had fucking nothing.
[10:53.100 --> 10:54.420]  This isn't even in my notes.
[10:54.420 --> 10:56.780]  You have nothing after such a break?
[10:57.100 --> 10:58.320]  Oh, wait, we didn't have a break, did we?
[11:00.400 --> 11:01.940]  Nothing in our lives happened.
[11:02.100 --> 11:03.000]  It was a very uneventful...
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.860]  I got shit. I struggled. I stretched.
[11:05.020 --> 11:06.220]  But, you know, this is way better.
[11:06.580 --> 11:08.560]  I had a lot of stuff lying in my lap. That's all I'm saying.
[11:09.060 --> 11:11.840]  Dude, I saw some stuff laying in your yard the other day.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.540]  I'm in house hell. We'll get to it.
[11:15.440 --> 11:16.240]  What's happening, Andrew?
[11:18.360 --> 11:19.520]  I don't trust it.
[11:20.060 --> 11:21.080]  I don't trust this.
[11:21.260 --> 11:21.940]  Did you open it?
[11:21.940 --> 11:24.800]  Yeah, I'm peeling it now so I can get a better view.
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.240]  Get the old nostrils in there.
[11:28.260 --> 11:31.220]  I... did a little black cloud like a soul escape.
[11:31.900 --> 11:34.120]  Not that I noticed. It is a little dark in here.
[11:34.740 --> 11:35.140]  Let me see.
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.120]  Did you hear any noises? Demonic noises? High-pitched squeals or anything?
[11:41.560 --> 11:43.220]  It just... it smells like syrup.
[11:45.200 --> 11:46.680]  I don't see anything.
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.120]  Maybe... let me...
[11:48.800 --> 11:51.300]  Oh, shit. The lid just went fucking... goddammit.
[11:52.940 --> 11:54.520]  Fucking piece of shit.
[11:55.840 --> 11:58.120]  Lid. It's a fucking thing.
[11:58.860 --> 11:59.780]  Oh, don't spill! Don't spill!
[11:59.780 --> 12:01.820]  I love how he makes the simplest thing on earth hard.
[12:03.220 --> 12:07.780]  I... I have a huge problem with it just... with it standing liquid. I... I hate it.
[12:08.060 --> 12:10.240]  You know, like when you leave a bottle of water and then it all gets
[12:10.240 --> 12:13.660]  all drippy and condensate-y on the inside? It's repulsive.
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.540]  I left a half a glass of Pepsi out last night and when I saw it this morning,
[12:18.640 --> 12:21.180]  I got so fucking mad at myself because I was like,
[12:21.180 --> 12:24.880]  I can't drink that. It's gross now. And I just wasted a half a glass of Pepsi.
[12:24.980 --> 12:27.960]  And I'm going to want that Pepsi later on today, like right now, for instance,
[12:28.040 --> 12:30.920]  and I won't have it because I had to pour it down the fucking drain like an idiot.
[12:31.280 --> 12:32.320]  Was it the last of your Pepsi?
[12:33.100 --> 12:33.460]  Yes.
[12:36.760 --> 12:37.120]  Interesting.
[12:37.960 --> 12:38.220]  Yeah.
[12:38.800 --> 12:42.220]  I can smell strawberry in the air now that I fully removed the lid.
[12:43.160 --> 12:44.220]  That's a good sign.
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.760]  There's a sweetness in the air that wasn't... that's definitely strawberry.
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.120]  I think that's all it's good for. It's an air freshener, but I'd call it there.
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.840]  Also, like in terms of drinking it or not, if there's harmful mold in it,
[12:57.980 --> 13:02.000]  you just release those spores into the air and you're now breathing them into
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.300]  your body and your lungs. So you're going to get it either way.
[13:04.460 --> 13:07.360]  This is how The Last of Us started. I got the spores in me now.
[13:07.540 --> 13:10.080]  Looking at this picture, you've just taken a new picture of the top.
[13:10.160 --> 13:11.620]  Are you sure this isn't on the Umidigi?
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.940]  That looks like a can of paint. That looks like a top down of a can of red paint.
[13:15.940 --> 13:23.360]  There's a bunch of, um... I don't know. Dust is what I would...
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.940]  Come on! Get rid of this shit!
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.400]  I think one drink isn't going to hurt you. It's just one little sip.
[13:31.740 --> 13:36.500]  I love it when you gag and choke and throw up more than anyone, but I think you'll die.
[13:37.240 --> 13:41.020]  I love that none of you motherfuckers managed to hold onto an apple for more than two weeks,
[13:41.060 --> 13:44.080]  but he can hold a fucking boba tea for six months.
[13:46.460 --> 13:50.140]  You know what? I think I got an apple actually in my fridge right now.
[13:50.380 --> 13:54.160]  I do. I got... The apple might be like six months.
[13:54.280 --> 13:55.300]  Do you want me to pull the apple out?
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.540]  Yeah, that's a f***ing face apple.
[13:57.820 --> 13:58.620]  Yeah, because it's...
[13:58.620 --> 14:00.140]  That's a fucking piece of history right there.
[14:00.140 --> 14:00.760]  I'll just put it back in.
[14:00.780 --> 14:06.220]  Okay, we're going deep in the fridge. The boba... The slush has been blocking the apple,
[14:06.360 --> 14:10.180]  which also needs to be removed, and I just... I've been ignoring it.
[14:10.240 --> 14:12.560]  Let me see. I think the apple's not holding well.
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.400]  So this episode is just you cleaning out your fridge?
[14:20.140 --> 14:22.120]  That sounds like such a great supplemental.
[14:22.840 --> 14:27.080]  Andrew just enlisting off. He's just stood at his fridge with a black trash bag.
[14:27.840 --> 14:32.600]  It looks like... Is Andrew playing Assassin's Creed? What is that? Valhalla?
[14:33.660 --> 14:37.080]  Oh, there's a Ubisoft... I was just seeing what was going on with the Ubisoft sale.
[14:38.280 --> 14:41.860]  Do you have a laptop on top of your desk?
[14:42.660 --> 14:42.800]  Yeah.
[14:43.040 --> 14:45.020]  Above... Is it on a stand? What's under it?
[14:45.940 --> 14:46.240]  A keyboard?
[14:47.040 --> 14:50.380]  We've talked about this. The norm shell is underneath it.
[14:51.200 --> 14:57.100]  Oh, right. What on earth is all the schmutz all over your...
[14:58.680 --> 15:00.040]  How do your keys work?
[15:01.140 --> 15:01.760]  That's a...
[15:01.760 --> 15:02.020]  What do you mean?
[15:02.420 --> 15:03.440]  That's a wrinkled apple.
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.140]  That's a messed up apple. I'm more distracted by just the gumpf.
[15:08.960 --> 15:12.000]  Oh, the bottom keyboard? The bottom gumpf?
[15:12.200 --> 15:13.680]  All of it. There's gumpf everywhere.
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.160]  Unfortunately, the picture quality is too high.
[15:17.380 --> 15:21.400]  I don't understand. I thought this was just dusted.
[15:22.380 --> 15:23.900]  Like a week ago.
[15:24.440 --> 15:25.940]  That's your mom's cleaning job?
[15:26.540 --> 15:28.740]  No, no, no.
[15:28.800 --> 15:30.820]  That's not his mom's cleaning job.
[15:31.180 --> 15:33.360]  Wait, for the keyboard thing? Is that what you mean?
[15:34.340 --> 15:37.200]  Oh, well, listen. I've had food since then, okay?
[15:37.340 --> 15:43.440]  And the problem is, I need to have the food on the laptop, which is above that.
[15:44.380 --> 15:45.920]  There's... it's the remnant's fault.
[15:45.920 --> 15:48.360]  He needs to have food on the laptop.
[15:50.440 --> 15:50.840]  Because...
[15:53.900 --> 15:57.040]  You don't need to put food anywhere near that.
[15:57.520 --> 15:58.220]  No, because...
[15:58.220 --> 16:00.380]  What, do you want him to put it on the toilet next to him in the bathtub?
[16:00.600 --> 16:03.700]  We already eliminated that. We told him he can't do that anymore.
[16:03.940 --> 16:06.660]  We told him he can't make hot dogs in his closet anymore.
[16:06.920 --> 16:08.640]  Where's this poor boy gonna eat?
[16:10.780 --> 16:14.400]  No, we have established that I don't have a table.
[16:14.560 --> 16:17.900]  So I typically will eat at my desk.
[16:18.020 --> 16:24.400]  But the big keyboard for the Mac I have, I can't put a plate on it.
[16:24.960 --> 16:27.360]  And I have no surface area to my left.
[16:27.460 --> 16:32.260]  So I use the top of my laptop as like a flat surface.
[16:33.140 --> 16:34.280]  A, you're an animal.
[16:34.540 --> 16:36.800]  B, what about all the shit that's behind it?
[16:36.800 --> 16:38.700]  Security or whatever that says.
[16:39.140 --> 16:41.840]  Why don't you move some of that and just slide everything back a bit?
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.240]  There's not enough room here. Let me take a photo of the security.
[16:44.280 --> 16:45.640]  I need a wide.
[16:46.040 --> 16:49.900]  I think all that stuff is... that seems like a load-bearing DVD.
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.380]  Those were Denzel Washington movies that you cannot get online.
[16:56.080 --> 16:56.840]  Like John Q?
[16:58.120 --> 17:00.900]  It is for Queen and Country, I think.
[17:01.040 --> 17:01.260]  Okay.
[17:01.260 --> 17:01.780]  Ew.
[17:02.740 --> 17:03.380]  Uh, yeah.
[17:03.560 --> 17:06.060]  And Ricochet are the... are the...
[17:06.820 --> 17:07.300]  Ricochet.
[17:08.420 --> 17:08.900]  Um.
[17:09.540 --> 17:10.660]  I remember that that was a movie.
[17:11.300 --> 17:13.320]  Sean Lithgow's in it. I'm excited to see it.
[17:13.620 --> 17:15.540]  Very highly recommended by TPG.
[17:16.440 --> 17:16.920]  Lithgow.
[17:17.640 --> 17:18.360]  There you go.
[17:19.320 --> 17:21.480]  So this is the side of the desk.
[17:23.460 --> 17:25.520]  This... this feels like old f*** ways to be.
[17:25.760 --> 17:26.480]  I love this.
[17:26.880 --> 17:28.960]  Gavin has f***ing a lot of opinions here.
[17:29.120 --> 17:29.460]  Okay.
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.820]  There's no... where am I putting a plate?
[17:32.280 --> 17:33.640]  There's no plate room there.
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.600]  Oh, is that the... is that the GoXLR?
[17:36.120 --> 17:37.020]  That is the GoXLR.
[17:37.300 --> 17:37.460]  Yeah.
[17:38.060 --> 17:39.420]  Is it running and working and everything?
[17:39.680 --> 17:40.620]  Oh, it's... it's humming.
[17:41.060 --> 17:44.440]  Look how new that thing is. And look how old it looks.
[17:45.980 --> 17:46.640]  It's humming.
[17:47.580 --> 17:49.340]  It's because he's put it to use.
[17:49.820 --> 17:50.800]  It's because he put it to work.
[17:51.140 --> 17:52.340]  Nick, can I ask you a question?
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.580]  Yeah, go for it.
[17:53.600 --> 17:55.240]  Just out of personal curiosity.
[17:55.360 --> 17:55.480]  Sure.
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.100]  Have you noticed an increase in audio quality since he got that?
[17:59.100 --> 18:02.620]  Because Gavin was having so much trouble with his audio blowing out in gameplay videos.
[18:02.720 --> 18:05.300]  I haven't noticed a difference so far.
[18:05.360 --> 18:05.740]  Oh.
[18:06.240 --> 18:06.960]  It's not bad.
[18:08.580 --> 18:08.980]  But...
[18:08.980 --> 18:09.900]  Just the same?
[18:10.260 --> 18:10.900]  Just the same.
[18:11.500 --> 18:13.180]  Maybe I'm not doing something right. Maybe I'll go through with Gavin.
[18:13.180 --> 18:14.520]  Maybe Gavin's just super picky.
[18:15.060 --> 18:16.040]  I'm pretty audio picky.
[18:16.640 --> 18:18.920]  I think you're audio picky, yeah. And that's okay.
[18:18.940 --> 18:21.060]  Well, after you listen to that Gears of War video, it gives me a headache.
[18:22.980 --> 18:23.580]  What video?
[18:24.440 --> 18:25.780]  The Gears of War one I edited.
[18:26.320 --> 18:26.720]  Oh.
[18:26.720 --> 18:31.400]  No, I didn't. But I saw a lot of comments about it.
[18:31.580 --> 18:32.320]  Oh, you did? Good.
[18:32.480 --> 18:33.820]  I believe you're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:33.820 --> 18:35.280]  What were the comments? I didn't see them.
[18:35.880 --> 18:38.280]  It was just mainly about my audio being terrible.
[18:38.720 --> 18:39.220]  Oh, okay.
[18:39.840 --> 18:45.940]  Speaking of comments, not to get away from Andrew's desk, or the creative assortment of items.
[18:47.480 --> 18:51.940]  Just real quick, I gotta say, when we all talked about seeing Twisters the other day,
[18:52.020 --> 18:56.060]  and none of us liked it, I thought... I assumed we were going to catch some heat.
[18:56.060 --> 18:58.800]  Because I had a feeling it was going to be a pretty popular movie.
[18:58.980 --> 19:02.140]  And, you know, What's-His-Face is real popular right now and everything.
[19:03.640 --> 19:08.460]  I was really surprised and heartened by the fact that pretty much the entire
[19:08.460 --> 19:10.900]  audience at a whole agreed with us and backed us up.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.080]  And nobody liked that movie.
[19:12.700 --> 19:12.860]  Why?
[19:13.540 --> 19:14.740]  Take that, Zabra Badour.
[19:15.700 --> 19:16.100]  Anyway...
[19:16.100 --> 19:17.420]  Is that what happened?
[19:17.920 --> 19:21.000]  Yeah, anyway, Andrew, you were talking about your dust.
[19:21.920 --> 19:22.620]  I don't know what happened.
[19:22.820 --> 19:24.080]  Listen, dust exists.
[19:24.500 --> 19:25.800]  No, it's the opposite of what happened.
[19:26.060 --> 19:26.560]  Oh!
[19:27.380 --> 19:28.280]  And a huge minority.
[19:28.820 --> 19:32.400]  I think the people just sensed the jealousy coming from you three.
[19:32.760 --> 19:35.300]  That it is the box office smash.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.020]  Well, I guess not the smash because it's Deadpool Wolverine.
[19:38.240 --> 19:39.860]  He oversold it immediately.
[19:39.980 --> 19:41.300]  The box office smash.
[19:41.560 --> 19:45.180]  Well, actually, in a traditional summer, it would be the smash.
[19:45.440 --> 19:47.420]  But it just got double smashed.
[19:47.860 --> 19:51.000]  It, much like Twisters, a second one came in.
[19:51.140 --> 19:52.380]  That's Deadpool Wolverine.
[19:52.940 --> 19:58.660]  I loved all the armchair analysis of how we're film snobs or we're film hipsters
[19:58.660 --> 20:01.920]  or we grew up in a time when we evaluated films differently.
[20:02.160 --> 20:05.240]  And we can't just understand and appreciate it for what it is.
[20:05.340 --> 20:06.720]  No, it just wasn't a very good movie.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.380]  Well, I was just comparing it to the first one.
[20:09.380 --> 20:11.200]  As a standalone, I might feel differently.
[20:11.300 --> 20:12.540]  But the first one's a great movie.
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.060]  I think everything that the people said was correct.
[20:15.740 --> 20:18.320]  And that they should continue to see Twisters because it's a great movie.
[20:18.700 --> 20:20.600]  I'm tired of the excuse of,
[20:20.600 --> 20:21.880]  oh, yeah, it wasn't very good.
[20:21.940 --> 20:25.480]  It was a summer blockbuster when there are so many out there that are good.
[20:25.820 --> 20:27.880]  And everyone has bad ones, I guess.
[20:28.580 --> 20:30.340]  Deadpool Wolverine, big summer blockbuster.
[20:30.740 --> 20:31.960]  Big summer blockbuster.
[20:32.180 --> 20:36.320]  I haven't seen that movie, but everybody that has fucking speaks very glowingly about it.
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.320]  I just I think I appreciate it more because it's been so long since I've been in a rammed
[20:41.320 --> 20:44.160]  movie theater with everyone laughing so much.
[20:44.260 --> 20:46.400]  It was just like, oh, I remember this.
[20:47.220 --> 20:47.760]  You watched it?
[20:47.840 --> 20:48.600]  Was it you liked it?
[20:49.180 --> 20:49.680]  Deadpool Wolverine?
[20:49.740 --> 20:49.860]  I liked it.
[20:49.860 --> 20:54.520]  Yeah, I mean, it's not the deepest story, but it was very entertaining, I thought.
[20:55.200 --> 20:56.220]  You should see it again.
[20:56.780 --> 20:58.020]  See if that opinion changes.
[20:58.500 --> 21:00.960]  I was thinking about seeing it with Millie before she goes off to college if she wants to.
[21:01.480 --> 21:01.920]  Oh, you should.
[21:02.600 --> 21:02.820]  Yeah.
[21:03.200 --> 21:03.600]  Try to get around.
[21:03.620 --> 21:04.040]  I agree.
[21:05.360 --> 21:11.860]  I saw a comment that I thought was so funny of imagine if I beat Gavin in the movie league
[21:11.860 --> 21:15.940]  by like three million and the difference is the Kevin Costner, Western.
[21:19.140 --> 21:23.060]  If Horizon part two, if that's the difference, it would be amazing.
[21:23.400 --> 21:27.480]  I'm somehow hoping that it's so tight that my 15 remaining bucks is what takes me through
[21:27.480 --> 21:28.100]  the finish line.
[21:28.340 --> 21:30.640]  It is going to come down to Alien.
[21:31.340 --> 21:36.340]  If Alien does worse, I projected in my head of being less popular than Covenant,
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.200]  but that might not be the case.
[21:38.700 --> 21:41.480]  And if it's not, that's a that's a problem for me.
[21:41.980 --> 21:42.280]  Hell yeah.
[21:42.820 --> 21:46.820]  Well, I'm just amazed at how well those two movies did.
[21:47.500 --> 21:49.940]  Deadpool, like breaking box office records.
[21:50.060 --> 21:52.000]  And then what was the the Inside Out two?
[21:52.320 --> 21:53.120]  Holy shit.
[21:53.180 --> 21:53.980]  That's wild.
[21:54.500 --> 21:56.440]  That is such a fun thing.
[21:56.520 --> 21:57.280]  Oh, and Bad Boys, too.
[21:57.340 --> 21:59.360]  Yeah, it's been such a fun thing to watch.
[21:59.420 --> 22:03.000]  And I really hope we do it every year because it just makes me appreciate
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.520]  summer film releases in a way that I used to ignore them.
[22:06.680 --> 22:07.620]  You know, I agree.
[22:07.700 --> 22:09.080]  I've been way more invested.
[22:09.700 --> 22:13.760]  I also it made me realize how disconnected I was from the summer releases
[22:14.360 --> 22:17.280]  where I was like inside out to like, who wants that?
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.100]  Nobody wants that.
[22:18.220 --> 22:20.300]  And it's like by far the big everybody.
[22:20.460 --> 22:21.980]  Apparently everybody wanted it.
[22:22.460 --> 22:27.540]  What if next time we do this, we take our winnings as currency for the next pick?
[22:29.300 --> 22:33.140]  So that somehow I'm a major advantage and I have more points to spend
[22:33.140 --> 22:34.580]  because I did better last year.
[22:34.920 --> 22:35.860]  Yeah, that sucks.
[22:35.860 --> 22:40.860]  Yeah, you are describing the opposite of how every game work like every sport.
[22:41.060 --> 22:41.400]  Yeah.
[22:41.840 --> 22:44.540]  You're like, what if the team that wins the championship
[22:44.540 --> 22:47.300]  gets the first pick in the draft next year?
[22:47.540 --> 22:48.880]  I mean, that works in sports.
[22:48.900 --> 22:52.040]  But when it comes to money, I feel like you it's the opposite.
[22:52.660 --> 22:55.040]  I think I like your idea a lot.
[22:56.080 --> 22:56.920]  What do you mean how?
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.420]  What do you what do you mean?
[22:59.480 --> 23:00.220]  What do I mean?
[23:00.280 --> 23:03.460]  How like if I if my studio made the most profit,
[23:03.900 --> 23:05.680]  surely I'm going to be buying up more movies.
[23:06.300 --> 23:06.700]  Yeah.
[23:07.560 --> 23:09.440]  And so where does the fun game begin?
[23:09.640 --> 23:10.560]  Yeah. So what is that?
[23:10.800 --> 23:10.980]  What?
[23:11.160 --> 23:11.800]  So what?
[23:11.940 --> 23:12.340]  What?
[23:12.440 --> 23:17.620]  It seems to me like just every every summer we tune in to watch Gavin make more money.
[23:17.720 --> 23:19.200]  I take a bigger piece of pie.
[23:19.300 --> 23:22.220]  What are you talking about?
[23:22.220 --> 23:24.340]  Yeah, I was going to say Gavin doesn't want to play Monopoly.
[23:24.500 --> 23:25.740]  He wants to be Monopoly.
[23:26.020 --> 23:28.000]  He doesn't want to play Monopoly.
[23:28.060 --> 23:29.980]  He wants to live in the real world, apparently.
[23:30.180 --> 23:31.960]  I don't want to start with 98 points.
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.540]  I want like 120 points.
[23:33.540 --> 23:36.800]  Yeah, I want Nick to start with like 16.
[23:37.020 --> 23:42.300]  I think life is the problem because I like your idea a lot.
[23:42.300 --> 23:46.440]  If like it didn't take one year essentially to do one of these
[23:46.440 --> 23:51.560]  because the premise of you absolutely fussing about with your movies and
[23:51.560 --> 23:54.640]  fucking up and going bankrupt is really funny to me.
[23:55.200 --> 23:55.760]  Absolutely.
[23:56.760 --> 23:59.340]  Yeah, we should figure this out in a shorter format.
[23:59.480 --> 24:00.480]  That's such a good idea.
[24:00.480 --> 24:05.020]  But that is like, yeah, because of like this format for this,
[24:05.080 --> 24:06.840]  that is eight years of life.
[24:06.940 --> 24:08.740]  And it's just too much for that joke.
[24:08.980 --> 24:10.340]  I like high stakes gaming.
[24:11.640 --> 24:12.740]  Listen, I'm with you.
[24:12.900 --> 24:13.780]  I'm all the way.
[24:14.240 --> 24:16.860]  And that's why people should see Deadpool and Wolverine and Twisters
[24:16.860 --> 24:20.080]  and Fly Me to the Moon if it's still in your area.
[24:20.520 --> 24:22.920]  People should see whatever movie they want to see.
[24:23.040 --> 24:26.920]  And they should feel free to enjoy whatever movie they want to enjoy,
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.820]  whether the regulation crew likes it or not.
[24:29.820 --> 24:32.100]  And we don't, just so you know.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.680]  I need to pivot to movies talking about Twisters,
[24:36.860 --> 24:39.340]  one of America's great blockbusters of the year.
[24:39.940 --> 24:46.020]  Last episode, I brought up the Pulse Shear thing, and it was not felt.
[24:46.480 --> 24:48.340]  You guys didn't know this at the time.
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.020]  I have never been more embarrassed in the history of fuckface
[24:53.020 --> 24:54.780]  than after I made that statement.
[24:55.060 --> 24:56.400]  How about in the history of regulation?
[24:56.980 --> 24:57.820]  Or regulation?
[24:58.000 --> 24:58.780]  Yeah, that's true.
[24:58.780 --> 25:00.200]  There's fewer episodes of that.
[25:00.740 --> 25:02.580]  About him being a fetus in the first one?
[25:02.580 --> 25:04.100]  Yeah, about him being a fetus in the first.
[25:04.220 --> 25:07.020]  I have never been more embarrassed in the history of this show.
[25:07.300 --> 25:11.020]  That was more embarrassing than the Swiss army knife being made in Germany?
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.040]  Way more embarrassing.
[25:12.500 --> 25:13.660]  Because I got got.
[25:14.120 --> 25:16.980]  That was me just not, that was me getting myself.
[25:17.600 --> 25:18.320]  I got got.
[25:18.740 --> 25:22.260]  And I knew what happened, and I couldn't vocalize it at the time.
[25:22.640 --> 25:25.640]  But it was, it was like in a con movie,
[25:25.640 --> 25:28.640]  when the guy steals all your money and escapes.
[25:28.820 --> 25:30.620]  And then they go, oh no.
[25:30.840 --> 25:32.420]  Like, they realize what happened.
[25:32.620 --> 25:34.280]  That was me internally.
[25:34.660 --> 25:38.040]  Every time you guys made a joke about that, it killed me at that time.
[25:38.260 --> 25:39.820]  It's the most embarrassed I've been.
[25:40.140 --> 25:42.600]  Because I realized, oh, he got me.
[25:42.920 --> 25:43.900]  He got me so good.
[25:44.260 --> 25:46.140]  He, it was absolutely...
[25:46.140 --> 25:49.860]  Because it was, the TikTok I saw of it was him at a red carpet.
[25:50.180 --> 25:51.920]  So it didn't feel like his content.
[25:52.460 --> 25:56.620]  And it, it included a clip of a pregnant woman in the background of it.
[25:56.760 --> 25:58.100]  It all felt so real.
[25:58.140 --> 26:02.780]  But upon like any analysis of like actual, it was one of those things I just swiped through.
[26:02.980 --> 26:05.620]  And I went, ah, Twister's probably came out in like the 80s.
[26:05.660 --> 26:06.820]  That feels right to me, or Twister.
[26:07.920 --> 26:10.220]  And then when you guys brought up that it was a 90s movie.
[26:10.460 --> 26:12.060]  I was like, oh, that son of a bitch.
[26:12.160 --> 26:15.180]  Like, I am, he designed that as the joke.
[26:15.260 --> 26:18.320]  And I stepped in that just massively.
[26:18.940 --> 26:20.120]  You, you Brimley'd it.
[26:20.880 --> 26:22.640]  I Brimley'd it so bad.
[26:23.500 --> 26:24.980]  And it made it so much worse.
[26:25.380 --> 26:27.020]  Knowing that that was, it was a trap.
[26:27.140 --> 26:30.200]  It was someone, he put down a Brimley trap and I stepped right in.
[26:30.640 --> 26:34.960]  What a, what a very specific niche verb.
[26:35.740 --> 26:36.800]  Even for us.
[26:37.180 --> 26:37.960]  We keep getting it though.
[26:38.120 --> 26:38.380]  Brimley'd?
[26:38.780 --> 26:39.100]  Yeah.
[26:39.400 --> 26:39.660]  Yeah.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.600]  I share your pain, dude.
[26:41.700 --> 26:42.140]  I've been there.
[26:42.580 --> 26:43.280]  Oh yeah, I know.
[26:43.360 --> 26:45.520]  I thought of, I was like, oh, fuck Geoff.
[26:45.940 --> 26:47.840]  Geoff knows what this is like, but oh my god.
[26:48.120 --> 26:49.940]  I mean, I had to make that phone call after the episode.
[26:50.500 --> 26:50.720]  Oh.
[26:51.420 --> 26:51.900]  How dumb I am.
[26:52.300 --> 26:52.800]  It sucks.
[26:53.940 --> 26:55.300]  It's not even just being dumb.
[26:55.480 --> 26:56.340]  It's someone getting you.
[26:56.680 --> 26:57.280]  He got me.
[26:57.480 --> 26:58.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[26:58.220 --> 27:00.660]  And it was one of those things where I assumed it was a viral TikTok.
[27:00.900 --> 27:06.900]  It came up in my feed again later that day and it had like 7,000 likes.
[27:07.280 --> 27:09.080]  Like, it was very small.
[27:09.720 --> 27:12.400]  It was a small, it didn't, it wasn't wide.
[27:12.660 --> 27:16.040]  I actually paid attention to it this time and I was like, oh, this is just his account.
[27:17.940 --> 27:19.280]  Oh, oh, it hurt.
[27:20.440 --> 27:21.080]  It hurt.
[27:21.300 --> 27:22.760]  That is really funny.
[27:22.860 --> 27:25.600]  But what doesn't hurt is going to see Twisters, the American blockbuster.
[27:28.520 --> 27:30.700]  Go see Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.
[27:31.340 --> 27:32.320]  It doesn't matter.
[27:32.640 --> 27:35.360]  It's not going to make a bit of fucking difference, but see it anyway.
[27:35.840 --> 27:38.200]  The only movie I don't want people to see is Aliens Covenant.
[27:38.580 --> 27:40.660]  Or Romulus, whatever the fuck it's called.
[27:41.200 --> 27:41.760]  Teen Aliens.
[27:42.100 --> 27:43.520]  Teen Aliens, yeah, don't see that.
[27:44.120 --> 27:44.960]  I hear that's no good.
[27:45.280 --> 27:45.940]  I think it looks decent.
[27:46.500 --> 27:53.180]  I hear, oh, Gavin, I hear that Horizon, uh, whatever the fuck it's called, uh,
[27:53.300 --> 27:58.540]  Dawn Part 2 is going to show at Cannes Film Festival, which is not in the US,
[27:58.600 --> 28:00.260]  but maybe that'll drum up some excitement.
[28:00.660 --> 28:01.140]  And then we go.
[28:02.620 --> 28:05.460]  No, I think you should go.
[28:06.600 --> 28:07.440]  I've been before.
[28:07.920 --> 28:08.640]  I'll probably stay back.
[28:09.020 --> 28:09.760]  Have you been to Cannes?
[28:10.380 --> 28:10.740]  Yeah.
[28:11.500 --> 28:12.180]  Well, for what?
[28:12.900 --> 28:15.360]  Some sort of broadcast, you know, YouTube thing.
[28:16.060 --> 28:18.500]  Oh, they did a YouTube thing at Cannes?
[28:18.940 --> 28:19.280]  Yeah.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.040]  I don't, that sounds, I don't.
[28:23.520 --> 28:24.500]  Does that surprise you?
[28:24.880 --> 28:26.180]  Jamie Oliver was there for some reason.
[28:26.680 --> 28:30.000]  Are you saying it both ways so you don't get got right now, Andrew?
[28:30.300 --> 28:33.080]  I'm trying to evaluate, is what I'm trying to do.
[28:33.540 --> 28:36.360]  Because he said that in a way that was like, I just made that up.
[28:36.380 --> 28:38.180]  But he also just sounds like that sometimes.
[28:39.020 --> 28:40.340]  No, he's definitely been to Cannes.
[28:40.440 --> 28:41.220]  I remember when he went.
[28:41.680 --> 28:42.780]  He's not lying about that.
[28:43.280 --> 28:43.680]  Okay.
[28:44.140 --> 28:46.360]  It'd be a weird got, but you know what?
[28:46.460 --> 28:48.640]  I'm, I'm in my paranoid era right now.
[28:48.800 --> 28:49.400]  This is where I'm at.
[28:50.120 --> 28:50.960]  You owe me 15 bucks.
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.120]  I just covered for you.
[28:52.360 --> 28:52.840]  Thanks, man.
[28:53.080 --> 28:53.400]  I'm in a paranoid era.
[28:53.460 --> 28:53.920]  Yeah, no problem.
[28:54.580 --> 28:55.800]  Jamie Oliver was there.
[28:56.020 --> 28:56.620]  Is that what you said?
[28:57.220 --> 28:57.500]  Yeah.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.200]  Do him!
[28:58.700 --> 28:59.980]  No, he, this, no.
[29:00.300 --> 29:02.120]  Why would he, he's not a YouTube guy.
[29:03.620 --> 29:05.360]  Is Jamie Oliver a YouTube guy?
[29:06.100 --> 29:07.160]  Yeah, he had a YouTube channel.
[29:07.920 --> 29:09.780]  A lot of people have YouTube channels.
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.160]  I have a YouTube channel.
[29:12.160 --> 29:14.080]  That doesn't mean anything.
[29:14.340 --> 29:16.440]  Are you referring to the John Caviar channel?
[29:17.740 --> 29:20.140]  Uh, I should have a John Caviar channel.
[29:20.360 --> 29:20.780]  No, I'm not.
[29:21.240 --> 29:23.080]  I don't have the range of that many.
[29:23.080 --> 29:25.000]  I was referring to the musician John Caviar.
[29:25.980 --> 29:26.400]  No.
[29:26.540 --> 29:29.720]  Who, uh, hopefully we sent some, some, some traffic his way.
[29:30.580 --> 29:32.400]  That just proves that you met Jamie Oliver.
[29:33.040 --> 29:35.780]  Also, Jamie Oliver looks like he wants to kill both of you.
[29:37.260 --> 29:38.120]  He's really nice.
[29:39.580 --> 29:40.860]  I was in a headlock.
[29:40.860 --> 29:42.880]  You guys look like you're about to make out.
[29:44.960 --> 29:46.200]  Look how jealous Dan is.
[29:46.900 --> 29:50.540]  Do, um, do balls ever come through the glory hole or is it usually just the shaft?
[29:51.340 --> 29:53.240]  I think it's just shaft, right?
[29:53.420 --> 29:56.200]  Hey, so are you on like a weirdo run or what's happening?
[29:56.560 --> 29:59.900]  Because last time it was the happy ending and this time it's this.
[30:00.000 --> 30:01.700]  I'm just trying to get clarity on a lot of these things.
[30:01.960 --> 30:03.800]  I think it's just the shaft.
[30:05.200 --> 30:05.600]  Right?
[30:07.160 --> 30:08.820]  I would think so, but I just don't know.
[30:08.820 --> 30:12.680]  I'm wondering whether there's ever like a larger hole below the glory hole
[30:12.680 --> 30:17.000]  where you can get a hand in and sort of nurse the balls a little bit.
[30:20.380 --> 30:23.560]  If I was designing a glory hole, I think that's what I would do.
[30:24.420 --> 30:28.640]  You would make a second hole for the balls, but then you'd have to like push the ball.
[30:29.180 --> 30:31.620]  No, I wouldn't be thumbing the balls through the hole.
[30:31.760 --> 30:33.260]  I'd be, it'd be a hand hole.
[30:34.340 --> 30:39.460]  Oh, so you'd have like dick goes out, hand goes in.
[30:40.720 --> 30:43.940]  That makes way more sense. I like that.
[30:44.120 --> 30:46.920]  Yeah, I like that.
[30:47.540 --> 30:48.640]  You should do that.
[30:48.880 --> 30:52.560]  Yeah, because otherwise imagining the glory hole situation,
[30:52.560 --> 30:54.460]  I just don't, I don't know if it'd be that enjoyable.
[30:54.780 --> 30:58.660]  Man, could you imagine having a hold of some dude's wiener in one hand
[30:58.660 --> 31:01.340]  and his balls in the other and there's a wall between you?
[31:01.340 --> 31:04.100]  He's really at your disposal at that, at that point.
[31:05.580 --> 31:06.820]  There's not much he can do.
[31:06.900 --> 31:08.780]  There's not much you can do to get out of that situation.
[31:08.980 --> 31:11.700]  You're kind of at the mercy of the other side of the glory hole there.
[31:12.120 --> 31:13.680]  I think if I was using a glory hole,
[31:13.880 --> 31:17.040]  I would feel more vulnerable if my balls were also through.
[31:17.540 --> 31:21.380]  Yeah, because if you pull back too far, you might just like pop them right off.
[31:23.000 --> 31:23.820]  They gotta suck through the hole.
[31:23.820 --> 31:26.840]  Let me make sure that I'm understanding your visual correctly.
[31:26.840 --> 31:30.940]  Are you saying you want the equivalent of like one of these,
[31:31.480 --> 31:35.040]  but like hand holes for the other side?
[31:35.820 --> 31:37.100]  Has anyone made one of those?
[31:39.740 --> 31:42.000]  You know where like they shove their head in?
[31:43.840 --> 31:46.620]  Like you want the head holes, but for hands.
[31:51.240 --> 31:52.940]  Brad Pitt, that is your dick.
[31:56.680 --> 31:58.360]  That's your dick and balls.
[31:58.360 --> 32:01.300]  Oh, we've got to make one.
[32:02.100 --> 32:09.230]  Oh, that's terrific.
[32:15.710 --> 32:17.910]  Is that what you meant for the hand holes?
[32:17.990 --> 32:20.490]  Like you wanted those holes on the side of the mini hole?
[32:21.410 --> 32:22.690]  Why would it be on the side?
[32:23.290 --> 32:25.770]  I thought you wanted them to be able to reach through.
[32:27.110 --> 32:29.490]  Shall I put a diagram? I can start drawing.
[32:29.490 --> 32:30.830]  Please draw.
[32:31.170 --> 32:36.430]  Because I originally imagined just a bigger hole that the balls would go through.
[32:36.810 --> 32:38.770]  But then you said you wanted hands.
[32:39.390 --> 32:45.870]  So I thought maybe there'd be two arm holes so the person could reach through on the...
[32:46.310 --> 32:48.650]  I don't know how to... I guess the suck inside.
[32:48.670 --> 32:50.970]  I don't know how to say... how do I differentiate?
[32:52.370 --> 32:53.770]  I think the suck inside.
[32:55.530 --> 32:56.530]  The what?
[32:56.530 --> 33:01.110]  The suck inside. Because one side sucks, the other stands.
[33:02.190 --> 33:04.910]  What's a more elegant way to describe the suck inside?
[33:05.590 --> 33:07.470]  You got a suck side and a tickle side.
[33:09.790 --> 33:10.810]  The giver?
[33:16.170 --> 33:20.270]  I'm excited to see the diagram.
[33:20.490 --> 33:23.910]  I'm also really excited to see which regulation listener can't wait.
[33:23.990 --> 33:26.430]  They're falling all over themselves right now to get on the subreddit.
[33:26.890 --> 33:31.910]  They're crazy story about how they put up their balls through a glory hole.
[33:32.790 --> 33:35.270]  This is fucking insane.
[33:35.730 --> 33:36.610]  I'm so excited.
[33:36.910 --> 33:38.510]  Do we know a stunt dick?
[33:40.050 --> 33:43.230]  The joke only works, Geoff, that you're still recovering over.
[33:43.510 --> 33:45.450]  If there is a dick through the hole...
[33:45.450 --> 33:49.390]  I don't think anybody here wants to put their dick through the Tom Cruise hole.
[33:51.070 --> 33:52.650]  I think we need a stunt dick.
[33:52.650 --> 33:57.910]  I would absolutely put my dick through a Tom Cruise hole so Emily can take a photo of it.
[33:58.010 --> 33:59.330]  Come on.
[33:59.630 --> 34:00.750]  How would you not?
[34:01.690 --> 34:05.610]  Ah, shit. I've messed up again. I forgot that the canvas is so much bigger than the...
[34:06.530 --> 34:07.110]  All right.
[34:07.170 --> 34:08.250]  Oh my god.
[34:09.810 --> 34:10.970]  It's so small.
[34:11.530 --> 34:13.190]  It's very small. I've messed it up again.
[34:16.090 --> 34:17.330]  That's what I imagined.
[34:18.330 --> 34:21.590]  So it's just a really big hole. It's just a large glory hole.
[34:21.590 --> 34:24.070]  It looks like you're sticking your hand in a light socket.
[34:26.450 --> 34:28.650]  I think you want the hole to be small.
[34:29.670 --> 34:34.970]  I think you want the least amount of you possible is the point, isn't it?
[34:35.570 --> 34:36.650]  What do you mean the least? The what?
[34:37.170 --> 34:41.010]  Isn't the whole point of the glory hole the privacy? The unknown?
[34:41.810 --> 34:45.390]  Like, that's a huge hole. I feel like that's revealing too much of the person.
[34:45.510 --> 34:49.710]  Well, it needs to be large enough for a hand. Maybe it's too big in that diagram,
[34:49.710 --> 34:51.450]  but I just want you to be able to see the hand.
[34:51.870 --> 34:53.770]  Yeah, so you're just giving us the broad strokes.
[34:55.190 --> 34:58.190]  Yeah, that's the uniform glory hole, I think.
[34:58.610 --> 35:01.270]  But that's what I'm saying. Maybe you have two other holes.
[35:02.270 --> 35:02.890]  Two holes.
[35:02.890 --> 35:03.130]  For the hands.
[35:03.990 --> 35:07.070]  So you've got the dick hole and then you got the two hands on the side.
[35:07.890 --> 35:08.890]  Why do you need both hands?
[35:09.770 --> 35:11.730]  Well, you just want one hand? That doesn't feel right.
[35:11.730 --> 35:15.470]  If you're doing a good job on the wiener, you got your... it looks like you got your right
[35:15.470 --> 35:18.330]  hand on the shaft and then your left hand down in the hand hole.
[35:18.330 --> 35:20.430]  So your hands are both probably used.
[35:21.230 --> 35:22.410]  I think you want two.
[35:23.130 --> 35:24.370]  Can you draw it out for me?
[35:24.410 --> 35:27.670]  Two hands on the balls? Are you like milking them? Like, is this fucking out of order?
[35:27.890 --> 35:30.610]  So, two holes. Two holes in the wall.
[35:30.830 --> 35:32.830]  Oh, yeah. One for righty, one for lefty.
[35:33.530 --> 35:37.570]  Well, just I think it would feel weird to only be able to have one hand go through the wall.
[35:40.270 --> 35:40.670]  I...
[35:42.810 --> 35:43.210]  disagree.
[35:44.070 --> 35:45.470]  You think only one hand?
[35:46.150 --> 35:50.130]  Yeah, you probably want to use the other hand to, like, balance yourself.
[35:50.910 --> 35:51.170]  Maybe.
[35:51.650 --> 35:55.050]  You're getting a dick slammed in your mouth when you got a hand through a hole in the darkness.
[35:55.270 --> 35:58.570]  You just grab it onto who God knows what. Probably a little disorienting.
[36:01.700 --> 36:05.500]  That's a fair point. I guess I was just... I wasn't really thinking in the context of...
[36:06.280 --> 36:09.320]  To be... to be fair, it was... it was bold of me to try and revamp something
[36:09.320 --> 36:12.320]  I have no experience with. So it's probably not a good idea.
[36:12.760 --> 36:13.980]  I like your idea.
[36:13.980 --> 36:19.990]  But the more I think about glory holes in general, it just seems like a lot of...
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.820]  It doesn't seem like a comfortable experience on either side of the hole.
[36:25.300 --> 36:25.880]  Yeah.
[36:26.020 --> 36:26.960]  I don't think I would be into it.
[36:27.420 --> 36:29.420]  What's the name of those...
[36:31.720 --> 36:35.720]  Anyone here see the movie Life? The alien movie Life?
[36:37.000 --> 36:37.840]  Ryan Reynolds?
[36:39.060 --> 36:39.440]  No.
[36:39.560 --> 36:40.240]  Jake Gyllenhaal?
[36:40.880 --> 36:41.240]  No.
[36:41.240 --> 36:43.960]  One of those boxes that you have that...
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.740]  They put the alien in a box and it's got hand holes in it.
[36:49.400 --> 36:52.400]  That's sort of what I'm envisioning, but I don't know what to call those boxes.
[36:53.400 --> 36:54.900]  What's the point of the holes in that for the alien?
[36:56.020 --> 37:00.820]  The point is to keep the alien contained and the hand holes are so the scientists can like
[37:00.820 --> 37:02.220]  interact with it.
[37:02.280 --> 37:04.040]  Do they put their dicks in the hand holes?
[37:05.340 --> 37:08.520]  I... no, no dicks go through contained...
[37:10.260 --> 37:11.600]  I don't, I don't even know.
[37:13.580 --> 37:14.880]  Contained element? No.
[37:15.940 --> 37:16.300]  Anyway.
[37:16.440 --> 37:17.760]  Are you just talking about this?
[37:17.820 --> 37:19.220]  Yeah! Yes!
[37:19.880 --> 37:21.120]  What are those called?
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.520]  A glove box?
[37:23.100 --> 37:24.420]  A lab box. Yeah.
[37:24.640 --> 37:25.040]  I didn't know.
[37:25.280 --> 37:26.120]  Okay, glove box.
[37:30.460 --> 37:31.680]  That's a glove box?
[37:31.760 --> 37:33.580]  I don't know why you're going... I don't...
[37:33.580 --> 37:35.560]  You heard it wrong. You said it wrong.
[37:35.680 --> 37:37.280]  And now you're going to argue with me that...
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.500]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:38.500 --> 37:39.240]  I'm not arguing.
[37:39.520 --> 37:41.680]  I said like from a lab at the same time.
[37:42.480 --> 37:44.240]  I just, I got the wires crossed.
[37:44.560 --> 37:46.400]  And when I hear glove box, I think of a car.
[37:46.880 --> 37:47.720]  I don't think of that.
[37:47.980 --> 37:49.340]  To be fair, so would I.
[37:50.300 --> 37:54.360]  We used to use those to sandblast stuff when I worked at the tool shop.
[37:54.500 --> 37:54.760]  Right.
[37:55.180 --> 37:56.860]  Yeah, it's just a box that has gloves.
[37:58.580 --> 37:59.460]  It's a glove box.
[37:59.480 --> 38:01.660]  That's what I was picturing with what you were saying, Gavin,
[38:01.760 --> 38:04.000]  of the arm holes through the sides.
[38:04.980 --> 38:05.980]  If you have a glove on?
[38:06.700 --> 38:08.060]  I mean, you probably want a glove...
[38:08.060 --> 38:09.360]  Well, maybe you don't know.
[38:10.060 --> 38:11.260]  No, that glove is interesting.
[38:13.220 --> 38:16.340]  There are a lot of questions that I don't want to...
[38:16.340 --> 38:23.260]  I think that me going down and through this hole any further would be a mistake.
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.280]  There are a lot more places we could go based on what you said.
[38:27.540 --> 38:28.780]  But I think we just move on.
[38:29.300 --> 38:30.160]  Yeah, I think we call it a day.
[38:30.240 --> 38:31.640]  Do you want to hear about some of my house hack?
[38:32.440 --> 38:34.120]  I want to hear about your house hack.
[38:34.200 --> 38:35.520]  Yeah, tell me about your house hack.
[38:36.280 --> 38:38.600]  Oh boy, I guess I'll start with the smallest thing.
[38:39.540 --> 38:42.600]  Uh, took a dump the other day.
[38:43.260 --> 38:43.900]  I love that game.
[38:44.440 --> 38:46.500]  And I've been having a problem with, in my bog,
[38:46.700 --> 38:51.240]  I've been having a problem with mosquitoes, um, flying around while I'm taking dumps.
[38:51.560 --> 38:54.020]  Biting me, biting my exposed skin and all that.
[38:54.520 --> 38:54.840]  What?
[38:56.700 --> 38:58.760]  It's been a very bad mosquito year.
[38:59.140 --> 38:59.460]  Okay.
[38:59.700 --> 39:00.020]  In Texas.
[39:00.400 --> 39:01.040]  Fair enough.
[39:01.480 --> 39:01.720]  Okay.
[39:01.720 --> 39:04.840]  So I started, uh, I was halfway through my two.
[39:05.120 --> 39:08.660]  And, uh, I, before I've sat down, I killed a mosquito with a bug zapper.
[39:09.240 --> 39:11.440]  Because I don't like slamming them because I get blood all over me.
[39:11.580 --> 39:15.400]  So I have a little zapper in there for murking them.
[39:19.760 --> 39:23.480]  The guy, the guy that wants to innovate on the glory hole,
[39:23.660 --> 39:25.900]  doesn't like a little bit of bug on him.
[39:26.260 --> 39:28.780]  I was thinking about a glory hole.
[39:28.980 --> 39:30.100]  I was thinking about...
[39:30.640 --> 39:32.900]  The glory hole guy doesn't want a little...
[39:33.520 --> 39:35.360]  I've never seen a glory hole.
[39:35.420 --> 39:36.340]  I don't know anything about them.
[39:36.360 --> 39:37.740]  You're making glory holes.
[39:37.900 --> 39:39.140]  You're the glory hole guy.
[39:39.160 --> 39:40.040]  So I can innovate.
[39:40.240 --> 39:40.680]  I disobeyed.
[39:40.880 --> 39:42.360]  I've used a glory hole.
[39:42.780 --> 39:44.180]  You know what would be a cool nickname?
[39:44.740 --> 39:45.760]  Glory hole Gavin.
[39:46.340 --> 39:46.820]  Wow.
[39:47.180 --> 39:48.580]  It just kind of works, right?
[39:48.660 --> 39:49.280]  It flows.
[39:50.600 --> 39:51.400]  It's pretty long.
[39:51.780 --> 39:52.180]  GHG.
[39:52.320 --> 39:52.980]  Glory hole Gavin.
[39:53.220 --> 39:53.820]  Glory hole Gavin.
[39:54.360 --> 39:54.840]  GHG.
[39:55.840 --> 39:56.660]  G-hole.
[39:57.660 --> 39:58.520]  Ooh, G-hole.
[39:58.720 --> 39:59.560]  We call you G-hole.
[40:01.000 --> 40:02.000]  Sorry, continue.
[40:02.300 --> 40:03.780]  It's just that I had to...
[40:03.780 --> 40:04.340]  Yeah, go ahead.
[40:04.940 --> 40:05.860]  So I zapped a Mozzie.
[40:06.060 --> 40:06.500]  Dead.
[40:06.660 --> 40:07.200]  Dead as dicks.
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.360]  And then I lent the bug zapper up against the wall.
[40:10.020 --> 40:11.800]  And I'm about halfway through my dump.
[40:13.120 --> 40:15.660]  And suddenly, an explosion.
[40:16.140 --> 40:17.940]  An absolute bang.
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.600]  And the freaking bug zapper exploded out of the battery holder.
[40:24.020 --> 40:24.260]  Oh.
[40:26.800 --> 40:27.760]  It freaking...
[40:27.760 --> 40:28.460]  I've gotta...
[40:28.460 --> 40:30.600]  This is what my wall looks like now.
[40:32.120 --> 40:34.960]  It filled the room with smoke.
[40:35.700 --> 40:39.320]  And it spewed a bunch of black shit into the wall.
[40:39.940 --> 40:41.400]  I have that exact same one.
[40:41.860 --> 40:42.600]  I gotta throw it away.
[40:42.880 --> 40:43.420]  It's hazardous.
[40:43.480 --> 40:43.760]  I used to.
[40:44.320 --> 40:44.620]  Yeah.
[40:45.580 --> 40:47.000]  And that's a picture of the battery.
[40:47.500 --> 40:49.300]  Dura my ass.
[40:49.900 --> 40:54.400]  And suddenly, I'm in a room filled with busted battery fumes.
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.320]  So immediately, before the smoke got to me, I took a real deep breath.
[41:00.460 --> 41:03.360]  And I tried to finish up before I had to breathe again.
[41:03.500 --> 41:04.700]  I was panic wiping.
[41:05.280 --> 41:08.240]  I was absolutely annihilating my cornhole.
[41:08.300 --> 41:11.220]  Trying to get it cleaned so I could get out of there before I had to breathe again.
[41:12.080 --> 41:12.780]  Absolute nightmare.
[41:13.220 --> 41:14.640]  Probably one of the worst dumps in my life.
[41:15.220 --> 41:16.080]  So I've thrown that away.
[41:16.580 --> 41:18.960]  That was Haunted House Problem 1.
[41:20.340 --> 41:21.520]  I don't know what to go with next.
[41:22.380 --> 41:24.300]  Oh, before we move on from that.
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.460]  Can I just say that if you were ever going to be surprised to the point of shitting yourself,
[41:28.620 --> 41:29.960]  you were in the ideal environment.
[41:33.560 --> 41:34.900]  It's a real...
[41:34.900 --> 41:40.260]  To say I shit myself while already sitting on the toilet is a very low stakes statement.
[41:40.600 --> 41:41.780]  I was in the right place.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.060]  Second, a raccoon is taking baths in the pool every night.
[41:48.260 --> 41:49.020]  Don't know what to do about that.
[41:49.020 --> 41:52.700]  Yeah, I was wondering if you were going to talk about that video.
[41:53.600 --> 41:59.920]  Yeah, that's just coming in, walking around in the pool, leaving.
[42:02.380 --> 42:04.260]  That's that's problem number one with the pool.
[42:05.180 --> 42:07.220]  What's wrong with the raccoon going in the pool?
[42:07.360 --> 42:08.540]  Why are we against this?
[42:08.660 --> 42:09.620]  Rabies? I don't know.
[42:09.920 --> 42:11.020]  Yeah, you're lucky.
[42:11.620 --> 42:14.720]  Once again, the glory hole guy can't be telling me about...
[42:14.720 --> 42:17.420]  And he's like in there, like cleaning his balls and stuff.
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.140]  Everybody's balls is getting clean in there.
[42:21.480 --> 42:22.300]  What do you mean?
[42:23.860 --> 42:25.160]  Ball city in there.
[42:25.820 --> 42:29.400]  I don't know, it just feels a bit more dirty than a raccoon fur is.
[42:29.540 --> 42:30.560]  I don't know, bigot.
[42:31.400 --> 42:33.240]  Anyway, that's the easiest problem with the pool.
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.100]  The second problem with the pool is that it's leaking.
[42:35.320 --> 42:35.880]  It's a piece of shit.
[42:36.480 --> 42:41.680]  It's draining out of the side while I'm waiting for the pool to be repaired.
[42:41.920 --> 42:43.120]  While I'm waiting for it to be repaired.
[42:43.940 --> 42:47.400]  I have to keep topping it up because the pool evaporates anyway.
[42:48.360 --> 42:52.520]  So you have to put like an hour of water in every two weeks or something.
[42:53.080 --> 42:55.560]  But the fact that it's leaking means it's doing it slightly faster.
[42:56.400 --> 42:59.540]  So I put the hose in the pool, set a timer for an hour.
[42:59.940 --> 43:02.220]  I came back to see if it topped up nicely.
[43:02.800 --> 43:03.340]  It hadn't.
[43:03.660 --> 43:07.300]  The pool, the hose had exploded off the side of the thing.
[43:08.640 --> 43:13.380]  So the pool got about five minutes of water and then the ground got about 55.
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.680]  Just wasting water, just pissing water away.
[43:21.180 --> 43:22.180]  So I got annoyed.
[43:22.260 --> 43:23.040]  I just turned off the water.
[43:23.160 --> 43:24.600]  I thought it's probably going to rain soon.
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.380]  I'll just leave the pool.
[43:25.660 --> 43:29.380]  I think you have to keep it topped up because it's bad for the pumps if air gets in them.
[43:29.520 --> 43:31.100]  And if it drains too much, you get air in them.
[43:32.900 --> 43:38.760]  About two days later, I took a look at the pool and it was down by, instead of like an inch,
[43:38.920 --> 43:40.720]  it was down by about a foot of water.
[43:40.720 --> 43:43.280]  And I was like, Oh my God, how big is this leak?
[43:43.680 --> 43:44.700]  What's going on?
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.340]  I realized I never took the hose out of the water.
[43:48.700 --> 43:53.880]  So because the water level is slightly higher than the hose, I've been siphoning.
[43:54.580 --> 43:57.220]  The water had been siphoning out of the hose hole.
[43:57.620 --> 43:59.040]  You drained your pool.
[43:59.320 --> 44:02.640]  I drained my own pool for about two days.
[44:02.740 --> 44:04.800]  I was like, Oh my God, I've wasted even more water.
[44:04.880 --> 44:06.240]  What the hell's happening?
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.900]  And it didn't rain.
[44:08.920 --> 44:10.960]  Dude, the raccoon is going to be so pissed at you.
[44:11.120 --> 44:17.060]  The raccoon would be pissed because the little step he pisses on, washes on, is exposed to
[44:17.060 --> 44:17.880]  the air now.
[44:20.800 --> 44:22.200]  Gotta get this pool in order.
[44:24.000 --> 44:25.300]  He's not done, I bet.
[44:26.220 --> 44:26.460]  No.
[44:28.220 --> 44:30.240]  No, I wish I was done.
[44:32.080 --> 44:37.320]  This is probably something I can't show, but I can play the audio in the...
[44:37.900 --> 44:40.440]  in the episode and share my screen here.
[44:40.940 --> 44:42.380]  Okay, so it's night time.
[44:44.160 --> 44:45.020]  10.30.
[44:47.420 --> 44:47.980]  Wham!
[44:48.220 --> 44:51.320]  My freaking house just got EMP'd or something.
[44:51.560 --> 44:52.580]  All of my lights went off.
[44:52.580 --> 44:52.900]  What was that?
[44:53.120 --> 44:55.280]  Half the street lights went off.
[44:55.400 --> 44:56.980]  Fuck was that?
[44:57.140 --> 44:57.840]  What was that?
[44:58.260 --> 45:01.380]  My freaking air conditioner, which was just running minding its own business,
[45:01.960 --> 45:04.820]  started making the loudest noise in the world.
[45:05.020 --> 45:06.400]  The house was vibrating.
[45:06.400 --> 45:08.400]  I was... it made me jump.
[45:08.680 --> 45:10.160]  All the lights went off and then it went...
[45:11.400 --> 45:13.480]  And I was like, oh, what the hell's happening?
[45:14.220 --> 45:16.120]  Now my AC makes that noise.
[45:16.940 --> 45:17.360]  Always?
[45:18.040 --> 45:19.260]  When it comes on.
[45:20.200 --> 45:21.220]  Have you...
[45:21.220 --> 45:23.440]  Had it looked at yet?
[45:23.880 --> 45:24.860]  No, not yet, not yet.
[45:27.280 --> 45:28.580]  I've got the fans on.
[45:29.200 --> 45:30.740]  Ceiling fans full blast.
[45:31.280 --> 45:32.340]  Starting to get pretty warm.
[45:33.020 --> 45:37.240]  First, I thought my AC broke and like pulled so much power that all my lights went off.
[45:37.320 --> 45:40.460]  But then I noticed on the footage that like half the street went off too.
[45:40.660 --> 45:42.820]  So I don't know what that was.
[45:43.300 --> 45:44.040]  I think I do.
[45:44.300 --> 45:45.880]  I think I can solve this case for you.
[45:46.420 --> 45:47.100]  Real easy.
[45:47.640 --> 45:50.340]  You got a classic over the hedge situation going on.
[45:51.260 --> 45:54.620]  That raccoon was living its best life in your pool.
[45:54.880 --> 45:56.000]  It was having fun.
[45:56.160 --> 45:56.980]  It was swimming.
[45:57.440 --> 45:58.640]  It was enjoying things.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.140]  You're fucking up the pool.
[46:00.580 --> 46:01.760]  You're ruining it for him.
[46:01.760 --> 46:02.960]  He said, you know what?
[46:03.020 --> 46:03.880]  Go fuck yourself.
[46:03.980 --> 46:05.080]  I'm EMPing your house.
[46:05.240 --> 46:05.600]  Yeah.
[46:05.660 --> 46:06.960]  I'm biting into some cable.
[46:07.680 --> 46:08.400]  Everything's ruined.
[46:08.580 --> 46:09.580]  He chewed some cables.
[46:10.300 --> 46:11.420]  Oh, Gavin just went live again.
[46:11.560 --> 46:12.220]  I don't know who's that for.
[46:12.780 --> 46:13.640]  Oh, is this it?
[46:13.880 --> 46:14.700]  Oh, look at him.
[46:15.280 --> 46:18.080]  Oh, that's a guy who would chew on wires.
[46:20.020 --> 46:22.800]  Dude, that's a guy who would absolutely chew on wires.
[46:24.460 --> 46:26.320]  That's a wire chewing dude right there.
[46:26.800 --> 46:30.280]  That's a guy who's looking for an excuse to chew on wires.
[46:30.500 --> 46:31.560]  Yeah, 100% dude.
[46:32.060 --> 46:36.260]  Like he walked out of the house this morning looking to take something personally.
[46:36.860 --> 46:41.340]  Anyway, I'm looking forward to moving and not having a pool.
[46:41.840 --> 46:43.740]  I don't know why it's so much effort to store water.
[46:47.460 --> 46:50.500]  I think what's happened here is that Geoff sold his house.
[46:51.200 --> 46:52.240]  He doesn't have a house anymore.
[46:52.380 --> 46:55.160]  He's a renter, which means that's not his problem.
[46:55.300 --> 46:56.120]  I think that's what it is.
[46:56.140 --> 46:59.660]  Because last time when my house started getting all crazy, it was because Geoff's
[46:59.660 --> 47:02.140]  luck had gone, it started to go better.
[47:02.420 --> 47:04.700]  But I think now that Geoff doesn't have ownership.
[47:04.700 --> 47:06.740]  Yeah, and the problems need to flow somewhere.
[47:07.300 --> 47:08.940]  Are you done, Gav? Or is there more?
[47:09.640 --> 47:10.360]  That's it for now.
[47:11.480 --> 47:16.420]  What about the fucking, the seven billion gnats in your front yard?
[47:17.120 --> 47:20.260]  Oh, I didn't even remember that. I've mowed my lawn, right?
[47:20.440 --> 47:23.400]  And I just started leaving the clippings on the lawn.
[47:23.880 --> 47:27.300]  Just thought I'd try that out because my bin is full of rotten grass.
[47:28.020 --> 47:36.380]  And now there's probably, without exaggeration, 500 million gnats hovering above the grass.
[47:36.440 --> 47:36.900]  Oh my God.
[47:37.060 --> 47:43.440]  And maybe like 20 things fly, like dragonfly-ish sort of shaped things trying to eat them.
[47:43.980 --> 47:48.520]  So there's just a swarm of, an absolute war zone above my yard.
[47:48.840 --> 47:51.740]  I went to Gav's house to pick him up because I went to lunch the other day.
[47:51.880 --> 47:53.580]  And I didn't want to get, I didn't get out of my car.
[47:54.040 --> 47:55.460]  I took one look at it and I was like, I can't.
[47:55.460 --> 48:00.960]  It looked, when I was in the army, we went down to Panama and we had to camp on the Panama Canal,
[48:01.100 --> 48:01.860]  like on the Panama River.
[48:02.900 --> 48:07.560]  And it was like, you couldn't, you could like physically part the bugs through the air with
[48:07.560 --> 48:10.360]  your hands. That's what it looked like. It looked like Panama.
[48:10.840 --> 48:16.940]  It looked like a hundred degrees, a hundred percent humidity in the middle of a jungle.
[48:16.940 --> 48:17.720]  It was wild.
[48:18.140 --> 48:21.060]  I've Panama'd my fricking, I miss my lawn guy.
[48:21.780 --> 48:24.320]  You do? The one you fired so that you could be a lawn guy?
[48:24.320 --> 48:24.900]  Yeah.
[48:25.540 --> 48:27.120]  Do you think you'll be a lawn guy next year?
[48:27.680 --> 48:31.840]  I don't know. But at the moment I can't mow it without a bunch of shit flying into my sunglasses.
[48:33.080 --> 48:36.400]  Yeah. What does, what are you going to do about it? Like, what's the fix?
[48:37.060 --> 48:38.280]  How do you remedy this?
[48:40.620 --> 48:41.720]  Uh, I don't know.
[48:42.960 --> 48:44.540]  Maybe try early morning.
[48:44.860 --> 48:46.040]  It'd be like 6am mow.
[48:46.440 --> 48:47.340]  Kind of inconsiderate though.
[48:47.760 --> 48:49.340]  I don't know when all that stuff starts getting out there.
[48:50.040 --> 48:51.900]  Maybe try to flush them out with your pool water.
[48:54.640 --> 48:55.540]  Divert the flood.
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.920]  Maybe you should take a, maybe you should get like a blowtorch.
[49:01.820 --> 49:03.200]  Just try to cook them all at once, yeah.
[49:03.820 --> 49:04.980]  Oh, I like that idea.
[49:05.360 --> 49:06.240]  Seems extreme.
[49:06.800 --> 49:11.060]  Have you seen those videos where like they put the stuff on the grass and they light it on fire
[49:11.060 --> 49:12.340]  and it slow burns across?
[49:12.900 --> 49:13.380]  Oh yeah.
[49:14.080 --> 49:17.440]  I'm wary of any device that kills bugs because I think it will turn on me.
[49:17.760 --> 49:19.100]  And I think maybe a flamethrower might.
[49:19.460 --> 49:21.400]  If a flamethrower decides to explode, I don't...
[49:21.960 --> 49:26.760]  Yeah, I was gonna say, your luck this last week or whatever, maybe not so good.
[49:26.860 --> 49:31.080]  Also, you're no good with water, so I can't imagine fire is gonna be the move for you.
[49:31.400 --> 49:34.160]  I'm also no good with flamethrowers, I don't know where mine is.
[49:34.680 --> 49:35.360]  That's true.
[49:35.780 --> 49:36.340]  That's true.
[49:37.260 --> 49:38.340]  What is that powder called?
[49:38.900 --> 49:40.340]  What even, can you buy that?
[49:41.100 --> 49:41.800]  Is it just cotton?
[49:42.520 --> 49:43.200]  What is that?
[49:43.900 --> 49:45.620]  I've never questioned what that is.
[49:46.300 --> 49:46.900]  I don't know.
[49:47.480 --> 49:48.840]  The lawn fire stuff.
[49:49.480 --> 49:51.960]  I wouldn't want to... I mean, it's pretty dry.
[49:52.820 --> 49:54.980]  Yeah, it's a good looking yard.
[49:55.600 --> 50:00.460]  It's a good looking lawn when there's not the 10 billion gnats above it.
[50:00.920 --> 50:03.440]  Yeah, there's a bit on the edge that's been, unfortunately,
[50:03.720 --> 50:05.180]  contaminated with quite a lot of chlorine.
[50:05.460 --> 50:08.460]  It's not doing so well, but other than that, it's pretty good.
[50:10.500 --> 50:15.140]  Oh man, I feel like every year, every day, sorry, not every year,
[50:15.200 --> 50:18.320]  I feel like every day I don't own a house, I get younger.
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.520]  And now it's like I get to watch you guys all get older as I go the other direction.
[50:23.620 --> 50:24.160]  This is great.
[50:24.480 --> 50:27.040]  I have gone very gray since I've got this house.
[50:27.420 --> 50:28.360]  Fuck a house, dude.
[50:28.580 --> 50:31.600]  I actually went by my old house today, didn't miss it at all.
[50:33.200 --> 50:34.340]  Wasn't nostalgic or anything.
[50:34.460 --> 50:35.380]  Yeah, I rode my bike today.
[50:35.640 --> 50:38.120]  I was going to talk, I have a little thing, but I'll talk about it in the next episode.
[50:38.220 --> 50:42.880]  But I did that thing where a long time ago where I rode my bike and I just made observations
[50:42.880 --> 50:45.820]  about the world from my bike, you know, and things I noticed on my bike.
[50:45.900 --> 50:46.800]  I tried to do that today.
[50:47.160 --> 50:47.900]  Bingo, super great.
[50:47.900 --> 50:51.380]  But in the process, I went up to the old house for the first time in a couple,
[50:51.820 --> 50:53.520]  well, since I moved, I hadn't ridden my bike over there.
[50:53.660 --> 50:54.720]  And I was surprised.
[50:54.860 --> 50:55.740]  I didn't give a shit at all.
[50:55.820 --> 50:56.460]  I didn't miss it.
[50:56.500 --> 51:02.200]  I didn't feel like a tug of nostalgia or it wasn't bittersweet or anything.
[51:02.320 --> 51:05.440]  I was just like, yeah, it's weird how that how that works.
[51:05.620 --> 51:05.820]  That's great.
[51:06.280 --> 51:09.500]  I was hoping you went to your house actively to say, fuck that house.
[51:10.040 --> 51:11.040]  Fuck yourself house.
[51:11.440 --> 51:12.100]  No, I was happy.
[51:12.160 --> 51:14.000]  Actually, honestly, it looked really good.
[51:14.360 --> 51:17.280]  The new owner has taken is taking good care of the yard.
[51:17.280 --> 51:19.040]  I didn't expect him to.
[51:19.860 --> 51:21.600]  And we've been blessed with some rain.
[51:21.720 --> 51:22.600]  So I think that's helped, too.
[51:22.660 --> 51:26.300]  But I was impressed that the house looked well-kept and well taken care of.
[51:26.520 --> 51:29.160]  I just was surprised that because I lived there.
[51:29.260 --> 51:29.960]  I was thinking about the way home.
[51:30.060 --> 51:31.620]  I lived there for over five years.
[51:32.380 --> 51:33.180]  God, that's crazy.
[51:33.380 --> 51:34.420]  Seems so new in my head.
[51:34.980 --> 51:38.540]  Like Millie went through half of middle school and all of high school out of that house.
[51:38.640 --> 51:40.680]  It was a long time in a life, you know.
[51:40.900 --> 51:45.800]  But it's weird how you can move and just, I don't know, flush all that.
[51:45.800 --> 51:47.880]  Did you fill the beanhole before you left?
[51:48.480 --> 51:49.400]  Yeah, I did.
[51:49.860 --> 51:53.540]  And then I filled it a second and a third time because Albert dug it up.
[51:55.420 --> 51:57.140]  We didn't need the jackhammer after all.
[51:57.320 --> 51:57.900]  No, we did not.
[51:58.040 --> 51:59.380]  We just needed the bulldog.
[52:01.780 --> 52:04.060]  Should have left some beans in the house.
[52:04.240 --> 52:05.220]  Who knows? Maybe I did.
[52:07.140 --> 52:07.880]  Cast iron.
[52:08.540 --> 52:09.480]  Eric, how's your house doing?
[52:11.100 --> 52:14.720]  Thought I had everything solved and then had one of my breakers fail again.
[52:16.340 --> 52:17.140]  So bad.
[52:18.400 --> 52:20.600]  Maybe we both got EMPed.
[52:20.680 --> 52:26.480]  Yeah, I think that the... I think the breaker that I have is just...
[52:26.980 --> 52:28.680]  I think it trips really easy.
[52:29.560 --> 52:33.000]  And I just need to get, I need to call like the lifetime warranty line and then
[52:33.620 --> 52:36.860]  have them send me one and then have a guy come out and plug it all in
[52:36.860 --> 52:38.880]  so I don't plug it all in and have one backwards.
[52:39.100 --> 52:41.200]  And then I guess I assume kill myself.
[52:41.620 --> 52:43.560]  Is it just the breaker for one circuit?
[52:43.940 --> 52:44.460]  Or is it like a...
[52:44.460 --> 52:46.540]  No, no, it's the whole, like, it's the whole...
[52:48.180 --> 52:50.480]  Like, like the whole thing I think needs to be replaced.
[52:50.480 --> 52:51.160]  The whole subpanel?
[52:51.420 --> 52:53.740]  Yeah, yeah, like the whole subpanel needs to be like replaced.
[52:53.900 --> 52:59.080]  I talked to an electrician that was in my neighborhood and
[53:00.500 --> 53:03.240]  he's familiar with the setup and he's like, oh yeah, that has like...
[53:04.740 --> 53:07.740]  Essentially, it just came down to like these trip really easily.
[53:08.040 --> 53:09.840]  A lot of times it's not an issue.
[53:10.040 --> 53:13.480]  I've run into this here specifically where all these houses were built at like the same time
[53:13.480 --> 53:13.820]  and everything.
[53:14.360 --> 53:18.740]  And I just have to, have to make time to get a guy out here.
[53:18.760 --> 53:26.360]  But I spent 10 hours at our studio yesterday and for 100% eat and I just, I have not had time.
[53:26.720 --> 53:27.860]  So, trying.
[53:28.220 --> 53:28.660]  It's fun.
[53:28.800 --> 53:29.200]  It's great.
[53:29.820 --> 53:34.160]  Are EMPs like they are presented in the movies an actual thing?
[53:34.820 --> 53:37.280]  Has anyone ever actually been EMPed?
[53:39.720 --> 53:44.260]  Is that, we're talking about like things that happen in movies that just don't occur.
[53:44.560 --> 53:48.800]  I feel like there are a million more EMPs in fiction than there are in real life.
[53:49.120 --> 53:49.840]  Well, it's a real thing.
[53:50.060 --> 53:51.960]  I definitely didn't happen to my house.
[53:52.100 --> 53:53.400]  I was being dramatic, but.
[53:53.580 --> 53:54.640]  Yeah, I realized that.
[53:54.900 --> 53:55.420]  I understand.
[53:55.880 --> 53:56.120]  I didn't...
[53:56.680 --> 53:57.580]  Pulse electromagnetism.
[53:57.940 --> 53:59.480]  Just weaponizing an EMP.
[54:00.280 --> 54:04.020]  So, I think about it like in the context of movies, it's always so specific.
[54:04.020 --> 54:07.500]  But there has to be someone in the area whose switch just died.
[54:07.920 --> 54:10.080]  And they're just like, they have nothing to do with anything.
[54:10.720 --> 54:16.360]  Just a general, the idea of like being collateral damage to an EMP attack is really funny to me.
[54:17.300 --> 54:20.720]  It would just be so annoying and unexplainable.
[54:21.680 --> 54:22.800]  Do you think you would feel it?
[54:23.360 --> 54:24.580]  That's what I was wondering.
[54:25.420 --> 54:26.580]  I don't think I would.
[54:27.700 --> 54:28.560]  Why would you feel it?
[54:28.840 --> 54:32.300]  I don't think so either, but I just, it feels like, I don't know.
[54:32.300 --> 54:35.100]  Like maybe you're gonna stand up a little bit or something.
[54:35.660 --> 54:36.680]  Yeah, like, I don't know.
[54:36.740 --> 54:37.420]  Like you have a pacemaker.
[54:37.920 --> 54:40.060]  Yeah, like you'd feel it if you had a pacemaker.
[54:40.240 --> 54:41.660]  But I'm talking about just like in general.
[54:42.400 --> 54:43.480]  Like static electricity?
[54:43.920 --> 54:45.740]  Yeah, yeah, like it's that kind of a thing.
[54:45.820 --> 54:47.260]  Like how much does it really range?
[54:47.280 --> 54:49.040]  If it's like really strong, whatever.
[54:49.320 --> 54:50.380]  And then we'll get a bunch of comments.
[54:50.440 --> 54:52.500]  People go, I can't believe they thought you could feel that.
[54:52.600 --> 54:54.380]  Look, man, I don't know what it looks like.
[54:54.500 --> 54:55.260]  I don't know what it sounds like.
[54:55.280 --> 54:56.000]  I don't know what it is.
[54:56.440 --> 54:57.560]  Maybe if it's strong enough.
[54:58.180 --> 54:59.780]  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[54:59.980 --> 55:01.740]  Feeling my teeth, feeling my bones.
[55:01.740 --> 55:06.160]  I mean, it was pretty fucking strong for what it did to your house and half your street.
[55:06.500 --> 55:08.060]  Yeah, why can't do that?
[55:08.780 --> 55:11.180]  Maybe it would feel like X-Men 2.
[55:13.840 --> 55:14.280]  What?
[55:14.540 --> 55:15.200]  I don't know.
[55:15.420 --> 55:16.060]  I don't remember.
[55:16.420 --> 55:19.240]  I'm not, I haven't seen that movie enough to just know what that means.
[55:19.300 --> 55:21.760]  Oh, you don't remember how Magneto escaped his plastic prison?
[55:22.420 --> 55:22.800]  No.
[55:23.140 --> 55:25.120]  He pulls all the iron out of a guy?
[55:25.680 --> 55:26.080]  Yeah.
[55:26.640 --> 55:26.960]  Yeah.
[55:27.420 --> 55:31.600]  He makes like a little pinball out of a dude's iron.
[55:32.340 --> 55:34.200]  I would think I would remember that.
[55:34.380 --> 55:35.480]  That sounds awesome.
[55:35.740 --> 55:37.780]  To me, it's like one of the most memorable parts of X-Men 2.
[55:37.820 --> 55:39.960]  I definitely, I definitely remember that.
[55:40.180 --> 55:40.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[55:41.220 --> 55:43.740]  I think I was probably terrified by it when I saw it.
[55:44.140 --> 55:45.360]  I remember Nightcrawler.
[55:45.800 --> 55:47.600]  I remember thinking Nightcrawler was real cool.
[55:47.860 --> 55:48.300]  X-Men 2.
[55:49.120 --> 55:49.940]  He was real cool.
[55:50.880 --> 55:53.100]  And he's a great host on The Traitors.
[55:54.120 --> 55:55.120]  And he's invincible.
[55:55.920 --> 55:56.460]  Oh, yeah.
[55:56.940 --> 55:58.100]  Oh, that's an EMP movie.
[55:58.220 --> 55:58.640]  Goldeneye.
[55:59.440 --> 56:00.340]  Oh, that's right.
[56:00.340 --> 56:01.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:02.280 --> 56:03.520]  Nuclear explosion in orbit.
[56:03.720 --> 56:07.220]  You bring up a good point, Eric, of not, not knowing what it sounds like.
[56:07.680 --> 56:11.440]  Things that I think I know what they sound like, but only because movies told me.
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.860]  Like, I wonder, like, I have an expectation of what an EMP should sound like,
[56:15.860 --> 56:18.080]  but that is entirely informed by movies.
[56:18.900 --> 56:25.100]  And movie sounds are like a guy waving a tin roof into a fan.
[56:25.200 --> 56:25.820]  Like, it's not.
[56:26.820 --> 56:28.780]  It's the scanning of a grocery item.
[56:28.780 --> 56:30.920]  Wonder what else could possibly sound different.
[56:31.200 --> 56:33.840]  There's gotta be some cool stuff out there that we go, man, it sounds like that.
[56:33.920 --> 56:35.480]  That's, it's way cooler in person.
[56:35.480 --> 56:38.420]  But I think most of the time, everything sounds probably worse than in a movie.
[56:38.420 --> 56:39.100]  I think so.
[56:39.440 --> 56:39.660]  Yeah.
[56:39.660 --> 56:39.980]  I agree.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.380]  Hey, Gavin and I, Gavin and I did something.
[56:43.920 --> 56:44.700]  You did?
[56:45.260 --> 56:45.860]  We met up again.
[56:45.880 --> 56:49.320]  Yeah, we met up again the day I saw the Nats.
[56:50.540 --> 56:54.700]  We went and we had lunch together in a very public place,
[56:54.700 --> 56:56.540]  because that's the only way to do something like this.
[56:56.540 --> 56:58.080]  And then we finished.
[56:58.280 --> 57:01.600]  I'm happy to say 100% finished our smut.
[57:01.840 --> 57:02.860]  Oh, dang.
[57:03.240 --> 57:04.280]  How did that go?
[57:04.420 --> 57:05.080]  How was that?
[57:05.200 --> 57:06.620]  Whoa, really, really fun.
[57:06.760 --> 57:07.840]  I think it went really well.
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.400]  I don't think either of us remembered 80% of it.
[57:10.460 --> 57:13.320]  So it was as if we were reading it for the first time, which was fun.
[57:13.800 --> 57:14.080]  Yeah.
[57:14.300 --> 57:15.820]  Honestly, like probably 90%.
[57:15.820 --> 57:16.800]  I didn't remember.
[57:17.200 --> 57:18.500]  It's, it's something.
[57:19.180 --> 57:19.680]  It's something.
[57:19.840 --> 57:21.740]  It's about 10 pages.
[57:22.160 --> 57:23.320]  Real solid single space.
[57:23.460 --> 57:24.800]  It's 10 pages.
[57:25.080 --> 57:25.940]  We're not trying to get one over.
[57:26.900 --> 57:28.020]  On the teacher here.
[57:28.120 --> 57:29.080]  We didn't double space it.
[57:29.400 --> 57:30.660]  It's it's real long.
[57:32.300 --> 57:34.500]  And so are the wieners in the story.
[57:35.220 --> 57:36.700]  And yeah, we're excited about it.
[57:36.700 --> 57:37.620]  I don't know what to do with it, though.
[57:37.640 --> 57:38.240]  Now, I don't know.
[57:38.300 --> 57:39.880]  I don't like it's been so long.
[57:40.040 --> 57:44.120]  I don't know the best way to release this content into the world.
[57:44.460 --> 57:48.580]  Do we give it to the girls at the Clutch My Pearls podcast and then let them make an episode
[57:48.580 --> 57:49.020]  out of it?
[57:49.100 --> 57:50.680]  Do they even want to do that?
[57:50.980 --> 57:53.540]  Or do we do it over here for our audience?
[57:53.640 --> 57:55.260]  Is there are there multiple pieces of content?
[57:55.260 --> 57:58.720]  Do we just put the ebook up and let people read it if they you know what I mean?
[57:58.740 --> 57:59.060]  I don't know.
[57:59.160 --> 57:59.740]  I don't know.
[57:59.740 --> 57:59.980]  I don't know.
[57:59.980 --> 58:04.560]  My thinking was that we should try and do both, like give it to the Clutch My Pearls
[58:04.560 --> 58:08.760]  podcast if they want to do something with it, but also have a supplemental for us where
[58:09.400 --> 58:10.560]  Eric reads it to the group.
[58:11.680 --> 58:12.660]  I like that idea.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.560]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, I absolutely won't read it.
[58:15.600 --> 58:16.100]  But yeah, sure.
[58:16.160 --> 58:17.040]  I think this is a good idea.
[58:17.560 --> 58:18.340]  You won't read the smut?
[58:19.040 --> 58:20.520]  No, I don't want to read it out loud.
[58:20.520 --> 58:25.260]  Whenever I get an audiobook, I always enjoy it more when the author is.
[58:25.540 --> 58:28.960]  Dude, yeah, the author knows the intent and knows what's supposed to be said each and
[58:28.960 --> 58:29.380]  every time.
[58:29.480 --> 58:31.340]  Like, I don't know why you'd give it to someone else, man.
[58:31.380 --> 58:32.620]  It just feels like something you guys.
[58:32.640 --> 58:35.060]  They also can provide additional context like it.
[58:35.160 --> 58:36.020]  I enjoy it more.
[58:36.140 --> 58:38.720]  I mean, we could chime in, but it should be read by a third party.
[58:39.080 --> 58:41.880]  Yeah, I think it should be read by a third party, too, because you're getting to see
[58:41.880 --> 58:44.480]  their reaction as they discover it as the story.
[58:44.480 --> 58:46.160]  That's not how an audio book works.
[58:46.180 --> 58:46.880]  An audio book.
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.220]  I don't care what their reaction is.
[58:48.220 --> 58:49.260]  This isn't an audio book.
[58:49.660 --> 58:53.720]  This is a supplemental piece of content.
[58:53.780 --> 58:54.720]  It's regulation and supplemental.
[58:55.340 --> 58:59.380]  Yeah, I think, you know, if like Eric or I or Nick were to do it, we'd be so focused
[58:59.380 --> 59:02.560]  on that as opposed to reacting to it.
[59:02.940 --> 59:04.520]  Yeah, I think you want our surprise.
[59:04.740 --> 59:07.520]  You realize here, Andrew, we haven't asked you to read it.
[59:07.580 --> 59:09.000]  We're just asking you to read it.
[59:09.480 --> 59:11.980]  I think but I think Andrew understands what's happening here.
[59:12.260 --> 59:16.240]  And so I think he understands what's happening is that if you are too intransigent, we're
[59:16.240 --> 59:17.020]  going to move on to him.
[59:17.120 --> 59:18.500]  And he's trying to cut it off before we get there.
[59:18.760 --> 59:20.160]  But I do agree with Gavin.
[59:20.260 --> 59:24.000]  I do think it's more powerful if we don't read it and someone else does.
[59:24.360 --> 59:26.100]  I mean, I don't care if you agree with Gavin.
[59:26.200 --> 59:26.760]  That doesn't matter.
[59:26.860 --> 59:31.340]  I think it's important that the authors read their writing.
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.140]  So that way we get I mean, if we if we make an audio book version that will it will be
[59:36.140 --> 59:37.520]  performed by the authors.
[59:37.820 --> 59:43.020]  But right, which is what the the supplemental will be is that we can do that and then we
[59:43.020 --> 59:46.980]  can release it as an audio book for everyone to listen to.
[59:48.500 --> 59:50.360]  What percentage of it is fucking?
[59:50.940 --> 59:53.220]  Is there any like narrative?
[59:54.600 --> 59:58.760]  Uh, I would say the first seven pages are story.
[59:59.120 --> 59:59.600]  Great.
[59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.480]  That's great.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:02.280]  That's world building for sure.
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.640]  A lot of world building.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.320]  You need to understand the motivations.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.680]  You need to understand why they're in the position that they're in and the place that
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.000]  they're in.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.880]  You need to understand what the stakes are because they are galactic in scale.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.360]  Galactic is a good teaser.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.280]  And who better to make me understand that than the authors of this piece as they give
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.660]  it the gravitas it deserves.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.920]  How many characters are there?
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:33.860]  Why don't we just leave them, Geoff, with the the name and the.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600]  Uh, OK.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.720]  Uh, hold on a sec.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:40.840]  Hold on a second.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.130]  Let me find the uh, hold on.
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:44.440]  Give me two seconds.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:44.880]  Vamp.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.800]  This is why this is why the authors can't read it.
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.620]  I'd still, you know, this strawberry drink is still really good.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.920]  That's our pin name.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:03.540]  Yep.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:04.980]  I like, you know what?
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:07.380]  That looks more professional than I was expecting.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.820]  Yeah, I think that's vulgar.
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.700]  No, no, it's yeah, it it does read to me.
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.600]  It looks like a book I would grab in Starfield.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.040]  Does look like Starfield.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.460]  It, you know, it might feel a little bit like Starfield if that's your thing.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.720]  Yeah, sure.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.200]  I'll say I'll tell you this right now.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.840]  It has more aliens than Starfield does.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.760]  If you put into your browser, does it lead to our Patreon?
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.140]  I don't think so.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.790]  That would be awesome if it did.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:50.940]  I mean, we could get a domain and regulate it to the book.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:58.120]  Have you considered sending this book to any short story type festivals?
[01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.520]  Oh, for publication or to get it like reviewed.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.840]  See where it places, maybe an award.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.940]  I'm not opposed to it.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.520]  You probably get this thing a signal award.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:15.240]  It's a wholly original work of fiction that Gavin and I created from the ground up together
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.520]  under the moniker.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.320]  This is completely and totally from our minds and own.
[01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.060]  So I, you know, I feel pretty good about.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:26.300]  Putting it out there and seeing how other people feel about it.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.420]  Is it is it award worthy?
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.660]  Maybe last question, which probably wrap up after this.
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:35.460]  But Gavin, did you have your you're wondering your question
[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.480]  about glory holes before or after you wrote?
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:41.300]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.220]  You know, maybe I had a lot of stuff on the mind.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:45.780]  That's what I'm wondering.
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.020]  And it took me down a path subconsciously.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.280]  Yeah, you might be on something there.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.240]  Because I did think about this after I hung out with Geoff.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.900]  Are there any glory holes in the book?
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.520]  I mean, I don't want to just for the record.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.900]  I want to set expectations.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.520]  There are no glory holes in this.
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.600]  There are no artificial barriers to the sex they get.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:16.060]  They want to experience each other and well, everybody in the full regalia of of the moment.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.920]  Yeah, I don't know why my mind is in the gutter for this era.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:21.840]  But I think I think it's mostly on my system now.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.540]  I just had a couple of questions about happy endings and glory holes.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:29.820]  And that's about it until we win a Pulitzer and have to make a sequel.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.800]  Oh, last question.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:35.180]  Unrelated to this, going back to the glory hole.
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.720]  Wrap up this episode.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:43.080]  The premise of the stand, the cut out that you put your dick through the Tom Cruise hole.
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:44.280]  Yeah, the cruise hole.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.140]  Do you think the larger the character, the less impressive your dick would look?
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.360]  Yes.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.780]  So what if like you did like a Vern?
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:59.360]  What if there's a scale to test this like it's progressively larger bodies?
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.200]  Yeah, like on a dinklage, I'm looking good on like Victor Wiminyama.
[01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:05.800]  It's I'm comical.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:12.720]  As I was wondering about this, just as an aside, does height correlate to dick size?
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.520]  Like, does are they related in any way?
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:17.840]  I would assume.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.200]  I would think to an extent, right?
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:22.420]  But I have no idea.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:23.800]  I just have no clue.
[01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:29.080]  But I remember Steve, Stephen Merchant talking about his penis because he gets asked a lot
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.540]  if it's in proportion.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.720]  And his response typically is that he feels like he's been slightly shortchanged.
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.080]  Yeah, I mean, I've spent a lot my entire life listening to six foot five inch tall
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.160]  Howard Stern talk about how his penis looks like a robin's egg in a bird's nest.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.960]  So yeah, maybe it doesn't.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:52.500]  I don't know.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.660]  Find out next time on Regulation Podcast.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.580]  Oh, we went so long.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.400]  Andrew ended it.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:02.920]  I love it.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.140]  We'll see you guys next week.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.280]  We got two of them.
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.260]  Podcasts, not glory holes.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.520]  Thanks for clarifying.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:12.380]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:12.660]  Welcome.
[01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:16.540]  This is why I don't have a drill.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:17.700]  What a mess.
