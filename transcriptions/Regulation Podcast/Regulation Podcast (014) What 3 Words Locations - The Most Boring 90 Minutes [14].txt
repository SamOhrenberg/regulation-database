[00:00.000 --> 00:04.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:04.980 --> 00:10.300]  With me, as always, in order of importance from evens to odds this time, Andrew Panton,
[00:10.460 --> 00:18.820]  Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour. This is episode 14. It's supposed to be a weird one,
[00:18.860 --> 00:21.840]  but the last one was a little weird, so maybe it'll be a super normal episode.
[00:22.380 --> 00:24.600]  Is New York the only place that has a groove?
[00:25.820 --> 00:26.980]  I'm sorry, say that again, please.
[00:26.980 --> 00:30.420]  Is New York the only place that has a groove?
[00:31.220 --> 00:36.800]  Gavin yelled, I'm back, which immediately my head started, I'm back, back in the New York groove.
[00:38.060 --> 00:41.680]  I'm back. Is New York the only place with a groove?
[00:43.020 --> 00:47.460]  I've never heard of any other grooves. Just New York's.
[00:48.200 --> 00:50.020]  Famous groove. Let's see.
[00:50.020 --> 00:50.940]  Hmm.
[00:54.140 --> 00:56.400]  Many years since I was here.
[00:57.140 --> 01:02.360]  Yeah, there aren't a lot of groove locate, groove locate, famous groove location. How about that?
[01:04.140 --> 01:07.260]  I think it's maybe a market we could look into getting. I mean,
[01:07.260 --> 01:10.800]  we don't even have an intro song, but if we were to get into grooves,
[01:12.340 --> 01:13.860]  expand regional grooves.
[01:14.560 --> 01:18.280]  All signs point pretty extensively to New York.
[01:18.280 --> 01:23.740]  Yeah, that's a market we could get into. It's like, I don't know if you've seen
[01:24.340 --> 01:29.940]  there are these songs, maybe it was only Canada, but I'd assume it would be larger than that.
[01:30.220 --> 01:34.440]  There were these songs or was like Alberta is the place to be.
[01:34.620 --> 01:37.920]  And then it would be like listing all the great things about Alberta.
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.020]  And people would be like, oh, the Alberta song.
[01:41.580 --> 01:43.640]  Someone from Alberta, I connect to this.
[01:43.780 --> 01:48.180]  And then realizing that somebody just made that for every province in Canada.
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.140]  And that there's slightly altered versions of the same song.
[01:52.340 --> 01:55.160]  And they just sold them to different places.
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.300]  And how disappointing I think it was this American life about that.
[01:59.420 --> 02:00.640]  I want to say a long time ago.
[02:00.940 --> 02:03.200]  So people didn't realize until they moved to a different.
[02:03.720 --> 02:07.660]  That a person like realizing because it's literally the exact same song.
[02:08.020 --> 02:10.260]  And with a lot of the same shared words.
[02:10.660 --> 02:14.560]  But there's like sections where they localize it just slightly.
[02:14.780 --> 02:17.980]  And like reference like one or two specific things to that area.
[02:17.980 --> 02:21.460]  And so people being like very patriotic about like, yeah,
[02:21.620 --> 02:24.880]  this is a song about our place and how great our place is.
[02:24.980 --> 02:27.200]  And it exists because our place is great.
[02:27.280 --> 02:32.580]  And then realizing, oh, this person just manufactured and sold package.
[02:32.720 --> 02:35.540]  These songs for every area of Canada.
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.360]  I assume they go beyond that.
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.160]  That would be crazy if every country had the same national anthem, but with different words.
[02:47.980 --> 02:51.640]  Oh, man, I wish I had never done all the I've done the state songs.
[02:52.100 --> 02:54.420]  I was trying to think of like of the national anthems.
[02:54.640 --> 02:58.060]  What would be the best song to build around musically?
[02:59.580 --> 03:01.620]  It'd be an interesting thing, too.
[03:01.780 --> 03:05.060]  I should I should try to listen to some more anthems.
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.960]  Maybe the Oh, Canada one.
[03:08.860 --> 03:14.120]  Because it says the name like the US one doesn't say United States in it.
[03:14.220 --> 03:15.580]  No, I'm saying the music.
[03:15.580 --> 03:18.340]  Oh, like if you take the music.
[03:19.220 --> 03:22.120]  Of OK, I don't think the music in Canada is great.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.480]  I think the the American anthems are there's more going on musically than the Canadian one.
[03:28.920 --> 03:30.320]  You like a bit of Star Spangled.
[03:30.740 --> 03:33.960]  I don't really like any of them, if I'm being completely honest.
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.540]  As somebody who watches sporting events like it, I just I'm sick of it.
[03:38.940 --> 03:41.800]  I was sitting here trying to get pumped up by a bite in my head.
[03:42.020 --> 03:43.280]  And they're all just real boring.
[03:43.280 --> 03:46.140]  It's just real old timey music.
[03:46.300 --> 03:48.340]  There are some state songs that are bangers.
[03:48.420 --> 03:52.960]  I feel like there's probably some anthems that are surprisingly good, but not many.
[03:53.100 --> 03:56.040]  You're going through a lot of just the same to get there.
[03:56.180 --> 03:59.740]  I feel like we need a music refresh where maybe we're like,
[03:59.880 --> 04:01.640]  oh, it's classical music is classical.
[04:01.720 --> 04:02.480]  It's old.
[04:02.620 --> 04:04.080]  Let's let's fresh it up a bit.
[04:04.460 --> 04:05.700]  Let's put some guitars in there.
[04:06.080 --> 04:10.540]  I've hit it's funny, you know, like as you get older,
[04:10.540 --> 04:15.060]  there are different small milestones of like, oh, wow, I'm getting older.
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.640]  And like the first one I can remember is watching the NHL draft and realizing
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.800]  I'm a year older than all these people getting picked.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.100]  That was the first like, oh, fuck, I'm getting older.
[04:24.200 --> 04:24.700]  This is weird.
[04:25.100 --> 04:31.540]  I hit a new one recently where Avril Lavigne is releasing a greatest hits album.
[04:32.600 --> 04:37.800]  And it's the first artist that I'm aware of that I can remember buying their first CD
[04:37.800 --> 04:42.920]  and then having a full enough career to then warrant a greatest hits CD.
[04:43.340 --> 04:46.560]  That was a strange like, oh, fuck, time has passed.
[04:46.820 --> 04:47.860]  That is weird.
[04:48.700 --> 04:52.720]  I distinctly remember having the first Avril Lavigne CD and be like,
[04:52.780 --> 04:53.860]  skater boys, great.
[04:54.140 --> 04:55.120]  This is awesome.
[04:55.680 --> 05:01.520]  And to now get ads for her greatest hits, be like, oh, fuck, she has had a whole life.
[05:01.980 --> 05:03.820]  It has been a whole career of music.
[05:04.120 --> 05:05.140]  That's crazy.
[05:05.140 --> 05:12.160]  It must be so weird to live through that like career sort of decline until you become nostalgic
[05:12.160 --> 05:14.300]  and then all your music gets used again.
[05:14.540 --> 05:20.920]  Like Sophie Ellis Baxter or that was that one in Stranger Things, Kate Bush.
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.900]  Coming back to the front of just like, oh, my God, must be such a weird feeling.
[05:26.360 --> 05:30.440]  I remember reading an article recently that the band Yellowcard is huge again,
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.160]  and they were interviewing them and they were like, we have no idea why.
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.540]  We really don't know what's going on, but we're just enjoying it.
[05:37.580 --> 05:38.360]  We appreciate it.
[05:38.440 --> 05:40.040]  But yeah, like we had no fucking clue.
[05:40.840 --> 05:41.240]  So weird.
[05:41.920 --> 05:46.400]  It's interesting how social media and the Internet have really made that kind of thing
[05:46.400 --> 05:49.100]  possible in a way that it wasn't really in the past.
[05:49.200 --> 05:54.320]  You know, it's a lot easier to find things from the past and to latch onto them and have them take
[05:55.140 --> 05:58.280]  prominence in the in the present in a way that it didn't used to be.
[05:58.560 --> 05:59.640]  Sure, TikTok helps a lot.
[06:00.000 --> 06:00.200]  Yeah.
[06:00.640 --> 06:00.920]  Yeah.
[06:01.420 --> 06:01.820]  Oh, sure.
[06:01.820 --> 06:04.420]  90% of TikTok and Instagram.
[06:05.520 --> 06:10.220]  So I knew we were going to do two episodes today, and I mentioned this at the tail end
[06:10.220 --> 06:10.960]  of last episode.
[06:11.080 --> 06:12.740]  I've had a real boring life the last week.
[06:12.820 --> 06:13.360]  I'm real sorry.
[06:13.980 --> 06:15.260]  No house problems.
[06:15.380 --> 06:16.240]  God, I wish I did.
[06:16.480 --> 06:19.680]  I wish I had like some sort of a house issue I could share with you guys or whatever.
[06:19.680 --> 06:22.340]  But, you know, things are just working real good here for Geoff on his end.
[06:22.820 --> 06:24.600]  And it's been pretty bog standard.
[06:24.900 --> 06:28.860]  So I tried to I just haven't had anything interesting to talk about.
[06:28.860 --> 06:32.200]  So I did one of those bike rides where I decided today is going to be a bike ride where
[06:32.200 --> 06:36.000]  I'm going to observe the world and I'm going to take in everything that I notice and I'm
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.400]  going to find the interesting insights and things that are out there.
[06:39.480 --> 06:41.240]  I've done this, I think, twice before.
[06:41.360 --> 06:42.140]  Did it in face.
[06:42.380 --> 06:42.720]  I don't know.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.000]  I haven't done it in regulation yet.
[06:44.500 --> 06:45.840]  And here are my insights.
[06:45.900 --> 06:47.080]  If you guys are interested in them at all.
[06:47.260 --> 06:49.300]  Yes, I would love to hear them.
[06:49.780 --> 06:56.740]  I don't know what the little yellow triangle flags are on bike trails or in parks or like
[06:56.740 --> 06:58.060]  when they're in construction sites.
[06:58.060 --> 07:03.040]  But if I could figure out what purpose they serve, I think I could abuse it because I
[07:03.040 --> 07:03.980]  see them everywhere.
[07:04.120 --> 07:08.160]  And I think if I could get a hold of a bunch of them, I could use it to some nefarious
[07:08.160 --> 07:08.620]  means.
[07:08.720 --> 07:10.160]  I just got to figure out what they're doing.
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.500]  Do you have a picture of one?
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.780]  No, but I'll take a picture next time.
[07:13.880 --> 07:16.680]  Oh, I know that it's like the ones they use for gas lines and stuff.
[07:16.860 --> 07:19.580]  Like in my old yard, my old house, I had to get my gas lines marked.
[07:19.940 --> 07:22.200]  And a little thin stick with a tiny little.
[07:22.440 --> 07:25.420]  Yeah, like a little bendy metal stick with a vinyl flag.
[07:25.540 --> 07:27.460]  But they're everywhere, like in parks and stuff.
[07:27.460 --> 07:29.980]  They clearly denote stuff, but I don't know what.
[07:30.300 --> 07:33.680]  But I want to figure it out and take advantage of it, if that makes sense.
[07:33.740 --> 07:33.860]  Yeah.
[07:33.980 --> 07:35.480]  Eric's got a quick picture of them.
[07:35.480 --> 07:35.940]  Oh, these flags.
[07:36.420 --> 07:37.520]  Take advantage of it.
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.000]  What do you mean by that?
[07:40.740 --> 07:41.440]  I don't know.
[07:41.480 --> 07:44.520]  I got to figure out what they do so I can figure out how to use them to my advantage.
[07:45.040 --> 07:46.140]  See, you could potentially.
[07:46.980 --> 07:49.700]  I was thinking you could just draw people off the.
[07:50.040 --> 07:50.280]  Yeah.
[07:50.400 --> 07:53.860]  The regular path towards like a hot dog stand that you own or something.
[07:53.860 --> 07:55.200]  What if you you?
[07:55.380 --> 07:59.140]  Yeah, you funneled them towards your coffee shop or your smoothie shop or whatever.
[07:59.400 --> 08:03.060]  Or what if you just wanted a private section of park for yourself?
[08:03.280 --> 08:07.460]  Maybe you could just draw them all away and create like a little oasis for you.
[08:07.560 --> 08:08.460]  Who knows?
[08:08.860 --> 08:09.920]  Oh, Nick's got a great point.
[08:10.000 --> 08:10.740]  The lemonade stand.
[08:11.100 --> 08:11.740]  Lemonade stand.
[08:11.780 --> 08:12.380]  There you go.
[08:12.420 --> 08:14.340]  That's like that's a fucking great one right there.
[08:15.040 --> 08:15.620]  That's perfect.
[08:16.280 --> 08:18.140]  And even the flags are yellow like lemonade.
[08:18.360 --> 08:18.600]  That's right.
[08:18.760 --> 08:19.560]  Or pink.
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.260]  But then say.
[08:20.460 --> 08:21.120]  Or pink like lemonade.
[08:22.820 --> 08:23.980]  I got her twins.
[08:24.660 --> 08:27.480]  Say you start understanding what the flags are.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.020]  Nobody else necessarily knows.
[08:30.580 --> 08:34.540]  Like, I just assume they're just denoting like a line was laid under there or something.
[08:34.640 --> 08:35.360]  Like, I don't know.
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.100]  I assume more people than I assume that there are people out there that know what they mean.
[08:40.160 --> 08:42.940]  And whatever they mean, they mean like go this way or that way.
[08:43.040 --> 08:45.500]  I just figure they have a purpose.
[08:45.500 --> 08:48.840]  And if I could figure out what their actual purpose is, I could pervert that purpose.
[08:48.840 --> 08:51.960]  You know that, um, have you heard of the app?
[08:52.140 --> 08:55.340]  That's it's called something like what three something.
[08:55.460 --> 08:55.900]  What's it called?
[08:56.400 --> 08:56.880]  Three words.
[08:57.460 --> 08:57.940]  No.
[08:58.160 --> 08:58.400]  What?
[08:58.440 --> 08:58.840]  It would help.
[08:59.160 --> 08:59.220]  What?
[08:59.840 --> 09:02.700]  I think it's called what three words.
[09:02.880 --> 09:10.420]  And, uh, it's like segmented the earth up into different, like three by three cubes or something.
[09:10.680 --> 09:14.660]  But each one has a name made up of three words.
[09:14.660 --> 09:20.080]  And I wonder if you could find the square that's like best lemonade stand
[09:20.620 --> 09:22.700]  and like put the lemonade stand right there.
[09:22.900 --> 09:26.640]  So let me see if I can get this image working in here.
[09:27.320 --> 09:29.700]  Uh, I understand what he's saying.
[09:30.000 --> 09:30.240]  Yeah.
[09:30.480 --> 09:33.060]  It's it's segmented everything up like this.
[09:33.620 --> 09:34.140]  Yeah.
[09:34.180 --> 09:37.580]  Like the whole planet has three words attached to it.
[09:37.780 --> 09:39.060]  Words randomly assigned.
[09:39.060 --> 09:46.020]  Like the corner of on this image, Hyde Park Place is Price Buck Nurses.
[09:46.520 --> 09:46.660]  Yeah.
[09:46.800 --> 09:50.520]  So you could be like, you can meet me at Bird Inches Coast.
[09:52.020 --> 09:53.000]  Like meet me there.
[09:53.080 --> 09:55.660]  It's like a really specific spot on the planet.
[09:57.660 --> 09:59.340]  I've never heard of this.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.940]  I don't know what this is.
[10:01.420 --> 10:04.380]  I've never heard of this ever, ever.
[10:05.700 --> 10:08.980]  If you want to have someone deliver something to a pretty weird spot.
[10:10.300 --> 10:11.300]  And you can just...
[10:11.300 --> 10:12.080]  It's good for dead drops.
[10:13.040 --> 10:14.200]  Table decks bring.
[10:14.440 --> 10:14.660]  Okay.
[10:14.860 --> 10:17.540]  And they said they have the whole world segmented like this.
[10:17.920 --> 10:18.280]  Yeah.
[10:19.660 --> 10:20.380]  That's crazy.
[10:20.800 --> 10:23.440]  Like down to like your own toilet will be in one.
[10:23.780 --> 10:25.480]  You could be like, I take all my shits in...
[10:27.060 --> 10:28.320]  Bliss teeth exams.
[10:28.540 --> 10:32.020]  So then I just give you the name Bliss teeth exams and you type it into that search engine
[10:32.020 --> 10:33.300]  and it pulls up that spot on the map.
[10:33.800 --> 10:33.980]  Yeah.
[10:33.980 --> 10:35.040]  Give me a spot, Geoff.
[10:35.100 --> 10:37.860]  Like what's like an Austin spot and I'll see if I can find it.
[10:37.860 --> 10:41.800]  Like, I mean, I'll search it here, but like, we'll get like what the word is for it.
[10:42.080 --> 10:45.520]  Like give me like a place you go to or something like a restaurant or somewhere you like.
[10:45.820 --> 10:46.380]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:46.400 --> 10:46.840]  How about just...
[10:48.600 --> 10:50.520]  How about Desnudo coffee?
[10:51.160 --> 10:52.220]  Or is that too specific?
[10:52.320 --> 10:53.000]  Should I just give you a location?
[10:53.020 --> 10:53.980]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10:54.060 --> 10:54.880]  It's good.
[10:55.060 --> 10:58.280]  Desnudo coffee is...
[10:58.280 --> 10:59.260]  Hang on, I'm zooming in.
[11:00.720 --> 11:01.920]  Assorted back armed.
[11:04.680 --> 11:05.920]  Assorted back armed.
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.580]  This is crazy.
[11:07.580 --> 11:09.460]  I've never heard of this.
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.760]  Should we only communicate directions locally going forward in this method?
[11:15.740 --> 11:19.560]  Like I'll meet you guys at Banana Coast Strawberry or whatever.
[11:19.700 --> 11:21.380]  It's so secret.
[11:22.180 --> 11:26.300]  You can type in stuff that you think might exist and not all of the combinations do,
[11:26.480 --> 11:30.080]  but this is what I typed in for eat the pencil.
[11:31.440 --> 11:33.240]  And it's a place in Austin.
[11:33.760 --> 11:34.640]  No way.
[11:35.100 --> 11:36.100]  Oh, wow.
[11:36.100 --> 11:38.440]  Eat's Home Pencil is in the river.
[11:40.100 --> 11:42.700]  You had a jet ski to Eat's Home Pencil.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.960]  Maybe if it takes you to the local one.
[11:45.420 --> 11:47.680]  I rode my bike by there an hour ago.
[11:48.000 --> 11:48.880]  That's so funny.
[11:49.620 --> 11:54.000]  Yeah, so maybe if there's no exact match, it will find the nearest one to you that is similar.
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.060]  So that one had eats and pencil.
[11:57.620 --> 12:00.860]  We should try and find the most regulation square on the planet.
[12:01.420 --> 12:01.880]  Yeah.
[12:01.880 --> 12:06.500]  Yeah, maybe the listeners can help us with some funny combinations that exist.
[12:06.900 --> 12:07.680]  Oh, my God.
[12:07.740 --> 12:10.480]  We should find out what the center of the face universe is called.
[12:11.200 --> 12:13.080]  Oh, in Deputy Indiana.
[12:13.720 --> 12:15.820]  OK, let me see.
[12:16.480 --> 12:17.460]  Let me see right now.
[12:17.580 --> 12:18.400]  Deputy Indiana.
[12:19.120 --> 12:25.620]  And then, oh, my God, can we just make our I know if can we make our first T-shirt?
[12:25.680 --> 12:28.520]  Just be those three names, whatever they are.
[12:29.020 --> 12:29.520]  Oh, I love it.
[12:30.080 --> 12:34.160]  The problem is we have to figure out where the spot is in Deputy Indiana.
[12:34.380 --> 12:36.700]  And that is yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:36.760 --> 12:39.780]  Words because, man, it could be anything.
[12:39.880 --> 12:42.140]  It could be chain qualify leading.
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.180]  It could be international crackle description.
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.920]  You could go you can go to the it looks like the the cemetery that's right there.
[12:52.180 --> 12:54.560]  That's bribed vindicated songs.
[12:55.980 --> 12:58.340]  So I mean, there's a lot.
[12:59.660 --> 13:01.160]  Standard Ears face.
[13:01.600 --> 13:04.200]  Well, that is crazy.
[13:04.720 --> 13:05.720]  Say that again, please.
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.960]  Standard Ears face.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.220]  Yeah, it's in.
[13:08.360 --> 13:09.160]  What country is this?
[13:09.380 --> 13:10.300]  This is somewhere far.
[13:10.640 --> 13:11.540]  Oh, it's in.
[13:11.720 --> 13:13.060]  Oh, we're in China.
[13:13.120 --> 13:13.700]  We're in China.
[13:14.280 --> 13:14.780]  Oh, yeah.
[13:16.620 --> 13:19.840]  I thought Standard Ears face as a deputy for a minute as a loser.
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.180]  Oh, my God.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.840]  Dude, that would've been crazy.
[13:24.140 --> 13:25.100]  This is awesome.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.400]  I've never heard of this.
[13:26.400 --> 13:27.360]  Neither have I.
[13:27.880 --> 13:29.000]  Oh, yeah, it's a useful tool.
[13:29.460 --> 13:29.840]  Wow.
[13:30.420 --> 13:31.080]  Is it?
[13:31.500 --> 13:31.800]  Yeah.
[13:32.340 --> 13:35.640]  As long as both parties know, right?
[13:36.060 --> 13:39.680]  Well, I've done I've done shoots in some pretty obscure places where it's like just come to this
[13:39.680 --> 13:43.240]  square, like if you can't find the entrance to this forest or something.
[13:43.600 --> 13:43.880]  Totally.
[13:44.080 --> 13:45.320]  It makes complete sense.
[13:46.580 --> 13:47.680]  Dang, this is crazy.
[13:48.260 --> 13:50.020]  So how do you search by the by the names?
[13:50.800 --> 13:53.800]  You just type in you just type in names.
[13:54.120 --> 13:55.800]  Or three word address.
[13:55.800 --> 13:56.500]  Weird.
[13:56.700 --> 13:56.800]  Yeah.
[13:56.860 --> 13:59.900]  So like dog, fart, book.
[14:00.140 --> 14:01.300]  I don't think fart would be.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.880]  Fart is probably not going to be one.
[14:04.380 --> 14:06.180]  Dog, food, book.
[14:06.680 --> 14:07.540]  No address phone.
[14:07.780 --> 14:10.180]  That is so fucking cool.
[14:10.700 --> 14:11.380]  That is awesome.
[14:12.280 --> 14:16.120]  How often do you guys realize that you've misheard lyrics?
[14:17.400 --> 14:18.300]  Because I don't want a real run.
[14:18.880 --> 14:19.320]  Constantly.
[14:19.540 --> 14:20.020]  Okay, good.
[14:20.480 --> 14:20.800]  Glad.
[14:20.800 --> 14:25.740]  Mine today was Chicago's 25 or six to four.
[14:26.120 --> 14:28.820]  I thought it was 25 or six to four.
[14:29.460 --> 14:30.380]  Like numbers.
[14:30.540 --> 14:31.720]  I thought it was like a phone number.
[14:32.180 --> 14:32.900]  It's use.
[14:32.980 --> 14:34.520]  It's nonsense either way.
[14:34.980 --> 14:35.780]  Is it?
[14:35.980 --> 14:36.260]  Okay.
[14:36.380 --> 14:36.640]  Yeah.
[14:37.160 --> 14:37.780]  Are they what they say?
[14:37.860 --> 14:40.140]  It's either twenty five minutes or twenty six.
[14:40.160 --> 14:41.560]  Twenty five or six to four.
[14:41.820 --> 14:42.000]  Yeah.
[14:42.500 --> 14:43.900]  Twenty five or six to four.
[14:44.340 --> 14:47.000]  Like it's three thirty something.
[14:47.980 --> 14:48.200]  Sure.
[14:49.140 --> 14:50.000]  Yeah, sure.
[14:53.400 --> 14:54.020]  You know what?
[14:54.700 --> 14:56.420]  Well, you know what I was noticing on my bike?
[14:56.640 --> 14:58.580]  That doesn't mean what?
[14:59.120 --> 14:59.900]  Sorry, I forgot.
[15:00.040 --> 15:00.520]  We're on your bike.
[15:00.600 --> 15:00.660]  Right.
[15:00.880 --> 15:01.240]  What?
[15:02.600 --> 15:04.920]  We went so deep in that I completely forgot.
[15:05.100 --> 15:05.580]  I don't fucking.
[15:05.640 --> 15:08.100]  I don't think twenty five or six to four means anything.
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.200]  I think they're on drugs.
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.080]  Yeah, I bet it means.
[15:11.180 --> 15:12.440]  I thought they were telling the time.
[15:13.160 --> 15:15.720]  I think the whole song is about them being fucked up, isn't it?
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.460]  What does twenty five or sixty four?
[15:18.600 --> 15:20.740]  Yeah, they were like Nick says they were up late.
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.220]  On drugs, didn't know the time.
[15:22.760 --> 15:25.060]  Yeah, the time at which the song is set.
[15:25.120 --> 15:27.260]  Twenty five or twenty six minutes before four a.m.
[15:29.420 --> 15:30.240]  Doesn't matter anyway.
[15:30.340 --> 15:30.980]  Your bike ride.
[15:31.180 --> 15:32.640]  Tell me about what's so it's about.
[15:32.780 --> 15:34.200]  It's about those two times, maybe.
[15:34.500 --> 15:34.600]  Oops.
[15:34.880 --> 15:35.380]  No, that's wrong.
[15:38.600 --> 15:39.920]  I mistyped one of them.
[15:41.020 --> 15:45.580]  They're saying twenty five or twenty six to four o'clock.
[15:46.760 --> 15:47.080]  Oh, is that?
[15:47.200 --> 15:48.400]  No, I think that's what they're saying.
[15:48.460 --> 15:49.640]  Twenty five or six.
[15:49.640 --> 15:50.500]  Okay.
[15:50.980 --> 15:52.580]  Twenty five or six.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.400]  Got it.
[15:54.780 --> 15:56.920]  So what times would that be?
[15:58.020 --> 16:01.360]  Uh, twenty five, three, thirty four.
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.360]  Yeah, that was half right.
[16:04.580 --> 16:07.380]  So you almost got it when you edited, but it's wrong.
[16:09.000 --> 16:09.960]  It's pretty cool.
[16:10.520 --> 16:11.040]  There you are.
[16:11.100 --> 16:11.580]  Look at you.
[16:11.700 --> 16:12.740]  Hey, Gavin, way to go.
[16:12.800 --> 16:13.340]  Third time's a charm.
[16:15.440 --> 16:18.340]  Oh, God.
[16:18.340 --> 16:24.420]  I don't think the person who invented the picnic table gets enough credit.
[16:24.560 --> 16:28.860]  Do you think the guy that invented or I'm assuming guy because it's old?
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.600]  Um, that's a table.
[16:32.060 --> 16:34.200]  Well, I just I feel I don't whatever.
[16:34.320 --> 16:36.820]  The past is inherently misogynistic.
[16:37.260 --> 16:37.600]  Yes.
[16:37.840 --> 16:38.180]  Yeah, I get it.
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.400]  That was the point I was trying to make.
[16:39.700 --> 16:45.700]  Do you think they invented all of it or do you think they just combined like they didn't invent
[16:45.700 --> 16:48.240]  the stool or not stool?
[16:48.360 --> 16:51.200]  No, I think it was the here we go.
[16:51.400 --> 16:56.540]  The first known modern picnic table was documented in a 1903 patent application by Charles H.
[16:56.620 --> 16:58.600]  Nielsen of Chryslerville, New York.
[16:58.680 --> 17:00.040]  So that's what I'm talking about.
[17:00.100 --> 17:02.160]  I'd never heard of Charles H. Nielsen.
[17:02.300 --> 17:03.020]  Nobody has.
[17:03.520 --> 17:09.960]  But everywhere you go, there is a picnic table in nine times out of ten.
[17:10.120 --> 17:12.820]  It is the exact same fucking design.
[17:12.820 --> 17:19.900]  Like he landed on a standard regulation picnic table and the world just said, good enough.
[17:20.120 --> 17:25.140]  There's like there's the one that's metal that's got like perforated metal circles and it's like
[17:25.140 --> 17:25.720]  covered in rubber.
[17:25.840 --> 17:26.760]  You see those occasionally.
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.720]  But 99% of the time, it's that same bog standard wooden picnic table.
[17:31.060 --> 17:33.700]  We have not improved or innovated on that design.
[17:33.780 --> 17:39.740]  And like since 1903, I just think it's wild that we just all use it and they're everywhere.
[17:39.740 --> 17:44.640]  And nobody thinks about how we just have one kind of picnic table that we all just kind of adopted.
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.200]  So for it to qualify, is it just a table with benches attached to the table with an
[17:49.200 --> 17:50.100]  umbrella hole in the middle?
[17:51.080 --> 17:52.920]  I wouldn't even say it has to have the umbrella hole.
[17:53.840 --> 17:57.540]  Okay, so potentially the picnic table is a product of the New York groove.
[18:00.720 --> 18:02.660]  It's like one of the grooviest tables, maybe.
[18:03.380 --> 18:04.380]  Yeah, no, that's interesting.
[18:04.720 --> 18:05.360]  That's interesting.
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.440]  Is there a groove about the picnic table?
[18:08.480 --> 18:08.920]  Pfft.
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.220]  Many years since I've been here.
[18:11.260 --> 18:12.560]  1903 to be specific.
[18:13.380 --> 18:14.800]  You just don't ever think about picnic tables.
[18:14.980 --> 18:15.860]  But man, they're everywhere.
[18:16.040 --> 18:19.320]  I saw a bunch of dude, homeless people sleeping on them today.
[18:19.580 --> 18:21.620]  I saw a bunch of people having lunch on them.
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.440]  I saw some kids playing on them.
[18:23.660 --> 18:26.180]  I saw some dude working out of his laptop on one.
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.080]  And it's just like, they're just everywhere.
[18:28.500 --> 18:29.860]  Let me expand this, Geoff.
[18:30.180 --> 18:32.040]  I'm looking at my desk right now.
[18:32.380 --> 18:34.660]  I couldn't tell you who invented a single thing.
[18:35.580 --> 18:36.560]  Yeah, it's true.
[18:36.660 --> 18:40.640]  But I just feel like when you think picnic table, you think of this exact same...
[18:40.640 --> 18:43.620]  I would say most of us think of the exact same table in our heads.
[18:43.820 --> 18:47.320]  I just feel like it's weird that there's only like really one, you know?
[18:47.900 --> 18:49.520]  It's just like this accepted thing.
[18:49.680 --> 18:50.720]  And we just don't... I don't know.
[18:51.040 --> 18:52.720]  I don't even know where to buy one, but they're everywhere.
[18:52.980 --> 18:54.100]  Like, where do you go to get a picnic table?
[18:54.640 --> 18:54.980]  Home Depot?
[18:55.380 --> 18:56.400]  Who sells picnic tables?
[18:56.900 --> 18:58.020]  But somehow they're everywhere.
[18:58.460 --> 18:59.340]  Where do they come from?
[18:59.740 --> 19:00.340]  Who makes them?
[19:00.500 --> 19:02.220]  Who manufactures all these picnic tables?
[19:02.220 --> 19:04.440]  Do you think they were iterated from the blanket?
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.740]  Like people just got sick of sitting on the floor?
[19:07.340 --> 19:10.660]  Oh, do you think the original form of the picnic table is a blanket?
[19:11.240 --> 19:13.820]  Maybe before the 1903, they would just sit on the ground.
[19:14.340 --> 19:14.620]  Yeah.
[19:15.100 --> 19:17.500]  Do you think the first version, it was just a table?
[19:17.980 --> 19:19.360]  They're like, this doesn't work.
[19:19.780 --> 19:22.660]  We need to iterate on this.
[19:22.820 --> 19:23.440]  How do we do?
[19:23.900 --> 19:26.940]  It's just people sitting on the floor while their table is above them.
[19:29.400 --> 19:30.980]  This doesn't solve the problem at all.
[19:30.980 --> 19:32.940]  This is a huge mistake.
[19:34.360 --> 19:37.140]  Anyway, that was an observation I had.
[19:37.900 --> 19:42.040]  Also, I think that the city of Austin is in its graffiti flop era.
[19:42.620 --> 19:46.440]  The graffiti in Austin is very uninspired and kind of lame right now.
[19:46.740 --> 19:49.180]  All the Kung Fu grips and all the cool stuff are gone.
[19:49.300 --> 19:52.120]  And it's just a bunch of people writing shit over shit that somebody else wrote.
[19:52.320 --> 19:54.260]  And it just looks like a big mushy mess.
[19:55.100 --> 19:56.180]  What else did I learn?
[19:56.480 --> 19:57.080]  Oh, here's one.
[19:57.080 --> 20:00.120]  Every single person on Earth has a six pack.
[20:00.260 --> 20:02.080]  But Geoff noticed that today.
[20:02.260 --> 20:03.140]  God damn.
[20:04.560 --> 20:09.340]  I always thought when I was younger, I always used to look at people like Blaine and be like,
[20:09.440 --> 20:13.960]  Oh, I could probably do that one day if I really, you know, dedicated time to it and really committed
[20:13.960 --> 20:14.740]  to eating right.
[20:15.100 --> 20:20.180]  And now I'm 36 and I have to come to terms with the fact that every time I see Blaine,
[20:20.540 --> 20:23.040]  I just come to terms with the fact that that will never be me.
[20:23.540 --> 20:24.560]  That's what I've been saying.
[20:25.040 --> 20:25.400]  Yeah.
[20:25.760 --> 20:27.520]  I said that last week to you.
[20:28.280 --> 20:29.640]  That he'll never be Blaine?
[20:30.340 --> 20:30.560]  Yeah.
[20:30.780 --> 20:30.940]  What?
[20:31.680 --> 20:33.400]  You're talking about getting jacked.
[20:33.440 --> 20:35.300]  And I said, respectfully, who do you think you are?
[20:35.660 --> 20:36.880]  That's not a world we live in.
[20:37.320 --> 20:37.480]  Oh.
[20:37.620 --> 20:38.860]  I've been making that point for a while.
[20:38.900 --> 20:40.180]  I could have told you that back then.
[20:40.720 --> 20:41.400]  That's not you.
[20:41.920 --> 20:42.960]  It is weird, though.
[20:43.060 --> 20:45.400]  Like I spent two and a half hours riding my bike.
[20:45.460 --> 20:46.860]  About three hours riding my bike this morning.
[20:47.420 --> 20:52.520]  I ran into, I don't know, 2000 people on the hike and bike trail in that three hours.
[20:52.960 --> 20:56.080]  How am I the only one without a six pack?
[20:57.360 --> 21:01.000]  There are dudes 85 years old running in Austin with a six pack.
[21:01.080 --> 21:03.800]  There are women in their 90s with like 12 packs.
[21:04.140 --> 21:07.760]  There are fucking homeless dudes who look like personal trainers.
[21:08.080 --> 21:11.120]  Like everywhere I turn, people look amazing.
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.980]  And then my dumpy ass riding a bicycle.
[21:14.340 --> 21:15.840]  I just think that was an observation.
[21:16.260 --> 21:19.940]  And then my headphones died.
[21:21.140 --> 21:26.080]  And then I was real bummed because I was about 90 minutes into a three hour ride and my headphones
[21:26.080 --> 21:26.440]  died.
[21:26.860 --> 21:32.080]  And I thought, oh, maybe this is an opportunity to listen to the world around me.
[21:32.340 --> 21:35.880]  I just had this wild zombie cranberries experience.
[21:36.320 --> 21:40.480]  Maybe this is the universe saying, hey, we drained your batteries because something fucking
[21:40.480 --> 21:42.160]  fascinating is about to happen on your bike ride.
[21:42.180 --> 21:44.700]  And we want you to be alert for it, right?
[21:44.980 --> 21:49.840]  So for the next 90 minutes, I fucking, I just zoned into the world around me.
[21:49.840 --> 21:53.480]  I wanted to take in everything I could see, find anything interesting.
[21:53.680 --> 22:00.340]  And let me tell you, over the next 90 minutes, not a goddamn thing on the planet Earth
[22:00.340 --> 22:00.680]  happened.
[22:00.920 --> 22:03.820]  Not a sound of consequence was made.
[22:03.940 --> 22:06.680]  There was no point in listening to or hearing anything.
[22:07.120 --> 22:09.960]  It was the most boring 90 minutes on Earth.
[22:10.020 --> 22:11.260]  As a matter of fact, I was thinking about this.
[22:11.540 --> 22:16.560]  You could, if you could get some whiteout, you could just scrub out, just paint over
[22:16.560 --> 22:17.580]  that part of the timeline.
[22:17.580 --> 22:21.460]  I don't think anybody on Earth would notice or miss that 90 minutes.
[22:21.620 --> 22:25.540]  It was the most useless 90 minutes in the history of our planet.
[22:25.700 --> 22:29.500]  And that got me thinking, how much of our lives are useless?
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.060]  Eric and I have both been talking recently about how we're walking our dogs lately and
[22:33.060 --> 22:36.480]  about how much we like to walk our dogs and how much fun it is to walk our dogs.
[22:36.600 --> 22:38.800]  I'm walking my dog like three or four times a day right now.
[22:39.060 --> 22:41.700]  And Eric's walking his dog a couple times a day, I assume.
[22:41.840 --> 22:47.400]  And I got to thinking about how I spend time that way and how much I walk my dog and how
[22:47.400 --> 22:48.200]  that all bleeds together.
[22:48.620 --> 22:56.160]  And I bet if you took a 10 second clip of me walking Albert, maybe took all the 10 second
[22:56.160 --> 22:59.880]  clips of me walking Albert over the last two weeks and then jumbled them up and told
[22:59.880 --> 23:03.940]  me to put them in chronological order or you would kill me, I'd be dead in five minutes.
[23:04.460 --> 23:07.380]  So much of our lives are not worth remembering.
[23:07.860 --> 23:08.440]  That's all.
[23:08.620 --> 23:10.900]  That was my, that was my, uh, that was my observation.
[23:11.440 --> 23:15.080]  There was someone somewhere there losing their virginity in that time window.
[23:15.080 --> 23:17.140]  And you want to take that away from them?
[23:17.800 --> 23:18.360]  Not in Austin.
[23:19.220 --> 23:21.100]  They were doing, they were fucking doing nothing.
[23:21.240 --> 23:25.440]  They were, they were walking quietly and making no noise and doing nothing interesting.
[23:25.700 --> 23:29.160]  This episode of The Regulation Podcast is sponsored by Factor.
[23:29.640 --> 23:32.700]  Fuel up your gut with no prep, no mess meals.
[23:32.920 --> 23:38.260]  From a menu of chef crafted, fresh, never frozen, dietitian approved,
[23:38.620 --> 23:41.800]  little troughs of delight ready in just two minutes in the microwave.
[23:41.800 --> 23:47.480]  I assume Eric or Andrew have been sucking down the factors that were sent to us for this ad read.
[23:47.540 --> 23:52.420]  But thankfully my personal experience is I've been eating factors for about three years
[23:52.420 --> 23:56.060]  on my busier days of recording when I don't have time to make a full meal.
[23:56.340 --> 24:00.780]  It's incredibly convenient to go to my fridge and stick one of those in the microwave for two minutes
[24:00.780 --> 24:05.920]  as opposed to ordering in something much more expensive and probably less healthy.
[24:06.280 --> 24:07.420]  What's my favorite factor meal?
[24:07.720 --> 24:08.780]  It's none of your business.
[24:09.080 --> 24:10.500]  Andrew doesn't tell us his favorite apples.
[24:10.500 --> 24:11.920]  All right, you've twisted my arm.
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.660]  It's the jalapeno chicken.
[24:14.020 --> 24:15.040]  Absolute corker.

[24:51.760 --> 24:54.140]  Big thanks to Factor for sponsoring today's episode.
[24:54.500 --> 24:58.020]  How, you know, like multiple people die every second and get born and stuff.
[24:58.120 --> 25:01.260]  How often does someone lose their virginity?
[25:01.880 --> 25:03.920]  Okay, so you're still on like this weirdo guy.
[25:03.980 --> 25:08.300]  So yeah, you get just real double, triple down on the weird this episode.
[25:08.500 --> 25:09.040]  Is that weird?
[25:09.600 --> 25:10.300]  Yeah, it is.
[25:10.580 --> 25:11.160]  It's a stat.
[25:11.420 --> 25:13.600]  Yeah, but it's not a fun.
[25:13.960 --> 25:17.280]  There's a lot of bad directions to take that stat.
[25:17.800 --> 25:20.000]  All I'm saying is...
[25:20.920 --> 25:23.020]  It is a stat I would not want to explore.
[25:23.580 --> 25:26.700]  Without Gavin getting all weird and sexual about it.
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.300]  I just, it got me thinking about how much of our lives we are just kind of don't matter.
[25:32.520 --> 25:36.580]  And that if you just like fucking mind wipe them with the men in black pen,
[25:36.640 --> 25:37.620]  you wouldn't even notice.
[25:38.140 --> 25:40.660]  I don't even remember what clothes I was wearing two days ago.
[25:40.760 --> 25:43.560]  How would I remember which dog walk it was, you know?
[25:43.640 --> 25:46.560]  It's why TV episodes are 42 minutes long, Geoff.
[25:46.860 --> 25:51.000]  It's really hard to have a bunch of interesting stuff happen in a sequence.
[25:51.500 --> 25:56.240]  You would think in the middle of the 11th largest city in America for 90 minutes
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.660]  in public, riding through downtown and all over the city,
[25:59.980 --> 26:02.280]  that one thing would happen.
[26:02.990 --> 26:08.640]  Well, it's the issue of what is regular becomes mundane, right?
[26:10.540 --> 26:13.280]  Maybe it's a perspective thing of what is interesting.
[26:13.700 --> 26:15.900]  You've been in Austin for such a long time.
[26:16.240 --> 26:16.940]  It's a lot of the same.
[26:17.080 --> 26:18.720]  I mean, Austin's always changing, but like,
[26:19.120 --> 26:21.760]  I feel like it's a city you're very familiar with, obviously.
[26:22.420 --> 26:26.900]  I think maybe what would be unique or interesting to you is a narrower range
[26:26.900 --> 26:30.020]  than if you were just visiting Austin for the first time.
[26:30.020 --> 26:33.360]  I understand what you're saying,
[26:33.460 --> 26:36.640]  but I was evaluating it on a more of a,
[26:36.900 --> 26:39.600]  just I need to come up with something silly to talk about.
[26:39.680 --> 26:41.520]  And there's just like, you know what I mean?
[26:41.520 --> 26:44.660]  Like I was, I don't think I was looking at it through an Austinite's eyes
[26:44.660 --> 26:45.520]  and more of a just like,
[26:45.540 --> 26:48.820]  could somebody trip or like have some poop on the back of their shorts,
[26:48.820 --> 26:53.180]  or maybe somebody get into a yelling match on their phone while they're walking,
[26:53.740 --> 26:54.700]  or you know what I mean?
[26:54.800 --> 26:56.860]  Like anything, maybe somebody bumps somebody,
[26:56.960 --> 26:59.840]  somebody gets a flat tire on their bike and I can stop and help them or something.
[26:59.840 --> 27:01.160]  Just anything, you know?
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.720]  Or someone's trailing a gas pump.
[27:03.060 --> 27:05.940]  Or someone's trailing a gas pump, exactly.
[27:06.240 --> 27:09.040]  I didn't see a single car trailing a single gas pump.
[27:09.520 --> 27:12.480]  You said that your headphones died.
[27:12.840 --> 27:16.720]  And I really appreciate headphone technology now,
[27:16.840 --> 27:19.100]  like Bluetooth, whatever, wireless, all that stuff.
[27:19.520 --> 27:22.460]  I stay on top of charging all my stuff.
[27:22.660 --> 27:24.780]  I make sure everything's good to go all the time,
[27:25.140 --> 27:27.520]  except my wireless headphones.
[27:27.520 --> 27:30.740]  And I don't know why that is,
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.340]  but I can't think of a time that I get madder
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.860]  than when I'm about to do this thing,
[27:36.980 --> 27:38.480]  like mow my lawn or whatever,
[27:38.780 --> 27:41.180]  put in the headphones, they connect,
[27:41.280 --> 27:43.460]  and then like immediately die.
[27:43.640 --> 27:46.800]  And now I don't know what, like, what's the plan.
[27:47.280 --> 27:50.120]  Well, to be honest, you could probably just charge them for like four minutes
[27:50.120 --> 27:51.560]  and there would be enough to mow a lawn.
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.160]  I, uh, the lawn was an example.
[27:55.720 --> 27:59.280]  It could be, it could be any number of activities.
[27:59.940 --> 28:03.560]  I wasn't looking to solve one individual thing.
[28:03.880 --> 28:05.120]  That was just an example.
[28:05.500 --> 28:07.080]  In general, the batteries are tiny.
[28:07.180 --> 28:08.120]  They charge very fast.
[28:08.820 --> 28:10.060]  When you're running out the door,
[28:10.280 --> 28:12.020]  you may not have time to charge them.
[28:12.220 --> 28:15.620]  It's just, it's, it's that kind of a thing where it's just like,
[28:15.660 --> 28:19.220]  I don't, I don't know why it's the only device that I own
[28:19.220 --> 28:20.600]  where that stuff happens.
[28:21.220 --> 28:23.300]  And it makes me so fucking mad.
[28:23.500 --> 28:24.840]  Are they annoying to charge?
[28:25.160 --> 28:26.740]  No, I mean, they're just, they're, it's AirPods.
[28:27.160 --> 28:27.940]  So they're fine.
[28:28.360 --> 28:32.740]  It's, but it's on, I, I have the iPhone with the USB-C.
[28:32.860 --> 28:36.980]  So I have to find the USB other thing, lightning or whatever, to charge.
[28:37.140 --> 28:38.760]  And it's just like, this sucks.
[28:38.880 --> 28:39.920]  It fucking sucks shit.
[28:40.220 --> 28:40.660]  I hate it.
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.040]  Do you have any wireless ones?
[28:42.820 --> 28:43.560]  He just said he had AirPods.
[28:44.080 --> 28:45.540]  Not like wireless, wireless charger?
[28:46.320 --> 28:47.800]  No, no, just in my car.
[28:48.180 --> 28:50.120]  Oh, I have a wireless charger.
[28:50.200 --> 28:50.680]  They're not great.
[28:50.980 --> 28:54.620]  Um, I'm actually in a bit of headphone hell right now.
[28:54.620 --> 28:56.520]  Which is part of, part of the problem.
[28:57.140 --> 29:00.220]  My, my AirPods just fucking died.
[29:00.480 --> 29:03.240]  Like they just stopped syncing to anything.
[29:03.540 --> 29:06.240]  You cannot factory reset everything you can do.
[29:06.320 --> 29:08.940]  You just cannot, they just will not sync to an item.
[29:09.300 --> 29:12.860]  No, no matter how charged they are, no matter how many times I go through it, I try to do it.
[29:12.900 --> 29:13.960]  They just won't fucking sync.
[29:14.500 --> 29:18.600]  And so I was borrowing Emily's for, oh gosh, about two months there.
[29:18.620 --> 29:20.520]  And then eventually I think she got sick of it.
[29:20.620 --> 29:22.180]  Now I just can't find Emily's anymore.
[29:22.280 --> 29:23.180]  They're suddenly not around.
[29:23.820 --> 29:29.960]  And so the other day at the airport, I bought a pair of like $30 fake AirPods, you know,
[29:29.960 --> 29:33.240]  and they'd been fine up until today.
[29:33.400 --> 29:36.840]  I, and I, Eric, I fully charge, they're supposed to have five hour battery life.
[29:36.840 --> 29:40.560]  And I fully charged them before the bike ride and they died 90 minutes in.
[29:40.780 --> 29:43.160]  And I would rather, I would like to just go buy new AirPods,
[29:43.460 --> 29:46.060]  but they're announcing new AirPods in September or August.
[29:46.060 --> 29:50.040]  And so I don't want to spend 190 bucks or however much they fucking cost, 300 bucks,
[29:50.040 --> 29:54.000]  to then have them be obsolete or to be able to buy the current generation
[29:54.000 --> 29:56.220]  for a hundred bucks off or whatever, because there's a new, you know what I mean?
[29:56.520 --> 29:57.640]  So I just got to fucking wait.
[29:57.720 --> 30:01.320]  And I'm in this weird headphone holding period where I can't find my wife's headphones
[30:01.320 --> 30:04.740]  because I think she's sick of letting me borrow them, which I totally understand.
[30:04.980 --> 30:08.720]  I did find Millie's AirPods, but Millie's left ear is blown out.
[30:08.780 --> 30:10.360]  So I can't use those. They're fucking terrible.
[30:10.600 --> 30:15.380]  I got my own pair of AirPods that about once a week I sit down and try to make work again
[30:15.380 --> 30:19.660]  in a futile effort of thinking like maybe time fixed the problem and it never does.
[30:19.660 --> 30:21.780]  And then these cheap ones that I thought worked,
[30:21.900 --> 30:24.820]  now I apparently only have a 90 minute battery life, which fucking sucks
[30:24.820 --> 30:26.540]  because they advertised five hours.
[30:26.620 --> 30:28.940]  But what am I going to do? I paid 30 bucks for them.
[30:29.060 --> 30:32.000]  And it's August 1st, so I just got to wait.
[30:32.180 --> 30:35.020]  I just got to wait until Apple tells me I can buy a new thing.
[30:35.540 --> 30:38.780]  I had the exact same thing like a year ago where one of my AirPods,
[30:39.640 --> 30:44.880]  I'd had two different ones because one of them, the left ear went really quiet
[30:44.880 --> 30:49.760]  and I would have to like manually change the balance of left and right
[30:49.760 --> 30:52.300]  to make them even out until eventually it got too quiet to use.
[30:52.600 --> 30:57.080]  So then I bought another pair and I lost the left, I lost the right AirPod.
[30:57.340 --> 31:04.340]  So I ended up combining one of each pair in the same box, but it freaking hates that.
[31:04.740 --> 31:08.240]  And the only way to get them to work is then I pair my AirPods to it
[31:08.240 --> 31:11.340]  and then I have to share my audio with the other AirPod.
[31:11.340 --> 31:15.400]  And it's just, it was an annoying shit show for about six months.
[31:15.540 --> 31:17.660]  And I just should have bought another pair of them.
[31:17.700 --> 31:21.580]  I just refused because I already had two and I couldn't get a single good listening experience.
[31:22.860 --> 31:28.020]  I hate that kind of limbo living where to save 200 bucks or whatever,
[31:28.120 --> 31:30.580]  you just put yourself through months of inconvenience.
[31:31.020 --> 31:33.120]  I do it all the time for no reason.
[31:33.500 --> 31:37.960]  When it's all said and done, I will have gone through five months of bullshit
[31:38.700 --> 31:43.420]  to get a new pair of headphones just to save a couple hundred bucks.
[31:43.660 --> 31:46.240]  Yeah, it's fucking stupid, but it is what it is.
[31:46.480 --> 31:47.380]  This is where we are.
[31:47.600 --> 31:52.420]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm too fucking close to the end of the road
[31:52.420 --> 31:55.880]  to break now and buy the headphones in a moment of desperation.
[31:55.940 --> 31:57.980]  I'm just going to soldier fucking through.
[31:58.060 --> 31:59.020]  It just sucks.
[31:59.440 --> 32:00.900]  Yeah, you gotta stick with it.
[32:01.480 --> 32:01.660]  Yeah.
[32:02.240 --> 32:04.020]  And then something will pop up in your house where it's like,
[32:04.060 --> 32:06.240]  now my air conditioner is busted because of the EMP.
[32:06.240 --> 32:08.820]  So I'm probably going to have to spend like eight airpods
[32:09.400 --> 32:11.080]  worth of money on just getting that.
[32:11.280 --> 32:12.160]  Ugh, yep.
[32:13.420 --> 32:15.380]  I can't imagine not having AC in Austin.
[32:16.280 --> 32:16.640]  Terrible.
[32:16.780 --> 32:18.100]  Yeah, it's not good.
[32:18.860 --> 32:19.500]  That would not be good.
[32:20.000 --> 32:23.360]  Going back to your point, Geoff, about six packs and everyone has them but you.
[32:24.040 --> 32:25.640]  It made me think, I looked it up.
[32:25.740 --> 32:28.820]  Well, you're saying that because you're, you know, it sounded like you were like,
[32:28.900 --> 32:30.100]  damn, why don't I have one of those?
[32:30.700 --> 32:32.380]  You know, you can have up to a 12 pack.
[32:33.340 --> 32:35.300]  I don't know that I want one.
[32:35.300 --> 32:38.700]  I just noticed that everybody has one but me.
[32:38.980 --> 32:40.720]  Well, I'm just, I'm throwing it out there.
[32:41.140 --> 32:42.680]  You can go up to 12, apparently.
[32:43.480 --> 32:43.660]  Yeah.
[32:44.340 --> 32:45.680]  Where are these people slacking?
[32:46.280 --> 32:47.180]  They're only halfway there.
[32:47.240 --> 32:47.620]  Where did the four come from?
[32:47.700 --> 32:49.560]  Are they like above and below the regular six?
[32:49.880 --> 32:50.600]  What do you mean 12?
[32:50.600 --> 32:51.180]  I don't know.
[32:51.580 --> 32:55.180]  I looked up, can, is there more than a six pack?
[32:55.320 --> 32:58.680]  Which led me to an eight pack, which then led me to a 10 pack,
[32:58.820 --> 33:02.120]  which then led me to a thing that said you could have at most a 12 pack.
[33:02.380 --> 33:03.480]  25 or six pack?
[33:04.420 --> 33:04.820]  Yeah.
[33:06.720 --> 33:08.140]  It's a 332 pack.
[33:09.480 --> 33:12.000]  Somewhere between 334 and 335 pack.
[33:13.300 --> 33:16.440]  I'm just saying, if you're looking at everybody else that has one,
[33:17.680 --> 33:19.120]  there's a lot more they could go for.
[33:19.680 --> 33:20.180]  That's true.
[33:20.460 --> 33:21.500]  They're slacking at six.
[33:21.660 --> 33:25.500]  So most people who have a lovely six pack, they have the half the pack.
[33:25.720 --> 33:27.020]  They're only halfway there.
[33:27.420 --> 33:29.580]  You know what? I'm not going to call it a six pack anymore.
[33:29.720 --> 33:32.780]  I'm going to call it a six slack and it's going to be derogatory.
[33:33.340 --> 33:34.320]  Yeah, the half pack.
[33:34.880 --> 33:36.440]  I didn't know you could go to 12.
[33:36.660 --> 33:37.280]  That's insane.
[33:37.400 --> 33:37.820]  I don't know.
[33:38.120 --> 33:38.820]  I can't imagine.
[33:39.780 --> 33:41.260]  It's probably like a bodybuilder.
[33:41.520 --> 33:44.100]  As you said, like, I don't know where the 12 comes into place.
[33:44.560 --> 33:49.200]  I think by looking at Blaine recently and just deciding I'm giving up on my body,
[33:49.340 --> 33:53.480]  maybe I should just take it the other way and have it spur me on to try and get one.
[33:53.620 --> 33:54.760]  Just one time in my life.
[33:54.800 --> 33:57.520]  I wouldn't be able to maintain it, but maybe I'll be able to get to it.
[33:58.720 --> 33:59.320]  Do it.
[33:59.800 --> 33:59.920]  Yeah.
[34:00.180 --> 34:00.700]  Andrew laughed.
[34:00.760 --> 34:02.540]  He thinks, do you think I can't do it?
[34:02.540 --> 34:03.340]  Do I?
[34:03.500 --> 34:07.740]  I was laughing just because I was imagining, you know, like Gerard Butler for 300
[34:07.740 --> 34:11.300]  and how ripped he was for that window of time.
[34:11.780 --> 34:16.620]  Like, it's you holding on like it's an actor taking on an action role
[34:16.620 --> 34:20.600]  and then just like they go back to what they their typical frame is.
[34:21.060 --> 34:23.060]  You could be the next Kamail Nanjani.
[34:23.680 --> 34:24.560]  No, he's maintained.
[34:24.780 --> 34:25.900]  He's like he has maintained.
[34:25.960 --> 34:28.560]  I think that's like his lifestyle now, it seems.
[34:29.500 --> 34:31.780]  I went shoe shopping the other day with my wife.
[34:31.780 --> 34:33.700]  Well, she went shoe shopping and I went with her.
[34:34.220 --> 34:36.660]  And I was looking at shoes that I thought were interesting.
[34:36.960 --> 34:38.520]  And she asked me what shoe size I was.
[34:38.820 --> 34:40.960]  And I said I was a 10-30.
[34:41.240 --> 34:47.920]  And then I realized that that broke my fucking brain for about a minute.
[34:48.060 --> 34:53.240]  I had to sit down and understand how that was wrong and right at the same time.
[34:53.320 --> 34:56.200]  And why it felt so wrong, but also so right to say.
[34:56.340 --> 34:57.640]  And what the fuck I was...
[34:57.640 --> 34:59.320]  And it took me a minute to unpack.
[34:59.320 --> 35:03.260]  I really broke my head for a minute trying to figure out...
[35:03.260 --> 35:04.620]  You got confused with a clock.
[35:05.060 --> 35:06.840]  Yeah, where I'm a 10 and a half.
[35:07.240 --> 35:09.980]  And in my head, that translated to 10-30.
[35:10.080 --> 35:12.680]  And I saw a clock in my head and that was right somehow.
[35:12.680 --> 35:13.880]  But I knew it wasn't right.
[35:13.900 --> 35:15.180]  And I couldn't figure out why.
[35:15.400 --> 35:17.700]  And she looked at me like I was extra dumb.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.440]  And I just, oh, man, I had a moment where I was just like,
[35:20.600 --> 35:21.700]  I was really confused by me.
[35:21.800 --> 35:22.520]  Have you guys ever done that?
[35:23.340 --> 35:23.740]  No.
[35:24.840 --> 35:27.220]  Maybe Chicago were just confused about their shoe size.
[35:29.920 --> 35:31.500]  I'm a 15 minutes to two.
[35:35.300 --> 35:38.720]  It is weird to have to think of 30 as being 50, basically.
[35:38.720 --> 35:39.120]  Yes.
[35:39.280 --> 35:39.960]  In a lot of scenarios.
[35:40.700 --> 35:41.180]  It is.
[35:41.760 --> 35:43.240]  It can definitely trip you up.
[35:43.540 --> 35:47.480]  Got my unit of measurement all confused with my unit of time.
[35:48.180 --> 35:48.880]  Oh, man.
[35:49.320 --> 35:50.660]  This is what your 40s...
[35:50.660 --> 35:52.240]  This is what you have to look forward to in your 40s, guys.
[35:52.600 --> 35:53.480]  Oh, I can't wait.
[35:54.620 --> 35:59.940]  You just hot takes on picnic benches and fucking confusing units of measurement.
[36:01.880 --> 36:04.460]  I would look into sending you a picnic bench,
[36:04.520 --> 36:05.580]  but you don't own a house now,
[36:05.600 --> 36:08.740]  which makes me realize I feel less comfortable sending you stuff like that.
[36:08.860 --> 36:09.900]  I'd have nowhere to put it.
[36:10.240 --> 36:11.420]  Yeah, it's sad.
[36:12.020 --> 36:16.660]  It's I do feel like a certain amount of safety in renting now from you specifically.
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.540]  I had a thought.
[36:21.240 --> 36:22.480]  I eat a lot of chicken.
[36:22.920 --> 36:25.100]  It's probably the food I've consumed the most of.
[36:26.060 --> 36:27.720]  I was wondering how many chickens I've killed.
[36:28.780 --> 36:33.740]  Not directly, but any time I've consumed chicken, that chicken has died.
[36:34.400 --> 36:36.620]  I think I probably kill 100 chickens a year,
[36:37.020 --> 36:40.840]  I would say, based on the frequency at which I'm eating chickens.
[36:41.480 --> 36:44.000]  If you had to kill them by hand, do you think you would eat as many?
[36:44.700 --> 36:46.240]  Uh, oh, that's a...
[36:46.240 --> 36:46.800]  Yeah, I think so.
[36:46.820 --> 36:49.120]  I think the first few would probably be tough,
[36:49.460 --> 36:51.240]  and then I would get past it really quick.
[36:51.240 --> 36:54.180]  You'd just be yanking on chicken heads every week.
[36:54.260 --> 36:57.400]  Yeah, yeah, I think because that's what people do.
[36:57.500 --> 37:02.420]  Like, I think it's once you are familiar with that process and get used to it.
[37:02.560 --> 37:03.560]  That's just life.
[37:03.720 --> 37:04.700]  I just couldn't do it.
[37:05.180 --> 37:06.760]  No, I think the first one.
[37:06.920 --> 37:07.980]  No, I'm with you, too.
[37:08.500 --> 37:12.780]  If something's got eyes big enough to look at mine, I don't think I can end the life.
[37:13.600 --> 37:15.660]  I think a chicken is dumb enough that it's OK.
[37:15.980 --> 37:16.900]  I agree.
[37:16.960 --> 37:17.720]  Now, here's the thing.
[37:17.760 --> 37:19.420]  I also agree with you, Andrew.
[37:19.420 --> 37:23.480]  I would have a hard time doing it, but if there was an animal to do it to,
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.340]  it would be the dumbest animal, the chicken.
[37:26.020 --> 37:31.900]  It definitely feels weird being OK to eat an animal but not being OK to kill it, you know?
[37:32.060 --> 37:34.280]  I think about that sometimes, for sure.
[37:35.280 --> 37:36.000]  Because I'm in the same boat.
[37:36.080 --> 37:37.220]  I don't think I could do it, but...
[37:37.220 --> 37:39.800]  What did Werner Herzog describe with chickens?
[37:40.740 --> 37:41.280]  What's that?
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.860]  The Werner Herzog quote on chickens?
[37:43.860 --> 37:44.670]  It was like...
[37:45.780 --> 37:46.680]  Oh, here.
[37:47.060 --> 37:49.740]  Look into the eyes of a chicken, you will see real stupidity.
[37:50.080 --> 37:53.600]  It is a kind of bottomless stupidity, a fiendish stupidity.
[37:53.900 --> 37:55.360]  They're the most horrifying animal.
[37:58.640 --> 38:00.040]  I mean, he's not wrong.
[38:00.240 --> 38:00.360]  Oh, wait.
[38:00.660 --> 38:04.240]  They're the most horrifying, cannibalistic, and nightmarish creatures in the world.
[38:04.600 --> 38:06.420]  So, like, I feel fine about killing a chicken.
[38:06.480 --> 38:06.620]  Yeah.
[38:06.780 --> 38:07.300]  After reading it.
[38:07.360 --> 38:08.120]  No, I get it.
[38:08.220 --> 38:11.900]  Do you have, like, older relatives who tell you stories about, like,
[38:11.900 --> 38:14.400]  how they would have to, like, kill chickens growing up and stuff?
[38:14.500 --> 38:14.580]  No.
[38:14.580 --> 38:17.760]  Like, Gavin, is that something that you ever talked to, like, your grandparents about or anything?
[38:18.380 --> 38:18.920]  Killing chickens?
[38:19.540 --> 38:19.840]  Yeah.
[38:20.080 --> 38:22.380]  Like, was that... you never heard stories about that stuff?
[38:23.040 --> 38:23.840]  I don't think so.
[38:25.220 --> 38:27.520]  My grandma grew up in, like, the Appalachian Mountains.
[38:27.920 --> 38:31.900]  And she would tell us that when they were kids and it was time for, like, supper,
[38:32.460 --> 38:34.900]  their mom would tell them to go get a chicken.
[38:35.160 --> 38:40.240]  And they would play the game of taking the chicken by the neck
[38:40.240 --> 38:44.080]  and swinging it around to break its neck and then seeing where it ran around and landed.
[38:44.240 --> 38:46.120]  And that was the game to them.
[38:46.320 --> 38:46.920]  Oh, that's fun.
[38:47.340 --> 38:51.020]  That's what I'm saying. Like, you eventually... it normalizes.
[38:51.760 --> 38:53.800]  That's... Andrew, that's why you're totally right.
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.400]  Like, again, I just don't know, like, where that threshold is for me.
[38:57.480 --> 38:58.440]  And I don't want to find out.
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.200]  It's probably about seven chickens.
[39:02.360 --> 39:05.640]  Over under seven... seven and a half chickens over under.
[39:05.960 --> 39:09.400]  It's a solid... it's a solid week of chicken killing.
[39:09.400 --> 39:10.900]  And then suddenly it becomes a game.
[39:11.100 --> 39:12.760]  Yeah. Andrew, what are the chicken vibes?
[39:13.540 --> 39:15.980]  Chicken vibes are great. All type chicken vibes.
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.400]  I was wondering, for me, I think I've probably maintained around 100 average
[39:20.400 --> 39:22.560]  for at least the past 20 years.
[39:22.900 --> 39:24.480]  It's like 2000 chickens.
[39:25.400 --> 39:31.060]  Is there a single action character that has killed more people than I have consumed chickens?
[39:32.040 --> 39:33.080]  Oh, in a movie?
[39:33.540 --> 39:34.960]  In, like, a series of films.
[39:35.160 --> 39:38.420]  I looked up Rambo. Rambo's surprisingly low kill count.
[39:38.420 --> 39:39.920]  Rambo's, like, 400.
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.860]  80s movies had much lower kill counts than you remember.
[39:45.020 --> 39:49.180]  I mean, Terminator 2 was partially famous because it had a kill count that was, like,
[39:49.460 --> 39:51.560]  70 or something, which is nothing.
[39:52.340 --> 39:53.300]  What was Terminator 2 kill count?
[39:54.380 --> 39:58.240]  What about, um, like, Dr. Manhattan or something?
[39:58.600 --> 39:59.740]  I guess he doesn't kill everyone.
[39:59.820 --> 40:02.280]  He just gets framed as killing everyone.
[40:03.680 --> 40:04.640]  That's a lot of people.
[40:05.500 --> 40:05.780]  That is.
[40:05.800 --> 40:07.140]  A lot of people die in 300?
[40:07.760 --> 40:08.160]  Uh.
[40:09.020 --> 40:10.540]  At least 299 of them.
[40:10.740 --> 40:10.900]  Yep.
[40:11.220 --> 40:11.600]  Okay.
[40:12.820 --> 40:15.780]  Not exactly what I meant, but I mean, I appreciate it.
[40:15.780 --> 40:16.300]  Thank you.
[40:17.100 --> 40:18.680]  There's a lot of people do die in that movie.
[40:18.800 --> 40:19.600]  Yeah, thanks, man.
[40:19.760 --> 40:20.420]  No, I appreciate it.
[40:20.420 --> 40:25.260]  I wonder, like, statistically, how many people, like, Nathan Drake has killed throughout that
[40:25.260 --> 40:25.560]  series.
[40:25.700 --> 40:27.740]  Oh, way more than way more than 2000.
[40:28.140 --> 40:29.260]  Just in the first one.
[40:29.760 --> 40:31.000]  Or like Master Chief.
[40:31.080 --> 40:31.760]  How many aliens?
[40:31.820 --> 40:34.860]  If you count, like, no respawning aliens.
[40:35.560 --> 40:39.580]  Like those sections where they just keep coming unless you leave or whatever.
[40:40.400 --> 40:42.000]  Sounds like Chef Smut novel.
[40:44.080 --> 40:45.280]  Oh, did you take a peek?
[40:45.500 --> 40:46.200]  A little early read?
[40:46.780 --> 40:51.120]  No, it's just I said coming in relation to aliens and I just assumed.
[40:51.860 --> 40:53.280]  Yeah, you're pretty, you're pretty on point.
[40:54.340 --> 40:58.980]  I, uh, it's funny you say that about the chickens and how many you eat in a year.
[40:59.040 --> 41:02.800]  I was just doing the hot dog research the other day for Saul, right?
[41:03.120 --> 41:03.340]  You know?
[41:04.480 --> 41:06.920]  Because I'm definitely in my hot dog era.
[41:07.400 --> 41:11.240]  And I found a stat that I thought was fascinating that I did want to share with you guys.
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.240]  And this is a perfect time to share it.
[41:12.260 --> 41:17.400]  Do you know how many hot dogs the average American supposedly eats in a year?
[41:19.300 --> 41:20.460]  Ooh, average American.
[41:21.200 --> 41:21.500]  10.
[41:21.600 --> 41:23.860]  How many do you think you eat in a year, Gavin?
[41:24.420 --> 41:26.020]  I only eat them at baseball games.
[41:26.820 --> 41:29.560]  I eat maybe five or six a year.
[41:30.480 --> 41:31.860]  I love hot dogs.
[41:31.860 --> 41:34.540]  I think about them more than a person should think about hot dogs.
[41:34.700 --> 41:37.280]  And I don't think I eat the average.
[41:37.520 --> 41:40.560]  I don't know how it's fucking possible this is the average.
[41:40.860 --> 41:41.420]  Is it over a hundred?
[41:42.040 --> 41:42.320]  No.
[41:43.200 --> 41:51.720]  According to the internet, the Americans eat an average of 70 hot dogs per person per year.
[41:52.240 --> 41:52.980]  No fucking shot.
[41:53.280 --> 41:53.740]  No way.
[41:54.380 --> 41:55.540]  There's no way.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.920]  That's, that's insane.
[41:57.920 --> 42:02.580]  That is on the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council website.
[42:03.620 --> 42:07.740]  Could we, from this moment, it's August 1st today.
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.600]  Let's start counting from now till next August 1st how many hot dogs we eat between this time.
[42:13.620 --> 42:14.420]  We'll have a dog count?
[42:14.940 --> 42:15.480]  Dog count.
[42:15.500 --> 42:17.980]  Oh, maybe we could have like a live count on a website somewhere.
[42:18.500 --> 42:20.080]  Yeah, it will be dog count and I like that.
[42:20.420 --> 42:24.900]  Do we want to share it or is it a thing where like we come back and say like, hey, I actually...
[42:24.900 --> 42:25.780]  No, let's share it.
[42:25.960 --> 42:26.680]  No, let's share it.
[42:26.680 --> 42:32.800]  I think keeping that tally going live, people go like, oh my God, Eric ate four hot dogs.
[42:32.960 --> 42:37.100]  So when is it from? From now until...
[42:37.100 --> 42:39.360]  From now until next August 1st.
[42:39.360 --> 42:39.580]  Yeah.
[42:39.700 --> 42:41.480]  So for one year, one full year.
[42:41.540 --> 42:41.720]  One year.
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.420]  Yeah, because that's what your average was, right?
[42:43.860 --> 42:44.960]  Yeah, it's a year.
[42:46.260 --> 42:49.940]  This is what it says. According to recent survey data obtained by the council,
[42:50.120 --> 42:53.520]  Americans purchase 350 million pounds of hot dogs at retail stores.
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.100]  That's nine billion hot dogs.
[42:55.140 --> 42:59.160]  But the actual number of hot dogs consumed by Americans is much larger.
[42:59.200 --> 43:01.040]  It's difficult to calculate the number of hot dogs
[43:02.660 --> 43:06.120]  Americans eat at sporting events, picnics and carnivals, but they estimate
[43:06.120 --> 43:08.600]  Americans consume 20 billion dogs a year.
[43:09.200 --> 43:12.540]  That works out to about 70 hot dogs per person per year.
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.480]  Hot dogs are served in 95% of homes in the United States.
[43:16.980 --> 43:21.680]  15% of hot dogs are purchased from street vendors and 9% are purchased at ballparks.
[43:22.320 --> 43:27.120]  Do you think if if humanity took all the dogs that had ever been produced or eaten
[43:28.260 --> 43:32.280]  and put them in orbit, would we be able to see it like a moon?
[43:34.620 --> 43:36.460]  Yes, you could make a moon dog.
[43:36.700 --> 43:38.280]  That's a lot of dogs.
[43:39.060 --> 43:42.160]  I mean, it's 20 billion a year and that's in America.
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.460]  I don't even think we're the number one nation.
[43:46.000 --> 43:47.940]  What country eats the most hot dogs?
[43:48.060 --> 43:49.800]  I know the answer. I just want to make sure I'm right.
[43:49.800 --> 43:52.120]  How much does the moon weigh?
[43:52.120 --> 43:53.700]  Because I don't think I don't think you're going to guess it.
[43:53.820 --> 43:54.760]  I don't think you're going to guess it.
[43:56.240 --> 43:58.220]  I'd say at least 5,000 dogs.
[43:59.740 --> 44:00.400]  Moon weight.
[44:01.760 --> 44:03.740]  How many? Wait, how many people?
[44:03.960 --> 44:05.160]  You think that the moon?
[44:05.460 --> 44:08.780]  You think the moon is probably less than 5,000 pounds?
[44:09.980 --> 44:11.260]  Well, how much does a dog weigh?
[44:12.040 --> 44:12.420]  Hot dog.
[44:12.980 --> 44:14.620]  It's less than a pound, right? Half a pound.
[44:15.040 --> 44:15.960]  What do you mean right?
[44:16.280 --> 44:19.360]  Why are you saying right like you think it's more than a pound?
[44:19.800 --> 44:21.360]  Do you think a hot dog is more than a pound?
[44:21.980 --> 44:23.900]  Smokies can be pretty heavy. Do they count?
[44:25.420 --> 44:27.120]  Are we including smokies?
[44:27.220 --> 44:28.280]  Is a dog? How does it weigh?
[44:30.500 --> 44:33.240]  Thousand million billion trillion quadrillion.
[44:33.640 --> 44:35.320]  The moon weighs...
[44:38.460 --> 44:42.920]  Okay, you, Eric, can someone look up how much a dog weighs?
[44:43.640 --> 44:45.260]  You're saying hot dog, yes.
[44:45.380 --> 44:46.660]  Yeah, how much does a hot dog weigh?
[44:47.440 --> 44:48.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:48.440 --> 44:48.740]  Okay.
[44:48.740 --> 44:53.040]  Tell me how much it weighs and then don't say how much the moon weighs.
[44:53.380 --> 44:55.920]  Okay. Are you ready?
[44:56.940 --> 44:59.820]  Give me the number of the weight of a hot dog and I'll tell you moon.
[44:59.920 --> 45:00.200]  Okay.
[45:01.940 --> 45:04.540]  A standard hot dog weighs 1.6 ounces.
[45:05.540 --> 45:08.260]  What? I need that in... how many ounces?
[45:08.260 --> 45:10.080]  Don't look at me! You asked me for this!
[45:10.480 --> 45:11.520]  Okay, how many ounces?
[45:12.820 --> 45:14.220]  How many ounces in a pound?
[45:15.300 --> 45:16.420]  Ounces in a pound?
[45:16.420 --> 45:18.860]  There are 40 hot dogs in five pounds.
[45:19.820 --> 45:21.040]  40 hot dogs.
[45:22.060 --> 45:24.660]  Okay, no, it's fine. We'll listen. He gets my brain.
[45:26.160 --> 45:26.920]  40 hot dogs in five pounds.
[45:26.920 --> 45:28.520]  I'm giving him round numbers to play with.
[45:29.520 --> 45:32.180]  So it's like 12 and a half hot dogs a pound? Is that right?
[45:32.860 --> 45:36.000]  Oh, man. Okay, 40 hot dogs, five pounds.
[45:36.400 --> 45:37.460]  We're a long way off the moon.
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.640]  Well, his first and his initial guess was 5,000.
[45:42.660 --> 45:43.200]  I'm gonna say...
[45:43.800 --> 45:44.540]  So we've been way off.
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.260]  I'm gonna say a number you tell me over under.
[45:49.460 --> 45:49.980]  Okay?
[45:50.320 --> 45:50.840]  5,000.
[45:53.220 --> 45:53.740]  Four...
[45:53.740 --> 45:56.440]  Oh, wait, I didn't have to do the math. Fuck.
[45:56.780 --> 45:57.340]  So 40...
[45:58.720 --> 46:01.040]  How much does four million hot dogs weigh?
[46:04.860 --> 46:05.800]  In pounds.
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.700]  So 40... 40 is five...
[46:09.260 --> 46:11.100]  40 is five pounds.
[46:11.980 --> 46:12.140]  What?
[46:12.500 --> 46:14.400]  This is what Chicago should have sang about.
[46:19.240 --> 46:21.400]  This show is good. This is a good show.
[46:21.480 --> 46:23.360]  I've got moon stats. I've got the moon weight here.
[46:23.620 --> 46:25.680]  Yeah, don't tell me. Don't tell me. I'm gonna get there.
[46:25.820 --> 46:26.940]  I'm gonna get there via dogs.
[46:27.520 --> 46:29.220]  You're not gonna get anywhere near it with dogs.
[46:29.860 --> 46:32.320]  No, how many times does 40...
[46:33.020 --> 46:34.840]  How many times does five go into a million?
[46:40.400 --> 46:41.760]  Wait, how many times...
[46:44.400 --> 46:46.300]  Two million divided by 40.
[46:46.940 --> 46:47.620]  In a million.
[46:47.940 --> 46:49.440]  Yeah, let him get there. Let him get there, Gavin.
[46:49.880 --> 46:50.700]  Five go to a million.
[46:52.280 --> 46:53.360]  Did you guys...
[46:53.360 --> 46:53.760]  How many times...
[46:53.760 --> 46:59.200]  While he's doing that, did you guys know that Americans consume an average of 818 hot dogs per
[46:59.200 --> 46:59.560]  second?
[47:00.940 --> 47:03.860]  That's crazy. So think about all the time you wanted to wipe out.
[47:04.180 --> 47:06.920]  In 90 minutes that you wanted to wipe out, that's so many dogs, dude.
[47:07.420 --> 47:09.680]  I would have wiped out a lot of dogs. That's true.
[47:10.000 --> 47:10.820]  That's given to us.
[47:10.860 --> 47:13.900]  And you can figure out how many while Andrew figures out how many hot dogs...
[47:13.900 --> 47:17.080]  So if you have 200,000 five-dollar bills, you have a million dollars.
[47:17.080 --> 47:20.840]  I can do it. I can do it. Hold on. 818...
[47:20.840 --> 47:21.700]  Wait, what did you say, Andrew?
[47:22.420 --> 47:27.500]  If you have $200,000 in five-dollar bills...
[47:28.280 --> 47:28.680]  Dollars?
[47:29.220 --> 47:31.860]  What is going on?
[47:31.860 --> 47:33.680]  Calm down. Let me explain.
[47:34.140 --> 47:38.320]  If you have 200,000 in five-dollar bills, you have a million dollars.
[47:38.560 --> 47:39.040]  60 minutes.
[47:39.240 --> 47:40.800]  So it's 200 million...
[47:40.800 --> 47:42.500]  Or no, it's 200,000 units.
[47:43.660 --> 47:50.180]  So 200,000 units of hot dogs is a million...
[47:52.040 --> 47:58.200]  Wait, I need a sheet from me. I need some paper.
[47:58.660 --> 48:00.760]  I'm getting lost in the numbers.
[48:01.520 --> 48:04.620]  I want this to be in the next science fiction movie.
[48:04.780 --> 48:07.620]  Imagine the background of Interstellar and one of the chalkboards is just...
[48:08.300 --> 48:10.080]  The ramblings of this mentalist.
[48:10.220 --> 48:11.800]  Just dog math in the background.
[48:11.800 --> 48:14.300]  So 40 dogs is five.
[48:15.220 --> 48:16.360]  40 dogs is five, yeah.
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.300]  I said a million dogs. I was trying to figure out how much a million dogs weighs.
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.520]  So a million dogs at five would be 200,000 to get to a million.
[48:27.780 --> 48:28.760]  So 200,000...
[48:28.760 --> 48:30.140]  Oh, no, wait. That doesn't...
[48:30.140 --> 48:30.380]  Wait.
[48:31.760 --> 48:33.680]  You're saying you want to do 40 times 200,000?
[48:34.240 --> 48:35.960]  I don't know what I want to do, Gavin.
[48:36.560 --> 48:37.960]  So the moon weighs...
[48:38.840 --> 48:41.140]  Wait, wait a second.
[48:41.320 --> 48:42.460]  I'm going to take my headphones off.
[48:42.460 --> 48:43.600]  How close are you to an answer?
[48:44.440 --> 48:45.240]  Nowhere close.
[48:45.740 --> 48:46.480]  Nowhere close.
[48:46.720 --> 48:48.740]  But I'm going to need more time than the show allows.
[48:48.980 --> 48:51.920]  I would have wiped out approximately two million hot dogs.
[48:52.200 --> 48:54.140]  I don't feel comfortable doing that.
[48:54.320 --> 48:59.340]  And so I rescind the entirety of the intent of my statement.
[48:59.700 --> 49:02.740]  I don't want to eliminate two million hot dogs from the population.
[49:02.960 --> 49:03.540]  That seems cruel.
[49:05.140 --> 49:07.240]  I'm ordering hot dogs for lunch now
[49:07.240 --> 49:08.840]  You better write it down.
[49:10.160 --> 49:11.500]  Make sure to take a note of it.
[49:11.700 --> 49:12.340]  I will.
[49:13.120 --> 49:15.840]  My next hot dog is probably in Detroit at a baseball game.
[49:16.800 --> 49:17.680]  Oh, yeah.
[49:18.320 --> 49:19.660]  I might have a chili dog for lunch.
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.120]  You're having a chili dog for lunch? That's dangerous.
[49:22.140 --> 49:23.200]  I mean, we've been talking about...
[49:23.200 --> 49:26.500]  How many dogs did you demolish during your desk dog era?
[49:27.420 --> 49:29.380]  I only made desk dogs once.
[49:33.820 --> 49:34.600]  Oh, man.
[49:34.600 --> 49:37.940]  Well, we got a lot of content out of the one time you made hot dogs.
[49:38.180 --> 49:40.620]  I made desk dogs once and it occurred...
[49:40.620 --> 49:43.940]  It was simultaneous with Trump upsetting the election.
[49:44.120 --> 49:45.060]  It was a wild day.
[49:45.420 --> 49:46.280]  It was a wild night.
[49:47.180 --> 49:48.720]  That was all the same day.
[49:49.420 --> 49:54.780]  Me running around my room trying to throw pancake mix around because I think the fire department's coming.
[49:59.970 --> 50:00.990]  I guess I made...
[50:00.990 --> 50:02.470]  No, I did it twice because I did...
[50:02.470 --> 50:04.290]  I did closet dogs once as well.
[50:04.830 --> 50:07.030]  So, what figure did you come to?
[50:07.550 --> 50:08.370]  Yeah, so where'd you land?
[50:09.850 --> 50:12.570]  The figure I landed is where I'm getting hot dogs from.
[50:14.170 --> 50:14.970]  Let's say...
[50:17.210 --> 50:21.450]  The problem is, if I just say the weight, do you know the number of dogs?
[50:22.030 --> 50:23.410]  Is that math that you can do?
[50:25.410 --> 50:26.230]  Well, based on your...
[50:26.230 --> 50:27.230]  No, this is your thing.
[50:27.810 --> 50:30.190]  I mean, a hot dog is 1.2 ounces, right?
[50:30.250 --> 50:30.830]  Isn't that what Eric said?
[50:30.910 --> 50:32.390]  I think it was 1.6.
[50:32.390 --> 50:34.750]  Oh, 40 dogs is 5 pounds.
[50:35.670 --> 50:36.630]  It's true, 1.6 ounces.
[50:36.950 --> 50:38.730]  So, 80 dogs is 10 pounds.
[50:39.510 --> 50:40.390]  80 dogs is 10 pounds.
[50:40.730 --> 50:41.570]  20 is 15.
[50:42.590 --> 50:43.570]  We're gonna get there.
[50:43.770 --> 50:44.210]  160.
[50:44.670 --> 50:48.610]  We're gonna add 40s until we get to how much the moon weighs.
[50:51.950 --> 50:53.870]  This is... we're gonna table this.
[50:53.970 --> 50:58.490]  This is gonna be a supplemental in itself, so we don't have to subject people to...
[50:58.490 --> 51:01.730]  I like the idea of there being like a times tables, but for dog weight.
[51:01.730 --> 51:05.330]  I need one of those things with the beads that go back and forth.
[51:05.990 --> 51:07.390]  Yeah, one of those.
[51:08.670 --> 51:09.890]  How embarrassing was it, Gavin?
[51:09.950 --> 51:13.230]  I got to call you a doofus because you said something dumb.
[51:14.050 --> 51:14.870]  That must have been tough.
[51:15.010 --> 51:16.490]  I mean, I said at the time it was shocking.
[51:16.670 --> 51:20.410]  It was the most venomous doofus I've ever received in my life.
[51:20.410 --> 51:22.210]  Well, you know why I was so quick on the draw?
[51:22.750 --> 51:23.810]  I didn't share this with you.
[51:24.230 --> 51:26.750]  I had the same thought about 15 minutes earlier.
[51:27.090 --> 51:29.270]  And I went through the exercise in my head.
[51:29.590 --> 51:31.010]  That's why I was quick on the draw.
[51:31.010 --> 51:32.490]  Because I had that thought.
[51:32.930 --> 51:34.390]  And then I realized, oh, it's face down.
[51:34.510 --> 51:37.930]  So then when you came at me with it, I was like, oh, no, I'm ready.
[51:38.150 --> 51:39.070]  I'm ready for this.
[51:39.770 --> 51:43.530]  Yeah, I didn't take into account that the column header was taking up the first slot.
[51:46.550 --> 51:48.570]  I've been loving the Olympics.
[51:49.210 --> 51:51.970]  I got real nervous because I took the under on Kazakhstan.
[51:53.370 --> 51:55.850]  And it's two and they need two to hit the over.
[51:56.310 --> 51:59.250]  And they got one on the first evening of the Olympics.
[51:59.250 --> 52:02.410]  Wow, they haven't done anything since.
[52:02.530 --> 52:06.870]  I've been checking every day anxiously, making sure that Kazakhstan doesn't get another gold.
[52:07.350 --> 52:09.250]  So I'm I'm confused.
[52:09.610 --> 52:12.990]  Are we vamping while he does math or did we give up?
[52:13.170 --> 52:14.530]  No, no, there's no.
[52:14.890 --> 52:16.130]  I think he gave up on it.
[52:16.450 --> 52:18.830]  Are we ever going to find out how much the moon weighs then?
[52:19.170 --> 52:24.210]  The moon weighs 74 million, million, million tons or in pounds.
[52:24.530 --> 52:27.850]  It's a one followed by 23 zeros.
[52:29.250 --> 52:33.210]  So Andrew was close when he said 1.6 ounces.
[52:33.910 --> 52:35.150]  5,000 hot dogs.
[52:35.150 --> 52:39.090]  So I assume if you were able to stick all the dogs ever consumed by humans
[52:39.090 --> 52:43.130]  in a big ball by the moon, it would appear very tiny.
[52:43.470 --> 52:46.650]  Maybe the size of like a star through a telescope.
[52:48.190 --> 52:48.650]  You think?
[52:51.330 --> 52:57.510]  Let me say 20 billion hot dogs a year just in the US.
[52:58.050 --> 52:59.070]  That's the whole world.
[52:59.950 --> 53:01.610]  You took your headphones off.
[53:01.830 --> 53:02.930]  I didn't want to have the moon weight.
[53:03.190 --> 53:03.290]  Spoiler.
[53:03.370 --> 53:04.290]  Oh my God.
[53:05.370 --> 53:06.370]  Some people want to keep that.
[53:06.630 --> 53:08.570]  Should we put a spoiler warning at the beginning of the episode?
[53:08.690 --> 53:09.210]  Say we do.
[53:09.350 --> 53:09.750]  Spoilers!
[53:10.110 --> 53:11.370]  Spoil the weight of the moon.
[53:11.670 --> 53:15.190]  We will tell you how big the moon is in this episode.
[53:17.510 --> 53:18.290]  Next episode.
[53:18.450 --> 53:19.130]  I'm going to listen.
[53:19.370 --> 53:20.070]  I'm going to go offline.
[53:20.070 --> 53:21.590]  I'm going to put that at the front in the description.
[53:22.770 --> 53:23.170]  Warning.
[53:25.950 --> 53:26.350]  Spoilers.
[53:26.990 --> 53:28.170]  I'm going to do some math.
[53:28.170 --> 53:28.910]  Fuck you.
[53:30.070 --> 53:34.270]  And next episode, I'm going to throw a number and you guys can tell me over or under that number.
[53:34.790 --> 53:36.890]  And we'll narrow it in.
[53:37.490 --> 53:39.570]  Can I make my prediction now?
[53:40.170 --> 53:40.430]  Yeah.
[53:40.910 --> 53:41.390]  Under.
[53:41.990 --> 53:44.830]  I'm going to go really high.
[53:45.170 --> 53:46.130]  I still predict under.
[53:46.350 --> 53:49.350]  I don't understand the number Gavin said.
[53:50.790 --> 53:52.750]  It didn't sound like math anymore.
[53:53.450 --> 53:55.230]  I play clicker games, okay?
[53:55.230 --> 53:56.170]  I know some big numbers.
[53:57.030 --> 53:59.110]  You get big real fast in those clicker games.
[54:00.370 --> 54:02.370]  I start getting symbols you don't even know.
[54:04.350 --> 54:05.010]  What's a UT?
[54:05.210 --> 54:06.190]  I have no fucking idea.
[54:06.390 --> 54:07.290]  That's when I stop.
[54:07.590 --> 54:12.670]  When I get to the UT in a clicker game, I stop because I just can't comprehend what I'm looking at.
[54:14.410 --> 54:15.610]  I don't know. Millions to a billion.
[54:16.010 --> 54:17.970]  You know, in a clicker, you've never played a clicker?
[54:18.590 --> 54:18.650]  No.
[54:19.670 --> 54:20.110]  What are you on about?
[54:20.950 --> 54:23.090]  Am I the only one here that's played clicker games?
[54:23.670 --> 54:24.830]  I mean, I've played the last of us.
[54:24.830 --> 54:26.250]  Like cookie clicker?
[54:26.410 --> 54:28.570]  Yeah, like cookie clicker. That's an example.
[54:29.030 --> 54:30.170]  Cookie clicker?
[54:30.370 --> 54:30.710]  Yeah.
[54:34.930 --> 54:37.010]  Gavin says it so different.
[54:37.790 --> 54:41.650]  Everyone's just letting me be confused for like 30 straight seconds here.
[54:41.650 --> 54:42.410]  No one said anything.
[54:42.670 --> 54:47.350]  He said cookie clicker like he'd never heard those words together in his life.
[54:50.030 --> 54:53.490]  Am I the idiot after all this? I'm the moron?
[54:53.610 --> 54:54.730]  No, no, no. I don't think you are.
[54:54.830 --> 54:57.350]  I just assumed that one of you would have played.
[54:57.850 --> 54:58.670]  It's an idle game.
[54:59.390 --> 55:00.470]  You'd probably hate it.
[55:00.590 --> 55:02.110]  You don't strike me as an idle game guy.
[55:02.250 --> 55:04.430]  Where you're just trying to make the numbers get bigger.
[55:04.590 --> 55:06.210]  And the game is constantly running.
[55:06.470 --> 55:10.710]  And then you pop into it for five minutes and you buy upgrades and you make the numbers go larger.
[55:11.430 --> 55:11.970]  So what's UT?
[55:12.750 --> 55:13.630]  I don't know.
[55:14.070 --> 55:15.510]  I'd said the currency number.
[55:16.470 --> 55:18.630]  Like it'll go from millions to billions to trillions.
[55:18.810 --> 55:21.330]  And then eventually you just because the numbers just keep going up.
[55:21.570 --> 55:24.210]  You hit currency levels that I have no clue.
[55:24.210 --> 55:27.910]  I think a UT is 0.7 moons.
[55:29.310 --> 55:31.730]  Oh, I think it's yeah.
[55:31.750 --> 55:32.250]  Over under.
[55:33.810 --> 55:35.330]  That's an under for me.
[55:35.750 --> 55:37.830]  I'm excited to hear your moon guess next week though.
[55:37.970 --> 55:39.810]  I think that's going to be... we should remember to do that.
[55:39.830 --> 55:40.510]  I need to sit.
[55:40.910 --> 55:41.730]  Lab work.
[55:42.150 --> 55:43.250]  Oh, I'm noting it.
[55:43.430 --> 55:46.010]  I'm putting it in caps.
[55:46.110 --> 55:46.550]  Moon guess.
[55:47.570 --> 55:49.350]  Hopefully you remember what moon guess means.
[55:49.530 --> 55:50.310]  I got the note though.
[55:50.790 --> 55:52.370]  I got to put my moon shoes on.
[55:52.470 --> 55:53.810]  I got to get into the mind of a moon.
[55:53.810 --> 55:55.550]  I got to really try to feel the way.
[55:57.570 --> 56:04.390]  I read a great comment this week about how someone said they wanted to subscribe to our
[56:04.390 --> 56:07.330]  Patreon, but make sure that Eric doesn't get his cut.
[56:09.730 --> 56:15.630]  I feel like we should definitely do a tier on Patreon that is $25 discounted to 20.
[56:16.710 --> 56:18.630]  For exactly that purpose.
[56:19.130 --> 56:20.230]  Doesn't go to Eric.
[56:20.530 --> 56:22.730]  We just make sure Eric never gets that cut.
[56:22.730 --> 56:27.410]  It's because I made fun of that guy that said like he said that Andrew sounds like he just
[56:27.410 --> 56:27.850]  made a post.
[56:28.150 --> 56:30.310]  Is it just me or does Andrew sound like Bernie Burns?
[56:30.450 --> 56:32.370]  And it's like you're fucking crazy.
[56:32.730 --> 56:34.950]  You're a crazy... get your ears checked.
[56:35.230 --> 56:39.430]  It's a community of people who need to get their ears and eyes checked now.
[56:39.990 --> 56:41.310]  Like what is happening?
[56:41.410 --> 56:42.670]  Their senses are dulled.
[56:42.750 --> 56:44.030]  They need to figure something out.
[56:44.190 --> 56:44.710]  It's not working.
[56:44.990 --> 56:47.230]  Big words coming from a guy that didn't like twisters.
[56:47.890 --> 56:48.690]  Big words.
[56:49.770 --> 56:52.710]  Sounds like you need to get your ears and eyes checked based on what they're saying.
[56:52.730 --> 56:53.730]  Great movie.
[56:54.010 --> 56:55.310]  Yeah, that's what needs to happen.
[56:55.430 --> 56:57.330]  How did twisters sound to you?
[56:59.490 --> 57:01.190]  It sounded like Nick.
[57:01.410 --> 57:01.850]  What?
[57:03.190 --> 57:04.130]  That's not true.
[57:05.290 --> 57:05.730]  No.
[57:07.730 --> 57:08.490]  I got confused.
[57:08.530 --> 57:10.490]  I closed my eyes and I thought Nick was talking to me.
[57:10.590 --> 57:11.750]  And it was just twisters.
[57:13.590 --> 57:16.090]  I've often get Nick and a tornado confused.
[57:17.210 --> 57:19.130]  I can never... if I'm hearing them...
[57:19.130 --> 57:21.310]  It's why I don't listen to old episodes because I can't tell.
[57:21.310 --> 57:23.190]  Is that Nick or is it the fucking tornado again?
[57:23.990 --> 57:25.650]  They did try in that movie.
[57:25.710 --> 57:26.690]  They did try to implement...
[57:26.690 --> 57:27.810]  This is another reason I didn't like the movie.
[57:27.930 --> 57:30.690]  They tried to implement a new sound to the twisters that was like...
[57:31.950 --> 57:33.370]  Like if something was spinning.
[57:33.530 --> 57:35.030]  But it's all... that's not like...
[57:36.030 --> 57:37.090]  It's all spinning.
[57:37.530 --> 57:37.890]  What?
[57:38.510 --> 57:39.850]  What bit is making that noise?
[57:40.110 --> 57:40.630]  It's not like a revolution coming back at you.
[57:40.650 --> 57:41.690]  It's not like a fan.
[57:41.890 --> 57:42.510]  It's not like a...
[57:43.790 --> 57:46.430]  How would there be one part of it that's coming around?
[57:46.890 --> 57:49.230]  Is that like the sound of a house that's trapped inside it?
[57:49.350 --> 57:49.930]  What was the...
[57:50.930 --> 57:54.230]  That's the... yeah, that's the house from Wizard of Oz spinning around.
[57:54.490 --> 57:57.610]  I think historically a twister just sounds like a constant...
[57:58.690 --> 58:00.910]  Terrifying whistle of air and wind.
[58:03.070 --> 58:04.650]  I just... we already...
[58:05.490 --> 58:07.490]  I need to watch it again and see if I was too harsh.
[58:08.070 --> 58:12.170]  The idea that a guy would spend five years in the army and walk away with billions of dollars
[58:12.170 --> 58:17.790]  in missile satellite technology that while he was in the army was the size of a block,
[58:17.790 --> 58:20.850]  but they got it down to the size of an LED panel.
[58:21.150 --> 58:23.450]  And then the military let him take it.
[58:23.550 --> 58:26.930]  Once again, just pointing out, I was in the army also for five years.
[58:27.030 --> 58:30.730]  I got a blanket and a pair of boots and my dog tags when I left.
[58:30.870 --> 58:32.390]  And I had to fight for the blanket.
[58:32.890 --> 58:35.990]  You know, it's like, I just... it boggles the mind.
[58:36.150 --> 58:39.050]  And then the idea that it's funded by an evil developer
[58:39.050 --> 58:43.670]  who just wants to buy up property cheaply after people go through a tragedy.
[58:43.670 --> 58:48.650]  They need to hire a company with billions of dollars of technology to figure out
[58:48.650 --> 58:51.830]  the place that used to be a house is going to be for sale next week.
[58:52.730 --> 58:57.210]  Buy... hire 30 real estate agents and let them loose on those Oklahoma towns
[58:57.210 --> 59:00.870]  and save 60 billion dollars in R&D investment.
[59:01.150 --> 59:02.070]  It's so ludicrous.
[59:02.150 --> 59:03.830]  I'm sorry. Here we go. Here we go again.
[59:04.410 --> 59:08.150]  I'm sorry the spinning cow in the wind movie wasn't more realistic for you.
[59:08.270 --> 59:09.130]  I apologize.
[59:09.230 --> 59:10.670]  I wish that there was a spinning cow.
[59:10.670 --> 59:12.850]  I wish to God there was a spinning cow.
[59:12.850 --> 59:15.610]  Andrew, you're talking about stuff that didn't happen in the movie.
[59:15.950 --> 59:17.690]  Yeah. Is there a reference?
[59:18.210 --> 59:20.550]  You spin a cow in the movie. I'll see it again.
[59:21.050 --> 59:21.830]  Yep. I wish.
[59:22.170 --> 59:25.710]  I mean, we're not saying like the first movie was sensible.
[59:25.910 --> 59:27.050]  It was a goofy movie.
[59:27.390 --> 59:32.650]  At some point, they drive through a house that blew in the road and like go through the woods.
[59:33.130 --> 59:34.270]  It's a stupid movie.
[59:34.550 --> 59:37.710]  I think my main problem with this one is that it took itself really seriously.
[59:38.390 --> 59:40.350]  Yeah. There's no memorable action sequences.
[59:40.550 --> 59:41.930]  Yeah. There's no memorable action sequences.
[59:41.930 --> 59:43.890]  Nothing is happening.
[59:44.170 --> 59:48.230]  Well, I hear it's great and you should go see it for yourself and make your own opinions.
[59:48.590 --> 59:50.970]  I also think people should see it.
[59:51.250 --> 59:56.350]  I think people, irrespective of our dumb movie thing, people should see every movie in the
[59:56.350 --> 01:00:00.010]  theater because if they don't, there won't be any more movies in theaters and going to
[01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:00.850]  the movies is fun.
[01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.310]  So go see Twisters 30 fucking times.
[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:07.230]  I'm not going to win this stupid competition anyway, so I don't give a fuck what movie you
[01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:10.870]  see. Just see it a lot so that there's still movies, even if they're bad.
[01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:12.270]  I think you can skip Twisters.
[01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:15.350]  I'm going to watch it again on a plane and see if maybe I was too harsh.
[01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.190]  I just remember I was a little bit disappointed with it.
[01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:18.350]  Big time plane movie.
[01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:19.190]  Yeah.
[01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:20.170]  Big time plane movie.
[01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:21.610]  I would say it's a plane movie.
[01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:22.830]  I would watch it again on a plane, probably.
[01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:24.630]  I think that what's his name?
[01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.070]  Glenn Powell.
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:26.610]  Was that his name?
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.850]  Yeah.
[01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:27.370]  Yeah.
[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:31.390]  Like he he's charming enough in his role.
[01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:35.570]  I feel like the first 10 minutes is a little wonky, but after that, like he's like they
[01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.470]  settle into that character.
[01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:41.830]  I mean, he's entertaining enough to watch, I think, but on a plane.
[01:00:42.090 --> 01:00:42.750]  Could have used a dog.
[01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.290]  Oh, dude, that dude and a dog for fucking get about it.
[01:00:46.350 --> 01:00:46.490]  Right.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:47.710]  That's another thing I'm telling you.
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.630]  We talked about it already.
[01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.250]  That's a $50 million dog.
[01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:52.730]  That's a $50 million dog.
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.550]  You put a fucking bandana around it.
[01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.150]  You got a $60 million dog.
[01:00:57.290 --> 01:00:59.770]  You figure out a way to put goggles on that dog.
[01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:02.190]  You got a $65 million dog.
[01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:03.090]  Yep.
[01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:09.390]  You figure out a way to have that dog go into the tornado and come out alive, saving something,
[01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.710]  piece of equipment, human life, whatever.
[01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.210]  $120 million dog.
[01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:14.170]  Yep.
[01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:18.670]  Well, thanks for listening to this episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.430]  Next week, Andrew's going to let us know how many hot dogs is the moon.
[01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:27.250]  You can go to Regulatrion.com and subscribe to the Patreon.
[01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.730]  You can check out our gaming channel.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.630]  You can watch us stream Fridays at 4 p.m.
[01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.150]  A lot's going on.
[01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:35.250]  Very exciting stuff.
[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:38.830]  Yeah, check out our Olympics coverage, as Andrew called it.
[01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:43.370]  It was probably the most culturally insensitive piece of content we've made today.
[01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:47.330]  I gotta say, I think somebody else said this, and I fully agree.
[01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:50.410]  It's the most Andrew I've ever seen Andrew be.
[01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:52.150]  And that is a tremendous compliment.
[01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:57.430]  You were so unbelievably entertaining in that piece of content we made.
[01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.470]  I take the Olympics seriously.
[01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.830]  Clearly.
[01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:02.870]  Clearly.
[01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:10.310]  You definitely take vibes seriously, and that definitely shines and shows through in the video.
[01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:13.090]  I keep saying video.
[01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:13.850]  I guess it's video.
[01:02:18.310 --> 01:02:19.670]  Don't drink the strawberry drink.
[01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:22.090]  You had some?
[01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.330]  I just had a little taste.
[01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.870]  You're a maniac.
[01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:26.010]  You can't.
[01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.030]  Was it good?
[01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:27.790]  I didn't get a pour.
[01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:28.370]  No.
[01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:29.290]  Why?
[01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:29.790]  What did it taste like?
[01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:30.530]  Of course it wasn't good.
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:32.910]  No, I'm not joking.
[01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:34.030]  Fucking animal, Nick.
[01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:35.710]  I definitely wouldn't have done that.
[01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:40.130]  Very sweet, but like stale.
[01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:41.470]  Stale sweet.
[01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:45.390]  I just had the tiniest little taste because I'm going to go pour this out.
[01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.990]  Why did you taste it?
[01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:49.070]  Because you guys kept telling me to taste it.
[01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:50.510]  Yeah, and it's true.
[01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:51.430]  We all did that.
[01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:52.530]  Yeah, we all did that.
[01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:52.990]  You're right.
[01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.810]  You're right.
[01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:55.690]  An entire video ago?
[01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:58.590]  Yeah, well, yeah, it was a week ago for everyone else.
[01:02:58.690 --> 01:02:59.510]  For us, it was about an hour.
[01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:02.070]  You don't get to attack me when you call it a video.
[01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:06.670]  Well, thanks for watching this video.
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:08.170]  We'll see you guys next time.
[01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.670]  Bye.
[01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.330]  It's on YouTube.
[01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:12.390]  It's got video.
[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:13.470]  He's right.
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:17.510]  I feel like I have a brain virus.
[01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:22.590]  We also feel like you have a brain virus.
[01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:25.270]  Check in and see how its vibes are.
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:30.790]  See if it knows how many hot dogs the moon weighs.
[01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:32.610]  I need more fingers.
[01:03:33.590 --> 01:03:35.430]  How is it possible to eat?
[01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:36.670]  I love hot dogs.
[01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:38.330]  I don't think I could eat 70 hot dogs in a year.
[01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:39.110]  No, no.
[01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:40.150]  It's insanity.
[01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:41.710]  That's got to be bullshit, right?
[01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:42.990]  They're juicing the figures.
[01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:44.530]  They're plumping up those figures.
[01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:47.110]  I mean, that's certainly like slightly more than one a week.
[01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.270]  They're sizzling the stats.
[01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:49.990]  Plump and juicy like a hot dog.
[01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:53.230]  It's like one every six days or so, probably.
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.430]  Can you make a healthy dog?
[01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:58.090]  Can you make like a dog that's just a cut of meat?
[01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:00.450]  What?
[01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:01.850]  What?
[01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:03.470]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:05.250]  Well, like they're terrible.
[01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.510]  They're awful for you, right?
[01:04:06.590 --> 01:04:09.370]  Because they're just like mulched up awful and shit.
[01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:10.730]  Yeah, but let's not talk about that.
[01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:11.890]  We don't want to talk about what's in them.
[01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.930]  We just want to talk about how they taste and how they make us feel.
[01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:15.550]  Yeah, and how many is the moon.
[01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:17.630]  So it's a lot of really good stuff.
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.110]  All right, guys.
[01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:18.910]  We'll talk to you later.
[01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:19.510]  Bye.
[01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:20.250]  Bye.
[01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:21.890]  Oh, no.
[01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:24.210]  Oh, no.
[01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.950]  What?
[01:04:28.310 --> 01:04:31.750]  One of our editors texted me that the FIFA video is done.
[01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:33.890]  And I replied, thank you.
[01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.710]  Gavin, no notes and hit man.
[01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:38.570]  So feel free to juice what I meant to write in voice.
[01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:45.250]  Feel free to juice.
[01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:46.210]  Juice.
[01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:49.090]  Hey, we'll juice you later.
[01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:52.410]  See you next juice.
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.070]  Juice out.
