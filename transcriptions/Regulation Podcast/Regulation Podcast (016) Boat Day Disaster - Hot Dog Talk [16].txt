[00:00.000 --> 00:04.940]  Hello and welcome to another regulation podcast. This is episode 16. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:05.040 --> 00:09.400]  With me as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour. Hello.
[00:09.860 --> 00:12.320]  Hello. I heard that there was a boat.
[00:13.740 --> 00:16.500]  There was a boat day. What happened on the boat?
[00:16.960 --> 00:19.500]  You want to get straight into the boat? Well, we can.
[00:20.860 --> 00:24.640]  You remember the old curse of when Geoff and Gavin would hang out, it would rain?
[00:25.220 --> 00:26.880]  Of course. Classic.
[00:27.360 --> 00:28.840]  May have made an appearance again.
[00:30.140 --> 00:32.300]  I've got... I've got footage.
[00:32.960 --> 00:33.880]  Oh, really?
[00:36.020 --> 00:37.760]  Yeah. Do you want to see the footage?
[00:38.300 --> 00:38.800]  Please!
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.000]  Firstly, I should say that last year's boat day in August looked like this.
[00:43.780 --> 00:46.580]  And this year's looked pretty similar at the beginning.
[00:47.500 --> 00:50.340]  But towards the end... let me go live.
[00:51.300 --> 00:53.560]  Gavin is live. Okay, we got a video.
[00:54.200 --> 00:55.400]  Yeah, looks like you're at a pier.
[00:56.580 --> 00:56.820]  Okay.
[00:57.000 --> 00:58.340]  There's a boat.
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.500]  Yeah, this is getting... this is after we got off the boat.
[01:01.700 --> 01:02.140]  Okay.
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.280]  Jesus Christ.
[01:05.780 --> 01:07.260]  Okay, it's raining heavily.
[01:16.470 --> 01:18.030]  It's, uh... I'm trying to do commentary.
[01:18.170 --> 01:19.230]  Not a lot happening. It's raining.
[01:20.130 --> 01:21.010]  It is raining.
[01:24.170 --> 01:25.690]  There's a lot happening right now.
[01:25.990 --> 01:27.230]  The bridge is out.
[01:28.990 --> 01:29.430]  So...
[01:29.430 --> 01:30.350]  Don't worry!
[01:30.690 --> 01:32.730]  They're gonna fix the bridge, Andrew!
[01:33.990 --> 01:38.390]  What you're seeing is you're seeing a guy with the nipple rings and a backhoe
[01:38.390 --> 01:42.230]  trying to reconnect the dock that got disconnected in a storm.
[01:50.010 --> 01:51.270]  They tried to...
[01:51.270 --> 01:53.770]  Now, look at this here. Doesn't this look like it should be on the news?
[01:56.310 --> 01:56.650]  Yes.
[01:59.430 --> 02:05.730]  There are people escorting other people into the water to get to another dock.
[02:05.930 --> 02:09.210]  With their belongings over their head and, like, kids held high,
[02:09.310 --> 02:12.270]  it looked like we were surviving a natural disaster.
[02:12.390 --> 02:16.310]  Which I guess we, uh... we were surviving a natural oopsie.
[02:16.970 --> 02:20.090]  So, in the last half hour of being on the boat,
[02:20.250 --> 02:22.130]  it was like... it was killer all day.
[02:22.250 --> 02:24.310]  Like, upper 90s, the water was great.
[02:25.170 --> 02:26.270]  Everything is really nice.
[02:26.270 --> 02:31.950]  In the last half hour, we kind of watched all of the, like,
[02:32.350 --> 02:34.970]  these dark, dark clouds roll in, and we started seeing, like,
[02:35.370 --> 02:36.530]  lightning in the distance.
[02:36.990 --> 02:37.930]  And our captain's like,
[02:37.950 --> 02:40.230]  hey, we can, like, reset, like, where the boat's gonna be,
[02:40.330 --> 02:42.890]  but I gotta get everyone out of the water right now.
[02:42.970 --> 02:44.370]  And we're like, let's just go back to the dock,
[02:44.510 --> 02:45.650]  because we're done. Whatever.
[02:45.950 --> 02:47.630]  He was like, we're probably fine.
[02:47.830 --> 02:49.750]  We can stay out here longer if y'all want.
[02:49.830 --> 02:50.970]  And we were like, you know what? We're good.
[02:51.270 --> 02:53.710]  We'd been out there for, like, three out of our four hours.
[02:54.110 --> 02:55.470]  Three and a half hours, just about.
[02:55.470 --> 02:56.810]  And so we're like, let's just go back to the dock.
[02:56.890 --> 02:57.910]  So we start going back to the dock.
[02:58.650 --> 03:02.770]  It looked like we were in a movie where a natural disaster
[03:02.770 --> 03:04.970]  was about to happen to the boat in front of us,
[03:04.970 --> 03:08.770]  and then to us, so the main character knows that there is danger
[03:08.770 --> 03:09.730]  and the stakes are high.
[03:10.010 --> 03:14.830]  It was so fucking crazy watching the rain catch up to us.
[03:15.270 --> 03:17.770]  Yeah, it was like someone was turning down the draw distance.
[03:17.870 --> 03:19.730]  It was like a wall of mist.
[03:20.030 --> 03:22.950]  It was like a black wall of rain.
[03:22.950 --> 03:24.810]  And it was coming.
[03:25.090 --> 03:28.110]  Let's say we were moving at like 30 miles an hour on the boat.
[03:28.390 --> 03:29.570]  It was going 55.
[03:30.270 --> 03:32.350]  Yes, we got back to the dock.
[03:32.490 --> 03:34.230]  The boat started getting bumped around.
[03:34.370 --> 03:36.350]  We run into the dock, all this stuff, whatever.
[03:36.470 --> 03:37.290]  We get off the boat.
[03:37.590 --> 03:38.710]  We grab all of our stuff.
[03:38.850 --> 03:43.670]  We start racing from the boat because it starts raining on us.
[03:43.690 --> 03:44.590]  And we're like, oh, that's fine.
[03:44.650 --> 03:46.350]  We're getting a little bit wet, whatever.
[03:47.170 --> 03:49.490]  It starts raining so fucking big.
[03:49.530 --> 03:52.750]  It was like getting hit by slugs falling out of the air.
[03:52.750 --> 03:54.230]  It was absolutely crazy.
[03:54.350 --> 03:55.870]  Yeah, really like sharp slugs.
[03:56.250 --> 03:57.550]  Yeah, and then there was hail.
[03:58.830 --> 04:02.390]  And also while we were still on the boat when we were out running it,
[04:02.430 --> 04:04.810]  most of the people were just like facing forward and talking and laughing.
[04:04.990 --> 04:08.050]  I was like glued to the weather because it was it looked like a horror movie.
[04:08.890 --> 04:11.570]  I could see it catching up with us and I was like, we're not going to make it.
[04:11.670 --> 04:12.210]  And we didn't.
[04:12.270 --> 04:14.530]  It caught us like right as we hit the like racing.
[04:14.650 --> 04:17.210]  We got off the boat into as it started raining, which was great.
[04:18.690 --> 04:21.730]  But at some point we looked up, we were making jokes about how like,
[04:21.730 --> 04:22.650]  I hope there's no twisters.
[04:22.870 --> 04:26.570]  And we looked up and there was a fucking like, I know it wasn't a real twister,
[04:27.150 --> 04:30.950]  but there was a funnel cloud forming and we were like, holy shit, that's really happening.
[04:31.270 --> 04:32.910]  And the guy was like, there's another one over there.
[04:32.990 --> 04:34.750]  And there were it was like it was like twisters.
[04:34.870 --> 04:37.910]  It was funny because they just kind of looked like it for I don't know.
[04:37.970 --> 04:38.410]  What do you guys think?
[04:38.450 --> 04:40.010]  Like maybe 45 seconds and then disappeared.
[04:40.010 --> 04:44.610]  But yes, it was briefly scary and kind of like this isn't really happening.
[04:44.830 --> 04:51.130]  So so we're running along the dock getting pelted by the wind, rain and hail.
[04:51.130 --> 04:53.350]  We're under a roof the whole time as well.
[04:53.470 --> 04:56.570]  All that rain that's in us is coming in completely horizontally.
[04:57.150 --> 05:02.630]  Yeah, we make it to where you leave and people start coming back towards us
[05:02.630 --> 05:04.790]  and we're like, what the fuck is going on?
[05:05.570 --> 05:11.490]  The bridge is out and the bridge isn't like big or anything.
[05:11.510 --> 05:16.590]  You kind of see it in Gavin's video, but we have to use it to get onto land.
[05:16.730 --> 05:18.630]  It connects all the docks to the car park.
[05:18.630 --> 05:24.270]  A guy. I mean, these these fucking dude, they live there.
[05:24.450 --> 05:26.150]  I river people.
[05:26.630 --> 05:30.250]  These two dudes that work there who are now most twins.
[05:30.570 --> 05:36.490]  They're these older dudes who are like leathery tan with like sun tattoos.
[05:36.730 --> 05:41.290]  And both of them, both of them look like Joe Exotic.
[05:41.450 --> 05:42.210]  I shit you not.
[05:42.310 --> 05:47.590]  Like, yeah, they would enter a Joe Exotic like lookalike contest to try to win free beer.
[05:47.590 --> 05:49.750]  And they both had both nipple rings.
[05:50.010 --> 05:51.450]  And they're like, we got it.
[05:51.710 --> 05:53.850]  And one of the guys just crawls into the water.
[05:53.990 --> 05:56.350]  And then the other guy goes off for the backhoe, like Eric's saying.
[05:56.450 --> 05:58.590]  But they were like the craziest characters.
[05:58.950 --> 05:59.950]  And they weren't twins.
[06:00.050 --> 06:03.110]  They were just two dudes who had the same look and the same vibe.
[06:03.550 --> 06:03.770]  Yep.
[06:04.610 --> 06:10.390]  So instead of hooking up the bridge, which had a rope that was going to snap, fly back and
[06:10.910 --> 06:16.030]  cut our heads off, instead of tying it to the giant tractor that he had,
[06:16.030 --> 06:22.810]  he attached it to the arm of the big tractor to see if he could pull it, I guess,
[06:23.030 --> 06:25.550]  using the arm instead of just towing it.
[06:26.010 --> 06:29.750]  And I was there with like these like day labor dudes, like construction guys.
[06:30.390 --> 06:31.990]  And we're just kind of like talking shit.
[06:32.330 --> 06:35.490]  And they were like, these guys are fucking up.
[06:35.610 --> 06:36.470]  And I'm like, oh, yeah.
[06:36.630 --> 06:39.950]  And he was like, oh, yeah, this isn't going to fucking work.
[06:40.290 --> 06:43.070]  But he's like, you know, we're just going to get in the water and help people across.
[06:43.190 --> 06:43.990]  This shit's not going to work.
[06:44.430 --> 06:45.170]  And that's what they did.
[06:45.170 --> 06:48.190]  They jumped in the water and they had to help us across.
[06:48.530 --> 06:51.270]  Except Gavin and Meg have already made it across.
[06:51.470 --> 06:54.650]  So Gavin is just watching us laughing and filming us.
[06:54.810 --> 06:58.310]  Yeah, well, I thought this is going to take forever because they were talking about moving
[06:58.310 --> 07:00.030]  the thing into place and pulling the bridge.
[07:00.130 --> 07:01.370]  But you could just swim it.
[07:01.510 --> 07:02.950]  Yeah, and it's not even like swim.
[07:03.010 --> 07:04.490]  It's like it's chest high.
[07:04.690 --> 07:05.670]  It's like not crazy.
[07:06.110 --> 07:09.270]  The downside is you have to like plop down off the dock onto a bunch of rocks.
[07:09.510 --> 07:10.530]  So it was pretty painful.
[07:10.890 --> 07:12.910]  It was so cold.
[07:14.130 --> 07:17.050]  Everybody had their bags and shit, too, you know, so you had to like...
[07:17.050 --> 07:20.570]  Yeah, I will say it was a bit like watching...
[07:20.570 --> 07:21.510]  I had a blast.
[07:21.610 --> 07:22.890]  Like, I was having fun.
[07:23.010 --> 07:26.090]  I would have stayed on that in the rain for another 20 minutes, watching them try to
[07:26.090 --> 07:26.410]  fix it.
[07:26.630 --> 07:28.170]  It was trucks in real life.
[07:28.310 --> 07:29.970]  And it was how trucks goes.
[07:30.130 --> 07:34.470]  Like you and Batdog and Antonio roll up to a thing and you go, well, how are we going
[07:34.470 --> 07:35.030]  to fix this?
[07:35.030 --> 07:36.330]  And you're like, well, I'd go at it this way.
[07:36.350 --> 07:37.730]  And you're like, no, I think we should try this.
[07:37.830 --> 07:38.610]  And I'm like, that's never going to work.
[07:38.790 --> 07:42.710]  And that's what... it was just a bunch of like a bunch of country motherfucking Texas
[07:42.710 --> 07:45.150]  dudes going, that ain't going to work.
[07:45.330 --> 07:46.130]  I wouldn't do that.
[07:47.590 --> 07:50.370]  That dude don't know how to drive a fucking backhoe to save his life.
[07:50.790 --> 07:54.650]  And they were just like under their breath doing how they would fix it.
[07:54.690 --> 07:56.570]  And it felt so much like trucks.
[07:56.710 --> 07:59.290]  I could have stayed there all day watching them try to fix that bridge.
[07:59.630 --> 08:01.110]  It was amazing.
[08:01.410 --> 08:02.330]  It was so fun.
[08:02.410 --> 08:05.530]  But they made us all clear the area when they were trying to pull the thing.
[08:05.610 --> 08:09.490]  Like you had to go back towards the beginning of the bridge and I had to get up the bank.
[08:09.490 --> 08:14.630]  So I was just zooming in on everyone stood on the bridge.
[08:14.730 --> 08:18.390]  And then eventually they gave up and we all went back down and helped everyone in their
[08:18.390 --> 08:19.070]  bags across.
[08:19.210 --> 08:20.230]  Which took 10 seconds.
[08:20.470 --> 08:21.830]  It took no time at all to do that.
[08:22.110 --> 08:25.890]  It was just a thing where people they're like, it's people who just got off boats going,
[08:25.990 --> 08:27.030]  I don't want to get wet.
[08:27.230 --> 08:29.090]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[08:30.990 --> 08:32.490]  It was very cold.
[08:33.050 --> 08:36.130]  We were freezing, like jumping in that water.
[08:36.130 --> 08:38.310]  And then with like the wind blowing, it was really cold.
[08:38.310 --> 08:40.290]  We got home.
[08:40.810 --> 08:42.750]  It rained the whole way home.
[08:42.870 --> 08:43.410]  We got home.
[08:43.550 --> 08:44.790]  It was 72 degrees.
[08:44.950 --> 08:45.910]  I was like fucking floored.
[08:46.050 --> 08:48.670]  I'm like, I'm shivering cold.
[08:48.890 --> 08:50.050]  It's 72 degrees.
[08:50.330 --> 08:51.290]  Take a shower.
[08:51.690 --> 08:54.590]  Put on like a hoodie and shorts.
[08:54.590 --> 08:57.630]  And I'm like, man, at least, you know, at least I'm gonna be nice and warm.
[08:57.830 --> 08:58.670]  I walked outside.
[08:58.790 --> 08:59.490]  It was 97.
[09:02.910 --> 09:04.210]  It was crazy.
[09:04.750 --> 09:11.090]  I gotta say, I don't know that we've done justice just to the walk from the boat to
[09:11.090 --> 09:15.450]  where the bridge was out is like we were there are five docks.
[09:15.570 --> 09:17.010]  We were on the fourth or the fifth dock.
[09:17.210 --> 09:18.650]  It's a long, long walk.
[09:18.790 --> 09:22.830]  And it's like they were saying, like the rain and the wind are coming in sideways and it's
[09:22.830 --> 09:24.030]  slippery as all hell.
[09:24.050 --> 09:29.170]  And you're just like holding bags and trying to move forward and not fall off your ass
[09:29.170 --> 09:30.430]  and hit the concrete or go in the water.
[09:30.510 --> 09:32.230]  It was it was calamitous.
[09:32.290 --> 09:33.490]  That whole journey.
[09:33.490 --> 09:38.270]  It took it probably took four times as long to get from the boat to the to the where the
[09:38.270 --> 09:39.750]  bridge was out as it normally would.
[09:39.830 --> 09:40.470]  It was just nuts.
[09:41.090 --> 09:42.150]  The rain was painful, too.
[09:42.210 --> 09:43.510]  It's a big needle slugs.
[09:43.570 --> 09:44.430]  It hurt.
[09:44.610 --> 09:45.950]  It fucking hurt.
[09:46.130 --> 09:50.870]  And it was crazy because an hour before that, we're just splashing around in the water.
[09:50.950 --> 09:51.610]  It's a hot day.
[09:51.710 --> 09:52.970]  Everything was fine and regular.
[09:52.970 --> 09:54.230]  And it was so to summer.
[09:54.250 --> 09:57.850]  So we're just like crushing cans of like polar seltzer.
[09:57.950 --> 09:58.810]  It was fucking awesome.
[09:58.950 --> 09:59.670]  It rocked.
[09:59.770 --> 10:00.610]  It was a great day.
[10:01.390 --> 10:03.470]  How many years have we done that now?
[10:04.430 --> 10:05.490]  Three or four.
[10:05.830 --> 10:06.050]  Four.
[10:06.470 --> 10:06.590]  Wow.
[10:06.770 --> 10:07.310]  That's fun like that.
[10:07.730 --> 10:07.930]  Yeah.
[10:08.250 --> 10:08.410]  Yeah.
[10:08.450 --> 10:09.210]  I love the boat.
[10:09.330 --> 10:09.550]  Boats.
[10:09.630 --> 10:10.330]  I love that tradition.
[10:10.550 --> 10:10.750]  Yeah.
[10:10.970 --> 10:11.150]  Yeah.
[10:11.630 --> 10:12.230]  Love the boat.
[10:12.370 --> 10:17.310]  It was just like we just experienced all weather within like 35 minutes.
[10:17.890 --> 10:18.550]  We did.
[10:18.730 --> 10:19.190]  We did.
[10:19.430 --> 10:21.890]  I've never just experienced that much weather in my life.
[10:22.290 --> 10:22.950]  It was crazy.
[10:23.350 --> 10:27.090]  I was really I was like 20% scared of getting struck by lightning.
[10:27.750 --> 10:28.610]  Oh, big time.
[10:28.610 --> 10:34.010]  Dude, the lightning was like not far and we were in the water.
[10:34.710 --> 10:36.170]  It was it was bad.
[10:36.370 --> 10:36.710]  It was bad.
[10:36.810 --> 10:38.550]  Are you safe on a boat or dangerous?
[10:38.710 --> 10:39.470]  Is it dangerous on a boat?
[10:40.490 --> 10:43.450]  Depends on if the boat has a rubber band around it, I believe.
[10:46.590 --> 10:47.430]  Neutralizes on lightning.
[10:47.670 --> 10:50.410]  I think as long as you're touching metal, you're fine.
[10:55.470 --> 10:58.090]  It was a it was a fun boat day otherwise, though.
[10:58.090 --> 10:59.670]  It was a very good time.
[11:00.190 --> 11:01.610]  Gavin jumped off the top.
[11:02.810 --> 11:03.630]  It was fun.
[11:03.950 --> 11:04.870]  Everyone had a good time.
[11:05.310 --> 11:05.430]  Yeah.
[11:05.650 --> 11:09.650]  Isn't that a thing with cars that they're resistant to lightning because of the rubber
[11:09.650 --> 11:10.350]  and the wheels?
[11:10.750 --> 11:11.810]  Am I making that up?
[11:11.990 --> 11:14.530]  I mean, that's certainly what people told me when I was a kid.
[11:15.010 --> 11:16.290]  Yeah, I think you're safe in a car.
[11:18.390 --> 11:22.110]  It'd be interesting to like where the safe zones are and not safe zones,
[11:22.390 --> 11:25.590]  because I would not naturally think the car would be a safe zone.
[11:25.590 --> 11:28.550]  I wonder if the boat is more safe than a car.
[11:29.030 --> 11:29.950]  I don't know.
[11:30.650 --> 11:32.210]  Does lightning hit water?
[11:33.250 --> 11:34.290]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11:34.630 --> 11:37.130]  That must look cool at the point of explosion.
[11:38.290 --> 11:42.270]  That's why like if there's a lightning storm or whatever and you're in a resort
[11:42.270 --> 11:45.770]  or like a pool, they'll make everybody get out of the pool.
[11:45.990 --> 11:46.210]  Yeah.
[11:46.710 --> 11:48.070]  And then I just go to the ocean.
[11:48.530 --> 11:50.230]  So I'm there for some water.
[11:51.550 --> 11:52.950]  Get some bigger sea going.
[11:53.370 --> 11:53.830]  There you go.
[11:54.450 --> 11:56.530]  It'll disperse the electricity and make you safer.
[11:56.730 --> 11:57.250]  It will.
[11:57.510 --> 11:59.790]  Maybe I'll turn into the blue guy from Watchmen.
[12:00.050 --> 12:01.090]  It's the worst that'll happen.
[12:01.590 --> 12:02.710]  I'm pretty OK with it.
[12:02.850 --> 12:03.790]  Would your cock be out?
[12:04.430 --> 12:05.870]  I mean, cock's always out.
[12:07.290 --> 12:08.270]  Why wouldn't it be?
[12:10.030 --> 12:12.170]  Would you think this is a special event?
[12:12.810 --> 12:14.830]  Do you really have to get out of the water during lightning?
[12:15.030 --> 12:16.970]  Fish don't get out of the water and they seem fine.
[12:17.690 --> 12:18.610]  That's a great point.
[12:18.950 --> 12:20.090]  I have no argument against it.
[12:20.130 --> 12:21.850]  I think fish die from lightning strikes.
[12:21.850 --> 12:22.510]  Yeah.
[12:23.270 --> 12:25.390]  I never met a fish that died of a lightning strike.
[12:25.870 --> 12:27.450]  I don't meet many fish.
[12:28.250 --> 12:31.890]  Imagine all the fish walking out of the sea.
[12:32.530 --> 12:33.170]  Like, again?
[12:34.010 --> 12:34.850]  Once again?
[12:35.830 --> 12:37.290]  Three times this week.
[12:38.270 --> 12:41.230]  Every time I go to try to see Deadpool, Wolverine or Twisters,
[12:41.410 --> 12:43.270]  the movies of the summer that you should definitely see.
[12:44.170 --> 12:45.550]  There's a lightning storm.
[12:45.950 --> 12:48.010]  Would you eat fish that was struck by lightning?
[12:48.430 --> 12:48.730]  Of course.
[12:49.310 --> 12:49.830]  Oh, yeah.
[12:49.910 --> 12:50.170]  Yeah.
[12:50.350 --> 12:50.870]  Yeah, definitely.
[12:50.870 --> 12:53.210]  I would pay a premium for it.
[12:53.430 --> 12:56.370]  That would that would turn me into the blue guy from Watchmen.
[12:56.730 --> 13:01.170]  See, I think that would give me like 10% flash where I'm not the flash, but I'm faster.
[13:02.770 --> 13:03.690]  You're like flashy.
[13:04.110 --> 13:07.730]  Yeah, like my speed would increase, but I'm not like the flash.
[13:08.290 --> 13:09.110]  Does that be insane?
[13:09.310 --> 13:11.650]  According to the Internet, if fish are near the surface,
[13:11.650 --> 13:13.310]  they can be killed by lightning strikes.
[13:13.430 --> 13:17.070]  Water, though, is a good conductor and tends to keep the electricity near the surface.
[13:17.070 --> 13:21.910]  So any fish in water that's more than two meters deep generally won't even feel it.
[13:22.330 --> 13:23.530]  So you just got to be six feet down.
[13:23.690 --> 13:27.810]  So as long as I swim, as long as, yeah, you swim under the water, you're fine.
[13:28.130 --> 13:28.310]  Yeah.
[13:28.690 --> 13:30.830]  It's like an action movie whenever there's an explosion.
[13:31.150 --> 13:34.010]  Like, as long as you're like one foot under, you're good.
[13:34.550 --> 13:34.810]  Yeah.
[13:35.330 --> 13:36.010]  Don't worry about it.
[13:36.010 --> 13:39.910]  It's like when they shoot you, like when there's like bullets in like the water or whatever,
[13:39.990 --> 13:40.170]  right?
[13:40.210 --> 13:41.010]  Like that's not like...
[13:41.870 --> 13:43.850]  Can't kill someone with a gun if they're swimming, right?
[13:43.970 --> 13:44.770]  Like if they're underwater.
[13:45.370 --> 13:45.650]  It's true.
[13:46.170 --> 13:46.710]  That's true.
[13:47.410 --> 13:47.990]  Is it?
[13:48.170 --> 13:49.610]  Like that's like a Mythbusters thing, right?
[13:49.690 --> 13:50.630]  Like they test it.
[13:51.150 --> 13:52.510]  Yeah, like what really slows them down.
[13:53.010 --> 13:53.730]  Turns them all around.
[13:53.870 --> 13:54.770]  They tumble in that.
[13:55.350 --> 13:57.430]  Slows them down, turns them all around.
[13:57.910 --> 13:58.850]  Yeah, like it shreds them.
[13:58.910 --> 13:59.550]  They just fall to pieces.
[13:59.770 --> 14:02.450]  They do the hokey pokey and you're safe from guns.
[14:02.470 --> 14:03.410]  100 bullets of...
[14:04.370 --> 14:05.630]  And that's what it's all about.
[14:06.050 --> 14:07.650]  Shoot one down, tumble around.
[14:08.910 --> 14:10.010]  That reminds me of...
[14:11.050 --> 14:12.230]  Oh, what was the movie called?
[14:13.310 --> 14:15.290]  It would be such a great group watch.
[14:15.290 --> 14:15.850]  It is...
[14:16.710 --> 14:18.770]  Val Kilmer is in it for one scene.
[14:18.910 --> 14:20.910]  Christian Slater is in it for one scene.
[14:21.630 --> 14:23.230]  LL Cool J is in it.
[14:25.430 --> 14:26.410]  Fuck, what is this?
[14:26.870 --> 14:27.350]  Masterminds?
[14:27.350 --> 14:27.670]  Criminal?
[14:28.750 --> 14:29.350]  It is...
[14:29.350 --> 14:30.430]  Are any of them called Andrew?
[14:31.270 --> 14:32.230]  I don't...
[14:33.130 --> 14:34.490]  There actually might be a character.
[14:34.870 --> 14:35.350]  Mindhunters?
[14:35.930 --> 14:37.190]  Yeah, Mindhunters.
[14:37.390 --> 14:39.030]  I love Mindhunters so much.
[14:39.370 --> 14:40.570]  And it is the ultimate...
[14:41.510 --> 14:43.890]  I need you guys to see this fucking...
[14:43.890 --> 14:44.530]  Look at...
[14:44.530 --> 14:45.830]  We really need to watch it.
[14:45.910 --> 14:48.310]  It's one of my favorite bad movies of all time.
[14:48.830 --> 14:49.730]  What's going on there?
[14:49.830 --> 14:50.890]  It has bad movie font.
[14:51.050 --> 14:51.450]  Look at that.
[14:51.810 --> 14:53.950]  Everything about it says bad movie.
[14:54.550 --> 14:55.850]  So this is the premise of Mindhunters.
[14:56.090 --> 14:57.650]  They are their go-to...
[14:57.650 --> 15:02.110]  They're an FBI program specializing in dealing with serial killers.
[15:02.450 --> 15:04.510]  And they're going to like the training for it.
[15:04.730 --> 15:06.490]  But there's a serial killer in their mix.
[15:06.910 --> 15:09.490]  And they're exploiting their weaknesses against them,
[15:09.710 --> 15:11.310]  taking them out one at a time.
[15:11.430 --> 15:12.750]  And it is great.
[15:12.750 --> 15:15.510]  And they break away from that premise almost immediately.
[15:16.350 --> 15:19.710]  But the final fight...
[15:19.710 --> 15:21.370]  And that film is two people underwater.
[15:21.550 --> 15:23.290]  And they try to shoot each other underwater.
[15:23.830 --> 15:25.110]  And the bullets just don't go.
[15:25.690 --> 15:29.010]  So then they both put their pistols above the water
[15:29.010 --> 15:34.010]  and have a hold your breath contest to see who will survive the shootout.
[15:34.330 --> 15:36.310]  And it's fucking awesome.
[15:36.650 --> 15:37.610]  It's so stupid.
[15:37.830 --> 15:39.510]  I love that movie so much.
[15:39.810 --> 15:40.590]  It's great.
[15:41.390 --> 15:44.070]  So it's just two guns sticking out of the water, pointing at each other.
[15:44.070 --> 15:47.350]  It's just two hands with pistols sticking out of the water,
[15:47.750 --> 15:49.050]  pointing in each other's directions.
[15:49.430 --> 15:51.430]  And that is how that film is resolved.
[15:51.890 --> 15:52.770]  Johnny Lee Miller.
[15:52.950 --> 15:54.370]  That's the dude from the Hackers.
[15:54.770 --> 15:55.870]  Yeah, he's in it.
[15:56.550 --> 15:57.690]  Where is he on the poster?
[15:57.950 --> 15:58.470]  Is he in the background?
[15:58.670 --> 15:59.370]  He's not on the poster.
[16:00.290 --> 16:02.050]  Oh, maybe he's in the silhouetted there.
[16:03.010 --> 16:06.570]  The fact that Val Kilmer and Christian Slater are on the poster is hilarious
[16:06.570 --> 16:10.570]  because they probably have a combined five minutes of screen time in Mindhunters.
[16:11.260 --> 16:14.010]  They are not prevalent in that movie at all.
[16:14.150 --> 16:15.950]  I want this to be the next movie we watch.
[16:16.130 --> 16:17.710]  It has to be in consideration.
[16:18.050 --> 16:22.550]  It is directed by a guy that has only made schlocky movies.
[16:22.990 --> 16:27.390]  He's my favorite bad film director because they're all fun bad.
[16:27.630 --> 16:29.570]  They're unbelievably fun bad movies.
[16:29.690 --> 16:30.810]  Everything he's ever done.
[16:31.530 --> 16:34.410]  He directed 12 rounds, which is...
[16:34.410 --> 16:34.910]  Oh, wow.
[16:35.130 --> 16:38.270]  The John Cena Die Hard 3 ripoff.
[16:38.370 --> 16:39.150]  Rennie Harlan?
[16:39.150 --> 16:41.270]  Rennie Harlan is my guy.
[16:41.950 --> 16:43.770]  Mindhunters is a Rennie Harlan film?
[16:44.250 --> 16:45.470]  Dude, he produced...
[16:45.470 --> 16:46.150]  Oh, my God.
[16:46.170 --> 16:47.330]  He produced Cutthroat Island?
[16:47.710 --> 16:48.390]  Oh, my God.
[16:49.810 --> 16:52.310]  He did Long Kiss Goodnight, didn't he?
[16:52.590 --> 16:53.090]  Yes, he did.
[16:53.090 --> 16:53.610]  I think so.
[16:54.470 --> 16:55.810]  Another fun bad movie.
[16:56.430 --> 17:02.890]  Everything he has made that I've seen is entertaining and just like, this is really stupid.
[17:03.910 --> 17:05.410]  What did he do?
[17:06.470 --> 17:06.790]  Driven.
[17:06.970 --> 17:07.490]  Die Hard 2.
[17:08.090 --> 17:08.610]  Yeah, driven.
[17:09.410 --> 17:09.730]  Driven.
[17:10.250 --> 17:10.470]  Cliffhanger.
[17:10.790 --> 17:13.890]  I think, uh, who is in Driven?
[17:15.210 --> 17:17.790]  Yeah, uh, Matt Hullum worked on that.
[17:18.290 --> 17:18.910]  Oh, did he really?
[17:19.250 --> 17:20.070]  He's actually in it.
[17:20.130 --> 17:21.490]  He CGI'd himself into the movie.
[17:21.950 --> 17:22.810]  Oh, that's awesome.
[17:23.030 --> 17:27.450]  There's like a scene where one of the tires flies off a car in a crash and it like hits
[17:27.450 --> 17:28.250]  people in the stands.
[17:28.410 --> 17:30.210]  And Matt put himself as one of the people that gets hit.
[17:30.670 --> 17:33.850]  So if you ever watch that film, you can see him like a young Matt, like, hold his hands
[17:33.850 --> 17:35.770]  up like, ah, that's so funny.
[17:35.770 --> 17:43.350]  He directed, uh, Die Hard 2, which for the TV edit has the best line of yippee-ki-yay
[17:43.350 --> 17:44.090]  Mr. Falcon.
[17:44.470 --> 17:45.790]  And then he blows up a plane.
[17:46.110 --> 17:48.930]  He did the Adventures of Ford Fairlane, which I own on DVD.
[17:49.410 --> 17:50.490]  Wow, dude.
[17:50.490 --> 17:50.810]  That's great.
[17:50.990 --> 17:51.290]  Cliffhanger.
[17:52.130 --> 17:55.830]  Dude, we might, we might have to, we might have to watch Mindhunters.
[17:56.490 --> 17:57.670]  We have to, yeah, absolutely.
[17:58.550 --> 18:00.790]  Might be a Falcon stream watching some Mindhunters, dude.
[18:01.130 --> 18:02.850]  Get on that Patreon Falcon stream.
[18:03.210 --> 18:04.650]  Like, we do that monthly.
[18:04.650 --> 18:06.850]  Every month we do one thing for Falcons.
[18:07.010 --> 18:07.610]  It might be this.
[18:08.310 --> 18:13.550]  It is, uh, if I win the movie league, it's in, it's a definite consideration for me for
[18:13.550 --> 18:15.190]  picking what the movie will be that we watch.
[18:15.910 --> 18:16.650]  It's up there.
[18:16.730 --> 18:20.710]  It's also, I'm meaning to share with you guys some very exciting news, because last time
[18:20.710 --> 18:24.990]  we looked at it and another one of these that talked about watching, but it was not
[18:24.990 --> 18:25.890]  available at the time.
[18:26.810 --> 18:28.930]  Blast is now available on streaming.
[18:29.310 --> 18:31.050]  You can rent Blast digitally.
[18:31.050 --> 18:31.830]  Finally.
[18:32.730 --> 18:39.730]  I don't know what deal got passed, but the Eddie Griffin Breckenmayer action film that
[18:39.730 --> 18:45.870]  I thought was awesome as a child, which does not hold up, is available.
[18:46.450 --> 18:47.350]  We've got to do this.
[18:47.690 --> 18:48.510]  That's exciting.
[18:49.210 --> 18:50.010]  Those are my top two.
[18:50.410 --> 18:51.850]  That's why I want to win the summer movie league.
[18:52.150 --> 18:56.630]  There's going to be one that we have to watch and it's going to make us go, oh, the joke
[18:56.630 --> 18:58.850]  doesn't, oh no, oh, don't say that.
[18:59.090 --> 18:59.810]  I think it's going to be a lot of that.
[18:59.810 --> 19:01.390]  We already watched Condor, man.
[19:01.530 --> 19:02.330]  It surely can't be worse.
[19:02.550 --> 19:03.510]  No, it's not worse.
[19:03.610 --> 19:06.110]  The Disney children's film Condor, man.
[19:06.270 --> 19:07.410]  Surely it can't be worse.
[19:08.610 --> 19:09.130]  Man.
[19:09.510 --> 19:12.190]  Blast is, yeah, has a chance of being offensive.
[19:12.370 --> 19:13.750]  Mine Hunters is just stupid.
[19:14.230 --> 19:20.590]  We're like the premise is he uses their weaknesses against them, but they run out of weaknesses
[19:20.590 --> 19:21.370]  really quickly.
[19:21.550 --> 19:24.590]  So they just drop the premise of like.
[19:25.370 --> 19:31.010]  So they they kill like someone dies because they like sugar in their tea and they're like
[19:31.010 --> 19:31.990]  that is his weakness.
[19:32.290 --> 19:36.430]  And it's like that doesn't that doesn't make sense where somebody else dies because they
[19:36.430 --> 19:37.470]  have a smoking thing.
[19:37.770 --> 19:40.130]  But it's it's oh, it's great.
[19:40.630 --> 19:41.550]  What a dumb movie.
[19:43.090 --> 19:44.130]  I can't wait for us to watch it.
[19:44.650 --> 19:48.530]  Who would you say is the best and pulls off the best performance in the film?
[19:50.710 --> 19:52.390]  Oh, I haven't seen it in a while.
[19:52.390 --> 19:59.190]  This was a movie that I found on cable and just came in like 40 minutes in and I've seen
[19:59.190 --> 20:02.290]  it like probably four times on cable throughout time.
[20:02.390 --> 20:03.450]  I haven't watched it recently.
[20:03.850 --> 20:04.270]  Oh, cool.
[20:04.330 --> 20:04.930]  Jay's fine.
[20:05.490 --> 20:07.090]  He gives a fine performance, I'd say.
[20:08.230 --> 20:10.910]  Jonny Lee Miller does the Jonny Lee Miller thing.
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.110]  Yeah, like he he delivers.
[20:14.170 --> 20:16.950]  There's not like you're not going to walk away from this going like, oh, that was a
[20:16.950 --> 20:22.370]  good performance for many like Christian Slater movie that he did right when he went to jail.
[20:23.110 --> 20:25.910]  That was about rain.
[20:26.350 --> 20:27.470]  He went to jail.
[20:27.770 --> 20:28.450]  Hard rain.
[20:28.690 --> 20:29.310]  Heavy, hard rain.
[20:29.830 --> 20:31.590]  Heavy rain, something like that.
[20:31.590 --> 20:32.490]  Like a flood.
[20:32.810 --> 20:34.470]  And there was a hard rain.
[20:34.490 --> 20:35.930]  The Morgan Freeman movie.
[20:35.990 --> 20:36.810]  Morgan Freeman was in it.
[20:36.850 --> 20:37.510]  Yeah, I want to see that.
[20:37.570 --> 20:37.690]  Yeah.
[20:38.430 --> 20:40.250]  You want to see hard rain again?
[20:40.610 --> 20:41.010]  Yeah.
[20:41.210 --> 20:41.770]  Why not?
[20:41.810 --> 20:42.270]  I haven't seen this.
[20:42.350 --> 20:43.550]  Well, he just went through it.
[20:43.570 --> 20:44.510]  So it makes sense.
[20:44.570 --> 20:45.650]  He wants to like reconnect.
[20:46.030 --> 20:46.270]  Came out.
[20:46.330 --> 20:46.830]  That's me.
[20:47.090 --> 20:49.130]  I'm just like Christian Slater and hard rain.
[20:49.170 --> 20:50.450]  It rained so hard on me.
[20:51.010 --> 20:52.830]  I remember liking it when it came out.
[20:53.150 --> 20:54.130]  I want to see it again.
[20:54.930 --> 20:57.490]  It is a movie that apparently has a really good villain death.
[20:57.710 --> 21:02.270]  When we're doing that draft, I saw it mentioned by a few different websites.
[21:02.590 --> 21:05.450]  It's got Randy Quaid, Ed Asner in it.
[21:05.990 --> 21:06.430]  Fuck.
[21:06.610 --> 21:07.170]  Minnie Driver.
[21:07.430 --> 21:08.350]  Can't go wrong with that.
[21:09.390 --> 21:10.510]  Betty White's in it.
[21:11.090 --> 21:11.950]  I'm fucking sold.
[21:12.090 --> 21:15.850]  Speaking of drafts, y'all got to step your game up a little bit.
[21:16.370 --> 21:18.790]  I got the triple crown winner over here.
[21:19.130 --> 21:20.010]  Did you win the last one?
[21:20.010 --> 21:22.850]  I've won all three of the last drafts we've done.
[21:23.010 --> 21:24.770]  I'm on a three draft winning streak.
[21:26.130 --> 21:27.850]  And now this is according to who?
[21:27.930 --> 21:28.630]  What do you mean?
[21:29.030 --> 21:32.450]  You won the official Patreon poll that we do.
[21:32.830 --> 21:34.990]  That I have won the last three.
[21:36.090 --> 21:37.030]  God damn it.
[21:37.730 --> 21:38.050]  Wow.
[21:39.410 --> 21:40.710]  Yeah, get into it.
[21:40.750 --> 21:41.410]  Nick was close.
[21:41.690 --> 21:43.110]  So you always win the drafts.
[21:43.470 --> 21:44.730]  Eric always wins the bingo.
[21:46.030 --> 21:49.370]  We have to come up with more games for everybody to always win.
[21:49.370 --> 21:50.730]  I need to find my game.
[21:52.750 --> 21:55.550]  Your game is good streaming advice, I think.
[21:55.830 --> 21:59.070]  You always come out on top of the streaming tips.
[22:01.010 --> 22:04.590]  Have y'all heard that the flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading
[22:04.590 --> 22:06.190]  alternative to vaping and smoking?
[22:06.390 --> 22:10.110]  It's a whole new movement towards better habits led by today's sponsor, Fume.
[22:10.370 --> 22:14.030]  We've teamed up with Fume and they're offering you a free gift with your Journey Pack.
[22:14.290 --> 22:16.530]  Head to tryfume.com regulation.
[22:16.530 --> 22:19.790]  That's tryfume.com regulation.
[22:20.930 --> 22:23.150]  Fume is an award-winning flavored air device.
[22:23.670 --> 22:25.250]  Flavored air, it's not like vaping.
[22:25.470 --> 22:29.410]  If vapor was compared to sticky soda, Fume cores are closer to herbal teas.
[22:29.930 --> 22:33.510]  Fume has lots of delicious flavors to choose from, like crisp mint and orange vanilla.
[22:33.910 --> 22:37.710]  With flavored air, you can satisfy your oral fixation through a passive diffusion system
[22:37.710 --> 22:40.690]  that utilizes no electronics, vapor, or combustion.
[22:41.610 --> 22:43.930]  Fume fills the void ditching a bad habit can leave.
[22:44.050 --> 22:45.550]  You still have something to reach for.
[22:45.550 --> 22:46.490]  It's not a vape.
[22:46.610 --> 22:47.250]  There's no vapor.
[22:47.370 --> 22:48.390]  You can use it anywhere.
[22:48.550 --> 22:49.110]  No nicotine.
[22:49.270 --> 22:49.970]  It's not addictive.
[22:50.090 --> 22:51.090]  Non-toxic flavors.
[22:51.410 --> 22:53.130]  It's a guilt-free alternative.
[22:53.590 --> 22:57.250]  Fume continuously invests in third-party studies to ensure the safety of their products and is
[22:57.250 --> 22:58.930]  backed by doctors in the U.S.
[22:58.950 --> 22:59.790]  No batteries needed.
[23:00.050 --> 23:01.410]  You'll never need to charge it.
[23:01.730 --> 23:03.390]  So I just received my Journey Pack.
[23:03.510 --> 23:05.170]  I love how solid the Fume is.
[23:05.250 --> 23:09.090]  I love knowing it's there in my pocket if I need something to reach for while I'm out and about
[23:09.090 --> 23:12.770]  or if you're ever just feeling nervous or a little anxious.
[23:12.770 --> 23:15.610]  It's also made to be fidgeted with so you can take it out.
[23:16.290 --> 23:18.250]  It has this little magnet that snaps and clicks.
[23:18.550 --> 23:21.190]  It's really relaxing and, you know, something to distract you.
[23:21.210 --> 23:23.230]  Just take your mind off of stuff if you need it every once in a while.
[23:23.530 --> 23:25.510]  And so far, loving the flavors.
[23:25.670 --> 23:28.890]  So far, Crispmint is my favorite, but I can't wait to try some of the others.
[23:29.830 --> 23:33.610]  Fume has served over 300,000 customers and you can be the next success story.

[23:44.770 --> 23:45.430]  Thanks, Fume.
[23:45.890 --> 23:49.490]  Have you guys played any of the college football game?
[23:49.950 --> 23:50.810]  Came out a few weeks ago.
[23:52.110 --> 23:54.750]  Mainly Nick, Geoff, or Eric.
[23:54.830 --> 23:56.190]  It would be crazy if you did, Gavin.
[23:56.230 --> 23:57.850]  If you were like, yeah, I can't put it down.
[23:58.150 --> 24:01.290]  Everything I read about it is people being miserable playing it.
[24:01.310 --> 24:02.750]  So I haven't bothered to touch it yet.
[24:03.330 --> 24:04.370]  What are they saying about it?
[24:04.610 --> 24:05.710]  They said it's hard.
[24:07.030 --> 24:09.790]  I think too realistic and that's bothering people.
[24:10.210 --> 24:10.990]  I'm sure I will.
[24:10.990 --> 24:14.750]  I just like, it's gonna be one of those things where I play it and I go, oh, this is fucking
[24:14.750 --> 24:15.030]  awesome.
[24:15.450 --> 24:17.230]  I love, I forgot that I love football games.
[24:17.370 --> 24:21.410]  And then I'll, after like one season, I'll go, this is the same fucking football game
[24:21.410 --> 24:22.370]  as the last 25 years.
[24:22.730 --> 24:23.750]  I'm already bored with this.
[24:23.850 --> 24:26.450]  Why did I think I wanted to play this more than $10 worth?
[24:26.590 --> 24:28.590]  And then, you know, it's just, I'll just leave it.
[24:28.930 --> 24:30.830]  I feel that way every time I play a Pokemon game.
[24:31.150 --> 24:34.770]  I get an hour and I'm like, oh yeah, it's just, it's just this shit.
[24:35.230 --> 24:37.430]  You never liked, you've never gotten into a Pokemon game?
[24:37.910 --> 24:38.770]  I liked it when I was a kid.
[24:38.790 --> 24:39.490]  I liked Pokemon Yellow.
[24:39.990 --> 24:40.190]  Yeah.
[24:40.190 --> 24:41.130]  Played the shit out of it.
[24:41.430 --> 24:43.170]  But it's just, I feel like they've not added a ton.
[24:43.950 --> 24:44.690]  You got to catch them all.
[24:45.890 --> 24:48.030]  I've never, I've actually never caught them all.
[24:48.370 --> 24:51.570]  Once you catch them all in the one game, why the fuck do you want to do it again in the
[24:51.570 --> 24:53.070]  next game if it's the same game?
[24:53.470 --> 24:54.090]  It's the same football.
[24:54.250 --> 24:56.510]  I love, I love video games.
[24:56.570 --> 25:02.810]  I love sports video games, but they always wear down really fast because you just can't,
[25:03.130 --> 25:03.610]  football's football.
[25:03.790 --> 25:05.970]  They can only make so many innovations into the gameplay, you know?
[25:06.470 --> 25:12.710]  So what has been different for me with college is as someone who doesn't have a college affiliation
[25:12.710 --> 25:15.530]  and doesn't really have a Canadian presence for college football.
[25:15.810 --> 25:20.850]  I've always struggled to find an investment point, but I've heard from college football
[25:20.850 --> 25:27.550]  fans like the constant complaints of the rankings are bullshit and none of this works and everything
[25:27.550 --> 25:29.630]  is fucked with how it happens.
[25:30.230 --> 25:37.030]  And as somebody who has been leading the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors, let me tell you, I got issues
[25:37.030 --> 25:37.810]  with these votes.
[25:37.950 --> 25:39.430]  I don't like the media polls.
[25:39.930 --> 25:42.270]  I am undefeated in my season.
[25:42.450 --> 25:46.210]  I didn't even make the college football playoff in my undefeated season.
[25:46.790 --> 25:48.410]  They just bumped me at the last second.
[25:48.810 --> 25:50.250]  The rankings don't make sense.
[25:50.690 --> 25:54.750]  They're always pushing down the smaller schools for the big ones, regardless of the results.
[25:54.750 --> 26:00.890]  In one season of playing this game, it made me get everything that I've heard people complain about.
[26:01.050 --> 26:03.470]  And I feel like I understand college football now.
[26:03.550 --> 26:07.710]  They made the game the way Gavin wanted to make our movie draft.
[26:08.410 --> 26:11.010]  Where he gets all the money every year.
[26:11.210 --> 26:11.590]  I re-listened to that.
[26:11.850 --> 26:12.950]  What the fuck?
[26:13.150 --> 26:17.230]  I re-listened to it today and I was just like, what were you thinking saying that?
[26:17.430 --> 26:18.970]  What are you talking about?
[26:19.150 --> 26:23.090]  I want to have 128 points and I want Nick to have 16.
[26:23.090 --> 26:24.610]  Is what you said.
[26:25.630 --> 26:26.950]  I'm doing the shit he picks.
[26:27.050 --> 26:28.450]  He's going to have to work his way back up.
[26:32.250 --> 26:34.490]  But on top of that.
[26:35.210 --> 26:39.110]  So I picked the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors because I wanted to pick a school that didn't have,
[26:39.370 --> 26:41.310]  according to the game, a lot of prestige.
[26:42.030 --> 26:42.810]  Smaller school.
[26:43.670 --> 26:46.930]  And I've been dominating with the running back on my team.
[26:47.110 --> 26:50.330]  And it just occurred to me last night that they might be a real person.
[26:50.910 --> 26:51.530]  And they are.
[26:51.870 --> 26:56.870]  So now I'm all invested on Cam Barfield, the running back for the Hawaiian Warriors.
[26:57.810 --> 26:58.450]  Rainbow Warriors.
[26:59.290 --> 27:00.690]  I don't know if they'll get drafted.
[27:00.890 --> 27:02.330]  I don't know if they'll have any career at all.
[27:02.770 --> 27:07.130]  But because of this game, I am now a huge athletic fan of that guy.
[27:07.490 --> 27:08.770]  And I think that's really cool.
[27:09.170 --> 27:09.790]  Can I ask a question?
[27:09.850 --> 27:11.010]  I think that is very cool, by the way.
[27:11.090 --> 27:11.690]  Can I ask a question?
[27:12.030 --> 27:12.350]  Of course.
[27:12.490 --> 27:14.310]  Is there...
[27:14.310 --> 27:16.030]  I haven't played the game, so I don't know how it works.
[27:16.110 --> 27:18.630]  But I assume you're playing like a franchise mode.
[27:18.630 --> 27:23.090]  So you will then go into the offseason, deal with recruiting and all that stuff,
[27:23.090 --> 27:24.550]  and then start the next season.
[27:24.850 --> 27:30.530]  Is there a potential for players to leave via the transport portal?
[27:30.770 --> 27:31.030]  Yes.
[27:31.350 --> 27:33.290]  Without you being able to control it?
[27:33.550 --> 27:33.850]  Oh, yeah.
[27:33.950 --> 27:34.310]  Oh, yeah.
[27:34.650 --> 27:39.350]  Isn't that a huge danger when you're playing a team like as a team like Hawaii to really
[27:39.350 --> 27:44.490]  have a huge breakout star on your tiny, like, I don't know,
[27:44.490 --> 27:49.030]  division three team and then end up having them leave immediately,
[27:49.190 --> 27:51.630]  like punishing you by leaving immediately to go play for Iowa or something?
[27:52.090 --> 27:53.050]  No, you're saying that, Geoff.
[27:53.250 --> 27:55.430]  But we we're building a special culture here.
[27:55.530 --> 27:56.930]  OK, this Hawaiian program.
[27:57.190 --> 27:58.530]  My guys are bought in.
[27:58.910 --> 27:59.870]  We're doing good.
[28:00.070 --> 28:04.410]  The only people that I've tried to transfer are people that are not getting the reps they want,
[28:04.450 --> 28:05.690]  which are too bad.
[28:05.950 --> 28:07.050]  I got to start running back here.
[28:07.070 --> 28:07.830]  I'm going to feed him.
[28:08.090 --> 28:09.250]  I'm not going to get everybody in the flow.
[28:09.310 --> 28:10.270]  You can leave if you want.
[28:10.970 --> 28:12.830]  So you're sort of a Deion Sanders then?
[28:13.210 --> 28:13.870]  Yeah, exactly.
[28:13.870 --> 28:19.590]  Yes, I'm running the hot dog express offense and we've been cleaning up.
[28:19.710 --> 28:22.890]  Now, are you are you just calling plays or are you actually playing the game?
[28:22.990 --> 28:24.110]  I'm playing all the offense.
[28:24.650 --> 28:25.610]  OK, you play defense?
[28:25.890 --> 28:26.890]  Don't play defense.
[28:27.170 --> 28:27.790]  Only play offense.
[28:28.750 --> 28:32.230]  I don't know how football works, so I don't feel comfortable playing defense.
[28:32.410 --> 28:35.070]  What? You don't know how football works?
[28:35.490 --> 28:37.630]  There's like different levels of understanding football.
[28:38.050 --> 28:42.790]  Like I know what they do, but I don't know what like a four three offenses or they're in.
[28:42.790 --> 28:43.790]  Oh, like you're trying.
[28:43.930 --> 28:45.630]  You can't figure out like read option stuff.
[28:45.750 --> 28:50.410]  Yeah, I don't I don't know the terminologies of like this defense means this.
[28:50.550 --> 28:55.190]  And because they're in this formation, like I am in, I can process, hey, that guy's open.
[28:55.610 --> 28:58.850]  I should throw the ball to that guy or there's a hole here.
[28:58.930 --> 28:59.910]  Run through that hole.
[29:00.170 --> 29:01.070]  I get that.
[29:01.210 --> 29:01.910]  So I play offense.
[29:02.610 --> 29:03.690]  I think that's probably most people.
[29:04.490 --> 29:08.070]  Honestly, I feel that is, yeah, the overwhelming defense is unsexy.
[29:08.390 --> 29:12.650]  You know, I feel like the first rule of becoming a sports fan is just coming
[29:12.650 --> 29:15.690]  to terms with you have opinions that are not at all informed.
[29:16.090 --> 29:17.230]  And just ride that.
[29:17.770 --> 29:19.050]  That's that's the whole point.
[29:19.510 --> 29:20.310]  It's kind of the joy of it.
[29:20.390 --> 29:21.190]  Yeah, it is.
[29:21.290 --> 29:21.510]  Yeah.
[29:23.050 --> 29:29.150]  Even a yell at insanely athletic people for underperforming when you have no ability to
[29:29.150 --> 29:29.750]  come even close.
[29:30.610 --> 29:34.710]  Or I can bitch about how Jason Tatum is not getting playing time on the Olympic team.
[29:34.770 --> 29:36.570]  Like I know better than Steve Kerr.
[29:36.750 --> 29:37.110]  Yes.
[29:39.810 --> 29:43.990]  And Tyloo and all the and fucking Spoh and all those other coaches that are on the team.
[29:44.110 --> 29:51.010]  Yeah, there should be, you know, there's like the G League and like high end prospect
[29:51.010 --> 29:56.270]  leagues of like a feeding system for like college athletes or whatever to come into
[29:56.270 --> 30:00.190]  the pros or like to give people experience before they enter the pros.
[30:00.550 --> 30:01.950]  They should do that.
[30:02.710 --> 30:05.210]  But it's like a beer league.
[30:05.210 --> 30:07.650]  Like it is guys with normal jobs.
[30:07.870 --> 30:08.450]  It's a league.
[30:08.790 --> 30:14.850]  And the most hated player for incompetence of the league gets relegated to that league
[30:14.850 --> 30:22.330]  for the next season just to display how much better they are than any average person who
[30:22.330 --> 30:23.330]  plays the game a lot.
[30:23.390 --> 30:26.510]  Just like the athletic difference from the worst player.
[30:27.130 --> 30:28.430]  And that decides to shut everyone up.
[30:28.830 --> 30:29.070]  Yeah.
[30:29.310 --> 30:33.490]  Just like a bunch of guys that work in accounting that play hockey.
[30:34.090 --> 30:39.090]  But the most like incompetent, it'll be like a league wide vote of who is the shittiest
[30:39.090 --> 30:43.930]  player and they have to play in the rec league to be like, no, you guys, you have no idea.
[30:44.190 --> 30:45.270]  There are levels to this game.
[30:45.270 --> 30:46.570]  They just push everyone to shit in.
[30:46.870 --> 30:47.190]  Yeah.
[30:48.090 --> 30:49.210]  40 goals a game.
[30:49.450 --> 30:49.470]  That's great.
[30:51.150 --> 30:52.750]  That's relegation I could get behind.
[30:54.450 --> 30:56.410]  How's everybody doing on their Doberman count?
[30:56.530 --> 30:58.150]  Anybody catch any Dobermans lately?
[30:58.990 --> 30:59.770]  I haven't.
[30:59.830 --> 31:00.210]  You know what?
[31:00.550 --> 31:02.590]  I've been on top of my dog count, Geoff.
[31:02.590 --> 31:04.490]  Haven't been keeping track of Dobermans.
[31:04.810 --> 31:05.670]  I forgot about that.
[31:05.750 --> 31:07.490]  Have you talked about the new Slack channel?
[31:08.050 --> 31:08.810]  I don't think we have.
[31:09.090 --> 31:10.350]  Oh, the hot dog channel?
[31:10.890 --> 31:11.110]  Yeah.
[31:11.970 --> 31:13.270]  Well, first off, I've seen three.
[31:13.390 --> 31:15.150]  I've seen three Dobermans since we last uploaded.
[31:15.410 --> 31:18.410]  Two on the trail and one in a Whole Foods, which seemed weird to me,
[31:18.430 --> 31:20.030]  but I'm not going to tell a Doberman where he belongs.
[31:22.990 --> 31:23.930]  We're doing dogs.
[31:24.110 --> 31:25.650]  We talked about keeping track of dogs.
[31:25.750 --> 31:27.250]  So there's a Slack channel now.
[31:27.490 --> 31:30.590]  Whenever anybody eats a dog, just update that number.
[31:31.430 --> 31:35.930]  What's amazing is that we have a dedicated hot dog Slack channel,
[31:36.070 --> 31:39.790]  but you had a whole thing last night about dogs.
[31:40.090 --> 31:43.330]  You made like a dog ladder, but that wasn't in the dog Slack channel.
[31:43.430 --> 31:45.990]  Yeah, because I didn't want to muddy up the dog count.
[31:46.190 --> 31:48.430]  I wanted the dog count to remain as just numbers.
[31:48.810 --> 31:50.330]  It's not for conversation. It's just for counting.
[31:50.970 --> 31:52.750]  Yeah, I had that thought, Gavin.
[31:53.070 --> 31:57.230]  I evaluated, this is about the dogs, but you don't want to muddy up the dog channel.
[31:57.450 --> 31:59.070]  Yeah, Gavin, obviously.
[31:59.070 --> 32:00.870]  Come on, jeez.
[32:01.270 --> 32:01.990]  You say that, Eric.
[32:02.830 --> 32:03.850]  Do you agree?
[32:04.350 --> 32:05.370]  What's your opinion on this?
[32:05.570 --> 32:09.130]  I think the dog information could have been in there,
[32:09.290 --> 32:11.710]  but I'm fine as long as it exists.
[32:11.890 --> 32:13.550]  For here are your dog pictures.
[32:16.490 --> 32:20.990]  You were originally asking if there's multiple patties in a burger.
[32:21.490 --> 32:22.510]  It's still one burger.
[32:22.830 --> 32:26.290]  I had a Costco hot dog, and the Costco hot dog is huge.
[32:26.290 --> 32:27.250]  Yeah, it is.
[32:27.310 --> 32:28.750]  And so I was curious.
[32:29.970 --> 32:32.110]  That was perfect, Nick.
[32:32.310 --> 32:33.130]  That was really funny.
[32:34.830 --> 32:37.870]  You delivered that at the exact volume you needed to.
[32:39.330 --> 32:45.310]  It just seemed weird to me that or potentially odd that every hot dog counts the same.
[32:45.870 --> 32:50.330]  And so I looked into it and I guess the typical hot dog is like a one eighth of a pound.
[32:50.610 --> 32:53.630]  And the Costco hot dog is a quarter pound dog.
[32:53.630 --> 32:57.630]  So I was asking because I didn't I didn't really care one way or another.
[32:57.830 --> 33:02.630]  But does the size of the dog impact how many dogs are counted?
[33:03.090 --> 33:07.270]  So like if the Costco hot dog is to a normal dog,
[33:07.330 --> 33:10.010]  is it two dogs or is it just one dog?
[33:10.030 --> 33:11.790]  Because it's a singular hot dog that's big.
[33:11.970 --> 33:13.810]  And the answer is one dog.
[33:14.530 --> 33:18.450]  That's like saying if you had a plate of sliders, is it one burger?
[33:20.730 --> 33:23.370]  I don't know if that's what that's like, but I don't know.
[33:23.370 --> 33:26.790]  If you got tiny ones, it's it doesn't make it.
[33:26.990 --> 33:28.970]  It's if you have three small ones, you have three.
[33:29.450 --> 33:34.010]  If you if it's on you, if you decide to eat a bigger than normal hot dog, it's still a hot dog.
[33:34.130 --> 33:35.550]  That's that's phrasing behind.
[33:35.870 --> 33:37.050]  That makes more sense to me.
[33:38.570 --> 33:44.110]  So we're just talking about, well, what makes like what makes a burger burger?
[33:44.470 --> 33:46.030]  What makes a hot dog a hot dog?
[33:48.410 --> 33:52.230]  And it led to conversations about hot dog shapes
[33:52.230 --> 33:57.190]  as the premise was that as long as it's in a bun and there's meat,
[33:57.910 --> 34:01.890]  no amount beyond that makes it an additional dog.
[34:02.130 --> 34:07.530]  So if you have two hot dogs in one bun, that's still one dog because it's packaged as one thing.
[34:08.730 --> 34:16.430]  And so I drew some sketches of a hand hot dog, which is a dog down the bun normally,
[34:17.030 --> 34:20.950]  and then like four dogs sticking out the side of it.
[34:20.950 --> 34:22.370]  That you're adhesive.
[34:23.030 --> 34:24.270]  Yeah, with cheese.
[34:24.590 --> 34:28.150]  But no one's going to pick up one of those and think, oh, what a wonderful hot dog.
[34:28.370 --> 34:29.970]  They're not going to say that's one dog.
[34:31.030 --> 34:31.930]  That's what I'm saying.
[34:31.970 --> 34:35.890]  Based on the definition that we've set, that would be one hot dog.
[34:36.190 --> 34:38.350]  And then at that point, it looked like a ladder.
[34:38.530 --> 34:41.490]  Well, I would argue, though, that hot dogs differ from burgers,
[34:41.570 --> 34:43.510]  because if you have two patties in one burger, it's a burger.
[34:44.010 --> 34:48.010]  If you had two dogs in the bun, you could easily call that a double dog.
[34:48.270 --> 34:49.730]  I think you would say that was two.
[34:50.290 --> 34:53.750]  Have you ever had that or seen someone who has done that?
[34:53.930 --> 34:56.010]  We talked about it and just went, that's insane.
[34:56.350 --> 34:57.250]  A double dog?
[34:58.070 --> 35:01.070]  Yes, I mean, we're talking about the picture that he drew.
[35:01.150 --> 35:04.090]  Yeah, which looks like a ladder, by the way.
[35:04.130 --> 35:05.050]  It's a hot dog ladder.
[35:05.410 --> 35:06.230]  It is a hot dog ladder.
[35:06.310 --> 35:06.530]  Yeah.
[35:07.370 --> 35:11.230]  And the other one, have you ever had the mysterious two hot dogs, one bun?
[35:13.370 --> 35:15.010]  No, I don't think so.
[35:15.110 --> 35:18.230]  And that's what we were saying, is that like weird question,
[35:18.230 --> 35:19.930]  but I don't know that it exists.
[35:20.190 --> 35:22.150]  So it's really just sort of...
[35:22.150 --> 35:26.930]  Definitely exists and is very common to something that potentially no one has ever had.
[35:27.090 --> 35:30.870]  Yes, but Nick asked if a corn dog is a hot dog.
[35:30.990 --> 35:31.230]  Yeah.
[35:31.390 --> 35:31.730]  No.
[35:32.390 --> 35:32.650]  No.
[35:32.910 --> 35:33.310]  It's a corn dog.
[35:33.610 --> 35:33.970]  How not?
[35:34.150 --> 35:34.530]  It's a corn dog.
[35:35.210 --> 35:35.890]  It's a corn dog.
[35:36.310 --> 35:37.890]  It's a hot dog in a corn shell.
[35:38.610 --> 35:39.470]  That's not what it's called.
[35:39.510 --> 35:40.130]  It's called a corn dog.
[35:40.890 --> 35:42.950]  You keep saying corn shell.
[35:43.410 --> 35:46.150]  I don't... corn shell is such a weird way to put it.
[35:46.150 --> 35:50.530]  Listen, listen, all toads are frogs, but not all frogs are toads.
[35:50.750 --> 35:52.150]  Therefore, all hot dogs...
[35:53.010 --> 35:56.350]  Wait, all corn dogs are hot dogs, but not all hot dogs are corn dogs.
[35:56.590 --> 35:57.350]  Did you look it up?
[35:57.650 --> 35:59.930]  Did you see if all frogs are toads or whatever?
[36:00.930 --> 36:01.990]  Yeah, yeah, I'm right.
[36:02.290 --> 36:05.490]  Gavin, what I like in this too, I asked him, it's like,
[36:05.550 --> 36:10.510]  OK, so if you think it is like in a corn shell, when you see a turtle,
[36:10.810 --> 36:14.870]  are you just going like, oh, that's a lizard, but in like a hard shell?
[36:15.050 --> 36:15.590]  In a turtle shell.
[36:15.590 --> 36:16.690]  That's a hard shell lizard.
[36:17.070 --> 36:19.470]  Yeah, look at that. That lizard looks fucked up.
[36:20.130 --> 36:22.110]  What would you call a corn dog in a bun?
[36:23.530 --> 36:24.050]  It's a corn dog.
[36:24.490 --> 36:25.650]  Fucked up. Fair food.
[36:26.390 --> 36:27.330]  Yeah, fair food.
[36:30.090 --> 36:32.250]  That might be the only way I could eat a corn dog.
[36:32.290 --> 36:34.150]  No, I don't think it's still a corn dog.
[36:34.190 --> 36:34.910]  I couldn't eat it.
[36:35.310 --> 36:36.390]  Wait, you can't eat corn?
[36:36.470 --> 36:37.930]  What are you talking about? You can't eat a corn dog?
[36:38.450 --> 36:40.430]  You know that. It's been since the beginning of the whole thing.
[36:40.770 --> 36:42.690]  I don't remember that at all.
[36:42.810 --> 36:45.130]  I swore off corn dogs for the rest of my life.
[36:45.130 --> 36:46.310]  I decided I'd eaten enough.
[36:46.650 --> 36:47.870]  Yeah, you swore off.
[36:48.030 --> 36:50.810]  OK, I couldn't remember a bunch of corn dog updates.
[36:51.290 --> 36:53.690]  Yeah, I think most of the updates were, I still don't want one.
[36:53.970 --> 36:55.630]  Yeah, definitely.
[36:55.990 --> 36:59.110]  I've definitely had to like turn down a couple of corn dogs
[36:59.110 --> 37:01.090]  that were pretty sexy, if I'm being honest.
[37:01.230 --> 37:03.430]  But you wanted to fuck some corn dogs?
[37:03.450 --> 37:04.590]  Stay true to my ideals.
[37:06.110 --> 37:10.630]  I, uh, I'm looking at all of the places that I can order hot dogs from
[37:10.630 --> 37:14.690]  in my area right now and what additions they have to it.
[37:14.690 --> 37:16.290]  Order hot dogs. What?
[37:17.130 --> 37:17.610]  What do you mean?
[37:18.110 --> 37:19.550]  I just can't. I don't.
[37:19.770 --> 37:23.270]  What places like so hot like Sonic?
[37:23.450 --> 37:25.570]  We got a place called Big Wheel Burger.
[37:26.050 --> 37:29.590]  They got a hot dog and I'm looking at their additions right now.
[37:30.330 --> 37:36.310]  And it's stuff you'd expect like bacon, jalapeno, Monterey Jack cheese, fried onion.
[37:37.010 --> 37:39.650]  But you can also add a burger to the dog.
[37:39.930 --> 37:43.090]  There is no add a second dog to the hot dog.
[37:43.090 --> 37:45.650]  But there is an add a burger to the hot dog.
[37:45.670 --> 37:47.890]  But you're not adding it to the hot dog, surely.
[37:48.070 --> 37:51.730]  Add a chicken patty to the hot dog. There's no add a hot dog.
[37:51.990 --> 37:53.490]  It's just going to come with it, though.
[37:54.130 --> 37:54.470]  What do you mean?
[37:54.730 --> 37:57.130]  Are you saying it's going to end up in the bun or on it?
[37:57.610 --> 38:00.070]  Do you want me to order it right now and see what shows up?
[38:00.330 --> 38:00.910]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:02.030 --> 38:05.070]  I can't fucking believe how much hot dogs keep coming up.
[38:05.210 --> 38:07.310]  I have, you guys don't know this because why would you?
[38:07.850 --> 38:12.490]  In the last week, I've recorded two entire episodes on So Alright about hot dogs.
[38:12.490 --> 38:17.310]  I had so much hot dog research and so many hot dog facts.
[38:17.450 --> 38:19.170]  I had to do a second episode.
[38:20.030 --> 38:24.490]  You have a podcast that could be about literally anything and you've hit hot dogs twice.
[38:25.230 --> 38:27.450]  Two weeks in a row I've hit hot dogs, yeah.
[38:28.930 --> 38:30.370]  I turned one into Nick already.
[38:30.670 --> 38:31.670]  Were they good episodes?
[38:32.470 --> 38:34.410]  I think they're as good as this.
[38:35.270 --> 38:37.690]  I think corn dogs are deeply flawed.
[38:38.470 --> 38:38.810]  Yeah.
[38:38.810 --> 38:39.370]  Hot dogs.
[38:41.090 --> 38:45.690]  Because when you dip, are you meant to drizzle stuff on or dip them in stuff?
[38:46.110 --> 38:46.370]  Either.
[38:46.590 --> 38:46.830]  Both.
[38:47.490 --> 38:52.150]  I just feel like if I have to open my mouth really wide and I've got mustard on the end of a corn dog,
[38:52.790 --> 38:58.170]  it's just overpowering mustard all over my tongue first and I feel like that's a flaw.
[38:59.110 --> 39:00.730]  Whereas if you have it hot dog format,
[39:01.150 --> 39:04.510]  you don't get everything you dipped as the first thing that hits your mouth.
[39:05.070 --> 39:07.810]  Now, I just posted a picture of a hot dog that I ate
[39:08.330 --> 39:10.850]  and I just want to get your opinion on that.
[39:10.950 --> 39:14.670]  Because I get what you're saying but this is so like loaded up
[39:14.670 --> 39:18.450]  that I don't know that I tasted the hot dog at all.
[39:18.810 --> 39:19.910]  You know what I mean?
[39:20.850 --> 39:21.610]  What is that?
[39:22.010 --> 39:22.570]  Fritos?
[39:23.110 --> 39:23.830]  Sour cream?
[39:24.350 --> 39:29.770]  It's a chili cheese hot dog with Fritos, jalapenos, and sour cream.
[39:30.610 --> 39:30.850]  That?
[39:31.110 --> 39:36.630]  So there's chili cheese in there and then like all this other stuff.
[39:36.630 --> 39:37.610]  And it's just...
[39:38.150 --> 39:39.870]  Looks like you had a Pearl Snap back there too.
[39:40.310 --> 39:42.450]  Yeah, that was Jordan. I was drinking Lone Star.
[39:42.730 --> 39:44.390]  Dude, Pearl Snap is such a good fucking beer.
[39:45.330 --> 39:49.430]  I went to this bar and there was a sign on the door that said,
[39:50.330 --> 39:52.290]  please do not let the cat inside.
[39:52.810 --> 39:59.090]  And the cat ran inside immediately and sat on the bar and kept sniffing this woman's cooers.
[40:03.350 --> 40:06.290]  It's just like, he looks so cool.
[40:06.630 --> 40:08.330]  That's just the bar cat. He's awesome.
[40:08.470 --> 40:10.070]  And they have a little framed picture of him right there too.
[40:10.490 --> 40:11.490]  How's the hot dog? Was it good?
[40:12.770 --> 40:14.010]  The hot dog was fucking great.
[40:14.090 --> 40:17.930]  I had one and then I sat down, I drank, like I was having a beer and eating the dog.
[40:18.010 --> 40:19.930]  And then I sat there for five minutes and I went,
[40:20.910 --> 40:22.450]  fuck, I have to get another one.
[40:22.630 --> 40:23.790]  I could have eaten...
[40:23.790 --> 40:25.550]  I could have eaten probably four or five.
[40:25.910 --> 40:27.030]  I was hoping...
[40:27.030 --> 40:28.850]  I went to Sam's Club yesterday with Emily.
[40:29.150 --> 40:31.470]  She had to pick up some stuff for her work.
[40:31.750 --> 40:35.070]  And I thought, oh fuck, I always hear about the Costco hot dogs.
[40:35.150 --> 40:36.290]  I'm gonna try Sam's Club hot dog.
[40:37.710 --> 40:39.570]  And I wish I hadn't done that.
[40:39.970 --> 40:41.790]  Yeah, it's so rare.
[40:42.030 --> 40:44.030]  Yeah, it's so rare you get a bad hot dog.
[40:44.090 --> 40:46.550]  But when you do, it's the saddest fucking thing on Earth.
[40:46.990 --> 40:47.030]  Oh no!
[40:47.330 --> 40:47.830]  What was it?
[40:48.350 --> 40:51.310]  Just an all beef, like, hot dog, like you would expect.
[40:51.450 --> 40:52.230]  Normal ass hot dog.
[40:52.690 --> 40:56.350]  It just was, I think, had been out for a couple of years or something.
[40:56.490 --> 40:57.410]  It just wasn't good.
[40:57.530 --> 40:57.930]  I don't know.
[40:58.210 --> 40:58.910]  It just didn't taste good.
[40:59.550 --> 41:00.530]  Bread tasted old.
[41:00.650 --> 41:01.670]  Just wasn't good.
[41:01.710 --> 41:04.370]  It wasn't anything like you'd want it to be.
[41:04.570 --> 41:05.670]  Yeah, it was a real bummer.
[41:06.310 --> 41:06.650]  Damn.
[41:07.810 --> 41:12.890]  We went to Costco the other day, got a Costco hot dog, and that was so good.
[41:13.070 --> 41:20.030]  But the worst thing about the Costco food court, that soda selection is fucking out of control.
[41:20.450 --> 41:23.510]  That is the dumbest fucking soda selection I've ever seen.
[41:23.930 --> 41:24.910]  It doesn't make any sense.
[41:24.910 --> 41:25.330]  What's on there?
[41:25.690 --> 41:32.870]  It's Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Starry, some kind of tea, some other kind of tea.
[41:33.330 --> 41:34.090]  That's it.
[41:34.410 --> 41:35.330]  So no Coke for you.
[41:35.670 --> 41:37.950]  You had me at Diet Pepsi and Starry.
[41:38.330 --> 41:41.970]  Dude, I drank a Pepsi because I couldn't remember the last time I had a Pepsi.
[41:42.190 --> 41:44.610]  It tasted like doing yard work with my dad.
[41:44.990 --> 41:48.390]  It was like, oh no, that's why I don't drink this shit.
[41:49.770 --> 41:51.110]  It was awful.
[41:51.570 --> 41:52.470]  It was so sad.
[41:53.950 --> 41:54.290]  Yuck.
[41:55.010 --> 41:55.810]  Oh, man.
[41:56.030 --> 42:04.150]  Gavin, I had a thought about you yesterday that I wanted to talk to you about, if you don't mind.
[42:04.150 --> 42:06.530]  Was this before or after we spoke on the telephone?
[42:08.070 --> 42:09.490]  Did you guys speak on the phone?
[42:09.610 --> 42:10.430]  Did you guys talk on the phone?
[42:11.030 --> 42:11.890]  It was after.
[42:12.210 --> 42:12.510]  Okay.
[42:13.110 --> 42:16.210]  It was, I was, I was, uh, I was talking to you.
[42:16.250 --> 42:16.790]  I was thinking about it.
[42:16.910 --> 42:18.050]  I was thinking about you in bed last night.
[42:19.450 --> 42:20.230]  Not like that.
[42:20.390 --> 42:20.830]  Not like that.
[42:20.850 --> 42:21.450]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:21.870 --> 42:23.050]  You know that documentary?
[42:23.490 --> 42:31.370]  Do you know that documentary about that guy who was arrested for murder in L.A.
[42:31.370 --> 42:34.570]  And his alibi was that he was at a Dodgers game.
[42:34.650 --> 42:39.050]  And then it just so happened to be that they were filming an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[42:39.450 --> 42:42.470]  And so they were able to get the guy off because they filmed him.
[42:42.970 --> 42:45.650]  I was thinking about how much you've filmed in your life.
[42:46.370 --> 42:47.890]  Oh, how many alibis I've got?
[42:48.310 --> 42:52.190]  I wonder how many crimes you could solve.
[42:52.550 --> 42:54.150]  How many alibis?
[42:54.310 --> 42:56.630]  How many, how many wrongs you could write?
[42:57.230 --> 43:00.090]  How many, how much justice could be dispensed?
[43:00.090 --> 43:08.350]  Just based on the 10 billion hours of phone footage and, you know, dicking around footage you have.
[43:08.530 --> 43:11.870]  I mean, I could take maybe a year out of my life to try and watch it all,
[43:12.270 --> 43:13.190]  see what I can come up with.
[43:13.890 --> 43:17.610]  I'm sure, I guarantee you, there's some, I guarantee you,
[43:17.790 --> 43:21.110]  you caught, you inadvertently caught something of significance on camera
[43:21.110 --> 43:24.630]  that's not significant to you and it'll probably never be realized,
[43:24.790 --> 43:28.770]  but that could have altered the course of something if it had been discovered.
[43:29.470 --> 43:30.190]  Guarantee you.
[43:30.610 --> 43:34.030]  We had, we had a little bit when, uh, I'd inadvertently filmed a serial number
[43:34.030 --> 43:36.050]  to something at work once that we needed. Do you remember?
[43:37.790 --> 43:38.590]  I don't.
[43:40.630 --> 43:41.810]  Is that something you can't talk about?
[43:42.050 --> 43:43.570]  Probably. I mean, someone went missing.
[43:44.310 --> 43:45.790]  Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:49.190 --> 43:54.130]  Yeah, I felt like I was like going through my evidence and I had some.
[43:54.690 --> 43:59.990]  Yeah, I would feel really bad because I assume I'm not going to watch a lot of this stuff until
[44:00.390 --> 44:05.750]  I'm elderly. I'll be like, I remember my youth, my past, and I'll be like, oh,
[44:06.310 --> 44:09.130]  that guy's already been put to death. Oh, shit.
[44:09.330 --> 44:09.830]  Oh, no.
[44:10.470 --> 44:10.870]  Jesus.
[44:11.310 --> 44:12.750]  That's the kind of stuff I'm going to find probably.
[44:13.470 --> 44:14.230]  Yeah, that's a shame.
[44:14.570 --> 44:15.930]  Oh, like he died yesterday.
[44:17.870 --> 44:20.870]  20 years and I still didn't get it in time. Oh God.
[44:21.570 --> 44:23.050]  I, uh, yeah, that would be sad.
[44:23.050 --> 44:24.230]  Maybe don't look.
[44:24.930 --> 44:27.490]  Nick put up, Nick put up a poll on Twitter.
[44:28.290 --> 44:28.970]  Just now?
[44:29.570 --> 44:32.590]  Is a corn dog a hot dog is the poll that Nick just put up.
[44:33.090 --> 44:35.270]  OK, and what are the standards?
[44:35.410 --> 44:41.190]  I just, I just commented because when I went to tap on the tweet to see what happened,
[44:41.350 --> 44:45.290]  like, how are people voting? I hit yes. I voted yes.
[44:46.430 --> 44:49.370]  I meant no. So take one vote from yes and put it in no.
[44:49.490 --> 44:50.550]  All right, I'll do that at the end.
[44:51.090 --> 44:52.710]  When I hit no, it says sign in.
[44:54.030 --> 44:57.430]  Yeah, same. I'll never know the answer to that fucking poll
[44:57.430 --> 44:59.490]  because I'll never be able to log into Twitter again.
[44:59.630 --> 45:00.470]  What's it at currently?
[45:01.550 --> 45:05.350]  Uh, 57% yes, 43% no.
[45:06.370 --> 45:10.990]  But we have 23 hours and 53 minutes before, you know, there's time.
[45:11.210 --> 45:16.660]  Yeah, then I'm right.
[45:16.740 --> 45:16.960]  Great.
[45:18.580 --> 45:24.100]  Do you, uh, maybe it's because I just moved, but at what point in your life,
[45:24.100 --> 45:27.960]  like you were saying, you know, you assume you won't look at all that footage until you're
[45:27.960 --> 45:30.620]  elderly. There's going to be a point in your life when you just throw it away.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.760]  How long do you think it's going to be before you do that?
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.380]  Like, get rid of all the footage?
[45:35.020 --> 45:37.480]  Yeah, where you're just like, you're so far removed from it,
[45:37.880 --> 45:41.860]  or the technology is so old, it would be so annoying to even pull it up.
[45:42.000 --> 45:43.500]  You're just like, why the fuck should I watch a VHS?
[45:44.060 --> 45:47.320]  Yeah, I'm 68 years old. I haven't thought about slow-mo guys in 28 years.
[45:47.380 --> 45:48.780]  Why the fuck would I care about, you know what I mean?
[45:48.820 --> 45:51.300]  Or like, after what Dan did to me, there's no way, you know?
[45:51.620 --> 45:53.820]  Hunting around for something that plays like an MOV.
[45:53.820 --> 45:55.720]  I'm like, oh, I remember this file type, geez.
[45:56.060 --> 45:57.220]  I was thinking about when I was moving.
[45:57.380 --> 46:00.740]  I have a, like, I hold on to all my cell phones for some reason,
[46:00.780 --> 46:01.740]  instead of trading them in.
[46:02.020 --> 46:03.640]  And just because I always feel like there's a photo or something
[46:03.640 --> 46:04.860]  that didn't get transferred to the cloud,
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.880]  or there's going to be some reason I would need to go back to it.
[46:07.900 --> 46:09.940]  So I have like every iPhone I've ever had,
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.600]  and I just bring them from house to house.
[46:12.720 --> 46:14.980]  And at some point, they're going in a landfill, right?
[46:15.040 --> 46:20.180]  Because I wouldn't even, there's no way I'm ever going to pull out my iPhone 4
[46:20.180 --> 46:22.400]  to pull something out or to try to find something.
[46:22.500 --> 46:23.180]  I'm just not.
[46:23.180 --> 46:24.200]  I think I will.
[46:24.600 --> 46:27.440]  You know, I go through the hassle of moving it and putting it in a box,
[46:27.580 --> 46:28.420]  but I'm not.
[46:28.600 --> 46:30.500]  So why don't I just get rid of it now?
[46:30.580 --> 46:31.380]  But I can't.
[46:31.620 --> 46:35.900]  I think they'll be useful for you if you need to come up with fake alibis.
[46:36.880 --> 46:38.120]  Like if you, if someone's like,
[46:38.180 --> 46:41.040]  where were you on the evening of whatever, 2014?
[46:41.340 --> 46:45.260]  You can quickly take a picture of you holding an iPhone 4
[46:45.260 --> 46:46.380]  and be like, oh, here I was.
[46:48.420 --> 46:50.860]  Bit of Photoshop on the, on the hair and that.
[46:51.500 --> 46:53.180]  Pay no attention to how none of the tattoos match.
[46:53.580 --> 46:56.780]  You're wearing the same shirt that you're wearing right now.
[46:57.040 --> 46:57.940]  Wow, what a coincidence.
[46:58.180 --> 46:59.540]  2014, huh? That's pretty crazy.
[46:59.780 --> 47:01.420]  The same shirt that you're talking to the FBI.
[47:04.620 --> 47:07.560]  It's a 28 megapixel photo.
[47:07.840 --> 47:09.080]  Oh, see? Check it out.
[47:09.120 --> 47:11.220]  Here's me holding an iPhone 4.
[47:12.680 --> 47:16.060]  I just am suddenly very aware of everything that I own
[47:16.060 --> 47:18.000]  because everything that I own is in the same house
[47:18.000 --> 47:19.620]  because I got rid of storage shed and everything.
[47:19.620 --> 47:22.380]  And you just start to think about the stuff you're holding on to
[47:22.380 --> 47:23.500]  because you think matters.
[47:23.940 --> 47:26.360]  And I just did a round of, uh,
[47:27.180 --> 47:29.920]  like cleaning out old documents that I had been saving.
[47:30.260 --> 47:33.420]  I had pay stubs that I had saved
[47:33.420 --> 47:36.660]  from when I was in journalism school in the army.
[47:37.400 --> 47:38.460]  Holy shit.
[47:38.640 --> 47:39.820]  Do you think the IRS might need them?
[47:40.320 --> 47:41.120]  Yeah, just in case.
[47:41.400 --> 47:48.580]  I found, I had every tax return from 1994 until this year I had saved.
[47:48.580 --> 47:52.200]  And so I had to go and like, I realized I read,
[47:52.260 --> 47:53.700]  I read about you only need to save like seven years,
[47:53.800 --> 47:56.340]  but I just, I had been carrying all that stuff around for so long,
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.180]  not even thinking about it.
[47:57.240 --> 48:00.980]  You know, a few years ago, I realized that I was hoarding
[48:00.980 --> 48:04.140]  all the little baggies of extra bolts and like an Allen wrench
[48:04.140 --> 48:06.000]  for every single piece of furniture I bought.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.380]  And now the first thing I do when I finish building furniture
[48:09.380 --> 48:11.200]  is throw every other thing away.
[48:11.760 --> 48:12.120]  Hell yes.
[48:12.520 --> 48:17.240]  If I, if for whatever reason I need it, I'm happy to try and figure it out,
[48:17.240 --> 48:18.780]  finding the exact thing I need on the internet,
[48:19.160 --> 48:21.780]  because that to me is cheaper time-wise
[48:21.780 --> 48:27.060]  than dealing with mounds of Allen wrenches and washers and screws and shit.
[48:27.340 --> 48:29.820]  I don't know why I was ever thinking I would use them for.
[48:30.080 --> 48:34.900]  The fucking universe puts a new Allen wrench in your hand at least every three days.
[48:35.700 --> 48:36.120]  Yeah.
[48:36.340 --> 48:37.500]  It's insane. They're everywhere.
[48:37.700 --> 48:39.240]  And they're all the exact same size.
[48:39.360 --> 48:42.320]  So you end up like, oh, I've got this bolt I need to put in.
[48:42.340 --> 48:44.640]  Let me try and see if my 16 Allen wrenches...
[48:44.640 --> 48:45.980]  Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[48:45.980 --> 48:46.420]  They're all the same.
[48:46.420 --> 48:47.520]  They're all the wrong size.
[48:50.500 --> 48:57.320]  Yeah, maybe every age that I turn that ends in a zero, I'll have a big old clear out.
[48:57.860 --> 48:58.800]  I think you should.
[48:59.220 --> 49:01.380]  I think it's probably good for you.
[49:01.980 --> 49:05.640]  You don't realize how much stuff you're holding onto for how long, you know?
[49:06.060 --> 49:10.320]  It's just like, I had like all the documents from when I bought my first house,
[49:10.340 --> 49:11.200]  which is cool.
[49:11.440 --> 49:12.680]  That seems important to me.
[49:12.700 --> 49:16.160]  And I thought briefly, I was like, well, should I hold onto this as like a record?
[49:16.540 --> 49:21.860]  But I sold that house in, you know, whatever, 2011 or something, 2012.
[49:22.220 --> 49:26.320]  Why do I need a record of owning a house from 2005 until 2012?
[49:26.780 --> 49:27.340]  Like, what is that?
[49:27.420 --> 49:28.920]  What purpose is that going to ever...
[49:28.920 --> 49:30.540]  What practical purpose could that ever serve?
[49:30.660 --> 49:32.200]  The only thing I could even come up with is like,
[49:32.440 --> 49:34.760]  maybe someday somebody in the future could say,
[49:34.980 --> 49:35.780]  no, you didn't.
[49:35.880 --> 49:38.420]  And I could go, here's the deed, you know?
[49:38.760 --> 49:39.540]  But who am I?
[49:39.620 --> 49:40.200]  Who do I...
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.260]  Who is that person?
[49:41.340 --> 49:43.640]  And why would I want to prove them wrong, you know?
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.960]  And how inconvenient would it actually be if you didn't have that?
[49:47.660 --> 49:48.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:49.400 --> 49:54.700]  I feel like the biggest change for me moving straight from a house that my parents lived in
[49:54.700 --> 49:59.480]  to a house that I owned by myself was that pretty much growing up,
[49:59.560 --> 50:02.660]  if I put something down, it would get cleared up at some point.
[50:02.700 --> 50:04.280]  Like if I was drinking out of a glass of water,
[50:04.720 --> 50:06.580]  I popped it down, came back to it 20 minutes later,
[50:06.580 --> 50:08.680]  it's already been put in the dishwasher or something.
[50:08.740 --> 50:12.580]  I'm like, oh, now it's at the point where like, I'll move into a house.
[50:12.580 --> 50:13.600]  I did it with this one.
[50:14.040 --> 50:15.700]  And I was putting stuff in the cabinets.
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.300]  And one of them, I needed more space.
[50:18.360 --> 50:22.000]  So I took one of the shelves out and I just lent it against a wall in the kitchen.
[50:22.260 --> 50:25.160]  And then literally two years later, I was like,
[50:25.700 --> 50:28.060]  wow, that really hasn't... I should put that somewhere else.
[50:28.300 --> 50:32.080]  Like I just, I can put stuff down and then it literally doesn't move.
[50:32.120 --> 50:34.820]  It just gets caked in dust because there's no one to clear up.
[50:35.420 --> 50:36.500]  It's just such a weird feeling.
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.800]  It's a weird way to look at time.
[50:38.880 --> 50:41.780]  I'm just like, I put that down probably 700 days ago.
[50:41.780 --> 50:44.780]  And it sat there undisturbed for 700 days
[50:44.780 --> 50:48.460]  and would sit there for another 700 days if I didn't do something about it.
[50:48.600 --> 50:51.820]  When I moved out of the house that I was in for that,
[50:52.040 --> 50:54.040]  I don't know, five and a half years or whatever I was in,
[50:55.180 --> 50:58.820]  I found through the house, all these little projects that I had started,
[50:58.900 --> 51:02.300]  like in a corner of my closet, like, oh, I started to rearrange this.
[51:02.380 --> 51:04.640]  And then I just never got to it.
[51:04.660 --> 51:05.400]  When did I do that?
[51:05.440 --> 51:07.520]  And you're like, oh, fuck, I did that in 2019.
[51:07.960 --> 51:11.920]  So I just ignored that little corner for four years, I guess.
[51:12.820 --> 51:13.180]  Wow.
[51:13.320 --> 51:17.860]  Yeah, I finally, I think last year I got rid of my last, like, pandemic pile of shit.
[51:18.880 --> 51:21.920]  I think I was, it was like a pile of stuff I made when I was
[51:21.920 --> 51:23.620]  rearranging my stuff to work from home.
[51:23.700 --> 51:27.340]  And I was like, oh, it's all just been there for years.
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.380]  It feels icky to me.
[51:28.540 --> 51:30.460]  I have to, I have to move stuff around.
[51:30.500 --> 51:31.760]  Otherwise I get weirded out by it.
[51:32.360 --> 51:37.340]  It's like we, we did, this morning we played Mount Your Friends.
[51:37.660 --> 51:39.060]  We did a gameplay in it.
[51:39.160 --> 51:43.600]  And we played it on Steam, but they recommend you play with a controller.
[51:43.780 --> 51:46.220]  And I had had a controller hooked up to my Xbox,
[51:46.940 --> 51:48.640]  or an Xbox controller hooked up to my PC,
[51:48.800 --> 51:53.500]  since I was recording Achievement Hunter videos in my office at my old house.
[51:53.980 --> 51:56.780]  And I was having trouble with a connection one day.
[51:56.840 --> 51:58.760]  And I just got mad and I unplugged the dongle.
[51:58.800 --> 52:01.500]  And I threw it in a little box that was next to my desk.
[52:01.920 --> 52:03.580]  And it sat in that box.
[52:03.660 --> 52:05.760]  That would have been 2019, maybe.
[52:06.120 --> 52:09.520]  It sat in that box until yesterday when I realized,
[52:09.660 --> 52:12.460]  oh, I have that and I could play on a controller again.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.880]  And I went into my garage and I found where it was.
[52:14.940 --> 52:15.660]  And I plugged it back in.
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.980]  Like, I just had a thing that worked great that I just didn't use for four years.
[52:21.060 --> 52:22.120]  Because I just didn't think about it.
[52:22.400 --> 52:22.640]  You know?
[52:23.160 --> 52:25.080]  I've never lived in a house for very long.
[52:25.160 --> 52:29.840]  I think the longest I ever lived in the same place was maybe seven years or something.
[52:29.840 --> 52:35.200]  But I'm always fascinated by the people who grow up in a house and then they move out,
[52:35.280 --> 52:35.840]  get their own house.
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.520]  But then they can still go back to their childhood house if their parents didn't move.
[52:39.700 --> 52:43.940]  And I think that'd be such a half cool, but half disturbing feeling.
[52:44.220 --> 52:47.320]  To be like, oh, that's where I took a shit for the first time.
[52:47.820 --> 52:49.920]  I always think it's weird when you like...
[52:49.920 --> 52:51.280]  I mean, it's kind of cool.
[52:51.420 --> 52:52.300]  I guess it's not weird.
[52:52.460 --> 52:54.940]  But it's cool because that's kind of the whole idea of, like,
[52:56.060 --> 52:59.720]  creating generational wealth is usually through property and passing property down.
[52:59.720 --> 53:05.700]  I think it's weird to live as a grown up and raise a family in the house you were raised in.
[53:07.580 --> 53:12.480]  My uncle lived in my grandma's house when she moved in with my aunt at some point.
[53:13.020 --> 53:15.980]  And he was in his 50s living in the house that he was raised in.
[53:16.180 --> 53:19.520]  It's cool because there's a lineage and a familiarity there,
[53:19.640 --> 53:24.400]  but it also must be a little weird and gotta be stifling in some way, I would imagine.
[53:24.560 --> 53:24.880]  I don't know.
[53:25.080 --> 53:27.320]  I bet it's cool when you're like, where did I put that thing?
[53:27.320 --> 53:31.080]  Instead of being like, I wonder which move I lost that during.
[53:35.120 --> 53:36.280]  So Andrew's...
[53:37.860 --> 53:38.840]  Andrew's busy.
[53:40.440 --> 53:42.460]  Andrew's dealing with his anus, I think.
[53:42.900 --> 53:48.140]  Yeah, he's been in a fight for his life for 15 minutes now.
[53:48.300 --> 53:53.620]  However, however, he did order the hot dog burger chicken.
[53:54.260 --> 53:55.240]  I don't know.
[53:55.460 --> 53:59.040]  I don't know what it means, but he's going to reveal it on the next episode.
[54:01.000 --> 54:02.700]  Nick said he didn't mute his Discord.
[54:02.900 --> 54:03.860]  That sounds terrible, Nick.
[54:06.740 --> 54:07.820]  He said, I'll read it.
[54:07.900 --> 54:09.180]  He said, I might not make it back.
[54:09.260 --> 54:10.620]  My body just won't quit.
[54:13.360 --> 54:16.860]  So he said he'll reveal the hamburger dog chicken thing next episode.
[54:17.520 --> 54:20.260]  If you wondered why Gavin and I suddenly were having an in-depth conversation
[54:20.260 --> 54:22.020]  just between the two of us for about 15 minutes.
[54:23.680 --> 54:24.860]  That's what's been going on.
[54:25.040 --> 54:27.400]  That was us professionally vamping.
[54:27.400 --> 54:32.200]  I like the idea of you giving all your old iPhones to Millie
[54:32.200 --> 54:34.060]  and telling her to give them to her kids.
[54:35.940 --> 54:39.100]  These are your grandpa's phones.
[54:40.500 --> 54:42.460]  He'd leave those two are in the will.
[54:42.980 --> 54:43.660]  What the fuck?
[54:43.960 --> 54:45.240]  Good luck finding a connector.
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.040]  It's a fucking iPhone 3?
[54:48.040 --> 54:50.840]  All the fucking screens are busted on all of them.
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.080]  Every fucking one of them.
[54:54.340 --> 54:55.120]  Bastard shit.
[54:55.520 --> 54:57.680]  Yeah, it's at that point now where at this time of the year,
[54:57.780 --> 54:59.180]  I don't know if everyone else deals with this,
[54:59.480 --> 55:01.600]  where my shitty phone won't last a day.
[55:02.200 --> 55:02.820]  Do you have that?
[55:03.340 --> 55:03.540]  No.
[55:03.600 --> 55:03.900]  Oh, yeah.
[55:04.020 --> 55:05.240]  No, I'm okay right now.
[55:05.460 --> 55:05.700]  Not really.
[55:05.960 --> 55:07.000]  You can get all the way to the evening?
[55:07.480 --> 55:07.620]  Yeah.
[55:07.700 --> 55:07.880]  Uh-huh.
[55:10.440 --> 55:12.400]  When I get into bed at night,
[55:12.540 --> 55:16.020]  I usually am sitting around like 18 to 24% battery.
[55:16.300 --> 55:16.560]  Yeah.
[55:16.840 --> 55:17.280]  Right now.
[55:17.280 --> 55:17.760]  Huh.
[55:19.580 --> 55:21.080]  But I'm not on my phone all the time.
[55:21.120 --> 55:24.200]  Like, I'm on this fucking computer more than anything anymore these days.
[55:24.380 --> 55:25.080]  Yeah, I'm not doing stuff.
[55:25.140 --> 55:26.780]  I listen to stuff from the phone quite a lot, though.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.500]  It's like Bluetooth playing something.
[55:29.200 --> 55:30.760]  No, I'm like that, Gavin.
[55:30.840 --> 55:33.600]  But also, like, there's a lot of quick work and stuff.
[55:35.080 --> 55:39.560]  Update things or whatever, social posts, whatever that I do from my phone.
[55:39.560 --> 55:42.480]  So I get a lot of work done from my phone, which is nice.
[55:42.500 --> 55:44.120]  But I don't know.
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.580]  I got that whatever the newest good iPhone is.
[55:47.680 --> 55:48.660]  And it's like, it's fine.
[55:48.680 --> 55:50.900]  But the battery life is only like medium good.
[55:51.320 --> 55:52.040]  I think it's OK.
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.080]  Dude, the best purchase I've made in the last like four years is Henry.
[55:58.280 --> 56:01.840]  When he was near the nearing the end, he was incontinent.
[56:02.060 --> 56:03.240]  He pissed.
[56:03.320 --> 56:03.960]  I don't know if you guys remember this.
[56:04.020 --> 56:06.960]  He pissed all over my laptop and destroyed it.
[56:06.980 --> 56:10.160]  And I had to buy a new laptop and I was bummed about it.
[56:10.180 --> 56:12.480]  So I bought the cheapest MacBook Air you can buy.
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.940]  A $600 MacBook Air has been the best fucking computer I've ever had.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.040]  And it has the most amazing battery life that talk about like shitty iPhone battery life.
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.280]  My MacBook Air is the opposite of that.
[56:24.300 --> 56:26.900]  That thing is fucking wild how long that battery lasts.
[56:27.300 --> 56:29.200]  And I end up because it's so small and easy to use.
[56:29.320 --> 56:31.500]  I think I use it where I would use my phone a lot.
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.000]  Like if I'm going to go to a coffee shop or something,
[56:33.100 --> 56:35.860]  it's just easy to bring that instead of like trying to work on my phone.
[56:36.160 --> 56:38.340]  So that's probably why I use a little less phone.
[56:38.860 --> 56:40.740]  Yeah, that definitely makes sense for sure.
[56:40.740 --> 56:42.720]  I hate doing any work on my phone.
[56:43.700 --> 56:46.320]  Oh, yeah, I don't. I don't like it, but I don't.
[56:46.460 --> 56:49.420]  I don't want to go. I hate spending all day in my office.
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.000]  I'll go insane. I have to be in a different room. I just have to.
[56:53.260 --> 56:57.160]  Have you thought about putting your computer in a different room and using it from another room?
[56:59.220 --> 57:01.640]  What? Moving my computer? Like my PC?
[57:03.120 --> 57:06.840]  You want me to unplug and re-hook up my PC in a different room?
[57:07.720 --> 57:08.360]  Bit of variety?
[57:08.360 --> 57:09.000]  Yeah.
[57:09.540 --> 57:11.400]  That, no, I don't consider doing that.
[57:11.740 --> 57:14.540]  If you're asking if that's if I thought about doing it, no.
[57:14.900 --> 57:15.440]  Not yet.
[57:16.280 --> 57:16.940]  Good to know.
[57:17.700 --> 57:20.980]  I think I'd probably just buy a laptop if I had to do that.
[57:21.440 --> 57:23.660]  Andrew said, I got a hot mic and explosive anus.
[57:24.360 --> 57:25.080]  Oh, no.
[57:25.340 --> 57:27.840]  It's very likely that Vince Vaughn is to be blamed.
[57:28.300 --> 57:30.240]  What is he talking about?
[57:30.440 --> 57:33.680]  Did he watch a Vince Vaughn movie and think, oh, I'm going to have that for dinner?
[57:33.960 --> 57:34.520]  And then...
[57:34.520 --> 57:35.800]  Do you think he drank his slushie?
[57:36.480 --> 57:36.820]  Oh.
[57:37.220 --> 57:37.920]  Well, I don't know.
[57:38.120 --> 57:39.860]  A lot of people have pointed this out too, Eric.
[57:40.200 --> 57:43.900]  You were very protective over us blowing a balloon up in each other's mouths.
[57:44.500 --> 57:47.240]  But you were all for Andrew sucking down a four month old slushie.
[57:47.240 --> 57:48.640]  No, just taking a sip.
[57:49.680 --> 57:49.960]  Right.
[57:52.160 --> 57:53.040]  I'm with you, Gav.
[57:53.080 --> 57:53.900]  I think there's something there.
[57:53.980 --> 57:55.980]  I think Eric might secretly be trying to kill Andrew.
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.160]  No, not at all.
[57:57.340 --> 58:01.220]  I just, I just think if he thinks it's good, then who am I to say it's not?
[58:01.500 --> 58:02.320]  Well, let me ask you this then.
[58:02.340 --> 58:04.060]  Can I blow up a balloon in Andrew's mouth?
[58:04.660 --> 58:05.100]  No.
[58:05.540 --> 58:09.800]  Do you think if one of us dies, the rest of us will become a little more powerful?
[58:10.780 --> 58:11.220]  No.
[58:11.380 --> 58:13.880]  Like, we'll absorb their power and abilities and talent?
[58:14.160 --> 58:14.200]  Yeah.
[58:14.220 --> 58:16.400]  Yeah, like Jet Li in The One? I don't think so.
[58:16.560 --> 58:18.680]  Except if Andrew dies, we'll just all get his anus.
[58:18.920 --> 58:20.900]  We all have exploding anus.
[58:21.160 --> 58:22.140]  I already have his anus.
[58:22.940 --> 58:25.400]  I got enough anus over here. I don't need his.
[58:27.460 --> 58:29.660]  Do you think, who's got the best anus of the group?
[58:30.340 --> 58:30.720]  Nick.
[58:30.720 --> 58:31.400]  Yeah, probably.
[58:31.840 --> 58:34.820]  I eat pretty poorly.
[58:36.380 --> 58:38.540]  Like, it's always Nick. Like, who can run the fastest?
[58:39.000 --> 58:39.620]  Who's got the best anus?
[58:39.620 --> 58:43.080]  Nick's the fastest. Yeah, he's the fastest. He's got the best ass, you know?
[58:43.200 --> 58:44.480]  It's just classic Nick stuff.
[58:44.520 --> 58:45.700]  Yeah, dude. I'm healthy.
[58:46.400 --> 58:49.040]  So do you do exercise, Nick? Is that why you can run the fastest?
[58:49.540 --> 58:51.980]  Yes. I play basketball a lot.
[58:52.820 --> 58:53.000]  Yeah.
[58:53.540 --> 58:56.920]  He clearly exercises. He looks like he's in great shape.
[58:56.920 --> 59:04.060]  I mean, the thing that I know about Nick is that he played basketball in what seemed like a very
[59:04.820 --> 59:10.220]  upset way every day for like three years at the office, where he would just put on headphones
[59:10.220 --> 59:14.640]  and disappear and shoot hoops in a way that I can only imagine was like,
[59:14.660 --> 59:20.240]  fucking, goddamn, fucking, Jesus Christ, and just going out and doing that. That's just how it felt.
[59:20.660 --> 59:26.720]  Here's the thing about Nick, right? He's very thin, yet we know how much he eats.
[59:26.720 --> 59:30.760]  He eats like a barbarian. That's well documented, right?
[59:31.060 --> 59:36.560]  So for Nick to maintain that weight, eating with as much intake as he has,
[59:36.620 --> 59:40.440]  he must have an insane metabolism rate. And the only way to maintain a metabolism rate
[59:40.440 --> 59:44.960]  that high at his age is through strenuous and consistent activity.
[59:45.100 --> 59:45.480]  Absolutely.
[59:46.340 --> 59:48.560]  I want to be able to beat Nick at the 1500.
[59:49.240 --> 59:51.400]  Oh, I want you to. I think that would be good.
[59:51.600 --> 59:55.340]  Because I used to run that at school. I wasn't the fastest, but I could run long.
[59:55.340 --> 59:56.820]  And what year was that?
[59:57.640 --> 59:58.500]  Let me think.
[59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.080]  Yeah, probably, probably legitimately the summer of 98.
[01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.880]  Oh, nothing's changed. You'll be, if you could do it, then you can do it now.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.520]  It was a magical year, Gavin.
[01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.250]  When was the last time you ran it, Nick, if ever?
[01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:19.930]  We're the same age, so probably, probably 98 or 99.
[01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.130]  I think we should do it. I think we should get together and just see.
[01:00:22.290 --> 01:00:22.690]  All right.
[01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:23.970]  Me and Geoff will film it.
[01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.290]  Would love to see you guys do it.
[01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.430]  Good luck keeping up.
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.710]  Oh, yeah. We'll see you guys at the finish line.
[01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:36.970]  I'm also worried that I'll be, I'm overconfident and I'll legitimately die.
[01:00:37.350 --> 01:00:40.110]  You're going to hurt yourself. You're going to be legitimately hurt.
[01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.990]  And Meg is going to kill us. Yeah.
[01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:44.270]  Yeah.
[01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:50.790]  I want to do this. I want to do this and I want to film it with you, Geoff,
[01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:54.010]  like me and you standing at like the finish line. I want to be eating hot dogs while we do it.
[01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:55.250]  Oh, I think that's a great idea.
[01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.930]  Be able to knock out some of my 70.
[01:00:57.310 --> 01:00:57.390]  Yeah.
[01:00:57.450 --> 01:01:01.130]  Can maybe Nick and I get a, can there be like a halfway dog station?
[01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:06.990]  You want to stop halfway to eat a hot dog to keep running for distance?
[01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:08.230]  Just a bite. Just a bite.
[01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.150]  I like this idea.
[01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:12.210]  I want something to be looking forward to.
[01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:14.950]  Yeah, let's do it. 100% dude.
[01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:16.590]  Should we call Andrew on the phone?
[01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.770]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:19.050]  Ring him up.
[01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:21.970]  I can't use the phone.
[01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:24.170]  What?
[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.430]  I don't have, if it's a phone call, if it's not like FaceTime, I can't do it.
[01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.550]  What?
[01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:30.970]  Yeah.
[01:01:31.950 --> 01:01:32.750]  No service.
[01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:39.690]  Well, there, there you go. You made it through another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:45.010]  You, uh, can you believe we talked about hot dogs twice in the episode?
[01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.690]  Did you get enough hot dog talk? I bet you didn't. If you didn't,
[01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.850]  there's a twofer coming over on the So All Right podcast. Don't forget to check that out for
[01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:55.710]  even more hot dog facts and figures.
[01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:00.050]  And, uh, in the meantime, we're going to be eating hot dogs and running real fast.
[01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.090]  And we'll see you next week.
[01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:07.250]  Oh yeah, go to Regulatrion.com and find out all about how to give us money or not.
[01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:10.990]  Or not. Why would you want to learn about how to not give us money?
[01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:13.010]  Well, they don't have to give us money if they don't want to.
[01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:15.250]  No, they don't. But they don't have to learn about how to not give us money.
[01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:17.290]  Learn about how to give us money. Period.
[01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:20.110]  Don't learn about how not to give us money. Learn about how to give us money and then
[01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:21.890]  make an informed decision one way or the other.
[01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:23.650]  I don't give a fuck what the answer is, but yeah.
[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:24.850]  Learn about how to not give us money.
[01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.890]  Yeah, just learn how to...
[01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:26.750]  Yeah.
[01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.170]  You know what? Just, you know what? Just have a nice day.
[01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:31.030]  Okay. Oh, that sounds good. Bye.
