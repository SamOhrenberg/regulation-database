[00:00.560 --> 00:04.580]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.940 --> 00:05.900]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:06.080 --> 00:10.480]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour.
[00:11.040 --> 00:12.920]  This is Episode 17.
[00:13.560 --> 00:14.480]  Hello, gents.
[00:14.940 --> 00:19.960]  Hello. I need to use my nickname, Geoff, my actual my proper title now
[00:19.960 --> 00:26.520]  as Mr. Worldwide as one of the winners of the Olympic prediction video.
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.780]  Clearly, we have a pulse on the global community.
[00:30.940 --> 00:32.100]  You're getting right into it, huh?
[00:32.480 --> 00:34.080]  I am. Yeah, we're going right in.
[00:34.860 --> 00:35.860]  Well, should we talk about that?
[00:36.280 --> 00:39.800]  If the audience is unaware, recently we put out a piece of supplemental content.
[00:39.940 --> 00:43.280]  I highly recommend you check it out if you haven't, where we guess
[00:43.280 --> 00:47.900]  the over-unders on 25 countries
[00:47.900 --> 00:51.280]  participating in the Olympics, like the hot 25, if you will.
[00:52.200 --> 00:55.440]  And and then we tracked it throughout the well, the audience was
[00:55.440 --> 00:58.400]  very capably tracked it for us throughout the entirety of the Olympics.
[00:58.520 --> 00:58.980]  They were amazing.
[00:59.200 --> 01:01.880]  And now that the Olympics is over, we can declare how everyone did.
[01:02.280 --> 01:04.580]  Sure can. I know how I did.
[01:05.040 --> 01:05.880]  Well, I know how I did.
[01:06.740 --> 01:08.120]  Wow. I didn't come last.
[01:08.680 --> 01:11.600]  Wow. For the first time in his life, Gavin didn't come last.
[01:12.820 --> 01:17.080]  If I'd have gone all over, would I have got better score?
[01:17.520 --> 01:19.000]  We don't need you to come all over.
[01:19.860 --> 01:21.180]  I like to keep it.
[01:21.180 --> 01:21.840]  Tank.
[01:23.320 --> 01:28.400]  So the gold medal was a tie, a two way tie to Andrew and Geoff.
[01:28.440 --> 01:30.960]  Out of 25 countries, we correctly guessed 15.
[01:31.700 --> 01:34.500]  The bronze medal goes to Gavin with 13 correct choices
[01:34.500 --> 01:36.880]  by picking the under on all 25.
[01:37.820 --> 01:41.380]  And fourth place was a tie between Eric and Nick, who each had 12.
[01:42.000 --> 01:45.120]  Correctly guessed isn't exactly the word I'd describe my process.
[01:45.180 --> 01:49.440]  I'd say understood and felt the vibes of the places.
[01:51.040 --> 01:52.080]  Correctly vibed.
[01:52.300 --> 01:53.360]  Yeah, as Eric just wrote.
[01:53.980 --> 01:56.640]  No guessing involved in my part.
[01:56.880 --> 01:57.820]  But Geoff, we're tied.
[01:58.380 --> 01:59.500]  We can't have a tie.
[01:59.960 --> 02:01.620]  We got to figure out something for that.
[02:02.140 --> 02:04.020]  Do we do? I think so.
[02:04.360 --> 02:05.920]  A 1500 meter sprint.
[02:06.700 --> 02:09.080]  No, it has to be a simulation thing.
[02:09.380 --> 02:13.880]  OK, because we didn't have any direct involvement in the results of this.
[02:14.220 --> 02:17.600]  We have to come up with something that we can spectate.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.620]  What about a coin flip?
[02:22.140 --> 02:23.260]  Oh, I don't.
[02:23.460 --> 02:24.400]  Geoff is a coin guy.
[02:24.760 --> 02:27.080]  That seems unfair to Andrew.
[02:27.500 --> 02:28.180]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.620]  It's like it's like it wouldn't make sense for us to bet on hockey.
[02:30.720 --> 02:33.280]  I would be fucked if you can't bet on coin.
[02:33.380 --> 02:36.520]  Didn't I go like oh and 10 when Eric was flipping coins
[02:36.520 --> 02:38.640]  previously in the podcast at one point?
[02:39.180 --> 02:43.060]  I don't think I want to do coins based on past history of this show.
[02:44.240 --> 02:45.740]  The Paralympics is coming up.
[02:46.780 --> 02:49.240]  We have college football starting.
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.640]  The NFL preseason is going right now.
[02:53.460 --> 02:54.820]  WNBA is coming back.
[02:55.300 --> 02:58.140]  I think if you guys do the whole college football season,
[02:58.200 --> 03:00.900]  I think that's a great way to settle who is superior in the Olympics.
[03:00.980 --> 03:05.200]  But that's just the whole college football season.
[03:05.420 --> 03:07.680]  Well, yeah, you have to get it to fit where you wanted one game.
[03:07.940 --> 03:08.640]  Boring. You got it.
[03:08.660 --> 03:10.080]  It's got to be definitive, dude.
[03:10.100 --> 03:11.800]  Stretch that out. Huh?
[03:12.660 --> 03:14.420]  I yeah, I guess what we pick conference.
[03:14.480 --> 03:15.040]  I don't even know.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.860]  I barely know how college football works.
[03:17.060 --> 03:18.240]  I feel pretty good about this then.
[03:18.700 --> 03:20.580]  I'm like, what are what are the vibes?
[03:20.660 --> 03:21.960]  What are like the college vibes?
[03:22.100 --> 03:24.360]  You know, it doesn't matter how it works.
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.400]  You got to just sort of go with the vibes.
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.220]  The Rainbow Warriors are about to win back to back college football championships.
[03:30.480 --> 03:31.240]  That's the vibes.
[03:31.340 --> 03:35.820]  I'm only aware of what's happening in my fictitious college football world.
[03:37.560 --> 03:39.340]  The general vibes, I don't know.
[03:39.920 --> 03:41.140]  I don't even know how to track that.
[03:41.820 --> 03:44.020]  But I would like to as an aside from this,
[03:44.020 --> 03:48.480]  I'd like to get into some NFL stuff this season as like a show.
[03:49.020 --> 03:50.480]  I talk about doing kickers.
[03:50.660 --> 03:51.540]  I want to do.
[03:51.660 --> 03:54.660]  Have you guys ever done an eliminator pool for like a pick them eliminator?
[03:54.980 --> 03:56.540]  I think that'd be really fun with the audience.
[03:57.080 --> 03:57.500]  What is that?
[03:58.160 --> 04:02.620]  You so it's every team in the league and you have to pick one winner,
[04:02.820 --> 04:04.580]  but you can only pick that team once.
[04:04.980 --> 04:07.260]  And if they win, you continue on.
[04:07.320 --> 04:11.040]  But if the team you pick loses, you're eliminated from the pool
[04:11.580 --> 04:13.400]  and you just keep going until there's a winner.
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.520]  So it goes two weeks?
[04:16.160 --> 04:17.220]  No, it goes the whole season.
[04:17.400 --> 04:17.580]  Potentially.
[04:17.660 --> 04:18.000]  Is it really?
[04:18.700 --> 04:19.140]  Yes.
[04:19.860 --> 04:21.060]  But the way we play it?
[04:21.600 --> 04:24.100]  I was. Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know, man.
[04:24.120 --> 04:24.720]  That's pretty funny.
[04:24.940 --> 04:28.380]  It will be a tournament in which we spectate and watch the community
[04:28.380 --> 04:30.020]  see who wins there.
[04:30.360 --> 04:34.040]  But I think it'd be fun because you have to you have to guess
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.620]  like when an underdog will win is like the challenge of it.
[04:37.860 --> 04:40.660]  I'm all for doing any version of this.
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.760]  I had so much fun doing the Olympics over and under.
[04:43.760 --> 04:45.020]  That I would love to do it again.
[04:45.020 --> 04:48.420]  And the summer movie thing, which is still ongoing, by the way.
[04:49.260 --> 04:52.080]  I believe, Andrew, you just leapt into first place, didn't you?
[04:52.140 --> 04:52.520]  Over the weekend?
[04:52.780 --> 04:56.140]  Mr. Worldwide, Mr. Box Office printing machine.
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.880]  I can rework the second one.
[04:57.920 --> 04:59.940]  That one we got to put in the shop.
[05:00.140 --> 05:04.180]  Andrew, you might be de-throning Howard Stern as the new king of all media.
[05:04.320 --> 05:04.640]  Look at you.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.920]  Yeah, that's on top of the Internet world.
[05:09.700 --> 05:11.520]  But anyway, I've had so much fun doing both of those
[05:11.520 --> 05:14.420]  that I would love to do something with NFL or college football.
[05:14.620 --> 05:17.540]  You know, my family, we actually invited Andrew two years ago.
[05:17.900 --> 05:20.180]  My family, my wife's family does a college pick them.
[05:20.300 --> 05:23.740]  And it it has become the most intense
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.100]  and like thrilling thing
[05:28.100 --> 05:30.920]  in my life for the four or five months the college football.
[05:31.100 --> 05:34.620]  I got just competing against her dad and uncle and her and Kent
[05:34.620 --> 05:35.660]  and all those people.
[05:35.820 --> 05:40.280]  I got screwed in that pool by ESPN's poor wording.
[05:40.280 --> 05:42.880]  Oh, because I know I knew nothing about.
[05:43.020 --> 05:44.160]  I was having a great season.
[05:44.260 --> 05:46.340]  We talked about it and I was killing it.
[05:46.680 --> 05:47.600]  And then I didn't.
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.160]  I was scared to do research.
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.440]  And I went to put in my picks and it said, you're too early.
[05:53.920 --> 05:55.600]  I thought, that's OK, whatever.
[05:55.940 --> 05:57.140]  I'll come back later, I guess.
[05:57.480 --> 05:58.500]  And then all the games happened.
[05:58.560 --> 05:58.960]  I forgot.
[05:59.360 --> 06:01.020]  And that happened several weeks in a row.
[06:01.340 --> 06:04.340]  What they meant by you're too early is you're not signed in.
[06:04.640 --> 06:05.760]  That is how they communicate.
[06:05.840 --> 06:07.320]  You're not signed in to make picks.
[06:07.500 --> 06:09.540]  I didn't realize I wasn't signed in.
[06:09.540 --> 06:13.300]  So I just didn't make picks for like three weeks and a tank by season.
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.840]  There's no coming back from that.
[06:15.200 --> 06:16.760]  And that's definitely their fault.
[06:17.500 --> 06:20.500]  Uh, the phrase you're not signed in as you're too early.
[06:20.660 --> 06:21.920]  Yes, that is their fault.
[06:22.200 --> 06:24.700]  OK, that is an insane way to phrase.
[06:24.920 --> 06:27.660]  So wait, so like you're like halfway through week two
[06:27.660 --> 06:30.180]  and it's still saying you're too early and you're just like, damn, man.
[06:30.280 --> 06:31.760]  I wonder when we start picking these.
[06:31.860 --> 06:35.780]  Well, no, it's because I would never because I have no awareness
[06:35.780 --> 06:38.340]  of what the college football schedule is.
[06:38.340 --> 06:43.380]  I would remember late, like at the end of the week at like 1 a.m.
[06:43.400 --> 06:46.840]  ago, oh, fuck, I got to do picks and then I'd go to do it
[06:46.840 --> 06:51.280]  and it would say you're too early and I'd go, OK, I guess I'm early.
[06:51.380 --> 06:53.660]  I don't know. I've no idea what's happening with the schedule.
[06:53.800 --> 06:55.240]  Wait, you would go too late.
[06:55.940 --> 06:58.060]  You would scramble to make your picks
[06:58.580 --> 07:01.060]  and you would think because you're so late, you're early.
[07:01.340 --> 07:05.060]  It was a never ending cycle of I never knew when the game started or ended
[07:05.060 --> 07:08.620]  because I couldn't look into it because I was scared if I did research,
[07:08.660 --> 07:12.620]  I would lose, but then I would just never submit picks
[07:12.620 --> 07:14.800]  because I never knew when I was early or late.
[07:14.940 --> 07:17.380]  It wasn't like NFL where I knew on a Saturday night.
[07:17.440 --> 07:19.700]  OK, no, this isn't they start tomorrow.
[07:19.800 --> 07:22.800]  These games, I never teacher.
[07:22.980 --> 07:27.020]  I never turned in my homework because I was I wasn't sure what day.
[07:27.140 --> 07:31.920]  Well, I knew a day it was due, but I didn't know when if I was too early or late.
[07:31.920 --> 07:35.540]  So I just sort of I held on to my homework and I don't know why you did that to me.
[07:35.600 --> 07:37.740]  I don't want to I don't want to turn on my homework too early
[07:37.740 --> 07:39.180]  because I was scared you might lose it.
[07:39.220 --> 07:40.460]  So I just held on to it forever.
[07:40.620 --> 07:42.460]  Can we focus on that?
[07:42.540 --> 07:45.880]  It's insane to say you're not signed in by saying you're too early.
[07:46.100 --> 07:50.800]  Has it ever happened in professional sports where a team got the day wrong?
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.420]  I bet.
[07:54.120 --> 07:58.580]  I had a really dumb football question for you, Gavin,
[07:58.980 --> 08:00.500]  that I don't think even makes sense.
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.540]  Wait, which football?
[08:02.100 --> 08:04.920]  The one, you know, that's why I'd be asking you. OK.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.480]  Yeah. Not the NFL. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:09.420 --> 08:10.340]  Hit me with it.
[08:11.140 --> 08:12.140]  I know this is my thought.
[08:12.240 --> 08:14.500]  And this is what, you know, Johnny Caviar came from.
[08:14.720 --> 08:16.880]  I woke up and that was just the first thing in my brain.
[08:17.480 --> 08:20.020]  I woke up either today or yesterday.
[08:20.140 --> 08:21.520]  I don't remember as groggy.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.500]  And I thought, has there ever been, you know, the expression
[08:25.500 --> 08:28.820]  a stitch in time saves nine? I think that's the expression.
[08:29.460 --> 08:33.660]  Has there ever been a time in a football game where a save in time
[08:33.660 --> 08:36.860]  has prevented nine penalty shots from occurring,
[08:37.000 --> 08:41.660]  like a shot at the end of the game that was made and stopped?
[08:42.460 --> 08:44.200]  I guess we wouldn't know, would we?
[08:45.800 --> 08:47.780]  Has there ever been it? Let me reverse this.
[08:47.900 --> 08:51.600]  Has there ever been a missed one where there have been nine penalty shots
[08:51.600 --> 08:54.100]  taken because somebody flubbed at the last second?
[08:55.540 --> 08:57.740]  Has something happened in the last second
[08:57.740 --> 08:59.920]  that caused a penalty shootout of nine shots?
[08:59.940 --> 09:00.760]  Yes. Is that what you're asking?
[09:01.240 --> 09:02.160]  That is what I'm asking.
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.380]  Oh, I'm sure of it.
[09:03.760 --> 09:04.960]  Has to have. Yeah.
[09:06.220 --> 09:09.240]  I like that that was like the first thing you thought of this morning.
[09:09.700 --> 09:11.060]  That was in my head.
[09:11.300 --> 09:15.080]  I realized at the time I was like, oh, it's just like the expression.
[09:15.500 --> 09:19.220]  A save in time saves nine.
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.420]  It's just like the expression.
[09:22.420 --> 09:25.880]  And then that's so funny because the first thing I thought of this morning
[09:25.880 --> 09:27.480]  was just as much nonsense.
[09:27.720 --> 09:31.840]  I woke up almost panicked, wondering why they didn't call the second
[09:31.840 --> 09:35.180]  super troopers, super troopers, troopers.
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.100]  And then I was like, well, that would make any sense.
[09:42.160 --> 09:42.900]  What am I talking about?
[09:43.400 --> 09:46.140]  It would be better if it was troopers troopers.
[09:46.140 --> 09:48.700]  Yeah. Oh, super duper troopers.
[09:49.160 --> 09:51.300]  That's not what you went with.
[09:51.900 --> 09:54.880]  Super. Oh, like French, too.
[09:56.160 --> 09:57.820]  Oh, is that what duper is?
[09:58.520 --> 10:01.040]  No, I mean. Yeah, that's what duper means.
[10:02.140 --> 10:03.460]  It's too French.
[10:03.620 --> 10:05.120]  Duper. Yeah.
[10:07.880 --> 10:09.860]  I've been I've been watching a lot of the Olympics.
[10:09.960 --> 10:11.080]  So I'm picking up on this stuff.
[10:15.840 --> 10:17.220]  Oh, man. Soccer blue.
[10:17.300 --> 10:19.020]  We won by duper last night.
[10:22.660 --> 10:23.700]  Duper is wild.
[10:28.740 --> 10:33.320]  So this frickin this frickin movie thing, I can't believe how tight it is.
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.300]  You're now beating me by what?
[10:36.340 --> 10:37.340]  Like 20 something mil?
[10:37.860 --> 10:38.860]  Yeah, barely, dude.
[10:38.880 --> 10:40.460]  And I'm right there, like on your heels.
[10:40.540 --> 10:42.240]  So we're all about you.
[10:42.360 --> 10:43.420]  It's all bunched up.
[10:43.600 --> 10:45.160]  Andrew has two movies.
[10:45.760 --> 10:47.220]  Luckily, I got my plus nine.
[10:47.320 --> 10:47.820]  You know what I mean?
[10:47.820 --> 10:53.140]  Andrew has two movies that are more than Eric's total and Geoff's total.
[10:53.680 --> 10:59.500]  Yeah. You have one movie that is more than Geoff and Eric's combined.
[11:01.600 --> 11:02.880]  Maybe even Geoff.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.540]  It's close between Geoff and Nick.
[11:05.540 --> 11:08.300]  I'm kind of counting here on on my alien, right?
[11:08.380 --> 11:10.060]  It is. It's going to come down to alien.
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.000]  Yeah. And if it makes under 100 million.
[11:12.260 --> 11:13.420]  Me too. And I'm counting on the crow.
[11:14.620 --> 11:16.660]  And I'm counting on Betelgeuse.
[11:17.360 --> 11:19.040]  Oh, boy. You're fucked.
[11:19.440 --> 11:21.160]  Yeah, you're fucked. I'm in it, though.
[11:21.540 --> 11:25.520]  What do you think the chances are Betelgeuse could make 700 million domestic?
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.100]  It would require every person to see it as many times as you have to say it.
[11:32.220 --> 11:33.400]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[11:33.460 --> 11:34.820]  Triple view from everyone.
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.080]  I also think what you're not counting is like I'm like, oh, the crow, the crow.
[11:40.260 --> 11:41.580]  Dude, I got I got Reagan.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.860]  So you might be fucked.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.560]  People might be like, politics are hot right now.
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.500]  They are. Yeah.
[11:46.700 --> 11:49.040]  People, people might want to go see, OK, what's this?
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.540]  I got to see what's up with this Reagan guy.
[11:52.940 --> 11:56.000]  And they and that might it might net me a lot of money.
[11:56.200 --> 11:57.260]  I might blow by Geoff.
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.480]  I've never had this happen, but it just occurred to me how funny it would be
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.960]  if it came down to hundreds of dollars between two people.
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.220]  And just the idea of like you actually could sway the box office
[12:10.220 --> 12:11.600]  by personally buying tickets.
[12:11.980 --> 12:14.800]  You throwing money at this thing could result in winning.
[12:14.800 --> 12:17.680]  And we've got our dollar amount leftovers.
[12:18.060 --> 12:19.320]  That's true. Yeah.
[12:20.800 --> 12:21.440]  You're monopoly.
[12:21.800 --> 12:23.280]  You should have kept you should have kept some points, Andrew.
[12:23.340 --> 12:26.200]  You might be fucked at the end that Gavin's team might steamroll.
[12:26.260 --> 12:28.800]  You're right. Just squeeze right over Gavin.
[12:28.980 --> 12:31.540]  I didn't even remember that he has 50.
[12:31.740 --> 12:32.540]  But that's so funny.
[12:33.500 --> 12:34.600]  You really wasted that.
[12:34.640 --> 12:35.560]  You could have got twister.
[12:36.380 --> 12:38.300]  I was just waiting for the big hitters.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.680]  Twisters to 200 plus mil.
[12:41.960 --> 12:42.460]  That's insane.
[12:42.520 --> 12:43.260]  That's nine points.
[12:44.100 --> 12:47.280]  That was I actually felt better if I lose to you.
[12:47.400 --> 12:51.120]  I looked at the price of everything and my mistakes,
[12:51.280 --> 12:55.720]  which were the watchers and fly me to the moon for nine total points.
[12:55.720 --> 12:57.620]  But there's still got the best value.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.520]  Who got the most money per point?
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.800]  I mean, it has to be pretty good.
[13:02.080 --> 13:03.740]  It's 35 for 636.
[13:03.880 --> 13:05.360]  It has to be twisters at nine, right?
[13:05.960 --> 13:08.880]  Nine points at 222 million dollars.
[13:08.940 --> 13:10.240]  That's insane. That's insane.
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.760]  Compared to Wolverine, Deadpool and Wolverine is 494 million
[13:15.760 --> 13:19.760]  at the time of this recording, 494 million at 68 points.
[13:19.840 --> 13:22.240]  We got to check how much Eric spent on Borderlands.
[13:22.340 --> 13:22.680]  One sec.
[13:22.940 --> 13:23.800]  Yeah, that's right.
[13:24.060 --> 13:25.360]  Borderlands might save me.
[13:25.820 --> 13:27.800]  Borderlands. What did Borderlands do? 8 million.
[13:28.060 --> 13:28.460]  Is that right?
[13:28.580 --> 13:31.400]  Yeah, I'm sneaking up slow.
[13:31.620 --> 13:33.620]  Oh, I'm creeping into people are going to go.
[13:33.720 --> 13:35.220]  Oh man, I heard Borderlands is good.
[13:35.260 --> 13:36.640]  I got to go see that. Right.
[13:37.180 --> 13:40.360]  Looking at you spend double digit points on Borderlands
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.040]  and it makes single million digit amounts of money.
[13:43.140 --> 13:47.360]  I feel like even you overpaid for Borderlands, like the studio and you.
[13:47.780 --> 13:51.140]  Yeah. I mean, at that point, at that point, you're just low on the board
[13:51.140 --> 13:52.280]  and you're taking swings, right?
[13:52.360 --> 13:54.100]  You're just sort of like. Yeah, it was. Yeah.
[13:54.100 --> 13:55.820]  Yeah. Yeah, I'll take the point. Sure.
[13:56.380 --> 14:00.040]  Could we commission the people that made these sites to have them?
[14:01.420 --> 14:03.240]  Like, what if we had it on our website?
[14:04.420 --> 14:06.300]  That'd be cool. I'd love to do something like that.
[14:06.300 --> 14:09.240]  What's our website? Regulatrion.com.
[14:11.000 --> 14:14.200]  Yeah, well, yeah, whatever we've got, we don't have a website, do we?
[14:15.460 --> 14:16.620]  What is happening?
[14:17.020 --> 14:18.660]  What website do you think we have?
[14:18.660 --> 14:21.540]  I was thinking of that old landing page that we had for the old.
[14:21.860 --> 14:23.140]  Roosterteeth.com?
[14:23.760 --> 14:24.740]  Well, it was slash.
[14:25.380 --> 14:27.520]  It was FacePod.com, wasn't it?
[14:27.940 --> 14:30.920]  Oh, yes. Which took you to Roosterteeth.com.
[14:31.520 --> 14:35.980]  All right, well, take it somewhere else now and we can have all of the current feeds
[14:35.980 --> 14:39.180]  of all of the current fake money draft shite.
[14:39.740 --> 14:42.060]  I love it. I think that's a great idea.
[14:42.620 --> 14:45.660]  I also, yeah, it'd be cool to have that on our Patreon or something.
[14:46.840 --> 14:47.940]  In some form. Yeah.
[14:48.420 --> 14:51.400]  Do you ever look at your health as like a percentage?
[14:52.240 --> 14:54.100]  No, and that's my problem.
[14:54.460 --> 14:56.640]  That is my problem. Hang on. Hang on.
[14:57.540 --> 14:59.560]  Don't you only look at your health in a percent?
[14:59.560 --> 15:01.380]  We talk about your ankle percents only.
[15:01.500 --> 15:03.600]  No. OK, we I think we've talked about this before, too.
[15:04.220 --> 15:09.060]  If we talk about this constantly, if the human body worked like crackdown
[15:09.060 --> 15:12.960]  or like where I get a skill point for doing something that I could apply
[15:12.960 --> 15:15.900]  somewhere, I would be in the best shape.
[15:16.920 --> 15:19.540]  That's the timeline in which I'm in the Olympics.
[15:20.060 --> 15:20.940]  Wait, why would you what?
[15:21.620 --> 15:24.160]  I don't understand. Didn't you just say percents?
[15:24.740 --> 15:26.040]  No, this is what I'm saying.
[15:27.020 --> 15:30.020]  You got to level up right in a game with percentages.
[15:30.680 --> 15:31.800]  That's what you're talking about.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.220]  If you'd seen percentages,
[15:33.380 --> 15:38.940]  if I could see that my strength is 20 percent of what could be 100 percent.
[15:39.180 --> 15:40.260]  What's 100 percent, though?
[15:40.360 --> 15:43.260]  You're the strongest you could be or the strongest anyone could be.
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.300]  The strongest I could possibly be.
[15:45.500 --> 15:49.000]  I think everyone would have their own limits within their frame.
[15:49.460 --> 15:53.740]  I would assume I'm not a doctor, but if I could see that
[15:54.380 --> 15:58.380]  and if I could if I could do, let's say, like a bicep curl
[15:58.380 --> 16:01.120]  and see like I went up a quarter of a point,
[16:01.120 --> 16:03.600]  then I would be chasing those things like achievements.
[16:03.980 --> 16:05.840]  I need that visual chase.
[16:05.980 --> 16:06.900]  Let me ask you a question.
[16:07.060 --> 16:08.660]  What's your ankle integrity at right now?
[16:08.780 --> 16:11.500]  That's 99 percent. That's what I'm saying. Like what?
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.600]  Well, but that's health.
[16:13.860 --> 16:14.620]  That's a health bar.
[16:15.120 --> 16:16.500]  I'm going to I got a health bar.
[16:16.820 --> 16:19.880]  My current health is zero percent.
[16:20.360 --> 16:21.660]  I'm going to throw up.
[16:22.040 --> 16:23.800]  I'm so I'm like seeing red.
[16:24.060 --> 16:24.960]  I'm going to flip.
[16:25.400 --> 16:28.460]  There's a green filter over the picture of his head right now
[16:28.460 --> 16:29.840]  and his cheeks got a little blue.
[16:31.020 --> 16:34.300]  You've given an answer that's so weird that I don't even know
[16:34.300 --> 16:35.380]  where I was going with that.
[16:36.040 --> 16:37.440]  I think you're talking about glory holes.
[16:38.160 --> 16:39.520]  I was talking about bread rolls.
[16:40.200 --> 16:42.320]  Glory. Yeah. Bread rolls and glory. Oh,
[16:43.920 --> 16:48.460]  I was I think I think the other day I got so hot while I was mowing.
[16:49.200 --> 16:54.180]  It was, you know, pushing 40 degrees again, just sweating constantly,
[16:54.420 --> 16:56.480]  like not a moment where a drip isn't coming off me.
[16:56.620 --> 16:58.060]  And by the end of it, I thought,
[16:58.060 --> 16:59.820]  how close to death am I right now?
[17:00.520 --> 17:04.640]  I felt like if if my health was a percentage that started the morning at 100,
[17:05.080 --> 17:08.480]  I must have been at like 65 percent.
[17:09.040 --> 17:13.320]  Yeah. Like if I kept going for much longer, would I eventually have died?
[17:13.780 --> 17:15.920]  And you could drop really fast, too.
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.100]  You could go from like 65 to like 30 in like a couple of seconds.
[17:20.160 --> 17:24.380]  I was watching a reality TV show the other day about like a race through Alaska.
[17:24.640 --> 17:26.100]  And it was this married couple.
[17:26.100 --> 17:28.680]  And the lady was complaining about needing electrolytes
[17:28.680 --> 17:30.180]  and feeling like she was a little lightheaded.
[17:30.360 --> 17:31.960]  And he's like, oh, you're fine. Keep going.
[17:32.120 --> 17:36.960]  And then 30 seconds later, she passed out and they had to like helicopter her out.
[17:37.040 --> 17:41.320]  She spent three days in the ICU just from having a heatstroke.
[17:41.400 --> 17:43.700]  It fucking shut her whole body down.
[17:44.120 --> 17:45.620]  So health is like an iPhone.
[17:46.080 --> 17:49.920]  That's a couple of years old gets to like nine percent and then just turns off.
[17:50.220 --> 17:53.320]  Yeah. Your health is like an iPhone where when you get below 20 percent,
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.840]  you have no idea. Yeah.
[17:55.260 --> 17:58.300]  Do you think that was the the worst take by that guy of all time?
[17:58.680 --> 18:00.800]  Yeah, I'm assuming he didn't as an all time.
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.960]  He didn't endear himself to all the wives of the world watching it.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.320]  I'm sure he it didn't it didn't come across super well in the in the episode.
[18:08.780 --> 18:11.900]  But but it's just crazy because you're I was I was so flabbergasted by that
[18:11.900 --> 18:12.560]  because you're watching it.
[18:12.600 --> 18:15.780]  And you're like, these people are in the like these people are racing across Alaska
[18:15.780 --> 18:18.200]  doing like 20 miles a day through the wilderness.
[18:18.200 --> 18:21.300]  And it's insane what they're, you know, physically capable of.
[18:21.300 --> 18:25.400]  And then one, you just shows you like, even if you're in amazing shape,
[18:25.460 --> 18:29.400]  you just get a little bit over over your skis
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.880]  and suddenly you're super fucked, you know?
[18:34.340 --> 18:38.700]  God, yeah, I guess that for me, going back to the level up system,
[18:39.320 --> 18:40.680]  seeing the number go up
[18:42.140 --> 18:45.660]  is exciting to me, seeing the number go down does nothing for me.
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.840]  What do you mean?
[18:48.580 --> 18:50.200]  Because death is inevitable.
[18:50.200 --> 18:53.840]  The number is going to hit zero no matter what at some stage.
[18:54.180 --> 18:56.880]  But if I could do something that rate.
[18:57.100 --> 18:58.920]  Oh, I guess that would be it, right?
[18:58.940 --> 19:02.340]  Like if I could do things and I would see the number go up,
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.000]  what my health percentage was, then that'd be something.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.760]  I'm only thinking about it in a singular way, though.
[19:09.300 --> 19:10.580]  It going. Oh, you don't say.
[19:12.000 --> 19:15.500]  If it went both ways, if it teeter tottered, that wouldn't be fun.
[19:15.700 --> 19:18.160]  Imagine being like 32 dogs into your year
[19:18.160 --> 19:20.600]  and just seeing it go down after one bite.
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.620]  Yeah. If you're in six dogs a day and then you woke up and you had like 12 percent,
[19:25.900 --> 19:28.060]  surely you would be panicked by the decreasing number.
[19:28.640 --> 19:31.420]  You don't need to have a number in front of you to know
[19:31.420 --> 19:33.800]  that you're not well from eating so many hot dogs.
[19:34.200 --> 19:37.400]  No, but I think it would be interesting to see
[19:37.400 --> 19:40.220]  or to be able to know how many dogs would kill you.
[19:40.940 --> 19:43.880]  I don't want to throw a skittle in and see my number go down
[19:43.880 --> 19:45.280]  because of a singular skittle.
[19:45.380 --> 19:47.580]  Now skittles are off that I can enjoy skittles now.
[19:47.580 --> 19:50.600]  I don't think a skittle would dent out an entire percentage.
[19:51.180 --> 19:52.560]  But it could be the straw.
[19:53.100 --> 19:58.400]  We know a human being can eat as many as 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes
[19:58.400 --> 20:00.200]  and still be considered an athlete.
[20:00.440 --> 20:01.800]  So it can't be too negative.
[20:01.920 --> 20:05.320]  That's a year's worth of hot dogs Joey Chestnut ate in 10 minutes.
[20:05.880 --> 20:06.800]  And he seems fine.
[20:07.440 --> 20:10.000]  I saw the old dog count go up a couple of times recently.
[20:10.480 --> 20:14.220]  Well, yeah, yeah, I dipped in the dogs this weekend a little bit.
[20:14.280 --> 20:15.200]  Where were you dogging?
[20:15.580 --> 20:17.800]  I dogged at home, baby. I made hot dogs.
[20:18.060 --> 20:18.920]  You're home dogging?
[20:19.160 --> 20:19.820]  And I was home dogging.
[20:19.900 --> 20:21.320]  Yeah, I went and got some Oscar Meyers.
[20:22.760 --> 20:26.700]  That that also needs to be a live updated thing on our website.
[20:26.940 --> 20:28.480]  The dog count? Yeah.
[20:29.000 --> 20:30.660]  All right. And what's our website again?
[20:30.840 --> 20:32.520]  Stats. Regulatory on dot com.
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.320]  Dude, I don't want to.
[20:34.540 --> 20:38.440]  I don't want to I don't want to take too much shit from my other podcast.
[20:39.660 --> 20:43.920]  But I was I was, you know, doing hot dog work on the other podcast.
[20:43.920 --> 20:45.220]  The so all right one.
[20:45.720 --> 20:47.160]  And I ran across I read, yeah, part two.
[20:47.320 --> 20:49.420]  I ran across a fact that blew my fucking mind.
[20:49.540 --> 20:53.080]  You know, I told you guys last time that the average human,
[20:53.380 --> 20:55.960]  the average American eats 70 hot dogs a year.
[20:56.860 --> 21:00.460]  But I was looking at what state consumes the most hot dogs.
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.100]  It's West Virginia.
[21:02.500 --> 21:06.200]  And do you have any idea how many hot dogs the average West
[21:06.200 --> 21:07.720]  Virginian eats in a year?
[21:08.260 --> 21:09.340]  Hundred. Oh, this is a good.
[21:09.460 --> 21:10.800]  Oh, let's think. Let's guess.
[21:10.920 --> 21:12.760]  Everybody throw down a number. Think about it.
[21:12.760 --> 21:14.660]  Don't just throw out a number. Think about it.
[21:14.720 --> 21:17.400]  The average American eats 70 hot dogs a year.
[21:17.480 --> 21:19.620]  And this is OK. More.
[21:20.080 --> 21:20.840]  One hundred and eleven.
[21:21.360 --> 21:22.700]  I'm walking in. Eighty eight.
[21:23.420 --> 21:24.860]  One twenty. Whoa.
[21:25.580 --> 21:26.600]  Nick. One hundred.
[21:27.340 --> 21:30.060]  I believe it was four hundred and eighty one.
[21:30.500 --> 21:31.800]  OK, that's not right.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.820]  There's a number that's according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage
[21:35.820 --> 21:39.640]  Council. West Virginians eat four hundred and eighty one hot dogs.
[21:39.640 --> 21:44.180]  Somewhere, a cargo plane full of dogs went down in West Virginia
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.900]  and it somehow got added to the total.
[21:46.340 --> 21:48.720]  It's 80. Their number is 81.
[21:48.960 --> 21:52.660]  Somebody's finger slipped and hit the four at the beginning and they didn't delete it.
[21:52.760 --> 21:56.200]  Like, no, I have my hot dog can is at four.
[21:56.360 --> 21:58.760]  And I'm like, I've been hitting the dogs pretty hard lately.
[21:59.080 --> 22:04.340]  And in like two weeks, it's yeah, it's that stat is bollocks.
[22:04.540 --> 22:06.560]  It can't be real, but it's on a website.
[22:07.560 --> 22:09.040]  Well, that makes it real.
[22:09.040 --> 22:11.880]  That's it's on a hot dog council website.
[22:11.960 --> 22:12.860]  How can it not be real?
[22:13.600 --> 22:15.460]  How many hot dog councils are there?
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.040]  Also, like, I don't understand how they're surveying these people.
[22:19.140 --> 22:22.400]  Like who's doing an accurate count of all these dogs?
[22:23.520 --> 22:26.340]  I think it's going based off of sales and then assuming
[22:27.300 --> 22:32.360]  to the National Hot Dog Council's website is hot dash dog dot org.
[22:34.560 --> 22:38.920]  Dude, you can become you can become a hot dog ambassador.
[22:39.040 --> 22:41.240]  I would like to. I'd like to get into that game.
[22:41.340 --> 22:42.140]  I don't know how to do that.
[22:42.200 --> 22:43.820]  I don't know how to break into the hot dog world.
[22:43.940 --> 22:47.920]  But man, I mean, it should be clear from the past month of my life
[22:47.920 --> 22:50.360]  that I'm trying really hard to lean into it.
[22:50.640 --> 22:53.220]  Is what's the best way to wash down your dog?
[22:53.340 --> 22:55.320]  Forty eight percent say iced tea.
[22:56.300 --> 22:58.320]  This sucks. This website sucks.
[22:58.500 --> 23:01.300]  It does. But it's been a goldmine of information for me
[23:01.300 --> 23:03.580]  for the last two episodes of my other podcast.
[23:04.200 --> 23:05.020]  Oh, man.
[23:05.760 --> 23:10.600]  This is an ad for my bookie.
[23:10.680 --> 23:12.780]  Wow. I feel kind of like Bill Burr right now.
[23:13.200 --> 23:16.760]  I don't know if you are into gambling or betting or booking.
[23:17.220 --> 23:21.480]  I am. I didn't realize I was until I started spending time in Vegas
[23:21.480 --> 23:23.400]  and discovered the horses.
[23:24.040 --> 23:28.060]  And since then, my wife and I have had so much fun
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.660]  gambling on horses specifically.
[23:31.040 --> 23:35.000]  You would think being a basketball fan and a baseball fan and a football fan,
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.120]  I would bet on those things.
[23:36.300 --> 23:38.700]  And sometimes I do. But for me, I don't know what I think.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.520]  It's the Charles Bukowski of it all.
[23:40.920 --> 23:45.620]  All the books I read, he he really romanticized the tracks.
[23:46.200 --> 23:47.760]  And I guess that must be the appeal.
[23:48.120 --> 23:50.900]  But whatever it is, I am definitely into it.
[23:50.960 --> 23:53.320]  I do it whenever I can, responsibly, of course.
[23:53.760 --> 23:56.200]  And that's why I want to talk to you about my bookie.
[23:56.340 --> 23:59.740]  Whether you are a college football fan who's rooting for your alma mater
[23:59.740 --> 24:04.200]  or you just love the entirety of the sport and you follow it all,
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.820]  there is no better way to experience the thrills of the season
[24:07.820 --> 24:10.880]  than by putting a little skin in the game, as it were.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.800]  And by skin, I mean your money.
[24:13.320 --> 24:15.840]  When you bet with my bookie, you are not just watching the games.
[24:15.840 --> 24:18.460]  You are investing in every moment of the action.
[24:18.680 --> 24:19.420]  Ain't that the truth?
[24:19.940 --> 24:24.720]  Did you know that the average college football game runs about 180 plays?
[24:24.800 --> 24:27.620]  Because I didn't until I just found that out right now.
[24:27.900 --> 24:30.580]  That means every sack, every catch, every touchdown,
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.520]  every moment of significance on the field is another way to hit pay dirt with my bookie.
[24:35.940 --> 24:38.660]  If you want to ratchet up the intensity, a few bucks on the line
[24:38.660 --> 24:42.600]  can turn any regular season game into a highlight of the season.
[24:42.820 --> 24:45.340]  It instantly becomes a playoff type atmosphere.
[24:45.520 --> 24:47.000]  Are you ready for the ultimate college?
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.220]  I'm talking about college football right now because college football's just hit.
[24:50.340 --> 24:56.080]  You could do NFL, NBA and hockey are, you know, about two months away still.
[24:56.420 --> 24:59.180]  And of course, the horses are always running, baby.
[24:59.180 --> 25:03.760]  But if you are ready for the ultimate challenge, it is my bookie's 10th anniversary
[25:03.760 --> 25:08.100]  and you can bet on every game, every sport, anytime, anywhere,

[26:08.640 --> 26:10.580]  Hot-dog.sucks?
[26:10.880 --> 26:13.640]  Because I've noticed, Eric, that we don't have a website anymore.
[26:14.240 --> 26:16.320]  And I found... Oh, is that what you've noticed?
[26:16.780 --> 26:20.620]  And I found that Eric.sucks is available.
[26:21.540 --> 26:24.640]  This, this whole fucking segment .sucks.
[26:25.160 --> 26:27.540]  Is this .sucks available?
[26:27.980 --> 26:30.060]  That's Chocolatay to Eric right there.
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.300]  This .sucks is taken. Damn it.
[26:32.940 --> 26:35.040]  Damn. Who's got the most?
[26:35.160 --> 26:36.340]  That's $999.
[26:37.700 --> 26:38.600]  Oh, what? Eric.sucks?
[26:38.940 --> 26:39.660]  Eric.sucks.
[26:39.760 --> 26:42.580]  But then after a year, it goes up to $2,600 a year.
[26:42.780 --> 26:44.560]  Holy shit. That's crazy.
[26:45.560 --> 26:49.480]  I wonder if Geoff.sucks... Geoff.sucks is so cheap.
[26:49.480 --> 26:50.660]  How much am I like?
[26:51.160 --> 26:54.220]  It's $99 for the first year and then $400.
[26:54.840 --> 26:55.580]  No, that's a steal.
[26:55.820 --> 26:59.280]  That's a... Thank God my mom named me that weird ass Geoff spelling.
[27:00.320 --> 27:01.280]  Andrew.sucks.
[27:01.420 --> 27:02.420]  Oh, another pricey one.
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.860]  Uh-oh. Nick.sucks.
[27:05.180 --> 27:06.860]  Very pricey. Oh, yeah.
[27:07.520 --> 27:07.980]  What about Gavin?
[27:08.560 --> 27:10.180]  Gavin.sucks is a cheap one.
[27:10.600 --> 27:11.520]  Geoff, we can get ours.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.540]  So tune on into our website, Gavin.sucks.
[27:18.240 --> 27:19.620]  If you want to join our Patreon.
[27:20.100 --> 27:21.380]  That sounds awesome.
[27:21.960 --> 27:24.960]  I can't believe how much Eric.sucks costs.
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.600]  That's fucking crazy.
[27:27.200 --> 27:28.380]  I think you should have that.
[27:28.920 --> 27:30.380]  I don't want to pay for it.
[27:30.460 --> 27:31.360]  That's a lot of money.
[27:31.660 --> 27:36.200]  If somebody buys it, can you just make it go to our Patreon?
[27:36.620 --> 27:37.500]  I don't care which one.
[27:37.560 --> 27:38.440]  Everybody's been standing for that.
[27:38.680 --> 27:39.120]  That's a big ask.
[27:39.880 --> 27:43.980]  It's $1,000 and then $2,600 to renew.
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.060]  That's outrageous.
[27:45.200 --> 27:46.360]  That's ludicrous.
[27:46.360 --> 27:47.880]  That's fucking crazy.
[27:47.980 --> 27:48.560]  You could buy it.
[27:48.660 --> 27:49.740]  That's a tuxedo right there.
[27:49.800 --> 27:50.880]  Why? It's great.
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.640]  Eric.info, same name, different extension, sold for over $5,000.
[27:57.360 --> 27:58.340]  This info's.
[27:58.820 --> 28:01.880]  But Eric.info fucking sucks.
[28:02.100 --> 28:03.600]  Eric.sucks is way better.
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.860]  Yeah, you can buy half of Caster Troy's pistols for that amount.
[28:08.020 --> 28:10.880]  Here's one that's ericdrains.com.
[28:10.980 --> 28:13.000]  And I don't like the way that sounds.
[28:13.520 --> 28:14.640]  What? No.
[28:14.640 --> 28:16.380]  Eric.drains.com.
[28:16.380 --> 28:18.100]  So speaking about the smut conference.
[28:19.540 --> 28:22.380]  It's like people, it's like we should design our website
[28:22.380 --> 28:25.800]  based on those grids on that map thing you showed us last week.
[28:25.800 --> 28:26.420]  Oh, God.
[28:26.820 --> 28:27.580]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[28:27.760 --> 28:28.500]  What? Three words?
[28:28.780 --> 28:29.180]  Yeah. Three.
[28:29.260 --> 28:29.920]  What was it? Three what?
[28:30.200 --> 28:30.340]  Yeah.
[28:31.760 --> 28:32.820]  Hey, what's uh.
[28:33.160 --> 28:35.680]  What's everybody's Doberman count from the last episode?
[28:36.020 --> 28:36.660]  Zero. I got one.
[28:36.780 --> 28:37.460]  One for me.
[28:37.700 --> 28:38.220]  Saw one yesterday.
[28:38.760 --> 28:40.700]  You're really focused in on all things dogs.
[28:41.540 --> 28:42.480]  I guess I am.
[28:42.480 --> 28:43.140]  Dog era.
[28:43.420 --> 28:44.780]  Dog days of summer, bud.
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.100]  It's the dog days.
[28:46.380 --> 28:47.060]  Dog days of summer.
[28:47.500 --> 28:47.760]  That's right.
[28:48.480 --> 28:51.120]  I, uh, I also saw something super gross
[28:51.860 --> 28:54.160]  that I'd like to share with you guys, if you don't mind.
[28:54.960 --> 28:55.360]  Perfect.
[28:55.840 --> 28:56.060]  Yeah.
[28:56.580 --> 28:59.600]  Well, first off, I'll say I was hanging out with Gavin for a little bit yesterday,
[28:59.740 --> 29:01.680]  which we should talk about at some point.
[29:01.700 --> 29:06.700]  But on the way to go record the that Clutch My Pearls podcast
[29:06.700 --> 29:09.400]  where we revealed our smut to the world,
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.360]  Gavin and I saw a dude walk down the street
[29:13.360 --> 29:18.080]  and we saw 75% of his dick, I'd say,
[29:18.220 --> 29:21.920]  and 100% of his pubic hair as his pants were just
[29:21.920 --> 29:25.140]  just barely hanging on to the bell end of his dick.
[29:25.340 --> 29:27.200]  It was like bird's nest and neck.
[29:27.680 --> 29:29.300]  Yeah, it was pretty gross.
[29:29.380 --> 29:30.340]  He didn't give a fuck.
[29:31.040 --> 29:34.720]  But that was the least gross nudity I saw.
[29:34.860 --> 29:38.360]  The other day, Emily and I were going to the there's a Target downtown.
[29:39.280 --> 29:41.500]  Typically, you don't go to it because it's kind of hard to get in and out of
[29:41.960 --> 29:45.740]  like a city target, you know, but she bought something and it was there.
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.560]  So we had to pick it up.
[29:46.760 --> 29:51.120]  And so we're we're going through the east side and we stop at a light.
[29:51.340 --> 29:55.200]  And across the street from us is it's kind of like where there's
[29:55.620 --> 29:56.620]  there's like a soup kitchen.
[29:56.740 --> 29:58.060]  So there's a lot of like
[29:59.520 --> 30:00.640]  people hanging around,
[30:01.560 --> 30:03.940]  you know, just kind of waiting to get to get like a free meal or something.
[30:04.300 --> 30:07.960]  And there was a lady standing, I guess, across the street
[30:07.960 --> 30:10.480]  from us on the other to the right of us, so catty corner to us.
[30:11.620 --> 30:14.100]  And I was in driver's seat, just kind of minding my own business.
[30:14.220 --> 30:15.860]  And Emily goes, oh, oh, my.
[30:15.940 --> 30:21.220]  And I looked over and the lady was smoking a cigarette in her right hand.
[30:21.440 --> 30:25.460]  And then she just pulled her pants down all the way to the ground.
[30:25.680 --> 30:29.400]  Oh, God. And then she squatted with her butt facing the street.
[30:30.080 --> 30:34.220]  And then she just started shitting and smoking a cigarette.
[30:34.520 --> 30:36.260]  And then I shit you not.
[30:37.070 --> 30:40.820]  I was weird. Yeah, I think you're not.
[30:41.320 --> 30:45.200]  She picks up a newspaper off the ground and she started reading the newspaper
[30:45.200 --> 30:49.340]  with her left hand and smoking with her right hand
[30:49.340 --> 30:51.840]  and shitting with her butt hand.
[30:51.940 --> 30:56.300]  And she just squatted there with her ass facing us and the whole street
[30:56.300 --> 30:58.280]  and just shit for a while.
[30:58.280 --> 31:00.200]  And it was a long red light.
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.680]  And then after a minute in one of the
[31:03.680 --> 31:08.760]  ballsiest things I've ever seen a human being do without like even breaking
[31:08.760 --> 31:13.200]  her stride, mid cigarette drag, mid like reading the paper.
[31:13.520 --> 31:17.760]  She just took that paper and then just started wiping her ass with it
[31:17.760 --> 31:22.280]  and then just left it there and then picked up another piece of newspaper
[31:22.280 --> 31:23.940]  and started reading that.
[31:24.440 --> 31:26.460]  Light turns green. We drove on.
[31:27.260 --> 31:29.840]  Went a couple blocks down, got stopped by a train.
[31:30.060 --> 31:32.620]  I'm going to illustrate this to show the passage of time.
[31:32.620 --> 31:35.720]  Got stopped by a like a train, one of those light rails.
[31:36.460 --> 31:38.700]  Get past that. Turn into Target.
[31:38.820 --> 31:39.960]  This is a target in the city.
[31:40.040 --> 31:44.060]  So you got to go down into a parking garage, take a ticket, park,
[31:44.200 --> 31:47.760]  go to an elevator, go up into the Target, get the thing that you bought,
[31:48.040 --> 31:52.020]  get your parking validated, go back down, go back out through the parking lot,
[31:52.400 --> 31:54.080]  show the ticket, get out. Right.
[31:54.120 --> 31:55.120]  So I had to go through all of that.
[31:55.180 --> 31:58.880]  So at a minimum, we were probably 40 minutes at this point. Right.
[31:59.500 --> 32:02.540]  It's the yeah, the Target Whole Foods combo at like East 5th Street.
[32:03.860 --> 32:08.840]  And come back out, go back the way we came, drive the other way past that lady.
[32:09.020 --> 32:13.180]  She was standing, smoking a cigarette, reading the paper
[32:13.180 --> 32:16.360]  still just with her pants down and just her ass out,
[32:16.600 --> 32:19.960]  just like hanging out, chilling, and it had been probably 40 minutes.
[32:19.960 --> 32:23.600]  So I think that lady's pants had been down for a solid 40, 45 minutes
[32:23.600 --> 32:26.640]  at that point, and they weren't in any danger of going back up.
[32:26.640 --> 32:29.160]  And then we just drove on and went about our business.
[32:29.300 --> 32:32.460]  But that that's one of the wildest things I've seen since I saw
[32:32.460 --> 32:34.540]  the homeless guy smoke crack and shit his pants
[32:34.540 --> 32:37.400]  and not break a stride in San Francisco with Gus.
[32:39.200 --> 32:42.960]  I think I've learned to not judge what is and is not an Olympic sport.
[32:43.060 --> 32:45.640]  But to me, that sounds like an Olympian right there.
[32:46.340 --> 32:47.640]  That's genuinely impressive.
[32:48.080 --> 32:48.760]  It was impressive.
[32:48.920 --> 32:51.820]  I don't know if I could squat and shit without falling over
[32:51.820 --> 32:53.700]  into my own shit at this point, you know?
[32:53.700 --> 32:56.920]  Like, I don't know that I have the dexterity to maintain that position
[32:56.920 --> 32:57.900]  for as long as she did.
[32:58.260 --> 33:02.520]  Certainly not while smoking a cigarette and reading the paper in public.
[33:03.160 --> 33:06.800]  You know, because you're still legs tied together by the undies, right?
[33:06.880 --> 33:08.140]  And the shorts and all that.
[33:08.280 --> 33:09.120]  Or like pants.
[33:09.200 --> 33:12.680]  She had like what looked like hospital gown or something like drawstring pants.
[33:12.780 --> 33:13.280]  Maybe they weren't hospital pants.
[33:13.280 --> 33:16.200]  I'd be so paranoid about shitting on my waistband.
[33:17.600 --> 33:20.820]  I probably would have been weirded out by doing it in front of people
[33:20.820 --> 33:22.320]  first and foremost.
[33:22.320 --> 33:26.600]  But like this lady had a bravado about her that I got to say I respected.
[33:27.840 --> 33:31.360]  And she was unfazed and unbothered and just like
[33:31.360 --> 33:35.740]  she knew what she wanted to do in the moment and nothing
[33:35.740 --> 33:37.280]  and no one was going to stop her.
[33:37.400 --> 33:40.600]  And when she was done, she didn't feel like picking her pants back up.
[33:40.800 --> 33:41.880]  And so she didn't have to.
[33:41.960 --> 33:45.720]  And for all I know, if I went by that corner right now,
[33:45.760 --> 33:48.240]  she'd be standing there. I don't know. Crazy.
[33:48.740 --> 33:53.920]  You don't expect to see a human pooping at you in the street. No.
[33:54.820 --> 33:57.000]  And I feel like they absorb that newspaper.
[33:57.480 --> 34:00.960]  I can't prove that they did, but I just feel like I know that they
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.720]  whatever they read, they they could be quizzed on it.
[34:04.840 --> 34:05.760]  Dude, they were reading.
[34:05.820 --> 34:06.700]  She was reading the newspaper.
[34:06.900 --> 34:11.040]  I'm telling you, it was like she was like fucking reading it.
[34:11.060 --> 34:11.900]  She was following it.
[34:11.900 --> 34:14.440]  It was she was she had no care in the world.
[34:14.480 --> 34:16.560]  She was Al Bundy. It was fucking wild.
[34:16.560 --> 34:21.300]  I feel like the anus gets a bad rap for public indecency.
[34:21.620 --> 34:24.380]  Like, I understand why maybe you shouldn't have your penis
[34:25.300 --> 34:28.100]  out when it's erect in public.
[34:28.500 --> 34:29.460]  It's more of a sexual thing.
[34:29.480 --> 34:31.340]  I don't understand. Maybe?
[34:32.400 --> 34:34.900]  Yeah, you do understand that. That's good. That's good.
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.620]  Yeah. It's good that you figured that one out.
[34:38.100 --> 34:39.560]  I think the qualifier is odd.
[34:40.140 --> 34:44.220]  Well, what is the fact that you you mentioned it needs to be erect?
[34:44.220 --> 34:46.400]  I think you could have just stopped that penis out.
[34:46.640 --> 34:47.360]  I agree.
[34:47.800 --> 34:50.460]  Well, a penis pissing is so much less offensive than.
[34:51.460 --> 34:52.500]  Well, anyway, I.
[34:53.420 --> 34:55.000]  Well, I. OK, yeah.
[34:55.100 --> 34:56.820]  Hey, you know what? Keep going.
[34:57.120 --> 35:02.700]  But an anus, I think, shouldn't have the same shock value as a penis.
[35:03.120 --> 35:04.680]  I don't think it does. Really?
[35:05.180 --> 35:06.680]  No. Huh.
[35:07.120 --> 35:08.520]  I don't I don't think they're equal.
[35:09.160 --> 35:11.980]  I think you get arrested for either if they were out. Yeah.
[35:12.500 --> 35:16.560]  Well, there was nobody arrested in this lady and she was out for about an hour.
[35:17.220 --> 35:20.600]  But but my point is, is that sometimes people need to shit
[35:20.600 --> 35:23.220]  like it's a food poisoning emergency or you're ill.
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.600]  You just need to whip it down and take a dump.
[35:25.980 --> 35:29.120]  You never need to whip out your erect penis is my point.
[35:29.620 --> 35:31.740]  Totally acceptable of a dog, does it? Right.
[35:32.480 --> 35:32.980]  That's what I mean.
[35:33.180 --> 35:34.220]  See all the time in the animal kingdom.
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.180]  Yeah. You get arrested for either thing is such a bad defense
[35:38.780 --> 35:41.800]  because it implies that like there isn't a scale that
[35:41.980 --> 35:44.800]  being arrested is the max of anything.
[35:45.460 --> 35:46.880]  Uh, what do you mean?
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.300]  You could be arrested for anything, but there are different crimes.
[35:51.400 --> 35:52.940]  Can't be arrested for throwing up.
[35:54.840 --> 35:56.300]  Maybe if you throw up on a cop.
[35:56.740 --> 35:57.620]  Yeah. Throw up on a cop.
[35:57.920 --> 35:58.620]  Yeah, or a baby.
[35:59.200 --> 36:01.480]  Or a baby. Someone else's baby.
[36:01.680 --> 36:08.000]  My point is, is that like tax evasion and genocide are not the same crimes.
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.300]  Right. But you could be arrested for both.
[36:10.800 --> 36:13.500]  I don't think you just get normal arrested for genocide.
[36:16.260 --> 36:17.600]  I don't think you get red.
[36:17.700 --> 36:20.060]  Your Miranda's in the back of the car. You're coming down to county lockup.
[36:21.420 --> 36:24.300]  Everything you say can be used against you.
[36:25.340 --> 36:27.960]  I place you under arrest right now.
[36:27.960 --> 36:31.780]  My point was, Gavin, I said that I think that there is a lot less
[36:32.500 --> 36:34.760]  with the ass out than there is a dick out.
[36:34.860 --> 36:36.140]  I think it's a lot less offensive.
[36:36.340 --> 36:40.100]  And your argument was, well, you could be arrested if your ass was out.
[36:40.300 --> 36:42.320]  And I'm just saying, I think there's levels to the game,
[36:42.540 --> 36:45.320]  even though like you could fall under the category of, yeah,
[36:45.340 --> 36:46.340]  you could be arrested for both.
[36:46.560 --> 36:47.780]  Does not make them equal.
[36:48.280 --> 36:49.000]  Is what I was trying to...
[36:49.000 --> 36:49.480]  How are they?
[36:50.980 --> 36:53.320]  Well, how are they not equal if you can get arrested for both?
[36:53.420 --> 36:56.500]  Like in what arenas outside of the law are they unequal?
[36:57.160 --> 37:00.460]  I think if we did a... Nick, get that survey going.
[37:01.180 --> 37:02.760]  Get the survey post going.
[37:03.500 --> 37:04.260]  Yeah, this is good.
[37:04.360 --> 37:05.460]  What do you what do you want him to write?
[37:05.640 --> 37:07.560]  He'll he'll post this one, too, like his corn dog.
[37:08.320 --> 37:10.600]  Like what's more shocking or like a...
[37:10.600 --> 37:13.020]  Yeah, what what is what is more offensive?
[37:14.700 --> 37:17.760]  Dick out, butt out or equally offensive.
[37:18.700 --> 37:21.680]  Now we specify how erect the penis is.
[37:21.780 --> 37:23.340]  No, I don't think we need to.
[37:23.620 --> 37:24.720]  And are we adding vagina?
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.840]  It seems weird to specify how erect the penis would be because there's no...
[37:28.840 --> 37:31.060]  What's the butthole equivalent of an erect penis?
[37:31.820 --> 37:37.260]  Well, if someone was using a uridal next to you with a full blown stalk on,
[37:37.720 --> 37:40.860]  that would be much more shocking than if someone was just taking a piss.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.100]  I don't think it would be.
[37:42.400 --> 37:43.920]  I think I'd be equally uncomfortable.
[37:44.520 --> 37:48.840]  Well, I just think like like it's like you see somebody with an asshole out in public.
[37:49.140 --> 37:50.420]  They're probably pooping, right?
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.780]  Like in the instance that I saw the asshole, it was pooping.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.840]  You see a penis out in public.
[37:55.260 --> 38:00.740]  Chances are it's peeing, which would be different than seeing an erect penis.
[38:01.140 --> 38:04.240]  But I think the one to one comparison, because in this situation,
[38:04.300 --> 38:06.300]  the lady was pooping, would be a peeing penis.
[38:07.020 --> 38:10.200]  But but then that's not nearly as offensive as an erect penis,
[38:10.280 --> 38:11.640]  which is more interesting to talk about.
[38:11.940 --> 38:14.100]  So what would be the butthole equivalent of erect penis?
[38:14.140 --> 38:16.180]  I think it would have to be like a gaping butthole,
[38:16.180 --> 38:17.740]  like you were holding your butthole open.
[38:18.140 --> 38:19.060]  Or a finger in the ass.
[38:19.200 --> 38:21.800]  Oh, like a finger in the ass. Yeah, maybe that.
[38:23.100 --> 38:24.540]  Nick, can you write all this down for your Twitter?
[38:24.920 --> 38:25.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:25.560 --> 38:28.140]  I will say that Nick was ready to post this.
[38:28.260 --> 38:33.200]  And then the erectness of the penis made him hold up for posting it.
[38:34.220 --> 38:36.900]  So there's there might be something to it.
[38:37.000 --> 38:37.460]  That, yeah.
[38:38.240 --> 38:40.820]  You know what? Yeah, that's it.
[38:41.420 --> 38:43.080]  I just feel like there's going to be leniency
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.480]  if the cop knows that you have food poisoning.
[38:45.940 --> 38:47.000]  Did you say cock or cup?
[38:48.000 --> 38:48.680]  What? What?
[38:52.640 --> 38:54.740]  Oh, I had bad oysters. I'm going to shoot.
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.440]  Anyway, let us know in the comments of this video
[39:13.440 --> 39:14.680]  which is more offensive.
[39:17.260 --> 39:21.940]  What is offensive is all this slander I've been hearing from Gavin
[39:22.630 --> 39:24.240]  about Beverly Hills Cop 3.
[39:25.320 --> 39:26.980]  So you've now watched them, right?
[39:27.380 --> 39:28.580]  I've seen everyone now.
[39:28.640 --> 39:30.280]  Yeah, I've watched all four films.
[39:30.800 --> 39:33.200]  Not a good movie, Beverly Hills Cop 3.
[39:33.620 --> 39:38.280]  But I I didn't know at the time, but I stand by the fact that I'm right.
[39:38.720 --> 39:42.900]  I think Beverly Hills Cop 3 is the best action scenes in that entire series.
[39:42.900 --> 39:45.960]  When you told me this on Slack, what did I type back to you?
[39:46.020 --> 39:47.960]  You're a fucking idiot, I believe is what you said.
[39:48.480 --> 39:49.120]  And then?
[39:50.060 --> 39:50.940]  I don't remember.
[39:51.020 --> 39:52.900]  You seem to have all this in your mind.
[39:52.960 --> 39:53.440]  Why don't you say?
[39:54.060 --> 39:55.820]  I wrote respectfully afterwards.
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.200]  Oh, respectfully, yeah, that's right.
[39:59.260 --> 40:01.260]  I dropped that for my bread.
[40:02.360 --> 40:06.380]  He told us earlier today that his made up opinion became his real opinion.
[40:06.860 --> 40:08.180]  After he watched it, it didn't make any sense.
[40:08.960 --> 40:12.080]  There's maybe I could say some of the action's good ways
[40:12.080 --> 40:14.560]  like hopping about on the Ferris wheel, but it's not.
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.940]  The best kill in the entire series happens in three by far.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.240]  I'm an idol and it's part of the best sequence in the whole movie.
[40:22.300 --> 40:24.420]  I don't know. Listen, maybe you're on your phone.
[40:24.560 --> 40:26.420]  Maybe you weren't giving it the attention you deserve.
[40:26.620 --> 40:27.180]  I'm never on my phone.
[40:27.300 --> 40:31.240]  But the opening shootout with the cars
[40:31.240 --> 40:35.700]  where it goes from the cars to the shootout to the car driving sequence.
[40:36.120 --> 40:37.380]  Best sequence in the movie.
[40:37.760 --> 40:38.620]  I think it's funny.
[40:38.680 --> 40:40.060]  I like that his airbag goes off.
[40:40.100 --> 40:41.400]  You don't see that many chases.
[40:41.400 --> 40:44.320]  I like that the car takes real damage.
[40:44.660 --> 40:48.200]  And there's a scene where he fucking runs over a guy
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.080]  like he shoots the guy that falls out of a truck and he hits a dummy with his car.
[40:53.500 --> 40:55.760]  And it's it is graphic.
[40:56.280 --> 41:00.440]  God, there's a fucking I'm not going to spoil it for Gavin, but there's a dude.
[41:00.560 --> 41:03.540]  There's a run over scene at the end of The Sopranos that I saw the other night
[41:03.540 --> 41:04.780]  that fucking grossed me out.
[41:04.840 --> 41:05.700]  I did not expect coming.
[41:06.780 --> 41:10.200]  It's so funny that you're watching The Sopranos for the first time.
[41:10.620 --> 41:11.260]  No, not me.
[41:11.260 --> 41:12.000]  I've seen it before.
[41:12.160 --> 41:14.380]  I just had never watched the last four episodes.
[41:14.800 --> 41:16.500]  Oh, Emily's first time.
[41:16.540 --> 41:17.220]  Wow. Got it.
[41:17.900 --> 41:19.820]  You just got all the way and then you went close enough.
[41:20.260 --> 41:21.400]  Yeah, I read it on Wikipedia.
[41:21.540 --> 41:22.180]  I got sick of waiting.
[41:23.120 --> 41:23.880]  I get it.
[41:24.300 --> 41:27.540]  That show completely turned me off that the last season with how long they took.
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.280]  I think I think if you were watching it in real time, it would be like lost
[41:31.280 --> 41:33.100]  where you're just like, I'm going insane waiting for this.
[41:33.200 --> 41:34.260]  Yeah, it was fucking bullshit.
[41:34.300 --> 41:35.660]  The last two seasons were rough.
[41:35.740 --> 41:40.020]  They took like extended breaks and AJ and Meadow
[41:40.020 --> 41:42.540]  were growing about five years season to season.
[41:43.100 --> 41:47.280]  AJ had gray hair by the time the fucking last season rolled around.
[41:47.380 --> 41:47.860]  It's insane.
[41:48.300 --> 41:49.140]  It took so long. It's tough.
[41:49.460 --> 41:49.860]  It's tough.
[41:50.240 --> 41:53.920]  It was insane watching Axel F, though, because I finally watched that one.
[41:54.260 --> 41:57.840]  Yeah. And watching what looks like the exact same Eddie Murphy
[41:58.380 --> 42:01.000]  next to a bunch of graying old dudes.
[42:01.220 --> 42:01.740]  It's insane.
[42:05.240 --> 42:09.240]  I think the fourth one is the worst one, in my opinion.
[42:10.020 --> 42:11.200]  No, I didn't like it at all.
[42:12.180 --> 42:13.100]  No, I didn't see.
[42:13.480 --> 42:15.160]  No. And the fourth one is real bad.
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.200]  It had some nice callbacks that it was done in a not.
[42:18.520 --> 42:20.180]  You don't get credit for callbacks.
[42:21.040 --> 42:23.220]  What? You don't get credit for callbacks.
[42:23.320 --> 42:24.300]  Callbacks are so lazy.
[42:24.700 --> 42:26.000]  I don't give points for callbacks.
[42:26.440 --> 42:28.280]  I mean, it's a 30 year time gap.
[42:28.340 --> 42:30.180]  I think that's I think we deserve a cheeky.
[42:30.380 --> 42:31.040]  Oh, you get fuck.
[42:31.140 --> 42:34.780]  I'm going to give you three points because you say, oh, did he take you to a strip club?
[42:35.280 --> 42:36.220]  You don't get points for that.
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.480]  Dude, callbacks are half of this fucking podcast.
[42:39.480 --> 42:43.480]  Like, don't don't shit on all we got going for us.
[42:43.500 --> 42:45.300]  How are your ankles percentage wise?
[42:45.920 --> 42:48.220]  Pretty good. 99%.
[42:49.340 --> 42:55.300]  Speaking of callbacks, I do want to call back to a fan who,
[42:56.080 --> 42:59.020]  if you remember, sunburned himself.
[43:00.020 --> 43:00.900]  Oh, yeah.
[43:01.400 --> 43:05.800]  This is this is Jake Jarvis Farm D.
[43:06.460 --> 43:09.140]  Yeah. He also did something recently because he's been
[43:09.140 --> 43:11.300]  practicing tattooing himself.
[43:12.400 --> 43:16.000]  So on his own leg, he gave himself an Ian.
[43:16.460 --> 43:18.860]  And I think it's you know, it's pretty it's it's decent.
[43:18.940 --> 43:19.780]  You know, good for him.
[43:19.900 --> 43:21.840]  It looks about as good as mine. Yeah, that's great.
[43:22.020 --> 43:24.820]  Hey, hey, he gave himself the pencil also.
[43:24.960 --> 43:26.080]  I think the pencil looks great.
[43:26.400 --> 43:28.220]  Yeah, sure does. Number 16 pencil.
[43:28.700 --> 43:32.060]  At the same time, his what he is described as
[43:32.960 --> 43:35.660]  I got some regulation podcast tattoos.
[43:35.660 --> 43:40.320]  My younger brother tattooed my left butt cheek with regulation
[43:40.320 --> 43:43.200]  Tanner to make it a permanent thing in my life now.
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.600]  And that's not real.
[43:47.640 --> 43:50.160]  I think that that's an insane tattoo to get.
[43:50.360 --> 43:51.940]  And I wasn't sure how to feel about it.
[43:52.040 --> 43:54.780]  And then Emily showed me the thread and was like, do you see this?
[43:54.780 --> 43:55.360]  And I was like, yeah.
[43:55.360 --> 43:57.860]  And she goes, these kids, they like to have fun.
[43:58.080 --> 43:58.780]  They're good kids.
[43:58.780 --> 44:01.240]  And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess so. That's a good point.
[44:01.400 --> 44:03.100]  She's like, I like them. They're up to good.
[44:03.140 --> 44:03.860]  They're having fun.
[44:03.880 --> 44:05.460]  And I was like, that's a great point.
[44:05.460 --> 44:06.900]  They're having a hell of a good time.
[44:07.220 --> 44:09.440]  I let a friend give me a stick and poke tattoo.
[44:09.660 --> 44:11.960]  Like, dude, that's cool.
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.920]  Why not? Gavin's nose on my fucking shin for Christ's sake.
[44:15.020 --> 44:15.720]  Sure. Exactly.
[44:15.880 --> 44:18.720]  So what's you know, I see this stuff and I just go, fuck it.
[44:18.820 --> 44:19.360]  Go for it.
[44:19.440 --> 44:20.820]  Regulation, Tanner on your ass.
[44:21.060 --> 44:23.160]  Life's so big. It's so big.
[44:23.260 --> 44:24.320]  I'm so it's huge.
[44:24.380 --> 44:26.420]  It's huge. And it's on his ass.
[44:26.920 --> 44:28.240]  Huge on his ass.
[44:28.800 --> 44:30.220]  Axel Foley on the other side.
[44:30.620 --> 44:32.280]  Really bring both cheeks together.
[44:32.800 --> 44:36.060]  And I'll be honest, the gap between the end and the T is pretty sizable.
[44:37.940 --> 44:42.520]  Yeah, there's some spacey issues for sure. Regulae, Cheon, Tanner.
[44:44.260 --> 44:46.880]  Well, these guys have a fan anemone for sure.
[44:47.020 --> 44:48.340]  Yeah, I think they're awesome.
[44:48.400 --> 44:50.400]  I'm a big fan of insane people.
[44:50.540 --> 44:51.360]  So I think this is great.
[44:51.820 --> 44:54.420]  You just can tell that guy is going to be fun if you bump into him.
[44:54.700 --> 44:55.440]  And 100 percent.
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.040]  That's a dude. That's a dude who's getting up to some good stuff.
[45:00.760 --> 45:01.920]  I don't know if it's good stuff,
[45:01.920 --> 45:02.880]  but he's getting up to stuff.
[45:05.300 --> 45:06.900]  You're not bored hanging out with him.
[45:10.220 --> 45:12.660]  Oh, Regulation Sitter would make more sense, I think.
[45:13.300 --> 45:16.900]  Well, oh, Tanner isn't a name.
[45:17.280 --> 45:20.140]  Oh, he's got a tan because he got a tan.
[45:20.220 --> 45:21.740]  He's the tan guy. I get it.
[45:21.780 --> 45:23.180]  It also wasn't a tan.
[45:23.840 --> 45:26.000]  It was a burn. It was a sunburn.
[45:26.260 --> 45:27.920]  Didn't you just say it was called Jarvis?
[45:28.420 --> 45:30.260]  Yeah, it's like Jake Jarvis something.
[45:30.260 --> 45:32.360]  I thought maybe his brother's name was Tanner.
[45:32.720 --> 45:34.540]  I didn't consider...
[45:34.540 --> 45:36.900]  I didn't consider Tanner being a thing.
[45:37.280 --> 45:39.860]  You put four pictures ago, you posted a picture of a tan.
[45:41.260 --> 45:41.700]  That's a sunburn.
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.400]  Would you call that a tan?
[45:43.780 --> 45:46.040]  Well, it's going to be more tan than the tapes off.
[45:46.820 --> 45:50.240]  OK, I don't think I'd look at that and go, yeah, check out this guy's tan.
[45:50.500 --> 45:53.020]  Yeah. Like, what are you talking about?
[45:54.300 --> 45:56.100]  Dude, look at how tan this guy is.
[45:57.820 --> 46:00.220]  Look at his fucking bright red back.
[46:00.460 --> 46:02.400]  Look at how tan he is, dude.
[46:05.280 --> 46:06.780]  What a legend.
[46:07.840 --> 46:08.620]  Gross, Gavin.
[46:09.340 --> 46:11.000]  Sorry. That's all right.
[46:12.060 --> 46:13.220]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[46:13.620 --> 46:17.480]  How long do you think the fax machine will still exist?
[46:18.180 --> 46:19.140]  Forever, right?
[46:19.300 --> 46:21.120]  Like, it's never going to go away.
[46:21.440 --> 46:25.120]  And I feel like it's still used in the places
[46:25.120 --> 46:26.740]  that should be using it the least.
[46:26.940 --> 46:29.540]  It's being used by like hospitals and stuff.
[46:29.960 --> 46:35.120]  Like doctors send faxes to offices and financial shit.
[46:35.480 --> 46:39.180]  At what point did the email get invented and a bunch of industries just went,
[46:39.740 --> 46:41.240]  no, not for me.
[46:41.640 --> 46:45.200]  I ran into a need for a fax last week for some personal financial stuff.
[46:45.260 --> 46:49.980]  And I was just thinking, I just caught myself thinking like still like 2024.
[46:51.460 --> 46:53.980]  And there's no indication that it's going away.
[46:53.980 --> 46:57.880]  Like, do you remember when analog TV went away and they were like for like a year
[46:57.880 --> 46:59.720]  and a half, they were you were always seeing.
[47:00.060 --> 47:01.580]  Yeah. Prep in the world for it.
[47:02.020 --> 47:02.980]  Notices everywhere. Yeah.
[47:03.000 --> 47:03.820]  Like, hey, be ready.
[47:03.920 --> 47:05.460]  We're turning the signals off, turn the signals off.
[47:05.520 --> 47:08.460]  It's you're not nobody's going like, hey, just everybody be aware.
[47:08.660 --> 47:12.260]  10 year countdown, five year countdown till we're done with fax machines,
[47:12.340 --> 47:15.620]  which tells me they're going to be around for fucking ever.
[47:15.980 --> 47:19.000]  How did how do we escape the virus?
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.100]  That is the facts. We don't.
[47:21.560 --> 47:27.240]  Do they still make like I assume companies still make their most recent fax machine,
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.380]  but are they innovating on the fax machine still?
[47:29.520 --> 47:31.540]  Like, is there a 2024 fax machine?
[47:31.980 --> 47:35.720]  You know, I wonder that about printers, too, because my printer broke
[47:35.720 --> 47:38.800]  a while back at the old house and I went and bought a new one.
[47:38.920 --> 47:43.840]  And I realized I bought the exact same model printer, but four years apart.
[47:43.920 --> 47:46.020]  And I thought, oh, they're not making new printers anymore.
[47:46.300 --> 47:48.120]  We probably hit peak printer technology.
[47:48.120 --> 47:51.180]  And now it's just like, you know, you get a new color way every once in a while.
[47:51.560 --> 47:54.880]  I mean, as someone who's printed never freaking works, maybe they should keep
[47:55.340 --> 47:57.760]  innovating. Yeah, I agree.
[47:58.460 --> 48:01.300]  That's a good question. Are there new fax technologies?
[48:03.580 --> 48:05.740]  Are scientists still innovating with fax?
[48:05.740 --> 48:09.360]  Because it's always like, like HDMI gets an update every few years.
[48:09.400 --> 48:12.260]  They'll be like, oh, it's HDMI 2.1 now.
[48:12.660 --> 48:14.280]  Has there ever been fax 2?
[48:14.980 --> 48:17.180]  Wait, Geoff, what did you what did you just search?
[48:17.180 --> 48:18.620]  Did scientists what?
[48:19.240 --> 48:21.900]  Are scientists still innovating the fax machine?
[48:25.420 --> 48:27.780]  I thought that would be a funny way to search it.
[48:28.020 --> 48:30.860]  I know you nailed it, but I know it's not scientists.
[48:31.120 --> 48:32.120]  It's fucking great.
[48:32.360 --> 48:33.740]  It's I'm a scientist.
[48:33.940 --> 48:35.000]  Oh, what kind of science do you do?
[48:35.180 --> 48:36.620]  Fax, fax, fax,
[48:38.940 --> 48:40.880]  mimeograph and fax related science.
[48:41.480 --> 48:44.100]  The fuck this guy's doing like 1980s science.
[48:44.100 --> 48:45.040]  What the shit?
[48:45.040 --> 48:47.860]  Just like that of them pulling scientists off other stuff
[48:47.860 --> 48:49.720]  to go back to the fax machine.
[48:50.440 --> 48:52.320]  You guys remember that movie Weird Science?
[48:52.460 --> 48:53.220]  Yeah, stuff like that.
[48:53.240 --> 48:56.040]  But with a fax machine, it's a PhD in copy.
[48:56.540 --> 48:57.980]  Oh, goddamn.
[48:58.760 --> 49:01.900]  Is there fax 2?
[49:02.820 --> 49:05.600]  I was thinking about this with foods in general.
[49:06.280 --> 49:10.280]  It's crazy that there isn't just like an apple to or like rice to.
[49:11.180 --> 49:14.340]  There isn't a brand that is just saying this is the sequel to this.
[49:15.640 --> 49:16.280]  Toast 2.
[49:17.080 --> 49:19.100]  We had a sequels thing once, didn't we?
[49:20.080 --> 49:21.960]  Best sequels. Best sequels, yeah.
[49:22.840 --> 49:23.880]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[49:23.960 --> 49:26.160]  The best sequels one was that that was a really good one.
[49:26.380 --> 49:30.060]  We had the the clapper in there, I think, was a sequel to the light switch.
[49:33.280 --> 49:35.080]  That was before we were even doing drafts.
[49:35.100 --> 49:37.520]  I think that was just a topic that we had on the show.
[49:37.560 --> 49:39.040]  Yeah, I don't remember that being a draft.
[49:39.180 --> 49:39.980]  That'd be a good draft.
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.120]  That would be a good draft.
[49:42.180 --> 49:43.740]  Oh, I want it. Yeah, I wanted it.
[49:43.740 --> 49:44.840]  I have one on my list, actually.
[49:44.920 --> 49:46.260]  This is different because that could be anything.
[49:46.700 --> 49:48.560]  But I wanted to do best third movie.
[49:50.760 --> 49:51.980]  Oh, historically awful.
[49:52.440 --> 49:53.760]  Yeah, historically awful films.
[49:53.820 --> 49:55.180]  But there's got to be a few that are good.
[49:55.420 --> 49:57.380]  You know, there's got there's got to be some.
[49:57.620 --> 49:58.600]  Godfather 3 sucks.
[49:58.700 --> 49:59.800]  Matrix 3 sucks.
[50:00.460 --> 50:01.680]  Die Hard 3 is great.
[50:01.780 --> 50:02.740]  Die Hard 3 is great.
[50:03.680 --> 50:04.460]  Is it great?
[50:04.740 --> 50:07.040]  Yeah, I mean, it's better than it's better than two.
[50:07.160 --> 50:08.480]  Better than two, not better than one, though.
[50:08.560 --> 50:09.580]  It's no, it's definitely not better than one.
[50:09.640 --> 50:10.420]  But it's good.
[50:11.020 --> 50:14.800]  Alien 3 is probably the second best in the franchise.
[50:15.360 --> 50:17.620]  The third Quiet Place movie, I think, is the best.
[50:18.000 --> 50:19.200]  Third Mission Impossible is awesome.
[50:19.620 --> 50:22.440]  That that's the one I was about to ask about was the Philip Seymour.
[50:22.940 --> 50:24.680]  Yeah, it's the one I lost my car in.
[50:24.760 --> 50:25.580]  Yeah, the rabbit's foot.
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.720]  Yeah, best threes would be an interesting draft.
[50:31.040 --> 50:32.460]  Yeah, that's a really good one.
[50:32.620 --> 50:34.000]  Because none of them are that's tough.
[50:34.980 --> 50:36.880]  Yeah, dude, dude, Terminator 3.
[50:37.100 --> 50:37.560]  Hell yeah.
[50:39.800 --> 50:40.200]  What?
[50:46.880 --> 50:47.680]  Windows three.
[50:47.900 --> 50:48.800]  That's good. We're noting it.
[50:48.920 --> 50:50.320]  I think I think that's a good one.
[50:50.620 --> 50:53.100]  All right. Well, we'll do that in the undefined future at some point.
[50:54.380 --> 50:58.940]  I I was thinking the other day that my dog Albert, you know, the
[50:58.940 --> 51:01.720]  the dog whose name you're all allowed to know now.
[51:02.500 --> 51:04.500]  Little English Bulldog. He's nine months old.
[51:04.940 --> 51:08.220]  We got him from a breeder in Dallas, and then we brought him to Austin.
[51:08.220 --> 51:10.580]  And it struck me over the weekend
[51:10.580 --> 51:14.660]  that Albert has never seen a body of water before.
[51:15.220 --> 51:16.020]  Like we got him.
[51:16.160 --> 51:19.740]  We got him a little splash pad to play around in the backyard, and he loves it.
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.760]  But he's a little tepid about getting in it, you know?
[51:23.060 --> 51:27.060]  And I was thinking, God, I wonder how if he would recognize it as water.
[51:27.300 --> 51:28.960]  Like, would it faze him at all?
[51:29.040 --> 51:29.900]  Would he pay any attention to it?
[51:29.920 --> 51:32.900]  So I took him over the weekend down to Town Lake
[51:33.400 --> 51:34.580]  to like the hike and bike trail.
[51:34.980 --> 51:38.120]  And I walked him over to the edge to see what would happen.
[51:38.660 --> 51:39.660]  And Emily and I did.
[51:39.920 --> 51:40.520]  And we walked him.
[51:40.620 --> 51:42.340]  It was kind of like to get close to the water over there.
[51:42.400 --> 51:45.520]  You kind of got to go down like a little muddy, you know, embankment a little bit.
[51:45.620 --> 51:48.320]  And he was super interested in like smelling the mud.
[51:48.560 --> 51:51.240]  And he kind of like walked down, just kind of smelling the mud
[51:51.240 --> 51:52.620]  and like looking at the dirt and shit.
[51:52.720 --> 51:57.080]  And then he looked up and he saw the water and he jumped his height.
[51:57.740 --> 52:01.500]  He jumped and he jumped a foot in the air.
[52:01.500 --> 52:07.280]  I've never seen a dog so surprised and so shocked in their life.
[52:07.660 --> 52:11.920]  It scared the absolute utter shit out of them.
[52:12.100 --> 52:13.480]  And that was all he needed.
[52:13.560 --> 52:15.660]  He turned around and was like, I'm good.
[52:15.800 --> 52:17.220]  And then I shit you not.
[52:17.640 --> 52:21.180]  Unfortunately, about eight seconds later, Emily went, oh, no.
[52:21.420 --> 52:22.040]  And I went, what?
[52:22.080 --> 52:28.660]  And I looked up to see a fucking snake slithering past us 18, 20 feet in front of us.
[52:28.660 --> 52:33.540]  So I jumped my height about 10 feet in the air and then we got the fuck out of there.
[52:33.720 --> 52:39.060]  But if I just if your animal has never seen a body of water before, just take it.
[52:39.100 --> 52:43.000]  It might it's wild how they might react to it.
[52:43.020 --> 52:44.500]  Do you never wash them in the tub?
[52:45.540 --> 52:47.900]  No, I wash them in the backyard with.
[52:48.240 --> 52:49.520]  No, we've washed them in the tub before.
[52:49.720 --> 52:50.920]  But you don't fill the water up.
[52:50.980 --> 52:54.520]  We have like a little hose, you know, and it's like, yeah, it's getting wet.
[52:54.680 --> 52:57.300]  But yeah, and he gets he gets washed at the groomers.
[52:57.300 --> 53:00.260]  But it's not he's never submersed.
[53:01.120 --> 53:02.240]  What an exciting day.
[53:03.120 --> 53:06.080]  For the dog, I wish I could remember the first time I went to like the beach.
[53:07.300 --> 53:09.120]  So like a large body of water.
[53:10.540 --> 53:14.160]  Yeah, I don't remember trying to process like, yeah, I have zero memory of that.
[53:14.700 --> 53:15.960]  I mean, you grew up around water.
[53:16.080 --> 53:17.940]  Yeah, it was probably pretty early. I did, too.
[53:18.760 --> 53:20.580]  Gavin, do you remember first time you saw an ocean?
[53:21.720 --> 53:22.660]  No, I think I was too young.
[53:23.240 --> 53:26.820]  Yeah, Eric, I'm assuming you were pretty, pretty.
[53:26.820 --> 53:27.800]  I mean, we would just go.
[53:28.120 --> 53:32.160]  Yeah, we were poor people in San Diego, so we just went to the bay.
[53:32.440 --> 53:34.140]  So I remember going to the bay when I was really young.
[53:34.780 --> 53:35.360]  Nick, how about you?
[53:36.380 --> 53:37.280]  I couldn't tell you.
[53:37.540 --> 53:40.340]  It's I probably from a young age, honestly.
[53:41.360 --> 53:44.960]  I was thinking about that the other day, about how many firsts we did
[53:44.960 --> 53:46.660]  don't matter, so you don't remember.
[53:47.040 --> 53:49.480]  Like, I don't remember the first hamburger I ever ate.
[53:50.320 --> 53:51.120]  Why would I, I guess?
[53:51.140 --> 53:55.460]  Yeah, I feel like parents should make a big, bigger deal about firsts of many.
[53:55.960 --> 54:00.460]  You do for like the first year, like we made a baby book
[54:00.460 --> 54:02.620]  and it's like the first food you ever ate.
[54:02.660 --> 54:05.400]  And it's like it was green, strained carrots or whatever.
[54:05.660 --> 54:09.900]  You know, I think it was sweet potatoes, actually, for me, but or yams.
[54:10.120 --> 54:13.380]  But it's all that developmental stuff.
[54:13.460 --> 54:18.520]  But you don't ever be like, I don't know, first pair of tennis shoes
[54:18.520 --> 54:21.940]  you ever wore or first time you rode a skateboard or, you know.
[54:23.100 --> 54:26.000]  First movie I saw, I remember just because it was a big deal to me.
[54:26.040 --> 54:26.940]  It was Fox and the Hound.
[54:27.500 --> 54:31.780]  And it was a it was a twofer.
[54:31.860 --> 54:35.700]  It was Fox and the Hound and the Disney Robin Hood.
[54:36.020 --> 54:37.100]  So it was two foxes.
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.440]  It was Fox, Double Fox Day, Double Fox.
[54:40.700 --> 54:41.720]  Disney Robin Hood.
[54:42.440 --> 54:42.860]  Good movie.
[54:43.460 --> 54:44.200]  It's a good combination.
[54:44.700 --> 54:45.160]  Great movie. Yeah.
[54:45.600 --> 54:47.500]  Were you taken aback, Gavin?
[54:47.900 --> 54:50.580]  And sorry to take it back to Beverly Hills Cop for a moment.
[54:50.580 --> 54:52.160]  When I was committing crimes.
[54:52.360 --> 54:53.340]  Jesus Christ.
[54:53.920 --> 54:54.420]  When you what?
[54:54.580 --> 54:57.800]  When I was committing all the crimes, were you were you taken aback by that?
[54:57.860 --> 54:58.480]  I was shocked.
[54:59.260 --> 55:01.860]  When I was watching it, I went, gee, I did all this.
[55:02.160 --> 55:03.120]  These are all my crimes.
[55:03.600 --> 55:05.340]  Did it not register with you at all?
[55:05.920 --> 55:06.680]  You're watching the movie.
[55:07.720 --> 55:08.860]  I can't believe you didn't have the slot.
[55:09.160 --> 55:11.680]  Look at what the villains wear in the film.
[55:12.520 --> 55:13.660]  I just posted a screenshot.
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.560]  I just kept going like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[55:21.720 --> 55:23.220]  That's, that's crazy.
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.640]  Sorry, Regulation, Tanner's butt.
[55:26.820 --> 55:28.340]  It's going to that's going to be the thumbnail.
[55:28.840 --> 55:32.220]  Dude, that might be the first iteration of the mask.
[55:32.520 --> 55:34.420]  Like, that's crazy.
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.600]  They all are wearing like Rainbow Six Vegas faces, essentially, is and they're
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.200]  it's every one of them wears it.
[55:41.380 --> 55:41.860]  They're unified.
[55:42.100 --> 55:43.640]  We've got a rotoscope, your one.
[55:43.640 --> 55:44.880]  Onto this movie.
[55:45.060 --> 55:45.900]  We should.
[55:46.300 --> 55:47.480]  Oh, that'd be great.
[55:48.920 --> 55:49.480]  Not it.
[55:49.880 --> 55:53.320]  Not well, I don't even know what rotoscope means, so I'm definitely not it.
[55:54.160 --> 55:54.840]  I like it.
[55:55.340 --> 55:57.060]  This is your dock.
[55:57.320 --> 55:58.040]  Did you take this picture?
[55:58.940 --> 55:59.100]  Yeah.
[55:59.680 --> 56:04.720]  You've got stuff on your dock that you don't have installed.
[56:04.900 --> 56:06.180]  You got two question marks.
[56:06.740 --> 56:08.080]  Yeah, I do.
[56:08.640 --> 56:09.600]  Oh, this is good.
[56:09.660 --> 56:10.660]  I'm going to start looking at this.
[56:10.900 --> 56:12.560]  This is this pretty exciting.
[56:12.560 --> 56:14.220]  Let's see what else he's got down here.
[56:14.360 --> 56:18.460]  The one next to photos is an app that's not functional in that operating system.
[56:18.680 --> 56:21.080]  And then he's got two just broken links.
[56:23.020 --> 56:26.320]  Every tiny little corner of your life is a shit show.
[56:27.440 --> 56:28.580]  Which one's photos?
[56:29.620 --> 56:30.140]  What's the?
[56:30.640 --> 56:32.080]  Oh, that's funny.
[56:32.240 --> 56:33.720]  Yeah, I don't know.
[56:33.900 --> 56:34.140]  Yeah.
[56:34.160 --> 56:34.940]  Microsoft Word.
[56:35.060 --> 56:35.920]  I don't have that anymore.
[56:36.360 --> 56:37.360]  Yeah, it doesn't work.
[56:40.060 --> 56:42.000]  I don't even know what a lot of these are.
[56:42.560 --> 56:44.600]  What's the what's the one that's next?
[56:44.840 --> 56:46.940]  It's like two down from audacity to the right.
[56:47.080 --> 56:48.440]  It's next to like the App Store one.
[56:48.520 --> 56:49.940]  It looks like a little like lectern.
[56:50.260 --> 56:51.280]  What is that?
[56:51.320 --> 56:52.020]  A lectern?
[56:52.200 --> 56:53.840]  Oh, is it like a keynote or something?
[56:54.220 --> 56:55.680]  Over all the way over to the right.
[56:56.180 --> 56:57.080]  What is that?
[56:58.860 --> 57:02.120]  The clean my Mac X between the G and the bench?
[57:02.560 --> 57:03.000]  The App Store?
[57:03.140 --> 57:03.680]  Yeah, I don't have.
[57:03.760 --> 57:04.920]  I'm trying to look at my bar.
[57:05.000 --> 57:05.580]  I don't have it.
[57:05.640 --> 57:06.160]  Whatever that is.
[57:06.160 --> 57:06.660]  Oh, yeah, I was.
[57:06.700 --> 57:09.700]  That was when I was just desperately trying to make this Mac run.
[57:09.700 --> 57:11.220]  Well, I was just so.
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.020]  So put more shits on it.
[57:13.080 --> 57:17.760]  You just said, make sure it's on that bar so I can jump on it real quick.
[57:18.040 --> 57:18.620]  Did it work?
[57:18.680 --> 57:19.180]  I don't know.
[57:20.340 --> 57:22.320]  You got plex, you got handbrake.
[57:22.360 --> 57:23.040]  This is fascinating.
[57:23.460 --> 57:24.420]  This is great.
[57:24.840 --> 57:25.740]  What do I do as a handbrake?
[57:25.740 --> 57:28.240]  What's the sunset in between the two question marks?
[57:28.380 --> 57:28.660]  What is that?
[57:28.700 --> 57:31.520]  That was a game called Meditations
[57:33.040 --> 57:36.240]  where every day you get a new little game from indie developers.
[57:37.560 --> 57:39.300]  Can I want to come over and just
[57:41.240 --> 57:44.040]  just slightly boost the efficiency of your day to day?
[57:44.220 --> 57:44.980]  Oh, please.
[57:45.820 --> 57:46.640]  I'd love that.
[57:47.960 --> 57:49.060]  But here's what's going to happen.
[57:49.160 --> 57:51.260]  I'm going to come in and be like, you don't need this, this, this and this.
[57:51.340 --> 57:52.760]  And you'd be like, well, what if I need it for this?
[57:52.960 --> 57:53.960]  Oh, I don't trust this.
[57:54.160 --> 57:54.580]  Blah, blah, blah.
[57:54.640 --> 57:55.260]  You're going to come around.
[57:55.380 --> 57:58.100]  You're going to argue me back to this exact layout of your dog.
[57:58.100 --> 57:58.540]  No, I won't.
[57:59.060 --> 58:00.680]  I don't know what any of these things do.
[58:01.140 --> 58:03.320]  You get rid of 90% of them.
[58:03.420 --> 58:04.160]  Well, I just don't.
[58:04.300 --> 58:05.020]  They don't bother me.
[58:05.040 --> 58:06.860]  And I don't know that getting rid of them helps.
[58:07.460 --> 58:08.920]  Well, it doesn't help.
[58:08.920 --> 58:10.260]  Yeah, yeah, that's true.
[58:10.360 --> 58:11.860]  It might it might hurt him.
[58:11.960 --> 58:13.080]  It might hurt him.
[58:13.240 --> 58:14.880]  No, it's not that I think it hurts or helps.
[58:15.020 --> 58:15.920]  I'm indifferent to it.
[58:16.200 --> 58:21.240]  The only way I know how to open Skype is to go 16 icons over from Safari.
[58:21.900 --> 58:23.740]  I don't ever click the icons.
[58:24.020 --> 58:25.580]  I only click Google.
[58:25.660 --> 58:27.040]  Which is why you have the bar.
[58:27.120 --> 58:27.920]  Then why are they there?
[58:28.400 --> 58:30.140]  I didn't know I could get rid of the bar.
[58:31.740 --> 58:34.220]  Oh, this is this episode.
[58:34.320 --> 58:35.040]  You can rock.
[58:35.320 --> 58:36.900]  You can get rid of the bar.
[58:36.900 --> 58:39.820]  I love this episode so much.
[58:41.100 --> 58:43.080]  You don't know you can hide the bar.
[58:43.840 --> 58:47.260]  Also, look where the Apple logo is in relation to the dog.
[58:47.420 --> 58:49.860]  We're seeing like slightly more than half of it.
[58:49.920 --> 58:51.580]  There's so much that's off the screen.
[58:52.020 --> 58:52.980]  You want to see the full?
[58:53.320 --> 58:54.200]  Yeah, absolutely.
[58:54.480 --> 58:54.880]  Yeah. Yeah.
[58:54.880 --> 58:56.020]  I want to see the whole thing, dude.
[58:56.700 --> 58:57.180]  100%.
[58:57.180 --> 58:58.160]  This is mental.
[59:00.260 --> 59:02.460]  I don't know why we're surprised by it.
[59:02.520 --> 59:04.320]  It's like the shift key guy.
[59:04.520 --> 59:05.640]  Like, what did we expect?
[59:05.640 --> 59:06.780]  Like, of course.
[59:08.340 --> 59:10.960]  This is the best camera app on the store browser.
[59:12.100 --> 59:13.900]  Was that a I mean, did you or?
[59:14.380 --> 59:15.160]  No, this is.
[59:16.140 --> 59:17.620]  This is the soy.
[59:20.980 --> 59:21.160]  OK.
[59:23.440 --> 59:28.020]  Also, my screen is I need to clean my screen, but I'm also I just am not good at that.
[59:28.120 --> 59:28.520]  I don't know.
[59:28.680 --> 59:29.080]  Oh, yeah.
[59:29.620 --> 59:31.940]  I don't know how that because you always get the smears.
[59:32.420 --> 59:34.400]  I use the towel, but I still get the smears.
[59:35.040 --> 59:36.960]  OK. Oh, my God.
[59:38.060 --> 59:39.320]  Oh, what the?
[59:40.140 --> 59:42.160]  Oh, it just keeps going on the right.
[59:42.380 --> 59:43.020]  Oh, my God.
[59:43.100 --> 59:44.680]  What are those next to steam?
[59:44.780 --> 59:46.540]  What is what are like the next?
[59:47.460 --> 59:49.100]  Andrew and I have the exact same Mac.
[59:49.160 --> 59:51.040]  I think it's a quick time.
[59:52.360 --> 59:55.200]  I have a minus from 2009.
[59:55.840 --> 59:57.800]  Oh, my from 2019.
[59:58.700 --> 01:00:01.920]  Why are you doing a lot of stuff in garage band?
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.500]  Oh, I've never.
[01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.400]  I never open it.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.480]  I think I deleted all the instruments.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.340]  This is this.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:11.040]  It's the fucking crazy garage.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.960]  You've just got this right.
[01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.180]  And you have the on screen keyboard up.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.000]  Yeah, because I the brightness on my keyboard doesn't work.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.000]  So I use that for the adjust the brightness.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.820]  This is the way.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.800]  You have this is the best episode of.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.560]  Oh, you have a whole second keyboard open to adjust the brightness.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.640]  Yeah, because I have a Windows keyboard, an Alienware that I've plugged in,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.060]  an old Alienware keyboard.
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:47.440]  And for some reason, the brightness doesn't work on the Alienware one.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.860]  When I hit it, it doesn't do anything.
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.960]  Why don't you just map that to a different key?
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.060]  Like the open and close brackets?
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.080]  He doesn't know that you can do that.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.720]  What you just told him, he doesn't know you can do.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.120]  I'm impressed that you're finding ways around it, but it's.
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:02.420]  See, that's the thing.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.400]  I will find a solution to my problem and it might not be the most efficient,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.520]  but if it works, I'm happy.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.880]  And then it's covering up what happens when you're watching the movie.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.320]  Is that just a keyboard on top of it?
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.540]  No, this is what I'll do.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.180]  OK, I'll show you exactly what I do.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:19.920]  I need to come over ASAP.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:24.760]  This is I love this. I'm so happy.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.860]  I have like the biggest smile on my face for like the last five minutes.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.140]  I'm having so much fun.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:29.800]  It's a really easy fix.
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:32.480]  This is super simple.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.740]  So if I want to watch something and I'm bothered by the fact
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.780]  that I have a keyboard, a thing that's.
[01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:43.960]  What I do is I just I just click and drag.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.160]  I just shrink and drag.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.580]  Just shrink and drag that thing and bring it to the top, right?
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.880]  If you slide it out of the way.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.020]  So where does it go there?
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:03.100]  Does it does it go into the the bar as an icon or it just stays there?
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.580]  It just stays on top of everything.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.420]  You have Catalina?
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.520]  You can't go above that.
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:10.640]  That's as high as I can go.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.820]  Yeah, that's probably as far as you go.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.860]  Well, I mean, that's better than what I was expecting, where I thought
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.400]  there was every possibility that you just put post-it notes over it, to be honest.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.200]  No. No.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.860]  iMac, it's just late 2013.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.400]  Yeah, it's listen, I'm old.
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.840]  This is you want to know why everything shut down?
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:30.840]  I was printing the law.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:36.520]  Can can we as a company expense get this man a computer made in the last decade?
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.440]  I got a laptop. Yeah.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:42.740]  I mean, if even a fresh reinstall of that would probably do you wonders.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.300]  Probably. What do you mean a fresh reinstall?
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.560]  Just tell me, what does he mean?
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.020]  I don't know what you mean, but why would reinstalling help?
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.880]  I would just get rid of.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:57.720]  Bunch of junk and 10 years worth of shit you've downloaded around.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.680]  Yeah. You keep your files here.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:06.940]  Uh, but you might maybe not have those two apps that aren't fully there anymore.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.580]  He's not. Do you have any other questions about the apps?
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.340]  Any other questions about the apps?
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.660]  This copy of Cleo iMac X has been deactivated.
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.520]  Please contact your plan owner to get a new device spot or get up.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.160]  I don't. I am the one.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.660]  I know why that's there.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.780]  Let's look at my.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600]  We got to we got to start wrapping this up.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.420]  This is insane.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.840]  This can I can I can you guys troubleshoot a problem for me really quickly?
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.740]  Of course. Yeah, let's do it. OK.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.860]  So this is this is a problem I have.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.860]  Where I'm going to take a screenshot right now.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.500]  I so you know how you got the two faces in the bottom left
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.360]  that have one mouth.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.660]  The finder.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.100]  The two faces of the mouth thing. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.600]  This Adobe Acrobat thing.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:02.260]  So you click that and then you get taken.
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.340]  I take a photo of this.
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.360]  This. Oh, geez. What's that popping up?
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:08.880]  Keyboard.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.160]  No, it's something else popped up for a second.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:12.660]  Keyboard.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.100]  Keyboard's tucked away.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.980]  OK, so you take a photo.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.240]  I or I took a photo.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.620]  So it pops up, right?
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.680]  And you have those things on the left that say iCloud drive.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.000]  Where all of your.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.300]  That's here's the thing.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.260]  They all went away one day and I don't know where they went
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.780]  and I don't know how to get them back. Your favorites.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.000]  You have all your tags are the color coded default ones,
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.340]  but you've added one that's hashtag destiny.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.020]  And you just have one hundred screenshots.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.580]  I just figured it out.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.960]  I hid them. There's a hide.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.320]  Oh, you just clicked favorites and they all unleashed again.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.460]  Yeah, I just.
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.080]  There you go.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.080]  Troubleshooting for you, man.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.520]  So how have you been getting anywhere?
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:14.320]  OK, how do you get to, like, documents?
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.880]  This is how I get the documents.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.720]  Why do you have a document called incidents?
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.540]  It's like a spreadsheet.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.280]  What the fuck is that about?
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.140]  Yeah, I got a spreadsheet of ankle incidents.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:31.340]  Have you thought about jumping on this Apple music plan?
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.260]  That's I mean, what a steal right there.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.120]  Millions of songs all at free. Wow.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.240]  Try for free. It's incidents too.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.520]  It's the second incidents file. Yeah.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:41.640]  Yeah, I'm looking. I'm opening. It's loading.
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.040]  I don't know what that is.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:47.960]  There's a playlist for the gym, for a job, for work, for the yard.
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.060]  When do you decide between job and work?
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:53.560]  For your playlist?
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:54.860]  I don't know.
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.680]  I haven't used iTunes in probably 10 years, at least.
[01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:03.980]  I haven't used iTunes since 2014 was the last time I was an iTunes guy.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.820]  OK, I think I took. Is this the right one?
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.480]  OK, so see, everything is now popped up because it was.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:12.960]  That's where it was.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.520]  So deleted users.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.320]  How often are you going in there?
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.460]  I don't know.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.000]  I was the leading user.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.240]  That's my favorite.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.700]  Oh, that's my favorite folder gap.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:28.680]  Mike, my 90 year old granddad has an iMac from a similar time
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.240]  and it's in bad condition.
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:32.500]  It's it's less messy.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.220]  Look at the name of that PDF.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.780]  Yeah, what is going on?
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.140]  Quotes, comma, semicolon, dashed.
[01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:41.020]  What is that?
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.300]  How many podcasts has your grandfather recorded during that time?
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.760]  Andrew's putting it, putting it to work.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.340]  Oh, so when my dad.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.640]  Well, I like to send things to my desktop.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.540]  And but my desktop went away.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.560]  All the logos went away.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.140]  It was just the thing I said before.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.040]  I didn't know how to fix it.
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.180]  So my solution to my problem, please don't say this.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.660]  I mean, I made a folder on my desktop called Desktop,
[01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.580]  and I would just have everything go there.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.960]  And then I would open my desktop folder.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.900]  What do you mean?
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.100]  I have a desktop folder, see?
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.160]  Well, that's the way.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.400]  Why wasn't there stuff wasn't showing up on the desktop?
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.100]  I didn't know how to reach the desktop like things.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.040]  It's behind all your junk.
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.540]  I know, but but there was a time in which there were 50,000 things on it.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.640]  And I've really cleaned it up.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:38.420]  OK, so this we got to save this.
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.720]  So go to your desktop.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:41.420]  All right, great. Now go to desktop.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.960]  OK, so imagine, imagine you're in a cornfield, right?
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.080]  And then you add another cob of corn into the field.
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.780]  It's not you can't tell where the cob went.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:58.420]  So I needed to be able to see most recent because I just had
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.860]  20,000 things on my desktop.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.520]  So once again, you put another thing on it.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.640]  All of your all of your cleanup actions involve putting more shit into it.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.260]  Just tidy up.
[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.440]  I've got it. Also, you've got it next to episode 94 of F*** Face.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.740]  Why is that one on his own?
[01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.420]  Yeah, that was that's a .AUP.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.900]  I would have accidentally saved that.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.360]  Yeah, I don't see the project files.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.940]  Oh, man. I say you get rid of that one,
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:36.960]  but you hang on to playing with Grandpa.MOV.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:42.560]  Be sure to keep commercial takes .AUP as well.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.120]  Can't imagine those.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.500]  I'm really worried about this.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.220]  View my spreadsheet.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:48.440]  What is this incidents?
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.460]  Yeah. Why don't you list off a few of the incidents?
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.880]  It's it's loading a thing that I've never opened before.
[01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.000]  Apparently it's a virus. It's called numbers.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:01.560]  Yeah, that's a spreadsheet spreadsheet.
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.200]  Yeah, it's a it's a CSV file.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.400]  Excel for Mac.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.000]  Yeah. OK, let's see.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.360]  Numbers iCloud.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.280]  It's loading. I got the pinwheel.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.160]  Column one.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.460]  What woman piss?
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:19.380]  Date last June 19th, 2020 to 27 a.m.
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.880]  What's opening?
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.060]  What is this?
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:26.600]  What do we got still opening?
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:29.840]  Sorry once again for the very visual segment.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.640]  Yeah, it also the stuff.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.560]  Also, we can't see this part.
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.720]  Yeah, we're with you.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.840]  Oh, wait, everything's why is everything going away?
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:40.380]  Oh, oh, no.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:45.740]  It's a it's just a checkerboard or maybe it hasn't loaded in yet.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:48.760]  Checkerboard.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.780]  It's just the white and gray.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.320]  Oh, it's a spreadsheet.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.780]  Yeah. Oh, oh, this is like
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:02.120]  all of the crimes that occurred in the NIMO, I think.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.080]  What is it like a police incident report?
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.080]  Yeah, it's police incident reports and where they happened.
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:08.780]  Why?
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.480]  Mischief under 5000.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.100]  Crime type mischief.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.040]  Cripe crime type ID, too.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.380]  Do you also have a police scanner that you listen to at night?
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.360]  I used to. I don't anymore.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:25.400]  And police scanner neighborhood downtown.
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:26.000]  Man,
[01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:28.040]  PCK is heading out.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.460]  Let's not make fun of that. I still do that.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.740]  You listen to cops?
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.320]  Fuck yeah, I listen to police scanner all the time.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:35.180]  Oh, cool.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.500]  All the time, like every night.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.020]  Uh, I would say probably three times a week I listen to it.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:41.780]  Oh, wow.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.720]  I just think Andrew's going to be listening to it to
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.420]  to mask up and fight crime himself.
[01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.520]  Of course. I mean, I'm sure he has a reason for it.
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.400]  But yeah, with an ankle integrity up over 90,
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.320]  he's ready to get out there and fight crime.
[01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:59.480]  He could kick so much crime and fighting crime.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.240]  Oh, mischief under or over a thousand or five thousand.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:07.600]  Loss of enjoyment of property.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.540]  Oh, man, I was enjoying that property so fucking much.
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:17.560]  Well, you're more of a mystery to me now than you were about an hour ago.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.300]  So congratulations, Andrew.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.740]  I'm just happy I got my desktop back on the on the thing.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.280]  It used to get really annoyed where I'd have to open the desktop always.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.480]  I'd always have that folder open and I'd hide it.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.140]  And then when you click the two faces, it would pop up the first one.
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:36.020]  So that one would pop up instead of.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:39.580]  So how would you get to documents if it was hidden?
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.300]  What do you mean?
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:45.060]  Well, what doc?
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.960]  I don't think I do use documents.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.340]  OK, I don't think I have any documents that I'm looking for.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.620]  I mean, incidents, I would say, could be a document.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.900]  You know what I did was I pivoted because Grammarly has an in-app
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.260]  document like writer, and I just switched to that.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.220]  Oh, of course. Yeah. Uh-huh.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:06.540]  How do I look at it?
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.640]  So I just go to documents and I'm scrolling.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.820]  I got.
[01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.400]  Winter Movie League 2015.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.080]  I haven't been in.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.180]  I haven't been in my docs all that often.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.340]  I don't think I know you at all.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.020]  And that's amazing. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.340]  You must you you must find a problem and get around it.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:39.020]  And surely think, man, that's convoluted, like surely that's a simple way.
[01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.320]  And now once that's the disconnect that you and I have is I have a solution.
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.640]  If I have a solution that I know works, I can just live with it.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.500]  And if you want to show me a more efficient way, I'm totally open to it.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.800]  But I don't question it beyond.
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.720]  That is why that is how the caps lock key happens.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.560]  I have a way to capitalize my things.
[01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.460]  I'm good. I move on.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.640]  I never think about it again.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.920]  There's never a question of can I optimize this?
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.300]  You're like the fax machine of this podcast.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.020]  I am. Yeah.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.060]  Still going strong. Still going strong.
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.380]  No innovation needed.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:25.760]  Oh, man, speaking of no innovation needed, what another perfect podcast.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.900]  I can't believe it.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.340]  We knocked it out of the park again, just like this.
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:33.480]  Out of the park.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:38.360]  Thanks for listening to episode 17 of the regulation podcast.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.140]  If you want to, I don't know, support us in some way.
[01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.780]  Gavin, you could probably tell them how to do that.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.360]  Go for it. Well, we've got Regulatrion.com, which takes you straight to our Patreon.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.120]  However, it's better if you don't use an iOS device
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:58.440]  because we get supported slightly less if you do that.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:58.940]  Is that right, Eric?
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.580]  No, we get supported the same. No, it's the other way.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.980]  It will cost you more.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.860]  Oh, they just bought the price? In November.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.780]  Yeah. So we got this notice today, just so you guys are aware.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.560]  At the time of this recording in November,
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:18.780]  Patreon on iOS devices is having to use Apple's billing system
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.720]  and because of that, they are charging more for a subscription
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.060]  through the Patreon app.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.320]  So if you want to subscribe to our Patreon,
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:34.360]  we recommend you go in a browser to Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.760]  And you can go subscribe to us directly there instead of using that app to do it.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.800]  Just so you're not having to pay a surcharge.
[01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:42.380]  We're trying to save you the money.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.460]  That's just that's how all this stuff is shaking out right now.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.380]  Again, we found out about it a couple hours ago.
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.880]  Save yourself some money.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.420]  I remember signing up for YouTube Premium or YouTube Red.
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.320]  I think it was cool at the time.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.340]  And even like the monthly charge is more expensive
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.500]  if you just sign up one time on a phone.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:03.180]  It's insane that Apple take a bigger cut than Patreon do.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.400]  They do. It's a large cut.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.100]  You're just giving free money to Big Apple if you do it.
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:11.760]  Yeah. So instead, give that money to us or keep it in your own pocket
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.180]  by going to Patreon.com slash the regulation pod and subscribing
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:16.520]  directly to the show.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.860]  So you get stuff all the time, depending on the tier.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.100]  We're kind of evening it out so that way you can see easily.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.060]  Oh, I'm a falcon.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.320]  And then you click and you be like, oh, here's all the falcon stuff
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.240]  and everything that I get.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.500]  And we're just cleaning all that up on Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.140]  But you can go there and subscribe right now.
[01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.720]  And thank you very much for supporting us.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.220]  And if you don't want to subscribe, that's OK.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.900]  You can just listen to the podcast like a normal person.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:39.760]  There's nothing wrong with that either.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.660]  Speaking of listening to podcasts, I would be remiss if I didn't mention
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.620]  that Gavin and I recently went and recorded
[01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.540]  a very special episode of the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.380]  If you're not familiar, it is a podcast that my wife and Eric's wife run
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:58.760]  with their friend Vanessa, where they read and talk about smut.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.520]  And in one of their recent episodes, I'm not sure when it comes out
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.420]  or if it's already out at the as of this recording, it's out.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.980]  OK, there is an episode.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.680]  It's probably called Celestial Glorbosis because that is the name of the smut
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.940]  that Gavin and I wrote.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.100]  And if you want to hear them discuss it and read select excerpts from it
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:23.860]  and then Gavin and I defend it to them while they interview us
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.200]  and ask us questions about it, you can hear it over on the Clutch My Pearls podcast.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:33.240]  I imagine we'll probably find some way to to release it to you, the audience.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.220]  I know we've talked in the past about having somebody read it.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.040]  We I don't think we've settled on anything yet.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.180]  But if you are if you don't want to wait and you're itching to hear it now,
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.800]  please go listen to it over there.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:46.880]  I it made me I felt ill for about two hours after we finished recording.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:51.300]  That that's that is not an understatement.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.740]  It was the weirdest thing to be in a room with four other people that I like dearly
[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:02.140]  and have us all feel uncomfortable and unhappy being in the room for a little bit.
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.860]  It was it was really wild.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.980]  I was embarrassed laughing for so long.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.900]  I got heartburn for about four hours.
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.980]  Yeah, I got a little dizzy from because we're trying to keep our laughter
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:14.760]  to a minimum because they're recording a podcast.
[01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.280]  And I I was laughing for so long at some point.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:19.220]  I got a little I saw stars for a second. It was.
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:26.580]  But yeah, I think it's a I think it's a pretty awesome story,
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.960]  if I do say so myself.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.440]  So the link to Clutch My Pearls is in the description.
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.360]  So go check it out.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.740]  And thanks for listening to this podcast.
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.560]  We'll see you next time. Bye.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:37.780]  Bye. Eric, that sucks.
