[00:00.000 --> 00:07.160]  Okay, ready? You're welcome, Nick. Gavin, are you ready? You didn't give me time to respond.
[00:07.260 --> 00:10.800]  You said ready and then you just went into it. That's not on me. That's you.
[00:12.260 --> 00:17.360]  When I say Gavin, are you ready? I'm probably talking to Huey, yeah.
[00:18.420 --> 00:21.620]  Got it. Good time. All right, here we go.
[00:24.700 --> 00:31.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 20.
[00:31.640 --> 00:36.740]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Badour.
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.640]  Hi, boys. Hello. Hey, how's everyone doing? You know what I heard? What did you hear?
[00:43.500 --> 00:50.060]  Regulation episode 17 was like the f*** face episode 16 of Regulation.
[00:51.500 --> 00:55.980]  Really? I heard it was a classic. That's what I saw. So we need to do like 15 more 17s then?
[00:56.400 --> 01:02.060]  Yeah. Yeah, it's a shame we're three beyond it now, but... Oh, s***. What was in 17 that was so
[01:02.060 --> 01:07.780]  damn special? I think the fax machine thing a lot of people really connected with.
[01:08.040 --> 01:17.100]  I think that really worked. There you go. Man, can you guys believe it? It seems like just yesterday
[01:17.100 --> 01:23.700]  we were like itching to get episode one out. We have 20 episodes into this podcast. And I went
[01:23.700 --> 01:34.060]  back and I looked. The old podcast ran for 206 episodes, 1 to 205, 206 episodes. Yeah. So we're
[01:34.060 --> 01:40.900]  like 245 of 246 episodes in to a production. That's f***ing crazy if you add it up. That is.
[01:41.120 --> 01:46.360]  That's hard to believe. Do you think we're on episode four? It will be like, remember episode
[01:46.360 --> 01:53.260]  20. Which 20? This 20. Do you think we'll be like hard to believe? We didn't know at the time,
[01:53.300 --> 02:01.060]  but episode 20 was the new episode 17. Oh, my God. If only we didn't record 15 episodes ahead,
[02:01.060 --> 02:13.680]  so we would have known. I guess 20 or how many? 23, right? Yeah. 23. Nailed it. 17 to 40. We're
[02:13.680 --> 02:20.580]  not a math podcast. Please stop. So if you get six hot dogs. Hard to believe that after 224,
[02:20.700 --> 02:28.780]  25 episodes, this podcast still just flows like this. Jesus Christ. Andrew, last night we went to.
[02:28.980 --> 02:32.820]  Oh, we're going straight into this. Well, I wasn't going to go necessarily straight into dogs,
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.860]  but I was going to run my idea by you. Oh, I'd love to hear your idea. What's your idea?
[02:39.780 --> 02:44.300]  Well, you know how some companies they'll, you know, you get a little disperse. You might get
[02:44.300 --> 02:49.420]  a little company bonus, right? Yes. And I thought maybe the way that regulation does its bonuses
[02:50.320 --> 02:55.740]  could be more chance based. Eric and Geoff didn't. I think Geoff didn't like the idea.
[02:56.220 --> 03:01.280]  Geoff didn't like the idea. Let me say this compared to my previous working engagement
[03:01.280 --> 03:07.780]  where my bonus chance was no chance. I'm OK with this. That's see now you should shut up
[03:07.780 --> 03:13.220]  because you're not going to be. I don't think you're going to be better about this at all.
[03:13.620 --> 03:18.400]  After me and Nick asked some questions, I was more on board than what we were at initially,
[03:18.400 --> 03:21.940]  where I thought we were about to give $50,000 to a baseball player.
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.580]  But Gavin clarified. And so I want him to pitch this idea to you and see what you think.
[03:26.660 --> 03:35.040]  Like $50,000? By the way, the number $50,000 is getting thrown around like we have $50,000.
[03:35.040 --> 03:42.400]  That is such a bullshit arbitrage. You might as well replace that with three free meals at
[03:42.400 --> 03:48.680]  Whataburger. Yeah, it's like 50. Might as well be $500 million. The bonus is going to be a Bugatti
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.960]  is what it is. Well, yeah, it might as well be, but we're trying to keep it in the realm of
[03:52.960 --> 03:58.700]  that almost sounds like it could be real. $50,000. So I thought for the year,
[03:59.340 --> 04:05.420]  for the year, for the company bonus, we take out $50,000, right? Not sure where all that's coming
[04:05.420 --> 04:11.040]  from, but we'll take out 50 grand. You win a 50-50 at the baseball game and you get $50,000.
[04:11.040 --> 04:17.080]  It's so much dumber than that. And here's what we do. We pick a rare occurrence. And last night's
[04:17.080 --> 04:24.720]  rare occurrence was at the baseball game, if the ball gets hit over the net towards you and you
[04:24.720 --> 04:32.780]  catch it in a hot dog, you get the bonus. Okay. Thoughts? What happens if that nobody gets it?
[04:32.880 --> 04:38.560]  What happens to... Then the money gets returned to the account and we move on. Okay. I mean...
[04:39.080 --> 04:44.260]  The only way to get a bonus is to catch a foul ball or a home run with a hot dog.
[04:44.260 --> 04:50.160]  No, that was just one instance of it. That was the instance. So is it a yearly scenario? How
[04:50.160 --> 04:56.700]  many times can there be a rare event occurrence? Oh, shit. My headphones died. Oh, shit. Hold on.
[04:58.620 --> 05:03.760]  Gavin's trying to show another rare occurrence like it's going to net him $50,000. I can't tell
[05:03.760 --> 05:10.140]  if this is a bit where he doesn't want to answer. I can't reiterate to the audience enough. We don't
[05:10.140 --> 05:18.040]  have $50,000 to play with like this. Don't get these... Gavin's stupidity is tricking you into
[05:18.040 --> 05:24.320]  thinking that we have $50,000 to be done with. We absolutely do not. It's an insane amount of money.
[05:26.440 --> 05:31.280]  But it would just be one person's bonus for that year and that'd be it. No more bonuses.
[05:31.800 --> 05:37.200]  It could just... Okay, let's just take a step back. $50,000 as a bonus? That is a salary. That is a
[05:37.200 --> 05:46.640]  year's salary. That is insane. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you... So the idea is you have to... It's a rare
[05:46.640 --> 05:51.020]  occurrence. You didn't answer my question because your headset died. How many rare occurrences can
[05:51.020 --> 05:59.080]  occur in a year? I would say if the majority of the company is together in person, you can pick
[05:59.080 --> 06:03.520]  a rare occurrence. But it's got to be rare. We're talking less than maybe 0.1 of a percent chance
[06:03.520 --> 06:09.200]  of happening. Chances are the money goes nowhere every single time, every night of the year. Could
[06:09.200 --> 06:15.000]  I maybe argue... The money that doesn't exist continues to not exist in that way.
[06:16.220 --> 06:19.920]  Could I... Maybe if we sell more Celestial Globoses, we'll have this kind of cash.
[06:20.500 --> 06:27.060]  We've sold like 300 copies of it. That's insane. That's pretty insane. What is it? Like $2? How
[06:27.060 --> 06:32.060]  much was it? It's about 200. It was $2.99. It's about 275 copies more than I thought we'd sell.
[06:32.360 --> 06:38.620]  It is. Yeah. Congratulations. You both have sold a piece of smut. That's awesome. We're 300 copy
[06:38.620 --> 06:44.540]  selling authors. I feel like that's not a rare occurrence. I feel like that's probably the
[06:44.540 --> 06:49.240]  majority of first-time publishers. So you're saying the amount is the issue. What if we take
[06:49.240 --> 06:53.500]  a zero off? I would... Okay. I mean, there's a lot of ways you could step back on this. I would
[06:53.500 --> 06:58.280]  maybe argue that it is not a rare occurrence for that to occur during $1 hot dog night.
[06:58.620 --> 07:04.780]  The park is filled with dogs. Yeah, but the chances of a ball coming right at you and catching it in
[07:04.780 --> 07:09.140]  the dog... You have to have not eaten your dog yet. I think it's more rare if it's not $1 hot
[07:09.140 --> 07:13.640]  dog night where you may not have a dog. I think this isn't... I would say that what you're saying
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.980]  is in a rare occurrence. Well, let me ask you this. Did it happen last night? Did anyone catch
[07:17.980 --> 07:22.840]  a ball with a dog? That doesn't mean that it's... I would argue if I could come up with a rare
[07:22.840 --> 07:28.920]  scenario for your rare occurrence, it's not a... It doesn't work. It has to be the most rare.
[07:29.580 --> 07:34.700]  I don't think so. I think what you're saying is very unlikely, but I don't know if it's super rare.
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.900]  Okay. Well, I mean, we didn't do this. We didn't put this into play because we didn't all agree
[07:38.900 --> 07:44.400]  on the concept, but... Yeah, we didn't all agree on it, and I'm not sure if you can figure out who
[07:44.400 --> 07:51.760]  the person who agreed with it the least was. So are you gonna rob a bank? Like, where's the
[07:51.760 --> 07:58.400]  50,000... I was just imagining if we got successful enough to do bonuses,
[07:59.140 --> 08:04.340]  right, that could just be how it's decided. No. The amount and the method could be up for debate.
[08:04.340 --> 08:09.440]  I think this is a terrible idea on all fronts, first of all. Okay. I'd rather use that... The
[08:09.440 --> 08:14.000]  idea that anybody just gets a bonus, like, I'd rather... In a scenario in which that is an amount
[08:14.000 --> 08:18.580]  of money we have to play with, I would rather go into the content and not just somebody gets a
[08:18.580 --> 08:25.520]  random fucking bonus. That's terrible. Second of all... What if you caught the ball in the bun,
[08:25.560 --> 08:30.380]  though? I don't... That's cool! Like, why can't that just be the moment? I just wanna be like,
[08:30.380 --> 08:36.020]  because imagine how great that moment would be if you did that, and then you stood up and you
[08:36.020 --> 08:41.940]  went, oh my god, I just won $50,000. You're definitely making it on SportsCenter that day.
[08:43.480 --> 08:49.920]  We did it. We did it for a second where a guy was throwing, like, big stuffed balls around the,
[08:50.080 --> 08:53.800]  like, oh, here's, like, the fan giveaway in, like, the sixth inning, and Nick caught one
[08:53.800 --> 09:00.040]  of the big stuffed balls, and everyone started yelling, you won $50,000. It was a great moment.
[09:00.380 --> 09:04.960]  It was really good. He caught it with his hands, though. The schmuck. Can I twist Gavin's idea a
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.180]  little bit? Yeah. Because, I mean, what you're saying, I love it, uh, and that's not true,
[09:09.220 --> 09:15.720]  I'm just trying to be nice and supportive of your idea, but, uh, instead, what if it's, like,
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.440]  a negative? You catch a ball with the hot dog, you owe everybody else in the company a total of
[09:21.440 --> 09:26.300]  $50,000 distributed each way. Like a hole-in-one in golf, like, you buy everyone drinks? Yeah,
[09:26.300 --> 09:31.460]  exactly. But you owe... Well, no one would ever do it. Okay, so what if you were in the situation
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.460]  to... Okay, so say, Andrew, we went to Vancouver Island, we went crabbing, and whoever had a bird
[09:38.460 --> 09:43.920]  drop a fish in their butthole won $50,000, and it happened to you, you wouldn't be for that?
[09:44.160 --> 09:49.200]  Not in the context in which you're saying it. In the context of it somehow being money that we have
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.720]  and we're assigning a bonus of company funds, I don't like that. If, like... But does he want
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.180]  a fish in his butthole? Yes. Yes, absolutely. The whole point is it's never gonna happen.
[10:00.420 --> 10:08.400]  At Sunday. Yeah, I don't... Because if it did happen, it'd be a goddamn nightmare to un-fuck.
[10:08.880 --> 10:19.300]  If a fish landed in your anus, wouldn't you think, man, that's worth $50,000? $50,000 but
[10:19.300 --> 10:28.260]  fish goes in your anus and you're crabbing. What says you? If that scenario were set up
[10:28.260 --> 10:33.600]  and then it naturally happened, I wouldn't believe in the universe anymore. Yeah. Like,
[10:33.720 --> 10:40.500]  that would be a reality breaker for me. We're not executives in suits taking bonuses. It's not us,
[10:40.520 --> 10:46.260]  we don't do it. I was just putting out a really obscure chant. If I had $50,000...
[10:46.920 --> 10:53.340]  Some guys like I do, I did fish flew in my butthole and then it showed up randomly. Trust
[10:53.340 --> 10:57.540]  me, you don't want... It's like a Reddit, it's like a subreddit. Like, hey, how did you get your
[10:57.540 --> 11:05.200]  $50,000? That is... See, like, once again, if you put this on a government level, Gavin, we're like,
[11:05.920 --> 11:13.560]  it's just like a random pool. Like, if your state or your country put out a rare occurrence bounty
[11:13.560 --> 11:21.080]  in which they're giving money to if someone is able to do this, I'm all about it. The idea of,
[11:21.200 --> 11:27.220]  like, a government being like, okay, anyone who gets a fish in their butthole while crabbing that
[11:27.220 --> 11:33.220]  gets dropped from a bird, $50,000 this year. There wouldn't be a crab left in that country
[11:33.220 --> 11:38.220]  in two years. Yeah, everyone would be crabbing with buttholes out. Well, no one would be actually
[11:38.220 --> 11:43.820]  crabbing. They'd be dodging crabs, holding their butt cheeks open. It'd just be a fucking
[11:43.820 --> 11:48.980]  whole shoreline of dudes holding their assholes open like goats trying to catch fish. You know,
[11:49.040 --> 11:53.340]  I wouldn't bother doing it, but I would just... I would just walk the line selling sunscreen.
[11:58.230 --> 12:02.890]  I'll buy it, but you gotta apply it. I could make more than $50,000 just flogging sunscreen.
[12:03.430 --> 12:07.010]  You know the clamp in, like, casino where he clamps the guy's head?
[12:07.010 --> 12:11.990]  Could you use that to keep your cheeks open? Because otherwise I think it would be exhausting.
[12:12.470 --> 12:18.130]  It'd be a fatiguing process to have to hold the cheeks. It'd be so annoying, though, if you had
[12:18.130 --> 12:22.190]  to stop, take a piss or something, and then a fish landed right where you just were. Dude,
[12:22.270 --> 12:27.530]  you're in front of the thing. You're just pissing into the water. You're going right into the sea
[12:27.530 --> 12:33.870]  if you've got the crab. If I'm at a point in my life where I'm legitimately getting up every
[12:33.870 --> 12:38.770]  morning and clocking in a solid eight hours of holding my asshole open to catch a fish in it
[12:38.770 --> 12:42.970]  because I need the money that badly, I'll probably just piss all over myself in the moment and not
[12:42.970 --> 12:48.590]  care. Oh, yeah. Things are so much worse for me at that point. Nothing's moving me off that
[12:48.590 --> 12:56.390]  asshole line. What is the funniest type of fish to catch in your asshole? Sardine? Swordfish.
[12:56.390 --> 13:02.470]  Oh, a swordfish is really good. Just land with like a...
[13:06.970 --> 13:12.170]  Which way would the swordfish be going in? What are you talking about?
[13:13.250 --> 13:18.010]  If he's pointy and going in, then it looks like you have, you know, there's a swordfish coming
[13:18.010 --> 13:24.650]  out of me. That's funny. However, if he goes in the backside like backwards and he's pointing out,
[13:24.650 --> 13:30.130]  then you have like a weapon, like all of a sudden you've got like a tail weapon and you can sword
[13:30.130 --> 13:36.130]  fight fish people. And I think you're set. I think this might be a freaking flowerpot for an anus.
[13:36.290 --> 13:41.510]  How are you catching the back end of a fish? Wait, are you not catching a fish? Wait a second,
[13:41.830 --> 13:45.430]  Geoff, pretend you're the chief of police. Okay, I'm an officer coming into your office.
[13:47.650 --> 13:52.730]  Sir, sir. Yeah, have a seat. Yeah, you're not going to believe what happened today. You know
[13:53.290 --> 13:58.790]  they're trying to catch fish in their asshole to get the $50,000. Unfortunately, yes. Yeah,
[13:58.910 --> 14:06.410]  well, it happened. And then it was a swordfish. And the guy who won in a fit of rage started
[14:06.410 --> 14:14.190]  stabbing everybody with the swordfish in his ass. I don't know if we want to take like $70,000 and
[14:14.190 --> 14:21.910]  put a like a hit on him. Not a hit, but like, you know, like a bounty. Want it alive. Probably.
[14:21.910 --> 14:27.270]  We're the police. We probably shouldn't just put out a public hit on this guy. I don't know how
[14:27.270 --> 14:34.430]  to play off of that. Yeah, let's assassinate him. Sure. Great. Classic chief of police.
[14:34.730 --> 14:40.010]  Classic fish butt guy. Maybe we can just try to arrest him the normal way.
[14:41.570 --> 14:45.310]  I just like the idea of Eric, like he said, swordfish and ass,
[14:45.450 --> 14:49.610]  pulling her out like you're a bee and just poking all the guys on the crab thing,
[14:49.610 --> 14:51.850]  sending them into the water. That's funny.
[14:53.230 --> 14:57.530]  I got to point out, Nick said puffer fish in the chat. And I think that's pretty fucking funny too.
[14:59.870 --> 15:03.010]  Especially if it goes in unpuffed and then puffs your butt out.
[15:03.490 --> 15:08.590]  You think a puffer fish in the talons of a bird is going to remain unpuffed?
[15:10.370 --> 15:11.790]  Is that what your butthole is?
[15:13.350 --> 15:18.910]  No, it has to be dropped by a bird. Oh, right, right. Maybe he catches it asleep.
[15:19.250 --> 15:24.310]  Maybe that's why it drops it. And then once it's dropped, he feels safe. So he retracts.
[15:24.430 --> 15:27.890]  That's exactly right. He nestles into your butthole and then he gets nervous and he pops
[15:27.890 --> 15:33.710]  out. And then it's basically like sinking, hanging a picture on a wall. He puffs out
[15:33.710 --> 15:37.970]  and then he wants to be aerodynamic for the fall. So he gets small again.
[15:38.530 --> 15:43.750]  And then upon impact is like, where the fuck am I? I got to get out of here. And repuffs.
[15:44.470 --> 15:48.650]  Worst. I'm going to Google this. Worst fish to catch in your butthole.
[15:48.650 --> 15:53.510]  All right. This conversation took a massively different turn than I was expecting.
[15:54.010 --> 15:59.290]  Halibut would just be unpleasant. It's just nothing close. Nothing close.
[15:59.810 --> 16:04.890]  You know, it'd be kind of handy if it wasn't. What are the light fish? We've talked about them
[16:04.890 --> 16:09.130]  forgetting their name. Got a light on it. Like an angler fish? Yeah, an angler fish.
[16:09.250 --> 16:14.850]  Have a little nightlight coming out the back. It'd be perfect.
[16:15.710 --> 16:19.210]  What bird can go that deep? I just think it's a great idea
[16:19.210 --> 16:24.390]  because then you get $50,000 and a nightlight. So you're really winning. This is fantastic.
[16:24.570 --> 16:28.270]  I think the angler fish maybe just wanted to go on a little trip and see what was going on up there.
[16:28.890 --> 16:34.170]  Head north. See what's happening. Any results, Geoff, on your fish search?
[16:34.890 --> 16:40.630]  No. The results were largely useless. The most interesting one, I already closed it,
[16:40.730 --> 16:45.530]  was large gaping wound or hole around anus. The problem would be you'd have all the
[16:45.530 --> 16:49.190]  fakers putting like a Billy Bass in their ass, pretending that it happened.
[16:50.470 --> 16:53.270]  Does an octopus count or no? No.
[16:53.830 --> 17:00.130]  Okay. I'm only saying no because I want that guy to get rejected and have to be like,
[17:00.130 --> 17:05.370]  but it did. The bird dropped it. That's next time.
[17:05.790 --> 17:10.170]  I think an octopus can get through a gap the size of its beak, right?
[17:10.690 --> 17:13.830]  Oh yeah, they can get small. So an octopus, if it wanted to,
[17:14.030 --> 17:18.510]  could take refuge in someone's ass. That is so terrifying to me.
[17:19.030 --> 17:25.390]  I've never thought about that. Has an octopus ever gone in a butt?
[17:27.210 --> 17:31.470]  Uh, I mean, definitely. Has to have. What do you mean, definitely?
[17:31.890 --> 17:35.230]  According to Reddit Shower Thoughts, an adult octopus can crawl in your mouth,
[17:35.330 --> 17:38.350]  go through your entire body and go out your butt with very little effort.
[17:38.530 --> 17:41.470]  It's like the movie Life. That's what happens to Ryan Reynolds in Life.
[17:41.830 --> 17:44.750]  The beginning. In his mouth, out the ass.
[17:44.950 --> 17:48.870]  Was that, that was a movie about an octopus? Oh, the alien is kind of like an octopus in
[17:48.870 --> 17:53.290]  the beginning of the movie. It's got tentacles, slips around,
[17:53.290 --> 17:57.130]  goes inside Ryan Reynolds' mouth and goes through.
[17:57.170 --> 17:59.430]  And then goes all the way out his butt with little effort.
[17:59.910 --> 18:01.870]  Uh, yeah. Essentially.
[18:03.610 --> 18:07.510]  It's the effort that counts, though. So Gavin, what do you think about your bonus idea?
[18:09.270 --> 18:15.630]  Um, yeah, I guess give it a miss. So I'm not trying to catch a fish in my butt?
[18:17.410 --> 18:20.170]  No. But I've already greased up my cheeks.
[18:21.490 --> 18:24.370]  I got my ass in a vice here, just holding it open.
[18:25.970 --> 18:27.930]  I mean, the whole point of each thing would be
[18:28.770 --> 18:31.090]  you want to put the money on the line knowing it would never happen.
[18:31.630 --> 18:35.850]  But it might. Here's the deal. I appreciate the creativity.
[18:36.070 --> 18:39.270]  I appreciate you taking a swing. I don't want to discourage you from it.
[18:39.370 --> 18:43.710]  I think maybe you just need to go back in the lab and take another swing at it.
[18:44.210 --> 18:45.610]  There's nothing wrong with that. Yeah.
[18:46.790 --> 18:50.110]  Listen, that's, you know, we got swordfish coming out of people's asses.
[18:50.110 --> 18:52.370]  You did some good stuff here.
[18:54.250 --> 18:59.670]  You may not realize this, but this podcast, Regulation Pod, is a comedy podcast.
[19:00.110 --> 19:03.470]  Who could have guessed? And one of the important things about having
[19:03.470 --> 19:07.590]  a comedy podcast is laughter. And there's no better way to set up laughter
[19:07.590 --> 19:10.790]  than having someone set something up, someone follow through on the setup.
[19:11.190 --> 19:16.830]  It's a core principle in comedy. And having somebody work together with you is so important,
[19:16.830 --> 19:20.790]  which is why I love Shopify, because when it comes to your business,
[19:20.970 --> 19:27.250]  there is no better partner for growing it. Shopify is the global commerce platform that
[19:27.250 --> 19:31.330]  helps you sell at every stage of your business. Doesn't matter what stage you're at.
[19:31.410 --> 19:35.190]  You could just be starting. You could be on the run with it.
[19:35.530 --> 19:37.930]  Established. They are there to help.
[19:38.330 --> 19:40.610]  Think about that. A service that could just come in
[19:40.610 --> 19:43.390]  and help you no matter what stage you're at. Unbelievable.
[19:43.390 --> 19:49.030]  And it doesn't matter whether you're selling something like GrownTubes or Gerplers.
[19:49.490 --> 19:54.770]  They are there to help you grow. And it's their all-in-one ecommerce platform
[19:54.770 --> 19:58.510]  to their in-person POS system. Wherever and whatever you're selling,
[19:58.810 --> 20:01.370]  they got you covered. Which is fantastic.
[20:01.890 --> 20:04.190]  Everybody wants coverage. Can't get better than coverage.
[20:04.570 --> 20:10.030]  Plus, Shopify can help you turn browsers into buyers with the internet's best converting
[20:10.030 --> 20:15.510]  checkout up to 36% better compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[20:16.010 --> 20:18.890]  That is significant. 36%. Great number.
[20:19.490 --> 20:21.650]  Fantastic. Impressive. Statistic.
[20:22.110 --> 20:24.870]  And you can sell more with less thanks to Shopify magic.
[20:25.150 --> 20:28.230]  Your AI-powered all-star. Everybody needs an all-star in the lineup.
[20:28.750 --> 20:31.210]  You gotta have one. And Shopify can bring you one.
[20:31.630 --> 20:34.430]  Shopify powers 10% of all ecommerce in the U.S.
[20:34.750 --> 20:37.350]  And Shopify is the global force behind Allbirds,
[20:37.350 --> 20:41.590]  Rothies, and Brooklyn, and millions of other entrepreneurs of every size
[20:41.590 --> 20:47.110]  across 175 countries. That is a crazy amount of countries.
[20:47.870 --> 20:49.970]  And plus, it's just... I mean, look at those brands.
[20:50.470 --> 20:54.270]  Established, huge brands. And with Shopify's extensive
[20:54.270 --> 20:58.670]  help resources, they're there to help support your success every step of the way.
[20:58.710 --> 21:01.030]  As I said, regardless of where you're at, they got you.
[21:01.230 --> 21:04.090]  Because businesses that grow, grow with Shopify.
[21:04.630 --> 21:08.750]  That is an incredible thing. And so I'm here to tell you about our offer,
[21:08.870 --> 21:15.330]  in which you can now sign up for a $1 per month trial at shopify.com slash face.
[21:15.530 --> 21:20.290]  All lowercase. Go to shopify.com slash face now to change...
[21:20.290 --> 21:24.070]  Well, not face now. Shopify.com slash face now
[21:24.070 --> 21:26.870]  to grow your business no matter what stage you're in.
[21:27.090 --> 21:30.990]  Shopify.com slash face. And that's what I love about Shopify.
[21:31.230 --> 21:33.350]  No matter where you want to go, they're there for you.
[21:33.350 --> 21:36.430]  So Shopify.com slash face.
[21:37.710 --> 21:39.450]  Oh, Andrew. Yes.
[21:39.850 --> 21:44.150]  I feel like I've got a note that we're going to need your mom for.
[21:44.430 --> 21:47.470]  Okay. Because she seemed to have pretty
[21:47.990 --> 21:51.190]  strong opinions on nipples in the past.
[21:53.190 --> 21:57.210]  She listens to the show, so she is listening to whatever your question is right now.
[21:57.270 --> 21:59.890]  And I can... Oh, what's the question?
[22:00.490 --> 22:03.610]  Um, so she had a... Emma Stone's nipples are weird, right?
[22:03.750 --> 22:07.230]  Yes. Oh, shit. Oh, no. Okay.
[22:07.850 --> 22:08.070]  What?
[22:08.350 --> 22:12.990]  She wasn't listening to the show at that point, and she told me to not tell anybody.
[22:15.230 --> 22:16.870]  So I've dubbed you in there.
[22:17.050 --> 22:19.230]  Yeah, I'm going to have to have a conversation about that.
[22:20.470 --> 22:22.030]  Okay. I'll do that. That's fine.
[22:22.510 --> 22:23.150]  Anyway, continue.
[22:23.630 --> 22:28.790]  Maybe you should just cough really loud at this part in the podcast when she's listening to it.
[22:28.790 --> 22:31.470]  I was just wondering her thoughts on Eddie Murphy's nipples.
[22:33.810 --> 22:37.610]  Because they shocked me in their size. Absolutely minuscule.
[22:38.990 --> 22:43.950]  They look like somebody who's getting ready to play Connect the Dots, and they just started.
[22:45.470 --> 22:47.750]  I don't think I've ever seen a smaller nipple on a man.
[22:47.850 --> 22:52.790]  That is a really small nipple. What movie is that? The Golden Child? What is that?
[22:53.110 --> 22:53.830]  Coming to America.
[22:54.110 --> 22:55.890]  Okay. Interesting.
[22:56.870 --> 22:58.470]  You've been on a really Eddie Murphy kick.
[22:59.190 --> 22:59.510]  Recently.
[23:00.990 --> 23:01.870]  What was the other one I did?
[23:01.990 --> 23:02.510]  Oh, Beverly Hills.
[23:02.690 --> 23:04.310]  Yeah, we did all the Beverly Hills cop stuff.
[23:04.850 --> 23:06.590]  Still waiting on rankings from TPG.
[23:06.650 --> 23:09.990]  He wanted to go back and rewatch the first after watching two and three.
[23:10.450 --> 23:13.390]  I gotta say, by the way, I finally sat down and finished watching four.
[23:14.050 --> 23:15.330]  Pretty good. I enjoyed it.
[23:15.810 --> 23:16.650]  It was way better than three.
[23:17.070 --> 23:19.790]  Yeah, way better than three. I'm happy they made it. I'll say that.
[23:20.010 --> 23:21.450]  Me too. I like that everyone came back.
[23:21.570 --> 23:22.070]  I wish I liked it.
[23:22.190 --> 23:25.310]  I enjoyed that too. I wish Taggart didn't look as...
[23:25.310 --> 23:27.230]  I mean, he's like 78 years old. What are you going to do?
[23:27.230 --> 23:28.710]  Man, it's a shame.
[23:29.170 --> 23:32.010]  But I feel like a lot of people, when they return to a character,
[23:32.110 --> 23:33.410]  they kind of forget how to play him.
[23:33.710 --> 23:36.530]  I feel like he'd absolutely doubt it. The exact same guy.
[23:36.890 --> 23:38.630]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. He definitely...
[23:38.630 --> 23:40.970]  Everybody who was in it did a fantastic job.
[23:41.050 --> 23:45.290]  The only thing that kind of bummed me out is that Judge Reinhold was barely in it.
[23:45.390 --> 23:47.310]  I wish he'd been in it more, you know?
[23:47.950 --> 23:50.130]  Other than that, I had really no criticisms of it.
[23:50.250 --> 23:51.990]  Have you guys seen Bad Boys 4?
[23:52.790 --> 23:55.810]  No, not yet. I need to because I was talking shit about it the other day
[23:55.810 --> 23:56.650]  and I haven't even seen it.
[23:56.650 --> 23:57.370]  No, you shouldn't.
[23:57.510 --> 23:58.010]  Oh, man.
[23:58.430 --> 24:01.550]  I didn't want to give dollars to it while it was a part of the movie.
[24:01.730 --> 24:02.510]  That's fair.
[24:04.430 --> 24:07.450]  They really amplify the Reggie character.
[24:08.050 --> 24:13.030]  And I think it might be the best acting career as far as the film arc goes.
[24:13.450 --> 24:16.590]  Because that guy's only been in Bad Boys 2, 3, and 4.
[24:17.110 --> 24:22.510]  And his character arc progression through those films is so goddamn good.
[24:23.410 --> 24:25.690]  I think I might like Bad Boys 4.
[24:25.690 --> 24:27.230]  It's not as good as 2.
[24:27.570 --> 24:31.950]  It might be my second favorite in the series only because of the Reggie character.
[24:32.270 --> 24:34.350]  You guys really need to watch it just for Reggie.
[24:34.730 --> 24:35.290]  He's phenomenal.
[24:35.910 --> 24:36.110]  Absolutely.
[24:36.650 --> 24:37.370]  We'll definitely check it out.
[24:37.730 --> 24:39.990]  His scene was like the funniest part of Bad Boys 2.
[24:40.450 --> 24:46.010]  And I would say what they do with him in 4 is so unexpected and is so great
[24:46.010 --> 24:48.390]  that he's the highlight of that film as well.
[24:49.090 --> 24:51.190]  To the point where I'm kind of tempted to be like,
[24:51.250 --> 24:55.010]  I just want a Reggie movie, but I'm worried that that would ruin the Reggie character.
[24:55.010 --> 24:56.750]  I don't know if I actually want...
[24:56.750 --> 25:00.550]  Maybe it's the perfect amount, but man, does that guy steal the show?
[25:01.530 --> 25:02.250]  He's phenomenal.
[25:04.630 --> 25:04.990]  Um...
[25:05.690 --> 25:06.410]  Other movie...
[25:06.410 --> 25:07.290]  You know what? Just a quick side.
[25:07.590 --> 25:08.550]  Geoff, watch Rebel Ridge.
[25:09.130 --> 25:10.330]  That just came out on Netflix.
[25:10.610 --> 25:12.910]  Yeah, it's from the Blue Ruin guy.
[25:13.730 --> 25:14.390]  It's phenomenal.
[25:14.790 --> 25:15.170]  Really good.
[25:15.270 --> 25:15.450]  Okay.
[25:15.890 --> 25:16.670]  I'll watch Rebel Ridge.
[25:16.770 --> 25:17.010]  Absolutely.
[25:17.670 --> 25:19.270]  I heard somebody else talking about it saying it was good.
[25:19.350 --> 25:19.850]  I can't remember where.
[25:19.970 --> 25:20.470]  That's really good.
[25:20.630 --> 25:20.810]  Yeah.
[25:21.130 --> 25:21.610]  And uh...
[25:22.730 --> 25:24.590]  Well, I guess we should go back to baseball, right?
[25:24.590 --> 25:26.170]  $1 baseball night.
[25:26.550 --> 25:29.690]  I pitched to you guys that you should all go to one of these.
[25:30.050 --> 25:31.290]  Get some dogs done.
[25:31.550 --> 25:34.010]  Do some supplemental content, potentially.
[25:34.850 --> 25:35.970]  It was last night.
[25:36.610 --> 25:42.650]  I have muted the hot dog chat, so I don't know anything about the event outside of Gavin's insane
[25:42.650 --> 25:43.070]  idea.
[25:43.990 --> 25:44.910]  How did it go?
[25:44.970 --> 25:46.130]  How would you guys say you're feeling?
[25:46.250 --> 25:48.210]  And maybe don't tell me the dog numbers yet.
[25:48.270 --> 25:48.910]  Maybe I...
[25:48.910 --> 25:49.930]  Should I guess first?
[25:50.070 --> 25:50.510]  Or how do we do this?
[25:50.510 --> 25:51.190]  Yeah, what are your predictions?
[25:51.930 --> 25:52.630]  Yeah, that's a good...
[25:52.630 --> 25:59.550]  Okay, so my question for each of you before I guess is how many dogs did you think you would
[25:59.550 --> 26:03.030]  have during $1 hot dog night at this baseball game?
[26:03.590 --> 26:06.070]  Did you have a number in mind of like, I'll probably have this many?
[26:06.670 --> 26:07.810]  I did, yes.
[26:08.250 --> 26:10.130]  How many did you have, Geoff, in your head?
[26:10.290 --> 26:11.190]  Not how many did you eat?
[26:11.250 --> 26:12.990]  How many were you thinking going in did you have?
[26:13.170 --> 26:14.450]  I thought I would eat two.
[26:14.590 --> 26:16.630]  I typically eat two when I go to a baseball game.
[26:17.350 --> 26:18.970]  I was hoping I would eat nine.
[26:19.690 --> 26:20.090]  Nine.
[26:20.330 --> 26:21.350]  Okay, that...
[26:23.770 --> 26:25.790]  Once again, it's not a race.
[26:26.150 --> 26:26.790]  Six.
[26:27.490 --> 26:28.170]  Eric was six.
[26:28.250 --> 26:28.810]  What about you, Nick?
[26:29.190 --> 26:30.890]  I was thinking four, probably.
[26:31.210 --> 26:33.270]  Okay, I think...
[26:33.930 --> 26:36.830]  I think Nick ate six would be my guess.
[26:37.530 --> 26:40.310]  I think Gavin ate two.
[26:41.310 --> 26:43.630]  I think Geoff ate three.
[26:44.850 --> 26:47.930]  And I think Eric ate four.
[26:47.930 --> 26:54.550]  I think everyone went under or right at their number outside of Nick who went over his projected
[26:54.550 --> 26:54.990]  total.
[26:55.130 --> 27:02.390]  I'm now going to open the Slack channel to start seeing some of these updates.
[27:03.050 --> 27:03.950]  I've muted it.
[27:04.050 --> 27:04.770]  Let's click it.
[27:05.130 --> 27:05.670]  Oh boy.
[27:05.950 --> 27:07.890]  Okay, I'm muting the channel.
[27:10.250 --> 27:11.690]  Eric had...
[27:11.690 --> 27:13.030]  I started with five.
[27:16.230 --> 27:19.490]  It's kind of confusing the way we've done this because it's an updating total.
[27:19.710 --> 27:21.290]  So Eric completed the first dog.
[27:21.770 --> 27:22.970]  Then Nick...
[27:23.590 --> 27:24.590]  Then Nick...
[27:24.590 --> 27:26.470]  Nick ate four dogs.
[27:29.470 --> 27:32.830]  Before anyone else updated their totals.
[27:32.990 --> 27:34.970]  Then Eric ate a second dog.
[27:35.430 --> 27:38.490]  Then Gavin ate his first dog.
[27:38.650 --> 27:39.650]  On the board, baby.
[27:40.150 --> 27:41.810]  Gavin ate his first dog.
[27:41.810 --> 27:46.310]  36 minutes after Nick and Eric ate their first dog.
[27:46.390 --> 27:50.470]  And Nick had consumed four dogs at this point, according to this list.
[27:50.950 --> 27:54.510]  Then we moved to Nick eating two more dogs.
[27:54.990 --> 27:56.070]  Putting him at six.
[27:56.830 --> 27:58.650]  Eric has another dog at three.
[27:59.230 --> 28:00.570]  Geoff gets in on the action.
[28:01.090 --> 28:02.050]  He's on the board.
[28:02.770 --> 28:05.370]  Eric eats two or one more dog.
[28:05.730 --> 28:07.410]  Or no, you're saying Gavin's still at one.
[28:09.650 --> 28:11.150]  Geoff eating dogs.
[28:11.150 --> 28:12.330]  There's a video.
[28:13.070 --> 28:14.650]  Geoff ate two more dogs.
[28:15.590 --> 28:16.970]  What a night for...
[28:16.970 --> 28:19.010]  Gavin ate one hot dog.
[28:22.930 --> 28:26.390]  I'd like to point out too, I got to the party late.
[28:26.450 --> 28:27.610]  I didn't show up to the sixth inning.
[28:27.730 --> 28:29.310]  Otherwise, I would have been in early on the dogs.
[28:29.530 --> 28:33.350]  Geoff got there late and housed them.
[28:33.670 --> 28:36.910]  I ate five dogs total.
[28:37.090 --> 28:38.910]  I started the night with five.
[28:38.910 --> 28:42.450]  I ended the night with ten on my board.
[28:42.710 --> 28:47.130]  I like that at one point, Nick was going so fast that he updated his number like twice
[28:47.130 --> 28:48.010]  in the same message.
[28:49.590 --> 28:51.350]  You nailed me and Nick though.
[28:51.450 --> 28:51.910]  You were right.
[28:52.010 --> 28:52.510]  Nick had six.
[28:52.510 --> 28:53.250]  I had three.
[28:54.230 --> 28:55.790]  Eric had one more than you thought.
[28:55.890 --> 28:57.950]  And Gavin had one less.
[29:00.530 --> 29:03.070]  It was an insanely average hot dog.
[29:03.270 --> 29:04.390]  I would have given it five out of ten.
[29:06.030 --> 29:08.450]  It was one dollar!
[29:09.410 --> 29:10.450]  You paid a dollar.
[29:10.570 --> 29:11.270]  What do you think you're getting?
[29:11.510 --> 29:15.090]  I mean, if I went a different week and it was four bucks, it wouldn't have been any better.
[29:16.090 --> 29:18.850]  Hey, Geoff, how was the first hot dog that you ate?
[29:19.270 --> 29:21.030]  Oh, the Chicago dog I paid extra for?
[29:21.130 --> 29:21.990]  Fucking awesome.
[29:22.350 --> 29:22.530]  Yeah.
[29:23.010 --> 29:23.370]  Awesome.
[29:23.830 --> 29:25.310]  Ask me how my dollar hot dogs were.
[29:25.470 --> 29:26.450]  How are the dollar hot dogs?
[29:26.990 --> 29:28.330]  It tastes about like a dollar hot dog.
[29:28.390 --> 29:29.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alright.
[29:30.910 --> 29:33.710]  Do they do different dogs for dollar hot dog night?
[29:34.250 --> 29:34.610]  Yes!
[29:35.090 --> 29:35.330]  Okay.
[29:35.890 --> 29:36.970]  You get it, you get it.
[29:36.990 --> 29:40.050]  Dollar hot dog night is the list that expired and leftovers.
[29:40.270 --> 29:40.950]  They got to get rid of it.
[29:40.950 --> 29:44.290]  They're the small, they're like the small hot dogs.
[29:44.630 --> 29:47.410]  I just thought they reduced the price of the normal hot dog.
[29:47.830 --> 29:49.110]  That'd be a fair thing to think.
[29:49.430 --> 29:50.570]  That's what I would have guessed.
[29:51.030 --> 29:54.570]  Because there's like stuff like the, like the Chicago dog and like the chili cheese dog
[29:54.570 --> 29:54.950]  and everything.
[29:55.170 --> 29:56.910]  And I think that's like a slightly bigger dog.
[29:57.070 --> 29:58.850]  But you might still want a bog standard.
[29:59.250 --> 30:01.710]  They have bog standard and they do reduce the price for those.
[30:01.810 --> 30:02.210]  But that's again...
[30:02.210 --> 30:03.790]  They just call them a dog standard.
[30:03.790 --> 30:06.310]  Yeah, they don't say bog standard.
[30:06.450 --> 30:07.390]  They say dog standard.
[30:09.110 --> 30:09.650]  The way that...
[30:09.650 --> 30:10.290]  It's a small hot dog.
[30:10.550 --> 30:11.670]  Gavin's describing it.
[30:11.750 --> 30:15.630]  I'm imagining that they have like the meat truck from Joe Exotic,
[30:15.910 --> 30:18.730]  where it revealed where all of his like pizza meats are coming from.
[30:18.830 --> 30:21.150]  But that's like the baseball hot dogs.
[30:21.570 --> 30:26.510]  It's just rotting hot expired hot dogs in the back of a truck.
[30:30.210 --> 30:32.230]  It's just hot dog central in there.
[30:32.230 --> 30:34.650]  Gavin will only eat one of those, apparently.
[30:36.070 --> 30:38.130]  Yeah, Gavin only ate one dog the whole night.
[30:38.750 --> 30:41.750]  Well, I want to know, how did you feel, Nick, after having six?
[30:41.790 --> 30:43.390]  How did you feel last night after you went home?
[30:43.930 --> 30:44.930]  I felt fine last night.
[30:45.010 --> 30:45.690]  Not so good this morning.
[30:45.790 --> 30:46.210]  Oh no.
[30:47.670 --> 30:49.450]  I had a little gurgles.
[30:49.710 --> 30:50.790]  Little gurgles?
[30:51.330 --> 30:55.470]  So should we list everybody's current hot dog total for the year?
[30:55.690 --> 30:57.810]  Remember going from August 1st to August 1st.
[30:57.870 --> 30:58.870]  I think that's a great idea.
[30:59.250 --> 30:59.390]  Yeah.
[30:59.850 --> 31:01.790]  All right, Nick, you are at how many dogs?
[31:02.230 --> 31:03.350]  I'm at 10 now.
[31:03.390 --> 31:03.870]  Eric?
[31:04.250 --> 31:05.910]  I am also at 10 dogs.
[31:06.510 --> 31:07.790]  Gavin, you're at one.
[31:07.970 --> 31:08.450]  Yeah.
[31:08.550 --> 31:10.990]  And then, Andrew, you are...
[31:10.990 --> 31:11.390]  I'm at 10.
[31:11.610 --> 31:12.170]  You're at 10.
[31:12.390 --> 31:14.030]  And then I'm at 16, I believe.
[31:14.350 --> 31:14.490]  Yeah.
[31:14.710 --> 31:15.830]  Again, not a competition.
[31:16.390 --> 31:17.210]  No, not at all.
[31:17.370 --> 31:23.010]  But I will say, Geoff, you taking the dog lead makes me feel better about having a dog because
[31:23.010 --> 31:23.630]  I got room.
[31:23.970 --> 31:24.210]  Yeah.
[31:24.290 --> 31:25.690]  I don't want to lead the dog pack.
[31:25.810 --> 31:29.670]  I appreciate you taking the front and leading the charge on the dogs.
[31:29.670 --> 31:32.370]  It is so circumstantial, too.
[31:32.470 --> 31:36.610]  I just happened to be going to hot dog heavy locations around the same time we started this.
[31:37.750 --> 31:39.370]  Yeah, it's wild how it all worked out.
[31:39.530 --> 31:42.590]  So, Andrew, you're not having any additional dogs than your normal intake.
[31:44.510 --> 31:48.750]  Uh, it's hard to say because we've been so hot dog focused recently.
[31:49.170 --> 31:51.330]  I feel like that's probably influenced.
[31:51.410 --> 31:52.770]  Like, I'm thinking of them more often.
[31:52.870 --> 31:54.970]  It's definitely influencing us.
[31:55.050 --> 31:55.250]  Yeah.
[31:55.250 --> 31:55.890]  A hundred percent.
[31:55.890 --> 31:59.090]  There's definitely hot dogs are in the air.
[31:59.530 --> 32:04.010]  And I think we all went to a baseball game for hot dogs.
[32:04.110 --> 32:04.350]  Yes.
[32:04.350 --> 32:05.730]  There's a spirit to this thing.
[32:05.790 --> 32:06.910]  Again, it's not a competition.
[32:07.590 --> 32:09.910]  It's about how many hot dogs you eat in a year.
[32:10.210 --> 32:12.890]  And this it all makes sense.
[32:12.990 --> 32:16.750]  Dollar hot dogs and eat six like that's I put down five or six when it's dollar hot dog night
[32:16.750 --> 32:21.630]  when I'm not within the counting capacity of this podcast.
[32:21.890 --> 32:23.410]  So it makes sense to me.
[32:23.950 --> 32:28.570]  Do you guys get any supplemental content out of the trip outside of just the dog eating?
[32:29.050 --> 32:33.290]  Uh, filmed, uh, filmed a couple of cell phone videos, but that's about it.
[32:34.170 --> 32:35.390]  I'm excited to see this.
[32:35.650 --> 32:35.790]  Yeah.
[32:35.850 --> 32:39.130]  Unfortunately, I showed up so late and then they were already mostly done.
[32:39.410 --> 32:42.890]  I mean, Gavin came up with that whole bonus idea, which I'm still pretty warm on.
[32:42.930 --> 32:44.850]  So maybe it's something we can revisit, you know?
[32:45.510 --> 32:45.950]  Interesting.
[32:46.770 --> 32:49.090]  Hey, uh, I don't understand.
[32:49.330 --> 32:51.010]  What if the bonus is paid in hot dogs?
[32:51.810 --> 32:53.050]  I'm not into it now.
[32:54.930 --> 32:59.850]  So even if it was the most delicious dog, Gavin, I think you'd only have what?
[33:00.090 --> 33:00.470]  Three?
[33:01.690 --> 33:03.430]  Would I have had three if it was delicious?
[33:03.710 --> 33:06.050]  Yeah, because you said you went in with wanting three, right?
[33:06.110 --> 33:06.870]  That was your plan.
[33:06.990 --> 33:07.750]  No, I wanted nine.
[33:07.970 --> 33:08.650]  Oh, nine.
[33:08.970 --> 33:09.510]  Oh, Jesus.
[33:10.030 --> 33:11.230]  And you ended up with one?
[33:12.010 --> 33:12.270]  Yep.
[33:13.030 --> 33:14.910]  Have you ever had nine hot dogs?
[33:15.750 --> 33:18.950]  No, I just wanted to get on the board and also overtake someone.
[33:20.530 --> 33:21.230]  How's that going?
[33:21.830 --> 33:23.690]  Well, got a hot dog on it.
[33:25.510 --> 33:30.730]  I mean, if you have any hope of doing that, you should probably get on it now.
[33:32.390 --> 33:38.230]  Oh, I don't think Gavin is ever going to overtake anyone.
[33:38.870 --> 33:39.510]  Well, here's the thing.
[33:39.630 --> 33:45.530]  I would say I've had more years of life where I had no hot dogs than when I had one or more.
[33:47.050 --> 33:48.390]  Somebody... I saw a comment.
[33:49.590 --> 33:52.870]  Is a buddy... what was the thing you presented before?
[33:53.310 --> 33:55.590]  The sausage on a bun?
[33:56.650 --> 33:58.310]  Buddy? A buddy?
[33:58.550 --> 33:59.810]  No, that's an A&W.
[33:59.990 --> 34:00.050]  What?
[34:01.010 --> 34:02.130]  A hot dog buddy?
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.370]  A bunty?
[34:05.330 --> 34:08.570]  Are you talking about like the bacon buddy thing or whatever?
[34:08.730 --> 34:10.650]  Yeah, whatever the fuck that was.
[34:11.530 --> 34:13.270]  Hot dogs on a bun.
[34:13.830 --> 34:15.330]  Like a buddy or a bap?
[34:16.190 --> 34:19.550]  Yeah, whatever you're saying.
[34:20.270 --> 34:21.370]  Like a sausage sandwich?
[34:21.750 --> 34:24.590]  Yeah, isn't that... I mean, that's kind of a hot dog.
[34:25.170 --> 34:28.770]  Not really. It's just like a sausage. It's not like a frankfurter.
[34:28.770 --> 34:30.370]  That's kind of a hot dog?
[34:30.690 --> 34:35.750]  I mean, it's like a... they're adjacent. They're not wildly different.
[34:36.410 --> 34:37.730]  The fuck are you talking about?
[34:38.250 --> 34:42.490]  A sausage link and a hot dog are like cousins.
[34:42.490 --> 34:47.850]  Yeah, but usually the sausage is all sliced up and it's got daddy sauce and it's in a round bun.
[34:48.630 --> 34:51.190]  Yeah, no, I mean, listen, I'm not saying they're one to one,
[34:51.330 --> 34:54.130]  but you're acting like you have no experience in the dog game.
[34:54.170 --> 34:58.430]  And I think you're underestimating your previous experience.
[34:58.690 --> 35:00.250]  I agree with Andrew. I see what he's saying.
[35:00.750 --> 35:05.030]  I have certain foods where a bad experience as a kid has kind of sullied the food.
[35:05.150 --> 35:08.290]  Like I couldn't eat carrots until I was like 20 because I choked on one.
[35:09.950 --> 35:12.070]  Was it raw? What type of carrot was it?
[35:12.070 --> 35:17.610]  It was cooked. I was just having my veg as a kid. I choked on a bunch of mushy carrot.
[35:18.230 --> 35:19.110]  Okay. I couldn't eat them again.
[35:19.690 --> 35:22.550]  So what about like shepherd's pie has carrots in it, right?
[35:22.790 --> 35:25.990]  You just couldn't have... they'd have to take the carrots out or you would remove the carrots?
[35:26.830 --> 35:27.970]  Shepherd's pie has carrots?
[35:28.190 --> 35:28.530]  Does it?
[35:28.730 --> 35:29.750]  I don't know. You might be right.
[35:30.270 --> 35:31.050]  I don't know.
[35:31.390 --> 35:31.450]  Peas?
[35:31.630 --> 35:33.210]  I would trust you if you're saying it doesn't.
[35:33.210 --> 35:37.350]  I feel like peas and carrots and celery are in every kind of that thing.
[35:38.430 --> 35:43.770]  But I had the same problem with frankfurters. I vommed on them as a kid and I never really got into them.
[35:44.090 --> 35:47.350]  You vommed on the dogs or you just vomited up dogs?
[35:47.350 --> 35:50.790]  I just had a bad vom experience where I could see the dogs come back.
[35:55.470 --> 35:57.830]  Vomiting on the hot dogs would really kill the party.
[36:00.350 --> 36:01.550]  Really ruin the time.
[36:02.410 --> 36:05.730]  That's fair though. I understand what you're saying. I've had that. I had it with chicken balls.
[36:06.250 --> 36:11.110]  Speaking of vomit and childhood, we were talking about this at coffee this morning.
[36:11.970 --> 36:17.050]  Gavin and I were, what's a food that you used to eat when you were a kid that you would never
[36:17.050 --> 36:20.030]  eat as a grown-up now? You couldn't imagine eating it again.
[36:21.090 --> 36:21.590]  Shepherd's pie.
[36:24.190 --> 36:25.510]  It's got all those carrots in it.
[36:25.590 --> 36:28.290]  Jason and Nick said beanie weenies, which I totally agree with.
[36:29.350 --> 36:33.670]  For me, it was spam. I used to eat spam all the time as a kid. I could never do it now.
[36:34.690 --> 36:37.170]  What's a beanie weenie? I've never heard of a beanie weenie.
[36:37.250 --> 36:41.010]  It's like the little tiny hot dogs in the can with the hot dog juice that you like
[36:41.010 --> 36:42.570]  pull tab the can off and you're like...
[36:42.570 --> 36:42.770]  Oh, okay.
[36:43.370 --> 36:44.090]  Vienna sausage?
[36:44.490 --> 36:45.270]  Yeah, like Vienna sausage.
[36:46.230 --> 36:49.930]  What is the thing I ate as a kid that I wouldn't eat now?
[36:50.030 --> 36:51.490]  Beanie weenie. Does that have beans in it?
[36:51.810 --> 36:52.030]  Yeah.
[36:52.390 --> 36:52.910]  Oh, okay.
[36:53.270 --> 36:57.530]  Oh, I guess I'm thinking of... well, what I meant was a Vienna sausage when I said beanie weenie,
[36:57.630 --> 37:02.490]  but I guess yeah. I would probably still eat beanie weenies if that's what it looks like.
[37:03.810 --> 37:07.010]  That's a really fun food name. Beanie weenie.
[37:07.290 --> 37:10.750]  Has anyone ever had beanie weenies and curly whirlies back to back?
[37:12.610 --> 37:15.290]  You can get squirrely for the curly whirly. I like it.
[37:15.490 --> 37:20.650]  Yeah, there you go. Vienna sausage made with chicken, beef and pork added in chicken broth.
[37:20.810 --> 37:24.810]  For me, it's probably some Chef Boyardee thing that is just like, I can't even imagine.
[37:26.030 --> 37:26.470]  Yeah.
[37:27.250 --> 37:31.150]  Dude, can I tell you how Chef Boyardee died for me?
[37:31.730 --> 37:33.850]  Dude, I thought it was just how he died.
[37:33.930 --> 37:34.830]  I thought just in general.
[37:34.910 --> 37:37.210]  Yeah, I thought Chef Boyardee had died. Oh, no.
[37:37.370 --> 37:42.950]  Well, he was a real dude that died, I think. But when I was 17, I had to have that
[37:43.430 --> 37:46.030]  reconstructive jaw surgery, the same thing that Millie had to go through, right?
[37:46.250 --> 37:46.470]  Yeah.
[37:47.670 --> 37:52.230]  And so after I had that, I couldn't have solid food for like six weeks. I could, you know,
[37:52.230 --> 37:57.670]  everything was through a blender and a straw. And so I was so fucking excited to finally eat my first
[37:57.670 --> 38:02.790]  like semi-solid meal. And they asked me what I wanted. And all I want more than anything on
[38:02.790 --> 38:10.230]  earth. I wanted Chef Boyardee cheese ravioli. I just loved those raviolis when I was a kid.
[38:10.350 --> 38:15.250]  And I was like 17. That was like comfort food. And so I went to my grandma's house with my mom
[38:15.250 --> 38:20.190]  on the day that I was finally able to eat food again. And my grandma warmed me up a
[38:20.930 --> 38:27.190]  can of Chef Boyardee ravioli. And I took like three bites of it. And then I felt something
[38:27.190 --> 38:33.890]  weird in my mouth. And I pulled out a chunk of rat fur. Oh my God. And I haven't really,
[38:34.010 --> 38:40.870]  I haven't just like grayish black matted fur. And I haven't really eaten anything Chef Boyardee
[38:40.870 --> 38:47.630]  since I was 17. That's so gross. Yeah. It was a real bummer on my first solid food.
[38:50.950 --> 38:55.230]  That's disgraceful. I've never, I've never heard you tell this story. This is,
[38:55.230 --> 39:00.870]  this is crazy. This is awful. It was pretty psychologically damaging to me at the time,
[39:00.890 --> 39:04.530]  because I had a lot invested in eating solid food again. I was pretty jazzed about it, you know,
[39:04.590 --> 39:11.470]  after going so long. And really, really, I think I cried a little bit. If I'm being honest with you.
[39:11.710 --> 39:14.410]  I assume you're just guessing rat. You didn't have it like DNA tested.
[39:14.550 --> 39:18.090]  No, I didn't have a DNA test. I just had a chunk of like matted grayish blackish,
[39:18.090 --> 39:20.770]  like clump of fur. And I'm like, what else could it be? You know?
[39:20.770 --> 39:26.850]  Would you rather it be a chunk of rat or just someone's hair who worked there?
[39:27.270 --> 39:30.370]  I'd rather it be someone's hair who worked there than a chunk of rat.
[39:33.870 --> 39:40.130]  I wonder how that even happened. I guess a rat maybe gets into like the mixing machine.
[39:40.810 --> 39:45.750]  Well, he, there's a, here's the thing. We've played the Ratatouille video game. It's like
[39:45.750 --> 39:50.650]  for a rat to go around where there's a bunch of food and we're not even very good at it.
[39:50.650 --> 39:55.430]  So I could definitely see a rat falling into the mixing machine and then getting Ratatouille
[39:55.430 --> 40:00.310]  right into some ravioli. Oh, falling in? He canaballed it, Eric. He went, yeah baby.
[40:00.670 --> 40:03.670]  Oh, absolutely. He is loving it. Ratted violi? Yeah.
[40:04.090 --> 40:07.430]  Now you know what happens to all the rats that die in the video game when you play it.
[40:07.730 --> 40:11.110]  Yep. Yeah. Like it totally makes sense. And then it's just like, oh,
[40:11.510 --> 40:15.570]  what happened to Remy? Oh, he's in Alabama inside of a Chef Boyardee canteen.
[40:16.210 --> 40:19.070]  Maybe that's like a burying ritual for rats in Pennsylvania.
[40:19.570 --> 40:24.330]  Like wherever the bottling or the packing facility is, like if you die as a rat,
[40:25.050 --> 40:28.030]  they take you out to the mixing machine, drop you in.
[40:28.650 --> 40:33.490]  I think I've seen or been a part of every piece of content this company has made,
[40:33.530 --> 40:36.770]  but I haven't seen a single second of this Ratatouille series you've done.
[40:38.230 --> 40:42.270]  You're saying it with such disdain. Why are you saying it with such disdain?
[40:42.910 --> 40:45.630]  I don't know. I just missed it. I really want to get Gavin in an
[40:45.630 --> 40:49.650]  episode of Ratatouille. We still got some work to do. It's not over. They can work you in.
[40:50.070 --> 40:53.230]  I've been through two episodes. I'm sure they got room for you. You want to watch some Tewi, baby?
[40:54.410 --> 40:58.790]  I mean, based on how Geoff felt about doing one in like his one video that week,
[40:58.970 --> 41:01.710]  I feel like he thought it wasn't great. It was a waste of time.
[41:02.270 --> 41:06.070]  I don't remember saying that at all. All right. I mean, I'll say it.
[41:07.890 --> 41:14.990]  That video was crazy. That video is nuts. Oh, man, this is a good one. Got like eight more.
[41:15.730 --> 41:20.590]  Hey, I speaking of crazy, can I tell you guys a little dental story?
[41:21.050 --> 41:25.190]  Oh, God. Yeah, I forgot quick before we went to the dentist and I don't know anything.
[41:25.510 --> 41:30.690]  You were one. We streamed what the car you'd mentioned that you'd just come from the dentist.
[41:31.470 --> 41:35.510]  So two, three weeks ago now, I went to the dentist and I had my checkup, get my teeth
[41:35.510 --> 41:39.710]  cleaned. And the dentist said, man, I hate to tell you this, but you have you have one tooth
[41:39.710 --> 41:43.830]  that's got a filling in it, you know, an old cavity from a long time ago. And around that
[41:43.830 --> 41:49.130]  filling is old metal fillings. It's like the last one I have. She was like, you see here,
[41:49.170 --> 41:52.710]  there's a little like a crack and I've been watching it for a while, hoping it wouldn't
[41:52.710 --> 41:57.910]  get any worse. But it's gotten a little bit worse. And I think we should get in there and do a crown.
[41:58.210 --> 42:03.870]  It's going to be fine. You know, it's possible that we'll pull the filling out and, you know,
[42:03.870 --> 42:07.650]  you'll need a root canal or whatever. But I think it's just going to be a crown. It should be real
[42:07.650 --> 42:13.610]  easy. No big deal. You don't have to do it. But if the tooth cracks in a certain way and splits,
[42:13.830 --> 42:17.690]  it could be really painful and dangerous. And I just had to pull some guy's tooth because of
[42:17.690 --> 42:21.730]  the way it split. And I'd rather just, you know, get it taken care of, which was, you know, the
[42:21.730 --> 42:30.110]  worst news ever for me. And after that intense bout of travel with, you know, the empty nesting
[42:30.110 --> 42:34.390]  and my grandma dying and everything, I came home. And then three days later, I had to go to the
[42:34.390 --> 42:42.930]  dentist and get that crown done. So I was pretty, pretty worn out before walking in, you know,
[42:42.930 --> 42:46.750]  I'm pretty emotionally down. I wasn't jazzed about it. I actually did something I've,
[42:46.770 --> 42:54.050]  I don't really have ever done before. I had Emily drive me to the dentist and wait and wait in the
[42:54.050 --> 42:57.730]  waiting room for me. Yeah. I don't know. I just wanted, I just was not looking forward to it.
[42:57.850 --> 42:58.310]  You're down.
[42:58.630 --> 43:04.650]  I didn't have a, I didn't have it in me if it went sideways. Right. And, uh, and so I go in
[43:04.650 --> 43:09.370]  and I sit down and they go, okay, we're just going to take care of this crown. No big deal. You'll be
[43:09.370 --> 43:12.770]  done in time. And you'll, uh, I was, the plan was I'd be done. And then immediately go on the
[43:12.770 --> 43:19.570]  stream with y'all. And so the lady comes in and she starts x-raying my mouth. And I think it's
[43:19.570 --> 43:23.890]  weird because the crown is on the left side of my mouth and she's x-raying the right side of my
[43:23.890 --> 43:29.210]  mouth. And so I stop her and I go, I just have a question. Why are you x-raying that tooth? And
[43:29.210 --> 43:32.550]  she goes, oh, we're going to put the crown on, sir. That's where you need to get your crown
[43:32.550 --> 43:37.250]  replaced. And I said, that's not the tooth that needs to be replaced. No, that, that tooth is
[43:37.250 --> 43:42.010]  fine. And she goes, no, it's on the chart right here. And I go, well, the chart is wrong. I don't
[43:42.010 --> 43:45.250]  know what to tell you. I'm sorry. You can take all the photos you want, but you're going to be
[43:45.250 --> 43:49.630]  replacing the tooth on the other side. I promise you. I was just here. And she goes, hold on, sir.
[43:49.950 --> 43:52.270]  And then she goes back and she looks at the computer for a bit and she goes, no, sir, I'm
[43:52.270 --> 43:58.510]  sorry. It is, it's tooth number 29 or whatever. And I go, okay. Um, I think I need to talk to the
[43:58.510 --> 44:03.430]  dentist. You know, I'm starting to freak out a little bit. And so another, uh, dental assistant
[44:03.430 --> 44:08.150]  comes in and she looks over the chart and she's like, no, sir. Here, I can show you right here.
[44:08.270 --> 44:13.710]  It's on the chart very clearly right here. And I go, I understand, but like it's my mouth and I was
[44:13.710 --> 44:19.610]  just here and the tooth you're talking about has a crown on it that you guys put on six months ago.
[44:19.690 --> 44:23.010]  It's great. It's a wonder. You did a great job. It's a wonderful crown. It doesn't need to be
[44:23.010 --> 44:28.150]  replaced. And, uh, I started to get a little, a little annoyed, you know, and she's like, cause
[44:28.150 --> 44:32.250]  they're arguing with me and, uh, and they go, well, we're just going to have to clear this up
[44:32.250 --> 44:36.190]  with the dentist. And then they leave and then they come back in. And so it's a little tense.
[44:36.450 --> 44:40.450]  And then finally the dentist comes in and she looks at the chart and she goes, and she looks
[44:40.450 --> 44:45.810]  at me and she goes, oh, I'm so sorry. They marked the wrong tooth down. It is the other tooth.
[44:47.090 --> 44:53.350]  The dentist was like, it was just an error at the front desk. It was, I would never have done
[44:53.350 --> 44:57.490]  the wrong tooth. I know the tooth we were, you were just here. Clearly I'm not going to operate
[44:57.490 --> 45:02.130]  on a normal tooth. I was caught, but I, she fixed it immediately. And I was like, okay,
[45:02.390 --> 45:08.630]  I'm going to stop you guys right here. You guys have like propelled my anxiety to the moon. I'm
[45:08.630 --> 45:13.990]  going to need nitrous right now. And they had to give me like a fucking, like a little tooth to
[45:13.990 --> 45:18.670]  squeeze. And I just sat there while they did my crown and squeeze that tooth over and over again.
[45:19.110 --> 45:23.870]  And it was fine. It didn't hurt. I mean, the shots hurt like always, and that wasn't fun.
[45:23.890 --> 45:26.670]  And I, now I have a temporary crown on, so I have to go back and get the permanent put on
[45:26.670 --> 45:32.530]  when we, uh, in a couple of weeks, but, uh, but God damn it. If they didn't try to
[45:32.530 --> 45:39.710]  do the wrong fucking side of my mouth. I mean, I'm so bad at speaking up about that stuff.
[45:39.910 --> 45:43.730]  I feel like, Ooh. Yeah. I think I would start and then I'd go, well,
[45:43.750 --> 45:48.350]  they clearly, they would like, they wouldn't, they would know. There's certainly no way that
[45:48.350 --> 45:54.010]  they don't. You can't, you, you can't make assumptions. No. Like, especially when you're
[45:54.010 --> 45:58.890]  feeling it with your tongue and going, what second one back? What the fuck? And you're
[45:58.890 --> 46:03.610]  feeling it going, that's the wrong side. You know, your mouth. That's crazy. That's nuts,
[46:03.850 --> 46:06.870]  Geoff. That's nuts. It's funny to me that teeth are numbered.
[46:09.050 --> 46:15.930]  Like, I've got two eyes. Which one's number one? Oh, I guess your left eye. Yeah. Left is one.
[46:16.430 --> 46:22.350]  Yeah. I would think so. What's your logic? We read left to right top down. So, so in like
[46:22.350 --> 46:26.610]  other cultures where they read right to left, but right, I'd be one. I would assume so.
[46:28.470 --> 46:33.770]  No. Yeah. It's like an American exceptionalism thing where everyone goes by our way of doing
[46:33.770 --> 46:39.030]  it. We were the first one to write it down. So sort of the way it goes. Um, Geoff, I also have
[46:39.030 --> 46:43.110]  a temporary crown right now. Oh, I was going to ask. Yeah. You went to the dentist as well, Eric.
[46:43.150 --> 46:47.450]  How did that go? I did. They, that it's fine. They knew which tooth it was immediately.
[46:47.870 --> 46:53.190]  Uh, they took x-rays to the right side. Um, no one, I, they didn't have to hand,
[46:53.330 --> 46:57.490]  they didn't have to hand me like a little tooth to squeeze or whatever. Uh, I was,
[46:57.590 --> 47:01.870]  but I immediately, the first thing I asked when they looked at it, cause it was a cracked
[47:03.070 --> 47:07.850]  molar from an old filling that I'd gotten forever ago that it just, you know, it's gone bad and
[47:07.850 --> 47:12.130]  decay and whatever. And I just immediately, he's like, all right, so it's a cracked molar.
[47:12.130 --> 47:17.670]  And I just went, let me stop you or any root canals. And he went, no, but there's a filling
[47:17.670 --> 47:21.690]  that I suggest you get in the molar next to it. So that way you avoid a root canal. And I said,
[47:21.730 --> 47:29.570]  let's fucking do it today, baby. Uh, so I got a temporary crown and a root canal. And I said,
[47:29.650 --> 47:37.330]  uh, so it was, I got, um, number two, uh, done in that. So that one's that one's fit. And then
[47:37.330 --> 47:44.090]  number one, uh, got a filling in it. And, uh, when they were getting done, they're like, okay,
[47:44.090 --> 47:48.030]  well it'll take like three weeks, four weeks or whatever to get like the actual crown in.
[47:48.530 --> 47:52.630]  Can we get you on the schedule? And I went, yeah, no problem. And they're looking at the schedule
[47:52.630 --> 47:56.030]  and they're like, oh, what about this day? And I said, I'm actually out of town. I'll be flying
[47:56.030 --> 47:59.370]  back that day. And I'd love to do it like a couple of days after I don't want to get off a plane
[47:59.370 --> 48:02.950]  and then come get my tooth messed with. And they're like, oh, you're going out of town.
[48:03.030 --> 48:06.650]  And I went, yeah. And they said, oh, then we could probably like hurry this up. Are you free?
[48:06.650 --> 48:13.250]  Like Tuesday next week? Uh, yeah, absolutely. And they said, yeah, no problem. Okay, cool. So
[48:13.250 --> 48:18.790]  if we don't get it in, we'll just call you on Monday night and let you know that we have to
[48:18.790 --> 48:22.030]  push it, but we're going to work really hard to get it for you for that Tuesday. So that way,
[48:22.030 --> 48:29.530]  when you're out of town, uh, you've got your crown on and I went fantastic. Uh, so all in all
[48:29.530 --> 48:35.830]  my dentist trip, very easy, no problems. I didn't have any issues. Everything was fine. My name is
[48:35.830 --> 48:43.190]  spelled wrong on all their paperwork, but that that's pretty common. So I'm not really, uh,
[48:43.190 --> 48:48.570]  not really worried about it. I suppose. I have a crown question. Okay. What is stopping them from
[48:48.570 --> 48:52.490]  doing the main crown day off? Like, do they need something that they don't have? Yeah. They have to,
[48:52.670 --> 48:57.310]  they have to make it out of like, I'll say porcelain, but it's something else that like,
[48:57.310 --> 49:03.550]  make it from a mold. Yes. They mold. They actually send it to a lab and they make it. Yeah. Can I
[49:03.550 --> 49:09.250]  just order all my crowns now? Well, yeah, except you're not going to know where the tooth is going
[49:09.250 --> 49:13.770]  to break and like how much, yeah. Give me 32 crowns and then here's, well, you're just talking
[49:13.770 --> 49:19.790]  about veneers. Uh, like you can get them now, but your teeth are going to shift over. Like if you go
[49:19.790 --> 49:24.050]  in four years and they're like, all right, we'll put like, we'll replace like this molar and they
[49:24.050 --> 49:27.470]  put it in and they go, Oh, you already have the crown. And they try to put it in. It's not going
[49:27.470 --> 49:31.370]  to fit your teeth. They're like constantly shifting inside your skull. They move, but they
[49:31.370 --> 49:36.210]  don't change shape. Surely. Right. They move. And you're trying to fit these things together.
[49:36.330 --> 49:40.970]  And sometimes there's overlap and you're not able to, what? I'll be honest. I don't fully
[49:40.970 --> 49:49.610]  understand what a crown is doing. Just hurting. Somebody saying they have 32 crowns could be
[49:49.610 --> 49:56.730]  such a flex or such an issue. You're either terrible, terrible in the dentistry or you're
[49:56.730 --> 50:04.710]  really good at battle royale. You only get one crown, right? Like the kingdom, like you ideally,
[50:04.730 --> 50:09.490]  you're not, you're not getting multiple. I feel like I've never seen a movie where a King has
[50:09.490 --> 50:17.550]  like two crowns. I might have different ones for different. That just seems, that seems like a
[50:17.550 --> 50:22.490]  sports illustrated cover with like LeBron James sitting on a throne and he has two crowns on.
[50:23.010 --> 50:28.070]  Yeah, it does. One on his head, one on the basketball. Yeah. Oh, that's pretty, actually
[50:28.070 --> 50:36.970]  shit. Hang on. It's pretty close. Oh yeah. Here's, here's King Charles and a bottle of
[50:36.970 --> 50:41.410]  Chambord, I guess. I'm not really sure what that is. He's got his hat and he's got the holy hand
[50:41.410 --> 50:49.270]  grenade. Is Lincoln the closest a president has gotten to having like a crown look?
[50:49.910 --> 50:54.670]  Like it's kind of disappointing. There isn't a presidential hat or piece of headwear.
[50:55.030 --> 51:00.370]  I've never thought about that. I never thought about how a president doesn't have another hat.
[51:00.550 --> 51:05.750]  Like there's, there's only one hat president. Yeah. You'd really think that would have carried
[51:05.750 --> 51:11.370]  on in some form. At least you would wish it did. I'd love to see what a presidential was still a
[51:11.370 --> 51:16.710]  top hat. Like if the tradition stayed the same, but all the culture around it shifted. So it just
[51:16.710 --> 51:22.070]  became increasingly weirder every term. That'd be cool. I'd love that. That'd be awesome.
[51:22.670 --> 51:26.390]  I started Googling it to see if I could find anything. And the only thing that I really found
[51:26.390 --> 51:31.170]  is George W. Bush in a steampunk hat. It's not really what we're looking for, but I think it
[51:31.170 --> 51:37.450]  would be pretty cool. Yeah. If they kept trying to modernize the top hat to the times, you know,
[51:37.790 --> 51:43.730]  I'm falling down a rabbit hole here. Here's Barack Obama. Here's Barack Obama in a cool,
[51:43.730 --> 51:49.510]  Kentucky Derby hat. This just looks like the filter they put on the screen at the baseball
[51:49.510 --> 51:56.810]  games. It does. And then here's Bill Clinton in a fun hat also. Now, see, that looks like it could
[51:56.810 --> 52:03.350]  be real. Yeah. This is great. Presidential hats might be a lane. I might be into this.
[52:04.450 --> 52:11.330]  I wonder if there are other leadership cultures that have crown adjacent things.
[52:11.930 --> 52:17.630]  Like, I wonder if it's just the monarchy that has the crown. Are there other like, I don't know,
[52:17.750 --> 52:22.070]  I don't even know how to describe it because the monarchy isn't really like the idea of like an
[52:22.070 --> 52:25.990]  elected official having to put on headwear as part of their job, I think is what's really funny to
[52:25.990 --> 52:33.190]  me. I imagine there's probably dictatorships where the person is wearing a crown. But like
[52:33.190 --> 52:39.410]  the idea of like a democracy and also a crown culture would be amazing. I can't think of an
[52:39.410 --> 52:45.850]  item that would be timeless. Maybe like a watch? No, that's actually, that's probably like the most
[52:45.850 --> 52:52.050]  timed thing. So I wouldn't think that that's timeless. I walked into that one. Well done.
[52:55.790 --> 53:01.750]  How many Dobermans do y'all see? I still haven't seen any. Goddamn, I'm at three since last
[53:01.750 --> 53:06.910]  recording. Zero. I'm going to reset my Doberman count to zero. It's been three. A lot of Dobermans
[53:06.910 --> 53:12.870]  out there. Do you think maybe Dobermans are a... Whoa. The fuck was that? What just happened?
[53:12.870 --> 53:16.290]  Discord just went crazy for a minute. Dude, Discord went nuts for a second. That was nuts.
[53:16.630 --> 53:25.550]  Someone tripped over a cable at Discord. Oh, now that we got Nitro, we got that speed.
[53:28.510 --> 53:32.430]  Yeah. Geoff, are you maybe worried that like the Doberman, you know how like
[53:33.670 --> 53:38.070]  crows symbolize in some, I think it's like Scottish culture, that death is coming.
[53:38.550 --> 53:43.130]  It might not be Scottish, but there are cultures in which like seeing crows is a bad sign. Do you
[53:43.130 --> 53:47.870]  think Dobermans might be that for you in dental work? Like the more Dobermans you see, the more
[53:47.870 --> 53:54.310]  likely it is you're going to have a dental issue. Uh, no, I didn't. I didn't until now. But maybe,
[53:54.450 --> 53:59.370]  yeah, like maybe before you, like you just didn't notice how many Dobermans were in your life
[53:59.370 --> 54:04.270]  and now you're tracking it. I'm going to say it's different. I'm going to say it's this. The
[54:04.270 --> 54:09.370]  Doberman is well known as a brave guardian and noble companion. I think it's the universe out
[54:09.370 --> 54:14.990]  there telling me, hey, we got your back. We're guarding you. We're companioning you. Maybe every
[54:14.990 --> 54:20.330]  time you see a Doberman, you've avoided something. That's a great, maybe, like maybe I just got
[54:20.330 --> 54:26.690]  protected. I just got dobed. I love that idea. Now, I think this is good that you guys are
[54:26.690 --> 54:32.710]  speculating. However, I've gone to the source spirit-animals.com of Doberman symbolism.
[54:33.690 --> 54:40.270]  In this case, Doberman symbolism is asking you if you are defending somebody without knowing the
[54:40.270 --> 54:47.310]  full facts. For example, perhaps the drama of the moment is just drama designed to engage your
[54:47.310 --> 54:52.210]  empathy. So, could be, you know, you don't, you need all the facts. However,
[54:53.150 --> 54:58.990]  alternatively, this, I think this might apply to you. Doberman symbolism could be reminding you
[54:58.990 --> 55:03.370]  that everything has an opposite. And some, I think sometimes you're forgetting that. I think
[55:03.370 --> 55:08.330]  sometimes you think things have sames. And this is reminding you every time you see a Doberman go,
[55:08.530 --> 55:14.790]  oops, something opposite is happening. Similar to the meaning of crow, light must have darkness
[55:14.790 --> 55:20.270]  to exist and be understood, Geoff. So. So, which one of you is it talking about?
[55:20.910 --> 55:26.650]  Well, I can only tell truths and Nick can only speak in lies. So, you're going to have to get
[55:26.650 --> 55:32.350]  through this door one way or the other. I would love to see you guys as the
[55:32.350 --> 55:42.410]  door knockers in labyrinth. What is the opposite of a hot dog? What is it?
[55:43.830 --> 55:48.370]  Hamburger. Hamburger. Okay. The hot dog's natural enemy is the hamburger.
[55:48.370 --> 55:53.750]  Okay. Just want to make sure. I had an idea for supplemental the other day. I wanted to run by
[55:53.750 --> 55:58.110]  you guys. As you may or may not know, and I guess maybe we can talk about it next episode because
[55:58.110 --> 56:04.050]  we're probably close to wrapping up. Yeah. But we're on a vinyl kick right now. I've been given
[56:04.050 --> 56:11.690]  out vinyls as rewards, as like gold stars for accomplishments within the company. And we could
[56:11.690 --> 56:18.790]  give a vinyl update because Gavin got received all his finally. And while Eric and I went to go
[56:18.790 --> 56:23.310]  vinyl shopping together, we filmed a little supplemental where we put on loves and we
[56:23.310 --> 56:27.990]  just recorded ourselves record shopping. And it was a lot of fun to do. It got me thinking,
[56:28.590 --> 56:34.450]  maybe we should do a supplemental where we all throw on those loves and we just walk around the
[56:34.450 --> 56:39.230]  mall and just call it mall walkers. And we just have a conversation as we walk around the mall
[56:39.230 --> 56:42.790]  and just like point stuff out and talk about it. I think it'll be hard to hear our audio over the
[56:42.790 --> 56:47.590]  sound of Nick's boots. Yeah, I was about to say, I really appreciate that you've crafted a piece of
[56:47.590 --> 56:53.550]  wink supplemental content that gets Nick to the mall. Thanks for pointing it out ahead of time
[56:53.550 --> 56:58.650]  that OK, you guys ruined the surprise. But yeah, anyway, I think that would be a lot of fun
[56:58.650 --> 57:03.730]  with or without the boots. Let's do it. I would do it. All right, Nick. Nick, when you're editing
[57:03.730 --> 57:10.030]  this, delete this part so you forget about it. Yeah. Erase this from your memory. OK. Oh, I've
[57:10.030 --> 57:16.210]  got a I've got a cat piss update. Oh, did you fully remove the room? Is it gone? You've been sucking
[57:16.210 --> 57:22.110]  on the rug until it's gone or what? No, I just found a bit, found a little bit more. No. No!
[57:23.550 --> 57:31.390]  It pissed in the outlet? Yep. Is it still, is the smell a huge issue for you still?
[57:31.990 --> 57:38.890]  Oh, horrible. Oh, God. So when you find it like that, do you then just scour that spot until it's
[57:38.890 --> 57:44.030]  gone and clean? And then you're like, well, I know that's not contributing to the smell anymore.
[57:44.430 --> 57:48.570]  Well, here's what I actually do. I give it a real good scrub down and then I turn the lights off
[57:48.570 --> 57:52.610]  and then I check again with the UV light and realize that I've just smeared it all around.
[57:52.830 --> 57:59.470]  And now the area is about four times as big again. It's so difficult to get rid of. Is the cat
[57:59.470 --> 58:05.750]  continuing to pee? Like, is it possible this is new pee or are you still just cleaning up messes
[58:05.750 --> 58:12.190]  from last time? I have no idea. I need like a piss scientist to tell me how to, I don't know,
[58:12.410 --> 58:17.070]  like the rings on a tree stump. You should get a piss scientist. Or you could just put a camera
[58:17.070 --> 58:24.070]  in the room. No, no. He's too smart for that. He'll unplug it somehow. Get a piss scientist.
[58:24.770 --> 58:30.730]  Hey, Andrew, are you busy soon? I didn't go to college, so I, you know,
[58:31.730 --> 58:36.030]  I don't, uh, I'm not, I don't have my degree in piss. All right, so we need to crown the
[58:36.030 --> 58:39.850]  piss scientist then if it's not you. We've got piss boy, piss rat, and piss scientist.
[58:41.890 --> 58:45.230]  If you want to be the piss scientist, let us know in the comments.
[58:45.650 --> 58:51.850]  Leave a comment that says I'm the piss scientist. We've had a lot of excitement over being in this
[58:52.410 --> 58:58.310]  park video. People are really excited to be managed by Eric through the game. And you. But,
[58:58.410 --> 59:04.090]  but yeah, yeah. Why are you leaving out the crucial and Gavin part? That was the, the kind of,
[59:04.310 --> 59:09.390]  the part that really tied the idea together. Yeah. Both of them. It's true. Hand in hand.
[59:09.750 --> 59:12.810]  Are you going to recruit your team, Gavin? How are you going to pick between the people?
[59:13.790 --> 59:21.530]  Oh, that's a great... So quiet. As soon as we said and Gavin, nothing. Do we share the pool
[59:21.530 --> 59:26.010]  and we pick one at a time? Yeah, I think, yeah, I think we have to. And I think that whoever's
[59:26.010 --> 59:31.370]  picked last should really hold it against us. So we're doing, we're doing a falcon draft.
[59:32.110 --> 59:37.430]  Yeah. Yes. And we'll have to draft the falcons. Like we're doing a, like we're doing a falcon
[59:37.430 --> 59:44.130]  draft where we're typically when we say falcon draft, it's a draft that is up for falcons to
[59:44.130 --> 59:50.490]  listen to. But in this case, this will be a draft of falcons. You just made this idea practical.
[59:50.490 --> 59:56.150]  Well, this is totally doable. It will be a falcon event. Probably not this month, maybe in October.
[59:57.070 --> 01:00:02.210]  So all the falcons could get in the discord thing and we'll pick 16 falcons. Yeah. Well,
[01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:08.550]  we'll do a stage and we could bring, we'll do one at a time and we'll time. This is great.
[01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.190]  Well, maybe, maybe if there's that many falcons ready to be picked, we introduce new team captains.
[01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:18.990]  No, because we need commentators to call the action because I'm not going to be able to see
[01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:23.390]  what you're doing. And like, you're not gonna be able to see what I'm doing and we need it,
[01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:29.630]  need these guys to talk it through. Wait, so we're managing eight people each in our ear
[01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:34.750]  and listening to commentary. No, I don't think, no, I think it's like these are individual runs.
[01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:41.970]  Oh, wow. I think it's like you on stage with the people and we can watch, but like there's
[01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:46.990]  no commentary. It's just we're timing and you're doing the runs. Wow. That's a great idea. I'll
[01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:55.250]  make a post on our Patreon where people could register to be picked by the captains. We do a
[01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:58.570]  falcon draft and then we'll make it a discord event. It's a falcon draft where we're drafting
[01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:02.230]  the falcons, not the falcons you think, but you, indeed, the falcons. The people
[01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:08.930]  at our falcon tier that want to participate in this. And I will gladly throw my hat into
[01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:14.490]  the captainship. I don't mind. Wow. I'd love to do that. Wow. Wow. Excited. You can sign up to be
[01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:20.530]  a falcon at Regulatreon.com if you would like. It's a, I mean, it's not a priciest tier, but it's
[01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:26.270]  up there. It is. It's up there. But hey, do you want to get yelled at? You can be picked last by
[01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:31.230]  Gavin and have to live with that for the rest of your fucking life. And remember, be mad at him.
[01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:35.830]  He did this to you. He could have picked you sooner and he didn't. He could have picked you first and
[01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:40.190]  he chose not to. Could have picked you first. He picked that other guy. Oh, I don't know what would
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:46.510]  be worse. Signing up and not getting picked at all, or signing up to just get yelled at by Eric
[01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.930]  for like 30 minutes. Yeah, I mean, it's got to be, look, there's not a, this is a no win situation
[01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:55.750]  for you, the person paying for this. And also, what are we, how are we picking? Are we just
[01:01:55.750 --> 01:02:01.210]  looking at names? I think, yeah, I just compiled the names and then, and then do some form of
[01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:07.030]  draft. Yeah. Everyone's going to be changing their names to the funniest thing. We're going to have a
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:14.370]  ton of Spummer. I'm going to take Spummer 3. All right, I'm going to take Spummer 9. All right,
[01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:22.170]  give me Spummer 31. Meanwhile, Spummer 47 doesn't get picked. He's like, what the fuck? I'm Spummer!
[01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:29.470]  Spummer 47! Then you got the real Spummer, Spummer OG. Yeah. Will the real Spummer please stand up?
[01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:33.530]  There's 12 Spummer 69s and we're not picking any of them.
[01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:39.430]  Shall we wrap this up and go to our next? Yeah, yeah, let's wrap it up because I like this idea
[01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:43.490]  now that Gavin is locked in on it also. When it was just me, not for it. When it's me and Gavin,
[01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:50.290]  I know how much Gavin doesn't want to do this, so I'm for it. Very exciting to me. I wanted to watch.
[01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:54.410]  Right, and you get to watch my run and then we get to watch your run.
[01:02:54.790 --> 01:03:00.690]  Yeah. Yeah, but we can't watch each other's runs. Sure you can. Why not? Nick said you can.
[01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.410]  Well, because it will give us techniques.
[01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:10.010]  We can figure this out. We'll figure this out. There's a random order. I'm not worried about it.
[01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:15.390]  I'm going to win no matter what. I've seen the way you communicate with Geoff where you don't
[01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:22.470]  call out ducks or he does call out ducks and then you go, what are we doing? I'm excited. You guys
[01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:27.190]  got to really pay attention when we play Pika Park 2 tomorrow. The duck call outs could have been
[01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:31.770]  better for sure. That's definitely something to work on. I don't know what's going on. This has
[01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:36.710]  been a real dumb month for me, September. I'm in my dumb era. You know, at least you got it on
[01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:40.430]  Steam, man. Thanks for doing that. Guys, thanks so much for listening to this episode of the
[01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:45.370]  podcast. The 20th episode. Is this the new 17? Yeah, I think the cat piss is probably drowning
[01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:52.170]  out your brain. Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod. You can also view our gaming
[01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:58.950]  videos on our gaming podcast channel, Regulation Gameplay. We have a lot of stuff coming out all
[01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:04.050]  the time. We're very excited with what we're doing right now. We hope you are too. And we'll see you
[01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:11.190]  next time for the regulation crew. That's Geoff, Gavin, Andrew, Nick and Eric. Bye! And if you're a piss
[01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:22.130]  scientist, please let me know what happens when you mix carbon dioxide with ammonia. That's what
[01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:29.190]  it's for. All right, let's tail sync. Hit stop, but that's fine. Hit rerecord. Andrew,
[01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:34.330]  did you just say you were going to hit record again? Yeah, he did. Yeah, he fucked it all up.
[01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:40.650]  Yeah, it's all fucked up. Do you have any idea why we sync? He has no idea. It's simply a thing
[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:47.530]  that he knows that happens. There's no understanding of what it is. Wow, Nick can sync up this 11 second
[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:53.230]  chunk at the end. There's only a sync. Do you want me to put in the notes not to use his tail
[01:04:53.230 --> 01:05:00.210]  sync, Nick? Are you shitting me? Why are we syncing? I didn't know Andrew had cat piss in
[01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:06.530]  his house too. Why are you breathing over there? I can't hear you, sorry. I'm listening to my
[01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:16.630]  Discord on Steam or whatever. My bits are popping up. I don't know how any of this syncs. Hit stop,
[01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:20.190]  hit start again. Why not? It's the same track. Why don't you know why we're doing anything?
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:32.880]  What? Oh, it's so cool. Isn't it better if he doesn't though? What? See? He keeps saying
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.220]  what? He just keeps saying what? Can all this be left in?
