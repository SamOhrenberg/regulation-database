[00:00.000 --> 00:03.420]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.480 --> 00:05.800]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton.
[00:05.880 --> 00:10.120]  Gavin Freene. I'm a new man. Eric Baudour.
[00:10.480 --> 00:13.240]  This is episode twenty two.
[00:13.880 --> 00:18.360]  So you say it like I got to go cut the grass, then go to Costco.
[00:18.880 --> 00:20.940]  Got to go buy. Got to get my oil change.
[00:21.460 --> 00:22.480]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:22.760 --> 00:24.260]  Geoff, I'm a new man.
[00:24.620 --> 00:26.820]  I had a big life event since we last met.
[00:26.820 --> 00:30.040]  OK, I've been hearing about it for a long time.
[00:30.180 --> 00:31.760]  I finally took that Pepsi challenge.
[00:32.160 --> 00:33.860]  I'm a Pepsi guy. Big life event.
[00:34.560 --> 00:35.140]  Are you serious?
[00:35.660 --> 00:36.560]  No, I'm just kidding.
[00:36.700 --> 00:40.740]  I was making a joke because that would be such an insignificant life event.
[00:41.020 --> 00:41.660]  Pepsi is fine.
[00:41.900 --> 00:43.140]  I think Pepsi is better than a two liter.
[00:43.260 --> 00:44.100]  That's a big deal, dude.
[00:44.460 --> 00:46.860]  Yeah, you know, if I look down the roster,
[00:46.860 --> 00:49.180]  I probably am more of a Pepsi guy than a Coke guy.
[00:49.500 --> 00:51.400]  But head to head, I probably would lean Coke.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.640]  I'm right there with you.
[00:52.900 --> 00:53.320]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:54.180 --> 00:56.980]  What you just said there made absolutely no sense.
[00:57.180 --> 00:58.100]  No. What do you mean?
[00:58.260 --> 00:58.800]  Repeat it.
[00:58.840 --> 01:00.340]  Repeat it back to me and then I'll explain.
[01:01.140 --> 01:02.100]  Pretend that you're me.
[01:02.220 --> 01:03.120]  You say what I said.
[01:03.340 --> 01:03.720]  I'll...
[01:03.720 --> 01:07.700]  You said something like, like down the line, I prefer this thing.
[01:07.740 --> 01:09.180]  But head to head, I prefer the other thing.
[01:09.320 --> 01:09.440]  Yeah.
[01:10.360 --> 01:12.820]  So Pepsi and Coke are both brands, Gavin.
[01:12.920 --> 01:14.360]  They make a variety of beverages.
[01:14.780 --> 01:18.700]  I'm saying if I look down their roster, you know, like Marvel vs.
[01:18.820 --> 01:21.560]  DC, probably lean more Pepsi.
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.700]  But head to head as beverages, I would be more of a Coke fan.
[01:26.860 --> 01:31.280]  So you're saying you're more of a Pepsi Co fan, but head to head,
[01:31.340 --> 01:32.500]  you prefer Coke over Pepsi.
[01:32.820 --> 01:33.800]  I, yes, I would.
[01:34.080 --> 01:35.720]  Mountain Dew way better than Maliello.
[01:35.820 --> 01:37.060]  Crush is better than Fanta.
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.020]  I've never had Starry.
[01:39.220 --> 01:40.000]  Barks is better.
[01:40.300 --> 01:41.480]  Starry's so good, dude.
[01:41.640 --> 01:43.580]  But what happens when you throw in...
[01:43.580 --> 01:44.260]  Sorry, that's my jam.
[01:44.260 --> 01:46.780]  ...curing Dr. Pepper to the mix, Andrew?
[01:47.280 --> 01:48.060]  Oh, let's see.
[01:48.060 --> 01:49.240]  See, I view Dr.
[01:49.400 --> 01:54.440]  Pepper is like it is the third party candidate of the soda world.
[01:55.260 --> 01:57.440]  The Jill Stein of soda.
[01:57.480 --> 01:59.060]  Yes, it is.
[01:59.980 --> 02:01.540]  Keurig, Arsicola, fuck.
[02:01.880 --> 02:05.520]  Well, wait, Crush is, but Crush is Pepsi, isn't it?
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.100]  According to the other thing, does Pepsi own part of this?
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.300]  Because on the other graphic, Pepsi has Crush.
[02:12.900 --> 02:15.720]  I think they bounced, like different brands have bounced around
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.200]  from time to time, maybe.
[02:17.200 --> 02:19.440]  Because I don't know, like...
[02:19.440 --> 02:20.960]  Well, Barks is the best root beer.
[02:21.320 --> 02:22.700]  Kind of like how Chuck E.
[02:23.060 --> 02:26.060]  Cheese owned Showbiz for a while, and now they own Chuck E.
[02:26.100 --> 02:26.920]  Cheese eventually.
[02:27.380 --> 02:27.600]  Yeah.
[02:28.020 --> 02:32.320]  I don't like it when when the main one doesn't have its own thing, though.
[02:32.460 --> 02:35.980]  Like, you know how Mars owns all the chocolate?
[02:36.320 --> 02:37.020]  Yeah, sure.
[02:37.340 --> 02:37.880]  Galaxy and all that stuff.
[02:37.920 --> 02:42.360]  But they also have a Mars bar, like the the flagship thing.
[02:42.620 --> 02:45.900]  But there's no like there's no Pepsico juice.
[02:46.500 --> 02:47.100]  It's Pepsi.
[02:47.300 --> 02:47.920]  What do you mean, Pepsi?
[02:48.060 --> 02:49.280]  The fuck are you talking about?
[02:49.400 --> 02:51.640]  Are you? Oh, are you upset that it's not called PepsiCo?
[02:52.000 --> 02:52.760]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53.100 --> 02:58.160]  But but that is now I will say that is that's what Eric, the actor, called it
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.880]  when he when he made his demand, when he made his demand
[03:02.880 --> 03:07.560]  for all those two liters of PepsiCo in New Mexico.
[03:07.940 --> 03:11.020]  But as long as there were no werewolves.
[03:11.360 --> 03:15.060]  Hey, shout out to shout out to werewolf fearing Eric, the actor.
[03:15.900 --> 03:17.020]  May he rest in peace.
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.140]  Looking at this graphic as you know, if you want to attack me, Gavin,
[03:20.340 --> 03:24.140]  as a ridiculous point, I think Dr. Pepper should be at the top.
[03:24.700 --> 03:27.020]  That's what bothers me about this graphic because it's.
[03:27.120 --> 03:27.880]  Why wouldn't Dr.
[03:27.940 --> 03:28.560]  Pepper be at the top?
[03:28.680 --> 03:31.960]  Because it's cola across the top and it's not a cola.
[03:32.080 --> 03:35.100]  But I feel like it's like, hey, this is this brand's heavy hitter.
[03:35.280 --> 03:35.940]  Keurig Dr.
[03:36.060 --> 03:38.420]  Pepper's heavy hitter should not be at the bottom of this.
[03:38.620 --> 03:39.800]  I saw a TikTok the other day.
[03:39.880 --> 03:41.000]  I don't know if I sent it to you guys.
[03:41.040 --> 03:44.440]  That said it was like one of those realization TikToks.
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.160]  And the guy said, I just realized that Dr.
[03:47.260 --> 03:49.160]  Pepper is just barbecue Sprite.
[03:49.320 --> 03:53.200]  And I have been laughing about that in my head for like a fucking week.
[03:53.380 --> 03:55.040]  Whoa, that's crazy.
[03:55.340 --> 03:56.440]  Barbecue Sprite.
[03:57.120 --> 03:59.420]  It's the funniest fucking thing I've ever heard.
[04:01.140 --> 04:04.480]  I can't explain like I don't know that I can verbalize why.
[04:04.600 --> 04:05.620]  But it makes sense, right?
[04:05.660 --> 04:06.280]  But it's right.
[04:06.360 --> 04:09.200]  But you said it and I went, that's exactly what it is, though.
[04:09.340 --> 04:10.160]  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
[04:10.660 --> 04:13.560]  It's so weird because it just it hit so hard when he said it.
[04:14.580 --> 04:16.300]  You a baked beans guy, Gavin?
[04:16.960 --> 04:17.560]  Love him.
[04:17.700 --> 04:17.940]  Well,
[04:20.000 --> 04:20.820]  Heinz baked beans.
[04:21.180 --> 04:21.580]  Absolutely.
[04:22.260 --> 04:23.400]  Like breakfast beans.
[04:23.800 --> 04:27.260]  Actually, I bought you a can of baked beans to expand the palette a little bit.
[04:27.300 --> 04:28.020]  Just the other day.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.740]  I have to send you. You bought me beans?
[04:29.980 --> 04:33.700]  Yeah, I was buying other stuff and I was on a site and I was looking at what else they had.
[04:34.040 --> 04:35.760]  They had cans of Dr.
[04:35.920 --> 04:37.740]  Pepper infused baked beans.
[04:38.400 --> 04:40.020]  Got us some of those, man.
[04:40.360 --> 04:41.320]  Gonna be a great time.
[04:41.780 --> 04:42.320]  I'll try them.
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.920]  I'm not, you know, as you know,
[04:43.920 --> 04:46.460]  I'm not a soda guy, but I don't mind Dr.
[04:46.540 --> 04:48.660]  Pepper. I can weigh in on the Dr.
[04:48.800 --> 04:49.680]  Pepper baked beans.
[04:49.960 --> 04:50.340]  You had them?
[04:50.600 --> 04:54.540]  Emily insisted we buy them about three weeks ago when she saw them at the store
[04:54.540 --> 04:56.420]  because we're big baked beans people over here.
[04:57.180 --> 04:58.560]  And, uh, extreme.
[04:59.080 --> 05:00.940]  I don't want to color Gavin's opinion.
[05:01.580 --> 05:02.440]  This is coming from a Dr.
[05:02.540 --> 05:04.580]  Pepper fan and a huge baked bean fan.
[05:04.780 --> 05:06.220]  Shall I deafen while you give the review?
[05:06.360 --> 05:07.120]  Yeah. Earmuffs.
[05:07.380 --> 05:08.080]  OK. All right.
[05:08.140 --> 05:08.940]  Tell me when to come back.
[05:09.580 --> 05:10.500]  Discount to 15 and your head will be done.
[05:10.800 --> 05:12.700]  Just watch the chat. I'll let you know when to come back.
[05:13.880 --> 05:15.020]  All right. Is he gone?
[05:15.100 --> 05:16.840]  Can you believe this fucking guy got what an idiot?
[05:16.960 --> 05:18.260]  He got married. What a moron.
[05:18.360 --> 05:19.860]  He made us fly all the way over there.
[05:19.940 --> 05:22.480]  What a goddamn Jesus Christ shit, dude.
[05:22.600 --> 05:23.800]  These these Dr.
[05:23.840 --> 05:26.580]  Pepper baked beans are some of the worst and most disappointing
[05:28.260 --> 05:29.620]  collaborations I've ever experienced.
[05:30.020 --> 05:31.020]  Other other dogs.
[05:31.200 --> 05:32.060]  That is what I expected.
[05:32.300 --> 05:34.520]  I felt like you're about to say extremely.
[05:34.520 --> 05:36.760]  And I was like, that's going to go one way or the other.
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.620]  That is going to be great or awful.
[05:39.700 --> 05:41.260]  Yeah. OK. All right.
[05:41.300 --> 05:41.820]  Here he comes.
[05:41.820 --> 05:43.620]  Oh, he's back. Oh, come back.
[05:44.120 --> 05:44.980]  What a review, Geoff.
[05:45.300 --> 05:46.240]  On the baked beans.
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.260]  And that's how I honestly feel.
[05:48.780 --> 05:49.740]  Oh, I appreciate that.
[05:49.780 --> 05:51.400]  I appreciate you being honest about the baked beans.
[05:51.720 --> 05:52.800]  I wonder what was said.
[05:53.940 --> 05:55.460]  The audience knows and you don't.
[05:55.620 --> 05:55.900]  What a mystery.
[05:55.920 --> 05:58.800]  I better eat these beans before I proof this episode.
[05:59.140 --> 05:59.900]  Nah, it's not happening.
[06:00.020 --> 06:00.760]  I don't even have them yet.
[06:00.900 --> 06:01.640]  It's going to take a while.
[06:02.560 --> 06:05.720]  That was a completely pointless exercise, considering you proof these.
[06:06.340 --> 06:07.740]  Well, I can go out and get some, can't I?
[06:08.220 --> 06:11.320]  I guess. But then what am I going to do with two cans of these fucking beans?
[06:11.320 --> 06:15.200]  I like that you don't want me to go and buy them, because otherwise you'll have two.
[06:15.640 --> 06:19.420]  Yeah. You're also never going to send them to Gavin.
[06:19.680 --> 06:21.320]  He's never going to have these beans.
[06:21.720 --> 06:25.840]  He's he's never going to listen to episode 22 of this podcast.
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.920]  That's so this this is one.
[06:29.080 --> 06:31.300]  This is an episode where I haven't heard the previous one,
[06:31.480 --> 06:35.480]  which I always like to do, but I didn't even know we'd done one.
[06:36.100 --> 06:37.100]  I don't know what you mean.
[06:37.260 --> 06:40.940]  Well, I listened to episode 20 and I was like, OK, yeah, that's where we're up to.
[06:41.320 --> 06:43.600]  No, we did 21. 21 was hot, dude.
[06:43.660 --> 06:45.300]  We were talking about it before you got here.
[06:45.620 --> 06:49.980]  Episode 21 is the one where we made Andrew explain to us why he thinks we sink.
[06:51.060 --> 06:54.440]  And then we talked about getting hit by a pitch or hit by a linebacker.
[06:54.540 --> 06:56.060]  The terminal velocity of a grape.
[06:56.440 --> 06:59.260]  We talked about the kicker, pitcher's bounds.
[06:59.420 --> 07:00.440]  Oh, yeah. Pitcher's mound.
[07:00.700 --> 07:03.820]  We talked about the open faced mash hash cash sandwich.
[07:04.280 --> 07:07.640]  And the thing that I wanted to make sure that it's not something
[07:07.640 --> 07:09.920]  that we need to bring up or whatever, but the thing that I really liked
[07:09.920 --> 07:10.780]  was the crime capsule.
[07:10.780 --> 07:12.360]  So that was all last time.
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.380]  But that's but now this is this time.
[07:14.540 --> 07:17.280]  It's like someone describing their dream.
[07:17.660 --> 07:21.120]  I don't think these episodes get baked into my brain until I listen to them.
[07:21.280 --> 07:24.300]  Like just recording them has absolutely no effect on my memory.
[07:26.160 --> 07:28.520]  You know what will have baked into your memory?
[07:29.020 --> 07:30.080]  Some Dr. Pepper beans.
[07:30.560 --> 07:31.600]  Yeah, they're going to be there.
[07:32.140 --> 07:36.800]  So we do have a lot to get to today, and we're only recording one episode.
[07:37.060 --> 07:38.480]  I have a ton of notes.
[07:38.540 --> 07:40.000]  I assume we won't get to most of them.
[07:40.800 --> 07:44.540]  I imagine there is that a certain event that may come up.
[07:44.620 --> 07:46.020]  We want to discuss a little bit.
[07:46.160 --> 07:48.540]  Eric, I had a photo you and I took for a reveal.
[07:48.700 --> 07:49.900]  I can't find it in my phone.
[07:49.980 --> 07:50.180]  I don't know.
[07:50.300 --> 07:53.380]  Do you want me to you want me to drop it in the in the thing?
[07:53.600 --> 07:54.700]  It was time.
[07:55.100 --> 07:58.220]  OK, you you let me know when I got it at the ready, boss.
[07:58.680 --> 08:01.180]  OK, well, you're talking about events, Geoff.
[08:01.640 --> 08:06.740]  I mean, the big event, you know, obviously that we got to cover is a puzzle.
[08:07.300 --> 08:09.320]  We had representatives at a puzzle tournament.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.000]  Yes. Yes, we did.
[08:11.280 --> 08:13.580]  I completely forgot about that because the other dumb thing we did.
[08:14.420 --> 08:16.540]  I was so excited.
[08:16.680 --> 08:19.580]  You recorded a piece of supplemental content for it, right?
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.780]  I did. Yeah.
[08:20.860 --> 08:24.160]  I saw the post at like 1130 p.m.
[08:24.380 --> 08:29.400]  on that day, and it was two regulation community members.
[08:29.580 --> 08:31.300]  I guess comment leavers at this point
[08:32.200 --> 08:36.460]  went to like the World Speed Competition Puzzle.
[08:36.540 --> 08:38.740]  I'm forgetting the proper name of the tournament.
[08:38.740 --> 08:40.480]  It's like the Super Bowl of Puzzle.
[08:40.500 --> 08:42.160]  It's the Super Bowl of Puzzle.
[08:42.200 --> 08:44.500]  Yeah. And they say those two words together.
[08:44.520 --> 08:47.260]  It's the big game of puzzle competition.
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.980]  It's the Super Bowl of Beans puzzle equivalent.
[08:52.180 --> 08:56.660]  And they made regulation puzzler shirts, which is very exciting.
[08:56.760 --> 09:00.300]  And in the post, they mentioned that one of them were advancing
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.140]  to the semifinals, which I thought, oh, what are those?
[09:04.180 --> 09:05.260]  I'd love to watch those.
[09:05.260 --> 09:09.320]  And I think it started at like 2 a.m.,
[09:09.860 --> 09:12.960]  so it just completely shifted my entire thing of like, OK,
[09:12.960 --> 09:14.660]  I guess I'm going to stay up till 2 a.m.
[09:14.760 --> 09:18.160]  and watch this puzzling event, which was a lot of fun.
[09:18.580 --> 09:22.720]  I've never observed anything like that.
[09:22.800 --> 09:25.720]  I'm completely disconnected from that community.
[09:26.180 --> 09:27.820]  What a community. Very wholesome.
[09:28.440 --> 09:29.760]  Very excited about puzzles.
[09:29.940 --> 09:30.800]  It was a lot of fun to watch.
[09:31.220 --> 09:35.080]  It went the way that anything related to our show would go.
[09:37.260 --> 09:39.320]  But I don't know.
[09:40.200 --> 09:43.760]  I think it's OK for me to say I don't think it ruins the supplemental in any way.
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.120]  So how these tournaments work is everybody's going simultaneously.
[09:48.440 --> 09:50.860]  It is a room filled with people.
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.780]  Imagine like 50 people sitting at desks simultaneously doing puzzles.
[09:55.980 --> 09:57.060]  It's probably even more.
[09:57.200 --> 09:59.800]  It's a lot of people and they go through it.
[09:59.940 --> 10:04.660]  And then as they solve them, they will cut to the person who did it.
[10:04.660 --> 10:06.000]  Like the moment they did it.
[10:06.060 --> 10:08.680]  So they have their little moment where they're all happy.
[10:09.260 --> 10:10.540]  Nick just has no floor puzzlers.
[10:10.700 --> 10:12.100]  No, there are no floor puzzlers.
[10:13.760 --> 10:15.940]  They cut to the people when they finish.
[10:16.120 --> 10:17.820]  They're like, yeah, look at look at us.
[10:17.880 --> 10:21.160]  And as soon as it started, I saw a regulation puzzler.
[10:21.200 --> 10:22.660]  I was all excited as calling them out.
[10:23.060 --> 10:23.860]  And we're going through.
[10:24.080 --> 10:27.060]  And as it's progressing, it's like people are showing their puzzles.
[10:27.200 --> 10:27.980]  They're all good.
[10:28.260 --> 10:32.880]  And then they started giving a lot of coverage to the regulation puzzler
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.320]  because they were right at the end and it was very exciting.
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.620]  And then they said over the broadcast, we have a special guest.
[10:41.880 --> 10:45.940]  And it cut away from the people making puzzles.
[10:46.260 --> 10:49.760]  And it was the first time they just focused on the commentary team
[10:49.760 --> 10:53.200]  and they kept their shot there for like 15 seconds
[10:53.200 --> 10:57.320]  as one of the people who solved puzzles was now going to talk about solving
[10:57.320 --> 10:57.800]  the puzzle.
[10:57.800 --> 11:02.800]  And by the time they cut back within that short 15 second window
[11:02.800 --> 11:07.340]  was when the regulation puzzler completed their puzzle and showed it up.
[11:07.580 --> 11:08.960]  There's no footage of it.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.280]  They had no moment.
[11:10.740 --> 11:14.080]  They are the only person from that.
[11:14.180 --> 11:17.260]  What I can tell that completed their puzzle
[11:17.260 --> 11:21.440]  and didn't get a little moment of like, yeah, look at me. I did it.
[11:22.660 --> 11:27.000]  Oh, no. Are we going to be relying on bootleg like crowd footage?
[11:27.560 --> 11:29.860]  If we want to see the finished puzzle that they made, yes.
[11:30.140 --> 11:33.120]  But the supplemental is me going, no, no, don't cut away.
[11:33.340 --> 11:37.040]  No. Well, surely, surely they'll cut back to them.
[11:37.200 --> 11:40.580]  And oh, and they just never we never see it.
[11:40.600 --> 11:42.380]  They're the only one I think that we don't see.
[11:42.580 --> 11:44.000]  But it was a very entertaining tournament.
[11:44.180 --> 11:46.340]  I felt inspired about doing puzzles.
[11:46.740 --> 11:50.940]  It made me feel even worse about my performance in our actual event.
[11:52.120 --> 11:54.360]  And yeah, what performance?
[11:55.180 --> 12:01.680]  My attempt. Listen, if you if you show up at the Olympics, Eric,
[12:02.380 --> 12:07.060]  if you show up at the Olympics and you jump the gun and you dive in the water
[12:07.060 --> 12:09.800]  and get disqualified, that's still a performance.
[12:10.460 --> 12:16.280]  You if if we're like, if we're likening your performance to Olympic athletes,
[12:16.280 --> 12:18.780]  you're the Australian break dancer.
[12:18.980 --> 12:23.060]  Like you gave you didn't even give your best effort.
[12:23.060 --> 12:26.600]  You just went, I'm like, what are you talking about?
[12:26.660 --> 12:28.420]  You insulted a nation.
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.720]  No, I didn't insult the nation.
[12:30.720 --> 12:34.740]  First of all, to compare me to the Australian break dancer,
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.880]  they actually like accomplished a lot.
[12:36.940 --> 12:38.740]  They got a lot of attention for their performance.
[12:38.760 --> 12:39.720]  My I did not.
[12:39.820 --> 12:42.480]  I am somebody who nobody would have even known was at the event
[12:42.480 --> 12:45.380]  was my level of how my performance came out.
[12:45.720 --> 12:49.820]  There was a lot of effort put in to what came out.
[12:49.820 --> 12:53.540]  Well, most of the effort was cleaning your table off.
[12:54.020 --> 12:57.220]  I spent over an hour trying to make a puzzle.
[12:57.480 --> 12:58.080]  Does it count?
[12:58.560 --> 13:00.540]  You don't get gold medal for buying your.
[13:00.700 --> 13:02.980]  I'm not asking for a gold medal.
[13:03.300 --> 13:07.940]  I'm saying I disqualified at the event and barely showed up.
[13:08.260 --> 13:09.880]  Who's saying I want a gold medal?
[13:11.040 --> 13:14.380]  I just don't know how you can classify that as effort towards the thing.
[13:14.840 --> 13:18.120]  Well, I spent more effort than you did on it.
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.760]  Oh, I didn't take a photo.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.120]  Can you explain how?
[13:23.560 --> 13:26.760]  I spent more time trying to build the puzzle than you did.
[13:27.640 --> 13:28.920]  At least equal.
[13:30.640 --> 13:34.400]  Guys, I think we might need to have another puzzle off.
[13:34.620 --> 13:36.100]  We do, but it's spicy.
[13:36.840 --> 13:40.600]  Can we can we pick a puzzle where the edges on all the exact same?
[13:40.820 --> 13:43.220]  We can. I'll tell you what, we'll pick an easier puzzle.
[13:43.400 --> 13:47.680]  I I just thought the bears looked sweet staring at the sunset,
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.060]  but it was it was a goddamn difficult puzzle, even for me,
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.740]  a regulation, constant puzzler.
[13:53.840 --> 13:56.020]  So I will pick the next 500 piece puzzle.
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.360]  I'll make sure everybody agrees on it first.
[13:58.500 --> 14:01.300]  And then we'll but we'll we'll get that going in the background. Absolutely.
[14:01.960 --> 14:03.620]  Yeah, I can't wait. I'm going to listen.
[14:03.680 --> 14:04.520]  This is going to be serious.
[14:05.080 --> 14:07.920]  I felt inspired to you.
[14:07.960 --> 14:08.440]  OK, great.
[14:11.200 --> 14:14.480]  While while we're while we're talking about how awesome our audience is,
[14:15.060 --> 14:16.660]  I just wanted to give a quick shout out.
[14:16.660 --> 14:20.140]  I don't think I mentioned this in twenty one, but we recorded it like a year ago.
[14:20.160 --> 14:20.880]  So it's hard to remember.
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.460]  A couple of weeks ago, a regulation listener,
[14:24.580 --> 14:28.620]  well, I guess comment weaver reached out to me via via the Saul Wright email
[14:28.620 --> 14:31.800]  to let me know that they work for Alice Cooper, the musician,
[14:32.400 --> 14:35.780]  and that they're they're going to be in town in Austin for a big Alice Cooper show
[14:35.780 --> 14:38.780]  and offered offered a regulation tickets.
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.140]  If we wanted to go, nobody else was available.
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.480]  So Emily and Burndog and Vanessa and I went.
[14:44.600 --> 14:45.120]  I was available.
[14:45.600 --> 14:48.560]  You didn't respond in the fucking text chat.
[14:48.960 --> 14:51.340]  It was in slack for 24 hours.
[14:51.340 --> 14:52.640]  It was. It's true.
[14:52.800 --> 14:53.380]  He did. Yeah.
[14:53.460 --> 14:54.060]  What did it say?
[14:54.280 --> 14:56.980]  It said, would anyone like to go to the show with me?
[14:57.020 --> 14:59.040]  I need to know in the next 24 hours.
[14:59.100 --> 15:00.300]  I'm going to give the tickets away.
[15:00.620 --> 15:04.080]  Now. Now, Gavin, what did you want to say?
[15:05.780 --> 15:08.860]  I just thought it was I thought for some reason I thought you said
[15:08.860 --> 15:10.340]  I'm going to see Alice Cooper.
[15:10.900 --> 15:13.680]  And so Gavin wants a gold medal for his interaction.
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.280]  I'm not trying to place on Alice Cooper.
[15:19.780 --> 15:22.160]  Anyway, it was a fucking awesome show.
[15:22.280 --> 15:24.660]  I'm going to do a whole bunch of Alice Cooper content over on Soul Ride
[15:24.660 --> 15:27.660]  because I fell in love with 76 year old Alice Cooper,
[15:27.660 --> 15:31.720]  who looks younger than I do, by the way, and is an inspiration as a
[15:31.720 --> 15:35.600]  as a as a creative artist, because that guy is just as good at 76
[15:35.600 --> 15:38.120]  as he was in his 40s when I was growing up.
[15:38.800 --> 15:40.160]  And it was an awesome time.
[15:40.180 --> 15:43.380]  But I really just wanted to say thank you to Riley, who got us the tickets
[15:43.380 --> 15:45.500]  and who we got to hang out with for a little bit after the show.
[15:45.680 --> 15:46.760]  Awesome. Awesome, dude.
[15:46.800 --> 15:48.020]  And really appreciate it.
[15:48.020 --> 15:50.480]  And what a fucking amazing community we have.
[15:50.660 --> 15:53.380]  Did Alice Cooper get decapitated in your show?
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.180]  Yes, he did. Oh, hell yeah.
[15:55.600 --> 15:56.940]  I saw a clip of that. That's awesome.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.380]  Does his head come off a lot?
[15:59.300 --> 16:02.280]  Yeah, well, his head only came off once, but I got dude,
[16:02.320 --> 16:04.640]  I got a ton of Alice Cooper fucking images.
[16:04.940 --> 16:07.020]  It was such a cool visually show.
[16:07.420 --> 16:09.540]  I'll just throw these up in the chat so I can remember to put them in the.
[16:10.200 --> 16:12.200]  Yeah, I was so happy, Geoff,
[16:12.200 --> 16:13.400]  when you posted the photo.
[16:13.620 --> 16:15.900]  I don't remember if it was in our Slack or text chain, whatever.
[16:16.040 --> 16:19.280]  But you you shared previous that you were at this concert reading
[16:19.280 --> 16:21.600]  as someone who properly read your message.
[16:21.680 --> 16:24.520]  I interpreted it as you may not be going.
[16:24.660 --> 16:27.140]  And so to see you at the show. Very exciting.
[16:27.560 --> 16:28.880]  Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to,
[16:28.920 --> 16:30.960]  because it was like right before we left for England
[16:31.360 --> 16:33.740]  and it was a little inconvenient because of that.
[16:33.820 --> 16:37.260]  But I just it was such a cool offer and I really wanted to make it happen.
[16:38.120 --> 16:41.840]  And I'm so glad we did, because it was it was like
[16:41.840 --> 16:43.580]  really impressive, too, by the way.
[16:43.980 --> 16:46.840]  I mean, for just as a stage show, impressive,
[16:47.100 --> 16:49.820]  let alone the fact that the dude's in his mid 70s
[16:49.820 --> 16:53.060]  and he does like five different wardrobe changes.
[16:53.540 --> 16:56.200]  He's there's a fucking giant Frankenstein's monster
[16:56.200 --> 16:57.280]  that runs around the stage.
[16:57.600 --> 17:00.520]  He gets up on a big shit, doesn't he?
[17:00.800 --> 17:02.040]  Yeah, he does. He got all kinds of stuff.
[17:02.100 --> 17:04.000]  But anyway, I just need that for thumbnail and stuff.
[17:04.020 --> 17:04.760]  So I put all that in there.
[17:05.300 --> 17:06.680]  Yeah, a bunch of awesome images.
[17:06.920 --> 17:08.580]  Going to delete that from my notes.
[17:08.580 --> 17:11.660]  And then I was thinking about going
[17:12.400 --> 17:17.040]  to the overseas guys went to England for an I really appreciate.
[17:17.140 --> 17:17.900]  I thought it was a great idea.
[17:18.180 --> 17:21.260]  We talked about the crime capsule last episode.
[17:21.760 --> 17:24.840]  Y'all all went overseas to do some crime so they couldn't
[17:24.840 --> 17:27.660]  they couldn't hold them against you in your own country.
[17:27.660 --> 17:28.380]  I believe. Right.
[17:28.400 --> 17:31.200]  That was the whole idea as the basis of the trip.
[17:32.960 --> 17:34.000]  International crimes.
[17:34.580 --> 17:37.120]  Gavin. Yes.
[17:38.780 --> 17:41.020]  That would have been a it's kind of your thing.
[17:41.500 --> 17:42.620]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[17:42.680 --> 17:43.620]  Crimes overseas.
[17:44.440 --> 17:45.340]  We talk about crimes.
[17:45.680 --> 17:46.140]  Why? Why?
[17:46.240 --> 17:47.640]  I think the crime capsule.
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.640]  I was clearly making a joke about the fact that you guys were all overseas
[17:51.640 --> 17:53.900]  and that you were actually there for the wedding.
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.800]  But I was setting it up as if it was a different event.
[17:57.400 --> 17:59.180]  He wants a gold medal for his joke, Gavin.
[17:59.780 --> 18:02.460]  No, it's just explain the joke because he was confused by it.
[18:02.480 --> 18:05.260]  I was so scared of stepping on the punch line to your joke that I was.
[18:05.860 --> 18:06.700]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:06.700 --> 18:08.020]  That was listen. That was it.
[18:08.020 --> 18:10.360]  I was just as how has he got married?
[18:10.860 --> 18:12.500]  How much of that do you think made the episode?
[18:12.740 --> 18:15.040]  All of it. Every single moment of it.
[18:16.280 --> 18:17.100]  A hundred percent of it.
[18:17.260 --> 18:18.840]  Serve me up with the crime shit again.
[18:22.320 --> 18:24.980]  Anyway, that's a but that's enough about the community.
[18:25.440 --> 18:27.380]  Andrew, you wanted to say something about the crime capsule?
[18:27.800 --> 18:29.620]  Already said it and nailed it.
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.020]  Gavin isn't talking about his wife is the issue.
[18:33.560 --> 18:35.080]  I got married. Yeah.
[18:35.600 --> 18:37.020]  Congrats. Oh, my God.
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.460]  Oh, man. Oh, did I?
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.180]  If any of that's in, that is all of it.
[18:44.300 --> 18:46.780]  Do not remove any of it.
[18:47.480 --> 18:48.040]  Thanks.
[18:49.160 --> 18:53.000]  The episode was going so well there for a while, I felt it was humming.
[18:53.340 --> 18:54.980]  Really? It was humming along.
[18:55.280 --> 18:57.480]  Great. Like the wedding did, I assume.
[18:57.920 --> 18:59.300]  Good old hum to that wedding.
[18:59.820 --> 19:00.820]  Gavin got married.
[19:01.100 --> 19:05.040]  Our little our little Gabby Wavy, who I've known since he was
[19:05.600 --> 19:11.500]  just about just turned 15 after all this time, finally got married.
[19:12.220 --> 19:13.300]  Congratulations, buddy.
[19:13.580 --> 19:18.240]  That completes our friendship story arc that I was going for when I was 14, I guess.
[19:19.660 --> 19:21.180]  So what's your next story arc?
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.380]  Is that it? Are we done?
[19:22.640 --> 19:24.660]  I thought maybe that was the end of the friendship.
[19:26.980 --> 19:29.380]  No, we've now been each other's best man.
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.840]  I don't think a lot of people can say that.
[19:31.220 --> 19:32.460]  That's true. It is true.
[19:32.460 --> 19:37.580]  It was it was such an honor, such a genuine honor to get to be your best man.
[19:37.680 --> 19:41.880]  And I want you to know I put more work into getting that right
[19:41.880 --> 19:44.280]  than just about anything else I've done in my life.
[19:44.820 --> 19:49.720]  It was I was it was it was I was beyond excited.
[19:50.100 --> 19:51.600]  You're an amazing best man.
[19:51.700 --> 19:55.340]  I had several conversations afterwards with different family members,
[19:55.900 --> 19:58.820]  and I just listened to my family praise you for
[20:00.500 --> 20:01.280]  multiple minutes.
[20:01.740 --> 20:04.700]  Your family and I are on very good terms right now.
[20:04.840 --> 20:06.280]  We like each other a lot.
[20:06.400 --> 20:09.640]  We're in a we're in a deep like relationship right now.
[20:09.680 --> 20:12.340]  They are the fucking deep.
[20:13.160 --> 20:15.300]  Yeah, I like them. I like them intensely.
[20:15.960 --> 20:16.980]  They're fucking awesome.
[20:17.080 --> 20:19.020]  I'm gonna go stay with your grandparents next time I'm in London.
[20:19.140 --> 20:19.420]  It's a whole.
[20:21.260 --> 20:24.180]  Yeah, I think he did invite a few people.
[20:25.520 --> 20:26.260]  That's great.
[20:27.580 --> 20:29.860]  My family also put in some reviews
[20:30.520 --> 20:33.480]  on some of the various goings on at the wedding.
[20:33.480 --> 20:34.700]  Oh, really? Yeah.
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.260]  Love this guy.
[20:40.600 --> 20:41.800]  It's a picture of Eric dancing.
[20:42.620 --> 20:45.100]  He definitely seemed to be having a great time.
[20:46.120 --> 20:50.220]  Just like my family were praising you, Geoff.
[20:50.420 --> 20:54.300]  I had several members of my family say, hey, hey, come and look at this.
[20:57.820 --> 21:02.640]  And it was just Eric just going ape shit on the dance floor like he does at weddings.
[21:02.920 --> 21:06.100]  You had a great you had a you had a you had a pretty good DJ.
[21:06.200 --> 21:08.380]  He was playing he was playing like a lot of 80s hits.
[21:08.440 --> 21:10.900]  I don't know where like I don't know what your must plays were
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.680]  or like what the vibe was that you told them.
[21:12.740 --> 21:15.900]  But man, when he was like deep in the 80s, pretty good stuff.
[21:16.120 --> 21:18.180]  Pretty, pretty good. Yeah, that was that was pretty much
[21:18.700 --> 21:20.140]  the only thing I submitted to him.
[21:20.360 --> 21:23.420]  You did great. Those were yeah, he played some great hits.
[21:23.420 --> 21:26.440]  I will say album versions of a lot of stuff, a lot of album.
[21:26.480 --> 21:28.340]  You ever heard the full song or something?
[21:28.760 --> 21:30.020]  Boy, he was doing it.
[21:30.140 --> 21:33.100]  But is that is that why in one of the videos
[21:33.100 --> 21:36.880]  you're just dancing around and then randomly for no reason,
[21:36.980 --> 21:39.140]  you just start screaming at the top of your lungs.
[21:39.620 --> 21:41.860]  Hey, they never play this version.
[21:41.940 --> 21:43.840]  Yeah, they play the long version.
[21:44.080 --> 21:46.260]  Yeah, it's like when you hear
[21:46.780 --> 21:50.700]  Get Lucky by Daft Punk at a wedding or at like something,
[21:50.700 --> 21:54.340]  you assume it's going to be about 90 seconds because it is just that's
[21:54.340 --> 21:57.520]  what it's made for to be mixed into like the next thing.
[21:58.020 --> 22:00.020]  This guy went five minutes, 50 seconds.
[22:00.220 --> 22:02.320]  You want to hear every fucking one of them.
[22:02.660 --> 22:05.240]  And it was the album version.
[22:05.460 --> 22:08.140]  It was I think Jessica Negri was was going around.
[22:08.260 --> 22:11.960]  She messaged me and she's like, I have so many videos of you dancing.
[22:11.960 --> 22:13.860]  And I just said, you're welcome.
[22:15.340 --> 22:18.780]  I will say of all the Madonna songs, Papa, don't preach.
[22:18.780 --> 22:20.420]  Crazy pick at a wedding.
[22:20.440 --> 22:23.560]  What an absolutely insane choice.
[22:24.020 --> 22:24.920]  What an insane choice.
[22:25.520 --> 22:28.840]  I did pick originally like a prayer, but I got the feedback
[22:28.840 --> 22:31.400]  that it was overplayed because of the Wolverine movie.
[22:31.700 --> 22:32.880]  Oh, I could see that.
[22:33.520 --> 22:35.600]  There was a kid who did the whole NSYNC dance,
[22:35.620 --> 22:39.040]  who definitely was too young to watch Deadpool, but saw the fuck out of Deadpool.
[22:39.560 --> 22:42.160]  Boy, he saw Deadpool and he knew the dance.
[22:42.300 --> 22:43.120]  It was pretty cool.
[22:44.160 --> 22:47.120]  Is this the all sharing photos portion of the wedding?
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.880]  Because I have one I want to share as well.
[22:49.180 --> 22:54.480]  Somebody caught this photo of Gavin at right as I'm giving my speech.
[22:54.540 --> 22:57.380]  And in the speech, I say it's at the moment I say
[22:58.080 --> 23:01.080]  for the next six and a half minutes, you're going to have to listen to me cry
[23:01.080 --> 23:01.540]  or whatever.
[23:01.720 --> 23:04.580]  And that's Gavin's reaction to realizing my speech was six minutes.
[23:06.840 --> 23:08.240]  Mine was not that long.
[23:08.320 --> 23:09.820]  What's going on in your head there, Gav?
[23:10.740 --> 23:13.720]  Oh, man, I'm going to have to read mine slower because
[23:13.720 --> 23:17.380]  because that's going to make mine seem real short.
[23:17.760 --> 23:19.780]  Your speech was perfect, man.
[23:19.940 --> 23:22.480]  I was like afraid you were like, oh, God, I'm going to listen to this guy
[23:22.480 --> 23:24.060]  drone on for six fucking minutes.
[23:24.500 --> 23:25.600]  No, I was just worried about mine.
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.100]  It was great.
[23:28.260 --> 23:29.860]  The food was so good.
[23:30.100 --> 23:34.480]  Never been to a wedding where we all sat at one long table.
[23:34.840 --> 23:38.740]  That should be the default for weddings.
[23:39.100 --> 23:40.500]  That was awesome.
[23:41.020 --> 23:41.740]  Totally agree.
[23:41.740 --> 23:43.860]  Also, everybody had Turkish delight.
[23:44.020 --> 23:44.700]  It was delicious.
[23:44.900 --> 23:47.360]  Oh, Gavin, Gavin loves Turkish delight, dude.
[23:47.400 --> 23:48.320]  That's like his thing.
[23:48.500 --> 23:49.240]  He loves it.
[23:49.260 --> 23:51.380]  It was like in the in the ice cream, right?
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.900]  It was like on like the ice cream was on top of it.
[23:53.980 --> 23:55.240]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
[23:55.960 --> 23:58.520]  Hey, Eric, also,
[23:59.860 --> 24:03.340]  the the boys did a little a little something.
[24:03.620 --> 24:04.400]  I think we can talk about.
[24:04.560 --> 24:07.020]  There was a there was a fun little addition to the wedding.
[24:07.100 --> 24:10.060]  We wanted to make it a little regulation-esque
[24:10.060 --> 24:13.380]  and Andrew and Nick, you're not aware of this,
[24:13.500 --> 24:16.280]  but I thought it might be I thought it might be fun
[24:16.280 --> 24:20.620]  if I brought a friend with me to the wedding as a surprise.
[24:20.700 --> 24:22.920]  Didn't tell Eric or Gavin or anybody ahead of time
[24:22.920 --> 24:26.900]  and surprise them on the day with a little bit of extra wedding
[24:26.900 --> 24:28.880]  jewelry for us all to wear.
[24:29.200 --> 24:33.140]  You see in the photo there, I might be wearing a certain Vegas
[24:33.140 --> 24:34.140]  Ricky's watch.
[24:34.520 --> 24:39.700]  I've got I've got his wrist, his wristlet and his class ring
[24:39.700 --> 24:44.300]  on that Neptune high, baby, all the way
[24:44.300 --> 24:48.220]  because we're going snake eyes style at the wedding.
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.180]  And Gavin, you we didn't get a photo of it, but what was around your neck
[24:52.180 --> 24:53.740]  as you got married to Meg?
[24:54.120 --> 24:56.760]  I was wearing the necklace. Yeah.
[24:58.720 --> 25:02.760]  Does Meg know you got married with Nicholas around your neck?
[25:03.500 --> 25:07.860]  Well, I she did it until later that night where I was getting undressed
[25:07.860 --> 25:09.580]  and we'd finished, it was like 1 a.m.
[25:09.900 --> 25:13.460]  I just started unbuttoning and she was like, Jesus, what's that?
[25:13.500 --> 25:17.020]  And I was like, I thought I had like food down me or something.
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.280]  And I was like, oh, my God, it's the neck, it's the Nick Cage necklace.
[25:22.500 --> 25:24.200]  Oh, man. She was OK with that?
[25:24.380 --> 25:24.780]  Didn't make her mad?
[25:25.560 --> 25:26.940]  Uh, no, I think she was fine with it.
[25:27.060 --> 25:29.300]  Well, I also it was completely invisible for the. Yeah.
[25:30.020 --> 25:32.480]  I think if it started like creeping into pictures,
[25:32.540 --> 25:34.180]  there would have been some conversation about it.
[25:34.220 --> 25:36.200]  Yeah. Yeah. I get that. I was nervous.
[25:36.560 --> 25:37.720]  It's one of those things where I thought,
[25:37.720 --> 25:43.260]  I'm going to bring over across the ocean this jewelry we just bought after
[25:44.520 --> 25:46.680]  after all of the kerfuffle of getting it.
[25:46.780 --> 25:49.060]  And I don't know that the guys are going to appreciate this.
[25:49.160 --> 25:50.980]  So I was a little nervous to show it to Eric.
[25:51.120 --> 25:52.760]  Are you kidding me? This is OK, right? Yeah.
[25:52.800 --> 25:55.100]  Do you understand how fast I took that photo?
[25:55.440 --> 25:57.900]  Also, I call that photo tax write off.
[26:00.700 --> 26:03.580]  And then it's like, you know, is Meg going to find it funny
[26:03.580 --> 26:06.660]  that we're bringing movie props to her wedding and making her husband
[26:06.660 --> 26:09.160]  get buried in them? You know, it's so cool.
[26:09.720 --> 26:11.740]  But I'm glad we did it. I'm really glad we did it.
[26:11.740 --> 26:13.380]  Oh, so funny. She found it funny.
[26:13.440 --> 26:16.580]  And I think the fact that there was a slight amount of fear in the whole thing
[26:16.580 --> 26:20.200]  made it so much funnier when you presented it like a like
[26:20.200 --> 26:21.620]  you were opening a box of cocaine.
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.820]  He did the same thing to me.
[26:25.100 --> 26:26.080]  It was so cool.
[26:26.160 --> 26:29.480]  It was like looking over both shoulders before popping the topper.
[26:29.620 --> 26:29.800]  Yep.
[26:33.260 --> 26:34.540]  It was really fun.
[26:34.540 --> 26:37.380]  It wasn't like a very stuffy wedding or anything.
[26:37.500 --> 26:39.220]  It was like it like a really nice estate.
[26:39.460 --> 26:41.300]  I think everyone had a really good time.
[26:42.180 --> 26:45.500]  Geoff wore a great hat and it was just a lot of fun.
[26:45.980 --> 26:50.120]  I did. We were trying to have the whole thing outside,
[26:50.300 --> 26:52.440]  but in the morning it was looking like it was going to rain.
[26:52.740 --> 26:54.980]  And I was all for risky and just doing outside.
[26:55.320 --> 26:58.180]  But I guess when there's like a string quartet,
[26:58.220 --> 26:59.620]  they don't want to get all their shit wet.
[26:59.700 --> 27:02.280]  So they were like, let's play it safe and do it inside.
[27:02.660 --> 27:04.000]  So that meant that we could do it.
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.240]  We could do it indoors and we could do our our little joke that we did where
[27:08.840 --> 27:11.060]  as we were doing the the signing stuff,
[27:11.160 --> 27:14.160]  because like we're doing real legal marriage stuff in the middle of the wedding,
[27:14.220 --> 27:16.500]  which is, I think, common for English weddings.
[27:16.860 --> 27:21.240]  But we just had the string quartet start playing the Reigns of Castamere,
[27:21.300 --> 27:23.600]  which is the red wedding music from Game of Thrones.
[27:24.360 --> 27:25.740]  That's like a funny little bit.
[27:26.180 --> 27:28.860]  And then I then I realized what I was doing, all the signing,
[27:28.960 --> 27:31.900]  like it really gets really loud and dramatic.
[27:31.900 --> 27:36.460]  And the doors were closed and it did start to get quite sinister.
[27:36.580 --> 27:39.760]  I was worried that it was a little bit too extreme, like a little bit.
[27:40.140 --> 27:42.480]  Andrew, it's so weird.
[27:42.760 --> 27:45.420]  A British wedding is so formal.
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.400]  There's someone from like a registrar's office who has to like be present.
[27:50.680 --> 27:51.840]  You do the whole ceremony.
[27:52.320 --> 27:53.340]  You say, I do.
[27:53.440 --> 27:55.020]  And then you have to say, I am.
[27:55.120 --> 27:56.400]  And I've never heard that before.
[27:56.940 --> 28:01.080]  But yeah, the thing that really got me is I'm going to just send it.
[28:01.080 --> 28:03.940]  This is not the photo of them getting married, but this is sort of what it was.
[28:04.080 --> 28:08.500]  OK, there's like you have to sit there and watch them sign paperwork.
[28:08.500 --> 28:13.480]  And then they like take a picture of them having signed paperwork at the table.
[28:13.480 --> 28:18.040]  And it is the most like depression era
[28:18.800 --> 28:19.920]  wedding photo.
[28:20.460 --> 28:24.760]  It's so just like this is the one that the English grandparents
[28:24.760 --> 28:30.460]  like hang in the living room and be like, oh, sorry to be so sentimental.
[28:30.460 --> 28:32.300]  Oh, it's me and mom getting married.
[28:32.500 --> 28:34.720]  And it's them signing paperwork.
[28:34.980 --> 28:36.240]  It's so crazy.
[28:36.500 --> 28:42.560]  Also, imagine the most beautiful room with a gorgeous arch of flowers.
[28:43.120 --> 28:47.020]  And Gavin and Meg both look the best they've ever looked in their entire lives.
[28:47.220 --> 28:50.540]  Standing there with the lady that's marrying him and everybody around them
[28:50.540 --> 28:52.860]  in this beautiful, glowing environment.
[28:53.020 --> 28:56.380]  And then to the left is just a round folding table
[28:56.380 --> 29:00.480]  with a lady filling out long form paperwork very fucking seriously,
[29:00.480 --> 29:05.040]  like she's doing taxes the entire time without breaking or looking up,
[29:05.100 --> 29:07.060]  just crunching it out because it's got to be done.
[29:07.340 --> 29:09.220]  Like I think they have to sync it up at the right time or something
[29:09.220 --> 29:12.100]  so that when they say I do, I am she hits the stamp or something.
[29:12.500 --> 29:13.420]  It was weird.
[29:13.800 --> 29:17.200]  Yeah. And I was just like verifying all the contact information.
[29:17.200 --> 29:18.740]  It was like I was buying a plane ticket.
[29:18.760 --> 29:21.640]  It was like everyone sat down and watched me like buy a house.
[29:22.380 --> 29:23.640]  That's exactly Gavin.
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.900]  It's exactly like you were closing on a house.
[29:27.100 --> 29:31.360]  Yes. Being in the audience was like watching you sign the final paperwork
[29:31.360 --> 29:33.340]  so you can move into your home.
[29:33.340 --> 29:36.480]  It is so it's so weird.
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.640]  I can't like the wedding is interrupted by paperwork for an extended period of time.
[29:41.700 --> 29:44.000]  Yeah, they literally like chat amongst themselves.
[29:44.300 --> 29:48.260]  But then I got so distracted and I couldn't I couldn't read what I was writing
[29:48.260 --> 29:50.560]  because the range of cast of it was so loud.
[29:54.720 --> 29:56.060]  Oh, that's really funny.
[29:57.000 --> 29:58.780]  Oh, God, it was it was awesome.
[29:59.000 --> 30:00.320]  And then we danced for a long time.
[30:00.940 --> 30:02.200]  English weddings are long.
[30:02.480 --> 30:04.220]  English weddings are in a good way.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.740]  Yeah. Oh, I had a great time.
[30:05.800 --> 30:06.740]  It was paced out really well.
[30:06.740 --> 30:07.720]  And I had like a lot of fun.
[30:07.800 --> 30:10.800]  It's just like, Jesus, dude, like that's an all day affair.
[30:11.200 --> 30:12.400]  I spent most of it talking to people.
[30:12.400 --> 30:14.700]  So I was only just like kind of passing through the dance floor.
[30:15.020 --> 30:16.500]  But there was one bit where you would
[30:18.080 --> 30:20.460]  you were just screaming at the top of your lungs
[30:20.460 --> 30:22.080]  at the painting that was on the wall.
[30:22.080 --> 30:23.200]  Oh, my God.
[30:23.440 --> 30:27.540]  There's just it's there's a guy there's like a painting of like
[30:27.540 --> 30:29.240]  what looks like Lyndon B.
[30:29.320 --> 30:31.560]  Johnson overlooking this dance floor.
[30:31.640 --> 30:37.060]  And like everything about it was like if I if this guy was a ghost
[30:37.060 --> 30:41.100]  watching me right now, he would be so disappointed about what his estate became
[30:41.100 --> 30:46.240]  because it was it was not made for what I was doing on the dance floor.
[30:47.940 --> 30:49.940]  And then I was I was at the bar.
[30:50.040 --> 30:51.920]  I was just trying to get a drink, I think.
[30:51.920 --> 30:55.860]  And then you came like stumbling in and all your hair was all crazy.
[30:56.040 --> 30:58.940]  And then you just went straight to the water
[30:58.940 --> 31:01.920]  and you just started pouring the biggest glass of water.
[31:02.120 --> 31:04.980]  Like you just dehydrated on the dance floor.
[31:05.460 --> 31:09.140]  I drank so much fucking sparkling water at that wedding
[31:09.140 --> 31:13.040]  because I would pour a whole glass and then drink it and go wrong one.
[31:13.220 --> 31:15.760]  And then I would have a glass of still water right afterward.
[31:16.280 --> 31:17.560]  Happened three times at least.
[31:18.520 --> 31:20.320]  Oh, it was fun.
[31:20.320 --> 31:22.220]  Had a great time, like an amazing time.
[31:22.480 --> 31:24.220]  It was a really, really, really great wedding.
[31:24.340 --> 31:25.940]  It was it was lovely.
[31:26.320 --> 31:28.500]  Meg had like four outfit changes.
[31:28.780 --> 31:30.300]  It was so awesome.
[31:30.500 --> 31:33.640]  Like, yeah, Meg was awesome through like the whole thing.
[31:33.660 --> 31:35.960]  It was beautiful. It was it was so much fun.
[31:36.040 --> 31:36.540]  It was a blast.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.100]  It was genuinely such a just such a great experience all the way around.
[31:42.200 --> 31:44.420]  However, it started off a little I was thinking about this
[31:44.420 --> 31:45.400]  this morning, I was collecting my notes.
[31:45.420 --> 31:48.300]  It started off on a bit of a wrong foot for me
[31:48.820 --> 31:52.680]  in the sense that everybody was kind of in town for a couple of days before.
[31:52.860 --> 31:56.620]  And then the night before the wedding, Emily and I moved into
[31:56.620 --> 32:00.100]  a little temporary house with Gavin Meg, sort of like a
[32:00.100 --> 32:02.980]  I don't like a hangout spot the night before and before the wedding
[32:02.980 --> 32:04.240]  where we spend time together.
[32:04.380 --> 32:06.780]  And I was sitting in the room trying to get comfortable
[32:06.780 --> 32:08.520]  drinking, drinking a little bit of water.
[32:08.560 --> 32:11.280]  And Gavin walked in and I thought, oh, I want to impress him
[32:11.280 --> 32:12.460]  because it's the first time I'd seen him.
[32:12.560 --> 32:17.500]  So I read, I I raised up on my chair to fart and shit my pants hard
[32:18.060 --> 32:18.300]  immediately.
[32:20.040 --> 32:23.720]  The second I saw Gavin, I tried to fart and just shit my pants.
[32:24.120 --> 32:26.260]  No, I didn't think he even made a noise.
[32:26.380 --> 32:29.620]  You were just like, I just came in and you're like, shit myself.
[32:30.500 --> 32:32.440]  And I had to just run to the bathroom.
[32:32.760 --> 32:34.180]  Oh, my God. Wow.
[32:34.380 --> 32:36.400]  Yeah, that's crazy. Oh my God.
[32:37.660 --> 32:40.680]  Well, speaking of speaking of shit,
[32:41.040 --> 32:44.760]  this was like the only photo my wife took of her time in England.
[32:45.280 --> 32:48.700]  Uh, and it was of the toilet in our hotel room.
[32:48.760 --> 32:51.480]  And it was that. The Game of Thrones toilet, we called it.
[32:51.680 --> 32:57.640]  What the fuck kind of Tyrion Lannister assassination throne is that?
[32:57.980 --> 32:59.680]  What is ridiculous?
[33:00.460 --> 33:01.300]  Ridiculous. Great.
[33:01.860 --> 33:04.840]  I like the idea of it being a wooden box over it.
[33:04.900 --> 33:08.440]  Like you could custom you could throw a Doritos logo on that thing.
[33:08.540 --> 33:10.480]  You could you could have different face plates.
[33:10.740 --> 33:13.640]  Like a 360 face. Yeah, like a 360 console.
[33:14.080 --> 33:17.080]  You can do that with your regular.
[33:17.260 --> 33:19.460]  You're talking about a toilet seat.
[33:20.060 --> 33:20.540]  No, no, no, no.
[33:20.540 --> 33:23.700]  Where would the face plate go on the what are you talking about?
[33:23.800 --> 33:28.820]  See how it's wood, how it's like there's a wooden box around it covering the porcelain.
[33:29.100 --> 33:31.080]  They're not showing the porcelain.
[33:31.080 --> 33:33.620]  So like it would be snap on, snap off to that.
[33:33.800 --> 33:35.640]  That's like the the face plate.
[33:36.220 --> 33:38.820]  Yeah, that would have like the Gears of War logo on it. Yeah.
[33:40.400 --> 33:43.920]  While we're showing fucking weird British pictures,
[33:44.440 --> 33:46.820]  Emily and I walked into a pub because that's where everybody eats in England.
[33:47.120 --> 33:49.520]  And so we both fucking were stopped in our tracks.
[33:49.600 --> 33:51.380]  I'd never seen anything like this before.
[33:51.440 --> 33:52.200]  I'm going to show this to you guys.
[33:53.040 --> 33:57.160]  All of the ketchup was at the exact same level.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.320]  That's that's crazy.
[33:59.700 --> 34:01.460]  That's how does that happen?
[34:01.740 --> 34:04.980]  I'm sure there's a picture of twenty five bottles of ketchup.
[34:05.040 --> 34:06.280]  It's like a P. Diddy party.
[34:06.520 --> 34:08.000]  But instead of baby oil, it's ketchup.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.520]  And they all have like an eighth of a bottle left.
[34:10.580 --> 34:12.420]  But it's a uniform across the board.
[34:12.480 --> 34:13.220]  How does that happen?
[34:13.460 --> 34:17.740]  I think I've only ever used ketchup in a restaurant or a pub at that level.
[34:18.900 --> 34:20.380]  I've never had a full one.
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.140]  That must be a British thing, because we looked at it for like five minutes.
[34:24.300 --> 34:25.460]  Just it floored us.
[34:25.820 --> 34:28.620]  Do you think there's someone there who's a real big fan of rotation?
[34:28.740 --> 34:30.120]  He's like trying to keep all the levels the same.
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.300]  Oh, absolutely. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:33.460 --> 34:35.080]  I think Nick really appreciates it.
[34:35.320 --> 34:36.780]  I think Nick sees it and he's like, this is good.
[34:36.780 --> 34:39.260]  There's some symmetry there that is otherworldly.
[34:39.360 --> 34:40.600]  Also, we watched TV.
[34:40.760 --> 34:43.840]  We watched one game show at night before we went to bed one night.
[34:43.960 --> 34:47.320]  And I completely and totally understand Gavin in a new way.
[34:47.700 --> 34:48.280]  Oh, yeah.
[34:48.640 --> 34:51.440]  It was a show, a British show about words.
[34:52.100 --> 34:55.120]  And you have to pick out the meaning of the words.
[34:55.220 --> 34:58.120]  These are the words in the British game show.
[34:58.440 --> 35:01.080]  Twifler. Testicle. Twifler. Twinkle.
[35:01.520 --> 35:03.800]  Throttle bottom. Tootsie cum.
[35:03.800 --> 35:05.200]  What? I can't even see that.
[35:05.400 --> 35:06.980]  Who leaked my next Worms theme?
[35:07.220 --> 35:07.900]  Twaddle basket.
[35:10.220 --> 35:11.260]  Twaddle basket.
[35:12.640 --> 35:14.660]  Throttle, throttle bottom.
[35:15.320 --> 35:18.580]  What? What the hell?
[35:19.220 --> 35:21.420]  I get you, Gav. I understand now.
[35:21.520 --> 35:22.540]  You're not weird.
[35:22.640 --> 35:24.080]  You just watch TV in England.
[35:24.400 --> 35:24.960]  I'm just average.
[35:26.940 --> 35:29.520]  It was a lot of fun.
[35:29.720 --> 35:31.300]  I thought being in England was really good.
[35:31.300 --> 35:35.920]  Did you ever talk about the custom drink that you guys had, Gavin?
[35:36.340 --> 35:39.980]  No, we we we were going to do a bunch of custom cocktails
[35:40.700 --> 35:43.260]  based on cat puns from our cat's names.
[35:43.480 --> 35:47.960]  And then it was really expensive to add a custom cocktail
[35:47.960 --> 35:49.680]  because I guess they have to buy extra shit.
[35:50.040 --> 35:53.300]  So we just did one and we called it the Long Island Iced Smee.
[35:53.820 --> 35:55.960]  It was so good.
[35:56.100 --> 35:58.000]  I think I had I think I had two.
[35:58.400 --> 35:59.560]  They were fantastic.
[36:00.180 --> 36:03.020]  And then everyone who went up and got one
[36:03.020 --> 36:07.480]  spent so long telling the bartenders about the evil cat
[36:08.000 --> 36:09.780]  and the bartenders did not care.
[36:10.680 --> 36:12.600]  We just kept going, no, no, no.
[36:12.660 --> 36:13.420]  You're not listening.
[36:13.780 --> 36:16.580]  This cat's so mean, it's crazy.
[36:16.760 --> 36:19.220]  And they're like, OK, thank you.
[36:19.380 --> 36:19.860]  Here it is.
[36:19.960 --> 36:22.760]  That's like international war stories about this cat.
[36:23.100 --> 36:23.500]  Like people.
[36:24.120 --> 36:25.960]  That cat tried to bite me the other day.
[36:26.120 --> 36:27.260]  Yep. Yep. Yep.
[36:27.380 --> 36:28.360]  Evil cat. He's hungry.
[36:28.940 --> 36:32.920]  Oh, God. Oh, how's your office filled with cat piss still or what's up?
[36:33.380 --> 36:36.100]  Oh, yeah. I think being out of the house
[36:36.740 --> 36:39.920]  sort of reset my nostrils and I came back here that it was it was potent.
[36:41.620 --> 36:43.780]  Based on how you previously talked about it,
[36:43.940 --> 36:46.680]  I felt like it was always potent, that it was never not potent.
[36:47.220 --> 36:48.800]  Well, I did start to get used to it, I think.
[36:49.320 --> 36:51.140]  Oh, no. Oh, God.
[36:51.300 --> 36:53.780]  But I locked I locked the door when he was when I was gone.
[36:53.840 --> 36:55.700]  So he was unable to use it again.
[36:56.240 --> 36:58.840]  But you just essentially bottled up the remaining piss.
[36:59.100 --> 37:02.280]  Yeah, was locking was locking the door crucial like.
[37:03.220 --> 37:04.520]  You had to lock it.
[37:05.020 --> 37:05.780]  Yeah, we talked about this.
[37:05.860 --> 37:07.700]  He can open doors, he opens handles.
[37:08.140 --> 37:11.080]  So I put the fingerprint lock on the on the bedroom one,
[37:11.080 --> 37:13.080]  but I didn't put one on my office.
[37:14.140 --> 37:16.620]  This cat's evil, is an evil cat.
[37:16.840 --> 37:18.380]  It's just an evil cat.
[37:18.680 --> 37:21.080]  Watching him figure out sliding doors was really impressive.
[37:21.300 --> 37:24.040]  Like a like an external sliding door.
[37:24.040 --> 37:27.760]  He just wedges his nose in the gap and then wiggles his head
[37:27.760 --> 37:30.800]  and slowly pushes these giant heavy doors apart.
[37:30.960 --> 37:34.080]  It takes him like five minutes, but he can he can open them.
[37:34.160 --> 37:36.220]  Going to see it trying to like scan its paw.
[37:36.820 --> 37:38.180]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.100]  It's going to learn how to like reset and then like its paw will be the new
[37:42.100 --> 37:45.840]  fingerprint. I watched Geoff walk inside past the sliding glass doors,
[37:45.920 --> 37:48.120]  past the cat, and the cat didn't like that.
[37:48.140 --> 37:50.320]  So it took a bite at Geoff.
[37:50.440 --> 37:52.800]  But I don't know that there was actual intent.
[37:52.800 --> 37:55.580]  It was just like, why did you do that?
[37:55.660 --> 37:58.440]  Like it was really it was really weird.
[37:58.560 --> 38:01.760]  I don't think I've ever seen a cat bite at someone without trying to actually bite
[38:01.760 --> 38:02.860]  them. It was very strange.
[38:02.960 --> 38:04.520]  Just give me a warning shot.
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.620]  I just imagine trying to scan the paw and then the next day just has a finger.
[38:09.820 --> 38:12.940]  It has found a finger somewhere in between.
[38:13.580 --> 38:17.160]  We probably won't get to it, but we came up with a bunch of a bunch of good
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.920]  question prompts and stuff at the wedding for for different things for the website.
[38:21.920 --> 38:24.340]  What website? What for the podcast?
[38:24.660 --> 38:26.300]  Fuck it. Where did I get website from?
[38:26.540 --> 38:27.500]  What's wrong with you?
[38:28.260 --> 38:29.060]  GeoffSucks.com?
[38:30.140 --> 38:30.540]  Regulatrion?
[38:30.940 --> 38:32.460]  Do we want to talk about one of them?
[38:32.940 --> 38:34.180]  Do we want to talk about?
[38:36.840 --> 38:39.480]  I kind of want to, because I've been curious about it.
[38:39.620 --> 38:40.760]  Do you want to queue it up? Which one?
[38:40.940 --> 38:45.340]  Yeah. So we talked about a few different things, but one of the ones that we said
[38:45.340 --> 38:50.620]  was if the podcasts were to have like if one of us died.
[38:50.620 --> 38:55.080]  OK, which person dying
[38:55.080 --> 38:57.960]  would affect the podcast the least?
[38:58.440 --> 39:01.900]  Me. OK, so I said me.
[39:02.440 --> 39:03.680]  I said me. Uh-huh.
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.660]  I think we can all I think we can all agree that Nick is the most important
[39:11.660 --> 39:13.320]  person in the podcast. Yeah, it wouldn't exist.
[39:13.840 --> 39:15.420]  Nick's number one. Nick, you're safe.
[39:15.480 --> 39:16.160]  You get to live forever.
[39:17.700 --> 39:20.560]  My reasoning was Nick's important to make it work.
[39:21.660 --> 39:22.900]  Andrew's a freak.
[39:23.400 --> 39:26.080]  Well, calm down, glory hole boy.
[39:26.400 --> 39:28.500]  Relax. You're a crazy person.
[39:28.500 --> 39:31.060]  And it's it's a hell of a lot of good content.
[39:31.380 --> 39:32.840]  Geoff's kind of the the host.
[39:33.860 --> 39:35.700]  And Eric makes sure we all show up.
[39:36.020 --> 39:39.140]  I'm the least important member of the podcast.
[39:39.540 --> 39:40.560]  Allow me to counter that.
[39:42.720 --> 39:43.800]  Nick's off the table.
[39:44.060 --> 39:46.360]  Andrew's absolutely the
[39:46.360 --> 39:50.920]  uh, just bizarre heart of the podcast.
[39:51.080 --> 39:52.560]  Like he he fuels it.
[39:52.620 --> 39:53.500]  He's the engine, right?
[39:53.820 --> 39:55.800]  Eric has to manage it.
[39:56.380 --> 39:59.540]  Gavin, you and I are largely redundant, except you are younger
[39:59.540 --> 40:00.980]  and more successful than me.
[40:01.160 --> 40:03.400]  So if somebody's got to go, it's me.
[40:05.300 --> 40:06.980]  I will say I've seen Gavin.
[40:07.480 --> 40:10.460]  I've seen Gavin try to host things and it's not.
[40:11.180 --> 40:12.440]  I wasn't built for it.
[40:12.840 --> 40:15.740]  Yeah, it's not it's definitely not a thing he naturally enjoys doing.
[40:16.190 --> 40:17.320]  Well, yeah, I guess.
[40:17.400 --> 40:21.580]  OK, so we have so we have answers from myself, Gavin and Geoff.
[40:23.560 --> 40:25.260]  Nick and Andrew, what do you guys think?
[40:25.580 --> 40:27.980]  I'm taking out Nick and just ending the whole thing.
[40:30.380 --> 40:32.860]  Let's just let's just sink the whole ship.
[40:33.160 --> 40:35.580]  Let's just get rid of Nick and just end the whole series.
[40:36.380 --> 40:39.920]  What's crazy is that without Nick, we we all still make it.
[40:40.260 --> 40:42.320]  Nothing changes for us, but no one hears it.
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.800]  Craig is the only person that hears the podcast.
[40:52.780 --> 40:55.420]  Craig gets a 20 percent ownership stake.
[40:59.760 --> 41:02.000]  I don't know that I think that's the funniest thing.
[41:02.540 --> 41:03.440]  Nick, I love you.
[41:03.500 --> 41:06.240]  I'm going to kill you just because it's might as well go nuclear.
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.800]  If one of us is going to die.
[41:08.020 --> 41:09.300]  Yeah, that is a fucking amazing.
[41:09.440 --> 41:10.380]  You are the most immune.
[41:11.240 --> 41:14.680]  That was one of my favorite things about the original face, though,
[41:14.680 --> 41:17.900]  is that when when I was still doing a lot of the other stuff at Rooster Teeth,
[41:17.980 --> 41:22.020]  I was like, oh, I like I like face because I'm the least important part of it.
[41:22.020 --> 41:23.160]  It felt it felt nice.
[41:24.600 --> 41:27.080]  Little did you know, you weren't the least important part of it.
[41:27.140 --> 41:27.980]  Sorry, it was Nick.
[41:28.400 --> 41:34.600]  It was there's no there's something really funny about being in a room
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.100]  like imagine a room with a gun that has one bullet and we have to kill somebody
[41:39.100 --> 41:42.100]  and everybody agrees this one guy can't be killed
[41:42.100 --> 41:46.240]  and then somebody just shooting that person in the face is really funny.
[41:48.340 --> 41:50.860]  And are you following that up with an immunity bullet?
[41:51.540 --> 41:52.360]  Oh, yeah.
[41:52.880 --> 41:55.100]  Well, you shoot it straight in the sky, you know, that way.
[41:56.420 --> 42:00.820]  I declare me to fire the immunity bullet into the sky,
[42:00.920 --> 42:05.080]  then realize the gun has no other ammo because I misunderstood the purpose
[42:06.940 --> 42:08.000]  of my crime.
[42:08.820 --> 42:10.000]  Oh, man, it's so good.
[42:10.280 --> 42:11.480]  Oh, that's even more embarrassing.
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.000]  I thought that that I thought maybe that was the way that question was going to go,
[42:15.100 --> 42:15.760]  where it was going to be.
[42:15.820 --> 42:16.960]  Everyone going me, me, me, me.
[42:17.080 --> 42:18.940]  And then one person going, Nick, and then
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.600]  and the whole series.
[42:22.980 --> 42:24.100]  Yeah. What the hell?
[42:24.760 --> 42:26.440]  Oh, man. Oh, my God.
[42:26.620 --> 42:30.120]  I mean, I did say Andrew was the freak, but it was Eric that a few weeks ago
[42:30.120 --> 42:33.400]  suggested catching a swordfish backwards in your ass.
[42:33.620 --> 42:35.180]  Yeah. I mean, well, then you can sort of fight.
[42:35.320 --> 42:36.300]  Everyone's been on a run.
[42:36.420 --> 42:40.860]  I love the fucking the community on Reddit was like, technically, it'd be too big.
[42:42.400 --> 42:44.560]  Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.
[42:44.780 --> 42:47.220]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, guys.
[42:47.980 --> 42:50.160]  Yeah. Technically, I think you're correct.
[42:51.120 --> 42:55.560]  It's so it's probably won't actually try to do it now.
[42:55.860 --> 42:59.640]  Just not understanding what we're doing, but thinking that we're hypothesizing
[42:59.640 --> 43:03.680]  if this what what do you think
[43:04.120 --> 43:07.100]  may chance would happen if such a thing were to occur?
[43:07.480 --> 43:10.360]  I'm imagining John Locke with a fish
[43:10.360 --> 43:14.320]  halfway in his anus, just yelling, don't tell me what I can't do.
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.240]  Oh, Christ, you're saying this is impossible.
[43:22.660 --> 43:23.880]  Look at me.
[43:24.200 --> 43:27.460]  It's just a man with a swordfish in his ass.
[43:27.760 --> 43:29.880]  Has anyone ever fired a gun with their anus?
[43:31.540 --> 43:32.500]  Oh, yeah.
[43:32.800 --> 43:36.120]  Well, with their anus is tough, but like with your anus is tough.
[43:36.220 --> 43:37.260]  I just don't know how you do it.
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.840]  Do you like you like shove a string up there
[43:39.840 --> 43:42.840]  and then like hope that your clench can like pull a trigger?
[43:43.060 --> 43:44.000]  You know what I mean? Like tie it.
[43:44.480 --> 43:46.080]  I don't know. That's tough.
[43:46.600 --> 43:49.640]  If it's like a hair trigger, maybe if you could like clench your butt
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.460]  cheeks real hard, it could it could trigger it.
[43:51.520 --> 43:54.520]  You know, you just have to clench the whole gun, though.
[43:54.560 --> 43:56.880]  I don't know how you would localize the trigger.
[43:57.900 --> 43:59.900]  I guess you just have to try to shake hard enough.
[44:00.000 --> 44:01.440]  We should read up and see if it's ever been done.
[44:01.540 --> 44:04.640]  I bet I bet a lot of people have fired a gun with a wiener.
[44:05.400 --> 44:06.440]  Oh, that's what I'm
[44:07.740 --> 44:09.240]  that's what I'm thinking of.
[44:09.240 --> 44:10.800]  Let me hear. Let me drop this image in the chat.
[44:11.040 --> 44:14.280]  My brain immediately went to imagine.
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.780]  No, not a literal, not a literal person using their dick to fire.
[44:19.020 --> 44:21.180]  Oh, I posted a dick in the chat.
[44:21.240 --> 44:23.960]  I'm posting Tom Savini's weapon.
[44:24.120 --> 44:25.160]  And from dusk till dawn.
[44:25.300 --> 44:29.600]  Oh, the idea of like somebody spreading their cheeks
[44:29.600 --> 44:32.720]  and that little barrel comes out of the asshole.
[44:33.400 --> 44:35.360]  Tom, Tom Savini's dead now, huh?
[44:35.360 --> 44:36.200]  He's been dead for a little bit.
[44:36.340 --> 44:37.240]  I don't think so.
[44:37.240 --> 44:39.620]  I think Tom Savini is very much alive.
[44:39.740 --> 44:41.500]  Well, I hope I didn't just let me see.
[44:42.500 --> 44:44.560]  I mean, he's definitely alive.
[44:44.900 --> 44:45.440]  He's 77.
[44:46.320 --> 44:48.480]  Thank God Tom Savini's still around.
[44:48.960 --> 44:51.460]  Oh, my God. He's one year older than Alice Cooper.
[44:52.880 --> 44:53.640]  Oh, man.
[44:53.660 --> 44:55.680]  He said he's been dead for a little bit.
[44:55.820 --> 44:58.600]  I remember reading that he died, but I guess he didn't.
[44:58.780 --> 44:59.400]  No, I get it.
[44:59.920 --> 45:00.540]  I have those.
[45:01.120 --> 45:02.940]  Yeah. You just get something wrong.
[45:03.520 --> 45:04.560]  Well, I just I don't remember.
[45:04.560 --> 45:07.740]  There's an actor that I constantly think is dead
[45:07.740 --> 45:10.240]  and I've been corrected like four different times.
[45:10.660 --> 45:12.200]  I don't remember who they are right now.
[45:12.260 --> 45:15.180]  So I'm sure I currently think they're dead and I'll be corrected again
[45:15.180 --> 45:16.080]  in the future.
[45:16.440 --> 45:18.440]  It's like another version of Guess Who Might Be Dead.
[45:20.400 --> 45:23.840]  Hey, we we should also mention, I don't know if we want to get into the results
[45:23.840 --> 45:26.660]  or save it for the video, but we did before we went out of town,
[45:27.260 --> 45:31.800]  filmed some supplemental content, including making potato toast,
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.640]  because last episode, 21, we discussed the mash, hash, cash, bash.
[45:36.040 --> 45:36.900]  What was it called?
[45:37.960 --> 45:40.080]  The mash, hash, cash, bash, bash.
[45:40.340 --> 45:42.980]  Open faced mash, hash, hash.
[45:43.180 --> 45:45.400]  OK, so you remember he doesn't know either.
[45:45.660 --> 45:48.540]  No, no, it is the open faced mash, hash, cash.
[45:48.600 --> 45:48.920]  You're right.
[45:49.700 --> 45:54.080]  So anyway, so we did actually get into the lab and create potato
[45:54.080 --> 45:55.220]  toast and filmed a video.
[45:55.320 --> 45:56.260]  I'm very excited to come out.
[45:56.820 --> 45:58.020]  I'm very excited to see it.
[45:58.600 --> 46:01.200]  What it really did is just remind me that we've really got to get out
[46:01.200 --> 46:02.700]  the previous batch of supplemental.
[46:03.080 --> 46:04.240]  There's so much. Yeah.
[46:04.560 --> 46:06.080]  Video supplemental to come out.
[46:06.400 --> 46:07.200]  Audio supplemental.
[46:07.900 --> 46:08.580]  We've got a lot.
[46:08.840 --> 46:09.760]  I'll get working on that.
[46:10.280 --> 46:11.620]  Man, I'm behind on stuff.
[46:11.820 --> 46:14.140]  Yeah, it's like you've been in the middle of stuff
[46:14.140 --> 46:17.520]  and had other things on your mind for like the last few months, man.
[46:17.860 --> 46:20.020]  That's been so much from like, I do after the wedding.
[46:20.280 --> 46:21.500]  Oh, yes, that's now.
[46:22.140 --> 46:23.380]  I've got all this stuff now.
[46:23.940 --> 46:26.020]  So when I was, you know, I was thinking, I'm sorry.
[46:26.080 --> 46:27.660]  I didn't mean to interrupt you, Andrew. Go ahead.
[46:27.700 --> 46:30.280]  No, it's just to tie onto that very quickly.
[46:30.280 --> 46:33.280]  Just a quick note, and I don't blame you at all, Gavin.
[46:33.680 --> 46:36.620]  But it's very funny where, you know, it's been obvious
[46:36.620 --> 46:38.900]  like we've known that you're going to be gone for a while.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.080]  And so I wanted to make sure that we had some Halloween content
[46:43.820 --> 46:47.060]  ready to go just to make sure it's in the can.
[46:47.400 --> 46:50.920]  And so we recorded a bunch of Halloween, three different
[46:50.920 --> 46:54.460]  Halloween based Let's Plays that I figured could be edited
[46:54.460 --> 46:57.560]  while everybody is away and then we can start releasing them
[46:57.560 --> 46:58.720]  as soon as October starts.
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.360]  And I got a note while Gavin was at his wedding overseas
[47:04.960 --> 47:10.200]  that Gavin had not uploaded his footage or audio for any of the three.
[47:10.960 --> 47:11.920]  Complete miss.
[47:13.360 --> 47:14.080]  All three.
[47:14.460 --> 47:16.400]  We got to we got to get ahead of all this stuff.
[47:17.020 --> 47:18.840]  Got to get it all done before I leave town.
[47:18.980 --> 47:22.660]  And then I just basically had the exact same effect as if I never showed up.
[47:22.740 --> 47:26.580]  Exactly. But no, actually worse because you were part of all of it.
[47:26.580 --> 47:27.720]  So we couldn't.
[47:27.800 --> 47:30.380]  It was just pending, which was so funny.
[47:30.840 --> 47:32.580]  Yeah, if you'd never showed up, we could have pivoted
[47:32.580 --> 47:35.900]  and still figuring out something that could have been releasable. Yeah.
[47:37.880 --> 47:38.920]  Oh, it's so good.
[47:39.120 --> 47:40.860]  You sent me that Slyke, I was like, ooh.
[47:41.540 --> 47:44.040]  All of them. All three of them.
[47:44.140 --> 47:46.080]  Can't do anything about that for a while.
[47:46.380 --> 47:47.080]  It's real funny.
[47:50.380 --> 47:53.420]  Hopefully now that now that all that this is done,
[47:53.640 --> 47:55.880]  I can get out of my dumb era because
[47:56.580 --> 47:58.980]  it's pretty detrimental to my productivity.
[47:59.220 --> 47:59.860]  Is this a screenshot?
[48:03.220 --> 48:06.040]  It's Nick being like, yeah, you've been on a run.
[48:06.880 --> 48:08.500]  That one's even worse.
[48:08.760 --> 48:10.760]  Fuck. That one is a.
[48:12.720 --> 48:14.320]  I didn't record it.
[48:16.420 --> 48:18.320]  Oh, the horror movie auction.
[48:18.940 --> 48:20.260]  I don't have anything for that one.
[48:20.940 --> 48:21.680]  Oh, that's funny.
[48:21.860 --> 48:24.700]  I either deleted it or I'd never press record.
[48:27.340 --> 48:30.500]  It's so, so hard being this dumb.
[48:30.600 --> 48:34.040]  So when you do the sink, why do you think it is that we sink?
[48:41.560 --> 48:46.620]  It was he said that recently,
[48:46.620 --> 48:48.620]  and it just is so fucking funny.
[48:49.280 --> 48:52.480]  We did a let's play in a game where it was very clear what platform
[48:52.480 --> 48:55.560]  we're playing on and Gavin bought it on a different platform anyway.
[48:55.720 --> 48:58.260]  And just realizing what he had done,
[48:58.260 --> 48:59.680]  just the exasperated.
[48:59.900 --> 49:04.160]  It is so every day I wake up like this and it's not great.
[49:09.860 --> 49:11.580]  The human body needs it.
[49:11.640 --> 49:12.840]  He's rest and sleep.
[49:13.760 --> 49:16.100]  It's been it's been a rough year for everybody.
[49:16.100 --> 49:18.740]  And you have had a lot on your plate getting ready.
[49:18.820 --> 49:22.380]  I remember what it was like the months leading up to my wedding, and I wasn't
[49:23.500 --> 49:25.200]  needing to keep it secret and stuff, too.
[49:25.500 --> 49:27.960]  It's a lot to weigh on you now that that's
[49:27.960 --> 49:30.340]  you're past that, buddy, you're going to get smart again.
[49:30.460 --> 49:32.340]  You will. We'll see. I hope so.
[49:32.860 --> 49:34.220]  Did you upload that stuff yet?
[49:34.920 --> 49:36.640]  Those let's play. Thanks.
[49:38.300 --> 49:42.420]  Uh, if you can get on that when we're done, that'd be great.
[49:43.700 --> 49:45.760]  We'd like him to come out for next October.
[49:46.620 --> 49:48.540]  Put the old links in. I'll get those up.
[49:48.760 --> 49:51.180]  OK, so on it.
[49:52.100 --> 49:55.280]  That's that's if I've recorded
[49:55.280 --> 50:01.800]  it. But the reason I'm asking Nick for, did we do it before or after is that I had
[50:02.460 --> 50:05.000]  I had the Halloween candy and the video after it.
[50:05.300 --> 50:08.960]  Yeah. So when he said after, I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, no.
[50:09.980 --> 50:11.220]  You want to check right now?
[50:11.960 --> 50:13.000]  What am I? What am I looking for?
[50:13.180 --> 50:14.140]  Left 4 Dead 2.
[50:14.620 --> 50:15.560]  Left 4 Dead 2.
[50:16.060 --> 50:18.360]  Audacity? Two videos, right?
[50:19.020 --> 50:20.240]  Two videos, two audio.
[50:20.880 --> 50:22.440]  Yeah. Left 4 Dead part one and part two.
[50:22.580 --> 50:23.480]  Oh, why is part one?
[50:23.920 --> 50:25.640]  Why is part one after part two?
[50:26.440 --> 50:28.400]  Well, no, that's probably fine.
[50:28.520 --> 50:29.140]  What was the other one?
[50:30.500 --> 50:31.540]  Outlast Trials.
[50:32.080 --> 50:32.620]  I got all that.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.020]  That's probably fine is what you're going with.
[50:37.300 --> 50:38.640]  That's probably that's good enough.
[50:38.740 --> 50:39.860]  Maybe for now.
[50:40.100 --> 50:40.900]  He's got both.
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.520]  I've got both in their different sizes.
[50:43.900 --> 50:46.100]  I just did. I say one before the other.
[50:46.140 --> 50:47.000]  How would I have done that?
[50:47.920 --> 50:49.040]  Yeah, that's what you did.
[50:50.060 --> 50:51.100]  Oh, yeah.
[50:51.860 --> 50:53.560]  Introducing our new supplemental series.
[50:53.700 --> 50:54.800]  How would I have done that?
[50:56.520 --> 50:59.560]  Can we try to reverse engineer our stupidity?
[51:01.880 --> 51:04.540]  Reverse engineered stupidity is a great title for an episode.
[51:05.260 --> 51:05.940]  Oh, yeah.
[51:06.380 --> 51:10.360]  We recorded a supplemental, Gavin, while you were away that
[51:10.360 --> 51:12.980]  you were going to be part of, but you didn't.
[51:13.420 --> 51:14.260]  Well, you're busy.
[51:14.560 --> 51:16.120]  I sent you a thing to submit for it.
[51:16.440 --> 51:19.380]  I'm so excited to see you take part in that because I feel like
[51:19.380 --> 51:21.240]  you are going to really struggle.
[51:21.580 --> 51:26.020]  It is a game of deception where you're trying to figure out who is
[51:26.640 --> 51:30.200]  both you as a player and you as an evaluator,
[51:30.220 --> 51:32.400]  I think is going to be so fucking funny.
[51:33.920 --> 51:39.060]  It's we did it with Nick and then Eric and Geoff were the deceiver role people.
[51:39.340 --> 51:42.920]  And how it works is I will say an opinion that is like,
[51:43.460 --> 51:45.340]  I'll ask a question like, what is a movie you hate?
[51:45.380 --> 51:47.340]  And one of them was Napoleon Dynamite.
[51:47.860 --> 51:49.320]  And then so I'll state that.
[51:49.820 --> 51:53.460]  And then Nick has to listen to Eric and Geoff, try to convince him
[51:53.460 --> 51:58.540]  that that is what they submitted, or it could be something that you or I submitted.
[51:58.840 --> 52:01.480]  It's either an opinion they have or neither of them have it.
[52:01.500 --> 52:03.500]  And they're trying to convince them of it.
[52:03.700 --> 52:05.140]  Oh, and if I'm screwed.
[52:05.520 --> 52:07.280]  Oh, it's going to be so good. I can't wait.
[52:07.580 --> 52:08.880]  There was one flip.
[52:08.920 --> 52:11.480]  And if this is too much information, feel free to cut it out or bleep it.
[52:11.520 --> 52:12.620]  But there was one flip in it.
[52:12.620 --> 52:14.360]  And we'll use Napoleon Dynamite as an example.
[52:14.360 --> 52:17.380]  But this isn't the example in the episode where.
[52:18.960 --> 52:24.980]  Andrew goes, OK, favorite movie, Napoleon Dynamite, Eric and Geoff go.
[52:25.140 --> 52:29.020]  And we had to both tell Nick why it was our favorite movie, right,
[52:29.040 --> 52:30.020]  and why we wrote that down.
[52:30.320 --> 52:32.220]  And then as soon as we get done and he makes his choice,
[52:32.960 --> 52:36.540]  Andrew goes, OK, least favorite movie, Napoleon Dynamite.
[52:38.520 --> 52:43.300]  Two separate people submitted the same title for favorite
[52:43.300 --> 52:44.920]  and it was perfect.
[52:45.480 --> 52:48.960]  Oh, my God, dude, it was it was it was something.
[52:49.420 --> 52:50.480]  When does that come out?
[52:51.020 --> 52:52.460]  I've no idea. We've got so much.
[52:52.640 --> 52:55.580]  Nick is saying it's out by the time this episode's out.
[52:55.580 --> 52:58.260]  This Sunday. Yeah. Or this. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it is out.
[52:58.360 --> 53:00.720]  Yeah, we did a poll and it won. Yeah. Yeah. It's very.
[53:00.860 --> 53:03.540]  It was it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun.
[53:03.580 --> 53:05.420]  I'm excited to see Gavin do it. Same.
[53:06.020 --> 53:09.480]  Yeah. Hey, speaking of fun and things that we've done recently,
[53:09.480 --> 53:12.800]  we had this whole discussion two episodes ago.
[53:12.800 --> 53:17.180]  Now about the the mythical $50,000 bonus that doesn't exist,
[53:17.280 --> 53:20.060]  that won't ever exist and how to get a hot dog. Yeah. Yeah.
[53:20.620 --> 53:23.600]  And that got me thinking we should just film that, right?
[53:23.600 --> 53:26.880]  Like we should all make hot dog gloves and try to play catch together and see how
[53:28.240 --> 53:31.860]  fully dressed hot dogs and see how messy we get and just try to have a game
[53:31.860 --> 53:34.220]  of catch with a bunch of hot dog gloves and baseballs.
[53:34.240 --> 53:35.560]  Like, why wouldn't we do that?
[53:35.900 --> 53:37.060]  How do you make the hot dog?
[53:38.040 --> 53:42.120]  You make a hot dog and then you, you know, make a take a hot dog bun.
[53:42.120 --> 53:43.940]  You put a hot dog in it. You put whatever you would put.
[53:44.020 --> 53:48.880]  I like onions and some ketchup and mustard and probably some some relish on it.
[53:48.920 --> 53:49.800]  And I put that in my hand.
[53:49.900 --> 53:53.720]  And then Eric throws a baseball at my face and I try to catch it with that hand.
[53:53.840 --> 53:57.200]  You're hearing hot dog glove as if it is a thing that we must create
[53:57.200 --> 53:58.560]  that is a glove in some way.
[53:58.780 --> 54:00.380]  Oh, like a physical. Yeah, sorry.
[54:00.620 --> 54:02.600]  Yeah. And if you if you think back a couple episodes,
[54:02.600 --> 54:05.820]  it just was catch ball with hot dogs. Yes.
[54:06.120 --> 54:06.740]  Catch a ball with.
[54:07.020 --> 54:08.900]  I just assume like with the hot dog in your hand,
[54:08.980 --> 54:10.580]  but it's essentially becomes a glove, right?
[54:10.580 --> 54:12.340]  Sure. Totally.
[54:12.400 --> 54:17.480]  I was just trying to imagine like how like are you slicing the hot dog and hat?
[54:17.560 --> 54:19.600]  Like, how are you bridging to make a glove?
[54:19.780 --> 54:21.500]  I was not thinking like singular dog.
[54:21.920 --> 54:25.380]  Oh, yeah, I didn't mean to confuse you with the glove word with the G word.
[54:25.640 --> 54:30.500]  I just want to catch a play a game of catch with the just fucking shitty
[54:30.500 --> 54:34.980]  covered in hot dog juice and fucking mustard and ketchup baseball.
[54:35.740 --> 54:38.180]  So should we all stand in front of the pitching machine
[54:38.180 --> 54:40.840]  and see how we get on with our crafted hot dogs?
[54:41.460 --> 54:43.680]  Yes. That's a good idea.
[54:44.040 --> 54:45.660]  OK, we'll have one attempt to that.
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.680]  It'll be just a bush.
[54:48.380 --> 54:52.380]  Do you think you could bind a hot dog to a bun with just cheese
[54:52.960 --> 54:54.380]  or would it be too heavy?
[54:54.900 --> 54:55.480]  You could try.
[54:55.760 --> 54:58.640]  I'm trying to think of like if you wanted to do like a real glove,
[54:58.720 --> 55:03.500]  if you put a hot dog bun on each finger like Freddy Krueger
[55:03.500 --> 55:07.840]  and then opened them up
[55:08.180 --> 55:09.460]  but then you need a dog.
[55:09.620 --> 55:13.420]  So I was trying to think of what you could bind a hot dog to a bun to.
[55:14.080 --> 55:18.120]  Cheese is, I think, the best option of all the hot dog things.
[55:18.420 --> 55:21.160]  Sew it all together if you wanted to get like real about it.
[55:21.220 --> 55:22.120]  Well, that's not edible there.
[55:22.240 --> 55:23.900]  Then yeah, then I feel like that's.
[55:24.200 --> 55:25.480]  Unless you sew it with cheese strings.
[55:25.780 --> 55:26.520]  Still got to be edible.
[55:26.980 --> 55:28.600]  Oh, that was interesting.
[55:28.960 --> 55:29.580]  Cheese string.
[55:30.660 --> 55:34.060]  Like a cheddar Rambo just like tying together.
[55:34.540 --> 55:36.520]  You sew it together with nerds ropes.
[55:38.120 --> 55:38.600]  Twizzlers.
[55:38.880 --> 55:39.700]  Cheddar stitch.
[55:44.040 --> 55:46.680]  Anyway, I thought that'd be something disgusting we could do.
[55:48.120 --> 55:50.260]  Can you imagine cheese stitches?
[55:51.640 --> 55:52.460]  Sounds good.
[55:52.760 --> 55:57.800]  Oh, getting like shot in a movie using a cheese string, try to patch it up.
[55:58.620 --> 56:01.900]  If there was just a hot dog dog like the Frankfurt,
[56:02.100 --> 56:05.060]  but it was stitched up and down with cheese, I think that'd be really good.
[56:05.060 --> 56:05.860]  Oh, yeah.
[56:06.860 --> 56:10.140]  Oh, well, I mean, they do ones with cheese in the middle.
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.340]  Not stitch, but just like they got cheese on the inside.
[56:13.820 --> 56:15.660]  You said buns that have cheese on the inside?
[56:15.840 --> 56:17.000]  No, he said dogs.
[56:17.060 --> 56:17.960]  He's talking about dogs.
[56:18.100 --> 56:18.840]  Dogs. Yeah, yeah.
[56:18.840 --> 56:20.980]  No, that's that's my preferred dog, actually.
[56:21.840 --> 56:22.820]  Cheese filled dog. Hell yeah.
[56:23.220 --> 56:24.580]  Would you have more than one of those, Gavin?
[56:26.180 --> 56:27.220]  I think so.
[56:27.800 --> 56:29.880]  Look, I'm just the dollar hot dog wasn't for me.
[56:30.380 --> 56:31.900]  I've got to go more premium.
[56:32.460 --> 56:35.540]  I had a hot dog in England that was very mediocre, by the way.
[56:35.940 --> 56:40.060]  I have a question about hot dogs that I'd like all of your opinions on.
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.340]  I have a weird situation that I had never thought about with the hot dog count.
[56:45.700 --> 56:46.960]  I had a hot dog.
[56:47.420 --> 56:50.600]  I ate about 85% of it,
[56:50.660 --> 56:54.260]  and then it tasted weird from the first bite, but I kept going
[56:54.260 --> 56:59.240]  and it made me sick and I didn't know, does that count as a hot?
[56:59.760 --> 57:01.100]  Can I put that on the count or not?
[57:01.740 --> 57:04.180]  I think so. We talked about this, right?
[57:04.580 --> 57:08.560]  Yeah. We had a conversation at at baseball or at like dollar hot dog night
[57:08.560 --> 57:11.940]  where I think my wife was getting into it with Gavin about like,
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.100]  I see how much of the hot dog counts is one like, you know, one eaten hot dog.
[57:17.200 --> 57:19.640]  And Gavin went 51% and she went.
[57:20.040 --> 57:23.680]  How could you tell what 51% of a hot?
[57:23.780 --> 57:26.040]  Like, what are you talking about?
[57:26.860 --> 57:31.940]  Then I wanted to cut a hot dog into 51 and 49 percent halves.
[57:32.680 --> 57:37.340]  And I said, she hates talking to me.
[57:41.400 --> 57:46.100]  I think I think she and I are very similar where it's just the immediacy
[57:46.100 --> 57:49.160]  of what the fuck are you talking about?
[57:49.280 --> 57:51.520]  I think there's just a very low tolerance for it.
[57:51.920 --> 57:55.640]  I also said it's against the spirit
[57:55.640 --> 57:58.480]  of the competition to go like 51% a hot dog.
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.240]  So I think if you got to like, you know, 80, 85 percent, it made you sick.
[58:03.420 --> 58:05.820]  You know, like you made an effort to eat this dog.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.380]  A hundred percent. OK, well, then I'll update my count.
[58:08.600 --> 58:10.860]  I feel like the number we all kind of settled on.
[58:10.960 --> 58:14.220]  And I might be remembering this wrong because I am in my dumb era, too.
[58:14.240 --> 58:16.320]  And I have remembered a lot of stuff wrong in the last couple of months.
[58:17.520 --> 58:18.180]  Embarrassingly so.
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.460]  But I feel like we came to around the like 75 percent range
[58:22.460 --> 58:23.300]  was what we felt like.
[58:23.300 --> 58:26.920]  If you can put down like three quarters of a hot dog, that should count.
[58:27.080 --> 58:29.460]  But I think it only counts for the final dog.
[58:29.620 --> 58:31.180]  But you can't just see a bunch of 75.
[58:31.220 --> 58:35.380]  I was about to say the same thing, because what was going to happen
[58:35.380 --> 58:36.680]  if we didn't say that right now?
[58:37.040 --> 58:38.740]  It was just going to be people posting going like,
[58:39.060 --> 58:40.440]  did I eat all that? Look at this.
[58:40.520 --> 58:42.560]  I eat these dogs and then here's a bunch of twenty five percent.
[58:42.760 --> 58:44.220]  And it's like, no, it has to be like your last one.
[58:44.260 --> 58:46.500]  You can't just keep eating three quarter dogs.
[58:46.520 --> 58:49.340]  Like there's a spirit to this whole thing, guys.
[58:49.500 --> 58:50.580]  Like it's also it's not a race.
[58:50.580 --> 58:53.720]  It's not a race. It's not a competition, not a competition, not a competition.
[58:54.380 --> 58:56.300]  Kicking your fucking asses, though.
[58:59.680 --> 59:02.380]  Number 18, 18 hot dogs, baby,
[59:02.880 --> 59:05.540]  including one very mediocre British hot dog.
[59:05.720 --> 59:08.460]  Wait, Andrew, so were you waiting for a ruling on this?
[59:08.460 --> 59:09.820]  You just add it to your hot dog.
[59:09.960 --> 59:12.340]  Yeah, yeah, I've been right now on Slack.
[59:12.420 --> 59:13.340]  Your number just went up.
[59:13.680 --> 59:15.900]  Yeah, I've just been waiting.
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.300]  I didn't want to submit it until I got an approval from everybody else.
[59:19.300 --> 59:22.660]  Nice. And it was you said it wasn't good and it made you throw up.
[59:22.780 --> 59:24.380]  Yeah, it was terrible. Yeah, it was bad.
[59:24.460 --> 59:26.140]  You actually hurled or you just felt a bit funny?
[59:26.300 --> 59:27.800]  No, I like it.
[59:27.900 --> 59:29.760]  It messed up my stomach. It was not great.
[59:30.660 --> 59:33.840]  It was one of those things where you take one bite and it's like this something
[59:34.760 --> 59:36.140]  something ain't right about this.
[59:36.240 --> 59:38.820]  I don't know what went wrong with this, but this is not good.
[59:39.600 --> 59:41.260]  And I kept I kept trucking through.
[59:41.660 --> 59:43.180]  Was it one that you made or you bought?
[59:43.300 --> 59:44.440]  Bought. OK.
[59:44.840 --> 59:45.760]  It was a bought dog.
[59:46.400 --> 59:50.820]  Is your dog toaster in in rotation now that the dog contest is happening?
[59:50.960 --> 59:53.320]  No, it's not. It hasn't left the closet.
[59:53.640 --> 59:55.460]  That's insane. I don't know where it is.
[59:55.940 --> 59:59.060]  And the fact that you've got one of those and you're not using it in the dog era
[59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.820]  is pretty nuts.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.840]  Did you just say it hasn't left?
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.720]  Did you just say it hasn't left the closet and then immediately follow up with
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.580]  I don't know where it is?
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:08.880]  Well, it's it's somewhere.
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.640]  There's a lot of stuff in the closet that I have.
[01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:12.920]  So it's it's somewhere in there.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.740]  Can you imagine that as a supplemental?
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.320]  You got a whole bag.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.380]  You've got a giant bag of sauce, a McDonald's BTS sauce in there.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.820]  Probably like 40 pounds of pancake mix.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.080]  It's 50 inch TV from 2009.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:37.940]  That's a bag of fire extinguisher goo.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.900]  Yeah. Oh, no, I think I got rid of that.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:41.980]  I think that's gone.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.540]  Pretty sure that's too much.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.520]  I hope that's gone.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:45.860]  I'm just looking in.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.220]  I got a giant Hulk thing.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.540]  It's it's it's a lot.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.040]  I don't use it. It's filled.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.040]  Have have you guys seen the movie Monkey Man?
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.880]  No, not yet. Yeah.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.740]  I didn't. I kind of wanted to see it because it looked good,
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.240]  but I thought the name was kind of silly.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.880]  But I watched it on the plane.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.260]  Just highly recommend it.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.000]  That's all very fucking good, though.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.480]  It's about 75% shooting and punching.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.080]  Yeah, it's a pretty action paced all the way through.
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:14.280]  That guy, Dev Patel is awesome.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.180]  So I think he got pretty messed up making it.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:16.840]  Didn't he got hurt?
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.840]  I mean, he got stabbed a lot in the movie.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.200]  I'll say that it's a violent, violent film.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.540]  Great. Great for a great for a plane ride.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.620]  Yeah. I watched Bad Boys 2, then Bad Boys 1, then Bad Boys Ride or Die.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.040]  Is that your preferred order?
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.660]  Yeah, I think not watching Bad Boys for life.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.100]  Like there was like that third one that I forgot that they made or whatever.
[01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:41.400]  Uh, like not watching that one, I think did me OK.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.440]  Insane that they took that name on a movie that wasn't the fourth one.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:46.980]  Yeah. Mm hmm.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.820]  Wait, so Eric, you saw the most recent Bad Boys?
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.980]  I did. Yeah.
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.860]  Dude, Reggie, Reggie.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.060]  Dude, Reggie is like... Reggie.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:55.960]  He's the little movie.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.180]  Here's the thing.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.160]  I think we might need to draft greatest ancillary characters of all time.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.580]  And Reggie might be number one.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.180]  That's what I said.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.940]  He has three films, two, three and four of Bad Boys.
[01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:10.740]  And it is maybe the greatest cinematic arc in film history.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:13.580]  Absolutely. Absolutely. It's so cool.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:17.980]  I also watched that movie on the plane and I felt bad for talking shit about it,
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.200]  having not seen it because I quite enjoyed it for the most part.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:21.600]  I really liked it.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.960]  And Reggie was fucking amazing.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.900]  And it ended on Reggie.
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:26.560]  Like that was just awesome.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.780]  That's the next Bad Boys 5 life.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.560]  And it's fucking Reggie, baby.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.780]  What is a spoiler? What's the spoiler there?
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.340]  It just ended on the character.
[01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.600]  I didn't say what he was doing.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.720]  Wait, wait, you said, you said, how is it a spoiler that described how the film ended?
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:44.960]  It ended on Reggie.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.520]  What is that? What's the spoiler there?
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.120]  Would it be a spoiler if I said it ended?
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:50.380]  Oh, OK, did you?
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.740]  Does anybody really think Reggie's going to fucking die in the film?
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:54.580]  It could have happened.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.700]  No way.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.480]  It ended on Will Smith.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.700]  Oh, no, he didn't die.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:00.280]  Nobody thought he was going to die.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.980]  Didn't he almost die in the last one?
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:04.460]  Yeah.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.660]  Yeah, I guess he did.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.180]  That was the whole point of three, wasn't it?
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.380]  Yeah, I think I think there's something wrong with Martin Lawrence.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:15.580]  I think whatever they filmed like was like the last stuff at like the end of the movie.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.720]  I think there's something wrong with him.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.160]  I can see a difference.
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.440]  You can tell when they did reshoots.
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.980]  Also, he just he looked real tired.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:21.720]  He looked real tired.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.220]  Yeah, he was.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.300]  I think it's his best Bad Boys.
[01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.840]  I think what they do with the Martin Lawrence character in that film, I really enjoyed.
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:29.580]  It's fun.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:30.760]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.540]  We we we do need to start wrapping this episode up, though.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.040]  We do. We got to get to like the end here.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.400]  Sorry. I'm sorry.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:38.500]  Bad Boys movie now.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.180]  You should.
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.080]  Does anyone want to watch it with me?
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.680]  I'll watch. I'll watch Bad Boys with you, dude.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.460]  Let's do it.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.560]  Yeah, can't be this weekend.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.140]  I have to go to another wedding on a different coast.
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.060]  But hey, Eric, you lost it.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:51.760]  How's your mouth?
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.460]  Lost a temporary crown.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:56.220]  Coming back from London.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:57.820]  Got here. Got a permanent crown on.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:58.960]  Lost the permanent crown.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.100]  Went back, got another permanent crown on baby.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.220]  And that was right before this podcast started.
[01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:06.860]  So did they just they just put the the one they made back on?
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.960]  They just clean the area and the dentist went, I don't know what happened.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.380]  I'm sorry.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.260]  I don't know why this didn't take and then started cleaning the area
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.740]  and everything and then went, oh, I think it's because you produce
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.280]  you have very strong saliva glands in your mouth.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.940]  So I just went, what?
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.960]  And he's like, no, no, it's good.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.300]  You want that? And I said, OK.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:34.000]  What are you like, a H.R. Giger alien?
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:38.500]  Yeah, I've got I've got a Giger alien mouth, kind of.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.560]  So there you go.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.980]  You got one of those Jurassic Park spitter mouths that yeah, Newman.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.220]  Yeah, well, I'm constantly spitting at Wayne Knight.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.200]  So, yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.160]  Do you have good distance on your spits?
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.740]  They're they're OK.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:55.580]  Sometimes it depends on what I'm doing.
[01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.600]  I tried to learn at a young age how to do like a baseball spit,
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.360]  like, you know, like when they have like a big, like tight.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.340]  Yeah. You know, like a like that, like, yeah, it goes.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.340]  You know that. Yeah.
[01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.120]  But you got to be like really salivate up.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.280]  And, you know, I get there.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.040]  I get that. I went head to head against Geoff once and I lost.
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.940]  That didn't surprise me at all.
[01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:21.120]  And I had and that was an I spit beyond my means that day.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.540]  I would never be able to do that again.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.920]  It was just one in a million.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:27.460]  It was a one in a million day.
[01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.960]  It was just one of those days where you make up,
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.340]  you wake up and for like three minutes, you're Mickey Mantle, you know,
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.020]  and then it goes away.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.760]  I just can't keep my my gobs together.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:39.200]  It always just goes in a spray and I lose velocity.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.000]  Tragic.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.460]  Man, that's worse than I thought.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.120]  Jesus Christ.
[01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.720]  Yeah, I thought it was a vile bummer.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.860]  Jesus Christ, I'm going to sleep tonight, man.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.200]  Oh, Christ.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.680]  All right. Jesus Christ.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.160]  Yeah. All right.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:12.500]  Well, there you go.
