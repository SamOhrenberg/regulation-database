[00:00.000 --> 00:04.120]  This is a regulation announcement. I repeat, a regulation announcement.
[00:04.480 --> 00:08.060]  We have news. Regulation news. Are you ready?
[00:08.660 --> 00:12.060]  Andrew. Yes, I'm ready. Hit us with the news.
[00:12.500 --> 00:15.540]  We have a store. What kind of store?
[00:15.960 --> 00:19.020]  It's a merch store. It's where we sell merch at the merch store.
[00:19.460 --> 00:23.000]  What? Where? Who? It's on Store Street. It's on Store Street.
[00:23.260 --> 00:26.100]  Yeah. It's on the internet.
[00:27.340 --> 00:28.720]  Regulationsstore.com. Where else would it be?
[00:29.280 --> 00:35.500]  It's where you go to buy things related to the regulation podcast, such as one shirt.
[00:35.600 --> 00:41.420]  We have one shirt for sale right now. You can buy a regulation shirt. That's all you can buy.
[00:41.500 --> 00:43.600]  You can buy as many of them as you want. But it's the regulation shirt.
[00:43.600 --> 00:45.080]  But it is the regulation shirt. It's the only shirt you need.
[00:45.420 --> 00:47.020]  That means you can go to the store and be like,
[00:47.060 --> 00:49.140]  I'll take everything and it's not too expensive.
[00:49.500 --> 00:52.200]  No, it's really easy. It's actually pretty good.
[00:52.380 --> 00:55.760]  That's actually really good. I'll take one of everything.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.560]  And if you want to go in and buy a shirt right now, that would be cool because it would help us
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.900]  stress test the store. Because coming not too far off in the distant future,
[01:11.060 --> 01:13.120]  assuming this store works... Andrew?
[01:13.720 --> 01:13.940]  What?
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.100]  Hit it with the drum roll.
[01:16.280 --> 01:18.040]  Now, Gavin, you do the announcement.
[01:18.820 --> 01:25.180]  Oh my god, after the shirt, guess what? The first ever official regulation gerpler.
[01:25.180 --> 01:26.620]  Will it break the store?
[01:27.340 --> 01:30.520]  And now, Nick, you hit him with the oohs and the aahs.
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.880]  It's like doing 100% eat.
[01:34.200 --> 01:36.600]  Then Eric, you hit him with the domain name again.
[01:36.920 --> 01:43.760]  You go to regulationstore.com to grab that shirt. And then on Friday, November 22nd,
[01:44.040 --> 01:51.600]  it will be GERP Friday. That will be the launch of the gerpler. But for now, go to regulationstore.com,
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.600]  grab a shirt, support us directly, and help us find out if this store launch can work for us or not.
[01:57.920 --> 01:59.740]  Do you want to hear some fun facts about the URL?
[02:00.220 --> 02:00.460]  Yeah.
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.820]  Regulation.store was taken. Regulation.shop was too expensive,
[02:06.120 --> 02:13.040]  so we got regulationstore.com. But guess what? We've also got regulationstore.store.
[02:15.680 --> 02:17.920]  It's true, I just went to a network.
[02:19.880 --> 02:22.840]  I've already redirected it to the main store.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.680]  This concludes your regulation announcement.
[02:30.320 --> 02:35.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[02:36.020 --> 02:41.500]  And with me, as always, Andrew Pan, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Bedore.
[02:42.020 --> 02:49.140]  This is episode 23, and Gavin has just sent a picture of his crotch. He has peed his pants.
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.860]  That happened maybe 16 seconds before we started.
[02:53.300 --> 02:54.980]  What happened?
[02:55.440 --> 02:56.860]  I spilled water on myself.
[02:57.420 --> 02:58.160]  Oh yeah, right.
[02:59.440 --> 03:01.080]  Well, it's not piss, because piss wouldn't...
[03:01.080 --> 03:03.020]  Oh, I guess piss would start there if my penis was...
[03:05.340 --> 03:08.120]  I'm not sure. Where else would it start, man?
[03:08.820 --> 03:11.780]  I always imagine piss starting right in the center of the crotch,
[03:11.800 --> 03:15.480]  but if your penis has any length, it may start down there.
[03:17.980 --> 03:20.220]  So are you the new piss boy, or what's going on?
[03:20.920 --> 03:21.800]  Taking after the cats?
[03:21.820 --> 03:23.460]  Well, it's not piss, though.
[03:25.100 --> 03:27.560]  I mean, I'm just having a look. Oh, you're doing it...
[03:27.560 --> 03:29.200]  Are you going shmi mode in your own office?
[03:29.880 --> 03:30.580]  Are you spraying?
[03:31.840 --> 03:32.820]  Oh, is it spray?
[03:33.180 --> 03:34.020]  Are you mad at you?
[03:34.380 --> 03:36.580]  Let me piss in one of the outlets.
[03:37.280 --> 03:39.320]  Do you feel like you've been gone too much recently,
[03:39.480 --> 03:40.700]  and so you're just punishing yourself?
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.020]  Oh man, I've got a soggy podcast ahead of me.
[03:46.220 --> 03:48.080]  Oh no, a sog pod.
[03:49.720 --> 03:51.380]  You know, I'll take piss boy for one episode.
[03:52.260 --> 03:54.360]  This will be my sog pod as piss boy.
[03:54.740 --> 03:58.040]  Yeah, you could be either soggy or Donald Duck.
[03:58.460 --> 03:59.200]  You have two options.
[03:59.380 --> 04:00.220]  Good way to put it.
[04:01.380 --> 04:05.360]  I like that you have a wet left pocket and a little bit of a wet,
[04:05.360 --> 04:09.400]  right, not pocket, but like front shorts on your knees.
[04:09.680 --> 04:13.420]  It's like you piss so hard on the left, it shot to the right.
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.520]  Like you fire hosed it.
[04:15.680 --> 04:16.900]  Like it launched from...
[04:16.900 --> 04:18.500]  Yeah, it's that wetness on the right.
[04:18.940 --> 04:20.340]  Yeah, isn't there a little bit?
[04:20.360 --> 04:21.340]  No, it's just...
[04:21.340 --> 04:22.240]  Oh, is it the pattern?
[04:22.760 --> 04:23.840]  Yeah, just piss.
[04:24.120 --> 04:24.740]  It's just...
[04:24.740 --> 04:25.620]  Never mind then.
[04:25.740 --> 04:27.140]  I thought you got both legs.
[04:28.220 --> 04:29.260]  How disappointing.
[04:29.880 --> 04:30.960]  How are you guys doing?
[04:31.380 --> 04:32.180]  We've had a good...
[04:32.740 --> 04:33.220]  Good.
[04:33.220 --> 04:36.280]  I have a fucking note and I was looking over my notes.
[04:36.600 --> 04:38.640]  We were coming from another recording right into this,
[04:38.700 --> 04:39.480]  so I didn't have time to prepare.
[04:40.260 --> 04:43.280]  And I have a note that I remember writing down yesterday.
[04:44.060 --> 04:46.320]  And do you have those notes where you don't feel like you need
[04:46.320 --> 04:48.720]  to explain it further because you'll remember?
[04:49.240 --> 04:49.460]  Yeah.
[04:50.060 --> 04:52.480]  I wrote down, I'm so dumb.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.580]  And I don't know what the fuck that means.
[04:55.800 --> 04:56.380]  All right.
[04:56.520 --> 04:59.460]  That could be written before every single note you've ever made.
[04:59.680 --> 04:59.880]  Yeah.
[04:59.880 --> 05:01.720]  I don't know what the...
[05:01.720 --> 05:05.340]  I must have done something so stupid yesterday that I thought
[05:05.340 --> 05:08.960]  writing down that alone was enough to remember it 24 hours later.
[05:09.900 --> 05:11.340]  That, in fact, was dumb.
[05:12.220 --> 05:13.480]  You didn't know it at the time,
[05:13.560 --> 05:16.700]  but your note was a reflection of the action you were currently doing.
[05:17.280 --> 05:18.560]  What could it be?
[05:19.560 --> 05:21.420]  Oh, what have you done recently that's...
[05:21.420 --> 05:22.320]  What did you do yesterday?
[05:22.660 --> 05:23.200]  ...a stupid potential?
[05:24.000 --> 05:24.580]  Piss your pants?
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.440]  No, the last time I did anything like that was when I shit my pants
[05:29.440 --> 05:30.140]  at Gavin's wedding.
[05:32.940 --> 05:35.820]  I've had dry undies since then.
[05:36.000 --> 05:36.920]  I went for a bike ride.
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.220]  I had a normal day yesterday, I think.
[05:39.660 --> 05:41.120]  Did you see someone in a car that was stupid?
[05:41.360 --> 05:42.220]  Did you rip a pump off?
[05:42.540 --> 05:43.620]  I didn't rip any pumps off.
[05:43.680 --> 05:48.840]  I did drive around town yesterday, but nothing funny happened.
[05:49.180 --> 05:51.700]  Did you get pushed over by a ghost or whatever?
[05:52.020 --> 05:53.680]  No, I don't remember any ghosts.
[05:54.180 --> 05:54.720]  I don't know.
[05:54.800 --> 05:56.080]  Maybe it'll come to me, but I...
[05:56.940 --> 05:58.820]  Anyway, that was my only note for today.
[05:58.820 --> 06:01.080]  Other than I saw three Dobermans.
[06:02.480 --> 06:04.040]  What time did you write the note?
[06:04.440 --> 06:05.380]  I wish it said...
[06:06.400 --> 06:09.880]  I wrote it before I wrote my most recent Doberman update,
[06:10.080 --> 06:11.040]  which would have been yesterday.
[06:12.120 --> 06:12.920]  I guess.
[06:13.260 --> 06:14.320]  Maybe it was day before yesterday?
[06:14.480 --> 06:14.960]  I don't know.
[06:15.760 --> 06:17.460]  Did you see some dogs that weren't Dobermans,
[06:17.520 --> 06:18.640]  but you thought they were Dobermans?
[06:18.720 --> 06:20.120]  And then you just went, classic Geoff.
[06:22.800 --> 06:24.520]  No, I don't think so.
[06:25.220 --> 06:28.740]  Well, I have an exciting thing to share that I don't think you guys know about.
[06:28.820 --> 06:31.780]  While you're pondering, this is insane.
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.040]  This is... I have so much cool stuff from the community this week
[06:35.040 --> 06:38.720]  that I'm so excited to get your guys' reaction on this.
[06:38.780 --> 06:39.680]  You especially, Geoff.
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.540]  Are you ready to have your mind blown?
[06:42.680 --> 06:43.080]  To be excited?
[06:43.280 --> 06:44.140]  Are you ready to react, Geoff?
[06:45.260 --> 06:47.420]  I had somebody, someone in our community,
[06:47.640 --> 06:51.320]  reached out to our Patreon page and sent us a message
[06:52.340 --> 06:56.020]  sharing a regulation-inspired game
[06:56.020 --> 06:58.420]  that they've made that is coming out.
[06:58.420 --> 07:04.160]  It will be free based on the idea that you had, Geoff,
[07:04.980 --> 07:06.360]  of Tombstone Bingo.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.320]  It is called Tombstone Tally.
[07:10.480 --> 07:16.220]  And it is a game in which you run around a cemetery and have to do bingo.
[07:17.140 --> 07:20.140]  It is a scavenger hunt.
[07:20.260 --> 07:21.940]  Yeah, it's going to be on Steam.
[07:22.400 --> 07:23.500]  It's multiplayer.
[07:23.860 --> 07:26.320]  We're absolutely going to play this when it comes out.
[07:26.320 --> 07:28.480]  It is, I guess, supposed to be like...
[07:28.940 --> 07:30.080]  Spicy garlic games.
[07:30.880 --> 07:34.760]  It's supposed to be like a nod to our show and the community.
[07:34.920 --> 07:37.620]  There's a lot of inside jokes, apparently, in the game.
[07:37.880 --> 07:38.820]  It looks great.
[07:39.340 --> 07:41.700]  I cannot believe that this is a thing that's happening.
[07:42.120 --> 07:43.080]  It's full-on bingo.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.800]  You have a bingo card that you pull up.
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.900]  I'm watching like the about this game and everything.
[07:47.340 --> 07:52.060]  You're trying to find specific stuff on these tombstones and you have a bingo card.
[07:52.400 --> 07:53.280]  This is crazy.
[07:53.660 --> 07:54.360]  This is crazy.
[07:54.360 --> 07:56.080]  This is unbelievable.
[07:56.660 --> 08:01.200]  We were trying to find games that have graveyards to try to make something out of like around
[08:01.200 --> 08:01.880]  something else.
[08:02.240 --> 08:05.320]  They just went and made a game that is what you talked about.
[08:05.540 --> 08:06.620]  So is it random?
[08:06.920 --> 08:08.100]  Is it different every time?
[08:08.440 --> 08:09.180]  I have no idea.
[08:09.820 --> 08:10.720]  I can't answer that.
[08:10.760 --> 08:12.620]  But the fact that this is a thing is insane.
[08:12.980 --> 08:14.240]  This is so fucking cool.
[08:14.400 --> 08:17.740]  This game's great because it stops us from doing something really offensive.
[08:18.760 --> 08:19.680]  That was...
[08:19.680 --> 08:21.020]  Thank you so much for that.
[08:21.080 --> 08:22.340]  I really do appreciate it.
[08:22.900 --> 08:24.340]  It wouldn't have been offensive.
[08:24.600 --> 08:26.340]  It would have been a loving send up.
[08:26.740 --> 08:28.020]  It's fighting zombies.
[08:28.180 --> 08:29.200]  This is even better though.
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.120]  This is even better.
[08:31.080 --> 08:33.160]  Yeah, I guess there's like a...
[08:33.160 --> 08:34.040]  I like the ragdoll.
[08:34.580 --> 08:36.220]  Oh yeah, it looks fantastic.
[08:37.360 --> 08:42.780]  So thank you so much to Spicy Garlic Games, I guess, for putting this together.
[08:43.160 --> 08:44.440]  I cannot wait to try this.
[08:44.640 --> 08:46.400]  I am so excited to try this.
[08:46.460 --> 08:47.680]  Do you know when it'll be out?
[08:47.900 --> 08:52.280]  I don't think they have said, but they did say it would be free.
[08:52.340 --> 08:57.460]  Oh, anyone who's listening who has Steam should be able to pick it up and play it, I assume.
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.120]  But I don't know that.
[08:59.700 --> 09:00.940]  That is unbelievably cool.
[09:00.960 --> 09:02.220]  It looks so cool.
[09:02.520 --> 09:04.180]  Running around, you play co-op.
[09:04.500 --> 09:07.320]  It's like a groundskeeper, looks like, that maybe targets you.
[09:07.660 --> 09:08.580]  Looks like a lot of fun.
[09:08.740 --> 09:10.980]  So I just wanted to make sure that we highlighted that.
[09:11.420 --> 09:12.220]  No, absolutely.
[09:13.200 --> 09:15.340]  That's... that is fucking amazing.
[09:16.920 --> 09:20.580]  Second community thing I have, I just might as well just unload on the community stuff.
[09:21.200 --> 09:26.840]  We got sent something that is really cool, that was reached out a long time ago.
[09:26.940 --> 09:32.880]  It's been a long time in the works for this person who owns this business called Hand & Sew,
[09:33.280 --> 09:33.860]  I believe.
[09:34.060 --> 09:38.280]  And they reached out about doing keychains, I guess it's a product that they typically make.
[09:38.700 --> 09:44.960]  And they have made, look at this, an Ian keychain for us.
[09:45.520 --> 09:45.840]  What?
[09:46.260 --> 09:48.180]  And they did 500 of them.
[09:48.180 --> 09:51.280]  Wow, is it like stamped leather with gold foil?
[09:51.660 --> 09:53.100]  I believe so, yes.
[09:53.660 --> 09:54.880]  That is so cool.
[09:55.140 --> 09:57.280]  They're sending them to our PO box.
[09:57.420 --> 10:03.440]  I figured that could be like a fun thing that like we send out to people on occasion.
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.940]  Dude, that is... that is so awesome.
[10:06.140 --> 10:07.020]  That is such a cool idea.
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.580]  And I'm so excited to get actual mail to our PO box instead of mail for the two people
[10:11.580 --> 10:14.560]  that aren't us that I continually have to return.
[10:16.460 --> 10:20.240]  Maybe I could take 10 of those and just give them to people if I see them out in public.
[10:20.440 --> 10:20.820]  Absolutely.
[10:21.440 --> 10:22.740]  I think it's a great idea.
[10:23.100 --> 10:23.960]  I think that's so cool.
[10:24.060 --> 10:25.980]  Getting these sent and everything is really awesome.
[10:26.180 --> 10:28.340]  What was the name of this of the people again?
[10:28.760 --> 10:29.880]  Let me pull it up.
[10:30.080 --> 10:31.120]  I believe it's Hand & Sew.
[10:31.420 --> 10:32.680]  Hand & Sew, I think is what you said.
[10:33.180 --> 10:33.540]  Yes.
[10:34.560 --> 10:35.320]  So cool.
[10:35.680 --> 10:36.180]  Yeah, they're awesome.
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.140]  If we're talking about this stuff that's getting sent to us,
[10:42.700 --> 10:50.140]  can we talk about what we have coming up later in November for what we're merch?
[10:50.440 --> 10:51.340]  I think we probably should.
[10:51.540 --> 10:52.020]  Okay.
[10:52.840 --> 10:54.760]  So it's been a long time coming.
[10:54.920 --> 10:55.440]  This is fun.
[10:55.500 --> 10:56.660]  This is like an announcements episode.
[10:56.720 --> 10:57.280]  This is exciting.
[10:58.420 --> 10:59.680]  It's been a long time coming.
[10:59.780 --> 11:05.380]  We've been working with some people with Tony and some other people to get this going.
[11:05.680 --> 11:08.900]  But we are opening a regulation store.
[11:09.140 --> 11:09.980]  Oh, shit.
[11:10.340 --> 11:12.000]  Later this month.
[11:12.420 --> 11:14.140]  OSHA has nothing to do with this.
[11:14.220 --> 11:22.960]  By the time this is out, we'll have more firm updates on where everything is and dates and
[11:22.960 --> 11:23.320]  everything.
[11:23.980 --> 11:26.300]  But we're opening a regulation store.
[11:27.040 --> 11:32.720]  We're working on getting a regulation shirt that will be very simple.
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.300]  It's really for us to sort of stretch our legs and try this stuff and make sure that
[11:37.300 --> 11:42.840]  we have no issues with what we're trying to sell.
[11:43.420 --> 11:45.740]  So the shirt will be coming out later in October.
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.000]  And then in November, late November, we're trying to settle on the date and everything.
[11:50.060 --> 11:55.900]  But late November, we will be releasing our first ever regulation Gerpler.
[11:56.320 --> 11:57.900]  It's a brand new Gerpler.
[11:58.600 --> 11:59.380]  It is...
[11:59.380 --> 12:01.760]  I mean, should we share images of it and stuff?
[12:01.920 --> 12:03.800]  I don't see why we couldn't.
[12:03.880 --> 12:04.620]  Who's going to stop us?
[12:04.720 --> 12:06.660]  Big Teeth can't stop us, Eric.
[12:06.660 --> 12:12.060]  I mean, it's up to us one way or the other if we're going to do this.
[12:12.360 --> 12:17.780]  So the new Gerpler that we will be releasing is like...
[12:18.580 --> 12:19.520]  What would you call it?
[12:19.560 --> 12:20.960]  Like transparent black?
[12:21.420 --> 12:22.240]  I'm not sure.
[12:22.440 --> 12:24.040]  It's a regulation color.
[12:24.540 --> 12:25.040]  It is.
[12:25.260 --> 12:27.220]  It's a very...
[12:27.820 --> 12:28.840]  It's like smoky.
[12:29.300 --> 12:35.520]  It is like a dusky, low opacity black sort of look.
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.820]  Like an Eastern European cigar lounge at three in the morning.
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.660]  Yeah. And so here, I can share the image here.
[12:44.100 --> 12:52.560]  So what we're sort of looking at is, I think, being able to put this out and you guys are
[12:52.560 --> 12:54.480]  going to be able to get the Gerpler.
[12:54.960 --> 12:55.600]  Yes.
[12:56.060 --> 12:58.320]  It looks fantastic. Very happy about it.
[12:58.320 --> 13:06.400]  We have, I think the number is 4,000 because we wanted to really overestimate.
[13:07.300 --> 13:10.020]  We're taking a bit of a risk here.
[13:11.200 --> 13:15.700]  Trying not to get out ahead of our skis, but the Gerpler has been far and away the
[13:15.700 --> 13:19.000]  most sought after product of all the products we've released time and time again.
[13:19.540 --> 13:25.980]  And we wanted to make as many as we could conceivably make without tanking the company
[13:25.980 --> 13:27.100]  if you don't buy them.
[13:27.100 --> 13:32.240]  The original question from Eric, I think, was, do we want 500 or 1,000?
[13:32.680 --> 13:38.340]  And I just got flat PTSD flashbacks of everyone being pissed off that they didn't get one.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.540]  So I think I put 5,000 and then we settled on four.
[13:42.900 --> 13:47.760]  Yes. I'm always going to be more conservative when it comes to this stuff because I'd rather
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.420]  have it sell out and then we don't eat the cost of having to store it anywhere.
[13:52.240 --> 13:52.660]  So...
[13:52.660 --> 13:53.400]  See, that's where we differ.
[13:53.400 --> 13:59.240]  I'd rather have a really funny amount of cups left over than have everyone be really mad.
[14:00.420 --> 14:05.220]  Well, a very funny amount of cups left over to me is zero cups.
[14:05.800 --> 14:08.360]  I want no...
[14:08.360 --> 14:15.780]  So I am putting this in the community's hands and saying, please buy these cups in late
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.680]  November because we have a lot.
[14:17.820 --> 14:19.240]  Yeah, we have a lot.
[14:19.240 --> 14:24.880]  And I think that obviously we can have further discussions about this, but I think with
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.100]  trying to move that many, we probably wouldn't put a limit on number either.
[14:30.520 --> 14:30.960]  So...
[14:30.960 --> 14:34.720]  Yeah, I agree. And I think probably maybe trying to do like a live stream in support
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.940]  of it and everything. We have a lot of ideas, but we finally got this stuff. I got the sample.
[14:40.140 --> 14:46.840]  We finally have the look of it. We settled on a lot of stuff. It's very... man.
[14:46.840 --> 14:50.480]  Believe it or not, we started working on this in early June.
[14:50.960 --> 14:55.660]  Yeah. And there were there were shades of transparent black that we weren't happy with.
[14:55.880 --> 14:56.560]  Oh my God.
[14:56.780 --> 14:56.960]  Yeah.
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.620]  We went through a lot of samples to get this right for you guys because we wanted it to be
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.760]  a very specific look. We wanted it to be regulation. And it looks awesome. It looks so cool.
[15:08.840 --> 15:14.140]  And we're working with a company called El Famoso to put it all together and do this.
[15:14.140 --> 15:20.180]  So we're really excited to be able to get new stuff in the store and make everything happen
[15:20.180 --> 15:24.280]  and get more stuff out to you guys. So stay tuned.
[15:24.560 --> 15:31.000]  Super, super excited. And this is going to be very informative for us. If we release 4,000
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.940]  and they sell out immediately, we're so sorry. That is an insane amount of demand
[15:35.940 --> 15:43.160]  that we couldn't afford to seed ahead of time. But it will help us know if we release 4,000
[15:43.160 --> 15:48.880]  and we have 3,800 at the end of the month. Then Gavin will have his funny amount of cups and
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.840]  we'll end up building an island out of cups and trying to move off to it to avoid paying taxes
[15:53.840 --> 16:00.720]  or something. But yeah, just we will take the information that we've learned for this. We
[16:00.720 --> 16:08.020]  desperately want everybody to get an item if they want it. We really do. And so just so that
[16:08.020 --> 16:12.540]  you know, just because we're releasing 4,000 in this way, this isn't how things are going to go.
[16:12.540 --> 16:18.280]  This is us testing the waters to see what tolerance you guys have, what you actually
[16:18.280 --> 16:23.320]  want from us. And then based on that, we'll go forward in merch. But we have mentioned a lot
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.420]  early on that merch wasn't going to be a focus from the beginning. We were really more concerned
[16:27.420 --> 16:33.380]  about just crafting the best product for you guys and really filling that out and then using merch
[16:33.380 --> 16:39.780]  to, I don't know, support that down the road. That's still kind of the path. This is us slow
[16:39.780 --> 16:45.500]  walking this. It is. And try to be very careful with it. We don't want there to be a problem on
[16:45.500 --> 16:49.280]  launch. We don't want you guys to have a problem on launch. We're terrified of that. Yeah, that
[16:49.280 --> 16:54.760]  would be awful. That's obviously something that's why we're putting in time and figuring stuff out.
[16:54.820 --> 17:00.160]  And our number one issue when we're doing merch before was the frustration of things selling out.
[17:00.520 --> 17:05.920]  So this is an attempt on our behalf of what is the furthest we can push it while also attempting
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.640]  to make sure that everyone who wants one can get one. And then based on the intel or data we
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.760]  receive from this, we'll adjust. I don't doubt that there won't be unforeseen problems. Oh, it's us.
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.960]  The site could go down. Who knows? Yeah, it's us. Something will go wrong. Undeniably. And we should
[17:23.960 --> 17:29.080]  also say that, you know, extra thanks to everyone who's supporting us on Patreon because of that,
[17:29.140 --> 17:35.900]  we can buy 4,000 of something. Oh, there's no way we could have done this if it
[17:35.900 --> 17:40.400]  wasn't for people supporting us on Patreon. There's no shot. We wouldn't have been in conversations.
[17:40.640 --> 17:44.760]  We wouldn't have been able to get as many tests as we got. Like, we wouldn't have been able to do
[17:44.760 --> 17:49.620]  this the way we wanted to. This fucking company begins and ends with Patreon. They really,
[17:50.160 --> 17:55.920]  they are the lifeblood of what we're doing. And man, now I'm going to get into the blowjob
[17:55.920 --> 18:02.800]  portion of the episode, but I was thinking about that yesterday when I was getting coffee in the
[18:02.800 --> 18:09.780]  morning. It's unbelievable, the consistent from day one and continuous groundswell of support
[18:10.300 --> 18:17.260]  that the regulation listeners and comment leavers have really granted us. I don't know. I
[18:17.920 --> 18:22.040]  genuinely, I don't know about you guys, we're six months down the road now, five months down the road
[18:22.040 --> 18:27.000]  into this company, but I still wake up every day and I'm just fucking floored that it's what
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.060]  we're going to be doing. That I'm going to sit down in front of a computer with y'all and get to
[18:30.060 --> 18:37.440]  this stuff out. It's beyond a dream come true. It's so weird because we hit the ground running
[18:37.440 --> 18:42.820]  so hard. I never really had time to look back, but we're six months down the road from rooster
[18:42.820 --> 18:49.660]  teeth going under and all of that. And it's just crazy to be able to look back amongst the last
[18:49.660 --> 18:55.640]  six months and we didn't skip a beat. We didn't slow down. And it's only because of the audience.
[18:55.640 --> 19:02.280]  Oh, a hundred percent. For transparency too, I mean, with us moving down six months and everything,
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.160]  we've got a lot of the backend stuff figured out. We have like a lot of our, our sort of like
[19:07.160 --> 19:12.880]  business operations figured out and everything. But for transparency sake, we started working
[19:12.880 --> 19:17.840]  with Shelby, who's someone that we started working with at Achievement Hunter and Rooster Teeth and
[19:17.840 --> 19:22.900]  everything to help us with our social media and posting, because we want to get clips out
[19:22.900 --> 19:28.600]  to show people what the show is. Because as much as we have a devoted fan base in you guys who are
[19:28.600 --> 19:33.360]  listening to this every week and, you know, very into it and everything, there are twice as many
[19:33.360 --> 19:39.320]  people who go, Hey, so Rooster Teeth shut down. What are you doing now? And we need help getting
[19:39.320 --> 19:44.020]  like the word out. And Shelby's doing a really great job so far, like putting that stuff together
[19:44.020 --> 19:49.260]  and getting that stuff out there. So that way more people can check out the show and we can continue
[19:49.260 --> 19:54.820]  to grow, but not in a way that is like an insane exponential thing, just in a way where we can like
[19:54.820 --> 19:59.820]  keep doing what we're doing the way that we want to do it. Yeah, we're not going to end up selling
[19:59.820 --> 20:05.160]  shirts that like none of us have seen, which I think did happen a few times. Yes. And I made
[20:05.160 --> 20:11.560]  sure yesterday that everyone saw that shirt and we walked in on it. You're talking about appreciation,
[20:11.880 --> 20:16.500]  Geoff, with the thing and like, like feeling it every day. It is, I am like obnoxiously
[20:16.500 --> 20:21.980]  appreciative where I think about like every day, as you said, it comes up and I've made probably
[20:21.980 --> 20:26.720]  like seven or eight posts about it. And it's just like every day I want to make another. But like,
[20:26.800 --> 20:32.700]  it's hard to because it's it's not like the audience can know how you're feeling at all
[20:32.700 --> 20:37.360]  times. So it's like this weird thing of like, I am so fucking thankful for the support we've
[20:37.360 --> 20:44.440]  received and just overwhelmed by everything. And it's just been so much fun building this
[20:44.440 --> 20:49.420]  and trying to create something that is both so much fun for us and connects with the people that
[20:49.420 --> 20:56.420]  are kind enough and for whatever reason, believe in us. I guess ultimately, I agree with you
[20:56.420 --> 21:01.880]  completely. And I guess ultimately, I just want the audience to know whether you pay through
[21:01.880 --> 21:06.840]  Patreon or whether you just listen through the Apple podcast app or Spotify, or you just watch
[21:06.840 --> 21:15.140]  a couple of gameplays on YouTube. Just we do not take it for granted. We are so fucking
[21:16.000 --> 21:24.920]  cognizant and conscious of how lucky we are and the runway you've given us to get to continue to
[21:24.920 --> 21:28.120]  create this kind of content. And I just I just want you to know we don't take it for granted.
[21:28.320 --> 21:33.240]  We appreciate it every single day of our lives. Couldn't have said it better. I feel like that
[21:33.240 --> 21:38.760]  little sausage talk. Oh, before we move off of our little sausage talk, you may note of it, Eric,
[21:39.180 --> 21:42.940]  but we're doing Tony stuff with the merch Alphamosa. And it's also like some rooster teeth
[21:42.940 --> 21:48.980]  people that were that were there, which I think is so cool. Tony, the catalyst of so many of our
[21:48.980 --> 21:55.400]  just dumbest ideas and being able to work with him in some capacity going forward was really
[21:55.400 --> 22:01.800]  important to us. And so being able to do that, it is so exciting. I am texting Tony about stuff
[22:02.380 --> 22:08.780]  occasionally that I'm whenever I'm able to text Tony about a dumb idea and then seeing him
[22:08.780 --> 22:14.500]  like the gears turn and figure out a way and like different angles on what it's incredible.
[22:14.780 --> 22:20.060]  I'm so excited for the potential of what the future can bring as far as the merch stuff goes.
[22:21.940 --> 22:28.540]  This is an ad for Fume. Are you aware? Yes, you, the person I'm talking to. Are you aware that the
[22:28.540 --> 22:33.760]  flavored air category is quickly becoming the leading alternative to vaping and smoking? Are
[22:33.760 --> 22:40.000]  you aware that there is such a thing as the flavored air category? Well, there is. And it's
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.740]  led by today's sponsor, Fume. I just said their name earlier and here I am saying it again.
[22:44.980 --> 22:49.120]  That's Fume. We've teamed up with Fume and they are offering you a free gift with your journey

[23:05.760 --> 23:12.380]  It's won awards. It's not the V word, so you can use it anywhere. There's no nicotine,
[23:12.720 --> 23:16.700]  so it can't be addictive in that way. There are non-toxic flavors,

[23:21.220 --> 23:25.440]  to charge it, which is quite convenient. Remember when it used to be gum that had
[23:25.440 --> 23:30.300]  all the cool flavors? But they were bad for you. It was bad for your teeth. And now gum,
[23:30.400 --> 23:35.240]  it's just like seven different kinds of spearmint. Well, Fume has crisp mint,

[23:52.000 --> 23:59.720]  order today. I have a small follow up. Geoff, you were talking about your face recently where you
[23:59.720 --> 24:04.280]  had to go and find Nick a bunch of old episodes. Yeah, because you named them all stupid and
[24:04.280 --> 24:09.380]  because of pleasantries. How long did it take you to get your files? So long. It was really hard.
[24:09.380 --> 24:18.440]  I did the same ones. Three minutes. Son of a bitch. Go to my thing and just drag them over.
[24:21.800 --> 24:26.160]  I have an unfortunate update. Moving away from our sausage talk portion.
[24:27.400 --> 24:34.540]  My chair broke. Oh! The chair is broken again. It was September again. It's the month of breaking
[24:34.540 --> 24:39.240]  chairs. When did it break? What date did it break? Over the weekend. I put it in the
[24:39.240 --> 24:46.900]  slack. What is today? Today is October 3rd. It was right at the end of September. How did it break?
[24:47.320 --> 24:53.120]  What level of broke? This is the Herman Miller, right? This is the Herman Miller. You never gave
[24:53.120 --> 24:59.380]  us the instructional information on how to use the chair. We're going to get into this. So I got the
[24:59.380 --> 25:06.900]  Herman Miller and it's great. It's a really nice chair. On day two, a bolt fell out of the side of
[25:07.460 --> 25:12.860]  on the second day and my seat like my seat dropped. So how? I don't know. If you have one of
[25:12.860 --> 25:18.140]  these, you'll know what I mean. But the way the armrests work, a bolt goes through the armrests
[25:18.140 --> 25:24.000]  and that's what holds the seat up on each side. Did you build this chair? No, it came pre-assembled.
[25:24.100 --> 25:29.760]  Okay. So on the second day, I sit and the bolt on one of the sides falls out and I thought
[25:29.760 --> 25:35.120]  un-fucking-believable. This chair broke two days in. This is a top-of-the-line high-end chair.
[25:35.120 --> 25:41.240]  I looked at it. I went and I got a screwdriver. I was able to secure the bolt back in. So I thought
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.760]  that's fine. Whatever. Like clearly, this is not set up correctly, but I can just tighten it
[25:46.760 --> 25:51.740]  whenever it gets loose. And so that is what I had been doing this entire time. Occasionally,
[25:51.740 --> 25:55.580]  it would fall out and I'd have to completely tighten it from the beginning.
[25:56.080 --> 26:03.040]  I was just a process I was doing. I had noticed recently that it was looking not great on that
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.940]  one side, like it was getting progressively worse. And so I took the Herman Miller chair
[26:08.940 --> 26:13.820]  and I put it on top of the bed just so I could like really evaluate things.
[26:13.920 --> 26:22.320]  And I tightened it. And while it was on the bed, I thought, well, this is a great time for me to
[26:22.320 --> 26:30.420]  look at all these different levers and switches and figure out this stuff. And so I looked at it
[26:30.420 --> 26:34.380]  and it all was like, OK, interesting. This does that. This is that is looking at the instructions
[26:34.380 --> 26:39.420]  is going to be all prepared. I learned how to raise the chair because it has just been at the lowest
[26:39.420 --> 26:48.000]  height this entire time. What do you mean? You what do you mean? It's the most commonly used
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.220]  thing on the chair. Yeah, I just I've never it's always been at the lowest setting.
[26:53.720 --> 27:00.200]  And so I raised it. I was like, I'll be able to bring up on the show like I figured out where the
[27:00.420 --> 27:07.160]  seat switches. Let me guess. It was just it was below your ass on the right side somewhere.
[27:07.500 --> 27:14.480]  No, it's it's like on the armrest thing, I believe. Even even easier. Yeah. Anyway,
[27:14.820 --> 27:21.000]  so I raised it and then I sat in it and the chair exploded.
[27:22.720 --> 27:30.180]  So what did what happened is the bolt that was supporting it flew out and it stripped.
[27:30.380 --> 27:36.960]  It not only took the inner bolt with it, it stripped all of the the inside of the chair.
[27:37.420 --> 27:43.360]  So I can't turn your chair into like a hydraulic cannon. Essentially. Yeah, I guess what happened
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.740]  is because it was at the lowest height, it was just there was no give for it. So even though it
[27:49.740 --> 27:56.500]  was crooked, like it was fine. But then when I gave it space, when I elevated it, it had like
[27:56.500 --> 28:00.220]  it's been broken, I guess, this whole this whole time. And I just didn't know.
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.260]  I thought I was fixing it each time when I would tighten it. But really, it was just still broken.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.400]  So it shot out. And now is it now? What does the chair do?
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.720]  Now the chair has no support on the left side of it.
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.900]  I mean, it's it's a Herman Miller, right? So they'll probably replace it still. It's probably a warranty.
[28:22.300 --> 28:28.040]  Here's the problem. Yeah. I got sent all of that information on my Rooster Teeth email because it
[28:28.040 --> 28:33.560]  was from the whole idea was we're going to do stuff around the chair and then Rooster Teeth
[28:33.560 --> 28:39.940]  got shut down, as you may know. But your email is still on your mail app, right? I don't have any
[28:39.940 --> 28:47.400]  access to that inbox. You never downloaded any? We went over this. No, I had zero. I didn't know
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.160]  you could download the inbox. It never occurred to me that I would want to. I like that he sounds
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.660]  mad at you about this. No, not mad at you in the slightest. I should have done that. I just didn't.
[28:56.820 --> 29:02.440]  Did you use the mail app on your Mac? No. Or were you just in the browser? Browser.
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.880]  You're a browser guy, aren't you? You're a real browser. My mail doesn't work on my computer.
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.520]  And I don't know what's going on with that. What do you mean? Let's get into this. I am so excited. I'm so
[29:15.520 --> 29:19.960]  thrilled by the turn this episode just took. And your computer stuff makes me so happy.
[29:20.480 --> 29:25.400]  So the chair's dead. I've ordered another chair. I'm hoping I can find the paperwork and I can
[29:25.400 --> 29:30.740]  potentially get this one repaired. But if not, I'm just... I have to swap out chairs. My computer
[29:30.740 --> 29:39.840]  problem. At some point. So I was using the Safari mail client. And my... What? What? The stamp.
[29:40.280 --> 29:45.340]  The stamp. Mail. Mail. Whatever. Why did you say Safari? Safari has nothing to do with the mail app.
[29:45.660 --> 29:53.980]  Doesn't. They're both blue. Anyway, I was using the postage stamp and I sent a bunch of emails out
[29:54.740 --> 29:59.920]  and it didn't go through. And then I re-sent those emails out using the browser.
[30:01.160 --> 30:07.600]  And the postage stamp said we've... we're out of sync. Or something. Let me just try to open...
[30:07.600 --> 30:12.420]  I'll just click the mail thing and see what it says. It said something like the SMTP Google
[30:12.420 --> 30:16.840]  blah blah blah. Like it was not. I'd have to re-sync it. You might just need to sign in
[30:17.380 --> 30:22.540]  again on your accounts. Probably. In mail accounts and settings. I was concerned
[30:23.400 --> 30:29.480]  that all of the emails I sent... because I tried to send those emails and it was like, ah, didn't
[30:29.480 --> 30:35.600]  go through. Like, didn't work. Then I sent them on the browser. I was worried that if I ever fixed
[30:35.600 --> 30:41.240]  the mail thing, then all those emails would then get shot out a second time. I mean, are they all
[30:41.240 --> 30:45.980]  sat in your outbox? Because you could just delete them from there. Well, let's see. I'm opening my
[30:45.980 --> 30:53.360]  mail. But because of that, I haven't used the mail postage stamp thing in probably three years?
[30:53.700 --> 30:56.860]  So you've got all your emails from Rooster Teeth, but from three years ago.
[30:57.360 --> 31:01.980]  I yeah, I get. Well, I mean, I'm trying to open this thing and nothing is happening.
[31:03.320 --> 31:07.620]  I guess I haven't clicked it. He's talking about it like it's a physical box.
[31:07.940 --> 31:12.720]  Like, I'm trying to open this thing and it's stuck. Blowing off the dust.
[31:14.300 --> 31:18.360]  Well, it was, you know, it was also a problem because I just at some point decided to stop
[31:18.360 --> 31:24.760]  deleting emails. So I have 30,000 emails that are unread currently. This thing.
[31:27.400 --> 31:31.340]  The last one I received was from 2020, December 11th.
[31:35.680 --> 31:42.080]  And there's a little squiggly line that looks like the messenger app. Does present day you
[31:42.080 --> 31:50.600]  just hate future you? No, I'm good. I use the browser. I'm fine. Yeah, but doesn't don't you
[31:50.600 --> 31:57.480]  hate past you? No. I think there's no thought. I don't think that there's a thought of like
[31:57.480 --> 32:02.040]  linear time with like, I'm going to have to deal with this or why am I having to deal with this
[32:02.040 --> 32:09.120]  now? It is just simply this exists. I haven't received. I have 30,000 unread emails. Here's
[32:09.120 --> 32:14.100]  the thing with the emails. I was on top of it. I would delete them every time they'd show up.
[32:14.140 --> 32:19.840]  I click delete, get rid of. Why are you just deleting them? To get rid of them. Why do you
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.440]  want to get rid of them? Isn't that what you're supposed to do? I went back to an email that I
[32:24.440 --> 32:30.120]  got in 2012 because I did it this week. I don't understand why you're deleting the emails in your
[32:30.120 --> 32:37.980]  inbox. You don't put them in your trash by deleting them. I'm not asking what it does, I'm asking why
[32:37.980 --> 32:42.780]  do you do it? Oh, that's what I'm. No. OK, I'm trying to articulate. Isn't that what everyone
[32:42.780 --> 32:47.760]  does? Doesn't everyone delete you read and you delete it? I remember the last time I deleted an
[32:47.760 --> 32:53.380]  email is when I was using my Hotmail account in 2003 and then Gmail came out. Oh, people don't
[32:53.380 --> 32:58.640]  delete. And then no one ever had to delete an email ever again. So I was actively deleting,
[32:58.880 --> 33:03.300]  but then it felt like there's no end to this. And I just gave up. And that's why I have 30,000.
[33:04.560 --> 33:09.860]  I can't stop this wave. The dam had broke. I'm getting emails every day. I can't stop.
[33:09.860 --> 33:15.520]  Why is that? Why is that? Is that an issue? Yeah, what's the deal? It's because I was trying to stay
[33:15.520 --> 33:20.500]  on top of it and get them deleted. So it was like I was creating work for myself that would never
[33:20.500 --> 33:25.120]  end. There is no end to this job. Reading them is getting on top of them. Why does deleting them
[33:25.120 --> 33:33.340]  have to be on top of? I haven't been on top of emails since about 2007, 2008, when I got a
[33:33.340 --> 33:40.540]  Gmail account. Enter the password for the account to authenticate. Geoff, are we nuts? Do you delete
[33:40.540 --> 33:48.700]  your emails? No, I have Gmail, so I don't need to really delete my emails unless it's, you know,
[33:48.700 --> 33:57.560]  obvious trash. All of it, though, is so there's no sort for my Safari letter email thing.
[33:59.600 --> 34:04.140]  So it's it's like PAX team. I'm not going to click that. I don't need to read about
[34:04.140 --> 34:09.160]  PAX in 2020. Twitch notification. I don't care about that. I'm not clicking that.
[34:09.440 --> 34:12.420]  I don't think anyone's saying you should go and read all your 2020 emails.
[34:13.080 --> 34:17.280]  No, I'm saying even when they came out at the time, go back to 2020. I don't need to read that.
[34:17.280 --> 34:19.480]  Are you explaining the concept of...
[34:28.390 --> 34:36.670]  What? I'm explaining what? I've been laughing so hard. I'm like losing my mind.
[34:37.090 --> 34:41.510]  This is like, why are you telling us what your emails are?
[34:42.050 --> 34:46.170]  OK, here's what I'll give you an example. Say I got six emails. Say six emails came in.
[34:46.170 --> 34:50.350]  A bunch of them is like mailing lists. Maybe it might be like an order confirmation.
[34:50.730 --> 34:56.030]  Maybe there's one email that I need to read and reply to. I'll just arrow through them just like
[34:56.690 --> 35:01.330]  that. I've dealt with all those. And then I replied to the one I want. And that's it. That's
[35:01.330 --> 35:06.570]  all I do. Yeah, but the little blue dot doesn't go away unless you click it. It's not true. What
[35:06.570 --> 35:11.630]  do you mean? The little blue dot doesn't go away unless you click it. Well, you click it, right?
[35:11.630 --> 35:16.910]  Then you just use the arrows and go up. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. And then they'll
[35:16.910 --> 35:25.230]  all not be blue. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Or just get used to the idea that the blue dot can exist. Yeah.
[35:26.210 --> 35:33.130]  It doesn't matter. This is my point. This is what I'm saying. Yes. So if I'm getting 50 emails a day
[35:33.130 --> 35:37.630]  and I'm trying to keep that number low, I'm having to do the boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
[35:37.630 --> 35:43.970]  every day. And that's endless. That is an endless. I'm never done. I've never finished.
[35:44.270 --> 35:50.970]  No, it sounds like it ends at 50. Oh, listen, 50. I'm doing it every day. I'm doing it 50 times a
[35:50.970 --> 35:55.570]  day. I don't want to do it 50 times a day. I mean, you can also block and mark stuff as spam
[35:55.570 --> 36:00.750]  and you can unsubscribe from a lot of... I don't get actually that many emails anymore. Neither do
[36:00.750 --> 36:08.330]  I. At this point, let me tell you, my inbox in 2020 was popping off. It was going crazy with
[36:08.330 --> 36:14.750]  stuff I had no interest in reading. I can't authenticate this, so it's just a bunch of...
[36:16.530 --> 36:19.810]  You're not trying to log into Rooster Teeth now, are you? Because you can't.
[36:20.050 --> 36:24.610]  No, I'm trying to log into my personal one. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[36:26.350 --> 36:29.510]  He's going to print the law by accident. This is going to do something.
[36:29.510 --> 36:33.550]  Oh, no, this is the... I talked about this before where it's broken. It just doesn't work.
[36:35.490 --> 36:41.290]  It's broken. It's broken. Yeah, it's the account thing. Sorry. This is not... Sorry. My point is
[36:41.290 --> 36:47.410]  emails. It's too many. I got too many. He hasn't been deleting them fast enough.
[36:47.710 --> 36:53.190]  But I don't need this Fitbit one from December 11, 2020. Hey, that's fine. But
[36:54.370 --> 37:00.470]  2020, December 11. The source. It's official. Cyberpunk 2077 is finally here.
[37:00.830 --> 37:09.970]  You don't need to deal with it. Ignore it. I know I can't because it'll bother me. I either have...
[37:09.970 --> 37:13.670]  So I do ignore it. That's what I'm doing. All right. And then it's to say you've dealt with
[37:13.670 --> 37:17.670]  everything you need to. You've still got 30,000. Just do it. You know, Command A,
[37:17.670 --> 37:23.890]  job done. Command A? Yeah, that will select everything. One second.
[37:27.730 --> 37:32.250]  This is going to be an all-timer, isn't it? Like we're in the middle of an all-timer. I'm on...
[37:32.250 --> 37:37.070]  I'm using... Okay, so I'm using a Windows keyboard on my Mac. How do I do Command A? Okay,
[37:37.190 --> 37:43.550]  the button next to the space bar and A. Alt A. Yeah. Nothing's happening. Oh,
[37:44.490 --> 37:51.450]  it's pinwheeling. This whole thing's about to crash. Oh, Gavin, you just messed with the
[37:51.450 --> 37:56.210]  whole house of cards. It's about to crumble. This is like when Gavin mentioned that we
[37:56.210 --> 37:59.530]  weren't having any technical problems before we recorded our Let's Play this morning.
[37:59.930 --> 38:05.490]  What Let's Play? It's just... 49 minutes later, we did... we gave up.
[38:05.910 --> 38:09.110]  We'll continue. I don't want to hog the whole show with this stuff.
[38:09.110 --> 38:15.630]  So you're not hogging, don't worry. Well, going back to the chair, is that four chairs in four
[38:15.630 --> 38:25.730]  Septembers now? Yes. Or is it three? One, two, yeah, four. Chair five is coming. Okay, so is
[38:25.730 --> 38:31.990]  chair five a different chair? Yes. You didn't just... well, I mean, the warranty on a Herman
[38:31.990 --> 38:36.270]  Miller's got to be several years. Yeah, but he's got to find the fucking paper. I don't have any
[38:36.270 --> 38:42.030]  of the forms that prove that I have this legally. Yeah, I guess you were given it.
[38:43.190 --> 38:49.270]  Yeah, you might be SOL. I'm sure they'll just help you though. You would think, I don't know.
[38:49.550 --> 38:54.410]  I'll keep it updated on that. I don't even have the email, the person that I originally talked
[38:54.410 --> 39:00.050]  to for this. Right, isn't that what got us talking about all this stuff? Are you okay? No, I'm saying
[39:00.050 --> 39:07.930]  I don't have the address. I thought about reaching out on my personal email. I don't know
[39:07.930 --> 39:14.350]  how to find them. Do you have an old phone that downloaded your email? Does the hot dog phone have
[39:14.350 --> 39:21.790]  email? They all have email. So you might have a time capsule of that inbox still on one of those
[39:21.790 --> 39:28.430]  phones. Huh, I still have all those phones. Unless you were using the browser on the phone as well.
[39:28.430 --> 39:34.170]  No, I was always using the app on the phone. Okay, well then Gavin might have solved your
[39:34.170 --> 39:42.990]  problem right there. Maybe I take all of my broken phones to an iFixit, like a repair place,
[39:43.150 --> 39:50.530]  and see if they can fix all my phones simultaneously. I really want to spend the whole day
[39:50.530 --> 39:56.150]  just watching you. I have to do it. I need to see all the weird shit you do.
[39:57.050 --> 40:04.150]  You find a day one problem and band-aid it, and then by day 90 you've got a stack of band-aids.
[40:05.350 --> 40:12.690]  And on day 365 they explode. I mean, yeah, that's fair. Shoot across the room.
[40:13.670 --> 40:18.570]  I like your phone idea. I'm gonna explore that. I'm gonna explore the chair thing. Hopefully
[40:18.570 --> 40:23.370]  the new chair is good. I just want a chair. I just want a chair that doesn't explode.
[40:25.350 --> 40:28.330]  I think most people have that. Or if it does, at least tap it on camera. Yeah.
[40:28.590 --> 40:30.170]  We just have to build a better band-aid.
[40:34.080 --> 40:43.700]  So that's my chair update. I fulfilled a request by you, Gavin.
[40:44.960 --> 40:51.580]  I just still can't believe that the only time you tried to learn the chair was like after a year,
[40:51.580 --> 40:57.700]  and you put it on the bed. We were so excited for you to learn the chair right when you got it.
[40:58.100 --> 41:02.120]  Were you conscious that it was September and you were closing in on a year?
[41:02.260 --> 41:05.260]  Were you like, I'm fucking close to beating the record?
[41:05.640 --> 41:08.980]  No, I'm gonna be honest. I didn't even know there was a September pattern.
[41:09.620 --> 41:10.460]  Didn't occur to me.
[41:10.560 --> 41:12.020]  I feel like we've talked about it in the past a lot.
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.860]  Yeah, it's just, when Gavin brought it up, when I said I broke it on the Slack channel,
[41:17.080 --> 41:19.680]  and Gavin brought up the September thing, I went, okay, I guess that's a thing.
[41:19.680 --> 41:22.720]  Who can remember yesterday? I totally am right there with you.
[41:24.080 --> 41:26.540]  I got a nipple review for Gavin.
[41:27.100 --> 41:28.200]  Oh, Eddie Murphy?
[41:28.520 --> 41:34.800]  Eddie Murphy's nipple review. Let me find my specific notes, because as you may remember,
[41:34.920 --> 41:40.560]  this was a conversation that I didn't, my mom didn't know that I talked about on the show.
[41:40.580 --> 41:42.020]  Yeah, how did you get around that?
[41:42.500 --> 41:45.080]  I just had to come out and be honest about it.
[41:45.760 --> 41:47.620]  Trying to figure out where I wrote it down.
[41:47.760 --> 41:54.620]  It is probably the most I've ever wished I recorded a conversation in my life.
[41:54.780 --> 41:59.960]  For learning that that was a public opinion that was known.
[42:02.100 --> 42:05.060]  I'll just give you the current review of the Eddie Murphy thing.
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.960]  I showed her the photo that you sent of Eddie Murphy's nipples,
[42:07.960 --> 42:12.040]  and her initial response was, that's photoshopped.
[42:12.040 --> 42:15.200]  And then I said, no, I don't think it is.
[42:15.640 --> 42:20.260]  And she had to enhance because she didn't have her glasses on when I showed her.
[42:21.780 --> 42:26.380]  And she said they were twisted, it appeared, and understood your take
[42:26.380 --> 42:28.220]  that they were weird nipples.
[42:28.560 --> 42:29.800]  So she's with you.
[42:29.920 --> 42:32.640]  Full support of the weird nipples.
[42:32.880 --> 42:34.720]  I didn't, I don't think I said they were weird. I said they were small.
[42:35.400 --> 42:37.240]  I thought the whole point was they were strange.
[42:38.060 --> 42:38.700]  Doesn't matter.
[42:38.900 --> 42:39.940]  Anyway, that was the review.
[42:39.940 --> 42:40.940]  She thinks they're.
[42:42.160 --> 42:43.360]  The learning.
[42:43.660 --> 42:46.660]  So it was an immediate when I told her that I said that.
[42:47.520 --> 42:51.580]  It was an immediate embarrassment was the reaction.
[42:51.760 --> 42:54.400]  What is it like the seven stages of whatever?
[42:54.840 --> 42:57.940]  We really ran through the emotional spectrum.
[42:58.160 --> 43:04.260]  It was initially complete embarrassment that this was a thing that people knew that she thought.
[43:04.960 --> 43:05.320]  Then denial.
[43:05.320 --> 43:13.840]  Then it was a well, what was the consensus from everybody else and me explaining that
[43:13.840 --> 43:23.300]  it was not shared the opinion that she had to then rage that and disbelief.
[43:23.540 --> 43:24.020]  Rage.
[43:24.420 --> 43:30.840]  That rage might be a strong word, but disbelief that this was an opinion that was not universally
[43:30.840 --> 43:39.540]  shared based off of what was done and a declarative statement that if y'all think that's what normal
[43:39.540 --> 43:43.660]  nipples look like, you don't you've never seen a normal nipple in your life, I believe was
[43:43.660 --> 43:44.760]  a paraphrasing.
[43:44.880 --> 43:53.120]  I don't have direct notes and that she is a much better authority on nipples as somebody
[43:53.120 --> 44:00.280]  who has worked in a medicinal medical field in which she had to see them all the time.
[44:01.620 --> 44:07.040]  She then asked, so did we all look from that movie?
[44:08.040 --> 44:09.340]  And I said, I don't remember.
[44:09.440 --> 44:10.040]  I don't think so.
[44:10.100 --> 44:15.400]  I think it was just what was available when you searched it, to which she then countered
[44:15.400 --> 44:18.360]  that that is a key point of this belief.
[44:19.120 --> 44:25.980]  She thinks that it has to be specifically from this film, the imagery, and that she
[44:25.980 --> 44:31.760]  is uncomfortable declaring any other versions of the nipples being weird.
[44:32.280 --> 44:35.160]  So we need to see them in motion specifically from that movie.
[44:35.380 --> 44:41.900]  She said that her belief is that the nipples in the past may be normal, but that having
[44:41.900 --> 44:44.560]  a child impacted the nipples.
[44:45.860 --> 44:50.960]  This is post-childbirth nipples was the statement.
[44:51.480 --> 44:54.220]  So that's where we're at with the nipple review.
[44:54.860 --> 44:55.160]  Huh?
[44:55.840 --> 44:57.860]  She wants everyone to see the movie.
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.240]  Has she had a child?
[45:00.080 --> 45:00.760]  She has.
[45:01.100 --> 45:05.960]  Has she mentioned any changes to her nipples in the media?
[45:07.060 --> 45:09.580]  I haven't looked, so I don't know.
[45:10.360 --> 45:11.080]  I can't say.
[45:12.040 --> 45:13.180]  But it is the most...
[45:13.180 --> 45:17.160]  Oh, man, it was a crazy conversation to have over the phone.
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.080]  It was very funny.
[45:18.660 --> 45:22.440]  There was a guy on one of the British seasons of Love Island who had to have nipple surgery.
[45:23.180 --> 45:23.600]  Why?
[45:24.220 --> 45:26.480]  His nipples were... weird.
[45:27.160 --> 45:28.100]  I don't know what to say.
[45:28.280 --> 45:29.340]  I never really explained why.
[45:29.600 --> 45:30.380]  They had to be moved.
[45:30.400 --> 45:31.160]  They never clarified?
[45:31.640 --> 45:33.700]  So he never... you never saw them?
[45:34.100 --> 45:35.940]  No, they're just... they look a little weird.
[45:36.140 --> 45:39.400]  And then you find out somewhere through the idea that he did have some sort of a cosmetic
[45:39.400 --> 45:39.800]  surgery.
[45:40.460 --> 45:40.640]  Huh.
[45:40.860 --> 45:42.320]  It'll be on a season you'll watch at some point.
[45:42.860 --> 45:44.140]  There's still... he's still together with the lady.
[45:44.460 --> 45:46.460]  I need to run this by my mom.
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.760]  I think people would want to do... like maybe it's like a Falcon thing, a Q&A that my mom
[45:52.760 --> 45:53.060]  does.
[45:53.060 --> 45:55.900]  Like people could write questions to her to answer.
[45:56.120 --> 45:57.260]  Ah, so good.
[45:57.760 --> 45:59.240]  I think they would absolutely love to.
[45:59.700 --> 46:01.100]  Would your mother enjoy that though?
[46:01.600 --> 46:02.440]  That would be the thing.
[46:02.720 --> 46:03.160]  I don't know.
[46:03.220 --> 46:04.400]  I'd have to talk to her about it.
[46:05.020 --> 46:09.200]  I don't... it definitely would be a thing she'd be nervous about, but I don't think
[46:09.200 --> 46:10.560]  she'd mind answering the questions.
[46:10.700 --> 46:13.060]  It's the idea of it being reported would be the hurdle.
[46:13.720 --> 46:15.620]  But I feel like people would be interested.
[46:16.320 --> 46:17.280]  Yeah, I want to submit.
[46:17.760 --> 46:21.220]  Did we kill Taggart from Beverly Hills Cop?
[46:22.160 --> 46:22.560]  Probably.
[46:23.080 --> 46:24.580]  Yeah, I definitely talked about him.
[46:25.380 --> 46:25.960]  Here's the thing.
[46:26.960 --> 46:27.580]  Never mind.
[46:27.620 --> 46:28.400]  I'm not going to say that.
[46:28.560 --> 46:29.500]  I'm not going to.
[46:29.920 --> 46:32.360]  Oh, man.
[46:33.420 --> 46:34.520]  Go ahead and say it.
[46:34.620 --> 46:39.680]  I was going to say, and the reason why I didn't say it is not because it's offensive.
[46:40.160 --> 46:41.620]  It's just I don't think it's true.
[46:41.760 --> 46:45.880]  I was going to say they showed that you could make a good one without them so they could
[46:45.880 --> 46:46.440]  keep going.
[46:46.920 --> 46:49.420]  But I don't think Beverly Hills Cop 3 is a good.
[46:49.840 --> 46:50.700]  It's a bad movie.
[46:51.240 --> 46:53.660]  But it's still your it's still your favorite one.
[46:53.860 --> 46:54.840]  It's not my favorite one.
[46:54.920 --> 46:55.920]  The first is the best.
[46:56.020 --> 46:56.840]  The first is my favorite.
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.420]  The third had the best action.
[46:58.700 --> 47:00.340]  And it was the point that I was making.
[47:01.240 --> 47:03.480]  That is an opinion you've backed yourself into believing.
[47:03.940 --> 47:04.540]  It is.
[47:04.820 --> 47:06.640]  Well, no, it's I believed it.
[47:06.680 --> 47:09.800]  And I don't know how to back out of it, I guess.
[47:10.900 --> 47:13.920]  I will die in the hill that Beverly Hills Cop 3 is the best action.
[47:14.980 --> 47:17.900]  Man, now that we're getting close to the holiday season, Eric mentioned we're going to have
[47:17.900 --> 47:19.300]  a gerbler on the store soon.
[47:19.300 --> 47:20.940]  I got something in the mail yesterday.
[47:21.440 --> 47:24.460]  Amazon is fucking diabolical.
[47:24.800 --> 47:26.100]  What did Amazon do?
[47:26.400 --> 47:27.600]  Have you guys gotten this?
[47:27.700 --> 47:28.420]  Let me send you the text.
[47:29.340 --> 47:29.940]  Discord.
[47:30.440 --> 47:33.080]  Have you guys received in the mail to current resident?
[47:33.240 --> 47:35.620]  By the way, it wasn't to me specifically.
[47:36.320 --> 47:41.860]  They sent me unprompted a kid's Christmas toy catalog.
[47:42.740 --> 47:44.700]  Oh, hell yeah.
[47:44.840 --> 47:48.360]  With like, fill out the toys you want right here.
[47:48.360 --> 47:49.340]  Hell yeah.
[47:49.980 --> 47:51.140]  Circle the ones that are for you.
[47:51.200 --> 47:52.220]  I'm so jealous.
[47:52.760 --> 47:54.140]  Bringing it back, dude.
[47:54.300 --> 47:55.040]  No way.
[47:55.160 --> 47:55.840]  Oh, man.
[47:56.960 --> 47:59.740]  Oh, over 700 toys and gifts.
[48:00.000 --> 48:04.520]  Yeah, including the page that I sent you just happens to have a very similar looking remote
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.500]  control truck to my shark.
[48:07.000 --> 48:07.960]  That's so cool.
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.320]  Did you go through the whole book?
[48:10.700 --> 48:14.340]  I couldn't because Emily took it immediately and went and sat down and went through the
[48:14.340 --> 48:15.160]  whole book herself.
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.000]  Has she decided which Hot Wheels car she's going to get?
[48:18.360 --> 48:18.840]  I'm not.
[48:18.960 --> 48:20.160]  I think she circled some Barbie stuff.
[48:20.260 --> 48:22.960]  No, I just I was I was fucking wild to get that in the mail.
[48:23.040 --> 48:23.860]  I'm like, what is this?
[48:23.900 --> 48:26.700]  And then I went, oh, my God, that's awesome.
[48:26.880 --> 48:28.100]  It's very smart of them.
[48:28.120 --> 48:28.920]  Very devious.
[48:29.180 --> 48:29.600]  It is.
[48:29.680 --> 48:30.700]  It is super devious.
[48:31.140 --> 48:32.740]  All the waste there.
[48:33.420 --> 48:33.900]  Mm hmm.
[48:34.300 --> 48:38.540]  I feel like they fixed the catalog problem by inventing websites.
[48:39.020 --> 48:40.560]  Also, my kid doesn't live at home anymore.
[48:40.620 --> 48:41.560]  She's off to college.
[48:41.740 --> 48:42.040]  So she's.
[48:45.160 --> 48:46.640]  I the waste thing.
[48:47.420 --> 48:49.340]  It's you're right, it is a waste.
[48:49.520 --> 48:52.260]  I fucking hate paper straws.
[48:52.660 --> 48:53.640]  That's what it comes down to.
[48:53.780 --> 48:54.900]  Paper straws are dog shit.
[48:54.980 --> 48:56.740]  It's a terrible replacement for plastic.
[48:56.960 --> 48:57.620]  I agree.
[48:57.760 --> 48:59.900]  I also don't think that these catalogs are a waste.
[49:00.260 --> 49:04.320]  I like my wife definitely got her are no money's worth out of it last night.
[49:04.400 --> 49:05.660]  She spent 45 minutes.
[49:05.880 --> 49:06.980]  I don't think these are a waste at all.
[49:07.020 --> 49:09.400]  You don't think unsolicited mail is a waste?
[49:11.200 --> 49:14.260]  I think unsolicited mail in general is a waste.
[49:14.420 --> 49:15.740]  Do I think this is a waste?
[49:15.740 --> 49:17.140]  No, I don't know.
[49:17.240 --> 49:18.860]  So you think most people will read it?
[49:19.160 --> 49:22.980]  I think that there will be a lot of people that do go through it for the nostalgia kick
[49:22.980 --> 49:24.020]  and kids will go through it.
[49:24.100 --> 49:25.180]  I do not think it is a waste.
[49:25.540 --> 49:29.000]  If it had video games and stuff in it and it's skewed a little older,
[49:29.060 --> 49:32.820]  I would recommend we do it as a piece of supplemental to kind of replace the summer.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.300]  Other than 98 catalog we did.
[49:35.960 --> 49:37.960]  But it stays pretty young.
[49:38.440 --> 49:39.060]  That's too bad.
[49:39.480 --> 49:39.760]  Yeah.
[49:40.900 --> 49:42.360]  Otherwise, I think it'd be fun to do.
[49:42.840 --> 49:44.840]  But it'd be like it'd be like Fisher Price shit.
[49:44.840 --> 49:47.860]  I would love to buy all the toys I couldn't afford as a kid.
[49:48.380 --> 49:48.740]  Yes.
[49:49.400 --> 49:51.400]  The problem is nostalgia is expensive.
[49:52.140 --> 49:54.580]  Is when I've looked at doing that type of thing.
[49:54.860 --> 49:58.480]  Yeah, I think if it was the actual stuff I couldn't afford as a kid,
[49:58.540 --> 50:01.160]  it would I still couldn't get it because it'd be ridiculous.
[50:01.840 --> 50:02.840]  It's so funny you say that.
[50:02.920 --> 50:05.760]  I was thinking the other day that if I had all the money in the world,
[50:06.280 --> 50:08.980]  all I would want to do and I'd have to figure out how to work it out with Emily.
[50:09.700 --> 50:12.980]  All I would want to do is have a like,
[50:13.660 --> 50:18.360]  perfect one to one recreation of Ricky Schroeder's bedroom from Silver Spoons,
[50:18.560 --> 50:20.720]  which is a show is probably a little too old for you guys,
[50:20.760 --> 50:25.660]  but he was rich and he had a race car bed and he had like all the coolest toys.
[50:25.800 --> 50:28.420]  It was kind of like the TV version of that Richard Pryor movie.
[50:29.480 --> 50:33.940]  And it was I would love to sleep in a race car bed for the rest of my life.
[50:34.120 --> 50:35.720]  If I could do it in that bed.
[50:35.720 --> 50:36.240]  Yeah.
[50:38.300 --> 50:39.880]  Oh, it's a pretty cool looking room.
[50:40.660 --> 50:41.060]  Yes.
[50:41.220 --> 50:44.960]  You got the race car bed in the back and it's a race wall behind him.
[50:44.980 --> 50:47.000]  He had a dad who loved him, too, which was wild.
[50:47.160 --> 50:49.880]  It was so fucking there was so much I liked about that show.
[50:52.260 --> 50:55.820]  I for me, when I look at toys now, I have.
[50:56.760 --> 51:00.620]  I have this weird gap of none of the nostalgia stuff
[51:00.620 --> 51:03.940]  is is things that I care about or properties I care about.
[51:03.940 --> 51:06.080]  I don't care about Star Wars.
[51:06.200 --> 51:08.640]  I'm not a big Marvel guy like it's fine.
[51:08.760 --> 51:09.520]  I don't mind Marvel.
[51:09.620 --> 51:10.200]  It's just it's not.
[51:10.340 --> 51:11.760]  I wasn't into that as a kid.
[51:12.360 --> 51:16.460]  I was in this weird time period where I don't feel like there's a big Teenage
[51:16.460 --> 51:17.660]  Mutant Ninja Turtles show on.
[51:17.780 --> 51:21.960]  So that feels like a thing I should love because as an adult, I'm like, that's really cool.
[51:22.040 --> 51:26.040]  I like all the visuals of it, but I just wasn't exposed to it as a kid.
[51:27.080 --> 51:31.900]  Jurassic Park sucks in its current iteration, like all of the like kind of popular kids
[51:31.900 --> 51:37.580]  brands now either don't have nostalgia for or it's a version of it that I don't think is good.
[51:38.240 --> 51:42.960]  I wish it was like, oh, why wasn't Small Soldiers a series that kept going?
[51:43.240 --> 51:44.240]  There should be more of those.
[51:44.760 --> 51:47.260]  I want to buy Gorgonite toys in 2024.
[51:47.780 --> 51:49.100]  That's really sad, Andrew.
[51:49.360 --> 51:53.160]  I feel bad for you, but I also think that they just ruin nostalgia.
[51:53.320 --> 51:57.080]  Like I grew up with Star Wars and I couldn't give a shit about Star Wars anymore.
[51:57.080 --> 52:02.680]  I grew up, I had, I humped 10,000 comic books around with me everywhere I moved until I was like 30.
[52:03.260 --> 52:05.120]  And now you couldn't pay me to read a comic book.
[52:05.220 --> 52:11.920]  All that stuff has been so overdone and just so beaten to death that it's all ruined for me.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.100]  And it makes me not look back at it as well.
[52:15.920 --> 52:17.900]  Like there was a long time I could, I could look back and be like, well,
[52:17.980 --> 52:19.080]  it's still like Empire Strikes Back.
[52:19.200 --> 52:20.340]  I still think it's like the coolest movie.
[52:20.500 --> 52:23.940]  But even now, I just, when I look back on like where I would find nostalgia,
[52:23.940 --> 52:30.180]  I just try to find other TV shows or movies to explore because it's just all been just spoiled
[52:30.180 --> 52:31.440]  with excess.
[52:31.640 --> 52:36.460]  It's also interesting how technology moving forward means that the stuff I would have given
[52:36.460 --> 52:39.440]  a nut for is of absolutely no interest.
[52:39.640 --> 52:43.300]  Like when I was 10, would have freaking loved a Game Boy Camera.
[52:43.520 --> 52:44.340]  Holy shit.
[52:44.480 --> 52:45.480]  Would have loved one.
[52:46.340 --> 52:48.300]  Now I wouldn't pay a dollar for one.
[52:48.700 --> 52:48.900]  Yeah.
[52:49.140 --> 52:49.740]  Will be the point.
[52:51.480 --> 52:54.280]  Is the Game Boy Camera was just photos, right?
[52:54.780 --> 52:55.340]  I think so.
[52:56.060 --> 52:58.360]  On like a 144p screen.
[52:58.700 --> 53:02.200]  It was like a, it was like a, like a fax machine almost.
[53:02.520 --> 53:05.980]  I haven't been able to figure out what it would be, but I think it's really funny.
[53:06.080 --> 53:11.580]  The idea of us trying to use the camera for some supplemental in some form.
[53:12.020 --> 53:15.560]  What if we do a let's play in all of our face cams of the Game Boy Camera?
[53:17.400 --> 53:18.360]  It's really funny.
[53:19.260 --> 53:20.900]  And it's totally, I don't know.
[53:21.380 --> 53:23.160]  Do you have any nostalgia that hasn't been ruined?
[53:23.440 --> 53:26.520]  Or do you still think like, do you still think fondly of it?
[53:26.540 --> 53:28.380]  Even if you don't like connect super strong with it?
[53:28.660 --> 53:31.160]  It's stuff that is like not available now.
[53:31.360 --> 53:37.500]  So I think about like, oh man, if I had money as a child and they were still around,
[53:37.540 --> 53:41.400]  like the Turbo Man dolls, like when they made toys for Jingle all the way.
[53:41.760 --> 53:42.640]  Those were awesome.
[53:43.020 --> 53:47.320]  The small soldiers thing is another one where it's like, oh, that stuff is cool.
[53:47.320 --> 53:49.680]  I go back and I look at the boxes for it.
[53:51.880 --> 53:52.960]  Those are the main ones.
[53:53.280 --> 53:54.580]  Did you read a lot as a kid at all?
[53:54.900 --> 53:55.400]  Not really.
[53:57.080 --> 53:59.780]  More into like when I think of the action figures I collected.
[54:00.420 --> 54:02.920]  And it's weird because I'm not a big Lord of the Rings fan,
[54:02.980 --> 54:06.180]  but I ended up with a lot of Lord of the Rings action figures that were fun.
[54:06.520 --> 54:09.580]  I had the Lost action figures, which were not fun.
[54:09.700 --> 54:12.080]  But like I was, that's how deep I was in the Lost.
[54:13.100 --> 54:14.540]  John Locke looking at the hatch.
[54:14.620 --> 54:16.380]  Remember the magazine for Lost?
[54:16.380 --> 54:19.180]  I was a subscriber to Lost the magazine.
[54:19.900 --> 54:22.900]  I wanted that universe to continue so badly
[54:22.900 --> 54:25.540]  as an expanded universe with novels and stuff.
[54:25.620 --> 54:27.940]  And I just just floundered.
[54:28.260 --> 54:28.680]  It was a shame.
[54:28.820 --> 54:28.940]  I did.
[54:29.260 --> 54:29.940]  There was so much.
[54:30.100 --> 54:32.820]  There was so much intrigue and interest and possibility in there.
[54:32.840 --> 54:35.640]  And it was ultimately didn't really go anywhere, unfortunately.
[54:35.800 --> 54:37.160]  But I was ready for it, man.
[54:37.180 --> 54:38.240]  Like we talked about it in the past,
[54:38.280 --> 54:40.100]  but I loved that video game Viadomus
[54:40.100 --> 54:42.220]  because I just liked seeing different parts of the island
[54:42.220 --> 54:44.440]  and you could see how stuff fit together, you know?
[54:44.440 --> 54:45.860]  Oh, is that a good game?
[54:46.520 --> 54:48.960]  I mean, it was a free roam kind.
[54:49.040 --> 54:50.560]  No, not really.
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.220]  But you could explore the island.
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.640]  You know, we should do a little watch along where we watch you play it.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.240]  It's I have it.
[54:56.580 --> 54:57.540]  We're going to do that.
[54:57.620 --> 54:58.220]  I bought it.
[55:00.260 --> 55:01.320]  We are going.
[55:01.440 --> 55:04.860]  It's so funny, the actors that they got for their actual voices
[55:04.860 --> 55:06.120]  and who they missed out on,
[55:06.780 --> 55:10.900]  because now I think that entire cast, for the most part,
[55:10.960 --> 55:13.340]  they are not big names like they would not be.
[55:13.340 --> 55:14.240]  They're available.
[55:14.560 --> 55:18.180]  But at that time, they were they were out of the price range.
[55:18.260 --> 55:19.720]  So there's no Matthew Fox.
[55:19.820 --> 55:21.220]  There's no Terry O'Quinn.
[55:21.640 --> 55:25.100]  There is it is like Sun is in it.
[55:25.120 --> 55:28.600]  And it's all background kind of side characters.
[55:28.840 --> 55:32.280]  Do you think now they're like, hey, can I can I rerecord lines for that?
[55:32.580 --> 55:33.640]  Oh, absolutely.
[55:35.780 --> 55:39.960]  I speaking of like toys and stuff, nostalgia.
[55:39.960 --> 55:46.160]  I have gone through a kind of odd process of I've been on a rocky kick
[55:46.160 --> 55:49.460]  because I somehow avoided all of those films.
[55:50.740 --> 55:51.620]  Avoid, I guess.
[55:51.680 --> 55:51.920]  I don't know.
[55:51.960 --> 55:53.360]  I wasn't alive for most of them.
[55:53.440 --> 55:57.260]  I remember seeing Rocky Balboa in theaters thinking this is crazy
[55:57.260 --> 56:00.720]  that I'm seeing a Rocky movie with Stallone in a movie theater.
[56:02.500 --> 56:07.680]  I've watched the old ones because they were I got a notification on Prime saying
[56:07.680 --> 56:10.980]  we are going to stop carrying these in like four days.
[56:11.100 --> 56:12.140]  I thought, oh, fuck.
[56:12.160 --> 56:13.420]  I've been meaning to see those.
[56:13.500 --> 56:15.480]  I guess let's just watch them nonstop.
[56:15.820 --> 56:16.980]  I've been in high rocky kick.
[56:17.140 --> 56:19.320]  Watch all of them outside of Rocky five.
[56:19.640 --> 56:20.660]  It has led me.
[56:20.720 --> 56:21.860]  I'm going to share my screen.
[56:22.200 --> 56:25.340]  You guys for a minute because this is an important question.
[56:27.400 --> 56:33.880]  I think that Sylvester Stallone is the greatest sprinting action star of all time.
[56:33.920 --> 56:37.340]  He is the best run I think of any action star.
[56:37.340 --> 56:38.460]  Better than Steven Seagal.
[56:38.940 --> 56:39.740]  Better than Tom Cruise.
[56:39.740 --> 56:41.900]  Better than Tom Cruise.
[56:42.680 --> 56:45.580]  Sylvester Stallone running is one of the most
[56:45.580 --> 56:48.640]  visually impressive things I've seen in an action movie.
[56:48.960 --> 56:50.400]  It is so absurd.
[56:51.080 --> 56:54.200]  The first film gave me this thought of like, wow,
[56:54.640 --> 56:57.960]  there is a scene in the first movie where he is running and he's in shape now
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.980]  and he's like booking it and then he turns it up another gear and that man really hoofs it.
[57:03.440 --> 57:06.300]  And it is solidified to me.
[57:06.300 --> 57:07.420]  Let me find.
[57:08.100 --> 57:08.600]  Here we go.
[57:09.320 --> 57:10.820]  In Rocky three.
[57:11.200 --> 57:11.660]  Oh, yeah.
[57:11.960 --> 57:12.680]  He's running.
[57:13.280 --> 57:14.960]  He's running on the beach.
[57:15.860 --> 57:17.500]  I'll just do I'm hitting play.
[57:17.600 --> 57:18.320]  You guys are all watching.
[57:18.460 --> 57:19.380]  So they're going.
[57:19.920 --> 57:21.040]  They're sprinting.
[57:21.260 --> 57:22.880]  Figuring things out.
[57:23.280 --> 57:24.500]  Look at Carl Lewis.
[57:24.520 --> 57:25.380]  Rest in peace, Carl.
[57:25.440 --> 57:26.580]  Look at Stallone.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.160]  Stallone is going so fast.
[57:29.240 --> 57:33.460]  He looks like he's going to just break down his whole body.
[57:33.880 --> 57:34.500]  Love this.
[57:34.820 --> 57:37.340]  Look at all the sinew in the muscle and everything.
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.580]  So jacked and just running.
[57:40.020 --> 57:40.960]  This is so awesome.
[57:41.120 --> 57:41.720]  Look at the head.
[57:42.220 --> 57:44.100]  This is the head bobbing.
[57:44.360 --> 57:47.160]  He looks like the wheels are about to fall off.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.280]  He's going so fast.
[57:48.420 --> 57:50.080]  His neck can barely take it.
[57:51.700 --> 57:53.420]  These are my heroes.
[57:53.860 --> 57:54.380]  Yay.
[57:55.900 --> 57:57.180]  We ran together.
[57:57.680 --> 57:58.420]  We did it.
[57:58.800 --> 57:59.660]  We ran real far.
[58:00.420 --> 58:00.800]  Yay.
[58:01.640 --> 58:03.440]  It's just going back.
[58:03.760 --> 58:07.440]  It looks like he's in one of those G-Force chairs.
[58:07.820 --> 58:09.480]  Yeah, just look at his face.
[58:09.720 --> 58:10.700]  Look at that.
[58:10.800 --> 58:11.820]  He's just running.
[58:13.140 --> 58:14.480]  It looks like he's going to die.
[58:15.240 --> 58:19.880]  So I'd love to know, do you guys have any actors that you think of like iconic runs?
[58:21.020 --> 58:22.000]  I think we already said them.
[58:22.320 --> 58:24.080]  Well, yeah, it's Rocky 2.
[58:24.860 --> 58:25.640]  Rocky 2?
[58:25.820 --> 58:27.000]  He has a run in Rocky 2?
[58:27.960 --> 58:28.760]  Where he's...
[58:28.760 --> 58:29.480]  I mean, yeah.
[58:30.260 --> 58:31.380]  Oh, the steps?
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.020]  Yeah, with the kids and all that.
[58:35.440 --> 58:36.840]  Where he's doing...
[58:36.840 --> 58:37.880]  It's this?
[58:38.780 --> 58:39.380]  Oh, hold on.
[58:40.160 --> 58:41.500]  Here, I'll just go to this part.
[58:41.640 --> 58:41.780]  Here.
[58:41.960 --> 58:43.240]  Oh, this might be what I was thinking.
[58:43.400 --> 58:45.500]  See, I watch Rocky 1 and 2 back-to-back.
[58:46.120 --> 58:46.840]  Where he kicks it up.
[58:46.940 --> 58:49.920]  He's going, and then everyone's there with him, and then he goes...
[58:49.920 --> 58:51.960]  And then, yes, that is what I was thinking.
[58:52.160 --> 58:54.760]  I thought this was in 1, where he starts poofing it.
[58:55.300 --> 58:57.700]  Yeah, he's just gas, dude.
[58:57.700 --> 58:58.800]  He's just...
[58:58.800 --> 59:00.560]  God, that rocks so hard.
[59:00.780 --> 59:04.020]  The way he just runs that fast is so fucking cool to me.
[59:04.100 --> 59:05.920]  Like, he's just giving it everything.
[59:06.500 --> 59:07.580]  That's so awesome.
[59:07.980 --> 59:08.680]  Look at that shot.
[59:08.780 --> 59:09.360]  Oh, my God.
[59:09.980 --> 59:11.040]  God, it's so awesome.
[59:11.620 --> 59:12.520]  Rocky 2 is awesome.
[59:13.180 --> 59:14.840]  First three are great.
[59:15.360 --> 59:16.100]  First four are great.
[59:16.780 --> 59:22.100]  Should we grab a slow-mo camera and recreate the beast shot with each of us doing it?
[59:22.540 --> 59:22.860]  Please.
[59:23.940 --> 59:26.100]  I want to see a full-on sprint.
[59:26.100 --> 59:28.700]  I promise you, I will throw up.
[59:28.780 --> 59:29.220]  So you got to throw up.
[59:29.220 --> 59:30.100]  I was going to say the same thing.
[59:30.180 --> 59:30.620]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:30.640 --> 59:31.660]  That's a...
[59:31.660 --> 59:33.380]  I mean, yeah, if we want to puke, sure, absolutely.
[59:33.720 --> 59:34.300]  I can give that.
[59:34.540 --> 59:36.760]  I think you'll have to sprint for like 20 seconds.
[59:37.320 --> 59:37.740]  I'll do it.
[59:37.900 --> 59:38.500]  I'll throw up.
[59:41.780 --> 59:44.060]  Nick, you're the most athletic here.
[59:44.120 --> 59:44.900]  We've gone over this.
[59:44.920 --> 59:45.780]  You got the best movement.
[59:45.980 --> 59:47.480]  I'd love to see you full tilt.
[59:47.940 --> 59:49.240]  20 seconds of Nick's sprint.
[59:51.760 --> 59:52.120]  Sure.
[59:52.680 --> 59:53.040]  Hey.
[59:54.820 --> 59:55.740]  So hard to convince.
[59:56.080 --> 59:56.720]  I can't wait.
[59:57.660 --> 59:59.580]  I had to talk to my neighbors a few weeks ago.
[59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.560]  Oh, no.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.940]  That must have been really difficult for you.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:02.420]  Yeah.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.800]  They're like, why are you shaving with a broken beard in our house?
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:13.960]  No, one of my neighbors walked up and said, are you okay?
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.560]  Why do you think that might have been, Eric?
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:19.640]  I don't know.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:24.260]  I just assumed you were in the backyard, like shaving.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.860]  But I, you know, we already kind of hit on that.
[01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:30.380]  I can't think of why else they would ask if you were okay.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.580]  Do you think maybe it would have something to do with the fact that after you gave me a ride home,
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.300]  you drove your car into my legs and I fell into my bins?
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.360]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.220]  What?
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.380]  I forgot about that.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:54.740]  Yeah, I forgot about that.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.540]  You hit Gavin with a car?
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.400]  He just pretended to run me over a little bit.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.500]  And then when I was pinned against the bins, he just kept going.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.620]  I just kind of kept going.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.320]  He's like, oh, you're already pinned.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.260]  And I went, yep.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.400]  And we're going to keep it going.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:08.800]  So it was a pretty good time.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.540]  We're having fun.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:11.880]  A couple of guys hanging out, hitting each other with cars.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:13.800]  I thought it was pretty funny.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:18.460]  It must have looked pretty strange from an external perspective.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.600]  Hey, did your friend just run you over?
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.280]  Are you okay?
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.000]  Yeah, I was about to run these cucumbers over and I saw the strangest thing.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.380]  Oh, man.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.100]  Good times.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:31.980]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:32.760]  That's so funny.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.280]  Did you guys see the pillows that they made for the Nintendo Museum?
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:41.500]  Excuse me?
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:43.420]  Of all the N64 controllers?
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.500]  Yeah, let me let me here.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.860]  We post a photo of...
[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.620]  Also, before we wrap up, should we talk about how fucking stupid we all are?
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.140]  What?
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:52.460]  What?
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:58.060]  Well, a certain tech support situation we got ourselves into before this podcast.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.200]  Oh, yeah, we do that.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:00.700]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:06.360]  See, Geoff, they made this, the N64, and then they did a Wiimote one.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:07.500]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:09.580]  Look at how dumb these fucking...
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:13.480]  They're giant controllers that are pillows.
[01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.020]  It made me think if you could turn anything in your house, any item into a pillow,
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.660]  what would you want it to be?
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.940]  What would you want as a pillow?
[01:02:22.540 --> 01:02:22.940]  Oh.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.020]  Uh, Dutch oven.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.100]  Like, crawl into it. Be all cozy.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.280]  Maybe I'm nuts. Have we not talked about this before?
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.380]  Sliced spaghetti is what we were talking about before.
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:37.820]  Okay.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.160]  Yeah, I think it would be something that could be completely enclosed and I could get on the inside
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.460]  of. I think an oven's great.
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.620]  Oven is a really good one.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.320]  What about a fridge?
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.800]  It's upright, isn't it?
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.060]  A car would be good.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:52.560]  Coffin?
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:54.540]  A car pillow?
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.940]  Maybe a nice big recycling bin pillow.
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.440]  How about a toilet?
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:04.800]  Could you... could you sit on it without it collapsing in or...
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.620]  No, there's no way.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.640]  No, no.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.300]  I think I would go with, like, a Gerpler.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.080]  I think I would go with a coffin.
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.860]  Oh my god.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.620]  Because that would be the most confus...
[01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:18.940]  Imagine that it's not like, like, the middle isn't stuffed.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.500]  It's just a pillow in the shape fully of, like, a cup.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.220]  So it could potentially hold stuff.
[01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:28.980]  But it's just a... it's just a cup pillow.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:30.640]  I think a knife would be cool.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:31.940]  You throw it at people and they'd be like...
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.700]  I want the, is it cake trend but it's pillows.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:41.640]  I think the toilet is dangerous, though, because I wouldn't want something that I could accidentally
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.240]  shit in if I wasn't paying attention.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.280]  You wake up tired and go for a piss.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.920]  I mean, if you're Geoff, that's most things, right?
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:50.440]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.820]  Like, did you ever do a thing as a kid where you piss in a bin or something?
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.800]  Because you just, like, you're out of it.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:55.440]  Yeah.
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:56.260]  Yeah.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:59.560]  I've pissed on a toilet seat that had the lid on it before.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.500]  I threw up on one of those.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:09.100]  I once pissed on a toilet that not only had the lid down on it, I had my iPad on top.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.660]  It was disastrous.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.280]  That was an all-time bad one.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.300]  You pissed on your iPad?
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.680]  Yeah, it was the middle of the night and I was really groggy and I walked into the bathroom.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.880]  I started peeing and I could tell immediately.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:31.720]  And I went down to quickly lift the lid and then I felt the tablet.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.420]  And it was just bad.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.720]  So did you even lift up the iPad or did you just piss right on it?
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.320]  No, I pissed on the, it was face down, so I pissed on the metal back of the iPad
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.940]  and then it splattered and the seat was down.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.260]  I just thought it was the seat was up.
[01:04:47.420 --> 01:04:51.240]  Who would have thought that you would have reclaimed piss boy from me in the same episode
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.840]  that I took it?
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:55.740]  Yeah, really, really crazy, dude. Way to go, Andrew.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.060]  Fascinating to watch the piss baton change hands like that.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.980]  Here's a question for you.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.680]  Do you think storing stuff on the toilet is maybe a bad idea?
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.460]  I think, well, listen, there are negatives to it for sure.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.600]  I think I was in, I think I had a bath and I was probably using the tablet in the bath
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:21.300]  then put it on the toilet seat when I got out of the bath and then just left it there.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:24.200]  He, you just, there's negatives for sure.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.020]  No mention of any positives whatsoever.
[01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.000]  Just I put it, I had to put it somewhere.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.300]  The positive is that it's a close surface.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.480]  It is a, it's always within reach generally.
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.200]  But there's poo and you touch the iPad with your fingers and there's poo there.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.780]  It's going to be the grossest iPad.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.080]  That's piss on the back of it.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.460]  No, it's the lid, the seat, this, the top of it.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.760]  There's piss on the front of it now too.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.240]  Yeah, we talk about it.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:54.340]  The part that the, so you put a lid down on a toilet and then there's an upper part of it
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.920]  that is completely uninvolved in anything.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.440]  The, like the tank, the cistern.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.580]  Yeah, like, well, there's a lid.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:04.660]  Oh, you're talking about the bit where you used to keep your headphones.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:05.420]  No.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.360]  With all the toilet paper crust.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.720]  Okay, so it's ceramic bowl.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.020]  Then there's seat.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.560]  Then there's lid.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.940]  And the lid has a top and a bottom.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.920]  The bottom is facing water.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.340]  That's the danger zone.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.280]  The top is fine.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.320]  The top is...
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.980]  Where's the top getting hit?
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:32.980]  Well, when the top's open and you flush the toilet and all the, like, fecal particles go flying.
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.880]  No, you close the lid.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.200]  So you only flush a closed toilet?
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.880]  Yeah, isn't that the point?
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.360]  I mean, I think a lot of people flush with it open.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.380]  Yeah.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:43.840]  I'm not a lot of people.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.460]  I'm not worried about what a lot of people are doing.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.120]  I close the lid and I flush.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:00.880]  I would maybe argue that I make more of an effort to keep that upper area secure as somebody who
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:02.900]  places an iPad on it.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:04.500]  Also, like, phone.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:05.380]  What about your phone?
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.720]  You're spitting into your phone.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:08.540]  You're touching it with your hand.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.380]  Putting my phone in my butt.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.940]  All this shit is gross.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.740]  No, my point is all this shit is gross.
[01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.800]  What are you getting down to it?
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.260]  It's all disgusting.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.140]  He's not wrong.
[01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.140]  When you're wiping your ass, right?
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.120]  The seat's up.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:25.860]  There's bits of poo and tiny poo particles going all over the place.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:27.720]  And it's getting on the seat.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.340]  You know what, though, Gavin?
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.660]  You're guilty to defend Andrew a little bit here.
[01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.360]  You're guilty of doing one of the grossest things that I think a human can do.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.580]  I don't know if you still do it, but you used to do it all the time.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.260]  And it drove me crazy.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.540]  You run around with untied shoelaces.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.160]  Those shoelaces just flop around on the ground.
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.900]  They would get stepped on.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.760]  In the past, you have.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:54.260]  I've seen you walk around with untied shoelaces tons in your old Converse back in the day.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.720]  Like, if I'm just like...
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.240]  I wouldn't leave the house with untied shoelaces.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:00.000]  I've seen it.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:00.740]  I've seen it at RT.
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.480]  And that's extra icky.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:03.960]  No, that's gross.
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:04.960]  Because then you got to touch them.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:05.560]  I wouldn't.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.080]  And they touch the ground and the ground is where poop and pee is.
[01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:11.080]  Look at who is the gross guy.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.920]  How the tables have turned.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.380]  I haven't had shoelaces for like 10 years.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.280]  I'm just saying.
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.160]  My cats eat them, so I had to go with elastic.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:23.660]  Let's see.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.440]  The tablet is the worst thing I've pissed on, though.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:26.300]  By far.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:27.980]  Most regrettable.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.300]  Did you save it?
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:30.280]  Or was that it?
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:31.100]  No, it was fine.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:31.540]  It was fine.
[01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:33.480]  Wash it off.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:36.840]  All good.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:39.040]  Never dropped a phone in the toilet.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.080]  It's been close.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.480]  You don't need to when you piss all over it outside.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.420]  Hey, you're right.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.000]  Right about that.
[01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:50.740]  Wow, this is a lot of fun.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.240]  Just wrap up.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:53.660]  We're done.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.440]  This is over.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.040]  We did it.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.460]  It's over.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.460]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:59.340]  At some point in there, we had an episode.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.700]  It was probably pretty good.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:01.440]  Maybe it wasn't.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:01.920]  I don't know.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:08.800]  I will say that we spent 49 minutes trying to troubleshoot a problem on Eric's computer today
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.380]  that was related to us being able to hear something that we shouldn't have been able to hear.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:16.900]  Okay, so when you say it like that, that's fucking crazy.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:21.900]  Instead of saying we could hear ourselves because we were watching his screen through Discord,
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:26.840]  instead of saying it like you listen to porn on my computer somehow.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.400]  You set that up in such a weird way.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.900]  You set that up in so nefarious
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.400]  What's wrong with you?
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.060]  There was nothing nefarious about it.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.200]  It was absolutely nefarious.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:39.760]  I don't think Gavin, did that sound nefarious to you?
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:42.000]  What?
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.320]  What was that?
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.100]  Where did Gavin go?
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:48.280]  Did we lose Gavin?
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.460]  That might be it.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.580]  What a time to throw to Gavin.
[01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:55.120]  Anyway, the point is we're all extra fucking dumb.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.660]  That wasn't what my note in my phone was about.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.200]  I still don't know why I'm real dumb.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.760]  But one of the reasons we're all real dumb is because we were trying to
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:09.540]  troubleshoot a problem that we were creating in the process of troubleshooting it.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.240]  And so real stupid, real stupid bunch of dummies.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.860]  So if you're a Roadcaster Duo expert, let me know.
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.000]  Thanks for listening, guys.

[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.140]  Check out everything we got going on right now.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:32.540]  And check out the Gerpler on sale probably in like late November.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.720]  Gerple Friday.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.400]  Gerp Friday.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.540]  Why don't we announce it in the store?
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.580]  Where the fuck have you been?
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:40.380]  Yeah, what the fuck are you talking about?
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:43.300]  We've been like trying to throw to you and you've just like nothing.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.840]  Oh yeah, I had to piss.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.600]  Sometimes I go for a quick...
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.100]  On an iPad?
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.620]  I didn't piss on the iPad.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.680]  But chances are if I sit down to piss, because that's how I do it,
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.920]  someone will say my name and then I gotta yell.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:56.260]  Wow.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.260]  Good work.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.660]  How many times have you pissed without us noticing throughout the history of this show?
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.160]  Probably nine.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.460]  I don't think I've ever done it.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.160]  That's insane.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.620]  Have you? Has anybody else done that?
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.380]  No.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.680]  It's mainly because while we were troubleshooting Eric's thing for no reason earlier,
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.900]  I just kept drinking.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:20.920]  So I think it's really exciting that Gavin got the piss boy thing at the very beginning,
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.240]  handed back the baton to Andrew,
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.120]  and then we're ending it with piss rat Gavin.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.240]  Thank you guys so much for listening to the podcast.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.060]  We will see you next time.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:28.680]  Have a good one.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:29.040]  Bye!
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:32.000]  Wait, I can open my connection doctor on my email.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.140]  Let's get a doctor in on this.
