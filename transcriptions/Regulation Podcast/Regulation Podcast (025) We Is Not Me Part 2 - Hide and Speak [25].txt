[00:00.000 --> 00:03.920]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.440 --> 00:06.840]  This is episode 025.
[00:07.280 --> 00:11.000]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton, Gavin
[00:11.000 --> 00:14.680]  Free, Eric Baudour, in no particular order. Hello.
[00:15.180 --> 00:16.060]  Hello. Hello.
[00:16.780 --> 00:19.680]  How's everybody been in the last three minutes? Great.
[00:20.480 --> 00:24.200]  How are you in the last three minutes? Good. Good. I got a,
[00:24.320 --> 00:28.180]  I had a burp and I accidentally swallowed it and now it's just kind of in there
[00:28.180 --> 00:30.820]  and I don't know if it's going to come out or if it's, you know,
[00:30.820 --> 00:32.580]  that's like the saddest thing you can do.
[00:32.980 --> 00:36.540]  Do you want to sit on my lap and I'll pat your back? Careful.
[00:36.580 --> 00:38.800]  There's probably shit on it. If we didn't,
[00:39.940 --> 00:43.680]  if we can, if we can film it and release it on Patreon, absolutely.
[00:44.000 --> 00:47.540]  Because boy, we make a killing. Why would shit be on my lap?
[00:48.760 --> 00:49.120]  Well,
[00:49.460 --> 00:52.620]  weren't we going to do something in Achievement Hunter a hundred years ago
[00:52.620 --> 00:57.000]  where I sat in your lap and shit on you? Do you remember that? Yes.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.820]  Yeah. I can't remember what the, the qualifier was for doing that. Yeah.
[01:01.200 --> 01:04.960]  But you wanted to just sit on my lap, fully clothed and take a dump.
[01:07.680 --> 01:11.580]  Well, for the record, I no longer have that desire.
[01:11.840 --> 01:15.600]  Oh good. Cause I'm not looking to do that in 2024.
[01:15.900 --> 01:17.540]  Not sure why I wanted to back then.
[01:20.680 --> 01:22.160]  I'm excited to hear Gavin's notes,
[01:22.280 --> 01:25.040]  cause Gavin earlier in the week said he's pretty excited about his notes.
[01:25.420 --> 01:26.460]  I don't think you want to hear my notes.
[01:26.460 --> 01:30.640]  Cause one of my notes is Andrew is an idiot. No, listen, that's every week.
[01:32.000 --> 01:33.360]  Do you got any notes this week, Andrew?
[01:33.760 --> 01:35.900]  Oh, I got so many notes. I got a few myself.
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.180]  I got I was in the lab.
[01:37.240 --> 01:39.840]  I came up with some supplemental ideas I want to pitch to you guys today.
[01:39.840 --> 01:41.120]  But let's start. Let's start with Gavin.
[01:41.260 --> 01:42.180]  Why is Andrew an idiot?
[01:42.580 --> 01:44.920]  Oh, let me prepare some screen shots.
[01:45.940 --> 01:47.800]  Oh, fuck. He brought visual aids.
[01:48.220 --> 01:50.660]  Yeah. He doesn't need proof for this trial.
[01:50.900 --> 01:52.240]  It's made the ruling.
[01:53.900 --> 01:58.360]  We put out, we put out a little supplemental called tuned up.
[01:58.720 --> 02:01.720]  Yeah, a lovely video. Oh, Andrew.
[02:02.720 --> 02:05.160]  Want to make his little conversation from the slack.
[02:05.600 --> 02:08.700]  I you know what? This is I feel unwarranted.
[02:08.960 --> 02:11.780]  Now, can we now I see what you're doing here.
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.520]  Is there a way that we can get a dramatic reenactment like Geoff?
[02:15.860 --> 02:17.020]  Nick, you can be Nick.
[02:17.540 --> 02:21.080]  I'll be I'll be Andrew if you want to be Gavin, Geoff.
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.240]  I'll be Gavin. Yeah.
[02:22.300 --> 02:24.040]  OK. Oh, yeah. OK. All right.
[02:24.860 --> 02:27.660]  OK. I'm also going to have to paste.
[02:28.060 --> 02:29.900]  Yeah, go ahead. I'm ready with the second page.
[02:30.140 --> 02:31.080]  OK. All right.
[02:32.280 --> 02:35.140]  Any preference on game footage I should use for tuned up?
[02:35.480 --> 02:38.580]  Nope. I get tuned up a visual thing.
[02:39.020 --> 02:40.280]  The recording of the website.
[02:40.620 --> 02:42.120]  Can we get another quick second read on that?
[02:42.560 --> 02:48.240]  OK. Is it tuned up a visual thing?
[02:48.420 --> 02:49.820]  Oh, that's way closer. That's way better.
[02:50.440 --> 02:51.960]  Yeah. Sorry. One more.
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.740]  Could we just get just a slightly clearer, maybe?
[02:54.640 --> 02:55.120]  OK.
[03:01.100 --> 03:03.880]  Is it tuned up a visual thing?
[03:04.220 --> 03:05.820]  The recording of the website.
[03:06.420 --> 03:07.120]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[03:07.340 --> 03:07.980]  Yeah, that was good.
[03:08.260 --> 03:10.700]  Not the first. The next two are.
[03:11.120 --> 03:13.400]  How would people know what we're reacting to?
[03:13.700 --> 03:15.460]  Sometimes we just went, oh,
[03:15.460 --> 03:20.000]  yeah, I believe I articulated updates.
[03:20.280 --> 03:22.960]  Every guess. Mm hmm.
[03:23.060 --> 03:26.800]  I definitely was mindful of it not being visual,
[03:27.180 --> 03:29.660]  but I'm sure I wasn't perfect in that.
[03:29.920 --> 03:33.000]  Or you could make those quizzes and just take the screenshots.
[03:33.140 --> 03:34.120]  I try, guys.
[03:34.480 --> 03:38.480]  Wait, did you read that? OK.
[03:40.580 --> 03:43.780]  It's an extra medium and up only release.
[03:43.780 --> 03:48.580]  So I assume the vast majority of people who consume it will be via audio.
[03:48.580 --> 03:54.040]  OK. Now, what I'm referring to is that a lot of the time
[03:54.040 --> 03:56.220]  we would put in a guess for the for the band or whatever,
[03:56.380 --> 03:58.600]  and it would just throw back a bunch of results.
[03:58.820 --> 04:00.120]  And we'd be talking about the results.
[04:00.180 --> 04:01.620]  We like, oh, you know, reacting to it.
[04:02.020 --> 04:03.760]  But at that point, Andrew had argued his point.
[04:04.180 --> 04:06.680]  And I said, being done with discussing it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:08.120]  OK. Uh-huh.
[04:08.600 --> 04:09.780]  Andrew then wrote this.
[04:10.920 --> 04:13.000]  I haven't listened back to it,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.420]  but it certainly works as an audible.
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.300]  That's the primary way.
[04:19.600 --> 04:21.260]  I haven't listened to it.
[04:21.920 --> 04:23.540]  I never listen to anything that we do.
[04:23.640 --> 04:25.960]  Right. Well, I listen to it.
[04:26.140 --> 04:29.680]  I'm doing, you know, maybe we should have the video.
[04:29.940 --> 04:32.900]  And I get that we didn't record it. Right.
[04:33.160 --> 04:36.960]  But what we could have done, and that was because you you'd never like it when I
[04:36.960 --> 04:40.780]  when I say we should have done this and there's no there's no like alternate thing.
[04:40.780 --> 04:43.460]  So I even suggested I'll just type him in.
[04:43.540 --> 04:45.640]  I'll take some screenshots of the exact results.
[04:45.820 --> 04:46.880]  You don't have to type in the same way.
[04:46.940 --> 04:47.940]  You didn't say that. What?
[04:48.060 --> 04:53.400]  You said we you said we could we know there is no moment of you saying
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.780]  I could do this if you said I could do this.
[04:55.880 --> 04:57.300]  I would say absolutely go ahead.
[04:57.820 --> 04:59.520]  I just met us as a company.
[04:59.680 --> 05:05.140]  Well, you said if you meant we never refers to if it's just just go do it.
[05:05.240 --> 05:07.020]  Just go do it if you think it's a good idea to do.
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.200]  It's not it's it's not just go do it because it's that it's like, you know,
[05:13.280 --> 05:15.000]  will the personality have enough time to put it in?
[05:15.060 --> 05:16.200]  I want to just do it for no reason.
[05:16.380 --> 05:18.200]  And you said no.
[05:18.780 --> 05:19.960]  Yeah, I didn't say no.
[05:21.000 --> 05:22.340]  I never said no.
[05:22.940 --> 05:24.780]  What did you mean by it's extra medium only?
[05:24.860 --> 05:27.440]  So I assume the vast majority of people who consume it will be via audio.
[05:27.580 --> 05:30.680]  I was giving a point as to why it may not be a big deal.
[05:30.740 --> 05:32.240]  I never said no, don't do that.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.700]  OK, well, either way, I was putting up a suggestion, a solution to the problem.
[05:37.020 --> 05:39.300]  Where we could basically refilm it.
[05:40.420 --> 05:43.200]  But and then what was the response to the video?
[05:44.180 --> 05:47.400]  There was a lot of all the visual things where it should have been a visual.
[05:47.820 --> 05:49.920]  I've got a series of issues with this.
[05:50.200 --> 05:53.680]  First of all, I already admitted to Gavin he was right.
[05:54.160 --> 05:58.020]  Literally the day it happened and he did not acknowledge it like a little weasel.
[05:58.260 --> 06:00.580]  He just screenshotted all these things.
[06:00.980 --> 06:04.900]  Zero acknowledgment to my comment that he was already right.
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.860]  How does that make me a weasel?
[06:07.260 --> 06:09.340]  This this stuff was already screenshotted.
[06:09.620 --> 06:11.460]  That's a little weasel move.
[06:11.540 --> 06:16.000]  Not reacting, but taking your little screenshots for your bit on the podcast.
[06:16.240 --> 06:17.400]  I'm reacting right here.
[06:17.460 --> 06:18.880]  I'm saving it for the recording.
[06:19.260 --> 06:23.040]  Second of all, I'm not the one who's editing that.
[06:23.520 --> 06:26.580]  This is a public channel, Nick or whoever.
[06:27.180 --> 06:28.740]  Could anybody else?
[06:28.960 --> 06:29.200]  That's true.
[06:29.540 --> 06:31.360]  I never said no.
[06:31.560 --> 06:32.960]  This isn't about me.
[06:32.960 --> 06:36.820]  I gave an opinion and nobody else replied.
[06:37.240 --> 06:37.980]  This is not me.
[06:38.140 --> 06:40.620]  Each of your responses was saying we didn't need it.
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.980]  I was just saying that I don't because you did this what the day before
[06:45.980 --> 06:47.020]  it was supposed to come out.
[06:47.260 --> 06:52.540]  And I was just articulating a point as to why I felt it wasn't necessary.
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.320]  But I never said no.
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.340]  And just because I think something is necessary in the same way that to you,
[06:58.660 --> 07:01.560]  we means also me and anyone can do it.
[07:01.560 --> 07:02.760]  Me vocalizing.
[07:02.940 --> 07:04.060]  I don't think it's necessary.
[07:04.140 --> 07:05.660]  Is it me saying it shouldn't happen?
[07:05.960 --> 07:07.600]  I'm just giving my perspective.
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.620]  I just feel like every response you have said, don't worry about it.
[07:11.120 --> 07:13.140]  I'm not going to, you know, if you feel like.
[07:14.260 --> 07:15.500]  But that's just me.
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.940]  There's five of us.
[07:17.100 --> 07:19.320]  What are the what are the people who read it and didn't reply?
[07:19.420 --> 07:20.880]  Just because I'm the only one who replied.
[07:20.960 --> 07:23.180]  I feel like your issue should be with the three other people.
[07:23.680 --> 07:26.220]  Oh, yeah. Get fucking real.
[07:26.340 --> 07:28.700]  I think the three other people were trying to stay out of this fight.
[07:28.700 --> 07:30.060]  A hundred percent.
[07:30.740 --> 07:31.420]  Zero fight.
[07:32.060 --> 07:34.620]  No. But Geoff, you were in the recording.
[07:34.700 --> 07:35.820]  What did you think? Did you have an opinion?
[07:36.380 --> 07:38.500]  We did it so long ago, I couldn't remember.
[07:38.940 --> 07:41.400]  I was out of town when you had this argument.
[07:41.520 --> 07:42.360]  So I was on vacation.
[07:43.440 --> 07:44.300]  And it wasn't an argument.
[07:45.020 --> 07:46.040]  It seemed like an argument.
[07:46.380 --> 07:47.540]  It wasn't an argument.
[07:48.560 --> 07:49.420]  Eric had it.
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.040]  Eric and Nick, how did you guys take it?
[07:51.180 --> 07:52.200]  I vote it was an argument.
[07:52.680 --> 07:53.480]  Yeah, absolutely.
[07:53.700 --> 07:55.200]  I never viewed it as an argument.
[07:55.600 --> 07:56.560]  That sounds like three votes.
[07:56.740 --> 07:57.480]  It felt like one.
[07:57.480 --> 08:02.280]  That the three vote system doesn't work in that context.
[08:04.160 --> 08:05.980]  I only care about Gavin's vote.
[08:06.040 --> 08:07.300]  Gavin, did you think we were arguing?
[08:07.840 --> 08:10.980]  No, I just thought we were having a discussion about the video.
[08:11.100 --> 08:13.780]  I just thought we're talking back and forth about like what that was.
[08:14.360 --> 08:18.900]  But usually I don't chime in unless I feel like something's going to be missing.
[08:19.180 --> 08:22.880]  Usually you don't chime in unless the shirt just came out or it's about to come out.
[08:23.100 --> 08:24.960]  And it's too late to do anything about it.
[08:24.960 --> 08:28.200]  I chimed in before the shirt came out and when it was about to come out.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.440]  Maybe I should chime in less.
[08:30.740 --> 08:31.860]  Right. No, no, no.
[08:32.000 --> 08:32.840]  Chime in is good.
[08:33.560 --> 08:37.520]  OK, I think your timing maybe just needs some work, but that's it.
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.740]  I will say it is nice to be on the outside of we is not me part two
[08:42.740 --> 08:45.520]  and seeing just sort of like, that's pretty great.
[08:45.800 --> 08:47.700]  It's not it's not just me.
[08:47.780 --> 08:50.920]  I wrote we because if Andrew was like, oh, yeah, let's do it.
[08:50.920 --> 08:51.900]  I would have just done it.
[08:51.900 --> 08:56.500]  I will say when we this did just happen a couple of days ago
[08:56.500 --> 09:00.160]  where we had a video that we recorded for the quiet place
[09:01.060 --> 09:03.560]  and Andrew's footage died and he mentioned it.
[09:03.640 --> 09:05.500]  And then Gavin was like, let's rerecord it.
[09:05.540 --> 09:07.440]  And we all jumped in. We're like, let's rerecord it.
[09:07.460 --> 09:09.200]  I'm ready to fucking go right now. Yeah.
[09:09.420 --> 09:12.860]  So I feel like we've take we've learned from the from the first incident
[09:12.860 --> 09:16.380]  and we've already applied that to the to the following incidents.
[09:16.380 --> 09:19.020]  And it seems like we're on the right track going forward. Yeah.
[09:21.300 --> 09:26.420]  I agree. I just don't see how I'm an idiot in this scenario.
[09:27.020 --> 09:30.400]  I was fully on board to be I'm the fool.
[09:30.620 --> 09:31.740]  I don't think I'm an idiot here.
[09:32.300 --> 09:34.060]  Wait, you're a fool, but not an idiot.
[09:34.260 --> 09:36.240]  No, I'm a general fool.
[09:36.380 --> 09:40.160]  But I don't think what I did in this instance is an example of that.
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.000]  He's a general fool, but not a specific idiot.
[09:43.300 --> 09:46.140]  Yes. Terry Bradshaw said I may be stupid, but I'm not dumb.
[09:46.440 --> 09:47.540]  Exactly. Yeah.
[09:47.540 --> 09:51.440]  I was mainly fine with with the discussion.
[09:51.580 --> 09:53.960]  I just like at the end, you're like, I haven't listened to it, though.
[09:54.620 --> 09:56.240]  Oh, I never listened to any of it.
[09:56.940 --> 09:59.380]  The first thing I listened to was that quiet place thing
[09:59.380 --> 10:01.460]  because I was trying to sink it.
[10:01.820 --> 10:04.080]  I'll just say there's a lot of chiming in for someone who hasn't listened.
[10:11.720 --> 10:13.220]  Definitely feels like a fight to me.
[10:13.400 --> 10:15.100]  That's what I'm saying. Not a fight.
[10:15.240 --> 10:16.480]  I was just trying to be helpful.
[10:16.880 --> 10:19.440]  Next time, if I haven't listened, I will not reply,
[10:19.440 --> 10:21.700]  which means I will not reply to whatever the thing is.
[10:21.840 --> 10:22.820]  Well, that's not helpful.
[10:23.360 --> 10:27.580]  No, if you're a member, you're driving him away, Gavin.
[10:29.200 --> 10:31.340]  Well, if listening is a prerequisite,
[10:32.240 --> 10:34.260]  Andrew, would you feel better if Gavin apologized?
[10:34.620 --> 10:36.760]  No, I don't. I'm sorry.
[10:36.840 --> 10:38.860]  I shouldn't have written my note as Andrew's an idiot.
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.000]  But I did want to bring up this frustrating interaction.
[10:44.160 --> 10:46.500]  Maybe the note should have been I'm frustrated.
[10:49.620 --> 10:52.080]  Those would be my only notes for this show.
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.660]  My note would be weasel move.
[10:57.120 --> 11:00.160]  Now, is the British weasel related to the British jackal?
[11:00.340 --> 11:01.140]  I don't think so.
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.400]  I don't see how it was weasel.
[11:03.540 --> 11:07.580]  I because you didn't ignore the fact that you had this lined up.
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.880]  You're at it. It was content.
[11:09.120 --> 11:10.100]  I knew it was going to be content.
[11:10.260 --> 11:13.880]  And then if I reacted and blew my reaction in the slack, it's not as good.
[11:14.040 --> 11:16.020]  I wanted to give it to you right here.
[11:16.020 --> 11:19.820]  A little ha, a little, little, just any, any form of interaction,
[11:20.080 --> 11:22.720]  because I said all that and I was like, I guess Gavin just didn't.
[11:22.840 --> 11:24.140]  Whatever. OK, weird.
[11:24.860 --> 11:26.460]  Zero response from Gavin on that.
[11:27.780 --> 11:29.860]  I don't know if that was weasel either.
[11:30.760 --> 11:35.400]  The fact that you avoided it for to attempt to blindside me on the show
[11:35.400 --> 11:36.420]  with Andrew's an idiot.
[11:36.600 --> 11:39.180]  We save stuff all the time for the podcast, don't we?
[11:39.220 --> 11:41.820]  Yeah, but the fact that it was Andrew's an idiot and I approached you
[11:41.820 --> 11:43.800]  waving the idiot flag.
[11:43.800 --> 11:44.500]  That's true.
[11:46.800 --> 11:47.400]  That's true.
[11:47.500 --> 11:50.640]  I came to you with the idiot flag and you didn't acknowledge it.
[11:50.760 --> 11:52.520]  And then we're quiet for a few days.
[11:52.620 --> 11:54.700]  And then you open with, I got a note.
[11:54.780 --> 11:55.540]  Andrew's an idiot.
[11:55.740 --> 11:58.740]  Hey, Andrew, remember that time you waved your idiot flag
[11:58.740 --> 12:01.260]  and I didn't acknowledge it? Let's talk about it.
[12:01.620 --> 12:01.960]  That's true.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.220]  Andrew did say to me in a in a private message.
[12:05.240 --> 12:07.020]  Where's the screenshot of that?
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.320]  Every single comment of the video version of Chewed Up
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.900]  people wanting the perspective.
[12:13.740 --> 12:16.080]  It's an army of you being right.
[12:17.280 --> 12:19.340]  I immediately conceded.
[12:19.480 --> 12:22.200]  I feel like we need to make an idiot flag
[12:22.200 --> 12:24.560]  and then somebody has to have it at all times
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.000]  and they have to have it behind them when we record.
[12:27.220 --> 12:28.800]  And then it gets granted to the new idiot.
[12:29.340 --> 12:32.180]  Yeah, it's like the reverse Tower of Pimps from Achievement Hunter.
[12:32.840 --> 12:35.620]  It's going to suck to spend $40 every time you have to give it to Andrew.
[12:37.020 --> 12:38.660]  No, it's just staying with me.
[12:38.840 --> 12:39.580]  It's not going anywhere.
[12:39.580 --> 12:40.780]  Permanently, I think.
[12:40.920 --> 12:42.060]  Yeah, you know what, Andrew?
[12:42.120 --> 12:43.600]  You immediately admitted it to me.
[12:43.700 --> 12:45.880]  I didn't I didn't and seen the comments yet.
[12:45.980 --> 12:49.940]  So I appreciate how you are ready to be wrong in my face.
[12:50.980 --> 12:51.380]  What?
[12:54.380 --> 12:56.940]  I listen, I'll be wrong in your face any day of the week.
[12:57.140 --> 12:58.860]  So a lot of people would have kept quiet.
[12:58.860 --> 12:59.860]  And I appreciate you.
[13:00.040 --> 13:03.760]  Yeah, listen, I saw it and I knew I figured you might not see it.
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.940]  So I went through the effort of making sure you knew, hey, this opinion
[13:07.940 --> 13:09.820]  I had turned out was wrong.
[13:09.980 --> 13:10.880]  It was the wrong opinion.
[13:11.200 --> 13:11.860]  You're right.
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.360]  Oh, but the next ones will have a video component.
[13:17.700 --> 13:21.540]  Yeah. Although I deleted all my OBS settings in which I did that.
[13:21.680 --> 13:22.740]  Or wait, no, Nick.
[13:23.020 --> 13:24.420]  Nick, you were there, so I didn't need to.
[13:24.540 --> 13:25.300]  Never mind. It's fine.
[13:25.680 --> 13:25.840]  What?
[13:26.700 --> 13:27.540]  We're all good.
[13:30.380 --> 13:31.680]  I'm pretty sure you have it.
[13:31.700 --> 13:33.360]  If not, it's uploaded and it's fine.
[13:33.460 --> 13:34.000]  It doesn't matter.
[13:34.200 --> 13:34.960]  It's in the past.
[13:35.700 --> 13:36.920]  We recorded a lot of stuff.
[13:36.920 --> 13:38.860]  Are you saying you deleted all your recordings?
[13:39.540 --> 13:45.100]  No, I threw out all my OBS settings that I was using to capture my desktop.
[13:45.600 --> 13:47.020]  But didn't you already capture the next two?
[13:47.400 --> 13:49.180]  Yes. I captured one.
[13:49.260 --> 13:50.200]  He did the other. Yes.
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.260]  So you...
[13:51.260 --> 13:55.240]  But I was referencing, I said, going forward, they will all be recorded.
[13:55.540 --> 13:59.040]  And then I said, although I just deleted all my OBS settings.
[13:59.560 --> 14:00.580]  Oh, I see.
[14:00.700 --> 14:04.080]  It's a bit circuitous to get there, but I understand what you're saying now.
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.980]  I understood immediately.
[14:05.980 --> 14:07.140]  We're not recording now.
[14:07.400 --> 14:09.020]  You still have time to set it up again.
[14:09.300 --> 14:10.680]  Do you know what the words mean?
[14:10.760 --> 14:11.400]  Going forward?
[14:12.460 --> 14:15.180]  You said going forward, but I just deleted everything.
[14:15.560 --> 14:19.160]  Yeah. Meaning that I will have to figure that out
[14:19.160 --> 14:21.100]  before that is a thing that happens.
[14:21.420 --> 14:23.040]  That doesn't affect the going forward.
[14:23.120 --> 14:23.820]  There'll be video, though.
[14:24.820 --> 14:29.280]  If I if I if I don't have any of the settings in which I recorded the video,
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.100]  how am I going to record the video?
[14:31.340 --> 14:32.420]  Because we'll set all that up.
[14:32.540 --> 14:33.640]  We're not recording right now.
[14:33.640 --> 14:34.940]  I set it up now.
[14:36.720 --> 14:39.800]  OK. It was just a throwaway point is more.
[14:40.180 --> 14:42.560]  I was just trying to make a little joke about how I had to delete
[14:42.560 --> 14:45.580]  all that coincidentally today for a different thing.
[14:46.940 --> 14:47.760]  Oh, my God.
[14:47.940 --> 14:49.280]  I now I'm annoyed.
[14:49.720 --> 14:53.220]  I for the record, Andrew, I'm 100% on your side in that interaction.
[14:53.340 --> 14:54.820]  I totally got what you were saying.
[14:55.480 --> 14:57.180]  Yeah, crazy. And so did Nick.
[14:57.200 --> 15:00.620]  I don't know why Gavin got real pedantic real fast for for no reason there.
[15:01.020 --> 15:02.780]  Now, I thought he was saying that you couldn't do it.
[15:02.780 --> 15:04.800]  Yeah. No, I didn't understand right away.
[15:04.800 --> 15:06.860]  And then and then he had then he parsed it out.
[15:06.900 --> 15:09.860]  And I got I got there. I'm with I understand now.
[15:09.920 --> 15:12.280]  Having a vote was understandable. Yes.
[15:13.360 --> 15:14.600]  Yes. There we go. That's three.
[15:14.760 --> 15:15.660]  That's all I needed. We're good.
[15:15.820 --> 15:18.880]  Oh, that's how. Oh, that's the that's the three that you need.
[15:18.960 --> 15:20.340]  OK, I see. Yeah.
[15:20.580 --> 15:22.900]  Yeah. You you Gavin team weasel down there.
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.260]  I mean, I will say, I mean, the whole we is not me.
[15:28.440 --> 15:30.880]  And then somebody else was like some kind of animal.
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.460]  Like, I mean, I was really on the outside looking in, man.
[15:35.640 --> 15:38.560]  Oh, yeah, I like when we just had a really pleasant
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.220]  let's play recording where we weren't arguing.
[15:40.360 --> 15:41.160]  We're having a ton of fun.
[15:41.200 --> 15:42.660]  And then we came in hot to this one somehow.
[15:43.740 --> 15:45.620]  Somehow. What do you mean somehow?
[15:45.880 --> 15:49.360]  Your opening note was Andrew's an idiot somehow.
[15:51.300 --> 15:56.700]  You put the the fucking directions into the car, drove there and said,
[15:56.740 --> 15:58.840]  I don't know how we got here somehow.
[15:59.800 --> 16:01.500]  How did that happen?
[16:01.600 --> 16:03.100]  It's like you called the Uber asshole.
[16:04.020 --> 16:08.720]  Oh, God, you went to the destination you wanted.
[16:09.560 --> 16:15.080]  Andrew, do you by any chance have any notes that say anything like fuck Gavin
[16:15.080 --> 16:19.460]  or Gavin comma weasel or anything along those lines?
[16:20.420 --> 16:23.740]  I don't. I got carrot juice, which I'm not happy about.
[16:24.420 --> 16:25.600]  I bought some to try later.
[16:25.700 --> 16:27.760]  No, I bought some to try later on the show.
[16:27.760 --> 16:29.020]  But you don't have to do it.
[16:29.180 --> 16:31.260]  Why wait? Oh, man.
[16:31.320 --> 16:34.660]  But that'll be so unpleasant for the we're just starting this recording.
[16:34.840 --> 16:38.960]  Yeah, no, I understand what I just said. Yes. Yeah. OK.
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.260]  Do you think he's going to be able to see in the dark or what's going to happen?
[16:48.560 --> 16:49.720]  100 percent carrot.
[16:50.220 --> 16:55.240]  OK. 322 percent daily value of vitamin A.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.840]  Why? Why this many?
[16:58.320 --> 16:59.860]  Which one is A? What does that do for you?
[16:59.900 --> 17:00.660]  I don't know.
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.500]  Perishable, keep refrigerated.
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.860]  Anything else interesting on here?
[17:06.900 --> 17:08.860]  Feel good about what's in this bottle.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.220]  I don't. Vitamin A is retinol.
[17:12.480 --> 17:14.060]  Uh. Oh, good for eyeballs.
[17:14.880 --> 17:16.980]  Good eyesight. Uh.
[17:18.280 --> 17:19.360]  Yeah, it's all for the eyes.
[17:19.560 --> 17:20.600]  It's an antioxidant.
[17:20.680 --> 17:21.600]  It's good for your hair and skin.
[17:21.780 --> 17:23.200]  And it boosts immunity. Oh, no.
[17:23.560 --> 17:24.780]  And teeth and reproduction.
[17:25.160 --> 17:25.880]  This is great, Andrew.
[17:25.920 --> 17:27.460]  You don't have to eat fish for the rest of the day.
[17:27.720 --> 17:29.060]  I'm not an oxidant guy.
[17:29.140 --> 17:30.280]  I don't trust oxidants.
[17:30.800 --> 17:31.860]  That's why you want anti-oxidants.
[17:31.860 --> 17:34.160]  I know, so you want all of this because they're anti that.
[17:34.660 --> 17:35.600]  Any ox... well, no.
[17:35.680 --> 17:37.360]  Anything that says oxidant, I don't like.
[17:38.060 --> 17:39.380]  You're anti-antioxidant?
[17:39.600 --> 17:41.920]  I'm just any use of oxidant.
[17:42.040 --> 17:42.780]  I'm not a fan of it.
[17:43.020 --> 17:45.440]  Yeah, no. So he's not anti-antioxidant.
[17:45.540 --> 17:47.280]  He's anti-oxidant.
[17:47.880 --> 17:50.020]  If I see oxidant, I know I'm not going to like it.
[17:50.940 --> 17:53.160]  Well, what you're seeing is the absence of oxidant.
[17:53.900 --> 17:55.620]  You might be pro-oxidant.
[17:55.700 --> 17:56.420]  You don't even know.
[17:57.160 --> 17:59.880]  This just smells like carrot, which I don't know what it is.
[18:00.280 --> 18:02.300]  It's 100% carrot.
[18:02.760 --> 18:03.380]  Imagine opening it.
[18:03.460 --> 18:04.300]  It's not like apples.
[18:04.580 --> 18:06.120]  Oh, that would be awesome.
[18:06.440 --> 18:07.300]  I'd be all about that.
[18:08.060 --> 18:09.760]  Oh, what are the ingredients to this thing?
[18:10.020 --> 18:10.940]  Probably carrot juice.
[18:11.100 --> 18:12.320]  I got it. I got a couple of guesses.
[18:13.820 --> 18:15.280]  Can't be all carrot.
[18:15.780 --> 18:18.620]  It's 11 and a half carrots in this bottle.
[18:19.500 --> 18:21.540]  It says 11 and a half.
[18:22.800 --> 18:23.320]  Crazy.
[18:24.580 --> 18:27.000]  Holy shit, I could chug 11 carrots.
[18:27.320 --> 18:28.180]  I'm not doing that.
[18:28.740 --> 18:29.380]  Wait a second.
[18:30.160 --> 18:31.140]  Veggies per bottle?
[18:32.020 --> 18:33.320]  Three and a half?
[18:33.680 --> 18:35.760]  Three and a half bottles of servings?
[18:37.180 --> 18:37.860]  Where is the...
[18:37.860 --> 18:39.420]  So you're about to have three servings of carrot?
[18:41.180 --> 18:42.980]  Probably a quarter of a serving.
[18:43.440 --> 18:45.220]  Dude, your eyesight's about to blast off.
[18:45.660 --> 18:47.580]  Why wouldn't you have the whole thing? It's good for you.
[18:47.880 --> 18:48.800]  Well, this, uh.
[18:49.960 --> 18:51.280]  This, what day is it today?
[18:51.400 --> 18:52.540]  It expires tomorrow.
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.820]  So we're just sneaking in on this.
[18:55.820 --> 18:58.720]  Is it true that baby carrots are just a cut up carrot?
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.320]  Yeah, I believe that is true. Yes.
[19:00.580 --> 19:00.900]  Hmm.
[19:02.640 --> 19:04.480]  Not seeing the ingredients, which is a little.
[19:04.820 --> 19:05.780]  I think it's just carrot, man.
[19:06.380 --> 19:07.820]  Carrot juice. Yeah, that's it.
[19:07.880 --> 19:08.620]  That's all the ingredient.
[19:08.880 --> 19:09.380]  OK, here we go.
[19:11.940 --> 19:14.180]  What if we discover that Andrew loves carrots?
[19:14.580 --> 19:15.380]  I think we're about to.
[19:15.800 --> 19:17.020]  Is he going to chug the whole thing?
[19:17.420 --> 19:18.940]  No, he doesn't. He doesn't have the guts.
[19:19.700 --> 19:20.160]  You know what?
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.320]  You like it.
[19:23.220 --> 19:23.840]  Like it.
[19:24.360 --> 19:25.080]  You like it.
[19:25.640 --> 19:26.680]  You know what else is orange?
[19:26.860 --> 19:30.740]  Garfield, a lot of good orange things in your life.
[19:31.500 --> 19:32.580]  Andrew, where'd you go?
[19:35.520 --> 19:37.100]  OK, I got to say,
[19:38.520 --> 19:40.300]  I don't know how to feel about this.
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.580]  This is.
[19:43.540 --> 19:44.720]  This is baffling.
[19:45.540 --> 19:49.680]  I, as I said, was traumatized by carrot juice as a child.
[19:50.160 --> 19:55.480]  Uh, I'm beginning to wonder if maybe it was like a vegetable mixed juice
[19:55.480 --> 19:59.060]  and it wasn't just pure carrot because this just tastes like carrot.
[19:59.480 --> 20:00.840]  This is no liquid.
[20:00.920 --> 20:01.900]  What? It's a carrot.
[20:02.360 --> 20:04.460]  I Geoff, Geoff, do something.
[20:06.560 --> 20:09.740]  Uh, I'm not kind of at a loss as to what to do here.
[20:10.180 --> 20:11.260]  It's just carrot.
[20:11.400 --> 20:15.340]  Like, I don't know how you expected it to be anything other than just carrot.
[20:15.500 --> 20:16.820]  You even read the ingredients.
[20:16.820 --> 20:20.080]  You were traumatized by some sort of vegetable medley.
[20:20.460 --> 20:22.540]  I think so. I think it may have been a medley.
[20:22.900 --> 20:27.840]  And it has clouded my vision of just straight carrot juice.
[20:28.360 --> 20:30.700]  Now, would I excitedly buy this?
[20:31.260 --> 20:34.320]  No. What happened with the what you choked on it or something?
[20:35.060 --> 20:36.340]  I was trying to chug it.
[20:36.400 --> 20:37.440]  And it's a lot to chug.
[20:37.580 --> 20:39.460]  It was I didn't get far.
[20:39.640 --> 20:41.720]  No, I mean, why were you traumatized by what you thought was carrot?
[20:41.900 --> 20:44.880]  Oh, because I I was I thought it was going to be like a juice.
[20:44.880 --> 20:46.680]  Like, oh, yeah, it tasted sweet.
[20:47.140 --> 20:49.120]  And yeah, it was a vegetable.
[20:51.840 --> 20:54.780]  That's that's not unpleasant at all.
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.940]  As someone who loves carrots.
[20:57.280 --> 20:59.140]  So you could do it every day in November?
[21:00.280 --> 21:01.360]  I could.
[21:01.920 --> 21:04.100]  As someone who loves carrots.
[21:04.260 --> 21:06.860]  These carrots are not bad, is what you just said.
[21:07.160 --> 21:08.140]  That's true.
[21:08.840 --> 21:11.940]  I just expected it as a liquid to taste different.
[21:11.940 --> 21:15.320]  As someone who loves carrots, I didn't expect to like carrots.
[21:15.900 --> 21:19.620]  Well, you know, sometimes when you break something down into a juice form,
[21:19.660 --> 21:21.160]  it's not it doesn't taste the same.
[21:21.260 --> 21:23.520]  Yeah. Liquid bacon's not the same as crispy bacon.
[21:23.620 --> 21:24.240]  I got it.
[21:25.300 --> 21:26.140]  And it's true.
[21:26.440 --> 21:27.320]  I just don't know.
[21:27.340 --> 21:30.600]  Like this thinking is like, I just don't know what you I don't know.
[21:30.640 --> 21:31.480]  I just don't understand.
[21:32.460 --> 21:33.380]  I think I may.
[21:34.480 --> 21:37.360]  Well, first of all, as I said, I think it was a vegetable medley.
[21:37.360 --> 21:43.980]  And I think there may be a little bit of that child still in me of vegetables
[21:43.980 --> 21:47.840]  are gross, like vegetable juice is gross
[21:49.740 --> 21:51.640]  without actually processing that.
[21:51.740 --> 21:52.800]  No, it's just the thing you like.
[21:52.900 --> 21:53.340]  You're an adult.
[21:53.420 --> 21:54.820]  You enjoy you enjoy carrots.
[21:55.000 --> 21:55.720]  You enjoy vegetables.
[21:56.360 --> 21:57.240]  This isn't bad.
[21:57.360 --> 21:58.900]  This is a lot to take in, though.
[21:59.800 --> 22:01.600]  I couldn't imagine chugging this.
[22:02.300 --> 22:03.660]  Well, how big how big is it?
[22:03.660 --> 22:06.100]  It's only 450 milliliters,
[22:06.240 --> 22:09.600]  but it feels dense when you're consuming thick.
[22:09.740 --> 22:12.320]  I don't think that most people do chug it.
[22:12.440 --> 22:13.180]  I can't imagine.
[22:13.280 --> 22:15.500]  I wouldn't say that that's the preferred way to drink it.
[22:15.600 --> 22:17.620]  It's probably a sipper, you know?
[22:18.000 --> 22:21.640]  Yeah, it it's really throwing me off now.
[22:21.700 --> 22:23.740]  I kind of want to see who could chug carrot.
[22:23.840 --> 22:25.540]  No, I'll fuck you guys up.
[22:25.680 --> 22:26.420]  Yeah, you will.
[22:26.780 --> 22:27.880]  Of course, dude.
[22:27.880 --> 22:28.720]  I love vegetables.
[22:28.940 --> 22:30.920]  I'm not I love any.
[22:30.920 --> 22:34.500]  You could drink half a liter of liquid carrot.
[22:34.800 --> 22:36.040]  I don't see I don't see why not.
[22:36.680 --> 22:38.200]  Oh, I'd like to try.
[22:38.680 --> 22:39.220]  I'd like to try.
[22:39.300 --> 22:43.180]  Next time we get together to set stuff on fire with the incense,
[22:43.300 --> 22:44.560]  maybe we'll drink some carrot juice.
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.260]  Have we talked about the incense thing on a podcast yet?
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.360]  Yeah, extensive.
[22:50.380 --> 22:51.720]  Nick said no, Andrew said yeah.
[22:52.200 --> 22:52.600]  Oh, really?
[22:52.720 --> 22:53.860]  That wasn't part of the show.
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.060]  I never know.
[22:55.080 --> 22:56.960]  I guess, you know, listen, I'm wrong.
[22:57.040 --> 22:58.160]  If Nick says no, he's right.
[22:58.760 --> 22:59.720]  What is the incense thing?
[23:00.280 --> 23:02.660]  Eric, wait, you don't know what we're talking about.
[23:03.300 --> 23:05.540]  I'm trying to set it up for you to explain to the audience.
[23:05.860 --> 23:06.160]  That was perfect.
[23:06.180 --> 23:08.480]  That was a perfect set up that I just spiked in the ground.
[23:08.580 --> 23:10.680]  Sorry, that was a really good set up.
[23:10.720 --> 23:11.620]  Andrew, you did a great job.
[23:12.980 --> 23:15.320]  Yeah, I realized what you were doing as I was talking.
[23:16.880 --> 23:18.280]  And Gavin's got it in for you today.
[23:18.880 --> 23:21.020]  Eric came in hot and said that
[23:21.920 --> 23:24.500]  there's no way an incense stick could start a fire.
[23:24.760 --> 23:25.100]  I agree.
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.700]  It's it's going to like melt your synthetic carpet, but you're not going to.
[23:32.400 --> 23:35.040]  We talked about this because I was talking about like lighting incense
[23:35.040 --> 23:38.920]  the other day or whatever, because your room smells like cat shit piss or whatever.
[23:39.220 --> 23:41.480]  Yeah, but I didn't want to because the cats would knock it over.
[23:41.600 --> 23:42.320]  And yeah, yeah.
[23:42.340 --> 23:45.500]  And then and then it was and then I think we said, like, what are you worried about?
[23:45.500 --> 23:46.420]  Like it catching on fire?
[23:46.440 --> 23:47.060]  And you said, yeah.
[23:47.140 --> 23:49.220]  And then Nick would. Yeah, it catch on fire.
[23:49.380 --> 23:51.100]  And I'm not. No, it's not.
[23:51.720 --> 23:54.260]  I don't think it would catch on fire.
[23:54.260 --> 23:57.580]  So we're going to get together at our next live recording
[23:57.580 --> 24:02.840]  and we're going to try to build fire all a fucking survivor.
[24:03.300 --> 24:06.240]  But with incense and see if we can catch anything on fire.
[24:06.360 --> 24:07.680]  But it's a constant ember.
[24:07.940 --> 24:11.740]  It if it just sat in carpet for like 10 seconds, surely it would burn the carpet.
[24:12.000 --> 24:13.540]  We'll find out. It will melt the carpet.
[24:13.680 --> 24:14.760]  It's I don't think it's going to start a fire.
[24:15.440 --> 24:16.500]  Melt? What do you mean melt?
[24:17.400 --> 24:18.660]  Let's find out.
[24:19.300 --> 24:20.220]  Yeah, this is all.
[24:20.600 --> 24:22.520]  When do we get what are you guys doing next Friday?
[24:23.920 --> 24:24.240]  Oh.
[24:25.760 --> 24:27.000]  Setting the carpet on fire, I guess.
[24:27.060 --> 24:28.500]  Let's get some carpet and set it on fire.
[24:28.820 --> 24:30.500]  Nick's out of the office, so he won't even get to play.
[24:31.320 --> 24:32.680]  Oh, rats. You'll be fine.
[24:34.220 --> 24:34.980]  Speaking of rats.
[24:35.280 --> 24:38.640]  I got some supplemental content I want to pitch you guys a little bit.
[24:39.060 --> 24:40.700]  What? What is that?
[24:40.820 --> 24:42.420]  Speaking of rats, I have some supplemental content.
[24:42.420 --> 24:44.060]  No, no, no, I know, but what it like?
[24:44.700 --> 24:48.500]  What do you mean? What rat related content is not getting?
[24:48.980 --> 24:52.300]  I have two rat related ideas in addition to two other ideas.
[24:52.300 --> 24:55.620]  Andrew heard that there's rat content and he got sick of the weasel and he's fucking done.
[25:00.540 --> 25:03.520]  Oh, do you think the carrots? Andrew, did the carrots take you out?
[25:04.400 --> 25:04.720]  Andrew?
[25:05.180 --> 25:06.700]  I'm back. Sorry about that. My internet dropped.
[25:07.840 --> 25:09.380]  We thought maybe the carrots took you down.
[25:09.680 --> 25:10.960]  Yeah, we assumed it was carrot related.
[25:11.140 --> 25:15.420]  But to sum it up and just to, you know, people are going to post.
[25:15.740 --> 25:16.880]  Here's the thing, like Nick did.
[25:17.100 --> 25:20.360]  Here's the thing online that said don't light this on fire because it'll start a fire.
[25:20.360 --> 25:22.780]  Yeah, things on fire can start a fire.
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.400]  When you burn an incense and then you blow it out.
[25:26.520 --> 25:30.000]  So that way it just goes and it's just like the little wafts of smoke.
[25:30.120 --> 25:31.360]  That's not going to set anything on fire.
[25:31.660 --> 25:33.680]  Where do you think the wafts of smoke come from? It's an ember.
[25:34.040 --> 25:41.460]  And listen, and the reason I back Eric up here is because I can't light incense on fire with incense and it's designed to burn.
[25:41.780 --> 25:43.340]  There's no way. There's no way.
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.180]  You can't hold incense to incense and make incense catch on fire when incense is already on fire.
[25:47.180 --> 25:52.260]  So I'm excited to test this out and I'll be happy to be wrong if I am, but I don't think Eric and I are wrong.
[25:52.520 --> 25:56.280]  If you, if you hold incense to petrol, do you think it'll burn?
[25:58.700 --> 26:00.820]  Hold incense to, oh, to like gasoline?
[26:01.140 --> 26:02.120]  Yeah, puddle of gasoline.
[26:03.980 --> 26:11.140]  Uh, I, I don't know. I don't, like, that seems what an insane thing to have in your house, I guess.
[26:12.540 --> 26:12.940]  Perfect!
[26:13.320 --> 26:16.020]  Here's my bucket of gas and I put it right next to my incense.
[26:16.020 --> 26:16.840]  You did what?
[26:17.780 --> 26:20.080]  If it's, if it's not burning, then what's the problem?
[26:20.860 --> 26:25.300]  No, I'm saying it's not hot enough to catch like your normal room on fire.
[26:27.500 --> 26:30.360]  I don't think that I'm out of line here at all.
[26:30.700 --> 26:31.420]  I don't think it's...
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.340]  I don't think, I think that if you are keeping your incense next to your gasoline, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't throw your hat in the ring for this one.
[26:39.820 --> 26:41.980]  Well, I'm pulling out of this conversation.
[26:42.600 --> 26:46.840]  Don't store gasoline and incense next to each other. Everybody knows that.
[26:46.900 --> 26:49.820]  You probably don't store gasoline for very long anyway.
[26:50.360 --> 26:51.880]  Well, if you want to wait for the price to come down.
[26:52.440 --> 26:53.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true. Put it in buckets.
[26:54.100 --> 26:54.880]  What do you do with your old gas?
[26:55.560 --> 26:56.360]  I just drink it down.
[26:57.480 --> 26:59.500]  With the carrot juice? Mix it with carrot juice?
[27:00.040 --> 27:06.860]  Yeah, mix it with carrot juice. I get my, I get my, get my vitamin A and my vitamin G, gasoline, all in one place.
[27:07.000 --> 27:07.800]  Is it still antioxidant at that point?
[27:08.380 --> 27:10.240]  Oh, no, it's, it's pure oxidant.
[27:10.240 --> 27:11.600]  Oh, fuck yeah, okay.
[27:11.800 --> 27:12.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:13.320 --> 27:18.000]  So, Eric, if you feel strong about this, would you, say you left your house for an hour, and I'm in there.
[27:18.340 --> 27:18.500]  Okay.
[27:18.580 --> 27:24.280]  And I've got like a hundred incense sticks, and I'm just lighting them and blowing them out and flinging them all over. Would you be fine with that?
[27:25.040 --> 27:27.140]  Yeah, I don't, I don't think it's going to catch anything on fire.
[27:27.400 --> 27:28.300]  Oh, wow, okay.
[27:29.200 --> 27:30.980]  I was not expecting you to say yeah.
[27:32.180 --> 27:32.540]  Okay.
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.740]  I'll be, like, wigging them at the curtains, into the kitchen, towels.
[27:37.740 --> 27:50.420]  I'm not sure, I'm not sure why you would be doing this, or what scenario this would exist in, because I'm talking about a real practical scenario, where you light incense, put it on your little shelf, and then have it be incense in a room.
[27:50.520 --> 27:52.600]  And then a cat knocks it over, and then your whole house burns down.
[27:52.820 --> 27:55.840]  I think what Eric is saying is that's never, ever, ever going to happen.
[27:56.180 --> 27:57.180]  Yeah, that's it.
[27:58.420 --> 28:03.260]  The fact that he needs a hundred incense to burn your house down makes me feel like he doesn't even believe in your argument.
[28:05.020 --> 28:05.840]  That's a lot of incense.
[28:05.840 --> 28:12.020]  Here's what I need. I need a drum of gasoline, a hundred cats, and a thousand incense sticks.
[28:15.180 --> 28:17.240]  Nick is typing when he can just talk.
[28:18.100 --> 28:18.420]  Yeah!
[28:20.980 --> 28:22.120]  Great podcasting, bud!
[28:22.540 --> 28:24.020]  He does it all the time, he types.
[28:24.320 --> 28:24.540]  He does.
[28:25.260 --> 28:27.440]  He is in this argument.
[28:28.200 --> 28:28.780]  That is true.
[28:29.320 --> 28:31.140]  If he gets all the way in, he has to lean forwards, though.
[28:31.260 --> 28:33.560]  Yeah, and he's in this argument.
[28:33.560 --> 28:35.500]  My back's bad now, you know?
[28:38.100 --> 28:39.380]  Whose side is Nick on?
[28:40.140 --> 28:40.740]  I'm on your side.
[28:40.900 --> 28:41.160]  Thanks.
[28:41.780 --> 28:42.920]  Yeah, you're right.
[28:45.700 --> 28:51.500]  Gavin's just testing to see what level it will take for you to actually change your side.
[28:51.780 --> 28:57.460]  If you leave an incense stick on fire and then just leave, that's probably not good.
[28:57.940 --> 29:02.800]  If you light an incense stick on fire and go, and blow out the fire of it...
[29:02.800 --> 29:05.860]  Look, I can already see the Reddit comments on this whole thing.
[29:05.980 --> 29:09.680]  I'm not worried about it, I have my incense, I'm not lighting my house on fire with it.
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.760]  I hate to see Team Weasel turn on themselves so quickly.
[29:13.100 --> 29:19.960]  I will say, I have lit incense every night in my house, probably since the day I met Emily,
[29:20.120 --> 29:23.840]  because she's big into incense, and when she gets home, you know, she works late at the salon,
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.780]  and so when she comes home, I like to have the house all smelling and looking good for her,
[29:28.080 --> 29:29.900]  and so I always light a little bit of incense for her.
[29:29.900 --> 29:37.020]  And every day of my life for probably seven years, and I have never had even close to an errant issue
[29:37.020 --> 29:43.000]  with incense setting anything on fire, or getting out of control, or being dangerous in any way whatsoever.
[29:43.200 --> 29:44.920]  Out of control. This incense is fucking out of control!
[29:45.440 --> 29:46.820]  This incense is out of control.
[29:50.200 --> 29:54.200]  But I want to go back to what... I want to know what Geoff's rat content is.
[29:54.200 --> 30:01.660]  Oh! Yeah, so I came... I went into the lab the other day. I felt like it had been a minute since I'd come up with some new ideas,
[30:02.460 --> 30:07.540]  and I've been thinking a lot about supplemental, I've been thinking a lot about getting out and doing stuff in the world,
[30:07.680 --> 30:10.700]  and so I came up with a couple of ideas I wanted to pitch you guys on today.
[30:10.780 --> 30:16.040]  The first one, I like. I think Eric will not like it specifically, and I think we won't do it.
[30:16.260 --> 30:18.560]  In much the same way you guys won't let me do the tombstone one.
[30:18.760 --> 30:21.200]  But that's okay, because maybe somebody will make a video game out of it.
[30:21.200 --> 30:26.320]  You guys know I want to go do a show where we walk around the mall, right?
[30:26.400 --> 30:32.460]  I wanted to call it Mallwalkers. Everybody on Earth let me know there's another show called Mallwalkers where people do that.
[30:32.900 --> 30:37.180]  We won't call it Mallwalkers, but guess what? Other people play GTA. We still play GTA.
[30:37.500 --> 30:41.180]  We're allowed to go fucking to a mall and record ourselves. We'll probably still do it in some fashion.
[30:41.620 --> 30:47.500]  But that got me thinking maybe we'll tweak the idea a little bit, although I do just think us walking around the mall is a phenomenal idea,
[30:47.520 --> 30:48.760]  and I'm still on board for it.
[30:48.760 --> 30:51.620]  But I got to thinking, what if we just call it something different, like Mallrats?
[30:51.700 --> 30:57.180]  And I was like, oh, I love that phrase, but then that's like a Kevin Smith thing, and I think he's making a sequel to Mallrats, even maybe.
[30:57.380 --> 31:01.220]  And so I don't want to be caught up in the middle of that, so I was thinking like Mallbrats, right?
[31:01.260 --> 31:06.520]  Because that's like a play on Mallrats, but Bratsummer's over, and I don't want to relive that.
[31:07.240 --> 31:13.880]  So what if instead we have a show where we all go around the mall, and I get one of those rubber mallrats,
[31:13.880 --> 31:18.380]  one of those rubber rats, and I hide it somewhere in the mall, and then we play rat mall.
[31:18.800 --> 31:22.140]  And then everybody goes around the mall, and you try to find the rat I hid in the mall.
[31:23.700 --> 31:24.420]  Rat mall!
[31:25.280 --> 31:26.140]  Rat mall!
[31:27.700 --> 31:30.260]  Gavin, any thoughts on rat mall?
[31:30.700 --> 31:31.360]  Sign me up!
[31:32.760 --> 31:34.540]  Oh, I knew Gavin was on board from the jump.
[31:35.100 --> 31:36.300]  I'll play rat mall!
[31:36.800 --> 31:41.020]  And I was just thinking how much fun it would be if there was unintended consequences,
[31:41.020 --> 31:45.600]  like people thought the rat was real, or security finds it, you know, and they're like,
[31:45.660 --> 31:49.400]  what the fuck is this rubber rat? Is it a prank? But it's not a prank, it's just us playing a game.
[31:49.900 --> 31:52.020]  I foresee a lot of unintended hilarity.
[31:52.640 --> 31:57.340]  I also, man, I want somebody else to hide it so you can play rat mall, Geoff.
[31:57.640 --> 32:03.900]  Yeah, maybe we'll get Emily or somebody, or anybody's wife or friend can come out and hide it for us,
[32:03.940 --> 32:05.240]  and then we can all play rat mall together.
[32:05.400 --> 32:08.180]  I think you should have to have somebody in the mall hide it for you.
[32:08.180 --> 32:13.720]  You hand a guy his cell locker a rat? Hey, do something about this.
[32:13.920 --> 32:15.580]  We need an inside person, yeah.
[32:16.220 --> 32:18.100]  Okay, so that's my first idea. Rat mall.
[32:18.520 --> 32:20.200]  Can we wear exterminator clothes?
[32:20.740 --> 32:21.500]  I think we should.
[32:22.160 --> 32:27.280]  I think you can dress however it makes you feel like you are best at finding the rat.
[32:27.760 --> 32:32.360]  I want to come up with my own pest control company and get a logo made and wear a big...
[32:32.360 --> 32:36.020]  I know what Nick will be wearing. He'll be wearing a big pair of red boots.
[32:36.020 --> 32:37.140]  That's right!
[32:38.200 --> 32:43.040]  Okay, here's my second idea I want to hit you guys with. I like this idea better than the first idea.
[32:43.180 --> 32:46.040]  I've been thinking a lot about the past. I've been reminiscing a little bit.
[32:46.500 --> 32:52.860]  And one of my favorite productions I ever made when we were doing Achievement Hunter back in the day
[32:52.860 --> 32:55.980]  was this show I made called Sunday Driving.
[32:56.380 --> 32:59.620]  And what that show was is essentially what I did already.
[32:59.840 --> 33:02.100]  It's an old-timey thing that people used to do back in the day.
[33:02.180 --> 33:04.400]  They would just go Sunday Driving back when cars were novel.
[33:04.820 --> 33:08.320]  And you would just drive around and enjoy the weather and listen to music or whatever.
[33:08.760 --> 33:12.380]  And so in Grand Theft Auto, I had this game that we would do.
[33:12.980 --> 33:14.420]  I don't know. I guess it wasn't really a game.
[33:14.420 --> 33:19.160]  But this video we would do where I would drive around and I would pick somebody up on the street, like say Gavin.
[33:19.760 --> 33:21.520]  And then we would just start talking and have a conversation.
[33:21.620 --> 33:24.960]  Then we'd go look for somebody else and eventually we'd find Andrew and pick him up.
[33:24.960 --> 33:27.040]  And then find Eric or whatever.
[33:27.100 --> 33:29.660]  And just go through the whole thing and make a video out of it and we're just talking.
[33:29.660 --> 33:34.640]  And then the conversation flows interestingly because you're adding people to it as it goes.
[33:34.980 --> 33:37.220]  And I was thinking about how much fun that was.
[33:37.300 --> 33:38.560]  We've been back in GTA.
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.240]  We've been kicking the tires on GTA quite a bit.
[33:41.320 --> 33:43.200]  But I thought, why do that in GTA?
[33:43.420 --> 33:45.060]  Why not do it in real life?
[33:45.240 --> 33:51.900]  What if you guys go downtown in Austin in like a five or a six-mile radius and just stand on street corners?
[33:52.240 --> 33:55.100]  And maybe one of you gives me like an address location.
[33:55.280 --> 33:57.600]  And I just have to drive and pick up like say Eric.
[33:57.600 --> 34:00.740]  And then Eric and I have to figure out how to navigate to Gavin and Nick.
[34:00.840 --> 34:02.620]  And we just have a conversation while we do it.
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.060]  And then once we're all in the car, we go get ice cream or hot dogs or something.
[34:07.480 --> 34:08.200]  I love it.
[34:08.400 --> 34:10.780]  We do Sunday driving in real life on a Sunday.
[34:10.940 --> 34:14.340]  And everyone you pick up has the clue to the next person.
[34:14.460 --> 34:15.820]  Yeah, that's like something like that.
[34:15.880 --> 34:17.860]  So we gamify it a little bit.
[34:17.940 --> 34:20.560]  But the point of it is the conversation and the journey.
[34:20.560 --> 34:22.340]  Not necessarily like winning.
[34:22.520 --> 34:23.760]  So we don't want to make it too hard.
[34:23.760 --> 34:26.860]  But I like the idea of there being kind of stakes and us trying to figure.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.460]  I feel like that would be more fun than just GPSing to somebody, you know?
[34:31.620 --> 34:32.580]  Yeah, definitely.
[34:33.140 --> 34:36.340]  I think no maps is a really fun way to do that too.
[34:36.820 --> 34:40.600]  With like just like trying to figure out what streets everything is on.
[34:40.760 --> 34:41.240]  I think it's great.
[34:41.520 --> 34:41.760]  Yeah.
[34:41.840 --> 34:43.800]  And then like I was thinking we could dash cam that.
[34:43.940 --> 34:49.380]  But also, if you don't want to, because I'm also cognizant of not wanting to step on toes.
[34:49.380 --> 34:54.160]  I know 100%Eat does a thing where you guys record yourselves from the dash cam.
[34:54.480 --> 34:56.200]  And so I wouldn't want to appear too similar to that.
[34:56.460 --> 35:01.820]  So another idea I had, if we don't want to do it that way, is then we could go back and cam it in GTA.
[35:03.100 --> 35:04.860]  Camming it in GTA would be insane.
[35:05.640 --> 35:07.480]  That is so much extra work.
[35:07.580 --> 35:09.140]  I'd rather just film it.
[35:09.360 --> 35:11.360]  What an insane amount of work that is.
[35:11.600 --> 35:13.400]  I don't think it is an insane amount of work.
[35:13.540 --> 35:15.060]  I think we just listen to it.
[35:15.100 --> 35:17.360]  And then we just all play GTA while we listen to it.
[35:17.360 --> 35:20.420]  We would just machinimate it as a big one.
[35:20.600 --> 35:23.900]  And then think about how realistic the audio would sound.
[35:24.080 --> 35:25.800]  That is crazy.
[35:26.200 --> 35:27.300]  That's crazy.
[35:27.940 --> 35:28.420]  Wow.
[35:29.040 --> 35:37.100]  Either way we do it, I think a real life slash real life and GTA Sunday driving would be a lot of fun.
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.620]  And I think that might be a cool Patreon show.
[35:42.040 --> 35:43.600]  What if we do it in real life?
[35:43.600 --> 35:47.500]  What if we do it in real life where you pick me up and then I have the clue to go get Gavin.
[35:47.720 --> 35:49.420]  And then Gavin has the clue to go get Nick.
[35:49.440 --> 35:56.000]  And then after we go get Nick, we record all this in real life and then we do it in the game.
[35:56.200 --> 35:59.720]  But at that point where we go get Nick, that's where we end.
[35:59.880 --> 36:03.160]  And then we pick up the rest of the conversation and it's in the game.
[36:03.220 --> 36:07.100]  But now Andrew can go and we pick up Andrew and then we do something in the game.
[36:07.220 --> 36:07.900]  That's cool too.
[36:08.040 --> 36:09.580]  So then we are all participating.
[36:09.760 --> 36:10.380]  I like that too.
[36:10.380 --> 36:19.280]  If you didn't want to do the navigation thing, maybe I'm on a Discord call with Geoff and I have maps of Austin.
[36:19.700 --> 36:21.340]  And I'm the only one who knows where everybody is.
[36:21.500 --> 36:25.620]  And I'm having to try to relay to Geoff how to get to these people.
[36:26.040 --> 36:30.420]  I think that is a completely separate idea that's its own show.
[36:31.640 --> 36:35.860]  I keep talking and nobody explodes, but I think that's a great idea.
[36:37.120 --> 36:37.620]  Andrew navigation?
[36:37.620 --> 36:41.180]  We do like a scavenger hunt or something through Austin and Andrew navigates us.
[36:41.240 --> 36:42.180]  I think that could be fucking fun.
[36:42.580 --> 36:46.040]  I mean, we can combine it with this too, but I think there's a lot there just in that alone.
[36:47.120 --> 36:47.780]  So that's great.
[36:48.060 --> 36:49.880]  That's kind of like the second idea I had in the lab.
[36:49.940 --> 36:53.800]  And then the third idea I had, I actually had the other night.
[36:55.360 --> 36:56.700]  We went to dinner.
[36:57.360 --> 37:00.880]  What was it? Sunday night for your small wife's birthday, Eric?
[37:01.020 --> 37:01.280]  Yes.
[37:01.840 --> 37:07.300]  And so when we were done, we all said goodbye in a parking garage.
[37:07.300 --> 37:13.240]  And I was just thinking, it struck me that we were the only people in the parking garage.
[37:13.280 --> 37:15.440]  It was like 11 o'clock at night when we were finished with dinner.
[37:15.720 --> 37:17.400]  And it was just like this downtown parking garage.
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.460]  And it was empty and the sound was like, I don't know, the sound was kind of baffling.
[37:22.780 --> 37:24.720]  And it was just like, it was a cool environment.
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.900]  And I thought, it's funny that we're the only people in this whole space right now.
[37:28.960 --> 37:31.740]  It would be fun to film something in here, but everybody was going their separate ways.
[37:31.840 --> 37:34.620]  And it was, you know, we all went to bed or whatever, went home.
[37:35.100 --> 37:42.320]  And that got me thinking, we should go back and do a podcast where we record in odd spaces.
[37:42.500 --> 37:47.420]  Now, there was a podcast back in the day that Rooster Teeth, that was on The Roost called Podcast But Outside.
[37:47.620 --> 37:52.760]  I don't want to rip off their idea where they would just like set up a folding table and they would invite people to come and they would have a conversation.
[37:53.120 --> 38:01.980]  But what if we did like a supplemental series called Hide and Speak where we went out in public and then we've had to find a place where we hid.
[38:01.980 --> 38:06.440]  Kind of like how Gavin would hide in Halo 2 behind the ramp.
[38:06.840 --> 38:13.600]  And then we get in there, we hide. We're in public, but we're like, I don't know, behind a tree or we're in like a cubby somewhere.
[38:13.740 --> 38:20.640]  And we're hidden and we record until somebody catches us, sees us, or until we hit like 20 minutes and then it's over.
[38:20.760 --> 38:24.580]  And if we like hit 20 minutes, we complete the goal, which is to stay hidden for the whole time.
[38:24.700 --> 38:29.440]  But we just do public podcasts that are hidden from the public. Hide and Speak.
[38:29.440 --> 38:34.060]  I love it just for the name. So I'm in. Great.
[38:34.160 --> 38:35.480]  Did that start with the name first?
[38:35.820 --> 38:37.980]  No, I came up with the name about an hour ago.
[38:38.480 --> 38:40.200]  The name's phenomenal.
[38:40.460 --> 38:44.560]  Right before we started the let's play, I came up with the name.
[38:45.280 --> 38:48.140]  Okay, last idea I have then. This one is a video game idea.
[38:48.900 --> 38:51.460]  I saw today, and I just had this idea today.
[38:51.460 --> 39:04.020]  I saw today on the regulation subreddit, somebody mentioned that in Feed the Beast, which is a Minecraft mod utility, I guess would be how you describe it.
[39:04.700 --> 39:09.000]  There is a rats mod where you can play as rats and have rats all over the game and stuff.
[39:09.180 --> 39:17.380]  And so I was thinking, what if when we finally play Minecraft, we do, but we only play as rats and we only do rat things and we call it RatCraft.
[39:19.260 --> 39:24.200]  I mean, I like that as a like, yeah, I want to do that.
[39:24.720 --> 39:26.520]  Like a one-off, it wouldn't be like a whole series.
[39:26.960 --> 39:28.840]  Yeah, I think that's fun.
[39:28.980 --> 39:31.700]  We return to Minecraft one time only for RatCraft.
[39:31.720 --> 39:32.440]  And it's RatCraft.
[39:32.860 --> 39:33.920]  And we play once.
[39:35.140 --> 39:39.360]  This concludes, oh, I have one other idea. I don't think we'll actually do it, but I was thinking it would be fun.
[39:39.420 --> 39:43.060]  If you guys ever wanted to have a roadside attraction, because I feel like that could be a lot of fun.
[39:44.760 --> 39:51.000]  An area that people haven't really dove into yet, I think that could be that could be fun is retractions.
[39:51.320 --> 39:53.540]  You know, like when a newspaper has to run a retraction.
[39:53.700 --> 40:03.020]  What if you had a roadside retractions attraction where it was a roadside attraction that was full of retractions and you would go in and you would just see all the people, all the things people had to apologize for.
[40:03.060 --> 40:03.860]  That's it. I'm done.
[40:03.960 --> 40:05.020]  What are the retractions about?
[40:05.940 --> 40:08.360]  Anything that was in the New York Times, they had to issue a retraction.
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.140]  It's just all retractions are there.
[40:10.240 --> 40:13.180]  So if you ever wanted to see a retraction, that's the clearinghouse of all retractions.
[40:13.640 --> 40:16.940]  People are hearing this and probably going like, that's that's so weird.
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.820]  That's crazy. Whatever. Drive anywhere on Route 66 and stop on any of those things.
[40:20.920 --> 40:23.400]  We just saw cars in the ground that you could spray paint.
[40:23.520 --> 40:24.660]  This is no different from that.
[40:24.960 --> 40:26.960]  This is this is not a bad idea.
[40:27.080 --> 40:30.180]  Yeah, it's no different than the world's largest thermometer.
[40:33.400 --> 40:35.760]  I like all these out in the world ideas.
[40:36.400 --> 40:40.320]  Well, the roadside retractions attraction was just the dumb name idea I had that I had to throw out there.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.960]  It's been making me giggle for a couple of weeks.
[40:42.060 --> 40:45.160]  But the other the other things I would actually like to do.
[40:45.780 --> 40:47.920]  It reminds me, Andrew, did you ever find the building?
[40:49.180 --> 40:51.400]  What? Oh, no. Still looking.
[40:52.040 --> 40:55.080]  Still looking. I'm still trying to find it. No idea where it is.
[40:55.940 --> 41:00.160]  This is from when Andrew sent me a picture of somewhere in Austin and I had to find where it was.
[41:00.160 --> 41:01.320]  And I immediately found it.
[41:01.380 --> 41:03.340]  And then I sent him somewhere in Nanaimo.
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.560]  Oh, just a picture of a place that he's still never found.
[41:07.720 --> 41:08.960]  How long ago was that?
[41:10.160 --> 41:10.980]  Months. Months ago.
[41:12.260 --> 41:16.080]  I happened to pick a coffee shop that he had previously been to.
[41:16.600 --> 41:18.540]  Yeah, you sent me a picture of a building.
[41:18.820 --> 41:20.440]  It didn't say the name, but I recognized it.
[41:20.460 --> 41:23.800]  I was like, oh, that's that's that's how Siona went there with whoever.
[41:25.540 --> 41:26.900]  Yeah, still haven't found it. Still looking.
[41:27.400 --> 41:29.260]  You have to update us when you do.
[41:29.260 --> 41:31.640]  Oh, listen, it'll be top of my notes.
[41:32.060 --> 41:37.040]  Oh, that's good. I actually have one thing that to bring to the table.
[41:37.320 --> 41:39.760]  And it's Gavin won't stop sending me voice memos.
[41:40.440 --> 41:45.440]  We found out at dinner on your small wife's birthday, which is for some reason also my birthday.
[41:48.460 --> 41:51.160]  For some reason, I got brought a happy birthday dessert.
[41:51.440 --> 41:53.480]  And so did she. And I was like, oh, my birthday too.
[41:53.480 --> 41:59.320]  My wife said that she was so happy that that happened because it wasn't like she didn't have like all the attention on her.
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.260]  It was like, oh, good. Everyone's paying attention to Gavin and like the goofy birthday thing.
[42:03.500 --> 42:07.520]  By the way, that that fucking place that we went is my favorite restaurant in all of Austin.
[42:07.660 --> 42:10.960]  I love it so much, although the service was a little all over the map.
[42:10.980 --> 42:14.220]  I thought so. But fucking yogurt is not dessert.
[42:15.140 --> 42:17.940]  That was really good. I loved it. I thought it was fantastic.
[42:18.320 --> 42:22.980]  But during that meal, Eric let me know that he hates voice memos being sent.
[42:22.980 --> 42:25.880]  Yeah, it's faster for the sender, but slower for the receiver.
[42:26.100 --> 42:28.120]  It is. It's absolutely true.
[42:28.280 --> 42:37.740]  If you're so distracted that you can't type out your thing concisely, that you're just recording a voice note that is like 45 seconds long because you're driving or whatever.
[42:38.140 --> 42:41.520]  Don't bother. Yeah, I've received a lot and I've never sent any.
[42:41.600 --> 42:44.680]  But now I'm sending them. He is sending them to Eric.
[42:44.840 --> 42:47.780]  He's just said just a slurp of his coffee.
[42:48.560 --> 42:50.720]  Yep. Just out here enjoying some coffee.
[42:50.720 --> 42:54.440]  Do you have any previews? Do you have anything lined up that you could share?
[42:55.180 --> 43:00.220]  I've got a good response from Eric because he sent one in reply.
[43:02.520 --> 43:04.480]  I hate this.
[43:05.880 --> 43:07.920]  None of that came through.
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.500]  None of it came through. I think I said, I hate this.
[43:11.760 --> 43:12.700]  That is correct.
[43:15.460 --> 43:18.880]  Not a fan, but it is the only way that Gavin texts me now.
[43:20.720 --> 43:27.400]  You sit through it. Also, it's you can see like it'll transcribe it, but it won't transcribe.
[43:27.580 --> 43:29.480]  It says like tap for more or whatever.
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.720]  And then at that point, you're already so so many steps into this thing that it's just not none of this is worth it.
[43:34.780 --> 43:35.460]  It's the worst.
[43:35.980 --> 43:41.680]  But now, because I don't text Eric that much and I want to send him voice memos, I'm just sending them for no reason.
[43:41.740 --> 43:46.040]  I'm just like sending like little check-ins. I'm just telling about stuff that I would never normally text him.
[43:46.040 --> 43:54.700]  It's so banal. And that's really what the voice memo thing is anyway, is that it's just banal stuff that is to you and not for you.
[43:55.400 --> 43:57.760]  I probably won't play down the mic, but it's transcribed it.
[43:57.820 --> 43:58.560]  This is what I sent him.
[43:59.020 --> 44:00.620]  Hey, man. Yeah, I'm just out with dinner.
[44:00.780 --> 44:05.500]  I'm wondering your thoughts on whether I should get this big guy chocolate cake or not.
[44:05.740 --> 44:08.960]  Still undecided, but I figured I'd ask around some friends.
[44:09.540 --> 44:13.400]  Yeah, because one of the desserts at the restaurant I was at was a big guy chocolate cake.
[44:13.860 --> 44:15.840]  So, you know, I'm just checking in. I'm just seeing how he's doing.
[44:16.080 --> 44:16.780]  Did you get it?
[44:17.240 --> 44:19.980]  I didn't because he didn't say anything apart from I hate this.
[44:20.320 --> 44:23.720]  Yeah, I think I just said I hate this. I didn't care about the big guy chocolate cake.
[44:24.380 --> 44:26.060]  My wife, though, loves it.
[44:26.100 --> 44:27.700]  My wife thinks this is hilarious.
[44:27.980 --> 44:30.920]  She keeps telling me what to say back to Gavin and I just keep going.
[44:30.940 --> 44:36.320]  I don't want to like I don't want I tried like once and then I just went this is not for me.
[44:36.400 --> 44:37.680]  I don't want to encourage this.
[44:37.840 --> 44:39.380]  What did she want you to say to me?
[44:39.380 --> 44:46.120]  I don't remember what it was or what because you've sent me a bunch of voice memos and she has heard them.
[44:46.280 --> 44:48.860]  And then she would be like, oh, say this. And I don't remember what it is.
[44:48.980 --> 44:51.760]  And it's just like, no, I don't want to encourage this behavior.
[44:52.040 --> 44:52.820]  This is terrible.
[44:53.940 --> 44:59.120]  I think you two should have to communicate exclusively via walkie talkie for like a week.
[45:00.020 --> 45:04.360]  I think you both need walkie talkies and that's the only way you can talk to each other.
[45:05.100 --> 45:06.740]  You don't have to be as concise, though.
[45:06.740 --> 45:09.020]  I don't have to do it all as big what one big long take.
[45:09.260 --> 45:15.740]  No, but I think it's funny for you to just be able to like buzz in like you guys get your code names, whatever your trucker names are.
[45:16.000 --> 45:16.960]  Use those.
[45:17.300 --> 45:19.600]  What is what's the range on a walkie talkie?
[45:19.800 --> 45:22.740]  I'm sure you could get a ridiculously long range one.
[45:22.900 --> 45:24.300]  Maybe we should get into ham radio.
[45:25.100 --> 45:27.640]  You can go across the fucking globe in ham radio.
[45:28.060 --> 45:29.780]  Yeah, you'd bounce it off the atmosphere.
[45:30.180 --> 45:32.600]  Let's see what some long range walkie talkies go for.
[45:33.160 --> 45:35.460]  But long range is like what is long range?
[45:35.460 --> 45:37.800]  I have no idea, man.
[45:38.060 --> 45:41.260]  Four hundred dollars will get you to walkie talkie.
[45:41.340 --> 45:41.740]  Oh, my God.
[45:41.780 --> 45:43.600]  They're normally a thousand dollars.
[45:43.660 --> 45:47.620]  But but everyone's saying like it's a pretty unlimited range.
[45:47.940 --> 45:50.260]  What does that mean? Unlimited range?
[45:51.100 --> 45:51.900]  Yeah, I believe that.
[45:52.560 --> 45:53.440]  I don't believe that at all.
[45:53.620 --> 45:56.260]  Unlimited distance, unlimited use nationwide.
[45:56.440 --> 45:57.480]  I think it's just a phone.
[45:57.480 --> 45:59.600]  I have a 50 foot ham.
[46:00.400 --> 46:06.640]  I have a 50 foot ham tower that gives me about 13 miles of range with these walkie talkies around the house.
[46:06.820 --> 46:08.600]  What the fuck?
[46:10.940 --> 46:12.280]  You have a what?
[46:13.280 --> 46:14.960]  Let's get into ham towers.
[46:15.120 --> 46:16.700]  I don't want to get into ham towers.
[46:17.780 --> 46:20.700]  We're in a different ham zone, but we're back in the ham zone.
[46:21.080 --> 46:23.540]  We're in the return to the ham zone?
[46:24.480 --> 46:26.260]  We're a whole different kind of ham fandom.
[46:27.260 --> 46:27.660]  Wow.
[46:28.380 --> 46:29.900]  Maybe that's what the ham was about.
[46:30.740 --> 46:31.620]  Oh, ham fan?
[46:32.160 --> 46:32.400]  Yeah.
[46:32.460 --> 46:34.340]  Could have been a radio fan, not a Hamilton fan.
[46:35.320 --> 46:40.440]  Yeah, I'd be willing to if we could get the range, I would do the walkie talkie fan.
[46:42.220 --> 46:43.360]  I just think it's funny.
[46:43.980 --> 46:44.900]  For how long? A week?
[46:45.280 --> 46:45.560]  Yeah.
[46:46.980 --> 46:48.420]  You have to buzz whenever.
[46:48.960 --> 46:50.940]  It's more intrusive, I feel like.
[46:51.580 --> 46:53.340]  I don't want to do that.
[46:53.760 --> 46:54.600]  Because it's a live thing.
[46:54.860 --> 46:55.040]  More intrusive than a phone?
[46:55.040 --> 46:56.100]  Yeah, I think so.
[46:56.180 --> 46:59.040]  Because the message isn't implied like you can get to it when you get to it.
[46:59.460 --> 47:05.520]  Where you're just demanding that Eric respond in this moment to help you with your cake decision.
[47:06.220 --> 47:07.620]  Oh, I got a voice message from Eric.
[47:07.880 --> 47:08.380]  Oh, you did?
[47:08.700 --> 47:09.880]  I'll see if it plays through.
[47:11.120 --> 47:13.660]  I don't want to do that, thank you.
[47:15.360 --> 47:18.840]  Now, is that the ham radio or just radios in general?
[47:19.060 --> 47:20.080]  I assume all of this.
[47:20.360 --> 47:21.020]  All of it?
[47:21.460 --> 47:23.520]  Yes, Gavin is right.
[47:23.960 --> 47:32.240]  You know, I gotta say though, that's a great way to communicate because I feel like I can understand Eric more here because of the inflection.
[47:32.740 --> 47:34.920]  I'm not just having to interpret the text.
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.540]  Right, right, but that was a quick, that one was a, what, a three second thing.
[47:39.720 --> 47:43.920]  Gavin is sending me stuff that's like 25 seconds plus and you're trapped.
[47:44.060 --> 47:48.920]  If I could like skip through or fast forward or whatever, then at least there's something there.
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.320]  And also, it's about nothing.
[47:50.600 --> 47:51.380]  There's the difference.
[47:51.660 --> 47:52.700]  It's about big guy chocolate cake.
[47:52.700 --> 47:53.980]  There's the difference, Eric.
[47:54.020 --> 47:56.720]  You might be trapped, but I hang on his every word.
[47:58.120 --> 47:59.660]  Go sit in his lap and shit.
[48:02.180 --> 48:08.740]  What if I send the messages directly to your small wife and she can relay any important info to you?
[48:08.980 --> 48:10.120]  Why don't you go ahead and do that?
[48:11.540 --> 48:12.280]  I'm scared.
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.820]  Yeah, you're gonna be texting my wife voice messages.
[48:17.120 --> 48:18.180]  Hey, so what have you guys been up to?
[48:18.440 --> 48:20.720]  Gavin's been sending my wife a lot of voice memos.
[48:24.160 --> 48:27.740]  Maybe we need to add a Slack channel that's just voice memos.
[48:29.500 --> 48:30.460]  It's terrible.
[48:30.820 --> 48:33.760]  Oh man, we found out that our fart channel got archived.
[48:33.980 --> 48:34.720]  A lot of farts are gone.
[48:35.300 --> 48:35.860]  That's a bummer.
[48:36.240 --> 48:39.080]  Slack is holding Geoff's farts hostage.
[48:39.800 --> 48:41.240]  Our farts went behind the paywall.
[48:41.600 --> 48:43.300]  Because they're over 90 days old.
[48:44.220 --> 48:46.580]  You're supposed to pay for Slack and we just don't.
[48:47.060 --> 48:50.520]  There is a premium, yeah, paid for version of Slack and then the free version.
[48:50.520 --> 48:55.920]  And when I went to film something, I thought I could pull Geoff's farts and nothing was there.
[48:56.260 --> 48:59.620]  And so I texted him, did you delete all your farts? Where did the farts go?
[48:59.780 --> 49:01.720]  Andrew was like, why did you delete all your farts?
[49:01.720 --> 49:02.980]  Why did you do this?
[49:03.120 --> 49:05.380]  Like, very accusatory. And I was like, what?
[49:05.640 --> 49:09.120]  Well, I just assumed that if anyone were gonna delete them, like, I just...
[49:09.120 --> 49:09.820]  Why would I ever?
[49:10.100 --> 49:11.920]  I don't know, that's why I was asking.
[49:11.920 --> 49:15.220]  And then Geoff sent me a screenshot.
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.040]  I didn't have it on my display of them saying that after like 30 or whatever, however many days, it archives it.
[49:21.160 --> 49:25.820]  It's not permanently gone. If I pay for Slack now, they will reappear.
[49:26.140 --> 49:28.360]  So they're holding Geoff's farts hostage.
[49:28.520 --> 49:29.640]  I think it's so funny.
[49:30.040 --> 49:30.100]  That's crazy.
[49:30.260 --> 49:33.520]  I was able to find the farts on my phone and send them to him.
[49:33.600 --> 49:38.420]  And I was actually kind of happy because when I did, I remembered, I had completely forgotten that right before I stopped recording,
[49:38.500 --> 49:40.480]  I had started recording all my diarrhea as well.
[49:40.480 --> 49:41.860]  And man, those are some sounds.
[49:42.180 --> 49:43.960]  Yeah, why are you recording diarrhea?
[49:44.120 --> 49:45.060]  I don't know.
[49:46.220 --> 49:47.420]  That's genuinely repulsive.
[49:47.560 --> 49:48.840]  I don't know, it was pretty gross, right?
[49:48.960 --> 49:51.360]  I don't know what the point of that was, but I did it.
[49:52.260 --> 49:53.420]  And I got a bunch of them.
[49:54.020 --> 49:56.620]  Where are you holding the phone during that?
[49:57.180 --> 49:59.100]  Just out in front of me? Like if I was reading it?
[49:59.240 --> 49:59.380]  Yeah.
[50:00.200 --> 50:03.280]  You think I'm like wedging it down into the toilet to get superior sound?
[50:03.580 --> 50:03.780]  No.
[50:04.040 --> 50:06.220]  Yes, I did think that.
[50:06.220 --> 50:14.260]  I think it's because my shits are so loud that I can have a shit upstairs and Emily can hear it in the front yard.
[50:15.500 --> 50:18.000]  Why don't you put your phone in the front yard and we'll see if that's true.
[50:18.080 --> 50:19.820]  We can do that. We can absolutely do that.
[50:20.760 --> 50:22.960]  See how loud my shits are? Yeah, we can do that.
[50:23.200 --> 50:24.660]  I can play some for you right now. It's very loud.
[50:24.960 --> 50:26.180]  No, it's good. We're good.
[50:26.520 --> 50:29.360]  No, I mean, we'll just test it with the experiment later.
[50:29.520 --> 50:30.520]  Yeah, you don't need to send it.
[50:30.820 --> 50:32.080]  You sure? Because I got plenty.
[50:32.160 --> 50:33.940]  No, we're sure. Thanks.
[50:34.160 --> 50:34.480]  Okay.
[50:34.480 --> 50:41.020]  I needed the the Geoff Farts for a video that we filmed in the Quiet Place game.
[50:41.120 --> 50:44.640]  I got a code for it and I'd been playing it and they had a feature where you can make,
[50:45.200 --> 50:52.680]  use your mic to capture your environmental audio doing testing of different things that you wouldn't see in the movie,
[50:52.840 --> 50:55.100]  but are very much a part of day to day life.
[50:55.560 --> 50:58.080]  And I've been playing that game a lot. That's a really fun game.
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.860]  I was surprised by how tense it was for me.
[51:02.860 --> 51:07.780]  As somebody who had seen the movies, I think it's almost the best thing you could say about a licensed game,
[51:07.840 --> 51:11.400]  where it has changed my view of those films.
[51:11.840 --> 51:15.620]  It has made me so much more invested and feel so much more intense for the characters.
[51:16.740 --> 51:17.920]  It's tough to be quiet.
[51:18.280 --> 51:20.600]  Should we try a let's play in it?
[51:20.940 --> 51:21.560]  Oh, that'd be fun.
[51:22.080 --> 51:22.600]  Yeah, let's do it.
[51:22.740 --> 51:28.080]  It might be fun to kind of do what we did and have all of our Discord audio be coming through so we all have to be quiet.
[51:28.080 --> 51:31.640]  Well, the problem with it, I originally thought, oh, I'll do a let's play.
[51:31.780 --> 51:35.400]  But I ended up getting so into character, I just wasn't talking.
[51:35.940 --> 51:40.340]  Like, I was in a group call with some people while playing it, and I just could not speak.
[51:40.520 --> 51:42.200]  Because I was like, I gotta be fucking quiet.
[51:42.440 --> 51:43.780]  Even though it couldn't pick up my voice.
[51:43.940 --> 51:46.240]  To be fair, you did the same in Tombstone Tally.
[51:46.720 --> 51:48.260]  Well, we were all doing it in Tombstone.
[51:48.720 --> 51:52.520]  I like the idea that we could only really have conversations by waterfalls and stuff.
[51:54.000 --> 51:55.200]  With a little talk sound.
[51:55.720 --> 51:57.160]  A little hide and speak, if you will.
[51:57.160 --> 51:59.280]  I'm gonna share my screen for a minute.
[51:59.460 --> 52:01.520]  I have a clip from when I was playing it.
[52:01.760 --> 52:07.560]  I thought I was the smartest person in the world for a moment.
[52:08.380 --> 52:11.300]  And it went very much against me, so I'm sharing my screen.
[52:11.740 --> 52:13.280]  So you're trying to be sneaky.
[52:13.540 --> 52:17.540]  It is the whole thing of like, you're just trying to avoid these aliens as quiet as possible.
[52:18.080 --> 52:24.520]  And I was in a real bad situation where you have these moments where you get these planks.
[52:25.320 --> 52:26.480]  And you have to lay them down.
[52:26.480 --> 52:28.320]  This is the first time I'd used a plank.
[52:29.040 --> 52:34.020]  So the alien is following me around, to give context of this clip.
[52:34.280 --> 52:35.560]  And I'll explain it while I'm walking through.
[52:35.960 --> 52:37.040]  So I'm holding this plank.
[52:37.540 --> 52:38.920]  And the alien is close by.
[52:39.180 --> 52:41.260]  And I'm like, I just gotta get across here.
[52:41.400 --> 52:42.120]  And then I'll checkpoint.
[52:43.200 --> 52:43.940]  So I'm walking.
[52:44.500 --> 52:46.420]  And I see... I've never placed one before.
[52:46.500 --> 52:47.220]  I place it.
[52:47.540 --> 52:49.980]  You have to slowly do it so it doesn't make noise.
[52:50.060 --> 52:50.740]  It doesn't just thwomp.
[52:51.120 --> 52:53.300]  I turn around. The alien's right fucking there.
[52:53.480 --> 52:54.160]  And I'm like, oh god.
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.260]  And I thought you clicked A to go across.
[52:56.380 --> 52:57.620]  But that's how you reset it.
[52:57.680 --> 52:59.040]  So then I had to place it again.
[52:59.620 --> 53:01.480]  And I'm slowly bringing it down.
[53:01.780 --> 53:02.860]  And then I turn.
[53:03.380 --> 53:04.780]  And I'm like, I wanna move.
[53:04.860 --> 53:05.920]  But the alien's right there.
[53:06.040 --> 53:07.200]  And I make noise every step.
[53:07.240 --> 53:08.280]  What do I do? What do I fuck?
[53:08.480 --> 53:09.460]  Oh, he's looking at me!
[53:09.480 --> 53:11.060]  And I'm like, I'll just get on the beam.
[53:11.180 --> 53:12.840]  So that way he can't get me.
[53:13.280 --> 53:14.900]  I'm just gonna stand here.
[53:15.140 --> 53:17.180]  And I'll wait for him to leave while I just hang out on this beam.
[53:17.320 --> 53:18.360]  Oh, I fucking broke!
[53:19.180 --> 53:20.960]  You can't just stand on the beam.
[53:21.220 --> 53:21.800]  Is what I thought.
[53:22.100 --> 53:23.600]  The beam breaks.
[53:23.600 --> 53:24.620]  The beam breaks.
[53:24.800 --> 53:26.920]  Oh, what the fuck?
[53:27.940 --> 53:29.000]  It's... all of the...
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.360]  I was just clipping non-stop of me shitting myself playing this game.
[53:32.580 --> 53:34.380]  Every time I'd have an interaction.
[53:34.500 --> 53:35.460]  This is my first one.
[53:35.700 --> 53:37.360]  Where I'm just like walking through.
[53:37.800 --> 53:38.860]  Trying to be all sneaky.
[53:39.900 --> 53:41.120]  Just looking at my bar.
[53:41.220 --> 53:44.800]  You can see how much noise you're making in contrast to the world around you.
[53:44.820 --> 53:45.640]  And I'm like, okay.
[53:46.640 --> 53:47.580]  Everything's all good.
[53:47.720 --> 53:49.140]  And it's fucking right there.
[53:49.400 --> 53:50.360]  Oh my god!
[53:50.640 --> 53:51.600]  Holy shit.
[53:53.360 --> 53:54.420]  And it's just terrifying.
[53:54.620 --> 53:59.400]  Cause you know, like in the movie I never think about the idea of like, if you end up next to one of these things, what do you do?
[53:59.400 --> 54:00.500]  You're just kind of stuck.
[54:00.880 --> 54:02.080]  You can't move.
[54:02.640 --> 54:03.620]  Cause you make noise.
[54:03.920 --> 54:05.320]  Your lungs aren't looking good.
[54:05.480 --> 54:06.400]  No, it's real bad.
[54:06.580 --> 54:09.420]  You play as an asthmatic pregnant woman.
[54:09.520 --> 54:13.820]  Which is a deadly combo for a quiet place scenario.
[54:14.160 --> 54:14.840]  Just tiptoeing.
[54:15.160 --> 54:16.920]  But we're gonna have a...
[54:16.920 --> 54:19.440]  Almost like a things to do type thing coming out.
[54:19.460 --> 54:19.800]  For that.
[54:19.800 --> 54:21.320]  It'll be out by the time this comes out.
[54:21.660 --> 54:25.800]  If you want to see the video of that, the YouTube version will have it in.
[54:26.100 --> 54:26.400]  Yes.
[54:26.920 --> 54:27.540]  If you're listening.
[54:29.940 --> 54:31.360]  That's not the only gaming thing.
[54:31.640 --> 54:35.080]  Do you mind if I pivot to another gaming?
[54:35.080 --> 54:35.580]  Please do.
[54:36.140 --> 54:37.400]  Geoff, you were part of this.
[54:38.020 --> 54:38.280]  A little bit.
[54:38.280 --> 54:42.220]  I was playing Sea of Thieves.
[54:42.500 --> 54:43.500]  Having a good time.
[54:43.800 --> 54:44.720]  By myself.
[54:45.060 --> 54:45.700]  Just relaxing.
[54:45.900 --> 54:46.520]  Doing some chess.
[54:46.600 --> 54:48.180]  Getting up some loot and treasure.
[54:48.720 --> 54:51.200]  And I got boarded by two people.
[54:51.800 --> 54:52.280]  Who were dicks.
[54:52.580 --> 54:54.740]  And they just kept killing me over and over again.
[54:55.060 --> 54:57.200]  I noticed a ship on a different island.
[54:57.380 --> 54:58.300]  And I thought, I'll avoid that.
[54:58.340 --> 54:59.040]  I don't want to fight.
[54:59.540 --> 55:03.700]  They had, I guess, cannonballed or rowboated to where I was.
[55:03.760 --> 55:04.760]  And just hid in my boat.
[55:05.360 --> 55:07.880]  And then when I went to leave, they just started killing me.
[55:08.260 --> 55:12.280]  And their plan was to steer my boat back to their boat to sink me.
[55:12.380 --> 55:13.560]  And then steal all my stuff.
[55:14.180 --> 55:16.780]  But at the last minute, I killed them.
[55:16.780 --> 55:19.100]  And I took control of my boat again and I escaped.
[55:19.480 --> 55:22.600]  Then another ship showed up and started attacking them.
[55:23.160 --> 55:23.920]  Sunk them.
[55:24.220 --> 55:25.180]  And I thought, this is great.
[55:25.260 --> 55:27.320]  I can now just get rid of all my stuff and sell it.
[55:27.540 --> 55:30.500]  They happened to spawn in the path of where I needed to go.
[55:31.020 --> 55:32.420]  So then we started a whole new chase.
[55:32.780 --> 55:34.300]  And they were just trying to shoot me.
[55:34.400 --> 55:36.600]  They were clearly very experienced in this game.
[55:37.420 --> 55:39.200]  And so I pulled up my recent players.
[55:39.360 --> 55:40.400]  I recognized one of the names.
[55:41.260 --> 55:43.860]  And once again, great feature at Xbox.
[55:43.860 --> 55:46.620]  You can link your Twitch account to your profile.
[55:47.380 --> 55:49.700]  And if they do that, you can open their Twitch.
[55:50.220 --> 55:55.260]  And so I opened the Twitch and they were streaming their perspective of chasing me.
[55:55.660 --> 56:00.500]  And so I tweeted out, hey, these guys are chasing me.
[56:00.620 --> 56:02.320]  It's real. This isn't going great.
[56:02.880 --> 56:03.880]  Go watch if you want.
[56:04.540 --> 56:06.080]  And then their chat went from...
[56:06.380 --> 56:08.060]  They had two people in their stream.
[56:08.180 --> 56:10.560]  It was the guy who was streaming himself watching.
[56:10.820 --> 56:12.720]  And his friend who was playing with him watching.
[56:12.720 --> 56:15.500]  And they suddenly spiked to 100 viewers.
[56:15.720 --> 56:17.100]  And they didn't know why.
[56:17.680 --> 56:19.660]  And they started freaking out as to why.
[56:19.820 --> 56:22.420]  It was also very funny where I was messing with them.
[56:22.720 --> 56:25.740]  And he was the most upset streamer I've ever heard.
[56:25.820 --> 56:27.600]  He was cursing and like punching the wall.
[56:27.720 --> 56:30.140]  And be like, this is bullshit. This is the worst fucking thing.
[56:30.480 --> 56:31.900]  And then all these people showed up.
[56:31.960 --> 56:33.560]  And they were like, oh, hey, hey.
[56:33.560 --> 56:34.620]  Hey, there are people here.
[56:35.020 --> 56:37.320]  Whoa, I get raided by somebody.
[56:37.980 --> 56:39.380]  And they didn't know how to react.
[56:39.460 --> 56:40.780]  They were losing their minds about it.
[56:40.780 --> 56:42.860]  And the chat was so fucking funny.
[56:43.020 --> 56:45.840]  Where nobody was revealing where they came from.
[56:45.880 --> 56:48.800]  But they were making all sorts of references to the podcast.
[56:49.280 --> 56:50.840]  Like, this is a regulation stream.
[56:51.080 --> 56:51.940]  And all that type of thing.
[56:52.160 --> 56:55.480]  And they had no clue what was going on.
[56:56.160 --> 56:58.540]  And so I texted Gavin.
[56:58.900 --> 57:00.360]  Saying like, I need help.
[57:00.580 --> 57:02.320]  Because I was trying to accomplish something.
[57:02.900 --> 57:05.320]  And I really needed a second hand on deck.
[57:05.600 --> 57:08.960]  And I know Gavin has never had one of these moments in that game.
[57:08.960 --> 57:14.040]  So I thought, oh, it would be great to let Gavin see this side of this game that he hasn't seen before.
[57:14.560 --> 57:15.300]  Gavin was busy.
[57:15.880 --> 57:17.160]  So then I went to the Slack.
[57:17.260 --> 57:18.880]  And said, is anyone around?
[57:19.240 --> 57:21.340]  And Geoff was kind enough to hop on.
[57:21.580 --> 57:23.380]  And help with this getaway.
[57:24.540 --> 57:25.520]  Which was perfect.
[57:25.520 --> 57:29.040]  Because I did a thing that allowed me to go into a part of the map.
[57:29.160 --> 57:31.040]  That you can only go to if you do that thing.
[57:31.540 --> 57:35.040]  And they did not know that you had to manually activate it.
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.540]  So they went to swap over to do what I was doing.
[57:38.540 --> 57:40.320]  And it would not work for them.
[57:40.460 --> 57:41.740]  And so they got sunk.
[57:42.060 --> 57:43.440]  All while yelling about it.
[57:43.580 --> 57:45.540]  And it was great trolling.
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.700]  And then we had to try to escape.
[57:47.840 --> 57:49.580]  The problem when all the people joined.
[57:49.680 --> 57:52.160]  Is they became way more committed to sinking me.
[57:52.200 --> 57:53.720]  It was like, oh, they're never going to stop.
[57:53.900 --> 57:55.860]  They're just going to continue to chase.
[57:56.220 --> 57:59.160]  And so I said, Geoff, take the wheel and go west.
[57:59.440 --> 58:01.760]  And Geoff, there's no fault of your own.
[58:02.040 --> 58:04.760]  I did not know Geoff had never steered the boat before.
[58:04.760 --> 58:09.060]  So the first question Geoff said was, how do I tell which way is west?
[58:09.320 --> 58:12.420]  And there's a compass right next to the wheel that tells you what direction you're going in.
[58:12.420 --> 58:13.360]  Figured it out immediately.
[58:13.560 --> 58:16.640]  Yeah, he instantly figured it out after that and said, ignore me.
[58:17.280 --> 58:20.220]  And then you said, I think you misinterpreted the wind.
[58:20.800 --> 58:22.200]  It was a whole thing, but it was like, oh boy.
[58:22.520 --> 58:26.020]  We are, this is an unexperienced crew for this scenario.
[58:26.820 --> 58:27.580]  It's not great.
[58:28.200 --> 58:30.060]  How do you misinterpret the wind?
[58:30.480 --> 58:31.700]  I don't even know what he's talking about there.
[58:31.700 --> 58:35.240]  I don't, you said, like, how do I, I don't remember.
[58:35.840 --> 58:37.980]  It was a small detail, but it was, you, I think.
[58:38.060 --> 58:40.580]  So we, we on voice, we on voice chat talking?
[58:41.000 --> 58:41.580]  We were on Discord.
[58:41.880 --> 58:44.120]  Yeah, we were on, no, yeah, we're talking back and forth.
[58:44.220 --> 58:47.300]  And I sent Geoff a link to the stream so he could hear what they were saying.
[58:48.100 --> 58:50.340]  They wanted me banned for stream sniping.
[58:51.120 --> 58:55.360]  They were not, because I was in their chat saying like, hey, maybe you should let this guy go.
[58:55.940 --> 58:57.200]  Maybe this isn't worth it.
[58:58.260 --> 58:59.800]  Maybe you should just let them escape.
[59:00.180 --> 59:01.580]  They eventually killed us.
[59:01.700 --> 59:03.060]  They eventually, yeah.
[59:03.720 --> 59:07.820]  We did not, we did not last long beyond sinking them in that one instance.
[59:08.080 --> 59:15.320]  I'm not much help in a fight in a game I haven't played since the last time we recorded in it, which would have been before Rooster Teeth went under, I think.
[59:15.900 --> 59:18.540]  I think I'm the same way, though, you know, I don't think I've ever driven the boat.
[59:19.180 --> 59:23.060]  I just never considered it. It was very funny to be like, okay, Geoff, you take the wheel.
[59:23.060 --> 59:28.380]  I was weird. I was like, I've literally never, I mean, surely I have for like one second before.
[59:28.580 --> 59:32.360]  But whenever I play with the Burndog and Antonio, Antonio is always the captain.
[59:32.520 --> 59:35.480]  And whenever I play with y'all, Andrew's always the captain.
[59:35.540 --> 59:36.700]  So I just never come up.
[59:37.500 --> 59:44.480]  Yeah, it's funny, but it was so, I think it's the thing I'm going to do whenever anybody's chasing me and I notice they happen to be streaming.
[59:44.940 --> 59:48.000]  Because it's so funny to see the reaction change and how they adjust.
[59:48.280 --> 59:51.480]  I was hoping it would kind of throw them off, which it did initially.
[59:53.360 --> 59:55.240]  But that was great. It was a lot of fun.
[59:55.420 --> 59:58.400]  After you messaged me, I reinstalled Sea of Thieves.
[59:58.960 --> 59:59.220]  Great.
[59:59.320 --> 01:00:04.460]  Just in case I was able to jump in again. And then today, Call of Duty needed like a 300 gig update.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:05.240]  So I deleted it.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:09.720]  Dude, I wish you wouldn't. They just released a big update to Sea of Thieves that we should play.
[01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.860]  I need to get a bigger storage.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.420]  How do you shit on us for not having a bigger storage?
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.220]  You're constantly shitting on us for not having enough space.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.580]  What a great turn near the end of the episode that this just took. This is fantastic.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:26.340]  I just went out and bought a two terabyte fucking drive because Gavin shit on me in an episode like three weeks ago.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.180]  Mine's one terabyte, but I had to delete Fallout.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.060]  Well, we're not going to use Fallout. That's fine.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.580]  Yeah, and Sea of Thieves.
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:34.800]  Reinstall Sea of Thieves.
[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.680]  I just need more time to properly consider what to delete. I just did it quickly because we were going to play.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:41.260]  I understand.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.240]  But they just released like a trolling update, which is cool.
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:51.700]  They did, but this man always shitting on us deleting stuff. He's deleting stuff. He's just quietly deleting.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:58.360]  Well, I couldn't exactly be... I'm going to get a bigger storage, but that wouldn't help me today when we needed to play the other game.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.040]  Interesting.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.480]  I feel like that wouldn't fly if you were on the other end of this conversation right now.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:05.340]  Interesting.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:12.860]  I feel like that wouldn't be good enough. I feel like Gavin would hit back with a, but we need the space today. Or one of those.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.240]  Snarky comments.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.640]  It's a portable drive.
[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:24.600]  I may have snarked it. I think it's also a bit of a bummer that, you know, if you upgrade from one terabyte to two terabytes, you can't... it's not three. You just have two of them.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.900]  You have to take out the one and then...
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.120]  It really does suck.
[01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.000]  I agree.
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.440]  Oh, got a voice memo, I think.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:32.380]  Oh, you did?
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.900]  Hey man, I think they got you on this one. Sorry.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.720]  No, I was just agreeing with you guys and letting Gavin know that he got got.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.120]  Oh, can I leave voice memos on Slack? Yeah, I can.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.720]  Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.760]  Are you guys getting in a huddle?
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.880]  Oh, no, that's a whole other thing. I love to huddle up, though. Great music in the huddle.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.260]  Andrew made a voice. Oh, can I play this?
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.560]  I mean, it's just what I said, but yeah, you heard the memo.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.620]  Can I leave voice memos on Slack? Yeah, I can.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:03.460]  Oh, I see.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:11.100]  I was just testing. I think this is... we're getting in the voice memo territory and I'm very excited about it.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:13.760]  Is this our voice memo era? I think so.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.540]  Can we leave voice memos on Discord for the Falcons?
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.960]  Could we? Could we?
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:26.400]  I don't know. I feel like we could just go into the channel right now and then finish the episode out over there.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:29.200]  And that would be something. But that's all I could really think of.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.620]  Message Eric Badour. Don't message Eric Badour.
[01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.060]  Wrap up episode instead of message Eric Badour.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.440]  I don't think I can send a voice memo.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:42.320]  Yeah, congratulations on making it a quarter of a century, guys.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.880]  25 episodes of Regulation Podcast.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.480]  It seems like just yesterday that we ended F*** Face at episode 206? 207? Whatever it was.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.380]  What did... what was it?
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:54.740]  206.
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.020]  Yeah, but it was our...
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:56.100]  206?
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.120]  It was... 206 would have been our 205th episode. Is that right?
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.740]  So we did one episode for every bone in the body.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.640]  Which was exactly how we planned it out.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.340]  And thank you for finally revealing the true secret of F*** Face.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.300]  It was only designed to go as many episodes as we have bones in a body.
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:18.660]  How are we going to end Regulation?
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.560]  Hopefully we have more than 180-odd episodes or so to go.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.280]  We're going to have to get some new bones.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:30.120]  Speaking of getting new bones, you guys should go get a t-shirt over at TheRegulationStore.com.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:36.260]  Or if buying a t-shirt's not your thing, maybe go check out our Patreon over at...
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:41.400]  Well, you know what? Just go to Regulatrion.com or Geoff.sucks and that'll answer all your questions.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:46.600]  And have a good day. Or night. I don't know what time... I don't even know when you're listening to this.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.320]  But if it's evening, have a good evening. If it's in the morning, have a good day.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.120]  That was a fantastic outro. Yeah, I just had a quick question for Eric and Gavin before we wrapped up.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.740]  Did you guys have hot dog paranoia last night? Because the hot dog counters were flying.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.500]  I never have hot dog paranoia, no. It's not a competition.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.480]  I'm just on one dog, so I just look at the nice pictures.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:12.280]  It's true, Geoff takes great photos. I take a photo of every hot dog I eat.
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.820]  Bye! Bye!
