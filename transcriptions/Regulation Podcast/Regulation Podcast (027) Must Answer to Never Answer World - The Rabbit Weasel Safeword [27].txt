[00:00.000 --> 00:07.620]  Attention! This is a regulation announcement from the current timeline. It is today. I am speaking
[00:07.620 --> 00:13.520]  to you from today. Not from the future. Not from the past. I have very important news to you
[00:13.520 --> 00:19.000]  because coming soon on what day, Gavin? Friday, November 22nd!
[00:20.560 --> 00:27.600]  That's right, Andrew! Friday, November 22nd at... checking my watch... noon central time,
[00:27.600 --> 00:36.420]  it becomes Gerb Friday. We release the Gurpler to the world via our store. Gavin?
[00:37.760 --> 00:45.920]  Regulationstore.com or regulationstore.store. The first ever regulation Gurpler. After you've
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.760]  bought one, pop on over to Twitch. Why is that, Andrew? Because we'll be streaming Mario Party
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.740]  at noon central. The return of Dilkong. The rematch. And if you don't know what that address
[00:58.740 --> 01:04.920]  is, I do! And I'm prepared to share it with you. It's RegulationPod. Now. At Twitch. Twitch.tv
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.840]  slash TheRegulationPod. He said RegulationPod at Twitch. He said it wrong. He said it wrong.
[01:11.040 --> 01:18.420]  Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod. This ends your regulation announcement. Thank you for your ears.
[01:18.420 --> 01:22.420]  Clearly the website is not RegulationPod for where we're streaming.
[01:25.400 --> 01:29.300]  Kick exists. There's all sorts of platforms out there. You gotta let them know. It's at Twitch.
[01:29.940 --> 01:36.860]  At Twitch. What? What would you call it? Twitch.tv slash TheRegulationPod.
[01:37.240 --> 01:41.800]  If you say at, it means it's like a handle or an email address. Yeah. No, it's also a word.
[01:45.020 --> 01:50.180]  That's not my fucking problem. You're thinking about cyber stuff. For real, this is the end of
[01:50.180 --> 01:55.600]  the announcement. We now return you to your regularly scheduled current timeline programming.
[01:56.540 --> 02:02.100]  Gavin, make the noise. Time is flat circle. Hello and welcome to another episode of The
[02:02.100 --> 02:06.680]  Regulation Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton,
[02:06.680 --> 02:15.360]  Gavin Free, Eric Baudour. This is episode 27. I feel like 27 is such an unspecial number.
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.920]  Really? Yeah. I like 27 as a number. What would you say the least special number is?
[02:22.180 --> 02:25.460]  I don't know. I just don't think anyone would ever celebrate the 27th of something.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.160]  What day is your birthday, Gavin? 23rd. 23rd. Unmemorable, I think.
[02:30.660 --> 02:34.680]  Does anybody remember their 27th birthday? Oh, what was I doing?
[02:35.980 --> 02:41.720]  Oh, probably playing Minecraft. No, absolutely not. I don't.
[02:41.900 --> 02:46.800]  Absolutely no clue. No idea. No clue. But 27 is the 27 club.
[02:47.300 --> 02:50.620]  Just a bunch of famous people who die at 27. That's what I think of.
[02:50.760 --> 02:54.340]  You know, I almost did an episode of Soul Ride about that 27 club because people kept asking
[02:54.340 --> 02:57.920]  me to do it. And the more you look into it, there really aren't that a higher number of people that
[02:57.920 --> 03:02.260]  die at 27 at all. I did. I was contrasting it. I don't know why I never released it,
[03:02.260 --> 03:07.480]  but I did a 27 versus a 49 club. And there are a lot of people that die at 49. Way more
[03:07.480 --> 03:11.300]  celebrities died at 49 than 27, which still seems too young, too young to me.
[03:11.700 --> 03:14.060]  Maybe we need to do a draft where there's just years
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.280]  and you have to put a celebrity who died at that age.
[03:21.560 --> 03:22.360]  What? What?
[03:24.220 --> 03:27.980]  You can't also say what. You would have to explain what you mean.
[03:28.740 --> 03:32.600]  I just really I've really been enjoying the drafts. I'm trying to make everything a draft,
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.340]  but that doesn't really fit. Dogs and Cream is a new weird level for us.
[03:37.560 --> 03:40.720]  Dogs and Cream was our first double draft, and I think it went very well.
[03:40.820 --> 03:41.680]  It was so much fun.
[03:41.960 --> 03:45.740]  Whereas the kicker, picker, repicker was an absolute calamity
[03:46.480 --> 03:49.080]  and maybe the craziest thing we've ever made.
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.240]  So that that has come out now as of this recording or of this release, right? Yeah.
[03:54.240 --> 03:59.440]  I am so interested to see what the audience's take on that is,
[03:59.460 --> 04:02.100]  because I felt like in the moment we were creating something
[04:02.100 --> 04:06.280]  that we were going to be stuck with forever, potentially in this wheel.
[04:06.520 --> 04:09.080]  But then it was because we're recording so far in advance.
[04:09.200 --> 04:11.480]  We all forgot about it and went back about our lives.
[04:11.480 --> 04:13.520]  And now the audience is going to get it dropped on them.
[04:13.520 --> 04:15.220]  And I assume it'll be dropped on us again, too.
[04:15.560 --> 04:16.080]  You know what I mean?
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.600]  I haven't stopped thinking about it. The moving on thing is not a thing I did.
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.780]  It's a funny recording because you start out not into it,
[04:24.840 --> 04:27.800]  Geoff, in the sense that you're just like, this is what are we doing like this?
[04:27.880 --> 04:29.840]  What? And then there's a shift that happens,
[04:29.840 --> 04:32.660]  maybe halfway where everybody gets all in on the wheel.
[04:33.020 --> 04:36.580]  And it is what you you bringing in just the concept of stealing
[04:36.580 --> 04:38.440]  of the players was absolutely insane.
[04:40.260 --> 04:42.500]  It totally changed the entire game.
[04:42.780 --> 04:47.480]  Yes. My flip was was accepting that this isn't going to be a contest
[04:47.480 --> 04:50.160]  where we genuinely pick the best players
[04:50.160 --> 04:52.100]  and then the person with the best selections wins.
[04:52.320 --> 04:57.020]  Because once we break the seal on theft, then it's just out the window.
[04:57.160 --> 04:59.460]  So when I was able to reframe that in my head and go like,
[04:59.500 --> 05:02.680]  oh, OK, it's nonsense. Just lean into the nonsense.
[05:02.920 --> 05:05.360]  Then the wheel became the most entertaining thing on earth to me.
[05:05.940 --> 05:09.940]  As a big reality show fan, I thought you would appreciate the midseason twist, Geoff.
[05:10.240 --> 05:10.840]  I was shocked.
[05:11.460 --> 05:12.300]  Why weren't we there?
[05:12.540 --> 05:15.120]  Why weren't we out there stealing each other's movies then this summer?
[05:15.120 --> 05:16.860]  Because that that's not that game.
[05:16.960 --> 05:18.180]  It's a different game, right?
[05:18.420 --> 05:19.600]  That's a completely different game.
[05:19.980 --> 05:20.740]  Understand the difference.
[05:20.900 --> 05:23.260]  That's like Gavin, you're playing chess and saying like,
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.980]  why don't I have a get out of jail free card?
[05:25.100 --> 05:26.360]  It's a different game, dude.
[05:27.360 --> 05:28.080]  Completely unique.
[05:28.300 --> 05:28.900]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[05:28.900 --> 05:31.580]  All you have to do, Gavin, is introduce a new rule
[05:31.580 --> 05:34.940]  for get out of jail free cards for chess and then you're good.
[05:35.280 --> 05:36.700]  Halfway through the chess season.
[05:37.040 --> 05:40.060]  Yeah. Should we all should we all pick a classic game
[05:40.060 --> 05:42.440]  and come up with one new rule for it?
[05:42.560 --> 05:43.580]  And then we have to play.
[05:44.220 --> 05:44.800]  That's fun.
[05:45.100 --> 05:46.620]  I love that idea.
[05:47.920 --> 05:49.560]  What do you mean by like a board game?
[05:49.620 --> 05:50.920]  Is that what you mean by classic game or?
[05:51.040 --> 05:53.120]  Yeah, like, for example, you might be able to get Monopoly
[05:53.120 --> 05:56.400]  and your new rule might be that one person has a gun.
[05:57.400 --> 05:58.860]  How does that change Monopoly?
[05:58.860 --> 06:00.040]  I don't know. However you want.
[06:00.660 --> 06:02.520]  Well, no, you do have to know it's your rule.
[06:02.760 --> 06:04.040]  What do you mean? You have to know.
[06:04.120 --> 06:04.720]  Well, it's your rule.
[06:05.140 --> 06:05.880]  It's my rule.
[06:06.240 --> 06:08.260]  My rule is that people have a gun in Monopoly.
[06:08.520 --> 06:09.620]  You're assigning this to me.
[06:10.060 --> 06:10.980]  I was just throwing out something.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.620]  I just I feel like you're playing Monopoly in a more intimidating way with your throw out.
[06:16.680 --> 06:21.100]  This is Gavin has presented like two ideas in this episode.
[06:21.260 --> 06:25.600]  At both times, it feels like he ends the idea and then just goes, what?
[06:27.300 --> 06:31.520]  Yeah, it's like he wants deer hunter, but in front of a Monopoly board instead.
[06:31.920 --> 06:35.540]  On the night, I would put more than three seconds thought into it.
[06:35.540 --> 06:37.840]  But, you know, just any classic game modified.
[06:38.860 --> 06:42.780]  You know, it's actually it's actually funny you say this, Gavin,
[06:42.860 --> 06:44.460]  because I had written down on my notes.
[06:44.480 --> 06:47.620]  And I think where you're going with this, I've seen it early in this episode.
[06:47.700 --> 06:50.940]  Now, you seem to have this this desire to create right now.
[06:50.960 --> 06:56.160]  You're trying to build games out of the ether right now in the moment without any thought or
[06:56.160 --> 07:00.940]  preparation. I have been in a similar mode where I've been writing down supplemental ideas for
[07:00.940 --> 07:02.720]  shows that are like not all the way there.
[07:02.740 --> 07:04.960]  And I was going to pitch to you guys today a couple of things.
[07:05.280 --> 07:08.140]  One, I was going to say, I think it's time for us to do a sausage talk.
[07:08.260 --> 07:10.560]  We should probably put that on the books and record a sausage talk pretty soon
[07:10.560 --> 07:11.940]  before we get to the end of the year.
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.700]  But the other one is maybe we should have a supplemental game idea pitch session.
[07:17.400 --> 07:21.820]  OK, where we all bring like two or three game ideas that aren't fully baked or that are.
[07:21.960 --> 07:24.700]  And then we pitch them to each other and then we, I don't know,
[07:24.780 --> 07:26.560]  vote on them and see if any of them we want to make.
[07:26.960 --> 07:27.940]  Yeah, I like it.
[07:27.960 --> 07:29.640]  I like that whiteboard session we did,
[07:29.700 --> 07:33.280]  but a little more focused and with the intent of releasing it to the audience.
[07:33.280 --> 07:35.360]  Now we don't own the whiteboard.
[07:36.480 --> 07:38.020]  It's true, but we own all the ideas.
[07:38.300 --> 07:38.680]  That's true.
[07:38.900 --> 07:39.340]  We bought those.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.600]  Did we forget to claim it in the IP transition?
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.300]  I should have put that whiteboard on the list.
[07:43.300 --> 07:45.760]  We should have put the whiteboard on the list of things we now own.
[07:45.940 --> 07:48.260]  I claimed the photo of the whiteboard and I still have that.
[07:48.460 --> 07:50.020]  Oh, OK, good. That's great.
[07:51.080 --> 07:53.420]  I'm still thinking about how to like switch games up.
[07:53.660 --> 07:56.040]  And I can't get past Monopoly, but with a gun.
[07:57.120 --> 08:00.500]  Can you imagine opening a box of Monopoly and just seeing a gun in there and be like,
[08:00.580 --> 08:01.000]  what?
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.840]  It's just like you got the chance cards.
[08:02.940 --> 08:03.860]  You got the community chest.
[08:03.940 --> 08:04.620]  You got a Glock.
[08:05.680 --> 08:07.720]  Oh, the chance cards really put a dark turn.
[08:07.800 --> 08:10.240]  If you had a chance card and a gun in a box.
[08:11.900 --> 08:13.920]  That feels like a go places.
[08:14.540 --> 08:17.680]  You imagine like a fun family game and you pull a chance card.
[08:17.800 --> 08:19.740]  It's just like shoot somebody at the table.
[08:22.980 --> 08:25.680]  The stakes do not equal the level of game.
[08:25.940 --> 08:26.960]  What are you doing Hasbro?
[08:29.320 --> 08:29.680]  Gun.
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.900]  A gun in Monopoly.
[08:32.220 --> 08:36.060]  I was when you were bringing it up, I was thinking like, oh, maybe if you roll like
[08:36.060 --> 08:40.120]  a nine, you have to give money to a player or something.
[08:40.240 --> 08:41.140]  You're just like, well, a gun.
[08:41.280 --> 08:41.940]  What about guns?
[08:42.120 --> 08:45.080]  What if you have a gun, but it only fires immunity bullets?
[08:45.580 --> 08:46.900]  I got a great idea for a game.
[08:46.960 --> 08:49.020]  Let's play snakes and ladders, but with a grenade.
[08:49.240 --> 08:50.420]  Let's put a grenade in the box.
[08:50.640 --> 08:53.040]  Let's play snakes and ladders, but with real snakes.
[08:53.180 --> 08:54.300]  But fake ladders.
[08:57.140 --> 09:00.700]  Like you have to climb the ladder to escape the snakes, but the ladder doesn't work.
[09:00.760 --> 09:01.340]  It's not real.
[09:01.680 --> 09:04.560]  The ladders are inflatable and the snakes can bite them and pop them.
[09:04.820 --> 09:05.740]  It's a slippy ladder.
[09:06.080 --> 09:07.280]  I like chutes and ladders.
[09:08.580 --> 09:11.840]  But that's like a weird where you want to like slide down the slide.
[09:12.080 --> 09:12.920]  That just it's fun.
[09:13.240 --> 09:14.660]  You want the negative thing to happen.
[09:15.780 --> 09:16.340]  It's a weird frame.
[09:16.580 --> 09:17.560]  Chutes and ladders.
[09:17.620 --> 09:18.140]  Here's my game.
[09:18.240 --> 09:19.000]  Chutes and ladders.
[09:19.160 --> 09:21.040]  But one of the ladders and it's random.
[09:21.140 --> 09:22.440]  Each game is sandpaper.
[09:25.440 --> 09:26.240]  Sandpaper ladders.
[09:26.820 --> 09:27.200]  Terrible.
[09:27.600 --> 09:27.760]  Yeah.
[09:28.180 --> 09:30.900]  You got to slide down sandpaper or climb up sandpaper.
[09:31.020 --> 09:33.060]  So you're just like bleeding out for the rest of the game.
[09:33.160 --> 09:34.400]  Yeah, that's that's my rule.
[09:34.460 --> 09:34.840]  I don't know.
[09:35.380 --> 09:36.080]  Oh, man.
[09:36.680 --> 09:37.340]  That's hmm.
[09:37.680 --> 09:41.560]  I feel like Eric is at the biggest disadvantage with this game being someone who hates games.
[09:41.780 --> 09:47.400]  I have been so silent on this because I hate all of like I just my rule would be we don't
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.440]  have to play the game.
[09:48.520 --> 09:52.260]  That's that's what I was about to say as Eric's tricky rule is monopoly.
[09:52.260 --> 09:56.860]  But if anyone rules a one through five game instantly ends.
[09:57.300 --> 09:58.240]  Yeah, I don't.
[09:58.300 --> 09:59.040]  I just don't.
[10:01.160 --> 10:06.840]  Imagine checkers, but every piece is one of those little rubber domes that you thumb up the bottom
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.020]  and then you have to put them down and they could fly up in the air at any moment.
[10:11.560 --> 10:12.700]  I just don't want it.
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.800]  Like my rule is don't bother setting up the board.
[10:15.200 --> 10:17.940]  Yeah, Eric's is like it's checkers, but I don't play.
[10:18.180 --> 10:18.860]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:19.020 --> 10:19.560]  You guys go.
[10:19.640 --> 10:21.440]  Yeah, it's checkers, but you guys go nuts.
[10:21.440 --> 10:23.260]  And the box is just a TV remote.
[10:23.400 --> 10:26.660]  And then you just watch it put on Netflix.
[10:28.380 --> 10:30.540]  I just I just that's not how I want to.
[10:30.600 --> 10:33.300]  I just don't want to spend my time playing a board game.
[10:33.380 --> 10:33.780]  I just don't.
[10:33.920 --> 10:35.480]  What about a wrestling board game?
[10:35.840 --> 10:39.780]  I don't that doesn't add a layer to anything for me.
[10:39.860 --> 10:42.600]  That's just that's just also a thing that I like.
[10:42.620 --> 10:45.900]  But I don't like board games so much that I don't care.
[10:46.060 --> 10:46.780]  I just don't want it.
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.640]  What about a wrestling trivia game?
[10:49.160 --> 10:50.860]  No, I don't want to play a game.
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.920]  What about Monopoly?
[10:52.260 --> 10:54.660]  But one of the chance cards says cut a promo.
[10:55.000 --> 10:55.620]  What about that?
[10:56.040 --> 10:56.960]  What about that?
[10:57.200 --> 10:58.060]  I'm not sure.
[10:58.260 --> 11:00.680]  Geoff, do you understand that I don't like board games?
[11:00.760 --> 11:01.720]  It seems like they're going.
[11:01.840 --> 11:03.800]  But what about these things that are board games?
[11:03.940 --> 11:06.480]  Hey, Eric, why don't we what about what about checkers?
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.440]  But we call the teams baby faces and heels.
[11:12.520 --> 11:13.320]  This sucks.
[11:13.600 --> 11:14.660]  Baby faces go first.
[11:14.780 --> 11:17.860]  I hate I don't like I just don't like board games.
[11:17.860 --> 11:18.720]  I don't know what to tell you, Eric.
[11:18.760 --> 11:20.420]  Once they get going, there's no stopping them.
[11:20.420 --> 11:21.920]  You just got to let them get tuckered out.
[11:22.020 --> 11:25.220]  What about real life rat maze with gambling?
[11:26.340 --> 11:28.540]  Real life rat maze?
[11:28.880 --> 11:30.780]  There's a there's a different there's a yellow rat.
[11:30.860 --> 11:32.160]  There's a blue rat, red rat.
[11:32.420 --> 11:37.520]  And then they'll start in the middle and they have to get out for the red rat.
[11:37.760 --> 11:38.940]  Do you guys know what this is?
[11:39.420 --> 11:41.360]  No, I just thought he was doing like a mouse trap thing.
[11:41.700 --> 11:46.400]  What about Gavin gets a mouse hole and we do real life mouse trap at his house?
[11:47.220 --> 11:50.880]  Gavin's Gavin's mouse hole has spawned so many people posting pictures of mouse holes.
[11:51.660 --> 11:52.320]  It's great.
[11:52.620 --> 11:53.760]  I haven't seen the comments yet on that.
[11:53.940 --> 11:56.920]  Am I pretty alone in not understanding the origin of mouse holes?
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.740]  Yeah, I don't think there's anyone going like I also thought this.
[12:00.840 --> 12:03.920]  It's just people posting pictures of going look at my mouse hole.
[12:04.200 --> 12:04.960]  It's just mostly that.
[12:05.300 --> 12:10.160]  You know, it'd be fun if we had a wall and we made like seven different style mouse holes
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.880]  and then we released a couple of mice into the room and see which one they prefer.
[12:14.260 --> 12:15.900]  It was like a mouse hole showroom.
[12:16.540 --> 12:18.180]  Like a mouse hole showroom.
[12:18.360 --> 12:22.320]  And then we can see like which because we're all we were having a lot of opinions about
[12:22.320 --> 12:25.740]  mouse holes as humans who are never going to use it as a door.
[12:25.880 --> 12:26.680]  But a mouse will.
[12:26.800 --> 12:27.520]  It's their thoroughfare.
[12:27.640 --> 12:29.180]  I'd be interested to see what the mouse picks.
[12:29.820 --> 12:34.980]  I actually need to cut open one of my walls because I dropped I dropped something in it.
[12:35.380 --> 12:35.980]  What did you drop?
[12:36.240 --> 12:38.460]  Yeah, that was that was so intentionally vague.
[12:38.540 --> 12:39.120]  What did you drop?
[12:39.540 --> 12:40.600]  I was trying to remember what it was.
[12:40.600 --> 12:45.440]  I think it was like, you know, those, you know, those like, uh, magnetic.
[12:48.680 --> 12:49.780]  There's something in this wall.
[12:49.940 --> 12:50.060]  What?
[12:50.200 --> 12:50.620]  I don't know.
[12:51.320 --> 12:54.940]  It was one of those things on the outside of the wall in my hand was a magnetic roller.
[12:55.340 --> 13:00.140]  And I think I was trying to snake a wire up the wall because you tie the magnet to the
[13:00.140 --> 13:02.240]  wire on the inside and then you roll out the wall.
[13:02.300 --> 13:05.520]  It's a way to like snake upwards to a specific spot.
[13:05.520 --> 13:10.720]  Anyway, I, uh, I pulled the roller away from the wall too far and it just fell into the
[13:10.720 --> 13:10.900]  wall.
[13:11.200 --> 13:13.060]  And now it's like behind the skirting board.
[13:13.140 --> 13:14.940]  So the magnetism doesn't.
[13:15.040 --> 13:15.840]  It's not strong enough.
[13:16.360 --> 13:16.540]  Yeah.
[13:16.680 --> 13:17.740]  So I have to cut the wall open.
[13:18.200 --> 13:20.240]  Or we could get a stronger magnet.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.200]  Oh, dude, that might be the plan.
[13:23.320 --> 13:28.760]  Like one of those big Looney Tunes cartoon U shaped magnets that you have to hold with
[13:28.760 --> 13:29.520]  two hands.
[13:29.720 --> 13:32.000]  Because I don't I don't actually need the thing.
[13:32.500 --> 13:35.000]  I'm not desperate to get the thing out, but it was like $150.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.080]  And if I need to use it again, I don't want to buy it again.
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.460]  What is the most powerful magnet you can buy and hold?
[13:43.060 --> 13:43.940]  Like a permanent magnet?
[13:44.140 --> 13:45.540]  That is that is the second.
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.980]  When you go to search it in Google, most powerful magnet is first.
[13:50.160 --> 13:53.180]  And then most powerful magnet you can buy is second.
[13:56.800 --> 13:58.800]  I've never considered this.
[13:59.020 --> 14:01.620]  I we need to we need to explore powerful magnets.
[14:01.820 --> 14:01.960]  Yeah.
[14:01.960 --> 14:06.260]  Everyone when you go on like I just figured Reddit would be someone going like, oh, dude,
[14:06.280 --> 14:06.840]  it's this one.
[14:06.960 --> 14:08.360]  It's just a bunch of people going.
[14:08.500 --> 14:09.820]  My first question is why?
[14:10.100 --> 14:11.680]  And it's like, don't worry about why.
[14:12.300 --> 14:16.100]  Are we just retreading old insane clown posse territory at this point?
[14:16.100 --> 14:16.860]  Whoop whoop, dude.
[14:17.240 --> 14:17.640]  Absolutely.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.400]  Dude, we got to get some strong magnets.
[14:20.500 --> 14:20.720]  I'm excited.
[14:20.840 --> 14:22.840]  I do like Faygo now that I'm pro Michigan.
[14:23.560 --> 14:25.260]  Dude, I Faygo sucks.
[14:25.600 --> 14:26.080]  It's all right.
[14:26.180 --> 14:26.680]  It's totally fine.
[14:28.240 --> 14:28.980]  Totally fine.
[14:28.980 --> 14:30.800]  OK, what about hide and seek?
[14:30.880 --> 14:36.940]  But the seeker is blindfolded with a giant magnet and the hiders are all wearing armor.
[14:37.380 --> 14:39.600]  Yeah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[14:39.600 --> 14:40.440]  I love this.
[14:40.580 --> 14:43.440]  I love magnetic hide and seek.
[14:44.660 --> 14:47.820]  This is this is a jackass bit and it rocks.
[14:48.160 --> 14:49.640]  Yeah, this is a great idea.
[14:49.740 --> 14:50.100]  Magnet.
[14:50.160 --> 14:50.880]  I'm going to write that down.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.280]  Magnetic hide and seek.
[14:55.360 --> 15:00.080]  And then if if the seeker finds you and you get stuck to the seeker,
[15:00.140 --> 15:05.280]  then the person who gets stuck has to then have their own magnet and they become the seeker.
[15:05.300 --> 15:06.200]  Yeah, swap.
[15:06.380 --> 15:07.360]  You just build a chain.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.380]  You just build a chain of people.
[15:09.600 --> 15:09.940]  This is great.
[15:10.120 --> 15:10.840]  I love this.
[15:11.320 --> 15:12.080]  I'm excited.
[15:12.480 --> 15:17.480]  This is a preview of our upcoming supplemental episode,
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.340]  The Show Pitch, where everybody from Regulation pitches wild, crazy magnetic ideas,
[15:23.460 --> 15:25.500]  maybe some more magnetic than others.
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.800]  And then we we work through and we workshop them in front of you, the audience,
[15:31.120 --> 15:32.400]  via the supplemental content.
[15:32.540 --> 15:33.900]  And then maybe someday we'll make it.
[15:34.060 --> 15:37.040]  It'll be in your inbox soon.
[15:37.540 --> 15:39.880]  Imagine, yeah, imagine a show where we have to pitch to the Falcons.
[15:40.180 --> 15:40.820]  Oh, that's fun.
[15:41.120 --> 15:41.980]  Oh, Falcon pitch.
[15:45.280 --> 15:49.340]  It's like Falcon Crest, but with probably less big hair.
[15:50.720 --> 15:51.440]  I, uh.
[15:52.260 --> 15:53.000]  Oh, what was I?
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.740]  Fuck, it's gone.
[15:54.840 --> 15:55.360]  Never mind.
[15:56.000 --> 15:57.340]  I had it and it was gone.
[15:57.640 --> 16:00.580]  I was just going to hang on to these ideas in case for some reason next year,
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.840]  we like get a sponsor and they go,
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.980]  you guys have any like video ideas that's like outside of the realm of like the podcast?
[16:06.060 --> 16:07.900]  And I go, I got magnetic hide and seek.
[16:08.100 --> 16:09.620]  And they go, here you go.
[16:10.220 --> 16:11.740]  Here's $13,000.
[16:12.040 --> 16:12.840]  And you go, fantastic.
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.560]  I got a life hack I want to hit you guys with at some point today.
[16:16.220 --> 16:17.080]  Oh, hell yeah.
[16:18.220 --> 16:19.140]  What's your life hack?
[16:19.200 --> 16:19.820]  I want to hear it.
[16:19.840 --> 16:20.100]  All right.
[16:20.140 --> 16:20.960]  Well, I'll tell you.
[16:21.020 --> 16:24.500]  So, uh, if you've been living under a rock or in a different country, uh, lately,
[16:24.520 --> 16:29.180]  you'll know that, uh, America just went through an election, a fairly tumultuous election.
[16:29.260 --> 16:36.080]  And I consider our little, our little podcast space to be, uh, a safe haven, uh, from,
[16:36.240 --> 16:38.120]  from the larger problems of the world.
[16:38.120 --> 16:42.360]  You know, we're just here to be done and put our fingers in each other's butts metaphorically,
[16:42.780 --> 16:47.840]  you know, and, uh, and so I've been, uh, I've been feeling a little bit of the stress
[16:47.840 --> 16:50.900]  from just like the constant 24 hour news cycle.
[16:50.940 --> 16:52.000]  And I've been trying to get away from it.
[16:52.060 --> 16:56.220]  So I've developed a new way of living, not a life hack really, but I do have a life hack
[16:56.220 --> 16:56.980]  on the back end of it.
[16:57.020 --> 16:59.740]  The first thing it's, it's akin to shit shades, right?
[17:00.080 --> 17:03.380]  Just a way to enhance your experience a little bit better.
[17:03.560 --> 17:07.080]  Yesterday I went to Home Depot and I was just feeling kind of in the dumps about the whole
[17:07.080 --> 17:07.380]  thing.
[17:07.740 --> 17:12.320]  And so I don't know why, but I just grabbed my headphones, my AirPods, and I put them
[17:12.320 --> 17:16.320]  in and I just walked around Home Depot listening to music and my soundtrack.
[17:16.500 --> 17:17.920]  And I was so happy.
[17:18.120 --> 17:22.320]  I thought I'm going to become a headphones in at all times in public eye.
[17:22.440 --> 17:26.180]  I think that that's going to stick where window down while I'm driving didn't.
[17:26.200 --> 17:29.700]  And the cool thing about it is you can create a soundtrack to your life, right?
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.820]  And nobody knows what it is, but you can also play songs that make fun of people that you
[17:33.820 --> 17:34.220]  see.
[17:34.320 --> 17:35.680]  You could listen to podcasts.
[17:36.020 --> 17:39.660]  You could just have quiet and pretend like you can't hear people, but you can also, if
[17:39.660 --> 17:44.340]  you're listening to music really loud, you can just pretend that you know what everybody's
[17:44.340 --> 17:44.900]  talking about.
[17:45.060 --> 17:51.780]  For instance, yesterday at the Home Depot, virtually everybody I saw was having a conversation
[17:51.780 --> 17:54.260]  about how great Jason Tatum and the Boston Celtics are.
[17:54.460 --> 17:58.900]  Whether they were a guy was like pointing at a bandsaw to a Home Depot employee.
[17:58.980 --> 18:00.640]  And they were like, yeah, I know Derek White's amazing, right?
[18:00.660 --> 18:01.380]  They call him the Buffalo.
[18:01.540 --> 18:01.980]  He's crazy.
[18:01.980 --> 18:04.040]  Or a guy over there, like trying to figure out.
[18:04.360 --> 18:05.460]  He's like, do I want this?
[18:05.560 --> 18:06.240]  Do I want this?
[18:06.480 --> 18:07.660]  Do I want a Phillips head?
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.400]  Or maybe I want to go for an Allen wrench.
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.000]  And the other guy's like, yeah, I don't know, man, but Joe Mazzola is killing it with the
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  after timeout plays that they're running.
[18:15.060 --> 18:15.740]  It's just phenomenal.
[18:16.240 --> 18:22.820]  So that's my suggestion is maybe being a headphones in at all times in public kind of guy or a
[18:22.820 --> 18:23.060]  person.
[18:23.080 --> 18:27.900]  And then you control the world around you to a degree that I didn't realize I could.
[18:28.460 --> 18:30.300]  My life hack comes on the heels of that.
[18:30.820 --> 18:36.620]  I am exhausted by the news and I don't want to spend the next four years being rage baited
[18:37.500 --> 18:40.600]  so that corporations can make a lot of money off of my eyeballs.
[18:41.000 --> 18:41.080]  Right.
[18:41.520 --> 18:43.740]  But I also don't want to be a fucking idiot.
[18:43.880 --> 18:44.020]  Right.
[18:44.040 --> 18:44.980]  So I need to strike.
[18:45.300 --> 18:48.440]  I need to straddle the line between like.
[18:50.160 --> 18:56.240]  Ignorant and not so informed that I'm miserable all the time.
[18:56.320 --> 18:56.520]  Right.
[18:57.360 --> 18:58.600]  Here's how I'm going to do that.
[18:58.600 --> 19:04.040]  I figured out how to get my daily dose or my dose of important news.
[19:04.080 --> 19:05.780]  I'm turning off the radio.
[19:05.960 --> 19:06.940]  I'm turning off the TV.
[19:07.040 --> 19:10.920]  I'm never going to listen to or watch news programs or talk radio or any of that stuff
[19:10.920 --> 19:11.200]  again.
[19:12.080 --> 19:15.140]  I'm going to get all my news from sportscasters.
[19:15.540 --> 19:20.680]  If anything crazy or really important happens, they'll break in on a game and tell you, dude.
[19:20.860 --> 19:24.760]  Mike Breen will be like fucking James Harden takes it up to the court.
[19:24.760 --> 19:27.700]  He's got he's got the seven assists already in the first quarter.
[19:27.820 --> 19:31.120]  And oh, it appears that Russia has invaded Ukraine.
[19:31.700 --> 19:33.540]  Harden passes over to Kawhi Leonard.
[19:33.640 --> 19:34.100]  You know what I mean?
[19:34.160 --> 19:34.700]  Like it's.
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.680]  So so without opinion or without any sensationalism, just a delivery of the words.
[19:39.780 --> 19:39.940]  Yeah.
[19:39.960 --> 19:42.400]  You just get the image watching the fucking Lions game.
[19:42.460 --> 19:44.740]  And Chris Collinsworth is like, oh, it's third and ten.
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.100]  And Betty White has died.
[19:46.360 --> 19:48.140]  You know, and you're like, oh, OK, good enough.
[19:49.440 --> 19:50.400]  That's my life hack.
[19:50.500 --> 19:53.600]  Get your news from sportscasters because they got other agendas.
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.000]  So they can they had it.
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.500]  They got to spit it out real fast because it has to be addressed.
[19:57.780 --> 19:59.320]  And then they just go back to the game.
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.460]  So you want your news blend.
[20:01.200 --> 20:06.240]  I just want my news to be brief and to the point and then back to whether James Harden
[20:06.240 --> 20:07.560]  is going to get a triple double or not.
[20:07.900 --> 20:12.000]  And what you're saying, it reminds me of that baseball apology where there's a home run in
[20:12.000 --> 20:12.560]  the middle of it.
[20:12.620 --> 20:13.520]  And he's like giving a heartfelt.
[20:13.640 --> 20:15.860]  He said, I don't remember what he said.
[20:15.920 --> 20:17.380]  He said something horrible, I think.
[20:17.680 --> 20:17.900]  Yeah.
[20:17.940 --> 20:20.200]  And he was apologizing for being insensitive, I think.
[20:20.540 --> 20:21.700]  Yeah, he's apologizing.
[20:21.700 --> 20:23.680]  He's like, listen, it's not what we represent.
[20:23.940 --> 20:26.400]  And Otani hits the ball and it's going deep left.
[20:26.480 --> 20:27.320]  It's going to be a home run.
[20:27.660 --> 20:29.260]  We do not stand by that.
[20:29.320 --> 20:31.340]  He's got to do his job all the way out the door.
[20:31.880 --> 20:34.620]  He's like, that's a that's a 414 foot monster.
[20:34.740 --> 20:40.120]  Anyway, as I said, the job as a broadcaster is to be sensitive to it.
[20:40.940 --> 20:45.700]  I think it's really funny to listen, to assume that what you're listening to isn't something
[20:45.700 --> 20:49.200]  that you've put on, but that the world around you is creating it.
[20:49.260 --> 20:50.240]  I like that a lot, Geoff.
[20:50.240 --> 20:51.860]  Yeah, so that's my two cents.
[20:51.980 --> 20:57.140]  I'm going to I'm going to re-fame my reality for the next couple of years, and I'm going
[20:57.140 --> 21:02.720]  to do that by listening to music in public and pretending I know what the conversations
[21:02.720 --> 21:04.360]  people are having are.
[21:04.540 --> 21:08.740]  And then I'm just going to get all my news from the NBA announcers.
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.500]  So how often do they do a news interruption like that?
[21:12.680 --> 21:19.120]  If there's something important and there are there's there's ten games a night, you know,
[21:19.120 --> 21:20.620]  like I'm not I'm no shortage.
[21:20.740 --> 21:23.920]  If I want if I want any important news, I could just I'd be like, oh, the Grizzlies are
[21:23.920 --> 21:24.880]  playing the Timberwolves tonight.
[21:24.940 --> 21:27.860]  Let me tune in and see if anything happened in Palestine and Israel.
[21:27.940 --> 21:35.680]  The thing that Andrew's talking about, the drive deep to left field by Castellanos, actually
[21:35.680 --> 21:42.500]  has a Wikipedia article about it because it's happened so many times where if you scroll
[21:42.500 --> 21:51.940]  down to further incidents, there are almost ten where important things are being talked
[21:51.940 --> 21:52.300]  about.
[21:52.680 --> 21:58.940]  And Nick Castellanos crushes a ball to left field in the middle of it.
[21:59.380 --> 22:04.620]  It is two and a half hours after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek Democratic
[22:04.620 --> 22:06.760]  nomination in the 2024 presidential election.
[22:06.820 --> 22:10.140]  And the day the news broke, Brenneman would return to national broadcast.
[22:10.140 --> 22:14.820]  Castellanos hit a home run deep to left field with the Phillies to score the final run of
[22:14.820 --> 22:15.940]  a 6-0 win in the Pirates game.
[22:16.180 --> 22:22.780]  Everything about these weird references and like important historical facts have to do
[22:22.780 --> 22:25.060]  with Nick Castellanos hitting a drive to deep left.
[22:25.260 --> 22:25.980]  It's very exciting.
[22:26.620 --> 22:27.400]  That's awesome.
[22:27.960 --> 22:32.480]  I think about the people that learn that Saddam was killed by John Cena.
[22:32.980 --> 22:34.980]  Like that was the source of that information.
[22:36.180 --> 22:38.500]  Oh, yeah, that's he is caught.
[22:38.500 --> 22:41.160]  They've caught and compromised to a permanent end.
[22:43.340 --> 22:47.520]  Phillies and the Orioles are playing and they're like, just want to break in real fast to let
[22:47.520 --> 22:49.440]  everyone know we have killed Osama bin Laden.
[22:50.300 --> 22:51.860]  Anyway, Bryce Harper is up to the plate.
[22:52.000 --> 22:52.500]  You know, it's.
[22:55.500 --> 22:56.240]  I like it.
[22:56.640 --> 22:57.920]  I think it's how I have to live now.
[22:59.780 --> 23:04.640]  You know, in comedy, there's some iconic comedic duos, whether it be King and Peele,
[23:04.640 --> 23:09.680]  Abbott and Costello, Faye and Poehler, just, you know, set up and punch a line working
[23:09.680 --> 23:11.200]  together to come up with the best thing.
[23:11.540 --> 23:14.120]  But you know what the perfect duo is when it comes to growing your business?
[23:14.680 --> 23:16.380]  That's you and Shopify.
[23:17.180 --> 23:21.440]  Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business.
[23:21.820 --> 23:24.980]  So no matter what your goals are, wherever you're at, they're there for you.
[23:25.240 --> 23:29.800]  From the launch your online shop stage to the first real life store stage, all the way
[23:29.800 --> 23:32.540]  to the did we just hit a million order stage.
[23:32.920 --> 23:36.220]  Shopify is there to help you grow, which is great.
[23:36.360 --> 23:40.280]  You know, maybe merch or your store isn't necessarily the focal point of your business.
[23:40.480 --> 23:45.720]  Just having all of the tools and resources that Shopify provides makes it such an easier
[23:45.720 --> 23:46.360]  process.
[23:46.520 --> 23:52.520]  Whether you're selling grown tubes or gerblers, Shopify helps you sell everywhere from their
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.760]  all in one e-commerce platform to their in-person POS system, wherever and whatever you're
[23:57.760 --> 24:00.520]  selling, Shopify has you covered.
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.160]  Which, as I said, is so great.
[24:02.300 --> 24:08.100]  Just having the ability to trust in Shopify, knowing they got you covered, is huge.
[24:08.700 --> 24:12.340]  Shopify helps you turn browsers into buyers with the internet's best converting checkout
[24:12.340 --> 24:17.020]  up to 36% better compared to other leading commerce platforms.
[24:17.460 --> 24:18.160]  36%!
[24:18.480 --> 24:19.320]  That's huge!
[24:19.800 --> 24:20.440]  Substantial!
[24:20.920 --> 24:25.760]  And sell more with less effort thanks to Shopify magic, your AI powered all star.
[24:25.760 --> 24:27.980]  Who doesn't want an all star on a team?
[24:28.280 --> 24:29.100]  Love an all star.
[24:29.580 --> 24:34.820]  Shopify powers 10% of all e-commerce in the US, and Shopify is the global force behind
[24:34.820 --> 24:41.080]  Allbirds, Rothies, and Brooklinen, and millions of other entrepreneurs of every size across
[24:41.920 --> 24:42.960]  175 countries.
[24:43.340 --> 24:44.080]  That's so many!
[24:44.680 --> 24:50.340]  Plus, Shopify's extensive help resources are there to help support your success every step
[24:50.340 --> 24:50.800]  of the way.
[24:51.100 --> 24:54.780]  Which is so important, as I said, and I've said it multiple times, is knowing you're
[24:54.780 --> 24:55.100]  covered.
[24:55.380 --> 24:58.500]  Because businesses that grow, grow with Shopify.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.700]  What I love about Shopify is how no matter how big you want to grow, they give you everything
[25:03.700 --> 25:04.100]  you need.
[25:04.180 --> 25:07.900]  Like maybe you're happy with where you're at, but they can just provide services day
[25:07.900 --> 25:09.920]  to day that make it so much better.
[25:10.100 --> 25:15.180]  If you want to try to grow your business, try to extend to a different level of it,
[25:15.640 --> 25:16.860]  you got something going there.
[25:16.920 --> 25:18.920]  It's just, it's a fantastic service.
[25:18.920 --> 25:26.460]  So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify.com slash face, face, all lowercase.
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.780]  Go to Shopify.com slash face now to grow your business no matter what stage you're in.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.380]  Once again, that is Shopify.com slash face.
[25:37.580 --> 25:41.540]  My favorite part about going to Home Depots, I just walk around and whenever I see anyone
[25:41.540 --> 25:43.840]  working there, I just think, oh, they could be the equalizer.
[25:44.260 --> 25:46.280]  That person, that could be the equalizer right there.
[25:47.080 --> 25:48.120]  That's a really good point.
[25:48.120 --> 25:51.280]  You think, you think an equalizer exists?
[25:51.700 --> 25:54.880]  Like, I like to live in a world in which one does.
[25:55.020 --> 25:59.400]  And if they do exist, they're working at Home Depot as established in the first movie.
[25:59.660 --> 26:01.800]  So whenever I'm in Home Depot, I just walk around going,
[26:01.920 --> 26:03.500]  oh, that could be the equalizer right there.
[26:03.600 --> 26:08.800]  And any employee could be an equalizer and any customer could be a serial killer getting supplies.
[26:09.680 --> 26:10.640]  Also, that's true.
[26:11.020 --> 26:15.620]  If you're listening to music or a podcast on your headphones in a place like Home Depot,
[26:15.980 --> 26:17.220]  you're not in a hurry to leave.
[26:17.620 --> 26:20.680]  Like, hanging out in Home Depot is cool if you bring the music.
[26:20.900 --> 26:21.480]  You know what I mean?
[26:21.580 --> 26:23.320]  It's like suddenly everywhere.
[26:23.660 --> 26:26.680]  I'm in a little less of a hurry to get out of places because I'm like,
[26:26.740 --> 26:29.680]  yeah, I got the fucking best jukebox in the world right here with me.
[26:29.920 --> 26:32.060]  Yeah, I feel like I've been doing this since Bluetooth was invented.
[26:32.680 --> 26:33.060]  Have you?
[26:33.100 --> 26:34.760]  I don't see you walk around with headphones in.
[26:35.260 --> 26:36.160]  Do you see me walk around?
[26:36.720 --> 26:37.420]  All the time.
[26:39.600 --> 26:40.680]  I've got cameras on me.
[26:41.040 --> 26:43.740]  I only see you when you walk outside to shave.
[26:44.660 --> 26:45.540]  Broken mirror.
[26:47.420 --> 26:50.480]  I also really hate loud noise.
[26:50.780 --> 26:53.140]  Like if I'm vacuuming, I have to have headphones on.
[26:53.840 --> 26:57.420]  I just think I'm never stepping foot in public without headphones in again.
[26:58.300 --> 27:01.560]  And it's also a great excuse not to ever have to talk to anybody ever again.
[27:02.060 --> 27:04.000]  Yeah, that is a great excuse.
[27:04.680 --> 27:08.840]  I usually have the transparency on there so I can hear if I'm about to run over.
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.500]  That's a good idea.
[27:11.120 --> 27:12.980]  You typically would want to know that information.
[27:12.980 --> 27:14.740]  I don't offer noise cancel.
[27:15.080 --> 27:17.280]  I think if I was about to be run over, I wouldn't want to know.
[27:17.660 --> 27:18.680]  You don't think you could avoid it?
[27:20.380 --> 27:24.240]  If you just heard a bunch of tires squeaking and could jump out of the way, you wouldn't want to know.
[27:24.380 --> 27:26.240]  If I could avoid it, yes.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.180]  But if not, I'd rather just be surprised.
[27:28.720 --> 27:32.480]  I'd rather just be like alive and happy and then suddenly I'm in heaven.
[27:33.400 --> 27:34.480]  You might not die.
[27:35.440 --> 27:36.540]  You might just get tossed.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.320]  It's pretty bold that you would assume that you would just immediately be going to heaven.
[27:40.820 --> 27:41.780]  And immediately.
[27:41.780 --> 27:42.940]  I'm on the short list.
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.220]  You think St. Peter's like a big A.H. fan or what?
[27:49.920 --> 27:51.980]  Maybe not an A.H. fan, but he liked Red vs. Blue.
[27:53.140 --> 27:53.520]  That's fair.
[27:54.220 --> 27:55.340]  That's pretty good, man.
[27:55.360 --> 27:56.160]  That's some strong seasons.
[27:56.680 --> 27:58.300]  Yeah, I got a few of those in my pocket.
[27:58.420 --> 27:58.600]  I'm good.
[28:01.140 --> 28:02.120]  How about Haunter?
[28:02.340 --> 28:03.220]  You like those stuff, right?
[28:03.420 --> 28:03.840]  I gotcha.
[28:04.040 --> 28:04.600]  You like game shows?
[28:05.160 --> 28:06.320]  How do you feel about Monopoly?
[28:06.400 --> 28:07.400]  I did a hardcore Monopoly.
[28:07.460 --> 28:08.280]  Are you good with that?
[28:08.480 --> 28:08.660]  Fine.
[28:09.920 --> 28:11.680]  Was there a gun in your hardcore Monopoly?
[28:11.780 --> 28:14.300]  Your hardcore Monopoly wasn't as hardcore as mine.
[28:15.740 --> 28:19.460]  All mine had was a cage under the table that we'd lock people in.
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.020]  What was your guys' childhood landline etiquette?
[28:26.720 --> 28:27.980]  I don't even know what you... what?
[28:28.280 --> 28:30.000]  Like, you know when people had phones?
[28:30.700 --> 28:30.900]  Yeah.
[28:31.340 --> 28:31.940]  A house phone.
[28:32.420 --> 28:32.740]  Yeah.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.440]  I never understood that as a kid, if the phone rang, we had to answer it no matter what.
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.220]  If we were all having dinner and the phone rang, I would be told by my parents to go and answer it
[28:44.220 --> 28:47.520]  and tell them that we're eating and we can't... then we'll call them back.
[28:47.900 --> 28:50.480]  But it's like, isn't that the whole purpose of not answering?
[28:50.800 --> 28:53.760]  I was always so confused that I was stopping what I was doing
[28:53.760 --> 28:56.600]  to tell them I'm not available to then go back to what I was doing.
[28:56.880 --> 28:58.340]  So you wouldn't be inconvenienced.
[28:58.760 --> 29:02.720]  Right, but you also don't know what it... like, it could be an emergency.
[29:03.300 --> 29:04.520]  There could be something going on.
[29:04.580 --> 29:08.860]  Yeah, most of the time it's not, but it would be crazy, I think,
[29:08.860 --> 29:11.460]  to just go, no, we're not answering the phone.
[29:12.360 --> 29:14.520]  Also, you have to keep hearing it ring.
[29:14.820 --> 29:16.880]  Well, there was a button to stop it ringing.
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.960]  At the point, though, where you walk up to hit the button.
[29:20.620 --> 29:23.540]  You would get up to hit the button to stop it ringing,
[29:23.660 --> 29:26.720]  but you wouldn't answer and say, we'll call you back in a little bit.
[29:27.120 --> 29:29.260]  I mean, that's how I wanted to do it. I wasn't allowed to do that.
[29:29.940 --> 29:33.820]  You would run across the entire house to get to the phone if it was ringing.
[29:34.300 --> 29:36.000]  You'd be outside cutting the grass.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.100]  If you'd heard the door, you'd run a full sprint to get there and you'd go,
[29:41.380 --> 29:43.760]  hello? And you're like, no, he's not here.
[29:44.040 --> 29:45.400]  And it was never anything.
[29:46.180 --> 29:48.400]  But yeah, you're right, Gav, it was very important.
[29:48.880 --> 29:50.600]  Yeah, it just had to be done.
[29:50.680 --> 29:54.100]  But now I feel like I ignore the phone 99% of the time.
[29:54.240 --> 29:55.100]  Yeah, nobody answers the phone.
[29:55.320 --> 29:59.620]  It's only an emergency if someone rings twice, in my opinion.
[30:00.200 --> 30:03.740]  No one's going to have an emergency and just ring once to be like, oh, they weren't in.
[30:03.740 --> 30:07.900]  We went from a must must answer to never answer world.
[30:08.120 --> 30:10.600]  And that's a hard flip. 180 degrees.
[30:11.020 --> 30:12.360]  We flipped as a society.
[30:12.480 --> 30:14.240]  I've started even doing it with the front door.
[30:14.580 --> 30:15.800]  I treat that like a phone.
[30:16.460 --> 30:18.400]  Never answer the front door. Are you kidding?
[30:20.720 --> 30:21.600]  What's it for?
[30:23.200 --> 30:26.160]  I just don't think knocking on someone's door should be the norm.
[30:26.900 --> 30:28.160]  How would you like it done?
[30:29.660 --> 30:31.560]  Uh, make an appointment somehow.
[30:32.380 --> 30:33.900]  Over the phone that I won't answer.
[30:35.900 --> 30:39.280]  Hey, if you want to come to my house and knock on my door, call me first.
[30:39.460 --> 30:42.300]  Also, I'm not answering that shit, so you figure it out.
[30:43.320 --> 30:43.860]  When is it?
[30:43.920 --> 30:48.520]  When do you ever want to answer the door when somebody knocks on the door or the doorbell
[30:48.520 --> 30:51.020]  rings and you look out the window and you don't recognize the person?
[30:51.120 --> 30:52.680]  When is it ever worth opening that door?
[30:53.000 --> 30:53.160]  Never.
[30:53.320 --> 30:53.600]  Yeah, it's not.
[30:53.700 --> 30:56.020]  When are you ever like, God, I'm glad I opened that door.
[30:56.440 --> 30:57.680]  Here's what happens when someone knocks on the door.
[30:57.680 --> 30:59.160]  They stand there for a bit.
[30:59.900 --> 31:01.100]  Obviously, I'm not answering the door.
[31:01.280 --> 31:05.500]  And then they slip a little, like, tree-trimming business card in the door and then they leave.
[31:06.120 --> 31:06.700]  That's what happens.
[31:07.500 --> 31:07.740]  It's true.
[31:08.220 --> 31:13.460]  Or some guy's got a little iPad, like, glued to his hand via some strap and he's like,
[31:15.200 --> 31:16.960]  we're insulting Google in your neighborhood.
[31:17.260 --> 31:18.360]  And you're like, it's OK, I'm happy.
[31:18.660 --> 31:20.360]  And he's like, well, I think you'd be happier with Google.
[31:20.500 --> 31:23.920]  And you're like, I don't think you know me well enough to know what makes me tick.
[31:24.220 --> 31:26.100]  I'm pretty sure I'm happy with what I have.
[31:26.100 --> 31:27.980]  And they're like, I think we can make you a little bit happier.
[31:28.080 --> 31:31.420]  And you're like, the only way you can make me happier is if you turned around and left right
[31:31.420 --> 31:34.620]  now and they're like, I'm still going to pester you a little bit first.
[31:34.920 --> 31:36.780]  Dude, Geoff, I got a life hack for you.
[31:37.160 --> 31:37.980]  I've been using this.
[31:38.040 --> 31:39.040]  I didn't even think about it.
[31:39.300 --> 31:42.680]  When somebody comes to your door to sell you something, they, oh, yeah, we're,
[31:42.760 --> 31:44.700]  oh, we're doing pest control in the area.
[31:44.800 --> 31:45.600]  Do you want to do this thing?
[31:45.720 --> 31:49.720]  I just, no matter what it is, I just go, oh, we're actually in the process of selling right now.
[31:50.340 --> 31:52.560]  Oh, and they go, oh, OK.
[31:52.800 --> 31:53.720]  And then they leave.
[31:54.160 --> 31:56.820]  That's, I've never had a conversation go past that.
[31:57.240 --> 32:01.280]  What I've been doing this lately that's been working fairly well that drives my wife crazy
[32:01.280 --> 32:04.200]  is if anybody calls or, because sometimes I have to pick it up because I don't know
[32:04.200 --> 32:05.500]  if it'd be like a Millie related thing.
[32:06.060 --> 32:09.220]  And I'll be like, oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
[32:09.260 --> 32:10.260]  I lost my job this year.
[32:10.420 --> 32:11.280]  I don't have a job anymore.
[32:11.380 --> 32:11.920]  I don't have extra.
[32:12.380 --> 32:16.500]  Oh, and they're like, oh, well, I mean, that's a real true thing.
[32:16.800 --> 32:17.160]  Damn.
[32:17.360 --> 32:17.580]  Yeah.
[32:17.640 --> 32:18.680]  And then I'm not lying.
[32:18.780 --> 32:19.640]  I'm like, yeah, I'm sorry.
[32:19.760 --> 32:20.920]  I got, I got laid off.
[32:21.200 --> 32:22.700]  And then they're like, oh, sorry, man.
[32:22.700 --> 32:23.560]  I hope things turn around.
[32:23.640 --> 32:24.360]  And I'm like, yeah, me too.
[32:24.460 --> 32:28.280]  Anyway, best of luck selling that vacation package.
[32:28.980 --> 32:29.740]  That's pretty good.
[32:30.420 --> 32:32.200]  Yeah, that's pretty good one to just hold on to.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.000]  You don't even have to lie.
[32:33.560 --> 32:35.920]  Andrew, you strike me as someone who might still have a landline.
[32:36.540 --> 32:37.740]  You know, it's funny you say that.
[32:37.840 --> 32:43.900]  I only lost the landline because the place that I moved into doesn't have a line in it.
[32:44.220 --> 32:46.400]  Do you prefer having a landline?
[32:46.620 --> 32:47.740]  I had a landline.
[32:48.520 --> 32:50.180]  How often would you say you used it?
[32:50.940 --> 32:51.180]  Never.
[32:52.700 --> 32:53.060]  Did it ring?
[32:54.160 --> 32:54.640]  Yeah.
[32:54.940 --> 32:55.040]  Yeah.
[32:55.180 --> 32:56.060]  If someone called.
[32:56.200 --> 32:56.360]  Yeah.
[32:56.860 --> 32:58.380]  Well, no, I understand the concept.
[32:59.140 --> 33:03.500]  How many people, how many people in your life, Andrew?
[33:03.720 --> 33:07.880]  How many people in your world knew your landline number and would call you?
[33:08.840 --> 33:11.140]  Not many, because I had a cell phone as well.
[33:11.220 --> 33:13.400]  So if it rang, it was a wrong number.
[33:13.560 --> 33:18.620]  Yeah, it was either a wrong number or like it was a I had ordered something
[33:18.620 --> 33:21.200]  and that was the number I used for the delivery.
[33:21.700 --> 33:23.860]  When was the last time outside of Andrew?
[33:24.100 --> 33:25.300]  It was apparently very recently.
[33:25.420 --> 33:27.980]  When was the last time the rest of you had a landline?
[33:28.140 --> 33:30.720]  Like, do you remember when you got rid of your landline?
[33:31.200 --> 33:33.460]  I mean, I had one up until I moved from England.
[33:33.940 --> 33:34.380]  Yeah.
[33:34.880 --> 33:36.120]  So when you moved to America.
[33:36.480 --> 33:36.680]  Yeah.
[33:37.260 --> 33:41.880]  It was a point of outrage when I first moved into the place I'm currently in that I didn't
[33:41.880 --> 33:46.120]  have a landline because I thought I had a bunch, but it turns out they were just all
[33:46.120 --> 33:48.800]  Ethernet outlets in places.
[33:49.240 --> 33:50.600]  There's some that surely more helpful.
[33:51.360 --> 33:53.500]  Well, no, I mean, not when you want a landline.
[33:53.840 --> 33:57.780]  Well, you can have like a PoE VoIP phone if you want.
[33:59.200 --> 33:59.580]  A what?
[34:00.240 --> 34:02.380]  Like an internet phone powered by Ethernet.
[34:03.400 --> 34:05.060]  PoE is Prison of Elders to me.
[34:05.120 --> 34:06.280]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[34:06.440 --> 34:08.580]  Yeah, don't you have a you want a Prison of Elders phone?
[34:09.740 --> 34:10.680]  Power over Ethernet.
[34:11.840 --> 34:12.900]  Power of Ethernet?
[34:13.060 --> 34:13.880]  Voice over IP.
[34:14.160 --> 34:15.080]  Power over Ether.
[34:15.440 --> 34:16.200]  Jesus Christ.
[34:18.640 --> 34:20.220]  The Ethernet needs to be powered?
[34:20.220 --> 34:25.200]  You can Prison of Elders things through Ethernet.
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.040]  I don't know what that means.
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.000]  I just know the context of Prison of Elders.
[34:30.340 --> 34:31.720]  We did the Prison of Elders.
[34:31.920 --> 34:34.360]  You do it like once a week and you could get some gear.
[34:34.720 --> 34:35.160]  It was hard.
[34:35.600 --> 34:36.240]  It was really difficult.
[34:37.060 --> 34:37.980]  You know what else is difficult?
[34:38.800 --> 34:39.360]  What's difficult?
[34:39.980 --> 34:43.120]  Gears of War 5 on inconceivable difficulty.
[34:43.520 --> 34:44.040]  It's thrilling.
[34:44.180 --> 34:44.340]  Yeah.
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.200]  So Andrew had the funniest idea.
[34:47.660 --> 34:48.540]  What was my idea?
[34:48.540 --> 34:51.860]  Well, parts 1, 2, and 3 came out.
[34:51.960 --> 34:52.400]  Yes.
[34:52.740 --> 34:55.500]  And we recorded them, you know, a few months apart each, probably.
[34:56.300 --> 35:03.200]  And now Andrew has suggested we do we record every other part between episodes 3 and 4 coming out.
[35:03.880 --> 35:05.680]  I just think that that's going to happen.
[35:06.080 --> 35:12.940]  So we're we just recorded episodes 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 this week, I believe.
[35:13.140 --> 35:14.400]  6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[35:14.460 --> 35:14.620]  Yeah.
[35:14.760 --> 35:15.620]  5 episodes this week.
[35:15.620 --> 35:18.340]  It was a thing where before we started, Geoff was like, you guys don't know this,
[35:18.340 --> 35:21.740]  but we've been recording like two a day every day this week.
[35:21.760 --> 35:25.040]  And I just went like, yeah, man, I see you guys in this server.
[35:25.220 --> 35:27.260]  And I'm just going, no fucking way.
[35:27.320 --> 35:29.040]  They're still playing this fucking game.
[35:29.540 --> 35:32.640]  I unbelievable how much time you put into it this week.
[35:32.680 --> 35:33.300]  That's crazy.
[35:33.300 --> 35:39.680]  We're playing it on the hardest difficulty and doing every side mission and collectible now.
[35:39.860 --> 35:41.520]  But we only started that halfway through.
[35:41.600 --> 35:43.380]  So we're not going to get anything for it at the end.
[35:44.400 --> 35:49.000]  Every hard thing we've done, we've started just after we could have got the achievement.
[35:49.740 --> 35:50.020]  Yeah.
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.380]  It's pretty futile.
[35:52.720 --> 35:56.220]  But it's been so fun. I've been looking forward to every day.
[35:56.740 --> 36:01.020]  And there's definitely a new dynamic between me and Andrew now.
[36:01.100 --> 36:01.560]  Andrew!
[36:02.060 --> 36:06.140]  So the way this works, guys, is if you haven't watched the first three videos,
[36:06.760 --> 36:10.180]  and if you haven't and you want to, they're up on the Patreon, I believe.
[36:10.320 --> 36:10.820]  They're on the Patreon.
[36:11.020 --> 36:13.060]  And I just made a collections tab.
[36:13.060 --> 36:16.240]  If you click collections, there is a Gears of War collection.
[36:16.380 --> 36:17.820]  That is all the videos that are uploaded.
[36:18.220 --> 36:21.180]  Are they for book standard apart from the busted slideshow one?
[36:21.800 --> 36:23.980]  I think that's a great question.
[36:24.600 --> 36:29.760]  I believe they're available to anyone who has a Patreon account and is part of the page.
[36:30.120 --> 36:31.740]  OK, so free or paid.
[36:31.800 --> 36:32.340]  OK, great.
[36:32.720 --> 36:33.480]  That would be awesome.
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.780]  But it might be.
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.600]  I don't.
[36:35.660 --> 36:37.560]  I can double check that really quick.
[36:38.700 --> 36:42.220]  The way Gears used to work, though, is it was four player co-op.
[36:42.220 --> 36:44.920]  This one is three player co-op, but not really.
[36:45.120 --> 36:47.920]  It's really two players get to be cogs.
[36:48.180 --> 36:51.840]  And then one player has to be the bullshit robot named Jack,
[36:51.900 --> 36:55.580]  who just opens doors and occasionally shields people.
[36:55.800 --> 37:00.960]  Even though a lot of the game is four characters running around, just two of them are like...
[37:01.740 --> 37:07.000]  We're on an open world level right now on a skiff with four human characters and a robot.
[37:07.240 --> 37:11.660]  And two of the human characters are just fucking AI for some reason.
[37:11.660 --> 37:13.900]  I would have been so excited to play one of them.
[37:14.000 --> 37:17.420]  Although Geoff has unlocked an ability to possess enemies.
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.120]  So briefly, in every fight, you get like 90 seconds of gameplay.
[37:22.480 --> 37:23.060]  It's true.
[37:23.260 --> 37:25.360]  I've found ways to make it fun for sure.
[37:25.420 --> 37:27.260]  I can zap and do a few things.
[37:27.820 --> 37:33.920]  But the real fun for the game for me is that I can't really help in any difficult way.
[37:33.920 --> 37:34.180]  Right.
[37:34.220 --> 37:40.460]  Other than like, oh, we need the robot to open this door or to zap this thing to turn the power off.
[37:40.460 --> 37:44.380]  When it comes to killing and fighting, it's got to be all Gavin and Andrew.
[37:44.520 --> 37:50.180]  And they are gonna kill each other in real life before we get to the end of this series.
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.880]  It is so entertaining to watch them go at it.
[37:52.940 --> 37:54.640]  And they are losing their minds.
[37:55.120 --> 37:59.240]  Gavin has... he's been in full weasel mode.
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.100]  Well, here's the thing.
[38:00.420 --> 38:01.600]  Andrew called me a rabbit.
[38:01.720 --> 38:03.580]  I got demoted from weasel to rabbit.
[38:04.040 --> 38:04.900]  No, promoted, I'd say.
[38:05.260 --> 38:05.700]  Oh, promoted.
[38:05.700 --> 38:14.020]  But what happens is that I'm like 40% rabbit mode and 60% incompetent and just not good at the game.
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.740]  But both of those add up to 100% annoyance for Andrew.
[38:19.220 --> 38:19.920]  No, it's not.
[38:20.020 --> 38:21.940]  I don't mind you being bad at the game.
[38:22.100 --> 38:23.220]  That's totally fine.
[38:23.420 --> 38:24.360]  That's not an issue.
[38:25.280 --> 38:30.760]  It's... you will... you have... you know how to needle me in just the perfect way of like,
[38:30.800 --> 38:31.500]  we know each other.
[38:31.500 --> 38:34.520]  But it's not... it's not needling in a way of like,
[38:34.560 --> 38:37.280]  I'm actually like upset and that will carry over.
[38:37.420 --> 38:39.400]  It's just in the moment of like, you piece of shit.
[38:39.580 --> 38:41.560]  Like, fuck you, son of a bitch.
[38:41.920 --> 38:44.700]  He's really precise about how he wields it too.
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.040]  Like, he'll be fine until like the 23rd attempt at a boss fight.
[38:50.680 --> 38:51.660]  You know what I mean?
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.660]  But when morale is really low and it really... you're really susceptible to it.
[38:57.940 --> 38:59.820]  Well, I feel like it spices the team back up.
[38:59.820 --> 39:04.040]  Because sometimes we start off and it's like, yeah, let's do it.
[39:04.080 --> 39:10.200]  And then on the 37th attempt at a boss fight, it's just complete silence from beginning to end.
[39:10.640 --> 39:14.640]  Poor Nick doesn't know it, but he's turned into a verb whenever anybody's spiraling and
[39:14.640 --> 39:16.720]  just like fucking losing their ability to play.
[39:16.820 --> 39:17.160]  They're naked.
[39:18.180 --> 39:22.140]  So just to clarify for the Gears of War thing, it is bogged standard and up.
[39:22.180 --> 39:25.840]  So any level of membership, you can watch those videos that are currently up.
[39:26.900 --> 39:28.180]  It has been a process.
[39:28.180 --> 39:29.280]  Yeah, it is.
[39:29.440 --> 39:33.840]  I would say there is only one time where I like really unloaded on Gavin.
[39:34.080 --> 39:37.140]  But even then, it wasn't like I was truly mad.
[39:37.200 --> 39:39.440]  It was just he's a son of a bitch.
[39:39.860 --> 39:43.320]  Well, and that was also I was just using the words you used against me yesterday.
[39:44.340 --> 39:47.120]  Just back against you, and it was at the wrong time.
[39:48.920 --> 39:51.780]  There's a fucking mechanic in the game where you could...
[39:51.780 --> 39:56.940]  Half of the game, you're in the snow on an ice planet, like an Empire Strikes Back.
[39:58.640 --> 40:02.480]  And you fight enemies, you learn that you can shoot the ground out from under them,
[40:02.540 --> 40:05.520]  the ice out from under them, and then they'll drown in the water.
[40:05.920 --> 40:13.480]  We got to a particularly difficult point where I want to say we probably spent 25 to 35 minutes
[40:13.480 --> 40:16.700]  trying to beat this one section of the game.
[40:16.840 --> 40:19.760]  And we finally, finally did.
[40:19.940 --> 40:23.900]  And the moment it like, you know, there's like a little cut scene and it returns you
[40:23.900 --> 40:28.060]  the characters. By the way, this game is stingy as dicks with checkpoints.
[40:28.260 --> 40:31.800]  But the second it cuts back in, we start walking across the wide
[40:31.800 --> 40:34.440]  robot across and Andrew and Gavin are walking across.
[40:34.660 --> 40:39.380]  And I look back and then Andrew's just a popsicle floating around in the water, frozen.
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.560]  Gavin just shot the ground out from under him immediately after getting past that point.
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.780]  No checkpoint. We had to do it all over again.
[40:47.800 --> 40:50.400]  Probably another 30 minutes before we beat it again.
[40:50.400 --> 40:54.620]  That might have been the low point of Andrew's experience.
[40:55.040 --> 40:57.480]  And you could look forward to seeing that in May of 2025.
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.640]  That was so shocking. I thought it was a narrative thing.
[41:02.720 --> 41:07.120]  Like I thought I had went into a cut scene of like I was supposed to fall in and then you guys
[41:07.120 --> 41:10.100]  saved me and then we just died and we had to do it all over again.
[41:10.720 --> 41:16.440]  The thing that broke me, the moment where I just I hit a wall is the last one we filmed.
[41:16.440 --> 41:22.320]  We had to do a thing where we're in a desert with nothing but space and
[41:23.740 --> 41:32.660]  these explosive enemies climb out of the sand below you and they have no legs.
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.140]  They don't have any way to shoot you. They have no real weapons.
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.360]  All they can do to hurt you is you kill them and they blow up next to you.
[41:40.500 --> 41:43.700]  And Gavin could not get through this sequence.
[41:43.700 --> 41:51.220]  He kept blowing up time and time again. And it just by the like 11th reset, I was done.
[41:51.340 --> 41:55.560]  You were just screaming. You went silent for like the last three and then suddenly you're like,
[41:55.680 --> 41:59.080]  they don't have legs. They don't even have legs. What are you doing?
[41:59.860 --> 42:04.200]  But I think a lot of this is to blame on the fact that I'm still trying to get this
[42:04.200 --> 42:06.880]  achievement for getting a kill with every relic weapon.
[42:07.040 --> 42:11.920]  And I just picked up the relic version of the closest range weapon in the game.
[42:11.920 --> 42:16.120]  And I was determined to get a kill with it. But we're through. We passed it.
[42:16.980 --> 42:20.620]  I'd say probably like 70% of the way through this game.
[42:21.140 --> 42:25.460]  Eric seems to have posted a picture of a rabbit attacking iJustine or something.
[42:25.900 --> 42:30.340]  I sent this video to Andrew the other day and I just said,
[42:30.560 --> 42:32.820]  this is Gavin when you mess up. And it's just,
[42:33.340 --> 42:40.620]  it's this like Ukrainian jackrabbit that I started following that just beats these people up.
[42:40.620 --> 42:46.040]  It's so big. It's not that pet. Yes, it lives at their house.
[42:46.160 --> 42:49.340]  It is an evil little jackrabbit. It's so strong.
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.520]  And she just sits on the couch and it walks up to her and it just goes
[42:53.980 --> 42:57.340]  just starts fucking hitting her. And I was just like, oh, this is Andrew and Gavin.
[43:00.120 --> 43:04.960]  Anyway, I only brought it up to tell the audience, if you're looking for some classic
[43:05.460 --> 43:10.260]  Gavin and Andrew needling each other, take those videos for a spin.
[43:10.620 --> 43:13.600]  If you're ever bored, I think if and when they ever come out,
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.760]  because I think they're pretty funny. What we are talking about maybe doing,
[43:17.880 --> 43:21.340]  Eric, is we're going to when this eventually all comes out,
[43:21.980 --> 43:27.740]  it'll probably be like, I don't know, 40 plus hours of gameplay over.
[43:27.840 --> 43:30.900]  I don't even know how many parts we're talking like. 31 is the guess.
[43:31.140 --> 43:33.920]  I'm going to guess mid 20s. How funny it would be
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.820]  if we like put all of them together and release that as a singular gameplay.
[43:38.660 --> 43:41.760]  That's that is the we'll run out of. We don't we can't.
[43:42.240 --> 43:46.080]  We don't have enough space on Patreon. We have like maybe we do this.
[43:46.260 --> 43:51.320]  We have a finite amount of like we can't just 31.
[43:51.480 --> 43:54.400]  Like imagine uploading a 31 hour video to Patreon.
[43:54.640 --> 43:57.240]  We already had to go. Hey, can we get more space?
[43:57.480 --> 44:00.660]  Well, 31 parts would probably be like 60 to 70 hours.
[44:00.800 --> 44:04.520]  Yeah. Oh, you know, speaking of a 31 hour
[44:05.080 --> 44:08.760]  video that actually gives reminds me of an idea I wanted to pitch you guys on.
[44:09.580 --> 44:13.800]  What do you think the longest podcast ever recorded is?
[44:14.060 --> 44:16.700]  And do you think it should be us? No.
[44:17.260 --> 44:19.380]  And we could be in the Guinness Book of World Records.
[44:19.800 --> 44:23.800]  No, no, that's not. Would you like one marathon episode?
[44:23.940 --> 44:28.500]  We just go till we break the record. No, the record is like 150 hours or something.
[44:29.200 --> 44:32.860]  153 hour marathon podcast. Who did it? Who did it? Who did it?
[44:32.860 --> 44:36.120]  Some Dutch podcast. Oh, we're better than the Dutch.
[44:36.280 --> 44:39.680]  We can do 154 hours. No, we can't beat the Dutch.
[44:39.860 --> 44:43.040]  All right, man. You started with some so all right stuff for
[44:43.500 --> 44:49.120]  I would say if you can get it to like 145 hours, we can 150 hours.
[44:49.220 --> 44:52.960]  We can swoop in. I could do the first 30 hours by myself,
[44:52.960 --> 44:57.280]  but you guys got to help out at some point. We were getting quiet after like 90 minutes
[44:57.280 --> 45:04.240]  I well, that's different. That is different. You are getting fatigued by the game about your.
[45:04.440 --> 45:07.040]  Yeah, you're focusing and trying to fuck my point.
[45:07.900 --> 45:10.180]  No, for me, it's not running out of shit to talk about.
[45:10.260 --> 45:13.360]  It's that you're getting beaten down by the world that you're in.
[45:13.600 --> 45:15.780]  And you don't have that when we're podcasting.
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.760]  Yeah, you're not getting beat down by you like we are 90 minutes into a let's play.
[45:23.020 --> 45:25.560]  That's yeah. It seems long.
[45:25.620 --> 45:28.180]  I'm just throwing that out there. 154 hours. Break the record.
[45:28.280 --> 45:31.160]  Be in the Guinness Book till somebody breaks ours. I think we could do it.
[45:31.220 --> 45:36.400]  We'd be like the Dave Chappelle of of podcasting, not in terms of content,
[45:36.400 --> 45:39.860]  but just like he, I think, has the record for longest stand up or at least he did for a while.
[45:40.460 --> 45:43.560]  It was him and Dane Cook were like going back and forth for a couple of years.
[45:44.300 --> 45:46.040]  Found out do each other. Gear two heroes.
[45:49.300 --> 45:51.060]  We didn't. So we've been doing a lot of gears,
[45:51.060 --> 45:54.380]  but we also we played some zombies just that wasn't recorded.
[45:55.120 --> 46:00.400]  Eric, Gavin, Geoff, myself, one evening booted up some Call of Duty zombies.
[46:00.740 --> 46:03.080]  Had so much fun. That is such a good mode.
[46:03.400 --> 46:05.660]  I haven't done that in such a long time where it's just like,
[46:05.700 --> 46:08.120]  oh, it's up to like one in the morning playing video games.
[46:08.300 --> 46:10.080]  It was so much fun.
[46:10.340 --> 46:12.720]  It was. It was like Saturday night, maybe a Friday night.
[46:12.780 --> 46:15.000]  We did it like, yeah, till about 130 in the morning.
[46:15.080 --> 46:17.560]  I think it's the first time I had fun playing zombies.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.860]  I think historically I thought that mode was dog shit.
[46:19.860 --> 46:22.880]  And I don't even watch it. Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
[46:23.540 --> 46:25.760]  It was so much fun. Eric, it's such a funny line.
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.260]  It was the night where it shifted.
[46:27.420 --> 46:30.580]  Time changed. And you're like, well, if we just keep playing, we'll get another hour.
[46:31.020 --> 46:32.420]  Yeah, great. It'll be fine.
[46:32.980 --> 46:34.720]  It'll be totally fine. Yeah.
[46:35.260 --> 46:37.400]  Yeah. Because all of a sudden, Gavin's like, this is my last one.
[46:37.440 --> 46:38.940]  It's like, why if we play for one more hour?
[46:39.240 --> 46:42.400]  It's like we didn't play at all. So it's fine to go to bed.
[46:44.000 --> 46:44.980]  It's really cool.
[46:45.040 --> 46:48.580]  And then we've been like recording like you guys just recorded a zombies video.
[46:48.580 --> 46:52.500]  It's like an hour long trying to just get through like wave after wave.
[46:52.680 --> 46:54.420]  It's just such a fun mode.
[46:54.460 --> 46:57.600]  And it's so easy to like get into.
[46:57.780 --> 47:01.100]  It's unbelievable. It's the only game that lets you play it.
[47:01.340 --> 47:01.980]  It's fantastic.
[47:02.420 --> 47:07.060]  I think it's maybe the most dramatic shift from one video to the next,
[47:07.080 --> 47:11.260]  where we recorded a different like general Call of Duty video where we played zombies.
[47:11.420 --> 47:15.580]  And it's us just going, well, how does everything what is happening?
[47:15.780 --> 47:17.460]  Well, how does this work? What are we doing?
[47:17.460 --> 47:19.320]  I'm lost. I don't know what's happening.
[47:19.460 --> 47:23.260]  We're getting destroyed to the video we recorded today of like,
[47:23.340 --> 47:26.020]  OK, we got to get the pack a punch going. We got to get the juice going.
[47:26.320 --> 47:27.760]  Got to make sure we got a wonder weapon.
[47:28.040 --> 47:29.160]  We're like, yeah, we're fucking. Yeah.
[47:29.460 --> 47:30.520]  Yeah, we're so locked in.
[47:30.660 --> 47:32.660]  Maybe we should put those videos out back to back.
[47:33.360 --> 47:37.940]  I have a question about theft.
[47:38.860 --> 47:41.520]  OK, when is stealing stealing?
[47:42.200 --> 47:46.480]  Like, can I as long as I buy everything on the way out of the store,
[47:46.480 --> 47:47.820]  I haven't stolen anything, right?
[47:49.440 --> 47:51.200]  Yeah, I what?
[47:51.580 --> 47:56.180]  Like if like if I if I'm like walking around the store, I didn't get a basket.
[47:56.280 --> 47:57.020]  I didn't bring a bag.
[47:57.560 --> 48:02.380]  Can I just fill my pockets with stuff and then take it all out and buy it on the way out?
[48:02.420 --> 48:05.460]  Or will I get pulled into a room for shoplifting?
[48:06.180 --> 48:09.740]  No, they can't arrest you for shoplifting until you shoplift.
[48:10.200 --> 48:15.180]  So if you were to like to fill your pockets with stuff and then walk up to the cash register
[48:15.180 --> 48:18.260]  and then start pulling shit out of your pockets in front of her, I think you'd be fine.
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.800]  See, the scenario where it gets maybe a little bit sketchy is if let's say you're
[48:24.660 --> 48:27.540]  super dehydrated and you just need something to drink to drink,
[48:27.600 --> 48:30.280]  like grab a bottle and drink in the store.
[48:30.560 --> 48:31.380]  Do you ever do that?
[48:31.500 --> 48:31.920]  The purchase?
[48:32.020 --> 48:32.580]  I do that all the time.
[48:32.760 --> 48:33.540]  I do that all the time.
[48:33.580 --> 48:35.800]  Yeah. Oh, dude, it feels like stealing.
[48:35.860 --> 48:37.820]  It gives me the same thrill as shoplifting.
[48:38.200 --> 48:40.260]  Yeah, it really it's all.
[48:40.380 --> 48:42.020]  Andrew, you got to try it.
[48:42.060 --> 48:42.460]  It is.
[48:42.680 --> 48:43.320]  I don't need that.
[48:43.400 --> 48:44.420]  I find that stressful.
[48:44.780 --> 48:47.480]  No, dude, you feel like a little bad boy, but you're not.
[48:47.740 --> 48:48.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:48.700 --> 48:49.700]  Because you're going to pay for it.
[48:49.760 --> 48:50.860]  You're going to pay for that prime.
[48:51.040 --> 48:51.820]  And I know you're drinking prime.
[48:51.920 --> 48:54.600]  But what if that what if that coincides with the one time you forgot your wallet?
[48:56.060 --> 48:56.520]  Apple Pay.
[48:57.180 --> 48:58.060]  Oh, you forgot.
[48:58.900 --> 48:59.460]  I used it.
[48:59.480 --> 49:00.500]  I used it yesterday.
[49:00.760 --> 49:01.900]  I went to a coffee shop.
[49:02.080 --> 49:03.380]  I was I went for a walk yesterday.
[49:03.460 --> 49:04.260]  Walked to a coffee shop.
[49:04.300 --> 49:05.300]  Realized that I know my wallet on me.
[49:05.340 --> 49:06.400]  It was like, oh, I just ordered.
[49:06.520 --> 49:06.900]  All right.
[49:06.940 --> 49:07.300]  Apple Pay.
[49:07.360 --> 49:07.780]  It's 2024.
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.320]  H-E-B just got Apple Pay on the around the 10th anniversary of Apple Pay.
[49:13.320 --> 49:15.100]  And tapped to pay.
[49:15.380 --> 49:15.560]  God damn.
[49:15.580 --> 49:15.760]  Yep.
[49:16.280 --> 49:16.480]  Yep.
[49:16.820 --> 49:20.000]  So like I say, drink your drink in the middle of the store.
[49:20.300 --> 49:24.300]  I think that putting stuff in your pockets and taking it to the front is insane.
[49:24.680 --> 49:32.460]  But I would love to see you do it from a distance where you don't interact with me whatsoever.
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.020]  I think, though, it becomes funny depending on the item.
[49:35.660 --> 49:40.080]  Like if you have big pockets and you're just putting like a thing like a like a wrapped up
[49:40.080 --> 49:43.100]  steak, like a package of steaks in your pocket.
[49:44.440 --> 49:46.480]  That's this is this is good.
[49:46.580 --> 49:50.860]  So if you get like some like Jenko jeans, like just real big pocket jeans.
[49:51.860 --> 49:53.620]  I love this idea.
[49:53.780 --> 49:56.740]  I think you just pull out like here's a block of cheese.
[49:56.940 --> 49:58.960]  And I think that's awesome.
[49:59.620 --> 50:01.700]  Deli meats coming out of your pocket.
[50:02.200 --> 50:04.320]  Yeah, that's it's not stealing.
[50:05.160 --> 50:05.940]  It's just weird.
[50:07.100 --> 50:09.420]  It's just different.
[50:09.420 --> 50:12.200]  It's weird doing stuff that people think is a crime, though.
[50:12.300 --> 50:18.180]  It reminds me of the scene in the Mr. Bean movie where he pretends to have a gun in the airport.
[50:20.780 --> 50:22.080]  But it's just his hand.
[50:26.380 --> 50:27.140]  That's great.
[50:27.620 --> 50:28.860]  And yeah, it's a good bit.
[50:30.460 --> 50:32.460]  He gets chased all through the airport.
[50:35.040 --> 50:36.320]  What made you think of that?
[50:36.440 --> 50:37.380]  It was it was a Mr. Bean.
[50:37.500 --> 50:38.800]  Was that the start of that thought?
[50:39.260 --> 50:40.260]  No, I was just in the store.
[50:40.260 --> 50:44.180]  I wish I could use my pockets right now without drawing attention.
[50:45.520 --> 50:46.180]  You could.
[50:46.860 --> 50:47.740]  Well, I know I know the technique.
[50:47.940 --> 50:50.900]  I'm actually, yeah, I don't want to go through it.
[50:51.360 --> 50:51.820]  No, it's fair.
[50:52.240 --> 50:55.300]  If there's a security guard who just starts following me and then they're about to jump on
[50:55.300 --> 50:56.620]  me, I'm just like, I'm going to pay for it.
[50:56.940 --> 50:59.740]  But then they're going to wonder, like, is he only paying for it because we're watching him?
[51:00.340 --> 51:05.560]  Have you guys seen those TikToks of those dudes that supposedly Walmart has these?
[51:05.800 --> 51:09.140]  Like, I don't know if this is true, but there's a whole lane of TikTok where
[51:09.140 --> 51:10.720]  people will try to spot them.
[51:10.820 --> 51:15.600]  People that will hang out in the parking lot that are hired by Walmart to follow you in
[51:15.600 --> 51:17.320]  to see if you're shoplifting or not.
[51:17.400 --> 51:20.500]  And they look like they're shopping like secret shoppers, but they're really just there
[51:20.500 --> 51:25.300]  to watch other like specific shoppers to see if they're shoplifting.
[51:25.500 --> 51:27.840]  It would be so cool to deploy two of those on each other.
[51:28.600 --> 51:28.760]  Yeah.
[51:31.260 --> 51:33.020]  Two people pretending to shop.
[51:34.500 --> 51:35.380]  That's so funny.
[51:36.720 --> 51:37.820]  See who breaks first.
[51:39.220 --> 51:40.960]  So how does Apple Pay work?
[51:42.520 --> 51:44.540]  Because there's Google Pay, too, right?
[51:45.160 --> 51:47.280]  Probably the exact same way Google Pay works.
[51:47.560 --> 51:50.140]  Well, you know, the like the contactless cards.
[51:51.360 --> 51:52.240]  Contactless cards.
[51:52.620 --> 51:55.000]  The credit cards and debit cards where you just tap.
[51:55.440 --> 51:56.320]  Yeah, the tap, yeah.
[51:56.680 --> 51:57.220]  It's that.
[51:57.600 --> 52:00.480]  But your phone like decides which card it uses.
[52:01.280 --> 52:03.280]  OK, so it's like if you're using the store.
[52:04.480 --> 52:05.960]  I wonder if I have it then.
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.460]  If I have my card, if my card is saved onto my phone, can I just tap with my phone?
[52:11.840 --> 52:13.140]  If your phone does tap to pay.
[52:13.520 --> 52:13.920]  Yeah.
[52:14.420 --> 52:14.820]  Interesting.
[52:15.140 --> 52:15.340]  OK.
[52:15.920 --> 52:16.620]  You never tried it?
[52:16.880 --> 52:20.220]  Never tried it because I just it's like one of those things where I could just tap.
[52:20.620 --> 52:23.180]  Does your phone have soy oil in it by any chance?
[52:24.360 --> 52:25.580]  Not that I've found yet.
[52:26.060 --> 52:27.640]  I guess that's a required component.
[52:27.920 --> 52:28.120]  Yeah.
[52:28.440 --> 52:35.940]  I think you should leave your cards and wallet and everything at home and just go try to buy
[52:35.940 --> 52:37.660]  something and see if your phone will work with it.
[52:37.900 --> 52:38.600]  Just see what happens.
[52:38.960 --> 52:40.300]  But you can only buy off the end caps.
[52:40.600 --> 52:42.680]  Yeah, see now we're talking.
[52:42.800 --> 52:44.380]  This is going to put everything in your pocket.
[52:45.120 --> 52:50.080]  I had a huge reveal recently, and this was just I last time I tried to do this.
[52:50.140 --> 52:51.900]  My phone was way out of date.
[52:52.620 --> 52:57.800]  I'm somebody who used like a flip phone for a long time beyond when I should have.
[52:58.060 --> 52:59.680]  And then the next phone I got was very old.
[53:00.600 --> 53:05.560]  Last time I did this, there wasn't built in technology to scan a QR code.
[53:05.940 --> 53:07.600]  From going through the photo thing.
[53:07.960 --> 53:15.180]  So I've always downloaded a QR code scanning app, and I just realized that I can just use
[53:15.180 --> 53:18.360]  the camera app that is part of the soy phone.
[53:18.520 --> 53:19.540]  And that has been nice.
[53:20.180 --> 53:22.700]  Not having to have a whole other app for a thing.
[53:23.140 --> 53:27.680]  I think it'd be fun to go into a restaurant and copy all the QR codes on the tables and
[53:27.680 --> 53:29.480]  then print them and put them in a different restaurant.
[53:38.580 --> 53:41.180]  I don't think I've seen QR code technology in a restaurant.
[53:41.360 --> 53:41.860]  Oh, really?
[53:41.960 --> 53:43.500]  You've never seen a menu on the table?
[53:43.620 --> 53:48.200]  In Austin, I actually did an episode of SoulRite about QR codes because they're so everywhere
[53:48.200 --> 53:48.660]  in Austin.
[53:49.740 --> 53:54.100]  In Austin, I'd say there's probably a 50-50 shot your menu is going to be a QR code or
[53:54.100 --> 53:55.980]  they'll have a QR option as a menu.
[53:56.880 --> 53:57.280]  Interesting.
[53:58.400 --> 54:00.340]  It's just like pull up the menu for Chili's.
[54:00.440 --> 54:00.660]  Like what?
[54:02.520 --> 54:07.960]  Dude, if I went to a menu and someone did a QR code mix them up on me, I would be furious.
[54:07.980 --> 54:11.360]  I already hate the QR code menu thing.
[54:12.260 --> 54:16.520]  That's probably my most boomer opinion is that I'm just over the QR code thing.
[54:17.860 --> 54:22.600]  Dude, if I went to Daynana, I scan the fucking QR code.
[54:22.640 --> 54:23.960]  It's like, yo, check it out, Applebee's.
[54:24.060 --> 54:25.520]  I would be so mad.
[54:25.780 --> 54:26.540]  I would be so mad.
[54:26.540 --> 54:29.060]  I just feel like it's so easy to get in between.
[54:29.540 --> 54:34.120]  I feel like you could so easily set up a fake site with a fake menu and a fake credit card
[54:34.120 --> 54:34.420]  thing.
[54:34.640 --> 54:36.180]  I'm always so nervous to use them.
[54:36.180 --> 54:39.880]  What if this is someone's secret lookalike menu?
[54:40.380 --> 54:41.340]  It actually does happen.
[54:41.760 --> 54:44.560]  And it is something you have to watch out for.
[54:44.600 --> 54:50.300]  It's like the equivalent of those things on the front of the ATM pin code things that
[54:50.300 --> 54:51.420]  take your information.
[54:51.840 --> 54:54.180]  Oh, yeah, the scrapers or whatever.
[54:54.620 --> 55:00.680]  It's so funny you say Daynana, Eric, because that was where I had the whole idea to do
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.300]  the So Alright episode about QR codes because I was sitting there scanning that fucking
[55:04.300 --> 55:08.140]  QR code and thinking, when did this become the way we do stuff?
[55:08.380 --> 55:10.900]  Like there was a most of my life QR codes didn't exist.
[55:11.020 --> 55:13.240]  And now they're just fucking everywhere all the time.
[55:13.800 --> 55:15.740]  And they're kind of an old technology at this point.
[55:16.200 --> 55:16.340]  Yeah.
[55:16.600 --> 55:22.280]  I just I hate sitting down with my parents at a restaurant if they come into town.
[55:22.460 --> 55:28.220]  And then now we're all looking at our phones and it's like, dude, this sucks shit.
[55:28.560 --> 55:31.080]  I hate it so much.
[55:31.320 --> 55:32.940]  It's worse than everyone looking at a menu?
[55:33.500 --> 55:35.340]  I yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:35.460 --> 55:39.820]  Because it because it doesn't just become we're just looking at the menu.
[55:40.320 --> 55:43.040]  Now I have to have my phone on and open.
[55:43.060 --> 55:48.140]  So when they come back, I can order the thing right off of my phone menu.
[55:48.220 --> 55:50.680]  And then because if my phone closes, oh, hang on.
[55:50.740 --> 55:52.900]  Oh, I got to get a swipe up.
[55:52.940 --> 55:53.780]  It's too it.
[55:53.880 --> 55:54.320]  I hate it.
[55:54.360 --> 55:55.100]  Just give me the menu.
[55:55.180 --> 55:56.440]  Just I just want the menu.
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.360]  Gavin, you gave me a great idea for a piece of supplemental we could do or just a fun
[56:00.360 --> 56:01.960]  thing to do on a weekend.
[56:01.960 --> 56:06.320]  What if we collect the QR codes from every restaurant in Austin and then we put them
[56:06.320 --> 56:08.700]  in a hat and we play QR code roulette?
[56:08.800 --> 56:09.840]  And that's what we have to eat.
[56:10.140 --> 56:12.100]  Dude, that's a great idea.
[56:12.360 --> 56:13.880]  Like that is so good.
[56:14.280 --> 56:15.240]  It's a great idea, right?
[56:15.300 --> 56:17.640]  You just get 10 QR codes and throw them in a hat.
[56:17.740 --> 56:19.720]  And that's how you figure out that's what dinner is.
[56:19.960 --> 56:22.900]  And maybe there's an 11th QR code that just takes you to the wheel.
[56:24.460 --> 56:26.200]  Oh, yes, yes.
[56:26.820 --> 56:30.280]  And then the other wheel is the other half of the car.
[56:30.280 --> 56:32.360]  Go back to the first wheel.
[56:32.740 --> 56:34.100]  Nick picks breakfast.
[56:34.800 --> 56:35.120]  Do we?
[56:35.460 --> 56:39.740]  Should it be a rule that any time we have options more than like five options to pick
[56:39.740 --> 56:42.160]  in a thing, one of like the sixth option has to be wheel?
[56:42.480 --> 56:44.480]  Yeah, I think I think I think it should.
[56:44.720 --> 56:45.760]  I think the wheel has to.
[56:45.860 --> 56:50.320]  Yeah, I don't like it, but I do think that that is what needs to happen.
[56:50.520 --> 56:50.780]  Yes.
[56:51.260 --> 56:54.440]  One of the QR codes is this takes you to a JPEG of a gun.
[56:56.340 --> 56:57.680]  Oh, Monopoly style.
[56:57.820 --> 56:58.100]  Oh, it's Monopoly.
[56:58.240 --> 56:59.420]  Yeah, let's play Monopoly.
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.680]  I'm annoyed at phones because they're they're so smart, but it's just smart like against us.
[57:06.940 --> 57:11.780]  Like a phone, a phone knows my stupid face, right?
[57:11.800 --> 57:17.340]  It's looking at my face like it might know to play an alarm or ring very quietly if I'm looking at it
[57:17.340 --> 57:18.640]  as Andrew dealt with.
[57:19.080 --> 57:24.580]  But why does it show my notifications to someone else if I'm showing them a video?
[57:26.180 --> 57:30.540]  Oh, I can see it can't just it can't just sit and see like, oh, I'm looking at a different face.
[57:30.660 --> 57:32.300]  How about do not disturb for the next minute?
[57:32.920 --> 57:33.560]  That's interesting.
[57:34.240 --> 57:35.140]  Be a cool feature.
[57:35.340 --> 57:36.300]  I never even considered that.
[57:36.480 --> 57:37.560]  Because I'm always like accident.
[57:37.740 --> 57:39.000]  You know, I'm always like, hey, look at this video.
[57:39.020 --> 57:41.100]  And then like, it's like, oh, someone commented this on Instagram.
[57:41.220 --> 57:43.180]  And then I go to swipe it away and I accidentally press it.
[57:43.460 --> 57:44.260]  Pulls me to Instagram.
[57:44.420 --> 57:48.600]  Yeah, that's annoying.
[57:48.660 --> 57:49.200]  That kind of shit.
[57:50.800 --> 57:57.020]  I, you know, that is a problem that like I've it has never reached a level of problem that
[57:57.020 --> 57:59.520]  in my brain has felt like I need to fix this.
[57:59.720 --> 58:01.000]  But I think that's a great idea.
[58:01.560 --> 58:03.040]  I feel like the tech is already there.
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.060]  Like you said, I don't know what would prevent that.
[58:06.540 --> 58:08.440]  Only show my face my notifications.
[58:09.700 --> 58:12.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that works.
[58:13.300 --> 58:19.080]  Hey, I for the for the record, I owe Gavin and Andrew each a vinyl.
[58:19.700 --> 58:23.800]  Yeah, that's the vinyl count for some Gears of War bullshit.
[58:23.880 --> 58:25.540]  Gears is great for my vinyl collection.
[58:26.160 --> 58:27.300]  It's where it started.
[58:27.560 --> 58:28.780]  I've gotten to from it.
[58:29.280 --> 58:32.980]  You know, when I did this whole vinyl idea, I thought it would turn into some kind of
[58:32.980 --> 58:36.660]  content other than me just buying records for you guys and then us never talking about
[58:36.660 --> 58:37.660]  it on camera ever.
[58:38.220 --> 58:40.380]  There was you guys need to release.
[58:40.520 --> 58:43.300]  You and Eric went to the store and like picked up vinyls and stuff.
[58:43.600 --> 58:44.200]  I'd love to see.
[58:44.280 --> 58:45.520]  Oh, yeah, we did that.
[58:45.660 --> 58:49.020]  You guys could also listen to the vinyls and talk about them or like pick up.
[58:49.020 --> 58:51.400]  You like out of each vinyl or I don't know.
[58:51.500 --> 58:55.020]  That was sort of, I think, the idea for a supplemental around it.
[58:55.140 --> 58:58.160]  But we just we need to get to a point where we all have enough vinyls.
[58:58.280 --> 58:59.600]  Like we all at least probably need.
[58:59.860 --> 59:00.900]  Oh, so you're waiting on me?
[59:01.220 --> 59:01.940]  I guess.
[59:02.000 --> 59:02.240]  Yeah.
[59:02.280 --> 59:02.540]  Yeah.
[59:02.660 --> 59:02.880]  Yeah.
[59:02.880 --> 59:04.900]  You can just buy us all a bunch of records, man.
[59:04.940 --> 59:05.660]  That would be really cool.
[59:05.820 --> 59:06.600]  How many records?
[59:06.620 --> 59:10.100]  How many vinyls does ever has everyone collected from me so far?
[59:10.160 --> 59:10.660]  What's the count?
[59:11.700 --> 59:13.700]  One for Gavin, zero for Nick.
[59:15.920 --> 59:16.420]  For Eric.
[59:16.540 --> 59:17.460]  How many do you have, Gavin?
[59:17.900 --> 59:18.500]  For me, three.
[59:19.240 --> 59:20.880]  Jesus, you're about to have four, I guess.
[59:21.120 --> 59:21.460]  OK.
[59:21.600 --> 59:22.120]  I got a whole lot of notes.
[59:22.200 --> 59:25.480]  So I got like a sax blogs or bogs or whatever you call it.
[59:25.500 --> 59:25.780]  What is it?
[59:25.840 --> 59:26.680]  Yeah, I don't know.
[59:27.480 --> 59:28.080]  I'm ready.
[59:28.920 --> 59:30.120]  I don't need any other ones.
[59:30.180 --> 59:33.520]  I just figured it like once like three of us had one, then it would make more sense.
[59:33.620 --> 59:33.860]  All right.
[59:33.860 --> 59:36.600]  Well, I'll have to tell you what.
[59:36.660 --> 59:37.120]  I'll tell you what.
[59:37.960 --> 59:42.420]  Pick a page between 30 and 900.
[59:43.900 --> 59:45.820]  Let's do 33.
[59:46.820 --> 59:47.160]  Fuck.
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.420]  OK, 33.
[59:49.860 --> 59:50.580]  Uh.
[59:56.120 --> 59:57.760]  Oh, hold on.
[59:57.780 --> 59:59.300]  I'm trying to find anything interesting.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:05.420]  Who won back to back WNBA championships?
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.120]  Not this year, but the two previous years.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.380]  This year it was New York Liberty.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.160]  Who won last year and the year before?
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.280]  Is this just for Andrew?
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280]  It's for anybody.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.480]  Aces.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.320]  Is it the Vegas one?
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.280]  I was going to say the Vegas.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.580]  Eric wins a vinyl.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:25.880]  I won a vinyl!
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:27.620]  There you go.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.020]  All right.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.920]  Asia Wilson in the Las Vegas Aces.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.880]  Eric is on the vinyl board.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.540]  Let me write that down.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.200]  I'm on the vinyl board.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.000]  OK.
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:34.860]  Yeah.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:36.300]  Good for you, Eric.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.280]  Thanks, man.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:40.860]  Gavin, Andrew and Eric.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:41.740]  A vinyl.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.040]  You ever think about how certain names are like a name and also a thing?
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.360]  Shut up.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.500]  Like a Derek?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:51.940]  Shut up.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.260]  You can't.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.440]  You can't do callbacks to shit that's not going to come out for seven years.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.800]  No, it's just what I thought it was.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.080]  What's going on?
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.040]  No, I just it's an observation I had.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:08.360]  When you get to episode 10 of our Gears of War Let's Play, it'll all make sense.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.480]  You ever think about that, Eric?
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.540]  Andrew.
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:16.400]  You know, you know, Andrew never really considered it, but I like where you're going.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:16.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.400]  What examples do you have?
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.700]  You know, like an oil Derek and the name Derek, like that confusing if someone's like Derek
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.020]  and it's like, oh, it's me, but it's not me, Matt.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:27.900]  Anything else?
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:28.700]  Oh, Matt.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.040]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:29.360]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.440]  That's a good one.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.960]  Mostly just Derek and oil Derek, though, if we can focus on that.
[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:35.240]  That's the Derek and oil Derek.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.060]  It's pretty crazy.
[01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.620]  Wow.
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.400]  Is there is there a reason we're focusing on that?
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.420]  No, it's just an observation.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.860]  I think it's a good starting point.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.340]  That's that's I'll tell you the reason.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.040]  That's Andrew's own weaselish behavior.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.140]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.760]  I had a feeling that it was because Gavin is fucking silent.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.860]  Look, Andrew was Weasley back.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.220]  It was back and forth.
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:57.520]  I'm not taking all the blame.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.760]  That was where Andrew beat the ever loving psychic shit out of Gavin.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.900]  Was us doing that, recreating a conversation every time we had to reload a check.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.380]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.920]  Over and over and over again.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.420]  Andrew, should we should we come up with a rabbit slash weasel safe word?
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.420]  Oh, yeah, we do.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.180]  Yeah, the weasel versus the rabbit.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:21.900]  I like this.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:22.700]  I like it.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.260]  I like it.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:23.500]  Yeah.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.560]  A rabbit weasel safe word.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.120]  Yeah, like when we've what would be what would be a good safe word for rabbit weasel?
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:33.160]  On the needle and it's hit a point where it's about to not be a bit, I guess.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:33.600]  I don't know.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:38.120]  I mean, I haven't got close to my limit, but I don't know what yours.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.140]  No, I don't.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:39.740]  I haven't either.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.120]  Not like real.
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.420]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:43.960]  We don't have to be real.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.180]  No, no.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:48.020]  I don't think I've ever had like a real content.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.820]  I had one with Nick recently in the Left 4 Dead 2 video.
[01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:55.560]  That was fun.
[01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:56.220]  Oh, what? Really?
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.600]  Because I kept I was I like to lead the pack, Left 4 Dead 2.
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.160]  And I was trying real I felt like I was playing real well.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.140]  But I was getting shit on it.
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:06.660]  Did you say lead the pack or leave the pack?
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.260]  Uh, lead, lead, leave, leave, leave.
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.560]  Definitely leave.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.320]  But I was I felt like I was doing so well in that video.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:23.180]  And I was really carrying the team, but I wasn't like gloating about it.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:24.720]  I was just doing my job.
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.840]  I was trying to do my best and everything that went wrong.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:28.980]  It was my fault.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.580]  I was getting dogpiled on.
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.820]  No offense, but to carry the team that would imply we're on your back.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.440]  We were still at the start of the level.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:39.820]  You left us three miles away.
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.200]  This is a fake narrative.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.700]  I listen, I like to lead the pack.
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.480]  I like to lead.
[01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:46.580]  And there are times.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.860]  OK, this is what this is what would happen.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.540]  We'll be in the middle of a road.
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.660]  And that game is all about corners.
[01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:55.540]  So I need to move somewhere to get to a corner.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.320]  So I would like run across the street because it's like I'm going to get hit.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.480]  If I just stand in the middle of the street, I got to move to get the cover.
[01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.780]  And then it would be like, oh, Andrew's just written up ahead again.
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:07.820]  It's like I have to I have to go somewhere.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.440]  I have to move.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.280]  You can't just stay.
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.600]  What corner were you hitting when you slam the safe door in Nick's face?
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:15.580]  Well, that was for the team.
[01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:17.880]  That was that was unrelated to the thing.
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.000]  Obviously, we do progress when you're the only one that makes it to the safe room.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.240]  But we lose all our shit.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.060]  Then you get all your shit back in the safe room.
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.660]  There are guns, there's medpacks.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:28.140]  Some.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.460]  There's a lot of good stuff in there.
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.240]  Anyway, you guys were like, oh, you're not communicating.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.380]  You're not communicating when you go ahead.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:37.300]  And I communicated that I was going up to get get Geoff.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.060]  And then Nick was like, oh, Andrew running ahead without communicating again when I did do it.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.020]  And I gave a Nick, go fuck yourself in a way that was like I was I was done.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.880]  I was over.
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:49.880]  I like that it was Nick that was done.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.020]  I will say communication is important to Andrew.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.160]  He felt like Gavin wasn't communicating well enough in a boss fight yesterday.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.500]  And he was that was pretty salty, too.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.440]  Yeah, well, we should wait for something to come out before describing everything that's happened.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:03.980]  Jesus Christ.
[01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:05.440]  I know we're insufferable.
[01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:06.400]  It's so bad.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.480]  Oh, by the way, I finally recovered my left for dead to part two footage.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.360]  Oh, nice.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.820]  So, hey, did you upload that GTA audio that you needed to?
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:17.440]  Yep.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.300]  Awesome.
[01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:20.500]  But with the GTA that hasn't come out yet.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.000]  So that's actually still still you.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.960]  But it's part of GTA month, which we're currently in.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:25.640]  Yep.
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:26.400]  No Nick November.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:27.760]  No Nick November.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.100]  An additional let's play video of us doing a heist every week this month.
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.140]  On Thursday, I believe.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.000]  Every Thursday.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.300]  In addition to that, it is also GERPL November.
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:40.240]  That's true.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.560]  GERPL Friday's coming up.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.700]  What day is that specifically?
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.140]  That'll be November 22nd at noon central.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:51.000]  I'm thinking that we and we sort of committed to this a while ago.
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:06:00.000]  We talked about doing a Mario party on that day to celebrate for that GERP Friday on the 22nd.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.240]  So I like that a lot.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:01.600]  I forgot.
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.520]  Feel pretty good about it.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.040]  I like that idea as well.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:05.100]  November 22nd.
[01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:10.480]  I think it'll just just be the GERPL and the regulation shirt, I believe, is still in the store.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.300]  You can probably buy that right now if you wanted to.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:12.820]  You can.
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.780]  But I think maybe we'll have another shirt or two as well.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.140]  But I don't think so.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.140]  I bought a new dock.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.080]  You bought a new dock?
[01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.900]  Yeah, I bought a new dock.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.040]  I bought a new cable.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.100]  You think the dock was the problem?
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.740]  I was using a third party dock, so I could have heard.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.540]  Oh, now it's now it's all coming out.
[01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:34.120]  Yeah.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.120]  Huh.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:35.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.160]  Yeah, now.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.660]  Yeah, it came out.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:38.640]  Okay.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.780]  I lost my dock a long time ago.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.940]  When I moved to this place, I lost my dock.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.600]  And so I, uh, yeah.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:49.620]  Yeah, I've been using a third party one.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:50.920]  How much is the dock?
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.400]  Uh, the one I bought?
[01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:52.940]  The new one?
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:53.500]  Yeah.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:58.400]  It's, uh, it's the OLED dock, and I got it on sale at Best Buy.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.340]  Oh, sweet.
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:00.620]  That's that's the one that has the ethernet?
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:01.760]  Yes.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.040]  Yeah, the one I made sure.
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:03.760]  Okay.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.320]  So did my third party one.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:09.440]  But it just I I don't want another issue of what happened before.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.940]  So I'm just covering the bases.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.580]  So you're saying your switch battery is good, is fine?
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.820]  No, my switch battery also sucks.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:23.600]  But I think I was people were saying that, like, that dock has like a faster charge or
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:23.860]  something.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:24.460]  I don't know.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.460]  I don't even know what PoE is.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.960]  I just I heard it's better.
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:28.460]  So I bought.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.400]  Prisoner of Elders.
[01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:29.680]  Yeah.
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:30.940]  Oh, fuck.
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:31.720]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.140]  Never mind.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:37.240]  I don't even remember what you would get for beating the Prisoner of Elders, but it was
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.760]  it was important at the time.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:47.200]  That's crazy to think about, like how important Destiny was to me at one point and how not
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.480]  involved with it I am now.
[01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:52.660]  We should record an attempt of us trying to beat the Nightfall so you can get that final
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.980]  piece of grimoire, whatever.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:54.740]  Yeah.
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.560]  I'm missing one exotic nun.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.540]  We should do that.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:01.200]  I saw somebody on my friends list was playing Destiny the other day, and I hadn't thought
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.180]  about them or the game.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.300]  I realized in like eight years.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.200]  Destiny one.
[01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:06.160]  I think they were playing Destiny one.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:06.640]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.440]  Man, it runs like such anus.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.140]  I can't believe we were fine with it.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.820]  I remember really liking it when it came out.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.840]  So it's so weird.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:19.180]  That game left such an impression on me for a period of time.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:23.260]  And then when we walked away from it, I just completely forgot about it.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.360]  Yeah, you know, wild.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.820]  Didn't stick with me.
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.180]  Now, what a fun episode.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.040]  That was chill.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.420]  That was a really feel like we covered a lot.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:35.940]  Probably got to cut about 30 minutes of us talking about Gears of War episodes that
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.220]  aren't going to come out for a year out.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.900]  I think it's good tease.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.260]  Good tease.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.620]  People will forget that they heard that by the time the videos come out.
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.060]  So it's fine.
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.340]  Do you see any Dobermans?
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:48.280]  I saw one.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.560]  Zero Dobermans still.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:53.140]  I haven't seen a Doberman since you started the Doberman lookout.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.300]  Dude, you gotta look.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.100]  Also, if anybody sees a Delaware license plate, that's the last one we need on our 50 states.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.460]  We're racing Bernie and Vanessa right now.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:04.080]  We're ahead, but I can't fucking find a Delaware license plate.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:07.640]  I'll let you know if I see one.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.920]  I don't think I've ever seen one.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:12.940]  But if I do count, but what's the rarest license plate to see in the US?
[01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:18.480]  North Korea, Hawaii, Hawaii, Hawaii, probably Alaska.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:20.280]  Hawaii are pretty rough.
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:22.740]  Rhode Island, North Dakota.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:26.080]  You don't see a lot of West Virginia.
[01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:28.440]  You don't see a lot of New Hampshire.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.040]  Maine.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.220]  I think that's maybe just because of where we're at, right?
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:34.340]  Yeah, probably.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.140]  Oh, you mean in Maine, they'd be much more common?
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.580]  Yeah, just a little bit more.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.480]  You probably don't see as many Texas license plates in Maine as you do down here.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.000]  I think it might be neck and neck.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.500]  Do you guys remember tube TVs?
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:49.360]  Yeah.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:53.680]  Like before we had LEDs and wall-mounted TVs, flat screens.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.920]  I wonder what the very best, last tube TV was.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:05.420]  Like right before flat screens came out and we made the switch,
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.240]  there must have been a really good one, right?
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.760]  Or like the top of the line one.
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.460]  You think anybody still uses those?
[01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.920]  Maybe like a really nice Bang & Olufsen or something?
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:13.760]  Yeah.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:19.560]  I think about tube TVs a lot because it is still very prevalent in the retro gaming scene.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.540]  Yeah, big time.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.360]  Oh, really?
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:21.860]  Yeah.
[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.600]  They're like kind of expensive, like you can find them or whatever,
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.120]  but sometimes you run into them and you're like, why is this so expensive?
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.280]  And it is for that reason, like the retro gaming stuff.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.760]  I feel like England still feels the effects of
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:40.360]  CRT TVs because it used to be that those were just in the corner of a room.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.800]  Like you would point all the furniture into a corner with the TV on some sort of corner unit.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:50.420]  But then for some reason, every house I go to in England has a big flat screen
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:55.480]  still in the corner of the room and not on the wall because it's like fireplaces and shit.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.480]  So I feel like the England living room is still very corner focused.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:01.600]  That's my observation of the week.
[01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.760]  I wonder if that'll be, if that'll disappear after a generation or so.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.700]  Well, yeah, and especially as the TVs get bigger,
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:12.740]  they get closer to the middle of the room because it's a corner.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:20.280]  My issue with flat screens is where I think we all went wrong as a society with TV technology.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:25.380]  Is we embraced like it looking like a picture frame and trying to be cool.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.720]  I miss the dumb ass CRT TVs that just look like insane things.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:34.220]  Have you ever seen the Lightning McQueen CRT TV?
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.520]  And there's so many variations like this.
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:42.200]  There's so many dumb fucking TVs that we just don't make anymore that are awesome.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:42.800]  That's cool.
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:46.620]  TV-VCR combos were the fucking coolest, man.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:47.240]  Awesome.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:50.460]  Yeah, there's like lids and shit and like flaps.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.400]  I did look into it recently to see if there is any company making CRT TVs,
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:00.400]  and I believe there's one in China that is like making new CRTs now.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.160]  But it's not like a prevalent industry.
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.920]  I think they just need to make flat screens that look like
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.020]  cars or whatever, like Garfield.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.620]  Give me like a Garfield flat screen TV where it looks like,
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.380]  like he's hanging on, like he's in like the top left corner,
[01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.700]  like he's hanging on to like the top,
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.820]  like he's about to take a bite out of the TV or something.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.060]  Can you imagine if you could get a flat screen Snoopy-esque TV?
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.280]  I'd get it right now.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:26.000]  It would be him, it would be Joe Cool leaning at the bottom right corner.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.780]  You'd be like, oh damn, he's leaning against my TV,
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.000]  Joe Cool's here and we're watching Netflix.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.440]  It's amazing how pleasing that stuff was to me as a kid,
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.220]  like giant plastic overhangs to make stuff look cool.
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.920]  Do you remember the Pikachu N64?
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:39.860]  Oh yeah.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400]  It had to just like stick out on the side.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.020]  Yep.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:43.420]  Ridiculous.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.560]  It's because it was designed for you.
[01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:52.340]  Yeah, now everything's about efficiency and like this modernist approach to
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.040]  a blank blandness that everyone can appreciate and it's boring.
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.100]  I only think that that is the case.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:04.820]  That's only driven by the sleek modernity is only driven by cheap.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:05.860]  Like it's just cheaper.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.040]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:10.280]  It's just cheaper not to have shit hanging off stuff, you know?
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.360]  And then you trick you into thinking that sleek and simple is cool.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:15.560]  Like look at a fucking Tesla.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.460]  I'm not I'm not trying to get into an Elon Mustang,
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:20.640]  but you get into one of those Teslas and you're just like, where is it?
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.060]  It's it's you just it's the whole thing is just like a piece of molded plastic.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.160]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.160]  Where is it?
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.260]  Imagine this was on your TV.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.840]  Yeah, yeah, that that does something for me for some reason.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.000]  It must have been the era we grew up in.
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.920]  Did you see the little TV that somebody made that it's the Simpsons TV
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.980]  and they put a raspberry pie in it and it just is playing the Simpsons nonstop.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.180]  Like it's every episode of The Simpsons.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.320]  Here, I'll post a photo of it.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.420]  It's so cool.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.540]  Oh, that's really neat.
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.740]  Is that CRT?
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.440]  I don't think so.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.980]  No, there's probably just a little 3D printed.
[01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:57.380]  Yeah.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.980]  I wonder if anyone made it like a tube Gameboy.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.760]  Oh, crazy.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.440]  That would be insane.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.740]  Well, I guess we'll find out when we all get together next time for the regulation podcast.
