[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  Geoff and Gavin, did you see the news?
[00:02.740 --> 00:03.820]  What's the news, son?
[00:04.280 --> 00:08.300]  On Friday, this Friday, the GERPLER is releasing!
[00:08.940 --> 00:09.420]  Where?
[00:10.020 --> 00:12.680]  On RegulationStore.com
[00:12.680 --> 00:13.540]  When?
[00:14.060 --> 00:17.820]  November 22nd, 10am Pacific, noon Central.
[00:18.080 --> 00:21.840]  You see this flyer? I don't know why you're asking me questions, I'm holding this flyer!
[00:22.060 --> 00:23.600]  Shit, look at that flyer, Andrew!
[00:23.980 --> 00:26.940]  It's a GERPLER flyer! Because it's coming out this Friday!
[00:27.140 --> 00:29.140]  And also, look, there's something on the back of it!
[00:29.140 --> 00:31.000]  We're doing a stream, apparently!
[00:31.700 --> 00:33.620]  Where did you get this flyer?
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.100]  I don't know!
[00:35.260 --> 00:37.860]  I was just looking in my room and I found this flyer!
[00:37.900 --> 00:38.380]  Look at this!
[00:38.700 --> 00:40.420]  We're apparently playing Mario Party
[00:40.900 --> 00:42.920]  at the Regulation Pod on Twitch
[00:42.920 --> 00:44.960]  at the same time
[00:44.960 --> 00:46.580]  10am Pacific, noon Central
[00:47.140 --> 00:49.320]  and we're celebrating the GERPLER launch!
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.120]  Hey!
[00:50.740 --> 00:51.380]  Eric!
[00:52.100 --> 00:52.960]  Yeah, Gavin?
[00:53.280 --> 00:56.220]  Is this an announcement put on the front of an episode
[00:56.220 --> 00:58.220]  where, once again, we talked about this
[00:58.220 --> 00:59.940]  in the episode, in the same episode
[00:59.940 --> 01:02.060]  where I was complaining in the last episode
[01:02.060 --> 01:03.540]  we talked about it in the episode?
[01:03.940 --> 01:04.420]  Yeah.
[01:05.100 --> 01:07.600]  That's crazy! That's also on this flyer!
[01:07.840 --> 01:09.440]  You know what else is on the flyer?
[01:09.480 --> 01:12.120]  If you look at the bottom, at the free guitar lessons
[01:12.120 --> 01:13.760]  if you pull the phone number tab
[01:13.760 --> 01:16.100]  Eric's giving free guitar lessons!
[01:16.980 --> 01:17.460]  What?
[01:17.720 --> 01:19.000]  What's the phone number?
[01:22.100 --> 01:23.060]  RegulationsStore.Store!
[01:23.060 --> 01:23.480]  Whoa!
[01:24.360 --> 01:25.960]  We don't need to give a phone number!
[01:27.540 --> 01:28.180]  751
[01:28.820 --> 01:30.020]  The phone number is
[01:30.820 --> 01:32.340]  RegulationsStore.Store!
[01:32.380 --> 01:34.560]  Oh wow, that's great! So this Friday
[01:34.560 --> 01:36.440]  at noon, twitch.tv
[01:36.440 --> 01:37.820]  slash the Regulation Pod
[01:37.820 --> 01:40.520]  to watch us stream Mario Party
[01:40.520 --> 01:42.080]  the return of Dilkong
[01:42.080 --> 01:44.140]  and the launch of the GERPLER
[01:44.140 --> 01:46.360]  at RegulationsStore.com
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.960]  Now listen to the episode where we talk about it
[01:48.960 --> 01:50.580]  in the episode and Gavin complains about it
[01:50.580 --> 01:52.740]  but honestly, we had to do this also
[01:52.740 --> 01:54.580]  because for all the 10 of you
[01:54.580 --> 01:56.720]  who were like, I already knew this! There's a million
[01:56.720 --> 01:58.020]  who didn't. Thanks for listening!
[01:58.320 --> 02:01.000]  Oh get away from me guys! Oh! I'm going back in time!
[02:01.240 --> 02:02.740]  The time machine! I don't know
[02:02.740 --> 02:03.420]  where I'm going!
[02:04.820 --> 02:05.700]  Come back!
[02:06.800 --> 02:08.500]  Eric, when can I schedule my lesson?
[02:11.160 --> 02:11.880]  Call me.
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.500]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the
[02:16.500 --> 02:18.560]  Regulation Podcast. This is episode 28
[02:18.560 --> 02:20.440]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always
[02:20.440 --> 02:22.600]  Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Bedour
[02:22.600 --> 02:24.600]  and Nick Schwartz. Hello!
[02:25.300 --> 02:25.640]  Hello!
[02:26.140 --> 02:28.560]  Very special number. Does anybody remember
[02:28.560 --> 02:29.880]  the 28th birthday?
[02:30.380 --> 02:31.120]  No! Ooh!
[02:31.880 --> 02:33.000]  Playing Minecraft.
[02:35.700 --> 02:36.900]  Yeah, no I don't.
[02:37.560 --> 02:38.620]  Nothing stands out.
[02:40.320 --> 02:42.620]  I actually listened to last week's
[02:42.620 --> 02:43.700]  episode a little bit.
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.580]  I don't ever do that anymore. That's why I made that joke.
[02:46.580 --> 02:48.060]  So, that would have been
[02:48.460 --> 02:50.560]  2016 for me. I could probably see if I took
[02:50.560 --> 02:52.260]  a picture that day. Dude, I bet you did.
[02:52.460 --> 02:54.580]  Oh! It was 2016 for
[02:54.580 --> 02:54.840]  Gavin.
[02:56.640 --> 02:58.640]  I'm trying to think, when did I turn 28?
[02:59.480 --> 03:00.520]  How old are you,
[03:00.580 --> 03:00.700]  Gavin?
[03:03.820 --> 03:04.220]  Thirty...
[03:05.080 --> 03:05.480]  six.
[03:06.140 --> 03:07.760]  Okay cool, so I'm two years older.
[03:08.360 --> 03:10.440]  It's gonna be a long day.
[03:11.120 --> 03:11.740]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[03:12.320 --> 03:14.500]  You said it was 2016 when Gavin turned
[03:14.500 --> 03:16.280]  that age, and I just instantly went,
[03:16.420 --> 03:18.360]  okay, so I was 28
[03:18.360 --> 03:20.000]  in 2016. Let's see.
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.320]  I immediately just went with it like, okay,
[03:24.340 --> 03:26.340]  I guess we all were 28. I just was like, okay,
[03:26.420 --> 03:28.040]  2016, 28 year, okay, got it.
[03:28.600 --> 03:30.000]  I think it was 2003
[03:30.880 --> 03:32.460]  for me, maybe, when I turned
[03:32.460 --> 03:34.640]  28. Also known as 2016.
[03:35.240 --> 03:35.560]  I see.
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.780]  Yeah, the other 2016.
[03:37.980 --> 03:39.320]  So wait, who's wrong? Am I wrong?
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.860]  What? No, you're fine.
[03:41.860 --> 03:43.860]  You said that, and then it just
[03:43.860 --> 03:46.000]  got us numbers confused. You're good, dude.
[03:46.180 --> 03:46.940]  Yeah, you're great.
[03:47.680 --> 03:47.920]  Yeah.
[03:49.120 --> 03:51.440]  This is a rabbit on his heels, man. He doesn't know where to attack.
[03:54.800 --> 03:56.140]  Talking about a rabbit on his heels
[03:56.140 --> 03:56.920]  and attacking,
[03:57.820 --> 03:59.520]  Gavin has become a bookcase guy.
[04:00.300 --> 04:02.140]  We can't spend the whole of this episode
[04:02.140 --> 04:03.360]  talking about Gears of War again.
[04:03.440 --> 04:04.900]  No, I just did a quick mention.
[04:05.540 --> 04:05.920]  Okay.
[04:07.140 --> 04:09.360]  If there is a prompt on your screen, Eric,
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.360]  do you feel compelled to press it?
[04:12.900 --> 04:13.420]  What?
[04:13.780 --> 04:15.360]  Just because there's a prompt?
[04:15.840 --> 04:16.740]  He said yes.
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.300]  On a computer?
[04:19.040 --> 04:21.060]  No, let's say you're playing a game,
[04:21.600 --> 04:23.140]  and you walk into a room,
[04:23.660 --> 04:25.020]  and there's nothing in the room,
[04:25.160 --> 04:27.480]  but you get a prompt. Do you have to hit it?
[04:28.900 --> 04:30.200]  You don't have to hit it.
[04:30.620 --> 04:33.620]  It says all of a sudden it's an X button?
[04:34.060 --> 04:35.320]  There's just an X
[04:35.320 --> 04:37.320]  on your screen. Not yelling,
[04:37.320 --> 04:38.840]  hey, push me, but just like, hey,
[04:39.160 --> 04:40.320]  you can hit it if you want.
[04:40.460 --> 04:43.720]  Let's add to the stakes of this a little bit.
[04:43.820 --> 04:45.200]  Let's say you're
[04:45.200 --> 04:47.640]  three hours into a fight,
[04:48.680 --> 04:49.360]  and you
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.580]  finally beat the fight.
[04:52.100 --> 04:52.800]  Like, you've been going,
[04:53.080 --> 04:55.340]  hitting your head pretty hard against this boss battle
[04:55.340 --> 04:57.140]  or sequence of battles for like
[04:57.140 --> 04:58.480]  two and a half to three hours,
[04:58.580 --> 05:00.400]  and then you finally,
[05:01.360 --> 05:02.940]  finally do it after
[05:03.740 --> 05:04.920]  so, so long.
[05:04.920 --> 05:06.940]  But let me add more, let me add more to it.
[05:07.040 --> 05:09.040]  You've been hiding behind cover the whole game.
[05:09.420 --> 05:10.940]  There's little covers, there's upright
[05:10.940 --> 05:12.420]  cover, there's crouched down cover,
[05:12.880 --> 05:14.120]  right? Suddenly,
[05:14.760 --> 05:16.960]  towards the end of the game, in an end game
[05:16.960 --> 05:19.020]  scenario, there's a little icon
[05:19.020 --> 05:19.940]  on one of the covers.
[05:20.820 --> 05:21.980]  Before you continue,
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.960]  it just feels also important to note
[05:24.960 --> 05:27.060]  that all of the reasons you need cover
[05:27.060 --> 05:28.280]  have now been dealt with.
[05:28.620 --> 05:30.540]  All the cover, no longer required.
[05:31.040 --> 05:33.020]  Because you've dealt with all the things that require
[05:33.020 --> 05:35.140]  the cover. All that needs to happen now
[05:35.140 --> 05:36.880]  is that we walk forward a few feet
[05:36.880 --> 05:38.460]  to collect a checkpoint,
[05:38.600 --> 05:40.820]  so that we can bank that last three hours
[05:40.820 --> 05:42.900]  of misery. But, you know,
[05:43.180 --> 05:45.000]  new button, just as, you know, just as
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.180]  X. It's like, ooh, X opens
[05:47.180 --> 05:48.760]  doors, X opens safes,
[05:48.820 --> 05:49.340]  sometimes.
[05:50.700 --> 05:53.180]  X drops a bookshelf on Andrew
[05:53.180 --> 05:54.300]  and kills him instantly!
[05:54.860 --> 05:57.100]  That's what X does! We finished
[05:57.100 --> 05:58.940]  everything, we're all good, and then
[05:58.940 --> 06:01.200]  Gavin walks into the room I've been in the whole time
[06:01.200 --> 06:03.240]  that I just have ignored the prompt
[06:03.240 --> 06:05.300]  for, and decides, I gotta hit this
[06:05.300 --> 06:07.300]  prompt, and then he drops a bookcase
[06:07.300 --> 06:09.140]  on me, killing me, and we
[06:09.140 --> 06:10.900]  have to do it all over again.
[06:11.580 --> 06:13.360]  That's, to be fair, crazy
[06:13.360 --> 06:15.260]  timing, though. What do you
[06:15.260 --> 06:17.140]  mean? You walked into my area
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.320]  because it was clear, and
[06:19.320 --> 06:21.160]  then you dropped the bookcase on me,
[06:21.220 --> 06:23.260]  and then we spent 45 more minutes
[06:23.260 --> 06:24.620]  fighting things we'd killed.
[06:25.360 --> 06:27.280]  In fairness, I didn't see you,
[06:27.460 --> 06:29.240]  I just saw the prompt, and when I
[06:29.240 --> 06:31.060]  tipped the bookcase over, all I heard was a
[06:31.060 --> 06:33.180]  splash and a ton of blood. I didn't even
[06:33.180 --> 06:34.200]  see that you were there.
[06:36.980 --> 06:37.380]  It...
[06:38.480 --> 06:39.280]  was maybe
[06:39.280 --> 06:41.220]  the most defeat- oh, that's not true. There are other
[06:41.220 --> 06:43.280]  times where we're more defeated, but it was a bad one.
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.420]  I was up there, I was up there.
[06:45.440 --> 06:46.620]  It was unfortunate.
[06:47.160 --> 06:49.080]  And if that sounds like a nightmare
[06:49.080 --> 06:51.120]  to you, audience, well then buckle
[06:51.120 --> 06:53.240]  up, because that was only top five.
[06:53.580 --> 06:54.980]  There's at least four others
[06:54.980 --> 06:55.940]  just as bad.
[06:56.720 --> 06:57.440]  Yeah.
[06:59.020 --> 06:59.740]  Yeah.
[07:00.060 --> 07:01.380]  Not my strongest series.
[07:02.020 --> 07:04.040]  I... every time...
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.060]  So we haven't done
[07:06.060 --> 07:07.840]  much as a full group
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.120]  this week. Looking at the calendar,
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.820]  we had a
[07:11.820 --> 07:13.180]  sink on Monday,
[07:13.500 --> 07:15.500]  and then since then...
[07:15.500 --> 07:16.900]  Well, you and I had a meeting Tuesday, Eric.
[07:17.220 --> 07:19.500]  Yes, and then since then,
[07:19.500 --> 07:21.860]  as a full group, we have
[07:21.860 --> 07:23.240]  not done anything.
[07:23.240 --> 07:25.120]  However, every
[07:25.120 --> 07:27.220]  time I open Discord, you
[07:27.220 --> 07:28.800]  guys are recording
[07:29.740 --> 07:31.240]  gears. What
[07:31.240 --> 07:33.380]  the hell? We've been recording
[07:33.380 --> 07:35.180]  gears for like six hours
[07:35.180 --> 07:37.240]  a day, every day for the past
[07:37.240 --> 07:39.160]  two weeks. It's outrageous.
[07:39.720 --> 07:40.740]  Every day,
[07:40.860 --> 07:43.120]  we finish, and I lay down,
[07:43.240 --> 07:45.180]  and I'm just wiped. And I'll
[07:45.180 --> 07:47.240]  typically have like a 45
[07:47.240 --> 07:49.380]  minute nap, and then be confused
[07:49.380 --> 07:51.160]  as to how we're still in this day.
[07:51.160 --> 07:53.080]  It has been a toll. And then he'll text
[07:53.080 --> 07:55.120]  Gavin and I and go, I'm exhausted, and Gavin
[07:55.120 --> 07:56.660]  and I go, let's start again right now.
[07:59.240 --> 08:01.180]  I cannot get enough of
[08:01.180 --> 08:02.700]  that misery. I don't know why.
[08:03.960 --> 08:04.860]  Oh, it's brutal.
[08:05.100 --> 08:07.120]  But it's so much fun. We're close to
[08:07.120 --> 08:09.180]  the end. I can taste it.
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.180]  Well, we're past the end. Now we're close to the beginning.
[08:11.660 --> 08:12.820]  Yeah, we're close to the beginning.
[08:13.200 --> 08:15.020]  You guys talked about this
[08:15.020 --> 08:17.180]  earlier, where Geoff's like,
[08:17.200 --> 08:19.080]  yeah, we're done. We beat it, or
[08:19.080 --> 08:21.260]  whatever. And then I still don't understand.
[08:21.260 --> 08:22.320]  All I said was, we beat it.
[08:22.760 --> 08:25.400]  I still don't understand what...
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.020]  So you're not... you beat it, but you're
[08:27.020 --> 08:29.240]  not done? Well, here, let me...
[08:29.860 --> 08:30.880]  This could be up to you,
[08:31.380 --> 08:33.020]  Eric. How do you find
[08:33.020 --> 08:35.160]  beat? Is beat
[08:36.040 --> 08:37.180]  finishing the last
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.140]  level? Or is it finishing
[08:39.140 --> 08:40.160]  all parts of it?
[08:40.700 --> 08:42.880]  What are you trying to accomplish?
[08:42.960 --> 08:45.220]  I don't know. Do you have to go backwards?
[08:45.580 --> 08:46.740]  What? Yes, because we
[08:46.740 --> 08:48.540]  started... we thought the highest
[08:48.540 --> 08:50.680]  difficulty was one thing. We
[08:50.680 --> 08:52.640]  completed Act 1, Chapter 1
[08:52.640 --> 08:54.740]  on Insane, which we
[08:54.740 --> 08:56.940]  thought was the hardest difficulty the game had.
[08:57.220 --> 08:58.900]  And then in the second
[08:58.900 --> 09:00.740]  episode we recorded, realized
[09:00.740 --> 09:02.660]  oh, there is actually
[09:02.660 --> 09:04.380]  an even harder difficulty we could do.
[09:04.840 --> 09:05.900]  Let's do that.
[09:06.440 --> 09:08.680]  So none of us have the achievement for beating
[09:08.680 --> 09:10.820]  the game on the hardest difficulty, because
[09:10.820 --> 09:12.980]  we still haven't done Act 1, Chapter 1.
[09:13.420 --> 09:14.820]  So we just gotta go back
[09:14.820 --> 09:17.080]  and redo Act 1, Chapter 1. But we beat the game
[09:17.080 --> 09:18.920]  yesterday. Okay, okay.
[09:19.240 --> 09:20.860]  We did beat the game. That's
[09:20.860 --> 09:22.780]  some Andrew Brain stuff, by the way.
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.660]  That's the way the heists
[09:24.660 --> 09:26.780]  keep going. Where they
[09:26.780 --> 09:28.960]  start and Gavin goes, did you put it on hard?
[09:29.240 --> 09:30.100]  And Andrew goes,
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.300]  uh... I forget.
[09:32.540 --> 09:33.560]  Oh, no.
[09:35.140 --> 09:37.020]  But that'll be... I see it.
[09:37.540 --> 09:38.840]  Geoff isn't out next
[09:38.840 --> 09:40.480]  week, but the week after he's out,
[09:40.860 --> 09:42.880]  we need to sync up and
[09:42.880 --> 09:44.960]  do the same for the heists. But isn't Nick
[09:44.960 --> 09:46.940]  out also? When are
[09:46.940 --> 09:48.840]  you out, Nick? Nick is only out like two
[09:48.840 --> 09:51.080]  days. You guys should hard heist
[09:51.080 --> 09:52.840]  the week I'm out. Yeah. Hell yeah.
[09:53.040 --> 09:54.820]  We'll only have three days of heisting,
[09:54.860 --> 09:56.740]  I think. There'll be... That's fine.
[09:56.980 --> 09:59.120]  You know, but I think we can... Plenty of time.
[09:59.260 --> 10:01.160]  You put a solid six hours a day
[10:01.160 --> 10:02.840]  in, that's a lot of heisting. We can also
[10:02.840 --> 10:04.840]  heist. There's so much heisting we can do next
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.700]  week also. And... That's true. And
[10:06.700 --> 10:08.880]  when this is out, we can't
[10:08.880 --> 10:11.200]  even do anything on Friday, the 22nd
[10:11.200 --> 10:13.220]  at noon, because we're doing a Mario
[10:14.360 --> 10:15.160]  Party Jamboree
[10:15.160 --> 10:17.280]  20-turn Gerpler Twitch
[10:17.280 --> 10:19.080]  stream for the release of the
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.720]  Gerpler at RegulationStore.com
[10:21.720 --> 10:23.120]  or RegulationStore.store.
[10:23.920 --> 10:25.340]  Hell yeah, we are. Just squeeze that
[10:25.340 --> 10:26.820]  into the episode. We got the Gerpler coming out, we got
[10:26.820 --> 10:29.320]  the Mario Party stream. Is that the most turns,
[10:29.620 --> 10:30.660]  Gavin, in that one? 20 turns?
[10:31.860 --> 10:32.660]  I think 35
[10:33.580 --> 10:35.040]  is the most turns, isn't it? Oh my
[10:35.040 --> 10:37.300]  Lord. Oh, Jesus. I just assumed
[10:37.300 --> 10:38.980]  we were doing the most turns. I have no idea.
[10:38.980 --> 10:41.000]  You guys told me that you were doing 20 turns
[10:41.000 --> 10:42.960]  when I made the event forever ago.
[10:43.300 --> 10:44.900]  We can change it, but that's what
[10:44.900 --> 10:46.980]  you said. Do you think there's a battery
[10:46.980 --> 10:49.020]  in Canada strong enough to allow you to
[10:49.020 --> 10:50.940]  play 35 turns? I bought a new dock,
[10:51.100 --> 10:52.640]  I got the official cable,
[10:52.840 --> 10:55.040]  I will test it to make sure
[10:55.040 --> 10:57.140]  we're all good, but I don't think it should be an issue.
[10:57.900 --> 10:59.060]  By the way, I found a
[11:00.020 --> 11:00.940]  picture that I
[11:00.940 --> 11:03.060]  took on my 28th birthday, and it's a picture
[11:03.060 --> 11:05.040]  of Jeremy's desk in Achievement Hunter
[11:05.040 --> 11:06.500]  without the legs on.
[11:06.500 --> 11:09.160]  And his chair
[11:09.160 --> 11:10.500]  without the swivel base.
[11:11.640 --> 11:12.580]  Was that the one
[11:12.580 --> 11:13.820]  where we lowered or raised it?
[11:13.940 --> 11:14.320]  That was the lowered.
[11:15.420 --> 11:18.000]  And then you saw that and thought, let's raise it.
[11:18.620 --> 11:20.160]  God, that was back...
[11:20.160 --> 11:22.520]  Man, budget was a dangerous thing
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.040]  at times.
[11:23.880 --> 11:26.340]  Well, the budget for lowering the desk was $0, so
[11:26.340 --> 11:27.620]  we made up for it that way.
[11:27.780 --> 11:29.520]  And the budget for raising the desk was like
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.260]  8 IKEA bookshelves, I think.
[11:32.360 --> 11:33.320]  The little end tables.
[11:33.860 --> 11:34.700]  We had the
[11:35.320 --> 11:36.740]  scissor lift at the office already.
[11:37.220 --> 11:39.340]  Okay. What was the budget for
[11:39.340 --> 11:41.260]  testing hot dogs and speed?
[11:42.260 --> 11:43.580]  Was that three desks?
[11:44.120 --> 11:45.260]  We had the desks, right?
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.660]  Testing hot dogs?
[11:47.280 --> 11:49.400]  Well, you put the hot dog on a desk, and
[11:49.400 --> 11:51.340]  you raised it, and the hot dog would
[11:51.340 --> 11:53.280]  move faster. Whatever the thing was.
[11:53.640 --> 11:55.320]  There were no hot dogs?
[11:56.260 --> 11:56.660]  Wasn't there
[11:57.220 --> 11:58.520]  a dog on the desk?
[11:58.820 --> 12:00.840]  Hey, Andrew, just checking. Are you okay?
[12:00.840 --> 12:02.620]  I said I wasn't already.
[12:03.260 --> 12:04.720]  Was there not a dog?
[12:04.880 --> 12:06.680]  Wasn't that the item that if
[12:06.680 --> 12:09.200]  on the desk...
[12:09.920 --> 12:11.060]  Wasn't it just a
[12:11.060 --> 12:12.620]  wiener? Maybe it came from dogs?
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.900]  It was just us on the desk,
[12:15.020 --> 12:16.760]  though, wasn't it? It became you guys,
[12:16.820 --> 12:19.100]  but I thought it was a dog thing at first.
[12:19.940 --> 12:21.240]  You had a hot dog on the desk.
[12:21.360 --> 12:21.860]  I don't know.
[12:22.400 --> 12:24.800]  Maybe you're right. I don't know.
[12:24.860 --> 12:26.740]  I just remember arguing with Gracie
[12:26.740 --> 12:28.620]  and Emily for a whole break.
[12:28.620 --> 12:30.680]  I remember you being right.
[12:30.760 --> 12:32.620]  I thought it was a hot dog was the item that would
[12:32.620 --> 12:34.280]  accelerate. Now, I'm
[12:34.280 --> 12:36.580]  looking at the thumbnail, and it
[12:36.580 --> 12:38.840]  is not a hot dog
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.680]  on a desk. However, it is
[12:41.740 --> 12:42.220]  Gavin
[12:42.220 --> 12:44.700]  on a desk, which I think
[12:44.700 --> 12:46.320]  is not a hot dog, but it is Gavin.
[12:46.840 --> 12:48.600]  Gavin, can you confirm not
[12:48.600 --> 12:50.620]  a hot dog? Not a hot dog, from
[12:50.620 --> 12:51.300]  my perspective.
[12:51.760 --> 12:54.500]  You know, it's funny that you guys
[12:54.500 --> 12:56.520]  are looking back at older content
[12:56.520 --> 12:58.360]  from... that was F*** Face, right?
[12:58.520 --> 12:59.620]  Probably? Yeah, that had to be.
[12:59.860 --> 13:01.520]  Because I was thinking,
[13:02.080 --> 13:04.240]  to put this in the context of where we are in the universe
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.360]  right now, we just recorded about an
[13:06.360 --> 13:07.220]  hour ago
[13:08.100 --> 13:09.940]  a piece of holiday supplemental
[13:09.940 --> 13:12.080]  that we have coming out in December, I would guess.
[13:12.880 --> 13:14.180]  And so we took a little break
[13:14.180 --> 13:16.120]  so I could take the dog out to go potty. And while I was
[13:16.120 --> 13:18.000]  taking the dog out, I was trying to prepare
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.980]  for this podcast, and it hit me, this is episode
[13:20.360 --> 13:22.940]  28. I wonder...
[13:22.940 --> 13:24.240]  It's a shame I don't have time
[13:24.240 --> 13:26.280]  to go back. I'd love to listen to F*** Face
[13:26.280 --> 13:28.480]  episode 28 and see what we're talking about.
[13:28.840 --> 13:30.440]  And then see if I could find
[13:30.440 --> 13:32.320]  something out of there to sneak into this
[13:32.320 --> 13:34.260]  conversation. But that just
[13:34.260 --> 13:36.300]  got me thinking, oh, we're at a
[13:36.300 --> 13:38.260]  point now where we've got 28 episodes
[13:38.260 --> 13:40.460]  of Regulation that can directly
[13:40.460 --> 13:42.340]  compare to 28 episodes of
[13:42.340 --> 13:44.060]  our other show. Alright, interesting.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.320]  You ready? Yeah, what's the descriptor?
[13:46.720 --> 13:48.480]  I'm all back! Slash
[13:48.480 --> 13:50.260]  the bat fiasco. Geoff,
[13:50.320 --> 13:52.400]  Gavin, and Andrew talk about Andrew being
[13:52.400 --> 13:53.960]  the most least prepared
[13:53.960 --> 13:56.140]  payoff to the ketchup bet.
[13:56.320 --> 13:58.160]  Geoff's bats and more.
[13:58.580 --> 14:00.340]  So, this would have been
[14:00.340 --> 14:02.200]  at the time where
[14:02.860 --> 14:04.380]  Geoff, I think Geoff
[14:04.380 --> 14:05.820]  was cutting bats.
[14:06.700 --> 14:08.380]  Andrew was proclaiming that
[14:08.380 --> 14:10.060]  he was mostly back.
[14:12.080 --> 14:14.060]  So it's a pretty, probably like pretty like
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.660]  lore-heavy episode.
[14:17.200 --> 14:18.500]  See, yeah, it was...
[14:18.500 --> 14:20.280]  You had all the mini-bats.
[14:21.660 --> 14:22.620]  Did he
[14:22.620 --> 14:24.380]  saw off the mini-bats? Is that what he did with them?
[14:24.880 --> 14:26.080]  No, he sawed off
[14:26.080 --> 14:28.260]  regular bats. I sawed off the regular
[14:28.260 --> 14:30.220]  sized bats. The mini-bats
[14:30.220 --> 14:32.320]  were first. The mini-bats, what I did
[14:32.320 --> 14:34.360]  was I got a wood burner
[14:34.360 --> 14:36.360]  and I burned numbers into the bottom
[14:36.360 --> 14:38.180]  of each one. And then you
[14:38.180 --> 14:40.340]  convinced me somehow that they were coated in
[14:40.340 --> 14:42.220]  some sort of a lacquer that
[14:42.220 --> 14:43.900]  would kill me or smell bad.
[14:44.640 --> 14:46.360]  And it was unfortunately
[14:46.360 --> 14:47.880]  deep in the paranoid era.
[14:47.880 --> 14:49.860]  It was a very paranoid time in general.
[14:50.060 --> 14:52.060]  And so I was on edge.
[14:52.180 --> 14:53.700]  I was definitely on edge.
[14:53.940 --> 14:55.680]  You're going to light all the bats on fire.
[14:56.040 --> 14:57.380]  Dude, I forgot.
[14:57.960 --> 14:59.760]  I forgot about the paranoid era.
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.100]  The paranoid era was crazy.
[15:02.620 --> 15:03.900]  I've got some now. I'm waiting on
[15:03.900 --> 15:05.820]  a 27 pound package from
[15:05.820 --> 15:06.860]  Andrew for some reason.
[15:07.500 --> 15:10.060]  I'm kind of nervous as to what's in it. I heard it was your fault.
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.800]  27 pounds a holiday cheer
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.100]  probably. Yeah, exactly.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.680]  Speaking of content,
[15:16.880 --> 15:17.720]  this is content
[15:17.720 --> 15:19.280]  we just didn't do, not even from the past.
[15:19.620 --> 15:21.400]  I finally watched the Borderlands movie.
[15:22.080 --> 15:23.740]  We talked about doing
[15:23.740 --> 15:25.700]  content around it where we did like a
[15:25.700 --> 15:27.800]  draft of like, based on our
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.700]  experience with the game, what
[15:29.700 --> 15:31.380]  we would anticipate being
[15:31.380 --> 15:32.900]  in a Borderlands movie.
[15:33.340 --> 15:35.780]  What are the touchstones of that
[15:35.780 --> 15:37.340]  franchise that you would need to hit
[15:37.340 --> 15:39.680]  when adapting it? And I'm
[15:39.680 --> 15:41.720]  glad we did that only because none of us
[15:41.720 --> 15:43.760]  would have made any progress in the bingo
[15:43.760 --> 15:45.420]  of it. They just didn't do any?
[15:45.780 --> 15:47.860]  There's not a single fucking thing from that
[15:47.860 --> 15:50.080]  game in that movie. It is insane.
[15:51.140 --> 15:51.440]  Every
[15:51.440 --> 15:53.800]  single game, like the thing I thought going
[15:53.800 --> 15:55.240]  into it is they're definitely going to do this.
[15:55.580 --> 15:57.800]  All of those games open with a music
[15:57.800 --> 15:59.420]  sequence with action
[15:59.420 --> 16:01.260]  happening in like slow motion.
[16:01.780 --> 16:03.520]  None of that. Just skipped it entirely.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.580]  Not a single glowing gun.
[16:06.040 --> 16:07.740]  They don't even open a gear chest
[16:07.740 --> 16:09.920]  in the entire thing. Are you serious?
[16:10.820 --> 16:11.260]  Insane.
[16:11.260 --> 16:13.480]  I actually have 30 minutes
[16:13.480 --> 16:15.300]  left, so maybe they do in the final
[16:15.300 --> 16:15.980]  30 minutes.
[16:16.280 --> 16:19.040]  There is zero
[16:19.040 --> 16:21.120]  moments of a character opening
[16:21.120 --> 16:23.180]  a thing and thing shooting
[16:23.180 --> 16:24.920]  out of it is insane.
[16:25.860 --> 16:27.220]  I don't know who that movie was
[16:27.220 --> 16:29.320]  for. Very weird.
[16:31.060 --> 16:33.120]  I'm glad we didn't do it. I kind of want to do it for
[16:33.120 --> 16:35.260]  Minecraft because we've all played Minecraft, I
[16:35.260 --> 16:35.480]  believe.
[16:37.280 --> 16:38.940]  And that movie, I don't know.
[16:38.940 --> 16:41.180]  Once again, Jack Black, so I guess how could it go wrong?
[16:41.580 --> 16:43.000]  Speaking of Minecraft,
[16:43.240 --> 16:44.900]  I'm still holding on to RatCraft as an idea.
[16:44.980 --> 16:46.000]  Oh yeah, we got a new RatCraft.
[16:47.360 --> 16:47.640]  So,
[16:48.660 --> 16:50.160]  what do you rate it?
[16:51.720 --> 16:52.920]  Two Clap Traps
[16:52.920 --> 16:53.520]  out of ten.
[16:54.640 --> 16:56.400]  Two out of ten Clap Traps.
[16:56.560 --> 16:58.660]  That's another weird thing they did where they had
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.960]  Jack Black as the voice of Clap Trap and they really
[17:00.960 --> 17:02.940]  want you to know it's Jack Black, so it doesn't really
[17:02.940 --> 17:05.060]  sound like Clap Trap, it just sounds like Jack Black.
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.020]  It just sucks.
[17:07.020 --> 17:07.880]  That movie sucks.
[17:08.200 --> 17:09.800]  Does he say skadoosh a lot?
[17:10.700 --> 17:13.420]  Probably. It would fit with the Clap Trap
[17:13.420 --> 17:14.680]  character they're presenting.
[17:15.220 --> 17:16.580]  None of them have abilities.
[17:17.060 --> 17:19.220]  Fuck, it sucks. That movie sucks.
[17:20.300 --> 17:21.380]  How do you not have anything
[17:21.380 --> 17:22.300]  from the game in the movie?
[17:24.400 --> 17:24.920]  Insane.
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.360]  This is the first episode that's come out
[17:27.360 --> 17:29.160]  since the audience has seen the
[17:29.160 --> 17:30.420]  kicker, picker, re-picker.
[17:31.940 --> 17:32.580]  And, um,
[17:33.300 --> 17:35.280]  I love the perspective of fresh
[17:35.280 --> 17:37.240]  eyes, because I didn't realize at the time
[17:37.240 --> 17:39.060]  or even when I was watching it back
[17:39.520 --> 17:41.240]  until the audience pointed out the fact that
[17:41.240 --> 17:43.300]  at no point on either of the second or
[17:43.300 --> 17:44.580]  third wheels did we have
[17:45.080 --> 17:47.300]  pick. Oh yeah, that's
[17:47.300 --> 17:48.880]  insane. We had steal,
[17:49.280 --> 17:50.920]  but there wasn't anything on the wheels.
[17:50.980 --> 17:52.380]  That was kind of by design, wasn't it?
[17:53.020 --> 17:55.360]  Oh yeah, I thought the point of the other
[17:55.360 --> 17:57.240]  wheels was to
[17:57.700 --> 17:59.320]  get you down
[17:59.320 --> 18:01.240]  and out and then eventually you'd have to get
[18:01.240 --> 18:03.300]  back on the first. The second and third
[18:03.300 --> 18:04.880]  wheel felt like punishment wheels to me.
[18:05.320 --> 18:07.280]  At best it was an erosion of progress
[18:07.280 --> 18:09.300]  and at worst it was a stark punishment.
[18:09.720 --> 18:11.240]  I'm just blown away we didn't have force
[18:11.240 --> 18:12.760]  pick from the list on there.
[18:13.060 --> 18:15.300]  That's nuts. Oh, I
[18:15.300 --> 18:16.720]  see. That probably would have been really
[18:17.480 --> 18:19.220]  smart. Yeah, that probably would have been
[18:19.220 --> 18:20.680]  really good. It would have been really good.
[18:21.140 --> 18:23.420]  I feel like what got put on the wheel
[18:23.420 --> 18:25.060]  rolled away from me quickly.
[18:25.660 --> 18:27.480]  Like, I opened up the back of the car
[18:27.480 --> 18:29.360]  that had the wheels and it rolled down
[18:29.360 --> 18:31.380]  a hill instantly and I never was able
[18:31.380 --> 18:33.580]  to catch up to it. I just saw, I mean it's your fault though, right?
[18:33.620 --> 18:35.520]  Like, I don't, I still don't understand how wheels
[18:35.520 --> 18:37.500]  were introduced. You drove the car to the
[18:37.500 --> 18:39.540]  location. Yeah. Isn't there a movie
[18:39.540 --> 18:41.080]  where like a rogue tire starts
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.480]  killing people? I think it's just called wheel.
[18:43.880 --> 18:45.300]  I, yeah, I think it's, yeah.
[18:45.500 --> 18:47.260]  Or tire. Wheel tire?
[18:47.820 --> 18:48.840]  The wheel tire?
[18:49.660 --> 18:51.240]  Either way, yes. The wheel tire?
[18:51.240 --> 18:53.080]  It is called rubber. It's called rubber. Yeah.
[18:53.180 --> 18:54.240]  Rubber. Yeah.
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.060]  Yeah, so anyway, Andrew did that.
[18:57.820 --> 18:59.560]  Uh, I brought the wheel
[18:59.560 --> 19:01.160]  into the...
[19:01.160 --> 19:03.540]  It's like I put the grenade in the room, but I'm
[19:03.540 --> 19:05.700]  not the one who pulled the pin. Do you
[19:05.700 --> 19:07.300]  think, or rather not do,
[19:07.780 --> 19:09.660]  when do you think we'll see the wheel again?
[19:10.180 --> 19:11.640]  I don't know. I feel like you can't
[19:11.640 --> 19:13.360]  predict the wheel. It kinda, it has,
[19:13.440 --> 19:15.440]  it kinda shows up on its own time, right?
[19:15.940 --> 19:17.840]  Yeah. If and when it feels
[19:17.840 --> 19:19.480]  uh, it feels appropriate. Yeah.
[19:20.060 --> 19:21.380]  I want it to feel natural.
[19:21.840 --> 19:23.740]  We could, I mean you could put a wheel into anything
[19:23.740 --> 19:24.460]  and that's fun.
[19:25.340 --> 19:27.780]  It's gotta, it's gotta be earned
[19:27.780 --> 19:29.540]  I think. I feel like it has to be a spontaneous
[19:29.540 --> 19:31.680]  wheel, you know? I don't think you plan
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.920]  for a wheel. Uh, you can plan for a wheel.
[19:34.720 --> 19:35.680]  Yeah, how'd that go for you?
[19:35.780 --> 19:37.700]  How'd that go for you? Uh, once
[19:37.700 --> 19:39.760]  again, I would say that
[19:39.760 --> 19:41.680]  that was barely planned. The
[19:41.680 --> 19:43.620]  wheel really came into play because it's like, how the,
[19:43.740 --> 19:45.740]  what are they gonna be the dynamics of
[19:45.740 --> 19:47.740]  this thing? Would a wheel in space
[19:47.740 --> 19:49.500]  ever stop spinning? Oh.
[19:50.140 --> 19:51.760]  No, right? Like
[19:51.760 --> 19:53.700]  if you uh, if you had a car, you had a car in
[19:53.700 --> 19:55.820]  space, you, you, you floor
[19:55.820 --> 19:57.800]  it, you're at like a hundred miles an hour on your wheel
[19:57.800 --> 19:59.840]  and then you just pop the wheel off. I don't
[19:59.840 --> 20:01.740]  think it stops. I think it goes forever.
[20:02.280 --> 20:03.980]  That's something we could visit in the future, maybe.
[20:04.740 --> 20:05.240]  A spinnable wheel.
[20:05.500 --> 20:07.200]  I don't, what, how?
[20:08.040 --> 20:09.560]  What do you mean? A wheel that never stops?
[20:09.800 --> 20:11.680]  We go to space? Yeah.
[20:11.980 --> 20:13.940]  I'm not talking like episode 30, I'm talking
[20:13.940 --> 20:15.720]  about, you know, episode 700 or something. Well we could
[20:15.720 --> 20:17.920]  simulate space, right? Isn't there like planes
[20:17.920 --> 20:19.620]  that do that, that Tom Cruise was in?
[20:20.000 --> 20:21.780]  Mm-hmm. Yeah, but they don't suck the air out.
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.880]  Which I think is why a wheel wouldn't stop.
[20:24.360 --> 20:25.540]  Because there's no air resistance.
[20:25.900 --> 20:27.860]  I see. We'll just have to wait till we
[20:27.860 --> 20:29.440]  can go to space to try it. Yeah.
[20:29.700 --> 20:31.140]  Put a pin in it, for sure.
[20:31.560 --> 20:33.700]  We have to have a fan who's an astronaut, right?
[20:33.820 --> 20:35.760]  This podcast only attracts the smartest
[20:35.760 --> 20:37.880]  people. And so, take
[20:37.880 --> 20:39.920]  a wheel to space and spin it. Hey, we've had people that work
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.840]  at NASA. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. How hard could it be
[20:41.840 --> 20:43.700]  for them to throw a wheel in there? We're gonna
[20:43.700 --> 20:45.840]  read an email next
[20:45.840 --> 20:47.520]  week that's gonna be like, uh, hey, Annegg,
[20:47.620 --> 20:49.740]  just wanted to say, on the International Space Station
[20:49.740 --> 20:51.800]  right now, love the episode. Gavin is
[20:51.800 --> 20:52.180]  correct.
[20:54.580 --> 20:55.920]  So, would it ever land on
[20:55.920 --> 20:56.680]  Goat's third wheel?
[20:58.760 --> 20:59.680]  What if
[20:59.680 --> 21:01.840]  someday we move past a
[21:01.840 --> 21:04.060]  wheel? What if there's a triangle
[21:04.060 --> 21:05.900]  or a square or an octagon?
[21:06.440 --> 21:07.640]  Well, a wheel isn't
[21:07.640 --> 21:09.960]  a circle. You could have a square wheel.
[21:10.260 --> 21:10.480]  Yeah.
[21:11.820 --> 21:12.560]  I see what you're saying.
[21:13.220 --> 21:15.800]  You wanna get away from circles. Maybe someday
[21:15.800 --> 21:17.240]  we get away from a circle. Yeah.
[21:19.560 --> 21:20.080]  There's
[21:20.080 --> 21:21.320]  a lot of shapes out there.
[21:21.620 --> 21:23.400]  I just can't stop thinking about
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.620]  the scene in Gravity when the debris
[21:25.620 --> 21:26.740]  circles back around.
[21:27.280 --> 21:29.160]  That happening, but it's just Wheel of Fortune
[21:29.160 --> 21:30.880]  wheels. Just spinning wheels.
[21:31.300 --> 21:33.360]  Just ripping through shit. Someone could edit that in
[21:33.360 --> 21:35.040]  probably. Just wrecking all the
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.820]  parachute up in the space station.
[21:37.280 --> 21:39.400]  You see Bankrupt fly by the screen
[21:39.400 --> 21:41.500]  as it chops George Clooney in half.
[21:41.640 --> 21:42.560]  Vanna White goes by.
[21:45.320 --> 21:45.680]  Hey,
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.940]  I have a question. It's
[21:47.940 --> 21:49.620]  non-space or wheel related, but
[21:49.620 --> 21:51.940]  I guess it doesn't have to be, but I think
[21:51.940 --> 21:54.000]  it is in its current instance.
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.860]  Did we ever order those new puzzles?
[21:56.960 --> 21:57.700]  Yeah, I believe so.
[21:59.340 --> 22:00.300]  I'll double check.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.960]  I don't remember if I did or not, honestly.
[22:01.980 --> 22:04.360]  Because it was in the middle of trying to get all the CPA stuff done.
[22:04.500 --> 22:06.120]  No big deal if we didn't, but
[22:06.120 --> 22:08.020]  it popped into my head yesterday, and I thought
[22:08.020 --> 22:09.900]  I should check on that. We definitely should
[22:09.900 --> 22:11.760]  do that still. Who is we?
[22:12.220 --> 22:13.380]  It's me, because
[22:13.380 --> 22:15.880]  that's an assigned thing to me. I thought about
[22:15.880 --> 22:17.580]  it earlier today, because I got an email
[22:17.580 --> 22:19.880]  from Pomegranate about
[22:22.100 --> 22:23.780]  some puzzles that were coming out
[22:23.780 --> 22:25.460]  or whatever, and I put it on my list of like,
[22:25.500 --> 22:27.400]  I gotta remember to get to this.
[22:27.960 --> 22:28.920]  And don't worry,
[22:29.760 --> 22:31.700]  we'll definitely do times, and it'll be
[22:31.700 --> 22:34.000]  really real this time, guys. It'll be really good.
[22:34.540 --> 22:35.620]  I've been looking at
[22:35.620 --> 22:37.740]  on the Xbox store if there are puzzle making
[22:37.740 --> 22:39.660]  games, and there aren't.
[22:39.660 --> 22:41.620]  But there is a computer, a
[22:41.620 --> 22:42.820]  Windows puzzle thing.
[22:43.480 --> 22:45.740]  Puzzle making games? Yeah, like if there's
[22:45.740 --> 22:47.420]  just like a jigsaw game with a controller
[22:47.420 --> 22:48.440]  type thing.
[22:49.240 --> 22:51.620]  There isn't really on the store, but there is
[22:51.620 --> 22:53.380]  a Windows one on PC.
[22:53.380 --> 22:55.460]  So when you open a box and there's all the pieces,
[22:55.640 --> 22:57.060]  you're making a puzzle?
[22:58.240 --> 22:58.460]  Yeah.
[23:01.180 --> 23:02.220]  What do you mean?
[23:04.240 --> 23:05.500]  I just couldn't tell whether you were
[23:05.500 --> 23:07.600]  gonna make a puzzle or like put together
[23:07.600 --> 23:09.380]  a puzzle. One and the same, is it not?
[23:09.400 --> 23:11.580]  He's like, are you creating a puzzle or assembling
[23:11.580 --> 23:12.760]  a puzzle? Yeah, yeah.
[23:14.080 --> 23:15.640]  I would never think of it that way, but
[23:15.640 --> 23:17.080]  fair enough. I see what you're saying.
[23:17.780 --> 23:19.760]  You would never think of it that way?
[23:20.160 --> 23:21.700]  I just, in my head, it's
[23:21.700 --> 23:22.240]  make a puzzle.
[23:23.380 --> 23:25.480]  It's like when you go to sleep and you say,
[23:26.040 --> 23:27.360]  or I'm getting in bed.
[23:27.880 --> 23:29.000]  You're not getting in bed.
[23:29.260 --> 23:31.600]  Like sometimes you say, I'm gonna go
[23:31.600 --> 23:33.620]  to sleep, but then sometimes you say, I'm gonna
[23:33.620 --> 23:34.240]  make sleep.
[23:38.550 --> 23:39.670]  I wish I could make
[23:39.670 --> 23:40.490]  sleep right now.
[23:41.730 --> 23:43.350]  Attend some sleep?
[23:44.070 --> 23:45.450]  I'm gonna make
[23:45.450 --> 23:47.410]  sleep! I feel like some- I'm gonna make sleep
[23:47.410 --> 23:49.570]  would be the most badass fight
[23:49.570 --> 23:51.070]  promo of all time.
[23:51.190 --> 23:53.630]  A boxer in like the pre-fight
[23:53.630 --> 23:55.290]  press conference is like, I'm gonna
[23:55.290 --> 23:57.390]  sleep on Saturday night. I'm gonna create
[23:57.390 --> 23:59.370]  sleep with this fist.
[24:01.290 --> 24:03.810]  That would bring us so good.
[24:04.430 --> 24:05.490]  You think Mike Tyson
[24:06.610 --> 24:08.350]  makes Jake Paul make sleep?
[24:08.910 --> 24:10.310]  Nah, but I wish he would.
[24:10.710 --> 24:12.490]  I don't think so. I don't think any of that
[24:12.490 --> 24:13.570]  shit's ever gonna be real.
[24:14.290 --> 24:16.350]  Jake Paul tricks us every time into
[24:16.350 --> 24:18.590]  thinking that somebody's gonna kick his ass
[24:18.590 --> 24:20.230]  and then it's never gonna happen.
[24:21.610 --> 24:22.630]  This would be the one.
[24:22.950 --> 24:24.590]  This would be the one and I'll be watching it.
[24:24.770 --> 24:26.130]  Fingers crossed, but you know.
[24:26.730 --> 24:28.430]  Yeah, I wanna see it. It's not
[24:28.430 --> 24:28.910]  gonna happen.
[24:29.990 --> 24:31.350]  I wanna see it so bad.
[24:32.170 --> 24:33.930]  What if he puts him in the shadow realm?
[24:33.930 --> 24:35.530]  What if he just does it?
[24:35.790 --> 24:36.870]  That would be awesome.
[24:37.150 --> 24:39.910]  What if Mike Tyson banishes
[24:39.910 --> 24:40.690]  Jake Paul?
[24:41.750 --> 24:43.970]  I was watching some TikToks
[24:43.970 --> 24:44.990]  of Roy Jones Jr.
[24:45.390 --> 24:47.670]  doing an interview with somebody talking about his
[24:47.670 --> 24:49.750]  exhibition fight with Tyson and it was
[24:49.750 --> 24:52.310]  so fucking cool to hear Roy Jones Jr.,
[24:52.310 --> 24:54.070]  one of the greatest boxers of all
[24:54.070 --> 24:55.650]  time, who's like 44
[24:55.650 --> 24:57.830]  and 4, I think, talk
[24:57.830 --> 24:59.630]  about how fucking scared he was
[24:59.630 --> 25:01.730]  of Mike Tyson and how he kept
[25:01.730 --> 25:03.750]  clinging on to him just because he was not gonna
[25:03.750 --> 25:05.750]  let Mike uppercut him and just like about how
[25:05.750 --> 25:07.590]  he changed the way he boxed
[25:07.590 --> 25:09.470]  to make sure, in the
[25:09.470 --> 25:11.790]  friendly exhibition, that he didn't hit
[25:11.790 --> 25:13.610]  Mike the wrong way and give him the wrong
[25:13.610 --> 25:15.630]  idea. Like, it was really
[25:15.630 --> 25:17.310]  funny. That guy
[25:17.990 --> 25:19.750]  instills so much fear into the
[25:19.750 --> 25:21.710]  other best people who have ever done it.
[25:21.790 --> 25:23.690]  It's wild. So I think like the
[25:23.690 --> 25:25.750]  worst case scenario, and this
[25:25.750 --> 25:27.630]  is not, I mean the worst case is that
[25:27.630 --> 25:29.730]  Mike Tyson just gets knocked out and it's really sad.
[25:29.730 --> 25:31.790]  But, this
[25:31.790 --> 25:34.150]  being a fight, sort of like Anderson Silva
[25:34.150 --> 25:35.910]  and Shael Sonnen had a boxing match
[25:35.910 --> 25:38.030]  like six months ago. I didn't watch it.
[25:38.150 --> 25:39.950]  Was it good? No. No, it
[25:39.950 --> 25:41.810]  was really bad. It was one of those things where it's like, hey,
[25:41.850 --> 25:43.790]  this is like a fun, like it wasn't a real
[25:43.790 --> 25:45.390]  competition. It was an exhibition
[25:45.830 --> 25:47.810]  and they treated it as such. Neither of them
[25:47.810 --> 25:49.870]  really went their hardest in any
[25:49.870 --> 25:51.770]  way. And that's sort of like the
[25:51.770 --> 25:53.770]  fear of this event of
[25:53.770 --> 25:55.250]  like, it doesn't really matter.
[25:55.750 --> 25:57.750]  It was so refreshing to hear Roy Jones
[25:57.750 --> 25:59.810]  Jr. being like, that was supposed to
[25:59.810 --> 26:01.310]  be the tone of our exhibition.
[26:01.490 --> 26:03.410]  Of like, let's just kind of box, like
[26:03.410 --> 26:05.770]  not go full on with each
[26:05.770 --> 26:07.750]  other. And Mike Tyson is not capable
[26:07.750 --> 26:09.850]  of that. Mike Tyson has one
[26:09.850 --> 26:11.750]  speed and it is trying to kill you.
[26:11.910 --> 26:13.830]  And it does not matter what the
[26:13.830 --> 26:15.730]  set dressing is around it. He was
[26:15.730 --> 26:18.050]  like, he was making sleep. He immediately
[26:18.050 --> 26:19.710]  punched me in the chest and I went
[26:19.710 --> 26:21.930]  oh god, it's gonna be a long
[26:21.930 --> 26:23.910]  night. And it
[26:23.910 --> 26:25.890]  wasn't. That was a short fight.
[26:25.890 --> 26:28.210]  It was a short fight. And Roy Jones Jr.
[26:28.210 --> 26:29.970]  is my favorite boxer of all time.
[26:30.190 --> 26:31.790]  And it was, he was
[26:31.790 --> 26:34.170]  so clearly outclassed
[26:34.170 --> 26:35.770]  by Mike Tyson in that moment. Man.
[26:36.390 --> 26:37.870]  I'm excited mainly
[26:37.870 --> 26:39.930]  for that event because of what it
[26:39.930 --> 26:42.130]  represents for the future of Netflix.
[26:43.190 --> 26:44.030]  More live sports
[26:44.030 --> 26:45.870]  on Netflix? All about it.
[26:46.510 --> 26:47.350]  Very excited. I'm right there with you.
[26:47.770 --> 26:49.770]  That's their big push for next year. They just
[26:49.770 --> 26:50.990]  signed that WWE contract.
[26:52.410 --> 26:53.910]  Yeah, I feel like I'm gonna
[26:53.910 --> 26:55.890]  watch the, I'm gonna do the thing where I say
[26:55.890 --> 26:57.970]  I'm gonna get into it and I just will never watch
[26:57.970 --> 27:00.070]  it, but I am currently thinking I'm gonna watch
[27:00.070 --> 27:01.930]  it. Yeah, I think just having
[27:01.930 --> 27:04.130]  the option and it's right there, I think, is the big thing.
[27:04.410 --> 27:06.010]  I tell you what, Andrew, if you want, I'll
[27:06.010 --> 27:07.710]  watch it with you. We'll have a watch party, you and me.
[27:07.910 --> 27:09.850]  Do you want to do the first episode of Raw?
[27:10.550 --> 27:11.450]  Yeah, why not, right?
[27:13.170 --> 27:14.010]  Everybody keeps telling
[27:14.010 --> 27:15.910]  us to get into it and that we'll love it
[27:15.910 --> 27:17.970]  if we love sports. And so why not? Why not
[27:17.970 --> 27:19.890]  give it a shot? I'd like to watch it as a kid. I don't think
[27:19.890 --> 27:21.970]  you're gonna love it. I don't think I will either, but I'm
[27:21.970 --> 27:23.250]  willing to give it a shot.
[27:24.650 --> 27:26.030]  You can't be scared to
[27:26.030 --> 27:27.490]  try stuff. No, totally.
[27:27.970 --> 27:28.830]  No, yeah, you're right.
[27:30.930 --> 27:32.410]  Speaking of, like, sports,
[27:32.450 --> 27:34.050]  I feel like, understand, the people
[27:34.050 --> 27:35.830]  that don't, like, that hate sports
[27:35.830 --> 27:37.830]  can be an unwelcoming culture,
[27:38.350 --> 27:40.030]  but when you get to the, like, how
[27:40.030 --> 27:42.030]  ridiculous the people are that are in it
[27:42.030 --> 27:43.970]  and the stories around it is
[27:43.970 --> 27:46.150]  really, like, it adds
[27:46.150 --> 27:48.010]  a level of appreciation to me. That's where my
[27:48.010 --> 27:50.170]  love of sports is. Did you guys see
[27:50.170 --> 27:52.290]  Jerry Jones talking about the sun
[27:52.290 --> 27:52.870]  over the weekend?
[27:55.290 --> 27:55.850]  Nick,
[27:55.990 --> 27:57.330]  did you see? No.
[27:58.650 --> 27:59.930]  Nick's a Cowboys fan.
[28:00.850 --> 28:01.410]  No.
[28:04.130 --> 28:06.130]  Your stadium fucking sucks,
[28:06.330 --> 28:06.570]  Nick.
[28:07.530 --> 28:10.110]  The team does, too. Because they can't
[28:10.110 --> 28:10.990]  fucking see!
[28:11.730 --> 28:14.190]  What happened with it? Okay, so this is
[28:14.190 --> 28:16.170]  Cowboys Stadium has a design
[28:16.170 --> 28:18.390]  flaw, Gavin, where it has these giant
[28:18.390 --> 28:20.510]  windows that, like,
[28:20.850 --> 28:22.650]  magnify the sun onto
[28:22.650 --> 28:24.590]  the field, and depending
[28:24.590 --> 28:26.190]  on, uh,
[28:26.350 --> 28:28.630]  well, I guess they flip sides, so both teams
[28:28.630 --> 28:30.610]  at a certain point in the game have a
[28:30.610 --> 28:32.590]  problem of they turn to look to catch
[28:32.590 --> 28:34.590]  the ball, and they're just blinded
[28:34.590 --> 28:36.570]  by sun. They can't see it.
[28:37.350 --> 28:38.350]  But, and Jerry Jones,
[28:38.730 --> 28:40.030]  the owner of the Cowboys,
[28:40.510 --> 28:42.530]  loves this, and thinks it's great.
[28:42.790 --> 28:44.450]  And he refuses to
[28:44.450 --> 28:46.730]  cover the windows. Despite
[28:46.730 --> 28:48.670]  his star-wide receiver saying
[28:48.670 --> 28:50.070]  we should cover the windows.
[28:50.390 --> 28:52.690]  And they cover the windows for other events.
[28:53.230 --> 28:54.910]  Like, they already have the things
[28:54.910 --> 28:56.590]  to cover the windows
[28:56.590 --> 28:58.810]  if they wanted to. He just thinks a death ray
[28:58.810 --> 29:00.770]  makes the game more exciting? He thinks
[29:00.770 --> 29:02.510]  it's an advantage for the team. Dude,
[29:02.730 --> 29:04.610]  they're dropping fucking
[29:04.610 --> 29:06.890]  wide-open five-yard passes
[29:06.890 --> 29:08.950]  in the end zone because they're blind.
[29:09.390 --> 29:11.030]  Yeah! It's embarrassing.
[29:11.410 --> 29:12.230]  It sucks!
[29:12.510 --> 29:14.770]  It's gotten to a point where Travis Kelsey
[29:14.770 --> 29:16.750]  on his podcast with his brother
[29:17.170 --> 29:18.790]  started talking about it, and he
[29:18.790 --> 29:20.830]  said, it appears that Jerry Jones is still
[29:20.830 --> 29:22.250]  at war with the sun.
[29:22.470 --> 29:23.810]  Oh yeah, it's so good.
[29:24.490 --> 29:26.750]  So, it happened again, and their star
[29:26.750 --> 29:28.770]  receiver said, yeah, over the weekend
[29:28.770 --> 29:30.770]  we should cover these. So at
[29:30.770 --> 29:32.730]  the press conference, Jerry Jones,
[29:32.790 --> 29:34.110]  who's the owner of the team, he's a billionaire.
[29:34.710 --> 29:36.730]  When I heard this quote, I did not believe it was
[29:36.730 --> 29:38.810]  real, and then I looked into it and confirmed. He said
[29:38.810 --> 29:40.990]  all these things. Someone brought up the sun,
[29:41.330 --> 29:43.010]  and he's just in a really cranky
[29:43.010 --> 29:44.830]  mood because the team is bad. He's trying to fire
[29:44.830 --> 29:46.430]  radio hosts for asking questions.
[29:46.630 --> 29:48.930]  It's great. Here's him discussing
[29:48.930 --> 29:50.990]  the sun. When asked if it would
[29:50.990 --> 29:52.330]  be better if they covered the windows.
[29:52.790 --> 29:54.990]  Well, let's tear the damn stadium down
[29:54.990 --> 29:57.050]  and build another one. Are you kidding me?
[29:57.530 --> 29:59.050]  Everyone has got the same thing.
[29:59.490 --> 30:00.850]  Every team that comes in here
[30:00.850 --> 30:03.050]  has the same issues. I'm saying
[30:03.050 --> 30:04.810]  the world knows where the sun is.
[30:05.030 --> 30:06.990]  You get to know that almost a year in advance.
[30:07.410 --> 30:08.570]  Someone asked me about the sun.
[30:08.810 --> 30:10.730]  What about the sun? Where's the moon?
[30:12.190 --> 30:12.750]  What?
[30:13.650 --> 30:14.630]  Where's the moon?
[30:14.810 --> 30:16.990]  I've been laughing so hard at where's the moon
[30:16.990 --> 30:18.910]  for days, all week.
[30:19.090 --> 30:19.810]  Where's the moon?
[30:21.070 --> 30:22.470]  What? When
[30:22.470 --> 30:24.730]  he was asked about the sun, he said it's the
[30:24.730 --> 30:26.790]  largest air-conditioned space in the world.
[30:27.930 --> 30:28.490]  What
[30:28.490 --> 30:30.990]  does that have to do with the sun?
[30:31.170 --> 30:32.590]  So everyone's cool but blind.
[30:34.050 --> 30:34.250]  Yeah.
[30:34.550 --> 30:36.330]  It's very comfortable inside.
[30:36.650 --> 30:38.570]  It's comfortable and you can't see shit.
[30:38.570 --> 30:39.930]  Yeah, but where's the moon?
[30:40.590 --> 30:41.550]  Where's that gonna be?
[30:43.170 --> 30:43.950]  Where's the moon?
[30:44.030 --> 30:46.430]  They know where the sun's gonna be a year in advance.
[30:46.710 --> 30:48.250]  They do. We know where the sun's gonna be
[30:48.250 --> 30:49.910]  when we decide to flip the coin or not.
[30:50.230 --> 30:52.210]  We do know where the damn sun is gonna be
[30:52.210 --> 30:52.970]  in our own stadium.
[30:53.850 --> 30:56.290]  He just doesn't want to admit it's a bad design.
[30:56.910 --> 30:58.390]  Billionaires are so weird.
[30:58.590 --> 31:00.210]  It's like...
[31:00.210 --> 31:02.090]  As people get more money, they get less
[31:02.090 --> 31:04.230]  relatable when it comes to buying things and stuff.
[31:04.330 --> 31:06.310]  And then as they hit their 10th figure
[31:06.310 --> 31:08.330]  of net worth, they just start
[31:08.330 --> 31:10.530]  to sound like aliens. That doesn't even make sense
[31:10.530 --> 31:11.410]  to regular humans.
[31:11.910 --> 31:14.350]  It's because they get too rich to be wrong.
[31:14.910 --> 31:16.250]  Oh, it's great.
[31:16.850 --> 31:17.550]  It's so fun.
[31:17.790 --> 31:20.310]  It was a great... It was a whole thing
[31:20.310 --> 31:21.990]  at the NFL. There was also a coach
[31:21.990 --> 31:24.230]  that their coach got fired and they brought
[31:24.230 --> 31:24.870]  in a replacement.
[31:25.870 --> 31:27.370]  He was talking about...
[31:27.370 --> 31:30.150]  It was the Saints coach and they got
[31:30.150 --> 31:31.390]  an upset win
[31:31.390 --> 31:34.330]  and it's his first press conference as a coach.
[31:34.330 --> 31:36.030]  He's like, I gotta tell you guys something.
[31:36.730 --> 31:38.290]  Started the day, went to the
[31:38.290 --> 31:40.430]  coach's area. Coach's bathroom, never been
[31:40.430 --> 31:41.910]  in there before. Clogged the toilet.
[31:42.730 --> 31:44.410]  That was the start. He just went
[31:44.410 --> 31:46.430]  deep on how he clogged the
[31:46.430 --> 31:47.570]  toilet and is like,
[31:48.130 --> 31:49.150]  it's not gonna be a good day.
[31:49.950 --> 31:51.070]  Clogged that shit immediately.
[31:52.070 --> 31:54.390]  And then his whole left side of his body
[31:54.390 --> 31:55.750]  went numb because one of his players
[31:56.170 --> 31:57.910]  hit him in the back to celebrate the win
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.410]  and it locked everything. It's great.
[32:01.630 --> 32:02.530]  What's going on?
[32:02.530 --> 32:04.490]  It's sports, man. Sports
[32:04.490 --> 32:05.770]  is fucking awesome.
[32:06.470 --> 32:08.530]  I'm sad we never had that kind of thing happen in Griffball.
[32:10.790 --> 32:12.250]  Somebody's saying, where's the moon?
[32:12.330 --> 32:14.350]  Or someone clogged the toilet before?
[32:14.810 --> 32:16.670]  There was a lot of toilets getting clogged in Griffball.
[32:16.770 --> 32:17.410]  Don't worry about that.
[32:19.890 --> 32:20.530]  Hey, I
[32:20.530 --> 32:22.510]  have a story to tell you guys before we wrap
[32:22.510 --> 32:23.370]  up the episode today.
[32:24.490 --> 32:26.270]  You guys remember I went out of town over the weekend?
[32:26.790 --> 32:27.110]  Yes.
[32:28.850 --> 32:30.610]  I went down to Galveston
[32:31.470 --> 32:32.690]  to a little
[32:32.690 --> 32:34.810]  boutique hotel. One of my wife's
[32:34.810 --> 32:35.950]  friends was having
[32:38.290 --> 32:39.090]  a boutique
[32:39.090 --> 32:40.210]  clothing brand.
[32:41.150 --> 32:42.670]  And so she had a pop-up
[32:42.670 --> 32:44.390]  over there and my wife wanted to
[32:44.390 --> 32:46.670]  go down and support her. And it was, I guess, a good
[32:47.390 --> 32:48.550]  excuse to have a weekend away.
[32:48.710 --> 32:50.570]  And I hadn't been to Galveston since I was in middle school.
[32:51.610 --> 32:52.550]  And so we drove
[32:52.550 --> 32:53.970]  down there in Emily's car.
[32:54.530 --> 32:55.230]  Totally fine.
[32:55.890 --> 32:58.070]  It had a fine weekend. It rained all weekend.
[32:58.070 --> 33:00.230]  And I found
[33:00.230 --> 33:02.330]  out that Emily's idea of a party
[33:03.350 --> 33:04.650]  continues to be educational.
[33:05.410 --> 33:06.250]  We went to a
[33:07.650 --> 33:08.410]  the first
[33:08.410 --> 33:10.430]  place we could get a tour of and went to a
[33:10.430 --> 33:12.110]  tour of an old house.
[33:12.650 --> 33:14.290]  Not a lot going on in Galveston, so they're
[33:14.290 --> 33:16.410]  like, look at this old house.
[33:16.790 --> 33:18.270]  And you're like, cool, what's the significance
[33:18.270 --> 33:19.790]  of it? And they're like, well, it's very old.
[33:20.570 --> 33:22.490]  And over here you can see there's a room.
[33:23.010 --> 33:24.110]  And people did stuff here.
[33:24.210 --> 33:25.990]  And you're like, well, why was it built?
[33:25.990 --> 33:28.070]  And they're like, because the people that owned it were rich.
[33:28.210 --> 33:29.910]  And you're like, okay, were they pillars
[33:29.910 --> 33:31.930]  of the community? And they're like, nah, they were in the
[33:31.930 --> 33:33.870]  community, you know, but they were mostly just rich
[33:33.870 --> 33:35.750]  and the house is still here. Anyway,
[33:35.870 --> 33:38.070]  that'll be $15, you know, it was like one of those kind of things.
[33:38.230 --> 33:38.310]  What?
[33:39.510 --> 33:40.970]  It was very fun, though.
[33:42.010 --> 33:43.850]  And so we get up Sunday morning
[33:43.850 --> 33:46.010]  to leave, having had
[33:46.450 --> 33:48.070]  about a day and a half in Galveston,
[33:48.110 --> 33:49.950]  which, as it turns out, is the exact right
[33:49.950 --> 33:51.070]  amount of time to spend in Galveston.
[33:52.030 --> 33:53.450]  And, let's see, Nick knows.
[33:53.930 --> 33:55.150]  And so we get up to leave,
[33:55.690 --> 33:57.670]  and the tire
[33:57.670 --> 33:59.190]  pressure sensor comes on on our car.
[33:59.430 --> 34:01.570]  And it says that I need to air up our tires.
[34:02.270 --> 34:02.750]  No big deal.
[34:03.030 --> 34:05.310]  So I drive to a gas station, and I put a little bit of air
[34:05.310 --> 34:07.210]  into our tires to get ready for the drive. It's about a
[34:07.210 --> 34:09.370]  three and a half hour drive home, I would say,
[34:09.450 --> 34:11.310]  from Galveston. And
[34:11.310 --> 34:12.670]  it's just on the other side of Houston.
[34:14.090 --> 34:15.410]  And as soon as I put the air
[34:15.410 --> 34:17.230]  in the tires, get back in the car, turn it on,
[34:18.250 --> 34:19.410]  the check engine light
[34:19.410 --> 34:21.590]  comes on. And I go, that's weird.
[34:21.590 --> 34:23.090]  Look, the check engine light just came on.
[34:23.250 --> 34:25.550]  The tire sensor gauge went off, and the check engine
[34:25.550 --> 34:26.830]  light went on. And Emily was like, that's weird.
[34:27.230 --> 34:29.530]  And I was like, it wasn't like that all weekend. No, haven't seen it.
[34:29.570 --> 34:31.430]  Hasn't been like that lately. No. And I thought, okay, strange.
[34:31.590 --> 34:33.530]  Turn the car off, turn it back on. Check engine
[34:33.530 --> 34:35.850]  light's on again. Doesn't give any indication
[34:35.850 --> 34:37.670]  of what it is. And this is like a...
[34:37.670 --> 34:39.430]  It's annoying, because the car tells you
[34:39.430 --> 34:41.650]  what wheel has low
[34:41.650 --> 34:43.430]  pressure and what the pressure is. The car's like,
[34:43.730 --> 34:45.410]  your front left tire has 25
[34:45.410 --> 34:47.450]  PSI in it. Fix it. But it can't tell you
[34:47.450 --> 34:49.850]  anything better than an unspecified
[34:49.850 --> 34:51.430]  problem in car, you know?
[34:51.690 --> 34:53.890]  It told you which engine. It did tell me
[34:53.890 --> 34:55.970]  which engine. It did tell me which engine. The only engine.
[34:56.710 --> 34:57.730]  And so I thought,
[34:58.130 --> 34:59.530]  that's strange. Let's just
[34:59.530 --> 35:01.750]  see how it drives. And so we pull out and we drive,
[35:01.830 --> 35:04.030]  and it's going fine. And then I realize
[35:04.030 --> 35:05.930]  I'm having trouble accelerating.
[35:06.070 --> 35:07.630]  Like, it's really chugging.
[35:07.770 --> 35:09.630]  And I'm just in little, you know, neighborhoods,
[35:09.770 --> 35:11.790]  essentially. And so we see an auto zone.
[35:11.890 --> 35:13.850]  We pull over to the auto zone, because
[35:13.850 --> 35:15.850]  I didn't know this. Emily knew this. If you go
[35:15.850 --> 35:17.810]  inside, they have a little machine that'll come out, and they can
[35:17.810 --> 35:19.550]  plug it into your car, and they tell you what's wrong with your car.
[35:20.330 --> 35:21.830]  And so we had the auto zone guy come
[35:21.830 --> 35:23.830]  out, and he plugged it in, and he collected the data,
[35:23.930 --> 35:25.770]  and he went inside, and he looked it up. And by the way,
[35:25.810 --> 35:26.730]  it's Sunday morning.
[35:27.490 --> 35:29.490]  It's probably 7 a.m.,
[35:29.490 --> 35:31.790]  maybe 8 a.m., because auto zones open at 8.15 a.m.
[35:31.790 --> 35:32.970]  We were trying to get an early start.
[35:33.690 --> 35:35.650]  Had to pick Albert up, you know, from the borders
[35:35.650 --> 35:37.550]  at the end of the day.
[35:38.230 --> 35:38.870]  And so,
[35:39.610 --> 35:41.690]  he plugs it into the computer, and he gets the printout,
[35:41.730 --> 35:43.370]  and he says, oh, you have a
[35:44.630 --> 35:45.990]  fuel rail sensor
[35:45.990 --> 35:47.330]  that is malfunctioning.
[35:47.790 --> 35:49.610]  There's nothing wrong with your car,
[35:50.490 --> 35:52.270]  it's just this sensor's bad.
[35:52.390 --> 35:54.250]  And I go, oh, is that a hard thing to fix?
[35:54.290 --> 35:56.090]  And he goes, it's actually not a hard thing to fix, I've done it
[35:56.090 --> 35:58.010]  before with a friend of mine. Takes about
[35:58.010 --> 35:59.650]  an hour and a half, it's hard to get to,
[36:00.110 --> 36:01.890]  but it's not hard to replace.
[36:02.090 --> 36:03.830]  And I go, what happens if I just drive with it?
[36:03.830 --> 36:05.750]  And he goes, oh, you can drive, it's not bad,
[36:05.870 --> 36:07.990]  it's just your car won't go very fast.
[36:08.130 --> 36:09.330]  And I was like, okay, cool.
[36:09.630 --> 36:12.150]  So it just regulates how much fuel your engine's getting or something?
[36:12.290 --> 36:13.850]  I guess, something like that, yeah.
[36:13.850 --> 36:16.110]  And so I go, well, do you guys have one?
[36:16.170 --> 36:18.070]  And he goes, well, let me see. And he's like, no, we don't have one
[36:18.070 --> 36:19.990]  in stock. Let me see. No, nobody in town
[36:19.990 --> 36:22.110]  has one. You're going to have to go to the
[36:22.410 --> 36:23.850]  dealership to get it, but in Texas,
[36:23.950 --> 36:25.510]  all dealerships are closed on Sunday.
[36:25.750 --> 36:27.810]  So he's like, so that's going to be Monday morning.
[36:28.150 --> 36:29.750]  So if you want to get it fixed here,
[36:29.790 --> 36:31.830]  you're going to have to spend another day in Galveston,
[36:31.890 --> 36:33.710]  essentially. And that is a non-starter for Emily and I.
[36:33.790 --> 36:35.350]  We're not spending another fucking second in Galveston.
[36:36.890 --> 36:37.450]  And so
[36:38.330 --> 36:39.450]  we're like, well,
[36:39.870 --> 36:41.750]  we talk about it, and we go, what do you want to do?
[36:42.410 --> 36:43.810]  It's not dangerous
[36:43.810 --> 36:45.490]  to drive it other than it's slow.
[36:46.130 --> 36:47.810]  And I was thinking, I don't want to be
[36:47.810 --> 36:49.790]  stuck in Galveston, even if we could just get
[36:49.790 --> 36:51.850]  it's like 250 miles. Even if we could just get
[36:51.850 --> 36:53.690]  within 100 miles of home
[36:54.150 --> 36:55.590]  and the car broke down or whatever,
[36:55.750 --> 36:57.390]  I could at least get it towed back to Austin.
[36:57.530 --> 36:59.630]  We'd at least be on the other side. We'd be closer to home.
[37:00.910 --> 37:01.750]  Even if I had to
[37:01.750 --> 37:03.530]  just tow to the closest dealer at that point,
[37:03.570 --> 37:05.810]  it'd be way easier for us to deal with than having
[37:06.270 --> 37:07.650]  to... because I was thinking I could rent a car,
[37:07.950 --> 37:09.590]  leave the car here, rent a car,
[37:09.590 --> 37:11.530]  drive home, then come back and deal with it,
[37:11.550 --> 37:13.190]  or take a flight home.
[37:13.570 --> 37:15.570]  There's all kinds of options, but we
[37:15.570 --> 37:17.670]  decided, fuck it. We're adventurous. Let's drive.
[37:18.730 --> 37:19.530]  So Emily
[37:19.530 --> 37:20.950]  mapped us home
[37:21.480 --> 37:23.250]  on not using interstates or highways,
[37:23.550 --> 37:25.350]  so just streets.
[37:25.590 --> 37:27.470]  Because you're too slow? Because we're too slow.
[37:28.050 --> 37:29.630]  And so we take off, and
[37:30.530 --> 37:31.610]  boy, were we slow.
[37:31.770 --> 37:33.710]  I collected some data to give you guys an idea
[37:33.710 --> 37:34.910]  of how slow I was.
[37:36.890 --> 37:37.510]  Let's see.
[37:37.510 --> 37:39.790]  My car maxed out at 49
[37:39.790 --> 37:41.130]  miles an hour. I assumed
[37:41.130 --> 37:43.510]  50 was one
[37:44.030 --> 37:45.530]  too much. That must have been
[37:45.530 --> 37:46.910]  where the regulator came in.
[37:47.230 --> 37:49.510]  To go from 0 to 49
[37:49.510 --> 37:51.590]  miles an hour in my wife's car
[37:51.590 --> 37:53.430]  took a minute and 17
[37:53.430 --> 37:53.870]  seconds.
[37:56.830 --> 37:57.530]  So
[37:57.530 --> 37:59.450]  it took us six
[37:59.450 --> 38:01.210]  hours to drive home.
[38:02.410 --> 38:03.810]  Jesus Christ.
[38:04.270 --> 38:05.370]  I learned
[38:05.370 --> 38:07.110]  to fear and hate
[38:07.710 --> 38:09.210]  any grade of hill
[38:09.690 --> 38:10.670]  in front of me.
[38:12.010 --> 38:13.330]  Every time we
[38:13.330 --> 38:15.390]  hit a hill, I would look
[38:15.390 --> 38:17.290]  down, and the route timer would
[38:17.290 --> 38:18.810]  instantly go up two minutes.
[38:19.250 --> 38:21.370]  A second I hit the incline, it would add two minutes
[38:21.370 --> 38:22.490]  to the trip every time.
[38:23.450 --> 38:25.390]  Sometimes, because you're going downhill, you can
[38:25.390 --> 38:27.350]  coast. So I could get up to 70 miles
[38:27.350 --> 38:28.310]  an hour on some roads.
[38:29.690 --> 38:31.350]  Every once in a while, you get up to 70,
[38:31.590 --> 38:33.470]  and then you hit a hill. No matter how fast
[38:33.470 --> 38:35.510]  you hit a hill, by the time you get to the
[38:35.510 --> 38:37.210]  top of that hill, you're going 18 to
[38:37.210 --> 38:38.410]  22 miles an hour.
[38:39.090 --> 38:41.310]  So I had a line of
[38:41.310 --> 38:43.290]  cars behind me. It looked
[38:44.010 --> 38:45.450]  like the longest
[38:45.450 --> 38:47.490]  funeral procession in the
[38:47.490 --> 38:49.190]  history of the planet Earth.
[38:49.390 --> 38:51.230]  From Galveston to Austin
[38:51.230 --> 38:52.710]  on back roads.
[38:53.250 --> 38:55.150]  And if I was going
[38:55.150 --> 38:57.430]  fast, 49 miles
[38:57.430 --> 38:59.150]  an hour is fine if you're going.
[38:59.430 --> 39:01.350]  But every time I had to
[39:01.350 --> 39:03.170]  stop at a stop sign or a
[39:03.170 --> 39:04.970]  stoplight, it was an
[39:06.230 --> 39:06.790]  unmitigated
[39:07.350 --> 39:09.430]  misery. I cannot explain
[39:09.430 --> 39:11.190]  to you the pain that I felt
[39:11.190 --> 39:13.210]  in my balls
[39:13.210 --> 39:15.570]  and my throat at the same time
[39:15.570 --> 39:17.490]  every time I had to accelerate.
[39:17.910 --> 39:19.370]  And it took me a
[39:19.370 --> 39:21.510]  minute and 17 seconds
[39:21.510 --> 39:23.190]  to get to 49.
[39:23.730 --> 39:25.550]  And then, there are some areas
[39:25.550 --> 39:27.530]  of Central Texas or East Texas
[39:27.530 --> 39:29.410]  where you'll hit a stop sign every
[39:29.410 --> 39:30.970]  30, I don't know, 30 fucking feet.
[39:31.170 --> 39:32.970]  So you're just going like, 2 miles an hour, stop.
[39:33.230 --> 39:34.530]  And it's just...
[39:35.370 --> 39:37.270]  And me just waving people
[39:37.270 --> 39:39.150]  around and having my turn signal.
[39:39.150 --> 39:41.210]  Having my fucking flashers on and
[39:41.210 --> 39:43.370]  begging people to go around for God's
[39:43.370 --> 39:45.250]  sakes. Six hours
[39:45.250 --> 39:46.610]  to get home.
[39:47.290 --> 39:47.990]  Got home.
[39:48.770 --> 39:51.170]  Get this. I just happened
[39:51.170 --> 39:53.310]  to look at the clock. It's 313.
[39:53.590 --> 39:55.350]  The exact fucking time that
[39:55.350 --> 39:57.170]  Howard Stern woke me up in the morning that night
[39:57.170 --> 39:59.130]  when I prayed for some
[39:59.130 --> 40:01.170]  sort of an insight into my life. Why was it
[40:01.170 --> 40:03.010]  313 when I got home? After that
[40:03.010 --> 40:05.350]  nightmare. Is the universe telling
[40:05.350 --> 40:07.290]  me to move to fucking Michigan
[40:07.290 --> 40:08.890]  because that's the area code?
[40:08.950 --> 40:11.190]  Or what is going on? But I'm getting
[40:11.190 --> 40:13.230]  the message loud and clear. Holy
[40:13.230 --> 40:15.390]  shit. Never, never
[40:15.390 --> 40:17.130]  drive from point A to point B
[40:17.130 --> 40:19.110]  at 49 miles an hour if it's
[40:19.110 --> 40:20.430]  longer than 7 minutes.
[40:22.190 --> 40:23.090]  What a nightmare.
[40:23.690 --> 40:25.110]  That's insane. That's
[40:25.110 --> 40:25.690]  so funny.
[40:26.850 --> 40:29.070]  Instead of fast and furious, you were slow and
[40:29.070 --> 40:31.090]  irate. There's nothing
[40:31.090 --> 40:32.070]  exciting happening.
[40:33.210 --> 40:35.110]  I can't even tell you what it's like.
[40:35.190 --> 40:37.190]  Emily would be like, do you want to pull over and we'll switch?
[40:37.270 --> 40:38.930]  And I'm like, no! I don't want to stop.
[40:39.050 --> 40:40.130]  I don't want to get out of the car.
[40:40.910 --> 40:43.310]  We're going to drive until we get home.
[40:43.970 --> 40:44.690]  Zero brakes.
[40:44.950 --> 40:45.990]  I raw-dogged it.
[40:46.710 --> 40:49.110]  There was no point. We just went from point A
[40:49.110 --> 40:51.070]  to point B as slow
[40:51.070 --> 40:53.170]  as Christmas, but we did it. And oh
[40:53.170 --> 40:55.290]  my god, was it a new
[40:55.290 --> 40:57.270]  kind of stress in my life.
[40:57.510 --> 40:59.110]  I wonder if there was like a tech
[40:59.110 --> 41:01.170]  menu or something you could have gotten to that just bypassed
[41:01.790 --> 41:02.630]  the sensor somehow.
[41:03.690 --> 41:05.050]  I don't know, man.
[41:06.030 --> 41:07.350]  What's nice about your setup
[41:07.350 --> 41:09.250]  is you two could have swapped seats without
[41:09.250 --> 41:11.230]  having to stop the car. You could have just
[41:11.230 --> 41:13.390]  gone out and walked around it and then
[41:13.990 --> 41:15.390]  just sat back down
[41:15.390 --> 41:16.190]  and re-belted.
[41:17.530 --> 41:18.590]  That's so funny.
[41:19.150 --> 41:21.250]  Oh my god. Hitting a stop sign
[41:21.250 --> 41:21.970]  constantly.
[41:23.370 --> 41:25.550]  Yeah, and then the next day
[41:25.550 --> 41:27.170]  I had to drive Emily's car
[41:27.170 --> 41:29.470]  to the dealership in Austin traffic
[41:29.470 --> 41:30.630]  at 6pm,
[41:31.210 --> 41:32.690]  which was a whole other kind of
[41:33.250 --> 41:35.310]  fucking insane nightmare
[41:35.310 --> 41:37.030]  to experience, but
[41:37.030 --> 41:37.770]  I was able to.
[41:39.010 --> 41:41.330]  That is hilarious. I would be so
[41:41.330 --> 41:43.110]  anxious going so
[41:43.110 --> 41:45.450]  slow, cars lining up behind me.
[41:45.870 --> 41:46.750]  Oh man.
[41:47.490 --> 41:47.810]  Unbelievable.
[41:49.010 --> 41:50.450]  I love that you just pushed through there.
[41:52.870 --> 41:54.790]  Yeah, I mean, what are the alternatives, right?
[41:55.050 --> 41:57.170]  Either way, I didn't want to be tied
[41:57.170 --> 41:59.010]  to Galveston. I didn't want to
[41:59.010 --> 42:01.050]  be stuck there any longer than I was
[42:01.050 --> 42:03.150]  and I certainly didn't want to
[42:03.150 --> 42:04.470]  have to
[42:04.970 --> 42:06.150]  leave and come back.
[42:06.470 --> 42:08.950]  I just figured if I could get closer
[42:08.950 --> 42:11.190]  to halfway, then everything
[42:11.190 --> 42:13.050]  flips. If I'm closer to Austin
[42:13.050 --> 42:14.950]  than further, then I could even take an Uber
[42:14.950 --> 42:16.710]  home an hour and a half if I need to, you know what I mean?
[42:16.710 --> 42:19.050]  I wanted to get home, wanted to get home to the dog
[42:19.050 --> 42:20.310]  who was for some reason barking in the background.
[42:21.890 --> 42:23.050]  I didn't want to be there
[42:23.050 --> 42:24.930]  anymore. You could have probably pushed
[42:24.930 --> 42:27.030]  the car faster in some of those stop
[42:27.030 --> 42:28.570]  sign points. Dude,
[42:28.770 --> 42:31.130]  you are not kidding, man. Just throw it
[42:31.130 --> 42:32.770]  neutral, just shove.
[42:33.210 --> 42:35.110]  There was a point in, just outside
[42:35.110 --> 42:36.910]  of Galveston, early onto the trip, because we were
[42:36.910 --> 42:38.990]  basically, you know, we're just taking back
[42:38.990 --> 42:40.970]  roads, where I had to start
[42:41.330 --> 42:43.410]  at a hill. It's a bridge.
[42:44.070 --> 42:45.490]  We must have gone
[42:46.650 --> 42:47.550]  11 miles an
[42:47.550 --> 42:49.530]  hour over that bridge, because we just never
[42:49.530 --> 42:51.450]  had a chance to build up any momentum before we
[42:51.450 --> 42:53.430]  hit the incline. It was like
[42:53.430 --> 42:55.050]  the bridge started right after the stop sign.
[42:55.290 --> 42:57.370]  I just remember thinking, this is going to be the next
[42:57.370 --> 42:58.670]  100 hours of my life.
[42:59.310 --> 43:01.510]  Luckily, it got a little bit better after we got over that bridge, but
[43:01.510 --> 43:01.950]  man.
[43:04.750 --> 43:05.470]  I can't
[43:05.470 --> 43:07.490]  stop thinking about the montages
[43:07.490 --> 43:09.370]  in the early Fast and Furious movies
[43:09.370 --> 43:11.530]  when they'd flip the switch and the nitrous would go
[43:11.530 --> 43:13.390]  off, and it'd go through the tubes
[43:13.390 --> 43:15.530]  and fire a chute out. Just that, and
[43:15.530 --> 43:17.370]  then cutting your car going 40.
[43:18.510 --> 43:19.850]  It's just like CG's
[43:19.850 --> 43:21.450]  through all the menu and the piping and
[43:21.450 --> 43:23.690]  the engines, and it's just like, a sensor's
[43:23.690 --> 43:24.150]  like, beep.
[43:25.090 --> 43:26.110]  It doesn't work.
[43:28.550 --> 43:29.470]  That's so funny.
[43:29.790 --> 43:31.730]  Did you, is it fixed now, or what?
[43:32.030 --> 43:33.670]  It's at the dealer. I think it'll be fixed
[43:33.670 --> 43:35.570]  tomorrow. I think we're picking it up tomorrow.
[43:37.350 --> 43:37.870]  It's just,
[43:37.950 --> 43:39.570]  they were like, yeah, it's not, it's just a sensor.
[43:39.570 --> 43:41.470]  It's not hard to fix, it's just, but they're like, it's, we gotta
[43:41.470 --> 43:43.350]  get under the engine to fix it, so it's gonna be a while.
[43:43.510 --> 43:44.710]  So they'll get to it.
[43:44.850 --> 43:47.630]  So you're now in the mindset of, you want just like an old-fashioned
[43:47.630 --> 43:48.890]  car that you can fix yourself?
[43:50.130 --> 43:51.090]  Or some buggy, maybe?
[43:51.390 --> 43:53.530]  I've always kind of lived in that
[43:53.530 --> 43:55.550]  mindset, but I'm
[43:55.550 --> 43:56.810]  definitely closer to it now.
[43:57.330 --> 43:59.490]  For sure. Every problem that Emily's had in that
[43:59.490 --> 44:00.670]  car has been sensor-related.
[44:01.410 --> 44:03.530]  And she's had a few, and I'm just fucking sick
[44:03.530 --> 44:05.590]  of it. Like, I had to, they really pissed
[44:05.590 --> 44:07.490]  me off to know that there was zero wrong
[44:07.490 --> 44:09.090]  with the car, and it was
[44:09.590 --> 44:11.350]  acting up, you know? Like, I was
[44:11.350 --> 44:13.010]  suffering for six hours because I,
[44:13.430 --> 44:14.490]  $9 widget
[44:15.550 --> 44:17.350]  burned out, you know? But the
[44:17.350 --> 44:19.410]  mechanics of the car are 100% fine.
[44:19.570 --> 44:21.410]  And it did make me think, like, I know it's impossible,
[44:21.410 --> 44:23.710]  but God, there should be some sort of a manual override,
[44:23.890 --> 44:25.370]  you know? Yeah. I wonder if
[44:25.370 --> 44:27.390]  driving for six hours with, like,
[44:27.410 --> 44:29.370]  a fuel-starved engine was good
[44:29.370 --> 44:31.410]  for the engine or not. So!
[44:32.210 --> 44:33.730]  Interesting. Good for the
[44:33.730 --> 44:35.650]  engine. Interesting. We averaged
[44:36.110 --> 44:37.750]  six and a half miles a gallon
[44:37.750 --> 44:39.210]  better than normal.
[44:41.310 --> 44:41.710]  Saved
[44:41.710 --> 44:43.750]  gas doing it. We got home in less
[44:43.750 --> 44:44.970]  than a half a tank of gas.
[44:46.250 --> 44:47.270]  And, oh, I also, I looked,
[44:47.570 --> 44:49.470]  because I had a, you know, the odometer kept
[44:49.470 --> 44:51.590]  statistics, the average speed
[44:52.230 --> 44:53.370]  from start to finish was
[44:53.370 --> 44:55.390]  43 miles an hour. Wow.
[44:56.030 --> 44:57.770]  Yeah, so I kept it almost at max
[44:57.770 --> 44:59.030]  speed of 49 the whole time.
[44:59.510 --> 45:01.710]  Now, imagine if they broke it the other way
[45:01.710 --> 45:03.690]  where it doesn't go below 90.
[45:03.690 --> 45:05.370]  It starts and I,
[45:05.590 --> 45:07.530]  it's just super fast. Then I'd be
[45:07.530 --> 45:09.390]  Keanu Reeves and I'd get home super quick.
[45:12.450 --> 45:13.630]  Yeah, you had the opposite
[45:13.630 --> 45:15.630]  of speed. Yeah, no speed.
[45:16.370 --> 45:17.250]  No slow.
[45:17.750 --> 45:18.650]  Only speed.
[45:19.530 --> 45:21.010]  Like Sonic, but the car.
[45:21.690 --> 45:22.470]  You just can't.
[45:24.290 --> 45:25.550]  Anyway, that's why
[45:25.550 --> 45:27.650]  I couldn't, I had to figure out
[45:27.650 --> 45:28.510]  how to get the
[45:29.330 --> 45:31.730]  care packages around town the other day.
[45:31.730 --> 45:33.790]  Yeah, it was the thing where I asked Geoff
[45:33.790 --> 45:35.710]  if he wouldn't mind dropping something off
[45:35.710 --> 45:37.470]  for me for something related to the show.
[45:38.810 --> 45:39.650]  And he
[45:39.650 --> 45:41.610]  said he didn't have a car, but I knew you
[45:41.610 --> 45:43.250]  went to Galveston, so it's like,
[45:43.750 --> 45:45.950]  oh, I cannot wait. I was like, I can't,
[45:46.010 --> 45:47.030]  but I can't tell you why.
[45:48.570 --> 45:49.930]  Yeah, that's so funny.
[45:51.830 --> 45:53.650]  Before we should bring it up,
[45:53.650 --> 45:55.910]  before we move on from this episode,
[45:56.170 --> 45:57.690]  I gotta figure out what my
[45:57.690 --> 45:58.950]  throat goat rating is.
[45:58.950 --> 46:01.130]  We were doing the Gerplers come out
[46:01.570 --> 46:03.050]  and you guys did your
[46:03.050 --> 46:04.970]  own throat goats in the new Gerplers.
[46:05.350 --> 46:07.050]  Did you watch the video? I haven't seen it
[46:07.050 --> 46:08.950]  yet, no, so I don't know the measurements. I felt like
[46:08.950 --> 46:09.910]  going in dark
[46:11.370 --> 46:12.890]  would be best for this.
[46:13.330 --> 46:15.070]  Okay, well, do you have a Gerpler
[46:16.490 --> 46:17.250]  in front of you?
[46:17.590 --> 46:19.130]  I do, yes. What color
[46:19.130 --> 46:21.010]  is it? It is the
[46:21.010 --> 46:22.770]  green Gerpler. Oh, perfect.
[46:22.910 --> 46:24.590]  That's great, that's what we use. That's fantastic.
[46:25.210 --> 46:27.230]  It wasn't going to be able to be an
[46:28.130 --> 46:28.490]  official...
[46:29.410 --> 46:31.230]  Does anyone have the
[46:31.230 --> 46:33.270]  ability to take a screenshot from
[46:33.270 --> 46:34.990]  that video of the final
[46:34.990 --> 46:37.350]  lines and we can put it up after Andrew tells us his?
[46:37.470 --> 46:39.170]  I think I can. After
[46:39.170 --> 46:40.890]  we get it from Andrew, I think I can do it.
[46:41.750 --> 46:43.190]  I have a measuring cup
[46:43.190 --> 46:44.830]  to be very specific as well.
[46:44.910 --> 46:47.230]  Oh, we weren't very specific. Yeah, we don't.
[46:47.390 --> 46:49.070]  Right, but what we did, let me
[46:49.070 --> 46:51.170]  explain to you what we did. We
[46:52.190 --> 46:53.070]  put as much
[46:53.070 --> 46:54.710]  water in our mouth, it was individual,
[46:54.710 --> 46:56.710]  so say Gavin would go, he'd put
[46:56.710 --> 46:58.590]  as much water as he could physically hold
[46:58.590 --> 47:00.870]  in his mouth, gullet,
[47:01.110 --> 47:01.830]  throat, etc.
[47:02.290 --> 47:04.350]  As much as he could physically hold.
[47:04.810 --> 47:06.750]  Then, he would
[47:06.750 --> 47:08.070]  spit it into
[47:09.510 --> 47:10.550]  the measuring
[47:10.550 --> 47:12.570]  cup and then
[47:12.570 --> 47:14.730]  from the measuring cup into
[47:15.510 --> 47:16.750]  we would pour it
[47:16.750 --> 47:18.650]  into the Gerpler and then we would mark a line on the
[47:18.650 --> 47:20.870]  Gerpler. That's the way that went, right?
[47:21.050 --> 47:21.310]  Yeah.
[47:21.310 --> 47:23.530]  So from
[47:23.530 --> 47:25.330]  there, what I need you to do
[47:25.970 --> 47:27.870]  is make a line
[47:27.870 --> 47:29.470]  next to, I'm
[47:29.470 --> 47:31.410]  watching the video now, next
[47:31.410 --> 47:32.890]  to the letters
[47:33.390 --> 47:35.430]  by the Gerpler, not on
[47:35.430 --> 47:37.470]  top of the white letters, but right next to it.
[47:37.750 --> 47:39.370]  Make a little black mark and then
[47:39.370 --> 47:40.990]  send us the picture, that's what we're looking at.
[47:41.490 --> 47:43.290]  Okay, I'm gonna first put
[47:43.290 --> 47:44.210]  the water in the mouth.
[47:45.150 --> 47:46.890]  Gotta stretch the cheeks out a little bit.
[47:47.290 --> 47:48.870]  Are you doing
[47:48.870 --> 47:50.830]  cold water? Hot water? What are you doing?
[47:51.990 --> 47:53.110]  Pour it out cold.
[47:53.230 --> 47:54.090]  I'd say room temp.
[47:55.670 --> 47:56.710]  Probably smart.
[47:56.950 --> 47:59.030]  A little cheek
[47:59.030 --> 47:59.430]  stretch.
[48:01.190 --> 48:01.390]  Yep.
[48:02.630 --> 48:03.790]  Make sure we got room.
[48:05.870 --> 48:06.950]  Okay, here we go.
[48:09.990 --> 48:11.050]  I imagine it's going
[48:11.050 --> 48:11.430]  in now.
[48:15.790 --> 48:16.990]  Make a lot of sounds.
[48:16.990 --> 48:18.550]  Lots of choking noise.
[48:20.070 --> 48:21.030]  Is he gonna try
[48:21.030 --> 48:21.870]  and squeeze a bit more in?
[48:23.230 --> 48:24.850]  I think he's done it.
[48:31.700 --> 48:32.700]  Oh my god,
[48:32.800 --> 48:33.720]  you can hear it.
[48:36.400 --> 48:36.840]  Sorry.
[48:38.140 --> 48:38.680]  Sound like you got
[48:38.680 --> 48:39.100]  a lot in.
[48:40.220 --> 48:42.560]  I kept, I'd fill my mouth
[48:42.560 --> 48:44.560]  and then I'd just instinctually start
[48:44.560 --> 48:46.140]  drinking it a little bit and then I'd go
[48:46.140 --> 48:47.320]  oh, there's more room.
[48:48.400 --> 48:50.060]  I think everyone did that in our main video.
[48:50.060 --> 48:51.160]  Everyone's like, oh, I'm just drinking.
[48:52.380 --> 48:52.840]  Okay.
[48:53.540 --> 48:54.360]  Pouring it in.
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.920]  Let me first just see how much it is
[48:57.920 --> 48:58.420]  in the cup.
[48:59.780 --> 49:00.760]  Interesting. Okay.
[49:03.760 --> 49:06.040]  Andrew, do you have any predictions on where you'll rank
[49:06.040 --> 49:06.700]  within the group?
[49:07.580 --> 49:09.400]  I think I'm gonna be
[49:09.980 --> 49:10.980]  at the bottom.
[49:11.580 --> 49:13.720]  Oh. Big back, small mouth.
[49:14.140 --> 49:14.380]  Yeah.
[49:15.480 --> 49:17.120]  I think I have a small mouth.
[49:19.060 --> 49:20.420]  Would you say your throat
[49:20.420 --> 49:21.000]  is petite?
[49:22.460 --> 49:24.200]  Yeah, I think I do have a petite throat.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.100]  Okay.
[49:31.500 --> 49:33.400]  Let me make sure this is level.
[49:37.680 --> 49:40.140]  I don't even need to mark. It's so perfect
[49:40.140 --> 49:41.200]  for where mine is.
[49:42.020 --> 49:43.860]  Which also makes me feel like I'm very
[49:43.860 --> 49:44.460]  low.
[49:44.600 --> 49:47.240]  I hope it's at the L.
[49:50.440 --> 49:51.920]  Yeah. Guys, I'm only
[49:51.920 --> 49:53.440]  into the middle of the U.
[49:56.180 --> 49:57.060]  My bar
[49:58.060 --> 49:58.940]  directly touches
[49:59.620 --> 50:00.760]  the first R.
[50:01.540 --> 50:01.900]  Okay.
[50:03.700 --> 50:04.880]  Could you soy phone it?
[50:06.300 --> 50:06.740]  Yeah.
[50:07.920 --> 50:09.680]  One sec. Let me take a...
[50:10.620 --> 50:12.160]  Now, if you...
[50:12.160 --> 50:13.760]  Eric, if you haven't already taken
[50:13.760 --> 50:15.660]  a screenshot, I can just...
[50:15.660 --> 50:17.920]  Oh, okay. I was gonna say, I have the Gerpler. I can just go grab it.
[50:17.920 --> 50:19.660]  Oh, Geoff. You fool.
[50:20.860 --> 50:21.660]  I have it.
[50:21.880 --> 50:22.680]  I'm ready to share.
[50:23.480 --> 50:24.800]  I'm uploading the photo right now.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.080]  Okay. Excited to see it.
[50:27.340 --> 50:28.040]  Yeah, as am I.
[50:29.340 --> 50:29.740]  Okay.
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.980]  Kind of weird that it's at an angle.
[50:33.440 --> 50:34.680]  Might be an angle, but that's fine.
[50:34.760 --> 50:36.380]  Worst photo I've ever seen.
[50:37.060 --> 50:39.380]  Kind of like the most insane way
[50:39.380 --> 50:40.180]  you could have taken that picture.
[50:40.720 --> 50:42.180]  What would be the better way to do it?
[50:42.360 --> 50:43.120]  Here, let me show you.
[50:43.120 --> 50:45.240]  Full on.
[50:46.140 --> 50:47.380]  Just straight on.
[50:48.340 --> 50:48.820]  So...
[50:48.820 --> 50:51.560]  Andrew is...
[50:51.560 --> 50:53.480]  is just under Gavin
[50:53.480 --> 50:53.960]  and I.
[50:54.320 --> 50:57.340]  So the G that's all the way to the left
[50:57.340 --> 50:59.620]  is Gavin. The G that's all the way to the right
[50:59.620 --> 51:00.280]  is Geoff.
[51:01.500 --> 51:03.060]  Yeah, I'm definitely below. I'm not...
[51:03.060 --> 51:04.820]  It's like barely touching. Here, let me...
[51:04.820 --> 51:06.440]  So now we've got full genga.
[51:07.020 --> 51:07.460]  We're genga?
[51:08.880 --> 51:10.320]  Our mouths are genga.
[51:10.320 --> 51:11.760]  I don't know about that.
[51:12.100 --> 51:13.020]  I don't know if I like that one.
[51:13.320 --> 51:15.100]  We should make a board game called Genga.
[51:15.560 --> 51:16.160]  Genga Mouth.
[51:19.020 --> 51:20.460]  We could be the next Smash Mouth.
[51:20.980 --> 51:22.420]  Here we go. Better angle for you guys.
[51:23.360 --> 51:25.520]  I thought I did a good job. Apparently I didn't.
[51:25.740 --> 51:26.720]  People are picky nowadays.
[51:27.840 --> 51:28.380]  It's the photography.
[51:33.250 --> 51:34.490]  Yeah, do you see the difference
[51:34.490 --> 51:36.650]  between what you did the first time and what you did the second time?
[51:37.630 --> 51:37.990]  Phenomenal.
[51:38.190 --> 51:40.390]  The water level is now... we can see how much
[51:40.390 --> 51:41.650]  further below it is.
[51:41.650 --> 51:42.910]  It's essentially the same.
[51:43.530 --> 51:44.610]  I'm excited for the audience to see these.
[51:45.210 --> 51:46.810]  Andrew, I think you're dead last.
[51:47.130 --> 51:48.050]  Yeah, I'm definitely last.
[51:49.070 --> 51:50.590]  Not even close, buddy.
[51:51.810 --> 51:53.530]  You got your puzzle under the laptop.
[51:55.130 --> 51:56.430]  We talked about this before.
[51:57.470 --> 51:58.430]  With my Norm movies.
[52:02.130 --> 52:03.550]  Ventilation isn't as good with the puzzle.
[52:04.150 --> 52:04.850]  It still overheats.
[52:07.750 --> 52:09.210]  Have you tried it just on the desk?
[52:14.140 --> 52:14.580]  No.
[52:14.820 --> 52:16.480]  Why did you give such a big...
[52:16.480 --> 52:17.740]  You don't want it just on the desk?
[52:18.100 --> 52:19.540]  Are you saving the desk or what?
[52:20.640 --> 52:22.980]  I was thinking why I haven't done that.
[52:23.160 --> 52:24.500]  That was the thing.
[52:25.080 --> 52:26.600]  No, I haven't done that.
[52:26.780 --> 52:27.320]  And why?
[52:27.680 --> 52:28.860]  There has to be a reason.
[52:28.880 --> 52:29.780]  At the laptop store.
[52:30.400 --> 52:33.700]  Where's all the platforms and boxes and puzzles and shit to put this on?
[52:34.080 --> 52:35.620]  Okay, so I think this is what happened.
[52:35.900 --> 52:38.900]  I'm now remembering the sequence of events that led to this moment.
[52:39.380 --> 52:42.080]  I originally was level on the desk.
[52:42.080 --> 52:43.760]  And then it was really overheating.
[52:43.860 --> 52:46.460]  And I thought maybe some elevation would help it.
[52:46.860 --> 52:49.180]  So then I put the Norm DVDs under it.
[52:49.620 --> 52:52.200]  Then I wanted to take the Norm DVDs back.
[52:52.300 --> 52:53.480]  And I got the puzzle box.
[52:54.120 --> 52:55.780]  And I think I just...
[52:55.780 --> 52:57.500]  I just swapped it.
[52:57.540 --> 52:58.860]  Because I had something there before.
[52:59.620 --> 53:01.040]  I don't think it has to be on this.
[53:01.260 --> 53:03.520]  When you type on it though, doesn't it just go like...
[53:03.520 --> 53:04.860]  Like bouncing all around?
[53:05.880 --> 53:06.520]  What do you mean?
[53:07.160 --> 53:08.320]  Because you're balancing it.
[53:09.260 --> 53:09.740]  Well, no.
[53:09.820 --> 53:13.840]  The puzzle box is essentially the same size as the laptop.
[53:13.840 --> 53:14.980]  You can see the...
[53:14.980 --> 53:15.340]  Like...
[53:16.680 --> 53:17.400]  Giant overhang.
[53:18.280 --> 53:21.040]  Well, I don't use the right side of the keyboard that much, I guess.
[53:21.180 --> 53:21.400]  I don't know.
[53:22.380 --> 53:24.060]  Yeah, I'm not typing all the way on the edge.
[53:24.300 --> 53:24.740]  It's more middle.
[53:28.820 --> 53:31.260]  I'm constantly not using the question mark.
[53:31.440 --> 53:32.720]  So, I mean, that's just over there.
[53:32.920 --> 53:36.180]  Yeah, I'm looking at where the line is on the puzzle box to the keys.
[53:36.260 --> 53:38.300]  And it is halfway through the inner key on the right.
[53:38.300 --> 53:39.180]  Okay.
[53:39.580 --> 53:42.000]  I just like the idea of being like, oh, I can't ask any questions
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.560]  because my laptop will fall over.
[53:45.480 --> 53:46.000]  No.
[53:47.120 --> 53:47.820]  But I'm improving!
[53:48.260 --> 53:50.240]  I plugged in my external drive
[53:50.240 --> 53:52.240]  and I transferred all of the stuff
[53:52.240 --> 53:53.480]  onto it and then deleted
[53:54.020 --> 53:55.840]  on my computer. I'm learning.
[53:56.320 --> 53:56.980]  Hell yeah, dude.
[53:57.460 --> 53:58.540]  Learning how to do stuff.
[53:59.400 --> 54:02.200]  I mean, I would say that's a concept that also works
[54:02.200 --> 54:03.120]  outside of computers.
[54:03.940 --> 54:04.720]  Like what?
[54:05.860 --> 54:06.960]  Like storing something
[54:06.960 --> 54:08.140]  in a cupboard or something?
[54:09.140 --> 54:10.580]  Yeah, he's got you there.
[54:10.880 --> 54:12.280]  Yeah, I don't understand.
[54:12.920 --> 54:14.340]  Like something that was out
[54:14.340 --> 54:16.480]  and you were using and then it's like, oh, I don't need that anymore
[54:16.480 --> 54:17.140]  so I'll put it away.
[54:17.720 --> 54:17.960]  Yeah.
[54:21.080 --> 54:22.640]  What's the implication? That I don't?
[54:23.560 --> 54:24.940]  No, that's just what you were doing
[54:24.940 --> 54:25.420]  with files.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.780]  You're making it sound like you just learned about copying files
[54:28.780 --> 54:29.720]  onto an external drive.
[54:30.620 --> 54:31.740]  Yeah, well, I've never done it before.
[54:33.340 --> 54:34.100]  Okay, so
[54:34.100 --> 54:35.320]  he did just learn about it.
[54:35.780 --> 54:37.920]  Yeah, I thought that when it happened
[54:37.920 --> 54:39.900]  and I moved it, I didn't realize
[54:39.900 --> 54:41.880]  it copied. Hey, good job, man.
[54:42.340 --> 54:44.060]  I don't know why Gavin's criticizing you.
[54:44.140 --> 54:45.140]  I'm happy you did it.
[54:45.500 --> 54:48.020]  I think it's one of those things where I'm not...
[54:48.480 --> 54:50.260]  I'm trying to be less on the attack.
[54:50.860 --> 54:51.780]  So I was...
[54:51.780 --> 54:54.020]  I thought that he was attacking me in some way
[54:54.020 --> 54:55.100]  and I didn't understand how.
[54:55.660 --> 54:57.860]  I think I was a little bit. Yeah, he definitely was
[54:57.860 --> 54:59.400]  attacking you. Oh, he was? Okay.
[54:59.400 --> 55:01.180]  I didn't pick it up. No, no, I'm just saying that
[55:01.180 --> 55:03.340]  it's like you learned it. How do I transfer my
[55:03.340 --> 55:04.740]  crackers from the pantry?
[55:05.460 --> 55:06.800]  Like, I don't get the comparable.
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.420]  Because it's not like I clone the crackers
[55:09.420 --> 55:11.500]  and then throw away the crackers. It's honestly
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.020]  the most direct comparison.
[55:13.260 --> 55:15.380]  It would be like if you had a fridge and a
[55:15.380 --> 55:17.560]  freezer and then a deep freezer in your garage.
[55:17.960 --> 55:19.320]  And you would like, some stuff belongs
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.580]  in the freezer, but if the freezer's getting too full,
[55:21.740 --> 55:23.160]  I gotta move it to the deep freezer
[55:23.160 --> 55:24.260]  where I rarely go to.
[55:25.200 --> 55:27.400]  But I think what Andrew's saying is that he doesn't
[55:27.400 --> 55:29.020]  he doesn't make a
[55:29.020 --> 55:31.120]  one-to-one copy of the frozen waffles.
[55:31.140 --> 55:33.000]  Yeah, that's what confused me.
[55:34.180 --> 55:35.460]  That's the function of the external
[55:35.460 --> 55:37.380]  drive is copying to
[55:37.380 --> 55:38.780]  then get rid of the base.
[55:39.740 --> 55:41.480]  I'm not pulling my bread out
[55:41.480 --> 55:43.320]  of the pantry and then
[55:43.320 --> 55:45.180]  cloning it and then throwing the bread away.
[55:46.680 --> 55:47.460]  That's what I was
[55:47.460 --> 55:49.520]  very baffled by when you were making the comparison.
[55:49.960 --> 55:51.400]  And I thought maybe you were like trying to take a
[55:51.400 --> 55:53.420]  dig at me for not putting stuff away, but this is nothing
[55:53.420 --> 55:55.460]  to put stuff away. Nah. I generally
[55:55.460 --> 55:57.480]  put stuff away. What was that on the keyboard?
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.640]  A knife? Yeah, I
[55:59.640 --> 56:01.660]  had to clear my
[56:02.220 --> 56:03.420]  I had to clear stuff
[56:03.420 --> 56:05.480]  off of it. I had a plate on top of it
[56:05.480 --> 56:07.360]  and the
[56:07.360 --> 56:09.700]  knife magnetized
[56:09.700 --> 56:11.480]  to that corner of the laptop
[56:12.460 --> 56:13.580]  and I just
[56:13.580 --> 56:15.480]  thought it was funny. Wait, what happened?
[56:15.740 --> 56:17.540]  It magnetized to the
[56:17.540 --> 56:19.020]  laptop? It's a magnet.
[56:19.280 --> 56:21.180]  It locked on. It's a magnet.
[56:21.520 --> 56:23.440]  Oh, that's good. That's what you want, right, Gavin?
[56:23.440 --> 56:25.400]  You want a lot of magnets like kind of like
[56:25.400 --> 56:27.560]  around your hard drives and your laptops and your screens?
[56:28.360 --> 56:29.420]  When it's writing data
[56:29.420 --> 56:31.480]  suddenly you've got like a missing file and the rest
[56:31.480 --> 56:33.680]  of it's in the knife. Well, the magnet is built in
[56:33.680 --> 56:35.500]  so clearly it's supposed to be there.
[56:36.260 --> 56:37.580]  I didn't put the magnet
[56:37.580 --> 56:39.020]  in the laptop. No.
[56:40.260 --> 56:41.500]  Did you know if when
[56:41.500 --> 56:42.340]  you're transferring
[56:43.320 --> 56:45.500]  files, if you put a magnet the
[56:45.500 --> 56:47.560]  right way next to the one that's
[56:47.560 --> 56:49.680]  pushing the files to the other, you can actually push them faster.
[56:50.360 --> 56:51.380]  That's how you delete
[56:51.380 --> 56:52.880]  files, right? It corrupts it.
[56:53.580 --> 56:55.320]  I've seen spy films where they like
[56:55.320 --> 56:56.860]  rub a bunch of magnets on the thing.
[56:57.280 --> 56:59.480]  I don't think so. That's definitely a thing.
[56:59.540 --> 57:00.820]  You corrupt the computer with the magnet.
[57:01.380 --> 57:03.440]  I think you just push or pull data faster or slower.
[57:04.580 --> 57:05.440]  So you got like an
[57:05.440 --> 57:06.100]  iron knife?
[57:07.400 --> 57:09.340]  Yeah, I guess. I don't know
[57:09.340 --> 57:10.880]  what it's fucking made of. It's a knife.
[57:14.340 --> 57:17.240]  I don't know what you're fucking made of.
[57:17.640 --> 57:19.340]  Gavin, what are your knives
[57:19.340 --> 57:21.120]  made of? Are you concerned about
[57:21.120 --> 57:23.320]  the material of your cutlery?
[57:23.940 --> 57:25.240]  I just don't think mine are magnetic.
[57:26.080 --> 57:26.860]  They could be.
[57:27.120 --> 57:28.720]  Mail me one. I'll try it.
[57:30.560 --> 57:31.040]  Send me
[57:31.480 --> 57:33.540]  a spoon and I'll see if it
[57:33.540 --> 57:34.200]  attaches.
[57:36.480 --> 57:37.480]  I'd say send me a knife
[57:37.480 --> 57:39.320]  but I don't need one. I don't have a spoon.
[57:39.380 --> 57:41.300]  It's already there. Yeah, I'm ready.
[57:42.340 --> 57:43.260]  I don't know why it's
[57:43.260 --> 57:45.120]  magnetized in that part. Is that for like the lid?
[57:46.220 --> 57:47.240]  Something with the lid maybe?
[57:47.920 --> 57:49.480]  Why would it be magnetized
[57:49.480 --> 57:51.400]  in the bottom right corner?
[57:51.820 --> 57:53.300]  Is there a hard drive in it or is it SSD?
[58:00.640 --> 58:02.660]  You think I know?
[58:03.240 --> 58:04.940]  You think I got that information for you?
[58:04.960 --> 58:07.340]  Sometimes when you open a file, does it show
[58:07.340 --> 58:09.240]  you the hourglass and go like...
[58:10.960 --> 58:12.240]  A bar moves?
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.320]  So I know SSD is
[58:15.320 --> 58:18.060]  solid state drive. So I got that going for me.
[58:18.240 --> 58:18.360]  Yeah.
[58:19.160 --> 58:21.280]  How do I tell? Okay, so I click the
[58:21.280 --> 58:23.520]  home. Sorry, technical difficulties
[58:23.520 --> 58:25.500]  with me again. Which we still haven't
[58:25.500 --> 58:27.160]  been able to make because you've had to...
[58:27.160 --> 58:29.080]  I ordered the wrong electrical cable.
[58:29.680 --> 58:31.380]  What does that mean, electrical cable?
[58:31.460 --> 58:32.100]  Like power cable?
[58:33.240 --> 58:35.280]  I thought this computer had a
[58:35.280 --> 58:37.200]  lightning port and I bought a lightning port
[58:37.200 --> 58:39.400]  to HDMI converter but it's a thunderbolt
[58:39.400 --> 58:41.360]  port so I had to get a different
[58:41.360 --> 58:42.140]  converter.
[58:43.260 --> 58:44.660]  Which I now have.
[58:45.300 --> 58:45.360]  Okay.
[58:45.720 --> 58:50.620]  So I click this PC
[58:50.620 --> 58:52.480]  and I have OSC
[58:52.480 --> 58:54.440]  and my passport D.
[58:56.320 --> 58:58.220]  You got that Gavin?
[58:59.080 --> 59:00.140]  My passport
[59:00.860 --> 59:02.600]  D is your external drive
[59:02.600 --> 59:04.500]  as well as WB
[59:04.700 --> 59:05.620]  my passports.
[59:06.120 --> 59:06.860]  So less than digital.
[59:07.280 --> 59:10.280]  So OSC is your hard drive.
[59:10.280 --> 59:12.320]  Gavin's been giving me a lot of crap about this.
[59:12.460 --> 59:14.200]  I sent him a computer issue I had today
[59:14.200 --> 59:15.600]  and he never replied.
[59:16.420 --> 59:17.480]  Didn't help me at all. Oh god, you did.
[59:17.720 --> 59:19.400]  That was the first thing I saw this morning.
[59:19.660 --> 59:22.040]  Some sort of kernel panic report
[59:22.040 --> 59:24.240]  of some sort. So you didn't
[59:24.240 --> 59:25.960]  help him for as long as you
[59:25.960 --> 59:27.100]  humanly could today.
[59:28.620 --> 59:29.100]  Yeah.
[59:32.060 --> 59:33.920]  I got a panic CPU
[59:33.920 --> 59:35.420]  one-caller OXF
[59:37.120 --> 59:38.600]  user space watchdog
[59:38.600 --> 59:40.700]  No timeout, no successful check-ins.
[59:40.920 --> 59:42.160]  I love the idea of I want to
[59:42.160 --> 59:44.820]  not help you longer so I'm going to wake up early.
[59:48.380 --> 59:50.620]  The only way to not help him anymore
[59:50.620 --> 59:51.920]  would be to set your alarm.
[59:52.900 --> 59:54.800]  What is the capacity of your
[59:54.800 --> 59:55.420]  C drive?
[59:57.120 --> 59:58.360]  I'm going to go dump this
[59:58.360 --> 59:59.100]  Gerpler out.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.240]  This is great. I love
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.020]  this show so much.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.380]  It's not even like you're
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.700]  being critical
[01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.100]  or whatever. You're just asking a couple
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:15.840]  of questions
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.320]  and the house of cards starts to crumble.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:20.980]  Oh yeah, I'm not here trying to
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:21.400]  stump him.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.120]  But it sounds like he's going to be needing the question mark
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.940]  key a lot.
[01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:30.700]  Oh, what?
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:37.440]  What did I miss?
[01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:43.760]  I was just saying, I'm not trying to mess with you. I'm just trying to
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.780]  learn a little bit about your computer.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.900]  I can't believe you asked me what material my knife
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:50.640]  is made out of.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.000]  Well, that was like I'm a knife guy.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:58.340]  Oh, it's titanium steel.
[01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.280]  What are you saying?
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.080]  I'm not pancakes with it, man. I don't know what to tell you.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.280]  This is great.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.460]  It made me look up the Ukrainian Jackrabbit again
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.600]  because I felt like Gavin was in Ukrainian Jackrabbit
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.140]  mode where he was going after Andrew.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.440]  That's just a taste of what you
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.980]  can expect in our upcoming
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.080]  technical difficulty supplemental
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.440]  starring Andrew Panton and his computers.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.520]  Are you serious, Geoff? You can expect
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.680]  that on the 22nd when we launch
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.580]  the Gerpler at noon central and you
[01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.840]  guys are playing Mario Party again.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.820]  The return of Dilkong.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.440]  You think Andrew wants to do that?
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.300]  I can't wait. This is exciting.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.760]  By the way, speaking of that, are you aware
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.100]  Eric, that you made us record
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:44.540]  not a time travel announcement, but
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.500]  a regular present day announcement on
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.460]  the same episode where we made that
[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.480]  announcement? Yes.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.480]  It's in the episode.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:53.360]  Yes.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:54.880]  Why'd you do that?
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:57.120]  Because we need to announce it more than once.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.100]  More than once in the same file?
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:01:59.720]  Yes.
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.180]  Wouldn't you want to put it somewhere
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.220]  where they're not already going to hear it in 40 minutes?
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.380]  There's a reason
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:09.100]  I've talked about it twice in
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.400]  this episode. Yeah, you gotta take a look
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.540]  at our retention, buddy. You think they're making it 40 minutes in?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.400]  You're out of your mind.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.480]  There are
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:18.820]  people who googled
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.400]  can I change my
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.240]  vote the day after the election?
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.900]  I'm not taking any chances.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.140]  You gotta just say it more than once.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:27.700]  That's it.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:31.320]  I and I steal or some shit
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.340]  like I'm fucking going to a knife store
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.540]  and say, hey, do you have copper knives?
[01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.380]  Fucking crazy.
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.660]  We're going to end sync so we can wrap this?
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.500]  Are you done with it?
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.500]  Yeah, let's wrap this up.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.200]  Let's go to the next one.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:52.320]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.660]  Do you think this episode 28 was as good
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.080]  as our previous episode 28?
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.240]  Do you think we
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.580]  met our own bar?
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.580]  I think I got a fever
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.580]  in the middle of this episode.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.620]  I don't think you can compare them
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.080]  in that way. I think they're different.
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.640]  It's different us's at different times
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.440]  in our lives. That's you saying
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:14.720]  you think the first one's better. Got it.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.260]  Thank you for listening to another episode
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.240]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.220]  We're glad you stuck
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.840]  with it all the way through.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.160]  I assume you did because you're hearing me
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:27.320]  say this right now. If you're not hearing me say this right now,
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.420]  did I even say it? We'll see you next week.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.280]  What are knives made of?
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.720]  I'm freezing.
