[00:00.000 --> 00:04.160]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.540 --> 00:06.740]  This is number 30. My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:06.800 --> 00:10.580]  With me, as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz,
[00:10.680 --> 00:13.200]  and Eric Baudour in that order.
[00:13.500 --> 00:13.720]  Hello.
[00:14.580 --> 00:19.040]  Would you rather have you be given $50,000, right?
[00:19.560 --> 00:22.540]  Or you just have to click a mouse
[00:23.200 --> 00:25.900]  and however many times you click, you get that many dollars.
[00:26.180 --> 00:26.540]  Click a mouse.
[00:27.070 --> 00:30.680]  If you if you leave more than a second between clicks, it ends.
[00:31.260 --> 00:31.840]  Click a mouse.
[00:32.780 --> 00:35.500]  I'll take the 50 grand now that I think about it.
[00:36.320 --> 00:39.980]  Andrew thinks he can click continuously 50,000 times
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.060]  without a second in between.
[00:42.740 --> 00:45.600]  Easily. Oh, wow. Easily. Easily. Yeah.
[00:46.260 --> 00:47.640]  But then at least it could just keep going.
[00:47.800 --> 00:50.200]  I'll do a stopwatch and a clicker.
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.420]  There has to be a thing that counts your clicks.
[00:52.620 --> 00:54.060]  Sounds good. Let's do it right now.
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.560]  No, I'm not doing it right now.
[00:55.560 --> 00:56.940]  Yep. No, you're doing it right now.
[00:57.000 --> 01:00.700]  Hang on. Do you think you could do it as fast as you could write down
[01:00.700 --> 01:02.100]  20,000 things?
[01:02.820 --> 01:05.780]  What do you mean? No, that's because you have number confidence.
[01:06.020 --> 01:07.580]  You have five digit number confidence.
[01:07.920 --> 01:09.360]  I do. Yeah, that's a great.
[01:09.480 --> 01:13.420]  I think a finger gets tired after 10,000 clicks.
[01:13.740 --> 01:17.360]  I'm imagining clicking a thousand times, just clicking only.
[01:17.880 --> 01:19.640]  And I'm sure I'm going to get pretty tired around a thousand.
[01:20.060 --> 01:21.460]  Yep. All right. Are you ready, Andrew?
[01:21.560 --> 01:23.340]  We're going to see how long it takes in.
[01:23.340 --> 01:25.860]  What do we want to say, a minute or 30 seconds?
[01:25.940 --> 01:27.180]  How many times do we want to have them click?
[01:27.500 --> 01:29.000]  Is there a website that counts clicks?
[01:29.320 --> 01:31.720]  I've just put it into the chat.
[01:32.540 --> 01:34.460]  Let's do 60 seconds.
[01:34.760 --> 01:36.400]  60 seconds it is.
[01:39.160 --> 01:41.900]  OK, let me get this here.
[01:42.880 --> 01:45.680]  Set this up here. 60 seconds on the clock.
[01:45.780 --> 01:46.840]  Andrew, let me know when you're ready.
[01:47.160 --> 01:50.240]  OK, one sec. Let me open it up. OK.
[01:50.880 --> 01:52.020]  OK, ready? Yep.
[01:52.020 --> 01:55.680]  Do you guys want me to share the time screen or does it doesn't matter to you?
[01:55.780 --> 01:57.320]  I think Andrew should share his screen.
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can't.
[01:59.580 --> 02:03.080]  I was I was going to say where it's going to we were going to be asking for the world
[02:03.080 --> 02:04.760]  if that was the case. There's just no way.
[02:04.920 --> 02:07.340]  I can. Oh, no, no. Here, here, I can share it.
[02:07.360 --> 02:08.660]  I can share it. It's fine. I'll do it on this.
[02:08.740 --> 02:10.260]  This is not my ideal click.
[02:11.820 --> 02:13.160]  It's not as good a clicker.
[02:13.500 --> 02:16.540]  Just let just making sure we got the uses right in this.
[02:16.820 --> 02:19.180]  No, it's a touchpad and it's not my ideal click.
[02:19.600 --> 02:20.620]  You can plug a mouse in.
[02:21.140 --> 02:22.560]  I'll let me adjust a little bit.
[02:22.980 --> 02:24.720]  Yeah, you know, get get comfortable.
[02:25.220 --> 02:28.140]  We're going to see how many clicks you can get in a minute.
[02:28.720 --> 02:30.420]  All right. Let me know when you're ready.
[02:31.880 --> 02:33.380]  OK, I'll do it. Countdown.
[02:33.900 --> 02:36.040]  OK. Wait, hang on. Hang on.
[02:36.280 --> 02:37.740]  Now, am I doing it on go?
[02:37.820 --> 02:41.100]  You say three, two, one, go. Go. Yeah. OK. OK. OK.
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.200]  I've got questions for you off the way down here, but.
[02:44.900 --> 02:47.340]  OK. Good luck. OK.
[02:48.680 --> 02:51.520]  Three, two, one, go.
[02:52.140 --> 02:53.900]  OK, 60 seconds. I'm clicking nothing's happening.
[02:54.240 --> 02:56.100]  I'm clicking nothing. I'm watching it.
[02:56.380 --> 02:58.940]  So far, did you should have just said, well, click the plus, idiot.
[03:00.980 --> 03:03.300]  There you can't be this dumb.
[03:03.560 --> 03:04.760]  It's a zero dollars.
[03:05.260 --> 03:06.640]  You got zero dollars.
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.880]  Do you see the plus button?
[03:09.380 --> 03:11.980]  Yeah, it says click plus button or space to count.
[03:12.040 --> 03:14.040]  So I was hitting space and it wasn't working on it.
[03:14.240 --> 03:16.300]  Fucking OK. I think it means a spacebar.
[03:17.340 --> 03:18.260]  I was trying to use the spacebar.
[03:19.860 --> 03:22.980]  Now, the whole thing was based on how many times could you click a mouse?
[03:23.180 --> 03:24.720]  Yeah, OK, but it's close.
[03:25.020 --> 03:25.660]  OK, here we go.
[03:25.900 --> 03:27.620]  Bar. Wait, hang on. I'm all right.
[03:27.700 --> 03:30.360]  My time. OK, OK, OK, 30 seconds.
[03:30.400 --> 03:34.220]  Like, what is five, four, five,
[03:38.080 --> 03:41.900]  four, three, two, one, go.
[03:42.660 --> 03:44.060]  Oh, you already made 10 bucks.
[03:44.460 --> 03:46.600]  Oh, there's a giant.
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.880]  There's a giant green button he could be pressing on, and he chose the smallest thing.
[03:51.780 --> 03:53.220]  Oh, he's already made 60 bucks.
[03:53.680 --> 03:54.920]  Yeah. See, yeah.
[03:54.960 --> 03:56.600]  In my head, I was thinking about this scenario and I was like,
[03:56.640 --> 03:58.460]  I could easily click over 50,000 times.
[03:58.740 --> 04:01.640]  And then I started imagining myself doing it.
[04:01.680 --> 04:03.100]  I was like, oh, there's no way I wouldn't get close.
[04:03.540 --> 04:06.220]  You would get so bored with the activity.
[04:06.720 --> 04:10.240]  But I was I feel like if you if there was a dollar sign in front of it,
[04:10.240 --> 04:11.280]  would you be as bored?
[04:11.940 --> 04:13.340]  No, you wouldn't be as bored.
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.880]  But you could almost buy an Xbox at this point.
[04:17.540 --> 04:20.960]  Or he could have $50,000 and buy a lot of Xboxes immediately.
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.620]  Yeah. 20 seconds, Andrew. Keep going.
[04:24.320 --> 04:25.300]  Andrew, how are you feeling, son?
[04:26.220 --> 04:27.780]  Neck is cramping a little bit.
[04:27.920 --> 04:30.160]  Not an ideal position using a click pad.
[04:30.580 --> 04:32.620]  A lot of negative factors to this, but.
[04:33.960 --> 04:40.740]  Seven seconds, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[04:40.740 --> 04:42.140]  Hands off. Wow.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.200]  Exactly 400. So 400. OK.
[04:46.620 --> 04:49.160]  Divided by what? 50,000.
[04:49.700 --> 04:52.820]  Yeah. Would be how many minutes you'd have to do this at that speed?
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.480]  Yeah. Go in full tilt.
[04:55.180 --> 04:57.560]  All right. Well, I guess somebody better do that math.
[04:59.160 --> 05:00.420]  Hundred and twenty five.
[05:00.920 --> 05:02.260]  Hundred twenty five minutes.
[05:02.920 --> 05:04.920]  Yeah. Two hours. A little over two hours.
[05:05.460 --> 05:06.760]  Oh, that's not bad, actually.
[05:06.840 --> 05:07.900]  That's not bad.
[05:07.900 --> 05:11.120]  I was thinking it was going to be more like 10 hours.
[05:11.360 --> 05:14.220]  So about 40 seconds in, he was like, oh, my neck's cramping.
[05:14.220 --> 05:16.180]  Yeah, because it's not an ideal position.
[05:16.400 --> 05:18.500]  If I could optimally do this. No problem.
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.260]  Yeah. If you just take one second off, though, and so it's like you need to be
[05:23.260 --> 05:25.000]  you to be ready to swap fingers.
[05:25.080 --> 05:26.520]  Maybe a second is longer than you think.
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.180]  Yeah. Yeah. One Mississippi.
[05:29.740 --> 05:31.340]  It was a lot longer than I thought.
[05:31.400 --> 05:33.240]  That was way longer than I thought. Slowed it. Whoa.
[05:34.820 --> 05:37.060]  Also, the name of a great J-Trix album, One Mississippi.
[05:37.060 --> 05:41.140]  Oh, so has that changed your mind, Andrew?
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.540]  Are you still going to go? No, I would still absolutely click.
[05:43.820 --> 05:46.500]  OK, interesting. I'm definitely taking the 50,000.
[05:47.200 --> 05:49.260]  I think you hit a wall before the 50.
[05:49.360 --> 05:53.180]  But as soon as you pass the 50, I think it's just everything opens up.
[05:53.660 --> 05:54.500]  It's just exciting.
[05:55.020 --> 05:58.400]  I just I just think about how I can get
[05:58.400 --> 06:03.920]  $50,000 for free or I have to do that amount of work
[06:03.920 --> 06:06.520]  to get $50,000 to then hope to get more.
[06:06.520 --> 06:08.240]  And everything has to go right.
[06:08.360 --> 06:14.000]  It just seems like $50,000 worth in the hand is worth to $50,000 in the bush.
[06:15.120 --> 06:15.800]  That's fair.
[06:17.340 --> 06:20.520]  Yeah, I guess, you know, maybe maybe I'd reconsider.
[06:21.100 --> 06:23.240]  I don't know. I think I could do more.
[06:23.900 --> 06:24.740]  I think I could do it.
[06:25.120 --> 06:27.480]  Well, if anybody out there has $50,000
[06:27.990 --> 06:32.500]  and wants to challenge Andrew to do this, please send us an email.
[06:34.820 --> 06:36.360]  I have a question for Gavin.
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.100]  OK, when you dream, do people talk?
[06:42.060 --> 06:43.560]  Do people talk in my dream?
[06:43.940 --> 06:46.920]  Yeah, because you don't you don't have an inner voice, right?
[06:46.940 --> 06:47.980]  Like we talked about that before.
[06:48.860 --> 06:52.240]  I think I'm curious when you sleep, do you have an inner voice?
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.140]  Such a good question.
[06:55.100 --> 06:57.940]  I mean, I've had conversations, but was any was anyone actually talking?
[06:59.600 --> 07:00.300]  What do you mean?
[07:00.300 --> 07:03.680]  Was I talking or was I just like telepathically communicating?
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.560]  I think people have I think people talk to me in dreams.
[07:07.160 --> 07:08.800]  Interesting. Interesting.
[07:09.120 --> 07:13.440]  I'm not sure I would get all the motivation I need without knowing what they're saying.
[07:14.140 --> 07:18.040]  Can you hear like I know you don't have an internal monologue,
[07:18.160 --> 07:22.100]  but if you just wanted to right now, could you call up and hear my voice
[07:22.100 --> 07:24.000]  or Meg's voice in your head?
[07:24.860 --> 07:26.820]  Like, can you hear Meg speaking to you right now if you try?
[07:27.460 --> 07:30.020]  Yeah. OK, then I would assume
[07:30.020 --> 07:31.400]  you hear voices in your dreams.
[07:31.940 --> 07:32.680]  That's a good point.
[07:33.340 --> 07:36.320]  I was just curious. I was thinking about it. Random thought. Yeah.
[07:36.800 --> 07:40.120]  Yeah. You don't have an inner voice, but like in your dreams,
[07:40.140 --> 07:41.420]  you're a chatty son of a bitch.
[07:42.520 --> 07:43.800]  You get it all out there.
[07:44.420 --> 07:47.080]  Maybe it's just my personality suppressing my subconscious.
[07:47.400 --> 07:50.460]  Maybe maybe I want to be thinking and having a monologue
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.660]  and I'm suppressing it somehow.
[07:52.500 --> 07:54.520]  That's interesting. That is interesting.
[07:55.200 --> 07:58.420]  Speaking of sleep and random thoughts,
[07:58.420 --> 08:02.300]  I actually wrote down I had my first thought of the day
[08:02.300 --> 08:04.200]  and I actually wrote it down today because it was a thought.
[08:04.480 --> 08:08.100]  Oh, and it doesn't make any sense, but it did when I wrote it down.
[08:08.440 --> 08:10.460]  It's one of those ones where I wrote it down and it made perfect sense.
[08:10.540 --> 08:12.380]  And then a couple hours later, I was doing my notes
[08:12.380 --> 08:14.640]  and it took me a while to figure out what I was even talking about.
[08:14.940 --> 08:16.540]  I have one of these when you're when you're finished.
[08:16.620 --> 08:20.780]  OK, the very first thought I had when I woke up this morning was
[08:20.780 --> 08:23.740]  what if when a major league baseball pitcher dies
[08:23.740 --> 08:27.220]  and he goes to the gates of heaven to be let in and he has to talk to St.
[08:27.220 --> 08:31.600]  Peter, the rule is you have to get hit by every pitch
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.740]  you threw at a batter in your career.
[08:33.800 --> 08:34.340]  And St.
[08:34.420 --> 08:37.340]  Peter stands there with a pitching machine and just fucking wails
[08:37.340 --> 08:38.900]  you as many times as you hit batter.
[08:39.020 --> 08:40.280]  So if you're Roger Clemens, you're fucked.
[08:40.840 --> 08:43.100]  You know, if you know Orion, it's a long, you had a long career.
[08:43.300 --> 08:44.360]  You're going to take a lot of hits.
[08:44.480 --> 08:47.560]  But, you know, if you were a relief pitcher, you're probably OK.
[08:48.160 --> 08:50.260]  That's such an interesting thought, like how different that would be
[08:50.260 --> 08:50.940]  for different people.
[08:51.400 --> 08:53.800]  Yeah, I don't know why I had that thought, but I did.
[08:54.540 --> 08:55.000]  What's yours?
[08:55.590 --> 08:56.840]  What was my first thought of the day?
[08:57.380 --> 08:59.100]  Yeah, I woke up and thought,
[09:00.580 --> 09:04.580]  what if I started using Y-O-U apostrophe R-E
[09:04.580 --> 09:07.660]  for you are, but in the wrong place?
[09:09.140 --> 09:10.640]  So what if I...
[09:11.740 --> 09:14.860]  So what if instead of saying, like, there you are, I wrote that?
[09:16.480 --> 09:17.500]  Oh, God.
[09:17.700 --> 09:21.240]  Because I think like that, that is a correct apostrophe use,
[09:21.280 --> 09:22.960]  but it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
[09:26.040 --> 09:27.420]  That was your first thought?
[09:27.700 --> 09:31.100]  You just found the one hole in the English language.
[09:31.720 --> 09:33.080]  That's so fucking funny.
[09:33.080 --> 09:35.880]  I just looked at their your.
[09:36.660 --> 09:38.020]  I just started laughing.
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.240]  I woke up and I typed it to my phone.
[09:40.320 --> 09:43.040]  I was like, that's stupid, that's really dumb.
[09:44.940 --> 09:45.820]  That's awesome.
[09:47.200 --> 09:48.460]  Don't know where it came from.
[09:50.060 --> 09:51.600]  But I'm going to start using that.
[09:51.900 --> 09:52.580]  That's great.
[09:53.800 --> 09:57.980]  Yeah, that that is a menacing, not even you're a menace for using it.
[09:58.040 --> 09:58.880]  That's terrible.
[10:00.380 --> 10:02.460]  There you are. There you are.
[10:03.860 --> 10:06.300]  Did we put on a throat goat video, right?
[10:06.900 --> 10:07.880]  Yes. Yes.
[10:08.240 --> 10:09.960]  I saw a comment on it.
[10:10.080 --> 10:11.360]  I think it was on the Patreon.
[10:11.500 --> 10:13.980]  I should have wrote down who said it because it was really funny, but I didn't.
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.380]  But somebody wrote down, get ready for the throat down.
[10:18.380 --> 10:24.440]  And that made me laugh for like fucking 90 seconds.
[10:24.560 --> 10:25.480]  I shit you not.
[10:25.820 --> 10:30.360]  One of those ones where I was so tickled and also so mad for not thinking of it
[10:30.360 --> 10:32.260]  because we could have put it in the video to advertise it.
[10:32.540 --> 10:33.720]  Get ready for the throat down.
[10:33.800 --> 10:34.900]  Whoever you were is.
[10:34.980 --> 10:37.440]  That's the funniest thing I read in the month of November. Thank you.
[10:38.220 --> 10:40.100]  Get ready for the throat down.
[10:40.960 --> 10:41.700]  It's the throat off.
[10:44.500 --> 10:47.480]  I'm not surprised that I came in last in that thing.
[10:48.020 --> 10:52.160]  It's funny seeing people submit their own and how they measure up.
[10:52.260 --> 10:52.840]  It's been fun.
[10:53.200 --> 10:54.860]  There's some big ass mouths out there.
[10:55.320 --> 10:56.780]  Yeah. Did anyone get to the E?
[10:57.100 --> 10:58.960]  I don't think I've seen any E's.
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.000]  No, but there's been some like mid G's, mid U's even.
[11:02.200 --> 11:04.240]  There's like some pretty insane.
[11:05.000 --> 11:06.700]  Wait, how did they get to a G?
[11:07.060 --> 11:08.060]  Oh, no, sorry.
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.200]  I'm looking, I'm thinking about it upside down.
[11:12.140 --> 11:13.280]  What do you mean?
[11:13.520 --> 11:14.680]  What do you mean upside down?
[11:14.700 --> 11:15.540]  Other way around?
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.600]  R, I was thinking R.
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.620]  R, OK.
[11:17.840 --> 11:19.240]  Hey, Geoff, just want to check on you.
[11:19.260 --> 11:20.120]  Make sure you're OK.
[11:20.440 --> 11:21.280]  Are you OK?
[11:22.780 --> 11:23.460]  I'm OK.
[11:27.020 --> 11:28.960]  I had a had a freak injury.
[11:29.520 --> 11:30.380]  I had a new injury.
[11:30.960 --> 11:31.720]  Is it chair based?
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.900]  It is chair based, yeah.
[11:35.500 --> 11:37.940]  I want to talk to you guys about it as a side.
[11:38.060 --> 11:40.420]  It's it's sort of a it was not fun.
[11:41.640 --> 11:42.440]  I spilled.
[11:43.140 --> 11:45.100]  I had a thing of toothpicks on my desk.
[11:45.100 --> 11:48.720]  And I spilled them and I picked them up and I thought I got them all.
[11:48.760 --> 11:49.360]  But I didn't.
[11:50.100 --> 11:53.260]  One of them got wedged in the little gap between
[11:53.760 --> 11:57.760]  the wheel of my chair and like the plastic on the outside of it.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.240]  And I didn't notice it.
[11:59.700 --> 12:02.980]  And so I went to sit down and it was one of those things
[12:02.980 --> 12:06.040]  or as this does wasn't thinking, sat down, move my foot across.
[12:06.400 --> 12:09.360]  And then I just felt something enter my toe instantly.
[12:10.320 --> 12:12.660]  And there wasn't pain to it's just like that.
[12:12.920 --> 12:13.780]  That's not great.
[12:15.100 --> 12:18.160]  The way the toothpick was lodged in the wheel, it was pointing out
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.480]  like a sharp edge and it went right into one of my toes
[12:22.580 --> 12:25.560]  to the point where like I couldn't just pull it out.
[12:25.580 --> 12:28.100]  I had to have somebody help remove it.
[12:28.240 --> 12:30.420]  And it wasn't painful.
[12:30.620 --> 12:34.160]  Like it was relatively like it was not a bad injury,
[12:34.160 --> 12:36.840]  but it made it annoying to walk the next day.
[12:37.520 --> 12:40.640]  And I thought about like all the times in my life
[12:40.640 --> 12:44.560]  I've fallen off of hills or I've like taken blows, been in car accidents.
[12:45.100 --> 12:47.200]  And have been relatively unaffected.
[12:47.320 --> 12:51.980]  But how annoying it was having this toothpick injury on my toe
[12:51.980 --> 12:52.900]  for like two days.
[12:53.480 --> 12:56.400]  What is like the least cool injury you guys have had?
[12:56.480 --> 12:57.680]  Like that was impactful.
[12:58.320 --> 13:00.260]  Is there ever something where it was like, I don't know,
[13:00.300 --> 13:03.040]  you threw your back out trying to grab something and it just fucked you up
[13:03.040 --> 13:07.200]  as opposed to what on paper you would think would have done way more damage?
[13:07.900 --> 13:11.120]  Emily threw a dog toy at me when we were playing one night
[13:11.120 --> 13:14.080]  and I flinched in such a way that my shoulder locked up
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.780]  and I had to go to physical fucking therapy for six months.
[13:20.000 --> 13:20.940]  That's mine.
[13:21.400 --> 13:22.780]  Oh, that's so good.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.140]  When did this happen?
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.400]  During Fuckface.
[13:25.500 --> 13:27.220]  It was in the middle of our fucking podcast.
[13:27.320 --> 13:28.320]  We probably talked about it.
[13:28.340 --> 13:29.880]  I probably told the story on air.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  I feel like I would have remembered that.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.640]  I still have to do stretches every morning in the shower
[13:36.640 --> 13:38.880]  with my left fucking arm and shoulder.
[13:39.280 --> 13:42.940]  Did that put a cap on your 80 mile per hour pitch?
[13:42.940 --> 13:46.420]  Is that why it was in that?
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.740]  That was in the era where all the injuries started.
[13:48.920 --> 13:50.140]  And I could add.
[13:50.340 --> 13:51.900]  You fucking pinpointed when it happened.
[13:52.060 --> 13:55.100]  It happened right around there when I couldn't get fucking healthy
[13:55.100 --> 13:56.300]  long enough to throw a pitch.
[13:56.440 --> 14:00.120]  I couldn't fucking lift my arm above my nipple for about,
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.200]  I don't know, a month there after that.
[14:02.300 --> 14:04.960]  It was I'm still an immediate.
[14:05.200 --> 14:08.600]  What do you flinch like, you know, instantly idiotic, like locked up.
[14:08.700 --> 14:11.160]  And I like fell over and I went, oh, no.
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.760]  And Emily was laughing at me because I'm fucking 100 years old.
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.020]  And then it was a trip to the physical therapist.
[14:16.160 --> 14:19.160]  And then it was a trip to the physical therapist every week for six months,
[14:19.180 --> 14:19.540]  I think.
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.400]  How about you?
[14:24.740 --> 14:28.260]  I'd love to see a photo of the dog toy just at some point.
[14:28.420 --> 14:29.300]  I think it was.
[14:29.560 --> 14:31.440]  I think it was Puss Puss or Owl Owl.
[14:31.560 --> 14:33.060]  It was. Oh, that's perfect.
[14:33.200 --> 14:35.660]  Oh, wow. Oh, yeah.
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.960]  It was one of them for sure.
[14:37.460 --> 14:38.400]  It's tough to beat.
[14:38.480 --> 14:39.560]  Gavin, do you have one of those?
[14:40.080 --> 14:45.240]  I had a Nerf Maverick when I was 15 or something.
[14:46.020 --> 14:51.100]  A little revolver Nerf gun that shoots little suction tarts and I fired it.
[14:51.180 --> 14:52.080]  And the thing come out.
[14:52.200 --> 14:52.780]  I was like, huh.
[14:53.320 --> 14:55.700]  So I just looked directly down the barrel
[14:57.260 --> 15:00.080]  and pulled the trigger and it suctioned to my eye.
[15:03.260 --> 15:05.040]  It was stuck on the front of my eye.
[15:06.620 --> 15:07.860]  What did you do?
[15:07.900 --> 15:09.980]  Did you pull it off on me, Emily, or did you freak out?
[15:10.180 --> 15:10.880]  I freaked out.
[15:10.880 --> 15:12.480]  I freaked the goddamn out.
[15:12.660 --> 15:14.460]  And I was like trying to close my eye to knock it off.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.680]  And it came off pretty quickly.
[15:15.820 --> 15:19.360]  It was maybe it was stuck there for like two seconds, but it hurt so much.
[15:19.360 --> 15:20.820]  Like it came with such force.
[15:20.880 --> 15:23.960]  And I just didn't understand what I was seeing.
[15:24.400 --> 15:30.580]  OK, well, there was no information, but I was like, oh, oh, oh, how old are you?
[15:31.580 --> 15:34.020]  I was probably like 16, 15, maybe.
[15:34.860 --> 15:36.700]  So much older than I thought you were going to be.
[15:36.700 --> 15:42.020]  Yeah, dude, that reminds me of Bernie and Gus
[15:42.020 --> 15:45.580]  and I had a paintball phase for a little bit there for about I don't know.
[15:45.680 --> 15:47.060]  I had a paintball phase for about four months.
[15:47.140 --> 15:48.200]  I think there's less than about six.
[15:48.540 --> 15:50.240]  I fell out before they did.
[15:50.440 --> 15:53.240]  But we would go and play in the woods behind the call center
[15:53.240 --> 15:53.980]  where we used to work, right?
[15:54.460 --> 15:59.080]  And one day I put on my army boots, my steel toed army boots.
[15:59.380 --> 16:02.720]  And while I was in the woods, like waiting for Bernie or Gus or whatever,
[16:02.720 --> 16:04.420]  I just had my paintball gun in my hand.
[16:04.420 --> 16:05.980]  And I thought, huh.
[16:06.240 --> 16:10.840]  And I just pointed it at my foot, like, I don't know, six inches
[16:10.840 --> 16:15.060]  above my fucking toe, my big toe, and just shot it and found out
[16:15.060 --> 16:17.040]  that I did not have steel toe boots.
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.580]  I just had regular boots and they were like cardboard.
[16:22.140 --> 16:26.100]  And that was one of the most blindingly painful moments of my life.
[16:26.120 --> 16:28.400]  I think I'm so glad you reminded me of all this.
[16:29.060 --> 16:32.500]  It's so annoying when you just do it to yourself and there's like no one to blame.
[16:32.500 --> 16:34.860]  And like nothing really surprising happened.
[16:35.020 --> 16:36.060]  It's just all your fault.
[16:36.620 --> 16:39.720]  Yeah. And you like you have to sit there for a second and think like,
[16:39.800 --> 16:41.460]  how did I do that?
[16:41.580 --> 16:42.960]  And you have to like, what are this?
[16:43.040 --> 16:44.000]  Why did my brain?
[16:44.760 --> 16:45.920]  What was I thinking?
[16:46.260 --> 16:49.960]  You just try to understand your own stupidity and there's just nothing there.
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.940]  And you realize, I'm just I'm just operating on instinct half the time.
[16:55.040 --> 16:57.760]  I'm just a dumb animal.
[16:59.440 --> 17:02.180]  I don't think I've ever felt like more of an oaf
[17:02.180 --> 17:06.040]  than whenever I would play paintball and the handful of times I did it.
[17:06.120 --> 17:08.180]  Just terrible. Just in all forms.
[17:08.800 --> 17:09.960]  Masks steaming up.
[17:10.060 --> 17:12.840]  Can't see every single time I'd play.
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.040]  I would fuck up the ammo at some point and just spill it everywhere.
[17:16.220 --> 17:18.760]  Like I just said, completely incompetent.
[17:19.000 --> 17:20.640]  It's so funny when people are like
[17:21.700 --> 17:24.680]  checking their hopper, see if they got any paintballs left
[17:24.680 --> 17:26.780]  and they get shot in the gun and they all just fly.
[17:27.600 --> 17:31.100]  It's like really funny shit that could happen to people so much.
[17:32.300 --> 17:35.340]  And it's one of those sports where, like, the better you are, the labor it looks.
[17:35.860 --> 17:37.140]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
[17:37.720 --> 17:39.040]  There's no way to look cool in paintball.
[17:39.500 --> 17:41.160]  Yeah. You play much paintball, Gavin?
[17:41.580 --> 17:44.460]  I played probably, I don't know, 10 times.
[17:45.120 --> 17:47.100]  Oh, wow. That's more than I would have guessed.
[17:47.940 --> 17:51.180]  Yeah, it's fun. Like a semi-pro over there. Yeah.
[17:52.280 --> 17:56.000]  I mean, he's not shooting himself in the foot with the backwoods, but
[17:56.780 --> 17:57.640]  it's not his way.
[17:59.440 --> 18:06.500]  Hey, I, I had an idea I wanted to pitch you guys for about a month now.
[18:06.720 --> 18:08.980]  I mentioned it to Andrew the other day and he seemed to like it.
[18:09.180 --> 18:10.940]  I keep I keep missing it.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.640]  I think I think this is the fifth podcast I've tried to bring it up.
[18:14.440 --> 18:17.800]  And I'm just going to shoehorn it in because I really want to try it.
[18:17.860 --> 18:21.100]  And I, I keep forgetting to talk about it.
[18:21.240 --> 18:23.400]  A while back, I started watching this TikTok channel.
[18:23.720 --> 18:25.540]  I'll send it to you guys if you're not familiar with it.
[18:25.540 --> 18:26.400]  This is on YouTube.
[18:26.580 --> 18:30.340]  It's called Shitty Places, and it's just this fucking dude from Texas
[18:30.340 --> 18:32.260]  who wears like a backwards Hurley hat.
[18:32.580 --> 18:35.960]  And he just has Google Maps open and he just does street view.
[18:36.040 --> 18:38.200]  And he goes like, today, we're going to look at Baltimore.
[18:38.800 --> 18:42.040]  Let's see. We're going to drop five pins and we're going to see, is it shitty?
[18:42.240 --> 18:44.400]  And he just drops in a pin and he does a 360 view.
[18:44.400 --> 18:45.560]  And he's like, not shitty.
[18:45.740 --> 18:49.600]  And then he goes to one and he's like, this is shitty.
[18:50.300 --> 18:51.940]  And it's just funny the way he says it's shitty.
[18:51.940 --> 18:54.440]  But there's something so soothing about watching him
[18:54.440 --> 18:57.240]  just drop into the world and spin around.
[18:57.340 --> 19:01.860]  And, you know, I'm really into geolocators and stuff, but they aren't.
[19:02.540 --> 19:05.420]  That's not content for us.
[19:06.160 --> 19:06.960]  Geolocation, I don't think.
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.980]  I think it's a it's not the kind of thing we do.
[19:09.240 --> 19:10.640]  I think we do is a little silly and irreverent.
[19:10.680 --> 19:13.820]  So I was trying to figure out how do you how do you essentially take the spirit
[19:13.820 --> 19:16.200]  of what they're doing and turn it into sloppy Joe's bingo?
[19:16.400 --> 19:19.740]  And I had an idea for Geo Bingo
[19:20.260 --> 19:25.420]  where we come up with a bunch of prompts like a stop sign,
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.320]  somebody pushing a stroller, walking a dog, swimming pool, McDonald's,
[19:31.360 --> 19:33.860]  stop sign in a different language, whatever.
[19:34.220 --> 19:37.480]  And you fill out your bingo cards and then one person drives
[19:37.480 --> 19:40.540]  and just drops into the world and we do a 360 view.
[19:40.740 --> 19:44.220]  And then we just play bingo that way and see who can fill out a card first.
[19:45.360 --> 19:46.180]  I want to play.
[19:46.620 --> 19:47.500]  Yeah, I think it's a lot of fun.
[19:48.120 --> 19:52.140]  How often do you know they change the images for like a Street View thing?
[19:53.180 --> 19:54.440]  Is it frequent or is it rare?
[19:54.620 --> 19:58.040]  I think about once a year, maybe depending on how busy your area is.
[19:58.860 --> 20:02.280]  Because I know I've gone I've gone back through Google Street View
[20:02.280 --> 20:05.660]  and been able to go back like every year to see like houses
[20:05.660 --> 20:08.540]  in my old neighborhood change back to 2010, I think I could go.
[20:09.180 --> 20:13.800]  It could be a lot of fun to if one of us wanted to like block off
[20:14.360 --> 20:17.240]  like, I don't know, a few blocks of a place and then
[20:17.720 --> 20:20.960]  scavenger hunt that, you know, like is findable type thing.
[20:21.160 --> 20:22.620]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[20:22.860 --> 20:24.820]  So you would like pre-scout to come up with the prompt.
[20:24.960 --> 20:27.700]  Yeah, you would get like you would pre-scout and you would tell everybody
[20:27.700 --> 20:31.320]  like, hey, it's a six block or whatever radius of this place.
[20:31.680 --> 20:34.320]  And so, you know, it's findable.
[20:34.600 --> 20:37.840]  And it's just trying to figure out where and then doing like a race that way.
[20:38.700 --> 20:39.980]  Like a scavenger hunt type race.
[20:40.060 --> 20:40.740]  Yeah, all that stuff.
[20:40.880 --> 20:42.780]  I think that would be a lot of fun with Falcons
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.800]  because they would be able to play also.
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.360]  Yeah, we would be able to drop that for people
[20:47.360 --> 20:49.300]  and they can try to find it at the same time we do.
[20:49.440 --> 20:52.680]  I think a scavenger hunt of like a six block radius would be a lot of fun.
[20:53.020 --> 20:54.140]  That's a really cool idea. Yeah.
[20:55.080 --> 20:57.160]  Anyway, I think there's something here in all of this,
[20:57.160 --> 21:00.960]  but I'd love to try to get together and do a geo scavenger hunt or a geo bingo.
[21:01.640 --> 21:03.220]  You know, we could do it location specific.
[21:03.320 --> 21:05.880]  We could do it just in Austin or Nanaimo or we could do it
[21:05.880 --> 21:08.580]  in fucking Deputy, Indiana if we wanted to, you know.
[21:10.240 --> 21:12.360]  And so there could be themed episodes.
[21:12.360 --> 21:15.120]  And I don't know, it might be something that if it's if it's fun,
[21:15.240 --> 21:18.980]  I don't think it's as fun as like a sloppy jazz bingo, but I think it's worth trying.
[21:19.260 --> 21:19.980]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:20.620 --> 21:21.640]  I think it could be a lot of fun.
[21:22.460 --> 21:23.980]  It's a great idea. Thanks, man.
[21:24.840 --> 21:26.020]  I'll put it on the list. I definitely have to try it.
[21:27.760 --> 21:31.840]  You know, when I first started making online content back in the Stone Ages,
[21:32.480 --> 21:37.140]  e-commerce and online selling was a dream.
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.180]  It was something reserved for the biggest, snootiest, richest of the rich
[21:41.180 --> 21:44.020]  corporation, not the let the little guy like me.
[21:44.440 --> 21:47.160]  Yet here we are, 20 plus years later,
[21:47.600 --> 21:50.080]  and it has become the backbone of my career.
[21:50.560 --> 21:53.000]  And that backbone runs on Shopify.
[21:53.620 --> 21:56.920]  We just launched our first Gerpler,
[21:57.380 --> 22:03.200]  sold 4000 in four minutes through a Shopify store that didn't skip a beat.
[22:03.280 --> 22:06.200]  It's because it is the global commerce platform
[22:06.200 --> 22:08.820]  that helps you sell at every stage of your business.
[22:08.820 --> 22:11.600]  So whether you're selling scented soap or really,
[22:11.940 --> 22:16.440]  really cool and perfect to drink out of cups or offering outdoor outfits,
[22:16.880 --> 22:21.040]  Shopify helps you sell everywhere from their all-in-one e-commerce
[22:21.040 --> 22:23.580]  platform to their in-person POS system.
[22:23.960 --> 22:27.820]  Wherever and whatever you are selling, Shopify has got you covered.
[22:28.080 --> 22:29.100]  They've got us covered.
[22:29.400 --> 22:32.940]  You can get covered in clothes that you buy from our Shopify store.
[22:33.480 --> 22:36.440]  Shopify powers 10 percent of all e-commerce in the U.S.
[22:36.440 --> 22:41.960]  And Shopify is the global force behind Allbirds, Rothy's and Brooklyn.
[22:42.080 --> 22:47.020]  And not to mention the regulation store and a million other entrepreneurs out
[22:47.020 --> 22:49.080]  there, whether they're as big as regulation
[22:49.080 --> 22:52.340]  or maybe they're just hoping to be someday like Brooklyn.
[22:52.460 --> 22:55.460]  And they're looking up at us and they're saying someday Brooklyn
[22:55.460 --> 22:57.220]  and can be a regulation company.
[22:57.220 --> 23:00.240]  And with Shopify's help, maybe they'll get there.

[24:34.060 --> 24:38.980]  I have a I have a really stupid problem, a dilemma that I need help.
[24:39.480 --> 24:41.840]  OK, I don't know the answer to this.
[24:42.100 --> 24:42.780]  Well, I kind of do.
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.200]  Do people just eat cranberries like normal cranberries?
[24:47.600 --> 24:49.620]  Not like obviously their sauce.
[24:50.340 --> 24:51.520]  Do people just eat the berry?
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.620]  I don't typically. No, not really.
[24:55.460 --> 24:57.220]  Because I so there's.
[24:58.160 --> 25:02.640]  I enjoy whatever, like, I love a new lemonade
[25:02.640 --> 25:07.360]  and Starbucks has a new lemonade for the fall season, and I got it.
[25:07.860 --> 25:11.800]  And I have a friend who we're talking about drinking like fruit type drinks
[25:11.800 --> 25:13.260]  and they never have the fruit.
[25:13.320 --> 25:14.720]  They never eat the fruit that's in it.
[25:14.740 --> 25:15.700]  And I thought that was weird.
[25:16.180 --> 25:17.140]  So you have to eat the fruit.
[25:17.840 --> 25:20.860]  But I've been ordering these and they have cranberry in them.
[25:20.860 --> 25:22.980]  And it's just a bunch of sliced cranberry.
[25:23.600 --> 25:26.600]  And I've been eating it because that's do you eat the fruit
[25:26.600 --> 25:27.440]  when you're not the drink?
[25:27.680 --> 25:30.760]  But it is a really unpleasant experience to the point where I just
[25:31.380 --> 25:33.060]  I don't know, do people eat these?
[25:33.340 --> 25:35.620]  Made me realize I've never seen anyone just eat cranberry.
[25:36.020 --> 25:38.080]  Cranberries are pretty, pretty tart fruit.
[25:38.100 --> 25:39.820]  Yeah, they're hot on the super tart.
[25:39.940 --> 25:42.860]  Yeah, I think they're like they're like really like like a stringent,
[25:43.100 --> 25:46.120]  really like they make you go like that.
[25:46.220 --> 25:47.160]  They do. Yes.
[25:47.600 --> 25:50.560]  That's why you cut everything that's got cranberry in it
[25:50.560 --> 25:52.960]  is like fucking heavily doused in sugar.
[25:53.220 --> 25:57.900]  Well, when you've when you have like a water with lemon, do you eat the lemon?
[25:58.140 --> 25:59.100]  I do sometimes.
[26:00.040 --> 26:02.040]  Yeah, no, typically not. That's a good point.
[26:02.620 --> 26:04.320]  I'll squeeze it into the drink.
[26:04.780 --> 26:08.740]  But you never like fish the lime out of a Corona and tuck in.
[26:09.540 --> 26:12.720]  No, I guess in my mind, though, because I'm squeezing it like I'm already
[26:13.230 --> 26:15.780]  I'm like eating it with my hands. Yeah.
[26:16.560 --> 26:20.320]  Like it wouldn't even cross my mind to try to eat a squeezed lemon.
[26:20.560 --> 26:22.620]  Because I've already I've gotten all the juice out.
[26:23.780 --> 26:27.420]  I just was curious if I've been eating this drink wrong, I guess,
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.040]  because like typically it'll be strawberries or dragonfruit or pineapple,
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.040]  all very edible fruits that I enjoy eating.
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.380]  But I've been having these cranberry drinks and there will be a giant thing
[26:39.380 --> 26:42.400]  of cranberries at the bottom that I've been eating and going.
[26:42.500 --> 26:43.620]  This is really unpleasant.
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.080]  Do I just not like cranberries or are these not for just.
[26:47.500 --> 26:49.980]  Why don't you just eat one and then be like, I don't like cranberries.
[26:49.980 --> 26:51.740]  Eating this drink wrong.
[26:51.900 --> 26:55.580]  And you keep going back to it, going, guys, I got to be fucking this up.
[26:55.640 --> 26:57.260]  This has to be on me. Sort of.
[26:57.400 --> 26:59.320]  Well, it's like a thing where I don't know.
[26:59.600 --> 27:02.340]  It's not like I can eat it and I don't.
[27:02.500 --> 27:03.300]  It's not the worst.
[27:03.740 --> 27:05.580]  I enjoy, I guess, having fruit.
[27:05.680 --> 27:06.800]  It can be refreshing.
[27:07.560 --> 27:08.840]  But but you don't enjoy it.
[27:09.700 --> 27:11.140]  Yeah, I don't really, I guess.
[27:11.560 --> 27:13.740]  Andrew, yes, Andrew.
[27:14.800 --> 27:18.600]  It's a cranberry orange refresher, right?
[27:18.600 --> 27:21.320]  Yeah. So are there oranges in it as well?
[27:21.760 --> 27:22.580]  I don't think so.
[27:22.660 --> 27:25.620]  I think Starbucks just lies about whatever the second thing is.
[27:25.680 --> 27:27.280]  And they got in trouble for it.
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.500]  Like, I think they did like a dragon fruit something.
[27:33.340 --> 27:34.480]  Mango dragon fruit.
[27:34.600 --> 27:35.760]  There was no mango in it.
[27:35.800 --> 27:38.420]  Like, I just I think they just lie about what that.
[27:39.200 --> 27:39.820]  Second is.
[27:40.160 --> 27:41.900]  I don't think anybody eats raw cranberries.
[27:42.880 --> 27:46.840]  So I should stop eating the cranberries in the cranberry orange refresher.
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.620]  If you don't like them, then yes, it's not.
[27:50.720 --> 27:52.980]  It's just it was like, do people do this?
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.280]  I guess, you know, or my.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.000]  Honestly, Andrew, I think you got to try it one more time.
[27:59.460 --> 28:02.280]  Did the next cranberries might be really good cranberries.
[28:02.720 --> 28:06.180]  The problem was the first time I ordered it, I ordered extra cranberries.
[28:06.300 --> 28:09.680]  I doubled the cranberry amount because I was like, let's get some real flavor in this.
[28:09.940 --> 28:10.680]  Wait, you.
[28:14.360 --> 28:16.720]  Do you what the fuck?
[28:17.340 --> 28:18.540]  What the fuck?
[28:18.880 --> 28:21.440]  I'm surprised. Are you talking about doubled it?
[28:21.500 --> 28:23.960]  And I was like, that was way too many cranberries.
[28:24.080 --> 28:27.480]  And then I ordered it again with just the base amount.
[28:27.600 --> 28:30.900]  And it was still a lot of cranberries that I end up with at the bottom.
[28:31.200 --> 28:32.500]  And I just eat.
[28:33.720 --> 28:35.780]  And it just never occurred to me.
[28:35.900 --> 28:37.580]  I was just curious, do people eat these?
[28:37.580 --> 28:41.140]  But based on what you say, you didn't particularly enjoy the normal amount.
[28:41.400 --> 28:43.240]  So why would you double them?
[28:43.480 --> 28:45.460]  Well, sometimes you can have too much of a thing.
[28:46.860 --> 28:49.720]  So the first time I ordered it, it was two extra.
[28:51.420 --> 28:53.740]  So you decided to back off on it a little bit.
[28:53.880 --> 28:57.200]  Yes. And then I had the one X and it was still a lot of cranberries.
[28:57.920 --> 29:00.700]  And then it just made me rethink, like, am I not?
[29:00.860 --> 29:03.500]  Is it is this the only one you're not supposed to eat the fruit
[29:03.500 --> 29:05.440]  where you're not supposed to eat the fruit on the other ones?
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.660]  And I've been doing it anyway.
[29:07.360 --> 29:09.140]  What are the protocols to this?
[29:10.060 --> 29:11.640]  But I think if it's in there, it's edible.
[29:12.300 --> 29:14.660]  Yeah, technically, that's true.
[29:15.140 --> 29:17.800]  They couldn't really put like non food in it.
[29:18.020 --> 29:18.840]  That's very true.
[29:18.920 --> 29:22.960]  I just am more of I'm somebody who across the making of the show
[29:22.960 --> 29:26.140]  have realized that my instincts for these things are not necessarily
[29:26.940 --> 29:29.340]  the same as other people's eyes.
[29:29.500 --> 29:33.520]  So if you had so when you ordered twice as many cranberries,
[29:33.760 --> 29:35.200]  have you had that drink before?
[29:35.640 --> 29:38.380]  No. OK, so you're insane.
[29:38.800 --> 29:41.940]  I just really wanted a lot of cranberry and I was like, why?
[29:43.040 --> 29:45.220]  Because I like cranberry mixes.
[29:45.660 --> 29:47.760]  And so I thought extra flavor, I guess.
[29:47.860 --> 29:49.840]  I don't know. Geoff, do something.
[29:50.640 --> 29:52.920]  I also don't know if they're roasted or not.
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.540]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[29:55.120 --> 29:56.560]  Here's what I'm going to do, Andrew. Roasted?
[29:56.960 --> 30:01.900]  Can you how do you cook a cranberry and not melt it into cranberry sauce?
[30:01.940 --> 30:04.140]  Because I know I make cranberry sauce. I know how that works.
[30:04.140 --> 30:05.220]  Like a boiled one?
[30:05.740 --> 30:07.500]  Yeah. Like is it like that?
[30:07.900 --> 30:11.040]  I don't know if they've done something to the cranberry or if it's just a raw
[30:11.040 --> 30:15.320]  cranberry. This is my this is so crazy.
[30:15.740 --> 30:17.940]  Twice as many cranberries, please.
[30:18.340 --> 30:21.360]  Do you think they do something to the blueberry or the strawberry
[30:21.360 --> 30:22.840]  before they throw it in a drink?
[30:24.440 --> 30:26.560]  They are, I think, frozen.
[30:27.060 --> 30:28.280]  Yeah. They give a quick roast.
[30:28.900 --> 30:31.840]  Yeah. Put them on the old barbecue.
[30:33.600 --> 30:35.180]  Cranberries roasting on an oven.
[30:35.180 --> 30:37.120]  Here's what I'm going to do, Andrew.
[30:37.400 --> 30:38.400]  Here's what I'm going to do, Eric.
[30:39.140 --> 30:41.420]  I'm going to go to Starbucks and I'm going to get one of these fucking things
[30:41.420 --> 30:42.540]  because it looks delicious.
[30:42.900 --> 30:43.720]  And it's so good.
[30:43.820 --> 30:45.880]  Then I'm going to eat the cranberry and I'll determine
[30:45.880 --> 30:47.680]  if you're supposed to eat it or not.
[30:47.860 --> 30:52.160]  As a fruit fan, I'll be able to make a professional determination
[30:52.160 --> 30:53.020]  one way or the other.
[30:53.800 --> 30:55.360]  You should order one now for delivery.
[30:55.960 --> 30:56.880]  Oh, let me see if I can do that.
[30:57.900 --> 31:00.140]  It won't get here before the podcast, but let me see.
[31:00.650 --> 31:02.680]  Uh, Uber.
[31:03.780 --> 31:05.200]  On a triple cranberry.
[31:05.960 --> 31:06.420]  Eat.
[31:07.100 --> 31:08.660]  I've never had it before.
[31:08.880 --> 31:09.820]  Double the cranberries.
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.720]  Now. That's why I'm going to double for the...
[31:13.290 --> 31:14.140]  Off the bat.
[31:14.620 --> 31:15.160]  Starbucks.
[31:15.800 --> 31:18.220]  That is, that is the craziest, Andrew.
[31:18.420 --> 31:19.260]  That is the craziest.
[31:19.260 --> 31:21.000]  Am I trying something?
[31:21.260 --> 31:22.540]  I wouldn't modify it yet.
[31:22.660 --> 31:26.080]  No, you have to try the base, like double the...
[31:26.080 --> 31:27.580]  Also, they're cranberries.
[31:27.760 --> 31:29.800]  The thing that you can't eat.
[31:29.800 --> 31:30.940]  I don't know, man.
[31:31.120 --> 31:31.640]  I don't know.
[31:31.940 --> 31:32.600]  Well, that's the thing.
[31:32.680 --> 31:34.920]  I've never had a cranberry outside of the sauce.
[31:35.000 --> 31:38.820]  So I thought if it's in the drink, then it must be eatable
[31:38.820 --> 31:43.020]  the same way that I'd never had a dragon fruit before getting their drink.
[31:43.320 --> 31:47.220]  Now, this is the cranberry orange refresher.
[31:47.440 --> 31:48.680]  Yeah, the lemonade refresher.
[31:48.900 --> 31:49.420]  A different one.
[31:49.560 --> 31:53.640]  No, lemonade refresher, because there's there's cranberry orange refresher
[31:53.640 --> 31:55.700]  or cranberry orange lemonade.
[31:55.980 --> 31:57.200]  Do you want cranberry orange lemonade?
[31:57.240 --> 31:58.340]  I do the lemonade.
[31:58.340 --> 31:59.360]  Yeah, refresher.
[31:59.520 --> 32:01.000]  OK, cranberry orange lemonade.
[32:01.100 --> 32:04.160]  In my defense, it looks like, OK,
[32:04.820 --> 32:07.660]  I paid 95 cents for additional cranberry fruit.
[32:07.760 --> 32:08.760]  That is a wild move.
[32:08.900 --> 32:09.860]  You're crazy.
[32:10.180 --> 32:10.660]  Wow.
[32:11.520 --> 32:12.440]  That was a bad decision.
[32:13.000 --> 32:14.600]  I'm going to up the cranberry fruit.
[32:14.820 --> 32:18.400]  OK, wait, Geoff, it's an extra dollar.
[32:18.660 --> 32:19.160]  All right.
[32:20.140 --> 32:23.860]  Do you think anyone anywhere has ever had just cheese pizza their whole life
[32:23.860 --> 32:26.080]  and then thought, I'm going to try pepperoni?
[32:26.520 --> 32:28.220]  I'm going to ask for double pepperoni.
[32:28.220 --> 32:29.520]  Double the pepperoni.
[32:31.560 --> 32:34.740]  I'm going to add a priority to getting it right now.
[32:34.820 --> 32:37.460]  Dude, you should get the you should get the salted caramel cold brew, too.
[32:37.520 --> 32:37.940]  But that's just.
[32:38.220 --> 32:39.440]  Oh, I already ordered.
[32:39.560 --> 32:40.560]  I already had. I already had.
[32:40.860 --> 32:42.060]  I already had two coffees today.
[32:42.120 --> 32:42.920]  I can't be having a third.
[32:42.960 --> 32:43.960]  I had I had two.
[32:44.360 --> 32:46.520]  Dude, I had two coffees off the rip today.
[32:46.680 --> 32:47.620]  I woke up so early.
[32:47.760 --> 32:49.440]  I needed it. It was rough.
[32:49.960 --> 32:52.120]  I had a nice little hot coffee in the morning.
[32:52.160 --> 32:55.160]  Then I walked to the coffee shop today and had a nice iced coffee.
[32:55.160 --> 33:00.440]  And I texted Gavin and I was like, I was texting Gavin.
[33:00.540 --> 33:02.540]  I was trying to give us in that we need to live in the same neighborhood
[33:02.540 --> 33:05.440]  because we could do we could have so much fun doing activities
[33:05.440 --> 33:07.080]  and getting up to shenanigans in the daytime.
[33:08.180 --> 33:11.240]  I was trying to explain to him, I feel like I feel like a kid
[33:11.760 --> 33:13.660]  because, you know, I just moved not too long ago.
[33:14.300 --> 33:18.180]  I feel like a kid who is on summer break and just moved to a new neighborhood,
[33:18.180 --> 33:19.920]  but he doesn't know anybody in the neighborhood yet.
[33:19.920 --> 33:22.420]  But he wants to go out and walk around and do stuff and ride bikes.
[33:22.420 --> 33:24.300]  But he just doesn't have any friends in the neighborhood yet.
[33:24.680 --> 33:25.740]  He hasn't met anybody.
[33:26.100 --> 33:26.800]  Kind of frustrating.
[33:27.740 --> 33:29.260]  You did when you first described it.
[33:29.420 --> 33:31.880]  You said it like you're part of the fucking little rascals.
[33:32.200 --> 33:34.260]  And then everything that furthered it.
[33:34.580 --> 33:36.380]  He's running around sticking bananas in his tailpipes.
[33:36.560 --> 33:37.340]  He's doing whatever, man.
[33:37.400 --> 33:38.220]  That's what I want to do.
[33:38.260 --> 33:39.960]  I want to hang out, ride bikes and be a kid.
[33:40.040 --> 33:42.380]  I feel fucking 14 years old all the time.
[33:42.780 --> 33:44.140]  And all I was doing was walking around.
[33:44.220 --> 33:47.060]  I was just seeing shenanigans and fun to get up to.
[33:47.720 --> 33:50.500]  One day we should try and retrace the path we took
[33:51.280 --> 33:53.360]  when we were looking for that thing that one time.
[33:56.500 --> 33:57.460]  Oh, what?
[33:58.540 --> 33:59.600]  Yeah, you got that, man.
[34:00.320 --> 34:02.960]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[34:03.400 --> 34:06.840]  Gavin's talking about this time at Rooster Teeth a million years ago.
[34:06.900 --> 34:10.600]  I think we've talked about it on camera at a bunch at this point where
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.020]  Jack got a thing stolen and we had to try to track it down and find it.
[34:16.200 --> 34:17.280]  And we've just got an expensive.
[34:17.680 --> 34:21.520]  I we I don't see the problem with that was there were that
[34:21.520 --> 34:25.440]  that was a drug dens and crack houses and some real sketch.
[34:25.660 --> 34:28.900]  I wasn't that wasn't my idea of shenanigans.
[34:29.060 --> 34:30.360]  I was going a little lighter with it.
[34:30.400 --> 34:34.260]  But yeah, I think at one point we'd climbed like over a dried up
[34:34.260 --> 34:36.360]  river past some tents and we got kolaches.
[34:37.520 --> 34:40.540]  Some guy took some bad for us and he gave us free kolaches.
[34:40.820 --> 34:43.180]  I mean, at this point, all those places that you went to
[34:43.180 --> 34:45.520]  are probably coffee shops and apartments.
[34:45.880 --> 34:47.380]  So condos. Yeah, exactly.
[34:47.700 --> 34:48.720]  So yeah, that's fun.
[34:49.300 --> 34:50.700]  Yeah, I guess it was 15 years ago.
[34:50.700 --> 34:51.980]  It's going to be a different path, I think.
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.280]  Jesus Christ, I bet we could find that dumpster still.
[34:57.630 --> 35:00.930]  It's funny that I've been in more dumpsters than most people in Austin.
[35:04.890 --> 35:08.550]  Well, yeah, we had to check the dumpsters in case they stashed it
[35:08.550 --> 35:10.430]  or threw it in a dumpster when they realized they couldn't figure out
[35:10.430 --> 35:11.930]  how to make it work because it was a dev kit.
[35:14.090 --> 35:18.250]  I have a topic on my list of notes that is actually your topic, Geoff.
[35:18.550 --> 35:19.750]  I don't know if you want to talk about it.
[35:19.750 --> 35:23.510]  You mentioned wanting to bring it up recently outside of the show.
[35:24.150 --> 35:25.010]  I well, I don't know.
[35:25.310 --> 35:28.950]  You've been you've been having coffee shop delunas recently.
[35:34.380 --> 35:35.720]  We've had problems with the coffee shop.
[35:35.940 --> 35:37.800]  I didn't think you were going to talk about that on the podcast.
[35:38.080 --> 35:40.560]  No, but he brought it up later that he wanted to talk about it.
[35:40.640 --> 35:42.300]  I we have not talked about it in content.
[35:42.480 --> 35:45.040]  I don't remember bringing it up saying I want to talk about it, but we can.
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.800]  I'll speak about it in generic terms.
[35:48.800 --> 35:52.800]  I have I have I have moved to a different part of town.
[35:52.980 --> 35:55.480]  And with that comes changing your habits. Right.
[35:55.520 --> 35:58.160]  So I go to three different coffee shops.
[35:58.320 --> 36:00.720]  Now I have a cycle that I go through because I don't want to be
[36:01.160 --> 36:03.200]  too much of a local in any one place.
[36:03.200 --> 36:05.700]  And I don't want to burn out on a place too quickly.
[36:05.700 --> 36:06.700]  You know, that can happen.
[36:07.380 --> 36:09.900]  And I also want to explore different parts of town, you know.
[36:10.580 --> 36:13.620]  And so I have like three coffee shops, actually four now.
[36:13.680 --> 36:16.620]  I just started going to a different one that I kind of cycle through.
[36:16.620 --> 36:21.300]  But one the one that I go through the most often, I was in line one day
[36:21.300 --> 36:24.480]  and a couple of people in front of me was somebody that I recognized
[36:24.480 --> 36:31.180]  that I used to know in Austin a very, very, very long time ago.
[36:31.800 --> 36:34.460]  And it was somebody that was a friend of a friend.
[36:34.580 --> 36:36.620]  This is pre Rooster Teeth, right?
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.240]  This is back when I worked at the tech support center.
[36:38.720 --> 36:40.240]  We were into the same kind of music.
[36:40.420 --> 36:43.280]  I would run into him at punk shows a lot, that kind of thing.
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.060]  I never knew him very well, and I never got the impression he liked me.
[36:47.900 --> 36:49.840]  And he was always kind of cold to me.
[36:50.180 --> 36:55.940]  And I always kind of felt just like like the dude didn't dig me, which I'll be honest,
[36:55.980 --> 36:58.780]  I get like I'm not everybody's cup of tea.
[36:59.060 --> 37:04.280]  I have had forty nine years of a learning to understand that,
[37:04.340 --> 37:06.280]  but also understand myself and recognize that.
[37:06.340 --> 37:07.800]  Yeah, like I get it, you know.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.560]  And so I never took it personally.
[37:09.720 --> 37:12.320]  I always just I always thought he was a little cooler than me, you know.
[37:12.320 --> 37:14.880]  And like, especially when you're younger and you're in like the punk scene and stuff,
[37:14.900 --> 37:15.720]  it's like there's a whole thing.
[37:16.060 --> 37:19.640]  And so I always just kind of felt like bad about myself around him.
[37:19.700 --> 37:21.220]  So I just I don't know.
[37:22.180 --> 37:24.060]  He was never mean to me or anything like that.
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.020]  He was never anything other than polite, I would say.
[37:27.460 --> 37:30.040]  Just you just like some people you just don't connect with or you just don't.
[37:30.120 --> 37:30.960]  You feel awkward around, right?
[37:30.960 --> 37:31.800]  It was one of those situations.
[37:31.800 --> 37:32.800]  And he was a friend of a friend.
[37:33.380 --> 37:36.920]  And I saw the dude in front of me and I thought, oh, fuck.
[37:37.240 --> 37:39.600]  I don't want to have to talk to him
[37:40.120 --> 37:42.140]  because it's been.
[37:43.800 --> 37:46.160]  Sixteen years, maybe since I've seen him
[37:46.880 --> 37:49.980]  and I remember his name and that's about it,
[37:50.080 --> 37:51.980]  and I'm sure he remembers me in the same way,
[37:52.000 --> 37:56.120]  and I just hate awkward conversations with people that you used to know,
[37:56.200 --> 37:59.060]  you know, like it's like it's just the fucking worst.
[37:59.740 --> 38:02.220]  And and I'm so awkward already.
[38:02.220 --> 38:06.400]  And the older I get, the more awkward I become and the less
[38:06.400 --> 38:09.240]  I want to talk to people in general, let alone people that I
[38:09.600 --> 38:11.920]  thought didn't like me a decade and a half ago.
[38:12.440 --> 38:15.020]  And so I was like, oh, what do I do?
[38:15.120 --> 38:17.380]  And so I just kind of tried to stay behind him.
[38:17.400 --> 38:19.260]  And then he went and sat at a different part of the coffee shop
[38:19.260 --> 38:20.180]  and I went and kind of hid.
[38:20.300 --> 38:21.480]  And I thought, well, close call.
[38:22.200 --> 38:25.900]  And then the next day I went in and he was in the coffee shop.
[38:25.920 --> 38:26.720]  And I thought, that's weird.
[38:26.760 --> 38:30.400]  And so I just left and went to a different coffee shop.
[38:30.700 --> 38:33.060]  And then I thought, well, that's dumb.
[38:33.160 --> 38:34.620]  I'm not going to stop going to a coffee shop
[38:34.620 --> 38:37.540]  because a person who I have no issue with, who I, as far as I know,
[38:37.540 --> 38:41.700]  has no issue with me is at the same coffee shop who I would probably have
[38:41.700 --> 38:44.200]  a pleasant conversation where we would both go like, hey,
[38:44.240 --> 38:45.680]  have you talked to that friend in a long time?
[38:45.680 --> 38:47.540]  And he'd go, yeah, I saw him recently. How about you?
[38:47.860 --> 38:50.160]  No, we really kind of we kind of fell off.
[38:50.260 --> 38:52.000]  Oh, that's too sad. Anyway, have a good life.
[38:52.040 --> 38:52.900]  Hope things are going well with you.
[38:53.040 --> 38:54.460]  Like I can hear the conversation in my head.
[38:54.520 --> 38:55.400]  It's totally pleasant.
[38:55.600 --> 38:57.820]  You know, it's just fucking awkward and I don't want to have it.
[38:57.980 --> 39:00.700]  And if I can hear it in my head, why do I have to hear it out of my mouth?
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.260]  You know, I've already had it in my head.
[39:02.320 --> 39:04.220]  I don't have to actually have it now.
[39:04.720 --> 39:08.580]  And so but I was like, I'm not going to stop going to my coffee shop
[39:08.580 --> 39:11.040]  because of a potentially pleasant conversation.
[39:11.760 --> 39:14.200]  So the next day I go back and he's not there, it's fine.
[39:14.360 --> 39:19.140]  The next time I go back, I get into line and I'm directly behind him.
[39:19.640 --> 39:21.380]  I look up and I'm directly behind him.
[39:21.460 --> 39:24.760]  And I'm like, there's no fucking way that I can avoid this.
[39:24.760 --> 39:30.060]  So I just slowly back up and I just turn around and I sit in a chair
[39:30.060 --> 39:34.800]  and put my head down over my hat down over my eyes and just work on my laptop
[39:36.260 --> 39:39.540]  for 45 minutes until I turn around and I'm like, OK, the coast is clear.
[39:39.620 --> 39:40.480]  And then I go get my coffee.
[39:40.780 --> 39:43.480]  I just figure I'll wait for a while, do the work first, get the coffee later.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.660]  And then two days ago, I walked in
[39:49.320 --> 39:52.240]  and looked up and he was directly in front of me again.
[39:53.020 --> 39:55.920]  And I thought, this is insane.
[39:56.820 --> 39:59.080]  But I'm not going to be the one to make the call.
[39:59.080 --> 40:01.580]  I'm not going to be the one to initiate the conversation,
[40:01.820 --> 40:04.440]  because then I got to thinking, what if he doesn't remember me?
[40:04.560 --> 40:09.280]  Then it's even worse because I've been building this up for weeks, you know?
[40:09.780 --> 40:13.100]  And and so I just tried to be like on a pivot.
[40:13.300 --> 40:19.040]  And so anytime he turned right, I slid left and I just stayed behind him
[40:19.040 --> 40:21.380]  the entire time he was in the coffee shop.
[40:21.440 --> 40:22.720]  And I haven't been back since.
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.260]  Do you think he's having the exact same ordeal as you as a possibility?
[40:27.260 --> 40:29.820]  Or he's never noticed you once?
[40:30.400 --> 40:34.960]  No, I don't know that he could pick me out of a lineup in 2024.
[40:37.040 --> 40:38.860]  But it's torturous to me.
[40:39.000 --> 40:40.180]  And I don't know what to do about it.
[40:40.400 --> 40:43.520]  So is that just what happens after, what do you say, a decade and a half?
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.880]  Probably 15 years, 16 years, somewhere around there.
[40:47.460 --> 40:49.900]  Maybe, maybe longer, dude, maybe longer.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.340]  So say you didn't talk to Eric for 16 years.
[40:52.740 --> 40:56.920]  No, if I saw Eric after 16 years, even before all this bullshit,
[40:56.920 --> 40:59.360]  because I've known Eric for a very long time.
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.120]  I've known Eric since the very early days of RISD.
[41:01.700 --> 41:05.000]  And if I knew him as the Mega64 guy, if I saw him 16 years later,
[41:05.020 --> 41:08.060]  I would absolutely go up to Eric and say hi to him or any of those dudes.
[41:08.240 --> 41:10.360]  I'd have my hat over my eyes working on my laptop.
[41:10.480 --> 41:12.300]  He would be doing that, but I wouldn't.
[41:12.400 --> 41:13.700]  No, I'd be like, oh, hey, what's up, dude?
[41:13.900 --> 41:16.500]  Because we I always get the impression Eric liked me.
[41:16.780 --> 41:19.280]  And we were we had a friendlier relationship than I do.
[41:19.560 --> 41:21.360]  I do. I certainly do like you.
[41:21.580 --> 41:23.800]  I well, thanks. I think I think you should.
[41:24.340 --> 41:26.780]  I think you don't have to talk to this guy or what.
[41:26.780 --> 41:27.760]  You don't have to do anything.
[41:27.940 --> 41:30.480]  I think that you are you're making an obligation for yourself.
[41:30.560 --> 41:31.440]  I think you should keep going.
[41:31.560 --> 41:33.880]  And that should be your spot. That's your place.
[41:35.060 --> 41:36.820]  It's not it's not my spot.
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.860]  It is most definitely his spot because he knows every barista by name
[41:40.860 --> 41:45.200]  and they have conversations which take a while, which makes it really hard
[41:45.200 --> 41:48.720]  to try to stay behind him ducking and weaving while he's animated
[41:48.720 --> 41:51.560]  and having a long conversation with a dude whose first and last name
[41:51.560 --> 41:54.120]  he seems to know. It's his place, not mine.
[41:54.900 --> 41:56.540]  That's definitely his face. You're right.
[41:56.640 --> 41:59.780]  Yeah, I just I think you got to go somewhere else.
[41:59.780 --> 42:00.880]  I think you got to.
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.320]  That's well, that's what I've been doing.
[42:02.640 --> 42:05.800]  And every time I come back, I go every time I come back,
[42:05.840 --> 42:06.760]  I run into the motherfucker.
[42:06.920 --> 42:09.460]  I even decided to go earlier one day.
[42:09.520 --> 42:13.480]  I went two hours earlier and it was one of the days I almost walked into him.
[42:13.540 --> 42:14.300]  I was right behind him.
[42:15.700 --> 42:16.400]  That's awesome.
[42:16.700 --> 42:19.260]  Really funny twist of it turns out he works there.
[42:19.680 --> 42:21.940]  And that's yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:21.940 --> 42:23.440]  He's like he's like the night shift guy.
[42:23.440 --> 42:25.220]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[42:26.440 --> 42:27.300]  That's funny, Andrew.
[42:27.380 --> 42:29.420]  I had kind of forgotten about that as content.
[42:29.700 --> 42:33.300]  If you work at a coffee shop, though, you don't walk out from behind the counter
[42:33.300 --> 42:34.180]  and get in line, do you?
[42:34.280 --> 42:36.300]  If you want to talk to him and order a coffee
[42:37.980 --> 42:40.420]  and then ask them what tacos they have left.
[42:41.400 --> 42:43.280]  You fucking you just sold the last taco.
[42:43.400 --> 42:46.700]  You know, you sell the tacos, then you go around to the front of the counter
[42:46.700 --> 42:48.640]  and make someone tell you what tacos you have left.
[42:49.860 --> 42:51.220]  Oh, man, we're out of stock.
[42:51.540 --> 42:53.020]  Fuck. God damn it.
[42:53.440 --> 42:55.840]  Speaking of stuff we have talked about off camera
[42:55.840 --> 42:58.940]  that should make its way on camera at some point.
[42:59.020 --> 43:01.180]  Do you guys think we should talk about potato range?
[43:02.380 --> 43:03.100]  Yeah. Do you remember that?
[43:03.800 --> 43:08.520]  Potato range was when you were having potato chips for breakfast
[43:08.520 --> 43:11.980]  and Nick told you that was not an appropriate time to eat potatoes.
[43:12.520 --> 43:14.920]  And then we were like, but what about hash browns?
[43:14.920 --> 43:17.640]  And then we realized that there is a rain.
[43:17.840 --> 43:20.940]  There are ranges throughout the day when it's appropriate to eat
[43:20.940 --> 43:25.720]  certain types of potato and inappropriate to eat other types of potato.
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.500]  And we wanted to explore that a little bit.
[43:28.820 --> 43:29.900]  Yeah. Potato range is vast.
[43:30.100 --> 43:31.900]  Yeah. Well, we got to like take each meal of the day
[43:31.900 --> 43:34.240]  and file the potatoes into each one.
[43:34.560 --> 43:36.020]  Yeah. Like breakfast, lunch, dinner.
[43:36.400 --> 43:40.820]  Yeah. The idea being that it's the same ingredient, but it's prepared differently
[43:40.820 --> 43:44.900]  and how it's prepared shifts when it is appropriate to eat said thing
[43:44.900 --> 43:49.060]  like a hash brown is only appropriate for breakfast.
[43:49.060 --> 43:52.180]  But if someone gave you like mashed potato and gravy for breakfast,
[43:52.300 --> 43:53.400]  you'd be like, oh, a bit heavy.
[43:53.600 --> 43:56.180]  That is that is the wrong time of day to eat that kind of potato.
[43:56.340 --> 44:00.260]  Right. I would even argue like mashed potato and gravy is only appropriate
[44:00.260 --> 44:03.100]  at dinner. Nobody's having mashed potatoes at lunch.
[44:03.960 --> 44:06.660]  What if you had like a fat, like a chicken pot pie or something?
[44:06.740 --> 44:07.560]  It came with a bit of mash.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.200]  I guess it feels like a dinner food to me.
[44:10.320 --> 44:10.920]  It really does.
[44:11.680 --> 44:15.380]  But like French fries feel like dinner and lunch.
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.160]  Is there a potato that crosses all three meals?
[44:19.400 --> 44:22.620]  Um, what's the type of potato, whether you use the foil
[44:22.620 --> 44:25.360]  and it's like sliced potato? Baked?
[44:26.640 --> 44:27.860]  Au gratin? Yeah.
[44:28.880 --> 44:32.180]  Au gratin would not be a breakfast potato, I wouldn't think.
[44:32.280 --> 44:34.760]  That'd be all. That's another one I would only think for dinner.
[44:35.300 --> 44:37.040]  I feel like it. I don't.
[44:37.160 --> 44:39.900]  If they had to have it for breakfast, it would work.
[44:40.640 --> 44:42.080]  It could. It could. Maybe.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.620]  Or maybe most potatoes for breakfast, if you had to.
[44:46.340 --> 44:48.640]  But do people have like potato pancakes, right?
[44:48.640 --> 44:49.680]  Potato cakes? Yeah.
[44:50.080 --> 44:51.600]  Yeah. Oh, those are so good.
[44:51.800 --> 44:52.740]  Homestyle potatoes.
[44:53.520 --> 44:55.720]  Homestyle potatoes. Yeah, home fries.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.680]  Like these immediately?
[44:58.480 --> 44:59.900]  What what meal do you eat these with?
[45:00.200 --> 45:01.720]  Only breakfast. It's breakfast.
[45:01.940 --> 45:03.600]  But I think you could do them.
[45:04.200 --> 45:07.420]  I think you can do them up and then they're not just breakfast
[45:07.420 --> 45:08.840]  and you don't have to do much.
[45:08.920 --> 45:10.880]  And all of a sudden that's a dinner side.
[45:10.960 --> 45:11.860]  You can have that for lunch.
[45:12.200 --> 45:15.020]  You're right. It's about it's about how you dress it.
[45:15.220 --> 45:16.860]  I think. I agree. I think that's what it is.
[45:16.860 --> 45:21.060]  What's funny about the top one, though, is that's all like I assume chopped up
[45:21.060 --> 45:22.080]  first and then cooked.
[45:22.220 --> 45:25.200]  But if you just cook it the same way without chopping it up,
[45:25.520 --> 45:26.820]  it's much more of a dinner potato.
[45:27.640 --> 45:28.940]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[45:29.440 --> 45:31.740]  So even like the time of slicing effects.
[45:33.140 --> 45:34.700]  It's tough. It's tough.
[45:36.200 --> 45:37.920]  Would you ever have a bake?
[45:38.020 --> 45:40.740]  Could you ever see a baked potato as a breakfast food?
[45:40.760 --> 45:42.520]  Because it's got chives.
[45:42.700 --> 45:43.680]  We gotta try it.
[45:44.020 --> 45:44.880]  We have to try it.
[45:45.040 --> 45:45.940]  We got to have a break.
[45:45.940 --> 45:48.220]  We have to have a baked potato for breakfast.
[45:48.320 --> 45:49.800]  A breakfast baked potato, right?
[45:50.280 --> 45:53.400]  Oh, I don't think that exists, but I think it needs to.
[45:53.560 --> 45:55.300]  We need to invent a bacon on it.
[45:55.820 --> 45:58.520]  Well, it's got to have bacon instead of bacon bits.
[45:58.560 --> 46:00.640]  It's got bacon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:00.720 --> 46:01.680]  Big old jacket potatoes.
[46:01.760 --> 46:03.780]  You sometimes in England will put baked beans in them,
[46:04.320 --> 46:08.080]  which is typically a breakfast food, but I've never had that for breakfast.
[46:08.580 --> 46:10.660]  So a baked potato with beans in it.
[46:11.240 --> 46:12.720]  Yeah, I like that.
[46:13.340 --> 46:14.720]  It's not bad. I've had that recently.
[46:14.720 --> 46:16.680]  Like it becomes like a little bean boat.
[46:17.640 --> 46:20.100]  Yeah. Are baked beans considered a breakfast food?
[46:20.780 --> 46:21.160]  In England?
[46:21.720 --> 46:23.120]  I mean, it's part of the full English.
[46:23.200 --> 46:25.460]  Typically, you can't have them any time, though.
[46:26.040 --> 46:27.800]  I just associate them with breakfast much more.
[46:27.880 --> 46:29.860]  Yeah, I was going to say, I view them more as a dinner, personally.
[46:30.820 --> 46:31.180]  Oh, really?
[46:32.060 --> 46:33.300]  Yeah. Like a dinner side.
[46:33.840 --> 46:37.480]  I feel like you need some good shredded cheese on a on a baked potato.
[46:37.740 --> 46:40.100]  That fits for breakfast or for lunch, right?
[46:40.140 --> 46:41.520]  Like cheese is a big part of breakfast.
[46:42.000 --> 46:42.760]  A runny egg.
[46:43.340 --> 46:44.300]  Runny egg.
[46:47.340 --> 46:49.260]  Eric, you want to throw anything in the mix?
[46:50.560 --> 46:53.940]  No, I feel like I mean, like runny egg, you got bacon.
[46:55.500 --> 46:57.820]  What else can like I'm thinking of like garnish.
[46:59.240 --> 47:01.860]  Right, right. Like a jalapeno or something.
[47:03.280 --> 47:07.620]  What about like like the like on that first picture that I sent of the homestyle
[47:07.620 --> 47:12.340]  potato with that is like little diced onion that's kind of like fried, diced
[47:12.340 --> 47:14.880]  like that kind of onion.
[47:15.180 --> 47:18.640]  Like I think that would be like very small kind of tossed on top.
[47:18.720 --> 47:19.600]  I think would be very nice.
[47:19.780 --> 47:22.280]  Diced and fried onion. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:22.500 --> 47:23.540]  Love that. So here's what we have.
[47:23.660 --> 47:25.860]  We have our breakfast baked potato right now.
[47:26.140 --> 47:27.440]  It's got beans in it.
[47:27.700 --> 47:29.080]  It's got full bacon.
[47:29.240 --> 47:30.520]  It's got cheese.
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.420]  It's got runny egg and diced and fried onions.
[47:34.780 --> 47:37.580]  I just found a recipe that looks so good.
[47:38.100 --> 47:41.680]  Twice baked breakfast potatoes is the recipe for this sandwich.
[47:42.340 --> 47:46.220]  Oh, I just had this baked again for the egg.
[47:46.460 --> 47:47.720]  Yeah, there you go. That's just about right.
[47:47.980 --> 47:48.400]  That looks great.
[47:49.000 --> 47:50.440]  That's exactly what we want.
[47:50.660 --> 47:54.020]  I mean, a twice baked potato is essentially, you know, you baked potato.
[47:54.180 --> 47:54.840]  You hollow it out.
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.320]  You make like a mashed potato with it.
[47:56.320 --> 47:58.480]  You put it back in and recook it.
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.300]  Do you guys do you guys think the potato is the most versatile of foods?
[48:02.660 --> 48:04.600]  It's it's probably up there.
[48:04.820 --> 48:05.480]  Yeah, right.
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.960]  Because I was sitting here thinking like this is such a great segment.
[48:08.060 --> 48:10.280]  And I in the back of my head, I've been trying to figure out
[48:10.280 --> 48:13.020]  what else we would apply this to that could span three meals.
[48:13.140 --> 48:16.860]  And it's hard to find something else that is as much of a Swiss Army
[48:16.860 --> 48:19.560]  like a culinary Swiss Army knife as potato.
[48:19.900 --> 48:22.000]  Could you sous vide a potato?
[48:23.220 --> 48:24.880]  100 percent. 100 percent.
[48:24.980 --> 48:27.600]  Yeah. Yeah. It'd be like the best baked potato ever.
[48:29.660 --> 48:31.180]  A little like vacuum bag.
[48:34.020 --> 48:37.840]  We should when we make our our regulation breakfast baked potato,
[48:38.060 --> 48:39.060]  we should sous vide them.
[48:39.060 --> 48:43.020]  Yeah, we should we should all potentially bring in a new format for potatoes
[48:43.020 --> 48:46.260]  as well as our rankings for potato meals.
[48:48.540 --> 48:50.060]  Interesting. A new format.
[48:51.060 --> 48:52.720]  I wonder if you could have.
[48:53.780 --> 48:57.520]  Those twice baked potatoes, if you could just recombine the halves
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.240]  and make the best single potato, you could re-potato.
[49:01.620 --> 49:03.860]  Yeah, I just had an idea.
[49:03.900 --> 49:04.620]  I don't want to spoil it.
[49:04.640 --> 49:06.000]  I just had an idea for what I want to do.
[49:06.660 --> 49:07.540]  Re-potatoed beans?
[49:07.880 --> 49:10.680]  No, no, it's not.
[49:12.460 --> 49:13.340]  When are we doing this?
[49:13.420 --> 49:15.720]  What are we when are we going to present our ideas and stuff?
[49:15.820 --> 49:17.300]  Because we entering a spud era.
[49:17.680 --> 49:18.540]  Are we entering it? Yeah.
[49:20.400 --> 49:22.720]  I'm going to need some time in the lab, I think, to come up with mine.
[49:23.180 --> 49:26.080]  Yeah, I think I'm going to need a little bit of lab time as well.
[49:26.640 --> 49:29.420]  Maybe we'll revisit this idea in the next episode.
[49:30.020 --> 49:32.780]  I do think we still need to have our potato draft.
[49:32.900 --> 49:34.160]  We've been discussing that for a while,
[49:34.540 --> 49:36.720]  and I think we were going to try to get Gracie in that one if we can.
[49:36.720 --> 49:40.720]  Hopefully. But in addition, in addition to that, we've got to put it on the books.
[49:40.980 --> 49:42.060]  Breakfast baked potato.
[49:42.160 --> 49:45.720]  We'll get into the we'll get into the flavor lab and we'll make something happen
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.200]  and then we can all come up with our own new potato inventions as well.
[49:49.900 --> 49:50.520]  I love it.
[49:51.020 --> 49:53.500]  I think that is a fantastic idea.
[49:54.220 --> 49:57.200]  Ken, could you think of the quickest
[49:57.880 --> 49:59.800]  you destroyed an item that you bought?
[50:00.680 --> 50:04.640]  I bought a computer once with Gus
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.500]  and I bought some RAM and he was showing me how to do it.
[50:09.660 --> 50:12.820]  And somehow I flipped the RAM around backwards,
[50:13.020 --> 50:16.920]  but I was still able to jam it in, even though it didn't fit.
[50:17.440 --> 50:19.240]  And Gus said it was one of the most impressive things he'd ever seen.
[50:19.380 --> 50:21.840]  And that fucked my motherboard and the RAM up instantly.
[50:22.120 --> 50:24.580]  That's crazy, because they're usually like keyed a certain way.
[50:24.640 --> 50:25.900]  Yeah, it was keyed a certain way.
[50:25.980 --> 50:27.560]  Yeah, it was. It was like off balance.
[50:27.680 --> 50:29.220]  You shouldn't have fit. Yeah, it was.
[50:29.360 --> 50:30.500]  He was pretty blown away, too.
[50:31.080 --> 50:32.400]  Mine also involves keying.
[50:33.880 --> 50:39.480]  I bought some stuff from the Home Depot and I need a padlock.
[50:39.620 --> 50:42.580]  So I bought one. A lot of the time when I'm, if I'm getting an Uber or something,
[50:42.640 --> 50:45.480]  I'll just take all the stuff out of the packaging when I walk out of the store
[50:45.480 --> 50:48.200]  and just throw it away. So I'm not having to throw it away at home.
[50:48.440 --> 50:52.760]  And on the way home in the Uber, I managed to padlock the keys to the padlock.
[50:54.340 --> 50:55.340]  Like on the loop.
[50:56.460 --> 50:58.560]  And I got home and I was like, I can't undo this.
[51:01.980 --> 51:02.980]  It was just fiddling.
[51:04.520 --> 51:06.580]  Have you picked your lock yet to get your keys?
[51:07.320 --> 51:07.520]  No!
[51:10.380 --> 51:16.300]  It was a few years ago but the other day I found the padlocks with two keys on the hoop.
[51:18.460 --> 51:19.900]  That's fucking awesome.
[51:21.860 --> 51:23.000]  Such a waste of money.
[51:25.600 --> 51:28.340]  I'd love to see a photo at some point. If you find it, again.
[51:28.340 --> 51:33.140]  Yeah, I should have taken a picture of it. Oh, man. Oh, man. Speaking of a waste of money,
[51:33.160 --> 51:38.500]  I finished Terminator Salvation. What a waste of money that was. I know you guys don't remember
[51:38.500 --> 51:41.220]  because it was a million years ago, but that movie's a real piece of shit. It ends with
[51:41.220 --> 51:46.480]  a... it ends with a robot giving Christian Bale a heart. Oh, right. What? In the middle
[51:46.480 --> 51:49.060]  of the fucking... like on the battlefield. I don't remember it. Yeah, and he's like,
[51:49.060 --> 51:53.400]  you can have my heart. And it's like, yeah, that'll work, sure. His heart's bad, so we'll
[51:53.400 --> 51:57.320]  just... yeah, open heart, sir. Yeah, it's no problem. It's the future, right? But I
[51:57.320 --> 52:02.280]  have been, you know, I'm in my entertainment era now that I'm ignoring the news and the
[52:02.280 --> 52:06.820]  world at large. I have discovered a new television show, and I liked it quite a bit, and I wanted
[52:06.820 --> 52:10.020]  to tell you guys about it in case you haven't seen it yet. Are you guys familiar with...
[52:10.620 --> 52:17.280]  are you guys familiar with Interior Chinatown? No. No. It is on Hulu. You guys should check
[52:17.280 --> 52:22.320]  it out. It's very funny. Taika Waititi... it's not a Taika Waititi film, but he's one
[52:22.320 --> 52:26.100]  of the producers, and I think he directed the first episode. And it's just about these
[52:26.100 --> 52:31.540]  dudes that... I don't want to spoil it because the whole premise of the show is kind of
[52:31.540 --> 52:36.840]  the charm, but it's just about some guys who feel like they're background characters in
[52:36.840 --> 52:41.480]  other people's lives, and they just, like, work at a Chinese restaurant. And it's just...
[52:41.480 --> 52:44.880]  it's very funny and very clever, and it's got Ronny Chieng in it, who I like quite a
[52:44.880 --> 52:48.180]  bit from The Daily Show. Yeah, it's him and Jimmy O. Yang, right? Yeah, Jimmy O. Yang's
[52:48.180 --> 52:51.400]  in it as well. He's, like, the main character. Yeah. That's cool. I've seen the previews for
[52:51.400 --> 52:55.440]  it. I thought it looked really interesting. It looks really, like, off the wall. It's
[52:55.440 --> 53:00.320]  very off the wall. And after I watched it, and then I saw that Taika Waititi directed it,
[53:00.320 --> 53:03.820]  I was like, oh, okay, that makes sense. Because it feels very much like that. I don't know that
[53:03.820 --> 53:07.660]  the premise will last... it's like 10 episodes. I don't know that the premise will hold throughout,
[53:07.880 --> 53:13.880]  but the first episode was great. Cool. So that's my recommendation. That's fun. I recently watched
[53:13.880 --> 53:22.160]  season 10 of Love Island UK, and I'm convinced that if you cut out every time they said, bro,
[53:22.600 --> 53:27.860]  obviously, do you know what I mean? Or at the end of the day, there'd be, like, 20 less episodes.
[53:28.720 --> 53:35.280]  What if, like, 17 seasons into Love Island, they introduced the smoke monster? What if it just
[53:35.280 --> 53:39.920]  slowly turns into the island from Lost? That would be so cool. They have to put the numbers
[53:39.920 --> 53:45.500]  into a computer on Love Island. That would be... Desmond's there. Oh, hell yeah. Hey, guys,
[53:45.520 --> 53:51.200]  I'll be right back. I'm going to go get my Starbucks. Oh, awesome. What a way to end this
[53:51.200 --> 53:57.660]  episode. This rocks. This is so cool. What other shows should have Lost in them? I think Love
[53:57.660 --> 54:01.460]  Island should just put a hatch in the ground of the next season and see if anyone notices it.
[54:01.880 --> 54:05.020]  Yeah. Well, they open the hatch and the light comes out big style and it's like,
[54:05.360 --> 54:10.160]  that was like the best. That was so cool. Hell yeah. I think this is a great idea. That would
[54:10.160 --> 54:14.620]  make me watch Love Island. If all of a sudden it's like, well, no, it's like Lost. I would be
[54:14.620 --> 54:19.200]  like, oh, shit, I got to watch this, I think. That would be sick. There was a show called
[54:19.980 --> 54:29.040]  Siberia, I think, on the Syfy channel. And the premise was survivor meets Lost. And it was
[54:29.040 --> 54:34.820]  terrible. But I like the idea of it a lot where it's like they're filming a survivor based reality
[54:34.820 --> 54:39.280]  show in the woods, but then a smoke monster appears and it just... Oh, here we go. Oh,
[54:39.280 --> 54:42.060]  guys, Geoff is here. You got to record this.
[54:46.140 --> 54:50.740]  Hello, boys. Hello. Cool hat, by the way. That's what I said. Thank you. Thank you very much.
[54:50.800 --> 54:55.440]  Andrew complimented the other day. It's great. It's that fashion show I went out of town for.
[54:55.600 --> 55:02.760]  Nice. All right, here we go. So how does it look in terms of cranberries?
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.800]  So I ordered extra cranberries. I paid an extra 98 cents. That's extra cranberries.
[55:10.140 --> 55:14.640]  Oh, there we go. There they are. I got a bunch right against the wall here.
[55:14.880 --> 55:21.240]  They don't seem to be anywhere else. It's like they're trying to escape by climbing on top of
[55:21.240 --> 55:25.740]  each other. That makes it nice and accessible. I'm just going to take a drink. So this is like
[55:25.740 --> 55:30.300]  a lemonade. I don't even know what I got. Yeah, it's got some warm spices in it. So you got kind
[55:30.300 --> 55:36.640]  of the seasonal kick with it as well. Oh, it's real good. Oh, he likes it. It's real good. He
[55:36.640 --> 55:40.260]  really likes it. But wait until he starts chewing down on these cranberries. He's going to love it,
[55:40.260 --> 55:46.660]  right? Boys, that's flavor. That's real good. That's real fucking good right there. This is
[55:46.660 --> 55:52.560]  not an ad for Starbucks or anything, but Jesus Christ. I want to get a cranberry reaction.
[55:52.720 --> 55:58.380]  Okay, so now you know the flavor. Does it taste like cranberries as a taste?
[55:58.380 --> 56:04.320]  Yeah, it's like a like an ocean spray kind of flavor. Cool. So here's the cranberry in question.
[56:04.500 --> 56:17.970]  It's sliced, as Andrew said. It looks almost like a cherry. That's fine. There's nothing wrong with
[56:17.970 --> 56:24.910]  that. Tastes like food. It's eatable. It tastes like a cranberry. It's edible. But what if more
[56:24.910 --> 56:29.370]  is better? What if you had a whole handful at once? Yeah, what if you need a bunch? Because you're
[56:29.370 --> 56:32.910]  only getting... you're not even eating one whole cranberry that way, you know what I mean? You have
[56:32.910 --> 56:40.970]  as many as I... Yeah, have a fist of cran. This is most of them. Fist of cran. I don't know if you
[56:40.970 --> 56:51.250]  can see here. Oh, that's so many. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh, it's gonna be so sour.
[56:53.410 --> 56:55.590]  Like a fucking murder scene over here.
[57:03.350 --> 57:06.530]  It's definitely not the best part of the drink, but it's totally fine.
[57:09.810 --> 57:18.680]  Okay, I feel less bad about eating them now. I don't think Gavin's right. They're definitely
[57:18.680 --> 57:22.060]  edible and they wouldn't put them in if they weren't. But I don't know that you're intended
[57:22.060 --> 57:25.660]  to eat it. I think it's supposed to be more like a lemon. That's what I'm thinking. You get the
[57:25.660 --> 57:35.000]  essence of it. The cherry at the bottom of a root 44. But it's not bad. And I actually thought that
[57:35.000 --> 57:40.500]  they were pretty yummy, like not the best or anything, but they weren't hard to eat or anything.
[57:41.960 --> 57:49.460]  So cheers. Cheers. That's great, Geoff. What a way. What a way to do that. What a way to end it
[57:49.460 --> 57:57.840]  for us, too. That was that was a fun one. Very food centric. Geoff was a little rascal. This was
[57:57.840 --> 58:02.960]  exciting. This was this was a really fun one. Why don't you who wants to do the cool outro?
[58:02.960 --> 58:05.380]  Oh, I think Andrew has the biggest beard.
[58:08.580 --> 58:12.020]  Oh, you don't have a beard anymore? I can just say whatever I wanted.
[58:16.720 --> 58:21.380]  I can't imagine how big Andrew's beard is at this point. It's not. It's about the same.
[58:22.500 --> 58:29.200]  Stagnated, I'd say. Same as what? The same as what? Last time I checked. Um, this sucks.
[58:29.200 --> 58:38.260]  Well, there you have it. Andrew's beard is exactly the same as the last time he checked. How's your
[58:38.260 --> 58:46.100]  beard doing? Do you have one? What length is it? Has it grown since you looked at it? Let us know
[58:46.940 --> 58:52.200]  over there at the Patreon. Andrew's going to hit you with the Patreon domain real fast.
[58:53.480 --> 59:00.160]  RegulationPod on Patreon. All right. And go there if you want the RegulationPod on Patreon.
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.680]  What? What? It's just the way, I mean, you could just give the URL. It's what you were doing with
[59:04.680 --> 59:08.860]  Twitch the other day, where you were just like the RegulationPod at Twitch. And it's like,
[59:08.920 --> 59:13.860]  just say twitch.tv slash the RegulationPod, like give the URL. Do you see, Andrew, there's a spirit
[59:13.860 --> 59:21.400]  to it. I agree. Here's the thing. I've recorded like 60 segments in the past two days. I'm a
[59:21.400 --> 59:26.800]  little gone. I'm a little tired. I apologize. No apology necessary. Keep it on fire. We hope
[59:26.800 --> 59:31.440]  you enjoyed the episode. We do hope you'll check out that Patreon Andrew mentioned. Also, don't
[59:31.440 --> 59:36.440]  forget we are on YouTube. If you go down there, you can check out our regulation gameplays,
[59:36.460 --> 59:40.580]  as well as the video versions of these podcasts. They have images of some of the things that we
[59:40.580 --> 59:46.340]  talk about sometimes. And we'll be right here next week. Hopefully you'll see us. We'll talk
[59:46.340 --> 59:52.240]  about something really fun and exciting. Like, uh, uh, what's something fun and exciting we
[59:52.240 --> 59:57.000]  could talk about? Hey, you know, it'd be really crazy, Geoff. What's that, Andrew? Imagine if you
[59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.900]  took all the audio feeds of a podcast, then line them up and played them. That'd be crazy.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.260]  I think I might do that. You know, it's like when if you're going to make a trail mix,
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:10.740]  so you get each item individually and then you put them together and see how they look. Like,
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:14.540]  what if we took all the individual audio tracks, line them up?
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.740]  What if? That's a great idea, Andrew. And while you're trying that, think about this. What if
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:25.980]  you could only wear clothes you buy at the airport? What would your outfits look like?
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.300]  Who would you be? We'll see you next week. Bye-bye. Bye.
