[00:00.000 --> 00:03.680]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.100 --> 00:06.440]  This is episode 32. Nick's already laughing.
[00:06.580 --> 00:09.140]  That means it's going to be a really good one for some reason.
[00:09.420 --> 00:12.260]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free,
[00:12.620 --> 00:15.120]  the aforementioned Nick and Eric Baudour.
[00:15.580 --> 00:16.240]  I have an announcement.
[00:16.820 --> 00:19.200]  Oh, my God. You got your dick back?
[00:19.900 --> 00:21.740]  Oh, nice. No, I'm still waiting on that.
[00:22.200 --> 00:24.520]  My announcement is I think I'm done with bagels.
[00:25.580 --> 00:29.640]  They're always like a six out of ten, maybe a seven.
[00:29.640 --> 00:32.420]  And I don't think I've ever had above a seven out of ten.
[00:32.540 --> 00:35.080]  And I should just stop expecting that from bagels.
[00:35.220 --> 00:36.780]  So seven out of ten is high.
[00:37.000 --> 00:38.240]  You don't think it is very high.
[00:38.440 --> 00:39.700]  You don't think that
[00:40.540 --> 00:43.100]  you don't think it has anything to do with like your location?
[00:43.460 --> 00:44.760]  Have like playing in that at all?
[00:44.860 --> 00:45.580]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:46.320 --> 00:48.260]  Of being in Texas? Wait.
[00:48.500 --> 00:50.500]  Yeah, they suck here. Yeah, that's true.
[00:51.060 --> 00:52.860]  It is a regional thing, Gavin.
[00:53.060 --> 00:55.780]  Wait, you said seven out of ten is high?
[00:56.300 --> 01:00.040]  Yeah. Tell that to every tell that to every teacher
[01:00.040 --> 01:03.300]  and my parents every time I got a 75 on a fucking test.
[01:03.420 --> 01:06.560]  No, honestly, Geoff, if you're getting 75 on tests, I'd be pretty proud of you.
[01:06.900 --> 01:10.160]  The the thing about it is that seven out of ten for a food
[01:10.160 --> 01:13.140]  is really high to say I'm done with this thing forever.
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.220]  But I feel like eventually I should be stumbling across eights and nines
[01:17.220 --> 01:19.180]  and I'm just stuck at the ceiling. You're insane.
[01:19.580 --> 01:23.400]  I think he's saying, yeah, if he if a food has a ceiling of a seven,
[01:23.400 --> 01:24.580]  what's the fucking point?
[01:24.940 --> 01:27.840]  A seven is a really high ceiling for a food.
[01:28.140 --> 01:30.900]  How much food are you eating under seven?
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.420]  And let me let me just throw this out here.
[01:33.780 --> 01:35.320]  He's getting a seven out of ten.
[01:35.400 --> 01:38.840]  And all he has to do is fucking put it in a toaster and spread something on it.
[01:38.960 --> 01:41.780]  The amount of effort to seven is so minimal.
[01:42.120 --> 01:43.480]  It's an insane thing to cut.
[01:43.560 --> 01:46.780]  Now you're a fool because sometimes sometimes I can put in bread
[01:46.780 --> 01:48.880]  and just slop a bit of peanut butter on it, peanut butter and toast.
[01:49.020 --> 01:51.000]  I could easily get a ten on that. Yeah.
[01:51.200 --> 01:52.520]  OK, well, then just do that.
[01:52.520 --> 01:55.240]  I don't. Well, I think that's what he's saying he's doing.
[01:55.660 --> 01:56.980]  You ever get nervous, Charlie's?
[01:57.260 --> 02:00.040]  Like what? Where are you getting your bagels, I guess, is my question.
[02:01.140 --> 02:02.820]  Yeah, uh, whatever.
[02:03.560 --> 02:04.700]  OK, this is all right.
[02:04.780 --> 02:06.360]  Name one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:06.360 --> 02:07.540]  See, this is what happened.
[02:07.760 --> 02:08.800]  You start poking holes.
[02:08.880 --> 02:10.520]  You're going grocery store bagels.
[02:10.620 --> 02:11.980]  Are you going to like a bakery?
[02:12.100 --> 02:14.240]  What what type of establishment?
[02:14.640 --> 02:16.100]  I'll hit up H-E-B, I'll hit up
[02:18.220 --> 02:20.440]  bloody some places that do bagels.
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.200]  All right, Gav, here's the deal.
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.260]  There are three what I would consider to be decent bagel shops in Austin.
[02:26.480 --> 02:29.940]  I will agree with you that bagels in Austin are after
[02:29.940 --> 02:33.900]  living on the East Coast are largely shitty bagels in New Jersey.
[02:33.900 --> 02:35.700]  It's a whole it's like the breakfast taco of New Jersey.
[02:35.700 --> 02:37.780]  It's a whole other world up there, what they do with a bagel.
[02:37.860 --> 02:38.320]  It's amazing.
[02:38.860 --> 02:41.800]  You would love you could find an eight and a half easily over there.
[02:42.280 --> 02:45.140]  But in Austin, we have three places that I would I think are considered
[02:45.140 --> 02:45.980]  the good spots.
[02:46.220 --> 02:49.640]  Biedermann's Deli, which is where I would always get my pastrami back in the day.
[02:49.900 --> 02:51.820]  That's a that's a that's a hot bagel house right there.
[02:51.820 --> 02:52.380]  A lot of bagels.
[02:52.500 --> 02:55.420]  Then you've got Rockstar Bagels over on the east side,
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.640]  which I personally think is incredibly overrated and you should completely avoid.
[03:00.160 --> 03:02.920]  And then that place Eric mentioned, Nervous Charlie's on Lamar.
[03:03.420 --> 03:05.480]  Nervous Charlie's is where I get my sevens from.
[03:05.800 --> 03:07.260]  Yeah, I mean, they're definitely the best I'm getting.
[03:07.560 --> 03:10.340]  I would say Nervous Charlie's is like a seven out of ten bagel spot.
[03:11.280 --> 03:12.640]  What type of bagels are you getting?
[03:14.140 --> 03:17.780]  The last bagel I got was it was a plain bagel.
[03:17.820 --> 03:19.820]  You fucking creep. Ridiculous.
[03:19.820 --> 03:21.960]  Well, let me finish. Let me finish.
[03:23.560 --> 03:27.160]  Plain bagel, low fat cream cheese, avocado, tomato.
[03:28.380 --> 03:29.740]  Well, the toppings aren't the thing.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.580]  It's the you're retiring the bagel for toast when you're just having a plain bagel.
[03:34.960 --> 03:38.500]  The whole joy of the bagel is the variety of the types of bagel you can get.
[03:39.160 --> 03:40.840]  There's no everything toast.
[03:41.100 --> 03:42.900]  There's nothing worse than an everything bagel.
[03:42.980 --> 03:44.160]  That thing, that's a piece of shit.
[03:44.180 --> 03:47.360]  I don't want all that shite. Insane bagel takes.
[03:47.360 --> 03:48.720]  Yeah, I got it. I got it.
[03:48.780 --> 03:49.920]  I'm on Andrew's side on that one.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.080]  Everything is pretty awesome.
[03:51.360 --> 03:54.800]  But I got to swing back to Gavin and defend a plain bagel.
[03:54.880 --> 03:58.180]  Should you should be able to get an eight or a nine on a plain bagel?
[03:58.240 --> 03:59.900]  Oh, I agree. And I do regularly.
[04:00.400 --> 04:01.720]  OK, well, what do you go for?
[04:01.780 --> 04:04.200]  What's your bagel build? What's your loadout?
[04:04.700 --> 04:05.420]  I'm going to be honest.
[04:05.740 --> 04:08.900]  I haven't had a bagel since my husband's bagels went away and the regulation.
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.860]  Oh, no, I just haven't.
[04:10.900 --> 04:12.860]  I haven't been able to find that love again, but they're great.
[04:13.440 --> 04:14.240]  They're a great food.
[04:15.040 --> 04:15.820]  But what do you go for?
[04:18.920 --> 04:19.740]  Do you not remember?
[04:20.480 --> 04:20.820]  What do you mean?
[04:21.580 --> 04:22.800]  What do you mean what I mean?
[04:23.200 --> 04:24.160]  What was the regulation?
[04:24.200 --> 04:25.360]  Bagel was the regulation.
[04:25.620 --> 04:27.420]  It was a regulation bagel.
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.320]  Oh, what was it?
[04:29.340 --> 04:30.760]  It was a two types of cream cheese.
[04:30.840 --> 04:31.640]  It was a bacon.
[04:32.380 --> 04:35.380]  Listen, this was a long time ago, and I've had to try to repress these memories.
[04:35.960 --> 04:39.320]  Defending bagels is the best thing since apparently sliced bread.
[04:39.580 --> 04:41.100]  And you don't remember anything about it?
[04:41.520 --> 04:45.360]  No, I just am trying to remember the specifics of the what the it was a garlic
[04:45.360 --> 04:51.160]  pepper cream cheese and then like a bacon scallion cream cheese mix.
[04:51.180 --> 04:54.640]  It was those two mixed on a cheddar bagel.
[04:54.700 --> 04:58.940]  I think for me, it's the toughness that you can't just bite through a bagel.
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.480]  You have to always give it a bit of tear.
[05:00.680 --> 05:03.980]  You need it to be a little bit draggy of the teeth.
[05:04.480 --> 05:06.640]  Interesting. Maybe that's what drags the whole experience down.
[05:06.820 --> 05:08.560]  I understand. I get that.
[05:08.700 --> 05:09.640]  I definitely get that.
[05:09.780 --> 05:13.760]  And and I sort of understand what you're saying on a whole about
[05:14.340 --> 05:16.060]  being done with something, whatever.
[05:16.520 --> 05:20.280]  It's just that when you're like, yeah, I'm like getting like seven out of ten
[05:20.280 --> 05:23.020]  pretty consistently and to like throw it out.
[05:23.840 --> 05:27.540]  Is really strange to me, like seven out of ten,
[05:27.700 --> 05:30.960]  seven out of ten is a pretty good score to be like,
[05:31.020 --> 05:33.980]  and I'm fucking done with it forever.
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.300]  Dude, just throwing out my expectations as opposed to throwing out the entire bagel.
[05:38.400 --> 05:40.020]  I think I've done with them for a while, definitely.
[05:40.340 --> 05:43.300]  But I just I'm always at the end of the bagel.
[05:43.300 --> 05:45.280]  Just like, yeah, all right.
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.960]  Whereas other things have a greater range,
[05:49.000 --> 05:52.220]  like a BLT, a BLT could be a five or it could be a ten.
[05:52.880 --> 05:54.960]  What kind of BLT is a five?
[05:55.100 --> 05:58.000]  I feel like a BLT, a bad BLT is like a nine.
[05:58.500 --> 06:03.520]  Mainly like from Thundercloud when they forget to put the B in
[06:03.520 --> 06:05.880]  or they're too high and they make the wrong thing.
[06:05.960 --> 06:08.260]  Gotcha. Well, it's just like I mean, loaded with salt.
[06:09.100 --> 06:12.680]  If you're shopping at Thundercloud, the prerequisite to work
[06:12.680 --> 06:14.080]  there is that you're too high.
[06:14.180 --> 06:18.240]  So you got to know going in that you're probably going to get somebody else's sandwich.
[06:18.440 --> 06:22.120]  Like I understand that they're all high, but sometimes they can barely comprehend.
[06:22.740 --> 06:24.060]  Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.520]  It's kind of like a part of its charm, though.
[06:27.800 --> 06:30.900]  I had a BLT once and I got I got lettuce and mustard.
[06:31.780 --> 06:32.720]  Oh, that's great.
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.320]  Whoa. That's an LM.
[06:35.680 --> 06:36.900]  That's crazy. An LM.
[06:39.000 --> 06:40.560]  Wait, you got a BLM?
[06:42.680 --> 06:43.920]  A bacon, lettuce, mustard?
[06:44.520 --> 06:49.300]  Do you ever mix it up with your you're like a plane with like low fat cream cheese?
[06:49.360 --> 06:52.600]  Whatever. Do you ever mix up the kind of bagel or the kind of cream cheese you get
[06:52.600 --> 06:56.100]  just to see if like there's something else there for you?
[06:56.760 --> 07:00.720]  I just need to I feel like I only ever get I've only ever had like a plane
[07:00.720 --> 07:02.380]  and then I ventured out into everything.
[07:02.500 --> 07:03.580]  That was just too much for me.
[07:03.720 --> 07:04.780]  And I've not really got in between.
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.200]  So you're at zero or one hundred and that's it?
[07:09.420 --> 07:11.220]  And I thought that would help me hone in.
[07:11.220 --> 07:13.020]  But it turns out when you just start with everything,
[07:13.060 --> 07:14.800]  I don't know which parts of it I don't like.
[07:14.980 --> 07:16.500]  I mean, a garlic bagel is good.
[07:16.600 --> 07:18.000]  I like a salt bagel.
[07:19.020 --> 07:20.100]  Like when you do.
[07:20.220 --> 07:21.380]  I think it nervous Charlie's.
[07:21.480 --> 07:24.340]  I like their sun dried tomato one and their jalapeno cheddar.
[07:24.600 --> 07:25.700]  Oh, those are really good.
[07:26.160 --> 07:28.780]  Jalapeno cheddar bagel is the best bagel, I think.
[07:28.820 --> 07:30.240]  I think it's I think it's really good.
[07:30.320 --> 07:35.380]  But can you name a format where a sun dried tomato is better than a regular wet one?
[07:35.740 --> 07:39.760]  Yeah. On a on a bagel on the top of it where it's baked in.
[07:41.360 --> 07:46.020]  Hmm. Yeah, that was any any other questions?
[07:47.460 --> 07:49.340]  Good answer. Yeah. OK, cool.
[07:50.080 --> 07:52.200]  I just I think that you have.
[07:52.860 --> 07:56.700]  I think if seven out of ten is the thing that you're throwing out for,
[07:56.780 --> 08:01.100]  I just think you need to do more research on what you like in a bagel.
[08:01.180 --> 08:04.020]  But I understand the thing that you're saying that you don't like.
[08:04.060 --> 08:08.280]  I completely understand the amount of chew and tear that you need to like bite
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.160]  hard and rip through for like a sandwich.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.240]  I agree with that.
[08:11.300 --> 08:13.840]  I feel like British food is all about chew and tear.
[08:15.060 --> 08:19.260]  Go on. I just when I think of British food in my head, it's very chewy.
[08:19.400 --> 08:21.920]  It's very tear. Which food?
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.780]  All of it. Just in my head.
[08:23.800 --> 08:24.840]  All you're talking about.
[08:25.180 --> 08:26.700]  You're all with the opinions today.
[08:27.100 --> 08:29.540]  You've got no sources and all opinions today.
[08:29.820 --> 08:30.640]  What do you mean?
[08:31.040 --> 08:34.880]  You're coming in trying to retire bagels for being a seven out of ten.
[08:35.260 --> 08:36.920]  What's your what's your bagel loadout?
[08:36.920 --> 08:37.800]  Don't remember.
[08:38.280 --> 08:40.400]  What food is chewy? All of it.
[08:41.620 --> 08:45.820]  Well, of the stuff we ate with the cookies, those cookies,
[08:46.020 --> 08:49.900]  there's some fucking hard chew cookies when we did the advent stuff.
[08:50.560 --> 08:52.520]  Well, they're probably all this shit, right?
[08:52.640 --> 08:53.400]  No, they weren't.
[08:54.620 --> 08:55.900]  Only the chips were expired.
[08:57.800 --> 08:59.820]  Yeah, I know your pain on that one, buddy.
[09:00.240 --> 09:01.040]  Gavin, can I say something?
[09:01.060 --> 09:02.480]  Can I say something in your defense?
[09:02.480 --> 09:07.820]  Yeah. As a man who has endeavored to never eat another corndog
[09:07.820 --> 09:12.240]  as long as he's as long as he lives and he's a good five years down that road
[09:12.240 --> 09:14.480]  at this point, I would say, and happier because of it.
[09:14.680 --> 09:18.520]  I support you ending a bageling in your life
[09:18.520 --> 09:21.560]  because even if there's a better bagel out there
[09:21.560 --> 09:25.440]  and there's always going to be a better bagel, no matter how good of a bagel
[09:25.440 --> 09:28.120]  you find, there's always a better bagel to chase.
[09:28.420 --> 09:30.040]  That's just the way the world works.
[09:30.040 --> 09:33.440]  But if you're consistently getting seven out of tens and that's disappointing
[09:33.440 --> 09:38.600]  to you, then shoo those bagels, replace them with a breakfast taco
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.820]  or a kolache or fucking oatmeal or whatever other breakfast food
[09:43.820 --> 09:46.780]  you want to have and bring yourself up to an eight or nine every day.
[09:46.840 --> 09:48.840]  Don't listen to these other guys that are telling you
[09:48.840 --> 09:50.900]  you got to eat sevens the rest of your life and you should be happy
[09:50.900 --> 09:51.680]  with a fucking seven.
[09:52.020 --> 09:53.360]  You don't need to do that.
[09:53.620 --> 09:54.920]  Just life is short.
[09:55.320 --> 09:58.220]  Your life is very short, Gavin.
[09:58.220 --> 10:03.040]  You need to enjoy your taste buds as much as you possibly can
[10:03.040 --> 10:04.100]  over the next few years.
[10:04.660 --> 10:07.400]  I appreciate the very sinister defense that you ended with there.
[10:07.680 --> 10:07.800]  Absolutely.
[10:08.140 --> 10:11.620]  I feel like this podcast is a nice, safe space to be announcing our retirement
[10:11.620 --> 10:12.700]  from certain food.
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.500]  I feel like some people have done it.
[10:14.600 --> 10:16.220]  Sure. I'm just thrown in.
[10:16.340 --> 10:19.300]  I just it was I think for me, it was two things.
[10:19.360 --> 10:21.140]  It was one. That's a high scale.
[10:21.540 --> 10:23.920]  I think if you would have just said, I'm a big toast guy now,
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.140]  it would have been less jarring to me than retiring bagels on a high end scale.
[10:28.220 --> 10:31.560]  And also the other thing of you trying to score higher,
[10:31.700 --> 10:35.220]  like being worried about being above a seven coming from the guy
[10:35.220 --> 10:38.860]  that if he could, would just eat a flavorless nutrient cube every day.
[10:39.280 --> 10:41.640]  Like, it's just it's hard.
[10:42.060 --> 10:45.220]  Like this pursuit of more than seven in the food realm.
[10:45.260 --> 10:47.780]  Just it feels like a thing you don't care about.
[10:47.960 --> 10:50.500]  Generally, such a good point.
[10:51.840 --> 10:53.900]  Just any food opinions by you.
[10:53.920 --> 10:55.480]  I'm kind of rattled by it.
[10:55.480 --> 10:57.380]  Yeah, especially is it a flake?
[10:57.380 --> 10:59.180]  So it's like not the flavor thing.
[10:59.420 --> 11:01.800]  It's just like it's the chew of it.
[11:01.960 --> 11:04.660]  Like you like the flavor of the bagel.
[11:06.540 --> 11:07.260]  Who, me?
[11:07.760 --> 11:08.960]  Who the f**k?
[11:11.160 --> 11:12.500]  Hey, you know what?
[11:12.580 --> 11:15.380]  Just edit my s**t out. Who cares?
[11:16.760 --> 11:19.240]  Because it sounded like you're really excited about toast.
[11:20.760 --> 11:24.460]  That's just an example of like, there's a greater range for me with toast.
[11:24.940 --> 11:25.320]  Like what?
[11:28.500 --> 11:30.820]  He hits toast home runs from time to time.
[11:30.920 --> 11:33.280]  He gets ten toasts, but he never gets a ten bagel.
[11:33.540 --> 11:33.900]  I get that.
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.820]  This is really along the same lines as I just think apples are a six out of ten
[11:37.820 --> 11:39.700]  in general, and the ceiling is low.
[11:39.940 --> 11:40.800]  This is targeting now.
[11:41.060 --> 11:41.760]  Now this is targeting.
[11:42.120 --> 11:43.560]  Do you guys think I have a question for you?
[11:43.640 --> 11:46.460]  Gavin says bagels are a seven out of ten, and that seems to be acceptable
[11:46.460 --> 11:47.140]  for some of you.
[11:47.740 --> 11:50.760]  Do you think that the scale changes for time of day?
[11:51.080 --> 11:54.720]  Like, do you think it's more acceptable to have a seven out of ten for lunch
[11:54.720 --> 11:56.420]  than it is for breakfast or for dinner?
[11:56.420 --> 12:00.560]  Because I feel like if you're going to have an eight or a nine or a ten out of ten,
[12:00.700 --> 12:02.000]  it needs to be a breakfast.
[12:02.280 --> 12:02.860]  Oh, really?
[12:02.880 --> 12:04.940]  I was going to say dinner should be the highest ranking of the day.
[12:05.200 --> 12:06.180]  Dinner's the highest ranking.
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.100]  I feel like breakfast is the fuel that carries me through the day.
[12:10.540 --> 12:13.420]  And if I start bad, then I'm going to have a bad day.
[12:13.480 --> 12:15.640]  But if I start strong, I finish strong.
[12:16.060 --> 12:17.080]  It definitely sets off the day.
[12:17.120 --> 12:18.820]  But I feel like dinner is where the money's spent.
[12:18.980 --> 12:20.460]  Those are the more expensive meals.
[12:20.580 --> 12:21.800]  They take the longest to make.
[12:22.300 --> 12:22.940]  I'm with Gavin.
[12:23.440 --> 12:25.920]  And dinner is when I tend to look up and I'm like,
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.180]  Oh, fuck, Emily comes home in an hour and we don't have anything.
[12:28.340 --> 12:32.140]  I got to throw some pasta together, a fucking order a pizza or whatever.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.080]  And it's always like...
[12:34.720 --> 12:36.500]  I can't imagine a dinner bagel.
[12:36.800 --> 12:37.820]  That's wild to me.
[12:37.900 --> 12:38.680]  Oh, interesting.
[12:38.880 --> 12:40.320]  I bet there would be potato on it somewhere.
[12:41.420 --> 12:42.560]  Oh, a potagle?
[12:43.980 --> 12:44.600]  Come on.
[12:44.720 --> 12:45.600]  Potagles are great, man.
[12:45.860 --> 12:47.020]  Potagles are fucking awesome.
[12:47.380 --> 12:47.460]  Yeah.
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.600]  You know, when when a rocket goes into space and like it shoots up
[12:51.600 --> 12:54.580]  and then it drops the thrusters or whatever to like continue going,
[12:54.580 --> 12:55.920]  like it drops whatever.
[12:56.100 --> 13:00.000]  I don't know how fucking rockets work, but they use thrusters and they drop it.
[13:00.080 --> 13:01.680]  Jettisons its boosters and all that.
[13:01.940 --> 13:04.740]  Yeah, that's what the bagel is to the day to me.
[13:05.080 --> 13:06.540]  Like it's you don't need that.
[13:06.660 --> 13:08.020]  You need that to get going.
[13:08.440 --> 13:09.600]  That's not a later thing.
[13:10.120 --> 13:11.020]  You have it.
[13:11.500 --> 13:14.180]  It propels you forward and then you just move on.
[13:14.320 --> 13:16.520]  I also feel like if you have a shitty dinner, you're like,
[13:16.580 --> 13:19.620]  I'll just make up for it on dessert, you know, or whatever.
[13:19.860 --> 13:21.960]  Whereas if I have a shitty breakfast, I'm already full.
[13:22.000 --> 13:22.960]  I don't want to eat anymore.
[13:22.960 --> 13:25.100]  I got to wait hours till it's lunchtime.
[13:25.320 --> 13:31.040]  Yesterday, I went for I treated myself to coffee and tacos at at Desnudo.
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.000]  I sent you that photo of the little campfire at Desnudo, which was fucking cool
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.060]  on a cold all coffee shops should have an outdoor campfire.
[13:37.160 --> 13:40.000]  So you feel like you're fucking making s'mores while you're drinking your coffee.
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.140]  But I had I had two tacos from Veracruz,
[13:45.240 --> 13:47.800]  which is the best taco truck in Austin.
[13:47.960 --> 13:50.580]  And they were both seven out of ten.
[13:50.580 --> 13:54.580]  And I was so fucking bummed out for the entire rest of the day
[13:54.580 --> 13:58.020]  that this morning I I always get my tacos from Veracruz.
[13:58.140 --> 14:00.560]  I was like, I can't do it today. I had to go somewhere else.
[14:05.480 --> 14:08.000]  Now. Sorry, I'm back on the range thing just for a minute.
[14:08.020 --> 14:09.960]  I'm still trying to process this range.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.400]  You want lower and higher.
[14:12.500 --> 14:16.180]  Is that the thing, the risk of low is worth it for you to go above a seven?
[14:16.800 --> 14:17.960]  I just don't like a low ceiling.
[14:18.640 --> 14:21.000]  I don't want my range is trapped between one and seven.
[14:21.260 --> 14:25.320]  Low. OK, I just we have a different definition of ceiling, I guess, for low ceiling.
[14:25.540 --> 14:27.060]  What's your definition of the ceiling?
[14:27.640 --> 14:29.320]  A low ceiling to me is a five.
[14:29.960 --> 14:32.140]  Oh, like just how? OK. Yeah.
[14:32.520 --> 14:37.960]  If the ceiling is five, there's no like I would never find it.
[14:38.140 --> 14:40.580]  Like, how would you even get to the floor?
[14:41.560 --> 14:43.040]  Well, the floor is to discover the five.
[14:43.140 --> 14:45.140]  I mean, like a five on my radar.
[14:45.900 --> 14:47.060]  If you try a new food.
[14:47.800 --> 14:49.660]  That's where you find in your your ceiling.
[14:49.840 --> 14:52.880]  You're like, if if you have like a food that people are excited about,
[14:53.300 --> 14:54.360]  you're like, I don't know.
[14:54.620 --> 14:56.280]  I didn't connect for me. That was like three.
[14:56.800 --> 14:59.380]  But you give it another try and maybe you hit a five.
[14:59.460 --> 15:00.820]  Like that's to me when you retire food.
[15:02.180 --> 15:03.160]  So your cutoff is five?
[15:03.820 --> 15:05.680]  I think so. Yeah, I think I would stop.
[15:05.860 --> 15:09.020]  I'd be willing to retire something if it was consistently a five.
[15:09.320 --> 15:11.360]  I understand that. And I would retire something at five.
[15:11.460 --> 15:15.080]  I was more surprised that I can't find above a seven
[15:15.080 --> 15:18.360]  and I'm therefore going to have to retire at seven, which is quite high to retire.
[15:18.500 --> 15:19.340]  That is wild.
[15:19.940 --> 15:21.220]  I think we could find you a better bagel.
[15:21.360 --> 15:22.900]  I really don't think it's that high to retire.
[15:23.320 --> 15:26.400]  I think if we go deep in the bagel depth chart, we can find you an eight.
[15:27.100 --> 15:28.600]  I'll bet. I'm willing to try.
[15:28.760 --> 15:31.440]  And I'll get I'll get back in the bagel ring in the ring.
[15:32.040 --> 15:34.460]  I think your best shot in town is by Biedermann's
[15:34.460 --> 15:37.700]  over on the north, up north, far west somewhere.
[15:38.580 --> 15:40.480]  Group trip? Yeah. Yeah.
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.000]  I'll go get some pastrami.
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.300]  I feel like, Andrew, you'd have to go to your new favorite bagel place.
[15:47.680 --> 15:48.700]  I don't have one. On your island.
[15:49.140 --> 15:53.580]  Oh no. I really appreciate Nick immediately pushing for the food road trip.
[15:54.260 --> 15:56.440]  Oh, of course. That's that's his heart and soul.
[15:56.540 --> 15:58.400]  That's his blood. Yeah, that's yeah.
[15:58.460 --> 15:59.300]  That's what he wants.
[15:59.600 --> 16:02.340]  Well, maybe we could do that the same day we construct our potagel
[16:02.340 --> 16:03.660]  and make a dinner bagel.
[16:04.340 --> 16:07.880]  Oh, yeah. A smashed potagel.
[16:08.380 --> 16:10.440]  That's what I'm thinking. Or a baked potagel.
[16:11.100 --> 16:12.200]  Potatoes needs a sequel.
[16:12.980 --> 16:15.780]  Maybe Nick can do the red boots that day.
[16:16.100 --> 16:18.000]  Really build like a...
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.800]  The mall and the bagel shop are on opposite sides of town, unfortunately.
[16:24.480 --> 16:27.540]  Geoff, when we went and got hot dogs the other day,
[16:27.660 --> 16:29.660]  you confessed to me and Nick that you were really sad
[16:29.660 --> 16:31.960]  that we didn't talk about potato stuff on the last episode.
[16:33.260 --> 16:34.440]  Oh, I did.
[16:34.540 --> 16:37.180]  But I deleted all my potato notes after we had that conversation.
[16:37.180 --> 16:40.340]  Why? What? I just teed you up.
[16:40.840 --> 16:43.140]  Because you convinced me we'd already talked about it.
[16:43.220 --> 16:44.200]  You said it sounded familiar.
[16:44.360 --> 16:45.780]  And I thought, oh, I must have just remembered it wrong.
[16:45.820 --> 16:46.500]  So I deleted it all.
[16:47.060 --> 16:48.140]  Why? Why? Why delete?
[16:49.520 --> 16:51.100]  Uh, you're right. I probably shouldn't have.
[16:51.140 --> 16:53.280]  I was just cleaning up my notes today and I thought, don't need those.
[16:53.420 --> 16:56.200]  It wasn't a wasn't like it was a seven out of ten.
[16:56.300 --> 16:57.640]  So I've retired it.
[17:01.900 --> 17:04.000]  It was just a couple of potato recipes.
[17:04.280 --> 17:05.720]  I don't remember what they were, though.
[17:05.720 --> 17:06.800]  I would have loved to have heard.
[17:07.060 --> 17:10.220]  Do you think we do you think this is a seven out of ten episode
[17:10.220 --> 17:11.840]  that people are listening to right now?
[17:12.020 --> 17:14.480]  Like this might like this might be like our low ceiling.
[17:14.860 --> 17:16.900]  Please don't retire us from your listening.
[17:17.920 --> 17:20.160]  Give give your ears one more chance.
[17:20.660 --> 17:21.780]  I mean, we're only 20 minutes in.
[17:21.860 --> 17:23.200]  It could go up or down from here.
[17:23.540 --> 17:23.880]  That's true.
[17:25.920 --> 17:26.960]  Things are cozy.

[17:31.960 --> 17:34.140]  And to make things even more exciting.

[20:04.080 --> 20:07.340]  On the topic of food, I had a morning thought that was food related.
[20:08.260 --> 20:10.360]  Where do popcorn seeds come from?
[20:11.840 --> 20:13.520]  Like a maze? What?
[20:13.640 --> 20:15.380]  What? What? I still don't know. What?
[20:15.500 --> 20:16.540]  What are you?
[20:17.720 --> 20:19.220]  What are you saying?
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.760]  You're not being you're not being honest with us right now.
[20:21.880 --> 20:24.040]  No. What's happening?
[20:24.440 --> 20:30.000]  You're not being you're not being truthful when you say that to us right now.
[20:30.100 --> 20:31.900]  No, no, no. Let me let me fully explain this to you.
[20:32.060 --> 20:33.720]  Let me talk to you through my thought process.
[20:34.060 --> 20:35.540]  I woke up.
[20:35.700 --> 20:39.260]  I thought because I was I had a stomachache yesterday.
[20:39.340 --> 20:42.660]  Is it related to the fact I ate like a one pound bag of popcorn?
[20:42.800 --> 20:44.160]  Who can say? I don't know.
[20:44.760 --> 20:48.240]  But I was thinking about how much popcorn I ate.
[20:48.240 --> 20:51.980]  And could I equate that to a single thing of corn on the cob?
[20:52.520 --> 20:55.900]  Like if I were to translate each little little thing, each little
[20:55.900 --> 20:58.560]  if I imagine each little I don't even know what to call it.
[20:58.600 --> 21:02.360]  Nugget, corn nugget, kernel, kernel. OK.
[21:04.220 --> 21:06.700]  If I converted that kernel to kernel,
[21:08.200 --> 21:11.340]  how many kernels are in a cob and then how many in relation?
[21:11.500 --> 21:12.300]  Because you just don't have a number.
[21:12.640 --> 21:14.720]  And then it got me thinking about popcorn seeds.
[21:14.800 --> 21:17.540]  And I've never I've been to corn maze
[21:17.540 --> 21:19.140]  and I've never seen seeds.
[21:19.280 --> 21:22.180]  Why do you keep saying what's going on?
[21:22.540 --> 21:24.120]  What's going on?
[21:25.560 --> 21:30.540]  A large bag of popcorn would be it would have about 29 ears of corn in it.
[21:30.580 --> 21:31.800]  Yeah. Are you serious?
[21:32.320 --> 21:36.360]  Eight hundred kernels on sixteen rows on an ear of corn
[21:36.360 --> 21:38.520]  varies between five hundred to twelve hundred.
[21:39.080 --> 21:41.320]  Yeah, that's just one to one.
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.100]  I don't know. What are you talking?
[21:43.100 --> 21:47.520]  What? OK, so yesterday you ate 30 ears of corn.
[21:48.160 --> 21:49.780]  Way more than that, dude.
[21:49.880 --> 21:52.180]  I probably took down a field. It was insane.
[21:52.440 --> 21:53.540]  Why did you eat so much popcorn?
[21:54.040 --> 21:58.760]  I bought this extra large bag from a place and I just was a salt maniac.
[21:59.000 --> 21:59.760]  I just couldn't stop.
[22:00.860 --> 22:01.940]  I love it.
[22:02.720 --> 22:03.640]  Can't get enough.
[22:04.140 --> 22:06.120]  That's like when you when you live in Texas for a while
[22:06.120 --> 22:10.680]  and you're eating tortilla chips constantly at every as a fucking free appetizer
[22:10.680 --> 22:12.180]  at every restaurant in town.
[22:12.180 --> 22:16.060]  And you just like howls and bag like container after container of chip.
[22:16.140 --> 22:18.800]  And then somebody goes, you know what tortilla chips are, right?
[22:18.800 --> 22:19.980]  They're just tortillas.
[22:20.180 --> 22:22.520]  And you're like, I just ate 86 tortillas.
[22:23.200 --> 22:23.940]  That's crazy.
[22:24.300 --> 22:27.360]  Yeah. Do you have you ever eaten just a whole cup of corn there?
[22:27.780 --> 22:28.880]  Yeah, of course. Yeah.
[22:29.140 --> 22:30.440]  It's not hard. So.
[22:31.500 --> 22:33.260]  Like, you know, a tenth of a bag of popcorn.
[22:33.580 --> 22:35.780]  That's crazy. You ate all those popcorn seeds.
[22:35.980 --> 22:36.700]  That's nuts.
[22:37.300 --> 22:38.700]  Well, is that where the seeds come from?
[22:38.700 --> 22:40.340]  Like the seeds.
[22:41.480 --> 22:42.700]  Are they not seeds?
[22:44.760 --> 22:48.000]  OK, well, how do you grow corn?
[22:49.680 --> 22:50.680]  I have to.
[22:50.980 --> 22:53.640]  I want I don't know that I've ever wanted to quit the show.
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  This might be the first.
[22:55.300 --> 22:57.200]  This is absolutely nuts.
[22:57.400 --> 22:58.580]  You can't be for real.
[22:58.980 --> 23:00.000]  Well, there goes the seven
[23:01.800 --> 23:02.440]  now, right?
[23:03.200 --> 23:04.480]  Are we listen?
[23:04.580 --> 23:06.640]  I didn't know we're fucking all agriculture experts.
[23:07.620 --> 23:09.460]  I've I've walked through a corn maze.
[23:09.560 --> 23:10.700]  I've eaten plenty of corn
[23:12.160 --> 23:13.640]  maze, as some call it.
[23:13.680 --> 23:16.080]  If we want to get fancy, we want to get in the culinary term.
[23:17.040 --> 23:18.200]  How do you grow it?
[23:18.660 --> 23:20.740]  What are you talking about?
[23:21.200 --> 23:22.340]  Ground? What?
[23:22.940 --> 23:23.600]  What do you mean?
[23:24.000 --> 23:24.760]  What's the sort?
[23:24.900 --> 23:27.740]  OK, so if I'm going to get a if I'm going to.
[23:27.940 --> 23:29.160]  OK, let me let me.
[23:29.240 --> 23:30.400]  I see where you're coming from now.
[23:30.560 --> 23:36.440]  If I'm going to grow a let's say like a tree, I need a seed.
[23:36.640 --> 23:37.200]  To do it.
[23:37.620 --> 23:38.900]  What is the base?
[23:39.540 --> 23:40.980]  Where does what's the base corn?
[23:41.020 --> 23:42.320]  What does corn grow from?
[23:43.580 --> 23:45.780]  Like it's like the sapling stage.
[23:47.220 --> 23:48.700]  Yeah, like there's a field.
[23:48.900 --> 23:51.380]  OK, I decide I want to be a corn farmer.
[23:51.880 --> 23:53.680]  I get my I got my my dirt.
[23:53.980 --> 23:57.220]  I got all my dirt and then I prepare it for things to grow in it.
[23:57.520 --> 23:58.800]  What am I putting in the ground?
[23:59.180 --> 24:00.080]  You want me to show you?
[24:00.680 --> 24:00.980]  Yes.
[24:02.480 --> 24:04.900]  OK, that's what I was curious about.
[24:04.900 --> 24:09.340]  Is that so the kernels are where you grow corn from?
[24:10.020 --> 24:13.820]  Each kernel of corn is actually a seed that, like most seeds,
[24:13.920 --> 24:17.040]  contains an embryo and a seed coat for protection.
[24:18.540 --> 24:20.560]  Interesting, but not that interesting.
[24:21.100 --> 24:22.120]  No, not that name.
[24:22.140 --> 24:28.440]  Another food where you just purely eat the thing that that creates more of beans.
[24:28.800 --> 24:33.940]  Oh, shit. OK, you got there a lot faster than I thought you would.
[24:35.080 --> 24:37.140]  I don't, I don't, this is...
[24:38.920 --> 24:41.300]  Beans? I'm not going to do it, this is a six out of ten.
[24:42.980 --> 24:45.800]  I just I never thought of it because I've been to a corn mate.
[24:45.880 --> 24:48.080]  I've never seen just that.
[24:48.900 --> 24:52.100]  So is if with enough time, does it just turn?
[24:52.240 --> 24:53.460]  Does the kernel just become that?
[24:55.660 --> 24:57.540]  Or is there a process that we do?
[24:58.640 --> 25:02.180]  I don't even. Are you asking if corn comes from corn?
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.460]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:04.460 --> 25:10.420]  So the corn at the grocery store, I throw in a pot, I then eat it.
[25:10.420 --> 25:15.480]  If I just were to leave that corn alone at what does it become a kernel?
[25:15.600 --> 25:16.800]  Eventually, does it like harden?
[25:17.160 --> 25:18.240]  Not exactly.
[25:19.520 --> 25:23.220]  Popcorn corn, I think, is genetically altered.
[25:23.820 --> 25:25.500]  So it probably doesn't grow.
[25:25.540 --> 25:27.140]  But but originally, yeah.
[25:27.140 --> 25:29.460]  Before science got involved. Yeah. OK.
[25:29.460 --> 25:32.520]  So I couldn't like buy a corn.
[25:32.760 --> 25:35.980]  I don't then create my own popcorn, essentially, with enough time.
[25:36.240 --> 25:38.420]  No, I think you probably could that way. Really?
[25:38.600 --> 25:39.660]  You could do it that way.
[25:39.740 --> 25:42.800]  I just don't think you could buy Orville Redenbacher unpopped
[25:42.800 --> 25:46.540]  microwave popcorn, take that corn and plant it in the ground and receive.
[25:47.040 --> 25:48.200]  Oh, yeah. Corn.
[25:48.300 --> 25:49.540]  Now that I want to try.
[25:50.120 --> 25:50.880]  That would be great.
[25:51.200 --> 25:53.120]  Like genetically, I don't think that can happen.
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.640]  But the other way around, I think would. Yeah. OK.
[25:57.260 --> 26:01.300]  I just had never seen a kernel like a loose kernel in the field.
[26:01.660 --> 26:05.020]  I went to a lot of corn mazes as a kid, and I just never encountered it.
[26:05.100 --> 26:06.960]  And I just I figured I'd get an answer here.
[26:07.120 --> 26:08.800]  That one critical piece to the puzzle.
[26:09.280 --> 26:11.680]  Are you saying maze like like a maze you walk in?
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.580]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[26:14.160 --> 26:15.220]  Yeah. Like a holiday.
[26:15.500 --> 26:19.040]  It was typically October ish spooky corn mazes.
[26:19.860 --> 26:22.020]  This continent loves corn.
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.220]  That's my probably going to be my biggest takeaway.
[26:24.420 --> 26:26.000]  Oh, everything's corn. Yeah.
[26:26.480 --> 26:28.000]  It's like 95 percent.
[26:28.220 --> 26:29.640]  It's like it's like from here.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.700]  This is like it's what corn corn comes from here.
[26:33.800 --> 26:35.860]  It's like the first thing that we did. Yeah.
[26:36.500 --> 26:40.080]  Like that's why it's a thing over here and not over there
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.960]  because it's from over here and not from over there.
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.680]  There's no European corn.
[26:44.860 --> 26:48.580]  I believe that corn originated in Mesoamerica
[26:48.580 --> 26:50.820]  and then moved like was taken to Europe.
[26:51.260 --> 26:53.500]  I mean, we don't have raccoons either. We're missing out.
[26:56.000 --> 26:57.140]  You have raccoons in Europe?
[26:57.460 --> 27:01.160]  Your two biggest regrets are raccoons and corn.
[27:03.880 --> 27:06.120]  You guys also don't really have peanut butter, do you?
[27:06.880 --> 27:08.660]  Oh, really? Yeah, we don't.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.080]  Yeah, that's not a thing over there.
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.020]  I think it's weird. It's not a thing.
[27:11.160 --> 27:12.560]  Yeah. Yeah. Peanut butter is everywhere.
[27:12.660 --> 27:13.560]  We just don't have it with chocolate.
[27:14.240 --> 27:14.860]  What? Really?
[27:15.180 --> 27:17.640]  But but you guys don't have like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, right?
[27:19.380 --> 27:20.780]  Uh, well, OK.
[27:20.920 --> 27:24.660]  What is what is the default jelly flavor?
[27:25.440 --> 27:27.080]  Strawberry, grape and grape.
[27:27.360 --> 27:29.060]  Strawberry and grape, I'd say it's 50-50.
[27:29.420 --> 27:31.320]  Meg was saying it was grape first.
[27:31.780 --> 27:34.200]  Yeah, it's grape first. It's grape first.
[27:34.380 --> 27:37.180]  But what what England is very lacking is the grape flavor.
[27:37.340 --> 27:39.260]  I don't find grape flavored anything.
[27:40.320 --> 27:41.480]  Sucks. It does suck.
[27:41.520 --> 27:42.640]  Really? Disgraceful.
[27:42.900 --> 27:45.800]  It doesn't suck, but it's a lower tier flavor.
[27:46.080 --> 27:48.940]  I disagree. I think it's I think it's a better flavor than strawberry.
[27:49.600 --> 27:52.020]  Doesn't doesn't taste like grapes, though.
[27:52.800 --> 27:54.160]  Grape jelly is pretty good.
[27:54.460 --> 27:57.760]  I don't know if it's better than strawberry jelly. Pretty good.
[27:58.420 --> 28:00.960]  I think if you got grape jelly, the raccoons would show up.
[28:02.060 --> 28:03.720]  Oh, do you think one follows the other?
[28:03.880 --> 28:05.240]  Didn't even think about that. Smart.
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.540]  If I plant a jar of grape jelly.
[28:10.780 --> 28:12.980]  Where do the grape seeds come from?
[28:14.260 --> 28:15.160]  Build it and they will come.
[28:16.180 --> 28:17.380]  You gotta get all those raccoons.
[28:18.460 --> 28:20.100]  And give them your bagels that you don't want.
[28:21.060 --> 28:23.940]  Erica, did you was it you that posted there's a raccoon?
[28:26.180 --> 28:27.280]  In. Chicken horse?
[28:28.120 --> 28:29.620]  What? What?
[28:29.920 --> 28:31.640]  The new game? Is that what you're saying?
[28:32.620 --> 28:34.780]  Are you talking about the new game, the racing game?
[28:34.860 --> 28:37.560]  Because there is a raccoon and chicken horse, but there always has been.
[28:37.600 --> 28:38.000]  I don't know.
[28:38.400 --> 28:41.800]  We're trying to parse what you're what you said, and you're not responding to any of it.
[28:41.900 --> 28:44.320]  So what you're posting was like a trailer for a new game?
[28:44.880 --> 28:48.440]  Yeah, it's called Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, I think, or something like that.
[28:48.440 --> 28:54.020]  And it is it's ultimate chicken horse, but like on little vehicles.
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.420]  And it looks difficult.
[28:56.780 --> 29:00.240]  It's like a side scroller for make way, which I guess you didn't play.
[29:00.520 --> 29:01.620]  No, I've never played that.
[29:01.760 --> 29:02.560]  He hasn't played it yet.
[29:02.640 --> 29:04.020]  But yeah, because you posted that.
[29:04.080 --> 29:06.420]  I was like, I hadn't watched it, but I was like, I'm pretty sure
[29:06.420 --> 29:07.860]  there was already a raccoon in that game.
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.760]  Well, no, it's the game is called Ultimate Sheep Raccoon.
[29:11.880 --> 29:13.080]  Yeah, I understand now.
[29:13.240 --> 29:14.100]  I was just clarifying.
[29:14.720 --> 29:16.380]  Yeah, and so am I right now to you.
[29:17.220 --> 29:20.660]  It'd be like if Eric posted a trailer for the Master Chief collection.
[29:20.780 --> 29:23.060]  Guy was like, pretty sure Master Chief was already in this.
[29:25.180 --> 29:26.500]  I'm pretty sure he was already in there.
[29:26.660 --> 29:27.160]  Stay in this.
[29:28.740 --> 29:32.260]  Hey, do you know, since we're talking about corn and weird food things,
[29:32.420 --> 29:36.520]  I read on Reddit the other day, do you guys know what an individual M&M is called?
[29:37.860 --> 29:38.920]  Like they have a name.
[29:39.440 --> 29:40.380]  Really? Yeah.
[29:40.960 --> 29:41.520]  What are they?
[29:41.880 --> 29:45.320]  And apparently an individual form of spaghetti,
[29:45.320 --> 29:48.820]  the singular form of spaghetti, is a spaghetto, which I didn't know.
[29:49.180 --> 29:51.640]  But also M&M's, they're not M's.
[29:52.760 --> 29:56.840]  They're an individual M&M, according to the Mars Corporation,
[29:57.400 --> 30:00.140]  say they are officially referred to as lentils.
[30:01.100 --> 30:02.340]  Lentils? Yeah.
[30:02.640 --> 30:05.840]  So when you're eating M&M's, you're eating lentils, which is weird.
[30:05.900 --> 30:08.120]  Can I grow them if I bury them?
[30:08.560 --> 30:09.320]  I think genetically.
[30:09.880 --> 30:12.740]  I think if you buy M&M's, I'm not sure which way it works.
[30:14.940 --> 30:16.440]  Anyway, I thought that was real stupid.
[30:16.660 --> 30:17.720]  I thought I'd mention it. That is.
[30:17.900 --> 30:22.120]  Well, I think what originally happened was people thought that,
[30:22.600 --> 30:27.320]  and the thing that was spoken about a lot is that one Skittle,
[30:27.520 --> 30:31.460]  people said was called a lentil, and then the Skittle people said,
[30:31.620 --> 30:33.160]  no, one Skittle is a Skittles.
[30:33.560 --> 30:34.660]  They are always a Skittle.
[30:34.760 --> 30:36.980]  It's always Skittles, no matter how many there are.
[30:37.740 --> 30:41.700]  And then M&M came out and said, oh, yeah, one M&M is called a lentil.
[30:41.700 --> 30:43.220]  And everyone flipped out.
[30:43.800 --> 30:47.140]  Hey, while we're talking about food, I have another note
[30:47.140 --> 30:51.080]  I had written down here at Thanksgiving I meant to talk to you guys about.
[30:51.240 --> 30:54.520]  I think I have a way we can innovate on a popular food
[30:55.080 --> 30:57.080]  and we wouldn't be the first to do it.
[30:57.140 --> 31:00.180]  I'm not saying we have invented this, but I don't think it's popular.
[31:00.180 --> 31:02.940]  And I think we could popularize it and while doing so
[31:04.260 --> 31:06.300]  create some cool some cool flavors.
[31:07.060 --> 31:09.580]  When we were in Thanksgiving, we were looking for a place to eat.
[31:12.080 --> 31:15.940]  Emily's sister's kids were wanted to eat soup out of a bread bowl,
[31:16.100 --> 31:18.800]  which I remember being a really big deal for Millie when she was a kid.
[31:18.880 --> 31:21.700]  We would go to this restaurant that always had like tomato soup in a bread bowl.
[31:21.820 --> 31:23.000]  I know this is hard for you, Gav.
[31:23.200 --> 31:26.360]  Yeah, I apologize. But it's going to go drier, I promise. Thanks.
[31:27.340 --> 31:29.400]  And then when they were I just I got to thinking about it
[31:29.400 --> 31:31.260]  and they were joking around about other stuff to put in a bread bowl.
[31:31.260 --> 31:33.540]  And they said they wanted to eat spaghetti out of a bread bowl.
[31:33.540 --> 31:34.840]  And I thought that's kind of brilliant.
[31:34.860 --> 31:35.980]  So I started looking for it.
[31:36.140 --> 31:38.680]  And there are recipes for bread bowl spaghetti.
[31:38.680 --> 31:43.420]  But I've never been to a restaurant and been able to order spaghetti out of a
[31:43.420 --> 31:46.380]  think about it, a garlic bread bowl.
[31:48.020 --> 31:49.520]  How amazing would that be?
[31:49.840 --> 31:50.700]  That sounds awful.
[31:50.900 --> 31:52.140]  I think it sounds awesome.
[31:52.380 --> 31:53.580]  Nick thinks it sounds awesome.
[31:53.980 --> 31:55.780]  Garlic bread goes with spaghetti.
[31:56.560 --> 31:58.520]  You get it in its own bowl. It's in its own container.
[31:58.640 --> 32:00.560]  You get to eat the container. It's like a taco salad.
[32:00.960 --> 32:05.240]  Oh, Geoff. Oh, man.
[32:05.360 --> 32:07.060]  Yeah, there's a picture because they do exist.
[32:07.180 --> 32:08.340]  Like I said, I'm not inventing it.
[32:08.340 --> 32:11.340]  I think we can popularize it because I don't think it's popular.
[32:11.460 --> 32:12.840]  And I think it should and could be.
[32:13.280 --> 32:17.940]  I'm just in the I'm on the side of if spaghetti is not presented normally to me,
[32:17.940 --> 32:20.640]  it looks repulsive, but I don't want to feel the same way.
[32:20.700 --> 32:21.660]  Yes. Really?
[32:22.040 --> 32:23.680]  Well, I wouldn't want to eat either of that.
[32:23.740 --> 32:25.980]  I assume separately. I'm with you.
[32:26.200 --> 32:26.700]  Here, Gavin.
[32:26.880 --> 32:29.020]  Gavin, you're going to fucking hate this one.
[32:29.640 --> 32:31.600]  OK, well, you also keep in keep in mind.
[32:31.880 --> 32:34.980]  Gavin doesn't like wet bread and Eric doesn't like spaghetti.
[32:34.980 --> 32:38.640]  It's so this might not be for the both of you, but for the both of you.
[32:38.640 --> 32:40.160]  You don't like spaghetti on its own.
[32:40.160 --> 32:40.740]  I didn't know that.
[32:41.180 --> 32:41.960]  No, I don't like spaghetti.
[32:42.380 --> 32:43.100]  Holy shit.
[32:43.480 --> 32:45.380]  I think it's the worst form of pasta.
[32:45.800 --> 32:46.080]  Firstly.
[32:47.280 --> 32:48.840]  How dare you? Secondly, what?
[32:49.460 --> 32:51.000]  What don't you like about spaghetti?
[32:51.140 --> 32:52.360]  Just like a bowl of days.
[32:52.760 --> 32:55.580]  I just I just don't think it like compared to other pastas.
[32:55.600 --> 32:58.020]  I don't think it holds sauce as well.
[32:58.160 --> 33:01.700]  I just think it's insufficient at what it's trying to achieve.
[33:01.800 --> 33:04.280]  Even like a really, really good spaghetti
[33:04.280 --> 33:07.920]  just kind of pales in comparison to most other pastas, like a seven out of ten
[33:07.920 --> 33:10.980]  experience. No, it's like a four out of ten.
[33:11.060 --> 33:13.280]  The whole reason I know this show.
[33:13.420 --> 33:15.200]  Yeah, we have because I won.
[33:15.340 --> 33:17.600]  I won dinner one day and I made I picked spaghetti
[33:17.600 --> 33:20.660]  because I knew you didn't like it and you were fucking bummed out.
[33:21.060 --> 33:22.320]  I was. It's true.
[33:22.980 --> 33:24.940]  You've never gone above a four on spaghetti.
[33:25.340 --> 33:30.920]  Yeah, yeah. I just think it's it's a it's a subpar pasta for what it's like.
[33:30.920 --> 33:34.360]  I just think every other pasta like does the job better.
[33:34.540 --> 33:36.500]  I just feel like spaghetti is the first one.
[33:36.880 --> 33:39.260]  That's that's pasta number one. It's just the standard.
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.720]  Yeah. The the gateway.
[33:40.980 --> 33:43.000]  The vanilla ice cream of pastas.
[33:43.120 --> 33:43.840]  Vanilla ice cream.
[33:44.100 --> 33:45.620]  That'd be an interesting game, actually.
[33:45.720 --> 33:47.440]  Finding out the vanilla of each.
[33:47.880 --> 33:51.240]  Oh, that is so like, oh, that's such a good idea.
[33:51.360 --> 33:52.680]  What if we do a vanilla draft?
[33:53.180 --> 33:54.900]  Let's do it. All right. Vanilla draft.
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.540]  All right. Hang on. Hang on.
[33:56.540 --> 33:59.340]  I'm writing it down and maybe it doesn't have to be food.
[33:59.340 --> 34:05.440]  Maybe it could be just the first in the 101 of different things.
[34:05.500 --> 34:06.960]  It's the gateway, right?
[34:07.200 --> 34:08.380]  Yeah. The gateway food.
[34:08.620 --> 34:13.800]  I like that. Spaghetti in a bread bowl turns Eric and Gavin
[34:13.800 --> 34:16.340]  into like the Batman and Robin of hating a thing.
[34:16.420 --> 34:19.540]  Just united. It's interesting to take it down.
[34:20.200 --> 34:23.240]  It's not often just those two are united in an argument.
[34:23.340 --> 34:23.760]  It's interesting.
[34:24.720 --> 34:25.960]  That is a great point.
[34:26.300 --> 34:28.360]  It's like having a video with just Gavin and Nick.
[34:28.360 --> 34:31.940]  I want to see it so bad, but it's just not a combination you get.
[34:32.800 --> 34:33.540]  Oh, it's coming.
[34:34.040 --> 34:36.680]  I've done. We've done a Nick, Geoff and me.
[34:37.100 --> 34:38.360]  It's true. Yeah.
[34:38.940 --> 34:42.200]  We did Eric, Nick and Geoff last week, and I thought that went really well.
[34:42.300 --> 34:46.540]  Yeah. I mean, having Geoff in there, I think just has a buffer.
[34:46.620 --> 34:48.500]  I just want to know what Gavin and Nick would do
[34:48.500 --> 34:51.380]  in a video, like if they were just to like do something.
[34:51.580 --> 34:54.600]  I've made content with just me and Geoff and just me and Andrew,
[34:54.740 --> 34:56.660]  but I've never done anything even with just you.
[34:58.620 --> 34:59.800]  Yeah, I think that's true.
[35:00.080 --> 35:01.000]  I think you'd hate it.
[35:01.380 --> 35:03.560]  No, I think I think we could do it and it would be fine.
[35:03.620 --> 35:06.100]  I just want to know what I just want to know where Nick
[35:06.920 --> 35:10.120]  would take you or vice versa and like what that would be.
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.580]  And so the next episode of regulation tune up we record is Gavin and Nick
[35:14.580 --> 35:15.640]  as the team.
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.140]  Oh, that's got to be and I cannot wait to see.
[35:19.360 --> 35:22.020]  It's got to be it's got to be like a food pendulum.
[35:23.520 --> 35:25.640]  I just one of them is a one of ten.
[35:25.720 --> 35:27.680]  The other things it's ten of ten and they have to come to the middle
[35:27.680 --> 35:28.500]  somehow and agree.
[35:30.700 --> 35:33.660]  I'm trying to think of of like Mario Party
[35:34.120 --> 35:37.400]  mini game team ups I've had with Nick and have they gone well?
[35:38.420 --> 35:42.400]  All right, because GTA you're not on a team with Nick, Nick and I.
[35:43.980 --> 35:46.800]  Mario Party, I don't feel like you ever had an alliance with Nick either.
[35:46.960 --> 35:47.720]  I don't think we did.
[35:47.800 --> 35:48.980]  We never did like cut the meat.
[35:50.360 --> 35:51.160]  No, we did once.
[35:51.420 --> 35:53.440]  Oh, yeah. You know, yeah, you guys definitely did.
[35:53.640 --> 35:55.080]  Oh, yeah, because Andrew and our partners a bunch.
[35:55.220 --> 35:56.220]  Yeah, we tied.
[35:56.220 --> 35:59.620]  Yeah, we beat you guys in the jerk off games consistently.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.440]  It's pretty cool, man. Way to go.
[36:01.820 --> 36:04.900]  I think Geoff and I beat you in rowing. Yeah.
[36:05.660 --> 36:07.780]  Speaking of jerking off, I got something with that too later.
[36:08.060 --> 36:11.300]  Oh, really? I mean, we can just get to it right now if you like.
[36:11.420 --> 36:13.480]  No, we're having fun talking about whatever we're talking about.
[36:14.140 --> 36:18.600]  What if we recorded an episode one day where we all had like a slider
[36:18.600 --> 36:21.380]  from one to ten open and we all streamed our view
[36:21.380 --> 36:24.880]  and we would keep it updated with how the episodes going on,
[36:24.880 --> 36:26.720]  where it lies out of ten.
[36:26.720 --> 36:28.680]  I hate that. I think it's a terrible idea.
[36:28.980 --> 36:29.660]  It's pretty good.
[36:30.100 --> 36:31.240]  You guys should. It's insane.
[36:31.600 --> 36:33.140]  I would. Yeah, that would be a terrible idea.
[36:33.400 --> 36:34.200]  I'm going to be at a three all the time.
[36:34.680 --> 36:35.540]  You would never like.
[36:35.960 --> 36:37.580]  I never feel good about our content.
[36:40.100 --> 36:43.200]  It would just sit on three for the whole episode no matter what we said.
[36:43.240 --> 36:45.400]  It would probably bump up to four or five every once in a while.
[36:45.540 --> 36:46.460]  Andrew would just melt it.
[36:46.640 --> 36:49.740]  I imagine we'd all start at five and then Andrew would come in saying,
[36:49.960 --> 36:51.340]  you know, what's a corn seed?
[36:51.460 --> 36:53.340]  And I would immediately slide it up to an eight.
[36:54.440 --> 36:56.320]  Oh, I'd go down to a three.
[36:57.420 --> 36:58.800]  See, it averages out.
[36:58.880 --> 36:59.760]  Yeah, they meet in the middle.
[37:00.680 --> 37:05.540]  We'd be Geoff would be telling like the go go now level of like just hilarious story
[37:05.540 --> 37:06.860]  that only Geoff is capable of.
[37:06.920 --> 37:08.480]  And then he'd lower his number to a two.
[37:08.760 --> 37:10.660]  It would just be sad. It would be depressing.
[37:11.160 --> 37:14.440]  Because it would deserve it, because I would have fucked the story up in some way
[37:14.440 --> 37:15.700]  that you guys don't understand.
[37:15.820 --> 37:20.940]  But I do because it's my story and I know how bad I fumbled the fucking bag
[37:20.940 --> 37:24.340]  and it'll fucking plague me for the rest of my goddamn life.
[37:24.480 --> 37:27.100]  Like when we fell down that mountain on that fucking horse,
[37:27.220 --> 37:29.460]  which is a better story than go go now.
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.340]  But I shit the bed.
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.560]  Still upset about it.
[37:33.580 --> 37:37.460]  You nailed the the bathrobe dog lockout hotel losing turkey.
[37:37.600 --> 37:38.300]  That was good.
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.240]  That's a baby story.
[37:40.300 --> 37:42.060]  I didn't see the turkey being left in the fridge.
[37:42.120 --> 37:42.840]  That was a good twist.
[37:43.180 --> 37:45.200]  Yeah, that would have bumped some numbers for me.
[37:45.600 --> 37:49.660]  So it'll be interesting at the end of us live sliding for the whole episode.
[37:49.660 --> 37:53.480]  We take the end result and we just up front say this is a, you know,
[37:53.820 --> 37:55.720]  a 7.3 out of 10 episode.
[37:56.740 --> 37:59.020]  Take the averages, people know what they're going to get up front.
[37:59.700 --> 38:02.420]  Oh, well, I feel like we need some.
[38:02.800 --> 38:04.980]  Nick, are you? What would be your average number?
[38:06.240 --> 38:06.920]  To start?
[38:07.280 --> 38:09.820]  Yeah, because I feel like you're the most optimistic of all of us.
[38:10.240 --> 38:12.380]  Oh, I'd start probably at a seven and then go from there.
[38:12.660 --> 38:14.360]  You think we're a seven out of the gate?
[38:14.900 --> 38:15.560]  See, that's the thing.
[38:15.580 --> 38:18.680]  We need somebody to be the opposite of Geoff to try to create the average.
[38:18.680 --> 38:19.460]  Oh, I see.
[38:20.060 --> 38:21.860]  But I instantly go to a 10 once I laugh.
[38:22.000 --> 38:23.860]  So, you know, you would have lost.
[38:24.020 --> 38:25.560]  So you open a 10. That's great.
[38:25.800 --> 38:27.160]  On the intro of this one.
[38:27.620 --> 38:28.340]  Yeah, it was a good intro.
[38:32.710 --> 38:36.550]  I, uh, I've been watching a lot of movies recently
[38:37.110 --> 38:40.890]  because I had a little bit of time off, so I was trying to catch up on some things.
[38:41.530 --> 38:42.310]  I've been watching.
[38:42.550 --> 38:45.190]  I caught up on all the Mission Impossibles that I hadn't seen.
[38:45.610 --> 38:46.930]  I'd missed four of those.
[38:48.250 --> 38:49.290]  Oh, that's my missed.
[38:49.290 --> 38:50.230]  Well, which ones did I miss?
[38:50.270 --> 38:52.390]  I missed Ghost Protocol
[38:53.410 --> 38:55.930]  and then Fallout and then Final Rec.
[38:55.990 --> 38:56.750]  So I guess three.
[38:56.930 --> 38:57.770]  I watched three of them.
[38:59.150 --> 39:00.110]  They're all fun.
[39:00.570 --> 39:02.550]  But I realized while watching it, do you remember?
[39:03.050 --> 39:05.030]  And I don't know if you had these commercials, Gavin.
[39:05.830 --> 39:08.110]  And to be honest, they were, I think, before my time even.
[39:08.830 --> 39:13.150]  But the Grey Poupon commercial, where when Grey Poupon
[39:13.150 --> 39:16.310]  was trying to take over from Heinz, try to get a market share from Heinz.
[39:16.310 --> 39:18.870]  And they're in the like limousine.
[39:19.190 --> 39:21.970]  Yeah. And the rich guy, like it's the rich guy.
[39:22.090 --> 39:26.470]  They're trying to they try to advertise Grey Poupon is like the classy mustard
[39:26.470 --> 39:28.610]  was their way to try to combat against.
[39:29.090 --> 39:31.410]  It's like a Rolls Royce pulls up to another Rolls Royce.
[39:31.410 --> 39:33.010]  And the guy rolls on the window. He says, Pardon me.
[39:33.030 --> 39:34.190]  Do you have any Grey Poupon?
[39:34.290 --> 39:36.130]  And then the other guy looks at me, goes, But of course.
[39:36.170 --> 39:37.870]  And then he hands it to him. Yeah, exactly.
[39:38.050 --> 39:41.390]  Yeah. They're like, Listen, this is the this is the rich dude's mustard.
[39:41.590 --> 39:44.090]  If you want to be classy, Grey Poupon.
[39:44.090 --> 39:46.510]  Why does he look like he's about to dip the dog in the jar?
[39:47.010 --> 39:50.970]  Because he loves his Grey Poupon, and that's what rich people do.
[39:52.670 --> 39:57.550]  Mission Impossible is the Grey Poupon of like action of like Fast and Furious.
[39:57.810 --> 40:00.510]  It's the same. They're equally dumb.
[40:00.890 --> 40:01.750]  They're just presented.
[40:01.890 --> 40:03.830]  It's presented in a way of like, this is serious.
[40:04.330 --> 40:06.190]  You you nailed it.
[40:06.350 --> 40:07.790]  I never thought about it that way.
[40:07.830 --> 40:09.030]  You're totally right.
[40:09.610 --> 40:12.670]  It's so dumb in a great way, and I enjoy it.
[40:12.670 --> 40:16.930]  But it's like they has critical prestige in a way the fast movies don't.
[40:17.190 --> 40:20.210]  But they are equally absurd, especially as they progress.
[40:20.650 --> 40:24.550]  I didn't realize that they were called the impossible mission force.
[40:24.870 --> 40:26.250]  I'd always heard IMF.
[40:26.350 --> 40:29.590]  There's a moment where they say what it actually stands for.
[40:29.630 --> 40:31.090]  And I was like, This is fucking ridiculous.
[40:31.590 --> 40:32.450]  This is insane.
[40:32.950 --> 40:36.810]  And also they lose all of their resources every movie.
[40:36.910 --> 40:37.870]  Like, I don't understand.
[40:38.030 --> 40:39.630]  Like, is there other agents?
[40:39.630 --> 40:44.350]  There's so many stupid things about all of these films, but they're a delight.
[40:44.830 --> 40:45.570]  They are a joy.
[40:46.070 --> 40:46.770]  However, I don't know.
[40:46.830 --> 40:48.410]  Have you guys seen all of them?
[40:48.790 --> 40:50.050]  Yeah, I haven't seen the newest one.
[40:50.450 --> 40:51.190]  They keep.
[40:51.550 --> 40:53.750]  And I guess it's not even so much in the newest one.
[40:53.790 --> 40:56.310]  It's more in like Fallout.
[40:56.790 --> 40:57.690]  It's really in Fallout.
[40:58.450 --> 41:02.910]  I can't tell if I'm weirded out because of Tom Cruise
[41:03.550 --> 41:06.170]  or if it's just an action movie trope.
[41:06.170 --> 41:10.630]  But they really like try to Jesus the Ethan Hunt character
[41:11.310 --> 41:13.990]  in a weird way that made me uncomfortable.
[41:13.990 --> 41:17.090]  But I couldn't tell if I was uncomfortable because it was Tom Cruise.
[41:17.230 --> 41:21.570]  Like, is that standard action guy procedure, you would say?
[41:22.230 --> 41:25.970]  Because they do this whole thing where his wife is dead, but not dead.
[41:26.470 --> 41:27.930]  And then she keeps showing up.
[41:28.130 --> 41:30.430]  But she's with she's in another relationship.
[41:30.470 --> 41:32.550]  So it's not I guess they're separated at this point.
[41:32.670 --> 41:35.770]  But it's because they do this insane monologue.
[41:35.770 --> 41:39.470]  Ving Rhames has this monologue about that they couldn't be together
[41:39.470 --> 41:41.990]  because if they were together, then the world would end essentially
[41:42.590 --> 41:45.810]  that he needs to be out there stopping the bad guys.
[41:45.950 --> 41:48.610]  Because if he doesn't, then the bad guys would win.
[41:49.390 --> 41:51.670]  Is his wife, Michelle Monaghan in those movies?
[41:51.710 --> 41:52.350]  She is. Yeah.
[41:52.390 --> 41:54.510]  She she sells spectrum Internet now.
[41:54.550 --> 41:56.110]  I see her on fucking every day.
[41:56.110 --> 41:57.650]  I wondered. Yeah.
[41:57.770 --> 41:59.530]  Because she had a run where she is in a lot of stuff
[41:59.530 --> 42:01.690]  and she is a prominent role in Mission Possible three
[42:01.690 --> 42:04.050]  and then has cameos and all the other ones.
[42:04.050 --> 42:06.750]  Well, that's why I assume they the characters made that decision
[42:06.750 --> 42:09.090]  is because she was targeted in Mission Possible three.
[42:09.610 --> 42:10.930]  Yeah, but they don't frame it that way.
[42:11.090 --> 42:13.510]  They're not like, hey, this happened once and it was bad.
[42:14.090 --> 42:17.350]  Ving Rhames has this monologue about how literally they cannot be together
[42:17.350 --> 42:19.290]  because the guilt of them being together
[42:19.290 --> 42:22.710]  would prevent the world from continuing to exist
[42:22.710 --> 42:24.390]  because he needs to be on the field.
[42:24.710 --> 42:25.850]  Yeah, he's not on the field.
[42:26.230 --> 42:27.270]  Then things are going wrong.
[42:27.750 --> 42:29.910]  And it's like you're part of a fucking agency.
[42:30.490 --> 42:33.970]  There are other agents certain like what is the rest of the IMF doing?
[42:33.970 --> 42:36.110]  Outside of disavowing you.
[42:36.830 --> 42:38.950]  Impossible missions, other impossible missions.
[42:39.650 --> 42:41.150]  But to like what scale?
[42:41.270 --> 42:43.250]  Like it just that's what I like about those protocols.
[42:43.430 --> 42:44.650]  They show a different team.
[42:45.010 --> 42:48.590]  It's the only time you ever see anybody else doing anything in the IMF.
[42:48.930 --> 42:51.810]  Also, when when do like when do the FBI
[42:52.750 --> 42:55.030]  just promote a mission to the IMF?
[42:55.110 --> 42:56.470]  What are they just like, impossible?
[42:57.130 --> 42:59.950]  Yeah, this this is an insane the classification
[42:59.950 --> 43:03.510]  that they only get the impossible missions is ridiculous.
[43:04.390 --> 43:08.370]  I always wondered this about about James Bond movies like we all
[43:08.370 --> 43:11.450]  we're all in love with 007, but that's just because he's the only one
[43:11.450 --> 43:12.390]  we get to hang out with.
[43:12.770 --> 43:16.990]  What if 009 is way cooler and we just don't get to see those stories?
[43:17.370 --> 43:20.490]  Yeah, I mean, you do get glimpses of other 00's in the movies.
[43:20.710 --> 43:23.290]  Yeah, but in such brief glimpses, you don't get to follow their lives
[43:23.290 --> 43:25.790]  and watch them gamble and shit, you know, and that's true.
[43:27.250 --> 43:30.030]  The 006 was Sean Bean, and I think one of the 00's
[43:30.030 --> 43:32.790]  was a clown that got shot and fell through a window.
[43:33.310 --> 43:35.730]  I want like I want I want a movie.
[43:36.190 --> 43:39.790]  I want Wilbur Smith 004.
[43:39.890 --> 43:41.750]  And I want to I want two hours of that.
[43:42.990 --> 43:44.310]  There's a scene.
[43:44.450 --> 43:47.330]  I really wish you would have seen the most recent Mission Possible in theaters, Geoff.
[43:47.730 --> 43:51.570]  There's a scene where he there's a character that's introduced
[43:51.570 --> 43:55.670]  that is like a master pickpocket and their way of illustrating
[43:55.670 --> 44:00.070]  that Ethan Hunt is an equal level pickpocket as he does street magic
[44:00.070 --> 44:04.210]  in front of the frame where like he's like, oh, this key.
[44:04.330 --> 44:07.050]  And he just flicks it in your like his hand is empty.
[44:07.190 --> 44:08.070]  And then he has a key there.
[44:08.110 --> 44:09.330]  He does like a little wrist flip.
[44:09.430 --> 44:13.510]  And he's like, this key is a fake one, unlike the one we have.
[44:13.550 --> 44:15.710]  And then he uses his other hand to show the real key.
[44:16.310 --> 44:17.590]  It is fantastic.
[44:18.050 --> 44:20.150]  Doesn't he do a Mission Impossible one with the knock list?
[44:20.250 --> 44:22.350]  He's like messing with...
[44:22.350 --> 44:26.170]  Yes, he does like some hand magic in that one as well.
[44:26.250 --> 44:29.350]  But it just it feels so out of the way it's framed.
[44:29.350 --> 44:31.590]  It's just his hands and it's just him doing magic.
[44:32.830 --> 44:36.030]  It's not that's not how pickpocketing like that's not
[44:36.030 --> 44:37.570]  that doesn't have anything to do with that.
[44:39.130 --> 44:40.530]  And then he does the raven,
[44:40.610 --> 44:43.310]  which is a specific type of magic trick where he makes it vanish.
[44:43.470 --> 44:44.690]  And I just don't know why.
[44:45.330 --> 44:46.330]  Does he have a raven on?
[44:46.550 --> 44:49.490]  And like, am I as someone who understands how this trick works?
[44:49.850 --> 44:52.750]  Am I supposed to believe that Ethan Hunt has a magnet
[44:53.310 --> 44:57.670]  that he's palmed that is connected to his jacket on the inside
[44:57.670 --> 45:00.110]  that retracts like it's insane.
[45:00.370 --> 45:02.790]  Would you say that seems impossible?
[45:03.250 --> 45:06.530]  I would. I would say it sounds like he's the man for the job.
[45:07.070 --> 45:09.610]  It is. So what would your bookend Mission Impossible be?
[45:09.690 --> 45:10.830]  The best and the worst.
[45:11.050 --> 45:13.170]  If you had to pick two. Oh, well, the best is three.
[45:14.670 --> 45:16.310]  The worst two.
[45:16.550 --> 45:17.450]  Oh, that's tough.
[45:17.910 --> 45:21.550]  You know, to probably choose ridiculous in like a different way.
[45:22.770 --> 45:25.930]  Two is once again, like too fast, too furious, essentially, were they?
[45:26.390 --> 45:28.570]  They really like they went down in a way that wasn't enjoyable.
[45:30.650 --> 45:31.690]  What about you?
[45:32.330 --> 45:33.210]  I'd probably pick the same.
[45:33.670 --> 45:37.290]  Although I think a lot of online lists three doesn't ever get anyone at the top.
[45:37.510 --> 45:38.270]  That's insane.
[45:38.790 --> 45:39.610]  It's so good.
[45:40.090 --> 45:43.790]  Every Mission Impossible movie after three is the same movie to me.
[45:43.910 --> 45:46.190]  Just like it's all jumbled up in my head.
[45:46.230 --> 45:47.290]  I can't get them straight.
[45:47.610 --> 45:48.610]  I turn one on.
[45:48.650 --> 45:49.750]  It just seems like the other one.
[45:49.830 --> 45:51.910]  They're all they're fine, but they're all like the same.
[45:52.390 --> 45:55.550]  They get really excited about nukes after three.
[45:55.930 --> 45:57.930]  I miss there being like a mystery weapon.
[45:58.230 --> 46:01.250]  I really like the idea of what the fuck is a rabbit's foot.
[46:01.310 --> 46:02.030]  Who's making it?
[46:02.510 --> 46:03.430]  Who called it that?
[46:03.970 --> 46:06.850]  Just every other movie, it's them trying to deal with nukes.
[46:06.870 --> 46:08.310]  And this is not I don't know.
[46:09.150 --> 46:13.470]  They've like hit a point of escalation in a way that it was really
[46:13.470 --> 46:16.310]  it was great because I watched I caught up on the Mission Impossible movies.
[46:16.670 --> 46:19.270]  And then I watched the one Jason Bourne I hadn't seen,
[46:19.330 --> 46:21.330]  which is the most recent where Matt Damon comes back.
[46:21.770 --> 46:25.030]  And just like that is we do not need Jason Bourne anymore.
[46:25.030 --> 46:27.990]  Like Mission Impossible has so overshadowed
[46:27.990 --> 46:30.810]  any value that Jason Bourne had as a character.
[46:30.990 --> 46:33.110]  It's a shame, too, because that first movie is so good.
[46:33.310 --> 46:35.170]  They're really it's like it's really cool.
[46:35.370 --> 46:39.630]  I watched like the third one on a plane on my way back from Thanksgiving.
[46:39.890 --> 46:45.850]  The stakes are so low for the third movie in a series.
[46:45.850 --> 46:49.290]  You're just kind of like, oh, is this this just kind of it?
[46:49.390 --> 46:53.030]  Like they're not really it's just him and not really much else.
[46:53.030 --> 46:54.090]  It's very strange.
[46:54.090 --> 46:55.870]  It's really, really small feeling.
[46:56.230 --> 46:58.070]  Yeah, I guess he's not really saving the world that much.
[46:58.090 --> 47:01.590]  He's just saving his brain himself, I guess.
[47:01.710 --> 47:05.630]  Yeah, it's just really just him trying to keep Frank Potente alive or whatever.
[47:06.010 --> 47:07.050]  Yeah, it's just weird.
[47:07.610 --> 47:10.250]  I think it's just the problem with going too far into a series
[47:10.250 --> 47:14.470]  and it's just harder and harder to, you know, eclipse what you've previously done.
[47:14.610 --> 47:17.370]  I feel like that's the like 24 suffered from that, right?
[47:17.550 --> 47:20.710]  Like how many times can you save the president or stop a nuclear bomb
[47:20.710 --> 47:22.450]  from going off in America before?
[47:22.450 --> 47:25.490]  It's just like we saw this three seasons in a row.
[47:25.670 --> 47:26.730]  Who cares? Die hard.
[47:26.870 --> 47:30.150]  I feel like if I was a supervillain and I was creating a weapon,
[47:30.270 --> 47:33.550]  I would name it something that would be more embarrassing
[47:33.550 --> 47:35.850]  for like the FBI and the IMF to say.
[47:37.910 --> 47:40.330]  More embarrassing than impossible mission force.
[47:41.890 --> 47:44.990]  What if you were going to create an evil weapon?
[47:45.050 --> 47:45.650]  What would it do?
[47:45.810 --> 47:47.930]  Because you'd have to be the whole point of this, right?
[47:47.950 --> 47:49.910]  Is it's the same boring thing over and over again.
[47:49.910 --> 47:53.530]  It's like a bio weapon that wipes out half of humanity
[47:55.250 --> 47:57.950]  or it's a nuclear dirty bomb
[47:57.950 --> 48:01.670]  or some sort of a EMP that destroys all the technology.
[48:01.970 --> 48:04.290]  But what would your supervillain?
[48:05.460 --> 48:06.670]  I guess an attack be?
[48:07.130 --> 48:09.130]  I feel like it's a DNA altering gas.
[48:09.410 --> 48:13.270]  That means that humans can only survive by eating slugs.
[48:14.210 --> 48:18.370]  And slugs would be the new currency and people would just be guzzling slugs.
[48:21.050 --> 48:22.150]  That's a good one.
[48:23.090 --> 48:24.870]  That's really a really good one.
[48:24.990 --> 48:28.630]  That is there's lore slug guzzling.
[48:29.030 --> 48:29.950]  Yeah, I like it.
[48:30.310 --> 48:33.690]  I like the idea of a spoilable currency like like money.
[48:33.750 --> 48:34.570]  You've got to keep a life.
[48:34.890 --> 48:38.490]  Well, OK, so if you were really to long play this,
[48:38.510 --> 48:42.010]  you would first have the largest thing of slugs in the world.
[48:42.150 --> 48:43.690]  You'd have you'd have all the slugs.
[48:44.270 --> 48:45.390]  You'd have a slug vault.
[48:48.570 --> 48:51.330]  There would there be a thing where like they fill it with salt?
[48:52.250 --> 48:54.050]  Oh, I just want to take out the slug reserve.
[48:54.270 --> 48:57.010]  Yeah. Is there an anti slug weapon?
[48:58.750 --> 49:00.350]  That's just salt. Yeah, you're right.
[49:00.410 --> 49:01.650]  It's salt. It's just salt.
[49:01.790 --> 49:04.010]  It would just wherever salt is, that would be.
[49:05.070 --> 49:07.530]  Oh, my God. The food bank's been destroyed.
[49:10.090 --> 49:11.330]  Salt. Step one.
[49:11.870 --> 49:13.650]  Get the world addicted to slugs.
[49:13.650 --> 49:15.470]  Step two, own the salt.
[49:15.850 --> 49:17.230]  And then and then you've got the power.
[49:17.950 --> 49:20.350]  The food bank is a great name for a weapon.
[49:21.010 --> 49:23.430]  Deploying the food bank. Oh,
[49:25.250 --> 49:26.290]  that's a way better idea.
[49:26.390 --> 49:29.010]  My immediate thought, Gavin, was like something that would give everybody
[49:29.010 --> 49:30.210]  an arranged vertigo.
[49:30.550 --> 49:31.350]  They'd fall over.
[49:31.770 --> 49:33.090]  It's like the world is spinning.
[49:33.390 --> 49:34.390]  Just like a dizzy planet.
[49:34.670 --> 49:35.790]  This is a dizzy planet.
[49:35.950 --> 49:39.650]  I was thinking you could do like a like an airborne virus
[49:39.650 --> 49:42.130]  that once you it in, it enters your body.
[49:42.130 --> 49:46.530]  It gives you crippling arthritis in whichever is your dominant hand.
[49:46.870 --> 49:49.390]  So then you have to use your other hand for everything for the rest of your life.
[49:49.450 --> 49:52.350]  And so we have a whole population of people that suck at writing
[49:52.350 --> 49:55.570]  or shooting guns or opening combo locks.
[49:57.150 --> 49:59.610]  Everyone over the age of 60 can't log into anything
[49:59.610 --> 50:00.830]  because they can't read their poster.
[50:04.730 --> 50:07.650]  It's good. It's like a zombie movie for arthritis.
[50:07.950 --> 50:09.610]  Like The Last of Us, but arthritis.
[50:10.410 --> 50:13.670]  That might be the dumbest trope in movies, by the way, is figuring out
[50:13.670 --> 50:16.310]  the password based on shit on on the desk.
[50:17.130 --> 50:19.310]  Like it's never going to be it.
[50:19.510 --> 50:22.790]  It's never going to be like the author of a book or like a line in the book.
[50:22.810 --> 50:25.730]  It's just going to be written on a post-it note or it's not going to be anywhere
[50:25.730 --> 50:28.070]  nearby. People always figure out from books.
[50:29.090 --> 50:31.130]  Yeah. And I don't feel like you see that a lot.
[50:31.170 --> 50:34.150]  I'm trying to think of the last movie I saw where they hacked the computer
[50:34.850 --> 50:38.270]  via like a book or like a note or something like that.
[50:38.350 --> 50:40.310]  I think it happened in The Watchmen or Watchmen.
[50:40.850 --> 50:42.990]  Does it? The show or the movie?
[50:42.990 --> 50:45.090]  The movie. I don't remember.
[50:45.210 --> 50:46.370]  I haven't seen it in a long time.
[50:47.170 --> 50:48.570]  But even that was a while ago.
[50:48.770 --> 50:50.490]  Was that like 2010, 2011?
[50:50.910 --> 50:51.510]  A long time ago.
[50:52.050 --> 50:54.010]  I feel like it happens pretty regularly on TV.
[50:54.630 --> 50:56.810]  It's like the equivalent of finding the keys
[50:58.010 --> 50:59.530]  in the car above the
[51:00.990 --> 51:02.110]  whatever the thing is called.
[51:03.170 --> 51:08.270]  I want to I want to get a safe that has a sun visor in it just so I can keep stuff under it.
[51:11.030 --> 51:15.090]  That's what you should do is put your passwords above your sun visor.
[51:16.830 --> 51:18.910]  People try to nick the card, pull it down.
[51:18.990 --> 51:22.610]  It's like the password to my bank instead of the key to the car.
[51:22.910 --> 51:25.990]  And then the keys to the car under your keyboard where the postman would be.
[51:31.050 --> 51:33.050]  I I didn't share this.
[51:33.130 --> 51:35.830]  Did I have the posters I found for movies on the Xbox store?
[51:36.210 --> 51:37.870]  Ever talk about this? This is my notes.
[51:37.870 --> 51:39.830]  No, I don't. I don't think so.
[51:40.090 --> 51:40.930]  Let me pull this up.
[51:41.050 --> 51:43.130]  So I was I was just looking. They had a deal.
[51:43.510 --> 51:46.770]  They're like, hey, movies are 70% off on the Xbox store.
[51:47.090 --> 51:48.390]  And I was just scrolling through.
[51:49.170 --> 51:52.750]  And I don't know when was the last time any of you just like looked
[51:52.750 --> 51:55.150]  at a marketplace like that for buying movies.
[51:55.570 --> 52:00.370]  But some of the box art in them is fucking insane.
[52:00.690 --> 52:06.330]  It is like I don't know where it came from or like who authorized it.
[52:07.590 --> 52:11.850]  The first one I saw here, one second, let me just retrieve this really quick.
[52:12.250 --> 52:15.290]  The first one I saw was for the classic film, Mouse Hunt.
[52:16.170 --> 52:17.830]  Everybody loves Mouse Hunt.
[52:19.390 --> 52:21.290]  Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Mouse Hunt.
[52:22.150 --> 52:24.490]  Nathan Lane, Lee Evans, Mouse Hunt.
[52:25.150 --> 52:27.350]  This is I'm putting it in our chat right now.
[52:27.430 --> 52:29.250]  This is the poster on the Xbox store.
[52:29.290 --> 52:32.350]  If you were to buy Mouse Hunt, this is the official image.
[52:32.870 --> 52:34.730]  This is a studio film.
[52:36.330 --> 52:42.870]  This is tens, if not a hundred million dollars of entertainment.
[52:44.090 --> 52:46.790]  It's just a mouse.
[52:47.370 --> 52:51.410]  It looks like it looks like something Nick made in a pinch
[52:51.410 --> 52:53.330]  because Geoff couldn't make a thumbnail.
[52:57.140 --> 53:01.230]  It looks like whoever made the poster, their dog ate it
[53:01.230 --> 53:04.550]  and they had to make a new one on the way to the meeting.
[53:05.050 --> 53:08.270]  It is it doesn't have an actor name on it.
[53:08.630 --> 53:10.210]  It just says Mouse Hunt.
[53:10.430 --> 53:14.850]  And it is the shittiest looking mouse in a like a chef outfit
[53:15.470 --> 53:18.350]  eating cheese with an olive.
[53:18.950 --> 53:20.970]  He becomes the cheese tester, doesn't he?
[53:21.410 --> 53:25.470]  If you look at the other Mouse Hunt posters, they keep reusing the same mouse.
[53:25.590 --> 53:26.790]  But like, it's insane.
[53:27.130 --> 53:29.890]  I've just found my Blu-ray of it. Yeah.
[53:30.510 --> 53:32.310]  He's he's on the back.
[53:33.070 --> 53:35.330]  Oh, he's on the back of the Blu-ray. Yeah.
[53:36.210 --> 53:37.610]  Oh, can we see it?
[53:38.090 --> 53:40.870]  Hell yeah. See, he's double fisted.
[53:40.950 --> 53:42.610]  Wait, what? All of us.
[53:44.610 --> 53:45.810]  What? What?
[53:46.390 --> 53:48.770]  What? What language is that?
[53:48.970 --> 53:51.130]  Is it German? I don't.
[53:51.510 --> 53:53.070]  Oh, wow. It's got no mouse.
[53:53.350 --> 53:57.730]  M-A-U-S-E-J-A-G-D.
[53:58.170 --> 53:59.310]  Mouse engulds.
[54:00.290 --> 54:04.170]  Eric just posted one where instead of cheese, he's holding a piece of toast
[54:04.170 --> 54:05.350]  that has a bite out of it.
[54:05.590 --> 54:07.350]  Now, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
[54:07.570 --> 54:10.170]  That's what we've we've seen. Nice mice looking silly.
[54:11.730 --> 54:14.410]  What is going on?
[54:14.830 --> 54:18.830]  What is Mouse Hunt has the coolest posters?
[54:23.590 --> 54:26.950]  Un ratacito duro de roer?
[54:29.590 --> 54:32.790]  It looks like the mouse is protecting the cheese
[54:32.790 --> 54:35.130]  and he's going to attack these men.
[54:35.590 --> 54:38.450]  And they're hiding behind a bunch of mouse traps.
[54:38.750 --> 54:41.390]  Wow. Can we do a mouse hunt watch along?
[54:42.510 --> 54:44.670]  I think I don't think I've ever seen it.
[54:45.210 --> 54:49.090]  Oh, God, I think I was going to say I think I saw it when it came out,
[54:49.170 --> 54:50.990]  which was what? Nineteen what?
[54:51.370 --> 54:53.730]  Ninety seven, I think it said. Probably. Yeah.
[54:53.870 --> 54:54.630]  I mean, that's a classic.
[54:55.150 --> 54:56.210]  Oh, I should watch it.
[54:56.310 --> 54:57.150]  No, let's do it.
[54:57.570 --> 54:59.110]  Let's watch it. Yeah, let's do it.
[54:59.270 --> 55:02.050]  Well, we're doing a different watch along this month.
[55:02.130 --> 55:05.150]  I'm very excited about as the Falcon event.
[55:05.450 --> 55:08.850]  We're doing a doing a live watch along where I get to pick the film
[55:08.850 --> 55:12.450]  because I won the summer movie battle.
[55:12.930 --> 55:13.670]  Can I make a record?
[55:14.010 --> 55:15.290]  Obviously, you're going to pick the film.
[55:15.370 --> 55:16.270]  Can we make recommendations?
[55:16.750 --> 55:18.610]  You can't already have it decided, but go ahead.
[55:18.710 --> 55:20.430]  Maybe your recommendation will be my film.
[55:20.910 --> 55:21.450]  Mouse Hunt.
[55:22.590 --> 55:24.450]  Oh, that's a good one.
[55:25.010 --> 55:26.530]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[55:26.630 --> 55:29.470]  Honestly, just because the squeak shall inherit the earth.
[55:32.150 --> 55:34.450]  Andrew, that's our thumbnail for the episode.
[55:34.810 --> 55:36.670]  Andrew, Andrew, I have a question.
[55:37.090 --> 55:37.570]  Yeah, of course.
[55:38.150 --> 55:40.490]  Are you a man or are you a mouse?
[55:40.610 --> 55:41.570]  The hunt is on this Christmas.
[55:42.410 --> 55:45.310]  These are these are crazy.
[55:45.610 --> 55:48.270]  Why are there so many posters for Mouse Hunt?
[55:48.550 --> 55:50.750]  I don't know, but it is a joy.
[55:50.750 --> 55:53.130]  What is going on?
[55:54.610 --> 55:55.970]  There's a large variety.
[55:56.410 --> 55:59.010]  God, this is just a revolver
[55:59.770 --> 56:01.350]  pointed at a mouse.
[56:02.190 --> 56:03.310]  That's brutal.
[56:03.670 --> 56:05.210]  That can't be an authorize.
[56:05.230 --> 56:09.430]  That has to be an independent interpretation of the Mouse Hunt universe.
[56:09.710 --> 56:12.350]  Yeah, that has to be like a Mondo media or something.
[56:12.470 --> 56:13.410]  Right. God damn.
[56:14.070 --> 56:17.470]  I used to love the scene where Christopher Walken is the exterminator.
[56:17.870 --> 56:18.830]  Oh, yeah.
[56:19.010 --> 56:20.230]  So you remember him in it?
[56:20.230 --> 56:21.310]  That's crazy.
[56:21.410 --> 56:24.830]  He's like, he's got all these like lenses on his head and he's like,
[56:24.830 --> 56:26.390]  oh, now shit and stuff.
[56:26.450 --> 56:27.470]  Oh, that's great.
[56:28.970 --> 56:29.910]  Oh, what?
[56:30.070 --> 56:33.570]  So what what movie are you landing on, Andrew?
[56:33.590 --> 56:36.570]  We're going to be watching Snow Day, a childhood
[56:37.870 --> 56:38.830]  Nickelodeon classic.
[56:39.610 --> 56:40.230]  Hate this.
[56:40.730 --> 56:43.070]  I don't think I've seen it.
[56:43.130 --> 56:43.670]  Who's in it?
[56:44.470 --> 56:45.390]  Uh, Chevy Chase.
[56:45.810 --> 56:46.630]  Isn't it Chris Elliott?
[56:47.070 --> 56:47.470]  Children.
[56:49.750 --> 56:50.650]  Children are in it.
[56:50.750 --> 56:52.110]  I'll I'll watch anything with Chevy Chase.
[56:52.190 --> 56:52.490]  That's fun.
[56:53.410 --> 56:54.370]  I love Chevy Chase.
[56:58.430 --> 57:00.090]  The posters didn't stop there, though,
[57:00.730 --> 57:02.930]  because let's say you see Mouse Hunt, right?
[57:02.970 --> 57:04.830]  And you're like, man, that's a wacky mouse.
[57:04.870 --> 57:06.910]  I want more wacky animals.
[57:07.570 --> 57:08.530]  I got the bundle for you.
[57:09.310 --> 57:12.930]  The Animal Adventures 10 movie collection.
[57:13.050 --> 57:16.110]  Mouse, once again, just leading the show, eating cheese.
[57:16.630 --> 57:17.790]  Oh, it's got Rango.
[57:18.450 --> 57:19.430]  It's got Rango.
[57:19.630 --> 57:22.230]  It's got Pauly, Barnyard, Barnyard.
[57:22.630 --> 57:24.150]  And I'm guessing Hotel for Dogs.
[57:24.270 --> 57:25.410]  Probably Hotel for Dogs.
[57:25.490 --> 57:26.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:26.190 --> 57:27.810]  That's only half the movies, though.
[57:28.930 --> 57:29.530]  Yeah, what's left?
[57:29.730 --> 57:30.370]  I don't know.
[57:30.530 --> 57:31.970]  Well, it says it right here.
[57:32.050 --> 57:35.910]  It says Adventures with Animal Friends includes Hotel for Dogs,
[57:36.110 --> 57:39.650]  Pauly, Rango, Barnyard, Mouse Hunt, Black Beauty,
[57:40.590 --> 57:43.790]  Rhubarb, Zeus and Roxanne, the Red Pony
[57:43.790 --> 57:48.990]  and Juan Tan Tan, the Dog Who Saved the Olympses.
[57:49.170 --> 57:50.270]  The Dog Who Saved Dot Dot Dot.
[57:51.950 --> 57:53.450]  I just hope that's the title.
[57:55.770 --> 57:58.150]  Another classic Xbox poster,
[57:58.350 --> 58:00.970]  which like once again, never seen them advertised this way.
[58:01.430 --> 58:02.170]  Charlotte's Web.
[58:02.730 --> 58:03.830]  What do you need to know about that?
[58:03.910 --> 58:05.490]  Pig, pig and a spider.
[58:06.570 --> 58:07.510]  No actor names.
[58:07.690 --> 58:08.330]  That's once again.
[58:09.090 --> 58:10.650]  Is it the live action one or the?
[58:11.270 --> 58:12.730]  It's got to be the 2006.
[58:12.930 --> 58:13.830]  Yeah, live action.
[58:13.910 --> 58:15.010]  Yeah. Paramount. Yeah.
[58:15.350 --> 58:15.890]  Live action.
[58:16.290 --> 58:17.870]  And then some of them are just like fucked up.
[58:17.890 --> 58:22.070]  Like the Karate Kid one is just like whoever uploaded the image did a bad job.
[58:23.090 --> 58:26.510]  That looks like somebody took a picture of their DVD
[58:26.510 --> 58:28.870]  on their phone and uploaded it.
[58:29.010 --> 58:31.050]  What the fuck? Yeah, that's bad.
[58:31.630 --> 58:33.390]  It's a little milky and washed out.
[58:33.810 --> 58:37.330]  It looks like they Google, they Google image searched Karate Kid, too.
[58:37.350 --> 58:38.710]  And this took the first image.
[58:39.250 --> 58:40.050]  It did. Yeah.
[58:40.050 --> 58:44.210]  And the last one that brought me a lot of joy is once again, the same thing
[58:44.210 --> 58:49.290]  of short circuit to zero reference of what the movie is on the image.
[58:49.330 --> 58:52.330]  Just a zoomed in robot.
[58:52.850 --> 58:56.050]  I guess we're supposed to get that that Johnny's doing a peace sign.
[58:56.090 --> 58:56.970]  And that's the two.
[58:57.470 --> 58:59.670]  But they cut his fucking arm off.
[58:59.810 --> 59:01.910]  So it's just come floating in.
[59:01.950 --> 59:03.810]  So you don't even really know it's his.
[59:04.410 --> 59:07.070]  And there's no other defining info.
[59:07.230 --> 59:08.870]  This one might be the worst one to me.
[59:08.870 --> 59:13.970]  I would love if if anyone listening finds some insane movie posters
[59:13.970 --> 59:18.090]  in any digital markets or whatever, send them away, please.
[59:18.690 --> 59:22.950]  Put them in our server, our Discord server, or just as a reply to the link.
[59:23.210 --> 59:24.370]  I want to say I love these.
[59:24.890 --> 59:25.790]  These make me so happy.
[59:27.010 --> 59:30.050]  The premise that like somebody spent hundreds of hours
[59:30.050 --> 59:34.350]  making this film and millions of dollars, and then they're like,
[59:34.470 --> 59:36.210]  oh, let's you know what? I'm proud of it.
[59:36.210 --> 59:37.450]  Let's see. It's on.
[59:37.550 --> 59:38.690]  I bet you it's on the store.
[59:38.870 --> 59:42.070]  And then that image from Mouse Hunt shows that like all your work
[59:42.070 --> 59:43.850]  gets boiled down to that mouse.
[59:44.530 --> 59:45.610]  It's so funny to me.
[59:46.110 --> 59:50.190]  The one that I think of as just worst movie poster
[59:50.190 --> 59:54.970]  that I hated looking at as a kid, but it should have been a thing for me was.
[59:55.150 --> 59:57.050]  Man, well, let me hang on just a second.
[59:57.250 --> 59:59.670]  It is Geoff Yersey going overboard.
[59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.690]  The Adam Sandler movie.
[01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.950]  Oh, no.
[01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:06.730]  Here's the cover.
[01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.970]  I know of it. I know of it.
[01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:11.410]  I've never seen it. Awful looking.
[01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.390]  I don't like looking at it.
[01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:17.550]  His head, why his chest is so long
[01:00:18.290 --> 01:00:22.930]  and then his head is like pre-photoshopped on.
[01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.290]  Yeah, everything about it is ugly.
[01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.510]  I hate it. I hate it.
[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:28.810]  I've never seen this.
[01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.670]  I don't remember the movie at all.
[01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:35.230]  I it must have been from like the early mid 90s.
[01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.910]  I just remember it being not for me.
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.190]  I just hated the look of that poster. Awful.
[01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:44.590]  Yeah, that is. Yeah, that's one of the worst ones I've seen.
[01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.970]  Just his head on the body.
[01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.770]  Is the body real?
[01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:52.630]  I think it's somebody else's body and they had to like make the shoulders
[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:56.050]  and everything like higher up to fit Adam Sandler.
[01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:57.770]  It looks really bad.
[01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:01.330]  Also, these ladies in the background, it looks like they're supposed
[01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:05.650]  to be diving into the water, but this boat's clearly going at a pretty good speed
[01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:06.650]  because it's got a weight.
[01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:09.150]  So I think that would be dangerous.
[01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:12.690]  Also, their knees look pretty locked and they're pushed forward.
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.510]  So if they're not like mid motion right now, they're going to fucking topple
[01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.970]  right over.
[01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:20.430]  And there's a giant fucking wall in front of them.
[01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:22.370]  Like they're going to they're going to clip that on their knees.
[01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:23.270]  That is damage.
[01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.770]  Yeah, they're both going to bang their laps on that railing.
[01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.650]  Yeah, they really are.
[01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.330]  The alternate poster for it is also equally just awful.
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.290]  It's terrible.
[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:32.130]  Oh, there you go.
[01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:32.770]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.510]  These are awful.
[01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:34.150]  Yeah, terrible.
[01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.510]  They had access to one image of his face.
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:37.770]  And yeah, yeah.
[01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.870]  Can I show you a current movie poster that I don't understand?
[01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:43.210]  And also the title's hilarious.
[01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:45.330]  I think it's based on a book and stuff.
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.170]  I don't know anything.
[01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.570]  I don't know anything about it.
[01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:55.930]  Night Bitch is the funniest name for something that you can do or see or read.
[01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.490]  Hey, man, what are you up to?
[01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:58.710]  I'll go see Night Bitch.
[01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:02.370]  Like it's a new Amy Adams movie, right?
[01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:05.070]  Yeah. Where she's like, it's kind of like a badass at night.
[01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.790]  Supposedly, it's just like a lady who gets fed up and just starts
[01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:12.070]  fucking shit up at night and then has like a normal life in the daytime.
[01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.450]  Supposedly, it's up for a bunch of awards.
[01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:17.350]  And Howard did a whole montage of like Good Morning
[01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.150]  America's and local news and fucking 6 p.m.
[01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.090]  not being able to say the name of the fucking movie.
[01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.810]  And he was just making fun of like, it's 2024 and you can't say the word Night
[01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:29.950]  Bitch. They're like night rhymes with witch, you know, and it's like
[01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:34.510]  who can't hear the word bitch at 8 p.m.
[01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:35.490]  on the fucking news?
[01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:39.710]  It just seems like a 30 Rock joke.
[01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:41.190]  It doesn't it? It does.
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:44.370]  It just feels it feels like
[01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:50.330]  it feels like, oh, man, they did a thing on 30 Rock called MILF Island.
[01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:52.510]  And then that feels like it became a thing.
[01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:53.210]  And then it did.
[01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.530]  And then like the floodgates are open now and we're in a world
[01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:59.030]  where Night Bitch exists. That's a
[01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:03.970]  I would love to play a game where we have to just guess
[01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.030]  what the plot is based on posters because they're so useless.
[01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:08.190]  Modern posters.
[01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:11.650]  There's such little info like Night Bitch to me.
[01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:14.490]  I would assume that it's like an Animorphs type story
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:17.650]  where Amy Adams becomes leader of the dogs
[01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:20.050]  and they do a bunch of mischief at night.
[01:03:21.610 --> 01:03:24.150]  Her and her dog posse. Night Bitch.
[01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:28.570]  I remember when I think it was when
[01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:32.150]  the second Austin Powers movie was coming out
[01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.190]  and I was watching someone review it on like daytime TV.
[01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:39.530]  And he and he was talking about all the characters like Doctor Who Returns.
[01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:42.690]  And there's a new character whose name is too rude to say,
[01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:47.830]  but I'll just call him FB and it doesn't stand for Farty Bottom.
[01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:51.530]  And I just remember being so intrigued about what that guy's name was.
[01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:55.270]  If it's not Farty Bottom, what could it be?
[01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:00.070]  That's such a weird way of not saying the character's name.
[01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:04.870]  Oh, man. Farty Bottom.
[01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.310]  Listen, I was a Farty Bottom after all that popcorn.
[01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:10.830]  I still don't know why you ate so much popcorn.
[01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:13.230]  I couldn't stop, man.
[01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.610]  It's my food.
[01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.810]  Do you have a food that you just can't end?
[01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:18.810]  Like once you start, it's just... Fucking hot dogs.
[01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.970]  You are a lean the pack on that one.
[01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:25.250]  Do you have one, Gavin?
[01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:28.970]  Well, you're I mean, you're asking the guy who'd rather be in,
[01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.870]  you know, nutrient cubes.
[01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:35.430]  Oh, I know. That's why I'm so curious if there is anything like that for you.
[01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:41.570]  I tell you what, one thing that I do have to I always eat too much of
[01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:45.610]  and I have to consciously stop myself from eating too much is Cadbury fingers.
[01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.670]  Oh, I sent you some of those.
[01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:51.290]  Yeah. I don't I don't know what that is.
[01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.930]  Let me look that up.
[01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:55.290]  They're like little chocolate coated cookies.
[01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.090]  Yeah, I feel like, oh, if I was just on autopilot,
[01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:00.330]  I would eat half a packet of those.
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:03.630]  Mm. Half of it does look good.
[01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:04.490]  They are good.
[01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.990]  Let's get some.
[01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:07.930]  What were they? Little fingers?
[01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:09.450]  No, that's Game of Thrones.
[01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:12.190]  I wouldn't mind getting Cadbury fingered.
[01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.090]  I tell you what.
[01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:18.670]  Oh, we should start wrapping up.
[01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.970]  If a Cadbury figure is in your ass, how long would it take to melt the chocolate?
[01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.590]  Oh, man, it's not long, baby.
[01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:30.530]  It's a mission impossible scenario where that's how you stop the bomb.
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:32.890]  You got to melt through the chocolate to get this.
[01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.670]  My ass was like a microwave.
[01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:36.970]  I could heat up burritos.
[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:43.630]  Oh, has it always been that way or has it progressed as your butt problems?
[01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:45.470]  I think it's progressed as my butt.
[01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:46.590]  I think it's a change.
[01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:47.950]  You know, bodies change over time.
[01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.110]  What's the coldest part of your body, would you say?
[01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:57.690]  Like if if your butt is like, I don't know, the Florida of your body.
[01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.850]  It's just always hot.
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:00.330]  What's the coldest?
[01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:01.130]  Toes.
[01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.890]  Probably toes or ears, where I feel cold the most.
[01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:05.590]  Oh, chilly ears.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.430]  Yeah. Interesting.
[01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:12.550]  My nose isn't quite as far away from the warmth of my face as Gavin's is,
[01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.050]  so I might not have the same issue there.
[01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.730]  But yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.150]  I wonder where the equator would be on my body.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.460]  Like if I were to divide things.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.020]  Like if you measured from toe to top of the head, where would the halfway mark land?
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.760]  Yeah. Like just as far as I know, temperature or.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.000]  So you go. Oh, I guess land is interesting as well.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.440]  Because you got a long back.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.560]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, it would be.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.780]  Yeah, it would look ridiculous.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.200]  I definitely I don't think my belly button is in the middle.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.520]  Is it supposed to be?
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.700]  I feel like generally it is.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:49.280]  That's where. Well, I guess hips, maybe.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:49.760]  Middle of what?
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.800]  It's the first time he's ever thought about belly.
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:57.080]  He's never mid way point of body.
[01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:59.880]  This just feels like Andrew's never thought about it
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.960]  before you asked him a question and he had to go about it generally.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.380]  Well, then I think about the hips.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.300]  I think the hips I'm thinking of because of magic shows
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.720]  where they cut the person in half.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.660]  And it's always like at the hips.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.060]  It's not at the belly button.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.180]  So I guess half a person would be the legs.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.780]  Generally, you think it'd be easier to saw somebody in half
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.280]  at the belly button than the hips to you got to go through fucking leg bones
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.100]  at the hips. That's a dense part.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.700]  Belly buttons, you know, you got your spine, but everything else
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.240]  it's like under the ribs, but it's above all that other bullshit.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.720]  Probably pretty soft spot.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.380]  Yeah. Why do people always cut off the legs instead of cutting the spine?
[01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.800]  Yeah. It's like you get one bad like
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.620]  and then you're through it.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:44.200]  But with the legs, you're fucking going all day long.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.840]  And also, if you cut the legs off, you got to make multiple trips.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.640]  If you've got both legs still attached to each other, you just sling
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.700]  them over your shoulder and you can carry both legs at the same time.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:53.840]  You know what legs are?
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.140]  The the fucking handles of the body.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:58.120]  That's what they are. That's a great point, Gavin.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:04.280]  All right. Well, somebody in half of the legs like they're on your shoulders.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.460]  Yeah, I feel like if I was doing it, I would have to like it would be
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.740]  so their crotch was like sitting on my shoulder.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.200]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.620]  You'd want their knees over like just bending over, right?
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.520]  Like a backpack, almost like you can make a human backpack out of them.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.320]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.160]  And you could like grab the ankles or probably the calves
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:24.260]  right below the knee would be like the most comfortable.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.960]  And then their knees and the rest of it just hangs off your back.
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:29.640]  Distributes the weight evenly, I would think.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.300]  And also any drip would go behind you as you're walking.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.240]  Andrew, have you scanned your head yet?
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.360]  I haven't because I've been having a hard time finding an app
[01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.180]  that will do like an accurate scan.
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.220]  All right. I'll send you one. I found one.
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.620]  OK. Oh, you did? Awesome.
[01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:45.040]  If you send me that. Perfect.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.380]  I want to print your head.
[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:48.280]  I want you to print my head.
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:52.280]  Here's hoping that in 2025 we get to print Andrew's head
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.740]  and we get to put puzzles together one more time.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.040]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:01.040]  We hope you had as much fun as we had.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:04.000]  I had a nine point three amount of fun.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.480]  I don't know what that translates into quality, but you'll no doubt let us know.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.820]  We'll see you next week for another banger of a seven out of a ten.
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:14.740]  Bye bye.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.420]  You can split downward, too.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.440]  I didn't even think about that.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.420]  Like a pizza when you go pizza across like down.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.400]  Oh, what?
