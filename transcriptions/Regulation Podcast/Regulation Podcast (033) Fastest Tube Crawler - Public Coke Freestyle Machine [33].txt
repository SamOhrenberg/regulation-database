[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 33, our
[00:07.840 --> 00:13.120]  very special Christmas episode. What? I don't know what the fuck that was in the background
[00:13.120 --> 00:20.400]  because it clipped. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With you, as always, my co-hosts Eric Baudour,
[00:20.640 --> 00:24.400]  Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, and Nick Schwartz. Merry Christmas, boys!
[00:24.940 --> 00:28.560]  Merry Christmas. I was screaming it's Christmas from that Slade song.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.580]  Oh, I gotta be honest with you guys. I'm thinking I'm done with bagels. Real 7 out of 10 food,
[00:33.680 --> 00:37.400]  if you ask me. What? You're insane. Not a fan. Bagels are the best.
[00:38.780 --> 00:42.420]  It's such a high score to stop wanting to eat it. I don't understand.
[00:42.800 --> 00:47.660]  Speaking of snow, Belichick, apparently, according to Eric, North Carolina hires
[00:47.660 --> 00:50.440]  Bill Belichick, legendary NFL coach. That's awesome.
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.880]  Joins college ranks and stunning career move. The five-year deal, right?
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.020]  What they're saying yesterday. Is it a stunning career move? He's still coaching football.
[01:00.080 --> 01:03.960]  That's stunning. That's what happened. Well, they shut down Rooster Teeth. And in a stunning
[01:03.960 --> 01:08.680]  career move, we kept doing podcasts. Yeah, like it's it's I don't if he became
[01:08.680 --> 01:12.360]  like a basketball coach, that would be a stunning career move. They're like, hey,
[01:12.640 --> 01:17.980]  he is coaching. If he became like a like a dog show competitor, I think that would be a stunning
[01:17.980 --> 01:23.860]  career move. A dog show competitor? Like he's not even a coach. He's on. No, no. Like he's like got a
[01:23.860 --> 01:28.580]  dog that he takes to dog shows and stuff. Yeah, like best in show. Oh, did you think I meant like he's a dog?
[01:29.500 --> 01:34.500]  Oh, he does have a dog. His dog drafted for the Patriots. He's got a very skilled dog.
[01:34.900 --> 01:39.180]  Is there a human dog show that people could do? What do you mean? The Olympics.
[01:40.700 --> 01:45.000]  Isn't that what a beauty pageant is? A beauty pageant is just a human dog show? Sort of.
[01:45.180 --> 01:49.740]  Yeah, they have to jump over bars and stuff. There are human dog shows where humans run around and
[01:49.740 --> 01:53.800]  jump over bars and stuff. I don't know if they're dogs, but they do it as horses.
[01:54.180 --> 01:59.120]  No, there's like I've seen on TikTok, there's like women or dudes will run around with like the stick.
[01:59.340 --> 02:02.740]  Oh, they oh, they have like the wooden horse competition thing where it's like, yeah,
[02:02.740 --> 02:06.760]  they have like the horse stick horse thing. Yeah. Stick horse dressage or whatever.
[02:09.620 --> 02:13.620]  The Olympics. I'm trying to think who I think would crawl through the tube the fastest
[02:13.620 --> 02:18.260]  between the four of you. Tube crawling? Tube crawling. Because the dogs run in and out of the
[02:18.260 --> 02:25.360]  tube. Oh, I bet it's Nick. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I think it's Nick. How's it Nick? I'm fast as fuck.
[02:25.380 --> 02:30.840]  Why? Why are you offended by it? You think you could crawl through some tubes pretty quick?
[02:31.220 --> 02:35.920]  I think I could race through some tubes. Really? I think I was built for the tubes.
[02:36.220 --> 02:40.240]  I think the Gavin of five years ago could race through some tubes, but come on, man.
[02:41.600 --> 02:45.720]  Wait, how old are you, Nick? 36. Well, as of this episode, 37.
[02:45.720 --> 02:52.200]  Happy birthday. Happy birthday. How long is the tube? What are the dimensions?
[02:52.560 --> 02:58.120]  It's a curved tube. Let's say it's maybe 10 feet from one entrance to the exit. I could probably
[02:58.120 --> 03:02.960]  just go full sprint and just slide through that puppy. Yeah, I'd be flying. Are you dolphin diving
[03:02.960 --> 03:07.140]  like in Call of Duty? I mean, for ultimate speed, I think I could be in and out of that tube in like
[03:07.140 --> 03:13.760]  maybe a second and a half. Oh, really? Yeah. I would put good money on Nick to beat you.
[03:13.760 --> 03:18.580]  Oh, I would also do that. I think I got it. I never thought about what the inside of those
[03:18.580 --> 03:24.440]  tubes look like. Oh, that's great. That's just a post of a child's tube at like a playground.
[03:24.840 --> 03:30.440]  Very small. Oh, I wouldn't even touch it. I just fly. Yeah, I would touch the the like the outside
[03:30.440 --> 03:35.100]  wall or the inside of the outside of the turn. What on the wall? And I would just slide through
[03:36.140 --> 03:43.640]  the inside of the outside of the turn. I just watched a season of Survivor. The stringy long
[03:43.640 --> 03:49.220]  dude always wins, always wins competitions. How long are you, Nick? Nick has got the most
[03:49.220 --> 03:55.060]  Survivor stringy long dude body of us all. I'm not that long. I'm pretty I'm short. I'm 5'10
[03:55.060 --> 03:58.920]  long. I'm 5'9 long. I'm putting the tube in. Yeah, but it's about like body distribution.
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.740]  Like he's real. He's real like like Nick's kind of rangy. So it's a long tube. It is
[04:05.740 --> 04:10.260]  like kind of fabric. So you can't just so if you dive through, you're just going to move the whole
[04:10.260 --> 04:16.340]  thing is moving. Yeah, you can't really slide through it. So is technique going to be I think
[04:16.340 --> 04:20.100]  shoe choice is going to be very important. Really? You're using shoes? That dog looks
[04:20.600 --> 04:26.200]  Eric posted a photo of a dog running out of tube and it looks like finding finding the best images.
[04:26.520 --> 04:35.440]  They look at this dog like posted up. There's a cat. Hey, hey, Eric. Yeah, that image with
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.640]  the cat at the other end, that's clearly an Amazon sale product. That's something you could
[04:39.640 --> 04:47.080]  buy. Can we buy that? Can you buy that? Can I buy that? It's 16 and a half feet. It is. Oh,
[04:47.100 --> 04:51.740]  man, I just don't know if it's been. Oh, no. Currently unavailable. I'll find one. I don't
[04:51.740 --> 04:57.700]  understand these product dimensions. If there's a way that you guys can explain this to me. It is
[04:57.700 --> 05:06.900]  5.05 L 0.6 W and 0.6 H meters. Everything's in meters. What don't you understand about any of
[05:06.900 --> 05:15.680]  that? So I know exactly what that says. That's 5.5 long. So that's 15 feet. Right. And then 0.6
[05:15.680 --> 05:22.440]  width and 0.6 height. So that puts it at about a half about a foot, 1.7 feet wide and not tall.
[05:22.540 --> 05:27.360]  Right. Somewhere about that. I think that's a three second tube for me. And you think that
[05:27.360 --> 05:32.180]  you have tube confidence because of your Italian heritage. I'm known for tubing.
[05:32.180 --> 05:39.260]  Mario. He's making Mario. Oh, the most iconic. Boy, that didn't come across. I don't know.
[05:40.140 --> 05:44.900]  He's a tube guy. The most iconic tube guy is Italian. OK, I'm going to instead I'm going to
[05:44.900 --> 05:49.220]  need that tube to be green just so I feel at home. Do you think of Mario as a tube guy? Think of him
[05:49.220 --> 05:54.960]  as a pipe guy. A tube and a pipe is the same, is it not? I don't think so. Because when you said a
[05:54.960 --> 06:00.700]  tube and he's Italian, it didn't come across as Mario to me. It came across as very confusing.
[06:00.700 --> 06:05.840]  That sounds like a you problem to me. Oh, OK, cool. Great. Thank you. They got it.
[06:06.140 --> 06:12.340]  Sample size was 50-50. Congratulations. So I think we should get one of these and then we'll each
[06:12.860 --> 06:16.400]  to make it fair, you know, when they do like land speed records, they have to race both directions
[06:16.400 --> 06:20.160]  and then they take the average. Oh, that's great. Just so there's no like wind advantage.
[06:20.560 --> 06:25.100]  So I think we both do two and we'll average our two scores and find out who's the most Italian.
[06:25.380 --> 06:29.280]  I'll practice on my kids. That sounded really weird.
[06:29.280 --> 06:36.720]  I found one. It's 18 feet long, which is what we're looking for, right? And then this is like
[06:36.720 --> 06:40.660]  not crazy. We want to bump that circumference up if we can a little bit, but that's what I'm
[06:40.660 --> 06:44.260]  looking for. That's the hard part is that when you get length, you're I think you're kind of
[06:44.260 --> 06:50.540]  sacrificing height on some of these. But I think maybe I found a couple. I think I'm just most
[06:50.540 --> 06:54.820]  blown away that the resident rat guy isn't getting involved in the, you know, rat run type.
[06:54.820 --> 06:57.280]  Oh, I'm not the fastest. Nick would be the fastest.
[06:57.740 --> 07:00.680]  We'll put a piece of cheese at the end. You don't think you could scramble and make that happen?
[07:00.940 --> 07:05.860]  Not not faster than Nick. No, no, I really I really do think I think Nick would be the
[07:05.860 --> 07:13.480]  fastest at dog sports. Yeah. I mean, you know, I think it's a perfect way to put it. I agree.
[07:13.680 --> 07:18.380]  I completely understand what he means and agree with him. Yeah, absolutely. So here's what I found
[07:18.380 --> 07:25.420]  and I might I might order this. Oh, looks like it's right. Oh, yeah. Is there a color that we
[07:25.420 --> 07:31.400]  want? Red, green, green. Oh, there's a dark. Is this does this read green to you? I'm just making
[07:31.400 --> 07:35.220]  sure that that reads green to you. And it's not going to be a thing where it's like that's gray.
[07:35.460 --> 07:41.940]  It's fine. I'm fine with that. Close enough. OK, OK. Then I think that's it. I'll order it
[07:41.940 --> 07:47.380]  and then we'll set it up in Geoff's backyard, I guess. It looks like it looks like we can add.
[07:47.380 --> 07:52.020]  How long is it? Eighteen. It is. My current backyard is not big enough. We'll have to take
[07:52.020 --> 07:55.960]  it to the park and do it. We can put some bends in it and stuff. You know what I mean? Like it
[07:55.960 --> 07:59.560]  doesn't have to go the full 18. It can go like nine and then like nine to curve back around.
[07:59.580 --> 08:04.900]  So that way, like the start and the end are like the same. Can we bring items that we think might
[08:04.900 --> 08:11.480]  help us? Oh, like like like your favorite chew toy or like what do you mean? Like a Scooby snack?
[08:11.540 --> 08:17.360]  What are we thinking? I was thinking maybe like a lube soaked T-shirt. I'm going to I'm going to say
[08:17.360 --> 08:24.080]  no on a lube soaked T-shirt just because I don't want to see it. Yeah. Also, also, I feel like
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.280]  lubricant is something that both competitors have to agree on, because when one is lubricated,
[08:29.380 --> 08:34.540]  both are, you know, at the end of the day, like Nick's going to get all messy going through that
[08:34.540 --> 08:39.700]  after you. If he's not on board with it, you know, I actually feel he could be advantageous to the
[08:39.700 --> 08:44.640]  person going through who like that might be too slippery for Gavin. You might just be rolling in
[08:44.640 --> 08:50.880]  this tube. You think he'd be over lubed? Yeah, I think he would properly lube the tube for Nick to
[08:50.880 --> 08:56.160]  just slide on through. I'm hoping that I would be running full tilt and I just glide through all
[08:56.160 --> 09:00.780]  lubed and then Nick goes for like a scrambling approach, but he just he doesn't get purchased
[09:00.780 --> 09:05.620]  and he's just slipping around in there. He like wobbles like on a cartoon. He's like because he
[09:05.620 --> 09:16.580]  can't catch a grip. So does anyone else want to get involved and try with us? I trust you. I think
[09:16.580 --> 09:22.200]  you're good. I'm happy to do it, but I'm also fucking 50 years old essentially at this point,
[09:22.300 --> 09:26.060]  so I don't think there's any chance in hell that in my advanced age I'm going to do anything other
[09:26.060 --> 09:32.280]  than cause some sort of a nagging injury that will go on for six to eight weeks. Yeah, you're still
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.500]  recovering from the dog toy being thrown at you. I'm concerned about. I'm still dealing with a face.
[09:37.780 --> 09:43.220]  Yeah, that's true. I was at the dentist right before we recorded today. Oh, did you you get
[09:43.220 --> 09:47.440]  injections? Do you have Botox yet? I haven't done the Botox yet, but I have been doing dry needling,
[09:47.540 --> 09:55.340]  which is pretty bad. Oh God. It's like acupuncture, but they move the needle around and once it's
[09:55.340 --> 10:01.620]  inside of you and pop stuff like muscles. Oh God. To cause spasms. Oh, that sounds terrible. It's
[10:01.620 --> 10:05.900]  take the thing about the thing of the worst part of acupuncture and then like make it
[10:06.540 --> 10:12.200]  significantly worse. Is there medical science that shows that that works? I assume so. I just
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.360]  go to the guy behind the H-E-B, but he's got to have science from somewhere, right? No, of course
[10:17.360 --> 10:22.020]  there's medical. I'm going to like a sports therapist to get it done. That isn't okay. I
[10:22.020 --> 10:26.240]  feel like some of that stuff is sketchy. Not as in like you can hit the ball, you just have to believe
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.040]  in yourself, but more like you've got an injury and here's how we fix it. I don't think cupping
[10:30.040 --> 10:34.600]  does anything, but that's like a predominant thing. I don't know. I've never done cupping.
[10:34.880 --> 10:39.040]  Oh, I really like it. It helped me with a lot of range of motion when I was having it. Oh,
[10:39.100 --> 10:43.280]  really? Yeah, it shoots my back. I really liked it. But don't worry. People leave comments and
[10:43.280 --> 10:46.940]  go, it's actually fake and don't worry about it. Fair enough. It worked for me and I really
[10:46.940 --> 10:50.460]  liked it. Yeah, that's awesome. I really enjoyed it. Pretty popular in the NBA. And I know Emily
[10:50.460 --> 10:55.660]  has had it done before, but I have no experience. What about the balloon in the nostril thing?
[10:55.980 --> 10:58.840]  You ever thought about getting that done? Have you ever needed that? I don't think we're allowed
[10:58.840 --> 11:02.420]  to do that. Didn't we agree that we're not allowed to do that? No, that's throats. That's
[11:02.420 --> 11:07.140]  throats. This is the nostril. I feel like the sinuses should not be messed with it that way.
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.140]  Oh, the guy that's down for having the balloon explode in his mouth is worried about the
[11:12.140 --> 11:17.340]  nostril balloon? Yeah, a balloon in the mouth that is just being lightly inflated to see how
[11:17.340 --> 11:22.560]  big your mouth is isn't the same as stuffing a balloon up my nose and popping my sinus hole.
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.560]  Balloon in the mouth is worth two in the nose, man. It's, you know, you got to make a decision.
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.300]  Do you think your nostril holes are equal to your nose size generally, Gavin? Do you think the
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.380]  interior matches the exterior as far as- My nostrils are garbage.
[11:36.700 --> 11:39.840]  Really? They're tiny. It just narrows down.
[11:40.100 --> 11:42.020]  That sucks. They're completely useless.
[11:42.320 --> 11:46.660]  Do you think they're the same size or like one is better than the other? Because like,
[11:46.740 --> 11:51.480]  everybody has like one ball that hangs lower and all boobs are different, right? So you've
[11:51.480 --> 11:55.400]  got to figure your nostrils would be slightly- like, is your left one better than your right one?
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.620]  If I inhale deeply and suddenly my right nostril collapses.
[12:00.120 --> 12:01.080]  What? Well, there you go.
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.380]  Do you have like a weaker nostril if you got it like slams closed?
[12:05.660 --> 12:09.220]  No. Lay off the cocaine, buddy. Jesus.
[12:12.540 --> 12:20.380]  Slams closed? Wait, so is your nose so powerful that the suction is like, it's bringing it in?
[12:20.820 --> 12:22.280]  Yeah. That's-
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.780]  There's a lot of give on my nostril flaps. They're very-
[12:25.780 --> 12:27.720]  Oh, you got flappy flaps?
[12:28.100 --> 12:31.580]  Yeah. So if you just take it at a massively deep breath,
[12:31.660 --> 12:36.060]  like you're trying to fill your lung in one second through the nose, it just goes in smooth?
[12:36.300 --> 12:40.060]  I mean, it kind of throttles a little bit, but it doesn't- like, I wouldn't describe it as collapsing.
[12:40.300 --> 12:41.980]  Yeah, it just went in smooth. I got no problem with it.
[12:42.220 --> 12:46.060]  I think we need to get you that nose balloon, man. I think if anyone needs it, it might be you.
[12:46.560 --> 12:49.340]  Yeah, what's that gonna do? Temporarily stretch my nose hole?
[12:49.340 --> 12:49.820]  Yeah.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.420]  Yeah, we need to get in there and make some lattice work or something.
[12:52.640 --> 12:54.540]  Yeah, I need like a stent or something.
[12:54.640 --> 12:55.740]  Like they do in a mine.
[12:55.940 --> 13:00.940]  I got- what he's describing with like the balloon in your nostril expanding and everything,
[13:01.100 --> 13:02.420]  I did that with my esophagus.
[13:02.920 --> 13:03.280]  Really?
[13:04.120 --> 13:08.360]  I had a stricture and a narrowing in my esophagus where food would get stuck.
[13:10.260 --> 13:15.400]  And I went to a gastroenterologist and they're like, oh yeah, well we can just like knock you
[13:15.400 --> 13:18.720]  out and then we shove a balloon down your throat and then we expand the balloon. You'll just have
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.340]  to get it done again in like 15 years. But it was a night and day change. Like my life is so
[13:24.340 --> 13:25.360]  different after that.
[13:25.520 --> 13:28.080]  Did it hurt at all? Like when you woke up, was your throat sore?
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.340]  I mean, like not like my throat, but like the middle of my chest ached for like a day or two.
[13:33.420 --> 13:35.780]  And like, that was it. Like really, really not bad.
[13:35.940 --> 13:36.920]  Can you deep throat now?
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.040]  Yeah. And it can go all the way down to the stomach. So if like, I don't even have to swallow.
[13:42.300 --> 13:43.520]  That's like the deepest throat.
[13:43.680 --> 13:45.260]  Dude, if you can get it all the way down there.
[13:45.780 --> 13:48.760]  But you might get, you might get burned by my stomach acid.
[13:49.480 --> 13:51.620]  Can I push a hot dog down your throat?
[13:51.880 --> 13:53.740]  Oh, I don't like it.
[13:55.360 --> 13:56.540]  Can I do what?
[13:56.780 --> 13:58.180]  Can I push a hot dog down your throat?
[13:58.340 --> 14:01.260]  No, it just made my esophagus like a normal person's esophagus.
[14:01.380 --> 14:03.000]  No, I don't want to see that.
[14:03.360 --> 14:04.660]  I don't, I'm not going to do it.
[14:04.840 --> 14:06.740]  You don't think you could relax it and I could just...
[14:06.740 --> 14:09.280]  No Eric, don't do it. I know you're thinking about it, but say no.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.080]  No, absolutely. No, I absolutely couldn't.
[14:11.180 --> 14:15.040]  If Gavin pulls a hot dog from the throat, can he become the king of the land? Is he the
[14:15.040 --> 14:22.280]  chosen one? He's got a balloon in his nostrils getting expanded, pulling a hot dog out of my
[14:22.280 --> 14:24.400]  throat. This is pretty cool. Is that what the show is?
[14:24.560 --> 14:27.280]  I could absolutely fit a hot dog in my nose though.
[14:27.560 --> 14:28.200]  Four out of 10.
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.680]  I bet I could hold two dogs, one in each nostril. They just wouldn't go in very far.
[14:32.860 --> 14:35.020]  Oh, you think you could fit a dog in your nostril?
[14:35.160 --> 14:35.580]  I think so.
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.480]  There's no way. Well, mine at least, no way.
[14:38.580 --> 14:39.300]  I bet I could.
[14:39.540 --> 14:41.420]  You just said your nostrils were small.
[14:41.620 --> 14:42.560]  The actual...
[14:42.560 --> 14:43.620]  The pipage is small.
[14:43.620 --> 14:47.860]  Like the tunnel is small, but the openings are, you know, loose and flappy and huge.
[14:47.980 --> 14:48.840]  Hot dog flappy?
[14:49.020 --> 14:49.600]  I think so.
[14:49.780 --> 14:51.280]  How big is a hot dog? Like you could...
[14:51.280 --> 14:53.020]  Not the whole bun, just the...
[14:53.020 --> 14:53.280]  No.
[14:53.340 --> 14:53.680]  Yeah, just the dog.
[14:53.880 --> 14:55.700]  I don't think any of us were thinking bun.
[14:55.940 --> 14:57.420]  I think you could do that for sure.
[14:57.680 --> 14:59.060]  You said you could do it too. Do you think so?
[14:59.140 --> 15:01.140]  Yeah, I don't think it's that... I don't think a hot dog is that big.
[15:01.240 --> 15:02.800]  I think it's bigger than you two think.
[15:03.240 --> 15:03.980]  I think so.
[15:09.050 --> 15:13.930]  It just reminds me, was it... was it Bernie or Gus or someone said that they
[15:14.910 --> 15:16.890]  could fit their cock through a toilet roll?
[15:17.010 --> 15:17.430]  That was Bernie.
[15:19.030 --> 15:20.330]  Was it that he could or couldn't?
[15:20.490 --> 15:24.910]  He thought he couldn't, but he could. Or he could, but he couldn't. I don't remember.
[15:25.270 --> 15:27.290]  I don't think about his dick that much anymore, but...
[15:27.290 --> 15:27.730]  No, me neither.
[15:28.630 --> 15:29.390]  Apparently you did.
[15:29.710 --> 15:30.290]  Popped into my head.
[15:30.450 --> 15:32.390]  I don't think either of you could do the hot dog in the nest.
[15:33.110 --> 15:34.170]  Yeah, no, there's no way.
[15:34.170 --> 15:36.690]  Here, hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna send you guys a fucking photo.
[15:36.910 --> 15:39.390]  And if I can, Gavin definitely can.
[15:39.630 --> 15:43.750]  Even if you lubed it up with hot dog material, like some ketchup or some mustard,
[15:43.930 --> 15:44.890]  it ain't... it ain't going in there.
[15:45.070 --> 15:45.590]  Why do you think that?
[15:45.830 --> 15:47.410]  No way. That's way too small.
[15:48.450 --> 15:49.190]  That's so small.
[15:49.350 --> 15:52.830]  That's like hot dog size and that's not even stretching. That's just naturally open.
[15:53.170 --> 15:54.510]  I mean, that looks like stretching.
[15:54.850 --> 15:58.050]  That doesn't just look naturally. That doesn't look like a relaxed photo.
[15:58.330 --> 15:59.770]  Yeah, but that's not like external manipulation.
[15:59.990 --> 16:03.470]  If I get my... if I get my fucking hands in there and start opening stuff up, you could...
[16:04.170 --> 16:04.770]  Oh my God.
[16:06.390 --> 16:09.310]  And Gavin's got... he's so much more naturally capable.
[16:09.570 --> 16:10.730]  I'm gonna try and take a picture of my nose.
[16:10.890 --> 16:11.310]  I don't...
[16:13.890 --> 16:17.310]  This is... you guys can't do this. This isn't... it's not gonna work.
[16:17.510 --> 16:18.190]  But I want to see it.
[16:18.250 --> 16:21.190]  Well, maybe we'll try it on the same day we do Patagal.
[16:22.050 --> 16:26.610]  Do they need to be cooked? Is there a... like a thing sanitary wise?
[16:27.070 --> 16:28.730]  Are you okay with a raw dog in your nose?
[16:28.950 --> 16:30.290]  Yeah, I mean, they come cooked.
[16:30.410 --> 16:31.070]  They're cooked already.
[16:31.570 --> 16:31.930]  Yeah.
[16:33.350 --> 16:35.030]  You're just heating it up when you're...
[16:35.030 --> 16:37.910]  Yeah, I'll probably try and get it to body... like room temperature.
[16:38.190 --> 16:40.390]  I don't want to shock the nostril and have it contract.
[16:40.770 --> 16:43.410]  Have you guys played the Indiana Jones game?
[16:43.790 --> 16:44.050]  No.
[16:44.390 --> 16:45.310]  That has a lot of food in it.
[16:45.350 --> 16:46.950]  All right, you guys need to play it. It's really good.
[16:47.310 --> 16:50.610]  I'm not a big Indiana Jones guy. I became obsessed with that game.
[16:50.890 --> 16:51.650]  It is so much fun.
[16:51.710 --> 16:52.370]  Really? Oh.
[16:52.570 --> 16:54.730]  I thought Greg Miller gave it a pretty middling review.
[16:54.890 --> 16:56.190]  Yeah, he said it was like a six or something.
[16:56.670 --> 16:59.010]  Yeah, crazy. It's such a good game.
[16:59.290 --> 17:00.990]  The physics in it are ridiculous.
[17:01.570 --> 17:06.670]  It's so much fun to get into fights with the Nazis and the fascists and just hitting people.
[17:07.170 --> 17:08.530]  Like everything is a weapon.
[17:08.930 --> 17:12.410]  There's so many things are so you could grab like a skillet with bacon in it and eggs
[17:12.410 --> 17:14.190]  and just start hitting people with it.
[17:14.410 --> 17:15.910]  It is great.
[17:16.830 --> 17:20.170]  You have all these... I was thinking about like food and stuff because there's so much food in
[17:20.170 --> 17:23.770]  that game that you can eat and like boost your stamina, but you can also just throw it if you
[17:23.770 --> 17:25.830]  want to. Oh, fantastic.
[17:25.990 --> 17:27.910]  Could you stuff a sausage up a Nazi nose?
[17:28.310 --> 17:30.090]  Ah, no sausages, unfortunately.
[17:30.090 --> 17:31.450]  Can you throw bacon?
[17:31.870 --> 17:36.070]  Bacon you can't, but it like sticks in the skillet when you swing it.
[17:36.130 --> 17:38.270]  So like it stays there as you're hitting them.
[17:38.370 --> 17:39.210]  It's fantastic.
[17:39.470 --> 17:41.410]  Does he say lots of fun one liners?
[17:41.490 --> 17:42.790]  Does it sound like Harrison Ford?
[17:43.030 --> 17:45.610]  Oh, Troy Baker does such an insane job.
[17:45.930 --> 17:47.890]  He's so good as Harrison Ford.
[17:48.370 --> 17:50.090]  He does so yeah, he killed it.
[17:50.410 --> 17:51.870]  No, there's not a lot of one liners.
[17:52.110 --> 17:56.030]  Did you see the interview where he talked about like Todd Howard told him that like
[17:56.030 --> 17:57.730]  you will not be the voice of Indiana Jones?
[17:57.870 --> 17:58.970]  Did you did you hear about that?
[17:58.970 --> 18:02.590]  I saw that there's like headline where he was like he really didn't want him to be.
[18:02.810 --> 18:03.290]  He did.
[18:03.390 --> 18:06.070]  He told him you won't be the voice of Indiana Jones.
[18:06.230 --> 18:08.590]  So he auditioned for it and then got picked.
[18:08.690 --> 18:12.490]  And then it got down to a blind listening of three people.
[18:12.490 --> 18:14.970]  And every single person picked Troy Baker.
[18:15.370 --> 18:18.850]  And Todd Howard told him everyone picked you.
[18:19.010 --> 18:21.190]  So you will be Indiana Jones.
[18:21.810 --> 18:22.510]  He does great.
[18:22.890 --> 18:27.690]  I fell in love with that game because it's like a very kind of physics world.
[18:27.690 --> 18:31.170]  And the ragdolls are dumb where you can charge up your punch.
[18:31.350 --> 18:33.350]  You can do like a Falcon, Indiana Jones punch.
[18:33.670 --> 18:35.270]  And I was sneaking up.
[18:35.490 --> 18:36.630]  You can you can walk up.
[18:36.750 --> 18:40.870]  And if you hit like an enemy without them noticing you, you do more damage.
[18:41.170 --> 18:46.490]  So it was this Nazi sitting at a table and then two Nazis in front of the table,
[18:46.670 --> 18:50.890]  like probably like five, six feet away, looking the other direction like none of them.
[18:50.890 --> 18:52.030]  I was sneaking up on all of them.
[18:52.270 --> 18:56.010]  And I charged up my fist and I hit the Nazi in the back of the head.
[18:56.010 --> 18:58.750]  And just the physics like this wasn't a scripted event.
[18:59.230 --> 19:00.330]  I hit him so hard.
[19:00.470 --> 19:04.950]  His head went into the table and the table cracked in half just from the impact of it.
[19:05.070 --> 19:08.590]  And then that made a noise which alerted the two Nazis in front of them.
[19:08.750 --> 19:10.730]  And they turned around like, what the fuck was that?
[19:10.910 --> 19:13.570]  And just see this table cracked in half and the knocked out guy.
[19:13.710 --> 19:15.850]  And then it escalating into a brawl.
[19:16.290 --> 19:17.110]  So much fun.
[19:17.450 --> 19:18.390]  I laughed so hard.
[19:18.430 --> 19:18.970]  Did you clip it?
[19:19.170 --> 19:19.850]  I didn't clip it.
[19:19.910 --> 19:20.730]  I should have clipped it.
[19:20.790 --> 19:24.550]  But I was just so it was so unexpected to punch a dude so hard.
[19:24.550 --> 19:26.130]  I've never hit someone so hard in a game.
[19:26.250 --> 19:27.430]  They went through a table.
[19:27.650 --> 19:29.050]  It just felt so good.
[19:29.290 --> 19:31.710]  We should watch you stream it on one of the stream days.
[19:31.990 --> 19:32.750]  That'd be fun.
[19:32.750 --> 19:33.510]  Comment over it.
[19:33.650 --> 19:34.310]  I'd love to see.
[19:34.570 --> 19:36.470]  I yeah, I finished it, unfortunately.
[19:36.870 --> 19:39.090]  But I would love to see one of you guys.
[19:39.250 --> 19:41.270]  Yeah, like watch Nick play it or something or Gavin.
[19:41.350 --> 19:44.370]  Yeah, as somebody who doesn't care about Indiana Jones at all.
[19:44.430 --> 19:47.710]  It has me wanting to watch all of those movies because I haven't seen.
[19:47.790 --> 19:48.870]  I don't think any of the good ones.
[19:49.030 --> 19:50.450]  First three are fantastic.
[19:50.450 --> 19:55.870]  I've seen Crystal Skull and the Temple one.
[19:56.430 --> 19:57.330]  The second one, I think.
[19:57.750 --> 19:59.390]  Temple of Doom.
[19:59.730 --> 20:00.610]  Yeah, this movie sucks.
[20:00.970 --> 20:01.330]  What's that?
[20:01.650 --> 20:02.410]  Temple of Doom sucks.
[20:02.690 --> 20:03.410]  It doesn't suck.
[20:03.470 --> 20:04.090]  It's just not great.
[20:04.310 --> 20:05.610]  I feel like people don't like Temple of Doom.
[20:05.790 --> 20:07.370]  It's still better than the new shit.
[20:07.550 --> 20:09.090]  It's still worth watching.
[20:09.530 --> 20:11.330]  Kali Ma and all that stuff's fucking great.
[20:11.490 --> 20:12.070]  I like one and three.
[20:12.530 --> 20:13.330]  One and three.
[20:13.510 --> 20:16.010]  I'd go one, three, two and then no point in the others.
[20:16.630 --> 20:19.730]  I was about to ask, is the most recent one worth watching?
[20:19.730 --> 20:21.370]  The only one I have access to.
[20:21.710 --> 20:23.730]  The Dial of Destiny, I think it's called.
[20:23.830 --> 20:24.510]  That's what it's called, yeah.
[20:24.750 --> 20:26.690]  That property doesn't feel like it hits the same,
[20:26.770 --> 20:29.510]  but I'm really hoping that the game adds some life to it.
[20:29.590 --> 20:31.350]  It's incredible what they did with that game.
[20:31.790 --> 20:33.610]  It's so much fun to just run around and throw shit.
[20:33.790 --> 20:35.850]  I mean, I know it's incredibly old at this point,
[20:35.970 --> 20:41.490]  but I can't imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark not being phenomenal on a first watch, you know?
[20:41.570 --> 20:44.110]  I imagine you'll absolutely love it.
[20:44.270 --> 20:48.170]  I've seen the beginning of it and it was funny watching the beginning,
[20:48.590 --> 20:52.670]  knowing who Alfred Molina is, but not knowing the movie and being like,
[20:52.790 --> 20:54.650]  oh, he's in this, he's going to be around a while.
[20:55.110 --> 20:57.110]  And he has essentially no role and dies immediately.
[20:57.750 --> 20:59.530]  He gets a spike through his head, doesn't he?
[20:59.590 --> 21:00.270]  Yeah, he does.
[21:00.610 --> 21:00.870]  Yeah.
[21:01.110 --> 21:03.270]  It's surprisingly gruesome for like a PG movie.
[21:03.410 --> 21:03.690]  Yeah.
[21:03.890 --> 21:04.370]  Is it PG?
[21:04.630 --> 21:04.810]  Yeah.
[21:05.070 --> 21:05.470]  Interesting.
[21:05.710 --> 21:07.410]  That was the 80s, man. You could be gruesome.
[21:07.630 --> 21:07.810]  Yeah.
[21:08.070 --> 21:10.730]  I don't think PG-13 had been invented yet, had it?
[21:10.890 --> 21:11.430]  I assume not.
[21:11.790 --> 21:15.010]  What was the first PG-13 movie? I feel like we've talked about this before.
[21:15.330 --> 21:15.870]  I think we have.
[21:16.630 --> 21:17.030]  Fuck.
[21:17.030 --> 21:21.290]  First PG-13 movie is Red Dawn.
[21:21.730 --> 21:21.770]  Yeah.
[21:22.130 --> 21:23.190]  December of 1984.
[21:23.590 --> 21:24.030]  Red Dawn.
[21:24.430 --> 21:25.550]  I haven't seen that.
[21:25.690 --> 21:28.450]  You know when dudes are about to fight sometimes and they,
[21:28.470 --> 21:31.550]  they just like square up on each other and they get real close.
[21:31.610 --> 21:33.590]  It looks like they're like close enough to kiss each other.
[21:33.770 --> 21:34.090]  Yes.
[21:34.190 --> 21:38.330]  Where does that come from? Are people doing that because they've seen it in films?
[21:38.430 --> 21:43.730]  Or is it just a leftover piece of natural instinct from like animal behavior?
[21:44.030 --> 21:45.930]  I think it's genetic. I think it's natural instinct.
[21:46.250 --> 21:46.430]  Yeah.
[21:46.430 --> 21:49.910]  It's weird to see. It's weird to see that it's real and happens in real life,
[21:50.010 --> 21:50.690]  because I've never done it.
[21:50.870 --> 21:54.210]  Well, like the stare down, like the hold me back kind of like pre-fight.
[21:54.250 --> 21:57.950]  Yeah, just like get it right, like an inch away from someone's face,
[21:57.970 --> 21:59.310]  and like talking at them and that.
[21:59.450 --> 22:01.110]  Yeah, that's an interesting question of,
[22:01.430 --> 22:04.970]  because like obviously that's such a thing in competitive fighting.
[22:05.450 --> 22:08.790]  The stare down. But was the stare down the catalyst to that?
[22:08.910 --> 22:11.390]  Or was, was it just, do you understand what I'm saying?
[22:11.490 --> 22:15.630]  Like, was it natural? Like, is it, is it in our past to want to do that?
[22:15.630 --> 22:19.430]  Like, is that impressive? Because it is something in our DNA from the past.
[22:19.710 --> 22:23.710]  Well, like animals front on each other like that. And before they headbutt and all that.
[22:23.950 --> 22:24.490]  That's true.
[22:25.590 --> 22:26.530]  That's a good point.
[22:27.110 --> 22:28.450]  People just get so close.
[22:29.010 --> 22:31.630]  They like, yeah, gorillas posture up too.
[22:32.390 --> 22:37.050]  And it's like, I don't know how true this is, but I read somewhere on the internet years ago that
[22:37.050 --> 22:43.750]  like the reason we find people tripping and falling funny is because evolutionarily it
[22:43.750 --> 22:47.890]  releases an endorphin of relief because evolutionarily when we were all like
[22:47.890 --> 22:51.890]  running from saber-toothed tigers, if somebody tripped and fell, that meant you were safe.
[22:59.110 --> 23:03.110]  But other stuff that couldn't have been anywhere near animal related is still funny.
[23:03.270 --> 23:06.310]  It's true. It's true. Who knows if that's true? It's just a funny thing to think about.
[23:06.610 --> 23:12.010]  I must really enjoy feeling safe because I will just search person falling.
[23:12.010 --> 23:15.990]  I'd like to know what the caveman version of a guy getting hit in the
[23:15.990 --> 23:20.770]  balls with a skateboard or a football is because that's that's my sweet spot.
[23:22.090 --> 23:25.210]  Oh, I saw a great one of a woman that was
[23:25.210 --> 23:29.630]  like leaning out of a train for like an artistic video, like a shot.
[23:29.770 --> 23:31.890]  And then she got hit by a tree, like a branch.
[23:31.930 --> 23:35.530]  I watched it 50 times this morning, dude.
[23:35.770 --> 23:36.370]  She lived?
[23:36.710 --> 23:37.190]  Oh, yeah.
[23:37.470 --> 23:37.950]  Unclear.
[23:38.490 --> 23:39.530]  Oh, I'm assuming.
[23:39.530 --> 23:42.670]  Oh, I'm sure she's fine.
[23:42.950 --> 23:43.670]  Do you have the clip?
[23:43.850 --> 23:46.970]  It's not at the ready, but yeah, I think I sent it to Emily.
[23:47.050 --> 23:47.910]  I'll look for it and send it to you.
[23:48.090 --> 23:49.290]  I mean, anyone falling is great.
[23:49.570 --> 23:50.530]  Whenever there's a new fall.
[23:50.690 --> 23:54.830]  Was it Olivia Rodrigo that had that great fall recently where she just fell on the stage?
[23:55.390 --> 23:56.490]  Did you see that one, Gavin?
[23:56.710 --> 23:57.330]  I don't think so.
[23:57.690 --> 24:01.490]  There's like a stage door still open and she was like walking on,
[24:01.590 --> 24:05.570]  like she was singing and walking and just fell into the hole hard down.
[24:05.710 --> 24:06.570]  Who left the hole open?
[24:06.790 --> 24:07.830]  Somebody who used to work there.
[24:08.950 --> 24:10.530]  Josh Hartnett had to try to escape.
[24:10.710 --> 24:11.510]  It was a whole trap thing.
[24:11.590 --> 24:11.970]  He's a killer.
[24:12.450 --> 24:13.750]  That movie bums me out.
[24:13.810 --> 24:15.490]  I think more than any movie I've seen this year.
[24:15.910 --> 24:16.410]  It's upsetting.
[24:16.570 --> 24:17.250]  I still haven't seen it.
[24:17.490 --> 24:19.170]  Finally, somebody else agrees.
[24:19.630 --> 24:20.610]  I've always agreed.
[24:20.890 --> 24:25.230]  Like number one with a bullet on most disappointing movie of the year.
[24:25.330 --> 24:30.750]  Now that it's on like a rentable platform, I get clips of it on TikTok occasionally.
[24:31.030 --> 24:34.090]  And it's all the scenes before that movie goes bad.
[24:34.390 --> 24:36.910]  And it is so disappointing to be like, oh, this is.
[24:36.910 --> 24:41.090]  I remember watching this movie in the moment and not realizing how bad it was going to be.
[24:41.390 --> 24:43.330]  Really enjoying it at this stage.
[24:43.530 --> 24:45.030]  Oh, such a waste.
[24:45.350 --> 24:45.970]  What a dumb.
[24:46.750 --> 24:48.070]  That movie fucking sucks.
[24:48.250 --> 24:50.050]  Ultimately, I guess I'm just never going to know.
[24:50.270 --> 24:52.250]  Like with most of his films, you should see.
[24:52.650 --> 24:53.550]  No, I'm good.
[24:53.770 --> 24:54.330]  So good.
[24:54.630 --> 24:55.330]  And then it's not.
[24:55.710 --> 24:59.530]  It might be the movie that hits the highest talking about ranges, bagel ranges.
[25:00.070 --> 25:02.970]  That movie, I think, hits like an eight and ends up at a two.
[25:03.250 --> 25:03.670]  Oh, wow.
[25:03.810 --> 25:04.670]  That's a big swing.
[25:04.670 --> 25:05.090]  Yeah.
[25:05.250 --> 25:07.390]  I mean, that's definitely how it feels to it.
[25:07.430 --> 25:09.570]  Like and there's a moment where it happens and it's very sad.
[25:09.750 --> 25:11.710]  Does he escape in a spaceship or something?
[25:11.950 --> 25:14.070]  That would be cooler than what would be so awesome.
[25:14.270 --> 25:16.570]  Oh, my God, that would be fucking rad compared to what happens.
[25:19.810 --> 25:22.850]  I've been I've been thinking about getting into Sarsaparilla.
[25:23.830 --> 25:24.190]  Sarsaparilla?
[25:24.390 --> 25:28.030]  Yeah, I had some up in when I was in Branson and it was I've been thinking about it and
[25:28.030 --> 25:29.670]  I can't get it here.
[25:29.710 --> 25:30.330]  I don't see it anywhere.
[25:30.370 --> 25:32.410]  I went to World Market, figured they definitely have it.
[25:32.430 --> 25:33.030]  They don't have shit.
[25:33.030 --> 25:36.290]  And and now because I can't find it, I want it a lot.
[25:36.450 --> 25:37.170]  And I think it's a drink.
[25:37.570 --> 25:38.950]  Yeah, it's kind of like root beer.
[25:39.130 --> 25:40.330]  It's essentially root beer.
[25:40.510 --> 25:43.330]  I don't know that it's different in any way than root beer.
[25:43.570 --> 25:45.530]  Yeah, it is like I think it's root beer.
[25:45.610 --> 25:48.390]  It's just like a different root, like a slightly different root.
[25:48.670 --> 25:50.070]  I just I think that's all it is.
[25:50.170 --> 25:51.730]  But it's fun to say Sarsaparilla.
[25:52.470 --> 25:58.570]  And the brand I had was Sioux City Sarsaparilla, which is even more fun to say, you know, three
[25:58.570 --> 25:59.310]  hard S's.
[25:59.430 --> 26:00.090]  It's pretty good.
[26:00.090 --> 26:03.830]  And so I want to get some if anybody knows where I can get some Sioux City Sarsaparilla
[26:03.830 --> 26:06.370]  in Austin around these parts, you let me know, Cowpoke.
[26:08.750 --> 26:12.330]  That's what you drink in Fallout New Vegas is Sunset Sarsaparilla.
[26:12.570 --> 26:13.470]  And I always thought that was cool.
[26:13.630 --> 26:14.690]  Yeah, I don't remember that.
[26:14.730 --> 26:15.010]  That's cool.
[26:15.290 --> 26:16.510]  I want to play New Vegas again.
[26:16.630 --> 26:17.270]  Oh, New Vegas.
[26:17.470 --> 26:18.290]  That's the best one.
[26:18.310 --> 26:19.310]  It's just the best one.
[26:19.510 --> 26:20.550]  It's the best one.
[26:20.570 --> 26:21.770]  It's because it's the only one they didn't make.
[26:22.510 --> 26:23.230]  Hey, honestly.
[26:23.370 --> 26:25.090]  Yeah, thanks, Obsidian.
[26:25.870 --> 26:28.350]  Yeah, I found a place where you can order it.
[26:28.350 --> 26:30.310]  But it's just online.
[26:30.430 --> 26:30.870]  Sorry, Geoff.
[26:31.010 --> 26:31.890]  It's not the same.
[26:31.990 --> 26:37.070]  You know, you want to hitch your horse up to a post and saddle on in and order a fresh one
[26:37.070 --> 26:38.030]  right off the tap.
[26:38.990 --> 26:42.730]  Oh, if you could install a tap in your house that could dispense any drink, what would
[26:42.730 --> 26:43.710]  it be in your house?
[26:43.970 --> 26:44.990]  Well, today it'd be Sarsaparilla.
[26:46.430 --> 26:47.690]  Probably cold brew coffee.
[26:49.850 --> 26:52.670]  You would drink way too much of that if it came out of a tap.
[26:52.890 --> 26:56.350]  It would be it would be such an issue for my day to day life.
[26:56.350 --> 26:59.390]  But boy, what a ride those two weeks would be.
[27:02.390 --> 27:07.370]  Yeah, I feel like the the effort involved in coffee keeps people from OD'ing on caffeine.
[27:07.610 --> 27:11.370]  Oh, I've had two cups today and I want to make another one, but we're not going to have
[27:11.370 --> 27:14.890]  time in between stuff because it just takes a little too long.
[27:15.150 --> 27:16.070]  How long does it take?
[27:16.230 --> 27:16.850]  I can give you time.
[27:17.490 --> 27:18.090]  Oh, no, no, no.
[27:18.090 --> 27:19.390]  Because I'm just curious.
[27:19.630 --> 27:20.230]  I'm just curious.
[27:20.290 --> 27:20.990]  No, I understand that.
[27:21.010 --> 27:22.570]  I'm just curious about how long it takes.
[27:22.710 --> 27:24.230]  Uh, to like heat the water and everything.
[27:24.230 --> 27:26.750]  I just need like 10 minutes to like feel comfortable making it.
[27:27.130 --> 27:30.730]  Well, I'm going to need about 15 minutes to take the dog out of the bathroom
[27:31.150 --> 27:33.290]  because he's going to need to pee after two podcasts.
[27:33.570 --> 27:35.630]  So do what you will with that time.
[27:35.830 --> 27:41.250]  It's just it's that thing where it's just just the amount of time is like, oh, maybe.
[27:41.770 --> 27:42.990]  But boy, I'm almost out of beans.
[27:43.110 --> 27:43.650]  It's a whole thing.
[27:43.830 --> 27:44.510]  It's just a whole thing.
[27:44.830 --> 27:45.790]  What about Nick and Andrew?
[27:45.910 --> 27:46.870]  What would be in your taps?
[27:47.050 --> 27:48.650]  I think I know myself too well.
[27:49.310 --> 27:53.090]  It would be, as Eric said, a problem to have like a soda or something.
[27:53.090 --> 27:57.610]  I think I'd just go with like a sparkling water, maybe like an orange bubble.
[27:58.810 --> 27:59.490]  Diet Pepsi.
[28:00.550 --> 28:03.990]  Oh, man, I almost like similar to Eric's, the cold brew coffee.
[28:04.110 --> 28:08.850]  But I think I would go with something that's more of like, would I go with a dark beer?
[28:09.170 --> 28:10.010]  This is great.
[28:10.110 --> 28:14.430]  We're all playing pretend and Nick is treating it like he has to make a decision for what's
[28:14.430 --> 28:15.250]  about to go in his heart.
[28:15.330 --> 28:16.250]  I appreciate that, though.
[28:16.310 --> 28:18.550]  I'm glad he's not just shitting out a meaningless answer.
[28:18.930 --> 28:20.210]  Thanks for really caring.
[28:20.210 --> 28:24.870]  To be clear, you're installing this in your house and you can't change it.
[28:24.950 --> 28:26.030]  And it's permanently there.
[28:26.790 --> 28:32.230]  So then if you're going to sell your home at some point, you need to factor in that
[28:32.230 --> 28:33.550]  this is part of your house.
[28:34.110 --> 28:34.510]  Yes.
[28:34.710 --> 28:35.810]  Put a vase over it or something.
[28:36.270 --> 28:38.330]  I fucking, that's a selling point.
[28:38.410 --> 28:40.730]  You know how many people were interested in that stupid pizza oven?
[28:40.810 --> 28:41.930]  This is the same thing.
[28:43.950 --> 28:46.790]  Oh, people liked your house because of the pizza place?
[28:47.050 --> 28:47.730]  Yeah, dude.
[28:47.910 --> 28:49.510]  That was a fucking, I heard about it a bunch.
[28:49.510 --> 28:51.730]  Tony shouldn't have demolished it.
[28:51.970 --> 28:52.930]  Well, I didn't, did I?
[28:53.150 --> 28:53.650]  I sold it.
[28:54.710 --> 29:01.430]  Fucking, instead of a pizza oven, it's got a, you know, open floor plan, high ceilings,
[29:01.770 --> 29:02.330]  sarsaparilla tap.
[29:02.650 --> 29:03.290]  They're going to be all over.
[29:05.690 --> 29:07.470]  Would you lead with sarsaparilla tap?
[29:08.530 --> 29:11.130]  sarsaparilla tap, two bedroom, three bathroom.
[29:12.590 --> 29:13.130]  Four tap.
[29:13.350 --> 29:15.910]  The upstairs sarsaparilla tap is the real Rari.
[29:15.910 --> 29:20.930]  This is a funny thing, but we saw the TV show Hacks, and in the TV show Hacks,
[29:21.030 --> 29:25.370]  the main character has a soda machine in her house like you had at the, like a McDonald's,
[29:25.430 --> 29:26.350]  you know, like a full one.
[29:26.630 --> 29:32.810]  And Emily, once she saw that that's an option, has, it is number one on her list of when we
[29:32.810 --> 29:36.470]  buy the Michigan house that's going to have a basement in it, because all Michigan homes
[29:36.470 --> 29:36.950]  have basements.
[29:37.170 --> 29:40.090]  The first thing she's installing, she's already looked into it.
[29:40.170 --> 29:41.310]  They're, they're affordable.
[29:41.610 --> 29:43.150]  She's found companies that do it.
[29:43.150 --> 29:46.170]  She's installing a soda thing in our basement.
[29:46.390 --> 29:50.430]  Could you just, if you had, I mean, obviously, if you have the money, you can, enough money,
[29:50.490 --> 29:51.090]  you can do whatever.
[29:51.650 --> 29:54.510]  But how accessible is a Coke freestyle machine?
[29:55.090 --> 29:56.750]  That's a great question.
[29:57.010 --> 29:59.810]  You have to have like a business license to have one.
[29:59.930 --> 30:01.130]  Like, you have to be an establishment.
[30:01.490 --> 30:04.850]  Can you just recreationally buy a freestyle machine?
[30:04.950 --> 30:06.270]  But like, why the freestyle?
[30:06.490 --> 30:08.650]  Geoff only wants Diet Coke.
[30:08.810 --> 30:09.450]  You know what I mean?
[30:09.770 --> 30:12.630]  It's just, it's the jukebox of the soda world.
[30:13.150 --> 30:14.970]  I like having the variety of choices.
[30:15.050 --> 30:15.430]  How's it work?
[30:15.490 --> 30:17.610]  Is it like a guy come by and just fill it up with syrups?
[30:17.850 --> 30:18.230]  Yeah.
[30:18.450 --> 30:19.550]  Or you can buy your own syrup.
[30:19.890 --> 30:20.650]  You probably do it yourself.
[30:21.030 --> 30:23.110]  They have smaller countertop units for 21k.
[30:23.370 --> 30:23.770]  Jesus.
[30:24.050 --> 30:24.450]  Jesus.
[30:25.350 --> 30:26.690]  That is expensive.
[30:27.030 --> 30:28.310]  Man, that's why you don't see them very often.
[30:29.610 --> 30:32.590]  Why don't they have them just in the, in the street?
[30:33.830 --> 30:34.930]  A vending machine?
[30:35.090 --> 30:35.890]  Are you at what?
[30:36.150 --> 30:39.690]  Nah, like, you know how there's like public water fountains just out?
[30:40.270 --> 30:42.690]  Why doesn't every road just have...
[30:42.690 --> 30:43.650]  Like a 7up fountain?
[30:43.990 --> 30:45.970]  Yeah, you just pick what you want and go up to it.
[30:46.190 --> 30:47.650]  And it's just like all the houses share it.
[30:47.770 --> 30:48.530]  Who pays for it?
[30:48.610 --> 30:50.230]  I don't know, who pays for a power pole?
[30:51.410 --> 30:52.350]  So you want...
[30:52.350 --> 30:53.050]  Who pays for a water fountain?
[30:53.510 --> 30:56.290]  Hang on, you want the Coke freestyle machine to come out of our taxes?
[30:59.990 --> 31:00.310]  Well...
[31:00.310 --> 31:01.470]  That'd be neat.
[31:01.610 --> 31:02.670]  You don't need one in your house.
[31:03.150 --> 31:04.370]  You just walk outside.
[31:04.510 --> 31:05.730]  You don't have to take a little stroll, get a...
[31:05.730 --> 31:07.950]  Yeah, you walk outside, you shave, and then you...
[31:08.810 --> 31:09.830]  Go get your 7up?
[31:11.410 --> 31:13.410]  You go to the communal shave hall?
[31:14.070 --> 31:16.610]  Fill up your neighborhood beard box and then go...
[31:17.730 --> 31:19.670]  Get a bucket of Diet Pepsi.
[31:20.110 --> 31:23.650]  I don't know, there's so much stuff that could so easily be shared.
[31:23.850 --> 31:24.930]  It's like the town well.
[31:28.070 --> 31:29.390]  Oh no, watch out, Timmy!
[31:30.810 --> 31:32.510]  Timmy fell in the mountain do well!
[31:32.930 --> 31:35.650]  Gavin just discovered hippie communes and he's all about it.
[31:35.990 --> 31:36.210]  Yep.
[31:37.630 --> 31:38.350]  That's cool.
[31:38.610 --> 31:41.250]  But if it was treated well, I think it'd be fine.
[31:41.430 --> 31:42.290]  Isn't that most things?
[31:42.510 --> 31:45.110]  Dude, guys, listen, if nothing happened to it, nothing would happen to it.
[31:45.250 --> 31:45.510]  It's great.
[31:46.450 --> 31:47.310]  If it was treated well.
[31:47.510 --> 31:48.350]  Put it next to a mailbox.
[31:48.710 --> 31:52.230]  That's just the equivalent of would be good if done right.
[31:52.510 --> 31:54.070]  It's like, well, yeah, why would you do it wrong?
[31:55.390 --> 31:58.110]  A soda well would be a problem because the carbonation, right?
[31:58.230 --> 32:00.370]  You need to have something constantly carbonating it.
[32:00.430 --> 32:03.110]  It'd be like a giant soda stream that was constantly like...
[32:04.750 --> 32:08.930]  Yeah, I feel like most of the unit would be a CO2 canister.
[32:09.430 --> 32:13.250]  While digging my well, I accidentally nicked a CO2 pipe.
[32:16.330 --> 32:18.390]  I want to start. I think we should start one.
[32:18.550 --> 32:20.450]  All we need to do is weatherproof one of these machines.
[32:20.890 --> 32:22.450]  Dude, that'd be the fucking worst.
[32:22.930 --> 32:26.290]  You dig it in your backyard and you don't call the city first and you nick the fucking
[32:26.290 --> 32:29.370]  soda line and you end up putting mud in everybody's soda line.
[32:29.690 --> 32:32.590]  And then everybody in the fucking town hates you because you got to flush it out.
[32:33.550 --> 32:35.430]  Why is my mud all bubbly?
[32:36.730 --> 32:37.690]  You just see someone...
[32:37.690 --> 32:38.110]  Carbonated mud.
[32:38.810 --> 32:42.790]  You just see someone leant over on their front lawn looking like Mr. Freeze has just got
[32:42.790 --> 32:44.750]  to nick the CO2 line.
[32:45.250 --> 32:50.470]  In Austin, in Austin fucking Texas, it would work for two years and then you'd be like,
[32:50.610 --> 32:51.850]  why does it taste like this?
[32:51.870 --> 32:55.230]  And they'd be like, oh yeah, there's zebra mollusks in the Pepsi again.
[32:55.450 --> 32:56.870]  We can't get rid of them.
[32:57.270 --> 33:00.270]  It'll be like this every three years forever until it gets worse.
[33:01.290 --> 33:01.730]  Hmm.
[33:01.870 --> 33:03.490]  I hate the idea of a soda well.
[33:03.610 --> 33:08.090]  If you're not from Austin, we have these things called zebra mollusks that they literally
[33:08.090 --> 33:13.650]  cannot remove for some reason, and they just make our water taste like fish for like three
[33:13.650 --> 33:16.170]  weeks and you got to boil it for like, I don't know, every couple of years.
[33:16.430 --> 33:18.470]  I just, you should just do that anyway with Austin water.
[33:18.710 --> 33:20.570]  Yeah, Austin water is not good to have.
[33:20.830 --> 33:21.330]  Rancid stuff.
[33:21.490 --> 33:21.810]  Terrible.
[33:22.210 --> 33:23.010]  Piece of shit.
[33:24.510 --> 33:25.610]  Ain't no soda well.
[33:26.850 --> 33:27.330]  Say that much.
[33:27.330 --> 33:27.530]  Soda well.
[33:28.050 --> 33:29.370]  Let's, let's register that company.
[33:29.370 --> 33:30.530]  I think it'll be big.
[33:31.290 --> 33:33.470]  Somebody spike the soda well with root beer.
[33:33.730 --> 33:35.030]  This fucking sucks.
[33:36.130 --> 33:38.210]  Just put one at the back of every cul-de-sac.
[33:38.610 --> 33:39.810]  Are you a neighbors guy, Gavin?
[33:39.890 --> 33:40.990]  Do you like knowing your neighbors?
[33:41.350 --> 33:42.690]  Like interacting with your neighbors?
[33:43.530 --> 33:44.330]  Uh, no.
[33:45.250 --> 33:47.350]  And this seems like a terrible thing to lead.
[33:47.650 --> 33:49.350]  Well, soda well for everybody.
[33:49.650 --> 33:50.450]  The communal well.
[33:50.670 --> 33:52.490]  Maybe it would help me get involved in the community.
[33:52.790 --> 33:53.190]  Wow.
[33:53.510 --> 33:56.090]  Are you just trying to figure out who the cucumber lady is?
[33:56.190 --> 33:57.230]  Are you trying to track her down?
[33:58.050 --> 34:02.370]  Maybe this will get me involved in the community.
[34:08.030 --> 34:11.710]  I sat idly by until the soda well.
[34:12.710 --> 34:15.350]  And I realized it's time for me to make a change.
[34:15.670 --> 34:18.710]  This, this reminds me of a conversation I had with Emily recently where
[34:18.710 --> 34:21.690]  I drove through my old neighborhood where I sold, you know, where I sold the house
[34:21.690 --> 34:23.550]  that I had lived at for six years.
[34:24.050 --> 34:26.430]  And I felt kind of sad.
[34:26.430 --> 34:29.810]  I hadn't experienced this before, but I felt kind of sad because there was like
[34:29.810 --> 34:33.050]  nobody to wave at or no like neighbor friends.
[34:33.170 --> 34:37.570]  And I realized that when we moved, I didn't say goodbye to a single neighbor.
[34:37.570 --> 34:39.710]  And a single neighbor didn't say goodbye to me.
[34:39.910 --> 34:41.110]  And I was telling Emily about it.
[34:41.130 --> 34:45.130]  And I was like, I just felt kind of like we lived there for six years and didn't really
[34:45.130 --> 34:49.090]  leave a mark or matter or know anybody or make any kind of an imprint.
[34:49.190 --> 34:52.210]  So when you leave, it feels like you were never there, you know?
[34:52.210 --> 34:53.390]  And it just kind of bums me out.
[34:53.410 --> 34:56.110]  And she was like, well, maybe you should make an effort with our current neighbors
[34:56.110 --> 34:58.550]  and I was like, what the fuck are you thinking?
[34:58.790 --> 34:59.490]  Oh, my God.
[34:59.730 --> 35:02.970]  And then I realized how much I don't care about that other thing,
[35:02.970 --> 35:04.850]  because it would mean I'd have to talk to people.
[35:06.770 --> 35:10.270]  Reminds me of when I think if you if you could get in and out without leaving a mark,
[35:10.290 --> 35:10.990]  I think you've done it right.
[35:11.190 --> 35:11.810]  Yeah, man.
[35:12.210 --> 35:14.030]  I don't know most of the name.
[35:14.290 --> 35:17.670]  The people across the street for me, I didn't know their names for six years.
[35:18.570 --> 35:25.090]  I remember saying goodbye to my old neighbor who lived next door to a house where some
[35:25.090 --> 35:26.250]  crazy shit happened.
[35:26.450 --> 35:30.010]  And I said, sorry for being the worst neighbors in the world.
[35:30.250 --> 35:32.630]  And he said it was real interesting.
[35:38.960 --> 35:41.040]  You're worse than the crazy shit that happened.
[35:42.140 --> 35:45.680]  Dude, I feel like I would much rather never have a conversation than have to
[35:45.680 --> 35:47.520]  carry that one around for the rest of my life.
[35:49.360 --> 35:51.180]  It was real interesting.
[35:51.440 --> 35:52.120]  Oh, man.
[35:52.800 --> 35:55.780]  I'll be thinking about that at 1 a.m. for the next 30 years.
[35:58.080 --> 36:00.660]  How often do they think about how interesting it was?
[36:01.440 --> 36:04.840]  How much did they enjoy the interest that you generated for them?
[36:05.160 --> 36:06.120]  Like, interesting isn't good.
[36:06.300 --> 36:07.820]  If it was good, he would have said good.
[36:08.040 --> 36:10.340]  Interesting was like the nicest way he could say it.
[36:10.420 --> 36:10.720]  Yeah.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.400]  It's the least offensive thing he could think of to say.
[36:13.600 --> 36:17.080]  I was fully expecting just a generic, you know, no worries man or
[36:18.140 --> 36:19.700]  don't be a stranger or whatever.
[36:20.260 --> 36:20.460]  Yeah.
[36:21.080 --> 36:22.840]  Well, I'm assuming it's slow-mo stuff, right?
[36:23.020 --> 36:23.920]  That was the cause of...
[36:23.920 --> 36:24.800]  Ah!
[36:26.120 --> 36:26.600]  No!
[36:26.900 --> 36:27.320]  Okay.
[36:30.120 --> 36:31.640]  Because that's a good interesting.
[36:32.140 --> 36:35.580]  It's like you're blowing shit up next door and filming in slow motion.
[36:36.440 --> 36:37.380]  Very interesting.
[36:37.520 --> 36:39.720]  No, people are honestly usually keen with the slow-mo stuff.
[36:40.060 --> 36:40.480]  They're interested.
[36:40.660 --> 36:40.740]  Yeah.
[36:41.000 --> 36:42.740]  The other thing that they're not as keen on.
[36:47.480 --> 36:53.140]  I'm excited that when we're done with this podcast today, we're going to record a gameplay
[36:53.140 --> 36:55.420]  and I don't know when it's going to come out.
[36:55.420 --> 36:57.220]  I don't know if it's like a surprise or anything.
[36:57.400 --> 36:58.520]  Does anybody have any opinions on that?
[36:58.720 --> 36:59.980]  It should come out before the end of the year.
[37:01.120 --> 37:02.580]  I bet it doesn't.
[37:02.860 --> 37:04.120]  Yeah, I bet it doesn't as well.
[37:04.260 --> 37:05.100]  Well, I don't know.
[37:05.260 --> 37:06.080]  You think you're...
[37:06.080 --> 37:07.440]  I think maybe you're insane.
[37:08.940 --> 37:13.220]  Well, I mean, it's technically a part of a series that always comes out this time of year.
[37:13.480 --> 37:19.420]  Well, it's a start of a new tradition where we film it in the correct month and then we
[37:19.420 --> 37:21.480]  release it when we're able to.
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.500]  That's been a tradition for six good months right now of that tradition.
[37:26.880 --> 37:31.080]  You don't think we could record and upload a video within a two week window?
[37:31.520 --> 37:32.860]  It's not that it's...
[37:32.860 --> 37:36.940]  First of all, it's a two week window and a time in which people are the least available
[37:36.940 --> 37:37.980]  of the year.
[37:38.480 --> 37:41.220]  Second of all, we already have stuff scheduled.
[37:41.480 --> 37:42.860]  We're scheduled for the rest of the year.
[37:42.960 --> 37:43.660]  You were in the meeting.
[37:43.840 --> 37:46.580]  It was a very big point that I made about scheduling to the end of the year.
[37:46.580 --> 37:52.300]  We can shuffle stuff, but two major holidays in the next two weeks is going to really get
[37:52.300 --> 37:53.080]  in the way of...
[37:53.080 --> 37:55.340]  Yeah, and the day that this is released is Christmas.
[37:55.760 --> 38:00.240]  And I would argue the third thing is that this is a completely different interpretation
[38:00.960 --> 38:02.440]  of a thing.
[38:02.880 --> 38:05.060]  It's not like it's the exact same thing.
[38:05.320 --> 38:06.120]  It's not a one to one.
[38:06.360 --> 38:07.560]  Different thing.
[38:07.740 --> 38:10.260]  It's like a thematic or thematic sequel.
[38:10.580 --> 38:11.520]  Yeah, real different.
[38:12.020 --> 38:14.600]  Well, it's in a completely different game.
[38:15.880 --> 38:17.440]  With different people.
[38:18.720 --> 38:20.020]  Well, anyway, if you're...
[38:20.020 --> 38:22.300]  You're real fucking different, man.
[38:22.400 --> 38:25.700]  If this sounds interesting to you, keep an eye out.
[38:25.900 --> 38:32.140]  If it's sometime in the undefined nearest future, probably 2025, a video may come out
[38:32.140 --> 38:37.640]  that may or may not be a spiritual successor to another thing or identical to it.
[38:37.700 --> 38:38.820]  You'll just have to wait and see.
[38:38.860 --> 38:41.360]  I understand that we're scheduled out.
[38:41.440 --> 38:44.460]  It's unlikely that it'll be done, but you're acting like it's completely impossible.
[38:44.460 --> 38:46.920]  It seems like an insane suggestion.
[38:47.000 --> 38:47.860]  I don't think it's insane.
[38:47.880 --> 38:49.640]  You're acting like it was going to happen.
[38:49.840 --> 38:50.840]  I know how to get it done.
[38:51.200 --> 38:52.240]  I know how to get it done.
[38:52.340 --> 38:53.380]  Gavin said the magic word.
[38:53.700 --> 38:54.780]  We just need to get Ethan Hunt.
[38:56.400 --> 38:57.600]  The impossible impossible.
[38:58.040 --> 38:59.220]  We need to get IMF involved.
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.960]  He ain't accepting that mission.
[39:01.380 --> 39:03.020]  He's going to listen to it and say, I'm good.
[39:03.320 --> 39:04.880]  Send it straight to the top.
[39:08.620 --> 39:11.080]  004 is going to come through and edit this thing for us.
[39:11.580 --> 39:15.520]  OK, now you're acting like this is the exact same thing.
[39:15.620 --> 39:19.020]  Is eating a meal with any group of people identical to you?
[39:19.140 --> 39:19.860]  This is great.
[39:19.980 --> 39:21.660]  This one to one that he's making.
[39:21.780 --> 39:22.700]  I'm so excited about.
[39:22.780 --> 39:23.060]  Go ahead.
[39:23.240 --> 39:24.380]  What did you just say?
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.640]  So you we are you're you're like, oh, it's completely the same.
[39:30.180 --> 39:33.880]  We're playing a different game and it's different people involved in it.
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.960]  The only there's an act that's the same.
[39:36.960 --> 39:41.920]  So I'm saying like the act of eating dinner, although the same in concept,
[39:42.160 --> 39:45.740]  is wildly different depending on who you're eating it with.
[39:45.900 --> 39:48.560]  Yeah, but dinner is a long standing series.
[39:49.940 --> 39:51.720]  Dinner is a long standing series.
[39:52.120 --> 39:54.020]  I have dinner all the time on the reg.
[39:54.360 --> 39:57.540]  And I don't think we can't get that done by tonight.
[39:57.740 --> 39:59.160]  We're going to have to have dinner for breakfast.
[40:00.460 --> 40:01.920]  You've never had dinner for breakfast?
[40:04.080 --> 40:05.280]  You've never had a breakfast there?
[40:05.320 --> 40:06.140]  You've never flipped it up?
[40:07.180 --> 40:08.420]  The breakfast for dinner?
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.160]  I'm going to slide my slide. It's eight out of ten.
[40:10.500 --> 40:11.860]  Yeah, this is an eight out of ten, big time.
[40:13.180 --> 40:14.620]  It's just an insane.
[40:14.840 --> 40:17.940]  It's not insane to make a video that comes out.
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.180]  OK, are you having dinner every time at the exact same hour,
[40:22.320 --> 40:24.360]  the exact same minute, the exact same second?
[40:24.620 --> 40:27.740]  Are you not allowed to have dinner at nine o'clock one day
[40:27.740 --> 40:29.500]  and then seven o'clock another day?
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.700]  Dinner's still dinner.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.340]  Yeah, dinner's still happening.
[40:32.480 --> 40:33.100]  Anytime in the evening.
[40:33.180 --> 40:33.700]  That's what I'm saying.
[40:33.720 --> 40:35.420]  Anytime in this entire month.
[40:35.420 --> 40:38.560]  This entire month of two weeks, two weeks.
[40:38.860 --> 40:41.580]  There's 20, what, 19 days left in this month?
[40:41.940 --> 40:42.660]  Cut out weekends.
[40:43.020 --> 40:43.620]  Cut out weekends.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  18, 17, 16, 15. You got 15 days.
[40:47.960 --> 40:49.560]  OK, 15 days without weekends.
[40:49.940 --> 40:52.200]  You got Christmas. You got New Year's.
[40:52.440 --> 40:53.280]  Well, that's next month.
[40:53.520 --> 40:54.700]  Cut out Christmas Eve, please.
[40:54.840 --> 40:56.300]  I'm not making anybody work on Christmas Eve.
[40:56.480 --> 40:57.000]  Christmas Eve.
[40:57.100 --> 40:57.660]  I mean, that's cruel.
[40:57.880 --> 40:58.340]  10 days.
[40:58.600 --> 41:01.320]  It can't be done, but you seem to...
[41:02.100 --> 41:04.480]  It's the fact that you're acting like this is a tradition
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.120]  that needs to be upheld when I'm saying that I don't think it is part of the tradition.
[41:08.420 --> 41:12.780]  All right. It was just, you know, nice to have an end of year little summary, little something.
[41:12.960 --> 41:13.520]  I agree.
[41:13.760 --> 41:18.540]  And that's why we're going to do our best to get that video out in 2024.
[41:18.720 --> 41:21.760]  And when we don't, it'll be out in 2025.
[41:22.500 --> 41:23.880]  Yeah, I just want to rewind a little bit.
[41:23.900 --> 41:25.880]  So is dinner your favorite series or no?
[41:26.300 --> 41:27.640]  It's up there. That's a good one.
[41:28.540 --> 41:31.280]  What's the most important series of the day to get right?
[41:33.360 --> 41:35.100]  Because I feel like breakfast.
[41:36.860 --> 41:40.080]  I canceled breakfast years ago.
[41:45.140 --> 41:47.980]  Guys, I got big news. Lunch is being renewed.
[41:49.380 --> 41:55.740]  I like how each other's throats we are throughout the show in the most low stakes way possible.
[41:58.140 --> 42:01.100]  I don't think anything we've ever talked about matters.
[42:06.220 --> 42:08.900]  I'm at a 9.7 right now.
[42:08.900 --> 42:10.440]  This is the happiest I've been in a while.
[42:10.540 --> 42:14.860]  The most important series of the day was such a good line.
[42:15.260 --> 42:16.680]  God is so funny.
[42:17.900 --> 42:20.940]  Holy shit. You hear about the spinoff? It's called brunch.
[42:21.280 --> 42:22.620]  Fucking crazy.
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.660]  Mid-season pickup.
[42:28.760 --> 42:31.080]  I wish I would go back and do more dinner.
[42:31.080 --> 42:32.700]  I'm sick of all this brunch stuff.
[42:33.960 --> 42:37.280]  Oh, we're doing February? I hear this 28 episode run in February.
[42:37.580 --> 42:37.900]  Shit.
[42:38.860 --> 42:39.620]  Oh, it's a leap year?
[42:39.940 --> 42:44.940]  Oh, this is great.
[42:46.280 --> 42:48.320]  Speaking of getting a meal together, the other day,
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.340]  Eric and Nick and I got hot dogs together at a new place.
[42:51.420 --> 42:52.860]  What was that place called? Mad Dogs?
[42:53.580 --> 42:55.400]  I was jealous of those pictures coming in.
[42:55.620 --> 42:57.640]  I can tell from all the paper you're in the same place.
[42:57.800 --> 42:59.500]  So do we thumbs up or down that place?
[42:59.500 --> 43:02.140]  Is that a place we're promoting, condoning?
[43:02.360 --> 43:03.660]  I think it's good if you're around there.
[43:03.740 --> 43:05.800]  It's definitely like a late-night drunk spot.
[43:06.160 --> 43:10.460]  I mean, it's also hot dogs, so really, it wasn't going to be bad.
[43:10.540 --> 43:11.420]  It was pretty good. I liked it.
[43:11.740 --> 43:12.700]  Chili cheese fries were great.
[43:12.920 --> 43:15.840]  I think the chili cheese fries were better than the hot dogs, but the hot dogs were fine.
[43:16.040 --> 43:16.260]  Yeah.
[43:16.380 --> 43:16.580]  Yeah.
[43:17.060 --> 43:18.840]  Definitely worth checking out if you're over there.
[43:18.940 --> 43:22.280]  I wouldn't make a journey to get there or anything, but yeah.
[43:22.480 --> 43:23.700]  Did you guys talk about anything cool?
[43:24.740 --> 43:25.980]  What did we talk about?
[43:26.880 --> 43:28.440]  I don't know that it was anything cool.
[43:28.440 --> 43:31.460]  We just kind of like a lot of chatter, some work stuff.
[43:31.660 --> 43:32.800]  Figured out some different things.
[43:33.600 --> 43:35.240]  Yeah, I don't know. I thought it was nice.
[43:35.920 --> 43:39.700]  I pitched the boys on an idea that I pitched Andrew on recently.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.240]  Kind of threw that out there.
[43:42.500 --> 43:45.980]  Would you say that lunch is getting renewed based off of that experience?
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.800]  Yeah, I would like to renew.
[43:49.040 --> 43:50.020]  I would like to renew.
[43:50.660 --> 43:51.460]  Maybe in a...
[43:51.460 --> 43:55.880]  I don't know if it's considered the same series if we renew, but we go to a different location.
[43:56.460 --> 43:58.280]  Like if we shoot in a different location.
[43:58.440 --> 44:00.460]  I'd like to go to yesterday.
[44:00.680 --> 44:05.600]  I had not a damn chance burger and it's one of the best hamburgers I've had in a long time.
[44:05.740 --> 44:08.740]  And so if we were to have another lunch, I'd like to I'd like to do it.
[44:08.800 --> 44:09.980]  But I'd like to change.
[44:10.240 --> 44:14.460]  I don't know if it has to be a new series order or if we if it's considered as a part of the
[44:14.460 --> 44:15.820]  same lunch, but I'd like to have it there.
[44:16.040 --> 44:19.900]  How many consecutive lunches in a row does Gavin need to be part of to be bumped from
[44:19.900 --> 44:21.840]  a special guest to series regular?
[44:22.360 --> 44:22.700]  Six.
[44:23.520 --> 44:24.200]  Six, okay.
[44:26.520 --> 44:27.840]  Because I'd like to see him in the mix.
[44:27.840 --> 44:29.280]  I really enjoyed his one appearance.
[44:29.440 --> 44:30.280]  That is great.
[44:30.520 --> 44:32.100]  We'd all like to see him in the mix.
[44:32.220 --> 44:34.140]  Everyone would love to see him when he guests.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.520]  He's the most popular.
[44:35.620 --> 44:36.520]  Everybody loves to see it.
[44:36.860 --> 44:37.680]  Brightens everyone's day.
[44:37.760 --> 44:38.840]  And he needs to eat a hot dog.
[44:39.640 --> 44:40.680]  Easy to hot dog?
[44:41.100 --> 44:41.920]  No, he needs to eat a hot dog.
[44:41.920 --> 44:42.700]  He needs to eat a hot dog.
[44:42.900 --> 44:46.920]  We were talking about if you would have gotten a hot dog while we were there or because they
[44:46.920 --> 44:48.280]  had hamburgers and stuff, too.
[44:48.420 --> 44:50.500]  And we were just wondering if like you would have gotten a hot dog.
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.660]  I feel like if everyone else was dogging, I'd dog.
[44:52.980 --> 44:53.760]  I agree with that.
[44:54.180 --> 44:55.180]  That seems like the move.
[44:56.180 --> 44:56.900]  What's sarsaparilla?
[44:56.900 --> 44:57.520]  What?
[44:58.180 --> 44:58.300]  What?
[44:58.720 --> 45:00.620]  Somebody spelled sarsaparilla wrong.
[45:00.980 --> 45:01.280]  Oh, OK.
[45:01.380 --> 45:01.620]  I think.
[45:01.700 --> 45:02.340]  Was that told to us?
[45:03.560 --> 45:04.080]  Sarsaparilla?
[45:04.360 --> 45:05.580]  Sioux City sarsaparilla?
[45:05.940 --> 45:06.920]  No, it's sarsaparilla.
[45:07.540 --> 45:08.060]  Sarsaparilla.
[45:08.120 --> 45:09.760]  No, I don't think anybody mentioned sarsaparilla.
[45:10.020 --> 45:10.180]  OK.
[45:15.200 --> 45:16.580]  No fucking clue.
[45:16.840 --> 45:18.460]  I don't even know what we're talking about.
[45:18.960 --> 45:24.320]  Nick posted a Reddit thread in the discord where somebody was asking if where you can
[45:24.320 --> 45:25.580]  get sarsaparilla on tap.
[45:26.140 --> 45:29.860]  There's no useful info in there, by the way, but but they spelled sarsaparilla,
[45:30.140 --> 45:35.060]  s-a-r-s-a-p-a-r-i-l-l-a, sarsaparilla.
[45:35.540 --> 45:36.420]  I have a question for Gavin.
[45:36.700 --> 45:36.860]  OK.
[45:37.120 --> 45:37.900]  You went home recently.
[45:38.360 --> 45:38.500]  Yeah.
[45:38.580 --> 45:42.660]  You do any good scouting of like what the current British snack scene is?
[45:42.800 --> 45:43.660]  Oh, my God.
[45:43.680 --> 45:44.820]  That's how it's spelled.
[45:45.080 --> 45:45.980]  Yeah, it is how it's spelled.
[45:46.940 --> 45:48.620]  Sarsaparilla is how you spell sarsaparilla.
[45:48.640 --> 45:51.240]  I had no idea that's how you spell sarsaparilla.
[45:51.420 --> 45:51.940]  I'm a fucking idiot.
[45:51.940 --> 45:53.120]  Oh, that doesn't look right at all.
[45:53.280 --> 45:54.560]  Holy shit.
[45:54.560 --> 45:56.320]  Why is it pronounced sarsaparilla?
[45:56.460 --> 45:57.420]  I don't know.
[45:57.600 --> 45:58.880]  That's blown my mind.
[45:59.300 --> 46:01.040]  Yeah, that just looks weird.
[46:01.180 --> 46:02.580]  It looks so wrong written, sarsaparilla.
[46:02.840 --> 46:06.400]  Nick, you're the only one of us that isn't a dumbass right now.
[46:06.480 --> 46:07.940]  Eric is a dumbass by omission.
[46:08.420 --> 46:09.960]  If he was right, he would have chimed in.
[46:10.400 --> 46:11.380]  So we know he didn't know.
[46:11.960 --> 46:16.480]  But Gavin and Andrew and I are fucking stupid.
[46:16.800 --> 46:18.760]  Well, I've only heard it said.
[46:18.880 --> 46:19.860]  I don't think I've ever seen it written.
[46:19.880 --> 46:20.900]  Yeah, I've never seen it written.
[46:21.240 --> 46:21.520]  Same, but no.
[46:21.520 --> 46:22.740]  So, Nick, you already knew that?
[46:22.900 --> 46:23.980]  Yeah, from the Simpsons.
[46:25.420 --> 46:28.020]  Oh, I've also seen the Simpsons, but I didn't know it.
[46:28.060 --> 46:30.620]  That was the episode where Grandpa Simpson has his kidneys explode.
[46:30.800 --> 46:32.260]  He keeps drinking the sarsaparillas at the bar.
[46:32.540 --> 46:33.460]  Is that what happens?
[46:33.640 --> 46:35.580]  And it's spelled correctly on the bar.
[46:35.620 --> 46:37.800]  Yeah, his kidneys explode because he held his pee afterwards.
[46:39.400 --> 46:39.760]  Sarsaparilla.
[46:39.760 --> 46:41.280]  I'm not going to call it sarsaparilla anymore.
[46:41.400 --> 46:43.040]  I'm going to call it what it is, sarsaparilla.
[46:45.240 --> 46:47.620]  I'm going to order a Sioux City sarsaparilla.
[46:47.840 --> 46:48.680]  I never thought about it.
[46:48.720 --> 46:51.840]  I've seen it spelled so many times because of Fallout New Vegas,
[46:51.840 --> 46:53.180]  and that is how it's spelled everywhere.
[46:53.180 --> 46:57.420]  It's just the word is so long with so many S's.
[46:57.540 --> 46:59.200]  It's just a series of squiggles to me.
[46:59.560 --> 47:00.700]  You like, sight-read it, you know?
[47:00.800 --> 47:01.600]  Looked at it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:01.700 --> 47:03.880]  Like, you see it, nothing else looks...
[47:03.880 --> 47:09.480]  Like, marsupial is the only word that looks similar to sarsaparilla.
[47:10.020 --> 47:13.660]  Yeah, if it doesn't start with an M, then I know it's sarsaparilla.
[47:13.860 --> 47:15.520]  If it starts with an M, I know it's marsupial.
[47:17.900 --> 47:18.260]  Marsupial.
[47:18.440 --> 47:20.980]  We should invent a drink called sarsaparilla,
[47:20.980 --> 47:23.620]  and it's spelled the way we think sarsaparilla is,
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.980]  and then put that out, and then we can sue
[47:26.980 --> 47:30.440]  all the makers of sarsaparilla for stealing our fucking product.
[47:30.700 --> 47:33.080]  Andrew, is that how you think you spell marsupial?
[47:33.520 --> 47:35.740]  I just, I took a swing at it.
[47:35.880 --> 47:38.280]  I've never done it. I've never thought about it.
[47:38.500 --> 47:40.980]  You think it has the word soup in the middle?
[47:41.980 --> 47:43.640]  It's very, it sounds like it.
[47:43.960 --> 47:45.820]  Mar, okay, let me try to figure this out.
[47:45.860 --> 47:49.320]  So my initial attempt was M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[47:49.320 --> 47:51.760]  Uh, what about this?
[47:51.900 --> 47:54.680]  Oh, you know what? What if I get a little fancy with it?
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.020]  Oh, that's...
[47:56.020 --> 47:56.920]  Marsupial.
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.440]  M-A-R-S-U-P-I-A-L.
[48:01.340 --> 48:01.760]  Marsupial?
[48:05.120 --> 48:06.180]  What about this?
[48:08.060 --> 48:10.480]  M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[48:12.380 --> 48:14.480]  You got real close once.
[48:14.980 --> 48:15.340]  Okay.
[48:16.020 --> 48:19.300]  Uh, M-A-R-E-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[48:20.200 --> 48:20.680]  What?
[48:21.900 --> 48:23.600]  M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[48:23.740 --> 48:25.300]  M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L.
[48:26.440 --> 48:26.920]  What?
[48:27.540 --> 48:28.480]  M-A-R-S-O-U-P-I-A-L?
[48:28.880 --> 48:32.780]  Let me, I'm gonna start going letter by letter, and you tell me when I'm wrong,
[48:32.880 --> 48:34.280]  and then I'll work until I get it right.
[48:34.540 --> 48:35.580]  Okay, M.
[48:36.120 --> 48:36.900]  Yeah, you got that.
[48:37.240 --> 48:37.540]  A.
[48:37.780 --> 48:38.120]  Yep.
[48:38.540 --> 48:38.900]  R.
[48:39.400 --> 48:39.700]  Yep.
[48:40.280 --> 48:40.700]  R?
[48:41.100 --> 48:42.000]  No, what?
[48:42.140 --> 48:42.440]  S.
[48:42.740 --> 48:43.220]  Yes.
[48:43.460 --> 48:43.520]  Yes.
[48:44.280 --> 48:44.760]  O.
[48:44.980 --> 48:45.280]  No.
[48:45.420 --> 48:45.660]  No.
[48:46.340 --> 48:46.720]  U.
[48:47.040 --> 48:47.280]  Yes.
[48:47.280 --> 48:47.620]  Yes.
[48:48.060 --> 48:48.540]  P.
[48:49.420 --> 48:51.240]  Isn't it exactly how it sounds?
[48:51.640 --> 48:51.840]  Yes.
[48:52.720 --> 48:53.180]  A.
[48:53.620 --> 48:54.020]  Yes.
[48:54.700 --> 48:56.280]  I can't believe I never put that in.
[48:56.620 --> 48:57.360]  That's insane.
[48:58.020 --> 48:58.200]  L.
[48:58.500 --> 49:00.120]  I made like 15 guesses.
[49:00.520 --> 49:02.800]  You got real close, you just had two Ps on one of them.
[49:03.200 --> 49:04.620]  I've just looked it up, and uh,
[49:05.100 --> 49:09.580]  Sarsaparilla, spelt how I thought it was spelled, dot com, is available for $12,000.
[49:10.000 --> 49:11.080]  Oh my god.
[49:11.700 --> 49:14.480]  We're gonna have to sell a lot of sarsaparilla to afford that.
[49:17.980 --> 49:20.360]  Fucking, is sarsaparilla available?
[49:20.620 --> 49:22.720]  Yeah, yeah, look up sarsaparilla dot com.
[49:22.900 --> 49:24.420]  No one will ever go to it, but check it out.
[49:26.320 --> 49:27.980]  Sarsaparilla dot com.
[49:28.660 --> 49:29.180]  Sarsaparilla.
[49:29.420 --> 49:30.880]  Unavailable, unfortunately.
[49:31.200 --> 49:31.720]  Bummer.
[49:32.600 --> 49:35.320]  What about any of the ways Andrew spelled marsupial?
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.240]  Mars, with soup in the middle is so crazy.
[49:42.780 --> 49:44.220]  Sorry, 404 error.
[49:44.480 --> 49:48.600]  I need to email webmaster at marsupial dot com.
[49:48.800 --> 49:51.160]  Would any of the marsupials be soupable?
[49:51.500 --> 49:53.460]  What's the most soupable marsupial?
[49:53.700 --> 49:54.700]  Oh, that's a great question.
[49:55.300 --> 49:57.000]  I gave you a list, there it is.
[49:57.480 --> 49:58.860]  Possum soup exists.
[49:59.340 --> 50:00.860]  Kangaroo soup is probably real.
[50:01.440 --> 50:05.620]  Yeah, potaroos, that seems like potatoes, and I think you could probably do that.
[50:05.880 --> 50:09.400]  Oh, pota, pota, potaroo.
[50:09.460 --> 50:12.320]  Potaroo, that seems like potato, it's pretty close.
[50:12.660 --> 50:14.080]  I would eat a bandicoot.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.220]  Oh, dude, did you know that I only found out?
[50:16.720 --> 50:17.980]  Okay, that sucks.
[50:18.040 --> 50:19.320]  Andrew, it's in front of you.
[50:20.600 --> 50:22.480]  Yeah, I can't see it, it's too small.
[50:22.580 --> 50:23.180]  I'd have to click it.
[50:23.360 --> 50:26.720]  I only found out a bandicoot was a real animal like last year.
[50:26.920 --> 50:27.180]  Really?
[50:27.580 --> 50:28.540]  Yeah, I thought it was made up.
[50:28.620 --> 50:29.900]  I thought they made up a bandicoot.
[50:31.300 --> 50:33.900]  I learned wolverines are real from Far Cry.
[50:34.900 --> 50:36.180]  And I was disappointed.
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.140]  You just think it was an X-Man?
[50:38.500 --> 50:40.260]  Yeah, I just thought it was an X-Man name.
[50:40.260 --> 50:44.160]  You thought the Michigan Wolverines named themselves after a movie?
[50:44.160 --> 50:47.840]  I don't have Michigan Wolverines in my life, it's a US college.
[50:47.940 --> 50:49.920]  What about Tasmanian devils?
[50:50.260 --> 50:52.280]  Yeah, they'd strike me as real.
[50:52.560 --> 50:53.460]  That's a cryptid.
[50:55.220 --> 50:58.680]  Did you say that you couldn't read the spelling because it's too small?
[50:58.940 --> 50:59.140]  Yeah.
[50:59.420 --> 51:00.520]  You know, you can click on this.
[51:00.780 --> 51:04.960]  Yeah, I said I'd have to click on it. I specified that.
[51:05.140 --> 51:06.980]  Oh, we will, you know, don't go anywhere.
[51:07.760 --> 51:09.020]  What's a numbat?
[51:09.020 --> 51:10.860]  Numbat might be my new favorite creature.
[51:10.960 --> 51:13.080]  These things are, oh my god, these things are cool.
[51:13.160 --> 51:13.460]  That's a Pokemon, I believe?
[51:13.800 --> 51:14.180]  A numbat?
[51:14.780 --> 51:16.380]  Look at this thing. Look at his tongue.
[51:16.660 --> 51:17.540]  Oh shit, look at his tongue!
[51:17.580 --> 51:18.340]  Oh, wow.
[51:18.860 --> 51:20.700]  Dude, numbat might be the new hotness.
[51:20.940 --> 51:21.940]  You know that dude's popular.
[51:22.220 --> 51:23.800]  That's a lot of non-bat bats.
[51:24.140 --> 51:24.480]  Yeah.
[51:25.240 --> 51:27.100]  Should we have a bats not bats draft?
[51:27.440 --> 51:28.120]  Might be worth doing.
[51:28.280 --> 51:29.620]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.240]  Bats not bats draft.
[51:31.380 --> 51:33.220]  All right, I'm putting it on the list here. I'll put it in there.
[51:33.300 --> 51:33.940]  Numbat wombat.
[51:33.960 --> 51:36.160]  Is Bruce Wayne a bat that's not a bat?
[51:36.300 --> 51:37.760]  Or is Batman a bat that's not a bat?
[51:37.760 --> 51:38.300]  I think so.
[51:38.300 --> 51:39.340]  He's not an actual bat.
[51:39.460 --> 51:39.660]  Yeah.
[51:39.800 --> 51:40.900]  Is Man Bat one?
[51:41.100 --> 51:41.940]  Well, I mean, he's a bat.
[51:41.940 --> 51:42.500]  I think he's part bat.
[51:42.500 --> 51:43.680]  I think he's part bat.
[51:43.920 --> 51:44.120]  Yeah.
[51:44.480 --> 51:47.700]  Is Bruce Wayne more bat than Batman is?
[51:48.180 --> 51:50.460]  I want you to explain what you mean.
[51:50.780 --> 51:54.800]  Okay, so Bruce Wayne is just a guy, right?
[51:54.860 --> 51:56.300]  But he's super into bats.
[51:56.920 --> 52:01.240]  I would say that Bruce Wayne comes across as more of a bat enthusiast than Batman.
[52:01.480 --> 52:02.060]  I thought you were scared of bats.
[52:02.060 --> 52:06.720]  You think the guy who goes about his life in a business suit from day to day
[52:07.920 --> 52:12.920]  expresses more bat-like aura than a guy who flies around dressed up as a bat all night
[52:12.920 --> 52:14.280]  and says he's a bat man?
[52:14.620 --> 52:16.540]  And hangs upside down and jumps on people.
[52:16.760 --> 52:18.160]  Well, when you put it like that, no.
[52:18.600 --> 52:19.860]  No, he's phrasing it that way.
[52:20.140 --> 52:24.120]  When you explain it or we think about it for two seconds, no, I guess I'm wrong.
[52:24.140 --> 52:24.660]  No, no, no.
[52:24.660 --> 52:28.080]  It's just my thought was that, like, Batman to me is not...
[52:28.080 --> 52:29.860]  When I see Batman, I don't think bat.
[52:30.200 --> 52:31.500]  I think of, like, Cape Crusader.
[52:31.940 --> 52:34.260]  That's the fucking first thing I think, I think, honestly.
[52:34.260 --> 52:35.280]  I don't think of bats.
[52:35.280 --> 52:36.760]  But Bruce Wayne...
[52:36.760 --> 52:38.760]  There's a bat on it, like, on his chest.
[52:39.040 --> 52:40.060]  Totally. Absolutely.
[52:40.220 --> 52:41.620]  Like the symbolism, but he doesn't...
[52:41.620 --> 52:42.220]  It is!
[52:42.400 --> 52:43.180]  I can't explain...
[52:43.180 --> 52:46.900]  Like, there's no way for me to explain this in a way that would make sense to anybody else.
[52:47.120 --> 52:53.040]  But Batman himself as a person doesn't necessarily strike me as a dude who's into bats
[52:53.040 --> 52:55.560]  as much as he is just a bat man.
[52:55.900 --> 53:00.480]  Where Bruce Wayne strikes me as a man that is into bats,
[53:00.520 --> 53:03.600]  but has nothing to do with them, but is very into them.
[53:04.380 --> 53:04.820]  So...
[53:05.440 --> 53:08.700]  So he's more of a bat enthusiast than when he's a bat?
[53:09.020 --> 53:09.940]  He's less of an...
[53:09.940 --> 53:11.800]  When he's a bat, he's just a bat.
[53:11.940 --> 53:13.220]  He just happens to be a bat.
[53:13.700 --> 53:18.820]  But when he's a man, just a normal man, he is an enthusiast of bats.
[53:19.400 --> 53:22.200]  Is this the worst thing you've ever said?
[53:22.700 --> 53:23.480]  I don't think so.
[53:23.980 --> 53:25.700]  I'm at a four, I think?
[53:26.260 --> 53:27.440]  Yeah, I wanna slide...
[53:29.060 --> 53:32.140]  There's gonna be one person that gets what I'm saying and they're with me.
[53:32.320 --> 53:32.840]  And that's okay.
[53:32.840 --> 53:38.700]  But the other version of him, he has a bat wing cape and flies around.
[53:38.920 --> 53:41.380]  He lives in a bat cave.
[53:41.640 --> 53:42.820]  He drives a bat car.
[53:44.280 --> 53:45.080]  But he...
[53:45.080 --> 53:47.060]  Okay, but Bruce Wayne put all that together.
[53:47.200 --> 53:48.960]  He throws a batarang.
[53:49.940 --> 53:51.420]  Bruce Wayne did all that.
[53:51.540 --> 53:52.320]  Like, I don't...
[53:52.320 --> 53:56.880]  I think Batman is a product of Bruce Wayne, who's really into bats.
[53:57.120 --> 54:01.700]  So because Bruce Wayne decided and created a costume where he was a bat,
[54:01.700 --> 54:03.800]  he is more Batman than when he's wearing it.
[54:04.380 --> 54:04.660]  Yes.
[54:05.040 --> 54:06.080]  That's what you mean?
[54:06.460 --> 54:07.260]  Like, yes.
[54:10.740 --> 54:15.120]  I would say that he's more than a bat man.
[54:15.360 --> 54:22.440]  But when he wears the costume, he is the distilled vision of what his bat enthusiasm is.
[54:22.480 --> 54:24.400]  He is the most of that thing he could be.
[54:24.400 --> 54:31.520]  So when Tony Stark makes Peter Parker the nanotech spider suit with the
[54:31.520 --> 54:36.100]  four other legs that come out of the back, does that mean Tony Stark is Spider-Man?
[54:36.700 --> 54:38.440]  Can I rephrase this in a different way?
[54:39.680 --> 54:41.000]  Okay, so you have...
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.020]  Let's say Crocodile Dundee.
[54:43.400 --> 54:45.280]  That guy's really into crocodiles.
[54:45.280 --> 54:46.200]  I got this.
[54:46.480 --> 54:46.900]  I like this.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.460]  But he's a man.
[54:47.900 --> 54:50.120]  But he's a man and he's super into crocodiles.
[54:50.320 --> 54:51.540]  He's clearly into crocodiles.
[54:51.540 --> 54:57.800]  If Crocodile Dundee was a crocodile, that doesn't necessarily mean he's into crocodiles.
[54:58.020 --> 54:58.800]  He's just a crocodile.
[54:59.200 --> 55:00.240]  But he is a man.
[55:00.560 --> 55:02.040]  But he's more of a crocodile.
[55:02.480 --> 55:02.640]  What?
[55:02.820 --> 55:05.700]  If he was a crocodile, he'd be more of a crocodile than a human man.
[55:06.880 --> 55:07.840]  Yeah, but I'm saying...
[55:08.260 --> 55:11.480]  Do you think Batman likes bats less than Bruce Wayne likes bats?
[55:11.580 --> 55:12.160]  Is that what you're saying?
[55:12.160 --> 55:13.520]  Okay, I'm a person.
[55:13.820 --> 55:15.860]  That doesn't mean I'm a person enthusiast.
[55:17.780 --> 55:18.180]  So...
[55:18.180 --> 55:20.480]  But if a dog was really into person culture,
[55:21.140 --> 55:24.600]  they would be more of an enthusiast about being a person than I am.
[55:24.720 --> 55:27.680]  So there's a man and a raccoon in the street.
[55:27.900 --> 55:28.880]  There's a bus coming for them.
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.180]  You can dive and save one of them.
[55:30.220 --> 55:31.780]  You would not save the person?
[55:32.060 --> 55:33.940]  No, I'd save the person, absolutely.
[55:34.300 --> 55:36.420]  Even if you're not a huge people person?
[55:36.640 --> 55:40.200]  Yeah, well, because I value a human life more than a raccoon life.
[55:40.440 --> 55:41.800]  That's pretty people of you.
[55:41.800 --> 55:49.220]  Unless the human made the whatever, the slug bomb, the food bank, whatever weapon you made.
[55:49.520 --> 55:50.220]  I'd let them get hit.
[55:50.460 --> 55:54.560]  What if the raccoon was a guardian of the galaxy, though, and trying on an important mission?
[55:55.080 --> 55:56.180]  Well, now that's...
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.300]  Damn, you threw a real wrench in this plan.
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.600]  How much time do I have to determine if this raccoon is a guardian of the galaxy or not?
[56:03.620 --> 56:06.000]  I mean, it has to have a laser blaster on it, probably.
[56:06.480 --> 56:08.260]  Or like bandoleros, you know what I mean?
[56:08.260 --> 56:11.720]  I think I would be able to identify that quick enough that I would be able to make the right
[56:11.720 --> 56:11.980]  choice.
[56:12.100 --> 56:12.720]  Fair enough.
[56:12.900 --> 56:15.860]  Although I think Rocket Raccoon could survive getting hit by a bus.
[56:16.140 --> 56:16.360]  Could he?
[56:16.500 --> 56:17.320]  Love to find out.
[56:17.360 --> 56:18.700]  Someone understands what I'm saying.
[56:19.960 --> 56:22.800]  Well, I think I do, but I don't know why you're saying it.
[56:23.180 --> 56:26.280]  Yeah, I don't remember either because we've gotten so far off track.
[56:26.840 --> 56:28.440]  I don't remember what started the conversation.
[56:28.840 --> 56:29.280]  Numbats.
[56:29.940 --> 56:30.380]  Numbats.
[56:31.020 --> 56:31.460]  Varsupial.
[56:31.720 --> 56:34.520]  Yeah, we were going to have a bats not bats draft, I think.
[56:34.680 --> 56:35.540]  Oh, that's yeah.
[56:35.980 --> 56:36.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:36.940 --> 56:37.200]  Okay.
[56:37.400 --> 56:39.320]  So you would draft Bruce Wayne.
[56:39.320 --> 56:43.120]  I would draft Bruce Wayne over Batman because I think Bruce Wayne is more.
[56:43.320 --> 56:43.600]  You can have him.
[56:43.700 --> 56:45.360]  I mean, it's I'm drafting Batman, so it's fine.
[56:45.500 --> 56:46.560]  Yeah, so he'll win.
[56:46.700 --> 56:50.920]  But I'm drafting Danny DeVito as Man Bat, who is still a man.
[56:51.020 --> 56:51.780]  Is there like?
[56:52.140 --> 56:52.960]  Man Spider, not Spider.
[56:52.980 --> 56:53.240]  Yeah.
[56:53.500 --> 56:55.220]  Yeah, I mean, you messed it all up.
[56:55.300 --> 56:55.820]  You're all freaked out.
[56:56.020 --> 56:57.100]  Blew it all up in my head.
[56:57.300 --> 56:59.020]  I'd go Bruce Wayne, then Shohei Otani.
[56:59.340 --> 56:59.660]  Okay.
[57:00.980 --> 57:02.660]  I got my pick.
[57:02.740 --> 57:03.560]  I mean, I'm good.
[57:03.620 --> 57:05.900]  I already know who I'm drafting for my bat not bat draft.
[57:06.200 --> 57:06.660]  All four?
[57:07.400 --> 57:09.220]  No, I got I have most of them.
[57:09.320 --> 57:12.440]  I think, yeah, I could probably I could probably do it pretty easy.
[57:12.540 --> 57:14.100]  Is a vampire a bat not bat?
[57:14.320 --> 57:15.200]  A vampire is a bat.
[57:15.480 --> 57:15.720]  Really?
[57:17.260 --> 57:17.660]  What?
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.500]  I don't I don't know about that.
[57:20.720 --> 57:20.900]  About?
[57:21.260 --> 57:22.940]  In all cases is what I'm saying.
[57:23.080 --> 57:24.220]  A vampire being a bat.
[57:24.460 --> 57:26.000]  Well, I mean, in in reality, though.
[57:26.040 --> 57:29.960]  The Twilight kids are not that there are no bats involved in Twilight.
[57:30.320 --> 57:30.780]  It's baseball.
[57:31.080 --> 57:31.940]  Yeah, you know what?
[57:31.940 --> 57:33.060]  Actually, I take back my point.
[57:33.120 --> 57:33.440]  You're right.
[57:33.620 --> 57:34.360]  That's a good point.
[57:35.160 --> 57:36.380]  And baseball uses bats.
[57:36.760 --> 57:38.420]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[57:38.920 --> 57:39.540]  You're right.
[57:39.640 --> 57:40.440]  I was wrong about that.
[57:42.080 --> 57:44.660]  That was you deactivated the Twilight bat.
[57:44.900 --> 57:46.040]  Oh, man, that was impressive.
[57:46.580 --> 57:48.800]  That was no action movie deactivation.
[57:48.900 --> 57:51.920]  There was six minutes on the clock and you defuse that bomb.
[57:53.200 --> 57:54.100]  That was great.
[57:54.260 --> 57:55.420]  Just like Bruce Wayne would do.
[57:55.680 --> 57:57.460]  Just like Bruce Wayne would do.
[57:57.840 --> 58:01.340]  Do you think if it came down to it, you'd be a bomb defuser or a bomb?
[58:01.500 --> 58:02.720]  Get rid of a bomb.
[58:02.840 --> 58:03.340]  Get rid of her.
[58:03.420 --> 58:03.980]  Yeah, absolutely.
[58:04.280 --> 58:05.780]  Sling it to safety.
[58:06.100 --> 58:07.420]  Yeah, I don't.
[58:07.420 --> 58:10.340]  Well, no, yeah, I'd get rid of it.
[58:10.400 --> 58:13.360]  I guess I would wonder if you cut a wire, would it instantly blow up?
[58:13.520 --> 58:16.540]  Because in movies, they always present that like that could happen.
[58:16.840 --> 58:17.500]  Certainly could happen.
[58:17.880 --> 58:19.480]  What if you cut all wires at once?
[58:19.980 --> 58:20.880]  Has anyone ever done that?
[58:21.580 --> 58:22.300]  Same time?
[58:23.800 --> 58:26.300]  Well, if there's a battery that doesn't have wires.
[58:26.460 --> 58:31.380]  They always say that if you don't do it the right sequence, it'll trigger an immediate explosion.
[58:32.140 --> 58:37.900]  If people read the description of the episodes that I write before they listen to the episode,
[58:38.120 --> 58:43.460]  like the last things listed are the most soupable marsupial bat, not bat draft,
[58:43.800 --> 58:46.180]  a person enthusiast and bomb defusal.
[58:46.640 --> 58:48.560]  That is what we've been talking about.
[58:48.980 --> 58:51.500]  That is where we're at as a show.
[58:51.960 --> 58:53.300]  What are we going to talk about next time?
[58:53.460 --> 58:53.920]  I don't know.
[58:53.980 --> 58:55.380]  I'm excited to find out in 2025.
[58:55.820 --> 58:56.720]  This is exciting.
[58:56.960 --> 58:58.380]  Next episode will be the new year.
[58:58.500 --> 58:58.980]  Oh, sweet.
[58:58.980 --> 59:02.280]  If you Google image search bats that aren't bats,
[59:02.360 --> 59:05.540]  all you get is bats that are definitely bats.
[59:05.840 --> 59:06.120]  Interesting.
[59:07.040 --> 59:07.260]  Here.
[59:07.460 --> 59:08.100]  Yes, you do.
[59:08.220 --> 59:09.280]  It's just bats.
[59:09.560 --> 59:10.320]  It's just bats.
[59:10.420 --> 59:11.740]  It's just nothing but bats.
[59:11.920 --> 59:12.540]  Nothing but bats.
[59:13.080 --> 59:13.560]  It's Bat City.
[59:13.940 --> 59:15.220]  Well, what would you expect it to return?
[59:15.360 --> 59:16.720]  Everything else that isn't a bat?
[59:17.040 --> 59:18.100]  A baseball bat, maybe?
[59:18.780 --> 59:20.620]  Bats that aren't animals.
[59:22.300 --> 59:23.580]  Nope, it's just still bats.
[59:25.740 --> 59:26.880]  Not a bat.
[59:26.880 --> 59:31.280]  What would you have to put into Google with bat as a part of your search for it to return?
[59:31.480 --> 59:32.540]  No pictures of bats.
[59:32.720 --> 59:33.480]  I'm Googling.
[59:33.680 --> 59:35.140]  Show me things that aren't bats.
[59:35.480 --> 59:36.300]  Google image search.
[59:36.380 --> 59:37.140]  First things a bat.
[59:37.340 --> 59:38.020]  Yeah, it's all bats.
[59:38.180 --> 59:41.080]  If you search, don't show me a single picture of a bat.
[59:41.260 --> 59:41.540]  Would it show?
[59:41.740 --> 59:41.920]  Okay, here.
[59:42.240 --> 59:42.320]  Here.
[59:42.700 --> 59:43.260]  Hang on.
[59:43.960 --> 59:45.120]  Here we go.
[59:45.320 --> 59:49.300]  Don't show me a single picture of a bat.
[59:49.640 --> 59:49.920]  Okay?
[59:50.760 --> 59:50.980]  Nope.
[59:54.540 --> 59:56.120]  It's just nothing but bats, guys.
[59:56.880 --> 59:58.620]  Can you search vampire for me, please?
[59:58.860 --> 59:59.680]  Search vampire?
[59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.920]  Yeah, look at vampire.
[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.940]  Not a single bat.
[01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.940]  Not a single... well, there's some wings.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.020]  There's a bat right here.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:06.440]  Where?
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.680]  There is a bat above.
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.880]  I didn't even have to scroll down.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:09.860]  There's bats right here.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.160]  Well, those are wings, but there's a bat right there.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:12.520]  What are you talking about?
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.660]  There's bats in the picture.
[01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.600]  Oh, I didn't even see them.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.460]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:17.200]  I didn't see it.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.540]  There's bats in the picture.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.740]  There's a bat in this one.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.260]  Clearly bat focused.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.680]  That's bats right there on the left.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.620]  It's much smaller what we can see than what you can see.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.060]  No, I understand.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.140]  I understand.
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:28.660]  It's just...
[01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.360]  The bat ratio is a lot lower though with vampire.
[01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:36.340]  I just don't know what else you would search to not see bats.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.820]  Nick wants you to try Bing.
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:38.780]  Try Bing.
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.380]  Bing, not bats.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.680]  Bing, not bats.
[01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:45.680]  Okay, you want me to search not bats?
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.720]  Not bats.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.340]  Okay.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:49.600]  Okay.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:50.380]  Okay.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:50.820]  Yeah!
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.960]  But there's bats.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.080]  It's very different.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.300]  It's just a not...
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.280]  Like it's a sign that says no bats essentially.
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.900]  Yeah, why would the sign ever say no bats?
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.640]  Wouldn't the sign say like warning bats?
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:07.260]  There's seven vampires that aren't bats.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.700]  These are all bats.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:10.680]  Yeah.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:12.580]  This one's mad.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.440]  Are mosquitoes vampires?
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:15.400]  Probably.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.960]  I blame this on...
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.060]  I blame this on AI.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.100]  It's all ChadGPT's fault.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:20.360]  I'm with Geoff.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.140]  I'm with Geoff.
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.580]  Yeah, I can suck it.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.020]  Are mosquitoes vampires?
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.440]  Are bats mosquitoes?
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.780]  No, mosquitoes are not vampires.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.180]  Bummer.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:29.720]  Why?
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.500]  While mosquitoes do suck blood, they are not obligated...
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:38.140]  Wait, they are not obligate blood suckers.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.680]  I guess it's just for their babies.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.240]  Meaning they can get nutrients from other sources.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.040]  Like what?
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.360]  They drink nectar?
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:45.660]  Oh, weird.
[01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.120]  Yeah, they just drink nectar, I think.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:51.860]  But then if the female is making eggs, it needs mammal blood or something.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:52.520]  Crazy.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:55.220]  So I've been staking them in the heart for no reason?
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.300]  Shit.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.740]  Geoff, wrap us up.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.360]  Get us out of here.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.100]  We have to go.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.860]  Does a vampire have to live on blood to be a vampire?
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.620]  Yeah, exclusively, right?
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.980]  Is a vampire blood obligate?
[01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:11.340]  Don't we all live on blood at a technical level?
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.540]  Research indicates...
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.780]  Oh, this is about vampire bats.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.820]  Yes, vampire bats are obligate blood-eating mammals.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.800]  So I would assume that vampires, normal style, are.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.000]  Okay, there you go.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.100]  Well, there you go.
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:26.940]  It sounds like it's time for me to wrap this up.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.800]  I'd like to leave y'all with a thought, something to take into your lives after...
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.220]  to leave the podcast with to think about for the rest of the week.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.700]  Maybe it'll help you through something in your life.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.840]  I was thinking, I was listening to Howard Stern the other day.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.960]  He was talking about how he used to jack off to girdle ads all the time in the newspaper.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.420]  And it reminded me that when we were kids, we would always jack off to Sears catalogs, right?
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.040]  And then now the porn is so much more plentiful with the internet.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.880]  And it's like technology has really improved that.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.420]  But I was taking it back the other way.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.220]  I thought like, man, it's so much easier to jerk off to stuff than it used to be.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.920]  Howard had to do it in girdle ads.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.020]  What was worse than that?
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.680]  And I realized, I was thinking about when I was walking around your castles in England,
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.540]  Gavin, and they had tapestries everywhere.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.000]  And those were like the TVs of the day.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.160]  So do you think back in the day when people hung out in castles,
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.440]  do you think they ever jerked off to their tapestries?
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.080]  You know, there's like a guy in town who has the dirtiest taps.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.240]  You just like, you roll out, like you feel your wife goes out of town for the weekend
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.500]  to visit her sister and you roll out a tapestry and hang it up on the wall in your bedroom.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.340]  And you just beat it furiously.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.680]  They're all double-sided and he just spins around.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.100]  Do you have tapestries that are like, they get crusty and hard, you know,
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.560]  you get like a little close up to them?
[01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.300]  Anyway, if you had to, if you had to for a week or say a month,
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.140]  you could only monk off to pre-1800s porn. Could you do it?
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.400]  I don't like monk off. I think that was the subtitle of one of the Alvin and the Chipmunks
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.000]  reboots. I believe it was the second one was monk off.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.440]  I'm imagining taking it further back at cave paintings.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:09.900]  Take that into your personal life and see how you can apply it to your day to day.
[01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:14.400]  And we'll see you right back here next week for another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.560]  Coming at you in 2025.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.380]  Is a tick a vampire?
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:36.260]  Ticks, real live vampires, according to Science for Georgia.
