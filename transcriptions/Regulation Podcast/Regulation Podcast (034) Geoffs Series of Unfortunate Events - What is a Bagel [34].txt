[00:00.000 --> 00:03.260]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.800 --> 00:07.760]  This is episode 34. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, the other idiots,
[00:08.080 --> 00:12.380]  also known as Andrew, Gavin, Nick and Lil Eric.
[00:12.840 --> 00:13.100]  Hello.
[00:13.360 --> 00:13.800]  Hello.
[00:14.440 --> 00:20.440]  What channel was 34 for you on TV in the past? Do you remember what 34 was?
[00:20.520 --> 00:21.360]  Did you have a channel 34?
[00:21.580 --> 00:27.260]  Man, you know, that's so weird because for me, I feel like TV went from 12 channels to a thousand.
[00:27.260 --> 00:30.380]  And I don't know that I ever had a 34.
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.920]  Channel 34 for me growing up was Comedy Central.
[00:34.500 --> 00:36.500]  Let's watch some Cheers during the day.
[00:36.620 --> 00:42.680]  That's a good one. Comedy Central was 48. I think TBS or TNT was 34. They switched at one point.
[00:42.980 --> 00:44.680]  Ooh, 33 was TBS.
[00:45.240 --> 00:47.860]  Were you like a type the channel number in kind of guy?
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.800]  No, I just scroll. That was my first version of scrolling,
[00:51.860 --> 00:55.580]  was just sitting with the remote going up nonstop until I found something.
[00:55.580 --> 00:58.880]  You didn't just look at the guide where you could see like 10 things at once?
[00:59.160 --> 01:01.260]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, listen, this was pre-guide, man.
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.720]  This was you got to go to channel three and see the channel where
[01:04.720 --> 01:07.020]  it told you what was playing on all the channels.
[01:08.060 --> 01:12.400]  Yeah, this was like, I remember pre-guide where you would just you'd have to go to 99
[01:12.400 --> 01:15.580]  and that would be all of the channel scrolling.
[01:15.900 --> 01:18.800]  And then you would start it too. There was nothing on one.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.660]  You would start at two and then scroll, just go up USA, ESPN, local.
[01:24.660 --> 01:26.640]  And then like you just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:26.780 --> 01:28.060]  And then you go through all of them.
[01:28.260 --> 01:33.920]  I just don't think I had satellite before. I think when I had pre-guide TV, I just had
[01:33.920 --> 01:34.700]  five channels.
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.320]  Ah, oh, you missed out because there are times, you know, when it was when it was bad.
[01:39.560 --> 01:42.600]  You just watch the channel scroll channel. There's nothing else on.
[01:43.160 --> 01:46.620]  Or you just turn on the weather channel and jam out to that.
[01:46.860 --> 01:50.680]  Listen, I got the weather channel on all the time in December.
[01:50.840 --> 01:53.180]  I'm a big weather channel guy in December. Love it.
[01:53.260 --> 01:53.960]  Great music.
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.000]  Great music.
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.720]  I think I think that as people, we really lost out when channel surfing went away.
[02:01.080 --> 02:07.840]  There's there's like analysis paralysis now because you could be watching an Oscar worthy
[02:07.840 --> 02:11.380]  movie, but you want to just put something on.
[02:11.460 --> 02:14.020]  And so you don't choose like the really, really good thing.
[02:14.120 --> 02:16.240]  And I think it just I think it's preventative.
[02:16.360 --> 02:17.820]  It's sad that we can't scroll.
[02:18.280 --> 02:20.480]  Yeah, but everyone just scrolls in their phone and it's way worse.
[02:23.180 --> 02:25.760]  You know what? Hey, when you're right, you're right, man.
[02:26.860 --> 02:30.140]  I remember when I first got Sky, like satellite TV,
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.280]  if if someone in my family was watching the old school terrestrial channels,
[02:36.020 --> 02:39.840]  I could mash buttons on the Sky remote and it would make the picture go like
[02:40.520 --> 02:43.040]  and make it like do little farts of noise.
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.420]  And it was really starting to piss people off.
[02:47.160 --> 02:48.960]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[02:48.960 --> 02:51.900]  Whenever we're done with TV, I have a I have a series of
[02:51.900 --> 02:53.960]  misfortunate events I wanted to share with you guys.
[02:54.100 --> 02:55.380]  Oh, no.
[02:58.040 --> 02:59.160]  I don't know.
[02:59.380 --> 03:03.440]  Geoff, I was thinking about this relating to your misfortunate events.
[03:03.600 --> 03:05.620]  I don't get the same joy from them anymore.
[03:05.700 --> 03:06.500]  It's really sad.
[03:07.040 --> 03:08.300]  It's really unfortunate.
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.080]  Now that we're a small company, the you having to endure
[03:13.080 --> 03:16.020]  through things is infinitely less enjoyable.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.340]  Oh, my God, dude.
[03:17.380 --> 03:18.440]  I'm in a situation right now.
[03:18.440 --> 03:21.820]  I'm not even talking about it where, you know, I'm still experiencing the jaw thing.
[03:21.940 --> 03:23.460]  Yeah, still working through that.
[03:23.560 --> 03:28.560]  Seeing doctors and scientists and fucking NASA and stuff to try to figure out what's going on.
[03:28.580 --> 03:35.360]  But there's some concern that one of the New Jersey drones might be in my jaw.
[03:36.300 --> 03:38.360]  Might have appeared out of the ocean.
[03:38.460 --> 03:38.980]  You're the mother ship.
[03:39.360 --> 03:40.240]  Yeah, I might be.
[03:40.320 --> 03:41.420]  They might be coming from me.
[03:42.020 --> 03:46.000]  But also my wife every year, you know, she has to work like crazy around the holidays
[03:46.000 --> 03:47.920]  because people don't stop getting their hair cut.
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.360]  You know, if anything, they need it more around the holidays for parties and stuff.
[03:51.520 --> 03:54.720]  And so she can't just like it's not a nine to five where you walk away.
[03:54.820 --> 03:58.240]  You know, she has to cram those people in before she can take off.
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.580]  And so she always gets like bronchitis or the flu or a cold or something because she's
[04:03.580 --> 04:04.520]  working like 12 hour days.
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.500]  So she is dying, but still having to work 12 hours a day.
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.120]  Albert somehow, even though he has his vaccination, got kennel cough.
[04:13.740 --> 04:16.220]  Oh, at the puppy daycare place.
[04:16.240 --> 04:17.160]  I don't think I mentioned that to y'all.
[04:17.160 --> 04:23.360]  So Albert has been dying and like you have to watch him to make sure because as bulldogs,
[04:23.460 --> 04:30.060]  if anything impacts their airways, they can or like any kind of regurg is really dangerous
[04:30.060 --> 04:30.460]  for them.
[04:30.600 --> 04:35.140]  Like you cannot let bulldogs throw up because they'll get if their airway gets constricted
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.880]  at all, they'll get bronchitis almost immediately and they can die.
[04:37.960 --> 04:40.220]  That's what happened to Henry near the end.
[04:40.300 --> 04:43.300]  We had to rush him to the emergency room and they had to put him in like they put him in
[04:43.300 --> 04:47.360]  like an air chamber, you know, where they're like pushing air into him to keep him safe.
[04:47.860 --> 04:52.260]  And so I got to like check Albert every three hours, make sure his gums are pink and shit.
[04:52.380 --> 04:55.960]  And like he's on the mend and all this time I've been going through the mouth stuff and
[04:55.960 --> 05:01.640]  I've just been, you know, quietly miserable trying to take care of my family.
[05:02.220 --> 05:08.040]  This fucking yesterday, day before yesterday, the Christmas presents I ordered for you guys
[05:08.040 --> 05:08.420]  came in.
[05:08.720 --> 05:09.780]  I was very excited.
[05:09.940 --> 05:13.220]  Andrew, yours didn't, obviously, because I had to ship it to Canada and yours is a little
[05:13.220 --> 05:13.580]  different.
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.420]  Let me just let you know what I got.
[05:15.540 --> 05:17.580]  Everybody else wasn't available to go to Canada.
[05:17.620 --> 05:20.160]  So I got you something unique and different and it should arrive today.
[05:20.720 --> 05:25.320]  But I got the boxes in and then I realized I'd gotten presents for Andrew.
[05:25.480 --> 05:26.200]  Yours was on the way.
[05:26.480 --> 05:28.240]  Gavin, Nick and Eric.
[05:29.080 --> 05:30.340]  And so I got one of each.
[05:30.740 --> 05:33.100]  They arrived in two boxes and I thought, that's weird.
[05:33.600 --> 05:38.560]  And I realized, no, there's only one of each in the boxes.
[05:38.660 --> 05:39.600]  So I'm short one.
[05:40.280 --> 05:41.440]  Eric and Nick were together.
[05:41.440 --> 05:45.660]  So as soon as I got it, because it's refrigerated, I drove over and gave them their presents.
[05:45.980 --> 05:49.860]  And then I went home and I was trying to figure out where the other box was.
[05:49.920 --> 05:52.620]  And I'll be honest, Gold Belly, I got it from Gold Belly.
[05:52.660 --> 05:53.700]  Gold Belly was down.
[05:54.120 --> 05:55.980]  The app was down and I couldn't see and I freaked out.
[05:56.060 --> 05:57.400]  And so I bought another one.
[05:57.440 --> 05:59.060]  I thought maybe I screwed up and I only bought two.
[05:59.240 --> 06:01.440]  So I bought another one for Gavin.
[06:02.360 --> 06:04.320]  Why did you, why did you freak out?
[06:04.640 --> 06:07.620]  Because I didn't want Gavin not to have a gift that I'd already delivered y'alls.
[06:08.620 --> 06:09.740]  And you know what I mean?
[06:09.740 --> 06:12.160]  He's like my fucking very best friend on earth.
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.600]  I don't want him to get slighted.
[06:13.700 --> 06:15.360]  And so, yeah, of course, buddy.
[06:15.640 --> 06:19.120]  And so I, uh, I ordered one more for Gavin.
[06:19.180 --> 06:23.280]  I thought if Gavin's was like late, uh, for some reason it didn't ship at the same time
[06:23.280 --> 06:24.300]  or whatever, no big deal.
[06:24.380 --> 06:26.480]  I'll have one for me or I'll give it to somebody else.
[06:28.460 --> 06:30.180]  Yesterday, I got four of them.
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.820]  I got the one for Gavin and the three additional I apparently ordered when I thought I was
[06:34.820 --> 06:35.920]  ordering one for Gavin.
[06:37.720 --> 06:42.640]  And so now I have four of these gifts to give three people, six of these gifts to give
[06:42.640 --> 06:43.060]  three people.
[06:43.140 --> 06:44.140]  It's quite a big gift.
[06:44.460 --> 06:44.820]  Yeah.
[06:45.400 --> 06:49.100]  And so it's refrigerated and this isn't like seven o'clock at night.
[06:49.180 --> 06:50.840]  I'm not driving this shit around at seven o'clock at night.
[06:50.880 --> 06:52.240]  I'm still not quite sure what to do with it.
[06:52.620 --> 06:57.980]  So, uh, so I have to take and unbox the gifts.
[06:58.260 --> 07:02.680]  I have to take everything out of the packages, the ceiling and everything because it's refrigerated
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.280]  and I got to put it into my refrigerator.
[07:04.280 --> 07:06.940]  So I got to clean my refrigerator completely out.
[07:07.240 --> 07:11.840]  Actually, I say I, Emily did a lot of this work and you have to come clean the refrigerator
[07:11.840 --> 07:17.120]  completely out to completely disassemble your gifts to then cram them in to the fridge.
[07:17.260 --> 07:21.000]  And so this morning and I'm also still a one car family because there's a my car's been
[07:21.000 --> 07:21.700]  in the shop for three weeks.
[07:21.780 --> 07:22.740]  I don't know if I mentioned that to you guys.
[07:23.260 --> 07:26.160]  And so sorry, Gavin, your car has been in the shop for three weeks because they cannot
[07:26.160 --> 07:26.820]  fix this.
[07:27.080 --> 07:28.300]  They cannot fix the speaker.
[07:28.600 --> 07:32.220]  The fucking speaker is causing all kinds of problems at BMW.
[07:32.220 --> 07:34.040]  They can't figure out how to fix a speaker in a door.
[07:35.380 --> 07:40.180]  Uh, it's, it's, you know, speakers indoors were so complicated and convoluted and had
[07:40.180 --> 07:42.680]  so many moving parts that have to be replaced and tested.
[07:43.400 --> 07:47.920]  Uh, anyway, so I get up this morning, I drive Emily to work and then I drop her off and
[07:47.920 --> 07:53.700]  then I get myself a taco and then I race home and I take all of the gifts out of the fridge
[07:53.700 --> 07:57.840]  and then I have to reassemble the boxes and the packages and put them all back together
[07:57.840 --> 07:59.440]  the way they fit and cram them in.
[07:59.740 --> 08:02.240]  And then I drove and I have four packages.
[08:02.360 --> 08:03.140]  I keep one for myself.
[08:03.360 --> 08:07.940]  I drive one to Gavin and then I drive one to Bernie and Vanessa, drop one off at their
[08:07.940 --> 08:10.080]  house because I love them dearly and I want them to enjoy this.
[08:10.160 --> 08:13.340]  And then I take the other one to my cousin and his husband and let them have it.
[08:13.600 --> 08:17.620]  And then at some point while I'm driving around, I get like a notification on Simply
[08:17.620 --> 08:19.100]  Safe that's like, power's out at your house.
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.200]  Actually, I didn't get the notification.
[08:20.340 --> 08:20.780]  Emily did.
[08:20.860 --> 08:21.720]  And I go, oh, that's weird.
[08:22.200 --> 08:23.220]  And she's like, are you at home?
[08:23.300 --> 08:23.700]  What's going on?
[08:23.720 --> 08:24.840]  And I go, no, I don't think so.
[08:25.620 --> 08:27.740]  Uh, Millie's there, but no, I'm not aware of any power outage.
[08:27.740 --> 08:29.500]  I don't actually get the Simply Safe notification.
[08:29.620 --> 08:29.980]  She does.
[08:30.180 --> 08:31.080]  Then she goes, never mind.
[08:31.140 --> 08:31.820]  It's back on immediately.
[08:31.940 --> 08:32.780]  I'm like, okay, whatever.
[08:32.860 --> 08:33.200]  No problem.
[08:33.540 --> 08:36.880]  So I finished because you guys all live so fucking far away from each other, by the way.
[08:36.900 --> 08:40.540]  You and Chris and Bernie and Vanessa are not close.
[08:41.320 --> 08:46.500]  And, uh, and so after like two hours of driving all around, I come home, take care of the
[08:46.860 --> 08:52.500]  dog, have some soda, uh, kind of get comfortable, say good morning to Millie and stuff.
[08:52.760 --> 08:55.420]  Come in here because I got to do a couple of thumbnails for Nick.
[08:55.740 --> 08:56.900]  Sit down to do the thumbnails.
[08:56.900 --> 08:59.400]  My Xbox is off and I think, oh, that's weird.
[08:59.760 --> 09:00.040]  I didn't.
[09:00.160 --> 09:00.640]  I left it on.
[09:00.720 --> 09:02.520]  So I was playing Call of Duty and then I go, oh, wait a minute.
[09:02.560 --> 09:03.320]  No, the power went out.
[09:03.380 --> 09:03.640]  That's right.
[09:03.680 --> 09:04.340]  My Xbox is off.
[09:04.420 --> 09:05.060]  Everything is off.
[09:05.240 --> 09:06.280]  So I turn on my Mac.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.480]  I turn on the my Xbox and stuff.
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.460]  Turn on my PC.
[09:09.740 --> 09:10.840]  Start logging into the Mac.
[09:10.960 --> 09:13.480]  Turn around to go pick up the Xbox controller to play a game of Call of Duty.
[09:13.740 --> 09:14.980]  Realize that the screen's not on.
[09:15.000 --> 09:15.600]  I'm like, that's weird.
[09:15.980 --> 09:17.520]  Hit the power button on my PC again.
[09:17.600 --> 09:17.900]  Nothing.
[09:18.160 --> 09:18.600]  Hit it again.
[09:18.700 --> 09:18.940]  Nothing.
[09:19.200 --> 09:19.840]  That's weird.
[09:21.060 --> 09:23.260]  Uh, start the process of unplugging and plugging in.
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.420]  I got bad power supply.
[09:24.420 --> 09:28.160]  I think that whatever that power outage was today nuked my fucking PC.
[09:28.420 --> 09:32.520]  So now I can no longer capture any kind of game footage.
[09:33.140 --> 09:34.100]  Oh, man.
[09:34.200 --> 09:39.680]  Now we're OK because we are we're doing live action tomorrow and we don't have any
[09:39.680 --> 09:41.320]  game capture this week.
[09:41.380 --> 09:44.060]  So I have this from today to this weekend to figure it out.
[09:44.140 --> 09:48.920]  So then I'm like, I'm 20 years past being a computer guy, right?
[09:49.020 --> 09:50.300]  15 years past being a computer guy.
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.860]  But I pull the power supply out and I make sure it's definitely not turning on.
[09:53.860 --> 09:58.920]  You know, I try everything I can think of different outlets, different power cables.
[09:59.060 --> 10:00.920]  It clearly seems to be a busted power supply.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.600]  That's fine because my computer was making a weird noise a while ago and I thought it
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.820]  might have been a fan on the power supply.
[10:05.860 --> 10:07.620]  So I'm looking at it and I don't understand.
[10:07.980 --> 10:10.180]  I don't understand the back of a fucking power supply now.
[10:10.320 --> 10:13.420]  I just take pictures of everything so I know where to plug it back in.
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.360]  And I Google it.
[10:15.580 --> 10:19.880]  It's a Corsair 850 and there's a million of them and I can even get one today.
[10:19.900 --> 10:20.960]  And I'm like, this is fucking awesome.
[10:21.080 --> 10:21.960]  And so I start looking at them.
[10:21.960 --> 10:23.020]  And of course, they're all new.
[10:23.020 --> 10:27.200]  And the backs look totally different, like not even the same shit.
[10:27.240 --> 10:30.220]  And I'm like, oh, this I'm officially too dumb to solve this.
[10:30.640 --> 10:33.500]  I bought this PC from Origin PC in 2020.
[10:33.740 --> 10:36.860]  I doubt it's under warranty, but I bet they can at least point me in the right direction.
[10:37.320 --> 10:40.240]  Maybe I can buy a power supply for them or they can help me get the right one.
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.400]  So I call up their support.
[10:43.120 --> 10:45.080]  Useless, useless, unhelpful people.
[10:45.880 --> 10:49.220]  I love the Origin PC and I will buy another one.
[10:49.220 --> 10:53.420]  The conversation on the phone wasn't bad enough to make me not support the product anymore,
[10:53.580 --> 10:58.120]  but they got to do some work in their customer service and their tech support department.
[10:58.260 --> 11:01.240]  The guy was extremely unfriendly and unwilling to help.
[11:01.300 --> 11:03.480]  And I'm like, I'm just telling you they look different.
[11:03.500 --> 11:04.480]  And he's like, no, they don't.
[11:04.560 --> 11:07.560]  And I'm like, sir, I'm looking at one in my hand and a picture on the Internet.
[11:07.600 --> 11:08.960]  And I'm telling you the backs are different.
[11:09.160 --> 11:09.900]  I'm an idiot.
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.100]  I just need you to tell me if I buy the new one.
[11:12.120 --> 11:12.540]  Am I OK?
[11:12.760 --> 11:13.560]  Can I buy one?
[11:13.620 --> 11:16.320]  I eventually had to hang up on the guy because he was no fucking help.
[11:17.020 --> 11:22.740]  Buy a refurbished one online because it looks exactly like the one I have on my desk right now.
[11:23.200 --> 11:27.460]  It's not going to get here till somewhere between December 27th and January 3rd.
[11:27.660 --> 11:29.460]  That is not acceptable for me.
[11:29.820 --> 11:34.720]  So I bought another one at Best Buy as soon as we're done recording a brand new one.
[11:34.780 --> 11:38.880]  I'm going to drive up to Best Buy and pick it up and then come home and try to figure
[11:38.880 --> 11:42.960]  out how to plug shit into a system that looks totally different than what I have.
[11:43.200 --> 11:45.720]  And if that doesn't work and the refurbished one doesn't work,
[11:45.720 --> 11:46.860]  I guess I buy a new computer.
[11:47.040 --> 11:49.680]  But this is me letting you guys know that I'm not going to be able to capture any
[11:49.680 --> 11:53.720]  gameplay for the next couple of days unless I figure out this fucking power supply problem
[11:53.720 --> 11:55.400]  that I'm too stupid to figure out.
[11:55.460 --> 11:56.500]  And that's been my morning.
[11:57.100 --> 11:57.880]  Should I come over later?
[11:58.520 --> 11:59.080]  Maybe, yeah.
[11:59.160 --> 12:00.280]  After I go get the power supply.
[12:00.860 --> 12:02.820]  Can you just type in the number on the power supply?
[12:03.260 --> 12:03.740]  I did.
[12:03.840 --> 12:04.180]  I did.
[12:04.220 --> 12:04.860]  It just looks different.
[12:05.060 --> 12:06.660]  Like the new version of it looks different.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.280]  I even typed in the model number and stuff.
[12:08.320 --> 12:11.780]  I was only able to find one refurbished one on the Corsair website, which I bought.
[12:12.060 --> 12:13.540]  But that's the one that won't be here for two weeks.
[12:13.960 --> 12:14.800]  Which part looks different?
[12:14.800 --> 12:15.880]  The inside part.
[12:16.020 --> 12:18.120]  No, all this shit that plugs in on the back is different.
[12:18.520 --> 12:19.140]  Different order.
[12:19.300 --> 12:20.440]  Different nomenclature.
[12:20.940 --> 12:22.980]  Different... I think the names don't even match up.
[12:23.320 --> 12:26.420]  I just want this to turn into Gavin looking at it and going,
[12:26.680 --> 12:27.480]  no, they don't look different.
[12:28.060 --> 12:28.620]  No, they're the same.
[12:28.860 --> 12:35.240]  There's nothing on the new Corsair that says 6 plus 2 PCIe and 4 by 4 CPU.
[12:35.600 --> 12:38.360]  There's nothing that says 24 pin and ATX.
[12:38.560 --> 12:43.300]  There's nothing that says 6 plus 2 PCIe plus 4B4 CPU.
[12:43.380 --> 12:44.160]  It's all different.
[12:44.160 --> 12:46.160]  There's stuff that says peripheral and SATA.
[12:46.760 --> 12:47.520]  That's the same.
[12:48.120 --> 12:50.340]  Yeah, but as long as it's got the same looking plugs.
[12:50.640 --> 12:51.460]  They're in different orders.
[12:51.780 --> 12:53.340]  Like, they're in totally different places.
[12:53.500 --> 12:55.360]  If they even looked the same, I'd be fine.
[12:55.700 --> 12:57.040]  I just don't know what to plug in where.
[12:57.120 --> 12:57.640]  I took pictures.
[12:57.820 --> 12:58.940]  I hope it's the same.
[12:59.000 --> 12:59.760]  It comes with cables.
[12:59.840 --> 13:01.200]  I'm sure it'll fucking work.
[13:01.360 --> 13:04.020]  But then, even after I get this figured out and plugged in,
[13:04.100 --> 13:05.260]  I don't know that the computer works.
[13:05.320 --> 13:07.120]  I don't know that it didn't fry everything in the computer.
[13:07.480 --> 13:10.300]  I think this is just the first step in getting the goddamn thing turned back on,
[13:10.340 --> 13:10.920]  you know what I mean?
[13:11.080 --> 13:13.140]  I didn't even think about that shit.
[13:13.140 --> 13:15.920]  Yeah, I've now bought two power supplies for a computer
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.340]  I don't know that'll ever work again.
[13:17.660 --> 13:21.560]  Just because I'm desperate to not be down when we need to work.
[13:21.680 --> 13:23.000]  That's like, you know, that's like...
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.380]  That is my biggest fear on earth, I think.
[13:27.760 --> 13:30.300]  Cancer and being down and not able to work.
[13:31.140 --> 13:31.940]  And so...
[13:31.940 --> 13:32.280]  And snakes.
[13:32.440 --> 13:32.780]  Those three.
[13:32.900 --> 13:36.080]  Snakes, cancer, being down and not able to work.
[13:36.160 --> 13:36.720]  In that order.
[13:37.720 --> 13:40.260]  Nah, maybe snakes, being down, cancer would be the order.
[13:40.660 --> 13:42.220]  But yeah, yeah, I think that's...
[13:42.220 --> 13:44.140]  Yeah, that's got to be my top three.
[13:44.420 --> 13:46.420]  So I'm in my top three fear zones here.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.340]  I'm not thinking straight.
[13:48.440 --> 13:49.220]  I'm not happy.
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.640]  I'm flustered and frustrated.
[13:50.800 --> 13:55.380]  I have to get past this problem or I won't have a moment of peace in my life.
[13:55.840 --> 14:00.520]  My brain will not let me live comfortably until it's fixed or I buy a new computer.
[14:01.220 --> 14:03.140]  I would say, why did you have a UPS?
[14:03.260 --> 14:08.000]  But I had that EMP on stream a few months ago that just flew right through mine, so...
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.380]  I was gonna buy a UPS with this, but I don't know if it fucking matters because of your experience.
[14:14.020 --> 14:14.700]  Yeah, you're nice.
[14:15.300 --> 14:17.120]  Well, yeah, I can come and pluck shit in.
[14:17.400 --> 14:17.820]  All right, man.
[14:17.980 --> 14:18.600]  I appreciate that.
[14:19.160 --> 14:20.980]  Also, did you get your Christmas present?
[14:21.400 --> 14:21.780]  I did.
[14:21.860 --> 14:23.300]  I moved it swiftly to the fridge.
[14:23.480 --> 14:23.960]  Okay, good.
[14:24.020 --> 14:27.040]  Well, now everybody but Andrew has theirs, but Andrew, yours is different.
[14:27.160 --> 14:34.200]  So I can say, happy holidays and Merry Christmas to my regulation best friends and co-workers
[14:34.200 --> 14:35.320]  and business partners.
[14:35.460 --> 14:37.040]  I love you all so much.
[14:37.040 --> 14:38.380]  I love you so dearly.
[14:38.520 --> 14:43.500]  This has been the year in many ways, I think, of the hot dog.
[14:43.800 --> 14:51.160]  And so I wanted to spread Christmas cheer, kind of like the hot dog Santa, who was a real figure
[14:51.160 --> 14:55.320]  in the 1920s and the 1930s, who I talk about on Saul Wright, I think, next week's episode.
[14:55.640 --> 14:57.460]  I wanted to give the gift of hot dogs.
[14:57.620 --> 15:04.280]  So I sent you guys packages from Grey's Papaya, which is a place that Meg took me and Emily and
[15:04.780 --> 15:07.080]  Gavin to in New York that we absolutely loved.
[15:07.300 --> 15:09.020]  And so, yeah, that's what I got you guys.
[15:09.080 --> 15:10.360]  And then Andrew, yours is totally different.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.540]  So I'm not going to end the year on one.
[15:13.760 --> 15:14.360]  I thought I was.
[15:15.000 --> 15:15.580]  Oh, you better not.
[15:15.660 --> 15:17.540]  You better end it on 12 or however many I got you.
[15:18.560 --> 15:19.760]  Am I going to get a power supply?
[15:20.780 --> 15:22.820]  Yeah, but the plugs are all fucked up, dude.
[15:22.820 --> 15:27.240]  I don't know if it's a refurbished one or a new one, but you're going to get whichever one doesn't work.
[15:27.240 --> 15:27.320]  Hell yeah.
[15:28.080 --> 15:28.260]  What?
[15:28.880 --> 15:31.340]  No, I just couldn't get Grey's Papaya to Canada.
[15:31.460 --> 15:32.460]  That's why I didn't send you something different.
[15:32.460 --> 15:32.740]  Update!
[15:33.960 --> 15:37.000]  As this episode is going on, Nick has updated his hot dog count.
[15:37.200 --> 15:37.840]  Are you serious?
[15:37.960 --> 15:39.100]  Are you eating hot dogs right now?
[15:39.520 --> 15:40.040]  Not right now.
[15:40.100 --> 15:42.160]  I forgot about it the other night when I had them because I was like,
[15:42.180 --> 15:44.200]  oh, I'll wait until Gavin has his before I do.
[15:45.580 --> 15:52.280]  Also, to send three of you hot dogs packages, the price was the exact same.
[15:52.480 --> 15:54.760]  To give you an idea of the difference in America and Canada post,
[15:54.880 --> 15:56.240]  and this is something that we're all bitching about.
[15:57.300 --> 15:58.460]  It was cheaper.
[15:58.700 --> 16:00.640]  I think it was, I don't want to put a price tag on it,
[16:00.640 --> 16:03.420]  but let's say $100 for each package, right?
[16:03.460 --> 16:03.960]  Across the board.
[16:04.040 --> 16:06.480]  Like if Andrew's was $100, y'all's was $100 across the board, right?
[16:07.000 --> 16:10.680]  To get the three of your packages sent to my house so I could distribute them
[16:10.680 --> 16:20.260]  was still cheaper at $300 plus shipping than it was to send Andrew's one $100 package,
[16:20.460 --> 16:25.820]  which costs something like four times the price of the product just to send it to him.
[16:25.940 --> 16:26.820]  Oh my God.
[16:26.820 --> 16:30.560]  Just to further illustrate that we have got to figure out
[16:30.560 --> 16:34.920]  how to send mail back and forth between our countries in a cost-effective way,
[16:34.960 --> 16:37.720]  because it just keeps getting worse every time you do it.
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.140]  Oh, don't worry. I'm sure it's just about to get better, man.
[16:41.240 --> 16:44.780]  I'm sure we're just right on the cusp of it getting so good.
[16:45.060 --> 16:49.260]  I was just amazed it was cheaper to send three things,
[16:49.940 --> 16:54.240]  three gifts to America than one gift to Canada for the exact same price.
[16:54.500 --> 16:56.080]  Is the postal strike over, Andrew?
[16:57.260 --> 17:02.940]  Sort of like it. They've been forced back to work because of the season
[17:03.800 --> 17:07.340]  and they've been given permission to strike again in like May.
[17:07.660 --> 17:13.460]  I don't know if that's how strikes work, and I hope that people understand that.
[17:13.740 --> 17:17.240]  Hey, this is too inconvenient for us, so you just need to get back to it.
[17:17.520 --> 17:19.660]  Is there a Canadian polite strike?
[17:20.940 --> 17:25.760]  The Canada Post workers, not a fan, not happy with the decision that the government had made.
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.600]  The postal worker said strike, eh? And the government said strike, nay.
[17:32.800 --> 17:34.120]  You've been keeping up with our politics.
[17:36.640 --> 17:39.800]  I know you've zoned out of the U.S. politics. You've moved on to Canada,
[17:39.960 --> 17:42.320]  clearly. You're all in on Canada politics.
[17:42.660 --> 17:48.340]  I almost... I tuned to NPR yesterday on my radio on accident. I flipped over and I went,
[17:48.380 --> 17:50.380]  oh, what am I doing? I fucking switched away to sports immediately.
[17:50.780 --> 17:52.820]  I didn't hear... I was still in a commercial, so I didn't hear anything.
[17:53.020 --> 17:54.400]  How did you hear it without a door speaker?
[17:54.400 --> 17:56.000]  I'm in Emily's car.
[17:56.840 --> 18:00.560]  Good, cool. Yeah, I was surprised when I came to the podcast today that
[18:00.560 --> 18:02.360]  Andrew wasn't there for pleasantries.
[18:02.920 --> 18:04.580]  Yeah, I showed up early.
[18:05.380 --> 18:05.520]  What?
[18:05.740 --> 18:08.540]  I showed up for pleasantries. What do you mean?
[18:09.300 --> 18:11.340]  I was shocked you were there before I was.
[18:11.880 --> 18:14.400]  Well, that's because you were on time and Gavin was early.
[18:14.900 --> 18:15.160]  Right.
[18:15.600 --> 18:16.840]  Yeah, but Andrew wasn't early.
[18:17.700 --> 18:23.040]  Right. That's why I said you were on time and Gavin was early when I was talking to Andrew.
[18:23.460 --> 18:23.820]  Right.
[18:24.400 --> 18:27.140]  Yeah. I mean, I showed up 10.58. There's typically...
[18:27.140 --> 18:31.040]  even when I show up two minutes before we record, there's a little bit of pleasantries.
[18:31.400 --> 18:32.920]  Was it 10.58 when he showed up?
[18:33.280 --> 18:33.720]  It was.
[18:33.880 --> 18:34.100]  I don't think so.
[18:34.480 --> 18:36.760]  I don't... I don't think...
[18:36.760 --> 18:36.960]  I looked at the clock.
[18:38.660 --> 18:42.720]  I know it was 10.58 because I saw Gavin in there and I went, what the fuck?
[18:42.740 --> 18:45.540]  And I looked at the timer in the bottom right. It said 10.58.
[18:46.060 --> 18:48.140]  And I joined to be like, what's going on?
[18:48.380 --> 18:48.880]  The timer.
[18:49.100 --> 18:52.620]  I was here half an hour early just hoping somebody was going to show up.
[18:53.040 --> 18:55.680]  I've never met somebody who calls the clock the timer.
[18:58.800 --> 19:00.480]  I just looked at my waveform.
[19:00.860 --> 19:05.340]  I didn't take a breath from four minutes to 14 minutes of this podcast.
[19:05.520 --> 19:06.280]  Jesus Christ.
[19:06.460 --> 19:08.280]  You really wanted to let us know.
[19:08.780 --> 19:08.820]  My apologies.
[19:08.820 --> 19:10.360]  No, no, no need to apologize.
[19:10.620 --> 19:11.800]  You had a lot to get through.
[19:11.940 --> 19:13.740]  Yeah, I don't... I don't blame you.
[19:14.280 --> 19:14.940]  Not at all.
[19:15.320 --> 19:15.940]  Oh, God.
[19:16.440 --> 19:18.900]  This is... we've discussed before.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.240]  Therapy, essentially, for us.
[19:20.660 --> 19:22.240]  And that was clearly a session.
[19:22.240 --> 19:26.180]  I think it's great that you got it all out, because last time it was us talking about
[19:26.180 --> 19:27.680]  the most soupable marsupial.
[19:27.860 --> 19:28.360]  So I get this.
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.700]  It's a nice change of pace, I guess, when you get into it.
[19:31.760 --> 19:32.200]  You know what I mean?
[19:32.600 --> 19:32.960]  Yeah.
[19:33.460 --> 19:36.700]  People think I'm pretty off base with the old... the bagel analysis.
[19:36.700 --> 19:36.980]  Do they?
[19:37.680 --> 19:38.040]  Yeah.
[19:38.560 --> 19:39.080]  Oh, no.
[19:39.920 --> 19:42.880]  I think I'm just going to get... I'm going to get some East Coast bagels down my gut.
[19:43.300 --> 19:45.840]  I... you know, I think it's... what about the spread?
[19:46.220 --> 19:48.120]  I think there's a lot of factors to this.
[19:48.120 --> 19:50.560]  Well, I think the biggest factor is that these people are
[19:51.200 --> 19:56.060]  placing their own local bagel biases against Gavin's.
[19:56.200 --> 19:59.100]  If you're on the East Coast, of course, you're going to get better bagels.
[19:59.300 --> 20:02.600]  They're amazing on the East Coast, but that's not the reality that Gavin lives in.
[20:02.720 --> 20:06.660]  Gavin lives in Austin, Texas, which is a mediocre at best bagel town.
[20:06.920 --> 20:10.200]  And so for what's available to him, I think his decision makes total sense.
[20:10.780 --> 20:13.380]  I just... I think bagels are really fun food.
[20:14.140 --> 20:14.500]  I agree.
[20:14.500 --> 20:18.980]  To be... to cancel bagels from your life, I just think it's sad.
[20:19.320 --> 20:21.640]  Well, why don't we... why don't you make me a bagel?
[20:22.200 --> 20:22.480]  Me?
[20:23.040 --> 20:23.280]  Yeah.
[20:23.440 --> 20:24.940]  Oh, you won't like my bagel.
[20:25.240 --> 20:28.880]  This is like last time where you asked him, what was his bagel order?
[20:29.020 --> 20:30.140]  And he said, what do you mean?
[20:30.460 --> 20:32.520]  And then it's, why don't you make me a bagel?
[20:32.920 --> 20:33.180]  Me?
[20:33.920 --> 20:34.240]  Great.
[20:35.300 --> 20:38.220]  No, listen, you're not going to like... not going to like my bagels.
[20:38.600 --> 20:39.140]  How do you know?
[20:39.660 --> 20:40.540]  Because I know you.
[20:40.820 --> 20:42.560]  Listen, we did 24 days of snacking.
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.120]  The last bagel he designed shut a business down, dude.
[20:47.500 --> 20:49.400]  I wouldn't say that, but...
[20:51.860 --> 20:52.340]  Um...
[20:52.340 --> 20:55.300]  Yeah, I like a plain... I'm a pretty plain bagel guy.
[20:55.640 --> 21:01.840]  So I don't think that my bagel preferences would sway you in any way.
[21:02.240 --> 21:09.140]  But I do think you need to figure out what exactly you think is the ideal spread or topping on a bagel.
[21:09.560 --> 21:10.920]  Because it might not just be the bagel.
[21:10.920 --> 21:13.480]  It might be you, you just don't, you haven't found that match yet.
[21:13.580 --> 21:16.480]  The pair between the bagel itself and what is on.
[21:17.160 --> 21:20.960]  What if, using sliced pineapple, I made a fruit bagel?
[21:23.160 --> 21:24.840]  It'd be goopy and wet.
[21:25.380 --> 21:25.600]  Yeah.
[21:26.240 --> 21:31.300]  I'm not sure what... why is it a bagel?
[21:31.820 --> 21:33.920]  Because there's a hole in the middle, I think it's...
[21:35.640 --> 21:37.020]  Is a donut a bagel?
[21:39.120 --> 21:40.140]  It's just like...
[21:40.140 --> 21:40.760]  Is it more of a donut?
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.720]  What's the like...
[21:42.720 --> 21:46.000]  I would say a pineapple ring is more bagel to donut.
[21:46.260 --> 21:48.120]  Would you call it a pineagle or a...
[21:50.200 --> 21:50.640]  Banapple?
[21:52.740 --> 21:55.260]  Banapple sounds like a banana apple kind of thing.
[21:55.340 --> 21:56.860]  Why don't we put it to the internet?
[21:57.140 --> 21:57.780]  We'll put a poll.
[21:58.100 --> 22:02.060]  Is a pineapple ring a fruit bagel or a fruit donut?
[22:03.600 --> 22:09.280]  I think it should just say what is a pineapple and then you could just put a bagel or a donut.
[22:09.280 --> 22:14.200]  I don't think you need to explain anything about what you're trying to get specific about.
[22:14.460 --> 22:16.500]  You just ask people if it's a bagel or a donut.
[22:17.520 --> 22:20.000]  I mean, it's pretty sweet.
[22:20.140 --> 22:20.980]  I would think it'd be...
[22:20.980 --> 22:22.720]  It would be so sticky on the fingers.
[22:22.880 --> 22:23.400]  I hate it.
[22:23.680 --> 22:23.800]  I hate it.
[22:24.400 --> 22:28.020]  Gav, do you want to make one tomorrow when we're making the potagel?
[22:28.340 --> 22:29.200]  I think I do.
[22:29.420 --> 22:32.520]  And I think the way we finish it will determine what it is.
[22:32.540 --> 22:34.460]  Like if you dunk the whole thing in chocolate, that's a donut.
[22:34.460 --> 22:41.020]  But if I put on like strips of... what's a strippable fruit?
[22:42.960 --> 22:43.740]  Uh, orange?
[22:43.860 --> 22:44.640]  Most fruit.
[22:45.120 --> 22:45.360]  Banana?
[22:46.140 --> 22:46.700]  Yeah.
[22:46.920 --> 22:51.800]  If I like put that on top, like open face to the pineapple, that's more of a bagel.
[22:51.900 --> 22:52.240]  Okay.
[22:52.620 --> 22:57.580]  I'm going to open a 30 minute poll on the Regulation Podcast Twitter account.
[22:58.720 --> 22:59.860]  I am... it's 30 minutes.
[23:00.480 --> 23:02.500]  The question is, what is a pineapple?
[23:02.500 --> 23:03.880]  Choice one, bagel.
[23:04.060 --> 23:04.820]  Choice two, donut.
[23:05.040 --> 23:06.620]  Is there anything I need to change about that?
[23:07.640 --> 23:08.420]  I don't think so.
[23:08.560 --> 23:09.600]  Okay, it's posted.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.100]  There you go.
[23:11.240 --> 23:13.700]  We'll check in in 30 minutes and see what you...
[23:14.940 --> 23:15.600]  I will say...
[23:15.600 --> 23:19.900]  What is a pineapple, bagel or donut?
[23:20.440 --> 23:25.700]  Not to completely leave the pineapple, I too put out a poll last week, I believe.
[23:25.880 --> 23:26.260]  Uh-huh.
[23:26.420 --> 23:29.880]  Trying to determine who's more of a bat guy, Bruce Wayne or Batman.
[23:30.200 --> 23:30.820]  Saw that.
[23:31.400 --> 23:32.460]  I was wrong.
[23:34.100 --> 23:36.780]  But it was a lot closer than I would have thought.
[23:36.920 --> 23:38.360]  Like, I kind of felt I was wrong.
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.160]  A lot of people bringing up a great point that Bruce Wayne was actually traumatized by bats
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.100]  and is definitely not a fan.
[23:45.440 --> 23:47.080]  That's what I said in the episode.
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.000]  Yeah, listen, I missed it.
[23:49.020 --> 23:51.380]  I was having a bad day when we recorded those.
[23:52.300 --> 23:53.340]  Just didn't hear it.
[23:53.420 --> 23:54.700]  He was having a bad day.
[23:56.640 --> 23:57.700]  Are you having a better day today?
[23:58.060 --> 23:59.540]  I'm having a way better day today.
[23:59.540 --> 24:01.580]  We're talking about pineapple rings and donuts.
[24:01.740 --> 24:02.420]  This is fucking great.
[24:03.280 --> 24:05.620]  Hey, so I'm gonna put together a shopping list for tomorrow.
[24:05.760 --> 24:09.020]  I have on it pineapple, potato, bagel.
[24:09.480 --> 24:10.720]  Is there anything else I need to get?
[24:11.400 --> 24:13.600]  Well, we've got... we need dogs and string.
[24:14.200 --> 24:15.100]  Dogs and string.
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.820]  We're not gonna waste papaya dogs.
[24:17.220 --> 24:18.660]  Dogs and string.
[24:18.880 --> 24:22.460]  And I think this is a conversation from our meeting on Monday.
[24:22.500 --> 24:27.940]  But I had the urge to film a live action bit where instead of doing the water bottle hanging
[24:27.940 --> 24:32.980]  from the fan ceiling fan challenge, I thought maybe we could tie two dogs to a ceiling fan
[24:32.980 --> 24:36.840]  and then two people have to blindfold eat a dog.
[24:37.180 --> 24:38.220]  It's a great idea.
[24:40.940 --> 24:46.340]  It's like, you know, that trend where people put blindfolds on and try to dodge the water bottles.
[24:46.780 --> 24:49.480]  It's like the reverse of that, where you're blindfolded,
[24:49.500 --> 24:51.440]  but you still have... you're trying to eat the dogs.
[24:51.780 --> 24:53.360]  You're trying to catch what's coming at you.
[24:53.700 --> 24:57.920]  At what point in the friendship did you stop listening to anything Gavin says?
[24:57.920 --> 24:59.480]  It's just like, I'm stunned.
[24:59.660 --> 25:00.980]  I'm like stunned.
[25:01.760 --> 25:02.800]  I don't know what's happening.
[25:02.880 --> 25:04.020]  I thought I was crazy.
[25:04.220 --> 25:04.780]  Thank God.
[25:04.940 --> 25:05.260]  What do you mean?
[25:06.000 --> 25:06.920]  Are you not doing a bit?
[25:07.120 --> 25:11.580]  He just fucking said it's like the water bottle thing, but he was describing it.
[25:11.900 --> 25:12.920]  Oh, you weren't kidding?
[25:13.120 --> 25:16.580]  I just thought you... I was waiting you out because you were doing a...
[25:16.580 --> 25:17.420]  Are you serious?
[25:18.060 --> 25:19.200]  Oh, I just didn't hear it.
[25:19.260 --> 25:19.700]  That's crazy.
[25:20.180 --> 25:23.060]  But you're replying to me and that's the... that's what I just said.
[25:24.180 --> 25:24.860]  I don't know.
[25:25.120 --> 25:25.240]  Listen.
[25:25.340 --> 25:26.500]  Who are you talking to?
[25:26.920 --> 25:27.280]  Hello?
[25:28.260 --> 25:29.640]  I'm running through the mountains of GTA.
[25:29.760 --> 25:30.820]  I got to put this controller down.
[25:30.920 --> 25:31.540]  This is...
[25:31.540 --> 25:33.140]  Wait, are you playing a video game?
[25:33.380 --> 25:34.440]  No, Cougar.
[25:34.600 --> 25:35.780]  I got to eat my Cougar.
[25:35.920 --> 25:37.480]  Oh, come on.
[25:37.840 --> 25:39.140]  Andrew, do the podcast.
[25:40.440 --> 25:41.260]  I'm fully focused.
[25:41.420 --> 25:42.080]  I'm fully locked in.
[25:42.260 --> 25:42.480]  Sorry.
[25:42.580 --> 25:43.020]  No, you're not.
[25:43.020 --> 25:44.020]  They added snow to GTA.
[25:44.160 --> 25:47.020]  I was just checking something because we're, you know, mini heists.
[25:47.020 --> 25:49.020]  I'd love to film something with you guys.
[25:49.500 --> 25:50.080]  It's been fun.
[25:50.440 --> 25:51.180]  I'm blown away.
[25:51.220 --> 25:51.820]  That wasn't a bit.
[25:52.560 --> 25:53.600]  No, I have...
[25:53.600 --> 25:54.260]  That was nuts.
[25:54.880 --> 25:55.360]  I will...
[25:55.360 --> 25:58.220]  Could you please clip that and send it to, like, play a next episode?
[25:58.340 --> 25:59.820]  Because that was...
[25:59.820 --> 26:00.380]  I missed it.
[26:00.760 --> 26:02.220]  I want to know how bad that was.
[26:03.120 --> 26:06.360]  It was so bad that I didn't react to it because I just thought it was funny.
[26:07.120 --> 26:07.920]  I thought...
[26:07.920 --> 26:09.700]  I thought I was going nuts.
[26:09.980 --> 26:11.000]  I thought that...
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.160]  I'm like, well, maybe he didn't say it.
[26:13.360 --> 26:13.720]  And then...
[26:13.720 --> 26:14.780]  Oh, thank God for Geoff.
[26:15.040 --> 26:15.400]  Wow.
[26:17.220 --> 26:18.060]  Oh, man.
[26:18.600 --> 26:18.960]  Wow.
[26:19.480 --> 26:20.000]  Yeah, that was strange.
[26:20.100 --> 26:21.440]  I thought you were having a better day today.
[26:21.820 --> 26:22.720]  I'm having a great day.
[26:23.220 --> 26:24.300]  I'm having too...
[26:24.300 --> 26:24.620]  Like...
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.280]  He's doing his job and then just playing a video game at the same time.
[26:29.340 --> 26:30.400]  Really locked in.
[26:30.440 --> 26:33.120]  I was checking to see something relating to work.
[26:33.300 --> 26:33.580]  Am I not?
[26:33.680 --> 26:37.820]  Not only did you repeat the thing that I had just said,
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.280]  it was right after me talking about you not listening to me.
[26:43.880 --> 26:44.900]  I didn't listen.
[26:45.640 --> 26:47.040]  Last time I was just...
[26:47.040 --> 26:47.120]  How do you listen?
[26:47.300 --> 26:48.500]  I was in a bad...
[26:49.040 --> 26:50.040]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[26:50.380 --> 26:50.620]  That's good.
[26:50.700 --> 26:51.000]  You know what?
[26:51.680 --> 26:53.320]  I'm not even going to say anything else after that.
[26:53.360 --> 26:53.660]  You're right.
[26:54.920 --> 26:55.780]  I need to be...
[26:56.420 --> 26:57.480]  Listen, man in the mirror.
[26:58.480 --> 26:59.000]  That's me.
[26:59.340 --> 27:00.140]  I know I did.
[27:00.280 --> 27:01.380]  I'm saying it to me in the mirror.
[27:01.480 --> 27:01.680]  Listen.
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.940]  I need to listen more.
[27:07.100 --> 27:09.300]  In my defense, I have none.
[27:09.880 --> 27:10.420]  That was bad.
[27:12.140 --> 27:13.040]  I should have...
[27:14.140 --> 27:14.660]  I don't know.
[27:14.700 --> 27:17.780]  It's weird to have committed a crime that you're not even aware you did.
[27:17.780 --> 27:22.640]  Like, I have zero awareness of how bad it was of what you said.
[27:22.680 --> 27:23.180]  I can't wait.
[27:23.320 --> 27:24.360]  I can't wait to hear it.
[27:27.440 --> 27:28.560]  Oh my god.
[27:28.580 --> 27:29.800]  Is that the first time that's happened?
[27:29.880 --> 27:32.140]  I feel like this has happened before, but with you to me.
[27:32.740 --> 27:34.800]  Uh, I mean, I've definitely been guilty of it.
[27:34.820 --> 27:39.580]  I just feel like not within the same 20 seconds that the thing's being said.
[27:39.740 --> 27:43.220]  The reply to the thing being the exact same thing that was just said.
[27:43.820 --> 27:44.120]  Yeah.
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.000]  How's the poll going?
[27:48.180 --> 27:52.080]  Well, it's been five minutes.
[27:52.460 --> 27:53.800]  Yeah, just you know, what's an update?
[27:54.160 --> 27:57.560]  Okay, it's 71% to 28%.
[27:57.560 --> 27:59.860]  So 71.4, 28.6.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.040]  What do you think is leading?
[28:02.480 --> 28:04.640]  Uh, I think Donut's leading.
[28:04.980 --> 28:05.680]  Okay, Gavin?
[28:06.640 --> 28:07.580]  Uh, yeah, I agree.
[28:07.980 --> 28:08.720]  Okay, Geoff?
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.400]  And Donut makes the most sense, but it's our audience and they already know about bagels.
[28:14.500 --> 28:15.940]  So I'm gonna say bagel.
[28:16.460 --> 28:17.440]  Yeah, it's Donut.
[28:18.280 --> 28:19.400]  Well, good, good.
[28:19.520 --> 28:19.620]  Yeah.
[28:20.580 --> 28:22.960]  It should, it should be Donut.
[28:23.040 --> 28:23.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:23.520 --> 28:25.620]  I mean, by a landslide right now, it's huge.
[28:26.220 --> 28:28.220]  Can we make a pineapple donut?
[28:28.420 --> 28:30.360]  Like dunk a pineapple ring in chocolate tomorrow?
[28:31.100 --> 28:31.920]  Well, let me get some...
[28:31.920 --> 28:33.560]  So we're gonna need like melted chocolate?
[28:34.280 --> 28:35.460]  Yeah, well, we can melt it.
[28:35.580 --> 28:37.340]  We don't have to melt it ourselves, but...
[28:37.780 --> 28:38.760]  Well, how are you gonna buy it melted?
[28:38.860 --> 28:40.020]  You're not gonna go to the chocolate store and say,
[28:40.220 --> 28:43.100]  give me a gallon of melted chocolate and give it to me hot.
[28:43.560 --> 28:44.200]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[28:44.600 --> 28:46.580]  I'll get melting chocolate and melt it.
[28:48.480 --> 28:51.840]  Just give them a bag of like chocolate chips and be like,
[28:51.940 --> 28:52.980]  can you melt this for me?
[28:53.260 --> 28:55.060]  Can I get this in liquid form, please?
[28:55.480 --> 28:56.520]  But why'd you have to buy melted?
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.720]  All chocolate melts.
[28:58.200 --> 29:03.160]  There's special chocolate that's designed to be melted for fucking desserts like this.
[29:03.220 --> 29:03.660]  You can buy.
[29:03.780 --> 29:07.020]  It comes in little discs that you do melt.
[29:10.600 --> 29:15.100]  It's like other than just like getting a bar of Hershey's and throwing it in a pot,
[29:15.140 --> 29:16.620]  you can just buy the melting chocolate.
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.920]  Yeah, I just, what's the point?
[29:18.840 --> 29:20.820]  What's the point of the more meltable chocolate?
[29:21.140 --> 29:22.340]  It's like buying chopping apples.
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.060]  How do you feel about like wood that is designed to be burnt like firewood?
[29:28.240 --> 29:28.640]  Designed?
[29:29.080 --> 29:30.960]  Well, you know what I mean? Like fireplace logs.
[29:32.200 --> 29:32.480]  Yeah.
[29:32.940 --> 29:36.460]  You fan of the fireplace log or do you think that's also pointless because there's trees everywhere?
[29:37.380 --> 29:41.420]  Well, isn't that for people who don't have lots of wood access to trees?
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.380]  I mean, you can get branches wherever you go.
[29:45.040 --> 29:45.880]  Walk in the woods.
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.560]  Go find some.
[29:49.160 --> 29:51.420]  Are branches free?
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.580]  Listen, I don't have a lot of money.
[29:56.700 --> 29:59.260]  I can't buy this Christmas tree, but I'll take four branches.
[29:59.560 --> 30:00.260]  How much is that?
[30:00.920 --> 30:06.080]  Like if there's a branch that's fallen off a tree on the ground out in the world, is that free?
[30:06.340 --> 30:07.740]  Is it on public or private land?
[30:08.600 --> 30:08.780]  Public.
[30:09.200 --> 30:09.700]  That's free?
[30:10.140 --> 30:12.220]  Yeah, ask, ask any dog.
[30:14.880 --> 30:18.400]  But if it's on the tree still, not free.
[30:18.800 --> 30:20.380]  Well, it depends on who's around.
[30:24.100 --> 30:26.000]  How bad do you want this branch?
[30:26.560 --> 30:27.540]  I'm not gonna keep warm.
[30:30.920 --> 30:32.040]  This is...
[30:32.040 --> 30:34.780]  You're scavenging for life in this scenario?
[30:35.660 --> 30:36.580]  What is going on?
[30:36.860 --> 30:41.260]  If it's a keep warm or die type situation, which is what you're framing,
[30:41.260 --> 30:42.100]  I don't know.
[30:42.180 --> 30:44.320]  I'd give a shit if it was somebody else's branch or not.
[30:44.380 --> 30:46.700]  I think at that point, it's the life-saving branch.
[30:48.520 --> 30:51.520]  I don't think Gavin could make a fire in the wild.
[30:52.760 --> 30:54.040]  Oh my god, dude.
[30:54.300 --> 30:54.500]  Wow.
[30:54.880 --> 30:56.340]  Emily asked me for...
[30:56.340 --> 30:59.780]  Last night, we were watching the season finale of Survivor, which by the way,
[31:00.200 --> 31:03.820]  one of the better seasons of Survivor I've seen in a long time.
[31:04.880 --> 31:07.140]  Really phenomenally strong ending.
[31:07.700 --> 31:11.800]  And Emily was saying that for her birthday, she wants to make fire like Survivor
[31:12.300 --> 31:14.140]  in the exact same way and see if she can do it.
[31:14.240 --> 31:17.560]  Maybe we should have a Survivor fire burning or fire-making contest.
[31:18.400 --> 31:18.840]  Yeah.
[31:19.360 --> 31:20.640]  I feel like I could make fire.
[31:21.100 --> 31:22.680]  Could you burn the string before I could?
[31:23.300 --> 31:23.540]  Yeah.
[31:23.540 --> 31:26.100]  I'm putting money on Geoff 100% of the way.
[31:26.280 --> 31:27.380]  No way.
[31:27.740 --> 31:29.460]  No way you're faster than Geoff.
[31:30.220 --> 31:33.380]  So can we set up four stations with the string and everything?
[31:33.840 --> 31:34.060]  Yeah.
[31:34.480 --> 31:36.200]  We just got to get all the tools.
[31:36.200 --> 31:37.400]  So what do we get?
[31:37.460 --> 31:41.940]  We get like a Rambo knife, like four Rambo knives, a little flint and steel thing.
[31:42.880 --> 31:43.760]  What do they call it?
[31:44.100 --> 31:45.320]  Chaff or whatever that...
[31:46.620 --> 31:46.940]  Like...
[31:46.940 --> 31:47.140]  Yeah.
[31:47.480 --> 31:48.740]  And then a bunch of tender.
[31:48.900 --> 31:50.760]  And then you just like build it up.
[31:50.840 --> 31:53.900]  Oh, and then we have to get the string and make a little thing with the flag.
[31:54.060 --> 31:54.520]  We can do that.
[31:54.740 --> 31:59.420]  And then Gavin's got to go to a park that's on public land to get a bunch of twigs and branches.
[32:00.040 --> 32:00.960]  Did you say kindering?
[32:01.480 --> 32:02.260]  No, I said tendering.
[32:02.900 --> 32:03.220]  Tendering?
[32:03.860 --> 32:04.080]  Yeah.
[32:05.000 --> 32:05.640]  For fires.
[32:08.060 --> 32:08.940]  Kindling and tender?
[32:09.660 --> 32:10.680]  Well, yeah, when you go on...
[32:10.680 --> 32:13.340]  When you go on Tinder and you're trying to set it on fire,
[32:13.560 --> 32:16.940]  you're swiping so fast that you're trying to start the fire.
[32:17.380 --> 32:17.640]  OK.
[32:19.400 --> 32:20.700]  Tendering, is that not...
[32:20.700 --> 32:21.960]  Is that the phrase?
[32:22.640 --> 32:24.900]  Tender is like what you'd like to start the kindling, right?
[32:26.320 --> 32:28.620]  Tender is a word and kindling is a word.
[32:28.760 --> 32:30.280]  I don't know that tendering is a word.
[32:30.680 --> 32:34.500]  I like that you were saying tendering and I thought you were saying kindering.
[32:35.320 --> 32:38.540]  Which I think would be German for like childing.
[32:41.440 --> 32:43.300]  Are we sure about this?
[32:44.640 --> 32:45.900]  Sure about what?
[32:46.720 --> 32:48.360]  Tendering not being a thing?
[32:48.920 --> 32:50.520]  Well, tendering is how I met Emily.
[32:54.660 --> 32:55.860]  I'm going to install...
[32:55.860 --> 32:59.960]  I've been playing The Long Dark recently, which is a survival game and where you got to
[32:59.960 --> 33:02.480]  collect stuff or you make fires and that type of thing.
[33:02.480 --> 33:05.820]  I could have swore I probably combined the two words like you're saying.
[33:05.920 --> 33:06.760]  That's almost guaranteed.
[33:07.260 --> 33:11.160]  But I'm redownloading it just to check if that's a word in that.
[33:11.300 --> 33:14.620]  So you're just back on that console splitting that attention.
[33:15.220 --> 33:18.000]  Well, I just I queued up to download The Long Dark.
[33:18.100 --> 33:21.980]  In his defense, if I if my computer worked, I'd be playing Prop Hunt right now.
[33:23.940 --> 33:26.480]  Does everyone do other shit while they're making the podcast?
[33:26.480 --> 33:28.920]  No, no, absolutely not.
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.460]  I'm logged in doing this podcast.
[33:30.860 --> 33:33.660]  All I do is... I'll be honest with you, dude.
[33:33.740 --> 33:35.620]  I don't even have my eyes open for most of the podcast.
[33:35.820 --> 33:38.780]  I sit here in front of the mic with my eyes closed and look forward.
[33:39.280 --> 33:41.560]  I just realized right now my eyes are dead ass closed.
[33:42.540 --> 33:45.700]  Every once in a while, I open to look at the waveform and make sure it's still there
[33:45.700 --> 33:46.940]  or see if anybody posted.
[33:47.100 --> 33:48.500]  And then I'm back to closed eyes.
[33:49.020 --> 33:50.600]  That's why I got eaten by that cougar in GTA.
[33:50.720 --> 33:51.440]  My eyes were closed.
[33:52.280 --> 33:52.960]  I was so focused.
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.380]  This episode, this is a three out of ten.
[33:55.400 --> 33:56.620]  This might be a two out of ten, guys.
[33:56.800 --> 33:58.780]  This is a... We got to lock in here.
[33:58.860 --> 34:00.500]  We got to we got to pull this one out of the dumpster.
[34:00.500 --> 34:01.960]  We got to get it.
[34:02.020 --> 34:04.980]  It might be catching on fire with all the tindling or whatever.
[34:05.200 --> 34:05.980]  This is not good.
[34:07.100 --> 34:11.660]  So as of the day this comes out, it's 2025.
[34:12.400 --> 34:12.880]  Correct.
[34:13.780 --> 34:16.420]  And who's who's watching Q1?
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.060]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[34:20.240 --> 34:27.340]  I can I can be on lookout in Q1 if that's what we need.
[34:27.920 --> 34:31.280]  I'll take I can I don't mind taking the first watch if that's the case.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.580]  I'm I'm terrified because I don't want to repeat what I did with Gavin earlier.
[34:35.860 --> 34:40.920]  But I keep meaning to bring up I had an idea for the Nick mask game.
[34:41.140 --> 34:44.760]  And I'm now I'm so nervous that we've already been over this
[34:44.760 --> 34:46.780]  and that we're all talking about the same thing.
[34:47.000 --> 34:48.020]  What? OK, what is it?
[34:48.780 --> 34:52.600]  Instead of doing because we have always done where we swap out
[34:52.600 --> 34:54.460]  and Nick only has to wear the mask once.
[34:54.460 --> 34:58.240]  What if Nick has to try to wear the mask four different times
[34:58.240 --> 35:00.740]  and we're each on different like sets of months?
[35:01.220 --> 35:03.900]  He has to wear the mask four in four course.
[35:04.320 --> 35:06.880]  Yes. So let's say Eric starts.
[35:07.040 --> 35:10.940]  He is the first three months of the year. Nick has three months to do it.
[35:11.420 --> 35:11.840]  Shit.
[35:12.180 --> 35:16.280]  And instead of Nick just passing through once and theoretically,
[35:16.280 --> 35:18.480]  one of us never even needing to be on guard.
[35:19.060 --> 35:21.320]  That's but but that's what I like about it.
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.620]  Yeah, I mean, that's like that's only 12 episodes to cover.
[35:25.760 --> 35:32.240]  That's I mean, to me, the excitement is I'm going to be on guard until March 31st
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.340]  and then my watch is over and it's somebody else's problem now.
[35:36.380 --> 35:38.460]  And there's so much writing on it.
[35:38.540 --> 35:40.700]  Well, we should clarify your watch isn't over.
[35:40.900 --> 35:41.920]  It's just you're heightened.
[35:42.440 --> 35:43.500]  Everyone's on watch.
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.240]  OK, OK.
[35:45.760 --> 35:46.400]  Speak for yourself.
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.100]  Yeah, Geoff's eyes are closed.
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.000]  Andrew's playing Grand Theft Auto.
[35:51.580 --> 35:51.840]  All right.
[35:52.080 --> 35:53.600]  Maybe someone watching harder than others.
[35:54.480 --> 35:54.920]  I don't know.
[35:54.960 --> 35:58.540]  I like the idea of it being a one time event in an entire year.
[35:58.900 --> 35:59.560]  Me too. That's fine.
[35:59.720 --> 36:00.780]  I do. I do like that.
[36:01.060 --> 36:03.480]  I was just trying to balance it out a little bit because we're like oh and three.
[36:04.200 --> 36:09.340]  It would just be insane that it's like so early on that he would do it because then
[36:09.340 --> 36:10.740]  the rest of the year, the thing's blown.
[36:10.920 --> 36:12.580]  But at the same time, what a move.
[36:12.980 --> 36:15.140]  Yeah, I think it would have been a smart move to do it today.
[36:15.140 --> 36:15.620]  Yeah.
[36:19.060 --> 36:22.040]  That being said, I bet I could have snuck it past you every quarter.
[36:22.320 --> 36:23.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[36:23.140 --> 36:26.860]  I mean, if you're confident enough to do it, you could you could increase it.
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.980]  I mean, if if if it's the case where we're trying to call it out and you want to see
[36:31.980 --> 36:34.660]  how many times you can wear it, that's up to you.
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.620]  You know what I mean?
[36:35.620 --> 36:38.440]  Like we only have one call out each, right?
[36:38.740 --> 36:41.400]  So yeah, and that gives you the ability, Nick.
[36:41.420 --> 36:43.280]  I mean, you can wear it every week.
[36:43.940 --> 36:44.440]  Potentially.
[36:44.740 --> 36:50.160]  If Nick gets it by us, he can choose to do double or double.
[36:51.460 --> 36:52.900]  Double or double what?
[36:53.320 --> 36:56.020]  He has to wear two masks at the same time.
[36:56.420 --> 36:57.760]  What the fuck?
[36:58.440 --> 36:59.560]  What the fuck?
[36:59.560 --> 37:00.900]  You're just putting on more masks?
[37:00.900 --> 37:02.500]  Open your eyes and do something.
[37:02.880 --> 37:03.780]  What's going on?
[37:03.960 --> 37:07.940]  If he wants to do the double or double, he could maybe put on the Andrew Balaclava
[37:07.940 --> 37:09.640]  and the monkey mask.
[37:10.660 --> 37:12.880]  And see if he gets that one by us.
[37:12.880 --> 37:14.320]  And if he does, he gets double.
[37:15.700 --> 37:19.640]  It's like that scene in Mission Impossible where he just keeps taking off fake faces.
[37:24.420 --> 37:25.760]  Well, is there a price?
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.000]  Like, just did you?
[37:27.600 --> 37:28.060]  All right, Nick.
[37:28.160 --> 37:31.260]  OK, so Nick, Nick was so fast to say yes.
[37:31.320 --> 37:31.820]  Sorry, sorry.
[37:31.820 --> 37:33.100]  I was saying, yeah, there should be.
[37:33.160 --> 37:33.660]  There should be.
[37:33.740 --> 37:35.160]  OK, so that's what's my price.
[37:35.460 --> 37:36.920]  OK, so that's UK.
[37:37.940 --> 37:38.340]  OK.
[37:39.640 --> 37:40.720]  Was there a price?
[37:40.840 --> 37:42.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:42.240 --> 37:44.640]  What if it's just a hundred dollar gift card?
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.760]  And if he loses, he has to give us all a hundred dollar gift card.
[37:49.860 --> 37:52.960]  What if it's a hundred dollar gift?
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.240]  If you lose, there's no penalty.
[37:54.740 --> 37:57.100]  But if you win, it's a hundred dollar gift card.
[37:57.200 --> 37:58.440]  But we get to pick to wear.
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.640]  Oh, I love that.
[38:00.780 --> 38:01.780]  Now, now this is...
[38:02.200 --> 38:03.700]  Hello, tractor supply.
[38:06.520 --> 38:08.280]  I do need some lawn feed.
[38:08.360 --> 38:10.380]  Yeah, you're gonna get a hundred dollars worth, buddy.
[38:10.560 --> 38:11.180]  Oh, yeah.
[38:11.180 --> 38:14.020]  And at that point, if you win a hundred dollars, you can choose to do the double.
[38:15.340 --> 38:18.800]  You can, you can bet your hundred dollars on the double.
[38:20.760 --> 38:21.880]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[38:22.200 --> 38:23.300]  I like, that's a good idea.
[38:23.780 --> 38:27.920]  I still, I like, I really do like the idea of us giving away gift certificates to each
[38:27.920 --> 38:29.940]  other, but we don't, but we pick where they go.
[38:31.740 --> 38:35.160]  All right, so that's the 2025 game.
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.120]  Nick once again has to sneak a whole episode of Wearing the Mask past us.
[38:39.120 --> 38:43.560]  And if he wants to go for the double, he can put the balaclava on under the mask and
[38:43.560 --> 38:43.940]  go again.
[38:44.680 --> 38:45.320]  All right.
[38:45.800 --> 38:46.120]  Interesting.
[38:46.340 --> 38:48.320]  Now, does he have to reveal between the two?
[38:48.900 --> 38:50.120]  Or can he just go back to back?
[38:51.120 --> 38:52.860]  I think, yeah, I think he would have to reveal.
[38:53.220 --> 38:55.300]  Yeah, he would, he would have to reveal if he wore the mask.
[38:55.420 --> 38:55.580]  Yes.
[38:55.700 --> 38:58.080]  Yeah, usually he pops on at the end of the episode with the camera.
[38:58.860 --> 38:59.720]  Yeah, that's true.
[39:00.060 --> 39:00.780]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[39:01.260 --> 39:02.700]  Okay, so Eric's Q1.
[39:03.480 --> 39:04.280]  I like spring.
[39:04.380 --> 39:05.460]  I could go, I could go Q2.
[39:05.980 --> 39:06.860]  I'll do Q3.
[39:06.860 --> 39:08.240]  I'll do Q4.
[39:08.340 --> 39:09.920]  Andrew's heightened in Q4.
[39:10.060 --> 39:10.640]  I like it.
[39:10.720 --> 39:11.080]  All right.
[39:11.400 --> 39:13.720]  Okay, I'm locked in, I guess, for this monkey mask.
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.100]  So I'm taking 1st of April to the 30th of June.
[39:19.900 --> 39:20.740]  I'm excited.
[39:21.280 --> 39:21.940]  Good months.
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.040]  Oh, great months.
[39:23.540 --> 39:24.560]  I love quarter four.
[39:24.800 --> 39:25.640]  Big quarter four fan.
[39:25.960 --> 39:29.360]  When you said 1st of April, it sounded like you said Vapril.
[39:29.540 --> 39:34.240]  And I thought for a second that that was a thing, like no, like no mustache November or whatever.
[39:34.480 --> 39:35.300]  It's like Vapril.
[39:35.300 --> 39:38.660]  Fucking everybody gets together and just vapes hard all April.
[39:40.160 --> 39:41.880]  Dude, that's awesome.
[39:42.060 --> 39:45.020]  Me, you, Chad, James, we're just going to keep vaping.
[39:46.760 --> 39:48.440]  Stephen Suptic shows up.
[39:48.540 --> 39:49.240]  He's like, remember me?
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.180]  That's funny.
[39:56.820 --> 40:00.680]  Remember me is the funniest thing you can say.
[40:00.980 --> 40:01.560]  That's great.
[40:04.600 --> 40:05.900]  Could an ass vape?
[40:07.560 --> 40:07.920]  Yes.
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.040]  Yeah, right.
[40:09.560 --> 40:12.380]  I'm sure Will the farter could vape through his ass.
[40:14.160 --> 40:16.160]  I wonder if you could fart smoke rings.
[40:16.640 --> 40:18.120]  How does a smoke ring work?
[40:18.360 --> 40:19.320]  I don't really know.
[40:19.500 --> 40:20.360]  That's why I asked.
[40:20.780 --> 40:24.500]  I think you like blow it and then you like, I think it has something to do with your tongue.
[40:25.040 --> 40:28.500]  You like blow air through the blow, like blow around you.
[40:28.540 --> 40:28.860]  I don't know.
[40:28.900 --> 40:29.580]  I've never been able to do it.
[40:29.600 --> 40:30.720]  I'm not a smoker, though, so I don't know.
[40:30.720 --> 40:33.740]  It'd be make it even extra hard because there's never smoke in my lungs.
[40:33.820 --> 40:36.120]  Yeah, you're just you're a bottle cap flinging guy.
[40:36.360 --> 40:37.120]  That's your thing.
[40:37.420 --> 40:37.560]  It is.
[40:37.820 --> 40:39.040]  I am a bottle cap snapper.
[40:39.300 --> 40:39.480]  Yep.
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.040]  You still snapping caps?
[40:41.560 --> 40:44.880]  I did the other day with Eric and Nick just to see if I could still do it.
[40:45.060 --> 40:47.000]  It was like a four out of 10 snap.
[40:47.440 --> 40:48.060]  Oh, no.
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.720]  I did tell him at the time, though, I snapped one so hard in my kitchen that it bounced off
[40:51.720 --> 40:55.580]  the countertop and went back and hit me in the forehead and stuck into my forehead in
[40:55.580 --> 40:56.060]  front of Gavin.
[40:57.020 --> 40:58.840]  That was maybe one of the best days of my life.
[41:01.360 --> 41:04.580]  If you're going to rank like the top 10 best days of your life,
[41:04.640 --> 41:08.680]  how many of them are Geoff getting hurt due to his own move?
[41:09.760 --> 41:13.800]  Oh, that was such a good one at work that I wasn't even there for.
[41:13.900 --> 41:18.300]  I just watched the video of and I still still think about it and laugh.
[41:18.640 --> 41:19.240]  What was it?
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.200]  It was when they they had that giant inflatable ball and you...
[41:25.900 --> 41:29.360]  I don't know if you climbed on it or tried to jump onto the top of it,
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.420]  but you ended up falling over backwards and doing like a backflip off it.
[41:34.920 --> 41:36.640]  And no one ever uploaded it.
[41:38.200 --> 41:38.640]  Really?
[41:38.920 --> 41:40.000]  Never. Never came out.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.640]  I remember getting real fucking hard on that ball one day.
[41:43.380 --> 41:47.600]  There was something that came out with that ball, but then there was a bigger ball
[41:48.200 --> 41:50.860]  and it looked like you broke your neck.
[41:51.060 --> 41:53.440]  Yeah, I remember I landed on my neck. I remember.
[41:56.860 --> 42:02.420]  Let me know if someone in the audience has actually seen that and it just maybe snuck past me.
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.440]  If you have, please link it.
[42:04.600 --> 42:05.220]  I would like to see.
[42:05.400 --> 42:06.780]  Gavin would like to see me hurt again.
[42:07.320 --> 42:12.700]  It's like I would say maybe a six foot height, like the ball was taller than some people
[42:12.700 --> 42:19.920]  and Geoff was on top and then he falls backwards and just gets flung like a ragdoll onto his head.
[42:21.820 --> 42:23.040]  Ah, the good old days.
[42:23.440 --> 42:24.020]  The good old days.
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.640]  Ever since we talked about the theory that we get enjoyment from seeing people get hurt or fall
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.520]  because it means they're getting eaten by the cougar, it has changed my viewing habits
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.760]  so much or just how I view. I'm just constantly happy about feeling safe. It's great.
[42:42.680 --> 42:45.760]  It's embedded in your fucking genetics, dude.
[42:46.300 --> 42:50.700]  It's just every time, like before, just ah, that guy got hit in the nuts and now it's ah,
[42:50.700 --> 42:52.020]  that guy just got eaten by a cougar.
[42:52.020 --> 42:54.900]  He got, he got fucking velociraptored and I lived.
[42:57.040 --> 43:02.660]  It, cause there was a, I was, I was scrolling and I got a montage of people
[43:02.660 --> 43:05.880]  getting fucked up on Wipeout and I was like, this is the ultimate safety show.
[43:07.160 --> 43:08.420]  Never felt safer.
[43:08.840 --> 43:15.980]  Wipeout with Jon Henson, that one might be some of the best television in the history of TV
[43:15.980 --> 43:20.460]  if you like to see people get hit hard when they're not expecting it.
[43:20.460 --> 43:26.880]  It was like every episode was like a fucking title fight. It was so good.
[43:27.440 --> 43:29.620]  So good for so long. I, man.
[43:30.240 --> 43:31.120]  I would go on that.
[43:31.880 --> 43:33.120]  You have people die on that show.
[43:34.500 --> 43:34.860]  Jesus.
[43:35.820 --> 43:36.080]  Yeah.
[43:36.400 --> 43:38.000]  Yeah, they just don't air those episodes.
[43:38.420 --> 43:39.260]  I would hope not.
[43:39.380 --> 43:40.300]  Same with Fear Factor.
[43:40.720 --> 43:42.840]  There's a bunch of times people got really fucked up on Fear Factor and they're like,
[43:42.900 --> 43:45.400]  well, sorry to everybody else on this episode, nobody will ever see it.
[43:45.860 --> 43:48.880]  By the way, isn't Fear Factor like the producers doing shit to people?
[43:49.440 --> 43:52.220]  Yeah, but they have to do like to prove a fear as a factor.
[43:52.340 --> 43:54.920]  Sometimes it was like Joe Rogan makes you eat a whale's penis,
[43:55.100 --> 43:58.900]  but other times it was like you have to jump from this rooftop to another rooftop.
[43:59.180 --> 44:04.000]  I mean, you almost ran me over with one of those hand pump train cart things.
[44:05.180 --> 44:08.240]  I wasn't going to actually run you over. We had a safety string.
[44:08.880 --> 44:09.940]  What happened to it?
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.360]  It broke.
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.800]  We rolled over and we didn't even know.
[44:14.540 --> 44:17.440]  They put like a chain or something over the track so it would stop.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.100]  And they just went straight over it.
[44:25.600 --> 44:28.920]  There's a, you know, Tom Cruise broke his foot in that roof jump
[44:30.020 --> 44:31.960]  in that One Wish Impossible movie.
[44:32.540 --> 44:32.660]  Yeah.
[44:32.980 --> 44:37.020]  It made me, when I watched that movie, you view it after that happened,
[44:37.060 --> 44:39.160]  you view that scene within the context of what happened.
[44:39.620 --> 44:44.120]  And it made me think about, is that the most amount of time between shots
[44:44.680 --> 44:48.140]  were like he jumps and lands on the roof and then he takes like
[44:48.140 --> 44:50.760]  they cut and he runs like four more steps.
[44:51.160 --> 44:54.340]  And I was thinking it's probably what, like eight months, I'd assume,
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.680]  between him landing on the roof and him moving four feet on the roof.
[44:58.960 --> 45:01.040]  Oh, yeah, probably three or four months at least.
[45:01.220 --> 45:04.320]  I mean, didn't Eraserhead take like several years to shoot?
[45:04.760 --> 45:05.140]  Did it?
[45:05.540 --> 45:08.960]  OK, so Eraserhead was filmed. I'm glad you asked.
[45:08.960 --> 45:15.460]  Eraserhead was filmed in an old like horse ranch stables
[45:15.460 --> 45:18.380]  that were owned by the American Film Institute.
[45:18.640 --> 45:24.800]  They I think they gave David Lynch and those guys the the use of it at night.
[45:24.880 --> 45:28.000]  And so they filmed one scene.
[45:28.240 --> 45:29.760]  This is how David Lynch works or worked back then.
[45:30.080 --> 45:31.760]  He filmed one scene a night.
[45:31.840 --> 45:34.220]  And I think it took them four years to film Eraserhead.
[45:34.520 --> 45:35.740]  Oh, oh, wow.
[45:35.800 --> 45:38.540]  OK, but they consistently filmed like I mean,
[45:38.540 --> 45:40.740]  I assume every night that they could.
[45:40.880 --> 45:42.200]  I don't know that they filmed seven days a week.
[45:42.280 --> 45:45.260]  But yeah, they they shot that thing at night over four years.
[45:45.400 --> 45:48.080]  It took very, very long because he's you know,
[45:48.100 --> 45:52.260]  David Lynch is such an auteur to the extreme that he builds the furniture.
[45:52.500 --> 45:55.700]  Like if you watch Lost Highway, he built all the furniture in their house
[45:55.700 --> 45:58.640]  because he couldn't find a house that looked right.
[45:58.920 --> 46:01.600]  So he like he's like that precise with stuff.
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.640]  That's wild.
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.540]  So funny you the David Lynch came up because I just he's my my New Year's resolution
[46:07.540 --> 46:08.580]  for twenty twenty five.
[46:09.120 --> 46:11.380]  I decided to watch all of his films.
[46:11.900 --> 46:16.340]  No, I was somebody asked me on Solowrite in an email if I what order they should watch
[46:16.340 --> 46:17.000]  Twin Peaks in.
[46:17.200 --> 46:21.000]  And so I was explaining it and then I realized I never finished the new Twin Peaks series
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.620]  because we were watching it.
[46:23.740 --> 46:30.020]  And then then I got divorced and and I just never went back to it.
[46:30.040 --> 46:31.640]  You know, it's like I just never thought about it again.
[46:31.700 --> 46:33.680]  And I realized I never finished it.
[46:33.700 --> 46:34.720]  So I got to go back and watch it.
[46:34.740 --> 46:36.360]  And I feel I feel like a bad David Lynch fan.
[46:36.360 --> 46:37.460]  So that's my New Year's resolution.
[46:37.600 --> 46:40.720]  I'm going to I'm going to rewatch the new two seasons of Twin Peaks.
[46:41.060 --> 46:44.880]  I feel like I the last episode I watched was Dougie and the Casino.
[46:45.300 --> 46:46.020]  I think so.
[46:46.140 --> 46:47.560]  Yeah, that'd been my last episode to probably.
[46:48.160 --> 46:50.080]  I didn't know they did two seasons when they brought it back.
[46:50.140 --> 46:50.880]  I thought it was just one.
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.300]  I don't know that it was two seasons, but it was split.
[46:53.420 --> 46:55.220]  So there were like nine and nine or something.
[46:56.720 --> 46:59.060]  I think that was a comeback for Matthew Willard.
[46:59.720 --> 47:00.940]  I think he was in that, wasn't he?
[47:01.060 --> 47:03.140]  He's a fucking dork in it.
[47:03.960 --> 47:05.100]  He's a dork in most things.
[47:05.100 --> 47:05.640]  That's true.
[47:06.240 --> 47:07.720]  Yeah, that's sort of what he does.
[47:08.060 --> 47:08.880]  Except for Scream.
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.900]  You don't think he's a dork in Scream?
[47:12.260 --> 47:14.300]  I think he's a massive dork in Scream.
[47:14.720 --> 47:16.140]  Come on, guys, you're making fun of Nick's hero.
[47:17.660 --> 47:19.880]  Is it his name like Stew or something?
[47:20.080 --> 47:22.280]  And he just goes like, I'll be right back.
[47:22.640 --> 47:24.620]  It's like, OK, yeah, that's a dork.
[47:26.740 --> 47:27.720]  He's very much a dork.
[47:28.900 --> 47:30.740]  What's your favorite Matthew Willard movie, Nick?
[47:32.780 --> 47:33.580]  Probably Scream.
[47:34.020 --> 47:34.540]  Scream, OK.
[47:34.540 --> 47:35.620]  Name another one.
[47:35.940 --> 47:36.780]  SLC Punk, right?
[47:37.220 --> 47:38.400]  Yeah, it's a great movie.
[47:38.840 --> 47:39.060]  Yeah.
[47:39.400 --> 47:40.140]  Oh, I never saw it.
[47:40.480 --> 47:40.980]  Without a paddle?
[47:42.840 --> 47:43.460]  Scooby-Doo.
[47:44.160 --> 47:44.880]  Scooby-Doo 2.
[47:45.040 --> 47:45.340]  Scooby-Doo 2?
[47:45.540 --> 47:45.860]  Yeah.
[47:48.680 --> 47:50.080]  What were you going to say, Geoff?
[47:50.260 --> 47:52.080]  You know, Matt Holum worked on that movie.
[47:52.980 --> 47:53.260]  What?
[47:53.540 --> 47:54.280]  Scooby-Doo 2.
[47:54.660 --> 47:58.820]  He did Scrappyzilla Wrecks or whatever it was.
[47:59.220 --> 48:00.440]  He worked on that.
[48:00.800 --> 48:01.860]  I hate Scrappy-Doo.
[48:02.540 --> 48:03.800]  Well, fucking blame Matt.
[48:06.400 --> 48:08.640]  Have you ever looked at the Snoopy?
[48:08.700 --> 48:10.040]  I was going to say Snoopy.
[48:10.220 --> 48:12.540]  God, because I've just been so in Snoopy mode with Eric.
[48:12.800 --> 48:14.540]  The Scooby-Doo family tree.
[48:15.360 --> 48:16.220]  It's vast.
[48:16.580 --> 48:17.700]  He's got quite the family tree.
[48:18.260 --> 48:18.480]  Really?
[48:19.140 --> 48:20.000]  Oh, it's huge.
[48:20.100 --> 48:21.660]  Yeah, I mean, I guess I'll have to find a photo.
[48:21.820 --> 48:24.140]  It's the number of Scooby-Doo's.
[48:25.420 --> 48:26.380]  There we go.
[48:26.900 --> 48:28.960]  Wait, like I wasn't already grabbing it.
[48:29.160 --> 48:31.200]  I'm a big fan of Doobie Doobie Doo.
[48:31.600 --> 48:32.820]  Yankee Doodle Doo.
[48:32.820 --> 48:35.500]  It all starts with Missing Link Doo.
[48:36.880 --> 48:38.660]  Then Yankee Doodle Doo.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.800]  Then Great Grandpa Scooby, who looks like a ghost.
[48:42.640 --> 48:45.260]  Then Grandpa Scooby, who looks like a younger ghost.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.100]  Then Dada Doo and Horton Doo.
[48:48.160 --> 48:49.180]  Jesus Christ.
[48:49.560 --> 48:50.560]  Yeah, listen, it's vast.
[48:50.660 --> 48:51.820]  There's a lot of Scooby-Doo lore.
[48:52.240 --> 48:53.960]  This looks like a list of...
[48:53.960 --> 48:54.200]  Mumsy Doo?
[48:54.840 --> 48:57.760]  It looks like a list of Achievement Hunter split between the games videos.
[49:00.640 --> 49:02.720]  Like Flinchy Moony Doo is in there.
[49:03.700 --> 49:05.060]  There's a Yabba Doo.
[49:05.320 --> 49:06.500]  You gotta be kidding me.
[49:06.600 --> 49:08.400]  Scooby-Doo's got a brother named Yabba Doo.
[49:09.120 --> 49:10.660]  That's a Fred Flintstone.
[49:11.300 --> 49:12.000]  Howdy Doo.
[49:12.640 --> 49:13.520]  Skippy Doo.
[49:14.180 --> 49:15.180]  Doobie Doobie Doo.
[49:16.340 --> 49:17.720]  Doobie Doobie Doo is great.
[49:18.220 --> 49:19.160]  Whoopsie Doo.
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.400]  Whoopsie Doo.
[49:20.920 --> 49:26.240]  Was Great Grandpa Scooby in the confederacy?
[49:26.800 --> 49:29.660]  It definitely looks like it with that hat.
[49:30.180 --> 49:30.620]  Yeah.
[49:31.420 --> 49:33.420]  Is Scooby a plantation pup?
[49:34.180 --> 49:35.380]  He also looks like...
[49:35.380 --> 49:36.100]  I gotta be honest with you.
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.680]  Great Grandpa, he looks like he's looking in this family tree.
[49:38.960 --> 49:42.680]  He looks concerned and he's looking straight down at Doobie Doobie Doo.
[49:43.980 --> 49:46.960]  I don't know about you, Great Grandpa Scooby.
[49:47.160 --> 49:48.980]  I don't know about this one, man.
[49:49.200 --> 49:50.120]  I don't know, man.
[49:50.200 --> 49:51.120]  Yeah, I don't know.
[49:51.160 --> 49:54.440]  On Scoobypedia, his occupation is listed as soldier.
[49:56.240 --> 49:59.500]  Yeah, but now are there pictures of him wearing blue
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.020]  or pictures of him wearing gray?
[50:01.120 --> 50:02.320]  That's the thing.
[50:02.520 --> 50:03.160]  Is he a ghost the whole time?
[50:03.440 --> 50:03.740]  Or...
[50:03.740 --> 50:06.920]  Was the father of Grandpa Scooby in a civil war hero?
[50:07.760 --> 50:09.000]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.300]  But hero is a loose term, depending on where you're at when you say it.
[50:14.040 --> 50:17.000]  Was Mumsy Doo named that from birth, do you think?
[50:17.540 --> 50:21.860]  Well, I don't think Dada Doo was probably named Dada Doo, I would think.
[50:21.980 --> 50:22.900]  I don't know, maybe not.
[50:23.460 --> 50:25.500]  Grandpa gave birth to Horton and Dada.
[50:28.220 --> 50:32.220]  Well, I mean, do you think Great-Grandpa gave birth to Grandpa?
[50:33.780 --> 50:36.160]  He was like, and you shall be Grandpa.
[50:38.760 --> 50:43.980]  And we're all related to Missing Link Doo, his Christian name.
[50:46.020 --> 50:47.140]  Missing Link Doo.
[50:47.820 --> 50:48.120]  Eric.
[50:48.700 --> 50:49.000]  Yes.
[50:50.300 --> 50:53.480]  What? How much to get the Missing Link Doo tattoo?
[50:54.080 --> 50:54.600]  Oh, yeah.
[50:54.600 --> 50:56.080]  I think I might get...
[50:56.540 --> 51:00.080]  I'd have to look at what the Missing Link Doo was from,
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.900]  because it looks like it may be from a pup named Scooby Doo.
[51:03.060 --> 51:04.000]  And I don't know about that.
[51:04.300 --> 51:05.320]  Pup named Scooby Doo is good.
[51:05.700 --> 51:10.000]  What if we all agreed to get a member of the Scooby Doo family
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.560]  that is not Scooby Doo tattooed in 2014?
[51:12.620 --> 51:15.740]  Oh, God, can it not be from the picture Andrew just sent?
[51:16.200 --> 51:17.600]  Yeah, we could.
[51:17.960 --> 51:20.260]  This deep ass looking...
[51:20.260 --> 51:21.240]  Oh, this sucks.
[51:22.600 --> 51:25.240]  If I get one, it's the one in the photo.
[51:26.560 --> 51:28.380]  He's fucking pissed.
[51:28.640 --> 51:30.040]  Which Scooby...
[51:30.040 --> 51:32.260]  All right, first off, I think we should all get one.
[51:32.340 --> 51:35.160]  And I know who I would get based on who I am and my history.
[51:35.340 --> 51:36.920]  Is it the clown hanging upside down?
[51:37.240 --> 51:40.360]  No, I would get fucking Hillbilly Yabba Doo, because I'm from Alabama.
[51:43.780 --> 51:46.120]  Who do you all most identify with?
[51:46.500 --> 51:49.280]  If you had to be somebody on the Scooby Doo family tree, who would you be?
[51:49.280 --> 51:51.320]  I guess the one in the top hat.
[51:52.100 --> 51:56.200]  I think I'm Yankee Doodle Doo,
[51:56.440 --> 51:59.820]  but only in the picture Andrew just sent where he's fucking mad.
[52:00.740 --> 52:02.880]  He's pissed. Why is he pissed?
[52:03.840 --> 52:04.740]  That's a good question.
[52:05.460 --> 52:06.160]  Seems much...
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.240]  I think Nick is Scrappy, though.
[52:08.380 --> 52:10.700]  I think I see that you said the other one.
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.480]  I don't know about that.
[52:11.480 --> 52:11.920]  Yeah, that's me.
[52:12.040 --> 52:12.300]  Nah.
[52:12.940 --> 52:14.460]  Nick thinks he's Howdy Doo.
[52:14.800 --> 52:16.000]  Yeah, you wish you were Howdy Doo.
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.580]  You're a Scrappy if I ever saw it.
[52:17.920 --> 52:18.620]  Ah, fuck Scrappy.
[52:19.440 --> 52:21.940]  How many nipples does a dog have?
[52:22.560 --> 52:24.140]  Okay, well, I'm going to mute myself again.
[52:25.860 --> 52:27.420]  Eight, I believe, right?
[52:28.260 --> 52:28.540]  Is it?
[52:29.060 --> 52:29.300]  Yeah.
[52:30.060 --> 52:30.580]  Yeah, isn't it?
[52:31.700 --> 52:33.580]  I mean, I don't have my dog in front of me or I'd count them.
[52:35.020 --> 52:35.640]  But why?
[52:36.320 --> 52:39.220]  Just because I got one cat who's always got a nipple out,
[52:39.420 --> 52:41.800]  and I feel like some of my cats have less nipples.
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.620]  When you say nipple out, what do you mean?
[52:47.720 --> 52:48.320]  I just...
[52:48.320 --> 52:49.820]  He's always sat with like...
[52:50.460 --> 52:53.480]  I guess his nipples are balder than some of the other cats,
[52:53.580 --> 52:54.760]  but he's always...
[52:54.760 --> 52:58.260]  And he's quite fat, so his nipples kind of just drag a little bit.
[52:58.820 --> 53:02.540]  Like he'll sit and a nipple will just be like on top of his foot.
[53:06.950 --> 53:08.010]  I might have to go and count them all.
[53:08.590 --> 53:11.050]  Well, you know, just for a pivot, you know,
[53:11.110 --> 53:13.110]  just to get away from whatever the fuck this is,
[53:13.170 --> 53:14.110]  the results are in.
[53:15.430 --> 53:16.450]  Oh, what are they?
[53:16.510 --> 53:17.210]  What is a pineapple?
[53:18.410 --> 53:19.010]  It's a donut.
[53:19.010 --> 53:20.730]  100% say donut.
[53:21.290 --> 53:21.650]  Wow.
[53:22.030 --> 53:24.810]  All right, let's make this 422 votes.
[53:24.990 --> 53:27.150]  All right, we'll make a pineapple donut tomorrow.
[53:27.490 --> 53:28.490]  Are you gonna get sprinkles?
[53:28.710 --> 53:29.690]  What are you gonna put on it?
[53:30.030 --> 53:30.850]  Well, I feel like...
[53:30.850 --> 53:32.970]  So we'll cut the rings.
[53:33.310 --> 53:33.490]  Sprinkles.
[53:35.430 --> 53:36.790]  Dunk it in Choccy, maybe.
[53:36.950 --> 53:37.890]  Maybe a little bit of powdered...
[53:38.710 --> 53:39.230]  Well, what are we...
[53:40.370 --> 53:41.610]  Should we all bring an ingredient?
[53:42.110 --> 53:45.310]  I mean, everybody's encouraged to bring whatever ingredients you have.
[53:45.410 --> 53:47.010]  Also, if you just want to send me ingredients,
[53:47.010 --> 53:49.470]  I'll go to the store tomorrow morning and buy all this shit.
[53:49.710 --> 53:50.690]  Here's what's on the list.
[53:50.850 --> 53:52.830]  Pineapple, potatoes, bagels.
[53:53.090 --> 53:54.490]  Does anybody have a bagel preference?
[53:54.590 --> 53:56.450]  Should I just get plain bagels?
[53:57.050 --> 53:59.810]  Just get a plain bagel, because it's not the star of the show.
[53:59.910 --> 54:01.830]  I think it's just the base for the thing.
[54:02.890 --> 54:05.610]  Dogs and string, melted chocolate,
[54:06.330 --> 54:08.750]  whatever version Gavin approves of, and then sprinkles.
[54:10.210 --> 54:11.050]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[54:11.150 --> 54:12.790]  I think that's probably good.
[54:13.010 --> 54:14.370]  I think that's good.
[54:14.770 --> 54:14.950]  Okay.
[54:14.950 --> 54:16.370]  I saw you...
[54:16.370 --> 54:19.730]  I saw on TikTok yesterday how to make red licorice.
[54:20.250 --> 54:21.150]  You can make it yourself.
[54:21.710 --> 54:22.010]  Really?
[54:22.110 --> 54:22.410]  How do you make it?
[54:22.790 --> 54:23.810]  It doesn't seem hard.
[54:23.890 --> 54:28.310]  You just boil a bunch of sugar and other stuff,
[54:28.750 --> 54:30.750]  and then put a little red food color in.
[54:30.950 --> 54:31.550]  Should we make that?
[54:31.650 --> 54:37.250]  I don't think we have any attachment to red licorice whatsoever to want to be able to do this.
[54:37.610 --> 54:38.870]  Yeah, there's no point to it.
[54:38.910 --> 54:40.690]  I just remembered that I saw it yesterday,
[54:40.950 --> 54:42.490]  and I thought it was crazy that you could do it at home.
[54:42.930 --> 54:44.310]  It seems like something more complicated than that.
[54:44.310 --> 54:46.950]  I mean, if you wanted it as a topping to the donut...
[54:47.530 --> 54:47.930]  Oh.
[54:48.670 --> 54:49.730]  Licorice on a donut?
[54:50.150 --> 54:52.370]  Let's figure out a way to crowbar it into a different bit.
[54:52.750 --> 54:53.050]  Okay.
[54:56.250 --> 55:00.470]  You can make enough licorice as a safety string for something against Gavin.
[55:00.990 --> 55:01.690]  Have a break again.
[55:02.270 --> 55:04.350]  Andrew, do you want to make a competing donut tomorrow?
[55:04.990 --> 55:06.790]  Am I going to make a competing donut with an apple?
[55:06.950 --> 55:07.210]  No.
[55:08.470 --> 55:08.910]  Pineapple?
[55:09.550 --> 55:09.970]  No.
[55:10.550 --> 55:12.330]  I'm excited to see you guys in the lab.
[55:12.330 --> 55:14.750]  I got some other lab work I'm working on.
[55:14.750 --> 55:17.090]  I think we got some good stuff.
[55:17.150 --> 55:21.570]  We got the food stuff, but we also have the agility competition tomorrow, I believe.
[55:21.970 --> 55:22.770]  Oh, shit.
[55:23.150 --> 55:24.230]  I'm nervous about it.
[55:24.470 --> 55:24.950]  I'm not.
[55:26.190 --> 55:27.710]  You're good, Nick. You don't need to be nervous.
[55:28.150 --> 55:29.010]  Okay, thank you.
[55:30.770 --> 55:35.890]  You going to try to coat the agility circle with the pineapple juice for slipperyness?
[55:36.150 --> 55:38.550]  Nah, it's a bit sticky, isn't it, pineapple?
[55:38.550 --> 55:42.430]  I feel like it dries sticky, but at the time it would be kind of slippery.
[55:42.890 --> 55:44.290]  One way to find out.
[55:44.430 --> 55:44.810]  That's okay.
[55:45.650 --> 55:47.310]  I'll get a couple gallons of pineapple juice.
[55:47.770 --> 55:48.430]  Hell yeah.
[55:48.970 --> 55:55.690]  Are we doing one where you guys are just going in normal style and then you do another run
[55:55.690 --> 55:58.750]  where you can do whatever kind of performance enhancement that you bring?
[55:59.210 --> 56:02.770]  A no-peds run and then an any-peds, all bets are off run.
[56:02.950 --> 56:04.630]  Yeah, is that the plan?
[56:05.870 --> 56:07.410]  Wait, where we can bring anything we want?
[56:08.110 --> 56:11.130]  I would think so. I don't know, Geoff, does that sound right?
[56:11.250 --> 56:14.810]  All right, let's fucking hammer this out because we talked about it in Slack,
[56:14.970 --> 56:17.290]  but I never got confirmation that this is how it was.
[56:17.930 --> 56:20.850]  This is how I understand it from what Gavin was saying last time.
[56:20.910 --> 56:23.510]  Let me know if I got this wrong, but I'd like us all to be on the same page before we film.
[56:23.950 --> 56:27.250]  We're going to stake that motherfucker into the ground.
[56:28.390 --> 56:30.410]  Gavin's going to go through left to right.
[56:30.570 --> 56:31.550]  We're going to mark the time.
[56:31.750 --> 56:33.070]  Then he's going to go through right to left.
[56:33.350 --> 56:35.610]  We're going to mark the time and then we're going to average that out.
[56:35.650 --> 56:36.770]  And that's going to be Gavin's time.
[56:36.770 --> 56:38.590]  Then we'll do the same thing with Nick.
[56:38.830 --> 56:40.730]  Whoever wins is the fucking champ.
[56:41.110 --> 56:41.990]  Congratulations, Nick.
[56:42.070 --> 56:43.930]  I'm very excited to see it tomorrow.
[56:44.110 --> 56:47.570]  And then after that, we'll have the All Peds competition.
[56:47.770 --> 56:50.850]  If Gavin wants to lube up and then run through it and whatever,
[56:51.150 --> 56:52.950]  then Nick can do whatever it is he wants to do.
[56:53.070 --> 56:58.670]  And then they can have another competition with as many steroids and pine tar as they want.
[57:00.170 --> 57:01.910]  That was my understanding as well.
[57:01.910 --> 57:04.890]  Is go through once, go through a second time, average score.
[57:04.890 --> 57:09.490]  And then the second one would be a PED filled competition.
[57:09.510 --> 57:14.070]  The thing is, I mean, we talked about it before, but if I lube the whole thing,
[57:14.170 --> 57:15.510]  then Nick also gets the lube.
[57:16.270 --> 57:17.610]  Yeah, that's why we're doing that second.
[57:17.890 --> 57:19.090]  Yes, yeah, that's yeah.
[57:19.390 --> 57:22.510]  So we can flip a coin to see who goes first and second. It's up to you.
[57:23.070 --> 57:25.550]  What if you lined a slip and slide up with it?
[57:26.570 --> 57:29.670]  You slide, you go for the slide with the momentum.
[57:30.890 --> 57:33.790]  You slide down the slip and slide and try to carry through
[57:33.790 --> 57:35.450]  the agility, whatever.
[57:35.910 --> 57:38.070]  You'd come out of that tube like a bullet from a gun.
[57:38.650 --> 57:39.030]  You do.
[57:39.170 --> 57:40.430]  Oh, it'd stop you.
[57:40.530 --> 57:41.010]  That'd be awesome.
[57:42.010 --> 57:44.070]  What if you slip and slide into the tube?
[57:45.010 --> 57:47.230]  Yeah, what if I line the tube with the slip and slide?
[57:47.610 --> 57:49.950]  Oh, I thought it was on the other end. I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood that.
[57:50.870 --> 57:51.990]  What am I, Andrew here?
[57:52.210 --> 57:53.410]  Yeah, dude, no kidding.
[57:53.550 --> 57:56.610]  I heard what you said. I just inverted it in my brain.
[57:56.990 --> 57:57.810]  Are you playing GTA?
[57:58.550 --> 58:00.510]  No, my eyes are even closed. How can I do this?
[58:03.230 --> 58:05.710]  I think Nick will win. Standing by it.
[58:06.230 --> 58:06.690]  Sorry, guys.
[58:08.090 --> 58:09.530]  Was that four votes for Nick?
[58:10.210 --> 58:10.970]  I think we're all... yeah.
[58:10.970 --> 58:12.430]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
[58:13.190 --> 58:13.450]  Huh.
[58:13.670 --> 58:15.310]  I mean, I'm excited to see you compete.
[58:15.910 --> 58:17.570]  Oh, I'm definitely excited to see Gavin compete.
[58:17.850 --> 58:21.210]  Hey, Gav, everybody loves an underdog story.
[58:21.570 --> 58:22.150]  So it's true.
[58:22.310 --> 58:24.070]  This is a great opportunity for you.
[58:24.470 --> 58:25.850]  Prove the world wrong.
[58:28.470 --> 58:29.790]  I know Cinderella's here.
[58:30.510 --> 58:31.110]  Do we have to record?
[58:32.370 --> 58:33.270]  No Cinderella's here.
[58:34.790 --> 58:35.670]  I got news for you.
[58:35.790 --> 58:37.550]  Cinderella was just a story.
[58:40.450 --> 58:43.110]  We're going to put this in the fiction section.
[58:45.850 --> 58:46.530]  Was it Nick?
[58:46.710 --> 58:49.530]  Nick, were you trying to put in a no shoes rule as well?
[58:49.990 --> 58:50.830]  No, that's fine.
[58:50.930 --> 58:51.370]  What was that, Eric?
[58:51.870 --> 58:53.950]  I just think I was worried that it would tear.
[58:54.070 --> 58:57.850]  And then you guys are like, no, it's this special non-tearing fabric.
[58:57.990 --> 58:59.950]  And I just said, OK, I mean, if that's what you said.
[58:59.950 --> 59:01.970]  I think that was Meg that said it wouldn't tear.
[59:05.030 --> 59:06.810]  I have no idea if it'll tear or not.
[59:07.070 --> 59:10.290]  She seemed very confident, but Meg knows a lot about fabric.
[59:10.790 --> 59:12.410]  So if we're going to trust anybody, it should probably be true.
[59:12.750 --> 59:15.490]  Yeah, but if it's for dogs, they have they have long nails sometimes.
[59:15.870 --> 59:18.010]  So that's a good that's a good point.
[59:18.110 --> 59:19.170]  Albert's got little talons.
[59:19.470 --> 59:19.690]  Yeah.
[59:19.990 --> 59:20.290]  Yeah.
[59:20.790 --> 59:22.730]  We should also see if Albert could beat us.
[59:23.230 --> 59:24.570]  We should definitely do that.
[59:24.610 --> 59:25.630]  That's a great idea.
[59:25.810 --> 59:26.610]  I got no problem with that.
[59:27.010 --> 59:27.170]  Yeah.
[59:27.530 --> 59:29.690]  Now, is Albert going in lubed or non-lubed?
[59:29.690 --> 59:34.570]  I would prefer Albert to go in non-PED, so I don't have to give him a bath later.
[59:35.870 --> 59:39.150]  I assume it's easier to give Albert a bath than it will be for me to give Gavin a bath.
[59:39.210 --> 59:39.810]  I've done that before.
[59:41.970 --> 59:43.310]  Well, you did use dog shampoo.
[59:43.710 --> 59:45.650]  That was like the fifth best day of Gavin's life.
[59:45.710 --> 59:46.070]  Is that right?
[59:46.390 --> 59:48.430]  Yeah, I slipped.
[59:48.530 --> 59:49.390]  So it was extra funny.
[59:51.010 --> 59:52.150]  What did you hit your head on that time?
[59:53.110 --> 59:53.910]  The towel run.
[59:55.110 --> 59:55.430]  Obviously.
[59:56.070 --> 59:57.130]  Came out of the wall.
[59:57.230 --> 59:57.830]  It was the whole thing.
[59:57.830 --> 59:59.930]  We got to record another one of these.
[01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:02.510]  So next episode, people won't have an update, but...
[01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:05.050]  Yeah, I was just about to say we should wrap this up.
[01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:08.870]  Yeah, what are you jumping into right before we start recording this next one?
[01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:09.110]  My TV is off.
[01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:09.870]  They don't pay attention to.
[01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.770]  It's off.
[01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:11.970]  The monitor's off.
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.830]  I was checking something in GTA, as I said, for work.
[01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:17.370]  And then I got kind of caught in the snowy mountains.
[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:18.130]  It's nice.
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.250]  We should wrap this up and start the next one.
[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.150]  Well, there you go.
[01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.250]  Andrew said we should wrap it up.
[01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:28.110]  So that's what we're going to fucking do.
[01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:32.250]  Because I listen to Andrew and I pay attention to the things that he says.
[01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.510]  And when he speaks, I say, yes, sir, Andrew, sir.
[01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:37.530]  We'll end the episode right now, Andrew, sir.
[01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.990]  This is 2025 year.
[01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:40.510]  What? This is 2025.
[01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:43.630]  Nick, go ahead and fix that in 3, 2, 1.
[01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.770]  This is 2025, the year of Andrew Panton.
[01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:48.450]  We'll see you next time.
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.990]  Bye bye.
[01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.590]  Bye.
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:52.970]  Thank God, because this being a dragon year, that was not my year.
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:53.830]  I had to lay low.
