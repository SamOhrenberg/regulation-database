[00:00.000 --> 00:04.660]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast. That part's not funny,
[00:04.760 --> 00:08.680]  everything that comes after it will be though. This is episode 35. My name is Geoff Ramsey,
[00:08.720 --> 00:12.080]  with me as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour.
[00:12.720 --> 00:14.420]  Okay, Gavin, you be funny, now go.
[00:14.780 --> 00:18.680]  Oh, I was just blown away that Andrew can use the phrase, of course.
[00:19.720 --> 00:20.760]  Yeah, of course.
[00:21.160 --> 00:21.720]  Of course.
[00:22.140 --> 00:23.900]  Because nothing's of course with you, ever.
[00:24.200 --> 00:24.820]  What do you mean?
[00:26.940 --> 00:29.440]  Nothing's as it seems. There's no of course.
[00:29.440 --> 00:31.880]  That is the exterior perspective.
[00:33.700 --> 00:34.560]  Of what?
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.900]  What's the interior and what's the interior perspective?
[00:39.660 --> 00:44.280]  To me, it makes sense. It's of course. To the people around on the outside,
[00:44.480 --> 00:47.480]  it doesn't make sense. But I live in a world of course.
[00:48.160 --> 00:48.440]  But everyone...
[00:52.140 --> 00:57.100]  So I'm saying, is me saying of course, it makes sense to me.
[00:57.960 --> 01:00.240]  But anything that you said makes sense to you.
[01:00.680 --> 01:03.860]  Yeah, that's my point. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It works for me.
[01:04.240 --> 01:07.580]  I don't think that's always the case. I say stuff that doesn't make sense to me constantly.
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.140]  Yeah, that's fair. I do confuse myself a lot.
[01:10.140 --> 01:10.720]  That is also true.
[01:10.720 --> 01:13.180]  You do too. The amount of times that you say something, you go, what?
[01:13.620 --> 01:14.640]  That doesn't come out right.
[01:15.060 --> 01:20.820]  Also, you just didn't even really poke that hard and Andrew just started agreeing with you
[01:20.820 --> 01:24.120]  where everything he says to himself makes sense. And then you went,
[01:24.120 --> 01:27.400]  well, I don't do that. And he went, yeah, yeah.
[01:28.200 --> 01:30.500]  Oh, okay. So what is this?
[01:31.180 --> 01:35.680]  Well, it makes sense. I think when I'm saying it and then there's time for reflection and review.
[01:36.100 --> 01:38.600]  Like, do you have people in your family or in your life
[01:39.960 --> 01:42.360]  who never understand what you're on about?
[01:42.440 --> 01:42.720]  No.
[01:45.780 --> 01:47.000]  So you're saying...
[01:47.900 --> 01:51.260]  Are we all excluded from this part of the conversation?
[01:51.620 --> 01:53.020]  Speak for yourself, dude.
[01:53.020 --> 01:58.940]  You're like a genetic thing where you're understood by family.
[01:59.040 --> 02:00.920]  Like it was like a nature nurture situation.
[02:01.180 --> 02:06.960]  Sort of like all the Scooby-Doo family members and all understand each other in some innate way.
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.500]  I'm pretty sure I got popcorn seeds from my family.
[02:11.040 --> 02:13.460]  I'm almost... I'm 95% sure.
[02:14.240 --> 02:16.860]  I haven't tested this yet. I need to.
[02:17.520 --> 02:20.880]  Why don't you text a family member about corn?
[02:21.440 --> 02:21.960]  Okay.
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.020]  Um.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.080]  Text.
[02:27.680 --> 02:28.560]  Boo up the cell phone.
[02:29.200 --> 02:30.840]  Family member about corn.
[02:31.480 --> 02:32.400]  As one does.
[02:32.640 --> 02:35.900]  I just want to be as vague as possible with instructions to see how this comes out.
[02:36.300 --> 02:37.460]  Oh, yeah. Good idea.
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.100]  Okay. I'm sending a text right now.
[02:44.500 --> 02:46.840]  That is, what are those things called
[02:46.840 --> 02:53.620]  in a microwavable popcorn bag that don't pop?
[02:56.620 --> 02:59.580]  And you think they're going to say popcorn seeds?
[02:59.840 --> 03:00.760]  Yeah, I do.
[03:05.480 --> 03:08.040]  That's awesome. That's great.
[03:08.660 --> 03:10.680]  I hope they do say seeds.
[03:10.980 --> 03:13.760]  God, me too. Right now, I'm hoping for seeds.
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.680]  What are the things called in a microwavable popcorn bag that don't
[03:16.680 --> 03:17.280]  pop?
[03:19.300 --> 03:21.260]  Wait, that don't pop?
[03:21.900 --> 03:22.100]  Yeah.
[03:22.400 --> 03:28.600]  Could you imagine, Gavin, could you imagine getting that text from anyone in your family?
[03:31.860 --> 03:32.860]  Definitely not.
[03:33.440 --> 03:37.980]  I actually I have a pretty good story from my mom recently.
[03:38.320 --> 03:40.040]  We're talking about gift cards.
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.920]  Last episode, it was my mom's birthday a few days ago on the 15th.
[03:44.920 --> 03:48.000]  And oh, we're getting a response.
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.580]  There's a text bubble going.
[03:51.740 --> 03:54.620]  Okay, well, listen, I was just, oh boy.
[03:55.020 --> 03:56.060]  Kernels was the reply.
[03:56.380 --> 03:57.340]  That's really unfortunate.
[03:57.560 --> 03:59.040]  I don't know where I got seeds from.
[04:02.660 --> 04:06.320]  You can type that to a few people and see if you get three kernels back.
[04:07.980 --> 04:08.560]  Oh, yeah.
[04:08.680 --> 04:09.540]  Okay, I'll keep texting.
[04:09.540 --> 04:15.080]  Um, it was her birthday.
[04:15.200 --> 04:17.600]  She got a gift card, went to one of her favorite places.
[04:17.860 --> 04:19.820]  She's just going to buy like an item or two.
[04:19.980 --> 04:23.040]  And they also have snacks and like drinks and stuff in this place.
[04:23.260 --> 04:30.820]  And they happen to have 12 bottles, 12 one liter bottles of Perrier on sale for like $10.
[04:31.300 --> 04:32.460]  She loves water.
[04:32.520 --> 04:33.440]  She loves sparkling water.
[04:33.920 --> 04:35.120]  And so she bought these.
[04:37.560 --> 04:41.540]  And the place where she bought them from their carts.
[04:41.600 --> 04:43.340]  Don't let you leave the store with them.
[04:43.380 --> 04:45.980]  They have brakes that get triggered if you try to leave the store.
[04:46.140 --> 04:47.000]  Is that real?
[04:47.640 --> 04:48.920]  Yeah, we have those in Austin, dude.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.880]  I saw the sign for the AGB.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.440]  I even took a picture of it.
[04:52.520 --> 04:53.900]  I was like, that's not real.
[04:54.080 --> 04:54.600]  Is that real?
[04:54.980 --> 04:56.260]  100% fucking real.
[04:56.360 --> 04:57.240]  It's really annoying.
[04:57.880 --> 05:02.540]  They just it's it's like the theft, essentially, like scanner thing, I believe.
[05:02.540 --> 05:08.460]  There's a line that you cross and it like kicks pieces down that essentially work like
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.500]  brakes on the wheels.
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.080]  It's like you put those little knobs down in your room and then a Roomba knows not to go past it.
[05:15.420 --> 05:18.840]  Oh, look, yeah, look, here's the it's the picture I took.
[05:19.280 --> 05:20.260]  Oh, let me see it.
[05:20.680 --> 05:21.380]  Wow, that's crazy.
[05:21.400 --> 05:24.800]  Because I looked at that and I was like, what a load of bullshit that is.
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.060]  Warning, attention shoppers.
[05:29.120 --> 05:31.920]  Shopping cart wheels may lock unexpectedly if removed from the store.
[05:32.540 --> 05:35.700]  Shopping cart wheels will lock if taken beyond the parking lot.
[05:35.920 --> 05:37.380]  So at least they give the parking lot.
[05:37.680 --> 05:41.780]  This is if you try to leave the store, they're going to lock on you.
[05:42.520 --> 05:48.660]  So she bought three gallons of Perrier, essentially, for like $10, which is this great sale.
[05:50.160 --> 05:54.700]  And I called her because it was her birthday to wish her happy birthday.
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.300]  I was like, hey, happy birthday.
[05:56.300 --> 05:57.140]  How's your day going?
[05:57.140 --> 06:04.060]  And she sounded terrible and was like, oh, it's not it's not going good right now.
[06:04.340 --> 06:05.240]  I'm not having a good time.
[06:05.300 --> 06:06.340]  And I'm like, what's going on?
[06:06.620 --> 06:09.240]  And she explained this great Perrier deal that she had.
[06:09.700 --> 06:12.760]  The problem was she couldn't remember where she parked.
[06:13.420 --> 06:16.240]  So she had just spent the past like 15 minutes
[06:16.240 --> 06:19.900]  walking around the parking lot with three gallons of Perrier.
[06:20.280 --> 06:21.460]  But she did not anticipate.
[06:21.680 --> 06:23.920]  She went there to buy two things that were light.
[06:24.340 --> 06:26.700]  And now she's just hauling this Perrier around.
[06:27.300 --> 06:29.320]  And she was like, oh, it's real bad.
[06:29.460 --> 06:30.580]  I can't find the car.
[06:30.820 --> 06:32.660]  I've been I've been going for 15 minutes.
[06:32.880 --> 06:35.540]  I'm going to be I might have to start losing some of this Perrier.
[06:35.740 --> 06:36.760]  It's getting too heavy.
[06:37.140 --> 06:38.420]  Well, she's got to start drinking it.
[06:38.780 --> 06:44.340]  I just getting dropping the cargo, essentially, as she tries to find the car.
[06:45.160 --> 06:48.440]  And so I said, OK, well, that's I'm so sorry you're going through that.
[06:48.800 --> 06:52.020]  Why don't you call me back whenever you find the vehicle?
[06:52.760 --> 06:54.140]  And that was the plan.
[06:54.660 --> 07:00.240]  And then as each I don't know, every five minutes, I would feel progressively worse
[07:00.240 --> 07:04.760]  as we reached 10 minutes and then 20 minutes and then 30 minutes.
[07:04.980 --> 07:07.760]  Well, it sounds like you gave her no advice on how to find the car.
[07:08.480 --> 07:13.080]  I gave the only advice I could, which was, have you tried using the key
[07:13.720 --> 07:16.320]  to like create a beeping noise?
[07:16.660 --> 07:16.860]  Yeah.
[07:16.940 --> 07:18.460]  Follow the alarm off or something.
[07:18.580 --> 07:20.400]  Yeah, that's so I suggest.
[07:20.520 --> 07:22.720]  And then she said she had still couldn't find it.
[07:23.400 --> 07:31.280]  About 40 minutes pass and then I finally get a call back and she had to lose the
[07:31.280 --> 07:35.960]  like a movie in which the like plane has too much weight in it.
[07:36.140 --> 07:38.760]  She opened up after we called.
[07:39.040 --> 07:44.620]  She opened up the bag of Perrier and started putting bottles down as just
[07:44.620 --> 07:47.000]  she can't carry the weight anymore, but she wants to keep moving.
[07:47.220 --> 07:48.360]  Like dealing with ballast.
[07:48.740 --> 07:49.120]  Exactly.
[07:49.700 --> 07:53.460]  So by the time she found the car, she had emptied half the bag.
[07:54.500 --> 07:58.460]  So she had six bottles of Perrier just throughout the parking lot.
[07:58.800 --> 07:59.940]  She got it.
[08:00.480 --> 08:01.720]  So she gets to the car.
[08:01.860 --> 08:07.400]  She puts the six remaining that are still in the bag in the car, grabs a bag from the car
[08:07.400 --> 08:12.840]  and then backtracks and repicks up the six bottles that she had previously left.
[08:14.000 --> 08:14.800]  Recovered them.
[08:16.100 --> 08:17.080]  Absolute nightmare.
[08:17.080 --> 08:20.800]  I just can't imagine being a security guard looking at the cameras.
[08:21.940 --> 08:23.260]  She gets them all back.
[08:23.840 --> 08:24.720]  She gets home.
[08:25.260 --> 08:26.960]  She takes half of them.
[08:27.060 --> 08:31.860]  She takes the ones that she carried in the bag into the house with everything.
[08:32.340 --> 08:32.920]  Exhausted.
[08:33.220 --> 08:34.140]  Just done with the day.
[08:35.060 --> 08:37.020]  Next day, she goes out.
[08:37.720 --> 08:44.300]  Because of, I guess, all of the exhaustion and just busyness of the day, she forgot to
[08:44.300 --> 08:45.760]  lock her car at night.
[08:45.880 --> 08:51.320]  And somebody has stolen the other six bottles of Perrier from her vehicle that she left.
[08:51.680 --> 08:53.640]  Who steals Perrier?
[08:54.360 --> 08:57.620]  It was in a bag, I guess, with a few other things.
[08:58.280 --> 09:05.260]  And somebody in, I'm guessing, the apartment parking just saw it and
[09:05.260 --> 09:07.720]  opened the door and then just walked out with it.
[09:07.840 --> 09:09.300]  So they were just trying doors?
[09:10.180 --> 09:11.300]  I would assume so.
[09:11.340 --> 09:16.100]  Or maybe they saw like a large bag that appeared like it had a bunch of stuff in it.
[09:16.120 --> 09:17.700]  So then they just tried it and it worked.
[09:18.020 --> 09:20.880]  But I've seen dudes walk through parking lot just trying doors before.
[09:21.300 --> 09:22.360]  That wouldn't surprise me.
[09:22.500 --> 09:26.660]  But yeah, all of that work, having to lose the cargo, recover the cargo,
[09:27.260 --> 09:29.660]  just to lose the cargo again from the car.
[09:30.520 --> 09:32.120]  So down six Perriers.
[09:32.580 --> 09:34.100]  Just an absolute nightmare.
[09:34.480 --> 09:35.320]  Definitely related.
[09:35.540 --> 09:36.920]  Can we buy six new ones?
[09:37.860 --> 09:39.140]  I don't think so.
[09:39.300 --> 09:41.920]  I don't think she wants to think about Perrier for a while.
[09:45.830 --> 09:46.570]  I'll text.
[09:47.550 --> 09:49.850]  I'll say, what about popcorn seeds, though?
[09:51.470 --> 09:52.310]  What's leading the witness?
[09:52.970 --> 09:54.250]  So you have to leave.
[09:54.350 --> 09:56.290]  You're like, I got it from these people.
[09:56.630 --> 09:58.670]  And then when they said kernels, you're like, hang on,
[09:58.690 --> 10:01.070]  I have to remind them of popcorn seeds.
[10:01.210 --> 10:02.450]  But what if you said it this way?
[10:02.790 --> 10:06.550]  Yeah. Hey, can you just text me back popcorn seeds real quick?
[10:09.270 --> 10:12.290]  I swear, I listen.
[10:12.610 --> 10:14.650]  I keep saying, listen, I need to stop that.
[10:14.710 --> 10:15.830]  I don't know what's going on today.
[10:15.990 --> 10:17.630]  It's it's really it's reflective.
[10:19.090 --> 10:23.650]  I I keep thinking about popcorn seeds because I don't feel like I created that.
[10:24.470 --> 10:27.410]  I had a moment where I thought maybe it's a Canadian thing.
[10:27.650 --> 10:31.410]  And so I looked it up and I could not find a use of popcorn seeds anywhere.
[10:31.950 --> 10:33.050]  So I don't think it is.
[10:33.130 --> 10:35.910]  I don't know where that came from, but it is a microwave.
[10:35.910 --> 10:39.650]  I feel like we should sell a shirt that just says popcorn seeds.
[10:40.170 --> 10:42.330]  It doesn't even make sense.
[10:43.510 --> 10:45.630]  Well, I mean, it's the seeds, right?
[10:46.510 --> 10:47.650]  The corn of seed.
[10:48.010 --> 10:48.710]  Seed corn.
[10:49.110 --> 10:50.030]  The corn of seed.
[10:50.530 --> 10:51.750]  Oh, my God.
[10:52.910 --> 10:53.350]  Um.
[10:54.670 --> 10:57.690]  I had a random thought that I'd like to share with you guys
[10:57.690 --> 10:59.670]  that maybe you could help me fill this out a little bit.
[11:00.250 --> 11:00.890]  You make a board.
[11:00.950 --> 11:02.130]  I haven't made a board yet for this.
[11:02.770 --> 11:09.670]  I was thinking about movies and how they largely take place in like New York or L.A.
[11:10.190 --> 11:11.970]  And it'll be like Vancouver as New York.
[11:12.110 --> 11:15.430]  But it's like a lot of movies take place in L.A. or New York.
[11:16.110 --> 11:21.970]  Do you think we could find a theatrical, like a large release, not like some indie movie,
[11:22.150 --> 11:29.250]  but like a big theatrical release where the story took place in each state?
[11:30.010 --> 11:33.650]  Like, could we represent each state across movies?
[11:34.290 --> 11:37.390]  Now, you're saying like filmed there or?
[11:37.670 --> 11:40.910]  No, I'm saying that they declare that they are from there.
[11:40.990 --> 11:41.270]  Yeah.
[11:41.390 --> 11:42.570]  Like about there.
[11:42.690 --> 11:42.910]  OK.
[11:43.010 --> 11:48.910]  I feel like I've seen infographics on Reddit showing that,
[11:49.050 --> 11:51.170]  like most popular movie about each state.
[11:51.330 --> 11:52.950]  So I would assume you could do it.
[11:53.110 --> 11:53.330]  Yeah.
[11:54.850 --> 11:58.070]  Because there are certain states that I just feel like are not represented at all.
[11:58.630 --> 11:59.590]  Well, like Wyoming.
[11:59.990 --> 12:01.550]  Yeah. Vermont.
[12:02.070 --> 12:05.150]  Like they're just if you're going to make a map of the U.S.,
[12:05.930 --> 12:07.030]  the most famous movie set.
[12:07.330 --> 12:08.310]  Oh, this is great.
[12:08.570 --> 12:10.090]  I just pulled that up.
[12:10.170 --> 12:10.710]  I beat you to it.
[12:10.710 --> 12:12.010]  There's some big movies.
[12:12.530 --> 12:14.450]  It took you time to open your eyes and start looking.
[12:14.770 --> 12:16.650]  So I had to open my eyes.
[12:16.970 --> 12:19.510]  In all of California, the most famous movie is Clueless.
[12:19.750 --> 12:21.410]  Yeah, some of these are terrible.
[12:21.730 --> 12:22.810]  Words out of my mouth.
[12:24.410 --> 12:28.930]  The hangover representing Nevada is just a goddamn shame.
[12:29.470 --> 12:31.570]  I would probably put Casino.
[12:31.870 --> 12:32.470]  Absolutely.
[12:33.330 --> 12:34.310]  Yeah, I would too.
[12:34.810 --> 12:38.690]  I would put National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation over the hangover.
[12:40.530 --> 12:43.050]  Well, maybe we should create our own list.
[12:43.570 --> 12:44.970]  Yeah, I think that's sort of what I'm saying.
[12:45.490 --> 12:46.190]  Yeah, that's it.
[12:46.490 --> 12:49.890]  Like the regulation movie map.
[12:49.890 --> 12:54.230]  Yeah, because Gavin, you've almost visited every stater.
[12:54.350 --> 12:57.910]  That's like sort of a side goal of like, because you've already been to so many.
[12:58.750 --> 12:59.770]  I've done like 30 something.
[13:00.210 --> 13:02.950]  Yeah, the visual equivalent of that.
[13:03.310 --> 13:06.410]  The ability to see stories set in all these places.
[13:07.210 --> 13:08.350]  Okay, Geoff has another one.
[13:08.810 --> 13:09.870]  Pulp Fiction for California.
[13:10.550 --> 13:13.150]  Casino for Nevada.
[13:13.210 --> 13:14.350]  50-50?
[13:14.690 --> 13:15.010]  Really?
[13:15.630 --> 13:18.310]  Did Psycho take place in Arizona?
[13:18.990 --> 13:19.710]  What? Really?
[13:20.690 --> 13:21.190]  I didn't know that.
[13:21.710 --> 13:23.570]  I had no idea.
[13:25.030 --> 13:27.670]  I haven't heard of a lot of these.
[13:28.490 --> 13:30.270]  Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.
[13:30.690 --> 13:31.970]  What have you not heard of?
[13:33.870 --> 13:35.890]  Mr. Deeds Goes to Town.
[13:36.050 --> 13:39.450]  Give me the list of things you haven't heard of now.
[13:39.890 --> 13:40.950]  Bringing Up Baby.
[13:42.610 --> 13:44.410]  Why does Foggo get two states?
[13:44.770 --> 13:46.190]  I was about to say the same thing.
[13:46.470 --> 13:46.730]  Yeah.
[13:47.270 --> 13:50.370]  I think it's because the movie doesn't take place in Fargo.
[13:51.150 --> 13:55.290]  The only time he's in Fargo is when he goes to hire the dudes.
[13:55.870 --> 13:57.710]  He drives to Fargo to see them.
[13:58.230 --> 14:01.650]  Yeah, the whole rest of the movie takes place in like somewhere else.
[14:02.510 --> 14:06.670]  They just didn't want to call it the name of the place because Fargo was a better name.
[14:06.850 --> 14:09.430]  I just saw TikTok about this, which means it's probably not true.
[14:10.210 --> 14:15.310]  But yeah, no, I think, assuming I'm wrong, I think the only scene in the film that takes
[14:15.310 --> 14:19.110]  place in Fargo is when he hires Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi.
[14:20.150 --> 14:23.410]  That's fascinating because I think of that as the Fargo movie.
[14:23.670 --> 14:24.670]  Well, it's in the name.
[14:25.190 --> 14:27.050]  It is based on a true story.
[14:27.510 --> 14:30.470]  But yeah, a lot of these are very old but famous films, Andrew.
[14:30.550 --> 14:33.250]  Mr. Deeds Goes to Town is like from the 1940s, probably.
[14:34.010 --> 14:39.090]  Bringing Up Baby is a huge famous film from, I want to say, maybe the 50s.
[14:39.430 --> 14:39.710]  OK.
[14:40.090 --> 14:43.650]  I've never heard of Hatchie, A Dog's Tale, but I think I've...
[14:43.650 --> 14:45.090]  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, famous movie.
[14:45.470 --> 14:46.230]  Jimmy Stewart, I believe.
[14:46.650 --> 14:52.110]  Now, do you think the Adam Sandler film Mr. Deeds has any connection to Mr. Deeds Goes to Town?
[14:52.290 --> 14:53.250]  Spiritual successor.
[14:53.790 --> 14:54.270]  Possibly.
[14:57.130 --> 15:02.490]  Speaking of old movies, I was thinking about, you know, GTA V, biggest game ever.
[15:03.210 --> 15:03.690]  Huge.
[15:03.870 --> 15:09.370]  Like the concept of playing a game and not being aware of GTA V is just sort of like
[15:09.370 --> 15:10.530]  an impossible thing to think about.
[15:10.670 --> 15:12.110]  What do you mean by biggest game ever?
[15:12.110 --> 15:14.130]  Well, just like it feels like culturally.
[15:14.490 --> 15:15.930]  It's it's massive.
[15:16.270 --> 15:16.890]  Maybe not ever.
[15:17.150 --> 15:18.090]  That's probably not accurate.
[15:18.210 --> 15:21.850]  It's probably Minecraft or Fortnite or...
[15:21.850 --> 15:23.190]  Tetris, probably, I believe.
[15:23.750 --> 15:25.690]  You think more people play Tetris than GTA V?
[15:26.450 --> 15:26.690]  Yeah.
[15:27.310 --> 15:27.790]  Played?
[15:27.810 --> 15:28.170]  Yes.
[15:28.890 --> 15:29.350]  Sales?
[15:29.430 --> 15:29.670]  No.
[15:31.230 --> 15:34.190]  They have shark cards for Tetris or no?
[15:36.310 --> 15:38.130]  If you guys want to know the list, I have it.
[15:38.130 --> 15:42.350]  It's number one is Tetris with 520 million sales.
[15:42.570 --> 15:45.730]  Number two is Minecraft with 300 million sales.
[15:45.890 --> 15:48.850]  Number three is Grand Theft Auto V with 200 million sales.
[15:49.470 --> 15:53.530]  Tetris has sold more than almost three times what Grand Theft Auto has sold.
[15:53.650 --> 15:56.910]  But wouldn't people wouldn't that be people buying multiple copies of Tetris?
[15:57.090 --> 15:59.750]  I assume it's multiple copies of GTA V.
[16:00.050 --> 16:01.330]  How many copies of GTA V do you own?
[16:01.350 --> 16:01.990]  Because I own three.
[16:03.330 --> 16:04.490]  That's a fair point.
[16:05.050 --> 16:08.730]  I didn't even think about, yeah, generate like console generational rebuying.
[16:08.930 --> 16:10.990]  I was thinking more shark cards.
[16:11.570 --> 16:13.530]  What's the Tetris that they're talking about?
[16:13.570 --> 16:14.790]  Is it anything called Tetris?
[16:14.850 --> 16:16.530]  Because there's only one thing called GTA V.
[16:16.810 --> 16:21.050]  Even though it's been re-released across consoles, Tetris has like...
[16:21.050 --> 16:24.510]  There's Game Boy Tetris, but then there's like Tetris Worlds and all like that stuff.
[16:24.610 --> 16:28.030]  I'm assuming they're just calling like the base game Tetris.
[16:28.690 --> 16:30.430]  I also don't know why we're arguing about this.
[16:30.530 --> 16:32.490]  Tetris has sold 520 million copies.
[16:33.030 --> 16:33.970]  Grand Theft Auto was huge.
[16:33.970 --> 16:35.790]  Tetris has also had a huge head start.
[16:35.850 --> 16:36.730]  It's been around a lot longer.
[16:36.930 --> 16:40.590]  I'm just saying culturally, it is the highest selling video game of all time.
[16:40.610 --> 16:42.130]  And nothing comes close to Tetris.
[16:42.790 --> 16:46.910]  With the... in the context that I was thinking about, we've all been...
[16:47.690 --> 16:51.090]  Well, you know, we're all close to the beginning of video games.
[16:51.570 --> 16:54.470]  Some of us were around for when they first started.
[16:57.630 --> 16:58.870]  Some of us.
[16:59.090 --> 17:00.910]  That was very polite of you.
[17:01.690 --> 17:02.390]  Thanks, man.
[17:02.490 --> 17:03.150]  Well, I'm 94.
[17:03.150 --> 17:07.190]  So it's like I miss Nintendo consoles, but I'm within reach.
[17:07.210 --> 17:08.770]  Like that stuff is accessible to me.
[17:08.990 --> 17:16.510]  I was using GTA 5 because when I think of what game companies are probably going to exist
[17:16.510 --> 17:22.070]  for the foreseeable future, I feel like Rockstar is a pretty safe bet that they'll be around.
[17:23.270 --> 17:30.970]  And in the world of let's say, let's go to like 2060 and we're at GTA 7 because it takes a while.
[17:33.150 --> 17:40.870]  When we look back on GTA 5, first of all, do you think GTA 5 will even be like a consideration
[17:41.710 --> 17:43.770]  in the future like that?
[17:43.850 --> 17:44.330]  For what?
[17:44.790 --> 17:51.390]  For like the way that the average consumer now thinks about a movie in the 1930s,
[17:51.410 --> 17:55.610]  like it's just not even even though they were incredibly influential at the time,
[17:55.770 --> 18:00.070]  there's just no thought of what was popular or relevant at that time period.
[18:00.070 --> 18:08.390]  Do you think that in like 2060, there will be any awareness of GTA 5 or is it just purely a...
[18:08.390 --> 18:14.330]  I mean, I think there'll be an awareness of GTA, you know, but GTA 5 itself, I don't,
[18:14.410 --> 18:19.470]  I mean, I think they've already, the GTA that's alive and successful and thriving right now,
[18:19.630 --> 18:23.070]  they don't even really call GTA 5 when they talk about it, they call it GTA Online.
[18:23.450 --> 18:26.930]  You know, I think they're already trying to distance themselves from the name and make
[18:26.930 --> 18:31.870]  Online GTA, which is what people, I think, really give a shit about its own thing.
[18:32.170 --> 18:32.750]  You know what I mean?
[18:33.250 --> 18:37.510]  Like, I think that Rockstar themselves are trying to draw a line between the two and
[18:37.510 --> 18:41.850]  make GTA Online like the thing that people remember less so GTA 5.
[18:42.390 --> 18:44.970]  That's fair. I mean, they sell it individually.
[18:46.330 --> 18:51.330]  And it comes out after the narrative part, typically, at least with both Red Dead and
[18:51.330 --> 18:56.270]  GTA 5 into the story. I was just thinking about, because video games aren't old enough
[18:56.270 --> 19:04.090]  to have that full arc, and it'd be funny to have, like, Rockstar is one of the publishers
[19:04.090 --> 19:11.250]  of L.A. Noire, and that is like such a stylized, like, old-fashioned game to go back to GTA 5
[19:11.250 --> 19:17.710]  in the future and have the same feeling. Like, would a current day person in 2060 look at
[19:17.710 --> 19:20.750]  GTA 5 the same way that we look at L.A. Noire now?
[19:21.170 --> 19:22.670]  Well, like it's a period piece.
[19:22.670 --> 19:29.490]  Yes. To me, it's interesting thinking about how things will flip to a period piece.
[19:29.910 --> 19:34.510]  I mean, even GTA 4 you play now, and it's like the old T9 phone and you've got to go to an
[19:34.510 --> 19:42.670]  internet cafe and stuff. I mean, I think 2060 is too far out. I think that it'll be weird and
[19:42.670 --> 19:49.490]  novel and like us playing L.A. Noire in like 2040. Really?
[19:50.130 --> 19:52.190]  I mean, look how fast technology is going.
[19:52.810 --> 19:55.490]  Oh, super fast. Yeah, it's just it's a...
[19:56.010 --> 20:01.910]  I mean, that's 2040 is 20... let's say 2044. That's 20 years from now. 20 years ago,
[20:02.010 --> 20:05.630]  we didn't have social media. I don't know if I had a cell phone 20 years ago.
[20:06.250 --> 20:09.850]  Yeah, I did. I got one when I was 25. So I just had one. You know what I mean? Like,
[20:10.330 --> 20:14.350]  a lot can happen in a few years. A whole hell of a lot's going to happen in the next 40-something
[20:14.350 --> 20:14.710]  years.
[20:15.470 --> 20:18.230]  That's a very good point. I just wonder if we've hit
[20:19.710 --> 20:26.770]  an area in which it's less about new tech and more like efficiency and building more off of
[20:26.770 --> 20:33.670]  what's established as opposed to the idea of like a touch phone, a touchscreen phone.
[20:34.190 --> 20:38.170]  It would be interesting to see if one of these online services went on so long that they updated
[20:38.170 --> 20:45.550]  all the technology in it. I mean, I wonder if what our relationship with video games will be like
[20:45.550 --> 20:54.530]  in 2060, you know? Like, at what point are we playing it in our brains and it's just on a chip,
[20:54.750 --> 20:58.730]  you know? And then, you know, and then I can close my eyes while I'm recording the podcast
[20:58.730 --> 21:02.050]  and play GTA 5 while I'm talking to you guys and my hands are free.
[21:02.730 --> 21:09.370]  It is hard to imagine a world without controllers because we've tried so hard to get away from them
[21:09.370 --> 21:14.490]  and every attempt has been terrible. Like the premise of that there would be a different
[21:14.490 --> 21:21.970]  and I imagine at the time, I imagine whatever the current tech is, people had a hard time
[21:21.970 --> 21:27.050]  imagining the evolution of it. So even though I can't really comprehend a world in which
[21:27.050 --> 21:33.710]  controllers would be a secondary way or like a non-preferred usage, it'll be fascinating to see
[21:33.710 --> 21:41.390]  all that stuff evolves. Yeah, I think it really will be fascinating and living long enough now
[21:41.390 --> 21:46.830]  that I've kind of gone through a couple of or seen and experienced a couple of generational cycles.
[21:47.030 --> 21:54.330]  The crazy thing is, it's like, it will never, it never looks or behaves
[21:55.450 --> 22:03.090]  or is released anywhere near to the way your mind envisioned it, you know? We talk about this
[22:03.090 --> 22:08.010]  with cord cutting, right? And about how we used to bitch about cable and this has come up a lot
[22:08.010 --> 22:14.090]  and the future was going to be decentralized television where we could a la carte what we
[22:14.090 --> 22:17.690]  want because why the fuck am I paying for ESPN if I don't like sports, right? And then here we are
[22:17.690 --> 22:21.950]  20 years later and we have it and it's a big steaming pile of shit and it doesn't look anything
[22:21.950 --> 22:27.190]  like we envisioned it looking and yet we're stuck with it, you know what I mean? So it's just like,
[22:27.250 --> 22:33.870]  it's so hard to project what things are going to look like because, well, in a lot of situations,
[22:33.870 --> 22:40.150]  because after it's discovered or created, it's then built by the lowest bidder and so it barely
[22:40.150 --> 22:43.590]  works anyway. I just think about how annoying games are going to be. Like, they're already,
[22:43.850 --> 22:48.850]  you've already got to like keep accepting a EULA every time they update it and sometimes the
[22:48.850 --> 22:53.250]  playlist that you like is just gone for some reason. I think that's all going to get way worse.
[22:53.690 --> 22:56.750]  I can see that. People are like, oh, remember Warzone? You'd be like, which...
[22:57.550 --> 23:02.690]  Yeah, but we've seen stuff get worse and better. Like, we've bitched a lot about Call of Duty in
[23:02.690 --> 23:06.290]  the past and how complicated it is to get into a game of Call of Duty. But I got to be honest,
[23:06.370 --> 23:10.650]  Black Ops 6 is pretty great. And I have no issues with the menus in Black Ops 6. Like, it's like,
[23:10.710 --> 23:15.550]  they've definitely made that easier again. And so who knows, maybe, maybe some of the future
[23:15.550 --> 23:20.170]  can be good. Oh, for sure. And it'll be interesting to see the impact of accessibility.
[23:22.350 --> 23:26.810]  Hey, it's Eric. When was the last time you needed to go to the doctor, but you pushed it off? You
[23:26.810 --> 23:33.270]  made an excuse. Oh, I'm too busy. Oh, it'll heal. Take time. I don't need help. Throw all that out.
[23:33.390 --> 23:41.790]  We're done with that. In 2025, excuses are over. Don't settle for making excuses. ZocDoc is a
[23:41.790 --> 23:48.470]  free app and website where you can search and compare high quality in-network doctors and click
[23:48.470 --> 23:54.970]  to instantly book an appointment. We're talking about booking in-network appointments with more
[23:54.970 --> 23:59.650]  than 100,000 doctors across every specialty. So it doesn't matter if it's primary or urgent care,
[23:59.690 --> 24:04.570]  health or dental, anything that you need. You can also filter for doctors who take your insurance
[24:04.570 --> 24:10.590]  located nearby that are a good fit for what you need and are highly rated by verified patients.
[24:10.790 --> 24:15.170]  Once you find the right doctor, you can see actual appointment openings, choose a time slot
[24:15.170 --> 24:21.650]  that works for you and click to book instantly. Appointments made through ZocDoc also happen fast,
[24:21.650 --> 24:26.530]  typically within 24 to 72 hours of booking, and you can even score some same-day appointments.
[24:26.670 --> 24:30.570]  Like if I was looking for a doctor, if I needed someone new in my life to help me with any of
[24:30.570 --> 24:35.750]  these things, ZocDoc is what I would be using. So stop putting off those doctor's appointments and
[24:35.750 --> 24:43.210]  go to ZocDoc.com slash regulation to find and instantly book a top-rated doctor today. That's
[24:43.210 --> 24:50.750]  Z-O-C-D-O-C.com slash regulation. ZocDoc.com slash regulation.
[24:52.630 --> 24:57.110]  So when I was like thinking about this, I was like, well, what was the most highest? What was
[24:57.110 --> 25:03.150]  the highest grossing film in 1930? And I googled it and I learned it's a movie called Whoopie,
[25:03.350 --> 25:09.070]  and it is a Western musical. And I had never heard of it, never considered it. I was like, whoop,
[25:09.110 --> 25:14.510]  that's a fucking ridiculous title. Looked into it and I immediately had the ability to watch it.
[25:14.630 --> 25:20.190]  I thought, that's so cool. I had, it was through, it was streaming on Amazon Prime. I have Amazon
[25:20.190 --> 25:24.890]  Prime. So I watched like the first 10 minutes of Whoopie. Yeah, I saw the poster and went,
[25:25.070 --> 25:34.450]  oh boy, this is probably going to be incredibly insensitive in countless ways. A product of the
[25:35.310 --> 25:43.210]  1930s. So far, it's just a bunch of people yelling Whoopie and it seems fine, but it's just so cool
[25:43.210 --> 25:48.710]  that we live in a time in which you can get an immediate answer to something like that.
[25:48.710 --> 25:52.830]  And then not only learn about it, but have the ability to watch it. It's crazy.
[25:53.030 --> 25:59.210]  I always think about that when I find old film or like a really old picture of one of my great
[25:59.210 --> 26:03.250]  grandparents or a grandparent. And you look at it and you think, oh, well, I wonder what he was
[26:03.250 --> 26:10.470]  like? Try and get little stories. But for us, in 80 years, people could see me get my anus waxed
[26:10.470 --> 26:18.190]  on the internet. And I just think it's a bit of a different vibe. Like, do I want my descendants
[26:18.190 --> 26:24.710]  watching my anus get waxed? Might be a little late to be having this conversation with yourself,
[26:24.770 --> 26:30.310]  my man. Yeah, I mean, that's the career path I took. Also, who knows what survives? I mean,
[26:30.790 --> 26:36.970]  honestly, like Rooster Teeth turned off, you know, all that stuff, the internet archive goes away.
[26:37.150 --> 26:42.410]  If that, if that, what is it, the archive of pimps goes away, then that stuff just doesn't
[26:42.410 --> 26:46.690]  exist anymore unless you have it on your computer somewhere. So yeah, but I think enough people have
[26:46.690 --> 26:51.970]  enough versions of it. Like people could track down an ancestral painting, which there's one of,
[26:52.410 --> 26:56.430]  and they still manage to find them. I feel like... Yeah, except that there's a subreddit that I
[26:56.430 --> 26:59.570]  follow called Lost Media, where people are constantly looking for stuff that's been
[26:59.570 --> 27:03.810]  disappeared from the internet. You know, it's, I think it's easier for stuff to go away than you
[27:03.810 --> 27:10.150]  think it is. Who knows how much lost media I may have had on a computer that just died today,
[27:10.590 --> 27:15.230]  you know, that I was holding on to. And then that doesn't even take into account the stuff that's
[27:15.230 --> 27:20.770]  still around, but in like an edited form. Like people patch movies and TV shows constantly,
[27:20.850 --> 27:25.170]  we just don't notice. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's a great, that's a great point. That would be a
[27:25.170 --> 27:30.610]  really interesting and terrifying service of the future of, you know how there's like
[27:30.610 --> 27:36.730]  ancestry.com now, where like you can look at your family tree visually. The premise of having like
[27:37.510 --> 27:43.950]  a family trees digital library, like you could pay to find like all of the YouTube accounts or
[27:43.950 --> 27:50.030]  social media profiles, whatever's existing to see those feeds of your relatives that you never met
[27:50.030 --> 27:59.630]  would be insane. Also like strangely fascinating, I guess, to see. What if you went back far enough
[27:59.630 --> 28:08.490]  and your earliest ancestor was missing link do? Oh, damn. I'd hope that Eric would get a tattoo
[28:08.490 --> 28:15.050]  of them. Yeah. Yeah. If that was my like, like real old relative missing link do big back piece.
[28:15.170 --> 28:21.790]  I got it. It's their YouTube channels. Tune in and miss link do. We're going to try some chips.
[28:22.110 --> 28:28.910]  I need some chips today. These are the new Pringles pops. See, there you go. He figured it
[28:28.910 --> 28:34.010]  out. Hey, did Mr. Beast rent the pyramids? Is that something we can do? Can we rent the pyramids?
[28:34.010 --> 28:41.010]  I don't know what you're talking about. What? I don't know what it means to rent the pyramids
[28:41.010 --> 28:45.250]  to like you could have them for like like a movie theater to go watch Mortal Kombat.
[28:45.550 --> 28:51.170]  Like you can just like rent the pyramids because you can't you can't like climb them or anything.
[28:51.730 --> 28:58.090]  You just look at them, right? You go into them beats me. It just feels weird to rent a thing
[28:58.090 --> 29:04.410]  that is visual and massive. Like what if somebody were to look at the pyramids? Are they not allowed
[29:04.410 --> 29:10.310]  to right now because he's Mr. Beast has rented them. How does that work? What are you renting?
[29:10.410 --> 29:14.950]  They probably don't have access to them, maybe. Maybe he wants to tent them like they do with
[29:14.950 --> 29:21.090]  a house getting. Oh, like fumigate it. Yeah. Yeah. The three pyramids. That's cool.
[29:21.530 --> 29:26.570]  And the scarabs are out of control in this thing. We got to. Oh, my God. I was afraid of the scarabs.
[29:26.570 --> 29:34.670]  That was all from the movie. Oh, my God. Oh. Ouch. I just got to the pyramids in Indiana Jones.
[29:34.990 --> 29:39.090]  Pretty cool. Oh, I need to play. I'm I'm almost there, I think. I think I'm about to be at the pyramids.
[29:39.670 --> 29:47.610]  It's just let me know when you reach a like a very water heavy area.
[29:47.870 --> 29:53.270]  OK, I'm at the point now where I'm stopping the Zeppelin from from leaving or I jumped on the Zeppelin
[29:53.910 --> 29:58.330]  or maybe I took the Zeppelin to Giza. And now I don't remember. I'm doing some shit under a
[29:58.330 --> 30:05.890]  under a pyramid. Last episode, you talked about a film having like big gaps between shots because
[30:05.890 --> 30:10.510]  of Mission Impossible. Do you think we should do a Let's Play series where we play a video game,
[30:10.510 --> 30:24.330]  but do one level every year? Yes. What game? Oh, Lasso. Lasso. OK, that was that was the reverse
[30:24.330 --> 30:31.270]  of what typically happens. That was Nick speaking an idea into Gavin's brain as opposed to Nick
[30:31.270 --> 30:38.730]  copying whatever Gavin just siren. Yeah. Yeah. You guys are connected. We are one. Which Halo?
[30:38.730 --> 30:41.930]  Halo one. Is that what you said, Nick? Well, it'd have to be a four player one.
[30:42.310 --> 30:46.550]  Oh, yeah. I don't mind watching. I don't mind. I don't mind watching. Andrew's the best Halo
[30:46.550 --> 30:51.590]  player here. Everyone just kept saying yes. And now it's come down to, all right, what are we
[30:51.590 --> 30:54.690]  playing? And it's a bunch of people going, I don't want to play. I don't want to play. I don't
[30:54.690 --> 30:59.830]  really understand any of this, guys. I mean, I'll fucking play it. I just know that people want to
[30:59.830 --> 31:05.250]  play. We should do Halo 2 because that's the hardest. OK, yeah, that can be what you and Nick
[31:05.250 --> 31:14.990]  do. Oh, shit. We figured out what the Gavin and Nick show is. We play one level. Oh, that's 15
[31:14.990 --> 31:21.570]  levels, I think. Well, you got time to lock in. We'll be done by twenty thirty nine. The first
[31:21.570 --> 31:28.270]  level of Halo 2 lasso is so hard. Just in time to reflect on GTA five. And if it feels like
[31:28.270 --> 31:34.590]  it's if you start now, you can like sort of mirror like one to one one Soto's contract
[31:34.590 --> 31:41.270]  with New York. Do we want to put them out each year or wait until we're finished to put them out?
[31:42.210 --> 31:48.430]  I think each year. Yeah, I think each year we got to keep coming back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because
[31:48.430 --> 31:52.690]  you don't want to burn them. You know, you don't want to be in year seven and people go like, man,
[31:52.690 --> 31:56.490]  I can't wait until they do that thing. And it's like, oh, we forgot about that forever ago. You
[31:56.490 --> 32:00.910]  got to do it one a year. So everyone knows you're locked in. Yeah. Plus, you don't want to burn a
[32:00.910 --> 32:04.750]  decade and a half's worth of content in one year. It'd be ridiculous. Yeah, that would suck.
[32:05.210 --> 32:09.310]  You could start doing it now, like right before it's almost the end of the year. I think we should.
[32:09.370 --> 32:13.010]  I think we should have an agreement where if one of us dies before we finish, the other person has
[32:13.010 --> 32:21.390]  to keep going. Wow. Can they find a replacement? I mean, can't one of us fill in if Nick or you die?
[32:22.030 --> 32:27.550]  Went to Nick first. That was pretty interesting. Yeah, I think one of one of this crew can fill in.
[32:27.550 --> 32:32.330]  Okay. I mean, I went to Nick first. I was talking to Gavin. If I was talking to Nick,
[32:32.510 --> 32:36.890]  I was going to Gavin first. You don't want to project the person you're talking to is going to
[32:36.890 --> 32:43.090]  die first. I want to do this. And I really want to do. I keep thinking about the idea of a month
[32:43.090 --> 32:48.990]  long game of Mario Party. I want to do that so bad. Oh, yeah. The one turn every day. One turn
[32:48.990 --> 32:52.490]  every day. We'll have to find a month where everybody's available for the month
[32:52.970 --> 32:58.750]  and record one turn a day. I just want it to be a constant. I want it to be doing weekends.
[32:58.970 --> 33:04.070]  I would do it just for one. You got to do weekends. It's one turn. Otherwise, it's not
[33:04.070 --> 33:08.650]  going to be like seven minutes. I'll do it. We just need to find a month where it works.
[33:09.150 --> 33:14.450]  What's the most turns we can have? 30. I think it's 30. Yeah. Yeah. That seems that seems right
[33:14.450 --> 33:22.090]  to me. So is that a video every day or is it one video? Oh, I think I think it's should be one
[33:22.090 --> 33:26.530]  video. Yeah, one video. You think it's one video? I mean, it's great either way. It's great. Burn
[33:26.530 --> 33:31.730]  it through a month's worth of content and for one video. It could also be a video a day on the on
[33:31.730 --> 33:37.230]  the subreddit on the subreddit on the Patreon, and then we can compile it all and put it together
[33:37.230 --> 33:43.110]  and release it to the public later. It'd just be an editing thing of of like shooting and then
[33:43.110 --> 33:48.470]  uploading that like a one day turnaround. But I guess it's just seven minutes. What is the next
[33:48.470 --> 33:53.710]  month with 30 days? Hold on. February. No, January, February, March, April, I think.
[33:54.790 --> 34:00.850]  OK. Right. Because you go by my big knuckle, my little knuckle, big knuckle, little knuckle. Yeah,
[34:00.950 --> 34:07.870]  I just think it would be so fun to like to know that to go to sleep knowing that Gavin is three
[34:07.870 --> 34:14.430]  spaces away from a steal a star from being able to steal something. You could do it in March,
[34:14.870 --> 34:20.490]  days one through 30, and then on day 31, everyone knows the last day of March is when it comes out.
[34:22.910 --> 34:26.510]  Interesting. It'd be easy because you'd be building the file as you go.
[34:26.670 --> 34:30.690]  Right. And you only need one perspective. And then everyone's audio. Yeah, it's single screen.
[34:32.750 --> 34:36.170]  I'm happy with March or April. Yeah. All right. Let's do it.
[34:37.130 --> 34:42.330]  I think just even the podcast conversations around the idea of just having an ongoing game,
[34:42.330 --> 34:47.650]  I think it's fun. I think it's such a good idea, Andrew, that after we're done,
[34:47.670 --> 34:51.030]  we'll want to do it again immediately and we'll start searching for the next game to do it in.
[34:51.450 --> 34:55.010]  I think it might put us in a whole new paranoid era. I think you could be right.
[34:55.270 --> 34:59.550]  We're going to be we're definitely going to be sleeping on some grievances from day to day.
[35:04.090 --> 35:08.310]  There should be a prize. There should be a 30 day like you survived the Mario Party.
[35:08.310 --> 35:09.850]  $100 gift certificate.
[35:13.250 --> 35:20.650]  I put it on our calendar for February 28th to prepare for Mario Party month,
[35:20.730 --> 35:24.370]  which would be how many times do you think Geoff will drop out of the game?
[35:24.570 --> 35:32.270]  Zero, zero, because I zero because I bought a new a new one and I never even set up the
[35:32.270 --> 35:37.610]  Wi-Fi on it and I tested it and I played for hours and hours and hours and I've had no issues.
[35:37.610 --> 35:45.370]  It's going to be fine. What about your power? Well, I mean, what about your power, Nick?
[35:45.850 --> 35:49.730]  What about Eric's power? I'm not the only one with power problems.
[35:49.890 --> 35:53.530]  Have you guys seen Geoff's hardwire solution? No.
[35:54.130 --> 35:58.930]  OK, I took it down for the Christmas party. Is there a picture of it?
[35:59.530 --> 36:04.370]  No, no. Unless Eric took one. I did not take one. Geoff doesn't
[36:04.370 --> 36:09.470]  attempt to run the cable out of the way. It just goes through the middle of the room
[36:09.470 --> 36:13.090]  at about waist height. Yeah, yeah.
[36:13.510 --> 36:18.570]  And then it goes over the stairs and then down the stairs and then through the living room.
[36:18.870 --> 36:27.210]  Yes, it does. It is meant to be a tripping hazard 100%.
[36:27.210 --> 36:30.390]  I have a question. Why not do it on the outside?
[36:31.930 --> 36:35.090]  Of the house? Yeah, it's not my house, dude.
[36:35.250 --> 36:38.070]  I'm not going to drill a hole from the inside of this house to the outside of the house.
[36:38.230 --> 36:41.250]  Nah, just like put it out the window. Run like 200 feet of cable.
[36:41.450 --> 36:43.850]  Put it out the window, run it up the side, put it back in the other window.
[36:43.890 --> 36:45.890]  I don't think these windows open in this room.
[36:48.370 --> 36:53.090]  Once again, not my house. You don't have to own the house to open the window.
[36:53.810 --> 36:57.470]  I don't think this window opens. It's not an open window.
[36:57.630 --> 36:59.430]  And then also, fuck you. How about that?
[36:59.430 --> 37:05.330]  Listen, it doesn't affect you. All you need to know is that I'm hardwired in.
[37:05.530 --> 37:09.850]  Don't worry about how I'm hardwired in. I'm hardwired in.
[37:10.090 --> 37:13.270]  That's all you need to be concerned about. The how is where the company is.
[37:13.290 --> 37:17.250]  I don't want to draw. I don't have to have a fucking 350 foot ethernet cable to string
[37:17.250 --> 37:20.290]  it around the outside of this goddamn house to the other side of the house.
[37:20.790 --> 37:24.250]  That's fine. No, what's fine is stepping over the cable.
[37:24.510 --> 37:27.630]  That's totally fine. I have no issue doing that. It's my house. I live here.
[37:27.630 --> 37:29.850]  It doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother the dog.
[37:29.930 --> 37:33.070]  The dog is the thing I'm worried about the most.
[37:34.030 --> 37:36.770]  The dog at any moment is taking that whole setup down.
[37:36.870 --> 37:38.950]  No, he's very careful. He's very careful.
[37:39.190 --> 37:44.690]  No, he's not. We've been around him. He pisses when he gets excited.
[37:45.010 --> 37:47.150]  And he's a bowling ball that runs into Gavin.
[37:47.650 --> 37:52.210]  But he's lower than the cable. Except for my office. But he's not in my office.
[37:53.050 --> 37:58.750]  That's what it's guys. It was like it was shocking to me when I saw it.
[37:58.950 --> 38:01.530]  I just thought it would have been easier to be like about to film.
[38:01.590 --> 38:03.510]  Let me just pop the window open, grab the end of the cable.
[38:03.830 --> 38:09.250]  Oh, I'm finished. Just chuck it back out of the second floor of my house.
[38:09.930 --> 38:13.230]  Yeah, just have it on like a hook or something out there.
[38:13.430 --> 38:18.790]  Yeah. OK, well, I love these solutions for you.
[38:18.790 --> 38:26.010]  If you find yourself in a similar situation to the situation that I'm in,
[38:26.090 --> 38:30.030]  I think you're fucking set because you've got a lot of options to make you happy.
[38:30.090 --> 38:31.950]  I went with the option that makes me the happiest.
[38:31.950 --> 38:33.490]  And I'm pretty comfortable with that option.
[38:34.250 --> 38:36.690]  I thought the whole point was that Emily didn't like it.
[38:37.170 --> 38:40.210]  There's a lot of stuff that people don't. Not everybody likes everything all the time.
[38:40.570 --> 38:45.330]  People get the idea that we're supposed to be happy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
[38:45.410 --> 38:47.630]  We're not. Happiness is one of the emotions,
[38:47.630 --> 38:49.370]  but they're all valid emotions.
[38:49.570 --> 38:52.810]  If Emily's feeling some other kind of way about this cable,
[38:52.870 --> 38:55.630]  it's probably good that she has a little bit of that other emotion in her life
[38:55.630 --> 38:57.670]  because too much happiness isn't good for anybody.
[38:57.770 --> 38:58.870]  Then you don't appreciate anything.
[38:59.350 --> 39:01.530]  Andrew always yells at me when I'm like, oh, this thing's wrong.
[39:01.590 --> 39:02.570]  And then I have no solution.
[39:02.730 --> 39:05.350]  So in 2025, I'm trying to be more of a solutions guy.
[39:05.350 --> 39:07.090]  You're doing great. I'm with you, Gavin.
[39:07.210 --> 39:09.770]  I think you offered some fantastic solutions.
[39:09.770 --> 39:12.090]  I agree with you, you little dickheads.
[39:12.230 --> 39:14.290]  I said your solutions are awesome for you.
[39:14.290 --> 39:18.490]  I'm just going to go with the solution that works the best for Geoff,
[39:18.590 --> 39:23.990]  because unfortunately, no matter what I do about it, 49 years into it,
[39:24.010 --> 39:30.090]  I still got to get up and go to bed with Geoff every fucking day.
[39:30.570 --> 39:32.010]  Day in, day out.
[39:32.150 --> 39:34.370]  I get you guys get an hour of it here.
[39:34.470 --> 39:35.730]  You get three hours of it there.
[39:35.830 --> 39:39.210]  Maybe we hang out on a Sunday night at a party and then you go back to your lives.
[39:39.570 --> 39:41.450]  There's no leaving Geoff for Geoff.
[39:41.450 --> 39:45.690]  I'm here always in this body, in this brain,
[39:45.790 --> 39:48.870]  dealing with these thoughts and emotions and this nonsense.
[39:48.890 --> 39:52.550]  And so I can only do what's best for that fucking asshole,
[39:52.690 --> 39:54.630]  which seems to be the situation that we have.
[39:54.970 --> 39:56.910]  Do you ever dream that you're someone else?
[39:56.970 --> 39:58.190]  Yeah, but not when I'm asleep.
[39:58.290 --> 39:59.310]  Usually just when I'm awake.
[40:00.230 --> 40:02.150]  You're just fantasizing about like,
[40:02.370 --> 40:05.170]  man, I bet that I bet this other guy's a doctor.
[40:05.550 --> 40:08.130]  He's got cables that run the right way in his house.
[40:08.130 --> 40:09.990]  See that some guy walking on the street.
[40:10.090 --> 40:12.350]  I'm like, he's fucking he that dude.
[40:12.450 --> 40:16.250]  He doesn't have he that that dude doesn't have problems like I got.
[40:16.410 --> 40:17.250]  I wish I was that guy.
[40:17.310 --> 40:17.510]  Yeah.
[40:17.950 --> 40:20.850]  You still getting needles to the face for your jaw?
[40:21.810 --> 40:23.950]  I didn't I didn't get any needles this week.
[40:24.030 --> 40:25.930]  I just got some adjustments.
[40:26.570 --> 40:28.150]  And what does that mean?
[40:28.210 --> 40:29.130]  What does adjustments mean?
[40:29.550 --> 40:34.150]  Just like neck pops and cracks and scratches and yeah, all that stuff.
[40:34.290 --> 40:36.050]  Was it was it even for TMJ?
[40:36.050 --> 40:38.150]  It's all for TMJ, I think.
[40:38.730 --> 40:41.370]  And and just for my dog shit posture.
[40:42.270 --> 40:43.230]  Did it help?
[40:43.730 --> 40:46.430]  I mean, I'm fucking incredibly sore.
[40:46.930 --> 40:48.570]  I can barely walk.
[40:49.750 --> 40:52.750]  Is this kind of like Gavin offering solutions for your wires?
[40:54.870 --> 40:56.430]  Your solutions for your jaw.
[40:56.630 --> 40:58.290]  I'm going to break you in half.
[40:59.070 --> 41:03.930]  It's like it's I feel better in the sense that I feel like shit physically.
[41:07.150 --> 41:09.290]  And I'm told that's some kind of progress.
[41:09.430 --> 41:13.470]  So, you know, this is the most you thing I've ever heard.
[41:13.570 --> 41:16.030]  I don't know really what's wrong with me.
[41:16.110 --> 41:17.010]  It might be mental.
[41:17.010 --> 41:20.570]  So if I can make it physical, at least it matches.
[41:21.210 --> 41:23.150]  Well, it's nice to feel like you're doing work.
[41:23.430 --> 41:24.970]  The current the current.
[41:25.090 --> 41:26.070]  Yeah, it's nice to feel like you're doing work.
[41:26.190 --> 41:27.270]  I had a CAT scan.
[41:27.630 --> 41:30.490]  I went to see I saw a couple of different doctors.
[41:30.490 --> 41:39.210]  The current thought is that it's either TMJ, which is onset by extreme stress.
[41:39.730 --> 41:41.030]  I don't know where that could come from.
[41:42.690 --> 41:47.130]  Or the hardware from my previous surgery might have some issues.
[41:47.350 --> 41:49.910]  And if it does, I need to go see an oral surgeon.
[41:50.270 --> 41:54.230]  I'm going to see my dentist on Monday to get the final answer.
[41:54.590 --> 41:57.430]  I'll be off my antibiotics by my second round of antibiotics by then.
[41:57.450 --> 42:00.290]  And then we'll make the determination if I need to go see an oral surgeon or not.
[42:00.290 --> 42:04.650]  If I do, it's possible that some of the screws in my mouth may have backed out a little bit
[42:04.650 --> 42:08.270]  and that's like some infection got in there or something or who knows what.
[42:08.350 --> 42:14.430]  But I'm really fucking hoping that I don't end up having to go under the knife for this.
[42:14.590 --> 42:16.430]  I hope it's just TMJ.
[42:16.730 --> 42:21.810]  Maybe you will take a hot dog to the face tomorrow and it'll just fix everything.
[42:22.490 --> 42:23.810]  Dude, that would be fucking great.
[42:24.150 --> 42:25.610]  It just snaps you out of it.
[42:26.210 --> 42:28.970]  Like Randy Quaid's kid in Christmas Vacation
[42:30.210 --> 42:32.890]  was cross-eyed and then got kicked by a mule and suddenly could see straight again.
[42:35.490 --> 42:37.450]  I remember watching a thing on TV as a kid.
[42:37.510 --> 42:41.050]  There was a woman who, she must have been in her 20s or something, but she couldn't talk.
[42:41.630 --> 42:44.270]  And then one day she just like coughed up a coin.
[42:44.990 --> 42:47.290]  And they realized that she'd swallowed it as a kid and no one noticed.
[42:48.010 --> 42:48.670]  Did it come up heads?
[43:03.090 --> 43:07.700]  Oh, that was so quick.
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.800]  Guess who's not walking around the snowy wilderness of GTA?
[43:14.760 --> 43:16.080]  Someone's locked in.
[43:16.780 --> 43:17.040]  Wow.
[43:17.340 --> 43:23.060]  I had someone in my family who was born completely deaf in one ear and like had barely any hearing
[43:23.060 --> 43:23.720]  in the other ear.
[43:24.040 --> 43:29.620]  And because they couldn't hear things, their brain would create sounds.
[43:29.620 --> 43:36.140]  So like they complain later in life about hearing orchestral music constantly that they hated.
[43:36.300 --> 43:38.420]  And this was a problem that went on for a long time.
[43:38.600 --> 43:46.020]  And then one evening they miscalculated how low to the toilet they were and they fell
[43:46.020 --> 43:49.280]  into the toilet and it fixed the problem.
[43:49.420 --> 43:50.200]  It never happened again.
[43:50.380 --> 43:50.980]  What do you mean?
[43:52.980 --> 43:55.060]  What part of the story are you confused by?
[43:55.060 --> 43:56.860]  What is falling into the toilet mean?
[43:56.920 --> 44:01.340]  Like like sitting down and fell in and dunked your butt in your balls or vag or whatever.
[44:01.440 --> 44:05.540]  OK, so so like they thought they were going to sit on this like they were about to sit
[44:05.540 --> 44:06.000]  on the seat.
[44:06.200 --> 44:07.920]  It was like they woke up in the night to sit.
[44:08.220 --> 44:09.740]  They miscalculated.
[44:09.860 --> 44:12.700]  And so they fell a little bit onto the seat.
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.320]  Like it wasn't just like they they they naturally transitioned to it.
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.020]  There was a little bit of a like a book.
[44:19.920 --> 44:24.000]  And in that impact, it fixed whatever was going on.
[44:24.000 --> 44:24.920]  So the music went away.
[44:25.180 --> 44:26.920]  The music went away, never came back.
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.160]  So I have a question for you.
[44:28.580 --> 44:28.700]  Yeah.
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.260]  Did they know in the moment that this had happened or was it a realization that came
[44:34.260 --> 44:36.280]  later and they were like, oh, the music's gone?
[44:36.440 --> 44:37.780]  Well, what could it have been?
[44:37.940 --> 44:39.860]  The only the only thing that happened was I fell in the toilet.
[44:40.240 --> 44:41.100]  No, I think it was in the moment.
[44:41.500 --> 44:44.020]  Oh, so like the music was playing and they could hear it.
[44:44.400 --> 44:50.640]  And then they they hit and they had the thud and then it stopped and it never happened again.
[44:50.740 --> 44:52.560]  So after that, they never heard anything ever again.
[44:52.560 --> 44:54.420]  Never heard anything ever again.
[44:55.100 --> 44:55.540]  Wow.
[44:55.720 --> 44:56.580]  Went away after that.
[44:56.740 --> 44:59.480]  I like that the only thing they could hear was annoying.
[45:00.180 --> 45:00.620]  Wow.
[45:01.380 --> 45:04.460]  Well, they weren't a fan of music, so I guess any sound.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.700]  Did they want were they once able to hear?
[45:07.480 --> 45:09.680]  They could hear, but like not great.
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.920]  So like they had 10% hearing in one ear and then the other ear, nothing.
[45:15.320 --> 45:17.760]  Do they say seeds or kernels?
[45:17.960 --> 45:19.740]  That I can't ask, unfortunately.
[45:19.740 --> 45:22.640]  Oh, did you get any more texts back?
[45:22.740 --> 45:23.380]  Did you text anyone?
[45:23.700 --> 45:26.040]  I did, and I didn't bring it up because it wasn't helpful.
[45:26.940 --> 45:31.240]  OK, now when you're saying it wasn't helpful, does that mean that it wasn't?
[45:31.480 --> 45:32.580]  No, it went against me further.
[45:32.840 --> 45:34.520]  Yeah, that's why I didn't bring it up.
[45:34.780 --> 45:36.460]  I don't talk about it if you ask.
[45:36.700 --> 45:39.880]  I'm not hiding from it, but I'm not going to willfully give the information.
[45:40.360 --> 45:44.980]  Now, now, if you are withholding information that proves us right,
[45:45.340 --> 45:47.460]  you think you're not hiding information?
[45:47.840 --> 45:48.960]  Withholding is a strong word.
[45:48.960 --> 45:51.720]  I'm going to give you the information as soon as you ask for it.
[45:51.740 --> 45:54.580]  I'm just not going to declare there's been an update.
[45:54.840 --> 45:56.760]  But we were all excited about the update.
[45:57.460 --> 45:59.860]  Well, I so I texted any other names.
[46:00.040 --> 46:02.900]  He's not even going to play.
[46:02.980 --> 46:04.000]  He's not going to talk about it.
[46:04.140 --> 46:04.880]  He's just going to go.
[46:04.900 --> 46:06.180]  Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
[46:08.220 --> 46:09.640]  No, I'm talking about it right now.
[46:09.700 --> 46:12.340]  I said any other names and they replied.
[46:13.040 --> 46:16.260]  There are unpopped kernels, oil and seasoning.
[46:16.260 --> 46:22.280]  So they just further elaborated what was in the bag of microwavable popcorn.
[46:22.920 --> 46:23.800]  No seeds.
[46:24.920 --> 46:26.080]  Real lack of seeds.
[46:26.280 --> 46:27.540]  Would an egg be a chicken seed?
[46:28.200 --> 46:30.180]  An egg be a chicken seed?
[46:30.960 --> 46:31.840]  I guess.
[46:31.880 --> 46:33.220]  Yeah, I guess technically.
[46:34.080 --> 46:36.060]  Are you surprised you can't eat the jizz of a chicken?
[46:36.980 --> 46:37.620]  Can you not?
[46:37.800 --> 46:38.020]  Why can't you?
[46:40.320 --> 46:40.800]  Why?
[46:41.100 --> 46:44.240]  Now, I've never thought about this once in my life.
[46:44.240 --> 46:48.500]  And I'm, you know, I'm up there in terms of years on Earth.
[46:49.840 --> 46:51.460]  What made you think of this?
[46:51.580 --> 46:53.200]  And what the fuck are you talking about?
[46:53.260 --> 46:56.300]  Just the chicken is so used, like they used the shit out of the chicken.
[46:57.320 --> 46:58.080]  I see.
[46:58.480 --> 47:00.020]  For all kinds of different purposes.
[47:00.200 --> 47:01.680]  But I think the jizz is left alone.
[47:02.180 --> 47:04.020]  Do you think chicken semen tastes like chicken?
[47:04.760 --> 47:05.700]  If it was fried?
[47:07.180 --> 47:07.700]  I don't know.
[47:07.900 --> 47:10.280]  Boy, do I have a new show idea for you.
[47:11.900 --> 47:13.060]  Tastes like chicken.
[47:15.860 --> 47:17.760]  Oh, here we go.
[47:18.020 --> 47:22.500]  The chicken mating process, the cloacal kiss.
[47:22.960 --> 47:26.040]  A rooster often employs a type of foreplay
[47:26.040 --> 47:29.060]  by prancing around the hen and clucking before mounting her.
[47:29.580 --> 47:32.700]  The transform of sperm happens quickly, like with you, Gavin,
[47:33.100 --> 47:36.440]  without the penetration normal in mammal mating.
[47:36.960 --> 47:41.380]  The cloaca or vent of the male and female touch and sperm are exchanged.
[47:41.520 --> 47:42.440]  This is more of a rub.
[47:43.140 --> 47:43.700]  Oh, okay.
[47:44.860 --> 47:45.260]  Hmm.
[47:46.780 --> 47:49.440]  It's like Avatar when they cross.
[47:49.820 --> 47:56.220]  Gavin saw an illustration of what Geoff just described and then was sad?
[47:57.260 --> 48:01.660]  Uh, no, I'm just, I just realized there's a bunch of shit that I've never had of a chicken.
[48:02.580 --> 48:03.180]  Like the testicles?
[48:03.180 --> 48:04.240]  Like the testicles?
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.240]  Yeah, the cloaca.
[48:06.600 --> 48:08.060]  Maybe it's not as used as I thought.
[48:10.660 --> 48:11.880]  I mean, it's pretty used.
[48:12.480 --> 48:13.400]  You could go buy one.
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.860]  It would be interesting to see...
[48:15.640 --> 48:17.380]  That would be like a horrible game.
[48:17.700 --> 48:20.240]  Maybe like a game for farmers, where you just look at a bucket
[48:20.240 --> 48:24.300]  and see all the stuff that isn't used, and you have to try and guess what animal it is.
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.860]  I think you should go to a grocery store and have somebody who works there
[48:30.860 --> 48:35.740]  ask them in front of the roast chickens, do you have these with balls?
[48:36.420 --> 48:38.320]  Do you have testicle ones of these?
[48:39.640 --> 48:43.320]  Because I keep buying these and the testicles aren't with them any time.
[48:43.440 --> 48:44.320]  I think this is some bullshit.
[48:44.320 --> 48:46.160]  But if I went up to someone in front of a bunch of chickens,
[48:46.340 --> 48:48.240]  and I said, do you have the testicle ones of these?
[48:48.340 --> 48:49.800]  They'd just be like, a rooster?
[48:50.800 --> 48:52.980]  Yeah, you could say, have these been de-testicled?
[48:55.760 --> 48:57.220]  Why'd you give me a French picture?
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.520]  That's just what it was.
[49:00.240 --> 49:05.320]  That was the image that was there when I searched chicken sperm or whatever.
[49:05.680 --> 49:07.440]  Because I'm learning about the cock in the pool.
[49:07.440 --> 49:07.980]  Yeah.
[49:11.700 --> 49:13.360]  No, that's... oh wait, is that what it said?
[49:13.460 --> 49:14.800]  I thought it was saying the rooster's the cock.
[49:15.760 --> 49:16.820]  Oh, I'm an idiot.
[49:18.120 --> 49:18.820]  What the fuck?
[49:18.820 --> 49:19.920]  Nick thought the neck was...
[49:21.260 --> 49:24.340]  Nick thought the neck was called the cock because it's really the neck.
[49:24.840 --> 49:26.100]  Oh man, I hurt my cock.
[49:28.300 --> 49:29.360]  That's what you took from what?
[49:29.360 --> 49:30.420]  All the popping of my cock.
[49:33.200 --> 49:33.880]  You know what?
[49:34.360 --> 49:34.940]  What is...
[49:34.940 --> 49:36.900]  Oh, I'm gonna wring your cock.
[49:38.480 --> 49:39.920]  That's my corn seed moment.
[49:42.580 --> 49:44.280]  I mean, maybe it is French for neck.
[49:44.360 --> 49:44.680]  I don't know.
[49:44.800 --> 49:46.720]  I just guessed it was talking about the rooster.
[49:47.520 --> 49:47.980]  Oh, maybe.
[49:48.180 --> 49:48.700]  Hold on, let's look.
[49:51.020 --> 49:53.480]  No, unfortunately, French for neck is cou.
[49:53.660 --> 49:54.440]  C-O-U.
[49:54.580 --> 49:55.200]  Was close.
[49:56.020 --> 49:56.620]  That is pretty close.
[49:56.740 --> 49:57.280]  It is.
[49:57.400 --> 49:59.260]  You know, some words are close to other words.
[49:59.400 --> 50:02.040]  So a cuckoo is a rooster neck.
[50:08.680 --> 50:12.300]  That should be the name of the new company, Rooster Neck.
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.460]  Yeah, this is starting to sound oddly familiar to a previous conversation I had once 23 years ago.
[50:20.400 --> 50:24.180]  I had a video game milestone this week.
[50:24.480 --> 50:26.860]  Something I've never done before in a video game I'm very excited about.
[50:27.820 --> 50:29.720]  It's fucking dumb, but I did it.
[50:29.940 --> 50:31.580]  You golded every weapon.
[50:32.140 --> 50:35.900]  Not every weapon, but I golded enough weapons to unlock Diamond.
[50:35.900 --> 50:38.980]  I have my first Diamond skin in a Call of Duty game.
[50:39.860 --> 50:40.180]  Thank you.
[50:40.400 --> 50:41.180]  You've been working on that.
[50:41.540 --> 50:45.560]  Yeah, it took me... well, I mean, I had vacations in between and stuff,
[50:45.620 --> 50:46.760]  so I wasn't here the whole time.
[50:46.840 --> 50:49.980]  But yeah, it took me probably a better part of a month to do,
[50:50.280 --> 50:51.640]  being out of town at least a week of that.
[50:52.380 --> 50:54.800]  And it's amazing how much better you get at Call of Duty.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.900]  The first, because you basically have to take it to gold and then do like four other skins
[50:58.900 --> 51:00.600]  after that, and then it gets you two Diamond.
[51:00.860 --> 51:04.820]  And then you can't unlock Diamond until you have seven of those.
[51:04.820 --> 51:10.100]  The first one probably took me a week, and the last one I did in an evening easily.
[51:10.600 --> 51:10.920]  Oh, wow.
[51:11.120 --> 51:13.840]  And it's amazing how much faster it goes as you get better at the game.
[51:14.320 --> 51:15.460]  That's awesome, man. Good job.
[51:15.800 --> 51:16.620]  Yeah, thanks. I'm excited.
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.280]  I guess I could go for whatever's next,
[51:18.380 --> 51:22.280]  but I think the next one requires me to gold 33 guns.
[51:22.760 --> 51:23.280]  Oh, wow.
[51:23.420 --> 51:26.020]  And I've only done seven, so I don't know about that.
[51:26.220 --> 51:28.360]  Jeez. I'm excited for more zombies.
[51:29.180 --> 51:31.940]  Like, I don't think they've even announced more zombie stuff,
[51:32.060 --> 51:34.200]  but I had so much fun playing that.
[51:34.200 --> 51:35.960]  Yeah, the whole thing is fun.
[51:36.180 --> 51:38.420]  I played a little bit of Warzone for the first time last night,
[51:38.680 --> 51:40.080]  and that was fucking great.
[51:40.460 --> 51:41.640]  I really enjoyed it.
[51:42.700 --> 51:44.820]  I'm a pretty pro Call of Duty right now.
[51:45.140 --> 51:45.680]  Yeah, it's great.
[51:46.000 --> 51:46.680]  It's a really fun one.
[51:47.020 --> 51:52.000]  Hey, we, Eric and, or not Eric, Nick and Andrew,
[51:52.320 --> 51:57.200]  we came up with an idea the other day that I feel like we should talk about.
[51:57.620 --> 52:00.900]  Now, is this idea, just before you expand,
[52:00.900 --> 52:06.800]  I noticed Eric posted you guys were hanging out and the idea was called It Follows.
[52:06.860 --> 52:08.040]  Is that the idea?
[52:08.720 --> 52:09.740]  What was the idea called?
[52:10.380 --> 52:11.400]  It Follows?
[52:11.620 --> 52:13.340]  That's not exactly what it was called, but it's close.
[52:13.600 --> 52:15.660]  That is not what the idea is called.
[52:15.940 --> 52:16.740]  What was it called?
[52:17.920 --> 52:18.580]  You go look.
[52:18.720 --> 52:19.680]  Eric named it.
[52:20.300 --> 52:24.400]  The idea is called Idea It Follows.
[52:25.220 --> 52:26.360]  Idea It Follows.
[52:26.360 --> 52:31.620]  We were at the Salon Christmas Party and we were just shooting the shit.
[52:31.760 --> 52:34.520]  And we were coming up with a different idea that I think we all liked that I completely
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.080]  forgot because we got on this idea.
[52:37.720 --> 52:42.520]  And it's essentially a new game we can play that I think you guys are going to be very
[52:42.520 --> 52:43.280]  excited about.
[52:43.380 --> 52:44.880]  And I think Gavin was going to play it first.
[52:44.960 --> 52:47.040]  Gavin, do you do you want to play it today?
[52:47.100 --> 52:49.360]  And if so, would you like to?
[52:49.480 --> 52:50.640]  Wait, why was I playing it first?
[52:51.540 --> 52:52.120]  I don't know.
[52:52.120 --> 52:54.400]  Because we we said that you because we talked about it tonight.
[52:54.400 --> 52:57.820]  We said, like, either you or you or Eric should play it first.
[52:58.060 --> 53:01.100]  I thought they don't know it's coming.
[53:01.760 --> 53:03.220]  You have to do that, dude.
[53:03.280 --> 53:04.540]  That's what playing it is.
[53:05.280 --> 53:08.100]  Hey, Andrew and Nick, here's what the idea is.
[53:08.280 --> 53:09.440]  Jesus Christ.
[53:11.660 --> 53:17.340]  The idea is that the power, this power is bestowed upon one person to start.
[53:17.780 --> 53:24.260]  At any point, they can say they can pick one of the other four of us and say, like,
[53:24.260 --> 53:28.780]  for example, what we had talked about was Gavin having the power and then saying,
[53:28.900 --> 53:36.300]  OK, Nick, tomorrow at 10 a.m., whatever your idea is, that's what we're doing.
[53:36.680 --> 53:37.520]  Have it ready.
[53:37.620 --> 53:38.440]  We're filming at 10.
[53:38.740 --> 53:39.000]  Yep.
[53:39.220 --> 53:45.840]  And so tomorrow, so when it's called tomorrow at 10 a.m., we will be doing that idea.
[53:46.080 --> 53:50.840]  Then that power now belongs to Nick after we do his idea and everything.
[53:50.840 --> 53:57.180]  Nick now has that power and can use it whenever he wants on any of the other four of us.
[53:57.280 --> 53:58.820]  So he can do it right back to Gavin.
[53:59.040 --> 54:01.940]  But I don't think that's fun, but could be.
[54:02.020 --> 54:02.380]  Who knows?
[54:02.740 --> 54:05.960]  Or he can wait six months and shoot it at Eric when he's not looking.
[54:06.740 --> 54:11.720]  And so at all times, the idea, it follows every one of us around.
[54:11.900 --> 54:16.560]  And you should have something locked and loaded that we could do the next day at 10 a.m.
[54:17.040 --> 54:22.380]  That was the idea of like, OK, so out of nowhere, what is the thing we're doing?
[54:22.460 --> 54:24.460]  And we want to see if it spawns anything.
[54:24.800 --> 54:28.040]  I think like really bad ideas that are hilarious to film.
[54:28.180 --> 54:30.900]  And I really love the name because it sounds like idiot follows.
[54:31.240 --> 54:34.120]  And I was a big fan of that.
[54:35.320 --> 54:38.960]  Yeah, as Eric was describing it and I was like, oh, it's kind of like it follows.
[54:39.020 --> 54:40.580]  And then Eric was like, idea, it follows.
[54:40.660 --> 54:41.000]  That's perfect.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.680]  And then, yeah, idiot follows.
[54:42.900 --> 54:45.040]  So that's that's the idea.
[54:45.040 --> 54:50.120]  I really like, OK, this time tomorrow we're doing this thing.
[54:50.240 --> 54:54.480]  Obviously, we have to be able to like schedule around it and everything if it's fucked up.
[54:54.880 --> 55:00.740]  But yeah, but I think the spirit of you got you better figure something out now because
[55:00.740 --> 55:02.340]  we're doing it tomorrow is a lot of fun.
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.360]  The idea is to keep people on their toes and also hopefully to catch somebody off their
[55:07.360 --> 55:08.300]  toes once or twice.
[55:08.700 --> 55:11.900]  But but we thought that Gavin should be the one to start with the power.
[55:12.120 --> 55:13.960]  I don't remember why now, but it was a part of the conversation.
[55:13.960 --> 55:15.160]  Gavin clearly doesn't remember either.
[55:15.520 --> 55:19.960]  So if nobody has an issue with it, Gavin, you are you have the initial power so you
[55:19.960 --> 55:23.680]  can use it whenever you want to from this point on, unless somebody has an issue with
[55:23.680 --> 55:23.880]  that.
[55:24.180 --> 55:24.340]  All right.
[55:24.360 --> 55:25.180]  The bullets in the gun.
[55:27.420 --> 55:29.140]  OK, shoot yourself with it.
[55:30.660 --> 55:32.220]  That would be insane.
[55:32.660 --> 55:33.900]  Then it's just over.
[55:34.140 --> 55:35.500]  Like, that's like the end of it.
[55:36.100 --> 55:38.080]  No, then you'd have to come up with an idea by 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[55:38.300 --> 55:38.940]  Oh, man.
[55:39.400 --> 55:40.860]  That's just blindside, isn't it?
[55:42.360 --> 55:43.020]  Blindside yourself.
[55:46.800 --> 55:49.340]  I think that's maybe that's how we started.
[55:49.480 --> 55:53.020]  I don't remember how exactly we started talking about it, but this feels like a thing where
[55:53.020 --> 55:55.900]  you're blindsiding someone else to have to make a blindside.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.220]  But we all know it's coming.
[55:58.620 --> 56:03.820]  I also just realized I blew my idea because we were talking about this and I got really
[56:03.820 --> 56:07.060]  scared and I thought in the moment I need to come up with an idea and I came up with the
[56:07.060 --> 56:08.380]  spitting the hot dogs on the fan.
[56:08.620 --> 56:10.460]  And I guess I forgot that that was my reserve idea.
[56:10.600 --> 56:11.400]  That was your.
[56:11.820 --> 56:12.260]  Oh, man.
[56:12.260 --> 56:14.460]  Yeah, I guess I got too excited.
[56:15.300 --> 56:16.080]  You're lucky, buddy.
[56:16.220 --> 56:19.520]  You've got all you had all the time in the world because you're that you're in control
[56:19.520 --> 56:20.000]  of the gun.
[56:20.100 --> 56:20.880]  That's true.
[56:23.790 --> 56:24.190]  Bye.
[56:29.830 --> 56:30.630]  Absolutely not.
[56:33.590 --> 56:36.570]  I thought it might go somewhere more than that's true, but OK.
[56:40.110 --> 56:43.130]  Honestly, I've been laughing so much this episode I've got I got real bad.
[56:44.670 --> 56:45.570]  It's a shit.
[56:45.850 --> 56:47.430]  No, I just got my heartburn again.
[56:49.650 --> 56:51.950]  How do you have heartburn from laughing?
[56:52.290 --> 56:52.810]  I don't know.
[56:52.870 --> 56:53.460]  I've got like.
[56:54.390 --> 56:56.770]  I guess some sort of acid problem.
[56:56.990 --> 56:57.730]  I don't know.
[56:58.030 --> 56:58.530]  Acid?
[56:59.050 --> 57:03.470]  I was just laughing earlier and now my chest hurts.
[57:03.710 --> 57:05.130]  Is that a thing that you've always had?
[57:05.450 --> 57:08.030]  No, no, pretty recent.
[57:12.390 --> 57:13.610]  It's probably TMJ.
[57:14.170 --> 57:14.530]  Probably.
[57:15.390 --> 57:17.670]  Maybe I'll get a chiropractic adjustment.
[57:18.210 --> 57:20.970]  We're getting pretty close to wrapping this bad boy up.
[57:21.090 --> 57:24.570]  But before we do, I wanted to enlist your help if you don't mind.
[57:25.230 --> 57:27.110]  I was looking at stuff I want to do in 2025.
[57:27.450 --> 57:30.930]  One of the ideas that I'm most excited about personally was doing that GeoGuessr
[57:30.930 --> 57:33.570]  bingo game because, you know, I'm a sloppy guy.
[57:34.930 --> 57:37.110]  And I was wondering if you guys would help me come up with prompts.
[57:37.230 --> 57:40.490]  We don't have to do it in episode, but just like I'll give you an idea of what I have.
[57:40.890 --> 57:42.110]  This is what I've written down so far.
[57:42.730 --> 57:49.270]  Uh, a flyer on a street pole or, you know, like anything furniture sale or whatever.
[57:49.410 --> 57:57.790]  A puncture, appliance outside, a car on blocks, a stop sign, a dog, a person crossing a street,
[57:57.870 --> 58:00.990]  a trash can, a McDonald's, a green car.
[58:01.670 --> 58:03.030]  I looked this up.
[58:03.250 --> 58:08.970]  Do you guys know what what what store has the most branches in America?
[58:09.930 --> 58:10.350]  Subway?
[58:11.210 --> 58:12.290]  No, it's nothing.
[58:13.810 --> 58:14.210]  Walmart?
[58:15.130 --> 58:16.030]  Not even close.
[58:17.290 --> 58:19.170]  No, it's Dollar General.
[58:19.510 --> 58:22.410]  There are $20,000 Generals in America.
[58:22.750 --> 58:24.690]  So I figured a Dollar General would be a good one.
[58:24.810 --> 58:26.150]  There's 12,711.
[58:26.310 --> 58:27.010]  So that would be a good one.
[58:27.090 --> 58:28.530]  There's 17,000 Starbucks.
[58:28.750 --> 58:29.410]  That would be a good one.
[58:29.650 --> 58:33.430]  A swimming pool, somebody with a backpack and some form of sports field.
[58:33.450 --> 58:34.630]  That's what I've written down so far.
[58:34.670 --> 58:39.170]  So that's just kind of like things that you might see if you, you know, geo dropped into a location.
[58:39.170 --> 58:40.790]  So just have that in the back of your head.
[58:40.870 --> 58:42.570]  And if anything comes to mind, please, we need it.
[58:42.610 --> 58:45.130]  We probably need a good 60 to 70 of them.
[58:45.170 --> 58:46.170]  Just to confirm.
[58:46.270 --> 58:48.110]  It's like we're on Google Street View, essentially.
[58:48.270 --> 58:49.010]  It's like, yeah, yeah.
[58:49.010 --> 58:50.450]  It's dropping in on Google Street View.
[58:50.570 --> 58:53.630]  And then you do a 360 around you and then pull back out and go to another one.
[58:53.950 --> 58:56.450]  You know how they blur out people's faces on that?
[58:57.030 --> 58:57.170]  Yeah.
[58:57.450 --> 58:58.750]  Do they blur out dogs faces?
[58:59.070 --> 58:59.870]  I don't think so.
[59:00.390 --> 59:02.110]  I don't think dogs have any right to privacy.
[59:02.230 --> 59:04.210]  And I'm not saying that's fair or right.
[59:04.210 --> 59:05.450]  I just think that that's where we are.
[59:05.830 --> 59:06.590]  I'm for it.
[59:06.630 --> 59:07.930]  I think I don't think dogs should be.
[59:07.930 --> 59:10.830]  I don't think dogs should be allowed to be private at all.
[59:13.010 --> 59:14.630]  So it's just a spin, Geoff.
[59:14.670 --> 59:17.390]  There's not like you can move up and down the street at all.
[59:17.490 --> 59:19.330]  No, I think it's got to be just the spin.
[59:19.610 --> 59:20.050]  You can do it.
[59:20.070 --> 59:24.270]  You drop down and wherever you are, you do a slow or fast pan 360 around.
[59:24.630 --> 59:25.350]  See what you see.
[59:25.410 --> 59:26.930]  And then you pull out and you go somewhere else.
[59:27.130 --> 59:31.530]  I was going to suggest if you had movement, it always takes me off guard
[59:31.530 --> 59:34.030]  where I'm going down a street and then all of a sudden,
[59:34.090 --> 59:36.090]  it's very clearly a completely different day.
[59:36.090 --> 59:41.610]  Like they updated midway through the street and it's now like way sunnier
[59:41.610 --> 59:45.530]  and it looks nothing like it was a foot prior to that.
[59:46.090 --> 59:46.590]  Oh, yeah.
[59:47.030 --> 59:49.190]  But OK, that'd be fun to come with prompts for that.
[59:49.490 --> 59:51.470]  Yeah, I just think you might see.
[59:51.610 --> 59:52.450]  I think we probably need a guy.
[59:52.550 --> 59:52.790]  I don't remember.
[59:52.870 --> 59:53.830]  I don't remember.
[59:53.890 --> 59:58.070]  But I think if we had like 65 total, I think that's enough for a bingo board.
[59:58.430 --> 59:59.870]  It's about what I did for the original.
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:02.710]  I think I did 62 originally for Sloppy Joe's.
[01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:06.270]  I think we can enlist the audience audience as well.
[01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.450]  Yeah, I think because I think they're going to come up with some really creative ones.
[01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:13.270]  I've just been like writing down what I see or notice that
[01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:18.350]  appears multiple times on that It's Shitty TikTok channel I like.
[01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.050]  But yeah, I'm sure the audience will have a ton of great ideas, I'm sure.
[01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:24.890]  I want to see someone falling over.
[01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:26.790]  Yeah, fucking hell.
[01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:27.530]  Yeah, I'll put it on the board.
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.330]  Someone falling, tripping, falling.
[01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:30.790]  I think, yeah.
[01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.810]  What else?
[01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:35.850]  I don't think I've ever seen it be funny to see someone like flipping off the truck.
[01:00:36.250 --> 01:00:36.990]  Oh, sure.
[01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:37.630]  Flipping off.
[01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.250]  I feel like I've seen like images of that on Reddit and stuff.
[01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.390]  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:46.330]  Gavin, how do you feel about having the gun?
[01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:48.050]  The idea gun?
[01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:49.590]  It's nice.
[01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:54.330]  It's nice to have the start of something ready to go.
[01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:03.270]  And so, OK, so to just I want to make sure I fully understand this idea.
[01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:07.030]  So Gavin could say, like, Nick, 10 a.m. tomorrow.
[01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.790]  Do we all show up for that recording?
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.690]  Or does that?
[01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.150]  Nick has an idea for all of us.
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.650]  Yeah, we don't have to participate in it.
[01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:17.390]  It could be a three player video game, but everybody's got to comment or whatever.
[01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:18.470]  It could be a video game.
[01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.670]  It could be a live in-person thing.
[01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.810]  It could be bingo.
[01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.750]  It could be whatever.
[01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.110]  But it has to be an idea that that's going to be some supplemental content.
[01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.910]  Yeah, great.
[01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:27.030]  Love it.
[01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:28.030]  That's gonna be so much fun.
[01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:31.690]  It could be that show where you and I read the local paper and eat the pie or whatever.
[01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:32.670]  Yeah, it could be great.
[01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:33.630]  Could be literally any idea.
[01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.190]  Yep.
[01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:40.170]  I cannot wait for one year from now to see what comes of idea it follows.
[01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:47.230]  Yeah, I like I think that was it's the thing of we're so bad of like following on like
[01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.430]  a bunch of threads and having stuff come out timely.
[01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:56.630]  This is a like such a focused fire of, OK, what's the idea?
[01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:58.570]  OK, we're doing it right now.
[01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.870]  OK, it can come out like we just put it out like that.
[01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.150]  That is it's very, very easy, very, very fast.
[01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:07.990]  It'll force us to talk about an idea and then immediately release it.
[01:02:08.370 --> 01:02:08.530]  Yep.
[01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:13.130]  I think we should at this point have a doc that just has all of our running bits.
[01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:15.350]  So we don't forget any.
[01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:16.950]  Sounds great.
[01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.830]  Let me know when you get it going.
[01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:18.350]  Yeah.
[01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:19.270]  Invite me.
[01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:20.310]  Share that with you.
[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:22.430]  If you want to just send it to all of our emails, man, that'd be great.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:25.210]  Well, I'd be like a producer role sort of.
[01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:27.070]  I'm just saying is a wee thing.
[01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:31.850]  And as as clear as the person who's in charge of all the docs.
[01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:33.430]  Yes.
[01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:34.050]  Yeah.
[01:02:34.090 --> 01:02:36.970]  So anytime you want to get that going, get some ideas down, then I can.
[01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.070]  Yeah, I can.
[01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.550]  We can all have a look over it all together.
[01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:46.090]  Well, we're talking about just to make note of because I keep forgetting and then remembering,
[01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:48.410]  forgetting, and I really want to see this content.
[01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:52.550]  We still have to release the Snake Eyes tuxedo unboxing.
[01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:53.790]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:58.270]  And I also would still really like to hear the podcast that Eric and Geoff recorded.
[01:02:58.550 --> 01:02:59.070]  Vinyl shopping.
[01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:01.290]  How about that, too?
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:02.710]  Nah, you don't need that one.
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:05.910]  That one might not be the funniest thing about that one is me farting on Eric, but.
[01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.210]  Yeah, it's it's it's really just sort of like,
[01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.530]  yeah, this did this meandered and didn't really I don't know that anyone's really going to care
[01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.890]  about it.
[01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:16.070]  Well, I don't think either of us was super blown away by it in the moment after we
[01:03:16.070 --> 01:03:17.050]  did it. We were both like, eh.
[01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.730]  I mean, now that I know there's a fart in there.
[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:26.310]  Because I feel like of all of us on this podcast, Eric would like to be farted on the least.
[01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:27.430]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:30.970]  Yeah, yeah, I would. I would. Yeah, I'd plant that flag for me. I agree.
[01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:32.730]  He didn't seem jazzed.
[01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:38.550]  No, but let's so so I so now we know I like it the least. Who likes it the most?
[01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.870]  Well, I've definitely had the most, but I wouldn't say I like it the most.
[01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:45.370]  I'll probably take it. That's fine.
[01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:51.510]  I mean, are you allowed to sell a fart at a jar?
[01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:54.770]  Yeah. Yeah, why not? I think people have done that before.
[01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:58.310]  Didn't didn't didn't some girl do that on OnlyFans or something?
[01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.610]  I think so, like water.
[01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.950]  But what if you what if you farted in a balloon?
[01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:13.550]  What if you filled a balloon with fart and then put that balloon in your mouth
[01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.570]  and popped in your mouth?
[01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:19.470]  TikToker makes $200,000 selling her farts in a jar.
[01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:22.090]  Yeah. What?
[01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:27.250]  What if you, Geoff, farted in a balloon and then you cork it off?
[01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.510]  And when you next have to fart again, you fart in the balloon
[01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.990]  and you see how long it takes to pop it.
[01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.010]  Man, I don't know.
[01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:39.350]  I that's a precision that I really like where you're going with this,
[01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:43.150]  but I feel like you're going to let as much fart out as you put in every time you open.
[01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:44.370]  You would need to make device.
[01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:46.550]  Yeah, we'll make like a one way valve.
[01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.050]  OK, yeah, if you can, if you can one way it.
[01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.950]  Yeah, that's what it looked like for you is, I guess, sort of like a
[01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:54.350]  stick on funnel for your butt.
[01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:57.190]  Yeah. So I think it would be a funnel that he would like essentially
[01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:02.450]  put his butt around and fart into and it would leak into a balloon.
[01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.530]  And we can write our guesses on the balloon.
[01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:11.630]  It's you know, it's like that Mario Party minigame where they got to pop it until it
[01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:15.230]  explodes, like how many farts until the balloon pops.
[01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.850]  And I guess there would also be slow leakage.
[01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.730]  So if you didn't find it for like two weeks, you'd probably be down a couple of farts.
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:26.550]  Do you ever get those TikToks of their like lives of people
[01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.730]  that are sitting underneath a balloon and they slowly inflate it based on like interaction
[01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:34.710]  and act like, oh, no, I'm scared for one.
[01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.630]  It'll pop and they're like massive balloons.
[01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:37.770]  I hate that shit.
[01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.330]  Those are all those TikTok channels.
[01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:40.550]  Yeah, awful.
[01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:41.310]  So weird.
[01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:42.530]  I don't even know what I just said.
[01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:47.790]  You being underneath a fart balloon, just be like, oh, no, oh, please don't.
[01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:48.490]  No more fart.
[01:05:48.970 --> 01:05:51.390]  It's like one of those balloons you made a career out of.
[01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:57.310]  And it's like hanging above some dude who is like laying on the ground and it's just
[01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:58.690]  filling up with water and a hose.
[01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:02.190]  And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no galaxy, no galaxy, please.
[01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:02.990]  No, no, no.
[01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.170]  And then people send galaxies, whatever the fuck that is.
[01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.410]  And then it makes the balloon bigger.
[01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:10.030]  Yeah, like like he has a valve that he turns on and off.
[01:06:10.090 --> 01:06:12.970]  And whenever anyone gifts, he turns it like he flips it.
[01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:14.130]  Like a pay to fill.
[01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:15.210]  Exactly.
[01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:18.030]  And it eventually pops and then they just do it over again.
[01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:20.930]  And they're going to they're going to ban this fucking program.
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:21.850]  Can you believe it?
[01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:23.690]  Well, in the US.
[01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.750]  All the value it provides us.
[01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.170]  I'll be able to continue TikTok.
[01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:34.090]  And I'm actually kind of fascinated to see what TikTok would look like with zero US audience.
[01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.650]  Would it just be a bunch of US people with VPNs?
[01:06:37.790 --> 01:06:38.350]  Yeah, probably.
[01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:38.850]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:42.310]  What it looks like today is fucking seven ads for every TikTok.
[01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:48.350]  I don't understand how I get overlapping TikToks with people.
[01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:50.930]  For how many people are making content on that app?
[01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:59.970]  It blows my mind that I will see on my feed a video that I see on somebody like my partner's feed.
[01:07:00.090 --> 01:07:03.210]  I'll see them see a TikTok that I saw like an hour ago.
[01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:07.710]  Your phones are close and it will show you the same shit.
[01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.550]  Okay.
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:09.950]  Well, yeah, it's scientific.
[01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.130]  You guys are algorithmically similar.
[01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:12.470]  I don't know.
[01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:16.670]  But yeah, what Emily and I have like TikTok time in bed at night where we sit, we sit down and watch
[01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:23.230]  the TikToks we've seen each other and more and more it's like for every five TikToks I send her,
[01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:26.010]  she sends me the same three of them back.
[01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:29.990]  You know, it's very rare that we don't have a lot of overlap to the point where you're like,
[01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:31.970]  how, how, how big is TikTok anymore?
[01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:38.050]  Because it's like to me, it's like I repeats of shit I've already seen or fucking ads constantly.
[01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:40.630]  And I feel like I'm playing a fishbowl.
[01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:43.090]  People got to make. Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:44.370]  That's a good way to put it.
[01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:48.190]  Well, we got a lot of stuff that's about to start, I guess.
[01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.270]  I think I need to get in the lab and start working on a fart holding device.
[01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.270]  Good luck, man.
[01:07:54.510 --> 01:08:00.250]  I'm certainly willing to try the apparatus, but that sounds like a tall order to figure out.
[01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:02.270]  Hmm. I hope you can.
[01:08:02.430 --> 01:08:05.130]  I really do. I'd like to I'd like to pop a balloon with my butt.
[01:08:05.250 --> 01:08:09.650]  How long do you think it would take just a regular size balloon, like a party balloon?
[01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:12.710]  Like a fucking six months. Yeah.
[01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:14.390]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:19.030]  I mean, I go there like I'm not recording my farts right now.
[01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:20.830]  I'm just not farting right now.
[01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:24.430]  Yeah, you do that where you just go through phases where you just like
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:25.870]  you just don't have it for a while.
[01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:31.030]  What if you filled the fart balloon and then grabbed the lighter and let the air out?
[01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:32.190]  Would it become a flamethrower?
[01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.770]  Could you could you shoot fire air out of the balloon if you just uncorked it?
[01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.110]  But I don't see why not.
[01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:40.390]  Yeah, I would think so.
[01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:43.270]  A fart flamethrower is pretty good.
[01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:45.910]  Has anyone let me Google this.
[01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:47.410]  Has anyone filled a balloon with a fart?
[01:08:49.190 --> 01:08:51.010]  We should wrap up and.
[01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:55.190]  Next time we could reveal history.
[01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.590]  How many farts does filling a balloon actually require?
[01:08:59.110 --> 01:09:00.310]  I think it depends on the fart.
[01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:01.630]  Not every fart is the same.
[01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:03.810]  I can pay to get the answer.
[01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:10.530]  Should we do a monthly feature where Andrew presents
[01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:12.590]  all the TikToks that America's missed out on?
[01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:14.250]  If it gets banned, yeah.
[01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:21.030]  I'll I'll use my umidigi and I'll film I'll record my soy phone,
[01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:22.550]  my teriyaki phone, whatever it is.
[01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:26.490]  And why would why would why would the umidigi be involved?
[01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:29.310]  Because it's banned in the US and you're all in the US,
[01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:31.070]  so you won't be able to view the TikToks.
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:33.470]  I will need to pull the TikToks.
[01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:37.050]  And my way of pulling the TikToks would be to use the umidigi
[01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:40.290]  to video record the screen of the soy phone.
[01:09:40.450 --> 01:09:42.170]  You wouldn't just capture the screen of the soy phone?
[01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:45.530]  You don't even have to capture, just long press and download the video.
[01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:47.250]  Oh, yeah, I guess I would swipe.
[01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.290]  I would swipe down and screen.
[01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:49.950]  Yeah, OK.
[01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:50.890]  Yeah, that works too.
[01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:53.910]  Uh, I found a subreddit with some math.
[01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:58.330]  And they seem to think you could do it in about 412 farts.
[01:09:59.130 --> 01:09:59.810]  So specific.
[01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:00.770]  Less than I would have assumed.
[01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.550]  Yeah.
[01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:04.650]  So you need to be farting more than once a day if you're going to do it in a year.
[01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:06.150]  Yeah, I'd have to.
[01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:08.290]  Well, I mean, the average person farts like 20 to 40 times a day.
[01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.150]  So I just, you know, I just got to be average.
[01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.590]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:13.290]  How about do we count?
[01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:16.210]  So are they counting toilet farts?
[01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:17.870]  I mean, a fart's a fart.
[01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:19.110]  I guess that's true.
[01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:20.750]  As long as shit's not coming out of it.
[01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:24.910]  Uh, yeah, the fun facts.
[01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:27.530]  Humans pass gas between 13 to 21 times a day.
[01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:31.950]  So a little less than I said, but I think I'm a little more than the average human.
[01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:33.570]  So Eric, what's up?
[01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.930]  Yeah, end of the episode.
[01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:38.110]  Oh, oh, well, there you have it.
[01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:39.130]  Eric told us to end.
[01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:41.530]  Uh, hope you liked this episode.
[01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:42.510]  I hope you got enough.
[01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:46.810]  Because if you didn't, it's probably because Eric made a stop right at this moment.
[01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:49.030]  If you didn't get enough from that, you're a fucking freak.
[01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:50.910]  It's almost an hour and 15 minutes.
[01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.990]  Felt like we were about to hit a hit a whole fart gear.
[01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:59.730]  But we'll have to revisit that in the future as Gavin builds his fart collection device,
[01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:01.130]  which I am very excited.
[01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:02.490]  Now, Gavin, I have a question for you real fast.
[01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.370]  Is this going to go on me like I'll sit on it or is it going to go in me?
[01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.370]  I'm going to have it trying to have it so that we might need to take a mold of your ass.
[01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:15.410]  And then I'll have that plastic that kind of sits on skin really well.
[01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:17.930]  You'd have to like peel it off, but there's no adhesive sort of thing.
[01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:19.390]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:20.290]  OK, I like that.
[01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:23.290]  I like that because I'm not opposed if you had to put a small tube in me.
[01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:26.770]  I would prefer not to have to self-flatulize that way every day.
[01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.290]  But I am interested in doing this for science.
[01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:32.650]  So I want it to be convenient enough that you just think, oh, let me grab this.
[01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:33.550]  There we go.
[01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:35.470]  And not have to like get the hose out.
[01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:40.310]  Yeah, that's a good point, because that is often a lot of times I don't record a fart
[01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:43.830]  because the barrier to entry to getting my phone and record it's a whole thing.
[01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.830]  And so as easy as possible would be better.
[01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:48.750]  All right.
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:49.850]  Well, I guess that'll do it.
[01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:54.210]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:57.190]  We we sure love talking about farts with you.
[01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:01.090]  Hopefully we'll we'll be able to come back next week and talk about other body stuff.
[01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:01.810]  We'll see you then.
[01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.610]  Bye bye.
[01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:03.810]  Bye.
