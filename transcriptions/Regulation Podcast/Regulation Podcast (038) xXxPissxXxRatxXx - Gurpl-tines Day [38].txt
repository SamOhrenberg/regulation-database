[00:00.000 --> 00:05.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 38. It's
[00:05.320 --> 00:10.760]  got to be closing in on about our 250th episode or so, if you consider the old failed company
[00:10.760 --> 00:14.880]  we were a part of. And my name is Geoff Renzi, with me as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Free,
[00:15.140 --> 00:20.540]  Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour. I guess if a company does get shut down, it technically is failed,
[00:20.620 --> 00:27.300]  right? Like, I feel like 20, what, 21 years? That's like saying someone dies at age 95,
[00:27.300 --> 00:31.880]  they failed. They do say that. They do say that. They say, oh, his heart failed. Yeah.
[00:32.460 --> 00:37.280]  I have a friend who says if you don't live to 100, you don't live a full life. Like,
[00:37.440 --> 00:42.080]  Prince Philip died at 99. And the first text that I got from my friend Andrew Douglas was
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.020]  so close to a full life, man. What a bummer. Barely made it as well. Almost made it.
[00:49.980 --> 00:54.340]  I like the idea of Nick having to sync our audio whenever we do a countdown.
[00:55.580 --> 01:00.100]  I like the idea of the second one. He's got to re-sync it. Because he's going to try and
[01:00.100 --> 01:07.320]  sync again. I have a question for you, Gavin. Okay. When's a year old? When is a year old?
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.880]  When is a year old? When does a year become old? You followed me on the Blue Sky a little while
[01:13.880 --> 01:18.640]  back. And I went, oh, Gavin, a profile. And I opened your profile. You had one post that said,
[01:18.640 --> 01:24.720]  Happy New Year. And it made me wonder, when does a year become old? If we get a new year every year,
[01:24.840 --> 01:29.820]  at what point is it an old year? Certainly last year is an old year. Are you saying, like,
[01:29.860 --> 01:33.780]  when is the year itself old? Or when can you stop saying Happy New Year? I'm saying, when does the
[01:33.780 --> 01:38.260]  year itself become old? Are you saying, Geoff, that last year is old year? Yeah. It's becoming
[01:38.260 --> 01:45.200]  older every day. That is true. 2023 is old. For sure. There's some stuff in 2024 that isn't old
[01:45.200 --> 01:51.200]  yet. But I'd say an entire number ago before the last year is old. But would you say that a movie
[01:51.200 --> 01:57.540]  that came out last year is old? Uh... Like, at what point does the year... like, if something
[01:57.540 --> 02:02.240]  released in that year isn't old, then how is the year old? I was trying to figure out, what is a
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.920]  year old? It depends on what you're talking about. Like, Rooster Teeth was, like, 85 years old in
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.760]  internet years. That's true, but that's a different metric. We're talking, like, dog. We're talking
[02:13.760 --> 02:20.140]  internet and human normal years. When's a year old? I think when you take the calendar down
[02:20.140 --> 02:24.780]  to replace it with a new calendar, that year becomes old immediately. Yeah, but three...
[02:24.780 --> 02:28.740]  like, three weeks. It's in the past, man. Stop living in the past. What do you care?
[02:29.600 --> 02:34.100]  That was so long ago. See, I think at least it's like 10 years at least. Whether it was three
[02:34.100 --> 02:39.740]  weeks ago or three years ago, it's still in the past. 10 years? So you think 2016 wasn't a while
[02:39.740 --> 02:45.920]  ago? That's an old year. You don't think pre-pandemic was a long time ago? That was three
[02:45.920 --> 02:53.460]  lifetimes ago. Yeah, it does feel that way in time. I guess this is where it gets dumb. I feel
[02:53.460 --> 03:01.900]  like it's every 10 years, but it changes per year you're in. So 2009, 2010, that's an old year,
[03:01.980 --> 03:09.380]  2009, once you hit a new 10. But if it's 2001, that year doesn't become old until 2010. When does
[03:09.380 --> 03:14.340]  a car become a classic? That's a great question. 20 years or 25 years? I think it probably just
[03:14.340 --> 03:19.920]  follows that. Because it's like consoles become retro after 20. When the year ticks over and
[03:19.920 --> 03:23.620]  you can get a special license plate because it's been so long, that's when it's old. Can somebody
[03:23.620 --> 03:29.240]  look up when does a car become a classic? There's no agreed upon age because it varies by state,
[03:29.320 --> 03:38.460]  unfortunately. What about vintage? When does a car become vintage? Yeah. Okay, a car is generally
[03:38.460 --> 03:46.440]  considered vintage if it was manufactured between 1919 and 1930. Okay, well. I would say that's more
[03:46.440 --> 03:54.280]  of an antique car. Yeah. Do you know what really shit me up about years? What? Wizard of Oz, right?
[03:54.500 --> 04:02.360]  Bloody old movie. Yeah. But when I was born, it was a movie as old as if I watched Taxi Driver
[04:02.360 --> 04:08.080]  now. Yeah, that's always the reverse math is always bad. You shouldn't do that math. It's not
[04:08.080 --> 04:14.900]  good. It never makes you feel good. That's sad maths. In the state of Texas, a car, a passenger
[04:14.900 --> 04:20.340]  car, truck, or motorcycle becomes a classic after 25 years. You can apply for a classic plate. So
[04:20.340 --> 04:26.540]  what was 25 years ago? 2000? Yeah. Every car every one of us drove, with the exception of Gavin,
[04:26.540 --> 04:33.120]  in the year 2000 is a classic car. Oh, fuck. Really? Apparently. How many of us were
[04:33.120 --> 04:40.020]  driving in 2000? I was not. I was a freshman in high school, so I was not driving.
[04:41.140 --> 04:47.220]  Every one of us? Hey, Geoff, you're just classic, baby. I was driving to fucking work with Gus in
[04:47.220 --> 04:54.640]  2000. Jesus. Yeah, that sucks on like a bunch of levels. Anyway, 25 years ago. Not that long.
[04:54.640 --> 04:59.760]  I just looked up wine. Did you know that vintage wine is any wine that has the year printed on it?
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.100]  I thought it had to be really old. Holy shit. Could we print some 2025 vintage wine? Yes,
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.840]  you could. It's literally in the descriptor of wine printed in 2022 would be vintage wine.
[05:11.060 --> 05:17.500]  It's just the year. I think wine uses vintage in a different term than you're using vintage.
[05:17.680 --> 05:21.740]  I think wine... That's just the year. Yes, I think the vintage of the wine,
[05:21.740 --> 05:26.260]  it just means the year of the wine like that. Yes, that's just what I'm saying. I didn't know
[05:26.260 --> 05:35.400]  that. That was my point. I don't drink wine. I didn't know that. I can't be the only one.
[05:35.700 --> 05:40.720]  When you hear vintage, you think I think in a broader way than the specific use that it seems
[05:40.720 --> 05:48.360]  to be used in wine. What about neo vintage? What is neo vintage? So what would that be?
[05:48.920 --> 05:53.460]  I don't know. You're the one that pitched it. It's like if if Neo from the Matrix is 25 years
[05:53.460 --> 06:05.740]  old. I was wondering if he marks it. Oh, it's a watch thing, Gavin. Neo vintage is a watch.
[06:06.200 --> 06:09.220]  Oh, yeah. I think I've heard people talk about neo vintage watches.
[06:09.600 --> 06:13.840]  When it comes to pre-owned watches, there are different categories that differentiate style.
[06:13.840 --> 06:21.600]  Neo vintage. There's no clear answer. Great. This has been the worst trying to define this
[06:21.600 --> 06:29.480]  shit has been all like steampunk. Is neo like steampunk? What? It sounds like it's a style
[06:29.480 --> 06:34.200]  thing, right? Like the use of neon is the same as steampunk, where steampunk represents a style.
[06:35.100 --> 06:39.080]  Not a thing. That's what I gathered from that statement. Anyway, Gavin, continue.
[06:39.700 --> 06:46.280]  Wait, do you think we're saying neo or neon? Neo. Neo. Okay. I'm just making sure.
[06:46.380 --> 06:50.120]  But then you read it and you're like, you said, oh, it sounds like it's like a style,
[06:50.200 --> 06:53.740]  like there's a style of watches that are called neo watches. And so I was saying,
[06:53.800 --> 06:58.640]  is it like steampunk or that's also a style? I'm not saying it looks like steampunk,
[06:58.880 --> 07:03.080]  but in the sense that steampunk is a phrase for a specific style.
[07:03.080 --> 07:09.600]  Neo just means new, combining new, recent, revived or modified. New vintage.
[07:10.980 --> 07:13.900]  Like neolithic. 2025 wine.
[07:15.780 --> 07:22.280]  That just sounds like a scam. I want a book that gets me at a surface level into the lingo of a
[07:22.280 --> 07:28.360]  bunch of different niches. You like flip the page to watch and it's like neo vintage and then you
[07:28.360 --> 07:33.000]  flip the page to like football and it says like Roll Tide or something. It just gets you by and
[07:34.180 --> 07:39.740]  with just random people you meet. You know, I played a game when I was in Detroit over Christmas
[07:39.740 --> 07:46.780]  that was kind of like that. It was a game of global catchphrases and then you'd read a card
[07:46.780 --> 07:55.000]  and then you'd read like three. Everybody had to like write a fake one down and there was one real
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.040]  one and you had to figure out what the real catchphrase was. But we played for like two hours.
[07:58.120 --> 08:02.000]  I'd never heard or recognized a single phrase from that story. And it was just like places,
[08:02.000 --> 08:06.780]  you know, like this is what they say in Rwanda and this is what they say in Sweden. I felt like
[08:06.780 --> 08:11.920]  I was learning all kinds of culture. Maybe we get you that game. Is there a certain subculture
[08:11.920 --> 08:19.180]  that has a vernacular you like their usage of or like a word from it? I like in poker the use of
[08:19.180 --> 08:25.080]  sick. I really enjoy because it means everything. It could be either like you have something
[08:25.080 --> 08:31.100]  horrible happen to you and the response would be that was so sick. Or if it is like you do
[08:31.100 --> 08:35.180]  something amazing, it's like that was that was sick. I didn't realize that was poker. I feel
[08:35.180 --> 08:41.420]  like that's just outside of poker, too. I feel like I hear more so in poker than anywhere else.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.420]  Yeah, poker would definitely be a chapter in this in this regulation lingo book. Wine and coffee
[08:48.420 --> 08:54.220]  would probably have like at least two pages each. Yeah. Oh, wine. I bet you had some snooty ass.
[08:54.720 --> 08:58.780]  Yeah. There's some snooty feels like. Yeah. Snooty itself feels like it's a wine.
[08:59.820 --> 09:05.400]  I don't feel like I use snoot enough. Just in your everyday life? Yeah. Like could snoot be a nose?
[09:05.960 --> 09:11.000]  Yeah. You got to you got to get a dog because I say I think I can help. Yeah. I say it almost
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.720]  every day to my dog. I just go, oh, there's a little snoot. And then I just didn't the Concord
[09:17.720 --> 09:25.240]  have a snoot like a little droop snoot on the front? Droop snoot should be Gavin. I want to
[09:25.240 --> 09:28.960]  talk about this later, actually. Just I'm just going to throw this out there. Droop snoot could
[09:28.960 --> 09:35.380]  be Gavin's 2025 nickname. I'll go droop snoot. I think it's this. Hang on. Is this real? Yeah.
[09:35.420 --> 09:40.040]  The droop snoot. Why is this? This plane looks bummed out. That's why they don't make it anymore.
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.180]  I think they do that because Gus would know this. I think. Well, I think a part of it is
[09:45.180 --> 09:50.800]  so the pilots aren't aimed at the sky the whole way on the runway. So it like snoops, snoots down.
[09:51.460 --> 09:59.120]  I don't know. Drop the snoot. Raise the snoot is jammed. Yeah, because if you're landing a
[09:59.120 --> 10:05.260]  Concord, which no one is anymore, I don't think you'd be able to see the ground if you didn't
[10:05.260 --> 10:12.980]  droop the snoot. This is this episode. Where's that slider thing? I'm up to like a nine right now.
[10:13.860 --> 10:18.580]  It looks almost like a plane that isn't circumcised, as I guess is what I'd describe.
[10:21.200 --> 10:26.060]  Like it looks like there's extra plane. This plane's got extra stuff all over the front of it.
[10:26.100 --> 10:31.100]  It looks like a plane that somebody's older brother broke and then the kid just tried to
[10:31.100 --> 10:34.760]  put it back together as best as he could because he still wanted to run around the yard with it.
[10:35.520 --> 10:41.360]  That's exactly what it is. Yeah, it's the droop snoot. Yeah. What is Sid's toys? Speaking of
[10:41.360 --> 10:47.460]  new nickname droop snoot, I was thinking of the other day, it's 2025 now, right? Fresh year,
[10:47.720 --> 10:54.680]  new start. We've had a lot of different eras throughout the company, one of which was our
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.180]  nickname era when we went through and everybody was getting new nicknames. And I was thinking
[10:58.180 --> 11:04.480]  fresh year, fresh start. My initial thought was maybe we pick new nicknames for everybody that
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.360]  we have that are 2025 nicknames. And I was, you know, thinking I was actually thinking about like
[11:09.360 --> 11:13.400]  I've been thinking a lot about Panama Jack lately, and I want to I'll talk about him later at some
[11:13.400 --> 11:20.220]  point because I want to I want to talk to you guys about it. I want to talk to you guys about a
[11:20.220 --> 11:25.140]  legendary figure I've heard of around these parts called Gerpal Joe. But that's for another another
[11:25.140 --> 11:30.040]  day. I was thinking it'd be fun if we had nicknames that were associated with locations like Eric,
[11:30.160 --> 11:34.880]  because he's the president and because he won the contest. He could be Deputy Eric, right? Because
[11:34.880 --> 11:42.560]  Deputy Indiana, Panama Jack, San Antonio. Nick could be Nick Antonio, right? Nick is so easy to
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.620]  make nicknames for, by the way. But then I had another thought. It evolved from that into what
[11:47.620 --> 11:53.720]  if we did a draft, a nickname draft every year, and then everybody drafts nicknames and the
[11:53.720 --> 11:58.580]  nicknames you get are the nicknames you're allowed to use in that calendar year. So wait, who's
[11:58.580 --> 12:02.680]  drafting a nickname for who? Yeah, we're all drafting our own nicknames from the global pool.
[12:02.680 --> 12:08.580]  And then if you get the nickname you wanted. But you can't pick your own nickname. Like Andrew could
[12:08.580 --> 12:15.060]  like if Andrew got T-Bone before I do, then he gets to be T-Bone for a year. I like the idea,
[12:15.380 --> 12:20.580]  but they're right. You can't pick your own nickname. So I think what we have to do,
[12:20.620 --> 12:25.420]  since there's five of us and we would all have four slots, we have to draft nicknames for each
[12:25.420 --> 12:32.660]  other. So we would have to randomize and then in each slot, I guess the first one would be like,
[12:32.660 --> 12:36.720]  Andrew, and then we all give like our Andrew nicknames, except Andrew. And then the next one
[12:36.720 --> 12:40.600]  would be like Gavin, and we all give Gavin nicknames, except Gavin. And so everyone would
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.160]  have four nicknames. Then we spin a wheel and whatever the wheel lands on is what that person's
[12:46.160 --> 12:50.160]  nickname is for the year. I hate it because I don't want to get stuck with another fucking
[12:50.160 --> 12:57.680]  shitty gooch pooch situation. This is such a good idea, dude. You could absolutely still get,
[12:57.680 --> 13:03.400]  somebody could submit that for you. I'm putting it, no, we can't use old nicknames. You might end
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.980]  up being Droop Snoop for all we know. Oh no. Droop Snoop? What if, for example, I don't
[13:08.980 --> 13:14.720]  understand anyone's going to draft this, but what if all four of the others of us drafted
[13:14.720 --> 13:20.060]  piss rat for Eric? Would he, would one be taken? Well then there would be collusion and we would
[13:20.060 --> 13:26.240]  have to throw it out. We'd have to throw it out. So you can't have dupes. No, I think it would be
[13:26.240 --> 13:29.760]  when you would try to get a gamertag on Xbox Live, someone would just have to put a number on it.
[13:29.840 --> 13:41.940]  I think it would be pissrat01, pissrat69, pissrat420, xPissRatX. Exactly. That's the title.
[13:43.500 --> 13:47.920]  Oh man, this is fucking great. I like this nickname thing. All right, so let's do the
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.280]  nickname draft in the way Eric described it. And then, yeah, and then we do the wheel to determine.
[13:52.440 --> 13:55.960]  And then at the end of it, these are our nicknames for the year. And you stuck with them.
[13:56.860 --> 14:01.000]  I'm putting it in the idea bank. I think we should do this. Okay. Speaking of drafts,
[14:01.060 --> 14:06.700]  we're doing some tomorrow. And speaking of that, I've got a clip. Clip? You want to hear a clip?
[14:07.100 --> 14:10.420]  I would love to. Are you going to be able to play it? Let me just double check that it's not
[14:10.420 --> 14:13.660]  going to play through some headphones somewhere. Okay, here we go. You just redid your whole
[14:13.660 --> 14:24.060]  computer. I mean, yeah, yeah. Don't worry. Here we go. Ready? Not hearing it. Not working.
[14:24.540 --> 14:32.700]  Oh, leave all this in. Okay, I'll tell you what happened. It's just a recording of the YouTube
[14:32.700 --> 14:39.420]  video. And the way that Apple redid their photos app, I couldn't see the play button because it
[14:39.420 --> 14:44.100]  was covered up by a bunch of comments. Here we go. These are good. We'll talk about all these
[14:44.100 --> 14:48.560]  sausage talk or whatever. We want to pitch these ideas later. But like, are we Nostradamus was
[14:48.560 --> 14:52.600]  such a fun. I just like that name so much. It's great. We got to do that soon.
[14:52.600 --> 15:00.080]  I just watched Interview with the Vampire. It's a 94 film. Yeah, I did. A few weeks ago.
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.020]  Was the was the clip, Gavin? Why are we talking about vampires? Because we were talking about
[15:08.020 --> 15:14.900]  it came up previously about doing a wheel of years draft where we pick movies that were born
[15:14.900 --> 15:20.140]  or that movie came out the year we were born. And that came out that time. So I remember
[15:20.140 --> 15:24.920]  specifically, I remember that moment that you're playing. It doesn't fit with what was said, but I
[15:24.920 --> 15:29.640]  had been thinking about it because we had mentioned it like a little prior to that. And I was just
[15:29.640 --> 15:43.460]  sitting on that. I just thought that you thought Nostradamus was Nosferatu. Oh, man. I see what
[15:43.460 --> 15:48.300]  you're doing there. You were laying it out to see if I'd be like, yeah, you know, the guy that knows
[15:48.300 --> 15:56.780]  stuff. Nosferatu, he's a vampire. You were laying the trap. Yeah, I was. No, I know. That's fair.
[15:57.120 --> 16:02.060]  That feels like a mistake I could make. But no, I yeah, that was very similar. It was the
[16:02.060 --> 16:05.700]  transition was a little funky because I was thinking about it prior to and it was a reference
[16:05.700 --> 16:11.160]  I had earlier. Wow, that's that's a rare wriggling of a clip. That's an invalid clip. I take it back.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.700]  But I feel like that was worth it. Like, I'm not mad that you tried that because, man, what a moment
[16:17.700 --> 16:22.400]  if I would have not known. Yeah, you can't be afraid. Hey, you can't be afraid. You can't be
[16:22.400 --> 16:28.760]  afraid to take a shot. Absolutely. I had recently we talked a couple episodes ago about our issue
[16:28.760 --> 16:34.500]  with glasses in the ocean and how the ocean is undefeated. A bunch of people in the comments
[16:34.500 --> 16:41.200]  brought up to me the fact that we used to sell the fucking jet ski kit that had the glasses cord on
[16:41.200 --> 16:45.820]  it that we could wrap that we could put on our glasses so that they would never fucking fall off.
[16:45.820 --> 16:50.540]  And I have like three of them in my fucking house and it never crossed my mind. We used to produce
[16:50.540 --> 16:57.980]  the goddamn things. Whoa. You created the solution to your own problem. Yeah. We created a problem by
[16:57.980 --> 17:03.540]  ignoring the solution we'd already invented. Invented that we'd already put a logo on.
[17:04.100 --> 17:09.200]  I have it's. Can you have one? It's really funny. I'm not in front of me, but I have one in my house.
[17:09.260 --> 17:13.220]  I got a couple of my house somewhere. I think I have two. I have them like there's like a bunch.
[17:13.220 --> 17:17.780]  I have a bunch of old stuff somewhere in a box. Is there any Cancun stuff you guys didn't get to?
[17:17.880 --> 17:23.280]  Was there like a moment where like behind the scenes, you know, maybe some text back and forth
[17:23.280 --> 17:28.260]  of all that was. Oh man, that person really did something dumb and we haven't talked about it
[17:28.260 --> 17:36.420]  publicly. Any of those? Eric was eating some sort of little corn thing and he described it as if
[17:37.060 --> 17:42.440]  it was like a cake or something. And he described it as if someone made creamed corn solid again.
[17:43.200 --> 17:49.140]  Dude, it was I got I got we were at the buffet and I got a cheesecake and then the cheesecake
[17:49.140 --> 17:56.040]  was definitely not cheesecake. It was creamed corn. Yeah, it was it was like a it was like
[17:56.040 --> 18:00.180]  more of like a cornbread kind of a thing. But it was like if they re-solidify like.
[18:00.460 --> 18:07.480]  Imagine it looks exactly like cheesecake. Same consistency and everything like like a key like
[18:07.480 --> 18:13.260]  pie or cheesecake, but it just tasted like fucking like savory ish Swedish sweet corn.
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.540]  It was very strange. Yeah. Another thing that I remember that I don't think we talked about was
[18:18.540 --> 18:24.340]  one night there was entertainment and we watched it. Oh, like a burlesque show thing.
[18:24.840 --> 18:29.320]  And it was really cool. Like the dancing was really impressive. And there was
[18:29.320 --> 18:33.100]  a woman doing like gymnastic stuff, like contortionist stuff that was like really cool.
[18:33.860 --> 18:39.860]  At one point, there was a pole dancer who was doing a pole dance and climbed to the top. It
[18:39.860 --> 18:44.800]  was ultra athletic and it was really impressive. And then she slid down from the top to the bottom.
[18:45.100 --> 18:54.360]  And it was her like legs. What would you say? Skidding down the pole? Think about the most
[18:54.360 --> 19:01.300]  painful time you ever went down a slide at a playground when you were a dry ass metal slide.
[19:01.300 --> 19:07.240]  Yeah, it sounded like that all the way down. Yeah, it was like it was so impressive what she
[19:07.240 --> 19:14.660]  was doing. And then that happened. And it was an audience full of people looking at each other
[19:14.660 --> 19:20.160]  and going, oh, oh, oh, it was pretty cool. Dude, there was a show. Nobody else went but Emily
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.080]  and I, because Emily, half the reason Emily goes to these all inclusives is for the the nightly
[19:25.080 --> 19:30.740]  entertainment. Like she fucking loves it. We went to every show. I think we missed one, but we went
[19:30.740 --> 19:34.880]  every other show. We were the only ones to go to the final show, though, which was called Urban,
[19:35.480 --> 19:42.080]  which was just a lot of like like hip hop dancing. But there were a couple of segments that were
[19:42.080 --> 19:46.360]  just so off the wall. The only thing that was cohesive about it was that it was kind of like
[19:46.360 --> 19:52.560]  hip hop themed, right? Urban. But at one point they had a dance troupe come out and one of the
[19:52.560 --> 19:58.600]  guys, it took me a while to figure it out. One of the guys was dressed up as Quicksilver from that
[19:58.600 --> 20:03.120]  X-Men movie where I think it's like Jesse Eisenberg or whatever. He's got like gray hair
[20:03.120 --> 20:07.740]  and he wears like a silver outfit. Yeah. And then the other dudes were bullies that were beating
[20:07.740 --> 20:12.340]  people up in the street. And then he would come and stop time and then beat them all up and then
[20:12.340 --> 20:16.500]  start time again and then beat them all up and then stop time. And that was a whole routine that
[20:16.500 --> 20:20.580]  went on forever. And it was just suddenly it was a Marvel thing. And then we had a bunch of other
[20:20.580 --> 20:26.340]  weird like there was some jump roping stuff that they did and a bunch of neon stuff. Neo neon,
[20:26.340 --> 20:33.800]  I think they called it. And and then then the final thing was a performance where it was a
[20:33.800 --> 20:39.260]  bunch of dudes that were... I don't know how else to describe it. It was a bunch of guys that were
[20:39.260 --> 20:43.440]  pretending to drive a car and they were hip hop dancing while they were driving the car. And then
[20:43.440 --> 20:47.900]  one of them took out the driver takes out his invisible phone and they start taking selfies
[20:47.900 --> 20:52.120]  of them dancing and not paying attention to driving. And they're all posing and stuff.
[20:52.120 --> 20:58.580]  And then it's like and they fake turn the wheel and then kaboom, the fake car explodes because they
[20:58.580 --> 21:03.120]  were they were they were texting and taking photos instead of driving. And then all the guys fall
[21:03.120 --> 21:09.500]  down on the ground. And then the V for Vendetta guy shows up, but he's dressed all in white like
[21:09.500 --> 21:14.360]  an angel. But he's got like the fucking Guy Fawkes mask on and everything. And he dances around them
[21:14.360 --> 21:19.060]  for a while. And then he pulls out four V for Vendetta masks and he puts them on their chests.
[21:19.060 --> 21:22.800]  And then they come back to life and they all dance together. And then that was it was over.
[21:22.900 --> 21:27.160]  Hell yeah. It was the most bizarre storytelling I think I've ever seen.
[21:27.720 --> 21:31.720]  I dropped a couple of videos in here. They are not necessarily of what Geoff is describing,
[21:31.920 --> 21:37.440]  but it is the same show where people are just dribbling basketballs to a middling crowd.
[21:37.760 --> 21:39.220]  Oh yeah, a lot of basketball dribbling.
[21:39.480 --> 21:45.400]  It's just people watching it. That second video is just an astronaut, I think,
[21:46.400 --> 21:52.360]  dribbling, holding a basketball. And then the L.A. Lakers join him. And it's pretty special.
[21:52.560 --> 21:53.220]  It's pretty cool.
[21:53.560 --> 21:57.720]  What if we sold a photorealistic Guy Fawkes mask?
[21:59.840 --> 22:03.060]  I think that's the best idea I have ever heard.
[22:03.500 --> 22:09.200]  We just take it and it looks kind of like the symbolic part of people like, what's?
[22:10.740 --> 22:12.440]  Well, Guy Fawkes was a guy.
[22:16.400 --> 22:21.220]  I know Guy Fawkes from V for Vendetta. That's my touchpoint of Guy Fawkes.
[22:21.940 --> 22:24.140]  You don't know him from Parliament?
[22:25.460 --> 22:28.040]  No, I don't know anything about Guy Fawkes.
[22:28.440 --> 22:30.980]  I just thought he had a dumb hat on in that photo you posted.
[22:32.340 --> 22:35.900]  I think he tried to blow up Parliament and his name was Guido.
[22:36.800 --> 22:39.340]  Oh, isn't that kind of the plot for V for Vendetta?
[22:40.940 --> 22:42.420]  Wait, is V for Vendetta just a guy?
[22:42.420 --> 22:44.900]  The Guy Fawkes story told in a...
[22:45.480 --> 22:47.180]  I've never seen V for Vendetta, I just know...
[22:48.060 --> 22:51.660]  Has Hugo Weaving in it? And I think it's Matrix-y, maybe?
[22:52.000 --> 22:53.620]  Natalie Portman? Is she in it?
[22:53.640 --> 22:53.980]  It's the Matrix?
[22:54.540 --> 22:59.040]  I feel like for some reason, maybe it's just because Hugo Weaving is in it and I was a kid
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.180]  when I saw it. I associate it with the Matrix for some reason.
[23:02.560 --> 23:05.440]  Does Guy Fawkes get hung, drawn, and caught at the end?
[23:05.920 --> 23:10.540]  I don't remember anything about it outside of he has these knives he throws and there's
[23:10.540 --> 23:15.940]  something about remembering the 5th of November or December or one of the birds.
[23:16.280 --> 23:18.100]  That's right, he's got to get his knives sharpened.
[23:20.600 --> 23:24.520]  Remember the 5th of November or December or something.
[23:24.520 --> 23:25.300]  It's one of the birds.
[23:26.720 --> 23:29.960]  Yeah, in England we have Guy Fawkes night on the 5th of November and that's when we
[23:29.960 --> 23:35.380]  do our fireworks. And we have a bonfire and we sometimes chuck a Guy Fawkes dummy onto it.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.240]  Was Guy Fawkes a knife guy?
[23:39.500 --> 23:44.400]  Because he was in the comic and I feel like he's throwing a lot of knives around.
[23:44.500 --> 23:46.780]  How do you spell Guy Fawkes, Andrew?
[23:47.500 --> 23:50.380]  G-U-Y-F-A-W-K-E-S.
[23:51.420 --> 23:54.000]  One day you should learn about the Gunpowder Plot.
[23:54.620 --> 23:55.680]  The Gunpowder Plot?
[23:56.000 --> 23:56.160]  Yeah.
[23:56.300 --> 23:58.780]  Do you remember Lord of the Rings, or not Lord of the Rings, do you remember
[23:59.540 --> 24:04.040]  King's Landing when they had all the dragons fire under all of King's Landing?
[24:04.100 --> 24:04.820]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:07.240 --> 24:08.340]  What does that have to do with anything?
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.780]  Here, this should be able to catch you.
[24:09.880 --> 24:10.800]  So if you want to...
[24:10.800 --> 24:12.600]  Eric just posted a photo of the Gunpowder Plot.
[24:13.100 --> 24:20.040]  Or a brief account of the bloody and futile defiance laid against the king,
[24:20.220 --> 24:24.020]  his lords and commons in parliament, and a happy deliverance by divine power.
[24:24.800 --> 24:27.000]  Okay, so Guy praying at a window.
[24:27.800 --> 24:28.760]  Wefter minister.
[24:30.140 --> 24:34.520]  I don't know, wefter minister, then a woman praying.
[24:36.060 --> 24:40.320]  And I can't read the bottom part of the text because it is small on my screen.
[24:41.860 --> 24:42.800]  So it's just a bunch of...
[24:42.800 --> 24:45.740]  I don't know what I was supposed to learn from that.
[24:46.940 --> 24:47.820]  They're praying?
[24:48.640 --> 24:50.500]  Yeah, they're praying for gunpowder.
[24:50.940 --> 24:52.320]  Why do they need gunpowder?
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.040]  For the plot.
[24:55.480 --> 24:57.000]  To enact the plot.
[24:57.360 --> 25:00.140]  Was the Matrix part of the Guy Fawkes movie?
[25:00.280 --> 25:01.580]  Can someone look that up?
[25:01.640 --> 25:03.300]  Was V for Vendetta tied to the Matrix?
[25:03.560 --> 25:03.820]  Nobody.
[25:03.980 --> 25:05.400]  Nobody has to look it up.
[25:05.660 --> 25:06.980]  No, yeah, nobody's...
[25:06.980 --> 25:10.960]  No, I think the Matrix people, the Wachowskis, I think were involved.
[25:11.080 --> 25:11.580]  Were they not?
[25:12.300 --> 25:13.780]  Was it not produced by the people?
[25:14.020 --> 25:16.200]  Do you think that makes it tied into the Matrix?
[25:16.820 --> 25:19.420]  Well, I feel like in the trailer, you know,
[25:19.440 --> 25:21.160]  like when you saw the Greatest Showman trailer,
[25:21.260 --> 25:23.760]  they're like from the lyricist of La La Land.
[25:24.220 --> 25:25.640]  It's like it's not related,
[25:25.840 --> 25:28.840]  but like they're promoting the other works of the people connected.
[25:29.240 --> 25:31.760]  In the sense that Hugo Weaving is a big part of both, it's related.
[25:32.260 --> 25:34.320]  I wonder if it's just that, I need to know.
[25:35.080 --> 25:35.660]  And Lord of the Rings.
[25:36.080 --> 25:36.780]  I'll search it up.
[25:36.900 --> 25:37.640]  V for Vendetta.
[25:38.100 --> 25:40.460]  Is Lord of the Rings part of the Matrix universe?
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.180]  No, Peter Jackson has no involvement.
[25:43.860 --> 25:45.300]  But Hugo Weaving was in both.
[25:46.220 --> 25:46.640]  You what?
[25:46.700 --> 25:47.900]  Oh yeah, he's the elf guy.
[25:48.320 --> 25:48.800]  He's Elrond.
[25:49.340 --> 25:50.220]  Elrond the elf guy.
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.860]  I was thinking about this recently where,
[25:53.420 --> 25:58.020]  I like when characters are way more famous than the actor playing them.
[25:58.600 --> 25:59.540]  Like this guy.
[26:00.260 --> 26:03.400]  He could say, he could genuinely say to people,
[26:03.620 --> 26:06.140]  Oh yeah, I was in, uh, I was in Lord of the Rings.
[26:06.800 --> 26:07.940]  And you'd be like, Huh?
[26:08.740 --> 26:09.720]  Who, who do you play?
[26:10.100 --> 26:10.980]  And then he could just say,
[26:11.540 --> 26:12.200]  The Ring.
[26:13.200 --> 26:13.680]  What?
[26:14.300 --> 26:15.040]  The Ring?
[26:15.340 --> 26:16.600]  And you'd be like, Oh, that's cool.
[26:16.960 --> 26:18.660]  You're the ring from Lord of the Rings.
[26:19.220 --> 26:20.720]  But an unassuming face.
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.560]  Yeah, he doesn't look like a ring at all.
[26:23.760 --> 26:25.960]  I mean, he's in a circle, but that's different.
[26:26.440 --> 26:28.440]  Does he sound like the ring sounds normally?
[26:28.580 --> 26:29.540]  Is he like whispering?
[26:29.820 --> 26:30.360]  I don't know, he's dead.
[26:30.800 --> 26:32.300]  He's got three voices layered over.
[26:32.500 --> 26:33.460]  Oh, he probably doesn't.
[26:33.540 --> 26:33.940]  He's a ghost.
[26:34.420 --> 26:37.920]  My mom thought that we were getting our house invaded when I was a kid.
[26:37.920 --> 26:40.660]  Because I got really into Lord of the Rings action figures.
[26:40.900 --> 26:42.280]  That was like the thing I collected.
[26:42.600 --> 26:45.700]  And I had this Sauron one that had a voice box in it.
[26:45.720 --> 26:47.600]  And I played with them in the tub.
[26:47.600 --> 26:49.400]  All my Lord of the Rings figures.
[26:49.740 --> 26:54.900]  And it made the Sauron go off one day, like she was cleaning in a room.
[26:55.220 --> 26:57.360]  And she could just hear this faint like,
[26:57.820 --> 27:01.040]  The darkness is coming... type thing.
[27:01.120 --> 27:01.680]  And she's like, What?
[27:02.080 --> 27:02.260]  What?
[27:02.580 --> 27:04.620]  And then just like a few minutes later, it's like,
[27:04.900 --> 27:06.900]  Oh, the death comes closer.
[27:07.360 --> 27:09.060]  And it freaked her out.
[27:09.620 --> 27:13.220]  And that was the end of my Lord of the Rings toys in that room.
[27:14.480 --> 27:15.360]  Relocated, binned.
[27:15.360 --> 27:17.740]  Maybe Sauron got thrown away.
[27:17.860 --> 27:18.620]  I don't, I don't remember.
[27:18.700 --> 27:23.180]  I just remember it was a big deal that Sauron started talking by himself because I got him wet.
[27:23.680 --> 27:25.160]  And say menacing things.
[27:25.840 --> 27:28.940]  Well, he's got an eye made of fire, I assume.
[27:29.060 --> 27:31.920]  V for Vendetta, the film written by the Wachowskis.
[27:32.020 --> 27:33.000]  I am not insane.
[27:33.700 --> 27:34.580]  Wachowskis related.
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.420]  Thank you.
[27:36.580 --> 27:38.460]  Does that have anything to do with the Matrix?
[27:39.100 --> 27:40.360]  They made the Matrix.
[27:41.340 --> 27:45.020]  I bet you if we were to watch a trailer for V for Vendetta right now,
[27:45.020 --> 27:48.460]  I bet you it says from the people that brought you the Matrix.
[27:49.020 --> 27:52.060]  David Lynch made a racer head in Dune.
[27:52.280 --> 27:54.220]  Do you think those things had anything to do with each other?
[27:54.980 --> 27:56.560]  If they promoted them that way.
[27:56.860 --> 27:57.180]  Maybe.
[27:58.100 --> 27:59.300]  Didn't he do Elephant Man as well?
[27:59.780 --> 28:00.480]  Yeah, of course he did.
[28:00.720 --> 28:02.400]  Nominated for like eight Academy Awards for Elephant Man.
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.080]  How did they get the massive Sauron eye up on that thing?
[28:06.700 --> 28:07.020]  Hoist.
[28:08.440 --> 28:10.240]  Like, where was the foreman?
[28:10.320 --> 28:11.420]  Was the tower already there?
[28:11.540 --> 28:13.000]  And there was some guy still on the roof going like,
[28:13.060 --> 28:14.140]  All right, this is where I'll put the eye.
[28:14.140 --> 28:15.020]  But how did it...
[28:15.460 --> 28:17.020]  Does it explain that in the book?
[28:17.700 --> 28:21.180]  You gotta read the Simarillion or whatever it's called.
[28:22.080 --> 28:23.540]  It's not a physical eye.
[28:23.960 --> 28:24.680]  What do you mean?
[28:25.240 --> 28:25.980]  It's not an eye?
[28:26.340 --> 28:27.800]  I felt like it was a projection.
[28:28.500 --> 28:28.960]  Like it was...
[28:28.960 --> 28:29.940]  It's like a hologram of an eye?
[28:30.020 --> 28:31.060]  I think so, yeah.
[28:31.180 --> 28:33.940]  So where do they put the 4K projector?
[28:35.260 --> 28:36.240]  It's gotta be close.
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.240]  Was it like Disney where they just hide projectors all over the...
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.720]  I think it's more likely than it was a giant eye.
[28:42.060 --> 28:42.980]  I thought it was a giant eye.
[28:42.980 --> 28:44.620]  They knocked the building down to kill the eye.
[28:45.160 --> 28:45.780]  Maybe you're right.
[28:45.880 --> 28:47.540]  I'm not an expert on Lord of the Rings.
[28:47.780 --> 28:50.880]  They put it up a tower, I think, so it could see.
[28:51.020 --> 28:52.940]  I think if it was just a hologram of an eye,
[28:53.040 --> 28:54.020]  why didn't they just put it in a room?
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.740]  Why didn't they just project it on a couch?
[28:56.760 --> 28:57.980]  Because they wanted it to see?
[28:58.580 --> 29:00.440]  How can a projection see?
[29:01.140 --> 29:01.720]  I don't know.
[29:02.320 --> 29:03.400]  There's fucking orcs.
[29:03.700 --> 29:04.240]  There's elves.
[29:05.320 --> 29:08.660]  There's bread that you take a little bite of and it fills you up for a whole meal.
[29:08.820 --> 29:08.980]  I don't know.
[29:08.980 --> 29:14.960]  You're going to use Lampus bread and orcs and elks to explain away...
[29:14.960 --> 29:16.800]  I'm going to say that it's a fantasy world.
[29:17.140 --> 29:22.040]  In a fantasy world, I think it's just as plausible it was a real giant eye up there as anything else.
[29:22.180 --> 29:24.380]  Yeah, I thought you just didn't have like a physical form.
[29:25.100 --> 29:28.160]  I mean, even when he's fighting at the beginning, you can't see Sauron.
[29:28.200 --> 29:29.600]  You just see his armor.
[29:30.100 --> 29:30.380]  That's true.
[29:30.560 --> 29:32.900]  I just assumed it was... well, there's a guy in a suit, right?
[29:33.800 --> 29:36.660]  I don't think there's an actual physical body to it.
[29:36.660 --> 29:39.300]  I thought he was in the suit.
[29:40.980 --> 29:43.720]  Maybe that's what he wants you to think, Andrew.
[29:44.280 --> 29:47.480]  There are people that have all these answers that are really into this that are pulling
[29:47.480 --> 29:49.100]  their hair out listening to us talk about this.
[29:49.160 --> 29:52.060]  I mean, to be fair, he was wearing a ring that makes other people invisible.
[29:52.260 --> 29:53.280]  Maybe it just made him invisible.
[29:55.860 --> 29:56.620]  It's a good point.
[29:57.380 --> 30:00.200]  Nick's pretending that he doesn't know the answers to this stuff.
[30:00.640 --> 30:01.580]  Yeah, fill us in, Nick.
[30:02.500 --> 30:03.220]  No, I don't know.
[30:04.080 --> 30:05.060]  I couldn't tell you.
[30:05.060 --> 30:10.660]  I think Sauron used to be a physical person and then became some manifestation of evil
[30:10.660 --> 30:12.820]  and then became an eye.
[30:12.820 --> 30:14.940]  You can watch the Rings of Power on Amazon.
[30:15.180 --> 30:18.420]  They go into the prequel, the before of all this.
[30:18.560 --> 30:20.340]  I think it's that sleight of shit, though, isn't it?
[30:20.340 --> 30:21.380]  Isn't it a bunch of made up shit?
[30:21.820 --> 30:23.960]  I watched the first couple episodes and they're pretty good.
[30:24.420 --> 30:27.460]  I think it was mostly about Saruman, though, not Sauron.
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.980]  My favorite episode of the Rings of Power show is when they're trying to bring the eye up
[30:31.980 --> 30:34.900]  in the hallways too narrow and they just couldn't get it to fit.
[30:35.560 --> 30:38.120]  It's like six orcs holding it, trying to get it around the corner.
[30:38.120 --> 30:40.380]  Yeah, they're trying to get it up the staircase because it's the new eye.
[30:41.600 --> 30:45.720]  And then they gotta hire that guy who comes and saws it in half to fit it up the stairs
[30:45.720 --> 30:47.380]  and then reassembles it when it's at the top.
[30:47.940 --> 30:48.280]  Yeah.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.180]  Like sofas in New York City.
[30:50.680 --> 30:55.640]  I do really like prequel stories where they show the... like in Better Call Saul, there's
[30:56.200 --> 31:00.340]  a whole bit where they're like digging the lab and it's cool to see like the
[31:00.340 --> 31:02.100]  origin story of a room.
[31:02.260 --> 31:04.860]  And I would love that for Lord of the Rings, just for that tower.
[31:05.260 --> 31:07.120]  I hope we can give that to you someday, Gavin.
[31:07.940 --> 31:09.000]  I don't think we can.
[31:09.700 --> 31:11.760]  Who owns... is that Warner or Amazon?
[31:11.860 --> 31:13.580]  Who owns Lord of the Rings at this point?
[31:14.580 --> 31:15.220]  Is it Amazon?
[31:15.560 --> 31:15.860]  Amazon, I think.
[31:16.380 --> 31:16.700]  Okay.
[31:17.120 --> 31:20.240]  I think that there's like some dispute over who owns what.
[31:20.480 --> 31:21.320]  I think some people own some and other people own others.
[31:21.320 --> 31:23.740]  I think, yeah, there's a weird like 50% and...
[31:23.740 --> 31:24.660]  Yeah, I think so.
[31:25.180 --> 31:28.240]  Hey, can I ask you guys an unrelated to Lord of the Rings question?
[31:28.640 --> 31:28.980]  Of course.
[31:29.600 --> 31:31.900]  I was watching sports last night, right?
[31:31.980 --> 31:32.400]  As I do.
[31:32.540 --> 31:36.100]  I was watching my Celtics play the Clippers in Los Angeles.
[31:36.320 --> 31:37.220]  And of course, we won.
[31:37.300 --> 31:38.020]  Almost blew it.
[31:38.100 --> 31:38.760]  Had to go to overtime.
[31:38.860 --> 31:41.620]  No fucking reason other than just sloppy play.
[31:41.740 --> 31:42.860]  Thank Christ we won.
[31:43.420 --> 31:50.560]  However, I'm watching the game and after about five minutes, there's a guy on the Clippers
[31:50.560 --> 31:52.780]  who's playing out of his mind.
[31:53.040 --> 31:54.660]  His name is Derek Jones Jr.
[31:54.660 --> 31:57.780]  And I'm tangentially aware of Derek Jones Jr.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.140]  as a role filler on teams around the NBA for a while.
[32:02.640 --> 32:03.320]  He's not a superstar.
[32:03.460 --> 32:05.440]  He's not an all-star in no danger of becoming any of those things.
[32:05.560 --> 32:06.900]  Probably a bench player most of the time.
[32:08.420 --> 32:12.620]  And he's playing because on the bench is Kawhi Leonard and James Harden.
[32:12.800 --> 32:15.140]  And they're sitting on the bench in their street clothes.
[32:16.340 --> 32:21.720]  And just watching the game, you know, just fucking courtside in the street clothes
[32:21.720 --> 32:22.420]  because they're not playing.
[32:22.420 --> 32:26.440]  And I got to thinking about how much money those two seats were taking up.
[32:26.480 --> 32:27.420]  And so I looked it up.
[32:28.060 --> 32:34.160]  James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, I think, combined to make about $94 million this year for the
[32:34.160 --> 32:34.440]  Clippers.
[32:35.040 --> 32:39.820]  And I looked up that guy, Derek Jones Jr., who scored 17 points in the first quarter,
[32:39.940 --> 32:40.960]  which is huge.
[32:41.060 --> 32:42.520]  He only went on to score 20 in the game.
[32:43.160 --> 32:45.440]  But he scored 17 points in the first quarter.
[32:46.040 --> 32:48.280]  He makes about $3 million a year.
[32:48.840 --> 32:54.080]  My question to you guys is, oh, also, not only were Kawhi and James Harden in street
[32:54.080 --> 32:56.580]  clothes on the bench, they were sitting next to the coach.
[32:56.940 --> 32:58.480]  They took the good seats on the bench.
[32:58.580 --> 33:02.640]  The players who were playing the game were further down the bench, further away.
[33:03.260 --> 33:09.080]  Like, I mean, just thinking, does a guy like Derek Jones fucking hate Kawhi Leonard and
[33:09.080 --> 33:13.880]  James Harden for, like, getting to basically show up at work in street clothes and eat
[33:13.880 --> 33:20.380]  popcorn and watch him bust his ass while they make a hundred times a year more than
[33:20.380 --> 33:21.000]  he makes?
[33:21.260 --> 33:27.180]  I feel like you're describing every business ever, from, like, the CEO to, like, the people
[33:27.180 --> 33:27.720]  working down.
[33:27.780 --> 33:29.920]  Well, I mean, that's not even... I mean, if we're going to talk about every business
[33:29.920 --> 33:33.340]  there, then the owner is fucking laughing at James Harden and Kawhi Leonard right now
[33:33.340 --> 33:35.600]  because he's making hundreds of millions of dollars an hour.
[33:35.940 --> 33:39.940]  But it's just, like, it's so crazy to see the disparity where they do the same job.
[33:39.940 --> 33:44.240]  They're on the same court at the same time, in theory.
[33:44.700 --> 33:49.320]  But not only is the disparity... because I understand that the talent dictates where
[33:49.320 --> 33:53.280]  money goes, but it's just crazy to me that you can be... you can make that much more
[33:53.280 --> 33:55.140]  and have zero availability.
[33:55.780 --> 33:57.200]  Like, you're just like, I'm Kawhi Leonard.
[33:57.320 --> 34:02.740]  I played 20 games in the last three years, but I'm still going to go to every game in
[34:02.740 --> 34:06.960]  my street clothes, get my free sodas, and make, like, $50 million a year for being, like,
[34:06.960 --> 34:08.740]  a vibes dude, I guess, at this point.
[34:09.460 --> 34:11.380]  I know it's just like a legacy.
[34:13.320 --> 34:17.880]  He doesn't really have a legacy in that arena or with that team because he's been hurt since
[34:17.880 --> 34:18.640]  he got signed to them.
[34:19.060 --> 34:22.640]  He has a legacy from two previous teams, but that didn't... that legacy doesn't travel
[34:22.640 --> 34:24.360]  to the new team where he's done nothing for them.
[34:24.660 --> 34:27.520]  I just, like, it's just crazy to see it on display.
[34:27.640 --> 34:31.100]  And it makes me wonder, is, like, Derek Jones happy that they're proud of him because he's
[34:31.100 --> 34:32.760]  balling out and they're, like, rooting him on?
[34:32.820 --> 34:34.480]  Or is he like, fuck you, man.
[34:34.500 --> 34:38.300]  I'm out here sweating my fucking ass off and you're making more money watching me play than
[34:38.300 --> 34:42.220]  I'm making playing right now because you can't be bothered to put the fucking uniform
[34:42.220 --> 34:42.620]  on.
[34:42.640 --> 34:44.260]  Is that why they're not playing?
[34:45.180 --> 34:49.160]  Uh, I mean, yeah, right?
[34:49.880 --> 34:50.880]  Is that right?
[34:51.500 --> 34:54.760]  Kawhi Leonard should retire if he can't play basketball.
[34:55.000 --> 34:56.560]  Kawhi Leonard should retire.
[34:56.740 --> 34:57.380]  I agree.
[34:57.720 --> 35:01.000]  I don't know that they're out there doing the same job.
[35:01.620 --> 35:02.720]  I also think...
[35:02.720 --> 35:06.100]  No, one of them is doing a job and the other one isn't doing a job at all.
[35:06.480 --> 35:11.660]  I think Derek Jones Jr is probably stoked to be on a team with Kawhi Leonard and James
[35:11.660 --> 35:11.920]  Harden.
[35:12.180 --> 35:12.240]  Why?
[35:12.380 --> 35:14.420]  He's never going to play with Kawhi Leonard.
[35:15.040 --> 35:16.520]  Two guys who are going to sit.
[35:16.920 --> 35:21.220]  And so he gets minutes because he's not somewhere else.
[35:22.580 --> 35:25.840]  If he's going to play somewhere, it's here or the G League.
[35:26.260 --> 35:29.080]  By the way, James Harden was out with groin soreness.
[35:30.120 --> 35:33.140]  Is he, like, cranking off too hard?
[35:33.200 --> 35:34.000]  Or, like, what happened?
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.480]  Yeah, like he pulled a muscle banging somebody and so he can't play.
[35:37.960 --> 35:38.360]  Yeah, he pulled that muscle real hard.
[35:38.360 --> 35:41.320]  We're going to need to have somebody sub in for me next week on the podcast.
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.180]  I understand people getting hurt.
[35:43.900 --> 35:45.560]  I understand injuries are a thing.
[35:45.860 --> 35:46.800]  It's just crazy.
[35:47.400 --> 35:49.860]  I just, I just wonder if I'm Derek Jones Jr in that moment.
[35:49.960 --> 35:51.080]  I'm just like, man, fuck these guys.
[35:51.120 --> 35:51.780]  Don't root for me.
[35:52.200 --> 35:55.760]  Think about, though, in the context of, like, coaches or, like, even hockey.
[35:55.920 --> 35:56.580]  They have buyouts.
[35:57.120 --> 36:00.920]  The premise of, like, you're so not wanted that we will pay you to leave.
[36:01.040 --> 36:03.300]  Like, we'll just pay out the rest of your contract to go.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.080]  Yeah, that's a great way to make money in the NBA.
[36:06.540 --> 36:07.660]  And now here's two things.
[36:07.720 --> 36:10.560]  And here's why I get the point that you're making.
[36:12.100 --> 36:13.080]  There's a reason.
[36:13.400 --> 36:19.880]  When you go to awards for Kawhi Leonard and you see a fourth and rookie of the year,
[36:20.220 --> 36:22.920]  defensive player of the year twice, all star.
[36:23.220 --> 36:29.240]  And then you look at Derek Jones Jr and his award sections real blank all the way down.
[36:29.380 --> 36:30.500]  I think that's why.
[36:30.500 --> 36:35.000]  When was the last time Kawhi Leonard won one of those awards?
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.220]  Once you pop up, the last year that was.
[36:38.440 --> 36:39.880]  It's like two seasons ago.
[36:40.200 --> 36:46.160]  So what I'm saying is that I think Derek Jones Jr is just fine being the role player that he is on
[36:46.160 --> 36:46.620]  that team.
[36:47.020 --> 36:48.360]  I think he's totally fine with it.
[36:48.460 --> 36:54.160]  I think he's so fine with making three million dollars to go out there and put up something.
[36:54.160 --> 36:54.680]  Yeah, I guess.
[36:54.900 --> 36:59.120]  And unless you're in a situation like the Clippers are going to be in where they're
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.820]  going to have to move parts to try to compete in some way, and they're not going to move
[37:02.820 --> 37:03.800]  Kawhi or James Harden.
[37:04.060 --> 37:06.980]  So everybody on that team who's busting their ass right now becomes trade fodder.
[37:07.300 --> 37:09.540]  It's what the Lakers have done the last five years in a row.
[37:09.580 --> 37:14.300]  And they can't build any kind of cohesion or team loyalty because everybody is expendable,
[37:14.400 --> 37:15.040]  but two people.
[37:15.440 --> 37:17.420]  And those two people want to win today.
[37:17.420 --> 37:20.460]  And so they just don't give a fuck about the other people around them.
[37:21.580 --> 37:22.860]  It's just weird to me.
[37:23.340 --> 37:26.680]  It's just weird to me that I haven't seen Kawhi Leonard suit up and play basketball
[37:26.680 --> 37:31.220]  more than three games in the last however many years, but he's still he's taking up
[37:31.220 --> 37:33.300]  a $50 million spot on a bench.
[37:33.340 --> 37:34.300]  It's just wild.
[37:34.620 --> 37:39.980]  It is like a weird thing to think about, like money, not money spent not being used in the
[37:39.980 --> 37:40.620]  way it's intended.
[37:40.920 --> 37:42.960]  But I also feel like that's sports.
[37:43.160 --> 37:47.660]  Like, I feel like the ideal trajectory of an athlete is having...
[37:47.660 --> 37:48.340]  It's sports now.
[37:48.660 --> 37:49.880]  It didn't used to be that way.
[37:50.220 --> 37:50.540]  Sure.
[37:50.600 --> 37:53.720]  Yeah, that that's I had this conversation with friends the other day where they were like,
[37:53.720 --> 37:58.160]  why are their TV shows like ballers and Arliss in like the 2000s?
[37:58.200 --> 38:02.880]  And it's like, oh, because money came into sports in the 80s, in the 90s.
[38:02.960 --> 38:05.860]  I just feel like we just we just throw our arms up and say, oh, that's just the way things
[38:05.860 --> 38:06.440]  are now.
[38:06.500 --> 38:10.340]  But they're that doesn't I mean, I'm not going to change anything.
[38:10.420 --> 38:11.360]  I don't know what I would change.
[38:11.540 --> 38:16.220]  I just it's just wild to me to to see it and to think about it from those terms.
[38:16.220 --> 38:21.060]  Like these dudes are not that different in terms of ability.
[38:21.140 --> 38:21.360]  Sure.
[38:21.360 --> 38:24.820]  Like when you're when you're at the point where you're an NBA player, the difference
[38:24.820 --> 38:29.800]  between the best NBA player on the court and the worst NBA player is fractional.
[38:30.160 --> 38:31.180]  It really is.
[38:31.340 --> 38:34.940]  Like once you're like one of the top four or 500 people in the world doing this thing,
[38:34.980 --> 38:36.620]  it's like that.
[38:36.740 --> 38:40.540]  I think I think that the the scale is the notches on the scale are so minute.
[38:40.900 --> 38:45.580]  And it's just crazy to think that those dudes both are almost exactly as good at basketball
[38:45.580 --> 38:46.280]  as each other.
[38:46.300 --> 38:49.460]  But one of them is playing and making a hundredth of what the other guy is.
[38:49.460 --> 38:53.380]  Do you think when we do the drafts for sports improvements, you can bring something to the
[38:53.380 --> 38:54.720]  table that would fix that problem?
[38:55.180 --> 38:59.020]  I think I didn't think of the sports drafts in that way, but I'm going to go back and
[38:59.020 --> 38:59.520]  re-evaluate.
[39:00.460 --> 39:01.740]  I've been in the lab.
[39:03.160 --> 39:04.520]  Had a little bit of lab time today.
[39:04.880 --> 39:05.240]  You want to see?
[39:05.660 --> 39:05.740]  Yeah.
[39:06.040 --> 39:06.060]  Yes.
[39:07.200 --> 39:08.980]  An unassuming folder.
[39:09.780 --> 39:12.280]  Files for jobs number one and two.
[39:12.560 --> 39:13.740]  What is this?
[39:15.820 --> 39:16.880]  Do you know what that is?
[39:17.300 --> 39:17.640]  No.
[39:17.640 --> 39:19.260]  I think it's a bog roll folder.
[39:19.640 --> 39:21.380]  It's a freaking bog roll folder.
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.140]  I thought it was for...
[39:23.140 --> 39:26.400]  I thought it was files for this and for slow-mo guys.
[39:32.300 --> 39:32.760]  Wow.
[39:33.540 --> 39:35.570]  I crammed a whole bog roll in there.
[39:36.860 --> 39:37.900]  Do you have any other photos?
[39:38.120 --> 39:38.700]  Oh, wow.
[39:39.300 --> 39:40.020]  That's pretty...
[39:40.020 --> 39:40.600]  That's a lot of bog.
[39:41.620 --> 39:43.120]  Now, how many sheets is it?
[39:43.240 --> 39:43.360]  Is it...
[39:43.360 --> 39:43.940]  Is it...
[39:43.940 --> 39:46.880]  How big is each individual portion?
[39:47.640 --> 39:48.000]  I don't know.
[39:48.180 --> 39:50.740]  I just kind of bun-rolled it and split it into quarters.
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.920]  And unfortunately, it's intended purpose, an entire bog roll will not fit under the door.
[39:56.000 --> 39:56.680]  Oh, no.
[39:57.380 --> 39:57.980]  To my bog.
[39:58.320 --> 40:01.700]  So I think it's going to be good for maybe a quarter of a bog roll.
[40:02.220 --> 40:06.380]  It's like an emergency single wipe or single session.
[40:07.120 --> 40:09.840]  Have you thought about doing a filing cabinet of bog roll folders?
[40:10.780 --> 40:12.540]  Well, a whole cabinet of just full of them?
[40:12.980 --> 40:13.200]  Yeah.
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.060]  Do you think if you filled a cabinet with bog roll folders,
[40:18.200 --> 40:20.340]  you could only pull from the cabinet for a year?
[40:21.000 --> 40:21.440]  Oh, yeah.
[40:21.980 --> 40:23.060]  You think you can make it a year?
[40:23.540 --> 40:26.160]  How many sessions is one bog roll?
[40:26.560 --> 40:28.500]  I don't know. I think it depends on you.
[40:28.680 --> 40:29.400]  Like 10, maybe?
[40:30.020 --> 40:30.320]  Yeah.
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.160]  It doesn't come down to how much paper you use per bathroom usage
[40:35.640 --> 40:38.400]  and then how many folders could fit into a cabinet.
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.400]  I feel like this would be a more efficient way to store toilet paper, though.
[40:42.400 --> 40:45.300]  It's not more convenient, but you don't have the air gap.
[40:49.180 --> 40:53.920]  I really like it's more efficient. It's not more convenient.
[40:54.800 --> 40:56.200]  You know, the nice thing about it, too,
[40:56.280 --> 40:59.920]  is a lot of people have magazine racks in their bathroom, you know,
[40:59.960 --> 41:01.800]  or they have like books or magazines for people.
[41:02.060 --> 41:05.060]  You can just slap it in there and it's super unassuming, you know?
[41:05.220 --> 41:09.620]  This also sets up for like a wacky sitcom world where you go to your big business meeting
[41:09.620 --> 41:13.660]  and oh, no, you grab the bog roll folder instead of the pitch deck.
[41:13.680 --> 41:16.320]  And somebody's taking a shit with your TPS report.
[41:16.500 --> 41:17.380]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[41:17.580 --> 41:19.900]  Someone's wiping printer toner all over their anus.
[41:20.760 --> 41:25.740]  I love it, Gavin. I'd love to see the slimmed down version, the bog slim.
[41:26.300 --> 41:28.800]  Yeah, I'll try and work on a version that will slip under the door.
[41:29.220 --> 41:30.040]  That's a great product.
[41:30.260 --> 41:32.340]  Maybe you can just flatten it more. Stomp on it.
[41:32.560 --> 41:33.620]  You got any other lab work?
[41:35.200 --> 41:36.000]  Uh, no.
[41:36.180 --> 41:36.600]  Do you?
[41:38.020 --> 41:40.560]  Pfft, funny you should ask. I've also been in the lab.
[41:41.060 --> 41:42.060]  Excellent. Geoff was in the lab.
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.320]  I was in the lab. Let me, uh, here, let me share my camera with you guys, right?
[41:47.640 --> 41:49.240]  What the fuck? We're getting a camera?
[41:49.520 --> 41:50.880]  Shit, we're in the lab, right?
[41:51.160 --> 41:52.300]  We're truly in the lab.
[41:52.480 --> 41:55.400]  Hang on, is Nick going to record this or what's going on?
[41:55.700 --> 41:57.160]  I mean, I'm with him, yeah, 100%.
[41:58.800 --> 42:02.160]  Uh, yeah, so I have also been in the lab.
[42:02.360 --> 42:06.160]  I don't know if you remember, but last week we were talking about the idea of turduckening fruit.
[42:06.160 --> 42:06.940]  A little bit.
[42:07.480 --> 42:08.300]  Oh, yeah.
[42:08.580 --> 42:13.040]  And so I went to, I went to HEB and, which by the way, got voted, I just read,
[42:13.100 --> 42:15.200]  the best grocery store in America in 2014.
[42:15.200 --> 42:16.380]  Really? Good for you.
[42:16.620 --> 42:19.660]  Yeah, I was going to bring that up on a slightly different subject, uh, down the road.
[42:20.160 --> 42:24.580]  Uh, but I went ahead and I got a bunch of the fruits we discussed and then some additional
[42:24.580 --> 42:28.640]  fruits and I made some combinations. I don't know which one we should go first.
[42:28.640 --> 42:31.000]  The only one I remember was, was chapes.
[42:31.600 --> 42:33.860]  Which is what? A cherry and a grape together?
[42:33.860 --> 42:36.620]  I believe that's what that burlesque lady did down the pole.
[42:36.820 --> 42:37.200]  Chapes.
[42:37.420 --> 42:38.860]  I present to you the chape.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.180]  One half cherry, one half grape.
[42:42.340 --> 42:46.220]  It's, we got a little hat. It looks like Toad from Mario or something.
[42:46.360 --> 42:47.560]  I hollowed that out.
[42:48.780 --> 42:51.240]  Oh, it's got like a little locking system.
[42:51.620 --> 42:51.780]  Yeah.
[42:52.020 --> 42:52.380]  Locked together.
[42:52.900 --> 42:54.220]  Well, then try it. See how it is. I haven't eaten any.
[42:54.260 --> 42:54.920]  It's perfect.
[42:55.740 --> 42:57.460]  Be careful with the seed in there.
[42:58.900 --> 42:59.840]  And got rid of it.
[43:00.800 --> 43:01.240]  Oh, wow.
[43:01.560 --> 43:02.120]  What's the thought?
[43:02.360 --> 43:02.760]  Interesting.
[43:03.860 --> 43:06.580]  It's almost as if the two flavors cancel each other out.
[43:06.580 --> 43:11.740]  I was gonna say, I bet they're so sweet or so tart that you're kind of getting like neither.
[43:12.120 --> 43:12.500]  Very big.
[43:12.540 --> 43:16.260]  But I, but I'm not done. There's a lot of things that you can turducken.
[43:16.420 --> 43:21.380]  For instance, what if you hollowed out a grape and stuck blueberries in it?
[43:22.920 --> 43:24.940]  That looks like a tiny cocktail.
[43:26.040 --> 43:26.560]  Oh.
[43:30.460 --> 43:31.260]  That good?
[43:31.840 --> 43:32.620]  That's better.
[43:32.620 --> 43:33.960]  That's the best one yet.
[43:34.400 --> 43:34.800]  Okay.
[43:35.020 --> 43:38.340]  But not to be outdone, I've also got a cherry and a grape.
[43:39.060 --> 43:41.680]  This way. Oh, no, I'm sorry. This is a cranberry. This is a cranberry. It's not cherry.
[43:41.780 --> 43:42.040]  Cranberry.
[43:42.040 --> 43:42.700]  What's the name of that?
[43:42.700 --> 43:43.280]  This will be good.
[43:43.480 --> 43:45.800]  This is a, uh, uh, crepe?
[43:46.260 --> 43:46.520]  Crepe.
[43:48.100 --> 43:52.320]  But like, there's one is so astringent and the other one's a grape.
[43:54.180 --> 43:55.100]  Don't recommend that.
[43:55.480 --> 43:55.620]  Okay.
[43:56.880 --> 44:01.260]  If you're just listening, Geoff leaned away after he took a bite of that one.
[44:01.260 --> 44:04.080]  Here we have a blueberry cranberry combo.
[44:04.380 --> 44:04.780]  No.
[44:05.420 --> 44:06.540]  It's not gonna be any good.
[44:06.540 --> 44:07.720]  Oh, it was so loud.
[44:08.160 --> 44:09.380]  Oh, that was a crunch.
[44:09.860 --> 44:10.560]  Not good.
[44:10.980 --> 44:14.260]  I think it's the cranberry that's really making things awkward.
[44:14.260 --> 44:16.240]  Oh, here we have a raspberry cranberry.
[44:16.720 --> 44:16.780]  No!
[44:20.260 --> 44:21.540]  Oh, that's gonna be a lot.
[44:21.540 --> 44:22.040]  That's not good.
[44:22.860 --> 44:24.500]  That was not, cranberry's not good.
[44:25.260 --> 44:27.880]  Okay, let's try this. Let's get, move away from grapes for a minute.
[44:28.280 --> 44:29.700]  You don't even have a palate cleanser.
[44:29.700 --> 44:30.520]  How about a...
[44:31.980 --> 44:32.900]  There you go.
[44:33.880 --> 44:35.920]  How about a blueberry cherry combo?
[44:36.420 --> 44:37.260]  That's, that's pretty good.
[44:37.260 --> 44:38.080]  I bet that one's good.
[44:38.220 --> 44:39.100]  Yeah, it's probably good.
[44:42.100 --> 44:43.520]  Second best so far, not the best.
[44:43.640 --> 44:43.920]  Okay.
[44:45.040 --> 44:49.040]  Going back to, going back to grapes, uh, uh, just for a minute.
[44:49.640 --> 44:51.620]  These are green grapes for those listening.
[44:52.160 --> 44:53.080]  These are green grapes, yeah.
[44:53.260 --> 44:54.180]  I wanna, I wanna do a contrast.
[44:54.180 --> 44:54.900]  Yeah, what if the red grape was?
[44:55.260 --> 44:57.260]  Video version available on Patreon and YouTube.
[44:58.240 --> 44:59.700]  What about a grape and a strawberry?
[45:00.440 --> 45:02.040]  That looks real dumb.
[45:03.960 --> 45:08.160]  There's something so disturbing about how they're just sat inside each other.
[45:08.280 --> 45:09.460]  No, that's actually pretty good.
[45:09.900 --> 45:11.960]  Strawberry grape, it might be the best one so far.
[45:12.400 --> 45:12.960]  Okay, straight.
[45:13.680 --> 45:15.920]  Then, uh, I wanted to move bananas into the mix.
[45:15.940 --> 45:18.900]  And I had this whole idea of hollowing a banana out and filling it with blueberries.
[45:20.080 --> 45:22.900]  But my bananas are too crooked and big, and weren't big enough.
[45:22.900 --> 45:24.380]  So I was only able to make this.
[45:24.660 --> 45:26.300]  A banana with a strawberry hat.
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.540]  Come on, you made a red rocket fruit.
[45:29.700 --> 45:36.720]  Yeah, that looks like, that, that looks like if you uncircumcised the droop snoot.
[45:37.160 --> 45:38.000]  Oh boy.
[45:38.020 --> 45:39.140]  It's a fruit snoot.
[45:41.120 --> 45:43.100]  Oh, it's an STD on a droop snoot.
[45:43.440 --> 45:45.740]  I see why people drink, drink banana strawberry.
[45:45.880 --> 45:46.240]  That's good.
[45:46.640 --> 45:47.100]  That's real good.
[45:47.320 --> 45:48.040]  That'd be a good pairing.
[45:48.780 --> 45:50.860]  I'd like to see that with a blueberry on the tip of the strawberry.
[45:53.300 --> 45:56.440]  Then I made, uh, I thought, well, all we're doing is having little finger foods.
[45:56.500 --> 45:57.940]  What if we made an actual sandwich?
[45:57.940 --> 46:02.880]  So what I've done is I took and I made the bread, two slices of, uh,
[46:03.260 --> 46:06.560]  strawberry, and then on top of it, I sliced as the meat and the cheese.
[46:07.100 --> 46:11.280]  Cherry, grape, cranberry, and blueberry.
[46:11.800 --> 46:13.140]  And we'll fold it all together.
[46:13.640 --> 46:15.520]  Like sort of a fruit Big Mac, as it were.
[46:15.520 --> 46:16.640]  Oh, you did great.
[46:18.420 --> 46:18.840]  Flip a leaf.
[46:21.440 --> 46:22.760]  That just a lot of flavor.
[46:22.900 --> 46:23.960]  Is that like a Hawaiian punch?
[46:23.980 --> 46:24.860]  Like a fruit punch?
[46:25.000 --> 46:25.620]  Like, yeah.
[46:25.900 --> 46:27.500]  That's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.
[46:27.500 --> 46:27.880]  Yeah.
[46:28.080 --> 46:32.160]  And then last but not least, the official, the one that started it all,
[46:32.600 --> 46:37.060]  the cherry to the grape to the raspberry to the blueberry.
[46:37.720 --> 46:39.160]  The full deal.
[46:39.900 --> 46:40.960]  The fruit turducken.
[46:41.360 --> 46:43.840]  That looks like it'd give you extra agility in a shooter.
[46:46.020 --> 46:46.500]  Oh.
[46:47.480 --> 46:48.280]  Oh, he struck.
[46:48.360 --> 46:49.100]  He doesn't like it.
[46:49.140 --> 46:49.420]  No good.
[46:49.500 --> 46:50.020]  Not a fan.
[46:50.040 --> 46:51.020]  By far the worst one.
[46:51.480 --> 46:53.240]  The fruits and pole was the worst one.
[46:53.400 --> 46:54.260]  That was not great.
[46:54.520 --> 46:55.480]  That was not great.
[46:55.800 --> 46:56.140]  All right.
[46:56.140 --> 46:58.140]  So there we have there's our lab results.
[46:58.240 --> 46:59.420]  Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[46:59.500 --> 47:01.580]  The second thing I had was the best thing.
[47:01.880 --> 47:03.640]  What do you think made that stack at the end?
[47:03.820 --> 47:04.260]  Not any good.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.720]  Cranberry didn't know there was no cranberry in it.
[47:09.320 --> 47:10.340]  Raspberry didn't help.
[47:10.540 --> 47:10.700]  Yeah.
[47:10.720 --> 47:11.000]  OK.
[47:11.180 --> 47:11.340]  Yeah.
[47:11.360 --> 47:13.960]  I feel like raspberries are very conflicted with a lot of those other flavors.
[47:14.260 --> 47:15.780]  Oh, I want to get into that.
[47:15.840 --> 47:16.900]  I want to get into the same lab.
[47:17.060 --> 47:18.700]  I might come up with some stuff for next week.
[47:18.860 --> 47:19.320]  You should.
[47:19.480 --> 47:19.720]  You should.
[47:19.780 --> 47:20.340]  It's a lot of fun.
[47:21.080 --> 47:22.120]  You know what else is a lot of fun?
[47:22.720 --> 47:23.900]  Drinking stuff out of a gerbler.
[47:24.820 --> 47:25.140]  Oh,
[47:25.700 --> 47:26.540]  we got GERP news.
[47:27.300 --> 47:28.400]  Bring on the GERP news.
[47:28.660 --> 47:29.620]  There is some GERP news.
[47:30.840 --> 47:32.100]  Geoff, Eric, you want to lead?
[47:32.420 --> 47:35.420]  Oh, you're doing you're doing such a good job right now, Andrew.
[47:35.880 --> 47:36.460]  Yeah, I am.
[47:36.500 --> 47:38.640]  So I'm passing the torch before I fumble it.
[47:38.860 --> 47:40.480]  Thanks for passing the torch to me.
[47:40.700 --> 47:46.840]  I'll pick that torch up and I'll shine it high into the darkness to light the world,
[47:46.900 --> 47:49.460]  to let them know that the gerbler is coming.
[47:49.940 --> 47:50.660]  Yes, that's right.
[47:50.660 --> 47:53.900]  The month of February, there will be additional gerblers.
[47:53.900 --> 47:55.280]  Hold on, let me hold the light.
[47:55.500 --> 47:59.620]  I'm going to shine it a little bit higher so we can get a few more people in the back and see.
[47:59.760 --> 48:00.760]  That's right, can you see the date?
[48:01.340 --> 48:02.240]  Can you see the date?
[48:02.320 --> 48:02.740]  It's right there.
[48:02.800 --> 48:05.280]  It's February, but it's two digits.
[48:05.460 --> 48:05.760]  That's right.
[48:05.820 --> 48:06.360]  You can see the date.
[48:06.420 --> 48:07.100]  It's definitely two digits.
[48:07.140 --> 48:08.040]  First digit's a one.
[48:08.460 --> 48:09.140]  First digit's a one.
[48:09.240 --> 48:11.020]  It's going to be easy to figure out the second because they're only...
[48:11.820 --> 48:13.280]  You're going to get some sticks on it.
[48:13.480 --> 48:14.160]  There's going to be a range.
[48:15.840 --> 48:16.480]  February 14th.
[48:16.680 --> 48:19.460]  February 14th, the gerbler will launch.
[48:19.640 --> 48:22.940]  It's happy gerbletines day to you.
[48:22.940 --> 48:31.700]  Our gift to you is a shot at one of 5,000 gerblers that will be launching at noon on February 14th.
[48:31.700 --> 48:32.180]  That's right.
[48:32.420 --> 48:34.640]  Valentine's Day is now gerbletines day.
[48:34.720 --> 48:36.300]  We are co-opting the holiday.
[48:36.580 --> 48:37.820]  We are taking it over.
[48:38.200 --> 48:40.300]  Don Valentine better come and talk to me.
[48:40.520 --> 48:41.320]  I'll set him straight.
[48:41.500 --> 48:43.240]  It's our day now, motherfuckers.
[48:43.740 --> 48:46.880]  Celebrate gerbletines day with us.
[48:47.100 --> 48:52.360]  We're going to be playing Mario Party Jamboree, I believe, over on the Twitch stream.
[48:52.360 --> 48:56.260]  Celebrating the launch of gerbletines day.
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.020]  Now to take it back to where this all begun, obviously, we sold our first black gerbler
[49:01.020 --> 49:04.180]  and we ordered more of those than any other we've had before.
[49:04.420 --> 49:07.540]  And they sold out instantly to our surprise.
[49:08.040 --> 49:10.680]  People were understandably, I really want to one that's disappointing.
[49:10.860 --> 49:13.380]  So we immediately ordered 5,000 more.
[49:13.740 --> 49:17.120]  And the hope is that everyone that wanted one will now be able to get one.
[49:17.560 --> 49:20.480]  We've been waiting ever since that last stream to get these.
[49:20.540 --> 49:21.600]  They're finally arriving.
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.740]  It takes a while for them to be made and then shipped and then get everything all worked out.
[49:25.820 --> 49:29.640]  But they are going to be here February 14th and we're streaming it.
[49:30.020 --> 49:33.620]  And if for some reason they sell out, we will buy more.
[49:33.920 --> 49:34.920]  Yes. No way, surely.
[49:35.800 --> 49:37.220]  There's, I mean, zero chance.
[49:37.320 --> 49:38.440]  Can't we just do a different?
[49:38.520 --> 49:39.720]  Can we do a different gerbler?
[49:40.040 --> 49:41.140]  Do we have to do the same one?
[49:41.160 --> 49:41.880]  We can do a different gerbler.
[49:41.980 --> 49:42.720]  Okay, let's just say this.
[49:42.720 --> 49:43.920]  This is it for this gerbler.
[49:44.060 --> 49:46.400]  The 9,000 of this design is enough.
[49:46.700 --> 49:49.780]  Maybe, who knows, we reserve the right to bring back old styles, blah, blah, blah.
[49:49.900 --> 49:51.400]  I want to move on to a different look.
[49:51.400 --> 49:52.920]  I think we've had so many cool ideas.
[49:53.020 --> 49:54.380]  I want to move on to a different look of gerblers.
[49:54.380 --> 49:58.460]  I want to see what kind of gerbler a guy like Gerpal Joe would drink out of.
[49:58.720 --> 49:59.540]  He seems like it.
[49:59.720 --> 50:00.040]  Who's Gerpal Joe?
[50:00.320 --> 50:02.360]  A mysterious figure, that's for sure.
[50:03.660 --> 50:05.500]  Have you seen, have we seen?
[50:05.780 --> 50:06.260]  Where's Gerpal Joe?
[50:06.480 --> 50:08.220]  I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[50:08.400 --> 50:13.720]  Anyway, it'll be out at noon on regulationstore.com.
[50:13.820 --> 50:18.180]  It'll be noon central, but we'll be live on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod a little
[50:18.180 --> 50:20.820]  before noon to celebrate the launch and then playing.
[50:21.060 --> 50:23.500]  What was the, what did Geoff keep calling Mario Party?
[50:24.160 --> 50:25.000]  Mario Party Jubilee.
[50:25.440 --> 50:25.920]  Jubilee!
[50:26.300 --> 50:26.780]  Jubilee!
[50:27.120 --> 50:28.900]  He kept calling it Mario Party Jubilee.
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.940]  I think it'd be sick if we actually had some gerblers left in the store after that stream.
[50:35.340 --> 50:36.120]  It'd be amazing.
[50:36.860 --> 50:39.120]  Now, are you saying sick good or sick bad?
[50:39.240 --> 50:41.320]  Because depending on the community, sick good could be good.
[50:41.320 --> 50:41.820]  That's true.
[50:42.300 --> 50:44.260]  Dad, are we talking poker terms or what?
[50:44.320 --> 50:44.800]  All in.
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.780]  That was so sick, Gavin.
[50:48.340 --> 50:49.520]  You did it.
[50:49.940 --> 50:51.180]  I'm excited about these.
[50:51.260 --> 50:53.600]  I'm excited about the next gerblers that we're doing.
[50:53.700 --> 50:58.080]  And some more merch that we have coming probably around May.
[50:58.760 --> 50:59.600]  May, yeah.
[51:00.040 --> 51:08.080]  A new, a new revolutionary shirt and some things that you can wave high and proud.
[51:08.220 --> 51:08.660]  But we'll see.
[51:08.780 --> 51:09.680]  That, that's for future.
[51:09.820 --> 51:14.560]  But for right now, Valentine's Day, gerbl, gerbl, gerbl, I can't.
[51:15.040 --> 51:15.900]  Gerbl tine's day.
[51:16.460 --> 51:17.860]  Gerbl tine's day.
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.200]  February 14th at noon central.
[51:21.020 --> 51:23.340]  Will you be our gerbl tine?
[51:24.260 --> 51:25.840]  Like a giant black cup.
[51:26.540 --> 51:29.140]  I told you we could go with a second idea.
[51:29.260 --> 51:30.720]  Didn't have to be that still.
[51:30.900 --> 51:31.100]  I just.
[51:31.180 --> 51:32.880]  What are some of the other hearts say?
[51:33.640 --> 51:35.400]  Gerbl, gerbl heart.
[51:35.700 --> 51:36.620]  Not gerbl hearts.
[51:36.740 --> 51:37.300]  Valentine's hearts.
[51:37.440 --> 51:37.860]  Be mine.
[51:38.080 --> 51:38.700]  Be mine.
[51:38.980 --> 51:39.480]  Be hearts.
[51:39.600 --> 51:40.400]  Be my gerbl.
[51:40.520 --> 51:41.080]  Let's see.
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.680]  Let's workshop this right now.
[51:42.800 --> 51:43.020]  Okay.
[51:43.440 --> 51:44.280]  Gerbl me, baby.
[51:44.900 --> 51:45.080]  Yeah.
[51:45.480 --> 51:46.940]  You're, you're gerbl.
[51:47.580 --> 51:50.360]  Uh, gerbl pie, gerbler pie.
[51:51.880 --> 51:53.160]  Gerbies, not herpes.
[51:53.800 --> 51:54.240]  Uh.
[51:55.940 --> 51:57.980]  Love, uh, gerp, gerp ya.
[51:59.060 --> 52:00.100]  Lil, lil gerp ya.
[52:01.560 --> 52:02.360]  Gerp me.
[52:03.760 --> 52:05.600]  I don't like when he says that.
[52:05.800 --> 52:07.120]  I don't like the way he says it.
[52:07.180 --> 52:08.140]  I don't like what it's implying.
[52:08.180 --> 52:08.800]  I don't like it.
[52:09.880 --> 52:11.360]  Uh, be mine.
[52:11.560 --> 52:14.460]  And then you could flip it on the other side and it says gerbler.
[52:14.740 --> 52:16.700]  Oh, double sided heart.
[52:17.420 --> 52:19.060]  Because most hearts have two sides.
[52:19.600 --> 52:22.500]  So we're just going to photoshop a little gerpl love heart banner thing?
[52:23.260 --> 52:23.580]  Sure.
[52:23.820 --> 52:24.220]  I don't know.
[52:24.540 --> 52:24.860]  Are you?
[52:25.860 --> 52:26.180]  Sure.
[52:26.600 --> 52:28.320]  Are you just reading them all out like we're going to use this somewhere?
[52:28.740 --> 52:29.300]  No, I just go.
[52:29.400 --> 52:32.440]  I was curious what they I was trying to figure out what the best variation would be.
[52:32.480 --> 52:32.820]  It's tough.
[52:32.900 --> 52:33.900]  There's not a lot of natural.
[52:35.100 --> 52:37.280]  Bunch of X's and O's on it.
[52:37.320 --> 52:37.860]  I don't know how we.
[52:37.940 --> 52:38.160]  Yeah.
[52:38.260 --> 52:38.520]  No.
[52:39.620 --> 52:40.080]  What did you say?
[52:40.320 --> 52:40.640]  Gerpeltine?
[52:40.780 --> 52:41.420]  So let's go with that.
[52:41.520 --> 52:41.860]  That was the.
[52:43.040 --> 52:44.540]  It's Eric was pretty insistent.
[52:44.600 --> 52:46.920]  We use gerpeltine and I want to stick to his initial vision.
[52:46.920 --> 52:48.920]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:49.180 --> 52:50.760]  He's the one that coined the phrase.
[52:51.300 --> 52:51.660]  Unfortunately.
[52:51.880 --> 52:53.100]  And then I said, that's the first idea.
[52:53.140 --> 52:54.100]  Let's find a better idea.
[52:54.200 --> 52:55.760]  And then I guess Andrew went through about 12.
[52:55.860 --> 52:57.620]  So maybe gerpeltine is about it.
[52:57.660 --> 52:57.760]  Yeah.
[52:57.780 --> 52:58.560]  I confirm that.
[52:58.740 --> 53:02.020]  And now is the worst idea turned out to be the best.
[53:02.160 --> 53:03.060]  Yeah, unfortunately.
[53:03.820 --> 53:04.920]  It's usually how it goes with this show, but.
[53:05.300 --> 53:11.100]  I realized the other day that a lot of the regulation audience views my career as being
[53:11.100 --> 53:16.220]  in a much different phase than it used to be because we put out the agility tube video
[53:16.740 --> 53:18.260]  for what was that for box standard?
[53:18.860 --> 53:19.040]  Yes.
[53:19.260 --> 53:19.420]  Yeah.
[53:19.580 --> 53:19.740]  Yeah.
[53:19.820 --> 53:20.000]  Sorry.
[53:20.140 --> 53:20.440]  Boxing.
[53:20.700 --> 53:23.680]  And people seem to really like it, like the video.
[53:24.440 --> 53:25.860]  It's just a lot of comments on it.
[53:25.920 --> 53:29.600]  It's where people like guys at your age, you should really be warming up first.
[53:29.920 --> 53:30.900]  You should really be stretching.
[53:33.380 --> 53:35.300]  But I've never had those comments before.
[53:35.600 --> 53:35.820]  Yeah.
[53:36.180 --> 53:36.820]  It's true.
[53:37.360 --> 53:39.040]  I was in so much pain after that.
[53:39.340 --> 53:40.320]  It was for sorry.
[53:40.660 --> 53:41.400]  Just a correction.
[53:41.520 --> 53:42.880]  It was for extra medium and above.
[53:42.960 --> 53:43.540]  It's on Patreon.
[53:43.660 --> 53:44.680]  You can watch it over there.
[53:44.680 --> 53:49.420]  And you're right, because the thing that when I rewatched it, when you get halfway through
[53:49.420 --> 53:52.580]  that tube and you're like, you're not even like yelling.
[53:52.580 --> 53:54.080]  You're like howling.
[53:55.900 --> 53:57.600]  Like, it's not good.
[53:57.700 --> 54:01.220]  It's like very hurt by what you're going through.
[54:01.960 --> 54:07.300]  It looks like one of those beat up tube things you'd have at school that you'd make with
[54:07.300 --> 54:07.740]  what?
[54:08.080 --> 54:08.600]  What was that called?
[54:08.600 --> 54:08.840]  What?
[54:09.060 --> 54:11.180]  Like you would beat up tube.
[54:11.500 --> 54:12.240]  It wasn't a tube.
[54:12.320 --> 54:13.960]  It was people like you'd have like.
[54:14.520 --> 54:18.660]  20 people, like 10 people on each side, and they'd be holding arms and then people have
[54:18.660 --> 54:23.380]  to run under through the tunnel while everyone's kicking you.
[54:23.420 --> 54:24.480]  Did you know that?
[54:25.860 --> 54:27.280]  That sounds like you're getting.
[54:27.480 --> 54:29.520]  That sounds like you're getting jumped into a gang.
[54:30.140 --> 54:33.720]  Keep explaining how you got initiated into your violence gang, please.
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.500]  And you come out all kicked and bruised.
[54:37.080 --> 54:37.620]  Are you OK?
[54:37.880 --> 54:41.720]  And then everybody hugs you and they say you're a member of the family for life.
[54:42.240 --> 54:43.060]  Something like that.
[54:43.660 --> 54:44.540]  Vatos Locos.
[54:44.640 --> 54:44.780]  Yeah.
[54:45.800 --> 54:47.440]  What was the name of this?
[54:48.220 --> 54:49.100]  Chicago Shootout.
[54:49.100 --> 54:52.380]  OK, don't bring up Chicago Shootout.
[54:52.620 --> 54:57.560]  My wife's friend was like, oh, yeah, Chicago Shootout.
[54:57.600 --> 54:58.320]  I remember that.
[54:58.380 --> 55:00.000]  And I think my wife paid her off.
[55:00.120 --> 55:00.620]  I don't think.
[55:00.980 --> 55:01.480]  100 percent.
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.500]  Michaela, I don't believe you.
[55:04.820 --> 55:05.520]  I'm just letting you know.
[55:06.060 --> 55:08.760]  I don't remember what that game was called or whether it had a name.
[55:09.040 --> 55:10.300]  I remember how it felt.
[55:10.300 --> 55:17.680]  But if there's anyone in the audience who also played Run Through the Hurt Tunnel, let me know.
[55:18.780 --> 55:23.020]  But anyway, that's what I sounded like when I went through the agility shoot.
[55:23.320 --> 55:25.660]  We used to play Red Rover when we were kids.
[55:25.740 --> 55:27.540]  It sounds like you played Red Dead Rover.
[55:27.820 --> 55:27.980]  Yeah.
[55:29.340 --> 55:30.940]  Red Rover was violent, too, wasn't it?
[55:30.980 --> 55:32.540]  You get people like clotheslines and stuff.
[55:32.700 --> 55:33.380]  Yeah, of course.
[55:34.760 --> 55:38.640]  Be remiss if we didn't bring it up, but we're getting on towards time.
[55:38.640 --> 55:42.400]  So I do want to hit it now that we've covered sort of like Gerpler stuff and everything.
[55:42.460 --> 55:43.900]  Do you guys squinkle or what?
[55:44.860 --> 55:45.540]  Oh, yeah.
[55:45.540 --> 55:46.140]  I got my squinks.
[55:46.140 --> 55:47.140]  Oh, we got squinks.
[55:47.280 --> 55:47.740]  Squink em, boys.
[55:48.020 --> 55:48.420]  Squinks.
[55:49.140 --> 55:56.020]  So this all started because we saw the squinkles chunks at that airport in Cancun.
[55:56.340 --> 56:04.340]  I went to the Hispanic grocery store down the road just to see if I could get squinkles chunks.
[56:04.520 --> 56:07.700]  But they had the exact same squinkles offering as HEB.
[56:07.700 --> 56:08.940]  Once again, HEB is the best.
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.340]  So I have here Luca's Squinklote and then I have Squinkle's Salsa Getty.
[56:13.680 --> 56:16.120]  I got Squinkle's Salsa Getty.
[56:16.200 --> 56:16.860]  What did you get, Gavin?
[56:17.520 --> 56:18.540]  I have no squinkles.
[56:19.240 --> 56:19.640]  What?
[56:20.620 --> 56:22.340]  OK, so we have to not squink.
[56:22.820 --> 56:23.120]  All right.
[56:23.160 --> 56:24.180]  Lots of weight to squink with Gavin.
[56:24.360 --> 56:25.180]  Holding off on the squink.
[56:25.400 --> 56:28.000]  We will have to future squink.
[56:28.080 --> 56:28.320]  Sorry.
[56:28.900 --> 56:30.280]  No, you can squink and then I'll squink later.
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.220]  Maybe I'll combine some squinks with some fruits.
[56:32.960 --> 56:34.400]  I think we do a big squink together.
[56:34.900 --> 56:35.420]  We already did.
[56:35.480 --> 56:37.480]  We already had two lab sessions in this episode.
[56:37.480 --> 56:38.260]  We can squink later.
[56:40.260 --> 56:42.800]  Oh, speaking of stuff related to this podcast.
[56:44.480 --> 56:45.760]  Hey, speaking of stuff.
[56:46.300 --> 56:49.740]  I owe you guys, Eric and Andrew, vinyls.
[56:49.860 --> 56:52.020]  I don't remember why, but it's in my notes that I owed you both vinyls.
[56:52.100 --> 56:55.080]  So Andrew, I mailed you a vinyl yesterday and Eric, I bought you one.
[56:55.200 --> 56:55.820]  It's in my house.
[56:55.920 --> 56:56.960]  I'll give it to you next time I see it.
[56:57.000 --> 56:57.520]  I'll give it to you tomorrow.
[56:58.660 --> 56:59.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[56:59.300 --> 56:59.520]  Easy.
[57:00.080 --> 57:00.280]  Cool.
[57:00.580 --> 57:01.060]  I'm excited.
[57:02.460 --> 57:05.860]  Another thing that I'm excited about actually is the falcon tier thing.
[57:05.860 --> 57:09.700]  At the time of this recording, a little bit later today, we're doing a falcon tier
[57:09.700 --> 57:11.940]  watch along that finally pays off.
[57:13.020 --> 57:16.140]  Yeah, we are doing a mouse hunt watch along.
[57:16.460 --> 57:18.880]  If you become a falcon, you'll be able to watch it later.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.140]  At the time this is coming out, you've missed it by a week.
[57:21.240 --> 57:24.920]  Sorry, but you'll be able to watch it later over on Patreon.
[57:25.360 --> 57:28.700]  So Andrew had all the rest of the four of us pick a movie.
[57:28.920 --> 57:29.260]  Is that right?
[57:29.400 --> 57:30.360]  And then what happened?
[57:30.760 --> 57:32.000]  Then the falcons voted.
[57:32.640 --> 57:32.900]  Yep.
[57:33.600 --> 57:34.700]  And they picked a mouse hunt.
[57:34.700 --> 57:37.980]  The second most popular was Snake Eyes.
[57:38.240 --> 57:39.140]  Of course it was.
[57:39.240 --> 57:40.380]  I couldn't believe it lost.
[57:40.740 --> 57:41.800]  Like when you said mouse hunt?
[57:41.960 --> 57:42.260]  Crazy.
[57:43.200 --> 57:51.120]  So I'm going to go in order of what I think the spirit of because I went with Blast,
[57:51.240 --> 57:55.300]  the Eddie Griffin Breckenmeyer action movie that I thought was very cool.
[57:55.540 --> 57:56.900]  Yeah, makes sense.
[57:57.260 --> 58:00.160]  Then Eric went with Snake Eyes.
[58:01.160 --> 58:01.880]  Makes sense.
[58:02.160 --> 58:05.400]  I think also kind of related to the show as a bit.
[58:06.020 --> 58:08.040]  Gavin went with Mouse Hunt.
[58:08.320 --> 58:08.820]  That was your pick.
[58:09.280 --> 58:09.980]  That was a great movie.
[58:10.700 --> 58:13.060]  Geoff went with Superfutz, I believe.
[58:13.300 --> 58:14.420]  Also makes sense.
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.460]  I've mentioned it a few times around the time we picked Condor Man.
[58:17.560 --> 58:18.880]  That was the other movie I wanted to pick.
[58:19.160 --> 58:20.940]  I'm still going to make you guys watch it at some point.
[58:21.040 --> 58:22.820]  And Nick went with Air Force One.
[58:24.820 --> 58:25.760]  Air Force One?
[58:26.300 --> 58:28.120]  Nick's like, I just want to watch Air Force One.
[58:28.480 --> 58:28.840]  Yeah.
[58:29.260 --> 58:30.960]  When have we talked about Air Force One?
[58:31.960 --> 58:34.400]  Nick is a huge Air Force One fan.
[58:34.560 --> 58:35.560]  I draft it all the time.
[58:35.960 --> 58:37.160]  You draft it all the time?
[58:37.440 --> 58:38.280]  You've drafted it twice?
[58:38.980 --> 58:40.720]  It was in a draft and then the ranker.
[58:41.160 --> 58:44.580]  Like we're all kind of picking like campy, like kind of group watch movies.
[58:44.660 --> 58:46.040]  And I just love that Nick's just like,
[58:46.100 --> 58:47.660]  nah, Air Force One, let's get everybody together.
[58:47.800 --> 58:48.640]  Let's watch Air Force One.
[58:49.300 --> 58:51.060]  You asked me what movie I wanted to watch with the focus.
[58:51.300 --> 58:52.500]  Yeah, I know. I love it.
[58:52.760 --> 58:53.740]  I think it's a great pick.
[58:54.000 --> 58:54.960]  So which one do you want to watch?
[58:55.120 --> 58:56.940]  Which one was least voted for?
[58:56.940 --> 58:59.440]  Blast, my pick, Eddie Griffin, Brick and Wire.
[58:59.680 --> 59:02.180]  Blast had the lowest percentage of votes.
[59:02.220 --> 59:02.840]  How about that?
[59:03.580 --> 59:07.400]  That's crazy because that's probably talked about the longest to go of all of them.
[59:07.460 --> 59:08.240]  It's, you know what?
[59:08.260 --> 59:11.540]  I would argue it would be one of the most fun watches that we could do.
[59:12.340 --> 59:15.460]  They're playing soccer in the hood now and he bicycle kicks a grenade.
[59:15.640 --> 59:16.060]  It's great.
[59:17.000 --> 59:18.700]  Also, just the embarrassment.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.840]  There is an action scene in it that I watched later in life
[59:21.840 --> 59:24.680]  that I remember as a child watching it going,
[59:24.680 --> 59:26.640]  that was so fucking cool.
[59:26.780 --> 59:29.080]  And then watching it as an adult going,
[59:29.420 --> 59:32.500]  it's maybe the most embarrassed I've ever been about anything.
[59:32.500 --> 59:33.860]  That was a terrible scene.
[59:34.200 --> 59:38.860]  I think that's the kind of context the audience needs before casting a vote.
[59:38.940 --> 59:43.340]  It's like we all need 20 seconds to present our choice.
[59:43.520 --> 59:45.380]  I gave a little bit of context on each pick.
[59:45.980 --> 59:47.620]  That's but that's like, whoa.
[59:47.760 --> 59:51.020]  But that's tough because I agree with you, Gavin.
[59:51.100 --> 59:53.040]  But I also think that that's going to sway.
[59:53.720 --> 59:55.800]  Did you did you say who picked what?
[59:56.680 --> 59:58.800]  I don't think I said maybe.
[59:58.920 --> 59:59.420]  I don't remember.
[59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.740]  But I definitely put flavor in for all the picks of like, this is why.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.300]  I think us because I want to make an effort of like,
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.240]  here's why we should watch it.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:10.280]  And we each do it like a little 20 second blurb.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.840]  But then I think people won't vote for the movie.
[01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.520]  They'll vote for the person who picked it.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.580]  And and and I think I think voting for the movie,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.540]  there's a spirit to this thing, Gavin.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.820]  And I think that's why we just think if you present your movie,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.940]  no one will pick it.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.300]  I think they'll look at me picking a movie versus you picking a movie
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.240]  and pick the movie that you picked versus the movie that I picked.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.140]  Yes. Do I think that?
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.940]  Yeah, I know that. Absolutely.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:43.700]  OK, well, OK, what if you still don't know who picked what?
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.880]  And one person delivers all of the reasoning and context behind the picks?
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.080]  Sure.
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.280]  I mean, yeah, yeah, we can do that.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.700]  I don't think there's a problem with that.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:55.840]  I just think, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.480]  Keeping it anonymous, I think is very important.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:58.780]  Look at this poster.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.460]  V for Vendetta.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.640]  An uncompromising vision of the future from the creators of the Matrix trilogy.
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.620]  Right. Of course.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.740]  I gotta see this movie. Is it good?
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.560]  I don't think so. I don't think it was.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.780]  I have zero memory on it.
[01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.360]  I think it's like 2008 good.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.440]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.440]  Like, it's like it wasn't though.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:22.860]  It was suck.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:24.920]  What a shame.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.180]  73% on Rotten Tomatoes, a lot higher.
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.660]  8.1 on IMDb.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.800]  People seem to like it.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.760]  Stupid hat, stupid movie.
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.660]  It was all it was just like a JVC ad.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.660]  Everything was like a JVC computer or TV.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.680]  Heavy product placement throughout the whole fucking film.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.080]  Yeah, that's what I remember about it.
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:45.780]  I love that clip of David Lynch talking about product placement in movies.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.460]  It's so funny.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:50.300]  So.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:53.300]  Yeah.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.000]  If is Grinch part of the Minions universe?
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.800]  No, but I was explaining why it makes sense that I affiliate V for Vendetta with the Matrix.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:04.900]  Affiliate or associate?
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.640]  You know, I think you can pick.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.620]  It's you know, we live in a free country.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.420]  I mean, he's he's wrong either way.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.660]  So whichever way you want to ascribe that, go for it.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.880]  I want to affiliate is what you get on Twitch.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.860]  You start as an affiliate.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.960]  I'm a partner, so I wouldn't know anything about that.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:26.740]  Fucking brag about it.
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:29.040]  Yes, that's what I was just doing.
[01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.640]  Associate is someone who sells you something like a sales associate.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:42.240]  That is something that is that's one of the definitions of associate.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.660]  Associate is is that is that word?
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.400]  Associate is a different word.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.260]  But that's and you know.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.320]  And what does that spell?
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.060]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:01.150]  I was just about to say we should wrap up and I think you're doing a great job, Geoff.
[01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:03.390]  We we did it.
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:07.830]  We finished the whole goddamn episode and we did it right here in front of you.
[01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:11.670]  And you watch the whole fucking thing unwind because let's be honest,
[01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:13.210]  Nick's not doing too much heavy editing here.
[01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:14.730]  He leaves a lot of the pauses in.
[01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:16.390]  Dennis is the one that makes them snappier.
[01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:18.430]  That's what I learned last week from Gavin.
[01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:20.010]  Thanks for listening.
[01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.070]  And we'll see you next week.
[01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:23.690]  Bye.
[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:24.890]  Love you.
[01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:26.130]  Love you, Dennis.
[01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:26.910]  Bye.
[01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:28.550]  Hey, what the fuck?
