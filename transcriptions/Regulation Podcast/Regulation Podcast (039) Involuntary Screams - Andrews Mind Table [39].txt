[00:00.000 --> 00:03.160]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.320 --> 00:04.600]  This is episode 39.
[00:05.120 --> 00:06.380]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:06.560 --> 00:10.380]  And with me, as always, Andrew, Eric, Nick and Gavin,
[00:10.960 --> 00:13.040]  as they are colloquially known.
[00:13.300 --> 00:15.520]  However, we're going to pick nicknames soon,
[00:15.520 --> 00:17.600]  and I guess we'll have to go by our new monikers.
[00:18.160 --> 00:19.980]  Oh, so are we?
[00:20.120 --> 00:21.480]  How is that working again?
[00:21.520 --> 00:22.860]  So we're doing a nickname draft.
[00:22.940 --> 00:24.060]  We're going to record it tomorrow.
[00:24.800 --> 00:27.260]  We're all picking one nickname for each of us.
[00:27.640 --> 00:29.680]  Then how is the ultimate nickname being decided?
[00:29.680 --> 00:30.500]  Do we pick that?
[00:30.600 --> 00:32.260]  I don't think you should be able to pick that.
[00:32.580 --> 00:33.720]  How does that how's that going to work?
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.640]  You don't get to select your own nickname.
[00:35.800 --> 00:37.500]  So we all. Yeah, we. Yeah.
[00:37.640 --> 00:40.240]  You. So we all select nicknames for each other.
[00:40.520 --> 00:42.280]  And then you're at the mercy of the wheel.
[00:42.500 --> 00:43.800]  Oh, we're at the mercy. Oh, great.
[00:43.900 --> 00:46.840]  OK. Your four nicknames go on the wheel and the wheel gets spun.
[00:47.320 --> 00:48.880]  Are we each bringing one for everybody?
[00:49.400 --> 00:50.020]  Is that how that works?
[00:50.240 --> 00:51.460]  Yeah. Everyone but yourself.
[00:51.840 --> 00:52.900]  Yeah. Are you guys getting mean?
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.340]  I'm not going to tell you where I'm going. I would like to not.
[00:55.500 --> 00:56.740]  OK. Andrew's going to get mean. Cool.
[00:56.740 --> 00:59.200]  I'm thinking. Andrew already got mean on.
[00:59.460 --> 01:00.220]  No, no, no, no. Domus.
[01:00.440 --> 01:01.540]  No, no, no. He got spicy.
[01:02.040 --> 01:02.700]  No, I'm a spicy.
[01:03.060 --> 01:04.660]  But I have.
[01:05.160 --> 01:07.460]  Can I give you one of my scrap names that I had?
[01:07.500 --> 01:12.320]  I had a nickname for Gavin that I really liked, but it has his partner's name in it.
[01:12.720 --> 01:13.780]  So I had to get rid of it.
[01:14.920 --> 01:15.280]  Nutmeg.
[01:18.040 --> 01:18.760]  Jesus Christ.
[01:21.340 --> 01:22.120]  How does that?
[01:22.660 --> 01:25.680]  I was thinking because you're kind of you've been squirrely recently,
[01:25.740 --> 01:27.100]  like you've been a little bit of a menace.
[01:27.100 --> 01:31.200]  And I was like, you know, it feels like a squirrel nut vibe and nutmeg.
[01:31.300 --> 01:33.400]  And I thought Meg's name is in it this week.
[01:33.440 --> 01:35.020]  I can't I can't do it.
[01:35.240 --> 01:38.200]  So it's it's just a coincidence that one of my nuts went bad.
[01:38.660 --> 01:40.880]  Yes. Didn't even think about that.
[01:41.280 --> 01:42.540]  I'm really a really big name.
[01:42.640 --> 01:45.840]  I was really focused in on the squirrel aspect of, hey, Gav.
[01:46.260 --> 01:48.300]  Yeah. Maybe stop living in the past, OK?
[01:49.040 --> 01:51.880]  It's true. That was almost 20 years ago.
[01:54.140 --> 01:56.780]  20 years ago, you've been you've had an injured nut
[01:56.780 --> 02:00.440]  for 20 years or to be 18 years ago.
[02:00.500 --> 02:01.120]  Yeah, 2007.
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.680]  Have you ever done anything in that gap where you're like, man,
[02:03.700 --> 02:06.760]  this would be easier if I had a hundred percent nut on the other side?
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.700]  Well, I would say I'm I'm back at 100 percent nut.
[02:10.060 --> 02:11.420]  Really? Yeah.
[02:11.900 --> 02:14.200]  Yeah. Like both nuts work perfectly right.
[02:14.240 --> 02:16.540]  It's just one is stapled to the side of your body.
[02:17.720 --> 02:19.100]  It's not stapled to my body.
[02:19.180 --> 02:20.140]  It's stapled to the sack.
[02:20.380 --> 02:21.500]  Is the sack part of your body?
[02:22.420 --> 02:25.100]  Yeah. But you always you are a fucking body.
[02:25.100 --> 02:28.060]  You always describe to other people like someone stapled it to my leg.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.640]  That's exactly what it sounded like to me.
[02:29.700 --> 02:31.340]  I thought it was stapled to your sack.
[02:31.660 --> 02:32.660]  Whatever. It's stapled to you.
[02:32.820 --> 02:34.100]  It's you stapled to you.
[02:34.780 --> 02:36.260]  I didn't say it was staple your foot or anything.
[02:36.640 --> 02:39.120]  I mean, I don't know if it makes the the sperm.
[02:39.700 --> 02:41.340]  I don't know if they could test
[02:42.140 --> 02:44.380]  jizz and know which one came from which bollock.
[02:49.060 --> 02:51.980]  Do little jizzes have like nut fingerprints on them?
[02:52.460 --> 02:53.320]  I don't think so.
[02:53.320 --> 02:56.640]  Yeah, there's not like a bunch of lefts and rights.
[02:56.900 --> 03:00.280]  It's like you can tell which which receptacle it came from.
[03:00.360 --> 03:02.240]  Yeah, I don't think so. Right bald, left bald.
[03:02.480 --> 03:06.000]  That's very right. Bald, more creative.
[03:07.880 --> 03:08.740]  Whatever. Yeah.
[03:08.740 --> 03:11.440]  Like, Geoff, you have you have only one kid, so you've only
[03:12.420 --> 03:14.000]  succeeded with one ball so far.
[03:14.480 --> 03:15.840]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[03:16.060 --> 03:17.560]  And then I snipped it.
[03:17.620 --> 03:19.840]  So now it doesn't really mean I can't do it again.
[03:20.720 --> 03:21.600]  She's left handed.
[03:23.220 --> 03:25.780]  So I don't know if that plays any part in it.
[03:25.940 --> 03:27.080]  Well, Nick says same here.
[03:27.440 --> 03:28.240]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:28.240 --> 03:29.020]  I got the old snip.
[03:29.720 --> 03:30.520]  Yeah. Nick's fixed.
[03:30.980 --> 03:31.800]  Nick and I got fixed.
[03:32.140 --> 03:35.320]  We got a spade or neutered, whichever one's appropriate for us.
[03:35.580 --> 03:37.160]  I thought Nick was agreeing he was left handed.
[03:37.600 --> 03:38.920]  I completely misread that.
[03:38.980 --> 03:41.300]  If if you took one of my balls,
[03:42.620 --> 03:44.060]  whose kids would you be having?
[03:44.380 --> 03:45.720]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[03:46.200 --> 03:48.140]  Yeah. Like if you just had someone else's ball put on,
[03:48.220 --> 03:50.340]  does it start making their kids or the ball's kids?
[03:50.860 --> 03:52.680]  Oh, I don't know.
[03:52.880 --> 03:54.800]  That's yeah, I'm too dumb for this.
[03:55.360 --> 03:57.880]  Oh, because it'd be pretty cool to have one of your own
[03:57.880 --> 03:58.780]  and one of someone else's.
[03:58.840 --> 04:00.100]  And then it's just kind of a potluck.
[04:00.700 --> 04:01.200]  Like a split.
[04:01.320 --> 04:03.400]  You know what? Where do babies come from?
[04:03.460 --> 04:04.620]  Is that the title of this episode?
[04:04.880 --> 04:11.100]  No. This is an awesome way to segue into something that happened to me.
[04:11.320 --> 04:14.360]  Oh, Jesus. Monday night that I have been
[04:15.340 --> 04:18.220]  horrified and dying to tell you guys, because it
[04:18.620 --> 04:21.560]  it's kind of related to what we're talking about in some ways.
[04:21.700 --> 04:24.260]  And it it has left me a shaken person.
[04:25.620 --> 04:28.060]  Monday night, I was laying in bed watching TV with my wife,
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.360]  just laying on top of the covers in my jammies
[04:31.360 --> 04:34.500]  because she was going to go to sleep after we finished watching Silo or whatever.
[04:34.820 --> 04:36.500]  And I was going to get up and play Call of Duty.
[04:37.120 --> 04:39.620]  And the dog, he sleeps in bed with us.
[04:39.620 --> 04:41.060]  He's he's pretty good again.
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.760]  He's he's regained his bed privileges.
[04:43.360 --> 04:45.220]  And so he's pretty rad. He's pretty rad.
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.360]  He's getting a lot of the puppy is leaving him
[04:47.360 --> 04:49.140]  and he's just becoming a good sleepy bulldog.
[04:49.540 --> 04:53.960]  But he brought his his hockey stick up into bed with him
[04:53.960 --> 04:55.220]  so that he had something to chew on.
[04:55.280 --> 04:57.460]  He's got this like little Detroit Red Wings hockey stick.
[04:57.540 --> 04:57.860]  We got him.
[04:58.420 --> 05:00.580]  And he likes to be touching me at all times.
[05:00.840 --> 05:03.220]  Albert does at all times.
[05:03.420 --> 05:04.480]  He likes to be touching me.
[05:04.920 --> 05:08.280]  And it's annoying because a lot of times he'll like be chewing on something
[05:08.280 --> 05:09.480]  like right next to my thigh.
[05:09.580 --> 05:12.520]  And I'll just get like sopping wet from like slobber and shit.
[05:13.600 --> 05:15.600]  But you just learn to deal with it, right?
[05:15.620 --> 05:17.060]  Like you kind of get numb to it.
[05:17.060 --> 05:20.620]  And so he climbs kind of on top of me
[05:20.620 --> 05:23.820]  and he drops the the hockey stick like in my lap.
[05:23.940 --> 05:27.180]  And I went, oh, well, that's not where you should be chewing that.
[05:27.320 --> 05:30.740]  And I went, hey, but and right as I did, as I was like, hey, buddy,
[05:31.080 --> 05:35.340]  right as I said that, he bit me so hard, fully on the dick
[05:36.060 --> 05:39.900]  that it changed my life in an instant.
[05:40.060 --> 05:45.280]  I have never in my life felt a pain like that.
[05:45.280 --> 05:49.120]  Like I've never been shocked, alert more quickly.
[05:49.960 --> 05:53.360]  And he like had my dick in his in his mouth for a couple of seconds there
[05:53.360 --> 05:54.420]  because he was like, what?
[05:54.640 --> 05:55.600]  And I'm like, what?
[05:56.040 --> 05:57.120]  And he did.
[05:57.260 --> 06:01.100]  He bit my dick head and my shaft about halfway down the shaft.
[06:01.700 --> 06:05.080]  I have never felt a bruising like that.
[06:05.080 --> 06:06.720]  Like he didn't break the skin or anything.
[06:06.940 --> 06:08.520]  But I went, I screamed.
[06:08.960 --> 06:10.880]  I went, my dick! Like that.
[06:11.840 --> 06:12.600]  Emily goes, what?
[06:12.600 --> 06:15.200]  And I go, he bit my dick! Oh my God!
[06:15.300 --> 06:18.520]  And I jumped up and I just grabbed my dick with both hands
[06:18.520 --> 06:22.580]  and I ran around the upstairs for like, I don't know,
[06:22.660 --> 06:25.220]  a 90 seconds not knowing what to do.
[06:25.360 --> 06:27.080]  I was just in blinding pain.
[06:27.260 --> 06:30.020]  And I didn't know if my dick had been ripped off.
[06:30.100 --> 06:31.480]  I didn't know if I was covered in blood.
[06:31.700 --> 06:34.500]  I couldn't look down because I was too scared.
[06:34.620 --> 06:35.600]  I didn't feel wet.
[06:35.700 --> 06:37.160]  You know, I didn't feel blood in my hands.
[06:37.180 --> 06:38.140]  So I thought that was a good sign.
[06:38.440 --> 06:41.040]  But I genuinely it hurt so unbelievably bad.
[06:41.040 --> 06:42.380]  I just didn't know.
[06:42.800 --> 06:44.040]  And I was scared to find out.
[06:44.200 --> 06:46.780]  So after like 90 seconds of running around in circles,
[06:46.780 --> 06:49.720]  I finally looked down and my dick was still there and I was fine.
[06:49.840 --> 06:53.480]  But it is it was sore for three days.
[06:53.980 --> 06:55.300]  Was it worse than the toilet seat?
[06:56.600 --> 06:58.700]  Yeah, way worse than the toilet seat.
[06:58.800 --> 06:59.700]  Oh my God.
[07:00.360 --> 07:02.220]  Because it was sharp and hard.
[07:02.920 --> 07:04.220]  Did you punish him?
[07:04.800 --> 07:06.320]  Yeah. Did you put Albert in the penalty box?
[07:06.740 --> 07:07.140]  No.
[07:07.800 --> 07:08.900]  Well, it's not his fault.
[07:09.360 --> 07:10.540]  Did you like do it back to him?
[07:10.540 --> 07:12.300]  So that way he knows what it feels like?
[07:13.160 --> 07:15.200]  No, it was a little.
[07:15.260 --> 07:15.760]  It was an accident.
[07:15.880 --> 07:16.820]  My little buddy didn't mean to.
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.000]  But but yeah, it was one of the worst moments of recent memory.
[07:21.420 --> 07:25.020]  And I recommend fully not doing that.
[07:25.100 --> 07:28.000]  If you ever get a chance to not be bitten by a dog on your dick,
[07:28.800 --> 07:30.400]  do your best not to be bitten by a dog on your dick.
[07:30.900 --> 07:33.920]  It is always bad when you scream completely involuntary.
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.440]  Yeah. Involuntarily.
[07:35.460 --> 07:39.480]  I did it on a plane that maybe a year ago where I screamed in someone's face
[07:40.460 --> 07:41.740]  completely out of my control.
[07:41.960 --> 07:42.860]  Just like they spooked you?
[07:43.360 --> 07:46.220]  No, I just had my hand on the on the armrest
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.920]  and someone just bashed their bag into my little finger.
[07:50.440 --> 07:52.100]  And it hurt so much. I just went.
[07:53.100 --> 07:53.900]  Oh, no.
[07:54.520 --> 07:55.740]  And I was like, I'm sorry.
[07:56.060 --> 07:57.840]  I apologize for screaming.
[07:57.940 --> 07:58.780]  It was just shot out.
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.980]  And it made it made the person next to me jump.
[08:04.760 --> 08:05.920]  Made me jump a little bit.
[08:06.900 --> 08:08.340]  I think they thought I was a psycho.
[08:08.340 --> 08:10.920]  It just came out of me because it crushed my finger.
[08:11.820 --> 08:12.860]  That sounds terrible.
[08:13.280 --> 08:15.060]  Oh, how long did it hurt for?
[08:15.640 --> 08:17.140]  Oh, maybe like two seconds.
[08:17.700 --> 08:19.300]  Oh, just instant. Yeah.
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.840]  It was instantly fine.
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.960]  But it just you think the yelling was longer than the pain?
[08:25.240 --> 08:27.680]  I think the yelling was the exact same length as the pain.
[08:30.620 --> 08:33.640]  That makes it even worse, because then you come out of the yell pain free.
[08:34.740 --> 08:36.160]  It just makes it awkward.
[08:36.160 --> 08:38.340]  Like it came and it left immediately.
[08:39.640 --> 08:40.880]  Oh, oh, man.
[08:42.620 --> 08:43.900]  Albert, is he like it?
[08:43.960 --> 08:44.700]  Is he a Red Wings guy?
[08:45.340 --> 08:46.540]  He seems to be. Yeah.
[08:46.660 --> 08:47.240]  Big Red Wings guy.
[08:47.320 --> 08:48.940]  He's pretty into that hockey stick.
[08:49.600 --> 08:51.120]  I yeah, that makes me really happy.
[08:51.200 --> 08:53.540]  Imagine him just running around with a hockey stick.
[08:53.620 --> 08:54.920]  He does cross check in.
[08:55.500 --> 08:58.620]  I will say he's more of a hockey dog than a basketball dog.
[08:58.820 --> 09:02.720]  He tends to favor his hockey toys more than his basketball toys.
[09:03.300 --> 09:06.400]  I have a little Celtics foot, a little Celtics hot dog for me.
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.620]  He's not into it at all anymore.
[09:08.620 --> 09:11.500]  I was thinking about talking about Albert and biting your dick
[09:11.500 --> 09:12.500]  and penalty boxes.
[09:13.380 --> 09:16.280]  Is there outside of hockey, are there other sports
[09:16.280 --> 09:17.940]  where you can accidentally get penalties?
[09:19.100 --> 09:22.020]  Like you can get a penalty, not like doing something
[09:22.020 --> 09:24.200]  unintentionally can get you penalized.
[09:24.920 --> 09:25.140]  Football.
[09:25.520 --> 09:27.460]  But that's like an act of intent.
[09:27.820 --> 09:28.480]  You know what I mean?
[09:28.500 --> 09:29.080]  What's the intent?
[09:29.740 --> 09:30.660]  Like you're trying to.
[09:30.660 --> 09:32.620]  I guess. Yeah, I guess it would be the same.
[09:32.840 --> 09:35.460]  How is it an accident in hockey, but not an accident in basketball?
[09:35.660 --> 09:39.700]  If you shoot the puck clear over the glass, you get penalized.
[09:39.940 --> 09:43.960]  Well, in in a foot in soccer football, if the goalkeeper touches
[09:43.960 --> 09:46.360]  the ball outside the box, it's a penalty.
[09:47.120 --> 09:49.100]  Interesting. OK, it's not an actual penalty.
[09:49.200 --> 09:51.340]  I think it just gets sent off or something.
[09:51.460 --> 09:53.820]  I mean, in like American football, you got to like tackle a guy.
[09:53.900 --> 09:56.300]  You might like your hand might slip and you grab a face mask
[09:56.300 --> 09:59.100]  or you pull him down by like the back of the jersey, like horse collar.
[09:59.100 --> 10:01.160]  Like those aren't typically intentional.
[10:01.640 --> 10:04.960]  In basketball, if you accidentally elbow somebody in the head, that's a foul.
[10:05.340 --> 10:07.100]  Whether you did it on purpose or not.
[10:07.200 --> 10:09.360]  And a lot of times you're not even looking and not even looking
[10:09.360 --> 10:10.700]  in the same direction when it happens.
[10:11.220 --> 10:14.160]  Geoff, I got to say, not after the sports improvements draft, it's not.
[10:16.080 --> 10:18.920]  Oh, I'm very excited about the sports improvement draft.
[10:19.140 --> 10:21.500]  I came up with one last night while I was watching the Celtics
[10:21.500 --> 10:24.200]  game that I cannot fucking wait to jump into.
[10:24.820 --> 10:25.300]  That's great.
[10:25.560 --> 10:27.820]  Are we doing that Friday as well, or is that something else?
[10:27.820 --> 10:30.720]  We are. We're doing nickname draft and sports improvement draft.
[10:30.940 --> 10:32.160]  Awesome. I have a question.
[10:32.540 --> 10:34.260]  Go for it. Why don't we make better helium?
[10:35.020 --> 10:36.420]  Are we almost out of helium?
[10:36.580 --> 10:39.600]  Is that a do we make are we making helium?
[10:39.760 --> 10:41.600]  I don't know anything about helium.
[10:42.060 --> 10:44.080]  I think it's a finite resource, actually.
[10:44.180 --> 10:45.920]  Yes, there's a huge shortage.
[10:46.180 --> 10:47.660]  Wait, there's a helium shortage.
[10:48.000 --> 10:49.520]  Well, we've just used quite a lot of it.
[10:49.520 --> 10:51.600]  And it takes millions of years to get created.
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.460]  And it also is so light that it just leaks out of the top of the atmosphere.
[10:56.940 --> 11:00.760]  But then why can't I just get my balloons filled at like the grocery store with it?
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.200]  Why? What do you mean?
[11:02.600 --> 11:03.860]  It's a rare resource.
[11:04.120 --> 11:05.740]  Well, it's not like that. We're going to run out.
[11:05.820 --> 11:09.640]  It's just as as demand, but as it runs low, it'll just get more expensive
[11:09.640 --> 11:11.660]  until eventually no one can afford it.
[11:11.720 --> 11:13.800]  So we can't make helium? No.
[11:14.600 --> 11:16.200]  How does helium come from?
[11:17.200 --> 11:18.380]  Where does anything come from?
[11:18.900 --> 11:20.960]  Well, like the iPhone comes from Apple.
[11:23.560 --> 11:25.840]  As soon as you ask the question, I'm like,
[11:25.840 --> 11:29.740]  we're about to hear the craziest shit we've ever heard on this podcast.
[11:29.900 --> 11:33.020]  I just, man, words out of your mouth.
[11:33.200 --> 11:34.920]  And I was waiting with bated breath.
[11:35.340 --> 11:38.220]  The iPhone comes from Apple.
[11:38.220 --> 11:39.700]  I can source that product.
[11:40.140 --> 11:42.540]  I think helium just comes from the ground.
[11:43.060 --> 11:45.940]  Apple shut down their helium plant when Steve Jobs died.
[11:46.100 --> 11:47.360]  Oh no. Yeah.
[11:47.820 --> 11:50.140]  Well, is there a company that specializes in helium?
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.660]  There has to be, right?
[11:51.940 --> 11:54.480]  Companies that suck it out of the pockets in the ground.
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.040]  Helium extractors. Yeah.
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.520]  I can't tell if you guys are fucking with me or not.
[11:58.980 --> 12:00.080]  Nobody's fucking with you.
[12:00.420 --> 12:03.180]  Oh, Eric just wrote a non-renewable natural resource
[12:03.180 --> 12:05.420]  that comes from radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.940]  So it's created by other stuff that takes a really long time to decay.
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.580]  But if you're sitting on an old ass uranium and thorium stockpile,
[12:15.680 --> 12:18.200]  you might be you might be sitting pretty.
[12:18.520 --> 12:20.480]  Wait, so you drill in for it?
[12:20.780 --> 12:22.480]  You extract it? Yeah.
[12:22.480 --> 12:25.300]  Yeah. Drill, baby, drill for helium.
[12:26.340 --> 12:27.660]  What do you think fracking is?
[12:27.720 --> 12:29.340]  It's just people trying to get helium for balloons.
[12:29.800 --> 12:32.440]  Yeah, it's fracking is all party city, I think.
[12:32.780 --> 12:35.040]  That's why they went out of business, because they stopped fracking.
[12:35.420 --> 12:37.660]  That's what happened. Oh, Biden.
[12:39.460 --> 12:40.880]  So I'm imagining like Minecraft.
[12:41.120 --> 12:44.300]  Theoretically, you could like hit a wall and then your voice would just get
[12:44.300 --> 12:46.660]  high pitched and you hit a pocket of helium.
[12:46.960 --> 12:48.800]  I don't think it's man drill.
[12:49.020 --> 12:51.680]  I think they're tiny little minuscule holes.
[12:51.680 --> 12:53.840]  No, I got to go with Andrew on this one.
[12:53.900 --> 12:55.980]  You dig a hole too deep and then you sound funny.
[12:56.040 --> 12:59.060]  I think I found it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I found it, guys.
[12:59.940 --> 13:01.200]  I think I found the vein.
[13:02.020 --> 13:04.320]  I do like the idea of like, oh, I wonder what's through here.
[13:04.480 --> 13:05.040]  Oh, shit.
[13:06.440 --> 13:08.480]  It's like a canary for a completely different use.
[13:10.060 --> 13:11.900]  High pitched canary, we found some voice.
[13:12.400 --> 13:14.000]  Oh, my God. Listen, that canary.
[13:14.680 --> 13:16.240]  We struck gold.
[13:17.640 --> 13:20.780]  OK, so they mine it and it's not something we made.
[13:20.780 --> 13:24.980]  Well, and I think hydrogen would be even lighter than helium.
[13:26.180 --> 13:26.940]  Wait, hydrogen.
[13:28.820 --> 13:32.560]  Because it's, it's a, well, it's also very flammable that they don't use it.
[13:32.660 --> 13:33.920]  That's the bomb, right?
[13:36.200 --> 13:37.540]  That's how, well wait.
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.980]  Why are, why are we teaching this to Andrew?
[13:40.300 --> 13:42.440]  Why are we bothering to teach this to Andrew?
[13:43.820 --> 13:45.680]  Is that what you need for water, too, right?
[13:45.680 --> 13:46.380]  You need hydrogen?
[13:48.360 --> 13:49.520]  I mean, it's in water. Yeah.
[13:49.920 --> 13:50.660]  It's part of water.
[13:50.840 --> 13:52.380]  Yeah, it's an element. OK.
[13:53.220 --> 13:54.820]  So can hydrogen float?
[13:54.960 --> 13:56.780]  It's the H part of water.
[13:57.560 --> 13:58.600]  Hydrogen float.
[13:58.980 --> 14:00.160]  Because helium floats.
[14:00.740 --> 14:02.000]  That's why I want helium better.
[14:02.780 --> 14:04.140]  Does rocks float on helium?
[14:06.760 --> 14:09.000]  This is a great, this is our baby.
[14:09.340 --> 14:11.080]  Welcome to 2013 Rooster Teeth.
[14:11.180 --> 14:12.180]  Hell yeah, we're doing it.
[14:14.200 --> 14:17.640]  Now that we've somehow managed to make it fucking
[14:18.460 --> 14:20.440]  15 minutes into this podcast,
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.960]  we should probably mention the goddamn Gurplers.
[14:23.240 --> 14:23.740]  Thank you.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.140]  How much helium would you need to lift the Gurpler?
[14:28.560 --> 14:29.580]  Probably not much.
[14:29.700 --> 14:31.120]  A couple of balloons, I think we do.
[14:31.220 --> 14:33.760]  That's because, yeah, not to go back to helium,
[14:33.840 --> 14:35.660]  but that's like, why aren't we using it more?
[14:36.220 --> 14:37.880]  Because it's a finite resource.
[14:38.260 --> 14:42.620]  OK, so wait, you started with this and then we said it's running out
[14:42.620 --> 14:45.320]  and now you're back to we should do more?
[14:45.780 --> 14:46.460]  We should.
[14:46.460 --> 14:48.000]  Like we need to figure out helium.
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.620]  There needs to be an investment in helium.
[14:50.180 --> 14:51.220]  What do we use it for, Andrew?
[14:51.780 --> 14:55.260]  What I want to use it for is I have stairs in my place
[14:55.260 --> 14:58.040]  and lifting up groceries can be very heavy.
[14:58.680 --> 15:01.720]  And I was thinking of what would be like an easy way to do it.
[15:02.080 --> 15:05.720]  And helium doesn't, you need like a million balloons to lift up two pounds.
[15:07.060 --> 15:08.040]  It's not efficient.
[15:08.860 --> 15:12.400]  So as I was wondering, and you guys are more science minded than I am,
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.060]  why we don't synthesize it?
[15:14.160 --> 15:15.740]  Why aren't we making more effective helium?
[15:15.740 --> 15:17.120]  You know what they say?
[15:17.200 --> 15:19.700]  But now I know necessity is the mother of invention.
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.280]  So maybe what we should do is use through like just blow through
[15:23.280 --> 15:26.720]  the entire global supply of helium as quickly as possible,
[15:26.720 --> 15:29.860]  because then we'll invent the replacement even that much faster.
[15:30.200 --> 15:33.240]  I'm going to go to the grocery store and get six balloons right after this.
[15:33.300 --> 15:34.180]  I'm doing my part.
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.040]  Don't they do?
[15:35.140 --> 15:39.820]  Don't some like Arctic hikers and some people that hike in remote areas,
[15:39.880 --> 15:42.060]  don't they sometimes bring a helium balloon that they'll like
[15:42.060 --> 15:44.620]  or helium balloons they'll attach to their pack to make them a little lighter?
[15:45.860 --> 15:47.940]  I don't. I think that that's true.
[15:48.140 --> 15:48.820]  Hold on. Really?
[15:49.240 --> 15:51.280]  I think you're just describing a balloon fight.
[15:52.280 --> 15:52.920]  Maybe this is how.
[15:55.520 --> 15:56.340]  Oh, maybe.
[15:57.360 --> 15:57.760]  Spoilers.
[15:58.580 --> 15:59.760]  Is that how I get them out of the way?
[16:01.000 --> 16:01.400]  Spoilers.
[16:01.580 --> 16:02.000]  Bleep it.
[16:02.740 --> 16:04.960]  So yeah, Nick posted a photo of the up guy.
[16:05.720 --> 16:07.740]  Imagine if he could do that with like six balloons.
[16:08.100 --> 16:08.880]  That'd be great.
[16:10.340 --> 16:11.740]  I guess it's probably dangerous.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.920]  There's actually there's probably a line in which you can make helium
[16:14.920 --> 16:15.620]  too effective.
[16:16.220 --> 16:18.980]  Well, yeah, it all comes from like radioactive decay, doesn't it?
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.840]  So like what the fuck?
[16:21.320 --> 16:25.900]  The thing that I would use to give me high pitch voice comes from radioactive decay.
[16:26.220 --> 16:27.260]  Yeah. Is that not what it is?
[16:27.320 --> 16:28.720]  I'm pretty like we said that earlier.
[16:28.880 --> 16:29.960]  I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
[16:30.320 --> 16:31.700]  Yeah. We read that.
[16:32.000 --> 16:32.360]  Oh, yeah.
[16:32.740 --> 16:34.620]  Radioactive decay of the uranium in a.
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.980]  Oh, Geoff posting a photo of a backpack.
[16:37.280 --> 16:38.700]  See, this is what I mean.
[16:40.100 --> 16:42.040]  How convenient that would be.
[16:42.240 --> 16:44.460]  So you're not really wearing the backpack that you kind of just.
[16:44.920 --> 16:46.720]  Taking it for a walk with you.
[16:46.740 --> 16:48.080]  That's yes. That's what I want.
[16:48.120 --> 16:48.940]  My groceries today.
[16:49.300 --> 16:50.580]  Now, hang on. Hang on.
[16:50.680 --> 16:53.920]  What Geoff described is people actually doing hikes and this helps them.
[16:54.140 --> 16:56.780]  This appears to be part of like a YouTube video
[16:56.780 --> 16:58.500]  where they're going to do like a gender reveal.
[16:58.800 --> 17:01.340]  What is there's like stuff in the pool.
[17:03.480 --> 17:04.740]  These are this is like the.
[17:04.940 --> 17:07.240]  It's like an empty backpack. What is this?
[17:07.320 --> 17:09.760]  I just thought it was a better image than this one,
[17:09.780 --> 17:12.180]  which is the only other one I could find backpacking with balloon.
[17:12.180 --> 17:16.280]  I like that tiny, tiny little.
[17:18.100 --> 17:21.040]  Is there like a balloon lifestyle thing?
[17:21.160 --> 17:23.320]  Like, can I can I make ballooning my lifestyle?
[17:23.740 --> 17:25.060]  Well, some people get off over it.
[17:25.360 --> 17:27.000]  I'm pretty sure I just like Tiktok on this.
[17:27.060 --> 17:27.780]  And that's why it's in my head.
[17:27.880 --> 17:28.940]  You get off over it. Yeah.
[17:29.200 --> 17:31.180]  What do you know when you say they get off over it?
[17:31.640 --> 17:35.480]  Like they're attracted to the balloon or they're doing something with the balloon
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.860]  or they're like get in them and they get hot in them and they get hard in the balloon.
[17:39.860 --> 17:45.380]  A lot of people find are sexually fulfilled by popping balloons
[17:45.380 --> 17:46.900]  and rubbing on balloons and stuff.
[17:46.900 --> 17:47.900]  There's that fetish, too.
[17:47.900 --> 17:49.700]  I don't want that. I don't like it. There you go.
[17:50.360 --> 17:51.200]  There's one right there.
[17:51.320 --> 17:55.180]  Well, that's one of the biggest balloon perverts on Earth.
[17:55.360 --> 17:56.940]  Can that be the thumbnail?
[17:57.180 --> 17:59.080]  It's the worst picture of a person.
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.620]  It's a picture of slow-mo Dan in a giant balloon.
[18:03.720 --> 18:05.100]  What you can't see because of the balloon.
[18:05.160 --> 18:06.360]  He's coming in that photo.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  Well, that's that's how it's getting so filled at the bottom.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.960]  Do you think that that is...
[18:10.960 --> 18:14.940]  You know how there's there's like the iconic Farrah Fawcett poster.
[18:15.360 --> 18:16.820]  Like there's a certain...
[18:16.820 --> 18:19.480]  Is that is that the number one balloon kink photo?
[18:20.380 --> 18:22.400]  That's actually the next shirt I'm selling.
[18:25.040 --> 18:27.900]  It's just going to be that cut out perfectly on a little black shirt.
[18:28.320 --> 18:30.200]  Oh, dude, that's so funny.
[18:30.520 --> 18:31.560]  Oh, my God, man.

[18:37.640 --> 18:39.480]  Do you know what I ate last night?
[18:40.140 --> 18:44.540]  Wrong. I ate a chicken pot pie pasta Factor meal.
[18:44.920 --> 18:48.120]  I opened it. I stabbed it a little bit, bunged it in the microwave
[18:48.120 --> 18:50.420]  and then shoved it down my gut hole.
[18:50.720 --> 18:52.240]  Was it delicious? Yes.

[19:50.660 --> 19:52.900]  Big old thanks to Factor for sponsoring this episode.
[19:54.840 --> 19:56.780]  Yeah. Can you talk about the GERPLAR style?
[19:57.200 --> 19:59.240]  Oh, yeah. We're doing a GERPLAR thing.
[20:03.380 --> 20:05.740]  Why did you pick up the reins if that's all you're going to do with it?
[20:05.820 --> 20:07.360]  Right. I mean, right.
[20:07.560 --> 20:09.600]  To spike the reins. No, no, no, no, no.
[20:09.660 --> 20:12.220]  OK, wait. I was not taking the reins.
[20:12.400 --> 20:13.360]  No, wait, wait, wait.
[20:13.360 --> 20:14.860]  Wait, did Gavin say Eric?
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.260]  Oh, thank God. I thought you were coming after me.
[20:17.380 --> 20:18.840]  No, no, he wasn't. He definitely wasn't.
[20:19.280 --> 20:20.940]  Oh my God. Oh, sorry.
[20:20.980 --> 20:23.680]  I'm in a defensive posture against Gavin at all times.
[20:23.880 --> 20:26.920]  I think that Geoff naturally is always the guy in the reins.
[20:27.040 --> 20:30.620]  So that was like I'm sitting between Eric and Geoff
[20:30.620 --> 20:32.900]  and I was passing the reins to Geoff.
[20:33.240 --> 20:34.460]  Why would you pass it to me?
[20:34.500 --> 20:37.840]  I brought up the I tried to cut off the helium conversation
[20:37.840 --> 20:39.340]  by bringing up the GERPLAR.
[20:39.520 --> 20:42.780]  And you immediately took it away from me to go back to helium.
[20:42.940 --> 20:46.760]  So then when Andrew, when Eric brought up the fucking GERPLAR,
[20:46.840 --> 20:47.880]  you picked up the reins.
[20:47.960 --> 20:49.420]  You said, oh, yeah. And then you launched it.
[20:49.460 --> 20:51.720]  No, but one sentence, my point.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.480]  And I think if we pulled the audience, they would agree.
[20:53.700 --> 20:55.560]  You're the reins guy of the show.
[20:55.940 --> 20:57.820]  Yeah, but I am not the reins guy, right?
[20:57.860 --> 20:59.560]  Yeah. So why get back to you?
[20:59.560 --> 21:00.740]  Why did you?
[21:01.240 --> 21:02.900]  Because I was excited about it.
[21:03.100 --> 21:06.100]  We don't know where we're all sat in relation to each other in your head.
[21:06.520 --> 21:07.800]  Oh, that's great.
[21:08.300 --> 21:09.740]  That's a great point.
[21:10.040 --> 21:13.160]  I don't know if I'm next to you to take the reins.
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.300]  Yeah. Where where are we?
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.240]  Where are we all sat?
[21:15.440 --> 21:17.820]  OK, so Geoff is on like the end.
[21:17.900 --> 21:22.040]  Like he's to my he's at the front of the he's the head of the table.
[21:22.420 --> 21:23.360]  What is this? What is that?
[21:23.440 --> 21:24.440]  What's what's first off?
[21:24.460 --> 21:26.180]  What shape is the table you're sitting at?
[21:27.180 --> 21:29.340]  Let's say it's like a square table.
[21:29.340 --> 21:30.940]  So let's go a square table.
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.960]  OK, that's their head for five people.
[21:34.080 --> 21:36.800]  Yeah, that's going to be that's going to be difficult, but OK.
[21:36.980 --> 21:42.180]  Yeah, I don't know why we bought this table, but this is the table we're at.
[21:42.520 --> 21:47.060]  So is anybody on your plane with you on your side of the table?
[21:48.560 --> 21:50.860]  Yeah. Who's sitting next to Eric?
[21:51.560 --> 21:53.280]  Left or right? Left.
[21:53.940 --> 21:55.660]  So Eric has immediately left you.
[21:55.920 --> 21:58.220]  Yeah. We got to draw this. Can I draw this?
[21:58.220 --> 21:59.160]  Yeah, please. Go ahead.
[21:59.840 --> 22:01.980]  And then on the left side of the table, who's there?
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.480]  So this is how it goes.
[22:04.140 --> 22:07.420]  It's you on one end, right by yourself on the right side
[22:09.040 --> 22:10.200]  at the bottom.
[22:11.200 --> 22:12.880]  What the fuck is that?
[22:13.640 --> 22:15.520]  What is the bottom of a table?
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.740]  Am I under the legs?
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.680]  No. OK, we're going to I'm shifting the table one sec.
[22:22.380 --> 22:23.940]  So I'm at the bottom of the table.
[22:24.100 --> 22:26.300]  You're at the right side of it.
[22:26.420 --> 22:27.240]  You're at the right side.
[22:27.240 --> 22:29.020]  So you're by yourself on the right side of it.
[22:29.700 --> 22:31.640]  So Geoff's on the right and he's alone.
[22:32.120 --> 22:33.300]  He's alone on the right.
[22:33.740 --> 22:34.840]  I'm to his left.
[22:36.380 --> 22:37.480]  Well, oh, God.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.560]  He's alone, but you're you're on the other corner.
[22:40.880 --> 22:41.920]  Yeah, I'm on the other corner.
[22:42.100 --> 22:45.020]  Yeah. To the edge between us.
[22:45.040 --> 22:46.640]  I'm to his left. Got it.
[22:47.300 --> 22:48.640]  Eric is to my left.
[22:49.480 --> 22:52.120]  Eric is to your left, but on the same side of the.
[22:52.180 --> 22:53.820]  But on the same side of the table. Yes.
[22:53.940 --> 22:54.860]  Oh, shit. OK.
[22:55.220 --> 22:56.660]  So you're in the same panel.
[22:56.660 --> 22:57.780]  Yeah. Yeah. Keep going.
[22:58.280 --> 23:01.800]  OK, then Nick is on the other end, looking directly at Geoff.
[23:03.240 --> 23:05.060]  Yeah, that makes me uncomfortable.
[23:05.820 --> 23:08.320]  Gavin, you're on the opposite side of the table by yourself
[23:08.820 --> 23:10.300]  next to Geoff on the other corner.
[23:10.760 --> 23:13.020]  OK, so now I just need to write some labels in these.
[23:13.280 --> 23:15.600]  We've got. Geoff.
[23:17.160 --> 23:18.280]  See if this is accurate.
[23:18.580 --> 23:19.460]  I think that was pretty clear.
[23:20.280 --> 23:21.600]  Andrew, we got there.
[23:22.840 --> 23:24.520]  Wait, Eric was next to Andrew.
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.160]  Yep. Nick on the other end is looking straight at Geoff.
[23:30.360 --> 23:34.700]  Yep. I'm curious if other people think about this.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.360]  People listening. Is this what you imagine?
[23:38.760 --> 23:41.860]  What is your table like? Save as.
[23:44.400 --> 23:45.820]  I don't know if you need to save it.
[23:45.880 --> 23:47.880]  I don't think there's necessarily a long term use.
[23:48.100 --> 23:53.860]  I opened paint to to try to do the same thing, and it crashed so fast.
[23:53.860 --> 23:57.200]  I drew a table, wrote Geoff, and then it went, we're done here.
[23:57.440 --> 23:58.840]  And it shut down on me.
[24:00.560 --> 24:02.020]  And that's enough of that.
[24:03.740 --> 24:05.160]  Where did that save to?
[24:05.600 --> 24:06.280]  OK, it doesn't matter.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.140]  We're done. Tables are done.
[24:08.740 --> 24:11.400]  Why isn't there like, hey, where did I just put the thing?
[24:11.520 --> 24:12.760]  Hey, but you know what else is on the table?
[24:12.900 --> 24:14.560]  A gerbler, Geoff, take it away.
[24:15.960 --> 24:17.080]  Well, that's right, Andrew.
[24:17.220 --> 24:21.280]  There is a gerbler on the table because we are very excited.
[24:21.700 --> 24:27.620]  Dare I say, proud to announce that the next gerbler drop will be this February
[24:28.460 --> 24:30.400]  the 14th. That is right.
[24:30.600 --> 24:36.000]  Valentine's Day is being rebranded globally to Gerpeltine's Day.
[24:36.600 --> 24:39.540]  February 14th is now officially Gerpeltine's Day.
[24:39.620 --> 24:44.140]  If you wanted to get one of the gorgeous black gerblers, black as death,
[24:44.480 --> 24:49.480]  black as night, you can get one on Gerpeltine's Day, February 14th, 2025.
[24:49.480 --> 24:55.660]  We have purchased 5,000 god damn gerblers.
[24:55.940 --> 25:00.820]  Hopefully that means you will be able to get the gerbler of your dreams and desires.
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  And what better way to do it than on Gerpeltine's Day?
[25:04.100 --> 25:06.360]  Give yourself the gift of Gerpeltine.
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.120]  Give the gift of Gerpeltine to someone that you love or cherish or respect
[25:11.120 --> 25:13.460]  or just medium OK with.
[25:13.520 --> 25:14.840]  Hell, even if you don't like them,
[25:14.840 --> 25:17.160]  maybe you can repair the relationship
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.900]  with a gerbler available to you globally on Gerpeltine's Day,
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.860]  February 14th, 2025 at 12 p.m.
[25:27.860 --> 25:32.000]  noon Central Time, where we'll be streaming at twitch.tv
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.800]  slash the regulation pod.
[25:34.180 --> 25:38.980]  And I feel like if if you can't get one this time, I genuinely don't know what to do.
[25:39.060 --> 25:40.600]  Yeah, it's to be clear.
[25:40.800 --> 25:44.240]  We ordered these when we sold out immediately in the last one.
[25:44.240 --> 25:46.540]  This is how long it takes for them to come back in.
[25:46.680 --> 25:47.880]  This is the reorder.
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.800]  Yeah, try to make sure people get black when the black gerblers that they wanted.
[25:53.140 --> 25:57.040]  But before we get to Gavin's drawing, let's let's wrap this part out.
[25:57.100 --> 26:00.400]  But something that we were able to get faster
[26:00.920 --> 26:04.940]  and something we wanted to get to the people
[26:04.940 --> 26:09.580]  are no scrumping signs and protected by Falcon signs.
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.820]  We've reprinted those the original art and everything, the original sizing,
[26:13.820 --> 26:15.860]  no scrumping, protected by Falcons.
[26:15.980 --> 26:19.320]  But Andrew had a really good idea regarding those signs.
[26:19.860 --> 26:22.880]  Well, it was a hotly debated topic when we're discussing it
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.000]  because we wanted to restock these things, but we couldn't determine
[26:26.600 --> 26:28.160]  which was wanted more.
[26:28.760 --> 26:30.880]  We had different views on that.
[26:30.940 --> 26:33.840]  And then also like how many to order for each
[26:33.840 --> 26:37.880]  because we don't want people to be disappointed like we never want.
[26:38.080 --> 26:40.540]  We want to be able to provide merch for people that want it.
[26:40.560 --> 26:41.460]  That's always the goal.
[26:41.460 --> 26:45.060]  But we've we've never sold more than 300 of those things.
[26:45.160 --> 26:50.740]  I don't think which makes it hard for us to determine the true demand for it.
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.840]  And also there's, I think, a fun layer of this of we were talking about
[26:55.880 --> 26:59.860]  gauging this for a future merch release type thing.
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.040]  We're kind of debating between what would sell fastest
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.020]  when we do this stream or what we'll even sell more of.
[27:07.120 --> 27:08.100]  I guess there's not.
[27:08.260 --> 27:10.920]  I mean, it's very possible we don't sell out on either of these things.
[27:10.920 --> 27:12.380]  But what would be more popular?
[27:13.040 --> 27:15.600]  And so I talked with our wonderful mod team.
[27:15.900 --> 27:20.360]  You guys, you want to pop in like you click the regulation pod discord,
[27:20.540 --> 27:21.540]  which is free, by the way.
[27:21.580 --> 27:24.240]  We should put a link in the info of this.
[27:24.320 --> 27:25.360]  The meta for this.
[27:25.720 --> 27:27.920]  Yeah. Please join the regulation discord.
[27:28.420 --> 27:29.860]  Yeah, if at all. Totally free.
[27:30.160 --> 27:30.740]  It's a lot of fun.
[27:31.140 --> 27:32.960]  So it's great. It's an amazing server.
[27:33.500 --> 27:34.380]  You guys click in.
[27:34.520 --> 27:35.760]  I'm going to guide you to something.
[27:36.220 --> 27:37.300]  We put our votes down.
[27:37.300 --> 27:38.800]  OK. Whoops.
[27:38.980 --> 27:40.620]  Oh, shit. Join Jeremy's.
[27:41.720 --> 27:43.500]  Is all right. I'm on the
[27:45.800 --> 27:48.260]  I'm in Jack's Sunday group.
[27:48.740 --> 27:53.000]  No, that's not where they play seven days to die or whatever.
[27:53.320 --> 27:54.280]  OK, no, I'm in.
[27:54.660 --> 27:57.040]  I'm in the regulation pod. OK.
[27:57.640 --> 28:00.120]  So once you're in, you'll see at the top, there is a category
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.500]  called podcast announcements and then a channel called the sign vote.
[28:04.780 --> 28:05.740]  The sign vote. OK.
[28:05.740 --> 28:09.080]  So this provides all the information of like where it is on the store,
[28:09.140 --> 28:10.280]  when they go up and all that.
[28:10.460 --> 28:13.100]  Wow. What we're doing is we're picking sides
[28:13.100 --> 28:14.680]  and we're going to see who's going to win.
[28:14.780 --> 28:15.420]  You can pick a team.
[28:15.660 --> 28:16.880]  You can only pick one team.
[28:17.300 --> 28:20.960]  And then once the stream goes live, this will be turned off
[28:20.960 --> 28:23.620]  and you're locked in to whatever you pick.
[28:24.020 --> 28:28.320]  Whatever side wins this, the people that pick that side
[28:28.320 --> 28:31.780]  will get a unique discord role relating to that side.
[28:32.480 --> 28:33.000]  Oh, wow.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.640]  So so we pick that by by using these reactions at the bottom.
[28:36.780 --> 28:39.140]  So yes, there is a reaction at the bottom.
[28:39.240 --> 28:41.420]  Uh huh. You can pick one. OK.
[28:42.420 --> 28:45.580]  Oh, team Falcon or team Scrump.
[28:45.580 --> 28:47.440]  I'm going team Scrump. Oh, wow.
[28:47.820 --> 28:49.060]  You guys are crazy.
[28:49.500 --> 28:51.160]  You think you don't think Scrump?
[28:51.260 --> 28:54.100]  I, I, people. It's an OG, Scrump's the OG.
[28:54.660 --> 28:55.960]  And it's such an iconic sign.
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.400]  But we're protected by Falcons.
[28:57.400 --> 28:59.540]  A guy like me is protected by Falcons.
[29:01.320 --> 29:02.700]  Oh, Gavin, did you vote?
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.140]  I can't find what you're talking about. OK.
[29:06.620 --> 29:08.260]  Good. What is it?
[29:08.260 --> 29:09.780]  I mean, what? Announcements?
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.980]  What you see at the top podcast announcements and then below it.
[29:13.060 --> 29:14.740]  And then like three things below that.
[29:14.780 --> 29:15.780]  It says the sign vote.
[29:16.260 --> 29:18.120]  Mine's actually above it in suggestions.
[29:18.420 --> 29:19.720]  Oh, it's above it.
[29:20.100 --> 29:22.620]  Oh, weird. Oh, OK.
[29:22.920 --> 29:26.220]  OK. And then you and then it's the whole, hey, it's time.
[29:26.320 --> 29:26.840]  Pick your team.
[29:26.940 --> 29:29.220]  You scroll down below the link and you.
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.700]  There's two places to vote.
[29:30.840 --> 29:33.440]  The Scrumping, or the Falcon. Gavin.
[29:33.640 --> 29:35.080]  I haven't voted yet. I'm away from it.
[29:35.100 --> 29:37.620]  No, Gavin. You're also a Scrump man.
[29:38.080 --> 29:40.300]  Interesting. I'm going to pick Falcon.
[29:41.260 --> 29:42.660]  Interesting. Team Falcon.
[29:43.140 --> 29:46.140]  I was initially on the Scrump side, but I think I might go Falcon.
[29:46.380 --> 29:49.380]  Well, it's a tough thing because Scrump, the no Scrumping is definitely
[29:49.380 --> 29:51.760]  the more iconic, longer lasting thing.
[29:51.920 --> 29:54.720]  But I feel like Falcons have been a lot more relevant recently.
[29:55.200 --> 29:58.960]  I think Falcons have been a lot louder about getting the Falcon signs reprinted, too.
[29:59.220 --> 30:01.380]  I also think I like Scrumping is who we were.
[30:01.540 --> 30:04.120]  It's in our it's in our Apple DNA, obviously.
[30:04.440 --> 30:05.880]  But Falcons are who we are.
[30:06.440 --> 30:07.560]  At least that's how I'm viewing it.
[30:07.720 --> 30:10.960]  Did you see, though, on the podcast
[30:10.960 --> 30:14.640]  where you posted a picture of us with the Falcon that it's not a Falcon?
[30:15.820 --> 30:16.700]  That's what I heard.
[30:17.200 --> 30:18.380]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[30:18.680 --> 30:20.720]  Someone said it's a it's a Harris Hawk.
[30:20.960 --> 30:21.880]  Yeah, that's a Falcon.
[30:22.260 --> 30:23.400]  Produced by Falcons and Hawks.
[30:23.600 --> 30:24.840]  Yeah, you just shorten it to Falcon.
[30:25.140 --> 30:26.440]  It's too long to say the other way.
[30:26.940 --> 30:28.520]  You know that Hudson Hawk was a Falcon.
[30:29.780 --> 30:31.340]  Yeah, everyone knows this.
[30:31.640 --> 30:33.340]  Boy, you can call the movie Hudson Falcon.
[30:33.520 --> 30:35.120]  It doesn't have a ring to it.
[30:35.120 --> 30:36.140]  Well, his name's not Captain Hawk.
[30:36.220 --> 30:36.740]  It's Captain Falcon.
[30:37.080 --> 30:39.440]  Danny Aiello's not signing on to be in Hudson Falcon.
[30:39.560 --> 30:41.020]  He's only signing on to be in Hudson Hawk.
[30:41.360 --> 30:43.640]  Would you rather be protected by Falcons or Hawks, Gavin?
[30:44.120 --> 30:45.560]  Oh, Falcons, I think. Easy.
[30:45.740 --> 30:47.780]  Well, Falcon is a cool name.
[30:48.420 --> 30:49.080]  It is a cool name.
[30:49.600 --> 30:50.880]  And that's why we're protected by them.
[30:50.980 --> 30:52.080]  So we're protected by Falcons.
[30:52.280 --> 30:57.440]  Now, that will also go on sale at the same time as the Gerpler,
[30:57.440 --> 31:00.800]  which is February 14th at 12.
[31:01.100 --> 31:05.060]  That's noon central time at Regulation Store.
[31:05.160 --> 31:06.440]  Hang on. It's what is it?
[31:06.480 --> 31:07.200]  The regulation?
[31:07.540 --> 31:09.200]  Is it Regulation.Store?
[31:09.520 --> 31:10.360]  What? Geoff.Sucks.
[31:13.000 --> 31:14.140]  RegulationStore.com.
[31:14.260 --> 31:15.680]  Thank you. RegulationStore.Store.
[31:15.760 --> 31:16.980]  I went to GeoffSucks.
[31:17.200 --> 31:20.700]  I went to Geoff.Sucks and it took me to a HostGator site.
[31:21.860 --> 31:23.360]  Geoff.Sucks is expired?
[31:24.040 --> 31:25.220]  It might be.
[31:25.700 --> 31:26.980]  No! Give it a try.
[31:26.980 --> 31:28.720]  Oh, God, it doesn't work anymore.
[31:29.620 --> 31:30.760]  Geoff.Sucks. Gavin!
[31:31.540 --> 31:32.860]  Can't lean on this, man.
[31:32.980 --> 31:33.840]  You got to get it.
[31:33.960 --> 31:36.260]  Oh, shit. Did I not pay my bill?
[31:36.780 --> 31:37.460]  Damn it, Gavin.
[31:38.340 --> 31:40.000]  Well, I'll try and get back on that.
[31:40.400 --> 31:43.660]  We'll definitely go to RegulationStore.com then.
[31:44.320 --> 31:45.500]  Well, Gavin gets back on that.
[31:46.420 --> 31:49.820]  I've we often talk about how amazing our community is.
[31:49.940 --> 31:50.680]  I love them.
[31:51.120 --> 31:51.700]  They're so creative.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.260]  Do you see what they did?
[31:53.540 --> 31:56.160]  Do you see what those those those people did?
[31:56.160 --> 31:57.900]  The mischief they've caused?
[31:58.380 --> 31:59.500]  Oh, no.
[31:59.800 --> 32:00.420]  Let me post.
[32:02.320 --> 32:06.920]  It's one of my favorite things about our community is they just do things.
[32:07.140 --> 32:09.600]  They just do things that are really funny and great.
[32:09.920 --> 32:15.100]  And people now, you know, there's a movie that we have some history with.
[32:15.700 --> 32:20.500]  If people go on the IMDb trivia for it, there's a there's a new fun fact
[32:21.120 --> 32:22.460]  on the IMDb trivia page.
[32:22.640 --> 32:25.440]  If you go to the tuxedos trivia page on IMDb,
[32:26.360 --> 32:29.180]  one of the submitted pieces of trivia
[32:30.420 --> 32:34.320]  is the titular tuxedo worn by Jackie Chan was bought at auction
[32:34.320 --> 32:37.400]  by podcaster Andrew Panton in 2022.
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.600]  And it's currently in a pile in Geoff Ramsey's closet.
[32:42.060 --> 32:42.820]  Twelve upvotes.
[32:44.200 --> 32:45.160]  That's so stupid.
[32:45.540 --> 32:49.960]  It made me so happy that the premise that because I whenever I finish a movie,
[32:49.960 --> 32:52.460]  I love to go to the trivia and just kind of like scan it,
[32:52.880 --> 32:54.200]  learn about the movie a little bit.
[32:54.200 --> 32:57.380]  The premise of people doing that
[32:57.380 --> 33:01.220]  and having no concept of what this podcast is and reading that
[33:01.220 --> 33:02.320]  makes me so happy.
[33:02.880 --> 33:06.060]  It is a shame it doesn't mention the podcast by name for a little bit of promo
[33:06.060 --> 33:08.560]  because we could potentially have 12 new listeners there.
[33:08.820 --> 33:09.480]  Oh, shit.
[33:10.600 --> 33:14.440]  It's those wild little moments that just like they just make the podcast
[33:14.440 --> 33:17.220]  not worth it to me because clearly it's worth it,
[33:17.220 --> 33:19.020]  but just make it that much extra special to me.
[33:19.160 --> 33:22.000]  Like there are people out there that have no idea who we are,
[33:22.000 --> 33:26.760]  but they believe a Don Zimmer baseball card is worth more than it used to be.
[33:26.760 --> 33:28.740]  You know, I thought that was pretty great.
[33:28.880 --> 33:31.420]  Yeah, I'll never that'll never not be the coolest thing ever.
[33:31.780 --> 33:34.860]  Yeah. Hey, before we get before we get too far past it.
[33:35.860 --> 33:41.220]  Andrew Gavin made a drawing of your mind table.
[33:41.400 --> 33:41.900]  Yeah. What do you think?
[33:42.200 --> 33:44.400]  You're Andrew's mind table.
[33:46.760 --> 33:48.880]  Way off. It's he's completely wrong.
[33:48.940 --> 33:49.360]  And it's fine.
[33:49.560 --> 33:51.680]  What? Oh, that's exactly what you described.
[33:52.000 --> 33:52.560]  And it's not.
[33:52.680 --> 33:55.000]  Except you spelled Geoff G-E-I-F-F, by the way.
[33:55.340 --> 33:56.020]  Oh, shit.
[33:57.400 --> 34:00.100]  It was so small, I could I could barely read it.
[34:00.680 --> 34:02.520]  What do you mean? That's exactly what you said.
[34:02.820 --> 34:03.880]  That is what you said.
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.560]  No, no, there's.
[34:05.760 --> 34:08.420]  Do you picture a rectangular table and Geoff's on the left?
[34:08.860 --> 34:10.740]  No. What are you talking?
[34:10.800 --> 34:11.480]  You said square.
[34:12.060 --> 34:13.100]  No, this is.
[34:13.100 --> 34:16.740]  I mean, I know that what I perfectly listen to and replicate would be wrong.
[34:17.280 --> 34:20.240]  OK, so let me for the people that can see this image.
[34:22.300 --> 34:24.520]  It's in the go to the YouTube and watch it.
[34:24.620 --> 34:29.220]  Yeah, it's on the YouTube version for the Patriot or the Geoff and Nick are flipped.
[34:29.620 --> 34:31.380]  The fuck we are. I was to your right.
[34:31.480 --> 34:33.300]  You said that. Yeah, you said that.
[34:33.380 --> 34:35.700]  OK, OK, well, I'm trying to correct in the least.
[34:35.960 --> 34:38.060]  OK, so then slide me down.
[34:38.640 --> 34:42.120]  You're right. Based on what I said, I can't believe you fucked that up.
[34:42.120 --> 34:42.780]  No, no, no, no.
[34:42.820 --> 34:44.120]  Based on what I say, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[34:44.160 --> 34:46.040]  Based on what I said, you slide me down.
[34:46.100 --> 34:47.420]  I'm next to Geoff on the court.
[34:47.460 --> 34:49.740]  You're on the where Eric is to Geoff.
[34:49.900 --> 34:50.660]  No, calm down.
[34:50.660 --> 34:52.440]  One second, let's be adults about this.
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.540]  Where Eric is in relation to Nick is where I am on the other side with Geoff.
[34:57.940 --> 35:00.480]  Oh, you just need to scoot the chair to the right a little bit.
[35:00.800 --> 35:02.220]  Yes. Yeah. So I need to scoot down.
[35:03.020 --> 35:04.700]  That's beyond pedantic, dude.
[35:05.040 --> 35:06.420]  Then, Gavin, you got to scoot down.
[35:07.180 --> 35:07.980]  Scoot down where?
[35:08.860 --> 35:10.000]  So you're level with me.
[35:10.420 --> 35:11.600]  So we're with Geoff.
[35:12.280 --> 35:14.620]  And then Eric has to scoot down a little bit.
[35:14.940 --> 35:17.980]  OK, so everyone's on their correct side, but the space.
[35:18.400 --> 35:19.620]  The siding is all correct.
[35:19.700 --> 35:20.900]  Just the positioning is off.
[35:21.040 --> 35:22.640]  Oh, I was completely wrong.
[35:22.880 --> 35:23.940]  This is the craziest.
[35:24.440 --> 35:25.200]  This is Andrew.
[35:25.340 --> 35:26.960]  Andrew, you're a crazy person.
[35:27.160 --> 35:31.220]  Andrew, what you've described is everybody gets as physically far away
[35:31.220 --> 35:32.420]  from Nick as possible.
[35:32.580 --> 35:35.040]  Yeah, Nick is on the other side by himself.
[35:35.780 --> 35:38.180]  No, because we don't know if he's got the monkey mask or not.
[35:38.260 --> 35:39.260]  We need some distance.
[35:39.480 --> 35:41.280]  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[35:41.500 --> 35:43.580]  I can sit closer to Geoff. That's fine.
[35:43.880 --> 35:45.960]  Is there a table curtain maybe Nick sitting behind?
[35:50.100 --> 35:53.880]  I think I think it's pretty clear that I was directly next to Geoff,
[35:53.960 --> 35:55.480]  and that is not at all close to Geoff.
[35:55.740 --> 35:56.860]  You are directly next to Geoff.
[35:56.860 --> 35:58.180]  There's no one between you.
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.300]  That's if if I'm standing in an end zone of a football field
[36:03.300 --> 36:06.980]  and I say there's no one between us and you're at the 50 yard line,
[36:07.100 --> 36:08.180]  you're not next to me.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.720]  It's not it's not to scale this the.
[36:13.320 --> 36:17.160]  If I said sit next to me at the table and you sat there, I'd be like,
[36:17.160 --> 36:18.200]  what's he doing?
[36:18.880 --> 36:19.740]  What do you mean?
[36:20.020 --> 36:21.560]  If I wait, if I sat where?
[36:21.740 --> 36:22.680]  So you're you're blue.
[36:22.800 --> 36:26.840]  If I sat there, Geoff, if I'm sitting where Geoff is and I said,
[36:26.980 --> 36:30.740]  hey, come sit next to me at this table and then you sat where you're sitting
[36:30.740 --> 36:31.560]  in this image.
[36:32.060 --> 36:34.740]  Yeah, I would I would think, what are you doing?
[36:35.120 --> 36:36.340]  I'm sat next to you.
[36:36.420 --> 36:37.780]  No, you're not. You're so far away.
[36:39.860 --> 36:43.840]  If somebody else can sit to your left, you're too far.
[36:46.220 --> 36:49.800]  I want so badly to sit around a table with you all someday.
[36:50.100 --> 36:50.940]  Oh, my God.
[36:51.040 --> 36:52.940]  I can explain it like this with cars.
[36:53.120 --> 36:54.380]  Well, I think about a parking space.
[36:54.460 --> 36:56.040]  I feel like that's pretty standardized sizing.
[36:56.560 --> 37:02.220]  If I say park next to me and you park three spots to my left,
[37:02.260 --> 37:03.460]  that's not next to me.
[37:03.840 --> 37:05.280]  That's three spots to my left.
[37:05.660 --> 37:08.500]  But if a car can park between you and I.
[37:09.320 --> 37:10.440]  You're not next to me.
[37:11.180 --> 37:12.420]  And I don't think that's crazy.
[37:12.420 --> 37:13.940]  I think people agree with me on this one.
[37:14.400 --> 37:15.180]  I don't think so.
[37:15.300 --> 37:15.860]  You don't think so?
[37:16.100 --> 37:16.980]  Well, here's the thing.
[37:17.100 --> 37:19.260]  I'm excited to hear from all of them about it.
[37:19.820 --> 37:22.440]  If you say to somebody, sit next to me.
[37:23.820 --> 37:28.280]  You you can't have space for somebody to become the next to you.
[37:28.300 --> 37:29.660]  All right. I'm redrawing this now.
[37:31.640 --> 37:32.880]  OK, put that there.
[37:33.120 --> 37:35.340]  I don't think when you ask someone to sit next to you,
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.920]  they can be far enough that someone can become the new next to you.
[37:39.100 --> 37:40.360]  It's just a square table.
[37:40.360 --> 37:41.880]  No one sits on a corner.
[37:44.420 --> 37:46.940]  Gavin. OK, I think I got it.
[37:47.200 --> 37:48.300]  Can you fix my fucking name?
[37:48.460 --> 37:49.680]  Yeah, do you know how to spell Geoff's name or no?
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.260]  Yeah, I'll fix that.
[37:52.100 --> 37:54.200]  Put that there.
[37:55.780 --> 37:56.260]  Save.
[37:56.580 --> 37:58.940]  I love that this guy is one of the
[38:00.040 --> 38:03.740]  greatest high speed camera operators in the history of film,
[38:03.800 --> 38:06.460]  and we have them using MS Paint every podcast.
[38:09.860 --> 38:10.520]  It's fine.
[38:11.360 --> 38:12.300]  I'm going to track.
[38:14.100 --> 38:16.480]  Man, Windows 11, a real piece of shit.
[38:16.560 --> 38:17.640]  I don't know why it just sucks.
[38:18.820 --> 38:20.100]  OK, is that the new one?
[38:20.680 --> 38:21.420]  Yeah, it sucks.
[38:21.840 --> 38:22.440]  All right. How's that?
[38:23.200 --> 38:24.760]  That's perfect. That's really good.
[38:25.320 --> 38:27.740]  Oh, it's so wait. So I need to be that high.
[38:28.160 --> 38:29.840]  No, I mean, you should be closer, but it's fine.
[38:29.940 --> 38:32.100]  I thought you said I need to be far away from Nick.
[38:32.480 --> 38:33.360]  Yeah, you do. But that's fine.
[38:33.440 --> 38:35.780]  He put something else like he scratched out the sign.
[38:35.780 --> 38:39.400]  So the Gavin and the Andrew that were clearly violently murdered
[38:39.400 --> 38:41.740]  were those doppelgangers or clones?
[38:42.360 --> 38:43.500]  And something, I don't know.
[38:43.580 --> 38:44.840]  They got a hundred thousand dollars.
[38:45.480 --> 38:46.740]  Yeah, the other one was me.
[38:46.800 --> 38:47.660]  But from the other bull.
[38:48.060 --> 38:52.300]  Oh, dude, my wife remembered what the other hypothetical was
[38:52.300 --> 38:53.640]  when we were in Mexico.
[38:54.060 --> 38:54.840]  What was the hypothetical?
[38:55.080 --> 38:59.700]  Yeah, it was six days a week.
[39:00.500 --> 39:03.440]  You taste with your fingertips.
[39:03.940 --> 39:05.520]  Yeah, you taste buds are on your fingers.
[39:06.180 --> 39:08.100]  Yeah. And it's how much money was it?
[39:08.160 --> 39:10.720]  Like four hundred. Was it like four hundred thousand dollars or something?
[39:11.480 --> 39:12.200]  I don't know.
[39:12.680 --> 39:14.760]  It wasn't that much. It was like a hundred grand.
[39:15.300 --> 39:19.300]  Yeah, but it was it really descended down to wiping your butt would be hard.
[39:19.780 --> 39:22.860]  Yeah. Why does your wife pay more attention to me than you do?
[39:23.380 --> 39:24.900]  Why would I pay attention to you?
[39:25.220 --> 39:27.980]  She has less exposure to you.
[39:28.020 --> 39:30.120]  So the moments hit more memorable.
[39:30.640 --> 39:33.200]  Yeah. She doesn't have to be in a defensive position with you.
[39:33.620 --> 39:35.180]  Yeah, you could try and fight me earlier.
[39:35.420 --> 39:37.200]  Yeah, I thought you said it was my fault.
[39:37.320 --> 39:39.700]  I was I was very ready to be like, you got your mind.
[39:39.960 --> 39:43.620]  But thankfully, in Andrew's mind table, you couldn't be further from me.
[39:43.660 --> 39:44.360]  So I feel safe.
[39:45.740 --> 39:49.440]  Also, he was really like, no, that's not where they need to sit.
[39:49.540 --> 39:50.300]  And then you read through it.
[39:50.340 --> 39:51.440]  He went, that's fine, whatever.
[39:52.700 --> 39:54.140]  Well, he's run out of space.
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.020]  I would do the what is six days you taste with your fingers.
[39:58.080 --> 39:58.560]  Yeah, it's fine.
[39:59.460 --> 40:01.460]  So, oh, really? Yeah.
[40:02.080 --> 40:05.400]  I'd get a little I'd get a little things for my fingers.
[40:05.780 --> 40:08.740]  Every time you shook somebody's hand, it would be like you just made out with.
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.640]  I'm not shaking up. I'm not shaking hands.
[40:10.960 --> 40:12.960]  What would you what would you put on your fingers?
[40:15.160 --> 40:16.320]  Uh, what would I put?
[40:16.380 --> 40:19.060]  What would be like the equivalent of a mouth that would just close them off?
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.640]  Is it the whole finger or is it the tips?
[40:22.020 --> 40:24.520]  It's like your like your fingerprint is your taste buds.
[40:24.640 --> 40:26.460]  OK, sucking doorknobs, I assume.
[40:27.300 --> 40:30.880]  Um. I guess I'd wear a pair of gloves.
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.100]  Yeah. Yeah. So you just so you'd just be tasting.
[40:34.320 --> 40:36.340]  You'd just be tasting gloves all day.
[40:37.440 --> 40:39.560]  Yeah, I guess. I don't think it would be that bad.
[40:39.860 --> 40:42.980]  I would just squirt some frosting in the fingertips of each glove.
[40:43.220 --> 40:45.020]  Oh, that's the move.
[40:45.180 --> 40:49.020]  Oh, what if we try out, see what it feel like by making a tongue glove
[40:49.020 --> 40:51.800]  and we all have to try and wear a tongue glove for an entire meal?
[40:51.980 --> 40:52.740]  That sounds terrible.
[40:53.020 --> 40:54.280]  All right. Let me write this down.
[40:54.280 --> 40:56.980]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:56.980 --> 40:59.440]  You're persuading me. You're making me think away from this.
[40:59.800 --> 41:01.060]  You're persuading me away.
[41:01.980 --> 41:03.120]  Tongue glove sounds terrible.
[41:03.460 --> 41:06.620]  I'm into it and I'm like, that's what you're saying that you would do.
[41:07.080 --> 41:10.260]  I know. That's that's why I'm saying he's persuading me out of this.
[41:10.800 --> 41:17.320]  I think I could fit my tongue down like a extra large thumb on a on a rubber glove.
[41:19.280 --> 41:21.760]  All right, Geoff, write that down and let's see.
[41:22.520 --> 41:24.640]  I don't know what the fuck you just said.
[41:25.000 --> 41:26.620]  I'm trying to think of what make a good tongue glove.
[41:26.680 --> 41:29.140]  And I think a really big suck a glove or some shit.
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.300]  I got one right here. I was looking on Amazon.
[41:31.480 --> 41:34.220]  They exist. Tongue gloves exist? Oh my God.
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.940]  Tongue sleeve. A tongue sleeve?
[41:37.680 --> 41:38.940]  Disposable tongue covers.
[41:39.040 --> 41:39.840]  What are they for?
[41:40.780 --> 41:41.720]  Putting on your tongue.
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.380]  Prevents the tongue from tasting the bitterness of Chinese medicine.
[41:46.340 --> 41:50.460]  Oh, so it's like drink like eating a rhino horn or something.
[41:50.460 --> 41:51.640]  Yeah, I guess so.
[41:52.400 --> 41:54.520]  Well, anyway, we can buy some on Amazon right now.
[41:54.580 --> 41:55.380]  You guys want me to get them?
[41:55.560 --> 41:56.920]  That's why I get them.
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.140]  I hang on.
[41:59.220 --> 42:02.060]  Maybe different ones, because this is usually ships within one to two months.
[42:02.640 --> 42:05.820]  All right. Well, geez, it's in the it's in the notes.
[42:05.980 --> 42:08.020]  Let me write the wow, the thing down.
[42:08.100 --> 42:10.640]  Oh, what? Yeah, I got it on my nose. Crazy. OK.
[42:12.220 --> 42:17.200]  Oh, OK. So just to be clear, you taste the thing, but it doesn't impact you.
[42:18.740 --> 42:20.340]  What does that mean to you?
[42:20.340 --> 42:25.060]  You just said theoretically I would be able to tell if food was poisoned
[42:25.060 --> 42:28.140]  without it impacting me by touch.
[42:28.200 --> 42:31.460]  What is that something you're commonly concerned with?
[42:31.780 --> 42:33.040]  Can you taste poison?
[42:33.400 --> 42:34.860]  Well, like a food poisoning.
[42:35.140 --> 42:39.320]  Like if I if I put my finger on a piece of chicken.
[42:40.800 --> 42:43.740]  You think food poisoning has a taste is what you're saying.
[42:43.940 --> 42:46.120]  Oh, I guess it's texture, isn't it? It's not taste.
[42:46.600 --> 42:48.640]  No, it's more like undercooked.
[42:48.640 --> 42:50.900]  But yeah, yeah, rawness of it.
[42:51.020 --> 42:52.780]  I guess I could just see that. Yeah.
[42:55.140 --> 42:56.320]  Why don't I do that?
[42:56.480 --> 42:56.920]  I should do that.
[42:56.920 --> 43:00.920]  You could you could just like chow down on like spinach and kale
[43:00.920 --> 43:04.500]  and then just stick your hand in a bowl of ice cream and it'd be like
[43:04.500 --> 43:06.200]  you were having the fucking best dessert of your life.
[43:06.760 --> 43:07.460]  That's interesting.
[43:07.860 --> 43:08.880]  You could be like super healthy.
[43:11.780 --> 43:15.940]  Could be a real bone, a real positive in the long run, if you think about it.
[43:16.640 --> 43:19.800]  I guess I need to evaluate how much the chew means to me.
[43:21.240 --> 43:22.940]  You you can still chew.
[43:23.400 --> 43:24.000]  You're still chewing.
[43:24.320 --> 43:25.660]  You still have to eat through your mouth.
[43:26.120 --> 43:28.500]  No. Yeah, but but I'm saying if I
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.020]  I like the snack on a bag of popcorn.
[43:31.380 --> 43:33.840]  If I put my hand in the bag of popcorn,
[43:34.400 --> 43:38.080]  am I just getting the experience of if I would normally be eating the popcorn?
[43:38.360 --> 43:39.720]  No, that'd be like licking popcorn.
[43:39.840 --> 43:41.200]  You could put some in your mouth and chew it.
[43:41.240 --> 43:45.360]  And if you just like rummage the bag with your hand, you probably have the same vibe.
[43:45.360 --> 43:46.600]  I don't like licking it.
[43:47.140 --> 43:49.060]  I don't mind, but you know, I don't like this now.
[43:49.160 --> 43:51.420]  I'm saying I'm going. It's like cucking yourself with food.
[43:51.500 --> 43:52.380]  I don't want it.
[43:55.140 --> 43:55.860]  Food cuck.
[43:56.080 --> 43:57.500]  I don't want a food cuck.
[43:57.980 --> 43:59.500]  Maybe that's a nickname tomorrow.
[43:59.620 --> 44:00.280]  Let me write that down.
[44:00.480 --> 44:00.920]  Food cuck.
[44:02.300 --> 44:04.320]  Wouldn't that just be watching someone eat food?
[44:04.700 --> 44:05.920]  Watching somebody eat your food?
[44:08.880 --> 44:12.240]  Somebody goes into your fridge and eats your food.
[44:13.040 --> 44:14.020]  Well, you watch.
[44:14.500 --> 44:15.960]  You can't do anything about it.
[44:16.760 --> 44:17.920]  You just have to go.
[44:18.120 --> 44:19.020]  Yeah, that's right.
[44:19.100 --> 44:19.840]  Eat that banana.
[44:20.640 --> 44:21.600]  Give it to it.
[44:21.640 --> 44:23.360]  Yeah, chew hard.
[44:25.300 --> 44:27.560]  They're going to empty the whole fridge later.
[44:28.920 --> 44:29.640]  Pop a grape.
[44:33.020 --> 44:33.920]  Speaking of food.
[44:35.020 --> 44:37.960]  I wanted to run something by you guys, if you if you don't mind.
[44:38.280 --> 44:39.200]  I would love to hear something.
[44:39.600 --> 44:43.400]  You know how we're a I would say we're a pretty fruit adjacent podcast.
[44:43.400 --> 44:46.880]  You know, we definitely had our apple phases, but we dip in and out of all kinds of fruit.
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.140]  Hell, we just had a whole fruit taste test last week. Right.
[44:49.260 --> 44:52.160]  So I'm always just kind of thinking about fruit in general
[44:52.580 --> 44:56.340]  and just like elevating fruit because it's good for you.
[44:56.400 --> 44:57.660]  It's like healthy candy.
[44:58.100 --> 45:03.620]  And I want the world to enjoy fruit in the way that I do and that we do. Right.
[45:03.720 --> 45:07.640]  I feel like that's that's a fairly reasonable thing to do.
[45:07.760 --> 45:09.240]  And that's when it hit me.
[45:09.240 --> 45:14.100]  What was the last big like, hey, eat fruit campaign that you remember?
[45:14.300 --> 45:17.440]  Because for me, it's probably an apple a day.
[45:18.580 --> 45:20.420]  Keeps the doctor away, right?
[45:20.780 --> 45:22.720]  Apple a day keeps the doctor away. It's what people say.
[45:22.820 --> 45:24.840]  I feel like it's outlived its usefulness.
[45:25.140 --> 45:26.580]  So I did a little bit of research.
[45:26.780 --> 45:30.620]  What is another thing that an apple a day could keep away? Right.
[45:31.100 --> 45:35.440]  I wanted to pick something that doesn't already exist, that isn't already copywritten,
[45:35.440 --> 45:40.360]  that isn't already something that someone else can stake a claim and say, no, no, no regulation, guys.
[45:40.380 --> 45:42.500]  I already invented the spaghetti bread bowl.
[45:42.860 --> 45:44.000]  You can't have it. Right.
[45:44.440 --> 45:45.900]  I wanted something free and clear.
[45:46.120 --> 45:49.540]  And I wanted something that's scarier than going to the doctor,
[45:49.600 --> 45:51.200]  which is pretty scary for some people.
[45:51.260 --> 45:54.900]  I must admit, I don't relish going to the doctor, but it's 2025. Right.
[45:54.980 --> 45:58.940]  It's like we're not scared by Alfred Hitchcock and movies and the doctor anymore
[45:58.940 --> 46:01.200]  because we've had the last 50 years of horrors.
[46:01.200 --> 46:08.060]  We need to update the fear to something that matters to us in 2025, something that we can leverage.
[46:08.420 --> 46:18.220]  That's why I'd like to introduce to you guys a nationwide, possibly a global wide fruit initiative that we start right here today.
[46:18.520 --> 46:21.800]  An apple a day keeps the fruit demon away.
[46:22.160 --> 46:24.160]  Then we invent a fruit demon.
[46:24.600 --> 46:27.280]  It could be the scariest thing ever invented.
[46:27.280 --> 46:31.600]  We lean into the exorcist, religious horror, but fruit related.
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.700]  I've done intensive Google searching.
[46:34.020 --> 46:36.000]  No one has ever thought of fruit demon before.
[46:36.140 --> 46:37.820]  It's on us. We've got it.
[46:38.100 --> 46:40.820]  We're inventing fruit demon right now in this moment.
[46:40.980 --> 46:43.860]  You can make it as terrifying as humanly possible.
[46:43.900 --> 46:47.800]  And then we scare kids with it and scare them that if they don't eat their apples
[46:47.800 --> 46:51.460]  and if they don't eat their pineapple and if they don't eat their, you know, their peach chunks,
[46:51.460 --> 47:04.160]  the fruit demon is going to come get them at night and like rip all their flesh off or like eat their bones from the inside out while they're still alive or like strip their teeth while they're frozen and they can't move.
[47:04.260 --> 47:09.660]  I don't know. But something truly horrific that pushes people towards eating fruit out of fear.
[47:10.060 --> 47:11.840]  I like it. Yeah.
[47:12.220 --> 47:13.480]  Apple a day keeps the fruit demon away.
[47:13.660 --> 47:15.120]  No, but it can be horrifying.
[47:15.400 --> 47:20.980]  I mean, I think I'm figuring horns, muscles, fucking like super yoked.
[47:20.980 --> 47:29.000]  Probably six, five, six, six, maybe a little bit of maybe some some patchy fur trust fund, probably cloven hooves.
[47:29.160 --> 47:31.440]  I'm thinking maybe winged, maybe not.
[47:31.640 --> 47:32.480]  Could have a pitchfork.
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.180]  Could have something scarier than a pitchfork.
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.240]  Like, I don't know what's scarier than a pitchfork in twenty twenty five stun gun.
[47:39.760 --> 47:41.280]  Right. It could zap you.
[47:41.400 --> 47:45.360]  I don't know, but we can invent a fruit demon amongst the five of us.
[47:45.360 --> 47:54.840]  We have a team of artists and the regulation listeners and the comment leavers that can all lend their creativity to it, because this is a global wide fruit eating initiative.
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.380]  It did. We don't own it.
[47:56.480 --> 47:59.660]  We introduce it to the world and then it becomes a part of the culture.
[48:00.160 --> 48:02.200]  What are the seven deadly sins of fruit eating?
[48:02.720 --> 48:04.680]  You know what? That's a great question, Andrew.
[48:04.700 --> 48:06.600]  And we need to we need to figure out what they are.
[48:06.900 --> 48:11.220]  Well, I'm not saying we need to do it in this moment, but we should we should definitely come up with them.
[48:11.520 --> 48:14.740]  Maybe next episode, why don't we all present our seven deadly fruit sins?
[48:15.260 --> 48:15.800]  Seven deadly fruit sins.
[48:15.800 --> 48:16.740]  What would be an example?
[48:17.560 --> 48:18.020]  Scurvy.
[48:26.950 --> 48:29.950]  Thou shall not peel an orange and leave it uneaten.
[48:30.510 --> 48:33.010]  Yeah. Could you get a scurvy if you wanted to?
[48:33.510 --> 48:35.110]  Yeah. How do you get it?
[48:35.110 --> 48:36.030]  I don't believe in scurvy.
[48:36.830 --> 48:37.670]  It's a pirate's disease.
[48:37.930 --> 48:40.110]  How can I get scurvy?
[48:40.590 --> 48:43.490]  It was like some sort of malnutrition on a boat, right?
[48:43.710 --> 48:47.150]  But yeah, you just don't give yourself any vitamin C for a long period of time.
[48:47.150 --> 48:49.090]  Oh, and you just get it.
[48:49.370 --> 48:50.270]  You don't like...
[48:50.270 --> 48:52.450]  I always mistake gout with scurvy.
[48:53.030 --> 48:54.330]  Very, very different, I think.
[48:54.390 --> 48:55.230]  Very different. But
[48:57.010 --> 48:58.510]  I'm always making that mistake in my head.
[48:58.850 --> 49:00.370]  You know, I'm looking through all my domains.
[49:00.610 --> 49:02.030]  I don't have jeff.sucks.
[49:02.210 --> 49:03.790]  Was it someone in the community did that?
[49:03.990 --> 49:04.750]  No, you didn't.
[49:05.150 --> 49:08.050]  I have regulationstore.com and regulationstore.store.
[49:08.190 --> 49:09.990]  I remember you buying it in the episode.
[49:10.330 --> 49:11.310]  Absolutely did it.
[49:11.670 --> 49:14.010]  How did I did it get like revoked from me?
[49:14.010 --> 49:16.310]  I think it probably expired
[49:16.310 --> 49:17.970]  and then someone else claimed it, I would assume.
[49:18.350 --> 49:20.730]  How would I buy it for like six months?
[49:21.370 --> 49:22.730]  I don't know. Why did you do that?
[49:25.570 --> 49:26.130]  Damn it.
[49:26.510 --> 49:29.210]  Now, if you would have sat closer to me at the table, I would have told you that.
[49:29.230 --> 49:30.350]  Well, I wasn't allowed to hear.
[49:30.870 --> 49:31.870]  No, you're you're on the other.
[49:31.990 --> 49:33.030]  No, never mind.
[49:34.810 --> 49:36.450]  It is now. Positioning works.
[49:37.170 --> 49:37.990]  I gotta be honest with you guys.
[49:37.990 --> 49:40.430]  I'm a little I'm a little worn out after my fruit demon spiel.
[49:40.790 --> 49:41.530]  Eric fruit demon.
[49:41.890 --> 49:42.670]  That's my fruit demon.
[49:42.670 --> 49:43.630]  That's a nice.
[49:43.650 --> 49:44.470]  Did you just draw that?
[49:45.170 --> 49:46.330]  No, no, I didn't draw it.
[49:46.390 --> 49:48.970]  I found I started looking around for demon generators,
[49:49.090 --> 49:51.050]  found one that I liked and then started going nuts.
[49:51.350 --> 49:54.810]  I will say this, dude, there's not much scarier than a demon in a G string.
[49:55.030 --> 49:55.630]  That's terrifying.
[49:56.130 --> 49:59.970]  What what I really like is he's got a bunch of horns that go forward style.
[50:00.530 --> 50:01.470]  Yeah. Yeah.
[50:01.910 --> 50:05.490]  And he's got some like crazy feet like imagine that.
[50:05.510 --> 50:07.950]  And it's like, if you want to see this guy, don't eat fruit.
[50:08.050 --> 50:09.950]  And it's like, I don't want to I don't want to see this guy.
[50:09.950 --> 50:14.930]  If you don't eat fruit, at least like one portion of fruit a day.
[50:15.110 --> 50:19.390]  He could come in in your sleep and suck the marrow out of your bones
[50:19.390 --> 50:20.310]  while you watch.
[50:20.630 --> 50:24.230]  Yep. He'll turn he'll turn he'll turn you into like an orange or something, too.
[50:24.270 --> 50:24.830]  It'll be bad.
[50:25.230 --> 50:26.910]  You know what he eats for fun?
[50:27.650 --> 50:30.450]  Fingernails and toenails off of your body.
[50:30.650 --> 50:34.070]  Like he doesn't like chew them down like a nervous habit.
[50:34.150 --> 50:37.030]  He kills them back and takes them off.
[50:37.190 --> 50:37.990]  Yeah. Yeah.
[50:37.990 --> 50:40.770]  Well, that's why you don't want you don't want the fruit demon.
[50:41.210 --> 50:42.710]  Cosmic Crisp. Yeah.
[50:43.110 --> 50:44.830]  Cosmic Crisp. Get after this.
[50:45.050 --> 50:46.890]  Let let us know. We'll team up. We'll create.
[50:47.050 --> 50:48.590]  This is like an I don't like this.
[50:49.110 --> 50:54.610]  Maybe it's a thing where like every house has to hang a green banana
[50:54.610 --> 50:57.830]  and make sure they eat a piece of fruit before it goes yellow.
[50:58.010 --> 51:00.430]  He's repelled by vitamin C and potassium.
[51:00.890 --> 51:03.270]  Yeah. Oh, mm hmm.
[51:04.730 --> 51:06.050]  Just a scurvy demon.
[51:06.050 --> 51:07.170]  Yep. Yeah,
[51:08.350 --> 51:09.330]  but it's pretty good.
[51:09.550 --> 51:11.130]  I like the scurvy demon scary.
[51:11.310 --> 51:13.490]  Anyway, so let us know what your fruit demon looks like
[51:13.890 --> 51:15.630]  and then like send it in or something.
[51:15.870 --> 51:17.690]  Scurvy demon tripping over banana peels.
[51:18.630 --> 51:21.150]  It's been a while since we've had a new demon in the zeitgeist.
[51:21.230 --> 51:23.670]  I think I think we're really on. Yeah, that's a great point.
[51:24.790 --> 51:26.510]  Because Jack Black was just Satan, right?
[51:26.850 --> 51:27.510]  And that's. Yeah.
[51:28.190 --> 51:31.090]  I'm trying to think of like what the last celebrity demon was.
[51:31.490 --> 51:32.130]  It's like a movie.
[51:32.670 --> 51:35.330]  I even like the South Park devil for a long time.
[51:35.850 --> 51:38.970]  Satan, he was popular as a South Park character.
[51:39.110 --> 51:41.350]  The insidious one. Remember, he was scary.
[51:41.350 --> 51:43.510]  He was like scary, like behind.
[51:43.850 --> 51:44.990]  There were the nun movies.
[51:45.670 --> 51:46.650]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[51:46.850 --> 51:48.830]  Yeah, there's some pretty scary demons in the nun.
[51:49.010 --> 51:50.810]  I think Russell Crowe fought a demon recently.
[51:51.270 --> 51:53.190]  I think that was alcoholism. Yeah.
[51:53.750 --> 51:54.830]  That's the scariest.
[51:55.190 --> 51:58.530]  To me, that's the scariest recent demon because he's hiding.
[51:59.350 --> 52:01.270]  Scary. Oh, the insidious demon.
[52:01.710 --> 52:02.870]  Yeah. Yeah.
[52:03.450 --> 52:04.510]  Is that Darth Maul?
[52:04.510 --> 52:05.770]  Yeah, it's Darth Maul. I think so.
[52:07.090 --> 52:10.370]  I think that's Patrick Wilson being like, they're not making an 18-2.
[52:10.630 --> 52:11.130]  What the fuck?
[52:14.910 --> 52:18.050]  That guy exists to make that face in every film he's in.
[52:18.550 --> 52:19.850]  Yeah. And he's good at it, baby.
[52:20.690 --> 52:22.010]  He's he's real good at it.
[52:22.150 --> 52:22.930]  He is good at it.
[52:23.270 --> 52:25.090]  He's a good actor. He's a great character. I'm making that face.
[52:26.950 --> 52:28.170]  Woo. Gavin, do you have a demon?
[52:29.030 --> 52:30.030]  Do I have a demon?
[52:30.050 --> 52:32.910]  Yeah, because like, I feel like Gavin, this is when Gavin comes in.
[52:32.910 --> 52:35.790]  It's like, oh, you've never heard a bit of the bit of it.
[52:35.790 --> 52:37.370]  And it's some British demon.
[52:37.790 --> 52:40.090]  Yeah. You've never heard of the British cancer demon.
[52:40.530 --> 52:42.110]  I think Gavin's trying to rebuy a domain.
[52:43.070 --> 52:44.330]  No, no. I'll do it after.
[52:44.650 --> 52:45.350]  I play GTA.
[52:46.030 --> 52:46.290]  Nah.
[52:48.530 --> 52:49.870]  Is Robbie Williams your demon?
[52:50.410 --> 52:52.970]  No, I don't think I can't think of a British demon.
[52:53.390 --> 52:54.390]  That's what I'm curious about.
[52:54.470 --> 52:55.550]  I was going to bring that up on the show.
[52:55.710 --> 52:58.830]  Robbie Williams, only popular in the UK, Europe.
[52:58.930 --> 52:59.610]  He's a European guy.
[53:00.650 --> 53:02.130]  Canada has the tragically hip.
[53:02.910 --> 53:04.370]  New Zealand has Dave Dobbin.
[53:04.610 --> 53:09.150]  I'd like to know what people's like, artists, musical artists that are massive,
[53:09.950 --> 53:15.250]  but only in their country or even area, I guess, like a local legend,
[53:15.610 --> 53:20.450]  like regional, regionally, like a regionally massive musical figure.
[53:20.630 --> 53:21.770]  I think those are fun.
[53:22.130 --> 53:23.550]  I bet here it's like a country singer.
[53:24.050 --> 53:24.730]  It's what?
[53:25.810 --> 53:26.810]  A country singer?
[53:26.950 --> 53:28.810]  I think it's I think it's Garth Brooks, isn't it?
[53:29.510 --> 53:30.910]  He'd be more like Oklahoma.
[53:31.090 --> 53:31.870]  I bet he's too popular.
[53:32.470 --> 53:34.330]  I I think here it'd be.
[53:34.730 --> 53:36.170]  Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
[53:36.410 --> 53:37.330]  I got from San Antonio.
[53:37.670 --> 53:38.930]  I I misunderstood.
[53:39.410 --> 53:42.510]  I thought you meant like who's an American that other countries don't know.
[53:42.610 --> 53:43.790]  And I think that's Garth Brooks.
[53:44.190 --> 53:45.330]  That isn't that what we say.
[53:45.950 --> 53:47.890]  That's why other countries don't know Garth Brooks.
[53:48.110 --> 53:50.590]  Maybe I'm too close to make that evaluation for America.
[53:50.910 --> 53:52.950]  I think other countries know who Garth Brooks is.
[53:53.010 --> 53:55.530]  I think they don't necessarily know who George Strait is,
[53:55.630 --> 53:59.270]  who I would argue is as big as Garth Brooks here in America
[53:59.270 --> 54:02.490]  and certainly in Texas, but probably not as well known globally.
[54:02.710 --> 54:05.070]  I really I really do think it's Garth Brooks.
[54:05.630 --> 54:09.030]  Well, I mean, this may be right because I have no idea who that is.
[54:09.330 --> 54:11.590]  See? Yeah, that's a good point.
[54:11.990 --> 54:13.650]  But I'm also an idiot, so I don't.
[54:13.810 --> 54:15.350]  Yeah, but I don't think it's that.
[54:15.490 --> 54:16.250]  I don't think it's that.
[54:16.330 --> 54:18.930]  I think I feel like friends in low places
[54:18.930 --> 54:22.710]  had to be had to have had some sort of presence outside of the US, though.
[54:23.230 --> 54:26.550]  Is there a thing that gives you culture shock more, Gavin,
[54:26.550 --> 54:29.990]  than discussing a like established,
[54:30.270 --> 54:34.050]  like everybody knows figure or somebody who's American
[54:34.050 --> 54:36.390]  and I'm having no idea who they are?
[54:36.470 --> 54:39.950]  Like, to me, that is always it gets the biggest internal reaction for me.
[54:40.150 --> 54:41.290]  Like, how the fuck?
[54:41.630 --> 54:43.410]  It's we truly are different cultures.
[54:43.970 --> 54:46.830]  Well, when there's someone colossally famous and you've never.
[54:46.890 --> 54:49.790]  Yeah, like you just conversationally bring up somebody that, you know,
[54:50.250 --> 54:53.710]  as somebody like as a huge figure and then they have no concept
[54:53.710 --> 54:54.750]  of who you're talking about.
[54:55.550 --> 54:58.870]  Every time it gets me like it's it's so easy to forget.
[54:59.190 --> 55:02.090]  One of my favorite conversations Gavin and I have ever had
[55:02.090 --> 55:06.270]  in the history of our friendship is we were having a very similar conversation
[55:06.270 --> 55:09.450]  where he was telling me there are tons of Americans
[55:09.450 --> 55:12.250]  that are famous in England that you've never heard of.
[55:12.370 --> 55:15.870]  But you'll never be able to show me a Brit
[55:15.870 --> 55:18.290]  who's famous in America that I've never heard of.
[55:18.730 --> 55:22.790]  And the second he said that, I went, OK, I bet I can in two seconds.
[55:22.790 --> 55:24.330]  Showed him a picture of John Oliver.
[55:25.010 --> 55:26.750]  No clue who he was. Never heard of him.
[55:27.890 --> 55:29.170]  Oh, are you serious?
[55:30.410 --> 55:31.550]  Gavin's like, who the fuck is that?
[55:31.610 --> 55:33.230]  And I go, it's John Oliver. He's like, I have no idea.
[55:33.530 --> 55:36.090]  And it's weird to go back now, because now if you watch
[55:36.090 --> 55:38.930]  like a bunch of the stuff I watched as a kid or not as a kid,
[55:38.950 --> 55:42.450]  I guess, like as a teenager, he has like bit parts in everything I ever watch.
[55:42.650 --> 55:46.230]  Amazing. Oh, but never enough to for me to ever know his name.
[55:46.690 --> 55:48.790]  That's so funny for me.
[55:48.850 --> 55:51.950]  It's Terry Fox, like people in America not knowing who Terry Fox is
[55:51.950 --> 55:55.470]  when he's such a established, it'd be like not knowing
[55:56.030 --> 56:00.870]  who Michael Jordan is essentially for America is everywhere.
[56:01.410 --> 56:02.470]  Yeah. Did you make that up?
[56:02.850 --> 56:04.090]  Terry Fox? Yeah.
[56:04.890 --> 56:06.210]  Fictional. Completely fictional.
[56:07.450 --> 56:12.390]  No. Terry Fox is a very established figure that you have to learn about
[56:12.390 --> 56:14.850]  and the currency all over the place.
[56:15.150 --> 56:17.130]  Is he the most beloved Canadian of all time?
[56:17.490 --> 56:19.930]  He has to be. Certainly in your lifetime.
[56:21.010 --> 56:21.930]  Undeniably. Yes.
[56:22.230 --> 56:23.250]  Who's the worst Canadian?
[56:27.850 --> 56:29.230]  We taking me off the list?
[56:31.550 --> 56:32.970]  Am I? Can I be in the top?
[56:33.410 --> 56:35.130]  Am I at the bottom? You're a great Canadian.
[56:35.550 --> 56:36.370]  I got a pardon? OK.
[56:36.890 --> 56:39.690]  Are there are there like Canadian serial killers?
[56:40.530 --> 56:42.430]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a battle on the planet.
[56:42.710 --> 56:43.610]  Yeah, there's a battle.
[56:45.150 --> 56:47.990]  There is one locally, like not that far.
[56:48.130 --> 56:49.690]  I thought maybe he was like uniquely American.
[56:49.690 --> 56:50.250]  I don't know.
[56:51.090 --> 56:53.750]  I googled the worst Canadian and it's just a bunch of names.
[56:53.870 --> 56:54.550]  I don't know.
[56:54.750 --> 56:58.470]  And I don't want to say them because I don't want to be intentionally offensive.
[56:59.610 --> 57:01.410]  Geoff, I did the exact same thing.
[57:01.810 --> 57:04.150]  I don't know. I don't know who they are or why they're mentioned.
[57:04.350 --> 57:04.990]  This guy's name is John.
[57:05.110 --> 57:06.850]  Don't worry about it. You can figure it out.
[57:07.290 --> 57:11.210]  I'm trying to think of fun like one like ones that we like.
[57:11.270 --> 57:12.470]  We don't recognize anymore.
[57:13.410 --> 57:13.930]  Who was that?
[57:14.170 --> 57:16.250]  Who was that crack mayor you guys had for a while?
[57:16.330 --> 57:18.030]  He's dead. Oh, Rob Ford. Yeah, he's dead.
[57:18.030 --> 57:19.010]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:21.550 --> 57:25.130]  There's a there's like a silly time in culture where
[57:26.030 --> 57:27.710]  Justin Bieber was disavowed
[57:28.370 --> 57:31.350]  for a very specific group of people, to be clear.
[57:32.010 --> 57:36.850]  Like if you're like, I'd say like a teenage guy when he was in his baby phase,
[57:36.890 --> 57:39.590]  there's definitely a window where Bieber was not cool.
[57:39.910 --> 57:42.230]  Now he's incredibly cool across the board.
[57:43.110 --> 57:45.790]  I'm trying to think other media figure.
[57:45.790 --> 57:49.890]  Like I don't I'm having a hard time thinking of one that we've completely disowned.
[57:50.470 --> 57:53.470]  I'll get back to you on this because there has to be one.
[57:54.190 --> 57:56.930]  At least it's got to be like a Canadian Geoffrey Dahmer.
[57:57.230 --> 58:00.870]  I'm trying to do in my head is of like is Kevin Sorbo Canadian?
[58:01.190 --> 58:04.530]  Like what? I feel like there's got to be one of those.
[58:05.110 --> 58:08.070]  Brian Adams. I don't know enough about Brian.
[58:08.230 --> 58:09.730]  I don't I think people are fine with.
[58:09.850 --> 58:10.970]  I think he's all right, isn't he?
[58:11.090 --> 58:13.750]  OK, I think Sorbo's from Minnesota.
[58:13.890 --> 58:15.250]  He's from Minnesota. Really?
[58:15.250 --> 58:16.790]  What about Blaine Cain?
[58:17.830 --> 58:19.950]  Was he just exude Canadian to you?
[58:21.090 --> 58:25.650]  I'm just trying to think of like these sort of like C tier actors
[58:25.650 --> 58:26.850]  that seem shitty.
[58:27.310 --> 58:28.070]  Should we do?
[58:29.810 --> 58:32.570]  Kind of you to give Kevin Sorbo a C tier.
[58:32.850 --> 58:34.590]  Yeah, right. That was that's very nice.
[58:34.710 --> 58:35.570]  The highest he's been in years.
[58:36.010 --> 58:38.690]  Should we do a most Canadian Americans draft?
[58:39.270 --> 58:41.490]  Oh, most Canadian Americans.
[58:42.190 --> 58:43.290]  That's very interesting.
[58:43.670 --> 58:44.950]  It's a very interesting one.
[58:44.950 --> 58:47.710]  Obviously, Sorbo would be a great, great.
[58:47.750 --> 58:48.770]  Oh, we don't want him.
[58:49.350 --> 58:53.270]  Can we just pick Canadians who gave up their Canadian citizenship to be Americans?
[58:54.730 --> 58:56.970]  That could be fun as a draft.
[58:58.050 --> 59:01.530]  Yeah, you do it like it could be Nick,
[59:02.090 --> 59:06.170]  Nick, Eric and Geoff on one team, and then Gavin and I as our own teams
[59:06.170 --> 59:09.290]  for different countries and doing like a reassigning of people.
[59:10.230 --> 59:13.850]  But we're on opposite sides of the table, like how we were looking.
[59:13.850 --> 59:15.990]  What if we what if we just did best Canadians?
[59:16.450 --> 59:21.250]  I'm down with a Canadian draft like Jim Carrey, Seth Rogen.
[59:21.530 --> 59:22.870]  We could do it for each country.
[59:22.970 --> 59:25.650]  We could do best Americans, best Canadians, breast Brits.
[59:26.510 --> 59:27.210]  Breast Brits?
[59:27.610 --> 59:31.630]  Breast Brits, Samantha Fox, all the page three girls.
[59:31.850 --> 59:34.790]  Yeah, dude. Breast Brits is going to be just like a way different list.
[59:34.810 --> 59:35.150]  That's all.
[59:35.210 --> 59:37.750]  I'm just going to draft Gavin's childhood wall.
[59:38.190 --> 59:40.070]  Kelly Brook, Katie Price sort of stuff.
[59:40.630 --> 59:41.850]  Whoa, just get dude.
[59:41.970 --> 59:43.950]  Those names were off the rip.
[59:44.290 --> 59:47.110]  Damn. Well, Kelly Brook was on my wall.
[59:48.430 --> 59:49.830]  I was going to say this the other day.
[59:49.850 --> 59:52.410]  If we ever get an office, I think we should have to put those
[59:52.410 --> 59:55.210]  gang posters on somewhere on the wall.
[59:55.550 --> 59:59.570]  So we've got the the lesbians, Kelly Brook, obviously.
[59:59.830 --> 01:00:00.910]  Tattoo. Is that what they were called?
[01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:02.970]  I don't think it was actually tattoo though.
[01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:07.970]  No, it's it's that it's that the the black and white girls kissing poster.
[01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:10.510]  Right. Yeah. Like every dorm room had. Yeah.
[01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:11.630]  So that was an easy one.
[01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:15.310]  I don't think I want that in my my place of work.
[01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.390]  Well, so that's a good point.
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.230]  Gavin's parents don't think he's gay.
[01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:23.730]  As a joke was going to keep up the facade.
[01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:25.090]  Gavin, all of those.
[01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.950]  I was going to send him his wall for Christmas.
[01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.090]  And I did a lot of research.
[01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.630]  And it is not an authorized Kelly Brook poster.
[01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:36.590]  You cannot just find that.
[01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:42.990]  It is the images from a photo shoot she did for Nuts magazine.
[01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:47.150]  But that version of that poster is not like
[01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:50.790]  that was somebody I think just sold that.
[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.730]  Gavin's buying counterfeit merchandise.
[01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:55.230]  No, I got that from the big poster wall at HMV.
[01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:57.410]  Well, it's like you're reading a big book.
[01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.470]  Yeah. Yeah. No, totally.
[01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:04.110]  But that like that doesn't whatever company licensed that for that thing
[01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:05.330]  doesn't exist.
[01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.990]  That poster no longer exists.
[01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:09.030]  Oh, shit. Well, my apologies to Kelly.
[01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:11.930]  And then you had a J-Lo poster, which I had to try to figure out.
[01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:13.650]  That also is an HMV one.
[01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:19.090]  I assume it's in the same category of like that photo exists in multiple ways.
[01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:22.850]  But trying to find the exact specific one you have not easy.
[01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:25.830]  Boy, what am I going to pick for today's thumbnail?
[01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.050]  I have so many options.
[01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:29.670]  I think I'm going to pick the tongue, honestly.
[01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:33.710]  Honestly, for me, I still I vote for that picture of Dan.
[01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.990]  I just think that's like the worst picture of a human man I've ever seen.
[01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.530]  He looks so sad.
[01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.710]  Yeah, he is just he is just really in there, man.
[01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.670]  He must have been spent, you know? Yeah.
[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.390]  All right, we should start wrapping this one up.
[01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.890]  Oh, did we cover everything we were supposed to cover today?
[01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:53.290]  We talked about the Gurplers.
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:55.250]  We talked about the sign drop.
[01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.190]  We talked about how people should join the discord and pick
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:03.190]  if they are scrumpers or falconers.
[01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.270]  And then what happens exactly, Andrew?
[01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.710]  The winning the winning side gets some sort of winning side gets to keep their role.
[01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:12.930]  Yes. OK, so you'll have a special badge on the server, essentially.
[01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:13.850]  That's pretty cool.
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.630]  You better pick right, I guess. Yeah, don't be wrong.
[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:18.910]  Yeah, but the Falcons, maybe?
[01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.830]  No, it's trouble.
[01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.530]  Fuck it up. It's going to be scrumptious.
[01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:22.730]  Are you going to be looking?
[01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:25.430]  You're going to pick fucking scrumper and you're going to be watching Falcons
[01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.130]  chatting away for the rest of their lives.
[01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:29.790]  Yeah, look at the Falcons fly.
[01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:32.290]  Hey, that's my Falcon.
[01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.950]  And you're going to be like, it's not even a falcon, it's a hawk.
[01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:35.990]  Oh, this is stupid.
[01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:37.290]  At least the scrumping was an apple.
[01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.010]  That's good. Gavin, that's how you sound.
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:47.730]  OK, so if Eric currently has the reins, who can reach them?
[01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:49.770]  I can, I can. I just want to take it, Eric.
[01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:50.810]  I'm going to take it for one second.
[01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:51.890]  I'm going to give it back to you.
[01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:55.310]  I definitely, definitely felt like Geoff had the reins.
[01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.650]  I didn't. Oh, well, did it feel like I had the reins?
[01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:00.450]  I'm just listening to what Gavin was saying.
[01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:01.510]  You were talking.
[01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:03.030]  Gavin told me you had them.
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:05.350]  What am I holding?
[01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:07.510]  Wait, Geoff has the reins.
[01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:08.610]  Wait, Geoff does have...
[01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:09.070]  What am I...
[01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:10.810]  This is such a good show.
[01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:14.430]  No, why don't we try to do a whole episode where you can only talk
[01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:18.030]  if you can take it from the person next to you.
[01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:22.310]  So, Andrew, you can only talk if Eric or Geoff just talked.
[01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.050]  See, now Nick and Geoff are both laughing, so I could talk.
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:36.890]  Well, there you have it, another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:41.930]  Will we do an episode where you can only talk if the adjacent person next to you is speaking?
[01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.950]  I have a feeling we'll probably forget about that immediately, but maybe we won't.
[01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.230]  We might actually do it.
[01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:50.610]  Maybe it'll become the most popular thing we've ever done and we'll do it monthly.
[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:54.530]  Maybe it's the new Sloppy Joe's bingo, which, by the way, we should schedule
[01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:56.390]  and do sometime soon because it's been a minute.
[01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:57.950]  Thanks for listening.
[01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:58.890]  We love you.
[01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:01.030]  Rate and review and subscribe.
[01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:02.670]  Join our Discord.
[01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.690]  Join our YouTube channels.
[01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:05.490]  We have two.
[01:04:05.590 --> 01:04:06.570]  They are also free.
[01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:10.110]  One for the Regulation Podcast, one for Regulation Gameplay.
[01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:11.630]  Andrew, you sound like you'd like the reins.
[01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.170]  Let me go ahead and turn them over to you.
[01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.790]  Oh, there he is.
[01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:15.090]  You were sitting next to each other, right?
[01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.830]  Yeah, I think, you know, it could be interesting for this
[01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:20.430]  to work with the talking thing as we just do the order
[01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:22.990]  in which we've joined in our call on Discord.
[01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:26.690]  So once I finish talking, then Eric can talk.
[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:31.330]  Yeah, it doesn't have to be different from the the mind table.
[01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:35.690]  Well, it's just a visual representation and it goes up and down.
[01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:37.730]  All right, let's try and do that for the outro.
[01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.970]  OK, well, thank you so much for listening.
[01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:47.330]  I think it has to be Eric next.
[01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:47.930]  Yeah.
[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.390]  I was told I don't have to talk.
[01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.330]  I think you have to.
[01:04:52.690 --> 01:04:54.130]  How do I know if I'm allowed to talk?
[01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.230]  We fucked up the line.
[01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:55.930]  It's already fucked up.
[01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.550]  No, you just said.
[01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:57.410]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:57.650 --> 01:05:00.370]  I'm going to go, then Eric's going to go, then Gavin's going to go.
[01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:02.330]  Then Geoff's going to go, then Nick's going to go.
[01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:03.630]  And we're ending it too.
[01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:05.310]  You don't have the reins. I have the reins.
[01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:07.290]  Now you have the reins.
[01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:09.510]  But now you're done because now I'm talking.
[01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.870]  So now Gavin can do it.
[01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:12.310]  Yoink! Shut up, Eric.
[01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.630]  And that's it for another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:18.870]  One last thing, before I turn it over to Nick, who takes us out,
[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:22.850]  he's going to do it live, go ahead and send us in your mind table.
[01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:26.350]  I'd love to know what the podcast seating arrangement looks like in your head.
[01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.890]  That's it for Geoff. Nick?
[01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:34.690]  No one knows what order this is. Like, they never see this part.
[01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:37.370]  That could have to be Andrew. It flips back to Andrew.
[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.370]  It's alphabetical!
[01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:39.250]  What?
[01:05:40.410 --> 01:05:41.390]  Oh, it is alphabetical.
[01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:44.190]  Oh, I never noticed that.
[01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:46.050]  It's eggs.
[01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.810]  It is, it's eggs.
[01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:52.550]  Alright, see you next time, bye!
[01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:53.450]  See you next time, love you, bye!
