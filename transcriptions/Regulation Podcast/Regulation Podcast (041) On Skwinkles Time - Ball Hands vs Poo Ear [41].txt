[00:00.000 --> 00:04.480]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 41. My
[00:04.480 --> 00:08.600]  name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always, Eric Baudour, Nick Schwartz, Gavin Free, Andrew
[00:08.600 --> 00:14.520]  Panton. We all have new nicknames and we are sitting on our nicknames because we can't
[00:14.520 --> 00:19.220]  use them until the nickname draft comes out. But I'm dying to say everybody's new names
[00:19.220 --> 00:24.200]  at the start of the episode. That'll be next week, by the way. The 23rd is when the nickname
[00:24.200 --> 00:28.940]  draft comes out, by the way. Thank you. Geoff and myself and Andrew are all using our nicknames
[00:28.940 --> 00:34.220]  in Slack there. Yeah, we are. We sure are. Partially so I don't forget what mine is.
[00:35.820 --> 00:40.840]  Yours is unforgettable, man. I think yours is great. Yours so describes you too. I feel
[00:40.840 --> 00:44.280]  so good about it. It sure does. Yeah, no, it's good. I'm not, you know, not revealing
[00:44.280 --> 00:48.980]  anything. But yeah, excited for nicknames. I'm excited, excited for that draft to come
[00:48.980 --> 00:54.660]  out and for the audience to see the process and see where we arrived and what nicknames
[00:54.660 --> 00:59.460]  almost made it but didn't quite get there. There were some good ones. Eric particularly
[00:59.460 --> 01:03.640]  had a bunch of really good ones. No, I don't know why you and Emily are pushing that one
[01:03.640 --> 01:07.880]  so hard. Yeah, right. How come you didn't like that? It's like the worst one on the
[01:07.880 --> 01:12.680]  whole board. Like what? Like, you're insane. Well, it's you know, nicknames often the opposite
[01:12.680 --> 01:18.020]  of a person, you know, like tiny for a big guy. Hey, did I have homework for this episode?
[01:18.780 --> 01:23.080]  We were going to get into the mind table again because you left us so flummoxed last time.
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.420]  I don't remember what we're going to get into, though. Does anyone remember the specifics?
[01:28.060 --> 01:32.860]  Is this like, are you baiting us somewhere? No, I just because Eric said we should start
[01:32.860 --> 01:40.640]  with the thing. And I was curious if you guys remembered what the thing was, because I remember
[01:40.640 --> 01:45.840]  being like, oh, we'll continue this next time. But I was real heated and on edge at that time.
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.380]  But I don't remember what the edge was that I was on. The last specific homework I remember
[01:51.380 --> 01:55.060]  is we were supposed to come up with seven deadly fruit sins. Got them. But I don't think
[01:55.060 --> 01:59.280]  we ever did. I think Andrew and nobody else did. But I do vaguely remember what Eric's
[01:59.280 --> 02:03.340]  saying about about leading with the mind table and you clearing stuff up. I just can't
[02:03.340 --> 02:07.340]  remember how that. Yeah, I was going to do something. I think I think you were just going
[02:07.340 --> 02:11.280]  to clear things up because the drawings that you gave us were the worst drawings in history.
[02:11.280 --> 02:15.040]  So we made you redo the first one. And the second one was somehow worse. Yeah, I think
[02:15.040 --> 02:18.000]  you were complaining that you didn't have enough time to properly do the mind table.
[02:18.520 --> 02:24.620]  Right. I think so. I think that's right. You've had a week. I have. But on squinkles time,
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.740]  that means I'm only halfway to what I need to actually get it done. So I got plenty of
[02:30.740 --> 02:39.200]  schedule. Just laying on out there. Dude, that was pretty good. Did squinkles just become
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.120]  a unit of time? I think it's two weeks. I think a squinkle is a two week time period.
[02:44.120 --> 02:51.260]  It's squinkling like you procrastinate constantly. You just never deliver. I don't think procrastinate
[02:51.260 --> 02:56.780]  is the right word. I did the wrong homework. I was so wrapped up because I brought up before
[02:56.780 --> 03:02.540]  we recorded last episode, isn't there homework we're supposed to do? And then we were all like,
[03:02.580 --> 03:07.740]  I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't remember. And then at the end of last episode, Geoff said,
[03:07.880 --> 03:11.380]  oh, there's homework we're supposed to do. And then I panic because I thought,
[03:11.380 --> 03:17.100]  you're right. There was. What was it? I didn't do it. Shit. What was it? So then I prepared this
[03:17.100 --> 03:21.620]  episode for that homework. But now that we're here, I think there was other homework I was
[03:21.620 --> 03:27.940]  supposed to do from the previous episode. So I'm clearing up two episodes worth of homework or two
[03:27.940 --> 03:32.160]  episodes ago's homework. But I think I still have homework from last episode. All right,
[03:32.160 --> 03:36.140]  hit us with it. I'm the only one fruit since apparently I thought Geoff would have it because
[03:36.140 --> 03:41.540]  he did drop. I have my seven deadly fruit sins. You have your fruit sins? He already said he had
[03:41.540 --> 03:47.560]  his fruit sins. Shall we go through our fruit sin? Well, first, did you do a fruit demon? Well,
[03:47.580 --> 03:55.840]  I'm not an artist. Well, that has never stopped us before. I designed the idea of the fruit demon.
[03:56.140 --> 04:03.500]  I feel like that's enough. I drew up a fruit demon. I had my fruit demon and my fruit sins.
[04:04.280 --> 04:10.560]  We're going to put in my fruit demon and then I'm going to post a minute. Do you guys see
[04:10.560 --> 04:16.800]  the insanely good fan art fruit demon? I mean, there's been some great fruit demons, but
[04:16.800 --> 04:23.060]  the one that looked like it was from like a devil, like a book, like a satanist novel.
[04:23.320 --> 04:30.680]  I want to see a satanist novel. Please let me. I saw the best one I've seen so far is the one who
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.420]  had bananas as horns, which is the funniest idea on earth to me. I'm going to post it on
[04:36.420 --> 04:42.400]  the internet. Let me find out who wrote it or who made this, because it's fantastic art.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.480]  While you're doing that, am I crazy or did I see a screenshot of an ex or Twitter,
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.740]  whatever the fuck you call it, where Granny Smith Apples shouted out the fruit demon?
[04:54.540 --> 04:58.660]  Did anybody else see that? No. I should have saved it when I saw it. It was in a thread somewhere.
[04:58.660 --> 05:01.420]  Wait, you saw Granny Smith shout out the fruit demon?
[05:03.340 --> 05:07.760]  That's not a real account. It's just somebody made it. It has like two followers, I think.
[05:07.900 --> 05:11.980]  Ah, see, so he knew it. I didn't know it. I just, I think I've seen that Granny Smith
[05:11.980 --> 05:17.040]  account before. An apple a day keeps the scurvy demon away. Someone made that in our community.
[05:17.880 --> 05:24.380]  Oh, he's got like a fruit tail. Got the nose scrumping on the ground. It's like one of those
[05:24.380 --> 05:30.760]  line cut or like woodcut drawings. Yeah, that's great. I was so impressed by that. I looked at
[05:30.760 --> 05:35.400]  that and I went like, oh, that's funny. Somebody pulled something like someone had a reference
[05:35.400 --> 05:40.040]  point to that and then realizing, no, someone just drew that. That's really impressive.
[05:41.700 --> 05:44.860]  There's the one with the penis. Oh, and Eric just shared one by someone named Lindor.
[05:45.260 --> 05:49.840]  Yeah, this one was so... I love his stupid little cat face. He's got like his funny little teeth,
[05:49.840 --> 05:56.480]  but he's got the like the regulation asterisks on his forehead. But then he also has Geoff's banana
[05:56.940 --> 06:00.620]  with the strawberry on the end in his hand. I think it's so good.
[06:01.220 --> 06:06.280]  Little red rocket fruit. I believe the one I posted was from someone named Tristan Tzaris.
[06:06.820 --> 06:11.840]  These are great. Let me show you my fruit demon. I thought we'd all have fruit demons,
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.060]  but that's OK. I'll show up with mine. I can quickly find my fruit demon. Yeah,
[06:16.060 --> 06:21.440]  figure out your fruit demon. I'll post mine. My fruit demon. His name is vitamin D for death
[06:21.960 --> 06:30.960]  and demon. Here we go. This is my fruit demon. So it is for people that are just listening.
[06:31.500 --> 06:39.640]  He has strawberry legs and the stems go up into a body of like a coconut. And then he's got orange
[06:39.640 --> 06:44.740]  slices for hands. And it's very drippy. He drips everywhere. Everywhere he goes, he's leaving a
[06:44.740 --> 06:50.600]  little juice. Then he's got a banana head and two cherry eyes and really difficult to do something
[06:50.600 --> 06:56.960]  small. But it was supposed to be like a grapefruit mouth. And he's going to get you. So now that's a
[06:56.960 --> 07:00.880]  what kind of body is that again? It looks like a pear, but you said it was a pear, coconut,
[07:00.960 --> 07:06.560]  whatever you want, any greenish kind of fruit thing. I honestly don't remember what I was
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.280]  initially going for, but it doesn't look like whatever it was. So whatever you interpret it
[07:11.280 --> 07:18.100]  is the correct answer for the body. I really like how the cherry stems are also the eyebrows.
[07:18.520 --> 07:22.800]  I thought that I think that's very clever. Creative vision. You could tell it looks like
[07:22.800 --> 07:29.140]  somebody has spilled a thing of Welch's juice and you know he's there. You know, he killed somebody.
[07:29.820 --> 07:34.700]  Scene of the crime. A citrus death. You're like, the floor is sticky. He's been here.
[07:35.280 --> 07:36.820]  You hear you hear the.
[07:38.740 --> 07:39.480]  Walks around.
[07:41.660 --> 07:47.060]  And what do you do to summon him? It could be any of these sins. I have my sins. I'll read mine and
[07:47.060 --> 07:50.320]  then Geoff, do you want to read yours? Yeah, sure. We'll see if you have any any crossover. I'm sure.
[07:50.900 --> 07:59.320]  Uh, the first sin. Poison. Mixing alcohol in the juice. It's a juice sin. Okay. Number two. Excess.
[08:00.300 --> 08:04.040]  Blending too many fruits at once. Too large of a variety.
[08:04.780 --> 08:12.260]  Don't like it. Number three. Negligence. Letting your fruit ripen and then rot and just not using
[08:12.260 --> 08:20.660]  it at all. Number four. Ignorance. Ignoring lemonade stands. You have to use them. You have
[08:20.660 --> 08:27.440]  to utilize. What are you doing? It's hot. Is that ignorance? Yeah. Yeah. Being ignorant. Go to that stand.
[08:29.100 --> 08:36.360]  Squander. Not composting. You gotta reuse the fruit to make more fruit. It's a cycle.
[08:36.360 --> 08:41.720]  Yeah, but if you're not allowed to let your fruit rot because it's a sin, how are you ever gonna...
[08:41.720 --> 08:48.980]  Well, you eat the apple and there's a core, you fuck. There's leftover fruit sometimes and fruit.
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.420]  You don't eat all of the fruit always. There's a peel. You dunce.
[08:55.580 --> 09:01.960]  Next question. Not a question. It's a sin. Erasure. You can edit out my flub, Nick.
[09:02.780 --> 09:10.880]  Removing any fruit trees. And lastly, but not least, defile. To peel without taste.
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.000]  Peeling a fruit and then just leaving it out. Not eating it. Wasting it. And those are the
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.700]  seven sins. Poison, excess, negligence, ignorance, squander, erasure, and defile.
[09:24.040 --> 09:29.680]  That's really... that's wild, dude. We didn't cross over at all. Hell yeah. We had slightly
[09:29.680 --> 09:40.100]  different takes. You went with the more, I guess, religious interpretation with the single sin word.
[09:40.220 --> 09:46.000]  I went for just actions that don't have a catchy phrase. But here are my seven deadly fruit sins.
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.640]  The first deadly fruit sin, not washing a fruit before you eat it. You gotta wash it. It's got
[09:51.640 --> 09:56.480]  dirt on it. It's got pesticides on it. That's so good. Wash your fucking fruit. The second deadly
[09:56.480 --> 09:59.640]  sin, you'd think it'd be the first, but it's not because I didn't write it down, for scrumping.
[09:59.900 --> 10:08.640]  Don't steal. We don't scrump fruit. Third deadly sin, eating unripe fruit. It's not ready for you,
[10:09.220 --> 10:13.100]  green banana. You're taking... you're stealing its thunder away. And it only gets...
[10:13.820 --> 10:17.060]  think about it this way. Fruit only gets one shot at being ripe.
[10:18.260 --> 10:24.000]  Wow. Don't take it away from the fruit. Number four. And I've seen this done a lot. I don't like
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.360]  it. It creeps me out. It's unnecessary. It's stupid. And it kind of goes with number five.
[10:29.600 --> 10:34.700]  Don't peel a grape. You don't peel grapes before you eat them. That's ridiculous. It makes like
[10:34.700 --> 10:41.180]  little brainy eyeballs. Nobody wants to eat that. No. Number five, do peel a banana. That's right.
[10:41.200 --> 10:46.620]  It is a deadly sin to eat a banana without peeling it first. You will not enjoy bananas that way.
[10:46.620 --> 10:52.660]  So don't do it. Number six. If everybody doesn't know this, you should... citrus does not go in
[10:52.660 --> 10:57.460]  the fridge. Leave it out. Oh, interesting. Citrus got to stay out. Leave it on the counter. You don't
[10:57.460 --> 11:02.780]  want to put your oranges in the fridge. Yeah. And number seven. The seventh deadliest sin.
[11:03.820 --> 11:10.260]  Cranberry is only a garnish. Do not eat it as a main course. Yeah. No, definitely. I definitely
[11:10.260 --> 11:14.600]  agree with that. A hundred percent. Yeah. Those are great, Geoff. There you go. Those are my seven
[11:14.600 --> 11:22.320]  fruit sins. Okay, now Gavin, it's your turn. Your sins. Well, I was finding it weird that the sin
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.940]  about storing citrus in the fridge is a valid sin. I agree with it. But the juice from all the citrus
[11:27.940 --> 11:32.480]  has to go in the fridge. That is true. Yeah, but we're not doing... these aren't juice sins.
[11:32.860 --> 11:36.860]  No, these are fruit sins. I don't have any fruit sins. Do you want to see my fruit demon?
[11:37.260 --> 11:39.620]  Yes. I would love to see a fruit demon. Bam.
[11:42.480 --> 11:49.240]  It's a screenshot of a sledgehammer. It's Pierre Gabriel being surrounded by the
[11:49.240 --> 11:53.780]  stop motion fruit from the Sledgehammer music video. Legendary music video.
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.720]  Haven't seen it. Absolutely. Maybe one of the best of all time. It's definitely up there.
[12:01.380 --> 12:05.640]  He like becomes a roller coaster. He's on a roller coaster. That's a good part.
[12:05.640 --> 12:09.180]  The roller coaster kind of drives... oh, the train drives around his face for a bit, doesn't it?
[12:09.240 --> 12:14.060]  Right. Yeah. There's also a good bit where his hands... his fists become sledgehammers and he
[12:14.060 --> 12:21.020]  punches himself in the face. So Peter Gabriel is the fruit demon? In my opinion, he... I like it.
[12:21.060 --> 12:26.980]  He is and always has been the fruit demon. Saying stuff like, open up your fruit cage.
[12:28.220 --> 12:33.300]  Is that what Peter Gabriel looks like?
[12:33.760 --> 12:40.460]  Well, not anymore. Not anymore. That's what he used to look like. Yeah, I assume. I just am
[12:40.460 --> 12:46.160]  realizing I've never seen Peter Gabriel. He's strictly a name I've heard. Oh, he was, I think,
[12:46.200 --> 12:51.220]  pretty dreamy looking dude back in the day. Certainly to Gavin. I think he was fine looking.
[12:52.520 --> 12:55.380]  Now he looks... now he just looks pissed off all the time.
[12:56.960 --> 13:00.700]  He looks... he's holding the mic out accusatorily in that photo that I just sent.
[13:00.700 --> 13:04.900]  Like, he's like, you did this. Oh, man. He looks like evil Billy Joel.
[13:05.480 --> 13:07.680]  He looks like a falconer. Open up your what?
[13:09.480 --> 13:12.800]  What? What? What? I thought... Gavin, I thought it was funny.
[13:14.940 --> 13:20.280]  That's how he used to look. Yeah, he's all right, isn't he? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Dreamy he is,
[13:20.380 --> 13:25.680]  according to Gavin. Yeah. He's British dreamy. Do you think it's a different kind of dreamy?
[13:25.680 --> 13:30.800]  Well, 100%. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Softer. Softer dreamy is British dreamy.
[13:31.100 --> 13:34.640]  Different features. A lot of people in the audience, based on last week's episode,
[13:35.740 --> 13:42.040]  thought that with my ball knuckling idea, that I thought piss was stored in the balls.
[13:43.660 --> 13:46.980]  And I just want to let everyone know that I know it's not stored in the balls.
[13:50.260 --> 13:54.880]  I think everyone knows it's not stored in the balls because the amount of piss that comes out
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.180]  is maybe five to six times the volume of my balls. Very obvious. But I have drawn a diagram.
[14:00.440 --> 14:08.080]  Oh, my God. Just letting everyone know I mean to knuckle right here. And you see the urinary tract
[14:09.040 --> 14:13.040]  kind of curves down a little bit of a drip loop going on. You just want to knuckle that bit,
[14:13.080 --> 14:16.520]  that fold bit, and it just pushes out some extra drips. So just get in there.
[14:16.660 --> 14:21.460]  Is that your doody right there? Where? It looks like a big brown long turd.
[14:21.460 --> 14:26.260]  It's a huge, huge log right next to your balls, dude.
[14:26.320 --> 14:31.260]  Oh, my God. Did you add the CPAP error? I may have added a label.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.980]  I didn't expect you to notice that, I'll be honest.
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.600]  What I appreciate about this is it started with Gavin addressing the fact that people thought he
[14:42.600 --> 14:47.660]  didn't know anything about how this works. And Gavin is really arguing that he knows way more
[14:47.660 --> 14:54.540]  than everybody else does. And here is an anatomic image to display how it would function
[14:54.540 --> 14:59.160]  within how the body actually works. Well, I know that it works based on
[14:59.160 --> 15:04.080]  doing it. So I looked up the image of where the piss tube goes and I was like,
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.440]  oh, it makes sense that it works because the piss tube... You knuckle your balls?
[15:09.800 --> 15:15.420]  No. No, I'm... You just said I know it works because I've done it.
[15:15.420 --> 15:18.960]  Well, I mean, I've prodded that area. What does that mean?
[15:19.200 --> 15:21.400]  I've not used my knuckles to do it, but I have like...
[15:22.680 --> 15:27.060]  But why not your knuckles? It says knuckle here.
[15:27.440 --> 15:29.020]  Well, the angles are all wrong for a knuckle.
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.160]  These three ninjas are about to knuckle up on Gavin.
[15:36.820 --> 15:38.580]  Why are they knuckling up with their shoes?
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.080]  I don't know. You're talking about knuckling up and then saying you haven't done it or whatever,
[15:43.080 --> 15:44.780]  man. You've done it, but you haven't done it?
[15:44.920 --> 15:46.300]  You've done it, but you haven't done it.
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.200]  No, I've put pressure there to see if it gets some drips out and it does.
[15:50.300 --> 15:55.720]  But I've not used my knuckle because I don't think I can get my whole fist down back there.
[15:56.240 --> 16:02.260]  What if we invent some sort of a plastic handheld knuckle that a guy can use in an event like this?
[16:02.340 --> 16:02.960]  I don't want to.
[16:03.160 --> 16:06.940]  Like a little back scratcher, but for bollock knuckling, like maybe hooked around?
[16:07.320 --> 16:11.960]  Yeah, like a hooked around back scratcher that's a knuckler, like a tube knuckler.
[16:13.140 --> 16:17.660]  I just, I feel like Gavin suggested this in a way that was very hypothetical last week,
[16:17.760 --> 16:20.120]  and now it sounds like he's been doing this for years.
[16:20.600 --> 16:23.820]  I know, I've not been doing it for years. I just, like, sometimes you want to move the
[16:23.820 --> 16:27.300]  balls around a little bit to get the drips out. And I'm saying it because it's putting...
[16:27.300 --> 16:28.720]  The balls where the pee's not stored.
[16:29.460 --> 16:33.880]  The balls where the pee's are not stored, yeah. And the piss, you can also shake your penis,
[16:34.080 --> 16:38.940]  which is also where the pee isn't stored. But it still gets drips out. You don't have to...
[16:38.940 --> 16:41.080]  I don't like the way you said that.
[16:41.340 --> 16:41.460]  Yeah.
[16:41.460 --> 16:41.900]  Why not?
[16:42.580 --> 16:45.920]  I don't think I've ever peed and thought I got to move the balls around.
[16:46.980 --> 16:50.840]  I'm surprised that I really like the way he said it. I kind of want him to say it again a few more
[16:50.840 --> 16:54.660]  times. So Andrew, you've pissed, right? And then you...
[16:54.660 --> 16:55.320]  Yeah, I have.
[16:55.440 --> 16:57.280]  Just pull your boxes up. Tons.
[16:57.720 --> 16:59.260]  It was something. You ever pissed?
[16:59.960 --> 17:02.940]  You don't ever give the whole package a little shake just to get the...
[17:02.940 --> 17:06.140]  You won't believe this. Today. I did it today. Sorry, continue.
[17:06.740 --> 17:10.800]  So you finish pissing, you know, the last drips come out, and then what? You just pull up your
[17:10.800 --> 17:11.140]  boxes?
[17:11.600 --> 17:17.260]  I mean, I might do like shake, but I'm not fucking knuckling underneath my body and...
[17:17.260 --> 17:20.220]  Because you don't have the patented regulation tube knuckler.
[17:20.240 --> 17:24.240]  And here's the thing. It's like breathing. I don't necessarily think about the shake.
[17:24.480 --> 17:27.720]  I've never went like, oh, man, I got to do something with the balls.
[17:28.200 --> 17:32.140]  The balls are like you're putting more thought into the pee than I ever have.
[17:32.340 --> 17:33.020]  It's all connected.
[17:33.200 --> 17:33.740]  Hey, Gav.
[17:34.080 --> 17:34.260]  Yeah.
[17:34.640 --> 17:38.620]  It's useless to explain this to him because he's too young to have experienced it.
[17:39.220 --> 17:39.660]  He's too young.
[17:39.660 --> 17:43.600]  And then he'll have his his like light bulb moment and he'll go,
[17:44.120 --> 17:48.000]  oh, fuck. Now I know piss kung fu. I get what they were talking about.
[17:48.140 --> 17:51.060]  Well, I mean, Eric's becoming a bit of an old codger. What about you, Eric?
[17:51.120 --> 17:54.000]  Do you ever move stuff around and get the last drips out?
[17:54.320 --> 17:56.520]  Yeah, I mean, you got you got to like squeeze a little bit,
[17:56.560 --> 17:58.920]  but I just kind of like do that internally and I feel fine.
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.800]  I just don't when you talk about like grabbing your balls to shake them around to get piss out.
[18:04.980 --> 18:07.320]  I like I think I know what you're saying,
[18:07.320 --> 18:10.440]  but the way you're sort of like lodging this is so bizarre.
[18:10.440 --> 18:13.360]  I'm not jingling it around like a purse of coins.
[18:13.620 --> 18:17.820]  I mean, you're talking about you just you. The other thing you said was shake your penis.
[18:17.940 --> 18:21.200]  So I just don't like the whole thing you're talking about is like,
[18:21.480 --> 18:23.840]  I don't know. And then you like want to speed bag it.
[18:23.900 --> 18:25.900]  I don't I just don't understand any of this, man.
[18:26.240 --> 18:32.280]  I just am now visualizing Gavin with his long arm.
[18:32.280 --> 18:34.360]  I'm assuming you have long arms in my head.
[18:35.760 --> 18:38.180]  Fucking crouch like King Louie.
[18:38.240 --> 18:39.440]  I will did do.
[18:41.280 --> 18:44.880]  Crouch like King Louie, just knuckle in your balls.
[18:47.680 --> 18:53.220]  Look, look, it's very hard for me to explain what I do without showing you my penis and testicles.
[18:53.520 --> 18:54.700]  But what I'm doing is...
[18:54.700 --> 18:55.120]  Seen it.
[18:56.960 --> 19:01.240]  I'm really just shaking the old cock a little bit and then maybe lifting
[19:01.240 --> 19:04.960]  the balls, getting a finger behind the balls and just lifting up.
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.940]  And then some extra drips come out.
[19:07.280 --> 19:09.840]  I yeah, once again, I get it.
[19:09.840 --> 19:12.280]  I think I understand. And you just keep explaining it.
[19:12.320 --> 19:15.140]  It's the finger around the balls. That's crazy.
[19:15.840 --> 19:19.460]  There might be the middle finger just as the balls are getting pushed.
[19:19.600 --> 19:22.260]  The middle fingers may be just going behind the balls and pushing.
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.040]  And then I thoroughly wash my hands.
[19:25.120 --> 19:28.260]  Do you hold the balls like you're displaying a fine necklace,
[19:28.260 --> 19:33.720]  like in a movie when they're selling jewelry and there's like the palm and extend it out?
[19:36.640 --> 19:39.680]  I'm so sorry, Gavin. I'm so on board with you, right?
[19:39.760 --> 19:43.320]  And you did a terrible job of explaining it, but you're 100% right.
[19:46.400 --> 19:51.580]  The bottom line is the older you get, the longer and harder it is to get the pee out of you.
[19:51.800 --> 19:55.120]  Yeah, and it only gets more complicated with every year.
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.440]  And I feel like I could keep flexing and squeezing internally like Eric,
[19:58.540 --> 20:00.160]  but it's just so much slower.
[20:00.380 --> 20:03.040]  Okay, stop posting pictures of King Louis.
[20:05.220 --> 20:07.280]  That's 100% our thumbnail. Thank you.
[20:08.460 --> 20:11.020]  This is how he does it. This is Gavin reaching around.
[20:11.600 --> 20:13.920]  Are you seated when you're doing this or are you standing?
[20:15.000 --> 20:15.940]  Well, either way.
[20:16.180 --> 20:16.600]  Either way.
[20:16.940 --> 20:18.160]  But usually I'll be seated.
[20:19.480 --> 20:24.400]  No, I don't sit on those, but the whole point is
[20:24.400 --> 20:26.180]  I don't have a long enough arm.
[20:26.200 --> 20:30.100]  I don't have a King Louis enough arm to actually get an entire fist back there.
[20:30.200 --> 20:31.160]  That's not what Andrew said.
[20:31.760 --> 20:32.940]  That's what I'm picturing.
[20:39.670 --> 20:42.470]  The King Louis thing is so funny to me.
[20:43.790 --> 20:46.150]  That's what I'm seeing. It's like King Louis.
[20:46.830 --> 20:49.390]  And the type of animal he is, how do you spell that?
[20:51.510 --> 20:53.730]  O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N.
[20:55.390 --> 20:56.070]  O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N.
[20:56.810 --> 20:59.050]  Or there's their G that's silent.
[21:00.550 --> 21:01.530]  You think?
[21:01.830 --> 21:05.130]  O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N.
[21:05.550 --> 21:05.850]  What do you?
[21:07.050 --> 21:08.490]  What do you? What?
[21:09.590 --> 21:12.310]  Orangutan? Orangutan? Orangutan?
[21:13.250 --> 21:14.770]  That's how you spell it.
[21:14.930 --> 21:16.890]  Orangutan. Orangutan.
[21:17.170 --> 21:19.870]  You fucked me up now. It's Orangutan, right?
[21:20.090 --> 21:20.890]  It is Orangutan.
[21:20.890 --> 21:21.450]  Yeah.
[21:21.790 --> 21:25.330]  But I thought it was Orangutan. It was an old episode thing.
[21:26.010 --> 21:28.190]  I spent my whole life thinking it was Orangutan.
[21:29.530 --> 21:34.830]  You said that and it like it like I could feel like my brain like splitting in half.
[21:34.990 --> 21:36.670]  You will hear Orangutan in the wild.
[21:36.830 --> 21:38.530]  There are plenty of people that think it's Orangutan.
[21:38.770 --> 21:40.230]  I'm not alone when I thought that.
[21:40.570 --> 21:42.130]  And then it blew my mind when I heard Orangutan.
[21:42.410 --> 21:44.510]  We've covered this. This is old face material.
[21:44.690 --> 21:45.410]  We've been through this.
[21:45.910 --> 21:48.250]  It's old news, but I just I can't.
[21:48.310 --> 21:48.950]  Got him.
[21:48.950 --> 21:53.470]  You crouched or like hunched over massaging your balls for the pee to come out.
[21:53.470 --> 21:54.610]  Why am I hunched over?
[21:56.250 --> 21:58.810]  So your long arms can reach.
[22:00.810 --> 22:03.070]  I'm going down the front. I don't need to hunch.
[22:06.870 --> 22:10.610]  That becomes dangerous because your arm becomes in the path potentially.
[22:10.890 --> 22:11.850]  Yeah. Risky.
[22:12.290 --> 22:14.650]  No. And also I washed my hands after.
[22:15.030 --> 22:16.130]  After getting pee on them?
[22:16.170 --> 22:16.910]  After a big old piss.
[22:19.510 --> 22:22.970]  No, he didn't get pee on him, Nick. He gets ball. He gets balls at him.
[22:24.070 --> 22:24.430]  Insane.
[22:24.590 --> 22:28.310]  I did occasionally when I had the like before this was so much of a problem.
[22:28.430 --> 22:31.570]  I did have the toilet, the automatic toilet where it flushes for you.
[22:31.610 --> 22:34.630]  And I would just try and not use my hands at any point.
[22:36.030 --> 22:36.390]  What?
[22:37.850 --> 22:39.430]  Hang on. What?
[22:40.810 --> 22:41.170]  What?
[22:41.590 --> 22:42.610]  You would go in.
[22:43.190 --> 22:44.930]  He'd make a game of it. It's great.
[22:45.010 --> 22:47.990]  You would open up and then you would just like.
[22:47.990 --> 22:50.470]  I feel like I've said I've said too much this episode.
[22:50.490 --> 22:51.030]  I've talked.
[22:51.210 --> 22:52.590]  No, no, no, no. Continue.
[22:53.010 --> 22:56.010]  If anything, you haven't said enough.
[22:56.250 --> 23:00.170]  So so my my argument with that I used to have with Meg was like,
[23:00.290 --> 23:03.590]  surely I don't need to wash my hands if this is how I pee, right?
[23:03.870 --> 23:07.910]  And I'd go in the bog, pull down the old shorts and undies from the side.
[23:08.810 --> 23:11.710]  Bog seat opens. I sort of squat, do a little piss.
[23:11.910 --> 23:14.850]  I shake it around, get all the get all those drips off.
[23:15.210 --> 23:16.230]  And then I pull it all up.
[23:16.230 --> 23:18.950]  The bog flushes itself and closes the lid.
[23:19.030 --> 23:20.350]  Do I need to wash my hands?
[23:20.830 --> 23:21.370]  You touched the lock?
[23:22.170 --> 23:27.430]  Geoff just gave us the thumbnail in the middle of the episode.
[23:29.250 --> 23:30.770]  He's pointing at his mouth.
[23:31.310 --> 23:33.010]  He's pointing at his tummy.
[23:33.450 --> 23:35.930]  He's got his big hand behind him.
[23:37.210 --> 23:40.010]  You know this guy doesn't wash his hands after he pisses.
[23:40.130 --> 23:40.510]  Check him out.
[23:40.770 --> 23:40.930]  Oh no.
[23:41.830 --> 23:42.750]  You don't lock the door?
[23:43.350 --> 23:45.270]  That's Gavin celebrating after a clean pee.
[23:45.270 --> 23:46.510]  He's like, I did it.
[23:46.970 --> 23:47.470]  Flawless.
[23:47.730 --> 23:49.710]  He's just pointing at his bananas, really.
[23:50.110 --> 23:53.490]  That's Gavin exposing himself to Meg saying, look at me.
[23:53.550 --> 23:55.310]  I'm spotless, clean.
[23:56.110 --> 24:00.710]  But what I realized I was doing is I was washing my hands for no reason.
[24:01.250 --> 24:02.870]  And then I was just like, I don't need to be doing this.
[24:03.390 --> 24:07.250]  I feel like this is insane discourse from somebody who has given me shit
[24:07.250 --> 24:11.690]  for eating in the bathroom when I haven't used the bathroom.
[24:11.690 --> 24:15.670]  You put, you put a bowl of muffin on the toilet seat.
[24:15.830 --> 24:17.090]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[24:17.890 --> 24:19.070]  On top of the lid.
[24:19.850 --> 24:20.990]  When it was down.
[24:22.310 --> 24:23.430]  In a bowl.
[24:24.010 --> 24:24.450]  It's dirty.
[24:25.010 --> 24:27.530]  Yeah, but you're sitting on it.
[24:28.270 --> 24:28.870]  You're sitting.
[24:31.310 --> 24:32.730]  I'm not sitting on a muffin.
[24:35.970 --> 24:38.850]  You think that you can literally use the bathroom,
[24:38.850 --> 24:41.950]  flush and then walk out without washing your hands?
[24:42.150 --> 24:44.690]  I think that's way worse than me.
[24:45.350 --> 24:47.550]  I could have put my hands in my pocket the whole time.
[24:47.630 --> 24:50.570]  I mean, if my trousers were down, I would need long arms.
[24:50.830 --> 24:52.410]  The water's moving around.
[24:52.550 --> 24:53.570]  The seas are shifting.
[24:53.810 --> 24:55.350]  Particles are flying everywhere.
[24:55.870 --> 24:59.730]  So why am I not washing my back and my neck every time I go to the toilet?
[24:59.870 --> 25:00.510]  That's a good question.
[25:01.130 --> 25:01.810]  It's a good question.
[25:02.310 --> 25:03.030]  Probably should.
[25:05.030 --> 25:05.770]  Probably should.
[25:05.770 --> 25:08.510]  My point is, is you're shooting particles everywhere.
[25:08.750 --> 25:09.890]  I'm not doing anything.
[25:11.630 --> 25:13.050]  I'm not doing anything.
[25:13.470 --> 25:14.690]  You're, you're eating.
[25:15.390 --> 25:19.570]  You put it down the whole time in a separate bowl.
[25:19.970 --> 25:22.530]  You put your headphones on the butt crumb zone.
[25:23.490 --> 25:24.250]  Yeah, I did do that.
[25:24.630 --> 25:25.830]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[25:26.010 --> 25:28.090]  And that's going right by your face and in your ears.
[25:28.170 --> 25:28.950]  You got poo here.
[25:30.030 --> 25:32.190]  Well, you got fucking ball hands.
[25:32.470 --> 25:33.030]  What do you mean?
[25:33.030 --> 25:34.350]  We're a dynamic duo.
[25:36.370 --> 25:38.250]  I can wash my ears, dummy.
[25:38.930 --> 25:40.770]  You put your headphones in the toilet zone.
[25:41.190 --> 25:42.030]  There's a shower.
[25:43.530 --> 25:45.690]  They're so easily washable.
[25:46.690 --> 25:48.590]  I do it all the time.
[25:51.250 --> 25:52.790]  And I say that lovingly.
[25:52.850 --> 25:54.090]  I call you dummy lovingly.
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.970]  Because I'm equally dumb in this.
[25:56.410 --> 25:57.490]  But you're being ridiculous.
[25:57.810 --> 26:01.010]  I wash my hands like I don't wash my face.
[26:03.980 --> 26:05.500]  What are you saying?
[26:08.820 --> 26:14.380]  You use the headphones outside of the toilet, outside of the bath as well.
[26:14.620 --> 26:17.320]  You get clean and then you put dirty...
[26:17.320 --> 26:19.420]  You use your hands outside as well.
[26:20.380 --> 26:21.680]  What do you mean?
[26:21.760 --> 26:22.760]  I've washed them.
[26:23.180 --> 26:24.740]  I've washed my ears.
[26:24.960 --> 26:26.060]  I'm talking about the headphones.
[26:26.300 --> 26:28.840]  You don't wash your headphones after you've got out of the bath.
[26:28.980 --> 26:30.660]  But I wash my head every day.
[26:37.400 --> 26:39.520]  I'm sorry, I can't come into the room right now.
[26:39.580 --> 26:40.400]  I gotta wash my head.
[26:42.420 --> 26:43.620]  Give them a nice wash.
[26:44.520 --> 26:45.840]  I'm not using the same headphones.
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.840]  You've thrown out a dummy today and earlier you threw out a stupid.
[26:49.380 --> 26:50.180]  I did, yeah.
[26:50.520 --> 26:52.580]  Well, you've had a really dumb day, which I relate.
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.060]  So I need to like really put the spotlight on whenever anyone has one of those.
[26:57.180 --> 26:57.620]  Because it's typically me.
[26:57.760 --> 26:59.120]  You didn't call me stupid.
[27:00.220 --> 27:01.160]  Oh wait, was that aimed at me?
[27:01.160 --> 27:03.340]  I think it was because it had to have been.
[27:03.460 --> 27:03.800]  It doesn't matter.
[27:04.880 --> 27:07.880]  You've kind of been the dumb one every time today.
[27:08.300 --> 27:09.920]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:10.120 --> 27:10.800]  Oh man.
[27:11.260 --> 27:12.780]  So what else is new?
[27:15.960 --> 27:17.260]  That's how we ended that?
[27:17.360 --> 27:17.980]  That's awesome.
[27:18.420 --> 27:22.480]  I don't even remember how that started.
[27:22.680 --> 27:23.720]  What were you guys arguing about?
[27:23.760 --> 27:26.500]  Well, to summarize, though, do I need to wash my hands if that's how I pissed?
[27:27.020 --> 27:27.380]  Probably.
[27:27.820 --> 27:30.720]  I mean, based on your general code of ethics, yes.
[27:30.720 --> 27:31.460]  Yeah.
[27:31.880 --> 27:32.280]  Yeah.
[27:32.600 --> 27:33.920]  I just think it's crazy.
[27:34.140 --> 27:39.060]  It's like what you're talking about is like, you're like a step away from like how a dog pisses.
[27:39.480 --> 27:40.140]  I could.
[27:40.240 --> 27:42.540]  You're doing like a bathroom dog piss, dude.
[27:42.800 --> 27:47.680]  What if I put a GoPro on my chest filming forwards and I constantly film my hands the
[27:47.680 --> 27:50.220]  entire time and I show you the entire process?
[27:50.620 --> 27:52.100]  Hey man, no thank you.
[27:52.820 --> 27:56.440]  Hey, what if I put a big wide angle lens on my head and then point it down towards my dick?
[27:56.660 --> 27:57.540]  You guys want to see that?
[27:58.220 --> 27:59.280]  No, you're not going to look down.
[27:59.340 --> 27:59.980]  It's my chest.
[27:59.980 --> 28:01.360]  How can I look down with my chest?
[28:01.600 --> 28:03.180]  I don't want to see any of it.
[28:03.320 --> 28:03.920]  Yeah, do it.
[28:03.960 --> 28:04.640]  I don't want to see it.
[28:04.920 --> 28:05.760]  I don't want to see it.
[28:06.020 --> 28:06.440]  Nick wants.
[28:06.580 --> 28:07.140]  Nick can't wait.
[28:07.320 --> 28:08.100]  Nick wants to see it.
[28:08.140 --> 28:09.480]  Your hands don't touch anything.
[28:09.580 --> 28:10.300]  They don't flush.
[28:10.380 --> 28:11.600]  They don't take your pants down.
[28:11.680 --> 28:12.900]  They don't touch the lid.
[28:13.140 --> 28:16.400]  The only thing they touch is like the pockets area of my shorts.
[28:16.820 --> 28:19.320]  And I sort of grab through to get the boxes down to.
[28:19.440 --> 28:20.720]  But it's the particles, man.
[28:21.180 --> 28:22.340]  The particles get you.
[28:22.800 --> 28:23.480]  He's got you there.
[28:23.940 --> 28:27.920]  OK, so what if I keep my hands in the hoodie pouch?
[28:28.520 --> 28:32.880]  I mean, once the like, I feel like you're just doing so much work to just not wash your hands.
[28:33.340 --> 28:34.800]  If you're able to, I'll say this.
[28:34.840 --> 28:37.960]  If you're able to walk into a bathroom with your hands in your hoodie pouch,
[28:39.580 --> 28:45.560]  disrobe to the degree that you can pee, pee, rerobe, flush,
[28:46.180 --> 28:51.400]  and then leave the room without those hands ever leaving your leaving your hoodie pocket.
[28:51.760 --> 28:52.620]  I think you're fine.
[28:52.980 --> 28:53.960]  How does he get his dick out?
[28:54.500 --> 28:56.700]  That's that's that's not what we're talking about.
[28:56.700 --> 28:58.420]  It is the slide, he said.
[28:58.840 --> 29:00.520]  If he can figure it out, he can figure it out.
[29:00.560 --> 29:02.400]  If your hands don't leave that hoodie pocket, you're fine.
[29:02.760 --> 29:09.640]  I will say what I feel like undervaluing is that it is just a nice practice to wash your hands
[29:09.640 --> 29:11.020]  because you're doing other stuff.
[29:11.440 --> 29:15.680]  Yeah, there's an implication that your hands aren't dirty from other things you've done.
[29:16.340 --> 29:21.340]  So even if it is a clean bathroom run, it just is a good excuse to wash your hands.
[29:21.500 --> 29:23.580]  Yeah, I mean, I wash my hands probably ten times a day.
[29:23.580 --> 29:26.700]  Most of the time I wash my hands before I go to the bathroom
[29:26.700 --> 29:28.500]  because I don't want to touch my dick with dirty hands.
[29:29.620 --> 29:31.740]  You got such a clean dick, you don't want to get it dirty?
[29:31.940 --> 29:33.380]  I don't want him to get it dirtier.
[29:33.880 --> 29:34.820]  What does my dick do?
[29:34.900 --> 29:37.660]  It's fucking hiding all nice and clean in my underwear every day.
[29:37.880 --> 29:39.600]  My dick gets treated like a fucking king.
[29:39.880 --> 29:43.760]  It wakes up, it gets a shower every day, then it gets taken to go pee-pee,
[29:44.080 --> 29:49.100]  and then it does that, and then it gets brand new clean clothes that are fresh put on it,
[29:49.240 --> 29:53.160]  and then it gets left alone all day long unless I need to take it out to whiz every once in a while.
[29:53.160 --> 29:56.180]  Why do I want to incorporate dirt and grime into that situation?
[29:56.300 --> 29:58.480]  You spend so much time keeping it clean and fresh.
[29:58.640 --> 30:01.700]  We can't do this, but I remember in kindergarten,
[30:01.700 --> 30:04.560]  when they taught us how to wash our hands properly,
[30:04.560 --> 30:11.780]  they did a thing where they put some sort of dye or substance on our hands,
[30:11.840 --> 30:13.660]  and then we had to wash our hands with soap,
[30:14.060 --> 30:19.320]  and they could tell if we missed a spot by using a purple light if there were specks.
[30:19.320 --> 30:22.960]  I won't be doing a Geoff Dick speck,
[30:23.180 --> 30:25.880]  doing the speck shit if I'm clean as dick, isn't this so funny?
[30:26.900 --> 30:28.460]  I'm into it, let's do it.
[30:33.020 --> 30:35.820]  Oh, sorry, you're gonna say something, Gavin, I apologize.
[30:36.800 --> 30:37.920]  Oh, I'm sure it was worthless.
[30:44.380 --> 30:45.680]  We gotta get our dick.
[30:45.680 --> 30:49.460]  I had a thing happen that filled me with so much joy,
[30:49.540 --> 30:54.600]  it made me one of my favorite coincidences of all time happen recently.
[30:54.980 --> 30:57.560]  I don't know if part of this was in a recording,
[30:57.580 --> 30:59.520]  I was trying to talk to Nick about it yesterday,
[30:59.600 --> 31:02.660]  and we couldn't remember if it was between something,
[31:02.700 --> 31:06.920]  or if it was said somewhere, so maybe it was captured.
[31:07.280 --> 31:11.740]  But we recently discovered Geoff has a new word that he hates,
[31:11.740 --> 31:13.780]  word that he despises.
[31:14.480 --> 31:19.360]  Not a fan of a very specific word, which is collab.
[31:20.060 --> 31:20.880]  Geoff hates collab.
[31:21.400 --> 31:21.940]  I hate that word.
[31:22.080 --> 31:23.580]  He really dislikes collab.
[31:25.280 --> 31:27.500]  And it's been coming up a lot recently, you know,
[31:27.540 --> 31:30.060]  we talked about the rooster teeth coming back or whatever.
[31:30.500 --> 31:35.420]  And Geoff, we've determined, hates collab in a way that I don't necessarily understand.
[31:35.940 --> 31:37.420]  But you hate it, and that's fine.
[31:37.540 --> 31:39.000]  I don't need to, you hate it.
[31:39.480 --> 31:41.300]  Yeah, do you just hate abbreviations?
[31:41.740 --> 31:45.220]  I don't like abbreviation for abbreviation's sake.
[31:45.600 --> 31:46.600]  I also don't like...
[31:47.960 --> 31:50.180]  Collab is right up there with me for za.
[31:50.800 --> 31:52.140]  I don't like when someone... just say pizza.
[31:53.480 --> 31:54.460]  Like, was it that hard?
[31:54.780 --> 31:57.380]  Was the other syllable that fucking hard to get out?
[31:57.780 --> 32:01.640]  Are you in such a goddamn food hurry you can't say the first part?
[32:01.980 --> 32:02.740]  No, you're not.
[32:02.800 --> 32:05.220]  Just say pizza, not za.
[32:05.400 --> 32:05.920]  I don't have to...
[32:05.920 --> 32:09.240]  I have to do the fucking mental gymnastics to stop for a second and go,
[32:09.240 --> 32:12.080]  wait a minute, this person said something incorrect and stupid.
[32:12.360 --> 32:19.460]  Let me slow down my brain to go backwards to figure out what this dumb ass is trying to convey.
[32:19.620 --> 32:24.760]  Because they can't use complex fucking word... five letter words properly.
[32:25.480 --> 32:28.220]  So this is a whole other layer of hate that we didn't get.
[32:28.240 --> 32:30.440]  By the same token, I don't like the word collab.
[32:30.820 --> 32:32.980]  Oh, hey, we should collab together.
[32:33.160 --> 32:35.340]  Hey, what's up, buddy? You wanna collab with me?
[32:35.420 --> 32:36.700]  I play video games, you play video games.
[32:36.880 --> 32:37.700]  Let's collab.
[32:37.700 --> 32:40.080]  How about, hey, do you want to make some content together?
[32:40.320 --> 32:41.560]  Would you like to make a video with me?
[32:41.620 --> 32:43.520]  Do you ever want to do a let's play? We can do that.
[32:43.780 --> 32:45.820]  Would you like to collaborate on a project?
[32:46.020 --> 32:47.520]  Not like finger guns out.
[32:47.760 --> 32:48.960]  Hey, you want to collab?
[32:50.260 --> 32:51.120]  Internet, right?
[32:51.220 --> 32:53.180]  Woo, Web 2.0, suck my dick.
[32:57.760 --> 32:58.360]  Nice and clear.
[32:59.120 --> 33:03.260]  It was, I mean, that is like an annoyance you have with unnecessary abbreviation.
[33:03.660 --> 33:06.240]  At the time, it just seemed like you were annoyed at even the definition
[33:06.240 --> 33:07.840]  of the word and how it was being used.
[33:08.280 --> 33:09.760]  You're like, collab, what does that even mean?
[33:09.760 --> 33:13.160]  I worked for fucking 20 years with these people.
[33:14.060 --> 33:15.360]  You don't have to say that to me.
[33:15.400 --> 33:16.300]  Hey, man, you want to collab?
[33:16.460 --> 33:17.900]  It's like, who do you think I am?
[33:17.940 --> 33:19.900]  Of course, we make content together all goddamn long.
[33:19.980 --> 33:21.740]  Just say, hey, do you want to make some fucking content together?
[33:21.940 --> 33:23.080]  You don't have to buzzword me.
[33:23.160 --> 33:23.920]  We know each other.
[33:24.100 --> 33:27.500]  I feel like everything involving collabs in general is really annoying.
[33:27.600 --> 33:30.960]  Like, you get all those emails where it's like, this, x, that.
[33:31.500 --> 33:32.640]  Why is it an x, though?
[33:33.200 --> 33:36.680]  Because that's even cooler way to say collab.
[33:36.960 --> 33:38.340]  But surely it should be a plus.
[33:38.340 --> 33:41.020]  Like, you're not multiplying my thing by your thing.
[33:41.900 --> 33:43.140]  You're adding them together.
[33:43.560 --> 33:44.600]  Why is it the x?
[33:45.380 --> 33:45.700]  I don't know.
[33:45.940 --> 33:46.140]  It's a great question.
[33:46.360 --> 33:47.320]  It is a great question.
[33:48.160 --> 33:48.300]  But...
[33:48.300 --> 33:50.040]  It should be a fucking divi...
[33:50.040 --> 33:52.860]  It should be a division symbol, because what you're doing is you're making your content
[33:52.860 --> 33:54.920]  half as good and their content half as good at the same time.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.100]  Well, then shouldn't it be a minus?
[33:59.820 --> 34:00.440]  Even better!
[34:05.060 --> 34:09.180]  Well, Bernie, who bought Rooster Teeth back, has a podcast called Morning Somewhere,
[34:09.300 --> 34:11.480]  and they did a Q&A talking about the Rooster Teeth stuff.
[34:11.880 --> 34:15.560]  And in that Q&A, they addressed the questions of like,
[34:15.640 --> 34:18.280]  working with people that were previously associated with the company.
[34:18.880 --> 34:21.520]  I have a clip relating to that that I'm going to play.
[34:22.140 --> 34:23.100]  Oh, okay.
[34:25.240 --> 34:25.520]  Maybe.
[34:25.860 --> 34:27.120]  Not so easy, is it?
[34:29.440 --> 34:30.080]  Got him!
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.100]  So, uh, so if you if you do talk to people, I can't control what anyone does,
[34:34.120 --> 34:37.280]  but if you do talk to people, I would I would appreciate,
[34:37.420 --> 34:40.860]  personally, if you would use the word collaborate instead of go back.
[34:40.940 --> 34:43.160]  Go back is, I think, kind of insane.
[34:46.360 --> 34:51.420]  I have never laughed harder at something that was so innocent,
[34:51.760 --> 34:58.860]  like he was trying to frame that in a way that is so caring for the people related to it.
[34:58.860 --> 35:02.480]  And I just went, everyone's going to ask Geoff if he's going to collab.
[35:03.160 --> 35:04.640]  They're all going to use collab.
[35:05.300 --> 35:08.300]  This is the greatest thing that's happened all year.
[35:09.300 --> 35:12.480]  He didn't even he didn't know that wasn't a planned attack.
[35:12.640 --> 35:15.320]  He was trying to be sweet and you fucking hate collab.
[35:15.440 --> 35:16.500]  It's the worst thing.
[35:16.780 --> 35:19.440]  It's the worst thing anyone could say to you.
[35:19.780 --> 35:25.020]  And he he said, if you could do it for me personally, it's so good.
[35:25.240 --> 35:26.160]  Oh, my God.
[35:26.160 --> 35:29.000]  Oh, I haven't texted Bernie in months.
[35:29.100 --> 35:31.240]  And I texted him and said, hey, can I clip?
[35:31.340 --> 35:33.920]  Can I clip the regulation?
[35:34.620 --> 35:35.660]  Something happened.
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.040]  Oh, collab.
[35:39.160 --> 35:42.160]  So, Geoff, are you do you have any plans to collab?
[35:45.600 --> 35:48.220]  It's such a currently, no, I'm not.
[35:48.300 --> 35:50.560]  I'm not doing any collabs at the moment.
[35:50.660 --> 35:55.500]  I'm still, you know, I'm accepting collab pitches from people that are interested in
[35:55.500 --> 35:57.960]  collabing with me in the future at some point.
[35:58.060 --> 36:01.800]  I don't currently have any collabs on the books.
[36:02.160 --> 36:06.040]  Now, a very sweet gesture from from Bernie and a really thoughtful thing to do and say.
[36:06.460 --> 36:09.100]  I just used a dog shit word to do it.
[36:13.530 --> 36:14.410]  That's OK.
[36:14.570 --> 36:15.690]  Not everybody's perfect, right?
[36:16.170 --> 36:17.170]  No, absolutely not.
[36:17.330 --> 36:20.710]  We got a fucking guy on your show that knuckles his balls every time he beats.
[36:21.830 --> 36:23.230]  I just want the knuckling.
[36:23.770 --> 36:25.250]  I want the automatic knuckling.
[36:25.250 --> 36:27.470]  He wants somebody to knuckle it for him.
[36:27.690 --> 36:30.910]  I want someone to speed bag my balls so I get all the piss out.
[36:31.010 --> 36:31.710]  What's the problem?
[36:32.070 --> 36:33.010]  It's not a speed bag.
[36:33.330 --> 36:34.750]  It's just a gentle push.
[36:36.270 --> 36:43.250]  I really like this story, by the way, of the of the mind table where I guess Eric's label vanished.
[36:43.990 --> 36:45.290]  And yeah, what the fuck?
[36:45.390 --> 36:46.650]  So they just wrote idiot.
[36:48.830 --> 36:51.930]  Eric's got a speech bubble that says idiot, but because his label's got it,
[36:51.950 --> 36:53.590]  it just looks like he's labeled an idiot.
[36:54.290 --> 36:58.530]  I think I replied to them and I just said, hey, what the fuck?
[37:00.510 --> 37:03.170]  And that was drawn by Sabrina, I think.
[37:03.290 --> 37:04.450]  Yeah, she did a great job.
[37:04.610 --> 37:06.550]  I actually I love this art style.
[37:06.730 --> 37:09.310]  I think this is like such a cool look.
[37:09.510 --> 37:12.930]  And then to have my label gone and it just says idiot.
[37:13.250 --> 37:15.670]  It's like, what the hey, what the fuck is this shit?
[37:16.890 --> 37:20.510]  I love that Andrew's in the TV with the mic on our end.
[37:20.510 --> 37:23.650]  And I love that you can see Nick through the monkey helmet.
[37:24.870 --> 37:28.070]  So the head of the table, it's wherever the host sits.
[37:31.230 --> 37:33.970]  Okay, I'm just confirming the head of the table is wherever the host.
[37:33.990 --> 37:34.970]  That's what we learned, right?
[37:35.730 --> 37:35.930]  Yeah.
[37:36.170 --> 37:37.850]  Let me let me ask you guys a question.
[37:38.810 --> 37:43.330]  Let's say you go get a you go get a hamburger and french fries somewhere for lunch with some friends.
[37:43.930 --> 37:44.170]  Okay.
[37:44.390 --> 37:44.570]  Okay.
[37:44.630 --> 37:45.470]  Onions, no onions?
[37:47.450 --> 37:50.270]  Inconsequential to this particular scenario.
[37:50.270 --> 37:51.150]  But we do.
[37:51.250 --> 37:55.330]  I assume we were going to go do the onions thing later today, but I assume that pushes to next week.
[37:55.410 --> 37:56.470]  Probably when we do the other thing.
[37:56.790 --> 37:56.970]  Yeah.
[37:57.370 --> 37:57.630]  Okay.
[37:58.410 --> 37:59.530]  You had a squeezy bottle of ketchup.
[38:00.490 --> 38:03.670]  The the the the the hamburger tray is full.
[38:03.890 --> 38:05.770]  It's full of fries and then a hamburger.
[38:05.890 --> 38:06.890]  There's no free space.
[38:07.330 --> 38:10.710]  So you just what do you do with your ketchup if you want to put ketchup on the fries?
[38:11.710 --> 38:12.030]  Uh.
[38:12.310 --> 38:13.090]  How about a corner?
[38:13.670 --> 38:14.150]  It depends.
[38:15.030 --> 38:19.310]  There's a lot of situations I've been in where I don't have the ketchup real estate for it.
[38:19.310 --> 38:20.770]  Do you have multiple?
[38:21.030 --> 38:22.710]  There's no there is no ketchup real estate.
[38:23.030 --> 38:24.750]  That's what I'm saying where I have to make it.
[38:25.070 --> 38:25.510]  Yeah.
[38:25.610 --> 38:33.210]  I've done a thing where I've had uh sometimes the lid I'll take the lid off of a thing and
[38:33.210 --> 38:36.070]  then I'll shoot it into the top of the lid and I'll use that.
[38:36.270 --> 38:36.910]  That was no lid.
[38:37.130 --> 38:37.590]  No lid?
[38:37.990 --> 38:38.870]  Nah, lid's not available.
[38:39.330 --> 38:45.870]  Okay. Do I have a second uh you know how like if you get uh chicken strips and fries you get two
[38:45.870 --> 38:46.450]  different boxes?
[38:46.650 --> 38:47.770]  Here's what you can do.
[38:48.050 --> 38:48.310]  Okay.
[38:48.310 --> 38:51.670]  You could put a napkin on the table and load that up with ketchup if you want.
[38:51.750 --> 38:51.850]  No.
[38:51.870 --> 38:56.510]  That's the only other option you have outside of the bag or the current vessel.
[38:56.930 --> 38:57.290]  Okay.
[38:59.050 --> 39:00.730]  Uh and what am I eating sorry?
[39:01.190 --> 39:02.250]  Just a burger and fries.
[39:02.470 --> 39:03.270]  Burger and fries.
[39:05.050 --> 39:07.150]  Honestly, I'm probably shooting it in the corner.
[39:07.750 --> 39:12.470]  If I'm not going to do that and hear me out because it's going to what's on my burger?
[39:13.890 --> 39:15.870]  Uh cheese, onion.
[39:16.650 --> 39:17.090]  Yeah, for sure.
[39:18.070 --> 39:20.290]  Pickle and uh tomato.
[39:20.950 --> 39:24.130]  If I'm like if it's a situation where I think.
[39:24.130 --> 39:24.390]  Lettuce as well.
[39:24.590 --> 39:25.330]  Lettuce as well.
[39:25.370 --> 39:29.430]  Because I don't want to drown any of the fries in ketchup but I do want ketchup in the mix.
[39:30.370 --> 39:37.250]  I might disassemble my burger and use the lower bun as a dippable surface.
[39:37.730 --> 39:38.850]  Oh that you're a maniac.
[39:39.450 --> 39:40.590]  You need the bun.
[39:40.610 --> 39:40.890]  Hyper.
[39:41.330 --> 39:42.070]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:42.310 --> 39:43.210]  I'm not getting rid of it.
[39:43.270 --> 39:43.690]  Hear me out.
[39:45.110 --> 39:46.070]  Deassemble, right?
[39:46.490 --> 39:47.530]  Put the burger to the side.
[39:48.130 --> 39:49.090]  Use the lower bun.
[39:49.590 --> 39:52.230]  Pour ketchup on the lower bun on top of it.
[39:52.690 --> 39:55.050]  Dip the fries into the bun.
[39:55.550 --> 39:58.830]  And then when I'm done with that, reassemble the burger.
[39:59.090 --> 40:01.310]  But then you can't eat any burger while you're eating fries.
[40:01.450 --> 40:02.470]  You want to go back and forth?
[40:02.590 --> 40:03.270]  And your hamburger.
[40:03.370 --> 40:04.430]  Your hamburger is cold now.
[40:04.470 --> 40:06.210]  You took the roof off of it and let all the heat out.
[40:06.250 --> 40:08.310]  I typically am a one and then the other guy.
[40:08.730 --> 40:09.690]  Oh, psychopath.
[40:09.690 --> 40:10.910]  They are lunatic.
[40:11.330 --> 40:13.970]  I want each bite to be as uniform as possible.
[40:14.070 --> 40:15.990]  I want as much stuff all at once.
[40:16.430 --> 40:17.310]  Oh, that's also lunatic.
[40:17.350 --> 40:25.730]  I feel like I watched a clip once 15 years ago that you should eat the meat last from a digestive
[40:25.730 --> 40:32.370]  purpose. So I typically will eat all of the vegetables before I touch the protein on my plate.
[40:35.070 --> 40:39.610]  But surely if your stomach is digesting all the veg, then the meat is just sat on it.
[40:39.690 --> 40:40.830]  You would think.
[40:41.130 --> 40:42.310]  And that could be right.
[40:42.690 --> 40:48.010]  But it is a code that I've lived by for over a decade because I feel like I've heard that once.
[40:48.490 --> 40:49.250]  Yeah, there you go.
[40:49.390 --> 40:50.810]  Could easily be wrong.
[40:50.910 --> 40:53.210]  I'm not arguing that this is definitely right.
[40:53.790 --> 40:55.570]  I took a picture of what Geoff did.
[40:55.630 --> 40:56.070]  Do you want to see it?
[40:56.470 --> 40:56.870]  Please.
[40:57.270 --> 40:59.090]  I don't think what I did was a big deal at all.
[41:00.030 --> 41:00.410]  Let's see.
[41:00.610 --> 41:00.830]  Okay.
[41:01.030 --> 41:01.810]  I just poured some.
[41:01.930 --> 41:03.830]  I just poured ketchup on some of the fries.
[41:04.250 --> 41:04.890]  Totally fine.
[41:04.890 --> 41:07.290]  I just used that as the kid.
[41:07.390 --> 41:09.290]  I just dipped the fries into the ketchup.
[41:09.710 --> 41:11.510]  And then, yeah, it ruins a couple of the fries.
[41:11.570 --> 41:12.890]  But I wasn't going to eat all the fries anyway.
[41:13.010 --> 41:13.970]  So what the fuck does that matter?
[41:14.830 --> 41:17.450]  If you do not plan on eating all the fries, totally accept.
[41:17.510 --> 41:19.690]  He lost his fucking mind for some reason.
[41:19.910 --> 41:21.430]  I thought you were a lunatic.
[41:21.810 --> 41:22.730]  And I'll tell you why.
[41:22.750 --> 41:26.450]  That's fine if you got a fork because you can still eat those normally.
[41:27.370 --> 41:32.090]  But you easily could have eaten four or maybe five or six fries,
[41:32.210 --> 41:33.790]  eat in a little hole for your ketchup.
[41:34.510 --> 41:35.930]  But you just went straight on top.
[41:36.050 --> 41:37.010]  And I thought that was the lunacy.
[41:37.350 --> 41:38.430]  Who cares, man?
[41:39.170 --> 41:40.510]  Is that is that?
[41:40.590 --> 41:41.270]  It's not even a burger.
[41:41.470 --> 41:42.530]  I realize it's not even a burger.
[41:42.670 --> 41:43.250]  That's a sandwich.
[41:43.510 --> 41:43.710]  I forgot.
[41:43.870 --> 41:44.810]  I had a BLT that day.
[41:46.450 --> 41:47.510]  Throw my idea out.
[41:47.610 --> 41:48.610]  I'm not doing that with a BLT.
[41:48.790 --> 41:50.150]  Yeah, you would never do that with a BLT.
[41:50.210 --> 41:50.990]  Not in a billion years.
[41:52.790 --> 41:54.910]  I do feel like you could have moved the BLT, though,
[41:54.950 --> 41:56.770]  the rest on the other corner of fries.
[41:57.070 --> 41:58.430]  Well, that's after half of it's gone.
[41:58.550 --> 42:00.430]  The other, you know, this is late into the meal.
[42:00.530 --> 42:02.250]  I've already eaten most of the BLT at that point.
[42:02.350 --> 42:02.610]  Okay.
[42:02.730 --> 42:03.470]  Was it cut in half?
[42:03.790 --> 42:04.790]  Yeah, of course, man.
[42:04.810 --> 42:05.210]  It's a BLT.
[42:05.270 --> 42:05.710]  They're always cutting.
[42:07.730 --> 42:08.510]  That'd be wild.
[42:08.830 --> 42:12.010]  Having a restaurant that just doesn't cut any of its sandwich.
[42:12.330 --> 42:12.450]  No.
[42:12.770 --> 42:14.630]  Also, we're looking at half of it.
[42:14.710 --> 42:17.570]  Like the idea that you ate it half from that way,
[42:17.610 --> 42:19.390]  that you chose to eat it that way.
[42:20.190 --> 42:22.350]  Face it away from me so everybody can see my bite marks.
[42:24.890 --> 42:26.830]  Anyway, Gavin was disturbed by this,
[42:26.890 --> 42:28.410]  but I didn't I didn't even realize that
[42:28.410 --> 42:30.070]  that was a controversial thing to do.
[42:30.330 --> 42:32.410]  Yeah, I would be unfazed by it.
[42:32.430 --> 42:33.290]  I wouldn't even notice.
[42:34.430 --> 42:36.630]  Well, I feel like Jason and Nick also thought it was a bit weird.
[42:36.970 --> 42:38.890]  I think they were having fun with you, but I don't know.
[42:38.890 --> 42:40.010]  What did they? Yeah, I was going to say.
[42:40.110 --> 42:40.810]  Now, what does that mean?
[42:40.850 --> 42:41.650]  What did they say?
[42:41.670 --> 42:43.590]  Because I want to know what they said and how they said it.
[42:43.810 --> 42:44.290]  I don't remember.
[42:44.830 --> 42:47.550]  What really all I did was just lean over and take a photo of that.
[42:47.710 --> 42:48.850]  And Geoff saw me take a photo.
[42:49.010 --> 42:51.930]  I was like, hey, what's wrong with this?
[42:52.050 --> 42:53.570]  And he just really, really fired up.
[42:53.950 --> 42:55.010]  But really, I was just...
[42:55.010 --> 42:58.110]  Oh, am I on edge around you because of, I don't know,
[42:58.490 --> 43:00.850]  the history of our friendship and relationship together?
[43:01.470 --> 43:01.790]  Crazy.
[43:03.330 --> 43:07.090]  Crazy when I see you nonchalantly smirk to yourself,
[43:07.110 --> 43:10.570]  then pull your phone out and try to take a photo of something of mine
[43:10.570 --> 43:11.650]  without me noticing it.
[43:11.870 --> 43:14.210]  Yeah, my spider sense tingles a bit.
[43:14.810 --> 43:17.110]  I just think ketchup is so gross on fingers.
[43:18.890 --> 43:20.130]  I hate getting it on me.
[43:20.730 --> 43:21.870]  And you're just asking for it with that.
[43:21.970 --> 43:25.570]  The guy that's fingering his balls is worried about ketchup.
[43:26.110 --> 43:29.370]  My balls don't leave like a sticky residue on me.
[43:29.390 --> 43:31.770]  He wants to put his knuckle up his dick to...
[43:31.770 --> 43:34.910]  But he doesn't want to touch wet tomato.
[43:35.370 --> 43:38.410]  Are you asking, what would I rather have on my hand?
[43:38.530 --> 43:39.810]  My ball or ketchup?
[43:39.970 --> 43:40.790]  I'd rather have my ball.
[43:41.250 --> 43:41.510]  Ketchup.
[43:41.950 --> 43:42.470]  Yeah, I know.
[43:42.790 --> 43:45.030]  We know how you feel, Gavin.
[43:45.090 --> 43:45.990]  You don't wash your hands.
[43:46.090 --> 43:46.470]  It's fine.
[43:46.770 --> 43:51.010]  I don't get a sticky residue from my own balls.
[43:51.410 --> 43:52.130]  What are you doing?
[43:52.130 --> 43:53.170]  You're doing something wrong then.
[43:54.330 --> 43:58.550]  Oh, I walked into that.
[44:02.910 --> 44:04.550]  You would have just eaten some fries?
[44:04.670 --> 44:05.250]  Is that what you're saying?
[44:05.850 --> 44:06.690]  You would have made a space?
[44:06.770 --> 44:07.270]  You would have burrowed?
[44:07.350 --> 44:10.370]  Yeah, I would have just eaten a hole or made a little mound.
[44:11.570 --> 44:14.270]  I'm always going to put ketchup on something, but not the food.
[44:14.730 --> 44:18.290]  I have a dumb question that you just made me think of that I saved for the show.
[44:18.630 --> 44:20.830]  These are things that I know are dumb.
[44:21.270 --> 44:23.950]  And I just want to ask here, because I just had never considered them.
[44:24.630 --> 44:26.050]  Do beavers eat wood?
[44:26.370 --> 44:27.910]  Or do they just gnaw on?
[44:29.310 --> 44:31.070]  Do they actually eat wood?
[44:31.070 --> 44:31.870]  Like what?
[44:32.470 --> 44:33.470]  I don't know what beavers eat.
[44:33.670 --> 44:36.850]  I assume that they eat wood, but I don't.
[44:37.630 --> 44:38.650]  I think they eat other beavers.
[44:38.810 --> 44:40.510]  I think they're cannibalistic.
[44:40.830 --> 44:41.250]  Really?
[44:41.830 --> 44:42.750]  Yeah, I think so.
[44:42.930 --> 44:44.290]  There's no way they're cannibalistic.
[44:44.670 --> 44:45.390]  Oh my god.
[44:46.610 --> 44:49.930]  Even if they are, this doesn't mean that another beaver is its diet.
[44:50.130 --> 44:52.810]  There's nothing surely that only eats its own kind.
[44:53.970 --> 44:54.810]  I don't know.
[44:57.330 --> 44:59.390]  Oh, it says they don't eat each other.
[44:59.470 --> 45:00.090]  Maybe they don't then.
[45:00.090 --> 45:05.970]  Okay, you're just you're just you're spreading beaver lies on this podcast.
[45:06.370 --> 45:08.830]  I like also that you didn't Google what the beavers eat.
[45:08.910 --> 45:10.450]  You just Googled do beavers eat beavers.
[45:10.550 --> 45:13.490]  I saw a clip of a beaver gnawing down a tree,
[45:13.530 --> 45:15.430]  and I thought, do they actually eat it?
[45:15.450 --> 45:16.830]  Or are they cucking their mouth?
[45:16.950 --> 45:18.070]  Like I was talking about before.
[45:18.310 --> 45:19.030]  Are they? I'm sorry.
[45:19.210 --> 45:20.050]  Are they what?
[45:20.370 --> 45:22.230]  They're cucking their stomach, a stomach cuck,
[45:22.470 --> 45:24.290]  where they're biting into it and not eating it.
[45:24.770 --> 45:26.930]  So you think a beaver mouth cucks its stomach?
[45:27.410 --> 45:29.690]  Is that what you think chewing gum is?
[45:30.450 --> 45:31.810]  Well, that was we talked about that.
[45:31.950 --> 45:35.190]  That was a joke from what we would show, Geoff.
[45:35.290 --> 45:38.310]  What was the Kimmy Schmidt season three?
[45:39.190 --> 45:40.350]  Gum is a lie.
[45:40.430 --> 45:41.490]  Your mouth tells your stomach.
[45:41.670 --> 45:46.810]  But I said recently we were talking about taste buds on the fingers that I wouldn't like it
[45:46.810 --> 45:50.830]  because I'd feel like I was cucking my stomach because I was just tasting everything and not
[45:50.830 --> 45:52.990]  eating. And that's what I meant by that.
[45:53.050 --> 45:55.590]  I was wondering if a beaver was a stomach cuck, but I said mouth.
[45:55.590 --> 46:01.510]  Can we collab with a gum company and just make a gum called cuck?
[46:02.150 --> 46:05.110]  Like the regulation gum just tastes like somebody else's dick.
[46:05.390 --> 46:07.250]  You think my mom knows what cuck is?
[46:08.030 --> 46:09.290]  Oh, my God.
[46:09.370 --> 46:11.050]  Dude, this episode is insane.
[46:11.230 --> 46:12.750]  I'm down to like a six point two.
[46:12.930 --> 46:14.370]  This is insane.
[46:14.970 --> 46:16.190]  She's going to listen to this.
[46:16.230 --> 46:17.570]  And we had the whole butt plug thing.
[46:17.670 --> 46:18.170]  I don't know.
[46:18.250 --> 46:18.710]  I would be.
[46:18.990 --> 46:20.930]  I don't think my mom knows what cucking is.
[46:21.610 --> 46:23.450]  That sounds like you need to find out.
[46:23.730 --> 46:24.630]  I'll find out in a few weeks.
[46:24.630 --> 46:26.250]  Is she good at nature?
[46:26.990 --> 46:28.770]  Is she good at nature?
[46:28.870 --> 46:29.930]  Does she know about animals?
[46:30.030 --> 46:31.210]  She's a fucking Pokemon.
[46:31.470 --> 46:32.070]  Like, what do you mean?
[46:34.090 --> 46:35.690]  No, she's fire based.
[46:36.350 --> 46:38.590]  Does she care about animals?
[46:39.150 --> 46:40.270]  She cares about the planet.
[46:41.030 --> 46:41.750]  Does she recycle?
[46:41.950 --> 46:43.030]  Yes, she recycles.
[46:43.210 --> 46:43.530]  Like, I don't.
[46:43.710 --> 46:46.050]  So maybe she would know about like cuckoos and all that.
[46:46.610 --> 46:47.830]  About cuckoos?
[46:48.370 --> 46:49.070]  From Zelda?
[46:49.070 --> 46:56.790]  No, isn't it coming from where the cuckoo bird like puts one of its eggs in the other nest?
[46:56.850 --> 46:59.550]  This man's coming with the word origin of cuck.
[46:59.930 --> 47:02.070]  Yeah, he's going to the origin.
[47:02.430 --> 47:03.790]  That's what those birds do.
[47:03.870 --> 47:08.130]  I don't know if that's where the word came from or if it's something that you made up.
[47:08.430 --> 47:09.350]  Oh, it makes sense.
[47:09.390 --> 47:11.290]  I also don't know anything about the birds.
[47:11.730 --> 47:14.550]  I'm definitely not going to Google it, if that helps.
[47:14.550 --> 47:21.470]  The birds like the birds will lay an egg in a different bird's nest and they'll replace
[47:21.470 --> 47:25.030]  one of its eggs with their own egg and then it gets another bird to raise its young.
[47:25.390 --> 47:27.330]  Yeah, I feel like that was an episode of The Simpsons.
[47:28.930 --> 47:31.890]  Andrew mentioning the food cucking reminds me, I wanted to tell you guys,
[47:31.950 --> 47:34.310]  I did buy tongue sleeves for us.
[47:34.530 --> 47:35.670]  You have tongue sleeves?
[47:35.810 --> 47:36.210]  Did you really?
[47:36.390 --> 47:37.590]  I don't have them yet.
[47:37.710 --> 47:41.210]  I had they're going to they're going to be a while, but I did some research and I googled
[47:41.210 --> 47:45.090]  around and I found what I think are the best option for tongue sleeve, but we're not going
[47:45.090 --> 47:46.030]  to have them for a while.
[47:46.610 --> 47:51.550]  Nick copied and pasted the definition for for cuckold.
[47:51.710 --> 47:53.470]  And Shelby has to look at this later.
[47:53.470 --> 47:55.370]  And I don't wish this on anyone.
[47:55.710 --> 47:56.330]  This is terrible.
[47:57.610 --> 48:00.070]  It's just Geoff with like, here's the thing.
[48:00.410 --> 48:03.910]  You copied and pasted it next to Geoff with a BLT.
[48:05.110 --> 48:07.110]  In what way are these related?
[48:07.950 --> 48:08.850]  Someone ate his sandwich.
[48:11.090 --> 48:11.730]  God damn.
[48:14.870 --> 48:17.650]  Yeah, so if you just text your mom, what is cuck?
[48:17.990 --> 48:18.730]  Do you think that'd be a...
[48:19.270 --> 48:21.290]  God, this sucks. 5.4.
[48:22.130 --> 48:23.410]  Okay, try if you want.
[48:24.030 --> 48:25.390]  I don't want it to come from me, actually.
[48:25.530 --> 48:26.650]  You're the one suggesting it.
[48:28.210 --> 48:30.770]  Well, I don't understand what you just said.
[48:31.050 --> 48:33.070]  Do you want me to send this text or no?
[48:33.390 --> 48:34.130]  No, I wanted you to.
[48:34.170 --> 48:36.230]  I wanted to know what you were going to text her to ask her.
[48:36.770 --> 48:37.770]  I wasn't going to text her anything.
[48:37.770 --> 48:39.190]  I was going to let her listen to the show.
[48:39.550 --> 48:41.970]  But do you want me to text?
[48:42.290 --> 48:42.970]  I don't care.
[48:43.090 --> 48:43.550]  I will.
[48:44.310 --> 48:44.970]  I have my phone.
[48:45.690 --> 48:46.710]  You sound very angry.
[48:47.130 --> 48:48.230]  Does she have notifications on?
[48:48.230 --> 48:49.250]  He's being ridiculous.
[48:50.530 --> 48:51.630]  Let's take it down a notch.
[48:51.850 --> 48:52.310]  Yeah, you're right.
[48:52.370 --> 48:52.690]  I need to.
[48:52.830 --> 48:53.930]  You're right, but he's being crazy.
[48:54.190 --> 48:54.710]  He's being insane.
[48:54.970 --> 49:00.210]  I'm still processing the way he asked if my mom knew about birds was by saying that she's
[49:00.210 --> 49:00.850]  liking nature.
[49:01.930 --> 49:02.630]  I'm sorry.
[49:02.970 --> 49:04.390]  I'm hung up on previous things.
[49:05.610 --> 49:06.390]  That's, you know what, that's fair.
[49:06.390 --> 49:07.470]  What would you like me to do, Gavin?
[49:08.230 --> 49:09.550]  I would do whatever you want.
[49:09.650 --> 49:11.830]  I don't want to get involved with you and your mom.
[49:11.970 --> 49:13.290]  You know her better than I do.
[49:14.310 --> 49:17.150]  If you want to ask her today, if you want to just let her listen to it.
[49:18.050 --> 49:18.990]  I'm fascinated, though.
[49:19.250 --> 49:19.810]  I wonder what she would say.
[49:19.810 --> 49:20.610]  What's the phrasing?
[49:20.690 --> 49:21.950]  What was the phrasing you just gave?
[49:22.350 --> 49:23.910]  Don't ever use my phrasing for anything.
[49:24.170 --> 49:26.410]  Do you know about nature?
[49:27.450 --> 49:28.750]  Yeah, do you know about nature?
[49:31.330 --> 49:33.550]  Is she good at nature, is what Gavin asked.
[49:34.810 --> 49:35.870]  Hey, mom, what's up?
[49:35.870 --> 49:36.610]  Are you good at nature?
[49:38.350 --> 49:40.930]  Do you know what cockney means?
[49:45.060 --> 49:48.780]  I like if I were playing Jeopardy and the category was good at nature,
[49:48.920 --> 49:51.320]  I wouldn't expect five questions about birds.
[49:54.920 --> 49:55.900]  What do you think of?
[49:55.940 --> 49:56.720]  What do you think of nature?
[49:57.660 --> 49:58.100]  Grass?
[49:58.680 --> 50:01.340]  I think of poison ivy, as dumb as that is.
[50:02.320 --> 50:02.760]  What?
[50:03.300 --> 50:07.400]  If you're good at nature, you're here.
[50:07.400 --> 50:09.220]  You're like controlling weeds.
[50:09.720 --> 50:12.600]  What is the first thing that comes to your mind when I say nature, Gavin?
[50:14.600 --> 50:20.640]  To be honest, it's like the Trivial Pursuit, like science image, the frog and the leaf.
[50:21.300 --> 50:22.260]  OK, how about you, Eric?
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.060]  Trees, forest, like a creek.
[50:27.500 --> 50:28.400]  Like, that's it.
[50:28.900 --> 50:29.500]  Nick Creek.
[50:29.880 --> 50:30.760]  Definitely trees.
[50:31.200 --> 50:33.540]  I think of one tree, like an oak tree.
[50:33.620 --> 50:33.820]  Yeah.
[50:34.300 --> 50:35.780]  Oh, can I actually change my answer?
[50:35.820 --> 50:37.200]  I think of like a hot wife.
[50:37.400 --> 50:39.880]  And it's just a guy sitting in the corner watching.
[50:40.140 --> 50:40.860]  That's nature.
[50:44.820 --> 50:46.640]  I think of Geoff Sandler.
[50:49.680 --> 50:52.540]  Hey, what do you guys know about rare fruit?
[50:54.040 --> 50:57.420]  This is the craziest, this episode is nuts.
[51:00.810 --> 51:04.790]  I'm imagining somebody looking through their window being like, yeah, plant that tree.
[51:09.370 --> 51:11.950]  Yeah, yeah, you put that bush in.
[51:15.770 --> 51:20.590]  It's surely not cuck if you're like just perving from a distance.
[51:20.810 --> 51:22.770]  You gotta be there on a chair, like watching him.
[51:23.830 --> 51:26.830]  If you hire landscapers, are you cucking you on?
[51:27.210 --> 51:32.530]  You hire landscapers and then pull like your recliner out to the front yard and watch?
[51:44.770 --> 51:46.570]  Oh, he's planting a rare bush.
[51:49.570 --> 51:51.810]  So, Geoff, tell us about rare fruit.
[51:52.430 --> 51:55.930]  I was just thinking we should get into rare fruit.
[51:56.330 --> 51:57.530]  Oh, like what, Geoff?
[51:57.730 --> 51:58.290]  Like, look at that.
[51:58.430 --> 51:59.490]  That looks so cool.
[51:59.590 --> 52:00.070]  What is that?
[52:00.250 --> 52:01.670]  That's called a hollow fruit.
[52:02.090 --> 52:04.550]  And it's supposedly it tastes like sugar cane.
[52:04.650 --> 52:08.030]  I saw it on Reddit the other day and that got me thinking I'd never heard about that.
[52:08.030 --> 52:11.970]  And all 49 years of living and I've done some serious living.
[52:12.290 --> 52:13.730]  I've never heard of a hollow fruit.
[52:13.810 --> 52:17.310]  I've never seen anything that looks like a planet explode before that tastes like sugar.
[52:17.470 --> 52:19.070]  I want some of that immediately.
[52:19.290 --> 52:22.430]  And then that got me thinking there's a lot about fruit we don't know.
[52:22.510 --> 52:26.530]  There's a lot of rare boutique fruits out there we may not be familiar with.
[52:26.590 --> 52:29.170]  We're all we're all caught up in in hot dogs.
[52:29.170 --> 52:33.270]  But maybe maybe there's some rare fruits that we might want to try to experience.
[52:33.490 --> 52:36.150]  I feel like I've seen James Bond defuse that.
[52:36.150 --> 52:39.910]  Yeah, I was gonna say if I ate that fruit, I feel like I would turn into one of those
[52:39.910 --> 52:41.130]  aliens from Annihilation.
[52:41.650 --> 52:43.790]  It looks like something that came out of the shimmer.
[52:44.270 --> 52:45.710]  It looks like Coruscant blowing up.
[52:46.250 --> 52:48.410]  Which bit do you eat of that hollow fruit?
[52:49.030 --> 52:53.390]  I want to find out because the top part looks like broccoli and then the inside looks like a
[52:54.050 --> 52:55.790]  sort of like a jawbreaker, I guess.
[52:56.290 --> 53:02.450]  Yeah, it looks like broccoli that transitions to a carrot into a into a jawbreaker.
[53:02.950 --> 53:04.170]  Yeah, it looks amazing.
[53:04.170 --> 53:07.690]  But that got me thinking like there's a there's probably a lot of rare fruits out there.
[53:07.770 --> 53:08.350]  You know what I mean?
[53:08.890 --> 53:13.970]  Like not every not your pedestrian everyday fruit fruits, fruits that you and I, you guys,
[53:14.150 --> 53:15.750]  we don't even know exist out there.
[53:15.930 --> 53:19.710]  There's fruits that we've never heard of that are delighting people that are in the know.
[53:19.770 --> 53:20.670]  And we're not those people.
[53:20.690 --> 53:22.610]  And I want to be those people.
[53:23.230 --> 53:26.050]  Do you mean rare like there's not a lot of the plants or like that?
[53:26.050 --> 53:27.190]  You just don't see them in America?
[53:27.530 --> 53:28.070]  Yeah, both.
[53:28.150 --> 53:29.310]  Like there's not a lot of them.
[53:29.370 --> 53:29.990]  I mean, rare.
[53:30.230 --> 53:32.030]  I mean, that's the definition of rare.
[53:32.030 --> 53:34.050]  But it fits both of those things you just said.
[53:34.270 --> 53:38.610]  And so, yeah, fruits that you don't that you don't have easy access to.
[53:38.830 --> 53:43.810]  Fruits that like, like maybe someday we could even go on a journey to a fruit.
[53:43.910 --> 53:46.370]  Like maybe there's a fruit that only grows on a mountain somewhere.
[53:46.510 --> 53:51.290]  And we got to go to it to get to that fruit so that we can taste that little bit of joy
[53:51.290 --> 53:52.990]  that no one else on Earth gets to taste.
[53:53.150 --> 53:57.210]  I want to be I want to be like a fruit explorer.
[53:57.770 --> 53:59.870]  I want to be like Lewis and Fruit Clark.
[54:03.530 --> 54:06.150]  Have you ever had that stink fruit?
[54:06.270 --> 54:06.650]  What's it called?
[54:06.750 --> 54:08.030]  The one that's durian fruit.
[54:08.150 --> 54:09.130]  Yeah. Have you ever tried that?
[54:09.210 --> 54:10.110]  No, I never have.
[54:10.170 --> 54:10.810]  I'd love to.
[54:10.990 --> 54:11.470]  I'd love to.
[54:11.590 --> 54:11.990]  We should.
[54:12.410 --> 54:14.090]  I want to expand my fruit horizons.
[54:14.170 --> 54:14.870]  I think we all should.
[54:15.290 --> 54:15.550]  Yeah.
[54:15.790 --> 54:20.430]  And if Gavin wants to get off in some cuckish way doing it, that's fine with me, too.
[54:20.850 --> 54:24.770]  I think the phase one is just going to a grocery store and buying whatever fruit you haven't
[54:24.770 --> 54:25.230]  tried yet.
[54:25.630 --> 54:26.850]  That's a good that's a good state.
[54:26.850 --> 54:27.370]  It's gonna be hard.
[54:27.490 --> 54:31.550]  You got to cover your face for me to go to a grocery store in America and find fruit.
[54:31.550 --> 54:33.610]  I'm not familiar with, but I'm willing to give it a shot.
[54:33.850 --> 54:37.410]  I feel like I've probably tried most regular grocery store fruit, right?
[54:37.510 --> 54:37.850]  Oh, you know what?
[54:37.850 --> 54:39.990]  You've never seen a durian just in your grocery store?
[54:40.450 --> 54:40.870]  You know what?
[54:40.890 --> 54:41.570]  I probably have.
[54:41.630 --> 54:42.310]  I probably have.
[54:42.350 --> 54:44.470]  And I've probably seen like an ugly fruit.
[54:44.710 --> 54:46.030]  There's probably a few out there.
[54:46.270 --> 54:48.130]  We could go to like a Whole Foods.
[54:48.250 --> 54:50.490]  We could go to like maybe an Asian market.
[54:50.770 --> 54:52.990]  Oh, go to like Fiesta and see if there's some stuff.
[54:53.010 --> 54:53.390]  Go to Fiesta.
[54:53.650 --> 54:54.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:54.350 --> 54:56.210]  I bet we could assemble a group of fruits.
[54:56.310 --> 54:57.270]  We've we've never.
[54:57.350 --> 55:00.510]  Maybe that'd be the next time we get together to do live action recording.
[55:00.510 --> 55:04.010]  Maybe we'll assemble a rare fruit tray.
[55:04.230 --> 55:09.530]  Maybe if we're all in Fiesta and we find a fruit that none of us have ever tried,
[55:09.690 --> 55:10.710]  then we have to get it.
[55:10.790 --> 55:12.170]  And we just go around the fruits buying.
[55:12.210 --> 55:12.610]  Oh boy.
[55:13.370 --> 55:15.310]  We're buying one of everything we've never tried.
[55:15.850 --> 55:16.230]  I really like this idea.
[55:16.230 --> 55:16.630]  It's a great idea.
[55:17.390 --> 55:17.830]  Yeah.
[55:18.490 --> 55:19.650]  I got a reply from my mom.
[55:20.330 --> 55:21.110]  Oh, no.
[55:21.750 --> 55:22.510]  What did you ask her?
[55:22.970 --> 55:23.930]  Do you know what cuck is?
[55:25.450 --> 55:26.290]  This is the reply.
[55:26.970 --> 55:27.290]  Sucks.
[55:28.450 --> 55:34.930]  Cuck is a weak or servile man often used as a contemptuous term
[55:34.930 --> 55:38.230]  for a man with moderate or progressive political views.
[55:39.490 --> 55:40.950]  Did she Google this?
[55:41.370 --> 55:42.830]  That was my next text.
[55:43.310 --> 55:43.550]  Yep.
[55:44.170 --> 55:45.490]  Don't ever reply to that.
[55:45.670 --> 55:47.270]  But the answer is sex.
[55:47.390 --> 55:48.370]  No, not not.
[55:48.450 --> 55:49.610]  I don't think she's aware of.
[55:49.790 --> 55:51.230]  I think it falls in that category.
[55:51.710 --> 55:52.210]  I think she's.
[55:52.450 --> 55:52.950]  Oh, wait.
[55:52.990 --> 55:55.270]  Can also be used as being sexual unfaithful.
[55:55.390 --> 55:56.170]  I guess.
[55:56.210 --> 55:56.770]  I don't know.
[55:56.770 --> 55:57.910]  I think she's Googling.
[55:58.030 --> 56:01.810]  Cuck is where you're making your mom Google.
[56:02.950 --> 56:04.850]  This is a little boy.
[56:06.250 --> 56:07.930]  I think she misinterpreted.
[56:07.990 --> 56:10.810]  I think she thought I was asking her to give me the definition.
[56:11.130 --> 56:13.870]  So she she's helping you out.
[56:14.050 --> 56:15.250]  Like, yeah, I think she's helping.
[56:15.790 --> 56:16.710]  I just don't.
[56:16.770 --> 56:20.670]  I just I can't imagine that your mom says servile very often.
[56:20.970 --> 56:22.410]  No, that's how it tipped me.
[56:22.910 --> 56:26.310]  I mean, not many people that are good with nature do in my experience.
[56:32.290 --> 56:32.570]  Oh, Christ.
[56:33.970 --> 56:34.530]  Oh, man.
[56:37.130 --> 56:37.690]  Oh, wow.
[56:37.890 --> 56:38.830]  You got you got more.
[56:38.970 --> 56:40.210]  I was gonna say, should we start wrapping this up?
[56:40.270 --> 56:42.250]  But boy, you got there's more in the chamber.
[56:42.430 --> 56:43.070]  Holy shit.
[56:43.770 --> 56:44.850]  Now we should probably wrap it up.
[56:47.750 --> 56:48.810]  Just one question, though.
[56:48.830 --> 56:49.690]  Just one question, though.
[56:49.730 --> 56:51.470]  OK, you guys were a couple weeks ago.
[56:51.630 --> 56:53.510]  This is something that's been itching at my brain for a while.
[56:53.590 --> 56:54.770]  I've been meaning to get out to you guys.
[56:54.770 --> 56:59.030]  You remember a couple of weeks ago we were talking about how Contra 3, I believe it was,
[56:59.110 --> 57:02.610]  was named Super Probiotic Anal War or whatever.
[57:02.910 --> 57:05.930]  Yeah, Super Probiotecta the Alien Rebels.
[57:06.890 --> 57:08.730]  Super Probiotecta the Alien War.
[57:09.130 --> 57:12.650]  Yeah, but it was Contra everywhere else in the world.
[57:12.710 --> 57:16.950]  Would it be funny if we changed our name in one territory in the world where we were
[57:16.950 --> 57:18.590]  called something else like in Yugoslavia?
[57:18.590 --> 57:19.890]  We're not the regulation podcast.
[57:20.150 --> 57:22.630]  We're Super Probiotic Anal War or whatever.
[57:22.630 --> 57:28.630]  If you're a big fan of regulation podcasts, go to Azerbaijan where it's like
[57:29.260 --> 57:31.430]  Tomb Enforcer Anarchy Maximum.
[57:32.250 --> 57:34.470]  Where it's like Apple Fart Comedy Troupe.
[57:35.630 --> 57:37.770]  Do we have the ability to see?
[57:39.310 --> 57:41.970]  Because Chartable doesn't exist anymore.
[57:42.990 --> 57:45.930]  Do we have a version of Chartable we have access to?
[57:46.350 --> 57:47.530]  Like within the numbers?
[57:48.210 --> 57:50.890]  Do we have that like our demographics other than YouTube?
[57:50.890 --> 57:53.330]  Because we can look at YouTube like we get our demographics from YouTube,
[57:53.450 --> 57:54.330]  and I guess that would be a thing.
[57:54.750 --> 57:58.930]  Yeah, how many how many people from Yugoslavia listen to this podcast?
[57:58.930 --> 58:03.230]  I was going to say there is a time where we were like number one in like Egypt,
[58:03.410 --> 58:06.710]  and it was just clearly like according to Chartable.
[58:07.110 --> 58:09.270]  We're like the number two comedy thing.
[58:09.370 --> 58:12.430]  And it's like, well, you see, that's possible, though, because Egypt is a country.
[58:12.830 --> 58:16.810]  Yeah, I was going to say, why do we keep using Yugoslavia as a standpoint?
[58:17.050 --> 58:19.490]  It hasn't been a country since the 90s.
[58:20.890 --> 58:23.390]  That makes it even funnier.
[58:23.810 --> 58:29.590]  What I'm trying to get at is we should find if there is any a place that is incredibly
[58:31.030 --> 58:34.170]  I was going to say obscure, but I don't even know how you necessarily measure that.
[58:34.270 --> 58:38.430]  A place where we're number one, which I assume is a territory that doesn't have
[58:38.430 --> 58:41.530]  a lot of anything that is being streamed.
[58:42.070 --> 58:45.510]  And that person should be able to rename whatever it is in that territory.
[58:46.030 --> 58:47.850]  We give them the right to the name.
[58:48.790 --> 58:49.550]  I see what you're saying.
[58:49.550 --> 58:52.770]  So we need to find the place and then we need to have that person
[58:52.770 --> 58:57.030]  verify that they are the person listening, putting us in the position,
[58:57.130 --> 58:58.750]  because I assume nobody's streaming.
[58:58.930 --> 59:03.630]  The only way we're number one in any region is if no one else is doing any downloading a podcast.
[59:03.930 --> 59:04.970]  Yeah, what's this person?
[59:06.050 --> 59:10.610]  Yeah, we need to find one person who listens to us on the Seychelles Islands or something.
[59:10.870 --> 59:13.950]  Hey, Germany, almost 3000 downloads.
[59:14.110 --> 59:14.810]  Way to go, boys.
[59:15.190 --> 59:16.650]  Oh, pretty good.
[59:16.730 --> 59:19.210]  But is that one person downloading it 3000 times?
[59:19.550 --> 59:20.490]  Probably not.
[59:20.670 --> 59:23.670]  We have to get a little more granular, I suppose.
[59:23.910 --> 59:27.470]  We have a lot of places that have just one download.
[59:27.530 --> 59:27.790]  Really?
[59:28.310 --> 59:29.870]  Bangladesh, Faroe Islands, Nigeria,
[59:31.770 --> 59:32.790]  Turks and Caicos,
[59:33.470 --> 59:33.930]  Indonesia.
[59:35.050 --> 59:36.670]  We could go to Turks and Caicos.
[59:36.690 --> 59:41.890]  If you're in the Faroe Islands and you're listening to this, will you reach out?
[59:44.030 --> 59:48.810]  If you reside in the Faroe Islands or Turks and Caicos as a backup,
[59:48.810 --> 59:50.430]  please reach out to us and let us know.
[59:50.510 --> 59:52.690]  We'd like to let you rename our podcast in your territory.
[59:53.030 --> 59:54.310]  Oh, yeah, only where you are.
[59:55.050 --> 59:55.950]  Do you think that's what it is?
[59:55.950 --> 59:59.370]  Or is one guy just VPN hopping every week from a different place?
[59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.310]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:02.390]  Who fucking VPNs from the Faroe Islands?
[01:00:04.090 --> 01:00:06.570]  Their Netflix library is crazy.
[01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:12.090]  Honestly, if you VPN to the Faroe Islands, you're easier to find, period.
[01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.950]  My mom just texted me the first use of Cuck was in 1611.
[01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:18.010]  Okay, okay.
[01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:22.750]  All right, we got to cut it off.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.030]  We got it. We got to wrap this up.
[01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:24.710]  This is a mess.
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:28.510]  Hey, thanks for listening to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:29.710]  This was episode 41.
[01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:32.670]  This is probably our 250th episode or so.
[01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.490]  Who can even fucking tell at this point?
[01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:36.090]  Wow.
[01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:38.450]  Can you believe that the Gerplers came out?
[01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:43.530]  Gerpeltine's day was a huge, unmitigated success with zero issues or failures.
[01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:47.810]  And literally every single person on the planet Earth that wanted a Gerpler got one,
[01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.030]  as well as both signs.
[01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:50.050]  That was awesome.
[01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:54.670]  We can't wait to do that again, especially given how everyone was so happy.
[01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:59.590]  And we're just so happy that you spent another hour of your day listening to us
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.690]  fight about absolutely nothing.
[01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:05.310]  And we hope you'll come back next week, kind of like a Cuck,
[01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.930]  and listen to this podcast again.
[01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:07.690]  We'll see ya.
[01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.870]  What?
[01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:09.870]  What?
