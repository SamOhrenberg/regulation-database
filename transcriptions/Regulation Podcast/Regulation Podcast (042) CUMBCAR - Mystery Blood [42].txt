[00:00.000 --> 00:03.540]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.800 --> 00:05.960]  This is episode 42.
[00:06.780 --> 00:07.820]  I am your host.
[00:07.960 --> 00:12.840]  My name is Baby Pepsi and with me as always, Gassy Goo,
[00:13.000 --> 00:16.400]  the Mechanic, Lil Ricky B and Gizmo.
[00:18.100 --> 00:20.920]  That's the first time I get to officially use our new nicknames,
[00:21.000 --> 00:25.000]  and I was so scared I was going to fuck it up this morning that I watched the
[00:25.000 --> 00:28.700]  I watched the nickname draft again the last 10 minutes
[00:28.700 --> 00:30.940]  just to make sure I had them all right, and then I practiced
[00:30.940 --> 00:34.600]  and then I still almost fucked it up on my name out the gate.
[00:35.020 --> 00:36.040]  I played you great.
[00:36.580 --> 00:38.240]  Yeah, God, you did fantastic.
[00:38.460 --> 00:40.280]  On the outside, I might have done well on the inside.
[00:40.420 --> 00:41.760]  It was a dumpster fire.
[00:42.280 --> 00:43.880]  It was great. It came across great.
[00:44.040 --> 00:46.640]  I'm can we say before we really get going into this episode?
[00:46.960 --> 00:49.400]  I'm alarmed that Gavin is here. I'm very worried.
[00:49.960 --> 00:52.540]  I don't trust him being clean right now.
[00:52.960 --> 00:56.140]  And he texted you or someone.
[00:56.140 --> 00:57.300]  I don't know if it was a slap.
[00:57.540 --> 00:58.860]  He slacked it.
[00:59.100 --> 01:03.740]  Once again, he declared an emergency poo one minute before
[01:04.400 --> 01:05.760]  we were supposed to start.
[01:05.960 --> 01:11.360]  And then he showed up like 40 seconds later, which I don't understand.
[01:11.840 --> 01:15.620]  I didn't start the emergency poo at ten fifty nine.
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.500]  I was just like, you know, I was still dealing with one.
[01:18.600 --> 01:22.060]  Yeah, but the fact that you showed up so soon, the fact that you felt the need
[01:22.060 --> 01:27.720]  to alert us that that was occurring yet still showed up.
[01:27.820 --> 01:28.440]  Well, let's be fair.
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.920]  I I know how long it takes me to wipe and I was budgeting accordingly.
[01:33.320 --> 01:34.240]  How long does it take?
[01:34.580 --> 01:35.540]  How long does it take you to wipe?
[01:36.080 --> 01:37.180]  Probably do it for a minute.
[01:37.960 --> 01:39.240]  That's a lot of wiping, dude.
[01:39.600 --> 01:41.660]  You must have a raw asshole.
[01:41.900 --> 01:45.200]  We also know, though, however, that Gavin has a system worked out
[01:45.200 --> 01:48.160]  where he doesn't have to wash his hands after he goes to the bathroom
[01:48.620 --> 01:51.200]  because they don't they never touch anything other than his phone, apparently.
[01:51.200 --> 01:53.440]  So I guess that cuts down on time.
[01:53.960 --> 01:56.100]  That's for a specific bog and only for piss.
[01:56.620 --> 01:59.240]  And I still and the whole point is I still wash my hands anyway.
[01:59.340 --> 02:00.700]  I'm just saying I don't have to.
[02:01.620 --> 02:02.340]  Why bother?
[02:03.060 --> 02:06.520]  Why bother? Because just I wash my hands a bunch every day.
[02:06.840 --> 02:09.560]  Can I can I ask a can I ask a personal question?
[02:09.880 --> 02:17.220]  You can you feel free not to answer this when you do podcast poo like this.
[02:17.220 --> 02:21.240]  Are you using your knuckle method or is this no need for the knuckle method?
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.580]  I was wondering that as well.
[02:22.920 --> 02:24.100]  No, that's no need or not.
[02:24.320 --> 02:25.300]  Well, you do both.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.680]  You don't you don't do one.
[02:26.880 --> 02:28.460]  Just one. You do both.
[02:28.920 --> 02:30.520]  Yeah, you do both when you poo. Both knuckles?
[02:30.920 --> 02:33.760]  I don't think I've ever taken a shit and not peed in my life.
[02:34.080 --> 02:34.840]  Yeah. Oh, no.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.200]  I'm saying if if there's poo involved, I don't knuckle.
[02:37.880 --> 02:39.440]  Hmm. Don't trust it.
[02:40.300 --> 02:42.900]  You also said something you said something I thought was interesting
[02:42.900 --> 02:45.480]  a few seconds ago on the why bother front.
[02:45.480 --> 02:50.200]  You said, uh, yeah, I don't have to wash my hands, but I do anyway.
[02:50.360 --> 02:52.780]  I wash my hands tons of a bunch of times a day.
[02:52.800 --> 02:53.140]  Why bother?
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.160]  Why bother going through the process of telling us
[02:55.160 --> 02:57.400]  you could get through using the bathroom without washing your hands
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.160]  if you're also going to wash your hands?
[02:59.480 --> 03:01.480]  Yeah, the discussion was with Meg.
[03:01.560 --> 03:03.440]  I was like, look, surely I don't have to do this.
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.600]  But I I didn't ever just not ever wash my hands.
[03:08.420 --> 03:12.000]  Why? What did who the conversation was with have to do with anything?
[03:13.920 --> 03:15.540]  Is Meg in the room with us right now?
[03:16.000 --> 03:18.560]  Yeah. As a that's a weird clarification.
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.320]  Well, like sometimes, right?
[03:21.760 --> 03:26.060]  Sometimes Geoff will say something about a conversation with Emily or Eric.
[03:26.280 --> 03:28.020]  Why are you going to drag my wife into this?
[03:28.260 --> 03:32.680]  Small wife. I'm just saying that was the person who I had the conversation
[03:32.680 --> 03:35.160]  with about, holy shit, don't you have to wash my hands?
[03:35.460 --> 03:36.240]  I'm just enjoying.
[03:36.340 --> 03:38.900]  I said one thing and we're all going at you for different things.
[03:38.960 --> 03:40.020]  I'm just trying to add on to it.
[03:40.080 --> 03:41.140]  And I'm really enjoying it.
[03:41.140 --> 03:42.740]  As someone who's typically on the back foot.
[03:43.360 --> 03:46.720]  I would say the audience is pretty on board with the old the knuckling.
[03:47.280 --> 03:48.320]  I was on board with the knuckling.
[03:48.500 --> 03:49.360]  Not that they do it with a knuckle.
[03:49.880 --> 03:51.720]  Yeah, it's just the way you said it.
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.220]  Wait, what was wrong with the way I said it?
[03:54.300 --> 03:55.040]  You said it.
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.700]  I think everyone I don't understand everyone.
[03:57.740 --> 03:58.820]  Obviously, that's not true.
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.600]  But I feel the majority of people I saw vocalize.
[04:02.720 --> 04:05.120]  They agreed with you, but that you described it in a poor way.
[04:06.220 --> 04:07.400]  Well, what's new there?
[04:07.640 --> 04:10.760]  The only reason the knuckle came into it is because I was trying to invent
[04:11.660 --> 04:14.700]  a bidet attachment that just had a little knuckle on it that came out.
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.220]  It could have been anything.
[04:16.340 --> 04:17.160]  It could have been a ball.
[04:17.440 --> 04:19.560]  It could have been a fingertip.
[04:20.420 --> 04:24.180]  You know, we were saying that we could we could invent the tool.
[04:24.320 --> 04:25.880]  Emily was saying you should call it a moose knuckle.
[04:26.060 --> 04:28.560]  But I was just thinking you could call it a goose knuckle.
[04:28.660 --> 04:31.000]  Wait, why? Why are you bringing Emily into this?
[04:31.720 --> 04:33.660]  Hell, yeah, because I want to get out of here.
[04:33.800 --> 04:36.160]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.880]  I wanted to give her credit for the idea that I then modified.
[04:39.880 --> 04:41.400]  He was explaining.
[04:41.560 --> 04:44.360]  I don't want to context of it, where your reference to that.
[04:44.480 --> 04:47.740]  You had a conversation with Meg was said in a defensive tone
[04:47.740 --> 04:51.580]  as if that somehow clarified something where it was just really
[04:52.120 --> 04:54.060]  an additional piece of info that was irrelevant.
[04:54.200 --> 04:56.420]  If this keeps the fight going, I'm on Gavin's side.
[05:00.480 --> 05:02.100]  So has anyone tried it in between?
[05:03.060 --> 05:03.980]  No, no.
[05:04.860 --> 05:06.920]  I mean, I kind of have my own
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.260]  pull and tug and shake.
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.340]  So you go, you pretty much deal with the penis.
[05:12.860 --> 05:14.420]  Yeah, I mostly just deal with the penis.
[05:14.580 --> 05:18.760]  I don't really I don't really fuck with the the gooch that much.
[05:19.360 --> 05:22.860]  I mostly just like pull and tug and yank and shake and go, God damn it.
[05:22.900 --> 05:25.600]  Dude, stop. Just stop dripping.
[05:26.160 --> 05:28.740]  Be done. For fuck's sake, be done.
[05:29.240 --> 05:30.740]  Nick has his own method as well.
[05:31.260 --> 05:33.740]  OK, well, yeah, it's like Geoff's like, come on, let's go.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.500]  I got shit to do. Get the drips out.
[05:35.500 --> 05:37.420]  And how long are we dripping for, typically?
[05:38.660 --> 05:41.420]  You add like four seconds every year of age.
[05:41.640 --> 05:46.400]  Yeah. At this point, at this point, I drip way longer than I pee.
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.540]  Oh, not that bad yet.
[05:49.580 --> 05:52.780]  I think people got the wrong end of the stick because I was talking about
[05:52.780 --> 05:55.160]  going from the back with the bidet.
[05:55.340 --> 05:59.000]  I don't ever touch any of that from behind. Right.
[05:59.060 --> 06:00.900]  I don't even have to touch my skin.
[06:01.120 --> 06:03.760]  I can do it through my boxes, urinal.
[06:03.760 --> 06:09.380]  I could just get a finger, you know, up by the balls through the boxes,
[06:09.680 --> 06:12.440]  give it a little and then I'm done.
[06:13.100 --> 06:17.060]  My issue is never with the journey as much as it was the location.
[06:17.240 --> 06:18.760]  And you can't really change that.
[06:19.820 --> 06:22.260]  You can tell me you're going north, you're going east.
[06:22.340 --> 06:23.320]  It doesn't really matter.
[06:23.560 --> 06:25.020]  It's where we're landing is.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.640]  Yeah, it was less about the approach and more about the destination.
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.800]  But I mean, we can change it up if you want.
[06:32.800 --> 06:35.480]  You tell me we're going, we're going a different direction.
[06:35.740 --> 06:37.160]  We're going to go up the right leg.
[06:37.220 --> 06:38.540]  We're going to hook around the thigh.
[06:38.800 --> 06:40.860]  We're going to go up over the belly button.
[06:43.340 --> 06:47.340]  I what about if it was just the toilet seat that shocked you?
[06:47.920 --> 06:49.280]  They gave you a little electric shock.
[06:49.320 --> 06:50.380]  How do you feel about that?
[06:50.540 --> 06:52.920]  What? What does it do?
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.220]  It shocks you.
[06:54.380 --> 06:56.380]  I felt that part was very clear.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.640]  Why does it work?
[06:58.040 --> 06:59.220]  So you get the pee out.
[06:59.460 --> 07:00.960]  Sucks. Oh, this sucks.
[07:00.960 --> 07:02.960]  You think you electrocute the piss out?
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.220]  Yeah, I think you could.
[07:04.360 --> 07:07.740]  I think you could surprise yourself and go, oh, and, you know,
[07:07.800 --> 07:10.740]  your body like tenses up and then you get all the drips out.
[07:10.980 --> 07:13.140]  It's easier to change in underwear. I'll do it.
[07:14.280 --> 07:20.100]  So if I sit on a couple of shock collars and see if it helps get the dregs out.
[07:21.240 --> 07:22.820]  If you have a good test for you,
[07:24.100 --> 07:29.140]  if you put if you put an anti-bark collar on your ass and farted,
[07:29.140 --> 07:30.200]  would you shock yourself?
[07:30.600 --> 07:32.160]  Would that be enough to trigger it?
[07:32.700 --> 07:33.660]  What detects that bark?
[07:33.760 --> 07:36.640]  I don't know. Is it sound? Is it vibration?
[07:37.280 --> 07:39.860]  I have no clue what causes those things to shock,
[07:39.940 --> 07:43.120]  but I never thought of if you could activate one via a fart.
[07:43.660 --> 07:44.900]  But that's very funny to me.
[07:45.460 --> 07:48.040]  What if we collared Geoff's testicles with a shock collar?
[07:49.460 --> 07:50.860]  That's not necessary. That's not necessary.
[07:50.980 --> 07:51.600]  We don't need to do that.
[07:51.680 --> 07:54.180]  What we need to do is we need to do it and I'll do it if you do it.
[07:54.200 --> 07:55.900]  OK, I'll do it if you do it.
[07:56.380 --> 08:01.560]  I go in, I stand at the urinal and I pee, and as soon as I wrap up
[08:01.560 --> 08:06.260]  and I begin the dripping, shaking, pulling, pleading, begging process,
[08:06.620 --> 08:09.000]  you electrocute me with a stun gun in the back.
[08:09.480 --> 08:12.680]  And then we'll see what happens.
[08:13.180 --> 08:14.540]  And then I'll do it to you.
[08:14.920 --> 08:16.800]  And then we'll that way.
[08:16.860 --> 08:19.460]  That way we both get stung on to the urinal.
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.020]  It's we're both miserable.
[08:21.380 --> 08:25.680]  We did. And we we have two people sample size to determine the success of it.
[08:25.900 --> 08:28.880]  There's no way to just bang my cock into the ceramic.
[08:29.300 --> 08:30.360]  We'll see. I don't know.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.140]  We don't know. It would be a low voltage.
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.040]  We'll do it on a low one.
[08:33.420 --> 08:38.800]  Yeah, I think just the fear that you could be zapped would be enough.
[08:40.320 --> 08:43.400]  I think having someone stand behind you with a stun gun
[08:43.400 --> 08:46.040]  and you know it's possible that they might shoot you with it
[08:46.040 --> 08:48.080]  would get you record drip time.
[08:48.460 --> 08:49.420]  Maybe that's what we need.
[08:49.500 --> 08:52.180]  Maybe we need to do a religion style and just rule by fear.
[08:52.700 --> 08:53.660]  Oh, yeah.
[08:53.760 --> 08:57.080]  Just every bathroom has a stun gun that that zooms out
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.700]  as soon as you start pulling up your underwear.
[09:00.120 --> 09:01.480]  Nestles in right next to your butt.
[09:02.560 --> 09:06.540]  I think the thing I'm most suspicious of is that Eric is of an age
[09:07.120 --> 09:09.480]  very similar to the amount of podcasts we've done
[09:09.480 --> 09:13.280]  and is still doing all of his squeezing internally, apparently.
[09:13.820 --> 09:15.380]  Yep. How do you do that?
[09:15.760 --> 09:18.380]  You just sort of, you know, keep it healthy.
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.920]  You keep it healthy.
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.980]  I feel like a squeezer would agree with my shock method.
[09:23.020 --> 09:23.860]  Eric, how do you feel?
[09:24.020 --> 09:27.240]  I don't I don't know why you you're insane.
[09:27.520 --> 09:31.800]  Put an electric toilet seat and then zap your ass to get.
[09:31.960 --> 09:33.580]  But it doesn't happen every time.
[09:34.240 --> 09:35.940]  I think it only happens sometimes.
[09:36.880 --> 09:38.580]  I don't want it to happen any times, Andrew.
[09:38.760 --> 09:39.940]  It does not need to happen ever.
[09:40.080 --> 09:40.760]  I don't think.
[09:41.080 --> 09:42.500]  Yeah, you do like a little bit squeezing.
[09:42.620 --> 09:45.600]  Sometimes you just got to like you kind of stand there for an extra
[09:45.600 --> 09:48.660]  like little bit and give it a like a little bit of time.
[09:48.660 --> 09:50.640]  But you just sort of internal squeezing.
[09:51.140 --> 09:53.480]  Do you do internal squeezing throughout the day?
[09:53.940 --> 09:55.960]  What do you mean? I'm asking Gavin.
[09:57.180 --> 09:58.520]  Like the kegels?
[09:58.960 --> 10:02.260]  Yeah. Not really.
[10:02.320 --> 10:02.860]  Am I supposed to?
[10:03.340 --> 10:06.140]  I mean, I think it's like working a muscle a little bit, isn't it?
[10:06.480 --> 10:07.920]  You don't work out your kegel muscles?
[10:08.420 --> 10:09.500]  I don't really think to.
[10:10.260 --> 10:11.140]  Hmm. Hmm.
[10:11.580 --> 10:12.480]  How's that working out for you?
[10:13.080 --> 10:14.680]  Yeah, maybe I should. So what's your routine?
[10:14.920 --> 10:16.340]  How many reps? The answer is not well.
[10:16.400 --> 10:17.760]  He's fingering his asshole.
[10:19.460 --> 10:21.340]  I'm not. I'm not doing reps.
[10:21.480 --> 10:24.220]  Sometimes you just got to, you know, if you're just kind of like sitting,
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.120]  you sit and squeeze.
[10:25.640 --> 10:27.220]  But Gavin, I'm going to be honest with you.
[10:27.560 --> 10:30.780]  The whole time we're talking right now, brother, I'm squeezing.
[10:32.860 --> 10:34.500]  I did it for a second, but I got tired.
[10:35.340 --> 10:36.060]  It's exhausting.
[10:36.820 --> 10:38.040]  Just put a shock seat.
[10:38.200 --> 10:40.820]  I got to be honest, I didn't think we'd be this far into this episode
[10:40.820 --> 10:42.760]  still talking about Gavin's bathroom.
[10:42.940 --> 10:45.580]  I figured we'd be talking nicknames way more than we have.
[10:45.580 --> 10:48.900]  And we just went right into a finger in butts or whatever.
[10:49.040 --> 10:51.360]  I got one last thing on toilets and then I'm going to move on.
[10:52.240 --> 10:54.700]  Do we do you think there's a way?
[10:56.340 --> 10:57.140]  That, hmm.
[10:57.600 --> 10:59.280]  You know, fingerprints are identifiable.
[10:59.780 --> 11:03.260]  Is there anything on our ass that makes us uniquely identifiable?
[11:03.780 --> 11:04.380]  I have a mole.
[11:05.940 --> 11:08.320]  Oh, I guess they'd be scanning.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.400]  I don't know how I'd feel about that.
[11:09.700 --> 11:12.280]  I was thinking about if you have a shock toilet seat,
[11:12.740 --> 11:16.960]  you might not necessarily want everybody in your household to be part of it.
[11:17.340 --> 11:20.640]  So if there's a way like you could sit on it and it like registers
[11:20.640 --> 11:23.040]  your cheeks, yeah, like a butt thumbprint.
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.260]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure the anus is pretty unique
[11:25.260 --> 11:28.180]  because there was that service, wasn't there, that turned your anus
[11:28.180 --> 11:29.180]  into little chocolates.
[11:29.520 --> 11:31.680]  I don't want it to scan my anus, though.
[11:32.020 --> 11:32.840]  That's too personal.
[11:33.600 --> 11:34.400]  I don't like, hmm.
[11:35.980 --> 11:38.180]  That'd be a really funny thing, though, to see fingerprints
[11:38.180 --> 11:41.000]  and anal print on a seat for a criminal.
[11:42.100 --> 11:43.860]  Sir, sir, we swept the whole place.
[11:44.020 --> 11:44.780]  Did you get any fingerprints?
[11:45.060 --> 11:47.500]  No. And you're not going to like what I have to say next.
[11:48.060 --> 11:49.820]  His anus was all over the place.
[11:50.100 --> 11:51.880]  He was beheaded so we couldn't get dental records.
[11:52.020 --> 11:53.740]  But thank God they left the anus intact.
[11:54.500 --> 11:57.360]  I just thought they were dusting down a doorknob and being like,
[11:57.800 --> 11:58.700]  this isn't fingers.
[12:03.500 --> 12:05.840]  Oh, man. Hey, we have there's two things
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.180]  I'd like to talk about today, if you guys don't mind.
[12:07.280 --> 12:08.800]  One, I would like to talk about a recent,
[12:09.540 --> 12:13.200]  I don't know, a heartbreak or setback that the company has had.
[12:13.700 --> 12:14.820]  Maybe we can discuss.
[12:15.360 --> 12:17.620]  And then the second thing I'd like to talk about at some point today.
[12:17.700 --> 12:18.460]  Just don't let me forget.
[12:18.680 --> 12:24.360]  I am in a deja vu nightmare that I cannot seem to break out of this week.
[12:24.880 --> 12:28.060]  And it's making it's making nighttime
[12:29.040 --> 12:29.980]  miserable for me.
[12:30.420 --> 12:32.680]  Do do I know about the company heartbreak?
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.440]  I think you do. Yeah.
[12:34.680 --> 12:36.060]  Yeah, we can cover that real fast.
[12:36.320 --> 12:38.340]  But, you know, we've been talking a lot about getting an office.
[12:38.340 --> 12:40.860]  And that being something that we're working towards.
[12:40.980 --> 12:45.460]  We have we don't like to announce announcements, if at all possible.
[12:45.460 --> 12:49.040]  We don't like to talk, you know, get too far ahead of our skis on this stuff.
[12:49.240 --> 12:52.000]  But we had been making a lot of progress in the background.
[12:52.100 --> 12:54.700]  So much progress, in fact, that we found an office.
[12:55.140 --> 12:57.260]  We toured it three times.
[12:58.760 --> 13:03.080]  Went ahead and put in an application, got approved for the application.
[13:03.360 --> 13:05.620]  I paid the deposit.
[13:06.180 --> 13:08.820]  And while I was waiting for the lease to sign,
[13:09.240 --> 13:13.300]  the landlord decided not to rent to us and we lost the place.
[13:13.560 --> 13:14.840]  And we don't really know why.
[13:14.920 --> 13:15.800]  It's kind of a bummer.
[13:16.200 --> 13:17.020]  It's more than a bummer.
[13:17.100 --> 13:20.460]  It really sucks because it was about three to four weeks.
[13:20.580 --> 13:23.880]  It's basically all of January behind the scenes.
[13:23.880 --> 13:25.880]  We're running around looking at properties.
[13:26.280 --> 13:28.700]  And Eric and I specifically were dealing with a real
[13:29.620 --> 13:32.200]  like landlords and real estate agents and a tenant.
[13:32.440 --> 13:35.140]  And I had to put in a lot of time in with this tenant.
[13:35.620 --> 13:36.760]  To get in his good graces.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.180]  It was a whole thing.
[13:38.600 --> 13:42.760]  And just like the rug got pulled out from under us at the eleventh and a half hour.
[13:42.940 --> 13:43.780]  And I just...
[13:43.780 --> 13:46.520]  We tested a lot of the walks to coffee shops and stuff.
[13:46.760 --> 13:48.960]  We did. We were all over the neighborhood.
[13:49.360 --> 13:51.720]  We had started to plan where stuff was going to go.
[13:52.060 --> 13:55.300]  It was the really frustrating thing was it was a perfect space for us.
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.700]  Like it was it checked off literally every single need we had
[14:00.260 --> 14:01.480]  and was affordable.
[14:01.700 --> 14:05.340]  And it just sucks because now we're back to, you know, we're back to zero.
[14:05.340 --> 14:06.820]  And we have to start all over again.
[14:07.380 --> 14:10.380]  And so that's a little pier behind the curtain of stuff that we, you know,
[14:10.420 --> 14:13.360]  that was going on in January that we weren't really talking about publicly
[14:13.360 --> 14:15.820]  because we wanted to get the office first before we brought it up.
[14:15.880 --> 14:18.520]  And because we were so excited about it, you know,
[14:19.420 --> 14:21.340]  and then we fucking lost it.
[14:21.620 --> 14:26.840]  Do you think the owner listened to regulation 41 and just decided?
[14:27.600 --> 14:30.040]  Genuinely, no, I don't think it had anything to do with that.
[14:30.080 --> 14:32.260]  We also lost it before 41 came out.
[14:32.300 --> 14:34.380]  So it would have been 40 that did us in.
[14:34.380 --> 14:37.760]  What I think happened is I think the landlord decided
[14:37.760 --> 14:42.120]  they wanted to sell the place and I wanted they wanted to give us a short lease.
[14:42.180 --> 14:43.320]  And I pushed back on that.
[14:43.420 --> 14:44.920]  And I wanted at least a year lease.
[14:45.040 --> 14:46.460]  And that's where we lost it,
[14:46.640 --> 14:48.880]  which is ludicrous to ask for anything less than a year lease.
[14:48.940 --> 14:51.920]  So I think it probably means they were just trying to have a stopgap solution
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.900]  until they were ready to put the place on the market and sell it.
[14:55.320 --> 14:57.820]  Yeah, I was so excited initially when you said that we got rejected
[14:57.820 --> 14:59.960]  because I thought it would be for content reasons.
[15:00.140 --> 15:01.680]  And that's very funny.
[15:01.680 --> 15:04.560]  The premise of at the final hour being like,
[15:04.620 --> 15:08.920]  maybe I should look into this a little bit and seeing you with a jackhammer
[15:08.920 --> 15:11.220]  in your backyard making a beanhole.
[15:11.500 --> 15:14.220]  And then being like, no, no.
[15:14.480 --> 15:18.040]  Nick was luckily the hot dogs on the on the fan hadn't come out yet.
[15:19.440 --> 15:21.040]  Nick said it was probably cum related.
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.380]  It might have been. Who knows?
[15:22.480 --> 15:26.360]  But we definitely we definitely lost our office and we don't have one.
[15:26.440 --> 15:29.220]  And now we're if you if you know of an office in Austin,
[15:29.820 --> 15:32.700]  you let Eric know we'll get another one.
[15:33.220 --> 15:35.060]  Please don't let Eric know, thank you.
[15:36.580 --> 15:40.740]  I did. I did the benefit for you of looking at some research of some office
[15:40.740 --> 15:42.420]  buildings. Thanks, man. Yeah, I appreciate it.
[15:42.420 --> 15:43.680]  Really appreciate it. Thank you so much.
[15:44.260 --> 15:45.660]  Keep it to yourself. Appreciate you.
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.520]  Anyway, it's I bring it up more just to tell you guys a little bit
[15:49.520 --> 15:53.640]  of behind the scenes, a little like a little squeeze of sausage out of the tube.
[15:53.820 --> 15:57.180]  But also just to show you that it's it's been a really successful, wild,
[15:57.180 --> 16:00.820]  wonderful launch and things have gone incredibly well and almost every front.
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.780]  And this is just an example of one that didn't work out for us.
[16:04.160 --> 16:05.080]  That's very true.
[16:05.560 --> 16:06.360]  I'd throw that out there.
[16:06.720 --> 16:08.260]  What would be the name of our office?
[16:09.200 --> 16:12.660]  Cumhouse. Oh, we're in the cum era.
[16:13.300 --> 16:14.920]  No, I don't know. I really don't.
[16:15.100 --> 16:19.220]  That happened. That happened outside of main regulation canon.
[16:19.360 --> 16:23.420]  But that was if you're interested in the origins of cum with a B,
[16:23.500 --> 16:26.600]  that was from our Mario Party Gerpal Tynes Day stream.
[16:27.260 --> 16:28.640]  Eight thousand dollars.
[16:28.940 --> 16:30.520]  Eight thousand dollars.
[16:30.900 --> 16:33.100]  And that's the scenario was eight grand.
[16:33.320 --> 16:35.580]  But you have to spell cum with a silent B at the end.
[16:36.580 --> 16:37.340]  And for the rest of your life.
[16:37.760 --> 16:38.620]  Yeah, I've done it.
[16:38.660 --> 16:41.260]  I've done a lot of these, you know, a million dollars, but which was.
[16:42.200 --> 16:44.200]  Quite involved. It's a big life change.
[16:44.340 --> 16:48.560]  I like the idea of little dreggy amounts that would make a huge difference
[16:48.560 --> 16:50.000]  to like a year.
[16:50.120 --> 16:52.980]  But over the span of your lifetime, you wouldn't even be able to notice.
[16:53.960 --> 16:56.420]  I I'm really curious to know what you consider
[16:57.180 --> 16:58.560]  like canon content.
[16:59.320 --> 17:00.140]  Regulation podcast.
[17:00.480 --> 17:02.300]  Just that it's just the podcast.
[17:02.680 --> 17:04.740]  Well, some people don't.
[17:04.940 --> 17:06.600]  Don't even talk about gameplay stuff. Absolutely.
[17:07.020 --> 17:08.900]  Yeah, it's just that was like a big Gerp alert.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.980]  Like, I feel like that was a big event stream for us.
[17:12.640 --> 17:14.440]  That that feels like if it was if it was.
[17:14.800 --> 17:18.000]  Yeah, like if any supplemental content would be considered canon,
[17:18.060 --> 17:20.740]  I feel like that would be the one because it was a direct response
[17:20.740 --> 17:23.400]  to something that happened on the podcast.
[17:23.520 --> 17:25.560]  I was just curious if you had specific like.
[17:25.560 --> 17:29.320]  Because I've never considered like what is or isn't mainline
[17:29.320 --> 17:30.720]  canon for this podcast.
[17:30.960 --> 17:32.720]  I think that's an interesting thought.
[17:33.360 --> 17:37.540]  Well, I mean, it leaks into the canon because I actually have a request of Geoff.
[17:38.300 --> 17:40.280]  Oh, we got some canon leakage.
[17:40.740 --> 17:44.840]  Yeah. Can I can I make a request for the license plate of my car?
[17:45.400 --> 17:47.080]  Oh, yeah. You can make a request.
[17:49.020 --> 17:50.460]  You want come car?
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.920]  Yeah. Let's see if it's available.
[17:55.160 --> 17:56.720]  Yeah, we'll see if it's available.
[17:57.360 --> 18:02.300]  And yeah. C-U-M-B-C-A-R.
[18:03.220 --> 18:07.680]  Maybe if we spell it C-U-M-B space B-C-A-R, they'll fall for it.
[18:09.940 --> 18:10.640]  Cumby car.
[18:18.660 --> 18:23.100]  When you look at any successful business, you always just see the front end of it.
[18:23.100 --> 18:27.120]  Well, you don't necessarily think about is what is powering that business.
[18:27.260 --> 18:30.380]  And that's why I am here to tell you about Shopify.
[18:30.760 --> 18:35.340]  They power businesses to allow them to be the powerhouses
[18:35.340 --> 18:37.680]  that you see from the outside.
[18:37.980 --> 18:40.480]  But what's underneath the hood is Shopify.
[18:40.840 --> 18:44.620]  Let me tell you that nobody does selling better than Shopify.
[18:44.940 --> 18:45.720]  They're amazing.
[18:45.820 --> 18:47.800]  They have so many systems and tools you can use.
[18:47.960 --> 18:50.520]  They are absolutely fantastic service.
[18:50.520 --> 18:54.000]  They're the home of the number one checkout on the planet.
[18:54.720 --> 18:56.880]  I mean, if you're trying to do any form of checkout,
[18:56.980 --> 18:59.820]  why would you not want to use the number one checkout?
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.720]  It's it's the best.
[19:00.820 --> 19:04.160]  And also they have the not so secret secret,
[19:04.560 --> 19:08.780]  which is shop pay that boost conversions up to 50 percent.
[19:09.080 --> 19:10.920]  That's an amazing statistic.
[19:11.480 --> 19:14.360]  I mean, if nobody's buying from your store,
[19:14.460 --> 19:16.980]  what even is the point of having a store?
[19:16.980 --> 19:21.340]  What it means is way less carts going abandoned and way more sales going.
[19:22.100 --> 19:25.640]  So if you're into growing your business, your commerce platform
[19:25.640 --> 19:28.840]  better be ready to sell wherever your customers are scrolling
[19:28.840 --> 19:34.200]  or strolling on the web and your store and their feed and everywhere in between.
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.040]  You need to be accessible to people.
[19:36.180 --> 19:38.640]  That's the whole point of having a store consumers
[19:38.640 --> 19:40.200]  with so many different competitors.
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.720]  Consumers will come to you if you make it easy for them.
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.320]  And that's what Shopify does.
[19:46.860 --> 19:50.140]  Businesses that sell more sell on Shopify.
[19:50.800 --> 19:54.860]  What I love about Shopify is no matter what your goals are,
[19:54.940 --> 19:57.280]  they have the tools to allow you to get there.
[19:57.400 --> 20:00.080]  Whether you're starting a small business,
[20:00.240 --> 20:03.260]  whether you're operating something massive,
[20:03.640 --> 20:07.600]  they are the partner that you would want and taking you to whatever level
[20:07.600 --> 20:08.560]  your goal is.
[20:08.980 --> 20:12.200]  Upgrade your business and get the same checkout that we have
[20:12.200 --> 20:15.280]  and sign up for your one dollar per month trial
[20:15.280 --> 20:18.760]  at Shopify.com slash face, all lowercase.
[20:18.960 --> 20:21.520]  Go to Shopify.com slash face to upgrade.
[20:21.660 --> 20:23.100]  You're selling today.
[20:23.640 --> 20:25.740]  Shopify.com slash face.
[20:28.520 --> 20:30.000]  So you're in deja vu, Geoff.
[20:30.260 --> 20:31.040]  Oh, my God.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.400]  Oh, all right.
[20:32.480 --> 20:33.640]  This story is a little raw.
[20:33.720 --> 20:36.820]  I haven't like I haven't sure I haven't thought exactly how to tell it yet.
[20:36.820 --> 20:38.640]  So I apologize if it's a little meandering.
[20:38.640 --> 20:43.760]  But Sunday night, I go to bed, go to sleep,
[20:44.160 --> 20:45.480]  probably at one or two in the morning.
[20:45.560 --> 20:48.140]  So I've been playing Warzone with the truck boys every night.
[20:49.000 --> 20:52.100]  And at like maybe three, three thirty, I get up to take a piss.
[20:52.120 --> 20:57.060]  As as most men my age do, I go into my my bathroom and take a piss.
[20:57.220 --> 20:58.300]  Pitch black, of course. Right.
[20:58.320 --> 21:00.660]  But, you know, you you know how to move around your room at night.
[21:01.260 --> 21:03.040]  And and I take a piss like normal.
[21:03.200 --> 21:07.120]  And as I'm coming back to my bed, I'm standing next to my nightstand
[21:07.120 --> 21:10.640]  about to get in my mouth is dry because I have this stupid
[21:11.860 --> 21:12.580]  what do you call it?
[21:12.620 --> 21:14.300]  Like mouth guard I have to use every night now.
[21:15.260 --> 21:18.960]  And and I and I as I'm getting into bed, I see next to my nightstand,
[21:19.020 --> 21:21.900]  there's a white monster energy drink sitting there.
[21:22.040 --> 21:22.900]  I think that I had put there
[21:22.900 --> 21:25.440]  literally at like eight thirty in the morning when I was getting ready
[21:25.440 --> 21:26.320]  and forgot about it.
[21:26.540 --> 21:28.040]  And it just sat there all day.
[21:28.460 --> 21:32.280]  And I thought, oh, I'll just grab some of that to wet my mouth down
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.800]  and then go back to bed. Right.
[21:34.800 --> 21:38.580]  And so I went to grab it and I and I pick it up and I drink it.
[21:38.920 --> 21:39.540]  Just a little swig.
[21:39.820 --> 21:41.120]  And then I put it back on the nightstand.
[21:41.240 --> 21:44.920]  But somehow I put it on the nightstand wrong and it falls over
[21:44.920 --> 21:48.580]  and it spills an entire giant white monster.
[21:48.580 --> 21:52.180]  It's like going all down the floor.
[21:52.280 --> 21:55.200]  It's hit hardwood floor, a rug.
[21:56.020 --> 21:56.900]  It's everywhere.
[21:57.060 --> 22:00.220]  And it spills. It hits me in my jammies.
[22:00.220 --> 22:05.600]  So I'm covered in white monster jeans now on my sticky on my pants and my shirt.
[22:06.040 --> 22:09.360]  And Emily and the dog are sleep snoring loudly next to me.
[22:09.400 --> 22:10.960]  Right. And so I'm like, it's dark.
[22:11.300 --> 22:13.600]  I can't turn the lights on because I don't want Emily.
[22:14.380 --> 22:15.680]  Emily has to get up and go to work in the morning.
[22:15.760 --> 22:16.840]  And Emily works hard days.
[22:16.940 --> 22:17.800]  And it's just 12 hour days.
[22:18.060 --> 22:20.000]  I try to be very respectful of that.
[22:20.200 --> 22:22.260]  And then if the dog wakes up, who knows?
[22:22.380 --> 22:24.920]  You know, if he gets up, then it's we're all fucked. Right.
[22:24.940 --> 22:26.660]  He's he's a hard sleep. He's a heavy sleeper.
[22:26.660 --> 22:27.620]  But once he's awake, he's awake.
[22:28.160 --> 22:30.960]  And so I just like I'm like, fuck, what do I do?
[22:31.040 --> 22:33.440]  I'm not the kind of person that can leave it till morning.
[22:33.560 --> 22:34.900]  I just I don't have that in me.
[22:35.120 --> 22:36.340]  You know, I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep.
[22:36.460 --> 22:39.560]  So I go into the bathroom and I just grab a towel and I wet it down.
[22:39.660 --> 22:41.340]  And in the dark, I get on my hands and knees
[22:41.340 --> 22:45.260]  and I just scrub the floor as best as I can in the dark.
[22:45.340 --> 22:47.720]  And then I get another towel and I try to dry it all up
[22:48.200 --> 22:51.140]  and get it as clean as I can, as quietly as I can.
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.840]  And then I realize I have to change my clothes.
[22:52.900 --> 22:56.260]  So I go into the bathroom and I shut the door so I can take my jammies off
[22:56.260 --> 22:59.160]  and get the sticky stuff off my arms and legs or wherever.
[22:59.320 --> 23:01.740]  Not my legs, but my arms and like wherever it hit me.
[23:01.800 --> 23:04.380]  And then go put new jammies on and then go to bed.
[23:04.460 --> 23:07.300]  So it's like I'm like 20 minutes in to getting up to take a piss
[23:07.300 --> 23:10.000]  at this point of trying not to wake them up.
[23:10.940 --> 23:17.220]  Monday night, the next night, I'm playing Warzone with the truck boys.
[23:17.620 --> 23:19.560]  About two o'clock, I come to bed.
[23:19.600 --> 23:24.240]  I get into bed, put my head on the pillow and realize I have to take a piss.
[23:24.240 --> 23:26.800]  And it's like one of those ones where it's like, could you sleep?
[23:26.860 --> 23:29.240]  I could probably sleep till six or seven a.m. and be fine.
[23:29.380 --> 23:31.460]  But I'd rather just I'd rather sleep well. Right.
[23:31.460 --> 23:32.200]  And just get it out of the way.
[23:32.220 --> 23:34.640]  So I get back up. I go into the bathroom.
[23:34.800 --> 23:35.620]  I take my piss.
[23:35.660 --> 23:38.360]  I come back to my desk to get back into my bed.
[23:38.460 --> 23:41.500]  And next to me, I see a gerbler
[23:42.320 --> 23:46.580]  full of Italian limeade soda
[23:46.580 --> 23:50.380]  that I bought myself from Central Market or Whole Foods the other day as a treat.
[23:50.420 --> 23:53.520]  I was like, I deserve something special, something better than Diet Pepsi.
[23:53.520 --> 23:56.220]  So I bought this Italian soda that's like limeade, right?
[23:56.280 --> 23:58.800]  It's the stickiest, sugariest, sweetest thing ever.
[23:59.520 --> 24:02.560]  I had brought it upstairs with me at like 11 o'clock at night
[24:02.560 --> 24:05.280]  because I knew I was going to be playing with the truck boys all night long
[24:05.280 --> 24:05.980]  and you get thirsty.
[24:06.140 --> 24:08.480]  And the last thing you want to do is go all the way back downstairs
[24:08.480 --> 24:10.180]  to your kitchen to get a drink and come back up.
[24:10.420 --> 24:12.900]  But once again, I had set it on the nightstand and forgotten about it.
[24:12.900 --> 24:14.620]  And it sat there the whole time I played trucks.
[24:14.960 --> 24:17.240]  So I go, oh, I'll just have a sip of this.
[24:17.420 --> 24:21.560]  And I go to pick it up and I and I do.
[24:21.560 --> 24:22.680]  And everything's fine.
[24:22.720 --> 24:25.060]  And I take a sip and I set it back down.
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.780]  But I guess I set it on my glasses, my reading glasses.
[24:29.040 --> 24:30.560]  And so it falls.
[24:30.600 --> 24:32.800]  But it falls the other way towards the wall.
[24:32.800 --> 24:36.260]  Oh no. And this thing is it's a Gerpler, goddammit.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.160]  It's full.
[24:37.840 --> 24:40.620]  And so also it rolls down, hits the ground.
[24:40.740 --> 24:43.260]  It goes to the dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog, dog.
[24:43.260 --> 24:46.540]  It rolls, making this large plastic bounce noise as it goes around.
[24:47.440 --> 24:49.460]  The sticky juice hits.
[24:50.080 --> 24:52.520]  Oh, well, first off, what happens is I'm frozen.
[24:52.740 --> 24:54.040]  This is my deja vu nightmare.
[24:54.040 --> 24:56.420]  I look at it and I think this has already happened.
[24:56.980 --> 24:58.460]  This is no big deal. This has already happened.
[24:58.520 --> 24:59.380]  This happened last night.
[24:59.660 --> 25:02.820]  And so I don't do anything because I'm like not fully there.
[25:02.960 --> 25:06.660]  And I just watch it kind of before I can like maybe three or four seconds
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.400]  before I realize, oh, no, this is happening again right now.
[25:08.520 --> 25:09.920]  This just happened yesterday. It's happening again.
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.280]  How is this happening to me again?
[25:11.320 --> 25:12.380]  I don't understand it. Right.
[25:12.700 --> 25:15.400]  So you were having a you thought you might have been having a flashback at first.
[25:15.460 --> 25:18.380]  Yeah, I just like that where you're not fully there
[25:18.380 --> 25:20.100]  and you just freeze in the moment.
[25:20.200 --> 25:21.120]  Yeah, this doesn't make sense.
[25:21.380 --> 25:23.420]  Like I'm not understanding what's going on in the world right now.
[25:23.480 --> 25:26.660]  Like I'm existing and I'm like unstuck in time, like in fucking
[25:27.900 --> 25:28.680]  like in that book.
[25:29.040 --> 25:32.720]  I love the idea of it being like in slow motion, bouncing all around, sloshing liquid.
[25:32.840 --> 25:35.000]  And you're just you're just like, this can't be right.
[25:35.100 --> 25:36.120]  This can't be happening again.
[25:36.220 --> 25:37.620]  Yeah, this isn't.
[25:37.720 --> 25:39.180]  I'm unstuck like in Slaughterhouse.
[25:39.480 --> 25:41.060]  Yeah. And you're like, no, this didn't this.
[25:41.140 --> 25:43.100]  I don't have to deal with this right now because this already happened yesterday.
[25:43.120 --> 25:46.060]  Right. And then I realized that, oh, God.
[25:47.020 --> 25:49.900]  And and I look over and the dog and the wife are still asleep
[25:49.900 --> 25:52.780]  and it is so much more liquid.
[25:53.020 --> 25:56.320]  And so my first thought is to go down to my knees to see how bad it is.
[25:56.440 --> 26:00.520]  So I just dropped to my knees into a puddle of liquid.
[26:00.680 --> 26:04.980]  So now my new jammies are soaked at the knees, just like completely and totally
[26:04.980 --> 26:05.640]  soaked. Right.
[26:06.060 --> 26:09.740]  So I'm like, oh, you fucking double moron.
[26:09.820 --> 26:11.320]  Like you're extra stupid.
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.540]  So I get up and I go into the bathroom and I take my fucking jammies off again.
[26:15.540 --> 26:20.060]  And then I get more towels and then I start to scrub in and I start to clean it.
[26:20.180 --> 26:23.800]  And this is somehow so much worse than the monster energy drink, this this Italian
[26:23.800 --> 26:26.980]  soda. And it's just like there's so much more of it and it's everywhere.
[26:26.980 --> 26:30.460]  And as I'm going through it in the dark, I realize it gets on.
[26:30.600 --> 26:32.500]  I wrote it all down to make sure I don't forget.
[26:32.960 --> 26:37.920]  It gets on my lamp, my laptop, my reading glasses, my phone charging
[26:37.920 --> 26:43.200]  station, my watch, my phone itself, the book I'm reading all just covered in it.
[26:43.200 --> 26:48.360]  Right. Oh, I also don't notice till the next day that even though it fell backwards,
[26:48.420 --> 26:50.620]  some of the water went forward as well, obviously.
[26:51.200 --> 26:54.480]  And the bottom drawer was slightly open on my nightstand.
[26:54.720 --> 26:59.320]  So I had a heating pad that just got covered in in soda somehow.
[26:59.780 --> 27:01.240]  So that was all sticky and ruined.
[27:01.280 --> 27:02.240]  I didn't find that out till much later.
[27:02.360 --> 27:07.920]  And so I'm on the ground under under my nightstand and my bed, like laying down to
[27:07.920 --> 27:11.360]  get because I can't get under the bed well enough, you know, on my knees, like
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.600]  literally laying on the ground naked, just rubbing the ground with a wet and a dry
[27:15.600 --> 27:18.500]  towel for maybe twenty five minutes this time.
[27:18.960 --> 27:20.940]  The whole time it doing it in the dark.
[27:20.980 --> 27:24.580]  So I don't want to wake up Emily and the dog put on new jammies, go to bed the next
[27:24.580 --> 27:28.380]  night. I go, I'm not I'm not bringing anything with me.
[27:28.800 --> 27:30.920]  I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. It's never going to happen again.
[27:31.080 --> 27:32.620]  Right. No. So I don't.
[27:32.740 --> 27:33.760]  And then everything's fine.
[27:34.200 --> 27:35.940]  Last night. No.
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.440]  Come on, Geoff.
[27:37.880 --> 27:39.900]  Last night. This is anticlimactic.
[27:39.900 --> 27:44.820]  Last night we we went to the Bill Simmons podcast live in Austin at the Paramount
[27:44.820 --> 27:47.780]  Theater. And so I didn't get a chance to eat dinner before I went.
[27:48.220 --> 27:49.640]  We didn't get home till about eleven o'clock.
[27:49.880 --> 27:51.720]  I swing by McDonald's on the way home.
[27:52.780 --> 27:54.340]  Grab just a McDonald's for us.
[27:54.840 --> 27:56.780]  We eat dinner and then we go upstairs to go to bed.
[27:57.080 --> 28:01.220]  I have a giant Diet Coke, like a large Diet Coke with the top off.
[28:01.280 --> 28:04.300]  I've been chopping on ice and I set it on my nightstand.
[28:04.400 --> 28:07.540]  And then I look at it and I go, no, no, no, no, not doing that.
[28:07.540 --> 28:11.300]  So I pick it up and I put it in the kit in the bathroom next to the sink.
[28:11.560 --> 28:12.620]  And then I go about my business.
[28:12.620 --> 28:16.460]  And then later, like an hour later or maybe a half hour later, I go back into the
[28:16.460 --> 28:17.840]  bedroom and it's on the nightstand again.
[28:17.920 --> 28:20.260]  And I realized at some point I picked it up and put it back on the nightstand.
[28:20.300 --> 28:23.680]  And I went, nope, not you're not kicking yourself that that this time, dumbass.
[28:23.800 --> 28:26.300]  So I'd make an effort to go and put it back in the bathroom.
[28:26.300 --> 28:30.960]  Right. Then I decide not to play trucks with the truck boy or called it with the
[28:30.960 --> 28:33.140]  truck boys last night and just to go to bed early.
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.560]  So I go to bed at like it's like eleven thirty by the time we go to bed, you know,
[28:36.560 --> 28:39.880]  and maybe midnight and about two a.m.
[28:39.900 --> 28:43.220]  I have to pee. So I get up in the middle of night and I go to the bathroom and I pee
[28:43.220 --> 28:46.660]  and I'm coming back to the bathroom and I see the Diet Coke on the counter.
[28:49.480 --> 28:53.860]  I'm safe and I go to pick it up to have a victory sip because I'm so smart.
[28:53.940 --> 28:57.260]  And I just punch it. I just punch it as hard as I can.
[28:57.360 --> 29:00.720]  I don't even know how. And it just goes straight to the sink.
[29:00.900 --> 29:02.760]  It just goes straight into the fucking sink.
[29:02.820 --> 29:06.160]  There's no mess. But I pour an entire Diet Coke and all.
[29:06.160 --> 29:07.820]  There's still some ice in it. Not a lot.
[29:08.980 --> 29:12.640]  Into the sink. And I just lose the entire thing and I just can't believe it.
[29:12.700 --> 29:14.720]  And so I go to bed. But I don't know what to do now.
[29:14.780 --> 29:19.040]  I'm scared to go to bed tonight because it's three out of the last four nights.
[29:19.180 --> 29:23.320]  I've spilled major amounts of liquid in the process of getting up to go to the
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.840]  bathroom. I'm terrified. I don't know how I'm stuck in this cycle.
[29:28.060 --> 29:32.060]  I don't know how to get out of it. I was conscious of it last night when I
[29:32.060 --> 29:35.880]  literally, I'm looking at my hand and I'm like, I'm going to have this.
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.400]  This Diet Coke is going to taste so fucking sweet at 2.15 in the morning because
[29:39.400 --> 29:41.660]  I'm not going to be cleaning it up three minutes from now.
[29:42.180 --> 29:45.560]  And then I still managed to just like fucking like karate chop it.
[29:46.080 --> 29:47.580]  I don't know what's wrong with me.
[29:48.200 --> 29:50.980]  Were you getting flashbacks to Purple Nightmare while you were cleaning up?
[29:51.100 --> 29:54.720]  Didn't think about it at all. I wasn't thinking about anything other than misery.
[29:55.180 --> 29:57.580]  When you're on the ground at three in the morning,
[29:57.580 --> 30:03.440]  rolling around in dog hair and, you know, fucking dust bunnies under your bed.
[30:03.480 --> 30:05.960]  And you're just trying to clean up sticky liquid.
[30:06.100 --> 30:07.400]  You're not thinking about Purple Nightmare.
[30:07.620 --> 30:10.120]  I didn't have that, but I didn't have that many mental faculties going.
[30:10.580 --> 30:11.760]  Why don't you just bring water to bed?
[30:12.440 --> 30:13.880]  It's still, I mean, he'd still spill.
[30:14.520 --> 30:15.520]  It's easier to clean.
[30:16.220 --> 30:17.060]  It does matter, dude.
[30:17.120 --> 30:21.420]  It matters if it gets into the walls, if it gets into the door, like it seeps under the floor.
[30:21.640 --> 30:22.580]  Like it still matters.
[30:23.060 --> 30:24.580]  It still gets into the electric equipment.
[30:24.580 --> 30:28.340]  You need a sippy cup lid for your Gerpler.
[30:28.760 --> 30:32.840]  I was actually thinking this is the perfect opportunity to invent something.
[30:33.280 --> 30:34.280]  Gerpler silences.
[30:34.680 --> 30:36.220]  Like imagine a little rubber gasket.
[30:36.520 --> 30:37.320]  Yep, yep, yep.
[30:37.360 --> 30:41.480]  One that is the perfect dimensions to push into the bottom of the Gerpler
[30:41.480 --> 30:46.560]  and then a rubber o-ring around the rim with just like a little mouth size cutout.
[30:46.900 --> 30:49.460]  And that way, if you drop the Gerpler, completely quiet.
[30:49.700 --> 30:52.260]  What you're saying, what you're describing is a Gerpler.
[30:53.640 --> 30:56.440]  We need to invent a Gerpler.
[30:56.660 --> 30:58.100]  Yeah, but also one for the bottom.
[30:58.280 --> 31:03.400]  I would love a Gerpler because I have a problem with my desk where I have wires everywhere,
[31:03.740 --> 31:05.460]  just crossing and whatnot.
[31:05.760 --> 31:10.240]  And I will fill up my Gerpler at the middle of the night and then try to put on my desk
[31:10.240 --> 31:12.700]  and not be able to see because I'm in the dark.
[31:12.740 --> 31:17.780]  But just know it's wire, wire, wire and being so scared of dumping that full
[31:17.780 --> 31:21.200]  giant cup of liquid all over all of my tech stuff.
[31:21.200 --> 31:22.660]  What's in your night, Gerpler?
[31:23.240 --> 31:24.600]  What do you mean? Well, it's just water.
[31:25.040 --> 31:27.640]  OK. Yeah, I'm just like, I'll fill it up in the bathroom,
[31:28.160 --> 31:32.220]  go to sit down at my desk, and then I won't be able to see very well.
[31:32.340 --> 31:36.520]  And is the thing of like, I got to really feel out where this cup is.
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.340]  I do not trust it.
[31:38.380 --> 31:40.380]  But a Gerpler, that would change.
[31:40.480 --> 31:41.560]  That is a game changer.
[31:42.200 --> 31:44.180]  So you get water from your bathroom tap?
[31:44.640 --> 31:46.740]  Yeah. Why don't you just drink out of the tap?
[31:47.680 --> 31:49.320]  What? What?
[31:49.720 --> 31:53.220]  Well, do you come back and like finish a whole Gerpler of water?
[31:53.300 --> 31:54.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[31:54.940 --> 31:56.420]  How do you not get up in the night to piss?
[31:56.840 --> 31:58.280]  I piss all the time at night.
[31:58.560 --> 31:59.740]  Oh, you just don't care.
[32:00.240 --> 32:02.340]  I just I drink. I need to drink.
[32:02.460 --> 32:04.000]  I like I like drinking. I like drink.
[32:04.060 --> 32:08.040]  I like having like something to sip on, whether it's water, mainly water.
[32:08.680 --> 32:10.720]  I'm a drinks guy. Big drinks guy.
[32:12.160 --> 32:14.540]  For the record, I'm not opposed to water at night.
[32:14.620 --> 32:15.440]  It just wasn't. No.
[32:15.760 --> 32:17.180]  I wasn't planning on most of those.
[32:17.240 --> 32:19.200]  It's just what happened to be around me in the moment.
[32:19.200 --> 32:22.300]  You know, I just don't think I I don't think you should be allowed
[32:22.300 --> 32:23.760]  to have drinks at night anymore, Geoff.
[32:23.860 --> 32:24.740]  Like, I think you might be done.
[32:24.820 --> 32:25.780]  I think this just might be it, dude.
[32:26.260 --> 32:29.840]  I mean, the only night that I had peace was the night
[32:29.840 --> 32:32.120]  that I banned myself from taking a drink upstairs.
[32:32.240 --> 32:33.100]  So you might be right.
[32:33.440 --> 32:37.060]  I just I don't want to be of an age where I can't trust myself
[32:37.060 --> 32:41.820]  to pick up and drink of liquid past a certain time.
[32:42.100 --> 32:44.840]  Yeah, you might. It's hey, man, you might be there now.
[32:45.480 --> 32:46.340]  This might be it.
[32:47.140 --> 32:48.880]  You're everything you're describing.
[32:49.120 --> 32:50.560]  This might be a right now thing, dude.
[32:51.200 --> 32:53.200]  I think you need to put yourself in training.
[32:53.900 --> 32:55.500]  I think you need to work up to this.
[32:55.600 --> 32:58.380]  You gotta relearn how to drink properly in the dark.
[32:58.500 --> 33:00.380]  You are coming at me with some aggression.
[33:00.860 --> 33:02.660]  It's better than what you're doing now.
[33:03.040 --> 33:04.260]  Yeah, that's exactly.
[33:04.540 --> 33:07.740]  I'm not I don't want this for you, but based on what you've described,
[33:07.840 --> 33:13.060]  I think what you need to do is start by drinking in the shower at night.
[33:13.220 --> 33:14.000]  Yeah, I agree.
[33:14.000 --> 33:16.100]  I think if you want to drink, you have to go in the shower.
[33:16.300 --> 33:19.060]  Yeah, if it spills on you, you can just shower off.
[33:19.380 --> 33:20.200]  You'll be fine.
[33:20.540 --> 33:21.940]  It's already in the bathroom.
[33:22.380 --> 33:24.000]  Yeah, you have to keep all your drinks in the shower.
[33:24.320 --> 33:25.640]  I think you start with the shower.
[33:25.980 --> 33:27.740]  I just think you need a nice long straw.
[33:28.380 --> 33:31.380]  Big, heavy cup and a long straw that goes to your mouth while you sleep.
[33:31.640 --> 33:33.040]  He's going to miss. It's not.
[33:33.180 --> 33:33.660]  No way.
[33:34.040 --> 33:35.080]  I got to be honest here, Gav.
[33:35.100 --> 33:38.160]  I think that I think I'm I think I like their idea more.
[33:38.660 --> 33:41.400]  Maybe I should only be able to drink in the shower because then there's
[33:41.400 --> 33:42.680]  like an intention behind it.
[33:42.680 --> 33:45.860]  I'll it'll like because you're like half asleep, right?
[33:46.200 --> 33:49.820]  But if I'm if I'm I have enough mental faculties to realize
[33:49.820 --> 33:52.020]  that I need to go into the special drink room,
[33:52.080 --> 33:55.000]  I'll be alert enough to probably drink fine in the drink room.
[33:55.060 --> 33:55.860]  And if I'm not, you're right.
[33:55.900 --> 33:58.500]  I can clean it up in that room right there immediately.
[33:59.120 --> 34:01.580]  And it's further away from Emily and the dog.
[34:01.620 --> 34:04.000]  And even if I spill it, it'll be loud as all hell
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.040]  if I drop a cup in that shower on that tile.
[34:06.100 --> 34:08.340]  But at least the cleanup will be faster.
[34:08.700 --> 34:09.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[34:09.340 --> 34:11.900]  You can let the dog in the shower with you while you drink if that helps you.
[34:11.900 --> 34:13.280]  No, he needs to be asleep.
[34:13.320 --> 34:14.340]  OK, just making sure.
[34:15.800 --> 34:18.120]  So, Andrew, as someone who drinks your bathroom water,
[34:18.380 --> 34:19.460]  do you ever drink the shower?
[34:20.280 --> 34:21.820]  What? No. OK.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.380]  Oh, and sometimes I mean, water gets in the mouth.
[34:25.160 --> 34:26.320]  Whatever happens, happens.
[34:26.620 --> 34:28.740]  But I'm not like mouth open.
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.460]  I got to refresh in the shower.
[34:31.940 --> 34:32.200]  Why not?
[34:33.220 --> 34:36.720]  Uh, that's a yeah, so it's going on.
[34:37.340 --> 34:38.900]  Yeah, you got hot water.
[34:39.080 --> 34:40.520]  I'm not a hot water guy.
[34:41.060 --> 34:43.840]  There are a few layers as to why I wouldn't.
[34:43.900 --> 34:47.540]  But if water ends up in my mouth and I mean, I feel like I
[34:47.540 --> 34:50.600]  for the most part spit it out, but I'm sure I've accidentally swallowed some.
[34:50.960 --> 34:52.640]  But you would never just be like, OK, I'm done with the shower.
[34:52.740 --> 34:55.020]  And let me turn this to cold and just have a drink.
[34:55.280 --> 34:58.080]  No, because this is not really a convenient way to do it.
[34:58.960 --> 35:01.680]  It's like a shotgun blast to your face of water.
[35:01.820 --> 35:03.540]  Like, I don't it's the spread.
[35:04.780 --> 35:05.640]  It would go everywhere.
[35:06.080 --> 35:09.160]  And then I'd have to redraw my like, it's just a lot everywhere.
[35:09.160 --> 35:10.440]  You're already soaking wet, though.
[35:10.820 --> 35:12.100]  OK, I'm still wet.
[35:12.200 --> 35:14.220]  And I've just decided I just had the shower.
[35:14.300 --> 35:16.440]  OK, instead of turning off the shower, you turn off the hot.
[35:16.720 --> 35:18.200]  It's cold now. Have a little drink.
[35:18.280 --> 35:21.080]  I think the problem is I don't want any other part of my body
[35:21.080 --> 35:23.820]  to be as cold as the inside of my mouth when drinking.
[35:24.440 --> 35:26.040]  But your lips and cheeks and stuff.
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.940]  Yeah, my face, I'm going to blast myself with cold water.
[35:29.200 --> 35:33.460]  Like even if I get 80 percent, that 20 percent is really not enjoyable.
[35:33.800 --> 35:35.660]  It's not the most efficient way to do it either.
[35:35.880 --> 35:37.660]  No. What if you had a shower funnel?
[35:38.040 --> 35:39.220]  You turn it to cold.
[35:39.640 --> 35:42.340]  You look up. It's all going in the funnel and it funnels into your mouth.
[35:42.760 --> 35:43.620]  That's a good idea.
[35:44.120 --> 35:47.660]  I mean, what you're describing would work, but you're like creating a device
[35:47.660 --> 35:48.720]  that I didn't ask for.
[35:49.160 --> 35:50.280]  You're never thirsty in the shower?
[35:50.780 --> 35:51.800]  No. OK.
[35:52.220 --> 35:53.080]  I don't think I've ever been.
[35:53.220 --> 35:55.060]  That's a you know what? That's deep, Gavin.
[35:55.360 --> 35:56.860]  I don't think I've ever been thirsty in the shower.
[35:58.320 --> 36:01.120]  I don't think I've ever even considered being thirsty in the shower.
[36:01.380 --> 36:04.360]  I've been thirsty in the tub plenty of times.
[36:04.800 --> 36:05.600]  Really? That's a nightmare.
[36:05.960 --> 36:07.140]  Well, you got a cold tap right there.
[36:07.600 --> 36:10.880]  Yeah, but it's it's all the way on the other side of the I'd have to.
[36:11.160 --> 36:12.000]  It's a lot of work.
[36:12.240 --> 36:16.560]  Do you think it do you think if I only drink my nighttime drinks
[36:16.560 --> 36:20.960]  in the shower for spillage reasons that I will become conditioned
[36:20.960 --> 36:23.480]  to be thirsty in the shower or get thirsty in the shower?
[36:24.160 --> 36:24.180]  That's interesting.
[36:25.120 --> 36:26.520]  That's I don't know.
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.520]  I don't think you'll do it long enough.
[36:28.600 --> 36:32.380]  I think like you need to trust yourself after like three consecutive
[36:32.380 --> 36:35.860]  successful shower drinks to then move into the bathroom.
[36:35.860 --> 36:38.760]  That seems pretty low, given my track record.
[36:38.860 --> 36:40.160]  But I appreciate your.
[36:40.380 --> 36:42.260]  But you have a lifetime of not doing it.
[36:42.300 --> 36:45.420]  So I feel like, yeah, comparing.
[36:46.980 --> 36:48.100]  On an average.
[36:48.600 --> 36:49.820]  I guess that's true.
[36:50.160 --> 36:52.020]  I have a bit of a recency bias, though.
[36:52.160 --> 36:53.720]  You do. It's bad.
[36:53.920 --> 36:58.160]  What I the part of this story that I really enjoy that we haven't gone over yet
[36:58.160 --> 37:01.140]  is it from Emily's perspective,
[37:01.680 --> 37:04.380]  because I'm sure all of this happened
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.080]  and then the next day you were like, you are not going to believe
[37:08.080 --> 37:09.060]  what happened last night.
[37:09.180 --> 37:11.840]  I spilled. It was a disaster.
[37:11.980 --> 37:13.140]  I had to clean it up.
[37:13.320 --> 37:15.060]  I was trying to make sure you didn't wake up.
[37:15.120 --> 37:19.120]  It was a whole thing to do that multiple nights in a row to Emily.
[37:19.820 --> 37:24.020]  I would have loved to have seen her face to learn that this happened
[37:24.860 --> 37:25.580]  consecutive times.
[37:25.820 --> 37:26.960]  Here's how that conversation went.
[37:28.860 --> 37:31.920]  The first time I did it, I said that to her and she said, Oh, I heard.
[37:32.460 --> 37:36.980]  And the second time I did it, I did it the second time I did it.
[37:37.120 --> 37:38.500]  I didn't mention it to her at all.
[37:38.580 --> 37:40.700]  And she said, same problem again last night, huh?
[37:40.740 --> 37:42.940]  Oh, that's so bad.
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.440]  And then the third last night, last night with the with the
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.060]  punch in the soda into the bathroom, I don't think she had any idea.
[37:50.260 --> 37:52.760]  That was Emily. Emily rules.
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.020]  That's so funny.
[37:55.780 --> 37:58.640]  Oh, hey, more drinking problems, not dipshit.
[37:59.700 --> 38:01.360]  Yeah, that's kind of the energy of it.
[38:02.760 --> 38:05.140]  Oh, what if we cut a drink holder into your nightstand?
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.400]  That's not a bad idea.
[38:06.460 --> 38:07.120]  I like that.
[38:07.740 --> 38:09.060]  Gavin, you're back on top.
[38:09.420 --> 38:10.160]  I like that idea.
[38:10.160 --> 38:11.420]  I like the GERPLID.
[38:11.780 --> 38:13.460]  Maybe I really like the GERPLID.
[38:13.760 --> 38:16.600]  Instead of cutting a hole into my nightstand,
[38:16.680 --> 38:20.040]  maybe it's like a clip on cup holder that we can put in.
[38:20.040 --> 38:21.360]  I don't trust that for you, honestly.
[38:21.660 --> 38:23.280]  But we can we you know, you keep spitballing.
[38:23.400 --> 38:24.860]  I'm just I'm worried about you mostly.
[38:25.240 --> 38:26.280]  No, I understand. I understand.
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.840]  Oh, have you seen one of those really heavy mugs?
[38:29.400 --> 38:32.780]  Yeah, we should get you a near unmovable mug.
[38:33.120 --> 38:36.140]  Yeah. And that way, there's no way you can knock it over.
[38:36.260 --> 38:39.920]  You're sort of like a mug meoler, if you will.
[38:40.040 --> 38:42.780]  Yeah, I have found a twenty two pound mug.
[38:43.080 --> 38:44.360]  Yeah, let's get him a Mjölnir.
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.220]  Yeah, I would consider that.
[38:47.340 --> 38:48.520]  That's an interesting idea, too.
[38:48.620 --> 38:49.220]  Well, the prop.
[38:49.300 --> 38:53.400]  But here's the issue, though, is he's bringing liquids there, right?
[38:53.400 --> 38:57.880]  Like you'd have to fill this thing with the intent of drinking it there.
[38:57.880 --> 39:00.140]  And that hasn't been the case with these spills.
[39:00.700 --> 39:01.840]  It's true. It's true.
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.040]  I'll just have to be a little more intentional about how I do this.
[39:04.440 --> 39:08.600]  But I think that so much of what he's doing is knocking over
[39:09.880 --> 39:14.080]  this thing that if we got him a Mjölnir again,
[39:15.660 --> 39:18.360]  that he's way less likely to knock it over.
[39:18.920 --> 39:20.480]  Totally. I absolutely agree with that.
[39:20.660 --> 39:24.820]  My point was just that he keeps accidentally leaving liquid in these places.
[39:24.820 --> 39:30.260]  And for him to use this, you'd have to intentionally put liquid in that spot.
[39:30.400 --> 39:32.240]  So he'd have to just change his thinking.
[39:32.640 --> 39:34.720]  I have to show you guys this.
[39:34.920 --> 39:37.200]  Please. You know who the real loser in this whole thing is?
[39:37.240 --> 39:39.440]  I just feel so bad for and about you.
[39:40.000 --> 39:40.940]  No, it's not me.
[39:41.100 --> 39:44.360]  I mean, I'm always going to be the loser in my story, right?
[39:44.420 --> 39:48.540]  I'm the I'm the I'm the lose tag in this of all my my stories.
[39:48.800 --> 39:50.220]  But it's Emily.
[39:50.620 --> 39:54.580]  I've clearly yeah, I've clearly begun my decline.
[39:55.320 --> 39:58.340]  I'm obviously on the back nine, whether I want to be or not.
[39:58.420 --> 39:59.920]  And she's stuck with it.
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.080]  You know, like she got like one or two good years with me when we met.
[40:04.140 --> 40:07.060]  And then it's just a fucking steady race downhill.
[40:07.700 --> 40:07.920]  Yeah.
[40:08.800 --> 40:13.000]  So I found heavy mug, the world's heaviest mug.
[40:13.240 --> 40:15.240]  It's one hundred and fifty five dollars.
[40:15.320 --> 40:16.560]  We save sixty five dollars.
[40:17.140 --> 40:20.360]  The image that they show is so funny.
[40:20.440 --> 40:22.040]  The first image. OK, cool.
[40:22.120 --> 40:24.200]  Backlit. Neat. It says heavy with an asterisk.
[40:24.200 --> 40:26.960]  It also kind of a regulation logo or not quite.
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.260]  It's more of a red hot chili peppers thing, but it's fine.
[40:29.720 --> 40:31.220]  The other one, it's on a motorcycle.
[40:31.260 --> 40:35.740]  Cool. The third picture, the one that I sent you guys, it's filled with bullets.
[40:36.940 --> 40:38.240]  You guys put bullets.
[40:38.440 --> 40:39.520]  Is that a U.S. thing?
[40:39.940 --> 40:41.720]  It's a it's Texas thing.
[40:41.900 --> 40:43.060]  Yeah, everybody has a bullet mug.
[40:43.120 --> 40:45.340]  I've never thought about it, but yeah.
[40:45.560 --> 40:48.760]  And also, oh my God, dude, 22 pound dude.
[40:49.260 --> 40:51.820]  Geoff, we got to get this heavy, heavy mug for you.
[40:51.820 --> 40:55.740]  Yeah, I'm if you guys will, if you guys buy me that mug, I'll try to use it.
[40:55.740 --> 40:57.440]  Justin is Yosemite Sam era.
[40:58.320 --> 40:59.700]  He's filling it with ammo.
[41:00.300 --> 41:01.160]  It's pretty cool.
[41:01.820 --> 41:03.560]  If you knock this one over, you'll break your toes.
[41:03.700 --> 41:04.700]  Is it bulletproof?
[41:04.880 --> 41:07.580]  Yeah. Is there anything that's like it's bulletproof?
[41:07.780 --> 41:08.540]  I don't know.
[41:08.720 --> 41:12.780]  There's a little video there where a guy puts it through a glass table
[41:12.780 --> 41:13.620]  because it's so heavy.
[41:13.760 --> 41:16.900]  And then there's also another one where they're cheersing one with a glass
[41:16.900 --> 41:21.340]  glass mug and one with the heavy mug and the heavy mug explodes the glass mug.
[41:21.340 --> 41:23.080]  What's your nightstand made of, Geoff?
[41:23.820 --> 41:26.220]  Wood. OK, I think we're all right.
[41:26.380 --> 41:26.880]  I think we're all right.
[41:27.000 --> 41:28.580]  I think it's a pretty solid nightstand.
[41:28.660 --> 41:31.060]  I think I'm OK. Dude, can I tell you something concerning?
[41:31.300 --> 41:34.760]  I just looked down at my table and there was a little bit of blood on it.
[41:34.840 --> 41:36.280]  And I don't know where that blood came from.
[41:36.440 --> 41:38.580]  What? That's mystery blood.
[41:39.180 --> 41:41.240]  Are you all right?
[41:41.320 --> 41:42.720]  Like, where's the blood coming from?
[41:42.860 --> 41:46.000]  I don't know. But no, I mean, like, touch yourself and see.
[41:46.100 --> 41:48.340]  Yeah, I'm looking. No, I'm looking.
[41:48.340 --> 41:51.360]  I don't know where I'm bleeding from.
[41:51.500 --> 41:52.540]  It would be your leg.
[41:53.160 --> 41:54.760]  Your leg. Wait, what do you talk?
[41:54.880 --> 41:56.100]  Wait, where is the blood?
[41:56.740 --> 41:58.260]  It's on. It's next to my keyboard.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.480]  Here, I'm going to be from his leg.
[42:00.660 --> 42:03.580]  I thought this is I thought he was looking at his nightstand.
[42:05.180 --> 42:07.400]  Why would he be looking at his nightstand in the middle of a podcast?
[42:07.520 --> 42:09.260]  He's in his he's in the office.
[42:10.140 --> 42:12.340]  You know what? Yeah, but I record in my bedroom.
[42:12.480 --> 42:14.300]  So I just put everybody in my mind table.
[42:14.460 --> 42:15.760]  We're all in our bedrooms right now.
[42:15.760 --> 42:17.820]  So really, the mind table is my bedroom.
[42:17.820 --> 42:20.160]  That is a lot of blood.
[42:20.300 --> 42:21.040]  That's a concern.
[42:21.160 --> 42:24.460]  OK, Geoff, it's not just a concerning amount of blood.
[42:24.660 --> 42:27.660]  It's also that it's smeared around everywhere.
[42:27.860 --> 42:29.400]  Yeah. Hold on. I'm wiping it off.
[42:29.600 --> 42:31.160]  Yeah. I don't know where that came from.
[42:31.400 --> 42:33.120]  Is it are your hands bleeding?
[42:33.360 --> 42:34.340]  I have. I'm looking.
[42:34.500 --> 42:36.540]  I cut my elbow like two weeks ago.
[42:36.740 --> 42:37.900]  But I'm looking at you also.
[42:38.160 --> 42:40.020]  You also cut your finger with a knife in the middle of.
[42:40.200 --> 42:41.360]  That's not it. That's yeah.
[42:41.700 --> 42:42.480]  That was a long time ago.
[42:42.720 --> 42:44.140]  It's not my elbow cut.
[42:44.180 --> 42:45.660]  Are you knife juggling right now?
[42:46.220 --> 42:47.400]  I don't even have a knife in front.
[42:47.920 --> 42:49.740]  OK. I don't have a knife in front of me.
[42:50.420 --> 42:50.820]  Yeah, I don't know.
[42:50.900 --> 42:51.640]  I don't know where that came from.
[42:51.780 --> 42:54.540]  You know, I bet you if you had a big mug of bullets on your desk,
[42:54.580 --> 42:55.780]  that bleeding wouldn't have happened.
[42:56.540 --> 42:58.640]  Whatever happened would be scared to mess with you.
[42:58.860 --> 42:59.380]  That's true.
[43:00.480 --> 43:01.520]  It's a big old mug.
[43:03.060 --> 43:04.140]  You are you're a bleeder.
[43:06.060 --> 43:07.540]  I am a bleeder. Thanks.
[43:07.620 --> 43:10.400]  Yeah, I am. I over index on blood.
[43:11.220 --> 43:14.260]  Yeah. You probably the bloodiest friend I have.
[43:14.340 --> 43:15.760]  I'm ready to pop at all times.
[43:18.160 --> 43:20.140]  Oh, I wish it was easier to test blood.
[43:20.640 --> 43:21.620]  What do you mean?
[43:21.660 --> 43:23.600]  Like, you know, like crime shows.
[43:23.900 --> 43:25.180]  Waka, waka, waka.
[43:25.900 --> 43:27.680]  Oh, come on. That's joke of the day, right?
[43:27.700 --> 43:29.720]  I know that's not for our audience, but that was pretty good.
[43:29.820 --> 43:31.820]  I thought that was a good one. Topical, man. Topical.
[43:32.200 --> 43:32.820]  Thank you. Thank you.
[43:33.820 --> 43:34.800]  Oh, she the blood lady?
[43:35.440 --> 43:36.980]  Yeah, she's she's in prison, though.
[43:37.060 --> 43:38.860]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's the blood lady.
[43:39.300 --> 43:41.300]  What do you want to test blood for, Andrew?
[43:41.720 --> 43:45.620]  I just when you come across blood, sometimes it's like, I wonder where that came from.
[43:45.620 --> 43:46.840]  I wonder if it's even mine.
[43:47.740 --> 43:48.520]  Whose blood is this?
[43:49.080 --> 43:51.980]  How often are you finding random blood that could not often.
[43:52.140 --> 43:55.160]  But whenever I do, I go, huh, where did that come from?
[43:55.920 --> 43:59.720]  And like Geoff saying, it's not like he doesn't seem to know if it's his.
[43:59.980 --> 44:02.700]  It'd be it'd just be cool to be able to test it and go, oh, this is my blood.
[44:03.040 --> 44:05.760]  I mean, it's got to be mine because I'm the only one that sits at this.
[44:05.800 --> 44:07.220]  Yeah, that's that's what I was going to say.
[44:07.320 --> 44:08.520]  Ever in this room.
[44:08.640 --> 44:09.960]  You would assume so.
[44:10.360 --> 44:13.400]  But you would know definitively if you could test it.
[44:13.780 --> 44:14.240]  It's true.
[44:14.800 --> 44:17.720]  I feel like blood that I've been surprised by, I always know is mine.
[44:17.960 --> 44:20.140]  I mean, it wasn't blood there when I sat down today.
[44:20.580 --> 44:24.340]  See, you assume it's yours because that's the rational thing to assume.
[44:24.820 --> 44:25.920]  But what if it's not?
[44:26.600 --> 44:28.420]  Whose blood could it be? I don't know.
[44:28.900 --> 44:31.720]  I feel like whenever I found blood, it's guaranteed mine.
[44:33.140 --> 44:36.820]  It would be weird if you were like had some sort of a blood leaving fetish
[44:36.820 --> 44:39.600]  where you would just like break into homes and then just like bleed a little bit
[44:39.600 --> 44:41.440]  and then leave the DNA band.
[44:41.440 --> 44:43.300]  I don't like that. Yeah, I don't like that either.
[44:43.300 --> 44:45.000]  They'd catch you so fast.
[44:45.320 --> 44:48.600]  You say the DNA bandit, but you're leaving your blood behind, which bandits?
[44:49.060 --> 44:50.840]  It's the it's the opposite, right?
[44:51.200 --> 44:52.380]  They steal typically.
[44:52.640 --> 44:55.560]  Yeah, I feel like the DNA bandit might take blood from people.
[44:55.680 --> 44:58.760]  But yeah, that's a but then that's a vampire and he's getting into murky
[44:58.760 --> 44:59.500]  territory here.
[44:59.640 --> 45:02.200]  Yeah, but the wet bandits used to flood the house they robbed.
[45:03.820 --> 45:06.000]  What does that have to do with what you're saying?
[45:06.280 --> 45:06.920]  No, no, you're right.
[45:07.200 --> 45:08.360]  Yeah, you're right. You're right.
[45:08.740 --> 45:11.800]  Yeah. And if this continues the argument, I'm on Gavin's side.
[45:15.480 --> 45:18.580]  But was that really a plot point of that, that they would flood the house?
[45:18.720 --> 45:19.180]  The wet bandits?
[45:20.080 --> 45:21.520]  Yeah, that was like their whole name.
[45:21.640 --> 45:22.520]  That was like the thing, right?
[45:22.540 --> 45:23.280]  The wet bandits.
[45:23.540 --> 45:24.880]  I just I don't remember that.
[45:25.780 --> 45:26.860]  Why were they called the wet bandits?
[45:27.100 --> 45:27.660]  No idea.
[45:28.240 --> 45:30.420]  I just don't remember it.
[45:30.580 --> 45:31.180]  Wet bandits.
[45:32.360 --> 45:35.000]  It was a major subplot of the film.
[45:35.340 --> 45:38.600]  I mainly watched Home Alone when I was like six or five.
[45:38.660 --> 45:39.020]  I don't know.
[45:39.440 --> 45:39.940]  Didn't stick.
[45:40.480 --> 45:42.800]  That was not a detail that was important to me, I guess.
[45:44.060 --> 45:44.700]  Mm hmm.
[45:45.180 --> 45:46.960]  Terrified of mobster stuff.
[45:47.100 --> 45:48.980]  When was the last time you saw Home Alone?
[45:49.460 --> 45:53.100]  In its entirety, probably like 20 plus years ago.
[45:53.440 --> 45:55.240]  Oh, you got to watch it at Christmas, son.
[45:55.320 --> 45:58.880]  Dude, I see that movie three times a year, probably still to this day.
[45:59.480 --> 46:00.580]  I would love to watch it with you.
[46:00.660 --> 46:01.660]  Clips of it a lot.
[46:01.740 --> 46:02.780]  Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun to watch.
[46:03.300 --> 46:03.980]  Great group watch.
[46:04.540 --> 46:06.900]  But it's one of those things where I get clips every once in a while.
[46:06.980 --> 46:10.180]  I'll go, I want to see some Home Alone and I'll watch some stuff
[46:10.180 --> 46:11.740]  and that'll kind of fill the need.
[46:11.740 --> 46:13.460]  I haven't like sat down and done a full watch.
[46:13.740 --> 46:15.740]  Maybe this summer we could have Christmas in July
[46:15.740 --> 46:17.500]  and we could sit down and watch Home Alone together.
[46:17.640 --> 46:18.460]  I love that.
[46:18.660 --> 46:19.520]  On the hottest day of the year.
[46:19.700 --> 46:22.920]  I mean, we we could release the GTA
[46:23.440 --> 46:27.640]  snowman videos we made in December and then do a Home Alone watch along.
[46:28.100 --> 46:31.540]  Can we hold the GTA snowman videos till July and have Christmas in July?
[46:31.580 --> 46:34.420]  I would love to do a watch along and do some other Christmas related content.
[46:34.460 --> 46:36.180]  It'd be like forcing the whole audience to be Australian.
[46:36.900 --> 46:37.640]  That's great.
[46:40.240 --> 46:40.960]  Not bad.
[46:41.400 --> 46:42.200]  It's not bad.
[46:42.540 --> 46:43.060]  I like it.
[46:43.140 --> 46:45.060]  Eric was not on board and you just got him on Gavin.
[46:45.160 --> 46:46.040]  You know, I was good.
[46:46.160 --> 46:48.660]  Well, because I we keep getting hit for it.
[46:48.740 --> 46:52.060]  But shit, man, we just put out a video.
[46:52.220 --> 46:56.120]  We just put out GTA Deadline and somebody is like, I think this was recorded in June.
[46:56.240 --> 46:57.060]  And it's like, all right.
[46:57.060 --> 47:00.640]  I mean, we can hold on to Christmas videos until July if that's the case.
[47:00.640 --> 47:01.400]  So let's do it.
[47:01.420 --> 47:02.780]  People complaining about
[47:03.660 --> 47:04.900]  things being not timely.
[47:05.380 --> 47:07.960]  We're serving them timely in March.
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.400]  Things are getting crazy.
[47:10.400 --> 47:12.200]  The most timely videos.
[47:12.620 --> 47:14.500]  We're serving them timely in March.
[47:14.620 --> 47:15.980]  Mario Party March.
[47:16.760 --> 47:19.360]  Oh, I just said I thought you were talking about right.
[47:19.440 --> 47:20.580]  I didn't understand. Sorry, Andrew.
[47:20.700 --> 47:21.900]  I thought that was an excellent segue.
[47:22.180 --> 47:25.360]  30 days of consecutive Mario Party,
[47:25.540 --> 47:28.020]  and we're releasing it essentially as we film it.
[47:28.800 --> 47:29.660]  Couldn't be more timely.
[47:30.220 --> 47:32.260]  Could not could not be more difficult to do.
[47:32.500 --> 47:33.540]  Yes, it's going to be.
[47:33.680 --> 47:34.280]  It's so.
[47:35.080 --> 47:37.460]  So we learned just to explain the idea fully
[47:37.460 --> 47:41.580]  that you can exit a game of Mario Party, save and then come back to that.
[47:41.880 --> 47:46.500]  And I pitched the idea of doing one turn at a time of the longest amount,
[47:46.600 --> 47:49.020]  the most amount of turns you can have in a game, which is 30.
[47:49.560 --> 47:53.600]  So for 30 consecutive days, we are all going to group up in the morning,
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.040]  play one turn of Mario Party, then save and quit and have to wait
[47:58.040 --> 48:00.220]  until the next day to continue the game.
[48:00.340 --> 48:03.340]  And we will be posting these daily as we do it.
[48:04.300 --> 48:05.340]  One day after.
[48:05.800 --> 48:06.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[48:06.240 --> 48:07.580]  So this will be on Patreon.
[48:08.080 --> 48:09.740]  So check the Patreon, subscribe.
[48:10.040 --> 48:11.080]  This is where you'll be able to watch it.
[48:11.160 --> 48:12.180]  And it's this is.
[48:13.200 --> 48:15.260]  I still this is still insane.
[48:15.720 --> 48:16.940]  Like this is still crazy.
[48:17.040 --> 48:19.780]  We'll also put out the full video at the end. Yes.
[48:20.360 --> 48:23.460]  So is it free on Patreon or is it for members only?
[48:23.580 --> 48:24.200]  That's up to you guys.
[48:24.840 --> 48:26.160]  Yeah, I don't know. We never talked about that.
[48:26.220 --> 48:27.060]  I think it could be free.
[48:27.200 --> 48:29.120]  The only reason I don't want to put on YouTube is that it.
[48:29.200 --> 48:30.700]  Yeah. Might murder the channel.
[48:30.880 --> 48:34.620]  It's going to absolutely murder the channel by putting up a 36 hour
[48:35.560 --> 48:36.880]  compilation of content.
[48:37.160 --> 48:41.240]  Also, we just had so much fun doing the advent calendar
[48:41.240 --> 48:45.380]  and we wanted to kind of have have that kind of fun again in some daily way.
[48:45.640 --> 48:47.540]  And so I think this really scratches that itch.
[48:47.600 --> 48:51.440]  So it'll be free on the Patreon as long as you remember which which there's a free
[48:51.440 --> 48:53.420]  membership. So just sign up for free.
[48:53.940 --> 48:58.660]  You can give all of your personal information to Patreon for us every day with us.
[48:58.680 --> 49:01.140]  And if you don't want to do that at the end of all the days,
[49:01.140 --> 49:05.900]  we'll release the full video of all the days put together on our YouTube gaming channel.
[49:06.420 --> 49:08.060]  I cannot wait. I am.
[49:08.540 --> 49:09.680]  It's going to be hell.
[49:09.980 --> 49:11.460]  There's going to be so much rage.
[49:11.940 --> 49:15.260]  It's such an interesting game to do like that as well, because there'll be
[49:15.260 --> 49:19.100]  potentially like when the Jamboree buddy comes down on the map
[49:19.100 --> 49:21.980]  and then we play a mini game to see who gets him.
[49:22.320 --> 49:25.100]  And it'll be such a celebration and potentially the next day
[49:25.100 --> 49:27.680]  someone could just run past you and take him. Yes.
[49:27.680 --> 49:33.920]  Thinking about the game we just played, I had a plan laid out.
[49:34.020 --> 49:37.860]  I had all the pieces on turn six and by turn 12,
[49:38.180 --> 49:41.460]  the game and you guys had fucked me out of my plan.
[49:41.780 --> 49:45.720]  So just imagining me being so excited one night being like,
[49:45.780 --> 49:47.360]  oh, I've got everything lined up.
[49:47.460 --> 49:50.260]  And then each day for a consecutive week,
[49:50.440 --> 49:54.200]  just a phase of my plan getting destroyed
[49:54.200 --> 49:56.100]  with me not being able to do anything about it.
[49:56.100 --> 49:57.440]  Oh, it's going to be good.
[49:57.620 --> 49:59.180]  It's going to be a lot of built up.
[49:59.380 --> 50:02.700]  It's interesting that we're going to have to set an alarm every day,
[50:02.720 --> 50:05.540]  like even across all the weekends for a whole month.
[50:06.120 --> 50:07.940]  It's I'm so excited for this.
[50:08.080 --> 50:10.600]  We've been Gavin, you and I specifically have been doing this kind of content
[50:10.600 --> 50:13.240]  together for closing on two decades now, right?
[50:13.260 --> 50:14.380]  Like a very long time together.
[50:14.800 --> 50:18.680]  And I get so genuinely giddy and jazzed
[50:18.680 --> 50:22.300]  anytime there's an opportunity to do something we've never done before
[50:22.300 --> 50:24.840]  or film something in a way we've never done it before.
[50:24.840 --> 50:28.040]  And it's really rare that you get those opportunities because, you know,
[50:28.040 --> 50:32.460]  we've reinvented the wheel 16,000 times at this point.
[50:32.800 --> 50:34.920]  But we've never done anything like this before.
[50:34.980 --> 50:36.900]  And I'm so excited to see how it goes.
[50:36.940 --> 50:39.380]  And I think it's going to be miserable in all the right ways.
[50:39.380 --> 50:40.400]  And I just can't wait to see.
[50:41.280 --> 50:44.320]  It is a terrifying thing to take on from a production standpoint.
[50:44.620 --> 50:50.220]  But it is one of those things where once we get on the other side of it,
[50:50.560 --> 50:53.960]  I think learning from this process will open up a lot of possible
[50:53.960 --> 50:57.060]  fun avenues for different content ideas going forward.
[50:57.120 --> 51:00.920]  I mean, like the idea came from Andrew doing the advent calendar,
[51:01.040 --> 51:03.120]  which was really great because he did a really great job
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.480]  kind of producing that, putting it all together or whatever.
[51:05.760 --> 51:07.880]  And then we got like, oh, my gosh, this was so exciting
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.120]  because we put out something every day.
[51:10.060 --> 51:12.080]  Andrew prerecorded those with us.
[51:12.220 --> 51:14.420]  We batch recorded those in like a few days.
[51:14.540 --> 51:16.780]  We can't do that with this.
[51:16.900 --> 51:21.900]  We have to just get together every day and do this.
[51:21.900 --> 51:27.640]  I there's so much like room for error and disaster.
[51:28.020 --> 51:29.680]  This is like this is not good.
[51:29.860 --> 51:31.000]  This is not good.
[51:31.280 --> 51:33.040]  Speaking of error and disaster,
[51:33.880 --> 51:37.240]  is anybody currently have any plans to go out of town in March?
[51:37.720 --> 51:39.260]  I was. Well, not anymore.
[51:39.540 --> 51:41.620]  Not anymore. March. Yeah. OK.
[51:42.460 --> 51:43.620]  All right. I didn't either.
[51:44.520 --> 51:46.200]  Huh? I didn't either.
[51:47.360 --> 51:48.620]  Are you sure? It's possible.
[51:49.600 --> 51:51.800]  It's possible that might have changed slightly.
[51:52.080 --> 51:54.940]  You could do it. You just need to bring a switch and bring.
[51:55.420 --> 51:56.680]  What if I'm home?
[51:56.800 --> 51:59.900]  What if I'm home by 1130 the next morning
[51:59.900 --> 52:02.160]  and we can record just a few hours late at noon?
[52:02.420 --> 52:04.500]  I'm I'm I'm curious about what you mean by that,
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.020]  because I'm pretty sure I'm looking at our calendar.
[52:06.100 --> 52:07.060]  It says nine a.m. every day.
[52:07.320 --> 52:09.560]  I know. But what if I had to push it back for a couple of hours
[52:09.560 --> 52:11.380]  just because I'm a dad and I got to be a dad?
[52:11.720 --> 52:13.360]  Yeah. What if I got to do that every Friday?
[52:15.340 --> 52:15.980]  Every Friday.
[52:16.580 --> 52:18.060]  It's going to fall apart so quickly.
[52:18.060 --> 52:19.200]  It's not going to fall apart.
[52:19.260 --> 52:20.060]  We're going to hold it together,
[52:20.200 --> 52:22.260]  but we are going to have to deal with these little roadblocks.
[52:22.440 --> 52:25.000]  I am the one that has sacrificed the time.
[52:25.180 --> 52:27.100]  I don't want to hear this from you guys.
[52:27.340 --> 52:31.080]  Yeah, I trust to wake up even at 7 a.m. to make content, which is like
[52:31.080 --> 52:34.980]  I know, like in the grand scheme of work, like that is so fortunate.
[52:34.980 --> 52:40.120]  Like I've had actual really tough jobs, like I know, incredibly blessed.
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.320]  But like I am not a morning person.
[52:42.320 --> 52:44.540]  So like having to try to be on at 7 a.m.
[52:44.840 --> 52:47.360]  each day is going to be a little bit of a process.
[52:47.360 --> 52:48.440]  You're a morning person.
[52:48.440 --> 52:51.460]  If it's if it's like 4 a.m., though, like you're that kind of morning.
[52:51.600 --> 52:55.040]  You do most of your you do most of your emailing and slacking at like 515.
[52:55.560 --> 52:59.400]  And I know I'm an evening person or I'm a like I sent you guys all
[52:59.940 --> 53:04.020]  something today, except Geoff, because you just you're not going to be available for it.
[53:04.820 --> 53:07.620]  And I did that because I had a terrible sleep
[53:07.620 --> 53:10.260]  and I woke up, sent that and then went back to bed.
[53:10.560 --> 53:12.540]  Is it because you had to piss a gallon of water?
[53:13.040 --> 53:14.900]  No, it wasn't.
[53:14.900 --> 53:16.840]  Is it because you had to clean up a gallon of water
[53:16.840 --> 53:18.420]  that somehow found its way to the ground?
[53:18.560 --> 53:20.000]  Yeah, yeah, it was that steady.
[53:20.520 --> 53:21.600]  You got a crystal ball.
[53:21.780 --> 53:24.560]  I have a question about your pillow situation while we talk about you sleeping.
[53:24.880 --> 53:27.260]  Yeah. So you've got a lot of pillows because.
[53:28.020 --> 53:29.540]  I mean, the way I see it, it's kind of like
[53:30.520 --> 53:32.320]  they slip down the back of the bed, right?
[53:32.340 --> 53:34.300]  And then you just need more pillows because they keep.
[53:34.780 --> 53:38.420]  I've actually now I'm experimenting a little bit and being
[53:38.420 --> 53:40.160]  and being a no pillow guy.
[53:40.940 --> 53:42.260]  Jesus Christ. What?
[53:42.580 --> 53:44.800]  How do you go from eight pillows to no pillows?
[53:44.880 --> 53:46.060]  You're going to snap your neck in half.
[53:46.060 --> 53:46.780]  This is. Yeah.
[53:47.420 --> 53:51.220]  So COVID really screwed me up from like my sleep patterns.
[53:51.400 --> 53:53.360]  I need to sleep upright now.
[53:53.720 --> 53:58.000]  Or at least I was so like I spent so long having to do that.
[53:58.060 --> 54:00.660]  It feels unnatural not to do that now.
[54:01.200 --> 54:05.280]  So I've been experimenting with just using the wall as my pillow
[54:05.280 --> 54:06.620]  and sleeping that way.
[54:07.380 --> 54:13.520]  I. I need to buy a ticket to Vancouver Island.
[54:13.640 --> 54:15.300]  I got to I got to watch you sleep.
[54:15.300 --> 54:16.640]  That's all right.
[54:16.760 --> 54:18.660]  Can can we buy you a headboard?
[54:19.260 --> 54:21.160]  I'll that would be really nice. Install it.
[54:21.260 --> 54:23.940]  Like if you'll let me come up, you'll let Gavin and I come up.
[54:24.060 --> 54:25.780]  Yeah, you can get pillowed headboards.
[54:25.860 --> 54:29.620]  We'll buy a headboard in the NIMO and we'll come set it up for you.
[54:29.700 --> 54:33.520]  I have. So last December, I bought a new bed frame
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.420]  that has a headboard that's part of it,
[54:36.560 --> 54:39.720]  but it's too heavy to carry up all the stairs.
[54:39.720 --> 54:41.100]  So it's still there.
[54:41.360 --> 54:42.780]  So I've had this.
[54:43.020 --> 54:43.920]  Wait, how long has it been there?
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.420]  Last December.
[54:45.680 --> 54:47.880]  Not the sorry, not the previous December.
[54:47.980 --> 54:49.880]  We had the December before.
[54:50.280 --> 54:51.140]  Twenty twenty three.
[54:51.620 --> 54:52.760]  Twenty twenty. Yeah.
[54:53.460 --> 54:55.540]  You just need somebody to help you move a headboard for.
[54:55.960 --> 54:57.840]  Call me, dude. It's really heavy.
[54:58.460 --> 55:01.880]  I mean, dude, I have so much time in March to travel now.
[55:04.380 --> 55:06.520]  How did the bed get up there?
[55:07.860 --> 55:10.360]  Uh. Yeah, you know what?
[55:10.380 --> 55:12.740]  Here's the the like getting the bed up there
[55:12.740 --> 55:16.140]  was kind of like, oh, that's that's all we had.
[55:16.320 --> 55:17.200]  That's all we got.
[55:18.300 --> 55:20.260]  What? And that's all you had in you.
[55:20.540 --> 55:23.300]  Yeah. I'm still recovering from getting the bed up.
[55:23.320 --> 55:23.880]  That was heavy.
[55:24.520 --> 55:26.040]  It's a big bed. Twenty twenty three.
[55:27.300 --> 55:31.180]  Yeah, it's we're still we're trying to get the confidence together,
[55:31.320 --> 55:33.200]  the morale to get the the bed frame.
[55:33.580 --> 55:34.600]  Get it. Get it together.
[55:34.840 --> 55:36.980]  Get your bed. Get your frickin headboard up there.
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.100]  I'm getting it up. I have to.
[55:40.740 --> 55:42.860]  We want to get into the specifics of this.
[55:43.780 --> 55:46.080]  We we have some stuff we need to move around.
[55:46.260 --> 55:49.120]  And I also still have like four broken chairs
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.060]  that are just taking up space from out there.
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.000]  So we're going to have somebody come in to take those away
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.560]  because those have to go to the dump, which is a different process.
[55:57.880 --> 55:59.100]  Wasn't they all on the balcony there?
[55:59.600 --> 56:01.960]  I think I might have one on the balcony.
[56:02.040 --> 56:03.560]  What was the broken thing on the balcony?
[56:03.880 --> 56:07.500]  I have two broken chairs in the bedroom right now.
[56:07.500 --> 56:12.980]  One of them is the half chair, which I turned into like a table of sorts.
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.240]  And then my Herman Miller is and I have a walk in closet and it's in there.
[56:21.240 --> 56:22.940]  Why'd you keep all this junk for you?
[56:23.200 --> 56:25.520]  There's no because it's tough to get rid of the chairs.
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.920]  I know I actively want to get rid of it.
[56:27.940 --> 56:30.940]  It's just they're heavy, they're bulky and they have to go to a specific place.
[56:31.100 --> 56:34.220]  Well, for a start, the Herman Miller, you can almost certainly get
[56:34.660 --> 56:35.640]  swapped under warranty.
[56:35.860 --> 56:36.720]  That is what I.
[56:36.720 --> 56:39.380]  Yeah, so that has been the one where it's like I need to keep this
[56:39.380 --> 56:42.400]  because I need to figure out the warranty or I was looking into replacing
[56:42.400 --> 56:44.360]  the seat myself. I think I could do that.
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.080]  But the other chairs are like just completely broken.
[56:48.180 --> 56:51.420]  So I need to get rid of those, create a lot more space.
[56:51.600 --> 56:56.700]  I love the the way you have to work up to just regular tasks.
[56:57.940 --> 57:03.160]  If you'll if you'll let Gavin and I or some some contingent of regulation
[57:03.160 --> 57:08.360]  come up and spend three days with you, we can revolutionize your life.
[57:08.680 --> 57:12.180]  We can make things so much easier and simpler for you.
[57:12.360 --> 57:13.940]  First of all, always welcome to come up.
[57:14.200 --> 57:16.500]  Second of all, I'm in the process of that right now.
[57:16.580 --> 57:17.840]  Very excited. OK, OK.
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.380]  I look forward to hearing more about that in the coming episodes.
[57:22.900 --> 57:24.620]  Oh, it's going to be soon. Next few weeks.
[57:25.300 --> 57:26.340]  Where is it downstairs?
[57:26.980 --> 57:28.980]  It's as soon as you walk in the front door.
[57:29.120 --> 57:30.400]  It's just in the entryway.
[57:31.100 --> 57:32.500]  Are you not sick of looking at it?
[57:32.500 --> 57:35.900]  No. It's just a box. It's a cardboard box.
[57:36.340 --> 57:39.300]  OK, we're definitely going to box that for a year.
[57:39.800 --> 57:40.840]  I don't see it often.
[57:41.200 --> 57:42.100]  We can't come in March.
[57:42.400 --> 57:44.600]  And I've got something in the late April.
[57:44.820 --> 57:48.400]  It's going to be set up before the end, before March.
[57:48.700 --> 57:50.820]  If that headboard, I'm going to tell you right now, Andrew,
[57:50.960 --> 57:53.920]  as you're going to get set up as one of your best friends on Earth.
[57:54.020 --> 57:55.740]  I tell you this with peace and love.
[57:55.760 --> 58:00.540]  If that headboard is in your hallway on your first floor by the third week of April,
[58:00.540 --> 58:03.560]  you will not be able to stop me from coming up and installing it for you.
[58:03.700 --> 58:04.540]  That's just not going to happen.
[58:04.780 --> 58:06.380]  I don't mind taking care of before then.
[58:06.460 --> 58:07.840]  It will be handled by me.
[58:08.100 --> 58:12.380]  The problem, here's my only concern is when I bought it, I ordered it off of Amazon
[58:13.180 --> 58:16.960]  and I saw some of the reviews said that they were missing parts from it.
[58:17.460 --> 58:18.540]  So I'm a little concerned about that.
[58:18.680 --> 58:19.740]  That's the only hurdle I have.
[58:20.100 --> 58:23.220]  So there's I assume there's a hardware store in Canada.
[58:23.600 --> 58:25.200]  You've been concerned about it since 2023.
[58:25.820 --> 58:27.540]  It's been a thought since 2013.
[58:27.740 --> 58:30.300]  It's going to be hard to return it if it's missing parts.
[58:30.540 --> 58:33.260]  And when you open it and find out when you can still return it,
[58:33.300 --> 58:34.860]  then I get parts everywhere.
[58:35.840 --> 58:37.040]  Well, not all of them.
[58:37.120 --> 58:41.580]  I got bit like this one time, Andrew, when we were back in my old house
[58:41.580 --> 58:44.000]  and in my previous life, right?
[58:44.360 --> 58:47.760]  We were redoing the living room for some reason and we bought a sofa
[58:47.760 --> 58:51.540]  and it came shrink wrapped together and we couldn't shrink wrap it
[58:51.540 --> 58:53.760]  and put it together because the house was all in a jumble. Right.
[58:53.980 --> 58:57.760]  So it ended up just kind of sitting there and became part of a project
[58:57.760 --> 59:01.360]  that took months and months to to finish.
[59:01.520 --> 59:03.400]  And it just kept getting pushed from room to room.
[59:03.580 --> 59:07.420]  And at some point, we finally unwrapped on like opened up the sofa
[59:07.420 --> 59:12.780]  and it was cracked in half and it was too late to return it.
[59:12.980 --> 59:15.780]  Oh, no, because we passed the window to return it.
[59:15.800 --> 59:18.220]  And I just bought a eighteen hundred dollar sofa that was broken.
[59:18.320 --> 59:18.960]  I had to throw away.
[59:19.120 --> 59:22.540]  So I didn't open and check for the parts sooner than later.
[59:22.600 --> 59:23.900]  This would be my. Yeah.
[59:23.960 --> 59:27.320]  And if it was a large investment, I definitely would be more on top of it.
[59:27.320 --> 59:28.620]  I got it pretty cheap.
[59:28.840 --> 59:30.540]  So not as much of a concern.
[59:30.740 --> 59:32.840]  Is it soft? Is what soft?
[59:32.960 --> 59:35.040]  The headboard. I have no idea.
[59:35.600 --> 59:37.820]  I don't even remember what it looks like fully, to be honest.
[59:38.160 --> 59:39.200]  Well, why were you talking about that?
[59:39.320 --> 59:40.920]  We were talking about getting you like a pillowed one.
[59:41.500 --> 59:42.820]  Yeah. So you can sleep upright.
[59:43.540 --> 59:44.620]  Yeah, like mine.
[59:44.780 --> 59:49.400]  So I guess I brought it up because that was the solution to the problem I had.
[59:49.540 --> 59:50.680]  And I've had it.
[59:50.700 --> 59:52.100]  I just haven't been able to implement it.
[59:52.340 --> 59:53.360]  How would that be the solution?
[59:53.840 --> 59:57.160]  Because one of my issues is that the bed moves from the wall
[59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.160]  and so by having a headboard, the wall comes with me.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.760]  Can I make a new prediction for 2025?
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.920]  Of course. Andrew breaks his headboard.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.240]  No, that's pretty good. That's a good prediction.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.500]  Oh, no. If you constantly are pushing your bed away from the wall,
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.320]  you're going to snap that headboard off.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.500]  I guess it's possible, but
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.360]  now that's it, that's it, that's a not to derail us here,
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:25.960]  but that's an interesting idea.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:30.120]  Should we have a midseason check in like in around June or July or August?
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:30.680]  Yeah, sure.
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.120]  Can we see how our predictions are going?
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.480]  And then maybe everybody gets to make one more prediction.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.440]  Oh, that's yeah, I like that.
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.460]  Like a midyear prediction.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.180]  What if it was like a 10 second long thing and I just said,
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.160]  y'all still married and then we just moved on?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.820]  So is it that you can't fall asleep lying down
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.840]  or you actually have to sleep upright?
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.540]  It's just something where like when I I had to sleep upright
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.400]  because I got so sick and I couldn't breathe otherwise.
[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.380]  Yeah. And now it just nothing else feels natural.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.760]  So I just have to sit up.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.740]  Because I wonder if you could start sleeping set up
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:11.920]  and then we could get a bed that just lowers you down after you fall asleep.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.640]  That naturally kind of happens.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.500]  And then I end up slumping down.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:18.940]  I end up, yes, sliding down naturally.
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.240]  How do you try and fall asleep, bowl upright though?
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.800]  I close my eyes.
[01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.480]  What's relaxing about that enough to like drop off?
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.340]  I don't know.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.840]  I had to like it doesn't bother me.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:30.840]  I just sit upright.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.000]  That's that's really impressive.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.580]  Oh, holy shit.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.220]  You OK? I just got I just got news.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.200]  San Antonio Spurs announced Victor Wim Binyama
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.000]  will miss the rest of the season with a blood clot.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:45.380]  Dude, did you? That's one point.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.920]  I was going to sign off with this and say, hey, Nick, check this out.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.200]  And then send this picture.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:51.920]  Dude.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.520]  Yep. Hey, Spurs tickets should be pretty cheap.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.460]  Blood clots are fucking career enders like no joke.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.280]  That ended Chris Bosh's career.
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.480]  Yep. And that's not that's not a thing you fuck around with.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.320]  It's in the shoulder. God, that sucks.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.260]  Yep. That sucks for Nick.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.880]  What's scary is that really super athletic people get blood clots.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.400]  And this. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:14.940]  That sucks for Wimby.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.700]  I I know we're getting a little bit long.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.040]  I have a clip I really want to play.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.060]  I have something very exciting to bring to this.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.160]  This is an old clip.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.160]  We've been talking about history.
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:26.580]  I think there are probably people that listen to the show
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.580]  that weren't even around for this era.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.180]  But you may remember way back in the past, we once had a pencil trial
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.100]  on this show that went very well.
[01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.560]  Everybody loved it.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.180]  And we had.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:44.500]  The whole thing between it was myself against Geoff and Gavin
[01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:47.780]  over whether I needed to eat this pencil or not.
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.500]  And Eric found a website
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.680]  that called Hired Judge, which I became a judge on
[01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.460]  and people could give rulings.
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.120]  So first, I'm going to I'm going to play this clip related to that.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.060]  And then you'll find out why.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.240]  Hello, this is Shaheen Davari.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.940]  I'm from Hired Judge.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.900]  I also was an attorney for three years and went to law school.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:17.340]  And so I'd like to start by saying at the very top
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:21.240]  that it is patently obvious to anybody
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.360]  who both listens to the podcast and understands the scenario
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:29.940]  that Andrew should, in fact, have to eat a pencil.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.800]  First, he made the agreement and made the bet.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:38.600]  And I want to say that up top because there was some type of backtracking
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.660]  that Andrew was trying to pretend that truth isn't truth.
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.880]  And it wasn't really him.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.800]  But truth is truth, my friend.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.660]  It was clearly your voice and it was recorded.
[01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.940]  And that evidence definitely weighed heavily on the decision here today.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.600]  Second, the crackpot legal defense team
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:00.240]  did not do their job enough to get paid.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.420]  So I really hope that you did not pay these people saying that
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.360]  you didn't properly define a term in the contract
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.840]  isn't necessary in oral agreement contract.
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.780]  And it's not a necessary in contracts.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.600]  What's necessary in a contract is an understanding between the parties
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.680]  as to what the pencil is.
[01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:24.100]  You both understood what you meant by pencil.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.020]  No lead. You don't want any lead.
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.040]  You don't want someone to get poisoned.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:31.680]  Graphite pencils are perfectly harmless to eat in very small amounts,
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:32.780]  meaning one pencil.
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:37.320]  And so buck up and
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.820]  eat the fucking pencil.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:40.860]  Remember, well, favor.
[01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:44.680]  And now, OK, so you're reminding us that you welched on the bet again.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.020]  You're bringing this all to the forefront again.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.220]  I'm so excited for whatever turn this is.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.020]  That is an aside.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.260]  You're crazy. No, no, no, no.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.820]  You're going to understand in a minute.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.980]  This is crazy.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.800]  Shane Daivari, honorable man.
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:02.200]  He is competing on Survivor this season.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.100]  What? A contestant?
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.240]  No way!
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.860]  Shane Daivari, the guy that was a judge in My Pencil Ruling,
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:17.960]  is a cast member on this upcoming season of Survivor that starts next week.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.700]  What? Did you just see the cast list and be like, I recognize that name?
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:26.900]  Somebody on I don't remember where and I tried to find them brought up
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:30.600]  that this was a thing and I went, there's no fucking way that that's true.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.780]  And then I confirmed it and I could not find whoever's comment it was.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.440]  Thank you so much. Whoever commented and made this connection.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.880]  I went back and I listened and I looked into this same guy.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.980]  The Pencil Judge is on Survivor this season.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.680]  And I am. It's such a shame he didn't put that as his occupation.
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.460]  Yeah. Pencil Judge.
[01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.060]  I haven't watched the last two seasons of Survivor.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.680]  I couldn't be more into this season of Survivor.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.500]  I got to see how I feel like we're Team Shaheen.
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.820]  You've missed out, dude.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.380]  This last season of Survivor was one of the best. It was so good.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:04.240]  I don't watch Survivor.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.700]  I might have to watch Survivor.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.800]  They have to be locked in on this.
[01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:09.500]  I think we got to.
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.760]  We should do a little watch parties and cheer for him.
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.740]  And I'll stop watching it as soon as he gets voted off.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.420]  Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.680]  I'll do all of that, but continue watching it.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:19.760]  I cannot wait.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.860]  This is so Andrew. This is crazy.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.040]  Insane. If he wins. Oh, my God.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:26.140]  I can't imagine.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.700]  Imagine if he's like a Russell Hance-like villain.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.580]  Oh, there's so many. I have no idea.
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.120]  We're going to find out.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.380]  I cannot wait.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.300]  And I wish him the best of luck.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:38.480]  We have one degree of separation from Survivor.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.680]  Yeah. It's not like he's on some dog shit show that none of us have heard of.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.300]  He's on Survivor, which you talk about all the time.
[01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.300]  One of my favorite shows growing up and I've only recently sort of fallen off of.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.580]  But I'm back on. Fully invested.
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.920]  Let me ask you this.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.800]  And then we can we can start wrapping up here in just a minute.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:58.700]  He's going to be on this, but he ruled against you, Andrew.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.200]  He said that you need to eat the pencil.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.420]  Do you think that that's going to sort of shade
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.000]  the way that you see him as he makes decisions throughout the season?
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:08.480]  Such a great question, Eric.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:12.040]  And that was as immediately confronted with, do I want him to win
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.440]  or should I be actively cheering against him?
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.020]  And it ultimately came to that he was always in the right on the ruling.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.800]  The ruling was the right call.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:25.400]  It would be insane for me to be against him because he was right.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.640]  I was being a shit in that scenario.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.420]  And I feel like just further being a shit is not the answer.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.980]  So I'm fully on his team.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.080]  Wow. Cheering for Shane.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.400]  I can't wait. I cannot wait to watch this season.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.580]  We got a regulation contestant.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.800]  Yep. Dude, we're Daivari heads.
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.760]  I love this.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.120]  I think if he wins, you got to eat the pencil.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.840]  Yeah, I agree. Yeah.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.500]  I'm glad that you guys have a consensus. That's awesome.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.120]  It's great. I did.
[01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:03.180]  You know, one of us did predict it would happen in 2025 in the Nostradamus draft.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.920]  So yeah, very interesting.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.740]  Suck down some of that plumbum.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.240]  I just had to share that. I'm so excited.
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.900]  And oh, that's phenomenal.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.860]  That is unbelievable. What a crazy coincidence.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.020]  Also, please do me a favor and watch the last season of Survivor, Andrew.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.060]  I will. I will get there.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.000]  Yes, I promise.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:26.920]  The one before I don't care about, but this last one, I'll watch it.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.640]  Oh, should we?
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.840]  Should we fuck off?
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.500]  You should wrap up because you have to go.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.580]  You have to get on a flight or something.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.840]  I do. I'm leaving here to go to the airport.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.380]  He's trying to get all of his travel in before March hits.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.300]  One tiny trip.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.280]  One tiny trip in March that I immediately booked after I agreed
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.480]  not to go on any trips in March.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:48.000]  You know, when you told us about this trip and you were like,
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.980]  obviously, I've mentioned this months ago, but it's coming up.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.620]  And I just want to remind everyone that I'm out of town on Thursday.
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.620]  That was the first time you told us, right?
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.640]  No, I don't think so.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.820]  I think I put it in the in the slack the second it happened.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.180]  Here's what we're going to have to do.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.660]  Unfortunately, we're going to have to pay for slack to see if Geoff
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:06.100]  let us know or not.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:08.120]  Huh? And either way, I win.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:11.020]  Either we pay for slack and I'm wrong and I get a paid for slack
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.940]  or we pay for slack and I'm right and I get a paid for slack.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:16.100]  What are you going to do with a paid for slack?
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.740]  I don't know. Argue better.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:18.700]  Argue better?
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.420]  You think you let us know before December?
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.680]  Help Nick find that file he's looking for?
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.200]  Yeah. So wait, if you have to scroll that far back in slack, you
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.680]  you let us know like three months ago?
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:34.360]  I would assume so. Yeah, it's been planned for a very long time.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.120]  OK. All right. We'll have to we'll we'll take a look.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.680]  We got to get paid for slack and then we'll do it.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.860]  Can you host your own slack server or do you have to pay him?
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.220]  I don't know how it works.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.920]  I think you probably have to pay him.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.360]  I assume. I don't know.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.260]  It all exists on their server.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:51.160]  They just have locked it away from us. Yes.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.100]  Yeah, I believe that's how it works. Mm hmm.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.920]  Yep. If you have a better solution, I'd love it.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.380]  But that's what we're locked in with right now.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.340]  And we'll find out next time, potentially.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.300]  Did we pay for the slack? Did we not?
[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.180]  Mm hmm. Tune in next week.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.360]  Do we have nitro? I do. Yeah.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:09.380]  Why do I have it?
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:12.060]  Yeah, where's mine? I pay for it personally.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.280]  Yeah, I don't care if you have nitro. I don't give a shit.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.060]  Could I have nitro? No.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.240]  You have a fucking company credit card.
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.260]  I use it.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.140]  Yeah, I'm going to use it without talking to you guys.
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.600]  I'll just stop buying shit.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.880]  That makes sense. That makes sense.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.500]  I think it's the premise of how do you have nitro?
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.080]  I paid for it. I just pay for it.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.120]  You can pay for it.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.280]  I know. I know. Dumbass.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.400]  I'm saying that you're the one that asked.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.740]  Did Eric give it to you?
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.360]  And I was going to kick off about it.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.880]  Well, I know that now, don't I?
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:40.680]  I don't have a company card.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.840]  I wasn't. Wait, what?
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:45.960]  I wasn't saying physically, how do you have it?
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:46.940]  Like what? What was?
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:51.840]  If anybody legitimately wants a company card, I can get one issued for you.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.100]  Why doesn't Nick have one?
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.920]  Yeah, why does he need one?
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.420]  Why does why does why do you need one?
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.280]  Why did I give you one?
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:57.860]  I don't even know.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.080]  To buy games that we play.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.500]  Yeah, just give yours to Nick.
[01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:01.660]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.860]  Just give yours to Nick and then he'll have one.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.140]  I used it for buying a domain.
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.360]  Considering that when I got a company card for Let's Play,
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.560]  I was told explicitly you two could not be trusted with them.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.440]  The fact that you both just have them.
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.300]  Well, I told them when we worked at Rooster Teeth,
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:19.100]  I told them up front that I wasn't going to do any reporting for it.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.400]  And they said, OK, we won't give you one.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:20.980]  And I said, fine.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:23.820]  Yeah, because I knew I wouldn't.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.100]  I knew that it would annoy them. It would annoy me.
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.360]  I might as well just not have one.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:28.380]  Can I tell you guys something funny?
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.340]  I was going through like old mail the other day and just like cleaning up my
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:36.260]  my house. And I found a letter from American Express
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.380]  that I had just never opened.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:41.360]  And I opened it up and it was my new credit card from Rooster Teeth.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.940]  I guess I had just never noticed and activated my final Rooster Teeth
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:49.140]  American Express card.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.500]  It's pretty cool. Perfect time to activate it.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.520]  I did not activate it.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.760]  Do you think it works if you did?
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.060]  I do not think it works.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.060]  I don't think there's anything it's tied to anymore.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:07.180]  They finally they finally killed my email access three weeks ago.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.700]  I'm sure that the credit cards went away a long time ago.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.660]  What if it's just linked directly to the Warner Media account?
[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.600]  Then you'd be committing some sort of illegal activity by using it, I would assume.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:18.220]  What if it's just Bernie's now?
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.400]  Yeah, just charge it against him. It's fine.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:24.520]  That's funny.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.020]  Yep.
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.040]  OK, let's wrap this up.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.340]  Should we really fuck off this time?
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.780]  Yeah. Wait, where'd the blood come from?
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.440]  Where'd the blood come from?
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:32.680]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:33.820]  There's no more.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.120]  I uh...
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:35.300]  Sweet.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.220]  I don't know.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.700]  There's no more.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.140]  There's no more blood.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:38.860]  I forgot about it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.320]  I don't see it.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:39.980]  Let's wrap up, I guess.
[01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:40.940]  All right.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.160]  Well, there you go.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.500]  You have now listened to the forty...
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500]  What episode was this?
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:47.780]  Second?
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.820]  No, no. Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:53.140]  Forty second episode of the Regulation Podcast from start to finish.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.440]  I assume it would be weird if you just fast forwarded to this part.
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.720]  Although, hey, man, whatever floats your boat.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.920]  I'm not here to yuck your yum, as the young kids say these days.
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.040]  Thanks for listening.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.020]  I know it's the worst, right?
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.380]  It's not collab bad, but it's up there.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.740]  Thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.180]  I hope it was entertaining for you.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.440]  It was certainly something on our end.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.440]  And we'd appreciate it if you'd let somebody in your life
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.020]  know about the Regulation Podcast, maybe a friend, family member,
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:24.300]  co-worker, doctor, accountant, advisor,
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.340]  maybe your H.R. department, old teacher,
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:32.320]  maybe a childhood friend, maybe a childhood bully
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.480]  that you're trying to reconnect with.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.740]  Maybe somebody that you need to make a lifelong apology to.
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.460]  Maybe somebody that you've had a crush on your entire life.
[01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:41.120]  Can you please end this so you can go to the fucking airport?
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.380]  Maybe it's just Eric, I don't know.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.900]  But let somebody know.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.960]  If you wouldn't mind, we'd appreciate it.
[01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.120]  And we'll be here next week saying the same dumb shit.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.480]  I imagine Gavin's balls will come up at some point.
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:54.840]  So you don't want to miss that. Bye bye.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.700]  Eric left. Yeah, he did.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:58.960]  What is this? Face.
