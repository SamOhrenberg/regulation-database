[00:00.000 --> 00:03.340]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.620 --> 00:05.140]  This is episode 43.
[00:06.040 --> 00:07.440]  What do you got going on over there, Andrew?
[00:07.820 --> 00:10.520]  I'm just... I felt like you wanted some energy.
[00:10.660 --> 00:11.980]  I'm here. I'm bringing the energy for you, Geoff.
[00:12.020 --> 00:12.620]  Go ahead. Continue.
[00:13.140 --> 00:14.880]  Gizmo here just gizmoing it up. Go ahead.
[00:18.280 --> 00:20.040]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:20.340 --> 00:22.720]  Folks around these parts call me Baby Pepsi.
[00:23.260 --> 00:28.860]  With me, as always, Gavin or Gassy Goo, Andrew or Interrupty Gizmo.
[00:30.360 --> 00:33.440]  Eric or Lil Ricky B or the Mecha Nick.
[00:33.980 --> 00:37.120]  I saw a comment that really got to me, and I don't know why,
[00:37.440 --> 00:39.520]  on somewhere on last episode, somebody said,
[00:39.600 --> 00:41.400]  Man, I haven't listened to Rooster Teeth in a really long time.
[00:41.700 --> 00:43.600]  I saw that you guys were making content. I wanted to check it out.
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.360]  I tuned into this Regulation Podcast and you guys sound like radio DJs.
[00:47.380 --> 00:48.640]  And I was immediately turned off.
[00:50.440 --> 00:52.560]  Because you were doing your radio DJ bit?
[00:53.660 --> 00:56.460]  Yeah, because it was the first time we were doing the new nicknames.
[00:56.720 --> 00:58.220]  Gassy Goo and the Gizmo!
[00:58.640 --> 00:59.900]  Really fucked me up.
[01:00.040 --> 01:02.040]  I had so much fun doing that for one episode.
[01:02.160 --> 01:04.020]  And that has to be the one episode somebody tunes in and goes,
[01:04.100 --> 01:06.420]  What the fuck is this? Shut down.
[01:06.820 --> 01:07.720]  This is a Minecraft.
[01:08.420 --> 01:11.020]  Shouldn't we treat every episode like it might be somebody's first episode?
[01:11.420 --> 01:14.200]  What if they love Morning Zoo radio, though?
[01:14.880 --> 01:17.000]  Then they love Mechanic and Baby Pepsi in the morning!
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  Welcome to the Regulation Podcast!
[01:20.580 --> 01:22.300]  I wouldn't say this one was much better,
[01:22.760 --> 01:26.440]  because this one had Andrew going, Ho, ho, ho, hey, through the intro.
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.340]  That's right. Bringing the energy.
[01:28.540 --> 01:31.880]  I was already in my head before we started because of that comment.
[01:32.040 --> 01:34.080]  And then Andrew really threw me for a loop.
[01:34.380 --> 01:35.860]  Now I'm thinking we might be...
[01:35.860 --> 01:36.920]  Did my energy make you?
[01:40.640 --> 01:42.120]  You know what I was about to say?
[01:42.160 --> 01:44.440]  We might be in the running for a worst intro of Regulation,
[01:44.520 --> 01:46.100]  but that completely flipped it back around.
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.840]  Not with Rob64 at all.
[01:51.860 --> 01:53.420]  Yeah, Morning Zoo!
[01:54.100 --> 01:56.540]  This, uh, this sucks.
[01:56.740 --> 01:58.840]  And Eric was doing this all throughout the stream the other day.
[01:59.100 --> 02:00.700]  Yeah, I was driving me crazy!
[02:00.720 --> 02:02.900]  Is it a voice changer? What do you have?
[02:03.020 --> 02:05.520]  It is really good. Yeah, it has a voice changer on that thing.
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.280]  Listen, boys, we have a lot to get to today.
[02:08.540 --> 02:10.460]  We have more than we can cover in an hour.
[02:10.860 --> 02:13.400]  There's a thing on my desk that Andrew sent to Gavin and I.
[02:13.480 --> 02:14.220]  We have to talk about.
[02:14.480 --> 02:17.080]  Last week, I told you guys about my Deja Vu nightmare.
[02:17.340 --> 02:18.960]  I got to update you.
[02:19.200 --> 02:21.160]  There are troubling developments.
[02:21.160 --> 02:23.400]  It is no longer a Deja Vu nightmare.
[02:23.600 --> 02:26.460]  It is just a midnight bathroom nightmare.
[02:27.380 --> 02:30.100]  Two of the... I'm going to warn you guys now.
[02:30.640 --> 02:32.440]  Two of the grosser stories you're going to hear.
[02:32.800 --> 02:34.680]  Oh, no. Yeah.
[02:34.940 --> 02:36.440]  Am I going to gag? Do I need a bag?
[02:36.800 --> 02:38.120]  You might need a gag bag.
[02:38.140 --> 02:41.200]  Can we do them at the end then? Because we've been front loading gross.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.260]  Can we put at the back?
[02:42.560 --> 02:44.220]  Plus, I'll leave it up to you guys.
[02:44.260 --> 02:46.000]  Do you want to front load it or back load it?
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.080]  No, I want to back load it.
[02:47.440 --> 02:48.740]  There's a lot of front loading on the gross.
[02:48.740 --> 02:49.700]  There might be.
[02:50.120 --> 02:51.620]  They might take a little time to tell.
[02:51.860 --> 02:54.140]  So and there'll be there'll be conversation.
[02:54.140 --> 02:55.720]  So we don't want to wait too long.
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.260]  Otherwise, we'll piss Eric off.
[02:57.540 --> 03:00.400]  We might need to make a uniform gag bag.
[03:01.460 --> 03:03.140]  Oh, interesting. Interesting.
[03:03.860 --> 03:04.900]  I'm not mad at that.
[03:04.960 --> 03:07.700]  I could use that in fucking Los Angeles last weekend.
[03:07.740 --> 03:09.040]  Let me tell you. Oh, God.
[03:09.080 --> 03:10.420]  Sorry, Anaheim.
[03:10.840 --> 03:14.540]  I mean, I am holding in my hand, Andrew, a gift from you.
[03:14.600 --> 03:16.740]  Would you like to tell me why and what it is?
[03:16.740 --> 03:20.860]  Well, we are a few days into Mario Party March at this point.
[03:20.900 --> 03:21.620]  When does this come out?
[03:21.640 --> 03:23.380]  Like the third, the fourth?
[03:23.920 --> 03:25.100]  That's almost there.
[03:25.560 --> 03:26.360]  Almost there.
[03:26.460 --> 03:27.640]  Fifth? The fifth!
[03:28.140 --> 03:28.860]  The fifth.
[03:29.140 --> 03:31.940]  So we're five days in to this Mario Party March game.
[03:32.100 --> 03:33.700]  We're about to go into a heated battle.
[03:33.940 --> 03:38.060]  But before things get heated, I wanted to cool things out.
[03:38.120 --> 03:41.760]  I wanted to send a peace offering to Gavin and Geoff.
[03:41.780 --> 03:43.740]  And I would have sent one to Nick, but I don't know where he lives.
[03:43.760 --> 03:44.460]  So I couldn't do it.
[03:44.460 --> 03:45.580]  Couldn't send it.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.860]  Maybe we should change his new name to Nick Mysterio.
[03:50.100 --> 03:51.000]  Nick Mysterious.
[03:51.140 --> 03:54.000]  Geoff, have you revealed what was in your bag?
[03:54.580 --> 03:58.280]  I'm eating a chocolate Dilly Bar.
[03:58.540 --> 04:00.900]  That's right. A Dilly Bar from the Dilkong.
[04:01.400 --> 04:03.340]  A peace offering from the Dilkong.
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.300]  Little Dilly Bar for you guys.
[04:05.540 --> 04:06.680]  Before we initiate.
[04:07.300 --> 04:07.880]  Can I tell you something?
[04:08.220 --> 04:08.540]  Uh-huh.
[04:09.020 --> 04:10.100]  It's Dillicious.
[04:10.580 --> 04:13.240]  Oh, that's what I want to hear is the Dilkong.
[04:13.780 --> 04:16.460]  So just remember these first few turns.
[04:17.100 --> 04:20.600]  If you, you know, maybe you land on a boo, maybe you have the opportunity
[04:20.600 --> 04:21.520]  to screw somebody.
[04:21.640 --> 04:24.180]  Don't forget, Dilkong was there for you before we started.
[04:25.700 --> 04:28.220]  Dilkong offering a peaceful Dilly Bar.
[04:28.800 --> 04:31.780]  Did you search Austin for Dill food?
[04:32.320 --> 04:36.200]  No, I just all I could think of because I'm familiar with the Dairy Queen menu.
[04:36.560 --> 04:39.080]  All I did was search if you both had a Dairy Queen that would serve.
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.220]  Let me tell you guys, when I think Dairy Queen, I'm locked in on that.
[04:43.220 --> 04:45.880]  I'm familiar with the Dairy Queen menu, thank you.
[04:46.540 --> 04:46.820]  I am.
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.120]  Goodness, and it's giant dill pickles.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.600]  Yeah, but Dilly, I think it's funnier.
[04:51.800 --> 04:53.180]  I appreciate the ice cream. Thank you.
[04:53.200 --> 04:54.360]  I just sent you my address.
[04:55.000 --> 04:56.860]  Send it to me, Nick, and then I'll send you a Dilly Bar.
[04:57.500 --> 04:58.580]  OK. All right.
[04:59.000 --> 05:00.360]  Good to know. I'll do that after the show.
[05:01.040 --> 05:01.420]  I got you.
[05:01.840 --> 05:02.500]  Woof. All right.
[05:02.740 --> 05:05.080]  So is that is bribery allowed?
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.060]  Are we accepting that?
[05:06.380 --> 05:10.440]  Well, if it's fucking you, are we putting a rule down now?
[05:11.360 --> 05:13.200]  I mean, so I think I cleared it.
[05:13.200 --> 05:15.160]  I think we should be open to it.
[05:15.180 --> 05:16.620]  I have accepted it into my tummy.
[05:16.840 --> 05:17.480]  It's a little late.
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.420]  I think bribery, once the game is in play, is off limits.
[05:21.540 --> 05:22.320]  See, I disagree.
[05:22.340 --> 05:27.800]  I disagree with that because I think bribery day to day
[05:27.800 --> 05:32.720]  is such an exciting element when you are four days in
[05:32.720 --> 05:36.360]  and you see alliances starting to form and you're like, oh, I understand.
[05:36.560 --> 05:37.720]  I got to get Nick on my side.
[05:38.100 --> 05:42.020]  My issue, Eric, is that the stronghold chest
[05:42.020 --> 05:44.200]  is not equal amongst all parties.
[05:44.680 --> 05:49.240]  I would be a fool to put bribery into play.
[05:50.240 --> 05:51.060]  Well, you never know.
[05:51.180 --> 05:56.160]  We'll see what happens on day 22 when Gavin introduces the bribery wheel.
[05:56.500 --> 05:57.760]  Oh, my God.
[05:58.300 --> 05:59.700]  What are we eating, Gavin?
[06:01.120 --> 06:04.800]  Corn. I'm trying to think of who would I want to make an alliance with the most.
[06:04.960 --> 06:08.560]  If you're going to try to bribe us with corn, you're in...
[06:08.560 --> 06:09.480]  That's an uphill battle.
[06:09.480 --> 06:12.460]  Americans love corn. Everything is corn.
[06:12.920 --> 06:14.500]  It is true. Everything is corn.
[06:14.840 --> 06:17.820]  We do like corn, but because it's plentiful, not because it's sought after.
[06:18.440 --> 06:18.900]  Or good.
[06:20.820 --> 06:22.200]  I have a clip.
[06:23.120 --> 06:23.780]  Go for it.
[06:24.220 --> 06:25.120]  I have a very exciting clip.
[06:25.280 --> 06:26.600]  I've got a... this is very funny.
[06:27.240 --> 06:30.020]  So as we talked about last episode,
[06:30.840 --> 06:35.460]  we have the pencil judge is competing on this season of Survivor.
[06:35.800 --> 06:37.060]  Yes. It's insane.
[06:37.060 --> 06:38.820]  Yeah, we have a connection to the show.
[06:39.020 --> 06:42.860]  And when we discovered this, I immediately reached out to a friend
[06:42.860 --> 06:45.900]  who does a lot of reality TV coverage named Terran.
[06:46.360 --> 06:50.000]  And they work for Rob as a podcast, which is like this big reality TV network.
[06:50.340 --> 06:54.060]  So I immediately was like, this is crazy because he's a fan of the show.
[06:54.160 --> 06:54.640]  And he listens.
[06:55.700 --> 06:57.800]  And I was breaking down the pencil thing to him.
[06:58.240 --> 07:01.820]  And they do a draft podcast at the start of every season
[07:01.820 --> 07:05.180]  in which they pick players.
[07:05.380 --> 07:06.540]  It's like a pool of six.
[07:06.540 --> 07:09.440]  It's like they do a fantasy draft and then whoever wins, wins.
[07:09.520 --> 07:11.680]  Like it's very standard how it works.
[07:12.440 --> 07:15.900]  And he planned on because he thought there's no way
[07:15.900 --> 07:19.440]  that he would end up getting him based off of the pencil thing
[07:19.440 --> 07:20.680]  and just where he'd end up in the draft.
[07:20.920 --> 07:22.660]  But he ended up with the first overall pick.
[07:23.140 --> 07:24.340]  So he was very excited.
[07:24.820 --> 07:27.680]  He planned like he worked out in his head that he was going to make a bunch
[07:27.680 --> 07:31.140]  of references to the show and asking questions for whoever picked them.
[07:31.400 --> 07:34.440]  But then he got the first overall pick, got really excited
[07:34.440 --> 07:38.160]  and then just picked him based off of the pencil judge thing,
[07:38.180 --> 07:41.080]  but didn't factor in that he would then have to justify
[07:41.080 --> 07:43.920]  why he took this guy first overall.
[07:44.360 --> 07:47.340]  And they started pressing and he did not necessarily have answers
[07:47.340 --> 07:49.040]  beyond the podcast thing.
[07:49.540 --> 07:50.300]  It was very funny.
[07:50.600 --> 07:54.100]  He kept making very pointed references to he's a big fan of his judgment.
[07:54.580 --> 07:57.900]  And anyone who's a fan of our show, which there are a lot of comments
[07:57.900 --> 08:01.480]  of that thing of pencil eating and references.
[08:01.480 --> 08:03.680]  I have a clip from that or the very end.
[08:03.800 --> 08:05.520]  They've kind of discussed all their points.
[08:05.640 --> 08:09.160]  And he really put himself in a tight spot and he dropped the pencil
[08:09.160 --> 08:13.780]  eating reference to a group of people that have no point of reference
[08:13.780 --> 08:15.340]  for what he's talking about.
[08:15.500 --> 08:19.380]  And it was the most confusing thing to this group of people.
[08:19.500 --> 08:20.680]  And it brought me so much joy.
[08:20.940 --> 08:25.700]  So this is him referencing that he is a fan of the survivor player
[08:25.700 --> 08:27.020]  because of his pencil opinions.
[08:27.180 --> 08:28.020]  He's a big fan.
[08:28.180 --> 08:30.760]  I've been told that he is pro pencil eating.
[08:30.760 --> 08:33.040]  So that's that was enough for me.
[08:33.040 --> 08:33.800]  What does that mean?
[08:35.960 --> 08:37.120]  Like he eats pencils?
[08:37.820 --> 08:38.640]  No, not him.
[08:38.720 --> 08:41.320]  It's just, you know, you should follow through on things that you said
[08:41.320 --> 08:41.720]  you're going to do.
[08:41.820 --> 08:44.240]  That's that's that's what he feels is what I feel.
[08:46.700 --> 08:47.640]  Did I miss something?
[08:49.080 --> 08:50.420]  Yeah, we all get it, Chappelle.
[08:50.960 --> 08:52.740]  OK, I don't know why you're confused.
[08:53.240 --> 08:53.620]  All right.
[08:54.300 --> 08:56.980]  Shout out to Shaheen's mom who listens to the podcast.
[08:58.640 --> 09:00.380]  Hey, I just I wanted to share that.
[09:00.380 --> 09:01.660]  That brought me so much joy.
[09:02.060 --> 09:02.860]  Six people.
[09:03.180 --> 09:04.200]  There's videos for it.
[09:04.260 --> 09:04.760]  You can watch it.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.160]  Then you're just blank.
[09:06.700 --> 09:08.160]  That have no concept.
[09:08.360 --> 09:11.980]  I love the idea that he just deliberately died in front of five other people.
[09:12.180 --> 09:13.760]  Oh, really? Faced himself on that one.
[09:13.760 --> 09:15.140]  He absolutely did.
[09:15.240 --> 09:17.520]  He ate so much shit just because it was funny.
[09:18.040 --> 09:18.780]  I reached out immediately.
[09:18.920 --> 09:20.060]  I was like, oh, I appreciate it so much.
[09:20.580 --> 09:22.540]  And they're like, he's he's into eating pencils.
[09:22.700 --> 09:24.620]  And then he's like, no, not him.
[09:25.380 --> 09:29.920]  There needs to be a term or like a position of exaltation
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.080]  for someone who publicly faces themselves in such a way.
[09:33.180 --> 09:34.000]  You know? Oh, man.
[09:34.740 --> 09:36.320]  But yeah, I just wanted to share that.
[09:36.400 --> 09:37.680]  Check that out there.
[09:37.800 --> 09:40.360]  They do great reality coverage and that video, especially
[09:40.360 --> 09:44.000]  just seeing the blank faces of six other people.
[09:44.140 --> 09:45.680]  It's so good. It's great.
[09:46.160 --> 09:47.520]  I'm taking a bite of this dilly.
[09:47.720 --> 09:49.140]  What's it called? Dilly bar.
[09:49.340 --> 09:50.640]  Dilly. You're going to hate it, Gavin.
[09:50.760 --> 09:52.260]  It's on the wrapper in front of you.
[09:52.780 --> 09:53.360]  No, it's good.
[09:53.680 --> 09:54.220]  No, it's delicious.
[09:54.700 --> 09:57.760]  It's maybe the most inefficient shape for a stick.
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.560]  What? What do you mean?
[10:00.720 --> 10:01.780]  Oh, it's round.
[10:04.100 --> 10:05.260]  Oh, it's not bad.
[10:05.920 --> 10:06.920]  Oh, you don't mind it?
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.760]  I thought you'd be a lot pickier about the chocolate.
[10:10.280 --> 10:11.600]  It's fine. It's delicious.
[10:11.720 --> 10:12.680]  It's a pretty budget chocolate.
[10:13.120 --> 10:14.000]  One bite is enough for that one.
[10:15.900 --> 10:17.820]  It's like the one that Eric posted in the chat.
[10:17.900 --> 10:18.600]  That's Gavin's.
[10:18.920 --> 10:22.940]  I don't know if I don't know if your bribe worked on Gavin Andrew.
[10:23.440 --> 10:25.280]  Oh, I wouldn't expect it to work.
[10:25.360 --> 10:26.540]  I mean, I wanted to bribe Gavin.
[10:26.540 --> 10:29.940]  I'd send him like pickled fucking gopher feet or something.
[10:30.020 --> 10:31.640]  Some weird...
[10:31.640 --> 10:32.220]  You send him what?
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.600]  Pickled gopher feet?
[10:35.300 --> 10:36.760]  Yeah, it's a it's a delicacy in the UK.
[10:37.160 --> 10:40.140]  And yeah, I'm just my point was like a weird food.
[10:40.360 --> 10:42.840]  I don't really like anything pickled apart from pickle.
[10:43.180 --> 10:45.260]  But Branst, you're a Branston pickle guy.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.760]  Yeah, that's pickled.
[10:46.860 --> 10:48.460]  That's pickled, is it not?
[10:48.660 --> 10:49.320]  It's in the name.
[10:49.660 --> 10:51.400]  Is it really pickled, though, or is it pickle?
[10:51.680 --> 10:53.240]  Isn't it pickles that are pickled?
[10:54.040 --> 10:55.960]  I think there's some pickle and onion pickled.
[10:56.200 --> 10:57.480]  There's some pickled pickle and what?
[10:57.780 --> 11:01.880]  There's some you don't like present tense pickle, only past tense pickle.
[11:02.060 --> 11:03.900]  I think I just like the paste format.
[11:04.160 --> 11:07.540]  And when you have a pickle, it's not paste.
[11:07.980 --> 11:10.980]  I would actually maybe argue it's even more pickled than the average pickle
[11:10.980 --> 11:12.700]  because it's multiply multiple.
[11:12.920 --> 11:14.020]  No, I'm done.
[11:14.300 --> 11:15.280]  I lost that argument.
[11:15.480 --> 11:15.920]  Never mind.
[11:16.260 --> 11:17.180]  We're going home.
[11:18.580 --> 11:19.500]  That was bad.
[11:19.880 --> 11:21.200]  We just can't talk about this.
[11:21.620 --> 11:22.180]  No, we can't.
[11:22.180 --> 11:25.200]  I was going to say that there's multiple pickled items in one thing,
[11:25.580 --> 11:27.360]  like it's only pickled items, is it not?
[11:27.620 --> 11:30.880]  Yeah, I think it's like the cucumber and it's the the onion.
[11:31.460 --> 11:33.840]  I think we read off the ingredients once.
[11:34.000 --> 11:34.880]  It's like a pickle sector.
[11:35.400 --> 11:40.700]  But the actual pickle paste is maybe 10 to 15 times better than a pickle cucumber.
[11:41.140 --> 11:44.340]  I think if you were to pull the audience and said, like, one of these things
[11:44.340 --> 11:48.320]  is a lie about Gavin and they didn't have context and you listed
[11:48.320 --> 11:51.400]  he doesn't like pickled things, nobody's picking that.
[11:52.180 --> 11:56.360]  I think universally you're viewed as a pickled guy for the Branson Pickle.
[11:56.420 --> 11:56.800]  I'm shocked.
[11:57.780 --> 12:01.300]  Hey, Andrew, despite your troubles with Gavin, just so we're clear
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.140]  before going into Mario Party March.
[12:05.400 --> 12:07.620]  Yeah. Your bribe has worked on me.
[12:08.220 --> 12:13.760]  I will I am now in some form of debt to you in some way.
[12:13.760 --> 12:18.020]  And I will I will adhere to the constructs of a bribe.
[12:18.220 --> 12:20.900]  However, I will say as someone who is open to bribes,
[12:21.400 --> 12:28.100]  if anyone wants to bribe me on top of that to unbribe your bribe, I'm I'm available.
[12:28.360 --> 12:31.060]  So I'm yours until somebody gives me a better deal.
[12:31.140 --> 12:33.320]  How about that? I'm OK with that.
[12:33.720 --> 12:35.560]  How about I'll give you the best gift you've ever had
[12:35.560 --> 12:37.200]  if you don't screw me through the game?
[12:37.440 --> 12:41.560]  I must say, I'm like a bird in the hands or two in the bush kind of guy.
[12:42.220 --> 12:43.980]  Yeah. But what if there's five in the bush?
[12:44.580 --> 12:45.860]  I don't see. I can't see.
[12:45.900 --> 12:46.900]  I don't send him a box.
[12:46.980 --> 12:48.700]  The bush doesn't exist to me, dude.
[12:49.260 --> 12:51.580]  Geoff, I'm going to take you for hot dogs and coffee.
[12:51.820 --> 12:53.160]  I like the sound of that.
[12:53.540 --> 12:54.460]  That's a lot.
[12:55.060 --> 12:56.960]  That's coffee and hot dogs in the bush.
[12:57.100 --> 12:57.780]  You haven't got them yet.
[12:58.040 --> 12:59.840]  I haven't done anything for him yet.
[13:00.100 --> 13:04.800]  Yeah. But once he delivers on hot dogs and coffee, then we'll see.
[13:05.300 --> 13:08.580]  What if? Until as of right now, I'm Andrew's man right now.
[13:08.980 --> 13:09.840]  OK, what about this?
[13:10.220 --> 13:13.660]  If bribes are allowed throughout the game, are psych outs allowed?
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.800]  Yes. Oh, yeah, of course.
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.720]  What are psych outs? What do you mean?
[13:18.120 --> 13:19.040]  It's like you out.
[13:19.180 --> 13:20.060]  What does that mean?
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.620]  I don't know. Hey, you know what?
[13:23.720 --> 13:24.360]  I think it's working.
[13:26.060 --> 13:27.380]  I'm on tilt right now, Gavin.
[13:27.480 --> 13:28.700]  Can you un-psych me, please?
[13:30.720 --> 13:32.100]  Game hasn't even started yet.
[13:32.140 --> 13:33.400]  I shouldn't be psyched out like this.
[13:33.560 --> 13:35.420]  That was such a do billboards work.
[13:35.500 --> 13:36.600]  They just did moment.
[13:38.760 --> 13:41.300]  Yeah, like maybe there's some, you know, real world things
[13:41.300 --> 13:44.240]  that can happen throughout the game to try and throw you a little bit.
[13:44.320 --> 13:46.000]  Is he going to light my house on fire?
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.160]  No, that's an escalation.
[13:48.620 --> 13:50.620]  It is. I mean, it would disrupt the game.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.160]  Maybe they'll just be a game within the game that I'm playing.
[13:53.820 --> 13:56.560]  Maybe there'll be a marching band practicing outside of your bedroom window
[13:56.560 --> 13:57.380]  while we record.
[13:59.260 --> 14:00.640]  That'd be so hard to arrange.
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.560]  I'd open my door and say, hey, can you guys can you guys bring up a bed frame?
[14:07.680 --> 14:09.280]  I got a bed frame down here.
[14:09.640 --> 14:11.000]  There's like 16 of you.
[14:11.040 --> 14:11.820]  I think we could do this.
[14:12.340 --> 14:13.500]  Have you moved the bed frame yet?
[14:13.780 --> 14:15.100]  Not yet, but I've moved other things.
[14:15.100 --> 14:16.780]  Chair's gone. Got rid of all the chairs.
[14:17.060 --> 14:18.440]  Whoa. Wow.
[14:18.600 --> 14:19.820]  So you got some space again?
[14:20.440 --> 14:22.060]  I got some space. I'm reorganizing.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.160]  You know what I realized?
[14:23.220 --> 14:25.060]  And I didn't plan on talking about this on the show,
[14:25.140 --> 14:30.660]  but it is so difficult to buy a travel bag for old consoles.
[14:31.400 --> 14:32.560]  It's just not accessible.
[14:32.860 --> 14:34.640]  You just can't get them anywhere.
[14:35.160 --> 14:36.760]  eBay. I looked at eBay.
[14:36.900 --> 14:38.020]  OK, here's that.
[14:38.060 --> 14:39.560]  That transitions to a different thing.
[14:39.740 --> 14:43.520]  I can't find them on eBay, but they're shipping.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.660]  I looked at three bags.
[14:45.840 --> 14:51.420]  I was looking at an N64 one, a Wii U one and an original Xbox travel bag.
[14:52.400 --> 14:54.260]  Combined, it costs like $110.
[14:54.980 --> 14:56.740]  The shipping was $150.
[14:57.360 --> 14:58.940]  I was like, I can't do it. I just can't.
[14:59.480 --> 15:00.380]  I can't do it.
[15:00.600 --> 15:02.020]  Is it from outside of Canada?
[15:02.460 --> 15:05.380]  I think one of them was within Canada, but even within Canada,
[15:05.420 --> 15:08.480]  the shipping on eBay is very high, generally speaking.
[15:09.160 --> 15:10.660]  But I had a thought where it's like,
[15:11.360 --> 15:14.420]  I'm not going to say that like this chain, I'm always going to be mad
[15:14.980 --> 15:16.260]  about shipping things.
[15:16.560 --> 15:21.120]  But I thought for the first time, the premise of what if I had to go to the item
[15:21.120 --> 15:23.480]  instead of the item doing the journey to me?
[15:23.680 --> 15:28.600]  The premise that I could go to like two different states
[15:29.780 --> 15:32.140]  for $150 worth of fuel.
[15:32.880 --> 15:34.360]  Insane. What a value.
[15:35.600 --> 15:39.020]  But it going the other way, way too much insane.
[15:39.020 --> 15:40.120]  How is that good value?
[15:40.680 --> 15:44.400]  I you don't you think that you could like if you were to go on a road trip,
[15:44.460 --> 15:47.160]  you would spend more money on gas driving.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.160]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[15:48.480 --> 15:51.280]  Like I'm saying the fuel, like if you had to make the trip,
[15:51.380 --> 15:54.420]  the actual cost of the transport for yourself
[15:54.420 --> 15:57.360]  is more than what the item is paying.
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.560]  And you have to go and do it and waste all of that time.
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.220]  That's true. Yeah.
[16:02.220 --> 16:03.700]  I'm not I'm not advocate.
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.060]  I know there's all just purely on the premise of travel, though.
[16:07.580 --> 16:08.580]  I just thought that was interesting.
[16:08.580 --> 16:12.840]  Like if somebody said, hey, here's tickets to this place
[16:12.840 --> 16:16.200]  in the United States for $50, I would.
[16:16.400 --> 16:17.240]  That's a great value.
[16:17.280 --> 16:21.560]  But if I'm buying a $20 item attached to it and I'm paying 50 for the travel part,
[16:21.580 --> 16:23.000]  it's like this is the worst deal ever.
[16:23.640 --> 16:25.540]  Why? Why do you want to put all your consoles in bags?
[16:25.840 --> 16:29.460]  Because they're all in like grocery bags right now
[16:30.300 --> 16:31.240]  in my closet.
[16:31.240 --> 16:34.640]  And I was trying to like properly I'm trying to organize my closet better.
[16:34.640 --> 16:39.240]  And I thought I just having like a nice console bag would really solve these problems.
[16:39.540 --> 16:41.180]  So I thought, I'll just buy a few.
[16:41.280 --> 16:45.420]  And it just it's not there's not like a company that just specializes in that.
[16:45.500 --> 16:48.960]  From what I could see outside of whatever the current generation of console is.
[16:49.120 --> 16:52.600]  And it feels like a waste to buy one for a current gen console
[16:52.600 --> 16:54.560]  because then I just have an empty bag.
[16:54.560 --> 16:57.460]  But in like seven years, I guess it would be useful.
[16:57.460 --> 16:59.840]  But like, is that am I losing at that point?
[16:59.880 --> 17:02.020]  It feels like a waste to keep a console in a bag.
[17:02.020 --> 17:06.180]  Well, I just I don't have space to plug in some of the stuff like the N64.
[17:06.280 --> 17:08.760]  And I have an original Xbox that like.
[17:08.980 --> 17:10.280]  Couldn't you just put it on a shelf?
[17:10.700 --> 17:12.900]  Like build shelves in your closet?
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.500]  Uh, what about the wall?
[17:16.320 --> 17:17.560]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. What do you mean?
[17:18.360 --> 17:19.460]  Put a console on the wall.
[17:20.160 --> 17:21.000]  How would I do that?
[17:21.640 --> 17:22.920]  Hang it. Screws.
[17:25.080 --> 17:27.460]  A little display wall of all your shit?
[17:27.980 --> 17:28.920]  Yeah, I don't.
[17:28.920 --> 17:31.220]  Remember back how like Jeremy had all of his Xbox
[17:32.160 --> 17:34.360]  one controllers on the wall or 360 controllers on the wall?
[17:34.480 --> 17:35.880]  Kind of like that. Yeah, I got some of those.
[17:36.140 --> 17:36.960]  But like Gavin has his.
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.540]  He doesn't talk about it, but his dildo wall.
[17:40.540 --> 17:41.840]  Oh, I've heard about the dildo wall.
[17:42.240 --> 17:44.100]  Yeah. Oh, what if it?
[17:44.180 --> 17:47.120]  Oh, would that would they be would they be slung on like a little hook
[17:47.120 --> 17:50.700]  or would they be poking through the wall like 18 glory holes with dildos going up?
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.480]  Well, the ones at like a higher elevation are just set and nestled to like the side.
[17:55.560 --> 17:57.360]  But the ones that are lower that you feel like using,
[17:57.360 --> 17:59.180]  those are just protruded outwards.
[17:59.300 --> 18:03.200]  So it's just like kind of a grab and go situation or use it right there on the wall.
[18:03.920 --> 18:06.300]  Do you think dildos got bigger with time?
[18:07.260 --> 18:08.240]  Dildos got bigger with time.
[18:08.360 --> 18:10.020]  Like, well, like people got taller over time.
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.060]  No. Like, do you think that like the expectation changed over time?
[18:14.480 --> 18:15.620]  Oh, like the first dildo.
[18:15.860 --> 18:18.020]  Like the first dildos were like kind of like modest.
[18:18.180 --> 18:19.760]  Yeah. And then as time progressed, like.
[18:19.940 --> 18:22.540]  I mean, you can go back and look at dildos
[18:22.540 --> 18:26.120]  they've dug up that are like 5000 years old and see for yourself.
[18:26.800 --> 18:30.280]  There's some there's some there's some honkers out there from the olden days.
[18:30.620 --> 18:34.520]  I'd like to think that they're like noses or ears or they're progressively growing.
[18:34.860 --> 18:38.920]  I think a dildo culture is always slightly getting bigger.
[18:39.200 --> 18:41.420]  I don't know how they know it's a dildo though.
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.320]  Like, surely, wouldn't stuff become dildo over time?
[18:46.980 --> 18:47.980]  I don't understand.
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.120]  Wouldn't a bunch of stuff eventually erode down to just like a cylinder of stone
[18:52.120 --> 18:52.420]  or something?
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.400]  And they're like, oh, it's a dildo.
[18:54.740 --> 19:00.000]  What if it was a what if it was a rolling pin or like what if it was some sort of tool?
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.580]  Do you think people are incorrectly declaring dildos that aren't dildos?
[19:02.840 --> 19:05.920]  Yeah, I think a lot of stuff looks like a dildo at the end.
[19:07.540 --> 19:08.180]  Really? Interesting.
[19:09.400 --> 19:11.380]  I'm trying to think of what like what do you think?
[19:11.960 --> 19:12.680]  Like a club?
[19:13.180 --> 19:15.240]  Oh, a chair leg or something. I don't know, like everything.
[19:17.520 --> 19:18.260]  Like, how do they?
[19:18.320 --> 19:19.240]  How do they? Your collection.
[19:19.640 --> 19:21.240]  Your collection is fucking weird, dude.
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.600]  Yeah. My point is, how do they know something from 5000 years ago
[19:24.600 --> 19:25.780]  was a dildo original?
[19:25.800 --> 19:29.200]  Kevin must think that I have so many dildos left over from these chairs
[19:29.200 --> 19:35.180]  that I'm breaking DNA, DNA on it, DNA on the dildo.
[19:35.940 --> 19:37.180]  Well, how do they know, Geoff?
[19:37.440 --> 19:40.600]  Do you think it's called a dildo because the inventor was named dildo?
[19:40.660 --> 19:41.860]  That feels like a name.
[19:42.300 --> 19:45.680]  I've never thought about this, I think, because of images like this.
[19:46.920 --> 19:50.420]  An old fresco where somebody is holding a dildo in their hand
[19:50.420 --> 19:53.380]  and they're taking it out of a bag for a box full of dildos.
[19:53.560 --> 19:55.080]  No, I'm not. No, no, no.
[19:55.140 --> 19:57.180]  You wouldn't store them like that, right, Gavin?
[19:57.580 --> 19:59.500]  Once again, though, what are you saying?
[19:59.720 --> 20:01.120]  It's a bucket of dildos.
[20:01.800 --> 20:05.820]  Or how about this old dildo that they found that looks like somebody carved it
[20:05.820 --> 20:07.180]  with a dickhead at the end of it?
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.320]  That could be like a pestle and mortar situation.
[20:09.480 --> 20:10.780]  These are scientists.
[20:11.460 --> 20:12.900]  I wasn't on Gavin's side.
[20:13.040 --> 20:15.180]  I think the second one does look like a chair leg.
[20:15.540 --> 20:18.400]  And the first one could simply be a man
[20:18.400 --> 20:22.540]  holding a candle trying to figure out what's in his fruit basket.
[20:22.800 --> 20:25.460]  It's a man stepping into a shoehorn bucket
[20:25.460 --> 20:28.180]  because that's where he puts on his shoes and he's using his shoehorns.
[20:28.340 --> 20:32.940]  Our knowledge of dildos isn't just limited to amusing archaeological finds.
[20:33.100 --> 20:36.100]  We even see evidence of dildos in a range of art and literature
[20:36.100 --> 20:38.420]  from the ancient world, like the Bible.
[20:39.320 --> 20:41.820]  Oh, wow. There's a chapter on dildos.
[20:41.940 --> 20:44.040]  They described the dimensions of a dildo.
[20:44.240 --> 20:47.960]  However, the first literary appearance of the dildo may well outdate
[20:47.960 --> 20:49.020]  even ancient Greece.
[20:49.180 --> 20:52.000]  In fact, the first literary reference to dildos is believed to take place
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.180]  in the Old Testament in Ezekiel 16, 17.
[20:54.660 --> 20:58.480]  God reprimands the people of Jerusalem because they took the gold and silver
[20:58.480 --> 21:02.160]  that he has given them and made phallic images and fornicated with them.
[21:05.100 --> 21:11.940]  According to a video by Dan McClellan, theologian and scripture translator,
[21:12.060 --> 21:15.400]  the original verb used to describe fornification is zanah,
[21:15.400 --> 21:19.920]  which is often used as a metaphorical sense in the Hebrew Bible to refer
[21:19.920 --> 21:23.760]  to worshiping other deities symbol symbolically committing adultery
[21:23.760 --> 21:26.000]  against God and Israel.
[21:27.160 --> 21:31.380]  So while it could be seen as metaphorical fornication with phallic images,
[21:31.520 --> 21:35.140]  he states that it's also very plausible that this could and should be
[21:35.140 --> 21:36.060]  interpreted literally.
[21:36.600 --> 21:39.080]  Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't doubt that dildos were around,
[21:39.140 --> 21:41.600]  that it was one of the first things invented probably by man.
[21:41.620 --> 21:43.420]  But I'm just not sure how they know
[21:43.420 --> 21:45.720]  the physical objects are the dildos.
[21:45.860 --> 21:49.500]  Well, how do you know a bowl is a bowl and not a shitting container?
[21:49.820 --> 21:52.560]  You know, exactly my point. Yeah. Hmm.
[21:53.840 --> 21:55.920]  Hmm. What's the oldest dildo you have, Gavin?
[21:57.940 --> 21:59.560]  It's the one at the top of the wall.
[22:00.440 --> 22:02.360]  You climb it like it's a romper room.
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.520]  Like, like your cliffhanger, you're shoving dildos into the wall to go higher.
[22:10.920 --> 22:13.060]  Oh, we talked about that clip, haven't we?
[22:13.100 --> 22:16.700]  Where the guy throws the dildo and it goes down the guy's throat.
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.320]  No, dude, I just caught a passage.
[22:20.440 --> 22:21.800]  I was about to close the dildo page.
[22:22.460 --> 22:26.560]  Hallie Lieberman's research indicates that double ended dildos have a history
[22:26.560 --> 22:30.040]  that extends back at least 13,000 to 19,000 years.
[22:30.800 --> 22:32.440]  Dang, that's crazy.
[22:32.820 --> 22:34.580]  People were freaks back then. I love it.
[22:36.240 --> 22:40.440]  Do you find yourself ordering takeout more than actually cooking at home?
[22:40.840 --> 22:43.660]  That's a trap that my wife and I have fallen into now that the kid is off
[22:43.660 --> 22:46.040]  of college and we have less mouths to feed.
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.100]  But instead of ordering out, instead of paying for delivery fees,
[22:50.460 --> 22:52.580]  why not do what we did and try factor?
[22:52.920 --> 22:56.500]  That's right. I ate loaded bacon and spinach shredded chicken.
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.500]  I've eaten honey mustard chicken.
[22:58.680 --> 22:59.740]  I eat a lot of chicken, by the way.
[22:59.780 --> 23:01.120]  I don't know if this is coming across.
[23:01.120 --> 23:05.360]  We had paprika beef and pepper goulash macaroni.
[23:05.740 --> 23:08.820]  And my wife's favorite, I think, four cheese tortellini
[23:08.820 --> 23:12.800]  and Italian sausage pizzaiola, however you say that.
[23:13.080 --> 23:15.260]  And each meal is honestly delicious.

[24:29.080 --> 24:30.180]  People are freaks now.
[24:30.280 --> 24:34.300]  I have something to share a wonderful creation.
[24:34.700 --> 24:35.780]  I don't know if you guys have seen
[24:36.860 --> 24:40.780]  ever since we talked about the GERPLID, people have been going out there
[24:40.780 --> 24:42.940]  and making their own solutions to the problem.
[24:43.940 --> 24:48.340]  And I got sent one today by a member of our community named Matthew Frank.
[24:48.840 --> 24:51.260]  And I really appreciate his ingenuity.
[24:51.900 --> 24:56.400]  I'm posting a video clip in our discord channel right now.
[24:56.500 --> 25:00.580]  Gavin, I think you'll especially appreciate this design.
[25:01.100 --> 25:03.660]  OK, it is uploading.
[25:03.720 --> 25:04.300]  It's almost done.
[25:04.680 --> 25:08.020]  So as you can see, it is a GERPLID with a blue top on it
[25:08.020 --> 25:09.960]  and it has a pair of balls.
[25:10.380 --> 25:12.160]  What on the top? What?
[25:12.520 --> 25:16.460]  And Geoff, now, how do you know they're balls?
[25:17.180 --> 25:18.320]  That's a great point, Geoff.
[25:18.780 --> 25:21.240]  Now, see, he's explaining how it works.
[25:21.240 --> 25:23.400]  So you can knuckle the balls.
[25:23.500 --> 25:25.400]  He's calls it the unregulation knuckler.
[25:25.540 --> 25:28.740]  You knuckle them and it closes the little gap.
[25:29.380 --> 25:32.160]  So if you want to stop some drippage. Wow.
[25:33.180 --> 25:34.720]  You got it taken care of.
[25:35.300 --> 25:36.600]  That is brilliant.
[25:37.380 --> 25:39.920]  I yeah, I was blown away by the design.
[25:41.280 --> 25:42.520]  Thank you very much to them.
[25:43.080 --> 25:45.060]  I've loved seeing all these people's creations.
[25:45.240 --> 25:45.440]  They're great.
[25:45.500 --> 25:48.060]  I'm so glad you brought that up because I was going to talk about a few as well.
[25:48.120 --> 25:50.840]  There's the guy that made the the GERPLID silencer.
[25:51.240 --> 25:53.180]  Which is kind of like a rubber bands around it.
[25:53.220 --> 25:54.560]  So if it falls, it's quiet.
[25:54.780 --> 25:56.760]  There's an all the people that are saying that you can like
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.780]  apparently large McDonald's lids fit very well on a GERPLID.
[26:01.680 --> 26:03.440]  They're saying, yeah, apparently they work really well.
[26:03.760 --> 26:06.800]  There's been a bunch of like GERPLID accoutrements
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.880]  over since the last episode that have been really fantastic to watch
[26:09.880 --> 26:10.480]  and find out about.
[26:10.980 --> 26:12.580]  This is by far the best.
[26:13.160 --> 26:14.220]  Would you drink out of that, Gavin?
[26:16.140 --> 26:17.140]  Well, I don't know.
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.100]  I don't know if like 3D print is safe to put your mouth on.
[26:20.100 --> 26:22.620]  But if it was done properly, I would definitely drink out of that.
[26:23.040 --> 26:23.380]  Interesting.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.840]  I never thought about the 3D printing safety thing.
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.680]  I assume it's not food safe, but as a concept, incredible.
[26:30.140 --> 26:34.300]  He would much rather blindly trust the plastic or silicone mold
[26:34.300 --> 26:37.160]  that comes from a factory that none of us will ever go to.
[26:41.140 --> 26:42.320]  You want to get gross, Geoff?
[26:42.360 --> 26:43.500]  I want to make sure you have tons of time.
[26:43.560 --> 26:45.080]  I feel good now. I feel ready. I'm locked in.
[26:45.140 --> 26:46.700]  Oh, yeah, I'm down to get gross.
[26:46.780 --> 26:48.020]  But Gavin, you had a clip, too.
[26:48.060 --> 26:49.780]  You said we started late because of your clip.
[26:49.780 --> 26:50.860]  Did you want to do that?
[26:51.140 --> 26:52.760]  Uh, well, yeah, I could play the clip for sure.
[26:53.140 --> 26:53.700]  I'd hope so.
[26:54.040 --> 26:56.560]  Well, let somebody know if you wouldn't mind.
[26:56.640 --> 26:57.460]  We'd appreciate it.
[26:57.500 --> 27:00.600]  And we'll be here next week saying the same dumb shit.
[27:00.720 --> 27:02.940]  I imagine Gavin's balls will come up at some point.
[27:03.340 --> 27:04.360]  So you don't want to miss that.
[27:04.540 --> 27:05.280]  Got some ball news.
[27:05.980 --> 27:06.560]  Oh, no.
[27:06.900 --> 27:07.220]  Oh!
[27:08.100 --> 27:10.880]  Now, this is a superpower that I've discovered I have now.
[27:11.140 --> 27:11.960]  Ever since...
[27:11.960 --> 27:12.680]  Oh, no.
[27:12.840 --> 27:17.940]  At some point last year, I had an MRI on my brain and they ejected some con...
[27:17.940 --> 27:18.420]  It wasn't an MRI.
[27:18.420 --> 27:20.060]  It was like a CT something.
[27:20.340 --> 27:26.680]  They had to eject some contrast into my brain so they could see the veins in it, I guess.
[27:27.060 --> 27:27.700]  That's crazy.
[27:28.060 --> 27:31.340]  And as they were ejecting it, the woman said,
[27:32.100 --> 27:36.380]  you might you might feel some some heat in your cheeks and your hands.
[27:36.860 --> 27:37.900]  I was like, oh, all right.
[27:38.680 --> 27:41.120]  And she she put the needle in and gave it a squeeze.
[27:42.640 --> 27:43.980]  Straight into my balls.
[27:44.140 --> 27:48.400]  I felt the heat immediately as she plunged it in my testicles.
[27:48.400 --> 27:54.800]  And ever since that, I have a new superpower where temperature is detected in my balls
[27:54.800 --> 28:00.860]  like second, like if Meg has cold hands and she touches my arm, my balls go cold.
[28:03.500 --> 28:08.860]  And I don't know why or like what the science of that is, but I could feel like if
[28:08.860 --> 28:13.260]  if I was trying to test like baby milk temperature,
[28:13.480 --> 28:15.460]  I think I would have to squirt it on my ball.
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.880]  Or I would feel it in my balls, or if I was like elbowing the bathtub.
[28:21.800 --> 28:25.440]  I don't know how it happened, but there's now a link
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.840]  between my arms and my balls.
[28:29.480 --> 28:31.800]  Can we scientifically test this out?
[28:32.300 --> 28:34.580]  Can we get together and do some filming, please?
[28:34.620 --> 28:39.560]  I think it's time we you you don't like you could be fully covered yet.
[28:39.640 --> 28:44.180]  We just need something that like detects heat in a specific region.
[28:44.180 --> 28:46.820]  And we have to like have you feel ice.
[28:47.520 --> 28:49.020]  I want to see it.
[28:49.060 --> 28:52.140]  Maybe if we do temperature probes on the sack, I want to see if my balls
[28:52.140 --> 28:55.600]  are actually getting cold or whether it's just a phantom feeling.
[28:55.720 --> 29:00.140]  But I felt it in my hands and my cheeks, maybe 30 seconds after.
[29:00.460 --> 29:04.420]  And I felt it in my balls, maybe one second after she ejected it.
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.060]  So if Meg has cold hands, you get warm balls.
[29:08.320 --> 29:09.840]  Does it work the other way?
[29:10.980 --> 29:14.360]  If something touches you, that's really hot and your balls get cold.
[29:14.620 --> 29:15.120]  Like, is it a?
[29:15.480 --> 29:18.320]  No, I felt the cold in my balls when she touched my head.
[29:18.420 --> 29:21.480]  Do you feel the heat in your balls when you touch something hot like the stove?
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.780]  I don't know.
[29:23.420 --> 29:25.420]  She kind of touched the back of my arm like under,
[29:26.160 --> 29:27.920]  like I'd say in a bicep area.
[29:28.140 --> 29:29.920]  And I felt like maybe I should put something hot there.
[29:30.180 --> 29:32.140]  Well, let's don't do it till we can film it.
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.320]  OK, I was just wondering, did anyone else has anyone else had any like
[29:36.320 --> 29:39.340]  ball to rest of the body links that they didn't know were there?
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.800]  For heat? No, no.
[29:41.860 --> 29:42.820]  OK, for temperature.
[29:43.000 --> 29:44.460]  That's so interesting, though.
[29:44.900 --> 29:46.700]  Nick specifically said not for temperature.
[29:46.860 --> 29:49.240]  What have you felt my balls?
[29:49.340 --> 29:51.280]  His balls. His balls know when it's going to rain.
[29:51.740 --> 29:54.400]  Yeah. A ball-rometer.
[29:58.560 --> 30:00.400]  Raise themselves into the body.
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.600]  Yeah. Here comes the storm.
[30:03.340 --> 30:07.300]  So you feel a cold thing in your balls, let you know before anything else does.
[30:08.780 --> 30:10.440]  Am I understanding this correctly?
[30:11.220 --> 30:13.420]  No, I mean, I feel it in my balls next.
[30:13.700 --> 30:14.900]  Like I feel it in the original spot.
[30:15.100 --> 30:16.280]  It's the point of contact.
[30:16.540 --> 30:19.680]  And then it goes you get like a shiver in your balls.
[30:20.180 --> 30:21.960]  Yeah, but it's so fast.
[30:22.020 --> 30:25.140]  It's like the it's like maybe after one second.
[30:25.600 --> 30:26.660]  It's like spider sense.
[30:27.080 --> 30:30.320]  I can't tell whether it's like the speed of the nerves or whether
[30:30.860 --> 30:34.720]  the cold is getting into my blood and then my blood gets pumped.
[30:34.720 --> 30:37.300]  And I feel it when it hits my balls.
[30:37.480 --> 30:39.000]  But I don't know if blood is that fast.
[30:39.160 --> 30:41.820]  Now, did you ever notice it in your balls before?
[30:42.320 --> 30:43.460]  Ever? Like just generally?
[30:43.800 --> 30:47.140]  No, because I don't feel like I'm detecting heat or cold
[30:47.140 --> 30:49.800]  from my balls just in a general sense.
[30:50.260 --> 30:53.820]  If maybe if we got an ice cube and put it on my arm, that would be a good test.
[30:54.220 --> 30:57.660]  Yeah, this sounds like something to test in the next office day.
[30:57.780 --> 30:58.540]  Well, we should.
[30:58.700 --> 31:00.680]  I mean, I'm just kind of spitballing here.
[31:00.760 --> 31:03.580]  Feel free to kind of lead me down the right path.
[31:03.940 --> 31:06.920]  We put the ice cube on your arm
[31:06.920 --> 31:08.960]  and see how soon until you feel it in your balls.
[31:09.120 --> 31:11.040]  And then we let everything kind of like rewarm.
[31:11.320 --> 31:14.860]  And then we put the ice cube on your balls and see if it was faster or slower.
[31:15.540 --> 31:16.840]  Yeah. Yeah.
[31:17.020 --> 31:19.920]  You think touching it on my arm will be faster than touching on my balls?
[31:20.960 --> 31:23.680]  Gavin, I've I have no idea how your superpowers work.
[31:23.800 --> 31:25.740]  I'm trying to get to the bottom of this. That's all.
[31:25.840 --> 31:28.240]  Yeah. Yeah. This is what's called the scientific process, Gavin.
[31:28.700 --> 31:29.460]  You got to let it play out.
[31:29.560 --> 31:30.220]  We're scientists.
[31:31.060 --> 31:32.860]  Well, here's how I think we could do it.
[31:32.860 --> 31:36.640]  Well, we'll all get together on an office day and we'll have a stopwatch.
[31:37.100 --> 31:40.360]  We all put the ice cube on our arms and then you just stop the top
[31:40.360 --> 31:43.000]  the timer when you feel it in your balls, if ever.
[31:43.160 --> 31:44.760]  I love that. All right.
[31:44.800 --> 31:47.760]  I think that's one of the many cool experiments we're about to do on your balls.
[31:48.220 --> 31:51.600]  Yeah. And that is the end of my weekly ball news.
[31:51.980 --> 31:54.340]  Just very quickly, as we were talking about,
[31:54.460 --> 31:58.220]  and we're in the process of of looking for an office.
[31:58.620 --> 32:02.240]  I'm going to share this and I don't want you guys to reveal what it is.
[32:02.240 --> 32:05.440]  But I found something that I think we should all
[32:06.420 --> 32:07.380]  come together for.
[32:07.460 --> 32:10.340]  I think we could all agree that we should put our own money towards this
[32:11.000 --> 32:11.960]  for the office.
[32:12.780 --> 32:13.600]  Look at this.
[32:13.940 --> 32:14.640]  I just didn't.
[32:14.940 --> 32:17.000]  We can reveal at a later point what this is.
[32:17.560 --> 32:18.760]  Look at what I found is available.
[32:20.140 --> 32:20.940]  No way.
[32:21.940 --> 32:23.780]  Still loading. No way.
[32:24.360 --> 32:24.840]  It's not from the.
[32:25.400 --> 32:26.200]  No way.
[32:27.100 --> 32:28.100]  Edit that. I can't say.
[32:28.500 --> 32:29.340]  No. Can't say it.
[32:29.440 --> 32:30.920]  No. That was the whole thing you just said.
[32:30.920 --> 32:32.400]  Yeah, that was the whole point.
[32:32.600 --> 32:33.840]  Without saying what it was.
[32:34.720 --> 32:36.060]  You're going to just reveal it.
[32:36.420 --> 32:39.260]  OK, I can't believe I can't believe this is real.
[32:39.480 --> 32:41.280]  I cannot believe it was real either.
[32:41.880 --> 32:42.700]  We need it.
[32:43.260 --> 32:44.380]  They have a bunch of there's.
[32:44.560 --> 32:45.860]  Oh, dude, there's like a bunch of stuff.
[32:46.140 --> 32:48.560]  There's a few. Yeah, that's by far the best thing.
[32:49.600 --> 32:50.900]  But we need that.
[32:52.800 --> 32:55.000]  We can put Gavin's cold balls in it or something.
[32:55.080 --> 32:56.440]  I don't know, but we need it.
[32:57.740 --> 32:58.540]  No way.
[32:58.540 --> 33:00.060]  Isn't that crazy stuff?
[33:00.820 --> 33:02.180]  Yeah, I was really excited about it.
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.580]  But that is the coolest thing.
[33:03.800 --> 33:06.100]  It's also kind of affordable, too, you know?
[33:06.120 --> 33:08.160]  Yeah, I know. It's not insane.
[33:08.760 --> 33:09.120]  Absolutely.
[33:09.540 --> 33:13.160]  I bet if it goes for its lowest, you could even make profit just of the materials.
[33:13.560 --> 33:14.860]  Yeah, no, potentially.
[33:16.700 --> 33:19.760]  Wow. We'll reveal this at a later date of what the item was.
[33:19.940 --> 33:21.960]  But Gavin, you'll be the first one to use it, right?
[33:22.500 --> 33:23.080]  I guess so.
[33:24.360 --> 33:27.280]  And it's so funny that you had your ball, your ball update.
[33:27.280 --> 33:30.500]  And I realized looking at my notes, I have a small ball update, too.
[33:30.600 --> 33:31.260]  Oh, please.
[33:31.340 --> 33:35.300]  Do you think we should dedicate a little segment, you know, every month to like ball news?
[33:36.080 --> 33:38.500]  Maybe, but maybe not a bad idea.
[33:39.040 --> 33:39.520]  Ball news.
[33:40.200 --> 33:41.920]  I did something last night that I've never done before.
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.340]  And I while my wife was laughing at me about it, I
[33:46.860 --> 33:50.040]  I thought, I wonder if you guys have ever experienced this
[33:50.040 --> 33:53.380]  or if it's just me or if it's an age thing, or maybe I'm just incredibly limber.
[33:53.440 --> 33:54.860]  Maybe that's what it is. Maybe I'm just too flexible.
[33:54.860 --> 34:00.520]  But last night when I was putting my pajama pants on, putting my legs into my pajama pants,
[34:00.960 --> 34:03.540]  I take my pants off and then put my my jammy pants on.
[34:04.080 --> 34:08.640]  I somehow flamingo kicked my own balls with my right heel of my foot.
[34:08.840 --> 34:08.900]  What?
[34:09.340 --> 34:09.880]  Almost blacked out.
[34:11.960 --> 34:18.260]  Standing up, like pulling my pants off, I like slipped and my leg just went straight up
[34:18.260 --> 34:22.580]  and the heel of my right foot just smashed my right ball so hard.
[34:22.580 --> 34:26.160]  I saw black, like I lost my vision for a second.
[34:29.680 --> 34:32.740]  And I don't know if that means I'm in really good shape and really limber
[34:32.740 --> 34:35.340]  or if my balls are hanging down to my knees or whatever.
[34:35.740 --> 34:39.960]  But holy shit, I've never kicked my own balls before.
[34:40.400 --> 34:43.160]  Have you guys ever kicked yourself in the balls?
[34:43.460 --> 34:45.620]  Was it the back of your balls or the underside?
[34:46.160 --> 34:47.180]  No, it was like the bottom.
[34:47.460 --> 34:48.480]  It's like the whole right ball.
[34:48.660 --> 34:50.680]  I kicked the fucking the whole ball, man.
[34:50.680 --> 34:53.260]  My heel is as big of a ball as a bigger than my ball, man.
[34:53.460 --> 34:55.260]  Just smooshed it right up into me.
[34:55.720 --> 34:57.220]  I know I don't.
[34:57.340 --> 34:59.800]  I've never had that happen and I've never heard of anyone
[34:59.800 --> 35:01.660]  kicking themselves in the balls before.
[35:01.720 --> 35:03.740]  I've never had someone kick themselves in the nuts.
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.780]  Talk about a fucking superpower you wish you didn't have.
[35:08.260 --> 35:10.060]  Why? Why can people do that?
[35:11.080 --> 35:12.300]  Well, stupid evolution.
[35:12.660 --> 35:16.320]  I don't recommend they try to find out if it's something that they can or can't do.
[35:16.700 --> 35:20.660]  Just assume you can't and move along with your life and try to just be very careful.
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.820]  Just be very careful putting jammy pants on, apparently.
[35:23.460 --> 35:27.200]  I feel like I've nudged my balls with the heel, like if I sit cross-legged too fast,
[35:27.740 --> 35:29.520]  but I've never done it from like a stand.
[35:31.180 --> 35:33.540]  Geoff, when did you get these jammy pants?
[35:33.780 --> 35:34.900]  How new are these jammy pants?
[35:35.000 --> 35:35.640]  I got them for Christmas.
[35:36.380 --> 35:39.700]  OK, they're Detroit Tigers jammies that Bernie and Vanessa got me.
[35:40.000 --> 35:44.040]  I just feel like every story I hear relating to your jammy pants is disaster
[35:44.040 --> 35:47.240]  for you, and I was questioning if you needed to get rid of the jammy pants.
[35:47.360 --> 35:49.000]  If I'm in jammies, it's not good.
[35:49.560 --> 35:50.480]  That's a bad scene.
[35:50.680 --> 35:52.220]  It's the bad time of day for me.
[35:52.340 --> 35:54.820]  The the the sleep. You're knocking over sodas.
[35:54.940 --> 35:57.540]  You're kicking your own balls like these jammy pants.
[35:57.720 --> 35:59.220]  I think you got to evaluate.
[35:59.580 --> 36:01.300]  Midnight to about 5 a.m.
[36:01.320 --> 36:03.960]  is a dark time for me in a lot of ways.
[36:04.220 --> 36:07.780]  Dude, people were floored that you're drinking soda at night.
[36:07.820 --> 36:10.400]  I'm not! I'm not drinking soda at night!
[36:10.420 --> 36:11.460]  But Bernie said it was there from the morning.
[36:11.740 --> 36:14.720]  I had a monster energy drink at eight in the fucking morning
[36:14.720 --> 36:17.500]  that I had drank five sips of, and I set it down.
[36:17.500 --> 36:20.700]  And then I went about my entire day, forgot that it even existed.
[36:20.920 --> 36:22.940]  And then at two in the morning or whatever, when I get up to pee,
[36:23.120 --> 36:26.480]  I walked by it and I saw liquid and I thought, oh, my mouth is dry.
[36:26.780 --> 36:28.360]  I'll just take a sip of that.
[36:28.440 --> 36:31.280]  It's not like I was going to drink enough to get a fucking to wake.
[36:31.520 --> 36:34.220]  Zoom! I'm awake! I had one ounce of fucking caffeine.
[36:34.380 --> 36:35.320]  Now I'm bouncing off the walls.
[36:35.500 --> 36:36.540]  It was nothing like that.
[36:36.760 --> 36:38.480]  And it was it was a sugar free one, too, by the way.
[36:38.500 --> 36:39.760]  It wasn't a sugary drink.
[36:39.920 --> 36:41.920]  It was just something to wet my mouth.
[36:42.340 --> 36:43.520]  That's fair. Yeah.
[36:43.980 --> 36:46.620]  I don't keep I don't even keep drinks by.
[36:46.620 --> 36:49.920]  It was that's what the thing that was crazy is that I had a drink by my bed
[36:49.920 --> 36:52.340]  three out of four nights that never happens.
[36:52.460 --> 36:53.720]  I don't ever have that.
[36:53.900 --> 36:56.820]  Emily keeps what she calls her baba by her bed,
[36:56.880 --> 37:00.620]  which is like a eight hundred and sixty four ounce Stanley cup
[37:00.620 --> 37:05.600]  with like a backpack on it and a fucking I don't know, like a docking station
[37:05.600 --> 37:08.500]  and all the different things that you can put on one of those drinks.
[37:08.580 --> 37:11.080]  It's got like fucking it's got Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[37:11.440 --> 37:14.220]  And if I ever get thirsty at night, I usually just say, like,
[37:14.220 --> 37:16.060]  can I have a drink of your baba and then she'll let me drink it.
[37:16.060 --> 37:17.580]  But it just so rarely happens.
[37:17.720 --> 37:19.940]  And she was dead ass asleep all three times, so I didn't bother.
[37:20.780 --> 37:21.960]  Oh, that's so funny.
[37:22.140 --> 37:25.080]  Like she's wearing a camel back to bed just in case.
[37:25.100 --> 37:26.980]  Like this immediate drinkage.
[37:27.420 --> 37:30.800]  I actually try not to drink past like nine or 10 p.m.
[37:30.800 --> 37:32.860]  in general, whether it's water or anything else,
[37:32.860 --> 37:34.120]  because I don't want to be up pissing all night.
[37:34.180 --> 37:37.420]  It's just like saying if I'm going to be up till two in the morning
[37:37.420 --> 37:40.380]  playing with the truck boys, maybe I'll bring a drink into it.
[37:40.380 --> 37:41.400]  Like I was going to do that one night.
[37:41.440 --> 37:44.860]  But yeah, it's not drinking monsters every night at three in the morning.
[37:44.860 --> 37:48.920]  God, did you when you healed your balls, Geoff, did you notice any drippage?
[37:48.920 --> 37:51.680]  No, no, they were they were tight, tight and dry.
[37:51.780 --> 37:54.600]  Yeah. No, I bet if you just pissed there, there might have been a jet.
[37:55.900 --> 37:57.020]  Oh, 100 percent.
[37:57.160 --> 37:59.060]  I 100 percent if I had just pissed, there would have been.
[37:59.160 --> 38:01.920]  And speaking of piss, this is a great opportunity for me
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.440]  to catch you guys up on where I've been in my life.
[38:06.040 --> 38:07.780]  What's been going on in my deal? Please.
[38:09.020 --> 38:11.340]  Over the weekend, I went down to
[38:11.340 --> 38:15.780]  a Emily Burndog and Vanessa and I, we all went down to Disneyland
[38:15.780 --> 38:18.300]  to celebrate Vanessa's birthday and Emily's birthday.
[38:19.120 --> 38:21.520]  And so we were there from Thursday to Sunday.
[38:21.720 --> 38:24.960]  Had a lovely time on Friday.
[38:25.340 --> 38:28.940]  Emily, we just did a thing, you know, because none of us drink or anything.
[38:28.940 --> 38:30.900]  Right. So not that you could in Disneyland anyway,
[38:30.960 --> 38:32.580]  but I guess you could at California Adventure.
[38:32.900 --> 38:35.220]  But, you know, none of us are like partiers. Right.
[38:35.260 --> 38:36.700]  So we're walking around Disneyland.
[38:36.860 --> 38:37.500]  You want to treat yourself.
[38:37.580 --> 38:38.680]  You're like, oh, they have cotton candy.
[38:38.680 --> 38:42.380]  And so Emily was like a kid and going like, oh, I want to get a little bit of this.
[38:42.480 --> 38:43.940]  I want a little bit of that, you know, a little bit.
[38:44.000 --> 38:44.580]  I want to have some of that.
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.480]  And on Friday, we had ate a lot of just dog shit by the end of the day.
[38:48.520 --> 38:50.180]  And I was like, man, I got to take it easy tomorrow.
[38:50.580 --> 38:55.940]  At about two in the morning that night, Emily woke up and proceeded to vomit
[38:57.240 --> 38:58.340]  more than I've ever.
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.360]  And I say this without hyperbole, more than I've ever heard a human being
[39:01.360 --> 39:02.760]  vomit in my entire life.
[39:02.900 --> 39:07.000]  Like she could have filled up like like four of the buckets in the Bozo
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.480]  the Clown Ping Pong Bucket Challenge.
[39:09.740 --> 39:10.920]  Like it was insane.
[39:11.220 --> 39:13.280]  And I helped her get cleaned up and everything.
[39:13.400 --> 39:13.660]  And she was fine.
[39:13.740 --> 39:16.500]  She's had a sick tummy from probably riding rides and eating all the candy.
[39:16.680 --> 39:17.660]  And so she went back to bed.
[39:17.760 --> 39:19.160]  She's totally fine.
[39:19.960 --> 39:20.440]  Totally fine.
[39:21.220 --> 39:22.020]  Get up the next day.
[39:22.420 --> 39:26.520]  I look at Emily as a cautionary tale because Burndog cannot say no to food.
[39:26.780 --> 39:28.220]  So we walk by and he's like, oh, cuties.
[39:28.340 --> 39:29.020]  I'll take a cutie.
[39:29.060 --> 39:30.520]  And then he like buys oranges, bananas.
[39:30.760 --> 39:31.940]  And but it's not that too.
[39:32.000 --> 39:32.680]  It's like churros.
[39:32.880 --> 39:34.600]  And it's like, oh, I'll take two churros.
[39:35.100 --> 39:36.620]  Turkey leg. I'll take a turkey leg.
[39:37.120 --> 39:38.620]  Fucking Star Wars tippy up.
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.220]  I'll take some of that gross ass chicken, like whatever it is.
[39:41.220 --> 39:44.100]  And so we're just like walking from like, I'll take a coffee.
[39:44.220 --> 39:45.020]  I'll take a cold brew.
[39:45.120 --> 39:46.660]  I'll take a fucking soda.
[39:46.940 --> 39:48.740]  I'll take I'll take some water.
[39:48.860 --> 39:50.100]  I'll take churros.
[39:50.220 --> 39:52.000]  I'll take an ice cream sandwich.
[39:52.180 --> 39:53.760]  And it's just constantly all Saturday.
[39:53.840 --> 39:56.600]  And I'm having like a bite of most stuff, but I'm trying to take it easy
[39:56.600 --> 39:57.960]  because I don't want to end up like Emily.
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.940]  And I'm doing great and having a wonderful time, really enjoying Disneyland.
[40:03.860 --> 40:06.320]  Or at this point, it was California Adventure for me on Saturday.
[40:07.560 --> 40:10.320]  And I have learned through that other stupid podcast
[40:10.320 --> 40:13.320]  I did for a while with Jack that I no longer can ride roller coasters.
[40:13.480 --> 40:14.540]  I've developed nausea.
[40:14.960 --> 40:16.000]  I never had it.
[40:16.240 --> 40:19.300]  I never I was I was a brave little boy for most of my life.
[40:19.340 --> 40:21.940]  But somewhere in my 40s, I got scared of heights and roller coasters.
[40:22.260 --> 40:24.360]  And so I was good.
[40:24.460 --> 40:27.860]  I went on everything, got to the Incredicoaster, said, fuck it.
[40:27.860 --> 40:28.640]  I've been on it before.
[40:28.740 --> 40:30.120]  It made me nauseous, but I'm going to do it.
[40:30.220 --> 40:31.740]  I'm in the I'm in the right frame of mind.
[40:32.460 --> 40:33.740]  And I got on that Incredicoaster.
[40:33.840 --> 40:34.580]  I was doing great.
[40:34.580 --> 40:39.600]  And then we get to that one stupid loop, the upside down part that wrecked me, dude.
[40:39.660 --> 40:40.640]  It fucking wrecked me.
[40:40.720 --> 40:43.620]  For the next hour, I was brutally nauseous.
[40:43.740 --> 40:48.160]  And so I just had to like sit down by and just like sip on some water for a while
[40:48.160 --> 40:49.220]  till I recovered.
[40:49.460 --> 40:50.520]  That was fine for the rest of the day.
[40:51.160 --> 40:51.940]  Have a great time.
[40:52.000 --> 40:52.500]  We're hanging out.
[40:52.580 --> 40:54.160]  We part of our version of party.
[40:54.920 --> 40:57.400]  We're playing Uno or whatever and go to bed.
[40:58.580 --> 41:03.500]  Happy as a clam at two in the morning out of the blue, I wake up.
[41:04.980 --> 41:05.340]  Nauseous.
[41:06.200 --> 41:07.660]  And I'm like, that is strange.
[41:07.920 --> 41:10.420]  I don't ever wake up nauseous in the middle of the night.
[41:10.840 --> 41:15.440]  And I and I don't really get nauseous often, like in a real way.
[41:15.540 --> 41:18.620]  I very rarely suffer nausea.
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.500]  And I'm like, oh, maybe it'll go away.
[41:20.560 --> 41:22.780]  So I lay there for a little minute and I realize it's not going to go away.
[41:22.880 --> 41:24.260]  I get up and I go into the bathroom.
[41:24.340 --> 41:26.880]  And of course, it's a strange bathroom at a Westin hotel.
[41:27.060 --> 41:28.000]  All the lights are off.
[41:28.400 --> 41:29.540]  You know, I don't know where anything is.
[41:29.540 --> 41:34.500]  I'm fumbling around and I sit down on the toilet and I'm just like,
[41:34.500 --> 41:35.980]  maybe if I can just sit here and write it out.
[41:36.560 --> 41:41.480]  And then as I do that, sitting on the toilet activates the diarrhea.
[41:43.400 --> 41:46.980]  I immediately start explosive diarrhea.
[41:48.060 --> 41:51.560]  The diarrhea initiates the vomit.
[41:52.600 --> 41:56.300]  I look around because I realize my ass is tied to the toilet.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.840]  There's a trash can.
[41:57.940 --> 41:59.180]  I grab the trash can.
[41:59.220 --> 42:00.300]  I like reach over and I grab it.
[42:00.360 --> 42:01.600]  And it's the fucking heaviest.
[42:01.780 --> 42:03.080]  It's like made out of concrete.
[42:03.200 --> 42:04.240]  It's so heavy.
[42:04.240 --> 42:06.040]  I can't lift it to hold it.
[42:06.380 --> 42:09.160]  And I'm like, I'm like struggling to hold it up to throw into it.
[42:09.260 --> 42:12.920]  And I saw like, put it back on the ground and I can't like aim the puke at it.
[42:12.940 --> 42:13.920]  So I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[42:14.040 --> 42:19.140]  So I just like, I hold the puke in my mouth long enough until I stop shitting for just a second.
[42:19.280 --> 42:23.520]  Then I jump up and I spin around and I throw up into the toilet,
[42:23.720 --> 42:25.460]  which gets all over the front of the toilet.
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.200]  And then I have to, and I'm just like,
[42:30.860 --> 42:32.480]  not as much as Emily, but a lot.
[42:32.540 --> 42:33.680]  And I'm like, oh my God, oh my God.
[42:33.680 --> 42:37.960]  And as soon as it stops, I got to spin back around and slam down and diarrhea out the diarrhea
[42:37.960 --> 42:39.480]  and then spin around and throw up.
[42:39.560 --> 42:42.440]  And I do that like three times until it's all gone.
[42:42.960 --> 42:44.220]  And I'm just sweating.
[42:44.540 --> 42:49.420]  You know how you're like sweating, like you've run a marathon and you're clammy and you're exhausted
[42:49.420 --> 42:53.800]  and you're shaking from all of that, from that whole 45 second ordeal.
[42:54.440 --> 42:56.820]  It was maybe the worst 45 seconds of my life.
[42:57.200 --> 42:59.860]  And I like, I do the thing that I do every night.
[42:59.880 --> 43:03.380]  Now I get on the ground and I start cleaning up mess that I've made.
[43:03.380 --> 43:05.060]  And I'm just like clean.
[43:05.180 --> 43:06.880]  I get a towel and a washcloth.
[43:07.080 --> 43:07.980]  And of course, Emily's sleeping.
[43:08.120 --> 43:09.380]  She doesn't know any of this is going on.
[43:09.440 --> 43:12.320]  And I'm bouncing around and bumping into shit because I can't see anything.
[43:12.320 --> 43:15.820]  And I don't know what lights to turn on because you turn on one light in a fucking hotel bathroom
[43:15.820 --> 43:20.380]  and suddenly every light turns on and the fucking blinds open up and, you know, and it starts
[43:20.380 --> 43:22.140]  playing music and the TV's flashing.
[43:22.460 --> 43:27.100]  And so I just fumble around in the dark and I do everything in my power to clean it up.
[43:27.120 --> 43:28.940]  And I'm in that bathroom for God knows how long.
[43:28.940 --> 43:33.500]  And I get it all cleaned up, I think, and flushed and brush my teeth and wipe myself
[43:33.500 --> 43:34.200]  off and everything.
[43:34.500 --> 43:38.340]  And then I just go and I lay down and I go to bed and I pass out from exhaustion.
[43:38.620 --> 43:41.140]  And then we get up in the day and we're getting ready in the morning.
[43:41.460 --> 43:43.480]  And Bernie and Vanessa come over to our room.
[43:43.540 --> 43:46.560]  And I have haven't been in the toilet area at all.
[43:46.820 --> 43:48.200]  I've only brushed my teeth and stuff.
[43:48.520 --> 43:49.740]  And Bernie goes, I gotta take a piss.
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.340]  And he goes in the he doesn't take a piss.
[43:51.360 --> 43:53.020]  And he goes, oh, my God.
[43:53.580 --> 43:54.620]  And I'm like, what?
[43:54.700 --> 43:55.320]  And I run in.
[43:55.600 --> 43:57.960]  I had missed so much vomit.
[43:57.960 --> 44:01.720]  It was on the walls to the left of the toilet.
[44:02.080 --> 44:03.460]  It was like Purple Nightmare.
[44:03.780 --> 44:05.660]  It was on the top of the toilet.
[44:05.840 --> 44:07.800]  It was on the wall behind the toilet.
[44:08.400 --> 44:09.680]  It was everywhere.
[44:10.020 --> 44:13.180]  And I was horrified and mortified.
[44:13.640 --> 44:16.940]  It's one of the most embarrassing and grossest things I've ever done.
[44:17.500 --> 44:21.160]  And it's I hate to say it, not as gross as the next story.
[44:21.300 --> 44:22.360]  Oh, come on.
[44:22.360 --> 44:23.240]  Come on.
[44:23.760 --> 44:24.880]  What do you mean?
[44:24.960 --> 44:25.840]  Last night.
[44:26.200 --> 44:27.140]  Last night.
[44:27.140 --> 44:28.560]  By the way, I was fine after that.
[44:28.700 --> 44:29.880]  Had a great rest of the day.
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.320]  Last night, I played hooky.
[44:34.780 --> 44:35.560]  I stayed up late.
[44:36.100 --> 44:37.680]  And I was an irresponsible little boy.
[44:37.920 --> 44:40.300]  And I played video games with my friends until way too late.
[44:40.520 --> 44:46.400]  We played we played gun trucks as I've decided to start calling it until about until about
[44:46.400 --> 44:48.140]  well, just about 145 or so.
[44:48.200 --> 44:48.360]  Right.
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.520]  And then go to bed or go like shut everything down.
[44:52.640 --> 44:53.680]  Walk into the bedroom.
[44:54.260 --> 44:55.860]  Go to my side of the bed.
[44:56.340 --> 44:59.040]  Albert is sleeping on the far end of the bed with Emily.
[44:59.220 --> 44:59.800]  They're pretty far away.
[44:59.880 --> 45:00.440]  We have a king bed.
[45:00.520 --> 45:01.180]  So there's a lot of room.
[45:01.840 --> 45:03.380]  I smell a whiff of something.
[45:04.240 --> 45:08.760]  Once again, pitch black in my room, right as I'm about to get sit on my bed to like take
[45:08.760 --> 45:13.140]  my jammy pants off and take my shirt off and then get under the covers right where I'm
[45:13.140 --> 45:13.840]  about to sit.
[45:13.920 --> 45:15.720]  I just catch a whiff of something and I stop.
[45:15.800 --> 45:16.940]  It just makes me stop on my tracks.
[45:17.780 --> 45:21.920]  And I look and I can kind of see something like a mound on the bed.
[45:22.040 --> 45:23.220]  And I get in there.
[45:23.260 --> 45:24.300]  I look because, you know, it's pretty dark.
[45:24.380 --> 45:25.040]  There's a little bit of moonlight.
[45:25.040 --> 45:27.000]  And I realize the dog has thrown up.
[45:27.040 --> 45:31.840]  The dog has thrown up on my side of the bed, right at chest level, like right where I was
[45:31.840 --> 45:32.340]  about to sit.
[45:32.380 --> 45:35.400]  I was about to sit in a pile of dog vomit, right?
[45:35.980 --> 45:41.120]  And there by the grace of God or whoever, I smelled just a whiff of that.
[45:41.260 --> 45:45.200]  And maybe because I had just thrown up so much, I still had a little bit of that that
[45:45.200 --> 45:46.680]  puke smell in the back of my throat.
[45:46.680 --> 45:48.220]  I recognized it quickly.
[45:48.220 --> 45:54.820]  And I shut down before I accidentally sat my fucking soggy ass balls in dog puke.
[45:54.840 --> 45:55.040]  Right.
[45:55.700 --> 45:57.660]  So I'm like, oh, my God, this fucking sucks.
[45:57.960 --> 45:58.920]  Emily is asleep.
[45:59.240 --> 46:00.000]  The dog is asleep.
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.160]  I'm in the same situation where I don't want to wake them up because if the dog wakes up,
[46:04.240 --> 46:05.040]  all bets are off.
[46:05.060 --> 46:05.220]  Right.
[46:05.240 --> 46:07.620]  And then poor Emily, she works 12 hours a day.
[46:07.900 --> 46:09.100]  She needs her sleep.
[46:09.320 --> 46:15.220]  And so I like pick up all the dog puke and I put it in the toilet and I get some more
[46:15.220 --> 46:16.060]  and I put it in the toilet.
[46:16.060 --> 46:18.420]  And then I do my best to scrub it with a washcloth.
[46:18.500 --> 46:20.600]  And I realized I got to take the sheet off, like the blanket off.
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.120]  Luckily, we Emily is a weirdo and sleeps with 900 blankets.
[46:25.240 --> 46:26.780]  I've talked about her sleep procedure before.
[46:26.920 --> 46:28.800]  It includes like eight different blankets.
[46:28.940 --> 46:31.700]  She's like she has blanket mountain like Andrea's pillow mountain.
[46:32.200 --> 46:38.320]  And so I have to definitely take the comforter off around the dog and Emily without waking
[46:38.320 --> 46:38.700]  them up.
[46:38.720 --> 46:42.460]  And I go and I put it in the washing machine and I start doing laundry at this point, 2
[46:42.460 --> 46:43.600]  15 in the morning or whatever.
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.920]  And then I go back and I clean myself off and I crawl into bed and I put my hands on
[46:48.920 --> 46:53.640]  top of the blanket like at my, you know, you just put your hands down and I feel wet and
[46:53.640 --> 46:58.820]  I'm like, oh, and so I get up and I look and the puke had seeped through a little bit.
[46:59.020 --> 47:00.920]  So it was just damp.
[47:00.980 --> 47:02.520]  But that grossed me out so much.
[47:02.600 --> 47:07.820]  I get up out of bed and I strip that blanket off the bed around Emily and around the dog
[47:07.820 --> 47:10.240]  and I take it out into the other room because obviously I can't.
[47:10.260 --> 47:11.640]  I can only have one washing machine.
[47:12.040 --> 47:16.740]  And then I clean my hands off again and I go back in and I go to bed and I fall back
[47:16.740 --> 47:17.080]  asleep.
[47:18.680 --> 47:20.120]  Maybe two hours later.
[47:20.240 --> 47:23.140]  I don't know if I didn't look at a clock, but it's maybe four or four thirty in the
[47:23.140 --> 47:23.340]  morning.
[47:23.620 --> 47:25.600]  I wake up desperate to piss.
[47:26.460 --> 47:27.280]  Desperate to piss.
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.260]  And so I get up and I fumble and I'm I'm wrecked at this point, right?
[47:32.260 --> 47:33.540]  Because I stayed up way too late.
[47:33.580 --> 47:34.820]  I've only had two hours of sleep.
[47:35.180 --> 47:37.680]  I've I'm doing laundry in the middle of my sleep.
[47:37.700 --> 47:38.740]  It's a whole fucking thing.
[47:39.080 --> 47:43.020]  And I go into the bathroom and I sit down on the toilet and I piss and I'm just like
[47:43.780 --> 47:46.420]  kind of half asleep, just not all there, you know, as you are.
[47:46.500 --> 47:50.180]  And I reach back and I flush the toilet and I don't immediately get up and I don't know
[47:50.180 --> 47:54.040]  why, but I just like I'm just like sitting there for a second, you know, just, I don't
[47:54.040 --> 47:54.620]  know, existing.
[47:55.040 --> 48:00.540]  And then as I'm sitting there in the toilets flushing, as I'm about to get up and go to
[48:00.540 --> 48:04.820]  the bathroom, I because I sit down to pee at night because I don't want to turn lights
[48:04.820 --> 48:05.680]  on and wake my wife up, right?
[48:06.140 --> 48:06.320]  Yeah.
[48:07.020 --> 48:08.360]  Something really weird happens.
[48:08.360 --> 48:13.880]  I feel a sensation that immediately jolts me awake and I realize it's water on my dick
[48:13.880 --> 48:15.860]  and I'm like, why is there water on my dick?
[48:15.980 --> 48:21.160]  If I'm sitting in the toilet, I look down, the dog puke clogged the toilet.
[48:22.220 --> 48:28.120]  I pissed into the toilet, flushed the toilet, all the dog puke and piss came back up and
[48:28.120 --> 48:33.880]  my dick is in it, just sitting in it as the toilet is starting to overflow around me.
[48:33.880 --> 48:41.440]  So I have to jump up and unclog the toilet with a plunger for way too long while Emily
[48:41.440 --> 48:45.420]  and the dog are trying to sleep and then clean my entire body at this point because I have
[48:45.420 --> 48:50.280]  dipped my dick into dog puke and pee water at this point.
[48:50.480 --> 48:52.960]  And now I don't ever want to go to bed again.
[48:53.060 --> 48:54.340]  I'm scared of the dark.
[48:55.720 --> 48:56.360]  I don't.
[48:56.380 --> 48:59.060]  This has all been in the space of like six days.
[49:00.260 --> 49:06.700]  I, I, can you imagine when you were feeding Albert that you would, if imagine if someone
[49:06.700 --> 49:08.980]  came back through time and said, some of that would be on your dick, Leah.
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.700]  I couldn't in a million years.
[49:11.880 --> 49:12.740]  No, no.
[49:12.980 --> 49:14.460]  Two things.
[49:14.620 --> 49:18.220]  I did two things in the same night that I've never done before.
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.620]  I kicked my own dick and balls and then I stuck my dick in wet dog puke.
[49:23.760 --> 49:27.500]  Oh, oh, that's so gross.
[49:27.740 --> 49:28.700]  Terrible first.
[49:29.240 --> 49:32.240]  Terrible first to be having it 49 years old.
[49:32.340 --> 49:34.060]  And I'm then, now I'm the night plunger.
[49:34.760 --> 49:37.320]  That is a new horror that has been unlocked for me.
[49:37.580 --> 49:39.140]  And I just, I just, I'm wrecked.
[49:39.160 --> 49:39.920]  I don't know what to do.
[49:40.020 --> 49:41.500]  I don't know what to do about going to bed at night anymore.
[49:41.760 --> 49:43.900]  Maybe I'll just stay up and play video games till dawn.
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.140]  I don't know, but it's been, I'm just terrified.
[49:47.220 --> 49:48.140]  I'm scared to go to bed tonight.
[49:48.180 --> 49:49.100]  Honestly, I swear to God.
[49:49.400 --> 49:51.620]  So was it all flushed and then came back or you just.
[49:51.920 --> 49:52.840]  Yeah, it was all flushed.
[49:52.840 --> 49:54.660]  No, I had flushed and it was all flushed.
[49:54.700 --> 49:58.300]  But I guess, I guess it didn't, you know, I guess it was just like stuck in the tube
[49:58.300 --> 49:58.700]  or whatever.
[49:58.940 --> 50:01.620]  And so when I flushed again, it just like backed up.
[50:03.620 --> 50:04.900]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[50:05.860 --> 50:07.300]  You flushed while you're sick?
[50:07.900 --> 50:09.860]  Yeah, I flushed while I was sitting in that moment.
[50:10.360 --> 50:12.920]  I was just like I said, I was like, I was just like fucking exhausted.
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.580]  And I was sitting on the toilet and I peed and then I just reached my hand back to flush
[50:16.580 --> 50:18.400]  and I was going to get up or whatever right as I did it.
[50:18.420 --> 50:21.460]  But I just like, I just like sat there for a second because I wasn't,
[50:21.660 --> 50:23.080]  I didn't have my faculties about me.
[50:23.320 --> 50:25.780]  But I feel like sometimes if I do like a courtesy flush,
[50:25.780 --> 50:30.700]  I always lean forwards because otherwise your cock gets splashed.
[50:31.160 --> 50:32.560]  My toilet doesn't splash my cock.
[50:32.980 --> 50:36.220]  Yeah, this toilet, my old toilet definitely did.
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.340]  The one that I had the toilet on, it was like you couldn't put your dick anywhere near that
[50:40.340 --> 50:42.800]  toilet because there was water coming from every direction at all times.
[50:42.820 --> 50:42.940]  Yeah.
[50:43.100 --> 50:46.380]  But yeah, this one, this is kind of a, listen, it's a rental toilet, right?
[50:46.440 --> 50:48.160]  It's not, it's not the best toilet I've ever used.
[50:48.320 --> 50:49.560]  It's not even close.
[50:49.980 --> 50:53.560]  It's a, it's a toilet that because of the way the shelf sits, because it's shallow,
[50:53.560 --> 50:57.320]  I have to, it's why I'm a three scrubber a day kind of guy because of these toilets.
[50:57.460 --> 51:01.660]  I'm not, I'm not, I got no defense for these toilets, but, but they don't get my dick wet
[51:01.660 --> 51:02.360]  normally.
[51:06.860 --> 51:07.720]  Got a new tattoo.
[51:10.720 --> 51:11.920]  What is it of?
[51:13.440 --> 51:16.460]  Is it a, is it a heel on your balls?
[51:17.380 --> 51:18.560]  No, that's an idea.
[51:18.560 --> 51:24.240]  Uh, you remember when we were having that whole conversation about, uh, the pineapple
[51:24.240 --> 51:28.780]  tattoo that Emily and I have and how we unintentionally got swingers tattoos, even though
[51:28.780 --> 51:33.260]  they're not upside down pineapples, it's still like kind of creeps us out and it's kind of
[51:33.260 --> 51:34.240]  embarrassing and funny.
[51:34.700 --> 51:39.500]  Uh, well, Emily, the other day at work was screwing around, uh, in the back room on her
[51:39.500 --> 51:44.920]  break and she drew on her, uh, on her little pineapple.
[51:44.920 --> 51:48.940]  She drew a pair of sunglasses and she thought it was really cute.
[51:48.960 --> 51:52.680]  And she was like, what if we redid our tattoos?
[51:52.760 --> 51:55.440]  What if we modified our tattoos to be party pineapples?
[51:56.020 --> 52:03.400]  And so on her birthday we went and we got, I got, we got sunglasses, arms and legs put
[52:03.400 --> 52:04.160]  on our tattoos.
[52:04.400 --> 52:07.460]  I took it and it's upside down because I'm, I don't give a shit.
[52:07.520 --> 52:10.500]  But anyway, so, uh, that's my new party pineapple tattoo.
[52:11.080 --> 52:19.300]  Wait, you don't give a shit when the whole point of the, oh no, that's just a photo.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.620]  I just took a photo upside down.
[52:20.820 --> 52:21.280]  No, I know.
[52:21.380 --> 52:23.960]  But you, the whole point of the pineapple was that, you know, if it would be upside
[52:23.960 --> 52:26.580]  down and then you send it to us upside down.
[52:26.680 --> 52:26.880]  Yeah.
[52:26.880 --> 52:28.280]  Just cause I'm a bad photographer though.
[52:28.360 --> 52:28.900]  Here, hold on.
[52:30.060 --> 52:30.500]  Hold on.
[52:30.900 --> 52:31.080]  Okay.
[52:33.540 --> 52:34.160]  That's great.
[52:34.380 --> 52:34.900]  That's phenomenal.
[52:35.760 --> 52:37.820]  Anyway, you can see the little heels on his shoes.
[52:37.920 --> 52:38.040]  Yeah.
[52:38.040 --> 52:39.540]  He's got little hands and little boot.
[52:39.540 --> 52:41.820]  He's got little SpongeBob shoes and then sunglasses.
[52:42.580 --> 52:46.380]  So anyway, now we have party pineapple tattoos and you look at that tattoo too.
[52:46.760 --> 52:47.120]  What?
[52:47.980 --> 52:48.200]  What?
[52:49.560 --> 52:52.160]  You look at that tattoo and you don't think swinger.
[52:52.420 --> 52:57.620]  You think that person's down to party, but a healthy, uh, keep your clothes on kind of
[52:57.620 --> 52:57.920]  partying.
[52:58.900 --> 52:59.120]  Yeah.
[52:59.160 --> 53:02.140]  I mean, I agree until you send us a photo of it upside down.
[53:02.640 --> 53:02.740]  Yeah.
[53:02.840 --> 53:04.080]  Well, it's just cause I'm a shitty photographer.
[53:04.260 --> 53:06.020]  I think it was a Freudian photography.
[53:06.380 --> 53:06.920]  It might have been.
[53:08.120 --> 53:08.700]  A Freudian snap.
[53:08.700 --> 53:10.860]  Yeah, Freudian snap.
[53:12.500 --> 53:14.560]  Oh, Geoff, I'm so sorry, man.
[53:14.940 --> 53:15.720]  Hey, thanks.
[53:15.920 --> 53:18.460]  It's been a real dog shit kind of couple days in that way.
[53:18.620 --> 53:20.080]  Did you at least enjoy Survivor?
[53:20.300 --> 53:20.800]  Their guy?
[53:21.220 --> 53:23.840]  I loved Survivor and I love our guy.
[53:24.340 --> 53:28.580]  I don't want to spoil the show for people that haven't seen it on this podcast.
[53:28.780 --> 53:30.100]  Even maybe they haven't seen it like Gavin.
[53:30.180 --> 53:30.480]  I don't know.
[53:30.540 --> 53:32.080]  But man, it was a great episode.
[53:32.800 --> 53:37.480]  Uh, and he is really seems really genuinely likable.
[53:38.040 --> 53:38.380]  Yes.
[53:38.380 --> 53:43.580]  Like one of the most one of the standout initial standout likable people on the show.
[53:43.720 --> 53:43.980]  Absolutely.
[53:44.020 --> 53:45.180]  I mean, I liked him on this podcast.
[53:45.640 --> 53:48.080]  I liked his, I liked his stance.
[53:48.860 --> 53:50.200]  Yeah, I think we all like the stance.
[53:50.560 --> 53:54.400]  Well, you know, the opinion is divided, maybe on a stance.
[53:54.700 --> 53:56.340]  I don't, you know, I don't think we're unified in that.
[53:56.460 --> 53:58.200]  But great first episode.
[53:58.340 --> 54:01.340]  And I feel really good about him sticking around for a while.
[54:01.400 --> 54:02.940]  It seems like he's on a really good team.
[54:03.440 --> 54:06.140]  I don't think they're going to go too tribal for a bit.
[54:06.240 --> 54:07.920]  So I'm excited.
[54:08.520 --> 54:09.600]  Really enjoy catch up.
[54:09.840 --> 54:13.000]  Yeah, I think we're going to get to see him on on TV for a little bit, which is going to be nice.
[54:13.140 --> 54:16.780]  When I was at Disneyland, there were a billion families there, right?
[54:16.780 --> 54:17.400]  Because it's Disneyland.
[54:17.720 --> 54:20.980]  And apparently it was ski week, which is something that exists on the West Coast.
[54:21.200 --> 54:21.860]  I hadn't heard of.
[54:21.920 --> 54:26.860]  Yeah, I guess before spring break in California and other places in, I guess, the Pacific
[54:26.860 --> 54:31.240]  Northwest, they have a ski week where kids get off school to go skiing for the week.
[54:31.700 --> 54:34.320]  And so they're and but they don't go skiing.
[54:34.380 --> 54:35.600]  They go to Disneyland for some reason.
[54:35.720 --> 54:37.760]  So there was 10 billion people in Disneyland.
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.080]  But there were so many kids and families there that just looked miserable.
[54:42.660 --> 54:48.740]  And all I could think about is how many times I took Millie to places around the world or
[54:48.740 --> 54:50.900]  to theme parks or to things like this as a child.
[54:51.040 --> 54:52.720]  And she has zero memory of it.
[54:52.780 --> 54:55.240]  I'll be like, hey, do you remember that time we did that thing in Tokyo?
[54:55.240 --> 54:56.460]  And she's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[54:56.480 --> 54:58.800]  And I'm like, you you were like eight.
[54:58.920 --> 54:59.980]  And she's like, yeah, I don't know.
[55:00.000 --> 55:00.800]  I don't remember that far back.
[55:00.980 --> 55:03.880]  And I realized that most of it was worthless.
[55:03.880 --> 55:08.240]  You're just doing it for yourself because the kid is not going to remember any of it,
[55:08.240 --> 55:09.660]  which gave me an idea.
[55:10.280 --> 55:18.240]  Do you think you could, with the use of AI, just invent a bunch of family vacation photos
[55:18.700 --> 55:23.440]  for your kid's childhood and just display them around?
[55:23.720 --> 55:26.180]  And if your kid ever asks about it, just be like, wait, you don't remember?
[55:26.320 --> 55:29.980]  We used to go every fucking year because they're not going to remember anyway.
[55:30.120 --> 55:32.900]  So why waste the time and the money going to Disneyland?
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.320]  Just Photoshop or get AI to make a couple of pictures of your kid really happy or crying
[55:38.320 --> 55:41.060]  with a fucking spilled ice cream on the ground and be like, yeah, that was the time when you
[55:41.060 --> 55:41.800]  were six. We went to Disneyland.
[55:41.920 --> 55:42.400]  You loved it. Remember?
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.020]  You don't remember that?
[55:43.220 --> 55:43.820]  Yeah, you got a shirt.
[55:43.880 --> 55:44.460]  I think we threw it away.
[55:44.840 --> 55:48.740]  I just immediately visualized that scene in The Truman Show where they're showing him as
[55:48.740 --> 55:50.200]  a kid in front of Mount Rushmore.
[55:51.360 --> 55:52.820]  Yeah, it's essentially that, right?
[55:53.520 --> 55:57.600]  You could totally do that and get away with it because your kid would never know.
[55:57.900 --> 55:59.480]  Maybe that'd be a good service you could start.
[55:59.480 --> 56:03.620]  You could start the retroactive good parenting pack.
[56:04.280 --> 56:07.460]  Yeah, the childhood memories pack.
[56:09.360 --> 56:16.620]  You give us like 30 photos of your kid and we'll give that kid the childhood of a lifetime.
[56:17.460 --> 56:20.080]  Win them over by putting their children into AI.
[56:21.240 --> 56:26.780]  I really like this as a game show where it's like family photos and the kid has to figure
[56:26.780 --> 56:28.220]  out which ones are real.
[56:28.380 --> 56:33.200]  And it's just parents in the background crying, knowing how much they spent on these trips.
[56:33.220 --> 56:38.340]  This one, this one yearly trip that they would go on or like the big trip across multiple years.
[56:38.540 --> 56:41.240]  This is not, I've never been there, never seen it.
[56:41.920 --> 56:45.900]  It is criminal how little kids remember of those vacations.
[56:46.460 --> 56:47.920]  I remember my first vacation.
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.560]  My parents were a little bit bummed to find out that the only thing I remembered from going to
[56:52.560 --> 56:56.820]  Spain as a kid was that I really liked the fire hose in the hotel.
[56:58.140 --> 57:02.580]  I apparently really liked stuff that would go around, around, around, around.
[57:03.260 --> 57:07.840]  And, uh, like wheels, uh, the washing machine, fire hose, loved it.
[57:08.280 --> 57:09.280]  Loved round stuff.
[57:11.080 --> 57:12.300]  Big round guy.
[57:12.920 --> 57:14.340]  As a kid, loved it.
[57:14.640 --> 57:17.940]  Like if people were visiting, I would run outside when they left to watch the wheels
[57:17.940 --> 57:19.280]  on the car as they drove.
[57:19.880 --> 57:23.440]  I remember my first vacation.
[57:24.400 --> 57:31.920]  I was a big Scooby-Doo kid and we went to some hotel in San Francisco and the bookshelf
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.500]  was a secret like there is a bookshelf in the room and you could open it and it was a closet.
[57:38.640 --> 57:40.920]  It was just like a coat closet, essentially.
[57:41.240 --> 57:45.160]  It was not a fancy secret room, but I opened it not knowing it was there.
[57:45.660 --> 57:48.580]  It was one of those things like Scooby-Doo or the bookshelves always open.
[57:48.580 --> 57:53.140]  So I was like, I'll pull on this bookshelf and then it actually opened and I was so excited
[57:53.140 --> 57:59.580]  and it greatly falsely set my expectation for how many times in life I will encounter a book
[57:59.580 --> 58:01.200]  shelf that opens into something.
[58:01.860 --> 58:02.740]  That was it.
[58:03.300 --> 58:04.240]  One and done.
[58:04.380 --> 58:09.020]  But as a kid, I was like, Oh my God, are these just things like is this prevalent?
[58:09.220 --> 58:11.080]  Is this is the thing that will happen to me?
[58:11.420 --> 58:15.800]  And I've never encountered another bookshelf that has something behind it.
[58:16.220 --> 58:17.000]  Very sad.
[58:17.000 --> 58:17.460]  I know what you mean.
[58:17.560 --> 58:21.740]  When I was a kid, because of Webster, I thought every cuckoo clock had a secret passage in it.
[58:22.460 --> 58:23.700]  Oh, that's cool.
[58:24.380 --> 58:28.240]  So did you ever go to the library as a kid and just get really bummed out that none of them were doors?
[58:32.080 --> 58:33.500]  It's got to be one somewhere.
[58:33.800 --> 58:37.500]  They keep telling me books are a door to my imagination, but I can't open the fucking thing.
[58:40.580 --> 58:43.260]  I was cleaning up my notes as you were telling that story, Andrew.
[58:43.340 --> 58:45.580]  And I saw this note, the note from my story.
[58:45.580 --> 58:48.200]  I just had to post it to you guys before I deleted it because it's fucking...
[58:48.200 --> 58:49.280]  I realized how ludicrous it looked.
[58:49.540 --> 58:51.640]  Cock, puke, water, penis, puke, and shit LA.
[58:52.960 --> 58:54.580]  I like the idea.
[58:54.860 --> 58:56.140]  It's like, this is a good idea.
[58:56.440 --> 58:59.560]  Regulation ID is cock, puke, water, penis, puke, and shit LA.
[59:02.160 --> 59:06.640]  So you both poisoned yourselves just from rides and candy?
[59:06.940 --> 59:07.360]  I think so.
[59:07.420 --> 59:08.420]  You surely had something bad.
[59:08.720 --> 59:11.480]  How could you get that sick from just sloshing around?
[59:11.540 --> 59:12.500]  Two different days apart?
[59:12.980 --> 59:13.420]  I don't know.
[59:13.660 --> 59:15.340]  Like she peeked on one night and I peeked the next.
[59:15.340 --> 59:17.880]  And I felt fine after and I felt fine when I went to bed.
[59:18.080 --> 59:20.400]  I only felt bad at two in the morning when I woke up.
[59:20.440 --> 59:23.920]  I think it was just like motion sickness and stuff from the...
[59:23.920 --> 59:24.980]  That makes sense for puke.
[59:25.060 --> 59:27.220]  Like I've definitely puked from being shaken around.
[59:27.320 --> 59:29.800]  But diarrhea, how did that happen?
[59:30.040 --> 59:34.440]  I think all the nausea and stuff in addition to the...
[59:35.260 --> 59:36.320]  God, we tried to list it.
[59:36.420 --> 59:40.380]  Bernie and I tried to list it the other day and it was like, it was too much, dude.
[59:41.280 --> 59:43.020]  Well, then you said you got a McDonald's straight after.
[59:43.660 --> 59:44.600]  Oh, I had McDonald's.
[59:44.600 --> 59:46.840]  Yeah, yeah, then we had McDonald's right after.
[59:47.600 --> 59:48.480]  It was pretty bad.
[59:48.840 --> 59:52.820]  Well, and once again, like Geoff, you deal with like diverticulitis, right?
[59:52.840 --> 59:54.900]  Like you have stomach issues, you have bowel issues.
[59:55.420 --> 59:59.360]  Like I think shaking is possible in Geoff's environment.
[59:59.700 --> 01:00:00.680]  Oh, that's another thing.
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:01.400]  It's true.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.180]  It's like all shit is diarrhea for me.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:07.240]  You know, it's like I haven't not had diarrhea in 10 years.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.080]  So it's just varying degrees of how bad it's going to be.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.080]  So if I had to poop in the middle of night, it was going to be diarrhea regardless.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.400]  This was just another level.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:20.080]  And I think it was just another level because of the level of terrible things I ingested that day.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.740]  Oh, man.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:27.140]  You were talking about that with the truck boys because we were playing Warzone recently.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:32.980]  And then last night, well, this is what blew me away a little bit earlier,
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.040]  right before we started recording.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.320]  Because last night you played and I went to bed early because it was a school night.
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.900]  And Andrew said, what do you mean school night?
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:42.820]  Yeah, what do you mean?
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.880]  That's been a thing since F*** Face.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:46.820]  Yeah.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.360]  Yeah, but also just in general.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.800]  You never had a school night?
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.480]  No, I understand the premise of a school night.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:53.340]  No, I get that.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.460]  You can't sleep late on a school night, Andrew.
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:55.500]  No, I get that.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.300]  I didn't know that you were still in a need a good sleep school night era.
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.940]  Oh, but for a Wednesday night, I try and get the best sleep of my life.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.520]  Really?
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.780]  I'm ready for the recording.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.900]  How has that gone for you?
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.280]  Statistically speaking, how many Wednesday nights since the show has started,
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.920]  would you describe as the best sleep of your life?
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.040]  It's typically the worst night of sleep I get.
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:17.680]  Yeah, it's awful.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.140]  Mainly because I'm thinking about everything the next night or the next day and I'm worried
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.720]  about I'm trying to get all my stories and my ideas and I end up just thinking.
[01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.800]  I had a dreadful sleep because I stayed up until 4 a.m.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:33.020]  Is it because you were sat up, right, trying to fall asleep?
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:36.880]  No, no, I, I, I fucked up real bad.
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.720]  And I had a donut for my partner and I misplaced the box.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.360]  I thought it was one place when it wasn't.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.980]  And I noticed when I was kind of moving around in my chair
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.780]  earlier in the evening that there was like something stuck in it.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.140]  And I was like, well, it's fucking annoying.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.840]  And they were really hungry.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.540]  They came to bed to get their donut.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.920]  And I had driven over their donut in my office chair.
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.100]  I ruined it.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:02.600]  Why?
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.220]  Okay, I'm going to ask the obvious question.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:08.420]  And I think everyone's assuming the same thing.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.920]  Why was it on the floor?
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.540]  Because I'm cleaning.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.300]  I'm cleaning somewhere.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.480]  Why was it there?
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.320]  That's where that's where clocks go.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.600]  And other important items in Gavin's office.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.060]  That's where mirrors go for you where you shave.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.780]  The floor's dirty.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.600]  That's where all the stuff lands.
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.660]  It was in a box.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.520]  It was completely sealed.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.740]  I had moved it.
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.900]  I bought a new storage thing for vinyls.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:40.960]  And so I put all the vinyls in there and they had on top of it.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.380]  And then I went to move the vinyl thing.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.980]  So I moved the box and I just forgot that I had done that.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.060]  And then at some point I would have wheeled the chair back.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.220]  And I'm also changing like bedsheet stuff.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.100]  So I thought, oh, I just got some sheets in the wheels.
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:55.480]  Whatever.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.940]  That sucks, but I'll just force on through.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.700]  But it wasn't sheets.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.720]  It was the box.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:07.880]  And I had crumpled the box and the donut and they found it on the floor.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.620]  And they were very upset about it.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.500]  Understandably so.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.940]  So I thought, I need to make this right.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:13.860]  They're hungry.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.580]  They're going to be hungry when they wake up in the morning when I do the show.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.540]  I'm going to order a little little treat.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:24.560]  We get breakfast delivered to the house on time before it starts.
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.820]  Except Uber Eats would not let me schedule an order in advance.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.740]  And then it was a whole thing where like they wouldn't show me the breakfast menu until
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.820]  4 a.m. for this place.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.460]  And so I just stayed up till 4 a.m.
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.860]  So I could order this because I fucked up that donut.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.720]  And then I just couldn't sleep.
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.720]  So I'm probably on like an hour.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:48.380]  If you have to if you have to do something in the morning,
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:54.320]  your go to move is just to wait until just go to sleep and wake up later.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.440]  How am I going?
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.420]  No, I don't trust myself with vibrate.
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.120]  I know I'm going to sleep through a vibrate.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.660]  Thought about it.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.300]  Even if you were mad at your partner and wanted to do something mean to them
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.920]  to express your anger, it wouldn't be as mean as the thing you accidentally did.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.700]  Yeah, it was I felt terrible.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.640]  It's like not only did I destroy it, I fucking
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.060]  rubbed into the ground to make sure nobody on Earth will ever enjoy
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.940]  one fucking morsel of this food.
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:26.660]  And then I covered everything in its like corpse, essentially.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.840]  And it was at like eleven thirty at night.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.840]  It was like it was too late to fix.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:32.800]  It was just it was a bad moment.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.140]  So you waited for the breakfast menu to show up.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.560]  You waited until four.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:38.600]  Yeah.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.760]  And even though it's a school night.
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.300]  Well, what's yeah.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.520]  Well, what was infuriating about it is it kept
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.260]  I have like five McDonald's in this town
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.920]  and they close at different times and I'd wait for one to close.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.660]  Because it wouldn't let me schedule an order unless it was closed.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.500]  And as soon as one would close,
[01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.680]  they would just pivot me to a different McDonald's that was open later.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.680]  And I kept progressing the clock back
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.340]  until I eventually found a way to view all of the McDonald's.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.960]  And then it wouldn't let me schedule it because I couldn't.
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:10.220]  I was just it was a whole thing.
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.500]  Wouldn't the move just be ideal?
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:13.300]  I'll deal with it tomorrow.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.960]  No, because I wake we wake up on the same alarm for the show.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.500]  So how how would I wake myself up?
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.060]  There's no way for me to wake myself up without waking them.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.420]  Wake up and order it.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.600]  But I'm I'm I'm four a.m.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.080]  I'm going to need an alarm.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.760]  I have to wake up in four hours.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:31.460]  I haven't slept.
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.380]  Wait, what?
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.820]  What time are they waking up?
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:35.300]  They wake up when I wake up.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.820]  But why did you order it when you woke up?
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.780]  Because I because there's not.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:45.060]  OK, let me explain.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:45.540]  Let me know.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:46.000]  I understand.
[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:46.840]  I understand the confusion.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.160]  They they like waking up.
[01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:56.000]  I wake up and they wake up 30 minutes before I record just to like relax,
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.640]  slowly wake up before having to leave the space for me to work.
[01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:04.540]  So I wouldn't I wanted to get us both breakfast.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.180]  So it had to be then.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.920]  And I want I assume they'd be hungry when they woke up because they were hungry when
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.400]  they went to bed.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:13.220]  So I wanted to be able to provide food as soon as they woke up,
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.560]  as a make good for destroying the doughnut.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.280]  Here's the thing about doughnut as well.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.960]  Anyone can lose the doughnut and it's fine if you if you lose out on a doughnut.
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.900]  It was just a tree anyway.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.400]  A doughnut surely isn't isn't like a guaranteed part of the meal that you are relying on.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.920]  OK, well, here's the thing.
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:33.340]  I ruined two doughnuts, actually.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.660]  That was the backup doughnut.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.160]  Yeah, I forgot about that.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:49.100]  I mean, I had.
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.440]  So I got I had doughnuts, I had doughnut holes the night before.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.560]  And I saved one because it was from a place we'd never been to.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.020]  And I ate them all the first time.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.000]  And this is the second time that I've ordered from this place as I made sure to save one.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.440]  But then they didn't end up eating it and they burnt the doughnuts.
[01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.140]  And so it was really dry.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.900]  So I ended up throwing it away.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:13.960]  So they went to get it and they went, oh, no, you didn't tell me that you got rid of it.
[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:15.900]  And that was that I took a hit there.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.980]  And I said, well, you got the other doughnut.
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.180]  So you got that at least.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:20.720]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.380]  And then they left and then they came back a few hours later.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:32.620]  Went for the other doughnut that I assured them was there and discovered it trampled.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.180]  Why is the doughnut a part of dinner, though?
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.640]  They just wanted a doughnut.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.580]  They were hungry and it was what was upstairs.
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.860]  Oh, sometimes you just want a doughnut.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.960]  Listen, you don't like sugar.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:46.760]  You don't like sweet things.
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:48.140]  I don't expect you understand this.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:48.820]  It's true.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.640]  I mean, I'll have a doughnut.
[01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:54.060]  Usually it's like morning coffee doughnut.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:56.760]  I don't like I don't like 11 p.m. doughnut.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.040]  I don't think this is I think that's on you.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.820]  And that's that's the difference between cultures, maybe.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.440]  Yeah, I've also I've also never really bought like a six or a dozen pack of doughnuts.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.700]  I'm just like a one doughnut guy.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.420]  I wonder at this point with everything that Andrew's told us about this doughnut,
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.760]  what else he's leaving out or doesn't remember with a whole.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:22.940]  Yeah, there's like a second doughnut involved with this really threw me for a loop, dude.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.420]  Yeah, no, it's fair.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.020]  There was no third doughnut.
[01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.460]  There would have been.
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.720]  However, I had eaten.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:30.540]  I would have eaten.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.920]  That would have been one I consumed.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.280]  How many were eaten then of this pack of doughnuts?
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.700]  OK, so it was a 10 pack of the mini doughnuts from the other night.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:40.660]  I ate nine of them.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.440]  And then what?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.240]  And then I I didn't eat any of the other doughnuts.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:50.780]  I got a Danish instead, and they had a doughnut from this.
[01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.220]  But how could you eat nine doughnuts in a day?
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.460]  They're mini doughnuts.
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:55.740]  Mini doughnuts.
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.060]  Like that's still a lot.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:57.860]  That's that.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.780]  How many like full?
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:08:59.380]  No.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:08:59.920]  Is it?
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:00.960]  It's not it.
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:02.220]  It's not a lot.
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.000]  OK.
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.720]  I could house so many more than that without even thinking about it.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.140]  If they're the powdered sugar Donell doughnuts, I could eat 40 right now.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:14.640]  And without skipping a beat.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:15.180]  Dude, you gave me the chocolate ones?
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.300]  Unstoppable.
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:18.380]  I won't even take a fucking breath, dude.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.920]  It sounds like we got to do an Eric versus Geoff mini doughnut.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:23.220]  I'll challenge you.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:23.940]  Put it on the board.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:24.720]  Put it on the board.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.240]  I'll feel so sick.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.400]  I don't give a fuck.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:29.880]  We'll make a day out of it.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.760]  Eric and I, Eric and I will eat doughnuts and we'll ice Gavin's balls.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.340]  That's I'm putting it on the.
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.660]  I'll put it on the list.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.180]  Supplemental.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:43.120]  Geoff versus Eric eating little doughnuts.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.140]  Go get your dilly bar, Nick.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:46.880]  It's going to melt.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.540]  While he's getting your that bar.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.480]  Can I ask you guys a question?
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.100]  I'm in a bit of a confused and paranoid era.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.840]  And I was hoping you guys could help me with a little bit of clarification if you don't mind.
[01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:57.420]  OK.
[01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:57.680]  OK.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:03.440]  The other day I texted everybody a link to a TikTok I saw.
[01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.340]  The TikTok was of some people playing baseball.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:12.400]  And what they had done is they had put an egg on like a stand,
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.040]  like essentially at the pitcher's mound.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.380]  And then they were trying to hit baseballs at the egg and crack the egg.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:18.700]  Right.
[01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:20.620]  So I sent that to all of you.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.140]  And I said, this is funny.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.300]  We could do something like this.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:31.220]  But what if it was like a minefield of all of our own personal stuff that we don't want broken
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:34.540]  and we have to try to break it or break other people's stuff or whatever.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:38.120]  And we just kind of like populate a baseball field with shit that matters to us,
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.040]  that's breakable.
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.320]  And then we just try to destroy it.
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:44.000]  And then I never heard back from anybody.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:47.840]  And I thought, oh, I'm not supposed to text these guys because I don't get the responses
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.640]  from the green text.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.920]  And then I thought, or maybe that was a one-time thing.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.840]  And maybe just nobody liked my idea or thought or even responded.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.080]  And I don't know which was which.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.580]  And so I decided to wait until the episode to ask.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.920]  So it's a confusing thing to add.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.500]  God damn it, you replied.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.400]  I never got it.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.960]  No, no comment, Geoff.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:08.900]  I don't know.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:13.060]  Did you reply in the same text thread, Gavin, as the thing?
[01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:14.200]  Do you want a screenshot?
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.960]  Yes, I'd love it.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:19.320]  Because I have a text group called Regulation Texting.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.180]  And that's where that went.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.820]  But I have another text group that is all of you guys as well.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.180]  And your messages go in that one.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.940]  So wait, what's in the original one?
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.200]  I'm going to post a quick screenshot.
[01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:40.980]  This is what I saw from my perspective of Geoff's text and then nothing in that text room.
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.060]  In response to it.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.080]  Look at mine.
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:45.740]  See that?
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:47.900]  Yeah, I got Gavin replying.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.660]  A really cool opportunity came through this morning.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:51.680]  I don't see that either.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.460]  What is that about?
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:53.600]  What?
[01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:55.120]  You've talked about it already.
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:57.940]  No, you guys were talking about it earlier.
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.440]  And I thought I must have missed the first half of the conversation
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.520]  because I got up to get a drink.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:04.020]  So I just picked up on it from context clues.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120]  But I had no idea where it originated from.
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.500]  So you didn't get any of that?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.240]  Like they must have heard how many players Worms WMD has and Eric Singh.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.700]  I don't know what any of that what you're saying is now.
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:14.520]  Here's what I have.
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.920]  I feel like somehow this is Geoff's fault.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.400]  I'm getting them in two different boxes, but I'm getting all of them.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.200]  They're just separated.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.660]  Is that why, Geoff, the other day you were like,
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:25.000]  hey, is everything all right with everyone?
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:25.940]  Maybe.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.440]  No, he just wanted to check in on us.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:29.120]  I just had a weird vibe.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:30.600]  Here's what I got.
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:31.860]  Here's what I got.
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.060]  I just texted test.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.780]  Did you get those test texts?
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.960]  I got test.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:38.040]  I got test.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.620]  It's below Andrew's screenshot.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:40.340]  Yeah.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:41.600]  No, I didn't get test.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.860]  I did one above it and then one below it.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.660]  And so the problem here is Geoff.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.680]  Yeah, Geoff, you're just not getting text.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.820]  Do you have RCS turned on?
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:50.720]  Probably not.
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:51.740]  What is RCS?
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:52.760]  How do I turn that on?
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:57.960]  I believe it uses the internet for cell.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.300]  Previously would have been like a cellular message.
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:01.400]  RCS messaging.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:03.100]  Do I want it turned on or off?
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:03.780]  On.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.120]  On.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:05.000]  It's on.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:09.360]  Because it's kind of like how you can use the internet for texting green.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.780]  Yeah, I don't know, because it's never been an issue before.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:15.920]  But now all of a sudden, I just it's I can't.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.680]  Maybe we just have to start a new text thread.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.120]  Maybe we can demolish that one and start a new one.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.820]  Because here, hold on, we're going to load up Discord.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.520]  This is...
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.260]  Maybe someone deleted it on their phone and then it created a new one on their phone.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.120]  Maybe because this is this is what I have.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.880]  This is the most recent conversation I have from you guys is Monday at 635 p.m.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.760]  When I sent you that TikTok.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.060]  I've received nothing from the company since then.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.880]  What the fuck?
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.860]  So I'm completely in the dark of anything you may delete this thread.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:48.600]  We talk all the time.
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.880]  No, we don't.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.020]  We don't talk all the time.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:52.180]  We absolutely don't.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.100]  Delete that conversation.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:58.940]  So you've missed one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.400]  Both from the podcast.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:01.160]  Yeah.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:05.000]  That's why I'm brought it up, because I'm terrified that I'm missing stuff.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.300]  Yeah, you are.
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:07.540]  Damn.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.220]  I don't even know how to fix that.
[01:14:09.220 --> 01:14:11.980]  I feel like Andrew's usually to blame, but this feels like a Geoff thing.
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:12.860]  It is a Geoff thing.
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.160]  I'm going to delete it.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.220]  This conversation will be deleted.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.400]  I fight back against Andrew's to blame.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.040]  This Andrew's to blame narrative.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.220]  Well, it's just it's it's a thing where I think we're all on iPhone.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.060]  Yeah, you have to blame clearly.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.240]  You're international.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.280]  Like there's like so many.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:33.160]  That's fair.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:33.640]  That's fair.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.400]  I thought we meant a general sense.
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.680]  No, I thought we were doing a general narrative.
[01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.160]  I would say that we're talking about things to blame.
[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:49.640]  I'm always having to fucking hunt down Gavin for files that he hasn't uploaded for Let's
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.160]  Play stuff.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:50.400]  Yep.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.760]  I have noticed that decline in my habit is that it's no longer one.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.580]  And I don't know why.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.720]  And I had to ask him for something.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:02.060]  And I eventually I finally just asked you, why?
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.160]  Why does this happen?
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:03.740]  Like, do you forget?
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:06.240]  Not in a way of like aggressive.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.640]  I was just like, how does this keep happening?
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.820]  You're the only one that I really have to do this with.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:11.520]  No idea.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.020]  I've always got it.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:14.160]  I've never deleted it.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.500]  Yes, you always find it immediately.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.680]  Like once we talk, you're like, yeah, I have it.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.480]  I'm uploading it now.
[01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:20.860]  I was like, why?
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:22.020]  Why does this happen?
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.220]  And it was the I think only time Eric has ever uploaded the wrong file into something.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.020]  And I was I finally asked.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:30.760]  I counted.
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.460]  I've had to ask you 19 times for different files.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.460]  My God.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:38.320]  Eric has once prior to this.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.080]  I finally asked you, why is this happening?
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:44.060]  And your response was, well, Eric uploaded the wrong file.
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.560]  That's certainly just as bad.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:46.820]  And I went, you motherfucker.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.600]  The one time, the one time you haven't out with Eric, you son of a bitch.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.800]  And then you never acknowledged the question again.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.720]  You just floated into the night.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.340]  Yeah, I apologize.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.120]  I don't know why I stopped.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:03.440]  I think it's when I switched to doing video on one computer and audio on the other.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.460]  Makes total sense.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.140]  One or the other.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.380]  I notice it.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.720]  It's especially bad if we batch record.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.060]  So I feel like you just don't go through the upload process and then you forget and walk away.
[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:13.460]  Is my.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.600]  Can I tell you something as well, though?
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.740]  You you recently asked me to upload files for video that was being edited.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.800]  And it was something we've recorded a ton of.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.320]  So I went ahead and looked at the folders after that.
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.160]  I hadn't put audio or video in for like the next four videos.
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:28.380]  What is wrong with you?
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.300]  And I quickly did it all before it became a problem.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.820]  Are you fucking new?
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:33.120]  Like, what are you?
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:34.420]  I have new brain.
[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.800]  I really appreciate that, Kevin.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:35.980]  Yep.
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.040]  Yeah, I saw your test and I saw that you changed the name and I replied.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:40.900]  I got the test.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:41.880]  I didn't get it.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.500]  OK, you are on SMS and not RCS.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.660]  I have RCS enabled.
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:47.700]  It says it's enabled.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.500]  It says.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.300]  Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.000]  It says SMS.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:52.480]  It says SMS for you and RCS for everyone else.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:52.900]  Yep.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:54.940]  That's weird.
[01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:57.200]  What is it?
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:57.840]  What is it called again?
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:58.460]  RCS?
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.260]  Yep.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:00.580]  RCS.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.800]  We should end this podcast.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:03.600]  Yep.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:05.300]  I've been having fun doing it, though.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.080]  I'm enjoying it.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.080]  I'm having fun, too.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.720]  I just I don't think we need...
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.780]  Once again, I have it enabled.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.640]  I've disabled it and now I'm enabled.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.020]  30 minutes of Geoff tech support in this podcast.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:16.700]  You need to restart your phone and then that'll fix it.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:18.840]  Speaking of tech support, Andrew, what are we doing tech support?
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.880]  Uh, Friday, we're doing Sloppy Joe's.
[01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.180]  Oh, yep.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.820]  Oh, we should stop this podcast.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.460]  But I wanted to...
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.320]  I wanted to...
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:37.340]  Andrew's going to give you some sort of a lame answer and not actually schedule it.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.000]  But there is something I do want to schedule that I think you guys will want to do.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.160]  I came up with an idea for a new draft I wanted to throw your way.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:43.700]  Sidekick draft.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.040]  That's good.
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:45.900]  I'll put it in the list.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.360]  We have our next two lined up.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.700]  Are we adding that to the mix?
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.680]  No, we'll do it on a different one.
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.720]  Yeah, we'll do it on a different one.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:52.520]  But just put it in the queue.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.700]  Sidekicks, best sidekicks.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.980]  I'm putting it in the list.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:58.160]  Oh, man.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:17:59.380]  OK.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.660]  All right, well, there you go.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.160]  We should wrap this up.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:02.540]  Yeah.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.440]  Andrew, you were about to take us out, I think you said.
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:04.960]  Yep.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.100]  Once again, this is another shit-filled, disgusting,
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.100]  Geoff Has a Problem podcast brought to you by us.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.240]  Check out our Patreon, The Regulation Pod.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.820]  Everybody got Dilly Bars except Eric, because I don't know where he lives.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.040]  He also doesn't compete, so I wouldn't buy one for him anyway.
[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.160]  I'm not going to do anything for him.
[01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:23.980]  Yeah.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:25.160]  Go ahead.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.040]  Yeah.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.800]  And you can check out at patreon.com slash The Regulation Pod with a free membership.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.240]  You can watch Mario Party March every day in March.
[01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.000]  And then at the end of the month, we'll have it in a full video on our gameplay channel.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.240]  So go check it out, because I feel like we said Mario Party March,
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.740]  but didn't talk about the details.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.620]  Those are the details.
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.560]  I cannot wait.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.040]  We start tomorrow.
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:48.920]  It's our first day.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:50.520]  I'm so excited.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.300]  Are you going to order the donuts tonight?
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.560]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.360]  You know, well, now I made up for it.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.260]  I ordered the other stuff.
[01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:56.580]  I'm fine.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:56.800]  Okay.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:57.980]  I'm fine.
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.800]  Could you could you text them and make sure I'm fine?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:01.800]  I think I'm fine.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.780]  Geoff will do it.
[01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.120]  All right.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:05.700]  See you next time.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.120]  Bye.
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.180]  Bye.
