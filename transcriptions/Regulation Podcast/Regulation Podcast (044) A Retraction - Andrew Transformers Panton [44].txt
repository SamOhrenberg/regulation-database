[00:00.000 --> 00:03.380]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.640 --> 00:04.800]  This is episode 44.
[00:05.020 --> 00:10.220]  My name is Geoff. With me, as always, Eric, Andrew, Gavin and Nick.
[00:10.380 --> 00:12.200]  I'm going nicknameless this week.
[00:12.280 --> 00:14.020]  We're going to go back to... we're just doing first names today.
[00:14.580 --> 00:15.960]  And what was the point of the nicknames?
[00:16.600 --> 00:20.700]  A nickname is there when you want to use it, but you don't always use it.
[00:20.740 --> 00:22.100]  You don't want to overuse it.
[00:22.240 --> 00:24.680]  We didn't overuse our nicknames last year.
[00:25.140 --> 00:25.820]  That's a great point.
[00:26.260 --> 00:27.660]  I was hoping you would use it. So.
[00:28.500 --> 00:31.980]  Well, just to see if you keep calling Nick the Mechanic or the Mechanic.
[00:32.200 --> 00:32.760]  Oh, yeah.
[00:32.860 --> 00:34.020]  Some people don't like that.
[00:34.120 --> 00:37.280]  I call him the Mechanic and they think that I've got it wrong somehow
[00:37.280 --> 00:39.000]  and that I'm not doing it on purpose.
[00:39.320 --> 00:42.680]  I think Mechanic is so much cooler than Mechanic.
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.620]  Mechanic is a dude named Nick who fixes cars.
[00:46.080 --> 00:49.880]  Mechanic is a giant robot named Nick who fixes cars.
[00:50.000 --> 00:50.580]  Hell yeah!
[00:51.360 --> 00:52.100]  That's right.
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.140]  I imagine him as just Nick as he is now, a normal human man,
[00:56.140 --> 00:59.360]  but with one of those wind up things sticking out of his back.
[00:59.540 --> 01:00.380]  You know what, though?
[01:00.920 --> 01:02.280]  Oh, I like that, too.
[01:02.360 --> 01:05.060]  But for some reason, he has Oakley razor blades on.
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.180]  Yeah, he's got the wind up in his back and then Oakley razor blades on.
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.360]  He's like, that's his.
[01:11.600 --> 01:12.660]  I don't know why it's his robot look.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.200]  Maybe we can get in the lab and make Nick a backpack
[01:15.200 --> 01:17.040]  that looks like one of those wind up keys.
[01:17.680 --> 01:19.880]  Oh, he can only wear it if he has the boots on.
[01:20.420 --> 01:22.300]  Yeah, he's got he's got to be wearing the boots.
[01:22.440 --> 01:25.520]  You can't be making him cool fashion items before he wears the boots.
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.660]  Mecha Nick is powered by red boots.
[01:28.160 --> 01:30.680]  Yeah, well, wind him up and he'll just plod around in the boots.
[01:31.880 --> 01:32.520]  Key, right?
[01:32.660 --> 01:34.540]  It's always a key in the back for some reason.
[01:35.440 --> 01:37.080]  Yeah. Are those what you were picturing, Geoff?
[01:37.660 --> 01:38.840]  Yes. Oakley razor blades.
[01:39.120 --> 01:39.440]  Just making sure.
[01:39.780 --> 01:41.500]  Just making sure we were on the same page.
[01:42.060 --> 01:43.520]  Yeah. Like 80s
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.820]  tough guy glasses.
[01:46.700 --> 01:47.760]  80s tough guy glasses.
[01:48.200 --> 01:49.060]  All right, my server's off.
[01:49.620 --> 01:51.840]  Oh, cool. Right on.
[01:52.440 --> 01:53.160]  Good to have you back.
[01:53.300 --> 01:54.480]  Hey, good to have you back, man.
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.520]  Hey, before we get going too far today, I need to do something I rarely do.
[01:59.620 --> 02:03.860]  And I hate to do it, but I got to do it because God damn it, I'm a man of integrity.
[02:04.320 --> 02:06.420]  I need to issue a partial retraction.
[02:06.960 --> 02:10.520]  Oh, I I did something that I don't do.
[02:10.840 --> 02:12.640]  I listened to last week's episode.
[02:13.220 --> 02:16.160]  Oh, and now and I realized why I don't do it,
[02:16.160 --> 02:19.740]  because there is nothing worse than hearing me fuck up a story.
[02:20.240 --> 02:24.840]  This is I fucked up the beginning of that gross story yesterday
[02:24.840 --> 02:28.820]  in similar similar ways to how I fucked up the horse down the mountain.
[02:29.220 --> 02:33.460]  And I'm I've been so mad at myself
[02:33.460 --> 02:36.240]  ever since I was just driving in the car yesterday with Emily.
[02:36.300 --> 02:38.280]  And I was like, oh, let's I'll turn it on. Listen to it.
[02:38.720 --> 02:40.760]  Two seconds in, I was like, I'm going to fucking kill myself.
[02:40.780 --> 02:43.700]  I can't believe I blew it so badly.
[02:43.800 --> 02:48.160]  I start off the story by talking about Emily's getting nauseous. Right.
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.180]  And I'm like, oh, like two in the morning, she wakes up and that didn't happen.
[02:51.340 --> 02:54.540]  That I conflated that because I was in a rush to get the story out.
[02:54.560 --> 02:56.920]  And I hadn't like worked through the story beats in my head
[02:56.920 --> 02:59.680]  because telling the story takes a little bit of work and preparation.
[02:59.980 --> 03:01.180]  And you want to get it right.
[03:01.260 --> 03:03.140]  You know, you got to you got to find the right
[03:03.140 --> 03:04.900]  I don't know, the right cadence to tell it.
[03:05.020 --> 03:08.420]  And so I was a little rushed into the story and I just short circuited part of it.
[03:08.640 --> 03:11.520]  She didn't get sick at two in the morning and then get up and throw up.
[03:11.720 --> 03:12.540]  That's what I did.
[03:12.620 --> 03:14.880]  And I gave that to her as well as to me.
[03:14.880 --> 03:18.840]  What actually happened is we were in line for Space Mountain at like 6 p.m.
[03:18.840 --> 03:21.360]  And she looked at me and she said, I don't think I can be in this line anymore.
[03:21.720 --> 03:22.580]  And I'm like, what does that mean?
[03:22.580 --> 03:23.780]  She's like, I don't think I feel well.
[03:23.960 --> 03:26.460]  And so we left left Burndog and Vanessa in the line.
[03:26.540 --> 03:30.200]  And we went and sat down on a like a bench for like 15 minutes.
[03:30.200 --> 03:32.340]  And then she said, we have got to go back to the hotel.
[03:32.540 --> 03:34.780]  So then she's like, I'm going to be sick.
[03:34.860 --> 03:36.540]  And so she was like holding it in.
[03:36.660 --> 03:38.040]  We walk out of Disneyland.
[03:38.220 --> 03:40.340]  I don't know if you've walked out of Disneyland lately.
[03:40.560 --> 03:42.160]  It's about a half an hour process
[03:42.740 --> 03:44.820]  to get to the Uber stand.
[03:45.020 --> 03:46.100]  And then we get into an Uber.
[03:46.480 --> 03:48.500]  And this is what I feel the worst about,
[03:48.540 --> 03:50.340]  because this is probably the funniest part of the story.
[03:50.460 --> 03:51.380]  We get into the Uber.
[03:51.880 --> 03:54.620]  Emily just like puts her head against the window because she's like
[03:54.620 --> 03:57.780]  and just is like holding her tummy, you know, like trying to get through this.
[03:58.060 --> 04:00.520]  And it's three miles to the hotel.
[04:00.660 --> 04:03.460]  It's the Westin, but it's 6 p.m. on a Friday.
[04:03.540 --> 04:07.600]  So it takes 36 minutes to get there because of just like literally
[04:07.600 --> 04:10.140]  sitting at stoplights, not being able to go because of pedestrians
[04:10.140 --> 04:12.060]  just crossing the street constantly, you know.
[04:12.060 --> 04:13.220]  And not paying attention to traffic laws.
[04:13.760 --> 04:17.800]  And so in that fucking Uber, the guy goes,
[04:18.340 --> 04:19.800]  Hey, is your first trip to Disneyland?
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.060]  We're like, oh, man, it's been a long day.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.760]  Not feeling well. My wife's feeling a little sick.
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.100]  He's like, oh, yeah, that happens if you.
[04:25.400 --> 04:26.680]  Yeah, it's a little bit too much sex. That's right.
[04:26.720 --> 04:29.500]  And he just goes, it's like, oh, my wife and I moved here last week.
[04:29.540 --> 04:31.680]  We just took our daughter to Disney for the first time last week.
[04:31.780 --> 04:32.740]  What was your favorite ride?
[04:33.000 --> 04:33.880]  How long are you here for?
[04:33.920 --> 04:35.240]  And I'm like, we're just here for two days.
[04:35.280 --> 04:37.180]  It's like, oh, yeah, a lot of people are here for a week.
[04:37.180 --> 04:39.100]  And I'm like, what are you doing for the whole week?
[04:39.300 --> 04:39.560]  How do you know?
[04:39.560 --> 04:41.160]  And he just keeps going and he won't stop.
[04:41.780 --> 04:42.780]  Eventually, he dies down.
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.020]  But his music is playing and he's playing like,
[04:46.640 --> 04:48.980]  I don't know, something Jeremy would like, maybe like
[04:49.880 --> 04:52.280]  not Linkin Park, but something like that.
[04:52.360 --> 04:53.140]  That's so funny.
[04:53.340 --> 04:55.920]  You know, I don't I don't I don't know the bands like Breaking Benjamin
[04:55.920 --> 05:01.740]  or like Sad Melissa or like Bloody Bloody Steve or like, I don't know,
[05:01.780 --> 05:06.480]  something like 2010, like medley rock nonsense that I just don't get.
[05:06.560 --> 05:07.980]  And it's fucking blaring.
[05:08.300 --> 05:09.020]  It's just going constantly.
[05:09.020 --> 05:13.360]  And this motherfucker, to be cool and to be the fun Uber has
[05:14.920 --> 05:18.800]  has installed rows of LEDs on his dashboard
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.780]  and on the side of the car, like, you know, where you roll the windows down
[05:22.780 --> 05:25.620]  and then under the seats and under the dashboard.
[05:25.820 --> 05:29.280]  And they change colors rapidly to the music.
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.660]  So it's like yellow, red, blue, red, red, red, red, green, red, red.
[05:32.740 --> 05:35.760]  Well, the music is blaring and the guy's like going like, oh, you got to try.
[05:35.960 --> 05:37.880]  Yeah, you got to go on Pirates of the Caribbean.
[05:38.280 --> 05:39.900]  My three year old loved it.
[05:39.920 --> 05:40.440]  That was a funny.
[05:40.540 --> 05:43.280]  And and Emily's just like whimpering in the corner.
[05:43.280 --> 05:45.300]  And then finally we get there and we pull out.
[05:45.320 --> 05:48.140]  And then I she barely makes it to the hotel room before she gets sick.
[05:48.160 --> 05:50.060]  But I don't know why I miss that part of the story.
[05:50.080 --> 05:51.680]  And I just fucking hate myself for doing it.
[05:51.740 --> 05:54.800]  And I got to go back to not listening, because I'd rather not know that I suck
[05:54.800 --> 05:57.360]  than be confronted with my own shittiness.
[05:57.840 --> 06:01.940]  I'm imagining you and Emily just on the Wankatania mania thing
[06:02.640 --> 06:06.400]  where it's all the lights and Gene Wilder's just chat a bunch of shit.
[06:06.400 --> 06:08.140]  Try not to vomit.
[06:09.120 --> 06:10.580]  I felt so bad for her.
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.140]  And then I felt so bad about me because I fucked that part of the story up.
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.360]  Anyway, that's my retraction.
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.420]  Yeah, that's my retraction.
[06:17.460 --> 06:17.740]  That's great.
[06:18.260 --> 06:19.880]  Yeah, I have a.
[06:20.180 --> 06:21.120]  Oh, you have a retraction too?
[06:21.200 --> 06:21.780]  I've got one after you.
[06:21.800 --> 06:22.620]  I don't have a retraction.
[06:22.780 --> 06:24.240]  I have more of a I made a mistake.
[06:24.860 --> 06:26.200]  Not so much a retraction.
[06:26.760 --> 06:30.640]  As far as you reminded me, us talking about the nicknames also reminded me
[06:31.080 --> 06:32.860]  we did the nicknames pick thing.
[06:33.240 --> 06:34.760]  And in the nicknames pick,
[06:34.760 --> 06:38.700]  I suggested Geoff as your nickname, Boss Dog,
[06:39.820 --> 06:43.700]  because Boss Hog character in Dallas, I felt very strongly.
[06:43.700 --> 06:44.420]  I let it go.
[06:44.840 --> 06:46.960]  I let go proud of myself for that.
[06:47.420 --> 06:51.860]  And I realized maybe four days ago that it is a Dukes of Hazzard's character.
[06:52.140 --> 06:53.260]  Yeah, Boss Hog, really?
[06:53.840 --> 06:56.400]  Boss Hog, his name's not Boss Dog either.
[06:56.480 --> 06:57.120]  It's Boss Hog.
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.540]  He is a he's the I guess like the mayor of Hazard County.
[07:01.640 --> 07:04.740]  I knew it was Boss Hog, but I thought, oh, Boss Hog, he's in Dallas.
[07:04.740 --> 07:08.760]  And then I Googled Boss Hog and he just looks like he should be in Dallas.
[07:08.940 --> 07:09.940]  I mean, look at that man.
[07:10.020 --> 07:11.720]  That looks like a Dallas ass man to me.
[07:11.880 --> 07:13.100]  That's the Dallas flag, right?
[07:13.640 --> 07:15.380]  I'm pretty sure it's the Dallas flag.
[07:16.120 --> 07:17.940]  You can't be more Dallas than Boss.
[07:18.480 --> 07:19.620]  Boss Hog, Boss Dog.
[07:20.140 --> 07:22.100]  Shit. Have we ever done a villain's draft?
[07:22.480 --> 07:23.580]  Oh, villain's draft is good.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.640]  I'll put it on the I'll put it on the sheet.
[07:25.740 --> 07:26.620]  We've done villain deaths.
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.160]  I don't know. We've done villain deaths.
[07:28.240 --> 07:29.780]  I don't know what draft we need.
[07:29.900 --> 07:33.320]  We it makes sense for Boss Hog, but we need to put Boss Hog in a draft.
[07:33.320 --> 07:34.580]  He is entertaining.
[07:34.900 --> 07:36.720]  Yeah, that's that's really good.
[07:37.200 --> 07:40.340]  And before we get too far away from it, I just wanted to make a Bloody Steve logo
[07:42.060 --> 07:43.080]  I thought fit.
[07:43.220 --> 07:44.860]  So a big Bloody Steve guy.
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.480]  They were huge like in 2014.
[07:46.840 --> 07:47.420]  Yeah, it's them.
[07:47.600 --> 07:49.720]  I think they were on tour with Bring Me the Horizon.
[07:50.180 --> 07:51.560]  And you could go see Bloody Steve.
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.220]  They didn't have any hits, but good for them.
[07:53.340 --> 07:56.300]  They were so close to getting the end of Transformers song.
[07:56.360 --> 07:58.120]  They were second. They were right there.
[08:00.740 --> 08:02.240]  Only people could have heard it.
[08:05.020 --> 08:05.820]  Oh, Christ.
[08:05.820 --> 08:08.280]  That looks like bloody Steve.
[08:08.620 --> 08:09.140]  Yeah, bloody.
[08:09.500 --> 08:13.480]  Yeah, well, that I mean, that that's a pretty light like metal font.
[08:13.540 --> 08:16.600]  You get crazier like metal fonts are so nuts.
[08:16.640 --> 08:17.880]  They go way crazier than that.
[08:18.120 --> 08:20.960]  One of my favorite things to do is when I'm hanging out with Burn Dog
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.420]  and we're in public is making him decipher those for me and show me
[08:24.420 --> 08:27.180]  where the letters are, dude, because I can read good at it.
[08:27.420 --> 08:28.820]  He's yeah, he knows all of it.
[08:28.880 --> 08:32.860]  He knows every fucking black metal death metal war metal
[08:33.320 --> 08:38.080]  War Chord, Dick Chord, Killsmith Chord band on Earth.
[08:38.280 --> 08:39.340]  He can he can read it all.
[08:39.560 --> 08:43.100]  What's that band that it's like 28,000 letters
[08:43.100 --> 08:46.160]  and it's a big acronym for something I'm talking about?
[08:46.940 --> 08:51.460]  It's like a really disturbing string of words, but shortened into just letters.
[08:52.040 --> 08:52.500]  I don't know.
[08:52.500 --> 08:53.140]  I have no clue.
[08:53.660 --> 08:54.340]  How I Met Your Mother?
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.640]  My little retraction is when I was talking about the CT scan,
[09:01.640 --> 09:05.700]  the Venogram thing, I it sounded like when I listened to it back
[09:05.700 --> 09:09.540]  that they injected the contrast directly into my brain.
[09:10.000 --> 09:10.940]  That's not the case.
[09:11.040 --> 09:11.160]  They did.
[09:12.560 --> 09:14.580]  It was injected just into my arm.
[09:14.980 --> 09:17.580]  That's so much less cool and freaky.
[09:18.120 --> 09:20.040]  I don't know how you inject something directly.
[09:20.300 --> 09:22.020]  Would they have stabbed me in the temple?
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.100]  I don't know how that worked.
[09:23.440 --> 09:26.340]  I was imagining every movie I've seen where they do brain stuff
[09:26.340 --> 09:30.320]  where there's a big tarp covering the front and they're there in the back
[09:30.320 --> 09:31.000]  and they're going in.
[09:31.000 --> 09:35.420]  Now, the contrast was in my arm and then they look at the veins in my brain,
[09:35.820 --> 09:38.080]  but it's done through the arm.
[09:38.240 --> 09:41.140]  Did people really think they stuck like a needle in your brain?
[09:41.240 --> 09:41.660]  I did.
[09:41.940 --> 09:45.920]  Apparently, it had to be 50-50.
[09:46.060 --> 09:48.500]  I just wanted to clarify that I didn't have a needle through my head.
[09:48.620 --> 09:49.840]  That's so much less cool.
[09:50.100 --> 09:52.020]  Oh, man, I don't like that retraction.
[09:52.260 --> 09:53.460]  That's almost lame.
[09:53.600 --> 09:56.360]  If somebody sticks a needle in any of our heads,
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.500]  that's going to be an hour and a half conversation alone just on the process.
[10:00.500 --> 10:02.120]  Like, that's an insanity.
[10:02.320 --> 10:04.480]  If you thought that, why wouldn't you?
[10:04.740 --> 10:06.360]  Why wouldn't you have more questions about that bit?
[10:06.820 --> 10:08.820]  Doctor stuff. I don't know. It's above my pay grade.
[10:09.300 --> 10:10.100]  Oh, my God.
[10:10.500 --> 10:13.980]  But, you know, it's like you're you're sharing like a medical thing as well.
[10:14.040 --> 10:17.040]  So it's like I don't want to necessarily ask additional questions.
[10:17.180 --> 10:18.920]  I feel like you should be in that.
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.500]  So it's like it's yeah, you you said it.
[10:21.520 --> 10:23.700]  I interpreted it. I really enjoyed it.
[10:24.140 --> 10:26.220]  And now I got to know it was just through your arm.
[10:26.300 --> 10:26.740]  That's that's cool.
[10:27.220 --> 10:29.440]  Yeah. Well, yeah, I didn't think it was cool.
[10:30.960 --> 10:34.060]  Well, I just thought you going through that was cool.
[10:34.440 --> 10:37.300]  If you're going to have to go through something where they're like
[10:37.300 --> 10:40.880]  checking your brain or whatever, the idea that you're in like face off
[10:40.880 --> 10:44.660]  and they got the needle in the box, that that is sort of what I was imagining
[10:44.660 --> 10:47.600]  is like the face scene and face off when they swap faces.
[10:47.940 --> 10:50.060]  You thought I was going through some like severance procedure?
[10:50.460 --> 10:52.100]  Yes, exactly.
[10:52.500 --> 10:56.220]  It's funny you mentioned getting a CT scan because I just had one
[10:56.220 --> 10:58.560]  about 90 minutes ago. Oh, damn.
[10:58.560 --> 11:03.240]  Yeah, brain, jaw, face, teeth.
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.620]  Yeah, I have an impossible to solve or find
[11:08.540 --> 11:11.500]  problem in my head that they just they cannot diagnose.
[11:11.700 --> 11:14.100]  But it's not teeth related. It is 100% not.
[11:14.200 --> 11:16.420]  I don't need a root canal that's been ruled out.
[11:16.480 --> 11:18.280]  But yeah, I just just got phantom pain.
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.340]  I might have to get Botox in my masseter muscle now.
[11:22.440 --> 11:24.440]  Oh, oh, classic masseter.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.560]  Yeah, I think what would fix your pain?
[11:27.560 --> 11:30.460]  And I'm I'm like 70% joking.
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.760]  I think one of you guys, Eric, Gavin, Nick, at some point
[11:34.760 --> 11:37.480]  should just hit Geoff over the head with a steel chair.
[11:37.680 --> 11:39.180]  And I think that might help.
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.580]  Maybe maybe instead of that, I like where you go with that.
[11:42.660 --> 11:47.200]  The pain is on the left side of my jaw, like above my my my back molar.
[11:47.740 --> 11:50.360]  What if they hit the right side of my head?
[11:50.400 --> 11:52.060]  Really? It's like in roughly the same place.
[11:52.100 --> 11:53.500]  You think it would even it out?
[11:53.580 --> 11:54.660]  I think it could even it out.
[11:54.780 --> 11:56.120]  It has to be by surprise.
[11:56.120 --> 11:57.560]  You can't know it's coming.
[11:57.960 --> 12:01.140]  It's got to be like a beanhole situation where like you look down
[12:01.140 --> 12:04.460]  to open the beanhole in the back steel chair side of the head.
[12:04.680 --> 12:06.080]  You instantly feel better.
[12:06.280 --> 12:07.500]  That that's what we'll do.
[12:07.900 --> 12:11.740]  Yeah, this is this is good because Gavin will walk up to you
[12:11.740 --> 12:14.440]  with the steel chair and you're like, oh, I see you.
[12:14.560 --> 12:16.880]  And then I tap you on the shoulder.
[12:16.980 --> 12:20.040]  You turn around, boom, boom, I hit you with the steel chair.
[12:20.080 --> 12:23.420]  And then me and Gavin raise our steel chairs in the air as new champion.
[12:23.420 --> 12:27.780]  How about then when I'm on the ground and incapacitated,
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.280]  you inject contrast directly into my brain?
[12:35.280 --> 12:37.180]  Now, this is a plan I like.
[12:37.440 --> 12:39.460]  Now we're off the chairs.
[12:39.880 --> 12:41.680]  Yeah, you can eat the beanhole beans.
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.400]  And Nick is just going to film all of it and have some beanhole beans.
[12:46.900 --> 12:47.820]  Just enjoying life.
[12:47.960 --> 12:51.200]  And I want to have beanhole beans, but good ones.
[12:51.200 --> 12:54.080]  You know, I want to go to that beanhole days this year if we can.
[12:54.420 --> 12:55.760]  Do you think they're going to be good beans?
[12:56.280 --> 12:58.400]  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so.
[12:58.780 --> 13:00.960]  Fuck you. Come on with the nay saying.
[13:01.040 --> 13:02.460]  Of course they're going to be good beans.
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.180]  This is the epicenter of beanhole beaning.
[13:05.280 --> 13:06.780]  These are the people that do it the best.
[13:07.120 --> 13:10.840]  I just I remember Anthony Bourdain saying that like places
[13:10.840 --> 13:13.640]  that are known for specific food are never the best at it.
[13:13.880 --> 13:16.680]  That that's just exactly what I was in my head for.
[13:16.700 --> 13:18.060]  Exactly what I was thinking, Andrew.
[13:18.140 --> 13:20.160]  It just doesn't feel like it's going to be the thing.
[13:20.200 --> 13:20.820]  But that's just me.
[13:20.820 --> 13:22.060]  But not play.
[13:22.320 --> 13:23.060]  I understand what you're saying.
[13:23.160 --> 13:24.300]  Places are known for a certain food.
[13:24.480 --> 13:28.140]  But what if it's the only place that's known for that food?
[13:28.520 --> 13:30.920]  It's not like there's competing beanhole areas.
[13:31.020 --> 13:34.540]  This is it. This is like this is the beanhole hole.
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.120]  This is the hole where all the beans come from.
[13:37.480 --> 13:38.380]  There are no other.
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.880]  It's not it's not like somebody in Wisconsin has been as a beanhole
[13:42.880 --> 13:44.100]  and they're like, no, ours is the best.
[13:44.140 --> 13:45.440]  And somebody else is like, no, ours is the best.
[13:45.440 --> 13:46.320]  Like Sloppy Joe's or something.
[13:46.540 --> 13:49.320]  This is the only one place that claims beans.
[13:49.840 --> 13:51.840]  I don't know why my brain went here, but why?
[13:51.960 --> 13:55.940]  What if what if beanhole beans are like the Peter Molyneux of food?
[13:56.160 --> 13:57.720]  What if they're just none of them are good?
[13:58.060 --> 13:59.200]  What if none of it is good?
[13:59.620 --> 14:00.560]  Populous was good.
[14:00.920 --> 14:01.940]  Populous was good.
[14:02.380 --> 14:04.120]  No, I'm Fable's good. I love Fable.
[14:04.380 --> 14:06.960]  My point is, though, is that Peter Molyneux always talks about
[14:06.960 --> 14:10.540]  how amazing these experiences are going to be and they'll at best be good.
[14:10.580 --> 14:12.100]  But they're never what he says.
[14:12.140 --> 14:16.060]  Like, what if we're chasing this very specific thing
[14:16.060 --> 14:19.520]  that just isn't ever what we think it is?
[14:20.220 --> 14:22.520]  Maybe we have to come to terms with beanhole beans are just OK.
[14:23.040 --> 14:25.220]  What are the best beans like outside of the hole?
[14:26.000 --> 14:26.980]  Outside of the hole?
[14:27.140 --> 14:27.540]  Baked beans?
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.060]  Either these beans come outside of the hole.
[14:30.580 --> 14:31.180]  I like baked beans.
[14:31.440 --> 14:34.540]  If you could make a can of Heinz baked beans in a hole,
[14:35.140 --> 14:36.040]  they would be great beans.
[14:36.600 --> 14:39.440]  Yeah, I think they would be just as good as they were
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.480]  in a different environment, like just standard bean making.
[14:42.480 --> 14:50.240]  No, because they're slow roasting with like a ham hock or bacon fat over 24-48 hours.
[14:50.620 --> 14:55.020]  They're being prepared in such a way to make them more tender and flavorful.
[14:55.400 --> 14:58.660]  It's it's the process is what makes it good.
[14:59.020 --> 15:02.740]  This is not. And by the way, you're also you're you're allowed to be disappointed
[15:02.740 --> 15:07.300]  by Peter Molyneux because he made such fucking hits that you fell in love with him.
[15:07.320 --> 15:09.880]  Right. This is Peter Molyneux, not some
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.940]  like snake oil salesman going from town to town.
[15:13.140 --> 15:17.080]  He's a guy who built some of the greatest video game experiences you've had.
[15:17.440 --> 15:23.520]  Right. He let you down with everything post-Fable because Fable was so fucking great.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.600]  No, I don't think that.
[15:26.080 --> 15:30.260]  I really like Fable, but I think Peter Molyneux's whole career is sort of that.
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.960]  Populous was a perfect game.
[15:32.360 --> 15:34.180]  Fable one and two were perfect games.
[15:34.320 --> 15:36.000]  Fable three was better than everybody said.
[15:36.200 --> 15:37.720]  And then he fell off a cliff.
[15:37.720 --> 15:39.340]  But those games. But that's why.
[15:39.640 --> 15:42.700]  But that's why it hurts that he fell off that cliff, because those other games
[15:42.700 --> 15:43.780]  were fucking great, man.
[15:43.860 --> 15:47.920]  But even Fable, there were things that he's like, you're going to be able to do this.
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.440]  And then it's just it's nowhere close.
[15:49.900 --> 15:52.620]  It's not even reflective of the experience as good as Fable is.
[15:52.900 --> 15:56.760]  So you're describing every video game developer, describing every video game
[15:56.760 --> 15:57.980]  of all time. It's a different.
[15:58.120 --> 16:00.340]  You're you're making a weird argument for Peter Molyneux.
[16:00.460 --> 16:01.880]  That is this is his thing.
[16:02.380 --> 16:06.260]  He states he is very ambitious in his selling of what this thing is.
[16:07.580 --> 16:10.640]  And it's never quite that as good as those experiences are.
[16:10.780 --> 16:14.040]  I love Fable. Although they are Sean Murray guy.
[16:14.120 --> 16:15.280]  Is that his name? No Man's Sky guy.
[16:15.640 --> 16:18.120]  He did that. But then he's kind of then he worked.
[16:18.240 --> 16:19.380]  Delivered on it. Worked to get it.
[16:19.600 --> 16:20.540]  Decade. It was crazy.
[16:20.860 --> 16:22.060]  Yeah. He never stopped.
[16:22.340 --> 16:23.060]  I'm not going to.
[16:23.180 --> 16:23.800]  I'm not going to.
[16:23.900 --> 16:27.440]  I'm not going to unfairly fault Peter Molyneux for overhyping shit
[16:27.440 --> 16:29.620]  when cliffy bees of the world exist.
[16:29.700 --> 16:33.340]  It's not like Peter Molyneux is the only dude in our space that's doing this.
[16:33.760 --> 16:34.740]  Everyone does this.
[16:34.740 --> 16:36.780]  I think it's a different level.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.760]  Can you eat beans in Fable?
[16:38.880 --> 16:40.740]  Because I looked up No Man's Sky has beans.
[16:41.060 --> 16:42.740]  So I'm just. Does it really?
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.480]  Yeah. Should we go through video games and find the best video game beans?
[16:46.820 --> 16:49.120]  That might be good. Let us know in the comments.
[16:49.240 --> 16:51.980]  If you're listening to this, let us know what games we should be looking at,
[16:52.020 --> 16:53.760]  which beans are the best in each game.
[16:54.560 --> 16:55.340]  That'll help us.
[16:55.680 --> 16:57.300]  I realize I'm arguing for Peter Molyneux.
[16:57.360 --> 16:58.460]  I don't really want to defend that dude.
[16:58.520 --> 16:59.800]  I really don't give a shit about Peter Molyneux.
[16:59.840 --> 17:01.220]  But I do care about beans.
[17:01.460 --> 17:03.440]  And like he's become a bean proxy.
[17:03.440 --> 17:07.320]  I think that the beans at the Pequot Lakes Beanhole Days
[17:07.320 --> 17:10.660]  are going to be better beans than anything you've ever put in your entire
[17:10.660 --> 17:14.040]  fucking body ever throughout the course of your life.
[17:14.080 --> 17:16.320]  And I'm willing to bet real money on it.
[17:16.600 --> 17:19.580]  Well, what's funny is that Peter Molyneux has a bean connection
[17:20.080 --> 17:25.060]  or his first business was shipping baked beans to the Middle East
[17:25.060 --> 17:26.640]  was his first business endeavor.
[17:26.920 --> 17:29.480]  And he got into video games. Are you serious?
[17:30.020 --> 17:33.260]  Yes. Well, I've talked I think I've talked about this on the show.
[17:33.440 --> 17:35.040]  At least I've told you this before,
[17:36.260 --> 17:37.960]  but he was shipping.
[17:38.100 --> 17:40.720]  He's trying to ship baked beans is like, Oh, they don't have this.
[17:40.920 --> 17:41.640]  They're going to love it.
[17:41.700 --> 17:45.820]  Wasn't going well, but his company was happened to be named
[17:45.820 --> 17:48.820]  the same as a electronics manufacturer.
[17:49.100 --> 17:53.200]  And Atari mistook him for the electronics manufacturer.
[17:53.600 --> 17:55.520]  And then he just lied that he was them.
[17:55.940 --> 17:59.460]  And that's how he got his entry into video games is his company
[17:59.460 --> 18:03.220]  became like the distributor in Europe for Atari products.
[18:03.440 --> 18:06.000]  Yeah, apparently lying gets you pretty far in this world somehow.
[18:06.140 --> 18:07.500]  Yeah. Yeah.
[18:08.860 --> 18:10.820]  He he's a wild character.
[18:10.980 --> 18:13.160]  I love Peter Molyneux, but ridiculous.
[18:13.740 --> 18:14.860]  He's going to have an A.I.
[18:14.900 --> 18:17.140]  Kinect boy make bean hole beans for you.
[18:17.180 --> 18:17.880]  And it's going to be delicious.
[18:18.680 --> 18:21.420]  I found an article that says Peter Molyneux regrets.
[18:21.840 --> 18:23.760]  He says he regrets over promising on his games.
[18:24.360 --> 18:26.620]  What I should have said in every interview is
[18:27.200 --> 18:31.180]  everything I say, take with a pinch of salt, which is a great
[18:31.180 --> 18:33.600]  actual recipe for beans.
[18:34.160 --> 18:34.780]  Yeah, pinch of salt.
[18:35.880 --> 18:37.720]  So everything is bean related.
[18:38.200 --> 18:43.440]  Speaking of like weird like logos to interpret and kind of the game space.
[18:43.660 --> 18:48.080]  I just learned that a claim is two C's and that fucked me up.
[18:49.260 --> 18:50.080]  Oh, that's not a K.
[18:50.420 --> 18:51.400]  I thought it was K.
[18:51.800 --> 18:53.660]  No, it's two C's. What are you talking about?
[18:53.940 --> 18:55.300]  Are you serious?
[18:55.640 --> 18:58.360]  Yeah. If you if I think the K there is a K there.
[18:58.360 --> 19:01.980]  If you look at the the right side of the A and the next C, it looks like a K.
[19:02.100 --> 19:02.940]  So maybe you just like.
[19:03.100 --> 19:04.820]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I visualize it.
[19:04.900 --> 19:06.100]  Yeah, dude, I agree.
[19:06.220 --> 19:08.560]  If you just like look at stuff wrong, it's wrong.
[19:08.640 --> 19:09.540]  I agree. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:09.860 --> 19:13.040]  If you give if you make the A a different letter, sure.
[19:13.060 --> 19:13.920]  You could make a K.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.920]  You guys all were aware of the case C situation that it sees.
[19:18.140 --> 19:20.900]  Yeah. I've never looked at it and thought these were K's.
[19:20.940 --> 19:21.800]  I've always looked at it.
[19:21.900 --> 19:22.500]  And I've seen these.
[19:22.740 --> 19:27.560]  Have you ever read an online article with the word acclaim in it?
[19:27.560 --> 19:28.380]  No, I don't think so.
[19:28.420 --> 19:32.220]  I think I've only seen the logo on the joystick or fucking Kotaku
[19:32.220 --> 19:34.180]  or any website at any point.
[19:34.180 --> 19:36.860]  I have, but I don't feel like a claim is like
[19:37.280 --> 19:39.780]  I don't think they're really around all that much anymore.
[19:39.840 --> 19:41.380]  Like the whole thing came back.
[19:41.920 --> 19:44.280]  Yeah, that's why I learned about the double C's.
[19:44.640 --> 19:46.300]  You went acclaim. Who's that?
[19:46.380 --> 19:48.180]  I'm only I'm only familiar with the claim.
[19:50.140 --> 19:51.560]  They were a big bean and poor.
[19:54.220 --> 19:57.100]  I yeah, I'm always slightly scared when I side
[19:57.100 --> 20:00.160]  with Andrew, but yeah, I definitely assume there was a K involved somewhere there.
[20:00.440 --> 20:01.880]  It's not important, I guess.
[20:02.000 --> 20:02.580]  You just read that.
[20:02.700 --> 20:04.840]  You're like, oh, yeah, you just move on with your life.
[20:05.980 --> 20:07.620]  You never really get into it.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.600]  Yeah, that was my big reveal.
[20:11.480 --> 20:14.920]  When you think about businesses that are selling through the roof,
[20:14.940 --> 20:19.140]  like Allbirds or Skims, you only see the front part of that.
[20:19.320 --> 20:21.280]  You know, like you see the big successful business.
[20:21.500 --> 20:23.700]  And I mean, it's across this in like any industry.
[20:23.860 --> 20:26.120]  You see the results of their success.
[20:26.120 --> 20:29.660]  But what you need to remember is that there's always something
[20:29.660 --> 20:34.120]  or someone in the background that is enabling that success.
[20:34.460 --> 20:36.980]  And that is what Shopify is for businesses.
[20:37.240 --> 20:40.100]  It is the thing that is giving support to those businesses
[20:40.100 --> 20:44.080]  and allowing them to achieve those goals and the success that they have.
[20:44.500 --> 20:47.100]  Nobody does it better than Shopify.
[20:47.420 --> 20:48.820]  They're number one. They're great.
[20:48.920 --> 20:51.100]  They're associated with so many huge brands.
[20:51.260 --> 20:53.480]  They've got an amazing tools to use.
[20:53.640 --> 20:55.180]  It's something that we use.
[20:55.180 --> 20:57.020]  I couldn't recommend them enough.
[20:57.480 --> 21:00.560]  They are the home of the number one checkout on the planet.
[21:01.080 --> 21:05.620]  How would you not not want to have the number one checkout on the planet?
[21:05.920 --> 21:10.440]  I think I double negative there, but that's OK because Shopify is double positive.
[21:10.540 --> 21:11.560]  So I went on the other side of it.
[21:11.860 --> 21:14.400]  Nothing but great things I could say about Shopify.
[21:14.580 --> 21:17.840]  And the not so secret secret is that with shop pay,
[21:17.960 --> 21:21.940]  it boosts conversions up to 50%, which is so important
[21:21.940 --> 21:25.180]  because it's great to have high volume on your store.
[21:25.380 --> 21:27.980]  But if you're not converting that volume into customers,
[21:27.980 --> 21:30.400]  there's not necessarily a lot of value to it.
[21:30.460 --> 21:32.240]  Like, it's just it's great to have the traffic.
[21:32.440 --> 21:37.120]  But to make a profit, you need to have sales, which is huge
[21:37.120 --> 21:39.480]  because it means that with less carts going abandoned,
[21:39.760 --> 21:41.900]  your sales are going to be so much larger.
[21:42.160 --> 21:45.840]  So if you're into growing your business, your commerce platform,
[21:45.960 --> 21:49.880]  be ready to sell wherever your customers are scrolling or strolling
[21:49.880 --> 21:54.340]  on the Web, in your store, in their feed and everywhere in between.
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.880]  You need to be able to reach the consumer where they are.
[21:56.960 --> 21:57.920]  That's such a key part.
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.920]  And Shopify provides that for you.
[22:01.340 --> 22:04.340]  Businesses that sell more sell on Shopify.
[22:04.840 --> 22:08.860]  And what I really love about Shopify is regardless of what your goals are,
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.280]  whether it's to have a giant store or you have a small local business,
[22:13.280 --> 22:19.140]  they have the tools that can support you and enable you to hit that level.
[22:19.140 --> 22:23.920]  So upgrade your business and get the same checkout that we use
[22:23.920 --> 22:28.600]  and sign up for your one dollar per month trial period at Shopify.com
[22:28.600 --> 22:30.960]  slash face all lowercase.
[22:31.140 --> 22:35.700]  Go to Shopify.com slash face the upgrade you're selling today.
[22:35.820 --> 22:40.120]  That is once again, Shopify.com slash face.
[22:41.400 --> 22:43.480]  I have a question, actually, for all of you.
[22:43.560 --> 22:45.700]  Speaking of maybe weird things,
[22:46.260 --> 22:51.360]  um, when you get a form and it says sign your full name,
[22:51.660 --> 22:53.120]  do you include your middle name?
[22:53.740 --> 22:56.340]  Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Always. Yeah.
[22:56.400 --> 22:57.380]  Yes. It's your full name.
[22:59.100 --> 23:03.340]  I just realized that I have not been doing that because for
[23:04.080 --> 23:08.140]  reasons that don't necessarily make sense, like that don't hold weight.
[23:08.380 --> 23:09.580]  You don't know how to follow directions?
[23:10.040 --> 23:12.140]  No. What does full mean to you?
[23:12.480 --> 23:14.880]  Well, OK, so full means every part of it.
[23:14.880 --> 23:16.820]  But here's the thing.
[23:17.140 --> 23:19.980]  Whenever you make a profile on any website,
[23:20.120 --> 23:22.640]  it always says optional in the middle name box.
[23:23.120 --> 23:27.820]  And I have just extrapolated that to every form in my life.
[23:29.140 --> 23:30.200]  What's on your passport?
[23:31.160 --> 23:32.640]  That's a good question.
[23:32.900 --> 23:34.020]  I don't know off the look.
[23:34.480 --> 23:37.460]  I think my full name, but I think I was young enough
[23:37.460 --> 23:40.840]  where somebody else handled that for me on the last passport.
[23:40.960 --> 23:41.980]  I had the last 10 years.
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.160]  How old are you? 10 years ago?
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.960]  I don't think my passport is active at the moment.
[23:46.100 --> 23:47.820]  I don't think I need a new one.
[23:49.200 --> 23:50.480]  Your passport's not active?
[23:50.760 --> 23:53.200]  I think it may have expired like a year ago.
[23:53.320 --> 23:54.740]  We have such different lives.
[23:55.140 --> 23:57.080]  I'd be freaking out if my passport expired.
[23:57.840 --> 23:58.860]  I mean, I haven't checked.
[23:59.420 --> 23:59.980]  I don't know.
[24:00.780 --> 24:03.880]  Andrew's passport was expired during all those trips to Vegas.
[24:03.920 --> 24:04.820]  He was supposed to go to.
[24:05.300 --> 24:06.140]  Oh, my God.
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.200]  I think if my passport expires, I have to leave.
[24:08.880 --> 24:10.140]  Yeah, I noticed you.
[24:10.140 --> 24:12.360]  We have a different situation, I agree.
[24:12.940 --> 24:13.820]  I just did.
[24:13.940 --> 24:16.860]  I filled it out in the most recent form I did.
[24:16.900 --> 24:19.980]  I was signing something and I put my full name as my full name.
[24:20.080 --> 24:22.140]  And then I thought, I often don't do this.
[24:22.180 --> 24:23.600]  Like I maybe sometimes will.
[24:24.040 --> 24:26.900]  And then I realized the reason why I don't is because whenever I make a profile,
[24:27.400 --> 24:31.140]  it always says optional in the middle name box, which then made me feel like
[24:31.640 --> 24:33.020]  people don't like middle names.
[24:33.060 --> 24:33.460]  Who cares?
[24:33.580 --> 24:34.520]  That's like a fake name.
[24:34.760 --> 24:35.640]  Doesn't even count.
[24:36.100 --> 24:38.820]  Do you think do you think anyone's middle name is optional?
[24:38.820 --> 24:42.120]  I view middle names as optional, non-essential.
[24:42.660 --> 24:43.820]  I mean, the name of.
[24:44.060 --> 24:45.420]  I got it. Yeah, somebody.
[24:45.820 --> 24:47.000]  Somebody for sure.
[24:47.220 --> 24:47.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:47.900 --> 24:48.900]  Somebody for sure.
[24:49.160 --> 24:49.600]  Absolutely.
[24:50.260 --> 24:50.880]  They're bullshit.
[24:51.000 --> 24:51.600]  They're fake names.
[24:52.100 --> 24:54.680]  A lot of they're like, hey, I wanted to name.
[24:55.480 --> 24:57.320]  He doesn't understand your joke.
[24:57.560 --> 24:58.220]  I don't think.
[24:58.280 --> 25:00.260]  No, he's saying optional as as a name.
[25:00.480 --> 25:02.220]  The name is a literal name.
[25:02.280 --> 25:02.760]  I got it.
[25:02.940 --> 25:07.100]  My point was that people will name their middle name transformers.
[25:07.100 --> 25:08.280]  Like it doesn't matter.
[25:09.920 --> 25:11.780]  People will have crazy middle names.
[25:13.980 --> 25:15.600]  Andrew Transformers Panton.
[25:16.740 --> 25:18.180]  Can that be on your next possible?
[25:18.860 --> 25:20.880]  Can that be the title of this episode?
[25:21.100 --> 25:22.460]  I'd have to legally change my name.
[25:22.520 --> 25:23.860]  Geoff, how hard is that?
[25:24.420 --> 25:27.740]  Well, I did it a while ago now, about 20 years ago at this point.
[25:27.820 --> 25:29.140]  But it's not too hard.
[25:29.180 --> 25:30.400]  I think it takes a morning.
[25:30.920 --> 25:33.540]  Cost you about 270 bucks, although that's now.
[25:33.720 --> 25:33.880]  Who knows?
[25:34.180 --> 25:36.460]  I won't change my name for five bucks on Xbox.
[25:36.460 --> 25:37.260]  I'm not paying that.
[25:37.980 --> 25:41.320]  What if your middle name was Transformers in brackets 2007?
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.680]  Andrew Transformers 2007.
[25:45.920 --> 25:46.920]  I have no problem with that.
[25:47.880 --> 25:49.200]  It's not a terrible movie.
[25:49.280 --> 25:49.980]  It's not my favorite.
[25:50.540 --> 25:51.520]  It's the best one.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.720]  Why don't you change your name to Gavin Optional Free?
[25:54.380 --> 25:56.400]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[25:56.760 --> 25:58.120]  Do you give a shit about David?
[25:58.700 --> 25:58.980]  No.
[25:59.540 --> 26:00.020]  There you go.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.360]  That's my point.
[26:03.680 --> 26:05.140]  Anyway, I just wanted to see if I was doing.
[26:05.140 --> 26:11.280]  I realized that maybe I shouldn't be applying the same logic to the process
[26:11.280 --> 26:14.980]  of making a fantasy football account that I do all legal documents.
[26:15.460 --> 26:18.660]  So I'm a middle name guy now going forward.
[26:18.900 --> 26:20.840]  We'll always include the middle name.
[26:20.880 --> 26:21.640]  Good to know.
[26:23.060 --> 26:24.640]  Andrew Transformers Panton.
[26:24.940 --> 26:29.200]  Are you going to include the full middle name or just the middle initial?
[26:30.580 --> 26:31.740]  Oh, can I do that?
[26:32.440 --> 26:35.180]  Does that allow giving him options?
[26:35.320 --> 26:37.660]  Some forms only ask for middle initial.
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.500]  Some forms only ask for middle initial, though.
[26:39.560 --> 26:40.380]  Oh, man.
[26:40.620 --> 26:41.660]  Not official forms.
[26:41.880 --> 26:42.200]  Yeah.
[26:42.840 --> 26:43.580]  What? Where?
[26:43.820 --> 26:44.220]  Why not?
[26:44.780 --> 26:45.560]  OK, why not?
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.120]  OK, well, now I that that I think I get a middle initial all the time on forms.
[26:50.340 --> 26:53.980]  I will say I haven't run into trouble with this yet, so.
[26:54.880 --> 26:56.220]  I can feel good about that.
[26:56.960 --> 26:57.880]  This is going to be a problem.
[26:57.960 --> 27:01.480]  I feel like it would have occurred by now, but it hasn't.
[27:01.740 --> 27:02.760]  When do you get a new possible?
[27:03.400 --> 27:05.400]  Uh, I should do that.
[27:05.880 --> 27:07.580]  You're not going to be able to eat any beans if you don't.
[27:08.080 --> 27:08.640]  That's true.
[27:09.660 --> 27:11.120]  But yeah, I don't know.
[27:11.220 --> 27:11.700]  Beans.
[27:15.380 --> 27:16.840]  I don't know.
[27:17.600 --> 27:19.240]  God damn, man.
[27:19.580 --> 27:21.320]  I have a I have a CPAP story.
[27:22.300 --> 27:23.420]  Oh, yes.
[27:23.820 --> 27:28.000]  The other day I learned what happens when you have a power cut.
[27:28.660 --> 27:29.760]  Oh, no.
[27:30.300 --> 27:32.140]  I never even considered that.
[27:32.240 --> 27:34.460]  Yeah. Oh, shit.
[27:34.820 --> 27:38.160]  I might be investing in a UPS here pretty soon for the old bedroom.
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.900]  Because the the the the CPAP goes in my nose holes
[27:45.440 --> 27:51.100]  and the air travels like either side of my head up to the hose on the top of my head.
[27:51.600 --> 27:52.700]  It looks really good.
[27:52.760 --> 27:54.120]  I look really good while I'm wearing it.
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.240]  But when the thing turns off, there's no airflow.
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.920]  And I just started inhaling the remaining air of the
[28:04.920 --> 28:07.080]  of the hose and all the stuff around my head.
[28:07.280 --> 28:09.060]  And it and it squeezed my head.
[28:10.040 --> 28:11.360]  You got a head squeeze?
[28:11.940 --> 28:14.480]  I started constricting my own head with my lungs.
[28:15.140 --> 28:16.220]  Oh, man.
[28:17.600 --> 28:20.040]  And then I was in the middle of a dream.
[28:20.140 --> 28:21.520]  The dream didn't end particularly well.
[28:21.560 --> 28:22.640]  And then I woke up like...
[28:24.120 --> 28:26.220]  Did you dream you were being strangled by an anaconda?
[28:26.800 --> 28:28.220]  I definitely was dreaming that I couldn't breathe.
[28:28.440 --> 28:30.120]  It was it was all over pretty quickly.
[28:30.300 --> 28:31.940]  But yeah, very unpleasant experience.
[28:32.000 --> 28:32.720]  I don't recommend it.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.820]  Oh, my God. That's crazy.
[28:35.680 --> 28:38.320]  I didn't even consider that.
[28:38.480 --> 28:41.760]  That like obviously that could happen, but the effects of that.
[28:42.340 --> 28:44.940]  Yeah. Is there a is it how you have the hose?
[28:44.960 --> 28:48.300]  Like if you position it differently, would it have had less of an impact?
[28:48.660 --> 28:51.440]  I don't think so, because you're immediately sucking all the air out of
[28:51.940 --> 28:53.080]  just creating a vacuum, I guess.
[28:53.080 --> 28:54.640]  Yeah, just the head squeeze part.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.980]  But I guess it's the rig probably as well.
[28:57.120 --> 28:59.480]  It's just because the bit the bits on the side are very soft.
[28:59.840 --> 29:04.100]  OK. And the hose is more firm, but the bits around my face are like
[29:04.100 --> 29:05.120]  you lie on it and stuff.
[29:05.560 --> 29:08.340]  And I assume this there's one on each side, because if I lie on one side,
[29:08.380 --> 29:11.600]  I crush the pipe and the other side can still be used.
[29:12.080 --> 29:13.120]  Hmm. Hmm.
[29:14.280 --> 29:17.720]  Aside from the power outage, has the has the CPAP going?
[29:17.820 --> 29:18.740]  Have you dialed it in better?
[29:19.280 --> 29:21.280]  Oh, yeah. So much better than than before.
[29:21.400 --> 29:22.280]  Getting all the way through the night.
[29:22.280 --> 29:23.940]  I'm not I'm not waking up full of air.
[29:24.280 --> 29:26.420]  It happens maybe once a month now.
[29:27.240 --> 29:31.020]  Wow. Really? So no more like just like intense fart pains?
[29:31.540 --> 29:34.160]  No. No, it's been it's been great.
[29:34.300 --> 29:37.440]  I'd love to know what the once a month cause has been for you.
[29:37.920 --> 29:39.000]  Like what happens? What?
[29:39.100 --> 29:41.360]  Why do you experience that?
[29:41.940 --> 29:42.900]  Is it something you eat?
[29:43.360 --> 29:44.620]  Is it a way you sleep?
[29:45.060 --> 29:46.060]  It must be the way I sleep.
[29:46.440 --> 29:47.280]  A certain angle.
[29:48.080 --> 29:49.440]  You got a gassy angle?
[29:51.840 --> 29:54.200]  Plane in bed and you're like, I can't fall asleep in this position.
[29:54.300 --> 29:55.180]  I'm going to be all gassy.
[29:55.780 --> 29:57.240]  I mean, that must be the case.
[29:57.900 --> 30:00.120]  There surely are some angles that are gassy than others.
[30:00.460 --> 30:01.180]  Oh, for sure.
[30:01.840 --> 30:02.420]  Do you want to see it?
[30:02.440 --> 30:04.000]  Do you want to see a pic of me on the CPAP?
[30:04.400 --> 30:06.400]  Yes. I have it. I have one of you.
[30:06.900 --> 30:07.980]  Yeah. Look how good this looks.
[30:08.620 --> 30:09.860]  Oh, that's a different one.
[30:10.020 --> 30:10.960]  Oh, my God.
[30:11.580 --> 30:14.740]  You look like you're going in for a very serious surgery.
[30:17.500 --> 30:20.980]  You kind of, I think there's a way you can make it look like
[30:20.980 --> 30:23.260]  you're going to do an underwater mission in GTA.
[30:23.600 --> 30:26.100]  Kind of looks like the rebreather, but for your nose.
[30:27.360 --> 30:29.900]  Yeah, I've got the the wetsuit that I grew.
[30:30.520 --> 30:33.440]  Yeah, you're working on it.
[30:35.200 --> 30:35.840]  That's great.
[30:36.060 --> 30:37.280]  Oh, man.
[30:37.440 --> 30:40.780]  So just a full face squeeze that makes it so much funnier seeing it.
[30:42.740 --> 30:44.720]  That feels like a bad place to have the hose in.
[30:44.720 --> 30:45.700]  Is it the top of the back?
[30:46.300 --> 30:48.660]  I think I feel like I would prefer being in the front.
[30:48.900 --> 30:49.860]  You could have them in the front.
[30:50.200 --> 30:51.540]  I just sometimes sleep on my front.
[30:52.040 --> 30:53.560]  Do you move around a lot when you sleep?
[30:53.660 --> 30:55.560]  You sleep on your front? Wow.
[30:56.000 --> 30:57.400]  Sometimes. Like face down?
[30:57.820 --> 30:59.760]  Yeah. And I don't need a...
[31:00.260 --> 31:02.940]  I don't need like any air now because it comes straight into my nose.
[31:06.060 --> 31:09.220]  I could tape like three pillows to the front of my face and still breathe.
[31:10.760 --> 31:12.280]  Oh, I'm going to write that down.
[31:13.240 --> 31:15.940]  Pillow Mountain has a new expansion.
[31:17.040 --> 31:17.860]  New wing.
[31:18.440 --> 31:21.640]  Dude, if somebody tried to strangle you with pillows, you would totally live.
[31:22.720 --> 31:27.060]  Just imagining someone on top of me pushing a pillow into my face.
[31:27.160 --> 31:28.960]  And I'm just like shrugging with my hands.
[31:29.420 --> 31:31.420]  It only makes me stronger.
[31:32.640 --> 31:34.280]  She's just pushing the air in.
[31:35.080 --> 31:36.320]  You're getting a better sleep.
[31:36.980 --> 31:38.340]  Have any of you done sleep studies?
[31:38.740 --> 31:40.040]  Any of the rest of you? No.
[31:40.040 --> 31:42.100]  I think you should all do it.
[31:42.500 --> 31:44.540]  Nah. I think you should all get the apnea test.
[31:44.940 --> 31:46.060]  Nah. I've done.
[31:46.140 --> 31:49.040]  I've done sleep studies, but it was in college just to make money.
[31:49.100 --> 31:52.480]  It wasn't like personal sleep studies to make me better.
[31:52.980 --> 31:53.740]  What were they looking at?
[31:56.340 --> 31:58.340]  Whatever they needed, I said I had.
[31:58.460 --> 32:01.660]  And then they would just hook me up to a bunch of monitors.
[32:02.060 --> 32:03.860]  So it was really anything.
[32:04.180 --> 32:06.620]  It was anything. That was it.
[32:10.040 --> 32:11.520]  So you would just say, yeah, I have this.
[32:11.560 --> 32:14.340]  And then they would they'd be like, OK, let's monitor you to see the result.
[32:14.340 --> 32:15.700]  It's not something I'm exactly proud of.
[32:15.900 --> 32:17.340]  But oh, I guess. Yeah.
[32:17.440 --> 32:21.500]  I mean, it was really in college when it was like, I don't have any money.
[32:21.640 --> 32:23.280]  I get it. We'll do this for money.
[32:23.540 --> 32:25.740]  Hey, we need someone who wakes up a lot in the middle of the night.
[32:25.820 --> 32:26.340]  Yeah, that's me.
[32:26.700 --> 32:30.220]  Hey, we need someone who stays asleep and like sleeps through alarms.
[32:30.300 --> 32:30.880]  Yeah, that's me.
[32:31.140 --> 32:35.440]  Like, it is whatever it takes to get the two free meals
[32:35.440 --> 32:39.040]  and like the eighty one dollars at the end of the night.
[32:39.040 --> 32:41.440]  And you didn't care about just skewing all that data.
[32:41.580 --> 32:44.080]  I did. Listen, listen, I don't.
[32:44.240 --> 32:45.840]  I don't. Again, not something I'm proud of.
[32:45.860 --> 32:47.440]  It just something it was something that happened.
[32:47.800 --> 32:51.020]  It would be so interesting to know what percent of the data is that.
[32:51.120 --> 32:52.120]  What if it's all that?
[32:52.200 --> 32:53.680]  What if every person on the test?
[32:54.020 --> 32:56.700]  Honestly, it's probably a lot more than most people think.
[32:56.740 --> 32:58.320]  It is not hard to get into a lot of those.
[32:58.440 --> 33:01.480]  They need to have a third box of I'm just here for the two free weeks.
[33:01.480 --> 33:02.400]  And I'm here for the paycheck.
[33:04.680 --> 33:07.000]  Those places will contact you for a long time afterward, too.
[33:07.000 --> 33:10.620]  Yeah, they were big in Austin in the 90s, in the early 2000s.
[33:10.680 --> 33:11.960]  They did a lot of like a
[33:13.520 --> 33:16.620]  getting your molar pulled studies to kids
[33:16.620 --> 33:18.700]  could go get it for free or get paid like a couple hundred bucks.
[33:18.760 --> 33:20.500]  Have your motor molars pulled and then
[33:21.400 --> 33:22.480]  are not molar. What is it?
[33:22.640 --> 33:23.600]  What's the other one?
[33:23.680 --> 33:26.580]  Wisdom. Wisdom teeth. Yes. OK, I just I'm sorry.
[33:26.660 --> 33:28.560]  I just had like I just had like nine.
[33:28.640 --> 33:31.020]  I just had like an hour of cat scans on my molars today.
[33:31.060 --> 33:32.060]  So I have molars on the brain.
[33:33.040 --> 33:34.280]  Yeah, your wisdom teeth.
[33:34.300 --> 33:36.100]  And then they would give you like medicines.
[33:36.100 --> 33:39.040]  And sometimes they'd be a placebo to determine, like, you know,
[33:39.420 --> 33:40.780]  how well the pain meds worked.
[33:41.300 --> 33:45.680]  If they just took the molars, could you just use the wisdoms more easily?
[33:46.280 --> 33:48.500]  No. Oh, well, well,
[33:49.760 --> 33:50.440]  you know what?
[33:50.440 --> 33:52.300]  Nick probably knows because his dad is a dentist.
[33:52.460 --> 33:53.800]  So I'm not going to argue this point.
[33:54.180 --> 33:54.400]  Fair play.
[33:54.820 --> 33:57.880]  Because I feel like the thing with wisdom teeth is they can go the wrong way.
[33:58.300 --> 33:58.960]  Yeah. Yeah.
[33:59.540 --> 34:03.000]  Eric, did you ever did you did you did the sleep test one?
[34:03.080 --> 34:04.380]  Did you ever do jizzes and stuff?
[34:04.380 --> 34:06.400]  No, not that one.
[34:06.580 --> 34:10.500]  So the way it would go was the sleep ones,
[34:10.620 --> 34:12.380]  the sleep ones paid the most.
[34:13.020 --> 34:16.880]  The ones that would take your blood would be like
[34:16.880 --> 34:19.620]  not as much as the sleep ones, but they were good.
[34:19.760 --> 34:23.980]  And then a lot of them were just like placebo effect.
[34:24.040 --> 34:26.220]  Like I would assume placebo effect, whatever.
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.520]  It's it's just, you know, it's I never did ones where I had to come into a cup.
[34:30.660 --> 34:31.900]  I did have to piss into a cup.
[34:32.540 --> 34:36.940]  From my understanding, you need to like a really high level of cum to get paid for it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.740]  I would be shocked if any of us.
[34:38.960 --> 34:40.100]  So how much now?
[34:40.340 --> 34:43.000]  Now, yeah. Now let's figure out what exactly you mean by that.
[34:43.280 --> 34:45.600]  You need like a good volume, like you need to fill the cup.
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.320]  I think it's a mix of like what your hereditary data is
[34:49.320 --> 34:54.080]  as far as like different types of things, as well as like sperm count and efficiency,
[34:54.240 --> 34:54.740]  like the effectiveness.
[34:54.740 --> 34:57.700]  So you're not talking about like a line on a cup saying jizz up to here?
[34:58.620 --> 35:00.540]  No, no, no.
[35:00.540 --> 35:02.040]  I'm not talking literal volume.
[35:02.200 --> 35:06.280]  I'm talking like I think there's a bunch of I think they like test you first
[35:06.280 --> 35:09.620]  to determine if your cum is worth paying for, essentially.
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.600]  I could be wrong about all of this, but that's my understanding.
[35:14.880 --> 35:17.860]  Wait, they test that they test your blood or they test your cum?
[35:18.160 --> 35:19.020]  I don't know.
[35:19.580 --> 35:22.740]  Because it'd be weird to test blood and they'd be like, OK, give us the cum
[35:22.740 --> 35:24.260]  when they could have just tested the cum.
[35:24.660 --> 35:27.980]  Yeah, but it also feels weird to like you give them cum
[35:27.980 --> 35:29.120]  and they don't need it ultimately.
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.700]  It's strange either way, I feel like.
[35:32.840 --> 35:36.700]  But I could once again, I've never tried this, but I feel like that's what I've heard.
[35:37.160 --> 35:42.180]  That has been my rough understanding is that it's actually not easy to sell cum.
[35:42.540 --> 35:44.920]  Well, you must have looked into it, though, if you know this much about it.
[35:45.200 --> 35:46.660]  Could you potentially ask your mom?
[35:46.800 --> 35:48.160]  She knows a lot about medical stuff.
[35:48.400 --> 35:49.560]  Not in this field.
[35:49.940 --> 35:51.520]  She's only she was on the other side.
[35:51.520 --> 35:54.760]  Once the baby was born, that's when she came into play.
[35:54.860 --> 35:55.680]  She was not pre-baby.
[35:56.220 --> 35:56.240]  Gotcha.
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.940]  I just I feel like I've heard people talk about this and that's my
[36:01.480 --> 36:03.460]  I've never personally looked into it.
[36:04.320 --> 36:07.460]  I know there's a scene in The Way of the Gun where they explain the pricing of all.
[36:07.540 --> 36:09.520]  Dude, that was a good movie, The Way of the Gun.
[36:10.020 --> 36:11.620]  It's a great action scene at the end.
[36:11.660 --> 36:12.800]  Like top five cum movies?
[36:15.060 --> 36:15.860]  Uh, probably.
[36:17.540 --> 36:20.400]  There's a scene in that movie that I think about all the time
[36:20.400 --> 36:22.420]  for a shootout, uh.
[36:23.460 --> 36:27.300]  We're like a character dives over a thing to like take cover,
[36:27.340 --> 36:30.600]  and there's just a whole bunch of broken beer bottles in the thing
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.300]  and you just get shredded by it.
[36:32.980 --> 36:35.200]  Not fun, very graphic.
[36:36.340 --> 36:37.780]  That's a pretty graphic movie, if I remember.
[36:37.840 --> 36:39.640]  I haven't seen it since it came out, but I remember it being pretty.
[36:40.060 --> 36:41.480]  It's very campy.
[36:41.660 --> 36:43.300]  Yeah. Yeah, that
[36:45.560 --> 36:48.620]  dives over and his arm just gets filled with glass
[36:48.620 --> 36:50.680]  and he has to like slowly pull it out.
[36:50.700 --> 36:52.440]  And it's not fun.
[36:53.080 --> 36:53.400]  Yuck.
[36:54.100 --> 36:56.180]  Oh, yeah, there's a guy that gets shot in the dick in that movie.
[36:56.280 --> 36:56.540]  It's good.
[36:56.600 --> 36:58.340]  Maybe The Way of the Gun is a better movie than I remember.
[37:01.020 --> 37:02.820]  Um, I was speaking asleep.
[37:03.220 --> 37:06.280]  I found my I found my eye mask again
[37:06.780 --> 37:10.000]  that I hadn't I misplaced it and I lost it for about a year.
[37:11.180 --> 37:11.800]  Rediscovered it.
[37:12.500 --> 37:14.280]  And I don't think I can use it.
[37:14.500 --> 37:17.540]  I think I got to like slowly transition into using it.
[37:17.540 --> 37:20.320]  I've somehow I've developed like bird brain.
[37:20.420 --> 37:22.600]  I've learned since getting it back.
[37:22.860 --> 37:27.680]  I will put it on and instantly fall asleep because it's so dark.
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.740]  And I think it's partially because the blinds where I live don't really work.
[37:32.740 --> 37:34.380]  So it's always like in the day.
[37:34.500 --> 37:36.540]  It's always somewhat bright, even at night.
[37:36.540 --> 37:37.360]  It's kind of bright.
[37:38.880 --> 37:43.520]  So I put it on and then it's pitch black to an extent I'm not used to.
[37:43.800 --> 37:47.160]  And I instantly fall asleep and then I'll wake up at some point
[37:47.160 --> 37:50.720]  and feel kind of panic because of how dark it is and I'm having to adjust.
[37:51.420 --> 37:54.720]  But I feel like a bird where like they cover the cage
[37:54.720 --> 37:56.960]  and it tricks it immediately thinking it's night.
[37:57.080 --> 38:00.220]  Like that's that is where my brain is at with this thing.
[38:00.260 --> 38:02.580]  I put the mask on. I'm like, Oh, this is nice. It's dark.
[38:02.680 --> 38:03.400]  Then I fall asleep.
[38:03.480 --> 38:06.740]  Then I wake up going, Why? Where am I? Type thing.
[38:07.380 --> 38:09.300]  Have I have I told you my weird thing with eye masks?
[38:09.700 --> 38:11.740]  I brought it up and you related to it.
[38:11.760 --> 38:13.940]  I don't know if it's the same point I saw on the show.
[38:13.940 --> 38:15.900]  I have an issue with them
[38:15.900 --> 38:18.000]  because I can't tell if my eyes are closed or not.
[38:19.400 --> 38:20.960]  Yeah. And you said, yeah.
[38:21.100 --> 38:24.220]  And that made me feel seen in a way that we both, I think,
[38:24.280 --> 38:26.940]  felt a moment of like, wow, this guy gets me.
[38:27.540 --> 38:31.480]  I have a thing that really annoys Meg where I have to put my eye
[38:31.480 --> 38:33.160]  mask on when the lights are off.
[38:33.760 --> 38:37.920]  Otherwise, it just feels like the lights are still on. Really?
[38:38.320 --> 38:41.000]  Yeah. So if Meg is like still up and about doing something,
[38:41.620 --> 38:43.440]  I'll make her turn off the lights.
[38:43.440 --> 38:48.540]  So I can put the eye mask on and my brain kind of saves the dark room as an image.
[38:48.720 --> 38:50.380]  And then she can turn the lights back on again.
[38:50.520 --> 38:52.820]  And even though I can't see the light, it feels like they're off.
[38:54.120 --> 38:54.800]  That's great.
[38:55.040 --> 38:58.460]  So, Andrew, if you if you were in a pitch black room,
[38:58.460 --> 39:00.360]  how would you know if your eyes were open or closed?
[39:01.100 --> 39:03.140]  I think I could feel them. I would be able to feel it.
[39:03.180 --> 39:04.840]  It's the thing that the eye mask is your face.
[39:04.840 --> 39:07.000]  It's a pressure crunch. Yeah. OK.
[39:07.120 --> 39:09.800]  It is a weighted eye mask specifically.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.520]  So like there's a weight to it.
[39:11.520 --> 39:14.580]  Um, yeah, so I think that that would be the difference.
[39:14.920 --> 39:17.620]  Is that good? Like you want that? You want the weight?
[39:18.140 --> 39:20.200]  Sometimes you just want to feel like you're getting squished.
[39:21.040 --> 39:22.980]  That's what Gavin's doing with his CPAP machine.
[39:23.100 --> 39:24.900]  He's just kind of sucking his brain in or whatever.
[39:25.180 --> 39:27.100]  Yeah, but he's he is stale air.
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.140]  If Gavin was getting fresh air while squeezing his face,
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.940]  I think that would be a fine experience.
[39:32.380 --> 39:36.440]  Yeah. Well, yeah, it was more like the breathing, but not getting any air.
[39:36.500 --> 39:38.940]  And your lungs kind of do that, like that.
[39:39.540 --> 39:42.720]  Sometimes no mountain falls or it has in the past.
[39:42.880 --> 39:46.060]  And it's not the worst feeling in the world.
[39:46.060 --> 39:48.060]  Just being toppled by pillows.
[39:50.720 --> 39:52.700]  It's like the softest avalanche ever.
[39:53.120 --> 39:54.460]  I have a new problem of
[39:55.600 --> 39:59.560]  I got a king size duvet.
[40:01.080 --> 40:02.060]  That's the name, right?
[40:02.100 --> 40:03.240]  It's a fancy word for sheep.
[40:03.860 --> 40:06.600]  I mean, it's like a fluffy insert.
[40:06.600 --> 40:09.720]  Yeah. So I got that and I have a cover.
[40:10.180 --> 40:12.060]  And my partner and I use different.
[40:12.320 --> 40:16.100]  We have separate sheets that like they cross, but like we each have a sheet
[40:16.100 --> 40:19.880]  because we're both like hogs essentially in the night for a sheet.
[40:20.900 --> 40:21.620]  Night hogs.
[40:21.700 --> 40:22.320]  Night, night, night.
[40:22.400 --> 40:25.900]  Like the mattress sheet or like the top sheet or the top, the duvet.
[40:26.040 --> 40:28.060]  We both have we have two duvets on the bed.
[40:28.440 --> 40:30.300]  They have their duvet. I have my duvet.
[40:30.940 --> 40:34.180]  Why don't you start by saying I got a duvet, but then we both share different sheets.
[40:34.320 --> 40:35.220]  Like you mean the same thing?
[40:35.220 --> 40:37.380]  I don't know what I'm saying, to be honest.
[40:37.540 --> 40:38.700]  But we both have two duvets.
[40:39.120 --> 40:40.320]  We have two duvets.
[40:40.740 --> 40:44.860]  And my the one I just got myself is a king one that I got on sale.
[40:45.200 --> 40:48.600]  And then it has a it has a cover on it.
[40:49.020 --> 40:50.980]  But I split half the bed.
[40:51.500 --> 40:52.560]  So I have way too much.
[40:52.720 --> 40:55.760]  The bed, the sheet ratio is a lot.
[40:55.860 --> 40:58.460]  I'm really struggling with balancing the sheet.
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.260]  It just it's turned into a weighted blanket because it's too much sheet
[41:02.900 --> 41:04.200]  for just my side.
[41:04.200 --> 41:06.480]  It ends up stacking on itself.
[41:06.620 --> 41:08.580]  Why did you buy a king size for half a bed?
[41:08.960 --> 41:12.980]  Well, because it is a king size bed, but I'm only using half of it
[41:12.980 --> 41:14.140]  because it's my sheet.
[41:15.340 --> 41:18.100]  Yeah. You didn't you didn't foresee that?
[41:18.220 --> 41:20.440]  I'm like, man, this will be a shitload of sheet.
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.540]  Well, here's my previous one was a queen and that was totally fine.
[41:25.560 --> 41:28.300]  And I have upgraded to a king because it was on sale.
[41:28.460 --> 41:31.320]  And it has been a problem of too many sheet.
[41:31.320 --> 41:33.080]  Just it's it's everywhere.
[41:33.460 --> 41:37.020]  And I have to end up stacking it on them if I'm getting out of bed
[41:37.020 --> 41:40.100]  and they're in bed because there's no space because I'm a side.
[41:40.160 --> 41:41.640]  I'm a like edge sleeper.
[41:41.740 --> 41:43.020]  I like being on that corner.
[41:44.700 --> 41:46.880]  And it has been an adjustment.
[41:47.140 --> 41:49.120]  It's the whole sleep thing has been a whole thing.
[41:49.560 --> 41:50.540]  What is edge sleep for me?
[41:51.080 --> 41:52.220]  I sleep on the edge.
[41:52.680 --> 41:54.460]  On the right on the edge of the bed. Yeah.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.620]  Yeah, I do not go into the center.
[42:02.660 --> 42:05.400]  So you got all these pillows.
[42:05.660 --> 42:09.600]  They're slowly falling down the back of the bed, which is like pushing the bed out.
[42:09.640 --> 42:15.520]  But you're just on the edge with a king sized duvet.
[42:16.900 --> 42:20.720]  You're like you're like sleeping on the fringes like you don't.
[42:21.200 --> 42:23.380]  You like don't use the middle of the mattress.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.860]  You just use like the very top and the very side.
[42:26.400 --> 42:27.460]  So it was nice
[42:28.980 --> 42:31.920]  before when I was in the bed just by myself.
[42:32.540 --> 42:34.360]  The pillows would fall where they may.
[42:34.540 --> 42:35.920]  I could grab a pillow. I could adjust.
[42:36.340 --> 42:38.000]  I would be more in the central there.
[42:38.260 --> 42:41.680]  But I have a constant fear of like I am taking up too much space
[42:41.680 --> 42:43.160]  or I'm being an annoyance.
[42:43.360 --> 42:46.840]  So I am an edge sleeper to give as much room as possible.
[42:46.840 --> 42:47.820]  And I don't mind it.
[42:48.180 --> 42:49.980]  Andrew, I agree with you. I do the exact same thing.
[42:50.080 --> 42:50.960]  I don't think it's weird at all.
[42:51.240 --> 42:52.480]  I'm an edge sleeper as well.
[42:52.760 --> 42:55.500]  And I think it becomes weird where there's so many pillow.
[42:55.500 --> 42:59.780]  It's become a problem where the pillow to actual bed space is an issue
[42:59.780 --> 43:01.400]  because they don't want seven pillows.
[43:01.680 --> 43:05.900]  So I either I have to like reassign the pillows.
[43:06.120 --> 43:09.680]  I have a space between my bedside table
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.400]  and the bed that I just shove pillows into as a whole spot now.
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.760]  So there's pillows down the back and down the side.
[43:17.900 --> 43:21.300]  Well, there's always pillows down the side and they are to fill
[43:21.300 --> 43:23.640]  as more pillows go down the back.
[43:23.680 --> 43:25.580]  I pull from the side pillows.
[43:25.860 --> 43:27.000]  All right. What about this?
[43:27.320 --> 43:27.960]  What about this, right?
[43:28.860 --> 43:32.640]  Get one pillow that's the perfect height and then that's it.
[43:33.100 --> 43:33.880]  Oh, we went over this.
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.440]  I just I need a I guess I could talk about that.
[43:37.980 --> 43:41.840]  I I have that bed frame that has a backstop or whatever.
[43:43.140 --> 43:44.400]  Headboard. Headboard. Yeah.
[43:45.020 --> 43:46.060]  That's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[43:46.060 --> 43:47.680]  Backstop. Yeah. The bed backstop. Yeah.
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.300]  Yeah. So so your pillows are down the side.
[43:51.360 --> 43:52.960]  Are they touching the floor? Yeah.
[43:54.520 --> 43:55.760]  Oh, no, it's clean.
[43:56.040 --> 43:56.740]  It's clean floor.
[43:57.100 --> 43:57.820]  It's just pointless.
[43:58.460 --> 44:00.020]  There's no reason for it.
[44:00.320 --> 44:02.220]  No, there's not enough space in the bed.
[44:02.800 --> 44:05.280]  If I kept them in the bed, I'd have to create a pillow line
[44:05.280 --> 44:06.700]  between me and my partner.
[44:06.900 --> 44:09.240]  And that just feels weird like that.
[44:09.440 --> 44:12.020]  That feels like we're going through something when we're not.
[44:12.540 --> 44:16.460]  So you're storing the pillows under the bed to keep them out of the way.
[44:16.460 --> 44:19.080]  Yes, but I'm going to use them.
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.060]  They come into play.
[44:20.520 --> 44:22.320]  Yeah, it used to be to pull from like the quick.
[44:22.440 --> 44:24.120]  It's like a quick bag of pillows.
[44:24.620 --> 44:27.240]  Yeah. So that's that's the solution for that.
[44:27.280 --> 44:31.900]  But the the backboard bed situation, I called a moving company about it
[44:31.900 --> 44:32.580]  and they were not.
[44:33.200 --> 44:36.020]  They were very confused by my situation and what I required.
[44:37.280 --> 44:38.520]  No, no way.
[44:40.280 --> 44:42.660]  And I've now encountered a problem where I just don't know.
[44:42.820 --> 44:43.740]  So I can hire.
[44:44.040 --> 44:45.920]  There are people that get rid of stuff
[44:45.920 --> 44:49.940]  and there are people that move stuff, but there aren't in my area
[44:49.940 --> 44:54.360]  for what I could tell people that both get rid of stuff and move stuff for you.
[44:55.880 --> 44:57.540]  So I'm at a I'm at a cross.
[44:57.640 --> 45:01.860]  Oh, I got to know what to do because I can hire someone to get rid of.
[45:02.640 --> 45:05.000]  So this is the I don't know if I've described this fully,
[45:05.100 --> 45:08.560]  but I have a bed on the top level that I need to get rid of.
[45:09.100 --> 45:10.380]  No, that's wrong.
[45:10.620 --> 45:13.020]  I need to get rid of the bed on the middle level.
[45:13.560 --> 45:17.140]  I have a bed on the middle level that I need to get rid of,
[45:17.180 --> 45:20.400]  and then I want to move the bed on the upper level to the middle level
[45:20.400 --> 45:22.420]  as like a guest room type thing.
[45:24.480 --> 45:24.880]  But.
[45:26.620 --> 45:30.540]  They're they're heavy, and like, I also have the the bed frame thing
[45:30.540 --> 45:32.980]  I'd like to have brought up, and that's heavy
[45:34.060 --> 45:37.800]  to the top of the middle to the top, so that's going to the top.
[45:38.220 --> 45:43.340]  Uh, so I need someone to get rid of the middle thing
[45:43.340 --> 45:46.840]  and then move the top to the middle once the middle is clear.
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.700]  And I just haven't been able to find anyone that is willing to do that
[45:50.700 --> 45:54.340]  at a rate that is reasonable or that makes sense.
[45:54.840 --> 45:56.380]  Does TaskRabbit exist?
[45:56.800 --> 46:00.200]  Dude, I'm on the website right now looking at what it would be.
[46:00.400 --> 46:01.700]  I heard about that.
[46:01.780 --> 46:04.320]  I don't think it is available where I live.
[46:04.720 --> 46:06.080]  OK, I think I live in too small.
[46:06.080 --> 46:09.200]  OK, so I'll Google TaskRabbit Canada equivalent
[46:10.280 --> 46:14.140]  because it's so I called a movie company and I was like, I need this.
[46:14.240 --> 46:15.320]  I need to move this bed.
[46:15.360 --> 46:18.380]  I need to get rid of the bed and I need to have this pulled up.
[46:18.420 --> 46:19.900]  And they're like, well, wait, you need this.
[46:19.940 --> 46:21.220]  And we went back and forth for a while.
[46:21.600 --> 46:23.800]  And then they told me it would be a $500 minimum
[46:24.180 --> 46:25.980]  because you have to book them for three hours.
[46:26.640 --> 46:28.980]  Well, yeah, I assume they book out the van as well.
[46:29.100 --> 46:30.620]  And yeah, totally. Like, it makes sense.
[46:30.660 --> 46:32.080]  But I just did. It's not.
[46:32.080 --> 46:36.200]  But then I have somebody else that I've used for like chair removal.
[46:36.260 --> 46:39.600]  I got rid of all the chairs outside of the Herman Miller and
[46:40.500 --> 46:41.960]  but they don't move furniture.
[46:43.200 --> 46:44.900]  Huh? TaskRabbit Vancouver, Canada.
[46:47.880 --> 46:51.360]  Well, I did see that as a dot com and went,
[46:51.460 --> 46:53.140]  that probably is just an American thing.
[46:54.840 --> 46:56.340]  Choose a task by price.
[46:57.020 --> 47:00.020]  I bet you could get a TaskRabbit guy or you could probably just call
[47:00.020 --> 47:01.460]  a regular handyman.
[47:03.240 --> 47:04.740]  Handyman's move things?
[47:05.340 --> 47:05.880]  I bet you could.
[47:06.040 --> 47:10.940]  I bet you could lay out your situation and then he could either say yes or no.
[47:13.920 --> 47:15.260]  Oh, it's removal.
[47:15.920 --> 47:17.360]  Don't do it right now.
[47:18.440 --> 47:19.840]  I'm just looking at what you said.
[47:19.900 --> 47:23.560]  I wonder if there are any any Vancouver Island based listeners.
[47:24.440 --> 47:26.320]  I don't want to have a listener come in.
[47:26.720 --> 47:28.240]  I was about to say the same thing.
[47:28.240 --> 47:30.600]  That's the craziest fucking thing you've ever said, Gavin.
[47:32.780 --> 47:34.340]  Hey, anyone like this podcast?
[47:34.400 --> 47:36.100]  Want to come over to my house?
[47:36.380 --> 47:38.180]  Are you out of your fucking mind?
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.100]  It's a little it's a little much like I did.
[47:43.200 --> 47:47.200]  Maybe a coffee shop or like we could start somewhere in the
[47:47.760 --> 47:49.840]  in like a meeting phase.
[47:49.840 --> 47:51.520]  I feel like straight to the home.
[47:55.180 --> 47:57.240]  Like, I feel like even people you meet
[47:57.800 --> 48:00.760]  at work and then become friends with, I feel like it's rare.
[48:00.920 --> 48:02.140]  It's immediately a home visit.
[48:02.360 --> 48:04.980]  I feel like there's sort of a build to it.
[48:06.180 --> 48:07.380]  I've had listeners in my home.
[48:08.120 --> 48:08.920]  So have I. You.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.560]  Hey, I've never been to Gavin's house.
[48:12.580 --> 48:13.880]  Be very careful, Andrew.
[48:13.960 --> 48:15.400]  They turn into Gavin sometimes.
[48:17.380 --> 48:20.400]  I had a guy deliver a Christmas tree once and he was like, oh, shit.
[48:20.760 --> 48:21.920]  Can I take a picture?
[48:22.560 --> 48:26.360]  I was like, yeah, can we just do it against like a blank wall or something?
[48:27.680 --> 48:28.080]  Yeah.
[48:30.540 --> 48:32.780]  You should have a blank wall just for that scenario.
[48:33.720 --> 48:35.260]  A little tripod in front of it.
[48:35.380 --> 48:37.820]  There's nothing better than somebody delivering a pizza and going like,
[48:37.880 --> 48:39.700]  oh, hey, Geoff, so this is where you live, huh?
[48:40.680 --> 48:42.140]  I've got to remember that.
[48:42.360 --> 48:42.760]  Apparently.
[48:43.840 --> 48:46.540]  Do you guys use fake names for delivery apps?
[48:47.100 --> 48:48.080]  No, no.
[48:48.520 --> 48:50.620]  I use a fake name on almost everything ever.
[48:51.080 --> 48:52.840]  Really? Yeah, I got like 20 names.
[48:53.320 --> 48:53.900]  What middle name?
[48:57.380 --> 48:59.640]  I don't have any fake middle names.
[48:59.680 --> 49:01.260]  See, just start writing.
[49:01.520 --> 49:03.580]  Just start writing optional. Optional.
[49:05.900 --> 49:07.840]  It's got to be confusing to be you.
[49:08.440 --> 49:13.100]  Yeah, no, no wonder you were never able to figure out
[49:13.100 --> 49:14.520]  how to get loose teeth merch.
[49:15.420 --> 49:21.160]  Do you have certain fake names for certain levels of importance?
[49:21.680 --> 49:22.340]  Oh, interesting.
[49:22.700 --> 49:25.420]  Like, do you have like, oh, this is complete nonsense.
[49:25.420 --> 49:27.200]  Here's the fake name for this.
[49:27.480 --> 49:28.960]  And this is oh, you know what?
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.400]  I actually kind of would like to read this.
[49:31.840 --> 49:34.380]  This name is the I would kind of like the read name.
[49:34.880 --> 49:37.880]  Yeah. The more ridiculous the name, the less important it is.
[49:38.540 --> 49:42.380]  If it's like a completely unbelievable name, it's probably not anything important.
[49:43.040 --> 49:45.080]  Interesting. Hmm. Hmm.
[49:45.680 --> 49:46.700]  I don't want to like.
[49:48.140 --> 49:51.960]  I don't want you to have to reveal all of your identities, Bruce Wayne,
[49:51.960 --> 49:57.680]  but it would be fun to play a game in which we have a list of your fake names
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.140]  and have to guess what level of priority each name is.
[50:01.500 --> 50:04.360]  Are any of them named after your famous characters like Stuart?
[50:05.960 --> 50:07.800]  No, no. OK, OK.
[50:08.500 --> 50:09.000]  Too official.
[50:09.980 --> 50:13.120]  Are you going to bring up the game that you want to play with me, Gavin?
[50:13.620 --> 50:13.940]  We're talking.
[50:14.080 --> 50:16.780]  Can I post the screenshots from the insane thing you sent me last night?
[50:17.040 --> 50:18.980]  Yeah, of course. All right. Copy.
[50:19.900 --> 50:21.080]  OK, so Andrew text me.
[50:21.080 --> 50:23.900]  I've had charcuterie on the brain quite a bit recently.
[50:24.720 --> 50:26.320]  Andrew simply text me this out of nowhere.
[50:26.880 --> 50:29.260]  He wrote, I spell it right across my three attempts.
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.500]  And then it's a picture of him.
[50:31.340 --> 50:32.460]  Oh, my God.
[50:32.740 --> 50:36.180]  Writing it, which I immediately wrote, I feel like I'm having a stroke.
[50:36.340 --> 50:37.420]  Why is it written downwards?
[50:37.860 --> 50:41.360]  It looks like the notebooks in the Kevin Spacey wrote in in seven.
[50:47.440 --> 50:48.220]  So that.
[50:49.300 --> 50:52.060]  So then he sent me a screenshot of what it looks like.
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.400]  He's basically dodging the buttons on whatever.
[50:54.660 --> 50:56.260]  Yeah, so the buttons are on the top right.
[50:56.340 --> 50:57.260]  So I couldn't go across.
[50:57.360 --> 50:59.040]  I had to go down and around the buttons.
[50:59.680 --> 51:01.900]  I said, wild. Are you right handed?
[51:02.780 --> 51:03.880]  He said, yes, I am.
[51:03.920 --> 51:06.320]  I said, I feel like and don't take offense to this.
[51:06.600 --> 51:10.140]  I feel like I could write a better with a pen in my anus.
[51:12.020 --> 51:14.060]  So I want to pitch the game to you guys.
[51:14.660 --> 51:16.920]  Andrew or anus? Oh.
[51:17.660 --> 51:19.540]  Well, we both write a word.
[51:20.460 --> 51:22.040]  And that's pretty much it, you have to guess.
[51:22.660 --> 51:25.600]  Why don't any of your letters connect?
[51:25.760 --> 51:27.640]  I'm like looking at like your H's.
[51:27.820 --> 51:29.940]  Those are insane. I'm looking at your R's.
[51:30.160 --> 51:30.940]  Those are insane.
[51:32.140 --> 51:33.680]  You're is it you?
[51:34.320 --> 51:36.040]  Just I'm looking. Yeah.
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.340]  So what happens is I'm a right hand.
[51:40.500 --> 51:41.420]  I'm a right hander.
[51:41.980 --> 51:45.080]  So to do this, I have to hold the phone in my left hand.
[51:45.080 --> 51:48.360]  And I also have I've always just had a little bit of shaky hands.
[51:48.600 --> 51:52.180]  So it's kind of the screen is shaking probably a little bit.
[51:53.280 --> 51:55.780]  And I'm trying to like, I should really be holding it.
[51:55.800 --> 51:58.000]  My left hand is kind of useless, I guess, is what I'm saying.
[51:58.800 --> 52:00.200]  So it's an unstable surface.
[52:00.660 --> 52:05.280]  And I'm also trying to make because I went in knowing I wanted three attempts.
[52:05.300 --> 52:06.220]  So I was trying to balance that.
[52:06.320 --> 52:08.840]  And I also had to try to factor in it curving.
[52:10.200 --> 52:12.600]  So he's that dodging the button so that he says
[52:13.340 --> 52:16.440]  and then he sends me this one where he's dodging the mind table.
[52:16.960 --> 52:18.600]  Like just put a new document.
[52:18.800 --> 52:20.480]  Why do you? Oh, my God.
[52:20.880 --> 52:24.420]  Why are you constantly dodging the the previous thing you used in the app?
[52:27.440 --> 52:28.700]  I, you know,
[52:30.240 --> 52:31.160]  I spell it right now.
[52:31.220 --> 52:34.060]  That was the thing is I was I've been thinking about it a lot.
[52:34.400 --> 52:38.500]  And I didn't I couldn't think of a way to use it without spell auto spell
[52:38.500 --> 52:40.020]  or whatever. Put two T's in.
[52:40.560 --> 52:43.640]  It's almost as if it's a real piece of paper and you just don't want to waste it.
[52:45.880 --> 52:48.980]  But yeah, we're just reusing the same digital image over and over.
[52:49.160 --> 52:51.380]  I don't think you spell it right, because I don't think that's two T's.
[52:51.580 --> 52:53.460]  C-H-A-R-C-U-T-T-E-R.
[52:55.380 --> 52:56.540]  Are any of those right?
[52:57.080 --> 52:59.800]  You want me to spell because you probably can't read what I've written?
[53:00.240 --> 53:02.220]  Yeah. Also, people, there are just people that listen.
[53:02.680 --> 53:06.220]  C-H-A-R-C-U-T-T-E-R-I-E. Wrong.
[53:06.740 --> 53:10.800]  C-H-A-R-C-U-T-E-R-I-E. Right.
[53:11.360 --> 53:15.700]  That's it. C-H-A-R-C-U-T-E-R-Y.
[53:16.160 --> 53:18.440]  Also wrong. You already had it right, so you know that.
[53:18.860 --> 53:19.600]  Yeah. Chakuteri?
[53:20.720 --> 53:22.460]  I've been thinking about it a lot.
[53:24.440 --> 53:27.440]  I feel like it's a word I very rarely see, but hear often.
[53:28.520 --> 53:29.980]  I just wanted to try also.
[53:30.720 --> 53:31.900]  That's pretty legible, right?
[53:32.260 --> 53:33.640]  That's not bad. Was that your anus?
[53:34.040 --> 53:37.780]  No, unfortunately, it was a finger on like Instagram.
[53:38.140 --> 53:40.460]  So next time I'll try it with anus.
[53:40.800 --> 53:42.660]  Are you right handed or left handed?
[53:42.820 --> 53:43.900]  I am right handed.
[53:44.460 --> 53:45.900]  Hmm. Yeah. Does that make it?
[53:45.940 --> 53:47.460]  Does that does that help or hinder?
[53:48.600 --> 53:49.520]  I'm not sure.
[53:49.720 --> 53:52.140]  Can you send me that black space you're using and I can.
[53:52.620 --> 53:55.200]  It is a photo of my desk.
[53:55.820 --> 53:57.560]  Oh, black space.
[53:57.860 --> 53:59.460]  Is that what you're talking about?
[53:59.720 --> 54:00.520]  Like the background?
[54:01.020 --> 54:03.260]  I just took a picture very close of my desk.
[54:03.760 --> 54:06.680]  Now everything he draws and writes is going to be on your desk.
[54:10.800 --> 54:13.060]  They didn't send it, so I just had to take one of my laptop.
[54:13.340 --> 54:17.020]  OK, it's going to be it's going to be him writing on your desk
[54:17.020 --> 54:18.940]  with your original writing scribbled out next.
[54:19.040 --> 54:23.400]  Yeah, it's I just wanted to see if it would fit up and down,
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.960]  if my lettering made sense.
[54:25.440 --> 54:27.940]  I think the only thing you're going to really lock in everything else is cool.
[54:28.100 --> 54:29.620]  I don't know. I'm going to actually try.
[54:30.500 --> 54:35.160]  OK, I need to find a way to hold a pen without actually putting it in my ass.
[54:35.660 --> 54:37.360]  I have a way to do that.
[54:37.440 --> 54:38.220]  Oh, in your hand?
[54:40.080 --> 54:43.660]  And in a second, I'm spelling and.
[54:45.600 --> 54:48.580]  Yeah, yeah, shit out there.
[54:48.760 --> 54:51.080]  He or I.
[54:52.420 --> 54:53.320]  There you go.
[54:53.400 --> 54:54.060]  I'm excited about this.
[54:54.820 --> 54:56.220]  Couldn't save image. Why not?
[54:56.860 --> 54:57.400]  Oh, here we go.
[54:58.580 --> 55:00.720]  OK, my idea, Gavin.
[55:01.260 --> 55:05.980]  Yeah, not a pen, but you plunge your butt
[55:06.580 --> 55:08.460]  and then you dip the wooden part
[55:09.800 --> 55:12.860]  in ink. Plunge my butt.
[55:13.640 --> 55:15.560]  Oh, oh, like I suction my ass.
[55:15.840 --> 55:20.420]  You suction your ass with the plunger and then you dip the wooden part.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.960]  This Homer Simpson ass way of like, yeah, you're going to you're going to try this.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.340]  It's going to seem all fine to you.
[55:28.380 --> 55:31.200]  Try to pull the plunger off and you prolapse your own asshole.
[55:31.500 --> 55:32.540]  That's not my problem.
[55:32.660 --> 55:35.300]  I was just trying to think of how Gavin could accomplish this
[55:35.300 --> 55:37.400]  without shoving something in his ass.
[55:37.860 --> 55:38.520]  It's the best thing.
[55:38.520 --> 55:42.240]  Maybe I'll get in the lab and I'll I'll craft some writable underwear.
[55:43.940 --> 55:47.800]  OK, I have a I've been avoiding asking a very obvious question, Andrew,
[55:48.080 --> 55:49.760]  and I feel like maybe I should just ask it.
[55:50.440 --> 55:52.000]  Why don't you turn the phone sideways?
[55:53.380 --> 55:54.260]  Can you do that?
[55:54.540 --> 55:55.620]  Oh, my God.
[55:56.080 --> 55:58.080]  I'm about to fucking lose it.
[55:58.560 --> 56:00.500]  Wait a second.
[56:00.960 --> 56:02.080]  Is that how you did it, Eric?
[56:03.140 --> 56:04.180]  No, it's this portrait.
[56:04.180 --> 56:05.240]  I'm just. No, what?
[56:05.360 --> 56:05.920]  It's up and down.
[56:06.040 --> 56:08.580]  I did it like you did to prove that somebody could do it,
[56:08.640 --> 56:10.960]  not make it look like a monkey made it.
[56:13.640 --> 56:17.140]  Just so just turn it sideways so you'd write like a well, normal.
[56:17.520 --> 56:18.620]  Yeah. Yeah.
[56:20.200 --> 56:22.200]  Oh, it doesn't make this is actually worse.
[56:22.220 --> 56:23.520]  I'm not used to this at all.
[56:23.980 --> 56:24.600]  How's it different?
[56:25.080 --> 56:26.140]  You just got more travel.
[56:26.700 --> 56:27.320]  Oh, no.
[56:27.440 --> 56:29.520]  Now I'm running up against the colors at the bottom.
[56:31.360 --> 56:33.560]  Surely you could just tap those away or something.
[56:33.560 --> 56:34.560]  You can't.
[56:35.640 --> 56:37.180]  Why are you right at the bottom, though?
[56:37.480 --> 56:38.960]  Oh, you mean like the right?
[56:39.140 --> 56:39.480]  I'll show you.
[56:40.820 --> 56:43.720]  I screenshotted it and then we can move on.
[56:44.940 --> 56:46.400]  See, I ran into the colors at the bottom.
[56:49.360 --> 56:52.480]  How did you write so much bigger?
[56:53.080 --> 56:55.420]  Also, why did you start at the top?
[56:56.400 --> 56:56.660]  Yeah.
[56:57.660 --> 56:59.800]  You started like an inch below the top.
[57:02.480 --> 57:04.500]  Well, yeah, yeah, I did.
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.160]  I started where the light began, and I guess that was my problem.
[57:11.500 --> 57:13.400]  Anyway, I think people would struggle.
[57:14.840 --> 57:15.960]  Well, we all have skills.
[57:16.380 --> 57:17.340]  This one isn't one of mine.
[57:20.220 --> 57:22.700]  So, OK, did you learn?
[57:22.860 --> 57:24.580]  Did you learn handwriting at school?
[57:25.080 --> 57:26.180]  Yeah, I'm great at that.
[57:27.100 --> 57:27.640]  Are you sure?
[57:27.880 --> 57:29.200]  Yeah, I can only do cursive.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.040]  Then why haven't you been doing it in cursive?
[57:33.200 --> 57:36.140]  Can you write charcuterie in cursive for us real fast?
[57:36.900 --> 57:37.600]  I don't know how to.
[57:37.680 --> 57:39.560]  I mean, this is I feel like I don't know how to do cursive.
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.120]  No, I'm great at doing cursive.
[57:42.800 --> 57:44.860]  I've never done it with just a finger before.
[57:45.040 --> 57:48.460]  Oh, I've I've only ever I only know how to do it in cursive.
[57:48.580 --> 57:49.320]  Can you write in cursive?
[57:49.460 --> 57:50.920]  Oh, shit. They called my bluff.
[57:51.680 --> 57:53.680]  But the perfect plan falling apart.
[57:55.440 --> 57:56.740]  I'll next time I'll do it.
[57:56.740 --> 57:59.860]  I'll reveal. I feel like the next time.
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.340]  Well, is this too visual?
[58:01.400 --> 58:02.480]  I'm worried about it being too visual.
[58:02.620 --> 58:04.800]  We're a podcast. I don't care at all.
[58:05.040 --> 58:07.340]  Do it. OK, OK, I'll do it.
[58:07.420 --> 58:09.140]  OK, I'll do it.
[58:09.280 --> 58:11.380]  Shelby's going to post all these pictures.
[58:12.240 --> 58:15.400]  And so people will be able to see on our Instagram or wherever.
[58:15.800 --> 58:16.920]  They'll also be in the video.
[58:17.200 --> 58:21.020]  But I need people to see like this has to be seen.
[58:21.100 --> 58:23.100]  It must be seen. I don't want to wait.
[58:23.100 --> 58:29.120]  I can't continue on and living my life without seeing Andrew right in cursive.
[58:29.120 --> 58:33.640]  I agree. Are you are you cursing on the soy phone or what is it?
[58:33.960 --> 58:34.940]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[58:35.060 --> 58:37.240]  Soy phone. Slippery fucking phone.
[58:37.640 --> 58:42.920]  That phone falls off my end table three times a night.
[58:44.240 --> 58:46.960]  I did dip it in lube before I mailed it.
[58:49.160 --> 58:49.340]  What?
[58:49.680 --> 58:50.680]  Wipe that off, you know?
[58:50.740 --> 58:52.520]  Are you holding the phone just up in the air?
[58:52.520 --> 58:55.240]  Would it be more stable if you did it on the desk?
[58:55.660 --> 58:58.720]  Probably. I'm not running charcuterie for 70 more times.
[58:59.320 --> 59:00.280]  This is my last charcuterie.
[59:00.600 --> 59:02.000]  Don't say that. Yeah, we're not sure.
[59:03.580 --> 59:04.100]  Let's see how you do.
[59:04.120 --> 59:05.920]  That was a quick. That was just a quick run through.
[59:07.880 --> 59:08.680]  That's better.
[59:09.420 --> 59:10.220]  Is where's this?
[59:10.620 --> 59:11.280]  Where's the C?
[59:12.220 --> 59:14.200]  It looks like it says Everstein.
[59:14.800 --> 59:17.060]  Yeah, it does look like it says Everstein.
[59:17.080 --> 59:18.820]  It does look like it says Everstein.
[59:18.920 --> 59:21.860]  That's my favorite rock punk group.
[59:22.460 --> 59:22.900]  Everstein.
[59:23.100 --> 59:25.680]  Well, I think it's the new Peter Molyneux game.
[59:25.760 --> 59:29.180]  I believe it's the new Steve's Blood or whatever that was.
[59:29.800 --> 59:32.280]  Steve's Blood and Everstein are going on tour.
[59:32.740 --> 59:33.180]  Bloody Steve. Bloody Steve.
[59:33.620 --> 59:34.820]  This is Everstein.
[59:37.520 --> 59:38.400]  Summer 2026.
[59:38.540 --> 59:40.220]  You guys get sleep amnesia?
[59:40.280 --> 59:42.120]  What's sleep? That's like you don't remember your dreams?
[59:42.540 --> 59:43.920]  No, it's like I.
[59:45.300 --> 59:48.520]  I have like a small window of time where I don't remember anything
[59:48.520 --> 59:50.300]  if I get woken up out of it.
[59:50.940 --> 59:53.360]  Probably like five minutes on either side.
[59:53.880 --> 59:55.120]  Wait, wait, wait.
[59:55.140 --> 59:58.120]  So you just don't know who or where you are for five minutes?
[59:58.360 --> 59:58.820]  No, no, no, no.
[59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.000]  Like somebody if I'm in a deep sleep.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.360]  Yeah, that was my life every day.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:07.080]  Every day he wakes up and he's terrified.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.780]  Not again. Not again.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.020]  Just like sat in a corner with your arms around your knees.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.200]  Every day I'm just looking around like, where the fuck am I?
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.880]  Instead of 50 first dates, it's five terrifying fucking minutes.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:27.100]  And I have a thing where like if I'm in a deep sleep and somebody wakes me up,
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.720]  they can have a conversation with me.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.920]  If I go back to sleep, that's gone.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.860]  I've erased that.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:32.980]  That that doesn't exist.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:35.780]  OK, so you're like partially asleep still, probably.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:36.920]  Probably. Yeah.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.200]  But I've always been like this.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.500]  I just I'll clear that thing.
[01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.900]  I have developed a new habit, which I don't know how this has happened,
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:46.540]  but it's caused great issue.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.940]  It started, well, it didn't start, but it impacted the first night
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:54.800]  of Mario Party March, where I am bringing my phone into the bed
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:58.260]  to use it and not remembering I'm doing that and then falling asleep.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.720]  And it's just somewhere in the bed, which with my blanket situation
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.620]  has become a real problem, trying to rediscover the phone.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.860]  I keep going to reach for my phone to check something
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:13.000]  on the end table at my bed, bedside table and table.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:13.620]  Is it an end table?
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.140]  Doesn't matter. Anyway, it's not there, man.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.280]  You're the head of the table.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.280]  So whatever you want it to be.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.360]  Yeah. Head of the nightstand.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.500]  It's not there.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.120]  And I need to.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.900]  How do I train myself out of this?
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.360]  It's something I've been meaning to ask you guys.
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.300]  Do you have any approaches or techniques?
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.620]  I keep grabbing to remember better.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.640]  Well, I don't I don't I can't.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.920]  Maybe I need to, like, tape the phone down.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.100]  Take echinacea.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.200]  Why don't you leave it plugged in and then you'll know where it is
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.080]  because it's just follow the wire. Yeah.
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.280]  That's actually a really good point.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.620]  That's what I do.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:45.680]  That's smart.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.400]  The problem is my wire is like 20 feet long.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.600]  It's a really long wire.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.440]  That's great. It's perfect. Even better.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.640]  It is. Yeah. I'm not going to pull it out.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.760]  I have a request.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.240]  OK. We do a little segment called a five minute interview with Andrew,
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.120]  and it starts the first second you wake up.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.020]  I like this.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.340]  And we have to see if you remember it afterwards.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.580]  I like this. Yeah, that's great.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.520]  How will he know to get on if for five minutes he just doesn't have to list
[01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.260]  his partner? Yeah.
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:19.200]  And maybe we'll start at like 4.30 a.m.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.400]  You just get shoved awake.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.560]  The mic's already recording and your headphones are already on and we just go.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:26.220]  This could be interesting.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.400]  I think it would have to
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.720]  you'd have to it would have to be through them.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.840]  I can't know about it.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.480]  It can't be a thing that I'm waiting for because then I'll be like,
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.780]  just kind of alert for it.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.420]  Yeah, you'll be freaking out just waiting for 4.30.
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:42.880]  If you do it in like three months from now where I've forgotten about this premise,
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.280]  I think I'm going to write down.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:50.080]  Because I I'm like, apparently I'm getting into conversations.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.240]  I'm putting it on the idea bank right now.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.620]  It's probably like talking to you at your purest, most base level,
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.720]  deep, deep subconscious.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.640]  Well, sometimes it can be terrifying because I
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.840]  what did I do?
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.980]  I did something that I apologized for and they said,
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.360]  I thought you're going to apologize for when you hit my phone.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.420]  I was like, what?
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.640]  Hit your phone?
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.540]  And I guess I slapped the phone out of their hands in my.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.940]  Whoa, whoa.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.140]  I was not in like I did, like I swung my I wasn't aiming at the phone.
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:20.920]  I wasn't aiming at anything.
[01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.120]  My arm just swung.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.240]  Oh, I swing in my sleep, I guess.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.540]  Like like I jolt, not so much swing, but like I jolt
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:34.300]  and I knocked the phone out and then I commented about like I apologized
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.900]  at the time, but I just had no memory of it.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.840]  How do you swing on the edge?
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:42.720]  Dangerous. Oh, yeah.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.940]  Well, it could be a problem or sometimes like maybe I'll
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:49.700]  like fall asleep holding their arm
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:54.980]  and then as I'll jolt and or my hand will, I guess, progressively
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.800]  go higher up the hand to the point where I'm pushing the phone out.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.660]  I'm a menace, I guess, I don't know.
[01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:02.320]  I don't understand.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.900]  This sleep in general, just all around, it's bad for me.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.400]  Sounds like a nightmare.
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:16.600]  Absolute nightmare.
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.400]  Sleeping gets more difficult, I think, as you get older.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.780]  Yeah. Really? Really?
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.460]  Yes. Does it get easier for you?
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.500]  I yeah, it really has gotten easier as I've gotten older.
[01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:28.640]  I don't have issues.
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.420]  I mean, I get to get up to pee more, but sleep is easy.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.600]  I sleep. I go to sleep easier.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.480]  I wake up happier, better.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.300]  I sleep through the night better.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.200]  Yeah, I don't have now for you, Geoff.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.860]  Do you think sleep has gotten easier or everything around it has gotten harder?
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.140]  Is your school in Gerplers everywhere?
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.500]  You're on the floor.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.860]  Like, I just feel like everything around the sleep has gotten a lot more difficult.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.040]  Honestly, my sleep got like instantly better the day I got sober.
[01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.300]  And then it just has continued to improve since then.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.760]  Oh, that's great.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.820]  So I think it's probably, you know.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.260]  I'm pretty sure that drunken sleep is almost worthless.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.540]  It's like, yeah, not regenerative.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.220]  But yeah, like I used to have bad insomnia and stuff, and I don't anymore.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.220]  I just go to sleep immediately.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:16.740]  I never had I know I can't remember the last time I like laid awake,
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.100]  not able to fall asleep.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.520]  That hasn't happened to me in years.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:23.200]  Hmm. Well, I'm trying to CPAP set up, so I'll give an update.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.340]  Maybe these things will change.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.780]  Maybe things will shift.
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.580]  I'm so fascinated to see how you get on with it.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:31.340]  Yeah, so am I. It's the worst.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.640]  My advice is stick with it.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.380]  I got I hated it so much that I just didn't use it for like a year.
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:38.240]  But I should have.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.140]  Yeah, I don't think I'll have that problem.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:43.320]  God, can you imagine how much better you could have been last year if you'd used it?
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.480]  I used to think about if I lived in a different continent
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.660]  that I would be unstoppable.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:50.960]  What? What? What?
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:55.200]  You say shit out of nowhere
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.740]  that is like so mind blowing to me.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.320]  It's related to what he's saying, where there is a time in my life
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.720]  where I would be at peak energy from like three a.m.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.800]  through like 10 a.m.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.900]  And it was useless because everyone else is sleeping where I'm at.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.580]  Like there's no I'm not utilizing that well.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.580]  But if I lived in a different part of the world, I'm just I'm just
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.380]  I'm being held back by where I'm living.
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.840]  Well, people do have different like genetic circadian rhythms, I think.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.340]  Really? Yeah.
[01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.600]  I just think I had a bad sleep schedule.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.560]  I don't think I could blame the circadias for that.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.880]  I can kind of see what you're saying.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.720]  You think it's like cicadas?
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:37.900]  Do you think it's like an animal?
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:39.940]  Whatever.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.920]  My life goes on.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.220]  Just not as well as it would if you were in Australia.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.240]  Exactly.
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.980]  I always felt like I was held back by being born in Alabama.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.180]  I well, that's I agree.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.480]  I mean, we all agree with you on that there, buddy.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.560]  Yeah, that always seemed like unnecessarily unfair.
[01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.940]  How old are you when you looked around for the first time and just went,
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.180]  who, me? Yeah.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.320]  Oh, pretty young, man. Pretty fucking young.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.700]  I shit my shit, my pants in the mud.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.280]  And I went, this is it, huh?
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:18.120]  I didn't. It was I I went and lived in Florida for a little while
[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:21.100]  where, like, everybody was into skating and surfing and shit.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.360]  And it was like that culture, very like Bones Brigade, early 80s.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.920]  And then I had to move back to Alabama and like fifth or sixth grade.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.100]  And that's when I knew.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.120]  That's when I went, oh, my God, I've moved back in time.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.100]  I live in a different time now.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:37.020]  And this time hates me.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.240]  Now it's pretty much the rest of my childhood.
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.660]  God, I laughed my ass off this episode.
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.420]  This is definitely a good one.
[01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:45.640]  It's pretty fucking funny.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.200]  This is like old face.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.800]  Yeah, this is just getting charcuterie.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.420]  So many different fucking times.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.580]  There's like five images of it.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:54.540]  It's so funny.
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:56.040]  It's so insane.
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.440]  Speaking of old face, before we end, I want to let you guys know
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:02.560]  I've been playing trucks and it works.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:06.840]  What? Yeah, I think it might be time to go back to trucks.
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.940]  Burndog and Antonio and I started playing trucks again, and it's been working.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.140]  Wow. Let's do it.
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.560]  We got a new trucks game coming out, too.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.120]  That looks. Yeah.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:15.880]  Was it like a change or like what happened?
[01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:21.380]  I mean, the game's constantly updated and there's I've checked the the the subreddit
[01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.280]  and nobody's complaining about getting dropped anymore.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.580]  I can't find any like threads where people are like actively bitching about it.
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:28.260]  And it just seems to be working.
[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.000]  So just throwing that out there.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:30.980]  We could maybe play trucks.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.160]  We should get back into trucks.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.780]  That's crazy, because I I played COD with you guys the other night
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.680]  with all the truck boys and all four of us got dropped from COD.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.180]  It's true. It's true.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.060]  Oh, man. Did I tell you guys last week about how I've started to fall
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.120]  asleep in video games again?
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.480]  Dude, we were talking about it off mic.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:56.000]  I was fucking playing Warzone with Bernie and Antonio the other night
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.780]  and we were looting a house.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.620]  And then the next thing I knew, I woke up and I was halfway across the map
[01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.940]  from them just running through down the side of a mountain.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.800]  Had no idea how I got there.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.020]  They didn't even notice because they were arguing with each other about something.
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.820]  And I just like I fucking I felt like it was 2010
[01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:16.400]  and you were carrying me across the finish line again in crackdown.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:19.920]  Did you maybe while you were looking at the house?
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.140]  Did you look at the bed in there?
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.400]  I just maybe I did.
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.480]  I just want to play so bad, but we can we play so late at night.
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.660]  It sucks. Yeah, don't play so late because because of Mario Party March,
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.820]  every night is a school night.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.800]  I know it sucks. Even even Saturday and Sunday.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.520]  I know there's no escape.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.780]  There's zero escape.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.560]  But I get so excited 30 minutes before, though.
[01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:44.280]  Like once once it's like, oh, the turn is coming up.
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.220]  This is going to be big.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.200]  I got big things planned for this turn.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.060]  I'm having so much fun with Mario Party.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.080]  Yeah, so we're in at the time of this recording, we just did part seven.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.780]  Day seven. Day seven.
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:55.940]  Yeah, we recorded it.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.760]  It's it's really it's really heated up.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.940]  And to those who haven't been watching it, it's posted every day on our Patreon.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:02.740]  For free.
[01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:07.520]  I went back and I can confirm that I just don't read.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.300]  Just don't read in that game.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.160]  Oh, Christ.
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.400]  Yeah, that game. Yeah.
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:20.520]  Oh, we we should probably wrap this up
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:24.140]  or I'm going to start launching into new prompts and that's going to piss Eric off.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:24.900]  Yeah, no, we need to.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:28.640]  Because I I'm yeah, because I want to save it.
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:30.580]  Save it for next week. All right.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.300]  Oh, thanks for listening to another episode of the regulation podcast.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.100]  It was episode 44.
[01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.960]  Jesus Christ, we hope you liked it.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:39.960]  We sure did.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.860]  Laughed our little dicks off.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.820]  They're on the ground somewhere.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.740]  Everybody's as soon as we stop recording, we stop down, as we call it in the industry.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.140]  Everybody's going to get on their hands and knees and start searching
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:52.360]  for their little dicks again, because they always roll under something
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.040]  and then they get caught up in dust bunnies and stuff.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.900]  Then you got to go take and wash your little dick off before you put it back on.
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.920]  It's a whole thing. Anyway, we'll see you next week.
