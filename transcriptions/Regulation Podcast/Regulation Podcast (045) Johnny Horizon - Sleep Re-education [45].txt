[00:00.000 --> 00:05.980]  Hello and welcome to Regulation Podcast episode number 45. I'm your temporary host,
[00:06.220 --> 00:11.260]  The Mechanic, joined by Baby Pepsi, Gassy Goo, Gizmo, and Lil Ricky B.
[00:12.640 --> 00:16.240]  As always, thanks for joining us this week. Guys, did you know that you can inhale popcorn?
[00:21.000 --> 00:24.280]  You can eat it through your lung? What do you mean?
[00:24.400 --> 00:29.420]  Yeah, so if you're eating it and you take it in wrong, if you inhale at the moment,
[00:29.420 --> 00:32.680]  you can take a kernel and then suck it into your lung.
[00:32.840 --> 00:33.760]  Are you referring to the seed?
[00:34.460 --> 00:38.540]  Yeah, uh, like the little bit in the middle. I mean, you could probably do a whole one if
[00:38.540 --> 00:43.020]  you wanted to, but the bit in the middle. The bit in the middle is the bit that you eat, though.
[00:43.460 --> 00:45.060]  Well, yeah, but you can also inhale it.
[00:45.120 --> 00:45.780]  Yeah, it's light as air.
[00:46.120 --> 00:46.360]  Right.
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.920]  So you'll say you can inhale a whole kernel?
[00:49.380 --> 00:52.920]  You can inhale a whole kernel and can get very sick and apparently succeed.
[00:53.120 --> 00:56.280]  Yeah, and then corn grows in your stomach and you die. I heard about this.
[00:56.940 --> 01:00.640]  Now, Nick, is there corn growing in your stomach right now?
[01:00.940 --> 01:04.960]  Not at the moment, no. But I did also... listen, my wife is on a big kick about learning about
[01:04.960 --> 01:08.860]  foods because, you know, kids and eating all that stuff. And the other thing, apparently,
[01:08.980 --> 01:11.680]  that you can die on the easiest is a hot dog.
[01:11.700 --> 01:12.360]  Y'all are eating kids?
[01:13.520 --> 01:13.920]  What?
[01:14.320 --> 01:15.220]  I said kids and eating.
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.060]  Kids and eating? Eating kids?
[01:17.340 --> 01:17.840]  Eating kids.
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.540]  So you're just... your wife's looking for things not to feed Archie so he doesn't die?
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.500]  Essentially, we did find out because he had his first hot dog this past weekend. I was
[01:27.500 --> 01:30.520]  pretty proud and excited. I'm going to get him a counter here pretty soon. Make sure
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.360]  he keeps up with the rest of us. But apparently...
[01:35.360 --> 01:38.080]  That's the craziest... this kid's like three.
[01:38.460 --> 01:40.220]  Yo, so have you eaten your 80 hot dogs or what?
[01:40.540 --> 01:44.260]  No, but this is great because most people don't know how many hot dogs they've eaten in their life.
[01:44.640 --> 01:45.800]  And you actually could.
[01:46.480 --> 01:48.460]  He gets to start from scratch.
[01:48.480 --> 01:49.200]  That's pretty cool.
[01:49.560 --> 01:50.220]  Stats on dogs.
[01:50.600 --> 01:51.000]  Insane.
[01:51.020 --> 01:51.600]  Oh my god.
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.760]  Teach him from an early age about the lifetime hot dog counter and how it's his responsibility
[01:56.760 --> 01:58.660]  to keep up with it.
[01:58.980 --> 02:03.020]  It does make sense, though, that you're most likely to choke on a dog because eating a
[02:03.020 --> 02:05.360]  hot dog is like eating an inverse throat.
[02:05.880 --> 02:10.440]  Yes, it's the exact same size as your throat. So most people cut it down the middle, which
[02:10.440 --> 02:13.100]  is why some restaurants serve it that way and some restaurants just serve it that way
[02:13.100 --> 02:14.280]  because they cook it that way.
[02:14.420 --> 02:16.800]  Otherwise, you're just eating a cooked throat plug.
[02:17.100 --> 02:18.840]  It is. It's like the pile to the hole.
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.160]  How high would you say Archie could count, Nick?
[02:22.740 --> 02:23.680]  I don't know, 20s?
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.980]  Well, he's ahead of you, Andrew.
[02:26.260 --> 02:28.320]  Uh, about 80s, 90s.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.440]  I just I appreciate that Archie lives in a world. I don't know.
[02:33.140 --> 02:36.240]  Remember the Mr. Show sketch where like 23 is the highest number?
[02:36.540 --> 02:37.540]  That's gonna be Archie.
[02:37.820 --> 02:40.820]  He's gonna have 23 hot dogs in a calendar year and be like, that's it.
[02:41.080 --> 02:41.820]  I've gone the highest.
[02:42.040 --> 02:42.400]  I've peaked.
[02:43.360 --> 02:45.300]  If I eat another hot dog, it just isn't a number.
[02:45.420 --> 02:46.460]  We have to invent something else.
[02:46.460 --> 02:52.140]  If you said I had 23 hot dogs left to eat total, I think I'd be fine with that.
[02:52.340 --> 02:52.720]  Like in your life?
[02:52.740 --> 02:54.860]  Yeah, that would mean that you lived 5,000 years.
[02:58.220 --> 03:01.580]  You went to $1 hot dog night and had one hot dog.
[03:01.900 --> 03:03.620]  Gavin just found his secret to immortality.
[03:04.860 --> 03:06.520]  Just never eat the 23rd dog.
[03:08.600 --> 03:11.440]  It'll be 50 years before you eat the third dog, for Christ's sake.
[03:13.040 --> 03:16.980]  Nick, I gotta say, buddy, I thought that was a fantastic intro.
[03:17.100 --> 03:20.820]  Anytime you want to step in and do the intro again, it's the floor is yours.
[03:21.160 --> 03:22.840]  I'll let you know when I have a factoid next.
[03:23.020 --> 03:23.300]  All right.
[03:23.620 --> 03:25.820]  It reminded me of Kermit the Frog a little bit for some reason.
[03:25.900 --> 03:29.560]  I don't know why, but it kind of gave me some Kermit vibes on the Muppet Show and I liked it.
[03:29.580 --> 03:31.180]  Well, I kind of don't want to do it now, I guess.
[03:31.820 --> 03:33.340]  Welcome to Regulation Podcast.
[03:33.720 --> 03:35.700]  I think Nick is feeling on top of the world.
[03:35.860 --> 03:40.940]  That was crazy after that intro, but also he's given away the fact that he's not wearing the
[03:40.940 --> 03:42.400]  mask. So I feel like...
[03:42.400 --> 03:42.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:43.000 --> 03:43.500]  Oh, wow.
[03:43.560 --> 03:44.080]  Kind of a...
[03:44.080 --> 03:44.680]  What a trick.
[03:44.880 --> 03:45.880]  We tricked you there a little bit.
[03:46.240 --> 03:46.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:47.960 --> 03:50.140]  Is that what you thought Kermit the Frog sounded like, Nick?
[03:51.180 --> 03:51.580]  No.
[03:58.580 --> 04:00.680]  Sounds like the orangutan that show we watch.
[04:05.620 --> 04:07.040]  Are you Mr. Smith?
[04:11.020 --> 04:12.500]  Kermit's last name is actually Smith.
[04:13.520 --> 04:14.320]  Oh, Christ.
[04:15.500 --> 04:17.100]  What do you guys want to talk about today?
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.300]  Does anybody have anything on their list?
[04:18.500 --> 04:18.940]  Are you kidding?
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.960]  You guys have been locked and loaded all week.
[04:21.040 --> 04:22.600]  Somebody just throw something out there.
[04:22.700 --> 04:25.300]  Well, I got two things, but I want to give everybody else the floor first.
[04:25.740 --> 04:28.760]  Gavin, last time we recorded, said he didn't hit any of his notes.
[04:28.900 --> 04:29.960]  I feel like Gavin should...
[04:29.960 --> 04:31.600]  Gavin, lead us off, buddy.
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.260]  Mail my semen to every house.
[04:34.340 --> 04:34.960]  What do I mean by that?
[04:36.620 --> 04:37.380]  Dude, all right.
[04:37.440 --> 04:39.360]  So no more Gavin notes ever.
[04:40.200 --> 04:40.720]  Move on, I guess.
[04:41.100 --> 04:42.880]  Mail my semen to every...
[04:42.880 --> 04:44.560]  No, let's linger on this for a minute.
[04:45.200 --> 04:46.200]  Let's think about this.
[04:46.200 --> 04:47.260]  This is my crime thing.
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.040]  Like if my semen was everywhere, I could never be caught for a crime.
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.200]  But then I realized all of the semen-based crimes are really not fun.
[04:54.720 --> 04:58.100]  Yeah, why would you want to cover up a semen-based crime?
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.500]  It would make more sense if you decided to go touch a doorknob at every house in America.
[05:06.700 --> 05:09.440]  Yeah, like it should be mailing my fingerprints to every house.
[05:09.700 --> 05:12.820]  But you took it to sexual assault pretty quickly.
[05:13.440 --> 05:14.860]  It could have also been murder, I guess.
[05:14.860 --> 05:17.460]  Have you seen... have you seen The Town?
[05:18.140 --> 05:21.920]  Remember how like they do the heist and then they like get a bunch of different hair from
[05:21.920 --> 05:24.940]  a barber shop of like various people to like fuck up the DNA?
[05:25.500 --> 05:30.300]  Like what you're suggesting is like a bag of cum, but it's a bunch of different dudes cum.
[05:30.920 --> 05:32.240]  Throw the cum bomb in.
[05:32.300 --> 05:34.820]  So it's like there's an orgy of dudes here.
[05:34.960 --> 05:37.460]  How do we... whose DNA is whose?
[05:37.620 --> 05:39.700]  I was just trying to get... I was just trying to blanket my DNA.
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.160]  Yeah, I don't think... because what you're actually doing with your initial suggestion
[05:43.160 --> 05:46.540]  is putting yourself as a suspect in every single crime.
[05:46.840 --> 05:48.720]  Yeah, but they'll be like, oh, it's this guy again.
[05:49.100 --> 05:49.500]  Yeah.
[05:50.140 --> 05:51.120]  I can build a reputation.
[05:51.300 --> 05:53.780]  They would get real sick of interviewing you after about two weeks.
[05:55.040 --> 05:57.900]  Where were you last night? I was here being interviewed by you.
[06:01.000 --> 06:02.880]  How did his cum get to California?
[06:04.520 --> 06:04.920]  Insane.
[06:05.960 --> 06:07.260]  Gavin, what else you got besides cum?
[06:07.660 --> 06:11.860]  I want to know because Nick is a freak, right? And we've been learning this a lot more recently.
[06:11.860 --> 06:16.510]  I want to know if Nick and Eric ever just hang out one on one.
[06:18.440 --> 06:21.260]  When have we done that? When have we...
[06:21.260 --> 06:24.240]  Very different answers just out the gate.
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.040]  I invited you to a soccer game, but you weren't able to go,
[06:28.200 --> 06:32.900]  which was also good because I wasn't able to go because it felt like I got hit by a bus.
[06:33.180 --> 06:33.880]  Wait, what?
[06:34.520 --> 06:37.240]  That was on Saturday, so...
[06:37.240 --> 06:38.140]  That was barbecue day.
[06:38.140 --> 06:44.660]  Yeah, that was a lot, but we've gone to basketball games.
[06:44.980 --> 06:48.480]  Yeah, and we used to go to lunch when we were all in the same office.
[06:48.580 --> 06:48.700]  Yep.
[06:48.780 --> 06:50.500]  But just you and him at lunch.
[06:50.580 --> 06:50.720]  Yeah.
[06:50.960 --> 06:51.860]  Just the two of you.
[06:51.960 --> 06:55.780]  Yeah, we've done stuff like that before. Yeah, me and Nick get along really well.
[06:55.840 --> 06:59.120]  We're sports guys. We have stuff that we can talk about like that forever.
[06:59.400 --> 07:04.040]  Would you be willing to do it again for us and record the conversation?
[07:04.040 --> 07:06.060]  I don't even want to watch. I just want to listen to the conversation.
[07:06.200 --> 07:07.580]  Have you guys just put a Zoom recorder down?
[07:08.020 --> 07:08.380]  Sure.
[07:08.440 --> 07:12.560]  Yeah, but how much more fun would it be if we were in like a different car park with binoculars
[07:12.560 --> 07:14.700]  and we had a mic on their table?
[07:15.160 --> 07:18.400]  Is that what you think fun is? Is that what you do for fun?
[07:18.480 --> 07:19.340]  Does that sound fun? Yes.
[07:19.560 --> 07:24.180]  How do we record? No, no, I'm into this. I'm 100% into this. How do we record the binocular view?
[07:24.780 --> 07:27.780]  Oh, you can get binoculars with a sensor in, I think.
[07:27.820 --> 07:29.120]  Oh, like smart binoculars.
[07:29.300 --> 07:29.520]  Yeah.
[07:31.060 --> 07:37.820]  Oh, can we do can we do a bird's eye lunch of Nick and Eric where we get smart binoculars?
[07:37.960 --> 07:40.320]  Can we actually do this? This could be a this could be a supplemental.
[07:41.080 --> 07:43.160]  Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't know that it's a very good supplemental,
[07:43.320 --> 07:44.620]  but we could definitely do it.
[07:44.720 --> 07:47.600]  Well, it could be we could all be mics like Geoff and I could
[07:47.600 --> 07:50.100]  sometimes talk about what you guys are talking about.
[07:50.760 --> 07:52.200]  Why do you want to cook their lunch?
[07:52.520 --> 07:54.900]  Yeah, I don't. Yeah, it's really something.
[07:55.220 --> 07:56.140]  No, I'm into this.
[07:56.140 --> 07:59.200]  Lunch cooks. I think they're cooking themselves.
[07:59.660 --> 08:03.680]  We could we could bring a couple of like packed lunches to watch you eat.
[08:04.100 --> 08:07.740]  Yeah. Once again, this is only makes it weirder. I feel like this is you've
[08:07.740 --> 08:09.700]  you've turned this into a weird you thing.
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.340]  No, it'd be like a stakeout podcast.
[08:11.740 --> 08:14.580]  Yes. Yes. This is a stakeout podcast.
[08:14.820 --> 08:18.140]  Speaking of steaks, we should get steaks. You guys watch us through the window.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.180]  Yeah, I'm finally getting steaks.
[08:19.300 --> 08:25.380]  I feel like a key part of the stakeout is that the people being staked aren't aware of the stakeout.
[08:25.380 --> 08:26.700]  Well, here's here's the thing.
[08:27.020 --> 08:29.020]  Maybe they won't know which lunch we're pervert on.
[08:29.320 --> 08:32.500]  Also, Andrew, sometimes in the movie, they are aware of the stakeout
[08:32.500 --> 08:35.400]  and they're feeding false information. So yeah, we don't know.
[08:35.720 --> 08:39.400]  Someone could be sneaking around behind us and putting a banana up our car.
[08:39.780 --> 08:42.120]  Here's what we do. They exactly. Axel Foley style.
[08:42.560 --> 08:45.600]  They they eat steak for lunch.
[08:45.720 --> 08:49.920]  We watch and record while we eat Philly cheese steaks in the car.
[08:50.660 --> 08:51.760]  Philly cheese stakeout?
[08:52.240 --> 08:53.280]  Yeah, a Philly cheese stakeout.
[08:55.500 --> 08:59.080]  I love this because I'm just fascinated to find out what you talk about.
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.280]  Uh, I'm going to put it on. I'm going to put it on the ideal list.
[09:01.400 --> 09:02.120]  Hold on. Yeah, yeah. Put it.
[09:02.200 --> 09:03.720]  Yeah, let's let's do it.
[09:03.800 --> 09:06.600]  You really find it hard to imagine what Nick and Eric would talk about?
[09:06.700 --> 09:07.680]  I feel like it's so easy.
[09:07.840 --> 09:11.760]  Yeah, that's I think more a reflection of you than them.
[09:12.340 --> 09:13.740]  Well, Gavin's not like a sports guy.
[09:13.900 --> 09:14.720]  That's what I'm saying.
[09:14.740 --> 09:16.420]  Like, I think he just doesn't get that.
[09:16.980 --> 09:17.140]  Yeah.
[09:18.140 --> 09:22.140]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever spoken to anyone about sport.
[09:22.800 --> 09:23.160]  Interesting.
[09:23.480 --> 09:24.220]  That's what I'm saying.
[09:24.220 --> 09:26.900]  I think it's a deeper well than you're realizing.
[09:27.320 --> 09:31.240]  I think it's going to be a fascinating window into the relationship of the two.
[09:31.340 --> 09:35.520]  Your general interest, Gavin, which would you say you'd be able to talk the longest about?
[09:36.000 --> 09:37.880]  Just like you're dropped in a scenario.
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.220]  What is the most ideal thing?
[09:40.520 --> 09:42.800]  You end up in a lunch with somebody that you don't really know.
[09:43.140 --> 09:46.000]  What subject could you go the longest on?
[09:46.380 --> 09:48.160]  Well, I don't even know if he's ever going to do that.
[09:49.220 --> 09:50.860]  He could talk about his RVB fandom.
[09:52.440 --> 09:55.420]  So are you saying what sport or what subject in general?
[09:55.580 --> 09:56.360]  What subjects?
[09:56.420 --> 09:58.280]  Because Nick and Eric have sports.
[09:58.340 --> 09:59.860]  That's like they could just go forever on that.
[09:59.940 --> 10:00.820]  That's easy radio.
[10:01.080 --> 10:01.640]  Yeah, radio.
[10:01.860 --> 10:06.680]  If you get I'm saying for you, what would be your equivalent of sports socially?
[10:07.280 --> 10:08.220]  But who am I talking to?
[10:08.760 --> 10:09.160]  Anybody.
[10:09.580 --> 10:10.720]  It doesn't really matter.
[10:11.900 --> 10:15.200]  Someone that like what is in the same way that you're like,
[10:15.240 --> 10:16.540]  I don't know what they'll talk about.
[10:16.580 --> 10:18.180]  And we're saying they talk sports.
[10:18.240 --> 10:19.280]  It's really easy to talk sports.
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.840]  What would be the subject that would be your sports?
[10:21.980 --> 10:22.820]  What is your sports?
[10:23.560 --> 10:24.160]  Movies, games.
[10:25.060 --> 10:25.700]  Movies, games.
[10:25.860 --> 10:25.980]  OK.
[10:26.280 --> 10:26.480]  Cameras.
[10:26.540 --> 10:28.100]  I would feel like you could talk about frame rate.
[10:29.000 --> 10:29.320]  Wow.
[10:29.860 --> 10:31.120]  Law of reciprocity.
[10:31.640 --> 10:33.220]  Who's going to talk to me about frame rate though?
[10:33.740 --> 10:35.260]  Some person that we're inventing.
[10:36.180 --> 10:36.500]  120.
[10:37.560 --> 10:38.280]  Oh, my God.
[10:38.480 --> 10:39.400]  59.9.
[10:39.920 --> 10:40.360]  Tell me.
[10:40.420 --> 10:40.860]  Teach me.
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.920]  Maybe this is what I'll talk to Nick about if we ever have lunch.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.140]  Oh, let's have lunch.
[10:45.380 --> 10:47.820]  That's got to be and we have to record that because that's your show, right?
[10:47.840 --> 10:49.260]  We have to figure out what your show is.
[10:49.280 --> 10:50.580]  You guys are going to have lunch.
[10:50.700 --> 10:53.580]  We have to be in a car outside watching with binoculars recording it.
[10:53.740 --> 11:00.500]  I think of all of the people on the show, it is easily Gavin and Nick are the one that I'm most.
[11:00.660 --> 11:00.860]  Yes.
[11:01.040 --> 11:01.680]  Interested in.
[11:01.760 --> 11:02.680]  A hundred percent.
[11:02.880 --> 11:04.080]  I'm not sure where that would go.
[11:04.160 --> 11:06.020]  It's the combination that's had the least time.
[11:06.340 --> 11:06.620]  Yes.
[11:06.900 --> 11:11.120]  Maybe this show is just every iteration of all of us eating lunch.
[11:11.280 --> 11:14.400]  And that's and then once we get through it, then the series is over.
[11:14.900 --> 11:18.860]  Eric, when you and I eat lunch together, I'm going to endeavor not to open my mouth to speak
[11:18.860 --> 11:19.920]  at the entire time.
[11:20.260 --> 11:22.240]  Why would we do?
[11:22.340 --> 11:23.300]  Why would you do that?
[11:23.300 --> 11:24.840]  Because I think you and I could pull it off.
[11:25.160 --> 11:28.060]  I think we could do it.
[11:28.400 --> 11:29.740]  This stakeout is exhausting.
[11:30.040 --> 11:32.960]  I do think stakeout, stakeout is a good idea where we eat.
[11:33.140 --> 11:33.340]  I do.
[11:33.480 --> 11:35.140]  Two other people eat chili cheese steaks.
[11:35.460 --> 11:35.960]  Cheese steak out.
[11:35.960 --> 11:37.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:38.020 --> 11:39.160]  This is a good idea.
[11:39.260 --> 11:39.960]  Great idea.
[11:40.120 --> 11:41.260]  Yeah, man.
[11:41.800 --> 11:43.520]  I got some other great ideas for you guys today, too.
[11:45.540 --> 11:48.640]  Well, Gavin's trying to mail us cum, so it's got to be better than that, right?
[11:48.860 --> 11:49.960]  Yeah, absolutely.
[11:50.300 --> 11:53.960]  Speaking of receiving things in the mail, we had a great loss that you guys don't know about.
[11:54.420 --> 11:57.060]  I lost something for the show for us that I bought.
[11:57.460 --> 12:02.820]  I was excited to share, you know, in a better way than the way in which I'm doing it now.
[12:03.180 --> 12:06.780]  But I'm thinking about content coming out in the future.
[12:06.980 --> 12:08.720]  You're going to get this.
[12:08.860 --> 12:10.420]  Trust me, trust me.
[12:10.460 --> 12:11.020]  No question.
[12:12.440 --> 12:14.740]  This is something I wanted to reveal in a better way.
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.060]  I can't question it.
[12:16.100 --> 12:17.320]  I don't know what the fuck you said.
[12:17.940 --> 12:19.460]  I said that I'm revealing it now.
[12:19.520 --> 12:23.400]  I wanted to reveal this in better terms than the terms that I am.
[12:24.420 --> 12:30.280]  But I bought something because we were coming up on when we would do another big movie battle.
[12:30.600 --> 12:34.960]  And to add to the excitement of the battle, I wanted to get trophies.
[12:35.040 --> 12:36.160]  So we'd have something on the line.
[12:36.540 --> 12:40.020]  So I've been looking at different things I could use as a trophy.
[12:40.020 --> 12:44.940]  And I ordered something that I thought would be the absolute best prize to receive.
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.080]  If you came in dead last.
[12:47.660 --> 12:51.360]  And that is... let me put a photo of it in our chat.
[12:52.400 --> 12:53.840]  Is it a vial of Gavin's cum?
[12:55.120 --> 12:55.920]  You know what?
[12:56.020 --> 12:59.080]  Surprisingly hard to find, considering it was mailed everywhere.
[12:59.640 --> 13:00.660]  I couldn't get it.
[13:01.080 --> 13:11.080]  So no, it is an even more rare item of a graded copy of The Big Bounce on VHS that is still sealed.
[13:11.860 --> 13:12.360]  What is that?
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.700]  What's The Big Bounce?
[13:14.940 --> 13:16.180]  That's the trophy.
[13:16.420 --> 13:24.300]  Yes, I thought nothing would better represent last place than a mid-2000s crime comedy
[13:24.920 --> 13:27.420]  on VHS that's sealed and graded.
[13:28.060 --> 13:33.380]  The bad news of why I'm unveiling this now is it was stolen from my doorstop.
[13:33.780 --> 13:37.620]  And I just cannot.
[13:37.840 --> 13:40.300]  I keep thinking about it ever since it happened.
[13:40.300 --> 13:45.460]  That somebody... somebody stole a package from my front door,
[13:45.860 --> 13:48.600]  assuming something of value would be in it.
[13:48.640 --> 13:55.660]  And to open it to discover The Big Bounce on VHS... graded.
[13:56.160 --> 13:59.460]  I really just want to know what's going on in their head.
[14:00.460 --> 14:03.700]  I wonder if they thought it would have value because it is graded.
[14:03.920 --> 14:06.240]  It costs $30 to buy that.
[14:06.520 --> 14:09.240]  I've never seen a graded thing be cheaper.
[14:10.300 --> 14:14.260]  So I was very excited to have this, but it's gone.
[14:14.520 --> 14:15.800]  Someone stole The Big Bounce.
[14:16.320 --> 14:17.100]  How do you know it's stolen?
[14:18.480 --> 14:19.560]  I don't know.
[14:19.960 --> 14:24.220]  You should check eBay Canada to see if that magically shows up in the next couple of days.
[14:24.520 --> 14:28.600]  I should, but I'm glad that you guys don't really know what The Big Bounce is.
[14:29.100 --> 14:32.260]  It's a movie I remember renting when it came out and not liking.
[14:32.720 --> 14:34.400]  And that's all I remember about it.
[14:34.620 --> 14:36.540]  This movie came out in 2004,
[14:36.760 --> 14:40.000]  and it looks like something I wouldn't like then, nor would I like it now.
[14:40.640 --> 14:43.800]  You don't like all the Hawaiian shirts we got going on on this front box?
[14:44.100 --> 14:46.380]  It is. It is really something, man.
[14:46.840 --> 14:46.980]  Yeah.
[14:47.740 --> 14:53.360]  Owen Wilson, Morgan Freeman, Gary Sinise, Sarah Foster.
[14:54.040 --> 14:54.880]  Hang on. Not done.
[14:55.340 --> 14:57.800]  Willie Nelson, Vinnie Jones.
[14:58.740 --> 14:59.740]  Oh, Vinnie Jones!
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.540]  Oh, we gotta see it now!
[15:02.020 --> 15:06.100]  I feel like this was Willie Nelson's film era between The Big Bounce and The Dukes of Hazard.
[15:06.280 --> 15:07.020]  Like, I think he really...
[15:07.940 --> 15:10.200]  2004 was the year he took a swing at it.
[15:10.300 --> 15:13.480]  Total runtime, 88 minutes.
[15:13.480 --> 15:14.320]  I want to watch it!
[15:14.320 --> 15:14.800]  Oh, that's a bad movie.
[15:15.040 --> 15:17.100]  Oh, that is a bad sign.
[15:17.600 --> 15:19.580]  88 minutes? That's my kind of movie.
[15:19.860 --> 15:22.680]  Yeah, I mean, that's cool that you know it's a bad movie, though.
[15:22.940 --> 15:23.060]  Wow.
[15:23.600 --> 15:26.520]  Yeah, 85 minutes is the perfect movie length.
[15:27.080 --> 15:27.780]  It's so close.
[15:28.400 --> 15:30.300]  I wonder what percentage of our audience has seen this.
[15:30.900 --> 15:31.880]  Less than 1%?
[15:32.100 --> 15:33.240]  Let us know in the comments.
[15:33.520 --> 15:35.680]  We'll do a poll or something, but let us know in the comments.
[15:35.860 --> 15:36.940]  Budget, 50 million.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.160]  Box office, 6.8.
[15:38.380 --> 15:38.660]  Ouch.
[15:38.660 --> 15:41.640]  Oh my god, there's huge names in that.
[15:41.820 --> 15:42.240]  That, yeah.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.660]  It's an Elmer Leonard adaption.
[15:43.960 --> 15:47.480]  I don't know if I've ever even seen, like, a trailer for this.
[15:47.580 --> 15:49.460]  Nothing about this is familiar to me.
[15:50.140 --> 15:53.060]  Vinny Jones probably made more money that week playing football.
[15:56.640 --> 16:00.060]  You'd think the number one review is The Big Snooze is the title of it.
[16:03.240 --> 16:04.140]  It's just, yeah.
[16:05.140 --> 16:07.880]  I'm on the hunt again, essentially, is the moral of the story.
[16:07.880 --> 16:09.920]  I think it's hilarious that somebody stole this.
[16:10.460 --> 16:12.140]  And I would have loved to have seen the reaction.
[16:12.260 --> 16:15.720]  Now I'm back looking to find the last place trophy.
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.380]  I got a few other things lined up for it that I'll reveal when we get closer.
[16:21.100 --> 16:22.060]  But last place.
[16:22.140 --> 16:27.020]  If anyone finds anything really dumb that is movie memorabilia, I guess put it in the comments.
[16:27.140 --> 16:27.480]  Let me know.
[16:28.120 --> 16:29.020]  I'd love to see it.
[16:29.660 --> 16:31.000]  Not a lot of trivia for this film either.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.600]  Jeremy Renner was offered a role in this film but turned it down due to SWAT,
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.280]  which is the only other Jeremy Renner movie I can think of from that time.
[16:39.440 --> 16:41.780]  Stop giving me facts about The Big Bounce.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.100]  There's not a lot of facts to give about The Big Bounce.
[16:44.320 --> 16:46.880]  I don't know what The Big Bounce is.
[16:47.100 --> 16:47.840]  You're telling me...
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.060]  The original novel, Eric, is set in Winswet, Michigan.
[16:51.620 --> 16:58.620]  For this abeditation, George Armitage shifted the location to the more amenable Hawaii.
[16:58.740 --> 17:00.940]  Why are we still talking about this?
[17:01.560 --> 17:01.940]  What?
[17:02.020 --> 17:05.060]  I don't want to talk about The Big Bounce anymore.
[17:05.060 --> 17:06.500]  I hate The Big Bounce.
[17:08.520 --> 17:11.200]  Do you have a S-T-E-A-K in it?
[17:11.540 --> 17:11.820]  Yeah.
[17:12.340 --> 17:14.480]  Geoff, do one of your new content ideas involve bouncing?
[17:14.960 --> 17:15.920]  It could.
[17:16.320 --> 17:18.040]  I stumbled on some.
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.260]  I was in the lab a little bit this weekend and I think I backed my way into inventing
[17:24.260 --> 17:29.460]  an entire new workout genre that I am very excited to share with y'all.
[17:29.980 --> 17:34.100]  I was at Costco, as I am, once a week, every week of my life.
[17:34.100 --> 17:36.320]  It's one of my favorite places.
[17:36.500 --> 17:38.200]  But I don't like that other people go to Costco.
[17:38.480 --> 17:39.940]  I don't like other people in general.
[17:40.440 --> 17:43.300]  Other people at Costco are extra bad for some reason.
[17:43.460 --> 17:45.480]  It's like the combination of the two.
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.720]  It just makes like...
[17:46.720 --> 17:49.360]  It's like chocolate and peanut butter into dickheads, right?
[17:50.440 --> 17:55.700]  So while I was leaving Costco with a giant shopping cart full of shit and
[17:56.480 --> 17:57.200]  cars are...
[17:57.200 --> 17:58.600]  There was a line of cars behind me.
[17:58.660 --> 17:59.660]  It's the thing that they always do.
[17:59.700 --> 18:01.220]  I don't know if you've been to the Costcos in Austin.
[18:01.460 --> 18:02.340]  I'm sure it's the same everywhere.
[18:02.340 --> 18:05.820]  But a parking place, I would pay for one at the Costco in Austin.
[18:06.280 --> 18:10.500]  I have to park like three stores over sometimes to go to the Costco that we go to
[18:10.500 --> 18:12.580]  because it's so fucking crowded all the time.
[18:13.540 --> 18:15.640]  And while I was walking out, I was pushing my cart.
[18:15.720 --> 18:16.260]  It was pretty heavy.
[18:16.300 --> 18:17.540]  I was thinking, this is kind of a workout.
[18:17.680 --> 18:19.920]  And I was thinking about how much I fucking hate working out.
[18:19.980 --> 18:22.220]  And I have to trick myself into working out.
[18:22.340 --> 18:25.820]  Riding bikes is how I trick myself into working out these days, right?
[18:26.340 --> 18:28.720]  But that doesn't give me any kind of like upper body strength.
[18:28.720 --> 18:31.820]  And I was like, it's almost like a workout pushing this cart if I pushed it long enough.
[18:31.820 --> 18:36.780]  And then I thought, this asshole behind me is just waiting for me to get to my car
[18:36.780 --> 18:39.680]  so that I can load it up and back out and leave.
[18:39.780 --> 18:41.220]  And then he can take my parking space.
[18:41.340 --> 18:44.280]  If I just keep walking, how long is this guy going to follow me?
[18:44.540 --> 18:46.480]  I invented dickhead calisthenics.
[18:46.740 --> 18:47.480]  Here's what we do.
[18:47.580 --> 18:51.520]  We go to Costco and Walmart parking lots on Saturdays or the mall where it's very crowded.
[18:51.760 --> 18:52.860]  We take a shopping cart.
[18:52.940 --> 18:55.760]  We fill it up with heavy, non-perishable items.
[18:55.840 --> 18:57.280]  Even bring weights from home if you want to.
[18:57.460 --> 19:01.360]  And then you just push a shopping cart up and down rows for 20 minutes straight.
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.060]  People queue up behind you thinking that you're going to a parking space, but you're not.
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.140]  You're just getting a workout.
[19:06.460 --> 19:11.700]  You're making them miserable, getting in shape and making yourself happy all at the same time.
[19:11.880 --> 19:15.000]  This is how I can trick myself into working out.
[19:15.080 --> 19:17.500]  And I bet there's a lot of other dickheads out there in the world
[19:17.500 --> 19:20.660]  that would work out if they thought it was inconveniencing someone else.
[19:21.440 --> 19:24.620]  Wait, so somebody is following you looking for a space?
[19:25.060 --> 19:27.380]  Yeah, like when you're walking through the parking lot and you're pushing your cart
[19:27.380 --> 19:29.780]  and there's a car behind you and they think that you're going to go and unload.
[19:29.780 --> 19:32.520]  So they follow behind you so that when you unload your car and back out,
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.160]  they can swoop in and take the space.
[19:34.240 --> 19:35.720]  But you just never do that.
[19:35.780 --> 19:37.200]  You just keep going up and down the rows.
[19:37.360 --> 19:39.900]  And if and they're like, oh, this guy must not know where his car is.
[19:39.940 --> 19:41.300]  He must have got lost. Sucks to be him.
[19:41.420 --> 19:42.500]  But they're still following you.
[19:42.660 --> 19:43.340]  They're still following you.
[19:43.360 --> 19:45.960]  You're going to waste five or six minutes of their time before they realize
[19:45.960 --> 19:47.680]  you're never going to find your car.
[19:48.060 --> 19:51.020]  And then the next car will come up immediately and be like, oh, I just saw a guy.
[19:51.280 --> 19:53.920]  He's got he's at the end of the parking lot with a full shopping cart.
[19:54.080 --> 19:55.240]  I'm about to get his space.
[19:55.300 --> 19:58.480]  But you're not because I'm going all the way back to the front of the parking lot
[19:58.480 --> 20:00.740]  and I'm going all the way back to the end of the parking lot again.
[20:00.960 --> 20:03.380]  And after, I don't know, enough reps, I will have gotten a workout.
[20:04.360 --> 20:08.440]  My my misery index will be through the roof because I've made you people unhappy
[20:08.440 --> 20:13.360]  and I can go home sated that I've worked out my mind, my soul and my body.
[20:13.580 --> 20:14.680]  Now, I love this idea.
[20:14.780 --> 20:15.800]  I think this is fantastic.
[20:16.240 --> 20:21.880]  My only thing and I would love to know if it's just a it could be a Canadian thing.
[20:21.900 --> 20:23.240]  It could be a community.
[20:23.240 --> 20:24.700]  I live in thing for size.
[20:25.360 --> 20:27.220]  This has never been a thing that has occurred
[20:27.220 --> 20:30.160]  or has been a thing that I've even considered doing.
[20:30.540 --> 20:33.700]  This happens every parking lot in America every day.
[20:33.860 --> 20:38.760]  Like you you when you can't find a space, you just keep going until you find one.
[20:39.180 --> 20:39.280]  Yeah.
[20:39.280 --> 20:42.120]  And you'll see a car backing out and, you know, be like, oh, great.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.460]  This will be my space.
[20:43.680 --> 20:46.600]  And then sometimes there may be conflict if someone tries to steal that.
[20:46.660 --> 20:47.780]  If another vehicle shows up.
[20:47.840 --> 20:53.620]  But just following someone on foot seems like such a unnecessary move because
[20:54.180 --> 20:56.600]  like, why are you being married to this one person?
[20:56.600 --> 20:57.740]  You're in a store.
[20:58.100 --> 21:00.400]  Because this person is a guaranteed parking spot.
[21:00.500 --> 21:02.080]  They're driving towards their car.
[21:02.140 --> 21:03.380]  They're walking towards their car.
[21:03.780 --> 21:05.220]  They've already completed their groceries.
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.240]  Their shopping cart is full.
[21:06.360 --> 21:10.080]  You know, if you stay behind this person and they're on an aisle, you know, they're headed
[21:10.080 --> 21:12.020]  to the somewhere on that aisle.
[21:12.420 --> 21:14.380]  I'm surprised you've never seen this.
[21:14.420 --> 21:16.060]  This happens to me every day of my life.
[21:16.180 --> 21:18.340]  It's like explaining clouds.
[21:18.840 --> 21:20.340]  Yeah, that's I think is interesting.
[21:20.560 --> 21:22.140]  I don't know.
[21:22.180 --> 21:24.680]  As I said, it'd be interesting to know if it's cultural.
[21:24.680 --> 21:26.620]  I'd like to hear from the other three.
[21:26.780 --> 21:29.180]  Are you guys understanding what I'm saying?
[21:29.360 --> 21:34.100]  Or do you align with Andrew's never having seen somebody follow a person in a parking
[21:34.100 --> 21:34.780]  lot for a space?
[21:34.880 --> 21:37.440]  And just to be clear, I completely get where you're coming from.
[21:37.480 --> 21:40.420]  It's just not something that I have seen or would consider as a driver.
[21:40.740 --> 21:42.380]  Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about, Geoff.
[21:42.500 --> 21:42.900]  Exactly.
[21:43.260 --> 21:49.020]  I think it could be a size of my community thing because the Costco is annoying to get
[21:49.020 --> 21:49.880]  a space at.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.820]  But if you just keep driving, you will find one within five minutes in that parking lot.
[21:53.820 --> 21:55.780]  Gavin, do you understand this also?
[21:56.400 --> 21:56.640]  Yeah.
[21:57.060 --> 21:58.200]  OK, because you don't drive.
[21:58.300 --> 21:59.500]  So I was just curious.
[21:59.600 --> 22:00.180]  I've been a passenger.
[22:00.360 --> 22:00.920]  I've been in a car.
[22:03.820 --> 22:06.960]  I just feel like most places I go, though, you just park at the back.
[22:07.140 --> 22:09.000]  Just like go just drive far away.
[22:09.120 --> 22:09.640]  That's what I do.
[22:09.880 --> 22:11.140]  Go to Costco and park at the back.
[22:11.200 --> 22:11.800]  There is no back.
[22:11.860 --> 22:12.260]  It's full.
[22:12.760 --> 22:13.780]  Yeah, I've only been once.
[22:14.220 --> 22:14.400]  Yeah.
[22:14.700 --> 22:14.960]  What?
[22:15.640 --> 22:17.020]  You've only been to Costco once?
[22:17.360 --> 22:17.540]  Yeah.
[22:18.200 --> 22:18.460]  What?
[22:18.560 --> 22:18.820]  Really?
[22:18.960 --> 22:19.660]  That's enough for him.
[22:19.740 --> 22:20.620]  I mean, he doesn't drive.
[22:20.740 --> 22:21.460]  Want to go get lunch?
[22:21.460 --> 22:24.840]  You want to go get lunch?
[22:25.320 --> 22:25.600]  Yes.
[22:25.920 --> 22:27.780]  The staycat will be on the move because they couldn't park.
[22:27.900 --> 22:29.980]  Gavin and Nick should have to go get lunch at a Costco.
[22:30.220 --> 22:33.400]  Because here's like what Gavin's saying is right.
[22:33.580 --> 22:33.780]  Yeah.
[22:33.940 --> 22:36.580]  Just go park in the back away from everything, whatever.
[22:37.500 --> 22:39.720]  But that doesn't stop everyone else.
[22:40.100 --> 22:43.420]  And I think that's I think those are the comments that we'll get on something like this, where it's
[22:43.420 --> 22:44.380]  like, I just park in the back.
[22:44.420 --> 22:46.080]  It's like, right, then this doesn't apply to you.
[22:46.560 --> 22:51.080]  This applies to every other person trying to park in the front, like the closest parking spot.
[22:51.080 --> 22:53.640]  But there are no spots in the back at Costco.
[22:53.760 --> 22:55.720]  I'm telling you, I was there Sunday.
[22:56.040 --> 22:58.860]  We drove around for 12 minutes.
[22:59.600 --> 23:02.680]  Like I had to park at a Marshalls.
[23:02.820 --> 23:07.560]  It was Costco, Whole Foods, Marshalls.
[23:07.620 --> 23:13.680]  I had to park at the Marshalls and walk through the Marshalls and the Whole Foods and into the
[23:13.680 --> 23:15.240]  Costco parking lot to get a space.
[23:15.460 --> 23:17.160]  I would have happily parked in the back.
[23:17.240 --> 23:18.000]  I would have happily...
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.800]  Dude, at the Costco where I go to, people park on the fucking grass.
[23:20.800 --> 23:22.820]  Next to trees to go there.
[23:22.880 --> 23:25.380]  There are these spaces you're talking about don't exist.
[23:25.520 --> 23:26.400]  That's so interesting.
[23:26.500 --> 23:27.400]  That's the whole point of this.
[23:27.580 --> 23:31.960]  I have been to like a Best Buy car parks before, though, with Americans, and they'll just do
[23:32.480 --> 23:37.560]  four or five loops of the front trying to get a real close spot and just be driving past
[23:38.380 --> 23:41.320]  150 empty spots just slightly further away.
[23:41.380 --> 23:43.220]  Just just throw the car somewhere.
[23:43.640 --> 23:44.580]  I'm right there with you, dude.
[23:44.640 --> 23:45.860]  Get a little bit of exercise.
[23:45.960 --> 23:46.420]  Go walk.
[23:46.460 --> 23:47.200]  I like to walk.
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.620]  That's why I want to invent this game where the job, the whole point of the job is to walk
[23:51.620 --> 23:53.440]  up and down the aisles.
[23:53.560 --> 23:58.060]  Yeah, I think a lot of Americans on the daily will park as though it's raining, even when it's not.
[23:58.120 --> 23:58.340]  Yes.
[23:59.180 --> 24:03.000]  Additionally, this is just the first this is just the first exercise I've come up with.
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.240]  I think that this is a this is kind of a thought starter.
[24:06.560 --> 24:07.540]  This is kind of a hey, do it.
[24:07.560 --> 24:08.220]  Try it on for size.
[24:08.280 --> 24:08.840]  See who it is.
[24:09.140 --> 24:09.540]  Oh, cool.
[24:09.560 --> 24:10.160]  I got a workout.
[24:10.280 --> 24:11.660]  I got to be a little bit of a dickhead.
[24:11.700 --> 24:13.060]  It served both purposes.
[24:13.520 --> 24:17.040]  How else can I apply this ideology to working out?
[24:17.040 --> 24:21.400]  And find other ways that you can be a dickhead to other people while getting a workout yourself?
[24:21.480 --> 24:22.140]  I'd love to hear it.
[24:23.320 --> 24:29.260]  In a multi-story building, you watch someone go into a lift and then you run up the stairs and
[24:29.260 --> 24:31.560]  you hit the button on every floor from the outside.
[24:32.260 --> 24:32.660]  Wow.
[24:32.960 --> 24:36.280]  Until you're at the top and you really get your cardio in and you'll piss off.
[24:36.300 --> 24:37.340]  I love that.
[24:37.880 --> 24:40.460]  Wow, Gavin, that is great.
[24:40.640 --> 24:42.820]  That's that's exactly what we're talking about.
[24:42.900 --> 24:44.980]  That is dickhead calisthenics to a tee, Gavin.
[24:45.000 --> 24:45.660]  That is brilliant.
[24:46.380 --> 24:47.500]  Now, let's block two.
[24:49.400 --> 24:52.600]  When was the last time you thought you needed to go to a doctor,
[24:52.800 --> 24:55.980]  but you pushed it off for any of a myriad of reasons?
[24:55.980 --> 24:57.220]  You're very busy.
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.840]  It'll sort itself out on its own.
[25:00.040 --> 25:01.440]  I don't actually need the help.
[25:01.660 --> 25:03.020]  I don't even know who my doctor is.
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.340]  It's been so long since I've been to a doctor or any of a million other reasons.
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.740]  I think we've all been there.
[25:08.120 --> 25:10.840]  Booking a doctor appointment can just feel so daunting.
[25:10.860 --> 25:13.860]  But thanks to ZocDoc, there's no reason to delay.
[25:13.860 --> 25:19.540]  Don't make excuses because they make it so easy to find and book a doctor who is right for you.
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.160]  Like, have you ever woken up with a swollen, itchy eye?
[25:22.260 --> 25:22.920]  I'm 49.
[25:23.380 --> 25:25.980]  Half of my body itches at all times now.
[25:26.340 --> 25:28.600]  A persistent cold that won't go away.
[25:28.960 --> 25:31.180]  I think my wife has had a cold for six months.
[25:31.560 --> 25:33.260]  Don't even get me started on rashes.
[25:33.680 --> 25:34.680]  It's a family podcast.
[25:35.180 --> 25:41.320]  Instead of just itching your day away, get help and care you really need with ZocDoc.
[25:41.320 --> 25:47.560]  It is a free app and website where you can search and compare high-quality in-network doctors and
[25:47.560 --> 25:50.280]  click to instantly book an appointment.

[25:56.340 --> 26:00.600]  maybe who are a good fit for your weird, specific medical need,
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.160]  and most importantly, you can sort by rating.
[26:03.480 --> 26:06.160]  So you know you're getting the best doctor out there.
[26:06.400 --> 26:10.460]  Once you find that doctor, see their actual appointment openings
[26:10.460 --> 26:15.100]  and choose a time slot that works for you, then instantly book your visit.
[26:15.480 --> 26:17.920]  Appointments made through ZocDoc also happen fast,
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.020]  typically within just 24 to 72 hours of booking.
[26:21.180 --> 26:23.740]  And if you have tried to make an appointment with a doctor out there recently,
[26:23.900 --> 26:25.720]  you know that is not an easy thing to do.
[26:26.120 --> 26:28.140]  There are waiting lists.
[26:28.740 --> 26:33.460]  I know the next time there's an itch that I can't scratch away, I'll be ZocDoc-ing immediately.
[26:33.940 --> 26:39.520]  So stop putting off those doctor appointments and go to ZocDoc.com slash regulation.
[26:39.520 --> 26:42.900]  That was easy to say, and I nailed it on the first try.
[26:43.660 --> 26:47.320]  And find and instantly book a top-rated doctor today.
[26:47.480 --> 26:51.960]  That is Z-O-C-D-O-C dot com slash regulation.
[26:52.900 --> 26:55.000]  ZocDoc.com slash regulation.
[26:57.080 --> 26:58.800]  All right, it's Q&A time.
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.960]  One Q from me to you.
[27:01.120 --> 27:04.000]  Do you end up getting takeout more than you would like?
[27:04.080 --> 27:05.780]  I know personally, I do.
[27:05.780 --> 27:09.580]  My wife and I actually have sworn off takeout for the next 60 days.
[27:09.680 --> 27:10.380]  We're not doing it.
[27:10.540 --> 27:14.860]  It feels like a convenience thing, but then when you look at the bill at the end of the day,
[27:14.940 --> 27:16.880]  and let's be honest, the food shows up.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.660]  It's like they put it in the dryer on tumble before it gets to you.
[27:19.720 --> 27:24.760]  The pizza is on every inward-facing wall of the box all at once somehow.
[27:25.080 --> 27:27.820]  There's pepperoni under the bottom of the pizza.
[27:27.880 --> 27:28.520]  How did it get there?
[27:28.900 --> 27:30.960]  But thank God for Factor.
[27:31.520 --> 27:35.760]  Chef-made gourmet meals that make eating well easy,
[27:35.920 --> 27:40.500]  and they're ready to heat and eat in two minutes so you don't have to cook.
[27:40.700 --> 27:41.840]  It is the end of the day.
[27:41.940 --> 27:42.840]  You are exhausted.
[27:43.020 --> 27:45.300]  You've been dealing with clients all day.
[27:45.500 --> 27:47.640]  You've been dealing with co-workers all day.
[27:47.740 --> 27:51.080]  You've probably been dealing with your children all day.
[27:51.180 --> 27:55.740]  And the last thing on earth you want to do is spend 45 minutes to two hours
[27:55.740 --> 27:59.500]  cooking a meal that nobody's going to appreciate anyway.
[27:59.500 --> 28:04.100]  Why not just go the delicious, easy, fast, fun route?
[28:04.440 --> 28:08.120]  Factor, America's number one ready-to-eat meal delivery service.
[28:08.460 --> 28:10.520]  They arrive fresh and fully prepared.
[28:10.720 --> 28:13.940]  Perfect for any busy lifestyle like the one I just described.
[28:14.160 --> 28:16.720]  That's your lifestyle, and I'm describing it to you.
[28:16.860 --> 28:20.980]  With 40 options across eight dietary preferences each week,
[28:21.260 --> 28:23.940]  it is so easy to pick meals that are tailored for your goals.
[28:24.040 --> 28:27.500]  My particular goals are to eat delicious food lately,
[28:27.500 --> 28:30.740]  which is why I'm all about Indian-style butter chicken.
[28:31.140 --> 28:34.260]  I am all about herb ricotta and beef ragu.
[28:34.400 --> 28:37.240]  I like a garlic cream pork chop.
[28:37.640 --> 28:39.140]  Or how about green goddess chicken?
[28:39.400 --> 28:43.440]  I swear to God, green goddess dressing didn't exist for the first half of my lifetime.
[28:43.680 --> 28:45.180]  And then suddenly it's everywhere.
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.240]  You can't get enough of it.
[28:46.260 --> 28:48.400]  It's like avocado toast and green goddess dressing.
[28:48.580 --> 28:51.980]  Don't miss out on the green goddess chicken from Factor.
[28:51.980 --> 28:53.380]  So eat smart with Factor.

[29:14.180 --> 29:16.820]  When you go back home, Gavin,
[29:17.060 --> 29:21.820]  is there an adjustment for how to deal with drivers as a pedestrian for you?
[29:21.980 --> 29:29.780]  Like, is the culture around navigating on foot in a vehicle or in an area with vehicles different?
[29:30.380 --> 29:32.640]  Because I find that jarring whenever I was in Austin.
[29:33.200 --> 29:34.080]  How is it jarring for you?
[29:34.600 --> 29:37.500]  Like nobody, nobody waits for you to cross.
[29:37.740 --> 29:40.820]  You have to declare that as the walker.
[29:41.020 --> 29:43.100]  Are you talking about just on a crossing or just anywhere?
[29:43.560 --> 29:45.680]  Just on a crossing generally, I'd say.
[29:46.300 --> 29:52.860]  Here, it is a thing where if you're standing to cross, a car will stop almost immediately.
[29:53.180 --> 29:56.080]  Where in Austin, it felt like I had to declare that I was crossing.
[29:56.580 --> 29:58.440]  Well, the light usually tells you.
[29:58.920 --> 30:01.220]  In an environment without a light, I guess. Jesus Christ.
[30:01.660 --> 30:06.540]  Okay. Well, yeah, in England, there's the zebra crossings, which they have to stop.
[30:07.100 --> 30:07.600]  Oh, okay.
[30:08.020 --> 30:11.180]  So there's certain crossings where you could just walk across immediately.
[30:11.580 --> 30:12.740]  But it depends on where you are.
[30:12.740 --> 30:16.740]  I was just trying to like equate to Geoff's Costco thing of like, once again,
[30:17.220 --> 30:23.360]  I don't know if it is a different culture or if it is just a I live in a smaller population area.
[30:23.400 --> 30:24.620]  So it's just different.
[30:24.880 --> 30:27.920]  I think you live in a small town that doesn't have a lot of traffic, probably.
[30:28.160 --> 30:30.560]  But Austin's the 11th largest city in America.
[30:30.940 --> 30:33.500]  Yeah, it would definitely be different.
[30:33.560 --> 30:35.480]  But it's also, I mean, there's layers of culture.
[30:36.140 --> 30:37.880]  Costco, just a general nightmare.
[30:38.440 --> 30:43.420]  I wonder what the worst Costco is, like as far as what country's Costco is the most annoying.
[30:44.660 --> 30:46.200]  Is there a global brand?
[30:46.260 --> 30:47.000]  I would assume, right?
[30:47.040 --> 30:49.180]  There's Costco's everywhere around the world.
[30:49.320 --> 30:49.840]  There are there.
[30:49.980 --> 30:51.460]  I know they're in Japan, at least.
[30:51.780 --> 30:53.360]  I bet you Costco Japan is great.
[30:53.820 --> 30:54.540]  Yeah, I've heard.
[30:54.680 --> 30:56.780]  I've heard Costco Japan's pretty cool.
[30:56.880 --> 31:00.560]  And if you have like your Costco membership from the US, it gets you in there also.
[31:00.740 --> 31:00.940]  Yeah.
[31:00.980 --> 31:03.640]  And they have like fresh sushi that they make in-house and stuff.
[31:03.700 --> 31:04.360]  That's supposed to be really good.
[31:04.360 --> 31:10.900]  Uh, Austin is the 11th largest city, according to this list.
[31:11.560 --> 31:12.960]  12th is Jacksonville?
[31:13.700 --> 31:17.080]  Yeah, it's like metropolitan area or however they measure cities.
[31:17.280 --> 31:20.280]  I just wouldn't, I would, if you would have asked me, where does Jacksonville rank?
[31:20.380 --> 31:21.180]  I would have been like 55.
[31:21.720 --> 31:23.200]  Like, yeah, that's crazy.
[31:23.340 --> 31:26.080]  I lived in Jacksonville for three and a half years and I wouldn't rank it in the top 50.
[31:26.520 --> 31:27.980]  Wild, wild.
[31:27.980 --> 31:30.140]  There should be an Olympic of Costco guys.
[31:31.320 --> 31:34.800]  Every country's Costco guys going head to head.
[31:35.380 --> 31:37.440]  Because we only have the US Costco guys currently.
[31:37.760 --> 31:41.520]  I want to see what Japan's Costco guys look like.
[31:41.680 --> 31:42.760]  Who's Costco guys?
[31:43.080 --> 31:44.980]  He's talking about the Rizzler and all those dudes.
[31:45.520 --> 31:45.800]  Yeah.
[31:48.900 --> 31:51.120]  Why does Eric sound like he's in a small bag?
[31:51.300 --> 31:52.300]  He said so far away, Eric.
[31:52.420 --> 31:54.660]  But I love it because I know how much you love the Rizzler.
[31:54.820 --> 31:57.480]  It's like you got so excited your whole equipment broke when you tried to unmute.
[31:57.900 --> 31:59.300]  Guys, guys, guys.
[31:59.300 --> 32:01.720]  Sorry, I got I started just slamming shit around.
[32:01.820 --> 32:03.440]  I heard I heard we were talking about the Rizzler.
[32:03.900 --> 32:07.520]  I think the Rizzler is going to have the longest career of those crew by far.
[32:07.760 --> 32:08.700]  I'm a big Rizzler guy.
[32:09.140 --> 32:10.140]  Well, he's got the Rizz.
[32:10.600 --> 32:15.800]  He's got the Rizz and his gimmick is just him being him.
[32:16.180 --> 32:20.980]  Where I feel like the Costco guys are reliant on the boom and the doom.
[32:21.180 --> 32:24.680]  Yeah, it's it's much like how Tobuscus had epic win fail.
[32:25.160 --> 32:28.320]  Boom or doom will eventually run its course, I imagine.
[32:29.300 --> 32:30.500]  Yeah, but not the Rizzler.
[32:31.000 --> 32:31.580]  Rizzler is forever.
[32:33.260 --> 32:39.580]  Speaking of forever, a long time ago, you and I got you and I, you guys and I.
[32:39.740 --> 32:39.880]  What?
[32:40.020 --> 32:42.280]  A long time ago, we landed on an idea.
[32:42.660 --> 32:44.200]  This is during Face Days.
[32:44.580 --> 32:44.780]  OK.
[32:45.060 --> 32:52.020]  We landed on an idea that our company, our brand should be protected by a superhero or a mascot.
[32:52.220 --> 32:52.360]  Yes.
[32:53.160 --> 32:55.500]  We began a global search.
[32:55.500 --> 33:00.100]  We eventually landed on the Smashing Sportsman, who I think was a perfect choice.
[33:00.220 --> 33:04.340]  Was a journalist who developed arthritis and got angry about it, right?
[33:04.860 --> 33:05.020]  Yep.
[33:07.540 --> 33:08.580]  We attempted.
[33:09.060 --> 33:13.820]  Boy, were we surprised and happy to find out that the Smashing Sportsman
[33:13.820 --> 33:15.300]  was a property of Warner Brothers.
[33:15.880 --> 33:18.300]  And so we immediately thought this is great.
[33:18.360 --> 33:22.240]  Maybe we can acquire the licensing from the Smashing Sportsman, who's not being used.
[33:22.400 --> 33:24.540]  Or do like a collaboration of some kind.
[33:24.540 --> 33:25.600]  Or do a collaboration.
[33:26.300 --> 33:28.100]  Our efforts fell on deaf ears.
[33:28.400 --> 33:29.140]  I don't think we were.
[33:29.440 --> 33:29.700]  Shockingly.
[33:29.980 --> 33:31.960]  Yeah, I don't think we were high on the priority list.
[33:32.060 --> 33:35.500]  I don't begrudge Warner Brothers for that at all.
[33:35.560 --> 33:36.240]  No, that's fair.
[33:36.420 --> 33:39.580]  But I would consider that to have been a dead end.
[33:39.720 --> 33:40.840]  The Smashing Sportsman, right?
[33:40.880 --> 33:41.800]  I absolutely agree.
[33:42.180 --> 33:44.020]  We are now fans of the Smashing Sportsman.
[33:44.120 --> 33:44.200]  Yes.
[33:44.240 --> 33:46.480]  Maybe the only people alive who are familiar with him.
[33:47.200 --> 33:51.340]  I was doing a podcast for So Alright yesterday.
[33:51.340 --> 33:54.880]  And I was talking about Woodsy the Owl.
[33:55.100 --> 33:58.660]  I was just at Disneyland and they had a Woodsy the Owl and a Smokey the Bear t-shirt.
[33:58.760 --> 33:59.820]  So I thought that that was weird at Disney.
[33:59.940 --> 34:03.060]  And I bought one because it's all about just how I like Woodsy the Owl and
[34:03.720 --> 34:05.580]  how it endeared itself to me as a child.
[34:05.660 --> 34:10.140]  But when I was learning about Woodsy the Owl, it mentioned that he and Smokey,
[34:10.440 --> 34:16.940]  along with Johnny Horizon, were the Department of Agriculture's
[34:18.020 --> 34:20.700]  forestry department mascots back in the day.
[34:20.700 --> 34:21.620]  I thought, Johnny Horizon?
[34:21.780 --> 34:24.040]  I've never heard of Johnny Horizon.
[34:24.320 --> 34:25.920]  Let me look that name up.
[34:26.400 --> 34:27.500]  Here's Johnny Horizon.
[34:28.180 --> 34:32.160]  Johnny Horizon was a mascot used by the Bureau of Land Management in the United States in the
[34:32.160 --> 34:35.020]  1970s, primarily for its anti-litter campaign.
[34:35.500 --> 34:36.660]  Yeah, this land is your land.
[34:36.800 --> 34:42.220]  When they had the bicentennial, they had a huge program led by Johnny Horizon,
[34:42.400 --> 34:46.660]  which was like, let's get 200 million Americans to clean up America for our 200th year,
[34:46.720 --> 34:47.260]  our bicentennial.
[34:47.360 --> 34:47.840]  Here it is right now.
[34:47.980 --> 34:49.380]  It was a huge success.
[34:49.580 --> 34:50.400]  It was so successful.
[34:50.400 --> 34:57.840]  They were in the process of creating Johnny Horizon National Park grounds around the country
[34:57.840 --> 34:59.200]  that you could go and stay at.
[34:59.280 --> 35:00.660]  It was like KOA campgrounds.
[35:00.880 --> 35:05.020]  Johnny Horizon was instantly bigger than Woodsy Owl and Smokey the Bear.
[35:05.720 --> 35:08.920]  However, he became very expensive very quickly.
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.180]  And the people that created Johnny Horizon after like two years after the successful
[35:13.180 --> 35:17.320]  campaign in 74 and 75 for the bicentennial, they went to the Department of Agriculture
[35:17.320 --> 35:19.220]  and said, we need to double the budget on Johnny Horizon.
[35:19.400 --> 35:20.200]  We want more of this.
[35:20.200 --> 35:22.320]  The Department of Agriculture said, fuck you.
[35:22.660 --> 35:23.840]  We don't need this.
[35:23.980 --> 35:25.840]  We've got a bear and an owl.
[35:26.020 --> 35:26.460]  We don't need it.
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.840]  We don't need the Marlboro Man without a cigarette.
[35:29.440 --> 35:30.400]  We've got our own shit.
[35:30.700 --> 35:39.300]  So in 1982, they relinquished their trademark on Johnny Horizon.
[35:39.740 --> 35:41.860]  I think he's an independent player.
[35:42.660 --> 35:42.760]  Really?
[35:43.200 --> 35:48.660]  He was huge in the mid-70s, led a nationwide anti-littering campaign.
[35:48.660 --> 35:53.880]  His only problem was he teamed up with Burl Ives when Burl Ives was like a big deal.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.660]  Like his only problem was that he cost too much money to produce.
[35:56.880 --> 36:02.560]  And so they cut and ran and they relinquished their ownership of him.
[36:02.900 --> 36:05.500]  He isn't trademarked or owned by anybody.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.060]  Are you thinking, grab him for the tricentennial?
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.160]  I think Johnny Horizon could be, he seems like a regulation kind of guy.
[36:13.380 --> 36:14.680]  He wears a cowboy hat.
[36:14.920 --> 36:16.560]  He's got an awesome fucking name.
[36:16.560 --> 36:18.120]  He's royalty free.
[36:18.960 --> 36:21.100]  And he's already done a lot of good for the world.
[36:21.340 --> 36:23.060]  This, I think Johnny Horizon's awesome.
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.920]  I back him fully.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.840]  I do want to say that this also helps me back him.
[36:28.180 --> 36:29.380]  He's friends with Snoopy.
[36:29.800 --> 36:32.380]  There you go.
[36:32.580 --> 36:35.760]  This was part of a pledge that I started looking it up.
[36:35.940 --> 36:41.680]  A part of a pledge that they did with Johnny Horizon was Snoopy pounce on pollution.
[36:42.400 --> 36:44.500]  And it's not just Snoopy.
[36:44.500 --> 36:48.360]  It's Snoopy talking about, join the Johnny Horizon team.
[36:48.540 --> 36:49.620]  It's a winner.
[36:50.380 --> 36:52.020]  And it's Snoopy, full on.
[36:52.220 --> 36:53.220]  Dude, this rocks.
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.120]  He could even start a band and call it, bring me Johnny Horizon.
[36:58.700 --> 37:01.300]  Oh man, we suck.
[37:01.460 --> 37:01.980]  That sucks.
[37:02.460 --> 37:05.840]  We'll have to, here's Johnny Horizon and Burl Ives.
[37:06.900 --> 37:09.900]  We'll have to do some research and look into it further.
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.700]  But guys, I think we might've stumbled on...
[37:12.700 --> 37:13.400]  I love this.
[37:13.400 --> 37:16.560]  ...a mascot and protector who already protects the environment.
[37:16.960 --> 37:19.300]  Why can't he protect our regulation environment?
[37:19.460 --> 37:22.660]  And since he's so fucking popular, or he was so popular,
[37:22.840 --> 37:24.060]  why don't we bring him back to prominence?
[37:24.100 --> 37:27.060]  Why don't we become the face of anti-littering campaigns in 2025?
[37:27.540 --> 37:28.040]  You know what I'm saying?
[37:28.480 --> 37:29.260]  Why don't we get involved?
[37:29.700 --> 37:32.120]  We're getting onto the 250th year, right?
[37:32.460 --> 37:34.220]  For, it was the bicentennial.
[37:34.340 --> 37:35.800]  What's a 250 year anniversary?
[37:36.020 --> 37:38.000]  Because that's next year, isn't it?
[37:38.280 --> 37:39.660]  It's a very good point.
[37:40.140 --> 37:41.120]  Yeah, what do they call that?
[37:41.460 --> 37:42.000]  I don't know.
[37:42.140 --> 37:43.380]  What's a...
[37:43.750 --> 37:48.630]  Whoa, that's a cool...
[37:50.360 --> 37:57.740]  Semi-quincentennial?
[37:58.580 --> 37:59.320]  What?
[37:59.760 --> 38:01.740]  Semi-quincentennial.
[38:02.260 --> 38:12.840]  Or a sestercentennial, or a quarter millennial, or another thing also written here,
[38:12.840 --> 38:14.580]  the big 250.
[38:18.060 --> 38:21.240]  Guys, there's one more piece to this I just thought I would throw out there.
[38:21.640 --> 38:25.580]  In Twin Falls, Idaho, far from the prying eyes of Washington...
[38:25.580 --> 38:26.000]  I'm reading this.
[38:26.280 --> 38:31.760]  Every April, the town folk gather to honor the memory of their hero on Johnny Horizon Day.
[38:32.100 --> 38:34.260]  They do what he first asked of them in 1965.
[38:34.600 --> 38:36.320]  They clean up the land because it's their land.
[38:36.480 --> 38:41.720]  Every April in Twin Falls, Idaho, they have a Johnny Horizon cleanup Idaho day
[38:41.720 --> 38:44.780]  where everybody gets together and celebrate Johnny Horizon, and they clean up litter.
[38:44.920 --> 38:45.880]  I think we should go to that.
[38:46.300 --> 38:47.500]  I don't think we can go this year, obviously.
[38:47.960 --> 38:54.280]  But I think that should be in our must-visit places around the world, like Deputy,
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.600]  Indiana, the Bean Holes Days, this thing.
[38:59.340 --> 39:02.160]  Now, I'm looking at it.
[39:02.940 --> 39:08.380]  The last proclamation of Johnny Horizon Day was Saturday, May 4th, 2024.
[39:08.920 --> 39:15.580]  And currently, there is no scheduled proclaimed Johnny Horizon Day in...
[39:16.760 --> 39:17.580]  Oh, no.
[39:17.900 --> 39:19.860]  Yeah, in Twin Falls County, Idaho.
[39:20.140 --> 39:22.400]  Then we might be stepping in at the exact right time.
[39:22.540 --> 39:24.200]  Yeah, we need to keep this going.
[39:24.560 --> 39:25.820]  We gotta keep this going.
[39:26.140 --> 39:28.900]  I think Johnny Horizon or Ratty Boy would be real close.
[39:29.120 --> 39:29.580]  I like this.
[39:29.880 --> 39:31.420]  I don't agree with that at all.
[39:31.420 --> 39:34.100]  I think Johnny Horizon would punt Ratty Boy into a lake.
[39:35.620 --> 39:36.160]  You know what?
[39:36.220 --> 39:37.120]  Ratty Boy would like that.
[39:37.120 --> 39:41.520]  Andrew, are you feeling threatened that possibly Johnny Horizon could outshine Johnny Caviar?
[39:42.060 --> 39:43.460]  No, not at all.
[39:43.700 --> 39:45.160]  They are first name related, though.
[39:45.500 --> 39:45.960]  They are.
[39:46.180 --> 39:46.740]  Yeah.
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.780]  Caviar has a level of slime to them that nobody can compare.
[39:53.240 --> 39:55.240]  I'm not worried about being outprestiged.
[39:55.360 --> 39:56.760]  It's not very hard to do.
[39:56.840 --> 39:58.640]  And that's not really Caviar's thing.
[39:59.260 --> 40:03.980]  Is there anything more regulation than a guy without a cigarette and a cowboy hat?
[40:04.040 --> 40:06.500]  The Marlboro man who's not smoking his lungs out?
[40:07.120 --> 40:07.660]  Pretty cool.
[40:08.080 --> 40:09.180]  Yeah, I like it.
[40:09.220 --> 40:10.420]  Johnny Horizon.
[40:10.620 --> 40:12.180]  It's an awesome name.
[40:12.280 --> 40:12.940]  It's pretty cool.
[40:13.080 --> 40:13.620]  I really like Johnny Horizon.
[40:13.720 --> 40:13.900]  Yeah.
[40:14.020 --> 40:17.140]  And again, friends with Snoopy, that's got to count for something.
[40:17.600 --> 40:18.380]  It counts for a lot.
[40:18.700 --> 40:23.080]  I think as a side to this, something I've been meaning to share,
[40:23.140 --> 40:25.660]  I feel like you will especially enjoy this.
[40:26.400 --> 40:30.540]  I went, Geoff, typically you follow that with a name, that phrase.
[40:30.600 --> 40:31.480]  I was just loading up a photo.
[40:32.740 --> 40:35.860]  I went deep into the history of the A&W Burger family
[40:35.860 --> 40:37.780]  because there was a thing quite a while ago
[40:37.780 --> 40:40.960]  where you guys weren't familiar with the A&W Burger family
[40:40.960 --> 40:43.400]  because I don't think it's really a thing in the US.
[40:43.860 --> 40:48.540]  Like all the burgers at A&W in Canada are named after like family members.
[40:48.660 --> 40:52.660]  It's like the Papa Burger or the Mama Burger or the Teen Burger.
[40:53.020 --> 40:56.140]  And I posted something and Eric said, what the fuck is a Teen Burger?
[40:56.380 --> 41:02.700]  And so it led me on a thing of, oh, you guys just know Rudy the Root Bear as your A&W logo.
[41:02.700 --> 41:07.980]  What? We do what? What are you talking about? What the fuck do we know?
[41:08.120 --> 41:09.660]  You don't know about Rudy the Root Bear?
[41:10.020 --> 41:14.660]  Oh, so clearly these idiots only know about Rudy the Root Bear.
[41:15.120 --> 41:17.060]  So let me let me just start with the burger family,
[41:17.080 --> 41:19.000]  because that's the central point of what I want to talk about.
[41:19.020 --> 41:21.400]  I didn't expect having to do a history lesson on Rudy the Root Bear.
[41:21.760 --> 41:24.200]  But when A&W started as a chain,
[41:24.680 --> 41:27.480]  they had a group of characters called the Burger Family.
[41:27.640 --> 41:31.100]  And that was their whole gimmick was that they had burgers and it was a family
[41:31.100 --> 41:34.260]  and they all like burgers and you could order specific burgers of that type.
[41:34.660 --> 41:35.820]  Can I ask a question real fast?
[41:35.960 --> 41:36.480]  Yeah, go ahead.
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.020]  Is this an American company or a Canadian company?
[41:39.320 --> 41:42.420]  So that's a really weird one to answer because it's both.
[41:42.860 --> 41:44.980]  It's an existing brand, but they're owned separately.
[41:45.520 --> 41:45.680]  Yes.
[41:45.700 --> 41:49.380]  So the Canadian version of A&W is completely unique to the American version,
[41:49.680 --> 41:51.120]  although there is overlapping things.
[41:51.320 --> 41:51.700]  There is overlap.
[41:53.620 --> 41:58.480]  There is a degree of overlap, but the burger family still very much prevalent in Canada.
[41:58.480 --> 42:03.340]  They got rid of the burger family when Rudy the Root Bear came into the scene in the US.
[42:04.060 --> 42:06.360]  But when you made an A&W restaurant,
[42:06.620 --> 42:11.980]  you had to bring the family into your rest like it was part of the setting up of it.
[42:12.400 --> 42:17.440]  So all of these giant plaster family statues existed.
[42:17.780 --> 42:21.440]  But then Rudy the Root Bear became way more popular.
[42:21.720 --> 42:23.800]  And so they had to get rid of these statues
[42:24.320 --> 42:26.880]  because they were no longer representatives in the US.
[42:26.880 --> 42:27.820]  They were just characters.
[42:28.560 --> 42:31.900]  So there are communities that are obsessed with, like,
[42:32.020 --> 42:34.560]  trying to track down where these statues ended up.
[42:34.680 --> 42:37.040]  And there's some great resources you can find online
[42:37.040 --> 42:40.860]  of people that have just pursued and or found how they've been repurposed.
[42:41.080 --> 42:47.960]  So this is the Papa Burger, but he has been repainted and is at a car dealership.
[42:47.980 --> 42:48.520]  Oh, my God.
[42:48.540 --> 42:50.020]  He's just a car dealer guy.
[42:50.940 --> 42:52.420]  This is huge.
[42:52.420 --> 42:57.640]  Some Papa Burger and Teen Burger stuff that they found on a mini golf course.
[42:58.140 --> 42:59.500]  Unrelated to A&W.
[43:00.580 --> 43:05.820]  This is Papa Burger that has been repainted and had his eyes changed to look.
[43:06.300 --> 43:08.900]  But like, you could clearly tell it is the same guy.
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.160]  So it is almost like you're saying in the sense of, like,
[43:12.180 --> 43:13.760]  these are characters that have been abandoned,
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.520]  but then adopted by other businesses because restaurants had to sell
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.080]  these giant fucking statues that they didn't have space for.
[43:20.080 --> 43:22.520]  It's like they got fired and had to find other jobs.
[43:25.660 --> 43:32.820]  So as we maybe explore deeper into becoming affiliated with Johnny Horizon,
[43:33.320 --> 43:36.800]  maybe also any listeners, if you catch the burger family around
[43:36.800 --> 43:39.960]  in an unofficial new employment role, let us know.
[43:40.100 --> 43:46.400]  We should find a Papa Burger holder, man, and just snap the head off,
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.940]  face it upwards and make our regulation Ian statue outside the office.
[43:51.200 --> 43:52.400]  Oh, that would be so funny.
[43:52.940 --> 43:55.000]  Just repaint them. I really like that.
[43:56.140 --> 43:58.080]  You're talking about these mascots,
[43:58.160 --> 44:01.180]  and it reminded me of something that I learned not too long ago.
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.720]  You know, the Jack and Diane song at the beginning,
[44:05.820 --> 44:08.780]  where he says sucking on chili dogs outside the Tasty Freeze?
[44:09.580 --> 44:12.440]  You know, it's not about chili, like the hot dog, right?
[44:12.760 --> 44:13.060]  Oh.
[44:13.060 --> 44:17.420]  Chili dogs are what they're slurpy slush puppies are called.
[44:17.640 --> 44:20.420]  Yeah, I mean, I've had a they're my favorite, actually,
[44:20.460 --> 44:22.340]  but I never made that connection in my life.
[44:22.480 --> 44:23.360]  Neither did I.
[44:23.360 --> 44:24.560]  That's the slush puppy dog.
[44:24.580 --> 44:28.460]  Until like a like a few weeks ago, everyone thinks it's sucking on
[44:28.460 --> 44:30.660]  like a chili dog, like a like a hot dog.
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.860]  And it's not. It's it's a slush puppy.
[44:33.260 --> 44:33.740]  Wild.
[44:35.080 --> 44:37.660]  So just to add to how fucked up these things get.
[44:37.960 --> 44:38.760]  Here's another Papa.
[44:39.600 --> 44:41.260]  This is a Papa Burger sprout.
[44:42.160 --> 44:42.500]  What?
[44:42.920 --> 44:44.740]  Wait, what? Hang on.
[44:44.820 --> 44:47.120]  OK, what the fuck? Hang on.
[44:47.460 --> 44:55.100]  He's he's the he's the giant that sells vegetables, but he's holding a brick
[44:55.660 --> 44:57.940]  and he's next to jelly beans.
[44:58.200 --> 45:01.640]  I know. I don't know what business he's promoting there, but yeah,
[45:02.220 --> 45:05.880]  I just the idea of like Papa Burger, the great American family
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.780]  and just seeing all of the roads that they've had to follow since then.
[45:10.020 --> 45:11.020]  I like the one with the ice cream.
[45:11.020 --> 45:12.840]  They didn't put the ice cream on the high up hand.
[45:12.960 --> 45:14.140]  They just have that hand empty.
[45:14.360 --> 45:15.940]  He's just hanging out to the side.
[45:16.460 --> 45:18.400]  These are these are crazy.
[45:18.740 --> 45:20.920]  These are Canada's weird.
[45:21.140 --> 45:22.860]  Why would that be the one you hang on to?
[45:23.000 --> 45:24.360]  A&W, how strange.
[45:24.980 --> 45:29.040]  I've eaten and drank a lot of A&W in my life, and I've never heard of the bear or these guys.
[45:29.100 --> 45:29.460]  That's crazy.
[45:30.040 --> 45:32.760]  Hey, oh, dude, these idiots only know about the root bear.
[45:32.900 --> 45:35.080]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[45:35.180 --> 45:38.340]  Maybe 2025 is the year regulation gives back.
[45:38.440 --> 45:40.220]  This is the year we created the fruit demon.
[45:40.220 --> 45:43.180]  We're encouraging fruit consumption and healthy eating.
[45:43.300 --> 45:46.140]  We're going to we're anti litter now because of Johnny Horizon.
[45:46.340 --> 45:48.560]  We're we're we're a real do-gooder kind of podcast.
[45:49.200 --> 45:51.760]  This is a I want a website where this is collecting them.
[45:51.860 --> 45:53.220]  This is Freaky Papa Burger.
[45:53.840 --> 45:55.060]  Gavin's going to mail his cum everywhere.
[45:55.340 --> 45:56.060]  What the hell?
[45:56.320 --> 45:58.420]  He's a little freaky.
[45:59.300 --> 46:00.040]  Holy hell.
[46:00.220 --> 46:01.400]  He's playing like NFL.
[46:01.580 --> 46:03.400]  He's like playing like NFL Blitz.
[46:03.720 --> 46:04.340]  What is this?
[46:05.160 --> 46:06.700]  The burger looks great on that one.
[46:06.700 --> 46:10.580]  At some point, that will still exist in the world.
[46:10.720 --> 46:12.720]  And everybody who knew what it was.
[46:12.780 --> 46:13.140]  Wow.
[46:14.780 --> 46:15.220]  Wow.
[46:16.060 --> 46:18.340]  Yeah, there'll be no connection to it.
[46:18.720 --> 46:19.760]  It'll just be a creepy.
[46:19.900 --> 46:22.020]  Who made that creepy old guy with the hamburger?
[46:23.700 --> 46:25.440]  Oh, Rudy, the root bears in that.
[46:25.500 --> 46:26.080]  What the fuck?
[46:26.940 --> 46:30.700]  I did something the other day that I haven't done, I think, since I was a kid
[46:31.160 --> 46:32.840]  where I kind of like popped my nut.
[46:33.340 --> 46:33.780]  You know what I mean?
[46:34.900 --> 46:36.480]  No, I definitely.
[46:37.220 --> 46:42.480]  You know, as a kid, you sit funny and you squash a testicle and then it just
[46:42.480 --> 46:44.640]  shoots out somewhere else into the scrotum.
[46:46.720 --> 46:47.880]  Yes, sure, I guess.
[46:47.940 --> 46:50.500]  Yeah, I just would never describe it as pop a nut.
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.720]  I just feel like I had stopped doing that.
[46:54.220 --> 46:58.000]  And then it happened and it was like a painful memory that brought me back to childhood.
[46:59.320 --> 47:00.600]  Slip the ball, maybe.
[47:01.240 --> 47:02.140]  Is that how you would say it?
[47:02.540 --> 47:05.240]  Does it ever worry you what other painful childhood memories
[47:05.240 --> 47:08.860]  there are out there that you forgot that you're someday going to dislodge like a ball?
[47:11.990 --> 47:13.130]  That's actually really fun.
[47:13.190 --> 47:15.790]  Do you think like Evel Knievel had repressed
[47:15.790 --> 47:19.690]  memories and like he'd stub his toe and remember just being lit on fire
[47:19.690 --> 47:21.510]  and falling through like a mountain?
[47:22.010 --> 47:25.790]  I don't like remembering something unpleasant from a long time ago and be like,
[47:25.810 --> 47:27.170]  oh, I didn't think about that for 30 years
[47:27.170 --> 47:29.750]  because God knows what else I haven't thought about for 30 years.
[47:30.830 --> 47:33.790]  Yeah, like I had one of those when we we recently did a
[47:33.790 --> 47:34.910]  we're songs draft.
[47:35.070 --> 47:39.650]  And I was thinking, like, what is just generally genuine, terrible music that I've heard?
[47:39.670 --> 47:43.610]  And it brought back a YouTube video that I hadn't seen in like 17 years
[47:43.610 --> 47:45.250]  and hadn't thought about in that time, either.
[47:45.670 --> 47:48.850]  The premise of having those but for pain is terrifying.
[47:49.470 --> 47:53.290]  I wonder if anybody's ever stubbed their toe, like getting up on their coffee table
[47:53.290 --> 47:57.090]  and then remembered being kidnapped by Russian drug dealers when they were six.
[47:58.290 --> 47:59.890]  And they just repressed it.
[48:00.150 --> 48:02.630]  Oh, that reminded me when the Russian drug dealer stepped on my toe.
[48:02.630 --> 48:03.790]  Oh, fuck, I was kidnapped.
[48:04.610 --> 48:09.410]  Anytime Harry or Marv have to paint a house, it's just trauma.
[48:10.210 --> 48:12.030]  They just see the paint cans.
[48:14.990 --> 48:16.410]  PTSD from a previous career.
[48:17.790 --> 48:20.010]  Oh, man, they would have the worst PTSD, right?
[48:20.690 --> 48:22.150]  They went through a lot, those two.
[48:22.550 --> 48:24.350]  Well, they had a lot of time in prison to think it over.
[48:25.770 --> 48:27.470]  Well, they escaped their family, too.
[48:27.770 --> 48:28.330]  That's true.
[48:28.670 --> 48:31.790]  One of the greatest things anyone has ever given me, by the way, is TPGs.
[48:33.010 --> 48:35.190]  Screenplay for Home Alone 2.
[48:35.470 --> 48:38.370]  I don't even know if it would be, I guess, a direct sequel.
[48:38.590 --> 48:39.910]  Not necessarily two, because there was a two.
[48:40.470 --> 48:42.030]  I had a surprise this week from Meg.
[48:43.330 --> 48:45.930]  She listened to an episode of this podcast.
[48:46.090 --> 48:46.270]  Why?
[48:46.790 --> 48:47.150]  Why?
[48:48.330 --> 48:49.770]  Was it to, like, get you?
[48:50.250 --> 48:52.870]  No, she just thought, you know, other people listen to it.
[48:52.910 --> 48:53.870]  I might as well see what it's all about.
[48:55.030 --> 48:56.250]  What a time to start.
[48:56.650 --> 48:59.250]  I like Meg too much to make her listen to the show.
[49:00.110 --> 49:00.770]  Yeah, what did I know?
[49:00.810 --> 49:01.430]  What did she think?
[49:01.430 --> 49:02.550]  Does she like us less now?
[49:02.930 --> 49:08.190]  Now I think she's going to go back to the beginning of F*** Face and get the whole war going.
[49:08.570 --> 49:12.150]  But she started off by listening to last week's episode.
[49:12.590 --> 49:15.530]  And I've just discovered something slightly disturbing.
[49:16.110 --> 49:19.010]  She's a total Andrew sympathizer.
[49:19.470 --> 49:19.810]  What?
[49:20.730 --> 49:24.170]  Pretty much everything Andrew said, she was like, yeah, I totally get where he's coming from.
[49:24.570 --> 49:25.710]  The enemy from within.
[49:25.910 --> 49:26.230]  Wow.
[49:26.850 --> 49:27.850]  Here's the thing, though, with that.
[49:27.850 --> 49:32.790]  I feel like I saw that way more for that episode than I have for any other episode.
[49:32.990 --> 49:34.230]  That is true.
[49:34.510 --> 49:36.250]  There might be a false confidence.
[49:36.510 --> 49:38.070]  I think that is not going to stick around.
[49:38.350 --> 49:40.710]  So what were we wrong about that you were right about last episode?
[49:41.550 --> 49:44.490]  I think people, not even necessarily wrong, but people are like, oh, yeah,
[49:44.490 --> 49:46.210]  I knew what he meant by sleep amnesia.
[49:47.410 --> 49:48.330]  What was the other thing?
[49:48.370 --> 49:52.990]  There was a lot of stuff like there were an inordinate amount of posts where people are
[49:52.990 --> 49:55.570]  going, I totally sided with Andrew on all this stuff.
[49:55.630 --> 49:57.190]  Oh, I knew exactly who he was talking about.
[49:57.190 --> 50:02.270]  And it's like, I don't even know what it was that we were like squabbling about.
[50:02.390 --> 50:03.970]  Oh, you know what part of it was?
[50:04.330 --> 50:07.090]  The real nerds came out to back me on Peter Molyneux.
[50:07.690 --> 50:09.350]  Oh, the Peter Molyneux stuff!
[50:10.010 --> 50:14.550]  All the real gamer nerds that have spent too much time reading about Peter Molyneux,
[50:14.630 --> 50:16.390]  like I have, were like, no, he is right.
[50:16.810 --> 50:18.710]  A hundred percent Peter Molyneux love.
[50:18.770 --> 50:22.710]  I still stand by Populous, Fable 1, 2 and 3 being awesome fucking games.
[50:22.810 --> 50:23.790]  They're great, great games.
[50:23.910 --> 50:25.790]  And I appreciate Peter Molyneux for this.
[50:26.090 --> 50:27.050]  I appreciate those as well.
[50:27.050 --> 50:29.470]  Maybe the, maybe the full name thing too.
[50:29.990 --> 50:31.390]  Oh yeah, that was another one.
[50:31.450 --> 50:32.370]  Yeah, that was something.
[50:32.530 --> 50:35.510]  I was surprised people don't put their full, like, what do you think full name is?
[50:35.950 --> 50:38.710]  Like if the glass is full, I can't fit any more into it.
[50:39.030 --> 50:40.490]  That's what I learned about burger eating.
[50:41.510 --> 50:41.870]  What?
[50:42.670 --> 50:45.730]  That was, that was when I would, you know, going back to the old things.
[50:45.890 --> 50:47.470]  That was just how stomachs work.
[50:47.590 --> 50:47.910]  Oh, the burger confidence?
[50:47.910 --> 50:48.990]  So I could never do the burger challenge.
[50:48.990 --> 50:51.490]  He's going back to fucking phase 32.
[50:53.250 --> 50:55.230]  That's what I learned about burger eating.
[50:55.230 --> 50:57.310]  Well, whatever I hear, there's a limit.
[50:57.470 --> 50:58.610]  That's always what I imagine.
[50:59.210 --> 51:03.650]  Because you eat, you, you, when you go in, you sort of have this idea that like your stomach
[51:03.650 --> 51:05.330]  is endless, but that's not how that works.
[51:05.450 --> 51:06.650]  It's like you have a glass.
[51:06.810 --> 51:09.390]  I don't think I've ever thought my stomach was endless.
[51:09.730 --> 51:09.990]  Yeah.
[51:10.010 --> 51:12.330]  But you also don't think much about food in general.
[51:12.390 --> 51:16.210]  So that's, I would never accuse you of ever having, uh,
[51:17.070 --> 51:19.550]  eyes greater than your stomach, whatever that phrase is.
[51:19.770 --> 51:22.550]  It is interesting though, to think about your eating speed,
[51:22.550 --> 51:26.670]  like the speed that it physically moves out of your stomach into your intestines.
[51:26.950 --> 51:32.090]  Could you just keep food coming like a conveyor belt at the exact speed of your digestion?
[51:34.070 --> 51:35.770]  Uh, theoretically, I think you could.
[51:36.030 --> 51:36.890]  I think you could.
[51:36.970 --> 51:42.410]  But I think that song that goes do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
[51:42.410 --> 51:43.350]  would have to do it.
[51:43.430 --> 51:46.990]  And we'd have to see the food going down conveyor belt style into your stomach
[51:46.990 --> 51:48.550]  and then down out of your ass.
[51:48.830 --> 51:50.010]  It also takes too long.
[51:51.110 --> 51:54.430]  That was my problem, is whenever we do these burger bets and I would lose them,
[51:54.490 --> 51:56.710]  it was because the digestion took longer than the bet.
[51:56.950 --> 51:59.890]  It was like, oh, I got no time to refuel.
[52:00.430 --> 52:02.350]  Well, yeah, that's the whole point is, like,
[52:02.370 --> 52:05.730]  it's not interesting if you ate a hundred hamburgers over the space of a year.
[52:06.050 --> 52:07.430]  And yet we're counting hot dogs.
[52:08.410 --> 52:09.070]  Well, that's true.
[52:13.830 --> 52:15.030]  Megan agreed with me on that one.
[52:15.110 --> 52:18.090]  Oh, people also agreed with you on the Acclaim logo. That's right.
[52:18.090 --> 52:18.790]  Meg.
[52:19.450 --> 52:20.650]  I said Megan. That was weird.
[52:23.030 --> 52:24.690]  Make sure she listens to that.
[52:24.930 --> 52:25.670]  Yeah, that was strange.
[52:26.090 --> 52:28.590]  Well, she started at the beginning now, so she wouldn't hear this one.
[52:29.730 --> 52:32.130]  Oh, that's good. Slip that in. That's pretty good.
[52:32.170 --> 52:34.150]  I've already lost Meg by this point.
[52:34.190 --> 52:35.230]  That's fine. Never mind.
[52:35.710 --> 52:39.370]  It's one thing to go back and listen to 250 episodes of,
[52:39.510 --> 52:44.230]  or I guess 280 episodes, no, 250 episodes of a show.
[52:45.010 --> 52:47.470]  But it's another thing to go back and listen to 250
[52:47.470 --> 52:50.070]  episodes of a show starring your husband,
[52:50.510 --> 52:53.310]  that all happened in your house while you were living there.
[52:53.370 --> 52:58.230]  What a weird, like, she's going to have so many memory connections
[52:58.230 --> 53:02.410]  to things that happened in the house that she's going to have context for now.
[53:02.510 --> 53:03.030]  You know what I mean?
[53:03.370 --> 53:05.350]  Yeah. And it's a real time capsule too.
[53:05.410 --> 53:10.090]  She's about to fill in the last five years of confusion in her life.
[53:11.590 --> 53:15.350]  Yeah, I think the first episode is a half an hour conversation about turnip prices
[53:15.870 --> 53:16.750]  in Animal Crossing.
[53:17.470 --> 53:18.470]  Kicked it all off.
[53:19.130 --> 53:22.990]  I'm in a new era personally because I'm I'm on that CPAP now.
[53:23.390 --> 53:24.090]  I'm a threat.
[53:24.350 --> 53:25.230]  Oh, yeah.
[53:25.650 --> 53:26.710]  Danger to society.
[53:26.990 --> 53:27.870]  How'd you sleep last night?
[53:28.310 --> 53:30.030]  Uh, it's it's been a journey.
[53:30.090 --> 53:32.650]  It's been a little bit of roller coaster overall.
[53:33.270 --> 53:38.550]  So I started and I fell asleep and I had a great sleep and I woke up
[53:38.550 --> 53:43.410]  and then we've been doing Mario Party March where every morning I have to get up
[53:44.050 --> 53:48.170]  and play one turn and then previously would just go back to sleep.
[53:49.290 --> 53:54.030]  I went to bed early because I thought, I don't know how this is going to impact my sleep.
[53:54.290 --> 53:55.230]  So I'm going to be careful.
[53:55.370 --> 54:01.270]  So I went to bed at 830, woke up at 1130, was awake for about an hour,
[54:01.610 --> 54:05.370]  then went back to sleep and woke up at around 5 a.m.
[54:05.830 --> 54:08.890]  and thought, I'll just stay awake to be safe, to be cautious.
[54:09.690 --> 54:12.510]  I did that for an hour and then I got kind of sleepy again.
[54:12.510 --> 54:17.350]  And I thought, I can sleep for 45 minutes and trust that I'll set my alarm as I did.
[54:17.410 --> 54:18.110]  Everything's fine.
[54:18.650 --> 54:25.550]  I then woke up to with my partner standing above me and all of the lights on in the bedroom
[54:26.190 --> 54:28.290]  saying, you're late, you're late.
[54:29.170 --> 54:30.490]  I'd slept through.
[54:30.870 --> 54:32.150]  It was the wildest.
[54:32.170 --> 54:34.030]  Like, I guess I had like.
[54:35.170 --> 54:38.890]  Six months of bad sleep that I cleansed in one evening
[54:38.890 --> 54:43.370]  and they had spent like 15 minutes trying to wake me and they could not wake me.
[54:44.230 --> 54:48.570]  And I woke up in such a panic rushing to that Mario Party turn
[54:49.130 --> 54:55.650]  because we had recently done a pet peeves draft and one of us drafted general lateness.
[54:55.870 --> 55:02.390]  So when I heard you're late, my first thought was, oh, no, this person's going to be so peeved.
[55:02.590 --> 55:06.550]  And so I panicked and none of my setup would work.
[55:06.550 --> 55:09.410]  And it was great because you all were like, what's going on?
[55:09.430 --> 55:12.330]  And I'm like, I'm so sorry, I just started CPAP.
[55:12.390 --> 55:14.450]  And then there was a lot of excitement around it.
[55:14.450 --> 55:15.970]  Yeah, because you sounded completely different.
[55:16.090 --> 55:17.870]  You didn't sound like morning and croaky.
[55:17.950 --> 55:22.350]  You were like, oh, hey, sorry, I just had a really great sleep.
[55:22.670 --> 55:23.990]  We talked about it later.
[55:24.150 --> 55:27.410]  It was like it was like talking to an Andrew from 2022.
[55:27.930 --> 55:28.990]  It was so weird.
[55:29.130 --> 55:31.350]  You were a different person.
[55:31.530 --> 55:34.570]  And I think we all immediately loved it.
[55:34.610 --> 55:35.030]  It was great.
[55:35.030 --> 55:41.650]  No offense to current Andrew, but we were just really excited to see how rested you were.
[55:41.790 --> 55:46.250]  I don't think you sounded that like just at peace with yourself in a year.
[55:46.690 --> 55:47.970]  Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[55:48.210 --> 55:52.030]  Well, we also like I'm generally not a morning person, which is tough, especially with CPAP
[55:52.030 --> 55:55.790]  stuff. And just with the time zones, I have to get up earlier than you guys for everything
[55:55.790 --> 55:59.430]  that we do or start earlier than I would necessarily enjoy.
[55:59.430 --> 56:03.790]  But so we did that.
[56:03.790 --> 56:08.230]  And then I went back to bed after that Mario Party turn like this is a great sleep.
[56:08.370 --> 56:10.850]  I just slept essentially that whole day.
[56:11.010 --> 56:11.710]  It was crazy.
[56:11.990 --> 56:12.930]  Put the mask on.
[56:13.030 --> 56:13.430]  Come on.
[56:13.450 --> 56:18.830]  The only problem I had was that well, actually a few problems, but one of them was that it's
[56:18.830 --> 56:20.710]  created a bruise on my nose.
[56:20.930 --> 56:22.510]  I need to get a different mask.
[56:24.490 --> 56:27.350]  It's just it doesn't quite fit right and clamp it down.
[56:27.350 --> 56:31.930]  But the bigger problem was I realized that I don't know how sleep works anymore.
[56:32.070 --> 56:38.830]  I'm having to reeducate myself on sleep because when you are never actually getting good sleep,
[56:38.830 --> 56:41.590]  you constantly have the ability to sleep.
[56:41.910 --> 56:47.290]  So I slept the whole day and then I laid in bed at like 11 p.m.
[56:47.290 --> 56:51.330]  that night and I put the mask on and I sat there for 30 minutes.
[56:51.530 --> 56:52.590]  And just it was so weird.
[56:52.730 --> 56:55.110]  Sleep didn't occur as I guess.
[56:55.170 --> 56:56.270]  I guess I'm just not sleepy.
[56:56.270 --> 56:58.250]  I guess I just can't just sleep.
[56:59.350 --> 57:03.930]  And so then I fucked up my sleep that night because like I slept too much during the day.
[57:04.210 --> 57:07.390]  I haven't had to think about like, oh, I need to.
[57:07.530 --> 57:08.630]  I have so much of this.
[57:09.110 --> 57:10.270]  I can overdo this.
[57:10.750 --> 57:11.910]  So that was the whole thing.
[57:12.950 --> 57:15.110]  First night of CPAP, it was like I was in a time machine.
[57:15.290 --> 57:17.430]  I would instantly fall asleep for like eight hours.
[57:17.450 --> 57:17.930]  It was great.
[57:18.350 --> 57:21.590]  Second night, disaster because I had spent so much time sleeping.
[57:21.990 --> 57:26.090]  The previous terrible sleep couldn't get the mask to fit properly
[57:26.090 --> 57:28.970]  because I do still have a giant head and I don't.
[57:29.090 --> 57:32.590]  The straps barely work, but I do get them to work at certain angles.
[57:35.010 --> 57:36.530]  I experienced your thing, Gavin.
[57:36.630 --> 57:38.410]  I had a gassy gut yesterday.
[57:39.130 --> 57:40.210]  I sure did.
[57:42.390 --> 57:43.430]  I woke up.
[57:43.490 --> 57:44.870]  I was like, oh, this is real unpleasant.
[57:44.990 --> 57:46.230]  I don't want to deal with this.
[57:46.730 --> 57:47.890]  I see what he was talking about.
[57:48.190 --> 57:49.610]  Did it come out your mouth or your anus?
[57:50.730 --> 57:51.530]  Anus for sure.
[57:52.530 --> 57:56.950]  I had to use the bathroom and I didn't realize that until I was on the toilet of like,
[57:57.050 --> 57:58.750]  oh boy, I am aired up right now.
[57:58.830 --> 57:59.810]  This is crazy.
[58:00.870 --> 58:05.890]  I actually think that the air was probably the cause of me having to use the bathroom.
[58:06.410 --> 58:08.650]  Yeah, it was phantom poop pot, potentially.
[58:08.850 --> 58:09.570]  It was, yeah.
[58:10.450 --> 58:11.790]  So that has been that experience.
[58:11.890 --> 58:14.550]  I'm on day three, still learning how sleep works.
[58:14.990 --> 58:16.150]  I think I'm going to get there.
[58:16.490 --> 58:20.130]  I love the fact that you've been operating this whole like last six months,
[58:20.130 --> 58:23.470]  like one of those old phones that when they run a battery,
[58:23.630 --> 58:26.430]  if you just wait a bit, you can turn it back on and it will operate
[58:27.590 --> 58:30.850]  at dog shit levels until it turns off again.
[58:31.030 --> 58:32.710]  You've just been doing life like that.
[58:32.730 --> 58:34.350]  It's like a drained phone battery.
[58:34.870 --> 58:36.950]  Yeah, but now it's expectation.
[58:38.170 --> 58:45.430]  So I've had an issue where this morning I went to sleep and now when I wake up from CPAP
[58:45.430 --> 58:47.130]  and it's a good CPAP sleep, I'll go like,
[58:47.130 --> 58:52.310]  Oh, how far into the future have I gone now in this magical?
[58:52.950 --> 58:56.130]  Oh, wait, this 80 minutes.
[58:56.550 --> 59:00.110]  This is no, no, this is not how this works.
[59:00.610 --> 59:04.730]  So I felt like Superman for one day because it's like the sleep was insane.
[59:05.010 --> 59:06.790]  I was having ridiculous dreams.
[59:06.830 --> 59:10.750]  And now I think I'm just returning to Earth as a normal person.
[59:10.750 --> 59:12.590]  But it is a process.
[59:12.950 --> 59:14.830]  You just discovered drug addiction.
[59:14.830 --> 59:17.310]  The first time you do it, it's so fucking great.
[59:17.430 --> 59:18.570]  It solves all your problems.
[59:18.710 --> 59:19.710]  You have the best day of your life.
[59:19.990 --> 59:21.510]  And then the next day, it's not quite as good.
[59:21.530 --> 59:22.270]  It's not quite as good.
[59:22.330 --> 59:24.190]  And you're just like, why the fuck is it like day one?
[59:24.510 --> 59:26.330]  Third day, I'm on it a little bit.
[59:26.390 --> 59:28.570]  But you guys are gonna be like, Oh, man, he's papping too hard.
[59:28.990 --> 59:30.170]  He's got a bruise on his nose.
[59:30.410 --> 59:31.670]  I can see that scam.
[59:32.170 --> 59:33.370]  Andrew, you're out of control, man.
[59:34.990 --> 59:37.170]  So you've gone full face instead of just nose.
[59:38.270 --> 59:42.430]  Yeah, I bought a new mask that I think it will work better for that.
[59:42.430 --> 59:47.630]  Um, I also just not realizing how the how it should work.
[59:47.690 --> 59:50.930]  Like, I don't think I had a good seal on it the first night I used it at all,
[59:50.930 --> 59:54.290]  because it just keeps blowing air into your face.
[59:55.970 --> 59:57.490]  And I had to sneeze.
[59:57.590 --> 59:58.410]  That's another thing.
[59:58.450 --> 59:59.270]  I'm learning new things.
[59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.650]  I had my first CPAP sneeze last night.
[01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:02.670]  That was a panic.
[01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:03.770]  Terrifying.
[01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:07.170]  You get all strapped up and then you realize you have to sneeze.
[01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.490]  There's five seconds of trying to get the mask off because I feel like
[01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:14.610]  sneezing in a CPAP mask, a full face mask, would be terrible.
[01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.910]  What if CPAP was short for CPAP smear?
[01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:24.050]  Oh, that would be a different product then, I think, if that's what it was.
[01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.770]  Trying to figure out what that what that product would do.
[01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.870]  Yeah, I'm trying to think if there's anything I'm still learning.
[01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.390]  I'll give an update next week.
[01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:35.290]  I'm sure I will continue to learn things of how humans actually operate.
[01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:38.970]  But I had to get used to the fact that there was something on my face.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:42.090]  Before I went with the nose one, I had the whole mouth and nose one.
[01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:46.470]  And I tried to take a pill and I forgot to take the thing off.
[01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:49.390]  Just crashed into my face and flew onto the floor.
[01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.830]  You kind of just forget that you've got something right there.
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:56.310]  I just visualize when I have problems with it and not that I've had problems.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:00.850]  But my strategy going in was that I'm just a fighter pilot in Independence Day
[01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:04.370]  with my mask and I'm not going to be a bitch like Harry Connick Jr.
[01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.390]  and rip that mask off.
[01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.670]  I'm going to I'm locked in.
[01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.250]  I'm not going to crash my goddamn jet.
[01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.630]  Why did he take the mask off?
[01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:15.450]  I don't know, because I think in the movie it's like he runs out of oxygen.
[01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.390]  But that's the thing that provides the oxygen, I think.
[01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:22.050]  Yeah, well, I mean, if you if you're connected to air and the air runs out,
[01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:25.310]  it is worse to be breathing an empty pipe than just the air.
[01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:27.230]  That's true. It'll squeeze your face.
[01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:31.410]  We've recently learned if you try to breathe into an empty pipe.
[01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:33.590]  But that has been my CPAP journey.
[01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:34.570]  I'll keep you updated.
[01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:35.650]  Gavin has been texting me.
[01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.510]  I at some point I ran out of water.
[01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.430]  I guess I got to change the water on it.
[01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.130]  Does yours use distilled water?
[01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.910]  Yes.
[01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:44.730]  So you're a.
[01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:48.090]  This is probably my biggest piece of advice to you with the PAP.
[01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:53.250]  And because you're a messy bastard, you clean it, clean it, clean it every week.
[01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.350]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:56.470]  Can I express some ignorance?
[01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:58.090]  What is the water for?
[01:01:58.730 --> 01:01:59.850]  It's a humidifier.
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.610]  So I thought it just pumped oxygen into you.
[01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:04.150]  I didn't realize it was humid oxygen.
[01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.070]  Me neither. Had no idea.
[01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:08.310]  Well, it's not. It's just air. It's just pumping air.
[01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:09.730]  Oh, OK.
[01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:11.870]  I did have. You know what, Gavin?
[01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.490]  You just use nose, right? You don't use the full mask?
[01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.110]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:21.010]  I had an issue last night where I took some air in and I stored it in my cheeks.
[01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.130]  Oh, that'll happen again.
[01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.610]  Like a squirrel with nuts.
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.430]  And because of that, I could never.
[01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.970]  It was then pumping too much air.
[01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:31.330]  I can never adjust the balance because it thought too much.
[01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:34.070]  The air was more air was needed than actually was.
[01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.550]  I did not know how to.
[01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:38.050]  I had to take the whole mask off because I didn't know how to
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:42.750]  react or counter the amount of airflow that was being shoved into my face.
[01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.070]  Yeah, that happens to me sometimes, but because I have the
[01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:47.630]  just the nose thing on, I can vent.
[01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:52.230]  So if my cheeks are puffed up, sometimes I'll be like nodding off and I'll come back around.
[01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.410]  My cheeks will be full of air and I just have to be like...
[01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.010]  I don't got a vent.
[01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:03.850]  I don't have a vent, so I need to figure out that system, I guess.
[01:03:03.850 --> 01:03:09.070]  It must be such a good night of sleep because it sounds like you guys have made sleep so complicated.
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.370]  If you can sleep without one, you're lucky.
[01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:14.330]  It is nice.
[01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.290]  I haven't slept this good since I was... I don't know.
[01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:19.090]  It's been a while.
[01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.690]  It's been a few different apartments.
[01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:25.830]  It's crazy to just close your eyes and then wake up and it's different.
[01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.590]  The time is completely different.
[01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.230]  So what would it be before, though?
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.670]  Because you said you used to just be sat up.
[01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:39.310]  I'd sit up and then I would fall asleep and then I'd wake up and I'd look at my phone and it would
[01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:43.790]  probably be like 50 minutes, 50 minutes later.
[01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:51.730]  When I did my test, I had like 105 disturbances an hour and I'm averaging less than one.
[01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.830]  So it is a dramatically different sleep experience.
[01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:59.870]  And I was getting like 20 something an hour and that was enough to prescribe a CPAP.
[01:04:00.730 --> 01:04:03.910]  So the fact that you had a hundred, that was like, that's almost two a minute.
[01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.770]  Yeah, I was doing burger numbers.
[01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:08.230]  I didn't even know it.
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:10.730]  That's crazy.
[01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:12.770]  I'm so happy that you're going to become a regular human.
[01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:16.670]  You're going to become like a superpowered man who can sleep.
[01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.990]  It's crazy.
[01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:22.090]  But realizing that it's not a superpower and that you have to, you have to limit it.
[01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:26.110]  It's not a time machine because it really felt like a time machine after night one.
[01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:28.890]  And as I said, being brought back to earth on it.
[01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:31.070]  You have to use your power responsibly.
[01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:33.270]  I, yeah, I'm cleaning it too.
[01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:38.290]  Just like the idea of like one, one second it was pitch black and you were just testing this thing out.
[01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:40.810]  And then suddenly you're six minutes late for Mario Party.
[01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:42.170]  Terrified.
[01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:43.970]  Not even knowing that I could be.
[01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.410]  I drank a Red Bull in that time as well.
[01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:52.630]  When you told us that it was CPAP, it changed everyone's tune from like, oh, we're going to give
[01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:54.710]  him shit to dude, that's so odd.
[01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:55.810]  Oh, I'm so happy for you.
[01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:56.930]  You were also supportive.
[01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.710]  It was so sweet.
[01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:02.630]  It was, we were so supportive and then thought about it later and went like he, the way you
[01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:05.030]  sounded, I know Geoff brought it up earlier, but like.
[01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:08.510]  It was so, hey, what's going on?
[01:05:08.590 --> 01:05:10.950]  You were different, you were a different person.
[01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:15.910]  Hey, it was like, are you okay?
[01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.930]  I think I was still very much out of it.
[01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:25.850]  And if it was another scenario, me being seven minutes late.
[01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:31.590]  I either would have been much more aggressively apologetic and or much more just prepared to
[01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:33.030]  defend myself for whatever had occurred.
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:37.950]  I think the fact that we're playing Mario Party so early for you every morning is really
[01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:39.130]  detrimental to your gameplay.
[01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:42.050]  Like you're making some nuts decisions.
[01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:43.510]  I disagree there.
[01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:48.530]  So we filmed turn 14 today, which if you haven't watched, please check this.
[01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:49.350]  We're doing a thing.
[01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:50.450]  We're playing Mario Party every day.
[01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:54.630]  I'm sure, you know, but we're doing it every day and we're releasing it the following day.
[01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.670]  We're doing 30 turns, so 30 consecutive days of this.
[01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:00.110]  We are at turn 15.
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.090]  We just did turn 14 today, or I guess tomorrow we'll do 15.
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:10.090]  And it has been an insane process because we do it first thing in the morning every day.
[01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:12.350]  For me, at least 630 a.m.
[01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.230]  Yeah, that's when I wake up.
[01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:16.070]  It's such a weird way to start the day.
[01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:19.390]  Yeah, we are waking up together every day for a month.
[01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:23.470]  And I'm very excited for that to end, as much as I also love
[01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.150]  spending that morning time with you all.
[01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:28.470]  I don't think it impacted my gameplay today.
[01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:33.350]  My bad sleep apnea night definitely impacted the mini game I did with Geoff,
[01:06:33.370 --> 01:06:36.770]  where we had to do basic math on rotating a platform.
[01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:41.430]  Oh my god, what a day of that, man.
[01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:42.150]  That was crazy.
[01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:44.050]  I reached out to Geoff as soon as we finished.
[01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:45.190]  I said, that was on me.
[01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:46.370]  I will make up for it.
[01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:48.250]  It was brutal.
[01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.390]  That was so funny.
[01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:50.750]  He apologized to me.
[01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.530]  Because I could handle one.
[01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:55.750]  So it was a thing where there'd be three things you needed to dodge.
[01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.490]  And I was really good at locking in on making sure one of those things didn't happen.
[01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:02.370]  And I could not do anything about the other things.
[01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:04.230]  Which is not helpful.
[01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:07.650]  It's pretty fun though, to be on a Saturday playing it and then looking at the map and
[01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:11.810]  being like, oh, I'm excited to go past that spot maybe in the middle of next week.
[01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:12.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:14.730]  Look out Wednesday, here I come.
[01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:20.650]  I get really excited at like 6 a.m. every day if I happen to be awake.
[01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:25.410]  Like once the turn is within about an hour or so, like, oh, what's going to happen?
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:27.070]  Who's going to steal something?
[01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:28.310]  It's been a lot of fun.
[01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:34.230]  And it's been surprisingly less heated than I would anticipate to this point.
[01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:39.970]  But I think that is only going to crank up now as we head into the back half of this game.
[01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.090]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:43.810]  Shit's starting to feel a little real.
[01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:44.750]  It is.
[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:50.090]  There's under the table dealings that have occurred, bribes that have been made.
[01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:51.790]  Some star theft.
[01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.270]  Some star theft.
[01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.790]  Backstabbing.
[01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:56.030]  Backstabbing.
[01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:57.270]  Some frontstabbing.
[01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:58.750]  Some frontstabbing.
[01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:00.930]  Reconciliation, potentially.
[01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.990]  Nope.
[01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:03.790]  But that's all video game talk.
[01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:05.350]  We don't really talk about that on the main podcast.
[01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:09.790]  We do hope you check it out, though, because it's fucking free and we don't know how to
[01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:11.070]  make it easier to watch than that.
[01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:12.010]  It is.
[01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:13.250]  It's on our Patreon every day.
[01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:17.250]  I guess I could come to your house and show it to you on an iPad every day.
[01:08:20.190 --> 01:08:23.850]  Can you imagine the frequent flyer miles you could rack up doing that?
[01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:29.470]  Traveling via an iPad the show like it's the Wu-Tang album.
[01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:34.110]  We should probably wrap up, though.
[01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:35.350]  We've been going for a little bit.
[01:08:35.730 --> 01:08:37.530]  I do want to throw this out there before we leave.
[01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:41.150]  One last idea, since we're kind of in a draft era, I feel like right now.
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:41.950]  I'm really enjoying it.
[01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:46.550]  I want to throw another one I had onto the pile if you like, if you guys like it.
[01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:47.930]  I already I already pitched it to some of you.
[01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:49.590]  One hit wonder draft.
[01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:50.770]  Yes.
[01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:52.790]  OK, there you go.
[01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:53.170]  All right.
[01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:54.450]  That doesn't have to be music.
[01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:56.230]  That could be there's all kinds of one hit wonders.
[01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:00.790]  Yeah, as immediately I and I say this as a big fan of the product itself.
[01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:04.490]  I don't think the Big League Chew guy did anything else but Big League Chew.
[01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.850]  Yeah, I have so many that are so good immediately.
[01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.750]  I don't want to say them out loud because I don't want to lose them.
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:10.330]  You know what I mean?
[01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.270]  Don't want to give the good ideas up.
[01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:14.070]  But yeah, one hit wonder draft, I think could be a real good one.
[01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:15.630]  So we should throw that on the pile first.
[01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.190]  At some point in the undefined future.
[01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:19.890]  Sorry, specifically about the Big League Chew thing.
[01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:21.790]  That guy's a major league baseball player, wasn't he?
[01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.290]  He played for the Portland Hawks.
[01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:27.070]  I don't know if he did.
[01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:28.090]  Did he play in the MLB?
[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:29.670]  I thought he was an MLB.
[01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.230]  He could easily be either either either way.
[01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.970]  I thought that was a that was a very funny example to be like,
[01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:37.390]  this guy's never done anything major league player.
[01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:38.010]  Oh, shit.
[01:09:38.010 --> 01:09:41.070]  He played baseball at definitely a professional level.
[01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:42.230]  That is true.
[01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:45.170]  But Big League Chew, though, that was his hit.
[01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:48.750]  He was a role player in the dugout and the field.
[01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:49.410]  Yeah.
[01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:55.010]  Where was his soccer slam or his football fruities or his other sports related gums?
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:10:01.410]  In an era where they got rid of all the candy that resembled tobacco, he he ran through it.
[01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:02.610]  He held on.
[01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:03.730]  He made it through that storm.
[01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:06.230]  He's the sole survivor of that.
[01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.490]  Yeah, you got a dick sporting goods right now and they sell a tub of Big League Chew
[01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:12.630]  right at the counter as you walk out.
[01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.370]  You won't see candy cigarettes anywhere.
[01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:17.090]  No, it's a lie about what they are.
[01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:18.790]  They're just like candy sticks now.
[01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:20.030]  Terrible.
[01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:23.950]  Do you think we should ever revisit any of our previous discussions from the podcast
[01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:25.190]  from before drafts?
[01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:29.410]  Like at one point we were talking about the best sequels, but for anything?
[01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:30.790]  Well, we should.
[01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:33.590]  We also talked about doing a worst third movies draft, too.
[01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:34.570]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:38.690]  Man, I don't want to overload the audience with drafts, but I feel like I feel like we
[01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:40.070]  got so many good drafts on deck.
[01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:42.190]  I don't think that is a thing.
[01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:43.610]  What, the audience?
[01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:44.430]  No, they exist.
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:46.450]  They're there, dude.
[01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.090]  I promise you they're there.
[01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:50.330]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.410]  Outside of my house?
[01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:54.130]  Outside of our homes?
[01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:59.330]  We got Meg on.
[01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:00.950]  We gotta wrap this up.
[01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:03.690]  Somebody end this thing.
[01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:07.090]  Now that Andrew's sleeping at night, he's discovering that there's an outside world.
[01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.330]  Wait a second.
[01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.210]  Are you telling me that these things go out to people?
[01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:14.610]  I think now I'm starting to understand his Costco confusion a little bit better.
[01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:18.290]  Thanks for listening to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.010]  We really hope you enjoyed it.
[01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:21.710]  If you did, maybe go on over to our Patreon.
[01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:23.730]  We are The Regulation Pod over on Patreon.
[01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:29.730]  And consider watching some of those gameplay videos for free or maybe even becoming a member,
[01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:31.250]  a paying member or not.
[01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.650]  I don't care one way or the other.
[01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.070]  I just want you to be happy.
[01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:37.410]  I want you to be the happiest you can be throughout the course of your day.
[01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:41.230]  And for some people, that includes Patreon content.
[01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:42.330]  For a whole lot of people.
[01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.230]  Eight people in the world, right?
[01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:45.390]  Whole lot of people that doesn't.
[01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:46.690]  But there are a few that it does.
[01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:48.170]  So if you're one of those people, that'd be cool.
[01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:52.550]  Anyway, we sure enjoyed hanging out and having this dumb conversation with you.
[01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:56.970]  And hopefully we will see you next week for another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:59.450]  I can't believe you didn't let Nick do the outro.
[01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:01.510]  Yeah, I thought you did a great job though.
[01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:02.470]  We'll see you next time.
[01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:03.130]  Bye!
[01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:04.750]  Don't inhale popcorn!
[01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:05.170]  Bye!
