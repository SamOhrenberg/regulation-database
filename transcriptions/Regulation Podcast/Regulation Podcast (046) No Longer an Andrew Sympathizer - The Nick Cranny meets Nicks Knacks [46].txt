[00:00.000 --> 00:01.260]  Is my line fatter?
[00:02.280 --> 00:02.960]  Fat lines.
[00:03.460 --> 00:04.360]  You got a big fat line?
[00:04.660 --> 00:05.900]  I got like fat silence.
[00:06.980 --> 00:07.860]  Fat lines!
[00:09.260 --> 00:11.200]  Like normally, silence is skinny.
[00:12.160 --> 00:14.620]  Do you need to take a minute to look at your fat silence?
[00:15.400 --> 00:15.620]  Yeah.
[00:16.740 --> 00:17.180]  No.
[00:18.780 --> 00:19.000]  Okay.
[00:20.200 --> 00:23.320]  Just concerned with it out loud, but then asked if we want to fix it.
[00:23.440 --> 00:23.700]  No.
[00:24.220 --> 00:25.140]  Cool. Right on.
[00:25.280 --> 00:27.460]  Because technically the podcast hasn't started yet.
[00:27.560 --> 00:29.700]  Now would be the time to fix it.
[00:30.000 --> 00:30.820]  That's true.
[00:30.880 --> 00:34.760]  It's way, it's way easier to fix it before we record than after.
[00:35.320 --> 00:37.240]  When I expand it, it's skinny still.
[00:37.640 --> 00:40.480]  But when it's normal size, it's fat.
[00:42.660 --> 00:44.260]  Which do you normally record in?
[00:44.560 --> 00:45.760]  The skinny or the big one?
[00:46.680 --> 00:47.380]  Full size.
[00:47.920 --> 00:49.580]  Well, usually it's small.
[00:50.420 --> 00:50.680]  Okay.
[00:51.240 --> 00:54.340]  You, you, you heard him say that and you said, okay.
[00:55.260 --> 00:56.160]  Okay. It's fine.
[00:57.140 --> 00:57.660]  Oh, okay.
[00:57.900 --> 00:58.700]  Said it very reluctantly.
[00:59.220 --> 01:02.360]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:02.600 --> 01:03.580]  This is number 46.
[01:03.760 --> 01:04.700]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:04.820 --> 01:08.860]  With me, as always, Gavin Free, Andrew Panton, Nick Schwartz, Eric Badour.
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.080]  How's everyone doing?
[01:10.480 --> 01:13.160]  Meg is no longer an Andrew Sympathizer.
[01:13.400 --> 01:13.800]  Yeah.
[01:14.780 --> 01:15.180]  Yeah.
[01:15.440 --> 01:15.620]  Yeah.
[01:15.720 --> 01:15.900]  Yeah.
[01:15.900 --> 01:16.380]  I said that.
[01:16.560 --> 01:17.180]  I figured that was happening.
[01:17.420 --> 01:17.540]  Yeah.
[01:17.540 --> 01:18.100]  I said that.
[01:18.440 --> 01:18.840]  Yeah.
[01:18.920 --> 01:20.100]  Andrew predicted correctly.
[01:20.460 --> 01:20.520]  Yeah.
[01:20.720 --> 01:20.940]  Yeah.
[01:20.980 --> 01:21.080]  Yeah.
[01:21.180 --> 01:21.560]  Yeah.
[01:21.720 --> 01:21.820]  Yeah.
[01:21.940 --> 01:25.200]  I think that was a reasonable episode to come into.
[01:25.560 --> 01:28.620]  I've been adding to a list of places that you lost to.
[01:31.680 --> 01:40.000]  Including White Chocolates for Arseholes, Monkey Movies are Good, and Wiping Standing Up.
[01:40.500 --> 01:44.580]  Monkey Movies are Good is, is just a, that's a, she's wrong about that one.
[01:45.020 --> 01:45.940]  Not being good.
[01:46.460 --> 01:47.340]  Monkey Movies are great.
[01:47.840 --> 01:48.060]  Yeah.
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.680]  I remember Project X with Matthew Broderick.
[01:49.720 --> 01:50.240]  That was a great film.
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.900]  She was also really excited to listen to, uh, watch a lot of Dunstan Checks In.
[01:56.020 --> 01:58.420]  And then I had to break the news that we never actually did that.
[01:58.420 --> 02:00.320]  Oh, we didn't?
[02:00.600 --> 02:01.720]  It's so funny.
[02:02.420 --> 02:10.100]  Yeah, I was, I was talking to Meg over the weekend and I asked her if she could just keep a list of all the things we said we were going to do that we never did for us.
[02:11.420 --> 02:13.000]  Maybe revisit it at some point.
[02:15.240 --> 02:17.360]  The Planet of the Apes movies alone, I mean.
[02:17.960 --> 02:18.680]  Space Chimps.
[02:19.060 --> 02:19.280]  Those don't count.
[02:19.840 --> 02:20.440]  Those don't count.
[02:20.580 --> 02:22.380]  What do you mean the Planet of the Apes movies don't count?
[02:22.480 --> 02:23.940]  They're the most monkey movies ever.
[02:23.940 --> 02:31.840]  Of all, of all the stuff that she said that she doesn't sympathize with you about or whatever, like she had like a change of heart.
[02:32.020 --> 02:34.860]  The monkey movie is the thing that's like really tripping you up, man.
[02:34.860 --> 02:36.540]  Well, because I think it's the worst take.
[02:36.940 --> 02:41.440]  I think my other takes I could see, not liking monkey movies, it's crazy.
[02:43.740 --> 02:45.420]  That is the hill I will die on.
[02:46.080 --> 02:46.700]  MVP 2.
[02:47.060 --> 02:48.480]  The MVP 2 alone.
[02:49.260 --> 02:50.480]  Forget Dunstan Checks In.
[02:50.960 --> 02:52.000]  That's the watch alone.
[02:52.620 --> 02:53.260]  Classic film.
[02:53.260 --> 02:56.160]  What was the Amy Wants Raindrop Drink movie?
[02:56.500 --> 02:58.580]  That was with the white gorillas.
[02:59.380 --> 02:59.900]  Congo!
[03:01.420 --> 03:02.440]  Yeah, that was a good one too.
[03:02.560 --> 03:03.500]  I never saw that one.
[03:05.260 --> 03:11.700]  Amy was the gorilla and she drank martinis to calm down on stressful flights because she wasn't a good flyer.
[03:12.600 --> 03:14.220]  She called it a raindrop drink.
[03:15.560 --> 03:17.460]  Because she could do sign language.
[03:18.520 --> 03:19.240]  My audio.
[03:20.660 --> 03:21.540]  What happened?
[03:21.540 --> 03:24.120]  I think my computer is pulling apart.
[03:26.020 --> 03:28.980]  But we did a whole thing about how you said everything was fine.
[03:29.140 --> 03:32.180]  So now I don't think that was in the episode.
[03:32.400 --> 03:33.880]  I feel like we probably didn't include all of that.
[03:33.940 --> 03:36.060]  It has to be now.
[03:36.680 --> 03:37.720]  Yeah, good job Gavin.
[03:37.900 --> 03:39.260]  We begged him.
[03:39.260 --> 03:39.540]  Right?
[03:39.880 --> 03:40.560]  We begged him.
[03:40.780 --> 03:44.080]  And Gavin is the most technically adept of all of us.
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.000]  Especially after Mario Party March today.
[03:48.500 --> 03:51.720]  And how long we had to spend on Andrew's god damn computer.
[03:54.260 --> 04:02.660]  It's been weird too because Andrew's computer has gotten progressively worse every day for about 4 days.
[04:03.420 --> 04:04.940]  I thought yesterday was the worst.
[04:05.100 --> 04:07.060]  But today, he just wasn't there.
[04:07.580 --> 04:08.300]  Just wasn't working.
[04:08.720 --> 04:10.300]  Things are just getting worse every day.
[04:10.440 --> 04:11.900]  And then for Gavin on top of it.
[04:11.900 --> 04:19.060]  I still think it's crazy that you reformatted it in the middle of the week on day 21 of Mario Party.
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.140]  Because my computer kept bluescreening constantly.
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.720]  Test, test, test.
[04:24.680 --> 04:26.700]  Hey look, he's back.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.600]  Sounds fine.
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.120]  It crashed for a completely different problem.
[04:37.640 --> 04:38.680]  Oh, what was your problem?
[04:38.680 --> 04:43.440]  It said there's too much shit open on my computer so it dropped out.
[04:43.580 --> 04:46.260]  And there's nothing else open apart from Discord and Audacity.
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.660]  Could it be the million of files that you have saved?
[04:49.740 --> 04:50.940]  All the files you keep?
[04:51.080 --> 04:52.700]  All the things you like to store?
[04:53.260 --> 04:54.700]  You think I store them on my computer?
[04:55.380 --> 04:57.040]  Oh, you're storing them somewhere.
[04:57.640 --> 04:59.120]  Yeah, on different drives.
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.140]  Okay.
[05:01.400 --> 05:06.000]  You're storing them... I know you got them just squirreled away, man.
[05:06.120 --> 05:06.540]  I do!
[05:07.060 --> 05:08.440]  Gavin's a big file guy.
[05:08.440 --> 05:10.880]  He loves storing them files.
[05:11.140 --> 05:14.260]  Well, here's a secret. You should also be a big file guy.
[05:14.600 --> 05:16.200]  Nah, don't need it.
[05:16.220 --> 05:17.500]  You should also have all the files you've made.
[05:18.100 --> 05:18.980]  Don't need it.
[05:19.020 --> 05:21.980]  We literally needed it for F*** Face Season 1 and 2.
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.120]  Well, yeah, because the company we worked for got shut down.
[05:26.580 --> 05:28.840]  You think we're gonna get shut down and then start over?
[05:29.060 --> 05:32.340]  If we get shut down, there's no starting over at this point.
[05:32.360 --> 05:34.520]  What's it got to do with getting shut down? They were your files!
[05:35.080 --> 05:37.420]  Because we lost the things.
[05:37.980 --> 05:39.940]  We lost the ability. We had to make a new feed.
[05:40.080 --> 05:41.740]  So we needed these files.
[05:41.900 --> 05:43.540]  We're not gonna need a new feed again.
[05:43.800 --> 05:44.760]  Don't need the files.
[05:45.980 --> 05:47.680]  The files were on my computer.
[05:48.160 --> 05:53.040]  Okay, what's the difference between this and you not wanting to do a f***ing 5 count at the end?
[05:53.140 --> 05:54.360]  It's the same logic.
[05:54.760 --> 05:57.260]  It's a case of an insane scenario.
[05:58.460 --> 05:59.740]  One serves no purpose whatsoever.
[06:00.180 --> 06:01.860]  Yours serves no purpose whatsoever!
[06:02.000 --> 06:04.060]  If we lose this, we're done!
[06:05.100 --> 06:10.520]  Why is it when we stop recording, don't we spin around three times in our chair and do a little fart?
[06:10.680 --> 06:13.660]  Because it's pointless. It doesn't help the process in any way.
[06:14.220 --> 06:19.920]  You say that, but if that was a file, you would back that f***ing thing up until the end of time.
[06:19.940 --> 06:22.520]  What do you mean if it was a file? What does that even mean if it was a file?
[06:22.600 --> 06:29.300]  If it was a file, if it was something you could save, if it was something that was saveable, you would save that shit until D-Day.
[06:29.600 --> 06:31.840]  Or T-Day. Or whenever the Terminators come.
[06:31.840 --> 06:34.340]  It's not D-Day. D-Day was a different thing.
[06:34.980 --> 06:36.280]  When would... E-Day!
[06:37.080 --> 06:39.040]  That gear's a war! God damn it!
[06:40.160 --> 06:42.520]  One of the days that has a letter in it!
[06:42.820 --> 06:45.940]  While we're arguing... I need to think again at the end, Nick, by the way.
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.100]  While we're arguing...
[06:48.060 --> 06:53.180]  The whole Worms debate of how I knew it was a six-player game...
[06:53.180 --> 06:54.020]  Uh-huh.
[06:55.380 --> 06:55.960]  Go ahead.
[06:57.260 --> 06:59.080]  Was that a serious argument?
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.480]  Of course it was!
[07:00.480 --> 07:01.680]  What do you mean?
[07:02.140 --> 07:05.300]  Calm down. You don't understand the argument.
[07:05.760 --> 07:11.620]  The argument was that it's wild that you never brought up in a scenario in which we were sitting people out that we could all play.
[07:12.300 --> 07:15.940]  Not that... I think we take responsibility for not knowing.
[07:16.420 --> 07:17.540]  We should have known then.
[07:18.040 --> 07:22.620]  But it is wild that you never articulated that at any point.
[07:22.620 --> 07:23.060]  Correct. And I'll tell you why.
[07:23.380 --> 07:23.780]  No it isn't.
[07:23.780 --> 07:29.440]  The first time when we started, when we took over the Let's Play channel, right?
[07:30.260 --> 07:33.000]  It was Geoff, Andrew, Gavin doing stuff.
[07:34.640 --> 07:38.100]  We needed a fourth just to get someone in for Worms.
[07:38.240 --> 07:40.720]  And then Nick and Gracie didn't play.
[07:41.460 --> 07:41.800]  Why not?
[07:43.180 --> 07:44.900]  Didn't need that many people.
[07:45.720 --> 07:46.460]  I don't...
[07:46.460 --> 07:48.200]  What? Hang on. Wait, wait, wait.
[07:48.560 --> 07:50.880]  Are you saying that Nick was not part of...
[07:50.880 --> 07:53.400]  Andrew, Andrew, I want Gavin to keep going.
[07:53.400 --> 07:57.060]  I need to know what comes next and what the fuck he's talking about.
[07:57.060 --> 07:58.500]  We didn't sit someone out.
[07:58.780 --> 08:01.380]  We needed someone to step in for the fourth.
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.160]  That's not true. Nick was part of it from the beginning.
[08:03.500 --> 08:04.640]  Eric was part of it from the beginning.
[08:05.580 --> 08:09.020]  There's a video, just Nick and I doing Texas Chainsaw Massacre together.
[08:09.220 --> 08:09.780]  Just him and I.
[08:10.720 --> 08:13.600]  The first video of the new channel was Worms.
[08:14.080 --> 08:18.220]  Well, the first video of the new channel was a Halo 2 thing that you and I did that you never put out.
[08:19.540 --> 08:20.600]  That wasn't the first video.
[08:21.300 --> 08:23.340]  The whole point is it started us...
[08:23.340 --> 08:24.560]  It started us, the three of us...
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.840]  It was one of the first recorded ones.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.080]  It started us, the three of us playing Worms.
[08:28.140 --> 08:29.920]  We needed four because three is slightly too many.
[08:30.420 --> 08:32.640]  Eric stepped in. Nick was fine sitting out.
[08:32.820 --> 08:34.300]  Gracie was fine sitting out, right?
[08:35.340 --> 08:37.520]  The next game of Worms, I wasn't there.
[08:37.920 --> 08:38.860]  So it was everyone else.
[08:39.240 --> 08:39.680]  Four again.
[08:41.200 --> 08:42.000]  They're definitely...
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.220]  Geoff knew that there were five people in Worms because he's been in a five-player Worms.
[08:46.260 --> 08:50.300]  So, there's no proof that I have actually been in a five-player Worms.
[08:50.300 --> 08:53.660]  The five-player Worms that keeps getting brought up was Trevor on my account.
[08:53.800 --> 08:54.960]  That's been debunked clearly.
[08:54.980 --> 08:57.520]  There was a six-player Worms that Trevor was on your account.
[08:57.620 --> 09:02.200]  There was a five-player Worms where we were showing Fiona Worms.
[09:02.200 --> 09:03.940]  Okay, well, you know what?
[09:04.020 --> 09:10.480]  I'll concede that I may have at one point in my life played one five-player game of Worms
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.260]  across the hundred thousand hours of video games that I played professionally,
[09:15.560 --> 09:20.060]  sometimes six to, I don't know, ten hours a day, five to six days a week for...
[09:20.060 --> 09:21.840]  Oh, about two decades.
[09:23.160 --> 09:27.020]  And then I left about four or five years before you did,
[09:27.100 --> 09:30.100]  and you continued to be in multiple six-player Worms videos.
[09:30.400 --> 09:32.260]  But that's not even really what I want to talk about.
[09:32.320 --> 09:35.260]  What I wanted to step in and say, I think this is a...
[09:35.260 --> 09:41.340]  Guys, if everybody takes a step back, take a 10,000-foot view of what just happened,
[09:41.800 --> 09:46.960]  this was a superb act of deflection and gaslighting by Gavin
[09:46.960 --> 09:52.580]  to take us so far down the road, so far off the path of the original issue,
[09:52.760 --> 09:56.240]  which is that Gavin refused to fix his fucking computer problem
[09:56.240 --> 09:58.060]  before we started recording.
[09:58.420 --> 10:02.460]  And we begged, we literally on, and you're going to hear it because we recorded it,
[10:02.600 --> 10:05.180]  begged him to do it. Then his computer crashed.
[10:05.280 --> 10:08.980]  Then, in the height of Gavin being at the wrongest of the wrong,
[10:09.200 --> 10:14.820]  he somehow flipped the script and is arguing a Worms issue from five fucking videos ago.
[10:14.820 --> 10:18.360]  Oh, I just figured while we were arguing, I would argue about the thing I wanted to argue about.
[10:18.660 --> 10:21.940]  We could go back to me and my computer if you want, but just know this.
[10:24.440 --> 10:29.400]  At no point in any of the videos I was in were we scrambling to fit a fifth person in.
[10:30.160 --> 10:34.300]  The only thing that's interesting is Gavin likes to keep every file, but he doesn't like to upload them.
[10:34.840 --> 10:36.040]  That's what I think is interesting.
[10:36.500 --> 10:36.900]  Yeah?
[10:37.840 --> 10:41.460]  Oh, because I uploaded all my Mario Party files this week,
[10:41.460 --> 10:49.120]  but you uploaded an audio file that was just the game music instead of your voice.
[10:49.360 --> 10:50.280]  I did? Today?
[10:51.340 --> 10:52.160]  What was that about?
[10:52.260 --> 10:54.900]  Today? I don't even know what you're talking about.
[10:55.020 --> 10:57.880]  Didn't we have to use Craig a few turns ago?
[10:58.260 --> 11:01.520]  Oh yeah, but that's because my computer is failing, as we established.
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.620]  I feel like what we can really point at and look at here is that all of the problems are Andrew and Gavin
[11:11.620 --> 11:15.980]  and Nick and Eric and I are sitting back with our feet up, clean as can be.
[11:16.180 --> 11:20.760]  Yeah, I got no problem not being the problem. That's never been an issue for me.
[11:21.060 --> 11:25.020]  We had to mute you in a video this week because your mixer wasn't working.
[11:25.620 --> 11:27.760]  Oh, that is true.
[11:29.460 --> 11:30.620]  You turned into a robot.
[11:30.660 --> 11:31.500]  There you go. That's true.
[11:31.500 --> 11:37.580]  So far, Mario Party March has been the third time I've ever been late to anything for this entire company
[11:37.580 --> 11:39.400]  and the first time I've had an audio issue.
[11:39.680 --> 11:41.220]  So, you know, there you have it.
[11:41.440 --> 11:43.560]  Also, Eric, you're not the only one who's been late.
[11:43.740 --> 11:45.440]  Nick is... Eric? What? Who?
[11:45.760 --> 11:46.760]  Gavin? What? Geoff?
[11:47.140 --> 11:48.040]  I was late.
[11:48.160 --> 11:53.420]  I was late and also Andrew was late, so you're in good company.
[11:53.560 --> 11:58.180]  I've seen people fumble their way through names before getting to the correct one, but never for their own names.
[11:58.240 --> 12:00.400]  That was Geoff. Whoa, dude.
[12:00.400 --> 12:02.860]  I couldn't get to Andrew, so I had to go to me.
[12:04.100 --> 12:08.540]  Geoff was so busy pointing fingers everywhere else, they couldn't get him to come back around.
[12:12.380 --> 12:13.720]  I can be done arguing.
[12:14.800 --> 12:15.400]  Yeah, I'm good.
[12:16.680 --> 12:19.300]  How do I know if I'm gatekeeping information?
[12:22.580 --> 12:25.960]  Because all of the things that I know are the things that I know.
[12:26.080 --> 12:27.920]  How do I know what you don't know?
[12:28.580 --> 12:29.080]  Ask us?
[12:29.500 --> 12:34.280]  You were in videos, you've been in content with worms in which we sat people out.
[12:34.440 --> 12:35.580]  And you didn't...
[12:35.580 --> 12:36.560]  The first one!
[12:36.580 --> 12:39.800]  The first one wasn't sitting anyone out, it was bringing in a fourth.
[12:40.100 --> 12:40.680]  No, no, no, no, no.
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.600]  You talked about how Nick and Gracie sat out.
[12:45.100 --> 12:45.900]  You said those words.
[12:46.300 --> 12:47.900]  You were also sitting out.
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.800]  You were sitting out too until we said we need a fourth and you said, I'll do it.
[12:52.400 --> 12:53.040]  We could have had a sixth.
[12:54.540 --> 12:55.180]  We could have.
[12:55.560 --> 12:58.680]  Were we going to put Gracie in worms? She never played it.
[12:59.860 --> 13:00.760]  Neither did Eric.
[13:00.900 --> 13:02.500]  I had never played worms.
[13:03.080 --> 13:03.680]  Neither had I.
[13:03.800 --> 13:04.780]  Nick had never played it.
[13:05.120 --> 13:06.740]  Well, I think that was the argument. No one's played it.
[13:06.800 --> 13:08.740]  So we just needed one person to step up.
[13:08.760 --> 13:09.580]  What argument are you making?
[13:11.060 --> 13:14.080]  The argument was we weren't trying to squeeze six in.
[13:14.140 --> 13:15.580]  We were trying to get four.
[13:16.220 --> 13:18.240]  Geoff, what is he deflecting from now?
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.520]  I don't know, man.
[13:19.700 --> 13:24.780]  This is like in the old days when Sal the stockbroker would call two Chinese food restaurants
[13:24.780 --> 13:27.500]  and have them talk on the phone and try to place orders with each other.
[13:27.500 --> 13:30.940]  And you just can't follow the logic of what's being said.
[13:31.120 --> 13:31.880]  I have no idea.
[13:31.960 --> 13:35.040]  I feel like Gavin's arguing against himself and for himself at the same time.
[13:35.100 --> 13:37.160]  How am I supposed to know what you don't know?
[13:37.620 --> 13:39.500]  That's my overall point.
[13:40.340 --> 13:46.980]  My point is that it's just you've been in videos in which we reduce the four where we didn't need to.
[13:47.400 --> 13:51.560]  When we started regulation, the regulation, I think the first worm stuff we did...
[13:51.560 --> 13:52.000]  Nick, can you say the first one?
[13:52.380 --> 13:54.640]  That we didn't do that in the first one.
[13:55.280 --> 13:56.920]  You're talking Let's Play.
[13:57.440 --> 13:59.700]  I'm talking when we started regulation gameplay.
[14:03.520 --> 14:06.000]  He said okay so fast.
[14:06.740 --> 14:09.540]  This is like talking to Nick at 100% eat.
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.140]  This is insane.
[14:11.620 --> 14:12.720]  I'm pretty sure.
[14:13.160 --> 14:17.000]  And I haven't gone back and checked because this was almost a year ago.
[14:17.260 --> 14:21.460]  But when we're recording the first worms content for this channel,
[14:21.600 --> 14:23.900]  I'm pretty sure we only had four people
[14:23.900 --> 14:28.400]  and we had one person swap out based on who died.
[14:28.580 --> 14:30.900]  There was definitely a system we made where it was either
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.160]  whoever was in last or whoever won had to swap out
[14:35.160 --> 14:36.320]  and you were in those videos.
[14:37.060 --> 14:40.320]  And it's odd that you never vocalized it then
[14:40.320 --> 14:42.220]  because you like to vocalize things.
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.660]  And I'm not saying that's a bad thing.
[14:43.840 --> 14:44.680]  It could be very helpful.
[14:45.340 --> 14:46.520]  It's a very good thing.
[14:46.720 --> 14:49.280]  When you provide me that video...
[14:49.280 --> 14:51.620]  No, I don't need to because I'm not the fucking...
[14:51.620 --> 14:53.300]  You need to prove your innocence.
[14:54.100 --> 14:55.820]  I'm not taking you to court.
[14:57.340 --> 14:58.540]  That's what we do on this show.
[14:58.660 --> 15:00.280]  The first thing we did was take each other to court.
[15:00.300 --> 15:05.220]  You seem to have loved to have gone through every inch of this fucking case
[15:05.220 --> 15:09.900]  outside of now where I've given you an area in which you could be wrong
[15:09.900 --> 15:11.340]  and then you're like, you go dig it up.
[15:11.580 --> 15:12.960]  No, you finish your investigation.
[15:13.960 --> 15:14.960]  But you're the prosecution.
[15:15.620 --> 15:17.040]  I don't care.
[15:17.340 --> 15:18.580]  This is your case.
[15:19.180 --> 15:20.820]  You're the one that's arguing this.
[15:20.820 --> 15:23.240]  I'm willing to say that we should have known.
[15:23.740 --> 15:25.500]  I've always said we should have known.
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.880]  It just was all so crazy that you never articulated it at that point.
[15:31.740 --> 15:32.680]  That's all I'm saying.
[15:34.300 --> 15:36.320]  And if you want, we can...
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.280]  When you save these files, we can review this in 2046.
[15:39.900 --> 15:41.000]  If you want to go back.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.280]  Well, that'll be our...
[15:42.280 --> 15:45.260]  That's after we bankrupt twice and we have to review this again.
[15:46.060 --> 15:49.580]  What would be the new name for Regulation Podcast if we bankrupt?
[15:49.580 --> 15:51.080]  Third time's a charm.
[15:52.180 --> 15:54.760]  I like third time's a charm a lot.
[15:54.940 --> 15:56.560]  That's a great name on the fly.
[15:58.060 --> 15:58.900]  Well, there you go.
[15:59.020 --> 16:00.840]  Let's fail here so we can succeed there.
[16:01.280 --> 16:02.020]  It's perfect.
[16:03.080 --> 16:05.860]  It's so awesome when these arguments happen.
[16:05.960 --> 16:07.240]  And again, I posted a slider.
[16:07.420 --> 16:09.120]  I'm at a 10. This episode's a 10 for me.
[16:09.180 --> 16:09.940]  I love it.
[16:10.100 --> 16:14.220]  This is Sal asking if he can stay the night at Howard's house.
[16:14.340 --> 16:15.100]  Good to me.
[16:16.520 --> 16:18.620]  To me, these arguments are all timers.
[16:18.620 --> 16:19.840]  I'm having a great time.
[16:19.980 --> 16:20.740]  I love this.
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.120]  I bet you after Meg listens to this one, she'll be on my side.
[16:23.500 --> 16:32.960]  What I love about this, though, is when Gavin asks a question, he's presented with the answer, and then he says yeah or okay.
[16:33.560 --> 16:36.700]  And then the argument keeps going.
[16:38.240 --> 16:40.020]  I just don't think I'm right.
[16:40.240 --> 16:40.280]  It's incredible.
[16:40.560 --> 16:45.380]  And for those who aren't on our gameplay stuff, this all came from playing a game of Worms.
[16:45.420 --> 16:46.340]  One person was sitting out.
[16:46.340 --> 16:47.780]  I said, everyone can play it.
[16:47.820 --> 16:48.560]  It's a five player game.
[16:48.820 --> 16:51.060]  And I got yelled at for about 20 minutes.
[16:51.460 --> 16:52.480]  Just because we didn't know.
[16:52.800 --> 16:56.440]  You got yelled at way more now.
[16:57.080 --> 16:59.900]  Or if you would have just opened your fucking mouth 40 years ago.
[16:59.980 --> 17:00.560]  Yep, that's it.
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.300]  I opened my mouth the first time I thought to open my mouth.
[17:04.760 --> 17:06.320]  Well, think better and faster.
[17:06.820 --> 17:11.560]  No, I think the argument is that it is wild that that was the first time in which you felt.
[17:12.300 --> 17:13.080]  Because we should have known.
[17:13.180 --> 17:13.540]  You're right.
[17:13.540 --> 17:16.040]  I agree with that aspect of it.
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.240]  We're all at fault.
[17:17.800 --> 17:25.060]  Apparently in my 40, almost 50 years of life, there was about a 27 minute window where I was aware of this too.
[17:25.180 --> 17:26.740]  I should have definitely remembered that.
[17:27.180 --> 17:30.920]  Geoff forgot that we were doing Mario Party March on date 19.
[17:30.920 --> 17:32.900]  He was at his computer.
[17:33.100 --> 17:34.340]  I was editing so long, right?
[17:34.880 --> 17:36.440]  And Gavin texted me.
[17:37.360 --> 17:41.420]  Oh yeah, because we were all sitting in there going, is Geoff okay? Where's Geoff?
[17:41.420 --> 17:43.380]  I text Geoff the word, where?
[17:43.700 --> 17:45.560]  And he replied, where what?
[17:45.880 --> 17:47.560]  And I replied, where you?
[17:53.400 --> 17:54.720]  And opened a different window.
[17:54.840 --> 17:57.540]  Mario Party March has been crazy.
[17:57.860 --> 17:59.560]  It has been so much fun.
[17:59.960 --> 18:02.780]  It's also been the worst because I'm so sick of waking up.
[18:02.860 --> 18:03.660]  It's been brutal.
[18:04.180 --> 18:06.940]  There's no break or relief.
[18:07.100 --> 18:08.280]  And it's constant.
[18:10.360 --> 18:15.180]  But when it goes against you, and boy has it gone against me.
[18:15.740 --> 18:17.320]  And has it gone against other people.
[18:18.220 --> 18:20.880]  You just spend all day thinking about it.
[18:21.440 --> 18:22.120]  Nick, is that true?
[18:22.660 --> 18:23.940]  I think about it from time to time.
[18:24.540 --> 18:26.320]  Like it just, you dwell on it.
[18:26.420 --> 18:31.900]  Because you can't, you know, if something bad happens typically in a Mario Party game, you just go on to the next turn.
[18:31.980 --> 18:35.060]  And you can immediately start work on digging out of that hole.
[18:35.060 --> 18:42.240]  But if you fuck up, and because we're doing it so early every morning, it's just your whole day.
[18:42.280 --> 18:44.860]  It's all you can think about.
[18:45.340 --> 18:47.940]  It's been such a fun way to play that game.
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.520]  That I also never want to do again, at least at that hour.
[18:53.100 --> 18:55.080]  No, no, we have to figure something else out.
[18:55.160 --> 19:01.780]  But at the same time, like, I just don't trust us throughout the day to like not have other things scheduled and whatever.
[19:01.780 --> 19:09.540]  But man, that early recording slot, what a jump start to your day.
[19:10.980 --> 19:12.060]  Like, wow.
[19:12.860 --> 19:15.380]  You're just going now. It's crazy.
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.140]  You guys don't like the idea I presented the other day where next year we do this again, but we do it twice, 9am and 9pm.
[19:22.560 --> 19:24.540]  Concurrent games running at the same time.
[19:24.680 --> 19:24.960]  No.
[19:25.700 --> 19:26.760]  Just double down.
[19:27.380 --> 19:29.520]  I really like the 9pm one.
[19:30.480 --> 19:32.080]  I'll sign up for that instantly.
[19:32.280 --> 19:36.480]  I told my wife that this morning and she said, that's too easy. You should have to do it at noon and midnight.
[19:36.620 --> 19:38.340]  And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[19:38.340 --> 19:39.660]  I'm okay with that one too.
[19:40.060 --> 19:41.580]  You mean that one? Noon and midnight?
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.920]  You want to do one at...
[19:43.920 --> 19:44.240]  Okay.
[19:46.020 --> 19:48.040]  Hey, are you okay? Hey, Gavin, you okay, man?
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.500]  Well, I'm just trying to think of the time we did a podcast at the beginning of the end of the day.
[19:51.540 --> 19:52.720]  It was awful, wasn't it?
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.640]  It sucked.
[19:54.860 --> 19:56.320]  It sucked ass.
[19:56.320 --> 20:01.840]  It sounded like Gavin was about to share information and then thought better of it because he didn't want to get in trouble for sharing it.
[20:05.380 --> 20:07.820]  Oh, Christ.
[20:09.840 --> 20:12.280]  Thanks to Bear Mattress for supporting Regulation Podcast.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.260]  Look, sleep is an important thing, right?

[20:17.580 --> 20:20.340]  The first thing you're asking people, oh, how do you sleep? How do you sleep?
[20:20.340 --> 20:28.900]  I sleep great because with Bear Mattress, it helped me eliminate my problems at night with night sweats and back pain and hip pain and things like that.

[21:36.280 --> 21:42.410]  Of all these mattresses I've ever had, this is the easiest setup I've ever had for a mattress.
[21:43.080 --> 21:44.360]  I cannot recommend it enough.

[22:09.920 --> 22:17.020]  Hey, speaking of information, so we are doing back-to-backs today, which, I'll be honest, stressed me out yesterday because I was looking at my notes,
[22:17.100 --> 22:21.420]  and I just have a section of dregs that I've just been pushing off that's all I've got.
[22:21.620 --> 22:23.080]  Like, four little dreg notes.
[22:23.560 --> 22:27.840]  And I thought, that could be my contribution to one episode, but I need to come up with some new ideas or something.
[22:28.260 --> 22:31.720]  I was laying in bed, just racking my brain. I couldn't think of anything, so I went to bed.
[22:32.160 --> 22:36.840]  And then the idea fairy came and visited me in my sleep.
[22:36.900 --> 22:40.080]  And when I woke up this morning, I was vomiting ideas.
[22:40.200 --> 22:44.880]  I had five ideas at the same fucking time all at once this morning.
[22:45.120 --> 22:48.000]  Wow. To share with you guys. Like a freestyle machine of ideas.
[22:48.220 --> 22:53.180]  It was like a little machine gun, but it only had five bullets in it, but the succession was rapid.
[22:53.320 --> 22:55.840]  It was like, da-da-da-da, even faster than that, maybe.
[22:56.360 --> 22:58.460]  Do they build, or are they all completely unique?
[22:58.460 --> 23:01.660]  I'm gonna let, oh, I think they're, well, you'll see. Can I share them with you guys?
[23:01.740 --> 23:02.160]  Yeah, of course.
[23:02.720 --> 23:05.860]  Alright, my first idea. You guys know dartboards, right?
[23:06.120 --> 23:06.760]  Yup. Yes.
[23:06.860 --> 23:13.360]  You have a dartboard, it's round, you play the game where you try to get the dart in the middle or strategically around the edges.
[23:13.640 --> 23:18.040]  There's games called cricket, there's just like, but they're dartboard games, right?
[23:18.540 --> 23:21.420]  Why don't we have dartboard games?
[23:21.860 --> 23:25.720]  Why does a dart, why does a dartboard have to be just a circular thing on a wall?
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.080]  Why can't it be much larger?
[23:27.360 --> 23:33.000]  Why can't it be like Candyland, and you're throwing darts to go places on the board, and then you end up being like,
[23:33.040 --> 23:36.920]  oh, I missed, I'm in the fucking, I'm in the swamp, I gotta go back three darts, or whatever.
[23:37.320 --> 23:41.080]  Why do we, why can't we innovate on the dartboard itself?
[23:41.420 --> 23:48.460]  If people can put pickleball courts in their backyard, if they can build, like, fucking rock climbing walls in their garage,
[23:48.540 --> 23:55.020]  why can't you dedicate a wall in your garage to a dartboard that's wall size that you can create entire board games on?
[23:55.020 --> 24:00.260]  I think we can revolutionize the dartboard industry and dartboards, darts as a sport in general.
[24:00.740 --> 24:08.240]  I mean, you got a few dart things, you got lawn darts, you got the dartboard, you got the throwing balloons,
[24:08.800 --> 24:11.300]  or no, you throw the darts, not the balloons.
[24:11.680 --> 24:16.280]  Now, what about that? What if you had to throw the balloons at the darts?
[24:16.860 --> 24:18.180]  I'm okay with that idea, too.
[24:18.260 --> 24:24.160]  I just think that we, we did that thing as a culture and a society where we built a dartboard and we went,
[24:24.160 --> 24:27.960]  good enough, and then nobody thought to innovate. And it's just been sitting there.
[24:28.360 --> 24:32.100]  They've just been sitting there collecting dust in every garage in the world.
[24:33.300 --> 24:37.960]  Across the universe, people are ignoring dartboards, but they didn't, they don't have to.
[24:38.060 --> 24:43.200]  If we made them a fun shape and added new mechanics to the game, think about it.
[24:43.320 --> 24:43.960]  That's my first idea.
[24:44.180 --> 24:50.920]  We don't even need to add new mechanics. We can just say it has AI in it, because that's what every major company is doing now.
[24:50.920 --> 24:56.120]  AI dartboard, dartboard 2.0. What does the AI do? I don't know.
[24:56.200 --> 25:03.580]  I don't understand why every company is fighting so hard after something that I don't know anyone who cares about.
[25:04.020 --> 25:07.920]  Yes. That's got an AI. Look at that. AI.
[25:08.420 --> 25:10.420]  I'm sure people use that. Just who are those people?
[25:11.120 --> 25:16.440]  I can think of a couple of people I know personally that are fucking in love with it. Talk about it constantly.
[25:17.220 --> 25:18.100]  You know one of them?
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.820]  Having AI and stuff?
[25:19.820 --> 25:21.440]  Yeah, and using AI for stuff.
[25:21.800 --> 25:26.540]  Even to this day, you look at stuff like Siri, which is I assume over a decade old.
[25:26.860 --> 25:31.660]  I've never used it for anything other than setting a timer, so maybe I'm not the best use case for AI.
[25:31.960 --> 25:36.360]  I finally used Alexa the way you're supposed to the other day, I think.
[25:36.440 --> 25:40.880]  I usually just ask her what the weather is, and sometimes I'll ask her to play a song.
[25:40.880 --> 25:49.740]  But yesterday, I realized I needed to descale my coffee maker, and I couldn't find the descaler since I moved.
[25:49.820 --> 25:51.700]  It's like one of those things you use twice a year, you know?
[25:52.100 --> 25:52.260]  Yeah.
[25:52.300 --> 25:54.220]  And so I thought, it's like six bucks, I'll just buy more.
[25:54.360 --> 25:58.620]  And I looked at my Alexa and I thought, I bet I could just tell this lady to buy it and she'll buy it.
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.480]  And I did, and she did.
[26:01.340 --> 26:02.620]  I just said, Alexa.
[26:03.040 --> 26:04.260]  Well, she's in the downstairs.
[26:04.260 --> 26:07.380]  I said, Alexa, buy descaler, coffee descaler.
[26:07.460 --> 26:11.300]  And she goes, you purchased this on October 7th, 2023, would you like to purchase it again?
[26:11.340 --> 26:11.880]  And I was like, yes.
[26:11.900 --> 26:13.620]  And then she's like, ordered, it will be here Friday.
[26:14.440 --> 26:16.360]  And I was like, why haven't I been doing this for years?
[26:16.380 --> 26:18.780]  I've had this lady in my house for like fucking six years now.
[26:20.140 --> 26:20.920]  Well, you prayed to her.
[26:21.200 --> 26:22.460]  That's true, I did pray to her that time.
[26:23.260 --> 26:25.080]  Anyway, so that was my first idea.
[26:25.680 --> 26:27.640]  Now I have four more ideas I'd like to share with you.
[26:27.820 --> 26:28.980]  Here's my second idea.
[26:29.580 --> 26:30.220]  Hot spoon.
[26:30.780 --> 26:31.500]  Think about it.
[26:31.500 --> 26:37.400]  An electric spoon that also heats your food up while it's heating up on the stove even faster.
[26:37.620 --> 26:38.520]  I thought it might exist.
[26:38.740 --> 26:39.980]  So I have another idea for you.
[26:40.360 --> 26:41.260]  Cold spoon.
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.680]  A spoon that cools things down electrically.
[26:45.660 --> 26:48.840]  Say your soup's too hot and you're like, oh, it's too hot and you gotta blow on it.
[26:49.020 --> 26:49.540]  Cold spoon.
[26:50.880 --> 26:55.980]  A decently cool spoon that you put it in that just cools things down so you don't have to blow on them.
[26:56.200 --> 26:59.560]  Or just slightly warms it up if your soup's a little too cold.
[26:59.560 --> 27:04.840]  I mean, could that be done with just like a hollow spoon full of a cooling liquid that you just keep in the freezer?
[27:05.260 --> 27:09.060]  Yeah, in my mind it's done somehow with watch batteries and electronics.
[27:09.220 --> 27:10.580]  But yeah, it could probably be done that way too.
[27:11.120 --> 27:13.680]  I'm gonna take a step back and say I don't know if it's the hot spoon.
[27:13.780 --> 27:19.720]  I think what I was thinking of is they made a spoon that makes things taste salty.
[27:20.400 --> 27:22.820]  It adds a sodium taste to...
[27:22.820 --> 27:23.320]  A salt spoon?
[27:23.500 --> 27:26.300]  Is hot and salt the same to you?
[27:26.540 --> 27:29.160]  No, but I think I just went innovative spoon.
[27:29.160 --> 27:31.160]  But I'm trying to...
[27:31.720 --> 27:33.780]  Was it just me?
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.820]  No, my brain went technology spoon and I immediately went salt.
[27:38.080 --> 27:45.460]  Well, now I'm trying to remember if adding like a salt taste was a side function of the hot spoon.
[27:45.820 --> 27:47.440]  It was at CES this year.
[27:47.700 --> 27:48.860]  What was the spoon?
[27:48.980 --> 27:53.780]  So I invented something this morning that's already at CES this year. I'm like six months too late.
[27:54.180 --> 27:55.100]  That's so close.
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.020]  But it sounds like they didn't bring a cold spoon out.
[27:58.020 --> 28:00.380]  Salt spoon? CES spoon?
[28:01.280 --> 28:02.720]  Electric salt spoon.
[28:03.540 --> 28:05.020]  Electric salt spoon.
[28:05.180 --> 28:11.840]  Is a tableware type device that enhances the salty and umami taste of low-sodium foods with the power of electricity.
[28:12.780 --> 28:17.780]  A weak electric current is passed from the tip of the spoon to the food to enhance the taste of the meal.
[28:18.400 --> 28:20.900]  See, if it heated or cooled it, we'd be on to something.
[28:21.340 --> 28:24.520]  But that's the type of spoon you want, Geoff, like visually, right?
[28:24.600 --> 28:25.700]  Like you want a tech spoon.
[28:25.700 --> 28:26.680]  Yeah, like that, yeah.
[28:27.100 --> 28:29.460]  Does electrocuting your food make it taste more salty?
[28:30.040 --> 28:30.400]  Apparently.
[28:30.900 --> 28:31.620]  I guess so.
[28:31.780 --> 28:33.260]  Why don't we just have electric plates?
[28:33.520 --> 28:40.620]  Yeah, what if it's too electrified? Do you think it would like, it would zap you and be, but like you wouldn't get hurt, it would just be too salty?
[28:40.780 --> 28:41.420]  Ooh, too salty.
[28:42.980 --> 28:46.000]  I want food that when I lift it off the plate, there's a small arc.
[28:50.140 --> 28:50.500]  Tangy.
[28:50.840 --> 28:54.300]  What if it's like when you electrocute a pond in a video game?
[28:57.200 --> 29:00.120]  What if there was a condiment fork?
[29:01.540 --> 29:09.440]  So imagine a ketchup in a fork, you can stab a couple of chip, a couple of fries, little squirt of ketchup comes out of the fork.
[29:09.720 --> 29:16.540]  Yeah, what if at the end you can squeeze like the tip, you like push on the tip and it squeezes a little at the front right as it goes in your mouth.
[29:16.880 --> 29:18.100]  So you get like the perfect amount.
[29:18.680 --> 29:22.980]  And that way there's no soggy factor because you're putting ketchup on the chips right at the last minute.
[29:23.380 --> 29:24.180]  I like this.
[29:24.660 --> 29:25.300]  That's interesting.
[29:25.300 --> 29:27.200]  Maybe we should get into the silverware lab.
[29:27.720 --> 29:29.280]  Yeah, it sounds like we really should.
[29:29.800 --> 29:31.760]  We made forks before.
[29:32.740 --> 29:34.260]  That's true, we made some pretty awesome forks.
[29:34.340 --> 29:35.940]  I'm not giving up on a hot spoon, cold spoon.
[29:36.140 --> 29:39.720]  And I really like the idea of flavor injectable forks.
[29:41.620 --> 29:47.300]  Do you sell canisters or is it like that fork is what it is and then you have to buy new forks?
[29:47.400 --> 29:50.060]  It should be washable and refillable, I assume.
[29:50.620 --> 29:50.840]  Yeah.
[29:50.840 --> 29:58.680]  Now, unfortunately, UtensilMate has come around and it hasn't.
[29:59.160 --> 30:06.800]  Kickstarter, I just sent an image to the Kickstarter where they were looking for $18,000.
[30:08.700 --> 30:19.220]  Unfortunately, they only reached $2,900 on 54 backers, but this project did not reach its funding goal by August 19th of 2015.
[30:19.220 --> 30:23.420]  So we might be a little behind the times on this one.
[30:23.580 --> 30:30.180]  Maybe it was an idea ahead of its time and it just needed to be reinvented by the right people at the right time.
[30:30.560 --> 30:30.680]  Could be.
[30:30.680 --> 30:32.460]  That looks horrific. That's a terrible picture.
[30:32.720 --> 30:36.480]  It's a really bad mock-up of what that thing would be.
[30:36.980 --> 30:38.600]  Yeah, we could definitely improve upon that.
[30:38.760 --> 30:41.200]  I don't think anything should be visible from the outside like that.
[30:41.320 --> 30:42.460]  I think it could all be done internally.
[30:43.860 --> 30:45.780]  All right, so those are my first three.
[30:46.040 --> 30:50.460]  So far, you got dart board games, you got a hot spoon, you got cold spoon.
[30:50.560 --> 30:53.240]  Are you ready for idea number four? It's a two-parter.
[30:53.320 --> 30:53.640]  Yes.
[30:54.180 --> 30:57.740]  The idea number four, Nick, this idea is specifically for you.
[30:58.060 --> 30:59.860]  I think a lot about where we're going.
[31:00.020 --> 31:04.380]  Andrew mentioned earlier that we're going to go out of business at some point and then form a third time's a charm company.
[31:04.780 --> 31:11.400]  We've got a lot of tumult in our future, but at some point, we will have all accrued enough money and success and age that we can retire.
[31:11.400 --> 31:13.940]  And Nick, I worry about you and your retirement.
[31:14.400 --> 31:15.840]  So here's what I'm going to propose to you.
[31:16.160 --> 31:19.520]  You move to Vermont, huge in the antiquing world in Vermont.
[31:19.740 --> 31:23.720]  You open up your first... this is a franchise idea I've got here.
[31:23.780 --> 31:25.740]  You open up your first antique store.
[31:26.300 --> 31:27.040]  You ready for this?
[31:27.520 --> 31:27.820]  Oh, yeah.
[31:27.840 --> 31:29.460]  You call it the Nick and Cranny.
[31:30.380 --> 31:38.240]  After that's a huge success and everybody buys their antiques from the Nick and Cranny, you go two towns over, you open up your second shop.
[31:38.240 --> 31:43.720]  It's priced a little lower items, you know, a little bit more accessible as now you've made a name for yourself.
[31:43.880 --> 31:49.400]  A lot of people are going to want to come in and buy stuff from the Nick and Cranny, but not everybody's going to be able to afford it.
[31:49.560 --> 31:51.680]  So you're going to be able to send them to Nick's Snacks.
[31:51.980 --> 31:56.160]  That's your second store, your satellite store, where you're going to sell slightly cheaper stuff.
[31:56.580 --> 31:58.980]  That's my fourth idea, the Nick and Cranny and Nick's Snacks.
[31:59.480 --> 32:00.020]  What about that?
[32:00.440 --> 32:01.820]  I like it. I'm in.
[32:02.060 --> 32:05.060]  And here's my fifth and final idea.
[32:05.060 --> 32:18.820]  I was reading something on a subreddit the other day about somebody bitching about how long it took the police to come to their contested fender bender, right?
[32:18.900 --> 32:25.020]  And they were just like, we're just sitting on the side of the road for like an hour and a half waiting for the cops to show up because of this fender bender.
[32:25.180 --> 32:27.700]  And, you know, typically these days you like exchange information and leave.
[32:27.760 --> 32:31.260]  But whenever there's like an issue and people are contesting it, everybody sticks around.
[32:31.260 --> 32:35.340]  And I was thinking about all those people. This happened to my wife in Houston a couple of years ago.
[32:35.760 --> 32:39.900]  Some guy insisted on waiting for the police to come instead of exchanging information.
[32:40.160 --> 32:43.020]  And it was a whole thing. And it took like over an hour of Emily's time.
[32:43.380 --> 32:46.160]  That got me thinking, you know what those people need?
[32:46.520 --> 32:46.960]  What?
[32:47.300 --> 32:48.880]  Those people need comfort food.
[32:49.380 --> 32:59.660]  They need an Uber that's specific for people in fender benders that are stuck on the side of the interstate in some weird mile marker that's hard to explain to an Uber Eats driver.
[33:00.560 --> 33:06.340]  That exists solely to bring food to people stuck in fender benders.
[33:06.360 --> 33:11.000]  We can make it chicken based. We can call it tender bender. And we're going to make a billion dollars.
[33:11.540 --> 33:13.080]  I like tender bender a lot.
[33:13.660 --> 33:14.400]  I like that.
[33:14.440 --> 33:18.980]  Can it be spelled like T-E-N-D-R? B-E-N-D-R?
[33:19.420 --> 33:22.720]  Yeah, this is 2025. We're not going to waste money on vowels.
[33:23.040 --> 33:23.780]  Cool. Good. Thank you.
[33:24.080 --> 33:24.860]  Yeah, no problem.
[33:24.860 --> 33:30.360]  And those are my five ideas that my machine gun ideas that all came to me the second I woke up this morning.
[33:30.440 --> 33:32.340]  And I'm very happy to have shared them all with you.
[33:32.580 --> 33:36.560]  Oh man, I got a 50% off coupon on tender bender. God damn, I got to get into an accident.
[33:37.160 --> 33:37.520]  Shit.
[33:38.380 --> 33:43.180]  It's not one of those things that you look to use, but when you need it, you need it.
[33:43.340 --> 33:45.840]  So are they just driving around listening to the police radio?
[33:46.380 --> 33:48.880]  They could be. Yeah, they could be. I'm open to ideas.
[33:50.220 --> 33:54.020]  I like the idea that that's how they get you to join the app.
[33:54.020 --> 33:59.380]  They show up to your scene and they're like, oh, it's like an ambulance chaser, but they're chicken chasers.
[33:59.480 --> 34:03.760]  And they just chase tender benders with nice hot chicken tenders and nuggets.
[34:04.180 --> 34:09.920]  Maybe if the food truck had a towing capacity on the back, it could be a double whammy.
[34:11.260 --> 34:13.560]  Then they could tow you to the main restaurant.
[34:14.740 --> 34:18.080]  Yeah, what if you get towed into the restaurant?
[34:18.080 --> 34:25.400]  But what if you take a ride up front while your car's being towed and they just forcefully drive you through the tender bender drive through?
[34:26.220 --> 34:34.140]  It could be like a reverse food truck where the people stand facing outward and you're in the middle of it.
[34:34.900 --> 34:36.420]  It's like a drive in food truck.
[34:36.660 --> 34:39.580]  I like the idea of a drive through that is on the passenger side.
[34:41.800 --> 34:52.380]  I wonder if there is a if there exists a mechanic shop or auto body shop or minor repair shop slash sit down restaurant.
[34:53.200 --> 35:03.900]  You go in, you pull in there, you're like, I changed my oil and bang out that fender and I'm going to go in and eat a chicken fried steak and have some iced tea.
[35:04.580 --> 35:05.780]  It's a good combo.
[35:05.780 --> 35:12.460]  I don't. Yeah. Hey, if you work in that environment, let us know. You're the one.
[35:13.780 --> 35:19.320]  If you work in a restaurant or a garage and you think your business could be improved by one or the other, let us know.
[35:19.920 --> 35:24.120]  Would you have to call it something that kind of fit both industries like the oil can or something?
[35:24.820 --> 35:26.420]  How does that fit the food industry?
[35:27.360 --> 35:30.020]  Wait, what? Hold on. What? What do you mean?
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.200]  The oil can. How does that apply to food?
[35:32.660 --> 35:33.460]  You cook food in oil?
[35:34.500 --> 35:37.620]  Okay. Maybe it's if it's the olive oil can.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.300]  Yeah. What do you want from me?
[35:41.320 --> 35:45.340]  You just you said that like it was so established. I was just curious.
[35:45.840 --> 35:48.540]  Name a food that's also used in cars. What do you mean?
[35:49.080 --> 35:54.680]  Uh, what was your idea? Once again, this is for you to prove and not for me to establish.
[35:55.280 --> 35:56.600]  You don't want to do any of the work today.
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.720]  No, there's nuts. You can do something with nuts. You eat nuts. They're corn nuts.
[36:03.820 --> 36:04.940]  Corn nuts!
[36:05.640 --> 36:08.900]  Dude, that's what it is. It's truck nuts. It's truck nuts.
[36:11.680 --> 36:15.040]  We're selling truck nuts, but we're also selling truck nuts.
[36:15.380 --> 36:16.560]  This is awesome.
[36:17.300 --> 36:19.760]  So it would be nut based food. It'd be like a vegetarian place.
[36:20.100 --> 36:25.000]  It's this. It's this but also cashews.
[36:25.640 --> 36:25.820]  Yeah.
[36:30.820 --> 36:32.600]  This episode's fucking crazy.
[36:33.720 --> 36:37.220]  You can just do cashews on the back of trucks. What if it was also literal nuts?
[36:37.920 --> 36:39.740]  Truck nuts that aren't balls.
[36:40.240 --> 36:42.400]  Should we get into designing?
[36:44.260 --> 36:45.840]  What would you call that?
[36:46.280 --> 36:46.760]  The truck nut?
[36:47.300 --> 36:48.980]  Yeah, but like, what would you call that decoration?
[36:49.600 --> 36:54.140]  Like, oh, like, oh, like, it's like a trailer, like a hitch decoration.
[36:54.460 --> 36:55.720]  No, it's like a hitch accessory.
[36:55.720 --> 36:59.220]  Hitch accessory. Should we get into designing like hitch accessories?
[36:59.860 --> 37:00.780]  Like a truck pussy?
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.820]  No, I don't think anyone that listens to this show has a hitch on it.
[37:08.300 --> 37:10.440]  It's not our audience, man.
[37:11.380 --> 37:12.320]  Road flaps.
[37:17.740 --> 37:19.620]  Mudflaps, but evolved.
[37:25.980 --> 37:28.240]  Yeah, when I hear hitch, I think of the Will Smith movie.
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.640]  I feel like there's a lot of people out there with truck hitches that just don't want, you know,
[37:34.140 --> 37:39.000]  giant metal silver balls hanging from their truck, but they want to decorate it in some way.
[37:39.320 --> 37:41.660]  You know, maybe they're less crude.
[37:42.840 --> 37:44.260]  What the hell's that?
[37:45.660 --> 37:48.140]  It's Will Smith after we feed him some truck nuts.
[37:48.160 --> 37:50.880]  That's the cover. That's the thumbnail.
[37:51.720 --> 37:55.480]  Will Smith is allergic to truck nuts.
[38:00.340 --> 38:05.280]  When you search Will Smith hitch, this is the second image that shows up.
[38:05.740 --> 38:06.920]  I've never seen that movie.
[38:07.220 --> 38:08.500]  Me neither.
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.880]  We're going to have to, that's something we're going to have to be careful with is truck nut allergies when we open this restaurant.
[38:14.000 --> 38:14.920]  You got to be really careful.
[38:15.420 --> 38:18.000]  I don't remember that, and I have seen that movie.
[38:18.900 --> 38:19.760]  That's horrific.
[38:19.760 --> 38:25.800]  Dude, when you search Will Smith hitch, that is like the image that shows up over and over and over again.
[38:25.880 --> 38:29.960]  It's just his face all fucked up off our truck nuts.
[38:33.000 --> 38:33.520]  Crazy.
[38:34.260 --> 38:34.780]  Wow.
[38:36.080 --> 38:39.020]  Do you want truck nuts? No, I have a nut allergy.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.140]  That's so stupid.
[38:45.440 --> 38:47.540]  What other truck food are there?
[38:47.780 --> 38:49.620]  There's not wipers or not a food.
[38:50.620 --> 38:51.120]  Glass.
[38:52.480 --> 38:55.160]  Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.
[38:56.960 --> 38:57.460]  Chairs.
[38:59.540 --> 39:00.040]  Chess.
[39:01.120 --> 39:01.620]  Seats.
[39:02.600 --> 39:04.480]  I'm just trying to think what's in the car.
[39:04.600 --> 39:05.100]  Tires.
[39:06.040 --> 39:06.680]  Candy tires.
[39:07.640 --> 39:08.480]  Steering wheel.
[39:09.020 --> 39:10.920]  Steering, yeah, no, that doesn't work.
[39:11.480 --> 39:12.120]  Glove box.
[39:12.880 --> 39:13.480]  Hmm.
[39:14.660 --> 39:15.260]  Hmm.
[39:16.500 --> 39:18.380]  I've exhausted my ideas.
[39:18.640 --> 39:19.240]  Blinker.
[39:20.100 --> 39:22.460]  Blinker? Yeah, there's no candy named Blinker.
[39:22.800 --> 39:23.340]  That I'm aware of.
[39:23.700 --> 39:24.800]  I'm sure there's six in England.
[39:25.380 --> 39:27.860]  It could be. That would be like Blinky Linky.
[39:30.640 --> 39:32.520]  Gavin loves him some Blinky Linkys.
[39:33.240 --> 39:36.500]  I asked Gavin what his...
[39:36.500 --> 39:39.920]  What nationality his taste buds think he is.
[39:40.360 --> 39:42.600]  And I was surprised that he still thinks British.
[39:43.260 --> 39:43.620]  Really?
[39:44.260 --> 39:44.980]  Uh, yeah.
[39:45.440 --> 39:46.640]  I think it's just what I grew up on.
[39:46.900 --> 39:48.600]  And I'll be honest.
[39:48.700 --> 39:51.960]  I think food in America looks better than it tastes.
[39:52.480 --> 39:53.420]  I think that's America.
[39:54.080 --> 39:55.700]  America looks better than it tastes.
[39:55.940 --> 39:57.960]  Yeah, I think that veneer is slowly coming off
[39:57.960 --> 39:59.340]  if you really kind of pay attention.
[40:00.820 --> 40:01.700]  I was surprised.
[40:01.800 --> 40:03.220]  Because you eat American food every day.
[40:03.520 --> 40:05.800]  And you've lived in America quite a while at this point.
[40:06.160 --> 40:07.520]  How long have you lived in America?
[40:08.640 --> 40:09.480]  13 years.
[40:10.120 --> 40:10.540]  Whoa!
[40:12.240 --> 40:14.480]  And you lived in England for 13 years also.
[40:14.680 --> 40:15.640]  So it's sort of even, right?
[40:15.980 --> 40:16.760]  Yeah, 50-50.
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.280]  I just feel like breakfast here looks tremendous.
[40:20.280 --> 40:22.500]  But it's rarely better than an English breakfast.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.380]  I'm not even going to get into this.
[40:25.880 --> 40:27.060]  No, get into it.
[40:27.560 --> 40:27.980]  Get into it.
[40:29.380 --> 40:31.160]  The beans for breakfast thing is
[40:31.160 --> 40:33.580]  just not a line I'm going to cross ever.
[40:33.760 --> 40:34.320]  That's so nuts.
[40:34.320 --> 40:35.780]  Did you do it though? Did you try it?
[40:35.800 --> 40:37.680]  Yes. No, it's not.
[40:38.160 --> 40:39.200]  Did you do it properly?
[40:40.020 --> 40:40.340]  What?
[40:41.680 --> 40:43.980]  Did I have an English breakfast?
[40:44.480 --> 40:45.860]  Yeah, but did you have it properly?
[40:47.080 --> 40:48.300]  Yeah, like did you get a bit of sausage,
[40:48.440 --> 40:50.640]  a bit of bacon, sort of run it around the beans,
[40:50.800 --> 40:52.620]  like get a good combo of everything
[40:52.620 --> 40:53.200]  and every bite?
[40:53.680 --> 40:55.440]  A bit of brown sauce, a bit of daddy's?
[40:56.060 --> 40:56.580]  We're done.
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.320]  Come on, put some daddy's
[41:01.460 --> 41:02.640]  brown sauce in your mouth.
[41:02.640 --> 41:04.160]  The American breakfast
[41:04.160 --> 41:05.980]  sauce game is lacking
[41:05.980 --> 41:08.000]  and the bacon is very weird
[41:08.620 --> 41:09.980]  and the sausage is in a
[41:10.760 --> 41:11.720]  giant patty.
[41:11.940 --> 41:13.660]  Everything about it is slightly off.
[41:13.760 --> 41:15.780]  Well, first off, we have both kinds of patties here.
[41:16.100 --> 41:18.220]  Both kinds of sausage. We have links and patties
[41:18.220 --> 41:19.800]  and we have scrambled sausage.
[41:19.960 --> 41:22.520]  We actually have more sausage variety here.
[41:22.600 --> 41:24.220]  I think that's ridiculous. And to compare
[41:25.440 --> 41:26.400]  crispy American
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.280]  bacon to any other bacon on Earth
[41:28.280 --> 41:30.600]  is an insult. There is no comparison.
[41:30.600 --> 41:32.540]  I agree, there's no comparison.
[41:33.200 --> 41:34.240]  Is good just familiar?
[41:34.960 --> 41:35.840]  Good familiar.
[41:36.140 --> 41:38.760]  Does Gavin think it's good because it's just what he grew up
[41:38.760 --> 41:39.320]  on?
[41:40.260 --> 41:41.780]  No, it tastes delicious.
[41:42.540 --> 41:44.700]  But do you think that because it's familiar?
[41:45.260 --> 41:46.040]  Because of nostalgia?
[41:47.420 --> 41:48.480]  Well, I've had
[41:48.480 --> 41:50.560]  a lot of food that I didn't have
[41:50.560 --> 41:52.440]  before my 20s that I think is also good
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.300]  and it's not familiar.
[41:54.020 --> 41:55.580]  That is a good point.
[41:56.300 --> 41:58.400]  Listen, I think a full English
[41:58.400 --> 41:59.600]  breakfast is delicious.
[41:59.900 --> 42:02.400]  I'm into the tomato, I'm into the beans,
[42:02.480 --> 42:04.260]  the whole thing. But if you compare that to what I would
[42:04.260 --> 42:06.580]  consider to be the quintessential American
[42:06.580 --> 42:08.280]  breakfast, which is two eggs however
[42:08.280 --> 42:10.340]  you like them. I'll take mine over medium, thank you.
[42:11.060 --> 42:12.400]  Toast with butter and
[42:12.400 --> 42:14.380]  jam, hash browns
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.420]  and bacon. I just don't see how
[42:16.420 --> 42:18.240]  it compares. Yeah, I agree.
[42:18.280 --> 42:20.320]  It's lacking. When was the last time
[42:20.320 --> 42:21.760]  you found a favorite food?
[42:22.140 --> 42:24.380]  It's a bulletproof meal. There's no weakness there.
[42:26.040 --> 42:26.440]  Nick,
[42:26.440 --> 42:27.680]  be American.
[42:28.080 --> 42:30.060]  I want to hear what Nick has to say.
[42:30.200 --> 42:32.280]  I want to hear from Nick.
[42:32.840 --> 42:34.180]  I don't know, Gavin really got
[42:34.180 --> 42:35.320]  me with the sauce game.
[42:36.560 --> 42:37.780]  It's something to think about.
[42:38.420 --> 42:40.420]  It is something to think about. Also, there is
[42:40.420 --> 42:42.240]  more stuff on
[42:42.240 --> 42:44.500]  a full English breakfast. There's more stuff.
[42:44.680 --> 42:45.580]  There's more range.
[42:47.600 --> 42:48.560]  Dynamic flavors,
[42:49.640 --> 42:50.600]  different textures
[42:50.600 --> 42:51.660]  and wetnesses.
[42:51.980 --> 42:54.100]  You're advocating wetnesses?
[42:54.640 --> 42:55.800]  Beans love wetness.
[42:55.920 --> 42:56.600]  What's the point?
[42:57.280 --> 42:59.220]  You love a bit of wetness?
[43:00.180 --> 43:00.960]  Beans are wet.
[43:01.680 --> 43:03.880]  I don't want the beans to wet other stuff.
[43:04.020 --> 43:06.180]  That's why I use, as many people
[43:06.180 --> 43:08.180]  do, I use the sausage strategically.
[43:08.860 --> 43:09.660]  It's a little
[43:10.360 --> 43:12.120]  barrier between the bread
[43:12.120 --> 43:13.880]  and the beans. I've never heard
[43:13.880 --> 43:16.340]  such a setup for a product that didn't exist.
[43:16.960 --> 43:18.100]  That's why I use
[43:18.100 --> 43:20.300]  and then it was just I line up my sausages.
[43:20.680 --> 43:21.620]  Sausages exist.
[43:21.620 --> 43:22.660]  You should go there.
[43:23.500 --> 43:24.020]  Sausage?
[43:27.030 --> 43:28.490]  What is this episode?
[43:29.550 --> 43:31.030]  It's good. It's a lot of
[43:31.030 --> 43:33.030]  arguing, but I don't know
[43:33.030 --> 43:34.350]  about what. I think we're just
[43:34.930 --> 43:36.950]  airing out our dirty pillows.
[43:37.470 --> 43:38.390]  I also think if
[43:38.390 --> 43:41.050]  we air out our dirty pillows
[43:41.050 --> 43:42.270]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:42.430 --> 43:44.390]  Our crazy, big, dirty pillows.
[43:45.530 --> 43:46.390]  I think
[43:47.070 --> 43:49.070]  a Mexican breakfast is better.
[43:49.210 --> 43:50.510]  That's what I would prefer too.
[43:50.510 --> 43:52.290]  Oh, I totally agree, dude. You give me some
[43:52.290 --> 43:52.950]  chilaquiles.
[43:55.990 --> 43:56.950]  Chilaquiles, huevos
[43:56.950 --> 43:57.590]  rancheros.
[43:57.930 --> 43:59.550]  Is migas breakfast food?
[44:00.110 --> 44:02.190]  Yes. I've never
[44:02.190 --> 44:04.070]  had migas until I moved here.
[44:04.750 --> 44:05.850]  Really? Oh my god, dude.
[44:05.970 --> 44:08.250]  It's not a thing that I ever had.
[44:08.830 --> 44:10.090]  Huevos rancheros and stuff is
[44:10.090 --> 44:12.330]  what I always had. Migas is so superior
[44:12.330 --> 44:13.830]  to like, man, it's incredible.
[44:14.190 --> 44:15.690]  Is that Tex-Mex or Mex?
[44:16.110 --> 44:17.870]  I think it's definitely more Tex-Mex.
[44:17.870 --> 44:19.910]  The chilaquiles
[44:19.910 --> 44:21.550]  you get at Taco Rito,
[44:21.770 --> 44:23.830]  there are two locations, there's one on Burnet, I believe there's
[44:23.830 --> 44:25.170]  one on Riverside Drive-Thru.
[44:25.750 --> 44:27.810]  Go get the chilaquiles at Taco Rito. It is the
[44:27.810 --> 44:29.950]  best thing you will ever put in your mouth
[44:29.950 --> 44:31.750]  breakfast related. They are so
[44:31.750 --> 44:34.010]  fucking good. I'm a migas
[44:34.010 --> 44:36.030]  fan, but these particular chilaquiles
[44:36.030 --> 44:37.630]  are better than any migas I've ever had.
[44:37.990 --> 44:39.430]  Yeah, I just think that's like...
[44:39.430 --> 44:41.670]  That's your NFT right there.
[44:43.130 --> 44:44.010]  To me,
[44:44.250 --> 44:45.510]  that's like the breakfast
[44:45.950 --> 44:47.130]  that I would pick over
[44:47.130 --> 44:48.710]  all this other stuff we're laying down.
[44:49.150 --> 44:51.110]  We live in the land of
[44:51.110 --> 44:53.410]  superior breakfast tacos, obviously we're gonna go
[44:53.410 --> 44:55.510]  for that. Or kolaches even, I'd pick over
[44:55.510 --> 44:57.450]  anything else. But if we're just gonna
[44:57.450 --> 44:59.370]  compare what I would consider to be an American
[44:59.370 --> 45:00.910]  breakfast to a British breakfast.
[45:01.850 --> 45:03.450]  That's the nice thing about America, we got a lot of options
[45:03.450 --> 45:05.350]  too. We didn't even get into waffles or pancakes.
[45:05.570 --> 45:06.550]  Oh, that's a great point.
[45:07.510 --> 45:08.630]  Oh, look at that.
[45:09.250 --> 45:11.330]  I feel like you've posted this exact
[45:11.330 --> 45:13.570]  photo like 10 times throughout the history of this
[45:13.570 --> 45:13.870]  podcast.
[45:15.690 --> 45:17.690]  Check out these mushrooms, they're kind of
[45:17.690 --> 45:19.070]  by these beans, and then we got like
[45:19.070 --> 45:20.910]  three hockey pucks if you want to take a bite.
[45:21.230 --> 45:23.530]  And I gotta say, it looks pretty dry, this plate, Gavin.
[45:23.590 --> 45:25.590]  Not a lot of liquids. I heard a lot about
[45:25.590 --> 45:27.650]  sauces. The sauce hasn't been put
[45:27.650 --> 45:29.350]  on, because everyone's got a different preference.
[45:30.350 --> 45:31.570]  The sauce doesn't come
[45:31.570 --> 45:32.110]  on the plate.
[45:32.910 --> 45:35.590]  I just mean those beans don't look all that juicy.
[45:36.110 --> 45:36.650]  Well, they are.
[45:38.330 --> 45:39.510]  Gavin holds onto this
[45:39.510 --> 45:41.670]  one photo and shows it like dudes
[45:41.670 --> 45:43.590]  that I was in the army with in basic training.
[45:43.770 --> 45:45.650]  They would have a photo of their girlfriend, which
[45:45.650 --> 45:47.770]  would clearly be a cut-out headshot
[45:47.770 --> 45:49.730]  from the yearbook that they would just have
[45:49.730 --> 45:51.830]  on their table. Like, this is my girlfriend. They would show it to you all the time.
[45:51.910 --> 45:53.230]  Like, she's really hot, isn't she? And you'd be like,
[45:53.530 --> 45:55.190]  yeah, she seems lovely.
[45:55.490 --> 45:56.750]  That's Gavin and this photo.
[45:57.850 --> 45:59.450]  They look a little bit too good to be true.
[45:59.690 --> 46:01.110]  Can I present to you an idea I've been working on?
[46:01.530 --> 46:02.590]  Yes. Please.
[46:03.590 --> 46:04.230]  Oh, shit!
[46:05.530 --> 46:07.750]  I went to paste it and it pasted a picture
[46:07.750 --> 46:08.590]  of a breakfast.
[46:09.850 --> 46:10.310]  Moron!
[46:10.670 --> 46:12.670]  You are really hanging on to that breakfast, man.
[46:14.250 --> 46:15.170]  Alright, it's
[46:15.170 --> 46:16.550]  kind of gameplay related, but
[46:16.550 --> 46:18.370]  I thought we could potentially start a new series
[46:18.370 --> 46:20.750]  called The Wheel of
[46:20.750 --> 46:21.250]  F***.
[46:21.930 --> 46:24.610]  The Wheel of F***. Take a look at this.
[46:25.150 --> 46:26.530]  Vin Master and Dirt.
[46:26.650 --> 46:27.970]  Okay, so we've got a bunch of achievements.
[46:28.850 --> 46:30.310]  So it's just a bunch of very,
[46:30.750 --> 46:32.310]  in my opinion, difficult
[46:32.310 --> 46:34.690]  video game feats. And my
[46:35.390 --> 46:36.570]  idea was that we have to
[46:36.570 --> 46:38.490]  get together, we spin the wheel, and then
[46:38.490 --> 46:40.030]  we just have to do one of these.
[46:41.610 --> 46:42.530]  And these are
[46:42.530 --> 46:44.450]  from like different games. Like, what are
[46:44.450 --> 46:46.590]  these? Are these like different
[46:46.590 --> 46:48.550]  games? Or what are these? I don't know what these are.
[46:48.850 --> 46:50.650]  7 Day Survivor is
[46:50.650 --> 46:52.610]  Dead Rising. Flawless Raider is Destiny.
[46:52.730 --> 46:54.170]  No Point in Dying is Limbo.
[46:54.510 --> 46:55.910]  Go to Second Wheel is Amazing.
[46:56.430 --> 46:58.590]  Mile High Club is Call of Duty. Ultimate Defender
[46:58.590 --> 47:00.490]  is one of the ones we already tried in
[47:00.490 --> 47:02.450]  Grawr. And Vin Master Endure is in
[47:02.450 --> 47:03.650]  Halo 3 ODST.
[47:04.330 --> 47:05.730]  I've got a few
[47:05.730 --> 47:08.050]  of these, but they all take some...
[47:08.050 --> 47:09.590]  a lot of them take some real good
[47:09.590 --> 47:11.630]  co-op time. Is
[47:11.630 --> 47:13.790]  7 Day Survivor co-op?
[47:14.090 --> 47:15.790]  No. And neither is the Limbo one.
[47:16.010 --> 47:17.470]  It's just we would have to... Or Mile High Club.
[47:17.810 --> 47:19.610]  Or Mile High Club, yeah. Mile High Club we could potentially
[47:19.610 --> 47:20.950]  all just try at the same time.
[47:22.130 --> 47:23.210]  I think I've done five of these.
[47:23.590 --> 47:25.610]  Until one of us gets it. Yeah.
[47:26.630 --> 47:27.750]  I've done a few
[47:27.750 --> 47:28.930]  of these already myself.
[47:29.430 --> 47:31.670]  I guided you guys through Flawless Raider, but
[47:31.670 --> 47:33.450]  they patched how I would do that.
[47:33.570 --> 47:35.450]  So I don't know. I don't think that's ever
[47:35.450 --> 47:37.610]  happening again. So are you
[47:37.610 --> 47:39.490]  saying that... I mean, I have this wheel up
[47:39.490 --> 47:41.470]  right now. Are you saying that we spin this wheel and see
[47:41.470 --> 47:41.910]  what happens?
[47:43.630 --> 47:45.530]  I mean, what, like, actually
[47:45.530 --> 47:47.030]  start the series now and then
[47:47.510 --> 47:49.130]  film the main bit another time?
[47:49.970 --> 47:51.550]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, like, let's start
[47:51.550 --> 47:53.370]  the series on this episode to say,
[47:53.470 --> 47:55.390]  hey, we're going to do this thing. Who knows
[47:55.390 --> 47:57.250]  when the fuck it's going to come out, but we're going to do it.
[47:59.030 --> 47:59.610]  Now if
[47:59.610 --> 48:01.650]  it lands on a single player one,
[48:01.850 --> 48:03.610]  do we spin another wheel of all of our
[48:03.610 --> 48:05.710]  names to see who has to do it? I like
[48:05.710 --> 48:07.910]  that idea. Yes. Now that's
[48:07.910 --> 48:09.710]  interesting. The way I saw it happening
[48:09.710 --> 48:11.510]  was that depending on how many people
[48:11.510 --> 48:13.650]  are in that game, we
[48:13.650 --> 48:15.410]  would then spin the wheel that many times to
[48:15.410 --> 48:17.570]  get the cast.
[48:17.850 --> 48:19.450]  Cast? Okay, I like that a lot.
[48:19.450 --> 48:21.790]  I love this idea. So let's spin this first
[48:21.790 --> 48:23.770]  wheel. Okay, you ready? Gavin, are you
[48:23.770 --> 48:25.710]  ready for me to spin this wheel? Everyone's watching
[48:25.710 --> 48:27.290]  the screen? We're all good? I'm watching.
[48:27.290 --> 48:28.990]  Yep. Okay. I'm rolling on it.
[48:29.010 --> 48:31.290]  Alright guys, here we go. We're going to spin the wheel to see
[48:31.290 --> 48:33.450]  what we're going to do.
[48:34.150 --> 48:34.630]  Let's
[48:35.150 --> 48:37.330]  spin that wheel! Nothing on that
[48:37.330 --> 48:39.170]  wheel is fun except for go to second wheel.
[48:41.430 --> 48:41.910]  Uh...
[48:42.590 --> 48:43.070]  and...
[48:43.070 --> 48:43.270]  Oh!
[48:44.810 --> 48:47.490]  Go to second wheel!
[48:49.850 --> 48:51.310]  We have a winner, boys!
[48:51.690 --> 48:53.270]  Holy shit. Looks like we'll
[48:53.270 --> 48:54.570]  be making a second wheel.
[48:54.570 --> 48:55.330]  Okay.
[48:57.930 --> 49:00.210]  This is the lamest
[49:00.210 --> 49:01.890]  thing that could have happened.
[49:02.370 --> 49:02.670]  Boo!
[49:04.050 --> 49:04.570]  Boo!
[49:06.290 --> 49:07.610]  That's how you ruin a wheel.
[49:07.870 --> 49:10.390]  Not even ruin a wheel, ruin
[49:10.390 --> 49:12.430]  a series. I don't think I could have been
[49:12.430 --> 49:14.530]  more excited about whatever was coming next.
[49:15.050 --> 49:16.430]  What do you mean I said there was good stuff
[49:16.430 --> 49:16.990]  on the second wheel?
[49:18.330 --> 49:19.270]  He did!
[49:20.690 --> 49:21.670]  You said that!
[49:21.670 --> 49:23.690]  I really hyped up the second wheel.
[49:23.970 --> 49:25.850]  You said there's good stuff on the second wheel?
[49:25.970 --> 49:26.290]  Yeah!
[49:27.770 --> 49:29.790]  Are you kidding me?
[49:30.210 --> 49:31.310]  That was three minutes ago!
[49:31.690 --> 49:33.710]  I said the second wheel
[49:33.710 --> 49:34.370]  is amazing.
[49:35.510 --> 49:35.790]  Yeah!
[49:36.970 --> 49:38.210]  Which implies good stuff!
[49:39.210 --> 49:41.510]  The second wheel is just our concept of the second wheel.
[49:41.750 --> 49:42.510]  We gotta make it now.
[49:42.830 --> 49:43.590]  This is ridiculous.
[49:44.990 --> 49:45.550]  Damn!
[49:47.470 --> 49:47.790]  What?
[49:48.290 --> 49:50.190]  Whenever we go to the third wheel
[49:50.190 --> 49:52.210]  we don't start putting stuff on it
[49:52.210 --> 49:53.490]  until we get there, surely, don't we?
[49:53.950 --> 49:55.990]  It felt like you presented it like you had
[49:55.990 --> 49:56.510]  a really good second wheel.
[49:56.510 --> 49:59.150]  I think if you're presenting a series that is wheel-based
[49:59.150 --> 50:00.610]  you have all the wheels.
[50:01.030 --> 50:03.910]  It just felt like you really had a second wheel
[50:03.910 --> 50:04.790]  locked in, man.
[50:05.110 --> 50:07.930]  It took me about 20 minutes to come up with the first wheel
[50:07.930 --> 50:10.050]  so I assumed we wouldn't
[50:10.050 --> 50:11.010]  land on the second one.
[50:12.070 --> 50:14.070]  Should we just build the second wheel
[50:14.070 --> 50:15.030]  together right now?
[50:15.030 --> 50:16.050]  We can do that.
[50:16.190 --> 50:17.250]  Is that what we're doing?
[50:17.390 --> 50:18.170]  I'm fine with that.
[50:18.410 --> 50:21.370]  He said, you know what guys, I've got a great idea.
[50:21.450 --> 50:22.850]  Let's all go on a road trip.
[50:23.310 --> 50:24.870]  And he showed us a car and then he went,
[50:24.950 --> 50:26.450]  oh, he didn't put any gas in it.
[50:27.250 --> 50:29.310]  It's the equivalent of me saying,
[50:29.710 --> 50:30.750]  let's go on a road trip.
[50:30.910 --> 50:33.790]  Road trips are great, but I don't actually have a trip in mind.
[50:34.650 --> 50:35.630]  And I don't have a car either.
[50:36.430 --> 50:37.810]  So, first off, we gotta have
[50:37.810 --> 50:39.630]  go back to first wheel, probably.
[50:39.950 --> 50:42.290]  Why don't we just do four go back to first wheels?
[50:42.290 --> 50:43.810]  No, no, we don't have to do that.
[50:44.130 --> 50:46.470]  You could have done that
[50:46.470 --> 50:47.590]  if you had made a second wheel.
[50:47.850 --> 50:49.330]  I think we have one that's
[50:49.990 --> 50:51.950]  play sloppy joes bingo instead.
[50:53.010 --> 50:53.250]  Okay.
[50:54.090 --> 50:56.230]  Maybe one that's make Gavin
[50:56.230 --> 50:58.390]  do everything on the first wheel by himself.
[50:58.630 --> 50:59.070]  Yeah!
[50:59.690 --> 51:01.470]  I don't think it's possible, but I'd give it a go.
[51:01.810 --> 51:03.750]  Also half a car, put half a car on there.
[51:03.890 --> 51:05.110]  Half a car.
[51:05.410 --> 51:06.950]  Do you want me to call Barbara?
[51:08.190 --> 51:09.150]  Call small wife.
[51:09.150 --> 51:09.710]  Okay.
[51:11.390 --> 51:11.790]  Okay.
[51:12.310 --> 51:14.670]  I'm going to list these things out for her.
[51:14.870 --> 51:16.530]  She's not going to know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[51:17.410 --> 51:18.730]  Oh, Eric, go to third wheel.
[51:19.010 --> 51:20.510]  Oh, that's right. Go to third wheel.
[51:20.810 --> 51:21.110]  Okay.
[51:23.070 --> 51:25.470]  Gavin has to beat Donkey Kong 64.
[51:26.170 --> 51:26.790]  Gavin beats
[51:27.650 --> 51:28.050]  DK64.
[51:28.370 --> 51:29.210]  Donkey Kong 64?
[51:30.530 --> 51:32.930]  I surely can't film all of that, can I?
[51:33.370 --> 51:33.770]  No.
[51:34.590 --> 51:35.830]  It's not going to land on it.
[51:35.830 --> 51:37.190]  That's why I have to stream it.
[51:37.710 --> 51:38.910]  Yeah, you can stream it.
[51:39.250 --> 51:40.890]  What else would be on the second wheel?
[51:41.790 --> 51:43.570]  It could be dealer's choice.
[51:44.450 --> 51:44.750]  Oh.
[51:45.810 --> 51:46.610]  That's spicy.
[51:47.730 --> 51:48.270]  Who's the dealer?
[51:48.490 --> 51:50.150]  We'll have to spin for who dealer is.
[51:53.130 --> 51:55.670]  Do we think that's enough stuff? I feel like that's quite a bit.
[51:55.890 --> 51:56.430]  That's quite a bit.
[51:57.270 --> 51:58.030]  Do you want me to shuffle it?
[51:59.190 --> 52:00.990]  How many times do you want me to shuffle it?
[52:02.550 --> 52:02.950]  Uh...
[52:02.950 --> 52:03.310]  Off.
[52:04.150 --> 52:06.630]  One, two. Okay.
[52:06.850 --> 52:08.030]  I think only two things moved.
[52:08.810 --> 52:10.450]  Alright guys, are you ready
[52:10.450 --> 52:13.130]  for the second wheel?
[52:13.810 --> 52:14.850]  Let's spin it.
[52:15.250 --> 52:15.590]  Okay.
[52:16.250 --> 52:17.670]  And here we go!
[52:22.550 --> 52:24.510]  Go back to first wheel!
[52:24.510 --> 52:25.750]  Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
[52:26.730 --> 52:27.290]  Perfect.
[52:27.510 --> 52:28.930]  Go back to first wheel!
[52:29.290 --> 52:30.210]  Let's go back to first.
[52:30.770 --> 52:32.530]  We're back to the first wheel!
[52:33.710 --> 52:35.070]  Alright, are you guys ready?
[52:35.070 --> 52:36.650]  Now the show's back on. Now I'm excited again.
[52:36.710 --> 52:38.130]  Alright, and here we go!
[52:38.250 --> 52:38.810]  Spinning the wheel!
[52:41.390 --> 52:42.190]  Oh god.
[52:44.630 --> 52:45.030]  No!
[52:46.230 --> 52:48.950]  Ladies and gentlemen, go to second wheel!
[52:49.070 --> 52:50.530]  No! What's wrong with this?
[52:51.170 --> 52:51.570]  Alright!
[52:52.050 --> 52:53.950]  What did you do to your wheel, Gavin?
[52:54.090 --> 52:56.290]  How many times do you want me to shuffle this?
[52:56.570 --> 52:57.870]  What's wrong with this wheel?
[52:58.410 --> 52:59.650]  How many times do you want me to shuffle it?
[52:59.650 --> 53:00.430]  Two more times.
[53:00.590 --> 53:02.910]  One, two. A lot of good ones. Here we go.
[53:03.010 --> 53:04.630]  And here's the spin of the second wheel!
[53:06.050 --> 53:07.090]  Oh god.
[53:07.230 --> 53:08.750]  Gavin, why did you do it?
[53:12.240 --> 53:13.540]  Make Gavin do...
[53:14.180 --> 53:15.420]  Make Gavin do
[53:15.420 --> 53:16.680]  first wheel activities!
[53:17.220 --> 53:19.340]  So, now, we go back
[53:19.340 --> 53:21.040]  to the first wheel
[53:21.700 --> 53:23.300]  to see what thing
[53:23.300 --> 53:24.620]  Gavin is going to do.
[53:24.740 --> 53:27.040]  Gavin, you'll be doing one of these activities.
[53:27.300 --> 53:28.100]  Are you ready?
[53:28.100 --> 53:29.620]  I'm so ready.
[53:29.840 --> 53:31.240]  Here we go!
[53:32.580 --> 53:33.680]  Gavin, you might have to recruit.
[53:33.680 --> 53:34.400]  I'll have to recruit.
[53:34.660 --> 53:36.840]  But it's the first one.
[53:37.300 --> 53:37.580]  No!
[53:39.260 --> 53:41.500]  Gavin has to do no point in dying
[53:42.100 --> 53:42.960]  in Limbo.
[53:44.040 --> 53:45.840]  And if you guys can explain
[53:45.840 --> 53:48.020]  what no point in dying is, go for it.
[53:48.260 --> 53:50.160]  I believe it's beat Limbo,
[53:50.280 --> 53:51.060]  right, without dying?
[53:51.780 --> 53:54.480]  The entirety of Limbo with less than five deaths.
[53:54.980 --> 53:55.360]  Okay.
[53:56.100 --> 53:56.840]  Sounds good.
[53:56.860 --> 53:58.360]  I'm excited to watch this.
[53:58.640 --> 53:59.720]  Have you ever done that, Gavin?
[54:01.080 --> 54:02.500]  Have you ever tried?
[54:02.760 --> 54:04.900]  I think it's the only achievement I'm missing in that game.
[54:05.380 --> 54:07.240]  Oh, that's great! That's awesome, man!
[54:08.240 --> 54:08.940]  Not for long.
[54:09.620 --> 54:10.620]  Not for long!
[54:11.160 --> 54:12.800]  This could be an ongoing series
[54:12.800 --> 54:14.940]  where we just sort of like...
[54:14.940 --> 54:16.640]  We kind of like grab time.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.320]  Completely, in every aspect of this stupid
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.300]  idea, I f***ing face the shit
[54:21.300 --> 54:22.020]  out of myself.
[54:22.020 --> 54:23.220]  You idiot!
[54:25.500 --> 54:25.820]  Moron!
[54:28.360 --> 54:29.800]  Well, I feel like you just tipped
[54:29.800 --> 54:31.540]  the hand of the question I was going to ask, but
[54:31.540 --> 54:33.980]  now that we're post-first episode of the game,
[54:34.020 --> 54:35.860]  how do you feel about your new idea?
[54:36.940 --> 54:37.580]  I suck!
[54:39.400 --> 54:40.080]  Oh, you better
[54:40.080 --> 54:41.620]  get good, because you gotta
[54:42.060 --> 54:44.000]  not die. So what do we
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.960]  need to do? Well, just like, next time we're going to be playing
[54:45.960 --> 54:47.980]  a game, instead of us playing a game, it'll be
[54:50.760 --> 54:51.080]  Gavin...
[54:51.080 --> 54:52.520]  You say Limbo?
[54:53.120 --> 54:55.140]  It's going to be like an 8-hour
[54:55.140 --> 54:56.480]  arcade game.
[54:57.020 --> 54:59.340]  Oh, it's the little black and white...
[54:59.340 --> 55:01.000]  It's like the shadow scary boy
[55:01.000 --> 55:01.740]  game. Oh!
[55:03.500 --> 55:04.760]  Yeah, you're f***ed, buddy!
[55:05.240 --> 55:07.080]  Yeah, and the little frickin' worm goes in
[55:07.080 --> 55:08.840]  your head. Or is it worm, or like something else?
[55:09.240 --> 55:10.280]  I don't know, I guess we're going to find out.
[55:10.480 --> 55:12.020]  I never played that game. It looked too hard.
[55:12.840 --> 55:15.160]  It is hard. And there's a bunch of traps
[55:15.160 --> 55:16.760]  that are just like total F.U. traps
[55:16.760 --> 55:17.640]  that you have to know about.
[55:17.640 --> 55:19.460]  Yeah. Do you know about them?
[55:19.520 --> 55:20.100]  It's definitely going to take a little bit.
[55:20.980 --> 55:23.160]  Sweet! It's going to be a good series.
[55:23.660 --> 55:25.600]  Gotta put bear traps down to like
[55:25.600 --> 55:27.660]  hit spider legs. Isn't it
[55:27.660 --> 55:29.520]  only like a 3-hour game?
[55:29.540 --> 55:30.940]  It is very short. It's pretty short.
[55:31.260 --> 55:33.660]  We could do it in one sitting. Yeah, just one stream.
[55:33.860 --> 55:35.740]  That is kind of the way you do it. You can do it on Friday, we'll watch.
[55:36.220 --> 55:36.400]  Yeah.
[55:38.200 --> 55:39.660]  So is that what we're doing? On Friday
[55:39.660 --> 55:41.820]  we're going to do that? This is such a backfire.
[55:41.960 --> 55:43.000]  On Friday that this comes out?
[55:43.240 --> 55:44.840]  We've got like 8 things to make on Friday.
[55:44.840 --> 55:45.320]  Laughing
[55:47.720 --> 55:48.640]  I'm just trying
[55:48.640 --> 55:50.940]  to make room for your idea, Gavin.
[55:51.080 --> 55:52.440]  I'm sorry. Sorry, man.
[55:52.680 --> 55:54.220]  I really apologize.
[55:54.620 --> 55:56.820]  I really apologize that I was trying to make room
[55:56.820 --> 55:57.900]  for your idea, dude.
[55:59.060 --> 56:00.840]  I'm so glad that
[56:00.840 --> 56:02.860]  it wasn't Flawless Raider because we're just
[56:02.860 --> 56:05.020]  not getting that. Yeah, don't punish us
[56:05.020 --> 56:07.120]  for supporting you and your creativity.
[56:07.540 --> 56:08.940]  Because they changed how
[56:08.940 --> 56:09.940]  we did it before.
[56:10.660 --> 56:11.920]  You can't do it that way anymore.
[56:11.920 --> 56:13.020]  Oh, really?
[56:13.580 --> 56:16.020]  Yeah, like they updated
[56:16.020 --> 56:18.000]  that raid. They took away a lot of
[56:18.000 --> 56:18.560]  those cheats.
[56:19.460 --> 56:20.420]  Oh, shit.
[56:21.960 --> 56:24.260]  We just would have never completed that.
[56:24.620 --> 56:26.100]  Well, it's surely still doable.
[56:26.580 --> 56:27.800]  Not by us, though.
[56:27.900 --> 56:28.960]  Not by us.
[56:30.360 --> 56:32.100]  A whole raid without
[56:32.100 --> 56:33.320]  dying? No.
[56:34.240 --> 56:35.460]  Huh. Gavin,
[56:35.640 --> 56:37.460]  have you seen us?
[56:38.400 --> 56:39.000]  Yeah.
[56:39.640 --> 56:40.660]  Oh, okay then.
[56:41.100 --> 56:43.080]  We'd have to set a new standard of it of
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.000]  not a continuous
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.120]  run. Complete each
[56:47.120 --> 56:49.200]  section individually at some point
[56:49.200 --> 56:50.360]  in which we didn't die.
[56:50.940 --> 56:53.100]  I mean, fuck, one of us can't
[56:53.100 --> 56:55.020]  even beat Limbo without dying five
[56:55.020 --> 56:57.140]  times. Now all four of us are going to beat a
[56:57.140 --> 56:58.200]  raid without dying once?
[56:58.980 --> 57:00.940]  I think as far as what you could have
[57:00.940 --> 57:03.020]  landed on, that was probably the easiest
[57:03.020 --> 57:05.020]  of them, Gavin. Yeah, but I was just
[57:05.020 --> 57:06.480]  bummed that it was only me.
[57:06.480 --> 57:08.560]  Well, yeah, you should have built out the
[57:08.560 --> 57:09.780]  second wheel. Yeah.
[57:11.420 --> 57:11.820]  Yeah.
[57:12.100 --> 57:13.760]  We'll all be there, so it'll be alright.
[57:14.100 --> 57:16.560]  Once again, though, a lot of these are only single player.
[57:17.320 --> 57:18.420]  Mile High Club, single player,
[57:18.460 --> 57:19.420]  that would have been just you.
[57:20.840 --> 57:22.420]  That one I just envisioned all of us
[57:22.420 --> 57:23.920]  doing it. Oh, simultaneously?
[57:24.360 --> 57:25.440]  Yeah. Okay.
[57:26.220 --> 57:28.340]  It's like arcade mode, it's very quick.
[57:28.440 --> 57:30.440]  Quick resets. It could be a fun thing
[57:30.440 --> 57:32.280]  where, like, once you're done,
[57:32.340 --> 57:33.560]  you can just leave the recording.
[57:33.560 --> 57:36.120]  Oh my god.
[57:36.260 --> 57:37.840]  It's the first one to do it in the video
[57:37.840 --> 57:39.500]  and the last one to do it in the video.
[57:39.680 --> 57:41.360]  Yeah, it's not done until
[57:41.360 --> 57:42.880]  every single one does it.
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.440]  Let's remember that.
[57:44.700 --> 57:47.440]  That's so funny. Let's definitely
[57:47.440 --> 57:49.660]  remember that. I love that.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.620]  It would be so...
[57:52.620 --> 57:53.800]  Just being the last
[57:53.800 --> 57:55.160]  one would be so sad.
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.580]  Speaking of that, what was the idea
[57:57.580 --> 57:59.720]  we were talking about the other night, Eric, that we were gonna remember
[57:59.720 --> 58:01.260]  where everybody puts in $100
[58:01.260 --> 58:02.700]  but only one person loses?
[58:03.160 --> 58:05.300]  We had an idea for if we were
[58:05.300 --> 58:07.280]  doing Mario Party again, it would have
[58:07.280 --> 58:09.060]  to be a five-player game, whatever it is,
[58:09.540 --> 58:11.360]  and just doing it over time
[58:11.360 --> 58:13.180]  this way. We would
[58:13.180 --> 58:14.900]  all pick a
[58:14.900 --> 58:17.200]  valuable item of some
[58:17.200 --> 58:19.020]  kind that we each personally
[58:20.040 --> 58:21.160]  like. We would
[58:21.160 --> 58:23.500]  put them all in one place and then
[58:24.640 --> 58:25.160]  this
[58:25.160 --> 58:27.180]  five-player game, if you finish
[58:27.180 --> 58:29.120]  first through fourth, you get your item
[58:29.120 --> 58:31.020]  back. But if you finish dead last, your
[58:31.020 --> 58:32.580]  item is destroyed in front of you.
[58:33.360 --> 58:33.800]  Yeah.
[58:41.480 --> 58:43.140]  That also could be a fun
[58:43.140 --> 58:44.280]  thing with the wheel.
[58:44.900 --> 58:47.140]  Where you don't know what place is losing their
[58:47.140 --> 58:48.920]  item until after we spin a wheel.
[58:49.380 --> 58:50.880]  Oh, wow! Imagine
[58:50.880 --> 58:52.700]  it's first and it's like, oh my god.
[58:53.940 --> 58:55.220]  Everybody's fighting not to win.
[58:56.540 --> 58:57.080]  That's a
[58:57.080 --> 58:58.020]  really interesting mechanic.
[58:58.700 --> 59:00.620]  Speaking of interesting and
[59:00.620 --> 59:02.860]  Friday being a busy day, we
[59:02.860 --> 59:05.060]  need to talk about this briefly if you don't mind.
[59:05.200 --> 59:07.080]  We're going to record Birth Year Movie Ranker
[59:07.080 --> 59:08.200]  on Friday. I'm good there.
[59:08.760 --> 59:11.140]  But we're recording the Moon Ranker supplemental
[59:11.140 --> 59:11.720]  on Friday.
[59:12.080 --> 59:15.180]  If I could just get a refresh on what constitutes
[59:15.180 --> 59:17.100]  what a Moon Ranker is.
[59:17.520 --> 59:18.720]  Aspects of the moon, you know, moon
[59:18.720 --> 59:20.440]  stuff. But it's not a draft.
[59:21.340 --> 59:23.000]  I mean, we're
[59:23.000 --> 59:24.760]  drafting these moon things and then we
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.800]  rank them. Is it like moon
[59:26.800 --> 59:27.480]  not moon?
[59:28.460 --> 59:30.440]  I don't know. What do you think?
[59:31.840 --> 59:32.880]  Rank moon
[59:32.880 --> 59:34.660]  stuff. I'm kind of
[59:34.660 --> 59:36.540]  excited for it to not be clarified
[59:36.540 --> 59:38.760]  and see what everybody brings. It's the moon,
[59:38.860 --> 59:39.020]  dude.
[59:40.060 --> 59:42.560]  But I don't think you can grab
[59:42.560 --> 59:44.800]  the moon itself.
[59:45.020 --> 59:46.120]  Like the actual moon.
[59:47.120 --> 59:48.800]  You can't draft... So it's moon not moon?
[59:49.760 --> 59:50.780]  No, because you can get other
[59:50.780 --> 59:52.640]  moons. It's just that our moon
[59:52.640 --> 59:53.880]  would have to be off limits.
[59:53.960 --> 59:56.740]  Our Earth's moon
[59:56.740 --> 59:58.340]  is off limits.
[59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.400]  But indoor would be fine.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.120]  I don't have a problem with that.
[01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.540]  You're ranking that. I just
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.560]  think that in terms of a moon
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.220]  ranker, moon would have to be number one.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.520]  So we have to eliminate it from the pool.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.480]  It's the thing that we are
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.340]  doing it around, so you cannot pick it.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.000]  Right. Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.600]  So that's it. That's Moon Ranker.
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.460]  Also, I definitely
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.340]  think that Moon Ranker
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.420]  sounds like Moon Raker, and that's
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.420]  mostly why we're doing this, because it's a lot of fun.
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.460]  Jimmy Bond and Moon Ranker?
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.220]  Yeah. So, there you go.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.380]  Okay, cool. Thank you for the elucidation.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.300]  That helps me out a lot. Sure, man.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.420]  Shall we wrap this episode
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.860]  up? Yeah!
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.460]  Because we got more stuff to do. We got another episode
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:42.520]  we gotta record. Yeah, I gotta watch some guides
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.420]  on Limbo, apparently.
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.060]  Yes, you do!
[01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:47.920]  Who here has the achievement?
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:49.880]  I tried
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.020]  for it, and I just didn't follow
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.980]  through. Andrew's the best gamer we
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.980]  know, too. I looked at it. That sucks. Interesting.
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.020]  So if anyone wants to play alongside me
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:00:59.980]  and work on this as a little
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.580]  team. Well, I don't want to go against the wheel.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.040]  So, I'm gonna respect the
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.900]  wheel. Yeah, I think if anyone in the audience
[01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.900]  wants to go alongside Gavin and
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.060]  do this also, I say go for it.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.060]  If it didn't land on
[01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:13.980]  Gavin does it by himself on the second wheel,
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.900]  then I would gladly do this with you.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.140]  It would be disrespectful to the wheel.
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.820]  It would be. Gotta
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.800]  honor the wheel. Imagine if the series
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.240]  couldn't progress unless I
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.820]  beat Destiny Raid solo.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.200]  Oh my god.
[01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:33.880]  Well, there you
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.060]  have it. Thanks for listening to this episode.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.780]  Check out the
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:39.880]  Patreon. Check out Mario Party March,
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.680]  which is coming to a close
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.760]  as the release of this episode.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.040]  We're getting near the end.
[01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.640]  Incredible, incredible stuff.
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.720]  By the time you hear the
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.720]  next episode, it will be over. However,
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.760]  we will have not done it because we have to
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.820]  double record this episode this week. So,
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.860]  who will win Mario Party March?
[01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.320]  It's a mystery even to us.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.580]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.840]  You can check it out over there.
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.460]  Bye. Oh, okay.
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:07.720]  I was gonna say you'll
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.440]  know before we do, but then I didn't
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.080]  really...
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.140]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:16.020]  So then I just pivoted to buy.
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.540]  I liked it.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.540]  That seemed to throw everybody. But a buy is
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.360]  how you close out. Bye.
[01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.320]  We'll see you next time.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:24.680]  Bye.
