[00:00.000 --> 00:06.120]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 47,
[00:06.380 --> 00:14.220]  which has got to be about our 253rd, 254th episode or so. With me as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin
[00:14.220 --> 00:19.720]  Free, The Mechanic, LowRookieBee, and I don't know if I've said my name or not, but I'm Geoff.
[00:20.060 --> 00:21.940]  How, why do you never know the exact number?
[00:22.560 --> 00:27.100]  Well, it's like 205, 206 or 206, 207. Then you got to do the math and you got to add the episode
[00:27.100 --> 00:32.340]  number. I can never remember if it was 206 or 207 that we did. I don't remember if it was like
[00:32.340 --> 00:36.740]  207 episodes across 206 episodes or 206 across 205.
[00:36.740 --> 00:42.760]  I thought it was 206 because there was one episode for every bone of the human body.
[00:43.340 --> 00:44.080]  But we skipped one.
[00:44.120 --> 00:46.600]  Right, but episode 196 we skipped.
[00:46.880 --> 00:47.840]  What bone did we miss?
[00:48.440 --> 00:49.200]  Maybe the...
[00:49.200 --> 00:50.120]  Probably the wiener bone.
[00:50.480 --> 00:50.980]  Fibia.
[00:51.520 --> 00:53.400]  The fibia is an important bone.
[00:53.400 --> 00:59.200]  That would be a real problem. If you were building a human and you're like,
[00:59.260 --> 01:05.060]  okay, I did it all. Oh, wait, there's a bone in the box. That would be a problem.
[01:05.340 --> 01:09.720]  A fibia, if it was the fibia bone, you're like going over to other people and be like,
[01:09.760 --> 01:16.280]  hey, did you get a spare bone? Oh no, you didn't. Oh no. Oh, this person is going to be in trouble.
[01:16.620 --> 01:19.340]  If you had to lose a bone, Andrew, which one would you go for?
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.340]  If I had to lose a bone?
[01:21.920 --> 01:22.280]  Stirrup.
[01:23.200 --> 01:25.940]  Oh, immediately the pinkies come to mind.
[01:26.300 --> 01:26.740]  What?
[01:27.520 --> 01:29.620]  Uh, baby toe. Maybe the baby toe?
[01:30.580 --> 01:33.200]  I don't know. I think you need all the balance you can get with your ankles.
[01:33.760 --> 01:34.600]  That's true.
[01:35.740 --> 01:37.520]  You're just handicapping your handicap.
[01:38.020 --> 01:40.900]  But maybe that's the way to go. Maybe just make it worse.
[01:41.380 --> 01:44.840]  Because it's already not good. Maybe just like embrace the bad.
[01:45.360 --> 01:48.820]  What if you just like went with it, like just had one less rib?
[01:49.640 --> 01:51.500]  Oh yeah, you could suck yourself off and all that.
[01:51.500 --> 01:54.700]  Yeah, yeah. And that's and that's the way God created woman.
[01:55.080 --> 01:55.860]  So that's true.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.940]  Oh yeah, that's true.
[01:58.100 --> 02:00.080]  Do a woman really have one less rib?
[02:04.480 --> 02:07.480]  Do woman really have one less rib?
[02:07.780 --> 02:09.760]  That's the title of this episode.
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.300]  Is that bollocks?
[02:13.480 --> 02:17.360]  You have an ability as and I've known you for most of your life now.
[02:17.460 --> 02:19.080]  One of the smartest people I've ever met.
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.820]  You have an ability to sound so unbelievably stupid when you speak.
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.200]  That's how I make a living.
[02:27.320 --> 02:30.080]  It's just impressive, man. It's it really is impressive.
[02:31.260 --> 02:31.740]  Wow.
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.500]  I wanted a whole category of what Gavin could speculate for women called do woman.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.200]  Just a whole thing.
[02:38.400 --> 02:38.920]  Does woman?
[02:39.540 --> 02:43.920]  We're walking in this dangerous territory.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.700]  This is bad. This is bad.
[02:46.140 --> 02:46.780]  You said it.
[02:47.500 --> 02:48.460]  But you did say it.
[02:49.620 --> 02:50.800]  It's the Jeopardy category.
[02:51.200 --> 02:51.600]  Do woman?
[02:53.560 --> 02:55.060]  Do woman have less rib?
[02:56.720 --> 02:58.820]  But is it bollocks then? Is it shit?
[02:59.020 --> 02:59.900]  Is it a little shite?
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.760]  Yes, it's bullshit.
[03:00.880 --> 03:01.120]  Okay.
[03:01.180 --> 03:02.100]  We both did the same amount.
[03:02.280 --> 03:02.600]  All right.
[03:03.280 --> 03:04.520]  Well, I mean, I don't think it's obvious.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.660]  Wait, just to be clear, are you asking is Adam and Eve shit?
[03:09.200 --> 03:09.780]  Is that the question?
[03:09.800 --> 03:10.320]  No, I'm not Adam and Eve.
[03:10.500 --> 03:11.240]  I'm just there.
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.740]  There are certain anatomical differences between a man and a woman.
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.060]  I was wondering if that one was real.
[03:16.620 --> 03:17.620]  If a man loves a woman.
[03:23.320 --> 03:27.820]  I think when Meg gets to this episode, she's going to be an Andrew Sympathizer again.
[03:28.300 --> 03:28.860]  She might be.
[03:29.200 --> 03:30.640]  Because for everyone that she...
[03:30.640 --> 03:32.880]  Because she's now given me a list of stuff she disagrees with.
[03:33.060 --> 03:37.400]  She is still delivering me the stuff that she is an Andrew Sympathizer for.
[03:37.640 --> 03:37.980]  Oh, wow.
[03:38.040 --> 03:38.460]  Good, good, good.
[03:38.840 --> 03:39.760]  This is so fascinating.
[03:40.020 --> 03:41.120]  What episode is she on, do you know?
[03:41.260 --> 03:42.140]  Yeah, what's the most recent?
[03:42.480 --> 03:43.800]  She's up to like 20 something.
[03:44.620 --> 03:45.020]  Wow.
[03:45.560 --> 03:48.760]  Last episode, you talked about stuff that she didn't agree with Andrew on.
[03:48.760 --> 03:50.900]  Which I'm sure, you know, it's a laundry list and...
[03:50.900 --> 03:51.420]  Oh, it's so much more.
[03:51.640 --> 03:52.100]  The greatest hits.
[03:52.440 --> 03:54.700]  What are some of the things that she did agree with Andrew on?
[03:54.740 --> 03:55.620]  Do you have that list?
[03:55.920 --> 03:56.540]  I'm just curious.
[03:57.040 --> 03:58.220]  Much shorter list, I would assume.
[03:58.380 --> 03:59.360]  I mean, I would assume.
[03:59.360 --> 03:59.840]  I would have to think.
[04:00.300 --> 04:01.020]  There's been a few.
[04:01.100 --> 04:02.060]  I don't think I wrote those down.
[04:02.160 --> 04:03.180]  I'll have to go back and...
[04:03.180 --> 04:05.800]  When she told us that like the pencil thing was like...
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.180]  She's like, oh, we got to like the pencil thing.
[04:08.240 --> 04:09.100]  It's like episode 16.
[04:09.460 --> 04:12.840]  It's like, I can't believe that that happened that early for this show.
[04:13.020 --> 04:14.140]  That's unreal to me.
[04:14.300 --> 04:14.360]  Immediate.
[04:14.520 --> 04:14.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:14.920 --> 04:16.120]  I thought...
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.520]  If you would have asked me, I would have said like 40.
[04:17.520 --> 04:19.480]  Like, no, 16?
[04:19.980 --> 04:20.780]  That's unreal.
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.740]  It was Andrew dipping his foot into the heel pool and then immediately retreating.
[04:29.260 --> 04:31.840]  Yeah, the worst part of that is we batch recorded this.
[04:33.180 --> 04:34.420]  It was all done.
[04:34.640 --> 04:36.720]  And then the initial reaction when I was like,
[04:37.180 --> 04:38.420]  ramping up was not good.
[04:38.480 --> 04:40.060]  And there's this, oh boy, we are...
[04:40.060 --> 04:43.000]  We're on an on-ramp to the highway that we cannot change.
[04:43.300 --> 04:46.880]  It is so important to the foundation of who we are.
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.560]  I'm so glad I wouldn't have taken it any other way.
[04:49.640 --> 04:52.420]  It was like trying to steer a car after you've already hit the jump.
[04:52.660 --> 04:53.740]  Like the wheels aren't doing anything.
[04:56.600 --> 04:58.480]  Oh no, it's not like Grand Theft Auto!
[05:01.260 --> 05:03.700]  Do you think you would notice if you had one less rib?
[05:05.500 --> 05:08.580]  Uh, I think if it was in the middle, I would notice.
[05:08.700 --> 05:10.560]  If I was a UFC fighter, I would.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.940]  I just wonder, like, I don't, I don't feel like I...
[05:15.440 --> 05:17.720]  I want, like, I don't feel like my ribs are doing much.
[05:17.840 --> 05:19.500]  They clearly are, but...
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.100]  I've never walked around and been like, boy, glad I have ribs.
[05:27.180 --> 05:29.480]  You've never, like, walked into something and been like,
[05:29.740 --> 05:32.060]  man, I'm glad my heart didn't take that impact.
[05:33.020 --> 05:34.920]  Well, the ribs are below the heart, aren't they?
[05:35.700 --> 05:36.580]  Where do the ribs go?
[05:36.880 --> 05:37.260]  This is...
[05:38.120 --> 05:38.900]  I'm at a 10 again.
[05:39.240 --> 05:42.780]  I'm at a full 10 right now, Geoff.
[05:42.820 --> 05:43.780]  Where do the ribs end?
[05:44.420 --> 05:45.140]  The ribs...
[05:45.820 --> 05:48.080]  Have you ever felt your collarbone?
[05:48.920 --> 05:49.140]  Yeah.
[05:49.960 --> 05:52.480]  There's no way you're telling me the ribs go up to the collarbone.
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.540]  Zero percent chance.
[05:55.040 --> 05:55.980]  What's below your collarbone?
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.380]  Uh, like a breastplate?
[06:01.360 --> 06:02.080]  Chest?
[06:02.620 --> 06:03.340]  Chestbone?
[06:04.920 --> 06:05.640]  Chestbone?
[06:05.840 --> 06:06.780]  What's the chestbone?
[06:06.860 --> 06:07.600]  The sternum?
[06:08.080 --> 06:09.720]  What's the sternum in the middle of?
[06:10.460 --> 06:11.560]  The chest?
[06:13.920 --> 06:14.320]  Ah!
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.320]  All right, man.
[06:18.600 --> 06:20.620]  Prepare to learn something about yourself.
[06:21.380 --> 06:21.780]  Let's see.
[06:21.940 --> 06:23.280]  Okay, let's look at this.
[06:23.680 --> 06:25.800]  I would hate to lose a rib in the middle of the ribs.
[06:26.040 --> 06:27.360]  It would have to be the bottom rib.
[06:27.440 --> 06:28.220]  It would have to be ribbed in.
[06:28.740 --> 06:31.120]  I mean, the ribs go all the way up.
[06:31.560 --> 06:34.520]  Man, when I think of ribs, that is not what I visualize.
[06:34.740 --> 06:36.580]  The ribs go all the way up!
[06:36.700 --> 06:38.380]  So you thought it was more of, like, a belt?
[06:39.340 --> 06:43.580]  Yeah, like, maybe I'm thinking of, like, cartoon ribs when they show ribs in cartoons.
[06:44.340 --> 06:45.580]  Like Fred Flintstone?
[06:46.380 --> 06:47.420]  That's real ribs, though.
[06:47.900 --> 06:49.600]  They don't...
[06:49.600 --> 06:51.020]  Here, let me see if I can find...
[06:52.300 --> 06:53.880]  Where did you think the ribs were?
[06:53.940 --> 06:55.100]  Just around the waist?
[06:55.420 --> 06:56.900]  Around the bottom of the lung?
[06:57.420 --> 07:03.260]  Andrew's looking at cartoon skeletons playing the xylophone and going, dude, this anatomy's nuts!
[07:03.980 --> 07:07.680]  I'm trying to find what I would think of as the ribs.
[07:11.040 --> 07:12.740]  Yeah, I thought...
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.900]  Uh, could somebody...
[07:14.900 --> 07:19.340]  Let me find an image of a person, and I'll tell you where I thought the ribs...
[07:19.340 --> 07:24.640]  I always did find it strange that the ribs kind of give up at the bottom of the sternum.
[07:24.720 --> 07:25.440]  There's just...
[07:25.440 --> 07:27.660]  They're like, we don't need one around the stomach and things.
[07:28.280 --> 07:28.480]  Yeah.
[07:29.680 --> 07:31.780]  I was looking for ribs, and I...
[07:31.780 --> 07:33.760]  Okay, that's half a rack of ribs.
[07:34.140 --> 07:34.980]  Okay, person.
[07:35.040 --> 07:35.800]  Let me find a person.
[07:36.560 --> 07:40.080]  Here, I dropped an image in there of just a person.
[07:40.500 --> 07:41.840]  There's, like, anatomy.
[07:42.740 --> 07:43.900]  So where do you think...
[07:44.840 --> 07:46.240]  Like, where do you think the ribs are?
[07:46.240 --> 07:47.260]  Point to where your ribs are.
[07:47.340 --> 07:47.740]  Let me re...
[07:47.740 --> 07:48.760]  Yeah, let me remix.
[07:48.980 --> 07:50.520]  I'm remixing this image for you.
[07:51.440 --> 07:52.440]  Uh, okay.
[07:52.480 --> 07:53.480]  I'm excited about this.
[07:54.460 --> 07:55.920]  I would, uh...
[07:57.760 --> 07:59.880]  I would think ribs...
[07:59.880 --> 08:01.240]  Flintstones is fucking wild.
[08:01.500 --> 08:03.300]  Just looking at images of the Flintstones.
[08:04.160 --> 08:04.460]  Okay.
[08:05.260 --> 08:07.240]  I blackboxed the ribs.
[08:08.040 --> 08:08.300]  Okay.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.640]  You're a fucking psychopath.
[08:11.400 --> 08:14.840]  Just for everyone listening at home, he circled the intestines.
[08:15.560 --> 08:16.020]  Your tummy.
[08:16.560 --> 08:18.960]  You thought all of your ribs were where the ribs end?
[08:19.640 --> 08:19.820]  Yeah.
[08:20.000 --> 08:20.720]  Yeah, I guess.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.560]  You thought your ribs started where the softest part of you starts?
[08:24.940 --> 08:25.660]  Here's the thing.
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.040]  When I see the ribs that you guys are posting of the rib cage,
[08:30.180 --> 08:32.120]  it's like, yeah, that is what that looks like.
[08:32.340 --> 08:36.680]  But when I imagine where my ribs are, that is what I imagine.
[08:37.060 --> 08:37.900]  What do you mean, though?
[08:37.900 --> 08:40.360]  Because you've drawn a square right at the bottom.
[08:40.360 --> 08:44.020]  You've maybe encompassed the two lower ribs of 12.
[08:44.840 --> 08:45.240]  How...
[08:46.240 --> 08:47.280]  Uh, 24 total, I guess.
[08:48.720 --> 08:52.100]  Do you just feel your bottom rib and think this is the beginning?
[08:52.720 --> 08:53.320]  Well, I don't...
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.840]  Listen, I'm not feeling ribs at all.
[08:54.940 --> 08:56.000]  I'm not trying for ribs.
[08:56.560 --> 08:56.920]  But if you...
[08:56.920 --> 08:57.400]  They're just there.
[08:57.600 --> 08:59.400]  As I said, I never really think about them.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.300]  Looking at the rib cage, though, I do feel confident I could lose one of those.
[09:05.400 --> 09:06.240]  I don't need all of those.
[09:07.340 --> 09:08.680]  Yeah, get rid of some of those.
[09:09.200 --> 09:12.660]  You wouldn't even know where to look for it after you lost it.
[09:12.960 --> 09:13.740]  That's true.
[09:14.940 --> 09:19.620]  If you took away the third rib, I wouldn't even know I had a rib there.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.660]  So Eric said it's in everybody.
[09:21.920 --> 09:25.080]  You probably would, though, if someone pressed on your chest and it kind of
[09:25.560 --> 09:27.760]  went further in than everywhere else.
[09:27.840 --> 09:31.220]  I'm, you know, I'm actively avoiding chest presses.
[09:33.360 --> 09:34.400]  Generally speaking.
[09:34.400 --> 09:41.420]  We started this making fun of Gavin because of the do woman really have one less rib?
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.200]  And Andrew is telling us that he thinks his ribs are around his stomach.
[09:46.400 --> 09:48.960]  And I'm like, something's wrong.
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.300]  It's like crazy.
[09:50.580 --> 09:53.560]  He thinks your ribs go where you wear a wrestling belt.
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.000]  Well, that's what the Hulk Hogan's championship title was there
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.180]  to protect his ribs when he had to take on the Undertaker.
[10:07.700 --> 10:09.760]  I can't protect these guts.
[10:11.120 --> 10:18.220]  How could the ultimate warrior defeat the Macho Man Randy Savage without his world title?
[10:21.380 --> 10:25.600]  If you had ribs there, Andrew, and I assume the actual reason we don't have ribs there
[10:25.600 --> 10:26.980]  is because you wouldn't be able to bend.
[10:27.760 --> 10:28.860]  All of your ribs would hit.
[10:29.720 --> 10:32.760]  See, I think I think reverberation might be my enemy.
[10:33.360 --> 10:33.840]  What?
[10:34.320 --> 10:34.800]  Reverberate.
[10:35.240 --> 10:38.180]  So here's I searched because I was thinking, where would I?
[10:38.780 --> 10:39.900]  Or would I reference this?
[10:39.940 --> 10:41.860]  Like, why would I visually imagine this?
[10:42.140 --> 10:44.140]  This is I googled man breaks ribs.
[10:44.520 --> 10:50.140]  Here's a photo of someone in a fight having their ribs broken.
[10:52.020 --> 10:53.140]  That's kind of low.
[10:53.660 --> 10:54.940]  I think there's reverberation.
[10:55.300 --> 10:56.420]  That's where your ribs still are.
[10:56.580 --> 10:57.620]  Yeah, look at the picture above.
[10:58.500 --> 10:59.800]  He got kicked under his arm.
[11:00.200 --> 11:01.140]  That's where your ribs are.
[11:01.140 --> 11:01.880]  Yeah.
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.440]  Yeah, but under the.
[11:05.660 --> 11:07.260]  Look at where his waist is.
[11:07.520 --> 11:11.720]  Look at where his look at where his leg, like his thigh ends and it's bending.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.700]  Look at how high up he's getting kicked.
[11:13.760 --> 11:16.200]  This could be a very long back problem as well.
[11:16.260 --> 11:17.400]  I just think my proportions.
[11:17.860 --> 11:18.980]  Oh, my God.
[11:20.180 --> 11:22.580]  I think my proportions are way off when I.
[11:22.680 --> 11:23.460]  You think your ribs are low?
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.160]  No, I don't know if my ribs are low.
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.020]  I just feel like when I'm evaluating where something is in regards to somebody else.
[11:31.600 --> 11:32.740]  I think it's off.
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.060]  I'm wondering whether you have misconceptions about other body parts.
[11:39.560 --> 11:40.600]  Feel free to ask.
[11:41.340 --> 11:43.120]  I just don't even know where to start.
[11:43.400 --> 11:44.520]  Yeah, just throwing out.
[11:46.180 --> 11:47.240]  Got five fingers.
[11:47.780 --> 11:50.700]  I wouldn't have thought that ribs would have led us to where we are now.
[11:51.100 --> 11:54.580]  Like, well, thumb is like it's a finger, but it's not a finger, right?
[11:54.660 --> 11:55.600]  Doesn't it have a different name?
[11:56.400 --> 11:56.640]  Thumb?
[11:57.120 --> 11:57.760]  Yeah, the thumb.
[11:58.140 --> 11:59.000]  Yeah, you just said it.
[12:01.140 --> 12:02.200]  So there is a different.
[12:03.200 --> 12:03.920]  Where's your hip?
[12:04.880 --> 12:05.440]  Oh, it's on.
[12:06.060 --> 12:08.660]  I don't know how to say it outside of my hip.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.360]  So it's above.
[12:11.220 --> 12:12.600]  It's the waistline, right?
[12:16.120 --> 12:18.340]  Yeah, I mean, top of the pelvis.
[12:19.020 --> 12:20.860]  Yeah, I've been pretty confident.
[12:20.980 --> 12:21.680]  I know where the hip is.
[12:21.820 --> 12:24.680]  But the hip, the hip bone is more on the side, though, isn't it?
[12:24.680 --> 12:25.640]  It's like where your leg goes in.
[12:26.440 --> 12:28.240]  It's where the leg goes in?
[12:28.520 --> 12:28.920]  Is it not?
[12:29.520 --> 12:29.920]  I don't know.
[12:29.940 --> 12:31.000]  You're asking the wrong guy.
[12:31.140 --> 12:32.540]  The pelvis is huge.
[12:32.640 --> 12:33.760]  It's a big old bastard, so.
[12:34.200 --> 12:35.280]  It's a really big bone.
[12:35.620 --> 12:36.860]  Fucking, listen, brag about it.
[12:36.880 --> 12:38.440]  Not everybody has the same pelvis size as you do.
[12:39.900 --> 12:41.800]  It doesn't make Nick any less of a man.
[12:42.200 --> 12:43.400]  A woman's pelvis is pretty different.
[12:44.100 --> 12:44.920]  It's got one less rib.
[12:47.020 --> 12:49.420]  You'd be like, man, I couldn't hit unmute fast enough for that.
[12:53.140 --> 12:58.560]  Do you ever think about, Andrew, how you assume that your skeleton is inside you,
[12:59.080 --> 13:02.080]  but really you're on the inside of your skeleton?
[13:03.420 --> 13:03.860]  What?
[13:05.220 --> 13:06.720]  Your brain is on the inside.
[13:07.860 --> 13:08.300]  Yeah.
[13:08.680 --> 13:10.740]  So your skeleton's outside of where you are.
[13:11.580 --> 13:15.980]  Well, I measure at the skin, so it's all the same.
[13:16.360 --> 13:17.900]  You exist at the skin?
[13:18.460 --> 13:21.160]  No, I'm saying it's all below the skin, so it's all inside.
[13:22.060 --> 13:23.460]  The only outside is skin.
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.320]  But on the outside of you is bone and then skin.
[13:28.140 --> 13:31.540]  Yeah, but it's still on the inside because the outside is skin.
[13:32.580 --> 13:37.340]  If you say the outside of a Snickers bar is not the chocolate, you're ridiculous.
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.100]  But there are there are different layers.
[13:39.300 --> 13:41.180]  Yeah, I kind of got to agree with Andrew here on this one.
[13:41.220 --> 13:45.780]  It doesn't really matter like where the turkey and the ham go in a club sandwich.
[13:45.860 --> 13:46.880]  They're still on the inside.
[13:47.740 --> 13:52.880]  I'm going to I'm going to chalk that one up as a point for me and the mag points point for me.
[13:53.860 --> 13:55.080]  Skin on the outside.
[13:55.300 --> 13:55.860]  But what are you?
[13:56.360 --> 13:56.820]  What am I?
[13:57.200 --> 13:58.720]  Yeah, where are you?
[13:59.700 --> 14:02.180]  I don't I don't understand what that means.
[14:02.680 --> 14:03.320]  Well, you're in your head.
[14:03.900 --> 14:05.820]  Oh, well, no, not really.
[14:05.940 --> 14:06.480]  Not right now.
[14:10.320 --> 14:13.780]  I mean, I am, but I'm not because that's an expression of you're in your head.
[14:13.900 --> 14:14.840]  God, it's the best.
[14:15.020 --> 14:19.160]  And that expression doesn't make sense if you're like, I know you're literally up in your head,
[14:19.200 --> 14:21.320]  but like, I'm not overthinking it.
[14:22.080 --> 14:22.780]  How do you think I'm under?
[14:22.900 --> 14:23.900]  I don't have to worry about over.
[14:24.440 --> 14:25.360]  I'm a big under guy.
[14:25.360 --> 14:27.520]  I think it's pretty clear you're not overthinking anything right now.
[14:29.720 --> 14:33.580]  I got to say, I love the fact that I can we can be I could be over here stressing
[14:33.580 --> 14:36.220]  because I got nothing to talk about today because we're doing back to backs.
[14:36.360 --> 14:40.000]  And then you just ask Andrew a basic general knowledge question
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.840]  and you get like 22 confusing minutes.
[14:42.480 --> 14:43.520]  It's really fascinating.
[14:43.840 --> 14:48.920]  Would you take $10,000, but you were in the shaft of your penis?
[14:49.260 --> 14:52.200]  Like that's where you were, but nothing else is different.
[14:52.760 --> 14:58.420]  Wait, so you mean like my brain is there, but I still experience everything as I do now?
[14:58.800 --> 14:58.980]  Yeah.
[14:59.660 --> 15:00.840]  Yeah, of course.
[15:01.520 --> 15:02.080]  For how long?
[15:02.720 --> 15:03.460]  Rest of your life.
[15:04.080 --> 15:04.320]  Oh.
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.660]  Oh, wait, I don't have a rib down there.
[15:08.100 --> 15:09.260]  How would you know?
[15:09.400 --> 15:10.120]  Like, why would you care?
[15:10.480 --> 15:11.720]  Do you have a brain rib?
[15:12.980 --> 15:16.840]  Do you feel like you exist in your head at the top at the top of your body, Gavin?
[15:17.120 --> 15:18.120]  Do you feel like you're sitting there?
[15:18.200 --> 15:22.100]  I think if I didn't know about the human body, I think I would assume I'm right behind my eyes.
[15:23.440 --> 15:24.820]  That's where I feel like I am.
[15:26.000 --> 15:26.400]  Interesting.
[15:26.640 --> 15:27.400]  I feel like I'm everywhere.
[15:29.020 --> 15:31.680]  If you told me I was in my car, I could protect your shaft.
[15:32.020 --> 15:34.060]  I'd be like, oh, wow, I wasn't even worrying about it.
[15:34.420 --> 15:35.320]  What if you got racked?
[15:35.920 --> 15:39.640]  Do you notice that parts of your body are more cozy than other parts?
[15:40.840 --> 15:41.640]  What do you mean?
[15:42.140 --> 15:45.140]  I've been noticing this recently with my new blanket.
[15:45.860 --> 15:50.320]  My legs feel, when I think of cozy, it's my legs are really the coat.
[15:50.320 --> 15:53.960]  Like they're really sucking in all that coziness.
[15:54.340 --> 15:58.620]  So you feel the benefits of being cozy in your legs?
[15:58.920 --> 16:01.100]  Yeah, like 90% of it is legs.
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.420]  And it could be because I'm somebody who constantly is moving their legs.
[16:05.520 --> 16:11.740]  So maybe it's the friction as opposed to I don't really move the upper half.
[16:12.280 --> 16:14.420]  Coziness to me is on the back of my shoulders.
[16:15.480 --> 16:16.060]  Really?
[16:16.060 --> 16:20.040]  Yeah, because when you like when you like pull the duvet over you and you're like,
[16:20.160 --> 16:23.640]  oh, this shit's cozy, you really you stop feeling the breeze on your back.
[16:24.940 --> 16:25.300]  Interesting.
[16:25.480 --> 16:28.640]  My legs are more passive. I don't really think about my legs.
[16:29.140 --> 16:32.580]  I'm kind of the same. If anything, my legs are the part that are always moving around
[16:32.580 --> 16:34.440]  because I'm uncomfortable and they won't sit still.
[16:34.600 --> 16:37.100]  It's the top half of me that feels cozy because it's stationary.
[16:38.320 --> 16:39.580]  Yeah, nestled in the blanket.
[16:39.960 --> 16:42.840]  I'm never thankful of a temperature change when it comes to my legs.
[16:42.980 --> 16:44.240]  I don't really worry about it.
[16:44.240 --> 16:50.720]  Well, I like I like getting the room real cold and then getting under the covers and the legs
[16:50.720 --> 16:53.760]  heating up. That's how it's a cozy feeling.
[16:53.940 --> 16:55.880]  Eric, what part of your body is the coziest?
[16:56.260 --> 16:59.040]  I don't think there's a single cozy part of my body.
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.200]  There's not a part of me that's ever comfortable or cozy.
[17:04.380 --> 17:08.780]  I see you as a cozy guy. I don't feel like you've ever been cozy.
[17:09.060 --> 17:13.460]  No, truly what you're talking about where you like you pull the duvet over and whatever
[17:13.460 --> 17:17.540]  that is not coziness. It's just a sense of relief of
[17:17.540 --> 17:22.280]  I can now flip the switch and it will be dark in my brain for the next eight hours
[17:22.280 --> 17:26.380]  until the lights come back on. Constantly on edge is absolutely right.
[17:26.480 --> 17:26.680]  Yes.
[17:27.480 --> 17:31.000]  Do you? I also feel like I really love it's not necessarily cozy,
[17:31.140 --> 17:35.560]  but if my hands are cold and I wash my hands with warm water, an amazing feeling.
[17:35.760 --> 17:36.100]  Love it.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.140]  Really?
[17:37.500 --> 17:37.780]  Yeah.
[17:38.040 --> 17:42.040]  I can find that to be jarring, but it depends, I guess.
[17:42.040 --> 17:45.960]  What is the best non-sexual feeling?
[17:46.760 --> 17:47.240]  Sneeze.
[17:49.020 --> 17:50.300]  Sneeze is really good.
[17:50.380 --> 17:57.700]  Head rub, like scalp rub like that. Have you ever had like the thing that like it's like
[17:57.700 --> 18:02.480]  I don't even know how to describe it. It like scratches your head sort of like.
[18:02.700 --> 18:02.920]  Yeah.
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.460]  It's like a spider leg looking thing.
[18:04.640 --> 18:07.220]  I like the prong thing like a whisk that's been cut open.
[18:07.220 --> 18:12.360]  Yeah, it's a. I don't know what. Oh, yeah, yeah. Here it is. It's this thing.
[18:12.580 --> 18:14.520]  It is. This is maybe.
[18:15.620 --> 18:20.800]  The best non-sexual feeling, whatever that thing is, but it's like a scalp massager.
[18:21.280 --> 18:23.400]  It's the craziest feeling in the world.
[18:23.500 --> 18:25.940]  It's like somebody cut a whisk off halfway down.
[18:26.060 --> 18:29.100]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like it's like nothing else feels like that.
[18:29.740 --> 18:30.640]  A back scratch.
[18:30.960 --> 18:31.200]  Yeah.
[18:31.480 --> 18:33.740]  So do you do that every day?
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.220]  This thing?
[18:35.560 --> 18:35.740]  Yeah.
[18:36.300 --> 18:36.660]  No.
[18:37.600 --> 18:39.300]  If it's the best thing, why aren't you doing it?
[18:40.060 --> 18:42.780]  I don't know where it is. It's around here somewhere. I don't know.
[18:43.720 --> 18:48.880]  That to me is the ultimate in. Yeah, I have one of those, but Sod knows where it is.
[18:49.040 --> 18:49.260]  Yeah.
[18:49.760 --> 18:52.720]  I don't have one, but if I feel like if I did, I would never know where that is.
[18:53.180 --> 18:57.980]  Yeah, exactly. Because it feels like when when I when it happens, I feel like that dog.
[19:00.180 --> 19:03.620]  So say your small wife was like, Eric, just come here.
[19:03.620 --> 19:07.060]  And she just tucked you into the bed and she just started using that on your head.
[19:07.120 --> 19:07.780]  Would you feel cozy?
[19:08.600 --> 19:11.520]  Yeah, I mean, I would feel asleep within 10 seconds. Yeah.
[19:11.920 --> 19:12.240]  Wow.
[19:12.300 --> 19:15.120]  So I don't know if that's cozy, but that's what that's what I would feel.
[19:16.540 --> 19:24.740]  Yeah, I went and just got a like a hair wash scalp massage thing from a place that just opened
[19:24.740 --> 19:26.840]  that I really enjoyed. Yeah, it's nice.
[19:27.220 --> 19:27.920]  Without a haircut?
[19:28.640 --> 19:32.920]  No, it was not a haircut. It was it was just that it was like scalp massage,
[19:32.920 --> 19:37.880]  hair wash thing that was like really, really nice. I like that stuff. I like
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.400]  having a time to stop and go like, oh, this thing will be taken care of for you. It's
[19:44.400 --> 19:47.740]  like, oh, that's cool. I don't have that in my life at any other time. So that's really nice.
[19:48.220 --> 19:48.860]  You're like a car.
[19:49.780 --> 19:52.320]  I'm you know what? I'm just like a car.
[19:52.420 --> 19:54.920]  You're going to a shop, you're going it's like getting your oil changed.

[20:57.980 --> 21:00.300]  Big old thanks to Shady Rays for sponsoring this episode.
[21:02.300 --> 21:04.460]  If a car had ribs, where would they be?
[21:07.000 --> 21:08.240]  Under the hood.
[21:09.100 --> 21:10.600]  I would think doors.
[21:10.920 --> 21:16.240]  It's got the, it's that cage that's underneath the engine. It's the, uh, like, you know,
[21:16.260 --> 21:20.720]  like, like new cars have, like, uh, like an undercarriage.
[21:20.800 --> 21:22.760]  Oh, to stop like scrapage and puncture.
[21:22.760 --> 21:26.880]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's like a car undercarriage guard that you can,
[21:27.120 --> 21:30.340]  that I think you can have. Like, it's, I think that's, I think that's ribs.
[21:30.520 --> 21:35.120]  It's interesting that mother nature doesn't perceive a lot of threats to be coming from
[21:35.120 --> 21:40.180]  the ground up. They always seem to be coming out towards us, you know, horizontally because
[21:40.180 --> 21:44.760]  all of our defenses are designed to defend ourselves from horizontal threats, but like
[21:44.760 --> 21:49.480]  our balls are wide open, you know, there's nothing protecting those. Bottom of your foot.
[21:49.820 --> 21:52.060]  What's soft? What's worse than stepping on a nail?
[21:53.020 --> 21:56.500]  Yep. Think about it. Birds could be dropping stuff on you. Squirrels could be dropping stuff
[21:56.500 --> 21:59.820]  on you. What are you going to do to defend that? Wear a helmet? I don't think so. I won't even
[21:59.820 --> 22:01.500]  wear one when I ride a bike. I'm too cool for that.
[22:02.020 --> 22:07.460]  Like mother nature gave us backs. Those are really strong. You can deflect a lot of, like,
[22:07.540 --> 22:11.160]  you hit somebody with a, with a baseball bat on the back. They'll probably live, you know,
[22:11.840 --> 22:17.220]  but, uh, and from the front, but man, something coming down up or up down, you're fucking boned.
[22:17.220 --> 22:19.600]  Like a killer mole. Yeah.
[22:21.000 --> 22:24.380]  Gotta watch out for those killer moles. Gotta watch out for those mole men.
[22:24.780 --> 22:29.040]  Do you think it starts getting depressing in life when you buy batteries and they expire
[22:29.040 --> 22:33.940]  after you're going to die? Well, you don't know when you're going to die.
[22:34.080 --> 22:39.220]  No, I know. If I was like, I just bought some triple A's, right? And they expire in 2038.
[22:39.980 --> 22:44.880]  That I'm going to be 50 then. Like, I can't imagine being 82 and buying batteries that expire
[22:46.160 --> 22:50.440]  in... I imagine when you're in your eighties, you buy less of stuff. Costco becomes less
[22:50.440 --> 22:55.740]  important probably. Also, are you, are you concerned about the expiry date on your batteries?
[22:56.500 --> 23:00.720]  You're certainly going to use them before. Yeah. But sometimes you glance them and you're like,
[23:00.800 --> 23:04.720]  bloody hell, that's the future. And then suddenly it's 2038 and you're like, what happened?
[23:05.100 --> 23:08.060]  That's why I always buy batteries that expire next year. Cause it's like,
[23:08.100 --> 23:13.420]  I'm outliving these. It's like a test for me. I would honestly assume every battery would outlive
[23:13.420 --> 23:18.220]  me. Like I doesn't see if it's not produce. It doesn't seem like it would expire. Yep.
[23:18.820 --> 23:22.380]  Well, they drain. I understand that, but it just like, it seems like something that would last
[23:22.380 --> 23:26.380]  forever. Like I would assume all batteries have like a hundred year shelf life. So when you hear
[23:26.380 --> 23:33.180]  the term battery life and you think, you think it's like your life. Yeah. I just, I just sort
[23:33.180 --> 23:36.920]  of challenged that. I'm just like, I hope I live longer than this battery, but at some point it's
[23:36.920 --> 23:42.840]  not going to happen. Hey, hey, Geoff, have you ever thought that sentence before? It's kind
[23:42.840 --> 23:46.640]  of a negative way to look at it. Gavin and I just playing pong on ridiculous. You know,
[23:46.700 --> 23:51.640]  I can't say that I have, but I'm not quite 50 yet. So who knows? We'll see. Gavin,
[23:51.680 --> 23:55.320]  do you have a midlife crisis when you go into a bookstore? Cause there is no expiry.
[23:55.880 --> 24:00.820]  Just a bunch of things that are intended to last. I just think it's the furthest expiration I've
[24:00.820 --> 24:05.700]  seen to the point where it's like, wow, that's really the future. Isn't it? It would be cool
[24:05.700 --> 24:09.320]  if books came with an expiration date on the knowledge in them. Like this book is going to
[24:09.320 --> 24:15.400]  be useful for the next 62 years. And then it's going to be completely outdated. Don't buy this
[24:15.400 --> 24:18.460]  book. It's going to be outdated in three years. We're going to fit. We're going to fix all this
[24:18.460 --> 24:25.020]  shit. I never think about that in the sense of like batteries and expiry dates, but I think of
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.000]  long lasting properties and then go, man, Batman is going to fight some dude that I don't know
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.240]  exists. And that's weird. Huh? I actually think that's, that's super interesting. That's way
[24:37.240 --> 24:42.680]  better than the battery thing. That's great. Let's talk about Andrew's thing that new characters
[24:42.680 --> 24:45.520]  are going to be come up with. They're going to be doing Harry Potter shit forever or whatever.
[24:45.560 --> 24:49.300]  And there's going to be a new, how does Voldemort come back again? This is crazy.
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.760]  Voldemort could do a thing that I will not know about most likely because I'll be dead at some
[24:53.760 --> 24:59.720]  point, but Harry Potter will continue to exist. Andrew, there's going to be Mario games that keep
[24:59.720 --> 25:06.340]  going crazy, right? Odyssey six is going to come out after we're toast and there's going to be a
[25:06.340 --> 25:12.680]  party game that we are just not aware of. We won't have opinions. What if someone got born today and
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.200]  they will be someone to add a Mario character to marry a pie? They'll invent it. Probably.
[25:18.160 --> 25:23.360]  Probably. I mean, that doesn't shock me or sound weird to me at all, but what kills me is the fact
[25:23.360 --> 25:29.100]  that the Boston Celtics will win championships that I won't know about. Ooh, yeah. Sport is
[25:29.100 --> 25:34.680]  where it kills me. Yeah. Pot like the Padres, there'll be a, there'll be a point where you're
[25:34.680 --> 25:39.860]  Eric, you're no longer a Padres fan because you're in the fucking ground. Oh no, I'm a Padres
[25:39.860 --> 25:44.740]  fan even in death. And then after I die, maybe they'll win their first championship. The Padres
[25:44.740 --> 25:48.420]  are going to draft some dude who's going to be the next Manny Machado and you won't know anything
[25:48.420 --> 25:52.500]  about it. I I've thought about this before because it really kind of hit me when I was in like my
[25:52.500 --> 25:57.440]  later twenties, like that when there's a draft for like baseball players or whatever, they're
[25:57.440 --> 26:03.120]  like 17 and you go, oh my God, like I'm 10 years older than this guy and it only gets worse from
[26:03.120 --> 26:09.520]  there or whatever. But I was thinking about that made me think about my dad is like a Padres fan
[26:09.520 --> 26:14.280]  and he, in his life, doesn't know what it's like to win a championship. And I'm like, man, we got
[26:14.280 --> 26:19.180]  to get one for my dad, please, please. We got to get one for my dad. Come on guys. Yeah. Do a lot
[26:19.180 --> 26:24.720]  of people's ashes still go to the games? Sometimes. Yeah, I bet. Yeah. I bet there's a lot of dead
[26:24.720 --> 26:30.480]  people at each game. Yeah. But like you have to think about like the way sports work now compared
[26:30.480 --> 26:38.780]  to how it used to be, like where the Chargers used to play when they were in San Diego is
[26:38.780 --> 26:48.420]  demolished and they put a new stadium there that isn't for the Chargers. So your ashes are rooting
[26:48.420 --> 26:56.880]  for a soccer team now, I guess. It's like some apartments and a soccer team. You mean if the
[26:56.880 --> 27:03.400]  were left there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like there'd be nothing worse than being in a stadium
[27:03.400 --> 27:10.500]  with a bunch of ghosts that are a fan of a team for like 80 years that have never won. Yeah. Just
[27:10.500 --> 27:16.960]  the most annoying. Never going to happen. Never going to happen. That's the worst echo chamber
[27:16.960 --> 27:23.340]  ever. Christ. It's just a thing, too, where it's like dead Chargers fans got their ashes sprinkled
[27:23.340 --> 27:30.360]  in Jack Murphy Stadium and now it's demolished. It's a trolley stop, some apartments and a stadium
[27:30.360 --> 27:37.100]  for an MLS team. I can't think of anything a Chargers fan wanted less than the 80s. Then what
[27:37.100 --> 27:44.400]  the fuck is MLS? Love it. Love it. Now you're eternally a soccer fan, dickhead. Oh, that's
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.660]  great. I take comfort in knowing my team will never win after I die, but I just don't have to
[27:49.660 --> 27:57.680]  care anymore. That's the joy. What? Because my, my, my Canucks that have never won, when I die,
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.900]  if they still haven't won, I'm just going under the assumption they never will. And that's OK
[28:02.900 --> 28:08.720]  because I'm dead and I can just, I'm at peace. They're never going to win. I think I'd rather,
[28:09.220 --> 28:15.340]  I guess like in a curse sense, I'd rather they continue to never win than to eventually win
[28:15.340 --> 28:19.580]  without me getting to see what that looks like or feel it. You never want your team to win.
[28:19.660 --> 28:25.120]  Cause you'll be dead. At the point in which I'm dead. Yes. Currently very much want them to win,
[28:25.420 --> 28:32.360]  actively cheering for win, but on my deathbed that will swing hard in the opposite way.
[28:32.740 --> 28:38.960]  What sport is this? Hockey. If you could, would you want your ashes to be made into a puck?
[28:39.540 --> 28:46.560]  No. Well, maybe if they weren't affiliated with the Canucks. Oh. What if you were the winning
[28:46.560 --> 28:53.700]  puck? Like the Canadians maybe? Or like the Bruins? You want to be a Bruins puck? No. Maybe
[28:53.700 --> 28:59.700]  like Florida. Florida Panthers. You going to be a Panther puck? Yeah, I'll be a Panther puck.
[29:00.060 --> 29:05.140]  Florida Panthers? They're stacked. They're such a good team. They're well managed.
[29:06.140 --> 29:10.640]  I'll be OK for a while. I guess I'm, you know, I'm really forecasting into the future of what
[29:10.640 --> 29:15.740]  team will be good then. But they got, Florida has a tax advantage and that isn't going away, so.
[29:15.740 --> 29:22.540]  Oh, they should always be good. So we're. Yeah, I'm thinking about my death. Florida has a tax
[29:22.540 --> 29:26.060]  advantage, so I think I'm going to go with that. Well, for signing players. I think I'm going to
[29:26.060 --> 29:29.460]  go with that. They're incentivized to sign there because they make more of their money. They have
[29:29.460 --> 29:39.380]  to give less of it away. Hell yeah, brother. Go, go Panthers. It's going to be my heel turn on my
[29:39.380 --> 29:49.360]  deathbed. Those were my last words. Go Panthers. Swap it up a little bit. If you could know,
[29:49.880 --> 29:56.440]  OK, imagine if you get killed by someone in the future. Imagine if you could just hear
[29:56.440 --> 30:00.660]  a foghorn or something the second that they're born. Would you want to hear it or not?
[30:01.920 --> 30:09.160]  Wait, wait, explain that again. So say the way you die is like a drunk driver plows into you
[30:09.160 --> 30:15.260]  when you're 70. They're like, they're like 23. Jesus, dude. Give it a scenario. But one day,
[30:15.900 --> 30:20.980]  you just wake up and you hear plong and it's the person who kills you has just been born.
[30:21.420 --> 30:25.380]  Would you want that or not? I feel like you don't. It doesn't even need to be a person,
[30:25.460 --> 30:29.680]  right? Because I feel like with death in general, there's like a series of events, the body.
[30:30.420 --> 30:35.060]  There's always like a lead. It's not sudden. It's not immediate, I don't think, for the most part.
[30:35.620 --> 30:38.820]  What do you mean? In a car crash? Well, yeah, but like a car crash,
[30:38.820 --> 30:45.560]  it could be when the car gets born. No, but let's say you're not going to get into a parked car
[30:45.560 --> 30:50.160]  and then it immediately crash. You're driving somewhere. So the horn could blow when you sit
[30:50.160 --> 30:57.300]  in the car and then you have to factor in, is it because of a crash? You would also hear a real
[30:57.300 --> 31:03.780]  foghorn. What do you mean? You'd have to be by the ocean, wouldn't you? No, you're not understanding
[31:03.780 --> 31:10.920]  my point. You're connecting this death horn to a person. I'm saying it doesn't have to be. It
[31:10.920 --> 31:16.320]  could be anything because there's almost always a lead into however you die, whether it's at the
[31:16.320 --> 31:23.840]  hands of somebody else, whether it's medical related, like there is a build to it. That's
[31:23.840 --> 31:29.420]  all I'm saying. It doesn't need to be a person. No, but I'm saying if there's a person who causes
[31:29.420 --> 31:34.840]  it, you'd hear the horn. Now that is interesting. Do you know, like the person has, do you hear the
[31:34.840 --> 31:39.200]  horn and you're like, okay, the person has been born. Do you know you now have a 23 year countdown
[31:39.200 --> 31:43.200]  until they kill you? Or do you know that sometime in the future they kill you? You just know that
[31:43.200 --> 31:48.540]  they're out there. It would be cool if you hear that horn and you know, like some piece of
[31:48.540 --> 31:53.440]  information, like a first name and the state they're born in. And then if you can track them
[31:53.440 --> 31:59.320]  down and kill them before they kill you, you change history. It's like giving you a fighting
[31:59.320 --> 32:04.880]  chance. I'm with Gavin. It has to be as vague as possible. You just have to know that now you live
[32:04.880 --> 32:11.400]  your life under like ominous circumstances. I'd have a knife on me. I'd be ready to kill the person. I know
[32:11.400 --> 32:17.200]  somebody's looking to kill me. Looking to kill you. You've got to think of it as well. You'd have
[32:17.200 --> 32:20.980]  quite some time before they'd be capable of accidentally killing you or on purpose. You assume.
[32:21.560 --> 32:26.120]  I think you'd at least have five years of chilling out. Why? A baby could crawl into the street and
[32:26.120 --> 32:29.860]  you have to avoid the baby and you drive your car right off a cliff. You don't know.
[32:30.140 --> 32:35.500]  A baby could be patient zero for some new pandemic that's going to wipe you out first.
[32:35.600 --> 32:43.940]  Dude, imagine somebody's born and a million fog horns go off. I didn't even consider that.
[32:44.560 --> 32:47.460]  You would have to ask other people like, hey, did you guys listen to the fog horn?
[32:47.660 --> 32:48.960]  Yeah, it would be a subreddit.
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.720]  It's going to be a thing where when there's an earthquake in LA, it's everyone tweeting
[32:54.720 --> 32:58.840]  earthquake, earthquake. Did you feel an earthquake, dude? Whoa. Can you imagine if
[32:58.840 --> 33:01.760]  somebody's like, did you see a foghorn? You're like, no, you gotta be like, I gotta get the
[33:01.760 --> 33:11.000]  fuck away from this guy, though. Oh, man. Wow. Kind of scary. Yeah, I don't want it.
[33:11.100 --> 33:16.600]  I wouldn't want to know. Well, I'm just going to start playing foghorns randomly around Gavin's
[33:16.600 --> 33:24.280]  house. It's such a good idea. Didn't enlist Meg into this? Well, time is permanent, right? Like
[33:24.280 --> 33:30.840]  we can't change the track. Will I entropy? Hold on. Well, like, OK, so you're creating
[33:30.840 --> 33:35.480]  a scenario in which, you know, something that's happening in the future, but.
[33:36.860 --> 33:41.300]  Everything we we're on a track, right? Essentially, you say we're everything
[33:41.300 --> 33:47.680]  that will happen has happened. Is that a thing? Theoretically, you say you can't change anything.
[33:47.960 --> 33:52.880]  Are you positing that time is a flat circle? I think that was true, detective. I was thinking
[33:52.880 --> 34:00.360]  of devs, the show devs, which is about alternate realities and like the premise of like you can't
[34:00.360 --> 34:06.140]  change. Like if you're if something is supposed, I guess I'm sort of also touching on Charlie and
[34:06.140 --> 34:11.720]  Desmond and season three lost. Charlie's going to die. Nothing like Desmond can delay it, but it's
[34:11.720 --> 34:17.180]  yeah, it's it's destined. Yeah, he's the constant. Yeah, yeah. This is this is supposed to happen.
[34:17.300 --> 34:22.360]  Touching on nature, nurture and like free will versus fate, you know? Yeah. It'd be interesting
[34:22.360 --> 34:30.360]  if if let's just get rid of that concept. And every time you're in a scenario that you could die,
[34:30.600 --> 34:35.940]  you got a horn that was like a 24 hour horn. And if you survive the next 24 hours,
[34:35.960 --> 34:41.760]  you know that whatever you did was not the path you could have taken that would have resulted
[34:41.760 --> 34:46.040]  in your death. But every way you could die, you would hear a horn constantly. It would constantly
[34:46.040 --> 34:54.560]  be horny. Yeah, guys, I'm so horny right now. I could trip getting up from this fucking table
[34:54.560 --> 35:00.260]  and hit my head and just such a way to kill myself. You get born and you hear a fog horn.
[35:00.380 --> 35:07.720]  And yeah, OK. Oh, I could choke on a triple A battery that has a future date on it. And yeah,
[35:07.780 --> 35:12.800]  and it doesn't even it doesn't even expire until 2086. Shit. Hell, Gavin's cats could breathe a
[35:14.420 --> 35:18.300]  boomerang. I was really thinking about life as a telltale game where there's only like three
[35:18.300 --> 35:24.200]  different paths. Yeah, either ors. It'd be interesting to know how many times you evaded
[35:24.200 --> 35:28.760]  death by the end of your life. Do you think you're on the good path right now? Well, it feels like
[35:28.760 --> 35:32.480]  any time you're up, you're close to a death. There'd be a quick time event. You'd see, you'd
[35:32.480 --> 35:39.060]  know, you'd have to mash axobots. Have you ever done anything? I guess like chopping like like
[35:39.060 --> 35:43.360]  vegetables is the closest I can think of of what would feel like a real life quick time event.
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.540]  But not like death related. You know, nothing death related. No, no, no, no, no, no. I've
[35:49.540 --> 35:57.180]  never had to like chisel my way out of ice that I was stuck underneath. I'm trying to think like
[35:57.180 --> 36:01.460]  physical actions, maybe running away from something, I guess. You never had to like
[36:01.460 --> 36:07.700]  tap X three times and then hold Y to fend off a zombie in the parking lot. No, zero zombie
[36:07.700 --> 36:12.580]  experiences. Have you ever like felt like you just avoided death? Like if you're on a bike and
[36:12.580 --> 36:17.840]  you you had like a real fast front tire wobble, you're like, wow, and you almost went. Most of
[36:17.840 --> 36:25.060]  the time. That would have been bad. Constantly, all day. I had a dream that I thought I died.
[36:25.960 --> 36:33.100]  That was weird. Oh, like a very like vivid, clear dream. So what were you, a ghost or you were a
[36:33.540 --> 36:38.460]  No, I was me. I was me in the dream and I died in the dream. But then what? And the last part of
[36:38.460 --> 36:46.440]  the dream was accepting my death. And then I woke up. As what, though? Me. I think you might be dead
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.100]  because I'm pretty sure if you die in a dream, you die in real life. That's what they say, right?
[36:51.440 --> 36:54.700]  Yeah. How are you coming to terms with the fact that you died if you were dead?
[36:55.380 --> 37:00.920]  No, no, I wasn't dead yet. You just said you died. In the dream I died. No, I know you didn't
[37:00.920 --> 37:07.920]  die in real life. I think you did. It was the act of dying. The dream was the act of dying.
[37:08.200 --> 37:12.700]  Yeah. And then you had to come to terms with it. After post death.
[37:14.100 --> 37:18.220]  No, because. OK, well, I was like on the gold line of death and then I woke up.
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.880]  OK, so you were just like your final breath. I was sitting in my bed,
[37:23.020 --> 37:27.940]  in my room and everything was normal. I didn't realize I was dreaming. And then
[37:28.920 --> 37:34.980]  I had like a severe heart attack or my heart stopped and I fell to my side.
[37:35.060 --> 37:41.580]  Jesus Christ, this is awful. And I was thought I can't yell for help and I don't have a phone
[37:41.580 --> 37:48.100]  near me. I guess this is I guess I'm dead. Holy Jesus. And then I woke up and I went,
[37:48.220 --> 37:55.160]  oh, that was a dream. OK, but I went through the process of like evaluating. It was very
[37:55.160 --> 37:59.960]  it was not a great dream. It was an odd experience. Can you start wearing a health
[37:59.960 --> 38:04.100]  tracker at night? Because I'm worried that your heart had some sort of palpitation.
[38:04.220 --> 38:09.220]  It affected your dream. Yeah, I don't I don't know. I'm doing good now. I got a masked up.
[38:09.260 --> 38:14.000]  I'm having a good sleep. How is that CPAP working for you? Not right now. Not great because I need
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.540]  the mask is not good. I need to figure out the mask. Oh, no. The mask keeps blasting off. Last
[38:19.540 --> 38:24.660]  night I kept waking up with it on the floor. So I think I'm taking it off because it's shooting off
[38:24.660 --> 38:29.000]  and then I'm taking it off and then not remembering that sleep amnesia. Do you not hear
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.700]  the machine going ape shit, though, if the mask's off? I think I'm either sleeping or like the air.
[38:35.960 --> 38:42.300]  It's it's it's farting air pretty frequently. Here's the problem I'm currently having is I'll
[38:42.300 --> 38:48.840]  put it on my face and because of the size of my head, if I tighten the straps all the way,
[38:48.840 --> 38:55.240]  they pop off because it's just my my head is larger than the tightness of the grip of the
[38:55.240 --> 39:02.780]  thing isn't strong enough. So I have to just have like a less, less tight thing. And then with the
[39:02.780 --> 39:09.100]  air, I can feel the air blowing into the like because it's a mask, I feel blowing into the mask
[39:09.100 --> 39:16.280]  and with each blow, it feels like it's slowly coming off of my face. OK, like it's pushing
[39:16.280 --> 39:22.160]  up, like it's floating, it's filling with air. And so I think I'm falling asleep before that
[39:22.160 --> 39:27.960]  fully happens and then it lifts off my face at some point. And in a sleep state, I'm just
[39:27.960 --> 39:33.300]  taking off the mask because it's blasting. Yeah, I think just try a different, a bigger one.
[39:33.760 --> 39:38.620]  There is no bigger one. That's the problem. What do you mean there's no bigger one?
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.800]  There's got to be a bigger one. I've looked. Well, no, it's like hats. It's like this is
[39:42.800 --> 39:47.620]  large. There's no way the largest mask strap won't go around your head.
[39:48.000 --> 39:53.340]  It's the infrastructure of it. So I got a different mask. The problem is the the vent
[39:53.340 --> 39:58.300]  thing is on the back of it. And I don't know how that'll work necessarily with how I sleep.
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.720]  So I got to test it. But I just there weren't instructions on how to strap it.
[40:02.800 --> 40:06.680]  So I bet I could go over there and attach that thing properly to your head.
[40:07.060 --> 40:08.900]  Maybe. Yeah, I'll do it when I tuck you in.
[40:10.820 --> 40:12.440]  I'll be a part of the tucking in ritual.
[40:12.700 --> 40:15.940]  Obviously, I'll tuck in your legs first, so you feel maximum cozy.
[40:18.820 --> 40:22.360]  Just don't don't tuck in the sheet. I like I like to move the legs.
[40:23.200 --> 40:24.480]  I don't want to feel trapped.
[40:24.620 --> 40:27.660]  Eric has posted a picture of a full face mask.
[40:27.780 --> 40:28.920]  Yeah, I've seen the eyes.
[40:30.560 --> 40:31.720]  Is that real?
[40:32.060 --> 40:33.000]  It is real.
[40:33.280 --> 40:34.200]  Yeah. Yeah.
[40:34.200 --> 40:35.520]  Why would you want your eyes in there?
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.600]  We got it, dude. You gotta get these. This rocks.
[40:38.900 --> 40:43.560]  When I was looking at different sizes, I came across that and people were like,
[40:43.580 --> 40:45.340]  nobody's able to use those.
[40:45.480 --> 40:48.260]  Don't get one of those. Those don't work.
[40:48.580 --> 40:50.920]  What do you mean? This woman looks like she's having a blast.
[40:51.960 --> 40:53.020]  Very much awake.
[40:55.460 --> 40:57.340]  Because she got such a good night's sleep.
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.660]  I'm leaking a lot of oxygen through my eyes. Is there a CPAP mask for me?
[41:04.800 --> 41:07.760]  Wouldn't that just be like batting your eyelashes around constantly?
[41:09.100 --> 41:11.120]  I yeah, I feel like it would be pretty uncomfortable.
[41:11.460 --> 41:13.960]  Keeps night spiders from crawling into your eyes, though.
[41:14.440 --> 41:15.520]  Not if they climb into the machine.
[41:16.240 --> 41:20.460]  Oh yeah, then there's no escape because they go to the machine and it's sucked onto your face.
[41:20.620 --> 41:21.720]  Yeah, they would shoot down your throat.
[41:21.960 --> 41:24.020]  And then you get to see the night spiders come in. Oh no.
[41:25.080 --> 41:27.060]  Yeah, that would be a problem because the way
[41:27.800 --> 41:31.560]  the way that my mask currently works is the bottom half is like magnetized.
[41:31.640 --> 41:33.900]  You just snap that off and then you can easily lift it.
[41:34.420 --> 41:37.200]  That's a tough mask to immediately remove.
[41:37.360 --> 41:37.760]  Hard to get out.
[41:37.760 --> 41:39.780]  Yeah, it's a tough escape.
[41:40.280 --> 41:43.000]  I can't believe you dreamt you just died of a heart attack.
[41:43.920 --> 41:46.800]  It was like the most vivid dream I've ever had.
[41:46.880 --> 41:48.800]  It was very it was a bad coma.
[41:48.960 --> 41:49.520]  Was it painful?
[41:50.060 --> 41:53.880]  No, I was just in my room. I was sitting and then I fell to my side.
[41:54.460 --> 41:55.700]  I was like, oh, it's over.
[41:56.300 --> 41:57.840]  That really bummed me out.
[41:58.540 --> 41:59.480]  Yeah, it wasn't fun.
[42:02.380 --> 42:04.300]  We're good now. I got my ribs.
[42:05.860 --> 42:07.680]  Oh Christ, what a weird episode.
[42:08.160 --> 42:10.540]  Like 10 ribs, right? How many ribs do I got?
[42:11.300 --> 42:12.420]  I think you got 12 on each side.
[42:13.200 --> 42:15.900]  I got 12 on each side? There's no way I got 12 on each side.
[42:15.980 --> 42:17.380]  The top ones are pretty small.
[42:18.060 --> 42:19.980]  Let's look at this. Oh, yeah, I got no 10.
[42:20.180 --> 42:23.400]  Oh, no, wait, they're counting those as 11 and 12 in the back.
[42:26.920 --> 42:29.040]  You don't you don't consider that you don't count those?
[42:29.700 --> 42:30.880]  I mean, they're pretty shit ribs.
[42:32.140 --> 42:33.060]  What's shit about them?
[42:33.540 --> 42:34.640]  They're so small.
[42:34.880 --> 42:36.160]  They only they need to be small.
[42:36.300 --> 42:38.700]  That's the space they're fixing or they're protecting.
[42:38.700 --> 42:42.620]  If you ordered ribs at a restaurant and they brought you 11 or 12.
[42:43.020 --> 42:46.920]  When you if you ordered human ribs at a restaurant, one through 10.
[42:48.300 --> 42:52.200]  I imagine other animals ribs are equally shifting.
[42:53.300 --> 42:55.320]  What does a cow's ribs look like?
[42:55.460 --> 42:57.340]  Boy, I thought you were about to say cat.
[42:57.440 --> 43:00.960]  I thought you were saying cat ribs and I was going to fucking flip.
[43:01.280 --> 43:03.960]  Uh, never. You don't eat cat ribs.
[43:05.700 --> 43:08.240]  But I eat a cow ribs, I eat pork ribs.
[43:09.260 --> 43:12.100]  What does a pig's rib cage look like or a cow?
[43:12.640 --> 43:14.820]  It looks like a big looks like a big rib cage.
[43:14.840 --> 43:16.360]  Wow. OK, so it's less of a variance.
[43:17.380 --> 43:19.200]  Those cows are typically pretty big.
[43:21.860 --> 43:23.240]  Pigs. Less big.
[43:23.760 --> 43:26.420]  Pigs less big, but big still with ribs.
[43:26.740 --> 43:27.760]  Yeah, still middle.
[43:27.940 --> 43:28.560]  Pigs are pretty uniform.
[43:29.360 --> 43:32.060]  Now, see, pigs and cows, pigs and cows,
[43:32.060 --> 43:35.860]  they are protected from the bottom and the side, unlike humans.
[43:36.060 --> 43:36.440]  Interesting.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.880]  Wait, that pig image, that diagram has blown my mind.
[43:40.360 --> 43:40.560]  OK.
[43:40.780 --> 43:42.500]  The ham is just the back of the pig.
[43:43.460 --> 43:44.740]  Uh, let's have a look.
[43:44.800 --> 43:46.880]  Like a cartoon ham is just a pig's ass?
[43:47.440 --> 43:48.180]  Yeah, it's an anus.
[43:48.680 --> 43:50.980]  Well, it's like a cheek and a leg, yeah.
[43:51.320 --> 43:53.620]  Yeah. Yeah, it's just it's the hock, right?
[43:53.660 --> 43:55.320]  It's like the yeah, the hock's down there.
[43:55.960 --> 43:58.160]  The foot's called the trotter. That's fun.
[43:58.560 --> 43:58.760]  Yeah.
[43:58.760 --> 44:02.680]  Uh, but yeah, the ham is just like the yeah, it's the ass.
[44:02.840 --> 44:05.640]  I've never seen a picture of a ham inside the pig.
[44:05.700 --> 44:06.960]  That's crazy to me.
[44:07.720 --> 44:09.060]  Baby back ribs.
[44:10.120 --> 44:11.080]  And there's a cat.
[44:12.440 --> 44:13.580]  I don't look at that one.
[44:16.380 --> 44:17.680]  For some reason.
[44:18.120 --> 44:20.860]  How come their feet aren't called trotters?
[44:21.520 --> 44:24.440]  Wait, the heels, although the heels like the back knee.
[44:24.720 --> 44:25.360]  So what's the bit?
[44:25.360 --> 44:30.020]  You just give Gavin a picture of animals and he's got a lot of questions.
[44:30.460 --> 44:31.580]  I didn't realize all of that.
[44:31.960 --> 44:33.460]  So the foot goes like halfway up the.
[44:34.980 --> 44:37.300]  What's the what's the pivot point at the paw then?
[44:37.580 --> 44:38.640]  What's the back of that, not a heel?
[44:39.180 --> 44:41.160]  Yeah, Gavin or Geoff, what is it?
[44:41.760 --> 44:42.680]  What are you asking me for?
[44:42.800 --> 44:43.660]  It's what?
[44:44.660 --> 44:44.880]  What?
[44:45.220 --> 44:47.020]  What's the pivot point at the what, the where?
[44:47.340 --> 44:49.800]  The paw, like the where, like where the heel would be.
[44:49.800 --> 44:50.420]  Oh, the metatarsal.
[44:51.280 --> 44:52.200]  Well, that's like the.
[44:52.840 --> 44:53.560]  Toe bones.
[44:54.380 --> 44:55.920]  It's the same as your toes.
[44:56.600 --> 44:58.740]  Yeah, but my heel doesn't go halfway up my leg.
[44:58.800 --> 45:00.920]  Well, it's because they have a longer heel than you do.
[45:01.080 --> 45:03.840]  Doesn't mean it doesn't make your heel any less valid.
[45:04.120 --> 45:05.200]  It just means they're always on.
[45:05.440 --> 45:06.500]  They're on tippy toes.
[45:07.020 --> 45:07.200]  Yeah.
[45:07.560 --> 45:08.860]  Yeah, they're a little high heels.
[45:08.980 --> 45:09.860]  They're like ballerinas.
[45:10.280 --> 45:10.460]  Yeah.
[45:10.800 --> 45:13.680]  Oh, I also found this image, but it makes the cat look evil.
[45:15.020 --> 45:16.300]  It's like scary.
[45:17.320 --> 45:17.920]  Oh, shit.
[45:18.020 --> 45:18.580]  Cats are scary.
[45:19.420 --> 45:21.460]  That looks like the cat from Mouse Hunt.
[45:23.600 --> 45:24.400]  You're right.
[45:25.240 --> 45:26.120]  The evil cat.
[45:26.160 --> 45:28.040]  You know, while we're talking about animals,
[45:28.220 --> 45:30.560]  can I ask you guys a question that I have in my dregs list?
[45:30.940 --> 45:31.200]  Yeah.
[45:31.740 --> 45:34.840]  My wife presented this to me and I didn't have a good answer for her.
[45:35.680 --> 45:37.680]  You guys, you know how we eat chicken eggs?
[45:37.960 --> 45:39.140]  It's like a big thing right now, right?
[45:39.140 --> 45:41.720]  Because eggs are so expensive and it's become a big political sticking point.
[45:42.060 --> 45:44.060]  We eat ostrich eggs sometimes.
[45:44.200 --> 45:44.960]  There's quail eggs.
[45:45.060 --> 45:47.140]  A lot of different eggs turn into food, right?
[45:48.420 --> 45:50.280]  Why don't we eat turkey eggs?
[45:52.600 --> 45:54.020]  I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[45:54.760 --> 45:56.300]  Maybe like they're really small?
[45:56.660 --> 45:57.440]  They're not.
[45:57.940 --> 45:58.440]  Oh, really?
[45:58.580 --> 46:00.040]  I don't think. I think they're bigger than regular eggs.
[46:00.160 --> 46:00.900]  Oh, wow.
[46:01.080 --> 46:02.860]  Why don't we eat turkey eggs?
[46:03.160 --> 46:03.740]  Have a look.
[46:03.860 --> 46:04.440]  Oh, look at this.
[46:04.500 --> 46:04.700]  Yeah.
[46:05.280 --> 46:06.340]  Look, there's a turkey egg.
[46:06.380 --> 46:06.860]  It looks delicious.
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.180]  I know people go ham on duck eggs.
[46:09.420 --> 46:10.440]  It's a little bit bigger than duck.
[46:10.500 --> 46:11.420]  I know people eat duck.
[46:11.720 --> 46:13.220]  Should we have a turkey fry-up?
[46:14.260 --> 46:16.520]  Turkey, turkeys lay eggs less frequently.
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.140]  Oh, making them less common and more expensive.
[46:20.140 --> 46:22.400]  But they're edible and similar in taste.
[46:22.660 --> 46:25.520]  I think chickens just lay eggs like very, very often.
[46:25.880 --> 46:27.680]  And it appears turkeys do not.
[46:27.860 --> 46:28.620]  Great question.
[46:29.380 --> 46:30.700]  I never thought about it.
[46:30.940 --> 46:31.280]  Great question.
[46:31.560 --> 46:33.500]  Does a turkey only lay a fertilized egg?
[46:34.460 --> 46:36.060]  Or they also plop out like cyclical eggs?
[46:36.060 --> 46:39.480]  I think they plop out unfertilized eggs, yeah.
[46:39.980 --> 46:44.500]  So how often is a turkey's lay... egg lay?
[46:48.280 --> 46:48.840]  Just...
[46:48.840 --> 46:52.320]  One clutch of eggs per year.
[46:52.820 --> 46:57.860]  A clutch consists of roughly 10 to 12 eggs laid over a period of about two weeks.
[46:58.220 --> 46:59.080]  Oh, so there you go.
[46:59.160 --> 46:59.600]  That's why.
[46:59.660 --> 47:01.040]  Yeah, they really barely lay eggs.
[47:01.540 --> 47:03.040]  So they have like an annual period?
[47:03.560 --> 47:04.120]  Yeah.
[47:04.200 --> 47:07.320]  And it looks like chickens can start producing eggs.
[47:08.080 --> 47:11.820]  It says chicken production, they come into production 19 or 20 weeks.
[47:11.980 --> 47:14.700]  A turkey takes 32 weeks before it's laying eggs.
[47:14.700 --> 47:16.560]  So everything about a turkey just takes longer.
[47:17.440 --> 47:17.480]  Interesting.
[47:18.080 --> 47:18.260]  Yeah.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.300]  I wonder what it would be like to be a sicko, a turkey egg sicko.
[47:23.900 --> 47:25.680]  Like, like you're just like, oh, I don't eat those.
[47:25.780 --> 47:26.840]  Like you're really into eggs.
[47:26.940 --> 47:28.520]  Yeah, like that's your thing.
[47:28.780 --> 47:28.940]  Yeah.
[47:29.440 --> 47:32.740]  Yeah, and there's only 12 per turkey or whatever per year.
[47:33.540 --> 47:36.720]  I feel like we gotta seek out turkey eggs.
[47:36.860 --> 47:38.600]  There's got to be something we can get our hands on and eat.
[47:38.640 --> 47:39.440]  Oh, I'm sure we can buy.
[47:39.540 --> 47:40.940]  I'm sure we can buy turkey eggs.
[47:41.100 --> 47:43.280]  I just, I think we're going to be disappointed in it.
[47:43.280 --> 47:45.500]  There's got to be like hundreds of dollars if that's all they lay.
[47:46.960 --> 47:48.840]  No, because you can have like a lot of turkeys.
[47:49.080 --> 47:52.960]  It's a, yeah, I have, here's a half dozen turkey eggs for six bucks.
[47:53.420 --> 47:55.480]  Oh, oh, that's way easier.
[47:56.100 --> 47:59.020]  I don't think they're like very sought after or crazy.
[47:59.120 --> 48:02.900]  I think it's just in terms of what's the easiest way to get this egg,
[48:02.980 --> 48:05.660]  a chicken just does everything faster than a turkey.
[48:05.720 --> 48:06.520]  I think that's all it is.
[48:06.960 --> 48:10.900]  It feels like a job to give a falcon and not a Patreon subscriber.
[48:10.900 --> 48:12.200]  I mean, a literal falcon.
[48:13.300 --> 48:16.700]  You think you should train a falcon to go get?
[48:16.840 --> 48:21.160]  It feels like a falcon should be able to go retrieve some turkey eggs.
[48:21.680 --> 48:23.260]  Yeah, I trust them for that mission.
[48:23.980 --> 48:25.860]  Why don't we eat any reptile eggs?
[48:27.180 --> 48:29.820]  That sounds gross and I don't.
[48:29.900 --> 48:30.360]  I don't know.
[48:30.400 --> 48:31.020]  I don't know why.
[48:31.060 --> 48:31.980]  Because it's also an egg.
[48:32.600 --> 48:34.800]  Yeah, but I wonder, do you think it's like a different,
[48:34.860 --> 48:36.140]  do you think it's like a softer thing?
[48:36.280 --> 48:37.420]  Like it's just like not the same?
[48:37.620 --> 48:37.760]  Ew.
[48:38.100 --> 48:38.800]  I got answers.
[48:39.240 --> 48:39.500]  Okay.
[48:39.500 --> 48:40.300]  All right.
[48:40.840 --> 48:42.340]  Why don't we eat reptile eggs?
[48:42.440 --> 48:44.840]  They are reported to be a little fishy in flavor.
[48:45.560 --> 48:48.040]  But the other reason why we don't eat it is that
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.340]  most large reptiles are endangered or protected species.
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.320]  Oh, yeah, but you could have a snake.
[48:54.700 --> 48:57.260]  Like, what if you owned a snake and then you just could have all the,
[48:57.340 --> 48:58.220]  it's like owning a chicken, right?
[48:58.380 --> 49:00.160]  It'd be fishy, I guess, like a fishy egg.
[49:02.000 --> 49:03.060]  Ew, you have a snake?
[49:03.160 --> 49:03.900]  No, no, no, no, no.
[49:03.940 --> 49:05.340]  I don't have a snake because I like snakes.
[49:05.440 --> 49:06.540]  I'm all about the eggs.
[49:06.600 --> 49:07.220]  I'm an egg guy.
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.860]  What, um, if a mammal could lay an egg, what would be the best mammal egg?
[49:13.900 --> 49:14.680]  And why is it a goat?
[49:15.400 --> 49:16.180]  I was thinking bunny.
[49:16.400 --> 49:17.940]  Oh, I don't think goat tastes that well.
[49:17.980 --> 49:20.260]  I think, I think a cow egg would be pretty amazing.
[49:20.700 --> 49:22.240]  It already makes so much great food.
[49:23.140 --> 49:25.500]  I feel like I've already taken too much from the cow though.
[49:25.940 --> 49:26.920]  Yeah, I agree.
[49:27.300 --> 49:29.580]  I like, we can't take, we can't take the cow's eggs also.
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.060]  I think it's got to be, I think it's got to be a mammal that like we don't do,
[49:35.280 --> 49:37.200]  like goat, I think is like a great answer.
[49:38.060 --> 49:38.420]  Hippo.
[49:38.420 --> 49:39.800]  I'm not doing much with a goat.
[49:39.960 --> 49:40.480]  You know what I'm saying?
[49:41.340 --> 49:41.780]  Hippopotamus.
[49:41.960 --> 49:42.480]  Oh, horse.
[49:42.640 --> 49:43.060]  Horse egg.
[49:44.100 --> 49:45.220]  People keep horses.
[49:46.180 --> 49:47.540]  Uh, people ride horses.
[49:48.120 --> 49:49.200]  Horses do tricks or whatever.
[49:49.600 --> 49:50.380]  Horses lay eggs.
[49:50.480 --> 49:52.020]  People do eat horses too.
[49:52.140 --> 49:55.680]  Yeah, see, like Gus said the best food he ever had in his entire life was horse sashimi.
[49:56.400 --> 49:57.260]  And they do glue?
[49:58.260 --> 49:59.380]  Yeah, they make glue.
[50:00.340 --> 50:01.360]  Maybe like a porcupine?
[50:02.200 --> 50:03.580]  Oh man, I don't know if that...
[50:03.580 --> 50:05.200]  Porcupine eggs seem so small.
[50:05.200 --> 50:10.240]  They would be small, but I would be convinced that they were good because of their protection.
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.080]  Oh, so the more defense...
[50:13.080 --> 50:16.960]  The more protected, yeah, the more delicious the product.
[50:17.120 --> 50:18.220]  It's like an armadillo egg.
[50:18.960 --> 50:20.900]  Oh, an armadillo egg.
[50:21.500 --> 50:23.140]  I bet raccoons would lay good eggs.
[50:23.540 --> 50:24.760]  Oh no, they give me trashy.
[50:24.800 --> 50:25.480]  They're gonna be gross.
[50:26.000 --> 50:27.700]  That's like going like, ooh, possum eggs.
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.660]  Like you're a freak, dude.
[50:28.800 --> 50:29.000]  Gross.
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.420]  No, I think it'd make it more flavorful.
[50:30.480 --> 50:33.200]  Kind of like a chicken skin, how it's all like mostly waste.
[50:33.600 --> 50:34.740]  Well, people eat catfish, don't they?
[50:34.740 --> 50:36.260]  They just suck on turd.
[50:36.460 --> 50:36.660]  It's true.
[50:36.880 --> 50:37.340]  It's true.
[50:37.900 --> 50:40.860]  I feel like a raccoon egg would be the Lunchables of the eggs.
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.400]  I could eat a Lunchable right about now.
[50:44.500 --> 50:44.920]  That sounds good.
[50:44.940 --> 50:45.520]  Hell yeah, dude.
[50:45.580 --> 50:46.180]  Let's go get some.
[50:46.680 --> 50:48.780]  Is that like a healthy grown up Lunchable?
[50:49.340 --> 50:51.280]  Isn't that what Jake Paul was making or whatever?
[50:51.920 --> 50:52.240]  No.
[50:52.740 --> 50:54.100]  No, I think they had a bunch of rot in them.
[50:54.720 --> 50:57.180]  I think it's like HelloFresh, right?
[50:57.260 --> 50:58.100]  Isn't that essentially?
[50:58.740 --> 51:00.460]  Like those meal delivery services?
[51:00.800 --> 51:01.540]  Yeah, like Factor.
[51:02.120 --> 51:02.520]  Factor?
[51:02.800 --> 51:03.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[51:05.500 --> 51:06.300]  Adult Lunchable.
[51:06.920 --> 51:08.780]  You don't got a microwave a Lunchable though.
[51:09.500 --> 51:10.220]  That's true.
[51:10.940 --> 51:12.020]  You can though, some of them.
[51:12.580 --> 51:14.580]  I think charcuterie is probably just adult Lunchables.
[51:14.720 --> 51:15.160]  I think Nick's right.
[51:15.260 --> 51:16.240]  Yeah, you know what?
[51:16.300 --> 51:17.040]  That's a good call.
[51:17.340 --> 51:24.300]  I used to eat these P3 protein packs and it was like cubed up cheddar cheese and almonds
[51:24.300 --> 51:25.960]  and then like a little bits of ham.
[51:26.520 --> 51:27.180]  Yeah, you might be right.
[51:28.080 --> 51:28.920]  How are you spelling that?
[51:30.060 --> 51:31.480]  Number three, I believe.
[51:33.080 --> 51:53.480]  A-R-C-H-A-R-C-U-T-T-E-R-E-R-E-R-Y-I-E-C-H-A-R-C-U-T-E-R-I-E.
[51:55.520 --> 51:58.200]  I'm having to do the spelling kid thing with my hand.
[51:58.300 --> 51:59.460]  I'm having to like write it out.
[51:59.780 --> 52:00.460]  You're doing great, buddy.
[52:00.840 --> 52:01.820]  You can type it.
[52:02.420 --> 52:06.380]  There needs to be a song that says charcuterie and spells it and then I'd be sad.
[52:06.620 --> 52:08.740]  Like Gwen Stefani needs to get on this.
[52:09.280 --> 52:09.760]  The Bananas.
[52:11.100 --> 52:12.780]  What was that song that Eric played the other day?
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.980]  It was like A-B-C-D-E-F-Bitch or something, what was it?
[52:21.580 --> 52:22.340]  Oh man.
[52:24.500 --> 52:25.260]  You bitch.
[52:26.140 --> 52:27.120]  Something like that, wasn't it?
[52:27.480 --> 52:30.220]  Yeah, it was A-B-C-D-E-F-Y-U.
[52:31.660 --> 52:33.020]  Yeah, sucks, sucks.
[52:37.430 --> 52:40.130]  That's just a fun activity though, adding cursing to the rhymes.
[52:40.650 --> 52:41.750]  It's pretty good.
[52:42.750 --> 52:45.510]  Andrew, we still haven't done our Technical Difficulties video.
[52:45.910 --> 52:47.330]  Oh boy, you need to.
[52:47.390 --> 52:48.070]  Because of Technical Difficulties.
[52:48.070 --> 52:49.690]  You can both stand to do it today.
[52:49.790 --> 52:51.050]  God, no fucking kidding.
[52:51.110 --> 52:54.030]  Yeah, but you've also just said you reset all of your PC.
[52:54.150 --> 52:55.210]  So do you not have any anymore?
[52:55.710 --> 52:58.610]  No, no, no, no, this is a different computer.
[52:59.070 --> 53:00.610]  Oh, good.
[53:00.610 --> 53:03.270]  The Technical Difficulties computer is the one I don't use for work.
[53:03.530 --> 53:04.330]  That was the Mac, right?
[53:04.690 --> 53:07.810]  Yeah, this is a laptop that is failing.
[53:09.630 --> 53:13.410]  Said something about the drivers not being compatible with the thing, so I
[53:14.050 --> 53:17.290]  removed the drive... well, I removed the thing that was the drivers.
[53:17.930 --> 53:18.670]  Isn't that quite new?
[53:18.770 --> 53:20.590]  Wasn't that like a Rooster Teeth thing?
[53:21.010 --> 53:24.110]  It was, yeah, but it was funky from the start.
[53:24.830 --> 53:27.530]  They modified it in some way, I don't trust whatever they did.
[53:27.590 --> 53:28.670]  It was funky from the beginning.
[53:29.290 --> 53:30.270]  Did you not have to give that back?
[53:30.890 --> 53:32.630]  Well, you hear me today.
[53:34.010 --> 53:35.430]  Probably cut this part out.
[53:36.330 --> 53:38.150]  Nobody asked me to give it back.
[53:39.110 --> 53:40.250]  Bernie didn't reach out to you?
[53:40.290 --> 53:41.290]  Not about that.
[53:43.310 --> 53:44.810]  You're about to get an email.
[53:47.710 --> 53:49.290]  I'm actually going to need that one, sorry.
[53:50.550 --> 53:52.950]  If you took away everything that I currently use,
[53:53.870 --> 53:57.370]  all I would have left is a GoXLR thing that Geoff gave me.
[53:58.910 --> 54:00.750]  And I bought that personally, I think.
[54:00.950 --> 54:02.230]  I don't think it was from the company.
[54:02.770 --> 54:03.330]  That's what I'm saying.
[54:03.870 --> 54:06.770]  You bought it, it didn't work for your setup, so I ended up with it.
[54:07.130 --> 54:07.330]  Yeah.
[54:08.750 --> 54:10.670]  Which they don't support now or something.
[54:10.790 --> 54:12.770]  I read a whole thing about how GoXLR sucks.
[54:13.390 --> 54:17.250]  Well, no, I think that TC, whatever the company's called,
[54:17.390 --> 54:18.450]  got rid of that whole department.
[54:18.650 --> 54:20.370]  So it's just unsupported.
[54:21.490 --> 54:22.250]  Yeah, perfect.
[54:24.650 --> 54:25.590]  Just bought one.
[54:26.170 --> 54:27.470]  Wait, really?
[54:28.890 --> 54:29.950]  Like a month ago?
[54:30.930 --> 54:33.470]  Oh, that was post, I think, when they fired everybody.
[54:33.610 --> 54:34.490]  That was a bad move, Nick.
[54:35.550 --> 54:36.610]  Gotta read more.
[54:41.470 --> 54:44.770]  I am so excited for us to do our Philly cheese steak out.
[54:44.930 --> 54:47.370]  I don't know when that's coming, but man, I was thinking about it yesterday.
[54:47.710 --> 54:48.330]  Good idea.
[54:48.550 --> 54:48.910]  I'm excited.
[54:49.010 --> 54:50.690]  I love how excited you are about it.
[54:51.030 --> 54:54.390]  And we just found out Kirby Lane does steaks now.
[54:54.790 --> 54:55.070]  Oh.
[54:55.070 --> 54:58.410]  So we can do a Kirby Lane kind of thing,
[54:58.470 --> 54:59.850]  and you guys can watch us from there.
[54:59.870 --> 55:00.770]  So it doesn't even have to be...
[55:00.770 --> 55:02.470]  Like, I would love to high-end steak,
[55:02.610 --> 55:06.650]  but if it's something we want to do more quickly at like a different time of day, then...
[55:06.650 --> 55:07.230]  Like diner steak?
[55:07.690 --> 55:08.230]  Yeah, right.
[55:08.290 --> 55:10.550]  You just kind of do like a Kirby Lane steak, and it's not crazy.
[55:11.170 --> 55:11.770]  Yeah, that works.
[55:12.630 --> 55:13.910]  Is there outdoor seating there?
[55:14.770 --> 55:16.390]  There is outdoor seating at Kirby Lane.
[55:16.730 --> 55:17.170]  Is there?
[55:17.690 --> 55:18.570]  Kirby Lane on Kirby Lane?
[55:19.210 --> 55:20.510]  No, Kirby Lane on...
[55:21.370 --> 55:21.930]  Mueller Kirby Lane?
[55:22.050 --> 55:22.750]  In Mueller, yeah.
[55:22.750 --> 55:24.850]  We could stake out the Kirby Lane on Mueller.
[55:25.050 --> 55:26.010]  We can do that for sure.
[55:26.630 --> 55:27.370]  Yeah, I think...
[55:27.370 --> 55:30.250]  Are we going to be parked, or are we going to be on the move?
[55:30.370 --> 55:31.810]  Like, are we going to try and get different...
[55:31.810 --> 55:33.030]  I think that's up to you guys.
[55:33.430 --> 55:34.710]  I think we'll just have to see...
[55:34.710 --> 55:35.330]  We'll see how we feel.
[55:35.590 --> 55:36.790]  See how we feel, yeah.
[55:36.810 --> 55:39.350]  We'll be listening in live, and we'll be able to see from our car.
[55:39.750 --> 55:43.070]  And then we need to get these binoculars that record what we see, too.
[55:43.170 --> 55:44.350]  Yeah, I'll look into that.
[55:44.370 --> 55:46.950]  Is that a real thing, or did you guys like make that up?
[55:47.130 --> 55:48.210]  Yeah, I was about to ask.
[55:48.430 --> 55:50.250]  Oh, I mean, it's got to be a real thing.
[55:50.410 --> 55:51.030]  It's 2025.
[55:51.190 --> 55:51.650]  Okay, all right.
[55:52.170 --> 55:52.930]  Let's search it.
[55:52.930 --> 55:55.830]  If there's a fork that squirts ketchup onto the food in my fork...
[55:55.830 --> 55:58.970]  Well, here's the thing, it doesn't exist.
[55:59.210 --> 56:00.690]  That's not a thing, because they failed.
[56:02.090 --> 56:03.510]  I'm pretty sure this exists.
[56:04.850 --> 56:06.330]  Binoculars that record...
[56:06.330 --> 56:07.470]  Recording binoculars.
[56:08.030 --> 56:08.430]  Video.
[56:09.190 --> 56:11.970]  I mean, if not, I'll just get a long lens and put it on my camera, and it's the same thing.
[56:12.310 --> 56:14.190]  Oh, 4K night vision binoculars?
[56:16.370 --> 56:18.210]  Why don't you use the binoculars, Geoff?
[56:18.210 --> 56:21.130]  And I'll just use a really long lens.
[56:21.650 --> 56:22.230]  That's fine.
[56:22.290 --> 56:23.450]  I got a pair of binoculars right here.
[56:23.570 --> 56:25.050]  I'm excited to dust them off.
[56:25.330 --> 56:25.830]  Okay.
[56:26.590 --> 56:27.830]  That sounds really good.
[56:30.770 --> 56:33.730]  This, this looks like something from the 90s.
[56:33.930 --> 56:34.650]  Yeah, it does.
[56:34.750 --> 56:37.130]  It looks like a spy toy for a kid.
[56:37.170 --> 56:37.890]  Looks like a talk boy.
[56:39.010 --> 56:42.570]  That's what I'll be using.
[56:43.410 --> 56:43.910]  Incognito.
[56:46.110 --> 56:46.950]  How crazy.
[56:47.330 --> 56:48.470]  That would be good for bird watching.
[56:49.250 --> 56:49.990]  Bit of ornithology.
[56:49.990 --> 56:55.550]  But what if, Geoff, instead of your car, we get a van that has like a camera advert on the side
[56:55.550 --> 56:59.190]  and a little hole cut out, so we're actually filming through the camera lens.
[57:00.030 --> 57:04.410]  That's a good idea, but it may be more doable to get just a van
[57:05.290 --> 57:07.590]  that doesn't have that other component to it.
[57:07.650 --> 57:08.490]  We could rent one.
[57:08.950 --> 57:09.350]  Yeah.
[57:09.590 --> 57:11.350]  And we'd be like 80% of the way there.
[57:11.410 --> 57:14.990]  If we wanted to be clever, we could get like a decal made and throw it on the side.
[57:15.010 --> 57:17.730]  But usually when you're doing a, when you're doing a stakeout,
[57:17.810 --> 57:19.730]  you don't advertise that you're doing a stakeout.
[57:19.730 --> 57:21.250]  Probably like a plumber's van.
[57:21.630 --> 57:24.510]  No, I know, but if you saw a picture of a camera on the side of a van,
[57:24.590 --> 57:26.270]  you wouldn't think, oh, that's a real camera.
[57:27.330 --> 57:31.950]  I probably think, yeah, I'm not sure what you, what I'm, I don't know.
[57:32.030 --> 57:35.110]  When I go to when I go to an old house, any picture I see,
[57:35.190 --> 57:37.130]  I assume the eyes are cut out and people are watching.
[57:39.550 --> 57:43.070]  It's like the idea of an advert of a camera coming on TV.
[57:45.990 --> 57:47.890]  What if, OK, there's no hole in the van,
[57:47.890 --> 57:51.510]  but we make it, we get a U-Haul and we put a little living room in there
[57:51.510 --> 57:55.630]  so we can climb into that and just sit on a couch while we do the stakeout.
[57:55.850 --> 57:58.550]  So you guys do that and then me and Nick eat steaks.
[57:59.030 --> 58:01.030]  Hey, honestly, I say go for it.
[58:01.710 --> 58:03.910]  I also like this idea.
[58:04.350 --> 58:06.910]  Yeah, I'm all for it. Yeah, yeah, do it.
[58:06.990 --> 58:08.590]  And then also me and Nick will go eat steaks.
[58:08.730 --> 58:10.970]  If you guys are doing that, we're getting a better steak place.
[58:12.250 --> 58:13.930]  Wait, why does that up the cost of the steak?
[58:14.270 --> 58:16.030]  Because I don't like that you're so comfortable
[58:16.990 --> 58:18.910]  with with me eating diner steak.
[58:19.010 --> 58:21.650]  Like the more comfortable you are, the better steak I should be able to get.
[58:22.670 --> 58:24.030]  Just go to Perry's or something.
[58:24.130 --> 58:27.190]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we're really like you're kind of like
[58:27.690 --> 58:30.170]  if you're just in Geoff's car, we'll go to Kirby Lane.
[58:30.250 --> 58:33.990]  But if you got a living room in the back of a U-Haul, we're going somewhere nice.
[58:33.990 --> 58:37.450]  I don't want I don't want them going to a nice steak place.
[58:37.470 --> 58:42.270]  So what if we what if we we get the van, we nix the U-Haul,
[58:42.270 --> 58:46.390]  so we're still less comfortable, but we get newspapers,
[58:46.390 --> 58:48.750]  which I think still exist in some markets.
[58:49.010 --> 58:51.310]  Yeah, and we cut out holes in the middle of the newspaper.
[58:51.630 --> 58:53.450]  Yeah, that's where we view through.
[58:53.770 --> 58:59.070]  If we instead get a tandem bicycle, what kind of shit do they have to eat?
[59:00.570 --> 59:01.930]  Cheeseburger on the curb.
[59:04.470 --> 59:09.150]  Yeah, that's that's like a corndog and fries, maybe.
[59:09.150 --> 59:12.230]  OK, yeah, and we should be filming you at that point.
[59:12.750 --> 59:18.230]  Yeah, I ever made a twin bicycle that could break off into two unicycles if needed.
[59:18.870 --> 59:20.350]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[59:20.430 --> 59:24.810]  Like when Batman checks out of the Batmobile and it just becomes the fucking motorcycle.
[59:25.170 --> 59:27.390]  How is that never happened in a Bond movie?
[59:28.030 --> 59:31.410]  I'm just saying if you two are staking out and then it's somebody catches you,
[59:31.450 --> 59:32.450]  it's like, oh, we got to break.
[59:32.710 --> 59:33.770]  We're going to separate.
[59:34.030 --> 59:38.350]  You got to get away, snap off into two unicycles and go different directions.
[59:38.350 --> 59:41.550]  I can't imagine like a good mechanical way of doing that.
[59:41.670 --> 59:44.670]  I assume it have to be like explosive bolts that separate.
[59:47.030 --> 59:53.450]  I started looking up how like a tandem bike could become a unicycle and I found instead I found.
[59:54.370 --> 59:56.110]  That's a tandem unicycle.
[59:56.290 --> 59:58.610]  That's a tandem unicycle.
[59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.950]  Basically one wheel with two seats.
[01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.770]  That is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.550]  We have to learn how to do that.
[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:09.190]  It's got two stands.
[01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:11.410]  What the fuck?
[01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:12.770]  Oh, that looks like a nightmare.
[01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.690]  You're just going to eat shit.
[01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.770]  Wait, how are you facing the same way?
[01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.090]  Are you facing each other on that?
[01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:21.870]  You are facing the same way.
[01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:22.990]  OK.
[01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:24.650]  Wow.
[01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:26.190]  Geoff.
[01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:32.070]  Fat Tire Ale used to do this thing where they would have this bike rally that would go around
[01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:36.390]  the country as like a tour and they would sell beer or give away beer and have bands play.
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:39.930]  And then they would have all these insane bicycles like that.
[01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.130]  And then they would just put them in the middle and you could ride them around and break your arm.
[01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:46.190]  And I used to, I took really like two years in a row.
[01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.850]  It was so much fun.
[01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.350]  And I swear to God, I've seen one of those at that thing.
[01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:51.730]  We've got to buy this, Gavin.
[01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:53.270]  Yeah. How much is that?
[01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:56.310]  This looks like it's welded together.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:00.870]  I don't, I don't know that there's, I don't see a price tag on anything.
[01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:05.290]  Can I use regulation to rent a MIG welder?
[01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:06.730]  Absolutely.
[01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.250]  Would it be MIG or TIG? I never know what they're used for.
[01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:13.070]  Who are you asking? Us?
[01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:23.190]  I just thought maybe, because Eric, you're kind of like an oily mechanical guy to look at.
[01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.930]  Yeah, but I don't, yeah, but I don't weld anything.
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:30.650]  You just look like someone who knows something about welding.
[01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.670]  Like, well, I mean, I know how, like, I like work on like a car,
[01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.390]  like I know how to like fix stuff on a car,
[01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.170]  but I don't know how to like, I'm not welding anything.
[01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:39.010]  Do you know how to weld?
[01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:40.670]  No, I'm asking you.
[01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:43.370]  And I keep saying I don't know how to weld.
[01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:44.570]  Well, I'm not asking you anymore.
[01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.990]  Go back to talking about fucking ribs.
[01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:52.510]  I think I might get some ribs for dinner.
[01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.410]  Who's the weldiest guy of the group? It's gotta be you.
[01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:56.350]  That's Eric.
[01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:57.370]  It's definitely Eric.
[01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:58.930]  I mean, it's probably me. I just don't know how to do it.
[01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:00.030]  Yeah, but you'll learn.
[01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.090]  I'll learn. I don't give a shit. Sure.
[01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.950]  Dude, are we going back to Fort...
[01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.550]  Dude, let's go to Fort St. Collins.
[01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:06.790]  Let's go to Fat Tire.
[01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.570]  It used to come to Austin, but I don't know if it's still on tour.
[01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.010]  But that was what it was, Tour of Fat.
[01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:12.910]  Headliner, Murder by Death, huh?
[01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.490]  That's a great band. Murder by Death is a great band.
[01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.250]  Yeah, no, that's cool.
[01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:19.210]  It's their farewell tour, so it was easy one last time.
[01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:20.350]  They had to fuck on.
[01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:25.070]  Someone's coming to kill me eventually.
[01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:28.230]  Well, we should probably wrap this up.
[01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:30.490]  I don't know.
[01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:31.190]  I'm gonna go get some ribs.
[01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:32.650]  Which animal?
[01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:34.950]  I don't know yet. We'll see.
[01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:36.530]  Not a cat.
[01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:36.930]  Yeah.
[01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:39.550]  I do kind of want ribs now.
[01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:40.730]  Yeah, man.
[01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:41.550]  Cat ribs.
[01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:44.490]  There's no way I'm gonna be able to get ribs tonight.
[01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:45.810]  It's just not...
[01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:48.090]  You live in Texas. What do you mean?
[01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.870]  That's a good point.
[01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:53.990]  So Mario Party March has, I assume, ended by the time this comes out.
[01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:56.290]  It is. Do you guys want to take a guess at who won?
[01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:57.290]  Not me.
[01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.650]  There's been some...
[01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:58.950]  You don't think so, Nick?
[01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:00.950]  There's been some hard fumbles so far.
[01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.510]  I feel like I might have a chance at winning just because of other people fumbling.
[01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.550]  Gavin is positioned right now.
[01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:10.310]  I think it's Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, Nick in that order.
[01:03:11.650 --> 01:03:15.770]  And I think the only two people who haven't screwed each other yet is me and Geoff.
[01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:17.430]  We do that off camera.
[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:18.890]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:20.330]  Gotta film it once, guys.
[01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:21.150]  You do that in the truck that you rent.
[01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.810]  Why does this living room have a bed in it?
[01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:29.850]  If Gavin and I tried to fuck, it would be the most unsensical thing.
[01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.930]  We couldn't talk on the phone yesterday.
[01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:32.970]  What happened?
[01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:33.990]  What happened?
[01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:36.590]  You guys were telling me about this, but didn't explain any of it.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:37.110]  What happened?
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.190]  We tried to on the phone call.
[01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:42.190]  I genuinely don't know why Gavin and I couldn't talk on the phone together.
[01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:48.750]  First, you rang me and it came up as my UK...
[01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:49.830]  So I got two SIMs.
[01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:50.610]  I got two eSIMs.
[01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:51.410]  One's my UK number.
[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:53.230]  And it came up with UK written on it.
[01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:57.950]  So I was like, wait, you don't know my English phone number, but why is it ringing my English
[01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.050]  number?
[01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:01.650]  And I was worried if I answered that it would be an international phone call.
[01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:08.290]  So I hung up and then I FaceTime audio'd you and you said hello, but you were also calling me again.
[01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.090]  So I tried to hang that one up.
[01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:13.510]  It hung up the audio, the FaceTime audio.
[01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:18.170]  Then when you call me again, I answered it and I had an itchy ear.
[01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:22.110]  So I moved my headphones to itch my ear.
[01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:24.250]  And it just like unpaired my headphones.
[01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.950]  So then you were coming out of the phone and I was talking to my headphones.
[01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:31.110]  It was a complete mess for about 45 seconds.
[01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.390]  That was the most uncomfortable thing I've ever done.
[01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:39.310]  And by the time we were actually talking, you were annoyed.
[01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:41.650]  I was pretty fucking annoyed.
[01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:42.670]  I was pretty fucking...
[01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.810]  You told me to call you and then you made it very hard to call you.
[01:04:47.090 --> 01:04:49.550]  But don't call my UK number, even though you don't have it.
[01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:51.790]  Don't have two fucking phone numbers, dude.
[01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:54.010]  I don't know. I picked Gavin in my phone.
[01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:55.750]  It's the same number that we text from.
[01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.690]  I don't know.
[01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.490]  They're stupid. It doesn't work.
[01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:04.910]  Do you ever notice how when you call me, it never rings my UK number?
[01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.190]  Why do you think that is?
[01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.630]  I've still got stuff I need that phone number for.
[01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:12.810]  I can't log into my bank without that phone number.
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.010]  Are you serious?
[01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.810]  I can't log into my bank.
[01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:17.510]  Why? What?
[01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:20.510]  I don't know. I'm just... I want ribs.
[01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:22.510]  Do you log into your Canadian bank?
[01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:25.210]  Not via my phone number, no.
[01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.950]  But you use it, right?
[01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:28.930]  To call me, yeah.
[01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:31.150]  No, but you use your Canadian bank.
[01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:32.570]  Yeah.
[01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:33.910]  Because you grew up there, right?
[01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:35.470]  Yeah.
[01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.910]  Yeah.
[01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:37.210]  Yeah.
[01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:39.170]  Ribs.
[01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:39.990]  Now.
[01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:42.270]  What's everybody going to have for dinner?
[01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.390]  I want to know before we hang out.
[01:05:43.850 --> 01:05:44.230]  Ribs.
[01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:45.790]  Probably...
[01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:47.290]  I think it's going to have to be ribs.
[01:05:47.570 --> 01:05:48.830]  I'm going to have to go to Rudy's or something.
[01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:52.310]  What's the superior rib between Chili's and TGI's?
[01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:53.910]  The one that's in my stomach.
[01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:58.070]  Where do you think a TGI Friday's is in Austin?
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.090]  Oh, right. Is there not one?
[01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:01.730]  Oh, they're gone, baby.
[01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:03.670]  I don't know where you'd find it. Yeah.
[01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:04.490]  Where's the nearest one?
[01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.890]  Round Rock, maybe? Round Rock.
[01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:07.090]  Round Rock.
[01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:08.590]  Yeah.
[01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.430]  You guys see that rock? It ain't that round.
[01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:11.490]  No.
[01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:11.990]  Crazy.
[01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.250]  Not round at all.
[01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.970]  Which is crazy because over time rocks get round.
[01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.910]  Yep.
[01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.290]  So one day it will be.
[01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:20.950]  How old are rocks? Do you ever think about that?
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.010]  Nope. Let's go get ribs.
[01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:24.210]  Four billion years?
[01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:26.890]  Like, are all rocks the same age?
[01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.650]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:28.950]  Are sharks older than rocks?
[01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:30.590]  They're equal.
[01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:34.650]  A shark could theoretically live forever, right? If it didn't get a disease.
[01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.150]  Uh...
[01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.770]  Sounds like me.
[01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:39.550]  Yeah, well, what's stopping a human from living forever?
[01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:41.830]  Uh, probably choices.
[01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:43.550]  These fucking foghorns.
[01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.410]  Keep ruining it.
[01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:47.630]  So is everybody really getting ribs for dinner?
[01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:48.970]  Yes.
[01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:50.030]  I kind of want them.
[01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.810]  Yes.
[01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.770]  I think I'm going to get ribs for dinner.
[01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:54.730]  Is anyone not getting ribs?
[01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:59.050]  And you yourself could get ribs if you stop listening to this podcast.
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.410]  No, it's way too early to get ribs.
[01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:03.630]  It's one o'clock for you. You can't get ribs right now. That's not dinner time.
[01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:05.690]  Absolutely get ribs right now.
[01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:06.950]  Are you a lunch ribs guy?
[01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.890]  I'll eat a rib whenever I feel like.
[01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:10.930]  Not for breakfast.
[01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:12.750]  Have you ever had ribs for breakfast?
[01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:15.830]  If I feel like breakfast ribs trying to stop me, you son of a bitch.
[01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:17.270]  Yeah, but you've never done that, surely?
[01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:19.910]  You've never done that, ain't it?
[01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.150]  If I said be sucking on some ribs.
[01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.730]  Andrew, I feel like you're quite aggressive today.
[01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:27.290]  He wants ribs.
[01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:27.930]  I didn't sleep well.
[01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:31.150]  Yeah, but you have the CPAP now.
[01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:33.310]  Yeah, I didn't. I said the mask.
[01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.290]  It blasted off for the night.
[01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:36.830]  It took off.
[01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:39.410]  Kind of like we're about to do.
[01:07:39.550 --> 01:07:42.290]  Thanks for listening to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:47.390]  This one was definitely one of the episodes we have made and released.
[01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:48.670]  We'll see you next week.
[01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.790]  Delicious.
[01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:53.850]  I had a great time.
[01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.410]  Why would you choose chilies when you can go get like Rudie's?
[01:07:58.570 --> 01:07:59.830]  I mean, you're not going anywhere.
[01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:00.850]  You're just going to get it ordered.
[01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:03.810]  I think ribs are trash and it should be from a trashy place.
[01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:05.010]  Fair enough.
[01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:08.210]  Can you two act like you're on a phone call and just be quiet and mute?
