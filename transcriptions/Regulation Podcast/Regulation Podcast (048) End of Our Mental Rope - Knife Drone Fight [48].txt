[00:00.000 --> 00:05.520]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 48. My name
[00:05.520 --> 00:10.560]  is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew, Gavin, Nick, and Eric. They're just first names.
[00:11.120 --> 00:12.620]  Hello. I have a question.
[00:13.040 --> 00:13.700]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:14.060 --> 00:16.060]  I just have a question for someone who speaks coffee.
[00:16.580 --> 00:16.920]  Okay.
[00:17.140 --> 00:20.260]  So I just had a little quick espresso, right? Put it in a mug.
[00:20.700 --> 00:20.760]  Yeah.
[00:20.760 --> 00:24.980]  I was going to make it an Americano. I was going to put hot water in it. Ran out of water,
[00:25.320 --> 00:29.720]  so I just put a bit of milk on top of the espresso shot and microwaved it. What have I made?
[00:30.520 --> 00:34.280]  Milk and espresso together? Is that like a...
[00:34.280 --> 00:34.820]  Flat white?
[00:35.460 --> 00:36.560]  Cortado or latte?
[00:36.560 --> 00:40.260]  No, no, no. It's like a latte, technically, isn't it? Because you've just used... well,
[00:40.300 --> 00:42.360]  was the milk... I guess you microwaved it. You made the milk hot.
[00:42.360 --> 00:44.040]  The milk was just like a splash of milk, though.
[00:44.260 --> 00:45.300]  And it wasn't foam, right?
[00:46.260 --> 00:51.600]  Yeah, then it would be a latte, because isn't a macchiato like milk foam or something?
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.160]  That's Henry Hill's favorite drink, caramel macchiato. Gavin, did I hear correctly when
[00:58.160 --> 01:00.160]  you said earlier you ran out of water?
[01:00.840 --> 01:01.200]  Yeah.
[01:02.060 --> 01:07.100]  What the fuck? Dude, I didn't even clock that. Geoff, congratulations. That was great. That's
[01:07.100 --> 01:10.060]  a good catch. Now, let's get him.
[01:10.580 --> 01:13.240]  You don't make water? Like filtered water?
[01:13.980 --> 01:16.220]  Oh, you know, I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16.260 --> 01:17.780]  So you didn't have any more filter water.
[01:17.920 --> 01:18.620]  And it was okay.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.200]  Yeah, I've got like a tank on the kitchen counter.
[01:21.200 --> 01:24.760]  Mine is in my fridge. It's like in a... you just get it out of the fridge, so...
[01:25.280 --> 01:26.160]  I understand now.
[01:26.160 --> 01:32.460]  See, I've got a fridge that came with the house. It's one of those like upmarket refrigerators,
[01:32.500 --> 01:38.280]  which means that it doesn't have any features. It's a piece of shit. It barely makes ice. It
[01:38.280 --> 01:43.500]  doesn't dispense any water. Yet somehow, probably twice the price of a nice Samsung that could do
[01:43.500 --> 01:44.520]  that and have a screen on it.
[01:44.900 --> 01:48.700]  Here's what I think we should do. Around about... oh, after you someday decide to sell your house
[01:48.700 --> 01:49.320]  and move on.
[01:49.600 --> 01:49.740]  Yeah.
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.420]  And you're emptying it out. I'm going to go take a look at your fridge and I'm going to
[01:53.420 --> 01:56.300]  show you where all that shit is that you didn't notice for two years.
[01:56.400 --> 01:58.220]  Oh, you think he just doesn't know it's there?
[01:58.580 --> 01:58.920]  He might.
[01:58.920 --> 02:01.020]  Can you do that this week? Because I swear, I've like looked...
[02:01.660 --> 02:02.880]  I've looked in like the hinges...
[02:02.880 --> 02:04.200]  It's a very fair point, panels.
[02:04.520 --> 02:08.820]  It only works if you've already sold the fridge, unfortunately. If I tried to show it to you now,
[02:08.860 --> 02:09.660]  I wouldn't be able to find it.
[02:10.540 --> 02:12.560]  Because I have to put water filters in it.
[02:13.420 --> 02:13.780]  Interesting.
[02:14.400 --> 02:17.740]  But I can't find where the water comes out. Yeah, for the ice.
[02:19.140 --> 02:21.620]  So my ice is supposedly nice and filtered,
[02:21.620 --> 02:23.780]  but why can't it just give me water?
[02:25.340 --> 02:28.120]  It has to give you water if it's doing filtering.
[02:28.120 --> 02:31.100]  You constantly have a glass full of ice just melting on the counter.
[02:31.660 --> 02:33.500]  Six hours? Oh, boy.
[02:33.700 --> 02:37.740]  I'm waiting for... so I could shove it into my espresso machine.
[02:38.380 --> 02:41.280]  What temperature water do you want? Okay, you can have that at 215.
[02:44.920 --> 02:48.980]  I... my brain went to a different place, Geoff, when Gavin said water.
[02:48.980 --> 02:53.060]  I realized that's one of the most British-sounding words he has.
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.920]  So I just wrote down British words, water, and I'm going to be on the lookout for more
[02:57.920 --> 03:01.980]  British-sounding words. See if we can get the most British-sounding sentence from Gavin
[03:01.980 --> 03:03.520]  at some point in the future.
[03:04.140 --> 03:07.340]  Water really is... that's a strong one for you.
[03:08.420 --> 03:11.300]  What is the most American-sounding word, Gavin?
[03:13.200 --> 03:13.740]  Freedom.
[03:14.400 --> 03:14.840]  Like...
[03:20.010 --> 03:24.630]  I was trying to, like, quickly somehow post the eagle sound, but I couldn't...
[03:24.630 --> 03:25.310]  I couldn't get that together.
[03:25.730 --> 03:27.810]  It's not in the Discord save sound effects.
[03:28.370 --> 03:35.970]  I was talking to some family member or someone married to a family member of yours at your
[03:35.970 --> 03:40.170]  wedding. We were talking about football. A British dude who was really excited to talk
[03:40.170 --> 03:43.530]  somebody about American football. And his wife, who may or may not be related to you,
[03:43.530 --> 03:48.230]  I can't remember, came over and listened to us talk for about 45 seconds and then said,
[03:48.370 --> 03:53.490]  I haven't understood a single word either of you have said. It's just the most American-sounding
[03:53.490 --> 03:57.830]  thing to me. But none of it makes sense. And none of its actual words. It's just American
[03:57.830 --> 03:59.790]  sounds, which I thought was weird.
[03:59.990 --> 04:05.330]  As a kid, I used to... I had a friend who... we used to make pretend radio. And one of
[04:05.330 --> 04:09.250]  our features was American Word of the Week. And I don't remember any of them. But one of
[04:09.250 --> 04:11.070]  them was... one of them was kerosene.
[04:12.410 --> 04:12.770]  Kerosene.
[04:12.770 --> 04:14.790]  Yeah, that's an American-sounding word.
[04:14.930 --> 04:16.010]  It sounds well American.
[04:16.330 --> 04:21.190]  Yeah, you sound American saying it. It's definitely not a WADA situation.
[04:21.190 --> 04:21.350]  I don't think you could.
[04:22.190 --> 04:27.650]  Kerosene. So how many episodes did you and your friend...
[04:28.270 --> 04:32.430]  Oh, of Hitshit FM? It was, I think, seven or eight episodes.
[04:33.030 --> 04:35.830]  Oh. You don't have those saved anywhere, do you?
[04:36.390 --> 04:38.850]  Oh, they might be on a tape, like a cassette.
[04:39.130 --> 04:40.270]  Oh, you recorded them?
[04:40.710 --> 04:41.590]  Yeah, it was...
[04:41.590 --> 04:41.970]  Wow.
[04:41.970 --> 04:44.550]  We couldn't actually get on the radio, so we had to record it.
[04:44.790 --> 04:48.690]  Gavin, what do we have to do to get and listen to and play that?
[04:49.050 --> 04:50.310]  An episode of Hitshit FM?
[04:50.870 --> 04:52.370]  Yeah. For regulation.
[04:52.910 --> 04:57.870]  God. Oh, God. I think finding it will be a real... real issue.
[04:58.510 --> 05:02.450]  Is that why you're so obsessed with storing stuff now? Because you lost Hitshit FM?
[05:03.270 --> 05:05.550]  And it's haunted you your whole life?
[05:06.070 --> 05:10.590]  I like you keep bringing up this obsession that I store my files. That's not a weird thing.
[05:11.970 --> 05:17.710]  You have drive after drive after drive of file. You don't need all those files. You don't need all of them.
[05:17.710 --> 05:25.450]  But I... you're asking, like, if I'd saved Hitshit FM, if I digitized it in 1997 or whatever it was.
[05:25.870 --> 05:26.070]  Yeah.
[05:26.970 --> 05:28.270]  We would have it right now, wouldn't we?
[05:29.030 --> 05:33.690]  Exactly. Which is why now you do that. That was my point. Because you didn't then.
[05:34.030 --> 05:37.730]  I'm not going to take file advice from the guy who records something, uploads it, and deletes it.
[05:38.350 --> 05:40.550]  Records something, uploads it, and deletes it?
[05:41.510 --> 05:44.190]  Oh, the company went away. Okay, so where are your copies?
[05:44.490 --> 05:44.650]  Oh.
[05:48.090 --> 05:49.330]  Yeah, but the company went away.
[05:51.350 --> 05:55.310]  The company could have chucked you a couple of, like, eight terabyte drives and all of the stuff
[05:55.310 --> 05:57.350]  you've ever recorded for this podcast, you'd still have.
[05:57.850 --> 06:00.150]  Don't need it, though. I don't think anyone needs that.
[06:00.350 --> 06:03.190]  We... we did need it. We did need it.
[06:03.410 --> 06:05.570]  We did end up needing it. That's true.
[06:05.810 --> 06:07.310]  It would have been... yeah, it would have been easier.
[06:07.610 --> 06:12.410]  But your ratio to what you have to what you've used, I'd argue, is way off.
[06:12.490 --> 06:15.770]  I've not finished living yet. Who knows what I'll do later.
[06:16.570 --> 06:19.830]  That's my point, is I'm telling you, you're going to get to the end.
[06:20.110 --> 06:26.730]  You know what your files are? It's like, uh, it's like a big box of cables.
[06:27.350 --> 06:30.710]  You know, you've boxed cables that you've just, like, accumulated.
[06:31.030 --> 06:33.870]  It's a box of labeled and searchable cables.
[06:34.170 --> 06:35.850]  Oh, you have... your cables are really organized?
[06:38.170 --> 06:40.890]  That does sound like you, actually, if you're saving all your storage.
[06:40.890 --> 06:42.670]  You're asking me if I've named my files?
[06:43.130 --> 06:47.190]  I think he's saying that his files, in the analogy that you're using, are the cables.
[06:47.670 --> 06:50.250]  And he's very organized in the way he names his files.
[06:50.490 --> 06:52.350]  Not actual physical cables, Andrew.
[06:52.830 --> 06:54.230]  I'm talking physical cables.
[06:54.490 --> 06:56.850]  I'm saying that I'm going insane.
[06:57.030 --> 06:59.870]  Physical cables, I've got a drawer, a little set of drawers,
[07:00.150 --> 07:01.370]  and they've got different cables in them.
[07:01.610 --> 07:04.770]  Yeah, but my point is, is that you accumulate all these cables,
[07:04.910 --> 07:06.950]  and then you never use, like, 80%.
[07:06.950 --> 07:10.090]  You are having a laugh. You would not believe the amount of times where I've been like,
[07:10.090 --> 07:12.290]  oh, I wish I had this obscure cable.
[07:13.050 --> 07:15.070]  Oh, hang on, hang on, here's one!
[07:16.330 --> 07:16.510]  Gavin?
[07:17.010 --> 07:17.210]  Yeah?
[07:17.350 --> 07:19.730]  I threw away all my cables a few weeks ago.
[07:20.270 --> 07:21.130]  What do you mean?
[07:21.530 --> 07:22.330]  All of them.
[07:23.070 --> 07:26.210]  You threw them away? That's such a waste. Surely you'll need one.
[07:26.990 --> 07:31.050]  But I don't, because they're in a box, and I've never went into the box for the cable.
[07:31.790 --> 07:32.670]  Oh, I always do.
[07:32.990 --> 07:37.170]  I'm constantly going... my cable box is my most frequented box, probably.
[07:37.430 --> 07:39.050]  I'm constantly plugging stuff in.
[07:39.050 --> 07:43.110]  Since I put cables in the last time I put... I stored cables.
[07:43.610 --> 07:44.690]  Don't use it.
[07:44.770 --> 07:47.310]  Got rid of 90% of my cables.
[07:48.210 --> 07:48.930]  They're gone.
[07:48.950 --> 07:51.070]  Did you, like, sell them or donate them, or did you just chuck them?
[07:51.310 --> 07:52.770]  I donated them. I don't know...
[07:54.010 --> 07:55.510]  I'm someone who buys cables.
[07:55.930 --> 07:59.250]  The needy need all these cables. This is a Dreamcast plug.
[08:01.130 --> 08:04.250]  I donated a bunch of old, like, tech stuff I had.
[08:04.650 --> 08:06.310]  And cables was one of it.
[08:06.310 --> 08:12.290]  And my logic was, I know for a fact that I'm getting rid of cables that are related to
[08:12.290 --> 08:13.690]  things I currently own.
[08:14.110 --> 08:19.470]  But if I need it badly, I'll discover it then, and I'll deal with that then.
[08:19.530 --> 08:21.210]  And so far, I've never had that issue.
[08:21.710 --> 08:22.910]  I haven't encountered it yet.
[08:22.990 --> 08:24.410]  And I don't think I will for a long time.
[08:25.010 --> 08:27.830]  I think I have that issue maybe once a month.
[08:28.390 --> 08:30.850]  I go for a right rummage, and I'm like, oh, here's one.
[08:31.250 --> 08:31.630]  Sweet.
[08:32.230 --> 08:34.550]  I guess maybe our tech... I don't know.
[08:35.430 --> 08:35.970]  It's different.
[08:36.310 --> 08:37.530]  What we're going for.
[08:37.830 --> 08:37.970]  Yeah.
[08:38.210 --> 08:40.830]  I guess with what you do as well for work with the slo-mo stuff,
[08:41.010 --> 08:44.610]  you're probably utilizing a lot more different devices than I am.
[08:44.850 --> 08:45.270]  That's fair.
[08:46.030 --> 08:50.630]  We're so deep in this conversation, and Andrew is just for the first time
[08:50.630 --> 08:54.110]  realizing that their needs are not one-to-one.
[08:54.750 --> 08:58.050]  I'm just articulating why... yeah.
[08:59.310 --> 09:00.450]  I'm not articulating.
[09:00.710 --> 09:05.230]  You don't need any specific line of work to have the company you work for just give you
[09:05.230 --> 09:05.870]  a backup drive.
[09:06.430 --> 09:07.150]  That's fair.
[09:08.210 --> 09:09.830]  I just don't think I'll use...
[09:11.210 --> 09:12.650]  Well, I mean, I do it for you.
[09:13.030 --> 09:13.830]  I do it for you.
[09:15.050 --> 09:18.050]  I'll drag my files every once in a while, throw them in a drive,
[09:18.130 --> 09:19.770]  and then go, we're never going to use this.
[09:20.430 --> 09:21.910]  Every once in a while.
[09:23.170 --> 09:24.370]  I've never understood.
[09:25.070 --> 09:27.850]  That's... it's like buying a fire extinguisher.
[09:27.950 --> 09:29.890]  Being like, nah, I don't see myself using it.
[09:29.890 --> 09:30.630]  I've not used it yet.
[09:30.750 --> 09:31.670]  I'm not going to use this.
[09:32.530 --> 09:35.830]  But the difference between you and I is that you own 17 fire extinguishers.
[09:36.350 --> 09:37.150]  That's my point.
[09:37.370 --> 09:40.370]  Good to have different fire extinguishers for different types of fire, in my opinion.
[09:41.990 --> 09:43.790]  You know, while we're arguing, while we're arguing...
[09:43.790 --> 09:44.230]  Not arguing!
[09:44.370 --> 09:46.630]  I want to steer the argument slightly away from you.
[09:46.750 --> 09:47.130]  We're arguing?
[09:47.410 --> 09:48.290]  I didn't know we were arguing.
[09:48.470 --> 09:49.270]  Definitely arguing.
[09:49.730 --> 09:53.390]  After the last episode that came out, which was the one before this one, right?
[09:53.930 --> 09:54.670]  That's how that works.
[09:55.290 --> 09:56.870]  Well, it was... no, the one before the last one.
[09:56.950 --> 09:58.090]  We're talking about worms and...
[09:58.090 --> 09:58.770]  I heard about worms.
[09:58.890 --> 09:59.270]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:59.310 --> 10:02.890]  A lot of the audience, I was surprised, sided with me.
[10:03.210 --> 10:03.870]  They sure did.
[10:03.910 --> 10:04.710]  Yeah, I saw that.
[10:04.710 --> 10:06.530]  There are some people who didn't.
[10:06.610 --> 10:07.670]  I've got an example right here.
[10:07.730 --> 10:11.070]  We can blur out the name, but I just want to address this comment.
[10:11.270 --> 10:13.410]  It says... this is on YouTube.
[10:13.530 --> 10:14.610]  It says, I'm on Andrew's side.
[10:15.310 --> 10:18.010]  Most games don't have an arbitrary number of players, like six.
[10:18.190 --> 10:20.450]  So it's natural to assume four is the max.
[10:20.810 --> 10:22.830]  I didn't know four wasn't the max either.
[10:23.190 --> 10:26.930]  Having the knowledge, Gavin should have thought to point it out sooner.
[10:27.310 --> 10:29.070]  Like, why aren't we all playing?
[10:29.450 --> 10:30.170]  I did!
[10:30.430 --> 10:31.950]  That's exactly what happened!
[10:32.170 --> 10:33.530]  I was in the first one!
[10:33.530 --> 10:35.450]  We didn't need six people.
[10:35.550 --> 10:36.570]  We just needed four.
[10:36.770 --> 10:38.430]  That wasn't it anymore, Worms!
[10:38.530 --> 10:42.330]  The next one I was in, I said, hey, why aren't we all playing?
[10:42.890 --> 10:43.570]  Hey, Gav?
[10:44.610 --> 10:48.310]  Gav, can I just say, before we go any further, can I just say,
[10:48.450 --> 10:50.150]  I really think you got to move on, man.
[10:50.430 --> 10:52.510]  This is so far in the past.
[10:52.790 --> 10:53.450]  That's fair.
[10:53.830 --> 10:55.870]  Before we move on, because you're right.
[10:55.950 --> 10:56.450]  I saw a lot of people...
[10:56.450 --> 10:58.130]  You bring it up every episode.
[10:58.450 --> 10:59.650]  You know, he's right.
[10:59.670 --> 11:02.070]  A lot of people were on his side, and there are a lot of people's...
[11:02.070 --> 11:03.690]  I made...
[11:03.690 --> 11:04.550]  Take your victory lap!
[11:04.890 --> 11:07.570]  Yeah, well, but we're not done with the victory lap yet.
[11:07.750 --> 11:08.710]  We haven't established that.
[11:08.930 --> 11:10.350]  He did, what, you're going to be a sore winner?
[11:10.850 --> 11:11.710]  I don't get it.
[11:11.910 --> 11:14.930]  No, I'm just, I'm saying what I'm trying to get to the point of,
[11:14.970 --> 11:18.570]  there were a lot of people that said that it is my responsibility,
[11:19.130 --> 11:21.750]  even though Gavin brought this up and keeps bringing it up,
[11:21.790 --> 11:24.250]  that it was my responsibility to prove him wrong.
[11:27.490 --> 11:28.550]  So what's the issue?
[11:28.650 --> 11:30.310]  So I just want to, I want to see if I can,
[11:30.670 --> 11:32.550]  is the whole thing that you weren't,
[11:32.650 --> 11:34.810]  there wasn't a Worms experience prior to that,
[11:34.890 --> 11:36.690]  in which we were all there and one of us sat out?
[11:37.150 --> 11:37.810]  Is that what you're saying?
[11:38.770 --> 11:40.150]  Uh, was there? I don't think so.
[11:41.030 --> 11:43.250]  Am I looking for that? Is that the whole point?
[11:43.290 --> 11:44.970]  Is that the conflict that you're yelling about?
[11:45.270 --> 11:45.810]  Okay, I have a clip.
[11:46.370 --> 11:46.730]  I have a clip.
[11:47.710 --> 11:48.350]  Oh, fuck.
[11:49.410 --> 11:49.930]  Okay, go for it.
[11:50.170 --> 11:51.670]  You just shouldn't have brought it up, maybe.
[11:51.770 --> 11:52.730]  Wait, hang on, hang on.
[11:53.390 --> 11:55.030]  I might be, I might be jumping the gun here.
[11:55.090 --> 11:56.810]  I might be on the wrong side of history here.
[11:56.810 --> 12:00.350]  I tried to engineer an out for Gavin three minutes ago.
[12:00.830 --> 12:02.870]  I'm going to put a link to a video in the chat.
[12:04.530 --> 12:06.690]  5950, our first video.
[12:07.210 --> 12:07.690]  Pots Animals.
[12:07.890 --> 12:12.650]  A stream in which the five of us were playing a variety of games.
[12:13.330 --> 12:15.250]  Party Animals was one, because I thought,
[12:15.370 --> 12:17.170]  oh, maybe it was Party Animals I was thinking of,
[12:17.170 --> 12:20.430]  because you were very opposed to AI being involved in Party Animals.
[12:20.530 --> 12:21.570]  So one of us would sit out.
[12:22.030 --> 12:24.530]  I am sharing my screen. Ready?
[12:24.530 --> 12:26.610]  You said, you said 5950?
[12:27.050 --> 12:27.250]  Yep.
[12:27.610 --> 12:29.370]  Okay, here it is from 5945.
[12:29.770 --> 12:29.950]  Here you go.
[12:30.270 --> 12:31.910]  5950, isn't that a psychic level?
[12:31.910 --> 12:32.070]  Shut up.
[12:32.070 --> 12:33.450]  It is unstoppable in this level.
[12:34.290 --> 12:35.450]  I thrive in the cold.
[12:35.450 --> 12:36.130]  Okay, so it ends.
[12:36.610 --> 12:37.630]  We finished Party Animals.
[12:37.750 --> 12:39.250]  We're all here, except someone's sitting out.
[12:40.530 --> 12:41.410]  I'll swap out, I say.
[12:41.450 --> 12:41.930]  I think we should play a different game.
[12:42.570 --> 12:43.810]  Eric thinks we should play a different game.
[12:44.010 --> 12:44.770]  Do you want to play a game of Worms?
[12:45.090 --> 12:45.450]  Yeah.
[12:45.730 --> 12:46.350]  Oh, is it Worms?
[12:46.810 --> 12:49.950]  All of us together, our first big day, we're streaming.
[12:50.730 --> 12:52.210]  So let's go to Worms.
[12:52.250 --> 12:53.010]  All of us.
[12:55.030 --> 12:55.490]  Nope.
[12:55.750 --> 12:57.170]  This is an original Xbox.
[12:57.210 --> 12:58.050]  He's loading it now.
[12:58.470 --> 12:59.150]  Four of us.
[13:01.230 --> 13:02.210]  We're all here.
[13:02.350 --> 13:04.570]  We're still about 498,000.
[13:04.950 --> 13:05.450]  We are.
[13:06.050 --> 13:06.710]  He's got you.
[13:06.830 --> 13:07.690]  All five of us.
[13:07.870 --> 13:11.450]  I'm not in this video, but I'm like, I'm like watching it.
[13:11.710 --> 13:16.230]  He's watching it because we didn't know that we could have more than four.
[13:16.650 --> 13:16.670]  Yep.
[13:16.870 --> 13:17.110]  Yep.
[13:17.550 --> 13:18.430]  You got this, bud.
[13:18.550 --> 13:18.730]  Yep.
[13:18.790 --> 13:19.550]  You're the Worms guy.
[13:19.750 --> 13:21.130]  This is very interesting.
[13:21.510 --> 13:21.730]  Yep.
[13:24.530 --> 13:27.350]  Do you want to wind that back a little bit?
[13:34.490 --> 13:38.410]  I'm real flummoxed about this one.
[13:38.570 --> 13:41.530]  I stand by the fact that we should have known,
[13:41.990 --> 13:46.630]  but there was absolutely opportunity for you to establish this prior to.
[13:46.870 --> 13:49.870]  And it is odd that you didn't in that moment be like, what?
[13:49.890 --> 13:50.950]  What is happening?
[13:51.390 --> 13:52.470]  Why is one of us sitting out?
[13:53.530 --> 13:54.690]  Why aren't we all playing?
[13:55.590 --> 14:00.310]  So if you wrote that comment that I just gave about, you're right.
[14:00.510 --> 14:00.910]  I apologize.
[14:04.390 --> 14:08.710]  Do you think it's because, although you can have five and party animals, can't you?
[14:09.610 --> 14:12.390]  You can have five, but we sat somebody out because you didn't want AI.
[14:12.970 --> 14:14.410]  So then we moved to Worms.
[14:14.570 --> 14:15.670]  But why would I, why would AI?
[14:16.090 --> 14:17.690]  Because it's, I don't think you can have five.
[14:17.750 --> 14:18.470]  I think you can have six.
[14:18.570 --> 14:19.630]  So we'd have to have like one AI.
[14:19.630 --> 14:21.390]  So everyone would have to have AI.
[14:21.390 --> 14:22.510]  Except one team.
[14:22.630 --> 14:24.290]  It would be two human players on a team.
[14:24.390 --> 14:25.730]  And then we've done just five in that.
[14:26.610 --> 14:26.970]  Haven't we?
[14:27.270 --> 14:31.750]  We did much later when we asked Andrew, aren't there other ways to play?
[14:31.930 --> 14:33.210]  And he was like, what do you mean?
[14:33.390 --> 14:37.670]  And then we had to like dig down and figure out the other game modes,
[14:37.770 --> 14:40.950]  much like you had to dig down and find out that Worms was a six player game.
[14:40.950 --> 14:41.310]  Exactly.
[14:42.290 --> 14:45.050]  Look, that was a case of me not knowing.
[14:45.370 --> 14:47.890]  This is a case of you knowing and not vocalizing it for some reason.
[14:53.210 --> 14:58.490]  Every, every year I would say my intelligence gets literally decimated.
[14:58.730 --> 15:00.910]  I don't know what, I don't know what to do about it.
[15:01.710 --> 15:04.410]  Uh, I, I then like realize afterwards,
[15:04.470 --> 15:07.290]  I'm like, oh, what a stupid bastard for sitting through all that for no reason.
[15:07.870 --> 15:08.590]  Happens constantly.
[15:09.130 --> 15:13.730]  Can, can I, since we're talking about depletion of intelligence, I,
[15:13.870 --> 15:14.190]  Of course.
[15:14.350 --> 15:16.330]  I just want to, I want to ask a question.
[15:16.330 --> 15:17.730]  I just kind of want to, I'm just wondering,
[15:18.750 --> 15:21.910]  Geoff, are you okay with names or what's been going on with you, dude?
[15:24.130 --> 15:24.570]  Names?
[15:25.750 --> 15:30.870]  I've been trying to hold it together, but, uh, my entire childhood,
[15:32.270 --> 15:35.130]  my grandmother called everybody by the wrong name.
[15:35.250 --> 15:39.390]  Like anytime my grandmother talked to me, she would go, Jacob, Mike, Adam,
[15:39.990 --> 15:41.330]  Geoffrey, come here.
[15:41.670 --> 15:41.870]  Yeah.
[15:42.070 --> 15:47.350]  And, uh, I think it's just in me.
[15:47.730 --> 15:51.550]  You know, when I, and I hear myself do it, I hear her.
[15:52.030 --> 15:55.770]  And I think that maybe she's moved on now.
[15:56.010 --> 16:00.950]  And I think maybe I've taken the mantle of the porky pig of family name.
[16:01.150 --> 16:03.870]  And so I think it's just who I am, you know?
[16:03.870 --> 16:05.590]  And I think it's still probably only going to get worse.
[16:06.810 --> 16:08.350]  I don't, I haven't noticed it.
[16:08.430 --> 16:10.650]  Is this something happening outside of the podcast?
[16:11.030 --> 16:14.670]  Well, did you listen to it in the, what was it a game we were playing the other day or
[16:14.670 --> 16:18.150]  a podcast where you just, you called every, it was the podcast.
[16:18.150 --> 16:19.990]  We're talking about Mario party and me being late.
[16:20.130 --> 16:22.890]  And then you used everyone's name before you got to yourself.
[16:23.030 --> 16:23.950]  You got to the right one.
[16:24.530 --> 16:27.650]  And then it happened like today when we were playing, uh,
[16:27.650 --> 16:31.150]  Repo where it was like, man, I don't, are you okay?
[16:31.290 --> 16:37.010]  Like it just, it, I, it, it's not a thing that I attribute to you, but in like the last,
[16:37.110 --> 16:40.690]  I would say full week, it's a thing where I'm like, geez, Geoff, what is going on?
[16:40.690 --> 16:45.390]  Well, I will say in the last full week, I've been recording and editing
[16:45.850 --> 16:48.590]  like a demon to get ready for this out of town trip.
[16:48.690 --> 16:52.090]  I think this is like my seventh or eighth recording already.
[16:52.410 --> 16:55.290]  And I was out of town for two days to deal with, you know,
[16:55.410 --> 16:58.210]  uh, dealing with a trip and still didn't miss a Mario recording.
[16:58.350 --> 17:01.650]  So I think I might just be at the end of my mental rope.
[17:03.590 --> 17:05.550]  We should lay out all of our mental ropes.
[17:05.830 --> 17:07.490]  Yeah, I think that totally makes sense.
[17:07.770 --> 17:09.370]  I think that totally makes sense.
[17:09.370 --> 17:13.890]  Plus, plus all the other business shit that's happening behind the scenes that
[17:13.890 --> 17:16.430]  we're not like talking about, you know, that has to get done.
[17:16.470 --> 17:19.870]  It's just been a really insane last two weeks in specific.
[17:20.230 --> 17:27.070]  So I think maybe I'm, it's a, it's a combination of my grandmother's genetics and my, uh,
[17:27.090 --> 17:31.850]  just absolute mental exhaustion and probably a little bit of my advanced age.
[17:32.110 --> 17:35.070]  I think we're all feeling it in different ways. I'm, I'm gonna,
[17:35.070 --> 17:41.130]  I'll expose myself for a real stupid moment that otherwise would have went unnoticed where
[17:41.610 --> 17:46.910]  a few episodes ago you were pitching store names with Nick Geoff.
[17:47.050 --> 17:48.650]  Yeah. What were the store names? You remember them?
[17:49.090 --> 17:52.010]  Uh, yeah, it was the Nick and cranny was the first one.
[17:52.070 --> 17:52.310]  Nick and cranny.
[17:52.670 --> 17:56.750]  And then Nick's snacks was the secondary like cheaper store.
[17:57.330 --> 17:57.510]  Yeah.
[17:57.690 --> 17:59.890]  Uh, yeah, more of like an impulse buy store.
[17:59.970 --> 18:03.430]  And then I had a third one that I didn't pitch to you guys, but, uh,
[18:03.430 --> 18:06.590]  I can't quite remember it, but it was something along the same.
[18:07.070 --> 18:12.850]  If you go back and listen to that conversation, I GTA brained it.
[18:12.930 --> 18:15.950]  I wasn't playing GT. I'm just saying it was the same thing with the hotdog fan.
[18:16.150 --> 18:19.650]  If you listen, there's a moment where I say Nick's knacks,
[18:19.690 --> 18:22.970]  and I think that I just came up with it and I was very proud of it.
[18:23.270 --> 18:27.770]  And then I brought it up after the fact to my partner of like,
[18:27.810 --> 18:30.530]  oh, we're talking Nick's store names. I said Nick's knacks.
[18:30.530 --> 18:33.610]  I think that's a very funny name for a Nick's store.
[18:34.210 --> 18:36.830]  And then I was told a few days later, uh,
[18:36.990 --> 18:43.130]  Geoff said it like 10 seconds before I did, and it just did not register at all.
[18:43.350 --> 18:47.010]  So I had several days of feeling real good about myself
[18:47.010 --> 18:49.430]  for saying a thing that you had already said.
[18:50.130 --> 18:53.570]  It would be so interesting if when you stop recording and say,
[18:53.630 --> 18:54.630]  it's like an hour and 10 minutes,
[18:54.710 --> 18:57.890]  it tells you how many minutes of that recording you were just buffering.
[19:02.370 --> 19:06.250]  Do you want to see some, uh, some of my mental rope falling apart?
[19:06.710 --> 19:07.390]  Yeah, of course.
[19:07.410 --> 19:09.870]  I had to look in my audio recording folder.
[19:10.610 --> 19:11.730]  Oh, oh no.
[19:12.590 --> 19:14.730]  Just to upload today's Mario Party.
[19:15.190 --> 19:18.230]  I realized I called yesterday's part Mario Kart.
[19:20.610 --> 19:22.250]  I just called it Mario Kart.
[19:22.470 --> 19:29.230]  To be honest, yeah, but like the fact that I see your file in there at all,
[19:29.230 --> 19:31.130]  like that's all I'm looking for and I'm happy.
[19:31.870 --> 19:35.030]  I don't really care what you call it as long as that file's in there.
[19:35.210 --> 19:37.450]  Good enough, good enough, good enough. We'll take it.
[19:38.510 --> 19:41.970]  I have a question relating to files because I had,
[19:42.510 --> 19:45.930]  uh, I made a mistake in a recent Mario Party day
[19:45.930 --> 19:51.490]  where I backed out of the game and we had to redo a turn very controversially.
[19:52.650 --> 19:56.890]  And, uh, the recording Gavin's been very opposed.
[19:56.890 --> 20:01.870]  We typically tail sync is very adamant that we don't need to for our average,
[20:01.970 --> 20:03.850]  I'd say like 10 minute videos, which is fine.
[20:05.190 --> 20:08.330]  But that ended up being like 23 minutes because of my mistake.
[20:08.650 --> 20:11.810]  And I requested a tail sync at the end of it,
[20:11.850 --> 20:13.650]  just because it was a technical difficulties thing.
[20:14.450 --> 20:17.330]  I'm curious, at what point are you happy with a tail sync?
[20:17.550 --> 20:20.770]  Just so I know, like, because I didn't know because I brought it up
[20:20.770 --> 20:23.510]  and I didn't want to annoy you by making you do it.
[20:23.530 --> 20:26.090]  But I genuinely don't know where the threshold is of
[20:26.090 --> 20:30.910]  what is the minimum recording time required for you to happily do a tail sync.
[20:31.290 --> 20:33.510]  It's not always for, it's not always for drift.
[20:33.570 --> 20:37.470]  If you miss the, if your recording stopped and you had to start it again,
[20:37.550 --> 20:40.010]  you don't have a first sync. So you need a tail sync.
[20:40.230 --> 20:43.530]  I understand. But the reason you don't want to do it for an eight minute thing
[20:43.530 --> 20:45.350]  is because there's no drift. You've been very adamant.
[20:45.350 --> 20:46.830]  He just wants to know when drift starts.
[20:47.350 --> 20:52.450]  So I'm curious when you are okay with a back tail sync occurring as a group.
[20:53.150 --> 20:54.290]  But what's my threshold?
[20:54.950 --> 20:59.310]  Yeah, because you said bad, eight minutes, 10 minutes, not enough.
[20:59.550 --> 21:02.390]  So I'm curious, where is that line? Just so I know.
[21:03.370 --> 21:05.510]  Because I don't want to inconvenience you.
[21:05.750 --> 21:09.070]  So I have a lot. So it's like, okay, it's less than this.
[21:09.130 --> 21:10.810]  I'm not even going to broach it. It's over this.
[21:11.010 --> 21:12.570]  You don't understand what you're syncing to.
[21:13.210 --> 21:14.890]  Doesn't matter. You're relevant.
[21:15.750 --> 21:17.930]  It's an irrelevant point that you're making.
[21:18.190 --> 21:22.430]  It's not a concept just for us. It's like tail sticks on a film set.
[21:22.430 --> 21:26.630]  The point is, is that there's a safeguard for people that put this together.
[21:27.010 --> 21:28.030]  That's not my job.
[21:28.430 --> 21:30.810]  But my job is to help enforce that safeguard.
[21:30.990 --> 21:32.330]  And you're opposed to it.
[21:32.890 --> 21:34.610]  Understandably so. I'm not saying you're wrong.
[21:34.990 --> 21:38.730]  Like once I want it, I knew that this is going to turn into like a heated thing with you.
[21:38.850 --> 21:39.930]  I'm not attacking you.
[21:40.330 --> 21:41.330]  I want it to be clear.
[21:41.590 --> 21:44.810]  I just don't know where is the line for just so I know.
[21:45.030 --> 21:48.190]  Because when I brought up doing the tail sync at 23 minutes, I was like,
[21:48.230 --> 21:51.050]  I don't want to annoy Gavin, but this is twice as long.
[21:51.050 --> 21:52.990]  Is this acceptable in his eyes?
[21:54.770 --> 21:58.410]  I mean, I've never noticed any perceivable drift like under 40 minutes.
[21:58.910 --> 22:00.530]  Okay, so 40 minutes is the line.
[22:00.870 --> 22:02.470]  But I mean, people don't always drift from each other.
[22:03.370 --> 22:06.950]  They don't, but there's a safeguard in case they do, is the point.
[22:06.990 --> 22:08.790]  Yeah, but here's the thing. Most of the time, you're safe.
[22:08.870 --> 22:10.730]  It'd be like if we were in a haunted house.
[22:10.930 --> 22:12.210]  You've got like a shield.
[22:12.330 --> 22:15.610]  But instead of standing in front of us and protecting us from the dragon,
[22:15.650 --> 22:17.470]  you're standing in front of a bowl of fruit.
[22:17.550 --> 22:18.490]  It doesn't make any sense.
[22:19.110 --> 22:20.330]  You're safeguarding us from...
[22:20.330 --> 22:21.350]  A dragon in a haunted house?
[22:22.830 --> 22:25.690]  Do you think that's what it is in a haunted house?
[22:26.810 --> 22:28.870]  Is this because we played Weepo earlier?
[22:28.950 --> 22:30.210]  Yeah, I've got Weepo on the monitor.
[22:33.530 --> 22:35.250]  There's a dragon in the haunted house?
[22:36.670 --> 22:37.910]  Dragon isn't a ghost.
[22:38.350 --> 22:42.330]  It's like you're standing there with the fire extinguisher, but we're all freezing cold.
[22:45.530 --> 22:46.010]  Okay.
[22:46.650 --> 22:48.970]  I think you're making a point.
[22:49.550 --> 22:52.630]  He's making a point, but it's irrelevant to what I'm saying.
[22:53.130 --> 22:55.090]  You're protecting us from something that hasn't occurred.
[22:55.630 --> 22:58.530]  Yes, but I'm saying the point of my question was,
[22:58.610 --> 23:00.710]  I'm trying to figure out when you think it could.
[23:01.250 --> 23:01.970]  I don't know, 40 minutes?
[23:02.330 --> 23:03.630]  Okay, that's all I wanted.
[23:05.870 --> 23:09.130]  That was a long way around 40 minutes.
[23:10.070 --> 23:11.050]  God damn.
[23:11.050 --> 23:16.270]  Also, I've edited videos for 10 years without tail syncs.
[23:16.390 --> 23:19.630]  If it drifts, you just chop it somewhere in the middle, slide over a bit.
[23:20.250 --> 23:24.250]  Gavin is against tail syncs in general, unless somebody drops a recording.
[23:24.890 --> 23:25.690]  No, I love them.
[23:26.550 --> 23:28.250]  I don't agree with that.
[23:28.710 --> 23:29.990]  It sounds like he's arguing against them.
[23:30.370 --> 23:30.590]  Yeah.
[23:30.970 --> 23:34.470]  We used to not do any kind of sync at all.
[23:34.790 --> 23:35.230]  That's true.
[23:35.710 --> 23:35.870]  Remember that?
[23:35.930 --> 23:38.570]  Early Minecraft, we'd all just start recording and start talking.
[23:39.070 --> 23:41.890]  Well, we were inventing the medium, you know?
[23:43.390 --> 23:46.370]  We hadn't figured out all the rules quite yet.
[23:46.590 --> 23:48.910]  I used to do it in Minecraft, like if someone opened the door,
[23:49.050 --> 23:53.230]  I would find the door sound on everyone's footage and I'd sync it like that.
[23:53.470 --> 23:54.050]  God damn.
[23:55.890 --> 23:59.450]  I'd love to see what the video was that we first sunk, you know?
[23:59.810 --> 24:02.830]  I think it was episode three?
[24:03.790 --> 24:04.910]  Oh, maybe? Achievement City?
[24:05.430 --> 24:05.830]  Okay.
[24:06.310 --> 24:07.150]  All right, there you go.
[24:10.160 --> 24:13.660]  So we've been at this for like a year, just doing this on our own.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.440]  And you have to relearn how to do so much of it and everything.
[24:16.620 --> 24:17.400]  It's really overwhelming.
[24:17.540 --> 24:18.260]  It's really hard to do.
[24:18.340 --> 24:19.960]  You have new tasks every day.
[24:19.960 --> 24:23.220]  But the right tool for the right job is the best way to get things done.
[24:23.280 --> 24:27.840]  And for so many businesses, for millions of businesses, that right tool is Shopify.
[24:28.460 --> 24:33.300]  Shopify is the commerce platform behind millions of businesses around the world.
[24:33.340 --> 24:37.380]  And 10% of all e-commerce in the US, we use it.
[24:38.020 --> 24:41.540]  When you buy stuff from us, we are using Shopify.

[24:42.860 --> 24:43.960]  So is Death Wish Coffee.
[24:44.080 --> 24:45.040]  So is Magic Spoon.
[24:45.380 --> 24:46.480]  And so many other people.
[24:46.880 --> 24:50.500]  Getting started with your own studio is easy.
[24:50.720 --> 24:55.300]  With hundreds of ready-to-use templates, Shopify helps you build a beautiful store online.
[24:55.600 --> 24:57.780]  You can accelerate your own content creation.

[25:09.680 --> 25:13.220]  managing inventory to international shipping to processing returns, blah, blah, blah.
[25:13.600 --> 25:16.880]  All of the boring stuff that when you're running a business, you're like,
[25:16.940 --> 25:17.580]  how do I manage this?
[25:17.620 --> 25:17.980]  What do I do?
[25:18.020 --> 25:18.380]  What do I do?
[25:18.460 --> 25:21.100]  Shopify is there to help you.
[25:21.200 --> 25:22.320]  Again, it's what we use.
[25:22.380 --> 25:23.060]  It's what we lean on.
[25:23.340 --> 25:25.180]  It's what helps us do what we do.
[25:25.260 --> 25:29.700]  So that way, when you go buy stuff from us to support us, we get it to you quickly.
[25:29.700 --> 25:32.600]  It's a whole simpatico system, you know what I mean?
[25:32.760 --> 25:35.700]  And that's what's really good about Shopify and why I love it.

[27:17.900 --> 27:18.460]  Thanks, Factor.
[27:21.080 --> 27:25.520]  So I have three things I want to give you guys the opportunity to pick.
[27:25.960 --> 27:30.060]  I have a game that I've created for you that I think you will absolutely hate.
[27:31.180 --> 27:37.340]  I have a dark mystery that has unfolded in my life and I have a very fun...
[27:37.340 --> 27:39.740]  This is kind of like at the end of Ridiculousness when he gives them the prompt,
[27:39.820 --> 27:42.960]  which you get two prompts and you like pick which one you get and then you watch the clip.
[27:43.140 --> 27:45.440]  Of course, in that case, it's usually the same clip.
[27:45.540 --> 27:47.480]  They just give you two prompts that work for the same clip.
[27:47.480 --> 27:48.520]  It's the illusion of choice.
[27:48.680 --> 27:49.840]  This is actual choice.
[27:49.920 --> 27:55.460]  The third idea is a fun little word game I came up with, movie game I came up with at the airport
[27:55.460 --> 27:59.100]  when I was waiting on American Airlines to get their shit together for four hours the other day.
[27:59.920 --> 28:00.400]  So there you go.
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.200]  Dark mystery, game you'll hate, fun little mall word game.
[28:04.300 --> 28:06.720]  I figure we'll get to the mall eventually, but just fucking...
[28:06.720 --> 28:07.720]  Which one are we going to do today?
[28:07.800 --> 28:09.700]  Should we all post our votes in the chat at the same time?
[28:10.240 --> 28:10.560]  Okay.
[28:10.760 --> 28:10.920]  Okay.
[28:11.100 --> 28:11.420]  Type the number.
[28:12.180 --> 28:12.360]  Okay.
[28:12.540 --> 28:12.820]  All right.
[28:12.860 --> 28:14.400]  So let's go for a point of clarity.
[28:14.560 --> 28:15.480]  The number...
[28:15.480 --> 28:16.540]  Let's order this.
[28:16.780 --> 28:17.040]  All right.
[28:17.040 --> 28:19.240]  So the first will be game you hate.
[28:19.700 --> 28:20.000]  Okay.
[28:20.340 --> 28:21.420]  That's number one.
[28:21.640 --> 28:23.380]  Dark mystery is number two.
[28:23.660 --> 28:23.980]  Okay.
[28:24.800 --> 28:27.540]  Number three is fun movie word game.
[28:27.900 --> 28:28.340]  Okay.
[28:28.860 --> 28:29.820]  Here we go.
[28:29.940 --> 28:30.840]  On three.
[28:31.840 --> 28:33.700]  One, two, three.
[28:34.300 --> 28:36.140]  Ooh, two, two, one, two.
[28:36.440 --> 28:37.200]  Dark mystery.
[28:37.920 --> 28:41.260]  I just want to make sure we get the mystery because we're going to get a game no matter
[28:41.260 --> 28:42.040]  what it sounds like.
[28:42.100 --> 28:43.240]  Sounds like we're going to get at least two of these.
[28:43.280 --> 28:44.720]  Yeah, I'm with Andrew.
[28:44.780 --> 28:46.180]  I really want to know what the dark mystery is.
[28:46.740 --> 28:48.180]  How graphic...
[28:49.280 --> 28:49.960]  Oh, God.
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.620]  ...visually can I be if I sent you guys a photo?
[28:54.720 --> 28:56.500]  This photo probably will not make it on air.
[28:56.880 --> 28:57.560]  Oh, Jesus.
[28:58.040 --> 28:58.480]  Oh, God.
[28:58.520 --> 28:59.220]  I'm nervous now.
[28:59.580 --> 29:00.240]  What the...
[29:00.240 --> 29:01.880]  How dark is this mystery, dude?
[29:02.300 --> 29:03.960]  It's pretty gross.
[29:04.240 --> 29:05.080]  Did you find a dead body?
[29:05.500 --> 29:05.860]  Yes.
[29:05.980 --> 29:07.000]  As a matter of fact, I did.
[29:07.100 --> 29:14.880]  I have stumbled upon a serial killer that lives in my yard sometime last fall next to
[29:14.880 --> 29:15.800]  my trash can.
[29:16.100 --> 29:17.740]  I want to say like maybe October, November.
[29:18.040 --> 29:24.840]  There was a bird, a big bird that had been just ripped to shreds, right?
[29:25.080 --> 29:26.680]  And I thought like, oh, that's hideous.
[29:26.740 --> 29:27.680]  What could have got it?
[29:27.720 --> 29:28.380]  It's so gross.
[29:28.440 --> 29:30.540]  And I had to like grab it before Albert could get to it.
[29:30.820 --> 29:31.840]  And I didn't think anything of it.
[29:31.900 --> 29:36.580]  I, you know, disposed of it and went about my life.
[29:36.800 --> 29:37.800]  Completely forgot about the incident.
[29:37.920 --> 29:43.280]  And then about two months ago, I found a bird in the same spot beheaded.
[29:44.880 --> 29:45.700]  And there was no head.
[29:45.900 --> 29:47.820]  It was just the bird's body and no head.
[29:49.160 --> 29:55.020]  Then one month ago, in the exact same spot, I found just a dead little bird.
[29:55.480 --> 29:57.740]  It didn't have any signs of mauling or anything.
[29:57.860 --> 29:58.620]  So I thought, oh, OK.
[29:59.120 --> 30:02.800]  So I got yesterday, I left to go to the post office for a bit.
[30:03.580 --> 30:07.880]  And you know, like when you walk outside, sometimes you're hit with the stench of death.
[30:08.180 --> 30:08.580]  Yeah.
[30:08.720 --> 30:11.440]  And I was like, oh, my God, it was overpowering.
[30:11.440 --> 30:15.160]  And so I thought maybe there's like a rat in a rat trap or something.
[30:15.160 --> 30:15.500]  I don't know.
[30:15.600 --> 30:16.620]  So I thought I should investigate.
[30:16.980 --> 30:20.860]  And on the other side of my house, in the exact same spot, but on the other side of my house,
[30:20.920 --> 30:23.540]  like my house has two, like, runways that run along the side.
[30:23.620 --> 30:24.600]  It's like a thin yard, you know?
[30:25.260 --> 30:27.580]  On the other side, I found a photo.
[30:28.340 --> 30:29.040]  Well, I didn't find the photo.
[30:29.120 --> 30:31.260]  I took a photo and I'll send it to you.
[30:33.320 --> 30:35.540]  This is... things have accelerated.
[30:36.740 --> 30:37.540]  Oh, my God.
[30:37.540 --> 30:41.120]  Something took a squirrel and ripped it in half.
[30:41.120 --> 30:42.340]  This is crazy.
[30:42.900 --> 30:44.680]  Oh, you should delete that photo now.
[30:44.940 --> 30:45.480]  Oh, my God.
[30:46.200 --> 30:49.920]  There is a serial killer that lives in my tiny little yard.
[30:50.240 --> 30:52.620]  And I think now it knows that I know.
[30:52.920 --> 30:54.380]  That's two squirrels.
[30:54.620 --> 30:55.380]  That's two, yeah.
[30:55.980 --> 30:59.780]  No, it's actually the squirrel ripped in half, I think.
[30:59.780 --> 31:00.940]  But it has two back legs.
[31:01.440 --> 31:02.660]  And a back leg on the other one.
[31:03.120 --> 31:03.340]  Yeah.
[31:04.320 --> 31:05.360]  It's two squirrels.
[31:05.460 --> 31:06.940]  That's a squirrel and a half then.
[31:07.060 --> 31:08.140]  Yeah, it is a squirrel and a half.
[31:08.200 --> 31:08.760]  That is a squirrel and a half.
[31:08.780 --> 31:09.640]  That's a squirrel and a half.
[31:09.640 --> 31:15.360]  Can you do me a favor and delete the photo of the one and a half squirrels, please?
[31:15.500 --> 31:15.860]  Thank you.
[31:16.000 --> 31:16.680]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:16.680 --> 31:17.060]  No problem.
[31:18.340 --> 31:21.180]  It's a hideous photo for sure.
[31:21.920 --> 31:26.440]  That's my dark mystery is that I am now aware that there is something that is hunting animals
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.780]  and not just killing them for nourishment, I assume,
[31:30.240 --> 31:34.600]  but as some sort of an expression of anger and mental illness.
[31:34.960 --> 31:36.720]  Do you need to borrow a security camera?
[31:37.560 --> 31:38.460]  You know what?
[31:38.940 --> 31:39.920]  That's the next step.
[31:40.020 --> 31:42.220]  I need to set up security cameras in those two spots.
[31:42.520 --> 31:43.720]  We gotta see what's going on.
[31:44.000 --> 31:44.760]  Yeah, we should do that.
[31:44.820 --> 31:46.340]  Do you need to borrow a pellet gun?
[31:46.780 --> 31:48.240]  Like, what the fuck, dude?
[31:48.280 --> 31:49.300]  This is crazy.
[31:49.660 --> 31:50.520]  I don't know.
[31:50.700 --> 31:54.540]  And so another thing is I thought like Emily and I were talking about it and I thought,
[31:54.640 --> 31:57.320]  well, maybe it's a raccoon or something.
[31:57.560 --> 32:00.820]  But I don't know that a raccoon could rip something up like that.
[32:00.860 --> 32:02.540]  And I don't know that it would leave that much behind.
[32:02.740 --> 32:05.580]  So it's probably a bird, like an owl or some kind of bird of prey.
[32:05.580 --> 32:09.640]  But we have one of those haiku boxes that records every bird that comes within,
[32:09.960 --> 32:11.660]  you know, 10 feet of our yard or whatever.
[32:11.860 --> 32:13.920]  And there's been nothing on the recording.
[32:14.040 --> 32:17.560]  So there have been no birds that could do this kind of damage.
[32:17.620 --> 32:18.740]  So I really don't know.
[32:19.100 --> 32:20.400]  And there's no cats, by the way.
[32:20.700 --> 32:22.280]  There's no like yard cats around us.
[32:22.380 --> 32:25.460]  I was, we were talking about that and I realized I don't think I've seen a cat in my neighborhood yet.
[32:25.800 --> 32:28.200]  So I really don't know what it is.
[32:28.440 --> 32:28.940]  How did it get?
[32:29.040 --> 32:31.660]  Firstly, it got two squirrels and put them in the same place.
[32:32.100 --> 32:33.900]  Yeah, that's real weird.
[32:34.520 --> 32:35.460]  It is weird, right?
[32:35.460 --> 32:38.480]  Pack a squirrel, maybe the squirrels going packs.
[32:38.660 --> 32:40.800]  I don't know if you can tell, but next to one of those squirrels.
[32:40.860 --> 32:42.940]  Well, it's gone now, but there was a bunch of dryer lint.
[32:43.080 --> 32:48.320]  So I think they must have found the squirrel in its nest and like ripped or them out of
[32:49.220 --> 32:53.640]  like including the fabric of its nest, wherever that was.
[32:54.180 --> 32:59.880]  I think we as a show should send Geoff a child detective set and then get an update
[32:59.880 --> 33:03.000]  once he receives it and he can do a thorough investigation.
[33:04.020 --> 33:05.580]  Figure out everything he needs.
[33:05.840 --> 33:07.780]  Geoff, Geoff, you can be Encyclopedia Brown.
[33:08.220 --> 33:09.560]  I can be Encyclopedia Brown.
[33:09.580 --> 33:13.140]  Well, I would like to solve this outside of the the the library, but
[33:14.540 --> 33:18.220]  I think that the cameras and maybe some sort of junior detective kit,
[33:18.280 --> 33:19.360]  we could get to the bottom of this.
[33:19.420 --> 33:22.380]  But I'm I'm real disturbed now because things seem to be accelerating.
[33:22.980 --> 33:25.340]  Did I ever show you where my bin filled up with water?
[33:26.040 --> 33:28.500]  Yes, it suffocated something, right?
[33:29.020 --> 33:30.780]  Yeah, something drowned in it.
[33:30.780 --> 33:34.060]  Yeah, there's a raccoon or something or a possum.
[33:34.500 --> 33:38.280]  Yeah, I don't think you showed it, but I remember hearing about this.
[33:38.800 --> 33:41.540]  Oh, God, I see the preview image.
[33:41.620 --> 33:42.020]  I'm good.
[33:42.220 --> 33:42.720]  I'm good.
[33:42.760 --> 33:43.700]  What is that?
[33:44.160 --> 33:44.840]  I don't know.
[33:45.720 --> 33:49.660]  I just I just walked out and I smelt I smelt death.
[33:50.140 --> 33:51.840]  Oh, my God, Gavin.
[33:52.240 --> 33:53.580]  You might want to call APD.
[33:56.080 --> 33:57.800]  That that looks like a crud.
[33:57.920 --> 33:59.920]  I thought that's way worse than what I showed you.
[33:59.920 --> 34:00.640]  Oh, my God.
[34:01.320 --> 34:02.200]  Check your water filter.
[34:02.480 --> 34:03.040]  Delete that.
[34:04.220 --> 34:11.100]  Yeah, at some point that bin became because I lost the lid at some point
[34:11.600 --> 34:14.660]  and it became so filled with water that I couldn't move it anymore.
[34:14.740 --> 34:18.240]  And I thought I should really kick that over at some point because the water's in it.
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.520]  Next time I next time I came out, smelt death and there was a rotten animal in it.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.020]  Dude, you know, that's just a mosquito breeding ground.
[34:27.020 --> 34:29.540]  Oh, yeah, no, I don't like that.
[34:29.720 --> 34:30.280]  There were thousands of them.
[34:30.340 --> 34:30.840]  It was rough.
[34:32.080 --> 34:33.780]  There was a dunk in there or something.
[34:34.640 --> 34:37.120]  It's funny you forget your lid and the consequences
[34:37.540 --> 34:40.720]  that animal goes through, whatever that experienced.
[34:41.580 --> 34:43.640]  Yeah, and I can get out because it's just a bin.
[34:43.760 --> 34:45.460]  You think it could just reach up, but I guess not.
[34:46.240 --> 34:46.860]  Yeah, I don't know.
[34:46.920 --> 34:48.700]  And then it looked like something ate it.
[34:48.860 --> 34:51.400]  Well, I think it just got bloated and split open.
[34:52.020 --> 34:54.920]  It makes me wonder if it fell in when it was much more shallow.
[34:54.920 --> 34:57.780]  It died and then the rain lifted it closer to the surface.
[35:00.660 --> 35:01.500]  What a combo.
[35:03.860 --> 35:05.220]  Yeah, careful of your bins.
[35:05.560 --> 35:06.740]  Yeah, I don't know, Geoff.
[35:07.140 --> 35:10.580]  I don't know what I have no answers to your mystery at this current time.
[35:10.960 --> 35:15.960]  Well, we can try the I mean, I'm I'm I'm discovering and putting the pieces together
[35:15.960 --> 35:19.500]  in real time, you know, and so this is all very fresh and new to me, even though this
[35:19.500 --> 35:22.320]  has been something that's going on technically since last October.
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.620]  I didn't realize that there was a pattern until yesterday.
[35:25.520 --> 35:32.200]  And and so so yeah, I'm I'm really interested in the idea of setting up some webcams and
[35:32.200 --> 35:37.100]  seeing if we can figure it out, because while I think it's probably just an owl or some
[35:37.100 --> 35:42.540]  bird that's doing it very quietly and avoiding my haiku box bird detection, like maybe it's
[35:42.540 --> 35:47.320]  like who knows, maybe it's like an owl that was in some sort of an owl gang and suffered
[35:47.320 --> 35:50.300]  like it's maybe it's larynx got cut or something.
[35:50.420 --> 35:52.000]  And so I can't make owl noises anymore.
[35:52.000 --> 35:53.480]  And it's got like a cool owl scar.
[35:53.480 --> 35:55.020]  So it's like a silent killer.
[35:55.680 --> 36:02.520]  But I am a little worried that it might be some sort of a satanic small animal ring that's
[36:02.520 --> 36:04.540]  doing blood sacrifices in my yard.
[36:04.660 --> 36:08.960]  So if it's like maybe like a couple of possums and my neighbor has chickens, like who knows
[36:08.960 --> 36:09.680]  what it could be.
[36:09.880 --> 36:10.440]  Oh, the chickens.
[36:10.880 --> 36:13.180]  It's definitely not the chickens, but they could be a part of.
[36:13.460 --> 36:13.820]  Absolutely.
[36:13.940 --> 36:18.000]  And so, I mean, they could be a part of some sort of a, you know, a dark ritual.
[36:18.360 --> 36:19.220]  For sure, perhaps.
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.840]  I think they're just being left there.
[36:20.920 --> 36:22.500]  I don't think that's where the murders are happening.
[36:22.500 --> 36:26.780]  That's what I was wondering, too, because there's a lack of gore on the crime scene.
[36:27.360 --> 36:28.220]  It has been raining a lot.
[36:28.280 --> 36:29.460]  It could have washed the gore out.
[36:29.640 --> 36:30.560]  That's a good point.
[36:30.980 --> 36:34.880]  That's an excellent point, is that they could be being brought there.
[36:35.480 --> 36:44.180]  And I am missing half a squirrel, about a third of that other squirrel.
[36:44.180 --> 36:46.680]  And then the head for that one bird are just gone.
[36:46.940 --> 36:50.420]  So maybe they're at the site of attack or who knows?
[36:50.500 --> 36:51.060]  God knows.
[36:51.060 --> 36:54.480]  But I'm just hoping that it doesn't escalate any further.
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.040]  And I'm going to keep you guys updated and maybe we'll work out some sort of camera situation.
[36:59.540 --> 37:00.980]  And the junior detective kit.
[37:01.520 --> 37:04.800]  This is a weird thing where I'm processing.
[37:05.340 --> 37:08.520]  I don't actually think I want you to solve this because I don't want that footage.
[37:08.900 --> 37:12.340]  Whatever is occurring, I don't think I need to see that.
[37:12.960 --> 37:15.580]  Yeah, but it's not going to on a night vision camera.
[37:15.640 --> 37:17.080]  It's not going to be as gruesome as the picture.
[37:17.080 --> 37:23.400]  Also, you don't think that if you saw a raccoon and a possum and an owl in a circle in robes
[37:23.400 --> 37:27.440]  performing some dark incantation on a homeless squirrel, you're going to want to see that?
[37:27.540 --> 37:28.420]  No, I'm going to want to see it.
[37:28.760 --> 37:30.480]  They got little robes on. I want to see that.
[37:30.680 --> 37:33.080]  Or what if it's just a guy pulling up in a car?
[37:33.200 --> 37:35.400]  He opens his window and dumps out a bucket of animal bits.
[37:35.660 --> 37:37.700]  Now Gavin's my number one suspect.
[37:38.120 --> 37:39.600]  That was an insane thing to say.
[37:40.480 --> 37:44.980]  What if it happens to be a British individual living in Texas currently
[37:44.980 --> 37:47.720]  that swings on by?
[37:47.980 --> 37:49.420]  This is Gavin's cucumbers.
[37:50.520 --> 37:52.640]  I think he might be leading this investigation.
[37:52.820 --> 37:53.800]  I think he's dropping clues.
[37:54.420 --> 37:56.240]  No, I don't even kill bugs in that.
[37:57.480 --> 38:02.920]  Right. You you just let your buckets do your dirty work and then you deal with the aftermath.
[38:04.120 --> 38:04.960]  That is.
[38:10.220 --> 38:12.200]  You just don't want the bodies on your property.
[38:12.620 --> 38:13.600]  You're not killing them.
[38:13.600 --> 38:16.720]  You're just moving the bodies that have died on your property to Geoff's.
[38:18.060 --> 38:23.920]  I also, you know, we have that serial killer that's killing people around Town Lake.
[38:24.100 --> 38:29.220]  What if they're what if what if the heat is on and they're just they got to aim lower?
[38:29.540 --> 38:30.640]  Oh man, they're on to me.
[38:30.740 --> 38:34.600]  I've been killing too many tech bros and dumping them over the bridge.
[38:34.800 --> 38:37.440]  I better cut a squirrel in half.
[38:37.720 --> 38:42.660]  Keep one half and dump the other full squirrel in this guy's yard.
[38:42.660 --> 38:48.160]  Also, also, what if the other parts to those animals are being dumped in one of my neighbor's
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.960]  yards and they're having a similar discovery right now?
[38:51.260 --> 38:53.460]  You know, I don't I don't want to be overly morbid,
[38:53.540 --> 38:57.260]  but I feel like the transition is similar from going to Coke to Diet Coke.
[38:57.620 --> 39:03.120]  Like maybe they're trying to experience the same thing, but on a lesser level.
[39:03.400 --> 39:04.620]  100% Yeah.
[39:04.760 --> 39:05.680]  Serial killer zero.
[39:06.020 --> 39:06.100]  Yeah.
[39:06.280 --> 39:10.040]  So yeah, like the squirrels are Diet Coke for serial killers.
[39:10.220 --> 39:10.600]  Exactly.
[39:11.040 --> 39:11.240]  Yeah.
[39:11.700 --> 39:12.100]  Wow.
[39:12.400 --> 39:14.720]  Like they've been consuming too much Coke and now.
[39:15.240 --> 39:16.840]  And these are like, I got to be honest.
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.240]  I each one of these ideas is just as plausible as the next to me.
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.500]  And we're just I feel like we're just scratching the surface.
[39:23.540 --> 39:25.740]  That's why I want to get to the bottom of it, because I got to know.
[39:25.820 --> 39:27.680]  Is it the rainy street ripper?
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.080]  Is it an owl?
[39:29.420 --> 39:33.780]  Is it just like a murderous owl that had his throat slit in a gang fight?
[39:33.860 --> 39:39.260]  Or is it is it a dark, satanic, small animal cult?
[39:39.260 --> 39:41.420]  Like it could be any of a myriad of things.
[39:41.980 --> 39:48.220]  I you know, if you start getting Zodiac letters, but with creepers in the letters,
[39:48.380 --> 39:50.660]  I Gavin theory once again, one more Gavin.
[39:52.640 --> 39:54.320]  I thought we can't rule Gavin out.
[39:55.320 --> 39:55.760]  Interesting.
[39:56.260 --> 39:56.700]  Interesting.
[39:57.220 --> 39:59.960]  That's exactly what someone who it was would say.
[40:01.260 --> 40:02.720]  Of course, you'd say it wasn't you.
[40:05.060 --> 40:08.200]  Geoff, are you aware that the the audience has a clip?
[40:09.860 --> 40:10.300]  Yeah.
[40:10.480 --> 40:11.540]  What do they have a clip of?
[40:12.100 --> 40:18.160]  Oh, do they have a clip of me saying collab as if that's some sort of a smoking gun?
[40:18.700 --> 40:19.900]  Is that what you're talking about?
[40:20.200 --> 40:20.520]  Yeah.
[40:20.900 --> 40:22.960]  Yeah. Do you know why I hate the word collab?
[40:23.120 --> 40:27.160]  Because I found myself saying it so much and I fucking hearing myself saying it made me hate it.
[40:27.460 --> 40:32.060]  All they're doing is showing me a video of the day I decided never to say the word again.
[40:32.600 --> 40:33.040]  Interesting.
[40:33.800 --> 40:34.240]  Fantastic.
[40:34.400 --> 40:35.680]  Well, that's a good point.
[40:35.740 --> 40:36.780]  I thought that was so strange.
[40:36.780 --> 40:38.980]  They thought that was some sort of a like, we got you.
[40:39.020 --> 40:39.680]  You used to say it.
[40:39.880 --> 40:41.280]  Yeah, I used to drink a lot, too.
[40:41.360 --> 40:41.980]  I don't anymore.
[40:42.100 --> 40:43.440]  People stop doing things.
[40:45.080 --> 40:45.440]  Or.
[40:46.220 --> 40:47.180]  Cold turkey on board.
[40:47.460 --> 40:50.300]  They keep doing it, but instead it squirrels now.
[40:54.240 --> 40:55.700]  Half a squirrel for every collab.
[40:57.360 --> 41:00.700]  Anyway, I thought that I thought that clip was useless because all it did was be like,
[41:00.760 --> 41:03.280]  yeah, I can hear myself being annoyed with myself in the clip.
[41:03.560 --> 41:04.420]  Like, it should be pretty clear.
[41:04.460 --> 41:06.160]  I don't like saying the word while I'm saying it.
[41:06.160 --> 41:08.000]  I do like the idea of the audience bringing clips.
[41:08.140 --> 41:08.540]  That's phenomenal.
[41:08.640 --> 41:08.940]  Yeah, I do.
[41:08.960 --> 41:14.080]  I really like I think it's I think it's great to have serial killers ever collabed.
[41:14.140 --> 41:15.940]  Has there ever been a known serial killing collab?
[41:16.900 --> 41:19.540]  It's not like most of the Silence of the Lambs sequels.
[41:19.920 --> 41:21.140]  Shipman X West.
[41:21.300 --> 41:21.960]  I mean, in real life.
[41:22.560 --> 41:25.620]  Oh, like, I don't know.
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.180]  Name a famous serial killer like Discover.
[41:28.420 --> 41:31.120]  I'm describing what it sounds like a Dexter season, essentially.
[41:31.160 --> 41:32.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:32.860 --> 41:34.200]  It's the Trinity killer all over.
[41:34.200 --> 41:37.920]  If it happened, it was successful and you don't get to know about it.
[41:38.220 --> 41:38.720]  I guess.
[41:38.840 --> 41:39.140]  Yeah.
[41:39.380 --> 41:39.880]  You know?
[41:40.460 --> 41:40.720]  Yeah.
[41:40.760 --> 41:43.840]  Also, I think serial killers have really slowed down because of technology.
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.900]  You know, it was a serial killers were really prominent in the 60s and the 70s and the 80s
[41:47.900 --> 41:48.940]  when it was harder to catch them.
[41:49.360 --> 41:49.820]  Yeah.
[41:50.360 --> 41:51.100]  Fucking cameras.
[41:51.260 --> 41:53.440]  They take they they they ruin everything.
[41:53.620 --> 41:54.180]  They ruin everything.
[41:58.920 --> 42:04.080]  What a I mean, the surveillance state or whatever complaint like
[42:04.780 --> 42:05.760]  that's the positive.
[42:05.900 --> 42:06.780]  We reduce serial killers.
[42:07.500 --> 42:08.660]  I mean, I would think so.
[42:08.780 --> 42:11.500]  I wonder statistically, or is it just more muddled now?
[42:12.020 --> 42:14.560]  I think it's a lot harder to get away with that stuff, especially with DNA,
[42:15.920 --> 42:17.780]  evidence and technology.
[42:18.100 --> 42:22.460]  But also, I think the real thing is that there were probably a lot more serial killers back
[42:22.460 --> 42:26.360]  in the day that people didn't know about because people weren't because information wasn't
[42:26.360 --> 42:27.740]  shared as readily and as easily.
[42:27.900 --> 42:30.140]  It was harder to to connect dots.
[42:30.860 --> 42:30.980]  Yeah.
[42:30.980 --> 42:34.220]  I wonder how many people with no friends or family were just disappeared and no one even
[42:34.820 --> 42:35.180]  noticed.
[42:35.740 --> 42:35.800]  Yeah.
[42:36.460 --> 42:40.580]  I'm surprised that with modern tech, there's not more technology based killings.
[42:40.940 --> 42:44.420]  You just don't hear a lot of you don't hear a lot about like a drone with a knife on it
[42:44.420 --> 42:45.020]  or anything.
[42:48.600 --> 42:49.800]  Ignore whatever I was going to say.
[42:49.860 --> 42:50.640]  Let's go down this road.
[42:50.880 --> 42:52.340]  A drone with a knife on it, huh?
[42:52.940 --> 42:56.380]  It's just really weird that you don't hear more about a drone with a knife that targets
[42:56.380 --> 42:57.660]  trees with squirrels.
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.600]  It would just be so jarring to get stabbed in the back with a drone.
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.440]  Just swoop down out of nowhere.
[43:04.740 --> 43:07.040]  Walking down, walking down the street and you hear
[43:08.140 --> 43:10.140]  then all of a sudden, what the hell?
[43:10.900 --> 43:15.340]  I'm imagining that that clip that Drake posted to promote that gambling thing of the drone,
[43:15.440 --> 43:19.280]  like pretending he's trying to destroy the drone that's filming him in his apartment.
[43:19.280 --> 43:22.080]  But if there's a knife on it, that is such a better clip.
[43:22.200 --> 43:24.180]  It's the knife drone flying by.
[43:24.560 --> 43:26.240]  I mean, we did it with Roombas, Geoff.
[43:26.240 --> 43:29.820]  Do you think we should put balloons and knives on drones and see what we can do?
[43:30.100 --> 43:31.040]  I think it's a great idea.
[43:31.120 --> 43:32.320]  And I think that's a terrible idea.
[43:32.500 --> 43:34.160]  That's our next live action video.
[43:34.260 --> 43:35.000]  We need two drones.
[43:35.460 --> 43:36.080]  Why are there balloons?
[43:36.600 --> 43:37.360]  That's the target.
[43:37.420 --> 43:37.860]  That's the heart.
[43:38.000 --> 43:38.940]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:38.940 --> 43:41.220]  They're trying to pop each other's balloon.
[43:41.680 --> 43:42.620]  We made a video.
[43:43.180 --> 43:44.320]  OK, I understand.
[43:44.580 --> 43:48.580]  A billion years ago with Roombas and balloons and it did very well.
[43:49.260 --> 43:50.560]  Yeah, I think drones are the...
[43:50.560 --> 43:52.760]  Well, I mean, the nice thing about the Roombas was it was random, right?
[43:52.780 --> 43:54.440]  Because the Roombas have a mind of their own.
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.140]  But I would like skill based.
[43:56.280 --> 43:58.680]  I would like a skill based knife fight with you, yes.
[44:01.580 --> 44:02.620]  Yeah, there you go.
[44:03.880 --> 44:05.260]  I guess the area would be too wide.
[44:05.360 --> 44:08.620]  I was going to say, is there not like an AI drone type thing where it's like autopilot?
[44:09.140 --> 44:10.060]  We'll steer for you.
[44:10.080 --> 44:12.140]  But I guess they'd probably actively avoid each other.
[44:12.400 --> 44:12.800]  You'd never get...
[44:12.800 --> 44:14.500]  Yeah, you could have them like follow you and stuff.
[44:14.520 --> 44:16.520]  But I don't think you would want the knife one when it's doing that.
[44:19.620 --> 44:20.300]  That's very fair.
[44:20.300 --> 44:24.400]  Can we put like GoPros on the drones?
[44:24.720 --> 44:25.800]  Yeah, here's what we do, right?
[44:25.900 --> 44:26.500]  So you can get like a real first...
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.220]  Okay, this...
[44:27.220 --> 44:27.860]  Okay, go for it.
[44:27.940 --> 44:30.920]  We'll do it just like Mario Kart 64 battle mode.
[44:31.400 --> 44:36.080]  Three balloons, four players, GoPros on them.
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.040]  I love it.
[44:38.480 --> 44:38.880]  Perfect.
[44:39.480 --> 44:40.180]  Or all indoors.
[44:41.240 --> 44:41.640]  What?
[44:41.820 --> 44:42.580]  Has to be indoors.
[44:43.020 --> 44:43.360]  What?
[44:43.580 --> 44:44.280]  All indoors.
[44:44.660 --> 44:45.420]  You could do it indoors.
[44:45.740 --> 44:47.500]  You could do it in like a kitchen or something.
[44:48.040 --> 44:48.200]  Yeah.
[44:48.360 --> 44:49.040]  A kitchen?
[44:49.360 --> 44:50.160]  Here's what we'll do.
[44:50.160 --> 44:52.800]  We'll get an office and then we'll do it in our new office.
[44:52.880 --> 44:54.120]  No, no, no, no, no.
[44:54.160 --> 44:57.200]  We can't because that's so close to us.
[44:57.800 --> 45:01.140]  Drones with knives feel like something's going to...
[45:01.140 --> 45:02.720]  What if we play...
[45:02.720 --> 45:03.940]  The knife goes in...
[45:03.940 --> 45:05.680]  No, the knife goes in a rotor.
[45:06.440 --> 45:07.000]  I have a solution.
[45:07.300 --> 45:08.280]  I have a solution, Eric.
[45:08.320 --> 45:08.620]  Don't worry.
[45:09.020 --> 45:15.360]  What if we're outside looking through the windows and operating the drones remotely?
[45:15.360 --> 45:20.700]  Can you imagine people walking by wondering why four dudes are crouched looking into a
[45:20.700 --> 45:23.540]  building and be like, there's knives, drones and knives in there.
[45:24.000 --> 45:24.960]  It'd be an absolute racket.
[45:25.080 --> 45:26.120]  I think we have to do this.
[45:26.200 --> 45:26.600]  All right, hold on.
[45:26.620 --> 45:27.420]  I'm going to put this on the...
[45:27.420 --> 45:28.080]  We're going to drop this.
[45:28.160 --> 45:28.820]  I'm going to put it on the sheet.
[45:28.960 --> 45:33.160]  I think you guys could get together when Gavin needs to shave and just stand outside.
[45:33.260 --> 45:33.980]  Oh my god.
[45:34.040 --> 45:36.640]  And look through a window and make some drones.
[45:37.060 --> 45:37.940]  This is going to be expensive.
[45:38.120 --> 45:40.220]  I've never owned a drone, but I think they're pricey.
[45:40.600 --> 45:41.720]  No, you can't be pricey.
[45:41.800 --> 45:42.180]  We have to...
[45:42.180 --> 45:43.180]  They have to be junk drones.
[45:43.820 --> 45:45.580]  But can a junk drone lift a knife?
[45:46.260 --> 45:47.100]  A small one, sure.
[45:47.740 --> 45:49.480]  We don't need a katana on these drones.
[45:49.900 --> 45:50.940]  I think it's got to be scary, though.
[45:50.960 --> 45:52.160]  It's going to be like a big...
[45:52.160 --> 45:52.880]  Kitchen knife.
[45:52.880 --> 45:53.840]  A big honker of a knife.
[45:53.980 --> 45:55.620]  See, I think it could go either way.
[45:55.740 --> 45:58.040]  I think it could either be incredibly small and ridiculous.
[45:58.380 --> 46:01.380]  What if you draw for knives and there's different sizes?
[46:01.660 --> 46:02.500]  Oh, that's interesting.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.380]  I like this.
[46:05.460 --> 46:09.500]  You could potentially pick the biggest knife, but you might have like a front heavy problem.
[46:09.840 --> 46:12.180]  Yeah, I really like the idea of that.
[46:12.180 --> 46:15.520]  It's possible to have a badass knife that the drone just cannot lift.
[46:15.640 --> 46:16.940]  That you get no air off of.
[46:17.120 --> 46:18.320]  Just like a sitting duck.
[46:18.840 --> 46:19.960]  Dragging along the ground.
[46:21.260 --> 46:22.160]  I think this...
[46:22.160 --> 46:22.640]  I'm writing that down, too.
[46:22.680 --> 46:23.300]  We draw for knives.
[46:23.820 --> 46:25.580]  Yeah, I think this is a good idea, right?
[46:25.660 --> 46:26.400]  Yeah, this is a great idea.
[46:26.720 --> 46:28.420]  And we addressed Eric's safety concerns.
[46:28.840 --> 46:29.860]  Yeah, we'll be outside.
[46:30.660 --> 46:31.380]  This is not...
[46:31.380 --> 46:33.100]  This is not addressing my safety concerns whatsoever.
[46:33.680 --> 46:33.960]  Why not?
[46:34.000 --> 46:34.440]  We're set.
[46:34.660 --> 46:36.360]  What can we do to help you out?
[46:36.780 --> 46:37.620]  I don't foresee...
[46:37.620 --> 46:38.420]  We need to be...
[46:39.120 --> 46:41.760]  If we're going to do it indoors, we need a big location.
[46:41.760 --> 46:44.800]  Like a big hanger or like a warehouse or something.
[46:44.960 --> 46:48.040]  So we can be at a distance watching this.
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.420]  A rotor is going to get hit with a knife and this thing's going to spin.
[46:51.580 --> 46:53.620]  And it's going to gore the slow-mo guy.
[46:54.100 --> 46:54.600]  And it's not...
[46:54.600 --> 46:54.900]  Yeah, but we're outside.
[46:55.920 --> 46:57.320]  He's outside looking through a window.
[46:57.640 --> 46:58.060]  I don't trust...
[46:58.880 --> 46:59.840]  I don't trust that at all.
[46:59.840 --> 47:00.180]  How about this?
[47:00.320 --> 47:03.140]  What if we have him wear goggles and a neck gaiter?
[47:04.800 --> 47:05.240]  What?
[47:05.900 --> 47:07.940]  To protect his neck so it can't be gored.
[47:07.960 --> 47:08.140]  Yeah, he's got it.
[47:08.640 --> 47:08.760]  Yeah.
[47:08.960 --> 47:09.380]  Neck nose.
[47:10.060 --> 47:10.240]  Yeah.
[47:11.200 --> 47:11.840]  Neck gaiter.
[47:12.440 --> 47:13.120]  Yeah, you know what a neck gaiter is.
[47:13.120 --> 47:14.240]  Why would that protect his neck?
[47:14.700 --> 47:15.340]  It's fabric.
[47:17.720 --> 47:20.260]  The knife's going to have to puncture that before it gets to him.
[47:20.860 --> 47:23.640]  We can beef it up. We can put stuff in there.
[47:24.360 --> 47:28.420]  Are we going to go FPV or are we just going to be flying based on sight through the window?
[47:29.500 --> 47:31.580]  I don't know. I guess it depends on the drone we have.
[47:31.840 --> 47:32.100]  Yeah.
[47:32.940 --> 47:36.220]  All right, well, we'll have to investigate because we want to make sure Eric is on board
[47:36.220 --> 47:40.200]  by addressing all of his safety concerns to his satisfaction,
[47:40.720 --> 47:44.000]  while also addressing all of our danger and fun concerns,
[47:44.200 --> 47:46.980]  which require us to do it indoors in a small office.
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.880]  Will this be our first regulation risk assessment?
[47:51.020 --> 47:52.520]  Oh, that's interesting.
[47:52.760 --> 47:55.540]  I assess it as very dangerous.
[47:58.160 --> 48:01.680]  I'm imagining all of the drone shot scenes and ambulance
[48:01.680 --> 48:04.460]  and how terrifying it would be if there's a knife on that thing.
[48:04.620 --> 48:05.780]  Like, that's just a horror movie.
[48:05.780 --> 48:09.840]  Imagine just someone putting a knife on all that footage. It'd be so funny.
[48:15.480 --> 48:16.760]  That's a brilliant idea, Gavin.
[48:17.280 --> 48:18.780]  Yeah, I love it. Well done.
[48:18.940 --> 48:19.200]  I'm excited.
[48:19.380 --> 48:20.560]  Made up for your earlier bullshit.
[48:22.460 --> 48:25.820]  No, that's fair.
[48:26.220 --> 48:29.180]  I just, uh, it is completely irrelevant, but I'm watching.
[48:29.460 --> 48:32.180]  I have a prop auction up on the side for movies,
[48:32.220 --> 48:34.000]  and this is currently what's up for bid.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.160]  I just, I just want to, I just want to share really quickly.
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.560]  It is a Demolition Man, Planet Hollywood collection,
[48:40.720 --> 48:44.700]  cryogenically frozen John Spartan, Sylvester Stallone figure.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.360]  How much is that going for?
[48:46.540 --> 48:47.660]  Currently $10,000.
[48:47.800 --> 48:48.520]  What's the last bid?
[48:49.040 --> 48:51.880]  I think it's sold for $10,000.
[48:51.880 --> 48:52.580]  I want that so bad.
[48:52.660 --> 48:53.860]  It looks so bad.
[48:53.960 --> 48:59.460]  It is like a life-sized, uh, Sylvester Stallone in a very unflattering pose.
[48:59.660 --> 49:01.300]  The least flattering pose.
[49:01.300 --> 49:04.120]  A face that looks like an impersonator.
[49:04.260 --> 49:06.620]  I think in the movie it has bollocks, doesn't it?
[49:07.120 --> 49:09.880]  Well, I think that's a, that black thing I think is cover is like Photoshop.
[49:10.340 --> 49:10.760]  I think it's...
[49:10.760 --> 49:11.120]  Oh, yeah.
[49:11.340 --> 49:13.360]  Yeah, I think it's a naked thing because you see it through the tank.
[49:13.980 --> 49:15.120]  Oh, you think it's got a dick?
[49:15.420 --> 49:16.120]  I think it does.
[49:16.740 --> 49:16.980]  Oh, man.
[49:16.980 --> 49:17.780]  I think I've seen that penis.
[49:18.240 --> 49:20.080]  Why else are you buying it if not for...
[49:20.080 --> 49:20.300]  I think I've seen that penis.
[49:23.840 --> 49:25.480]  I just saw Sylvester Stallone yesterday.
[49:29.990 --> 49:30.690]  I would...
[49:30.690 --> 49:31.390]  Oh, man.
[49:31.390 --> 49:35.990]  Imagine being in person at an auction, seeing the guy who's bidding for that.
[49:36.750 --> 49:37.850]  Ten thousand.
[49:38.390 --> 49:39.510]  I want it.
[49:39.610 --> 49:40.910]  You gotta have it.
[49:43.050 --> 49:46.310]  The next item up for sale is a departed sign.
[49:46.450 --> 49:52.130]  Like, it's just so funny to me to go from those Stallone naked dick hanging out frozen thing to...
[49:52.130 --> 49:54.850]  Oh, here's just an autograph of the cast of The Departed.
[49:55.250 --> 49:57.310]  Bunch of photos put together.
[49:58.370 --> 49:59.850]  Just the biggest transition.
[49:59.850 --> 50:02.090]  Are you excited about your item, Leah?
[50:02.630 --> 50:04.190]  I'm very excited for us.
[50:04.590 --> 50:05.030]  Watch me.
[50:05.210 --> 50:07.970]  I made a joke in the chat that it was too much for the podcast.
[50:08.390 --> 50:08.790]  Thank you, Eric.
[50:11.470 --> 50:14.190]  This whole podcast has been too much for the podcast.
[50:14.390 --> 50:17.210]  This has been this has been one that's like way in one direction.
[50:17.350 --> 50:21.350]  Maybe I should do the game you guys are going to hate and just really send it over the edge.
[50:21.470 --> 50:23.850]  Yeah, we should.
[50:23.950 --> 50:28.750]  But I'm just imagining Stallone somehow learning about what you said as a comment, Geoff,
[50:28.750 --> 50:30.910]  and being outraged about it and making a statement.
[50:31.250 --> 50:32.130]  He would be very upset.
[50:32.430 --> 50:33.530]  Oh, he'd be so upset.
[50:34.070 --> 50:35.090]  Oh, yeah, he wouldn't be happy.
[50:35.370 --> 50:36.010]  He would not like it.
[50:36.350 --> 50:40.130]  OK, I wanted to come up with a theme song and stuff, but then I realized I don't know how to do that.
[50:40.670 --> 50:42.590]  But this is a game show I created.
[50:43.510 --> 50:47.530]  This is a game show I created for you guys months ago that I've been holding onto for
[50:47.530 --> 50:50.550]  just the right moment. And since this is an already gross episode,
[50:50.550 --> 50:55.510]  and I know that this is going to go very badly, and I'll be interested to see if we get through
[50:55.510 --> 50:57.990]  the game, I think that that would be a personal win for me.
[50:58.250 --> 51:01.670]  But I suspect that it'll be one of those things where the audience turns on me and
[51:01.670 --> 51:02.910]  everybody's mad at me for a little while.
[51:03.070 --> 51:05.330]  OK, can you attempt a theme song?
[51:05.910 --> 51:08.450]  Yeah, yeah. Let me hold on a second. Here we go.
[51:10.890 --> 51:12.910]  It's a fart. No, it's not.
[51:13.330 --> 51:16.150]  Oh, no, we've talked about this.
[51:16.530 --> 51:17.790]  It's everybody's favorite game.
[51:18.170 --> 51:19.570]  I don't want to do this.
[51:19.690 --> 51:20.510]  It's something else.
[51:21.270 --> 51:21.650]  What's up?
[51:22.130 --> 51:22.650]  That's our song.
[51:22.770 --> 51:23.710]  This has been pitched.
[51:24.310 --> 51:24.810]  Oh, no.
[51:24.810 --> 51:26.750]  This is our favorite game.
[51:27.190 --> 51:28.610]  We haven't played it yet, so it's new.
[51:28.830 --> 51:32.330]  Is it a fart or is it something else?
[51:32.690 --> 51:33.710]  Now, here's how it works.
[51:33.790 --> 51:35.090]  I'm going to play a clip for you guys.
[51:35.130 --> 51:37.110]  And you have the easiest job in the world.
[51:37.230 --> 51:41.150]  All you have to do is listen to the clip and then you just have to make the determination.
[51:41.650 --> 51:43.810]  That's a fart or it's not.
[51:43.930 --> 51:44.910]  It's something else.
[51:44.970 --> 51:46.050]  And something else could be anything.
[51:46.130 --> 51:49.090]  It could be an Oldsmobile backfiring.
[51:49.390 --> 51:53.450]  It could be a squeaky wheel on a laundry hamper.
[51:53.450 --> 51:56.630]  It could be somebody banging a nail with a hammer.
[51:56.890 --> 51:58.830]  It could be your grandmother saying I love you.
[51:59.310 --> 52:02.250]  It could be anything in the world other than a fart.
[52:02.450 --> 52:03.550]  You just have to tell me.
[52:03.930 --> 52:04.810]  You don't have to tell me what it is.
[52:05.410 --> 52:06.210]  You don't have to get that right.
[52:06.730 --> 52:07.430]  You don't have to try.
[52:07.590 --> 52:09.070]  You just have to say, no, that's not a fart.
[52:09.570 --> 52:12.170]  So the answer will be A, a fart, or B, something else.
[52:12.330 --> 52:13.010]  And we can play the rest of it.
[52:13.050 --> 52:14.490]  A, a fart, or B, something else.
[52:14.970 --> 52:16.630]  Okay, you guys want to try?
[52:16.950 --> 52:17.250]  Yeah.
[52:17.870 --> 52:18.150]  All right.
[52:18.150 --> 52:19.590]  So I'll just play it off my phone.
[52:20.090 --> 52:20.250]  All right.
[52:20.250 --> 52:21.190]  This is the first one.
[52:21.310 --> 52:21.570]  All right.
[52:21.630 --> 52:22.470]  You just have to tell me.
[52:22.470 --> 52:23.450]  Is it a fart?
[52:24.130 --> 52:24.910]  Or something else?
[52:27.550 --> 52:29.170]  Oh my god.
[52:29.370 --> 52:30.550]  Now, was that a fart?
[52:30.890 --> 52:32.410]  Or was it something else?
[52:32.870 --> 52:36.090]  You need to like, like, you need like a lifestyle change, I think.
[52:36.190 --> 52:36.650]  Something else.
[52:37.330 --> 52:38.070]  Something, something else.
[52:38.310 --> 52:39.190]  Does everybody want to weigh in?
[52:39.610 --> 52:42.130]  If it's not a fart, it was more...
[52:42.130 --> 52:43.610]  That was full-blown poo.
[52:44.130 --> 52:44.270]  Yes.
[52:44.330 --> 52:44.470]  Okay.
[52:45.090 --> 52:46.610]  Well, we're not saying what it was.
[52:46.670 --> 52:47.490]  We're just determining Gavin.
[52:47.590 --> 52:48.730]  I think you're the only one who hasn't answered.
[52:49.970 --> 52:50.110]  B.
[52:50.270 --> 52:51.070]  Okay, Gavin says B.
[52:51.390 --> 52:52.070]  That is correct.
[52:52.070 --> 52:53.530]  That was not a fart.
[52:53.650 --> 52:54.830]  That was something else.
[52:54.910 --> 52:55.670]  Do you guys want to hear another one?
[52:56.090 --> 52:56.410]  No.
[52:57.190 --> 52:57.790]  Not really.
[52:58.210 --> 52:58.470]  Oh god.
[52:58.930 --> 52:59.770]  Well, we got to do at least one more.
[53:00.690 --> 53:01.810]  You can't just do a game of one.
[53:01.930 --> 53:02.170]  Let's see.
[53:02.250 --> 53:02.330]  All right.
[53:02.350 --> 53:03.210]  If you guys get it, how about this?
[53:03.230 --> 53:05.130]  If you guys nail this one, you win.
[53:05.790 --> 53:06.130]  All right.
[53:06.310 --> 53:06.870]  What do we win?
[53:07.690 --> 53:08.550]  You don't have to play anymore.
[53:08.870 --> 53:09.270]  Oh, great.
[53:09.370 --> 53:09.590]  Okay.
[53:10.210 --> 53:10.730]  Let's try...
[53:10.730 --> 53:11.990]  Oh, some of these are so long.
[53:12.590 --> 53:13.930]  Fingers crossed for the Oldsmobile.
[53:15.590 --> 53:16.670]  Could be an Oldsmobile.
[53:17.090 --> 53:17.730]  That's correct.
[53:17.930 --> 53:18.730]  You don't never know.
[53:18.850 --> 53:19.670]  You never know.
[53:20.930 --> 53:21.570]  Let's try...
[53:21.570 --> 53:22.730]  Let's try this one.
[53:23.230 --> 53:24.610]  La la la la.
[53:26.770 --> 53:28.190]  Oh, for god's sake.
[53:28.370 --> 53:28.850]  This sucks.
[53:28.990 --> 53:30.330]  This is the worst game in the world.
[53:31.350 --> 53:31.490]  B.
[53:32.170 --> 53:33.270]  It's definitely B.
[53:33.730 --> 53:34.350]  Everybody's B.
[53:34.350 --> 53:34.750]  Correct.
[53:35.010 --> 53:35.190]  Correct.
[53:35.330 --> 53:35.490]  Correct.
[53:35.710 --> 53:37.770]  That was something else.
[53:38.210 --> 53:44.730]  If you guys want to keep playing, I've got six or seven more prompts that I've prepared.
[53:45.290 --> 53:45.990]  Nobody wants...
[53:45.990 --> 53:46.090]  No.
[53:46.310 --> 53:48.290]  Why have you done this?
[53:48.550 --> 53:49.190]  For this reason.
[53:49.190 --> 53:51.790]  I could play the game, fart, or something else.
[53:51.970 --> 53:52.830]  Is it a fart?
[53:52.970 --> 53:53.990]  Or is it not?
[53:54.270 --> 53:55.130]  Is it wet?
[53:55.250 --> 53:56.190]  Or is it hot?
[53:56.310 --> 53:57.090]  Is it a fart?
[53:57.210 --> 53:57.910]  There we go.
[53:59.130 --> 54:00.510]  It's always something else.
[54:01.050 --> 54:01.430]  It's always...
[54:01.430 --> 54:02.550]  It's always the same else.
[54:02.910 --> 54:05.530]  Yeah, the problem is that really the game is just called shit.
[54:06.510 --> 54:10.070]  Unfortunately, we didn't get to a fart because you guys maybe cut the game down early.
[54:10.150 --> 54:11.310]  But we might have at some point.
[54:12.170 --> 54:13.650]  We might have at some point.
[54:13.750 --> 54:14.890]  You could have heard something like this.
[54:15.470 --> 54:15.830]  No.
[54:16.490 --> 54:16.690]  No.
[54:16.770 --> 54:17.090]  Okay.
[54:17.270 --> 54:17.490]  All right.
[54:17.570 --> 54:17.730]  What?
[54:18.350 --> 54:18.530]  What?
[54:18.530 --> 54:22.590]  I mean, should we hear a third just to make sure we give it a fair chance?
[54:22.750 --> 54:23.850]  No, I'm fine.
[54:23.950 --> 54:24.190]  Whatever.
[54:25.050 --> 54:25.550]  Do it.
[54:25.930 --> 54:26.390]  You never know.
[54:26.770 --> 54:28.010]  It could be a fart this time.
[54:28.450 --> 54:29.370]  If it is a fart.
[54:30.090 --> 54:30.690]  All right.
[54:30.750 --> 54:32.890]  Let me see if I can find a good clip.
[54:34.250 --> 54:36.090]  Should we release a separate cut of this?
[54:36.270 --> 54:38.930]  Like the palatable edition and then...
[54:40.090 --> 54:40.870]  That was a definite fart.
[54:41.810 --> 54:42.430]  Oh, okay.
[54:44.430 --> 54:45.390]  Gavin missed it.
[54:46.370 --> 54:46.870]  It was A.
[54:47.030 --> 54:47.230]  Yeah.
[54:47.350 --> 54:47.570]  Sorry.
[54:48.030 --> 54:48.450]  That's all right.
[54:48.450 --> 54:49.310]  You guys got it.
[54:49.690 --> 54:51.470]  There are farts in the mix.
[54:51.630 --> 54:53.030]  It wasn't always going to be something else.
[54:53.110 --> 54:54.110]  There are definitely farts.
[54:55.050 --> 54:57.010]  I wasn't going to do that to you guys.
[54:57.930 --> 54:59.890]  What kind of a game show would that be?
[54:59.930 --> 55:00.890]  That would just be trickery.
[55:02.290 --> 55:06.590]  You've gotten in the room at various streaming companies before.
[55:06.950 --> 55:08.630]  Like you've pitched to Netflix and stuff, haven't you?
[55:08.670 --> 55:09.530]  Or like some other company.
[55:09.850 --> 55:14.310]  Every fucking network you know I have pitched to.
[55:14.610 --> 55:16.710]  We could potentially get you back in the room.
[55:16.710 --> 55:19.690]  Like, Ramsey's back. He's got new ideas.
[55:20.130 --> 55:24.290]  I want you to go in there and actually pitch that and see how long you get to stay in the building.
[55:24.410 --> 55:26.190]  Oh, dude. Are you kidding?
[55:26.350 --> 55:28.430]  I fucking killed in my TLC pitch.
[55:28.470 --> 55:29.530]  They would love this.
[55:29.970 --> 55:31.250]  How do we get you back in?
[55:31.570 --> 55:34.530]  Get me back in the room with TLC or Lifetime.
[55:34.690 --> 55:35.490]  They liked me.
[55:36.830 --> 55:37.850]  Netflix is cool.
[55:38.990 --> 55:40.730]  This feels like more of a Netflix idea.
[55:40.890 --> 55:41.790]  I don't know anybody at Hulu.
[55:42.150 --> 55:42.610]  I don't know.
[55:43.210 --> 55:46.050]  Hey, if you're a network executive and you're interested in
[55:46.050 --> 55:50.190]  potentially a radical new game show, Fart or something else, hit us up.
[55:50.610 --> 55:52.810]  Email me at ericatjeffsboss.com.
[55:53.970 --> 55:56.330]  David Zaslav is frantically typing.
[55:56.590 --> 55:57.510]  We let him go?
[55:58.090 --> 55:58.350]  Yeah.
[55:58.470 --> 55:59.950]  You hear this, Gold?
[56:00.090 --> 56:01.190]  We release this?
[56:01.710 --> 56:01.970]  All right.
[56:01.990 --> 56:06.070]  Well, thank you guys for playing America's favorite new game.
[56:06.670 --> 56:08.670]  Is it a fart or something else?
[56:09.290 --> 56:11.790]  What a shit way to end the episode.
[56:12.010 --> 56:12.510]  Hey!
[56:12.510 --> 56:12.810]  Wait, literally.
[56:14.250 --> 56:15.950]  Oh, something else.
[56:16.050 --> 56:18.430]  You guys want a palate cleanser?
[56:18.490 --> 56:18.670]  Yeah.
[56:19.090 --> 56:19.910]  I don't.
[56:20.130 --> 56:21.670]  I'm so worried.
[56:21.910 --> 56:25.950]  I was killing time at the airport the other day because my flight got delayed 17 times.
[56:26.210 --> 56:27.550]  And I was bored to death.
[56:27.610 --> 56:33.490]  And what I tend to do, my idle mind, instead of like listening to podcasts or doing work,
[56:33.530 --> 56:36.090]  I always end up just like inventing games to occupy my time.
[56:36.370 --> 56:40.870]  And I played Sloppy Joe's Bingo at the airport for a while with the exact same prompts.
[56:40.990 --> 56:42.650]  And it's surprisingly a lot of it works.
[56:43.350 --> 56:47.130]  But even Bingo gets boring if you're just playing by yourself, right?
[56:47.770 --> 56:55.150]  So I came up with a game that is more of a prompt, like a thought starter kind of game.
[56:55.370 --> 56:56.670]  But I had this idea.
[56:56.850 --> 57:01.730]  Take a movie title and flip it and create another movie out of the title
[57:01.730 --> 57:04.530]  that sounds totally different from the movie.
[57:04.590 --> 57:05.230]  I'll give you an example.
[57:05.790 --> 57:11.110]  Point Break flipped would be Breakpoint, a movie about a guy who's having a terrible day
[57:11.110 --> 57:12.310]  and he's at his breaking point.
[57:12.310 --> 57:14.030]  And things just keep getting worse.
[57:14.110 --> 57:15.330]  And can he hold it together, right?
[57:15.570 --> 57:17.090]  So it doesn't work for every movie, right?
[57:17.170 --> 57:18.630]  Because it doesn't change the meaning.
[57:18.810 --> 57:21.430]  Like Surf Ninjas backwards is just Ninjas Surf.
[57:21.890 --> 57:22.750]  That's not cool.
[57:23.090 --> 57:25.550]  But here are some that I think you'll find that are awesome.
[57:25.750 --> 57:26.650]  White Snow.
[57:27.090 --> 57:31.230]  It's a movie about a woman who's dealing cocaine internationally.
[57:32.010 --> 57:33.610]  White Snow instead of Snow White.
[57:33.790 --> 57:35.230]  Completely flips the game on that.
[57:35.430 --> 57:38.290]  The other ones I came up with, Gump Forest.
[57:38.990 --> 57:40.470]  Don't go into the Gump Forest.
[57:40.850 --> 57:41.810]  You may never come out.
[57:41.810 --> 57:42.650]  It's a horror movie.
[57:43.950 --> 57:45.330]  Wrath of the Grapes.
[57:45.970 --> 57:48.090]  Do not make eye contact with the grapes.
[57:48.450 --> 57:49.410]  They're very angry.
[57:50.550 --> 57:51.590]  Dog Reservoir.
[57:51.990 --> 57:53.850]  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to go down there.
[57:55.010 --> 57:56.410]  Society Poets Dead.
[57:56.630 --> 58:01.930]  It's a movie about a serial killer who's targeting society poets, high society poets.
[58:02.630 --> 58:03.210]  Father God.
[58:03.850 --> 58:04.830]  Father God.
[58:05.110 --> 58:07.910]  Father God is a great one.
[58:08.290 --> 58:09.630]  The story of Jesus and his dad.
[58:10.230 --> 58:15.330]  And then the other one I had was The Giant Iron, which is a story about a community that
[58:15.330 --> 58:19.530]  needed a roadside attraction and they didn't have a claim to fame, so they built the world's
[58:19.530 --> 58:20.010]  largest iron.
[58:20.170 --> 58:21.270]  But then they didn't actually.
[58:21.710 --> 58:25.170]  There was one that they just weren't aware of that was even larger and it all ended up
[58:25.170 --> 58:25.470]  in failure.
[58:25.570 --> 58:26.130]  It was a sad movie.
[58:26.670 --> 58:30.130]  And those are those are the ones that I was able to come up with when Summer, I know what
[58:30.130 --> 58:30.810]  you did last.
[58:31.310 --> 58:32.610]  That's great one, Nick.
[58:33.030 --> 58:33.570]  Thank you.
[58:34.430 --> 58:40.250]  We'll say a film that I personally thought was shit, not great action was Three.
[58:40.710 --> 58:41.910]  Battle was not compelling.
[58:44.730 --> 58:46.210]  Ended very quickly.
[58:46.590 --> 58:47.210]  It's pretty good.
[58:47.290 --> 58:48.930]  I have to see that rated 0.0.3.
[58:50.250 --> 58:54.350]  I saw a really cool science fiction movie about this ship that went out of control.
[58:54.470 --> 58:55.670]  It's called Struck Moon.
[58:59.210 --> 59:00.410]  Our Rush.
[59:03.570 --> 59:05.150]  It's surprisingly hard to come up with them.
[59:05.370 --> 59:06.330]  Bull raging.
[59:06.690 --> 59:09.930]  It's just a pissed off bull and he's got a score to settle.
[59:10.330 --> 59:10.930]  That's a good one.
[59:11.010 --> 59:11.950]  That's a good one.
[59:11.950 --> 59:13.430]  I like the golden man with the gun.
[59:13.570 --> 59:15.390]  You're just reworking titles, though, Nick.
[59:15.490 --> 59:15.850]  That's not.
[59:16.990 --> 59:18.170]  It makes having fun.
[59:18.590 --> 59:20.510]  But he's a gold man and he has a gun.
[59:20.690 --> 59:21.910]  You got it backwards, though.
[59:22.270 --> 59:23.210]  Nick's just having a good time.
[59:23.350 --> 59:24.050]  Oh, it's not backwards.
[59:24.290 --> 59:25.490]  He's shifting it around.
[59:27.210 --> 59:28.130]  Bandetta for V.
[59:31.470 --> 59:33.290]  Uh, Poppins, Mary.
[59:33.410 --> 59:35.410]  It's a breakdancing woman in the 1980s.
[59:37.550 --> 59:38.830]  Oh, air con.
[59:40.030 --> 59:41.350]  About air conditioning.
[59:42.030 --> 59:44.650]  No, you're running an elaborate con on an airplane.
[59:46.250 --> 59:47.290]  Bud Air.
[59:47.730 --> 59:54.010]  It's about this new strain of weed that's released into the into the oxygenation system
[59:54.010 --> 59:55.430]  and everybody gets high.
[59:58.950 --> 01:00:00.130]  Oh, no, it's about it.
[01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.570]  It's about the Bud Air.
[01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:02.470]  It's a document.
[01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:07.390]  It's a docudrama about the nation's first weed based airplane service.
[01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:11.630]  Oh, like a soul plane type thing, maybe.
[01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.850]  Yeah, I'm like soul plane.
[01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:14.770]  But but it's like it's kind of like weed tourism.
[01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.770]  So you get on and you get high while you get high.
[01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:17.530]  It's a whole thing.
[01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.130]  Barrel smoking, too.
[01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.870]  And stock lock.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:31.080]  Anyway, I just thought that out there for you guys, if you ever get bored,
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.460]  it's a good way to entertain yourself for about 12 minutes.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.740]  I mean, trying to come up two word movie titles,
[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:40.360]  just trying to think of a bunch of two word movie titles is like tough.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.020]  It is. It is.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:46.100]  I just read I eventually I gave up and just went down lists of best movies for a while.
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.640]  Ice Snake.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:48.580]  That's a good one.
[01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:49.940]  Hustle American.
[01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:53.320]  Just an American guy who just can't stop.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.120]  He's just going.
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:55.620]  He's running across the country.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:56.800]  I love it.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:59.120]  What's great about so many of these is I read them as Yoda.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:00.560]  No, that's pretty good.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.180]  Ice Snake feels like a Yoda thing.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.860]  Sea Blue Deep.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.020]  Yeah, that's a shockingly fun game.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.480]  Yeah, I like it.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.460]  Well, thank you.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.000]  Thank you, American Express.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:16.880]  Thank you, American Airlines.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.900]  Thanks, American Express.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:19.900]  Thank you, Airlines America.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.700]  I'll have a little movie thing for the next episode that I'm excited to share.
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.460]  I stumbled onto something.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.780]  Well, let's end this podcast so that we can wait a week and then find out.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.620]  And if you're listening to the clean version, this is probably about 40 minutes long.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.440]  This one got a little out of control.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:42.520]  We'll get it back.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.880]  Yeah, we'll be back.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.720]  We'll bounce back.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:46.400]  I wouldn't count on it.
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:47.960]  We'll bounce back.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.440]  Unlike the small dead animals in my yard.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.820]  We'll see you next week.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.200]  Don't forget to tell somebody, you know, about this podcast.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.320]  Maybe not this episode, but an episode.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.180]  And as always, we love you.
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.020]  Bye bye.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:00.720]  Bye.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:03.580]  Gavin, should we tailsync?
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:05.280]  It's more than 40 minutes.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.400]  I'm just checking.
