[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  This is episode 49. Whenever you are ready, Geoff, take it away.
[00:03.540 --> 00:05.160]  I yelled the same thing. I don't know why.
[00:05.340 --> 00:07.240]  What? Wait, what did it sound like when you did it?
[00:07.380 --> 00:08.740]  Like, let's hear it.
[00:08.760 --> 00:11.340]  It was like, three, two.
[00:13.700 --> 00:16.600]  Well, in the in the rich tradition of Gavin yelling,
[00:16.900 --> 00:20.200]  hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:20.400 --> 00:22.360]  This is episode 49.
[00:22.640 --> 00:28.080]  My name is Geoff. With me, as always, Andrew, Eric, Gavin, Nick.
[00:29.060 --> 00:30.980]  And this one's not going to be gross.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.220]  Although I will say we're recording these back to back.
[00:33.340 --> 00:35.480]  We just did 48 a couple of seconds ago, so we haven't seen it.
[00:35.500 --> 00:39.140]  But I'm going to guess that the audience response to 48 was glowing
[00:39.140 --> 00:43.420]  and overwhelmingly positive and they want more, more, more.
[00:43.640 --> 00:44.680]  And I appreciate that.
[00:44.720 --> 00:45.960]  But we don't have it queued up yet.
[00:46.220 --> 00:48.560]  We're going to have to go back to the lab for for that.
[00:48.740 --> 00:52.260]  So instead, you're just going to have to get whatever today's about to be.
[00:52.660 --> 00:56.000]  Can I? I don't usually start with stuff.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.780]  I, you know, kind of like leave it to the talent and not me.
[00:59.060 --> 01:02.840]  But can I float something to you guys real quick? Yeah. Talent.
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.300]  Baseball season is back.
[01:07.640 --> 01:13.240]  And I'm a big fan of like double, a triple, a minor league baseball.
[01:13.680 --> 01:17.600]  They do anything they can to get you in the Hartford Yardgoats.
[01:17.660 --> 01:21.760]  The double A affiliate for the Colorado Rockies are showing the float
[01:21.760 --> 01:26.440]  your goat, a quarter pound all beef hot dog with chopped peppers, onions,
[01:26.640 --> 01:31.220]  bacon, a brown mustard submerged in a glass of 100 percent whole goat milk.
[01:32.440 --> 01:34.880]  I'd try it. I didn't realize it was milk.
[01:35.560 --> 01:37.000]  It's milk. Yeah.
[01:37.080 --> 01:39.080]  I thought you just hated water.
[01:41.020 --> 01:45.480]  Oh, God. Get off the screen, float your goat.
[01:45.620 --> 01:48.620]  There's our that's our don't take it off.
[01:48.640 --> 01:50.040]  That's our cover. I need that for the screen.
[01:50.120 --> 01:50.840]  I need that for the thumbnail.
[01:50.840 --> 01:53.100]  So like the squirrels weren't a problem.
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.840]  It's it is. I mean, it's a wet bread thing.
[01:57.440 --> 01:59.220]  Yeah, it just didn't.
[01:59.240 --> 02:01.420]  It didn't strike me as. Oh, that's crazy.
[02:01.740 --> 02:02.580]  You wouldn't eat that.
[02:03.060 --> 02:04.420]  Brutal. I'd try it.
[02:04.620 --> 02:07.000]  You would not. Nick would try it. Nick would absolutely try it.
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.160]  Yeah, Nick would try it. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:08.720 --> 02:11.360]  So do we have to go now to Hartford?
[02:12.220 --> 02:14.240]  I don't. I love Hartford. It's beautiful.
[02:14.560 --> 02:16.100]  I don't know. Let's do it.
[02:16.200 --> 02:18.480]  I feel like there's so many other places we need to go first.
[02:18.480 --> 02:20.620]  I was looking at what
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.740]  the time of this recording is opening day for baseball.
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.340]  Yeah. Baseball started an hour ago.
[02:27.560 --> 02:30.060]  Yeah. The Padres are about to kick off here.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.180]  It's be a tee time here in about six minutes.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.560]  Why don't we just make this for Nick in the.
[02:34.880 --> 02:35.740]  Oh, yeah, we can make it.
[02:35.740 --> 02:38.420]  But like, yeah, whatever. Yeah, whatever floats his goat.
[02:38.440 --> 02:42.440]  I was looking at what the other stadiums were doing
[02:42.440 --> 02:44.200]  because I was looking at like the major league stuff.
[02:44.840 --> 02:48.080]  The blue velvet whoopie pie for the Kansas City Royals,
[02:48.080 --> 02:50.620]  which seems like that seems pretty good.
[02:50.900 --> 02:55.920]  The Phillies are doing a s'mores quesadilla.
[02:56.660 --> 02:58.940]  Oh, I'm in. Yeah, that's that's pretty good.
[02:59.300 --> 03:01.200]  You see the Mariners corn dog?
[03:01.300 --> 03:03.580]  Yeah, that is exactly what I was sending.
[03:03.700 --> 03:06.060]  The Mariners, what up corn dog?
[03:06.160 --> 03:08.140]  Yeah. What the fuck is that?
[03:08.180 --> 03:08.860]  What has happened?
[03:09.320 --> 03:09.620]  What do you mean?
[03:09.680 --> 03:11.080]  Try novelty food.
[03:11.120 --> 03:12.100]  None of this is food.
[03:12.580 --> 03:13.400]  No, it's all food.
[03:13.460 --> 03:16.200]  I just want to understand what I'm looking at with this corn dog.
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.300]  It's it's dyed like taco chips covering the corn dog.
[03:22.600 --> 03:25.900]  That looks like it would be so good at cleaning my tool glasses.
[03:28.900 --> 03:31.720]  You eat that, it's going to clean out your colon is what it's going to do.
[03:32.260 --> 03:37.160]  The St. Paul Saints, who I'm not familiar with at all,
[03:37.400 --> 03:42.360]  are introducing this hot dog with pulled pork and fries covering it
[03:42.360 --> 03:44.420]  that is over 10,000 calories.
[03:44.420 --> 03:47.040]  Oh, it is six feet long.
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.780]  Shit, look at that thing. Let's get it.
[03:50.400 --> 03:52.500]  There's a lot happening in baseball. I'm excited.
[03:52.660 --> 03:54.980]  What's great is that you could use that to measure
[03:54.980 --> 03:58.620]  how far you need to dig for your grave and then you're set once you finish it.
[03:59.140 --> 04:01.820]  You just you take bites leading down to it.
[04:01.860 --> 04:04.300]  When you reach the bottom, you know that you just lay down.
[04:04.440 --> 04:05.700]  It's a perfect measuring stick.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.420]  That would be so funny to make the ground out of shit food
[04:10.420 --> 04:12.320]  and then you eat your grave hole.
[04:13.280 --> 04:15.960]  Eat your grave hole.
[04:16.320 --> 04:22.580]  I want to go back to the Hartford goat thing, the milk dog.
[04:22.920 --> 04:26.420]  Is that going to be an item on their menu for the whole season
[04:26.420 --> 04:28.760]  or is this like a singular game event?
[04:29.060 --> 04:30.240]  I don't know.
[04:30.420 --> 04:35.160]  My understanding is that if they're doing that just for like the one thing
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.980]  for like the Hartford yard goats, I bet that they do it not just for opening day.
[04:39.980 --> 04:42.400]  But I mean, it's a thing to get people in the stadium.
[04:42.680 --> 04:44.660]  Sure. That's the point of that thing.
[04:44.740 --> 04:46.880]  Like we did an episode.
[04:47.040 --> 04:52.380]  There's a thing at the Dell Diamond, the AAA baseball stadium here called Nick.
[04:52.460 --> 04:54.840]  What is it? The Dell Dinger hot dog thing.
[04:54.880 --> 04:55.520]  Is that what it's called?
[04:55.620 --> 04:56.500]  Oh, what was it?
[04:56.600 --> 05:01.680]  And it's it's a hot dog, but on like a grilled cheese.
[05:01.900 --> 05:03.560]  And you go, that's so funny.
[05:03.640 --> 05:04.660]  And then you eat it.
[05:04.700 --> 05:05.880]  You go, that's fucking sucked.
[05:05.960 --> 05:06.740]  But they tricked you.
[05:06.780 --> 05:08.580]  And that's the point of major like minor league baseball.
[05:08.920 --> 05:09.680]  They're just tricking you.
[05:09.680 --> 05:11.740]  I mean, could we just make all these and rank them?
[05:12.220 --> 05:12.640]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:12.660 --> 05:15.040]  Do you want to start with the hot dog in the milk or what?
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.660]  I think Nick was going to take care of that one.
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.960]  And I can do the s'mores crepe or whatever.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.900]  I mean, I think it should be a series that we do.
[05:22.060 --> 05:23.820]  Ballpark, a ballpark bites type series.
[05:25.100 --> 05:28.060]  We'll call it small park bites because we'll be making it in our kitchen.
[05:28.360 --> 05:29.780]  You're so good at that.
[05:29.780 --> 05:30.540]  How did you name it?
[05:30.560 --> 05:31.700]  Great name, Hunter, man.
[05:31.860 --> 05:33.580]  Like that's that was such a good name right there.
[05:34.440 --> 05:35.680]  Dude, I've improved.
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.300]  I put a lot of effort into names since Rooster Teeth and Achievement Hunter.
[05:39.300 --> 05:39.860]  Trust me.
[05:39.860 --> 05:40.560]  And F*** Face.
[05:40.820 --> 05:41.700]  Well, F*** Face is great.
[05:41.800 --> 05:42.580]  I stand by F*** Face.
[05:42.900 --> 05:43.440]  You're right.
[05:44.040 --> 05:44.560]  I don't.
[05:44.560 --> 05:47.400]  I want to propose something to you guys.
[05:47.760 --> 05:48.800]  I'm not done with the hot dog.
[05:49.300 --> 05:50.920]  I mean, if you're moving away from the hot dog.
[05:51.080 --> 05:51.660]  No, no, no.
[05:51.680 --> 05:54.040]  After Andrew's done with the hot dog, I want to propose something to you guys.
[05:54.500 --> 05:55.680]  How long does the season go?
[05:56.020 --> 05:58.760]  When is the last game for the Hartford Yard Goats?
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.520]  Roughly like what month?
[06:00.620 --> 06:02.280]  Probably in August or September.
[06:02.780 --> 06:04.580]  Yeah, it's probably around that.
[06:05.060 --> 06:06.280]  Hartford Yard Goats.
[06:06.740 --> 06:06.940]  Yeah.
[06:07.260 --> 06:09.640]  Gavin hasn't uploaded his files 20 times.
[06:09.840 --> 06:10.520]  Last time I counted.
[06:11.240 --> 06:11.640]  Wow.
[06:11.800 --> 06:12.840]  I've had to ask him about it.
[06:13.240 --> 06:13.640]  20?
[06:14.100 --> 06:15.180]  You're over 20 now.
[06:15.440 --> 06:17.760]  That was prior to a few times I've had to ask him.
[06:17.960 --> 06:19.480]  Are we talking like you?
[06:19.960 --> 06:22.100]  Because a lot of the time with Mario Party, right?
[06:22.160 --> 06:23.600]  You'll be like, upload your file.
[06:23.660 --> 06:26.200]  And it's been 85 seconds since I got off the Discord.
[06:26.380 --> 06:28.020]  It's like, OK, first of all, it's 10 minutes.
[06:28.220 --> 06:32.300]  And that's more than enough time for you to remember to upload an audio file
[06:32.300 --> 06:34.580]  that is so short we don't need a tail sync for.
[06:38.880 --> 06:43.600]  I'm saying any time you forget to upload now and I need to ask you for it.
[06:43.680 --> 06:46.440]  Mario Party is going to be over by the time that this comes out.
[06:46.700 --> 06:50.020]  If I have to, if I get the 50 asks for you,
[06:50.500 --> 06:53.300]  you have to go down and eat this fucking dog at the park.
[06:53.360 --> 06:54.620]  You gotta go to Hartford, Connecticut.
[06:54.920 --> 06:57.960]  By the end of the season, you have 30 strikes.
[06:58.520 --> 06:59.860]  It's way more than they have.
[07:00.040 --> 07:01.260]  30 strikes in your house.
[07:01.780 --> 07:02.500]  So many strikes.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.020]  And until until when?
[07:04.260 --> 07:05.960]  September, September 7th.
[07:05.960 --> 07:06.980]  It would have to be.
[07:07.160 --> 07:09.680]  I would say the last day of August would be the cutoff
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.200]  because we need time to book a flight.
[07:11.480 --> 07:12.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:12.220 --> 07:13.840]  So August 31st.
[07:13.860 --> 07:17.720]  All you have to do is upload your files that you're supposed to upload
[07:17.720 --> 07:21.500]  and not screw that up 30 times between now and August.
[07:21.740 --> 07:24.660]  Well, let me let me do this in classic Andrew fashion, then.
[07:25.460 --> 07:27.420]  Screw your 30, I could do 20.
[07:28.080 --> 07:28.480]  OK.
[07:31.320 --> 07:34.460]  And in classic Andrew fashion, I cannot wait to see this blow up in your face.
[07:35.100 --> 07:36.220]  Yeah, this is.
[07:36.380 --> 07:38.360]  Why would you do anything in Andrew fashion?
[07:38.480 --> 07:39.180]  You're crazy.
[07:39.520 --> 07:40.480]  Boys, get ready.
[07:40.560 --> 07:41.780]  We're going to Hartford.
[07:42.960 --> 07:47.580]  I've got upload confidence now and I upload confidence.
[07:47.800 --> 07:48.620]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:48.700 --> 07:51.340]  Actually, if if I don't upload like.
[07:51.840 --> 07:52.800]  Hold on, Eric.
[07:53.100 --> 07:54.300]  Hold on. Hold your horse.
[07:54.660 --> 07:59.900]  If I don't upload audio and video, does that count as two or one?
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.420]  Yes, that's two. That's two.
[08:01.500 --> 08:02.280]  You forgot two things.
[08:04.900 --> 08:06.000]  That does make sense.
[08:06.040 --> 08:08.720]  That does seem fair, even though it's one ask.
[08:09.060 --> 08:10.500]  It's probably not one ask.
[08:11.040 --> 08:13.120]  I know I'm asking you to do two things.
[08:13.440 --> 08:14.680]  It's two asks.
[08:15.200 --> 08:16.780]  Yeah. Audio and video.
[08:17.100 --> 08:18.340]  Yeah. OK. No, you're right.
[08:18.940 --> 08:20.700]  Yeah. Oh, I like this.
[08:21.060 --> 08:23.640]  I've got until August and I've got 20 strikes.
[08:24.060 --> 08:24.920]  20 strikes. OK.
[08:25.580 --> 08:26.120]  I'm going to win.
[08:26.340 --> 08:27.040]  What do I get if I win?
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.300]  I don't know. Nothing.
[08:29.680 --> 08:30.880]  I'm less annoyed at you.
[08:31.360 --> 08:31.540]  OK.
[08:33.160 --> 08:35.100]  Yeah. What you win, we all win.
[08:35.160 --> 08:35.640]  That's pretty cool.
[08:35.760 --> 08:38.300]  I think they play at Dunkin Donuts Park.
[08:38.640 --> 08:42.600]  If you win, I'll get you a plaque made or a trophy.
[08:43.020 --> 08:44.540]  Look at that. Wow. Pretty cool.
[08:44.840 --> 08:47.420]  And then you can hold on to it until you lose it to somebody else
[08:47.420 --> 08:48.440]  in some kind of a similar bet.
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.340]  It's going to be great when the audience can not only eat the pencil,
[08:53.440 --> 08:55.660]  but also eat the dog milk.
[08:56.120 --> 08:57.040]  It's going to be fantastic.
[08:57.120 --> 08:59.080]  If you refuse to. I would actually do it.
[08:59.080 --> 09:02.580]  I wouldn't just look at the dog milk for four years and not do it.
[09:02.620 --> 09:04.260]  Well, one of them is an edible product.
[09:04.700 --> 09:08.360]  And the other is isn't is not a not a food.
[09:08.620 --> 09:11.000]  Quite a strange thing to to agree to up front.
[09:11.120 --> 09:12.120]  And then when it. Yeah, less.
[09:12.400 --> 09:14.080]  Yeah, that was that was a huge mistake.
[09:16.840 --> 09:18.100]  You're arguing on that point.
[09:18.280 --> 09:21.380]  I just don't think there's comparable a food item to a non food item.
[09:21.700 --> 09:24.880]  I mean, you get a snack and a drink at the same time.
[09:25.220 --> 09:26.000]  Let me be honest with you.
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.360]  I think one of the other of us will eat the pencil before you do.
[09:33.040 --> 09:34.980]  I did see somebody say that
[09:36.200 --> 09:39.220]  Andrew and I should trade and he should do seven day survivor
[09:39.220 --> 09:40.040]  and I should eat the pencil.
[09:40.320 --> 09:42.680]  I got no problem eating the pencil, but it'll be a cold day in hell
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.560]  before that seven day survivor gets done in my name by anybody on this fucking earth.
[09:47.960 --> 09:50.640]  Jesus, I've got to I've got to start delivering
[09:50.640 --> 09:52.540]  because, you know, Andrew's pretty slow on the pencil.
[09:52.680 --> 09:54.100]  Nick's pretty damn slow on these boots.
[09:54.340 --> 09:55.540]  I want to get this limbo going.
[09:55.540 --> 09:56.960]  What? I need you guys.
[09:57.220 --> 09:58.340]  Yeah. All right. Oh, yeah.
[09:58.640 --> 09:59.740]  Do you want to stream it?
[10:00.120 --> 10:01.720]  Like, is it like a streamable thing?
[10:02.040 --> 10:05.260]  I think it's a streamable thing, but it just has to come out.
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.920]  I'll need time to, like, learn it, won't I?
[10:07.200 --> 10:08.900]  I could potentially stream the attempt.
[10:09.300 --> 10:11.240]  But should I do my research beforehand?
[10:11.800 --> 10:13.400]  Oh, I was just thinking we do it on Fridays.
[10:13.480 --> 10:14.500]  I want to watch you do this.
[10:14.580 --> 10:15.540]  But I mean, like.
[10:15.740 --> 10:17.340]  OK, yeah, we can try. Yeah.
[10:17.380 --> 10:19.680]  Yeah. I mean, it's only like a three hour game.
[10:20.100 --> 10:21.940]  It's a three hour game, but we only stream for like an hour.
[10:22.140 --> 10:24.100]  I just we might have to stream until like 8.01.
[10:24.100 --> 10:25.680]  Oh, I don't know how this game works.
[10:25.820 --> 10:27.180]  I don't know anything about this game.
[10:27.680 --> 10:29.180]  I'm just spit. I'm spitballing.
[10:29.340 --> 10:30.220]  Is there saving?
[10:30.420 --> 10:32.900]  The whole point is that Eric is that he beats the game start to finish
[10:32.900 --> 10:34.540]  with less than five deaths, I think.
[10:34.780 --> 10:35.620]  Here's what's going to happen.
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.360]  I'm going to oh, I'm going to die maybe 50 to 100 times
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.920]  just playing the game through that.
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.420]  I'm going to remember all the times I died and start trying to make it further
[10:44.420 --> 10:47.440]  and further without dying until I make it to the end with five deaths or less.
[10:47.740 --> 10:49.360]  I was thinking about this just last night.
[10:49.460 --> 10:51.460]  I've always wanted to get this achievement as well.
[10:51.800 --> 10:53.860]  So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to play
[10:54.100 --> 10:55.360]  just slightly behind you.
[10:55.440 --> 10:57.300]  I'm going to watch you play and then play.
[10:57.480 --> 10:58.680]  Oh, that's so smart.
[10:58.680 --> 10:59.520]  However, you die.
[10:59.700 --> 11:00.140]  You're a genius.
[11:00.380 --> 11:01.220]  OK, I'm not going to do that.
[11:01.380 --> 11:02.520]  That's so good.
[11:02.520 --> 11:04.680]  That is the smartest thing I've ever heard.
[11:04.780 --> 11:05.560]  That's brilliant.
[11:05.860 --> 11:06.980]  I can't even be mad at that.
[11:07.340 --> 11:10.680]  Nick, you should play slightly behind Andrew.
[11:11.020 --> 11:13.840]  OK. Does anyone want to play slightly ahead of me?
[11:17.380 --> 11:18.940]  I've never even played the fucking game.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.260]  It's a good game.
[11:20.600 --> 11:22.740]  If someone knows what's coming up, can they tell me?
[11:22.740 --> 11:24.460]  I think so, but none of us would.
[11:24.820 --> 11:25.100]  Yeah.
[11:27.660 --> 11:29.340]  Yeah, maybe if you had better friends.
[11:29.780 --> 11:31.300]  You said that so matter of fact.
[11:31.700 --> 11:32.960]  No, it's just the truth.
[11:33.080 --> 11:33.740]  Like, yeah, absolutely.
[11:34.060 --> 11:34.900]  Yeah, none of us are going to.
[11:35.280 --> 11:37.860]  None of us know that game well enough to be able to do that.
[11:37.920 --> 11:40.420]  But even if we did, you're not getting any lifelines.
[11:40.880 --> 11:42.340]  I just learned it's three hours long.
[11:42.580 --> 11:44.300]  Imagine if you watched me play all the way through.
[11:44.540 --> 11:47.000]  You would then know and you could remind me.
[11:47.300 --> 11:50.580]  OK, you'd get a lifeline, but it'd be soaked in kerosene,
[11:50.580 --> 11:52.920]  which is a hell of an American sounding word, by the way.
[11:56.120 --> 11:57.640]  We got to do Nick in the Boots.
[11:57.860 --> 12:00.500]  I've been trying to push for it for quite a while.
[12:00.740 --> 12:02.080]  We have so much to do.
[12:02.180 --> 12:04.420]  We also have face off season two.
[12:04.680 --> 12:07.800]  We have Wheel of Decades coming up, which I'm very excited about.
[12:07.900 --> 12:09.520]  I'm really excited about this limbo thing.
[12:09.640 --> 12:10.440]  And of course, our summer.
[12:10.980 --> 12:13.480]  We got a Nick in the Boots thing, which will have to be a summer trip,
[12:13.500 --> 12:15.500]  I think, at this point.
[12:15.920 --> 12:17.000]  OK. To the mall.
[12:17.100 --> 12:18.140]  I mean, a summer trip to the mall.
[12:18.160 --> 12:18.760]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:18.760 --> 12:20.200]  A summer? Wait, summer?
[12:20.900 --> 12:21.800]  Well, when else are we going to do it?
[12:22.160 --> 12:24.180]  Anytime. It's just him wearing boots.
[12:24.460 --> 12:26.040]  Why is that what you're incredulous about?
[12:26.200 --> 12:29.040]  Like what? It just became spring at this point.
[12:29.560 --> 12:31.340]  Yeah, like that feels so long.
[12:31.740 --> 12:34.460]  I just feel like we're I'm about to be out of town forever.
[12:35.040 --> 12:39.600]  And then we have the anniversary to get ready for and all the store stuff
[12:39.600 --> 12:41.540]  and all the stuff, the content that we have to prepare for that.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.360]  And then that whole big thing.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.780]  And then and then you're going to turn around.
[12:43.840 --> 12:44.360]  It's going to be June.
[12:44.480 --> 12:45.780]  And then I figured then we do it.
[12:45.780 --> 12:49.740]  Well, there's a scenario in which Face Off season two is not that far away.
[12:49.800 --> 12:52.860]  And I don't think we can start that until Nick films the boots.
[12:53.140 --> 12:54.540]  I think you're right about that.
[12:54.660 --> 12:57.180]  I don't think it can begin until that comes out.
[12:57.580 --> 12:59.780]  I'll eagerly await that scenario.
[13:00.740 --> 13:05.600]  But I do think that we can start trying to pencil this thing in on the calendar.
[13:05.760 --> 13:07.980]  But I have a feeling what Geoff said is pretty accurate.
[13:08.120 --> 13:10.740]  It's going to be a minute before we can probably get to it.
[13:10.920 --> 13:13.000]  I just know how hard it is for us to schedule stuff in person.
[13:13.000 --> 13:17.000]  And I just am just feeling like we're pretty we're more busy than we think.
[13:17.240 --> 13:19.200]  Hopefully it's much easier soon.
[13:19.460 --> 13:20.520]  God, I hope so.
[13:20.640 --> 13:22.860]  We don't we just want to keep using your kitchen.
[13:23.040 --> 13:24.900]  Well, the boots aren't going to do any good in my kitchen.
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.860]  No, no. I have a clip.
[13:27.200 --> 13:28.680]  Oh, shit. Gavin again.
[13:28.940 --> 13:30.080]  That was fast. Yeah.
[13:30.240 --> 13:32.480]  Gavin's heard this before, but it just it's it's fit.
[13:32.640 --> 13:33.080]  It's fitting.
[13:33.600 --> 13:36.640]  I've been going through a CPAP journey, as you all know,
[13:37.020 --> 13:41.380]  going through different things and the exact same day
[13:41.380 --> 13:45.680]  that we recorded the podcast about the foghorn being a sign of death.
[13:46.100 --> 13:48.500]  I tried a different CPAP mask
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.980]  and I was testing it out and I fell asleep.
[13:52.140 --> 13:55.620]  And then I woke up a little bit later to a large message
[13:55.620 --> 13:59.860]  that my partner wrote saying, I don't know what is happening,
[14:00.120 --> 14:03.160]  but you're making a foghorn like noise through that.
[14:03.280 --> 14:05.660]  Something's not right with how you have this mask on.
[14:06.380 --> 14:08.700]  And they recorded audio of it.
[14:08.880 --> 14:10.580]  I'm dropping it in the thing.
[14:10.580 --> 14:14.040]  And they they had no context of the foghorn conversation.
[14:15.500 --> 14:19.300]  So when I read that you were you were making a foghorn noise
[14:19.300 --> 14:22.760]  after we had spent the entire day talking about that, a foghorn
[14:22.760 --> 14:25.220]  would go off, indicating your imminent death.
[14:25.480 --> 14:26.780]  It was very alarming.
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.480]  Here's the audio clip I'm putting as a video.
[14:29.640 --> 14:31.020]  It's a black video.
[14:31.380 --> 14:32.540]  If you want to listen.
[14:33.080 --> 14:34.940]  Three, two, one.
[14:40.610 --> 14:42.070]  Do you hear anything?
[14:43.090 --> 14:43.770]  It's a slow build.
[14:51.820 --> 14:53.360]  Oh, my God.
[14:59.440 --> 15:01.300]  Sounds like a ship pulling in.
[15:04.520 --> 15:07.620]  My my response was, oh, shit, who just got born?
[15:08.300 --> 15:13.380]  That was the most foghorn sound you've ever heard.
[15:13.840 --> 15:16.220]  It wasn't even just like generic horn sound.
[15:16.280 --> 15:18.480]  It was literally like I would think a ship is there.
[15:18.480 --> 15:21.320]  I was 100% foghorn.
[15:21.620 --> 15:24.160]  I felt like I was wearing a peacoat.
[15:24.220 --> 15:25.280]  Oh, my God.
[15:26.480 --> 15:30.780]  So you you sounded like a horror movie trailer
[15:30.780 --> 15:33.040]  where it goes boom.
[15:34.780 --> 15:36.460]  Like what the fuck?
[15:36.460 --> 15:41.400]  So it was a thing where like the mask seal, because I accidentally recreated it
[15:41.400 --> 15:44.220]  while messing with it when I was awake after that.
[15:44.300 --> 15:47.700]  But yeah, the thing where like there was a seal issue on the side of my mouth
[15:47.700 --> 15:50.860]  and it was creating like that whistle foghorn sound,
[15:51.040 --> 15:53.640]  which is so much louder in person than the audio conveys.
[15:54.020 --> 15:57.000]  But it is insane coincidence to have the conversation we had
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.360]  and then me to turn into a human foghorn.
[15:59.560 --> 16:02.120]  Very funny.
[16:02.280 --> 16:06.220]  You you sound you sound like
[16:06.220 --> 16:15.420]  you sound like cinematic horn hits.
[16:16.760 --> 16:17.560]  Mystery sound.
[16:18.840 --> 16:20.240]  That's Andrew breathing at night.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.400]  There was a time, Gavin, you're a very busy man.
[16:24.580 --> 16:26.900]  There is a time where you took my gagging.
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.780]  I don't even remember what it was, but you put it to the Jurassic Park thing.
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.160]  If I find a trailer that uses that.
[16:33.420 --> 16:34.000]  Yes, I will.
[16:34.560 --> 16:35.460]  Oh, that would be great.
[16:35.820 --> 16:39.860]  Yeah, I put your I think you were sniffing the the batter bottle.
[16:40.300 --> 16:41.740]  Oh, and I put it over.
[16:41.900 --> 16:43.720]  I put that sound over velociraptors.
[16:43.720 --> 16:45.720]  But then I don't think we ever even posted it.
[16:45.880 --> 16:46.260]  No, we did.
[16:47.100 --> 16:48.460]  Maybe we should put that on the Patreon.
[16:48.920 --> 16:49.660]  Yeah, let's do it.
[16:49.760 --> 16:51.860]  Because we have a place to do it because we didn't want to do it
[16:51.860 --> 16:53.080]  for, I think, copyright reasons.
[16:53.280 --> 16:53.900]  Yeah, a little bonus.
[16:54.100 --> 16:55.260]  Oh, I'll tell you what, Andrew.
[16:55.720 --> 16:57.060]  I'll go ahead and get that clip.
[16:57.160 --> 16:59.100]  Tell you why? Because I kept it.
[17:03.100 --> 17:03.660]  Holy shit.
[17:04.180 --> 17:05.160]  Oh, this is good.
[17:05.400 --> 17:05.880]  This is good.
[17:06.500 --> 17:07.260]  You kept it.
[17:07.300 --> 17:09.060]  But the question is, is it uploaded anywhere?
[17:09.640 --> 17:10.960]  How accessible is it going to be?
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.200]  I don't know. I think that's a checkmate.
[17:13.720 --> 17:14.340]  That was pretty good.
[17:17.920 --> 17:19.280]  I love this podcast.
[17:19.740 --> 17:20.780]  It's a great time.
[17:21.520 --> 17:23.720]  I'm so fucking excited about all that stuff we were talking about
[17:23.720 --> 17:26.140]  that's coming up on the horizon that we have to figure out how to record.
[17:26.340 --> 17:28.840]  Everything we have to make is so delicious.
[17:29.580 --> 17:31.720]  You know, I'm just so fucking excited about it.
[17:31.980 --> 17:33.240]  I am equally. Yeah.
[17:33.720 --> 17:35.560]  It's all going to be so much fun to do.
[17:35.780 --> 17:38.000]  Oh, the thing I wanted to pitch.
[17:38.580 --> 17:39.600]  I'm just throwing this out there.
[17:39.920 --> 17:43.440]  You guys know how when you go to like a basketball game
[17:43.440 --> 17:46.740]  or a baseball game, they have like the owner's boxes and the suites
[17:46.740 --> 17:48.820]  that like corporations will rent out.
[17:48.920 --> 17:50.280]  It'd be like AT&T will have it.
[17:50.380 --> 17:52.980]  And then, you know, or like Warner Brothers would have one.
[17:53.060 --> 17:57.760]  And like Alan would take somebody to like a fucking UT game or whatever.
[17:57.880 --> 17:59.320]  Yeah, like a little schmooze cabinet.
[17:59.740 --> 18:02.680]  How much do those things cost for like a single A baseball team?
[18:03.000 --> 18:04.060]  Well, do they have them?
[18:04.300 --> 18:07.660]  Wouldn't it be cool if our company was able to acquire one of those
[18:07.660 --> 18:11.480]  or like in a hockey, like minor league hockey, like the least impressive?
[18:11.480 --> 18:13.740]  You're talking about like getting a box, right?
[18:13.960 --> 18:15.780]  Yeah, like renting a box. But like for a season.
[18:15.880 --> 18:17.360]  Like like for a season. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:17.460 --> 18:20.000]  For a season. For a season, it's got to be like six figures.
[18:20.380 --> 18:23.140]  No, no, not not not for like the level.
[18:23.400 --> 18:24.900]  Not for minor league sports.
[18:25.060 --> 18:26.200]  No, not for minor leagues.
[18:26.240 --> 18:26.700]  That's what I'm saying.
[18:26.800 --> 18:30.100]  If you go low, like Round Rock Express might be a little pricey
[18:30.100 --> 18:32.960]  because they're after like kind of like a high profile minor league team.
[18:33.800 --> 18:37.080]  There's got to be one out there that's criminally affordable.
[18:37.520 --> 18:38.260]  What if we get one?
[18:38.380 --> 18:40.400]  But that's the only place we could record the podcast.
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.460]  Well, that's was going to be my where I was going with it was
[18:43.460 --> 18:45.180]  then it would become a recording space.
[18:45.280 --> 18:46.320]  We could record episodes there.
[18:46.420 --> 18:49.920]  But there's always like the sound of people hitting dingers in the background.
[18:50.060 --> 18:53.100]  The crowd's like, hey, you can only record during a game.
[18:53.220 --> 18:56.020]  What about like the Austin Stars hockey team?
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.600]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[18:57.620 --> 18:58.700]  Oh, yeah. Like how?
[18:58.800 --> 19:01.540]  I wonder how much it is to get because you can get a party suite.
[19:02.820 --> 19:06.380]  Now you have to contact a ticket representative in order to get this information.
[19:06.380 --> 19:07.180]  I know, right?
[19:08.100 --> 19:08.940]  So stupid.
[19:09.900 --> 19:12.240]  I don't know. It sucks for Nick to have to do that.
[19:12.340 --> 19:14.280]  But I nominate him.
[19:14.600 --> 19:18.840]  Oh, God. Party suites can accommodate 20 to 70 guests
[19:18.840 --> 19:22.260]  and it'll just be four of us hanging out.
[19:23.940 --> 19:25.460]  And we'll put Andrew on an iPad.
[19:25.840 --> 19:27.340]  Yeah, absolutely. Oh, absolutely.
[19:27.420 --> 19:29.160]  Yeah. I mean, interesting.
[19:29.800 --> 19:30.640]  Very interesting.
[19:30.940 --> 19:34.560]  I think I think the big thing is it's you're trying to get like food and shit.
[19:34.780 --> 19:36.240]  Yeah, I think that's what they're trying to sell you on.
[19:36.240 --> 19:40.220]  That's not where we should be spending our money as a company.
[19:40.600 --> 19:44.100]  And I'm sure we don't have enough money to do it anyway.
[19:44.420 --> 19:49.720]  But I just throw that out there as like a, you know, lofty goals for someday
[19:49.720 --> 19:51.840]  where we could schmooze and take other public.
[19:51.960 --> 19:54.980]  We could be like, hey, Ray, you want to go hang out with us at our booth?
[19:55.320 --> 19:57.160]  And he'd be like, no, right?
[19:57.760 --> 19:58.620]  Who else do we know?
[19:58.820 --> 20:00.880]  Hey, Michael, do you want to go hang out with us at our booth?
[20:01.080 --> 20:03.620]  You're pie in the sky dream is guys.
[20:03.720 --> 20:06.060]  We got to get Ray to come to a game with us.
[20:06.060 --> 20:06.920]  Ray's a good get.
[20:07.380 --> 20:11.520]  The problem is I don't like to schmooze with people I don't know anymore.
[20:11.680 --> 20:13.640]  So my my pool is real limited.
[20:14.320 --> 20:17.020]  Oh, you want to you want to like butter up your close friends?
[20:17.400 --> 20:20.260]  Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's if it's if we don't invite Jeremy, I don't know.
[20:20.420 --> 20:21.280]  We're kind of I don't know.
[20:21.440 --> 20:22.800]  This is what we do. This is how we do it.
[20:22.900 --> 20:25.640]  You remember when back in the day where companies would just sponsor us
[20:25.640 --> 20:26.960]  to do something and they would have money
[20:26.960 --> 20:28.400]  and they wouldn't have any clue what to do with it
[20:28.400 --> 20:29.220]  and we'd have to come up with it.
[20:29.580 --> 20:32.360]  We just have the company that sponsors whatever we're doing in there
[20:32.360 --> 20:34.020]  to just to pay for that for a season.
[20:34.020 --> 20:35.500]  Maybe that vague.
[20:35.560 --> 20:36.800]  Oh, I bet Vegas would be too expensive.
[20:36.980 --> 20:39.620]  But there is that dude from the from the minor league
[20:39.620 --> 20:41.760]  Vegas team that reached out to me who works in the front office.
[20:42.100 --> 20:42.800]  Maybe he could.
[20:43.080 --> 20:46.140]  It just seems like a perfect thing to waste some corporation's money on
[20:46.140 --> 20:47.680]  instead of our patrons.
[20:49.300 --> 20:50.840]  Yeah, no, I totally agree.
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.160]  I don't want to waste patrons money on anything.
[20:52.240 --> 20:54.140]  That's never going to be like a down the road kind of thing.
[20:54.220 --> 20:56.760]  But yeah, there would be if we could trick like
[20:58.100 --> 21:01.120]  like a hot dog company, Oscar Mayer.
[21:02.320 --> 21:06.080]  I'm looking at the BC Lions, what their sweet boxes are.
[21:07.180 --> 21:11.820]  $215 per person is the most expensive minimum amount of people.
[21:12.580 --> 21:16.440]  Minimum amount of people looks like 14.
[21:16.880 --> 21:17.720]  OK, Jesus.
[21:18.540 --> 21:21.640]  I don't know 13 other people who would want to go to something like this with me.
[21:21.840 --> 21:25.360]  Pretty pricey, but like not like that's a measuring stick, I guess.
[21:25.940 --> 21:29.700]  It'd be interesting to see how a CFL team lines up with like a minor hockey team
[21:29.700 --> 21:33.060]  in terms of because you're also you're going to need to find a minor team
[21:33.060 --> 21:37.500]  that is in a pro arena to even have suites.
[21:37.640 --> 21:39.100]  That's that's an excellent point.
[21:39.500 --> 21:43.960]  So there's a level of prestige required even on the smaller league scale.
[21:44.360 --> 21:48.920]  We just have to find the shittiest prestige team across all sports.
[21:49.480 --> 21:51.620]  Just a market that does not care.
[21:51.660 --> 21:52.660]  But they have a team.
[21:53.040 --> 21:56.580]  I was going to say Florida feels like I was about to say like hockey in Florida.
[21:56.740 --> 21:58.260]  Yeah, they're so good.
[21:58.260 --> 22:01.120]  It's so frustrating how good the Florida how good they are
[22:01.120 --> 22:03.600]  and how nobody in Florida gives a shit. It's so upsetting.
[22:05.560 --> 22:08.800]  Thank you so much to ZocDoc for sponsoring regulation podcast.
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.580]  I think we've all been there.
[22:10.860 --> 22:12.960]  Booking a doctor appointment can feel so daunting.
[22:13.400 --> 22:15.800]  It can be a massive headache to just start the process.
[22:15.960 --> 22:17.360]  It can feel incredibly daunting.
[22:17.480 --> 22:20.440]  But thanks to ZocDoc, there's no reason to delay.

[23:50.320 --> 23:52.700]  Thanks to Bear Mattress for supporting Regulation Podcast.
[23:52.900 --> 23:53.860]  Here's the thing about sleep.
[23:53.860 --> 23:55.200]  It's important. You know that.
[23:55.360 --> 23:56.780]  I know that. We all know that.
[23:56.860 --> 24:00.820]  But getting the best sleep is hard when you have the wrong mattress,
[24:00.940 --> 24:03.880]  when you have night sweats, when you snore, when there's motion transfer.
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.320]  My sleep preferences, sleep on my stomach, sleep on my side.
[24:07.340 --> 24:08.200]  Oh, you go to sleep on your back.
[24:08.240 --> 24:10.860]  I don't do that because with my old mattress, it wasn't comfortable.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.440]  With Bear Mattress, I can sleep any way I want to.

[24:47.060 --> 24:49.080]  And now I don't because of Bear Mattress.
[24:49.080 --> 24:52.340]  82% of customers saw an improvement in their sleep quality
[24:52.340 --> 24:53.480]  with their Bear Mattress.

[25:43.740 --> 25:44.760]  Rawr. Thanks, Bear.
[25:47.140 --> 25:51.320]  I have a thing to bring up that I, this will be an interesting,
[25:52.460 --> 25:56.220]  interesting reaction for me to see, because I, I said something
[25:56.220 --> 25:59.400]  and I was told that I needed to bring it up here.
[25:59.700 --> 26:00.280]  Uh-oh.
[26:00.720 --> 26:02.500]  Because I felt very confident about it.
[26:02.700 --> 26:05.120]  Once again, related kind of my CPAP stuff.
[26:05.480 --> 26:08.440]  I have a mask now that is just nose.
[26:08.720 --> 26:11.640]  My other mask was nose and like covered the nose and mouth.
[26:11.920 --> 26:13.760]  This is just a nose mask.
[26:14.320 --> 26:16.720]  I'm trying to figure out like what works best for me.
[26:17.080 --> 26:20.820]  And I was talking about the perks of having just a nose mask
[26:20.820 --> 26:24.400]  as opposed to the face and nose being covered or the mouth.
[26:24.720 --> 26:27.980]  And one of the perks I said was I will now be able
[26:27.980 --> 26:29.420]  to sneeze without fear.
[26:29.700 --> 26:33.600]  And which I was told that sneezing is a nose thing
[26:34.020 --> 26:36.980]  as much as it is a mouth thing, which I disagreed on.
[26:37.260 --> 26:38.500]  Well, I think we've talked about this before
[26:39.180 --> 26:40.660]  because I'm a mouth sneezer always.
[26:40.660 --> 26:43.660]  Yeah, I'm a mouth sneeze. I'm a violent mouth sneezer.
[26:43.840 --> 26:46.580]  I prefer it through the mouth. Otherwise, sometimes my ears pop.
[26:46.920 --> 26:49.520]  I didn't even really... I'm such a mouth sneezer.
[26:49.680 --> 26:51.740]  I can't even really imagine nose sneezing.
[26:51.820 --> 26:53.500]  I think I'm only a nose sneezer.
[26:53.840 --> 26:54.240]  Really?
[26:54.700 --> 26:55.840]  So you fire out loogies sometimes.
[26:56.220 --> 26:58.020]  I'm definitely more of a nose sneezer big time.
[26:58.280 --> 27:01.140]  Not loogies, but I've definitely sneezed like particles.
[27:01.780 --> 27:01.800]  Yeah.
[27:03.620 --> 27:04.500]  That's wild.
[27:04.960 --> 27:09.040]  I think I, at a young age, started redirecting them through the mouth hole.
[27:09.040 --> 27:12.500]  And it like scares me to get them back through the nose.
[27:12.580 --> 27:15.460]  When I sneeze, it's like a dragon spitting fire.
[27:15.740 --> 27:19.400]  Like it is. I'm just sending everything out via the mouth.
[27:19.600 --> 27:22.260]  It's messy, but I'm covering it with my shoulders.
[27:22.380 --> 27:25.020]  So it's fine. But like, if I wasn't, there's spray everywhere.
[27:25.380 --> 27:27.800]  Isn't the point of the sneeze to clear the nose?
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.160]  Yeah, I think it is.
[27:30.420 --> 27:33.840]  Yeah. Like when the counterpoint was explained to me, I was like, yeah,
[27:33.900 --> 27:35.480]  I think that's all correct.
[27:35.760 --> 27:38.160]  I mean, isn't the tickle in the nose? Right.
[27:38.160 --> 27:38.920]  Yeah, I thought so.
[27:39.340 --> 27:42.700]  I feel like that's the light of the fuse is how I feel about it.
[27:42.740 --> 27:44.640]  Yeah, you just choose where to fire. You choose where to aim it on the way out.
[27:44.660 --> 27:45.760]  Oh, dude, I'll be honest.
[27:45.800 --> 27:48.300]  I don't think I have the ability to sneeze out of my mouth.
[27:48.420 --> 27:49.040]  I think I'm...
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.160]  I could definitely do it.
[27:50.220 --> 27:53.580]  But what what we're saying is that if it's in the nose
[27:53.580 --> 27:57.840]  and it's trying to clear the nose, redirecting it to the mouth does you no good, right?
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.180]  Well, it does the trick.
[27:59.320 --> 28:02.000]  I don't need to... I mean, I get the satisfaction from it.
[28:02.100 --> 28:05.480]  Maybe that's why I sneeze three times every time I sneeze.
[28:05.480 --> 28:06.620]  Because I'm not being effective at it.
[28:06.680 --> 28:08.900]  Because you're not doing anything to fix it.
[28:09.220 --> 28:11.120]  Yeah, you'll notice this after a while.
[28:11.180 --> 28:12.120]  Just like, forget it.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.720]  Yeah, I give up.
[28:15.560 --> 28:16.980]  I never thought about that.
[28:17.760 --> 28:19.680]  You're like, ah, I need to stretch my legs.
[28:19.980 --> 28:22.000]  Ah, sorry, I thought yelling would help.
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.920]  I actually do yell at the same time as my... as the sneeze.
[28:26.920 --> 28:27.920]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[28:28.520 --> 28:29.660]  I like it when it's like, pshah!
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.060]  And it's like, really feels like everything's flying out of your head.
[28:33.180 --> 28:33.420]  Yep.
[28:33.700 --> 28:34.420]  Oh, I got to be honest.
[28:34.420 --> 28:35.440]  I kind of like a sneeze.
[28:35.900 --> 28:40.180]  I try to sneeze as loud as humanly possible because it annoys the shit out of my wife.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.120]  Yeah, me too.
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.840]  I've started doing those real, like, dad sneezes, too, where I'm like, sat on the couch and I sneeze.
[28:46.920 --> 28:53.700]  And I sort of curl up real quick in the fetal position for a brief second to the point where it's like,
[28:53.760 --> 28:57.400]  I don't go full fetal, but the force of it kind of lifts me off the couch a little bit.
[28:57.560 --> 29:00.320]  I actually get little bits of air when I when I do a good sneeze.
[29:00.700 --> 29:01.060]  Really?
[29:01.660 --> 29:01.820]  Yeah.
[29:01.820 --> 29:02.300]  Wow.
[29:03.480 --> 29:05.520]  Oh, that sounds fun. Maybe I'll incorporate that.
[29:05.820 --> 29:06.560]  I enjoy a sneeze.
[29:06.840 --> 29:07.700]  I think it's fun.
[29:08.100 --> 29:08.740]  I love them.
[29:08.920 --> 29:09.440]  I have a good time.
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.520]  But I think my nose is too vacuous to direct all the air through.
[29:14.520 --> 29:16.580]  I think I would like my brain would come out or something.
[29:18.040 --> 29:18.400]  Yeah.
[29:18.620 --> 29:20.040]  A big chunk of something.
[29:22.540 --> 29:23.780]  Sneeze out a part of your brain.
[29:23.940 --> 29:24.800]  Just like a little chunk.
[29:25.060 --> 29:27.180]  How scary would that be if I just sneezed in front of you?
[29:27.320 --> 29:28.880]  A little piece of hamburger meat came out.
[29:28.880 --> 29:33.040]  Yeah, just a little bit of brain was hanging out of the nostril.
[29:33.560 --> 29:34.520]  I have a question for you, Kevin.
[29:35.460 --> 29:35.580]  Yeah.
[29:35.740 --> 29:36.840]  Nose related, nose, mouth, hair.
[29:38.640 --> 29:43.400]  If we lit 10 candles and put them in a row, two sets of 10 candles.
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.020]  Yeah.
[29:44.140 --> 29:46.280]  Do you think you blow out with your mouth faster?
[29:46.320 --> 29:47.940]  All of the candles or your nose?
[29:48.260 --> 29:49.080]  What's more powerful?
[29:49.620 --> 29:49.960]  Mouth.
[29:50.340 --> 29:50.700]  Really?
[29:51.080 --> 29:53.020]  Yeah, the nose is a nightmare.
[29:53.560 --> 29:54.600]  Really? In what way?
[29:54.660 --> 29:56.020]  Because I assume it's surgical.
[29:56.480 --> 29:58.660]  I just have very little control over the valves.
[29:58.660 --> 30:00.960]  Like sometimes I'm trying to blow out through my nose
[30:00.960 --> 30:03.040]  and then suddenly it's like, and it just goes shut.
[30:03.160 --> 30:03.980]  And then my ears hurt.
[30:04.140 --> 30:05.440]  And then it like comes out my throat.
[30:05.700 --> 30:07.160]  I've got no control over it.
[30:08.160 --> 30:09.920]  How are you getting on with that with the nose only?
[30:10.100 --> 30:13.100]  Are you discovering what it sounds like when your mouth comes open?
[30:13.480 --> 30:14.560]  Yeah, it's terrifying.
[30:15.080 --> 30:18.500]  I'll be sleeping and then I'll wake up very suddenly, very scared
[30:18.500 --> 30:22.300]  because my mouth has opened up during the night and it's going.
[30:23.680 --> 30:24.240]  Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
[30:24.240 --> 30:29.560]  I like it when James Bond stabs someone's scuba tube in Thunderball
[30:29.560 --> 30:30.320]  and you just hear like.
[30:32.000 --> 30:34.900]  Yes, it's I'm missing around the settings.
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.660]  I definitely feel like I need to reduce
[30:38.180 --> 30:41.980]  the the amount of pressure that's being currently shot through.
[30:43.060 --> 30:46.640]  Because the first time I tried it, I felt like I had a nosebleed
[30:46.640 --> 30:49.720]  after about an hour, like I did not feel good.
[30:49.720 --> 30:51.080]  I just I don't know.
[30:51.260 --> 30:54.680]  Funneling high powered air through your nose is a lot.
[30:55.520 --> 30:56.720]  It's taking some getting used to.
[30:56.980 --> 30:58.620]  It does not at any point feel natural.
[30:59.080 --> 31:00.800]  No. But you sleep well.
[31:02.120 --> 31:04.000]  OK. Better than before?
[31:04.460 --> 31:05.640]  Less dangerous than before.
[31:06.100 --> 31:07.160]  Well, that's good. Yeah.
[31:07.260 --> 31:10.260]  Not having like disturbances or whatever, but it's just.
[31:10.340 --> 31:12.720]  Yeah, definitely a little bit of a learning curve.
[31:13.400 --> 31:16.260]  I think I had a false start
[31:16.660 --> 31:20.120]  because I hadn't slept well and probably like 10 months.
[31:21.080 --> 31:23.280]  So that first one where I came in late for Mario Party
[31:23.280 --> 31:27.520]  gave me a perception of this is super easy and I'm just going to be great at this.
[31:27.720 --> 31:31.520]  And it's been, I think, as I said at that time, a little bit of a learning process
[31:31.520 --> 31:33.220]  of, oh, how does like normal sleep work?
[31:34.100 --> 31:35.920]  What do what do you do with with naps?
[31:35.960 --> 31:39.040]  Do you get all plugged in for a nap or do you just nap like normal?
[31:39.400 --> 31:44.160]  I so when I wasn't sleeping at all, I would need to nap throughout the day
[31:44.160 --> 31:45.600]  or at least have one nap a day.
[31:47.120 --> 31:48.280]  So later in the evening.
[31:48.740 --> 31:49.920]  I'm glad you're fixing it.
[31:50.240 --> 31:52.740]  Yeah. Now, now it's like that has been the biggest change of like,
[31:52.760 --> 31:53.720]  oh, I don't need to nap at all.
[31:54.160 --> 31:55.120]  Naps are good for you, though.
[31:55.440 --> 31:57.100]  Yeah, they are. Especially the older you get.
[31:57.340 --> 32:00.600]  I think I think probably the way Andrew was sleeping and everything,
[32:00.940 --> 32:02.520]  it wasn't really a good for you thing.
[32:02.580 --> 32:03.000]  You know what I mean?
[32:03.020 --> 32:03.660]  No, no, no, no, no.
[32:03.940 --> 32:08.020]  And also like positive napping versus like needing like I was.
[32:08.020 --> 32:08.940]  It was required napping.
[32:09.220 --> 32:11.960]  Yeah. Saying I think probably calling what I was doing
[32:11.960 --> 32:14.540]  napping is maybe a little inaccurate.
[32:14.540 --> 32:16.980]  What was your percentage of hate naps?
[32:17.560 --> 32:18.300]  Oh, man.
[32:18.800 --> 32:19.500]  Not often.
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.540]  I haven't hate napped in a while.
[32:23.080 --> 32:26.740]  You know, it's funny is that like the start of hate napping was I was just wrong.
[32:27.220 --> 32:30.720]  Like I was so mad that they drafted a certain player and that player
[32:30.720 --> 32:33.160]  has been like the best player on the franchise in the franchise
[32:33.160 --> 32:34.860]  for like the past eight years.
[32:35.100 --> 32:37.320]  I like that you had full hate nap on something
[32:37.320 --> 32:40.120]  that was completely outside of your life and beyond your control.
[32:40.440 --> 32:41.740]  That's what being a sports fan is.
[32:41.740 --> 32:42.080]  I don't know.
[32:42.860 --> 32:44.980]  That's literally all sports.
[32:45.660 --> 32:46.800]  Yep. I mean, I get that.
[32:46.860 --> 32:50.000]  I get like I'm getting emotionally involved, but I'm surprised
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.160]  you weren't hate napping more for stuff in your own life.
[32:52.600 --> 32:54.740]  No, I, you know, I don't know.
[32:55.340 --> 32:58.660]  And I guess I like to settle things in a healthier way
[32:58.660 --> 33:02.660]  that that's actually impactful as opposed to sports where it's like,
[33:02.740 --> 33:05.900]  oh, there's no amount of like personal
[33:07.420 --> 33:11.200]  working through this issue that like this ultimately doesn't matter.
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.700]  I'm just very angry at this at this time.
[33:13.140 --> 33:14.760]  Yeah, I mean, that's probably a good thing that you weren't hate
[33:14.760 --> 33:15.920]  napping real life events.
[33:16.060 --> 33:19.400]  You just have I hate to have real life events.
[33:19.660 --> 33:21.560]  I know. Boy, I don't think that works.
[33:21.920 --> 33:24.180]  I think you would have taken a lot of a lot of hate naps
[33:24.180 --> 33:25.980]  after Mario Party if you were doing that.
[33:27.600 --> 33:31.640]  Oh, man, I am so on the fence about sharing
[33:32.240 --> 33:34.880]  because I oh, you know, I got to do it for content reasons.
[33:34.940 --> 33:36.420]  I have to do it now. You can't.
[33:36.460 --> 33:37.500]  Well, hold on. This is great.
[33:37.960 --> 33:38.920]  This is do it.
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.260]  What are you about to share?
[33:40.820 --> 33:42.820]  What are you going to share something related to Mario Party?
[33:43.340 --> 33:44.580]  But it's not over for us yet.
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.720]  But we need to know. Yeah, I know.
[33:46.740 --> 33:49.280]  But it's going to be way over by the time this comes out.
[33:49.480 --> 33:53.840]  And I think you're just remember, we're about to play against you in the morning.
[33:54.060 --> 33:57.540]  I know. That's why I'm saying like for content reasons, it's the move.
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.140]  But for like strategy, it's not.
[33:59.560 --> 34:01.780]  But it's got more content group.
[34:01.960 --> 34:03.480]  Let's let's do the content thing.
[34:04.460 --> 34:08.920]  I and my math is probably very wrong, but I was tired one night
[34:08.920 --> 34:11.800]  and I looked up all of the bonus stars
[34:12.470 --> 34:14.500]  and like what the requirements were for them.
[34:14.880 --> 34:16.760]  And then I picked five of those.
[34:16.900 --> 34:19.540]  There's like six or seven different bonus star options.
[34:19.920 --> 34:21.240]  Maybe a little bit more like eight.
[34:21.520 --> 34:26.220]  But I picked like five of them and I watched every turn of Mario Party
[34:26.220 --> 34:30.780]  and I counted each thing to the best of my ability.
[34:31.180 --> 34:32.620]  What the fuck?
[34:32.760 --> 34:38.500]  So I have how many spaces we've all moved, how many items we've all used,
[34:38.500 --> 34:44.000]  how many Bowser spaces we've all landed on, how many green spaces we've all landed on.
[34:44.320 --> 34:48.020]  And this is something that in three days the game will do for us.
[34:48.360 --> 34:52.440]  Yeah, but I was trying to figure out, like, is there things that because I
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.120]  if I have any chance and my chance of succeeding or winning in this thing
[34:56.120 --> 34:57.900]  is zero point zero one.
[34:58.020 --> 35:02.760]  But is there anything I can do to potentially cover myself
[35:02.760 --> 35:04.240]  in a bonus star situation?
[35:04.240 --> 35:08.320]  Because I'm going to need all three of those things if I have any chance.
[35:08.500 --> 35:11.480]  Which is not it's almost impossible as it stands.
[35:11.800 --> 35:14.900]  So going into the last four turns,
[35:15.520 --> 35:19.300]  I had a two mini game lead over Nick.
[35:19.860 --> 35:20.800]  Nick was in second.
[35:21.220 --> 35:24.780]  And so yesterday when we did it, I thought, as long as if I win one,
[35:25.120 --> 35:27.860]  the worst that'll happen is he could tie me if he wins out.
[35:28.300 --> 35:31.520]  I just need him to not win or do whatever.
[35:32.060 --> 35:36.180]  As long as I win or he doesn't win and I just need to win once, I'm fine.
[35:36.680 --> 35:37.680]  Nick won yesterday.
[35:38.060 --> 35:39.540]  I lost today.
[35:40.160 --> 35:46.200]  We did another mini game in which I needed only one coin to technically win.
[35:47.060 --> 35:51.140]  And because Gavin was such a shit stomping on my head,
[35:51.200 --> 35:53.020]  he prevented me from doing so.
[35:53.920 --> 35:55.480]  So I've lost the next two.
[35:55.660 --> 35:56.760]  There are too many games left.
[35:56.840 --> 35:59.120]  Nick and I are currently tied if my math is correct.
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.540]  It the worst case scenario in these mini games has come forward
[36:03.540 --> 36:05.180]  or it was like two days ago.
[36:05.180 --> 36:10.000]  It was, man, if I just win one of these and as long as he doesn't win all of them,
[36:10.600 --> 36:11.480]  everything's fine.
[36:11.720 --> 36:13.060]  And I have lost.
[36:13.280 --> 36:15.400]  And Nick has won two in a row.
[36:15.620 --> 36:17.420]  And it is not looking good.
[36:17.800 --> 36:18.540]  It's concerning.
[36:18.920 --> 36:22.940]  Well, I told you when you when you crossed me five turns early,
[36:22.980 --> 36:24.200]  I told you Dilkong is dead.
[36:24.560 --> 36:25.120]  That's true.
[36:25.700 --> 36:27.440]  You did say that. And it did play out that way.
[36:27.540 --> 36:29.020]  You shouldn't have told me that, man.
[36:29.160 --> 36:30.700]  Oh, boy. Yeah.
[36:30.740 --> 36:33.040]  Oh, listen, I'm it's going to be fun.
[36:33.320 --> 36:34.120]  These next two turns.
[36:34.120 --> 36:37.500]  I am rooting for you so much to land on a chance time right at the end of the game.
[36:37.880 --> 36:39.060]  I think it'd be so exciting.
[36:39.220 --> 36:40.360]  I think so, too.
[36:40.720 --> 36:41.320]  It would be great.
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.100]  But yeah, I did my best to look into all the things
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.340]  and maybe some of the moves that you guys are like, why would you do that?
[36:49.440 --> 36:51.640]  Maybe that is the influence of I'm looking at.
[36:51.720 --> 36:53.920]  I'm looking at stats that maybe you're not thinking about.
[36:54.360 --> 36:55.480]  Need to get those items down.
[36:55.920 --> 36:57.240]  Andrew's over here playing Moneyball.
[36:57.640 --> 37:01.020]  Is that why you took Star Steals instead of the dice?
[37:01.020 --> 37:05.240]  It was a factor of like, I get to do two of these as opposed to just one.
[37:05.820 --> 37:07.220]  Interesting. All right.
[37:07.860 --> 37:10.400]  Didn't work out. Hasn't worked out.
[37:12.620 --> 37:15.120]  I don't like when I look at the data.
[37:15.960 --> 37:18.400]  I don't know how you have such a lead because you're not winning
[37:18.400 --> 37:19.300]  in any of the categories.
[37:21.240 --> 37:23.920]  It's the most like.
[37:24.140 --> 37:24.880]  Booze on the map.
[37:25.360 --> 37:26.760]  Who cares about the bonus stars?
[37:27.020 --> 37:28.800]  That's fair. It's just it's so funny.
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.940]  We're like, when I betrayed you at turn 15, things were looking so fine.
[37:33.200 --> 37:36.860]  And I have one star, which I expect to lose tomorrow.
[37:37.560 --> 37:40.060]  Anyway, it's going to be, I think, funny to listen to this
[37:40.060 --> 37:43.140]  because the audience will have fully seen what happens.
[37:43.240 --> 37:47.960]  And we're still two days out from getting the end results, which I can't wait for.
[37:48.460 --> 37:54.260]  It's going to be so weird to wake up not with you guys on day 31.
[37:55.760 --> 37:57.900]  It is going to be a strange experience.
[37:57.900 --> 37:59.280]  It's become a nice routine.
[37:59.540 --> 38:01.000]  Yeah, it really has.
[38:01.120 --> 38:02.080]  I like waking up early.
[38:02.160 --> 38:03.240]  I like making my little coffee.
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.580]  I like squirting out a little Mario party turn and then going for a nice morning poo.
[38:07.980 --> 38:11.860]  It definitely is nice to feel productive right out the gate.
[38:12.160 --> 38:14.060]  Yeah, like it gets you ramped up for the day.
[38:14.380 --> 38:17.380]  I'm really excited to play just a normal 30 turn game
[38:17.380 --> 38:18.780]  to see how that feels in comparison.
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.840]  Yeah. Yeah, I definitely don't ever want to play Mario Party again.
[38:23.060 --> 38:26.340]  Why? You unlocked all the levels, all the cool levels.
[38:26.340 --> 38:28.280]  We have to play the cool levels that you unlocked.
[38:28.500 --> 38:30.320]  Yeah, we got to play the Bowser level.
[38:30.480 --> 38:33.120]  I did. I unlocked all those levels for sure.
[38:33.260 --> 38:36.980]  This is I've had a lot of 30 turn Mario parties in the last couple
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.880]  in the last like four weeks or so.
[38:39.240 --> 38:44.400]  I have I have some new updates from Meg on where Andrew has lost her.
[38:44.700 --> 38:47.320]  Oh, no gains. All lost.
[38:48.140 --> 38:49.960]  There was one one thing she agreed with you.
[38:50.000 --> 38:51.760]  She says, OK, I don't really remember what this is.
[38:51.800 --> 38:53.860]  She said Red Bull is butts up.
[38:54.320 --> 38:55.320]  OK, no, that's fair.
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.220]  That that is the the game in school where you have to run and touch the wall.
[39:00.260 --> 39:03.700]  And if you the ball hits before you touch it, you have to stand
[39:03.700 --> 39:04.900]  and get pelted by a ball.
[39:05.000 --> 39:06.900]  But it's like differently named.
[39:07.180 --> 39:08.100]  Yeah, butts up.
[39:08.480 --> 39:09.560]  Yeah, for me, it was Red Bull.
[39:10.100 --> 39:14.060]  She also does not agree with any of your bathroom food.
[39:14.500 --> 39:16.260]  Yeah, no, that's fair. Once again, reasonable.
[39:16.520 --> 39:19.120]  Does not care for your under the desk hot dogs,
[39:19.780 --> 39:22.420]  your blind wiping and Winnie the Poohing.
[39:22.860 --> 39:24.280]  She's deeply disturbed by all that.
[39:24.280 --> 39:26.820]  I will say, I think that's maybe where I went wrong in Mario Party
[39:26.820 --> 39:30.380]  because I was naked for probably like the first 15 turns of Mario.
[39:30.600 --> 39:30.820]  What do you mean?
[39:31.100 --> 39:34.320]  Really happening to the primal Dilkong roots.
[39:34.760 --> 39:38.440]  Hang on. And then you were you were just naked with like a red tie on with a tire.
[39:39.120 --> 39:40.260]  I wish you know what?
[39:40.260 --> 39:41.980]  I need to get a red tie and I have a red tie.
[39:42.300 --> 39:43.320]  Why would you be naked?
[39:43.800 --> 39:45.980]  I just roll out of bed naked and
[39:48.220 --> 39:49.800]  like no boxes or anything.
[39:50.300 --> 39:51.020]  What? No, nothing.
[39:51.020 --> 39:54.020]  Oh, it's happened in my Kong, inner Kong.
[39:54.280 --> 39:55.580]  What about your chair, though?
[39:55.920 --> 39:57.600]  That's got to be dirty butt chair now.
[39:57.880 --> 39:59.400]  No, I got like a blanket on the chair.
[39:59.680 --> 40:00.760]  Dirty blanket. Cozy.
[40:01.140 --> 40:02.580]  It's because the blanket gets washed.
[40:02.860 --> 40:04.480]  What's dirty about his butt?
[40:04.580 --> 40:05.520]  It was just in bed.
[40:05.860 --> 40:07.180]  Yeah, it was just in bed.
[40:07.580 --> 40:08.180]  It's dirty.
[40:08.780 --> 40:09.880]  I don't think it is.
[40:10.160 --> 40:11.160]  I don't think it is.
[40:11.300 --> 40:14.260]  I think it's as clean as if you if you what?
[40:14.320 --> 40:15.020]  I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[40:15.300 --> 40:17.580]  Well, a sleeping butt is cleaner than a sitting butt.
[40:18.320 --> 40:23.140]  But if you roll out of bed and then sit down on a chair, I don't know how the
[40:23.140 --> 40:24.580]  what's getting dirty here.
[40:24.740 --> 40:25.860]  You are the chair chair.
[40:25.980 --> 40:28.340]  It's like it's a more spread butt when you're sitting.
[40:28.700 --> 40:33.720]  So you're transferring your clean bed butt to the chair
[40:33.720 --> 40:34.960]  and that somehow gets it dirty.
[40:35.360 --> 40:38.740]  Well, if you're because I should be not going to have a shower every night, right?
[40:39.160 --> 40:40.180]  What? The bath.
[40:40.540 --> 40:42.680]  Are you washing your anus every night before bed?
[40:42.840 --> 40:44.460]  He lives in the bathtub, dude.
[40:44.820 --> 40:46.680]  Oh, fuck it. We're on a run, guys.
[40:46.680 --> 40:49.040]  He's in the bathtub like 11 hours a day.
[40:49.160 --> 40:51.060]  He's the cleanest human being on earth.
[40:51.380 --> 40:54.060]  You know, I had a little bit of a loss with that recently.
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.780]  I was in the tub and an earthquake hit when I was in the tub a few weeks ago.
[41:00.200 --> 41:01.540]  You didn't mention this? What the fuck?
[41:02.060 --> 41:04.360]  How many episodes has it been since that happened?
[41:04.740 --> 41:06.680]  Probably like five or six.
[41:06.820 --> 41:07.300]  It's been a while.
[41:08.160 --> 41:11.040]  So I had a bath and there was a tub quake
[41:11.640 --> 41:13.060]  and I got out of the tub.
[41:13.060 --> 41:17.540]  And then later that day, I looked in the tub
[41:17.540 --> 41:20.240]  and the side of the tub had cracked for me
[41:20.920 --> 41:23.300]  with being filled with water in the tub.
[41:23.440 --> 41:25.960]  And so I had to I had to give up the tub for a bit.
[41:26.220 --> 41:28.260]  And it was a tough time till he got repaired.
[41:28.480 --> 41:29.740]  So you had to get your tub repaired?
[41:30.060 --> 41:30.920]  Yeah. Wow.
[41:31.160 --> 41:34.460]  Took about three weeks of no tubbing.
[41:34.760 --> 41:37.020]  So was that the worst three weeks of your life?
[41:37.520 --> 41:37.960]  Definitely.
[41:39.000 --> 41:42.120]  I think my my my skin didn't know what happened.
[41:44.300 --> 41:46.180]  My skin was very confused.
[41:46.560 --> 41:47.680]  What do you mean?
[41:48.220 --> 41:51.580]  Because, you know, you get like pruney feet and whatnot if you're in the tub.
[41:52.120 --> 41:54.940]  Yeah. So there is no prunage.
[41:56.460 --> 41:59.460]  There's no prunage for like three weeks and it's not used to that.
[41:59.540 --> 42:01.420]  So I think my my skin was probably confused.
[42:01.740 --> 42:03.580]  It was the first time in all these years that you haven't been
[42:03.580 --> 42:05.620]  in a permanent state of damp.
[42:06.680 --> 42:09.600]  Well, not, you know, I'm a water guy.
[42:10.260 --> 42:11.860]  So I'm having showers and whatnot.
[42:11.860 --> 42:14.160]  But no, just a soak?
[42:14.320 --> 42:17.460]  No, it's been a while since I had that streak broken.
[42:17.800 --> 42:19.700]  But what was your tub made of that it cracked?
[42:19.840 --> 42:20.660]  Isn't it made of metal?
[42:21.360 --> 42:22.600]  No. What? No.
[42:23.300 --> 42:24.760]  Fiberglass, probably. Yeah.
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.440]  Do you have metal tubs?
[42:26.540 --> 42:27.540]  Do you have a metal tub?
[42:27.980 --> 42:30.660]  Uh, probably not. Fucking metal tubs over here.
[42:31.060 --> 42:32.560]  You're just guessing it, shit.
[42:33.180 --> 42:35.500]  Well, I remember maybe as a kid, I had a metal tub.
[42:35.580 --> 42:37.040]  Like I remember something got dropped in it.
[42:37.060 --> 42:40.220]  It cracked some of the ceramic material off and there was metal.
[42:40.220 --> 42:44.800]  Oh, Gavin's melting his tub down to make a weapon like the Mandalorian.
[42:45.900 --> 42:47.440]  Uh, rewinding it a little bit.
[42:47.520 --> 42:50.240]  You said you woke up naked and played Mario Party.
[42:50.500 --> 42:52.700]  Geoff did a shirt off Mario Party.
[42:52.780 --> 42:55.520]  But Geoff's thing didn't have anything to do with him getting out of bed.
[42:55.580 --> 42:56.320]  He just did it.
[42:56.860 --> 43:00.160]  Um, I went and saw a movie yesterday called Black Bag,
[43:00.320 --> 43:02.420]  a Steven Soderbergh movie that I really enjoyed.
[43:03.460 --> 43:04.960]  And everyone's very rich.
[43:05.180 --> 43:09.620]  And, uh, the thing that they wear sort of in a bunch of these scenes
[43:09.620 --> 43:11.300]  is what I call rich people pajamas.
[43:11.440 --> 43:12.780]  Oh, yeah. Those are rich people pajamas.
[43:12.980 --> 43:15.060]  Yeah. Do you guys have these? Are they comfortable?
[43:15.440 --> 43:17.440]  What am I missing about rich people pajamas?
[43:17.560 --> 43:19.660]  Because this looks so uncomfortable to sleep in.
[43:20.020 --> 43:25.540]  I do have not that exact pair, but I have some that are cut the same.
[43:25.600 --> 43:26.340]  They're the same material.
[43:26.680 --> 43:27.660]  Do you sleep in them?
[43:27.840 --> 43:30.180]  I have that exact pair.
[43:30.560 --> 43:31.140]  Do you really?
[43:31.460 --> 43:33.240]  I think I think it was for a video.
[43:33.420 --> 43:35.840]  I think it was for a pajama based video.
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.720]  So are they like, I guess my question for rich people pajamas,
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.120]  are they so comfortable you can't help but fall asleep?
[43:45.480 --> 43:51.100]  Because I can't imagine sleeping in what looks like pants and a shirt.
[43:51.320 --> 43:53.220]  Yeah, I can't. I can't get out.
[43:53.260 --> 43:54.160]  I need boxes only.
[43:54.460 --> 43:55.080]  Yeah, me too.
[43:55.360 --> 43:59.820]  I think it's more for like tooling around the last like hour to your wake.
[43:59.940 --> 44:03.300]  I have them because Emily is super into pajamas, right?
[44:03.580 --> 44:05.300]  Because of her whole sleep routine.
[44:05.300 --> 44:08.480]  So every time she buys a nice pair, she buys a pair for me, too.
[44:09.020 --> 44:11.500]  And I definitely like there's a couple of points at the evening
[44:11.500 --> 44:14.560]  at like eight or nine o'clock where you just like throw those on
[44:14.560 --> 44:16.040]  and then you just kind of chill.
[44:16.380 --> 44:18.760]  And it's just like a more comfortable way to hang out.
[44:18.820 --> 44:20.800]  You're like sitting on top of the bed, watching TV.
[44:20.940 --> 44:24.660]  And then when it's time to go to bed, then you just take the the pajama top off.
[44:24.760 --> 44:28.160]  That's that's where I'm hung up, because what you're describing, I do.
[44:28.380 --> 44:32.640]  I'm in like, you know, some pajama shorts and like a big T-shirt.
[44:32.640 --> 44:33.820]  And who cares like right now?
[44:33.900 --> 44:35.380]  Because I already did the stuff that I had to do today.
[44:35.380 --> 44:36.460]  That's like out of the house.
[44:36.720 --> 44:38.680]  So that's fine. I understand that.
[44:39.100 --> 44:42.680]  Watching this movie, it's like Michael Fassbender being very rich
[44:42.680 --> 44:46.000]  and wearing these pajamas, but like getting into bed
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.500]  and going to sleep with his wife with these pajamas on.
[44:48.660 --> 44:51.260]  And the whole it happens like three or four times in the movie.
[44:51.300 --> 44:53.120]  And I just keep going, no fucking way.
[44:53.200 --> 44:55.060]  There's no way you're sleeping in that stuff.
[44:55.360 --> 44:56.900]  Do any of them have the hat as well?
[44:57.240 --> 44:59.240]  Well, he's hot. His honk shoot ass. Yeah.
[45:00.400 --> 45:02.280]  He also has like a little candle holder.
[45:02.280 --> 45:05.280]  So he gets up and...
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.880]  I wonder if it happens more in the movies because of just ease.
[45:11.300 --> 45:12.700]  You don't have to take his shirt off.
[45:13.040 --> 45:15.980]  You don't have to like have that make sense in the background.
[45:16.260 --> 45:18.760]  But he's like, he's got to be he's got to be ripped.
[45:19.100 --> 45:19.760]  I'm sure he is.
[45:19.840 --> 45:22.940]  Maybe it's also like a thing where a lot of actors and actresses like
[45:22.940 --> 45:26.500]  it's like less nudity, which maybe is, you know, an issue for some actors
[45:26.500 --> 45:29.660]  and actresses who don't want to be gratuitously nude for no reason.
[45:29.720 --> 45:31.120]  Not that it's nude, but you know what I mean?
[45:31.120 --> 45:33.180]  Like, I don't know. No, I get it.
[45:33.200 --> 45:34.460]  It's just I don't know.
[45:34.520 --> 45:37.300]  I don't know anyone who like sleeps in these.
[45:37.480 --> 45:40.820]  So I just thought maybe after like the third time it happens in the movie,
[45:40.820 --> 45:45.180]  I was just going, dude, rich people pajamas must be like so nice.
[45:45.180 --> 45:48.280]  Like they just must be so comfortable sleeping in a shirt.
[45:48.840 --> 45:51.440]  I think every single time I've ever fallen asleep in a shirt,
[45:51.480 --> 45:53.640]  like whether it's one of those pajama shirts or just a T-shirt,
[45:53.900 --> 45:55.240]  I think it's been on accident.
[45:55.240 --> 46:00.080]  And I've woken up an hour to two hours in sweaty and like ripping it off.
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.320]  Like I only sleep in a shirt if I'm already sick or it makes me sick.
[46:04.680 --> 46:05.540]  Yeah, that's it.
[46:05.800 --> 46:08.680]  I'm at the point where I need to be able to adjust my temperature
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.000]  based entirely on the covers, because if I have to shirt take off,
[46:12.080 --> 46:15.200]  I've got to get it all around the hose and all around the head.
[46:15.260 --> 46:16.220]  Yeah, it's a whole thing.
[46:16.880 --> 46:18.180]  I didn't even think about this.
[46:18.420 --> 46:22.020]  Yeah, I'm like, I thought maybe you were calling your dick a hose.
[46:22.400 --> 46:26.780]  Yeah, yeah, you gotta get it around the hoses.
[46:26.880 --> 46:28.000]  I didn't even think about that.
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.520]  That's oh, man, I have to change my philosophy on shirts and bed.
[46:32.900 --> 46:35.060]  If I did do shirts, the neck would have to be wide enough
[46:35.060 --> 46:37.460]  for me to get all the way through so I could go downwards.
[46:38.300 --> 46:38.700]  Interesting.
[46:39.200 --> 46:42.320]  I would view a shirt and bed is like an emergency deploy pillow.
[46:43.080 --> 46:44.580]  Essentially how I would use it.
[46:44.820 --> 46:45.060]  A pillow?
[46:45.660 --> 46:48.540]  Yeah, because sometimes, you know, like as the bed goes from the wall
[46:48.540 --> 46:52.580]  and all the pillows get shot down to the floor, if I needed a pillow,
[46:52.980 --> 46:56.840]  I would just pop my shirt off and bundle that and then I could use that.
[46:56.840 --> 46:59.920]  And you're an animal because there's 17 pillows.
[47:00.140 --> 47:01.360]  You already have eight.
[47:01.520 --> 47:02.240]  You need a ninth.
[47:02.560 --> 47:03.760]  But they're all below me.
[47:03.900 --> 47:05.160]  I'm on top of all of them.
[47:05.460 --> 47:09.100]  Andrew, I sent you a tick tock that could solve your problems.
[47:09.200 --> 47:09.900]  Did you see it?
[47:10.100 --> 47:11.180]  No. Yeah, it doesn't work.
[47:11.240 --> 47:13.000]  That wouldn't work because the bed would keep moving.
[47:13.360 --> 47:14.020]  Can you explain it?
[47:14.320 --> 47:17.260]  It's a pillow that covers a hole in the back.
[47:17.580 --> 47:21.880]  Yeah, it's like a like a like a foam guard that is meant to sit in the space
[47:21.880 --> 47:25.740]  between your wall and your bed to stop literally to stop pillows from falling down.
[47:25.740 --> 47:28.160]  Oh, you like strap it to the bed somehow.
[47:28.380 --> 47:30.480]  So just like it's kind of like the thing that you buy
[47:30.480 --> 47:33.720]  that like goes between your seat and your dashboard and your car
[47:33.720 --> 47:36.340]  to stop your keys or shit from falling out of your pocket and going to your seat.
[47:36.420 --> 47:37.960]  It's kind of like that. Why wouldn't it work?
[47:38.140 --> 47:39.380]  I really appreciated it.
[47:39.460 --> 47:44.240]  Wouldn't work for me because the the bed moves until it can.
[47:45.120 --> 47:46.760]  And it's bigger than that.
[47:47.540 --> 47:49.800]  Yeah, but wouldn't it stop any if the bed moves
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.380]  because of the pillows that go down there?
[47:51.740 --> 47:52.640]  Oh, you think that's why?
[47:53.060 --> 47:54.420]  Yeah, they're creating a wedge system.
[47:54.940 --> 47:55.860]  Yeah, I think so.
[47:56.180 --> 48:00.460]  Maybe pushing the pillows down is pushing the bed away from the wall.
[48:00.500 --> 48:02.240]  Yeah, I think it might be one shot.
[48:02.660 --> 48:06.400]  Like you're you're crushing the pillows down the back of the bed, right?
[48:06.420 --> 48:07.900]  You're like lying slumped on them.
[48:08.220 --> 48:09.780]  Yeah, maybe I'll get this.
[48:09.840 --> 48:11.660]  I just I don't know. I've I've seen it.
[48:11.680 --> 48:13.960]  I didn't trust it just because of how far the bed goes.
[48:14.220 --> 48:14.940]  Maybe I'll get this.
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.860]  The solution to this is in your house.
[48:16.940 --> 48:17.800]  It's downstairs.
[48:18.580 --> 48:19.980]  It's true. You do have a headboard.
[48:20.320 --> 48:22.540]  It's a lot of it's a lot of steps.
[48:22.540 --> 48:24.280]  Take it up one step a day.
[48:24.280 --> 48:27.040]  Why not just put the mattress and shit down by that?
[48:27.180 --> 48:28.120]  Just that's what you sleep.
[48:28.320 --> 48:29.680]  No, no, it's not the steps.
[48:29.760 --> 48:30.940]  It's I just I need to
[48:31.900 --> 48:35.480]  I need to get rid of the the bed frame that is currently on
[48:35.480 --> 48:37.800]  and adjust that and then set that up.
[48:38.320 --> 48:43.200]  Well, a short term solution might just be the thing I found on TikTok shop.
[48:43.660 --> 48:46.320]  No, I think it's buying these expensive rich people pajamas
[48:46.320 --> 48:47.360]  and making them into pillows.
[48:47.620 --> 48:50.840]  I'm not a pajamas guy because I don't want to wear a work uniform to sleep.
[48:50.840 --> 48:53.680]  That's exactly what it looks like.
[48:53.820 --> 48:55.500]  It looks like he works at Bed, Bath and Beyond.
[48:55.820 --> 48:57.340]  And this is what he has to wear.
[48:57.460 --> 48:58.920]  And then he goes home and he sleeps in it.
[48:59.140 --> 49:01.920]  That would be funny to sell a set of sleep uniforms.
[49:02.380 --> 49:03.400]  That's what pajamas are.
[49:03.760 --> 49:04.920]  So I don't wear them.
[49:05.120 --> 49:06.960]  Yeah, but if they actually looked like other jobs.
[49:07.480 --> 49:08.520]  Yeah, like firemen.
[49:09.180 --> 49:13.700]  We do like we do like khaki, like pajama khaki pants and red shirt.
[49:13.780 --> 49:14.820]  So it looks like you work at Target.
[49:15.640 --> 49:17.700]  Gavin just invented underoos.
[49:17.700 --> 49:18.580]  Oh shit.
[49:20.060 --> 49:21.020]  It can be all kinds of stuff.
[49:21.100 --> 49:21.800]  You can be Captain America.
[49:21.960 --> 49:22.940]  Maybe you can be Iron Man.
[49:24.140 --> 49:25.680]  You can be Dr. Doom if you're feeling evil.
[49:27.280 --> 49:28.480]  Have you ever...
[49:28.480 --> 49:33.500]  I had a funny thing happen the other night where I watched the movie Timeline.
[49:33.840 --> 49:34.580]  That is funny.
[49:34.620 --> 49:35.400]  Have you ever seen Timeline?
[49:36.740 --> 49:37.800]  The story's not done.
[49:38.320 --> 49:41.780]  It's the Paul Walker movie with Billy Connolly.
[49:42.240 --> 49:43.620]  Oh, Jard Baller.
[49:44.080 --> 49:45.460]  It's a Michael Crichton.
[49:45.560 --> 49:46.520]  It's a Michael Crichton book.
[49:46.880 --> 49:47.300]  It is?
[49:47.300 --> 49:48.040]  Oh, I didn't.
[49:48.100 --> 49:49.600]  It's a Michael Crichton book.
[49:49.700 --> 49:50.460]  Yeah. What's it about?
[49:50.900 --> 49:53.060]  They go to like medieval Europe or some shit.
[49:53.340 --> 49:54.720]  Yeah, they're like archaeologists.
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.500]  And there's a way for them to go back to medieval Europe.
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.600]  And so they go back because one of the character's dads
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.300]  gets stuck back in time, played by Billy Connolly.
[50:04.380 --> 50:07.160]  But I watched it because I remember seeing it in theaters as a kid,
[50:07.260 --> 50:10.180]  forgetting it existed and then going, oh, fuck Timeline.
[50:10.380 --> 50:12.160]  What a weird movie that was.
[50:12.740 --> 50:13.300]  That is funny.
[50:13.960 --> 50:15.460]  So I, well, you know what?
[50:15.460 --> 50:15.800]  I'm done.
[50:15.800 --> 50:20.460]  I mean, you know, I think, I think, you know what?
[50:20.620 --> 50:22.760]  I don't think it'll get funnier than that.
[50:22.820 --> 50:24.360]  So I think we can call it there.
[50:25.020 --> 50:27.080]  That was a real hee-haw.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.820]  A real hee-haw.
[50:33.940 --> 50:35.360]  Yeah, that was a you know what?
[50:35.380 --> 50:37.620]  I got my jokes off. I got my laughs.
[50:37.760 --> 50:39.100]  I'm feeling pretty good about it.
[50:39.240 --> 50:39.800]  We can move on.
[50:39.800 --> 50:40.500]  I'm sorry.
[50:40.960 --> 50:41.960]  I did. I don't want to.
[50:42.120 --> 50:45.860]  I don't want to shove your story down behind the bed
[50:45.860 --> 50:47.600]  into the ground below the pillows.
[50:47.600 --> 50:48.520]  Please continue.
[50:48.760 --> 50:49.580]  No, no, I'm good.
[50:49.840 --> 50:51.180]  I'm good. I got the pillow.
[50:51.380 --> 50:56.300]  I set up the story catcher and it's, you know, it's we're good.
[50:56.740 --> 50:57.580]  Real funny.
[50:58.040 --> 51:00.420]  That was a good tale by me.
[51:01.640 --> 51:04.640]  This actually coincides with my final Meg note.
[51:04.840 --> 51:07.220]  Put this in the highlight reel of the show.
[51:07.960 --> 51:09.500]  What is your final Meg note?
[51:09.980 --> 51:11.160]  Geoff is the real villain.
[51:13.260 --> 51:14.580]  Wow! Wow!
[51:16.720 --> 51:18.400]  Wow! Holy shit.
[51:19.100 --> 51:20.780]  What what made her? Wow.
[51:20.980 --> 51:21.860]  What made her say that?
[51:21.900 --> 51:23.300]  That is great. That's groundbreaking.
[51:23.680 --> 51:25.120]  That's so crazy. Wow.
[51:25.520 --> 51:29.520]  No, it was based on when when he was putting the batter bottle
[51:30.160 --> 51:31.760]  and huffing it, Geoff was.
[51:31.980 --> 51:34.160]  Those those are two of the most British words, by the way.
[51:34.220 --> 51:35.220]  We just put those on the list.
[51:35.400 --> 51:37.080]  Yeah, right. And right now.
[51:37.080 --> 51:38.300]  What was the other one? Bottle and what?
[51:38.740 --> 51:40.240]  Batter bottle. Batter bottle.
[51:40.500 --> 51:41.140]  Oh, yeah. Batter bottle.
[51:42.580 --> 51:43.780]  It was batter and a water bottle.
[51:43.780 --> 51:48.180]  And, uh, Geoff was just intensely focused on Andrew
[51:48.180 --> 51:50.160]  actually tasting the Ming and old batter.
[51:53.660 --> 51:54.980]  Like, didn't just say it once.
[51:55.100 --> 51:57.880]  You must have asked him like eight times to taste it.
[51:59.700 --> 52:02.140]  Well, you know, what are you going to do?
[52:04.420 --> 52:06.660]  I think villain is a is an interesting word.
[52:06.760 --> 52:07.960]  It's not a word I would choose.
[52:08.340 --> 52:11.600]  But, you know, I'm excited for the next time we all got to dinner there
[52:11.600 --> 52:13.420]  because I'm sure she can elaborate on it.
[52:13.780 --> 52:15.380]  Oh, anybody.
[52:15.760 --> 52:17.600]  Anybody got any other stories about?
[52:18.020 --> 52:19.720]  I don't know. Paul Walker.
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.340]  No. Billy Connolly.
[52:24.040 --> 52:25.000]  Oh, 2000s.
[52:25.080 --> 52:27.580]  Wells run dry on archaeology stories.
[52:27.920 --> 52:30.740]  Was it like they touched a bone or something and got sent back in time?
[52:30.860 --> 52:32.760]  Like, why? Why were they in time?
[52:33.220 --> 52:35.980]  They hang on. What do you think happened?
[52:37.160 --> 52:37.980]  They're archaeologists.
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.400]  I assume they found some sort of medieval weapon or something,
[52:41.440 --> 52:43.000]  and they got back to it.
[52:43.460 --> 52:46.000]  You're thinking of the Black Knight starring Martin Lawrence.
[52:46.180 --> 52:47.360]  Where is that? What happens?
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.800]  Yeah. You see, it's like a medallion in a mini golf course
[52:50.800 --> 52:55.340]  and he goes to reach for it and he ends up time traveling back to medieval times.
[52:55.900 --> 52:58.040]  Oh, wow. That sounds like a fun movie.
[52:58.080 --> 52:58.640]  I should watch that.
[52:59.020 --> 53:01.160]  I don't know if the Black Knight holds up.
[53:01.480 --> 53:03.720]  I can't imagine it does, but
[53:05.120 --> 53:07.540]  what do you think is better, the Black Knight or timeline?
[53:08.260 --> 53:09.420]  Oh, probably. Oh, boy.
[53:09.720 --> 53:12.040]  Probably Black Knight, because I think I remember reading.
[53:12.040 --> 53:15.700]  I remember reading timeline in eighth grade and being so confused
[53:15.700 --> 53:16.620]  by what I was reading.
[53:16.760 --> 53:18.900]  I'm like, I don't follow any of what's happening here.
[53:18.980 --> 53:19.740]  I don't think I've seen.
[53:20.020 --> 53:21.100]  I don't think the movie.
[53:21.420 --> 53:23.040]  Yeah, I don't think like the movie was any good.
[53:23.180 --> 53:26.380]  I, Geoff, I cannot imagine Black Knight was in your wheelhouse to begin with.
[53:26.760 --> 53:29.700]  I mean, I remember when it came out and all, but yeah, I wasn't.
[53:29.760 --> 53:30.640]  I didn't watch it.
[53:30.760 --> 53:32.940]  What was the one with Jean Reno where he was a knight
[53:32.940 --> 53:35.480]  that got brought to modern times, the reverse of that?
[53:36.060 --> 53:37.140]  I don't think I saw that either.
[53:37.580 --> 53:38.960]  White Knight? French Knight?
[53:40.480 --> 53:44.080]  There's one where it's like Jean Reno and somebody gets sent back.
[53:44.340 --> 53:49.760]  Just Visiting is an American retelling of the 1993 French comedy
[53:49.760 --> 53:52.900]  blockbuster, La Visiteurs, in which
[53:53.740 --> 53:55.860]  in which stars Jean Reno.
[53:56.220 --> 53:57.460]  OK, there you go.
[53:57.700 --> 53:58.860]  There's two scenes in it.
[53:58.900 --> 54:02.360]  I remember one where they eat urinal cakes because they just don't understand.
[54:02.880 --> 54:06.560]  And then another one where they see a minivan and they think it's a dragon
[54:06.560 --> 54:08.620]  and they just beat the shit out of it with swords.
[54:08.620 --> 54:10.700]  Why would you eat a urinal?
[54:10.700 --> 54:12.540]  Why would you think a urinal cake is food?
[54:13.360 --> 54:13.840]  I don't know.
[54:13.840 --> 54:16.840]  I mean, I've seen I've seen people wash their hands in those piss troughs.
[54:17.240 --> 54:19.840]  Yeah. They think the urinal cake is a soap.
[54:20.260 --> 54:22.180]  That's another one. Put that put that on the list.
[54:22.480 --> 54:23.380]  Yeah. But yeah, yeah.
[54:23.380 --> 54:24.660]  Thank you. Urinal. Yeah.
[54:25.120 --> 54:29.220]  Should we have a back to back like a dual screening of Black Knight and French Knight?
[54:29.400 --> 54:31.900]  Yeah. Black Knight and French Knight?
[54:32.440 --> 54:33.420]  No, that would be fun.
[54:33.940 --> 54:36.700]  I've we have so much TV show to watch, dude.
[54:36.760 --> 54:37.780]  I don't want to watch.
[54:37.780 --> 54:42.140]  Oh, yeah. We have to wait for your ass to come back from your trip
[54:42.140 --> 54:43.220]  so we can watch this shit.
[54:43.760 --> 54:44.120]  Goddamn.
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.020]  Do you know when you watch a movie that you haven't seen in so long?
[54:49.100 --> 54:50.600]  Like, have you watched a movie recently where it's like,
[54:50.620 --> 54:53.060]  Oh, it must have been like 25 years since I've seen that.
[54:53.640 --> 54:57.200]  I've already picked the show or the movie I want to watch.
[54:57.260 --> 55:00.320]  That will be the furthest distance from when I last watched it.
[55:00.580 --> 55:01.700]  Oh, what is it?
[55:01.960 --> 55:05.440]  I'm going to watch it, hopefully in my 70s, and I'm going to watch
[55:06.540 --> 55:08.780]  I'm going to watch Blue Streak.
[55:10.340 --> 55:11.920]  The Martin Lawrence classic.
[55:12.160 --> 55:16.360]  Because I remember Red Tear from Blockbuster when I was sick
[55:17.030 --> 55:20.900]  and I was coming a day off from school and I must have been 10.
[55:21.400 --> 55:25.640]  But I think a nice 60 year gap between viewings will be an exciting one.
[55:25.940 --> 55:26.780]  They're making a sequel.
[55:27.300 --> 55:27.920]  Oh, shit.
[55:28.940 --> 55:31.080]  They are? They're making a sequel?
[55:32.140 --> 55:33.700]  How did Nick know that?
[55:33.700 --> 55:36.880]  Hey, hey, as Gus told us, if Luke Wilson's in it, I'm there.
[55:37.100 --> 55:40.340]  That's true. Gus, a huge Luke Wilson fan.
[55:41.220 --> 55:42.980]  Well, what's the film that you've watched as a child
[55:42.980 --> 55:44.980]  that you think would be fun to watch again, but much later?
[55:46.100 --> 55:50.120]  Porky's. No, I don't know if that's going to be a fun one.
[55:50.260 --> 55:50.960]  I don't know.
[55:54.720 --> 55:56.880]  Oh, uh, Maverick.
[55:57.400 --> 55:59.200]  Oh, yeah. The Mel Gibson.
[55:59.640 --> 56:02.600]  Yeah. The Mel Gibson, like gambling one or whatever.
[56:02.600 --> 56:04.320]  Look at your cards, Maverick.
[56:04.660 --> 56:06.620]  Look at your cards. And he won't do it.
[56:06.660 --> 56:07.460]  He won't look at his cards.
[56:07.780 --> 56:08.720]  You know what I'd like to see?
[56:08.940 --> 56:13.660]  I one of my favorite movies when I was a little kid was Six Pack with Kenny Rogers.
[56:13.920 --> 56:16.100]  And I haven't seen it since I was a little kid.
[56:16.380 --> 56:18.740]  What is that? He's like a stock car racer.
[56:18.740 --> 56:22.920]  And he stumbles upon this group of kids that don't have parents.
[56:23.060 --> 56:26.480]  And he ends up like taking him in and they help him as a stock car racer.
[56:26.600 --> 56:27.680]  It's like six kids.
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.820]  And it's like a fan. Yeah, there you go.
[56:29.840 --> 56:30.480]  It's like a comedy.
[56:30.480 --> 56:32.680]  How old is Diane Lane?
[56:33.040 --> 56:34.220]  That's like seven or eight.
[56:34.320 --> 56:37.800]  When I saw this, I'd love to see it again, but maybe I'll watch it when I'm 100.
[56:38.120 --> 56:42.200]  Is Diane Lane is in this and she's like, how this is crazy.
[56:42.600 --> 56:44.700]  Yeah. And Aaron Gray is in it.
[56:44.720 --> 56:47.000]  She's the lady. Diane Lane was a child actor.
[56:47.560 --> 56:48.760]  Well, I guess so. What?
[56:48.940 --> 56:50.040]  She was in Six Pack.
[56:50.380 --> 56:51.040]  That's crazy.
[56:51.240 --> 56:53.080]  It's I remember being a great fucking movie.
[56:53.560 --> 56:55.160]  But, you know, I was like maybe eight.
[56:55.500 --> 56:56.440]  So, wow.
[56:56.880 --> 56:59.080]  I like that they're making toys out of all the car parts.
[56:59.940 --> 57:00.860]  They're having fun.
[57:00.900 --> 57:04.060]  And they are not currently making a sequel to it, I don't think.
[57:04.400 --> 57:05.620]  Yeah. Who knows?
[57:06.700 --> 57:08.580]  Oh, Robin Hood Men in Tights.
[57:09.220 --> 57:10.420]  Would that be fun?
[57:10.780 --> 57:12.200]  Yeah, I saw that like a year ago.
[57:12.740 --> 57:14.400]  Oh, did you? Did it hold up?
[57:14.540 --> 57:15.320]  Not for the first time.
[57:15.680 --> 57:16.900]  I mean, I liked it.
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.360]  Yeah. I haven't seen it in a long time.
[57:19.620 --> 57:20.560]  What about Hot Shots?
[57:21.160 --> 57:23.440]  Oh, I haven't seen that since I was probably 12.
[57:23.780 --> 57:25.900]  I've never actually seen Hot Shots.
[57:26.100 --> 57:27.120]  I've only seen the second one.
[57:27.120 --> 57:28.880]  Yeah. What about Hot Shots Part Deux?
[57:29.300 --> 57:30.320]  No, I didn't see that either.
[57:30.840 --> 57:31.000]  Man.
[57:32.540 --> 57:33.760]  Well, I'm out of ideas.
[57:34.260 --> 57:40.260]  I remember thinking that movies spoofing other movies were not my thing.
[57:40.640 --> 57:41.220]  Oh, wow.
[57:41.720 --> 57:43.240]  Yeah. Like Scary Movie and all that.
[57:43.280 --> 57:44.180]  I never saw any of that shit.
[57:44.340 --> 57:46.240]  I never like I don't know why.
[57:46.380 --> 57:47.400]  I just it never appealed to me.
[57:47.740 --> 57:50.500]  Yeah, but like Naked Gun and Airplane and stuff are great.
[57:50.580 --> 57:51.160]  That's different.
[57:51.660 --> 57:51.900]  Unstoppable.
[57:52.480 --> 57:53.540]  That Naked Gun is different.
[57:53.640 --> 57:54.560]  That's a different genre.
[57:54.920 --> 57:55.580]  Yeah, those are funny.
[57:56.140 --> 57:57.520]  That's that's spoofing.
[57:57.660 --> 57:58.020]  Jeez.
[57:58.560 --> 57:59.540]  Cop stuff, though.
[57:59.960 --> 58:00.500]  I guess.
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.380]  I mean, Airplane is a direct parody of I forget the name.
[58:04.700 --> 58:05.200]  That's true.
[58:05.320 --> 58:10.760]  I guess I guess I just it's weird for me to compare Airplane to Scary Movie
[58:10.760 --> 58:13.140]  or not another teen movie or one of the.
[58:13.260 --> 58:13.720]  Are they not?
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.320]  Are they not by like the same people?
[58:15.640 --> 58:17.120]  No, not the scary.
[58:17.360 --> 58:18.660]  The Zuckers did.
[58:18.800 --> 58:22.020]  I thought that I thought the Zucker Brothers had something to do with Scary Movie.
[58:22.120 --> 58:25.260]  No, it's the Wayans were the Scary Movie people.
[58:25.740 --> 58:26.540]  Huh? Yeah.
[58:26.960 --> 58:29.800]  Scary Movie 4 director David Zucker.
[58:30.300 --> 58:31.020]  Oh, wow.
[58:31.860 --> 58:33.020]  That's I didn't think.
[58:33.220 --> 58:35.000]  Listen, I didn't think I was wrong.
[58:35.400 --> 58:40.420]  I will say I went back and Emily showed me Scary Movie most of the time.
[58:40.860 --> 58:42.600]  Whichever Scary Movie has Chris Elliott in it.
[58:42.680 --> 58:43.400]  She showed me that one.
[58:43.560 --> 58:46.720]  And I said, OK, and I laughed through the whole thing.
[58:46.840 --> 58:47.500]  And I thought it was funny.
[58:47.620 --> 58:48.300]  Oh, with his hand?
[58:48.760 --> 58:50.540]  Two years ago with his strong hand and stuff.
[58:50.600 --> 58:51.820]  Yeah, it was all very funny.
[58:51.920 --> 58:53.940]  And so I was like, man, I can't believe I waited.
[58:53.940 --> 58:55.020]  I had never watched this.
[58:55.360 --> 58:59.020]  So, Eric, can I when we're done with it,
[58:59.100 --> 59:04.660]  can I make a compilation from Pico Park of all the times that you're wrong?
[59:05.100 --> 59:05.900]  Yeah, no, that's fine.
[59:05.980 --> 59:09.560]  I think I think it would be really good to have a YouTube short on our channel.
[59:09.740 --> 59:10.880]  So I think that's probably. Yeah.
[59:10.920 --> 59:12.380]  I don't think it would fit within a short.
[59:12.380 --> 59:14.440]  I can't imagine it would be more than 60 seconds.
[59:14.640 --> 59:16.740]  So, yeah, I don't really don't have an issue with that.
[59:17.080 --> 59:17.740]  Go for it. Mm.
[59:18.200 --> 59:18.960]  Any other thoughts?
[59:19.100 --> 59:20.560]  We wouldn't have to tail sink for that.
[59:25.600 --> 59:30.540]  Oh, also, the audience told me that that game that I tried to get everyone
[59:30.540 --> 59:34.300]  to play in GTA four recently with the like, yeah, yeah, it was cool.
[59:34.340 --> 59:35.800]  It was bike bat. We should have bike bat.
[59:36.580 --> 59:38.260]  What do you mean it was bike? What does that mean?
[59:38.420 --> 59:40.340]  It was the wrong game type.
[59:40.700 --> 59:42.880]  You god damn it.
[59:43.860 --> 59:45.200]  Fuck. It was still fun.
[59:45.620 --> 59:47.440]  It had bike in the name. I was half right.
[59:47.720 --> 59:49.780]  I feel like I even said something about in the moment.
[59:49.840 --> 59:52.060]  Like, I thought this was different. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[59:52.080 --> 59:53.360]  I immediately knew it was different.
[59:53.360 --> 59:55.560]  But I thought maybe we get the bikes at some point.
[59:58.200 --> 59:59.820]  Maybe next time we can play on PC.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.900]  Oh, my God. Hey, with Geoff out of town, are we like going crazy on heist
[01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.460]  or what are we doing?
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.440]  I know by the time this is out, we've already figured it out or whatever.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.240]  I'm sure we'll film some more.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.020]  OK. How many videos, how many heist videos are there now?
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.760]  Like, what are we up to?
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:18.000]  Do you know, Nick, offhand?
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:19.360]  Eleven have come out.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:21.760]  Is that right? Right. But how many are we recorded?
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.580]  We did 12, which was the original run.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.680]  And then I think we're through seven or eight doomsday.
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.440]  OK, so like 20. Yeah, right around there.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.200]  Plus the mini heist.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.640]  We'll have to get through those.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.940]  And then unfortunately, Geoff, we're going to have to play a lot of repo
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.940]  without you. I'm very sorry.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.560]  That's fine. I understand.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.380]  I would never want to hold you guys back.
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.140]  No, we'll all die and then Andrew can beat the level by himself
[01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.540]  and it'll be really good. It'll be a lot of fun.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.400]  Unfortunately, I'll be coming back from vacation right about the time
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.660]  you guys are sick of playing repo.
[01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.100]  I'll just miss it.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.920]  They'll be thinking about it for two and a half weeks.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:59.240]  And I feel like I am uniquely suited to that because that happened to me
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.340]  so many times throughout my history of Achievement Hunter that I'm just used to it.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.980]  What we need to do shortly after you come back, Geoff,
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:10.220]  is record the summer movie battle for this upcoming season.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.960]  Oh, I put together the list of movies and it is a strong list.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.560]  Is it really? It's there's a lot.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.260]  Did we ever announce who won the kicker picker?
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.760]  I don't think so. I have no idea.
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.020]  I think so. I saw a comment about it recently and I don't think we ever said.
[01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.660]  But can we just say Eric won?
[01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.240]  Yeah, I just assumed it was me.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.880]  I think it was Eric, right?
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.180]  All right. Well, there you go, Eric won.
[01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.180]  Cool. Hey, Eric, congratulations.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.280]  Thank you guys so much.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.420]  Hey, honestly, I really appreciate it.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.960]  Everyone kind of showed up, showed out.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.540]  Everyone kind of went out there, did their thing.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.480]  It's it's not it's not a solo venture.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.540]  You know, it's a team sport.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.900]  Everyone's got their role to play.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.720]  Everyone's out there kicking for points and, you know, may the best man win.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.520]  And this time it was me. So thank you very much.
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.380]  There you go.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.400]  There's a movie in the summer movie battle that is untitled
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:06.420]  and is just actor director combo set for the state.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.000]  Can't wait for Geoff to buy it.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:10.300]  Oh, is it Kevin Costner? It's a.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.020]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.920]  Do you think that's going to be on this list?
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.720]  It's not. It's not currently scheduled for this summer.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.620]  What? Horizon Part Two? Horizon Part Two.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:22.700]  Yeah, I don't know if it's dated.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.880]  You do. You do technically own it.
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.240]  So it would it would carry over.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.020]  Yeah, I think I should just get it still.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.580]  I've already I've already got that one.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:30.480]  I should start with that.
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.520]  Oh, well, am I buying it again?
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:37.240]  If anybody's movies from last year show up in the theater again this year,
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:38.400]  do they get do we count?
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.900]  No. Like if there's like a summer run of last year's.
[01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.580]  No, I don't know. Deadpool.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.280]  Is it adding to the box office?
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.000]  You do own the movie.
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:46.920]  I think so.
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.320]  But it's for a different season.
[01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.740]  If you draft the player and then they leave your team and play for someone else.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.000]  It's not like, oh, I drafted them.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.460]  Yeah, but it's not a different.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.140]  It's not the same actor in a different movie.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.740]  But it's a statistical.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.840]  You what we're playing for is season by season.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.540]  You did not draft them in the next season.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:05.940]  You already own it.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.140]  For the season in which the game takes place.
[01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.840]  Right. This is no longer that season.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.440]  We're restarting everything.
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.200]  Does it add to the box office total, though?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.300]  Yeah, but for four.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.120]  But we're not totaling that anymore.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.420]  So what's the director actor then?
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:23.620]  Of what?
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.640]  My God, we are.
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.540]  I don't know for fried or what, but that was Ryan Reynolds
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.660]  and the night at the museum.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.080]  You. What?
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.600]  For Deadpool 3 or whatever Wolverine.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.080]  You said that there's a movie you were excited for me to pick.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.000]  Oh, sorry.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.520]  Yeah, I was really caught up.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.320]  It's it's Trey Parker, Matt Stone.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.740]  I'll get it. Kendrick Lamar.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.860]  I'll get it. I'm good. I'll take it.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.340]  July 4th slated because last time it was David Chase a horror thing.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.200]  I don't remember who else was part of that.
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:01.340]  Why did you say Ryan Reynolds in night at the museum guy?
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.860]  He was thinking director and actor of Wolverine.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.400]  He said he was the director and actor.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.740]  The last thing we talked about was Deadpool Wolverine.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:14.000]  Oh, so it's Ryan Reynolds and then the night at the museum.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.380]  You guy. I don't know his name.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:23.180]  But but we're agreed that if Horizon Part two is out there, it's mine, right?
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:26.220]  No, I mean, yeah, I think I paid for it.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.560]  I it's not it's not like I generate any revenue for it last time.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.540]  Well, too bad. Not this time either.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.120]  Too bad, my ass. What do you mean?
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.860]  Do we get to carry over money from last?
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.720]  I think I'm totally I think I totally agree with Gavin here.
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.600]  You if you're playing fantasy football
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.700]  and you pick a player and you redraft the next year,
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.140]  you don't get the points for the players you redrafted
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.480]  or you took the previous year.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.780]  It's a movie, though. It's not a sport.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.540]  No, it's a movie. It's a fantasy game.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.900]  You did say it was a movie that our studio owned and produced.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:59.580]  Yeah. And we were tracking for one season and then we're restarting
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.540]  and we're losing everything.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.620]  I don't think we had.
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.820]  Did we have studios for that or was that just for our DVD box sets?
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:06.600]  We did the DVD boxes of studios.
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.100]  We didn't have studios. Yeah, we did.
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:10.140]  I mean, I did in my head, but OK.
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.660]  I vote no. You vote no?
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.540]  It's a definite no. Nick, let's hear your reason for no.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.860]  I don't want it.
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.520]  OK, that's pretty definite.
[01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.720]  Nick is a logical, reasonable man.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.980]  Yeah, I wouldn't say that. You paid for it last year, it didn't come out in time.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.080]  That's on you. I'm sorry.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.200]  So here we are.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.740]  It seems like Nick and Andrew are both hard nosed.
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.640]  Gavin and Geoff are both yeses.
[01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:35.180]  Very interesting. Very interesting.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:39.020]  And let's let's keep in mind that I had, you know, a disadvantage last year
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.060]  because of it.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.420]  Because you played poorly.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:46.300]  Now, what was yeah, what was the disadvantage that you definitely picked?
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.680]  You made a shitty pick, dude.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.920]  I don't know if that's a disadvantage.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.820]  I think Geoff just changed his vote.
[01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.660]  Don't start pushing me on their side, Gavin.
[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.020]  Yeah, you know, one of my movies coming out wasn't a disadvantage.
[01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.060]  I mean, I had a movie that didn't come out, too.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.780]  I had the fucking... It was, but everyone's at risk for it.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.500]  I had the same problem with the David Chase thing.
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.040]  By the way, if my David is that untitled David Chase movie comes out this year,
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.980]  I want it. You absolutely should get it.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.080]  Yeah, you know, you can pay the points for it and get it again.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.420]  Yeah, well, I guess it depends on what Eric says right here.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.480]  Yeah, but if I buy it, if I'm a studio and I buy a script.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.660]  No we're not. We're playing a game.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.660]  We're playing a game.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.320]  Andrew's going to get pissed.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.720]  If you draft the player and they blow their knee out, that sucks.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.680]  You just take a hit. This is how it goes.
[01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:27.380]  That's true. Believe me, I lost a lot of kickers last year.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.460]  And it's true.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.420]  What if we just poll the audience?
[01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:33.300]  No. What do we care about polling the audience?
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.100]  What are you crazy?
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.460]  We're not pulling the audience for this.
[01:06:35.460 --> 01:06:37.940]  Why not? Because it's our game.
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:41.680]  Yeah, it's a game I want to play with.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.580]  And they have a view.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.100]  Tremendous input on when everyone disagrees with me.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.200]  Look, we it's the company is split down the middle.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.240]  Yeah, it has audience confidence after this worm thing.
[01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.720]  No, I mean, I've I've lost in this episode or the last one, but
[01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.860]  I think it's a fair I think it should be a fair vote.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:05.140]  I don't know. I think we I think we got to see what how Eric votes.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.700]  OK, I think it's I think it's interesting because this does this apply to every
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:13.180]  I mean, there are what, 40, 41 movies that were draftable last year.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:17.660]  And you're saying that if Maxine or A Quiet Place
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.820]  day one or like Furiosa or whatever
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:25.380]  come back in a theater this year, like that's eligible
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.120]  because you drafted it before, that's what you're saying?
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.020]  Yeah, because sometimes a studio will hold a movie that's fully made, edited, finished.
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.980]  I think it's way funnier if Horizon part two comes out
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:39.920]  and somebody else gets to claim the money for it on the second.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.600]  That is very funny.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.980]  That is very funny. But I'm still I mean, I agree that that's funny.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.460]  But yeah, but what if it's now a shared studio product?
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:49.980]  What project that I get a 50 50 split?
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.200]  No, let's just stick to your guns.
[01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.460]  Galveston, stop trying to negotiate.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.340]  I'll tell you what, you can take it
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.800]  if you give away the amount of points that you spend on it.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:02.400]  I don't think it's going to matter because that's very funny, by the way.
[01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.520]  I think Eric, I think Eric's going to vote against us.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.360]  Gavin, I think that's the way the winds are blowing.
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.500]  One, two, three.
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.340]  Should we have to vote?
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:10.520]  How many points did he give away for it?
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.540]  I'm looking. One, two, three.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.640]  It appears to be six.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.520]  I don't know if that's right.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.540]  I'm looking. I'm checking right now.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.700]  It might be that he spent six points on that.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:24.880]  I will say the only way
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:31.320]  I think Horizon and American Saga Chapter two is the only eligible one.
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.120]  No other ones can be eligible.
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:36.620]  It's that it's either that one or it's nothing.
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:40.520]  OK, I was going to float a compromise of you get your movie back
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.080]  20 years after it releases, because that's also very funny to me.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.960]  If you have like a Titanic and it re-releases the theaters 20 years later
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.840]  and you're like, oh, shit, this is my year.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.620]  I got that Titanic bump again.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.920]  I like that, but I don't like when it's so close.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:00.480]  Yeah, I think Horizon part two is the only one that I would be OK with.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.140]  Sure. Gavin getting.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.180]  But I also think now, let me pose this.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.740]  I don't know if this is one step sort of past it.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.860]  Should it cost him six points?
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.500]  Yes. Why?
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.760]  It's just me buying it again.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.820]  What do you mean? OK.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.040]  I bought it. I own the damn thing.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.680]  No, no, no, no. You have to retain the rights.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.740]  Yeah, right. You have to maintain the rights.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:21.340]  You have to renew your rights.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.680]  Yes. You have to renew your rights.
[01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:24.660]  I think that that is totally fair.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.060]  And yeah, but you know what?
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.140]  You spent that's the six points you spent last season acquiring.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:31.800]  It also probably went into the marketing of it and everything.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:33.140]  They just those are just sunk costs.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.680]  You got to do that again this year if you're going to release the film.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.800]  It's going to cost you six points if you want it. That's all.
[01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.560]  It's going to cost me 100 percent again.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.800]  It should surely be a percentage.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:42.980]  No, you have to pay.
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.840]  You paid a licensing fee.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.220]  It is a percentage. One hundred is a percent.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.940]  I'm licensing it for myself.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:49.960]  No. What about this?
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:51.780]  All right. I'll pay me six points.
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.820]  No, no, no.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.000]  You either subtract six points or it goes into the pool and anybody can buy it.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.200]  Oh, my God. There's the market.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.740]  Funny. Now that's funny.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.420]  Now that that's auctioning off a monopoly property style.
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:10.200]  I like that a lot.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.860]  You you have the first right of refusal because you bought it previously.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.020]  But if you don't want it for the points that you previously paid,
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.100]  then it goes back into the market for anybody else to acquire.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:23.140]  I can get behind this, but I can still get involved in the auction.
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.820]  Yes. So I can potentially pick it up for. Yes, absolutely.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.400]  If you think it'll go less than.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.660]  But anybody, it's free market at that point.
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:34.300]  If you think after this conversation that that's
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:38.380]  that that's going for less than six, you're losing your fucking mind, buddy.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.580]  It's one of us is immediately just going to say for five
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.660]  and then it'll just be him trying to decide.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:49.640]  It just became just became revealed that one of us is the villain of the show.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.740]  Oh, that's a fun wrinkle.
[01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:56.540]  I like that a lot. Great idea, Gavin.
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.920]  Once again, great idea.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.280]  OK, so it can be back up.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.500]  You have right of first refusal and there you go. This is great. Stupid.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.840]  Right. It was a bad pick.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.720]  One of the chances that this fucking movie is coming out in twenty twenty five zero,
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:14.380]  but he wants to he wants to maybe buy it again, I guess.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.560]  So whatever. We'll see who's selling it.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.440]  That's a great universe.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.920]  It's me. I'm paying me.
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:23.040]  No, no, you're paying.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.300]  You're just kind of like paying God. You know what I mean?
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.900]  There's like zero point zero percent chance.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.580]  I will put it back into the pool for six points.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.400]  You'll put it back in the pool for six points.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.020]  Is that what you said?
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.140]  No. You want to get paid six points?
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.540]  Nobody else wants it.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.160]  I'll start with six extra points.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.860]  No. So in this world, Gavin, and this this make believe thing that we've set up,
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:49.680]  I saw this movie is owned by whoever made the film in real life.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:54.400]  And you've purchased a licensing right from them that expires after a season.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.960]  It's not their fault.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.080]  You didn't release the fucking movie last year.
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.240]  Yeah. Why didn't you release it?
[01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.300]  Yeah, you should have released it, man.
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:01.620]  Yeah, dude, come on.
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:04.720]  Yeah, but that would have been a clause that says if the movie doesn't come out,
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.880]  the license extends.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.300]  No, it's if it doesn't come out, there's no such clause.
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:11.680]  Can you point to that clause?
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.140]  I actually I have the fictional contract right here.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:17.340]  The clause says it says that if it doesn't,
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.660]  then you have first right of refusal for the same price the following year.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.580]  Yep. It's like it's like arguing with three annoying wolves.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.140]  Wait, four.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.260]  In a room that you constructed.
[01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:29.580]  You heard it. No, no, you heard it.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600]  He doesn't think I'm annoying.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.700]  I know I was I was not included in that.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.160]  Three annoying wolves and a wool.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.460]  Oh, man.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.920]  All right. We should we should wrap this up because I think we landed on exactly
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.200]  what we're doing, so I feel good about it.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.620]  Yeah, great idea.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:49.400]  Yeah, great idea, dude.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.780]  Why don't we actually adopt? What is it?
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:53.200]  You have first right of refusal.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.120]  Refusal. It costs you six points if you want it.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:57.360]  If not, it'll go back in the pool.
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.920]  So we'll just open with that.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.900]  Yeah, yeah, we yeah, we open with that one.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:01.560]  Open with that? Sure.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:02.640]  Huh.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.900]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.940]  I mean, I think it's a pretty good compromise.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.380]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.840]  For who? For everybody involved.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.200]  Yeah. You basically get access to your movie again
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.200]  if you want it and nobody can stop you.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.680]  Like that's lucky me.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:27.080]  I also get access to my chair and my desk.
[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.440]  All these things that I bought.
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:29.120]  Guess what, buddy?
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.720]  I'm sitting, listen, motherfucker, I am sitting on an untitled
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.360]  David Chase movie that is not included in this fucking deal.
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:38.040]  I think if it comes out, you should get it.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.400]  I spent my points on it just like you did.
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:45.700]  But I heard Eric say the only way I agree to this is if only fucking Gavin's movie
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:48.200]  is included and everybody agreed with that.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.660]  So I went along with the ride.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:50.500]  I'm like, yeah, OK.
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.840]  If that's how it is, that's how it is.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:53.340]  My movie didn't even have a fucking title.
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:54.560]  Maybe that's a prerequisite.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.260]  It has to have a name for it to be considered.
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.940]  It's cool. I'll eat the cost.
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:02.260]  And I, I acquiesce to that privately and internally
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:04.180]  because I realized it was what was for the best.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:06.120]  And I think that this is a compromise.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.840]  I feel we all compromised and it's great.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.120]  Good compromise, guys.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.300]  Good compromise, everybody.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.360]  I feel like some came out slightly better than others.
[01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:15.020]  But yeah, that was good negotiation.
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.740]  Yeah. Some people have access to movies.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:17.940]  Other people don't. That's pretty cool.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.060]  Yeah, nice work.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.040]  Four annoying moles.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.540]  Can we tailsync?
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.120]  We should.
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.280]  We definitely should.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.560]  Boy, this has been great.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:31.980]  Thank you so much.
[01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.420]  Appreciate everyone who listened.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.020]  Thanks for checking us out.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.680]  Thanks for watching Mario Party.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.460]  Thanks for sticking with us.
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.880]  Thanks for checking out Patreon.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:50.180]  Thanks for being with us for almost one full year.
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.880]  It's been great and it's only getting better.
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.540]  And that's from me, your kicker picker winner, Eric.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.820]  We'll see you guys next time.
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:14:58.840]  Check out the Patreon.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:14:59.640]  Bye.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:00.660]  Bye.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.800]  Love you guys.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:06.420]  Oh, and just in case I die on vacation, this is the last podcast I was ever in.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.400]  So I love you all.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:07.840]  Bye.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.360]  Bye.
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:09.840]  Oh, God. Bye.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.060]  Good morning guests tomorrow.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:12.440]  All right.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.740]  Second to last podcast I was ever in.
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:15.180]  Bye.
