[00:00.000 --> 00:05.820]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast, but not just another episode.
[00:05.980 --> 00:11.740]  This one's kind of special. Why? Because it's our 52nd episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:12.060 --> 00:18.040]  That means exactly one year ago, we ripped the Band-Aid off and started this whole thing
[00:18.040 --> 00:21.660]  over again. My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Frey, Nick
[00:21.660 --> 00:22.980]  Schwartz and Eric Baudour.
[00:23.180 --> 00:23.720]  I have a question.
[00:23.720 --> 00:30.140]  Well, shut up for a second. Happy... Hey, I'm trying to be nice to you. Happy anniversary,
[00:30.460 --> 00:33.500]  everybody. I love you all dearly. And that includes the audience.
[00:34.380 --> 00:35.260]  Happy anniversary?
[00:35.960 --> 00:37.940]  Well, I want to get to Gavin's question.
[00:39.080 --> 00:41.780]  I can't believe it's been a year. That flew. I was going to wonder if,
[00:41.860 --> 00:43.660]  is this the first episode of season two?
[00:44.740 --> 00:48.200]  No, wouldn't this be the last episode of season one?
[00:48.660 --> 00:48.880]  Oh.
[00:49.460 --> 00:50.400]  Well, when does this come out?
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.300]  The seventh.
[00:53.060 --> 00:54.200]  Okay. Yeah.
[00:54.840 --> 00:55.900]  So, season finale?
[00:56.400 --> 00:56.900]  It's pretty close.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.780]  Yeah, season finale. Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:00.060 --> 01:02.940]  We actually had a full-blown regular season,
[01:03.320 --> 01:06.580]  where I don't think we had any additional power cut episodes or anything.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.540]  You know, that's the difference between regulation and f***face right there.
[01:11.920 --> 01:13.880]  That we somehow did it for a year straight.
[01:14.400 --> 01:16.880]  Yeah, it's all very regulation above board.
[01:17.440 --> 01:20.360]  One to 52, no weird number schemes, no nothing.
[01:20.360 --> 01:24.440]  That's great that our first regulation season was a perfectly regulation season.
[01:24.740 --> 01:26.240]  It was. Yeah.
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.640]  And we couldn't have done it without all of our patrons and people that supported us.
[01:30.800 --> 01:32.640]  It's insane. It's insane to look back.
[01:32.760 --> 01:38.200]  Like, the uncertainty going into year one to, I mean, obviously still, it's always uncertain.
[01:38.680 --> 01:42.460]  But just knowing that we've been able to continue this for a year
[01:42.460 --> 01:46.480]  and are so excited for going into the future and doing things.
[01:46.920 --> 01:48.520]  I feel like we went into it with a lot of
[01:49.380 --> 01:51.700]  and absolutely came out with a lot of like, whew.
[01:52.540 --> 01:57.580]  I went into it with a lot of fear, diarrhea, and I'm coming out with it with a lot of well-adjusted,
[01:57.680 --> 02:00.200]  like, normal diarrhea, like factual diarrhea.
[02:00.800 --> 02:04.320]  Dude, Geoff, like, you're, oh man, I don't know.
[02:04.420 --> 02:07.480]  We spent a lot of time together with Geoff today and it was...
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.200]  Dude, dude, I gotta find a cup.
[02:12.320 --> 02:14.520]  I gotta find a cup. We need to get water in this bowl.
[02:14.860 --> 02:15.980]  What's the, what's the...
[02:15.980 --> 02:22.180]  So you wrecked a toilet so much that you wanted to fill up the system manually.
[02:22.360 --> 02:23.520]  Is that right? Is that what you were doing?
[02:24.720 --> 02:27.580]  Well, you're making it sound a lot more inelegant than it was.
[02:28.860 --> 02:31.620]  Basically, what happened was I had a evacuation.
[02:33.160 --> 02:35.740]  And for a while there, because we were all there together.
[02:36.400 --> 02:38.100]  And then I flushed that away just fine.
[02:38.700 --> 02:42.060]  And then about three minutes later, I realized that dislodged the real need.
[02:42.420 --> 02:43.720]  And so I went back in again.
[02:43.720 --> 02:49.600]  And that one, there just wasn't enough water left in the tank to get it all down.
[02:49.780 --> 02:53.040]  And you don't want to let it simmer. You know what I mean? That's not good.
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.100]  And so I was just waiting for the toilet to refill,
[02:57.200 --> 03:00.260]  but it just refills that like a glacially slow pace.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.380]  So I thought I got to help this along.
[03:02.420 --> 03:05.240]  So I was running around the gaff, as Gavin would say,
[03:05.300 --> 03:08.520]  looking for a cup or something that I could just transfer water from the sink,
[03:09.240 --> 03:14.120]  tap into the back of the bowl just so that I could flush faster.
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.040]  So we don't end up with like a, you know, stinky smell.
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.500]  Why don't modern toilets come with a courtesy tank?
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.340]  What do you think is modern about what we got going on there?
[03:25.880 --> 03:28.340]  I don't think we've got modern anything. I'm just saying.
[03:29.040 --> 03:31.280]  You buy a toilet now, it's still got the one tank.
[03:31.900 --> 03:33.180]  You want a reserve tank?
[03:33.480 --> 03:35.320]  I want a reserve tank for the main flush.
[03:35.320 --> 03:38.680]  And I want a courtesy tank for like 70% of the way through.
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.840]  Is it like in a movie when they detonate like a bomb or something important
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.680]  where you got to put a key in and twist it before you can activate the second reserve tank?
[03:47.880 --> 03:49.640]  You need two keys to unlock this.
[03:50.060 --> 03:52.060]  I think so. And it's on both sides of the toilet.
[03:53.440 --> 03:54.940]  You just spread arms.
[03:55.300 --> 03:55.560]  Yeah.
[03:56.820 --> 04:00.520]  Because you don't want to deploy both tanks at the same time.
[04:00.820 --> 04:01.520]  That'd be too much.
[04:01.660 --> 04:03.900]  That'd be... I think that's diminishing returns.
[04:03.900 --> 04:05.700]  I think it was just gonna overflow.
[04:06.040 --> 04:06.360]  Yeah.
[04:07.420 --> 04:10.380]  What if you just doubled the size of one tank?
[04:10.780 --> 04:13.060]  I think also that would fill up the bowl.
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.460]  I would hope it would fill up the bowl. That's what I would like to do.
[04:17.700 --> 04:19.640]  No, I mean like overfill the bowl.
[04:20.340 --> 04:22.140]  Why would it overfill the bowl? It knows when to stop.
[04:23.400 --> 04:25.520]  It's a water pressure thing. It equalizes.
[04:26.500 --> 04:28.260]  So it would never use the bottom half of the tank?
[04:29.180 --> 04:30.960]  Oh, I could get through it pretty quickly, apparently.
[04:32.420 --> 04:38.120]  I could have used that. I could have used a double-sized bowl today to get through shit number two.
[04:38.860 --> 04:42.540]  Man, we're not supposed to be in a doo-doo and vomit era.
[04:42.660 --> 04:44.580]  No, let's move on. You're bringing it there.
[04:44.860 --> 04:48.540]  But it's you. It's you. You're the lighthouse of shit.
[04:48.700 --> 04:54.220]  But you see it in the night. It's cloudy. It comes.
[04:54.760 --> 04:58.260]  Nobody else is aware, but you bring it and you alert us.
[04:58.460 --> 04:59.860]  But who's he signaling to?
[04:59.860 --> 05:02.960]  Uh, all of us. Anybody close to the lighthouse?
[05:03.600 --> 05:04.260]  Other shits?
[05:04.640 --> 05:11.140]  Yeah, I mean, a light a lighthouse is it's not necessarily signaling to one specific person.
[05:11.300 --> 05:14.160]  Everyone kind of sees the lighthouse if you're near it. You know what I mean?
[05:14.580 --> 05:15.420]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:15.840 --> 05:18.720]  You guys are making me feel almost heroic. I appreciate it.
[05:18.800 --> 05:20.000]  Yeah, you shouldn't.
[05:20.020 --> 05:22.960]  Can I submit an emergency second nickname for Geoff?
[05:23.460 --> 05:23.660]  Yep.
[05:24.180 --> 05:24.900]  The shite house.
[05:27.300 --> 05:29.580]  It's pretty good if we lived in another country. I like that.
[05:29.580 --> 05:30.200]  That's pretty good.
[05:30.540 --> 05:32.460]  Yeah, I'll accept it as a secondary.
[05:32.900 --> 05:35.360]  He's a shite house.
[05:38.800 --> 05:40.740]  Anyway, what were we even talking about?
[05:41.300 --> 05:41.780]  Anniversary.
[05:42.780 --> 05:45.660]  Doing this for one year is insane.
[05:47.100 --> 05:51.600]  You guys went to Al Famoso, who is our merchandising.
[05:51.980 --> 05:53.660]  I don't know. Partner, I guess, would be the word.
[05:53.720 --> 05:55.300]  I don't know what the term would be.
[05:55.680 --> 05:58.320]  How was that? It was a hot dog Thursday, apparently.
[05:58.320 --> 05:59.580]  It was awesome.
[06:01.880 --> 06:03.340]  They didn't just have it for us either.
[06:03.480 --> 06:05.100]  It was like, I thought, man, that's really clever.
[06:05.260 --> 06:07.940]  They know we're hot dog guys and they made this.
[06:08.080 --> 06:09.720]  No, they have a whole hot dog Thursday.
[06:09.860 --> 06:10.960]  They've been doing it for like a year.
[06:11.440 --> 06:14.240]  That is like, they just re-theme it each Thursday.
[06:14.380 --> 06:15.620]  We just got to be this week's theme.
[06:16.040 --> 06:18.600]  It's kind of like when you ring the opening bell at the stock market.
[06:19.300 --> 06:21.480]  They did have a poem for us on the screen, though.
[06:22.080 --> 06:22.720]  They did.
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.580]  They did. They did have a poem.
[06:25.140 --> 06:27.120]  Andrew, I can drop this into...
[06:27.120 --> 06:27.760]  Oh, please.
[06:27.960 --> 06:29.440]  I can drop this into the Discord.
[06:29.660 --> 06:31.240]  It was really cool going there.
[06:31.400 --> 06:32.800]  It was, uh...
[06:32.800 --> 06:35.160]  Is anyone's Discord just a big black screen right now?
[06:35.220 --> 06:35.360]  Nope.
[06:35.880 --> 06:36.440]  Nope, nope.
[06:36.440 --> 06:37.580]  No, mine looks great. Thanks.
[06:39.660 --> 06:40.220]  Mine's fine.
[06:41.480 --> 06:42.760]  So they wrote a poem.
[06:42.860 --> 06:47.420]  Graham, who is one of the people who is showing us around, wrote a poem.
[06:48.100 --> 06:48.960]  It's hot dog Thursday.
[06:49.540 --> 06:50.260]  The sacred, right?
[06:51.300 --> 06:53.260]  Gerplers fizz in the fluorescent light.
[06:53.520 --> 06:56.100]  Protected by falcons with buns in tow.
[06:56.100 --> 06:57.360]  No scrubbing allowed.
[06:57.840 --> 06:58.840]  Just relish and go.
[06:59.740 --> 06:59.920]  Fan-
[06:59.920 --> 07:00.720]  Incredible.
[07:01.140 --> 07:01.440]  Casting.
[07:01.440 --> 07:01.720]  Yeah.
[07:02.100 --> 07:07.820]  And it had four hot dogs in reaction to it, which towards the end of our visit was up to five hot dogs.
[07:08.080 --> 07:09.560]  Five hot dogs.
[07:09.780 --> 07:12.460]  Which is how many hot dogs Nick wanted to eat.
[07:12.560 --> 07:18.440]  But he put the brakes on because he went, the people who work here also want to eat the hot dogs.
[07:21.140 --> 07:22.840]  They're pretty good fucking hot dogs, though.
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.060]  Yeah, it was great.
[07:24.140 --> 07:25.780]  We went, we got so many new ideas.
[07:25.780 --> 07:30.300]  We wrote like a laundry list of new merch ideas that are just like, what if we did?
[07:30.800 --> 07:35.120]  I think we said we have to get all the bad ideas out so that way we can find the good ones in here somewhere.
[07:35.420 --> 07:37.280]  And boy, there are a lot of crazy ideas.
[07:37.680 --> 07:39.780]  I think some of the best are at the very bottom of the list.
[07:39.820 --> 07:40.820]  Maybe the last thing we're-
[07:40.820 --> 07:42.820]  No, I don't know about that, but that's fine.
[07:43.260 --> 07:46.160]  I heard some positive things about hot dogs from several of you.
[07:46.220 --> 07:47.340]  I did not hear from Gavin.
[07:47.440 --> 07:48.400]  Gavin, how were the hot dogs?
[07:48.940 --> 07:51.260]  Oh, everyone filled you in on the hot dog opinions?
[07:51.860 --> 07:54.900]  No, well, they just said Eric and Geoff were like, yeah, they were good.
[07:55.000 --> 07:55.580]  They were great.
[07:55.580 --> 07:59.040]  And then, you know, in the podcast that you're part of, they just said that.
[07:59.180 --> 08:00.900]  And then you didn't say anything.
[08:01.420 --> 08:03.760]  And you've been critical of dogs in the past.
[08:04.280 --> 08:05.000]  It was a great dog.
[08:05.520 --> 08:10.800]  Mine was slightly messy because I decided I would go left-hand ketchup, right-hand mustard
[08:10.800 --> 08:12.240]  and do a simultaneous blast.
[08:12.420 --> 08:12.800]  Yeah.
[08:12.900 --> 08:16.620]  And it wasn't the tidiest, but it was a great dog.
[08:16.860 --> 08:17.380]  That's okay.
[08:17.460 --> 08:19.300]  Eric dropped the, uh...
[08:19.300 --> 08:20.620]  He dropped the tongs, the dog tongs.
[08:20.620 --> 08:21.500]  I dropped the tongs.
[08:21.500 --> 08:22.880]  You dropped the tongs?
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.220]  I dropped the dog tongs.
[08:24.220 --> 08:24.680]  It's okay.
[08:24.820 --> 08:26.280]  They got washed off and delivered.
[08:26.860 --> 08:28.020]  Everybody saw it, too.
[08:28.420 --> 08:31.420]  Barging to the front of the line, flinging tongs everywhere.
[08:31.680 --> 08:34.160]  I just started saying, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff.
[08:36.980 --> 08:38.320]  It really worked out for me.
[08:39.080 --> 08:41.960]  But can I ask, Nick, why did you just update your hot dog count?
[08:42.040 --> 08:43.100]  Did you just eat another hot dog?
[08:43.680 --> 08:44.900]  Uh, I forgot to add it.
[08:44.940 --> 08:46.780]  I stopped at a quick trip on the way home.
[08:47.820 --> 08:48.860]  Are you serious?
[08:49.300 --> 08:51.120]  You got a hot dog on the way?
[08:51.840 --> 08:53.540]  Yeah, on the way home from...
[08:53.540 --> 08:56.580]  There was a discussion in the car about how hot dogs,
[08:56.620 --> 08:59.500]  eating hot dogs had reignited some passions in people.
[08:59.740 --> 08:59.920]  Yeah.
[09:01.020 --> 09:04.160]  And, uh, I went out of my way to swing by a quick trip.
[09:04.240 --> 09:06.640]  Got a roller dog and a steamed bun.
[09:06.740 --> 09:08.280]  They have a lot of good condiments.
[09:08.500 --> 09:09.040]  I had a good time.
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.420]  Jesus Christ, Nick.
[09:10.420 --> 09:13.000]  Did you think about pocketing a dog where the dog's gone?
[09:13.060 --> 09:14.020]  How many dogs are left?
[09:14.720 --> 09:15.520]  Oh, plenty.
[09:15.780 --> 09:16.320]  So many.
[09:16.600 --> 09:18.420]  There, there, there were, there were a lot of hot dogs.
[09:18.420 --> 09:19.660]  There were like a dozen dogs in there, so.
[09:20.220 --> 09:21.620]  Yeah, but I felt guilty taking it.
[09:21.980 --> 09:24.560]  It felt like I was taking one from the folks who were working there.
[09:24.700 --> 09:26.680]  How many dogs did you have while you were there, Nick?
[09:27.080 --> 09:27.340]  One.
[09:27.880 --> 09:30.060]  Oh, you definitely could get a second dog.
[09:31.460 --> 09:32.580]  Somebody else did. I felt weird.
[09:33.100 --> 09:34.280]  So I got one at a quick trip.
[09:34.920 --> 09:37.160]  Andrew, would you be the one to go for the second dog there?
[09:37.280 --> 09:37.840]  I would absolutely.
[09:38.020 --> 09:42.400]  If there is a large surplus of dogs available and they offered, I'm taking a dog on the go.
[09:42.960 --> 09:45.700]  I would have got, if you would have done that, I would have gotten a second dog.
[09:46.700 --> 09:49.300]  Oh, I was just waiting for Eric before I got the second dog.
[09:49.300 --> 09:55.220]  I didn't want to drop the tongs again, so I wanted to let somebody else get after it, you know?
[09:55.480 --> 09:58.700]  I would never be first for seconds because I hadn't done a head count
[09:58.700 --> 10:01.800]  and I didn't know how many people had already had one.
[10:02.160 --> 10:05.040]  Right. Plus it's hot dogs and it's hard for you to eat even one.
[10:05.220 --> 10:07.060]  So I just can't imagine you eating a second.
[10:07.700 --> 10:10.140]  For the average person, I think one dog is not enough.
[10:10.480 --> 10:13.820]  I think you got to expect a two dog allowance if you're doing a cookout type thing.
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.560]  I mean, I could easily put four dogs down.
[10:16.480 --> 10:16.880]  Easily.
[10:17.120 --> 10:17.720]  Even when I see it.
[10:17.720 --> 10:21.020]  Yeah, you're going to double your yearly count in one sitting.
[10:21.260 --> 10:23.480]  Big fucking talk.
[10:23.820 --> 10:24.500]  Prove it.
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.680]  Big talk, buddy.
[10:26.880 --> 10:29.000]  Why don't you back it up under... okay.
[10:30.220 --> 10:31.060]  How long?
[10:32.380 --> 10:33.420]  How long?
[10:33.780 --> 10:35.120]  How long will it take you to eat four hot dogs?
[10:35.760 --> 10:37.120]  Oh, four minutes?
[10:37.680 --> 10:38.260]  Fuck you.
[10:38.600 --> 10:39.120]  What?
[10:39.680 --> 10:40.880]  You're not a fast eater.
[10:42.280 --> 10:43.840]  This is burger confidence.
[10:44.600 --> 10:45.900]  Okay, can I have a bonus minute?
[10:45.900 --> 10:48.020]  You can have a bonus eight minutes.
[10:48.020 --> 10:49.700]  Hey, hey, hey, you know what?
[10:49.960 --> 10:51.820]  No, benevolently, yes.
[10:52.120 --> 10:53.360]  You can have one bonus minute.
[10:53.380 --> 10:55.120]  Oh, well, we're throwing stuff out there, Gavin.
[10:55.200 --> 10:56.260]  I need your audio for the...
[10:57.300 --> 10:58.460]  Oh, bleep that.
[10:58.820 --> 10:59.760]  That needs to be surprised.
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.100]  Oh, no way.
[11:02.780 --> 11:03.340]  But the strike.
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.340]  I got excited about the strike.
[11:04.500 --> 11:05.660]  You need my audio for what?
[11:05.980 --> 11:08.860]  The video that you recorded with Geoff.
[11:09.260 --> 11:10.280]  I already edited it.
[11:10.900 --> 11:11.740]  Oh, okay.
[11:11.880 --> 11:12.400]  Well, never mind.
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.240]  Yeah, well, you take that strike and shove it right up your ass.
[11:16.420 --> 11:17.360]  Wow, what a twist.
[11:18.700 --> 11:19.940]  We went to the replay.
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.760]  The coach challenged and the coach is correct.
[11:23.260 --> 11:25.280]  Ruling on the field was wrong.
[11:27.140 --> 11:27.800]  That's awesome.
[11:28.080 --> 11:28.820]  Oh, I'm so glad.
[11:29.500 --> 11:31.160]  Gavin tapped his helmet twice.
[11:31.580 --> 11:32.500]  We got the replay.
[11:32.740 --> 11:33.220]  No strike.
[11:33.920 --> 11:35.120]  That was phenomenal, Gavin.
[11:35.400 --> 11:39.060]  I will say it's on me because I don't think I ever made it clear that I was going to take
[11:39.060 --> 11:40.620]  that one, but I just did it in some free time.
[11:40.620 --> 11:43.840]  It's been in my head of like, oh, I need to make sure I get that out to somebody to make
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.640]  sure it's ready.
[11:44.820 --> 11:45.860]  And then I yeah.
[11:46.300 --> 11:48.200]  How did it turn out, Gavin?
[11:48.600 --> 11:49.480]  I thought it turned out lovely.
[11:49.920 --> 11:50.200]  Great.
[11:50.460 --> 11:51.320]  I can't wait to see it.
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.300]  Wow.
[11:52.680 --> 11:53.700]  That what a twist.
[11:53.940 --> 11:54.600]  That was great.
[11:54.740 --> 11:55.400]  That was great.
[11:55.580 --> 11:55.780]  Wow.
[11:56.040 --> 11:59.220]  I do want to do a little bit of a I do want to get back in there.
[11:59.300 --> 12:00.900]  Just do like one shot.
[12:01.360 --> 12:01.900]  Oh, OK.
[12:02.340 --> 12:05.220]  It probably shouldn't say too, too much about what we're talking about.
[12:05.300 --> 12:06.380]  One, one bleep shot.
[12:06.500 --> 12:07.060]  I'll bleep that too.
[12:07.200 --> 12:07.660]  I'll bleep that.
[12:08.100 --> 12:08.300]  Yeah.
[12:08.680 --> 12:08.880]  Sorry.
[12:10.180 --> 12:12.420]  So you guys had a good time with hot dogs.
[12:12.540 --> 12:13.560]  Gavin had one hot dog.
[12:13.640 --> 12:16.540]  Everyone had one hot dog, but most of you would have had two if somebody else would
[12:16.540 --> 12:17.540]  have broached it first.
[12:18.060 --> 12:18.460]  Definitely.
[12:18.800 --> 12:22.920]  And and at El Famoso today, the reason one of the reasons that we went, we hadn't been
[12:22.920 --> 12:23.300]  there yet.
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.240]  The patch shirt is ready and we got our hands on it.
[12:30.280 --> 12:34.820]  Dude, Andrew, this is I cannot believe I can't believe it's real.
[12:34.820 --> 12:38.060]  One, two, the velcro on it.
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.600]  Incredible rocks from a distance.
[12:40.700 --> 12:42.140]  Throwing the patch on it works.
[12:42.280 --> 12:42.620]  Got on.
[12:43.180 --> 12:45.000]  You got it from distance.
[12:45.700 --> 12:45.920]  Yes.
[12:45.980 --> 12:47.100]  Gavin did on his third try.
[12:47.300 --> 12:47.340]  Yeah.
[12:47.400 --> 12:47.660]  Oh, yeah.
[12:47.880 --> 12:48.280]  Wow.
[12:48.740 --> 12:49.720]  It was pretty incredible.
[12:50.040 --> 12:50.600]  You can fling it on.
[12:50.700 --> 12:53.760]  I assume when that shirt's new, it's going to be brilliant for throwing games.
[12:54.020 --> 12:54.260]  Yes.
[12:54.300 --> 12:57.380]  But I was impressed because it's such a big surface area.
[12:57.500 --> 13:00.960]  Velcro really takes some doing to to pull it off.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.060]  It's not going to come off by accident.
[13:02.100 --> 13:02.920]  I don't think.
[13:02.920 --> 13:03.240]  No.
[13:03.780 --> 13:05.880]  Can we explain the patch shirt fully?
[13:06.200 --> 13:07.640]  I feel like we haven't talked about it in a while.
[13:07.740 --> 13:10.680]  We we've talked about it a little bit, but it's been a while.
[13:11.520 --> 13:13.960]  Uh, where does anyone remember where it came from?
[13:14.020 --> 13:14.340]  Was it?
[13:14.700 --> 13:20.240]  Well, originally we we talked about not having the the asterisk on the regulation shirt.
[13:20.720 --> 13:25.960]  And then I thought after we'd already sold it that maybe it'd be good if we did have a
[13:25.960 --> 13:26.940]  logo on it.
[13:26.940 --> 13:31.300]  And then I was like, oh, what if we just patched the shirt like a shitty piece of software?
[13:31.300 --> 13:34.760]  And then that evolved into a shirt with just a patch spot.
[13:34.780 --> 13:37.860]  A patch, but that will continue to be updated.
[13:38.040 --> 13:38.960]  It'll have a patch.
[13:39.140 --> 13:39.260]  Yeah.
[13:39.260 --> 13:39.440]  Yeah.
[13:39.480 --> 13:43.900]  It'd be like, uh, imagine DLC, which everyone loves.
[13:43.980 --> 13:45.500]  We know how much you love DLC.
[13:45.760 --> 13:49.060]  And that's why this shirt, this shirt is for the future.
[13:49.520 --> 13:50.460]  Well, think of it this way.
[13:50.820 --> 13:55.320]  It's like a six or a seven or an eight or whatever your appetite for patches is in one.
[13:55.680 --> 13:57.720]  Today you wear it, you pop it on.
[13:57.780 --> 13:58.880]  It's got a butthole on it.
[13:59.220 --> 14:00.540]  Tomorrow it's got an Ian.
[14:00.540 --> 14:03.400]  The next day it's got a falcon on it.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.300]  I don't know.
[14:04.580 --> 14:05.980]  It's a different shirt every day.
[14:06.060 --> 14:07.760]  Nobody's going to be like, hey, didn't you wear that shirt yesterday?
[14:07.860 --> 14:09.440]  And you'd be like, no, that was the regulation butthole.
[14:09.540 --> 14:10.400]  This is a falcon.
[14:10.500 --> 14:11.200]  What are you talking about?
[14:11.240 --> 14:12.280]  And they're like, oh, that's a good point.
[14:12.480 --> 14:13.040]  It's totally different.
[14:13.140 --> 14:14.700]  And by butthole, you mean the asterisk that we call it.
[14:14.700 --> 14:15.780]  The asterisk, the show logo.
[14:16.080 --> 14:16.520]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:16.940 --> 14:17.240]  The butthole.
[14:17.700 --> 14:18.820]  That'll be on sale.
[14:19.620 --> 14:23.400]  So we're going to put this on sale on May 11th.
[14:23.640 --> 14:25.040]  Which is our actual anniversary date.
[14:25.400 --> 14:28.940]  Yeah, that which is the anniversary of our company.
[14:29.300 --> 14:30.020]  Very exciting.
[14:30.660 --> 14:32.640]  But I don't think we've decided on a time yet.
[14:33.180 --> 14:35.900]  It might be noon central, but stay tuned.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.500]  We'll let you know as we get closer.
[14:37.720 --> 14:39.020]  I thought we locked in time.
[14:39.120 --> 14:39.520]  Did we not?
[14:40.080 --> 14:41.960]  Don't think we've talked about a time at all.
[14:42.080 --> 14:44.080]  Excited to find out what time you think we locked in.
[14:44.620 --> 14:45.940]  Didn't we have a whole conversation?
[14:46.340 --> 14:48.640]  That was a different time.
[14:49.960 --> 14:50.380]  Got it.
[14:51.020 --> 14:51.780]  What conversation?
[14:52.340 --> 14:53.180]  What did you...
[14:53.180 --> 14:53.420]  I understand.
[14:53.420 --> 14:55.540]  I understand the confusion and the overlap there.
[14:55.560 --> 14:55.740]  I do too.
[14:56.320 --> 14:57.400]  Totally understand that.
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.380]  But should we, before we all yell at each other
[14:59.380 --> 15:00.760]  and then dress each other down for a bit,
[15:01.380 --> 15:03.960]  as is custom on the one year anniversary,
[15:05.380 --> 15:07.860]  should we discuss other items of merchandise?
[15:07.980 --> 15:11.120]  Because we've been doing a lot of work in the background for the anniversary,
[15:11.120 --> 15:13.100]  but we haven't really talked about it too much.
[15:13.100 --> 15:16.940]  Because with most things, we're scared if it gets fucked up in transit
[15:16.940 --> 15:18.360]  or something falls through.
[15:18.440 --> 15:23.000]  Or it turns out that putting a Velcro on a t-shirt is the dumbest idea ever.
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.600]  And the Velcro just rips off the first time you try to use it or something like that.
[15:26.980 --> 15:29.200]  You know, then we haven't gotten you all worked up over nothing.
[15:29.380 --> 15:31.240]  But we've been developing a lot of stuff in the back
[15:31.240 --> 15:33.680]  and it's all going to come out on the anniversary.
[15:34.060 --> 15:36.120]  Do we want to... I mean, we should probably promote that.
[15:36.740 --> 15:37.400]  Yeah, of course.
[15:37.940 --> 15:38.760]  We got the patch shirts.
[15:39.060 --> 15:39.700]  We got patches.
[15:40.280 --> 15:42.060]  If you don't want the shirt, you can just get a patch.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.660]  It's true. You can just buy the patch.
[15:44.100 --> 15:44.260]  Yeah.
[15:44.720 --> 15:46.660]  We have Kuzlers coming back.
[15:47.580 --> 15:49.000]  How many did we order, Eric?
[15:49.460 --> 15:50.800]  I don't remember offhand.
[15:51.780 --> 15:53.720]  But it's more than we had last time.
[15:54.080 --> 15:55.940]  So again, if you have a Gerpler,
[15:56.220 --> 15:57.920]  then maybe you're looking for the Kuzler.
[15:57.920 --> 15:59.860]  Kuzler is going to be resupplied.
[16:00.140 --> 16:01.460]  Kuzler is going to be resupplied.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.120]  And we're back in.
[16:05.260 --> 16:08.840]  And there is at least one other item that I can think of,
[16:08.880 --> 16:10.000]  which I'm excited about.
[16:10.380 --> 16:12.440]  You were just about to promo it, Andrew, I believe.
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.140]  Is our idiot flag.
[16:15.400 --> 16:16.180]  Yeah, give me one.
[16:16.540 --> 16:16.920]  Give me one.
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.520]  I need one.
[16:17.660 --> 16:18.880]  I need two, technically.
[16:19.220 --> 16:20.220]  Maybe three.
[16:20.660 --> 16:23.840]  It's been a run because I got the Gavin false strike.
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.080]  I got the assumption on a time that we scheduled.
[16:28.240 --> 16:30.460]  I now think I understand why I went wrong with that.
[16:30.940 --> 16:34.460]  And a product release for a thing we don't have.
[16:34.800 --> 16:36.360]  I need to raise all three.
[16:36.920 --> 16:37.060]  Yep.
[16:37.260 --> 16:39.140]  Do you think it should be a strike system?
[16:39.260 --> 16:42.260]  Like if you get five strikes, you have to leave the episode.
[16:42.960 --> 16:43.840]  Within one?
[16:44.260 --> 16:44.840]  Oh, man.
[16:45.420 --> 16:45.900]  Uh-oh.
[16:46.680 --> 16:50.200]  So the Kuzler, the idiot flag, and the patch shirt,
[16:50.340 --> 16:51.180]  and also the patch,
[16:51.180 --> 16:56.720]  will be available on May 11th, which is our anniversary day.
[16:57.160 --> 16:58.600]  At what time?
[16:58.900 --> 16:59.260]  Noon?
[16:59.460 --> 16:59.880]  Central?
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.220]  Sounds good to me.
[17:01.820 --> 17:02.480]  Sounds good to me.
[17:02.660 --> 17:03.560]  Noon Central.
[17:04.420 --> 17:09.080]  So stay tuned to regulation store dot store regulation.
[17:10.580 --> 17:11.860]  Gavin, what is it?
[17:13.320 --> 17:17.860]  Regulation store dot com or regulation store dot...
[17:17.860 --> 17:19.240]  Hang on, let me make sure this still works.
[17:20.500 --> 17:22.680]  Regulation store dot store still works, great.
[17:22.920 --> 17:23.080]  Hell yeah.
[17:23.300 --> 17:27.740]  We'll also have a resupply, a restock of the regulation shirt.
[17:28.200 --> 17:31.180]  So if you want to represent regulation the classic way,
[17:31.320 --> 17:32.560]  you can do that as well.
[17:32.820 --> 17:36.020]  That'll be May 11th at noon.
[17:36.260 --> 17:40.800]  But on May 11th at 11 a.m. Central time,
[17:40.920 --> 17:46.680]  we are going to go live on Twitch to celebrate our anniversary.
[17:46.980 --> 17:48.660]  We have some special stuff lined up.
[17:49.120 --> 17:54.620]  A fun day of games and more on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod.
[17:54.720 --> 17:55.620]  I'm excited about that.
[17:56.000 --> 17:56.560]  I can't wait.
[17:57.220 --> 17:58.160]  The return of Dilkong.
[17:58.540 --> 17:59.520]  The revenge of Dilkong.
[17:59.740 --> 18:00.660]  Not really the revenge.
[18:00.840 --> 18:01.500]  I betrayed.
[18:01.740 --> 18:03.800]  I was the betrayer and then it all fell apart.
[18:03.880 --> 18:05.600]  So I guess that's not technically revenge.
[18:06.040 --> 18:08.620]  But Dilkong gets a second chance.
[18:11.020 --> 18:12.300]  Dilkong's coming out of the ashes.
[18:12.960 --> 18:17.180]  Before Gavin and Nick got here, it was Geoff going,
[18:17.180 --> 18:18.640]  we make a secret alliance.
[18:20.640 --> 18:24.320]  On the 11th, we're going to do a 30 turn Mario Party for you guys.
[18:24.400 --> 18:25.180]  We're going to do it live.
[18:26.180 --> 18:28.100]  And Geoff wanted to make a secret alliance.
[18:28.300 --> 18:30.860]  And Andrew immediately shot it down because he said,
[18:30.960 --> 18:32.320]  no, because you always go random.
[18:32.540 --> 18:34.360]  It's what we were doing.
[18:34.680 --> 18:35.980]  Mario Party March.
[18:36.620 --> 18:38.300]  Every time you'd go random, Geoff,
[18:38.320 --> 18:43.500]  I felt like Llewellyn Moss's wife from No Country for Old Men at the end of the movie.
[18:43.600 --> 18:46.080]  Or I'm just like, you're hiding behind the coin.
[18:46.080 --> 18:47.580]  You're making the choice.
[18:48.200 --> 18:51.020]  Every time I just felt like, no, you do it.
[18:51.360 --> 18:53.400]  You're going to say it's random and that it's not you.
[18:53.440 --> 18:54.900]  But it is you. You get the choice.
[18:56.060 --> 18:57.400]  You did have a choice.
[18:57.940 --> 18:59.340]  Antoine Chigurh down there.
[18:59.780 --> 19:01.180]  I wanted to let fate decide.
[19:01.640 --> 19:04.140]  Wouldn't the alliance lock him into not doing the random?
[19:04.760 --> 19:05.720]  No, I don't trust.
[19:06.020 --> 19:09.720]  I think that if you make an alliance with Geoff, he's locked into the random.
[19:10.100 --> 19:13.080]  Speaking to Gavin specifically here and Nick as well,
[19:13.620 --> 19:15.100]  all options are on the table.
[19:15.100 --> 19:16.920]  I'm malleable.
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.720]  I'm like, you guys know Mr. Fantastic.
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.020]  You guys know Plastic Man.
[19:20.140 --> 19:23.860]  I can do that with my personality and my morals.
[19:24.540 --> 19:25.460]  So morph.
[19:26.240 --> 19:27.480]  Yeah, whatever you need.
[19:27.660 --> 19:29.300]  Yeah, I'm available to purchase as well.
[19:29.440 --> 19:30.080]  You can buy me.
[19:30.460 --> 19:30.980]  Oh, wow.
[19:31.440 --> 19:33.160]  Until I was betrayed by Dilkong,
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.220]  I was in an alliance with anyone who suggested anything.
[19:37.340 --> 19:38.920]  If someone suggested something, I just did it.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.820]  I was just saying yes to whatever someone typed to me on Slack.
[19:42.820 --> 19:43.740]  Then it became personal.
[19:46.020 --> 19:48.060]  Yeah, the making it personal was not.
[19:48.640 --> 19:52.560]  And when I look back on it, not the greatest strategic decision.
[19:53.040 --> 19:55.020]  Things did not go well for me after that.
[19:55.280 --> 19:57.960]  I mean, it was a powerful move that particular episode.
[19:58.380 --> 19:59.620]  It was. It was a great moment.
[19:59.840 --> 20:01.680]  And then it was a lot of bad.
[20:02.080 --> 20:07.000]  It was like I climbed the tree and then fell down and hit every branch as soon as I reached the top.
[20:07.200 --> 20:09.600]  It was funny at first as you hit the first nine branches,
[20:09.600 --> 20:12.740]  but towards the end, you were just getting like slapped down beneath the ground.
[20:12.820 --> 20:13.620]  And it was kind of sad.
[20:14.260 --> 20:17.300]  My my wife and I were talking this morning and she asked me,
[20:17.400 --> 20:19.280]  we were just discussing different production things,
[20:19.320 --> 20:24.440]  and she asked me if I thought that doing in retrospect now that the 30 turn Mario Party
[20:24.440 --> 20:26.400]  was worth it, the effort that we put into it.
[20:26.760 --> 20:31.260]  And I told her, I think it was maybe the most worth it thing we've done.
[20:31.320 --> 20:31.840]  Yeah, it was great.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.720]  Oh, I totally agree. I thought it was fantastic.
[20:35.220 --> 20:36.600]  Yeah, the response was incredible.
[20:37.040 --> 20:38.820]  Yeah, I think the response was great.
[20:38.900 --> 20:41.040]  I think it was a lot of fun at the time, too,
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.400]  where there would just be certain days where you're like, I don't know about this.
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.360]  And other days where you're like, this is the best thing we've ever filmed.
[20:46.480 --> 20:47.560]  I think this might be it.
[20:47.740 --> 20:51.860]  When Nick just kept getting slammed, like on one turn,
[20:51.920 --> 20:53.860]  it was like, this is the funniest thing I think we've ever done.
[20:54.060 --> 20:55.120]  I think this might be it.
[20:55.720 --> 20:56.880]  Yeah, it was funny.
[20:57.120 --> 21:00.340]  Yeah, whenever it's, I mean, a huge amount of work to do,
[21:00.400 --> 21:03.400]  but whenever we're able to release content daily with the audience,
[21:03.420 --> 21:04.240]  I think it's so cool.
[21:04.680 --> 21:09.380]  And it like creates a different feel to it of like everyone is along for this
[21:09.380 --> 21:12.240]  sort of live event type thing that lasts a month.
[21:12.300 --> 21:14.300]  Like not many things go a full month.
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.800]  So it's just a really unique and fun thing to experience.
[21:18.240 --> 21:19.360]  Yeah, it was very fun.
[21:21.020 --> 21:23.660]  When you're starting a business, it's insanely stressful.
[21:23.960 --> 21:27.600]  It feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once, and as you proceed, they only multiply.
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.640]  It's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service like Shopify.
[21:31.320 --> 21:33.640]  Shopify, in my opinion, is the best at what it does.
[21:33.980 --> 21:37.320]  And knowing that we have all the support and tools it provides is the best feeling.

[22:30.400 --> 22:33.300]  I don't want to imagine having to navigate those things without it.

[24:23.320 --> 24:25.580]  So get home from church, which Geoff thinks you go to,
[24:25.940 --> 24:28.780]  and tune in on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod.
[24:28.940 --> 24:34.040]  And then we'll have our merch on sale at noon, but also on May 10th, the day before the anniversary.
[24:34.860 --> 24:36.720]  Something special for you as well.
[24:36.980 --> 24:41.340]  So keep your eyes peeled for that on Saturday, May 10th.
[24:41.580 --> 24:46.380]  Unfortunately, that is my birthday and I don't love what is coming.
[24:46.380 --> 24:49.020]  I didn't even think about that. That's incredible.
[24:50.080 --> 24:52.000]  I don't love it.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.580]  Well, let's see. Last year birthday, we all lost our jobs.
[24:56.780 --> 24:57.760]  So is it as bad as that?
[24:58.180 --> 25:01.360]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:01.360 --> 25:03.380]  It's sort of weirdly connected to that, though.
[25:03.540 --> 25:07.160]  Yeah, yeah. One year ago at this time, I had health insurance.
[25:07.200 --> 25:11.260]  And then on my birthday, that was that quickly they slashed it and went away.
[25:11.260 --> 25:20.000]  And now still insuranceless and having to have something special come out on May 10th, Saturday, May 10th, my birthday.
[25:20.840 --> 25:23.020]  You won't be insuranceless for much longer.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.800]  No, no, we're not going to be insuranceless.
[25:25.100 --> 25:25.840]  We're almost past that.
[25:25.880 --> 25:27.320]  We're so close. We're so close.
[25:27.320 --> 25:27.640]  I don't know about that.
[25:27.860 --> 25:29.180]  Email today, so close, so close.
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.460]  I do like the idea of you possibly losing your job on the same day.
[25:33.760 --> 25:36.620]  Thanks man, thank you. Thank you so much.
[25:36.820 --> 25:37.260]  Appreciate that.
[25:37.800 --> 25:46.720]  What if every May 11th, we open up the voting and one by one vote if anyone gets removed from the company?
[25:47.040 --> 25:47.800]  That's a terrible idea.
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.800]  I know who I'm voting for.
[25:52.800 --> 25:57.740]  I mean, surely we've all done decent work this year and we would all vote for everyone to stay.
[25:58.420 --> 26:00.040]  What are you afraid of?
[26:00.900 --> 26:02.040]  That's a terrible practice.
[26:02.440 --> 26:03.980]  All right, let's see who lives in fear.
[26:04.700 --> 26:06.020]  I'm afraid of the bit.
[26:06.600 --> 26:09.280]  Yeah, no, I don't think it's a serious vote.
[26:09.360 --> 26:10.420]  It's a serious business vote.
[26:10.480 --> 26:15.000]  And, you know, the secretary, the president will have to, I assume, physically sign off on the result.
[26:15.460 --> 26:16.700]  It's not a joke.
[26:17.300 --> 26:20.300]  I don't want to lose my job in a survivor setting.
[26:20.360 --> 26:21.540]  What are you talking about?
[26:21.580 --> 26:22.360]  It's not survivor.
[26:22.460 --> 26:23.460]  You don't have to have your torch.
[26:23.560 --> 26:25.200]  There's no torch that has to get snuffed.
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.520]  That's not the point.
[26:26.600 --> 26:27.520]  That's the negative.
[26:29.440 --> 26:34.560]  If it helps, this is the scenario that we have created for Good Morning Gus.
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.500]  Where on the eighth episode, we all have to say whether we want to keep doing the show or not.
[26:41.400 --> 26:43.660]  The end of the first season, we all said yes.
[26:43.740 --> 26:45.300]  The second season is coming soon.
[26:45.740 --> 26:50.000]  And who can say whether or not on the eighth episode we say yes or not.
[26:50.080 --> 26:51.620]  Did Gus play a shot in the dark?
[26:52.360 --> 26:53.480]  Did he have an immunity idol?
[26:54.460 --> 26:56.080]  One in six chance, man.
[26:56.280 --> 26:57.380]  He hung onto it the whole time.
[26:58.600 --> 27:00.360]  I have a question about church.
[27:00.780 --> 27:02.140]  I've been thinking about churches recently.
[27:02.700 --> 27:02.960]  Oh.
[27:04.340 --> 27:06.900]  I just have never really thought about this.
[27:07.320 --> 27:09.400]  Other people were crucified, right?
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.580]  It wasn't just Jesus.
[27:11.080 --> 27:14.240]  Yeah, I think he was crucified next to a bunch of other people.
[27:14.700 --> 27:19.180]  Yeah, the crucifixion was a form of like, it's like lethal injection.
[27:19.540 --> 27:21.480]  Like, okay, it's the way people died.
[27:21.560 --> 27:25.680]  It's not, it's not like it was only, it wasn't special for Christ.
[27:25.880 --> 27:28.760]  It was the way that people were killed.
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.800]  I think it was much less humane deliberately than a lethal injection.
[27:33.880 --> 27:39.700]  Yeah, it's definitely, especially crucifixion, not typically in a cross form,
[27:39.800 --> 27:42.100]  just on a singular post with your hands over your head.
[27:42.200 --> 27:46.600]  It's estimated, just throwing this out there because I wanted to get some kind of
[27:46.600 --> 27:47.660]  Googling involved.
[27:48.140 --> 27:50.500]  So just in case we're really offensive and we're not meaning to be.
[27:51.980 --> 27:55.940]  It's estimated the Romans crucified between 100 and 150,000 people.
[27:56.220 --> 27:56.860]  Holy shit.
[27:56.860 --> 27:58.860]  Yeah, it's a lot of people.
[28:00.140 --> 28:01.920]  Not all at once, but yeah.
[28:02.160 --> 28:04.600]  That would be crazy all at once.
[28:04.960 --> 28:07.980]  And I think for an extra FU, for some people, they would do them upside down.
[28:08.780 --> 28:09.160]  Really?
[28:10.100 --> 28:11.020]  Yeah, yeah.
[28:11.020 --> 28:11.420]  Oh my God.
[28:11.920 --> 28:14.060]  Yeah, I think there were, there are different forms of crucifixion.
[28:14.160 --> 28:19.020]  I don't think the cross necessarily is the, like, be all end all for crucifixion.
[28:19.160 --> 28:24.180]  Was there another significant historical figure that also died that way?
[28:24.180 --> 28:27.700]  Like, it's kind of wild that there's only one, like, famous...
[28:28.640 --> 28:31.140]  that I'm aware of, crucifixion death.
[28:32.500 --> 28:33.280]  I'm looking it up.
[28:33.680 --> 28:35.400]  Second most famous crucified person.
[28:35.800 --> 28:39.300]  That's what, that's what made me wonder if, like, if it happened to other people
[28:39.300 --> 28:40.880]  or if it was, like, a special form.
[28:41.180 --> 28:42.620]  Because I'm not religious in any way.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.420]  I just never really think about this stuff.
[28:44.860 --> 28:46.080]  But we're streaming.
[28:46.900 --> 28:49.880]  Doesn't Christ have a conversation with someone while they're both crucified?
[28:50.500 --> 28:50.860]  Does he?
[28:51.420 --> 28:52.420]  I thought he did.
[28:52.440 --> 28:53.740]  I might be wrong, but I thought he did.
[28:54.180 --> 28:57.020]  A lot of people, a lot of saints got crucified.
[28:57.880 --> 28:59.460]  Well, that makes sense, I guess.
[28:59.620 --> 29:00.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[29:00.420 --> 29:00.660]  Does it?
[29:01.300 --> 29:06.180]  I, well, like, if you're in the realm of people being crucified, if you tell me Jesus was one,
[29:06.840 --> 29:08.360]  saints feel like they'd also be there.
[29:08.520 --> 29:09.780]  I feel like they're kind of related.
[29:10.400 --> 29:16.020]  Yeah, in Luke, Jesus had a conversation with criminals that were crucified alongside him.
[29:16.540 --> 29:16.980]  Interesting.
[29:17.560 --> 29:17.780]  Yeah.
[29:17.860 --> 29:18.140]  Okay.
[29:18.560 --> 29:21.820]  I think I'd be a religious guy if there wasn't so much connotation to it.
[29:21.820 --> 29:23.140]  There just seems like too much.
[29:23.860 --> 29:25.560]  It's too much. I just can't do it.
[29:25.680 --> 29:29.280]  It's, you have to be, it just, it asks so much of you.
[29:30.140 --> 29:32.680]  This is, now, this is how you feel about Blue Prince, right?
[29:32.920 --> 29:37.820]  Yeah, absolutely. Blue Prince and Christianity are so similar to me, where it's just like,
[29:37.860 --> 29:39.680]  this is too much, guys. I don't think so.
[29:41.360 --> 29:44.220]  I'm good at both, and I don't want to be.
[29:44.840 --> 29:49.460]  I was kind of hoping that he was the only one, because if you follow the narrative,
[29:49.460 --> 29:53.000]  let's just say that, like, this is the narrative that is presented of,
[29:53.100 --> 29:54.720]  he dies on the cross, then comes back.
[29:55.100 --> 29:58.020]  Was there a group of people that were like, this just doesn't work?
[29:58.600 --> 30:00.360]  There's something wrong with these crosses.
[30:02.640 --> 30:04.240]  The method was the reason.
[30:04.660 --> 30:07.780]  Yeah, like they blame the tech, like somebody that's just like,
[30:07.860 --> 30:09.560]  fuck, I guess we got to get rid of all these.
[30:10.060 --> 30:11.500]  Third faulty cross this month.
[30:11.740 --> 30:13.780]  Crucifixion, it just doesn't take.
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.100]  Probably not. I never thought about that. That's hilarious.
[30:18.100 --> 30:22.520]  Just the premise of, yeah, like what you would blame, I think, the mechanism
[30:23.020 --> 30:25.400]  ahead of anything else. That would be the most reasonable thing.
[30:25.620 --> 30:28.740]  Dude, I got to say this crucifixion just doesn't kill him enough.
[30:28.880 --> 30:32.160]  This guy came fucking three days later. He's back here. God damn.
[30:32.580 --> 30:37.240]  I just put the cross down. We got to put up a whole new one.
[30:37.820 --> 30:40.200]  Pontius Pilate was out there fucking stabbing him.
[30:40.320 --> 30:42.880]  Three days later, he's out here. God damn.
[30:45.040 --> 30:47.080]  Well, thank you. I was curious about that. I've been wondering.
[30:47.080 --> 30:50.500]  There's somebody on the stream named like Donkey Jesus or something.
[30:50.740 --> 30:52.620]  Somebody was. Crucified Donkey.
[30:52.920 --> 30:54.180]  Crucified Donkey. Yeah.
[30:54.400 --> 30:57.900]  I've been thinking about this since Crucified Donkey was on the stream.
[30:58.360 --> 31:02.200]  The rest of that day, I couldn't stop thinking about Crucified Donkey.
[31:03.780 --> 31:08.780]  Like, do you like people who come into our Twitch stream?
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.440]  Phenomenal names.
[31:11.000 --> 31:11.400]  Phenomenal names.
[31:12.220 --> 31:16.820]  Schindler's Fist and Crucified Donkey are there without fail.
[31:17.080 --> 31:18.980]  It's phenomenal. Love them both.
[31:20.900 --> 31:25.240]  Oh, I throw back to this podcast.
[31:25.540 --> 31:26.960]  The old, old face podcast.
[31:27.460 --> 31:28.300]  I did something.
[31:28.540 --> 31:31.280]  I completed something that was discussed in the past.
[31:31.360 --> 31:33.060]  I have a real opinion on it now.
[31:33.280 --> 31:34.640]  I watched Minority Report.
[31:35.260 --> 31:36.860]  What do you think?
[31:38.520 --> 31:40.100]  Isn't it so blue?
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.540]  It's very blue.
[31:41.700 --> 31:43.580]  It's also like, I don't know,
[31:44.500 --> 31:48.680]  seeing Steven Spielberg's recent work and then seeing that is like, wow, this is fun.
[31:48.780 --> 31:50.300]  This is an actually fun movie.
[31:50.440 --> 31:52.180]  It's kind of crazy that he made this.
[31:52.620 --> 31:55.820]  The perception I have of Spielberg in his modern work, at least.
[31:56.420 --> 31:56.800]  It's a great movie.
[31:56.820 --> 31:59.880]  He's just running around with a bag of his eyes and he's using them.
[31:59.960 --> 32:01.740]  They keep showing his eyeballs in a bag.
[32:01.820 --> 32:02.260]  It's great.
[32:02.440 --> 32:02.640]  Yeah.
[32:02.860 --> 32:05.380]  And then he eats the bad sandwich and drinks the bad milk.
[32:05.640 --> 32:05.900]  Yeah.
[32:07.800 --> 32:09.600]  He's a fun movie.
[32:10.120 --> 32:10.840]  Good movie.
[32:11.060 --> 32:11.840]  Good Tom Cruise movie.
[32:11.840 --> 32:13.660]  I never really understood all of the balls.
[32:13.920 --> 32:15.040]  Why did they use the balls?
[32:15.600 --> 32:17.580]  I think it was it's just like cinematic.
[32:18.060 --> 32:21.180]  I don't think there's any actual like logical reason.
[32:21.280 --> 32:24.000]  I guess, yeah, it's not as interesting to just cut to a fax machine.
[32:24.360 --> 32:29.780]  In my head, it's a dot matrix printer going back and forth.
[32:32.640 --> 32:36.180]  You know, those like gumball machines where you put the whatever quarter in
[32:36.180 --> 32:39.160]  and then it would go through like all the pipes and like, it's just fun to look at.
[32:39.160 --> 32:44.280]  I feel like somebody had that experience and then was like, but what if it was a murder ball?
[32:44.840 --> 32:46.580]  What if it said a murder on it?
[32:47.040 --> 32:47.820]  That'd be even better.
[32:49.340 --> 32:49.920]  It's fun.
[32:50.100 --> 32:50.920]  It's a great movie.
[32:51.320 --> 32:53.880]  You guys know how I don't really watch movies anymore, right?
[32:54.280 --> 32:57.020]  Yeah, well, you were on a kick of it again, like you briefly.
[32:57.340 --> 33:00.020]  But I got I got to like three movie reviews and then I had enough of that bit.
[33:04.240 --> 33:06.600]  I was stuck on the plane to Turkey.
[33:06.600 --> 33:09.060]  I decided to watch a movie that I'd kind of always wanted to see.
[33:09.760 --> 33:12.660]  And so I watched it and then I found out it was the greatest movie ever made.
[33:12.700 --> 33:14.960]  And because of that, I watched the second one,
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.080]  which turns out is even better and the greatest movie ever made.
[33:18.180 --> 33:19.540]  And then I watched the third one.
[33:19.580 --> 33:22.420]  And that turns out is also the greatest movie ever made.
[33:22.480 --> 33:24.220]  And I can't believe I didn't see these three movies.
[33:24.600 --> 33:26.800]  Can you guess what movies I'm talking about?
[33:27.160 --> 33:30.660]  Well, he said three, so that removes the cheaper by the dozen franchise.
[33:32.500 --> 33:33.860]  We're discussing a trilogy.
[33:34.140 --> 33:35.240]  Rush Hour is also out.
[33:35.720 --> 33:38.080]  It's got to be a movie that he's wanted to see.
[33:38.260 --> 33:39.000]  So it's older.
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.360]  There's three of them.
[33:40.480 --> 33:42.580]  You never watched these movies until you were on this plane?
[33:43.300 --> 33:44.940]  No, I know of them.
[33:45.580 --> 33:50.580]  I had seen a previous iteration of the brand, but I'd never seen these movies.
[33:50.820 --> 33:50.860]  No.
[33:52.580 --> 33:53.460]  John Wick.
[33:54.020 --> 33:55.180]  No, I've seen John Wick.
[33:55.240 --> 33:55.460]  No.
[33:55.900 --> 33:58.920]  No, not a trilogy at all.
[33:59.060 --> 33:59.620]  Cannonball Run.
[34:01.860 --> 34:02.940]  I've seen those.
[34:03.120 --> 34:04.900]  I don't know if there's two Smokey and the Bandits.
[34:05.280 --> 34:06.140]  Newer than that.
[34:06.320 --> 34:07.060]  Way newer than that.
[34:08.200 --> 34:09.840]  Is one of them a prequel?
[34:10.600 --> 34:10.760]  No.
[34:11.720 --> 34:12.660]  That's a great guess.
[34:12.660 --> 34:13.460]  Gets out of Dumb and Dumber.
[34:13.800 --> 34:14.180]  Jurassic World.
[34:15.460 --> 34:17.400]  There's no way that he didn't see the Jurassic World.
[34:17.400 --> 34:17.840]  I've seen it.
[34:17.920 --> 34:18.520]  It's not Jurassic World.
[34:19.060 --> 34:19.480]  I've seen this.
[34:19.480 --> 34:21.980]  What is like something on the peripheral that you may not have seen?
[34:22.200 --> 34:22.740]  Mad Max.
[34:22.980 --> 34:24.360]  No, but that's a good guess.
[34:24.660 --> 34:25.680]  But that's not what I'm discussing.
[34:26.080 --> 34:28.020]  Is it an action series or comic?
[34:28.020 --> 34:29.640]  Yeah, I would consider it to be action.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.680]  Okay, consider it to be action.
[34:31.940 --> 34:33.180]  Nothing funny about it.
[34:34.060 --> 34:35.400]  Nothing funny about it.
[34:37.900 --> 34:39.740]  Okay, it's not going to be Godfather.
[34:40.020 --> 34:45.100]  Oh, what's the Clint Eastwood, the fucking...
[34:46.140 --> 34:46.700]  Dirty Harry movies?
[34:47.080 --> 34:49.860]  No, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
[34:49.960 --> 34:51.520]  No, I've seen this many times.
[34:52.180 --> 34:52.360]  Dammit.
[34:53.820 --> 34:55.040]  I could just give it to you too.
[34:55.200 --> 34:56.060]  You guys don't have to guess whatever.
[34:56.300 --> 34:56.860]  Okay, keep going.
[34:56.860 --> 34:58.420]  We're working through it.
[34:59.360 --> 35:00.160]  Are these like...
[35:00.160 --> 35:02.680]  They have to be successful movies because they made three of them.
[35:03.180 --> 35:03.500]  Yes.
[35:05.100 --> 35:07.940]  Was it a series that got progressively less successful?
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.200]  Were any of these straight the DVD?
[35:09.800 --> 35:10.600]  No, no.
[35:10.660 --> 35:10.900]  Okay.
[35:11.100 --> 35:11.520]  Wow.
[35:13.920 --> 35:14.360]  Huh.
[35:14.560 --> 35:15.180]  Come on, Gavin.
[35:15.420 --> 35:17.160]  Three of them that you haven't seen.
[35:17.920 --> 35:19.940]  I guarantee Andrew's seen them all.
[35:21.500 --> 35:22.460]  That's an interesting...
[35:23.120 --> 35:25.360]  How many XXX movies are there?
[35:26.120 --> 35:28.280]  It's not XXX, but that's a great guess.
[35:28.280 --> 35:29.480]  There are three of those.
[35:30.240 --> 35:31.020]  Or three.
[35:31.560 --> 35:33.260]  And you somehow watched one on the Millennium, right?
[35:33.560 --> 35:34.160]  Even though we don't know.
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.460]  All right, I personally give up.
[35:40.920 --> 35:41.300]  Okay.
[35:41.520 --> 35:44.840]  I watched the greatest movies ever made.
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.140]  Denzel Washington in The Equalizer.
[35:47.600 --> 35:48.840]  Holy shit.
[35:49.420 --> 35:51.540]  Holy shit, are those movies fantastic?
[35:52.480 --> 35:54.820]  Yeah, well, they're...
[35:54.820 --> 35:55.820]  Yeah, they're...
[35:55.820 --> 35:56.660]  Like, he's great.
[35:56.820 --> 35:57.960]  He's so good in all of them.
[35:58.520 --> 36:02.000]  And the interactions he has...
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.580]  I think two really drops off for me overall.
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.380]  But his interactions in that movie with the villain are so fucking good.
[36:08.860 --> 36:09.320]  Dude.
[36:09.800 --> 36:13.360]  There's a scene where he's in a parking lot with them in the guy's house.
[36:13.560 --> 36:14.860]  And oh, man, it's good.
[36:15.360 --> 36:15.980]  It's just like...
[36:15.980 --> 36:20.300]  I mean, you know, story-wise, there are moments throughout that aren't perfect.
[36:20.640 --> 36:23.160]  But he is dripping so much charisma.
[36:23.700 --> 36:27.560]  And there are all these little things that they do that just like...
[36:27.560 --> 36:32.300]  I've never watched the same scene like six times in a row before.
[36:32.500 --> 36:33.380]  I don't think.
[36:33.820 --> 36:35.000]  And like, there's a scene...
[36:35.860 --> 36:38.480]  It's just like the first five minutes of three is insane.
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.440]  But when he gets like unexpectedly shot, and he sits down, and he picks up the pistol,
[36:43.480 --> 36:44.820]  and he looks at it, and he does the thing.
[36:45.420 --> 36:48.800]  And then his face is so emotive.
[36:48.860 --> 36:50.700]  And I just had to keep watching it over and over again.
[36:51.040 --> 36:52.280]  He's so fucking cool.
[36:52.440 --> 36:53.480]  And he works at Home Depot.
[36:53.480 --> 36:57.560]  It's like, what if the old guy who worked at Home Depot was actually a badass?
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.460]  And then he is.
[36:58.520 --> 36:59.660]  It's so fucking funny.
[36:59.960 --> 37:01.120]  That's what I was about to ask.
[37:01.220 --> 37:05.500]  I'm like, is Equalizer the one where he works at like the fake Home Depot?
[37:06.020 --> 37:06.360]  Yes.
[37:06.620 --> 37:07.600]  The first one, he's at Home Depot.
[37:07.700 --> 37:09.060]  The second one, he's an Uber driver.
[37:09.220 --> 37:11.420]  And then the third one, he's just on vacation.
[37:11.880 --> 37:13.640]  Is Pedro Pascal in the first one?
[37:13.860 --> 37:14.980]  He's in the second one.
[37:15.140 --> 37:15.580]  Oh, OK.
[37:15.600 --> 37:15.880]  Second one.
[37:16.140 --> 37:16.340]  OK.
[37:16.760 --> 37:18.220]  He gets his aisle fucked up or whatever.
[37:19.120 --> 37:19.480]  That's cool.
[37:20.020 --> 37:23.000]  What I really like about the first one, and they kind of move away from this,
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.260]  in the third one, it doesn't really warrant it at all.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.360]  But he gives the people he's about to fuck up and out every time.
[37:29.440 --> 37:29.620]  Yeah.
[37:29.840 --> 37:32.900]  Like there's always a moment where he's like, I'm going to give you an out here.
[37:33.040 --> 37:34.420]  Will you do the right thing?
[37:34.420 --> 37:35.120]  And they never do.
[37:35.160 --> 37:36.620]  And then he fucks them up and it's awesome.
[37:37.520 --> 37:38.440]  It's so cool.
[37:38.700 --> 37:39.420]  It's so cool.
[37:39.560 --> 37:40.880]  And it progresses in a way.
[37:41.580 --> 37:44.980]  I actually prefer the action to that in John Wick.
[37:45.380 --> 37:46.780]  John Wick goes in opposite direction.
[37:47.140 --> 37:51.760]  Now, I think they do it in the Equalizer because Denzel Washington is an older man as these
[37:51.760 --> 37:55.400]  progress and he's not like you're not going to have them do a bunch of physical stuff.
[37:55.520 --> 37:55.900]  Yeah.
[37:55.900 --> 38:01.980]  Where I kind of get tired in John Wick 3 where every single fight he's doing the same
[38:01.980 --> 38:03.680]  hip throw to the guy.
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.360]  And then like it's every fight scene is so like extended where Denzel Washington,
[38:09.540 --> 38:14.120]  Equalizer 3, is this a dude with a gun that just kills everybody instantly?
[38:14.260 --> 38:17.320]  Like there's no he just mows through people.
[38:17.660 --> 38:17.820]  Yeah.
[38:17.920 --> 38:19.740]  Sort of like a force of nature.
[38:19.740 --> 38:25.260]  And I find that so much more effective in terms of conveying a sense of like,
[38:25.460 --> 38:26.300]  oh, they're fucked.
[38:26.500 --> 38:28.280]  Like there's nothing they can do.
[38:28.620 --> 38:33.220]  You just described, you just described like the reason that I don't really care for the
[38:33.220 --> 38:35.500]  John Wick movies versus something like the Equalizer.
[38:35.780 --> 38:38.560]  Like John Wick is such a movie made by a stunt team.
[38:39.020 --> 38:42.940]  And then the Equalizer feels like how fast can we get this done?
[38:43.020 --> 38:44.220]  And it's like this rocks.
[38:44.300 --> 38:45.400]  I love that shit.
[38:45.700 --> 38:46.320]  It is that.
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.080]  The first John Wick, I feel like is also very much that way of like the club scene.
[38:50.160 --> 38:53.180]  He's just walking through shooting everybody there.
[38:53.260 --> 38:56.460]  It sort of progressively becomes more stunt centric movies.
[38:56.760 --> 38:58.800]  And a lot of people seem to like that.
[38:58.840 --> 38:59.340]  And that's awesome.
[38:59.360 --> 39:05.880]  But I really appreciated Equalizer 3 where it's less about like making these bad guys
[39:05.880 --> 39:07.620]  feel like things that he needs to overcome.
[39:07.780 --> 39:11.240]  And just I'm going to if I get to you, you're fucking dead.
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.860]  It's also cool because it shows how cerebral it is because he's counting
[39:15.860 --> 39:17.180]  the seconds it's going to take.
[39:17.380 --> 39:17.560]  Yes.
[39:17.700 --> 39:20.340]  And he's having conversations with the guy like there's a moment in three when
[39:20.340 --> 39:23.120]  kind of what you're talking about, he's explaining to them that they're fucked
[39:23.120 --> 39:23.900]  and they don't even know it yet.
[39:23.920 --> 39:26.980]  And you're like, he's like, your guy on your left is an inch and a half too close to me.
[39:27.060 --> 39:30.320]  The guy on the right is unfortunately going to get shot in the shoulder because of that.
[39:30.360 --> 39:32.160]  And like he's already working it all out in his head.
[39:32.260 --> 39:34.080]  And you can like kind of see his mind work.
[39:34.180 --> 39:36.260]  And then when everything happens, it's like in a short burst.
[39:36.280 --> 39:37.840]  It's like and then it's done.
[39:38.120 --> 39:41.580]  And so it's like everything is just like he's like super fastidious.
[39:41.680 --> 39:45.180]  He folds his like napkin a certain way and sets the table up.
[39:45.180 --> 39:46.720]  And that's like how he kills people, too.
[39:46.800 --> 39:47.340]  It's really cool.
[39:47.900 --> 39:48.900]  I've never seen a single one.
[39:49.280 --> 39:49.900]  Oh, they're great.
[39:50.160 --> 39:50.740]  You should watch.
[39:50.880 --> 39:51.380]  Yeah, they're great.
[39:51.600 --> 39:56.060]  And that like that that that choice thing Andrew's talking about, like there's a moment
[39:56.060 --> 39:59.680]  on a train where he sits down and talks to a guy who's already fucked.
[39:59.720 --> 40:00.320]  He doesn't know yet.
[40:00.340 --> 40:02.920]  And he's like, there's two kinds of pain in the world.
[40:03.080 --> 40:05.740]  There's pain that hurts and there's pain that alters.
[40:06.280 --> 40:10.420]  I let you choose, you know, and that's like it's fucking just awesome.
[40:11.340 --> 40:11.900]  It's phenomenal.
[40:11.900 --> 40:19.400]  Yeah, it's I, I think one in three are incredibly strong and two has its moments to their sequences
[40:19.400 --> 40:21.980]  in tune that are just like he's such a fucking badass.
[40:22.140 --> 40:22.800]  That's so cool.
[40:23.160 --> 40:23.880]  That's awesome.
[40:24.240 --> 40:26.220]  But they're definitely all we're seeing.
[40:26.520 --> 40:27.920]  And the way they progress is cool.
[40:28.180 --> 40:32.320]  And also, if you're a fan of like Denzel Washington and kind of like a concept of his career,
[40:32.700 --> 40:34.100]  Dakota Fanning's in the third one.
[40:34.160 --> 40:38.120]  And it's just a really cool arc of man on fire to the equalizer three.
[40:38.120 --> 40:41.900]  That's a trilogy 4K box set.
[40:42.500 --> 40:43.800]  Damn, be worth it.
[40:43.800 --> 40:43.980]  Wow.
[40:44.240 --> 40:45.000]  I'm buying that.
[40:45.480 --> 40:45.960]  It's great.
[40:46.560 --> 40:47.940]  You will not regret it.
[40:48.300 --> 40:48.940]  Top tier Denzel.
[40:48.940 --> 40:54.180]  It's sort of funny you bring that up because I've been I went on a journey of trying to
[40:54.180 --> 40:56.700]  watch all the Denzel Washington movies, and I'm still on that.
[40:56.780 --> 40:58.560]  I think I have like nine or ten left.
[40:58.940 --> 41:04.900]  But then I realized that I also have seen almost every Tom Cruise movie by accident.
[41:05.540 --> 41:07.560]  So I've been trying to round that out as well.
[41:07.560 --> 41:09.100]  I think I have eight of those left.
[41:09.420 --> 41:10.020]  Even the mummy?
[41:10.860 --> 41:11.720]  Even the mummy.
[41:12.040 --> 41:12.240]  That one.
[41:12.460 --> 41:13.020]  That's not in the theater.
[41:13.600 --> 41:15.940]  That one took like five or six attempts.
[41:16.100 --> 41:17.580]  Not his worst movie.
[41:18.140 --> 41:18.540]  Shockingly.
[41:18.880 --> 41:20.220]  Might be his worst trailer though.
[41:20.560 --> 41:21.940]  What do you think his worst movie is?
[41:22.220 --> 41:23.500]  Yeah, what do you think it is?
[41:23.560 --> 41:24.360]  What do you think the worst one is?
[41:24.360 --> 41:26.040]  Worst movie by far is Legend.
[41:26.620 --> 41:28.060]  The one he made with Ridley Scott.
[41:28.480 --> 41:30.480]  I don't like Legend when I was a kid.
[41:30.640 --> 41:31.100]  That's terrible.
[41:31.500 --> 41:32.420]  Like a childhood movie.
[41:32.760 --> 41:35.680]  Yeah, I could totally if you're a kid, I could see liking that.
[41:35.680 --> 41:38.920]  It is one of the movies where it has an opening scroll.
[41:39.060 --> 41:42.380]  And I was checked out during the scroll where they were like,
[41:43.100 --> 41:44.980]  Unicorns are the bearer of light.
[41:45.100 --> 41:47.540]  They have light in their soul and they'll combat the dark.
[41:47.640 --> 41:50.200]  And I was like, this isn't for me.
[41:52.500 --> 41:54.940]  Is Legend the one with like the big devil guy?
[41:55.120 --> 41:55.320]  Yes.
[41:55.800 --> 41:58.220]  Yeah, I think it's, is it Tim Curry playing that devil?
[41:58.320 --> 41:58.860]  It is.
[41:58.900 --> 42:00.180]  Yeah, I think it is Tim Curry.
[42:00.600 --> 42:00.980]  It is.
[42:01.020 --> 42:02.500]  Looks like the Dungeon Keeper guy.
[42:03.060 --> 42:08.740]  Yeah, like this is to me like the best representation of crazy demon devil guy.
[42:08.840 --> 42:09.160]  It is.
[42:09.580 --> 42:10.920]  It's great prosthetics.
[42:11.360 --> 42:11.840]  Awesome.
[42:12.160 --> 42:13.480]  Awesome prosthetics, looks incredible.
[42:13.720 --> 42:14.840]  He set the standard with that role.
[42:14.960 --> 42:15.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:16.120 --> 42:19.040]  If the movie's not good, I don't remember the, I don't remember the movie one way or the other.
[42:19.040 --> 42:19.360]  It's so bad.
[42:19.840 --> 42:22.620]  It's not even, it's 80, like four minutes long.
[42:22.740 --> 42:24.960]  So like, you know, you know, it's stretching.
[42:25.260 --> 42:25.980]  It's terrible.
[42:26.980 --> 42:31.480]  A weird pattern I've noticed is Tom Cruise movies that have scrolls in them
[42:31.480 --> 42:32.760]  really not great.
[42:32.920 --> 42:38.480]  I haven't finished four in a way, but that's another one that opens with a scroll and I
[42:38.480 --> 42:39.400]  didn't know anything about it.
[42:39.460 --> 42:44.260]  Like when I watch these movies by these actors specifically, I don't look anything up about
[42:44.260 --> 42:44.440]  them.
[42:44.500 --> 42:46.080]  It's just like, I go on blind and it's fun.
[42:46.320 --> 42:53.620]  And that one opens with a scroll of like set in 1892 Ireland and just going, oh no.
[42:54.020 --> 42:55.720]  So you don't want to read at the beginning of a movie.
[42:56.100 --> 42:57.060]  Insanely popular.
[42:57.400 --> 42:57.580]  Yeah.
[42:57.740 --> 42:58.940]  Insanely popular film.
[42:59.280 --> 43:00.060]  Beloved film.
[43:00.060 --> 43:05.620]  So do you watch Star Wars and you're just like, no, I don't mind the reading.
[43:05.680 --> 43:08.620]  I went, oh no, because it was set in Ireland.
[43:08.660 --> 43:12.700]  And I went, please don't make Tom Cruise be Irish.
[43:13.060 --> 43:14.460]  Yeah, he's just like against them.
[43:14.640 --> 43:18.100]  It's like, it's the era of actors having shitty acts.
[43:18.200 --> 43:20.980]  Like, I don't feel like they try to do that anymore with US actors.
[43:20.980 --> 43:22.540]  They're like, oh, Brad Pitt's big.
[43:22.620 --> 43:24.540]  He'll just play this British guy and it'll be great.
[43:24.640 --> 43:25.680]  And then Snatch happens.
[43:25.840 --> 43:28.820]  Isn't John Lithgow playing Dumbledore right now?
[43:28.820 --> 43:29.180]  Is he?
[43:29.600 --> 43:29.980]  Yeah.
[43:30.340 --> 43:30.500]  Yeah.
[43:30.520 --> 43:31.240]  On the television show.
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.460]  It's a big controversy because they're like, why is this shitty American actor having a
[43:35.460 --> 43:35.880]  British accent?
[43:36.360 --> 43:38.840]  And he's like, I played Winston Churchill.
[43:38.980 --> 43:39.480]  What do you want?
[43:39.680 --> 43:41.600]  Yeah, he did pretty well too.
[43:42.160 --> 43:42.640]  Oh, yeah.
[43:43.060 --> 43:45.300]  Is Tom Cruise jacked in far and away?
[43:45.480 --> 43:48.080]  Or is this just an image of him being close to jacked?
[43:48.460 --> 43:50.100]  Like, he looks big.
[43:50.120 --> 43:51.500]  He looks big in that.
[43:51.600 --> 43:51.760]  Yeah.
[43:51.860 --> 43:53.500]  Well, he plays like a farmer.
[43:54.220 --> 43:56.360]  From what I can tell, that's like plowing the field.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.520]  So it makes sense, I guess.
[43:57.640 --> 43:58.740]  But plowing more than that.
[44:01.100 --> 44:02.860]  Oh, oh, oh.
[44:03.200 --> 44:03.960]  But it's been fun.
[44:04.080 --> 44:08.980]  It's I've been saving sort of like the movies I think would be most enjoyable to me for Denzel
[44:08.980 --> 44:10.500]  and Tom Cruise.
[44:10.820 --> 44:12.020]  Trying to save a few good ones.
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.120]  Tom Cruise would be a person that I would say would be that would index really high
[44:16.120 --> 44:19.600]  on the ratio of good to bad movies in their career list.
[44:19.640 --> 44:20.840]  Like I can I can't.
[44:20.880 --> 44:24.680]  I don't think either either of the movies that you have an issue with are bad.
[44:24.680 --> 44:29.600]  But like I was saying, like Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise are dudes that I just can't
[44:29.600 --> 44:31.340]  think of shitty movies that they participated in.
[44:31.720 --> 44:36.740]  There's weird connections, too, of like I had never seen Rain Man and Rain Man and Mission
[44:36.740 --> 44:39.200]  Impossible two both open with the same song.
[44:39.600 --> 44:44.180]  And I just I wonder if that's complete coincidence because Hans Zimmer did the score for both
[44:44.180 --> 44:44.840]  those movies.
[44:45.320 --> 44:47.240]  Is that a weird connection to Rain Man?
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.300]  I have no idea.
[44:48.440 --> 44:49.960]  But it's just yeah, it's fun.
[44:50.080 --> 44:50.860]  And The Holiday.
[44:51.400 --> 44:53.500]  I would say from what I've seen.
[44:53.500 --> 44:54.260]  What?
[44:54.820 --> 44:55.760]  What about The Holiday?
[44:56.000 --> 44:56.900]  Wait, who's in The Holiday?
[44:57.700 --> 44:58.380]  Yeah, what about it?
[44:58.500 --> 44:59.040]  Hans Zimmer?
[44:59.420 --> 45:01.360]  Hans Zimmer soundtrack score.
[45:01.480 --> 45:03.700]  Oh, he's just throwing out a fact.
[45:03.820 --> 45:05.320]  I think it wasn't really related to that.
[45:06.980 --> 45:11.820]  You associate his films with just absolute banging epic soundtracks and sometimes it's
[45:11.820 --> 45:12.140]  The Holiday.
[45:12.560 --> 45:13.220]  That's kind of weird.
[45:14.260 --> 45:17.640]  I'd say Tom Cruise has five or six bad movies.
[45:18.920 --> 45:22.900]  Like just looking at his IMDb, it's pretty it's pretty strong, man.
[45:22.900 --> 45:26.880]  Like Days of Thunder isn't like a great movie, but it's fine.
[45:27.040 --> 45:27.560]  It's fine.
[45:27.680 --> 45:28.100]  Totally fine.
[45:28.200 --> 45:28.340]  Yeah.
[45:28.800 --> 45:30.680]  Cocktail isn't a great movie.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.720]  The Mummy straight up sucks.
[45:33.220 --> 45:34.500]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:34.540 --> 45:36.320]  I'm okay with Cocktail.
[45:36.320 --> 45:38.440]  Didn't he do that Rock of Ages movie?
[45:39.140 --> 45:43.120]  He did, but that's also like it's it's bad, but like it knows it's bad.
[45:43.180 --> 45:47.200]  It's like it's knowingly corny and he's really good in it.
[45:47.820 --> 45:53.140]  I was that scene has or that movie has a monkey in it called Hey Man, who's awesome.
[45:53.240 --> 45:54.820]  It's like a monkey.
[45:54.900 --> 45:58.400]  He's like Tom Cruise's number one guy and he just fucks things up.
[45:58.500 --> 46:01.900]  And I was watching it and I had the realization this is.
[46:01.980 --> 46:03.240]  What the fuck?
[46:03.740 --> 46:05.580]  Have you not seen Hey Man from Rock Ages?
[46:05.880 --> 46:07.040]  Yeah, he just hangs out.
[46:07.100 --> 46:12.160]  He's his number one guy and he gets him like alcohol or if like he's got an enemy.
[46:12.340 --> 46:14.480]  Hey Man will fuck up the enemy for Tom Cruise.
[46:14.480 --> 46:17.540]  Um, but I realized we're watching it.
[46:18.020 --> 46:22.140]  It is the most inhumane thing that I unapologetically enjoy.
[46:22.500 --> 46:24.080]  And I just have to accept that about myself.
[46:24.740 --> 46:29.820]  They probably shouldn't have a monkey in a movie doing this like this can't be.
[46:30.580 --> 46:32.380]  Is Hey Man's fucking awesome.
[46:32.780 --> 46:35.340]  God, I might have to watch this movie.
[46:35.500 --> 46:36.300]  Look at his bananas.
[46:37.580 --> 46:39.360]  But he's fucking great.
[46:39.720 --> 46:40.760]  This rocks.
[46:41.820 --> 46:43.800]  He's a highly decorated monkey.
[46:44.760 --> 46:45.120]  Yes.
[46:47.500 --> 46:49.660]  Hey Man is awesome.
[46:49.940 --> 46:50.320]  He is.
[46:50.800 --> 46:51.340]  What is that?
[46:51.400 --> 46:52.180]  Is it a baboon?
[46:52.360 --> 46:53.260]  What kind of monkey is that?
[46:53.260 --> 46:54.580]  I think it is a baboon.
[46:54.660 --> 46:55.140]  Okay, I believe.
[46:56.100 --> 46:56.380]  Wow.
[46:56.460 --> 46:56.680]  Yeah.
[46:57.700 --> 46:59.620]  Anyway, I equalize not know about this.
[46:59.820 --> 47:00.300]  That's awesome.
[47:00.580 --> 47:01.620]  Tom Cruise has a lot of good movies.
[47:02.600 --> 47:03.000]  It's true.
[47:03.200 --> 47:05.380]  Those are both true, true statements.
[47:05.980 --> 47:07.880]  Hey, I, uh, I created a game.
[47:07.980 --> 47:08.780]  Do you guys want to play a little game?
[47:08.880 --> 47:09.780]  I want to play your game.
[47:09.960 --> 47:10.860]  Yeah, I hope it's okay.
[47:11.420 --> 47:12.980]  I was thinking the other day.
[47:12.980 --> 47:14.680]  I was going grocery shopping.
[47:14.900 --> 47:16.460]  And I was buying, I was going through the cereal aisle.
[47:16.600 --> 47:19.040]  And I have like four cereals that I cycle through.
[47:19.460 --> 47:24.600]  And I was just kind of lamenting that there aren't more exciting cereals to try.
[47:24.800 --> 47:25.720]  New cereals to try.
[47:26.380 --> 47:29.920]  And I got to thinking, when was the last time a new cereal dropped?
[47:30.380 --> 47:33.060]  When I was a kid, I felt like cereal was coming out left and right.
[47:33.240 --> 47:37.780]  You know, like every year there was a new hot new cereal from some cartoon or something
[47:37.780 --> 47:38.420]  that I wanted to try.
[47:38.700 --> 47:40.280]  And I just don't feel like that's the case anymore.
[47:40.280 --> 47:44.940]  So I started, I looked up some dates and I was just surprised when some cereals launched
[47:44.940 --> 47:45.640]  versus others.
[47:45.940 --> 47:50.960]  And so I've created a little game, uh, where I will throw this out there and you guys can
[47:50.960 --> 47:51.920]  police yourselves.
[47:52.040 --> 47:53.780]  But what came first?
[47:54.320 --> 47:55.960]  Cornflakes or Grape-Nuts?
[47:56.620 --> 47:57.700]  I think Grape-Nuts came first.
[47:57.800 --> 47:58.500]  What the hell are Grape-Nuts?
[47:59.120 --> 48:00.340]  I'm going to say Cornflakes.
[48:01.200 --> 48:01.920]  Well, okay.
[48:02.080 --> 48:02.840]  Let's think about this.
[48:02.880 --> 48:03.780]  Let's talk this out a little bit.
[48:03.780 --> 48:09.140]  Because Cornflakes were made as a way to like stop people from banging is the history of
[48:09.140 --> 48:09.640]  Cornflakes.
[48:09.640 --> 48:10.520]  Jerking off.
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.200]  I mean, wasn't, wasn't it linked to like circumcision and all that stuff?
[48:15.680 --> 48:16.060]  Was it?
[48:16.260 --> 48:17.420]  I don't know about that history.
[48:17.500 --> 48:19.520]  I just thought it was like the anti-sex food.
[48:20.260 --> 48:22.800]  And it was like so bland that it would make people bored.
[48:23.280 --> 48:23.920]  Was the idea.
[48:24.580 --> 48:26.220]  This food is so boring.
[48:26.320 --> 48:27.760]  I'll never jerk off.
[48:27.940 --> 48:29.400]  I think that was the idea.
[48:32.180 --> 48:35.980]  That's not where I saw this contest going, but this game going, but this is awesome.
[48:36.500 --> 48:40.860]  It's the brief thing about cereal, like the small amount of history I know relating to it.
[48:41.040 --> 48:41.740]  I still...
[48:44.340 --> 48:44.920]  Grape-Nuts.
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.980]  I don't think I've ever seen a Grape-Nut, but I've seen a Cornflake.
[48:48.440 --> 48:49.240]  They're crunchy as shit.
[48:49.240 --> 48:50.360]  I'm looking at Grape-Nuts.
[48:51.080 --> 48:52.420]  Where does the grape come in?
[48:53.080 --> 48:53.760]  There's no grape.
[48:54.040 --> 48:54.160]  Oh.
[48:55.040 --> 48:58.940]  I always imagine the California Raisins promoting the Grape-Nuts for some reason.
[48:59.160 --> 48:59.580]  I don't know why.
[48:59.580 --> 49:00.520]  I don't think that ever happened.
[49:00.760 --> 49:02.740]  They probably, probably did Raisin Bran.
[49:03.080 --> 49:03.780]  Grape-Nuts.
[49:03.780 --> 49:07.480]  It looks like the crumbs at the bottom of other cereal.
[49:07.880 --> 49:08.380]  Yeah. Really?
[49:08.860 --> 49:10.560]  I've never seen a Grape-Nut.
[49:11.300 --> 49:12.220]  Oh, I just googled it.
[49:12.580 --> 49:15.320]  Yeah, I understand. I'm just stating that, like, everything...
[49:15.320 --> 49:18.940]  I've heard Grape-Nuts before, so I've always just had to imagine everything relating to it.
[49:19.040 --> 49:20.900]  My wife eats Grape-Nuts, so...
[49:21.680 --> 49:23.140]  Okay, so it's still in the rotation.
[49:23.520 --> 49:23.960]  She loves them!
[49:23.960 --> 49:24.640]  They're fine.
[49:25.340 --> 49:31.040]  I don't know. I think that that is a high bar to set for what Grape-Nuts are.
[49:31.140 --> 49:32.160]  I don't think they're fine.
[49:32.360 --> 49:33.240]  They're fine.
[49:33.240 --> 49:34.380]  I'm gonna say Grape-Nuts.
[49:34.720 --> 49:38.360]  I wouldn't kick him out of bed in the morning, but I wouldn't hunt one down.
[49:39.320 --> 49:40.440]  You're gonna say Grape-Nuts, Andrew?
[49:40.640 --> 49:43.400]  Yeah, I'm locking in Grape-Nuts. I'm going Corn Flakes.
[49:43.700 --> 49:44.660]  Corn Flakes for Eric. Gavin?
[49:45.860 --> 49:47.080]  I'll go Corn Flakes.
[49:47.480 --> 49:47.960]  Okay, Nick?
[49:48.420 --> 49:49.260]  Corn Flakes!
[49:49.620 --> 49:56.360]  Corn Flakes! Kellogg's Corn Flakes launched in 1906, post-Grape-Nuts, released in 1897.
[49:56.840 --> 49:57.280]  Wow!
[49:58.760 --> 50:00.120]  Andrew gets a point there.
[50:00.260 --> 50:00.740]  Feels old.
[50:01.020 --> 50:01.900]  Way to go.
[50:01.900 --> 50:04.840]  So they could have been eating Grape-Nuts in, like, Red Dead Redemption.
[50:05.340 --> 50:06.620]  They probably were, yeah.
[50:07.080 --> 50:08.640]  Wow, you think about that?
[50:08.960 --> 50:11.320]  Tom Cruise could be eating Grape-Nuts in Far and Away.
[50:11.860 --> 50:12.080]  Yeah.
[50:14.180 --> 50:16.720]  Well, that's why I brought up Grape-Nuts, is because that's the whole thing,
[50:16.780 --> 50:20.260]  is he invents Grape-Nuts in Far and Away, and that's how he makes his family fortune.
[50:20.640 --> 50:21.380]  Oh, I see.
[50:23.000 --> 50:24.680]  That makes sense.
[50:24.880 --> 50:27.180]  Okay, you want to... one, two, three, four, five.
[50:27.200 --> 50:28.420]  I have five more rounds if you guys want to go.
[50:28.680 --> 50:29.000]  Please!
[50:29.920 --> 50:32.360]  Rice Krispies or Raisin Bran?
[50:32.940 --> 50:38.600]  Rice Krispies, I feel like, has to be an OG cereal. Really old.
[50:39.320 --> 50:41.500]  Rice Krispies feels like they're trying to make something else,
[50:41.560 --> 50:43.000]  and they accidentally made Rice Krispies.
[50:43.320 --> 50:45.080]  Yeah, but I think that they did that later,
[50:45.160 --> 50:47.780]  because Raisin Bran just seems like a thing that's like,
[50:47.840 --> 50:50.060]  here's Bran, put some milk on it, moron.
[50:50.300 --> 50:50.780]  Exactly.
[50:51.160 --> 50:51.720]  Real easy.
[50:51.880 --> 50:55.200]  So cereal wasn't for kids at the beginning, is that true?
[50:55.800 --> 50:56.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:56.660 --> 50:59.220]  And Rice Krispies are kid-focused.
[50:59.900 --> 51:03.500]  I think that maybe that could be a later marketing thing, though.
[51:04.200 --> 51:07.240]  Oh, you think that Krispies used to be like, accountant food?
[51:07.960 --> 51:11.420]  Based on Grape Nuts, the cereal people aren't fruit people.
[51:12.080 --> 51:15.480]  They're gonna need to have to come up with a deal for the raisins.
[51:16.040 --> 51:17.280]  And that could take time.
[51:17.740 --> 51:18.760]  You got a raisin supplier?
[51:20.280 --> 51:21.480]  That could take years.
[51:21.820 --> 51:22.940]  Was it one of the first collabs?
[51:23.380 --> 51:25.960]  It may have been, based on this.
[51:26.660 --> 51:28.080]  You gotta bring that word into this.
[51:30.040 --> 51:32.900]  Were the California Raisins ever involved with Raisin Bran?
[51:33.460 --> 51:34.420]  Yes, I believe so.
[51:34.820 --> 51:36.380]  Really? Oh, that's perfect.
[51:37.020 --> 51:37.740]  That's a collab.
[51:38.340 --> 51:39.340]  I'm gonna guess Raisin Bran.
[51:39.700 --> 51:41.440]  I'm gonna go Rice Krispies, once again.
[51:41.540 --> 51:45.180]  I think it's cereal that they accidentally made trying to do something else.
[51:45.520 --> 51:46.180]  Eric and Nick?
[51:46.680 --> 51:47.100]  Raisin Bran.
[51:47.440 --> 51:48.880]  Yeah, I'm going Raisin Bran as well.
[51:49.580 --> 51:51.140]  Andrew, you are a fucking savant.
[51:51.260 --> 51:51.700]  Rice Krispies...
[51:52.980 --> 51:57.000]  ...released in 1928, Raisin Bran released in 1942.
[51:57.520 --> 51:57.780]  Wow.
[51:57.820 --> 51:59.580]  Difference is getting that raisin partnership.
[51:59.720 --> 52:00.980]  I'm telling you, it's tough.
[52:01.240 --> 52:01.620]  All right.
[52:02.060 --> 52:03.960]  That's all I can raisin in the past.
[52:04.100 --> 52:04.520]  Terrible, this game.
[52:05.020 --> 52:05.820]  This one's gonna be hard.
[52:05.900 --> 52:09.920]  I tried to make like cereals so that they feel similar between each other.
[52:10.540 --> 52:13.340]  Life cereal versus Cheerios.
[52:14.360 --> 52:16.320]  Oh, Cheerios have been around forever.
[52:16.740 --> 52:18.680]  The base Cheerio, we're not talking Honey Nut.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.180]  We're talking an original base Cheerio, right?
[52:21.180 --> 52:22.460]  What was the other one, Geoff?
[52:23.180 --> 52:23.900]  Life cereal.
[52:24.380 --> 52:27.200]  You think life would be the one because of the name?
[52:27.200 --> 52:28.620]  What the hell is that? Life?
[52:29.000 --> 52:29.320]  It's...
[52:29.320 --> 52:30.100]  Mikey likes it.
[52:30.680 --> 52:33.840]  Life cereal, yeah, was the kid Mikey likes it stuff.
[52:34.060 --> 52:35.200]  It has to be Cheerios.
[52:35.260 --> 52:37.420]  Oh, it's like a... what is that like?
[52:37.700 --> 52:39.280]  It's got a green bird on it, right?
[52:39.960 --> 52:40.240]  Life?
[52:40.240 --> 52:40.360]  What?
[52:41.140 --> 52:43.320]  Life cereal? Isn't that the green bird cereal?
[52:43.520 --> 52:44.180]  It has a green bird?
[52:44.560 --> 52:45.000]  What?
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.800]  Let me... let me look up life cereal.
[52:48.380 --> 52:48.440]  What?
[52:49.420 --> 52:50.320]  Don't look it up.
[52:50.320 --> 52:51.680]  It's going to spoil it, right?
[52:51.780 --> 52:53.180]  No, I'm just googling the box.
[52:53.720 --> 52:54.900]  Life cereal box.
[52:55.500 --> 52:55.700]  Googling the box.
[52:56.520 --> 52:57.480]  Established 1923.
[52:57.660 --> 52:58.940]  I just don't... what bird?
[52:59.920 --> 53:00.940]  There... I'm telling...
[53:00.940 --> 53:03.200]  Okay, I'm going life cereal box Canada.
[53:03.380 --> 53:04.900]  I don't see a bird.
[53:05.580 --> 53:07.680]  No, it's just like the Quaker man in the background.
[53:07.700 --> 53:08.580]  It's just a kid, right?
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.100]  There is a... oh, fuck.
[53:11.140 --> 53:11.960]  Who is this bird?
[53:12.060 --> 53:12.920]  It's a green bird.
[53:13.300 --> 53:14.620]  It's the color of life.
[53:17.140 --> 53:18.660]  Life cereal box.
[53:18.840 --> 53:19.800]  What color is that?
[53:19.800 --> 53:20.120]  Bird.
[53:20.960 --> 53:24.580]  It's like blue and white or blue and red and yellow and green.
[53:25.260 --> 53:26.760]  You're talking about Toucan Sam?
[53:27.000 --> 53:27.300]  No, I'm not.
[53:27.400 --> 53:28.560]  I know Toucan Sam.
[53:28.720 --> 53:29.880]  I can identify Toucan Sam.
[53:29.880 --> 53:31.760]  If you say so, you don't know the life cereal bird.
[53:31.940 --> 53:32.480]  Oh, I found it.
[53:32.600 --> 53:34.420]  Oh, it's the cornflakes bird.
[53:35.160 --> 53:39.500]  I got the cornflakes bird mixed up with the light bird because it's very similar colors.
[53:39.820 --> 53:40.040]  It's a cornflakes bird?
[53:40.640 --> 53:40.860]  Yeah.
[53:41.140 --> 53:42.420]  He's a little green rooster.
[53:42.920 --> 53:43.140]  Yeah.
[53:43.240 --> 53:43.980]  That's... yeah.
[53:44.660 --> 53:46.080]  That's the bird I was thinking.
[53:46.320 --> 53:46.960]  Oh, that bird.
[53:47.260 --> 53:48.280]  Yeah, it's not a life bird.
[53:48.300 --> 53:49.360]  It's a cornflake bird.
[53:49.360 --> 53:51.140]  I'm going to say Cheerios.
[53:51.480 --> 53:52.900]  I'm also going to say Cheerios.
[53:53.740 --> 53:54.140]  Cheerios!
[53:54.420 --> 53:55.100]  I'll say life.
[53:55.620 --> 53:57.260]  OK, it was Cheerios.
[53:58.260 --> 53:58.660]  1945.
[53:59.420 --> 54:00.800]  Life came out in 1961.
[54:01.720 --> 54:02.120]  1945?
[54:03.340 --> 54:05.320]  That's so late for Cheerios.
[54:05.380 --> 54:06.320]  Yeah, I know, right?
[54:06.480 --> 54:07.440]  Cheerios is more recent.
[54:07.600 --> 54:09.600]  Cheerios is a 1700s food.
[54:09.760 --> 54:12.540]  How did they wait all that long to make it?
[54:12.540 --> 54:13.440]  It took them a long time.
[54:13.480 --> 54:15.460]  It took them a long time to develop O technology.
[54:15.900 --> 54:16.280]  Wow.
[54:16.640 --> 54:17.220]  All right.
[54:17.300 --> 54:18.920]  This one's going to be a little bit harder, I think.
[54:19.480 --> 54:19.920]  Hopefully.
[54:20.320 --> 54:21.740]  Two of my favorite cereals, by the way.
[54:22.100 --> 54:24.760]  Fruity Pebbles versus Captain Crunch.
[54:25.060 --> 54:27.680]  Oh, that is tough because I feel like they're the same era.
[54:29.220 --> 54:32.420]  I feel like Fruity Pebbles...
[54:32.420 --> 54:33.220]  I've never had either of these.
[54:33.220 --> 54:35.700]  OK, I feel like it's got...
[54:35.700 --> 54:39.960]  I feel like it's Captain Crunch because fruit cereal...
[54:40.520 --> 54:44.340]  Fruit is too exotic for early years of cereal.
[54:44.600 --> 54:46.120]  We don't have fruit in stuff.
[54:46.300 --> 54:48.360]  Fruit at that time was like, eat a grapefruit.
[54:48.360 --> 54:50.100]  It's the sweetest thing you've ever tasted.
[54:50.420 --> 54:53.440]  So I think it's got to be Captain Crunch.
[54:54.080 --> 54:57.040]  The thing for me, bringing this down in my head, I'm thinking about
[54:57.040 --> 55:00.760]  Hanna-Barbera and I feel like the Flintstones are tied to Fruity Pebbles.
[55:01.860 --> 55:08.160]  But I feel like Captain Crunch feels like some old timey kids like boats type thinking.
[55:08.980 --> 55:11.200]  Like kids are into captains.
[55:11.660 --> 55:12.280]  There's like...
[55:12.280 --> 55:15.820]  Captain Crunch has gone through a lot of different looks.
[55:15.820 --> 55:18.840]  He looked like fucked up crazy mode at the beginning.
[55:19.320 --> 55:21.900]  Did he come up through the ranks or was he captain from the start?
[55:21.900 --> 55:25.680]  No, unfortunately, he's just sort of like he's hit his career progression ceiling
[55:25.680 --> 55:27.720]  and he was a captain and always has been a captain.
[55:28.260 --> 55:28.700]  Sad.
[55:29.480 --> 55:31.860]  I used to know a lot about Captain Crunch, but I don't remember.
[55:33.160 --> 55:34.760]  There's a lot of Captain Crunch lore.
[55:34.880 --> 55:37.680]  He used to know a lot about Captain Crunch.
[55:37.880 --> 55:41.440]  These are questions I had in the past, but whatever the info was,
[55:41.740 --> 55:44.600]  outside of knowing I knew it, I don't remember the specifics.
[55:46.660 --> 55:47.910]  Uh, I'm going to go...
[55:49.340 --> 55:50.700]  I'm going to go Captain Crunch.
[55:51.100 --> 55:52.320]  I think Captain Crunch is older.
[55:53.940 --> 55:55.380]  Everybody else, what do you...
[55:55.380 --> 55:56.660]  Eric, that sounds like you're Captain Crunch.
[55:56.680 --> 55:57.640]  Captain Crunch, yeah, definitely.
[55:58.040 --> 55:59.460]  Gavin, you've never heard of either.
[55:59.740 --> 56:00.440]  I'll go the other one.
[56:00.960 --> 56:01.660]  Okay, fruity Pebbles.
[56:02.320 --> 56:04.920]  Fruity Pebbles launched it...
[56:04.920 --> 56:09.120]  Fruity Pebbles yabba-dabba did it in 1969.
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.300]  Uh-huh.
[56:10.980 --> 56:16.460]  Whereas Captain Crunch's first set sail on the cereal seas in 1963.
[56:17.340 --> 56:17.860]  Hey!
[56:18.380 --> 56:18.460]  Yeah!
[56:19.240 --> 56:20.520]  We avoided the iceberg!
[56:21.280 --> 56:21.920]  Hell yeah!
[56:22.500 --> 56:22.760]  Yep.
[56:23.180 --> 56:25.020]  This one is going to be hard.
[56:25.340 --> 56:26.200]  I think.
[56:26.260 --> 56:26.440]  Okay.
[56:27.700 --> 56:30.260]  Honeycomb versus Golden Grahams.
[56:30.580 --> 56:30.880]  Ooh.
[56:32.180 --> 56:33.020]  That is hard.
[56:33.240 --> 56:34.320]  That's a tough one.
[56:36.320 --> 56:38.140]  Are Golden Grahams the bear one?
[56:38.420 --> 56:38.800]  Yeah.
[56:39.400 --> 56:39.800]  No?
[56:40.900 --> 56:41.300]  No?
[56:41.720 --> 56:42.180]  I'm getting...
[56:42.180 --> 56:43.360]  That's Super Golden Crisp.
[56:43.640 --> 56:45.380]  Can't get enough of Super Golden Crisp.
[56:45.740 --> 56:45.980]  Yeah.
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.040]  Isn't it a bear in a red shirt?
[56:51.820 --> 56:52.200]  Blue pants?
[56:52.220 --> 56:53.040]  Oh, maybe it is.
[56:53.160 --> 56:53.640]  Maybe it is.
[56:55.860 --> 56:56.700]  I'm looking it up.
[56:56.940 --> 56:59.640]  Geoff's just fighting all the way to be wrong.
[56:59.740 --> 57:00.120]  It's great.
[57:00.460 --> 57:01.700]  No, no, it's just...
[57:01.700 --> 57:02.000]  It's...
[57:02.000 --> 57:02.740]  Yeah, it's just this.
[57:03.200 --> 57:03.800]  Geoff, look...
[57:03.800 --> 57:05.320]  Gavin, look at old Captain Crunch.
[57:05.360 --> 57:05.900]  Look at that guy.
[57:06.780 --> 57:08.120]  He's fucking cracked out.
[57:09.940 --> 57:10.420]  I...
[57:10.420 --> 57:11.800]  I think...
[57:11.800 --> 57:12.300]  Man.
[57:12.820 --> 57:20.520]  I want to say it's Golden Grahams because the shape of Honeycrisp or whatever is too
[57:21.220 --> 57:23.940]  technologically advanced to be...
[57:23.940 --> 57:25.940]  Can I see the Honeycrisp box, Geoff, as well, please?
[57:26.020 --> 57:26.800]  Just so I can...
[57:26.800 --> 57:27.200]  Oh, Honeycomb?
[57:27.220 --> 57:28.080]  I don't think I've seen...
[57:28.080 --> 57:28.740]  Yeah, Honeycomb.
[57:29.700 --> 57:31.460]  I haven't had either of these cereals.
[57:31.920 --> 57:32.080]  Okay.
[57:32.840 --> 57:34.340]  Honeycomb just sounds like half a name.
[57:36.040 --> 57:36.760]  Honeycomb what?
[57:37.420 --> 57:37.900]  Honeycomb!
[57:38.100 --> 57:38.480]  Honeycomb.
[57:38.800 --> 57:39.700]  I got it.
[57:39.760 --> 57:40.780]  I got it.
[57:40.800 --> 57:41.160]  I got it.
[57:41.240 --> 57:41.580]  I got it.
[57:41.580 --> 57:41.900]  It's all right.
[57:41.900 --> 57:42.180]  Okay.
[57:42.420 --> 57:42.800]  Okay.
[57:42.900 --> 57:43.900]  Both wits the same one.
[57:44.400 --> 57:44.920]  Honeycomb.
[57:45.940 --> 57:47.260]  Big real honey.
[57:48.360 --> 57:49.080]  Yeah, I think...
[57:49.880 --> 57:50.960]  I think it's...
[57:50.960 --> 57:52.160]  I think it's Golden Grahams.
[57:52.260 --> 57:52.580]  I think...
[57:53.120 --> 57:53.920]  I think the...
[57:54.660 --> 57:55.080]  This...
[57:55.080 --> 57:57.340]  The look is too impressive of the Honeycomb.
[57:57.780 --> 57:59.520]  It is impressive.
[57:59.800 --> 58:00.200]  I do...
[58:01.040 --> 58:01.960]  I do...
[58:01.960 --> 58:02.620]  Here's the thing.
[58:02.820 --> 58:04.140]  Big real honey flavor.
[58:04.880 --> 58:05.200]  Yeah.
[58:06.380 --> 58:10.800]  Because I agree, the design of the Honeycomb implies to me that it is much more modern.
[58:11.240 --> 58:12.930]  However, the...
[58:14.220 --> 58:15.060]  Uh, the...
[58:15.060 --> 58:16.680]  The, like, flavoring material.
[58:16.900 --> 58:20.220]  It feels like they just coated Golden Grahams and stuff.
[58:20.740 --> 58:23.560]  I'm gonna have to go with Honeycomb just because it's such a shit name.
[58:24.080 --> 58:24.320]  Yeah.
[58:24.740 --> 58:25.920]  It sounds basic.
[58:26.080 --> 58:28.340]  It sounds like it could have been cereal number three or something.
[58:28.600 --> 58:29.440]  Now, here's the thing.
[58:29.640 --> 58:32.300]  I hate that you've done this because you've been wrong every time.
[58:32.300 --> 58:34.240]  And I was leaning around for five.
[58:35.280 --> 58:36.600]  You've been wrong every time.
[58:36.720 --> 58:38.800]  And that really makes me want to go Golden Grahams.
[58:39.160 --> 58:42.000]  But my heart is pulling towards Honeycomb.
[58:42.400 --> 58:43.220]  I think Honeycomb.
[58:44.240 --> 58:45.500]  You're gonna come to the wrong side?
[58:46.660 --> 58:48.320]  Were there ever just Grahams?
[58:49.280 --> 58:52.200]  Is Golden Grahams a Honey Nut Cheerios situation?
[58:52.440 --> 58:52.920]  Were there just Grahams?
[58:52.920 --> 58:53.660]  No, not to them.
[58:53.740 --> 58:54.380]  I don't think so.
[58:54.560 --> 58:54.940]  I don't think so.
[58:55.040 --> 58:56.460]  So Grahams came in gold?
[58:57.160 --> 58:58.300]  He started gold.
[58:58.480 --> 58:58.640]  Yeah.
[58:58.820 --> 59:00.020]  Much like Captain Crunch.
[59:00.560 --> 59:01.680]  He was the captain from the start.
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.040]  Grahams were always gold.
[59:04.240 --> 59:07.360]  He was just already a captain when he entered the cereal business.
[59:07.740 --> 59:07.880]  Right.
[59:07.980 --> 59:09.400]  Big, real honey flavor.
[59:09.800 --> 59:11.160]  All that Grahams is gold.
[59:12.760 --> 59:13.240]  Yeah.
[59:15.520 --> 59:16.000]  Honeycomb.
[59:16.280 --> 59:16.780]  Golden Graham.
[59:17.100 --> 59:18.600]  I'm going to say Honeycomb is older.
[59:18.800 --> 59:19.280]  Golden Graham.
[59:19.640 --> 59:20.120]  Honeycomb.
[59:20.180 --> 59:21.360]  I'm going Golden Grahams.
[59:21.960 --> 59:23.480]  All right. So, Eric, you said Golden Graham.
[59:23.540 --> 59:24.260]  What did you say, Andrew?
[59:24.640 --> 59:25.440]  I went Honeycomb.
[59:25.860 --> 59:26.120]  Okay.
[59:26.240 --> 59:27.940]  Gavin, you said Honeycomb.
[59:28.340 --> 59:28.540]  Nick?
[59:29.420 --> 59:37.780]  Golden Grahams first released in 1976 versus Honeycomb, which first released in 1965.
[59:38.300 --> 59:38.700]  Wow.
[59:39.220 --> 59:39.780]  Wow.
[59:40.200 --> 59:41.220]  That's crazy.
[59:41.320 --> 59:42.540]  Good call, Gavin.
[59:42.740 --> 59:46.600]  The thought process there was fantastic to listen to.
[59:46.700 --> 59:46.940]  Damn.
[59:47.300 --> 59:48.420]  That was great. That was a great one.
[59:48.520 --> 59:48.860]  Wow.
[59:49.140 --> 59:53.300]  Okay. This last one, I just threw it in as a fun one.
[59:53.780 --> 59:55.100]  These two aren't really related in any way.
[59:55.860 --> 59:59.100]  Count Chocula versus Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.880]  Oh, Count Chocula.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.500]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.940]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is still in the naming scheme of like, here's what you're going to eat.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:10.800]  Yeah.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.000]  Whereas Count Chocula, you're just like, what?
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.100]  Yeah, but it seems so...
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.700]  I'm trying to think of like the oldest look for both of them that I can remember.
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:27.900]  I'm a big fan of some of the variation of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:28.960]  What did I do?
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.040]  You made me laugh. You're funny.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:31.800]  Oh. Oh, sorry.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.940]  Do I have to fillet you in front of everybody right now?
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.840]  No, it's just such a delay. I couldn't remember what I said.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:40.120]  I'm trying to think of like...
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:45.940]  I think it's got to be Count Chocula because I remember some really shitty like 50s, 60s
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:52.940]  like look to him and Cinnamon Toast Crunch feels very 80s to me.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.420]  And they had like different mascots.
[01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:58.160]  Also, Count Chocula went away and came back.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160]  Oh, that's true.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.780]  I don't know if he ever went away. I think Frankenberry and Boo-Berry might have gone
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.460]  away. But I don't know if Count Chocula, I think he's been pretty consistent.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.120]  I think he dropped for a bit.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.720]  What about the Werewolf?
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.600]  Maybe. Oh, he was Strawberry?
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:15.680]  Something like that.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.420]  Wolfy O's.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.040]  Cummy Mummy? What was the other one?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.320]  Fruit Brute was the...
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.680]  Fruit Brute.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.140]  Yeah, that was the name of the wolf.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.260]  I got to go with Count Chocula.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:40.880]  Hearing Cummy Mummy while seeing cereal boxes that are just loads of milk on the box really...
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.120]  Yeah, loads. Yeah, loads.
[01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:42.880]  Brings it all together.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:43.960]  Loads and loads.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.040]  Fucking loads of milk.
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:48.440]  So again, Eric is locked in on Count Chocula.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.020]  Fucking Fruity Cummy Mummy, dude. Gross.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.720]  Did you say you were Count Chocula as well?
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:55.200]  Okay.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:55.800]  Yeah, Count Chocula.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.260]  So just Gavin and Andrew.
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.300]  I'm still thinking.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.140]  Okay.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.400]  Because vampires are older than toast.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:03.820]  But...
[01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.180]  Is that true?
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.040]  Yeah, but not by much. Not by much.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.360]  Someone must have lost their house in a fire and they got some bread out.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.520]  That's how toast was invented.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.820]  It was a house fire and...
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.860]  My house burned down and it smells fabulous.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.140]  I feel like toast could definitely happen by accident.
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:23.700]  But on the upside...
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:29.860]  All of the side products of bread are just from people leaving it out
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.180]  or accidentally burning their house down like it's all accidental.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.000]  I think Count Chocula is a 70s thing.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.020]  So is it prior to Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:44.420]  When it comes to the Cinnamon Toast Crunch realm,
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:49.000]  I'm a big fan of the churro variation, a more modern twist on it.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.000]  It's pretty great.
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.720]  French toast too.
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:54.080]  Oh, man.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.640]  I don't like either of these cereals.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.960]  When did toasters exist?
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:04.380]  Toasters have existed since the 1800s, I think. Since electricity.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.820]  I feel like if you were...
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:12.380]  Much like the High Five, if you told me that toasters were made in like the 60s,
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:14.260]  that wouldn't have necessarily shocked me.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.520]  But you could do embers for toast, right?
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Yeah, you could toast it in an oven, couldn't you?
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.280]  Yeah, you could burn your house down and get some toast, yeah.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.260]  Yeah, you really could have fucking burned your house down with one of these back in the day.
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.180]  Oh, that's what an old toaster looked like?
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.680]  That's from like 1897.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:34.320]  Is that how they killed Christ?
[01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.220]  So you plug your toaster, which is open, into a lamp.
[01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:46.820]  That's brilliant. I want one of those.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.040]  Looks like a Scientology device to like test your Q rating or whatever the fuck.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.060]  All right, Andrew.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.440]  I got on toaster TikTok for a while and they're interesting.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.740]  I'm going to say that Count Chocula is older.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:09.020]  OK. Count Chocula came out in 1971. Cinnamon Toast Crunch released in 1984.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:10.100]  Wow!
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.120]  You were six for six.
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.960]  That was phenomenal, man.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.340]  Incredible.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.000]  I can't believe this. I'm not a cereal guy.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:23.800]  You did a tremendous, that was, that was, that was unbelievably impressive.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:25.220]  I'm crediting Blueprints.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.020]  I've been in a real try to solve puzzles, getting to the bottom of things recently.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:29.820]  Dominant, dominant performance.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.980]  That was a definite Blueprints run for sure.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.300]  That was a great game, Geoff.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.480]  Thank you for putting that together.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:36.520]  Yeah, no worries.
[01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:39.380]  I think I've had a cereal revelation during that.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:40.140]  Really?
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.180]  I stopped eating cereal a few years ago.
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:47.300]  And I also was thinking, I haven't gleaked in about two or three years.
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.400]  Oh, Gleek!
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.920]  Like, does gleeking go away with age or is it just like the food you eat?
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.180]  I don't know. Try it now.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.480]  What?
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.420]  I've never been able to do it on demand.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.260]  Oh, it's like an accidental thing for you?
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:58.760]  Yeah.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.740]  Can you just gleek?
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.880]  No, not on accident. That's embarrassing.
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.860]  I don't even know what gleeking is. What's gleeking?
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:10.300]  It's when your saliva gland just like fires out in a jet.
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.880]  Like if you were a snake.
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.900]  Like when you go full snake venom mode.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:17.780]  Have you ever done it?
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.740]  No, I don't. I don't think so.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.620]  You'd be like moving your tongue and then you just go...
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:25.420]  Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.620]  It's the fucking roses thing.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.980]  Oh, it comes out of the bottom?
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:29.400]  From your gleek hole?
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.080]  Yep.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.680]  Wait, the gleek hole is under the tongue?
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:34.340]  Yes.
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.600]  I've got to film this. Can anyone do it? Can we slow-mo this?
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.700]  Absolutely not.
[01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.700]  I can't do it.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.900]  I've never been able to do it.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:45.740]  Never.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.060]  Oh, I can't believe it's from right in the middle. It's like a little...
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.700]  That's blowing my mind. I thought it was like at the back of the throat.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.340]  Gleek hole.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.740]  I was going to say something and that has completely emptied my brain.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.860]  That's... I'm in shock.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.420]  I can't believe that.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.920]  It does look like a snake.
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:19.200]  I used to gleek way more as a kid. I gleeked on someone's face once.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:19.740]  I felt real bad.
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:20.100]  What?
[01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.520]  At the dinner, at the school lunch.
[01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.520]  There was a facial gleeking by you?
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:29.220]  Yeah.
[01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.820]  No wonder you're at the bottom of the pile.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.280]  I gleeked on my friend Ian's glasses.
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.040]  Oh my god.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:40.260]  No wonder he looked up.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.660]  Oh, I got that, Nick.
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:48.480]  Oh, gleeking.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.480]  Yeah, maybe if I get some cereal going, it'll start happening again.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.640]  Was Ian mad at you?
[01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.220]  No, he found it really funny.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:55.980]  Good.
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.960]  Oh, okay. You got a real one there.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:58.860]  You do.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:06.240]  I feel like it's not gleeking, but now that I'm on CPAP, if I open my mouth up,
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.860]  I feel like I'm a battle cat. I feel like I'm hissing.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.080]  He's a good.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.760]  Gavin just gleeked.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.880]  I was trying to squash my tongue like she's doing that, and it worked.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.080]  Ian's going to be so jealous.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:38.680]  Well, at least you know you can do it.
[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.220]  And that it's not related to cereal.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.560]  Now I know that it's like a tiny little tongue urethra. It's blown my mind.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.060]  That's been there the whole time.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.620]  Yeah, the whole time.
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:00.360]  Seriously, just do what she's doing there and just kind of like.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.140]  I'm trying. I'm just trying right now.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.260]  No, I'm gleek-less.
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:17.880]  Maybe we'll spend the next week or so practicing and then we could do Gleek Olympics.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.340]  Well, it might be everyone getting bronze, but you, by the sounds of it.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.560]  Yeah, Gavin, you want to gleek us out of here?
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.040]  Oh, stop.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.140]  Oh, no, no, I heard that.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:38.740]  Disgusting.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.140]  We need to leave.
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:47.180]  Oh, my God. Hey, this has been the 52nd episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.900]  Man, where does the time go? I'll tell you where it goes.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.260]  It goes in the dump because we live in the future, which is the present.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.000]  Wait, what?
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.400]  Time machines!
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.520]  We'll see you next time.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.900]  Thanks for supporting us for one whole year.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.560]  Please continue to do so.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.500]  We'll see you on Sunday at 11 a.m.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.740]  Is your heated money finished?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.560]  I was going to say, because next time is Sunday at 11 a.m.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.460]  when we stream Mario Party all together for fun for our one year anniversary.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:26.160]  And then at 12 noon, we'll all buy stuff on our store because it comes out at that time.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.120]  And then we'll continue to play Mario Party and enjoy each other's company.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.560]  And we'll see you then.
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:34.840]  If I keep this up, I'm going to be the only person buying Idiot Flex.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.680]  I need to really pull it back next episode.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.220]  Are we doing that new level you unlocked?
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.140]  We could.
[01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:42.200]  We could do the Bowser level.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.840]  Yeah, people really wanted us to do that.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.480]  30 turn Bowser.
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:46.540]  Can't wait.
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:47.280]  See you on Sunday.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:48.100]  Bye.
