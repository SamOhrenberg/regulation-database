[00:00.000 --> 00:03.340]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.780 --> 00:09.160]  This is season two. Episode 53 is the first episode of season two.
[00:09.620 --> 00:12.740]  Congratulations, Eric, Nick, Gavin and Andrew.
[00:12.820 --> 00:14.220]  And I guess to myself, Geoff, as well.
[00:14.480 --> 00:17.060]  We didn't shit the bed in the first year.
[00:17.280 --> 00:20.840]  Most businesses completely flush themselves down the toilet in the first year,
[00:20.940 --> 00:22.520]  but we're still floating around.
[00:22.720 --> 00:24.380]  You shit your pants, but not the bed.
[00:24.620 --> 00:27.780]  Thank you so much to the audience for supporting us and allowing us to not
[00:28.620 --> 00:31.020]  flush down the toilet and fail immediately.
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.480]  Abso-fucking-lutely.
[00:32.700 --> 00:34.060]  We couldn't have done it without them.
[00:34.420 --> 00:36.140]  The audience keeps our bedsheets clean.
[00:36.580 --> 00:38.820]  The audience keeps us afloat, like quite literally.
[00:39.200 --> 00:44.140]  They fill our toilet reservoir a hell of a lot faster than the one in our office does.
[00:44.500 --> 00:45.660]  Yeah, that's definitely true.
[00:46.160 --> 00:48.800]  I was going to say my dump room, but I guess it's still part of our office.
[00:49.300 --> 00:50.460]  It's your dump room, though.
[00:50.980 --> 00:52.020]  The office dumper?
[00:52.760 --> 00:55.140]  Well, they designated a bathroom just for me.
[00:55.640 --> 00:57.000]  Oh, you have your own shitter.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.920]  Yeah, I was very kind about it.
[01:00.140 --> 01:00.860]  Oh, that's great.
[01:01.340 --> 01:03.140]  Yeah, that's fancy.
[01:03.520 --> 01:05.740]  How's everybody doing living in a season two world?
[01:06.240 --> 01:07.320]  I feel so good.
[01:07.400 --> 01:11.440]  I feel twice as good as I did last time we did this.
[01:12.780 --> 01:13.760]  Double good.
[01:16.100 --> 01:17.760]  Man, I can't wait till season ten.
[01:18.520 --> 01:22.680]  I went to open my notes, but it just opened my worm names of the video.
[01:22.780 --> 01:23.900]  You just blindsided away.
[01:23.900 --> 01:27.380]  I mean, I can't wait to play more worms, though.
[01:28.080 --> 01:30.500]  Whatever. We spent like one hundred and twenty dollars.
[01:30.660 --> 01:31.220]  You're ridiculous.
[01:32.060 --> 01:35.920]  I like that he blindsided us on a game of worms that we all had to pay for.
[01:36.180 --> 01:39.020]  Yeah, we're still going to make the video.
[01:39.460 --> 01:40.900]  Yeah. You say so.
[01:40.980 --> 01:41.900]  Doesn't change anything.
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.500]  Speaking of notes, actually, I have a note and maybe you can help me with this.
[01:47.680 --> 01:50.120]  Geoff, it just says summer movie auction debacle.
[01:50.600 --> 01:52.160]  Oh, I have a note in my.
[01:52.160 --> 01:54.840]  Let me see. It says this is coming up tomorrow.
[01:55.180 --> 01:57.320]  So let's put those two notes together.
[01:58.320 --> 02:00.300]  I think debacle is a strong word.
[02:00.360 --> 02:01.240]  I said it at the time.
[02:01.340 --> 02:04.300]  I'm going to stand by the fact that debacle is strong.
[02:04.540 --> 02:06.300]  Well, you're going to you're going to love this.
[02:06.460 --> 02:11.240]  So yesterday we did a Falcon event where we watched movie trailers
[02:11.240 --> 02:16.580]  of all of the movies that we incorporated into the summer movie draft.
[02:16.920 --> 02:18.560]  Right. Which was a great event.
[02:18.700 --> 02:20.680]  We basically watched them in the order we drafted.
[02:20.680 --> 02:22.660]  And so I hadn't seen most of the trailers.
[02:22.800 --> 02:24.860]  It was cool to hang out and shoot the shit with the Falcons.
[02:25.160 --> 02:28.760]  And things went awry really quickly, though, because we got to clown
[02:28.760 --> 02:30.800]  in a cornfield, which is my movie.
[02:31.080 --> 02:32.620]  And Andrew said, that's not your movie.
[02:33.040 --> 02:33.740]  That's my movie.
[02:33.860 --> 02:37.920]  And I said, no, I even went back and watched the video
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.500]  that we created last week just to make sure it was my movie,
[02:41.540 --> 02:44.620]  because I was a little confused based on some of your public comments
[02:44.620 --> 02:45.920]  seeming to think that you have the movie.
[02:46.940 --> 02:49.380]  And and Andrew goes, I'm pretty sure it's my movie.
[02:49.380 --> 02:51.820]  And I go, I watched the video and I'm looking and Eric goes,
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.320]  I'm looking at the sheet and it says it's Geoff's movie.
[02:54.460 --> 02:56.080]  And Andrew goes, don't look at the sheet.
[02:56.260 --> 02:57.060]  The sheet is wrong.
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.540]  What? Wait, what?
[02:58.900 --> 03:02.000]  No, that's not that's not exactly how things lined up.
[03:02.240 --> 03:04.460]  Yeah. So there was a so there was another one.
[03:05.160 --> 03:06.860]  Fighter Flight came up.
[03:07.180 --> 03:07.960]  We were watching the trailer.
[03:08.140 --> 03:10.360]  Fighter Flight said, whose movie is this?
[03:10.360 --> 03:11.160]  And I said, Gavin.
[03:11.300 --> 03:12.780]  And Andrew said, no, this is mine.
[03:12.840 --> 03:16.120]  And I said, I'm looking at the sheet and it says Gavin.
[03:16.520 --> 03:18.080]  And then as I'm looking at the sheet,
[03:18.080 --> 03:23.480]  it changed to an editable document to a view only mode.
[03:23.720 --> 03:27.720]  And then Fighter Flight quickly changed from Gavin to Andrew.
[03:28.060 --> 03:32.280]  So let me address both these things, because these are two separate issues.
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.080]  The clown in a cornfield thing unrelated to the document issue.
[03:37.200 --> 03:39.020]  That's just me remembering wrong.
[03:39.280 --> 03:44.320]  I thought for some reason for sure that I owned it just based off of memory.
[03:44.520 --> 03:46.620]  You spent a whole Worms game promoting it,
[03:46.940 --> 03:48.320]  which I really appreciate, by the way.
[03:48.500 --> 03:49.380]  That's exactly.
[03:49.640 --> 03:52.480]  And that happened before the video even came out.
[03:52.520 --> 03:57.580]  So it like shows that I just completely misremembered how that went in the draft.
[03:57.900 --> 04:02.640]  Now, what happened with the document that caused the Fighter Flight issue is,
[04:02.740 --> 04:06.600]  as you may remember, it was a whole thing where it wasn't working on my computer,
[04:06.720 --> 04:07.520]  the initial one.
[04:07.900 --> 04:09.380]  And so I had to make a new one.
[04:09.420 --> 04:12.760]  And then I sent it to Eric and then he couldn't edit it.
[04:12.760 --> 04:13.980]  And it was a whole panic thing.
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.260]  So I just made it public.
[04:15.260 --> 04:20.300]  And the video came out and people found it because it was public.
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.560]  And then as a joke, swapped a bunch of the movies to being owned by Gavin.
[04:25.120 --> 04:27.380]  Why why do you make documents public?
[04:27.920 --> 04:29.820]  I just explain why I did it.
[04:29.820 --> 04:33.360]  And that instance of it was a moment of panic while we were recording
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.760]  and trying to get Eric access to it as immediately as possible.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.840]  I completely agree.
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.300]  Not the best way to do it, but it was a panic move.
[04:43.300 --> 04:47.900]  Please, audience, stop finding, stop looking for the documents and finding them.
[04:48.040 --> 04:50.680]  Andrew is incapable of not making them public.
[04:51.240 --> 04:54.540]  Loves putting them on the Internet for the whole world to see.
[04:54.660 --> 04:57.500]  I love people to see the stuff that we do.
[04:57.880 --> 04:59.060]  Yeah, it's called view only.
[04:59.600 --> 05:01.940]  It's called view only mode for the for the public.
[05:02.180 --> 05:03.640]  You know what? That's a great point.
[05:04.160 --> 05:06.600]  I'm not trying to argue that I did anything right here.
[05:06.620 --> 05:08.500]  I'm just explaining why it went wrong.
[05:08.720 --> 05:10.340]  I was it was definitely in the wrong.
[05:10.640 --> 05:12.300]  It's the whole you being in charge of stuff.
[05:12.300 --> 05:15.540]  Yeah. Well, if you want to take charge of it, Gavin, you're more than welcome to.
[05:15.640 --> 05:16.460]  You know, you go ahead.
[05:17.260 --> 05:18.300]  Oh, happy to.
[05:19.020 --> 05:19.940]  Oh, sweet.
[05:20.940 --> 05:21.740]  Sweet. Awesome.
[05:22.260 --> 05:22.940]  I'll do it next year.
[05:24.800 --> 05:25.600]  Next year?
[05:26.940 --> 05:28.800]  Well, he needs to feel three times as good.
[05:29.080 --> 05:30.220]  Well, we did the movie auction already.
[05:30.420 --> 05:30.920]  We'll do it again.
[05:31.600 --> 05:32.460]  What do you mean?
[05:34.180 --> 05:34.580]  What?
[05:35.960 --> 05:39.580]  I was referencing all of the stuff relating to it,
[05:39.580 --> 05:44.220]  which includes sending out all of the let's plays to editors and scheduling
[05:44.220 --> 05:46.340]  and making sure it goes up on time.
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.940]  And you're just saying, do your entire job.
[05:49.240 --> 05:54.140]  Now, I'm saying that if you wanted, if you think you can do it so much better.
[05:54.300 --> 05:55.440]  I don't even know what I was saying.
[05:55.700 --> 05:58.520]  I was I'm saying that I was in the wrong in this.
[05:58.560 --> 05:59.180]  I don't understand.
[06:01.200 --> 06:03.360]  I don't know why you're still attacking me.
[06:03.400 --> 06:05.160]  I'm saying I fucked up. I was wrong.
[06:05.500 --> 06:08.000]  Yeah, you can really kick him while he's down, Andrew or Gavin.
[06:08.000 --> 06:09.720]  Yeah. What are you doing? Attacking him?
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.900]  I thought you were on his side the way he's on your side.
[06:11.940 --> 06:13.340]  I am on Gavin's side.
[06:13.360 --> 06:17.000]  He spent a whole episode defending you from the Australians like two weeks ago.
[06:17.000 --> 06:19.140]  Good point. Yeah, that came out.
[06:19.540 --> 06:21.980]  It did. My point.
[06:22.120 --> 06:26.040]  OK, let me because I came at you aggressively as a friend.
[06:26.120 --> 06:27.160]  I was shit talking you.
[06:27.620 --> 06:29.000]  But the heart of my sentiment
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.280]  was on your side and my ass.
[06:34.020 --> 06:34.880]  Let me explain.
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.040]  There are people that are saying
[06:37.040 --> 06:40.660]  that's a great segment for the Australia Morning News, in which I agree.
[06:40.840 --> 06:42.560]  That was totally fine.
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.820]  That's a great talk show moment thing.
[06:45.960 --> 06:48.900]  You're saying you totally agree and it's totally fine.
[06:49.240 --> 06:51.580]  I'm saying from their perspective, it is.
[06:52.080 --> 06:57.240]  What I poorly communicated was I think that you are so incredibly talented
[06:57.240 --> 06:59.020]  and have so much else going on.
[06:59.360 --> 07:04.360]  I don't know how that values you to go on there and explain why you did this thing.
[07:04.880 --> 07:06.800]  Like, I don't know what you get out of it.
[07:07.060 --> 07:11.540]  As somebody who is happy to do it, busy and like talks about,
[07:11.620 --> 07:14.540]  you know, the importance of their like not wanting to waste time.
[07:14.680 --> 07:17.640]  That was what I was trying to advocate is that I feel you're above
[07:17.640 --> 07:18.940]  what that interview was.
[07:19.320 --> 07:19.940]  Oh, I disagree.
[07:20.100 --> 07:25.660]  I think it's not often you get asked to be on a different country's morning TV show.
[07:26.040 --> 07:27.000]  That's totally true.
[07:27.260 --> 07:30.280]  And that is something that I will, I don't think, ever experience.
[07:30.480 --> 07:33.840]  I'm not claiming that I deserve to be or that like I could ever.
[07:33.840 --> 07:36.260]  I hope to God you do, though.
[07:36.340 --> 07:38.020]  Yeah, I mean, it would be a disaster.
[07:38.380 --> 07:39.260]  It would be horrendous.
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.040]  I really want to make that happen.
[07:41.500 --> 07:45.100]  I just feel like I've heard from podcasts and I feel like even you
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.960]  and Bernie talked about it in the Rooster Teeth podcast
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.080]  that there is like a zero percent conversion rate
[07:50.080 --> 07:54.300]  from people seeing something on TV to then engaging with it online.
[07:54.520 --> 07:56.580]  That's true. That's 100% true.
[07:56.920 --> 07:57.680]  Yeah. Yeah.
[07:57.700 --> 07:59.180]  I wasn't really doing it for that.
[07:59.420 --> 08:00.300]  Which is totally fair.
[08:00.340 --> 08:02.880]  If you're doing it because you just want to do it and make you happy.
[08:02.880 --> 08:04.220]  That is totally valid.
[08:04.380 --> 08:09.140]  But just seeing a clip and also not knowing the full context of the interview,
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.140]  but just seeing one segment where it says, why did he start?
[08:13.220 --> 08:15.500]  This was very funny to me.
[08:17.180 --> 08:19.020]  Andrew just values your time.
[08:19.320 --> 08:20.640]  I value your time, I think.
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.240]  Oh, I don't think he does.
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.200]  I think all of us do.
[08:23.300 --> 08:25.500]  I think we all really value your time.
[08:25.640 --> 08:28.580]  And we all know how hard you work, Gavin.
[08:28.780 --> 08:30.560]  So we we. He does.
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.940]  He works incredibly, insanely creative.
[08:33.200 --> 08:34.440]  We care for and about you.
[08:34.680 --> 08:35.940]  Well, yes, it's appreciated.
[08:36.100 --> 08:41.400]  But I feel like even busy people have there's so much stuff
[08:41.400 --> 08:44.360]  I feel like scheduling where it's like a bunch of stuff on the same day
[08:44.360 --> 08:45.340]  and you have really busy days.
[08:45.440 --> 08:48.280]  But then I might have just a completely empty day.
[08:48.780 --> 08:51.400]  And I just will fill it with whatever, even if like on other days
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.780]  it would be completely worthless.
[08:53.320 --> 08:55.640]  But I think I was still flattered to be asked on it.
[08:55.840 --> 08:56.600]  I'd make time for it.
[08:56.820 --> 08:57.760]  Yeah, I mean, that's fair.
[08:57.860 --> 09:00.360]  If that brings you joy, if you're flattered by it.
[09:00.560 --> 09:01.460]  That's awesome.
[09:01.800 --> 09:05.740]  Just wear a fucking regulation T-shirt next time you do it.
[09:05.840 --> 09:09.400]  Yeah. So if you were asked by another country's morning show
[09:09.400 --> 09:10.680]  to like do that again, you'd do it.
[09:11.520 --> 09:12.100]  Well, yeah.
[09:12.140 --> 09:14.800]  What if what if I because I'm going to be honest, I didn't
[09:14.800 --> 09:17.260]  I didn't love the hosts of that program.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.620]  Just my opinion.
[09:19.960 --> 09:21.780]  I didn't think that they were the most engaging.
[09:22.120 --> 09:23.780]  I thought you did an excellent job.
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.220]  I went and I watched the full thing.
[09:25.420 --> 09:26.240]  I thought you were great.
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.120]  Didn't think your performance was necessarily the best.
[09:29.120 --> 09:30.920]  You were you were great, Gavin.
[09:31.040 --> 09:34.520]  But they were in the middle of just Gavin, Gavin, take the compliment.
[09:34.920 --> 09:36.100]  Take the compliment, man.
[09:36.420 --> 09:38.000]  I'm just defending the hosts.
[09:38.380 --> 09:39.880]  Everybody agrees you were great.
[09:40.060 --> 09:41.600]  Well, I don't want to put you in an awkward spot.
[09:41.740 --> 09:43.040]  I'm not saying you feel this way.
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.220]  I'm stating I feel this way.
[09:44.540 --> 09:47.700]  But what if they were just like day 750 into that job?
[09:47.820 --> 09:49.000]  It's like the middle of the show.
[09:49.140 --> 09:50.080]  They're just absolutely.
[09:50.540 --> 09:53.220]  What if you approach this podcast with that attitude?
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.120]  How dare you?
[09:54.600 --> 09:57.980]  You better be all in on day 750 of regulation.
[09:57.980 --> 10:01.080]  Yeah, it's it's only an hour a week.
[10:01.220 --> 10:03.060]  I'm saying they probably do that all the time.
[10:03.720 --> 10:04.600]  Absolutely. They do.
[10:04.980 --> 10:06.720]  Your interview is so short, man.
[10:06.760 --> 10:08.540]  I don't know. It's like that's way less than an hour.
[10:08.620 --> 10:10.520]  So they should they should be able to get up for that.
[10:10.900 --> 10:11.840]  Yeah. Five questions.
[10:12.340 --> 10:14.340]  Also, it's Gavin fucking free.
[10:14.500 --> 10:17.080]  How often do you get to talk to Gavin fucking free?
[10:17.220 --> 10:18.340]  About once every decade.
[10:18.660 --> 10:19.480]  That's what I'm saying.
[10:19.560 --> 10:20.700]  So Andrew has an idea.
[10:21.380 --> 10:22.940]  I should pitch you to other shows.
[10:23.100 --> 10:26.740]  I think I could find a better morning show for you to be on.
[10:26.740 --> 10:28.740]  Can I ask a question of you?
[10:28.880 --> 10:33.340]  How many morning shows have you appeared in throughout the entirety of your career?
[10:33.880 --> 10:34.760]  Less than 10.
[10:35.220 --> 10:35.880]  Less than 10.
[10:36.180 --> 10:37.600]  OK, so can we just say eight?
[10:37.860 --> 10:39.060]  Then does that seem OK? Sure.
[10:39.360 --> 10:42.480]  What do you think the record for most morning show appearances is?
[10:42.740 --> 10:44.460]  And can we make you break it?
[10:44.740 --> 10:45.540]  I don't know.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.600]  What if Gavin just becomes the morning appearance guy?
[10:49.660 --> 10:53.460]  He's like he's like that dude that brings out like baby kittens and leopards and shit.
[10:53.660 --> 10:54.900]  Oh, yeah.
[10:54.900 --> 10:58.000]  I feel like Jerry O'Connell has done a lot of morning shows.
[10:58.580 --> 11:01.040]  Yeah. Would I be freelance across multiple shows?
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.860]  Could I? It could be like a really like how Howard Stern is the king of all media
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.760]  or the king of old media.
[11:07.260 --> 11:10.000]  And I could be the king of breakfast appearances.
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.120]  Yeah. What if we structured one day where it was different time zones
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.100]  in different countries and you just keep hitting back to back to back mornings?
[11:19.440 --> 11:20.380]  Morning all day?
[11:20.720 --> 11:21.820]  Morning all day.
[11:22.600 --> 11:23.520]  Dude, I love that.
[11:23.520 --> 11:24.820]  Gavin's morning all day.
[11:24.960 --> 11:26.520]  Gavin's the all day brekkie boy.
[11:27.480 --> 11:29.220]  Oh, a brekkie boy.
[11:29.880 --> 11:32.300]  If if you just kept moving around the earth,
[11:32.380 --> 11:36.140]  can you stay inside a morning for like a week straight?
[11:36.440 --> 11:38.440]  I would think so.
[11:38.720 --> 11:41.320]  You just have to have to cross the dateline at the right time.
[11:41.580 --> 11:43.180]  Yeah. For it to be morning.
[11:43.340 --> 11:45.340]  If like if you took off at 11 a.m.
[11:45.340 --> 11:49.840]  and landed earlier some morning of the next day, that might be tough.
[11:50.360 --> 11:51.700]  You'd never need a lunch menu.
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.740]  It saves so much time.
[11:55.560 --> 11:59.100]  I wonder if I was living in mornings for a week,
[11:59.320 --> 12:01.760]  would I want to go through the motions of lunch and dinner
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.500]  or would I just feel so morningy that I keep ordering breakfasts?
[12:05.760 --> 12:07.520]  That's such an interesting question.
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.840]  I feel like I'd get sick of breakfast pretty quick, as much as I love breakfast.
[12:12.300 --> 12:15.440]  Yeah. Three times a day, we'd get old after day two.
[12:15.660 --> 12:18.380]  I don't think I could do pancakes three times a day.
[12:18.840 --> 12:20.740]  Well, you'd probably want to mix up the breakfast.
[12:20.940 --> 12:22.360]  Yeah, you can have a waffle in there somewhere.
[12:22.820 --> 12:25.020]  Yeah, I'd probably go pancake, waffle.
[12:25.180 --> 12:26.560]  Oh, do I go waffle for day?
[12:26.780 --> 12:28.000]  See, this is where it gets tough.
[12:28.120 --> 12:30.720]  But day two, you do four meals.
[12:31.320 --> 12:32.600]  Oh, God. It's over.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.140]  This is a perfect fucking segue for something I want to try with you guys
[12:37.140 --> 12:41.680]  that I have been holding on to for ever.
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.680]  It's been on my notes forever.
[12:43.800 --> 12:46.120]  But I'm going to Google it real fast to fucking find it.
[12:46.320 --> 12:47.900]  OK, you pull it up while you do that.
[12:47.900 --> 12:51.320]  Gavin, can I be can I have a trial run as your booking agent?
[12:51.600 --> 12:53.660]  I can run some options by you potentially.
[12:53.820 --> 12:54.620]  See if there's any other.
[12:54.820 --> 12:56.080]  What's your percentage?
[12:56.860 --> 12:58.680]  Zero. I don't want any money for this.
[12:59.220 --> 13:03.460]  Wow. That's good, because I've never once been paid to appear on television.
[13:03.760 --> 13:05.280]  Really? Yeah. You didn't get.
[13:05.540 --> 13:07.280]  That's wild to me. I'm surprised.
[13:07.660 --> 13:10.160]  I don't think they do. They usually pay people.
[13:10.240 --> 13:11.400]  I don't think I can charge for that.
[13:12.080 --> 13:14.160]  I feel like you should. You're giving up your time.
[13:14.400 --> 13:14.860]  It's an appearance fee.
[13:15.320 --> 13:18.320]  Bernie even pays, pays you to be on morning somewhere, doesn't he?
[13:20.980 --> 13:23.840]  I would say you're you're going to let you're going to let Andrew do this.
[13:24.220 --> 13:25.000]  I think I should.
[13:25.280 --> 13:28.180]  I mean, I did just go on that long rant of how I don't want him to be in charge
[13:28.180 --> 13:31.360]  of anything, but I think I would put you in charge of my appearances.
[13:31.600 --> 13:33.760]  It can just be a trial run. It can just be a trial run.
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.520]  It's a trial run. I'll pitch some. I'll see what I can do.
[13:36.580 --> 13:37.480]  We'll get back to this.
[13:37.620 --> 13:39.720]  I'll throw some appearances at you.
[13:39.880 --> 13:42.700]  Geoff just posted spaghetti pancakes.
[13:42.980 --> 13:43.920]  Yeah, pancakes, spaghetti.
[13:43.920 --> 13:46.840]  Let's say you're on a flight and you're racing the international
[13:46.840 --> 13:49.180]  dateline and you're trying to have it be morning.
[13:49.320 --> 13:52.040]  So all you can eat is breakfast, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
[13:52.160 --> 13:53.380]  Wow. For dinner.
[13:53.500 --> 13:56.820]  Why not have your pancakes spaghetti style?
[13:57.140 --> 14:01.180]  There's a TikTok I saw a while ago about where they use a like a,
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.220]  you know, like a squirter to squirt the pancakes out into thin strips.
[14:05.220 --> 14:06.940]  And then it basically becomes spaghetti.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.440]  And then you cook it up like that, flip it over, get everything cooked.
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.460]  And then you just put like your, you know, maple syrup
[14:13.460 --> 14:17.420]  or your powdered sugar or whatever on it and you eat it spaghetti style.
[14:17.580 --> 14:21.300]  So it's like if you want your entire pancake to taste like the little
[14:21.300 --> 14:24.000]  dreggy smears that are attached to your normal pancakes.
[14:24.300 --> 14:24.960]  Yeah. Yeah.
[14:25.380 --> 14:28.320]  Or if you want like super crispy pancake, you know?
[14:29.620 --> 14:30.100]  Interesting.
[14:30.640 --> 14:33.020]  It's a different take on an old favorite.
[14:33.680 --> 14:36.200]  Could you do like spaghetti shredded potato maybe?
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.500]  Maybe you just extend the shred.
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.420]  I think that would be really good.
[14:40.520 --> 14:44.820]  Anything that you can turn into spaghetti, you can turn into spaghetti, I think.
[14:46.500 --> 14:49.260]  I wonder if you could spaghetti bread
[14:49.260 --> 14:53.720]  and have like a spaghetti sandwich with spaghetti bread and spaghetti ham.
[14:54.060 --> 14:56.200]  So you're just making like a whole spaghetti meal?
[14:56.460 --> 14:59.340]  Like what you have for lunch is spaghetti, but it's like ham sandwich.
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.800]  But you can potentially pick it up like a sandwich still.
[15:01.900 --> 15:03.340]  You'd just be holding all spaghetti.
[15:04.660 --> 15:07.460]  Oh, there's something so gross about having a handful
[15:07.460 --> 15:08.640]  of spaghetti sandwich.
[15:09.060 --> 15:10.020]  Hey, you know what?
[15:10.160 --> 15:11.760]  We have a kitchen to try it out.
[15:11.860 --> 15:13.100]  And now that's true.
[15:13.180 --> 15:14.380]  We can definitely give this a shot.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.280]  We would just need to.
[15:15.420 --> 15:17.080]  How would we get a long string of ham?
[15:18.160 --> 15:19.680]  I didn't really like us.
[15:19.900 --> 15:23.340]  Yeah, we'll get like a we'll get like a good on down to the Honeybake
[15:23.340 --> 15:26.340]  Ham store and eat some lunch while we're there because they have fucking ham
[15:26.340 --> 15:27.040]  sandwiches for lunch.
[15:27.140 --> 15:27.840]  They're pretty fucking solid.
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.140]  And then we'll pick up a big ass spiral ham and then we'll just cut it right.
[15:31.560 --> 15:32.640]  Now, hear me out.
[15:32.860 --> 15:35.840]  I think we could get
[15:35.840 --> 15:38.680]  what this thing is called the Johnny Apple Peeler.
[15:40.380 --> 15:42.920]  And we just do that with ham, right?
[15:43.480 --> 15:43.740]  Ham that.
[15:43.980 --> 15:47.220]  Yeah, I want to see a ham on a Johnny Apple Peeler so bad.
[15:47.360 --> 15:49.820]  But we get we get that with like bread.
[15:50.100 --> 15:50.960]  We do it with cheese.
[15:51.060 --> 15:53.820]  We do it with like everything that you would want.
[15:53.900 --> 15:54.100]  Yeah.
[15:54.260 --> 15:57.920]  If you'll buy us the Johnny Apple Peeler, I'll source the ham.
[15:58.260 --> 16:00.140]  So it's like a food lathe.
[16:00.560 --> 16:02.500]  Do we have to make the ham spherical first?
[16:02.980 --> 16:04.740]  We'll have to cut it down a little bit, I think. Yeah.
[16:04.740 --> 16:06.160]  Yeah, it's OK. We'll do some ham shaving.
[16:06.540 --> 16:08.780]  Should I get the suction base or the clamp base?
[16:10.980 --> 16:12.640]  Clamp base probably for safety.
[16:13.040 --> 16:14.600]  Yeah, we'll put it we can put it on the island.
[16:14.980 --> 16:16.980]  OK, I have it. The suction sucks. Don't do it.
[16:17.040 --> 16:18.660]  You have one of these. Yeah.
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.220]  We'll definitely listen to him then.
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.660]  Yeah, he's an expert.
[16:22.420 --> 16:24.860]  Guess so. Dude, ham spaghetti is going to be fucking delicious.
[16:25.720 --> 16:28.480]  I like the idea of this being almost like a spinoff of does it do?
[16:28.540 --> 16:29.740]  And it's just does it spaghetti?
[16:29.740 --> 16:32.160]  And you just put things in the thing to make spaghetti.
[16:32.660 --> 16:34.300]  I've had I've had that.
[16:34.300 --> 16:36.180]  We were go go for it. Go for it.
[16:36.320 --> 16:40.400]  I was gonna say I've had that link in my in my notes since November, I think.
[16:40.420 --> 16:41.120]  Oh, that's awesome.
[16:41.260 --> 16:42.420]  We were trying to find a way to bring.
[16:42.500 --> 16:43.980]  We were getting stuff moved out
[16:44.700 --> 16:48.060]  that we had kept in storage to get to like the new space.
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.760]  And Gavin had the does it do paintings that you guys made?
[16:54.800 --> 16:57.260]  And those are going to be hanging in the in the office.
[16:57.620 --> 17:00.220]  That's crazy. Yeah, we kept him. Unbelievable.
[17:00.220 --> 17:02.820]  It's amazing how much shit there was.
[17:02.820 --> 17:06.800]  Did you guys film the throwing of the patch on a shirt at distance?
[17:07.060 --> 17:08.100]  Is there video of that?
[17:08.480 --> 17:10.520]  Yes. Yeah, Gavin has it, I think.
[17:10.660 --> 17:11.500]  I have it on my phone.
[17:11.680 --> 17:13.940]  Yeah. OK, as you say, I filmed it on somebody else's phone, though.
[17:14.140 --> 17:16.640]  Someone should post that because I want to see it.
[17:16.780 --> 17:17.680]  Oh, maybe it was on Gavin's phone.
[17:18.220 --> 17:21.420]  I thought I filmed it, but we should get that up there because that sounds amazing.
[17:21.640 --> 17:24.840]  Maybe you did film it because you were you were throwing the patch on me.
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.120]  That's what it was. You did film it.
[17:26.500 --> 17:28.600]  OK, that's exactly what it was because I was wearing the shirt.
[17:28.600 --> 17:32.100]  Well, then there's a good chance I hit record after I should have stopped
[17:32.100 --> 17:34.400]  or that I filmed our feet.
[17:34.560 --> 17:37.240]  But now would you call that the video being corrupted?
[17:38.120 --> 17:40.320]  No, I'd call that me being me.
[17:40.700 --> 17:43.200]  The video getting getting Geoffed.
[17:43.200 --> 17:44.380]  Geoff, I'm going to take that.
[17:44.480 --> 17:46.900]  That'll that saves a lot of time for me.
[17:48.160 --> 17:50.360]  I guess we had a word. It's salad cream, right?
[17:50.760 --> 17:52.100]  Yeah. Essentially. Greg.
[17:53.040 --> 17:54.200]  Greg did. Yeah.
[17:54.620 --> 17:57.820]  Speaking of speaking of getting Greg, man, I got fucking Greg
[17:57.820 --> 17:58.680]  at McDonald's today.
[17:59.060 --> 18:00.660]  You got Greg at McDonald's?
[18:00.800 --> 18:03.680]  I had to go maybe just salad cream, but I was fucking annoyed.
[18:03.940 --> 18:07.140]  I had to go up and get some meds for the dog on the other side of town
[18:07.140 --> 18:07.980]  back where I used to live,
[18:08.060 --> 18:10.820]  which is where the McDonald's I used to always fight with was.
[18:11.300 --> 18:14.140]  And I thought for old time's sake, maybe I'll swing by my old McDonald's
[18:14.140 --> 18:14.720]  to get some breakfast.
[18:15.080 --> 18:18.460]  I get into the drive through and I tried to make it as simple as possible,
[18:18.460 --> 18:19.240]  as I always do.
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.640]  And I just said, I'll take a number four with cheese and Diet Coke.
[18:23.140 --> 18:25.760]  And she goes, we don't have any soda today.
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.820]  And that's all she said.
[18:28.000 --> 18:29.320]  Like there was no like follow up to that.
[18:29.400 --> 18:31.780]  And I went, I waited for a while, just silence.
[18:32.960 --> 18:34.540]  Can I get orange juice?
[18:34.860 --> 18:36.100]  And she goes, OK.
[18:36.960 --> 18:40.720]  And then she goes, number four, sir, number four doesn't come with cheese.
[18:41.220 --> 18:43.600]  And I go, yeah, that's why I requested cheese.
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.080]  That's why I requested the cheese.
[18:45.140 --> 18:47.660]  I'm trying to add the cheese to it, which, by the way, a number four
[18:47.660 --> 18:52.720]  in breakfast is just a fucking sausage biscuit, sausage egg biscuit.
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.760]  And the number three is the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.
[18:55.960 --> 18:58.600]  Why the fuck doesn't sausage get cheese by default?
[18:58.800 --> 19:01.240]  Why do I have to add cheese to it every fucking time?
[19:01.560 --> 19:02.700]  Bacon gets free cheese.
[19:02.840 --> 19:04.280]  Why doesn't sausage get free cheese?
[19:04.460 --> 19:06.240]  Makes no goddamn sense, McDonald's.
[19:06.300 --> 19:08.940]  But anyway, that was hyper aggressive the way she said it, sir.
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.720]  It doesn't. And she and I was like, well, that's why I'm requesting cheese.
[19:11.800 --> 19:12.820]  I'd like to add the cheese to it.
[19:12.840 --> 19:17.060]  And she goes, she's really, she goes, oh, and then I pull around.
[19:17.320 --> 19:20.020]  Doesn't even look at me, takes my money or whatever, sends me to the next thing.
[19:20.020 --> 19:24.880]  I come up to the lady and she goes, we can't get to the orange juice right now.
[19:25.640 --> 19:29.480]  What? She goes, it's hard to get to the orange juice right now.
[19:29.560 --> 19:30.940]  Do you want lemonade instead?
[19:31.480 --> 19:34.100]  And I was like, I fucking guess.
[19:34.420 --> 19:40.700]  And so I ended up with my third choice for drink when I went to McDonald's today.
[19:40.800 --> 19:43.400]  And I got sass for asking for fucking cheese.
[19:43.540 --> 19:47.840]  So they got, I assume, a delivery and they have to sell their way to the orange juice.
[19:47.840 --> 19:50.760]  I don't know. I don't know what was going on in there, man.
[19:51.140 --> 19:53.140]  But she was like, it's hard to get to right now.
[19:53.180 --> 19:55.720]  It's like, OK, I don't want your job to be hard.
[19:56.340 --> 19:57.900]  Give me whatever's available, I guess.
[19:57.960 --> 19:59.880]  And why do you have lemonade but not soda?
[19:59.940 --> 20:01.120]  They come into the same fucking machine.
[20:01.220 --> 20:02.220]  But OK, that's cool.
[20:02.700 --> 20:04.720]  They're running a McDonald's like a game of solitaire.
[20:05.160 --> 20:07.840]  Dude, every time I go to that McDonald's, it's oof.
[20:08.160 --> 20:09.200]  It's a blueprints puzzle.
[20:09.460 --> 20:10.180]  They need the RNG.
[20:10.360 --> 20:12.160]  They just can't get the orange juice to drop.
[20:12.240 --> 20:13.480]  But we do got lemonade, sir.
[20:14.520 --> 20:16.600]  I like that McDonald's because at that McDonald's,
[20:16.600 --> 20:18.160]  the customer is always, fuck you.
[20:20.100 --> 20:21.740]  So you got the cheese at least?
[20:21.940 --> 20:24.420]  I got the cheese and it was fucking delicious.
[20:25.300 --> 20:28.320]  They are no, no shade to the cooks who put that together
[20:28.320 --> 20:29.980]  because they did a phenomenal job.
[20:30.040 --> 20:30.900]  And I'll be honest with you.
[20:31.120 --> 20:31.820]  Lemonade was great.
[20:32.260 --> 20:33.060]  Wasn't what I wanted.
[20:33.380 --> 20:35.940]  Wasn't the replacement for what I wanted, but it was good.
[20:36.280 --> 20:38.920]  Weren't you saying how when we got burgers the other day,
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.560]  it'd been so long since you had fast food?
[20:40.860 --> 20:44.280]  Yeah, it had been a long time since I had fast food when we did that.
[20:44.380 --> 20:46.280]  But yeah, I ripped that bandaid off.
[20:47.180 --> 20:48.640]  Got that McDonald's.
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.760]  I had the jersey mics yesterday and I had McDonald's for breakfast today.
[20:53.120 --> 20:53.700]  Look at that.

[22:11.620 --> 22:14.200]  I want to know about what's going on with this TV
[22:14.200 --> 22:17.120]  because I keep hearing about a TV in relation to the office
[22:17.120 --> 22:18.940]  and there's something that's occurred.
[22:19.540 --> 22:23.080]  Geoff and I went shopping and then we put the TV.
[22:23.420 --> 22:25.180]  Well, can I can I preface?
[22:25.300 --> 22:26.420]  Can I just take it back a second?
[22:26.600 --> 22:30.780]  Yeah. Eric and I rented a U-Haul couple, I guess last week at this point.
[22:31.640 --> 22:34.960]  And we needed that because we had a bunch of stuff to pick up.
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.700]  We wanted to get stuff from Gavin's studio.
[22:37.160 --> 22:40.780]  We wanted to go pick up stuff from Tina and Ray
[22:40.780 --> 22:43.760]  that they were given some extra stuff that they had.
[22:44.520 --> 22:46.560]  And then we also where else did we go, Eric?
[22:46.640 --> 22:48.120]  We had to go some third location, too.
[22:48.200 --> 22:50.840]  We had to go to my house where Kitchen Island was delivered.
[22:51.180 --> 22:52.680]  That's right. We had to go to your house for Kitchen Island.
[22:52.780 --> 22:54.740]  So we basically were in the U-Haul all day.
[22:55.160 --> 22:56.580]  The heaviest fucking thing, too.
[22:56.960 --> 22:58.440]  So heavy getting that thing to the car.
[22:58.700 --> 22:58.920]  It was fucked.
[22:58.940 --> 23:03.340]  We definitely saved heaviest and shittiest for last, which in retrospect
[23:03.340 --> 23:04.520]  was maybe not the best idea.
[23:04.820 --> 23:06.320]  But while we're out driving around, I go,
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.220]  hey, man, we need to get a TV for the office for like the co-op room and everything.
[23:10.500 --> 23:13.000]  We should just go to Costco and pick one up while we have the U-Haul.
[23:13.100 --> 23:14.680]  And Eric's like, I don't do that. It's a long way away.
[23:14.800 --> 23:16.580]  I don't know. And I'm like, I know, but we have the U-Haul.
[23:16.800 --> 23:18.040]  Now would be the time to do it.
[23:18.060 --> 23:19.020]  And he's like, we'll deal with it later.
[23:19.100 --> 23:22.400]  So I was like, OK, you Gavin, you can frame this.
[23:22.660 --> 23:25.220]  Shut up. You can frame this however you want.
[23:25.860 --> 23:29.340]  A hundred inch TV is fucking psycho behavior.
[23:29.800 --> 23:31.120]  That nobody has got an inch.
[23:31.580 --> 23:34.920]  Nobody bought. First off, nobody bought a hundred inch TV. OK.
[23:35.420 --> 23:38.320]  I saw one and I said that there was one available on sale.
[23:38.440 --> 23:39.300]  We didn't buy one.
[23:39.720 --> 23:43.480]  Did you know, though, you could get a 98 inch TV at Costco
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.080]  for like eleven hundred bucks or something?
[23:46.480 --> 23:47.560]  That's ridiculous.
[23:48.380 --> 23:49.840]  There's a better photo that Gavin has.
[23:50.180 --> 23:52.140]  It's too big to fit on the wall.
[23:52.540 --> 23:54.060]  So Gavin, technically, yes.
[23:54.100 --> 23:57.960]  So Gavin and I, we were hanging out the next day putting stuff together.
[23:58.080 --> 24:00.760]  I was putting chairs together and he was building shelves and stuff.
[24:00.980 --> 24:04.200]  And we thought, hey, why don't we go get Emily's
[24:04.200 --> 24:05.760]  SUV because she's got a bigger car.
[24:06.340 --> 24:08.680]  And we'll just go to Costco and pick up a TV and bring it back
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.660]  because we're going to need one.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.560]  At this point, we've already used it for the live stream.
[24:11.720 --> 24:13.240]  Like it's an integral piece of technology.
[24:13.820 --> 24:16.460]  And it's one of the like hanging chads we have out there, though.
[24:16.540 --> 24:18.020]  It still isn't in process.
[24:18.160 --> 24:20.360]  You know, like computer equipment's already been ordered.
[24:20.600 --> 24:21.760]  Sound equipment's already been ordered.
[24:22.040 --> 24:23.000]  Furniture's all already been ordered.
[24:23.060 --> 24:26.420]  But like there's a few odds and ends like the TV that is just sitting out there.
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.880]  And so we drove over to Costco and we got to Costco.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.960]  I was smart. I brought our...
[24:31.960 --> 24:33.100]  I brought a tape measure.
[24:33.100 --> 24:36.220]  And we laid the back of the SUV down
[24:36.220 --> 24:39.660]  and I measured the width inside from wall to wall.
[24:39.820 --> 24:41.020]  It was 43 inches.
[24:41.620 --> 24:46.620]  And so I told Gavin, we can buy a TV as big as 43 inches wide.
[24:47.580 --> 24:48.980]  And then... or high, yeah.
[24:49.340 --> 24:52.780]  And then we went and we measured every TV
[24:52.780 --> 24:56.540]  until we found a TV that was 43 inches high.
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.240]  Now, you may have immediately noticed the problem in that the packaging
[25:01.240 --> 25:04.320]  is going to be much bigger than the TV.
[25:04.620 --> 25:08.240]  Yeah. Yeah. You know, like aren't the packages out there with the TVs?
[25:08.420 --> 25:09.360]  It's not just the TVs.
[25:09.600 --> 25:11.420]  And you guys were just measuring the TVs then?
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.040]  But here's why. Because we knew if we took the TV out of the packaging,
[25:17.660 --> 25:18.800]  it would fit.
[25:19.480 --> 25:20.820]  Who needs the packaging?
[25:20.980 --> 25:22.160]  We're not saving the packaging.
[25:22.560 --> 25:24.220]  It's just a thing we got to throw away later, right?
[25:24.440 --> 25:28.000]  So we bought the TV that was 43 inches tall
[25:28.560 --> 25:31.520]  to fit into a space that was exactly 43 inches wide,
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.700]  which in retrospect, maybe we could have given ourselves an inch leeway there.
[25:35.940 --> 25:39.120]  Yeah. Also, at no point did we measure depth.
[25:39.880 --> 25:41.000]  That became an issue.
[25:42.220 --> 25:46.780]  And we go out into the park a lot and we don't have any tools.
[25:46.920 --> 25:48.000]  They didn't have any tools at Costco,
[25:48.220 --> 25:50.780]  so we didn't have any tools to take the TV out of the packaging.
[25:50.820 --> 25:52.700]  It's got like those plastic bands around it and shit.
[25:52.880 --> 25:56.120]  But I remembered that Emily had just bought this thing on Amazon
[25:56.120 --> 26:01.040]  where if you get if your card sinks into a pool or a river,
[26:01.340 --> 26:05.240]  you can like pop the window out and it's got the little thing that cuts the seatbelt.
[26:05.460 --> 26:06.960]  And so I grabbed that.
[26:07.600 --> 26:08.960]  We used it to cut.
[26:09.060 --> 26:10.580]  I put a picture in slack of this package.
[26:11.160 --> 26:12.080]  Oh, my God.
[26:13.460 --> 26:17.460]  It's way too powerful for Discord.
[26:18.740 --> 26:22.520]  And so, by the way, the TV size we were able to get was 86 inches.
[26:22.520 --> 26:25.360]  And so we...
[26:26.500 --> 26:27.420]  Jesus Christ.
[26:27.920 --> 26:29.520]  We take it completely apart.
[26:30.000 --> 26:34.600]  Somehow taking a TV out of a packaging makes the packaging way bigger
[26:34.600 --> 26:35.840]  than it was when it was all together.
[26:36.060 --> 26:39.260]  There's so much packaging everywhere, so much siren from the packaging ever.
[26:39.820 --> 26:44.280]  And the TV, the TV is so heavy and unwieldy
[26:44.280 --> 26:46.200]  because it doesn't have legs on it or anything. Right.
[26:46.240 --> 26:48.120]  And if it did, we'd have to take them off because they wouldn't fit.
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.140]  And so we get it sideways, finally, outside of all the packaging,
[26:52.140 --> 26:54.660]  which is next to impossible because there's nothing to put it on other than the ground.
[26:54.780 --> 26:56.220]  It was a whole fucking thing, right?
[26:56.340 --> 26:59.680]  Just a whole nightmare of a thing that we were having a delight doing.
[26:59.780 --> 27:01.340]  By the way, I was having time in my life.
[27:01.500 --> 27:05.740]  Then we were able to get the TV sideways, get it up onto the car.
[27:06.520 --> 27:10.220]  86 inch TV weighs almost as much as a kitchen island, it turns out.
[27:10.760 --> 27:12.340]  And we get it shoved in.
[27:12.540 --> 27:14.500]  There's about, I don't know, Gav, what do you say?
[27:14.540 --> 27:16.620]  Like six inches of TV sticking out of the back?
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.760]  Yeah, we we didn't take into account the the thickness of the door.
[27:23.140 --> 27:29.840]  Yeah. And so we had to move both of the front seats as far forward
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.100]  as they would go and then forward and then wedge the TV in
[27:34.100 --> 27:38.900]  and then honestly slam the car door on it and hope it didn't break.
[27:39.340 --> 27:40.520]  I put another picture in Slack.
[27:40.960 --> 27:42.460]  It made a noise, but it didn't break.
[27:42.880 --> 27:43.820]  Oh, no.
[27:46.620 --> 27:47.740]  Oh, yeah, you can see.
[27:49.100 --> 27:53.180]  But then we were squashed up against the dashboard.
[27:54.540 --> 27:55.260]  So then
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.160]  this is the dumbest part.
[27:59.560 --> 28:01.820]  So then we had a whole box worth of TV trash.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.440]  And I was like, I was like, what do we do with all this trash?
[28:04.460 --> 28:06.100]  And I was like, I genuinely don't know.
[28:06.320 --> 28:08.520]  I didn't get that far in my head buying the TV.
[28:08.640 --> 28:09.900]  I just thought we'd take it out.
[28:10.180 --> 28:12.140]  And the car is full of TV, right?
[28:12.200 --> 28:15.080]  And so we look around and we try to put it all back together.
[28:15.080 --> 28:16.760]  And I'm like, there's got to be a dumpster or something.
[28:16.920 --> 28:19.100]  And we can't find anything and we can't fit it.
[28:19.200 --> 28:24.060]  And so we just put it all in back on the cart and kind of put it over out of the way.
[28:24.160 --> 28:25.440]  And then we just left.
[28:25.600 --> 28:29.760]  And then about three seconds on the road, we looked at each other and went,
[28:29.880 --> 28:32.340]  we can't be we can't do that. That's terrible.
[28:32.520 --> 28:33.800]  That's we're going to ruin somebody's day.
[28:34.100 --> 28:35.880]  Well, I wanted to tell us like an employee.
[28:35.940 --> 28:38.360]  I mean, like, is there a place we could dump it?
[28:38.420 --> 28:42.080]  Or so then we were driving around looking and then we would stay at the exit.
[28:42.240 --> 28:44.080]  We had to make a real split decision.
[28:44.080 --> 28:46.500]  So we left and then we're like, no, no, no, we can't.
[28:46.600 --> 28:47.000]  We can't do it.
[28:47.040 --> 28:50.000]  So we turned around and we came back in and on the way back in,
[28:50.040 --> 28:51.840]  we found a dumpster at another store.
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.340]  So we went back to where we left the TV box and we took it apart piece by piece
[28:56.340 --> 28:58.400]  and slid it all into the car.
[28:58.540 --> 29:01.680]  You can see it hanging out of our heads there and then drove over to a dumpster
[29:01.680 --> 29:03.260]  and then put it all in the dumpster.
[29:03.380 --> 29:06.780]  And then we had five guys and holy shit, five guys is expensive.
[29:07.100 --> 29:08.520]  Dude, we did the maths on it.
[29:08.560 --> 29:09.720]  We had two burgers, right?
[29:09.740 --> 29:11.680]  And it came to, I think, like $50.
[29:12.940 --> 29:13.660]  That's insane.
[29:13.660 --> 29:16.380]  Yeah, it was $50 and like 45 cents.
[29:16.680 --> 29:21.140]  That means like a burger is it's like a 40th of a TV.
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.200]  Like if we had that meal, we could have had that meal 20 times
[29:26.200 --> 29:28.260]  before we'd spent as much money on the TV.
[29:28.540 --> 29:33.280]  Should a TV be like 20 burgers, not 40 or like 200 burgers?
[29:33.400 --> 29:36.180]  I mean, like, yeah, I think that's the problem with the world is that
[29:36.180 --> 29:40.280]  you could buy all this massive shit, but the actual day to day,
[29:40.400 --> 29:42.880]  the lunches is what's doing everyone in.
[29:42.880 --> 29:45.400]  I should be able to have 200 burgers per TV.
[29:46.500 --> 29:47.540]  I'm right there with you.
[29:47.600 --> 29:49.520]  The burger conversion doesn't work, dude.
[29:49.580 --> 29:50.440]  It's like, what do we get?
[29:50.480 --> 29:54.540]  We got two bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of fries and two sodas.
[29:54.780 --> 29:57.540]  Yeah, we're buying a TV that's like less than $10 an inch.
[29:57.760 --> 29:59.760]  So you got this at Costco, right?
[30:00.180 --> 30:00.980]  Yeah. Yeah.
[30:01.080 --> 30:03.140]  Oh, man, I would be so anxious
[30:03.680 --> 30:07.320]  trying to load that in the car of a Costco parking lot
[30:07.840 --> 30:10.860]  just filled with people, people wanting your space.
[30:10.860 --> 30:13.700]  Oh, that sounds terrible.
[30:14.080 --> 30:17.640]  Oh, dude, it was we were playing dickhead calisthenics without even trying
[30:17.640 --> 30:20.340]  because they were cars like Gavin saw firsthand.
[30:20.500 --> 30:21.200]  There were cars waiting.
[30:21.300 --> 30:23.820]  They would just sit and watch us for like 20 seconds and then give up and leave
[30:24.840 --> 30:27.100]  because we were out there for a fucking while.
[30:27.460 --> 30:28.520]  It would take so long.
[30:28.860 --> 30:30.720]  I might cut a little video of our process.
[30:30.840 --> 30:33.180]  I would love to see physically loading it in.
[30:33.220 --> 30:34.760]  But all of this because I was helping carry it.
[30:34.880 --> 30:37.380]  But all the stuff around it, we've got I've documented it.
[30:37.920 --> 30:41.840]  It was it took two minutes to buy and 20 minutes to get it in the car,
[30:42.360 --> 30:43.460]  but it fucking worked.
[30:43.880 --> 30:46.440]  And then we got it back to the office and we put it in the spot
[30:46.440 --> 30:48.020]  where everybody knew the TV would go.
[30:48.140 --> 30:51.440]  And it's it's like four inches bigger than the wall.
[30:51.440 --> 30:55.240]  Maybe banks out into the doorway or you won't be able to open the closet.
[30:55.480 --> 30:56.600]  So what happened there?
[30:56.660 --> 30:58.320]  Did you guys measure the wall?
[30:58.520 --> 31:04.000]  It's now your we measured it off to measure it after it was too big.
[31:04.460 --> 31:08.620]  I love I love that you had the 43 inch thing that you were like locked in on,
[31:08.700 --> 31:09.740]  but you didn't measure the wall.
[31:09.880 --> 31:12.660]  I feel like that's the important thing for right.
[31:12.840 --> 31:14.640]  The important thing was to get it back.
[31:14.820 --> 31:18.260]  I guess. Yeah, like that's how TV fits in that space.
[31:18.740 --> 31:20.340]  Yeah, you can see it hanging over.
[31:20.580 --> 31:21.820]  Let me look at it.
[31:21.920 --> 31:24.760]  And it's just resting on the on the console table.
[31:25.000 --> 31:25.820]  So ridiculous.
[31:26.200 --> 31:27.480]  The legs don't.
[31:27.580 --> 31:31.540]  Yeah, it's not said to stop either, so it doesn't even fit on the table.
[31:31.540 --> 31:37.800]  But the thing that I the thing that I noticed is that you guys also bought a wall mount.
[31:39.220 --> 31:41.260]  Yeah, we're going to bounce on that table.
[31:41.840 --> 31:43.900]  What's the plan with the wall mount?
[31:44.340 --> 31:48.300]  Well, we can either shimmy into the room or we can leave the closet door open.
[31:49.900 --> 31:50.880]  That's the plan.
[31:51.500 --> 31:54.720]  Or we can mount it to a different wall or the wall to the right.
[31:54.900 --> 31:57.520]  Yeah, there's a there's the less funny option of putting it on the other wall.
[31:58.060 --> 31:58.580]  It's up to you.
[31:58.580 --> 32:01.540]  It looks like Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall.
[32:01.720 --> 32:02.420]  It's going to fall.
[32:02.560 --> 32:04.060]  Its legs are just dangling.
[32:04.420 --> 32:05.500]  Oh, yeah, that's not safe.
[32:05.600 --> 32:07.860]  We took that down the second with the photo shoot was over.
[32:08.180 --> 32:10.000]  That was just for y'all.
[32:10.440 --> 32:13.420]  And we watched a little bit of Total Wipeout with Hammond,
[32:13.500 --> 32:17.160]  with Richard Hammond in like 240p or whatever it was.
[32:17.320 --> 32:18.080]  Yeah, it looks great.
[32:18.900 --> 32:19.980]  Yeah, the TV looks.
[32:20.260 --> 32:21.940]  The TV does, in fact, look better than that.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.720]  That was that was the Hulu show we put on.
[32:24.240 --> 32:26.080]  This was my view of Geoff as we were.
[32:28.580 --> 32:30.660]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[32:33.100 --> 32:36.360]  So this the TV isn't in a finalized spot yet.
[32:36.400 --> 32:38.220]  We're still it's still being figured out.
[32:38.360 --> 32:40.480]  No, it's still still being figured out.
[32:40.620 --> 32:41.380]  That's crazy.
[32:41.960 --> 32:44.020]  We just wanted to make some real progress.
[32:44.360 --> 32:46.320]  And we and so we did.
[32:47.420 --> 32:51.860]  It's really exciting to have the progress, but it's so funny to me
[32:51.860 --> 32:54.540]  that you guys measured if it would fit in the car, but not the wall.
[32:54.860 --> 32:56.020]  Well, that seemed like the bottleneck.
[32:56.280 --> 32:58.440]  Yeah. Could you imagine something worse than getting a cut?
[32:58.440 --> 33:02.040]  The TV to the car and having it not fit, then you're really screwed.
[33:02.500 --> 33:04.940]  I feel like there's what... Can you strap a...
[33:04.940 --> 33:07.340]  Can you strap a TV to the top of the car?
[33:08.020 --> 33:09.800]  I see it on TikTok all the time.
[33:09.900 --> 33:10.800]  Very rarely goes well.
[33:10.940 --> 33:12.620]  Might go flying. Oh, yeah, that's true.
[33:12.940 --> 33:15.660]  We were actually trying to milk the inches even more,
[33:15.680 --> 33:16.640]  and then we decided against it.
[33:16.640 --> 33:19.740]  But we realized when we were measuring, we measured like horizontally
[33:19.740 --> 33:21.860]  the hole in the car that we could get the TV through.
[33:22.140 --> 33:25.320]  And then as we were measuring the height of TVs, Geoff was like,
[33:25.660 --> 33:28.260]  I mean, if we measured the hole in the car diagonally,
[33:28.440 --> 33:30.780]  we could get slightly more inches.
[33:31.160 --> 33:32.780]  But we didn't go that far.
[33:33.720 --> 33:35.140]  We wanted it to lie down flat.
[33:37.000 --> 33:38.300]  Yeah, instead of wedging it.
[33:38.500 --> 33:41.060]  But I think we could have got an 88 in there at a push.
[33:41.280 --> 33:43.620]  It would have just been diagonally in the car.
[33:44.080 --> 33:46.380]  I, uh, I just would have been a little more precarious.
[33:46.600 --> 33:50.700]  I, uh, I think that I appreciate how conservative we went with it, Gavin.
[33:51.080 --> 33:53.480]  Yeah, I think we've I think we really reined it in.
[33:53.640 --> 33:55.440]  Like it's big, but it's not too big.
[33:55.760 --> 33:56.940]  It's not comically big.
[33:57.360 --> 33:58.600]  Under a thousand dollars.
[33:58.800 --> 34:00.160]  Yeah, it was like 800 bucks.
[34:01.040 --> 34:02.500]  That's crazy. Wow.
[34:02.600 --> 34:06.060]  Which by also, by the way, fucking Costco doesn't take American Express.
[34:06.060 --> 34:07.980]  So the company owes me eight hundred dollars.
[34:10.000 --> 34:10.360]  Debatable.
[34:12.760 --> 34:13.640]  You're going to love that.
[34:13.800 --> 34:15.840]  Just going to take his TV and go home.
[34:15.900 --> 34:16.680]  I can't. I can't.
[34:16.760 --> 34:16.980]  I'm not.
[34:17.040 --> 34:19.440]  He can figure if he can figure out how to get it back in that car.
[34:19.620 --> 34:20.900]  Absolutely. Too hard.
[34:21.520 --> 34:22.260]  I'll film it.
[34:22.660 --> 34:25.020]  No, what you'll do is you'll watch awesome stuff on the TV.
[34:25.020 --> 34:29.480]  You need to like strap suspenders to the back of it
[34:29.480 --> 34:32.860]  and then throw it over your back and just walked in the street like a villain.
[34:33.780 --> 34:35.800]  We could have spent so much more money on a TV.
[34:36.020 --> 34:37.280]  They they get so expensive.
[34:37.580 --> 34:38.240]  But we were very.
[34:38.440 --> 34:41.660]  We walked past all the nice stuff, like all the the OLEDs
[34:41.660 --> 34:44.400]  and all the the modern refresh rates.
[34:45.600 --> 34:47.000]  We just went for size.
[34:48.120 --> 34:49.280]  Well, and for price.
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.580]  So this is going to be where like Mario Party is played this TV.
[34:53.580 --> 34:55.340]  This is like the central gaming TV.
[34:55.800 --> 34:57.700]  Yeah, this is where it was played at this point.
[34:58.080 --> 35:01.400]  OK, I always think about like when Halo two was new.
[35:01.520 --> 35:07.020]  I probably played twenty five hundred games of Halo two on a four by three
[35:07.020 --> 35:10.080]  14 inch TV with a VCR built into it.
[35:10.320 --> 35:10.800]  Absolutely.
[35:11.260 --> 35:14.580]  So the fact that you can play Mario Party on this, where each screen
[35:14.580 --> 35:18.280]  of a split screen is bigger than my entire TV.
[35:18.620 --> 35:21.880]  I love that. Yeah, it's I mean, the price TVs.
[35:22.100 --> 35:23.120]  It's crazy how it's.
[35:23.120 --> 35:28.160]  I remember spending essentially how much you guys paid for a mid tier
[35:28.780 --> 35:32.320]  50 inch TV like over a little over a decade ago.
[35:32.560 --> 35:35.360]  But I'm going to save up my money and being so excited of like,
[35:35.400 --> 35:36.620]  oh, this is a big purchase.
[35:36.760 --> 35:40.500]  And now just seeing like that you can get an 86 inch or whatever
[35:40.500 --> 35:42.880]  that is for the same price is insane.
[35:43.320 --> 35:46.640]  The first TV I bought myself was a as a 32 inch
[35:48.160 --> 35:51.020]  720P Philips, and it was 900 pounds.
[35:51.680 --> 35:52.820]  Oh, my God.
[35:53.100 --> 35:55.940]  Well, I remember, Gavin, the first time we bought a TV together,
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.400]  we were talking about the day you were visiting for the summer
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.560]  and I was finally ready to upgrade to a flat screen TV.
[36:01.900 --> 36:03.840]  And I bought at Best Buy. We went together.
[36:03.980 --> 36:08.940]  I think I bought a 36 inch TV maybe or 40 inch.
[36:09.220 --> 36:13.180]  It was similar in size to your previous one, but it was I think it was HD, right?
[36:13.220 --> 36:14.700]  It was HD. The other one was ETV.
[36:15.440 --> 36:18.060]  And and I want to say it was like twenty seven hundred bucks.
[36:18.320 --> 36:19.920]  Oh, my God. That's crazy.
[36:19.920 --> 36:22.940]  I found a picture of the the TV.
[36:23.040 --> 36:23.700]  I played Halo 2.
[36:24.140 --> 36:28.220]  That boy, dude, that's a that picture
[36:28.220 --> 36:31.960]  you could post anywhere on the Internet and it's just like nostalgia bait
[36:31.960 --> 36:33.220]  for people our age.
[36:33.300 --> 36:35.000]  Yeah, absolutely. That's insane.
[36:35.340 --> 36:37.880]  I love the Jackass box set. Yeah, absolutely.
[36:38.580 --> 36:41.100]  I got chrome skin on my original Xbox.
[36:41.420 --> 36:43.880]  Wow. Hell yeah, you do.
[36:44.200 --> 36:45.500]  And the DVD remote.
[36:46.400 --> 36:48.740]  What is the what does that say at the top?
[36:48.740 --> 36:49.940]  Is that like a little name tag?
[36:50.280 --> 36:53.400]  Kind of like, you know, it says it says Gavin's phone hands off.
[36:55.400 --> 36:56.460]  It's already cool.
[36:56.720 --> 36:58.080]  It was pretty cool.
[36:59.700 --> 37:01.500]  I have a serial killer update.
[37:02.040 --> 37:03.460]  Oh, no. Your house.
[37:04.200 --> 37:05.100]  Is there more carcasses?
[37:05.640 --> 37:06.640]  There have been two incidents.
[37:06.940 --> 37:11.580]  One, I had I I can smell the scent of death
[37:11.580 --> 37:16.500]  around the side of my house, but I cannot find the location of the death.
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.540]  But something has definitely been decomposing somewhere on the side of my house,
[37:20.560 --> 37:21.720]  and I just cannot locate it.
[37:21.960 --> 37:24.300]  I'm also not looking too hard because it's fucking gross.
[37:24.380 --> 37:25.860]  Whatever. When I find it.
[37:26.280 --> 37:28.980]  But the other night, I think I may have seen the serial killer,
[37:29.440 --> 37:33.680]  at least certainly a the first prime suspect.
[37:34.180 --> 37:37.060]  I went out and now I've unlocked a new fear in life, too.
[37:37.440 --> 37:41.360]  I went out to throw some trash away in my trash can and I lifted the trash can up
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.880]  and I threw like, I don't know, a bag of food or something in there.
[37:43.880 --> 37:46.500]  And something shifted when I did that.
[37:46.620 --> 37:48.660]  And I just dropped the top and I thought, what the fuck?
[37:48.720 --> 37:51.320]  You know, I like took a step back for a second and I went, what the fuck?
[37:51.380 --> 37:54.860]  And right as I took a step back, the lid exploded open
[37:54.860 --> 37:58.640]  and the biggest, fattest raccoon I've ever seen in my life
[37:59.100 --> 38:02.780]  scrambled out, looked at me, jumped over the edge and slowly,
[38:02.900 --> 38:05.800]  because he was so hefty, climbed over my fence and took off.
[38:05.960 --> 38:09.300]  And I think that my he was well fed.
[38:09.360 --> 38:09.980]  I'll say that.
[38:10.280 --> 38:12.260]  And I think it might be him.
[38:12.260 --> 38:17.800]  I think he's the only other predator animal I've seen, you know, in my yard.
[38:17.980 --> 38:19.840]  And once again, I'm watching the bird thing.
[38:19.940 --> 38:20.880]  There's been no owls.
[38:20.980 --> 38:22.380]  There's been no birds of prey around.
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.020]  And so I think it's either a fox or this mega raccoon.
[38:26.160 --> 38:28.180]  Are they known for ripping up squirrels?
[38:28.180 --> 38:30.340]  I think they'll eat anything if they get their hands on it.
[38:30.340 --> 38:31.460]  I think they can be pretty vicious.
[38:32.080 --> 38:33.700]  He definitely scared the shit out of me.
[38:33.760 --> 38:35.820]  And now I'm scared to open my trash can at night anymore.
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.180]  He probably weighed, he was his, Albert's 65 pounds or so.
[38:42.300 --> 38:47.940]  He was probably 40, like he was a sizable, maybe that's way too big to be a raccoon.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.380]  But he was like as big around as my fucking dog.
[38:50.420 --> 38:51.860]  It seemed like he was huge.
[38:52.420 --> 38:58.100]  And he definitely, he definitely wasn't in great shape because I was watching him, even shocked watching him get up the fence.
[38:58.180 --> 38:58.920]  It was pretty comical.
[38:59.540 --> 39:03.560]  While we were in the car, Geoff, I, uh, you said something and then I wrote in my notes,
[39:04.480 --> 39:05.540]  Geoff's strike idea.
[39:06.120 --> 39:07.100]  What was that?
[39:07.680 --> 39:08.880]  Geoff's strike idea.
[39:09.460 --> 39:12.280]  It has to be something related to the Files, right?
[39:12.400 --> 39:13.940]  Gotta be, gotta be.
[39:14.100 --> 39:14.540]  Do you have an idea?
[39:14.680 --> 39:17.680]  Did you have an idea about future baseball or Time Machine Baseball?
[39:17.820 --> 39:20.840]  I had an idea about Time Machine Baseball, but I didn't talk about it with Gavin, I don't think.
[39:20.960 --> 39:24.640]  I was just saying we should put a bunch of different years of baseball games on a wheel and spin it.
[39:24.700 --> 39:28.700]  And then we have to play whichever one we land on and try to remember who's the good team and stuff that year.
[39:29.120 --> 39:30.580]  Could it go all the way back to the 90s?
[39:31.140 --> 39:33.000]  Yeah, it could go as far back as we want.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.540]  Go back to RBI Baseball on the NES if we want.
[39:36.840 --> 39:40.420]  I'll put it on the, uh, I'll put it on the list. I'll put it on the idea list.
[39:40.620 --> 39:45.280]  I was also thinking alternatively, if we wanted to get deep with it, we could pick a game like MLB that lets you do cu-
[39:45.280 --> 39:48.680]  This would be a lot of work, but you'd pick a game that lets you do custom teams.
[39:48.920 --> 39:53.240]  And then you spin a wheel and then you have to pick a team from that year in baseball.
[39:53.720 --> 39:57.400]  Maybe you spin a second wheel to figure out what team it is and then we just import that team into the game.
[39:57.400 --> 40:03.100]  So I could be the 72 Phillies while Eric's the 86 Padres and Gavin's the 2002 Mariners.
[40:03.180 --> 40:06.640]  That'd be crazy. That would take so long to get going and nobody would get it.
[40:06.780 --> 40:08.900]  No one, no one knows he's on the 2002 Mariners.
[40:09.160 --> 40:14.280]  It's one of those things that would be a lot cooler to do than to watch, probably, you know?
[40:14.580 --> 40:21.460]  But I think the idea of just spinning the wheel and having to pick, you know, RBI Baseball or King Griffey Junior Baseball or whatever and play that would be fun.
[40:21.740 --> 40:26.300]  I think that's a lot of fun. I'm looking at raccoons being vicious. They're scary.
[40:27.040 --> 40:29.420]  There's some intimidating raccoons out there.
[40:29.480 --> 40:33.060]  Oh wow, they got such flat teeth. You typically see them as like, kind of playful.
[40:33.540 --> 40:35.180]  Yeah, he could have fucked me up.
[40:35.640 --> 40:37.300]  He'd have come at me instead of going the other way.
[40:37.420 --> 40:38.940]  Oof, I don't know what I would have done.
[40:39.100 --> 40:40.280]  I might not be with us right now.
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.460]  I did search rage raccoon and uh...
[40:46.040 --> 40:47.860]  Yeah, yeah, kind of like that.
[40:48.360 --> 40:51.660]  There's something still funny about a raccoon yelling from a trash can.
[40:53.280 --> 40:55.880]  Even if it's supposed to be aggressive, there's something about it.
[40:55.880 --> 40:58.740]  That's just like, what the fuck are you doing over here?
[40:59.120 --> 41:00.160]  Why are you over here?
[41:00.880 --> 41:03.020]  This is mine. I live here.
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.020]  I'm waiting for a tattooed man to open this so I can scare him.
[41:07.840 --> 41:09.600]  Switching gears away from scary raccoons for a bit.
[41:09.720 --> 41:15.240]  Sure. I was streaming the other day and talking about how much fun the summer movie draft was in general.
[41:15.380 --> 41:18.260]  And somebody in the stream had a great idea.
[41:18.360 --> 41:20.580]  They said you guys should sell a popcorn.
[41:20.740 --> 41:22.680]  Like, what is the Gerpler popcorn bucket?
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.820]  Oh, popcorn buckets are hot right now.
[41:25.900 --> 41:26.660]  Because here's the thing.
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.680]  Here's the thing. You think, like, off the rip, you're like, oh, it's the Gerpler or whatever.
[41:33.180 --> 41:39.040]  But popcorn buckets are not shaped like they would hold popcorn anymore.
[41:39.060 --> 41:40.620]  They're very ineffective, typically.
[41:41.040 --> 41:41.360]  Yeah.
[41:41.900 --> 41:44.500]  Yeah, it's like the whole Sarlacc pit one that was a big deal.
[41:44.780 --> 41:48.640]  But they're doing like Darth Vader shit where it's like his helmet.
[41:48.860 --> 41:51.440]  And so you can get pretty out there with it.
[41:51.440 --> 41:53.960]  You can even get... hang on, let me send you this photo.
[41:54.600 --> 41:57.120]  It's not just popcorn bucket, which I think we should stick at.
[41:57.800 --> 42:00.920]  One that can hold soda? Very interesting to me.
[42:01.220 --> 42:03.480]  I've seen... yeah, I was curious how that worked.
[42:03.620 --> 42:08.620]  What movie coming out has one where it's... is it Defenders or whatever? That Marvel one?
[42:09.120 --> 42:09.560]  Thunderbolts?
[42:10.300 --> 42:10.740]  Thunderbolts.
[42:11.340 --> 42:15.320]  I think that one might have one that is a soda slash popcorn.
[42:15.860 --> 42:16.680]  What, like it's both?
[42:17.460 --> 42:18.360]  Yeah, I think so.
[42:18.360 --> 42:19.840]  We do have a Gerpler.
[42:20.020 --> 42:23.420]  And while I think it would be interesting to see what a Gerpler popcorn bucket would be,
[42:23.940 --> 42:26.300]  we also have a Port-a-Potty.
[42:26.300 --> 42:26.620]  Oh!
[42:28.400 --> 42:30.460]  Port-a-Potty is a great one.
[42:30.680 --> 42:30.880]  Yeah.
[42:31.340 --> 42:32.760]  Perfect popcorn bucket vessel.
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.860]  So since we are into... since we have the Wheel of Decades coming up,
[42:36.860 --> 42:39.120]  I don't know if that's come out yet or not, but I think it has, right?
[42:39.500 --> 42:43.120]  With where we have to watch the six episodes of Charmed 2018.
[42:43.740 --> 42:48.440]  And we've talked about indexing so heavily into like the summer movie stuff.
[42:48.840 --> 42:56.280]  Maybe it makes sense for us to investigate with El Famoso some sort of a Port-a-Potty themed popcorn bucket.
[42:56.460 --> 42:58.220]  Sending an email right now.
[42:58.520 --> 43:02.500]  Can it have a little toilet at the bottom for like one piece of popcorn to fall in?
[43:02.920 --> 43:06.080]  Dude, what if it's like a little... what if it's like a little butter fountain?
[43:06.240 --> 43:08.080]  You hit the button and it sprays out into the popcorn.
[43:11.120 --> 43:14.040]  Like a bidet for your popcorn. A butter bidet.
[43:16.060 --> 43:17.100]  Can you dye popcorn?
[43:17.860 --> 43:18.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[43:19.020 --> 43:19.500]  100%.
[43:19.500 --> 43:21.120]  Like pre... before it's popped?
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.640]  No. I don't think so.
[43:25.140 --> 43:26.600]  I think they do it after.
[43:27.140 --> 43:32.040]  I was wondering if I put like a kernel into just pure blue food dye, would it pop blue?
[43:32.360 --> 43:34.120]  Well, we have a kitchen. We can test it out, Gav.
[43:34.940 --> 43:36.800]  Let's soak some popcorn kernels.
[43:36.800 --> 43:40.860]  Yeah, I wonder if soaked kernels even pop though. Maybe after they dry out.
[43:41.240 --> 43:43.240]  We might have to soak and then dehydrate our kernels.
[43:43.920 --> 43:49.440]  That is why our office is a rented home, so we have access to a kitchen to try these things.
[43:50.220 --> 43:50.660]  100%.
[43:50.660 --> 43:52.180]  Kitchen, an important part.
[43:52.560 --> 43:54.380]  I'm thinking other popcorn bucket things we could do.
[43:54.520 --> 43:55.540]  We could do an Ian thing.
[43:56.120 --> 43:58.400]  I eat soda through the mouth.
[43:58.720 --> 44:01.320]  Ian is exactly... that's where my head went first, was Ian.
[44:01.620 --> 44:03.120]  I think the Ian thing is so good.
[44:03.120 --> 44:07.200]  That reminds me of the Wolverine one, is what I thought of.
[44:07.320 --> 44:09.480]  Where it's his big dumbass head or whatever.
[44:09.980 --> 44:10.840]  I don't think I've seen that one.
[44:11.240 --> 44:12.640]  Oh, you haven't? Hang on, hang on.
[44:13.580 --> 44:14.020]  It's this.
[44:14.260 --> 44:17.060]  It's supposed to be in reply to the Dune one.
[44:17.060 --> 44:18.360]  Oh, that looks sexual.
[44:18.880 --> 44:19.080]  Yeah.
[44:20.600 --> 44:24.640]  So it's that, and then you can put like, you know, it's popcorn.
[44:25.900 --> 44:28.560]  But an Ian one is a lot of fun.
[44:28.560 --> 44:33.580]  I'm emailing right now, exploring popcorn buckets, and we're thinking Port-a-Potty.
[44:34.620 --> 44:37.180]  So, I'll let you know when there's an update.
[44:37.540 --> 44:43.500]  I was a big fan of the Fast X popcorn bucket, which was just Vin Diesel's car.
[44:43.840 --> 44:51.320]  Really embracing the not at all a good mechanism for eating popcorn out of, but it just is absurd.
[44:51.780 --> 44:52.420]  Big fan!
[44:52.720 --> 44:58.200]  You just fucking lift up the top of his charger, and you put the popcorn in the car.
[44:59.520 --> 45:00.240]  That's awesome.
[45:00.420 --> 45:01.680]  That looks cool as hell, though.
[45:01.860 --> 45:02.680]  Yeah, it's great.
[45:02.900 --> 45:06.880]  Maybe we're popcorn bucket people. Maybe we can start collecting popcorn buckets.
[45:07.160 --> 45:09.200]  I'm definitely a popcorn bucket guy.
[45:09.580 --> 45:11.540]  I didn't realize I was, but I think I might be.
[45:12.080 --> 45:12.600]  I don't know.
[45:12.720 --> 45:13.420]  They get ridiculous.
[45:13.940 --> 45:14.480]  What are you eating, Nick?
[45:14.640 --> 45:15.740]  The dumber, the better.
[45:16.020 --> 45:16.540]  Yeah, I'm in.
[45:17.020 --> 45:22.580]  But when do you ever think, like, if you're ever eating popcorn out of a bowl, are you ever having a problem about that?
[45:22.800 --> 45:23.880]  No, it's great.
[45:24.120 --> 45:24.340]  What?
[45:24.340 --> 45:25.180]  What do you mean?
[45:25.440 --> 45:27.740]  I don't understand what you're saying.
[45:29.140 --> 45:29.740]  Me neither.
[45:30.600 --> 45:30.740]  What?
[45:31.180 --> 45:33.700]  Whenever I'm eating popcorn out of a bowl, it's perfectly fine.
[45:34.080 --> 45:34.420]  Yes.
[45:34.460 --> 45:38.160]  I don't need a specific thing for popcorn at any point.
[45:38.400 --> 45:41.800]  A lot of people felt that way before the Gurpler, too, and then they tried the Gurpler.
[45:42.140 --> 45:42.760]  Yeah, now what?
[45:43.340 --> 45:44.880]  Yeah, so now what, Gavin? Come on.
[45:45.720 --> 45:46.080]  Rebuttal?
[45:46.680 --> 45:47.120]  Yeah, thoughts?
[45:47.540 --> 45:50.220]  What if we all came up with our own popcorn buckets?
[45:50.660 --> 45:52.960]  Let's just try to get one, and then we can go.
[45:52.960 --> 45:56.620]  Yeah, but how do we know we're making the best one?
[45:56.920 --> 45:59.160]  Alright, well, my idea was the...
[45:59.840 --> 46:00.640]  Port-a-Potty.
[46:01.000 --> 46:02.900]  Yeah, gotta go with Nick.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.920]  Let's see how this one goes, and then we can go from there.
[46:05.860 --> 46:09.360]  What if we're all popcorn bucket people, but our audience are not?
[46:10.220 --> 46:12.400]  I'm definitely not a popcorn bucket person.
[46:12.940 --> 46:14.640]  It's like, I'm not at all.
[46:15.260 --> 46:16.840]  What if it was Snoopy, though?
[46:17.380 --> 46:19.800]  Alright, now maybe we're talking.
[46:20.200 --> 46:22.260]  You would eat out of Snoopy's scalped head?
[46:22.740 --> 46:22.940]  Yeah, I would eat out of Snoopy's scalped head.
[46:26.540 --> 46:29.120]  Yeah, I'd eat out of Snoopy's scalped head.
[46:30.000 --> 46:30.980]  That sounds good.
[46:31.800 --> 46:33.220]  Here, I'll send you this picture.
[46:33.940 --> 46:35.900]  You know who's a big popcorn bucket guy?
[46:36.300 --> 46:36.680]  Who?
[46:37.280 --> 46:38.840]  My very good friend Rocco.
[46:39.240 --> 46:41.340]  He loves the popcorn bucket.
[46:41.860 --> 46:46.200]  As evidenced by having about a dozen of them.
[46:46.220 --> 46:47.240]  He really does.
[46:47.240 --> 46:47.880]  Jesus Christ.
[46:48.060 --> 46:48.680]  Well, now this makes me...
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.100]  There are people who are super into the popcorn bucket.
[46:52.520 --> 46:52.720]  It is amazing.
[46:52.720 --> 46:52.920]  It is amazing.
[46:52.920 --> 46:55.700]  Rocco kind of sucks the fun out of this, doesn't he?
[46:55.800 --> 46:56.880]  Okay, cool. Awesome.
[46:57.220 --> 46:57.500]  Right on.
[46:58.200 --> 47:00.120]  That's the first time I've seen him look happy.
[47:00.680 --> 47:01.080]  Exactly.
[47:02.100 --> 47:03.540]  Have you ever seen that before?
[47:03.900 --> 47:06.320]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[47:06.680 --> 47:07.100]  There you go.
[47:08.940 --> 47:11.340]  Have you seen the Xenomorph one, Gavin?
[47:11.740 --> 47:12.040]  No.
[47:13.960 --> 47:15.280]  Imagine sitting in the theater,
[47:15.480 --> 47:16.920]  trying to eat your popcorn out of this.
[47:17.000 --> 47:19.100]  It's just a Xenomorph head.
[47:19.640 --> 47:21.140]  They didn't even use the mouth?
[47:21.140 --> 47:24.500]  No, it's the top of the head that they fill up.
[47:24.900 --> 47:26.480]  It is so long and bulky.
[47:26.600 --> 47:29.580]  It would be so uncomfortable to sit in a movie theater and eat that.
[47:29.940 --> 47:33.200]  Also, there's no way that the popcorn chamber is the entire length of that.
[47:33.600 --> 47:33.960]  No.
[47:34.680 --> 47:35.620]  You'd never get any out.
[47:35.960 --> 47:36.580]  It's a disaster.
[47:37.020 --> 47:37.840]  Dig that one, Eric.
[47:38.300 --> 47:39.020]  Oh, that's really cute.
[47:39.040 --> 47:40.400]  It's a Snoopy in his house.
[47:40.760 --> 47:43.020]  So you drink out of a long Snoopy,
[47:43.120 --> 47:45.440]  and then you're hanging out with a Woodstock eating corn.
[47:45.900 --> 47:46.860]  That's really cool.
[47:47.280 --> 47:49.660]  You think there's a way we could figure out
[47:49.660 --> 47:52.120]  a Rizzler sort of situation?
[47:53.960 --> 47:55.720]  I'm still waiting on Rizzle Tea,
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.240]  or whatever that was called.
[47:57.720 --> 48:00.380]  Oh yeah, that was the worst April Fool's joke,
[48:00.420 --> 48:01.140]  because I wanted it.
[48:01.400 --> 48:03.260]  Arizona Iced Tea. Arizona.
[48:04.120 --> 48:04.780]  I thought that was great.
[48:05.360 --> 48:06.620]  This is great. Honestly,
[48:07.420 --> 48:10.100]  Rizzler and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss
[48:10.100 --> 48:11.380]  should just do New Seinfeld.
[48:15.760 --> 48:16.860]  Rizzler is Kramer.
[48:18.080 --> 48:20.220]  That's exactly what I thought, too.
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.640]  Watch him burst in the door.
[48:21.800 --> 48:22.440]  That's fantastic.
[48:23.100 --> 48:24.480]  Is it Louise? I thought it was Louis.
[48:24.980 --> 48:26.080]  It's Louis, isn't it?
[48:26.080 --> 48:27.320]  All I know is it's Sevenier.
[48:28.240 --> 48:29.420]  It's definitely Sevenier.
[48:30.380 --> 48:31.780]  That's what we're trying to tell you.
[48:35.970 --> 48:37.690]  I am really curious
[48:37.690 --> 48:39.790]  how long the Rizzler's reign
[48:39.790 --> 48:41.550]  is going to be. I hope it's a long time.
[48:41.930 --> 48:43.250]  The Rizzler's reign?
[48:43.610 --> 48:45.730]  Do you think the Rizzler will last longer
[48:45.730 --> 48:47.110]  than Andy Milonakis did?
[48:47.110 --> 48:49.090]  Yes. Yeah, probably.
[48:49.730 --> 48:51.430]  But Andy Milonakis is still around.
[48:51.550 --> 48:54.030]  He's still doing stuff.
[48:54.330 --> 48:55.330]  I just heard him on
[48:55.330 --> 48:56.930]  Stavros World the other day.
[48:57.830 --> 48:58.470]  He's definitely kicking.
[49:00.250 --> 49:01.530]  Age is really...
[49:01.530 --> 49:03.410]  Much like Expedition 33,
[49:03.690 --> 49:05.490]  age is going to come for the Rizzler.
[49:05.670 --> 49:06.070]  Unfortunately.
[49:07.850 --> 49:08.670]  It's not the Patris.
[49:08.870 --> 49:09.830]  It's going to be puberty.
[49:10.110 --> 49:12.570]  It's going to really damage the Rizzler brand.
[49:13.030 --> 49:14.650]  You never know, though. It could be like that
[49:14.650 --> 49:16.010]  Neville Longbottom, dude.
[49:16.670 --> 49:18.670]  He turned into a fucking...
[49:18.670 --> 49:20.390]  Puberty turned him into a hunk.
[49:20.710 --> 49:22.650]  No, this isn't about appearance.
[49:22.810 --> 49:24.830]  I just think that so much of the Rizzler's appeal
[49:24.830 --> 49:25.870]  is how small he is.
[49:27.390 --> 49:29.030]  I think it's just his extreme
[49:29.030 --> 49:30.650]  charisma. You think so?
[49:31.090 --> 49:33.110]  I think it's the word
[49:33.110 --> 49:33.730]  Rizzler.
[49:34.170 --> 49:36.730]  It tickles my brain
[49:36.730 --> 49:38.770]  like the word
[49:38.770 --> 49:39.970]  wizard or lizard
[49:39.970 --> 49:42.390]  that I enjoy saying and hearing
[49:42.390 --> 49:44.450]  and I don't get tired of. I like hearing
[49:44.450 --> 49:46.750]  and saying the word Rizzler a lot.
[49:47.130 --> 49:48.730]  You just like Zeds. Zs.
[49:49.170 --> 49:50.470]  Yeah, I'm a big Zeds guy.
[49:51.250 --> 49:52.610]  Lord Zed. All of it.
[49:52.850 --> 49:54.590]  You would probably love saying Zizzler.
[49:54.850 --> 49:56.210]  You should name something Zizzler.
[49:56.510 --> 49:57.970]  Then you can just have a Z overload.
[49:58.470 --> 50:00.850]  What if Rizzler was at Sizzler? That should be
[50:00.850 --> 50:02.730]  an April Fool's thing is there's
[50:02.730 --> 50:03.670]  a Rizzler Sizzler.
[50:04.230 --> 50:04.730]  Write it down.
[50:06.110 --> 50:07.450]  What am I doing?
[50:08.310 --> 50:09.710]  I'll write it down.
[50:09.710 --> 50:12.370]  I just
[50:12.370 --> 50:14.730]  jot down Rizzler Sizzler real quick.
[50:15.070 --> 50:16.190]  For $5,000
[50:16.190 --> 50:17.970]  would you legally change your name to
[50:17.970 --> 50:20.110]  Zarek? I don't think so.
[50:21.690 --> 50:22.210]  No,
[50:22.350 --> 50:24.230]  not for $5,000. I think I'd rather
[50:24.230 --> 50:25.510]  wear a beret, you know what I mean?
[50:25.770 --> 50:26.330]  What about Erez?
[50:27.810 --> 50:30.290]  Erez is pretty good. That might be pretty good.
[50:30.430 --> 50:31.190]  E-R-I-Z?
[50:32.430 --> 50:34.070]  I wouldn't recommend doing bits
[50:34.070 --> 50:34.790]  around your name.
[50:35.690 --> 50:37.650]  Yeah, the name thing's tough.
[50:37.650 --> 50:39.490]  I just don't think you can do that.
[50:39.590 --> 50:42.130]  I think you gotta hang on to the name.
[50:42.610 --> 50:43.030]  It's tough.
[50:43.410 --> 50:45.710]  I don't know. I changed my name a bunch. It worked out okay for me.
[50:47.690 --> 50:48.570]  Is it
[50:48.570 --> 50:49.990]  Lazer with an S or a Z?
[50:50.510 --> 50:51.410]  With a Z.
[50:53.130 --> 50:53.890]  As we say
[50:53.890 --> 50:55.730]  in America. Rizzler Lazer.
[50:55.870 --> 50:57.490]  Lazer Rizzler. Sizzler.
[50:58.110 --> 50:58.890]  Lizard Wizard.
[51:00.290 --> 51:01.110]  Shut up.
[51:04.450 --> 51:06.050]  You just activate somebody?
[51:08.610 --> 51:09.410]  Hey, Andrew.
[51:09.590 --> 51:10.510]  How are we on strikes?
[51:11.390 --> 51:12.550]  I feel good about strikes.
[51:12.610 --> 51:13.850]  You guys made a ruling, right?
[51:14.630 --> 51:15.770]  Those two didn't count.
[51:16.310 --> 51:17.830]  I'm happy with whatever the ruling was.
[51:17.910 --> 51:18.850]  You got any new ones?
[51:19.270 --> 51:21.650]  No. Well, you.
[51:21.990 --> 51:23.190]  I had some from you.
[51:24.290 --> 51:26.470]  You're not really in the game too much.
[51:26.730 --> 51:28.370]  And you were sick. It was when you came
[51:28.370 --> 51:29.450]  back and you were sick.
[51:29.530 --> 51:31.750]  It was a lot. It was very understandable.
[51:32.190 --> 51:34.050]  Andrew asked me to upload some files
[51:34.050 --> 51:36.750]  and then I didn't. And then he reminded me I didn't upload them.
[51:37.010 --> 51:38.310]  Or I did and I uploaded the wrong ones.
[51:38.990 --> 51:40.390]  Gavin and I, when we were getting the TV,
[51:40.490 --> 51:42.450]  drove all the way to the house to upload a file for him
[51:42.450 --> 51:44.070]  and I still uploaded the wrong file.
[51:44.550 --> 51:45.730]  Wait, wait, wait. What?
[51:45.890 --> 51:48.750]  He drove all the way to your house and I stood in your living room
[51:48.750 --> 51:50.650]  for you to give him the wrong file?
[51:51.810 --> 51:52.650]  Apparently, yeah.
[51:54.330 --> 51:56.470]  Was it the same thing? I thought it was a different thing.
[51:56.830 --> 51:57.870]  Now, here's the thing.
[51:58.010 --> 52:00.390]  I know you're not in the strike game, Geoff, but I think maybe
[52:00.390 --> 52:01.230]  you have one now.
[52:02.290 --> 52:04.370]  I felt pretty bad about it.
[52:04.490 --> 52:05.390]  It was...
[52:05.390 --> 52:07.610]  Oh, that's my Geoff's strike idea.
[52:08.010 --> 52:08.950]  Oh, there you go.
[52:10.130 --> 52:11.410]  What's your Geoff's strike idea?
[52:11.730 --> 52:12.730]  My idea was,
[52:12.970 --> 52:15.590]  so the game is if I get 20 strikes, I have to eat that
[52:15.590 --> 52:16.450]  gross thing, right?
[52:17.570 --> 52:18.590]  Now, what if
[52:18.590 --> 52:21.790]  there's anyone that gets more strikes than me
[52:21.790 --> 52:23.250]  I just don't have to do it?
[52:23.470 --> 52:24.270]  I'm fine with that.
[52:24.870 --> 52:27.790]  And nothing happens to them, but I just don't have to do it?
[52:28.190 --> 52:29.190]  Yeah, I'm okay with that.
[52:29.710 --> 52:32.110]  Oh, wow, I was not expecting people to be okay with that.
[52:32.170 --> 52:33.470]  Well, I don't think there's any chance
[52:33.470 --> 52:34.130]  in hell it's going to happen.
[52:36.030 --> 52:36.750]  Well, okay.
[52:37.350 --> 52:38.630]  Well, I mean, Nick got one.
[52:39.010 --> 52:41.350]  If we're playing past...
[52:41.350 --> 52:41.790]  No.
[52:42.750 --> 52:43.110]  Sorry.
[52:44.950 --> 52:46.930]  I didn't mean knowing that. I was looking at...
[52:46.930 --> 52:49.070]  I was checking the file situation with Geoff and the strikes.
[52:49.830 --> 52:50.650]  They were two different things.
[52:50.750 --> 52:52.390]  So, Geoff, you uploaded the right thing
[52:53.390 --> 52:54.210]  at the time.
[52:54.870 --> 52:55.790]  We're all good with Gavin.
[52:55.790 --> 52:56.050]  Nice.
[52:56.490 --> 52:58.450]  I thought I had it wrong.
[52:59.190 --> 52:59.830]  I was so confused.
[53:00.430 --> 53:01.350]  I didn't...
[53:01.350 --> 53:06.210]  I got a text for
[53:06.210 --> 53:08.130]  it was the third repo video
[53:08.130 --> 53:10.010]  we did and I just took
[53:10.010 --> 53:11.950]  a screenshot of it because I didn't feel like
[53:11.950 --> 53:13.890]  trying to articulate what was described
[53:13.890 --> 53:15.650]  and I sent it to Geoff
[53:15.650 --> 53:16.670]  and the text is
[53:16.670 --> 53:19.150]  the video is a chicken horse gameplay
[53:19.150 --> 53:21.330]  and the audio is labeled right
[53:21.330 --> 53:23.050]  but I don't think it's the right file.
[53:25.610 --> 53:26.870]  So I thought I had
[53:26.870 --> 53:28.450]  uploaded a chicken horse video
[53:29.110 --> 53:30.930]  and then the wrong audio
[53:30.930 --> 53:32.510]  but named the right audio.
[53:33.010 --> 53:34.190]  Yeah, it was supposed to be a repo
[53:34.190 --> 53:35.430]  and you put in a chicken horse
[53:35.430 --> 53:37.670]  and you put in the wrong audio
[53:37.670 --> 53:39.270]  for that video as well.
[53:39.510 --> 53:42.350]  Yeah, it's all good now.
[53:42.770 --> 53:44.030]  I was getting really confused
[53:44.030 --> 53:45.890]  when I was trying to use my time machine
[53:45.890 --> 53:47.810]  to make sure I wouldn't get any past strikes.
[53:47.950 --> 53:48.930]  I was looking through some folders
[53:48.930 --> 53:51.910]  and Andrew has named so much of the Doomsday Heist
[53:51.910 --> 53:53.430]  Deadline. It's very confusing.
[53:54.430 --> 53:56.410]  Yeah, I think I just fucked up the name
[53:56.410 --> 53:57.610]  on that. That is totally me.
[53:57.870 --> 53:59.870]  I don't know why I thought it was Deadline.
[53:59.930 --> 54:01.570]  Deadline is the Tron game.
[54:02.310 --> 54:03.950]  Yes, I know it's from that
[54:03.950 --> 54:05.990]  but for some reason Deadline
[54:05.990 --> 54:08.110]  and Doomsday have merged into just being
[54:08.110 --> 54:09.970]  one thing. It's all Deadline.
[54:10.650 --> 54:12.350]  That explains a lot about some of the meetings
[54:12.350 --> 54:14.130]  we were having. Wait, so is that why
[54:14.130 --> 54:15.830]  you had Doomsday edited
[54:15.830 --> 54:17.290]  like 8 months early?
[54:17.950 --> 54:19.670]  Yeah. Did I say it was Deadline?
[54:20.210 --> 54:21.490]  Well, no, we were saying
[54:22.210 --> 54:23.790]  Deadline should come out and then you were
[54:23.790 --> 54:26.170]  working on heists that were like 8 videos
[54:26.170 --> 54:27.410]  ahead of where we were editing.
[54:27.770 --> 54:29.930]  Well, no, I was doing that because we had
[54:29.930 --> 54:31.910]  just done a GTA month and so I was
[54:31.910 --> 54:34.130]  trying to get us in a position where if we wanted
[54:34.130 --> 54:35.990]  to be able to do that, it would be
[54:35.990 --> 54:37.990]  easy to release. Well, you should probably have worked
[54:37.990 --> 54:40.130]  on the videos that were after the ones that were coming out.
[54:40.810 --> 54:41.910]  And not the ones 12
[54:41.910 --> 54:43.870]  from when... They were both being
[54:43.870 --> 54:46.190]  worked on simultaneously. Those were two different editors
[54:46.190 --> 54:47.350]  working on two different things.
[54:47.350 --> 54:49.530]  Yeah, but why would the second round
[54:49.530 --> 54:50.930]  of heists come out before the first?
[54:51.430 --> 54:53.690]  See, this is why Gavin needs to be in charge
[54:53.690 --> 54:55.610]  for whatever reason for the things
[54:55.610 --> 54:57.970]  he's saying that I'm not sure that I fully understand.
[54:58.390 --> 54:59.710]  I don't need to be in charge.
[55:00.090 --> 55:01.410]  Just Andrew shouldn't be in charge.
[55:02.730 --> 55:03.450]  I love...
[55:03.450 --> 55:05.590]  You know what? I think Andrew's doing a great job.
[55:05.670 --> 55:07.610]  I think he's doing a fantastic job. Andrew, don't
[55:07.610 --> 55:09.570]  listen to him. I think there's only one man up to
[55:09.570 --> 55:10.890]  the task and it sounds like it's Gavin.
[55:12.050 --> 55:13.610]  It's either Andrew or Gavin
[55:13.610 --> 55:14.510]  for me and that's it.
[55:14.510 --> 55:17.010]  That's it. Hey, Gavin, this whole...
[55:17.450 --> 55:19.150]  I don't know how this meandering conversation
[55:19.150 --> 55:20.730]  jogged this memory, but do you remember
[55:20.730 --> 55:22.710]  the game type we used to play in GTA
[55:22.710 --> 55:24.890]  where we were all on like platforms, kind of like
[55:24.890 --> 55:27.010]  Deadline, and then there'd be a circle
[55:27.010 --> 55:28.930]  you'd have to get to by a time limit
[55:28.930 --> 55:30.950]  and then the ground would start to fall away
[55:30.950 --> 55:32.750]  and then if you were outside the circle
[55:32.750 --> 55:34.690]  you'd blow up and everybody had to like cram
[55:34.690 --> 55:36.330]  into the circle. I remember the game.
[55:36.650 --> 55:38.510]  Do I remember the name? No. Oh, damn.
[55:38.610 --> 55:40.590]  I don't remember the name either, but if that's still around
[55:40.590 --> 55:42.490]  we should absolutely play that.
[55:42.490 --> 55:44.190]  I think that's where this
[55:44.190 --> 55:45.950]  Iron Monster truck came from.
[55:46.650 --> 55:48.730]  I think you were right, yeah. I think you're right.
[55:48.990 --> 55:50.950]  There's like not enough room for everybody in the circle
[55:50.950 --> 55:52.770]  and if anybody's car's out at all, they explode
[55:52.770 --> 55:54.130]  and you're just like... Oh, that sounds fun.
[55:54.910 --> 55:56.850]  We should play that. There's so many things
[55:56.850 --> 55:58.590]  in GTA we should play. Maybe somebody
[55:58.590 --> 56:00.110]  in the audience knows what it's called.
[56:00.710 --> 56:01.310]  Remind us.
[56:03.270 --> 56:04.850]  I'm still looking for my Fall Guys
[56:04.850 --> 56:06.710]  level. I'm still thinking about it.
[56:07.070 --> 56:08.810]  Has anyone in the community come across it, D-Day?
[56:09.890 --> 56:10.830]  I've had a few people
[56:10.830 --> 56:12.310]  reach out. I need to try one of them.
[56:13.130 --> 56:15.090]  But I don't think I'll ever
[56:15.090 --> 56:17.330]  find it again. I think it will evade me
[56:17.830 --> 56:19.250]  for the rest of time.
[56:20.490 --> 56:20.890]  Never know.
[56:21.770 --> 56:23.030]  Maybe try and get
[56:23.030 --> 56:25.250]  in contact with someone who works at that game
[56:25.250 --> 56:27.130]  company and see if it's tied
[56:27.130 --> 56:29.390]  to your account somehow. That's interesting.
[56:29.630 --> 56:30.590]  In your account history.
[56:31.110 --> 56:33.010]  Do you know what day you played it? I have no
[56:33.010 --> 56:35.070]  clue about that. But if they do a morning show
[56:35.070 --> 56:36.770]  would you be open to being on their morning show?
[56:37.690 --> 56:39.170]  Why would a game development
[56:39.170 --> 56:40.310]  company have a morning show?
[56:40.870 --> 56:43.350]  It's not for me to judge. I'm just saying if they do.
[56:43.710 --> 56:45.270]  You know how GTA had
[56:45.270 --> 56:46.950]  programming on the TVs in the game?
[56:48.090 --> 56:49.450]  I'm sure they do more than
[56:49.450 --> 56:51.430]  just Fall Guys. I'm sure they got a whole bunch of stuff
[56:51.430 --> 56:53.290]  going on out there. I'm just trying to reduce
[56:53.290 --> 56:55.590]  the steps for circling back around.
[56:56.070 --> 56:56.710]  They're already an in.
[56:57.210 --> 56:59.430]  I can email them and say, hey, I got a guy who's already
[56:59.430 --> 57:01.030]  ready to go. He's in. He's ready.
[57:01.390 --> 57:03.310]  Do you have a morning show? There is nothing
[57:03.310 --> 57:04.470]  better than an Andrew email.
[57:06.070 --> 57:06.590]  I'm scared.
[57:07.930 --> 57:08.950]  I'm just scared
[57:08.950 --> 57:10.290]  of what I'm going to end up committed to.
[57:10.510 --> 57:12.930]  You don't have to commit to anything. It's your call.
[57:13.430 --> 57:14.650]  I'm just presenting them to you.
[57:14.910 --> 57:16.950]  In terms of content, I should
[57:16.950 --> 57:19.050]  probably be saying yes to all of it.
[57:19.370 --> 57:19.890]  You don't have to.
[57:20.330 --> 57:21.490]  Do you think...
[57:22.910 --> 57:24.930]  What do you mean saying yes
[57:24.930 --> 57:25.590]  to all of it?
[57:27.530 --> 57:28.810]  Just anything that comes
[57:28.810 --> 57:30.730]  your way here? Yeah. Andrew's
[57:30.730 --> 57:32.690]  taking the time out of his schedule
[57:32.690 --> 57:33.650]  to become my agent.
[57:33.650 --> 57:35.990]  I don't want to waste his time.
[57:36.270 --> 57:37.870]  That makes me nervous.
[57:39.590 --> 57:40.390]  That also
[57:40.390 --> 57:42.470]  makes me nervous as well.
[57:42.610 --> 57:44.290]  I now need to be more selective
[57:44.290 --> 57:45.810]  in what...
[57:45.810 --> 57:48.030]  If I have a safeguard of him saying
[57:48.030 --> 57:49.770]  he's certainly going to say no to this,
[57:49.850 --> 57:51.730]  but if that's gone, then that changes
[57:51.730 --> 57:53.970]  things for how I would approach this.
[57:54.190 --> 57:55.450]  We're basically going to end up playing
[57:55.830 --> 57:56.810]  publicity chicken.
[57:57.390 --> 57:58.290]  I guess so.
[58:00.190 --> 58:01.630]  Are you a
[58:01.630 --> 58:03.490]  regulation listener
[58:03.490 --> 58:05.390]  or comment leaver who works at a local
[58:05.390 --> 58:06.810]  or regional morning show?
[58:07.390 --> 58:07.870]  Please!
[58:10.410 --> 58:11.690]  It's gotta be Canadian.
[58:12.070 --> 58:13.230]  I just want
[58:13.730 --> 58:15.430]  some Nova Scotia
[58:16.230 --> 58:17.190]  TV station.
[58:17.770 --> 58:19.430]  Are you less likely to
[58:19.430 --> 58:21.550]  criticize your own nation's morning show, Andrew?
[58:21.850 --> 58:23.590]  No, I would equally criticize it
[58:23.590 --> 58:25.050]  because I think you're better than it.
[58:25.970 --> 58:27.170]  You're better than Canada?
[58:27.390 --> 58:28.610]  You think Gavin's better than Canada?
[58:28.610 --> 58:30.850]  I think he's better than morning show appearances.
[58:31.790 --> 58:32.610]  Even the Today
[58:32.610 --> 58:32.970]  Show?
[58:33.890 --> 58:34.870]  That's a big one.
[58:35.010 --> 58:38.610]  I think that is the ultimate one.
[58:38.990 --> 58:40.590]  If you're on the Today Show, you better
[58:40.590 --> 58:42.310]  say the name of this fucking podcast, man.
[58:43.810 --> 58:44.250]  Please.
[58:44.570 --> 58:45.770]  I'm begging you. Please.
[58:46.330 --> 58:48.090]  You better be eating out of that popcorn bucket.
[58:48.490 --> 58:50.030]  Yeah, because if you're on the Today Show
[58:50.030 --> 58:52.330]  and you don't promote us, tomorrow's going to be
[58:52.330 --> 58:53.550]  the owl show for you.
[58:55.050 --> 58:56.550]  What are you damn saying?
[58:56.550 --> 58:56.810]  What?
[59:03.430 --> 59:04.510]  It's going to be
[59:04.510 --> 59:06.510]  the owl show.
[59:06.510 --> 59:08.650]  What would the intro to the owl show sound like?
[59:09.310 --> 59:09.750]  Ow!
[59:10.550 --> 59:12.310]  Don't mention us on the Today Show
[59:12.310 --> 59:12.890]  and find out.
[59:15.610 --> 59:16.610]  Oh, I've got...
[59:16.610 --> 59:17.910]  I've got a show idea.
[59:18.110 --> 59:20.370]  But there's no conversion. We've already talked about it.
[59:20.590 --> 59:20.790]  What?
[59:21.270 --> 59:25.070]  Right, but it's something I can show my mom
[59:25.070 --> 59:26.410]  and she knows what that is.
[59:26.810 --> 59:28.330]  Well, I might as well get them to say,
[59:28.690 --> 59:29.610]  Hello Eric Baudour.
[59:30.270 --> 59:31.810]  Okay, get them to do that.
[59:32.050 --> 59:34.150]  It just seems like it maybe would be more productive
[59:34.150 --> 59:36.630]  if it was the podcast, but yeah, just have them say my name.
[59:36.690 --> 59:37.190]  That's fine too.
[59:37.290 --> 59:40.470]  For the first time, we're brand safe, Gavin.
[59:40.950 --> 59:42.090]  For the first time ever.
[59:42.770 --> 59:45.270]  What's funnier, listen to the regulation podcast
[59:45.270 --> 59:46.470]  or Hello Eric's Mom.
[59:47.350 --> 59:49.590]  Dude, if it was Hello Eric's Mom,
[59:49.670 --> 59:50.570]  that would be pretty cool.
[59:51.430 --> 59:52.950]  She wouldn't know what's going on.
[59:52.950 --> 59:53.730]  That's pretty exciting.
[59:55.090 --> 59:56.970]  I have a show I want to pitch
[59:56.970 --> 59:57.790]  doing with you, Gavin.
[59:58.410 --> 59:59.630]  That has been in my head.
[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.310]  There's part of me that wants to,
[01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.950]  I'd love to just surprise the rest of the guys
[01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:06.770]  doing this, but I also really want to hear
[01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.850]  your reaction to the pitch.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:10.270]  It's called
[01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:11.850]  Behind the Mask,
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:14.730]  and it's a podcast with you and I
[01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:16.930]  trying to talk through having our
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:19.010]  CPAPs on at the same time
[01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.810]  wearing our masks and communicating.
[01:00:20.810 --> 01:00:22.790]  I was doing
[01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:24.870]  this in bed the other night where I was trying to
[01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.770]  say sentences with my mask,
[01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.250]  and it's really difficult because it's
[01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:31.070]  blasting air through your nostrils
[01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:32.670]  into your throat when you talk.
[01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.130]  It is not easy to do,
[01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.470]  and it made me a very gassy boy
[01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:38.230]  after I did it for quite a while.
[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.590]  It's all aired up, but I think
[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.210]  doing a little mini supplemental,
[01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:44.410]  you and I trying to conduct a podcast
[01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:46.550]  with our masks on
[01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.150]  and while wearing them
[01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:49.470]  could be pretty good.
[01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.290]  For me, it just sounds like very short, nasally
[01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:54.050]  sentences, followed by
[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:55.390]  like...
[01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:56.890]  That's what it sounds like for me.
[01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:58.870]  I think that would be very funny.
[01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.250]  Why don't we debut a segment on the next
[01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:03.990]  regulation? We'll just have a two-minute chat
[01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:05.830]  with our PAPs.
[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.570]  I think it's a great idea.
[01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:09.710]  This is such an innovative idea.
[01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:11.690]  We need to take this straight to the morning shows.
[01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:12.630]  They're going to love it.
[01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.970]  CPAPs are a hot-button issue right now,
[01:01:15.970 --> 01:01:17.690]  and it's going to be perfect for their audience.
[01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:19.670]  I've noted in my
[01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:22.230]  notes that next week
[01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.270]  or next
[01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.650]  episode, Behind the Mask,
[01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.110]  so that way when we get into it, we'll know right away.
[01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.910]  I love it.
[01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:30.270]  Lug all that shit into my office.
[01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.970]  I was thinking, do they
[01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:34.890]  make extension cords for CPAPs?
[01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:36.710]  They must, right? What's the longest
[01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:38.270]  CPAP hose I can get?
[01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.290]  I don't think the hose
[01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:42.050]  can be that long.
[01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.930]  Can I have just an insanely long hose?
[01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.710]  Would that work?
[01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:49.610]  You'd just be breathing hose air.
[01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:51.910]  I feel like I'm already breathing
[01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:52.470]  hose air.
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.230]  Let me look up.
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.070]  They make travel
[01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:59.630]  PAPs. They sure do.
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:00.910]  They're portable, right?
[01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.530]  USB ones for planes.
[01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:05.490]  Do they call it a TPAP
[01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:07.110]  extender? I think so.
[01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.110]  They should. How long can I get these?
[01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.110]  CPAP extension
[01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.890]  hose? Doesn't seem
[01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:15.390]  like they're too absurdly long.
[01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.290]  I wonder if there's a group PAP.
[01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:19.810]  That is
[01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:21.910]  a nightmare. Can you get one machine for like six hoses?
[01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:23.630]  Like a hookah? Kind of.
[01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:26.050]  Like the dreaming machine
[01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:26.830]  in Deception.
[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:30.070]  There doesn't seem to be a product
[01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:31.350]  that is what I want.
[01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.850]  Like a six foot CPAP
[01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:35.610]  hose. Do you think you could build
[01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:36.610]  the GPAP, Gavin?
[01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:39.130]  That's interesting.
[01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.930]  I bet I could build a GPAP.
[01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.630]  I just need to reverse engineer
[01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.470]  a regular PAP.
[01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:47.630]  What do I need? A little air compressor?
[01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:49.790]  A little humidifier? Probably not much else.
[01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:51.790]  Some hoses. A couple
[01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:52.910]  of J-Bends.
[01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:55.470]  Oh, a ten foot extra long hose.
[01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:57.810]  When was the last time you bought a J-Bend?
[01:02:58.330 --> 01:02:59.550]  That was with you, I believe.
[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:03.810]  We're very cyclical.
[01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.950]  We've done the TV again. It could be
[01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:07.790]  that our next trip might be
[01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.010]  for a J-Bend. How are your sinks holding up?
[01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:12.050]  I mean, it's a rental, so I don't give a shit.
[01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:15.850]  We'll have to see how the dump rooms in the office
[01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.030]  hold up. I am excited
[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.330]  for us to get the office finalized.
[01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.970]  Although, by this time it comes out,
[01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:23.430]  it will have been done by now.
[01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:26.030]  We're in season two.
[01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.910]  What an entrance into season two.
[01:03:28.570 --> 01:03:29.990]  CPAP masks, hoses,
[01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.090]  popcorn buckets. I'm excited
[01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.290]  to see what this year brings. Blindsides.
[01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:35.530]  That's true.
[01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:38.010]  It's been a hell of a season already. We're only an hour
[01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.990]  and 15 minutes into it. I thought about
[01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.070]  using my blindside to blindside
[01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:44.110]  us back to what we were going to do before we got
[01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:44.670]  blindsided.
[01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:48.350]  Whoa. That's a nefarious
[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:50.230]  way to use a blindside. I never considered that.
[01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.130]  Imagine if we started this podcast
[01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.130]  and then I said blindside to play Wormsome again.
[01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:55.030]  Wow.
[01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:57.030]  Would that be allowed?
[01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:58.870]  I guess.
[01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.350]  I just never thought about using a blindside for good.
[01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:10.130]  My
[01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:11.750]  blindsides are educational.
[01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.910]  Yeah, sure. Your blindsides
[01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:15.230]  fill me with dread.
[01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:18.210]  Littlest Hobo is pretty good.
[01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.210]  That was great. I learned about Canadian
[01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:21.850]  culture. Nick, have you ever done one?
[01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:24.230]  No! I need to think of one.
[01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:26.230]  Yeah, you two need to use them.
[01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:27.950]  They're a lot of fun. Yeah, they are
[01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.890]  real fun. So we get two
[01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.970]  a year, right? A video game one and then a
[01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:32.930]  TV game one. Video game and live action.
[01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.410]  So I got a video game blindside.
[01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.290]  Two a year is nuts. That's
[01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.470]  ten blindsides a year. Well, not really.
[01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.450]  It's more like five because
[01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.330]  you don't really use yours. Nick isn't using
[01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.390]  yours. Chances are great
[01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.410]  that I won't use a video game blindside. I can't even
[01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:48.150]  imagine what I would do.
[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:50.590]  I'm scared if you do.
[01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:51.950]  Are there any AIDS games?
[01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:55.270]  We should end this show.
[01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.090]  Well, there you go.
[01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:59.310]  This is the end of the beginning
[01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:01.570]  of season two. After this,
[01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.210]  we're just in it.
[01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.030]  It's just in
[01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:06.770]  season two. Thanks for
[01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:09.170]  watching for the first year. Maybe
[01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:11.270]  continue to watch into the next year
[01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:13.270]  and then each subsequent year after that.
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.630]  And
[01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:17.430]  we really do appreciate it. Give us stars.
[01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:19.350]  Oh, you know what? We have mail
[01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.030]  now. You can send us mail if you want to.
[01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:23.210]  Our address is PO Box 13146
[01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:25.210]  Care of Regulation
[01:05:25.210 --> 01:05:27.210]  Company, Austin, Texas 78701.
[01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.290]  I'm not saying it twice.
[01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:31.290]  Thank you very much. Have you
[01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.030]  measured it? I haven't measured what?
[01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.930]  The PO Box? Yes.
[01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:37.130]  Yeah, I know. Right when we first
[01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:39.210]  started, we did. We have some stuff
[01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.910]  that we need to open and all that.
[01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:42.330]  So what's the size of it?
[01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.690]  It's like bigger than a bread box.
[01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:46.950]  Bigger than a bread box.
[01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:49.430]  Do you need the actual dimensions?
[01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:50.770]  No, I just...
[01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.830]  People can't send anything bigger than bread.
[01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:55.190]  The size is
[01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.210]  a size four. It's 11 inches by
[01:05:57.210 --> 01:05:59.670]  11 inches. Oh, that's
[01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.670]  bigger than bread. Yeah, but...
[01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:03.890]  I said it was bigger than a bread box, but...
[01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:05.750]  Also, if somebody mails
[01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.710]  you something bigger than your PO Box, it doesn't
[01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.550]  just get returned for being too large.
[01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:11.630]  They just put a yellow sheet of paper
[01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:13.510]  in your PO Box that says
[01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.710]  go to the window and ask for this package
[01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.610]  and they give it to you. Do they get mingy
[01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:19.650]  about that? Do they charge you extra for that?
[01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:21.730]  No, they don't get
[01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.190]  mingy or charge you extra.
[01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:25.550]  Only if you ask for cheese. Yeah.
[01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:27.450]  I just put
[01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.430]  aids in the Microsoft store and
[01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:31.170]  you get a Gundam update
[01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:33.470]  for some reason. Gundam
[01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:35.350]  Battle Alliance. In the
[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:37.430]  films category, you get a movie called
[01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.350]  Band Aid and
[01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.530]  The Golf Doctor. First
[01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.990]  aid for your game.
[01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:45.650]  Definitely something to think about for future Blindsides.
[01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.310]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:48.990]  We'll see you next week. Bye!
[01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:49.850]  Bye!
