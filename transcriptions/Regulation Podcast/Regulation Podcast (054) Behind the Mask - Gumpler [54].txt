[00:00.000 --> 00:05.040]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 54.
[00:05.420 --> 00:09.480]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, and with me as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz,
[00:09.540 --> 00:13.900]  and Eric Baudour. Gavin, you were going to explain the behind the mask thing.
[00:14.580 --> 00:26.620]  Behind the mask, right, was obviously about Nick and the faces he makes behind the mask.
[00:30.860 --> 00:34.540]  That doesn't sound right. Uh, does anybody have any memory
[00:34.540 --> 00:37.540]  of what behind the mask means and why we wrote that note down?
[00:37.580 --> 00:39.940]  You don't remember behind the mask?
[00:41.380 --> 00:46.400]  Oh, were we going to do an episode where it was being, we're in the CPAP machine?
[00:47.140 --> 00:50.140]  Gavin and I are doing a CPAP episode, or segment.
[00:51.880 --> 00:56.900]  In the CPAP, we're behind the mask, trying to talk with the CPAP on.
[00:57.460 --> 01:02.640]  Un-unlistenable. I think I sound great!
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.980]  Now I know why Andrew took a while to get ready.
[01:12.860 --> 01:18.340]  Set up behind the mask, a show with Gavin and I. This is a little teaser.
[01:19.460 --> 01:23.060]  He sounds like Stephen Hawking at the bottom of a flight of stairs.
[01:23.260 --> 01:24.120]  Yeah, it's pretty horrible.
[01:26.900 --> 01:30.020]  And then to bring you behind the mask!
[01:34.660 --> 01:37.260]  Is that what you sound like behind your mask?
[01:37.660 --> 01:41.840]  I don't think I sound the same. So I should drag mine in here,
[01:41.920 --> 01:43.600]  maybe right at the end, right? And we'll have a conversation.
[01:44.060 --> 01:45.440]  Yeah, if you want. Yeah, we can.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.220]  Yeah. And that was sort of the point, but...
[01:48.220 --> 01:49.760]  Yeah, yeah. I just, I forgot the bit.
[01:52.720 --> 01:56.720]  How apropos that I threw it to you randomly then, uh, in the first place.
[01:57.880 --> 01:58.720]  How are you guys doing?
[01:59.460 --> 02:00.600]  Good! How are you doing, buddy?
[02:01.040 --> 02:05.900]  I'm doing really good. Way better now that I'm masked off. Masked on and talking, not great.
[02:07.700 --> 02:09.680]  I, uh, I have an update on the serial killer.
[02:10.120 --> 02:11.300]  You have an update on the serial killer?
[02:12.400 --> 02:16.100]  Yeah. Last time I talked to you guys, I told you that a raccoon jumped out at me
[02:16.100 --> 02:19.780]  and the trash can scared me to holy hell. And it was like a big, meaty motherfucker.
[02:20.220 --> 02:23.760]  And I thought, it looks like he's, he's housing a lot of dead animals in there.
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.520]  But I don't know, man, the more I think about it, I just don't know how he catches birds, right?
[02:28.860 --> 02:34.460]  Like that doesn't make any sense to me. Birds are so fast. But, uh, two days ago,
[02:34.460 --> 02:38.780]  I went outside and I found the back half of a bird in my front yard.
[02:38.920 --> 02:39.580]  Oh, no.
[02:39.980 --> 02:43.900]  Yeah. Like the ass and the legs and the tail and the back tail. Yeah.
[02:44.600 --> 02:47.520]  I have no idea what happened to the wings and the head.
[02:48.020 --> 02:51.240]  I mean, I have a pretty good idea they're in something else, but, uh, yeah,
[02:51.240 --> 02:54.440]  they didn't want the butt. So they left the butt for me. I had to throw that away.
[02:55.000 --> 02:58.900]  I thought that'd be where all the good stuff is on a bird, like the wings down.
[02:59.380 --> 03:03.800]  You would think so. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know why, what caused this animal to only eat
[03:04.220 --> 03:11.700]  half of a perfectly good bird. But, uh, yeah, it, uh, still seems to be an active crime zone,
[03:11.840 --> 03:12.280]  my yard.
[03:12.480 --> 03:13.760]  I think you got to put a camera out there.
[03:14.560 --> 03:18.240]  I'm scared to see. There was, yeah. Yeah. I think you're right. And unfortunately,
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.300]  but I'm scared to get the footage.
[03:19.300 --> 03:24.080]  Or, or forget like a security camera. We'll just, we'll, um, build one of those little hides
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.900]  with a camo all over it. And we'll just sit in there and eat lunch and film.
[03:31.240 --> 03:33.300]  We could, we could do that. Yeah.
[03:33.840 --> 03:35.420]  I guess it's not happening at lunchtime.
[03:35.660 --> 03:37.100]  Are chicken wings all wings?
[03:37.760 --> 03:38.340]  As opposed to what?
[03:38.720 --> 03:42.820]  Well, the, the, you know, there's like when you order chicken wings, there's two types of wing,
[03:43.280 --> 03:44.060]  generally speaking.
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.160]  What left and right?
[03:45.480 --> 03:49.060]  Yeah. Well, yeah, that's how I divide them up. That's how I split.
[03:49.300 --> 03:53.240]  I personally prefer the left. It's, I think, a better quality meat than the right.
[03:54.500 --> 03:58.720]  But there's like a drumstick. It's like wings and a drumstick. And obviously the wing meat.
[03:58.860 --> 04:02.440]  I know that is by the bones. What's where's the, the drum part coming?
[04:03.040 --> 04:05.480]  Leg. Yeah. It's the thigh and the leg.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.920]  Huh? That's not really a wing.
[04:08.360 --> 04:11.820]  Are you talking about like the flat in the wing? What do you?
[04:12.260 --> 04:15.900]  Yeah. So there's two types. There's the, I think flat is the one I'm thinking that's
[04:15.900 --> 04:21.480]  very wing-like and then there's sort of like the bone, the drumstick kind of.
[04:21.580 --> 04:23.640]  Oh, so you're just talking about like a cut up wing?
[04:24.580 --> 04:28.280]  Yeah. Is that, is the drumette? Oh, okay.
[04:28.680 --> 04:31.360]  So it's like the, it's like shoulder to elbow.
[04:32.020 --> 04:35.140]  So it's like a shoulder blade bone meat.
[04:36.920 --> 04:40.080]  So it's like forearm and shoulder blade is a chicken wing.
[04:40.360 --> 04:44.320]  This is not going to be our thumbnail. We need to talk about different stuff in this episode.
[04:44.320 --> 04:46.980]  We had gleeking around like in the last one that came out.
[04:47.140 --> 04:48.780]  I'm not going to make that our thumbnail either.
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.460]  There's still plenty of time to not, that doesn't have to be the thumbnail. It's fine.
[04:52.620 --> 04:54.340]  It's fine. I'm not, yeah.
[04:54.720 --> 04:57.300]  Picture a raw chicken meat for the audience.
[04:57.820 --> 04:58.760]  What do we do with the tip?
[04:59.520 --> 05:02.320]  Uh, probably use it for like stock or something.
[05:02.440 --> 05:03.200]  Okay. Yeah.
[05:03.700 --> 05:05.080]  Feed it to a dog, you know?
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.960]  Oh, a dog would love the tip.
[05:08.260 --> 05:09.880]  I don't like, I don't like that.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.380]  Dogs love chicken bones and they're real, they're real good for dogs too.
[05:13.380 --> 05:16.180]  It's just a great meaty tip.
[05:17.120 --> 05:19.440]  So the bones are actually good for the dog.
[05:19.960 --> 05:21.320]  I think it helps with the teeth, right?
[05:21.700 --> 05:24.040]  No, no. Dogs aren't supposed to eat chicken bones.
[05:24.400 --> 05:25.580]  No, they can before they're cooked.
[05:26.040 --> 05:26.820]  Yes, that's true.
[05:28.280 --> 05:31.500]  Nick is, Nick is technically correct. You can eat them before, uh, I don't know why I said
[05:31.500 --> 05:34.860]  technically correct. He's 100% correct. You can eat them. Yeah, you can eat them before they're
[05:34.860 --> 05:36.620]  cooked. But why are they worthless cooked?
[05:37.100 --> 05:38.420]  Uh, because the bone can splinter.
[05:38.620 --> 05:43.300]  Yeah, the bone gets real malleable and it can fuck a dog's mouth or throw it up real
[05:43.300 --> 05:45.040]  bad. Yeah, they can choke real bad.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.040]  But don't dogs chew the big bones because of like their teeth? Isn't that a positive?
[05:49.580 --> 05:50.260]  Different bones.
[05:50.660 --> 05:53.160]  Yeah, I understand different bones, but I'm just saying that's,
[05:53.540 --> 05:56.260]  that's the incentive of the bone chew, right? Like it helps their teeth.
[05:56.960 --> 05:57.040]  Yeah.
[05:57.360 --> 06:00.720]  Why don't we have a bone equivalent as a human? I want to chew on something.
[06:01.280 --> 06:04.100]  We do. You could, you could go to a restaurant and get like,
[06:04.680 --> 06:08.180]  get a like, we, there's a place in Austin that has bone tallow tacos.
[06:09.440 --> 06:12.420]  Is it just like a giant bone I could bite into?
[06:12.420 --> 06:15.340]  What is bones for people? Let's see.
[06:15.520 --> 06:18.000]  Like just something I can gnaw on that helps my teeth.
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.100]  What do people gnaw on?
[06:20.200 --> 06:21.160]  Brushing is boring.
[06:21.840 --> 06:23.840]  Oh, you want a greenie for a person?
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.540]  I don't know what that means.
[06:25.920 --> 06:28.600]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He wants a people. Oh, dude.
[06:29.500 --> 06:30.840]  He wants a human Kong.
[06:31.420 --> 06:33.640]  Yeah, I do. That's exactly what I want.
[06:33.920 --> 06:38.440]  It's true. Unfortunately, I have an answer on something that you can gnaw on,
[06:38.520 --> 06:40.040]  but you're not going to like it. Let's see.
[06:40.040 --> 06:42.420]  Oh, it's a pencil.
[06:44.660 --> 06:45.800]  Listen, listen.
[06:46.520 --> 06:51.520]  I searched what can people gnaw on and broken pencil, the pencil thing, this showed up.
[06:51.600 --> 06:52.960]  I'm just letting you know.
[06:53.200 --> 06:58.220]  We are about to annoy a lot of audience when I make that the thumbnail for episode 50.
[06:59.320 --> 07:01.560]  Holy shit, you finally ate the pencil.
[07:01.900 --> 07:03.040]  You're crazy.
[07:03.380 --> 07:03.880]  Never happened.
[07:03.980 --> 07:04.980]  You can't stop me.
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.300]  Speaking of the pencil, Shaheen still killing it in Survivor.
[07:10.380 --> 07:11.760]  He's in the final six.
[07:12.060 --> 07:14.500]  I haven't watched this week's episode, but thank you for letting me know.
[07:14.600 --> 07:15.020]  No problem.
[07:16.120 --> 07:16.840]  Final six.
[07:18.420 --> 07:19.140]  God, great.
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.160]  It's not my fault.
[07:20.260 --> 07:20.920]  You didn't watch it.
[07:21.560 --> 07:24.660]  I know, and I could have communicated that to you ahead of time to it.
[07:25.200 --> 07:26.180]  He's doing fantastic.
[07:26.620 --> 07:27.720]  We're almost at the finale.
[07:28.460 --> 07:30.560]  Two more episodes and we're there.
[07:30.980 --> 07:31.640]  He's killing it.
[07:32.260 --> 07:33.820]  Yeah, he's and he's a lot of fun to watch.
[07:33.820 --> 07:35.120]  He's a really likable, personal guy.
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.140]  He's so much fun to watch.
[07:36.780 --> 07:45.200]  I have a clip to play because this show filled with ridiculous coincidences.
[07:46.380 --> 07:50.660]  You know, just the fact that Shaheen is on Survivor after being our pencil judge of all
[07:50.660 --> 07:52.260]  things is nuts.
[07:53.220 --> 07:59.440]  He recently made a TikTok about how to properly pronounce his name and there's something in
[07:59.440 --> 08:00.580]  it that blew my mind.
[08:00.800 --> 08:01.640]  I couldn't believe this.
[08:01.840 --> 08:02.700]  I'm going to play this really quick.
[08:03.820 --> 08:08.280]  I've had a couple people ask me how to say my name, and I love that people want to take
[08:08.280 --> 08:11.580]  the care to get my name right, especially because it is such a cool name.
[08:11.940 --> 08:15.520]  My name means Royal White Falcon.
[08:15.820 --> 08:16.260]  Could you imagine?
[08:17.360 --> 08:17.880]  What?
[08:18.700 --> 08:21.000]  Shaheen's name means Falcon.
[08:21.740 --> 08:21.900]  What?
[08:21.900 --> 08:23.540]  That's fucking crazy.
[08:24.080 --> 08:25.960]  He's the most regulation human.
[08:26.120 --> 08:26.860]  He's a falcon.
[08:26.980 --> 08:28.460]  He's a regulation guy.
[08:28.780 --> 08:29.140]  Wow.
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.160]  The universe is trying to tell this guy to be our friend, and I bet he will not listen.
[08:34.280 --> 08:35.500]  But goddamn, man.
[08:35.660 --> 08:36.200]  Well, no, no.
[08:36.260 --> 08:36.760]  Here's the thing.
[08:36.840 --> 08:38.100]  So I've been talking to Shaheen.
[08:38.180 --> 08:39.340]  I've been going back and forth.
[08:39.400 --> 08:40.120]  I've been messing with him.
[08:40.120 --> 08:40.260]  Oh, good.
[08:41.160 --> 08:44.000]  And I let him know about the Falcon connection.
[08:44.340 --> 08:45.020]  That blew his mind.
[08:45.220 --> 08:46.740]  He really wants some Falcon merch.
[08:46.920 --> 08:48.580]  I was showing our Protected by Falcon sign.
[08:48.740 --> 08:48.900]  Okay.
[08:49.200 --> 08:49.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[08:49.480 --> 08:51.300]  He's now on the Patreon.
[08:51.840 --> 08:53.140]  I gifted him a subscription.
[08:53.540 --> 08:55.040]  He is a Protected by Falcon.
[08:55.680 --> 08:56.700]  He's in the mix.
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.100]  He's very excited about it.
[08:58.100 --> 08:59.040]  Oh, man, that's awesome.
[08:59.140 --> 09:01.020]  He's not going to change his ruling, though.
[09:01.540 --> 09:02.820]  No, I'm fine with the ruling.
[09:03.000 --> 09:04.020]  I've accepted the ruling.
[09:04.640 --> 09:05.500]  All good with the ruling.
[09:05.800 --> 09:07.260]  But just that, I couldn't believe that.
[09:07.400 --> 09:07.740]  I have.
[09:08.520 --> 09:11.800]  I haven't paid the consequence of the ruling, but I've accepted it.
[09:11.840 --> 09:12.640]  I'm not fighting it.
[09:13.220 --> 09:13.580]  Really?
[09:13.920 --> 09:17.360]  It's like somebody committed a crime and they're like, yeah, I should go to jail,
[09:17.400 --> 09:19.080]  but I'm not going yet.
[09:19.120 --> 09:19.960]  But I should.
[09:20.520 --> 09:20.820]  You're right.
[09:21.120 --> 09:24.660]  That person was also saying, hey, when's this other guy going to wear the red boots?
[09:24.820 --> 09:25.780]  Why haven't you done it yet?
[09:26.300 --> 09:26.480]  What?
[09:29.700 --> 09:30.400]  What do you mean?
[09:31.000 --> 09:32.520]  I know what Gavin's talking about.
[09:32.680 --> 09:35.100]  Are you saying I'm the only person that's demanding that?
[09:35.480 --> 09:39.480]  I just think for a guy who needs to eat an entire pencil, you're pretty heavy on the boots thing.
[09:39.940 --> 09:43.000]  Well, it's just because I want us to be able to release season two of the show.
[09:43.220 --> 09:44.320]  Yeah, I want you to eat the pencil.
[09:44.780 --> 09:47.720]  Yeah, but there's not a season of content behind the pencil.
[09:49.220 --> 09:50.180]  I'm not holding up.
[09:50.400 --> 09:53.360]  There's not pencil two that we need to do around the corner.
[09:54.040 --> 09:55.820]  It's just pencil one.
[09:57.380 --> 10:00.060]  And I would argue not eating the pencil has made way more content
[10:00.060 --> 10:01.320]  than if I would have just eaten it.
[10:01.780 --> 10:03.880]  Man, I want to see the movie poster for pencil two.
[10:06.540 --> 10:07.400]  Number two pencil?
[10:08.660 --> 10:10.080]  Yeah, but pencil two, it's the sequel.
[10:10.260 --> 10:12.260]  Dude, number two pencil is pretty good.
[10:12.620 --> 10:15.080]  Number two, oh, but it wouldn't be called that.
[10:15.140 --> 10:18.720]  We do like the now you see me thing where we do now you see me two and three,
[10:18.780 --> 10:20.680]  and then we finally do now you don't.
[10:20.700 --> 10:22.040]  It would take us a while to get there.
[10:22.640 --> 10:27.080]  Unfortunately, story of the pencil number two is already a movie.
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.580]  Oh, man.
[10:28.740 --> 10:29.480]  Sorry, guys.
[10:29.900 --> 10:32.380]  There's something so good looking about pencil as an item.
[10:32.840 --> 10:34.900]  What if we call it pencil to the sharpening?
[10:35.600 --> 10:38.380]  Oh, what if we just call pencils?
[10:38.840 --> 10:39.700]  Make it like a thriller.
[10:39.900 --> 10:42.280]  Oh, pencils. That sounds like a Zach Galifianakis comedy.
[10:42.500 --> 10:43.280]  Like aliens.
[10:43.820 --> 10:45.820]  Pencils as an aliens thing is interesting.
[10:46.420 --> 10:48.640]  And the third one would be called per three encel.
[10:48.640 --> 10:50.920]  Oh, awesome.
[10:52.440 --> 10:53.420]  Professor lists.
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.920]  You not believe the pencils that that fucking Android is making.
[10:58.260 --> 10:59.420]  It's crazy.
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.040]  Which one was that?
[11:01.400 --> 11:03.000]  What was the sequel to Prometheus called?
[11:03.100 --> 11:05.340]  Covenant Covenant Alien Covenant.
[11:05.540 --> 11:07.180]  Yeah, doesn't matter.
[11:07.600 --> 11:09.180]  Are there any other alien movies coming out?
[11:09.600 --> 11:10.620]  There's a TV show.
[11:11.120 --> 11:11.620]  Yeah, I know.
[11:11.660 --> 11:16.360]  But aside from that, no, it's the year predator alien rebus.
[11:16.360 --> 11:20.200]  They got like two different predator movies coming out this year of predator.
[11:20.520 --> 11:21.840]  Yeah, interesting.
[11:21.960 --> 11:24.260]  And they're doing like the Terminator two thing with it,
[11:24.280 --> 11:27.920]  I think where it's like a predator hunting other predators for some reason.
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.740]  Oh, like he's on the he's a good guy.
[11:29.860 --> 11:31.720]  I don't know if he's a good guy,
[11:31.780 --> 11:36.940]  but like he's working with an Android to take out a worse predator for some reason.
[11:36.960 --> 11:37.320]  I don't know.
[11:37.360 --> 11:39.120]  A worse, a worse predator.
[11:39.220 --> 11:40.440]  Oh, this predator is so bad.
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.680]  I mean, the predators aren't they're not terrible.
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.180]  Generally speaking, like there's a code of conduct that they operate by.
[11:49.320 --> 11:52.260]  They're just not like aimlessly murdering people, right?
[11:52.280 --> 11:56.300]  He's a predator who has all the same gifts and abilities as the other predators.
[11:56.300 --> 11:58.140]  But he he was came from a broken home.
[11:59.840 --> 12:01.820]  He grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.
[12:02.060 --> 12:03.500]  It's a Dexter situation.
[12:03.780 --> 12:06.180]  It's he he hunts the predators that are no good.
[12:06.720 --> 12:09.780]  Is there a link between predators and humans in the movies?
[12:10.300 --> 12:11.940]  Not established, I don't think.
[12:11.940 --> 12:15.240]  So it's just like a completely human body with a weird face.
[12:15.280 --> 12:15.740]  Is it an alien?
[12:16.900 --> 12:18.040]  Yeah, I guess.
[12:19.540 --> 12:20.940]  You think a predator has a wiener?
[12:21.940 --> 12:25.240]  Because in Covenant, David makes like a xenomorph, essentially.
[12:25.340 --> 12:27.160]  I don't think we know where they came from, though.
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.920]  I don't know if they were man-made.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.040]  I don't think that's been established.
[12:32.460 --> 12:33.840]  Is David Michael Fassbender?
[12:34.540 --> 12:34.940]  Yes.
[12:35.560 --> 12:37.540]  Okay, just making sure I know who you're talking about.
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.700]  Yeah, Michael Fassbender, the star of Assassin's Creed.
[12:42.620 --> 12:44.020]  Everybody's favorite Fassbender movie.
[12:44.260 --> 12:46.040]  I just saw him in a movie the other night.
[12:46.500 --> 12:48.380]  You know, I watched those Equalizer movies and I thought,
[12:48.480 --> 12:50.020]  fuck, maybe I'll watch another movie.
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.120]  And so the other night in bed, I watched Black Bag.
[12:52.260 --> 12:52.640]  Pretty good.
[12:52.780 --> 12:55.160]  Dude, I loved that movie.
[12:55.360 --> 12:59.780]  It is like 90 minutes hard and it's so fun.
[13:00.100 --> 13:01.700]  It is. I love that. I loved it.
[13:01.720 --> 13:03.560]  I recommend that to everyone. What a great movie.
[13:03.880 --> 13:05.360]  Very intense, very gripping.
[13:05.860 --> 13:08.440]  Speaking of hard, I got a new worst Tom Cruise movie.
[13:09.380 --> 13:11.640]  Bumped Legend. Losing it. Terrible.
[13:12.400 --> 13:14.420]  Such a bad movie. Have you seen Losing It, Geoff?
[13:14.960 --> 13:16.720]  When I was like eight, maybe.
[13:17.820 --> 13:18.260]  Horrible.
[13:18.440 --> 13:19.820]  Holy shit. When did that movie come out?
[13:20.140 --> 13:21.780]  Like 83, maybe?
[13:22.160 --> 13:23.180]  I don't... yeah, I was eight.
[13:24.340 --> 13:25.920]  19... 1982. Losing It.
[13:26.360 --> 13:28.380]  Yeah, I didn't even realize he was in it.
[13:28.700 --> 13:30.580]  That was a titty movie when I was growing up.
[13:30.740 --> 13:36.240]  It sure is. It's about a group of high school kids going to Tijuana to lose their virginity
[13:36.240 --> 13:37.440]  by going to a whorehouse.
[13:37.920 --> 13:38.520]  Oh, wow.
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.840]  And they bring one of the character's little brothers to buy fireworks because he, like,
[13:42.960 --> 13:43.780]  sells them at the school.
[13:44.220 --> 13:46.540]  It has Rorschach in it.
[13:47.180 --> 13:47.960]  Jackie Earl Haley.
[13:48.560 --> 13:49.560]  Wow. Really?
[13:49.800 --> 13:52.040]  He's like maybe the comedic lead in it.
[13:52.100 --> 13:53.140]  It's just... oh, it's bad.
[13:53.460 --> 13:54.900]  Shelley Long is in it too, right?
[13:55.260 --> 13:56.640]  She is. Yeah, she is.
[13:58.440 --> 14:00.440]  She's in a relationship with Tom Cruise in the movie.
[14:00.520 --> 14:01.880]  It's very bad. Oh, my God.
[14:01.960 --> 14:02.440]  It's not good.
[14:02.860 --> 14:05.800]  I want to see a version of Watchmen where Rorschach is the comic relief.
[14:06.600 --> 14:06.820]  Yeah.
[14:06.820 --> 14:10.940]  It is really funny in the movie where they separate off the Tom Cruise and Shelley Long
[14:10.940 --> 14:13.940]  characters, and it feels like, oh, yeah, these are the best actors in this.
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.160]  Let's just let's have them have their chunk of the movie.
[14:17.420 --> 14:21.140]  It is by far all of their solo scenes are the best parts of the film.
[14:21.760 --> 14:22.500]  It's terrible.
[14:23.160 --> 14:23.820]  There's one.
[14:24.140 --> 14:25.660]  There's only one good gag in it.
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.900]  I really enjoy when watching a horrible movie, finding like the one thing that is like, oh,
[14:29.900 --> 14:30.420]  that was good.
[14:31.040 --> 14:34.940]  They have to flee Tijuana and there's a cop chasing them at the end.
[14:34.940 --> 14:39.720]  And the kid that buys all the fireworks lights them and throws the bag in the car.
[14:39.960 --> 14:43.740]  And so the sheriff is delayed and like chasing them because he's got to wait for the fireworks
[14:43.740 --> 14:44.240]  to go off.
[14:44.420 --> 14:46.320]  But then he decides to just go anyway.
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.800]  And so it's a car chase.
[14:47.860 --> 14:51.920]  And every once in a while, his car just flashes because there's still things going off.
[14:52.020 --> 14:55.260]  And it's the one funny gag in the whole movie.
[14:55.480 --> 15:00.360]  And they don't do it long enough, but they do like he drives and everything seems fine.
[15:00.460 --> 15:02.340]  Then he turns the corner and starts flashing again.
[15:02.360 --> 15:02.920]  And it's great.
[15:03.840 --> 15:04.580]  That's funny.
[15:04.580 --> 15:05.680]  It is very funny.
[15:05.860 --> 15:09.060]  But outside of that, terrible, such a bad movie.
[15:09.600 --> 15:12.220]  Yeah, I don't think I've seen that movie since puberty.
[15:12.560 --> 15:12.920]  Probably.
[15:13.380 --> 15:17.740]  I think you saw it at the perfect time to see it at the perfect year to see it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.220]  Not worth revisiting.
[15:19.680 --> 15:20.540]  But it is on YouTube.
[15:21.180 --> 15:23.180]  So it's I mean, you saw it again after you ate?
[15:23.640 --> 15:25.920]  No, I don't think I've seen it since I turned since I hit puberty.
[15:26.640 --> 15:26.980]  Eight.
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.640]  I hit puberty at 13.
[15:29.020 --> 15:30.920]  I'm saying I don't I don't think I've seen it.
[15:31.320 --> 15:32.320]  OK, right.
[15:32.460 --> 15:34.200]  So but you've seen it after that, right?
[15:35.640 --> 15:38.120]  Gavin has his notebook out like he's in L.A. Noire.
[15:38.560 --> 15:39.660]  He's like, wait a second.
[15:40.340 --> 15:41.240]  X to doubt.
[15:41.300 --> 15:42.440]  Doubt. I'm doubting you.
[15:43.060 --> 15:45.860]  Now, for some reason, I just couldn't comprehend you watching it after it came out.
[15:48.700 --> 15:50.860]  I did. I didn't see it at the theater.
[15:51.260 --> 15:54.660]  I think I probably saw it on a VHS tape at a friend's house.
[15:54.660 --> 15:55.460]  OK, OK.
[15:55.560 --> 15:58.000]  I was somewhere around seven, eight or nine.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.320]  And I didn't see it again.
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.280]  And then you watch it again when you were like 13.
[16:01.520 --> 16:01.940]  I didn't know.
[16:01.940 --> 16:03.020]  And then you watch it again recently.
[16:03.020 --> 16:05.360]  At what time did you watch on YouTube like me, Geoff?
[16:05.720 --> 16:06.360]  That movie.
[16:06.640 --> 16:10.840]  The reason I brought up puberty is just like a milestone in a kid's life that you can mark
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.260]  things by.
[16:11.640 --> 16:17.020]  But also, I think I probably would have appreciated the movie more post-puberty
[16:17.020 --> 16:19.240]  because I would have been a horny little Geoff, you know?
[16:19.620 --> 16:21.980]  But I saw it when I was a kid when boobs meant nothing to me.
[16:22.040 --> 16:22.640]  So, yeah.
[16:22.700 --> 16:25.980]  Why don't you do your first pubic viewing of Loser?
[16:28.160 --> 16:28.560]  What?
[16:28.860 --> 16:29.480]  Dude, what?
[16:29.900 --> 16:33.640]  Dude, actually for so alright a while back, I was going to watch the...
[16:33.640 --> 16:36.360]  I tried to watch the ski movie, Hot Dog.
[16:36.980 --> 16:37.800]  You know that one?
[16:38.380 --> 16:38.660]  Hell yeah.
[16:38.660 --> 16:39.620]  I think you've mentioned it before.
[16:40.320 --> 16:46.200]  I made it about 14 minutes in and I had to turn it off because I was offended by all
[16:46.200 --> 16:48.080]  of the comical sexual assault.
[16:48.460 --> 16:49.700]  And I was just like, this is...
[16:49.700 --> 16:50.740]  Everybody's going to jail.
[16:50.960 --> 16:51.880]  I cannot watch this.
[16:51.940 --> 16:53.240]  I'm going to go to hell for watching this.
[16:53.380 --> 16:55.360]  And this was like a PG movie when I was a kid.
[16:55.400 --> 16:56.240]  It's fucking crazy.
[16:56.660 --> 16:58.100]  Not literally PG movie, but you know what I mean?
[16:58.100 --> 16:59.960]  It was like a movie that every kid saw when I was a kid growing up.
[17:00.020 --> 17:03.320]  It's just like, man, it's so stark how much the world has changed in my lifetime.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.440]  It's like, I don't think I should watch.
[17:05.780 --> 17:07.420]  I don't think I should watch Losing It either.
[17:08.320 --> 17:09.520]  No, no, you shouldn't.
[17:10.280 --> 17:13.940]  There's a large subplot about the main supposed to be likable character
[17:13.940 --> 17:17.040]  wanting to buy roofies in Mexico and being very excited about it.
[17:17.300 --> 17:17.920]  It's terrible.
[17:17.920 --> 17:18.680]  Oh, I remember that.
[17:18.780 --> 17:19.080]  Yeah.
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.080]  Or was it Busted Loose where they were trying to buy Spanish Fly?
[17:22.460 --> 17:23.680]  No, no, no, it was Losing It.
[17:23.820 --> 17:24.420]  It's Spanish Fly.
[17:24.600 --> 17:24.980]  It's Losing It?
[17:25.100 --> 17:26.220]  Okay, that's what they call it.
[17:26.320 --> 17:26.460]  Yeah.
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.820]  It's not great.
[17:28.920 --> 17:30.300]  It sounds bad.
[17:30.380 --> 17:34.400]  If we can get away from this whole topic, can I shift gears a little bit?
[17:34.460 --> 17:34.920]  Yeah, of course.
[17:35.080 --> 17:40.760]  And show that a regulation listener is introducing...
[17:40.760 --> 17:41.920]  Oh, Lil' Geoffy!
[17:42.320 --> 17:42.920]  Lil' Geoffy!
[17:43.120 --> 17:43.280]  Lil' Geoffy!
[17:43.280 --> 17:44.400]  This is Bailey is Great.
[17:44.680 --> 17:47.660]  On the subreddit, this is Lil' Geoffy.
[17:48.900 --> 17:50.620]  Oh, that's so cute.
[17:51.060 --> 17:52.200]  Beautiful little kitten.
[17:52.600 --> 17:53.940]  Oh, if you're listening, there's a cat.
[17:54.080 --> 17:55.140]  It's a picture of a cat.
[17:55.140 --> 17:57.260]  Oh, this is a cute little small cat.
[17:57.560 --> 17:58.640]  Oh, they said they wanted to honor me.
[17:58.700 --> 18:00.440]  I feel exceptionally honored.
[18:00.560 --> 18:03.100]  Thank you so much, Bailey is Great.
[18:03.280 --> 18:04.000]  You are great.
[18:04.520 --> 18:06.580]  And what a cute little cat Lil' Geoffy is.
[18:06.620 --> 18:08.180]  Cute little cat, Lil' Geoffy the cat.
[18:08.340 --> 18:08.720]  There you go.

[18:12.380 --> 18:14.760]  Booking a doctor appointment can just feel so daunting.

[19:52.260 --> 19:54.060]  Yeah, yeah, just had to keep an eye on it.
[19:54.120 --> 19:54.580]  Yeah, there you go.
[19:54.860 --> 19:57.200]  Can I pivot to another palate cleanse real fast?
[19:57.320 --> 19:57.480]  Please.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.760]  I went to Home Depot on Saturday to buy some stuff for the house.
[20:01.380 --> 20:03.760]  And my house, not the fucking office house.
[20:04.740 --> 20:09.100]  And while I was there, I realized I had to take a bad piss.
[20:09.700 --> 20:10.580]  Like, I gotta go.
[20:11.680 --> 20:17.580]  Being an old dude is kind of like being six again,
[20:17.580 --> 20:21.820]  where you go from like zero to I'm going to piss my pants in like eight seconds.
[20:21.960 --> 20:23.040]  You're like, I think I have to pee.
[20:23.140 --> 20:24.900]  And then you go, I think I'm going to pee right now.
[20:25.020 --> 20:26.040]  You're like, how did that happen?
[20:26.340 --> 20:27.600]  But it's also inconsistent.
[20:27.880 --> 20:28.980]  Like, sometimes that doesn't happen.
[20:29.080 --> 20:30.540]  And then just like one day, it's like, no, no.
[20:30.540 --> 20:31.620]  Today's the day you're going to piss your pants.
[20:32.960 --> 20:34.140]  And so I ran.
[20:34.240 --> 20:35.140]  I was like talking to Emily.
[20:35.240 --> 20:36.220]  She was looking at plants or something.
[20:36.300 --> 20:38.820]  I was like, I'm gonna go run, find the bathroom, take a piss real fast.
[20:38.940 --> 20:41.680]  All of course, it was all the way on the other side of Home Depot.
[20:41.980 --> 20:45.020]  So I was doing like the piss walk and trying not to hold my dick as I walked.
[20:45.140 --> 20:46.000]  I was really trying to keep it in.
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.860]  And then I've never experienced this before,
[20:48.880 --> 20:53.860]  but it's on the far wall where like the lumber and like sheetrock and stuff is.
[20:55.120 --> 20:59.000]  And I was about an aisle out from the bathroom.
[20:59.080 --> 21:00.840]  I can see the break in the wall.
[21:01.020 --> 21:02.180]  It's just like it's not a door or anything.
[21:02.260 --> 21:03.220]  It's just like a hallway.
[21:03.340 --> 21:04.120]  You go in and take a left.
[21:05.540 --> 21:09.540]  And more than an aisle out, I started to smell human waste.
[21:09.540 --> 21:13.340]  And I thought, oh, am I smelling that?
[21:13.380 --> 21:15.980]  I'm like, wow, they need to clean the bathroom or something.
[21:15.980 --> 21:18.180]  They must be having plumbing problems, right?
[21:18.420 --> 21:23.260]  And it became so intense that I felt as almost as if I was pushing
[21:23.260 --> 21:26.620]  against the poop smelling air as I got closer and closer.
[21:26.820 --> 21:27.600]  It was so dense.
[21:28.080 --> 21:31.340]  And I was like, I got to a point where I thought if I didn't have to pee this terribly,
[21:31.360 --> 21:32.580]  I would not walk into this bathroom.
[21:32.900 --> 21:34.340]  Like, I don't know what's wrong with this.
[21:34.400 --> 21:37.360]  I expect to walk in and there to be a sign that says like,
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.340]  do not use and just like puddles of shit everywhere,
[21:40.480 --> 21:42.940]  bubbling up out of spigots in the ground or something, you know?
[21:43.580 --> 21:45.080]  But I'm going to pee my pants otherwise.
[21:45.080 --> 21:49.880]  So I go in and as I'm going in, I hear somebody take one of my shits.
[21:50.120 --> 21:51.580]  You know what my shits sound like, right?
[21:51.800 --> 21:54.180]  They're like an explosion and it's painful.
[21:54.540 --> 21:56.740]  And it's like, and it sounds like somebody's painting a wall.
[21:57.560 --> 21:59.100]  And I go, whoa.
[21:59.260 --> 22:03.240]  And I look and the first stall over there is just me and then a stall that's shut.
[22:03.780 --> 22:05.940]  And as soon as the guy takes his dump, he goes,
[22:07.360 --> 22:11.580]  and I thought, that's the grossest thing I've heard somebody do after a loud shit.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.800]  And so I run over and I'm trying to pee real fast
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.740]  and then trying to wash my hands to get out of there.
[22:15.900 --> 22:18.060]  And in the like, however long that took, not terribly long,
[22:18.580 --> 22:23.060]  that guy, he shit another four times to five total while I was in there.
[22:23.160 --> 22:26.360]  And every time after he exploded, he would go,
[22:28.900 --> 22:31.520]  and then as I was washing my hands, he flushed the toilet.
[22:31.600 --> 22:33.780]  And I thought, I cannot see the human being that made this.
[22:33.840 --> 22:35.020]  So I ran out of the bathroom.
[22:35.160 --> 22:38.480]  I did not want to make eye contact with that whatever human that is.
[22:38.740 --> 22:42.020]  No, I just didn't want to know because there was something so unsettling
[22:42.020 --> 22:47.120]  about how satisfied he was verbally each time he exploded.
[22:47.720 --> 22:50.580]  Like, it's almost as if he was like, good one, nailed it.
[22:50.880 --> 22:52.440]  Yeah, miss your chance to meet the equalizer.
[22:52.920 --> 22:53.200]  Real shit.
[22:53.460 --> 22:54.080]  Exactly right.
[22:54.180 --> 22:58.240]  And when I do it, I go, oh, dear God, I'm so sorry I'm alive, you know?
[22:58.260 --> 23:00.280]  And I'm like, I hope no other human being on earth heard this,
[23:00.320 --> 23:01.540]  unless I'm recording it for y'all, of course.
[23:02.620 --> 23:06.120]  And there was just something about the confidence and pleasure with which he was
[23:06.820 --> 23:09.840]  that just made me think he's probably a stone cold killer.
[23:09.980 --> 23:11.300]  And so I didn't want to be around him.
[23:12.440 --> 23:14.340]  Maybe it's something you get in later life.
[23:14.940 --> 23:15.460]  I don't know.
[23:15.700 --> 23:17.800]  He definitely sounded older than I did.
[23:18.120 --> 23:19.760]  Than I than I am, you know?
[23:19.800 --> 23:21.900]  Yeah, I envisioned him older for some reason.
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.540]  I assume he's like an older dude with gray hair, you know?
[23:27.020 --> 23:30.480]  Because it wouldn't be someone who's like 21 and then do it.
[23:31.520 --> 23:34.060]  And that is that's my one thing for this podcast.
[23:34.120 --> 23:35.100]  That's all I had this week.
[23:35.200 --> 23:36.820]  So, oh, I'm done.
[23:37.540 --> 23:38.100]  Oh, man.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.880]  That was a nice palate cleanse away from the cats.
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.840]  Yeah, thanks.
[23:42.500 --> 23:44.620]  Would you ever Dave England style it if you had to?
[23:44.980 --> 23:45.840]  Like in a public bathroom?
[23:46.320 --> 23:47.600]  No, no, no.
[23:47.600 --> 23:51.420]  The you know, when he took a shit or whatever in the toilet, that's just because Home Depot
[23:51.420 --> 23:52.300]  filled with toilets.
[23:52.660 --> 23:54.000]  Oh, you mean the display toilet?
[23:54.140 --> 23:54.940]  Yeah, the display.
[23:55.240 --> 23:56.140]  You really had to pee.
[23:57.120 --> 23:59.980]  If I really had to pee, would I piss in a display toilet?
[24:00.220 --> 24:01.460]  Yeah, I would use the display toilet.
[24:01.600 --> 24:04.280]  It's surely better just to piss on the floor at that point.
[24:04.320 --> 24:04.900]  You think so?
[24:05.040 --> 24:06.600]  You got to find a trash can.
[24:06.640 --> 24:07.380]  You got to piss in it.
[24:07.380 --> 24:09.000]  You got to piss in a trash can, right?
[24:09.060 --> 24:10.500]  I didn't even consider that.
[24:10.880 --> 24:15.140]  If it was that bad, I would have run outside and just pissed against the wall.
[24:15.900 --> 24:16.180]  Probably.
[24:16.740 --> 24:16.780]  That's interesting.
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.360]  Like into like the gardens, like in the garden section?
[24:19.640 --> 24:21.360]  Yeah, like in the back of the garden section.
[24:22.020 --> 24:22.840]  Piss on the porch.
[24:22.860 --> 24:23.700]  You're already there with Emily.
[24:23.820 --> 24:24.260]  It's perfect.
[24:24.380 --> 24:25.500]  You don't need to go anywhere.
[24:26.440 --> 24:27.580]  All these bags of shit.
[24:27.700 --> 24:28.700]  I just screamed like, don't look at me.
[24:28.780 --> 24:29.480]  I'm so sorry.
[24:29.700 --> 24:31.780]  All this sod smells like piss.
[24:32.560 --> 24:34.080]  We're going to buy it anyway.
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.260]  If you pissed in the display toilet, wouldn't it just leak out the back of the toilet?
[24:39.200 --> 24:40.860]  I guess it would, wouldn't it?
[24:40.880 --> 24:42.580]  Where did you think it went?
[24:42.780 --> 24:44.800]  I just kind of imagined it holding it.
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.260]  You would basically just be covering an unpurchased toilet in piss,
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.640]  now requiring you to buy the toilet, probably.
[24:54.160 --> 24:54.960]  Holding it?
[24:55.000 --> 24:55.940]  And it doesn't hold it.
[24:56.100 --> 24:58.120]  Yeah, you know, like how the water just holds.
[24:58.680 --> 25:00.260]  Isn't it held by the water in the pipe?
[25:00.500 --> 25:02.380]  It is. Yeah, exactly.
[25:02.640 --> 25:04.920]  But I'm just saying in my imagination, that's what would happen.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.260]  I would be... I haven't thought about it.
[25:07.340 --> 25:07.760]  Just fill up the toilet with piss.
[25:07.760 --> 25:11.260]  Like the pee trap you guys have installed on all these display toilets,
[25:11.400 --> 25:12.420]  it's going to help here or what?
[25:12.800 --> 25:13.620]  How often do you guys...
[25:13.620 --> 25:16.200]  Yeah, how often do you guys empty the piss traps on these toilets?
[25:17.740 --> 25:18.360]  Uncork it.
[25:21.420 --> 25:22.440]  I just, yeah, I'd be shocked.
[25:23.140 --> 25:24.140]  I'd never thought about it.
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.260]  But if I had to panic pee in a display toilet, I would have assumed that it would help.
[25:28.820 --> 25:31.760]  Let's go around and say where we would panic pee in...
[25:32.960 --> 25:34.500]  Let's say a Home Depot.
[25:34.700 --> 25:35.200]  That's fine.
[25:36.000 --> 25:36.940]  Let's start with Nick.
[25:36.940 --> 25:38.600]  Nick, where would you panic pee in the Home Depot?
[25:41.580 --> 25:42.180]  I've got mine.
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.160]  If the bathroom is no option...
[25:44.160 --> 25:44.320]  Yeah.
[25:44.380 --> 25:45.060]  I'm going outside.
[25:45.700 --> 25:46.000]  Okay.
[25:46.300 --> 25:47.160]  And I'm going...
[25:47.160 --> 25:48.060]  The hot dog guy is there.
[25:50.520 --> 25:53.200]  I'm going out to the garden section.
[25:53.240 --> 25:53.400]  Yeah.
[25:53.440 --> 25:53.640]  Okay.
[25:53.860 --> 25:56.140]  I'm going behind the mulch.
[25:56.640 --> 25:56.940]  Okay.
[25:57.180 --> 25:57.440]  Okay.
[25:57.820 --> 25:58.060]  Okay.
[25:58.400 --> 25:59.440]  Behind the mulch.
[25:59.540 --> 26:00.440]  So he took my answer.
[26:00.820 --> 26:01.240]  Yeah, he did.
[26:01.280 --> 26:01.740]  He stole it.
[26:01.780 --> 26:03.360]  He heard what you said and he said, I'll just...
[26:03.360 --> 26:03.720]  Gotta satisfy.
[26:04.100 --> 26:04.860]  Nick, it's okay.
[26:04.920 --> 26:05.640]  It's not a draft.
[26:05.640 --> 26:09.080]  Yeah, which really puts you at a disadvantage, Geoff.
[26:09.220 --> 26:10.600]  So where would you pee?
[26:11.640 --> 26:13.380]  And it can't be the same place.
[26:13.980 --> 26:14.640]  Oh, man.
[26:15.440 --> 26:16.540]  I'm gonna piss.
[26:16.660 --> 26:22.420]  I'm gonna go into the garden section and I'm gonna piss on the perennials.
[26:23.840 --> 26:24.320]  Okay.
[26:25.940 --> 26:28.040]  Gavin, where would you piss?
[26:28.040 --> 26:31.840]  I'd probably just start like peeking around little staff-only areas, little doors,
[26:31.920 --> 26:34.200]  and I'd just piss in the mop bucket or something.
[26:34.840 --> 26:35.240]  Oh.
[26:36.020 --> 26:39.380]  I'd take the mop out, have a piss in that, then I'd rinse it out,
[26:39.940 --> 26:42.260]  get it nice and clean, and then put it back.
[26:42.420 --> 26:45.560]  You're at the Home Depot cleaning out the employee mop bucket.
[26:46.520 --> 26:47.900]  Don't worry about this.
[26:50.260 --> 26:51.660]  Oh, I got a great one.
[26:52.060 --> 26:52.300]  Oh, yeah.
[26:52.320 --> 26:52.960]  Can I change my answer?
[26:53.300 --> 26:53.580]  Sure.
[26:53.660 --> 26:54.060]  Of course.
[26:54.260 --> 26:57.640]  I would piss in one of the orange five-gallon buckets that you got.
[26:57.820 --> 26:57.900]  Yeah.
[26:58.020 --> 26:58.420]  Yes.
[26:58.840 --> 26:59.240]  Yeah.
[26:59.760 --> 27:00.160]  Yeah.
[27:00.620 --> 27:02.760]  That's exactly what I was gonna say,
[27:02.760 --> 27:09.620]  but I'll change my answer to the overhead, the ceiling fan and light section and just sort of...
[27:10.360 --> 27:11.560]  Yeah, there's never anybody in there.
[27:11.740 --> 27:13.000]  Nuh-uh. No, it's empty.
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.840]  There's no one looking at ceiling fans and overhead lights in the Home Depot.
[27:17.380 --> 27:22.120]  I know that it's like the most lit area, but no one's gonna come over and help you.
[27:22.460 --> 27:25.540]  No one's over there anyway, so I feel like you can get away with it over there.
[27:25.860 --> 27:31.040]  I would consider near the paint mixer to cover the noise.
[27:32.320 --> 27:32.720]  That's...
[27:32.720 --> 27:35.540]  Nobody can hear you pee.
[27:35.860 --> 27:37.320]  That's a manned paint mixer.
[27:37.600 --> 27:40.500]  Yeah, the problem with the paint mixer is that an employee works it,
[27:40.600 --> 27:44.060]  and it's in the middle front of every Home Depot I've ever been to.
[27:44.220 --> 27:45.860]  Do you think you could pull off?
[27:45.920 --> 27:48.460]  Because it's like a... there's like a... they're surrounded, right?
[27:48.660 --> 27:52.020]  They're boxed in by the... like a big... like horseshoe shaped...
[27:52.020 --> 27:52.980]  Yeah, like a desk.
[27:53.560 --> 27:56.020]  Yeah, desk. And it's a little higher than a normal one.
[27:56.300 --> 28:00.480]  Do you think while they're... like you could go give somebody a couple of cans of paint
[28:00.480 --> 28:05.820]  to shake up for you and then stand there and just be having a conversation with them
[28:05.820 --> 28:09.860]  and pissing below the level of the table and they would never know?
[28:11.300 --> 28:15.280]  This is where it turns into an 80s comedy and you piss into an empty can
[28:15.280 --> 28:17.800]  and then that gets mixed in with the ones that need mixing.
[28:18.420 --> 28:24.040]  Yeah! And then it goes to your principal's house and he paints his walls with your piss paint.
[28:24.380 --> 28:24.420]  Yeah!
[28:24.460 --> 28:26.860]  Somebody get Tom Cruise on the phone.
[28:27.760 --> 28:29.780]  Maybe that's what happened in our little gaming room.
[28:30.760 --> 28:31.160]  Oh.
[28:31.320 --> 28:32.660]  Oh, you think so?
[28:32.840 --> 28:34.100]  That's why it smells like piss?
[28:34.560 --> 28:37.580]  Yeah. We should film losing it too. Found it.
[28:40.580 --> 28:45.380]  Uh, yeah, Gavin. Gavin brought over a cat piss smell to our new house.
[28:45.840 --> 28:46.040]  Yeah.
[28:46.140 --> 28:47.300]  I mean, it was there before I got there.
[28:47.920 --> 28:48.580]  If you say so.
[28:48.620 --> 28:51.420]  Yeah, I don't know about that. I mean, I haven't smelt it, but...
[28:51.420 --> 28:55.460]  It's weird how it has its strong days and its not strong days.
[28:56.060 --> 28:58.200]  Are the strong days the day that Gavin's there
[28:58.200 --> 29:00.360]  and the not strong days the days when Gavin's not there?
[29:00.480 --> 29:02.920]  You know, I hadn't connected those dots.
[29:03.360 --> 29:05.120]  I think it's when you blast the AC.
[29:05.640 --> 29:06.180]  It goes away?
[29:06.600 --> 29:07.380]  I think it comes.
[29:08.120 --> 29:08.240]  Oh.
[29:08.580 --> 29:11.360]  I feel like it's when it's hot and still in there.
[29:11.640 --> 29:14.460]  That's when it really starts to permeate.
[29:15.200 --> 29:17.400]  Also, can we stop pissing in that room, please?
[29:17.840 --> 29:19.540]  There's a bathroom right next door.
[29:19.580 --> 29:21.020]  I gotta say, no deal.
[29:21.720 --> 29:23.580]  It's not my fault they put the paint mixer in there.
[29:28.800 --> 29:30.340]  Do you think you could piss
[29:30.340 --> 29:33.700]  while having a conversation with someone without them knowing you're pissing?
[29:33.820 --> 29:34.220]  Oh, no.
[29:34.760 --> 29:36.300]  No, the second part, probably not.
[29:36.840 --> 29:39.140]  I mean, half the time I'm texting you, I'm shitting.
[29:39.700 --> 29:40.880]  Yeah, but I'm not looking at your face.
[29:41.300 --> 29:41.740]  That's true.
[29:42.000 --> 29:43.040]  And you're not trying to hide it.
[29:43.320 --> 29:45.280]  I think I could. I think I could. Yeah.
[29:46.020 --> 29:47.620]  It might be an interesting challenge.
[29:47.900 --> 29:49.260]  Just in the middle of our conversation,
[29:49.300 --> 29:51.220]  suddenly you hear the toilet flush and you're like, wait a minute.
[29:51.780 --> 29:53.680]  I never broke eye contact with you.
[29:53.860 --> 29:56.140]  Well, I just think maybe we should stand at a hidden table
[29:56.140 --> 29:57.840]  and have five conversations with someone.
[29:58.040 --> 29:59.780]  But one of the times they were pissing.
[29:59.960 --> 30:02.100]  Oh, eye contact piss roulette.
[30:02.440 --> 30:03.840]  Yeah, I like that.
[30:04.040 --> 30:05.540]  And see if they could hold it together enough
[30:06.700 --> 30:09.760]  to keep it on the down-low while they're pissing.
[30:09.820 --> 30:12.560]  How about you can't leave the table until you piss.
[30:12.720 --> 30:14.860]  And if you get caught pissing, you lose.
[30:15.260 --> 30:18.080]  But everyone only has one chance to say you're pissing.
[30:18.280 --> 30:19.560]  There's like a piss buzzer.
[30:19.560 --> 30:20.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:20.900 --> 30:22.600]  It's like, yeah, it's like a one time uno.
[30:23.640 --> 30:25.540]  This, this is fetish content.
[30:25.880 --> 30:27.000]  Is that? Yeah, it is.
[30:27.500 --> 30:28.180]  Yeah. Is this?
[30:28.480 --> 30:30.800]  Yeah, this is fetish content is what it feels like.
[30:30.880 --> 30:32.280]  OK, let's not make it fetish content.
[30:32.540 --> 30:34.960]  Everyone's playing Mile High Club at the same time.
[30:35.420 --> 30:36.140]  Yeah, I just.
[30:39.160 --> 30:40.480]  Well, hold on.
[30:40.560 --> 30:42.020]  Is there money in fetish content?
[30:42.600 --> 30:44.560]  I think there's a lot of money in it, probably.
[30:44.680 --> 30:45.780]  Yeah, I'd assume.
[30:46.300 --> 30:48.400]  Have I talked about my Gumpler idea?
[30:49.020 --> 30:49.500]  Gumpler?
[30:50.240 --> 30:50.720]  No.
[30:51.120 --> 30:51.920]  What's a Gumpler?
[30:53.160 --> 30:53.980]  Oh, interesting.
[30:54.160 --> 30:55.340]  Yeah, what do you think the Gumpler is?
[30:56.580 --> 30:57.060]  Gumpler.
[30:57.400 --> 30:59.880]  So it's probably Gurpler adjacent.
[31:01.180 --> 31:03.800]  It's got to be Gurpler and Forrest Gump related, doesn't it?
[31:04.480 --> 31:06.400]  Just Tom Hanks' Gurpler?
[31:06.660 --> 31:07.240]  The Gumpler?
[31:07.940 --> 31:09.480]  Maybe it's like a shrimp thing.
[31:09.620 --> 31:10.880]  Maybe it like coat shrimp.
[31:11.300 --> 31:12.260]  Oh, oh, oh.
[31:12.400 --> 31:13.400]  Like it's a, uh.
[31:13.720 --> 31:14.460]  De-sheller maybe?
[31:14.480 --> 31:14.800]  What is it?
[31:14.820 --> 31:15.060]  Shrimp?
[31:15.120 --> 31:15.540]  No, no.
[31:15.620 --> 31:16.820]  It's like a shrimp cocktail.
[31:16.820 --> 31:19.300]  It's just like the ultimate shrimp cocktail holder.
[31:20.300 --> 31:21.180]  Why would that be called a Gumpler?
[31:21.660 --> 31:23.260]  Because of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company.
[31:24.060 --> 31:25.660]  Oh, still in the Forrest Gump thing.
[31:26.420 --> 31:26.720]  Yeah.
[31:27.260 --> 31:27.620]  Yeah.
[31:28.440 --> 31:28.800]  Yes.
[31:30.040 --> 31:30.400]  Gump.
[31:30.580 --> 31:32.700]  Are there any other Gumps than Forrest Gump?
[31:33.300 --> 31:34.380]  I can't think of any.
[31:34.780 --> 31:36.840]  Is it a piece of gum the size of a Gurpler?
[31:37.380 --> 31:37.740]  Ooh.
[31:37.800 --> 31:37.880]  No.
[31:38.480 --> 31:39.160]  Do you want me to tell you?
[31:39.580 --> 31:39.760]  No.
[31:39.760 --> 31:40.340]  Well, obviously.
[31:40.520 --> 31:40.780]  No, no.
[31:40.780 --> 31:41.420]  No, not yet.
[31:41.480 --> 31:42.000]  No, not yet.
[31:42.100 --> 31:42.660]  Okay, keep going.
[31:42.880 --> 31:44.440]  We gotta have, Nick hasn't had a guess yet.
[31:46.080 --> 31:46.440]  Gumpler.
[31:47.380 --> 31:48.380]  Gump shit.
[31:48.560 --> 31:48.800]  No.
[31:49.340 --> 31:54.140]  The problem is the ler really doesn't mean anything for the Gurpler, so it's hard to...
[31:54.140 --> 31:55.480]  The plur really doesn't.
[31:55.580 --> 31:55.880]  Yeah.
[31:57.460 --> 32:00.560]  Yeah, the P-L-E-R is the confusing bit.
[32:01.580 --> 32:01.980]  Yeah.
[32:03.440 --> 32:03.960]  Gum.
[32:04.620 --> 32:05.440]  I've got no idea.
[32:06.620 --> 32:07.700]  Is it a mouth guard?
[32:08.180 --> 32:11.120]  Oh, oh, that's really good.
[32:11.180 --> 32:16.460]  It's a mouth guard so you don't grind your teeth when you're sleeping or participating
[32:16.460 --> 32:17.440]  in something else.
[32:17.700 --> 32:18.280]  I'll give you a hint.
[32:18.320 --> 32:19.800]  It's a type of Gurpler.
[32:20.240 --> 32:24.620]  Okay, is it one that it's hidden out of view from everyone when you go on Australian TV?
[32:25.020 --> 32:26.340]  Wasn't in that view and there are three of them.
[32:26.860 --> 32:27.260]  So...
[32:29.900 --> 32:32.940]  I mean, I couldn't really see them, but that's neither here nor there, I suppose.
[32:33.100 --> 32:35.380]  I don't think there were enough pixels in that video to show them off.
[32:36.600 --> 32:38.740]  Is it like a shot glass?
[32:38.840 --> 32:42.540]  Like it's bigger than a baby Gurp, but smaller than a Gurpler?
[32:43.120 --> 32:43.520]  No.
[32:43.520 --> 32:46.560]  I feel like a Gumpler has to be bigger than a Gurpler, right?
[32:46.620 --> 32:49.480]  Because we've talked about baby Gurp, little Gurp, Gurple Jr.
[32:49.920 --> 32:53.220]  And then the big one, which was going to be Gurple X, right?
[32:53.420 --> 32:57.060]  The one that was the Jack had to wear on his back.
[32:57.220 --> 32:57.640]  Gurple Pro Max.
[32:58.100 --> 32:58.780]  Gurple Pro Max.
[32:59.100 --> 33:00.940]  What is the Gumpler, Gavin?
[33:01.500 --> 33:04.320]  It is, in my head, a gummy Gurpler.
[33:04.500 --> 33:06.680]  You know, those five pound gummy bears, right?
[33:06.740 --> 33:10.520]  It would be that melted down and reformed into a cup.
[33:12.500 --> 33:12.940]  Gumpler.
[33:12.940 --> 33:14.500]  And I think we should make one.
[33:14.520 --> 33:18.760]  I think we should take green gummy bears and purple gummy bears
[33:20.900 --> 33:22.580]  and reset them as a Gurpler.
[33:23.100 --> 33:25.300]  I think this is a fucking awesome idea.
[33:25.560 --> 33:25.800]  And I...
[33:26.200 --> 33:27.860]  So we have to make one then, yeah?
[33:28.260 --> 33:28.780]  I think so.
[33:28.920 --> 33:32.300]  And I also want to see if it will hold liquid like a real Gurpler.
[33:32.440 --> 33:33.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:33.560 --> 33:34.300]  Because I assume it would.
[33:34.480 --> 33:37.380]  We can probably double boil some gummies.
[33:37.700 --> 33:38.540]  I assume that would melt.
[33:38.540 --> 33:42.500]  Yeah, I'm gonna, I gotta look at like green gummy bears and just see if I can buy them,
[33:42.640 --> 33:43.260]  like buy...
[33:43.260 --> 33:44.460]  Some sort of a cup form?
[33:45.200 --> 33:46.300]  Yeah, well, couldn't you just...
[33:46.300 --> 33:46.600]  Cup mold?
[33:48.100 --> 33:51.060]  Couldn't you just pour it inside the Gurpler and have it like,
[33:51.080 --> 33:52.440]  you just have to like swish it around a lot?
[33:52.500 --> 33:53.400]  Like, I don't know what you could do.
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.060]  Yeah, but how would it set?
[33:54.640 --> 33:56.920]  It would just, you'd just make a little puck at the bottom of a Gurpler.
[33:57.260 --> 33:59.400]  No, you gotta like, you gotta like move the cup around a lot.
[33:59.480 --> 34:01.100]  So it's like hanging to like the outside.
[34:03.540 --> 34:08.520]  And then you pour, you pour green all on the inside and purple all on the outside.
[34:08.540 --> 34:10.400]  And then you cut the bottom.
[34:10.500 --> 34:12.580]  How do you pour on the outside of a cup?
[34:12.960 --> 34:19.060]  You theoretically could pour it, like have the Gurpler be upside down,
[34:19.180 --> 34:24.760]  pour it on top of the upside down Gurpler, and then you would have a shell of the Gurpler.
[34:24.840 --> 34:25.780]  Right, right.
[34:25.860 --> 34:27.320]  But it's liquid when you pour it.
[34:27.840 --> 34:29.660]  Yeah, but it will harden because it's sugar.
[34:30.800 --> 34:32.640]  How did Geoff do this after puberty?
[34:33.320 --> 34:34.270]  What if we...
[34:34.270 --> 34:37.390]  Latte... cup... cup mold?
[34:37.610 --> 34:38.250]  I don't know what I'm...
[34:38.250 --> 34:41.890]  Oh, there are, it looks like, it looks like we can get like a silicone cup mold.
[34:42.150 --> 34:42.830]  Oh, that's easy.
[34:42.990 --> 34:43.870]  That's, that's what we need, yeah.
[34:44.310 --> 34:46.110]  Latte cup silicone mold.
[34:46.550 --> 34:48.690]  Yeah, I'm trying to find bigger than like shot glasses.
[34:49.070 --> 34:58.390]  Yeah, I mean, dude, honestly, this is like to be able to like make a five inches by two
[34:58.390 --> 35:03.250]  and a half inches is not Gurpler size, but we have to start somewhere more of a proof of concept than
[35:03.250 --> 35:06.010]  anything. This one's, this one's like a latte cup.
[35:06.750 --> 35:09.450]  Oh, a latte cup, a little latte cup Gurpler.
[35:09.570 --> 35:14.550]  Yeah, yeah, like so that way, and we can, and then you can like get coffee with it and it can melt
[35:14.550 --> 35:19.210]  and it'll make your coffee worse. Like that's pretty interesting, right? Like, wouldn't that be,
[35:19.530 --> 35:21.330]  wouldn't that be cool to like make your coffee worse?
[35:22.510 --> 35:24.550]  Wait, what is one inch deep?
[35:25.210 --> 35:28.130]  It's, it's, it's like a mold, I think for...
[35:28.130 --> 35:28.830]  That's not a mold.
[35:29.270 --> 35:30.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:31.190 --> 35:34.970]  Yeah, that was sort of, yeah, silicone mold, it says it.
[35:35.630 --> 35:38.170]  Yeah, but that's just going to be a solid piece.
[35:38.410 --> 35:39.390]  Right here, hold on.
[35:39.390 --> 35:40.990]  Yeah, yeah, check it out, you know.
[35:41.850 --> 35:44.110]  Hold on, I don't know.
[35:44.250 --> 35:44.470]  Yeah.
[35:45.530 --> 35:46.070]  Hold on.
[35:46.250 --> 35:47.630]  Coffee cup silicone mold.
[35:48.490 --> 35:48.970]  Oh, is that where?
[35:49.930 --> 35:50.390]  Yeah, I got it.
[35:50.470 --> 35:50.950]  Let's have a look at this.
[35:51.350 --> 35:52.350]  Yeah, that looks, that's perfect.
[35:52.590 --> 35:53.130]  These are shot glasses.
[35:53.730 --> 35:57.370]  Yeah, I can find shot glass mold, but I'm trying to find something bigger than that.
[35:57.370 --> 36:00.250]  Yeah, I think that's a good sample starter.
[36:01.050 --> 36:01.750]  Test it out.
[36:01.830 --> 36:03.750]  We can definitely make a gumbler with that, right?
[36:03.890 --> 36:04.550]  Yeah, for sure.
[36:04.750 --> 36:05.810]  Yeah, I think so.
[36:06.870 --> 36:07.770]  You can make a bunch of them.
[36:08.430 --> 36:08.670]  Yeah.
[36:09.130 --> 36:10.750]  What would you put in your gumbler, Gavin?
[36:11.350 --> 36:15.110]  Well, if it was that big, I assume I'd put a Bailey's or something.
[36:16.290 --> 36:17.430]  Bailey's in the gumbler?
[36:17.950 --> 36:19.130]  Yeah, yeah, Bailey's on ice.
[36:19.650 --> 36:27.330]  By that, we could build like little tubes full of gummy bear that we could stick into a real
[36:27.330 --> 36:27.730]  gumbler.
[36:27.890 --> 36:29.590]  Like a telescopic gumbler?
[36:29.890 --> 36:32.650]  Yeah, you could freeze it and then that could be your gurple ice.
[36:33.410 --> 36:34.570]  Gumple ice for your gurple.
[36:35.470 --> 36:36.790]  Gumple ice for your gurple.
[36:36.930 --> 36:40.310]  This could be a great format to bring that dodge to the Bov.
[36:41.250 --> 36:42.130]  Oh, Bovril.
[36:42.830 --> 36:46.830]  I would definitely have a Bovril shot out of a gumbler.
[36:49.530 --> 36:50.770]  That's what we gotta do.
[36:51.050 --> 36:53.170]  Have a hot Bovril out of a cold gumbler.
[36:55.750 --> 36:59.210]  Bovril shot out of a gumbler like feels like I'm having a stroke.
[37:00.170 --> 37:04.010]  Yeah, somehow it's a really cool piece of supplemental content that we could now make.
[37:04.130 --> 37:04.850]  Oh, it sounds great.
[37:05.030 --> 37:05.450]  I love it.
[37:05.550 --> 37:06.530]  Oh, should I buy this thing?
[37:06.950 --> 37:07.150]  Yeah.
[37:07.490 --> 37:08.150]  Oh, definitely.
[37:08.870 --> 37:10.830]  Don't buy Eric's one though, I don't know what that is.
[37:11.190 --> 37:11.850]  No, it would work.
[37:14.950 --> 37:16.390]  I found this one.
[37:16.990 --> 37:18.150]  It's a resin cast.
[37:20.150 --> 37:25.190]  So you can sort of like make it's like here's molds and then you pour stuff into the molds.
[37:25.650 --> 37:26.010]  Okay.
[37:26.230 --> 37:31.350]  And then you take the silicone off and then you have a cup.
[37:31.790 --> 37:33.110]  Is that food safe, that one?
[37:33.150 --> 37:34.190]  That's got pencils in it.
[37:35.050 --> 37:36.490]  Yeah, I don't think you have to eat the pencils.
[37:36.710 --> 37:38.650]  Oh, now we're worried about pencils being food safe?
[37:38.650 --> 37:39.290]  No kidding.
[37:39.370 --> 37:40.030]  Now we're worried.
[37:40.790 --> 37:41.610]  All of a sudden.
[37:42.050 --> 37:43.170]  Oh, we got pencils?
[37:43.970 --> 37:45.830]  Yeah, well, I don't know what you're concerned about.
[37:45.990 --> 37:46.350]  Geez.
[37:46.650 --> 37:47.410]  Let me look at this thing.
[37:47.470 --> 37:48.310]  Sorry, I was buying the other one.
[37:48.310 --> 37:49.350]  Let me look at this thing.
[37:49.490 --> 37:49.690]  Okay.
[37:50.430 --> 37:51.510]  There's something to it.
[37:51.970 --> 37:53.710]  I don't know what, but something.
[37:53.830 --> 37:54.210]  What if?
[37:54.470 --> 37:55.490]  No, no, what if this for a mold?
[37:55.610 --> 37:56.370]  Yeah, this will work.
[37:56.790 --> 38:00.330]  No, no, get a big, get an actual Gerpler.
[38:01.410 --> 38:05.250]  Pour the stuff into it, fill it, and then just put a smaller cup in it.
[38:06.750 --> 38:07.150]  Okay.
[38:07.950 --> 38:08.350]  Okay.
[38:08.650 --> 38:08.890]  What?
[38:09.310 --> 38:09.870]  You're a genius.
[38:10.190 --> 38:10.330]  What?
[38:10.670 --> 38:11.150]  Wouldn't that work?
[38:11.710 --> 38:14.970]  I mean, we were talking about pouring it into a Gerpler earlier, but you seemed upset.
[38:15.190 --> 38:17.090]  So we stopped.
[38:17.090 --> 38:20.730]  So we just went down like a different avenue.
[38:21.990 --> 38:24.030]  So we got a lot of different approaches.
[38:24.150 --> 38:25.350]  You can test multiple ways.
[38:25.650 --> 38:29.310]  Does anybody have a Gerpler they want to sacrifice for the testing of this?
[38:29.430 --> 38:30.190]  Gavin has three.
[38:30.510 --> 38:31.550]  Okay, that's a good point.
[38:32.830 --> 38:35.670]  Yeah, but we still need, did we ever make a smaller one?
[38:36.210 --> 38:36.930]  Not yet.
[38:37.530 --> 38:39.490]  No, I always wanted to make Gerple Jr.
[38:40.070 --> 38:45.410]  We just need one that's a similar, similar style, like ratio wise, but a bit smaller
[38:45.410 --> 38:46.990]  to put as the inside of the mold.
[38:47.090 --> 38:50.430]  So we want gummy bears, right?
[38:50.930 --> 38:51.070]  Yep.
[38:51.150 --> 38:51.390]  Yeah.
[38:51.770 --> 38:56.010]  Okay, so there's, there's, I just sent a link for some bulk gummy bears.
[38:56.110 --> 38:59.710]  We can buy, looks like, uh, eight or five pounds here.
[39:00.450 --> 39:01.950]  So that might be good.
[39:02.370 --> 39:02.970]  It's a lot of little Gerples.
[39:03.530 --> 39:04.190]  A lot of gumplers.
[39:04.850 --> 39:06.510]  And then let me see if we can get purple.
[39:06.590 --> 39:08.770]  There are purple gummy bears also in bulk bags.
[39:08.770 --> 39:08.990]  Perfect.
[39:09.130 --> 39:11.490]  So we can do that also.
[39:12.270 --> 39:13.910]  I wonder if Gracie would want to get involved.
[39:14.210 --> 39:16.270]  I was just edited the both of those old videos.
[39:16.270 --> 39:17.890]  The apple pie and the melon one.
[39:18.130 --> 39:20.450]  And, uh, I just really like editing Gracie.
[39:20.730 --> 39:24.170]  Me and Nick saw her yesterday for 100% Eat.
[39:24.230 --> 39:28.250]  And she said that, uh, now that we have a place and everything, she wants to come and play.
[39:28.370 --> 39:31.070]  She calls hanging out and filming stuff, playing.
[39:31.550 --> 39:33.190]  She wants to be in play mode.
[39:33.530 --> 39:36.390]  She wants to, she wants to come and play.
[39:36.750 --> 39:36.830]  Yeah.
[39:36.910 --> 39:40.730]  Why don't you just text her then, uh, gumplers, are you in?
[39:41.650 --> 39:42.130]  Yeah.
[39:42.170 --> 39:42.930]  Text her right now.
[39:42.990 --> 39:44.290]  Are you in for gumplers?
[39:44.550 --> 39:44.810]  Yeah.
[39:45.070 --> 39:45.450]  Okay.
[39:45.450 --> 39:46.110]  All right.
[39:46.230 --> 39:47.050]  I'll text her right now.
[39:47.230 --> 39:51.370]  I'm buying, I'm buying some, uh, different sized gerpal-esque cups for us to try Gavin's way through.
[39:51.370 --> 39:53.330]  Did you order those gummy bears too or no?
[39:53.670 --> 39:54.690]  I haven't ordered the gummy bears.
[39:54.790 --> 40:00.730]  Okay, gumplers, gumplers, question mark, or just gumplers, period, are you in?
[40:00.850 --> 40:01.270]  Question mark.
[40:01.390 --> 40:03.470]  Yes, gumplers, period, are you in?
[40:03.970 --> 40:04.350]  Got it.
[40:05.090 --> 40:05.390]  Okay.
[40:05.850 --> 40:06.250]  I have texted her.
[40:06.250 --> 40:07.690]  She needs to know which show.
[40:08.570 --> 40:11.830]  I just, I just, I wrote exactly what you guys told me.
[40:12.530 --> 40:13.330]  Regulation gumplers.
[40:13.690 --> 40:15.110]  I'll let you know if she texts me back.
[40:15.450 --> 40:16.550]  Okay, good to know.
[40:16.790 --> 40:22.470]  Yeah, how, so are you imagining that like we melt down all the greens in one thing and
[40:22.470 --> 40:28.390]  then purples in the other thing and then we sort of like mix or like what's the...
[40:28.390 --> 40:31.310]  You like pour the green, let it start to solidify, then pour the purple.
[40:31.470 --> 40:31.990]  Oh, really?
[40:32.210 --> 40:33.210]  I'll make it look like an ombre.
[40:33.630 --> 40:33.710]  Yeah.
[40:34.230 --> 40:35.670]  It would look like the gerpal gumpler.
[40:36.250 --> 40:36.670]  Yeah, I see.
[40:36.870 --> 40:37.110]  Okay.
[40:37.810 --> 40:39.810]  Gracie simply said, I beg your pardon.
[40:40.110 --> 40:41.150]  Yeah, that's fair.
[40:41.470 --> 40:42.430]  I said, that's not a yes.
[40:43.230 --> 40:43.990]  It's not a no though.
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.390]  How many bags of this shit do I need to buy?
[40:47.250 --> 40:49.030]  Just one five pound bag each.
[40:49.610 --> 40:51.970]  Okay, one of purple.
[40:52.710 --> 40:56.690]  Yeah, one of purple and then one of one of the green in the link above and that should
[40:56.690 --> 40:57.030]  be fine.
[40:58.270 --> 41:00.470]  Am I saying anything else to Gracie or is that it?
[41:01.170 --> 41:02.230]  I think you're good.
[41:02.550 --> 41:04.030]  I think she's in by the sounds of it.
[41:04.130 --> 41:05.890]  You can clarify with regulation gumpler.
[41:06.630 --> 41:06.950]  Okay.
[41:08.690 --> 41:09.110]  Albany's...
[41:09.110 --> 41:09.390]  Scent.
[41:09.890 --> 41:10.650]  Apple crisp.
[41:10.770 --> 41:12.430]  I got a weird email yesterday.
[41:12.870 --> 41:13.170]  Oh yeah?
[41:13.990 --> 41:22.150]  Got an email from a service saying, hey, your phone number has been attached to a different
[41:22.150 --> 41:22.530]  account.
[41:22.810 --> 41:23.810]  Just a heads up.
[41:23.950 --> 41:28.230]  The phone number on your account was just registered on a different account.
[41:28.610 --> 41:33.910]  As I looked at it, it was one of my old phone numbers that I don't use, obviously, anymore.
[41:34.890 --> 41:36.110]  I thought, oh, that's funny.
[41:36.270 --> 41:39.910]  I guess it's back in service because I had an issue in the past where I went to try to
[41:39.910 --> 41:45.990]  recover an email or something and it was connected to that and I couldn't change it.
[41:46.110 --> 41:48.510]  And I called the number just to see if it was still in service.
[41:48.510 --> 41:50.070]  And it wasn't at that time.
[41:50.570 --> 41:52.910]  So I got the alert saying that someone had used it.
[41:53.210 --> 41:54.210]  So I checked.
[41:54.270 --> 41:55.930]  It was already, it was still saved in my phone.
[41:56.130 --> 41:57.410]  So I just texted them, hey.
[41:58.570 --> 41:59.170]  And then waited.
[41:59.810 --> 42:00.790]  And I got a response back.
[42:00.950 --> 42:01.150]  Your old phone number.
[42:01.490 --> 42:03.190]  Yeah, I just texted my old phone number because it was mine.
[42:03.230 --> 42:03.970]  It was already in my phone.
[42:03.990 --> 42:04.490]  I said, hey.
[42:05.130 --> 42:07.930]  They replied eventually, hi.
[42:08.710 --> 42:10.530]  And then there was a delay.
[42:11.390 --> 42:12.650]  Is this Bob?
[42:12.770 --> 42:16.450]  And then a bunch of like, like messing with you faces.
[42:16.450 --> 42:18.970]  Like, I guess Bob's a prankster, I'm assuming.
[42:19.990 --> 42:24.090]  And then I just replied back that it was me, that I used to have the number.
[42:24.330 --> 42:26.630]  I saw that they had registered just saying hi.
[42:26.690 --> 42:31.070]  If they need me to change any numbers, let them know.
[42:31.170 --> 42:32.030]  Just let me know.
[42:32.030 --> 42:36.710]  If like, I don't know if I'm sitting on something with that number that I'm not using anymore.
[42:36.750 --> 42:38.370]  Like it's just applied to an account and it's blocking.
[42:38.930 --> 42:43.610]  And they said that I guess they're trying to sync their Microsoft account.
[42:43.730 --> 42:46.090]  And it was tied to a Microsoft account of mine.
[42:46.170 --> 42:48.270]  So my name kept popping up.
[42:48.330 --> 42:49.770]  They're already familiar with it.
[42:50.470 --> 42:53.590]  And I thought it was a real pleasant interaction overall.
[42:54.210 --> 42:57.410]  But they have called me four times since then.
[42:57.750 --> 42:59.790]  And I just don't want to talk to this person.
[43:00.110 --> 43:01.170]  It has become an annoyance.
[43:01.170 --> 43:02.730]  Because I texted them.
[43:02.830 --> 43:04.830]  They can text me if they want to, if they need something.
[43:05.150 --> 43:06.150]  Why are they calling me?
[43:07.610 --> 43:08.870]  I think it might be someone who's older.
[43:09.430 --> 43:09.670]  Yeah.
[43:09.850 --> 43:11.050]  But we've texted already.
[43:11.050 --> 43:13.410]  We've gotten like seven texts back and forth.
[43:13.710 --> 43:15.270]  We've both introduced ourselves.
[43:15.830 --> 43:17.450]  I feel like we've set up a rapport.
[43:18.870 --> 43:21.510]  And now they just keep calling and it's annoying.
[43:21.690 --> 43:24.750]  They might think about texting is how you think about phone calls.
[43:25.090 --> 43:26.830]  I think they think that I'm Bob.
[43:26.970 --> 43:29.670]  I don't think they believe that it's not Bob.
[43:29.670 --> 43:31.490]  And they keep calling to...
[43:31.490 --> 43:32.250]  That's my theory.
[43:32.350 --> 43:34.050]  I don't know why else they would be calling me.
[43:34.550 --> 43:35.830]  But why would they think you're Bob?
[43:36.370 --> 43:39.230]  I think that Bob sounds like a real prankster.
[43:39.430 --> 43:43.110]  And I think they just don't believe the story that I told them.
[43:43.150 --> 43:44.570]  That I just used to have that number.
[43:44.990 --> 43:45.730]  And I was just texting.
[43:45.890 --> 43:48.570]  So they think their friend Bob has a different number.
[43:49.090 --> 43:53.370]  I think they think that Bob is pulling a joke on them, is my belief.
[43:53.910 --> 43:54.970]  But they keep calling.
[43:55.190 --> 43:58.030]  They didn't leave a voicemail on any of the calls.
[43:58.030 --> 44:01.530]  They did leave one, but it was like they clearly just didn't hang up in time.
[44:01.690 --> 44:02.870]  They didn't say anything.
[44:03.130 --> 44:06.050]  Can you send like a voice note proving that you're not Bob?
[44:06.730 --> 44:07.470]  Yeah, I guess.
[44:07.710 --> 44:11.310]  That sounds like the kind of thing Bob would engineer to look like it's not him though.
[44:12.410 --> 44:14.150]  Bob's a prankster after all.
[44:14.990 --> 44:18.470]  I would argue the more you try to explain to them you're not Bob,
[44:18.530 --> 44:20.170]  the more they're going to think you're Bob.
[44:20.430 --> 44:23.710]  Yeah, I don't really know what to do because I don't really want to answer their phone call.
[44:24.650 --> 44:26.910]  Oh, I kind of feel like you should.
[44:26.910 --> 44:30.970]  Because I'm also kind of convinced that they're mad at me for some reason.
[44:31.530 --> 44:32.470]  They're mad at you?
[44:32.670 --> 44:36.050]  I don't know. I just feel like that could be a possibility that they want to yell at me.
[44:36.390 --> 44:36.730]  For some reason.
[44:36.730 --> 44:37.050]  What have you done?
[44:37.350 --> 44:38.250]  I haven't done anything.
[44:39.490 --> 44:42.070]  I think they want to yell at me.
[44:42.510 --> 44:45.450]  Do you think you could get in touch with Bob yourself?
[44:46.150 --> 44:49.390]  Oh, it's a pretty, pretty common name, unfortunately.
[44:50.150 --> 44:52.370]  I don't know how I track down just Bob.
[44:52.790 --> 44:55.350]  Well, you'd have to check him down through their social media probably.
[44:55.910 --> 45:00.650]  I see. This is I don't know. I feel like it's getting deeper than I care about.
[45:00.770 --> 45:01.410]  I beg your pardon.
[45:03.810 --> 45:06.470]  I'll take one if that's the question is Gracie.
[45:06.570 --> 45:08.350]  Gracie just says that she'll just take a Gurpler.
[45:09.570 --> 45:12.170]  Just say we have to make them.
[45:12.650 --> 45:13.110]  Oh, yeah.
[45:13.450 --> 45:14.750]  Text her if she knows Bob.
[45:16.410 --> 45:17.830]  Maybe she can connect us.
[45:19.650 --> 45:21.550]  We have to make them.
[45:21.790 --> 45:21.950]  Okay.
[45:22.790 --> 45:23.030]  Yeah.
[45:23.170 --> 45:24.870]  Yeah. Or we have to make them first.
[45:24.870 --> 45:27.570]  Do you want me to say do we have to make them? Do you want to help?
[45:28.130 --> 45:28.910]  Yeah, do you want to?
[45:29.090 --> 45:30.090]  Yeah, there you go.
[45:30.130 --> 45:33.510]  Because then she's now now she's successfully tricked into doing something.
[45:33.950 --> 45:34.790]  Yeah, perfect.
[45:35.490 --> 45:40.050]  Have you ever thought that maybe the universe is trying to get you to be this Bob?
[45:40.590 --> 45:41.230]  It could be.
[45:41.310 --> 45:45.570]  Like maybe it's a sort of a touched by an angel situation where you're going to show up in their
[45:45.570 --> 45:51.650]  lives or even like Quantum Leap and provide some sort of a, you know, service to a family in need
[45:51.650 --> 45:53.630]  that helps them along in their journey.
[45:53.630 --> 45:54.770]  Well, here's the thing.
[45:54.870 --> 45:59.830]  I technically don't know if it's them calling me because they were all private number calls.
[46:00.050 --> 46:01.390]  It just said private number.
[46:02.090 --> 46:04.550]  Wait, you think just a withheld number is them?
[46:04.890 --> 46:09.430]  I assume so, because like, what are the odds that I text a random person and then I also
[46:10.230 --> 46:14.450]  receive four private number calls on the same day?
[46:14.570 --> 46:18.030]  My phone rings all the time with just random numbers and private numbers.
[46:18.170 --> 46:19.630]  I don't see it doesn't for me.
[46:19.930 --> 46:21.590]  I almost never get private.
[46:21.590 --> 46:24.270]  Should I text them and ask if they're calling me?
[46:24.950 --> 46:25.110]  Yeah.
[46:25.410 --> 46:25.810]  Yeah.
[46:25.950 --> 46:26.830]  I'll do that right now.
[46:26.950 --> 46:29.250]  Sorry, I missed a few calls.
[46:29.730 --> 46:31.190]  Ask them if they want a gumbler.
[46:31.930 --> 46:37.570]  The most insane part of this to me is that this person is unknowingly texting someone
[46:37.570 --> 46:43.390]  assuming they're Bob, but this person has an alter ego who is a prankster named Johnny
[46:43.390 --> 46:43.830]  Caviar.
[46:43.970 --> 46:46.030]  So they just think it's the wrong jokester.
[46:46.650 --> 46:46.970]  Yeah.
[46:47.870 --> 46:49.650]  They're talking to a jokester.
[46:49.650 --> 46:50.930]  Oh my god!
[46:51.430 --> 46:51.830]  Four...
[46:51.830 --> 46:55.130]  This is like when you try to hire an assassin, but you hire the wrong assassin, but they're
[46:55.130 --> 46:55.790]  still an assassin.
[47:00.870 --> 47:02.710]  Yeah, I'll see if they reply.
[47:03.330 --> 47:05.510]  What does a text to an assassin look like?
[47:05.610 --> 47:07.290]  Is it just like a name, a picture?
[47:08.450 --> 47:09.930]  Probably like GPS coordinates.
[47:10.410 --> 47:11.630]  Yeah, like what if you just got one?
[47:11.670 --> 47:15.030]  Would you think, oh, I guess I should just be an assassin today?
[47:15.230 --> 47:17.310]  I should just go to this location and kill whoever's there?
[47:18.190 --> 47:19.070]  Or warn them.
[47:19.070 --> 47:20.630]  Or warn them, yeah.
[47:22.130 --> 47:25.310]  I think if I just got randomly...
[47:26.570 --> 47:32.570]  If I just randomly got GPS coordinates, like latitude and longitude, and just a little
[47:32.570 --> 47:40.870]  picture of a emoji of a green light, I'm running as far away from those coordinates
[47:40.870 --> 47:41.650]  as humanly possible.
[47:42.190 --> 47:43.770]  That's the last place on earth I need to be.
[47:44.010 --> 47:46.310]  I think you gotta Google where it is first and then...
[47:46.310 --> 47:47.330]  Oh yeah, of course, of course.
[47:47.990 --> 47:49.810]  Oh, fuck, it's three blocks away.
[47:50.170 --> 47:52.970]  It's just a text saying, yeah, so I thought about it.
[47:53.050 --> 47:54.550]  I don't think we should kill Bob.
[47:55.290 --> 47:57.010]  It's like the most menacing...
[47:58.350 --> 48:01.330]  What's the best random text any of you have ever gotten?
[48:02.210 --> 48:03.290]  You ever get a good one?
[48:04.910 --> 48:05.990]  Mine are blocked, typically.
[48:07.330 --> 48:14.330]  Yeah, I got one earlier, a random text earlier today asking if I wanted to pay for some recipes
[48:14.330 --> 48:16.490]  for somebody's cookbook.
[48:16.490 --> 48:17.730]  It was some sort of spam.
[48:18.090 --> 48:19.850]  I didn't do that.
[48:20.830 --> 48:22.270]  Pay for recipes?
[48:22.950 --> 48:30.910]  Yeah, it was like a, hi, I'm so-and-so, and I'm trying to use my family's recipes to
[48:31.830 --> 48:32.550]  further myself.
[48:32.790 --> 48:35.330]  And if you are interested and want to buy my recipe...
[48:35.330 --> 48:36.390]  I don't know, I didn't read the whole thing.
[48:36.470 --> 48:36.850]  It was just like...
[48:36.850 --> 48:37.250]  Are they potions?
[48:37.750 --> 48:38.590]  Reported as junk food.
[48:38.590 --> 48:39.350]  Yeah, what kind of recipes?
[48:39.430 --> 48:40.630]  I wonder what kind of recipes...
[48:40.630 --> 48:42.910]  You assume it's food, but it's got to be magic.
[48:43.130 --> 48:45.530]  Is there a way to look at deleted texts?
[48:46.490 --> 48:47.130]  Probably not.
[48:47.910 --> 48:54.650]  My partner has a funny problem where somebody has mistaken their phone number for...
[48:57.090 --> 48:58.670]  Like, they're giving out the wrong number.
[48:58.770 --> 49:03.330]  They keep giving my partner's phone number to people thinking it's their number.
[49:04.210 --> 49:08.490]  And so they're constantly getting texts from, like, friends of this person,
[49:08.730 --> 49:10.810]  and or things that they've signed up for.
[49:11.390 --> 49:13.950]  But it's largely friends, and they just ignore it.
[49:13.950 --> 49:16.850]  And if it was me, oh man, would I be getting in the mix?
[49:17.190 --> 49:18.910]  How are they doing that multiple times?
[49:19.030 --> 49:22.470]  Maybe they saved themselves as a contact with the wrong number?
[49:22.930 --> 49:25.430]  Like, surely you wouldn't say the wrong number.
[49:25.830 --> 49:27.670]  I think you could easily say the wrong number.
[49:28.170 --> 49:31.830]  I could absolutely imagine me getting my number wrong by, like,
[49:31.830 --> 49:34.810]  one digit or, like, accidentally flipping it when I say it.
[49:35.330 --> 49:37.450]  Yeah, but wrong in the same way multiple times?
[49:37.930 --> 49:38.710]  I think so, yeah.
[49:38.730 --> 49:42.690]  If I just lock it in in the wrong way, I absolutely could see myself doing that.
[49:42.810 --> 49:43.450]  That's me.
[49:43.950 --> 49:47.670]  I feel like this is a problem that is not nearly as prevalent
[49:47.670 --> 49:49.930]  as it used to be earlier in my lifetime,
[49:50.170 --> 49:53.090]  when you would get wrong numbers constantly back in the days
[49:53.090 --> 49:55.590]  when people had to recite or write down phone numbers.
[49:55.910 --> 49:59.190]  But now, like, if you meet somebody and you want to get each other's phone number,
[49:59.190 --> 50:02.090]  you just text them and then you save their contact information, right?
[50:02.150 --> 50:03.170]  You, like, never...
[50:03.170 --> 50:05.710]  I would imagine a lot of people don't even know their own phone number.
[50:06.270 --> 50:07.510]  Oh, I didn't for a long time.
[50:07.990 --> 50:12.030]  I know. I know mine, my wife's, my daughter's, and Bernie's for some reason.
[50:12.270 --> 50:12.950]  I can't forget it.
[50:18.170 --> 50:22.570]  I've lived in this country so long, I started to forget my UK phone number,
[50:22.730 --> 50:26.670]  and the one that's replaced it is my first UK phone number.
[50:27.130 --> 50:27.470]  Oh.
[50:27.530 --> 50:30.770]  Because I'm on my second number in the UK, and that one's gone,
[50:30.870 --> 50:33.750]  and I remember the first one, which is completely useless to me.
[50:33.970 --> 50:35.030]  I don't know why that one stuck.
[50:35.390 --> 50:38.290]  It's like I remember my locker combination for sixth grade,
[50:38.350 --> 50:39.990]  but I don't remember any other locker combination.
[50:41.970 --> 50:42.610]  What was it?
[50:42.630 --> 50:43.530]  11-36-13.
[50:44.910 --> 50:45.350]  Wow.
[50:47.090 --> 50:51.250]  11-36-13. I've never used it on anything else, but I can't get it out of my head.
[50:51.370 --> 50:55.850]  And any time I look at a new, like, twisty lock, I'm like, ah, fuck. 11-36-13.
[50:56.410 --> 50:59.170]  It is hard to forget the first stuff you remember.
[50:59.770 --> 51:00.050]  Yeah.
[51:00.250 --> 51:02.130]  I still remember the first thing I was impressed by.
[51:02.750 --> 51:04.750]  What was the first thing you were impressed by?
[51:05.090 --> 51:05.290]  What?
[51:08.250 --> 51:08.950]  I need to know.
[51:08.950 --> 51:12.590]  I think as a kid, you're often impressed by stuff that's shit.
[51:13.050 --> 51:13.250]  Yeah.
[51:13.250 --> 51:17.750]  But it's just the first time you've seen it. So it's like, whoa, I was impressed by a wet book.
[51:18.250 --> 51:18.950]  What do you mean?
[51:19.010 --> 51:23.590]  It was a book that had been rained on and it dried all like wavy.
[51:23.810 --> 51:28.190]  I was like, that is brilliant. It's like a book, but it's wavy.
[51:28.890 --> 51:34.330]  I think you almost don't know what impressed means.
[51:35.170 --> 51:37.410]  What do you mean? I thought it was great.
[51:38.070 --> 51:38.870]  That's crazy.
[51:39.330 --> 51:42.550]  I used to take it out of the bookcase and show it to people when they came over.
[51:42.550 --> 51:42.870]  What?
[51:46.130 --> 51:49.470]  It was one of the first weird things I saw.
[51:49.850 --> 51:51.930]  I was probably three, maybe four.
[51:52.970 --> 51:58.550]  Nick, could you imagine your kid doing that? Just going like, look, look at this book.
[51:58.750 --> 51:59.550]  Look at this.
[51:59.570 --> 52:00.310]  It used to be wet.
[52:00.910 --> 52:03.110]  Can you believe the rain's done this?
[52:03.690 --> 52:05.130]  It was one of my mom's books.
[52:05.450 --> 52:06.890]  Was it during the silent seers?
[52:07.690 --> 52:07.950]  Yeah.
[52:10.410 --> 52:12.490]  It's like a cartoon character.
[52:13.390 --> 52:16.690]  No, I just remember finding out from my mom, it was left out in the rain.
[52:17.030 --> 52:19.550]  And it was like the thing in the house.
[52:19.690 --> 52:20.630]  You're leaving books out.
[52:22.550 --> 52:24.070]  You know, this explains a lot.
[52:24.090 --> 52:26.230]  Because last time I was talking to your mom, I asked her,
[52:26.610 --> 52:29.530]  do you ever think like when Gavin was a small kid,
[52:29.590 --> 52:30.670]  like what he'd be when he grew up?
[52:30.690 --> 52:32.190]  And she was like, she was real quiet for a second.
[52:32.270 --> 52:34.150]  She goes, you know, honestly, I never did.
[52:34.250 --> 52:35.170]  And now I understand why.
[52:35.370 --> 52:36.750]  I don't think they had high hopes.
[52:37.470 --> 52:38.790]  Do you think you still have the book?
[52:39.390 --> 52:40.750]  They were like, oh, Christ.
[52:41.130 --> 52:43.590]  Grammy's going to come over and Gavin's going to bring out the wet book again.
[52:43.750 --> 52:45.070]  The wet book.
[52:45.150 --> 52:46.670]  Well, it wasn't wet anymore.
[52:46.850 --> 52:47.970]  It was just was once wet.
[52:48.370 --> 52:49.870]  Yeah, no, we get it.
[52:50.010 --> 52:50.930]  We get it.
[52:51.310 --> 52:51.570]  Yeah.
[52:51.850 --> 52:54.370]  Did you ever try to wet it again to make it go back to normal?
[52:54.810 --> 52:55.010]  No.
[52:55.990 --> 52:56.970]  Did you heat it up?
[52:58.270 --> 52:58.630]  No.
[52:59.510 --> 53:03.610]  Oh, I was also impressed by, uh, um, like pool cues.
[53:04.370 --> 53:07.330]  Like watching the bird up up front on someone's hand.
[53:07.430 --> 53:08.990]  I was like, is it doing that on its own?
[53:08.990 --> 53:10.750]  Is he pushing it?
[53:10.910 --> 53:11.890]  I was like, that's amazing.
[53:12.110 --> 53:14.430]  I used to love watching people play pool.
[53:14.950 --> 53:16.490]  I used to love watching wheels go around.
[53:16.590 --> 53:17.270]  I love the wet book.
[53:17.850 --> 53:19.370]  Like you don't have anything like that.
[53:19.430 --> 53:21.170]  That's like really regular shitty stuff.
[53:21.510 --> 53:25.790]  Somebody just clipped that sentence where Gavin said all the things that are possible.
[53:26.170 --> 53:28.030]  Like a wheel go round and wet book.
[53:28.350 --> 53:29.650]  I thought they were brilliant.
[53:29.930 --> 53:31.350]  Honestly, I thought they were so good.
[53:31.750 --> 53:32.730]  Dude, this is...
[53:33.270 --> 53:33.710]  What?
[53:33.990 --> 53:37.230]  I wish I did, Gav, but I was too busy slamming my dick in the toilets.
[53:39.570 --> 53:41.490]  I was on a different path than you.
[53:41.850 --> 53:44.030]  See, I would rather whip that out than what you were doing.
[53:44.630 --> 53:46.610]  I don't think I had anything like that.
[53:47.190 --> 53:48.930]  I definitely didn't have a wet book.
[53:49.690 --> 53:50.970]  I love that you have...
[53:51.690 --> 53:54.250]  You were surely impressed by something at an early age.
[53:54.270 --> 53:54.430]  Definitely.
[53:54.810 --> 53:54.950]  Kind of.
[53:55.490 --> 53:55.850]  Absolutely.
[53:56.450 --> 53:58.150]  I just, I didn't have like a go-to.
[54:00.150 --> 54:03.810]  There wasn't like a thing I would show people and be like, look at this fucking crazy.
[54:04.730 --> 54:06.030]  You see the waves on this page?
[54:06.430 --> 54:11.110]  We've talked in the past about my go-to story as a kid was when the wind rang the doorbell.
[54:11.490 --> 54:11.610]  Yeah.
[54:13.150 --> 54:15.410]  And now they just get stuck. They just get burned in.
[54:15.870 --> 54:18.010]  You see, I opened the door and there was nobody there.
[54:19.610 --> 54:19.970]  Crazy.
[54:21.830 --> 54:24.550]  I immediately turned around and started reading my wet book.
[54:27.970 --> 54:29.710]  Do you remember what the book was?
[54:30.490 --> 54:30.950]  Oh yeah.
[54:31.010 --> 54:32.970]  It was like a thick book? Was it a small book?
[54:33.190 --> 54:34.470]  It was probably like an inch thick.
[54:34.890 --> 54:35.170]  Okay.
[54:35.690 --> 54:37.370]  Do you think your family still has it?
[54:37.890 --> 54:41.230]  I don't know. People don't really throw books away. It might have been donated.
[54:41.250 --> 54:43.470]  Not a wet book. Not donating that.
[54:44.390 --> 54:47.570]  To be honest, if there was a point where my mom was like,
[54:47.670 --> 54:50.770]  oh, I'm going to get rid of all these old books and I was my age now,
[54:50.810 --> 54:52.530]  I would have a quick rummage for the wet one.
[54:52.930 --> 54:55.150]  You have to. You have to find the one.
[54:56.030 --> 54:57.510]  The foundational moment in your life.
[54:57.650 --> 55:01.390]  Well, yeah. And when people come over, you have to have something to show them.
[55:01.950 --> 55:07.190]  Now you, you left out the part where you pissed on this book, right? Like that's how it got wet.
[55:07.470 --> 55:09.590]  Yeah, it's a piss book. Yeah, it's a piss book.
[55:09.590 --> 55:13.770]  I wasn't really like a wrong pisser. I just pissed my pants in the toilet like a normal kid.
[55:15.050 --> 55:16.670]  Do you have any other wet opinions?
[55:18.650 --> 55:21.790]  You have a positive wet and a negative wet, which I didn't expect.
[55:22.250 --> 55:23.990]  I think most wet is negative.
[55:24.490 --> 55:28.530]  He also likes, you also like wet works though, right? We talked about that forever ago.
[55:29.550 --> 55:30.350]  Wet works?
[55:30.810 --> 55:35.690]  Yeah, I think it was in the, we were talking about Johnny Mnemonic or something in sci-fi.
[55:36.190 --> 55:36.610]  Yeah, wet wear.
[55:37.070 --> 55:41.750]  Yeah, wet wear is brilliant. It's how they attach the wires to the rat or something.
[55:42.170 --> 55:43.910]  You think you could recreate the wavy book?
[55:45.230 --> 55:45.590]  No.
[55:46.570 --> 55:49.190]  I was going to say next time it rains, you should throw a book out there.
[55:49.670 --> 55:50.870]  Well, what book am I going to sacrifice?
[55:52.130 --> 55:55.110]  You got one fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish or what?
[55:56.630 --> 55:59.190]  Oh, I've got like a philosopher's stone I could leave out there.
[55:59.190 --> 55:59.830]  There you go.
[55:59.850 --> 56:00.770]  Yeah, go ahead.
[56:00.930 --> 56:02.370]  Feel free to piss on that one too.
[56:02.990 --> 56:03.350]  Yeah.
[56:05.130 --> 56:07.590]  Not because it's a bad book, just because I want you to piss on something.
[56:07.890 --> 56:08.130]  Yeah.
[56:08.910 --> 56:10.090]  That's a weird request.
[56:10.850 --> 56:11.210]  Yeah.
[56:11.930 --> 56:13.730]  Geoff's really locked into the fetish content.
[56:15.170 --> 56:19.030]  Do you think a book that dried from pee would dry differently than a book that dried from rain?
[56:19.530 --> 56:20.130]  Different color.
[56:20.630 --> 56:22.490]  I mean, only one way to find out.
[56:23.370 --> 56:24.730]  I don't think I need to know.
[56:25.590 --> 56:27.370]  I mean, maybe I'll piss on it after.
[56:28.030 --> 56:29.210]  You guys are weird.
[56:29.370 --> 56:30.630]  Let's talk about kittens again.
[56:31.710 --> 56:33.550]  Gracie texted back and just said when.
[56:34.470 --> 56:34.710]  Sweet.
[56:35.470 --> 56:36.550]  I didn't get a text back.
[56:37.470 --> 56:38.350]  Oh, bummer.
[56:38.570 --> 56:38.750]  Yeah.
[56:38.990 --> 56:39.490]  Sorry, man.
[56:40.010 --> 56:44.550]  I think, by the way, I think I discovered where it all went wrong for humanity.
[56:45.690 --> 56:50.970]  I feel like people are pretty much unhappy no matter where they are these days.
[56:51.210 --> 56:53.030]  And I think it's to do with Pluto.
[56:53.030 --> 56:58.030]  I think when Pluto got declassified, humanity got less happy.
[56:58.310 --> 56:59.390]  Because we lost a planet?
[57:00.030 --> 57:00.450]  Yeah.
[57:00.550 --> 57:00.770]  Yeah.
[57:00.950 --> 57:06.590]  Like some mysticism went away where the planets were magical and unalterable,
[57:06.750 --> 57:09.030]  and then we altered the planets and now things are different.
[57:09.410 --> 57:11.450]  Feel kind of that way about Brontosaurus too.
[57:12.390 --> 57:13.270]  Oh, wow.
[57:13.850 --> 57:16.830]  So I think we should, even though they're wrong, like even though I think there's like bigger
[57:16.830 --> 57:21.250]  stuff than Pluto that's not a planet and there's like better orbits than Pluto that isn't a planet,
[57:21.250 --> 57:27.310]  I think we should just try for a year putting it back in and seeing if it's good for morale.
[57:28.090 --> 57:29.210]  See, I feel the opposite.
[57:29.390 --> 57:31.510]  I don't care at all about the planets.
[57:32.470 --> 57:36.510]  I think if Saturn went away, totally unaffected by it.
[57:38.270 --> 57:39.510]  Saturn's the cool one, man.
[57:40.210 --> 57:41.010]  Saturn's a banger.
[57:41.110 --> 57:41.530]  What do you mean?
[57:42.490 --> 57:43.590]  That's a top-tier planet, dude.
[57:43.630 --> 57:44.430]  It's a gas giant.
[57:44.530 --> 57:45.090]  It floats.
[57:45.190 --> 57:45.830]  It's got a ring.
[57:46.210 --> 57:49.730]  Yeah, I'm not saying it's not a good planet, but let's say Saturn vanished.
[57:49.850 --> 57:50.370]  It disappeared.
[57:50.830 --> 57:51.690]  I wouldn't care.
[57:52.970 --> 57:55.150]  I wouldn't even be aware that it happened.
[57:55.290 --> 57:57.650]  My life would just continue on and then someone would say,
[57:57.730 --> 57:58.750]  hey, you hear about Saturn?
[57:58.890 --> 57:59.570]  I'd say no.
[58:00.150 --> 58:01.450]  And they'd tell me and I'd go...
[58:01.450 --> 58:03.970]  You could say the same for like a guy somewhere.
[58:04.790 --> 58:05.190]  What?
[58:05.810 --> 58:06.830]  Maybe his name's Saturn.
[58:08.710 --> 58:10.450]  Steven Saturn is gone.
[58:10.650 --> 58:11.650]  Did he get left out in the rain?
[58:12.570 --> 58:14.230]  Yeah, somebody pissed on him.
[58:14.310 --> 58:18.030]  What if there was some like guy, he lives in Latvia, you've never met him,
[58:18.050 --> 58:18.930]  you never will, he vanished.
[58:19.270 --> 58:20.250]  Wouldn't change your life at all.
[58:20.370 --> 58:23.270]  I'd be way more impacted by that than the planet.
[58:23.710 --> 58:24.850]  OK, it just happened.
[58:25.390 --> 58:26.210]  That sucks.
[58:26.570 --> 58:30.610]  I hope he gets found, I guess.
[58:30.730 --> 58:33.110]  What about all the aliens that are secretly living on Saturn?
[58:33.490 --> 58:34.690]  Whole communities, families.
[58:35.610 --> 58:35.930]  Potentially.
[58:36.570 --> 58:38.110]  Saturn has some good moons as well.
[58:38.190 --> 58:38.510]  Does.
[58:39.030 --> 58:39.930]  I've played Starfield.
[58:40.130 --> 58:41.050]  There was nothing there.
[58:41.230 --> 58:41.890]  That was an empty one.
[58:42.290 --> 58:44.750]  What happens to the moons when the planet blinks out?
[58:45.290 --> 58:48.330]  Yeah, what if it hurled one of its moons back across the solar system
[58:48.330 --> 58:50.090]  because it's not orbiting Saturn anymore?
[58:50.370 --> 58:52.270]  That sounds like a problem for someone.
[58:52.870 --> 58:53.170]  For you.
[58:53.370 --> 58:54.210]  It could be a problem for you.
[58:54.710 --> 58:55.290]  Well, it could be.
[58:55.370 --> 58:56.890]  Then I'd be really worried about it.
[59:01.270 --> 59:03.090]  I'm not saying we should remove Saturn.
[59:03.210 --> 59:06.990]  I'm just saying that unless like there was some effect to the Earth,
[59:07.110 --> 59:10.150]  it would really, it just wouldn't move me.
[59:10.850 --> 59:12.110]  I'm indifferent to planets.
[59:12.650 --> 59:14.850]  So where do you think it all went wrong, Andrew?
[59:15.130 --> 59:17.290]  If it's not the brontosaurus and it's not Saturn.
[59:17.750 --> 59:19.730]  Losing it, I think is the...
[59:21.410 --> 59:23.990]  We've never recovered as a society.
[59:24.290 --> 59:25.430]  That was before you were born.
[59:25.670 --> 59:27.310]  So that means, does that mean you've never been happy?
[59:28.310 --> 59:29.870]  No, I've definitely been happy.
[59:29.990 --> 59:33.790]  I don't think my happiness, though, is an indicator of where things went wrong.
[59:34.510 --> 59:37.830]  Do you think you were more happy or less happy before 2007?
[59:38.830 --> 59:39.930]  Oh, way more happy.
[59:40.650 --> 59:41.730]  I'm telling you.
[59:42.210 --> 59:43.050]  Significantly happier.
[59:44.190 --> 59:45.070]  Post-2007.
[59:45.690 --> 59:46.710]  Oh, post-2007.
[59:46.730 --> 59:48.290]  Post-2007, yeah, way happier.
[59:48.510 --> 59:48.930]  Oh, sorry.
[59:49.310 --> 59:52.870]  I thought, didn't everything go wrong when we turned on the Hadron Collider?
[59:52.990 --> 59:54.830]  Wasn't that what, what screwed us all?
[59:55.710 --> 59:56.730]  Now we're all dead or something.
[59:57.130 --> 59:58.590]  Or we're in an alternate universe or.
[59:59.290 --> 59:59.610]  Possibly.
[59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.670]  Everything got all muxed up.
[01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.710]  Yeah, I don't care about any of that.
[01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:07.110]  If the Mandela effect, like if it was confirmed somehow that we were,
[01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.290]  we shifted universes, don't care.
[01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:10.810]  Doesn't matter.
[01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.130]  I feel like that would be podcast material.
[01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:14.990]  I feel like that'd be interesting to talk about.
[01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.330]  It would be interesting to talk about, but it's like, I don't, I don't really care.
[01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:21.770]  Like, if it was confirmed that there are multiverses, right?
[01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:25.310]  Or there are at least multiple universes that live in parallel to ours.
[01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.810]  Wouldn't it be fun to try to postulate like how.
[01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.210]  Yes.
[01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:32.510]  The planet next to us is just slightly different.
[01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.970]  Like, Justin Bieber has black hair, but everything else is the same.
[01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:41.790]  I would wonder if there were more versions of me that don't like pants or less.
[01:00:42.310 --> 01:00:44.990]  Right. Get into like the Rick and Morty of it.
[01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:52.510]  Am I like in the minority of that take of me's or is like 90% me against pants?
[01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:56.490]  Because they're an Andrew out there in the universe that only wears flannel.
[01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:57.910]  Fucking crazy.
[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:01.010]  When was the last time you popped on a pair of trousers?
[01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.770]  We've talked about this. It's been over a decade.
[01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:05.610]  Holy shit.
[01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.610]  20, you know what? 2015.
[01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.830]  2015 was the last. It's been exactly a decade.
[01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.050]  When did destiny come out?
[01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:18.570]  2014.
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.710]  2014.
[01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:24.810]  2014 was the last time he puts on pants for video game launches.
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.370]  I was, you know, I was working at a warehouse and it was before Destiny's
[01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:32.630]  launch and they were being audited. So they made me put pants on.
[01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:38.530]  Did you have to buy that pair of pants for the audit?
[01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:44.770]  Yes. I had audit sweats and I wore them for three days and then went back to my
[01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:45.190]  shorts.
[01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.310]  Do you still have your audit sweats?
[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:52.750]  I might. You know what? I just got rid of a bunch of stuff. I don't know if I got rid of my audit
[01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:53.110]  sweats.
[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:57.710]  What's a... let's do a check-in. What's the situation with your headboard? Is it still
[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:58.110]  downstairs?
[01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:02.190]  It's halfway up. It's halfway there. Made progress.
[01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:06.170]  What was the reasoning behind finally getting around to it and then stopping halfway?
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:11.770]  Because I still need to adjust some things in here.
[01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:18.630]  I'm completely changing out my storage situation and my closet. I'm making more
[01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:24.210]  space. And once everything else is cleaned up, pulling it up.
[01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.130]  You're just not to that step in the project yet.
[01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:31.950]  Exactly. Yeah, it's this whole upper level is changing. It's there's a lot of shifting,
[01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:33.590]  getting rid of beds and stuff.
[01:02:33.690 --> 01:02:41.230]  So when you say when you say it's halfway up, it immediately calls to mind a headboard
[01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:45.990]  precariously hanging halfway up a five stairs. I'm assuming that's not the case. You mean
[01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:50.450]  that the work upstairs is halfway complete before you can then bring the headboard up?
[01:02:50.890 --> 01:02:51.170]  Yes.
[01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.070]  Okay.
[01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:54.390]  That is a insane way of saying that.
[01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:58.510]  You know, I just learned that Pluto went away. And so I've been really thrilled.
[01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:00.410]  He's still reeling. He's still reeling from the information.
[01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:01.650]  I apologize. That's on me.
[01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.570]  Just to be clear, it's still there. The actual ball.
[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:09.530]  Yeah, but it's not a planet, right? So.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.070]  If you had to blow up one planet, which one do you pick?
[01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:21.270]  Whoa, it was not. They said it was not. That's crazy. Then who called me four times?
[01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:25.930]  Who the fuck was that? That's now we got a mystery.
[01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:28.550]  See, now that sounds like a cool you should have answered.
[01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:31.730]  Now I got to answer this private call. This is crazy.
[01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:33.330]  I hope they call again.
[01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:36.550]  Who keeps calling me? That's yeah.
[01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:41.810]  Before we wrap up, I have one more clip that I think is really funny.
[01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:43.130]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:48.050]  I got a clip. And to be specific, the audience has a clip.
[01:03:48.970 --> 01:03:50.330]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:52.910]  Gavis has a blow up a planet, too.
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:59.590]  He does. I have a I have a counter to this, but it's still very funny.
[01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:01.330]  This is the clip.
[01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:06.010]  Andrew is always asking very inquisitive questions while I play Halo.
[01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.050]  He said, you know, get to know each other, even still to this point.
[01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.070]  Of course, he asked me why I was interested in or how I got into slow-mo.
[01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:16.970]  What made me interested? And I said it was an episode of Tom and Jerry.
[01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:18.190]  Great episode.
[01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:22.370]  Great episode. I want to obviously that was in reference to me
[01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.270]  bashing the Australian morning show.
[01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.670]  Seems like a real dogshit question there, Andrew.
[01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:29.950]  Yeah, I mean, that's hilarious. I would argue two things.
[01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:34.830]  One, I was asking more about your interest generally, not how you started your channel.
[01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:39.210]  Second of all, I did not ask you to do an interview.
[01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:42.230]  This was not we weren't conducting an interview. We're just playing Halo.
[01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.770]  It's just yeah, but you want to be to answer the question.
[01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:46.930]  Otherwise, yeah, but it was small talk. It's different.
[01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:51.070]  But his time with you in that moment was infinite and he wasn't looking at the clock.
[01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.730]  I'm sure if you said now Gavin only has time for seven more questions,
[01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:54.770]  that probably wouldn't have come up.
[01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:58.950]  No, I would not ask that question if I was conducting a proper interview with Gavin.
[01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:00.450]  I would not ask that.
[01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:03.530]  Very interesting audience there with a banger clip.
[01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:07.870]  It was. Yeah, I just replied with like a huge string of laughter. It was great.
[01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:08.650]  I laughed so hard.
[01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:13.350]  Also, I don't have it, but I hear there's a clip of like a year ago of Gavin betting
[01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:17.770]  Eric $100 that GTA 6 won't get delayed into 2026.
[01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:19.330]  Who bet which way?
[01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:21.290]  I thought it. Didn't I say that it would get delayed?
[01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.090]  I think he said that it wouldn't. I don't know. I'd have to go find the clip.
[01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:25.090]  I saw it on Reddit this morning.
[01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:25.810]  Here's the thing.
[01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:26.210]  Really?
[01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:31.710]  If it's getting if if Gavin said it's not getting delayed and I said it is,
[01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.450]  then I'm happy with this bet.
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:40.050]  But if it was the other way, I don't think it happened. I don't remember it.
[01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:44.210]  Similar sort of vibe you bring to Pico Park there.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:46.450]  Yeah, you know, it is what it is.
[01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:49.170]  Laughing with this thing on is so painful.
[01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.330]  Oh, are we ending with behind the mask?
[01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:52.790]  Oh, wow.
[01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.870]  Real quick, Gavin, why are you blowing up Mars?
[01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:56.370]  I don't think I would do Mars.
[01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:57.450]  I hope not.
[01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:58.490]  That's a big one.
[01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.690]  I just learned that Mercury has a tail.
[01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:02.170]  That's pretty cool.
[01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.790]  Yeah.
[01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:04.850]  In her hair.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:09.690]  See, when I put my mask on, it's not going to sound as funny.
[01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:10.310]  Shall I go and get mine?
[01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:11.390]  Yeah, please do.
[01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:15.290]  Nellie, did you fall from a shooting star?
[01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.050]  Can you breathe better in it or?
[01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:25.090]  When I'm not talking.
[01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:29.610]  You sound like Bane.
[01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.210]  I was behind in the sleep.
[01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:38.730]  Is that what Bane's fucking whole beef was?
[01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.050]  He needed a CPAP?
[01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.350]  He's got the apnea the whole time, dude.
[01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:42.950]  That's crazy.
[01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.510]  Wow, he never had good sleep.
[01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.190]  Poor bastard.
[01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:46.730]  No wonder he's cranky.
[01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:47.490]  Yeah.
[01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:49.730]  I can make it worse, actually.
[01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:51.150]  One sec, I'll be right back.
[01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:55.250]  I think Neptune's the prettiest planet, but I might...
[01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.850]  I don't know, Uranus seems obvious.
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.190]  It's a stupid name.
[01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.050]  Yeah.
[01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:02.710]  But I think I'll get rid of that.
[01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:04.810]  Do you really say Uranus?
[01:07:05.410 --> 01:07:06.890]  I guess I say Uranus.
[01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.110]  I don't know, Uranus.
[01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:09.290]  I'm a big Uranus guy.
[01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.010]  Either way, I'm...
[01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:11.890]  Yeah, I bet you are.
[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:13.170]  Uh-huh.
[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.890]  All right, I'm on the path.
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.530]  Okay, Andrew, you back?
[01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:20.130]  One sec.
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:27.890]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to get a preview of a brand new show from the Regulation
[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:34.290]  Podcast Company. Very excited about this one. I think that this has never been attempted before
[01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:38.970]  in the history of podcasting, and we're going to be on the forefront, leading the edge. As you know,
[01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:44.510]  we are a self-help and wellness podcast, and we try to promote wellness. And one of the ways that
[01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:52.250]  we're doing that is to de-stigmatize and de-mystify CPAPs. And I present to you, Behind the Mask.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.160]  I cranked mine up to full power!
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:01.920]  What did you say?
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.020]  How's it going, Gavin?
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.720]  Oh, are you at full base?
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:09.000]  How many...
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.260]  What number is yours at?
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.500]  25!
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.080]  God, how's it even staying on...
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.420]  Oh god, how's it even staying on your head?
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:28.840]  I'm having to secure it with my hand and when my mouth is closed it fills with air!
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:37.600]  Let's never do this again! This is a terrible idea!
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.880]  Behind the Mask has a pretty short runway. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.900]  Talking with it kind of makes me want to throw up.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:46.900]  Really?
[01:08:49.980 --> 01:08:52.700]  You can like hiss with it, that's cool, you can go like...
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.860]  That didn't come through at all, fuck.
[01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:04.790]  I would love to hear you guys review a movie together.
[01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:05.550]  Yeah.
[01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:14.930]  Dude, it carried away! We're watching all the Jim Carrey movies!
[01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:22.190]  Okay, we need to stop this, this is bad.
[01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.450]  Yeah, Geoff, you want to button this one up for us?
[01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:33.470]  I'd like to end it here, take it out, but I think it'd be better if Andrew did.
[01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:34.190]  Oh, okay.
[01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.050]  Andrew, send us off.
[01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:41.410]  Thanks for listening to the Regulation Podcast!
[01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:45.350]  Be sure to check out Patreon!
[01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:48.610]  Have a great day!
[01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:52.550]  Normalize CPAPs!
