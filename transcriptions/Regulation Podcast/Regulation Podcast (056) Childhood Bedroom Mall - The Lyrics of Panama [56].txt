[00:00.000 --> 00:03.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.500 --> 00:08.100]  This is number 56. My name is Geoff. With me, as always, Andrew, Gavin, Nick and Eric.
[00:09.200 --> 00:12.200]  Gavin really knows what he's talking about when it comes to piss.
[00:12.280 --> 00:13.880]  And everybody's everybody knows it.
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.100]  Really? I was just saying I wish my bladder was a bit bigger.
[00:16.580 --> 00:20.380]  What if there was a reverse pubi at like 85?
[00:20.960 --> 00:22.220]  Like you became unpubic.
[00:22.580 --> 00:24.820]  Like a Benjamin Button situation almost?
[00:25.180 --> 00:27.480]  Yeah, but you don't like shrink down to a child.
[00:27.480 --> 00:30.360]  You're just you're just no longer puberty.
[00:30.600 --> 00:31.920]  Your voice becomes higher.
[00:32.640 --> 00:35.000]  Yeah. You have a higher pitch voice. I like it.
[00:35.740 --> 00:37.580]  I don't see any issue with the reverse puberty.
[00:38.120 --> 00:39.180]  Are there any other changes?
[00:39.300 --> 00:41.060]  You just get a high pitch voice?
[00:41.800 --> 00:42.520]  Less hairy.
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.440]  Well, that happens as you get older, too, typically.
[00:45.620 --> 00:47.540]  Probably a smaller set of genitals.
[00:47.860 --> 00:51.660]  Yeah, like as you get older, the balls consistently go further, right?
[00:51.740 --> 00:53.140]  Maybe they start coming back up.
[00:53.360 --> 00:56.380]  Maybe they reverse it, like you hit maximum droppage.
[00:56.380 --> 01:00.840]  And then they swing up like the balls hit the bottom of the yo-yo.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.660]  And then they swing. Yeah, yeah, bounce back.
[01:04.260 --> 01:06.980]  Yeah, they start working at the same speed, but in reverse.
[01:07.060 --> 01:08.060]  What do you like? Fifty five.
[01:10.060 --> 01:10.460]  It's
[01:12.240 --> 01:14.580]  this is a terrible visual, but you know how like
[01:15.340 --> 01:18.700]  your kids will measure on like a door frame as they get bigger.
[01:18.700 --> 01:20.080]  It's like a reverse ball thing.
[01:20.120 --> 01:21.760]  The ball length going up, going down.
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.900]  So happy you said doorframe.
[01:24.540 --> 01:25.880]  Well, how else do they measure?
[01:26.560 --> 01:28.080]  I don't know, nothing. Wall?
[01:29.320 --> 01:31.660]  Do you have your childhood walls so you can look at your high on?
[01:31.980 --> 01:33.760]  No. No, me neither.
[01:34.360 --> 01:36.400]  My childhood walls are about to get turned into a mall.
[01:37.840 --> 01:38.480]  Childhood walls.
[01:39.300 --> 01:40.720]  What store do you think it's going to be?
[01:41.360 --> 01:43.940]  Oh, man, I didn't even think about that.
[01:44.140 --> 01:45.460]  That's the first thing I thought of.
[01:45.520 --> 01:48.460]  You didn't even think about like Canadian Foot Locker is going to be like
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.240]  where your bedroom was.
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.280]  Do you think you'd be able to pinpoint it?
[01:51.600 --> 01:52.620]  Oh, definitely I could.
[01:52.620 --> 01:54.320]  Yeah, without a doubt.
[01:54.760 --> 01:56.380]  Is it perfectly in line with the other four?
[01:56.960 --> 01:59.580]  Uh. Oh, man.
[02:00.080 --> 02:01.400]  Yeah. Is this mall in the line?
[02:01.920 --> 02:04.000]  No. Yeah, yeah, it would be.
[02:04.020 --> 02:04.340]  It would be.
[02:04.480 --> 02:06.960]  It's an extension of an already existing fake mall.
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.860]  We have so many fake malls and it's a fake mall.
[02:10.500 --> 02:11.120]  What does that mean?
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.600]  Does that mean?
[02:12.920 --> 02:17.480]  So it's not like they call it a mall, but it's all like exterior stores
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.000]  or like they're in a line, but none of them connect.
[02:21.740 --> 02:23.660]  Mm. I see what you're saying.
[02:23.740 --> 02:24.880]  It's like an outdoor mall.
[02:25.200 --> 02:26.880]  Yeah. Like, you know, like a strip mall.
[02:27.200 --> 02:28.040]  Sort of. Yeah.
[02:28.080 --> 02:29.160]  But like larger.
[02:29.380 --> 02:31.060]  Yeah. Like South Park Meadows.
[02:32.060 --> 02:33.740]  It's. Oh, got it.
[02:34.000 --> 02:34.600]  It's a weird thing.
[02:34.620 --> 02:39.580]  So my my childhood home is on a street that the mall has slowly been taking over
[02:39.580 --> 02:42.580]  for many years as an extension.
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.500]  And people have held on in protest because they just want to destroy the street
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.080]  and then extend it to be part of the mall.
[02:50.080 --> 02:53.180]  But there's only one house left and that house
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.660]  it's holding on for now.
[02:55.740 --> 02:58.340]  But I think it may it may be selling soon.
[02:58.780 --> 03:02.740]  So ideally, if you could choose,
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.140]  what store would be like?
[03:06.500 --> 03:09.480]  I think there would be a beautiful irony if there was a Lids
[03:10.940 --> 03:12.680]  over my childhood home.
[03:13.520 --> 03:16.540]  Just a store of merchandise I could never use.
[03:17.820 --> 03:19.360]  That would be so funny.
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.060]  I feel like you deserve to have your old home turned into like a bathtub store.
[03:24.580 --> 03:28.240]  Oh, OK. So we like a lush type thing or like a bath bomb.
[03:28.760 --> 03:30.860]  Oh, you went with the bath bomb.
[03:31.460 --> 03:33.520]  I'd be wild if Lush actually sold a bathtub.
[03:34.060 --> 03:36.260]  Dude, a Lush bathtub that slowly disintegrates.
[03:36.600 --> 03:38.180]  Yeah, it just slowly melts.
[03:39.180 --> 03:40.700]  Oh, we should we should make a bath bomb tub.
[03:41.560 --> 03:45.000]  Is Lush the ultimate Mother's Day company?
[03:45.660 --> 03:47.380]  You're like, oh, fuck, I got to get it for my mom.
[03:47.900 --> 03:48.660]  Bath bomb, perfect.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.080]  I appreciate that they decided to associate bomb with a pleasure.
[03:54.560 --> 03:55.580]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:56.240 --> 03:57.540]  And what other good bombs are there?
[03:57.980 --> 04:01.340]  Spice bomb. When we go to go eat, dip, dip, dip.
[04:01.440 --> 04:03.000]  Money bomb. Is that a thing?
[04:03.820 --> 04:05.240]  I think it's a Brad Pitt movie.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.760]  Yeah, you were going to you were going to hit me with a money bomb.
[04:08.300 --> 04:11.620]  This weekend, you said you were going to shower me with explosive money.
[04:12.080 --> 04:15.680]  And I was like, OK, Gavin, you said you had a realization this morning.
[04:15.680 --> 04:17.380]  And I want to I want to know what that was.
[04:17.440 --> 04:18.940]  I've been thinking about it for hours.
[04:19.140 --> 04:21.260]  I discovered the source of my strikes.
[04:22.520 --> 04:23.980]  You have a source of strikes.
[04:24.100 --> 04:26.660]  That's also not what I was assuming your realization was.
[04:27.220 --> 04:29.860]  Yeah. Nick sends me the link, right? Right.
[04:30.600 --> 04:32.840]  Opens the browser, that Google Drive folder.
[04:32.960 --> 04:36.320]  I then go to my audio folder, drag it.
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.640]  I let go and it does nothing the first time.
[04:40.020 --> 04:42.100]  And then if I do it again, it starts uploading.
[04:42.900 --> 04:44.080]  So it's a click and drag.
[04:44.700 --> 04:46.080]  Classic click and drag problem.
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.280]  Do you want to the drag?
[04:47.560 --> 04:49.080]  I do the drag. Absolutely.
[04:49.320 --> 04:50.820]  I'm a big clicker and a big dragger.
[04:51.040 --> 04:53.100]  That's good. Do a lot of drag in myself.
[04:53.340 --> 04:54.620]  Yeah, me too. I click and drag in there.
[04:54.760 --> 04:57.520]  So now that you know that that's the issue since your revelation,
[04:57.640 --> 04:58.860]  it shouldn't be happening anymore, right?
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.100]  In theory. And the audience will be pleased to know I picked up
[05:03.100 --> 05:05.560]  picked me up a couple of strikes at the weekend.
[05:06.000 --> 05:06.760]  Sure did. Yeah.
[05:07.420 --> 05:09.900]  We started a slack channel for Gavin Strikes.
[05:10.060 --> 05:11.480]  There's no way I'd remember otherwise.
[05:11.940 --> 05:13.200]  Like I need a place to put these.
[05:13.800 --> 05:16.860]  I'm pretty damn close to overtaking my hot dog count with strikes.
[05:17.480 --> 05:18.460]  That five strikes.
[05:18.820 --> 05:20.320]  How many did you pick up this weekend?
[05:20.780 --> 05:22.560]  Two. I got I got double whammy.
[05:22.660 --> 05:25.280]  I got two. Oh, it was an audio and a video.
[05:25.740 --> 05:28.540]  It's so funny that this is about strikes because I thought it was going to be
[05:28.540 --> 05:31.420]  about like you realizing a communication thing
[05:31.420 --> 05:36.800]  because you annoyed Geoff accidentally and extremely.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.280]  Oh, I was getting.
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.880]  What you talk about this morning?
[05:41.700 --> 05:44.060]  Yes, I guess it was part of that video.
[05:44.200 --> 05:44.800]  You're like, you know what?
[05:44.820 --> 05:47.440]  I had a realization about this, so I thought it was about
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.540]  is going to be some deeper insight about the miscommunication.
[05:51.600 --> 05:52.720]  Let me be honest with you.
[05:52.980 --> 05:53.900]  I was sat there.
[05:54.000 --> 05:56.160]  Everyone's calling me pedantic and saying I'm a bastard.
[05:56.500 --> 05:58.100]  I still have no idea what happened.
[05:58.580 --> 06:01.020]  Why don't you go back to the realization drawing board
[06:01.020 --> 06:01.960]  and try for a little longer?
[06:02.920 --> 06:03.620]  You'll get there.
[06:05.580 --> 06:07.020]  Well, now we've got to explain it.
[06:07.680 --> 06:08.400]  No, I can explain.
[06:08.580 --> 06:10.100]  No, we don't. We don't have to explain it.
[06:10.880 --> 06:12.280]  I think it's funnier this way.
[06:12.600 --> 06:15.900]  No, it isn't, because I still don't really know what you're annoyed at.
[06:18.080 --> 06:21.200]  The problem with you, Gavin, is that you have a steward
[06:21.200 --> 06:24.620]  and like a whatever in you, you know, or like you're
[06:24.620 --> 06:26.800]  you have a little mischief maker in you.
[06:26.980 --> 06:30.140]  And there are times when you're not meaning to create mischief,
[06:30.260 --> 06:33.100]  but it feels so obvious that like there's no other option.
[06:33.400 --> 06:36.060]  And you're just genuinely asking a question.
[06:36.400 --> 06:40.720]  I was trying to help and I was confused and I need like some sort of signal
[06:40.720 --> 06:43.440]  like a noise or sound effect that is like a non-rabbit.
[06:43.840 --> 06:44.860]  Yes, you need.
[06:45.480 --> 06:46.980]  Identifier, like a preface to a sentence.
[06:46.980 --> 06:50.680]  You need like the reverse of a dog whistle, like it's to indicate a genuine
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.460]  it's not it's like a human, a human whistle, like a truth whistle, a truth tone.
[06:55.940 --> 06:56.620]  So here's what happened.
[06:56.760 --> 06:57.380]  Here's what happened, right?
[06:57.800 --> 06:59.940]  We're playing, we're playing Doom, Geoff's playing.
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.780]  Geoff's got the game, we're all watching.
[07:02.020 --> 07:03.920]  Geoff says, can someone record the backup?
[07:04.380 --> 07:04.960]  I go to.
[07:05.040 --> 07:06.000]  That's not what Geoff said.
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.960]  OK, you said your shit, your shit might be broken.
[07:09.160 --> 07:10.460]  Geoff said, I'm a little worried.
[07:10.460 --> 07:12.680]  I'm a little worried about my video capture.
[07:12.920 --> 07:15.340]  Could somebody record a backup video for me?
[07:15.400 --> 07:19.200]  So immediately I'm a I got OBS open and then I realized,
[07:19.380 --> 07:22.640]  oh, I record the backup quite a lot, especially for streams,
[07:22.640 --> 07:25.360]  which is usually like a same screen sort of situation.
[07:25.440 --> 07:28.200]  I immediately realized I'm not in the game with Geoff.
[07:28.320 --> 07:30.020]  There's no my perspective to record.
[07:30.260 --> 07:32.200]  So then I asked, I was just like, oh.
[07:33.360 --> 07:35.720]  Do you mean like record the the Discord?
[07:35.920 --> 07:38.600]  Because we're watching a stream on Discord and you said no.
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.360]  Uh, like I was an idiot and then I was just sat back thinking,
[07:42.980 --> 07:45.060]  I don't know what does he mean that what my record?
[07:45.580 --> 07:46.480]  And I'm just trying to help.
[07:46.560 --> 07:48.000]  I'm just trying to help you record the backup.
[07:48.300 --> 07:49.080]  I don't know what you mean.
[07:49.180 --> 07:52.360]  And then I asked again and you said yes.
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.620]  So I was very confused.
[07:53.680 --> 07:54.660]  I thought, what do you want from me?
[07:54.660 --> 07:56.680]  And then I'm being told I'm pedantic.
[07:56.900 --> 08:01.080]  If I'd sat there wedging both thumbs into my anus doing nothing,
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.800]  I would've got in less trouble than if I was sat up trying to figure out what you meant.
[08:05.540 --> 08:09.120]  You asked, I know it was rhetorical, but you asked a second ago,
[08:09.220 --> 08:10.160]  what do you want from me?
[08:10.560 --> 08:12.760]  Yeah, I want this is what I wanted.
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.700]  Oh, oh, wait.
[08:14.760 --> 08:16.240]  So you're just messing with me the whole time?
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.860]  No. Hey, welcome to the podcast. OK.
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.680]  Welcome to the regulation podcast.
[08:21.920 --> 08:28.700]  Maybe you look around, you know, rummage through the drawers, reads, learn all.
[08:28.820 --> 08:30.720]  It's you're going to have a lot of fun here. It's great.
[08:30.960 --> 08:34.180]  It's just it's sometimes you have a beautiful thing, Gavin, where.
[08:34.180 --> 08:38.920]  Yeah, you're actually trying so hard to be helpful that it feels like you're fucking with us.
[08:38.980 --> 08:40.600]  It does. Well, and that's what it was.
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.720]  That was weird about it, because I was I was really trying to like fight through
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.500]  getting yelled at to still try and help.
[08:45.700 --> 08:46.900]  Yeah, you're trying to be good.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.180]  And then you poured on and then Geoff was like, thank you, Andrew.
[08:50.180 --> 08:52.000]  And I was like, what? And then Eric was shitting on me.
[08:52.020 --> 08:54.640]  And then even Nick said I was being a pedantic bastard.
[08:54.860 --> 08:57.380]  And I just thought, I don't know what's happening.
[08:58.640 --> 09:00.060]  Everyone was messing with me then.
[09:01.420 --> 09:03.340]  Yeah. Yeah. I was having fun.
[09:03.340 --> 09:04.600]  I was having fun with my friends.
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.320]  I was having fun with my friends.
[09:07.300 --> 09:08.920]  Yeah. I don't even know where to go with it.
[09:10.960 --> 09:12.720]  You just you just keep being you.
[09:12.800 --> 09:13.180]  It's awesome.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  It is awesome.
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.880]  No, I don't want to help you out.
[09:23.080 --> 09:24.040]  You want some help?
[09:24.460 --> 09:25.300]  What when you shower?
[09:26.140 --> 09:29.060]  Oh, when you have a shower, do you face the shower?
[09:29.160 --> 09:29.960]  Do you face the wall?
[09:30.860 --> 09:35.420]  I face the shower to wash my face and my hair,
[09:35.900 --> 09:37.900]  and then I turn around for the rest of the shower.
[09:38.360 --> 09:41.560]  OK, I don't like I don't like water on my face that much.
[09:41.580 --> 09:42.360]  So I get it out of the way.
[09:43.020 --> 09:45.260]  Yeah. Oh, do you see me?
[09:45.360 --> 09:48.420]  Sorry. Yeah, I got really hot while I was yelling.
[09:48.560 --> 09:48.980]  And now I'm just.
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.880]  I would say 90 percent of the shower is hitting me in the back
[09:55.880 --> 09:58.740]  and I'm turning around for, you know, select moments.
[09:59.420 --> 10:00.280]  Interesting when it.
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.180]  But mainly it's going down my back and my crack, and then I'm like spinning a few times.
[10:05.200 --> 10:11.040]  I was talking to someone and I had never considered having the shower
[10:11.040 --> 10:15.040]  be predominantly on my back or to wash my hair with my back facing it
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.120]  as opposed to the front.
[10:16.300 --> 10:19.260]  And they had equally never considered just facing it
[10:19.260 --> 10:22.360]  and having like tilting your head down for it.
[10:22.480 --> 10:24.780]  So I was curious as I was interested to see
[10:25.280 --> 10:27.820]  if there was like most people do it one way or the other.
[10:28.360 --> 10:29.440]  Seems pretty split.
[10:29.560 --> 10:31.840]  Wait, so you face it the whole time.
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.760]  I feel like when I'm facing the shower, I'm borderline waterboarding myself.
[10:36.960 --> 10:40.260]  Yeah, I do like head down.
[10:40.660 --> 10:41.800]  It's the top of the head.
[10:42.180 --> 10:43.740]  Maybe it's a head size thing.
[10:43.780 --> 10:46.340]  So it's all like flowing around your face.
[10:46.440 --> 10:49.420]  See, I feel I feel like I'm really working the hands.
[10:49.600 --> 10:51.480]  The hands are working the front real well.
[10:51.500 --> 10:52.560]  Like I'm getting suds.
[10:52.680 --> 10:54.200]  They go, it's I'm blasting the front.
[10:54.500 --> 10:57.160]  And if the water is mainly dealing with the back
[10:57.160 --> 11:00.220]  because I'm not scrubbing, you know, the middle of my spine very well.
[11:00.600 --> 11:01.760]  No, I feel like it evens out.
[11:02.160 --> 11:03.920]  Yeah, like I'll do some spins and stuff.
[11:03.960 --> 11:08.220]  I'll make sure to get all the angles, but I'm predominantly facing that shower.
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.100]  You'll do some spins?
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.640]  Yeah, you got to get full body coverage and tilt around, spin,
[11:15.820 --> 11:18.400]  move around, you know, you had a shower.
[11:18.880 --> 11:20.340]  Phil described it kind of like a ballerina.
[11:20.440 --> 11:21.800]  I thought that you had to do some spins.
[11:22.380 --> 11:24.220]  Eric, we we don't know how you shower.
[11:24.540 --> 11:25.120]  Oh, I'm like Gavin.
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.420]  I face away most of the time and then to wash like face
[11:30.440 --> 11:31.200]  face in the front.
[11:31.380 --> 11:33.980]  Yeah, like but most of the time it just too much,
[11:34.080 --> 11:36.980]  too much at play when you're facing the shower.
[11:37.340 --> 11:40.760]  You do like your dick and under like your pits and your face
[11:40.760 --> 11:42.660]  and then everything else is from the back.
[11:42.940 --> 11:44.040]  Yeah. You know what?
[11:44.060 --> 11:46.520]  We should try doing opposite shower next shower.
[11:47.080 --> 11:49.340]  Oh, I know you're going to say we should all try taking a shower together.
[11:49.440 --> 11:50.760]  But yeah, I like you. I like that idea.
[11:52.020 --> 11:52.680]  Me too.
[11:55.280 --> 11:56.900]  But you don't hit the shower that much, right?
[11:56.940 --> 11:58.540]  You're mainly tub guy still.
[11:58.660 --> 12:01.860]  Well, no, no. Like if I'm the tub is a pleasure option.
[12:02.160 --> 12:03.860]  It's not if I'm getting clean, I'm going to use it.
[12:03.940 --> 12:06.360]  Sure. I'll keep the shower in the rotation.
[12:07.720 --> 12:14.180]  So let's say how many days a week would you say you bathe versus shower?
[12:14.900 --> 12:15.660]  Like what's the ratio?
[12:16.480 --> 12:19.680]  I'd say probably ideal rotation.
[12:19.940 --> 12:22.000]  You're you're doing like shower every like two days
[12:22.520 --> 12:24.300]  and then like a bath in between.
[12:24.940 --> 12:26.620]  OK. I mean, that's a lot.
[12:26.880 --> 12:27.780]  It feels like a lot of water.
[12:27.980 --> 12:31.860]  But if we're in an ideal rotation, maximum for me, comfort
[12:31.860 --> 12:35.620]  mix of cleanliness and comfort, you're going like
[12:36.220 --> 12:40.540]  probably once every two days at most three and then bath in between.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.940]  Nick, what was the last time you took a bath?
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.160]  Last night to cool down.
[12:47.660 --> 12:49.580]  Really? Is that true?
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.580]  Yeah, I felt really bad last night.
[12:53.040 --> 12:54.520]  Wait, after the dogs?
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.440]  Yeah, full squint.
[12:56.760 --> 13:01.200]  But then you came back from I wasn't even going to get into this.
[13:01.380 --> 13:02.300]  This is a totally different thing.
[13:02.440 --> 13:06.660]  But you came back when we were we broke for lunch and then came back.
[13:06.820 --> 13:10.120]  And then you asked Gavin if he's like doing OK, because you're not.
[13:10.540 --> 13:12.600]  I haven't I hadn't eaten anything yet today.
[13:12.740 --> 13:15.340]  We recorded until like what, two or so.
[13:15.440 --> 13:16.840]  Yeah. Two thirty.
[13:17.320 --> 13:19.760]  And I was like, I'll just eat a little something because I'm hungry.
[13:19.760 --> 13:21.580]  But tummy's kind of feeling.
[13:22.200 --> 13:25.160]  And so I just had some oatmeal with like a little bit of peanut butter
[13:25.160 --> 13:27.820]  and it's just natural peanut butter with no salt or sugar.
[13:28.680 --> 13:30.580]  And I ate it and then I was just sitting there like.
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.440]  What? What?
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.240]  And you were really hot.
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.680]  I'm really hot right now.
[13:36.960 --> 13:37.340]  You...
[13:38.060 --> 13:41.360]  Wait, you were like Godzilla roaring.
[13:41.860 --> 13:43.860]  Yeah, dude. Last night it was Godzilla roaring.
[13:43.960 --> 13:48.560]  I woke up at like one thirty in the morning and was like, I just want to die.
[13:51.840 --> 13:54.660]  And the noises equate to what? Stomach pain?
[13:55.220 --> 13:59.680]  Yeah, stomach pain, a lot of stomach pain, but also just general hotness.
[13:59.760 --> 14:02.680]  I thought I might be having a heat stroke even though I was in my air-conditioned house.
[14:03.520 --> 14:05.920]  You just have a legit elevated temperature.
[14:06.400 --> 14:09.360]  I guess so. I had Pedialyte and stuff and I cooled down.
[14:09.660 --> 14:16.680]  I kind of wandered back and forth between the bathroom by my room and the main bathroom.
[14:16.820 --> 14:19.060]  I was just like, it's cooler in this one, now it's cooler in that one,
[14:19.060 --> 14:22.900]  now it's cooler in this one. Just trying to figure out if I had to go to the bathroom or not.
[14:23.100 --> 14:27.880]  It's like when you burn your finger and you can't get it to feel cold and you keep having to go to the cold tap.
[14:28.220 --> 14:31.780]  But also I had like heartburn at the same time. So it was like all right here.
[14:31.980 --> 14:38.880]  I feel like the poison shook off me last night, but I felt like Godzilla raw and I felt pukey.
[14:39.740 --> 14:45.340]  And I was debating whether I was going to have a papless sleep because I felt so pukey, but eventually it did go.
[14:45.460 --> 14:48.020]  I do feel like just uncomfortable and shitty and hot today.
[14:48.720 --> 14:50.560]  Puking in the pap would be so bad.
[14:50.820 --> 14:55.480]  I think I over-sodiumed myself or something because I just felt so salty.
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.180]  And I sat on the... I have a couch that's leather so I was like, oh it's cool, it's cool on my back.
[15:00.300 --> 15:03.160]  And then I heard Archie stir. He started crying in the night.
[15:03.500 --> 15:07.600]  And he was having a bad dream and I was like, fuck, I'm going to die and I'm going to die in his room.
[15:07.980 --> 15:13.980]  And I went and I laid down on the floor next to him and I was like, oh it's okay bud, don't worry about it.
[15:13.980 --> 15:16.500]  And I laid right down on a bunch of fucking Hot Wheels cars.
[15:16.600 --> 15:17.800]  Had a great night.
[15:17.840 --> 15:19.200]  What the hell?
[15:19.300 --> 15:21.060]  Feeling like shit. Hot as fuck.
[15:21.820 --> 15:22.420]  Tummy hurts.
[15:22.800 --> 15:23.280]  Sick.
[15:24.100 --> 15:24.340]  Wow.
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.240]  How are you doing today, Eric?
[15:26.380 --> 15:28.220]  I'm fine. I'm totally fine.
[15:28.220 --> 15:29.520]  I feel great too.
[15:29.620 --> 15:32.960]  I had like a couple of beers with like the dogs or whatever.
[15:33.160 --> 15:36.480]  So it was like I woke up feeling like a little like in my mouth.
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.820]  But I'm fine. Brush your teeth and you're good. I'm fine.
[15:40.820 --> 15:47.940]  Man, I feel like we really must have played some kind of hot dog Russian roulette because I walked away A-OK and you got oof.
[15:48.520 --> 15:52.640]  When you said beers with the dogs, I imagine you and a pack of dogs is drinking away.
[15:54.040 --> 15:56.800]  My association was not immediate hot dogs and beers.
[15:57.620 --> 15:59.840]  What kind of dog is the best dog to drink beer with?
[16:00.220 --> 16:05.540]  Oh, I feel like a bulldog is such a great drinking dog, but maybe I'm influenced by barks.
[16:05.540 --> 16:10.760]  I feel like St. Bernard's, but I guess you drink whiskey with them, maybe.
[16:11.260 --> 16:12.720]  But they seem like a good beer drinking dog too.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.700]  What kind of dog was a lassie dog?
[16:16.400 --> 16:16.960]  Border Collie?
[16:17.080 --> 16:18.160]  Border Collie, yeah.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.820]  I'd bev it up with one then.
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.780]  I think it's a Chihuahua.
[16:23.960 --> 16:31.420]  One of those like the ones where you go to your friend's house and it's like their mom's dog.
[16:32.140 --> 16:37.780]  And it's just sort of like not super like great looking, but it looks good enough.
[16:37.940 --> 16:40.760]  And it's you're just like this dog's old and kind of like fucked up.
[16:40.780 --> 16:41.700]  And that's pretty cool.
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.800]  Chihuahua is going to get you to a bar fight.
[16:44.640 --> 16:45.040]  What?
[16:45.180 --> 16:49.120]  You're going to drink too much and then you're going to instigate with somebody in the bar and you're going to end up in a fight.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.900]  Chihuahua is the kind of dog that lets its mouth write a check that its owner can't cash.
[16:55.200 --> 16:56.340]  This is my kind of drinking dog.
[16:58.020 --> 17:00.000]  That dog can't hold its booze.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.240]  Senior Chihuahua, I think, is my kind of drinking dog.
[17:05.020 --> 17:06.460]  It's got little rat claws.
[17:07.220 --> 17:12.200]  When you would have pain, did you ever visualize it internally as like a specific thing?
[17:13.140 --> 17:14.480]  Panic's talking about going Godzilla.
[17:16.620 --> 17:18.080]  Godzilla mode inside.
[17:18.620 --> 17:32.180]  When I was a kid and I would have pain, like internal pain in my head, I would always visualize that that area, there was like a door that that like guards were trying to break into.
[17:33.220 --> 17:39.580]  So like my stomach hurt, I had like a stomach door and the bad guys were trying to break through the stomach door.
[17:39.680 --> 17:40.700]  And that's what the pain was.
[17:41.480 --> 17:42.400]  Oh, interesting.
[17:43.340 --> 17:44.640]  I used to visualize it.
[17:45.260 --> 17:47.280]  I used to visualize like a heart.
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.620]  In each, like if I had an earache, it was like someone was squeezing my tiny ear heart.
[17:52.780 --> 17:55.000]  Oh, your little ear heart?
[17:55.540 --> 17:55.840]  Yeah.
[17:56.780 --> 17:58.420]  It's like gripping it and ripping it.
[17:59.440 --> 18:02.280]  So would you see a little ear heart in your mind?
[18:02.800 --> 18:05.560]  No, I would just visualize it being squeezed when my ear hurt.
[18:05.680 --> 18:07.460]  I used to get like ear infections as a kid.
[18:08.100 --> 18:09.900]  Andrew, is that picture kind of like what you picture?
[18:11.340 --> 18:14.340]  Uh, a little bit less cartoony.
[18:15.700 --> 18:20.040]  But yeah, more realistic, like more like realistic is what you're thinking.
[18:20.040 --> 18:22.480]  In my head, it was always like a medieval door for some reason.
[18:23.380 --> 18:24.980]  It was like an old castle.
[18:25.960 --> 18:26.540]  Hold the door.
[18:27.000 --> 18:27.900]  Hold the door.
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.760]  I was trying to find the image right now.
[18:32.240 --> 18:35.280]  Nick said that he has Link health hearts in mind.
[18:37.020 --> 18:41.160]  I recently haven't watched Game of Thrones in such a long time.
[18:41.220 --> 18:43.620]  And I recently watched a clip of it.
[18:43.740 --> 18:48.300]  And it occurred to me that I didn't have this thought at all while watching it.
[18:48.600 --> 18:52.380]  That White Walkers just look like they were all AI generated.
[18:52.980 --> 18:54.980]  Like they have a style to them.
[18:55.260 --> 18:58.680]  That like all of it looks like shit now in a way that it didn't.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.720]  Like every time I see, I'll post a photo as an example.
[19:02.320 --> 19:03.440]  This just looks like AI.
[19:03.440 --> 19:05.340]  This looks like an AI made thing.
[19:05.440 --> 19:07.900]  Oh, yeah, I thought it looked like shit back then.
[19:08.080 --> 19:09.120]  Like it looked terrible.
[19:09.720 --> 19:13.780]  Maybe AI is just a real big fan of Game of Thrones and it lifted its style.
[19:13.980 --> 19:16.860]  It could be. They've sourced it all from Game of Thrones.
[19:17.140 --> 19:18.380]  Like this looks bad.
[19:18.700 --> 19:20.220]  I don't know another way to put it.
[19:20.300 --> 19:25.680]  Like Game of Thrones in like that last season or like the last two where it was doing that stuff was like this looks terrible.
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.760]  While watching it, I didn't notice it.
[19:27.900 --> 19:29.320]  But now when I see it, it's just...
[19:29.320 --> 19:30.200]  They look like the same.
[19:30.720 --> 19:32.060]  It looks very AI to me.
[19:32.700 --> 19:38.280]  What a terrifying seven year enemy that turned out to be no big fucking deal.
[19:38.960 --> 19:41.580]  Yeah, it's a very wet dick of an ending for that character.
[19:42.000 --> 19:42.680]  God damn.
[19:43.500 --> 19:47.300]  I think now looking back, hold the door is the best moment of the entire show.
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.440]  Oh, interesting.
[19:49.040 --> 19:49.340]  Yeah.
[19:49.980 --> 19:51.320]  It's just quite a payoff.
[19:51.860 --> 19:52.520]  It is.
[19:53.180 --> 19:56.660]  But I guess it's like a mystery that I never cared about, but it is a good payoff.
[19:57.180 --> 19:58.280]  Yeah, I think that's why I liked it though.
[19:58.320 --> 20:01.060]  It caught me off guard and I was like, oh, if you think about the logistics of that,
[20:01.060 --> 20:03.300]  he like time sniped that guy.
[20:04.000 --> 20:04.340]  Yeah.
[20:04.560 --> 20:05.060]  So sad.
[20:06.500 --> 20:07.700]  Yeah, he did.
[20:08.840 --> 20:09.960]  It's so sad.
[20:10.340 --> 20:11.600]  Yeah, it's tragic.
[20:12.120 --> 20:15.360]  I like that we're playing future baseball and people can get time sniped.
[20:15.640 --> 20:15.940]  Yeah.
[20:16.260 --> 20:17.640]  Let's not time snipe any strikes.
[20:18.700 --> 20:21.440]  I haven't been really invested in a show in a long time.
[20:21.740 --> 20:25.520]  I'd love to have like a seven season show that I care about.
[20:25.900 --> 20:26.240]  Hmm.
[20:26.660 --> 20:28.900]  I just keep hearing people talk about and or.
[20:29.420 --> 20:31.140]  Oh, I couldn't care less.
[20:31.600 --> 20:34.260]  Maybe it'll be the 2018 version of Charmed.
[20:34.720 --> 20:35.260]  Oh, God.
[20:35.300 --> 20:36.220]  We have to watch Charmed.
[20:37.240 --> 20:38.240]  Yeah, we have to do that.
[20:38.340 --> 20:39.200]  We have to watch six episodes.
[20:40.080 --> 20:45.040]  Have you ever seen five people lose that much enthusiasm for a good idea that quickly?
[20:48.860 --> 20:50.880]  I still have enthusiasm for it.
[20:50.940 --> 20:52.720]  Just Geoff went away right after we did it.
[20:52.780 --> 20:54.820]  So just like it went in the back burner.
[20:55.300 --> 20:56.100]  I'm ready to get to it.
[20:56.200 --> 20:57.520]  We need to put it on the calendar.
[20:57.520 --> 20:58.320]  We do.
[20:59.020 --> 21:00.420]  I don't even know what Charmed is about.
[21:01.140 --> 21:01.560]  They're witches.
[21:01.900 --> 21:04.120]  Witch sisters that do witch things.

[22:34.240 --> 22:34.620]  5.
[22:35.420 --> 22:35.940]  75.
[22:36.940 --> 22:38.520]  Uh, well, hold on. Let me try it.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.740]  Alright, it's not going to be 5. 75.
[22:41.340 --> 22:42.400]  Why wouldn't it be 5?
[22:43.000 --> 22:43.620]  Yeah, why not?
[22:43.980 --> 22:46.060]  I don't want to ask a question about the index.
[22:47.740 --> 22:48.220]  Uh...
[22:51.500 --> 22:55.060]  How many... how many fla... how many...
[22:55.800 --> 22:57.680]  I should have gone with the index page.
[22:57.940 --> 22:59.180]  I'm trying to figure out how to ask this.
[22:59.500 --> 23:00.660]  Just go with the index. I don't know, man.
[23:01.340 --> 23:07.380]  How many ships are registered... have a flag registration in Panama as of 2022?
[23:08.200 --> 23:08.680]  What?
[23:09.500 --> 23:12.780]  How many ships... how many ships... seafaring ships are registered in Panama?
[23:12.780 --> 23:18.970]  Now, I want to be very clear. You know the answer to this question, right? We're not... we're not going to all speculate on...
[23:19.460 --> 23:20.140]  I'm looking at it.
[23:20.400 --> 23:20.700]  Okay.
[23:20.760 --> 23:22.500]  I'm looking at... I'm doing my little almanac.
[23:22.780 --> 23:23.400]  9,200.
[23:24.300 --> 23:26.600]  Okay. Eric says 9,200.
[23:27.040 --> 23:28.200]  How many ships...
[23:28.200 --> 23:29.600]  Were registered in Panama.
[23:29.960 --> 23:30.120]  Okay.
[23:30.120 --> 23:34.240]  You know, you register your ship in different countries based on, like, what laws you're trying to skirt.
[23:34.680 --> 23:35.100]  Oh, huh.
[23:36.520 --> 23:39.060]  A lot of... a lot of ships are registered in the Bahamas, for instance.
[23:39.420 --> 23:40.860]  Really? I didn't know that.
[23:41.440 --> 23:41.600]  Yeah.
[23:42.120 --> 23:43.020]  That's wild.
[23:43.220 --> 23:44.960]  The city or the country?
[23:45.500 --> 23:47.620]  Panama feels like a 70s rock band.
[23:47.700 --> 23:49.480]  Not Panama City, Panama Country.
[23:49.820 --> 23:50.060]  Okay.
[23:50.060 --> 23:51.540]  With the canal, the big canal.
[23:52.000 --> 23:53.580]  Panama is a Van Halen song.
[23:54.060 --> 23:55.660]  Yeah, that's a Van Halen song, Andrew.
[23:56.340 --> 23:58.960]  Panama, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[23:59.180 --> 24:01.740]  And it's a... what is it, a man-o-planet canal, Panama?
[24:02.500 --> 24:03.860]  I would guess...
[24:03.860 --> 24:05.300]  It's the same forward as backwards?
[24:05.700 --> 24:06.260]  4,500.
[24:06.500 --> 24:06.740]  Oh!
[24:07.120 --> 24:10.700]  4,500. Eric said 9,200. And Nick and Ga... the other one.
[24:10.700 --> 24:11.440]  Andrew.
[24:11.800 --> 24:12.520]  6,000.
[24:12.960 --> 24:13.440]  Okay.
[24:14.360 --> 24:15.700]  I'll do 7,000.
[24:16.440 --> 24:18.600]  8,025.
[24:19.120 --> 24:19.300]  Oh.
[24:19.580 --> 24:20.140]  Whoa!
[24:20.420 --> 24:22.120]  So I guess Nick gets it.
[24:22.120 --> 24:24.920]  Yeah, Nick wins by 50 ships.
[24:24.920 --> 24:25.580]  We were pretty close.
[24:26.120 --> 24:27.000]  Yeah, you guys weren't bad.
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.700]  For a bonus round, what percent of the total number of ships in the world is that?
[24:33.320 --> 24:34.100]  One sec.
[24:34.240 --> 24:35.520]  Wait, time out.
[24:36.060 --> 24:39.000]  There is actually a song called Panama by Van Halen?
[24:39.080 --> 24:40.040]  That's what they've been saying?
[24:40.040 --> 24:41.340]  You were just singing it.
[24:41.560 --> 24:44.200]  I didn't... I was doing a joke. I didn't know that that's what they actually said.
[24:44.200 --> 24:45.860]  No, you were singing the song Panama.
[24:46.080 --> 24:47.240]  I thought they said like...
[24:47.240 --> 24:47.800]  You parodied the lyrics?
[24:47.820 --> 24:51.860]  Animal, ba-da-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da. Animal.
[24:52.140 --> 24:56.280]  That's... that's Panama. You've heard the song Panama. You're singing Panama.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.540]  It's the name of the song.
[24:57.700 --> 25:00.140]  I didn't... I just googled it. That's crazy.
[25:00.680 --> 25:02.960]  That's the tune of Panama. You sang Panama.
[25:03.380 --> 25:05.360]  Yeah, I didn't know I was saying Panama.
[25:05.360 --> 25:11.060]  I was trying to make a joke that it sounded like the song, but it was... okay.
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.040]  Is that the first time someone learned the lyrics through their own brain?
[25:16.920 --> 25:19.280]  That was completely an internal discovery.
[25:20.020 --> 25:24.600]  Yeah, I really... I didn't know. I thought it was like...
[25:26.420 --> 25:27.420]  Sorry, boats?
[25:28.360 --> 25:31.360]  I don't even know now. Nick, you won a vinyl. Congratulations.
[25:31.680 --> 25:32.580]  Nick won a vinyl!
[25:33.120 --> 25:34.460]  Wow, we're back in our vinyl?
[25:34.460 --> 25:35.720]  Do we want to do that again?
[25:36.240 --> 25:36.640]  Why not?
[25:36.980 --> 25:43.460]  Can we keep this vinyl? Can we get a stereo and a record player and some speakers at the studio so we can listen to these vinyls together?
[25:43.880 --> 25:45.360]  I would hope so. Yeah, absolutely.
[25:46.060 --> 25:48.800]  Oh, I'm going to ask the robot to do some DJing.
[25:49.360 --> 25:49.720]  Wow!
[25:49.880 --> 25:51.680]  You can, like, skid your tires on the record.
[25:51.960 --> 25:52.940]  Yeah, I'm a robot.
[25:53.540 --> 25:54.740]  That's a great idea.
[25:55.720 --> 26:00.720]  Let's pick a terrible record that nobody cares about so it doesn't matter that I'm damaging it. Bye.
[26:01.120 --> 26:01.460]  Yep, yep.
[26:01.520 --> 26:02.660]  I got a bunch for you. Don't worry.
[26:03.580 --> 26:05.980]  That was a fun game, Geoff. Boats.
[26:07.060 --> 26:07.480]  Boats.
[26:07.820 --> 26:08.140]  Boats.
[26:08.700 --> 26:14.100]  Do you ever... when was the last time you had, like, a childhood show that you forgot about, like, popped back up?
[26:14.520 --> 26:17.380]  I just remembered Theodore the Tugboat.
[26:19.380 --> 26:22.080]  Thinking of boats, and it brought back so many memories.
[26:23.320 --> 26:27.220]  There was a boat show I used to watch when I was four. It was, like, Knockoff Thomas the Tank Engine.
[26:27.620 --> 26:30.380]  It is exactly like Thomas the Tank Engine, but a boat.
[26:30.380 --> 26:33.040]  Boat has a great theme song, is what I learned.
[26:33.740 --> 26:34.380]  It was, uh...
[26:35.620 --> 26:35.840]  Yeah.
[26:38.380 --> 26:40.060]  Tugboat! Oh, oh, oh.
[26:41.400 --> 26:53.480]  You know, it happened to me recently. I was, I don't know, looking at TikTok or something, and I saw a trailer or a little clip from a show called Today's Special that I used to watch all the time when I was a kid, and I had no memory of it until I saw the image.
[26:54.080 --> 26:54.880]  Today's Special?
[26:55.500 --> 26:57.240]  It's a Canadian show, actually. I didn't know that.
[26:57.240 --> 26:57.480]  Really?
[26:57.480 --> 27:04.800]  Ran from 81 to 87, and I just really loved the puppet who has the hat on, like the little old man puppet.
[27:05.820 --> 27:07.380]  Oh, yeah, over the shoulder.
[27:07.980 --> 27:10.400]  That's a great puppet. That guy's got character.
[27:11.080 --> 27:11.600]  Yeah, he does.
[27:12.340 --> 27:15.180]  That dog looks like he drinks with that man in a bar.
[27:15.320 --> 27:18.580]  That's the most, you just sent the most British-looking thing.
[27:18.780 --> 27:19.800]  Yeah, mine was Button Moon.
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.500]  Button Moon? The fuck is that?
[27:22.780 --> 27:23.920]  Button Moon and Mr. Spoon?
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.240]  Oh, phenomenal.
[27:25.440 --> 27:27.240]  Button Moon and Mr. Spoon?
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.740]  Yeah, they're all like little kitchen utensil people with bottles and shit, and the rocket was a baked beans tin.
[27:34.480 --> 27:42.380]  Any time you share childhood entertainment that you enjoyed, it explains so much about you. You're such a Button Moon guy.
[27:42.920 --> 27:45.780]  I was a huge Button Moon guy. Maybe you'd like the theme tune.
[27:46.400 --> 27:47.840]  Oh, sure. Love it.
[27:49.660 --> 27:53.320]  Tattooed teenage alien fighters from Beverly Hills?
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.140]  It was a knockoff, shitty, like USA Power Rangers show.
[27:59.400 --> 28:06.420]  And I'd watch it and I'd just go like, I kind of get what's happening here. Like, I get what this is trying to be or trying to do.
[28:06.540 --> 28:09.600]  But I'm like, I guess I'll watch it. Like, I'm invested. And man, it is.
[28:09.820 --> 28:12.780]  It looks like dollar store Mortal Kombat.
[28:13.280 --> 28:15.640]  Big time. It's bad. It's really bad.
[28:15.640 --> 28:20.120]  The dude in the bottom right in the black pleather shorts, that is quite an outfit.
[28:20.260 --> 28:22.620]  And he's like jabbing you with a pugil stick.
[28:22.620 --> 28:25.860]  And it looks like everybody huffed silver paint.
[28:27.280 --> 28:31.860]  Dude, dude, Geoff, Geoff, Geoff. It fucking does.
[28:32.520 --> 28:37.600]  It really, really does. It looks like a lot of the kids that dropped out of my high school.
[28:38.820 --> 28:41.440]  They look like dropped out of a Morton Joes crew.
[28:41.680 --> 28:43.860]  Yes, it's the same thing.
[28:44.220 --> 28:45.880]  Oh, Eureka's Castle was awesome.
[28:45.920 --> 28:48.200]  I just posted Eureka's Castle.
[28:48.540 --> 28:50.460]  Isn't that an R.L. Stine show?
[28:50.460 --> 28:52.020]  Yeah, it was.
[28:53.420 --> 28:54.220]  That's insane.
[28:55.340 --> 28:56.380]  Oh, here's Button Moon.
[28:57.540 --> 29:00.020]  Button Moon? I want to just hear a moment.
[29:02.340 --> 29:06.540]  Okay, yeah, this is great.
[29:12.280 --> 29:17.320]  Hey, Nick, you should make your kid watch that and see if it holds his attention longer than three seconds.
[29:18.600 --> 29:25.080]  That is such a great. I mean, I don't want to put Nick's kid in the content like as an outsider.
[29:25.280 --> 29:33.660]  But the premise of us picking what we think were banger childhood shows and seeing Nick's kid grade them is very funny.
[29:34.700 --> 29:35.720]  Oh, all right.
[29:36.180 --> 29:39.880]  Do you think he would like this guy from the Great Space Coaster? That's another one.
[29:40.300 --> 29:45.060]  I don't know if I like that guy. I'm terrified. It's like a clown almost.
[29:45.060 --> 29:50.780]  He has a red nose, a rainbow shirt, and he's very large. Hollow eyes.
[29:50.860 --> 29:55.900]  Look at this fucking elephant, though. Doesn't that look like the stuff we did at Meow Wolf, Gavin?
[29:57.140 --> 29:59.680]  Yeah, it does. Like the ears and all the different segments.
[30:00.560 --> 30:05.900]  Wow. Yeah, that clown looks like if an animal dressed as a human, it would kind of look like that.
[30:06.460 --> 30:10.140]  Yeah, yeah. He looks like he's got a knife, I think.
[30:10.600 --> 30:11.100]  It does.
[30:12.320 --> 30:14.560]  He would definitely be stopped at TSA.
[30:14.560 --> 30:19.300]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah. They're checking his phone. They want to look at his social media.
[30:20.080 --> 30:26.180]  He has a bomb strapped to his heart rate monitor at all times, so if he goes, everyone else is going around him.
[30:26.460 --> 30:29.740]  You know what else about that clown, though? I guarantee you he uses a CPAP.
[30:31.280 --> 30:34.120]  Yeah. He has to. He doesn't have a choice.
[30:34.900 --> 30:38.880]  Yeah, and the magician conjures it up so it doesn't really work too well.
[30:40.880 --> 30:45.860]  This whole thing, it's made out of wishes and dreams, so it's really fucking him up at night.
[30:47.080 --> 30:48.880]  Made from wishes and dreams.
[30:49.620 --> 30:54.280]  Geoff, Teddy Ruxpin, was that a thing? You were too old for that, or no?
[30:54.600 --> 31:00.500]  I was too old for Teddy Ruxpin, but I wasn't so old I wasn't very aware of it.
[31:00.500 --> 31:02.860]  Right, I mean, it was like a big thing.
[31:03.140 --> 31:08.800]  Let's see, he came out in, let me see, Teddy Ruxpin came out in 19...
[31:08.800 --> 31:09.980]  Probably the mid-80s, I would think.
[31:10.940 --> 31:15.980]  86, I guess? 85, 86? I was 10, 11. Probably just a bit too old.
[31:16.040 --> 31:18.200]  If I'd have been like three years younger, I'd have probably been right up his ass.
[31:18.520 --> 31:21.360]  Yeah. Right up his ass.
[31:21.640 --> 31:24.960]  I don't know if that's the way you want to describe Teddy Ruxpin, but yeah, man, that's cool.
[31:25.660 --> 31:26.580]  I don't... yeah.
[31:27.220 --> 31:28.360]  The 80s were different.
[31:29.100 --> 31:30.280]  They sure were.
[31:30.740 --> 31:35.220]  I know, you keep showing us a bunch of different fucking 80s stuff and I don't want to watch it.
[31:37.980 --> 31:39.920]  At least I didn't make you watch Losing It.
[31:40.360 --> 31:43.720]  Oh, fuck. Please no. It's so bad.
[31:44.560 --> 31:48.960]  Gavin, did you guys have Teddy Ruxpin in England, or was his name like, they have like a different name?
[31:49.300 --> 31:50.120]  Ruxy Spinspin.
[31:50.400 --> 31:52.120]  Or is it like a totally foreign thing to you?
[31:52.160 --> 31:54.640]  Yeah, it might have been like Ruxy Buxy, or I don't know.
[31:55.040 --> 31:56.960]  Let me know, does that look like Ruxy Buxy?
[31:56.960 --> 31:58.140]  That's him.
[31:59.520 --> 32:00.860]  Ruxy Buxy.
[32:01.540 --> 32:02.480]  It's Reginald Buxton.
[32:03.060 --> 32:05.200]  Yeah, Theodore Buxton.
[32:05.320 --> 32:06.100]  Reginald Buxton.
[32:09.360 --> 32:12.940]  I felt... so, sort of exciting news.
[32:13.340 --> 32:20.660]  Shane, Pencil Judge extraordinaire, Survivor contestant, has joined our community Discord.
[32:21.360 --> 32:22.780]  Which was very exciting.
[32:23.200 --> 32:24.400]  That is insane to me.
[32:24.640 --> 32:25.780]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[32:25.780 --> 32:29.360]  And he posted the sweetest message when he joined.
[32:29.460 --> 32:34.280]  Just like thanking all the regulation listeners and comment leavers and whatnot for support.
[32:35.900 --> 32:38.160]  And it was like this exciting moment.
[32:38.200 --> 32:39.600]  And people are like, whoa!
[32:40.180 --> 32:42.700]  The gene's here, that's crazy, that's awesome.
[32:43.320 --> 32:48.740]  And then like the fourth reply was Mark the Frog complaining about having to use body wash as shampoo.
[32:49.360 --> 32:50.240]  And I felt so bad.
[32:50.660 --> 32:52.080]  God, he's the fucking best.
[32:52.500 --> 32:53.940]  He's just like...
[32:53.940 --> 33:00.020]  In his own world, doesn't have any concept of anything that's happening.
[33:01.660 --> 33:04.340]  I love him so much, I love him so much.
[33:05.320 --> 33:07.880]  He is a unique human being, for sure.
[33:08.800 --> 33:09.940]  Have you met him, Geoff?
[33:10.560 --> 33:11.080]  In person?
[33:11.600 --> 33:13.300]  Yeah, well that was the thing he was talking about.
[33:14.360 --> 33:18.320]  He was saying, I was trying to throw away baseball cards and he was like, I'm gonna drive up and get them.
[33:18.360 --> 33:21.060]  And I was like, if you wanna drive all the way up from Florida, you can have them.
[33:21.400 --> 33:22.500]  But I don't think he's actually gonna do it.
[33:22.500 --> 33:25.480]  He calculated the gas and it was gonna be over a thousand dollars in gas.
[33:25.840 --> 33:27.620]  Holy shit, really?
[33:27.620 --> 33:29.280]  Maybe not worth it for some guards.
[33:29.780 --> 33:30.540]  Hell no.
[33:30.640 --> 33:31.760]  Not for these guards, for sure.
[33:32.660 --> 33:34.800]  Do you ever think about the turkey you left in that fridge?
[33:35.200 --> 33:36.240]  I still think about it.
[33:37.160 --> 33:38.240]  The hotel fridge.
[33:40.720 --> 33:43.420]  I'd be lying if I said no.
[33:45.780 --> 33:49.600]  What happened to it? It's like one of our great mysteries. We'll never know, but...
[33:49.600 --> 33:50.720]  Here's what bugs me about it.
[33:50.720 --> 33:53.380]  It smelled so good and it looked so amazing.
[33:53.740 --> 33:57.280]  And then I ordered another one, you know, like a month later for Christmas.
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.180]  And it just wasn't great.
[33:59.500 --> 34:01.020]  It wasn't anywhere near what I remember.
[34:01.480 --> 34:05.240]  And I feel like the first turkey was, though.
[34:05.680 --> 34:08.260]  Yeah, you lost the hot dog roulette with the turkeys.
[34:08.360 --> 34:10.700]  Yeah, I feel like I lost hot dog roulette on the turkeys.
[34:10.740 --> 34:13.540]  And I feel like the vibe of the first turkey was fucking aces.
[34:14.760 --> 34:22.820]  And then this kind of tainted, like now I don't necessarily want to go and pay like 70 bucks to, you know, have another turkey shipped to me.
[34:22.980 --> 34:23.720]  No, totally.
[34:23.720 --> 34:28.120]  On dry ice or whatever, because I already did it twice and I didn't really enjoy the one that I had.
[34:28.200 --> 34:30.880]  But damn it, I just... it breaks my heart.
[34:31.320 --> 34:38.400]  Is that the number one item for heartbreak that you've ever misplaced or like lost? Could not retrieve again?
[34:40.820 --> 34:41.700]  No, no.
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.800]  Back when I was drinking, I gave somebody all of my baseball cards and comic books and I don't remember who.
[34:48.120 --> 34:49.160]  Oh, God.
[34:49.640 --> 34:50.440]  That's awful.
[34:50.740 --> 34:51.600]  I remember doing it.
[34:51.700 --> 34:58.080]  I remember going into the back house and digging them out of a pile of crap and being like, your kid can have these if they want them.
[34:58.100 --> 34:58.840]  They'll never be worth anything.
[34:59.000 --> 34:59.460]  I don't want them.
[34:59.480 --> 35:00.060]  I'll never use them.
[35:00.720 --> 35:05.120]  And I just, I cannot for the life of me remember who that human being was.
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.060]  But I gave them thousands and thousands.
[35:07.060 --> 35:11.440]  And looking back on it now, I so desperately wanted them when I started collecting again.
[35:11.600 --> 35:13.320]  And I really regret that.
[35:13.480 --> 35:18.300]  I really regret giving up my entire childhood because I think I was probably really drunk.
[35:18.700 --> 35:21.380]  I like that that's the version of person you become when you're drunk though.
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.060]  You're just generous.
[35:23.040 --> 35:24.460]  Yeah, I guess so.
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.480]  That's a tough situation because even if you knew who it was, it's still not easy to get them back.
[35:29.820 --> 35:31.540]  No, and I wouldn't try to get him back.
[35:31.540 --> 35:32.140]  No, you can't.
[35:32.440 --> 35:35.840]  I wouldn't try to get him back, but I might check in with that person and be like,
[35:35.900 --> 35:37.740]  Hey, you remember like 10 years ago when I gave you all that?
[35:37.920 --> 35:38.660]  Did your kid like it?
[35:38.760 --> 35:39.400]  Would he appreciate it?
[35:39.440 --> 35:40.980]  You know, I never heard back, you know.
[35:41.540 --> 35:43.020]  I hope that was a good gift, you know.
[35:44.340 --> 35:47.720]  I feel like it almost is in a way an advantage that you don't know.
[35:48.080 --> 35:48.900]  It's probably better.
[35:49.020 --> 35:53.520]  I see some 17 year old kid driving around in a fucking brand new car that he bought off all my old baseball cards.
[35:55.720 --> 35:57.720]  What do you, what do you estimate the value of them was?
[35:58.200 --> 35:59.280]  You know, I don't know.
[35:59.280 --> 36:03.280]  I would love to go back and look because there's stuff that wasn't valuable then that is now.
[36:03.500 --> 36:06.040]  And stuff that was valuable then that isn't valuable now.
[36:06.400 --> 36:08.180]  And so I really don't know what I had.
[36:08.720 --> 36:09.520]  Do you have any pictures of him?
[36:09.860 --> 36:10.160]  No.
[36:10.340 --> 36:12.760]  A couple thousand on the low end.
[36:12.900 --> 36:13.420]  And who knows?
[36:13.980 --> 36:17.900]  Like some of my 80s football cards were worth a lot.
[36:18.220 --> 36:19.720]  Like I had Jerry Rice Rookie back in the day.
[36:19.780 --> 36:20.860]  That's a lot of money now.
[36:21.720 --> 36:22.800]  But yeah, I don't know.
[36:23.340 --> 36:24.720]  I just, I really don't.
[36:25.580 --> 36:30.160]  I stopped collecting at 17 and I hadn't looked at them since I was 17, so.
[36:31.040 --> 36:33.720]  What about you Gavin? Have you ever misplaced anything valuable to you?
[36:35.800 --> 36:36.680]  Um, yeah.
[36:38.980 --> 36:40.860]  I, it's always game consoles.
[36:41.140 --> 36:43.280]  Like I really wish I had my childhood Super Nintendo.
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.020]  I have that chromed, that chrome skinned original Xbox that I don't know where it is.
[36:49.300 --> 36:51.660]  I just, I think my parents just gave them away.
[36:52.200 --> 36:53.540]  Or like gave them to friends and stuff.
[36:54.140 --> 36:57.620]  And I could just buy the same thing, but it's just like, ah, this wasn't...
[36:57.620 --> 36:57.760]  It's not the same.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.700]  This wasn't what got me into gaming.
[37:00.220 --> 37:01.960]  As a little four year old.
[37:03.100 --> 37:04.020]  Little chrome Xbox.
[37:05.400 --> 37:07.040]  Well, that was a little bit later, but the Super Nintendo.
[37:07.380 --> 37:11.060]  Yeah, I know, I just, I like the idea of it being chrome being like, fuck, you know what?
[37:11.080 --> 37:14.180]  I don't think I would have been an Xbox guy, but then they chromed it. Holy shit.
[37:14.460 --> 37:17.820]  I just remember spending a lot of time with the hairdryer and that sticker to get it just right.
[37:17.920 --> 37:18.520]  With no air bubbles.
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.280]  I had a kind of a similar thing where back in the old, old, old days, Gus and I used to go to garage sales all the time.
[37:27.380 --> 37:29.040]  We used to make content out of it for drunk gamers.
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.200]  And the thing that we were really doing was trying to buy video games, right?
[37:32.500 --> 37:35.340]  And old game consoles because, you know, that's what we were into.
[37:35.560 --> 37:43.720]  And so we had so much success and I had about 13 or 14 old consoles, like a TurboGrafx-16, a bunch of fun old stuff, Sega Saturn, Sega CD.
[37:44.360 --> 37:46.960]  And that we had collected over the years and I didn't have anywhere to put them.
[37:46.960 --> 37:50.720]  So I put them up in the attic in the first house that I owned when we lived there together.
[37:50.940 --> 37:57.940]  And then after I sold the house and moved, I realized about like two weeks after I'd moved, I never cleaned out the attic.
[37:58.100 --> 37:59.880]  I have all those consoles up there.
[38:00.140 --> 38:06.940]  And I thought, I'm definitely not going to go bug the new owner to crawl up there and get them.
[38:07.100 --> 38:09.740]  So I guess I don't collect consoles anymore.
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.740]  And I haven't since.
[38:10.920 --> 38:14.020]  I was like, if I don't want it badly enough to go do that, go have that inconvenience.
[38:14.220 --> 38:16.640]  I guess I just don't want that shit anymore and I should stop buying it.
[38:16.640 --> 38:17.180]  So I did.
[38:17.500 --> 38:18.480]  You could have heisted.
[38:20.660 --> 38:22.640]  Like Andrew with the Chinese food menus?
[38:22.980 --> 38:25.140]  Yep. Sneak in, get your stuff.
[38:25.240 --> 38:26.740]  Bit harder when it's on the inside though.
[38:26.880 --> 38:27.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:28.980 --> 38:33.180]  But technically it would just be trespass, right? Or breaking in a ring. It wouldn't be actual burglary.
[38:33.700 --> 38:36.140]  Well, I sold the house to her and everything in it.
[38:36.220 --> 38:39.320]  So like if I went in and started pulling out the oven, that wouldn't be cool either.
[38:40.060 --> 38:42.360]  Like, oh, I decided after the fact I wanted this oven.
[38:43.140 --> 38:46.260]  I think the lady owned him at that point.
[38:46.740 --> 38:51.340]  I have an exciting thing to reveal relating to our movie league.
[38:51.600 --> 38:55.580]  I teased it in the past that we have a trophy for first place.
[38:56.320 --> 38:59.820]  I currently have a relic, a symbol of victory.
[39:00.200 --> 39:02.100]  There are many things we could have went with.
[39:02.940 --> 39:05.700]  I think there's no greater than this.
[39:06.200 --> 39:07.560]  I currently have it in my possession.
[39:08.340 --> 39:19.080]  The trophy of our movie league is none other than a rare, collectible, sealed copy of VHS Mouse Hunt.
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.980]  9.4 graded, A++ seal quality.
[39:24.460 --> 39:25.320]  Phenomenal.
[39:26.400 --> 39:28.160]  And that's gorgeous.
[39:28.560 --> 39:32.220]  It's beautiful. We have a little bit of a history with the film.
[39:32.220 --> 39:34.300]  I was the past winner.
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.340]  I'm currently holding it, but whoever wins gets the mouse hunt.
[39:38.800 --> 39:40.960]  And that one didn't get stolen from your doorstep.
[39:41.200 --> 39:43.800]  It didn't. No, that one made it.
[39:44.240 --> 39:45.080]  That's great.
[39:45.240 --> 39:47.660]  It was so cool.
[39:48.100 --> 39:50.800]  Yeah, it's got the picture of them and the mousetraps on the back.
[39:50.860 --> 39:52.840]  Lee Evans has it on his lip. Amazing.
[39:53.280 --> 39:55.520]  I think it's the only one out there.
[39:55.680 --> 39:58.520]  I don't think there are any other graded mouse hunts on VHS.
[39:59.560 --> 40:00.780]  Wow. One of one.
[40:00.780 --> 40:02.740]  One of one.
[40:03.600 --> 40:07.340]  And speaking of the movie league, I've already had my first disappointment.
[40:08.020 --> 40:14.440]  I thought I had the steal of the fucking draft with Fight or Flight and it made two million dollars total.
[40:16.680 --> 40:18.740]  I never saw it advertised once.
[40:19.080 --> 40:21.400]  Yeah, I don't think it was really.
[40:21.540 --> 40:24.280]  I thought it was... I got sucked in, I think.
[40:24.360 --> 40:25.640]  I thought the premise was so fun.
[40:26.420 --> 40:28.340]  It's already out of theaters, I think.
[40:28.540 --> 40:29.720]  It's not tracking.
[40:29.720 --> 40:38.420]  I realized it was in trouble when it opened in like eighth place and Clown in a Cornfield opened on the same weekend and was in sixth.
[40:38.960 --> 40:40.440]  Worse than Clown in a Cornfield.
[40:41.160 --> 40:43.860]  Which I'm so fucking sick of, by the way.
[40:44.420 --> 40:49.900]  I was so convinced that I owned it that the algorithm also thought I owned it.
[40:50.040 --> 40:52.080]  So I keep getting ads for it.
[40:52.380 --> 40:55.940]  I'm getting push notifications that I should go see Clown in a Cornfield.
[40:56.720 --> 40:57.780]  I should go buy tickets.
[40:58.100 --> 40:59.140]  It's so annoying.
[40:59.140 --> 41:01.200]  Do you know who directed Clown in a Cornfield?
[41:01.320 --> 41:01.940]  I found out later.
[41:02.220 --> 41:02.400]  Who?
[41:02.620 --> 41:03.220]  Eli Craig.
[41:03.600 --> 41:05.740]  Oh, Tucker and Dale guy, right?
[41:05.860 --> 41:07.160]  Yeah, but he's a nepo baby.
[41:07.300 --> 41:08.520]  Do you know who his mother is?
[41:09.040 --> 41:09.480]  Craig.
[41:10.000 --> 41:10.440]  Craig.
[41:10.920 --> 41:11.960]  It's not the same last name.
[41:12.000 --> 41:12.300]  Nope.
[41:12.540 --> 41:12.860]  Okay.
[41:13.620 --> 41:14.100]  Uh, no.
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.400]  Sally Field.
[41:15.840 --> 41:16.020]  What?
[41:16.940 --> 41:20.120]  Yeah, Sally Field's son made Clown in a Cornfield.
[41:21.000 --> 41:21.380]  What?
[41:21.800 --> 41:23.060]  Could have been Daniel Craig's son.
[41:23.700 --> 41:25.840]  Could have been Daniel Craig's son.
[41:26.200 --> 41:26.420]  Yeah.
[41:26.560 --> 41:27.660]  They should do a DNA test.
[41:27.660 --> 41:29.180]  Maybe check the paternity.
[41:30.440 --> 41:35.460]  I like the idea of like 23andMe, but just for nepotism in Hollywood.
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.020]  You can see all of the celebrities you're kind of related to.
[41:39.220 --> 41:42.060]  Just like a big branching line of nepo.
[41:44.920 --> 41:46.660]  I'm 2% Coppola.
[41:47.500 --> 41:48.200]  This is great.
[41:50.600 --> 41:51.420]  Oh, man.
[41:51.800 --> 41:54.740]  Speaking of films, I was looking at the AFI.
[41:55.220 --> 41:56.520]  That's like the definitive list, right?
[41:56.520 --> 41:59.400]  The AFI list of the top 100 films of all time recently.
[41:59.520 --> 42:02.600]  Just out of curiosity to see how many I had never seen,
[42:03.020 --> 42:03.920]  like how many I didn't recognize.
[42:04.180 --> 42:05.060]  And that got me thinking.
[42:05.120 --> 42:08.000]  I know we have a lot of movies to watch and a lot of TV shows
[42:08.000 --> 42:09.800]  and a lot of watch-along stuff.
[42:09.860 --> 42:11.760]  I'm not trying to add on to it.
[42:12.080 --> 42:17.000]  But I wonder if we all marked off every movie we've seen on the list
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.660]  and overlaid the list together.
[42:18.760 --> 42:22.180]  How many movies collectively none of us have seen?
[42:22.380 --> 42:22.980]  Oh, that's interesting.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.860]  Like how many movies are on the 100 list that none of us have seen?
[42:25.860 --> 42:30.380]  It could be a lot because there was a bunch of movies I'd never heard of on there.
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.880]  But it might be a very small list. I don't know.
[42:33.400 --> 42:34.900]  Cosmopolis isn't on the list, right?
[42:35.500 --> 42:36.120]  Not that I'm aware of.
[42:36.240 --> 42:36.680]  Okay, good.
[42:38.760 --> 42:39.720]  There's a list.
[42:40.400 --> 42:42.240]  You can mark off the ones that you've seen
[42:42.240 --> 42:45.060]  and then download a PDF with that link that I just...
[42:45.060 --> 42:45.220]  Oh, that's great.
[42:45.800 --> 42:46.280]  Oh, great.
[42:46.460 --> 42:46.680]  Amazing.
[42:47.220 --> 42:50.340]  This is from the one that we're looking at is
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.260]  AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition, though,
[42:54.260 --> 42:55.220]  which is older.
[42:55.520 --> 42:59.200]  And I wonder if maybe there's a more recent one.
[42:59.440 --> 43:01.260]  I mean, that seems like it might be it, so...
[43:01.780 --> 43:06.100]  But it's like, you know, I've never seen...
[43:06.100 --> 43:07.580]  A lot of these I haven't seen.
[43:08.180 --> 43:10.560]  Oh, God, I'm trying to look at one that I have.
[43:10.580 --> 43:11.400]  Actually, I've seen all these.
[43:11.860 --> 43:13.160]  I've never seen The General.
[43:14.320 --> 43:15.380]  1926. Wow.
[43:15.940 --> 43:18.040]  I've never seen Sullivan's Travels.
[43:18.220 --> 43:19.320]  I've never seen Duck Soup.
[43:19.380 --> 43:20.520]  I know what it is, but I've never seen it.
[43:20.820 --> 43:22.940]  I've never seen the 1975 film Nashville.
[43:22.940 --> 43:24.880]  I feel like...
[43:24.880 --> 43:27.620]  I don't feel like Cabaret needs to be on this list.
[43:30.440 --> 43:32.000]  Number 99 is Toy Story.
[43:32.440 --> 43:32.960]  I've seen it.
[43:33.680 --> 43:34.160]  I've seen that.
[43:34.880 --> 43:35.000]  Yeah.
[43:35.100 --> 43:35.660]  No, I...
[43:35.660 --> 43:37.440]  No, I think...
[43:37.440 --> 43:39.040]  Gavin and I have both seen that one, so you can mark it.
[43:39.040 --> 43:39.520]  Okay, cool.
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.260]  I just won't bother with it then.
[43:42.320 --> 43:44.100]  Oh, let's mark the list right...
[43:44.100 --> 43:45.280]  Nah, that'd be boring for the audience.
[43:45.400 --> 43:46.000]  Nevermind, we'll do it.
[43:46.020 --> 43:47.240]  Yes, it would.
[43:47.260 --> 43:48.920]  It would be fun for us and boring for the audience.
[43:48.980 --> 43:49.660]  Yeah, we don't want to do that.
[43:49.860 --> 43:50.060]  No.
[43:50.060 --> 43:52.520]  I saw really...
[43:52.520 --> 43:55.840]  Cosmopolis is the Francis Ford Coppola movie, right?
[43:55.960 --> 43:57.040]  That's his most recent one.
[43:57.340 --> 43:57.860]  Megalopolis.
[43:58.240 --> 43:58.840]  Megalopolis.
[43:59.240 --> 43:59.340]  Yeah.
[43:59.480 --> 43:59.700]  Yeah.
[44:00.020 --> 44:04.320]  I guess he doesn't want people to see that outside of a theater.
[44:04.700 --> 44:04.760]  Yes.
[44:04.760 --> 44:09.420]  He's very strict about that, so you can't get it on VOD at all.
[44:09.580 --> 44:11.560]  There's no physical copies of it.
[44:11.920 --> 44:15.840]  He's only doing screenings that he's personally doing.
[44:15.840 --> 44:22.000]  And the other way to currently watch it is I guess they had a deal with American Airlines for playing it on flights.
[44:22.500 --> 44:30.180]  So those are the only two ways in which you can currently watch it is either a screening hosted by him or on American Airlines.
[44:30.600 --> 44:34.120]  Yeah, on your phone, on a two and a half hour flight to Denver.
[44:34.440 --> 44:35.520]  Yeah, absolutely.
[44:35.860 --> 44:36.180]  It's great.
[44:36.260 --> 44:37.940]  Yeah, like what's the reasoning for theaters only?
[44:38.040 --> 44:40.840]  Like he doesn't want tiny screens and then he wants it on a plane?
[44:40.840 --> 44:45.520]  Yeah, I guess. I don't know if it was like a distributor deal.
[44:45.760 --> 44:51.520]  Yeah, if I had to guess, it was probably they financed some portion of it through him, whatever.
[44:51.640 --> 44:54.420]  There was some deal. So they get the first crack at it.
[44:54.500 --> 44:56.500]  And so there was some time thing where he had to put it on there.
[44:56.500 --> 45:02.580]  But I think that there's like mixed media stuff in this movie.
[45:02.660 --> 45:09.100]  I haven't seen it, but I think there's like a section of the movie where somebody comes and like acts something out.
[45:09.980 --> 45:13.600]  Like in front of the people. And I think that's important to him.
[45:13.880 --> 45:15.840]  And the flight attendants have to do it now?
[45:16.400 --> 45:19.100]  Yeah, you have to sync it up so they only have to do it once though.
[45:20.180 --> 45:22.540]  I've heard nothing good about that film.
[45:22.860 --> 45:23.940]  I really want to see it.
[45:24.340 --> 45:25.560]  Well, it was in the theater for a while.
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.660]  Yeah, I just, I didn't... I really want to see it in a way that Francis Ford Coppola doesn't want me to.
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.280]  Completely self-funded too, right? Like didn't he spend 300 million of his own money?
[45:36.280 --> 45:40.660]  He spent so much of his own money. I think he sold like an Italian winery he owned to fund it.
[45:40.880 --> 45:43.020]  It's always the first thing to go.
[45:44.660 --> 45:45.720]  Sell off the vineyards.
[45:46.540 --> 45:48.440]  Oh, he was going to sell two, but he forgot one.
[45:48.800 --> 45:50.300]  He's like, where is it? I don't remember.
[45:51.440 --> 45:53.680]  I don't remember where it is. I need my deed.
[45:54.620 --> 45:59.140]  Isn't that how Johnny Depp got into financial trouble is that he had too many vineyards?
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.220]  He was spending... I feel like I remember from that divorce case.
[46:05.020 --> 46:10.380]  He was spending like $20,000 a month on wine just to drink.
[46:10.980 --> 46:15.900]  Oh, that's... I'm crunching the numbers. That's a little high.
[46:16.420 --> 46:20.000]  I like Gavin's idea more. Let's just say that that's what happened.
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.800]  He had a really bad habit of getting drunk and then buying the vineyard that he was at or just having too many.
[46:27.640 --> 46:29.100]  Delicious. I'll take it.
[46:30.960 --> 46:36.200]  I just couldn't imagine being so wealthy that you own so many vineyards you didn't realize.
[46:37.020 --> 46:38.340]  I was I was wrong. I'm sorry.
[46:38.740 --> 46:46.280]  Johnny Depp spent $30,000 a month on liquor expenses, but his wine bill surged by 433% by the end of his marriage.
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.620]  God damn. Yeah. Wow.
[46:49.920 --> 46:52.680]  According to IMDB. Huh.
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.440]  I have a one question toilet quiz, if anyone's interested. Please.
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.340]  It's based on a picture that I think I saw this on Reddit and I just thought it was fascinating.
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.220]  Have you ever seen a toilet with that? Let me look at it. Let me zoom in.
[47:06.820 --> 47:10.460]  So it looks like... Boy, I hope that's from a hand.
[47:11.060 --> 47:12.380]  Is that rust? What is that?
[47:13.000 --> 47:16.860]  It's just an area of wear that appears on a lot of public toilets.
[47:16.860 --> 47:23.120]  It's just more like the enamel wore away or the paint. Yeah, the paint has worn down in a very specific area.
[47:23.600 --> 47:26.860]  Is it the hand picking up and dropping it or is it somebody's ball?
[47:27.220 --> 47:37.100]  Dude, I hope it's somebody's hand reaching between their legs to wipe their ass and not a cock and ball slapping the same spot.
[47:37.760 --> 47:42.900]  It turns out it's not the residue from multiple cock and balls smeared across it.
[47:43.940 --> 47:46.420]  It's from women's rings.
[47:48.260 --> 47:53.500]  Here's another thing about that toilet that I find odd. Where's the rest of the toilet?
[47:54.260 --> 47:58.580]  It's on some stairs. It's just a toilet seat on stairs.
[48:00.280 --> 48:06.380]  You try to use that, that's an instant mess. Don't pee in that toilet.
[48:06.940 --> 48:08.920]  Use the toilet right there, right now.
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.980]  Where is that? Maybe it's like a portable seat to use the bathroom anywhere you need.
[48:15.560 --> 48:19.140]  You bring it along with you. You take a shit right there on the stairs.
[48:21.820 --> 48:26.640]  It's like one of those stadium chairs you take to a little league game. You get an academy.
[48:28.460 --> 48:29.600]  Yep, yep.
[48:30.780 --> 48:36.920]  I only assumed it was women. Men don't wipe from the front, right?
[48:37.720 --> 48:39.520]  I don't think so. I don't.
[48:40.460 --> 48:42.140]  You'd be wiping up towards your balls.
[48:45.860 --> 48:47.900]  I was getting down there wiping my balls.
[48:48.460 --> 48:51.180]  I looked at that and I thought, I don't think I've ever put my hand down the front.
[48:54.020 --> 48:55.720]  There's no room with all your business up there.
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.340]  Honestly, we gotta shower the other way and we gotta try wiping like this.
[49:00.960 --> 49:02.680]  Gavin's a back shower, front wiper.
[49:03.280 --> 49:09.800]  I'm just worried if I was going underneath like that, and I'm trying to get to the anus, I'm gonna have knuckles in the water.
[49:11.840 --> 49:15.440]  Knuckles in the water. Is that a song? Did Van Halen sing that?
[49:16.380 --> 49:17.100]  Am I good?
[49:17.860 --> 49:18.440]  Yeah, you're fine.
[49:18.740 --> 49:19.680]  Yeah, man, you're okay.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.240]  Yeah, it was called running with the devil.
[49:23.060 --> 49:25.640]  Yeah, I guess rings are dirty.
[49:26.200 --> 49:31.600]  Yeah, I think rings are super dirty, aren't they? Isn't that a thing where you don't realize how dirty it is? Like phones?
[49:32.020 --> 49:34.160]  I don't think that's dirt, I think that's wear.
[49:34.780 --> 49:37.680]  No, I know, but it's still been scraping a public toilet seat.
[49:38.240 --> 49:41.500]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, so the ring is dirty with the paint from the toilet seat?
[49:41.800 --> 49:43.300]  Yeah, you have some toilet enamel.
[49:43.840 --> 49:46.020]  Once again, where'd you take this photo?
[49:46.500 --> 49:47.740]  I didn't take it, it was on Reddit.
[49:48.560 --> 49:49.000]  Oh, okay.
[49:49.440 --> 49:51.260]  I don't just have a toilet seat on a bed.
[49:51.640 --> 49:57.140]  He went into a women's bathroom, he took a toilet seat off, he put it on his stairs, he sent you the photo. What's the problem?
[49:57.540 --> 50:00.260]  You know what you could do? You could put a mirror behind that and you could shave in it.
[50:00.760 --> 50:03.680]  Oh, that's true. Shaving in a toilet reflection?
[50:04.320 --> 50:04.400]  Yeah.
[50:04.960 --> 50:12.080]  My outdoor mirror, by the way, completely useless now. Something happened over the winter, it's just all fogged up. I can't even see myself.
[50:12.580 --> 50:14.140]  Really? What are you gonna do?
[50:15.280 --> 50:17.820]  Break another mirror, maybe. Shave in the dark.
[50:18.800 --> 50:21.160]  You have to shave inside like a normal person? That's crazy.
[50:21.620 --> 50:23.500]  Maybe I can only shave on FaceTime.
[50:24.100 --> 50:28.260]  You could go over to Chris's house and shave in the shed with him.
[50:28.600 --> 50:29.320]  I would do that.
[50:29.320 --> 50:31.520]  Okay, never mind.
[50:34.800 --> 50:37.260]  Oh shit, the shaving shed's on fire.
[50:38.680 --> 50:39.860]  Somebody call 911.
[50:40.580 --> 50:42.440]  It smells like fucking burnt hair.
[50:44.820 --> 50:49.620]  It instantly caught a blaze due to all the beard trimmings from multiple shaves.
[50:50.280 --> 50:51.860]  Oh, I told you where all the hair ended up, didn't I?
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.580]  I don't remember. Birds took it, right?
[50:54.860 --> 50:58.000]  Yeah, it's in my gut. It's stuffed my gut with my own hair.
[51:00.400 --> 51:01.760]  I really teach you.
[51:02.300 --> 51:05.420]  It's keeping the birds nice and warm though, and the squirrels.
[51:05.580 --> 51:09.300]  Oh man, your gutters look like if you wore a v-neck t-shirt.
[51:10.860 --> 51:12.260]  It's all the hair sticking out the top.
[51:13.300 --> 51:14.920]  Yeah, it's on my roof's chest.
[51:15.780 --> 51:19.540]  Have there been any... you're in the card game, Geoff.
[51:19.560 --> 51:22.020]  Are there any other collectibles you're into at the moment beyond cards?
[51:23.660 --> 51:29.140]  Uh, yeah. What am I into besides cards right now?
[51:29.200 --> 51:30.780]  What have I been buying? I know I've been buying something.
[51:31.500 --> 51:33.420]  I'm curious if you would...
[51:33.420 --> 51:36.680]  So the Canucks are changing all of the seating in the arena.
[51:37.140 --> 51:40.120]  And they're also penny-pinching.
[51:40.120 --> 51:41.640]  But thankfully, this is going to charity.
[51:41.980 --> 51:46.980]  But they're offering season ticket holders the ability to buy their old seat for $50.
[51:47.700 --> 51:49.900]  Would you buy a shitty stadium seat?
[51:49.900 --> 51:52.420]  For $50? That's a steal!
[51:52.720 --> 51:54.860]  That's practically free. 100% I would.
[51:54.880 --> 52:02.600]  If I was a season ticket holder, and my seat was going on sale, and it was $50, I would buy it, no hesitation.
[52:02.780 --> 52:05.980]  I'd buy it for $500, probably, if it was my season ticket seat.
[52:06.100 --> 52:06.960]  Yeah, probably will be.
[52:06.960 --> 52:07.500]  I think that was shipping.
[52:11.400 --> 52:14.500]  I guess baseballs and baseball bats I'm kind of into right now.
[52:15.420 --> 52:18.620]  But fucking all of our wives sure collect stuff these days.
[52:18.620 --> 52:19.200]  The boo-boos?
[52:19.480 --> 52:21.720]  The boo-boos, holy shit.
[52:21.760 --> 52:23.420]  What the fuck? What is going on?
[52:23.740 --> 52:24.780]  I don't get that one at all.
[52:25.280 --> 52:30.680]  Dude, it's like sometimes the fucking bat phone will ring, and then suddenly Emily will be like,
[52:30.740 --> 52:31.760]  I've got to go right now!
[52:31.980 --> 52:36.160]  And she's just out the door with one sandal on and a purse with shit spilling out of it.
[52:36.380 --> 52:40.560]  And she comes back two hours later with fucking three pink stuffed animals.
[52:42.220 --> 52:48.360]  This is the saddest collectible thing I've seen of also the Canucks.
[52:48.480 --> 52:50.540]  Once again, try to make money however they can.
[52:51.400 --> 52:53.140]  Player-worn shoes, $50.
[52:54.140 --> 52:54.460]  Oh.
[52:54.680 --> 53:01.620]  Not even specialty shoes, just old shoes that players have used and don't want anymore in a bucket.
[53:01.840 --> 53:03.940]  How can you sell used shoes?
[53:04.140 --> 53:08.520]  But you could, like, here's the thing, if there was presentation to this,
[53:08.520 --> 53:11.880]  like they were in a box and it's signed by the player or whatever,
[53:12.120 --> 53:15.500]  that could be some kind of faux collector's item.
[53:15.840 --> 53:18.280]  That's a bucket of shoes.
[53:18.780 --> 53:20.480]  That's a bucket of shoes.
[53:20.940 --> 53:27.380]  Like, I think we have from the Break Show an autographed John Starks, like, New York Knicks shoe,
[53:27.500 --> 53:29.760]  but the presentation is totally different.
[53:30.180 --> 53:30.540]  Yeah. Yes.
[53:31.060 --> 53:34.060]  It's also not clear what player owns what shoe.
[53:34.500 --> 53:35.480]  Yes, exactly.
[53:36.100 --> 53:37.680]  Like, it's just a disaster.
[53:37.680 --> 53:41.300]  It's clearly the equipment manager was going to throw all these away,
[53:41.380 --> 53:43.740]  and somebody's like, we could try to sell these. $50.
[53:44.400 --> 53:45.900]  That's $300 worth of shoes right there.
[53:45.960 --> 53:48.920]  You got to go by smell and shoe size, I guess, to figure out who they belong to.
[53:50.740 --> 53:52.440]  Yeah, usually when you buy stuff like that,
[53:52.660 --> 53:57.240]  it's not like you're rummaging for the other one through the rest of the things.
[53:57.440 --> 53:57.900]  Oh, yeah.
[53:58.020 --> 54:01.120]  Like, if there's one, do they sell them in pairs, I wonder?
[54:01.260 --> 54:02.800]  Like, are they tied? I have no idea.
[54:04.180 --> 54:07.240]  $50, having to pay $100 if it's like $50 per shoe.
[54:07.600 --> 54:09.020]  Would you say they're tools of the trade?
[54:09.800 --> 54:10.160]  No.
[54:10.780 --> 54:11.140]  Oh.
[54:11.600 --> 54:12.880]  Because they don't play in them.
[54:14.820 --> 54:16.240]  They don't play in a towel, either.
[54:16.720 --> 54:18.260]  No, but they use it during the game.
[54:18.720 --> 54:19.260]  Oh, okay.
[54:19.340 --> 54:22.620]  At no point in the activity of the sport are they using shoes.
[54:23.440 --> 54:24.860]  Although that would be a great rule.
[54:24.960 --> 54:26.080]  That could be a sports improvement.
[54:26.980 --> 54:31.620]  Instead of, like, a power play being one person has to go out and sit in the box,
[54:31.620 --> 54:34.520]  the team has to wear running shoes for two minutes.
[54:34.680 --> 54:37.060]  They have to take the skates off and put on normal shoes.
[54:38.480 --> 54:39.300]  That would be fun.
[54:40.040 --> 54:42.740]  That would be a funny thing you could hit, like, halfway through the game.
[54:43.020 --> 54:49.620]  If somebody, like, I don't know, hits a home run through a certain hole or you score a goal in a certain way in hockey,
[54:49.740 --> 54:52.180]  everybody, the teams just have to swap shoes.
[54:53.620 --> 54:57.100]  And you just have to play like in the other first baseman's shoes and he has to play in yours.
[54:57.540 --> 54:58.360]  That would be crazy.
[55:02.800 --> 55:05.340]  I don't think I would ever want to wear a used pair of shoes.
[55:05.880 --> 55:07.940]  Every pair of shoes you wear is a used pair of shoes.
[55:09.280 --> 55:10.100]  That's a good point.
[55:10.740 --> 55:14.020]  Didn't you get, because you got hand-me-down clothes, did you not get hand-me-down shoes?
[55:15.440 --> 55:17.320]  Can we, let's correct the verbiage here.
[55:17.560 --> 55:20.260]  He didn't get hand-me-down anything, he got hand-me-up clothes.
[55:20.520 --> 55:21.960]  Yeah, and hand-me-up toys.
[55:22.800 --> 55:24.460]  My younger brother's stuff they didn't want.
[55:26.240 --> 55:27.580]  Did you ever get hand-me-up shoes?
[55:28.160 --> 55:30.580]  No, I don't think I ever got, I don't think shoes are considered...
[55:32.820 --> 55:34.280]  They're no different than clothes.
[55:35.320 --> 55:37.360]  They have a bit of Ming in those shoes, aren't they?
[55:38.040 --> 55:39.620]  Yeah, they can be, that's for sure.
[55:40.420 --> 55:44.600]  But I feel like if it's within the family, it's the family Ming, so it's okay.
[55:45.780 --> 55:47.740]  Family Ming is Ming though, isn't it?
[55:47.940 --> 55:50.760]  It is, but it's okay to live in the family Ming.
[55:51.300 --> 55:53.420]  Yeah, but only my Ming is acceptable to me.
[55:53.980 --> 55:55.300]  You're specific to your Ming?
[55:59.080 --> 56:02.020]  Do you think that your Ming is better than other Ming's?
[56:02.120 --> 56:05.660]  Or is it just specific, like you're only comfortable in the Mingage of you?
[56:06.900 --> 56:11.180]  I just, I think I can manage my own Mingage pretty well.
[56:11.360 --> 56:14.300]  Whose Ming would you be more okay with, your brother's or Dan's?
[56:15.660 --> 56:16.100]  Brother?
[56:17.020 --> 56:17.180]  Yeah.
[56:18.620 --> 56:19.960]  Good choice, by the way.
[56:20.060 --> 56:20.920]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:21.260 --> 56:22.260]  I don't think Mingage...
[56:30.060 --> 56:32.620]  How many of those shoes did you buy, by the way, Andrew?
[56:32.980 --> 56:35.140]  Zero, but I'd buy them all if I could.
[56:36.060 --> 56:36.900]  Send them to Nick.
[56:37.040 --> 56:39.000]  No, he's the anti-shoe guy, why would I do that?
[56:39.340 --> 56:41.680]  Yeah, that's like shoes are his kryptonite.
[56:42.340 --> 56:45.740]  Dude, we had Nick screaming, Nick loves MILFs the other day.
[56:46.500 --> 56:47.580]  100% he livestreamed.
[56:48.280 --> 56:49.480]  It was fucking crazy.
[56:50.420 --> 56:51.620]  Oh, is the MILFs leaked over?
[56:52.300 --> 56:53.240]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[56:53.240 --> 56:56.400]  He's just trying to get away from feed, so he's screaming about how he loves MILFs.
[56:58.520 --> 57:01.320]  I wonder if milfeet.com is available.
[57:02.260 --> 57:04.040]  I'm not going to Google it, go nuts.
[57:04.600 --> 57:05.320]  Wouldn't it be filth?
[57:05.660 --> 57:07.520]  Oh, it's taken by GoDaddy.
[57:07.560 --> 57:08.880]  Oh no, yeah, sorry, it's unavailable.
[57:09.240 --> 57:12.680]  Now, are you saying milfeet, M-I-L-F-F-E-E-T?
[57:13.400 --> 57:14.580]  You've got to do one F.
[57:15.220 --> 57:15.920]  Like milfeet?
[57:16.360 --> 57:17.860]  Yeah, milfeet.
[57:19.100 --> 57:20.500]  What about milfeat?
[57:21.300 --> 57:22.600]  That's a different thing, I think.
[57:22.700 --> 57:25.420]  Sorry, milfeat is unavailable as well.
[57:25.420 --> 57:26.480]  Sorry, Nick.
[57:27.020 --> 57:29.360]  Maybe we can get you milfeet.store.
[57:31.200 --> 57:32.240]  Milfeet.feet.
[57:35.880 --> 57:38.600]  I wouldn't be bothered by mingage in the feet.
[57:39.400 --> 57:39.920]  What do you mean?
[57:40.080 --> 57:40.220]  I would.
[57:40.760 --> 57:41.860]  It doesn't bother me.
[57:42.540 --> 57:46.180]  Yeah, but my feet are never clean.
[57:46.460 --> 57:47.640]  I don't think feet are ever clean.
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.700]  But you can get athlete's foot from somebody else.
[57:50.960 --> 57:53.540]  That's a great point, I'm immediately on your side.
[57:53.540 --> 57:55.220]  That was really quick, you're right.
[57:56.240 --> 57:57.420]  Yeah, you don't want that.
[57:57.820 --> 57:59.600]  Yeah, that's a fair point.
[57:59.800 --> 58:00.880]  Why aren't your feet ever clean?
[58:01.420 --> 58:03.340]  Well, I mean, they are clean, but you know what I mean?
[58:03.380 --> 58:04.560]  I feel like they're always dirty.
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.320]  They're walking around.
[58:06.960 --> 58:08.060]  They're touching stuff.
[58:08.640 --> 58:09.160]  Are you barefoot?
[58:09.760 --> 58:10.960]  Oh yeah, all the time.
[58:11.020 --> 58:12.220]  Oh, that's your problem.
[58:12.780 --> 58:13.520]  I don't like socks.
[58:14.740 --> 58:16.060]  They're the pants of the foot.
[58:18.880 --> 58:19.680]  They're restrictive.
[58:21.640 --> 58:23.420]  Need to let him breathe, as Nick says.
[58:23.840 --> 58:26.020]  He likes to spread his toes out.
[58:27.500 --> 58:29.760]  He's breathing through dirt, though, if you're barefoot.
[58:30.280 --> 58:31.440]  I'm breathing through dirt.
[58:31.660 --> 58:35.040]  Nick, is this conversation getting you all hot and bothered?
[58:35.500 --> 58:36.440]  Or is that just the food?
[58:36.440 --> 58:37.560]  No, that's just the hot dogs.
[58:37.840 --> 58:38.660]  Yeah, that's just the hot dogs.
[58:39.060 --> 58:40.300]  Yeah, it's just the hot dogs.
[58:42.440 --> 58:44.880]  Nick, are you worried that you're running out of time to wear the mask?
[58:45.640 --> 58:47.220]  Oh, what is it, May?
[58:47.840 --> 58:48.100]  Yeah.
[58:48.280 --> 58:48.520]  No.
[58:49.260 --> 58:49.580]  Okay.
[58:49.720 --> 58:53.180]  Now, I will say, the way he said, oh, makes me think that it's something that he totally forgot.
[58:53.900 --> 58:58.000]  Yeah, which is good, because a lot of people thought he was wearing it in episode 53, I believe.
[58:58.460 --> 59:00.760]  But the rule is I have to reveal it at the end of the episode.
[59:01.020 --> 59:01.800]  Yes, it's true.
[59:02.240 --> 59:02.660]  It's true.
[59:04.780 --> 59:06.420]  I need to get it from the other office.
[59:09.920 --> 59:10.240]  We're safe!
[59:10.240 --> 59:11.440]  Like I said.
[59:12.380 --> 59:15.660]  This comes out in June, so the second watch is coming to an end.
[59:16.520 --> 59:17.380]  Who had the second watch?
[59:18.640 --> 59:19.500]  Let's say it was me.
[59:19.880 --> 59:21.640]  I think I'm doing the fall.
[59:23.120 --> 59:24.100]  Who's the last line?
[59:24.800 --> 59:26.400]  Was it you, Andrew? Were you the last one?
[59:26.920 --> 59:27.280]  Maybe.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.320]  Do we share? It's one bullet, right? We share one bullet?
[59:30.880 --> 59:31.120]  Yeah.
[59:31.180 --> 59:32.500]  I believe that's correct, yeah.
[59:34.260 --> 59:35.120]  I'll take the end.
[59:35.760 --> 59:35.960]  Okay.
[59:36.460 --> 59:37.300]  It never gets to me.
[59:37.380 --> 59:39.420]  Wait, wait, wait. We each have a bullet, don't we?
[59:39.920 --> 59:42.940]  No, I tried to pitch that we each get a bullet, and I was told no.
[59:42.940 --> 59:51.420]  We only get one bullet, but the watch is when you are more heightened in trying to...
[59:51.700 --> 59:52.420]  Yeah, it's your responsibility.
[59:52.960 --> 59:56.880]  Now, we are getting close to time, which means we do need to start wrapping up.
[59:56.940 --> 01:00:05.620]  However, something we have not talked about is that Gavin has been live on our Discord this entire time with a game that doesn't exist on his Xbox to see if it will load.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.020]  And so far, it will not.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]  Oh, right. Let me see.
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.860]  So, how did you uncover that you have a game that... what do you mean?
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.300]  I got like an empty game.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:19.720]  Oh, that's 3D Ultra Mini Golf to me, buddy.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:20.900]  See this.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.300]  Empty.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.280]  Oh.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:23.980]  Empty game.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.100]  What was the last thing you played?
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.000]  3D Ultra Mini Golf.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:29.440]  Before that.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.600]  See, you see what happened to me?
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.280]  I mean, he knew what you were.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.440]  So, you loaded in Hitman, and then you loaded in 3D Ultra, and there's some fictional thing in the middle?
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.860]  Yeah, and it's a shortcut to the queue.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.520]  Ha!
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:42.920]  Weird.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.860]  Yeah, but then when you go to like...
[01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.920]  Yeah, when you press start on it, show him that.
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:48.980]  Because this is weird.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.960]  Take me to the game cart.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.540]  I should record this, shouldn't I, for the...
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.220]  You're kind of late now.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.620]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.200]  So, it takes me to the queue.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.400]  Yeah, but what about the game cart?
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:01.600]  Go back.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:02.640]  And then...
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:05.840]  Oh!
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.180]  Okay, so it's just like a bug related to that.
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.260]  And you fixed that immediately.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.900]  We just watched him earlier go to manage.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.260]  Yeah, I went to manage, and it took me to this empty...
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.520]  Yeah, I got it.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.980]  And then we said, oh, we'll just leave it here, and maybe it'll find it eventually, like while we're doing this episode.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.460]  Hit install to see what happens.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.780]  It's the expansion, it's the DLC, that's what...
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:27.040]  It's the DLC.
[01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:27.780]  Yeah.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:29.960]  No.
[01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.060]  Okay.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.480]  Doesn't appear that way for me.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:35.060]  But I already had it installed.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:39.740]  So, I got my shortcut to a 15-year-old DLC.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.480]  Yeah, that you couldn't buy through the game.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.120]  Pin it! Pin it to your front page!
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.880]  Yeah, just in case you want to use it later.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.920]  What a video that turned out to be, huh?
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.300]  We only did half, also.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:57.360]  The DLC that we downloaded for 3D Ultra Mini Golf, that I don't think we ever played over at Achievement Hunter.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:01.420]  At least if we did, I don't remember it, but I'm sure some sleuth will tell me I played it 18 times.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:07.880]  It has this cool new bug in it where sometimes other people's balls will just become invisible.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:12.640]  And so you don't know where they are, and you just have to hope you don't hit it.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:13.880]  And you always hit it.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.100]  Boy, you always...
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:15.280]  Every time.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.440]  Every fucking time.
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.080]  Super frustrating.
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:18.380]  Super frustrating.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:27.220]  Speaking of not remembering stuff, it's been a while now since it came out, but Geoff and I went back to Achievement City to do a little tour of our old builds.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:31.220]  And I'm embarrassed at how little I remember of them.
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:33.280]  I kind of remember the games, but the names of them.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.280]  Jesus.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.500]  I think I found like three The Pits while we were walking around.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.700]  People were like, how can they not remember that stuff?
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.160]  By the way, that video got 400,000 views in four days.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:44.680]  That's pretty cool.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.660]  Thank you so much for watching it.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.120]  I saw somebody, I'll paraphrase what I saw somebody say on a YouTube comment, which was like,
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:58.340]  I'm listening to them not remember what Cloud Down is when it's standing right in front of them.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.000]  Makes my heart hurt as it was like such an important video to me when I was a kid.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.260]  But then I realized, you know, to them, that was just a Tuesday.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:11.560]  And that's really kind of like at the end of the day, like we were cranking them out so fast and we were building them.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.420]  I never watched most of those videos.
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.340]  Like I probably watched like the first 15 as we were finding the tone and the voice.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.360]  But once we had it, Gavin was editing them.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.220]  I didn't need to watch it.
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:21.760]  I was in it.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.440]  I used to export them and play them for the room and anyone who wanted to watch the whole thing could.
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.020]  But then we ended up just filming so much that we'd never did that again.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.100]  So the ones that I edited, I have a much better memory of.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.640]  But as soon as I handed it off.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.760]  Oh, horrific.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.340]  I'm so embarrassed.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.940]  When does it cut off for the builds?
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:45.040]  It probably cuts off after like King Gavin, maybe.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.060]  Where is that in like the timeline of a build?
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.960]  I could look at what episode number that was.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:56.620]  I'd say Gavin and I built probably the first 200 episodes.
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.540]  We really peeled off after that.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.240]  I built some stuff in Achievement City.
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.820]  I imagine it was post that.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:03.840]  Probably, yeah.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.720]  You were building stuff with Matt and Jeremy probably.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:08.080]  Which, by the way, way better builders than us.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.840]  But I think it was around...
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.560]  I made the joke or one of us made the joke in the video that we ran out of ideas around episode 100 or 200.
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.760]  And people were like, but you made another 300 videos.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.340]  What are you talking about?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.380]  No, of course we did.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.840]  We just ran out of ideas for our own little minigames.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.580]  After you make 150 of them, the well gets pretty dry.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:33.420]  And it was the kind of thing where it's like, you know, we'd spend an hour or two filming and then I would spend a day or two editing.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.200]  And then it literally was, we're done with that, it's on to the next thing.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.540]  And we never watched them after that.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.100]  But, yeah, so it's not like it was just any other Tuesday.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:47.720]  It was a great Tuesday, but then there were tons of other Tuesdays.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:49.820]  Yeah, there was a Tuesday every week.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.860]  It's kind of like when I worked on the newspaper, I worked on a weekly newspaper in the army.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.560]  You put the paper to bed on Wednesday.
[01:04:55.860 --> 01:05:03.360]  You spend Thursday to the next Wednesday caring only about those 15 pages out of anything else in the world.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.760]  It's the most important thing in the world to you.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.580]  And you put everything you have into it and then you put it out.
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:11.940]  And then you erase that from your memory because you got to start over again with the next 15 pages.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:14.600]  And there's no room in your head for the past 15 pages, you know.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.220]  The worry just switches to, man, I hope the next thing we're doing works.
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:22.220]  Yeah, it's like, I got to figure out how to do this kind of circuit. God damn it.
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:29.000]  Hearing how emotional people got, though, and how much it meant to them was really surprising to me.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:35.520]  It was incredible to see what it meant to other people in relation to the past.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.160]  And the people being like, oh, I was 10 when I watched these.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.180]  It's like, God.
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.540]  So it's not like we didn't give a shit about the bills.
[01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:49.380]  It was just one after another. So chances are you may have watched it for longer than we spent making it.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:49.980]  Yeah.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.140]  And I think that's why we don't remember all of it.
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.600]  If you watched the video twice, you probably remember it better than I do.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:00.200]  Because I made it and acted in it once.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:05.020]  And then we were on to the next thing and we were trying to figure out how to kill chickens or whatever.
[01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:10.440]  That was definitely a sentiment I had when I was building stuff in it, is knowing how important it was to people.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:17.480]  And that being a constant thing of like, they're probably never going to look at this structure from this angle,
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.980]  but it needs to be built in case they do.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:23.220]  Because this is such an important thing to people.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.840]  Like, it should look good.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.940]  And it was funny being in a position of working on that, but then not being in the content.
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:37.000]  And there were times where something would go wrong and I would feel like maybe we'd be thrown under the bus a little bit
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.040]  in a way that wasn't necessarily reflective of what happened.
[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:46.480]  But then there were other times where I'd be like, oh yeah, oh boy, did I fuck that up. Whoops.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.080]  I think it was a version of clouds that we did, that we built it all.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:56.600]  And then we were just randomly knocking out blocks to make it difficult.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:02.140]  And I'd run the course and I'd done it a few times and I thought like, oh, this is way too easy.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.500]  This jump is... I should make this harder. I'm going to knock this block out.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.580]  But then I never ran the course again and it made that side, I think, impossible.
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.500]  And it didn't get confronted again until the video.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:19.520]  And just me thinking, oh no, I did that. I totally did that. Oh, I fucked it.
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.800]  It would be funny to find those clips of like, yeah, this one's deserved.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:24.540]  And then be like, oh no, this one's bullshit.
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:27.640]  Absolutely. Yeah. Most of them were probably bullshit.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.060]  It was just us trying to be funny.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.120]  There was one, just a very brief story because I know we got to wrap up on this,
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.100]  where we had to do a build that was under so much crunch because like the schedule got flipped around
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.300]  and like it had to be done at a time that wasn't anticipated.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:51.740]  And it was so much work. And I was trying to secure the map in a way that you guys couldn't just break through and leave the area.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:56.000]  And I did like 98% of it. And I left a small area open.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.540]  And Gavin, of course, just naturally goes to that area.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:04.840]  And he gets out and he does the thing that I spent like over an hour trying to prevent against just then.
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.180]  But I didn't know, right? I just happened.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.280]  No, you had no clue. You just decided you wanted to fuck off and go do something else.
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.600]  And you happened to find the one wall that had a small gap in it.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:23.660]  Like it was just complete coincidence. You had no idea how absurd it was that you had found what you did.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.520]  You're just like, I'm going through here. OK, I'm out now. Now I can just do what I want.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.740]  Yeah, it's like if you throw like a hundred cockroaches into a box, like one of them will find its way out.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.220]  Yeah, you were the one.
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.520]  It was such a big part of when we were making builds, you know, first you'd come up with the idea and then you would make it.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.900]  And then you'd be like, all right, how do we make it work? And then you get it to work.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.400]  And then you make sure it doesn't break every other time you use it and you try to get it to work well.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:51.600]  And then you go, OK, now how are the other four or five assholes going to try to destroy this and ruin it for us?
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:09:01.080]  And then you got to work around that. And it's like, yeah, we had a lot of like contingency chests because we would be building stuff and then be like, well, Michael's probably going to die and lose all this shit.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:05.560]  So let's bury a chest with all of the replacements in it. So we're ready to go.
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:12.520]  There was probably so much secret stuff like that in in that world that nobody ever saw.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:17.700]  That was just like tools for like in case of emergency, you know, break block kind of stuff.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:25.680]  And because because my memory of that stuff is also bad now, there's no one on Earth who knows where or what everything is.
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.480]  No, no.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:34.660]  It was funny, actually. I quickly watched another- because we made that video, the algorithm changed to like old stuff we made.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:42.840]  And, uh, I guess we did the Tower of Geoff pretty early on, which was Geoff went and hit the Tower of Pimps and you hit it in some lava on the corner.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:45.880]  That was the surprise motherfucker, wasn't it?
[01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:47.920]  Yeah. Where Jack jumped me and fell in.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:53.460]  I didn't have any memory of the Tower of Gav, which was like over 100 episodes later.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:59.960]  And it wasn't even like, Oh, I can't remember where I've hidden it. It'll be funny when I like when I see.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:05.180]  I was able to watch the whole video with absolutely no idea of what I was doing.
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:09.800]  I hid it up on one of the doors and then I was like, Oh my God, why did I put it there?
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.840]  And then I put a bunch of traps and I was like chucking dynamite. It was like watching someone else.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.900]  I had absolutely none of it came back to me when I saw it.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.820]  I was just like, Oh, I can watch these now as though they're new to me.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.980]  Yeah, crazy. That's great. That is wild.
[01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.540]  Oh, well, we should probably wrap it up, though.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.360]  Yeah, but the Achievement City stuff was really cool. People really responded to it.
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.260]  And hopefully we can do some stuff for it.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:42.020]  We talked about just sort of kicking ideas around for doing stuff with maybe Falcons in the future that has to do with like Achievement City or whatever.
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:48.120]  So stay tuned. We'll have, you know, I'm sure there's something out there for something because people are very, very into it.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.100]  Very into it. So we'll see.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.240]  Good to know.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.080]  Eric said that, but think low expectations there.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:59.540]  We're not making new Minecraft videos. I'm talking about maybe doing something with the Falcons in the future.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.640]  So just that's why you want to be on the Patreon. That's the important part.

[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:13.260]  I will say it was, I was blown away by how nostalgic I felt for it.
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:18.020]  And it was like, I think I might have said it in the video, but it made my heart smile.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:21.100]  It was really walking around it and trying to remember stuff.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:28.580]  It was like, there was a very beautiful point in my life when Gavin and I were living together in the temporary house.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:35.680]  And we were spending all weekend laughing and drinking and playing Mario, playing Minecraft, building these things.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:41.840]  And for like 45 minutes, we were on the same sofa in 2011 in that house again.
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.900]  And that just felt like, I never thought I would feel that again. It was fucking awesome.
[01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:51.720]  And I think what surprised me was the audience felt the same. People were like, wow, I'm 15 again. I've just come home from school.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:59.360]  It's like, oh, it does it for everyone. It was, it was actually like the closest thing to a time machine of like feelings of vibe that I've ever felt.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:08.260]  I've also, as much as I spent my career in Halo and have worked with Red vs. Blue and all that, it was a different feeling going into that place.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:17.780]  It felt real and alive in a way. And it was like visiting a real, like, I don't know, it was like going back to my high school.
[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:23.260]  It felt very intensely real in a way I didn't expect a video game to feel.
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:27.200]  And I liked that it was an actual version too. It wasn't just like a recreation that was very well done.
[01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:34.280]  It was an actual snapshot to the point where we stumbled across a bunch of redstone switches on the ground.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:42.560]  And I guess Ray had put those down like 13 or 12 years earlier and the payoff to us finding them was in 2025.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:46.680]  I just love that aspect of it. We're just like, what's this? And I was like, I don't know.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:49.980]  And there's frogs now, apparently. And there's frogs.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.320]  All right. Well, I guess that'll do it then. Andrew's going to take us out.
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.940]  He's got a very special message for you as we, as we end the episode.
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:07.980]  My special message is to make sure that you have yourself a wonderful day.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.520]  And thank you so much for listening to this episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:14.340]  I believe number 56. Is that right?
[01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.220]  Curious if you also realize that Panama is a Van Halen song.
[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.420]  We all learned many things when on a journey. Thank you so much for listening.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.280]  We'll be back next week or tomorrow if you watch our Let's Plays.
