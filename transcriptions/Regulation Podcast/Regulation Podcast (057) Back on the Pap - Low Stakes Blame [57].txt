[00:00.000 --> 00:03.620]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.840 --> 00:07.760]  This is number 57 and going by our 2025 nicknames,
[00:07.960 --> 00:14.580]  I am Baby Pepsi with me as always, Gassy Goo, Gizmo, The Mecha Nick and Lil Ricky B.
[00:15.020 --> 00:16.320]  Hello, everybody. How are we doing?
[00:16.800 --> 00:17.380]  I made a mistake.
[00:17.460 --> 00:18.420]  I'm great.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.200]  I messed up.
[00:21.220 --> 00:21.720]  What was your mistake?
[00:22.260 --> 00:23.680]  What did you do?
[00:24.480 --> 00:26.120]  Well, I've been having a bit of a cold, right?
[00:26.420 --> 00:26.880]  And then...
[00:26.880 --> 00:27.020]  Yeah.
[00:27.020 --> 00:33.460]  Um, I haven't been able to use the old pap because my nose has been running.
[00:33.760 --> 00:36.820]  But then I thought the sleep I'm getting is just dog shit.
[00:36.880 --> 00:41.000]  Like the other day, I fell asleep at like 6am because I couldn't sleep all night.
[00:41.520 --> 00:43.760]  So I thought last night, get back on the pap.
[00:44.940 --> 00:49.800]  And, um, nose, I guess, started running in the night with the pap pushing all the mucus
[00:49.800 --> 00:52.700]  back into my face, down my throat.
[00:53.340 --> 00:57.100]  And I woke up today with a mouthful of...
[00:57.980 --> 00:59.400]  It kind of looked like the gumpler.
[00:59.780 --> 01:02.900]  It was, it was a melted gumpler throat.
[01:03.260 --> 01:06.800]  You leaf blowered yourself with mucus, essentially.
[01:07.460 --> 01:13.080]  Yeah, I done the old mucus backwash backpipe horrendous.
[01:14.380 --> 01:16.280]  That's, uh, so...
[01:16.280 --> 01:17.500]  That's rough. Yeah, you don't sound good.
[01:18.100 --> 01:18.860]  It sounds like you're struggling.
[01:18.860 --> 01:22.880]  It seems to me that the CPAP is at best a dangerous machine to use.
[01:23.520 --> 01:25.660]  You gotta, you gotta pick your pick your battles with it.
[01:25.900 --> 01:31.640]  Uh, I would say that Gavin's experience is not the average, I would say.
[01:31.800 --> 01:37.380]  I feel like you have had a lot of problems that at least half of I have not encountered.
[01:37.620 --> 01:38.960]  It's my first cold with it.
[01:39.320 --> 01:42.220]  It is a bad combo, the cold and the CPAP, for sure.
[01:42.360 --> 01:42.520]  Yeah.
[01:43.060 --> 01:45.920]  I'm surprised that you... how long have you been up for?
[01:47.620 --> 01:48.020]  Today?
[01:48.020 --> 01:49.440]  Yeah, today.
[01:50.560 --> 01:51.260]  20 minutes?
[01:52.180 --> 01:54.520]  Okay, nevermind, that checks, that reads.
[01:54.720 --> 01:58.240]  Wait, you're... aren't you... I thought you're like an early morning guy,
[01:58.360 --> 02:00.060]  but then you're just all fucked up from this thing?
[02:00.520 --> 02:02.340]  Yeah, usually I'm up at seven or eight.
[02:04.800 --> 02:05.880]  That was the end of the sentence.
[02:06.360 --> 02:10.000]  I, yeah, I thought there was... the tone in which you delivered that
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.680]  really felt like you're gonna expand.
[02:12.720 --> 02:16.380]  You really, you ended it up as if there was something to follow.
[02:16.380 --> 02:21.420]  I'm gonna need you to be up at least 30 minutes before any recording going forward.
[02:22.060 --> 02:24.980]  You wanna take 10 minutes to gather yourself and we'll just... we'll vamp?
[02:26.280 --> 02:27.700]  No, I'm... I'm around.
[02:27.820 --> 02:30.360]  I mean, I've experienced what Gavin's gone through,
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.200]  but it's typically if I use the machine without putting water in it.
[02:33.500 --> 02:37.100]  And then there's probably a rough like 30 minutes at the start of the day.
[02:37.180 --> 02:37.960]  So you should be almost done.
[02:38.500 --> 02:40.980]  Oh, maybe I'll... maybe I'll set up in the next 10 minutes, that'd be nice.
[02:41.580 --> 02:44.700]  Can I ask what you did with the gumbler that was in your mouth when you woke up?
[02:44.700 --> 02:45.920]  Oh, God.
[02:47.040 --> 02:49.200]  OK, I was just checking, man.
[02:49.260 --> 02:50.600]  I just kind of want to see what kind of guy you were.
[02:51.160 --> 02:52.640]  Uh, well, I went for tissue immediately.
[02:52.640 --> 02:54.820]  And I thought this tissue is not built for this.
[02:56.160 --> 02:56.780]  What's not?
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.500]  It's always a risky gamble.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.000]  Yeah.
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.180]  Oh, man.
[03:04.220 --> 03:06.840]  Have you have you done like a full full nose blow?
[03:08.720 --> 03:09.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:09.900 --> 03:10.220]  OK.
[03:11.020 --> 03:12.260]  Find some down the sink.
[03:14.740 --> 03:16.820]  What percentage would you say you're at right now?
[03:18.300 --> 03:19.020]  Oh, 70.
[03:19.820 --> 03:22.160]  Wow. What were you at yesterday when we were in the office?
[03:22.880 --> 03:23.120]  85.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.440]  Yeah, you sounded great from what I could tell, at least comparatively to this.
[03:29.100 --> 03:32.540]  I felt so much better yesterday because I got good sleep the night before.
[03:32.840 --> 03:35.660]  And then I thought, you know, now's the time to go back on the pat.
[03:36.360 --> 03:37.220]  Yeah, big mistake.
[03:37.740 --> 03:39.980]  Yeah. So you re-pat a little early, you think, maybe?
[03:40.100 --> 03:41.240]  Yeah, I re-pat too early.
[03:41.240 --> 03:44.040]  I'm going to wait probably an extra day next time.
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.400]  There should be a way to do a reverse pat where everything blows out.
[03:48.660 --> 03:50.160]  You somehow have a way to go.
[03:50.300 --> 03:51.460]  Is that like a stomach pump?
[03:51.700 --> 03:53.320]  I guess. Yeah.
[03:53.380 --> 03:57.960]  I don't know where the point of entrance would be.
[03:58.260 --> 04:00.780]  I always heard about my friends when I was at school getting a stomach pump
[04:00.780 --> 04:01.860]  because they drank too much.
[04:02.340 --> 04:04.460]  But it always seemed like it was quite traumatic.
[04:04.480 --> 04:06.040]  And I never asked how they actually do it.
[04:06.480 --> 04:07.640]  Did you say always?
[04:08.020 --> 04:09.280]  Was this a common thing?
[04:09.280 --> 04:11.260]  Kids getting their stomach pumped where you grew up?
[04:11.680 --> 04:12.520]  Yeah, I grew up in England.
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.280]  Yeah, I had one friend who had like four stomach pumps, I think.
[04:21.340 --> 04:21.680]  What?
[04:23.340 --> 04:25.220]  He would just get too bevved up.
[04:25.600 --> 04:28.660]  He'd have like a ninth pint and he'd be like, oh, that was too many.
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.080]  And just walk himself to the emergency room to get pumped?
[04:32.680 --> 04:33.660]  Yeah, but I just don't know.
[04:33.900 --> 04:35.920]  Is it just a hose down the throat?
[04:36.580 --> 04:38.620]  I guess if you've done it like once.
[04:39.280 --> 04:40.740]  And you're OK with it.
[04:40.920 --> 04:42.720]  There's no barrier at that point.
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.760]  Has has has anyone here gotten their stomach pumped?
[04:47.220 --> 04:48.860]  Never, never, ever.
[04:48.940 --> 04:53.620]  And I grew up in Alabama where people did dumb shit to themselves and each other all
[04:53.620 --> 04:54.740]  fucking day long.
[04:55.200 --> 04:59.620]  And I knew one girl in high school who got her stomach pumped for taking too many aspirin,
[04:59.640 --> 05:00.000]  I think.
[05:00.240 --> 05:01.620]  But like that was it.
[05:01.940 --> 05:07.020]  Yeah, like I can't I can't think of anyone that I know that got their stomach pumped
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.420]  other than like Rod Stewart.
[05:08.420 --> 05:09.500]  Yes, that's it.
[05:11.020 --> 05:16.600]  I not only have never had my stomach pumped, it has never crossed my mind that that would
[05:16.600 --> 05:20.420]  be a solution to whatever ails me at any point in my life.
[05:20.500 --> 05:24.580]  It has never been a consideration for stomach pumps.
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.820]  Is there like a stomach pump specialist over there for you?
[05:29.900 --> 05:30.840]  Is there like a pumper?
[05:31.820 --> 05:35.000]  I think it's just like one of the machines they have behind the reception desk.
[05:35.100 --> 05:35.840]  It's like, oh, come on.
[05:35.840 --> 05:41.160]  Oh, it's like how you go into the store and get the like the liquid IV hydration or whatever.
[05:41.340 --> 05:42.080]  You just let you go.
[05:42.160 --> 05:43.720]  The other stall is stomach.
[05:43.980 --> 05:44.140]  Yeah.
[05:45.060 --> 05:45.860]  Oh, God.
[05:46.340 --> 05:47.300]  That's that was really funny.
[05:47.860 --> 05:48.940]  Thanks, man.
[05:49.020 --> 05:50.100]  I felt really good.
[05:50.200 --> 05:52.640]  I felt really good about the Rod Stewart thing.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.340]  You had it out.
[05:57.720 --> 06:01.060]  You had it out so much faster than I was just forming the idea.
[06:01.180 --> 06:02.820]  And it was I was started to laugh.
[06:02.920 --> 06:04.240]  That's not your first thought.
[06:04.300 --> 06:04.700]  What do you hear?
[06:04.740 --> 06:05.380]  Stomach pump.
[06:06.380 --> 06:08.540]  Yeah, I just wasn't that fast on the update.
[06:08.780 --> 06:10.780]  He said stomach pump minutes ago.
[06:10.820 --> 06:13.640]  And I'm like, all right, we got to we got to walk this road for a little while before
[06:13.640 --> 06:14.500]  I get this one out.
[06:16.760 --> 06:17.560]  Jesus Christ.
[06:19.080 --> 06:23.360]  Apparently, just really common in England, you know, for you drinking too much of anything.
[06:24.220 --> 06:26.900]  Yeah, my friend, my friend, Steph, she had a few.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.260]  Yeah, well, a pint of what?
[06:30.880 --> 06:32.320]  Nine pints of huh?
[06:34.520 --> 06:35.320]  Just booze.
[06:35.320 --> 06:36.640]  Well, pints are bigger there, though.
[06:36.740 --> 06:40.880]  I would I would like to hear this would be a perfect toad in the whole situation,
[06:40.880 --> 06:45.100]  because I want somebody from where Gavin's from to just say, no, what are you talking?
[06:45.240 --> 06:48.720]  Like, it's this is something very specific to Gavin's friend group
[06:48.720 --> 06:51.980]  and is not nearly as wide as he's acting like it is.
[06:52.400 --> 06:55.920]  Well, can I invite the friends I've not spoken to in 25 years to the whole?
[06:55.940 --> 06:57.700]  I think they just validate your point.
[06:58.200 --> 06:59.560]  I mean, you can do whatever you want.
[06:59.600 --> 07:03.760]  But like, as far as somehow changing that narrative, I think like I believe
[07:04.480 --> 07:07.040]  it's not that I disagree with what you're saying.
[07:07.180 --> 07:10.040]  It's that I would just love to hear somebody else's perspective,
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.600]  not in your circle and just be like, no, this is that's horrifying.
[07:15.160 --> 07:16.380]  Yeah, they all said it so casually.
[07:16.680 --> 07:19.220]  I'd love to hear from the kid who got his stomach pumped four times,
[07:19.220 --> 07:22.820]  because in the last 20 years, you figure he's good for another five or six, right?
[07:23.500 --> 07:24.800]  He was an absolute machine.
[07:24.840 --> 07:26.700]  He could easily put away eight pints.
[07:27.080 --> 07:28.620]  It sounds like he couldn't keep them away, though.
[07:29.040 --> 07:31.640]  Yeah, I think it was the ninth and tenth that usually did him in.
[07:31.640 --> 07:37.240]  But he would easily be stood there at Waitrose on, you know, 7 a.m.,
[07:37.240 --> 07:40.600]  stacking the salad, just kind of swaying on eight pints.
[07:40.940 --> 07:43.200]  And he somehow managed to be there on time every week.
[07:43.760 --> 07:46.300]  And he had a punch card for fucking stomach pumping.
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.380]  I've never really thought about it.
[07:48.380 --> 07:49.800]  I don't know how any of this works.
[07:50.440 --> 07:52.420]  Like when I imagine someone getting stomach pumped,
[07:52.420 --> 07:56.600]  I imagine that minigame in Mario Party where you got to inflate the giant Bowser balloon.
[07:57.080 --> 07:58.800]  Like that is sort of the visual.
[07:58.800 --> 08:00.960]  Well, I don't know how...
[08:01.540 --> 08:03.040]  It's just two doctors thumping a button.
[08:03.800 --> 08:07.580]  Yeah, it's a definite thump situation in my head.
[08:08.040 --> 08:11.760]  There's like maybe one of those, you know, like foot pumps
[08:12.280 --> 08:15.880]  that is mashing their foot over and over again, getting the pump going.
[08:16.280 --> 08:20.740]  I'd love to know who is the first person that required the stomach pump.
[08:21.060 --> 08:22.340]  Probably someone who got poisoned.
[08:22.880 --> 08:23.600]  You think so?
[08:24.040 --> 08:25.740]  I guess that would make sense.
[08:25.740 --> 08:29.000]  Who was the first person to get...
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.400]  Just the idea of being like, oh, you know what we need?
[08:31.560 --> 08:32.480]  Stomach pump for this.
[08:32.840 --> 08:34.680]  Fuck, that's not invented yet.
[08:34.840 --> 08:38.060]  Well, yeah, but like it's not even it's not even crazy,
[08:38.060 --> 08:41.400]  because when you think about like how like where surgeries came from
[08:41.400 --> 08:43.760]  and like all this stuff or whatever, sometimes it's like, wow,
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.100]  how did they even get started with this?
[08:45.460 --> 08:47.640]  This is just something is in there.
[08:47.700 --> 08:48.780]  We have to get it out.
[08:49.020 --> 08:50.920]  Shove a tube down to get it.
[08:51.160 --> 08:54.400]  It was probably like turn them upside down at first.
[08:54.400 --> 08:55.920]  And then they figured out suction.
[08:56.060 --> 09:01.080]  But like that's not probably too far off from like how it started to where it is now.
[09:01.160 --> 09:04.320]  Just technology is doing the pumping instead of a guy on one end
[09:04.320 --> 09:07.740]  siphoning it out like a gas tank.
[09:08.060 --> 09:13.720]  God, would you guys like to guess what year the if anybody can guess the year?
[09:14.160 --> 09:14.760]  And you're not cheating.
[09:14.960 --> 09:15.700]  I'll give you a vinyl.
[09:16.240 --> 09:18.720]  For the year the stomach pump was invented.
[09:18.900 --> 09:20.620]  Damn, I was going to say 1810.
[09:20.840 --> 09:21.360]  God damn.
[09:21.360 --> 09:25.440]  I got an 1850 from Gavin, 1810 from Eric.
[09:25.560 --> 09:26.920]  No, mine was 15, 1815.
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.640]  I'm going to change mine to 1799.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.100]  OK, all right.
[09:32.260 --> 09:32.620]  Interesting.
[09:33.220 --> 09:33.940]  Nick and Andrew.
[09:34.380 --> 09:35.120]  Big party year.
[09:35.460 --> 09:36.100]  1910.
[09:36.480 --> 09:37.760]  I'm going to say 1905.
[09:39.100 --> 09:40.980]  Gavin was the closest.
[09:42.120 --> 09:48.400]  Alexander Monroe, a Scottish physician, invented the stomach pump in 1767.
[09:49.180 --> 09:49.700]  Wow.
[09:49.700 --> 09:52.980]  OK, so Gavin wasn't the closest.
[09:53.360 --> 09:54.060]  Oh, sorry.
[09:54.160 --> 09:54.900]  Eric was the closest.
[09:55.020 --> 09:55.400]  Whoever said...
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.440]  Hey, you guys are right neck and neck.
[09:58.680 --> 09:59.480]  You know what?
[09:59.640 --> 10:00.000]  You know what?
[10:00.060 --> 10:01.480]  Closest doesn't get you a vinyl.
[10:01.680 --> 10:02.680]  Only Zach, so...
[10:02.680 --> 10:03.680]  Jesus Christ.
[10:04.320 --> 10:04.820]  Oh, man.
[10:05.100 --> 10:06.760]  Nick, did you say 1910?
[10:07.400 --> 10:07.760]  Yeah!
[10:11.780 --> 10:13.420]  Well, there's the thumbnail for this week.
[10:15.180 --> 10:16.640]  Visual of a stomach pump.
[10:17.260 --> 10:17.700]  Horrifying.
[10:17.700 --> 10:19.000]  You think this...
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.040]  You think the stomach pump didn't exist during Red Dead Redemption 2?
[10:25.900 --> 10:26.420]  What?
[10:28.460 --> 10:29.420]  Seems recent.
[10:29.740 --> 10:32.580]  You think the stomach pump didn't exist during Expedition 33?
[10:35.420 --> 10:39.160]  I hope they didn't keep that thing in the same drawer as the horse inseminator.
[10:40.140 --> 10:41.040]  Oh, no.
[10:41.560 --> 10:42.060]  Pretty damn close.
[10:44.020 --> 10:46.600]  And, you know, they didn't know about washing shit back then either.
[10:49.260 --> 10:49.780]  I...
[10:49.780 --> 10:55.820]  Speaking of old surgery stuff, there is no thing less created for me than the show The Nick.
[10:56.420 --> 11:01.360]  As somebody who struggles with surgery stuff like that is...
[11:01.360 --> 11:02.940]  I hear it's fantastic.
[11:03.200 --> 11:04.320]  I can never watch it.
[11:04.820 --> 11:05.080]  Impossible.
[11:05.120 --> 11:07.060]  Dude, I got a worse one for you.
[11:07.180 --> 11:10.380]  My wife watches this show, The Pit.
[11:10.980 --> 11:11.700]  Fuck me.
[11:11.800 --> 11:16.880]  That is the grossest, most gore filled show I've ever seen in my entire life.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.360]  It's like Eli Roth directs every episode.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.260]  Oh, Jesus.
[11:21.420 --> 11:22.640]  I don't like that.
[11:23.220 --> 11:26.800]  I don't like... I enjoy... you know, but that's good TikTok content.
[11:27.180 --> 11:33.880]  I want to see the TikTok of the guy stuck in cement that they can't fix for exactly 45 seconds.
[11:34.200 --> 11:35.320]  And then I'm good.
[11:35.780 --> 11:36.580]  That's all I need.
[11:36.940 --> 11:40.620]  I've only seen The Pit on TikTok, so it is great TikTok content.
[11:41.080 --> 11:42.420]  That's fake ER, right?
[11:42.660 --> 11:43.020]  The Pit?
[11:43.540 --> 11:44.180]  Yes, it is.
[11:44.240 --> 11:46.320]  Yeah, it's like the spiritual successor to ER.
[11:46.320 --> 11:49.280]  Michael Crichton's estate is furious, but it's so upset.
[11:49.600 --> 11:50.480]  Yeah, HBO is doing well.
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.600]  Were you bummed, Andrew, that you didn't come close to passing out in the autopsy simulator video?
[11:55.960 --> 11:56.840]  I was pretty tingly.
[11:57.180 --> 12:02.700]  Like it wasn't... I didn't have symptoms, but I had... I got enough out of it to not be disappointed.
[12:03.320 --> 12:06.140]  It'd be funnier if it was worse, but like I was happy.
[12:06.740 --> 12:09.980]  Well, happy maybe isn't the right word, but I was glad that...
[12:09.980 --> 12:12.240]  How much further would you take it or is that it?
[12:12.540 --> 12:13.540]  Oh no, I'd love to do it again.
[12:13.700 --> 12:15.120]  We just haven't had time on schedule.
[12:15.120 --> 12:16.280]  I'd love to do another part.
[12:16.680 --> 12:17.880]  I want to see what's going on there.
[12:18.000 --> 12:18.780]  Ghosts or something?
[12:19.280 --> 12:19.780]  I don't know.
[12:20.380 --> 12:22.140]  You guys couldn't hear the audio when we did it?
[12:22.240 --> 12:23.120]  Got demonetized there.
[12:23.600 --> 12:24.140]  I don't care.
[12:24.860 --> 12:25.260]  Whatever.
[12:27.600 --> 12:28.740]  Gotta get those bodies.
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.560]  We gotta open them up.
[12:30.900 --> 12:31.820]  Yeah, see what's inside.
[12:33.120 --> 12:33.820]  There's a spirit.
[12:33.960 --> 12:36.720]  Geoff, we played a surgery game and we think there's a ghost.
[12:37.440 --> 12:38.420]  It's tough to read.
[12:38.820 --> 12:42.940]  I watched probably like seven or eight minutes of it and I was confused because I was bouncing
[12:42.940 --> 12:46.220]  around and you'd just be like doing a normal autopsy and then there'd be a cutscene of
[12:46.220 --> 12:48.420]  skulls or something and then it was weird.
[12:49.300 --> 12:54.860]  Yeah, it's a game I'm excited to play more of, but surgery stuff.
[12:55.900 --> 12:56.260]  No thanks.
[12:57.240 --> 13:02.700]  Hey, speaking of games, should we mention that we had a bit of a milestone yesterday?
[13:03.900 --> 13:07.060]  We went into the office and I know it's so weird, right?
[13:07.060 --> 13:08.260]  Because we record a little bit ahead.
[13:08.260 --> 13:13.160]  So it's been weeks since we have had an office at this point.
[13:13.180 --> 13:18.000]  But in the real, in our recording time, it's only been about a week since we did the stream.
[13:18.540 --> 13:24.860]  And so we went in yesterday and we recorded our first gameplay from the computers in the office
[13:24.860 --> 13:26.740]  and fucked it up.
[13:26.800 --> 13:27.880]  But it was fun.
[13:28.880 --> 13:29.900]  It looked fun.
[13:31.180 --> 13:33.420]  Yeah, it just didn't sound fun.
[13:33.420 --> 13:36.040]  Uh, yeah, we learned some stuff.
[13:36.140 --> 13:40.820]  Got some, got some audio channels to fix and reroute.
[13:41.080 --> 13:43.600]  But other than that, I think, I think we're in business.
[13:43.660 --> 13:47.980]  Also, we finished filming or we filmed the next part of the Gumpler saga,
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.900]  which I'm really excited about the audience getting to see.
[13:51.200 --> 13:54.600]  That's one thing I'm enjoying about the new office is that we're already into sagas,
[13:54.680 --> 13:55.860]  where it's like, oh, this didn't work.
[13:56.220 --> 13:58.040]  But, you know, we're not done yet, we'll add to it.
[13:58.060 --> 13:59.960]  Let's not spoil too much of the videos here.
[13:59.960 --> 14:05.020]  Yeah, we've decided there'll be more Gumpler videos for sure.
[14:06.380 --> 14:11.840]  I was sad to have missed everything, but I was in the dentist and it brought me joy
[14:11.840 --> 14:16.940]  while laying in the chair in pain, knowing that you guys were in an office in Austin
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.020]  figuring out how the Gumpler works.
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.440]  I was very happy.
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.700]  That was the one thing I had going for me.
[14:23.980 --> 14:24.760]  Oh, man.
[14:24.860 --> 14:28.240]  It was sad looking over to the dead eyes of the little robot.
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.060]  Yeah, how are you?
[14:32.140 --> 14:33.020]  How are you doing, Andrew?
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.340]  You were feeling pretty rough yesterday when we were talking.
[14:35.640 --> 14:36.840]  What would you say?
[14:36.880 --> 14:37.940]  You're like no pain today.
[14:38.020 --> 14:38.460]  You're totally fine.
[14:38.600 --> 14:38.780]  No pain.
[14:38.980 --> 14:39.540]  Totally good.
[14:40.020 --> 14:42.360]  It's funny because I came when I got home.
[14:42.440 --> 14:43.380]  I came back home.
[14:43.460 --> 14:45.060]  I realized just leaving.
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.500]  I came by itself.
[14:46.760 --> 14:47.360]  Terrible idea.
[14:47.580 --> 14:52.040]  When I came home, I opened the thing to be like, oh, I wonder if they're still there.
[14:52.060 --> 14:52.740]  What's going on?
[14:52.740 --> 14:55.100]  And you guys were just starting your test.
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.600]  And I really wanted to roll in and just be like, ah, but I was I was too.
[15:00.740 --> 15:01.200]  I was out.
[15:01.400 --> 15:01.880]  I was done.
[15:02.320 --> 15:03.580]  That just took a lot out of me.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.160]  Did not have the energy for it, but I popped out later.
[15:06.540 --> 15:08.460]  Like emotionally or physically.
[15:08.460 --> 15:10.540]  Did he take a lot of teeth out of you?
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.720]  Emotionally and also just like I my half my face was numb.
[15:16.920 --> 15:22.940]  So just like rolling up and really wasn't just didn't have it in me in that moment.
[15:22.940 --> 15:26.800]  And plus, you guys all had headphones on and there is nothing I thought would be more
[15:26.800 --> 15:28.840]  disappointing than to go through it.
[15:28.860 --> 15:30.660]  And you guys not notice at all.
[15:31.180 --> 15:33.440]  So I was like, it's just not it's not worth it.
[15:33.460 --> 15:34.120]  I'll come back later.
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.280]  I'll recover a little bit.
[15:35.340 --> 15:38.940]  When you texted that you were at the dentist and in pain, I almost cried.
[15:39.060 --> 15:40.460]  I have such dental anxiety.
[15:40.740 --> 15:42.360]  I'm transferring it to other people now.
[15:42.640 --> 15:46.260]  And I felt so all I could think about last night was you in the dentist.
[15:46.620 --> 15:48.020]  I'm so glad you're feeling better today.
[15:48.160 --> 15:52.520]  I learned that apparently if you have like a tooth crack, they can't easily detect it.
[15:52.520 --> 15:53.880]  Via their X-rays.
[15:54.320 --> 15:55.800]  So you got to vocalize it.
[15:55.940 --> 15:56.680]  Which I'm glad I did.
[15:56.940 --> 15:57.140]  Really?
[15:57.740 --> 16:03.300]  I guess like the perspective in which cracks usually occur and the like angle that they
[16:03.300 --> 16:04.520]  get, like it lines up.
[16:04.600 --> 16:07.040]  So it's hard to tell if there's a crack in it.
[16:07.140 --> 16:09.160]  Like the tooth will visually look fine.
[16:09.240 --> 16:10.900]  But obviously, upon inspection.
[16:11.240 --> 16:12.240]  So you knew it was cracked, though?
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.480]  Yeah, I had a feeling because I had I had cracked it two days before I had an appointment for
[16:18.480 --> 16:19.180]  something else.
[16:20.200 --> 16:24.680]  And I thought, oh, maybe, you know, like I just ate something the wrong way, like I
[16:24.680 --> 16:27.240]  jammed in my gum or something and then I could feel my tongue.
[16:27.320 --> 16:29.380]  And I was like, I think that's I think I split.
[16:30.100 --> 16:30.860]  That's not great.
[16:30.960 --> 16:31.100]  Yeah.
[16:31.620 --> 16:34.740]  So then, yeah, I had to go in and they're like, OK, so we're going to do this.
[16:34.820 --> 16:36.700]  And I had to go, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16:36.800 --> 16:37.460]  One second.
[16:38.200 --> 16:40.440]  I have a I think I have a crack.
[16:40.900 --> 16:42.340]  And they're like, oh, this tooth.
[16:42.420 --> 16:43.720]  And I said, no, that that one.
[16:44.000 --> 16:45.820]  That's what I was supposed to come here to work on.
[16:45.820 --> 16:48.080]  And I said, the one next to it.
[16:48.300 --> 16:49.660]  And they went, oh, this one.
[16:49.760 --> 16:50.960]  And it hurts so much.
[16:51.380 --> 16:52.840]  They like put their fingers out.
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.640]  They're like, OK, yeah, it's that one.
[16:55.080 --> 16:56.020]  Let's figure this out.
[16:57.600 --> 16:58.880]  How long were you there for?
[16:59.740 --> 17:01.860]  Uh, a little over two hours.
[17:02.800 --> 17:03.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:03.560 --> 17:05.680]  That felt like about a two hour one, as you were describing it.
[17:05.720 --> 17:06.220]  That sucks.
[17:06.400 --> 17:06.720]  Yeah.
[17:06.940 --> 17:08.380]  Oh, the only positive.
[17:08.500 --> 17:12.560]  What's nice about those experiences is I've never had a tooth crack, but not like fully
[17:13.100 --> 17:15.020]  detached from the rest of the tooth.
[17:15.020 --> 17:18.940]  So when they said, like, OK, we got to extract this cracked part.
[17:18.980 --> 17:21.980]  I was like, oh, boy, that's that could be bad.
[17:23.160 --> 17:27.300]  And they pulled it without me even realizing the the process had begun.
[17:27.700 --> 17:32.020]  He like did the numbing stuff and then they went in and I was like, OK, I guess you're
[17:32.020 --> 17:33.680]  like kind of going to size this up.
[17:33.820 --> 17:36.760]  And then they said, OK, so we've extracted the crack part.
[17:36.980 --> 17:38.720]  And I was like, oh, that is great.
[17:39.160 --> 17:39.520]  Fantastic.
[17:39.640 --> 17:40.680]  I was kind of worried about that.
[17:40.840 --> 17:41.960]  Not a lot of resistance there.
[17:42.520 --> 17:45.180]  Yeah, this instantly, instantly gone.
[17:45.420 --> 17:47.020]  It's overall good.
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.080]  Feel a lot better today.
[17:49.040 --> 17:50.220]  Excited to be doing stuff.
[17:50.580 --> 17:52.060]  I was glad to hear that.
[17:52.940 --> 17:53.900]  I missed it.
[17:54.120 --> 17:54.820]  You sound great today.
[17:55.300 --> 17:59.740]  I was also happy that Gavin got good kip, which is a word he used.
[17:59.780 --> 18:04.400]  I think it's the first time Gavin's ever said anything to me that I then had to Google to
[18:04.400 --> 18:05.880]  try to figure out what it meant.
[18:06.880 --> 18:07.280]  Oh, really?
[18:07.440 --> 18:07.880]  Oh, sorry.
[18:07.960 --> 18:08.920]  Kip is nap, right?
[18:09.460 --> 18:10.340]  Yeah, it's like sleep.
[18:10.480 --> 18:11.520]  It's like good quality sleep.
[18:11.520 --> 18:13.320]  I appreciate it.
[18:13.680 --> 18:14.260]  It's a good word.
[18:14.340 --> 18:14.920]  Got some good kip.
[18:15.300 --> 18:15.880]  I like kip.
[18:16.280 --> 18:17.180]  Are you going to start using it?
[18:17.580 --> 18:18.220]  I think I will.
[18:18.320 --> 18:23.920]  For some reason, my head, it resonates is like dog food is the imagery I imagine when I hear kip.
[18:24.220 --> 18:25.200]  Like, like kibble?
[18:25.540 --> 18:28.040]  Yeah, like kibble, like some dry ass dog food.
[18:29.320 --> 18:30.540]  But I like the term.
[18:30.720 --> 18:32.220]  Well, that's what my throat feels like.
[18:33.040 --> 18:33.780]  Dog food.
[18:34.980 --> 18:36.160]  Dry ass dog food.
[18:36.420 --> 18:37.480]  Try and get some kip in there.
[18:37.640 --> 18:38.020]  Oh, Christ.
[18:38.500 --> 18:39.000]  Kip it out.
[18:39.760 --> 18:46.280]  I looked at my file from the test yesterday and I noticed that my audio was there and
[18:46.280 --> 18:47.840]  everyone's audio was in it.
[18:48.080 --> 18:52.420]  And I thought, oh, well, you know, Nick was in a rush when he when he set up my routing
[18:52.420 --> 18:54.500]  through the GoXLR and all that stuff.
[18:54.620 --> 18:58.340]  And then I listened to someone else's audio and everything was there.
[18:58.420 --> 19:02.920]  And I listened to everyone's audio and everyone's audio was on everyone's file.
[19:03.400 --> 19:04.620]  I appreciate that, though.
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.800]  We're not losing any audio at that point.
[19:06.800 --> 19:08.680]  We got so much coverage.
[19:10.180 --> 19:12.180]  Everyone has everyone's backups.
[19:13.300 --> 19:17.700]  We established that it was it was a test, so it's very low stakes blame.
[19:17.900 --> 19:21.380]  But I feel like Nick really messed it all up.
[19:21.560 --> 19:22.840]  It sounds like you really want to sign blame.
[19:22.960 --> 19:24.240]  Nick, defend yourself.
[19:24.440 --> 19:25.760]  Gavin kept taking my mouse.
[19:26.580 --> 19:33.280]  Gavin did keep taking his mouse, which I will say has nothing to do with how we ended up
[19:33.280 --> 19:35.420]  with all the audio on all the tracks.
[19:35.580 --> 19:38.500]  But that is something that did happen.
[19:38.780 --> 19:40.920]  But I couldn't monitor my audio as a result.
[19:41.580 --> 19:43.000]  Well, there we go.
[19:43.240 --> 19:44.160]  Suck on that, Eric.
[19:44.360 --> 19:45.280]  That's a great defense there.
[19:45.380 --> 19:47.540]  I thought, Nick, you were just doing the classic routine of
[19:47.540 --> 19:48.880]  you're going to say something I did wrong.
[19:48.960 --> 19:50.220]  I'm going to say something you did wrong.
[19:50.360 --> 19:51.700]  Now we're both equally wrong.
[19:51.840 --> 19:55.320]  But there's a whole logic behind what you just did.
[19:55.760 --> 19:56.880]  He couldn't monitor his audio.
[19:57.180 --> 19:58.120]  Eric ordered three mice.
[19:58.120 --> 20:02.860]  You can only order three mice at a time on Amazon.
[20:02.940 --> 20:05.460]  And it goes, hey, you want to order more mice?
[20:05.560 --> 20:07.340]  You actually can't do that.
[20:07.400 --> 20:11.080]  And I think Geoff had the same problem with Xboxes.
[20:11.460 --> 20:15.800]  And Xboxes and mice are not the same because one is $30.
[20:17.200 --> 20:18.740]  Give me 10 mice.
[20:18.920 --> 20:19.400]  Who cares?
[20:19.740 --> 20:23.780]  Oddly, it let me buy five capture cards all at once the other day.
[20:23.980 --> 20:24.840]  No problem at all.
[20:24.940 --> 20:27.460]  How are you going to use those without your mice and your Xboxes?
[20:28.460 --> 20:30.200]  Could be like a three blind mice rule.
[20:30.740 --> 20:32.000]  There's no four blind mice.
[20:32.580 --> 20:33.580]  Okay, okay.
[20:36.460 --> 20:37.540]  Can't go but three.
[20:40.400 --> 20:41.280]  What the...
[20:41.280 --> 20:45.000]  The three blind mice rule.
[20:45.260 --> 20:46.040]  Well, they don't got eyes.
[20:47.480 --> 20:50.860]  Amazon, if they can't see, if they don't have eyes on what you're using the mice for,
[20:50.920 --> 20:51.820]  they're going to limit you to three.
[20:53.620 --> 20:56.580]  When you're starting a business, it's insanely stressful.
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.960]  Feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once.
[20:59.160 --> 21:01.020]  And as you proceed, they only multiply.
[21:01.560 --> 21:04.260]  It's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service like Shopify.
[21:04.920 --> 21:07.380]  Shopify, in my opinion, is the best of what it does.
[21:07.500 --> 21:11.720]  And knowing that we will have all of the support and tools it provides is the best feeling.

[21:15.280 --> 21:18.360]  and 10% of all e-commerce in the US.

[21:35.360 --> 21:38.840]  Shopify is loaded with helpful AI tools allowing you to accelerate the process
[21:38.840 --> 21:44.020]  of things like product descriptions, page headlines, and even enhance your product photography.
[21:44.540 --> 21:47.680]  Shopify allows you to easily create email and social media campaigns.

[22:02.220 --> 22:04.140]  As a business owner who uses Shopify,
[22:04.560 --> 22:06.940]  I don't want to imagine navigating those things without it.
[22:07.240 --> 22:09.560]  If you're ready to sell, you're ready for Shopify.
[22:10.180 --> 22:12.920]  What I love about Shopify is no matter how big you want to grow,

[22:17.980 --> 22:19.720]  Or even if you're happy with the level you're at,

[22:41.720 --> 22:43.920]  Well, summer's officially here.
[22:44.060 --> 22:44.800]  You know what that means.
[22:44.800 --> 22:51.020]  More sun, more sunlight, more time to do all the things outside that make summer
[22:51.020 --> 22:54.840]  so special and make living in cold climates during the winter worth it.
[22:55.180 --> 22:58.160]  And the number one thing you don't want to do this summer,
[22:58.560 --> 23:01.180]  spend all day in the kitchen cooking.

[23:52.460 --> 23:53.960]  You don't need to be in the kitchen.

[24:34.980 --> 24:40.040]  The cool thing about The Office, if we're still talking about it a little bit, is Gavin
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.220]  has done some technical wizardry where our download speed and upload speed is out of
[24:46.220 --> 24:46.700]  control.
[24:46.840 --> 24:51.260]  It's so... we downloaded Grand Theft Auto in like four minutes.
[24:51.520 --> 24:54.840]  It took so long to install, but the download was so fast.
[24:54.900 --> 24:56.280]  It was like... it made my head spin.
[24:56.380 --> 24:57.400]  It was maxed.
[24:57.600 --> 25:00.720]  Like 980 down, 980 megs down or so.
[25:00.720 --> 25:02.320]  It's less to do with anything I did.
[25:02.400 --> 25:04.220]  It was just more about the internet that you ordered.
[25:05.160 --> 25:09.260]  Well, when I ordered the internet, the guy was like, why do you need this much speed?
[25:09.380 --> 25:11.960]  And I went, oh, we're going to be like doing business out of here or whatever.
[25:11.980 --> 25:12.760]  And he's like, okay.
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.080]  I mean, usually I just tell my customers, you probably don't need this much.
[25:16.140 --> 25:19.400]  And I went, I appreciate it, but we do.
[25:19.780 --> 25:20.740]  So we'll take it.
[25:20.840 --> 25:25.660]  This guy's never had four people downloading GTA all at a gigabit at the same time.
[25:26.060 --> 25:26.420]  Right.
[25:26.460 --> 25:30.280]  And then he's also... he's also never had them all record their audio on one track.
[25:30.800 --> 25:32.020]  One place for a test.
[25:32.120 --> 25:33.900]  But that's here, neither here nor there.
[25:34.380 --> 25:37.020]  We were playing like four gigabits just on GTA yesterday.
[25:37.880 --> 25:39.720]  Gavin says it has nothing to do with him.
[25:39.820 --> 25:42.340]  But the second the internet got installed, he went in,
[25:42.700 --> 25:45.280]  uninstalled the modem and the router that they gave us,
[25:45.560 --> 25:49.380]  put his own in, brought in some sort of a rack system with
[25:50.760 --> 25:54.100]  green and blue lights going that indicate things that I don't understand.
[25:54.400 --> 25:56.320]  That's way more complicated than anything I've ever seen.
[25:56.460 --> 25:58.720]  He's got ethernet cables running to our...
[25:59.320 --> 26:02.840]  the system where these cables... it's the smallest cable I've ever seen in my entire life.
[26:02.940 --> 26:06.200]  It's thinner than like an iPhone head headphone cable.
[26:06.820 --> 26:10.140]  And I don't recognize any of the technology that Gavin used.
[26:10.280 --> 26:14.840]  And there's no way it's not all on Google.
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.140]  Gavin, you did some work there.
[26:16.480 --> 26:17.140]  Yeah, just some research.
[26:17.300 --> 26:20.020]  It's actually the same sort of stuff that we had at Rooster Teeth.
[26:20.340 --> 26:24.140]  But it just means that we can remotely fix problems without having to go there.
[26:24.580 --> 26:26.640]  Also, our internet was never that good at Rooster Teeth.
[26:26.640 --> 26:31.620]  Oh no, it was all like limited and... we're unlimited here at our office.
[26:32.040 --> 26:34.840]  And now we have a place to put all of our files.
[26:35.040 --> 26:37.820]  So like it doesn't even... it makes even less sense for you to have strikes now, right?
[26:38.280 --> 26:43.380]  Well, I was going to say, that was maybe the best laugh I had yesterday.
[26:43.740 --> 26:47.520]  Unexpected laugh was Gavin in the Slack posted a giant thing
[26:47.520 --> 26:49.300]  about how he optimized uploading.
[26:49.860 --> 26:53.340]  And of all the people to optimize uploading, that was hilarious.
[26:56.640 --> 26:58.220]  That made me really happy.
[26:59.140 --> 27:02.940]  I read this very technical long thing of like,
[27:02.980 --> 27:04.780]  yeah, now we can upload from home and it's great.
[27:04.900 --> 27:06.960]  And it's like, OK, we upload it all.
[27:07.400 --> 27:09.720]  But first, let's just get in a basic upload going.
[27:11.680 --> 27:14.240]  The next phase of it is I'm going to set everyone's
[27:14.240 --> 27:17.120]  capture folder to be like watch folders for the raid.
[27:17.180 --> 27:20.700]  So it just sucks everything onto it without you having to press anything.
[27:21.240 --> 27:21.680]  Crazy.
[27:23.480 --> 27:28.420]  I am imagining with everybody's track, everyone having everything in every track.
[27:28.700 --> 27:33.020]  I think it's always so cool when somebody deconstructs a song,
[27:33.060 --> 27:35.400]  like a music producer, like only plays the drums.
[27:35.820 --> 27:38.280]  That would not translate to what you guys just did.
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.840]  Just listening to like Gavin's track and be like, OK,
[27:41.880 --> 27:43.700]  now let's just let's just zone in on this.
[27:43.760 --> 27:44.800]  Let's see what's going on here.
[27:44.880 --> 27:46.040]  Isolate it, isolate Gavin.
[27:46.300 --> 27:47.160]  Let's isolate this.
[27:47.960 --> 27:50.880]  It really doesn't add anything to that setup.
[27:51.540 --> 27:52.840]  The same way with music.
[27:53.160 --> 27:54.460]  I think that's so cool.
[27:54.980 --> 27:58.440]  Anytime there is isolation of a song, especially with like
[27:58.440 --> 28:02.860]  hip hop of like learning what the the tracks are being pulled from.
[28:02.940 --> 28:03.740]  It's awesome.
[28:04.240 --> 28:05.300]  Doesn't apply to Lost Place.
[28:05.840 --> 28:10.580]  There was that documentary series that Rick Rubin did with Paul McCartney,
[28:10.720 --> 28:14.720]  where he isolated tracks and instruments and stuff on Beatles songs.
[28:14.720 --> 28:17.380]  And it was it was the wildest thing I've ever heard.
[28:17.460 --> 28:18.320]  It was really fascinating.
[28:18.700 --> 28:21.060]  Definitely wouldn't get that from anything we do.
[28:21.640 --> 28:25.520]  I wonder if you could tell what video game was being played.
[28:25.880 --> 28:27.420]  How long that would...
[28:27.420 --> 28:29.400]  Maybe that's like a competition we could do at some point,
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.200]  where it's games that we've all played and then how long it takes
[28:32.620 --> 28:34.840]  each of us to register what that game is.
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.520]  And if it's accurate.
[28:36.620 --> 28:39.420]  Or maybe we do like a blind Let's Play someday where the
[28:40.060 --> 28:42.600]  it's just audio and we don't say what the game is
[28:42.600 --> 28:44.260]  and the audience has to figure it out.
[28:44.260 --> 28:45.840]  And if they get it right, we'll give them something.
[28:46.100 --> 28:47.280]  We'll let the audience do the work.
[28:47.600 --> 28:47.760]  Yeah.
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.160]  But Gavin and I were talking about this recently of that humans are
[28:54.200 --> 28:58.980]  terrible at recognizing what things sound like based on movies and TV.
[28:59.680 --> 29:03.500]  Like, I feel like I'll see like a horse walking in a show
[29:03.500 --> 29:05.220]  and then you'll see what they used.
[29:05.240 --> 29:08.160]  And it's like cabbage pushed against the garbage can lid.
[29:08.280 --> 29:11.280]  Like nothing sounds like it should.
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.360]  Like the ability to recognize what these things actually are.
[29:15.820 --> 29:17.560]  It'd be fun for us maybe to do that.
[29:17.640 --> 29:19.660]  Maybe do our own sound effect type work.
[29:19.920 --> 29:21.200]  Our own Foley work.
[29:21.460 --> 29:22.580]  Our own Foley work.
[29:24.360 --> 29:27.080]  I want to see a show where a guy walks out of a saloon
[29:27.080 --> 29:28.940]  and hops onto some cabbage and...
[29:30.940 --> 29:33.260]  Well, the sound they use for him hopping on cabbage,
[29:33.360 --> 29:35.800]  actually cactus getting hit by baseball bats.
[29:37.360 --> 29:38.240]  Completely different.
[29:41.460 --> 29:44.060]  I had a weird thought the other night.
[29:44.440 --> 29:45.140]  But do you think...
[29:45.720 --> 29:46.280]  Yeah, in bed.
[29:46.460 --> 29:47.680]  It was specifically in bed.
[29:47.740 --> 29:48.340]  It was a bed thought.
[29:48.940 --> 29:53.120]  I was thinking if somebody stole your cheeks while you're sleeping,
[29:53.480 --> 29:54.000]  your butt cheeks,
[29:54.760 --> 29:56.660]  how long do you think it would take for you to nut?
[29:58.220 --> 29:58.660]  Instantly.
[29:59.200 --> 29:59.640]  Really?
[30:00.320 --> 30:00.760]  Instantly.
[30:01.100 --> 30:03.680]  You'd roll over onto your butt and it'd be gone.
[30:03.840 --> 30:04.380]  No, no, no, no.
[30:04.400 --> 30:05.220]  You'd instantly wake up.
[30:05.280 --> 30:06.340]  The Indiana Jones it.
[30:06.660 --> 30:09.660]  So they steal your cheeks, put other cheeks in.
[30:10.160 --> 30:11.640]  I don't think I would notice.
[30:11.860 --> 30:12.600]  Wait, you're talking about your face?
[30:13.040 --> 30:13.840]  No, butt cheeks.
[30:14.440 --> 30:17.120]  Face cheeks I would notice because I see my face regularly.
[30:17.680 --> 30:19.840]  I was thinking about how rarely I look at my butt
[30:19.840 --> 30:22.560]  and I don't think I notice a feel difference.
[30:23.240 --> 30:25.900]  If somebody like kind of tried to Indiana Jones it,
[30:26.020 --> 30:28.140]  like obviously if it was completely different,
[30:28.260 --> 30:29.540]  then I think I would notice.
[30:29.780 --> 30:32.080]  But if it was relatively the same...
[30:32.080 --> 30:34.040]  I noticed my butt way before my face.
[30:34.340 --> 30:34.880]  You shitting me?
[30:35.240 --> 30:35.500]  Really?
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.940]  Yeah, I sit down more than I look in the mirror.
[30:37.940 --> 30:39.940]  Yeah, but you've got new butt cheeks.
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.680]  They're just different butt cheeks.
[30:42.360 --> 30:47.260]  I don't think like the butt cheek experience changes all that much.
[30:47.420 --> 30:49.640]  I think the second I touched my butt, I would know.
[30:49.840 --> 30:51.060]  I would know that that wasn't my butt.
[30:51.300 --> 30:53.300]  Because everyone has different firmness of butt.
[30:53.420 --> 30:54.760]  How often are you touching your butt?
[30:55.260 --> 30:58.460]  I mean, I don't know, at least once a day.
[30:59.180 --> 31:00.340]  I guess. Yeah, I guess.
[31:00.560 --> 31:05.900]  But I feel like there's so much other stuff going on with like a wiping situation.
[31:05.900 --> 31:08.140]  Like I'm just sitting on my butt right now.
[31:08.480 --> 31:11.940]  And I'm aware of my butt and all kinds of stuff about my butt.
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.060]  But I just don't think it would be that different.
[31:14.160 --> 31:17.340]  If I sat anywhere too long and thought about it, I'd be like, well, the seat's uncomfortable.
[31:17.740 --> 31:18.960]  Why does the seat feel weird?
[31:19.060 --> 31:20.100]  It feels different than it did yesterday.
[31:20.300 --> 31:22.040]  And I, well, everything's a little different.
[31:22.120 --> 31:24.960]  And then you start touching and you're like, holy shit, this is somebody else's ass.
[31:25.300 --> 31:27.360]  I know my butt in so many different ways.
[31:27.360 --> 31:29.340]  Like I know its level of cushioning.
[31:29.380 --> 31:30.420]  I know how it clenches.
[31:30.860 --> 31:34.780]  I feel like if I was to like swap butts with Nick, I would be able to know immediately.
[31:34.780 --> 31:37.120]  Because Nick's somebody who does way more exercise.
[31:37.920 --> 31:38.320]  Interesting.
[31:38.460 --> 31:41.160]  Yeah. Plus like the second I took a dump, I'd know.
[31:42.600 --> 31:43.480]  I, yeah.
[31:43.640 --> 31:46.540]  If you poop through a different butt, you're going to know.
[31:46.580 --> 31:48.980]  And I spent a lot of time on the toilet doing that, you know?
[31:50.180 --> 31:51.740]  But the anus would be the same.
[31:52.080 --> 31:55.100]  Yeah. I don't think it would be as different as you feel.
[31:55.180 --> 31:56.720]  Yeah. But the vessel's different, man.
[31:56.760 --> 32:00.340]  The thing you're sitting on, it's going to, there's going to be subtle differences.
[32:00.740 --> 32:04.600]  And the toilet is an exacting and harsh thing to sit on.
[32:04.600 --> 32:06.300]  You're going to feel the difference immediately.
[32:06.460 --> 32:08.800]  It would have like a different, different sleep number.
[32:09.480 --> 32:10.020]  Yeah, exactly.
[32:10.160 --> 32:10.660]  You think so?
[32:10.740 --> 32:11.920]  Your butt would have a different sleep number.
[32:12.340 --> 32:15.960]  That's the problem. I've never, I've never sat with another man's cheeks,
[32:16.020 --> 32:20.480]  but I feel like the experience is probably pretty similar.
[32:21.160 --> 32:23.360]  I don't think there's a wide range of feeling.
[32:23.700 --> 32:27.020]  I think maybe size and shape, there could be a difference.
[32:27.080 --> 32:31.520]  But as far as like sitting, I imagine sitting is kind of a universal feeling.
[32:32.020 --> 32:32.980]  I could be wrong.
[32:32.980 --> 32:37.000]  If you swap with someone who had a different sized butt, it would feel different.
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.220]  I guess.
[32:38.660 --> 32:42.000]  I also just think that like even the angle of your sit would be different
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.900]  because the butt would be subtly different.
[32:44.060 --> 32:46.300]  There'd be, you'd be, you'd feel like you're on the piss all the time.
[32:46.400 --> 32:48.560]  Like everything would just be a little askew, you know?
[32:48.940 --> 32:51.500]  Like it wouldn't, it wouldn't quite fit in the same way.
[32:51.840 --> 32:55.120]  Maybe this is a specific to me issue.
[32:55.440 --> 32:59.620]  Because I think I would just realize, like things would be slightly off.
[32:59.760 --> 33:01.860]  And then I just, I wouldn't really flag it.
[33:01.860 --> 33:04.900]  But I would start adjusting and then I'd just have a new way to sit.
[33:05.160 --> 33:06.840]  And I would have gone unnoticed.
[33:07.540 --> 33:11.380]  So you would just sit differently before you investigated your butt any further.
[33:11.560 --> 33:12.960]  And think maybe I've got a different butt.
[33:13.540 --> 33:13.840]  Yes.
[33:15.560 --> 33:19.780]  My initial response to a problem typically is let's solve this problem.
[33:20.020 --> 33:22.040]  And not necessarily what's the cause of it.
[33:22.500 --> 33:23.500]  I think I'd solve it.
[33:23.780 --> 33:25.160]  Then I would move on.
[33:25.440 --> 33:28.580]  And then maybe like a calendar year later, somehow go,
[33:28.580 --> 33:30.700]  Oh, what happened?
[33:31.360 --> 33:32.520]  Why did this happen?
[33:33.300 --> 33:36.140]  Yeah, you're like a patch the holes kind of guy as opposed to a...
[33:36.140 --> 33:36.560]  Total, well...
[33:37.140 --> 33:38.460]  Let's figure the source of the problem.
[33:38.940 --> 33:39.580]  I get, yeah.
[33:39.780 --> 33:43.960]  Like as long as I don't, as long as this is a scenario in which the problem isn't going to get
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.800]  worse by whatever I'm patching.
[33:46.300 --> 33:51.500]  If it's a, this doesn't actually solve it, then that'll change my approach to it.
[33:51.520 --> 33:54.940]  But if it's like a thing of discomfort, then yeah, I'd just adjust.
[33:55.300 --> 33:56.340]  I wouldn't think about it.
[33:56.340 --> 34:00.740]  If you and I swapped butts, I would be texting you within 20 seconds being like,
[34:01.020 --> 34:02.080]  Hey, do you have my butt?
[34:02.220 --> 34:04.920]  And it sounds like you would wait at least a year before saying anything.
[34:05.540 --> 34:07.220]  I think I'd be like, I don't know.
[34:07.220 --> 34:07.620]  Do I?
[34:08.760 --> 34:09.540]  I guess I do.
[34:11.500 --> 34:12.420]  I don't notice.
[34:15.420 --> 34:17.240]  Oh, I'm shitting totally differently.
[34:17.760 --> 34:18.520]  This is crazy.
[34:18.620 --> 34:19.360]  I definitely do.
[34:20.300 --> 34:21.420]  Farts would probably sound different.
[34:22.020 --> 34:23.460]  That'd probably be the weirdest thing.
[34:23.560 --> 34:24.040]  Oh my God.
[34:24.280 --> 34:24.700]  Definitely.
[34:24.700 --> 34:24.880]  Definitely.
[34:25.380 --> 34:27.460]  I guess that would maybe be the giveaway.
[34:28.320 --> 34:34.440]  I think the reason my farts are so shit is that all of my fart takes place at the anus
[34:34.440 --> 34:36.040]  and none of it takes place at the cheeks.
[34:37.120 --> 34:40.900]  Where I feel like if you've got like a, if you've got more fleshy arse,
[34:41.080 --> 34:46.180]  it's also working through the, through the cheeks to give some reverb and some,
[34:46.740 --> 34:48.340]  maybe some bass on each fart.
[34:49.820 --> 34:54.180]  I feel like the sound is diffused through multiple layers of hair with you as well.
[34:54.700 --> 34:56.520]  Oh, and there's definitely a muffled effect.
[34:57.100 --> 35:02.560]  Geoff, imagine how happy you would be if we had like Mr. Potato Head bodies where you
[35:02.560 --> 35:07.800]  just pop things in and out that you could go out and get an ass just for farting.
[35:08.220 --> 35:09.880]  The optimal fart ass.
[35:10.920 --> 35:13.520]  I would like an ass for long bicycle rides.
[35:13.640 --> 35:14.500]  That's the ass I want.
[35:14.940 --> 35:20.120]  What you just propositioned, Andrew, sounds like to me more than anyone else,
[35:20.220 --> 35:22.180]  that would be like Geoff's dream is just like,
[35:22.180 --> 35:25.180]  let me pop these ears off and get some different eyes going.
[35:25.940 --> 35:28.520]  I'm doing like crazy mouth today.
[35:28.840 --> 35:30.960]  Like I think Geoff, I think Geoff would be loving it.
[35:31.180 --> 35:31.960]  Oh yeah. Are you kidding?
[35:32.120 --> 35:35.620]  I can imagine picking up all Geoff's shit off the floor and putting it on my body
[35:35.620 --> 35:36.820]  and then just being in pain.
[35:41.160 --> 35:43.440]  What's this spying about? Oh, it hurts.
[35:47.060 --> 35:50.640]  There's a lot of pain wrapped around this 49 year old body.
[35:51.260 --> 35:55.200]  Oh, God. Hey, speaking of pain, can I tell you guys a dumb thing I did?
[35:55.460 --> 35:56.660]  Please. Yeah, yeah.
[35:56.900 --> 36:00.400]  I you guys remember a couple of years ago when I was in my smoothie era,
[36:00.400 --> 36:03.540]  I unintentionally created something called the Purple Nightmare.
[36:03.680 --> 36:06.360]  It actually made it into our f***face cookbook,
[36:06.460 --> 36:09.960]  which is still available to this day digitally on our Patreon.
[36:10.580 --> 36:14.060]  Or for free if you sign up, right? Like it's a I think it's a it's a gimme.
[36:14.600 --> 36:14.940]  That's right.
[36:15.340 --> 36:16.160]  If you're a paid member.
[36:16.380 --> 36:18.780]  Was the Purple Nightmare the one that you spilled everywhere?
[36:18.780 --> 36:21.240]  Was that the initial one or was that a different smoothie?
[36:21.860 --> 36:22.580]  No, that's the one.
[36:22.680 --> 36:25.800]  It was the smoothie that I was making for Millie that just fell out of my hands.
[36:26.020 --> 36:27.420]  And when it hit the ground, it exploded.
[36:27.720 --> 36:31.620]  And it was on the ceiling and the walls and behind the curtains.
[36:31.940 --> 36:35.280]  And on the other side of the like it went outside like a like a f***ing
[36:35.920 --> 36:37.040]  James McAvoy bullet.
[36:37.180 --> 36:39.640]  And it went outside and took a turn and came back and got splattered
[36:39.640 --> 36:41.120]  on the other side of the window somehow.
[36:41.580 --> 36:43.500]  Referencing that movie Wanted, obviously.
[36:44.040 --> 36:53.740]  And anyway, I unintentionally for 2025 updated the recipe and I was and I'm
[36:53.740 --> 36:56.400]  a little bummed about it because it is f***ing annoying.
[36:56.560 --> 37:02.240]  The other night I opened my fridge just to get a Werner's, a Diet Werner's soda.
[37:03.020 --> 37:08.000]  And when I shut the fridge, it like pushed back on me for a second and I heard a crack
[37:08.620 --> 37:10.760]  and a little and I thought that's weird.
[37:10.760 --> 37:12.080]  And I opened it back up.
[37:12.080 --> 37:13.660]  And I guess what had happened.
[37:13.800 --> 37:21.280]  See, what had happened was somehow a big canister of bacon bits got dislodged from the door.
[37:21.360 --> 37:23.200]  And it fell.
[37:23.740 --> 37:27.240]  You know, like the bacon bits that are hard and crunchy and that are like kind of like
[37:27.240 --> 37:29.900]  an impossible color of red to be real food.
[37:30.480 --> 37:31.000]  Kind of a purple.
[37:31.160 --> 37:32.260]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:32.260 --> 37:33.180]  Bacon bits, right?
[37:33.600 --> 37:34.060]  Thank you, Nick.
[37:34.420 --> 37:37.080]  And it was about three quarters full.
[37:37.220 --> 37:41.540]  And so it got when I shut the door, it fell and it landed just as such
[37:41.540 --> 37:45.460]  that the door cracked it and it exploded.
[37:46.060 --> 37:46.480]  Bacon bits.
[37:48.340 --> 37:49.380]  And it was a nightmare.
[37:50.020 --> 37:54.340]  My entire fridge was instantly covered in bacon bit glitter.
[37:55.300 --> 38:02.560]  It was unbelievably, unbelievably destructive, right?
[38:02.580 --> 38:06.200]  So I open it up and I'm just kind of looking at it and there's bacon bits all over the ground
[38:06.200 --> 38:09.040]  and I'm just like, oh, I can't fucking believe this.
[38:09.040 --> 38:13.160]  And Millie and her boyfriend and Emily are in the kitchen laughing at me.
[38:13.500 --> 38:14.620]  Going like, what happened?
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.800]  And I'm like, I don't I don't know.
[38:15.900 --> 38:16.840]  It was a bacon bit explosion.
[38:17.220 --> 38:20.480]  And so I grab a broom and I start just trying to sweep up the bacon bits off the ground
[38:20.480 --> 38:21.500]  and I put them into a pile.
[38:21.720 --> 38:24.800]  And then I look and I realize they're on every shelf, right?
[38:24.820 --> 38:28.080]  So I just start taking stuff out and putting it on the kitchen counter and cleaning out
[38:28.080 --> 38:28.480]  the shelves.
[38:28.580 --> 38:32.900]  And the worst concentration of bacon bits is obviously at the bottom, right?
[38:32.900 --> 38:33.520]  Because of gravity.
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.800]  So I go to take the bottom, like the veggie crisper out.
[38:38.980 --> 38:43.700]  And in this fucking fridge that I don't own because I rent, it does not come out.
[38:43.780 --> 38:45.260]  It's the only one that doesn't come out.
[38:46.020 --> 38:48.300]  But it's also, it's a veggie crisper, right?
[38:48.340 --> 38:49.520]  So it's clear plastic.
[38:49.660 --> 38:53.820]  So you can see right through it to the bottom and back of the fridge where all there are
[38:53.820 --> 38:55.200]  is like 1,000 bacon bits.
[38:55.320 --> 38:56.740]  It's hideous and it's disgusting.
[38:57.080 --> 38:58.620]  And I'm like fighting with it and wrestling.
[38:58.720 --> 39:00.620]  And I think like, I'll just break it and put a new one in.
[39:00.660 --> 39:01.620]  And like, I'm not going to do that.
[39:01.620 --> 39:06.440]  And then Emily or Millie or somebody said, it's too bad you don't have a way to blow
[39:06.440 --> 39:06.760]  it out.
[39:07.060 --> 39:10.220]  And I thought, oh, I do have a way to blow it out.
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.020]  And this is where I made a tactical error.
[39:14.300 --> 39:17.220]  I went into the backyard and I grabbed my leaf blower.
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.660]  Oh, come on.
[39:19.660 --> 39:21.000]  It's the first thing I thought of.
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.800]  So I stuck the leaf blower in the bottom of the, in the corner of the fridge and I ram
[39:25.800 --> 39:26.500]  jammed it, right?
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.000]  There's nothing tactical.
[39:28.220 --> 39:29.900]  There's nothing tactical about this.
[39:29.900 --> 39:36.160]  And it works, it works too well because I got hit with stinging bacon bits in the face
[39:36.160 --> 39:42.460]  and I hear Millie coughing in the background and I turn around and Millie and her boyfriend
[39:42.460 --> 39:47.160]  and Emily and the kitchen counter and the rest of the house are now covered in bacon
[39:47.160 --> 39:47.460]  bits.
[39:47.880 --> 39:54.660]  I tattooed the house with bacon bits, just from that quick little two second pump from
[39:54.660 --> 39:55.260]  the leaf blower.
[39:55.440 --> 39:59.040]  And it didn't entirely get all the bacon bits out of the fridge.
[39:59.040 --> 40:03.480]  I still had about 20 minutes of work there getting the rest of the bacon bits out of
[40:03.480 --> 40:03.640]  the fridge.
[40:03.740 --> 40:07.020]  But now, now there are just bacon bits all over my house.
[40:07.380 --> 40:11.960]  Like all day long, I step on a bacon bit or I move a pot and there's bacon bits behind
[40:11.960 --> 40:15.960]  it or there's a bacon bit on my Xbox controller in the other room.
[40:16.100 --> 40:16.720]  Like, how did that happen?
[40:17.080 --> 40:26.380]  I somehow put, I don't know, 100,000 bacon bits into play in my house, the first floor
[40:26.380 --> 40:31.900]  of my house, and realized that may be one of the dumber things I've done in the last
[40:31.900 --> 40:32.860]  decade or so.
[40:33.160 --> 40:37.760]  I bet taking the bottle and just drop kicking it in the kitchen would have made less mess.
[40:38.240 --> 40:45.460]  Yeah, I mean, it was a mess that was at least contained to the floor and the fridge until
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.620]  I brought the leaf blower in to the mix.
[40:49.920 --> 40:52.580]  Why did they suggest a blow instead of a suck?
[40:53.320 --> 40:55.900]  They did suggest a suck, maybe or a blow.
[40:56.120 --> 40:56.460]  I don't know.
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.480]  They were just like, maybe, I don't remember.
[40:58.600 --> 41:02.480]  They might have said like a, but we don't have like a, like a shop vac or anything.
[41:02.680 --> 41:04.060]  And I thought, I'll just blow it out the end.
[41:04.120 --> 41:07.400]  So, you know, like, and it was just in the heat of the bee, Gavin.
[41:08.620 --> 41:11.700]  Bee day was occurring and he just had to respond.
[41:12.360 --> 41:15.240]  This to me sounds like the greatest thing that's ever happened to Albert.
[41:15.900 --> 41:18.940]  Albert is going to be walking around that house getting free bacon all day.
[41:19.460 --> 41:20.540]  He's getting his little bits.
[41:20.540 --> 41:25.740]  Yeah, I, I assume that anything from like bulldog neck down in the house is clean,
[41:25.860 --> 41:29.420]  but I'm finding, I'm finding bacon bits everywhere, dude.
[41:29.500 --> 41:31.100]  They're like in the cracks of the sofa.
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.160]  It's like, they went airborne and just covered the house.
[41:36.540 --> 41:42.620]  I think of all the bits, of all the meat bits, I think bacon is the best one that could have
[41:42.620 --> 41:43.200]  occurred with.
[41:44.520 --> 41:45.920]  So you have that going for you.
[41:46.080 --> 41:48.180]  Bacon bits are so overrated.
[41:48.500 --> 41:49.760]  They sound so much better than they are.
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.060]  Oh, I disagree.
[41:51.660 --> 41:52.060]  Yeah.
[41:52.240 --> 41:53.240]  I disagree as well.
[41:53.620 --> 41:57.260]  I love bacon. I just don't, I don't appreciate the bits format for bacon.
[41:57.680 --> 41:58.460]  They just go everywhere.
[41:58.500 --> 41:59.380]  On a baked potato?
[41:59.580 --> 42:00.180]  They do.
[42:00.460 --> 42:00.600]  Contain them?
[42:00.740 --> 42:01.880]  They go everywhere, everywhere.
[42:02.260 --> 42:06.740]  If you sprinkle 100 bits in a sandwich, you're getting like 80 bits in a sandwich.
[42:06.760 --> 42:07.880]  Why are you putting bits in a sandwich?
[42:07.880 --> 42:10.720]  Why would you put bacon bits on a sandwich, you lunatic?
[42:10.940 --> 42:12.540]  They're for salad and baked potatoes.
[42:13.200 --> 42:15.020]  I'm trying to think of where I've had bacon bits before.
[42:15.100 --> 42:17.460]  I was coming in to agree with Gavin, then he said that,
[42:17.460 --> 42:20.120]  and now I don't really feel like agreeing with Gavin.
[42:20.280 --> 42:22.600]  So wait, they're never used in sandwiches?
[42:23.260 --> 42:23.740]  No.
[42:24.260 --> 42:26.080]  What? No, bacon is used in sandwiches.
[42:26.840 --> 42:28.500]  I swear, that's where I've seen them.
[42:29.340 --> 42:30.640]  What? How would you eat?
[42:30.980 --> 42:31.500]  That's bacon.
[42:32.060 --> 42:35.160]  Maybe like a salad or like on mashed potatoes or something.
[42:35.320 --> 42:37.860]  Like you'd throw them on stuff where they would like hang out.
[42:39.500 --> 42:44.020]  I'm just imagining somebody pouring bacon bits onto a sandwich,
[42:44.020 --> 42:45.920]  like into a sandwich that they're making.
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.260]  And there's nothing, I think, more psychotic you could do in the sandwich making realm.
[42:50.600 --> 42:52.320]  Just covering it in bits.
[42:52.560 --> 42:54.160]  I swear, I've had that at a restaurant.
[42:54.880 --> 42:57.700]  I much prefer a full slice of bacon.
[42:57.820 --> 42:59.740]  I'm a, you know, bacon, big bacon butty guy.
[43:01.560 --> 43:04.000]  Yeah, I think that was just a shit restaurant.
[43:04.260 --> 43:05.960]  I don't think you could blame the bits on that.
[43:06.040 --> 43:07.060]  I think that's user error.
[43:09.640 --> 43:12.920]  Maybe we should all make salads around Geoff's fridge,
[43:12.920 --> 43:17.720]  and then he should blast the bits out into the room and see who gets the most bits.
[43:18.440 --> 43:20.160]  Okay, well, we have an office.
[43:20.240 --> 43:23.700]  Yeah, I was about to say, I don't want to do this because it's not at Geoff's house anymore.
[43:23.840 --> 43:24.720]  It's at our office.
[43:24.860 --> 43:27.960]  I don't know. I feel like maybe we need Geoff's crisper specifically for the...
[43:28.380 --> 43:30.120]  Oh, okay. I agree with Gavin again.
[43:30.400 --> 43:36.260]  I do like the idea of inventing a tool to, I don't know,
[43:36.740 --> 43:39.740]  improve bacon bit distribution, like a bacon blaster.
[43:40.320 --> 43:41.420]  A bacon bit blaster?
[43:41.420 --> 43:45.200]  Bacon bit blaster that we could blast onto our salads and our baked potatoes and stuff.
[43:45.480 --> 43:47.920]  Like maybe we could get into the lab and invent whatever that is.
[43:48.080 --> 43:51.280]  You know those salt guns that like...
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.100]  Yeah, bug assault.
[43:52.620 --> 43:57.500]  Yeah, yeah. I wonder if we made bacon bits small enough we could do that
[43:58.440 --> 44:02.000]  and then put bacon bits inside of the bug assault gun.
[44:03.440 --> 44:04.240]  And then...
[44:04.240 --> 44:06.800]  Something's gonna get real gummed up. We should definitely do it.
[44:07.080 --> 44:07.960]  Yes, we gotta do this.
[44:08.240 --> 44:10.580]  Okay, Geoff, do you want me to put it on the idea thing or you want to?
[44:10.580 --> 44:12.340]  No, if you wouldn't mind, thank you so much.
[44:12.340 --> 44:15.460]  Yeah, yeah, but I'm just gonna bacon bits bug assault and...
[44:16.200 --> 44:17.040]  Yeah, we got it.
[44:17.140 --> 44:19.440]  Can I also try and make my own bacon blaster?
[44:20.400 --> 44:23.340]  Absolutely. Gavin, I would be offended if you didn't.
[44:23.580 --> 44:23.960]  Yeah!
[44:24.060 --> 44:28.740]  I think mine's gonna involve a paintball gun and a very sharp...
[44:28.740 --> 44:29.540]  I can't wait.
[44:29.660 --> 44:30.920]  ...grid of wire at the end.
[44:33.120 --> 44:33.540]  What?
[44:33.900 --> 44:34.780]  You need a sharp grid of wire.
[44:34.860 --> 44:36.420]  Like in the Resident Evil movie?
[44:37.060 --> 44:40.260]  Yeah, yeah. It's gonna like Colin Salmon the bacon.
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.660]  Oh, I was thinking like bacon retrieval.
[44:45.160 --> 44:48.460]  Like you blast the bacon out and then you can pull it back in somehow.
[44:49.460 --> 44:50.660]  And then you fire again.
[44:50.900 --> 44:52.540]  You know, we can make that grid pretty easily.
[44:53.200 --> 44:54.860]  Pull the bacon back in?
[44:55.200 --> 44:58.240]  I thought it was like the wire was connected to the bit.
[44:58.540 --> 45:02.500]  And so you shoot the bit and then you retract the wire back to the gun.
[45:02.840 --> 45:03.780]  So you have an incident...
[45:03.780 --> 45:06.000]  So it's just for like, luring people?
[45:06.480 --> 45:09.140]  Like a taser to chase a piece of bacon.
[45:09.140 --> 45:10.920]  Tricking men and dogs.
[45:13.420 --> 45:14.660]  The women are fine though.
[45:14.880 --> 45:15.700]  They'll ignore the bacon.
[45:15.960 --> 45:17.300]  Yeah, they know it's a trick.
[45:17.460 --> 45:18.020]  They know it's a trick.
[45:18.120 --> 45:18.760]  They're smarter than that.
[45:18.820 --> 45:19.820]  Women don't fall for bacon.
[45:21.120 --> 45:24.120]  Oh man, it's too bad that Doom just came out because this is...
[45:24.120 --> 45:25.300]  Send them an idea.
[45:25.900 --> 45:27.860]  The BFG, now they got the BBB.
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.120]  Yeah, we'll get a mod going for the new Doom to put the bacon bit blaster in it.
[45:34.180 --> 45:37.960]  But then also we need someone to mod all the MILFs into Last of Us 2.
[45:37.960 --> 45:39.280]  We already have two mods.
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.120]  Who knew that in 2025 regulation was going to need a professional modder on staff?
[45:44.900 --> 45:48.800]  Can you imagine you're sitting at like a fancy-ish kind of restaurant?
[45:49.140 --> 45:50.080]  You order a dish.
[45:50.180 --> 45:51.140]  It has a baked potato.
[45:51.460 --> 45:53.980]  And then they say, would you like bacon bits on it?
[45:54.240 --> 45:55.000]  You say yes.
[45:55.120 --> 45:58.280]  And they pull out a gun and just start blasting your potato.
[45:58.860 --> 46:01.020]  Chunks of potatoes flying everywhere.
[46:02.060 --> 46:04.760]  Oh, grabs a shotgun with one hand.
[46:05.520 --> 46:06.960]  Fucking cocked and locked.
[46:06.960 --> 46:09.580]  How many blasts would you like, madam?
[46:10.440 --> 46:11.680]  I'll take two blasts, please.
[46:11.920 --> 46:13.780]  Load me up, six-shooter, let's go.
[46:15.160 --> 46:15.500]  Maybe.
[46:16.080 --> 46:18.200]  I think a potato is a great example of the bits.
[46:18.820 --> 46:20.700]  There's no way all of the bits are staying on the spud.
[46:21.440 --> 46:22.240]  Well, they go in, man.
[46:22.340 --> 46:22.880]  You open the...
[46:22.880 --> 46:24.180]  Yeah, you put the...
[46:24.180 --> 46:26.360]  I know, he doesn't understand bacon bits at all.
[46:26.360 --> 46:27.820]  You've never had a baked potato before?
[46:28.360 --> 46:30.040]  Yeah, but there's no...
[46:30.040 --> 46:30.700]  Do you think...
[46:30.700 --> 46:35.620]  Okay, so if I gave you a baked potato, jacket potato, and I said put 100 bits on that,
[46:35.620 --> 46:37.940]  you would get all of them just to stay on the potato?
[46:38.240 --> 46:39.580]  I don't know if I'd use 100 bits.
[46:39.700 --> 46:43.040]  I mean, I'd probably get like 90 of them in there.
[46:43.560 --> 46:45.440]  Yeah, you... for me...
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.180]  Cut open the baked potato, mush it around a little bit,
[46:48.300 --> 46:51.640]  throw some butter in there, sour cream if you're fucking weird, I'm not.
[46:52.100 --> 46:54.880]  You know, throw some chives in and then dump in the bacon bits and
[46:54.880 --> 46:57.280]  they're in the potato bowl that you've created.
[46:57.660 --> 47:00.760]  I would even sometimes mix with the bits already in.
[47:01.360 --> 47:04.580]  So you put the bits in and then you start mixing it all around because it's...
[47:04.580 --> 47:05.060]  There you go.
[47:05.880 --> 47:06.520]  Massaging it.
[47:06.720 --> 47:11.400]  Is there a way we can change our Twitch bits icon to bacon?
[47:12.040 --> 47:12.740]  I don't know.
[47:13.120 --> 47:16.080]  Bits? I don't think we can. It would just have to be our currency,
[47:16.600 --> 47:17.880]  like our regulation points.
[47:18.280 --> 47:20.060]  I don't think we can do... we can call them bacon bits.
[47:20.420 --> 47:21.840]  Why don't we just call them bacon bits?
[47:22.240 --> 47:23.660]  Yeah, I mean, I got no problem with that.
[47:24.340 --> 47:29.500]  I really... this conversation has led to me thinking about a novelty restaurant
[47:30.020 --> 47:32.760]  that shoots everything with weapons at you,
[47:32.760 --> 47:35.320]  but doesn't advertise they do that at all.
[47:36.040 --> 47:38.440]  So like the premise of bacon bits.
[47:38.700 --> 47:41.820]  That is the scariest restaurant. Oh my god.
[47:42.620 --> 47:45.660]  Do you want... someone orders a salad. Do you want cracked pepper on this?
[47:45.760 --> 47:46.500]  And it's like, yeah, sure.
[47:46.580 --> 47:50.600]  They pull out like a chain gun to crack it and just unload on the salad.
[47:50.700 --> 47:53.280]  Just everything is shot at the food.
[47:54.500 --> 47:55.340]  Oh, that'd be great.
[47:56.220 --> 47:57.620]  What a terrible idea.
[47:57.760 --> 47:58.880]  Oh, food guns.
[48:01.280 --> 48:04.740]  Condiments just bouncing off your plate like a super soaker.
[48:04.980 --> 48:07.680]  It would be cool if there was a restaurant that had just like a constant...
[48:08.620 --> 48:11.620]  like imagine a ketchup gun and it would just shoot ketchup
[48:11.620 --> 48:14.500]  across the restaurant into like a catchment bucket.
[48:14.780 --> 48:17.240]  And if you wanted ketchup, you just had to lift your food up
[48:17.820 --> 48:19.760]  and take one of the ketchup hits.
[48:21.560 --> 48:24.700]  Oh, isn't that like when you put your hand...
[48:24.700 --> 48:26.380]  there's like some restaurant where you like put your hand up
[48:26.380 --> 48:29.140]  and like they throw rolls to you from like across the restaurant.
[48:29.220 --> 48:30.440]  So it's kind of like that.
[48:30.580 --> 48:31.160]  That's fun.
[48:32.140 --> 48:34.860]  I was more imagining with what Gavin is saying.
[48:35.240 --> 48:38.340]  You know how they're like Japanese restaurants with conveyor belts.
[48:38.740 --> 48:39.880]  It's like that.
[48:39.940 --> 48:44.900]  It's almost like a rainforest cafe, but there's a river that runs by every table
[48:44.900 --> 48:48.060]  and they just rotate out what condiment is going down the river.
[48:48.660 --> 48:51.500]  So it's like a Wonka factory style.
[48:51.700 --> 48:53.060]  Like it could just be like a ketchup river.
[48:53.520 --> 48:53.960]  Exactly.
[48:53.960 --> 48:56.240]  So like if it's ketchup, you want some ketchup,
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.620]  you just dip your fries in the river as it's going by.
[48:59.420 --> 49:01.320]  I just wouldn't want to be at the end of the river.
[49:01.920 --> 49:06.020]  What if... what if it's a river of water that moves,
[49:06.120 --> 49:09.900]  but there's little boats on the river and there's different condiments in the boats?
[49:10.640 --> 49:13.700]  You can like dip your nugget in the boat as it goes by.
[49:14.020 --> 49:16.440]  You gotta... you gotta capsize the boat, though.
[49:16.480 --> 49:18.400]  That's gonna be... it's gonna be watery condiments.
[49:19.140 --> 49:19.600]  Yeah, maybe.
[49:20.140 --> 49:24.040]  And I don't want to take a bread roll from a boat.
[49:24.500 --> 49:25.200]  Why not?
[49:25.320 --> 49:27.860]  You'd rather have somebody throw it to your hand from across the room?
[49:28.280 --> 49:30.680]  I mean, it's it's a revolving sushi concept, right?
[49:30.680 --> 49:31.400]  But it's little boats.
[49:31.700 --> 49:31.920]  Yeah.
[49:31.980 --> 49:32.640]  And it's ketchup.
[49:33.040 --> 49:33.720]  Oh, there you go.
[49:34.140 --> 49:35.140]  Of course it exists.
[49:35.560 --> 49:35.780]  Yeah.
[49:36.020 --> 49:37.800]  Yeah, it's just revolving sushi, but on a boat.
[49:37.980 --> 49:38.860]  And then, yeah.
[49:39.180 --> 49:40.200]  That, but mustard.
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.620]  I think rolls are the most catchable food that you would have in a restaurant.
[49:47.880 --> 49:48.840]  Somebody threw it at you.
[49:49.600 --> 49:55.380]  Well, I think for the for the little tiny river, I think hot dogs would be the perfect food for that.
[49:56.080 --> 49:58.320]  Because it's quite skinny, it could be quite a thin river.
[49:59.660 --> 50:01.520]  Like they just float the hot dog on down to you?
[50:01.800 --> 50:03.340]  Yeah, like buns going by.
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.980]  So you'd be okay with a hot dog bun going down the river, but not a roll going down the river?
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.780]  I would like my bun to be wrapped in foil.
[50:12.360 --> 50:12.660]  Okay.
[50:13.640 --> 50:15.680]  I assumed it was a wet bread issue.
[50:16.120 --> 50:17.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:18.660 --> 50:21.640]  What would be the worst food to catch at a restaurant?
[50:22.760 --> 50:23.360]  Oh, man.
[50:23.360 --> 50:23.580]  Like soup?
[50:24.200 --> 50:26.060]  I guess soup would be tough because you couldn't.
[50:26.260 --> 50:28.460]  Mashed potatoes would be tough because it would just go everywhere.
[50:28.560 --> 50:30.100]  Chili would be a motherfucker.
[50:30.480 --> 50:31.600]  Chili is a, yeah, yeah.
[50:31.660 --> 50:34.880]  I don't think you can even do liquids. Like that would be, that's too crazy.
[50:35.020 --> 50:36.840]  Like it has to be solid in some form.
[50:37.660 --> 50:37.940]  Um.
[50:38.280 --> 50:38.700]  Spaghetti.
[50:40.500 --> 50:41.660]  Spaghetti would be tough.
[50:42.380 --> 50:45.980]  But maybe you could like wrap the spaghetti around a meatball.
[50:45.980 --> 50:48.400]  To like kind of contain it.
[50:48.640 --> 50:49.860]  Yeah, like spaghetti ball kind of situation.
[50:50.100 --> 50:50.680]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:50.800 --> 50:55.640]  Has anyone ever had meatballs completely yarn balled by spaghetti?
[50:56.840 --> 50:57.740]  I don't know.
[50:57.880 --> 50:59.180]  I don't think so.
[50:59.860 --> 51:02.180]  Like reverse spaghetti and meatballs?
[51:02.760 --> 51:05.560]  Yeah, but it's just like each one is a complete bite of spaghetti.
[51:06.080 --> 51:06.300]  Yeah.
[51:06.680 --> 51:07.840]  Completely encasing a meatball.
[51:08.060 --> 51:10.560]  I think it's probably really tough to do it.
[51:10.720 --> 51:15.600]  Has anybody ever done the opposite and hollowed out a meatball and filled it with spaghetti?
[51:15.980 --> 51:17.200]  And then closed it back up?
[51:17.500 --> 51:18.420]  I feel like that'd be easier.
[51:18.940 --> 51:20.280]  That would definitely be easier.
[51:21.400 --> 51:26.060]  Because I don't know how you'd make it stick with the roll of the spaghetti.
[51:26.460 --> 51:27.560]  I feel like it would just untangle.
[51:28.820 --> 51:30.520]  Meatball with spaghetti inside.
[51:30.520 --> 51:32.000]  Dude, no way.
[51:33.000 --> 51:33.640]  Oh my god!
[51:33.640 --> 51:34.740]  Wow, it exists as well!
[51:35.280 --> 51:36.080]  Everything's real!
[51:37.760 --> 51:40.940]  I feel like that's a lazy, that's a lazy ball of yarn though.
[51:40.960 --> 51:41.740]  I can see the meatball.
[51:42.000 --> 51:42.540]  Yeah, I agree.
[51:42.640 --> 51:44.740]  There's also the kind of the other way, I think.
[51:46.320 --> 51:49.160]  That's similar, but not as good as what I was thinking.
[51:49.420 --> 51:53.060]  Yeah, yeah, I think what you're thinking, Geoff, is right around here.
[51:53.500 --> 51:54.740]  Ah, damn it!
[51:56.340 --> 52:01.760]  It's a giant meatball cake with an innard of spaghetti.
[52:02.080 --> 52:04.740]  It's called inside-out spaghetti.
[52:05.360 --> 52:08.360]  These are all interesting-looking gimmicks that I assume are gonna be
[52:08.360 --> 52:09.880]  not as good as just a bowl of spaghetti.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.440]  No, definitely not.
[52:12.900 --> 52:15.580]  But I do like the idea of a restaurant where when you go in,
[52:15.580 --> 52:17.680]  they give you a baseball glove to catch your food.
[52:18.140 --> 52:19.280]  Everyone's got gloves on.
[52:20.020 --> 52:22.160]  Food glove. Could the glove be bread so you can eat it after?
[52:22.840 --> 52:23.040]  Yeah.
[52:23.720 --> 52:25.720]  Imagine a baseball mitt of bread.
[52:26.420 --> 52:30.440]  Imagine how gross that would be, though, to eat that bread after you put your hand in it
[52:30.440 --> 52:31.600]  and caught things.
[52:32.160 --> 52:33.940]  No, it's gonna have all the flavor of all the food.
[52:35.380 --> 52:37.500]  Yeah, your hand, oh god, it's gross.
[52:38.040 --> 52:40.720]  It'd be perfect if you still had taste buds on your fingers, though.
[52:41.300 --> 52:44.860]  If there's a bad throw and you catch somebody else's meal, that's just free for you.
[52:44.860 --> 52:47.180]  And they still got to make the meal for the other person.
[52:47.300 --> 52:50.200]  But any food you catch that isn't yours, it's fair game.
[52:50.680 --> 52:51.940]  You just get an additional dish.
[52:52.060 --> 52:54.400]  I bet a beef wellington would be good to catch.
[52:55.080 --> 52:55.440]  Oh, yes.
[52:55.880 --> 52:58.600]  Anything that's like really nicely contained with all the ingredients.
[52:59.180 --> 52:59.300]  Yeah.
[52:59.640 --> 53:01.820]  Do you think you could eat your way out of a bread helmet?
[53:03.740 --> 53:04.880]  Not for me, no.
[53:10.140 --> 53:11.400]  How thick is the helmet?
[53:11.540 --> 53:13.820]  And are we talking like a Spartan helmet?
[53:14.860 --> 53:18.000]  Are we talking like a fully encased head helmet?
[53:18.380 --> 53:20.980]  I like that I say helmet and you immediately go to Spartan.
[53:21.240 --> 53:24.080]  Well, I'm thinking that's, to me, the first helmet I think of.
[53:24.340 --> 53:26.760]  Are we talking like an astronaut type?
[53:27.500 --> 53:28.180]  What do you mean?
[53:28.320 --> 53:28.760]  What do you mean?
[53:28.860 --> 53:29.280]  What do you mean?
[53:30.320 --> 53:31.100]  What do you mean?
[53:32.820 --> 53:33.880]  Somebody says helmet.
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.560]  That's the first helmet I think of is the Spartan helmet.
[53:37.300 --> 53:38.120]  God damn it.
[53:38.320 --> 53:39.480]  Someone's got a bread helmet?
[53:39.920 --> 53:40.760]  God damn.
[53:45.580 --> 53:49.580]  Oh, check the YouTube or video version on Patreon for this.
[53:50.160 --> 53:51.080]  Oh, my God.
[53:51.300 --> 53:54.140]  I would argue that what that person is wearing is not a bread helmet,
[53:54.180 --> 53:58.260]  but is actually the start of a Katamari ball that they are just part of.
[53:58.380 --> 54:00.460]  Yeah, that's like a bread roof.
[54:00.600 --> 54:01.900]  That's more like bread shingles.
[54:04.160 --> 54:05.980]  Oh, that's sort of a bread helmet.
[54:06.800 --> 54:08.320]  That's definitely a bread helmet.
[54:08.640 --> 54:08.880]  Yeah.
[54:10.140 --> 54:13.420]  No, but I you don't think what's the helmet you think of
[54:13.420 --> 54:14.920]  immediately when somebody says helmet?
[54:16.900 --> 54:17.620]  Oh, interesting.
[54:17.880 --> 54:18.480]  There you go, football.
[54:19.320 --> 54:21.040]  I think of an army Kevlar helmet.
[54:21.460 --> 54:24.900]  Yeah, I was thinking more of like a sports helmet.
[54:25.340 --> 54:26.800]  So you don't even have a helmet in mind.
[54:26.900 --> 54:28.300]  You're coming at me for my Spartan helmet.
[54:30.260 --> 54:33.740]  But I just I if someone said, quick, put on a helmet,
[54:33.800 --> 54:35.560]  I wouldn't try looking for a Spartan one.
[54:35.920 --> 54:37.740]  I wouldn't look for one because I don't have one.
[54:37.780 --> 54:39.800]  But that's the first imagery that I think of.
[54:39.800 --> 54:44.460]  All those fancy Zack Snyder shots of people in Spartan helmets.
[54:44.760 --> 54:45.260]  Yeah.
[54:45.640 --> 54:47.180]  Imagine that, but a loaf.
[54:49.920 --> 54:51.960]  Speaking of speaking of helmets.
[54:53.040 --> 54:53.800]  Nick's wearing the mask.
[54:54.300 --> 54:55.960]  Yeah, Nick's Nick's definitely wearing the mask.
[54:56.160 --> 54:57.520]  Yeah, it's pretty fucking clear.
[54:57.860 --> 54:58.200]  Fuck!
[55:01.480 --> 55:02.760]  We got him!
[55:03.640 --> 55:05.460]  I didn't think we'd ever win this game!
[55:05.740 --> 55:06.240]  We got you!
[55:06.340 --> 55:07.160]  Yep, yep.
[55:07.340 --> 55:08.300]  We got you.
[55:08.340 --> 55:09.040]  We got the monkey.
[55:09.040 --> 55:09.940]  We got the monkey.
[55:10.100 --> 55:14.100]  We did it!
[55:14.620 --> 55:16.700]  Oh, I'm so mad right now.
[55:17.020 --> 55:18.400]  I was like, 10 minutes, 10 minutes.
[55:18.640 --> 55:21.300]  I texted the group.
[55:21.740 --> 55:24.960]  So 10 minutes into the episode, I think Nick is wearing the mask.
[55:26.180 --> 55:29.580]  Nick, you become a different person with the mask on.
[55:29.780 --> 55:33.240]  You were in monkey mode the whole time.
[55:34.060 --> 55:36.560]  And that was and I just kept having to ask you to repeat yourself
[55:36.560 --> 55:37.480]  because you were so far away.
[55:37.480 --> 55:38.960]  I never have to do that with Nick.
[55:39.040 --> 55:39.620]  This is weird.
[55:40.380 --> 55:42.680]  I feel like when I was asking him about the audio things,
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.720]  I originally was on your side, Eric.
[55:45.780 --> 55:47.540]  And then I thought he answered that pretty clearly.
[55:47.560 --> 55:51.320]  But I thought maybe he's like pushing his mouth to the front of the mask to try and
[55:51.820 --> 55:56.320]  and then I figured towards the end, no one would know better than Eric.
[55:56.700 --> 55:59.400]  Why didn't you just open the mouth and talk normal?
[56:00.500 --> 56:01.860]  I've been told that that's cheating.
[56:02.000 --> 56:02.460]  That is cheating.
[56:02.840 --> 56:02.980]  Yeah.
[56:03.180 --> 56:05.300]  Okay, that's great that you didn't do that.
[56:05.840 --> 56:06.080]  Yeah.
[56:08.060 --> 56:13.360]  For me, it was this the quiet answering sort of like the way that you were,
[56:13.440 --> 56:18.520]  you sounded far from like the microphone, but way more ooze and yes,
[56:18.780 --> 56:21.560]  like you were in 100% eat mode.
[56:21.740 --> 56:22.260]  Yeah.
[56:22.740 --> 56:23.840]  Always about my own petard.
[56:23.940 --> 56:25.600]  It's 100% caught.
[56:27.260 --> 56:29.660]  Now, back when I made my grade GTA mistake,
[56:30.400 --> 56:32.940]  I am locked in now when we do this podcast.
[56:33.300 --> 56:37.420]  So I didn't immediately notice the Eric text until quite a bit later.
[56:37.420 --> 56:39.920]  And me trying to catch up on what happened.
[56:40.220 --> 56:42.540]  And I felt like such a fucking idiot
[56:42.540 --> 56:45.720]  after doing that, because there's a point I felt like.
[56:45.820 --> 56:47.300]  And this is a very specific reference.
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.200]  Tom Sandoval and the traders where they had they set up a way to like catch a trader.
[56:52.460 --> 56:56.020]  And then he just fucks it up by like explaining for them out of it,
[56:56.020 --> 56:58.340]  where Geoff was like, Nick, could you repeat that?
[56:58.380 --> 57:03.400]  And I answered for Nick and understanding the context of what Geoff was doing at that point.
[57:03.400 --> 57:04.720]  I was like, I'm a fucking idiot.
[57:05.020 --> 57:07.800]  We're trying to get more TikTok in a subtle way.
[57:07.840 --> 57:09.140]  You're the Tom Sandoval of this podcast.
[57:09.540 --> 57:10.680]  No, I don't.
[57:10.780 --> 57:11.860]  Don't put that on me.
[57:12.140 --> 57:13.700]  But it was a Tom Sandoval.
[57:13.820 --> 57:19.080]  I've thought of that in the traders where I just threw not being part of the loop.
[57:19.200 --> 57:21.240]  In his case, he's just a fucking idiot.
[57:21.420 --> 57:24.040]  But I didn't know what we were doing.
[57:25.240 --> 57:29.600]  Yeah, there was a lot of extra like, what if I swapped asses with Nick?
[57:29.720 --> 57:31.640]  Hey, Nick, what was wrong with all that audio?
[57:32.700 --> 57:37.840]  I do love that there's a whole conversation going on throughout the entire podcast of us
[57:37.840 --> 57:40.580]  texting that Andrew finally got onto.
[57:41.160 --> 57:43.600]  Halfway through, though, Gavin's like, I'm not convinced.
[57:43.780 --> 57:45.300]  And it's like, what would convince you?
[57:45.420 --> 57:46.080]  So obvious, man.
[57:46.120 --> 57:48.120]  Like, I felt like it was very obvious.
[57:48.400 --> 57:50.720]  I got de-convinced after he was talking about the audio,
[57:50.780 --> 57:52.560]  because I thought, oh, you can hear this pretty well.
[57:54.920 --> 57:56.300]  Well, Nick, we got you.
[57:58.100 --> 58:00.540]  I got got. I can't believe it.
[58:00.660 --> 58:01.620]  What does this mean now?
[58:01.640 --> 58:02.720]  I don't know.
[58:02.820 --> 58:03.520]  I was about to say.
[58:04.060 --> 58:04.680]  Oh, I have no idea.
[58:04.880 --> 58:05.260]  Oh, I don't know.
[58:05.360 --> 58:06.340]  We win 2025.
[58:07.140 --> 58:07.880]  Yes. Yeah.
[58:08.340 --> 58:10.100]  There was a prize for it, I think.
[58:10.640 --> 58:11.620]  I didn't get a prize ever.
[58:11.840 --> 58:12.440]  I think the audience...
[58:15.060 --> 58:16.880]  The audience will let us know if there's a prize.
[58:17.080 --> 58:17.500]  Yeah, if they...
[58:17.500 --> 58:17.980]  They remember.
[58:18.340 --> 58:19.060]  They will know.
[58:19.900 --> 58:21.020]  I just can't believe...
[58:21.020 --> 58:22.720]  I didn't think we'd ever win this game.
[58:23.160 --> 58:25.180]  So we're good till 2026.
[58:25.380 --> 58:26.120]  Yeah, we don't have to worry.
[58:26.460 --> 58:27.880]  The watch has ended.
[58:28.460 --> 58:29.420]  We can all stand down.
[58:30.040 --> 58:30.240]  Yeah.
[58:30.500 --> 58:31.520]  Yeah, we can all stand down.
[58:32.120 --> 58:33.760]  Eric, that was phenomenal work.
[58:33.760 --> 58:34.160]  Thank you.
[58:34.240 --> 58:34.840]  It was just...
[58:34.840 --> 58:36.140]  I run two companies with this guy.
[58:36.260 --> 58:37.500]  I know when he's in monkey mode, baby.
[58:37.840 --> 58:39.520]  Also, hell of a hell of a try, Nick.
[58:39.900 --> 58:41.080]  Really appreciate how bold you were.
[58:41.520 --> 58:41.660]  Yeah.
[58:41.760 --> 58:43.760]  Well, I thought you hadn't heard me in it yet.
[58:43.980 --> 58:44.660]  No, I thought you did great.
[58:44.680 --> 58:45.100]  So maybe I can say goodbye.
[58:45.680 --> 58:45.820]  Yeah.
[58:46.440 --> 58:46.700]  Fuck.
[58:46.880 --> 58:47.580]  Tough stuff, dude.
[58:47.700 --> 58:48.160]  Tough stuff.
[58:48.280 --> 58:49.160]  Oh, I'm so disappointed.
[58:49.400 --> 58:50.680]  Also, way to play it off.
[58:50.720 --> 58:51.760]  Had no idea you were on to me.
[58:51.980 --> 58:54.080]  You know, just getting that text going.
[58:54.140 --> 58:55.160]  I'm like, oh, should we slack?
[58:55.260 --> 58:56.660]  I'm like, they're not going to see it if we're slacking.
[58:56.880 --> 58:57.760]  It had to be a text.
[58:57.880 --> 59:00.440]  And then, man, I just felt like...
[59:00.440 --> 59:01.660]  We're on top of this.
[59:01.780 --> 59:02.440]  We got this guy.
[59:02.540 --> 59:03.820]  We got this fucking monkey right here.
[59:03.920 --> 59:06.360]  We're like Lorenz and Lorenz's local lawyers.
[59:06.540 --> 59:07.880]  We're on top of it.
[59:08.540 --> 59:12.320]  I was so sure that I had you that I was rolling on me the whole time.
[59:12.580 --> 59:12.960]  Awesome!
[59:13.960 --> 59:15.500]  I knew within 10 minutes.
[59:15.860 --> 59:16.960]  That's just a lot of footage.
[59:17.140 --> 59:19.680]  We just we decided to wait until the end of the episode.
[59:20.520 --> 59:21.880]  God, you really got my hopes up.
[59:22.420 --> 59:26.940]  The thing that surprised me most is that this is the beginning of a text conversation with
[59:26.940 --> 59:27.860]  everyone except Nick.
[59:27.900 --> 59:30.100]  And I thought that would have existed already, but it didn't.
[59:31.320 --> 59:32.040]  It does.
[59:34.520 --> 59:38.880]  It doesn't for me, so maybe it's a text conversation with Geoff and Nick.
[59:39.340 --> 59:42.800]  Nope, it's the four of us.
[59:42.920 --> 59:44.920]  And I have a bunch of texts from...
[59:44.920 --> 59:46.660]  Well, now Nick's going to feel left out.
[59:47.220 --> 59:49.560]  For me, it starts with, I think Nick is wearing the mask.
[59:49.840 --> 59:51.200]  These are all from like 2024.
[59:51.800 --> 59:52.980]  When we were working with Nick.
[59:53.120 --> 59:54.000]  2024, 2023.
[59:54.680 --> 59:56.500]  Yeah, I have like a lot of stuff.
[59:57.380 --> 59:57.620]  What?
[59:57.800 --> 59:58.540]  It's not a lot.
[59:58.620 --> 59:59.940]  Whatever he's saying, it's not a lot, Nick.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.980]  I don't know.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:03.060]  I don't...
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:04.200]  Listen, I don't...
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.460]  Trying to not make feel Nick feel bad.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:07.420]  It's not one way or the other.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.500]  I'm telling you that there's a bunch of texts from this group.
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.720]  Why can't I see them?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.600]  I don't know.
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:15.880]  I'm just telling you what I have.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.400]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.080]  Sounds fake.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.380]  Oh, it might be because of Geoff's broken ass RCS.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.200]  It might have been a different thread for me.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.200]  Might be.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900]  There's pictures of...
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.600]  There's like an iguana jumping and eating a french fry.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.580]  There's a video from like people like, I guess, me dancing at Geoff's wedding.
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:38.380]  And yeah, there's like a bunch of stuff.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:39.760]  You just didn't want Nick to know?
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:40.700]  Huh.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:41.780]  Who's...
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.960]  Are you talking about me?
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.060]  Yeah, sounds like it.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.620]  The guy who didn't text those things?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:46.720]  Sure.
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:51.520]  Yeah, I didn't want Nick to know about the stuff you guys texted to me.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.140]  Absolutely.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:57.640]  It was great when Geoff's phone was fucked up because I would text something in one group text
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.960]  and then I would reply in a completely different text.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.800]  It would be a completely different conversation.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.660]  It was crazy.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.180]  And I wouldn't get any of it.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.440]  And we would be making decisions about the company that I didn't know anything about.
[01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:13.880]  And then I'd have to figure it out from context clues later when I'm like, did we decide to do that?
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.360]  We just shouldn't talk about work outside of Slack.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:19.260]  Yeah.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.180]  It is the work platform.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.200]  Is that the slogan?
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.620]  Yeah, it is.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.340]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.980]  They got dicks in every direction and it's your work platform.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.620]  I know why we sometimes talk on a text chain without Nick.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.960]  It's because we're planning a thing.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.360]  There you go.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:36.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.840]  What the fuck does that mean?
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:39.760]  Well, it's clearly about you.
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.120]  That's all you can't know.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.380]  Not the prank that you were talking about.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.460]  Well, we should probably wrap this one up so that way we can do another.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.820]  We're doing two this week again.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:52.360]  I'm excited.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.860]  Just FYI for everyone.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.400]  Uh, so we should probably wrap this one up so we can get into the next one.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:58.320]  How do you guys feel about that?
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:01:59.620]  I feel great about it.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:00.660]  Let's do it.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.680]  I just feel great that we can relax now for the rest of the year.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.120]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.100]  Yeah, put our feet up and just pure joy.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.100]  Easy peasy podcasting now.
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.800]  I feel like shit.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.700]  What I love about this game, being the last man in the rotation is I'm never really playing.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.380]  It's a game that we either win or lose without me having any impact at all.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:22.820]  It's great.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.900]  I just get to observe even though I'm on the team.
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:25.160]  All right.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.380]  It looks like 2026.
[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:30.540]  We're waiting for Andrew's sort of go and we'll see if he's on the watch.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.320]  We'll see how it goes.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.200]  Very interesting.
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.400]  Very, very interesting.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.540]  But you don't have to wait till 2026 to hear us be idiots again, because we'll be doing it
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.720]  next week right here on Regulation Podcast episode 58.
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.460]  Hope to see or hear you there.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:47.200]  Bye bye.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:48.120]  Bye.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:50.220]  Man.
