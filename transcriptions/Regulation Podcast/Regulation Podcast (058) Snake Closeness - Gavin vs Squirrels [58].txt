[00:00.000 --> 00:05.500]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 58. I'm Geoff,
[00:05.600 --> 00:14.300]  got Eric, Andrew, Nick, and Eric here with me as well. Duh boys, as they need to be referred to.
[00:14.500 --> 00:20.820]  Did I say Eric twice? Hey, a guy like me likes hearing his name, so just say it four times, man.
[00:23.280 --> 00:29.160]  Happy to be here and happy to be here. Okay, what if we do this? What if we do this? Eric,
[00:29.160 --> 00:34.480]  at the end of this recording, you take my audio file and you re-record everything I said. Yeah.
[00:34.660 --> 00:37.620]  And then there'll be two Erics in the episode and people have to figure out who was who.
[00:37.960 --> 00:41.080]  Yeah, I think they would know right away just from this conversation.
[00:41.640 --> 00:46.480]  Yeah, it's probably short circuits. You just said, hey Eric, do this.
[00:47.200 --> 00:49.980]  Oh, I would love to listen to a double Eric cut and just see how it sounds.
[00:50.200 --> 00:53.900]  I think that would be the lowest listened to episode. They'd just be like, too much of this
[00:53.900 --> 00:58.740]  guy, no thanks. Like Captain Crunch, oops, all berries. Regulation, oops, all Erics.
[01:01.220 --> 01:06.020]  Terrible. Eric just plays every role in the podcast. An endless echo chamber of this sucks.
[01:10.320 --> 01:18.380]  Oh, Christ. Well, that was a flawless beginning to the episode. Very, very excited. Hey,
[01:18.400 --> 01:23.020]  I did something yesterday. I prepared something for you guys. I'm kind of jazzed about.
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.860]  I went on my first bike ride of the year, really. And I went on a bike ride in the way I used to
[01:29.860 --> 01:34.020]  back when we would do Face and I would go for a ride and I would just try to write down everything
[01:34.020 --> 01:39.140]  I saw on the bike ride and turn that into like things Geoff saw on his bike. Well, I did. I did
[01:39.140 --> 01:42.040]  that and I prepared it for you guys. And I'd love to share it with you if you'd like.
[01:42.100 --> 01:43.660]  Please use your ass or someone else's.
[01:43.980 --> 01:50.240]  It was on my ass. And I know, I know intimately because of the very particular pains that I have
[01:50.240 --> 01:55.640]  riding my bicycle long distances with my little ass. First thing I thought about when I was on my
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.360]  bike ride doing, I was just riding around Town Lake looking for dead bodies as you do now on
[02:00.360 --> 02:03.780]  Town Lake because there's a new one about every three weeks. Haven't seen one yet, but I did see
[02:03.780 --> 02:09.120]  a bunch of cops milling around suspiciously. So who knows? But I was riding around and as I was
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.920]  looking at the swampy water waiting to find a hand or a foot floating, I got to thinking about
[02:13.920 --> 02:20.060]  what was the last time I saw a snake? And I think it was on the trail about three years ago,
[02:20.060 --> 02:26.040]  a snake drove and like drove, I guess drove, rode, walked, slithered in front of me from one
[02:26.040 --> 02:31.900]  side of the trail to the other. And it scared the holy hell out of me, of course. And I got to
[02:31.900 --> 02:39.140]  thinking, I'm guaranteed to see another snake in my lifetime, but I don't know when. So it's really
[02:39.140 --> 02:45.220]  kind of like that movie It Follows. You know what I mean? Like every day I wake up, I'm closer to
[02:45.220 --> 02:50.320]  seeing my next snake and I don't, I don't know when or where, so there's nothing I can do to
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.340]  prepare about it. But also right now on this planet, there is a snake somewhere or the parents
[02:56.340 --> 03:03.200]  of a snake somewhere who are making decisions that put them closer and closer to interacting and
[03:03.200 --> 03:09.540]  intersecting with me in my life at some point in the undefined future. And that thought terrifies
[03:09.540 --> 03:14.380]  me. But it's not a guarantee. Yeah, it's not. I think it's pretty guaranteed that I'm going to
[03:14.380 --> 03:18.620]  see a snake again in my future. When do you think I'm going to go the next 50 years? Like I just
[03:18.620 --> 03:23.020]  told you, dickhead, three years ago on the trail. I don't think you did just say that's how this
[03:23.020 --> 03:27.140]  whole started. You played GTA. Did you just say you're going to live for another 50 years? Oh,
[03:27.160 --> 03:33.040]  at least I'm going to hit 100 for sure. Hell yeah. Just like spite, spite is like a motivator
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.560]  and like you're just like writing it out. See, that's the thing. My family lives into their
[03:37.560 --> 03:43.160]  mid to late 90s and they do it without the spite that fuels me, right? Like the spite thing is,
[03:43.160 --> 03:48.460]  I think, unique to me and my personality and my family. So I feel like I might also, technology,
[03:48.720 --> 03:54.380]  things are advancing rapidly, thanks to AI. I might eke out 150. Who knows? Maybe we'll get
[03:54.380 --> 03:59.660]  to a point where I can download my consciousness into some sort of computer software and I'll just
[03:59.660 --> 04:06.660]  be eternal. But I do think that with modern medicine, I'm good for 100. Maybe I'd like to
[04:06.660 --> 04:13.880]  top out at, I mean, I'd like to get to 150 if I could, but I'll be, I'll be happy to hit the
[04:13.880 --> 04:18.960]  century mark. So I figure, you know, that's roughly 50 more years of life. I think about
[04:18.960 --> 04:24.220]  how many snakes I saw in the first 50 years, dozens and dozens, if not a hundred, right? So
[04:24.220 --> 04:29.380]  there'll be, there'll be some measure of snake in my future. And every day that I live puts me
[04:29.380 --> 04:35.640]  closer and closer to that snake. And I don't like that. That's like 2700 more podcasts.
[04:37.300 --> 04:41.460]  I mean, assuming you guys live that long. That's a good point. You're not going to keep
[04:41.460 --> 04:45.820]  going without us? Uh, well, you know what? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
[04:46.060 --> 04:50.720]  Who knows? Who can say? Every episode of Soul All Right will just be, did I see a snake today?
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.500]  Didn't we talk about the podcast not going on if one of us dies, unless it's Andrew and he said
[04:56.500 --> 05:01.240]  it's fine if Nick isn't here? Oh, that's true. That is true. That's not at all what I said.
[05:01.820 --> 05:09.340]  That's literally the opposite of what I said. Oh yeah. Nick is so malleable. Not that you should
[05:09.340 --> 05:14.220]  be thrilled, Nick. I think I said that I would kill Nick because it would end the show. Because
[05:14.220 --> 05:20.440]  the scenario was if one of us died, if you had to kill one of us, or if we had the authority to kill
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.460]  somebody else in the group. Yeah, we all wanted Nick to live. We all said first, Nick is most
[05:25.460 --> 05:29.140]  important to live. And Andrew said, Nope, I'm going to take him out first. Yeah, just so it
[05:29.140 --> 05:34.240]  ends. Was that was that the stipulation that it would just you would kill him and it would end?
[05:34.620 --> 05:38.980]  Well, yeah, because everyone agreed he was the most important. Yeah, that would be like,
[05:39.060 --> 05:43.160]  yeah, the death knell for the show. Everyone agreed he's most important, so you'd kill him.
[05:43.580 --> 05:49.040]  Yeah, that was the point. To end it, he said. To end it. Right. It was a joke. Funny joke.
[05:49.280 --> 05:54.500]  This isn't the only podcast I've ever done. You know, there could be. Wearing the mask again?
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.460]  Additional and different podcasts in the future. Nick, you can take the mask off.
[05:59.900 --> 06:04.120]  So, Geoff, are you saying there's potentially more than 2700 podcasts in you?
[06:04.660 --> 06:12.700]  Oh, I would hope so. I don't think so. I'll be happy if I get 27 more podcasts out of this body
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.360]  and this brain in this mouth. But anyway, so that was my first thought was that I'm
[06:18.360 --> 06:24.940]  essentially living in a snake follows horror movie situation. And there's next to nothing
[06:24.940 --> 06:29.060]  I can do about it other than to move to a place with no snakes. But even then,
[06:29.380 --> 06:34.980]  people import snakes. You know, I've seen Final Destination. Weird shit happens. If the universe
[06:34.980 --> 06:37.980]  wants to put a snake in front of me, it's going to put a fucking snake in front of me no matter
[06:37.980 --> 06:41.740]  where I am. I could be on the International Space Station and the universe could see fit to put a
[06:41.740 --> 06:45.840]  snake in front of me if it wanted to. Last week, I could have said it's probably been a decade
[06:45.840 --> 06:52.020]  since I'd seen a snake. But I did see one this week. Really? A dead, obliterated snake. Are you
[06:52.020 --> 06:58.060]  serious? Yeah, his head was all smashed up. Oh, thank God. Where was it? It was right outside my
[06:58.060 --> 07:05.360]  house. It was probably coming to get you. Someone intervened. Somebody saved your life. That snake
[07:05.360 --> 07:08.900]  might have been... that snake might have been hired. It might have been a snake assassin. It
[07:08.900 --> 07:13.300]  might have been minutes away from ending your life and somebody drove over it and fucking...
[07:16.360 --> 07:22.440]  How would a snake get... would it come up a drain? What's the easiest way to get in as a snake?
[07:22.660 --> 07:30.360]  Toilet. Drain. Any hole. It doesn't care. Snake's gonna find a way in, man. Toilet snake. Yeah.
[07:31.220 --> 07:36.420]  I don't trust it. I don't trust a snake in space. Chimney. I've got a different animal that's got in.
[07:36.980 --> 07:45.160]  What? My, uh, my office bog has a ceiling full of squirrels. What? What? Excuse me? What?
[07:46.200 --> 07:50.080]  Yeah, whenever I'm shitting, I can hear him, like, eating the ceiling and, like, tearing up the
[07:50.700 --> 08:00.900]  insulation and stuff. Have you called anyone? No. No. I just... How long?
[08:01.680 --> 08:05.680]  Oh, it's been probably a month. I just, uh... Oh my God! I've got this habit of just throwing...
[08:05.680 --> 08:10.340]  throwing a tissue box at the ceiling every time I pick it up so they shut up.
[08:10.800 --> 08:16.200]  So it's done a month's worth of damage while you've sat on your ass doing nothing to stop it?
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.180]  Yeah. Honestly, I thought the fact that they're already in,
[08:19.680 --> 08:24.700]  I just assumed the damage was unfathomable. And they're probably all over the house.
[08:25.500 --> 08:29.420]  So rather than stop them, you did nothing? He's allowing them to advance.
[08:29.420 --> 08:31.300]  I threw a tissue box. I just told you.
[08:36.380 --> 08:39.340]  I can... I can send you a video of what it sounds like.
[08:40.060 --> 08:42.300]  I don't know how I'm going to do it without Nitro.
[08:43.860 --> 08:49.020]  I also don't know how I'm going to find the video because my camera roll is full of blueprints
[08:49.020 --> 08:58.580]  pictures. Totally wrecked my camera roll. Once we get past this fascinating saga that I don't
[08:58.580 --> 09:01.220]  want to get off of anytime soon, I do have more bike stuff.
[09:02.540 --> 09:08.620]  Well, I just want, I think Gavin should start redecorating for his squirrel bathroom
[09:08.620 --> 09:12.380]  in those pictures that I sent. Just go full squirrel, welcome them.
[09:13.000 --> 09:16.260]  Yeah, this is this is there. And then there's one squirrel with a plunger.
[09:16.280 --> 09:19.980]  This is great. This is helpful. They're here to help.
[09:20.640 --> 09:22.140]  He's living reverse mousetrap.
[09:25.330 --> 09:29.530]  You should start assigning them tasks to do around the house and shores.
[09:30.330 --> 09:35.090]  They're just really going for it. You can hear how violent they are with the stuff up there.
[09:35.390 --> 09:38.550]  Well, they're probably multiplying and oh my God, dude.
[09:40.090 --> 09:43.210]  Yeah. Are you gonna call somebody?
[09:44.490 --> 09:46.290]  Yeah. When?
[09:47.150 --> 09:52.950]  I have a problem with people in that no one ever calls me back or emails me back if I'm like,
[09:53.270 --> 09:58.030]  hey, I need a electrician. I'll send an email to like three companies and no one ever replies.
[09:58.590 --> 10:04.070]  Dude. Dude, I got my dishwasher fixed this morning before we started recording.
[10:04.330 --> 10:09.030]  It has been a four month saga getting it fixed just because of getting people to
[10:09.030 --> 10:13.430]  return calls. You are not wrong, Gav. It is impossible. It's demoralizing.
[10:14.770 --> 10:20.270]  I'm just thinking about your entire rooster teeth run and none of the emails you replied to.
[10:33.990 --> 10:38.990]  I feel like we were not replying for different reasons. People want the business.
[10:47.750 --> 10:50.010]  Oh, God damn. That's awesome.
[10:51.670 --> 10:52.810]  Oh, man.
[10:53.750 --> 10:54.870]  That's a valid point.
[10:56.990 --> 11:01.210]  I've decided on my ride yesterday morning that Austin is officially a big city.
[11:02.650 --> 11:08.350]  And you can mark it by the fact that at 730 in the morning, the entire city smells like hot piss.
[11:10.190 --> 11:18.270]  Everywhere I went was just people pissing. Drunk people piss smells. Unhoused people piss smells.
[11:18.590 --> 11:24.390]  Runners, you know, can't hold it and pop off the trail piss smells. Everywhere you go in
[11:24.390 --> 11:28.770]  the morning on a humid morning smells like piss. So we are officially like,
[11:29.250 --> 11:32.910]  New York City smells like hot shit and piss. We don't have the shit smell,
[11:33.070 --> 11:36.810]  but we definitely are over indexing on piss this day, which got me thinking, right?
[11:37.150 --> 11:40.910]  I noticed it immediately. I was like, oh, fuck, people have pissed here. That's a lot.
[11:41.370 --> 11:48.690]  You take it for granted that we piss in toilets now, but for almost the entirety of recorded
[11:48.690 --> 11:53.170]  human history, it must have smelled worse than Austin smelled when I was riding my bike yesterday
[11:53.170 --> 11:58.470]  morning because piss and shit was everywhere and we weren't clean and we had outhouses and then you
[11:58.470 --> 12:02.770]  would take all your piss and shit from from under your bed and the bowls that you would hold it in
[12:02.770 --> 12:06.550]  it overnight and you would throw it out the window onto the fucking street down below in the morning
[12:06.550 --> 12:12.930]  and the canals would run with piss and shit until about 150 years ago. Earth must have
[12:12.930 --> 12:19.290]  smelled horrible. Humans must have constantly encountered the smell of acrid, stale piss
[12:19.290 --> 12:26.010]  everywhere they went. I assume it smelled like a zoo. Yeah, it must have, right? I mean, nothing
[12:26.010 --> 12:30.750]  was pissier than working downtown, though, on Congress. Some of those alleyways, jeez,
[12:30.770 --> 12:36.370]  like going from parking to the office. It's a shit obstacle course. Pissy alleyways are small
[12:36.370 --> 12:40.310]  city problems. It's when the piss makes its way to the main thoroughfares, that's when you know
[12:40.310 --> 12:45.750]  you've really hit the big time. Rural piss. Yeah. Goddamn. I mean, like, you're right. Think about
[12:45.750 --> 12:49.910]  like entire human history. Everything is all outdoor. And then like the last 100 years,
[12:50.010 --> 12:53.470]  imagine somebody came to you and they're like, yeah, so that thing that's outside that you go
[12:53.470 --> 12:58.610]  and you fucking stink up like crazy. We're going to put that like connected to your bedroom. It's
[12:58.610 --> 13:03.530]  going to be inside your house now. And then you just go, you're going to what? Huh? Like, there's
[13:03.530 --> 13:10.730]  no way it made any sense the first time somebody pitched it, right? Yeah. It's insane. It's weird.
[13:10.730 --> 13:19.430]  Humanity was disgusting until about 125, 150 years ago, I'd say. The next observation I had
[13:19.430 --> 13:26.850]  is that coffee shops in Austin are multiplying like gremlins. There is a new coffee shop on
[13:26.850 --> 13:32.670]  every corner of the city every week. It's fucking crazy. I know we're currently either done with
[13:32.670 --> 13:36.770]  filming Good Morning Gustavo or between seasons, so we're not going to them all. But goddamn,
[13:36.770 --> 13:44.290]  Eric, have you noticed this or is it just me? No, yeah, they're everywhere. A lot. New ones
[13:44.290 --> 13:49.590]  that I'd never seen before just keep popping up. And I like, again, this isn't a complaint. I think
[13:49.590 --> 13:57.130]  it's great to have more of that stuff. But boy, it feels like after COVID, it was like ramping up.
[13:57.170 --> 14:04.610]  And then now it's like, hey, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. It's a lot. It's breakneck right now.
[14:04.610 --> 14:09.650]  I probably saw four yesterday on my bike ride that didn't exist a month ago. Just like, yeah,
[14:09.710 --> 14:13.630]  every time you turn around, it's like tattoo shops were in the 90s and early 2000s here.
[14:14.030 --> 14:18.570]  Do you think coffee shop owners have all colluded to try and keep Good Morning Gustavo going as long
[14:18.570 --> 14:24.350]  as possible? Yeah, they've tried, but we're going to break them. I swear to God. We'll see.
[14:27.030 --> 14:33.270]  Then I had two other things from the bike ride. Well, sorry, before you move on,
[14:33.270 --> 14:36.890]  have you considered going to these coffee shops and asking why?
[14:37.970 --> 14:45.730]  Hi. Hi. I was just riding my bike. Why? Why? Why did you choose to do this? There's a shop down
[14:45.730 --> 14:51.830]  the street. There's a shop across the street. Yeah. Why? I can see three coffee shops from
[14:51.830 --> 14:58.290]  the deck of your coffee shop. Why? Why? I think it's fair. I'd love to know why. I mean,
[14:58.290 --> 15:01.270]  it must be demand, right? Because they're all fucking crowded.
[15:02.150 --> 15:06.930]  Because you'll pay any amount of money for coffee. I think that's what it boils down to.
[15:07.390 --> 15:11.670]  I would love to ask why in different shops and see if anyone actually answers a question.
[15:12.710 --> 15:16.030]  Whether they would say why what. Maybe you should start doing that.
[15:16.370 --> 15:18.530]  So just walk in and say why and then just see what they say?
[15:19.010 --> 15:23.170]  I think I should say, can I ask you a question first? So they expect something.
[15:23.510 --> 15:24.510]  Okay. Okay.
[15:24.750 --> 15:27.390]  And they don't think I'm trying to order something.
[15:28.170 --> 15:30.730]  Okay. And then you just say, and then you just say why?
[15:34.250 --> 15:37.870]  Hi, can I ask you a question? Oh, wow. Are you the guy from Slow Mo Guys? Yeah. I'll be asking
[15:37.870 --> 15:43.670]  the questions around here. Why? And then they, then they're flummoxed. I like it.
[15:43.870 --> 15:48.690]  And they go, I'm so, I'm so glad you asked. We are big believers in cheese. So we decided to
[15:48.690 --> 15:53.910]  open up an artisanal cheese shop that you have locked into. And it's our life passion,
[15:54.490 --> 15:58.090]  making and selling different cheeses from the world. And this is why.
[15:58.630 --> 16:04.290]  I think potentially I could, uh, as I say, why I could shrug my shoulders a little bit with my
[16:04.830 --> 16:08.770]  hands pointed up and maybe just like gesture around at the ceiling and walls and stuff.
[16:09.710 --> 16:10.590]  That might help.
[16:14.270 --> 16:19.350]  I just, I just imagined Gavin walking. Like you don't have the guts. That's very exciting to hear.
[16:19.430 --> 16:24.190]  You don't have the guts. You don't have the fucking guts to do it. But I really love the
[16:24.190 --> 16:28.750]  idea of Gavin walking in and saying, why I'm scared to talk to anyone who I've known for less
[16:28.750 --> 16:36.090]  than six months. You're only just now sort of talking to my wife. And it's mostly about the
[16:36.090 --> 16:41.830]  moon. And it's like, so I just, Oh God, I would love to see this happen. You would have to be
[16:41.830 --> 16:48.230]  in pressure. He's a month into getting up the courage to call about an infestation in his
[16:48.230 --> 16:54.870]  ceiling for Christ's sake. Do you want to listen to this video? If you give it just a second,
[16:55.010 --> 17:00.230]  I'm uploading it to discord. Something that it seems like you could have done.
[17:00.630 --> 17:07.350]  I don't have nitro. Do I have nitro? Yeah. Oh, hell yeah. Hey guys, check this out. I have nitro.
[17:08.030 --> 17:12.570]  Wait, why don't you just get nitro then? I would, I have to wait for you to give me permission.
[17:13.290 --> 17:19.160]  Okay. Get nitro. Okay. Oh my God.
[17:20.760 --> 17:36.830]  What time of day is it? Oh my God. What? Oh my God. Shut up. Dude, you're bog, you're like,
[17:36.890 --> 17:42.350]  you're bog roll whipping, dude. Yeah. I throw a bog roll. Cause it's just so loud. I can't
[17:42.350 --> 17:50.730]  concentrate. Wow. You gotta get that fixed immediately. You can't let that go out of
[17:50.730 --> 17:56.270]  control. That's bad. I just wish anyone anywhere would return a call or email me.
[17:56.570 --> 18:03.070]  Get the squirrels out of my fricking ceiling. And that's not even, not even my main squirrel
[18:03.070 --> 18:08.870]  problem. I've got them stuffing my fricking guys with my beard still. My whole grill is full of a
[18:08.870 --> 18:19.910]  squirrel nest. It's bollocks. Did I send you the video for my grill? No. I'll keep filling for a
[18:19.910 --> 18:26.710]  bit. You just said that your, you said that your gutters are filled with your hair and now your
[18:26.710 --> 18:32.630]  grill is filled with squirrel stuff. Yeah. So the area that I shaved, uh, just put my beard down
[18:33.010 --> 18:41.230]  and then the squirrels nick my beard and put it in my rain gutters. So now water just spills over
[18:41.230 --> 18:48.630]  them onto the door frames and stuff. Are you sure that's not birds? No, I mean it's squirrels and
[18:48.630 --> 18:55.970]  birds. Oh wow. Changing his tune. This is why they won't call you back, dude. Guys like, so what is
[18:55.970 --> 18:59.950]  it? Is it squirrels or is it birds? What are you, what am I supposed to do here? The squirrels steal
[18:59.950 --> 19:06.450]  my couch cushion stuffing and mix it with my beard and the birds just take the beard. Yeah.
[19:06.690 --> 19:11.010]  We had squirrel, we have the same problem with squirrels ripping out our cushions.
[19:11.530 --> 19:15.590]  They're little fuckers, man. They completely dismantled a floor mat outside.
[19:19.510 --> 19:24.690]  I think we've all been there before. Booking a doctor appointment can just feel so daunting.
[19:25.190 --> 19:29.070]  It can be a massive headache to just start the process. It can feel incredibly daunting,

[22:29.790 --> 22:38.950]  Woo! They could be your killers, Geoff. You know, there was an update actually on the subreddit
[22:38.950 --> 22:44.090]  from a wildlife biologist who said, Geoff's serial killer, a wildlife biologist perspective.
[22:44.910 --> 22:50.210]  They said, I think he nailed it with Raccoon. The first time he said he found a bird without a head,
[22:50.290 --> 22:54.530]  I was guessing Raccoon. Why? Because they're assholes. They're known to eat only the parts
[22:54.530 --> 22:59.810]  of things they kill and they'll kill even for fun. This is by bleepbloop3008.
[23:02.750 --> 23:07.950]  But how birds, you ask? Raccoons are nocturnal. Birds sleep at night. Sleeping birds are much
[23:07.950 --> 23:13.610]  easier to catch. And then they tell a story about how they used to catch ducks in these traps so that
[23:13.610 --> 23:17.830]  they could tag them. And sometimes raccoons will come along and see the ducks trapped in the cages
[23:17.830 --> 23:24.390]  and they'll just go snap their necks for fun. Jesus! Oh my god. Yeah. And then somebody else
[23:24.390 --> 23:27.330]  in the comments was like, I'm pretty sure it's probably a cat. I really don't think so. I haven't,
[23:27.690 --> 23:30.970]  none of my neighbors have cats and I have never seen a cat in my yard. I feel like if there was
[23:30.970 --> 23:34.730]  that much murder going on in my yard, I would at least see the cat hanging out from time to time.
[23:35.490 --> 23:38.670]  I think that's true. Is that enough vamp for you, Geoff? Yeah, I mean, when are we showing this,
[23:38.830 --> 23:45.770]  when are we showing, when are we seeing your squirrel grill? Nitro, come on! It'll take me a
[23:46.330 --> 23:51.090]  Yeah, drop a couple blueprints photos in here to hold us over, bud. He has to upload it to Eric
[23:51.090 --> 23:57.250]  so that then Eric can upload it to us. On the trail yesterday, I saw something quite shocking,
[23:57.390 --> 24:01.690]  if I'm being honest with you. On one end of the trail that I take, it's like an 11 mile loop
[24:01.690 --> 24:07.090]  essentially, or 10 and a half mile loop. And on one end by the dam over on the east, far east
[24:07.090 --> 24:11.750]  side of Austin, there's a lot of crazy people on the trail because we're a big city now,
[24:11.750 --> 24:16.050]  we have big city problems, and there's a lot of like aggressive, crazy people. And so I'm always
[24:16.050 --> 24:20.270]  having to keep a lookout, right? Because a couple months ago, there was a dude at Auditorium Shores
[24:20.270 --> 24:25.470]  and Zilker Park with a machete hacking people up. Oh my god. Almost cut somebody's arm off,
[24:25.490 --> 24:28.790]  and it was like at two in the afternoon. So I try to pay attention on my bike, you know,
[24:28.810 --> 24:34.270]  so I don't get macheted. And I saw a new one, I saw a dude who looked like he lived on the
[24:34.270 --> 24:39.530]  on the trail, pretty, pretty wild eyed. And he was walking around with never seen this one before,
[24:39.530 --> 24:45.130]  a hockey stick as a weapon. And I thought, wow, there's a first time for everything. Like,
[24:45.130 --> 24:49.490]  I never even crossed my mind. We're not a big hockey town in Austin, you know,
[24:49.850 --> 24:55.830]  but with the excessive heat and no ice and stuff. And I've just never seen a hockey stick in the
[24:55.830 --> 24:58.670]  wild like that. And I thought, wow, that's really interesting. You don't see that every day.
[24:59.070 --> 25:06.090]  Then an hour later on the exact opposite side of Town Lake, where over by Barton Springs,
[25:06.090 --> 25:12.590]  I ran into a dude, a different dude with a hockey stick walking the trail. What?
[25:13.450 --> 25:19.450]  I know, right? What is happening? Does that mean there's some sort of a hockey rivalry going on?
[25:19.890 --> 25:23.290]  Like one guy's got like, this is my side of the trail. And the other guy's like, this is my side
[25:23.290 --> 25:30.310]  of the trail. Or is there some sort of a like crazy person hockey league, field hockey league
[25:30.310 --> 25:35.250]  that they're doing? Did somebody break into and steal a bunch of hockey equipment from an academy
[25:35.250 --> 25:41.030]  and it made its way down to the trail? Like out of the blue, I've seen two hockey sticks to be
[25:41.030 --> 25:46.190]  used as, I assume, weapons on the trail on different... These guys were six miles apart.
[25:46.670 --> 25:48.850]  You think it's viral marketing for the ice bats?
[25:49.070 --> 25:53.670]  It could be viral marketing for our local hockey team, the Austin Ice Bats,
[25:53.810 --> 25:59.450]  but I don't think so. I think it's the weird... Let me know if you guys see any people out there
[25:59.450 --> 26:03.750]  swinging hockey sticks, because apparently it's a thing now. Okay, that's nice. Eric,
[26:03.750 --> 26:08.250]  thank you for uploading Gavin's video. Dude, nope. Honestly, guy like me? No problem. I got that.
[26:09.610 --> 26:13.450]  All right. This is a three and a half minute video, which I assume we're not watching all of.
[26:13.650 --> 26:14.390]  Yeah, we're in a grill.
[26:15.290 --> 26:16.650]  What are we looking at, Gavin?
[26:16.750 --> 26:17.210]  I hear rattling.
[26:17.490 --> 26:17.650]  My grill.
[26:17.810 --> 26:18.770]  Oh my God.
[26:20.030 --> 26:22.410]  Wait, you have a camera inside your grill?
[26:22.950 --> 26:27.110]  Well, I went to grill something, right? And it was full of a bunch of twigs and
[26:27.110 --> 26:32.230]  sticks and my beard and the couch cushion scared the shit out of me.
[26:36.020 --> 26:39.820]  And we don't have to watch anymore on that, but that's what that's the case with. So I thought,
[26:39.940 --> 26:42.140]  oh, squirrels done this. I'll put a camera in there.
[26:42.480 --> 26:44.880]  Can we put these on social media? These are very funny videos.
[26:45.260 --> 26:46.000]  What the hell?
[26:46.600 --> 26:51.680]  Dude, I'm about... I jumped a minute 45 in. Squirrels back, looking. Oh, dude,
[26:51.700 --> 26:55.500]  he's like right at the camera. Oh, dude, he's attacking. Oh, he's attacking the camera.
[26:55.820 --> 26:56.760]  He doesn't like the camera.
[26:56.980 --> 26:58.540]  Oh, and then he puts his ass in the camera.
[26:58.560 --> 26:59.500]  Yeah, he's going at it.
[26:59.500 --> 27:00.380]  Dude, what the hell?
[27:00.540 --> 27:01.960]  Holy shit, yeah, it's wild!
[27:01.960 --> 27:05.680]  I didn't remove the stuff because I thought maybe he's going to put baby squirrels in there,
[27:05.720 --> 27:07.600]  but he never did. Then this was like three months ago.
[27:08.100 --> 27:09.500]  Yeah, dude, this is crazy.
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.620]  You know what you can do if you want to handle it real fast?
[27:13.320 --> 27:16.340]  Just pop the top open, throw some lighter fluid on that and light it.
[27:17.900 --> 27:20.000]  Why would I use lighter fluid when I can just turn the grill on?
[27:20.500 --> 27:21.560]  Oh, I guess it is a gas grill.
[27:24.460 --> 27:27.200]  I don't have a gas grill. I'm not a gas grill guy.
[27:27.200 --> 27:31.820]  I tied a rag around the handle just to remind me not to turn it on without throwing that out first.
[27:39.850 --> 27:45.950]  The last thing I thought of on my bike ride, I wanted to ask you guys a question.
[27:46.510 --> 27:51.830]  While I was riding around and I was watching, it was like maybe 7.15, 7.30 and I was downtown
[27:51.830 --> 27:56.550]  and everybody was going to work. They were like dudes with uncomfortable shoes,
[27:56.550 --> 28:03.190]  you know, like patent leather shoes with like thin socks and suits carrying briefcases and
[28:03.190 --> 28:08.430]  everybody's very smartly dressed and nobody looks happy and their hair is all slicked back or clothed
[28:08.430 --> 28:12.310]  or whatever and they're all going into tall buildings to spend all day in the tall buildings
[28:12.310 --> 28:20.330]  and I was on my bicycle and I got hit with the biggest wave of this nostalgic feeling of playing
[28:20.330 --> 28:25.410]  hooky like when I was 10 or 11 and you play hooky and you'd see all the grown-ups, you know, going
[28:25.410 --> 28:29.490]  about their day and you were like fucking free to do whatever you wanted to and I'm, you know,
[28:29.590 --> 28:35.070]  49 years old. Obviously, it's ridiculous but the feeling was so palpable it was like I was 12 years
[28:35.070 --> 28:40.010]  old again and I got to thinking this is like the best fucking feeling in the world. The feeling
[28:40.010 --> 28:44.970]  of getting to play hooky which made me think two things. One, I want to propose something to you
[28:44.970 --> 28:52.450]  guys. I propose that one day a year we get to call hooky and then we all go do stuff together.
[28:52.450 --> 28:56.850]  We go to like a movie or we all get online and play video games that we're not recording
[28:57.410 --> 29:01.070]  or we go for a bike ride or however we want to present it and do it. Maybe we
[29:02.310 --> 29:04.810]  figure out a way that we're, you know, because we're not all in the same location that we can
[29:05.150 --> 29:08.570]  make it all work but just one day a year we get to call hooky and we all get to play hooky together.
[29:08.750 --> 29:13.570]  I think that would be so fun. That's great. Yeah, like, oh, we're gonna go to Six Flags today or
[29:13.570 --> 29:17.870]  whatever, you know. So we all get one hooky per year or something? I think it would just be one
[29:17.870 --> 29:24.430]  for all of us. Okay. But I'm open to five hookys because that's five times the fun, you know.
[29:26.430 --> 29:31.390]  But the other thought I had was what are the other best feelings in the world? Not sexual,
[29:31.510 --> 29:36.890]  of course, not weird, but like that feeling of hooky was so fun and it felt so good. And then
[29:36.890 --> 29:41.830]  I thought about how we celebrate 5.01 p.m. on a Friday because it's the best time of the week.
[29:41.830 --> 29:48.170]  So what are the other like best feelings in the world? I love the feeling of I'm having a very
[29:48.170 --> 29:53.170]  stressful dream about like an exam or some bullshit from my past and then I wake up and
[29:53.170 --> 29:57.730]  it's not real. Yeah, that's a good one. And I'm just like, oh, I don't even have to get up for
[29:57.730 --> 30:06.270]  anything. I don't have to go to school. I don't have to know algebra. When you have that list of
[30:06.270 --> 30:12.070]  a million small things you get done and you knock off like all of it and then you sit down
[30:12.070 --> 30:17.670]  when it's done and you go, I don't have to think that stuff that's just been taking up brain space
[30:17.670 --> 30:23.330]  for like weeks. It's all done. And I don't ever have to think about any of that stuff again. It's
[30:23.330 --> 30:29.050]  done. It's all done. Finishing that list is so nice. That's a great one, Eric. That is a fucking
[30:29.050 --> 30:34.770]  great one. For sure. For me, similar to Gavin, having a dream where you're trying to get home
[30:34.770 --> 30:40.390]  and you can't and like it's just you're struggling to like get there or you're on the wrong bus or
[30:40.390 --> 30:45.090]  there's some big obstacle and then realizing you're in a dream and can just wake up and you'll
[30:45.090 --> 30:52.590]  be home. Oh, it's good. Wake up all cozy in the bed. Yeah. Teleport. Yeah. A good shit.
[30:54.830 --> 30:59.670]  The shit that's been really sitting in you and making you uncomfortable for a while. Blast it
[30:59.670 --> 31:05.730]  out. You're talking about waking up from a dream or whatever when you wake up in the middle of the
[31:05.730 --> 31:09.430]  night, not like a startle, whatever. You're just like, oh, man, I got to go do this. I got to
[31:09.430 --> 31:12.590]  wake up at like a certain time or whatever. And you roll over and you look at the clock and it's
[31:12.590 --> 31:18.450]  like three ten a.m. And you're like, I don't have to be up for another four or five, whatever it is
[31:18.450 --> 31:23.130]  like you just have that amount of time. You think you only get 30 more minutes of sleep. You roll
[31:23.130 --> 31:26.510]  over. You see the time. You're like, I have six more hours to sleep. This is great. You roll back
[31:26.510 --> 31:32.170]  over. Oh, it's the best. It's the best. That can go the other way. Oh, yeah, that can be a
[31:32.170 --> 31:36.590]  negative. I've had times where like I'll wake up and I'll feel like, oh, I'm awake. And then I'll
[31:36.590 --> 31:40.490]  realize, oh, I got five more hours of sleep or three more. I can sleep and then I'll wake up
[31:40.490 --> 31:45.270]  more tired somehow on the other end of the three hours than I did when I initially woke up. Oh,
[31:45.270 --> 31:51.330]  dude, I don't know what you mean. Whoa. I get that totally. I when I was like 13,
[31:51.330 --> 31:59.170]  I got an alarm clock and I one night I woke up at like, I don't know, one in the morning to take
[31:59.170 --> 32:02.430]  a piss. And I thought it was like four. And I saw that it was only one. And I was like, oh,
[32:02.450 --> 32:05.710]  my God, I get like five extra hours of sleep. And that next morning I felt like I'd gotten
[32:05.710 --> 32:11.310]  double sleep. So I started setting my alarm for like two, one or two in the morning so that I
[32:11.310 --> 32:15.550]  could wake up and see that it was one or two in the morning and then go back to sleep because I
[32:15.550 --> 32:20.350]  briefly thought that it would make me sleep better. Did not. Did not. I stopped doing it pretty
[32:20.350 --> 32:24.990]  quickly, but I probably did it like four days in a row. Geoff, I did that for like two months.
[32:25.090 --> 32:31.610]  Did you really? Yeah. Mathematically, it made sense. Are you serious? You're not talking about
[32:31.610 --> 32:38.030]  just having a new kid. You actually did that. Yeah. I set an alarm for 1 a.m., got extra sleep.
[32:39.350 --> 32:44.050]  I just remember feeling so refreshed that day and being like, it like doubled my sleep somehow. I
[32:44.050 --> 32:47.810]  gotta try this again. And then I get every day. It was like it didn't work last night. I don't
[32:47.810 --> 32:53.470]  know what I did differently. Nick calling it extra sleep is so crazy. Yeah. Well, I was thinking
[32:53.470 --> 32:57.310]  you enjoy, you know, that good night's sleep so much. What if you did it twice in the same night?
[32:57.410 --> 33:02.370]  Exactly. What if you did it five times? Yeah. At what point does it become bad sleep? You'd
[33:02.370 --> 33:06.190]  be hibernating. Well, a sleep cycle is almost like four hours, isn't it? Like a full one?
[33:06.650 --> 33:11.430]  I think so. So as long as you do four and four, it's probably the same as getting eight.
[33:12.750 --> 33:15.170]  I don't know how sleep works. I'm not sure anyone does. I think everyone's
[33:15.170 --> 33:19.830]  shit with sleep. Yeah. It doesn't matter. You need to do it to make any sense.
[33:20.390 --> 33:24.310]  Once again, my relationship to how I feel in the morning when I wake up bears no
[33:25.430 --> 33:30.450]  resemblance to what my aura ring tells me my sleep was like. Like I'm fucking exhausted and
[33:30.450 --> 33:33.750]  it's like, no, dude, you had the best night of sleep of your life. Or I wake up and I'm like,
[33:33.810 --> 33:38.050]  oh, I feel fucking great. Nope. You don't feel great at all. You got a 72 percent sleep last
[33:38.050 --> 33:41.890]  night. You had a 20 percent drop off dickhead. Yeah. You wake up feeling refreshed. It's like,
[33:41.890 --> 33:44.470]  what was going on with your heart last night? Jesus.
[33:46.310 --> 33:48.970]  Gavin, if you could opt out of sleep entirely, would you?
[33:49.770 --> 33:57.530]  Oh, yeah. Really? Big time. I take no pleasure in it. I want to teleport from night to morning.
[33:58.570 --> 34:04.550]  Oh, man, I love it. It's fun. The waking up is fun. Yeah, but I just get I spend I
[34:04.550 --> 34:09.290]  waste so much time trying to sleep. That's fair. That's a good point.
[34:09.290 --> 34:14.470]  I like waking up and just events happened in the world and just being able to see,
[34:14.570 --> 34:18.070]  like, oh, what's going on? What happened? I was out. I wasn't present for a while.
[34:18.930 --> 34:22.810]  It is nice that when you go to sleep, when you wake up, you know, Reddit is refreshed a little
[34:22.810 --> 34:36.040]  bit. Are you guys going to boo boo in this weekend? No. OK, that's all the thing that
[34:36.040 --> 34:41.600]  happens every weekend now that I can't get Gavin to go with me and his wife and Emily and whoever.
[34:41.620 --> 34:47.960]  Vanessa, I just Kristen went last weekend. Do you go every week? I'm going this weekend and
[34:47.960 --> 34:54.640]  went last weekend, so I guess so. And it's just so that there's like an extra slot to buy something
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.120]  because they're limited per customer to get their little monster things. Yeah. Purse charms or
[35:00.120 --> 35:04.240]  whatever they are. I just don't I just don't know how much time I want to dedicate to the latest
[35:05.880 --> 35:09.760]  landfill craze. Yeah. I mean, I mean, zero is probably like the right amount.
[35:09.760 --> 35:15.720]  I don't know. It's fun. It's like he's goofing around and hanging out in the worst lines,
[35:15.880 --> 35:20.460]  the worst organized sales you've ever seen in your entire life. It is amazing how bad
[35:20.460 --> 35:26.280]  some people are at stuff. Is that your pitch? Is that you just you just went like, it's great.
[35:26.420 --> 35:36.140]  Oh, I got there was free. I got a free donut and some soda as well. You did get a pretty fancy
[35:36.140 --> 35:40.740]  donut. It was delicious. And I don't know. I just like hanging out with people doing stuff,
[35:40.940 --> 35:46.600]  you know, something different, hanging out. But if I'm lining up with friends, I want I want to be
[35:46.600 --> 35:51.780]  excited about the thing I'm lining up for. But they're so excited. I enjoy their enthusiasm,
[35:52.160 --> 35:57.840]  you know? Oh, I don't get like they're they're on cloud nine. They couldn't be happier. They
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.720]  race to the car to rip open the boxes and see what color their little fucking stuffed animal is.
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.380]  And I don't know. It's fun to watch them be happy and excited about stuff.
[36:06.820 --> 36:12.760]  I get into other people's joy. Yeah, that's fair. And it's only going to last like another two weeks
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.640]  before they move on to something else. So I just, you know, enjoy it while it's around.
[36:17.240 --> 36:21.920]  Yeah, I just standing out in the heat for ages. Just I just feel like shit.
[36:24.500 --> 36:28.100]  We did spend a lot of time making fun of you specifically for not doing it.
[36:28.100 --> 36:30.860]  I bet. I'm not good at that.
[36:32.320 --> 36:39.060]  If I was in control of a toy company, it would be a like when Blockbuster could have bought Netflix
[36:39.620 --> 36:44.580]  for Lububu with me because I don't get it. Like if somebody showed me Lububu, I'd be like,
[36:44.600 --> 36:48.920]  we don't need to make these. Nobody wants these. It's the biggest toy craze ever.
[36:49.640 --> 36:53.860]  Yeah, honestly, skip this one. Yeah, we just pass on this.
[36:54.480 --> 36:59.900]  It is one of those things that it connects with people in a way that it doesn't with me,
[37:00.020 --> 37:04.820]  and I can't quite see it. But I find that in itself to be kind of fascinating and appealing,
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.380]  you know? Yeah, that's totally fair.
[37:07.500 --> 37:13.100]  Like they see something in that deal that I don't like. I don't think it's cute in the way they do,
[37:13.160 --> 37:19.720]  but they lose their fucking minds. Like, oh, my God. Emily spends an hour a night when she gets
[37:19.720 --> 37:25.060]  home from work watching TikToks of Makoko, whatever the fuck that is. I don't. I don't.
[37:25.160 --> 37:31.840]  It's a Lububu. Oh, Makoko is a Lububu? Makoko is a Lububu. It is a Lububu.
[37:33.640 --> 37:38.440]  Guys, if you're listening to this, Makoko is a Lububu. If you feel like you're having a stroke,
[37:38.520 --> 37:43.160]  you're not. Simply put, Makoko is a Lububu. I'm pretty sure the other one isn't a Lububu,
[37:43.240 --> 37:48.940]  the one with the tail. But the Makoko is, even though it's got the heart nose. But it's like
[37:48.940 --> 37:56.460]  the princess or the mom or the fairy or something. They're little elves, right? And the Makoko is
[37:56.460 --> 38:02.600]  one of them, but also elevated in some way. I don't know. It's complicated. I'm going throwback
[38:02.600 --> 38:07.560]  with some collectible stuff. This comes out in July. Peanuts Tamagotchi Snoopy. Oh, that's so
[38:07.560 --> 38:14.960]  cool. Oh, isn't that awesome? I don't care about this at all. I want it because the little NES
[38:14.960 --> 38:20.420]  looking graphics on the bottom where it's like it's Snoopy and then he's Safari Snoopy and Pirate
[38:20.420 --> 38:25.360]  Snoopy and Joe Cool and all that stuff. I'm like, dude, I'm I'm dressing my Snoopy up. I can't wait
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.620]  for this thing. I'm bummed that Tamagotchi technology didn't really advance beyond this
[38:29.620 --> 38:38.660]  first few iterations. What do you want from it? Yeah, that looks like 1994. I think that's part
[38:38.660 --> 38:45.060]  of the charm. I like the NES. Yeah, I like the NES. If that if that was like high res Snoopy's,
[38:45.080 --> 38:49.080]  I wouldn't be as interested as like the NES looking Snoopy's. Yeah. You know what I mean?
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.700]  Yeah. Like, look at that one on the way. He's like wearing like a little hat.
[38:53.080 --> 38:56.580]  It's pretty exciting. He's like a man of mystery. That's Snoopy.
[38:58.920 --> 39:04.760]  There's something about how simple it looks that like taps into childhood for me.
[39:05.280 --> 39:10.100]  Like if it was cleaner or crisper, like it wouldn't hit the same. There's something
[39:10.920 --> 39:18.180]  I yeah, childish about the way I've been. I switched my Apple TV screensavers to Snoopy
[39:18.180 --> 39:23.500]  and I'm enjoying the extra HD Snoopy adventures happening on my telly.
[39:23.700 --> 39:28.060]  I got to get an Apple TV just for that. I don't have Apple TV. I think I might have to get one
[39:28.060 --> 39:32.260]  just to watch the Snoopy screensavers and not subscribe to anything. Do you have a watch?
[39:32.260 --> 39:36.120]  No. I guess I should switch to those. Are they they're entertaining?
[39:36.700 --> 39:39.920]  Oh, I love them. Yeah, they're great. He's probably getting into all kinds of trouble.
[39:40.020 --> 39:42.620]  He's probably hanging out with Woodstock. He's probably flying around in his
[39:42.620 --> 39:45.120]  doghouse. Yeah. He's like fighting the Red Baron dude.
[39:45.680 --> 39:49.180]  Snoopy's trying to have a little kip on his doghouse and Woodstock just pissed him off.
[39:50.540 --> 39:53.260]  It's great. I think at the end of the day, though,
[39:54.860 --> 40:01.420]  you're just the aesthetic of your childhood is forever imprinted on you, you know? And so it'll
[40:01.420 --> 40:07.080]  always appeal to you. But I always do appreciate a remaster. Like if I'm going to go back and play
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.680]  Halo 2 now, I'm definitely playing with new graphics. Well, yeah, I'm not. I'm not playing
[40:10.680 --> 40:18.240]  the old Oblivion, that's for sure. But like if the screensaver, the Snoopy screensaver was
[40:18.240 --> 40:22.060]  a Tamagotchi in a way where you had to feed him or die or whatever, I would be into it.
[40:22.780 --> 40:27.000]  Yeah, I think they're just I think like playing a game like that would be fun. There's just the
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.860]  nostalgia of giant head, tiny body Snoopy that looks like little block graphics that I really
[40:32.860 --> 40:37.480]  enjoy. But I think I would enjoy the Apple TV screensavers just as much. I got to.
[40:37.900 --> 40:41.500]  Do I have to subscribe to anything to get that or can they just give it to me?
[40:41.740 --> 40:45.020]  No, but I tell you what, though, we should just I'll bring my Apple TV to the office
[40:45.020 --> 40:48.640]  and we can just put it on our telly. Oh, that's what I'm talking about. Kanga TV
[40:48.640 --> 40:52.200]  next to Andrew's watchful eye and then I can just watch Snoopy screensavers.
[40:52.560 --> 40:55.520]  We can watch that instead of reruns of Wipeout over and over again.
[40:55.520 --> 41:01.800]  Yeah, because they look like dog shit. Dude, they look bad on our 90 inch TV.
[41:03.540 --> 41:05.320]  I guess 86. Yeah, 86.
[41:08.280 --> 41:11.620]  What? Makoko, is that what you said, Geoff? You're bringing up Makoko or something?
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.560]  Yeah. Yeah, I believe so. In Expedition 33, there's a character named
[41:17.060 --> 41:21.380]  Monaco, which is not Makoko, but I would absolutely buy a little boo-boo if it looked like that.
[41:21.860 --> 41:26.540]  Just a weird looking wooden guy with a speedo. Yeah, he's got like a head mask thing.
[41:26.760 --> 41:31.700]  But I've been I'm playing a lot of Expedition 33 and I brought this up to Gavin and I want to bring
[41:31.700 --> 41:37.800]  it up on the podcast so we could pressure him into doing this. But I encountered the number one
[41:37.800 --> 41:46.220]  villain in Gavin's heart in that game. There is a boss. My nemesis. Named Chromatic Aberration.
[41:48.420 --> 41:53.620]  I think I immediately texted Gavin. I was like, we need to make content where you cannot stop
[41:53.620 --> 41:57.180]  playing this until you defeat your enemy, Chromatic Aberration.
[41:57.780 --> 42:02.780]  There should be an Easter egg in that game where if you stumble across this boss and you start
[42:02.780 --> 42:06.900]  fighting him and then you go to the menu and settings and turn off Chromatic Aberration,
[42:07.040 --> 42:12.440]  he should just vanish from the game. That's a great idea. That's so Kojima.
[42:12.740 --> 42:16.200]  I love it. That's Makoko. They look different. I can tell the difference.
[42:16.200 --> 42:21.620]  They're related. Honestly, Labubu looks like they would fit in Expedition 33. There's kind of a
[42:23.140 --> 42:26.180]  weird aesthetic to it. They make me sick.
[42:28.240 --> 42:31.340]  I think I'm with Gavin. What makes you sick?
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.960]  Disgusts me. Chromatic Aberration or the stuffed animal?
[42:38.780 --> 42:42.960]  The Labubu. Well, that's Makoko.
[42:43.880 --> 42:47.280]  Yeah, that's not a Labubu. Well, Makoko is a Labubu, yeah.
[42:47.540 --> 42:51.880]  Makoko is a Labubu, not like Monaco. Monaco knows Chromatic Aberration.
[42:52.160 --> 42:54.480]  Do you know how much that one I just posted cost?
[42:54.780 --> 43:02.860]  It's going to make me mad. So the rub with Makoko, as I understand it, is that you cannot
[43:02.860 --> 43:09.500]  buy Makoko from Pop Mart, the store. You have to go to Pop Land, the theme park in China to get it.
[43:09.500 --> 43:14.660]  And so on StockX and stuff, a Makoko will run you about $180 to $200.
[43:16.820 --> 43:19.040]  Same size as the other ones, by the way. Little.
[43:19.620 --> 43:21.380]  Wow. You don't fancy standing in line in China?
[43:23.720 --> 43:29.020]  Well, I do, but the plane ticket alone is going to be more than just paying $150. Also,
[43:29.060 --> 43:32.120]  I don't want it. I just enjoy watching other people want it.
[43:32.620 --> 43:34.540]  Geoff, was Marcus Smart your Labubu?
[43:35.220 --> 43:37.280]  Yeah, yeah. Marcus Smart's my Labubu.
[43:38.420 --> 43:41.360]  Marcus Washington Wizard Smart is my Labubu.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.780]  I'm surprised Furby didn't do more collabs. Why isn't there a Labubu Furby?
[43:48.700 --> 43:52.160]  I think Furby existed in a time before collabs.
[43:52.860 --> 43:54.960]  Yeah, that's a great point. It's a really good point.
[43:55.700 --> 43:56.360]  He stood alone.
[43:56.920 --> 43:57.120]  He did.
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.040]  Plus, I don't know if Furby's big enough. Labubu collabs with Coke.
[44:02.020 --> 44:02.360]  Really?
[44:03.080 --> 44:06.720]  Yeah, but Furby was hot shit. There was one Christmas where everyone was trying to get Furby.
[44:07.360 --> 44:07.620]  That's true.
[44:08.720 --> 44:11.340]  There will be one year of everyone trying to get Labubu.
[44:12.900 --> 44:17.120]  I thought he was holding a gun. I thought that was a rifle. I did not
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.960]  immediately register as a Coca-Cola bottle. I thought that that was a weapon.
[44:21.340 --> 44:22.960]  That's next year's collab with Glott.
[44:28.460 --> 44:29.960]  That was it for my bike ride.
[44:30.580 --> 44:31.720]  That was quite the bike ride.
[44:32.700 --> 44:35.960]  Yeah, I think we should do a group bike ride to see what adventures we all...
[44:35.960 --> 44:38.740]  We should all just do a bike ride and then we'll all remember stuff and
[44:38.740 --> 44:40.420]  see if we remembered the same stuff from the trip.
[44:40.680 --> 44:44.000]  Yeah, and keep your eyes out for hockey sticks because they're out there.
[44:44.600 --> 44:45.720]  And dead bodies and snakes.
[44:46.240 --> 44:50.560]  And dead bodies and snakes, yeah. I hope it's a long time before I see a snake.
[44:51.120 --> 44:55.240]  I do too, for you. Have you seen these Spongebob Labubus?
[44:55.500 --> 44:57.580]  What? Is that a real thing?
[44:57.960 --> 44:59.300]  There's Spongebob Labubus?
[44:59.340 --> 45:01.620]  Yeah, and they look nothing like the Labubus.
[45:01.620 --> 45:04.900]  I don't understand how these are Labubus, but these are the Spongebob Labubus.
[45:05.220 --> 45:07.240]  These are worse. These are so much worse.
[45:07.520 --> 45:08.600]  These are so much worse.
[45:08.740 --> 45:10.040]  Oh yeah, Spongebob monsters.
[45:10.400 --> 45:12.980]  I don't like looking at a single one of these things.
[45:13.140 --> 45:15.520]  This is... I don't like this at all.
[45:15.900 --> 45:18.440]  That Mr. Krabs is fucked up.
[45:19.060 --> 45:22.720]  It's... Mr. Krabs in specific is disturbing.
[45:25.080 --> 45:30.500]  And yeah, Spongebob with the pumpkin is weird.
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.580]  Do you think the guy in the factory is, like,
[45:33.220 --> 45:36.500]  installing this injection mold plate and just going like...
[45:40.600 --> 45:42.880]  Hey Gav, check it out. It's Cave Bob Spongeman.
[45:49.380 --> 45:51.880]  We should do that BMX track at GTA again.
[45:52.480 --> 45:55.240]  Okay. All right. I'd love to. I'd absolutely love to.
[45:56.140 --> 46:00.760]  Hey, I saw a TikTok about a prank that I wanted to play on one of you guys,
[46:01.480 --> 46:04.880]  but I've decided not to do it because I don't think it'd be worth the fallout.
[46:05.160 --> 46:06.920]  But I would like to share the prank with you
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.920]  in case you want to play it on somebody else, you know.
[46:09.260 --> 46:11.600]  Is this the thing that you said you didn't want to do because it would end a friendship?
[46:11.920 --> 46:13.780]  I thought it might. Yeah, I don't know how... I don't know how...
[46:15.420 --> 46:17.460]  Yeah, I don't know if you guys are cool enough
[46:17.460 --> 46:19.320]  to live with a prank like this for a long time.
[46:19.780 --> 46:22.800]  But somehow this guy's... I saw a TikTok of this dude who said,
[46:22.800 --> 46:25.220]  if you ever want to really screw somebody over for the rest of their lives,
[46:25.780 --> 46:30.380]  a friend of his about two or three years ago wrote his...
[46:30.380 --> 46:34.220]  in Sharpie, wrote his phone number inside a porta potty and said,
[46:34.440 --> 46:36.980]  send me pictures of your poop to this number.
[46:38.300 --> 46:38.940]  God damn it.
[46:38.980 --> 46:41.060]  And then he said for about two weeks,
[46:41.100 --> 46:45.920]  he just got the most heinous construction worker blowout shits.
[46:46.600 --> 46:48.680]  And he couldn't do anything about it because each
[46:49.200 --> 46:51.800]  shit is coming from... each text is coming from a different number.
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.160]  So there's no way to... there's no way to block it, right?
[46:55.540 --> 46:59.800]  But then, you know, the porta potty gets moved from the site and it goes somewhere else.
[47:00.020 --> 47:03.360]  And he says that the shit texts would stop for a while.
[47:03.520 --> 47:05.840]  And then like three months later, he'd get them for a month
[47:05.840 --> 47:07.520]  and then they'd go away for a while.
[47:07.520 --> 47:09.860]  And then he would get them for like another month.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.120]  And for two years, just every once in a while,
[47:12.180 --> 47:14.100]  whenever that porta potty is in rotation somewhere,
[47:14.280 --> 47:17.840]  he just gets the worst shits known to man texted to him.
[47:18.040 --> 47:21.620]  And you have no idea where the porta potty is.
[47:21.620 --> 47:22.620]  It's always moving, right?
[47:22.700 --> 47:24.500]  So there's no way to find it and remove it.
[47:24.720 --> 47:27.140]  So for the rest of the use of that porta potty,
[47:27.900 --> 47:31.740]  he's just doomed to get shits... nasty shit texts.
[47:31.940 --> 47:33.620]  Oh, break it out.
[47:33.900 --> 47:35.020]  Oh, that's awful.
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.440]  I was on a Bacardi commercial once that was like five days long
[47:40.440 --> 47:43.420]  and the medic kept sending me pictures of his wife's shits.
[47:43.880 --> 47:45.260]  And I was like, what?
[47:46.060 --> 47:47.520]  I don't... what are you talking about?
[47:47.640 --> 47:48.580]  What are you saying?
[47:49.260 --> 47:51.580]  What are you saying?
[47:52.880 --> 47:56.020]  His wife would text him her shits every day and he'd be like,
[47:56.120 --> 47:57.280]  uh, new one from the wife.
[47:57.380 --> 47:58.460]  And I'd be like, God.
[47:59.580 --> 48:00.320]  Damn, dude.
[48:00.440 --> 48:01.800]  What are you talking about?
[48:02.160 --> 48:05.440]  Yes, I'm like aghast at what you just said, man.
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.720]  That might be one of the craziest things I've ever heard.
[48:10.840 --> 48:14.760]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.800]  And I was like 18, maybe I was 19.
[48:17.800 --> 48:20.440]  It was I was just like, why does this guy like me so much?
[48:22.200 --> 48:22.520]  What?
[48:23.680 --> 48:25.620]  Do you think he wanted to do stuff with you?
[48:26.200 --> 48:27.200]  Nah, he was just...
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.720]  He was just, uh, he just just latched on to me at the beginning of the shoot.
[48:31.780 --> 48:34.720]  He kept talking to me and I was like, yeah, being friendly at first.
[48:34.780 --> 48:37.620]  And then the shits came in, he got real familiar real fast.
[48:37.700 --> 48:39.040]  And then I was just like, oh my God.
[48:40.040 --> 48:41.040]  Did he ever stop?
[48:41.080 --> 48:43.460]  Or did you just have to look at those shits the entirety of the shoot?
[48:44.080 --> 48:45.160]  Oh, it was the whole shoot.
[48:45.320 --> 48:47.500]  The shoot ended and I never saw him again.
[48:47.800 --> 48:49.880]  This is what I love about this podcast.
[48:50.540 --> 48:50.620]  Yeah.
[48:50.760 --> 48:53.520]  I throw out a TikTok I saw that's a funny prank.
[48:53.900 --> 48:58.360]  Gavin instantly has a real life story that trumps it by a thousand.
[48:58.960 --> 48:59.380]  Insane.
[48:59.680 --> 48:59.840]  Yeah.
[49:00.280 --> 49:04.160]  I don't know if you've spent a lot of time on sets, but the medics are bored.
[49:04.520 --> 49:05.680]  They don't often do stuff.
[49:05.720 --> 49:08.100]  I mean, they're very important to have when something happens.
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.560]  Yeah, they are just quiddling their thumbs all goddamn day.
[49:12.980 --> 49:16.180]  They're also full of shit and very scared of ghosts, apparently.
[49:16.180 --> 49:20.000]  It was the fucking medics that shut down our horror shoot
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.520]  because the lady saw an orb and it chased her through the woods.
[49:22.580 --> 49:25.120]  Yeah, a very real thing.
[49:25.260 --> 49:25.740]  Absolutely.
[49:27.520 --> 49:28.620]  Yeah, it was a medic.
[49:29.100 --> 49:29.780]  Oh my God.
[49:30.980 --> 49:32.500]  Crazy, crazy.
[49:33.460 --> 49:37.100]  Have you ever tried to do a prank and somebody around you shut it down?
[49:39.340 --> 49:40.420]  Probably a lot.
[49:40.540 --> 49:42.860]  Yeah, probably a lot in Achievement Hunter.
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.200]  But go on.
[49:44.760 --> 49:51.600]  My most recent one, I was talking to somebody about someone that they don't talk to anymore.
[49:51.840 --> 49:54.160]  They had a falling out. They no longer speak.
[49:54.920 --> 49:58.540]  And they brought them up and they're not dead.
[49:58.620 --> 50:00.480]  But I just said, oh yeah, they passed away recently.
[50:00.740 --> 50:01.200]  They're dead.
[50:01.880 --> 50:03.920]  Because I thought in my head they wouldn't know
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.600]  and they would just think that this person was dead, that they were just shit talking.
[50:07.960 --> 50:09.120]  And that was funny to me.
[50:09.400 --> 50:13.300]  And I thought they'd just continue on their lives thinking that this person was dead, who's alive.
[50:13.940 --> 50:19.540]  And my partner was there in the conversation and immediately shut it down and said,
[50:19.660 --> 50:23.280]  no, he's kidding. He's fine. He's not dead.
[50:23.720 --> 50:26.540]  And I was like, oh man, I really could have got him with that one.
[50:26.600 --> 50:31.480]  He definitely would have thought for quite a while until I probably told him that was a joke,
[50:31.480 --> 50:33.100]  that that person was dead.
[50:37.600 --> 50:42.240]  I got a little too into setting people and stuff on fire for a while.
[50:43.300 --> 50:45.800]  I think people told me to knock it off.
[50:46.940 --> 50:50.140]  You're just an arson for a bit. You went through an arson phase.
[50:50.440 --> 50:53.580]  You can't be setting people's shoes on fire anymore. You got to stop that.
[50:53.860 --> 50:55.560]  I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[51:02.050 --> 51:04.710]  Gavin's not laughing because so much of the stuff got blown up.
[51:06.730 --> 51:10.850]  This, this turned into like the weirdest last five minutes.
[51:11.170 --> 51:16.750]  Like I, I'm, I'm like just kind of sitting here stunned by everything you guys are saying.
[51:16.750 --> 51:23.050]  I just can't like wild, wild, wild the stuff that you're saying right now.
[51:23.050 --> 51:24.010]  I was thinking of weird.
[51:24.370 --> 51:27.450]  Andrew, guess who the first person was to get completely naked in the new office?
[51:28.290 --> 51:29.050]  That's a great question.
[51:29.430 --> 51:31.130]  Oh, who was it?
[51:32.910 --> 51:37.010]  My instincts, my guess would be Geoff, but I feel like that's too obvious.
[51:37.590 --> 51:39.730]  I'm going to say Nick because he's the least I'd expect.
[51:40.750 --> 51:41.170]  Correct.
[51:42.730 --> 51:43.730]  Incredible guess.
[51:44.430 --> 51:45.430]  Incredible guess.
[51:45.430 --> 51:46.990]  What happened, Nick?
[51:48.070 --> 51:52.610]  I was at the office setting up some audio equipment and I, uh, I also had to finish
[51:52.610 --> 51:57.630]  an episode edit, so I was setting that to export and I was like, oh, I got like,
[51:57.710 --> 51:59.270]  I don't know, 30 minutes to kill.
[51:59.590 --> 52:06.070]  So I drove, uh, nearby to go shoot some hoops and, uh, came back and I was like,
[52:06.110 --> 52:08.010]  well, I'm all sweaty, but I have a change of clothes in the car.
[52:08.130 --> 52:11.930]  I was like, I do have a dinner plan, so I should probably not stink.
[52:11.930 --> 52:14.230]  So I used the shower in the office.
[52:14.430 --> 52:17.630]  I turned it on, the water came out brown, and then,
[52:19.470 --> 52:21.450]  and then I settled in for a shower.
[52:21.630 --> 52:23.670]  Everything was fine and kept the door closed.
[52:23.790 --> 52:24.550]  We have a towel there.
[52:24.650 --> 52:25.270]  Did you buy shampoo?
[52:26.150 --> 52:26.550]  Uh, no.
[52:26.730 --> 52:27.590]  He just rinsed off.
[52:28.070 --> 52:28.790]  I bought body wash.
[52:29.190 --> 52:31.970]  Did you find the shower M&Ms I left for Eric?
[52:32.490 --> 52:33.930]  Yeah, I took them out while I showered.
[52:33.970 --> 52:34.290]  Oh, okay.
[52:34.330 --> 52:35.250]  I put them back after it dried.
[52:37.130 --> 52:38.370]  I'm scared now.
[52:38.530 --> 52:41.650]  I just would have been so disturbed if I showed up at the office
[52:41.650 --> 52:45.010]  and Nick was just completely stalkers in the bathroom.
[52:45.270 --> 52:46.770]  I went to the office twice that day.
[52:46.890 --> 52:48.810]  I could have very easily run into him in the shower.
[52:48.910 --> 52:50.630]  That would have been the most confusing thing ever.
[52:51.310 --> 52:52.730]  The door has a lock, guys.
[52:52.850 --> 52:55.190]  It's not like I had the door open like, look at me!
[52:55.430 --> 53:00.870]  Yeah, but Nick, I randomly roam around the office as a robot.
[53:01.270 --> 53:05.310]  Like, if I saw you walk out with a towel, I would have been alarmed.
[53:06.010 --> 53:06.810]  That's crazy.
[53:07.210 --> 53:08.430]  I had to close into the bathroom.
[53:08.750 --> 53:10.230]  I knew you were there somewhere.
[53:10.230 --> 53:13.470]  I just feel like if you hadn't have told me this story,
[53:14.010 --> 53:17.950]  I would have been so disturbed if I came into the office and I heard someone in the shower.
[53:18.070 --> 53:19.910]  I would have thought someone broke in to take a shower.
[53:20.370 --> 53:23.290]  I sure as shit wouldn't have thought one of us was taking a shower there.
[53:23.850 --> 53:24.470]  It's insane.
[53:25.350 --> 53:26.010]  What do you mean?
[53:26.370 --> 53:27.870]  You took a shit the first day.
[53:28.630 --> 53:29.350]  Well, yeah.
[53:29.750 --> 53:30.650]  You got a shit.
[53:30.770 --> 53:31.710]  You got a shit at work.
[53:31.790 --> 53:32.790]  You have to shower at work.
[53:33.190 --> 53:34.950]  I'm not mad that you took the shower.
[53:35.090 --> 53:37.210]  I just think it's wild that it happened that fast.
[53:37.610 --> 53:39.370]  And also, I'm just kind of scared of that bathroom.
[53:40.630 --> 53:42.510]  Yeah, I couldn't figure out how to get hot water.
[53:42.590 --> 53:43.130]  It was very cold.
[53:43.950 --> 53:47.010]  Oh, you just got to go into the kitchen and take a shower in the fucking kitchen sink.
[53:47.610 --> 53:49.350]  You just keep a basketball in your car?
[53:50.390 --> 53:51.990]  Yeah, I keep a basketball in my car, Andrew.
[53:52.090 --> 53:53.890]  We have the hottest milk coming out of the kitchen sink.
[53:54.010 --> 53:54.210]  I love it.
[53:54.230 --> 53:55.090]  You got to check it out.
[53:55.190 --> 53:55.670]  It's awesome.
[53:56.090 --> 53:56.690]  The hottest milk?
[53:57.310 --> 53:58.010]  Did he say milk?
[53:58.610 --> 53:58.830]  Yeah.
[53:59.050 --> 54:01.150]  Have you guys not seen how white it turns like milk?
[54:01.250 --> 54:01.810]  Oh, yeah.
[54:02.830 --> 54:03.410]  It's awesome.
[54:04.190 --> 54:09.150]  It's weird that the water's already boiling when it comes out of the spigots.
[54:12.230 --> 54:13.070]  Oh, God.
[54:15.250 --> 54:17.550]  Could you get it so hot that it just comes out of steam?
[54:19.650 --> 54:21.330]  That would be crazy.
[54:21.850 --> 54:23.170]  That would have helped the gumbler.
[54:24.350 --> 54:25.210]  Yeah, could have.
[54:27.310 --> 54:28.610]  Yeah, we should put that out soon.
[54:28.670 --> 54:29.310]  I want to edit that one.
[54:29.930 --> 54:30.810]  Okay, edit it.
[54:30.890 --> 54:31.390]  Let's do it.
[54:32.090 --> 54:32.830]  Yeah, you're in the files.
[54:33.630 --> 54:34.570]  Yeah, nobody's stopping you.
[54:34.850 --> 54:36.290]  Yeah, you can just edit whenever you want.
[54:36.450 --> 54:38.150]  We're scheduled out quite far, is what I mean.
[54:38.190 --> 54:38.650]  Maybe we could...
[54:38.650 --> 54:41.170]  At this point in this recording?
[54:41.470 --> 54:42.290]  Not really.
[54:42.550 --> 54:43.410]  Not super far.
[54:44.110 --> 54:46.270]  I'm worried the gumbler will come out before this recording.
[54:47.230 --> 54:47.750]  It might.
[54:48.190 --> 54:48.690]  It could, though.
[54:48.690 --> 54:48.930]  It might.
[54:49.230 --> 54:49.990]  That'd be the goal.
[54:50.990 --> 54:51.730]  That's the goal?
[54:52.430 --> 54:53.170]  Yeah, why not?
[54:53.930 --> 54:55.510]  Geoff just said he's worried about it.
[54:56.170 --> 54:56.550]  But why?
[54:56.930 --> 54:57.510]  That's a good point.
[54:57.810 --> 54:59.170]  They've assuaged my concerns.
[54:59.270 --> 54:59.970]  I'm no longer worried.
[55:00.130 --> 55:01.190]  Hey, problem solved, guys.
[55:02.270 --> 55:03.310]  That's teamwork for you.
[55:05.150 --> 55:07.310]  Would the gumbler be an overseas edit for you?
[55:08.170 --> 55:08.570]  Oh.
[55:10.230 --> 55:10.630]  Gavin?
[55:11.390 --> 55:13.650]  Uh, I don't think I'm going to take anything.
[55:15.070 --> 55:15.470]  Okay.
[55:15.910 --> 55:16.610]  That's probably smart.
[55:17.290 --> 55:18.450]  Become property of the US government.
[55:22.170 --> 55:22.970]  Does anybody...
[55:22.970 --> 55:24.050]  But now that we're past all that,
[55:24.110 --> 55:26.790]  does anybody mind if I write their phone number in a port-a-potty
[55:26.790 --> 55:28.810]  and said, please text me pictures of your poops?
[55:29.310 --> 55:30.910]  Yeah, don't do that.
[55:31.310 --> 55:31.750]  What about this?
[55:31.870 --> 55:35.110]  I'll go back to the call sheet from 2007.
[55:35.890 --> 55:37.330]  I'll find that medic's number.
[55:37.850 --> 55:38.330]  Wow!
[55:40.090 --> 55:41.330]  Just text him.
[55:41.690 --> 55:42.470]  Text him some shits.
[55:42.710 --> 55:46.090]  You just have to get rid of that zero and put plus four four first.
[55:47.830 --> 55:48.790]  Could you...
[55:48.790 --> 55:52.930]  Could you imagine if that's how the wife found out that he was having an affair?
[55:53.390 --> 55:54.730]  Somebody else's shits?
[55:56.610 --> 55:58.250]  That is fucking funny.
[55:58.310 --> 56:00.250]  She's like, oh, is she sending you her shits too?
[56:00.390 --> 56:02.030]  Oh my god, she is!
[56:02.870 --> 56:05.890]  Like she didn't... she recognized that it was her own making?
[56:06.030 --> 56:06.910]  Yes, yeah.
[56:09.990 --> 56:11.430]  Better just not to cheat, I guess.
[56:11.870 --> 56:12.210]  Yeah.
[56:12.870 --> 56:14.190]  Keep those shits to yourself.
[56:19.120 --> 56:21.120]  I feel like these podcasts have healed me.
[56:21.260 --> 56:22.320]  I felt pretty shitty at the beginning.
[56:22.440 --> 56:23.840]  You sound so much better.
[56:24.060 --> 56:24.300]  It's better.
[56:25.760 --> 56:27.220]  Where... what's your percentage at now?
[56:27.320 --> 56:30.080]  You were 70% earlier night, then you made it 75.
[56:30.860 --> 56:32.120]  Probably at 80 now.
[56:32.120 --> 56:35.460]  Okay, so you're almost where you were when we were hanging out yesterday.
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.240]  Yeah, maybe if we did a like a gameplay after this, I'd be fully healed.
[56:39.960 --> 56:43.340]  I mean, in the interest of healing you, I'm willing to give it a try.
[56:45.160 --> 56:46.800]  Okay, then we have to wrap this up, right?
[56:46.860 --> 56:47.920]  Shall we wrap up?
[56:47.940 --> 56:49.160]  Probably stop the podcast.
[56:49.460 --> 56:51.660]  Yeah, yeah, then we... yeah, we got to start wrapping up, don't we?
[56:52.260 --> 56:55.220]  Yeah, but we're not stopping to go play a video game with Gavin.
[56:55.380 --> 56:58.920]  We're stopping because it's the natural conclusion of the podcast.
[56:59.400 --> 56:59.760]  That's true.
[56:59.780 --> 57:02.000]  I feel like that's important to mention.
[57:03.260 --> 57:09.560]  It's... this is where we all instinctively felt it was time to end and...
[57:10.460 --> 57:12.780]  I have a final suggestion.
[57:13.340 --> 57:13.640]  Okay.
[57:13.720 --> 57:14.820]  A little pitch for the group.
[57:15.320 --> 57:15.860]  Oh, yeah.
[57:16.240 --> 57:18.880]  No one will get back to me about getting squirrels out of my ceiling.
[57:19.200 --> 57:20.800]  What if we tackled it as a group?
[57:21.660 --> 57:25.160]  Glove up, mask up, get in the ceiling.
[57:26.280 --> 57:27.160]  Here's what we can do.
[57:27.480 --> 57:28.760]  We'll treat them like bacon bits.
[57:28.940 --> 57:31.640]  We'll get my leaf blower up there.
[57:31.640 --> 57:32.700]  We'll try to blow them out.
[57:33.200 --> 57:34.880]  Can you put me up there?
[57:35.220 --> 57:39.020]  Can you bring me over as the robot and put me up there and I'll roam around for you?
[57:39.140 --> 57:40.600]  I'll chase them out. I'll scurry them.
[57:41.340 --> 57:45.420]  Now, I can't speak for the quality of the ceiling in there, but we'll try.
[57:46.220 --> 57:46.540]  Yeah.
[57:46.640 --> 57:47.460]  I love this idea.
[57:47.960 --> 57:48.800]  Put me in there.
[57:49.240 --> 57:50.880]  Also, do you guys think I should...
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.360]  You remember how when I layered all my peas together, it sounded like Niagara Falls?
[57:55.940 --> 57:57.660]  Oh, I can replay it for you if you'd like.
[57:57.680 --> 57:59.100]  I remember when you did that.
[58:00.000 --> 58:00.920]  Yeah, you remember when I did that?
[58:00.920 --> 58:06.460]  Somebody in the comments recently suggested that I do that with shits and farts.
[58:06.800 --> 58:09.220]  Do you think I can make it sound like an atom bomb?
[58:09.620 --> 58:12.300]  No, I don't want you to do it. Please don't do it.
[58:12.440 --> 58:12.660]  Thank you.
[58:12.860 --> 58:14.340]  It might sound like a tractor starting.
[58:15.580 --> 58:16.780]  Oh, that's interesting.
[58:17.520 --> 58:18.900]  Well, maybe I'll play around with it.
[58:19.060 --> 58:22.940]  It sounds like you have material for when we do the Foley thing.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.300]  I've got a very particular way I'd like to do my Foley work.
[58:32.340 --> 58:34.140]  And all right, that'll do it.
[58:34.180 --> 58:34.800]  Oh, you know what?
[58:35.720 --> 58:37.480]  I was thinking this the other day, too.
[58:38.100 --> 58:41.800]  We should all watch a trilogy together that none of us have ever seen before.
[58:42.340 --> 58:46.140]  That might be hard to find, a trilogy that none of us have seen any of.
[58:46.400 --> 58:48.000]  But we should watch it in reverse.
[58:50.820 --> 58:52.160]  So each one is a prequel?
[58:52.580 --> 58:53.540]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:55.160 --> 58:57.500]  Because everybody always starts off and they're like,
[58:57.540 --> 59:00.180]  I liked the trilogy, but the first one was the best.
[59:00.180 --> 59:01.620]  And then it just kind of went downhill or whatever.
[59:02.160 --> 59:03.560]  What if you watch it in reverse?
[59:03.700 --> 59:05.100]  You feel differently, you know?
[59:05.180 --> 59:07.460]  What if we think the third one is the best because it's the first one we watched?
[59:07.840 --> 59:09.160]  Or what if that's the case?
[59:09.240 --> 59:12.000]  What if the trilogy just gets better as we build, you know?
[59:12.100 --> 59:15.460]  Could you imagine if someone had never seen the Matrix movies and watched them backwards?
[59:15.720 --> 59:16.460]  Oh, man.
[59:16.840 --> 59:17.240]  It'd be amazing.
[59:17.980 --> 59:18.840]  It'd be amazing.
[59:19.580 --> 59:21.720]  Or the Godfather or any of that stuff, right?
[59:22.940 --> 59:23.700]  Something to think about.
[59:24.000 --> 59:26.160]  We just have to identify what that trilogy is.
[59:26.500 --> 59:28.540]  Wonder if there is one that none of us have seen.
[59:29.140 --> 59:32.400]  I mean, there's probably a lot of foreign language trilogies that none of us have seen.
[59:32.560 --> 59:32.940]  Definitely.
[59:34.660 --> 59:36.500]  I'm going to guess, you know, you know what?
[59:36.520 --> 59:38.080]  I've never seen any of the...
[59:39.020 --> 59:40.000]  What are they like?
[59:41.360 --> 59:42.420]  Air Force One?
[59:42.580 --> 59:46.520]  The one where Aaron Eckhart saves the president because his planes always crash?
[59:47.120 --> 59:48.000]  Oh, I've seen all this.
[59:48.500 --> 59:49.700]  Oh, I've never seen...
[59:50.380 --> 59:52.540]  What about how many Riddick films are there?
[59:53.060 --> 59:55.080]  Seen a couple of those, right?
[59:55.400 --> 59:56.020]  Yeah, I've seen them.
[59:56.380 --> 59:57.820]  How many Triple X films are there?
[59:57.820 --> 59:58.480]  Seen them.
[59:58.840 --> 59:59.720]  Three of those, seen them.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.400]  Yeah, yeah, it's going to be hard.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.480]  I've got so many open trilogies, but we'll figure it out.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.700]  I guess we'll have to watch Charmed first and then we'll get to this.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:10.660]  What's that?
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.400]  Wheel of Decades, motherfucker.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:15.580]  Yep, yep.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.240]  All right, that'll probably do it for episode 58.
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.940]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:25.160]  We really enjoyed spending the last hour and five minutes or so with you.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.700]  We hope to see you right back here in this very spot next week for episode 59
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.380]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.800]  It's going to blow your dick off.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:36.760]  Okay.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.100]  Insane.
[01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.000]  Check out the Patreon.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:40.940]  Hang on to your dicks.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:41.920]  We'll see you next time.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:42.380]  Bye.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.180]  Bye.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:44.020]  Bye.
