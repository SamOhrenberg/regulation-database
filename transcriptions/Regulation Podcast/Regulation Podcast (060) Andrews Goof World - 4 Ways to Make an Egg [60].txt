[00:00.000 --> 00:02.720]  Did you say- I said you're eating and you said you're not chewing?
[00:03.680 --> 00:04.340]  I said I'm not chewing.
[00:07.160 --> 00:09.340]  But now I am. I wasn't chewing then.
[00:09.560 --> 00:12.580]  What? Do you think eating is only when you chew?
[00:13.880 --> 00:14.280]  Yeah.
[00:14.860 --> 00:17.720]  Oh, he's got a- he might have a point.
[00:18.120 --> 00:18.560]  I do.
[00:18.840 --> 00:19.800]  You're not eating gum.
[00:19.900 --> 00:23.360]  So if you have food in your mouth and you're not chewing it, you're not eating.
[00:23.800 --> 00:24.200]  No.
[00:24.400 --> 00:25.660]  It wasn't in my mouth at that point, though.
[00:25.840 --> 00:26.980]  But it's the act of eating.
[00:27.420 --> 00:29.160]  But what about gazpacho?
[00:29.620 --> 00:30.640]  What are you eating?
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.420]  A piece of chocolate.
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.380]  Like, you don't chew soup.
[00:34.580 --> 00:36.160]  That was so loud for chocolate.
[00:36.560 --> 00:37.860]  It was from the freezer.
[00:38.740 --> 00:40.120]  Don't freeze your chocolate.
[00:40.540 --> 00:42.040]  Well, it depends. Yeah, it depends.
[00:42.280 --> 00:44.160]  There are certain things that like-
[00:44.160 --> 00:45.560]  Yeah, frozen chocolate's pretty good.
[00:46.180 --> 00:47.900]  What kind of chocolate are we talking about here?
[00:48.260 --> 00:51.040]  Dark chocolate. I bought it from the- one of the Vegas airport
[00:51.560 --> 00:52.360]  chocolate places.
[00:52.620 --> 00:52.840]  Hmm.
[00:53.360 --> 00:53.880]  What brand?
[00:54.640 --> 00:55.040]  What percent?
[00:55.320 --> 00:56.860]  The Vegas airport chocolate places.
[00:57.040 --> 00:57.760]  I don't know what it is.
[00:59.220 --> 01:03.340]  We need to overcome our poor roots, Nick.
[01:03.480 --> 01:04.720]  And you don't have to freeze your chocolate.
[01:04.840 --> 01:05.620]  You can just eat it.
[01:05.720 --> 01:07.820]  You can eat however much you want and then buy more.
[01:08.220 --> 01:09.620]  But it's to slow me down.
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.860]  I understand. I totally.
[01:12.060 --> 01:12.820]  I mean, I get it.
[01:13.020 --> 01:14.120]  It's not a money thing, Eric.
[01:14.200 --> 01:15.040]  It's a calorie thing.
[01:16.840 --> 01:18.320]  So you're just trying-
[01:18.320 --> 01:21.740]  you're trying to prolong it and have nice chocolate for as long as you can.
[01:22.080 --> 01:22.260]  Yeah.
[01:22.620 --> 01:22.960]  Got it.
[01:22.980 --> 01:25.180]  It's just to make me take longer to eat it.
[01:25.300 --> 01:25.620]  Got it.
[01:26.100 --> 01:27.640]  Well, eat it only when you're chewing.
[01:27.640 --> 01:28.200]  Yeah.
[01:28.540 --> 01:30.280]  Is it harder to eat frozen chocolate?
[01:30.840 --> 01:31.060]  Yeah.
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.480]  It's it takes longer to get through it.
[01:34.020 --> 01:35.240]  Of course it's harder.
[01:35.540 --> 01:35.960]  Apply pressure.
[01:36.060 --> 01:36.360]  Yeah. What?
[01:37.280 --> 01:40.280]  Hey, is it harder to eat frozen spaghetti, Gavin?
[01:40.520 --> 01:41.960]  Harder to drink frozen water.
[01:42.500 --> 01:43.640]  Chocolate's already hard.
[01:44.240 --> 01:45.040]  Yeah, but it gets harder.
[01:46.100 --> 01:47.980]  Is this the beginning of the episode?
[01:48.260 --> 01:50.160]  Is this in the episode?
[01:50.340 --> 01:51.040]  Is that what this is?
[01:51.520 --> 01:55.620]  If I timed myself eating chocolate from the fridge versus chocolate from the freezer,
[01:55.800 --> 01:57.100]  I assume they'd be very similar.
[01:57.100 --> 01:58.680]  Can you write that down for us, Geoff?
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.260]  Yeah, hold on. Let me get it.
[02:00.260 --> 02:00.420]  Thank you.
[02:01.020 --> 02:02.020]  Yeah, it's different.
[02:02.120 --> 02:02.580]  It's different.
[02:02.820 --> 02:10.940]  Gavin eats thaw and frozen chocolate self-race to see how dumb he is.
[02:10.940 --> 02:12.680]  Well, there needs to be a room temp one, too, right?
[02:12.760 --> 02:13.460]  You need all three.
[02:13.640 --> 02:14.940]  You gotta have a baseline.
[02:15.460 --> 02:16.180]  Room temp.
[02:16.180 --> 02:18.600]  Gavin, I freeze before I fly because I don't like flying.
[02:18.780 --> 02:20.880]  I freeze a bag of dark chocolate M&M's.
[02:21.000 --> 02:23.380]  And that way, by the time I'm on the plane, they haven't melted.
[02:24.260 --> 02:26.360]  Oh, I think M&M's don't melt.
[02:26.360 --> 02:27.400]  Isn't that like their thing?
[02:28.020 --> 02:28.340]  Yeah.
[02:28.400 --> 02:29.980]  Have you been in the Vegas heat?
[02:30.080 --> 02:30.400]  They melt.
[02:30.620 --> 02:34.320]  Melts in your mouth, not in your hands, I believe was the whole catchphrase.
[02:34.640 --> 02:36.540]  Yeah, they melt on the inside of the shell.
[02:36.700 --> 02:37.980]  You can't melt so quick.
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.960]  They were designed for the US military in World War One.
[02:41.040 --> 02:41.560]  Isn't that right?
[02:41.880 --> 02:42.900]  World War One or World War Two, maybe.
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.260]  Is that what the M stands for?
[02:44.480 --> 02:45.340]  To give the soldiers.
[02:45.500 --> 02:47.560]  Yeah, it's military and might.
[02:48.320 --> 02:50.800]  No, I think it was just like to give the soldiers something that they could eat
[02:50.800 --> 02:52.840]  without getting chocolate all over their hands while they need to kill people.
[02:53.320 --> 02:53.960]  Jesus Christ.
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.340]  Is this the episode?
[02:55.340 --> 02:56.480]  Are we in this episode?
[02:56.620 --> 02:59.880]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[03:00.080 --> 03:01.520]  This is episode 60.
[03:01.840 --> 03:05.120]  You'll notice we switched it up a little bit and we did some talking before
[03:05.120 --> 03:05.680]  the intro.
[03:05.800 --> 03:08.640]  Now we're we're like, just we're just like, you know,
[03:08.680 --> 03:10.200]  throwing on into the intro.
[03:10.380 --> 03:12.840]  It's a bit of a throwback to our old face days.
[03:13.260 --> 03:15.620]  Nick, go ahead and bleep that one to make sure that we do it right.
[03:15.840 --> 03:16.760]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[03:16.760 --> 03:19.960]  With me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Baudour, Nick Schwartz.
[03:20.200 --> 03:22.480]  This is part two of Las Vegas.
[03:22.480 --> 03:24.600]  Smee shat on my Nintendo Switch.
[03:27.340 --> 03:28.880]  First one or the second one?
[03:29.760 --> 03:33.420]  I had my Switch 2 for three days and he shats on the screen.
[03:33.740 --> 03:34.660]  Oh, no.
[03:40.270 --> 03:40.990]  Really?
[03:43.590 --> 03:48.030]  What kind of hatred must that cat have
[03:48.030 --> 03:51.990]  towards you to shit on your Switch screen?
[03:52.750 --> 03:54.310]  Do you think it's a jealousy thing?
[03:54.310 --> 03:56.730]  Like you spend too much time with your Nintendo and not enough time with Smee?
[03:57.450 --> 04:00.210]  He actually just shat on the on a blanket on the couch.
[04:00.370 --> 04:02.810]  But then he always tries to bury the shit.
[04:03.050 --> 04:04.730]  And my Switch was on the blanket.
[04:04.930 --> 04:08.370]  So he just kicked the shit out of the Switch until it was face down in his turd.
[04:15.780 --> 04:18.420]  Man, no matter who you are in life,
[04:18.500 --> 04:22.220]  no matter where you are on terms of the success ladder up or down,
[04:22.700 --> 04:24.980]  we all have to deal with shit.
[04:25.560 --> 04:28.220]  Always. It never goes away.
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.160]  But if you pulled that airport guy, he would not think that that'd be a Gavin problem.
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.440]  Does anyone not have to deal with shit?
[04:36.560 --> 04:39.800]  Like, is anyone so rich that they just shit and walk away
[04:39.800 --> 04:42.240]  and then a bunch of people wipe their ass and clear it up and stuff?
[04:44.100 --> 04:45.620]  Babies. I assume so.
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.360]  Babies. Babies and old people.
[04:48.920 --> 04:52.080]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:54.540 --> 05:00.520]  I mean, I'm just I'm thinking about how rich Gavin would be to have a ball knuckler.
[05:02.900 --> 05:04.480]  What is that, Bezos?
[05:04.600 --> 05:06.460]  Because you you knuckle the balls or whatever.
[05:06.560 --> 05:08.240]  You punch the cell. You do something.
[05:08.540 --> 05:11.220]  The P better. Oh, yeah.
[05:11.220 --> 05:15.840]  You had like six episodes about how you like pressed your balls or something.
[05:16.180 --> 05:17.520]  No, it wasn't about me knuckling.
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.000]  I was talking about if there was going to be a bidet attachment.
[05:21.160 --> 05:24.120]  Yeah. I'm not there knuckling my the back of my balls.
[05:24.320 --> 05:25.700]  I just think it would help get the drips out.
[05:26.120 --> 05:27.040]  Oh, you've never done that?
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.260]  I'm I'm a ball lifter and a ball sort of compressor.
[05:30.680 --> 05:33.540]  But I've never knuckled the back.
[05:34.060 --> 05:36.880]  I'm pretty sure you've given the impression that you've knuckled the back
[05:36.880 --> 05:39.520]  because people keep talking about how it was a great tip you gave them
[05:39.520 --> 05:41.100]  and how they're doing it just like you now.
[05:41.660 --> 05:43.220]  I know, but I do it with like a thumb.
[05:43.380 --> 05:44.140]  I've never been able to.
[05:44.340 --> 05:46.780]  There's no angle that works for knuckling the back of my balls.
[05:47.620 --> 05:49.120]  How would I get? How do I get back there?
[05:49.120 --> 05:50.160]  I don't know.
[05:50.300 --> 05:51.560]  You surely have to do it from behind.
[05:51.680 --> 05:55.240]  And there's not enough room to get my whole fist down into the toilet.
[05:55.340 --> 05:56.660]  And my elbow goes the wrong way.
[05:56.860 --> 05:57.820]  But you do your thumb.
[05:58.220 --> 06:02.900]  On the list of rich guy, weird jobs you have for them.
[06:03.220 --> 06:04.940]  Ball knuckler would not be high on the list.
[06:05.640 --> 06:06.520]  That's not a fun one.
[06:07.240 --> 06:08.880]  Like if someone wanted that job.
[06:09.020 --> 06:11.040]  Like I feel like you hear about super wealthy people
[06:11.040 --> 06:13.400]  paying for someone to just always be their caddy.
[06:13.680 --> 06:16.380]  Like how Snoop Dogg has somebody who rolls joints for him.
[06:16.500 --> 06:17.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[06:17.440 --> 06:20.720]  Like there are fun, rich guy jobs
[06:20.720 --> 06:24.100]  where the person just has an absurd job because of
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.820]  they're getting paid by someone who has an absurd amount of money.
[06:27.260 --> 06:29.600]  Ball knuckler would not be one of those jobs.
[06:29.860 --> 06:31.320]  That would be low on the ladder.
[06:31.760 --> 06:33.940]  It probably comes with full benefits, though, right?
[06:35.520 --> 06:39.340]  Like if you get a 401k health and dental, you could stomach some balls.
[06:39.900 --> 06:42.360]  What if you were so rich that it carried on down?
[06:42.440 --> 06:44.740]  Like what if the ball knuckler had a hand sanitizer?
[06:44.740 --> 06:46.220]  The ball knuckler.
[06:46.360 --> 06:49.360]  The way that you said that was like it's a profession, like it's
[06:49.360 --> 06:52.080]  it's like exit, like the executor or whatever.
[06:52.400 --> 06:57.440]  Yeah, that's just a long line of ball knucklers.
[06:57.680 --> 07:00.600]  There's a ball knuckler next to him is a guy that sanitizes
[07:00.600 --> 07:02.220]  the hands of the ball knuckler.
[07:02.240 --> 07:05.000]  Oh, there's a sanitizer. It's a whole different job.
[07:05.220 --> 07:06.940]  So it's like you're going skin to skin.
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.820]  You're not wearing like a blue glove or anything.
[07:08.820 --> 07:12.560]  And then as soon as it's over, then somebody cleans your hands for you.
[07:12.560 --> 07:15.920]  And that's like that's like reclaiming your bit of dignity.
[07:16.140 --> 07:17.760]  You have to touch a rich guy's balls.
[07:17.900 --> 07:20.800]  But now a guy who's a little bit lower on the totem pole
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.960]  has to clean your hands from those balls.
[07:23.600 --> 07:26.820]  This is a horrific thing to imagine, but it is funny to picture it
[07:26.820 --> 07:30.800]  like it is a NASCAR pit stop every time you leave the bathroom.
[07:31.220 --> 07:34.760]  Like there's just a team of people rushing you to do specific things.
[07:34.760 --> 07:35.660]  I would feel crazy.
[07:35.800 --> 07:37.040]  So you just get up off the toilet.
[07:37.360 --> 07:40.920]  Two people lift you up and like kind of hike your legs up as if they carry you.
[07:40.920 --> 07:44.240]  But you don't even know what they're for.
[07:44.460 --> 07:45.600]  They whip off the underwear.
[07:45.660 --> 07:46.560]  They put on new underwear.
[07:46.640 --> 07:47.540]  They knuckle the balls.
[07:47.960 --> 07:49.700]  Maybe flip the shaft to get all the drips off.
[07:50.220 --> 07:51.560]  Flip the shaft.
[07:51.860 --> 07:53.160]  Like flick it. Yeah.
[07:54.180 --> 07:54.980]  It's like Bop-It.
[07:55.420 --> 07:58.660]  Every time you talk about your pig situation, it sounds like a game of Bop-It.
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.880]  You got to twist the balls.
[07:59.940 --> 08:00.760]  You got to flick them.
[08:00.860 --> 08:02.500]  You got to reverse it out.
[08:02.600 --> 08:03.620]  How old are you, Andrew?
[08:04.020 --> 08:05.080]  30. All right.
[08:05.100 --> 08:07.620]  In about 11 years, you're going to be playing Bop-It 2.
[08:07.720 --> 08:08.460]  You'll understand.
[08:09.040 --> 08:09.560]  Bop-It 2.
[08:09.560 --> 08:10.860]  I've been waiting for Bop-It 2.
[08:11.040 --> 08:15.240]  It sounds like once you're done pissing, you just walk away from the situation.
[08:15.400 --> 08:17.280]  You're doing nothing to the old business.
[08:17.760 --> 08:18.000]  Yeah.
[08:18.880 --> 08:20.320]  You don't even need to give it a shake.
[08:20.700 --> 08:22.820]  Well, I mean, you always need to do a little bit of shaking.
[08:22.980 --> 08:24.980]  It's fun. Hip action in there.
[08:25.780 --> 08:27.540]  It's great at hula hooping in the day.
[08:27.800 --> 08:28.920]  Wait, you're shaking your...
[08:28.920 --> 08:30.600]  You're not shaking your penis with your hand.
[08:30.640 --> 08:31.440]  You're shaking your body.
[08:31.820 --> 08:32.920]  I'm doing a full shake.
[08:33.100 --> 08:34.500]  I'm getting in there.
[08:34.660 --> 08:37.280]  You're like a dog getting out of a pool.
[08:37.700 --> 08:39.660]  No, I'm not shaking that much.
[08:39.760 --> 08:42.240]  No, that would be...
[08:42.240 --> 08:44.880]  You're risking a large splash zone in that scenario.
[08:45.100 --> 08:46.880]  We're talking... I don't know.
[08:47.120 --> 08:48.540]  I don't know how I'd describe it.
[08:48.700 --> 08:50.500]  It's like a 1.2 on the Richter scale.
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.720]  This isn't a full earthquake.
[08:52.060 --> 08:52.900]  It is. You know what?
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.300]  Yeah, that's the way, Geoff.
[08:54.380 --> 08:55.500]  That's the perfect scale.
[08:55.720 --> 08:58.000]  We're talking a 1.2, at most 1.4.
[08:58.400 --> 08:58.660]  Nice.
[08:59.440 --> 09:00.800]  Do you do the tuck when you sit down?
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.840]  The tuck when I sit down? No.
[09:03.280 --> 09:07.120]  So does your penis just like clatter the toilet seat when you sit down on it?
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.220]  I mean, listen, I don't put a lot of thought into it.
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.160]  It can go a lot of ways.
[09:12.520 --> 09:13.980]  And sometimes that's the joy in life.
[09:15.820 --> 09:17.040]  You don't know what's coming.
[09:18.320 --> 09:19.120]  Keep you on your toes.
[09:19.640 --> 09:20.760]  Keep you on your toes.
[09:21.740 --> 09:23.540]  Live life to the fullest.
[09:23.960 --> 09:24.680]  Don't game plan.
[09:25.660 --> 09:26.640]  See what happens.
[09:27.440 --> 09:29.500]  Do a little 1.2 on the Richter scale.
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.280]  Nothing wrong with that.
[09:33.500 --> 09:36.120]  Do you not do a full body body wiggle?
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.060]  Yeah, I'm always worried I'm going to break the toilet seat if I do that.
[09:40.460 --> 09:42.720]  Oh, that's you know, you just get a new one.
[09:43.420 --> 09:45.500]  Yeah. Don't you have a broken toilet seat?
[09:45.760 --> 09:47.740]  Not right now. I have had one.
[09:48.080 --> 09:49.160]  I had broken toilet seats.
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.320]  It's probably from all the wiggling.
[09:51.280 --> 09:54.860]  Last time I moved, I broke it on the day of the move.
[09:55.380 --> 09:56.160]  That was an ideal.
[09:56.780 --> 09:57.700]  I said to leave money.
[09:58.040 --> 09:59.800]  Wait, you moved your toilet seat?
[10:00.080 --> 10:04.580]  No, I was cleaning stuff in the bathroom and I decided to sit on it,
[10:04.580 --> 10:07.780]  lid down, and it was not, I guess, positioned for that.
[10:08.240 --> 10:09.320]  And I cracked the lid.
[10:10.060 --> 10:13.720]  And it was like they were moving in like three hours from that point.
[10:13.820 --> 10:15.260]  So there's no time to replace it.
[10:15.480 --> 10:18.440]  So I just left. I left cash to replace it.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.300]  I love the idea of moving into a house and buy every little thing
[10:25.300 --> 10:27.700]  that sucks about the house is a small pile of cash.
[10:28.360 --> 10:30.880]  Here's 80 bucks. Get that latch fixed.
[10:31.880 --> 10:34.220]  That's sort of the process of selling a home, right?
[10:34.220 --> 10:37.300]  We're like, they get the inspector to come in and then tell you a bunch of stuff
[10:37.300 --> 10:39.500]  they want done. Yeah, it's terrible.
[10:39.700 --> 10:40.700]  It's an awful process.
[10:41.280 --> 10:42.760]  It truly is awful.
[10:43.020 --> 10:45.440]  And you find out you've been living in a house
[10:45.440 --> 10:47.300]  that should have been condemned years ago somehow.
[10:47.520 --> 10:50.060]  Yeah. Yeah. Everything is wrong.
[10:50.300 --> 10:53.740]  And to me, the worst feeling is like getting all that stuff back in working order
[10:53.740 --> 10:56.440]  and then being like, I wish I'd done that when I was living here.
[10:56.640 --> 10:58.680]  Yeah. Keying in with what Andrew said.
[10:58.740 --> 11:01.400]  The worst part about selling that house I just got rid of last year
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.380]  was that I had to get it in such we had to get it in such pristine shape.
[11:05.500 --> 11:07.880]  It never looked or worked better.
[11:08.420 --> 11:10.440]  You know, the fridge was finally in.
[11:10.580 --> 11:11.900]  The AC was replaced.
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.520]  All the pipes were fixed.
[11:13.700 --> 11:15.880]  I fixed the fucking foundation.
[11:16.060 --> 11:17.800]  I jacked the house up so it was even.
[11:17.920 --> 11:21.240]  I got the windows that fell out of the wall because of the heat.
[11:21.460 --> 11:26.400]  Like I was about to say, it was had the library with the shelving,
[11:26.620 --> 11:29.260]  you know, like it was finally just like, hmm.
[11:29.260 --> 11:31.980]  And you like now somebody can buy it.
[11:32.300 --> 11:34.620]  Perfect. You had melting windows, right?
[11:34.700 --> 11:37.700]  That was the thing. Yeah, those are melted out of the wall.
[11:38.260 --> 11:39.140]  Gets hot in Texas.
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.100]  Maybe the best practice is that after you've lived in a house a year,
[11:42.400 --> 11:45.380]  just pretend you're selling it to yourself, order a home inspection
[11:45.380 --> 11:46.620]  and then get everything fixed.
[11:46.860 --> 11:47.760]  That's a great idea.
[11:47.980 --> 11:51.460]  And then you can have a solid next five years without having to do anything.
[11:51.840 --> 11:53.240]  That's a great life tip, Evan.
[11:53.660 --> 11:54.660]  Life hacks are back.
[11:55.240 --> 11:56.360]  That is, you know what?
[11:56.380 --> 11:58.100]  I would fully endorse that life hack.
[11:58.100 --> 12:00.200]  Hiring a home inspector just for you.
[12:00.400 --> 12:01.260]  That's great.
[12:02.880 --> 12:04.560]  Evaluate, see what's going on.
[12:04.700 --> 12:05.860]  Got stuff to fix.
[12:06.360 --> 12:09.960]  I've been thinking about in terms of, you know, like doing stuff for yourself.
[12:10.500 --> 12:12.440]  Can we just start our own time zone?
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.440]  We wanted regulation time.
[12:14.600 --> 12:16.180]  We just make our own time, right?
[12:16.240 --> 12:17.380]  Would we all be in it?
[12:17.720 --> 12:22.560]  Yeah. Like if we all set our clocks to our own time,
[12:22.940 --> 12:24.760]  couldn't we just create our own time zone?
[12:24.760 --> 12:29.320]  Like a non-geographically dependent time zone that only we follow.
[12:30.280 --> 12:31.100]  I love it.
[12:31.580 --> 12:35.460]  Oh, so it would really just be you changing your clocks, Andrew.
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.320]  Yeah, Andrew becomes central time.
[12:38.920 --> 12:40.480]  Or we change ours to him.
[12:40.800 --> 12:41.580]  Or we meet in the middle.
[12:42.120 --> 12:43.600]  Nah, Andrew changes the central time.
[12:43.860 --> 12:44.980]  Nah, it's easier this way.
[12:45.380 --> 12:47.140]  Oh, what happened to before we recorded, Eric?
[12:47.260 --> 12:49.500]  Mr. PST is the only time zone.
[12:49.620 --> 12:51.180]  It is. Now all of a sudden we change.
[12:51.180 --> 12:53.440]  But now I'm here, so you have to change.
[12:55.340 --> 12:58.920]  I think... I was thinking about if I was in a town,
[12:59.360 --> 13:02.600]  if I ran a town, if I was a mayor, as I believe the official title,
[13:03.340 --> 13:06.900]  I would have... I think like the time zone should change yearly.
[13:07.520 --> 13:10.520]  I think there should be a yearly discussion about what time zone
[13:10.520 --> 13:11.940]  you all collectively are in.
[13:12.380 --> 13:13.780]  I think you just adjust the clocks.
[13:14.340 --> 13:15.180]  Just for the town?
[13:15.640 --> 13:18.340]  Yeah, I'm not really worried about people outside of it.
[13:18.380 --> 13:19.300]  I'm the mayor of the town.
[13:19.400 --> 13:20.900]  I'm not worried about the next town over.
[13:21.280 --> 13:22.400]  Yeah, that's their problem.
[13:22.400 --> 13:26.320]  So you're but you could basically just decide that the sun sets at 3 p.m.
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.500]  Yeah. If that's what we feel is optimal as a community,
[13:31.640 --> 13:33.080]  I don't see why not.
[13:33.380 --> 13:35.600]  I'm trying to think of what that would actually affect.
[13:36.040 --> 13:37.880]  I think you do a poll.
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.120]  You at every year you do a poll in your community
[13:42.700 --> 13:46.440]  and you decide how far the clocks go forward or back each year.
[13:46.680 --> 13:48.020]  If at all. If at all.
[13:48.380 --> 13:49.940]  Maybe they stay. Maybe we found it.
[13:50.020 --> 13:50.860]  Maybe we locked in.
[13:50.860 --> 13:52.740]  Everyone's really liking this time.
[13:53.080 --> 13:56.340]  But if the clocks go forwards, if the clocks go back five hours,
[13:56.900 --> 14:00.540]  wouldn't that be like Y2K levels of computers going wrong?
[14:00.880 --> 14:01.340]  In what way?
[14:01.840 --> 14:04.120]  Well, that potentially you would have files
[14:04.760 --> 14:08.500]  that are older that were before the newer ones.
[14:08.660 --> 14:10.180]  What? I don't know.
[14:10.280 --> 14:12.120]  You're the one trying to convey this to me. I'm listening.
[14:12.400 --> 14:14.180]  Oh, boy. Paying full attention.
[14:14.340 --> 14:15.420]  I'm trying to absorb what you're saying.
[14:15.660 --> 14:19.100]  Like you would be having so many so many things happening twice that day.
[14:20.360 --> 14:23.140]  Like you would look back and be like, oh, that happened at 2 p.m.
[14:23.140 --> 14:24.940]  on a Sunday. All right. Which 2 p.m.?
[14:24.940 --> 14:27.900]  You're only paying attention to your town clock, though.
[14:28.200 --> 14:29.420]  You're only locked in on yours.
[14:29.520 --> 14:30.820]  You're not worried about anyone around you.
[14:31.020 --> 14:32.400]  That's the outside world's problem.
[14:32.900 --> 14:37.020]  Yeah. If you can, if you stay contained to your community's time,
[14:37.640 --> 14:39.060]  they have to adjust to you.
[14:39.400 --> 14:42.620]  If you adjusted five hours, then you've you're the one who changed.
[14:43.100 --> 14:44.020]  Yeah, we've changed.
[14:44.140 --> 14:46.360]  And now everyone else has to adapt to our change.
[14:46.780 --> 14:48.660]  All right. So, hey, meet me at 10 a.m.
[14:48.660 --> 14:49.880]  on Monday. Yeah.
[14:50.440 --> 14:52.740]  OK. But the but the clocks went back five hours.
[14:52.940 --> 14:56.880]  Yeah. Well, I'm aware because, you know, it happens once a year on a certain day.
[14:57.040 --> 14:59.320]  Yeah. But which which 10 a.m. are we meeting at?
[14:59.780 --> 15:02.460]  The official one. The official one of that time.
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.640]  Yeah. Whatever the clock is now, whatever is deemed to be the time is the time.
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.600]  And how do we determine the time if the time jumped back five hours?
[15:10.760 --> 15:13.040]  Which time? Because we know we'd be notified.
[15:13.320 --> 15:14.360]  Yeah, but city time.
[15:14.360 --> 15:16.760]  No, what I'm saying is if the time changed,
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.040]  it's a time shift after 10, right? Right.
[15:20.360 --> 15:22.480]  But we met at 10 that day. Right.
[15:22.840 --> 15:23.780]  Which 10 are we meet at?
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.280]  The 10 that it currently is.
[15:25.720 --> 15:27.640]  There's no currently is. It's in the future.
[15:27.760 --> 15:28.860]  All of it's in the future now.
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.980]  Now, OK, so you're saying that, let's say on Friday and the clock switch on Saturday,
[15:33.800 --> 15:35.300]  we're going to meet at 10 on Saturday.
[15:36.660 --> 15:38.400]  Well, I said Monday, but sure. Yeah.
[15:38.460 --> 15:39.260]  OK, now it's Saturday.
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.200]  Yeah. I prefer Saturday.
[15:41.300 --> 15:42.720]  I'm not a Monday guy. I'm Garfield.
[15:42.720 --> 15:45.100]  OK, let's meet at 10 on Saturday,
[15:45.660 --> 15:49.240]  except the clocks will go back five hours at two on Saturday.
[15:49.780 --> 15:51.340]  Let's meet at 10 on Saturday.
[15:51.480 --> 15:52.140]  What would you say? Yeah.
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.700]  Wake up on Saturday when it's 10.
[15:54.760 --> 15:56.240]  We'll all be there. Yeah. Which 10?
[15:56.800 --> 15:59.340]  The 10 that currently is because the clock's flipped over.
[16:01.640 --> 16:02.720]  The clock's changed.
[16:03.440 --> 16:03.960]  What do you mean?
[16:04.820 --> 16:05.780]  The clock's changed.
[16:06.180 --> 16:07.440]  What do you mean? It hasn't changed yet.
[16:07.480 --> 16:08.540]  It's changing on Saturday.
[16:08.980 --> 16:10.500]  It's Saturday. I thought...
[16:10.500 --> 16:10.760]  I'm going to wait.
[16:12.720 --> 16:14.340]  OK, shut up.
[16:14.700 --> 16:16.760]  It's Friday, right?
[16:16.900 --> 16:18.360]  Hi, it's Friday. Hi, Andrew.
[16:19.420 --> 16:20.660]  Let's meet at 10 tomorrow.
[16:21.220 --> 16:22.500]  At 10? OK, sounds good.
[16:22.600 --> 16:25.700]  But tomorrow at 2 p.m., the clocks go back five hours.
[16:26.040 --> 16:28.100]  All right. Let's meet at 10 tomorrow. All right.
[16:28.140 --> 16:29.800]  OK, 10 tomorrow. OK, got it.
[16:30.040 --> 16:31.400]  So when are you showing up?
[16:31.540 --> 16:33.940]  When the it says 10 on the clock's changed.
[16:35.620 --> 16:39.840]  Nobody. Well, to be fair, nobody's changing the clocks at 2 p.m., Gav.
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.360]  It's going to be done at midnight, just like when we do with Central Standard Time.
[16:43.520 --> 16:45.720]  Yeah, but what if midnight is lunchtime?
[16:46.440 --> 16:47.980]  It's Andrew's goof world.
[16:48.400 --> 16:49.460]  That doesn't make any sense.
[16:50.440 --> 16:52.280]  Well, no. So you...
[16:52.280 --> 16:54.720]  And he still won't answer the question, which 10 are you meeting me at?
[16:54.840 --> 16:58.300]  OK, I'm meeting you at the time that it currently is.
[16:58.580 --> 17:00.320]  Whatever the time that it currently is.
[17:00.540 --> 17:01.140]  On that day.
[17:01.940 --> 17:05.420]  It's tomorrow. You know how your phone, it just updates how your clock just updates
[17:05.420 --> 17:08.340]  on your phone, if it's daylight savings, daylight, whatever.
[17:08.520 --> 17:09.600]  Let me run you through it. Let me run you through it.
[17:09.600 --> 17:12.600]  OK, it's 9 a.m. on Saturday, right?
[17:13.160 --> 17:17.160]  OK. OK, 9, 10, 11.
[17:17.160 --> 17:19.040]  Now I'd go. Oh, no, no, it'd be 10.
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.600]  Oh, OK, OK.
[17:21.060 --> 17:24.280]  You went at 10. OK, 11, 12.
[17:24.820 --> 17:26.640]  Well, wait, were we spending two hours together?
[17:27.680 --> 17:28.800]  Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
[17:29.520 --> 17:31.120]  You went there at 10, right?
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.900]  OK. Then it's 11.
[17:34.200 --> 17:36.120]  Then it's 12. Are you here yet?
[17:36.360 --> 17:36.820]  Then it's 1.
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.280]  Are we together this whole time or am I still waiting for you?
[17:42.900 --> 17:44.380]  Because I was I showed up at 10.
[17:44.700 --> 17:45.580]  Now it's one o'clock. You ready?
[17:46.380 --> 17:47.380]  Yeah. All right. Now it's nine.
[17:48.720 --> 17:49.520]  Now it's 10.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.820]  Now, do you see the point?
[17:53.500 --> 17:56.240]  No, I don't. Because we met. Oh, God.
[17:56.380 --> 17:57.640]  We met on the day.
[17:58.360 --> 18:02.120]  On the day that the clock you meet on the day the clock is.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.780]  The clock was. It was the day.
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.300]  Yeah, but then it changes.
[18:07.820 --> 18:15.280]  But if if you and I meet at at noon or midnight, right?
[18:15.840 --> 18:18.000]  And then the clocks go back at two.
[18:18.440 --> 18:20.120]  Yeah. In two hours.
[18:20.920 --> 18:22.340]  We still met at midnight.
[18:22.560 --> 18:24.160]  It's just now midnight's different.
[18:25.600 --> 18:26.840]  Wait, is that good?
[18:27.640 --> 18:32.120]  So if we meet right and we spend we spend, let's say it's one.
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.940]  What time does the clocks go back?
[18:33.960 --> 18:35.540]  Is it one to one?
[18:35.540 --> 18:39.880]  It was two in my example, and it was going to go back five hours.
[18:40.140 --> 18:43.420]  Yeah, but I'm just saying in real life that we currently live.
[18:44.400 --> 18:48.580]  I experienced daylight savings and the clock going forward and the clock going back.
[18:49.060 --> 18:50.860]  What is that? That is that two a.m.?
[18:50.860 --> 18:52.280]  Yeah, it happens like one, two in the morning.
[18:52.700 --> 18:56.360]  Isn't it two? Yeah, I think it'll be like it'll be like one fifty nine one.
[18:56.580 --> 18:57.860]  Or it'd be like one fifty nine three.
[18:58.340 --> 19:02.400]  So if we meet at one and then it goes to two and then it goes back to one
[19:02.400 --> 19:03.740]  and we've spent two hours together.
[19:03.740 --> 19:06.020]  Isn't that the same thing is what you're saying?
[19:08.300 --> 19:08.860]  No.
[19:12.160 --> 19:13.960]  Does anyone else know what I'm saying?
[19:14.500 --> 19:15.400]  Can someone help me?
[19:16.160 --> 19:17.600]  Here's here's what I can help.
[19:17.920 --> 19:23.320]  I can help in the unlikely event that for some reason in this town,
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.060]  we do the time flip over in the middle of the fucking day.
[19:27.440 --> 19:31.660]  It could potentially cause some confusion for people like Gavin
[19:31.660 --> 19:34.960]  who are having difficulty adapting to the new way of doing things.
[19:35.060 --> 19:39.180]  I understand that it's a very temporary and minor confusion
[19:39.180 --> 19:42.640]  that would be caused on a morning of one day, one day a year.
[19:42.640 --> 19:46.180]  And I would think during that day we would use colloquially
[19:47.460 --> 19:50.960]  colloquially, we would just say new new ten or old ten.
[19:51.580 --> 19:54.440]  I see. OK, is that how it would work in Andrew's goof world?
[19:54.740 --> 19:55.600]  Yeah, you say so.
[19:55.700 --> 19:58.420]  So if it's potential that there could be two ten o'clock on the Saturday,
[19:58.740 --> 20:00.320]  you could say old ten, new ten.
[20:00.320 --> 20:01.280]  Back to me in the mirror.
[20:01.440 --> 20:03.480]  I'd say, Gavin, I've heard your I've heard your complaint.
[20:03.620 --> 20:05.240]  I've heard your confusion. Yeah.
[20:05.580 --> 20:08.040]  This will only happen at midnight.
[20:08.540 --> 20:13.140]  Right. But like you've if if the year before you decided
[20:13.140 --> 20:16.560]  we're eight hours behind, yeah, then midnight could be it.
[20:16.560 --> 20:18.100]  Like the sun is up.
[20:18.180 --> 20:21.000]  It's like the equivalent of 4 p.m. So what do you mean? Yeah.
[20:22.760 --> 20:23.140]  Well, midnight.
[20:25.700 --> 20:26.500]  OK. Right.
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.640]  The day I don't know what the sun has to do with midnight.
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.240]  I was just trying to give you the simple like it's like two people meet for lunch.
[20:32.260 --> 20:35.260]  Right. I'm it's actually going to affect like what times your flight.
[20:35.620 --> 20:37.760]  What about this bank transfer? Like all that shit.
[20:37.980 --> 20:40.420]  Yeah, I'm not you're you're worried about stuff outside of the town.
[20:40.600 --> 20:43.100]  I'm I'm I'm focused on the town day to day living.
[20:43.340 --> 20:45.040]  It's no there's no bank in the town.
[20:45.300 --> 20:47.180]  It's a town bank. So it's on town time.
[20:50.060 --> 20:53.220]  So the bank would move backwards in time five hours.
[20:53.580 --> 20:55.220]  Yeah. All right. In the town.
[20:55.600 --> 20:57.600]  OK, we're in town time. Yeah.
[20:59.020 --> 21:01.340]  Yeah. Yeah.
[21:01.760 --> 21:03.760]  I don't know what the confusion is. Yeah.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.240]  I apologize. You just save the time.
[21:08.460 --> 21:11.560]  You just you just say the time.
[21:11.920 --> 21:14.980]  Maybe we'll get you use the the regulation clock
[21:14.980 --> 21:17.420]  and it keeps everything updated for you. Look at the clock.
[21:18.020 --> 21:21.000]  You know, when the clock says that number, you go there.
[21:21.440 --> 21:25.240]  My point, my point was that it would say that number twice.
[21:25.820 --> 21:27.480]  Yeah. New time, old time. It's fine.
[21:27.990 --> 21:29.380]  It's only going to happen one day a year.
[21:29.680 --> 21:32.700]  Yeah. And maybe instead of a.m. p.m., we do N.T. O.T.
[21:33.100 --> 21:36.180]  I don't think you give the townspeople in regulation town enough credit
[21:36.180 --> 21:38.640]  for being able to handle a minor time hiccup.
[21:38.940 --> 21:42.900]  Yeah, I can say based on this conversation, Gavin's not living in regulation town.
[21:43.200 --> 21:44.660]  Yeah, I don't. He's very opposed.
[21:44.900 --> 21:46.620]  I want nothing to do with your regulation town.
[21:46.780 --> 21:49.860]  You don't want to live in Andrew's goof world? Come on.
[21:51.520 --> 21:53.920]  So you would vote against the yearly time change?
[21:54.420 --> 21:59.980]  Yeah, I mean, I hate daylight savings is now when it's one hour, two in the morning.
[22:00.040 --> 22:02.320]  And so you can fix it. Make it nine in the morning.
[22:04.520 --> 22:09.520]  You can take whatever time you want, as long as you can convince a plurality of town folk.
[22:09.680 --> 22:13.820]  My point was just we could all just decide we're living on another time and nobody could stop us.
[22:14.040 --> 22:15.320]  I completely agree with you.
[22:15.700 --> 22:17.840]  This is the thing you think about. This is the thing to consider.
[22:18.240 --> 22:21.660]  So if it was like, hey, regulation recording at three, we would just know what time that is.
[22:22.040 --> 22:23.640]  Yeah. And you would be there at three
[22:23.640 --> 22:26.680]  and we would be there at three. Yeah, because it's regulation three time.
[22:28.240 --> 22:30.740]  Maybe three in the real world is four p.m.
[22:31.260 --> 22:33.560]  Maybe it's six a.m. Who knows?
[22:34.020 --> 22:35.440]  It's the joy of regulation time.
[22:35.740 --> 22:37.220]  Let's try it. Let's try it for a week.
[22:37.600 --> 22:38.940]  Oh, no, thank you.
[22:39.440 --> 22:40.760]  Yeah, there's no way, Eric.
[22:40.860 --> 22:42.460]  Well, hold on. We can vote on it.
[22:42.920 --> 22:44.880]  Yeah, I vote. I think it's here's the thing.
[22:44.980 --> 22:48.240]  I think it's difficult because Nick has kids.
[22:48.900 --> 22:52.420]  Kid. That he knows about. Nick has kid.
[22:52.420 --> 22:57.820]  Oh, wait. Nick has kid and kid doesn't live on regulation time.
[22:58.180 --> 23:00.140]  We're not in regulation town.
[23:00.280 --> 23:01.720]  So I feel like it would be difficult.
[23:02.180 --> 23:03.440]  But how much is Nick's kid?
[23:03.560 --> 23:05.720]  You really need everybody on board.
[23:05.900 --> 23:07.900]  You can't really accomplish this.
[23:08.300 --> 23:11.160]  But Nick's kid, I assume, doesn't refer that often to the time.
[23:11.720 --> 23:15.320]  He might be the easiest to adapt to regulation time out of all of us.
[23:15.640 --> 23:17.420]  Well, no, he has a schedule.
[23:17.940 --> 23:19.580]  Nick's kid has things they got to do.
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.820]  That's true. Meeting people, doing stuff.
[23:23.240 --> 23:24.420]  You're still going to do all that.
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.700]  I'd miss soccer practice if I lived like if I was Nick's kid age.
[23:29.960 --> 23:31.880]  I wouldn't want to miss soccer practice,
[23:31.960 --> 23:34.980]  but soccer practice is not aligning with regulation time.
[23:35.540 --> 23:37.200]  I was Nick's kid age.
[23:37.860 --> 23:41.520]  Yeah, I was playing soccer at Nick's kid age.
[23:42.220 --> 23:44.040]  Why are you saying it like that?
[23:44.480 --> 23:45.140]  Nick's kid age.
[23:46.740 --> 23:49.120]  So anyway, you guys went to pinball or something?
[23:49.120 --> 23:50.460]  You're in a museum in Vegas.
[23:52.200 --> 23:53.060]  What happened?
[23:56.570 --> 23:57.990]  I think we've all been there.
[23:58.330 --> 24:00.650]  Booking a doctor appointment can just feel so daunting
[24:00.650 --> 24:03.370]  and can be a massive headache to just start the process.
[24:03.570 --> 24:05.090]  It can feel incredibly daunting.
[24:05.430 --> 24:08.230]  But thanks to ZocDoc, there's no reason to delay.
[24:08.670 --> 24:11.730]  They make it so easy to find and book a doctor who's right for you.
[24:12.250 --> 24:15.510]  ZocDoc is a free app and website where you can search and pair high quality
[24:15.510 --> 24:19.050]  in-network doctors and click to instantly book an appointment.
[24:19.050 --> 24:21.230]  We're talking about booking in-network appointments
[24:21.230 --> 24:24.850]  with more than 100,000 doctors across every specialty.
[24:25.330 --> 24:27.090]  With a range like that, you know you'll be covered.
[24:27.470 --> 24:31.210]  We're talking from mental health to dental health, primary care to urgent care
[24:31.210 --> 24:33.790]  and more. The range is incredible.
[24:34.310 --> 24:37.310]  You can filter for doctors who take your insurance, are located nearby,
[24:37.790 --> 24:41.110]  are a good fit for any medical need you may have and are highly rated
[24:41.110 --> 24:42.650]  by verified patients.

[24:54.970 --> 24:58.470]  you need. And with ZocDoc appointments, they happen fast.
[24:58.670 --> 25:00.330]  The last thing you want is a long wait.

[25:03.450 --> 25:06.230]  you can even score same day appointments, which is so important.
[25:06.610 --> 25:08.670]  If this is something I needed, I'd use ZocDoc.
[25:09.050 --> 25:12.430]  Stop putting off those doctor appointments and go to ZocDoc.com
[25:12.430 --> 25:16.630]  slash regulation to find and instantly book a top rated doctor today.

[25:22.390 --> 25:24.570]  ZocDoc.com slash regulation.
[25:26.670 --> 25:28.490]  I've been waiting to hear about this Vegas thing.
[25:28.790 --> 25:30.350]  We did. We took Gavin to...
[25:30.350 --> 25:34.090]  I think Gavin is very quietly a big fan of pinball, which
[25:34.090 --> 25:38.730]  that was an adult onset addiction, I believe, right?
[25:38.770 --> 25:40.050]  Like you came into that kind of late in life.
[25:40.310 --> 25:44.590]  Oh, yeah. I'd only ever played Space Cadet Pinball on Windows XP.
[25:44.590 --> 25:47.130]  And how did you feel about Space Cadet Pinball?
[25:47.510 --> 25:48.070]  Loved it.
[25:48.410 --> 25:50.890]  Were you... it intrigued you, made you want to try real pinball?
[25:51.330 --> 25:55.370]  I tried real pinball with Ed Robertson for the first time.
[25:55.710 --> 25:56.890]  And that you were hooked.
[25:57.250 --> 25:57.690]  Who's that?
[25:57.990 --> 26:00.630]  I like... I mean, maybe it's because I like slammer,
[26:00.690 --> 26:02.690]  but I just like really quick moving mechanical shit.
[26:05.010 --> 26:06.050]  We were...
[26:06.050 --> 26:12.090]  On Sunday night, we went to find this gambling machine
[26:12.090 --> 26:14.170]  that Eric wanted to check out.
[26:14.390 --> 26:15.490]  Eric, how old was that thing?
[26:15.550 --> 26:16.350]  Do you know when it was from?
[26:16.690 --> 26:20.650]  The 60s, I think it's called Sigma Derby,
[26:20.770 --> 26:23.070]  and it's only at the D in Vegas.
[26:23.230 --> 26:27.190]  It's the very last one of this stupid 60s horse game.
[26:27.970 --> 26:29.370]  It's... I love it. I love it.
[26:29.410 --> 26:34.110]  It's basically like mechanical horse racing where you hit a button and they go
[26:34.110 --> 26:35.050]  and then you... Yeah, there you go.
[26:35.070 --> 26:35.610]  There's a picture of it.
[26:35.630 --> 26:37.550]  And you bet on who you think is going to win.
[26:37.870 --> 26:41.310]  And that thing required an employee...
[26:41.310 --> 26:46.230]  How many? Let's say six, eight, probably ten seats you can sit at to bet.
[26:46.350 --> 26:50.510]  Yep. And there were always nine seats full of people betting
[26:50.510 --> 26:55.150]  and one seat full of a 92 year old man who was fixing it.
[26:55.250 --> 26:59.250]  And then as soon as he would fix one, then another one across the way
[26:59.250 --> 27:01.110]  would break and he would go over and fix that.
[27:01.230 --> 27:04.270]  He had a taped, like a printed out label that says
[27:06.030 --> 27:07.210]  not working or whatever.
[27:07.210 --> 27:09.450]  And he would just peel it off the one he's working on and go over
[27:09.450 --> 27:10.370]  and stick it on the new one.
[27:10.370 --> 27:12.250]  And everybody would just play musical chairs.
[27:12.330 --> 27:14.410]  And it wasn't because they were all broken at the same time.
[27:14.490 --> 27:17.670]  It's because one of them broke as soon as one of them got fixed.
[27:17.770 --> 27:21.850]  And it seemed like this never ending cycle of this guy fixing.
[27:22.030 --> 27:24.250]  And then Eric, Eric had to sit... There's Eric playing.
[27:25.030 --> 27:27.790]  I didn't sit, I stood the whole goddamn time.
[27:27.970 --> 27:30.470]  That's at his second location, because the first location,
[27:30.470 --> 27:33.030]  he had to wait till it got fixed and then it got fixed
[27:33.030 --> 27:36.230]  and then it broke while he was using it and then it got fixed again
[27:36.230 --> 27:37.910]  and then it broke while he was using it again.
[27:38.010 --> 27:39.070]  So he moved to a different one.
[27:39.070 --> 27:41.690]  But the whole time, this guy, this very old man
[27:41.690 --> 27:44.430]  who's probably the only person alive who knows how to repair this machine
[27:44.770 --> 27:45.890]  just keeps going from it.
[27:45.910 --> 27:47.190]  And he has to, like, lift the top up.
[27:47.270 --> 27:49.930]  And as soon as he lifts the top up, Gavin's head is in there
[27:49.930 --> 27:52.450]  looking at the wiring, trying to understand what's going on and how it works.
[27:52.770 --> 27:54.850]  We haven't wanted. He was fascinated by it.
[27:55.170 --> 27:57.150]  He would lift up the flap and there'd be a bunch of wires
[27:57.150 --> 27:57.930]  that he would move out the way.
[27:58.030 --> 28:00.270]  And then you'd hear his hand like shoving coins.
[28:00.410 --> 28:02.990]  It's like the coins were piling up so much.
[28:03.010 --> 28:04.390]  It was like shorting out the machine.
[28:04.870 --> 28:08.290]  And then it was just musical chairs of like Eric getting up from a thing
[28:08.290 --> 28:11.030]  that just broke, the guy sitting where Eric was, Eric going to the one
[28:11.030 --> 28:11.830]  the guy just fixed.
[28:12.070 --> 28:15.090]  And somehow everyone else was just sat in the same spot the whole time.
[28:15.470 --> 28:17.890]  Yeah, there there were just a couple of spots that kept breaking
[28:17.890 --> 28:19.210]  and breaking and breaking and breaking.
[28:19.530 --> 28:22.230]  And then it was like, I don't know, but also one of the guys was a fan.
[28:22.250 --> 28:23.350]  So he got to talk to Gavin.
[28:23.390 --> 28:26.130]  And I think I think that's Gavin's in for his next career move
[28:26.130 --> 28:27.550]  to just fix these in Vegas.
[28:28.050 --> 28:31.610]  I just think it'd be fascinating to be on the inside of that machine,
[28:31.690 --> 28:32.910]  like right under where the horses are.
[28:33.010 --> 28:34.850]  I want to see how that works. Looks great.
[28:35.330 --> 28:37.350]  It's it's such a fun game. I love it.
[28:37.350 --> 28:41.450]  There's like a newer version, but like I was talking to Gavin about it.
[28:41.530 --> 28:47.110]  I don't trust like video roulette and stuff just feels like the physical thing,
[28:47.230 --> 28:51.010]  even though it's controlled by some computer, I guess in this case or whatever.
[28:51.390 --> 28:54.070]  The physical thing is like the important piece to me
[28:54.070 --> 28:57.950]  because it feels like you have that sense of like I'm involved, whatever.
[28:58.710 --> 29:02.850]  The newer ones have a lot of it's just it's all computer, whatever.
[29:02.850 --> 29:07.610]  This is these dumb fucking horses move.
[29:08.930 --> 29:10.750]  They're so herky jerky.
[29:10.990 --> 29:15.570]  And it's so much fun to bet just quarters like you just bet like a dollar
[29:15.570 --> 29:20.150]  50 at a time on like what it's it's you bet like the first two horses
[29:20.150 --> 29:22.510]  to cross the line and you're trying you're like, all right,
[29:22.510 --> 29:26.570]  I'm going to put like 50 cents on one, two, and then like three, five.
[29:26.670 --> 29:28.910]  I'm going to put a full dollar on and you're just trying to play the odds.
[29:29.010 --> 29:30.150]  It's so fun.
[29:30.150 --> 29:33.770]  I even bought a little mechanical one that I have at the office now
[29:33.770 --> 29:36.210]  that does horse races that we can play.
[29:36.750 --> 29:38.850]  Did you did you finish positive?
[29:39.430 --> 29:42.010]  No, no, no, no, no, I won.
[29:42.190 --> 29:42.970]  I won hardly ever.
[29:43.090 --> 29:47.330]  I love the long shot bets because I want something to pay out 48 to one.
[29:47.530 --> 29:50.230]  But you have to bet like the three to one, two to one
[29:50.230 --> 29:53.550]  like consistently to get anything.
[29:53.670 --> 29:54.330]  So it's a real bummer.
[29:54.610 --> 29:55.630]  I completely agree with you, Eric.
[29:55.650 --> 29:59.470]  There's something that feels more real or there's like a gravity
[29:59.470 --> 30:04.810]  to a machine like that that's all mechanical and is old and looks heavy.
[30:05.130 --> 30:08.850]  And like it's been patchwork together for like the last 60 years to work.
[30:08.910 --> 30:11.350]  It's kind of like the difference between like it's kind of what I felt
[30:11.350 --> 30:13.610]  when I saw the Star Wars prequels for the first time
[30:13.610 --> 30:17.590]  and everything was smooth and beautiful and and and nice.
[30:17.730 --> 30:21.110]  And you're like, that's not what that's not what the everything's cobbled together
[30:21.110 --> 30:22.470]  and it's barely working in there.
[30:22.530 --> 30:23.210]  You know what I mean? Right.
[30:23.410 --> 30:24.870]  Like some analog junk.
[30:25.250 --> 30:27.810]  Yeah. And so I completely agree with you.
[30:27.810 --> 30:31.630]  There's something way it feels way more special to be at that machine
[30:31.630 --> 30:35.670]  than the fancy new 2015 one on the other side of the casino.
[30:35.910 --> 30:38.450]  And that's what I like about pinball is that even though
[30:38.970 --> 30:41.190]  there are now like massive rule sets and there's missions,
[30:41.250 --> 30:44.190]  there's a lot of like computers inside and there's like big digital screens
[30:44.190 --> 30:47.150]  and stuff, all the stuff on the play field is still mechanical.
[30:47.670 --> 30:48.570]  That's why I like it.
[30:48.830 --> 30:52.570]  It was so much fun going to that Pinball Hall of Fame
[30:52.570 --> 30:56.510]  and getting to a just browse through all the different pinball machines
[30:56.510 --> 30:59.610]  and realize how many there are, but also how many of them
[30:59.610 --> 31:00.730]  you're familiar with already.
[31:00.930 --> 31:04.510]  Like I saw my childhood pinball machine that I forgot existed.
[31:04.850 --> 31:05.970]  It's called Earthshaker.
[31:06.110 --> 31:08.110]  And I was so fucking excited to get to play it again.
[31:08.390 --> 31:12.410]  But it was even I think even more fun was watching Gavin have fun.
[31:12.430 --> 31:15.710]  Honestly, like he was a kid in a candy shop and you could and he would like
[31:15.710 --> 31:18.750]  go up to machine and he could tell you facts about certain machines
[31:18.750 --> 31:22.530]  and why this one was rare, less rare than this one, but more rare than another one.
[31:22.610 --> 31:24.730]  And he I don't know, it was really neat to watch him in his element.
[31:24.850 --> 31:25.490]  I really enjoyed it.
[31:25.490 --> 31:26.370]  That's fun.
[31:26.610 --> 31:27.650]  It was so fun.
[31:27.910 --> 31:28.610]  That looks great.
[31:28.910 --> 31:31.090]  I mean, like old mechanical stuff like that is awesome.
[31:31.210 --> 31:34.670]  I realized the second I set foot in the hotel
[31:34.670 --> 31:37.910]  we're staying at and all the hotels are like casinos walked in.
[31:38.110 --> 31:40.490]  And at that point I was like, oh, I forgot to bring money.
[31:42.230 --> 31:44.970]  I was going to say, did you try your roulette thing?
[31:45.330 --> 31:47.450]  Well, I didn't bring any debit cards or cash.
[31:47.450 --> 31:48.590]  I just brought my credit card.
[31:49.030 --> 31:52.430]  I had my British debit card because I just come from England.
[31:53.020 --> 31:55.830]  I was so jet lagged that whole trip, by the way, in Vegas.
[31:56.330 --> 31:57.830]  So I didn't have any of the stuff I needed.
[31:58.110 --> 32:00.710]  Your dude, that was that was crazy.
[32:01.010 --> 32:02.750]  Like, oh, my God.
[32:03.010 --> 32:07.470]  The first night we were at dinner and I was just looking at the time in England
[32:07.470 --> 32:08.450]  because that's what everybody felt.
[32:08.570 --> 32:10.150]  And I was like, oh, 5 a.m.
[32:10.190 --> 32:11.670]  We're just getting some steaks put down.
[32:12.010 --> 32:12.510]  It was rough.
[32:13.190 --> 32:16.470]  But on the very final night, right before we went to bed,
[32:17.090 --> 32:20.910]  Geoff lent me $100 and I went straight to roulette.
[32:20.910 --> 32:23.930]  And I thought, oh, I wonder if my losing streak is over.
[32:24.390 --> 32:25.490]  Put a hundred on black.
[32:26.590 --> 32:27.630]  $200, baby.
[32:28.210 --> 32:28.750]  Oh, you're back.
[32:29.130 --> 32:31.990]  I could very well be at the beginning of a new winning streak.
[32:32.490 --> 32:35.270]  What was even funnier about Gavin winning that $200
[32:35.270 --> 32:38.690]  is that right when he put the bet down, a community member came up
[32:38.690 --> 32:41.370]  and started talking to him and he didn't know that he'd won for a second
[32:41.370 --> 32:44.710]  because he was like shaking a hand or taking a photo or something.
[32:45.050 --> 32:46.170]  It was going on in the background.
[32:46.450 --> 32:49.150]  Yeah, I was taking a selfie that I went back to my my thing.
[32:49.150 --> 32:52.330]  I was like, oh, guess it guess it landed on black.
[32:53.950 --> 32:56.170]  What a way to learn that your streak is back.
[32:56.430 --> 32:58.170]  What else happened in Vegas that we need to talk about?
[32:58.290 --> 33:00.250]  Well, that's that that's what I was going to bring up.
[33:00.370 --> 33:04.270]  The Gavin mentioned having steaks at 5 a.m. for him.
[33:04.710 --> 33:08.210]  But we went to we went to a cool little steakhouse.
[33:08.610 --> 33:09.730]  Like old school.
[33:09.890 --> 33:11.070]  Oscars? It's called Oscars.
[33:11.150 --> 33:13.330]  Like old times. Felt like it was 1972 in there.
[33:13.370 --> 33:14.510]  It was in the plaza.
[33:14.690 --> 33:18.690]  And the guy who was like the owner used to be the mayor of Vegas
[33:18.690 --> 33:20.410]  and also is like in casino.
[33:20.790 --> 33:21.710]  It's a whole fucking thing.
[33:21.930 --> 33:22.550]  Oh, wow. OK.
[33:22.570 --> 33:24.890]  He was a mob lawyer before he was mayor.
[33:24.970 --> 33:26.610]  Crazy. We all got steaks.
[33:26.650 --> 33:27.970]  It was like a really nice time.
[33:28.110 --> 33:29.630]  Very cool. Like little dinner.
[33:30.030 --> 33:34.130]  We all got steaks, except Nick's wife, who just got a baked potato
[33:34.130 --> 33:37.990]  and was like going nuts about this baked potato.
[33:38.450 --> 33:41.550]  She's all about baked potatoes.
[33:41.830 --> 33:42.650]  What was that?
[33:42.950 --> 33:44.010]  She loves baked potatoes.
[33:44.210 --> 33:47.010]  Sometimes, you know, you go to a steakhouse, you want a steak.
[33:47.010 --> 33:51.690]  But my wife sometimes is very much like, I'm not really feeling the red meat today.
[33:51.710 --> 33:54.530]  So she was like, I'm just going to get this baked potato.
[33:54.930 --> 33:58.510]  And like the way we had ordered everything else was we all kind of ordered sides
[33:58.510 --> 34:01.390]  together. And she's like, this baked potato is mine.
[34:01.690 --> 34:02.450]  This one's me.
[34:02.970 --> 34:05.370]  This is my baked potato, and I will be getting it.
[34:05.710 --> 34:09.650]  And that led to the next portion of our conversation
[34:09.650 --> 34:11.550]  where it's like she's going to stick a flag in it.
[34:11.790 --> 34:12.870]  Yeah, kind of.
[34:14.370 --> 34:16.710]  Andrew, let me pitch you
[34:16.710 --> 34:17.270]  on an idea.
[34:17.630 --> 34:19.590]  OK, insane.
[34:20.050 --> 34:23.150]  Imagine, if you will, you're yourself.
[34:23.290 --> 34:26.030]  You're Andrew Pantin going about life, happy, go lucky.
[34:26.150 --> 34:27.270]  Everything's going well for you.
[34:27.870 --> 34:31.730]  And you, on occasion, want to eat a baked potato
[34:32.370 --> 34:35.790]  or maybe you want to eat a plate of French fries with some poutine on them
[34:35.790 --> 34:37.890]  or mashed potatoes or whatever.
[34:37.930 --> 34:39.510]  But you have a potato desire.
[34:39.750 --> 34:41.410]  It's bubbling up inside of you.
[34:41.510 --> 34:43.230]  You recognize it. You acknowledge it.
[34:43.310 --> 34:44.890]  And now you want to do something about it.
[34:44.890 --> 34:48.930]  You want to convey to everyone in the vicinity of Andrew
[34:48.930 --> 34:50.710]  that you're feeling potatoey.
[34:51.470 --> 34:54.450]  I present to you the potato flag.
[34:54.890 --> 34:58.050]  Imagine a potato flag, a little flag that sits on your desk.
[34:58.370 --> 35:02.810]  And whenever you want to eat a potato of any kind, you raise the flag.
[35:03.070 --> 35:04.730]  You raise your potato flag.
[35:05.130 --> 35:06.870]  Here's the problem. And I love the idea.
[35:07.310 --> 35:09.250]  The issue is the flag's never coming down for me.
[35:09.410 --> 35:10.610]  I'm a big potato guy.
[35:11.010 --> 35:12.290]  Give me a potato every day.
[35:12.290 --> 35:15.490]  Then you you fly that flag and you fly it proudly.
[35:15.930 --> 35:18.750]  I'm flying that flag every single day.
[35:18.990 --> 35:19.890]  How's that problem?
[35:20.250 --> 35:21.190]  I guess I don't know.
[35:21.250 --> 35:24.510]  Sometimes people dying, they want you to fly the flag at half mast.
[35:24.590 --> 35:26.170]  And I just couldn't do it with the potato flag.
[35:26.430 --> 35:28.910]  Well, we talked about half mast potato flags, actually.
[35:28.970 --> 35:30.110]  Did you? We did. Yeah.
[35:30.230 --> 35:32.890]  And also you can hang it upside down if potato is in distress.
[35:33.290 --> 35:38.070]  But there was a there's a there's a Mexican restaurant
[35:38.070 --> 35:40.610]  in the southwest called Poncho's.
[35:41.030 --> 35:42.610]  And it's kind of like Fogo de Chau.
[35:42.690 --> 35:44.130]  When you go to Fogo de Chau, you have the card.
[35:44.230 --> 35:46.670]  You flip over red or green when you want them to throw meat at you.
[35:47.270 --> 35:50.310]  At Poncho's, if you want more food, you raise the flag
[35:50.310 --> 35:52.670]  and then they know to come over and do it, give you more food.
[35:52.790 --> 35:54.250]  And I just think it would be awesome.
[35:54.510 --> 35:56.730]  And I was trying to pitch this to Eric and I think everybody's on board.
[35:56.790 --> 35:59.890]  But maybe, Eric, I think we should sell a potato flag.
[36:00.150 --> 36:02.910]  It does. Like, it doesn't for the audience.
[36:03.470 --> 36:04.190]  But what do you do?
[36:04.270 --> 36:06.310]  You carry it around and then you go to a restaurant.
[36:06.470 --> 36:09.570]  You raise the potato flag if that's how you want to use it.
[36:09.570 --> 36:10.810]  Or you can do it in your own house.
[36:11.590 --> 36:14.510]  Maybe I want to let my wife know we're having potatoes tonight.
[36:14.790 --> 36:15.710]  She comes downstairs.
[36:15.870 --> 36:19.190]  I'm not at home because I'm picking the dog up from the groomer or something.
[36:19.350 --> 36:22.430]  But she sees the potato flag is raised and it's on the counter.
[36:22.570 --> 36:24.690]  And she knows, all right, it's a potato kind of evening.
[36:24.810 --> 36:25.950]  I'm going to prepare myself mentally.
[36:26.290 --> 36:29.570]  Like, have you never bought a packet of like cocktail umbrellas?
[36:30.210 --> 36:31.250]  No, absolutely. I have.
[36:31.330 --> 36:32.490]  I absolutely I have.
[36:33.410 --> 36:35.870]  It's just like little funny little fluff junk, isn't it?
[36:35.910 --> 36:37.250]  Yeah. A little bit of flair on your stuff.
[36:37.250 --> 36:41.350]  But no, but this is like this is to serve a purpose of wanting potato.
[36:41.690 --> 36:43.230]  Yeah. Potato flag.
[36:43.330 --> 36:47.390]  You raise your potato flag and you you you express your intent to the world.
[36:47.830 --> 36:48.750]  I don't.
[36:50.530 --> 36:52.810]  Wait, OK, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[36:52.870 --> 36:55.270]  I want to find this flag that you're talking about.
[36:55.650 --> 37:00.410]  So Poncho's is a restaurant where you OK, so this is it.
[37:00.430 --> 37:03.650]  It's raise the flag and then you get refills.
[37:04.070 --> 37:06.190]  Refills another service. Yeah, that's how that's how they know.
[37:06.190 --> 37:08.370]  OK, imagine if on that flag.
[37:08.450 --> 37:11.090]  Actually, in my head, the flag looks more like the idiot pennant.
[37:11.270 --> 37:11.890]  It's like a pennant.
[37:12.010 --> 37:15.950]  But imagine that flag raised and it just has a picture of a baked potato
[37:15.950 --> 37:18.530]  with arms and legs and a happy face.
[37:18.570 --> 37:20.230]  He's smiling because he knows he just got raised.
[37:23.330 --> 37:25.990]  Yes, I was picturing a different type of flag.
[37:26.050 --> 37:28.990]  I was picturing like a challenge flag in the NFL
[37:29.650 --> 37:33.830]  where like if somebody goes to order a different side,
[37:33.830 --> 37:37.690]  you throw it in the middle of the table and then everyone knows that it's actually
[37:37.690 --> 37:40.630]  you can't have rice, it's potato.
[37:40.990 --> 37:42.490]  That's a different product altogether.
[37:42.490 --> 37:43.750]  And I like that, too.
[37:43.830 --> 37:45.930]  I think maybe we can develop both of these.
[37:46.370 --> 37:49.510]  Oh, I love the idea of being able to veto anything with a flag.
[37:49.670 --> 37:51.450]  Just throw it down in regular conversation.
[37:51.810 --> 37:55.170]  There really should be more uses for challenge flag scenarios.
[37:55.350 --> 37:56.230]  I agree with that.
[37:57.430 --> 38:01.450]  So someone's like, I want mac and cheese and then you just you throw that
[38:01.450 --> 38:02.930]  and then like the waiter blows a whistle.
[38:02.930 --> 38:04.330]  Yeah, I think so.
[38:04.370 --> 38:09.450]  Or maybe maybe a novelty restaurant where the waiter can challenge your order.
[38:09.790 --> 38:11.290]  You have to change it.
[38:11.610 --> 38:15.490]  Like like in the group text in Vegas when Emily suggested
[38:15.490 --> 38:20.050]  we eat at fucking Benihana and I threw my challenge flag down
[38:20.050 --> 38:21.370]  and said, we're absolutely not.
[38:21.630 --> 38:23.530]  I have one challenge flag and I veto that.
[38:23.950 --> 38:26.830]  All we got in that group text was Emily saying,
[38:26.910 --> 38:29.310]  Geoff said we're not allowed to eat at Benihana.
[38:29.510 --> 38:30.750]  No one suggested anything.
[38:30.890 --> 38:31.790]  Nobody did anything.
[38:31.790 --> 38:33.810]  It was just that crazy.
[38:35.030 --> 38:36.090]  I don't want to eat there.
[38:36.410 --> 38:40.090]  The other thing I noticed is the way Nick's wife tackled the baked potato.
[38:40.390 --> 38:42.170]  She kind of like flayed it.
[38:42.210 --> 38:45.510]  Like when when Ash is dissecting the facehugger in Alien,
[38:45.810 --> 38:47.390]  it's all kind of spread out flat.
[38:47.850 --> 38:49.930]  Yeah, it was an amazing approach to a baked potato.
[38:50.310 --> 38:51.130]  Well, wait, how do you do it?
[38:51.370 --> 38:52.630]  Oh, it's the best way to get the spread.
[38:52.910 --> 38:53.690]  Yeah. What do you do?
[38:53.990 --> 38:57.090]  I guess I just like eat, eat downwards as it is.
[38:57.510 --> 38:57.930]  Yeah. Yeah.
[38:58.230 --> 39:00.830]  I'm just getting some of like the toppings in with each bite.
[39:00.830 --> 39:03.870]  I thought her her way might have opened my eyes.
[39:04.170 --> 39:05.870]  It would open the potato. That's for sure.
[39:05.910 --> 39:09.830]  Oh, wait. So the potato was wide open, split down the middle.
[39:09.830 --> 39:13.210]  And then like it's almost like both sides are elevating it up face up.
[39:13.250 --> 39:16.050]  Like the skin was flat down against the table.
[39:16.490 --> 39:19.690]  It was like it's like an autopsy, like a potato autopsy.
[39:20.410 --> 39:20.690]  Oh,
[39:23.370 --> 39:30.810]  you know, I think I'd like to see it.
[39:30.810 --> 39:33.410]  I'd like to see an image of it fully processed at some point.
[39:33.670 --> 39:36.550]  Can you get a picture of your wife's baked potatoes next time, Nick?
[39:36.710 --> 39:39.790]  Next time there's a big potato scenario, Nick, I'd love to see the technique.
[39:40.230 --> 39:43.170]  Can I bring up another potato thing that we talked about at that dinner?
[39:44.030 --> 39:45.470]  So we ended up getting the baked potato.
[39:45.810 --> 39:50.150]  Amanda got hers and then we got one for the table, which is good.
[39:50.650 --> 39:52.090]  There was we also got mashed potatoes.
[39:55.190 --> 39:58.970]  Oh, can you ask your question to Andrew, please?
[39:58.970 --> 40:02.330]  Geoff, that's pretty good.
[40:02.630 --> 40:03.410]  That's pretty good.
[40:03.610 --> 40:05.930]  He photoshopped potato on the end of the challenge flag.
[40:06.010 --> 40:07.390]  It's pretty good. It's pretty good.
[40:07.710 --> 40:09.590]  Potato flag and the potato challenge.
[40:09.710 --> 40:10.570]  I think it was amazing.
[40:11.090 --> 40:13.610]  I don't know that this was my question, Eric.
[40:13.690 --> 40:14.830]  I think this is Gavin's question.
[40:15.010 --> 40:16.270]  Oh, this is Gavin. OK.
[40:16.690 --> 40:18.010]  If you get mashed potato
[40:19.150 --> 40:21.490]  and you dyed it blue, right?
[40:21.570 --> 40:23.730]  Bit of food dye in there. Mix it up. It's blue mash.
[40:24.150 --> 40:26.510]  And then you did the same with another bowl of potato.
[40:26.850 --> 40:27.410]  Dye it yellow.
[40:27.970 --> 40:30.850]  If you mix both mashed potatoes together,
[40:30.850 --> 40:34.790]  do you get like a marbled blue and yellow mash or do you get green mash?
[40:36.850 --> 40:38.730]  Now, I was never good at the color mixing.
[40:39.610 --> 40:40.750]  Well, those are the right colors.
[40:40.810 --> 40:41.850]  Let me let me tell you right now.
[40:41.910 --> 40:42.810]  Those are the right colors.
[40:43.490 --> 40:45.410]  Yeah, I just...
[40:48.050 --> 40:49.550]  I'm really thinking about it.
[40:49.590 --> 40:52.410]  And it's a thing where, like, I'm trying to put a lot of thought into it.
[40:52.490 --> 40:55.390]  And it's also a thing where it could be either way.
[40:55.390 --> 40:59.550]  And my reaction is the same of like, OK, I think it mixes.
[40:59.970 --> 41:00.910]  I think it mixes.
[41:01.550 --> 41:04.970]  Well, that puts you in the in the vast majority then.
[41:05.090 --> 41:06.430]  Yeah. Why wouldn't it mix?
[41:06.790 --> 41:08.950]  I'm pretty sure it would mix. Why wouldn't it?
[41:09.250 --> 41:09.710]  Yeah, I don't know.
[41:10.070 --> 41:11.450]  I just don't think it does.
[41:11.930 --> 41:12.810]  I don't think so either.
[41:13.210 --> 41:15.030]  Yeah, I just don't think it's going to work.
[41:15.130 --> 41:18.490]  I would say the person who is most confident it would mix was Eric's small wife.
[41:18.770 --> 41:23.210]  Yes, but I think she talked to me about it later because she was upset about it.
[41:24.030 --> 41:24.910]  Yeah, she was.
[41:28.570 --> 41:29.590]  She's just like, why?
[41:29.870 --> 41:31.630]  What do you mean marbled? Why would they marble?
[41:31.790 --> 41:33.410]  They would just mix. Why would they marble?
[41:34.150 --> 41:35.110]  And I agree with her.
[41:35.330 --> 41:36.310]  Why would they marble?
[41:36.570 --> 41:39.910]  Well, I just didn't know whether the dye would like take fully to the potato
[41:39.910 --> 41:42.770]  and then be unavailable in liquid form to mix.
[41:43.450 --> 41:44.390]  It's already set.
[41:45.510 --> 41:47.510]  Here's my note I left to myself to talk about.
[41:47.750 --> 41:49.210]  Can you mix colors with potatoes?
[41:49.450 --> 41:51.870]  Let's raise that tater flag and find out.
[41:54.990 --> 41:56.810]  So this is what it turned into.
[41:56.930 --> 42:01.250]  The conversation evolved and we decided that it's something that we have to test out now.
[42:01.330 --> 42:05.130]  So we're going to film a supplemental where we dye mashed potatoes.
[42:05.670 --> 42:10.450]  But then we decided, yes, if the colors do match, we need an expert.
[42:10.790 --> 42:12.790]  That's what we need. We need a color mixing expert.
[42:13.030 --> 42:16.250]  And we only know one color mixing expert.
[42:16.590 --> 42:19.230]  And that is our friend, Batdog, the professional painter.
[42:19.230 --> 42:24.710]  So I hit up Birdog and I asked him and he jumped at the opportunity
[42:24.710 --> 42:28.650]  and he expanded it to not only our, which, by the way,
[42:28.650 --> 42:33.890]  he says the science checks out and that the potato colors will they will mix.
[42:34.210 --> 42:35.970]  So he's definitely in the in the majority.
[42:36.330 --> 42:39.810]  But what he wants to do is come over one day when we do the test
[42:39.810 --> 42:42.350]  and be a part of it, and then he'll take all the mixed colors
[42:42.350 --> 42:43.770]  and he'll paint something with it.
[42:43.970 --> 42:46.370]  So he's going to he was saying that he could recreate a Rembrandt
[42:46.370 --> 42:47.270]  with mashed potatoes.
[42:48.290 --> 42:50.350]  Oh, originally you were calling it the patainting,
[42:50.450 --> 42:52.450]  but then you didn't like that taint was in it.
[42:53.210 --> 42:55.350]  Then it became the pain-tato. Is that right?
[42:55.430 --> 42:58.290]  Yeah. Yeah. The pain-tato, I think, is better than patainting.
[42:58.850 --> 43:00.150]  I really like patainting.
[43:02.530 --> 43:04.430]  Well, Nick brought out that you're saying taint.
[43:05.110 --> 43:06.270]  Well, the other one, you're saying pain.
[43:06.770 --> 43:08.350]  I'm OK with pain. You get a point. OK.
[43:08.830 --> 43:10.610]  You know, pain is the point. All right.
[43:11.330 --> 43:14.170]  Pain is the point. But I didn't.
[43:14.170 --> 43:16.210]  That's that's that's old Milfeet over there talking.
[43:18.910 --> 43:22.330]  I so anyway, look for that in the in the near to medium future.
[43:22.410 --> 43:24.110]  We're going to get Burndog over whenever he's free
[43:24.110 --> 43:25.030]  and then we're going to mix up.
[43:25.210 --> 43:27.170]  Well, I'll make a bunch of mashed potatoes
[43:27.690 --> 43:28.730]  and then we're going to mix it up.
[43:28.790 --> 43:30.770]  Maybe I'll do it since I'll be in the kitchen cooking.
[43:31.170 --> 43:34.850]  Maybe we can also do a competition that that fell into our laps
[43:34.850 --> 43:38.810]  between Nick and Gavin, where they're going to see
[43:38.810 --> 43:41.870]  who can eat the most deviled eggs. Oh, yeah.
[43:44.850 --> 43:46.810]  How many ways are there to make an egg?
[43:47.430 --> 43:48.270]  Oh, that's right.
[43:48.370 --> 43:50.570]  That was the conversation is how many ways are there?
[43:50.670 --> 43:52.170]  Gavin, how many ways are there to make an egg?
[43:52.490 --> 43:56.130]  Well, as I said, as I was taught as a kid, there are four different ways to make it.
[43:56.330 --> 43:58.970]  But I've come to realize there are way more than four.
[44:00.530 --> 44:01.650]  I was always taught.
[44:02.430 --> 44:03.590]  And it was always in an order.
[44:03.730 --> 44:06.310]  I was always taught that it was like number one was that was
[44:07.590 --> 44:09.690]  scrambled. Number two was fried.
[44:10.230 --> 44:11.850]  Number three was boiled.
[44:11.850 --> 44:13.510]  And number four was poached.
[44:14.450 --> 44:16.990]  We were... I was trying to get something weird out of Gavin.
[44:17.170 --> 44:19.830]  And I was like, I just kept asking normal questions
[44:19.830 --> 44:21.210]  and just trying to get deeper and deeper.
[44:21.390 --> 44:23.150]  I was just trying to find something goofy.
[44:23.470 --> 44:26.890]  And then out of the blue, he goes, well, yeah, I mean, that's what my mom taught me.
[44:26.910 --> 44:28.090]  Right. There's only four ways to make an egg.
[44:28.110 --> 44:30.510]  When I was a little lad and I was like, there it is.
[44:30.810 --> 44:33.530]  There it is. Go on.
[44:35.070 --> 44:38.370]  I should start giving more like just one word answers to your questions.
[44:40.250 --> 44:44.630]  It took me a while of peeling back layers till I got to that.
[44:45.730 --> 44:49.950]  But anyway, so, yeah, you and Nick, I think you can out eat each other
[44:49.950 --> 44:52.230]  in a deviled eggs.
[44:52.470 --> 44:55.550]  And I think, unfortunately, the only way to truly eat a deviled egg
[44:55.550 --> 44:58.590]  is to eat it at a restaurant, which would be way too expensive and hard to get
[44:58.990 --> 45:02.610]  or to have it homemade because a deviled egg from a store like the grocery store
[45:02.610 --> 45:05.830]  sucks. So I and I also have made deviled eggs in the past
[45:05.830 --> 45:07.470]  and I absolutely hate doing it.
[45:07.470 --> 45:09.630]  So I figure I'll be the one to make it.
[45:09.790 --> 45:13.490]  So make the, you know, 50 deviled eggs or whatever.
[45:13.690 --> 45:16.650]  And then we can, I don't know, make a potato while we're at it.
[45:20.090 --> 45:21.930]  I've just been held up
[45:21.930 --> 45:25.790]  this entire time on when this conversation was first brought up.
[45:26.250 --> 45:28.530]  Eric said something about ordering a baked potato for the table
[45:28.530 --> 45:30.630]  and taking that very literally.
[45:31.010 --> 45:33.470]  What an insane power move.
[45:33.550 --> 45:34.690]  Just psycho move.
[45:34.830 --> 45:36.170]  If you're at a group dinner
[45:36.170 --> 45:39.130]  and as soon as everyone sits down, you're like, yeah, I'm going to work.
[45:39.430 --> 45:41.590]  Can we just get one baked potato for the table, please?
[45:42.090 --> 45:46.050]  Just one. Just like immediately order a singular baked potato.
[45:46.250 --> 45:49.110]  That's a really good premise of it's for the table.
[45:49.370 --> 45:50.030]  Yeah, I like that.
[45:50.670 --> 45:51.810]  Who touches it?
[45:51.970 --> 45:54.610]  Like one baked potato, six, six forks, please.
[45:56.270 --> 45:59.410]  When we went to dinner on the last night, we ordered appetizers
[45:59.410 --> 46:01.830]  and then ate them all and they were very good.
[46:01.850 --> 46:05.170]  And then Geoff thought that that was the whole meal.
[46:05.610 --> 46:08.130]  I didn't realize that we had ordered like mains.
[46:08.550 --> 46:12.650]  I went to the bathroom when you guys ordered and spaghetti came out
[46:12.650 --> 46:13.490]  or pasta came out.
[46:13.550 --> 46:16.190]  And so I ate a bunch of pasta and I was like and salad.
[46:16.330 --> 46:17.950]  And I was like, wow, that's a meal, salad and pasta.
[46:18.270 --> 46:20.430]  And I remember thinking like somebody had mentioned,
[46:20.530 --> 46:22.550]  there's no way we're going to be able to get through all this food.
[46:23.170 --> 46:25.810]  And then I looked at the table and we had eaten the chicken parm
[46:25.810 --> 46:27.950]  and we'd eaten the pasta and we'd eaten all the salad.
[46:28.030 --> 46:29.970]  And I thought, wow, we did a really good job.
[46:30.290 --> 46:30.610]  Congratulations.
[46:31.150 --> 46:32.190]  We didn't waste anything.
[46:32.270 --> 46:33.890]  And then there were 700 more plates.
[46:34.330 --> 46:35.130]  That's crazy.
[46:35.290 --> 46:36.770]  I don't blame you for thinking.
[46:37.090 --> 46:38.430]  He just he's like, we ate the salad.
[46:38.550 --> 46:39.110]  We're done here.
[46:39.470 --> 46:39.750]  Like what?
[46:40.190 --> 46:42.670]  And the chicken parm I had and the spaghetti.
[46:43.150 --> 46:46.330]  I just didn't realize they would like they kept replenishing chicken parm.
[46:46.490 --> 46:49.490]  Like when we would finish the chicken parm, they'd just bring more chicken parm.
[46:49.890 --> 46:51.690]  This sounds like the best place ever.
[46:51.770 --> 46:53.250]  There's like no, there's like a mushroom.
[46:53.350 --> 46:57.110]  Somebody ordered like a mushroom parm thing for the appetizer.
[46:57.150 --> 46:58.430]  And then we also ordered chicken parm.
[46:58.870 --> 47:01.010]  Right. It looked like chicken parm, but it wasn't.
[47:01.070 --> 47:02.550]  Was that mushroom parm I ate?
[47:02.550 --> 47:02.770]  Yeah.
[47:04.490 --> 47:06.530]  What? Are you fucking kidding me?
[47:06.530 --> 47:08.870]  Did I not notice that was mushroom and not chicken?
[47:09.310 --> 47:10.490]  Emma ordered it, didn't she?
[47:11.130 --> 47:12.930]  Yeah. I just ate chicken parm.
[47:12.970 --> 47:14.110]  I didn't realize that wasn't chicken.
[47:17.170 --> 47:20.890]  I didn't have any chicken parm because I was full off the mushroom parm.
[47:23.360 --> 47:24.640]  I didn't even realize.
[47:25.680 --> 47:27.760]  Man, you can't tell the difference between mushrooms and chicken.
[47:28.480 --> 47:30.000]  I'm dude, I'm like stunned.
[47:30.360 --> 47:31.680]  I'm like stunned right now.
[47:31.820 --> 47:32.500]  I just don't know.
[47:32.900 --> 47:33.900]  I just don't know, man.
[47:33.900 --> 47:36.420]  Just live your life not knowing you had a mushroom.
[47:37.440 --> 47:39.000]  I mean, I like mushrooms, right?
[47:39.060 --> 47:39.940]  I guess I didn't think about it.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.340]  It was all I mean, it's mostly sauce and cheese, right?
[47:42.640 --> 47:45.000]  You're just the mushroom or the chicken is just the thing
[47:45.000 --> 47:46.620]  you got to chew to get through the sauce and cheese.
[47:47.200 --> 47:48.500]  I fucking listen.
[47:48.860 --> 47:50.740]  Let me throw this out there to the to the audience.
[47:51.200 --> 47:54.040]  If you can get a mushroom parm for cheaper than a chicken parm,
[47:54.260 --> 47:55.320]  you won't tell the difference.
[47:56.920 --> 47:59.180]  Yeah, I mean, I thought I thought it was fine.
[47:59.420 --> 48:00.240]  I thought it was pretty good.
[48:00.880 --> 48:01.560]  What a trip.
[48:02.780 --> 48:05.580]  Yeah, eating mushrooms, not even knowing about it.
[48:05.660 --> 48:06.940]  Going to weird outlines.
[48:07.360 --> 48:08.720]  Yeah, it was magic.
[48:09.180 --> 48:09.880]  It was a lot of fun.
[48:10.080 --> 48:11.000]  Got a let's play video.
[48:11.180 --> 48:13.060]  We'll cut from the pinball museum.
[48:13.460 --> 48:17.160]  Yeah. Got a couple of supplementals that we'll record.
[48:17.240 --> 48:21.700]  We also came up with another another idea for daily,
[48:21.940 --> 48:25.540]  like a month of daily content that I don't know if we want to dive into here.
[48:25.600 --> 48:27.060]  Maybe maybe talk about behind the scenes.
[48:27.220 --> 48:30.380]  And I mean, I think we can talk about it.
[48:30.380 --> 48:33.340]  I think if I think if there's like half an idea, maybe we can round it into something
[48:33.340 --> 48:34.500]  that's like a little bit further along.
[48:34.700 --> 48:36.980]  OK, whose idea?
[48:37.120 --> 48:39.560]  Well, I genuinely don't remember whose idea this was, but I know it wasn't mine.
[48:39.900 --> 48:41.660]  I just assume it was Gavin, but I don't know.
[48:42.180 --> 48:46.800]  Hey, oh, OK, well, then you would follow up the hey-o with diving in.
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.360]  We were going to see how many days
[48:50.220 --> 48:55.480]  it would take to flip a coin and get heads five times in a row.
[48:55.520 --> 48:59.000]  So every morning flip five coins or I guess if you flip heads
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.740]  and then you flip tails, stop there.
[49:00.980 --> 49:04.560]  But the goal is to flip heads five times in a row.
[49:04.620 --> 49:05.660]  Yeah, definitely.
[49:05.660 --> 49:09.240]  Like something where it's probably definitely more suited for like social.
[49:09.420 --> 49:13.040]  I mean, you put it on Patreon and stuff, but like put it on TikTok, put it on TikTok.
[49:13.340 --> 49:16.600]  It definitely feels like trying to flip a coin five times to get heads.
[49:16.800 --> 49:22.320]  I follow a guy who's trying who's been trying to roll Yahtzee every day for 385 days.
[49:23.380 --> 49:24.720]  He has not done it.
[49:24.840 --> 49:25.840]  He is getting desperate.
[49:26.120 --> 49:27.320]  He is getting weird.
[49:27.460 --> 49:28.620]  It's getting weirder.
[49:28.620 --> 49:29.940]  It's really fantastic.
[49:31.400 --> 49:32.560]  So I don't know.
[49:32.900 --> 49:35.680]  It's I like the idea of flipping a coin five times.
[49:35.820 --> 49:37.380]  It's Geoff Sox, right? It's fun.
[49:37.700 --> 49:40.540]  I similarly watch the guy who would go to Best Buy every day
[49:40.540 --> 49:44.680]  and he would online gamble on a smart fridge until he made enough money to buy
[49:44.680 --> 49:46.520]  the fridge. Dude, did you? Oh, I love it.
[49:46.640 --> 49:51.060]  Those two guys gambling on a refrigerator to win the money for the refrigerator
[49:51.060 --> 49:52.200]  is fucking awesome.
[49:52.580 --> 49:54.260]  It has to be fake. I don't care.
[49:54.480 --> 49:55.020]  I love it.
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.580]  They eventually got the money and then the fridge was out of stock
[49:57.580 --> 50:00.760]  so they couldn't buy it from a different store.
[50:00.940 --> 50:02.020]  Yeah, tragic.
[50:02.140 --> 50:04.880]  The five times coin thing, though, is I feel like quite doable
[50:04.880 --> 50:08.780]  because it's only yeah, it's not a super high number of was it like one in 120
[50:08.780 --> 50:09.160]  or something?
[50:09.380 --> 50:10.740]  It could be any of the five of us.
[50:10.780 --> 50:12.000]  It doesn't have to be Gavin every day.
[50:12.060 --> 50:13.880]  Like we can rotate it out if he's out of town or whatever.
[50:14.160 --> 50:15.080]  Hey, hey, hey.
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.760]  Doesn't even have to be the five of us.
[50:17.120 --> 50:18.260]  You want to hire a flipper?
[50:18.620 --> 50:21.740]  No, we could get what the fuck we get.
[50:22.160 --> 50:25.240]  I want Ray to flip a coin five times.
[50:25.560 --> 50:26.920]  Oh, OK. Yeah, we get rid of that.
[50:26.920 --> 50:30.420]  We should just farm out and maybe send people our regulation coins.
[50:30.700 --> 50:32.360]  You know, other people can help us.
[50:32.640 --> 50:34.460]  Oh, we should get regulation coins.
[50:34.500 --> 50:37.420]  Right. We should get because we need something to flip.
[50:37.480 --> 50:40.420]  Not because, you know, what are we going to flip an American quarter?
[50:40.740 --> 50:43.360]  That doesn't do anybody in Europe any good.
[50:43.500 --> 50:44.440]  It doesn't speak to Europe.
[50:44.520 --> 50:47.740]  It should be an Ian on the head side and a butthole on the tail side.
[50:47.840 --> 50:48.940]  Ian, Ian's an asshole.
[50:49.140 --> 50:49.800]  What's a butthole?
[50:50.140 --> 50:51.780]  Oh, Ian's an asshole. Oh, like the show logo?
[50:52.000 --> 50:52.820]  Oh, like the show logo.
[50:53.220 --> 50:55.320]  All right. Hang on. I'm writing it down. Hang on.
[50:55.320 --> 50:57.160]  So the face on one side and the butt on the other.
[50:57.460 --> 50:59.260]  OK. Yeah, I like it.
[50:59.580 --> 51:02.940]  Who? OK, so if we're all doing it, say it's like an individual thing
[51:02.940 --> 51:05.540]  and we're filming like the coin being flipped or whatever.
[51:06.060 --> 51:07.620]  Say, say that Nick gets it.
[51:07.720 --> 51:10.540]  Say that it's day 410, whatever.
[51:11.040 --> 51:13.180]  But Nick does it. He's flipped five.
[51:13.780 --> 51:14.780]  What's the point?
[51:14.880 --> 51:17.080]  Just to see who can do it or is there like a thing?
[51:17.380 --> 51:18.400]  He gets to get out of Greg.
[51:20.600 --> 51:21.400]  Oh, OK.
[51:21.720 --> 51:25.060]  And that's the incentive to put your time in with the quarter.
[51:25.320 --> 51:25.920]  Or with the Ian.
[51:26.680 --> 51:27.600]  Yeah. To get the...
[51:27.600 --> 51:30.700]  Oh, OK. Oh, I like this.
[51:30.700 --> 51:32.040]  I'm writing this down.
[51:32.380 --> 51:35.020]  All of a sudden, Andrew's like real into it now.
[51:35.160 --> 51:36.980]  I hate that Andrew wants to flip this button.
[51:36.980 --> 51:38.880]  I want a second get out of Greg.
[51:40.780 --> 51:43.600]  Andrew with two get out of Greg's is dangerous
[51:43.600 --> 51:46.860]  because he'll be afraid to get out of it knowing he still has one.
[51:47.100 --> 51:50.380]  He's going to use that first one like it's nothing.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.380]  He's going to invent something to use it on. Yeah.
[51:55.320 --> 51:59.480]  What if? Because I don't know how to get out of Greg helps guessed flippers.
[52:00.020 --> 52:04.200]  What if the prize was that one of the coins is 24 karat gold?
[52:06.480 --> 52:08.900]  What? What the fuck are you talking about?
[52:08.940 --> 52:10.100]  That's a terrible idea.
[52:10.340 --> 52:12.340]  Yeah. They'll be gold looking coins, right?
[52:12.340 --> 52:13.240]  But one of them will be real.
[52:14.500 --> 52:15.860]  No. What?
[52:16.000 --> 52:19.280]  How much does a 24 karat gold coin cost?
[52:19.380 --> 52:21.740]  That seems incredibly expensive and unnecessary.
[52:22.280 --> 52:24.560]  I wanted to be like a really cool prize.
[52:24.920 --> 52:27.940]  I don't think they would think that was a really cool prize.
[52:28.360 --> 52:29.660]  You wouldn't want a gold coin.
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.300]  Here's what I would. Oh, not a regulation.
[52:32.500 --> 52:33.660]  Fake gold coin. No.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.300]  Well, you can melt it to whatever you want. It's gold.
[52:36.460 --> 52:37.280]  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[52:37.340 --> 52:38.940]  I'm melting stuff all the time.
[52:39.200 --> 52:40.260]  Whatever you want.
[52:40.660 --> 52:44.120]  Yeah. If you sell gold to someone, they don't care what shape it's in.
[52:44.220 --> 52:46.780]  The only thing I've melted, Gavin, is a dinner roll.
[52:46.880 --> 52:48.520]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[52:50.620 --> 52:52.160]  Hmm. Oh, man. All right.
[52:52.160 --> 52:52.680]  We'll keep going.
[52:52.680 --> 52:54.960]  It might. No, no, no.
[52:54.980 --> 52:56.480]  Hold on. I think you're on to something here.
[52:57.060 --> 53:00.100]  It might we might be able to get one made for a couple hundred
[53:00.100 --> 53:02.280]  to maybe a thousand or so dollars.
[53:02.720 --> 53:04.700]  No, that's way too much. That's insane.
[53:04.820 --> 53:06.240]  I'm with Andrew. That's nuts.
[53:06.500 --> 53:07.720]  But what if we. All right.
[53:07.760 --> 53:09.700]  Well, listen and feel free to say no.
[53:09.820 --> 53:10.880]  You can you can outvote me here.
[53:10.920 --> 53:13.120]  But but what if following along Gavin's idea?
[53:13.160 --> 53:15.360]  I don't like the idea of any of us getting this gold coin.
[53:15.440 --> 53:16.340]  That doesn't make sense to me.
[53:16.620 --> 53:18.460]  No, that's why we get the Greg and they get the gold.
[53:18.960 --> 53:20.140]  Yeah, we. Yeah.
[53:20.400 --> 53:21.700]  Or who's they?
[53:21.700 --> 53:23.140]  The person. The other person flips it.
[53:23.200 --> 53:24.180]  I guess. No, I guess. Flip.
[53:24.400 --> 53:26.740]  Maybe a maybe a Falcon could have a flip.
[53:27.100 --> 53:28.180]  And here's how you do it.
[53:28.320 --> 53:32.820]  If we if we manufacture these coins kind of like like, do you remember a long time
[53:32.820 --> 53:37.320]  ago when Bernie got a bunch of like bronze coins, big bronze coins made
[53:37.320 --> 53:38.440]  and his face was on it?
[53:38.540 --> 53:40.180]  Oh, like those challenge coins or whatever.
[53:40.420 --> 53:41.060]  Yeah. Challenge coins.
[53:41.100 --> 53:43.560]  And then when he would meet somebody and go, hey, Bernie, it's nice to meet you.
[53:43.580 --> 53:45.320]  He'd go, it sure is. Here's my face.
[53:45.520 --> 53:46.460]  You can have that forever.
[53:46.600 --> 53:47.880]  And then you'd be like, oh, cool.
[53:47.900 --> 53:49.640]  I have Bernie's face forever now on this heavy coin.
[53:49.660 --> 53:51.040]  Like essentially make that.
[53:51.040 --> 53:52.820]  And we sell those to the audience.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.480]  But one of them in the 5000 we make or 1000 is the twenty four thousand
[53:58.480 --> 54:00.320]  twenty four karat gold coin.
[54:00.420 --> 54:01.560]  So it goes to the audience.
[54:02.140 --> 54:05.340]  I'm sure there's no way that's legal because I assume it's gambling.
[54:05.640 --> 54:09.140]  I also think whoever wins that is going to wreck their tax return for that.
[54:09.300 --> 54:10.720]  Is that gambling?
[54:11.200 --> 54:12.520]  It's absolutely gambling.
[54:12.860 --> 54:13.840]  No, it's like a parallel.
[54:14.180 --> 54:15.220]  It's just the gold parallel.
[54:15.560 --> 54:16.920]  That's gambling, Geoff.
[54:18.100 --> 54:19.360]  Baseball cards are gambling.
[54:19.360 --> 54:22.120]  Yes. Oh, mechanically.
[54:24.880 --> 54:26.900]  Shut up. Cut that out.
[54:28.340 --> 54:29.500]  Marked it. I'm saying.
[54:30.660 --> 54:32.600]  No, stop saying it.
[54:32.640 --> 54:35.880]  Because there's a difference between a cup that's like there's
[54:35.880 --> 54:41.240]  there's personal value to items and there's actual value to items.
[54:41.560 --> 54:45.480]  And there's a difference between gold and a golden gerbler.
[54:45.860 --> 54:46.900]  I'm sorry, audience.
[54:46.920 --> 54:48.340]  I tried to get you guys a gold coin.
[54:48.340 --> 54:52.540]  Clearly, I have been downvoted by the misers in the group
[54:52.540 --> 54:55.720]  who don't want you to have this wonderful piece of merchandise.
[54:55.860 --> 54:57.620]  But I get it. I get it. I'll back off.
[54:57.720 --> 55:00.380]  Why don't we bring it to the regulation lawyer and see how we can do it?
[55:00.660 --> 55:03.760]  I just feel like this is a lot of work for a thing that you actually aren't
[55:03.760 --> 55:04.740]  that passionate about.
[55:05.300 --> 55:08.620]  We're about to flip a coin for one hundred and forty four days in a row.
[55:08.760 --> 55:11.480]  The coin. We're all on board with flipping the coin.
[55:11.660 --> 55:15.280]  It's this Gavin just introduced a gold coin for guests.
[55:15.280 --> 55:16.920]  I was trying to think of a prize
[55:16.920 --> 55:20.360]  for people who don't see any use in a get out of Greg card.
[55:20.520 --> 55:24.260]  You want to give Jack a gold coin like that's what you're suggesting.
[55:24.540 --> 55:26.940]  He doesn't deserve it, but the audience does.
[55:31.210 --> 55:32.930]  So bizarre. Then what does?
[55:33.170 --> 55:37.590]  OK, but your solution, Geoff, doesn't solve Gavin's problem
[55:37.590 --> 55:38.630]  that he's trying to solve.
[55:38.990 --> 55:40.210]  You're just creating two.
[55:40.530 --> 55:44.330]  You're you are trying to solve what prize the guest should get.
[55:44.330 --> 55:49.950]  And Geoff's response is let's give it to the audience, which is great.
[55:50.090 --> 55:51.050]  I love that.
[55:51.150 --> 55:54.690]  But that goes against the whole point of making the coin
[55:54.690 --> 55:56.650]  in the first place as it was pitched.
[55:56.850 --> 55:57.930]  We'll buy him a lunch.
[55:58.450 --> 56:00.430]  Jack loves lunch. Lunch coin.
[56:02.250 --> 56:03.930]  I'm on board for lunch coin.
[56:04.650 --> 56:06.950]  Lunch coin. We'll give him a free potato flag.
[56:07.450 --> 56:10.110]  What about a potato coin? Potato of your choice?
[56:10.550 --> 56:13.470]  The chances that a guest flipper is going to be the one to pull it
[56:13.470 --> 56:15.150]  are pretty slim anyway, I would say.
[56:15.570 --> 56:17.610]  I think it's equal across all flippers.
[56:17.930 --> 56:19.410]  I agree. Yeah.
[56:19.550 --> 56:22.770]  Well, if it's mainly us flipping and rarely a guest, then it's not.
[56:23.110 --> 56:24.330]  Yeah. Right.
[56:24.370 --> 56:28.050]  But if they have the same odds as we do, they have the same odds, though.
[56:28.290 --> 56:31.630]  Yeah. But if we're flipping 18 times before it happens and they're flipping once.
[56:31.750 --> 56:33.170]  They could do it on the first one.
[56:33.230 --> 56:34.250]  We could all go.
[56:34.630 --> 56:36.630]  The guest flipper could do it on the first one.
[56:36.730 --> 56:38.110]  We could do it on day one.
[56:38.490 --> 56:39.850]  The odds are the same.
[56:40.030 --> 56:42.530]  I'm not saying the odds are different for two people flipping.
[56:42.530 --> 56:45.650]  I'm saying if if I flip 18 times, this one flips one.
[56:45.770 --> 56:47.030]  I've got a better chance.
[56:47.130 --> 56:52.410]  I get what you're saying, but that's what I'm saying is to have to get to the 18
[56:52.410 --> 56:54.710]  is an absurd way of looking at it.
[56:55.550 --> 56:58.430]  What? Hmm. Fuck off.
[56:59.810 --> 57:01.290]  Oh, crazy.
[57:01.610 --> 57:04.090]  Andrew, unfortunately, I'm with you.
[57:04.410 --> 57:05.310]  Yeah. Move in the mayor.
[57:05.450 --> 57:07.650]  Crazy town with me. Regulation town.
[57:07.770 --> 57:10.550]  It's fucking 7 p.m. right now.
[57:10.550 --> 57:13.370]  We're having a great time in goof town.
[57:15.550 --> 57:19.070]  Either way, I want to flip coins and do this.
[57:19.150 --> 57:20.470]  Do this everyday thing.
[57:20.850 --> 57:24.150]  Andrew, could your official title within the company be mayor of goof town?
[57:25.630 --> 57:28.150]  Uh, well, I'm secretary currently, but I don't.
[57:28.450 --> 57:29.890]  All right. I don't mind flip it off.
[57:30.010 --> 57:30.890]  The mayor of goof town.
[57:31.070 --> 57:32.750]  No, you should be secretary karma.
[57:33.030 --> 57:34.670]  Mayor of goof town. It's pretty good.
[57:35.590 --> 57:36.890]  Yeah, I feel like it.
[57:37.010 --> 57:38.450]  I don't know if I want to do that.
[57:38.550 --> 57:40.470]  I feel like it lessens the mayor title.
[57:40.470 --> 57:41.970]  Well, if it's like a side project.
[57:42.850 --> 57:43.810]  That's the thing.
[57:44.010 --> 57:47.590]  I feel like the mayor feels like a side project when really it should be my main gig.
[57:47.670 --> 57:49.950]  That would hurt your constituents, too, because they'd be really upset.
[57:50.050 --> 57:52.130]  They'd be like, this is what you would be so mad.
[57:52.510 --> 57:53.510]  Yeah, they'd be really upset.
[57:53.910 --> 57:55.110]  They'd be pretty furious with you.
[57:55.270 --> 57:56.190]  It's tough to spin.
[57:56.530 --> 57:58.030]  Yeah, it's a tough. I agree.
[57:58.530 --> 57:59.770]  I definitely that's why we're flipping.
[58:00.250 --> 58:02.990]  While we're throwing ideas out that we had in Vegas,
[58:03.150 --> 58:05.110]  allow me to add one more to the pile.
[58:06.010 --> 58:08.970]  OK, Andrew, you know, one of the frustrating things about being
[58:08.970 --> 58:13.230]  in the regulation universe is how many great ideas that
[58:14.250 --> 58:17.790]  we come up with throughout the years that we don't ever get around to.
[58:18.170 --> 58:20.310]  You know, I think calling them great is strong.
[58:20.330 --> 58:21.490]  But I'm with you now.
[58:21.570 --> 58:23.610]  I think that I think I'm not talking about my ideas.
[58:23.650 --> 58:24.410]  I'm talking about y'all's ideas.
[58:24.430 --> 58:27.890]  Like there's some there's some creative people that work in this company.
[58:28.010 --> 58:30.550]  And I think a lot of ideas come out that are really fantastic.
[58:30.550 --> 58:33.050]  And for whatever reason, they just fall by the wayside.
[58:33.170 --> 58:34.470]  They get forgotten about.
[58:34.530 --> 58:36.710]  We steamroll ahead at the new thing.
[58:36.710 --> 58:39.810]  And the reality is, and I think we would all acknowledge this,
[58:39.910 --> 58:44.890]  we have more ideas to produce than we have time to produce the ideas.
[58:45.190 --> 58:48.350]  And so at the end of the day, stuff's just going to fall by the wayside.
[58:48.450 --> 58:52.870]  That's it's it's it's there's just no way around it, unfortunately.
[58:53.050 --> 58:56.310]  Yeah. However, I landed on an idea when we were in Vegas.
[58:56.330 --> 58:59.090]  I was thinking to myself, what if those ideas went somewhere?
[58:59.490 --> 59:02.510]  What if there was some sort of a container for those ideas?
[59:02.870 --> 59:06.010]  What if there was some sort of place to coalesce those ideas?
[59:06.010 --> 59:10.990]  What if there was a bit barrel?
[59:11.410 --> 59:15.170]  Imagine a fifty five gallon red drum like you see in a video game.
[59:15.250 --> 59:18.490]  You look at it, you know, if you shoot that, it's going to explode.
[59:18.610 --> 59:23.210]  Well, our barrel will explode with ideas because we've written down every idea
[59:23.210 --> 59:25.030]  and put it in the bit barrel.
[59:25.310 --> 59:28.590]  The audience can tell us, hey, dickhead face number sixty two.
[59:28.670 --> 59:29.770]  You said you were going to do this.
[59:29.810 --> 59:30.910]  You're going to cook this. You never did.
[59:31.150 --> 59:33.010]  Thanks for reminding us. We put it in the bit barrel.
[59:33.010 --> 59:37.130]  And then at some point, for some reason throughout the year,
[59:37.170 --> 59:41.110]  there is a mechanism that requires us to pull an idea out of the bit barrel
[59:41.110 --> 59:42.950]  and then do that idea.
[59:43.150 --> 59:44.130]  It could be on the third wheel.
[59:44.390 --> 59:45.810]  Yeah, could be on the third wheel.
[59:46.050 --> 59:47.650]  Here's the thing. I love the idea.
[59:47.890 --> 59:48.870]  I think that's a lot of fun.
[59:49.590 --> 59:53.630]  I think the the hurdle, though, isn't the idea pull necessarily.
[59:54.270 --> 59:55.650]  It's us all being available.
[59:56.210 --> 59:57.030]  That's the thing.
[59:57.370 --> 59:59.410]  We got to lock in on that.
[59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.050]  What? What? Confused by that.
[01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.650]  We're all available to make content.
[01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.250]  You're. Yeah, here we are.
[01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:07.590]  Yeah, it just took three weeks.
[01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:08.950]  And that's not an indictment.
[01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:12.390]  My point is that we haven't done a draft in three weeks because he's gone.
[01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.850]  So I love the bit barrel.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:17.150]  But I think the inhibitor isn't necessarily the idea.
[01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.770]  It's availability.
[01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:19.610]  Well, how about the same for anything?
[01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.790]  It's once you pull it from the bit barrel, it's on the same.
[01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.610]  It's on the schedule, just like the podcast and the weekly game plays,
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:28.790]  whatever, like whatever the idea is, we have to produce it.
[01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.690]  If the I am fully on board.
[01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.930]  If the premise is you pull the thing from the bit barrel, it goes on the schedule
[01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:37.470]  and you have to adjust your life around the bit barrel.
[01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.810]  Then I see nothing wrong.
[01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:41.730]  I'm not that there is anything wrong with the bit barrel.
[01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.910]  I've never seen an idea for a show get pitched.
[01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:46.050]  And then that. Yeah.
[01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.850]  The complication being, oh, but we would all have to be there.
[01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:52.470]  Well, no, the premise we have to do time out.
[01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.530]  Time out, Mr. Mr.
[01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:56.650]  Listen, I'm the mayor.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:58.250]  This is what I'm telling you right now.
[01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:00.710]  This is the point of Geoff's idea.
[01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:05.990]  The entire structure of it is that we have things and then we don't.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:07.650]  We aren't able to make them.
[01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.190]  And it's like, oh, we forgot.
[01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.370]  I'm saying I don't think that the issues, at least in my mind, forgetting
[01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:18.010]  it's being of the availability is, I think, the bigger hurdle for us.
[01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.150]  But the barrel is full of forgotten ideas.
[01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.050]  I think we forget stuff constantly.
[01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.710]  Here's the thing.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:25.670]  Because we record two in a row and then we take two weeks off
[01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:28.630]  and we don't remember what what thread to pull from two weeks ago.
[01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:30.630]  The two weeks off is what I'm focusing on.
[01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:35.470]  Yeah. But also if they are forgotten ideas, then I don't know about them.
[01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:38.990]  So maybe when I see the bit barrel, I'll change my stance.
[01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:44.950]  What? So we have to do the barrel in order for you to understand the bit barrel.
[01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:46.230]  No, I get the bit barrel.
[01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:50.190]  But I'm saying that when I hear the bit barrel, I don't feel like under the premise
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:52.750]  of others content that we haven't made.
[01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:54.990]  It's because we are forgetting to do it.
[01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:58.370]  It's largely, I think, the stuff we make and don't make is based around
[01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:01.390]  availability and when we get to it because of availability.
[01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.510]  But we didn't not do these ideas because we weren't available to do them.
[01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:05.590]  We just forgot to do them.
[01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.930]  But that's the thing.
[01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:09.490]  If it's a forgotten idea, then I don't remember.
[01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:13.530]  So I don't know what my point is.
[01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:15.990]  How can I remember a forgotten idea, Gavin?
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:18.850]  That's what the barrel's for.
[01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:20.870]  And that's what I'm saying.
[01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:22.390]  So when I see the barrel,
[01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.330]  maybe I'll be like, oh, no, totally.
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:27.150]  This is I completely get it.
[01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.690]  So in order for you to understand the bit barrel, we have to do the bit barrel.
[01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:32.090]  And I guess, yeah,
[01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:34.510]  because I get it.
[01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:36.030]  I get the premise of it.
[01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.170]  I think it's great.
[01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:38.110]  Yes, I do.
[01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.010]  You're the one that's not getting it.
[01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:40.850]  I get it.
[01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:47.330]  I really just want to spray paint yellow letters that say bit barrel on a big drum.
[01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.190]  I love it. That's great.
[01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:50.530]  It was just a reason to get me to do that.
[01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:54.070]  You left out all the interesting ways we could get the ideas out of the bit barrel.
[01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:56.030]  The first suggestion was that you would do it
[01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:59.710]  bacon bit nightmare style by just flipping
[01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:03.310]  blasting down at the barrel and all the ideas could fling it into the air
[01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:04.110]  and you have to catch one.
[01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:06.030]  Well, yeah, the idea is definitely an Eric.
[01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:09.270]  Eric modified it, I think, is a really interesting way to which
[01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.670]  even if we don't do it for bit barrel, we definitely need to do it for something,
[01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:13.230]  which is we claw machine it.
[01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:16.650]  Yeah, I mean, what we should do is we should take one of the bits
[01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:18.790]  and encase it in 24 karat gold.
[01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:20.050]  So how could we do that?
[01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:21.490]  We would all have to be there.
[01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:33.450]  I guys, I hate to do this.
[01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.190]  I know we're running long and it's time to wrap up,
[01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:39.110]  but I have to read two emails to you before we.
[01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:40.170]  Oh, my God. Wow.
[01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.470]  This is a long episode. Jesus.
[01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:44.730]  I know. I'm sorry, but I've been sitting on these for a while
[01:03:44.730 --> 01:03:46.990]  and I don't want them to end up in the bit barrel
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.870]  because I'm not good at maintaining that email archive.
[01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:54.270]  Yeah. And and if they go in there, how I it's just a black box for Andrew.
[01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.350]  He'd never think of it again.
[01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.690]  We'll never get together.
[01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.370]  From time to time, you know, I do another podcast.
[01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.490]  It's just my own personal musings called Sol Right.
[01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:04.670]  And I have an email address set up where people can email me.
[01:04:04.850 --> 01:04:06.310]  And they do a lot.
[01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:09.990]  And recently I got two emails that I thought were relevant to
[01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:11.390]  and pertaining to regulation.
[01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:14.930]  So if you would allow me, I'd like to read them to you now.
[01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:17.150]  This first one is from a guy named Z.
[01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:18.470]  He says, Hello, Geoff.
[01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:19.750]  I've been a longtime listener.
[01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:22.190]  Don't know if this will break my streak of becoming a comment leaver.
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.110]  It absolutely does, by the way.
[01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:26.130]  But just listen to the recent episode of the regulation podcast
[01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:30.390]  and how you guys were talking about how if Eric would change his name to Zarek.
[01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.590]  And it made my day due to my first name being Z and my middle name being Eric.
[01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:39.850]  For a short time when I was born, I was Zarek due to the fact
[01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:44.050]  that the nurse didn't understand my father's sense of humor by naming me just Z.
[01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:47.510]  And for the longest time, I didn't know Eric was my middle name.
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.430]  I thought my name was Z-Eric.
[01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:52.850]  So what?
[01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:56.650]  I thought it was funny when Gavin asked Eric if he would change his name to Zarek.
[01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:59.510]  That's great. That's wild.
[01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:05.030]  I thought that was the single most delightful email I've ever seen.
[01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:06.050]  That's crazy. Wow.
[01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.130]  There is a Zarek out there, Eric.
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:09.630]  And you could be the other Zarek.
[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:11.070]  You could be the two Zareks.
[01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:12.510]  Wow, Zareks!
[01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:16.770]  I'm floored. I'm floored. Wow.
[01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.190]  This next email I'll read to you, I don't know what to do with.
[01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:21.950]  I'm just reading it because I think it's insane.
[01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:24.910]  And I don't know if I believe it, but there's something at the end
[01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:26.090]  that kind of makes me believe it.
[01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:27.450]  But here, I'll read this to you. OK.
[01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.350]  It's from a guy named Leland.
[01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.890]  I can't believe I'm losing regulation listener status for this.
[01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.030]  I thought you'd be interested to know that the regulation podcast
[01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:39.690]  is an absolute wrecking ball on Amazon's metrics.
[01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:43.010]  Every product, item or random thing talked about on the pod
[01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:45.850]  ends up being ordered in massive amounts from Amazon.
[01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.770]  I work for an Amazon fulfillment center and every week after listening
[01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:53.190]  to the newest episode, I see a huge influx of whatever you talked about.
[01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:55.310]  Thanks to regulation listeners going crazy.
[01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.470]  I'm tired of all these damn cereals.
[01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.330]  It is absolutely hilarious how your podcast skews Amazon's metrics
[01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:05.530]  and watching Amazon purchase huge amounts of these things,
[01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.810]  thinking they're hot right now, only for it to die off in about a week,
[01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:11.970]  leaving us with a huge amount of inventory that we end up having to put on sale.
[01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:16.290]  This got me thinking, how far could you push it?
[01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.630]  How confused could you make everything?
[01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:20.890]  And I don't want to fuck with anybody's business.
[01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:21.930]  I don't want to do anything to get sued.
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:23.690]  But I thought that that was pretty funny.
[01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:26.390]  He said, love you all, except Nick, which I appreciated.
[01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:29.150]  And then he said, nah, Nick, I love you too, but you got to pay for it.
[01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:30.290]  I don't know what that means, but that's funny.
[01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:32.190]  But then he signed his name.
[01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.750]  And this is why it makes me feel like this is a real email.
[01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:36.410]  And I don't know why, but it does.
[01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:40.350]  He signed his name, Leland, comment leaver, 38 hot dogs.
[01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:42.530]  He put his hot dog count in his signature.
[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.090]  That's great.
[01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:46.130]  All correspondents should have that for now.
[01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:47.630]  And I think I completely agree.
[01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.410]  I think the only way to have a regulation correspondence
[01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:51.610]  is to list your hot dog count.
[01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:54.330]  I might just start putting that in all my emails, just at the bottom.
[01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:57.130]  Gavin Free, eight hot dogs.
[01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:58.930]  Are you up to eight?
[01:06:59.290 --> 01:06:59.930]  I think you're at seven.
[01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:01.190]  All right.
[01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:07.050]  Don't just put your hot dog number to make us think you're cool.
[01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:09.950]  It's my hot dog number seven.
[01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.830]  Hold on. Yeah, I think it is.
[01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:13.130]  Yeah. Dog count.
[01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:14.410]  Ah, shit.
[01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:15.590]  I'm sorry, buddy.
[01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.930]  As we as we sign off here,
[01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:22.530]  want to thank the Las Vegas Aviators one more time for Geoff's first pitch
[01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:26.770]  and say that they have the best idea that I've ever seen at a ballpark
[01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:29.590]  where they have their own hot dog that is their specialty hot dog.
[01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:32.770]  But every time they have an opposing team come in,
[01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:37.470]  they also have an opponent dog that they change every series.
[01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:42.990]  And this one had like tater tots and fry sauce and all like this different stuff.
[01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:44.910]  Bacon bits is so good.
[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:45.790]  Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:46.730]  My first hot dog.
[01:07:47.090 --> 01:07:48.490]  Yeah, it was really, really cool.
[01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:49.490]  So way to go.
[01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:52.770]  Las Vegas Aviators, best idea in the business to have an opponent dog.
[01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:56.250]  Absolutely. Also, they have an opponent hamburger as well.
[01:07:56.290 --> 01:07:58.270]  And I did an interview with RJ.
[01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.550]  If anybody's interested in it, you can listen to it on Saul Wright
[01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:02.010]  in the next two or three weeks.
[01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:03.090]  It'll take me a minute to edit that
[01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:05.090]  because that's more complicated than I'm used to editing.
[01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:10.130]  And that'll do it for another episode of the Regulation Podcast, I guess.
[01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:11.890]  Thanks. Thanks for listening to us.
[01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:13.230]  Sorry, this one ran a little long.
[01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:15.410]  I know. I know you guys hate it when we ramble.
[01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:17.150]  They're going to hate that. Yeah, they're going to be mad.
[01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.350]  But we'll be back next week.
[01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:20.530]  We'll be more succinct.
[01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:24.430]  We'll be full of fun facts and fun non-facts, fiction and nonfiction,
[01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:25.250]  as we like to say.
[01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:28.130]  And hopefully you'll check out our Patreon.
[01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.630]  Andrew, what is that Patreon address off the top of your head?
[01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:31.670]  The Regulation Pod.
[01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:35.570]  Nailed it. Jesus Christ. Fucking nailed it.
[01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:36.210]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:39.990]  We'll see you... How in what world was that nailed?
[01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:41.590]  Are you out of your fucking mind?
[01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.090]  I'm sorry. Do you not understand sarcasm?
[01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:46.470]  Oh. Was that sarcastic?
[01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:48.610]  When I said nailed it? All right.
[01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:49.430]  Thank you very much.
[01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.950]  Moving on.
[01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:56.530]  www.https//
[01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:58.690]  The HTTPS is before the W.
[01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:01.170]  I don't know. I'm just saying stuff.
[01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.630]  You Google the Regulation Pod Patreon and then you find it.
[01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.090]  And Regulatreon.com.
[01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:09.530]  Do you think Andrew Googles Google?
[01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.750]  We'll see you next week.
[01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.370]  Yep. Good guess. I love it.
[01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:14.570]  Bye. Bye now.
