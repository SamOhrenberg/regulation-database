[00:00.000 --> 00:04.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is number 61.
[00:05.180 --> 00:11.020]  My name is Geoff, and with me as always, Andrew, Eric, Nick, and Gavin. Almost forgot that one.
[00:11.400 --> 00:16.100]  Decided to go first names only. I'll be honest with you guys, I may not be 100% here today.
[00:16.220 --> 00:20.700]  I'm going to do my goddamn-dest, but I had a bit of a day yesterday.
[00:21.000 --> 00:21.580]  You had a kerfuffle?
[00:21.880 --> 00:22.700]  You had a kerfuffle?
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.480]  Yesterday was a kerfuffle and a half.
[00:25.480 --> 00:26.060]  Shit.
[00:26.520 --> 00:30.880]  There should be a progress bar to unlock for full kerfuffle.
[00:31.640 --> 00:35.220]  At what point does it just ker and then you move into the fuffle
[00:35.220 --> 00:38.240]  and then it becomes a definitive full kerfuffle?
[00:38.640 --> 00:40.520]  I can tell you when it became a fuffle.
[00:41.160 --> 00:43.140]  Oh, let me explain the fuffle.
[00:43.380 --> 00:48.140]  Yeah, we can get there. So, just to catch you up, I went out of town...
[00:48.880 --> 00:53.280]  What's today? Thursday? I went out of town on Tuesday because I hadn't seen my mother
[00:53.280 --> 00:57.720]  in person in a little bit since Christmas and I wanted to go poker with a stick and
[00:57.720 --> 01:00.840]  make sure she was still alive and stuff. She totally is.
[01:01.940 --> 01:05.580]  But no, she was having some health issues and she wanted to see me, so I flew out.
[01:06.340 --> 01:12.020]  Unfortunately, I could only fly out for about 28 hours because of some stuff we have and then
[01:12.020 --> 01:17.120]  travel and we're trying to cram another couple weeks worth of content in for some more summer
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.020]  travel and there's just a lot going on. And so, I basically jumped on a plane as soon as I could,
[01:22.020 --> 01:27.420]  took Millie as a surprise, and we flew out there, had a lovely day in Alabama with her and my
[01:27.420 --> 01:33.140]  aunt at the farm where they all live now, and got up to leave on Wednesday.
[01:33.760 --> 01:38.880]  And because my mom moved into my aunt's house, she's on the other side of Mobile now,
[01:38.960 --> 01:44.780]  which means I no longer fly into the Mobile Airport, which is a, gotta say, dogshit airport.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.560]  But always empty, which is nice, you know? Like, there's never been a line in history
[01:52.100 --> 01:56.260]  in the Mobile Airport. They also don't have stuff like TSA pre-check because why, who would they
[01:56.260 --> 02:00.240]  need it? Who would need it there, right? Are you serious? No, well, they do the thing where you go
[02:00.240 --> 02:05.280]  through and there's no separate line. You just, if they see the TSA pre-check on your ticket,
[02:05.400 --> 02:10.640]  they give you a laminated card that's a hundred years old that's been folded and crinkled 37
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.680]  times. And then you just hand it to a guy and he goes, all right, you don't have to take your shoes
[02:14.680 --> 02:19.200]  off and that's it. There's no like separate line to go through to get faster or anything. You're
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.060]  in the same line and everything. You just don't take your shoes off when other people do, if you
[02:23.060 --> 02:27.760]  have the blue card in your hand. Anyway, so because she's on the other side, like on the east side of
[02:27.760 --> 02:33.360]  Mobile now, I flew into Pensacola, Florida for the first time because, I don't know, it was a little
[02:33.360 --> 02:40.100]  bit closer and the flights worked out. So I rented a car. I got kind of, I got curbed a little bit
[02:40.100 --> 02:44.980]  renting the car because I had the car for 25 hours, which meant they charged me for a second
[02:44.980 --> 02:49.740]  day, which I was a little annoyed by because that made the car cost like an extra hundred bucks
[02:49.740 --> 02:56.560]  for one fucking hour. But it is what it is. What are you going to do? My flight out is at 3.50
[02:56.560 --> 03:03.160]  PM. So I get to the airport at about 2.30 and it's fucking slammed and Millie doesn't have TSA
[03:03.160 --> 03:09.740]  pre-checked or global entry. So I was a little nervous because I assumed the Pensacola airport
[03:09.740 --> 03:14.460]  would be just as empty as the Mobile airport because they're like sister dog shit cities.
[03:14.820 --> 03:20.140]  But it wasn't. It was fucking packed. A lot of people like to go to Pensacola, apparently,
[03:20.200 --> 03:25.020]  or leave Pensacola, apparently. And so we had some stress getting through it all without TSA
[03:25.020 --> 03:29.220]  pre-check. And then, of course, they have the same system where you just get the fucking laminated
[03:29.220 --> 03:34.740]  card and you don't take your shoes off, whatever. Go through, sit in there waiting. We're about 15
[03:34.740 --> 03:39.900]  minutes before we're about to board. Lightning strikes visibly in front of us looking out the
[03:39.900 --> 03:44.740]  window. And I'm like, oh, fuck, they're not going to let us take off if there's lightning striking.
[03:46.220 --> 03:50.980]  And so they didn't. They didn't let us take off. And I'm looking at my connecting flight.
[03:51.600 --> 03:56.560]  I have about 45 minutes before the connecting flight starts boarding after I land. This is
[03:56.560 --> 04:01.520]  plenty of time in DFW to get from the A terminal to the C terminal. Millie and I only had about
[04:01.520 --> 04:05.140]  15 minutes on the way out and we still made it with like four minutes to spare.
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.220]  So I'm not super concerned. I know we've got some padding there and I know they always try to make
[04:09.220 --> 04:13.040]  up time in the air as well. You know how that goes. And they're usually able to make up 15 or
[04:13.040 --> 04:17.320]  20 minutes. And I'm looking at it and I'm like, this is nothing too concerning. Then I notice
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.740]  that the flight that I'm going to be taking from Dallas to Austin is late as well, coming in from
[04:22.740 --> 04:26.320]  Detroit. And I'm like, even better. It took off 15 minutes late. So we really have some time to
[04:26.320 --> 04:32.700]  play with. And I'm just watching the DFW get shut down for a little while. And so I'm just
[04:32.700 --> 04:36.800]  watching on my phone, trying to figure out if we're going to make this connecting flight, you
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.520]  know. And we're just sitting in Florida and we're sitting in Florida and we're sitting in Florida.
[04:41.600 --> 04:48.840]  And then they board us at about 445, a full hour after we were supposed to take off. And my
[04:50.480 --> 04:55.720]  grace period in DFW has disintegrated. And now we're going to land two minutes before the other
[04:55.720 --> 04:59.780]  flight takes off. And I'm like, we're probably not going to make this flight. So I hop over to
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  see about switching to a later flight. All the later flights are booked for American Airlines
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  for the rest of the night. And I go, well, that sucks. And so I thought, you know what?
[05:09.460 --> 05:14.340]  This is something we Austinites deal with. I'm sure it's affected. Eric, maybe you haven't lived
[05:14.340 --> 05:18.100]  here long enough, but I'm sure it's affected the others of you. Every once in a great while,
[05:18.560 --> 05:24.860]  we have to land at DFW as Austinites, rent a car and drive it one way to Austin to get home.
[05:25.400 --> 05:28.300]  Because every because you don't want to because it's it's here's the thing.
[05:28.380 --> 05:33.800]  It's about three hours and five minutes from DFW to my house, right? There's nothing worse than
[05:33.800 --> 05:38.920]  landing in Dallas at 8pm and not being able to leave until 8am the next morning because all the
[05:38.920 --> 05:43.440]  flights got canceled. And you have 12 hours and you're like, it's a fucking three hour drive. I'm
[05:43.440 --> 05:49.000]  so close to home. So every once in a while you rent a car one way and drive it home. And that's
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.700]  just you just deal with it. Well, and pro tip as well. The last flight from Dallas to Austin is
[05:53.700 --> 05:58.800]  often a fake flight is often a fake flight. It just sometimes just gets canceled. Never goes.
[05:59.240 --> 06:04.440]  Yeah, exactly. And so I'm not hyper concerned because worst case scenario, we're just gonna
[06:04.440 --> 06:09.060]  drive home. But while we're on the we get on the plane, we're sitting on the runway, we sit on the
[06:09.060 --> 06:14.160]  runway for 45 minutes before we take off. As soon as we take off, we have now definitely missed this
[06:14.160 --> 06:19.960]  other flight, I'm thinking, you know. And so there are no other flights for the rest of the day. I
[06:19.960 --> 06:23.480]  look for I think not not a big deal. Like I said, not a big deal. I'll just rent a car once we get
[06:23.480 --> 06:28.600]  in the air, get in the air, turn the air, turn the Internet on. The first thing that happens is I get
[06:28.600 --> 06:32.600]  an alert from American Airlines that says you're you're connecting flight has been canceled.
[06:32.720 --> 06:38.860]  A.K.A. Kevin was saying there are no more flights for you to take today. Please call this number.
[06:39.480 --> 06:45.280]  Our web our app is down right now. Please call this number. No schedule your next flight.
[06:45.600 --> 06:51.860]  And I'm like, I'm in the fucking air over Alabama. How am I going to call American Airlines and
[06:51.860 --> 06:55.980]  change my fucking flight? So I'm like, I'm kind of stuck, but I'm also looking and there's no
[06:55.980 --> 06:59.700]  other flights for the rest of the day. As a matter of fact, I look at all airlines just for the hell
[06:59.700 --> 07:04.040]  of it. The only flight going out is a Southwest flight out of Love Field, which is a different
[07:04.040 --> 07:09.920]  airport a half an hour away from DFW. And I'm not going to land in DFW, get in an Uber, drive to
[07:09.920 --> 07:13.880]  another airport to get in a fucking Southwest flight of all things to fly back to Alabama.
[07:13.920 --> 07:18.660]  Right. So I'm like, we are definitely taking the car. So I load up Hertz and I go to rent a car
[07:18.660 --> 07:23.200]  and they're like, I'm sorry, there's no cars at this airport. And I go, that's weird. So I load
[07:23.200 --> 07:28.020]  up Orbitz or Kayak that has all of the different car rental companies. And they're like, we're
[07:28.020 --> 07:34.520]  sorry, there are no cars in the DFW airport at all. So I have Emily check, no cars at all.
[07:34.840 --> 07:41.060]  So then I go, all right, well, worst case scenario, worst case scenario, we land,
[07:41.200 --> 07:45.220]  I Uber to a different location, like our different Hertz or Enterprise, rent a car
[07:45.220 --> 07:52.080]  off airport, rent one of those cars, take it back. No, no, there's not a car in Dallas for rent within
[07:52.080 --> 07:58.540]  40 miles of the DFW airport. It's the first time in my life I have ever seen that. Emily doesn't
[07:58.540 --> 08:04.060]  believe it. She's incredulous. She looks, it's true. And of course I've got shitty plane internet,
[08:04.220 --> 08:10.220]  right? So everything is hyper slow and it keeps disconnecting. And I have to keep re-initializing
[08:10.220 --> 08:15.100]  the American Airlines website. That makes it work again. And so it's a fucking nightmare. It's like,
[08:15.220 --> 08:20.940]  you know, I don't know, trying to research a term paper on, uh, on a modem from 1989.
[08:21.620 --> 08:28.360]  It's, uh, I'm getting like 11 K throughput. It's fucking brutal. And do that thing where
[08:28.360 --> 08:31.860]  if you want to look at a picture of a woman with her tits out,
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.080]  it just loads line by line and takes forever. And then you like, at some point you're like,
[08:36.140 --> 08:43.120]  that's enough tits. I don't need the lower half. Uh, so I, uh, like I got all the,
[08:43.120 --> 08:50.860]  almost to her belly button. That's good. Uh, so I'm a little nervous now because I'm landing in
[08:50.860 --> 08:58.860]  Dallas at 7 30 PM now. And I, there's no flights out of DFW. I checked that Southwest flight.
[08:59.020 --> 09:03.720]  It's booked now. So that I can't even take that if I want to. Emily's like, there's a bus you can
[09:03.720 --> 09:09.280]  take like a super speed bus that you can take from Dallas to Austin. I'm like, fuck it. We'll
[09:09.280 --> 09:16.240]  take the super speed bus go to go to get, get that can't because it takes off from Dallas Love
[09:16.240 --> 09:22.220]  Field, the other airport that's 30 minutes away. And it takes off sharp at 8 PM. I ended up not
[09:22.220 --> 09:27.780]  landing till like 7 40, I think. And so there's literally impossible for me to get to that one.
[09:27.880 --> 09:33.180]  So then I go, I'm going to, maybe I'll rent like a black car service. Right. Uh, and so I started
[09:33.180 --> 09:37.560]  looking at that. I can't find one for under like a grand. So I go to Emily and I'm like, I've given
[09:37.560 --> 09:43.960]  up. I give up. We're stuck in Dallas for the night. Like, I can't fucking believe I'm three
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.440]  hours away from my front door. And you, my beautiful wife who I miss dearly, because we
[09:48.440 --> 09:54.400]  are so codependent that even 24 hours apart is becoming difficult. Uh, I don't know what to do.
[09:54.400 --> 09:58.280]  And she goes, I'll take care of it. You're not spending the night in Dallas. Text me back. And
[09:58.280 --> 10:03.820]  she goes, a car is going to pick you up at baggage claim. Look for your name. She rented us a car
[10:03.820 --> 10:11.900]  service and a guy at 8 p.m. last night in a black, uh, Chevy Tahoe or a black Suburban drove
[10:11.900 --> 10:18.160]  Millie and I from the airport home. We didn't get home till almost midnight. Oh, that's nuts. Yeah.
[10:18.460 --> 10:23.600]  You got your own speed bus. Absolutely. And I would never have done it because of how much it
[10:23.600 --> 10:28.320]  cost. It was brutal, but I'm so glad she did. Cause I had so, you know, I had threaded that
[10:28.320 --> 10:34.220]  so tightly because we have so much to do over the next couple of days. Like we're recording
[10:34.740 --> 10:40.200]  nine videos, I think, and streams over in Thursday and Friday. So I couldn't miss any of that,
[10:40.300 --> 10:44.340]  obviously, because, you know, people start to go out of town again real soon. And so I was kind of
[10:44.340 --> 10:50.420]  stuck. Like I had to get home. And so I did something I didn't, I didn't think I'd ever do
[10:50.420 --> 10:55.280]  in my life. I took a private car from Dallas to Austin, uh, because my wife booked it for me.
[10:55.280 --> 11:00.620]  Well, even if you flew very early this morning, you probably would have been here in time for
[11:00.620 --> 11:03.300]  stuff, but you'd have been knackered. You'd have to wake up at like four or something.
[11:03.680 --> 11:08.560]  I would have gotten home at like 1015. I probably would have landed at like 945. So I probably got
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.700]  home like 10, 1015. Yeah. And then basically turned on my computer and sat down and got ready
[11:12.700 --> 11:17.140]  to go. And with no, you know, and I didn't have any more changes of clothes or anything. So I
[11:17.140 --> 11:21.160]  don't, it was only at my mom's for a night. So I had been dirty and gross and I'm, I don't do well
[11:21.160 --> 11:26.360]  in those situations. So I would have not have, I'm already not all here today because for some
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.180]  reason, after all that, I slept like dog shit last night. Adrenaline. Something about being
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.720]  overtired makes you unable to sleep. Yeah. It's like your body gives you half of a second wind.
[11:39.320 --> 11:44.600]  Yeah, exactly. And so I'm, I'm not all, uh, I'm not a hundred percent today, but I'm way better
[11:44.600 --> 11:50.680]  than I would be if I'd had to go from a double tree to DFW to home this morning. And, uh, I got
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.580]  to say that's up there with some of the shittiest customer service I've experienced in that fuck.
[11:55.660 --> 12:00.800]  American airlines just was like, no. And then the app just wouldn't load for the rest of the night.
[12:00.880 --> 12:03.640]  They're like, we're having app problems. And it just crashed and crashed. I never heard from
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.800]  American airlines again. Nobody called me. They just sent me one email that said, your flight's
[12:07.800 --> 12:15.200]  been canceled. Call us like, just didn't seem to give much of a shit at all. No attempt to reschedule
[12:15.200 --> 12:19.020]  us by anybody. And it's like, start to, it makes you wonder like, what the fuck am I executive
[12:19.020 --> 12:25.660]  platinum for? You know, you know what that email was? What? It was the fuffle. I was going to say,
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.160]  that's the moment I felt the fuffle is when I was in the air and I got the email
[12:29.160 --> 12:34.400]  telling me that my only course of action was to call them while I was airborne. You know,
[12:34.820 --> 12:39.860]  I have a question. Were all of the other flights canceled or were they just full?
[12:40.940 --> 12:44.780]  Canceled, full, canceled and full. It was a mixture of, uh, of them. I guess there was some
[12:44.780 --> 12:48.380]  weather in Dallas yesterday. They stopped the airport, shut the airport down for a little while
[12:48.380 --> 12:53.420]  and so they just canceled a bunch of flights. Did you try standby on any of those of the
[12:53.420 --> 13:00.380]  remaining ones? Uh, no, I didn't try standby. Um, I didn't think it was, I had Millie with me
[13:00.380 --> 13:05.640]  and I would have done that a couple of years ago when executive platinum used to, used to be a,
[13:05.740 --> 13:10.100]  have a little bit more weight to it, but now it's, it's nothing. And I don't think, I think if
[13:10.100 --> 13:14.600]  I tried to standby, then I would have made it home at two in the morning instead of midnight
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.180]  because I would have taken the car later. I've been having good standby luck recently though,
[13:18.180 --> 13:23.000]  because I often land in Dallas and I know that the last flight is nine times out of 10, just not
[13:23.000 --> 13:28.360]  going to go. So I always standby to an earlier flight. And, uh, so many people miss their flights
[13:28.360 --> 13:32.660]  or miss their connections in Dallas that I almost always get on. Standby for an earlier flight
[13:32.660 --> 13:38.000]  almost always works. Standing by for a later flight never works. That's a, that's a universal
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.120]  thing. I don't know why, but standby for a later flight never works for me. I agree with you
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.860]  that sometimes you get lucky, you land a DFW and you're like, there's a flight going to Austin in
[13:46.860 --> 13:51.980]  nine minutes. I bet I can get to that gate. I feel like 9-11 ruined all travel innovation
[13:51.980 --> 13:59.560]  for fun. Everything's serious. Like I'm trying to, I'm trying to think of alternate methods of,
[13:59.880 --> 14:05.320]  of a world in which travel is unlimited where we, luxury travel becomes actual luxury and not like
[14:05.320 --> 14:12.260]  your perk is you get to keep your shoes on. Uh, that is the perk. That is the perk. Like I feel
[14:12.260 --> 14:19.720]  because of events, it has pivoted innovation into everything has to be taken super seriously at all
[14:19.720 --> 14:25.220]  times. Like what if there is a plane, you know, cause like if you get on a bus, a bus will take
[14:25.220 --> 14:29.980]  you several places, right? Like it's going here to there and you can get off when you want to.
[14:30.400 --> 14:36.420]  If you have a parachute license, you should be able to just jump out of planes as they fly over.
[14:36.480 --> 14:41.640]  Just like dump out at any point. Just dump out. Yeah. Like why? I'm trying to think about like,
[14:41.640 --> 14:47.660]  if you flew over Austin or were within parachuting distance of Austin as a side
[14:47.660 --> 14:52.740]  solution, potentially. That'd be a hefty waiver. I think you'd have to sign. Yeah. You like open,
[14:52.980 --> 14:57.080]  you, you open my eyes to this. I never even considered this. You're totally right. Like
[14:57.080 --> 15:00.880]  the perk is keeping your shoes on when the perk should be parachute. Cause you're close.
[15:01.320 --> 15:05.480]  It should be like, there should be fun stuff that like they're, they're expanding on it. Instead,
[15:05.580 --> 15:10.800]  it's like, Oh, our innovation is we're making standable seats. So more people can be in the
[15:10.800 --> 15:17.720]  plane. That sucks. Let me jump out of the plane. If I'm qualified and I have my license, I'm Oh,
[15:17.800 --> 15:22.960]  where are you headed? I'm on the flight to Hawaii, but really I'm not, I'm, I'm hopping off over here.
[15:23.180 --> 15:27.560]  I'm not going there. That's we're all, we're all there. We're all there. Where are we dropping
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.600]  boys? And we just kick the door open and get out. Well, you can't kick the door open because other
[15:31.600 --> 15:34.700]  people are like drinking their sodas and it's going to make a, that's a kerfuffle, right?
[15:34.740 --> 15:39.400]  There's a drop zone. Maybe if there was a room in the back, that's got like a main door.
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.540]  Geoff, that's the, that's the travel innovation fund that Andrew is requesting.
[15:43.720 --> 15:50.260]  I'm all for it. Yeah. Can you jump out of a movie or a plane and skydive? Is that too fast?
[15:50.520 --> 15:58.720]  At what point are you going too fast to skydive? What are you, what are you asking at the first
[15:58.720 --> 16:06.660]  part of what you just asked? Because you, I feel like, you know, like in Maverick two or Top Gun
[16:06.660 --> 16:13.080]  two, it's not Maverick two, it's he's Maverick in the second run. He's like flying through space
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.420]  or something in the beginning and he's going super fast. I feel like there's a speed in which
[16:17.420 --> 16:23.800]  you can't hop out of a plane. And I was just curious if airlines, do they get that? I feel
[16:23.800 --> 16:31.460]  like you can jump, right? Because DB Cooper jumped. So it says the plane you're traveling at
[16:31.460 --> 16:39.100]  flying at about roughly 100 miles an hour when you're skydiving. So a flight at 33,000 feet
[16:39.700 --> 16:44.820]  like a commercial airliner is probably flying at about 300 or 350 miles an hour. So it'd be zippy.
[16:45.140 --> 16:51.320]  It'd be zippy. I think the thing that might be more dangerous would be the temperature outside
[16:51.320 --> 16:56.560]  the plane at the height that that plane is flying. See, but we're, you guys are still within the
[16:56.560 --> 17:02.540]  confines of where we're at now. Andrew's saying, what if there was innovation for fun? And I'm,
[17:02.580 --> 17:09.760]  I'm on board. We probably would get skin suits that keep you warm at 33,000 feet going 350
[17:09.760 --> 17:16.360]  miles an hour that let us cut through the air. No problem. That's what would have been innovated.
[17:16.440 --> 17:20.460]  I'm okay with that. I'm totally on board with that. I was just, I'm just throwing out what
[17:20.460 --> 17:26.980]  the problem is to overcome. Yeah, we got to solve them. But I do. I love the idea of a plane that
[17:26.980 --> 17:31.640]  instead of just landing at DFW, it does a couple of zigzags over Austin for anybody that wants to
[17:31.640 --> 17:35.980]  jump out and just go straight home and just fucking cut the airplane altogether. Anyone need to go here?
[17:36.260 --> 17:41.060]  You guys close here? We good with this? What are you doing with your luggage? You figure it out.
[17:41.720 --> 17:45.120]  That there's, there's got to be some kind of innovation for luggage. I only had a backpack.
[17:46.740 --> 17:51.340]  I've only got a backpack. Where's your parachute? What about a little backpack parachute?
[17:53.020 --> 17:58.400]  We'll strap it on, it shoots down with you. Wear your backpack on the front. Parachute backpack
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.360]  on the back. There you go. Well, I think it would be a thing clearly where you can't just land
[18:02.360 --> 18:07.740]  wherever you want from the thing. There'd be like a landing zone. Oh, that takes away most of the
[18:07.740 --> 18:14.620]  benefit. No. I want to land on my front door. No, that's crazy. We can't be having that because
[18:14.620 --> 18:20.460]  then you just got people fucking parachuting in from all over the city. Like it's just complete
[18:20.460 --> 18:26.440]  chaos. There needs to be a landing area. And in movies and like military movies, they have those
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.240]  things where they like wrap up all of the packages and then shoot them at the plane and they have a
[18:31.240 --> 18:36.980]  parachute. Do that. What, like a like a loadout drop? Yeah, you check it and it's like a loadout
[18:36.980 --> 18:42.380]  box and they know, OK, the people that are dropping here need their shit pushed out at this point.
[18:44.320 --> 18:49.860]  It's that that is what a direct flight is. A direct flight is no jumpers. You're just going
[18:49.860 --> 18:55.200]  there as fast as possible. I'd be so down in the dumps if I dived out of a commercial airliner
[18:55.740 --> 19:02.440]  and then had to get on a bus. Yeah, well, I want to land right in my front lawn.
[19:02.840 --> 19:07.460]  I agree. And this is this is the problem with innovation, Eric, is we just introduced this
[19:07.460 --> 19:13.180]  idea that you can fucking jump from a plane, you'll save. And Gavin's upset about the bus ride
[19:13.180 --> 19:18.360]  after he lands. We just created this whole new thing. And now he's mad that he has to take a bus.
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.740]  You're jumping out of a plane. How's that any quicker? I might as well just land in the airport,
[19:22.980 --> 19:27.620]  get my luggage and just get in a car there. The plane's not landing there. The plane's landing
[19:27.620 --> 19:32.980]  in DFW. You just have to get out. You're not getting anyone over the age of 40 to jump out
[19:32.980 --> 19:38.240]  this plane. That's fine. Oh, Geoff's jumping. Well, we'll see. Oh, you need to have a license. You
[19:38.240 --> 19:42.460]  can't just jump. My jumping out of the plane is contingent upon how much of a kerfuffle the day
[19:42.460 --> 19:48.020]  has been up to that point. You're on a regular flight. Your flight gets canceled. You're like,
[19:48.060 --> 19:55.020]  oh, stand by on an earlier one. OK, but this is a non lander. Let me suit up.
[19:56.280 --> 20:00.100]  I guess what would you do if, let's say, you slept through your drop your drop point
[20:00.680 --> 20:05.120]  and then you have to let you just, I guess, jump out at the next city that they're flying over to
[20:05.120 --> 20:10.000]  get. That's on you. You got to figure that out. That's definitely on you. I'm just it's the funny
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.660]  problem to have. Just stay on the plane at that point. Oh, but every time, like the longer you
[20:15.660 --> 20:20.600]  stay, the further away you're getting from where you're supposed to get out. If I'm above Houston,
[20:20.680 --> 20:25.700]  I'm already astronomically too far away. Is Austin your landing zone in this hypothetical?
[20:26.380 --> 20:30.720]  Yeah, I live in Austin. Yeah, I mean, we're talking about jumping on a plane.
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.080]  I just said the country's so damn big that the next city over doesn't mean anything.
[20:38.280 --> 20:43.120]  I might as well be in Pensacola. Don't go there. Yeah, I've been hearing some
[20:43.120 --> 20:48.680]  negative stuff about that. Yeah, no, it's fine. When you're starting a business,
[20:48.680 --> 20:52.620]  it's insanely stressful. It feels like you're spinning 16 plates at once.
[20:52.620 --> 20:57.680]  And as you proceed, they only multiply. It's why I'm so thankful for an incredible service

[24:21.660 --> 24:28.580]  but regulation five zero off. Snuck that one in. Today, I learned that Alabama borders Florida.
[24:30.460 --> 24:35.720]  That's crazy. There's a band called the Floribama line, I think, isn't there?
[24:35.720 --> 24:39.380]  That shouldn't be. It's Florida Georgia line, but yeah, don't worry about it.
[24:39.380 --> 24:44.400]  There's a bar called the Floribama that my dad used to go to all the time. Right there.
[24:44.860 --> 24:50.440]  That must be I'm conflating those two things. But yeah. What state borders would have the
[24:50.440 --> 24:57.140]  best name combination? Like Florida is pretty cool. Florida is not bad. I like Kentucky and
[24:57.140 --> 25:01.020]  Tennessee would be fun because you can call it Tennessee, which is pretty close to Tennessee.
[25:01.200 --> 25:06.700]  That's exciting for me. It's close to Hennessy as well. What about North and South Dakota?
[25:07.520 --> 25:11.060]  Oh, I mean, that would just be Dakota. You could do that.
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.900]  Arkansas and Oklahoma could be our Oklahoma. Oh, I like that. I like our Oklahoma.
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.440]  Nebraska and this. Oh, I like that. I like that a lot.
[25:22.800 --> 25:27.240]  Yeah. And that's what these flights are called, because you can jump in either of these states.
[25:28.940 --> 25:32.940]  Where am I flying? Nebraska? That's where this plane is going.
[25:34.380 --> 25:38.080]  I would take that. Do you guys remember way back in episode,
[25:38.280 --> 25:43.480]  I believe, 59 when I read an email that I got to saw right from an Amazon employee who was telling
[25:43.480 --> 25:48.620]  us about how our podcast is affecting the metrics? Yeah, I believe it was episode 60. But yeah,
[25:48.660 --> 25:52.380]  go ahead. I just just so we don't get comments on it. Are you sure? I thought it was episode 59
[25:52.380 --> 25:56.380]  because people have been talking about it to me already. Already? Yeah. I've had people mention
[25:56.380 --> 26:02.500]  it. Like this email I just received. Whoa. There's been a second email.
[26:02.940 --> 26:05.920]  Which is why I thought it was episode 59, because somebody must have heard it in the second email.
[26:06.140 --> 26:09.340]  I guess it was in 59 then. I have it marked as 60. All right.
[26:09.740 --> 26:14.200]  Hi, Geoff. My name is Taylor and I work for Amazon and can attest to the podcast messing
[26:14.200 --> 26:17.860]  with our inventory. I thought it was crazy because it would be the same items talked
[26:17.860 --> 26:22.360]  about on the podcast. Glad to know there are other Amazonians out there. Current hot dog count 82.
[26:23.180 --> 26:30.760]  So Taylor is the fucking boss. First of all, 82 hot dogs. Jesus Christ.
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.980]  That's crazy. That's it. That's a lot. 30 hot dogs more than I have. Like, is he all right?
[26:37.520 --> 26:43.660]  I need to know when they start. Yeah, right. I assume I assume when everybody says they started
[26:43.660 --> 26:49.980]  on August 1st when we did. But who knows how much would you pay for to find out your total count
[26:49.980 --> 26:55.840]  lifetime? Zero. You wouldn't want to pay 20 bucks to learn that you'd had X amount of hot dogs.
[26:56.140 --> 26:59.680]  No, I don't care. I'd pay $200 for that information.
[27:00.240 --> 27:03.960]  I'd be more interested in paying for your information in that regard.
[27:04.620 --> 27:10.160]  Well, that's confidential shit. That's a it's a it's a HIPAA violation. Yeah,
[27:10.160 --> 27:14.900]  unfortunately, between you and your doctor, how many hot dogs you've eaten? It's a hot dog
[27:14.900 --> 27:21.900]  violation. I like because I feel like you've probably had less than 50. I mean, you've had
[27:21.900 --> 27:29.540]  less than the yearly average lifetime. Oh, wow. Oh, under 70 for sure. I don't like that you
[27:29.540 --> 27:35.760]  might be right. I'm definitely right. I think he's probably right. I think so. I would say
[27:35.760 --> 27:40.460]  that this is the most hot dogs you've ever had in a year, probably. And you're at like five or six.
[27:41.640 --> 27:49.540]  Yeah. Well, there was that year of DHD. I had a few. Yeah. I feel like I would just assume that
[27:49.540 --> 27:57.300]  you were in the hot dog atmosphere but weren't engaging in the doggery. Like, I think there
[27:57.300 --> 28:02.280]  was a lot of dog happening around you, but I don't think you were actually taking part. I would
[28:02.280 --> 28:06.420]  assume knowing you. Yeah, you don't have that dog in you. You just have it adjacent to you. Yeah,
[28:06.500 --> 28:13.140]  your dog. Yeah. I have that dog near me. You've got that dog near you. What? Why? Why is hot dog
[28:13.140 --> 28:21.320]  such a popular food in the U.S. that nobody sells? What's with that? Nobody sells? It feels like it's
[28:21.320 --> 28:25.700]  a special occasion food because you get it at like barbecues or you have to like go out of your
[28:25.700 --> 28:33.020]  way for it. Like, hamburger everywhere. Hot dog? Few hot dog. It's true. There's no hot dog fast
[28:33.020 --> 28:36.720]  food restaurants in Austin that you just drive through. There's not a hot dog drive-thru in
[28:36.720 --> 28:40.420]  Austin. No, there's like, you go to like Sonic Burger and that's it. You know what I mean?
[28:40.760 --> 28:45.620]  The best you can hope for is that a hot dog is attached to a hamburger at a burger restaurant.
[28:46.500 --> 28:51.740]  Like, Five Guys has a hot dog. Has a hot dog, but I think it's not on the menu anymore.
[28:51.740 --> 28:56.740]  Canada. There's a Canadian chain called New York Fries that's the only fast food
[28:56.740 --> 29:01.600]  hot dog I can think of. Yeah, that's like Sonic Burger does the hot dog.
[29:03.180 --> 29:06.400]  I don't know who else you can drive through. Wienerschnitzel? Wienerschnitzel, I guess. There's
[29:06.400 --> 29:12.720]  one. I think there's one Wienerschnitzel in Austin. Is it? But like, it is odd. In Austin, it's bar
[29:12.720 --> 29:16.660]  food. Like, most bars have a good hot dog. Like, that place that Eric and I went to and had hot
[29:16.660 --> 29:22.760]  dogs not that long ago, Frazier's Long and Low. Yeah, if you have like a lot of time to watch a
[29:22.760 --> 29:27.660]  waitress flirt with a guy at the other end of the longest bar you've ever sat at, then go check it out.
[29:27.680 --> 29:32.640]  Jesus Christ, man! There's fucking eight people in this whole bar. I just want to order my fucking
[29:32.640 --> 29:38.480]  hot dog, lady! God, I think it has to be because you don't prep hot dogs in the same way, right?
[29:38.500 --> 29:44.120]  I guess Costco, another like, if you want to call it fast food, cafeteria, it's another dog. But
[29:44.120 --> 29:48.640]  it's not, it's like it needs a unique cooking system as opposed to a burger.
[29:49.320 --> 29:53.000]  Although, I wonder if you could do smash dogs. I wonder what that would taste like.
[29:53.880 --> 29:59.400]  That's probably gross. That's probably terrible. No, I think you, I think we're about to invent
[29:59.400 --> 30:05.940]  smash dogs, Andrew. Smash burgers are so popular right now. We've got a smash dog. It would just
[30:05.940 --> 30:11.260]  look like... Oh, we're going to smash dog, write this down. We're going to become smash dog
[30:11.260 --> 30:16.580]  billionaires because we're going to invent something new. Oh, my God. Smash dogs. Smash
[30:16.580 --> 30:21.660]  dog might be a secret mayo for me. Or if you didn't tell me it was the smash dog and I just
[30:21.660 --> 30:27.360]  ate it, not knowing what had occurred, I could see myself really liking it. But going into it,
[30:28.300 --> 30:34.200]  knowing... Is smash dog a thing where you cut it in half and then smash it down or are you just
[30:34.200 --> 30:38.660]  smashing the dog down? You know what, I think cutting it in half is probably the way to go,
[30:38.660 --> 30:42.260]  but I was just imagining just smashing it down, but I think you're right. I think it's a cut.
[30:42.540 --> 30:46.480]  I just think you need a mallet. You can do it. Why would you need a mallet? Yeah,
[30:46.480 --> 30:51.180]  I think a mallet seems a little excessive. I think you just press down really hard if it's
[30:51.180 --> 30:57.580]  on like a griddle. I mean, if you don't want to use a sweet smashing mallet. While it's on the
[30:57.580 --> 31:04.340]  griddle? A mallet isn't going to smash a hot dog. It's going to obliterate it. Gavin isn't worried
[31:04.340 --> 31:09.040]  about the end result. He just wants to hit meat. Yeah, he just wants to hit a hot dog with a mallet.
[31:09.340 --> 31:12.820]  You could go for just a press with it. I just think I want a special tool for it. I don't
[31:12.820 --> 31:18.520]  want to be using a spatula or whatever. Your special tool is a mallet? I feel like Gavin
[31:18.520 --> 31:23.020]  is trying to get into cock and ball torture and this is as close as it's going to get
[31:23.020 --> 31:32.040]  to smash a hot dog with a mallet. It's nothing to do with ball. Oh no! Nothing to do with ball.
[31:32.040 --> 31:37.560]  Now when you say mallet, do you mean like a metal, like a meat hammer? Or are we talking like a croquet
[31:38.680 --> 31:44.460]  like type thing? I'm talking wooden stick, wooden cylinder. So you're going full itchy and scratchy. You want to
[31:44.460 --> 31:52.020]  fucking looney tune this thing. I think if the mallet width is wider than the total smash
[31:52.020 --> 31:58.340]  diameter of the dog, it's great. It'll be real nice and even. Can I pitch you this if you
[31:58.340 --> 32:02.640]  want, because you're talking about actually wanting like a tool, a special tool for this.
[32:03.280 --> 32:09.300]  What if it was like a mallet that could heat up at the end of it? So it's like a double grill.
[32:09.520 --> 32:16.060]  It's like a heat mallet. It's like a skillet on the circular flat part that you would smash into it.
[32:16.500 --> 32:23.320]  You grill it. You cook it from above. Double grill. Should we get a little grill, little griddle top
[32:23.320 --> 32:28.240]  for the office and then make these? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think that's a I don't think
[32:28.240 --> 32:32.340]  I have a black stone at home. We could do it at my house, but it feels I would feel really backwards
[32:32.340 --> 32:35.980]  if we filmed at my house after paying for the office. So we'll just have to make it work there.
[32:37.600 --> 32:43.680]  I'm trying to think like the sketchiest way to do you could get I have a mini it's essentially a
[32:43.680 --> 32:49.520]  mini waffle maker, but it is just like a mini skillet. You could probably like tape that to
[32:49.520 --> 32:54.920]  a wooden mallet. And then, you know what? You know what already exists that does everything
[32:54.920 --> 33:01.480]  we want to do? What's that? An iron. Oh, you just heat up an iron and drop it on,
[33:01.580 --> 33:05.380]  smash it on top of the hot dog. And then instead of spraying water out the front,
[33:05.900 --> 33:10.940]  mustard and ketchup. I don't. What are you guys talking about? How do you? Oh,
[33:12.640 --> 33:16.240]  that's an idea. Here's the thing, though. I like your mustard and ketchup,
[33:16.240 --> 33:21.320]  but you know, like the way to melt cheese is you throw a little water down and then you like put a
[33:21.320 --> 33:26.300]  container over the thing. Maybe you still need the water. And it's just for like cheese melting.
[33:27.040 --> 33:31.180]  We'll have to do some experiments. How do you guys think a smash burger is? You think there's
[33:31.180 --> 33:36.360]  like an iron on a smash burger that's pressing it down? No, it's just like I have a I have a
[33:36.360 --> 33:42.320]  burger press. No, there's like a metal. There's like a yeah, like a big fat metal disc with a
[33:42.320 --> 33:47.980]  handle on it that smashes down on. An iron does the same thing. The iron does the same thing because
[33:47.980 --> 33:53.880]  it's long and hot dog shaped, whereas the the griddle smasher is round and won't work for a
[33:53.880 --> 33:58.100]  hot dog because it's wiener shaped. So we need to get something wiener shaped. And the only thing I
[33:58.100 --> 34:03.260]  can think of that's heavy and does the same job, it already exists. It's an iron. An iron is a
[34:03.260 --> 34:10.880]  really good thought. OK, then I guess an iron it is. I have a I have like a spatula cast iron
[34:12.380 --> 34:16.820]  like flat top that I can bring to like and just put it like on the stove top. I can bring let's
[34:16.820 --> 34:21.240]  do this. Oh yeah, please do. Thank you. And then we iron on the top. I'm pretty into this idea.
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.900]  I would like to see what cutting them in half and then smashing them down would be versus just
[34:25.900 --> 34:29.640]  smashing them down with an iron, because I think one way would work maybe better than the other.
[34:29.840 --> 34:34.640]  But let me ask you this. Are they so smashed that they're go like are they going to fit in a hot
[34:34.640 --> 34:39.040]  dog bun? That's exactly what I was about to say is I think we need to consider about the bun. Yeah,
[34:39.040 --> 34:44.300]  I think you would spread what's what the result over the top of the open bun and then just kind of
[34:44.300 --> 34:50.480]  like you and then chop it in. I think it would be like everybody watch a TikTok on how to make a
[34:50.480 --> 34:54.740]  smash burger. I think the process is much the same. You probably take the bun and heat it up
[34:54.740 --> 34:59.440]  and then stick it on top of the smash dog, which is probably covered in cheese and onions. Right.
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.060]  And then slide a spatula under it, flip it over and then fold it into it. Right. But I'm but I'm
[35:04.060 --> 35:07.940]  asking, is it a hot dog bun or a hamburger bun? I think it might be a hamburger going to get so
[35:07.940 --> 35:14.760]  wide. I think it'll get too wide. It's a fucking hot dog bun. I'm asking. I'm not. I'm not trying
[35:14.760 --> 35:18.280]  to go for one or the other. I want to make sure that we're all on the same page. Are you trying
[35:18.280 --> 35:26.300]  to make a smash dog or a pulverized dog burger? Gavin's right. That would be a pulverized dog
[35:26.300 --> 35:32.620]  burger. Yeah, I don't think so. Here's the thing. I agree that it feels wrong, but I just don't think
[35:32.620 --> 35:38.400]  it's going to fit in a hot dog bun. I think it'll get too wide. It'll fit. I don't think so. It'll
[35:38.400 --> 35:43.260]  fit. But it's the wrong shape. Fold it over. It's going to be moldable, though. You can shape it
[35:43.260 --> 35:47.940]  however you want to. I don't want it to be moldable. I don't want my smash dog to be moldable. I want
[35:47.940 --> 35:53.460]  it to be very crispy and rigid. It's going to be crispy and rigid and foldable. It's going to be
[35:53.460 --> 35:59.640]  fine. I've got an additional question about it. What would happen if we shucked the dog?
[36:01.180 --> 36:08.900]  Shucked? What does that mean? Take the skin off? Yeah. Oh, like the casing. Oh, that's part of it.
[36:09.140 --> 36:14.320]  That is, it's textural. I think that's the thing that'll really like, like crisps. That's what's
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.520]  going to crisp up. Yeah. Okay. So I don't think we get rid of that. I think that'd be a terrible.
[36:18.820 --> 36:24.200]  I think that's a bad thing. Yeah, keep it. I just, I don't like, I agree. I don't like the optics of
[36:24.200 --> 36:29.100]  it in a hamburger bun, but I do think it works better in a hamburger bun. We're just going to
[36:29.100 --> 36:34.320]  have to, we'll try both ways and we'll just have to see. I think we'll know pretty quick what it's
[36:34.320 --> 36:38.660]  going to fit in. I'm feeling pretty good about this. It might need its own bun. It might need
[36:38.660 --> 36:45.440]  a smash dog bun. Interesting. Interesting. It's like a smash bun. I'm trying to think what that
[36:45.440 --> 36:55.020]  would be. Well, I hit the bun with a mallet. That's what makes smash buns unique is you
[36:55.020 --> 37:00.420]  personally hit. It's just a bun factory with you with a mallet at the end of the conveyor.
[37:02.140 --> 37:08.300]  Essentially stamping them. I'm sometimes worried at how much Tom and Jerry has just infected the
[37:08.300 --> 37:16.080]  core piece of my brain. Inspiration for some of us. Yeah. While we're on the subject of food,
[37:16.760 --> 37:21.920]  uh, I have a serial killer update. Oh! A couple of days ago, I think on Monday,
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.760]  went outside, found a, Emily found a dead bird over by the bird feeder and she asked me to,
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.120]  you know, remove it. And, uh, it was missing its eyes and something had, something had
[37:33.120 --> 37:39.620]  cracked its brain open and eaten its brain. And so the bird was fully intact. It was just missing
[37:39.620 --> 37:44.900]  two eyeballs. And then it had like a drill or like a cracked area where something had sucked its brain
[37:44.900 --> 37:50.100]  out. So, uh, it's getting, it's getting, it's getting real dark over here in my front yard.
[37:50.100 --> 37:53.680]  I mean, the eyes are attached to the brain. Do you think it just came out?
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.620]  It's possible. The back? It's possible. The eyes are attached to the brain.
[37:58.480 --> 38:01.740]  Is everything attached to the brain? Not my leaner.
[38:03.300 --> 38:06.520]  Yeah, not after Gallop smashes it with a mallet.
[38:07.960 --> 38:11.420]  Well, the toilet seat did that. That's true. That's true.
[38:13.700 --> 38:17.760]  Geoff, are you just glad to be home? Or does it feel good just to be in your space?
[38:17.760 --> 38:21.860]  Yeah. And I didn't say I feel bad too, because I had such a nice time visiting my mom and I love
[38:21.860 --> 38:25.220]  the farm over there where they are. And I got to hang with my aunt and I really did have a good
[38:25.220 --> 38:31.600]  time. But man, it's amazing how a shitty day of travel can spoil everything that's happened in
[38:31.600 --> 38:38.180]  your life up to that moment. Travel is dread to me. I am just so fucking relieved to be home.
[38:38.280 --> 38:41.460]  And especially after I threw such a stink about how I was never going to travel again.
[38:41.960 --> 38:44.860]  And this is the second trip I've taken since my, you know.
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.080]  Well, yeah, but at least there's no one on the horizon.
[38:48.120 --> 38:51.320]  Disgusting airport airplane puke saga.
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.860]  Traveling is just like creating a list of things to go wrong.
[38:59.840 --> 39:05.100]  Like there's no it's the ultimate when it goes right. It's not like it's not exciting. It's just
[39:05.100 --> 39:10.320]  relief. It's not exciting when you land in Austin and see all your friends. Exciting to me.
[39:11.240 --> 39:11.720]  What?
[39:14.660 --> 39:19.140]  Like, is the is the end result not exciting to you?
[39:19.620 --> 39:23.520]  No, not really. I guess, like, I'm happy to be there.
[39:24.640 --> 39:25.680]  You sound it.
[39:26.260 --> 39:31.840]  It's it's if I go somewhere. If you've been in the airport, have you been there?
[39:33.020 --> 39:33.600]  To the airport?
[39:34.040 --> 39:39.260]  Yeah, no, like the state. If you've traveled, if you've only been in an airport of a place,
[39:39.820 --> 39:44.680]  is that enough to count visiting that place or do you have to leave the airport?
[39:44.980 --> 39:48.540]  I mean, if you're really struggling for conversation topics, I'd say you've been there.
[39:50.880 --> 39:54.480]  What do you mean? Like socially, like if I'm trying to talk to somebody, I was like,
[39:54.540 --> 40:00.380]  yeah, I mean, if I'm if I'm if I'm bragging about being in Detroit, I see.
[40:00.560 --> 40:01.540]  But I only went to the airport.
[40:01.980 --> 40:04.040]  OK, but you wouldn't conventionally consider that.
[40:04.700 --> 40:06.440]  I'm trying to figure out if I've been to Minnesota.
[40:06.440 --> 40:08.560]  I think I might have been.
[40:09.360 --> 40:11.720]  OK, well, what, what, when?
[40:11.940 --> 40:13.140]  OK, paint a picture.
[40:13.260 --> 40:15.960]  I think I think the first time I visited Austin,
[40:16.600 --> 40:20.920]  I think I had a connecting flight in Minnesota, but I don't know if that makes sense.
[40:21.980 --> 40:22.740]  I don't know.
[40:22.840 --> 40:24.600]  Coming from Vancouver Island, maybe.
[40:25.400 --> 40:31.180]  It could like I don't I definitely was in an airport that I've only ever been in once.
[40:31.480 --> 40:33.900]  And I just can't remember what airport that was.
[40:33.900 --> 40:35.320]  Pretty inefficient route.
[40:35.500 --> 40:39.300]  Basically flying under Canada the whole way and then going down.
[40:39.820 --> 40:42.860]  I mean, it was it was nothing about the flight was ideal.
[40:42.960 --> 40:44.900]  It was just what essentially I was able to book.
[40:45.020 --> 40:45.940]  I came in late.
[40:46.040 --> 40:47.080]  It was terrible.
[40:47.560 --> 40:52.420]  But I was just thinking about there's an airport I've been in that I don't know where it is.
[40:52.480 --> 40:53.360]  I think it's Minnesota.
[40:53.820 --> 40:55.000]  I think I've been in the Minnesota.
[40:55.200 --> 40:56.280]  Minneapolis airport.
[40:56.700 --> 40:57.480]  Oh, fuck.
[40:57.500 --> 40:58.480]  It could be Minneapolis.
[40:59.000 --> 40:59.400]  That's also.
[40:59.540 --> 41:01.560]  I mean, name another city in Minnesota.
[41:03.420 --> 41:05.660]  St. Paul, obviously, the Twin Cities.
[41:06.020 --> 41:06.980]  Yeah, it was definitely.
[41:07.040 --> 41:10.340]  And I'm thinking I was curious if they'd been there.
[41:10.500 --> 41:14.640]  I'm just thinking I've connected to a lot of airports that I've I've never visited anything
[41:14.640 --> 41:15.200]  beyond it.
[41:15.640 --> 41:17.720]  Yeah, I've been to Charlotte so many times.
[41:17.800 --> 41:20.300]  I don't think I've ever set foot elsewhere in that state.
[41:22.340 --> 41:24.680]  Just sat in those rocking chairs in the Charlotte airport.
[41:26.120 --> 41:31.540]  I've definitely been in more airports of in states than I have visited.
[41:31.540 --> 41:34.020]  States outside of it, if that makes sense.
[41:34.340 --> 41:38.660]  That's like when I was like 19, I felt like I had been to Ireland because I had a layover
[41:38.660 --> 41:40.300]  in the Dublin airport for an hour and a half.
[41:41.580 --> 41:43.220]  I tell people like, oh, yeah, I've been to Ireland.
[41:43.520 --> 41:45.480]  If you had a Guinness there, I'd say you've been to Ireland.
[41:45.860 --> 41:47.800]  I had a coffee, I believe I was underage.
[41:48.900 --> 41:49.320]  Oh, right.
[41:51.520 --> 41:53.040]  You could be in the army and underage.
[41:53.660 --> 41:54.880]  You guys keep this going.
[41:55.060 --> 41:58.640]  I think something that we won in an auction is being delivered to my house right now,
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.960]  so I got to go away for like 10 or 15 minutes.
[42:01.040 --> 42:01.380]  I'll be back.
[42:02.260 --> 42:03.640]  No worries, dude, no worries.
[42:04.360 --> 42:05.480]  Hey, Gavin, I have a question for you.
[42:05.540 --> 42:08.780]  You asked earlier how much you would pay to find out how many hot dogs you've eaten in
[42:08.780 --> 42:09.080]  your life.
[42:09.220 --> 42:14.100]  How much would you pay to see how many airports you've been to and how many times you've been
[42:14.100 --> 42:18.020]  to each airport and which airports you've been to the most in your lifetime?
[42:18.800 --> 42:21.140]  I wouldn't pay anything because I'm sure it's all in my emails.
[42:21.580 --> 42:22.000]  It's not.
[42:22.080 --> 42:25.140]  Well, you got to think like all the way back to when you were a kid and you flew.
[42:25.240 --> 42:27.180]  I didn't go to America when I was a kid, though.
[42:27.400 --> 42:28.780]  But you went to other airports, asshole.
[42:28.820 --> 42:29.600]  It's not just America.
[42:29.800 --> 42:31.260]  I'm talking about the fucking world here.
[42:32.820 --> 42:33.660]  Uh, Tenerife.
[42:34.660 --> 42:36.460]  Uh, Heathrow, Tenerife.
[42:37.220 --> 42:38.200]  Oh, no, I guess it was Luton.
[42:38.680 --> 42:39.880]  No, I didn't really go much places.
[42:40.420 --> 42:40.840]  That's sad.
[42:41.820 --> 42:46.680]  That's kind of nice, travel as a child, because I know I've been places, but I don't remember
[42:46.680 --> 42:48.020]  the travel part of it at all.
[42:48.140 --> 42:48.760]  That's great.
[42:49.360 --> 42:51.100]  It's an ideal way of experiencing that.
[42:51.540 --> 42:53.360]  I wonder how many times I've been in DFW.
[42:54.680 --> 42:59.140]  Like, surely not as many times as Austin, but close, I would think.
[42:59.800 --> 43:02.140]  I've certainly been to Dallas over a hundred times.
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.480]  I used to, when I was in the army at Fort Hood, we would fly, we would connect through
[43:06.480 --> 43:07.460]  Dallas, not Austin.
[43:07.520 --> 43:11.700]  So I'd probably been to, I probably have 20 Dallas trips under my belt that never touched
[43:11.700 --> 43:12.240]  Austin even.
[43:12.640 --> 43:15.540]  But it still can't, can't hold a candle to Austin.
[43:15.900 --> 43:16.260]  I don't know.
[43:16.780 --> 43:18.960]  We have Smash Dogs that we're looking at.
[43:19.440 --> 43:21.080]  Is there any other food that should be smashed?
[43:21.580 --> 43:22.400]  That'd be better.
[43:23.080 --> 43:26.400]  Like, I think the Smash Burger is an innovation over the base burger.
[43:26.400 --> 43:29.600]  You've got smash burgers, you've got smashed avocados.
[43:29.920 --> 43:30.500]  An egg?
[43:30.720 --> 43:31.380]  Yeah, schnitzel.
[43:31.400 --> 43:33.320]  I was just thinking egg, but I don't know if egg would work.
[43:35.300 --> 43:36.200]  Smashed boiled egg?
[43:36.700 --> 43:38.000]  Chicken fried steak.
[43:39.640 --> 43:42.280]  What else could you smash that's not smashed?
[43:42.780 --> 43:44.440]  It has to be like a meat thing, right?
[43:44.520 --> 43:45.540]  Because you're putting it on a grill.
[43:46.380 --> 43:47.660]  Smashed potatoes are delicious.
[43:47.820 --> 43:48.560]  I've had smashed potatoes.
[43:48.660 --> 43:49.080]  They're pretty good.
[43:49.240 --> 43:49.660]  They're pretty good.
[43:49.900 --> 43:50.640]  They're really good.
[43:51.240 --> 43:54.860]  What about, how do you think a drop burger would taste?
[43:55.380 --> 43:56.420]  A drop burger?
[43:57.180 --> 43:59.560]  Like you just drop it onto the skillet from a high distance?
[43:59.560 --> 44:01.580]  Drop it from like 60 stories up.
[44:01.780 --> 44:03.960]  So it's definitely like a terminal velocity burger.
[44:04.120 --> 44:04.700]  Hold on.
[44:04.820 --> 44:06.560]  A terminal velocity burger?
[44:07.320 --> 44:07.620]  Yeah.
[44:07.960 --> 44:10.580]  Terminal velocity drop burger.
[44:10.800 --> 44:12.520]  We're definitely going to film that too.
[44:12.680 --> 44:13.400]  Okay, got it.
[44:13.880 --> 44:16.460]  What is the terminal velocity of an average patty?
[44:17.180 --> 44:18.220]  Can't be that fast.
[44:19.620 --> 44:20.900]  No, I wouldn't imagine so.
[44:21.280 --> 44:22.740]  I don't even know how to search that.
[44:24.040 --> 44:25.300]  Terminal velocity of a patty?
[44:25.300 --> 44:26.400]  You're not going to find the answer.
[44:26.780 --> 44:27.260]  I wouldn't bother.
[44:28.780 --> 44:29.980]  When you said drop burger,
[44:30.120 --> 44:33.980]  I was thinking about in movies where a character jumps off a building
[44:33.980 --> 44:37.520]  and falls through multiple awnings to safely land.
[44:37.840 --> 44:40.560]  If there was like a cooking method of that,
[44:41.220 --> 44:44.480]  where like you could get the exact doneness you wanted
[44:44.480 --> 44:47.140]  based on how many things it fell through.
[44:47.840 --> 44:48.960]  Like how many heat zones?
[44:49.460 --> 44:51.020]  Yeah, or like, I don't know.
[44:51.680 --> 44:53.520]  There's no way to like heat those.
[44:54.020 --> 44:54.760]  And then they break.
[44:54.840 --> 44:55.880]  It would be a terrible product.
[44:56.660 --> 44:58.200]  Where would you get one of those to replace?
[44:58.440 --> 45:01.340]  What an annoying thing to have Indiana Jones break
[45:01.340 --> 45:04.900]  seven of those in the apartment complex that you own or whatever.
[45:06.040 --> 45:07.740]  I don't know where you'd get one of those.
[45:08.120 --> 45:09.220]  Where do you get one of those?
[45:09.740 --> 45:09.920]  eBay.
[45:11.160 --> 45:11.520]  eBay?
[45:12.160 --> 45:13.560]  eBay? You want a secondhand awning?
[45:14.060 --> 45:15.400]  It's an insane way to get an awning.
[45:15.800 --> 45:16.360]  Never know.
[45:16.620 --> 45:18.900]  I don't think I've ever seen an awning in the wild.
[45:18.900 --> 45:22.660]  My cousin used to work for an awning company that would install awnings
[45:22.660 --> 45:25.740]  at like restaurants and commercial buildings and stuff.
[45:25.800 --> 45:26.380]  I could ask him.
[45:26.700 --> 45:29.020]  Do you think there's a company that sells awnings and mattresses
[45:29.020 --> 45:30.300]  and it's called Awnings and Yawnings?
[45:31.160 --> 45:32.360]  Awnings and Yawnings?
[45:34.840 --> 45:35.320]  Yeah.
[45:38.020 --> 45:41.700]  If we ever had a, if we ever had, and I've thought about this a few times,
[45:42.160 --> 45:44.240]  a subdivision of regulation
[45:44.240 --> 45:48.220]  where we just make merch of all the fake companies and ideas that we...
[45:48.220 --> 45:53.980]  I would love an Awnings and Yawnings t-shirt for the fake Awnings and Yawnings company.
[45:54.080 --> 45:56.920]  Yeah, all these like uniform owned companies that no one's heard of.
[45:57.340 --> 45:59.640]  That don't exist. Exist only in t-shirt form.
[46:00.440 --> 46:04.560]  I, uh, I had something happen to me in my car a couple days ago,
[46:04.620 --> 46:09.060]  two days ago, three days ago now, that made me think I was losing my fucking mind.
[46:09.240 --> 46:10.320]  Can I share that? Can I share it with you?
[46:10.640 --> 46:11.220]  Yeah, of course.
[46:11.400 --> 46:14.460]  I got into my car the other day, which I know very well because it's been my car.
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.160]  Sorry, Gavin's car for a very long time.
[46:16.480 --> 46:16.780]  Thank you.
[46:16.780 --> 46:22.800]  It's not new to me or anything, but I got in my car and I looked down to change the temperature
[46:23.500 --> 46:26.520]  on the, uh, looked down to change the temperature.
[46:28.020 --> 46:32.560]  And I'm going to show you, that's the dashboard where you can see the temperature gauge, right?
[46:32.980 --> 46:33.200]  Nice.
[46:33.260 --> 46:37.340]  And I noticed that next to me on mine, where it says 69, it's blue.
[46:37.460 --> 46:39.900]  And then over on the other side, it was orange and said 69.
[46:40.200 --> 46:43.180]  And it's always been white the entire time I've owned my car.
[46:43.440 --> 46:46.140]  And so when I sat in and I went, I was driving and I looked down and I go,
[46:46.140 --> 46:48.300]  why the fuck is this side blue and this side red?
[46:48.420 --> 46:52.000]  And then I thought like, oh, is it like, do I have the heat on one side and the cool on the other
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.360]  side? But it's no, because it's the same temperature dialed in.
[46:54.460 --> 46:56.680]  And I'm thinking, did my car?
[46:57.320 --> 46:57.940]  We'll get there.
[46:58.100 --> 46:59.800]  Did my car? I'd love to know what if you do know.
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.900]  Did my car update in some way?
[47:02.220 --> 47:04.320]  And I got some sort of a firmware update.
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.220]  And, uh, but then I thought, no, because that's never happened before.
[47:10.260 --> 47:13.360]  I've had this car for like five years and it's never had an auto update
[47:13.360 --> 47:17.240]  to like the dashboard firmware or anything without me taking it into the dealer.
[47:17.760 --> 47:21.740]  And so I thought, well, next time I stopped, I sat in the car and I like look through the
[47:21.740 --> 47:24.100]  settings and it's like, is this something I accidentally enabled?
[47:24.260 --> 47:25.520]  I was losing my fucking mind.
[47:25.700 --> 47:26.740]  Well, what is going on here?
[47:26.760 --> 47:27.300]  I'm looking at the settings.
[47:27.360 --> 47:29.380]  I can't find anything that's changed.
[47:29.580 --> 47:34.520]  There's no setting to change like the color palette of the temperature controls.
[47:34.920 --> 47:39.660]  And I was fucking stumped and I couldn't figure out why one side was orange and one side was blue.
[47:40.240 --> 47:43.740]  And and I was literally thinking I was going crazy.
[47:43.740 --> 47:46.160]  And I was like, did somebody is somebody fucking with me?
[47:46.160 --> 47:50.120]  Because that's not that's not how it works.
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.220]  And then I figured it out.
[47:52.440 --> 47:54.320]  Can I got it to look like that?
[47:54.820 --> 47:56.360]  Gavin, would you like to guess?
[47:57.420 --> 47:58.440]  You're wearing sunglasses.
[47:58.760 --> 48:00.780]  I was wearing polarizing sunglasses.
[48:02.320 --> 48:06.240]  My wife got me a pair of polarizing sunglasses for my birthday.
[48:06.240 --> 48:12.780]  And I swear to God, I have owned polarizing sunglasses before, but never have they changed
[48:12.780 --> 48:14.780]  the colors of stuff I look at.
[48:14.960 --> 48:18.100]  And then I realized everything looks like that with those sunglasses.
[48:18.340 --> 48:22.280]  And I just hadn't noticed it because I wasn't staring at something that was pure white that
[48:22.280 --> 48:22.940]  close before.
[48:23.020 --> 48:23.440]  You know what I mean?
[48:23.960 --> 48:25.140]  Yeah, it was my sunglasses.
[48:25.300 --> 48:28.720]  But for about seven minutes, I thought I was losing my fucking mind.
[48:29.040 --> 48:30.360]  I had the same exact thing.
[48:30.960 --> 48:34.960]  It was right when I started wearing Shady Ray sunglasses, which are polarized.
[48:35.860 --> 48:39.000]  I was setting up two Phantoms on a shoot.
[48:39.080 --> 48:40.280]  It was a shoot with Adam Savage.
[48:40.580 --> 48:43.360]  And I just couldn't get one of the freaking monitors to work.
[48:43.640 --> 48:44.600]  And I was like rummaging around.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.460]  I was like replacing cables.
[48:46.580 --> 48:47.940]  I was like checking the battery.
[48:48.060 --> 48:49.480]  I was like powering it with a different cable.
[48:49.740 --> 48:53.100]  And then my sunglasses just slipped down and it was on the whole time.
[48:53.420 --> 48:55.700]  And I'd been troubleshooting a monitor that was on.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.680]  I just couldn't see that particular screen.
[48:59.280 --> 49:00.900]  But the other one, it didn't do that on.
[49:01.340 --> 49:03.220]  It's just like one of my screens.
[49:03.400 --> 49:05.220]  I couldn't see through my sunglasses.
[49:06.880 --> 49:08.880]  We're so stupid.
[49:09.980 --> 49:12.240]  Apparently, I was just reading the comments.
[49:12.480 --> 49:13.360]  The comments on 59.
[49:13.980 --> 49:17.260]  Apparently, we're all the dumbest people on earth for our pasta takes.
[49:17.500 --> 49:19.780]  And people can't believe how stupid we are.
[49:20.040 --> 49:22.300]  Wait, what was the... how are we dumb for pasta?
[49:22.640 --> 49:23.440]  I don't think we are.
[49:23.560 --> 49:24.900]  But everybody read the comments.
[49:25.060 --> 49:28.620]  Everybody's like that was the dumbest thing I've ever listened to.
[49:28.680 --> 49:29.380]  They're all stupid.
[49:29.920 --> 49:33.700]  I thought... I convinced myself for like six months that I was...
[49:33.700 --> 49:36.600]  I became colorblind because of Sea of Thieves.
[49:37.280 --> 49:40.160]  You have diggable maps with a red X on them.
[49:40.520 --> 49:42.760]  And then one day it just turned to white.
[49:43.500 --> 49:45.320]  And I thought, that's weird.
[49:45.440 --> 49:46.720]  And then it was always like that.
[49:46.960 --> 49:50.840]  And you can show people your map in that game.
[49:50.900 --> 49:51.680]  And I showed someone.
[49:51.760 --> 49:53.460]  I said, what color is that X?
[49:53.600 --> 49:54.220]  Do you see that?
[49:54.540 --> 49:55.380]  And they're like, oh, it's red.
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.920]  And I was... I just didn't want to... I don't know.
[49:57.920 --> 49:59.260]  I was nervous about it.
[49:59.500 --> 50:01.480]  So I didn't want to say what I was seeing.
[50:01.900 --> 50:04.020]  So I spent a period of time thinking, like,
[50:04.060 --> 50:07.220]  do I just see a certain shade of red as white now?
[50:07.540 --> 50:09.140]  Did something happen to my eyes?
[50:09.440 --> 50:12.920]  And then I realized it was a setting that I had accidentally turned on in accessibility.
[50:13.740 --> 50:16.960]  Yeah, like a colorblind type thing.
[50:17.020 --> 50:19.800]  So I just had shifted the color and I had no idea that I did it.
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.800]  But I was quietly freaking out for several months
[50:22.800 --> 50:26.440]  that I could no longer see that certain shade of red as red.
[50:27.940 --> 50:29.200]  We're all color dumb.
[50:30.640 --> 50:34.040]  No, spaghetti is not a dish and doesn't require tomato sauce.
[50:34.260 --> 50:35.560]  Spaghetti is just a pasta type.
[50:35.740 --> 50:36.680]  Isn't that what we said, though?
[50:36.960 --> 50:38.040]  No, that's what I was asking.
[50:38.700 --> 50:38.880]  Yeah.
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.380]  I was very confused about it because I thought baked spaghetti is the dish
[50:44.380 --> 50:46.000]  and not just you're baking the noodle.
[50:46.600 --> 50:47.960]  I still am kind of confused.
[50:48.060 --> 50:53.140]  And then people were upset that we called spaghetti sauce or marinara red sauce.
[50:53.260 --> 50:54.380]  And they're like, stop doing that.
[50:54.460 --> 50:56.560]  Nobody else... that's just a dumb American thing.
[50:56.560 --> 50:58.900]  And I'm like, I wasn't I wasn't using this.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.200]  I don't think that's the official fucking term or anything.
[51:01.280 --> 51:03.640]  I'm just having a colloquial conversation.
[51:05.220 --> 51:05.620]  Damn.
[51:06.100 --> 51:08.560]  Is marinara the same as the spaghetti sauce?
[51:10.020 --> 51:11.020]  Are those different?
[51:11.080 --> 51:12.200]  I always thought they were different.
[51:12.300 --> 51:15.140]  I thought I view marinara as like the pizza dipping sauce.
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.060]  Well, there's marinara and tomato sauce.
[51:17.380 --> 51:17.980]  OK, they're different.
[51:18.400 --> 51:20.520]  Spaghetti sauce isn't a thing.
[51:20.640 --> 51:21.540]  I think that's what people are saying.
[51:22.020 --> 51:22.480]  Oh, yeah.
[51:22.900 --> 51:26.740]  Spaghetti is the multiple spaghetto.
[51:27.360 --> 51:27.560]  Yes.
[51:27.620 --> 51:30.740]  What's weird, though, is I don't have that sauce and anything outside of spaghetti.
[51:31.240 --> 51:32.380]  Where's that sauce going?
[51:32.820 --> 51:36.740]  All I'm saying is that when you order spaghetti on a menu in America,
[51:36.740 --> 51:38.620]  you get spaghetti and red sauce.
[51:38.800 --> 51:39.840]  Call it whatever the fuck you want to.
[51:39.960 --> 51:40.660]  Bolognese, whatever.
[51:40.800 --> 51:42.580]  You get spaghetti and a red sauce on it.
[51:42.800 --> 51:44.480]  Sometimes it has meat, sometimes it doesn't.
[51:44.800 --> 51:47.120]  And that's what we in America call spaghetti.
[51:47.440 --> 51:49.940]  I feel like red sauce can be called gravy too, can't it?
[51:50.700 --> 51:51.120]  Absolutely.
[51:51.120 --> 51:53.240]  People on the East Coast call it gravy.
[51:53.660 --> 51:54.900]  Italians call it gravy.
[51:55.280 --> 51:56.060]  American Italians.
[51:56.080 --> 52:00.280]  I feel like I've heard, like, East Coast chefs be like, I do great gravy.
[52:00.420 --> 52:02.400]  All the Sopranos called it gravy.
[52:02.600 --> 52:04.500]  All the Goodfellas dudes called it gravy.
[52:05.020 --> 52:07.140]  But call it spaghetti sauce because you...
[52:08.800 --> 52:10.800]  Because on your spaghetti...
[52:10.800 --> 52:14.440]  Like, wouldn't that be like putting cereal sauce in your coffee?
[52:16.060 --> 52:20.900]  I didn't hear a thing you said because you did the thing where you tried to like...
[52:21.120 --> 52:22.880]  process the question.
[52:23.000 --> 52:23.920]  What's... you okay, Eric?
[52:24.420 --> 52:25.340]  Yeah, it's fine.
[52:25.460 --> 52:26.680]  I've just been running up and down.
[52:26.840 --> 52:31.480]  But I got really excited to come back and hear about cereal sauce for my coffee.
[52:31.800 --> 52:32.480]  That's pretty good.
[52:34.360 --> 52:34.920]  What?
[52:35.620 --> 52:36.180]  What?
[52:36.600 --> 52:38.360]  What do you call spaghetti sauce?
[52:38.860 --> 52:40.520]  I'm just saying what Gavin said.
[52:40.980 --> 52:41.820]  It's tomato sauce.
[52:42.300 --> 52:43.100]  Tomato sauce?
[52:43.720 --> 52:43.900]  Yeah.
[52:44.740 --> 52:45.240]  Bolognese?
[52:45.660 --> 52:49.660]  I'm looking at pasta sauce, chunky tomato and garlic sauce,
[52:49.660 --> 52:53.780]  traditional pasta sauce, spaghetti sauce.
[52:54.500 --> 52:55.720]  It's called a million different...
[52:55.720 --> 52:56.840]  I'm looking at ragu...
[52:56.840 --> 52:58.140]  Look at... it's...
[52:58.660 --> 53:00.320]  Listen, it's called a million different things.
[53:00.440 --> 53:01.220]  Look at a fucking label.
[53:01.700 --> 53:03.880]  Yeah, I think ragu is just like meat and sauce, right?
[53:04.260 --> 53:04.540]  Meat and...
[53:04.540 --> 53:07.900]  But like, here's some organic...
[53:08.580 --> 53:09.000]  Yeah.
[53:09.200 --> 53:11.180]  All right, I don't want to talk about spaghetti anymore.
[53:11.660 --> 53:14.100]  There's different pasta terminology around the world.
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.000]  Like, I've never called spaghetti a noodle before, but that's a common American thing.
[53:18.440 --> 53:18.660]  Yeah.
[53:19.260 --> 53:19.420]  Yeah.
[53:19.940 --> 53:21.680]  I still don't know about a chow mein.
[53:24.160 --> 53:24.920]  The noodle?
[53:25.080 --> 53:25.780]  It's a noodle, right?
[53:26.520 --> 53:27.140]  The chow mein...
[53:27.140 --> 53:27.960]  No, it's an egg noodle.
[53:28.160 --> 53:29.060]  We don't need to do this again.
[53:29.120 --> 53:29.540]  We did this.
[53:29.800 --> 53:30.100]  We...
[53:32.800 --> 53:34.540]  We recently had an...
[53:36.000 --> 53:37.700]  We recently hung out with Jack.
[53:38.680 --> 53:39.660]  Major League Fan Jack.
[53:39.660 --> 53:40.740]  Yes, thank you.
[53:41.060 --> 53:42.120]  I've been having to wait.
[53:42.380 --> 53:46.540]  So you guys met with Jack and you said that there is a photo that...
[53:48.800 --> 53:51.120]  I need to react to or like...
[53:51.120 --> 53:51.900]  I don't know.
[53:52.000 --> 53:53.020]  I guess you have it.
[53:53.420 --> 53:54.480]  I don't think...
[53:54.480 --> 53:55.120]  Do you have it, Eric?
[53:55.140 --> 53:55.760]  I don't have it.
[53:56.360 --> 53:58.120]  Was I guessing what the photo is?
[53:58.200 --> 53:59.840]  I think Eric is still doing...
[53:59.840 --> 54:01.740]  Yeah, he's doing his prop stuff.
[54:02.880 --> 54:03.240]  No.
[54:03.920 --> 54:04.640]  Could I text Jack?
[54:04.720 --> 54:05.540]  Could I ask him to send it?
[54:05.920 --> 54:06.880]  Yeah, ask him to send it.
[54:07.000 --> 54:07.640]  Ask him to send it.
[54:07.780 --> 54:09.900]  So for context, I heard that...
[54:09.900 --> 54:13.360]  I'm assuming it was part of your birthday, Geoff, that everyone was hanging out.
[54:13.700 --> 54:14.380]  Jack was there.
[54:15.020 --> 54:17.420]  And then Jack showed a photo to someone...
[54:18.400 --> 54:19.480]  Eric, I believe.
[54:20.380 --> 54:22.840]  And Eric immediately had you come look at it.
[54:23.600 --> 54:26.760]  And then it just became a thing that I don't...
[54:27.680 --> 54:33.580]  I've been trying to guess, like, what would Jack show Eric that would then turn into everybody
[54:33.580 --> 54:37.840]  ripping Jack in some sense or getting under his skin with it?
[54:38.260 --> 54:39.060]  I can't...
[54:39.060 --> 54:39.900]  I have no idea.
[54:40.280 --> 54:42.780]  I wouldn't have brought this up if I didn't think Eric was back.
[54:42.780 --> 54:44.600]  Because he was back and talking.
[54:44.720 --> 54:45.280]  Should we wait for Eric?
[54:45.740 --> 54:47.180]  So maybe we should wait for Eric.
[54:47.280 --> 54:48.240]  Because this is kind of...
[54:48.240 --> 54:50.280]  The story kind of started with him.
[54:50.400 --> 54:53.840]  And it was his incredulity that kind of fueled the whole thing.
[54:54.460 --> 54:55.360]  But it was... yeah.
[54:55.500 --> 54:56.900]  It was... we had a birthday party.
[54:57.940 --> 54:59.740]  Emily threw a birthday party for me at the house.
[55:00.040 --> 55:02.380]  And we were hanging out with Jack.
[55:02.520 --> 55:04.460]  And, like, the truck boys were there.
[55:04.680 --> 55:05.780]  And Trev and Barb.
[55:05.920 --> 55:06.780]  And a bunch of people.
[55:07.160 --> 55:07.900]  Eric, of course.
[55:08.960 --> 55:10.540]  And Nick said, fuck off.
[55:10.560 --> 55:11.040]  I'm not coming.
[55:11.360 --> 55:11.920]  Which is cool.
[55:12.020 --> 55:12.320]  It's whatever.
[55:13.180 --> 55:14.180]  I'm going on a trip.
[55:14.320 --> 55:14.960]  No, you were fine.
[55:15.080 --> 55:15.840]  It's totally fine.
[55:15.960 --> 55:16.440]  You were very sweet.
[55:17.280 --> 55:17.900]  But yeah.
[55:17.960 --> 55:19.140]  And it was good to see everybody.
[55:19.240 --> 55:20.400]  It was really good to hang out with Jack.
[55:20.540 --> 55:22.920]  And then five minutes into hanging out with Jack,
[55:22.980 --> 55:24.780]  he looked at me and goes, I remember this.
[55:25.520 --> 55:28.280]  And I had gotten under his skin.
[55:28.580 --> 55:30.340]  And he was legit annoyed with me.
[55:30.660 --> 55:35.560]  And unfortunately, I can't stop when that happens.
[55:35.980 --> 55:36.660]  You know what I mean?
[55:37.140 --> 55:41.360]  And so I just... I couldn't let it go.
[55:41.940 --> 55:42.360]  Huh.
[55:46.080 --> 55:47.880]  I said, could you send the picture?
[55:48.340 --> 55:49.200]  He said, sure.
[55:49.420 --> 55:51.500]  And sent me something that wasn't the picture.
[55:53.680 --> 55:56.600]  Yeah, so should we just wait for Eric?
[55:57.120 --> 55:58.040]  Yeah, he said to be right back.
[55:58.500 --> 55:58.780]  Okay.
[55:59.460 --> 56:00.680]  Anybody else got any notes?
[56:01.200 --> 56:02.600]  I was going to say while we wait for him,
[56:02.780 --> 56:05.660]  the polarized sunglasses reared their head again in Vegas.
[56:06.280 --> 56:06.840]  Did they?
[56:07.260 --> 56:08.100]  They did for Gavin.
[56:08.560 --> 56:08.880]  Did they?
[56:09.400 --> 56:10.000]  What did you do?
[56:10.400 --> 56:11.960]  So we were in the clubhouse.
[56:11.960 --> 56:13.940]  And because we'd been coming in and out,
[56:14.160 --> 56:16.220]  we were all wearing our sunglasses except for Eric.
[56:16.620 --> 56:20.340]  Eric had stopped at a monitor and was just staring at it.
[56:20.780 --> 56:23.180]  And he was just staring and staring like with his arms crossed,
[56:23.260 --> 56:25.020]  just kind of like scratching his chin or whatever.
[56:25.460 --> 56:27.500]  And Gavin walked up and goes, are you an idiot?
[56:29.280 --> 56:31.060]  And he's like, what are you talking about?
[56:31.240 --> 56:33.380]  And then Gavin took off his sunglasses.
[56:34.900 --> 56:38.740]  And it had been a menu for what the everything was in the area.
[56:39.040 --> 56:40.980]  Gavin's like, oh, I'm the idiot.
[56:42.400 --> 56:44.440]  Yeah, I thought he was just looking at a monitor that was off.
[56:44.560 --> 56:45.540]  I was like, are you all right?
[56:49.060 --> 56:51.620]  I got a quick life hack I stumbled onto for you guys.
[56:51.680 --> 56:52.320]  You have a life hack?
[56:52.820 --> 56:53.920]  I do. I do.
[56:55.200 --> 57:01.940]  Let's say you're the kind of person who has a fairly recent car,
[57:01.980 --> 57:03.460]  a car built in the last like five or six years.
[57:03.460 --> 57:05.460]  And you're thinking about upgrading and getting a new car.
[57:05.600 --> 57:06.760]  I'm referring to my wife.
[57:07.080 --> 57:09.500]  My wife wants a new SUV with a third row
[57:09.500 --> 57:12.760]  because we're going to be making lots of trips back and forth from Austin to Michigan.
[57:13.100 --> 57:15.460]  If, you know, after the summer, hopefully if we buy a house.
[57:15.960 --> 57:16.560]  You're going to drive?
[57:16.940 --> 57:17.660]  Well, we got the dog.
[57:17.880 --> 57:18.880]  Albert can't fly.
[57:19.220 --> 57:19.420]  Oh, yeah.
[57:19.500 --> 57:21.560]  And so he's a little too big to fly.
[57:21.660 --> 57:24.840]  And I cannot imagine Albert in an airport
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.900]  trying to lick and attack every single person in the airport.
[57:29.180 --> 57:30.380]  Like it would be a fucking nightmare.
[57:30.760 --> 57:31.760]  He'd be over. He'd explode.
[57:31.880 --> 57:34.380]  He would just he would he wouldn't know what he would vibrate until he exploded.
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.720]  And it would just be an explosion of slobber and piss.
[57:41.340 --> 57:43.680]  So we've been looking at new cars lately.
[57:43.680 --> 57:45.180]  We've been looking at new SUVs.
[57:45.220 --> 57:46.220]  And let me tell you something.
[57:46.500 --> 57:49.200]  SUVs are fucking expensive in 2025.
[57:49.800 --> 57:53.600]  And they have gotten and I recognize people are like, yeah, no shit, dumb ass.
[57:53.640 --> 57:54.620]  Everything's expensive in 2025.
[57:54.800 --> 57:55.520]  I get it.
[57:55.540 --> 57:58.240]  I just haven't bought a car since like 2019, 2020.
[57:58.480 --> 58:00.520]  And so it's my first experience going.
[58:00.620 --> 58:01.280]  I guess that's not true.
[58:01.320 --> 58:05.320]  I bought Millie's car, but it was very used and it was a different experience.
[58:05.500 --> 58:07.020]  So we're looking at new SUVs.
[58:07.020 --> 58:09.440]  She's looking at maybe leasing one and trading her Mercedes in.
[58:11.740 --> 58:13.800]  And they're fucking expensive.
[58:14.220 --> 58:17.440]  And honestly, I haven't been impressed with a lot.
[58:17.600 --> 58:19.300]  I was really excited to look at a Rivian.
[58:19.400 --> 58:20.160]  We test drove one.
[58:20.280 --> 58:21.360]  I got to be honest with you.
[58:21.620 --> 58:26.420]  The experience of going to the Rivian dealership in Austin was kind of dog shit.
[58:26.780 --> 58:32.360]  And the people that work there were kind of like unenthused and are trying to sell you
[58:32.360 --> 58:37.480]  an $80,000 to $110,000 fucking car and can't be bothered to give a shit.
[58:37.940 --> 58:43.480]  And they had a Nike fitness running event in their fucking showroom on a Saturday.
[58:43.660 --> 58:44.940]  It was like a special party.
[58:44.980 --> 58:46.960]  And so I couldn't go to the showroom.
[58:47.220 --> 58:51.540]  They had to make me meet them three blocks down at a fucking parking lot.
[58:51.600 --> 58:55.300]  Like I'm buying weed when I'm 19 years old at a grocery.
[58:55.360 --> 58:55.880]  You know what I mean?
[58:55.920 --> 58:57.220]  Like at the back of a Walmart.
[58:57.800 --> 59:00.800]  And so and then they like you test drive it and it's like, whatever.
[59:00.880 --> 59:01.540]  The car was fine.
[59:01.540 --> 59:02.840]  I wasn't super blown away by it.
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.960]  And then they then they had us like, well, if you want to see some information about it,
[59:06.960 --> 59:08.000]  let's walk over to the dealer.
[59:08.120 --> 59:08.640]  And you're like, OK.
[59:08.740 --> 59:11.300]  And they walk you three blocks, 110 degrees in Austin.
[59:11.460 --> 59:15.940]  And then you got to walk through all the fitness people who all look impossibly fit.
[59:16.020 --> 59:17.540]  And you're like, God, I'm a piece of shit.
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.000]  Thanks for reminding me, you know.
[59:19.140 --> 59:21.800]  And then like there's nowhere to sit because it's cool.
[59:21.880 --> 59:22.720]  It's not functional.
[59:23.080 --> 59:24.460]  Their deal, you know, their showroom.
[59:24.700 --> 59:26.120]  And so they're like talking to you a little bit.
[59:26.140 --> 59:27.280]  I was leaning against the thing.
[59:27.320 --> 59:30.480]  And then some fitness lady came over and took it away from me because of a part of their set.
[59:30.480 --> 59:31.760]  And then the whole thing just sucked.
[59:31.860 --> 59:33.880]  And I'm like, I don't want to fucking review now because of this experience.
[59:34.220 --> 59:36.560]  And so we've been looking at Chevy, a bunch of different places.
[59:37.800 --> 59:39.740]  We were in Italy's car the other day,
[59:39.780 --> 59:43.100]  and she was just going through her menu and realized you could change
[59:43.100 --> 59:45.700]  like the color palette of your heads up display.
[59:46.560 --> 59:50.400]  So we changed hers from like whatever the default was to like sport.
[59:50.640 --> 59:52.640]  And it felt like a new car.
[59:52.920 --> 59:53.760]  So here's my life.
[59:53.940 --> 59:54.920]  Here's my life hack for you.
[59:55.120 --> 59:57.740]  If you want to get a new car, but they're too expensive.
[59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.980]  See if you can change your HUD to a different color, like from blue to yellow,
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:05.960]  because it'll make you feel like you're driving a brand new fucking car for at least a month.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.300]  You'll buy yourself at least another 30 days.
[01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:10.200]  If you can't just pop on some shady rays.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.380]  Or just wear polarized sunglasses.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.320]  If you don't have that option in your car,
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:18.340]  that'll give you a really trippy new heads up display.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.880]  I'll imagine if you have both, you could have so many cars.
[01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:26.120]  The shades and the ability to change the display.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:29.740]  I think there are five default settings that you can choose from in her car.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.680]  So we have like five more months of this car before we get frustrated again.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.860]  I used to do that in Fallout.
[01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:39.300]  I would change the Pip-Boy color if the game was starting to get samey.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:40.900]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.700]  What's your favorite Pip-Boy color?
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.000]  Probably the blue.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.340]  That's what I like too.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.160]  Is there like a weird orange?
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.860]  I feel like I was a big...
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.360]  New Vegas.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.940]  The New Vegas Amber is my favorite one.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.040]  Boys, we got it.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.400]  That's amazing.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.560]  Very exciting.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.380]  We got a thing that we'll talk about at some point.
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:03.220]  It's so tall.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.980]  It has to be laid down to get in my garage.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.480]  Have we talked about this prop?
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.080]  No.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.540]  So this hasn't been discussed publicly.
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:17.300]  We didn't...
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:19.780]  We recorded that video of the auction and everything.
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.580]  That never came out.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:21.400]  No.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.260]  Okay.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.860]  When do we want to put that out?
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.660]  Because we have it.
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:26.940]  We do.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.880]  I feel like we could do more than that.
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:29.700]  I feel...
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:30.820]  The...
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.300]  Amber has a vision for it.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:33.640]  Potentially.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.960]  Yeah, it just...
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.440]  It was like the least...
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.640]  I'm so happy we got it.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.280]  It's so exciting.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.920]  I can't wait to reveal it and do stuff with it.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.660]  But I feel like the actual acquiring part was like the least eventful thing
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:47.040]  because nobody else wanted it.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.700]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.420]  I had to...
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.080]  So the truckers came and just brought it to my house.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.740]  Also, to get this thing to my house has been a fiasco
[01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.100]  because Andrew set up all the shipping.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.640]  So the guy who called me from L.A. was like,
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.560]  Hey, what's going on, Andrew?
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.000]  Where are we shipping this thing?
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.080]  And I was like, yeah, that's me.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:03.580]  I'm Andrew.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.300]  So for the last week, I've been Andrew on like...
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.400]  Why did you put your own name on it?
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.020]  A dozen different calls.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.420]  I just didn't because it feels like it's going to be one of those things
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.220]  where they're like, yeah, but the paperwork says Andrew.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.560]  Why even bother?
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.040]  But it shouldn't, which is weird.
[01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:19.540]  Like everything is listed as you.
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.120]  But anyway...
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:21.460]  Beats me. Beats me.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.280]  So he just kept...
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:22.900]  He called me Andrew.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:23.620]  I said, absolutely.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.440]  So I've been Andrew a dozen times.
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.060]  With three different companies.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.340]  The truckers came today and they're like,
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.340]  Hey, what's going on, Andrew?
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.680]  Where are we putting this thing?
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:32.900]  And I'm like, oh, right here in the garage.
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.580]  And they wheel it in.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.940]  They're like, oh, help us move this.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:36.560]  We tilt it.
[01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.300]  We put it in, whatever.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.120]  It's a big thing.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.080]  And they're like, what is this?
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.240]  And I explained it to him.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.620]  And one guy just went, for real?
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.260]  Like, really, really?
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.140]  And I went, yeah.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.760]  And he's like, I don't...
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.280]  I didn't know that that's something like that they were selling or getting rid of.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.620]  And I went, I don't...
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:55.620]  This is it, man.
[01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:56.480]  This is the thing.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.520]  And, uh...
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.100]  You could have made a profit right there.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.480]  We should have set it up and used it.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.320]  Charge people 50 bucks to use it once.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:07.940]  Yep.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.140]  But it's there.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.000]  It's fully intact.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.100]  It's tall as shit.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.400]  But it is on a pallet.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.840]  So, you know, there's six inches or whatever.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.120]  We'll see.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.140]  It's a lot.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.840]  Did we get the other stuff too?
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.780]  I have not seen or received the other thing yet.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.440]  This is the only thing that I've received with that.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.600]  We did get two separate items.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:26.920]  We did.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:28.700]  I'm not really sweating the other thing so much.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.240]  We got two things we can't talk about.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.820]  Yeah, two things we can't talk about.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.080]  But one thing we can talk about is, Eric, while you were intercepting
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.240]  and dealing with that very important package,
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.500]  we teed you up for the ultimate Jack photo story.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.100]  Oh, did you guys not talk about it?
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.860]  We didn't want to talk about it without you because it began with you.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.980]  Boys, this is what a way to end this podcast.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.060]  This is great.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.940]  We were at Geoff's and we're celebrating the drinks are flowing
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:59.300]  and everyone's having such a gay old time regaling each other with stories.
[01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:02.880]  I'm hanging out with Nick Saldana, Jason Saldana.
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.340]  Everyone's there. It's incredible.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.500]  Truck boys are there.
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.320]  Everyone's having a great time.
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:11.740]  And then I see Jack and he comes over and he starts talking to me
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:14.520]  and I'm saying, yes, nice to see you.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.160]  Very good.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.200]  And we talk for a while.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.280]  And then he goes, hey, what kind of bird do you think?
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.500]  Hey, Geoff knows birds, right?
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.180]  And I went, yeah.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.940]  And he's like, what kind of bird do you think this is?
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.100]  And he shows me a picture.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:27.120]  I don't answer him.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.100]  It was like my soul leaped out of my body
[01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:37.700]  trying to get to Geoff as fast as possible to go,
[01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:42.840]  Geoff, Jack has a question about what kind of bird this is.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.280]  Needs a bird identified.
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.500]  He goes, yeah, it's a weird bird.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.080]  I've never seen anything like it before.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.080]  Strange, exotic bird.
[01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.580]  He's never seen anything like it.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.040]  Exotic.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.820]  Then he shows us a picture.
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:56.340]  Shall I post it?
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:56.860]  Yeah.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.720]  Do you have it?
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.520]  Yeah, I have it as a photo.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.720]  Oh my God.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:00.420]  Yes.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:01.980]  I've been waiting for this.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.200]  This is the picture that he shows us of the strange exotic bird.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:07.340]  Check it.
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.180]  If you can't see this picture, you got to look on the YouTube or Patreon feed to see it.
[01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:17.070]  Andrew?
[01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:25.630]  For the audience.
[01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:33.830]  The photo is of the most bog standard pigeon you will ever see in your entire life.
[01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:38.010]  It is like the picture in the Webster's Dictionary of Pigeons.
[01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:44.410]  Well, we make fun of Jack for like 25 minutes.
[01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:46.150]  He got so frustrated so fast.
[01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:50.070]  But Eric was like every single person at the party, Eric, I went,
[01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.190]  Hey, Emily, come here.
[01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.590]  Hey, Jeremy and Megan, come over here.
[01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:56.230]  Jack, show them.
[01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.890]  I went through and Eric was like, oh, Gavin, real quick.
[01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:00.710]  What's this?
[01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.110]  And Jack just shows it to me and I go, pigeon.
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:12.690]  But in fairness to him, it does have a bit of a weird face.
[01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:13.430]  It does.
[01:06:13.590 --> 01:06:16.050]  And he just went, well, it has like such a long neck.
[01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.470]  And I went, okay.
[01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:18.750]  It can't be a pigeon.
[01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:19.650]  Its neck is too long.
[01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:21.430]  I think it's just a jank pigeon.
[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:23.490]  I think it's a pigeon that flew into a window.
[01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:29.350]  He showed us, it's just a party full of people looking at Jack's phone and going,
[01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:30.190]  that's a pigeon.
[01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:35.310]  As he gets more and more upset and then looks at Geoff and he goes, I remember this.
[01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.390]  I felt so bad.
[01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.510]  But you can't just roll up at a party where everybody's having a good time
[01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:48.870]  and then say you've got a picture of an exotic bird you've identified on your phone
[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:50.250]  and then show everybody a crow.
[01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:53.290]  It was, oh my God.
[01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:54.830]  I couldn't stop calling people.
[01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:58.810]  Every time I made half a second of eye contact with someone, I went, you got,
[01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:00.370]  you gotta see this bird.
[01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.610]  Check out this exotic bird.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:07.670]  I would like to officially thank Jack for sending me the picture and allowing us
[01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:09.490]  to retell this story.
[01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:14.750]  For being the best sport in the world and for fucking putting up with us.
[01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:17.550]  For putting up with me for so many years.
[01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:21.250]  I love him so much.
[01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.470]  What kind of bird do you think this is?
[01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:25.570]  Imagine somebody walking up to you at a party.
[01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:28.270]  What kind of bird do you think this is?
[01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:30.390]  The fuck are you talking about?
[01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:31.570]  Hey, you're a bird guy, right?
[01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.050]  I need to get the experts.
[01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:43.230]  Can we, can we just have a shirt with this picture on it?
[01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:48.690]  It's, it's just, it's so crazy how it's just, yeah.
[01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.810]  His face looks a little weird,
[01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:54.270]  but I think it's because of the picture that he took and not the bird.
[01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:57.270]  Can we, can we make a picture?
[01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:00.570]  We put this on a shirt and sell it and it just under it, right?
[01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:01.270]  What bird?
[01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.930]  I googled pigeon because I wanted to see all the pigeons.
[01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.290]  Just to cross reference.
[01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:10.110]  Get on the revenue.
[01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:12.510]  Yeah, we'll split the revenue with them.
[01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:13.050]  We'll split the revenue.
[01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:17.350]  And it just, it immediately, it defaults typical pigeons.
[01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.590]  And it's just that.
[01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.590]  I wonder if it flew into a window, smashed his beak up.
[01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:26.730]  And it's just, it can't eat good.
[01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:29.210]  And that's why it's maybe a bit skinnier than a normal pigeon.
[01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:31.190]  I think its beak is fine.
[01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:33.350]  I think that's just like the coloring above it.
[01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.910]  Yeah.
[01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:38.130]  It's so funny to avoid all of the other indicators.
[01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.950]  Like the typical pigeon has that coloring too.
[01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:43.170]  Just smaller.
[01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.750]  It just looks like a toenail for a beak.
[01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:48.710]  I can't remember the last time I've laughed that hard.
[01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:53.110]  You and every single person at that party.
[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:56.470]  For so long.
[01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.950]  I just, without skipping a beat, said pigeon.
[01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.190]  And then his reaction.
[01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.990]  I almost fell on the floor laughing.
[01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:03.250]  I was like, that was it?
[01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:05.470]  That was the, that was the bird you didn't know?
[01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:13.650]  And just Jack getting more frustrated and annoyed with every person just made it.
[01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:14.730]  It really sealed it.
[01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:16.610]  Is that, that was a top five moment for me.
[01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.590]  Yeah, it was pretty good.
[01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.070]  We should wrap this one up, but boy, that was, oh man.
[01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:22.250]  It's so much excitement on that one.
[01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.990]  I loved it.
[01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.850]  God, I loved it.
[01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:26.530]  Oh, that would, that would make a great thumbnail for this episode,
[01:09:26.610 --> 01:09:30.070]  but I feel like it kind of gives away what would be so different.
[01:09:30.150 --> 01:09:31.250]  Yeah, I'll do something.
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.930]  We do need a thumbnail for the episode though.
[01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.250]  What do we?
[01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:37.610]  Oh, what if it's the, uh, it's this picture, but with the pigeon cut out.
[01:09:37.710 --> 01:09:39.350]  It's just white where the bird is.
[01:09:39.570 --> 01:09:39.830]  Okay.
[01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:42.310]  Who's that Pokemon?
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:42.950]  Yeah.
[01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:47.190]  I saw, I saw a YouTube comment on episode 59.
[01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:51.410]  That was like, I'm not watching this because of how dog shit this thumbnail is.
[01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:57.090]  It was just that picture of Shin Lim with all the cars looking like a lunatic.
[01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.030]  Somebody's like, no, not watching, not listening.
[01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:00.250]  Yeah.
[01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.630]  Really?
[01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:00.890]  Yeah.
[01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.190]  Okay.
[01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:02.090]  Thank you.
[01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:05.650]  I thought Shin Lim as the thumbnail was so funny.
[01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:06.610]  Just terrible.
[01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:11.070]  I love how the internet, the world went from never judge a book by its cover to the internet
[01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.430]  becoming only judge a book by its cover.
[01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.910]  Yep.
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:16.110]  That's it.
[01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.770]  That's great.
[01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.650]  Yep.
[01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.990]  All right.
[01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.730]  We should wrap this one.
[01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.470]  All right.
[01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:23.290]  Well, thank you very much for listening to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:25.230]  We got a bit spaghetti into it.
[01:10:25.290 --> 01:10:26.090]  I apologize for that.
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:26.830]  Didn't mean to.
[01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:32.610]  Probably won't hit the spaghet up next week, but you do want to tune in for episode 62
[01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:36.930]  of The Regulation Podcast next week because we want to talk with you about a product that
[01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.050]  we may or may not be making.
[01:10:38.130 --> 01:10:40.070]  We want to get some, we want to get your feedback on it.
[01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.570]  So we'll probably talk about that kind of early in the podcast.
[01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:46.610]  And I'm sure we'll have a bunch of other dumb stories and stupid things to regale you with.
[01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:48.890]  Thank you for listening.
[01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:50.730]  Regulation out.
[01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:51.570]  Bye.
[01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:52.310]  Bye.
