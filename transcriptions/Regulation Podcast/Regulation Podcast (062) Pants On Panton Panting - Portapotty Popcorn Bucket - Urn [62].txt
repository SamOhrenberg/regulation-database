[00:00.000 --> 00:03.040]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:03.220 --> 00:04.240]  This is number 62.
[00:04.620 --> 00:07.580]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Eric, what?
[00:07.820 --> 00:10.640]  Eric Baudour, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free.
[00:12.180 --> 00:14.180]  Oh, didn't want me to be first.
[00:14.240 --> 00:15.500]  That's fine. I understand. It's OK.
[00:15.580 --> 00:17.240]  No, I just just got a little tongue tied.
[00:17.760 --> 00:20.660]  I'm still I didn't get tongue tied. I got tongue tired.
[00:20.800 --> 00:24.500]  I'm still this is five minutes since the last recording
[00:24.500 --> 00:27.200]  we did where I'm still exhausted from my kerfuffle.
[00:27.700 --> 00:29.580]  The man just saw an exotic bird.
[00:29.580 --> 00:31.940]  He needs to gather himself. Give him a break.
[00:33.800 --> 00:35.780]  Yeah, I'm still flummoxed from the bird.
[00:36.120 --> 00:36.900]  Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[00:37.100 --> 00:40.060]  Did you just look at the photo and go, enhance, enhance?
[00:40.220 --> 00:42.580]  We got to, oh, break this down.
[00:43.160 --> 00:45.720]  Do you feel like your brain gets tired before your body?
[00:46.560 --> 00:50.360]  Well, I feel like my my ability to speak breaks down before my ability to run.
[00:50.840 --> 00:51.600]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[00:52.060 --> 00:54.120]  Yeah, it didn't used to be the case, but yeah, for sure.
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.240]  Are you running a lot?
[00:57.820 --> 00:59.040]  Uh, that's a good point.
[00:59.040 --> 01:02.120]  I mean, not in this weather.
[01:02.900 --> 01:05.820]  Next time you start feeling a little sleepy, maybe like brain tired.
[01:06.420 --> 01:07.360]  Just get up.
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.820]  Just run as fast as you can and then see if maybe it'll wake you up.
[01:12.940 --> 01:15.100]  Maybe it'll kind of equilibrium a little bit.
[01:15.180 --> 01:16.140]  Yeah, then try to have a conversation.
[01:16.300 --> 01:16.880]  See how smart you sound.
[01:17.140 --> 01:19.260]  Yeah, run as fast as you can to Meg.
[01:19.600 --> 01:21.620]  Now I just can't speak, but also I'm panting.
[01:23.660 --> 01:25.360]  I wish I could do stuff in my brain
[01:25.360 --> 01:28.240]  because I find that my eyes get tired first.
[01:29.660 --> 01:32.580]  That like I want to do things, but then my eyes get tired
[01:32.580 --> 01:35.040]  and so I have to close my eyes, but I'm not sleepy,
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.380]  but I don't want to open my eyes because my eyes are tight.
[01:37.920 --> 01:41.840]  Do you ever think about how when you pant, Andrew, you're panting, panting?
[01:42.520 --> 01:42.920]  No.
[01:44.220 --> 01:45.420]  Maybe you will next time.
[01:45.700 --> 01:47.400]  Yeah. Close your eyes and see if you can picture it.
[01:47.840 --> 01:50.180]  I'm picturing it, but that involves me.
[01:50.400 --> 01:51.560]  I'm thinking of pants.
[01:52.020 --> 01:53.660]  What if you were panting with your pants on?
[01:54.020 --> 01:55.820]  Yeah, and that's never happening.
[01:56.280 --> 01:57.560]  Pants on, panting, panting.
[01:59.140 --> 02:01.460]  That was honestly the biggest issue I was thinking about
[02:01.460 --> 02:04.220]  when we're talking about jumping out of the plane and it being cold.
[02:04.820 --> 02:07.280]  I'm not I'm not putting pants on for that.
[02:07.460 --> 02:08.940]  We're going to have to find a short solution.
[02:09.420 --> 02:12.940]  You're going to even with like maybe new technology
[02:12.940 --> 02:15.400]  that would keep you warm at 33,000 feet or whatever.
[02:15.580 --> 02:16.560]  You're still a shorts guy.
[02:17.220 --> 02:19.500]  I think it would have to be a long sock situation
[02:19.500 --> 02:22.080]  because I'm OK with long socks, but I just don't want the pants.
[02:22.560 --> 02:24.160]  Would you wear pants at my funeral?
[02:24.980 --> 02:25.340]  No.
[02:26.480 --> 02:28.480]  What if what if it was this one request?
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.460]  He's dead. Like, I don't.
[02:33.340 --> 02:34.240]  It's a request.
[02:34.500 --> 02:34.780]  I have to.
[02:35.080 --> 02:38.480]  Do you think if you get married someday, you'll you'll wear pants at your wedding?
[02:40.040 --> 02:40.360]  No.
[02:40.960 --> 02:43.240]  Do you when you go to the doctor, do you wear pants?
[02:43.680 --> 02:45.020]  No. Hmm.
[02:45.440 --> 02:47.840]  I feel like the doctor is a pants on situation.
[02:48.000 --> 02:48.560]  I don't know why.
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.440]  It's always hot in Austin.
[02:49.540 --> 02:52.120]  But I will put on a pair of pants to go to the doctor.
[02:52.340 --> 02:53.620]  Nah, shorts. Hmm.
[02:54.220 --> 02:55.440]  Yeah, you gotta get comfy.
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.580]  I don't understand the doctor thing.
[02:58.160 --> 02:58.540]  I don't know why.
[02:58.800 --> 03:01.800]  It's like I just whenever I go anything that this seems important or official,
[03:01.800 --> 03:04.740]  I feel like I need to I can't look like I'm wearing swim trunks.
[03:04.880 --> 03:05.220]  I don't know.
[03:05.320 --> 03:06.260]  Oh, those are fancy.
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.320]  Eric is posting Pharrell in shorts.
[03:08.460 --> 03:09.720]  Those are some fancy shorts.
[03:10.020 --> 03:12.640]  The one that I always think of is LeBron when
[03:13.420 --> 03:17.180]  when I film promos for this for AAPW, the wrestling company.
[03:17.180 --> 03:19.860]  When it's too hot, I'm wearing shorts, but then I put on a suit jacket
[03:19.860 --> 03:22.440]  like the upper half or whatever, and I walk around.
[03:22.440 --> 03:23.520]  I just tell everyone I'm LeBron.
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.460]  The interesting thing about LeBron, though, is that those are actually full size pants.
[03:34.120 --> 03:35.920]  Do you wear hoodies, Andrew?
[03:36.380 --> 03:37.440]  No, I guess not.
[03:37.980 --> 03:39.020]  So you wear T-shirts?
[03:39.600 --> 03:41.740]  T-shirts. Yeah. T-shirt shorts.
[03:42.160 --> 03:44.460]  OK, so do you have a jacket sometimes?
[03:44.840 --> 03:47.160]  I don't know if I own a jacket right now.
[03:47.700 --> 03:49.480]  This is how it's going to be at Gavin's funeral.
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.820]  Gavin, your funeral is going to be Andrew, dressed like that.
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.220]  OK, let's you know, how would you like me to be dressed at your funeral, Gavin?
[03:57.200 --> 03:57.960]  Oh, however you want.
[03:58.540 --> 03:59.940]  You I mean, you won't go, though.
[04:00.860 --> 04:01.620]  Well, no, I would go.
[04:01.980 --> 04:03.660]  Oh, where is it?
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.820]  Why did he say it? He said it.
[04:06.060 --> 04:07.660]  You know, let me reverse.
[04:08.220 --> 04:09.800]  Where is it? Where is it?
[04:09.980 --> 04:10.360]  I'm there.
[04:13.400 --> 04:14.020]  I'm there.
[04:14.500 --> 04:15.220]  Buddy, I'm there.
[04:15.380 --> 04:17.500]  Where does everybody want to have their funeral?
[04:18.000 --> 04:18.880]  Oh, that's a good question.
[04:19.540 --> 04:22.260]  Thirty three thousand feet in the air and everyone has to jump out.
[04:22.440 --> 04:23.420]  OK, there you go.
[04:23.560 --> 04:24.380]  That's how we spread your ashes.
[04:24.760 --> 04:26.260]  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's fine.
[04:27.960 --> 04:30.120]  Yeah. How many ashes do you become?
[04:30.160 --> 04:32.140]  Like how many ash pieces?
[04:32.560 --> 04:33.780]  Oh, like how many?
[04:34.020 --> 04:36.800]  But I mean, like how many pounds of ash do you become?
[04:37.260 --> 04:39.740]  Well, it's good enough.
[04:40.560 --> 04:42.640]  Which one? Fat boy.
[04:44.080 --> 04:45.740]  Four and six pounds.
[04:46.560 --> 04:48.040]  So would that be like a million pieces?
[04:48.900 --> 04:51.600]  Like, I wonder who's been spread the most.
[04:52.200 --> 04:52.780]  It's a good question.
[04:53.060 --> 04:55.620]  Like if you could have one little ash
[04:55.620 --> 04:59.820]  nug of your favorite celebrity, would you have it?
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.700]  No, no.
[05:02.740 --> 05:03.660]  Would you?
[05:04.340 --> 05:04.900]  I don't think so.
[05:07.980 --> 05:09.800]  But having an ash
[05:09.800 --> 05:12.900]  nug is below buying bathwater, I feel like.
[05:13.480 --> 05:17.660]  You wouldn't want like a little it'd be a little ash nug on a piece of tape
[05:18.040 --> 05:18.600]  in a frame.
[05:21.020 --> 05:22.020]  Is it numbered?
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.460]  Is it like a card?
[05:23.620 --> 05:24.720]  Is it like one out of?
[05:25.800 --> 05:29.100]  If you could tell me what part of the celebrity it was,
[05:29.140 --> 05:32.380]  like you got a little piece of his right hand, maybe.
[05:32.980 --> 05:35.620]  I don't know where the where the ash was a part of.
[05:36.060 --> 05:39.560]  OK, then, like if it was the reason they were famous.
[05:40.220 --> 05:41.160]  Oh, interesting.
[05:41.540 --> 05:44.740]  Like if you could have Howard Stern's throat.
[05:45.520 --> 05:47.160]  Yeah. Yeah.
[05:47.980 --> 05:51.060]  Like having Howard Stern's elbow means nothing to me,
[05:51.120 --> 05:53.240]  but having a little bit of Howard Stern's throat. Yeah, sure.
[05:56.880 --> 05:58.040]  This is psychotic.
[05:58.300 --> 05:59.140]  I'm just imagining.
[05:59.940 --> 06:03.680]  Oh, no, I don't like any any of the ideas of like what I would associate
[06:03.680 --> 06:06.620]  Howard Stern with as far as what he's famous for.
[06:06.760 --> 06:11.200]  I assume you're not meant to mail people like ash people.
[06:12.260 --> 06:12.900]  Ash people?
[06:13.500 --> 06:16.720]  Well, it's like, you know, I assume you can't just stick an urn in the mail, can you?
[06:16.720 --> 06:18.060]  No, you definitely can't.
[06:18.480 --> 06:20.180]  You can't. Yeah, you can.
[06:20.300 --> 06:21.200]  You can mail ashes.
[06:22.700 --> 06:25.020]  Oh, oh, you definitely can't.
[06:25.700 --> 06:26.980]  You can't just fucking.
[06:27.200 --> 06:31.460]  You can't get like an envelope and pour them just in it loose.
[06:31.660 --> 06:32.500]  Like, that's what I was thinking.
[06:32.900 --> 06:38.900]  Like, surely if you pour, if you just put one ash nug in an envelope,
[06:39.280 --> 06:40.200]  they it's not.
[06:40.940 --> 06:42.340]  I don't think they'd mind.
[06:42.560 --> 06:43.840]  I don't know how you would.
[06:45.360 --> 06:49.120]  Cremated remains must be shipped using Priority Mail Express
[06:49.120 --> 06:51.260]  or Priority Mail Express International.
[06:52.140 --> 06:53.860]  No other services permitted.
[06:54.700 --> 07:01.660]  Yeah, surprising.
[07:05.380 --> 07:09.660]  That's how I send Andrew his his paychecks every month.
[07:09.940 --> 07:11.260]  It's Priority Mail Express International.
[07:13.040 --> 07:16.300]  So if I wanted to, I could sprinkle some Gavin or somebody in there.
[07:16.380 --> 07:17.080]  It'd be totally fine.
[07:17.520 --> 07:18.580]  Well, that's what I was thinking.
[07:18.700 --> 07:21.120]  Maybe you've already mailed someone that you just didn't know.
[07:21.280 --> 07:23.660]  Like if they were just caught on the wind when you were sealing up an envelope.
[07:24.000 --> 07:24.760]  Caught on the wind.
[07:25.360 --> 07:27.340]  Well, if people are scattering stuff into the air.
[07:29.100 --> 07:31.580]  Well, that could let a piece of person land on you at some point.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.620]  Then that means you probably have breathed the person at some point.
[07:34.780 --> 07:36.040]  Yeah, it's just carbon.
[07:36.200 --> 07:37.400]  Have I ever breathed the person?
[07:37.480 --> 07:38.520]  I don't think I have.
[07:39.160 --> 07:39.720]  You wouldn't know.
[07:40.700 --> 07:42.220]  No, but I'm trying to think of scenarios.
[07:42.580 --> 07:46.180]  I mean, you're trying to think of like if you've been Lebowski'd.
[07:46.700 --> 07:50.760]  I definitely would know if I've been Lebowski'd, but I'm just trying to think of like,
[07:50.960 --> 07:53.680]  I feel like when you get ashes, they're pretty secure.
[07:54.100 --> 07:56.280]  And I've never been around an open urn.
[07:57.320 --> 07:59.120]  So the particles are everywhere.
[07:59.780 --> 08:03.560]  I told you guys that story about how my mom Lebowski'd that family with my dad, right?
[08:04.580 --> 08:08.600]  It sounds vaguely familiar, but the fact that I don't immediately know makes me feel like you know.
[08:09.580 --> 08:10.800]  Fucking brutal, dude.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.100]  My dad, we have my dad's ashes.
[08:13.620 --> 08:14.260]  God damn.
[08:14.780 --> 08:16.060]  And he loved the ocean.
[08:16.300 --> 08:16.960]  He loved the beach.
[08:17.240 --> 08:20.000]  And so my mom was like, I want to take and spread his ashes.
[08:20.720 --> 08:21.480]  Oh, no.
[08:21.720 --> 08:23.320]  I think I was at Gulf Shores, maybe.
[08:23.660 --> 08:25.660]  She's like, I want to take and spread his ashes off the pier.
[08:26.260 --> 08:29.860]  And then you get up there and there's signs that are like, you can't do this.
[08:30.060 --> 08:30.720]  You need a permit.
[08:31.320 --> 08:32.900]  And it was like we were like, oh, fuck.
[08:33.200 --> 08:35.320]  And so I guess it's something that happens a lot.
[08:35.460 --> 08:36.580]  We started reading about it on my phone.
[08:36.660 --> 08:37.560]  They're like, yeah, it's hyper illegal.
[08:38.480 --> 08:40.660]  And so you got to have like a permit or something to do it.
[08:40.700 --> 08:41.540]  And my mom goes, we're not.
[08:41.800 --> 08:42.460]  I don't want to do that.
[08:42.460 --> 08:44.220]  Let's just let's just do it where nobody will see.
[08:44.680 --> 08:48.020]  So instead of throwing him off the edge of the pier, she's like,
[08:48.020 --> 08:49.420]  we'll just go under the pier.
[08:49.640 --> 08:51.140]  And so we go under the pier.
[08:51.440 --> 08:54.080]  And my mom just walks out to the water, like rolls her legs up.
[08:54.160 --> 08:56.040]  She walks out into the water a little bit and she just takes the box
[08:56.040 --> 08:57.080]  and like throws it in the air.
[08:57.580 --> 08:59.960]  And like my grandma was there and she's upset.
[09:00.440 --> 09:01.840]  You know, a little bummed.
[09:01.920 --> 09:03.920]  And, you know, my mom's slinging ashes.
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.840]  And as she does it, we hear, oh, and I look over
[09:08.840 --> 09:12.120]  and there's a family walking in the water towards us
[09:12.120 --> 09:15.700]  like a mom and a dad and the dad's holding a kid in his arm.
[09:16.100 --> 09:18.120]  And the mom is like holding another kid's hand.
[09:18.240 --> 09:21.280]  And they see it coming and they just all huddle together
[09:21.280 --> 09:25.500]  and they like shield the kid and they got dusted by my dad.
[09:25.760 --> 09:27.860]  And about maybe 15 feet to the right of us.
[09:27.940 --> 09:29.120]  And we just booked it out of there.
[09:29.600 --> 09:30.780]  Oh, my God.
[09:30.940 --> 09:32.260]  We just booked it the fuck out of there.
[09:32.660 --> 09:34.820]  Well, you know, he left the water. He left families.
[09:35.100 --> 09:36.820]  Yeah, he's a big family man. So, yeah.
[09:38.100 --> 09:39.640]  Oh, oh, my God.
[09:39.640 --> 09:41.300]  She fly tipped your dad.
[09:44.960 --> 09:47.340]  Ironically, that's probably the best thing my dad could have asked for.
[09:47.500 --> 09:50.300]  Like, if he thought that was an option, he would have chosen that.
[09:50.880 --> 09:52.740]  My dad was a, you know, he was a prankster, though.
[09:52.940 --> 09:56.020]  But he had a sense of humor.
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.320]  Everything he wanted.
[09:57.520 --> 09:59.360]  Has anyone been buried as ashes?
[10:00.580 --> 10:03.660]  Get cremated. Pour all the ashes in the coffin.
[10:04.100 --> 10:05.720]  And then in the coffin burial.
[10:07.340 --> 10:08.180]  Best of both worlds.
[10:08.660 --> 10:10.480]  Best of both worlds.
[10:11.100 --> 10:12.620]  Probably just vampires.
[10:13.460 --> 10:15.360]  Oh, man. Yeah, that's a good call.
[10:15.940 --> 10:20.660]  I just I can't imagine an open casket where the person's been cremated ahead of time.
[10:21.220 --> 10:23.960]  I think what I want, take my head off, right?
[10:25.180 --> 10:26.980]  Just get all the flesh out.
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.080]  Cremate the rest of me. Put it in the skull.
[10:30.580 --> 10:31.760]  I'll be my own urn.
[10:32.580 --> 10:33.760]  Oh, wow. Wow.
[10:34.400 --> 10:35.600]  I don't want your...
[10:36.520 --> 10:39.100]  What about like your, your eye hole sockets and stuff?
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.280]  Yeah, it wouldn't hold.
[10:40.280 --> 10:43.980]  Does any, do you think any or you're not, do you think anything is going to leak out?
[10:44.260 --> 10:47.280]  Well, I think a raccoon could a raccoon could just come and eat those.
[10:47.340 --> 10:48.760]  Right. So that shouldn't be a problem.
[10:49.100 --> 10:51.040]  Why would a raccoon have access to my skull?
[10:51.380 --> 10:53.280]  I don't know. It just figures like Geoff's serial killer.
[10:53.360 --> 10:55.200]  Like it would just come in, eat your brains, eat your eyes,
[10:55.200 --> 10:57.160]  and then like leave you for your ashes.
[10:57.500 --> 10:59.020]  Why would it have access to your skull?
[10:59.040 --> 11:01.520]  Because it's hanging out in your attic with all the squirrels and snakes.
[11:01.820 --> 11:03.020]  Yeah, that's true. Yeah, you're full.
[11:03.100 --> 11:04.420]  It's full of squirrels and snakes now.
[11:04.920 --> 11:06.940]  Yeah, I had a snake.
[11:08.460 --> 11:10.080]  I can't come, I can't come back to your house.
[11:10.600 --> 11:12.260]  Wait, what? I can't come back to your house.
[11:12.980 --> 11:13.880]  I can't come back to your house.
[11:14.020 --> 11:16.040]  I can't believe it happened after Geoff brought it up, too.
[11:16.140 --> 11:17.080]  I couldn't believe it.
[11:17.140 --> 11:19.380]  You sent that video and I just went, well, you shouldn't have done that.
[11:19.520 --> 11:23.380]  I swear in a recent podcast, I said that I rarely see snakes,
[11:23.380 --> 11:24.780]  but I did just see one.
[11:24.820 --> 11:26.700]  So I'm probably not going to see one for another 10 years.
[11:26.800 --> 11:28.960]  Yeah, you did. It was like the next day.
[11:29.520 --> 11:31.840]  It was in my snake follows thing I was talking about.
[11:32.360 --> 11:36.680]  Yeah, I can't post this public because it's literally on the front of my house.
[11:37.060 --> 11:38.920]  I can show you a lot.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.100]  Oh, I need nitro.
[11:41.240 --> 11:43.780]  Put it in Slack. Put it in Slack.
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.900]  It freaked Geoff out.
[11:47.540 --> 11:48.560]  Geoff was not happy.
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.880]  It was right after Geoff had talked about how he'd seen a snake.
[11:52.540 --> 11:55.500]  I know. I was talking about how I realized that I'm every day
[11:55.500 --> 11:59.280]  I'm getting closer to seeing a snake in person and that, you know,
[11:59.280 --> 12:02.400]  every decision I and the snake or its parents
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.160]  make is putting us closer to to intersecting.
[12:05.300 --> 12:06.700]  And I'm not jazzed about that.
[12:06.860 --> 12:08.680]  OK, so we got a snake situation.
[12:08.860 --> 12:10.420]  It's oh, it's climbing up.
[12:10.540 --> 12:13.100]  It's big. That is an intimidating snake.
[12:13.560 --> 12:14.880]  How many feet do you think that snake is?
[12:14.920 --> 12:16.620]  Three feet, four feet? Probably. Yeah.
[12:16.620 --> 12:17.640]  And 11 feet.
[12:17.820 --> 12:19.760]  And it and it crawled.
[12:19.800 --> 12:23.180]  It crawled up the side of the house and then I lost track of it.
[12:24.000 --> 12:25.000]  But it didn't lose track.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.280]  I don't like losing track of that.
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.320]  Why? What do you mean lost track?
[12:28.320 --> 12:30.680]  Just get up in that attic with the squirrels and go have a look.
[12:30.920 --> 12:31.480]  And he's up there.
[12:31.820 --> 12:35.820]  Probably is after them. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
[12:36.320 --> 12:40.040]  Yeah. Or like I was telling you, it's just going home from work
[12:40.040 --> 12:41.640]  after a long day of snake job.
[12:41.740 --> 12:44.920]  And it just wants to fucking chill in front of snake TV with its wife
[12:44.920 --> 12:48.080]  and kids in your attic where it lives in its snake community
[12:48.080 --> 12:51.160]  with all the other snakes that are right above your head at all times.
[12:51.260 --> 12:54.080]  You think I was just hearing the snakes the whole time? Oh, God.
[12:54.640 --> 12:57.140]  Well, I think you heard the snakes eating the squirrels the whole time.
[12:57.580 --> 12:59.500]  I got I got pest control coming today.
[12:59.920 --> 13:01.400]  Thank you, God. Oh, my God.
[13:01.440 --> 13:03.020]  Did you let them know that it's snakes?
[13:04.940 --> 13:05.680]  Oh, boy.
[13:06.040 --> 13:08.500]  Well, that wasn't in my original email because it hadn't happened yet.
[13:09.820 --> 13:12.080]  Oh, probably. Probably let the guy know.
[13:12.160 --> 13:12.960]  So he knows what he's getting into.
[13:13.400 --> 13:14.080]  What about the squirrel?
[13:14.280 --> 13:15.920]  Did they take care of the squirrels?
[13:16.500 --> 13:17.660]  The people haven't come yet.
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.240]  They haven't. Do you still have them?
[13:21.060 --> 13:22.860]  Well, he has a snake now, dude.
[13:22.860 --> 13:24.220]  It's coming after his squirrels.
[13:24.280 --> 13:26.240]  Yeah. You send in a spider to get the fly.
[13:26.240 --> 13:27.040]  Maybe he'll die.
[13:27.400 --> 13:30.920]  Pretty soon, there's going to be a gorilla climbing up there to eat the hyena
[13:30.920 --> 13:34.740]  that was there to eat the fucking snake that's there to eat the squirrels.
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.420]  Gavin's house is just slowly turning into an ark.
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.700]  It's just going to be every animal is going to exist.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.380]  And there's going to be one of every animal skeleton.
[13:43.380 --> 13:45.580]  And then the largest animal will be alive.
[13:46.060 --> 13:49.880]  I'm imagining your cremated skeleton skull thing.
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.360]  Not skeleton, just a skull.
[13:51.620 --> 13:52.740]  Skull. Skull. Skull.
[13:53.020 --> 13:54.460]  What did I add? Another one.
[13:54.460 --> 13:57.320]  Anyway, I, I would only be OK with it
[13:57.320 --> 14:00.140]  if you put these googly eyes where the eye sockets are.
[14:00.320 --> 14:01.600]  I'm greatly disturbed.
[14:01.840 --> 14:06.780]  But then when I imagine seeing that, but those little googly sticker eyes,
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.360]  I would be OK with it.
[14:09.080 --> 14:10.800]  Well, the skull would have to be upside down, surely.
[14:11.420 --> 14:13.880]  I think you just have to seal it somehow.
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.100]  Seal my under face?
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.980]  Maybe it's in like a...
[14:20.980 --> 14:21.760]  under skull?
[14:22.580 --> 14:23.900]  I don't know what that's called.
[14:25.220 --> 14:28.260]  Searching for googly eyes on a human skull does not produce that,
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.520]  but it does produce a lot of other really weird things.
[14:30.740 --> 14:31.420]  I'm sure.
[14:32.940 --> 14:33.660]  Oh, interesting.
[14:34.260 --> 14:37.540]  So you have pest control coming for the snake or is it unrelated?
[14:38.140 --> 14:39.040]  For the squirrels.
[14:39.160 --> 14:40.180]  The squirrels.
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.860]  Yeah. So they're coming today for the squirrels.
[14:42.940 --> 14:44.720]  For whatever's in my ceiling.
[14:45.340 --> 14:47.240]  Yeah, they're coming today for the squirrels,
[14:47.240 --> 14:49.460]  but they're going to be really excited when they see it's full of snakes.
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.820]  Yeah. What are you going to do with it?
[14:51.900 --> 14:53.360]  Like, could I have got a snake down?
[14:53.360 --> 14:55.700]  I think it would have tried to choke me.
[14:55.760 --> 14:56.720]  No, you leave the snake.
[14:57.360 --> 15:00.820]  If there's a snake climbing up my house, I'm getting it off my fucking house.
[15:00.900 --> 15:02.940]  I'm spraying it with a hose until it gets off.
[15:03.180 --> 15:06.080]  You think the snake would have tried to choke you?
[15:07.240 --> 15:08.620]  Yeah, locking that rear naked.
[15:08.840 --> 15:10.480]  Well, I assume it's a constricting snake.
[15:10.800 --> 15:12.980]  I also think that it would try to choke him or eat him.
[15:13.100 --> 15:15.000]  Yeah. Like, how big does a snake...
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.240]  I'm sure a four foot snake could choke me out.
[15:18.040 --> 15:19.740]  Yeah, I don't think it's going to try.
[15:19.740 --> 15:21.100]  I don't think that's the intent, though.
[15:21.100 --> 15:23.760]  No, I don't. I don't think that's what the snake does.
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.660]  It wants to bite a hole and then crawl into you like a tauntaun and then stab you.
[15:29.720 --> 15:31.880]  It still constricts me, but from...
[15:31.880 --> 15:32.680]  Oh, what?
[15:32.900 --> 15:33.860]  It constricts me from the inside.
[15:33.960 --> 15:35.680]  It just goes in and squeezes my heart.
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.300]  It's like Keanu Reeves in the second Matrix movie.
[15:39.460 --> 15:42.980]  Now, that would be the greatest betrayal of all for Geoff.
[15:43.620 --> 15:46.360]  If Gavin got replaced by a snake and we've been doing a podcast
[15:46.360 --> 15:48.880]  with Gavin Snake for the past however many episodes.
[15:48.940 --> 15:50.160]  I would be so...
[15:50.160 --> 15:51.160]  Send us a picture of your tongue.
[15:51.900 --> 15:53.020]  Let me turn it to you.
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.520]  It's like the thing, but just tongue checks.
[15:59.100 --> 16:00.420]  Stick the tongue out.
[16:01.140 --> 16:02.240]  It's like the thing that...
[16:02.240 --> 16:03.200]  You're not a snake man.
[16:03.480 --> 16:03.720]  Good.
[16:07.040 --> 16:09.660]  Making making everyone do it through like a nest camera
[16:09.660 --> 16:11.020]  before they're allowed in your house.
[16:11.520 --> 16:13.820]  Do you remember when I bought us a bunch of tongue sleeves?
[16:13.880 --> 16:14.640]  What was that for?
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Oh, that's a bit barrel thing.
[16:17.080 --> 16:18.260]  And I also don't know where they are.
[16:18.380 --> 16:19.120]  I don't know what happened to them.
[16:19.120 --> 16:19.900]  I have to buy more.
[16:20.360 --> 16:22.160]  We're going to eat stuff without tasting it.
[16:22.420 --> 16:23.140]  I don't remember.
[16:23.600 --> 16:24.780]  Oh, that was what it was.
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.480]  We were going to see what it would be like if our finger buds were on our hands.
[16:27.640 --> 16:30.720]  So we were going to put put whatever it was inside the tongue sleeve.
[16:30.920 --> 16:33.500]  And then that would be how maybe that was right.
[16:34.280 --> 16:36.300]  We'll throw it in the bit barrel and then the audience will tell us.
[16:36.380 --> 16:39.880]  Or maybe we could put garlic on our feet and lick stuff with the tongue sleeve
[16:39.880 --> 16:41.260]  and see if it really tastes like garlic.
[16:42.060 --> 16:43.580]  Spin around in a circle three times.
[16:43.880 --> 16:44.380]  Yeah, it's good.

[18:17.540 --> 18:22.820]  Speaking of, uh, I don't know, speaking of fucking changing the subject.
[18:23.380 --> 18:27.120]  Uh, I promoted this at the end of the last episode.
[18:27.300 --> 18:32.220]  A couple of weeks ago now in real time, maybe four or five episodes ago,
[18:32.220 --> 18:35.920]  we discussed what a regulation popcorn bucket would be.
[18:36.080 --> 18:38.700]  And then we decided it would be funny if we made a porta putty.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.760]  Porta putty? Porta putty.
[18:41.120 --> 18:42.860]  My brain, my brain's too tired.
[18:42.960 --> 18:45.000]  It's more, I could probably run really fast right now,
[18:45.060 --> 18:46.220]  but unfortunately I can't talk shit.
[18:46.620 --> 18:48.120]  Hit the pavement.
[18:49.140 --> 18:52.360]  We talked about making a porta potty popcorn bucket,
[18:52.460 --> 18:53.400]  which we all thought was hilarious.
[18:53.420 --> 18:57.360]  And then we, we talked to Natalie and we set them in motion
[18:57.880 --> 18:59.780]  just to see if it's feasible.
[19:00.460 --> 19:04.700]  And they came back with an eight inch, which is about the standard size,
[19:04.880 --> 19:07.880]  porta potty pop-up, what? Popcorn bucket.
[19:08.140 --> 19:11.740]  God, dude, hand off the baton. What are you doing?
[19:12.180 --> 19:18.180]  And we want to see if the audience is actually interested in it.
[19:18.500 --> 19:21.300]  If this is the thing that we should actually pursue,
[19:21.320 --> 19:24.960]  or if this is one of those ideas that's funny to talk about,
[19:24.960 --> 19:26.040]  but not actually make.
[19:26.080 --> 19:28.760]  This thing would probably cost in the neighborhood of $30 to $35.
[19:29.460 --> 19:30.940]  I've put some images up.
[19:31.600 --> 19:33.780]  I've actually put the same image up twice somehow,
[19:34.640 --> 19:35.700]  in our Discord.
[19:35.920 --> 19:38.560]  Of the porber puppy? Oh man.
[19:38.960 --> 19:39.640]  Of the porber puppy.
[19:40.460 --> 19:45.700]  Is this something that you as an audience would buy genuinely?
[19:46.380 --> 19:50.260]  Because it would, we would probably have to make at least a thousand of them,
[19:50.520 --> 19:55.120]  which seems like a lot to make, but the porta potty is pink.
[19:55.260 --> 19:56.180]  The top comes off.
[19:56.180 --> 19:57.520]  You can fill it with popcorn.
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.260]  Inside the porta potty is a normal toilet.
[20:00.440 --> 20:04.560]  Not a porta potty toilet, but a small normal toilet that opens up
[20:04.560 --> 20:07.480]  and can hold one popcorn kernel, like Gavin requested.
[20:07.720 --> 20:11.200]  On the top of the popcorn lid, or on the top of the toilet lid,
[20:11.260 --> 20:13.200]  would be the Regulation butthole logo.
[20:13.840 --> 20:18.000]  Is this something you as a customer, as a Regulation listener or a comment leaver,
[20:18.500 --> 20:20.280]  I guess we'll never know for the Regulation listeners,
[20:20.360 --> 20:21.580]  so it's only to the comment leavers.
[20:22.300 --> 20:24.380]  Will you buy this? Should we make this?
[20:24.380 --> 20:26.620]  Is this something you actually want to own?
[20:26.760 --> 20:29.220]  Or is this a bad idea like the Slopper Clock Clock
[20:29.220 --> 20:31.520]  that we're going to have to figure out how to get rid of 1200 of?
[20:31.820 --> 20:33.420]  I mean, it's obviously a bad idea.
[20:33.500 --> 20:36.260]  It's just a popcorn bucket that's horrifically difficult to clean.
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.060]  I would definitely get one though.
[20:38.640 --> 20:40.600]  Yeah, I showed it to Bernie and Vanessa and they were like,
[20:40.720 --> 20:41.980]  I'd pay 40 bucks for that tomorrow.
[20:42.280 --> 20:45.600]  So I was like, I was thinking like, maybe not.
[20:45.640 --> 20:46.600]  Like, maybe we don't do this.
[20:46.660 --> 20:47.820]  Maybe it's like, it's dumb.
[20:47.980 --> 20:49.520]  And then Bernie and Vanessa were like, I was like,
[20:49.520 --> 20:50.100]  what are you guys thinking?
[20:50.180 --> 20:50.980]  They're like, I want one yesterday.
[20:51.160 --> 20:52.220]  And I was like, seriously?
[20:52.380 --> 20:53.260]  And they're like, yeah, I would pay.
[20:53.360 --> 20:54.240]  I would pay good money for that.
[20:54.240 --> 20:54.720]  Tomorrow.
[20:54.940 --> 20:56.200]  I think it's just a cool prop.
[20:56.360 --> 20:57.080]  Like, you wouldn't have to use it.
[20:57.120 --> 20:58.440]  Yeah, I'm looking at it.
[20:58.520 --> 21:00.220]  I'm thinking that that would be a great earn.
[21:00.900 --> 21:01.800]  I think that's where I'm going.
[21:02.100 --> 21:04.500]  Oh, popcorn bucket slash earn!
[21:05.040 --> 21:06.100]  Yeah, lock me in.
[21:06.100 --> 21:07.840]  Shouldn't we sell it as a slash earn?
[21:07.980 --> 21:10.820]  Is there some sort of tax break we can get from being an earn?
[21:12.180 --> 21:14.380]  Can you sell an earn?
[21:15.660 --> 21:16.640]  I don't think...
[21:16.640 --> 21:21.300]  I don't think typically earns are sold as also edible like things.
[21:21.480 --> 21:22.700]  Well, it's whatever you want it to be.
[21:22.780 --> 21:23.740]  Things that store edible food.
[21:23.740 --> 21:26.920]  You decide when you first use it what it's going to be used for.
[21:26.920 --> 21:28.280]  I guess any container can be an earn.
[21:28.840 --> 21:29.860]  Yeah, even a Folgers can.
[21:30.020 --> 21:36.300]  I feel like that'd be such like if there was a new Elvira movie at Alamo, it'd be an earn popcorn bucket.
[21:38.820 --> 21:39.460]  That's really...
[21:39.460 --> 21:42.440]  I didn't think about putting ashes in it, but I guess you could.
[21:42.580 --> 21:44.580]  And then you could just put the top on and never take it off.
[21:44.640 --> 21:47.360]  Or take it off and talk with your loved one?
[21:47.460 --> 21:47.980]  I'm not really sure.
[21:47.980 --> 21:56.320]  I was thinking about like the worst chase thing would be like one Gerpler was filled with ash.
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.240]  With ashes.
[21:57.860 --> 21:59.600]  Like a popcorn bucket where there's one.
[21:59.920 --> 22:05.960]  In Gavin's philosophy or like his great ash kernel or whatever, there's one in the toilet.
[22:06.420 --> 22:09.300]  Gotta check your toilet to see if you got a singular ash piece.
[22:09.840 --> 22:13.600]  There's just like a little piece of bone that didn't quite get burned.
[22:15.720 --> 22:16.280]  Nasty.
[22:17.700 --> 22:21.420]  Well, let us know in the comments if this is something that seems like something you would want.
[22:22.300 --> 22:24.300]  I actually have something I wanted to bring up.
[22:24.580 --> 22:28.720]  And this was pitched to me by our friend Alyssa.
[22:29.220 --> 22:32.180]  And I've been kind of sitting on it, but I think it's a good idea.
[22:32.400 --> 22:34.060]  And it's something I want to explore.
[22:34.220 --> 22:35.820]  I just don't know how to explore it.
[22:37.340 --> 22:43.600]  I feel like we're sometimes in outdoors podcasts, especially when Geoff is on a bike, seeing a snake, being afraid of a snake.
[22:43.600 --> 22:46.040]  But you have to do that when you're out in public, right?
[22:46.040 --> 22:47.920]  You gotta be in these public areas.
[22:48.000 --> 22:49.960]  And sometimes you get too tired.
[22:50.100 --> 22:51.100]  Sometimes you get too hot.
[22:51.220 --> 22:52.520]  Sometimes you just need to have a seat.
[22:53.340 --> 22:58.640]  What was pitched to me, and I think we should do, is we should do commemorative benches.
[22:59.880 --> 23:03.320]  We should get commemorative benches around the United States.
[23:03.760 --> 23:07.940]  So that way everyone knows, have a regulation seat in the park.
[23:08.500 --> 23:10.700]  And just kind of hang out.
[23:10.740 --> 23:11.940]  There's a bunch of different kinds.
[23:12.380 --> 23:14.080]  I think we have to talk to different cities.
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.400]  But imagine that the second picture that I sent is a dog.
[23:18.620 --> 23:23.300]  And he's hanging out on a memorial bench with a bunch of memorial things on it.
[23:24.120 --> 23:28.380]  Some of these are just bench sponsorships and not dedicated to people who died.
[23:28.480 --> 23:31.420]  Which I'm sure a lot of people think that's what it is normally.
[23:31.880 --> 23:34.660]  So just a regulation bench.
[23:34.800 --> 23:35.540]  I think it's great.
[23:35.740 --> 23:39.960]  I think we should try and put 50 regulation benches down in America.
[23:40.140 --> 23:40.800]  One in each state.
[23:41.240 --> 23:43.500]  And the challenge is to sit on each one.
[23:43.500 --> 23:47.460]  I think we gotta have a regulation bench in every state.
[23:47.580 --> 23:50.760]  And we have to physically sit on it and do a podcast from it.
[23:51.080 --> 23:52.740]  Could the first one be a deputy?
[23:53.300 --> 23:56.520]  Well, that's sort of where my mind is going with this.
[23:56.840 --> 23:57.280]  Right, right.
[23:57.300 --> 24:02.120]  But I just don't know if deputy has any parks or benches or people that sit.
[24:02.300 --> 24:03.380]  That's a struggle for sure.
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.340]  Remove deputy.
[24:05.800 --> 24:06.300]  What if...
[24:06.860 --> 24:10.600]  Because there's one bench in this photo that you're listing that has multiple things on it.
[24:10.600 --> 24:18.040]  If we lock down a bench and then whoever wins Faceoff gets to put a thing on that bench.
[24:18.400 --> 24:22.300]  And it's like the Stanley Cup where the team gets engraved onto the thing.
[24:22.400 --> 24:27.160]  But the prize every season is you get to add an engravement of your choice to the bench.
[24:27.780 --> 24:33.620]  So like our trophy each year is just a plaque on the bench that people can sit on.
[24:33.960 --> 24:36.320]  And every year we'll put a new plaque on for the winners?
[24:36.720 --> 24:37.040]  Yes.
[24:37.320 --> 24:39.700]  The winner gets to pick what the plaque is for that bench.
[24:39.700 --> 24:42.360]  And we just keep adding as we do seasons.
[24:43.080 --> 24:45.240]  I also think we can absolutely do the bench and deputy.
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.620]  I think we go to Home Depot and when we buy a bench we put the plaque on ourselves and we just drop it somewhere in Deputy, Indiana.
[24:50.820 --> 24:53.780]  We do the podcast then we leave it and we see if it stays.
[24:54.420 --> 25:00.440]  I like everything about everybody's idea and I think this is perfect because we pitched an idea a while back called Hide and Speak.
[25:00.620 --> 25:04.500]  Where we do podcasts in public where people can't see us. Remember?
[25:05.220 --> 25:13.360]  Kind of like what we did with the Halo video with Gavin's Halo video where he showed us where he would hide and hit on girls.
[25:14.180 --> 25:16.420]  While people were playing Halo. It's one girl.
[25:16.740 --> 25:18.120]  It's kind of like that.
[25:18.700 --> 25:20.220]  It's an old idea. It's on the sheets idea.
[25:20.300 --> 25:23.880]  But anyway, I love this idea because I've been wanting to do podcasts outside anyway.
[25:24.100 --> 25:27.560]  I love the idea of commemorating.
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.900]  I like to sit.
[25:29.420 --> 25:30.000]  I'm a big sitter.
[25:30.440 --> 25:31.320]  I think this is awesome.
[25:31.420 --> 25:32.480]  That is not a comfortable bench.
[25:32.480 --> 25:38.760]  No, but it does say class of 1973 quote don't stop thinking about tomorrow Fleetwood Mac.
[25:38.880 --> 25:41.400]  So we can get whatever we want on a bench apparently.
[25:41.660 --> 25:44.280]  Do you guys want to hear a somber bench dedication story?
[25:45.160 --> 25:46.180]  I guess.
[25:46.700 --> 25:49.080]  If it's too dark we can cut it from the episode.
[25:49.500 --> 25:49.800]  Okay.
[25:50.880 --> 25:52.320]  Couple years ago.
[25:53.100 --> 25:55.220]  Couple years ago in Austin.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.400]  At Millie's pediatrician office.
[25:59.400 --> 26:02.260]  A guy came in.
[26:03.140 --> 26:03.800]  You know what?
[26:04.820 --> 26:05.800]  I'm not going to tell this story.
[26:06.460 --> 26:07.960]  Yeah, we should cut that part out.
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.720]  As soon as you started saying it, I went yeah, we shouldn't include this.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.300]  Yeah, never mind. I'm not going to tell this story.
[26:12.740 --> 26:14.760]  Why don't we put it on Patreon if you want to be bummed out.
[26:15.380 --> 26:15.440]  Alright.
[26:16.080 --> 26:16.400]  Okay.
[26:17.040 --> 26:20.360]  You can leave out the beginning part maybe.
[26:22.520 --> 26:23.540]  I feel like it's integral.
[26:24.060 --> 26:24.880]  It is kind of integral.
[26:24.880 --> 26:29.900]  A guy who was mentally ill.
[26:30.360 --> 26:32.480]  Went into a pediatrician's office in Austin.
[26:32.940 --> 26:33.900]  And took them hostage.
[26:34.200 --> 26:35.660]  The doctors that worked there.
[26:36.020 --> 26:37.660]  An all-woman pediatrician's office.
[26:38.020 --> 26:39.900]  And then he ended up killing one of them.
[26:39.960 --> 26:40.700]  And then committing suicide.
[26:41.280 --> 26:43.520]  It was Millie's pediatrician's office.
[26:43.600 --> 26:44.580]  But not her pediatrician.
[26:44.700 --> 26:45.900]  Anyway, it was a big deal in Austin.
[26:46.000 --> 26:46.540]  It was heartbreaking.
[26:47.040 --> 26:47.920]  It was really sad.
[26:48.060 --> 26:49.740]  It was terrible in every way.
[26:49.920 --> 26:52.120]  And then Emily and I were in San Francisco.
[26:53.800 --> 26:54.520]  For something.
[26:54.660 --> 26:55.360]  I don't even remember what.
[26:55.500 --> 26:56.340]  This was like two years later.
[26:56.480 --> 26:57.380]  And we went to a park.
[26:57.700 --> 26:59.800]  And we sat down at a bench to look at the view.
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.600]  And the bench was dedicated to the doctor who got killed.
[27:02.840 --> 27:03.520]  In Austin.
[27:03.980 --> 27:07.220]  No, her brother lived in San Francisco.
[27:07.340 --> 27:08.660]  And wanted to do something to commemorate her.
[27:08.740 --> 27:10.280]  So he bought the bench and commemorated her for her.
[27:10.400 --> 27:13.780]  And it was just wild that two years later we sat on a random bench.
[27:14.220 --> 27:15.340]  On the other side of the country.
[27:15.340 --> 27:17.040]  And it happened to be dedicated to this person.
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.700]  I don't think I've ever been as out on a story in the first half.
[27:20.700 --> 27:22.300]  And then as in the second half, Geoff.
[27:22.320 --> 27:23.020]  That was impressive.
[27:23.460 --> 27:25.140]  When you started that, I was like.
[27:25.520 --> 27:28.260]  What world is this a good story to share?
[27:28.380 --> 27:29.520]  And you really pulled me in.
[27:29.640 --> 27:30.700]  That's a crazy coincidence.
[27:31.280 --> 27:33.000]  Yeah, it was just one of those things where you're like.
[27:33.040 --> 27:35.980]  How is that possible that we sat on this particular bench.
[27:36.040 --> 27:36.960]  Out of all the benches.
[27:37.680 --> 27:38.820]  Even in this park.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.380]  Let alone in the city of San Francisco.
[27:40.600 --> 27:41.440]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[27:41.760 --> 27:42.400]  That's wild.
[27:44.600 --> 27:48.120]  I have had an interesting life change.
[27:48.120 --> 27:49.100]  With Pillow Mountain.
[27:49.680 --> 27:50.400]  I've expanded.
[27:51.540 --> 27:53.520]  We've got a whole new layer of Pillow Mountain.
[27:53.980 --> 27:54.880]  You got nine pillows now?
[27:55.340 --> 27:56.860]  No, it's not about height.
[27:58.180 --> 27:59.200]  It's a whole new layer.
[28:00.040 --> 28:01.740]  Did you get king size pillows or something?
[28:01.780 --> 28:02.340]  Are you going wider?
[28:02.580 --> 28:04.600]  No, I already have a few of those.
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.260]  What I'm doing is I'm burrowing into the mountain now.
[28:09.820 --> 28:10.820]  We got a whole new game.
[28:10.940 --> 28:11.960]  What do you mean?
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.120]  I used to be someone.
[28:15.200 --> 28:17.340]  Who didn't like sleeping with a blanket.
[28:17.340 --> 28:19.260]  Or anything over their face.
[28:19.380 --> 28:20.680]  The air would get hot.
[28:21.020 --> 28:21.760]  It was unpleasant.
[28:22.020 --> 28:23.700]  You don't put the blanket over your face?
[28:24.020 --> 28:25.820]  Who sleeps with a blanket over their face?
[28:26.860 --> 28:28.920]  If you're laying under the blankets.
[28:29.160 --> 28:30.860]  And it's a blanket fort situation.
[28:32.220 --> 28:34.900]  I'm not wrapping a blanket around my face.
[28:35.000 --> 28:35.700]  And then trying to sleep.
[28:35.860 --> 28:37.120]  But if you're underneath sheets.
[28:37.140 --> 28:38.860]  Yeah, why would you think that?
[28:38.960 --> 28:40.040]  You must be insane, Gavin.
[28:42.020 --> 28:42.460]  Anyway.
[28:43.160 --> 28:45.760]  I realized that with my CPAP machine.
[28:45.760 --> 28:48.600]  It's really just like a breathing thing.
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.360]  And I'm not getting air from my nose directly.
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.980]  It's exterior air.
[28:53.220 --> 28:55.340]  So I've been burrowing in.
[28:55.500 --> 28:57.100]  Because I like the weight.
[28:57.100 --> 28:58.560]  Of the thing on top of me.
[28:58.860 --> 29:00.520]  And I'm not dealing with the hot air.
[29:00.540 --> 29:02.000]  Because the air is coming from somewhere else.
[29:02.060 --> 29:03.220]  I'm getting external air.
[29:03.580 --> 29:08.440]  I feel like I'm above ground scuba diving.
[29:08.920 --> 29:10.380]  Like non-water scuba diving.
[29:10.440 --> 29:11.040]  With this thing on.
[29:11.120 --> 29:11.540]  It's great.
[29:11.820 --> 29:12.560]  I've been burrowing.
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.760]  Where does all the carbon dioxide you expel go?
[29:16.260 --> 29:17.180]  In a CPAP?
[29:17.260 --> 29:18.100]  I've never thought about that.
[29:18.580 --> 29:19.640]  Does it take it out too?
[29:20.280 --> 29:22.420]  Yeah, there's like a vent in the front.
[29:22.580 --> 29:25.240]  Are you just creating under your blankets.
[29:25.400 --> 29:26.900]  A situation that Gavin is dealing with.
[29:26.940 --> 29:28.300]  With his cats in his office?
[29:28.780 --> 29:29.680]  I don't think so.
[29:30.120 --> 29:32.080]  Well yeah, you would be increasing the carbon dioxide.
[29:32.400 --> 29:34.440]  In the trapped air area.
[29:34.680 --> 29:37.220]  But you're still getting regular air.
[29:37.600 --> 29:38.240]  I guess that's true.
[29:38.960 --> 29:41.440]  I mean, we're cranking the pressure.
[29:41.440 --> 29:42.780]  It's great.
[29:43.960 --> 29:44.980]  Did you say carbon monoxide?
[29:45.940 --> 29:48.360]  What? Did Geoff say carbon monoxide?
[29:48.380 --> 29:48.980]  Oh yeah, I did.
[29:50.060 --> 29:52.160]  He's sleeping in his car with the garage closed.
[29:52.340 --> 29:53.160]  With the CPAP on.
[29:54.640 --> 29:55.520]  That's next week.
[29:56.460 --> 29:57.860]  How's your body doing that?
[29:58.680 --> 30:02.220]  I just feel like it's unlocked a whole new layer of sleeping for me.
[30:02.420 --> 30:04.140]  I can sleep in any position now.
[30:04.460 --> 30:05.180]  It's great.
[30:05.320 --> 30:06.240]  I go on little adventures.
[30:06.960 --> 30:07.980]  Get the pillows stacked.
[30:08.820 --> 30:09.780]  I've done it too.
[30:09.980 --> 30:13.020]  I've done some under the pillow sleeping.
[30:13.480 --> 30:16.440]  But I do feel like if my face is too close to a pillow.
[30:16.860 --> 30:19.220]  The vent starts to create sound against the pillow.
[30:19.460 --> 30:20.000]  It starts to be like...
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.500]  Yeah, that can be a problem.
[30:22.480 --> 30:24.220]  If I just rewind it here for a second.
[30:24.420 --> 30:26.640]  What kind of little adventures are you going on?
[30:27.200 --> 30:29.680]  I'm just different layers of the different pillows.
[30:29.940 --> 30:31.840]  Sometimes we're going underneath a...
[30:31.840 --> 30:33.140]  Like a throw...
[30:33.140 --> 30:35.000]  Like a little blanket type situation.
[30:35.120 --> 30:36.620]  I just feel like I'm adventuring.
[30:36.680 --> 30:36.940]  What?
[30:38.560 --> 30:40.520]  I just feel like I'm exploring a little bit.
[30:40.640 --> 30:42.080]  I just feel like I'm sleeping in new ways.
[30:42.140 --> 30:42.780]  And it's exciting.
[30:43.120 --> 30:46.020]  So sometimes you're like cramming your head between 4 and 5.
[30:46.120 --> 30:46.440]  And you're like...
[30:48.220 --> 30:49.800]  Or like different weights.
[30:50.520 --> 30:51.680]  I like feeling trapped.
[30:52.920 --> 30:53.500]  In a safe way.
[30:57.760 --> 30:58.780]  I gotta say.
[30:58.960 --> 30:59.740]  Everything you said.
[30:59.800 --> 31:00.880]  I kind of know what he means.
[31:01.300 --> 31:03.880]  I kind of like being at the bottom.
[31:04.140 --> 31:06.540]  I don't know if I can handle the bottom of Pillow Mountain.
[31:06.660 --> 31:08.180]  That seems like a lot to deal with.
[31:08.180 --> 31:10.140]  3 or 4 pillows up.
[31:10.640 --> 31:11.440]  Put my head in.
[31:11.820 --> 31:13.300]  I quite like weight on my eyes.
[31:13.480 --> 31:15.620]  I tried a weighted sleeping mask.
[31:15.920 --> 31:17.720]  It wasn't very good.
[31:18.160 --> 31:20.600]  You're basically deep sea diving in your bed.
[31:21.040 --> 31:21.400]  I am.
[31:21.480 --> 31:22.980]  That's how I feel like I'm adventuring.
[31:23.500 --> 31:24.720]  You're like Jacques Cousteau.
[31:25.280 --> 31:27.000]  I feel like if I had...
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.060]  I feel like I would genuinely be able to sleep.
[31:29.120 --> 31:31.820]  If you put 8 pillows stacked high on my face.
[31:32.300 --> 31:33.420]  While I was papping.
[31:34.220 --> 31:35.420]  They're just pillows on my head.
[31:35.420 --> 31:38.160]  And then someone sat on the top of the pillows.
[31:38.280 --> 31:39.400]  I think I could sleep like that.
[31:39.820 --> 31:42.980]  So you would like to be the pea in the princess and the pea situation.
[31:43.080 --> 31:43.320]  Yes.
[31:43.600 --> 31:45.060]  I would be the bowling ball.
[31:46.260 --> 31:47.860]  At the bottom of the mattresses.
[31:48.740 --> 31:49.660]  It's really...
[31:49.660 --> 31:50.200]  It's comfy.
[31:50.500 --> 31:52.540]  It's like...
[31:52.540 --> 31:55.040]  I feel like I've never scuba'd before.
[31:55.160 --> 31:56.400]  I feel like I can scuba now.
[31:56.660 --> 31:58.460]  I feel like I've learned through this.
[31:59.280 --> 32:01.680]  I have scuba confidence because of the CPAP.
[32:01.920 --> 32:03.820]  I actually prefer...
[32:04.420 --> 32:07.240]  CPAP sleep than no CPAP sleep.
[32:07.380 --> 32:08.500]  There's something fun about it.
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.160]  I know people don't enjoy...
[32:10.160 --> 32:12.300]  Having to be hooked up to the machine typically.
[32:12.480 --> 32:13.360]  Actually, I like it.
[32:13.680 --> 32:14.440]  Well, it's not the point.
[32:14.540 --> 32:16.440]  It's that you're supposed to like it because you sleep well finally.
[32:16.560 --> 32:18.380]  No, but people that use it are like...
[32:18.380 --> 32:21.980]  This sucks having to have this machine attached to my face while I sleep.
[32:22.180 --> 32:23.400]  I actually kind of like it.
[32:23.460 --> 32:24.780]  I feel like I'm going on an adventure.
[32:25.180 --> 32:28.220]  Is that just because you have so few real life adventures?
[32:32.920 --> 32:34.620]  No, I just...
[32:34.620 --> 32:36.360]  I don't know.
[32:36.500 --> 32:37.360]  I'm just happy about it.
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.540]  Why do you have to yuck his yum?
[32:39.200 --> 32:39.700]  I don't know.
[32:41.500 --> 32:42.700]  Gavin, I'm with you.
[32:43.180 --> 32:44.340]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[32:44.960 --> 32:45.680]  I appreciate that.
[32:45.700 --> 32:47.580]  And it all comes down to Nick.
[32:48.120 --> 32:49.320]  Andrew, let's adventure.
[32:50.340 --> 32:51.240]  In his bed?
[32:51.820 --> 32:53.220]  Wait, hang on.
[32:53.340 --> 32:56.380]  Nick wants to adventure with Andrew?
[32:56.960 --> 32:57.800]  I mean, I'll help him out.
[32:59.280 --> 33:02.660]  I don't know if Nick's been paying attention to what's going on.
[33:02.680 --> 33:03.280]  What are you talking about?
[33:03.280 --> 33:05.800]  Nick's apparently in the other room right now having a conversation with him.
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.940]  Nick could use a hose with air going directly into his mouth, I think.
[33:10.800 --> 33:12.900]  Nick needs a CPAP when he's awake.
[33:13.260 --> 33:13.380]  Yeah.
[33:15.460 --> 33:20.440]  Oh, Christ.
[33:21.920 --> 33:23.060]  Nick can throw...
[33:23.060 --> 33:25.440]  I love spending more time with Nick.
[33:25.440 --> 33:26.220]  He'll just...
[33:27.420 --> 33:28.180]  chime in.
[33:28.300 --> 33:30.920]  And I don't know which side he's on, ever.
[33:31.560 --> 33:31.820]  What?
[33:33.100 --> 33:35.360]  I never expected going into
[33:35.360 --> 33:37.600]  face with you guys that Nick would be
[33:37.600 --> 33:38.840]  the wild card.
[33:39.440 --> 33:40.660]  But he kind of is.
[33:41.140 --> 33:44.040]  It's like that all the time, too.
[33:44.460 --> 33:46.020]  100% he's the same way.
[33:46.220 --> 33:47.420]  He's agreeing with you,
[33:47.500 --> 33:49.380]  but the way he says it makes it seem like
[33:49.380 --> 33:50.540]  he's disagreeing with you.
[33:50.800 --> 33:52.360]  And then you're like, are we in a fight?
[33:52.360 --> 33:53.420]  Like, what is it?
[33:53.420 --> 33:54.560]  And he just keeps going, yeah!
[33:55.080 --> 33:55.440]  What?
[33:58.300 --> 33:59.020]  It's crazy.
[34:01.160 --> 34:01.880]  I saw...
[34:01.880 --> 34:04.680]  I think I talked about this with the guys the other day.
[34:04.800 --> 34:06.320]  I saw a post on Reddit
[34:06.320 --> 34:07.800]  that was on the front page that was like,
[34:07.840 --> 34:09.980]  what legendary YouTube channel
[34:09.980 --> 34:11.360]  stopped making videos?
[34:11.400 --> 34:12.760]  And I wanted to see where Rooster Teeth ranked.
[34:13.220 --> 34:15.040]  So I went in and scrolled down and scrolled down and scrolled down.
[34:15.300 --> 34:16.940]  And then I finally saw someone said Achievement Hunter.
[34:17.240 --> 34:18.580]  So I replied and just said LOL.
[34:18.580 --> 34:21.040]  But then I was reading some of the comments
[34:21.040 --> 34:22.780]  and people were really going to bat for us.
[34:22.840 --> 34:23.840]  Like, check out Regulation Podcast.
[34:24.540 --> 34:25.420]  This is really awesome.
[34:26.280 --> 34:28.120]  Oh, they're still doing this stuff. It's so much fun.
[34:28.160 --> 34:29.280]  All these video game videos, whatever.
[34:29.500 --> 34:32.420]  And then it's like, oh, I like them all, but I hate Eric. Blah, blah, blah.
[34:32.540 --> 34:34.680]  Oh, when Andrew does this, I don't like it. Blah, blah, blah.
[34:34.780 --> 34:36.640]  There was one guy that's like, yeah, I like
[34:36.640 --> 34:37.980]  the show, but I can't stand Nick.
[34:38.300 --> 34:39.200]  And I was like,
[34:40.140 --> 34:41.900]  oh, right.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.580]  You don't need to worry about what people on the internet are saying.
[34:44.820 --> 34:46.520]  That is the craziest take.
[34:46.520 --> 34:47.840]  That blew me away.
[34:47.980 --> 34:50.640]  I can't stand Nick. What the fuck
[34:50.640 --> 34:52.040]  are you talking about?
[34:52.140 --> 34:54.400]  Wild, wild, crazy.
[34:55.080 --> 34:56.100]  Nick said
[34:56.100 --> 34:58.540]  the craziest thing I think I've ever
[34:58.540 --> 35:00.040]  heard him say yesterday.
[35:00.820 --> 35:02.340]  When we were recording
[35:02.340 --> 35:03.380]  a gameplay. Yeah.
[35:04.180 --> 35:05.260]  Gavin burped.
[35:06.020 --> 35:07.400]  Oh my god.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.460]  Do you remember what he said, Gavin?
[35:09.660 --> 35:11.780]  He said, oh,
[35:12.140 --> 35:13.900]  that sounded like a tasty one.
[35:14.780 --> 35:15.380]  Oh.
[35:16.280 --> 35:17.700]  We weren't recording.
[35:17.940 --> 35:19.820]  We were just getting ready
[35:19.820 --> 35:21.800]  to set things up. And that was
[35:21.800 --> 35:23.680]  his genuine reaction
[35:23.680 --> 35:25.500]  to Gavin's burp.
[35:25.680 --> 35:28.280]  It was so crazy
[35:28.280 --> 35:29.860]  it passed by without
[35:29.860 --> 35:30.880]  notice for a minute.
[35:32.860 --> 35:33.860]  You know the kind of burp where
[35:33.860 --> 35:35.180]  you can taste what you had for lunch.
[35:35.180 --> 35:37.080]  But that's never good.
[35:37.640 --> 35:38.700]  That's so gross.
[35:39.140 --> 35:40.500]  If you have a good lunch.
[35:40.500 --> 35:42.380]  Some foods
[35:42.380 --> 35:42.800]  is good.
[35:43.700 --> 35:45.340]  There are some great burps.
[35:46.780 --> 35:48.420]  You're right though about Nick being the
[35:48.420 --> 35:50.120]  wild card because Michael brought this up
[35:50.120 --> 35:51.940]  where he's like, oh, you play video games with Geoff.
[35:52.040 --> 35:54.140]  Geoff will throw a grenade and he's like, run, run, run.
[35:54.220 --> 35:56.240]  I'm like, yeah, that doesn't really happen with what we're doing.
[35:56.340 --> 35:58.280]  Mostly it's Nick listening to
[35:58.280 --> 36:00.180]  Gavin. And that's
[36:00.180 --> 36:01.700]  ultimately our problem.
[36:02.100 --> 36:04.180]  When you hear about this
[36:04.180 --> 36:04.700]  burp.
[36:06.880 --> 36:08.220]  You just go like,
[36:08.220 --> 36:10.240]  yeah, I mean, Gavin's like egging him on
[36:10.240 --> 36:12.300]  but it's not like it takes even like a push.
[36:12.480 --> 36:14.260]  It's just like a kernel of an
[36:14.260 --> 36:16.440]  idea. Like he's incepting Nick while he's awake.
[36:18.760 --> 36:20.220]  But the inception is
[36:20.220 --> 36:22.260]  just going, hey, what about
[36:22.260 --> 36:22.960]  this?
[36:25.280 --> 36:25.720]  Somehow
[36:25.720 --> 36:28.000]  it's going seven layers deep and
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.200]  burrowing into an idea. It's like working.
[36:34.920 --> 36:35.560]  Do you guys
[36:36.420 --> 36:37.320]  you guys know
[36:37.320 --> 36:39.700]  you guys ever see those articles online or like
[36:39.700 --> 36:41.480]  on Reddit or whatever or TikTok where they're like
[36:42.100 --> 36:43.420]  what's something that you could do in
[36:43.420 --> 36:45.680]  2000 that just doesn't exist or you can't do
[36:45.680 --> 36:47.480]  or the world doesn't work that way in 2025?
[36:48.180 --> 36:49.500]  You know what I'm talking about? You ever see those?
[36:49.860 --> 36:51.480]  No, but I know what you mean. I see them a lot.
[36:51.540 --> 36:53.560]  And they're like, it's like, oh, you used to be able to
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.740]  walk up to the fucking gate at an airplane
[36:55.740 --> 36:57.540]  before 9-11. Sure. Like those kinds
[36:57.540 --> 36:59.460]  of things. I was at the grocery store with
[36:59.460 --> 37:01.620]  Emily the other day at H-E-B and we were leaving
[37:01.620 --> 37:03.340]  and I realized that
[37:03.880 --> 37:05.260]  we had the shopping cart
[37:05.260 --> 37:07.420]  we were taking it out and it did that thing where it locked
[37:07.420 --> 37:09.360]  and we couldn't go any further and a guy had to go
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.420]  oh I'm sorry and he had to like press a
[37:11.420 --> 37:13.240]  device at our shopping cart to
[37:13.240 --> 37:14.980]  unrelease it so we could go outside with it.
[37:15.320 --> 37:17.140]  Because I guess they have shopping cart theft
[37:17.140 --> 37:19.000]  they have to deal with. And that got me thinking
[37:19.660 --> 37:21.560]  you couldn't launch jackass
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.320]  in 2025.
[37:23.300 --> 37:25.220]  So much of the beginning of that
[37:25.220 --> 37:26.960]  series was shopping cart related.
[37:27.220 --> 37:29.320]  You just can't steal and use shopping carts
[37:29.320 --> 37:31.420]  in 2025 anymore. They have the protective devices
[37:31.420 --> 37:33.560]  on them so they don't go outside of the
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.580]  parking lot. You'd have to jailbreak your cart
[37:35.580 --> 37:37.660]  first. You'd have to jailbreak your shopping cart
[37:37.660 --> 37:39.460]  so that you could run it into a shrub.
[37:41.000 --> 37:41.400]  If
[37:41.880 --> 37:43.440]  the jackass guys started today
[37:43.440 --> 37:45.540]  they would have a much harder time
[37:45.540 --> 37:47.700]  than they did way back in whenever it started.
[37:48.300 --> 37:49.080]  That was my realization.
[37:49.880 --> 37:51.540]  I couldn't think of a more lower
[37:51.540 --> 37:52.660]  stakes heist
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.500]  than finding a way to steal a row of
[37:55.500 --> 37:57.460]  shopping, like a bunch of shopping carts.
[37:58.320 --> 37:59.560]  Starts out low stakes but they made
[37:59.560 --> 38:00.920]  hundreds of millions of dollars off that.
[38:03.160 --> 38:05.480]  I don't mean individual theft of them.
[38:05.600 --> 38:07.460]  I'm imagining someone being like, okay, we're gonna
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.540]  hit HEB where it hurts. We're stealing
[38:09.540 --> 38:10.600]  all of the carts.
[38:11.200 --> 38:13.500]  I think if you stole a line of
[38:13.500 --> 38:15.020]  40 shopping carts
[38:15.460 --> 38:17.560]  that would be the loudest possible thing
[38:17.560 --> 38:18.300]  to steal.
[38:19.460 --> 38:21.120]  That would be pretty good.
[38:22.220 --> 38:23.580]  When I worked at
[38:23.580 --> 38:25.520]  Target was my first job and I pushed
[38:25.520 --> 38:27.700]  carts and it was just
[38:27.700 --> 38:29.780]  line them all up as many as
[38:29.780 --> 38:31.740]  you could and then push them to
[38:31.740 --> 38:33.800]  the front of the store again from the parking lot.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.800]  It was, just looking
[38:35.800 --> 38:37.640]  back on it, it was so loud.
[38:37.780 --> 38:39.940]  I never thought about it. It's so loud.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.220]  Just being 16 years old,
[38:41.460 --> 38:43.720]  pushing 30 carts as
[38:43.720 --> 38:44.460]  hard as you can.
[38:45.300 --> 38:47.460]  Just like a
[38:47.460 --> 38:49.780]  sensory overload for 8 hours
[38:49.780 --> 38:51.800]  a day. I'd never thought
[38:51.800 --> 38:53.480]  about that. Yeah, it's loud as shit.
[38:53.920 --> 38:55.020]  Speaking of carts and gaming,
[38:55.020 --> 38:57.160]  thing I need to talk about.
[38:57.300 --> 38:58.840]  I've been excited about this for a while.
[38:59.440 --> 39:01.080]  They announced a
[39:01.080 --> 39:02.260]  Garfield Cart 2.
[39:02.800 --> 39:04.380]  And it is fucked.
[39:05.220 --> 39:06.720]  In like the way
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.780]  that only Garfield Cart
[39:08.780 --> 39:10.900]  could be. First of all, they
[39:10.900 --> 39:12.700]  didn't announce it via a trailer
[39:12.700 --> 39:14.960]  or announcement. There's just a Steam
[39:14.960 --> 39:16.840]  page now for Garfield
[39:16.840 --> 39:19.020]  Cart 2 and there's no other
[39:19.020 --> 39:20.900]  material on it. It just is like,
[39:20.960 --> 39:22.440]  hey, this is going to be a thing
[39:22.440 --> 39:23.520]  that happens.
[39:24.300 --> 39:26.140]  The other issue is that this is
[39:26.140 --> 39:27.400]  Garfield Cart 3.
[39:28.240 --> 39:29.840]  I don't know what
[39:30.160 --> 39:32.460]  they're doing. Because there was Garfield
[39:32.460 --> 39:34.220]  Cart and then there was Garfield Cart
[39:34.220 --> 39:36.380]  Furious Racing and now there's
[39:36.380 --> 39:37.620]  Garfield Cart 2.
[39:38.140 --> 39:40.120]  So I don't know if they're
[39:40.120 --> 39:41.980]  disregarding the first one or
[39:41.980 --> 39:43.060]  Furious Racing.
[39:44.540 --> 39:46.220]  They've named their third
[39:46.220 --> 39:48.300]  one 2 for no
[39:48.300 --> 39:50.500]  reason. I'm very worried.
[39:50.500 --> 39:52.220]  I'm very worried about the quality of this game.
[39:52.300 --> 39:54.680]  It's a different dev team. The quality?
[39:55.340 --> 39:56.560]  Maybe it's a prequel to
[39:56.560 --> 39:58.560]  Furious Racing. It could be,
[39:58.720 --> 40:00.620]  but it's a different dev team
[40:01.100 --> 40:02.660]  and their last game
[40:02.660 --> 40:03.800]  was Smurfs Racing,
[40:04.320 --> 40:06.280]  which did not have online
[40:06.280 --> 40:08.360]  multiplayer. So I'm worried.
[40:08.460 --> 40:10.580]  I'm worried that there won't be any online multiplayer in this thing.
[40:10.760 --> 40:12.220]  It does have a leaderboard,
[40:12.320 --> 40:14.200]  apparently, Smurfs Racing, but
[40:15.420 --> 40:16.660]  there could be more Garfield
[40:16.660 --> 40:18.340]  Cart in our life. Garfield Cart 2
[40:18.340 --> 40:20.440]  Slash 3. Has much been shown
[40:20.440 --> 40:22.260]  from Garfield Cart 2 Slash 3?
[40:22.680 --> 40:24.480]  No, not that I've seen. Like, it's just
[40:24.480 --> 40:26.240]  a Steam page. I don't think there's a trailer
[40:26.240 --> 40:27.840]  out for it, at least last time I looked.
[40:28.420 --> 40:30.340]  I just, I got really excited because all
[40:30.340 --> 40:32.300]  these people were tagging me that Garfield Cart 2
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.360]  is coming. And then I looked
[40:34.360 --> 40:36.540]  at it and it's like, it's just a Steam page.
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.500]  Like, it's not even an announcement.
[40:38.660 --> 40:40.400]  Like, they just made a store page
[40:40.400 --> 40:42.200]  for a thing. I don't think they've even
[40:42.200 --> 40:43.800]  officially commented on it.
[40:44.040 --> 40:46.660]  What if it's just some guy made a page for it?
[40:46.660 --> 40:48.280]  No, it looks like a real game.
[40:48.420 --> 40:50.800]  And it has like, everything's credentialed
[40:50.800 --> 40:52.100]  the right way, but it just is not.
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.640]  It's not looking good for Garfield Cart.
[40:55.080 --> 40:56.560]  As someone who's a believer, you know,
[40:56.600 --> 40:58.580]  people, people swear by Sonic
[40:58.580 --> 41:00.580]  Racing. Obviously, Mario
[41:00.580 --> 41:02.460]  Cart, leader in the space, but Garfield
[41:02.460 --> 41:04.600]  Cart 2, Furious Race, they really figured out
[41:04.600 --> 41:06.260]  some things in that racer.
[41:06.880 --> 41:08.620]  And, uh, I'm gonna
[41:08.620 --> 41:10.700]  wait. Oh, yeah. Eric just posted
[41:10.700 --> 41:12.340]  the box art. It looks like shit.
[41:12.880 --> 41:13.760]  All you can drift.
[41:14.720 --> 41:15.600]  The proportions
[41:15.600 --> 41:17.180]  on Garfield are not right.
[41:18.080 --> 41:19.780]  No. His head
[41:19.780 --> 41:21.420]  to bottom has a little
[41:21.420 --> 41:23.720]  teeth. He has mean teeth.
[41:23.800 --> 41:24.960]  Nermal's wearing a little hat.
[41:26.320 --> 41:27.560]  Here's, for reference,
[41:28.500 --> 41:29.680]  here's... Oh, that's a
[41:29.680 --> 41:31.780]  quality game. That's a good looking Garfield right there.
[41:32.040 --> 41:33.900]  Yeah. That's a great Garfield Furious Racing.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.660]  Great game. Yeah. Do you think
[41:35.660 --> 41:36.680]  it'll come out on Switch 2?
[41:37.540 --> 41:39.940]  I think everything's coming out on Switch 2 that can.
[41:40.540 --> 41:41.840]  Oh, cool. I can't believe
[41:41.840 --> 41:43.760]  Cyberpunk's on Switch 2. How does that run?
[41:44.500 --> 41:46.160]  Wild. Not just that it's on Switch 2.
[41:46.220 --> 41:47.980]  It's all on the cartridge, which is
[41:47.980 --> 41:50.000]  insane. Yeah. It's really impressive.
[41:50.800 --> 41:51.820]  I had another
[41:52.540 --> 41:53.980]  racing video game related
[41:53.980 --> 41:55.100]  thing. I'm gonna share my screen.
[41:55.820 --> 41:57.700]  I got an achievement in a unique way
[41:57.700 --> 41:58.580]  in Roadcraft.
[41:59.640 --> 42:02.140]  We filmed a few videos in Roadcraft.
[42:02.560 --> 42:03.340]  It's so good!
[42:03.900 --> 42:05.620]  It's great. It's a great game.
[42:06.120 --> 42:07.200]  It's the best game I've ever played.
[42:08.020 --> 42:09.080]  Gavin got that achievement
[42:09.080 --> 42:11.180]  that I got that I'm gonna show
[42:11.180 --> 42:12.820]  in a video that we filmed.
[42:13.260 --> 42:15.400]  I don't even know how I got it, but I checked and I had it.
[42:15.460 --> 42:17.060]  Is it the falling one?
[42:17.960 --> 42:19.080]  It's the falling one.
[42:19.940 --> 42:21.200]  So, this is a clip
[42:21.200 --> 42:22.940]  of me and I
[42:22.940 --> 42:25.280]  talked to Nick, so I think we're recording this
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.780]  and it'll be in the YouTube version. Are you unsunken here?
[42:27.320 --> 42:29.040]  I am unsunken here. I'm
[42:29.040 --> 42:31.340]  trying to clean up a road, so I filled up
[42:31.340 --> 42:33.360]  literally as many blocks
[42:33.360 --> 42:34.220]  as I can.
[42:34.940 --> 42:37.080]  Pieces of cement. And I had just
[42:37.080 --> 42:39.100]  spent a lot of time looking at my map. I'm gonna hit this clip.
[42:39.220 --> 42:41.100]  So, we're starting. I'm like, okay, I'm ready to go.
[42:41.740 --> 42:42.960]  Let's go. Oh, no! I
[42:42.960 --> 42:45.320]  filled it up and I'm tipping. That sucks.
[42:46.320 --> 42:47.300]  And then this
[42:47.300 --> 42:47.720]  happens.
[42:49.020 --> 42:49.380]  Yeah.
[42:50.420 --> 42:53.200]  Yeah, that happened to my friend, I think, one time.
[42:53.540 --> 42:55.120]  Yeah. I've seen that
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.000]  a few hundred times in SnowRunner. Oh, yeah.
[42:57.700 --> 42:59.020]  That's a SnowRunner thing?
[42:59.100 --> 43:00.960]  This is a carryover? Oh, yeah.
[43:00.960 --> 43:02.680]  I've never experienced this before.
[43:03.000 --> 43:04.960]  Oh, yeah. You're like a
[43:04.960 --> 43:06.820]  tornado. I am destroying
[43:06.820 --> 43:08.700]  all of the trees in the area.
[43:08.900 --> 43:10.920]  I'm flipping around. I'm flying for people
[43:10.920 --> 43:13.120]  that are just listening. My truck is spinning
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.900]  like a tornado rapidly
[43:14.900 --> 43:16.980]  in all directions. But unlike
[43:16.980 --> 43:18.780]  SnowRunner, there's no vehicle health,
[43:18.880 --> 43:20.900]  so I'm not taking damage. You just got deep
[43:20.900 --> 43:22.980]  water. You are what happened to that
[43:22.980 --> 43:23.300]  town.
[43:24.900 --> 43:26.700]  I'll show you where I end up.
[43:27.020 --> 43:28.180]  You're the natural disaster.
[43:29.940 --> 43:30.860]  That's where I end up.
[43:31.480 --> 43:32.560]  Upside down on the roof?
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.020]  Upside down on a roof.
[43:35.180 --> 43:35.540]  Wow.
[43:36.180 --> 43:38.440]  I'm just bouncing around. I'm stuck. I'm
[43:38.440 --> 43:39.880]  wiggling. He's trying to get out.
[43:40.120 --> 43:42.440]  I'm trying to use my crane to get me
[43:42.440 --> 43:43.700]  off of this building.
[43:44.240 --> 43:46.300]  The problem you have here, too, is that you can just
[43:46.300 --> 43:48.460]  recover, but you're going to leave all that concrete on that
[43:48.460 --> 43:50.380]  roof. But that's okay, because I just
[43:50.380 --> 43:52.220]  didn't want it on the road. I think that's
[43:52.220 --> 43:54.300]  eventually the conclusion I
[43:54.300 --> 43:55.700]  come to is
[43:55.700 --> 43:58.220]  I realize, oh, I can strap, but my engine is
[43:58.220 --> 43:59.880]  stalled, so I can't
[43:59.880 --> 44:01.820]  activate things the way I want.
[44:02.240 --> 44:03.780]  But I think I get off of it.
[44:03.920 --> 44:05.900]  Yeah, I release it, and then there we
[44:05.900 --> 44:06.320]  go.
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.940]  And then I just start spinning. It starts
[44:09.940 --> 44:10.500]  breaking.
[44:11.680 --> 44:13.860]  It's like your boom does not move that
[44:13.860 --> 44:15.180]  fast. That's crazy.
[44:15.620 --> 44:17.860]  It's like it got spun around, and it has
[44:17.860 --> 44:19.860]  to spin back all the times it's spun around.
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.100]  It's like I was possessed. But that has been
[44:22.100 --> 44:24.060]  some of my road craft adventures recently.
[44:24.060 --> 44:25.660]  It broke, and I got the achievement
[44:25.660 --> 44:27.660]  in the process of me
[44:27.660 --> 44:29.820]  just flying around the map
[44:29.820 --> 44:31.880]  as a tornado truck. It was
[44:31.880 --> 44:32.860]  a great time.
[44:34.100 --> 44:35.960]  We have filmed two videos
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.920]  in that game. One with
[44:37.920 --> 44:39.760]  three of us, and one with four of us. And just
[44:39.760 --> 44:42.040]  so we're clear, I personally
[44:42.040 --> 44:43.800]  would like to film one thousand
[44:43.800 --> 44:45.380]  more videos in this game.
[44:46.080 --> 44:47.780]  If and whenever you guys want to.
[44:48.560 --> 44:49.760]  3am, I'm up for filming
[44:49.760 --> 44:51.620]  videos in this game. I never want to stop
[44:51.620 --> 44:53.520]  playing this game. It's amazing.
[44:53.720 --> 44:55.880]  It's so much fun. There have been so many great
[44:55.880 --> 44:58.100]  games. And then Mind's Eye also came out.
[44:58.960 --> 45:00.020]  What's Mind's Eye?
[45:01.020 --> 45:01.860]  Mind's Eye was
[45:01.860 --> 45:03.060]  a game.
[45:03.940 --> 45:05.840]  Yeah. It's
[45:05.840 --> 45:08.060]  one of the studio
[45:08.060 --> 45:09.820]  heads of Rockstar
[45:09.820 --> 45:11.460]  left and made their own studio
[45:11.460 --> 45:13.000]  called Build a Rocket Boy.
[45:13.640 --> 45:15.780]  And Mind's Eye is the first game
[45:15.780 --> 45:17.740]  under that umbrella. And it looks
[45:17.740 --> 45:19.360]  like it's supposed to be
[45:19.360 --> 45:21.800]  an open world action game, but it's
[45:21.800 --> 45:23.820]  a linear action game in an open world that
[45:23.820 --> 45:25.800]  has nothing in it. And it
[45:25.800 --> 45:27.780]  is incredibly broken in so many
[45:27.780 --> 45:28.980]  ways. It's so stupid.
[45:29.840 --> 45:31.720]  What's that game you guys did a video in
[45:31.720 --> 45:33.940]  yesterday? I saw on the Discord. Oh, we
[45:33.940 --> 45:35.980]  played The Altars, which is a really
[45:35.980 --> 45:37.960]  cool game in which
[45:37.960 --> 45:39.900]  you get stranded on a planet
[45:39.900 --> 45:41.500]  and you're trying to escape it, essentially.
[45:42.040 --> 45:43.740]  By recovering resources on the planet.
[45:44.120 --> 45:45.760]  It looked so interesting. Single
[45:45.760 --> 45:47.640]  player, though? It is single player only.
[45:47.980 --> 45:49.820]  Yeah. That would be
[45:49.820 --> 45:51.600]  so cool, though, if it had multiplayer
[45:51.600 --> 45:53.360]  and you were just waiting to be born.
[45:54.340 --> 45:55.620]  That would be cool.
[45:56.060 --> 45:57.820]  Because you have to
[45:57.820 --> 45:59.760]  make a thing called the womb and you create
[46:00.660 --> 46:01.820]  iterations of you.
[46:02.420 --> 46:03.420]  So yeah, you're just waiting.
[46:04.040 --> 46:05.300]  Player 2 plays the sheep.
[46:06.820 --> 46:07.560]  Mind's Eye
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.660]  is, I think, the worst game I've
[46:09.660 --> 46:11.800]  played this year. And it's very popular
[46:11.800 --> 46:13.840]  worst. It's gotten a lot of attention
[46:13.840 --> 46:15.360]  due to how bad it is.
[46:15.780 --> 46:17.000]  Do you think it'll get good over time?
[46:17.520 --> 46:19.760]  No, that's the problem. They're fixing it.
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.820]  They're fixing a lot of the bugs
[46:21.820 --> 46:23.940]  but it just as a core game
[46:23.940 --> 46:25.700]  is not great to play.
[46:25.860 --> 46:27.620]  It's not a ton of fun. What platform is it on?
[46:28.100 --> 46:28.820]  It's on everything.
[46:29.240 --> 46:32.080]  It's a 500 million dollar budgeted game
[46:32.080 --> 46:33.860]  that is. Is there
[46:33.860 --> 46:35.740]  multiplayer? They're going to add it
[46:35.740 --> 46:37.860]  apparently, but I don't... it's one of those
[46:37.860 --> 46:39.840]  things where I'd be surprised if they continue to
[46:39.840 --> 46:41.320]  support it in any way.
[46:41.560 --> 46:43.840]  If they add it, we gotta do it.
[46:43.940 --> 46:45.700]  Oh, we definitely have to do it. I 100%
[46:45.700 --> 46:47.720]  I got all the achievements. I needed to see everything
[46:47.720 --> 46:49.000]  that was in that thing. Wait.
[46:49.980 --> 46:51.820]  You 100%ed a game
[46:51.820 --> 46:53.800]  that you didn't... What?
[46:54.240 --> 46:55.840]  It's the worst game you played this
[46:55.840 --> 46:57.900]  year and you 100%ed it? I needed to
[46:57.900 --> 46:59.900]  see everything that was in that thing
[46:59.900 --> 47:01.240]  because it is fucking... Why?
[47:01.420 --> 47:03.680]  It's just insane. It's
[47:03.680 --> 47:05.820]  uh, you, like, it is
[47:05.820 --> 47:07.640]  a completely empty open world.
[47:07.760 --> 47:08.980]  There's nothing you can do.
[47:09.540 --> 47:11.700]  I played a mission where
[47:11.700 --> 47:13.560]  you have to drive
[47:13.560 --> 47:15.520]  five miles. There's no map!
[47:15.520 --> 47:17.700]  You have a mini map and that's
[47:17.700 --> 47:19.460]  it. You can't open the map. There's no
[47:19.460 --> 47:21.620]  broader... Like, you can't see the world map
[47:21.620 --> 47:23.520]  in any way. They just don't want you to see how
[47:23.520 --> 47:25.440]  small the map is? No, it's huge!
[47:25.600 --> 47:27.560]  That's the problem! It's a fucking huge
[47:27.560 --> 47:29.540]  map! And if you go in a
[47:29.540 --> 47:31.500]  direction they don't want, they'll fail the mission
[47:31.500 --> 47:33.540]  on you. Uh, so I'm driving
[47:33.540 --> 47:35.580]  a car and the only time you
[47:35.580 --> 47:37.500]  get a waypoint marker is when you're in your
[47:37.500 --> 47:39.160]  vehicle. So I'm in a vehicle
[47:39.160 --> 47:41.740]  and I'm driving and it gets destroyed
[47:41.740 --> 47:43.680]  and you can't steal random
[47:43.680 --> 47:45.840]  vehicles on the street. Uh,
[47:45.840 --> 47:47.600]  and it's also a scenario in the game
[47:47.600 --> 47:49.340]  in which all the cars are gone.
[47:49.540 --> 47:51.440]  So I had to run five miles
[47:51.440 --> 47:53.660]  on foot without being able to see the
[47:53.660 --> 47:55.880]  map and there being no enemies
[47:55.880 --> 47:57.720]  of any kind. And it
[47:57.720 --> 47:59.760]  was a thing where I'd be running and then the guy
[47:59.760 --> 48:01.540]  would say, Whoa, where you going, buddy?
[48:01.560 --> 48:03.620]  That's the wrong way! And I'm just running towards
[48:03.620 --> 48:05.560]  the marker. So then I'd have to turn
[48:05.560 --> 48:07.660]  around and run like four blocks.
[48:07.780 --> 48:09.200]  I spent 30 minutes
[48:09.200 --> 48:11.660]  real time having to run
[48:11.660 --> 48:13.560]  to this location to do
[48:13.560 --> 48:15.580]  the mission. It is horrendously
[48:15.580 --> 48:16.740]  bad. It is, like,
[48:18.100 --> 48:19.560]  impressively, I flipped my
[48:19.560 --> 48:21.460]  car, it was on fire
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.560]  and I tried to leave and it
[48:23.560 --> 48:25.480]  wouldn't let me. And I thought, Oh, it's just
[48:25.480 --> 48:27.740]  broken. And then I realized there's a button
[48:27.740 --> 48:29.640]  to flip your car because the car weight
[48:29.640 --> 48:31.580]  physics are really weird. So like
[48:31.580 --> 48:33.540]  you're constantly flipping your vehicle over and then
[48:33.540 --> 48:34.940]  you're pushing X to get it back up.
[48:35.420 --> 48:37.520]  There was no way to exit your vehicle upside
[48:37.520 --> 48:39.500]  down. So my car is in
[48:39.500 --> 48:41.500]  complete flames and I had
[48:41.500 --> 48:43.580]  to reorient it to be back
[48:43.580 --> 48:45.520]  on its wheels before it would let me leave
[48:45.520 --> 48:47.500]  the vehicle before it
[48:47.500 --> 48:48.940]  exploded. It is
[48:49.480 --> 48:51.360]  so bad. There's a boss fight
[48:51.960 --> 48:53.060]  where it's like
[48:53.060 --> 48:55.540]  the boss gets called and is like, Kill this
[48:55.540 --> 48:57.560]  person. And instead of killing them
[48:57.560 --> 48:59.520]  for some reason, they take them to the roof
[48:59.520 --> 49:01.140]  and then you chase them
[49:01.140 --> 49:03.520]  and then you go to fight them and they're like, Nah
[49:03.520 --> 49:05.380]  actually I'm gonna step away and you're gonna fight
[49:05.380 --> 49:07.520]  drones instead. And
[49:07.520 --> 49:09.620]  so you're fighting drones for no reason
[49:09.620 --> 49:11.580]  but you can ping and I noticed
[49:11.580 --> 49:13.700]  when I pinged, I got a marker for where
[49:13.700 --> 49:15.220]  they hid the like
[49:15.220 --> 49:17.360]  the NPC of the boss.
[49:17.820 --> 49:19.160]  They just put him in a wall
[49:19.160 --> 49:21.480]  and I was looking and like there
[49:21.480 --> 49:23.400]  was no door to where they could have been
[49:23.400 --> 49:25.400]  but I'm still getting a marker for him. It is
[49:25.400 --> 49:26.980]  a disaster. He was...
[49:27.380 --> 49:29.240]  I could go on and on but it's
[49:29.240 --> 49:31.540]  so impressively bad and it's
[49:31.540 --> 49:33.440]  weird in a way that I couldn't
[49:33.440 --> 49:35.580]  resist. I had to keep playing.
[49:35.580 --> 49:37.620]  You unlock free mode
[49:37.620 --> 49:39.220]  by beating the game
[49:39.220 --> 49:41.680]  but there's nothing to do in the world.
[49:41.960 --> 49:42.940]  That's nuts.
[49:44.300 --> 49:45.560]  That is part of it
[49:45.560 --> 49:47.660]  is like it's sort of build tools
[49:47.660 --> 49:49.700]  so the idea being that like
[49:49.700 --> 49:51.920]  you can build all of these experiences
[49:51.920 --> 49:52.740]  yourself
[49:53.580 --> 49:55.700]  if you're on PC and you have the PC version
[49:55.700 --> 49:56.140]  of it.
[49:57.400 --> 49:59.340]  But it's just, it's
[49:59.340 --> 50:01.000]  it's incoherent.
[50:01.400 --> 50:02.500]  They outsource the
[50:02.500 --> 50:04.400]  the game creation to you.
[50:04.880 --> 50:06.420]  That's sort of the idea.
[50:06.960 --> 50:08.900]  It has had such a bad
[50:08.900 --> 50:10.740]  launch. I think the
[50:10.740 --> 50:12.860]  like Steam highest concurrence
[50:12.860 --> 50:13.860]  is under 2000.
[50:15.160 --> 50:16.740]  So I just, I don't
[50:16.740 --> 50:18.620]  I think they're going to drop everything for it
[50:18.620 --> 50:20.580]  and what's unfortunate is this summer they're supposed
[50:20.580 --> 50:22.080]  to add Agent 47
[50:22.080 --> 50:23.620]  for a Hitman mission
[50:24.160 --> 50:26.540]  and I just don't think that'll happen now.
[50:27.040 --> 50:28.360]  But he'll only be inside a wall.
[50:28.820 --> 50:30.980]  It will only be in a wall.
[50:30.980 --> 50:32.940]  It's just weird things
[50:32.940 --> 50:34.220]  for me of like
[50:34.920 --> 50:37.080]  Lizzie McGuire, the show Lizzie McGuire
[50:37.080 --> 50:38.880]  the little brother from that show plays
[50:38.880 --> 50:40.560]  an Elon Musk character in this
[50:40.560 --> 50:42.320]  and it just looks like him
[50:42.860 --> 50:44.920]  and so it's like I'm playing and then I'm going
[50:44.920 --> 50:47.000]  that looks like Lizzie McGuire's
[50:47.000 --> 50:48.960]  little brother and then it actually is
[50:48.960 --> 50:49.860]  like it's just so
[50:49.860 --> 50:52.740]  it's so bizarre. Is he playing
[50:52.740 --> 50:54.200]  Lizzie McGuire's brother in the game?
[50:54.560 --> 50:57.180]  He is playing Elon Musk.
[50:57.920 --> 50:58.480]  Essentially
[50:58.480 --> 51:00.540]  is the thing that he's
[51:00.540 --> 51:01.780]  going for in that game.
[51:02.460 --> 51:04.700]  I can't believe you 100%ed this thing.
[51:04.880 --> 51:05.980]  You're crazy.
[51:06.620 --> 51:08.340]  Just a heads up for the portion of our audience that
[51:08.340 --> 51:10.520]  does not like video games and doesn't watch
[51:10.520 --> 51:12.340]  our gameplay. We are filming three
[51:12.340 --> 51:13.380]  drafts tomorrow.
[51:14.320 --> 51:14.500]  Yes.
[51:17.100 --> 51:17.960]  It's true.
[51:18.200 --> 51:20.580]  It's true. Lots of drafts on the
[51:20.580 --> 51:22.460]  lots of non-video game related
[51:22.460 --> 51:24.280]  content on the books coming up.
[51:25.500 --> 51:26.620]  Just FYI.
[51:26.620 --> 51:28.580]  Want to make sure the audience knows we're servicing
[51:28.580 --> 51:29.920]  both sides there.
[51:30.420 --> 51:32.780]  Yes. I'm excited for the drafts tomorrow.
[51:33.600 --> 51:34.340]  I gotta do research.
[51:35.040 --> 51:36.500]  Yeah, I haven't been able to do
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.480]  any real work on them yet.
[51:38.560 --> 51:40.100]  That's going to be my tonight. Yeah, I'll do that tonight.
[51:40.340 --> 51:42.560]  I've started bringing video game
[51:42.560 --> 51:43.600]  glitches into real life.
[51:44.360 --> 51:46.400]  It kind of happened unintentionally but I dropped something
[51:46.400 --> 51:48.520]  the other day and my first instinct was just
[51:48.520 --> 51:49.900]  to T-pose in place.
[51:50.660 --> 51:52.740]  Like my life had gone wrong a little bit.
[51:53.060 --> 51:54.680]  And I'm just going to incorporate that more
[51:54.680 --> 51:56.220]  every time I drop something.
[51:56.980 --> 51:58.760]  You're going to convince somebody that they're in the
[51:58.760 --> 51:59.100]  matrix?
[52:01.660 --> 52:02.680]  I do so much
[52:02.680 --> 52:04.500]  stuff that no one sees.
[52:04.740 --> 52:05.800]  Just because it makes me giggle.
[52:07.080 --> 52:08.600]  Is T-posing the next...
[52:08.600 --> 52:10.200]  Outside of T-posing,
[52:10.820 --> 52:12.100]  what is something you do?
[52:12.920 --> 52:14.280]  I once... this kind of
[52:14.280 --> 52:16.840]  really disturbed Meg. She didn't like it at all.
[52:17.040 --> 52:18.380]  But I once was just
[52:18.380 --> 52:20.520]  awake in the house on my own.
[52:21.660 --> 52:22.420]  Meg was still asleep.
[52:22.420 --> 52:24.420]  And I thought, I wonder if I can...
[52:26.200 --> 52:28.280]  I was like, I wonder what it would look like
[52:28.280 --> 52:29.780]  if my legs kidnapped me.
[52:30.080 --> 52:31.160]  And I just...
[52:31.160 --> 52:34.840]  What the fuck?
[52:36.160 --> 52:37.220]  Are you alright?
[52:38.460 --> 52:40.320]  So I laid down on the floor as if I was
[52:40.320 --> 52:42.480]  asleep or unconscious and then I just started
[52:42.480 --> 52:44.440]  walking around but just from the knees
[52:44.440 --> 52:44.840]  down.
[52:45.340 --> 52:48.040]  So my legs
[52:48.820 --> 52:50.440]  were dragging the rest of
[52:50.440 --> 52:52.260]  my body around the house
[52:52.260 --> 52:53.500]  while I was like
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.480]  completely lying down with my arms up above
[52:56.480 --> 52:57.040]  my head.
[52:58.220 --> 53:00.480]  And I showed her a video of it
[53:00.480 --> 53:01.840]  and she was like, oh, that's creepy.
[53:02.540 --> 53:03.460]  She hated it.
[53:04.980 --> 53:06.560]  Are we talking like an
[53:06.560 --> 53:08.500]  Addams Family thing with like the hand
[53:08.500 --> 53:10.340]  but it's your legs like becoming
[53:10.340 --> 53:12.040]  sentient? Yeah, so imagine
[53:12.040 --> 53:14.400]  you're just lying down completely flat on
[53:14.400 --> 53:16.300]  your back and your arms
[53:16.300 --> 53:18.580]  are extended like out behind your head so they're
[53:20.100 --> 53:20.980]  wrists down
[53:20.980 --> 53:22.840]  behind you and then just start
[53:22.840 --> 53:23.280]  walking.
[53:26.680 --> 53:28.700]  I like T-posing a lot more than this.
[53:28.920 --> 53:29.000]  Okay.
[53:30.780 --> 53:32.300]  I'm a big fan of the T-posing.
[53:32.600 --> 53:34.780]  I did like a whole lap of the kitchen just being
[53:34.780 --> 53:36.600]  dragged by my shins.
[53:39.820 --> 53:40.960]  What, you guys don't do that?
[53:41.440 --> 53:42.680]  You guys don't kidnap yourself?
[53:43.120 --> 53:44.880]  I don't think I've ever kidnapped myself.
[53:45.160 --> 53:46.340]  I don't think so.
[53:47.960 --> 53:48.780]  Oh man,
[53:48.900 --> 53:49.560]  teach their own.
[53:51.960 --> 53:54.040]  Maybe you'll remember this, Geoff.
[53:54.340 --> 53:56.540]  I brought this up to Gavin. He didn't seem to remember.
[53:56.680 --> 53:58.200]  You probably won't.
[53:58.420 --> 54:00.160]  Maybe somebody will. I will.
[54:00.280 --> 54:01.280]  Did I ever talk about that?
[54:03.140 --> 54:04.020]  That I...
[54:04.020 --> 54:05.720]  This was a very long time ago.
[54:05.940 --> 54:08.120]  That I thought that there was like an animal or something
[54:08.120 --> 54:09.940]  like I could hear stomping in like my
[54:09.940 --> 54:11.980]  rooftop. Like I thought that
[54:11.980 --> 54:14.100]  maybe there was like a... I know birds
[54:14.100 --> 54:16.340]  moved in there at one point, but I thought that maybe like a raccoon
[54:16.340 --> 54:18.060]  or something. I thought that's how you
[54:18.060 --> 54:19.880]  tricked me into listening to your farts.
[54:20.600 --> 54:21.320]  Was it?
[54:21.600 --> 54:23.600]  Yeah, that was how we got like
[54:26.040 --> 54:27.000]  birdchirp.mp3
[54:27.000 --> 54:27.480]  or whatever.
[54:27.860 --> 54:28.800]  Or birdchirp.wav
[54:29.400 --> 54:32.260]  It was clearly like a movement
[54:32.260 --> 54:34.260]  sound that would happen
[54:34.900 --> 54:35.880]  on the roof.
[54:36.460 --> 54:37.720]  And it was
[54:37.720 --> 54:40.300]  very odd. I'd never experienced anything like it.
[54:40.440 --> 54:42.000]  And then it stopped
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.940]  at around the same time the people
[54:43.940 --> 54:45.920]  that lived in the apartment
[54:45.920 --> 54:47.660]  next door moved out.
[54:47.900 --> 54:50.160]  So I thought, oh, maybe it was like sound
[54:50.160 --> 54:51.560]  because sometimes sound travels
[54:51.560 --> 54:54.060]  in like a weird way here.
[54:54.380 --> 54:56.000]  And they had kids that would
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.840]  run around, so I thought maybe it was just that.
[54:58.860 --> 54:59.800]  And then recently
[55:00.440 --> 55:02.080]  I talked to somebody else
[55:02.080 --> 55:03.280]  that lives in this building
[55:03.940 --> 55:06.500]  and I learned that it wasn't
[55:06.500 --> 55:08.040]  that. It was
[55:08.040 --> 55:10.260]  a person that lives above me
[55:10.260 --> 55:12.380]  and I guess they were known
[55:12.380 --> 55:14.260]  in the building, when they would have
[55:14.260 --> 55:16.420]  like episodes, they would
[55:16.420 --> 55:17.980]  hop out of their unit
[55:17.980 --> 55:20.620]  and land on top of mine, essentially
[55:20.620 --> 55:22.620]  and just do sprints.
[55:23.020 --> 55:24.520]  And that's how they would handle it.
[55:24.800 --> 55:26.680]  They would just sprint across
[55:26.680 --> 55:27.540]  the rooftop.
[55:28.660 --> 55:29.840]  So I had a person...
[55:29.840 --> 55:32.240]  I thought it was like an animal thing because it sounded like
[55:32.240 --> 55:34.280]  running, but there was just a person that was
[55:34.280 --> 55:36.020]  doing sprints on my roof.
[55:36.380 --> 55:38.240]  What the fuck kind of episode is that?
[55:38.240 --> 55:40.380]  Do you...
[55:40.380 --> 55:41.660]  Do you think that's what Gavin has?
[55:42.300 --> 55:44.280]  Oh! Maybe they
[55:44.280 --> 55:45.400]  moved to Austin!
[55:45.980 --> 55:47.620]  Damn it! Shit!
[55:48.640 --> 55:50.300]  Is it possible that your neighbor was
[55:50.300 --> 55:50.840]  a snake?
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.320]  Oh! I gotta check
[55:54.320 --> 55:54.840]  their tongue!
[55:56.100 --> 55:58.400]  But I thought about when it was happening
[55:58.400 --> 56:00.080]  like getting a cheap Amazon
[56:00.080 --> 56:02.480]  drone and flying it up to see
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.980]  like if I could see anything.
[56:04.220 --> 56:06.260]  I would have died! I would have had a heart attack
[56:06.260 --> 56:08.200]  if I saw just a person doing
[56:08.200 --> 56:10.540]  sprints at 2am on my roof.
[56:10.980 --> 56:12.100]  Also, a person that's in
[56:12.100 --> 56:14.260]  the mental state that requires them
[56:14.260 --> 56:16.300]  to have an episode where they
[56:16.300 --> 56:18.240]  run across a rooftop at 2 in the
[56:18.240 --> 56:20.260]  morning, you fly a drone up to that
[56:20.260 --> 56:22.040]  person, you are sending them into a
[56:22.040 --> 56:23.960]  deeper and darker down a spiral.
[56:24.160 --> 56:25.240]  You know what I mean?
[56:25.660 --> 56:28.200]  Suddenly the government really is watching them
[56:28.200 --> 56:30.380]  and yeah, it's probably safer that you didn't do that.
[56:30.560 --> 56:31.860]  Sounds like a mission in Mind's Eye.
[56:33.620 --> 56:34.440]  Other drone
[56:34.440 --> 56:35.480]  missions in Mind's Eye.
[56:36.400 --> 56:38.360]  I found a video.
[56:39.300 --> 56:40.580]  Oh, you found the feat video?
[56:40.580 --> 56:40.860]  Let's see it.
[56:41.740 --> 56:42.920]  I'm putting it in Slack.
[56:44.640 --> 56:45.980]  Okay, I'll describe
[56:47.460 --> 56:48.320]  what I'm watching.
[56:48.480 --> 56:50.640]  So Gavin is on the floor in his thing.
[56:50.840 --> 56:52.580]  He's in the position he's talked about.
[56:53.440 --> 56:54.320]  He's just...
[56:54.320 --> 56:56.040]  Yeah, it's so...
[56:56.040 --> 56:57.100]  I see.
[56:58.880 --> 57:00.500]  I totally get why she didn't
[57:00.500 --> 57:00.900]  like this.
[57:03.300 --> 57:04.100]  Oh no!
[57:04.380 --> 57:04.960]  The cats are
[57:04.960 --> 57:06.560]  investigating. They're very into it.
[57:08.520 --> 57:09.180]  So if
[57:09.180 --> 57:09.840]  you've ever
[57:10.620 --> 57:12.760]  played Hitman, from
[57:12.760 --> 57:14.740]  the waist up, he
[57:14.740 --> 57:16.740]  looks like when you're pulling a body
[57:16.740 --> 57:18.720]  in Hitman to dump them in a
[57:18.720 --> 57:19.940]  garbage can or whatever.
[57:20.460 --> 57:22.800]  But it's just him propelling himself
[57:22.800 --> 57:24.680]  forward with his legs, taking
[57:24.680 --> 57:26.800]  little steps. Can that go in the video?
[57:27.000 --> 57:28.860]  Is that safe? Yeah, let me
[57:28.860 --> 57:30.220]  do like a better crop on it.
[57:31.080 --> 57:32.600]  And I'll get you a better version.
[57:33.200 --> 57:34.900]  I think at the time I was thinking
[57:34.900 --> 57:36.920]  of me, myself, and Irene, like what
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.680]  if one of me was unconscious
[57:38.680 --> 57:39.760]  but the other one wasn't?
[57:40.460 --> 57:41.740]  And that's what I came up with.
[57:42.760 --> 57:44.280]  Crazy. God damn.
[57:45.020 --> 57:46.580]  Have you tried doing that from the...
[57:46.580 --> 57:48.360]  Could you do it reversed?
[57:49.600 --> 57:50.360]  What does that mean?
[57:50.680 --> 57:52.700]  Push instead of pull? Yeah, like
[57:52.700 --> 57:54.360]  push or pull, or maybe do like
[57:54.360 --> 57:56.600]  your arms are trying to kidnap
[57:56.600 --> 57:57.600]  everything else.
[58:00.020 --> 58:00.700]  Well, I could get
[58:00.700 --> 58:02.560]  myself in a headlock and drag myself around?
[58:03.220 --> 58:04.560]  Yeah, I don't know if the headlock is
[58:04.560 --> 58:06.200]  necessary, but just the idea of like
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.160]  legs, but arms
[58:09.040 --> 58:10.400]  going forward? I don't know.
[58:10.460 --> 58:12.600]  Well, I mean, this is my version. Maybe you should come up
[58:12.600 --> 58:13.100]  with your version.
[58:14.720 --> 58:15.260]  I'm good.
[58:20.240 --> 58:22.320]  I'm good. I'll copy you in the T-posing.
[58:22.480 --> 58:23.840]  I like that. Okay.
[58:24.440 --> 58:24.900]  That's fine.
[58:25.060 --> 58:27.640]  I had an idea, Eric, that
[58:27.640 --> 58:29.880]  isn't a funny idea, but
[58:29.880 --> 58:31.820]  I think it might be a fun idea. I don't know
[58:31.820 --> 58:32.860]  where it would fit in
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.840]  our universe, but I wanted to run it by
[58:35.840 --> 58:37.800]  you specifically. Sounds like a bench
[58:37.800 --> 58:38.460]  in San Francisco.
[58:39.860 --> 58:43.780]  I do want to have a bench in every state.
[58:44.080 --> 58:44.960]  I think that's a great idea.
[58:47.000 --> 58:47.840]  I was thinking the
[58:47.840 --> 58:49.900]  other day about how... I was reading
[58:49.900 --> 58:51.860]  an article of like if you
[58:51.860 --> 58:52.160]  were to
[58:54.280 --> 58:55.860]  draft the all-time
[58:55.860 --> 58:57.820]  best Yankees team from
[58:57.820 --> 58:59.820]  Yankees players throughout history. So if you just
[58:59.820 --> 59:01.940]  constructed the
[59:01.940 --> 59:03.980]  best Yankees team possible
[59:03.980 --> 59:06.020]  from every person
[59:06.020 --> 59:07.060]  who's ever played for the Yankees.
[59:07.620 --> 59:09.820]  And I was thinking, what if you did that
[59:09.820 --> 59:11.800]  for every team? That would be fun to see who
[59:11.800 --> 59:14.080]  the all-time... You got like Shoeless Joe Jackson
[59:14.080 --> 59:15.900]  playing on the White Sox team
[59:15.900 --> 59:17.680]  next to Robin Ventura and the
[59:17.680 --> 59:19.920]  Big Hurt. You've got
[59:19.920 --> 59:22.000]  Tatis next to Tony Gwynn or whatever
[59:22.000 --> 59:22.940]  on the Padres.
[59:24.780 --> 59:26.060]  And you create
[59:26.060 --> 59:27.880]  all 30 teams. You can do this for other
[59:27.880 --> 59:29.780]  sports too. Football, basketball, whatever.
[59:30.060 --> 59:31.820]  But you build
[59:31.820 --> 59:34.000]  out these teams that are the best possible
[59:34.000 --> 59:35.800]  team you could field from the history
[59:35.800 --> 59:37.880]  of that team. And then you
[59:37.880 --> 59:39.540]  put them in a league and sim it.
[59:39.920 --> 59:41.920]  And see who the best baseball team
[59:41.920 --> 59:43.900]  of all time is. Yeah, that's a
[59:43.900 --> 59:45.980]  great idea. It's not funny. I don't know
[59:45.980 --> 59:47.720]  that it would make like content. I mean,
[59:47.720 --> 59:49.720]  it'd have to make some kind of content. But I just think
[59:49.720 --> 59:51.560]  it would be an interesting thing to do.
[59:52.700 --> 59:53.700]  I think it's a great idea.
[59:54.020 --> 59:55.420]  I think it's
[59:55.420 --> 59:57.560]  definitely like a deceptive thing too
[59:57.560 --> 59:59.720]  where it's like who...
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:01.620]  Everyone's gonna have
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.660]  their like, oh yeah,
[01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.500]  this guy, not that guy. Because it's like
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.540]  their specific team.
[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.540]  But like, I like that idea.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.580]  I bet Nick has a lot of
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.720]  opinions about, you know, the Phillies.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.320]  Where I
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:16.620]  won't.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.280]  Like, could you imagine a
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.100]  Spurs team that has Tim
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.960]  Duncan, Manu Ginobili,
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.420]  Victor Wim Benyama,
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:27.000]  David Robinson, Tony Parker,
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.280]  all on it at the same time?
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:30.760]  Like...
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.300]  I wouldn't like
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.560]  it. You know, I don't like the Spurs.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.200]  They have such a... It's fucking crazy
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.400]  to think about. Yeah.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.160]  I like that idea. I wonder...
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.900]  We should round that idea into something.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.860]  Because I think there's something there. I like that.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.820]  Creating like the GOAT
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.180]  roster for
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.320]  every team. And then
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.800]  somehow simming them against each other.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.680]  I just don't know.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.880]  I don't know what we do with it. I used to do season
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  sims back in the old
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.920]  age days. There was a period
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.860]  where I fucked my hand up
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.900]  and I had to get surgery on it to get
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.860]  my tendons repaired. And then I had to go through like six
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.680]  months of physical therapy. And so I was in a
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.740]  cast for like three or four months
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.820]  in a row there. And the only...
[01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:14.360]  I only had one hand I could use for gaming.
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:16.360]  Because it was my
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.780]  left hand and my thumb
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.400]  that I had fucked up. And so I was useless.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.600]  And so I just made a show called
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.660]  AH Presents where I just simmed sports
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.500]  constantly. And it did okay.
[01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.440]  But I always had so much fun doing it. And I would do that.
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.880]  I'd sim like, who's better? The 72
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.080]  Milwaukee Bucks or the 86 Celtics?
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.920]  Oh, I like that. And I would just sim it to see, you know?
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.520]  We should do that.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.560]  Maybe we'll do that at the office. Maybe we'll put something together
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.660]  and see what we can do. Because I really like
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.460]  that idea. Yeah, I think it'd just be a fun and
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.440]  interesting idea. I would do
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:46.500]  the pettiest sports fan thing of all
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.580]  time where in NHL, I
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.180]  would go into be a GM mode
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.160]  and I'd pick teams I hated
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.100]  and I'd just dismantle them.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.520]  I would just give away all of
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.560]  their best assets for dogshit
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.600]  players. I'd trade away their picks.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:02.600]  And then I would just sim us
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.140]  failing miserably.
[01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.160]  And that is where I'd get my joy from.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.200]  It's just tanking this franchise
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.900]  as an incompetent GM
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.120]  that got this job. It would bring me
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.240]  so much joy. You are a true
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.800]  sports fan. Absolutely.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.240]  Yeah. I spent more time
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.220]  doing that than doing the reverse of
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.040]  taking over my favorite
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.800]  franchise and bringing them to victory.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.220]  That's fun. I've done that a
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.120]  lot, but oh, there's a special
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.300]  type of joy of getting rid of a team's
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.220]  entire assets and also
[01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.880]  a believability of
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.160]  this is what incompetence GMs
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.920]  do. I'm trading away
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.880]  Luka Doncic without any warning
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.160]  without any team knowing.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.920]  This is all believable what I'm
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:46.100]  doing, but oh, I've only
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.960]  experienced it as the fan who
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.060]  has it happen to them. It is so much
[01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:51.880]  fun to be the person that is
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.980]  making these decisions. You're like
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:56.240]  I'm Nico Harrison. I'm
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.100]  Matt Ishbia. I'm going to destroy
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.120]  this team. Oh, whoopsie.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.940]  Looks like I traded away everything
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.100]  and we suck. Oh no, I'm still
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.400]  making all my money.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.620]  We're going to bet the farm on a
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.080]  one-legged 35-year-old Kevin Durant.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.240]  Oops! We're going to get rid of Kevin Durant
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.220]  for next to nothing.
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:15.940]  By the time this is out, it'll be
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.800]  pretty dated, but
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:19.960]  I think... is it Danny Ainge
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.880]  who runs the Jazz?
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.920]  Yeah, he's the
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.020]  Jazz GM now, I believe.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:28.800]  Taking...
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.140]  the draft was last
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.380]  night at the time of this recording.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.180]  Taking Ace Bailey
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:34.560]  when
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.120]  Ace Bailey made it really clear
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.140]  I don't want to go to Utah. I don't want to play for
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.260]  the Jazz. Do not have me go here.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.220]  I don't want to do this. I won't work
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:46.320]  out with you. I don't want anything to do with you.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:48.260]  And then the Jazz going, that's great.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.220]  Welcome to the Utah Jazz is
[01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.100]  so fucking funny.
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:53.860]  That's incredible.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.120]  The Reddit comments last
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.160]  night I was watching, because I was in the car driving
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.220]  home during the draft, so I was just keeping up
[01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:01.820]  with it on Reddit, on the megathread.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.920]  And the comments were so fucking funny.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.840]  They were like, Ace Bailey, go fuck yourself.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.180]  Also, welcome to the team.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.540]  You're not a big sports guy.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.160]  Hope you like dirty soda, asshole.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.780]  Do you have a
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:15.900]  fandom that is based in suffering?
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.220]  In the way that sports is?
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.860]  Is there anything that you enjoy
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.180]  that ultimately just brings you misery?
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980]  Maybe Bond movies?
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:26.000]  Really? You think there are more
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.080]  bad Bond movies?
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:29.940]  I was trying to equate what would be his equivalent of
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.980]  sports fandom. Because Gavin
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.320]  doesn't really care about sports.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:36.080]  I don't really know what anyone said for the last five minutes,
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.820]  but I remember always getting
[01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.720]  excited for the new Bond.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.000]  It seems like the first Bond movie, the new actor is always
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.960]  great, and then it's just a steaming pile of
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.640]  sliding downhill until they change actors.
[01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.880]  You know, that's kind of how I feel about
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.820]  Mission Impossible movies. I'm always really
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:51.380]  excited for them, and then I watch it and I go,
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.800]  eh, there wasn't three.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.500]  Are you excited about
[01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.760]  Denis Villeneuve directing the next one, or no?
[01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.660]  I didn't even know.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:00.860]  Oh, really?
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:02.960]  Oh, this is how you found out? Oh my goodness.
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.160]  I'm not interested
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.180]  in stuff until I can
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:08.960]  watch or use it.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:10.960]  I've
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.040]  never enjoyed E3.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.400]  I don't like hearing about stuff that's coming out.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:16.980]  Let me know when it's ready.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.700]  You don't like anticipating things?
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.100]  No, I don't really watch trailers, if I could
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:21.960]  help it.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.100]  I get that, but the concept
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.160]  of being anti-anticipation is really
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.720]  funny. It's just too much.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.920]  I remember getting excited when they did that
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.180]  Elder Scrolls 6
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.980]  announcement, and
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:37.080]  more time has passed since that announcement
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.100]  than the time gap between Skyrim
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:39.680]  and that announcement.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.420]  Holy hell!
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.460]  I get what you're saying, but I just
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:46.720]  find it funny. The idea of, like, I don't like
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.000]  looking forward to things
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:49.900]  is the statement
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.940]  that you're making.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.540]  I'm kind of with you.
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.780]  I'm with you.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.580]  There's a nice window of it.
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:05:59.980]  For example, right now, I could
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.920]  not be more excited about a Donkey Kong game.
[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.040]  I'm so excited.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.980]  But it's only a month away. I don't want to
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:07.740]  hear about anything that's more than a month away.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.180]  Really?
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.700]  I'm kind of with you on that, though.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.940]  I could not be more excited for
[01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:14.720]  the Donkey Kong game.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:15.720]  Absolutely.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.260]  But also, I don't want to keep thinking about it,
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.260]  because I can't play it right now, and I'm frustrated
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:21.640]  that I can't play it right now.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:24.300]  I get what you're saying,
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:24.820]  but for me,
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.400]  the people that made Hitman are making that new
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.280]  James Bond game, and I just
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.740]  read a story about how
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:34.180]  there are rumors
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.120]  that that James Bond game
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.300]  will have
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.200]  elusive target-type mission-type
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.120]  things, where it's timed
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.140]  missions, and I never
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.260]  considered that. I never considered any live
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:48.260]  service aspect of that game
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.100]  sort of like Hitman has, and I'm so
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.300]  excited for that possibility.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.160]  Yeah, I just feel like being excited now doesn't do anything for me there.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.200]  You get the
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.280]  excitement now. Well, it doesn't change
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:58.960]  anything, does it?
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.380]  It brings joy to my life.
[01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:02.680]  That's what I get from it.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.280]  I'm happy about it. Gavin rejects your joy.
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:07.820]  He does. To be honest,
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:09.680]  I did go to E3 a bunch
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.640]  a decade ago, and I was
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.260]  never excited to be there.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.940]  And I love games.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.180]  Yeah, I don't...
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.520]  It's definitely... I mean, they used to have games
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.380]  on the floor, though, right? Like, there were some playable
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.040]  things, I feel like.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:24.340]  Until
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.480]  30 minutes into the show, when they broke,
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.180]  and then there'd be a sign, and they'd say,
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.260]  can you come back in a little bit later? We're working on fixing the build.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:32.660]  Interesting.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.100]  E3 sucked.
[01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.620]  I'm with you. I think it's a better format
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.600]  this way. Like, what we get now, I think
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.220]  is a better... Totally agree.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.600]  ...thing for E3.
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.520]  It was great for a time, and
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.700]  it's just... the time sort of passed, and I think that's
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:49.580]  just fine. I don't know, it's just like, the only
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.620]  thing I ever took away from them was all the things people would
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.420]  complain about. And I just
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.620]  end up just leaving an event where everyone was
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:57.620]  bitching about something. I feel like E3
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.120]  died for me when Gary Coleman did.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.720]  He was such
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.640]  a big part of E3 every year. I'd always see him
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.800]  there doing stuff. And he wasn't anymore.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.760]  Interesting tie-in. I like
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.080]  going back and re-watching E3 press conferences
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:11.880]  because you know the story of
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.760]  everything. Like how it all worked out.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.120]  Yeah. So like, games
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.020]  that you forget had a huge
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:19.820]  presentation and backing for their
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:22.100]  reveal, and then being like, oh, nobody ultimately
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.640]  played that or cared about that.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.080]  Like Evolve. Yes.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.940]  There was a string
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:29.860]  I recently re-watched, I think
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.840]  was E3 2015 for Xbox.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.980]  And it was like, Evolve
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:35.480]  Scalebound
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.940]  and a Fable multiplayer only game.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:39.980]  And it was like three games in a row that never
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.160]  came out. And they were just back to back to back.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.620]  And it was so funny watching it now.
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:45.340]  Like, oh, none of these happen.
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.320]  None of this stuff works out.
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.020]  And I think just the more I learned about that industry is
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:52.120]  I just feel
[01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.080]  like people would work on a game, it'd be like
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.060]  Crunch Central, and then they'd be cramming
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.380]  to get something out for E3
[01:08:57.820 --> 01:08:59.340]  that would end up not being in the game.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.000]  Or they physically couldn't ship
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.980]  that in the game. It's just like, why are we
[01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.840]  bothering to do this? This is just like
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.180]  pointless man-made hurdle in game development.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:09.220]  Totally.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  Good promo though. It is
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.040]  and it's like a thing where I think the way they do it now
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.020]  is so much healthier for everybody involved
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:17.860]  in that industry. But I do
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:19.880]  miss the
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.020]  absurdity of every company having to
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.640]  put on this giant event
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:26.080]  within like two hours
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.020]  of each other back to back to back to back.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.220]  Trying to outdo each other. Yes.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.400]  Fighting to rent spaces
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:33.780]  and theaters around
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.160]  San Diego or LA
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.200]  to fucking have their
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.020]  dumb events at. Like, hey, check it out!
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.200]  Cirque du Soleil is here.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.580]  Now play this video game.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.360]  Just nice having a bunch of people get together
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.200]  to try to identify like an exotic
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.660]  bird or something like that.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.200]  The fuck is
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.940]  this thing? Well,
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.420]  now that we're back around to the exotic birds,
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.260]  if this was Christopher
[01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.340]  Reeve's horse, it'd be time
[01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.380]  for Gavin to go around back and put two between
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:06.460]  its eyes. Put this baby
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.460]  to bed. Thank you for
[01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.420]  listening to another episode of
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:12.320]  the Regulation Podcast. Be on the lookout
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.600]  for some drafts in the near future
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.780]  and some gameplay videos.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.780]  Maybe we'll all
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.340]  get kidnapped by our legs and film it.
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.420]  You never know. Here on Regulation.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.140]  We'll see you next time.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:25.900]  Bye!
