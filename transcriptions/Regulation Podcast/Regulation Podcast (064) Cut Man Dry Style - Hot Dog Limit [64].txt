[00:00.000 --> 00:04.060]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:04.180 --> 00:05.440]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[00:05.600 --> 00:09.340]  And with me, as always, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Eric Bedore, Nick Schwartz.
[00:09.480 --> 00:11.820]  This is episode 64.
[00:12.260 --> 00:15.380]  I was I thought it was 63 and I was going to say, well, that's seven times nine.
[00:15.720 --> 00:17.400]  But it's not 63. It's 64.
[00:17.520 --> 00:20.380]  And I don't know what I don't know any multiplication tables for that one.
[00:20.500 --> 00:22.500]  So eight times eight. Sixty four.
[00:22.560 --> 00:23.720]  Yeah, it's eight times eight.
[00:23.900 --> 00:25.200]  Sixty four. There you go.
[00:25.980 --> 00:29.780]  Which of those dudes dicks did Imhotep take, do you think?
[00:31.080 --> 00:32.600]  Oh, 64 of them.
[00:34.060 --> 00:36.060]  Everyone has 64 dicks.
[00:36.920 --> 00:38.940]  This podcast has a weird smear to it.
[00:39.420 --> 00:41.160]  It looks like there's gel on the screen.
[00:41.300 --> 00:42.300]  Sixty four style.
[00:42.720 --> 00:44.520]  All 64 games look like shit.
[00:45.500 --> 00:46.480]  Man, gel.
[00:46.660 --> 00:47.720]  There's gel on the screen.
[00:47.820 --> 00:50.240]  Didn't know it looked like it was covered.
[00:50.360 --> 00:53.640]  Like the screen look kind of like fuzzy, you know, like a weird way,
[00:53.720 --> 00:56.880]  like somebody smeared something on the screen, like Vaseline on the lens.
[00:57.040 --> 00:58.720]  Sure. Some Vaseline on the lens.
[00:58.720 --> 00:59.880]  There you go.
[01:00.160 --> 01:02.160]  It's an ugly daytime TV style.
[01:02.540 --> 01:03.680]  What a strange walk.
[01:03.900 --> 01:04.660]  We just went on a straight.
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.340]  What a strange walk that Gavin started.
[01:06.480 --> 01:09.180]  And then Andrew just sort of grabbed and he went and we're going this way now.
[01:10.100 --> 01:13.560]  Screamer Scream 4 also heavily Vaseline for some reason.
[01:14.320 --> 01:14.960]  Scream 4?
[01:15.540 --> 01:16.980]  Yeah, it just looks like shit.
[01:17.540 --> 01:19.820]  Did you just watch Scream 4?
[01:20.300 --> 01:23.000]  No, just remembered it being very Vaseline-y.
[01:23.500 --> 01:27.040]  Really? Well, that one, they're like using weird cameras, aren't they?
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.520]  Like they're doing like shoulder cam and like webcam stuff in it.
[01:31.060 --> 01:31.680]  Vaseline cam.
[01:32.140 --> 01:36.620]  If you want to see some of the best Vaseline work in the history of Hollywood,
[01:36.760 --> 01:39.880]  let me recommend season seven of the TV show Dallas.
[01:40.280 --> 01:43.700]  That was when I think everybody was too old and alcoholic
[01:43.700 --> 01:45.560]  and bloated to fake it anymore.
[01:45.780 --> 01:49.420]  And they were like, we just got to slather on the petroleum jelly
[01:49.420 --> 01:53.420]  because it is getting obvious that these people are aging faster
[01:53.420 --> 01:56.660]  than our story wants the audience to believe.
[01:57.040 --> 02:00.320]  You ever just smear a big thing of Vaseline over your face?
[02:01.180 --> 02:02.360]  No. Your eyebrow or something?
[02:02.560 --> 02:03.260]  Yeah, I'm wearing it right now.
[02:03.840 --> 02:04.500]  Oh, that's nice.
[02:04.820 --> 02:06.600]  I just I see it all the time in fights.
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.900]  Like cut men are always smeared in Vaseline on faces.
[02:10.060 --> 02:11.340]  And I always wonder what that feels like.
[02:11.420 --> 02:14.780]  Is that just straight up Vaseline or is it some sort of like homebrew mix?
[02:15.180 --> 02:16.620]  No, I'm pretty sure it's just Vaseline.
[02:17.120 --> 02:18.260]  But it's just Vaseline.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.940]  It's just trying to hold the cut.
[02:21.320 --> 02:23.380]  Yeah, it's just to prevent friction.
[02:23.460 --> 02:25.680]  Like when you get hit and hopefully you're
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.240]  hopefully getting the boxing glove to slide right off of your eyebrow
[02:29.240 --> 02:30.960]  that just got hit so, so hard.
[02:31.240 --> 02:32.460]  What if you pre-Vaseline then?
[02:32.560 --> 02:34.100]  What if you just pre...
[02:34.100 --> 02:34.620]  That's illegal.
[02:35.140 --> 02:36.220]  Not allowed to do that.
[02:37.400 --> 02:40.940]  But that is a thing that people will do is they'll like coat themselves
[02:41.480 --> 02:44.740]  in Vaseline or lotion prior to the fight.
[02:44.820 --> 02:48.920]  So their body absorbs it and then they sweat it out and become super slippery.
[02:49.220 --> 02:53.340]  We should rent one of those punch glove machines to see who has the hardest punch
[02:53.340 --> 02:55.140]  and all take a go punching it.
[02:55.140 --> 02:58.040]  And then we Vaseline it and have another go.
[02:58.900 --> 03:01.980]  Then we go to the minor emergency when somebody breaks a knuckle.
[03:02.640 --> 03:03.900]  Can I ask you guys a question about Vaseline?
[03:04.280 --> 03:04.800]  Of course.
[03:05.480 --> 03:06.760]  Well, let me ask you two questions.
[03:07.120 --> 03:10.000]  One, is Vaseline the brand or the product?
[03:10.140 --> 03:11.340]  It's petroleum jelly, right?
[03:11.460 --> 03:13.340]  And is Vaseline just the company or the product?
[03:13.420 --> 03:13.860]  I think it's the brand.
[03:14.380 --> 03:15.700]  Yeah, but it's clean.
[03:15.800 --> 03:17.640]  It's like Kleenex, right? Like tissue.
[03:17.780 --> 03:24.160]  Yeah, yeah, it's just become synonymous with the product.
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.420]  The other question is, when I was a kid growing up, everybody always talked about
[03:28.420 --> 03:30.340]  like it was always like you jerk off with Vaseline.
[03:30.620 --> 03:31.900]  I've never done that.
[03:32.380 --> 03:34.260]  That seems like such a mess.
[03:34.360 --> 03:36.180]  I guess we got to try it on the show, man.
[03:37.460 --> 03:39.700]  I don't want to jerk off on the show.
[03:40.140 --> 03:44.520]  It's all you circumcised freaks who need that lube.
[03:46.640 --> 03:47.120]  What?
[03:48.260 --> 03:53.340]  That's just lobbing her grenade and four guys watching it land.
[03:53.340 --> 03:55.780]  It's all your circumcised.
[03:55.780 --> 03:56.800]  I was just trying to understand.
[03:56.980 --> 03:57.460]  OK, sorry.
[03:57.560 --> 04:00.840]  If you're munking off, you can't just munk off dry.
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.040]  I mean, sure.
[04:02.620 --> 04:07.300]  Yeah, but I think that the idea is that munking off dry is probably not as
[04:08.620 --> 04:12.400]  fun or as similar to the experience of having intercourse,
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.980]  you know, where it's typically not dry skin rubbing against dry skin.
[04:17.020 --> 04:19.800]  So I think it's like a dry rub.
[04:19.860 --> 04:20.720]  Yeah, it's like a brisket.
[04:20.720 --> 04:23.880]  Yeah, but that's what the foreskin is for, like easing it in and out.
[04:24.660 --> 04:27.440]  I'm just imagining a bunch of monks eating brisket
[04:27.440 --> 04:30.320]  and you bringing foreskin and really it's thrown up my visual.
[04:31.520 --> 04:32.620]  I thought title.
[04:33.040 --> 04:36.300]  I'm so excited to write this title Cut Man Dry Style.
[04:40.340 --> 04:43.640]  I don't know, I just think I think circumcision was a bad idea.
[04:44.320 --> 04:45.140]  Take it up with God.
[04:45.240 --> 04:46.240]  I don't think that's controversial.
[04:46.940 --> 04:49.040]  Yeah, I don't think there's anything controversial about that either.
[04:49.040 --> 04:51.640]  I think circumcision is on its way out culturally.
[04:52.340 --> 04:57.020]  But for many of us who were born at a time when it wasn't,
[04:57.180 --> 04:58.400]  we just dealing with it.
[04:58.700 --> 05:01.360]  You know, I've been short in circumcision for years.
[05:01.360 --> 05:02.560]  I'm ready for the collapse.
[05:02.900 --> 05:06.540]  I'm calling on the Michael Burry of circumcision.
[05:06.640 --> 05:09.020]  Yeah, he's short in GameStop and circumcision.
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.560]  Any day now, he's going to be fucking loaded.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.640]  Oh, big money.
[05:12.120 --> 05:13.520]  Diamond hands. Let's go.
[05:16.120 --> 05:18.480]  If if the if the circumcised,
[05:18.480 --> 05:21.940]  if the regulation crew could buy back a foreskin,
[05:22.020 --> 05:23.160]  how much would you put down for it?
[05:23.760 --> 05:25.420]  Zero. You wouldn't want one?
[05:26.880 --> 05:31.900]  No. Dude, I've made it 50 fucking years with a bald dome, dude.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.020]  I'm pretty. I'm doing OK.
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.500]  I guess I don't need to put a hat on it.
[05:36.640 --> 05:38.200]  Not this late in the game.
[05:38.460 --> 05:41.400]  I'd say you could get injections and you could regrow it.
[05:42.060 --> 05:43.560]  You wouldn't you wouldn't consider it.
[05:43.920 --> 05:45.120]  OK, there is.
[05:45.260 --> 05:47.960]  I've heard this on on the Howard Stern show in the past.
[05:47.960 --> 05:51.000]  There is a procedure you can do where they stretch.
[05:51.200 --> 05:54.140]  If you have enough skin, they can stretch it and pull it and kind of create.
[05:54.480 --> 05:57.900]  Oh, God, we create your no, your foreskin.
[05:58.060 --> 05:59.460]  And it sounds brutal.
[05:59.860 --> 06:04.800]  I will say one time I heard it was during that segment.
[06:05.060 --> 06:08.520]  Some guy called in the Howard Stern show and said that he got his
[06:08.520 --> 06:11.100]  foreskin cut off as an adult,
[06:11.980 --> 06:15.280]  like he had a foreskin his entire life and then like had a wife
[06:15.280 --> 06:16.860]  or a girlfriend or somebody who was not into it.
[06:16.860 --> 06:18.040]  And he was like, fuck it, I'll just cut it off.
[06:18.280 --> 06:21.100]  And he cut it off and said his life got so much better.
[06:21.180 --> 06:22.800]  Instantly, sex felt better.
[06:23.100 --> 06:24.300]  It was easier to clean.
[06:24.440 --> 06:25.560]  Going to the bathroom was easier.
[06:25.620 --> 06:28.400]  And he was like, I would never in a million years take a foreskin again.
[06:28.620 --> 06:32.440]  And I'm going to trust that one stranger on a radio show
[06:32.440 --> 06:36.240]  who I don't know and who could have been lying because it makes me feel better
[06:36.240 --> 06:37.340]  about my situation.
[06:37.460 --> 06:41.120]  That guy was a plant for a definite plan for big foreskin.
[06:41.440 --> 06:45.540]  Big circumcision is a reverse big cut.
[06:46.260 --> 06:46.980]  Big cut.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.920]  I don't want to hear that propaganda while I'm shorting.
[06:51.420 --> 06:52.080]  I don't know, man.
[06:52.180 --> 06:52.720]  Get out of here.
[06:52.900 --> 06:54.860]  Life's pretty easy without a foreskin.
[06:55.420 --> 06:56.580]  Life's pretty easy with a foreskin.
[06:56.940 --> 06:57.480]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[06:57.640 --> 06:59.820]  And it just there's no friction.
[07:00.620 --> 07:03.700]  Yeah, but if you've made it this far in life, why would you need to change it?
[07:04.700 --> 07:07.340]  I think sometimes, you know, you want to try a new pair of shoes.
[07:08.040 --> 07:10.180]  OK, well, why don't you cut your foreskin off and then let us know?
[07:10.720 --> 07:11.340]  That's too permanent.
[07:11.560 --> 07:13.100]  Easier than us adding a foreskin.
[07:13.100 --> 07:16.120]  It's way easier for you guys to subtract than for us to add.
[07:16.340 --> 07:19.220]  So if we want to get to the bottom of it, maybe that's the angle we take.
[07:19.560 --> 07:22.140]  I just want a fantasy world where you could like inject yourself
[07:22.140 --> 07:23.660]  with something and it naturally grows back.
[07:24.060 --> 07:24.720]  That'd be fun.
[07:24.900 --> 07:28.240]  Oh, I'll only cut mine off if it gets put on someone else.
[07:29.520 --> 07:32.900]  You know how like people are going to Turkey to get hair replacement done,
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.080]  like that's the place to get.
[07:34.220 --> 07:35.780]  Yeah, those big old turkey teeth.
[07:36.080 --> 07:38.920]  Yeah. Could you get like back hair replacement?
[07:39.120 --> 07:40.400]  Like, could you put hair anywhere?
[07:40.600 --> 07:42.760]  What's the restriction on where you can put hair?
[07:43.900 --> 07:46.820]  Oh, I mean, anywhere there was a follicle, right?
[07:46.880 --> 07:47.780]  Could put a new one.
[07:47.960 --> 07:48.980]  I assume, right?
[07:49.580 --> 07:52.040]  It just I've never heard anyone getting back hair.
[07:52.280 --> 07:55.800]  I don't know if we ever talked about it, but when I came back from Turkey,
[07:55.900 --> 07:57.140]  you know, I flew back from Turkey.
[07:57.560 --> 08:01.160]  Yeah. There were probably eight dudes on the plane who had
[08:02.400 --> 08:03.600]  had the surgery.
[08:03.640 --> 08:06.800]  They were all they were all peppered around and
[08:07.440 --> 08:12.480]  they just had red, angry heads with like little black hairs popping out
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.700]  and their head just looked like just looked like a bruised testicle.
[08:16.920 --> 08:18.600]  It was just it was brutal.
[08:18.740 --> 08:20.980]  And they just all looked so fucking miserable.
[08:20.980 --> 08:23.860]  But they all had bloody hairy heads.
[08:23.980 --> 08:26.360]  So I guess it will look fine eventually, right?
[08:26.540 --> 08:29.200]  Yeah, I guess in six months from now, they'll probably be the happiest dudes
[08:29.200 --> 08:30.940]  on earth. But man, they looked miserable on the plane.
[08:31.360 --> 08:32.220]  I'm going to have to do it one day.
[08:32.620 --> 08:34.580]  Yeah. Yeah. That's what my flight looked like.
[08:34.580 --> 08:35.660]  Yeah. Just a bunch of dudes.
[08:36.280 --> 08:36.680]  Yeah.
[08:37.400 --> 08:38.540]  Gavin, I'll go with you.
[08:38.940 --> 08:41.580]  Like, I don't necessarily like need it, but like
[08:41.580 --> 08:43.320]  I get like a lower hairline.
[08:43.440 --> 08:46.980]  Imagine if I came back and just had like a really forward hairline.
[08:48.340 --> 08:52.460]  Like just just dialing it back and just having it go like, oh, yeah,
[08:53.240 --> 08:56.060]  forward two inches, like it's like way down my forehead.
[08:56.200 --> 08:56.880]  That'd be cool.
[08:57.440 --> 08:59.620]  I got plenty on my back, plenty on my chest.
[08:59.620 --> 09:03.280]  I've got plenty like even high up my cheeks, like my
[09:03.280 --> 09:05.740]  my beard stops right under my eyes.
[09:07.000 --> 09:08.340]  It's just not where I need it.
[09:08.340 --> 09:11.620]  Do you think they could take any hair from anywhere and then put it on your head?
[09:11.680 --> 09:13.220]  Or does it have to be from like the back of your head?
[09:13.280 --> 09:14.420]  Like it's like that kind of situation.
[09:15.200 --> 09:17.200]  You think you could give up like some back hair?
[09:17.860 --> 09:18.840]  Back of the neck, isn't it?
[09:18.880 --> 09:22.680]  Usually you could have a head that's partially like head hair,
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.600]  pubic hair and back hair.
[09:25.180 --> 09:27.860]  You'd just be like, man, oh, do you think you could get animal?
[09:29.420 --> 09:32.300]  Oh, like a lion, like get like half a lion's mane.
[09:32.860 --> 09:36.260]  Oh, imagine seeing someone who had a head of hair from a sloth.
[09:36.260 --> 09:37.520]  Yeah. Yes.
[09:37.640 --> 09:38.720]  Sloth head. Yeah.
[09:39.020 --> 09:40.940]  Oh, you could have you could have shmi hair.
[09:41.140 --> 09:42.820]  You could get a bunch of hair from your cat.
[09:43.580 --> 09:46.940]  Oh, and then and then and then you go home and you go, I'm like you.
[09:47.100 --> 09:47.740]  I'm like you.
[09:48.200 --> 09:49.560]  And I'll get a hunger for flesh.
[09:50.740 --> 09:54.180]  Yeah. I wonder what animal has the most human like hair.
[09:54.620 --> 09:56.200]  Huh? Huh.
[09:56.760 --> 09:59.420]  I bet there's like a like a dog that has human hair.
[09:59.780 --> 10:01.380]  It like Nick's dog has people eyes.
[10:01.680 --> 10:05.000]  Oh, yeah. What about what are feathers?
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.260]  Yeah, I saw a real fucked up looking bird recently, but I don't know what it was.
[10:11.560 --> 10:15.120]  That that would be great if you could just select from a list and be like,
[10:15.200 --> 10:16.740]  dude, I love your new hair. Where'd you get it?
[10:16.780 --> 10:17.920]  And like, oh, it's golden retriever.
[10:17.940 --> 10:19.900]  And they're like, yeah, it's fucking shows. It's beautiful.
[10:20.620 --> 10:22.780]  What about you? Oh, I went with German shepherd.
[10:22.900 --> 10:23.940]  I like it. Yeah, it's good.
[10:24.300 --> 10:28.420]  What if you instead of taxidermy for your favorite pet, you just get them on you?
[10:28.820 --> 10:30.240]  That sounds horrendous.
[10:31.180 --> 10:34.820]  Like what if I just had, oh, I just grossed myself out.
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.740]  What if I had Smee on my back?
[10:37.260 --> 10:41.380]  Yeah. Like I fill in my bald spot with a little bit of Henry. Yeah.
[10:43.280 --> 10:45.540]  Oh, I hate this idea. Why?
[10:46.100 --> 10:50.100]  The premise of like you're having to shave your animal for their hair.
[10:50.500 --> 10:51.400]  No, they've died.
[10:52.060 --> 10:55.160]  Well, when they die, you they don't grow hair back.
[10:55.240 --> 10:56.200]  You're going to run out of hair.
[10:56.620 --> 10:59.160]  Well, you're taking the follicles out near the fur follicles.
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.400]  Yeah. But I assume that do they not go away?
[11:03.400 --> 11:05.820]  I'm not just gluing hairballs to my back.
[11:06.960 --> 11:09.940]  Huh? Do they not go away?
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.960]  What do you mean that I assume that they would when the cat dies?
[11:13.880 --> 11:15.160]  Well, maybe you might have to get.
[11:15.340 --> 11:17.340]  I assume you need a refill is my point.
[11:17.480 --> 11:21.120]  And that's your your animal is going to die at some point.
[11:21.880 --> 11:24.860]  Yeah. I don't think I'd want to take its follicles before it died.
[11:25.700 --> 11:29.420]  Interesting. So you'd want to like wait for it to die naturally
[11:29.420 --> 11:31.420]  and then immediately rush into the OR.
[11:31.560 --> 11:32.820]  Yeah, yeah. So it dies.
[11:32.820 --> 11:34.320]  Yeah. And then I harvest.
[11:34.500 --> 11:38.700]  See, I see that this is the confusion I was thinking more like a wig type scenario
[11:38.700 --> 11:42.980]  where you're just shaving the hair and then shoving it in your own head,
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.240]  as opposed to you're talking about the follicle.
[11:45.440 --> 11:47.660]  I don't think when you go to Turkey, they just shave off
[11:47.660 --> 11:49.540]  some of your head and plug it in.
[11:49.600 --> 11:50.800]  No, I don't think they do that in Turkey.
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.900]  But I think that's what hair transplant surgery originally was.
[11:54.280 --> 11:55.700]  Was it not? What?
[11:55.800 --> 11:59.080]  Gluing hair? Not gluing hair, but like inserting hair.
[11:59.660 --> 12:03.620]  That's why you'd have to reset it like every few years or like,
[12:04.140 --> 12:04.740]  I don't know.
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.700]  I was always under the impression that you need the follicle put in.
[12:07.860 --> 12:08.800]  I don't know.
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.180]  I would go 100% bald before trying any of this.
[12:13.460 --> 12:14.560]  Yeah. In reality.
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.360]  I would just tattoo like a big spider web on my head and pretend I was tough.
[12:19.740 --> 12:20.840]  Oh, that's cool.
[12:21.860 --> 12:25.400]  I wonder if there's anyone who's bald, who is considering going to Turkey,
[12:25.400 --> 12:29.360]  but is not because they don't want people to assume why they're going there.
[12:29.700 --> 12:31.440]  Like they just want to visit Turkey.
[12:31.580 --> 12:33.760]  They don't want the transplant surgery, but they're bald.
[12:33.900 --> 12:36.140]  So they know everyone will assume that that's why they're going.
[12:36.540 --> 12:37.780]  And so they just haven't gone.
[12:38.320 --> 12:39.440]  They don't want to deal with that.
[12:39.740 --> 12:42.680]  That's why I tried to be very clear that I was going on a cruise
[12:42.680 --> 12:44.260]  that happened to end in Turkey.
[12:44.340 --> 12:47.160]  I was not going to Turkey because I didn't want anybody to think
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.200]  I was like trying to sneak back in with a new hairline.
[12:50.480 --> 12:51.740]  I don't think I've ever seen.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  I don't think there's any shame in it.
[12:53.280 --> 12:54.120]  No, no shame.
[12:54.120 --> 12:57.460]  But I've never seen a result that I went, oh, that was worth it.
[12:58.060 --> 12:59.580]  I just don't think you've seen the best work.
[12:59.740 --> 13:00.580]  Oh, I don't know.
[13:00.720 --> 13:02.800]  Joel McHale is a pretty good example.
[13:03.180 --> 13:04.820]  You ever seen that dude before his hair transplant?
[13:05.400 --> 13:08.420]  I just don't like I think it's more of just a personal thing
[13:08.420 --> 13:09.240]  where it's like, I don't care.
[13:09.440 --> 13:10.280]  It doesn't matter.
[13:10.700 --> 13:12.400]  Look at Steve Carell's head in series.
[13:12.500 --> 13:14.240]  What are the offers compared to series two?
[13:14.340 --> 13:16.020]  No kidding. No kidding. It's night and day.
[13:16.140 --> 13:20.100]  I don't know if they like sabotaged his hair for the first one, but wow.
[13:20.200 --> 13:21.160]  Joel McHale looks great.
[13:21.660 --> 13:22.640]  Yeah, he looks fantastic.
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.240]  He's an example of why you would get a hair transplant.
[13:25.540 --> 13:26.040]  It changed.
[13:26.220 --> 13:31.320]  It changed him from a nerdy dude to a good looking dude instantly.
[13:31.900 --> 13:36.500]  I guess when I've seen like TikToks of people being like, I went to Turkey
[13:36.500 --> 13:37.260]  and did the thing.
[13:37.420 --> 13:39.560]  Well, here's my month by month update.
[13:39.880 --> 13:40.920]  Yeah. What do you expect?
[13:41.260 --> 13:43.260]  What is he? Here's a Hollywood actor.
[13:43.560 --> 13:45.340]  I saw some TikToks.
[13:46.620 --> 13:48.540]  We're talking about the best work here, bud.
[13:48.920 --> 13:51.080]  We're not talking about like some guys that went.
[13:51.080 --> 13:53.700]  I feel like Turkey's the number one place now,
[13:53.720 --> 13:55.720]  but I don't know what I'm talking about.
[13:56.240 --> 13:57.660]  No. I don't think any of us really do.
[13:58.840 --> 14:01.520]  I don't think any of us have researched this extensively.
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.680]  Zero research.
[14:04.200 --> 14:06.380]  Yes. I think people go to Turkey because it's cheap.
[14:06.740 --> 14:08.780]  Yeah. And I think they're good doctors there, too.
[14:08.840 --> 14:12.120]  Let me just tell you, after being in Turkey, it's awesome.
[14:12.260 --> 14:13.640]  I would go to Turkey for a lot of stuff.
[14:13.740 --> 14:14.600]  Turkey's just cool.
[14:14.680 --> 14:15.880]  And the people in Turkey are cool.
[14:16.500 --> 14:19.640]  And if you told me they had the best doctors in the world in Turkey, I'd go,
[14:19.640 --> 14:21.560]  I believe it. It's a pretty cool fucking town.
[14:21.700 --> 14:23.700]  It's a big city. Like I, I get it.
[14:24.040 --> 14:25.240]  I think Turkey's just rad.
[14:25.860 --> 14:27.920]  Yeah. I've heard nothing but good things.
[14:28.340 --> 14:30.620]  Mainly from you, but nothing but good things.
[14:32.820 --> 14:34.780]  Andrew, I need a mental image update.
[14:35.100 --> 14:35.840]  Still got the long hair?
[14:36.520 --> 14:38.220]  Yeah, it's too long. I need to get it.
[14:38.600 --> 14:39.440]  Still got the beard?
[14:40.060 --> 14:40.220]  Yeah.
[14:40.840 --> 14:42.740]  And how's the coverage on the head? Is it good?
[14:43.180 --> 14:43.600]  It's fine.
[14:44.160 --> 14:47.460]  OK. Would you be going if you if you went for some plugs,
[14:47.460 --> 14:50.480]  would they be on the top or sort of on the receding line?
[14:52.340 --> 14:54.140]  Ah, I guess top, right?
[14:54.380 --> 14:54.980]  You want top?
[14:55.560 --> 14:57.120]  Yeah, I think that's where I would need it.
[14:57.700 --> 14:58.340]  Yeah. Yeah.
[14:58.520 --> 15:01.880]  Like in the male pattern, baldness section would be at the crown, probably.
[15:02.220 --> 15:04.220]  Yeah, the crown. That's a good way to say it.
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.480]  I would definitely need a hairline.
[15:06.900 --> 15:10.180]  Like my hairline is definitely receded over the years.
[15:11.120 --> 15:12.000]  It's retreating.
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.700]  Bunch of cowards.
[15:14.420 --> 15:15.340]  Hold the line.
[15:15.560 --> 15:17.300]  It's like, hold the line, hold the line.
[15:17.400 --> 15:18.020]  We can win this.
[15:18.180 --> 15:20.980]  And it's like, no, no, we don't have enough reinforcements.
[15:21.160 --> 15:22.840]  The war's already lost.
[15:24.760 --> 15:25.760]  Pack it in, boys.
[15:26.640 --> 15:28.240]  I would get a beard.
[15:28.500 --> 15:29.680]  Do you think they'd let me do beard?
[15:31.240 --> 15:32.540]  Get like beard hair transplant?
[15:32.620 --> 15:34.160]  What about like grizzly bear beard?
[15:34.500 --> 15:35.580]  I think that would be that.
[15:35.720 --> 15:38.620]  I mean, I just I can't grow a beard like at all.
[15:38.760 --> 15:41.840]  So I'm just like, can you do hair transplant on face?
[15:42.440 --> 15:43.140]  I don't know.
[15:43.140 --> 15:44.380]  I would assume so.
[15:44.700 --> 15:44.820]  Right.
[15:45.140 --> 15:48.900]  I mean, I bet just some hormones would kick a good beard out.
[15:49.440 --> 15:52.360]  Oh, what if I started doing like steroids?
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:54.840 --> 15:57.720]  What kind of beard did Jose Canseco grow?
[15:59.540 --> 16:01.260]  Big, big until none at all.
[16:01.600 --> 16:03.760]  If you could safely do steroids, would you do steroids?
[16:05.260 --> 16:06.080]  For what?
[16:06.980 --> 16:07.780]  What do you mean?
[16:08.740 --> 16:09.160]  What do you mean?
[16:09.160 --> 16:10.680]  For its purpose.
[16:11.300 --> 16:12.260]  To get like yoked?
[16:12.260 --> 16:13.240]  Yeah, why not?
[16:13.320 --> 16:14.120]  I mean, it helps with that.
[16:14.160 --> 16:15.100]  It helps with recovery.
[16:15.620 --> 16:16.840]  Yeah, you'll have to do shit.
[16:17.480 --> 16:21.460]  I think I'd rather just like put an EPO tent on my bed
[16:21.460 --> 16:23.000]  and just sleep in an EPO tent.
[16:23.380 --> 16:24.680]  An EPO tent?
[16:25.420 --> 16:29.240]  Yeah, like it raises your your blood levels or something.
[16:29.360 --> 16:31.000]  It's what Lance Armstrong was doing.
[16:31.700 --> 16:32.780]  He was also doing steroids.
[16:33.200 --> 16:36.460]  Armstrong was also doing a little bit more than a lot of Lance Armstrong.
[16:36.600 --> 16:37.020]  He's doing a lot.
[16:37.080 --> 16:40.840]  But like doing a tent to raise your EPO, I believe is what it is.
[16:40.840 --> 16:44.040]  That was so disappointing because he had the coolest commercial
[16:44.040 --> 16:47.240]  in the history of sports commercials where it was like him training.
[16:47.460 --> 16:50.080]  And he was like, people keep asking me, what are you on?
[16:50.180 --> 16:52.460]  And he's like, I'm on my bike eight hours a day.
[16:52.520 --> 16:53.600]  And I was like, oh, it's tough.
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.920]  And he's like, but also I'm on a shitload of steroids.
[16:56.020 --> 16:56.820]  They just haven't caught me yet.
[16:57.100 --> 16:58.960]  Yeah, I'm just doing like a bunch of trend also.
[16:59.160 --> 17:00.620]  So, you know, figure it out.
[17:00.960 --> 17:02.100]  And an EPO tent.
[17:02.900 --> 17:03.500]  What am I on?
[17:03.540 --> 17:06.140]  I'm on my bike eight hours a day and I'm on a flight to Turkey.
[17:08.860 --> 17:11.000]  I just don't think I'd have.
[17:11.880 --> 17:13.060]  Oh, maybe I don't know.
[17:13.940 --> 17:16.860]  I guess I don't think I'd use steroids to get jacked.
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.600]  It would just be more like injury recovery.
[17:19.260 --> 17:20.260]  How much are you getting injured?
[17:20.620 --> 17:22.200]  What's your percent right now for ankles?
[17:22.780 --> 17:24.500]  Oh, 100 percent. Ankles are all good.
[17:25.320 --> 17:26.380]  My shoulder is fucked.
[17:26.560 --> 17:29.340]  But so you wouldn't see it as like a like you would use.
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.220]  You wouldn't see it as steroids being like a consistent thing.
[17:33.240 --> 17:34.380]  You would only use them.
[17:35.260 --> 17:39.640]  To recover from stepping on a sushi container or whatever.
[17:39.800 --> 17:40.660]  Yes. Yeah.
[17:41.100 --> 17:45.040]  And we're in a we're talking in a world where like there's no negatives to steroid usage.
[17:45.340 --> 17:50.460]  Well, you know, one of the positives to steroid usage, I think that I wasn't always a positive.
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.740]  But now later in life, I wouldn't mind is I doesn't it shrink your balls?
[17:54.200 --> 17:56.980]  I could use the older I get, the more they sag.
[17:57.060 --> 17:59.760]  You know, like I could use a little ball shrinkage at 50.
[17:59.940 --> 18:00.960]  You got long balls.
[18:01.380 --> 18:02.280]  I got long balls.
[18:02.280 --> 18:03.420]  I didn't think you'd bring them in.
[18:03.480 --> 18:04.420]  It would just make him little.
[18:04.780 --> 18:06.920]  Yeah, but then maybe they wouldn't swing as much, you know?
[18:09.540 --> 18:10.980]  The pendulum would be smaller.
[18:12.160 --> 18:13.280]  Andrew, how'd you hurt your shoulder?
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.280]  Was it a sleeping injury?
[18:14.940 --> 18:17.720]  I've had a fucked up shoulder for like 15 years.
[18:18.040 --> 18:20.860]  I think I have like a rotator cuff injury.
[18:22.180 --> 18:23.540]  Well, definitely take steroids.
[18:25.320 --> 18:27.660]  Yeah, I think I might need surgery on it or something.
[18:27.720 --> 18:28.820]  I don't know. I guess it doesn't.
[18:28.920 --> 18:31.700]  If it's a rotator cuff, you know, it doesn't naturally heal.
[18:31.700 --> 18:34.800]  But I'm not entirely sure what a rotator cuff is.
[18:35.420 --> 18:37.440]  Yeah, there's like a million things in the shoulder.
[18:37.740 --> 18:38.260]  I have no idea.
[18:38.620 --> 18:41.780]  If you're going to get a rotator cuff surgery, you might as well
[18:41.780 --> 18:44.320]  go ahead and get Tommy John surgery at the same time.
[18:44.480 --> 18:47.240]  Preventative, like some baseball players are doing just in case.
[18:47.480 --> 18:49.020]  I'm going to knock it all out. I'm going to get that.
[18:49.120 --> 18:51.520]  I'm going to get the hips done for like what goalies do.
[18:52.200 --> 18:52.560]  Precautionary.
[18:53.040 --> 18:55.760]  I'm going to get my wisdom teeth removed at the same time.
[18:55.800 --> 18:56.480]  We're just doing it all.
[18:56.780 --> 18:57.780]  Oh yeah, appendix.
[18:58.280 --> 19:00.160]  Yeah, I think that's gone already.
[19:00.160 --> 19:02.260]  Oh, pretty sure that's gone.
[19:02.740 --> 19:05.640]  Oh, do you have appendicitis at some point?
[19:06.100 --> 19:08.900]  I think I was just I had to have stomach surgery
[19:08.900 --> 19:11.240]  and I think they just got rid of it at that time.
[19:11.620 --> 19:13.820]  Yeah, you got some gut out, didn't you at some point?
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.480]  I did. Yeah, I got some intestine removed.
[19:17.420 --> 19:18.380]  Oh, lucky.
[19:19.160 --> 19:22.220]  Well, a little short on my test.
[19:22.320 --> 19:23.880]  Long back. Short intestine.
[19:24.380 --> 19:27.420]  Think about getting getting getting your intestine shortened, though.
[19:27.420 --> 19:31.400]  Like I might have to do something similar someday with my butthole,
[19:31.540 --> 19:34.500]  you know, because the diverticulitis and it's like people worry about that.
[19:34.580 --> 19:36.460]  But you think about you've got so much bundled up in there.
[19:36.560 --> 19:38.740]  If you get a little bit cut out, it's got to just make things
[19:38.740 --> 19:39.980]  a little more efficient, right?
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.640]  Is that less less distance to travel through it?
[19:42.860 --> 19:43.360]  It's crazy.
[19:43.500 --> 19:47.380]  I assume not considering evolution of that exact length.
[19:48.140 --> 19:51.680]  Hmm. Yeah, I think I think I think it all just got stuffed in there
[19:51.680 --> 19:52.420]  and was like good enough.
[19:54.580 --> 19:58.120]  I feel like with intestine, it's crazy how long it is.
[19:58.500 --> 20:02.000]  And just frustrating knowing like when I can't reach something,
[20:02.140 --> 20:06.320]  thinking that there's so much length in me that I just can't use pointless length.
[20:06.720 --> 20:09.820]  It's like you're plastic, man, but it's all trapped inside.
[20:10.340 --> 20:13.300]  Yeah. It's like Russian dolls, but it's shitty.
[20:15.000 --> 20:18.080]  I just got back from roughly two weeks away from home.
[20:18.200 --> 20:19.000]  Missed you guys, by the way.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.580]  I was very excited to come and record with you today
[20:21.580 --> 20:23.280]  because we haven't done a podcast in a little bit.
[20:23.660 --> 20:26.400]  Didn't expect to be talking about hair transplants for the first 20 minutes,
[20:26.480 --> 20:27.560]  but that was cool.
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.300]  But I do have one funny little story.
[20:30.360 --> 20:30.980]  I was gone for two weeks.
[20:31.060 --> 20:34.460]  Not much happened on my trip, but I did have one funny little minor story
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.780]  I would love to share with you guys.
[20:35.980 --> 20:38.480]  Please. I have a question for you once you're done.
[20:38.860 --> 20:42.420]  Absolutely. Got up to gross point in Detroit area, you know, staying with the in-laws.
[20:42.600 --> 20:44.300]  Did some did some house hunting.
[20:44.400 --> 20:47.680]  The whole deal didn't find a house, narrowed it down to where I want to live,
[20:47.680 --> 20:49.460]  though, if we end up buying a house up there someday.
[20:50.300 --> 20:53.760]  However, one of the cool things we did do is, you know, I'm a big e-bike rider,
[20:54.460 --> 20:58.000]  but it's a whole thing to move the e-bikes up with us,
[20:58.200 --> 21:00.700]  you know, in the car on a three day journey.
[21:01.320 --> 21:04.100]  And so it's something we've always discussed is if we spend enough time in Michigan,
[21:04.180 --> 21:07.280]  maybe someday it would make sense just to buy e-bikes and have two sets.
[21:07.440 --> 21:08.600]  And so while we were up there this time,
[21:08.760 --> 21:11.620]  I said, fuck it and pulled the trigger and did it and bought a couple of cheap e-bikes.
[21:12.760 --> 21:16.980]  And Emily and I were in the garage getting them set up and her dad came in
[21:16.980 --> 21:19.020]  and he goes, Hey, it'd be really cool if you guys wore helmets.
[21:19.080 --> 21:20.200]  And we're like, yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
[21:20.240 --> 21:21.900]  And he gave us some helmets because they already have them.
[21:22.740 --> 21:26.380]  And we have some kind of cool looking helmets that look kind of like motorcycle
[21:26.380 --> 21:27.000]  helmets at home.
[21:27.240 --> 21:31.620]  These are those helmets that look that you just put it on and it's like you're
[21:31.620 --> 21:34.540]  asking to be bullied, you know, they're just, there's nothing cool about them.
[21:35.180 --> 21:38.000]  And I'm like, yeah, whatever, you know, it's safety first. Right.
[21:38.040 --> 21:42.400]  And we're driving strange roads and whatever makes people happy.
[21:42.460 --> 21:45.180]  And so Emily put her helmet on and she's pretty safety conscious.
[21:45.180 --> 21:47.300]  She's been making me wear a helmet at home when I ride my bike.
[21:48.220 --> 21:51.220]  And and so we put our helmets on and she's like, do I look stupid?
[21:51.300 --> 21:53.240]  And I was like, no, yeah, but everybody,
[21:53.380 --> 21:55.580]  everybody on a bike looks stupid with a helmet on. It's cool.
[21:56.160 --> 21:57.480]  You're just among the group. Right.
[21:57.780 --> 22:02.480]  And so we're riding along and just happy as can be riding through sunny
[22:03.580 --> 22:04.380]  Michigan streets.
[22:04.680 --> 22:08.900]  And up on the left is a guy walking a bike, an old dude,
[22:09.060 --> 22:13.740]  like think like old Ben and Jerry dude, scrawny, long beard,
[22:14.520 --> 22:17.820]  long, scraggly gray hair, got super skinny,
[22:18.020 --> 22:21.760]  got a pushing a bike in one like a 10 speed in one hand and walking a dog in the
[22:21.760 --> 22:23.920]  other. Right. Real crunchy looking dude.
[22:24.400 --> 22:29.080]  And we drive by him and he looks at us and he smiles and he
[22:30.260 --> 22:32.880]  goes, hey, pedal power.
[22:34.560 --> 22:37.220]  And I go, hell yeah. And I wave back at him.
[22:37.300 --> 22:39.260]  And Emily, we get a few feet down the road and he goes,
[22:39.600 --> 22:42.620]  did that man just make fun of us? Did he make fun of me?
[22:42.620 --> 22:46.700]  And I go, what do you mean? And she goes, did he call us Ninja Turtles?
[22:47.260 --> 22:49.720]  And I go, I'm sorry, what? And she goes, do we look,
[22:49.840 --> 22:53.160]  is it because we have the helmets on? Did he just call us Ninja Turtles?
[22:53.360 --> 22:55.400]  And I'm like, what did you think he said?
[22:55.740 --> 22:59.660]  She thought when we rode by the guy yelled, hey, turtle power!
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.660]  Making fun of us for looking like Ninja Turtles because we had helmets on in
[23:06.660 --> 23:11.600]  some way. And I was like, no, but she looked like, I'm sure she wasn't,
[23:11.600 --> 23:13.320]  but she looked like maybe she was about to cry.
[23:13.460 --> 23:16.500]  Like she was really offended that somebody yelled, called her a Ninja Turtle.
[23:16.640 --> 23:19.020]  And I was like, no, no, no. She got bullied.
[23:19.120 --> 23:23.040]  It was complimenting us on riding bikes. And she was like, oh, I'm not sure.
[23:23.140 --> 23:26.680]  And I was like, I promise you he yelled pedal power, not turtle power.
[23:26.940 --> 23:30.480]  Maybe if turtles wore the shells on their heads, that'd be more accurate.
[23:30.780 --> 23:32.480]  That was so fucking funny, dude.
[23:33.040 --> 23:36.800]  I don't know how she got turtle power out of that and how that turned into her,
[23:36.800 --> 23:41.660]  I just preying on her natural insecurities from wearing a bike helmet and looking
[23:41.660 --> 23:43.660]  silly. But man, it was, I fucking laughed.
[23:43.740 --> 23:45.600]  I turtle powered for the next two weeks.
[23:46.600 --> 23:49.680]  Hell yeah. I mean, they were skateboarders, right?
[23:50.040 --> 23:52.700]  The turtles, are they skateboarding? I feel like, yeah,
[23:52.700 --> 23:54.280]  they skateboarded sometimes. Yeah.
[23:54.800 --> 23:57.860]  That's my one thing interesting that happened on my trip to Michigan,
[23:57.860 --> 24:01.820]  other than something I texted. It was a peaceful time.
[24:01.860 --> 24:06.100]  I watched a lot of sports with Dwight and Kent, went to a Tigers game, you know,
[24:06.100 --> 24:09.280]  had to eat a million good things. One thing I did eat though,
[24:09.340 --> 24:12.460]  and I was texting you guys about it or slacking you guys about it that I figured
[24:12.460 --> 24:15.660]  we should address. We're coming up on what, actually, Nick,
[24:15.740 --> 24:18.200]  what date is this episode release? 30th.
[24:18.200 --> 24:22.320]  This comes out on... 30th. 30th. 30th. 30th. Yep. This is awesome.
[24:22.460 --> 24:25.420]  So this comes out July 30th? Yeah. That's right. Perfect.
[24:25.700 --> 24:31.740]  Because July 31st is the final day of our year of hot dogs.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.900]  Oh, it is? Yeah. We started on August 1st. So you go August 1st,
[24:35.900 --> 24:37.880]  August 1st. So July 31st,
[24:37.900 --> 24:41.980]  tomorrow will be the last full day for people to eat hot dogs to hit their
[24:41.980 --> 24:45.780]  national average, if that's a thing that they're trying to do. Or just to see,
[24:45.860 --> 24:47.300]  because it's not, you know, it's not a contest.
[24:47.920 --> 24:49.920]  National average being 70-ish, I think.
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.100]  And just to be clear,
[24:51.160 --> 24:55.480]  the day that we're recording this is the 14th of July.
[24:55.640 --> 24:59.820]  So we're a little ahead, a couple of weeks ahead of our cutoff date.
[25:00.400 --> 25:03.800]  The last day being the 31st, the last day of hot dogs,
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.540]  but the first day of Gerplers being August the 1st at 1pm.
[25:09.460 --> 25:10.600]  Yeah, that's a Friday.
[25:11.160 --> 25:16.180]  And so be there on twitch.tv slash the regulation pod and you can see that.
[25:16.260 --> 25:20.220]  And then the regulation store dot com or regulation store dot store is where you
[25:20.220 --> 25:23.080]  can get the Gerpler. But guys, if you were talking about, I mean,
[25:23.080 --> 25:26.380]  do you foresee yourself eating more dogs before the end of this?
[25:26.820 --> 25:30.360]  Well, that's kind of where I want to go with this. And by the way,
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.860]  definitely go celebrate a year of hot dogs by buying a Cosmic Gerpler.
[25:33.960 --> 25:36.620]  And while you're there, we have idiot flags and other stuff in the stock.
[25:36.700 --> 25:40.280]  You go to the store right now. There's stuff in the store for you to buy.
[25:40.500 --> 25:43.180]  I feel like I don't do a good job of mentioning that in the podcast and I should.
[25:43.260 --> 25:45.440]  You can buy idiot flags. There's two different t-shirts.
[25:45.680 --> 25:47.740]  I think there might be four t-shirts you can get or three.
[25:47.800 --> 25:50.860]  There's all kinds of stuff. We got stuff. We got stuff anyway.
[25:52.560 --> 25:56.320]  One of the first things I did when I got to Michigan was hit up a Coney, right?
[25:56.320 --> 26:01.900]  Because Michigan is a hot dog state and I look at it as sort of like a hot dog
[26:01.900 --> 26:04.800]  Shangri-La. I always know I'm going to pack them in when I get up there.
[26:05.740 --> 26:09.560]  Went to a Coney place on day two. I think I was there.
[26:10.080 --> 26:13.660]  Ordered some dogs, sat down, got my hot dog,
[26:13.820 --> 26:18.300]  looked like a fucking just a lovely bog standard Coney.
[26:19.720 --> 26:22.820]  And I realized something
[26:23.860 --> 26:27.780]  that quite shocked me. I didn't want to eat it.
[26:27.900 --> 26:33.580]  It's the first time I think someone has put a hot dog in front of me and I
[26:33.580 --> 26:35.460]  didn't want it. And that was, you know,
[26:35.520 --> 26:40.060]  we've come a long way since the original prompt that I issued you guys over a
[26:40.060 --> 26:41.360]  year ago now, which was just,
[26:41.560 --> 26:44.260]  what's one food you don't say no to when it's offered to you, right?
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.420]  For me it was hot dogs. I think I have found my limit.
[26:47.960 --> 26:51.880]  I ate that hot dog because I needed to and because I paid for it.
[26:51.880 --> 26:55.800]  And I, it was fine. It was what a hot dog should taste like.
[26:56.040 --> 27:01.200]  But I think I just hit a limit where hot dogs are no longer appetizing to me
[27:01.840 --> 27:05.240]  currently. Wasn't sure. Like I was like, maybe I have an off day, right?
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.540]  Maybe things aren't going, maybe it's just a weird day. I've been traveling.
[27:08.860 --> 27:10.120]  I got travel tummy. Who knows?
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.660]  You just got called a ninja turtle. Like things were rough.
[27:12.660 --> 27:17.560]  I just got bullied by an old hippie on a bike. Yeah. Like I,
[27:17.720 --> 27:20.840]  so I waited a couple of days, avoided hot dogs,
[27:21.460 --> 27:26.820]  focused on pizza. Then I went to a Tigers game, got myself a game dog.
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.720]  You can't go wrong with a game dog, right? It was a struggle to eat it.
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.980]  You're dogged out. You got dogged out. Guys, I'm officially dogged out.
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.860]  I don't know if anything's going to change between the recording of this July
[27:40.860 --> 27:45.400]  14th and July 31st, but I, I, oh, and that's a delicious looking dog.
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.180]  I very well made, those are my two dogs. Yeah. And you can't see it,
[27:49.180 --> 27:51.320]  but there's onions and peppers under that dog. They're just,
[27:51.460 --> 27:53.260]  it's laid on top of them. Uh,
[27:53.340 --> 27:56.740]  I very well may be done with hot dogs,
[27:56.860 --> 28:01.200]  not forever like a corn dog, but I, after a year of hot dogs,
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.380]  I may, I'm considering taking a year off of hot dogs. Really?
[28:05.980 --> 28:10.300]  I think this is a more interesting experiment to see how many dogs it takes you
[28:10.300 --> 28:14.560]  to get dogged out. Cause how many corn dogs dogged you out? A lifetime of them.
[28:14.640 --> 28:17.700]  I don't know. But in that one year, it can't have been more than like 20,
[28:17.700 --> 28:21.060]  surely. Was it? Oh no, surely it wasn't more than 20. Yeah.
[28:21.100 --> 28:25.040]  So I don't know what I'm at like 58 or 59, maybe. I don't know.
[28:25.100 --> 28:27.820]  Somewhere around the high fifties. I don't know what my current count is,
[28:27.980 --> 28:29.060]  but it, uh,
[28:29.280 --> 28:34.360]  I don't think an experiment has ever been so skewed by the act of measuring it
[28:34.360 --> 28:36.040]  in all of human history.
[28:38.540 --> 28:43.180]  No point where any average... I definitely ate 40 more hot dogs than I would have.
[28:43.180 --> 28:44.180]  Yeah, you did.
[28:46.380 --> 28:47.640]  I think everyone did.
[28:47.960 --> 28:52.480]  I think I ruined hot dogs for myself in the near future in the service of this
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.020]  podcast. I think the hot dog boat is going to pass you by again.
[28:56.580 --> 28:59.240]  I think it'll come back. I agree. I agree. It'll come back, but man.
[28:59.960 --> 29:03.200]  Yeah. So we found out your dogged out count and it's going to be interesting to
[29:03.200 --> 29:06.500]  see how long it takes for you to bounce back. Yeah.
[29:06.760 --> 29:07.360]  I want to make,
[29:07.480 --> 29:10.700]  I want to make a prediction that he eats one more before the count's done for
[29:10.700 --> 29:12.940]  the year. I got to eat one more. I guarantee you,
[29:12.960 --> 29:15.920]  because at some point between now and July 31st,
[29:16.120 --> 29:18.280]  Eric and I will go to Nanya together.
[29:18.620 --> 29:22.720]  All I was thinking about was there's no way he's not eating a dog from Nanya.
[29:23.040 --> 29:26.280]  Like there's just no way he's not. I'll eat the Nanya dog, which is by the way,
[29:26.300 --> 29:30.100]  I saw him post about it. It's like the, it's kind of like naturally a smash dog.
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.480]  He was saying. Oh, that's great. It's all cut up and stuff. It's really good.
[29:33.760 --> 29:35.920]  It's great. I feel like if I go to Nanya, I might,
[29:36.040 --> 29:38.160]  I might be able to get double digits before the end of the year.
[29:38.680 --> 29:40.620]  I agree. They look delicious.
[29:41.120 --> 29:44.860]  Let's go Monday when you're back in town. All right. Back Tuesday.
[29:45.480 --> 29:46.820]  Tuesday, when you're back in town.
[29:47.460 --> 29:48.740]  I can go Monday at night.
[29:49.560 --> 29:52.560]  I figured that Geoff and I don't mean to be critical of the place.
[29:52.660 --> 29:55.880]  I feel like that first dog you posted very unappetizing.
[29:56.400 --> 29:58.160]  I think maybe that would be it visually.
[29:58.340 --> 30:02.480]  I think it doesn't look good, but that second dog looks beautiful.
[30:02.740 --> 30:03.860]  It's a perfect looking dog.
[30:04.180 --> 30:05.740]  That first one does look dog shit.
[30:05.740 --> 30:08.360]  Yeah, it looks visually very ugly.
[30:08.540 --> 30:09.940]  It's a bog standard, Coney.
[30:10.140 --> 30:12.700]  It's just chili and onions and then a hot dog in there.
[30:12.780 --> 30:13.800]  It's fucking they're delicious.
[30:13.960 --> 30:17.760]  This cheese, I think, but not criticizing the taste anyway,
[30:17.840 --> 30:19.200]  just visually unappetizing.
[30:19.520 --> 30:22.400]  It also might be the fault of the photographer, not the hot dog.
[30:22.580 --> 30:24.680]  You know, maybe we got to throw that into it, too.
[30:25.100 --> 30:30.420]  But yeah, so if anybody like not only did I not, I think, hit the national average.
[30:30.620 --> 30:34.880]  I think I ruined hot dogs trying to do it, at least at least for a while.
[30:35.760 --> 30:37.460]  Really kind of bummed about it.
[30:37.620 --> 30:38.940]  I predict.
[30:40.040 --> 30:42.460]  That it will be back by June of next year.
[30:43.460 --> 30:46.000]  So it'll only take me 11 months to recover, not 12.
[30:46.440 --> 30:47.520]  I think so.
[30:47.580 --> 30:49.260]  I think once we maybe.
[30:50.260 --> 30:51.300]  No, I think June.
[30:51.620 --> 30:55.400]  I think once it starts feeling summery, you'll get that itch again.
[30:55.900 --> 30:57.320]  Maybe. I hope so.
[30:57.400 --> 30:59.400]  But as we said, I don't think you're gone.
[30:59.460 --> 31:04.200]  I think you're like you're like a hot dog lighthouse in the night.
[31:04.200 --> 31:07.500]  And the boats just aren't coming through for a little bit.
[31:07.820 --> 31:08.840]  But you're still looking.
[31:09.580 --> 31:12.100]  You're still shining that light out there, trying to find it.
[31:12.540 --> 31:15.460]  I don't I don't want to be off the dog.
[31:15.740 --> 31:16.440]  You know, it's not.
[31:16.920 --> 31:18.520]  It's not a choice that I'm making.
[31:18.600 --> 31:20.680]  It's a choice that my stomach is making for me.
[31:21.520 --> 31:23.180]  Unfortunately, it is.
[31:23.240 --> 31:24.500]  We'll see. We'll see. We'll see.
[31:24.540 --> 31:26.300]  We will find out. We'll find out.
[31:27.140 --> 31:30.600]  I had a very exciting rabbit hole.
[31:30.720 --> 31:32.180]  I went down big Lord drop.
[31:32.700 --> 31:36.160]  I watched the movie The Edge recently,
[31:36.800 --> 31:40.660]  which is a film starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.
[31:40.800 --> 31:42.060]  And there's a bear in it.
[31:42.360 --> 31:45.580]  And that's all I knew about it is it's a movie about Anthony Hopkins
[31:45.580 --> 31:47.020]  and Alec Baldwin fighting a bear.
[31:47.580 --> 31:49.240]  And it was fun.
[31:49.360 --> 31:52.480]  It's a movie that takes itself too seriously at times,
[31:52.480 --> 31:56.220]  and it's completely cartoonish and ridiculous during it.
[31:56.860 --> 31:59.760]  But and I'm glad I didn't see this in theaters
[31:59.760 --> 32:02.080]  because it would have been an intentional moment.
[32:02.500 --> 32:06.120]  It is supposed to be a very intense movie where they're getting chased
[32:06.120 --> 32:09.440]  by a man hunting bear that they have to deal with.
[32:09.820 --> 32:12.900]  And then you get to the end credits and the end credits.
[32:12.960 --> 32:17.520]  The first thing that appears is it transitions from
[32:17.520 --> 32:22.800]  from how did you survive this vicious thing that killed other men to shout out
[32:22.800 --> 32:25.780]  to our homie Bart the bear for making this movie with us.
[32:25.800 --> 32:27.000]  We like Bart the bear.
[32:27.000 --> 32:28.640]  That's thanks.
[32:28.780 --> 32:33.660]  Big ups for your work in this film, which immediately led me to Google
[32:33.660 --> 32:34.440]  Bart the bear.
[32:34.520 --> 32:38.800]  I needed to see what other films he had been in, and it did not disappoint.
[32:39.120 --> 32:43.140]  His IMDb, I will say, unfortunately for Bart, the bear was typecasted
[32:43.140 --> 32:44.960]  a lot as the bear.
[32:46.080 --> 32:50.080]  He has so many roles that are just bear or the bear.
[32:50.200 --> 32:51.680]  He got to be Walking Thunder.
[32:52.160 --> 32:53.060]  That was exciting.
[32:53.060 --> 32:57.520]  But my personal favorite role of his was the bear attacking children
[32:57.520 --> 32:59.400]  and fighting Arie Schwieg.
[33:00.740 --> 33:03.580]  I just love that they shouted out the name of the bear.
[33:03.700 --> 33:06.600]  So I can Google the bear, which was not a thing when this movie came out
[33:06.600 --> 33:09.000]  and immediately go deep on the bear lore.
[33:09.560 --> 33:13.480]  Bart the bear was in a bunch of movies, had a brother,
[33:14.080 --> 33:18.580]  I believe that I'm blanking their name, a tank or brick or something.
[33:18.580 --> 33:22.500]  That means in that TV series, there surely were other bears
[33:22.500 --> 33:24.740]  not attacking children, like if they had to specify.
[33:25.340 --> 33:27.540]  That's a great I didn't even consider that implication.
[33:27.760 --> 33:29.860]  But I guess there's a whole line of bears.
[33:29.980 --> 33:32.780]  There was a Bart 2, which is unrelated to Bart,
[33:32.860 --> 33:35.640]  but the same people trained it and just named it Bart 2.
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.380]  But then Bart 2 had a sister, I think, that was in more movies.
[33:39.980 --> 33:43.140]  Brad Pitt made a documentary, I think, about Bart the bear
[33:43.140 --> 33:44.800]  for the National Geographic channel.
[33:45.500 --> 33:47.020]  I don't know why he was dealing with bear,
[33:47.020 --> 33:51.040]  but the more I learned about Bart the bear, what a rabbit hole I went on.
[33:51.240 --> 33:55.240]  And just what a strange the idea of like animal IMDb pages
[33:55.240 --> 33:59.160]  thinking about them making like career choices as an actor really amused me.
[33:59.920 --> 34:04.000]  Like Bart's mulling over is the next batch of scripts
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.880]  to see which one makes the most sense for him.
[34:06.200 --> 34:08.840]  Absolutely. Like you really wants to be in 12 Monkeys,
[34:08.920 --> 34:10.880]  but does he want to be the bear again?
[34:11.520 --> 34:12.400]  It's tough.
[34:13.080 --> 34:14.580]  What a tough choice to make.
[34:14.780 --> 34:16.840]  Has anybody else seen that movie, The Edge?
[34:17.740 --> 34:21.360]  No, no, I saw it in the theater and correct me if I'm wrong, Andrew,
[34:21.460 --> 34:25.040]  but the only thing I remember about that film is there's a scene
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.120]  where Alec Baldwin tells Anthony Hopkins, that's the spirit that beat the Japanese,
[34:29.520 --> 34:31.740]  which I always thought was such a wild thing to say.
[34:32.340 --> 34:33.840]  What was he talking about?
[34:34.880 --> 34:37.220]  The Japanese? Referring to World War Two, I believe.
[34:37.560 --> 34:40.300]  But yeah, he's trying to like toughen up Anthony Hopkins.
[34:41.600 --> 34:42.940]  And he's also trying to kill
[34:42.940 --> 34:44.180]  Anthony Hopkins the whole time, too, right?
[34:44.220 --> 34:45.980]  Because he's trying to steal his wife or something.
[34:46.380 --> 34:47.960]  The look he's giving in the movie poster,
[34:48.140 --> 34:50.240]  I've seen him give that look to a lot of paparazzi.
[34:52.240 --> 34:57.200]  It is a strange movie where Anthony Hopkins plays the billionaire
[34:57.200 --> 35:03.480]  to a model wife, and Alec Baldwin is the photographer of the wife,
[35:03.580 --> 35:05.300]  I guess, like they regularly shoot together.
[35:05.680 --> 35:10.100]  And there is sort of a weird implication of their relationship dynamics.
[35:10.120 --> 35:12.660]  And then they end up crashing this scenario.
[35:12.660 --> 35:15.620]  And it's not really brought up until, spoilers,
[35:15.840 --> 35:17.520]  Anthony Hopkins kills the bear.
[35:17.800 --> 35:22.460]  And then what's very funny is they kill the bear.
[35:22.600 --> 35:25.980]  And then like the next transitional scene,
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.440]  they've made entire outfits out of the bear's remains.
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.320]  Like it took them five minutes to skin this bear
[35:32.320 --> 35:35.620]  and then sew together these very elaborate outfits.
[35:36.300 --> 35:39.080]  Then they go to a little, they find a little hut.
[35:39.220 --> 35:41.360]  And then Alec Baldwin's like, yeah, I'm going to murder you
[35:41.360 --> 35:44.440]  because I want to steal your money and be with your wife.
[35:45.300 --> 35:46.120]  He just tells him.
[35:46.520 --> 35:48.760]  Yeah, well, it's a really kind of.
[35:49.800 --> 35:53.660]  It's not very exciting of a reveal where Anthony Hopkins is looking for a thing
[35:53.660 --> 35:57.640]  to light, and he opens up a gift that his wife gave him
[35:57.640 --> 35:59.320]  because it was his birthday the day before.
[35:59.540 --> 36:03.820]  And he realized that on the receipt, it was also Alec Baldwin's watch
[36:04.520 --> 36:08.160]  that that he got, like his wife bought like three different gifts
[36:08.160 --> 36:10.080]  for three different people at the same time.
[36:10.080 --> 36:11.160]  And one of them was the watch.
[36:11.880 --> 36:16.060]  It takes a very strange turn, though, where he he traps Alec Baldwin
[36:16.060 --> 36:20.200]  into a fall pit where he gets impaled through the thigh
[36:20.200 --> 36:24.480]  by a massive log, and then he just saves him.
[36:25.000 --> 36:26.200]  Like he doesn't kill him.
[36:26.220 --> 36:29.500]  He then retrieves him from the thing and they go kayaking for a while.
[36:31.340 --> 36:33.000]  And then it becomes a buddy comedy.
[36:33.520 --> 36:34.700]  And then it becomes a buddy comedy.
[36:34.880 --> 36:37.660]  And then Alec Baldwin's like, oh, it's crazy.
[36:38.260 --> 36:38.740]  Rapids.
[36:38.800 --> 36:40.860]  And then the bears wearing a watch as well.
[36:41.420 --> 36:43.880]  Oh, the bear has a son and the son shows up.
[36:43.980 --> 36:45.840]  The sun bears not happy.
[36:45.920 --> 36:48.100]  It's Jaws. It's Jaws with bears.
[36:49.100 --> 36:53.620]  It had some very odd casting, too, where it's the you know, his name,
[36:53.660 --> 36:56.560]  the guy from Beverly Hills Cop that like is the shop owner.
[36:56.740 --> 36:59.400]  Now the other guy, that's the shop owner
[37:00.220 --> 37:04.020]  that like Eddie Murphy interacts with, and he comes back in the third movie.
[37:04.340 --> 37:06.660]  I think shop owner. What shop?
[37:07.160 --> 37:10.740]  It's like he goes to like an all the really sarcastic guy.
[37:11.820 --> 37:12.940]  Yeah. The art gallery.
[37:13.060 --> 37:16.640]  Dude, there's like the light European guy that has like a European accent
[37:16.640 --> 37:18.400]  in the movie. Yeah, I don't.
[37:18.500 --> 37:20.760]  I'm surprised you don't just know who this person is, Geoff.
[37:21.920 --> 37:24.160]  Are you talking about Bronson Pinchot?
[37:24.640 --> 37:26.240]  Yeah, maybe he plays Serge.
[37:26.860 --> 37:29.980]  Yes, him. He's in the edge, but he has no dialogue.
[37:32.740 --> 37:34.700]  OK, I just thought that was.
[37:37.760 --> 37:39.080]  I thought that was strange.
[37:39.240 --> 37:41.480]  I was expecting him to like be involved.
[37:43.520 --> 37:46.460]  My main takeaway, though, from the edge was that Bart the bear exists.
[37:46.600 --> 37:48.360]  It was a lot of fun to go down that rabbit hole.
[37:48.680 --> 37:49.160]  Bart the bear.
[37:50.940 --> 37:54.540]  I think the that's the first time Eric's picture is the first time
[37:54.540 --> 37:55.480]  I've seen a bear cock.
[37:58.740 --> 38:00.760]  Go look at this bear's unit.
[38:01.180 --> 38:05.300]  Let's see. It's weird that such a large imposing animal
[38:05.300 --> 38:08.260]  is never referred to as like a large.
[38:08.440 --> 38:10.700]  Like people go to horse cock a lot.
[38:11.280 --> 38:14.160]  Nobody ever says he's hung like a bear, like a grizzly.
[38:14.400 --> 38:16.760]  Yeah. So maybe they're not that impressive.
[38:17.840 --> 38:19.840]  I I don't want to.
[38:19.980 --> 38:21.260]  I don't want to overdo this bit.
[38:21.520 --> 38:23.160]  I think we'll have some separation from it.
[38:23.940 --> 38:25.660]  But I have a new things I learned.
[38:26.260 --> 38:27.340]  OK, last word.
[38:27.500 --> 38:29.280]  Oh, I can't wait, man. This is awesome.
[38:29.600 --> 38:33.460]  Oh, yeah, it's kind of connected to the edge a little bit.
[38:33.460 --> 38:37.160]  You want to read those off and we can pick one and we can sort of dissect it.
[38:37.240 --> 38:41.100]  So my three prompts are hit man, fool, doom is here and bear disease.
[38:41.760 --> 38:44.460]  Can I ask how many of these things that you've learned have you learned?
[38:45.160 --> 38:46.240]  I don't know what that means.
[38:47.140 --> 38:48.640]  Well, last last time you hadn't learned.
[38:48.860 --> 38:51.000]  Oh, because I didn't know, because last time I asked a question, I get it.
[38:51.080 --> 38:52.880]  Ah, funny bit. Ha ha ha.
[38:53.540 --> 38:55.020]  What's the bit? You didn't.
[38:55.140 --> 38:56.700]  It was you. You hadn't learned.
[38:57.080 --> 38:58.400]  Yeah, but this is stuff I learned.
[38:58.980 --> 38:59.380]  Oh, OK.
[38:59.800 --> 39:01.540]  But these are all things I've learned definitively.
[39:01.840 --> 39:03.000]  But that's what you said last time, too.
[39:03.560 --> 39:04.320]  Yeah, but I was.
[39:06.900 --> 39:08.980]  Well, OK, what is hit man, fool, Andrew?
[39:09.420 --> 39:10.060]  Hit man, fool.
[39:11.060 --> 39:14.800]  Uh, I realized that there is a map in Hitman,
[39:15.060 --> 39:19.160]  so I've been replaying Hitman three because it has all of the Hitman games
[39:19.160 --> 39:22.160]  in it has hit me and one hit me to him in three, at least all the games
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.240]  in the most recent trilogy.
[39:23.720 --> 39:28.660]  And I've been going through and getting that you call it level mastery.
[39:29.100 --> 39:30.120]  So I've gone through.
[39:30.180 --> 39:32.260]  I've played some of these games multiple times.
[39:32.260 --> 39:35.320]  I played Hitman two through level mastery at least twice.
[39:36.580 --> 39:37.280]  Hitman three.
[39:37.380 --> 39:40.600]  I've done it doing it on Hitman one in Hitman three.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  And one of the challenges you get.
[39:43.080 --> 39:45.640]  So to get mastery on a level, you have to do a bunch of challenges.
[39:45.980 --> 39:51.060]  And one of them is to discover all of the locations within the map.
[39:51.120 --> 39:52.900]  So there are different rooms and sectors.
[39:53.560 --> 39:56.440]  I didn't know that you could hit select
[39:56.440 --> 40:00.040]  and go into a map screen and just see a map.
[40:00.040 --> 40:04.300]  And I've spent probably over 100 hours playing these Hitman games.
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.580]  This trilogy, this this is coming from a guy who recently complained
[40:07.580 --> 40:10.540]  about Mind's Eye, where it has a mini map, but no map.
[40:11.120 --> 40:12.980]  Yeah, but that's on Mind's Eye.
[40:13.160 --> 40:17.280]  You never thought, oh, this mini map in Hitman doesn't have a full map.
[40:17.580 --> 40:21.680]  I guess I've never felt the need to use it for how I play.
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.620]  Like, I'm just kind of walking around and holding right bumper to see like I
[40:26.620 --> 40:27.440]  definitely never.
[40:28.040 --> 40:29.420]  Yeah, you don't need the map. You're good.
[40:29.420 --> 40:31.500]  I don't I don't need it. I'm good.
[40:31.760 --> 40:35.480]  But what I didn't realize is on the map,
[40:35.500 --> 40:39.180]  it tells you what areas you haven't visited before.
[40:39.700 --> 40:45.560]  So up until this point, I would spend sometimes like two hours
[40:46.140 --> 40:51.640]  just scavenging every corner of a map, being like, I found 30 of 31 locations.
[40:51.760 --> 40:56.580]  Where the fuck is this one room that I can't find, all the while
[40:56.580 --> 41:00.160]  not knowing that I could have just hit select and then checked
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.740]  every area of the map immediately and figured out where I was missing.
[41:04.780 --> 41:08.200]  It notifies there's a marker as to where you haven't been.
[41:09.400 --> 41:10.640]  Huge waste of time.
[41:10.860 --> 41:13.300]  Such a big part of that game is the map.
[41:13.740 --> 41:15.520]  Gav, can I ask a question between you and I?
[41:15.980 --> 41:19.740]  Can I be let off the hook now for not knowing about how to auto aim
[41:19.740 --> 41:21.260]  and crack down until after I beat it?
[41:21.360 --> 41:22.360]  Because this seems way worse.
[41:22.600 --> 41:24.480]  Yeah, I think. Yeah, it's definitely.
[41:24.480 --> 41:27.740]  I think it's different because this is like, mechanically,
[41:27.800 --> 41:30.020]  I'm not missing something within the game.
[41:30.280 --> 41:31.980]  It's just like the map.
[41:32.320 --> 41:32.880]  What are you talking?
[41:33.160 --> 41:35.720]  Mechanically, you're missing the whole mechanic of the map.
[41:36.080 --> 41:40.280]  I am not missing a mechanic in playing the game and and like
[41:40.280 --> 41:43.520]  how I interact with the world as the character.
[41:44.580 --> 41:45.660]  Does that make sense?
[41:45.660 --> 41:47.620]  That's the only service a map
[41:48.920 --> 41:52.760]  provides in a video game is to help you interact with the game as the character.
[41:52.980 --> 41:53.840]  Oh, it's so good.
[41:53.840 --> 41:56.180]  It's like watching a coyote with his foot caught in a trap,
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.060]  just going like, I got to get out of this thing.
[41:58.060 --> 41:58.420]  No, no, no.
[41:58.620 --> 42:00.940]  I think there's a difference because what Geoff was doing.
[42:01.380 --> 42:04.780]  Geoff shoots somebody in crackdown all the time.
[42:04.880 --> 42:06.120]  You're that's all you're doing.
[42:06.540 --> 42:09.000]  You're not always looking at a map and hit me.
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.920]  You sometimes would engage with it to like find your place or whatever.
[42:13.120 --> 42:15.160]  You're not always shooting in crackdown.
[42:15.260 --> 42:16.840]  Sometimes you're punching. What else are you doing?
[42:17.260 --> 42:18.400]  You can punch people.
[42:18.700 --> 42:20.840]  You can kick people. You can drive.
[42:21.500 --> 42:23.020]  You can fall asleep. Climb.
[42:23.020 --> 42:24.860]  You can race and fall asleep.
[42:25.060 --> 42:28.280]  If you're going to do a pie chart of things you're doing in crackdown,
[42:28.480 --> 42:30.440]  70% of it is firing weapons.
[42:30.700 --> 42:34.480]  I bet if you were to do a pie chart and people that play the game properly
[42:34.480 --> 42:38.280]  and hit man, look at the full map would come up a lot more than you realize.
[42:38.520 --> 42:40.760]  I think less than 30%.
[42:40.760 --> 42:44.680]  The original games, you would have a live feed of where everyone was on the map, too.
[42:44.880 --> 42:47.400]  It's like how you knew everyone was going to be on the other side of the door.
[42:47.860 --> 42:50.400]  I've looked at the map in other Hitman games.
[42:50.520 --> 42:52.660]  I just never engage with it in this trilogy.
[42:53.560 --> 42:57.380]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:57.380 --> 42:58.980]  Hang on. That makes it even worse.
[42:59.100 --> 43:01.740]  What? Hang on. Wait, what? Hang on.
[43:01.860 --> 43:05.520]  Wait, you use the map in other Hitman games?
[43:05.920 --> 43:09.960]  Because it would, as Gavin said, it would actually show where the enemies are
[43:09.960 --> 43:11.460]  and like where the target is.
[43:11.580 --> 43:15.220]  But in this one, you just use your intuition and you see.
[43:17.040 --> 43:18.420]  You just see where they are.
[43:19.040 --> 43:19.780]  You don't need the map.
[43:19.940 --> 43:22.500]  So crazy. They took the map out of this game.
[43:22.500 --> 43:23.900]  That's so strange.
[43:24.220 --> 43:24.960]  There's some stuff.
[43:25.160 --> 43:28.140]  Well, there were some pretty big changes in how Hitman worked,
[43:28.260 --> 43:31.080]  especially from like Absolution to the original trilogy.
[43:31.500 --> 43:32.920]  There's a big shift, Absolution.
[43:33.120 --> 43:34.760]  I would say it's worse because of this.
[43:34.820 --> 43:37.660]  You played a version of Hitman before that had a full map.
[43:37.860 --> 43:40.060]  So you had to load this version of Hitman up and go like,
[43:40.120 --> 43:42.640]  Oh, I guess the map's gone. I won't bother looking for it.
[43:42.780 --> 43:43.920]  I was playing Crackdown one.
[43:44.080 --> 43:46.240]  I didn't know that there was a lock on mechanic in the game
[43:46.240 --> 43:48.680]  because I had no previous knowledge with with Crackdown.
[43:48.760 --> 43:50.600]  I just missed that part of the tutorial.
[43:50.600 --> 43:57.140]  So with you, there's a legacy of map that you had experienced in Hitman.
[43:57.340 --> 44:00.360]  So if you were going for Silent Assassin and you got hit by a camera,
[44:00.720 --> 44:03.520]  you wouldn't just look on the map where the security was
[44:03.520 --> 44:04.600]  to go and turn off the cameras.
[44:04.680 --> 44:06.920]  You would just walk around until you found the office.
[44:07.740 --> 44:10.840]  I mean, I would never like Silent Assassin is a thing I would do
[44:10.840 --> 44:11.880]  after multiple runs.
[44:11.920 --> 44:14.200]  And by that point, I just know where the feeds were.
[44:15.740 --> 44:17.760]  Like you never go in thinking like,
[44:17.840 --> 44:19.880]  I'm going to get Silent Assassin on my first try.
[44:19.880 --> 44:22.360]  It's like the first time I play Hitman level,
[44:22.540 --> 44:26.720]  I am just walking around the map, scanning things and like
[44:26.720 --> 44:29.960]  registering personally like, OK, this is here.
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.620]  This does that. I can use this like it's just exploration.
[44:34.180 --> 44:36.740]  There's nothing more satisfying than a first attempt Silent Assassin.
[44:37.480 --> 44:38.760]  I see. I would never even.
[44:38.840 --> 44:40.840]  That's just not how I play these games ever.
[44:41.880 --> 44:42.860]  That's a later thing.
[44:43.560 --> 44:45.440]  That is if I want to get sweaty.
[44:45.880 --> 44:47.480]  But yeah, that is Hitman Fool.
[44:47.880 --> 44:50.800]  The other options are Doom is here and Bear Disease.
[44:51.720 --> 44:52.540]  Doom is here.
[44:53.280 --> 44:56.520]  I've been listening to the radio a lot recently.
[44:58.440 --> 45:01.420]  I just have gotten in the habit of I enjoy.
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.640]  I have an app that like I can listen to radio stations all across the world.
[45:08.120 --> 45:09.820]  And I just cycle through.
[45:10.160 --> 45:11.720]  I just find random things.
[45:11.940 --> 45:14.040]  My dad used to do that. Yeah.
[45:16.180 --> 45:17.720]  Son, it's been so long.
[45:19.520 --> 45:20.860]  I've just been scanning through.
[45:21.200 --> 45:25.160]  Geoff, you were in Vegas a while back throwing first pitch.
[45:25.640 --> 45:28.600]  But I believe I believe I was throwing heat, as they say.
[45:28.800 --> 45:30.420]  You were throwing heat. So I was in Vegas.
[45:30.780 --> 45:34.260]  And so that's just has been a like one of the areas in my app.
[45:34.300 --> 45:35.560]  And I was like, oh, go back to Vegas.
[45:36.060 --> 45:38.160]  And I was just cycling through.
[45:38.740 --> 45:42.480]  And I'll use this to sleep a lot of the time, too, where it has a sleep timer
[45:42.480 --> 45:44.520]  for like an hour, it'll turn off automatically.
[45:45.200 --> 45:49.280]  But I have an issue where if I listen to things I care about or enjoy,
[45:49.380 --> 45:51.240]  then I stay awake and I listen to them.
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.080]  So I needed something that I didn't give a shit about at all.
[45:55.700 --> 45:58.720]  And so I was like, oh, there's a religious radio station.
[45:58.840 --> 45:59.920]  Let me throw this on.
[45:59.960 --> 46:01.780]  I don't give a fuck about whatever is being said.
[46:01.820 --> 46:02.720]  It's just noise.
[46:03.240 --> 46:04.620]  Now you mentioned a map.
[46:04.660 --> 46:06.820]  Is this a full map or a mini map of these?
[46:07.420 --> 46:08.660]  It's a full map.
[46:08.660 --> 46:11.340]  But in this one, it doesn't show the target locations.
[46:11.340 --> 46:13.640]  Unlike previous iterations of the app.
[46:14.640 --> 46:17.220]  And you also can't lock on to cities.
[46:17.820 --> 46:19.720]  Despite what you may try to do.
[46:20.920 --> 46:21.880]  I put this on.
[46:21.900 --> 46:23.560]  So I was listening to this religious radio station.
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.280]  I didn't realize that there are people like obviously I get the God thing,
[46:28.360 --> 46:29.300]  believing in God or whatever.
[46:29.820 --> 46:32.180]  I didn't know that there are people that are just like there are demons
[46:32.180 --> 46:33.360]  on the streets.
[46:34.060 --> 46:35.060]  That's crazy to me.
[46:35.180 --> 46:37.200]  We live in doom in some people's eyes.
[46:37.860 --> 46:41.060]  There's just straight up demons walking around fucking nuts.
[46:41.340 --> 46:45.220]  What? Yeah, I think that's often why people will just kill their whole family
[46:45.220 --> 46:46.880]  is just to get rid of the demons.
[46:47.380 --> 46:50.620]  Well, it's just it was people just being like like,
[46:50.680 --> 46:54.720]  oh, the Satan's out there and demons and evil and whatnot.
[46:54.920 --> 46:56.080]  It's like, that's fucking crazy.
[46:56.620 --> 47:00.960]  I understood the idea of like being good or being a bad person,
[47:00.960 --> 47:04.700]  but to literally interpret the existence of demons walking around
[47:04.700 --> 47:07.400]  like in these people's eyes, we're living in doom.
[47:07.820 --> 47:08.500]  This is crazy.
[47:08.500 --> 47:11.160]  So is it like a they live situation where we can't tell?
[47:11.260 --> 47:12.400]  I think so. Yeah.
[47:12.600 --> 47:13.440]  From my understanding.
[47:14.400 --> 47:16.060]  Also, I'm not deep dive in the station.
[47:16.200 --> 47:19.380]  It was just I threw it on one evening and I was listening to a guy
[47:19.380 --> 47:22.700]  that sounded like piglet tell me that demons were real.
[47:22.940 --> 47:26.640]  And I was like, this is people have to be.
[47:26.900 --> 47:30.160]  And I hope this isn't a controversial statement, but maybe it is.
[47:30.640 --> 47:31.720]  So I know who you're talking about.
[47:31.780 --> 47:35.320]  Those people have to be the dumbest motherfuckers on Earth.
[47:35.720 --> 47:36.800]  It's just a wild belief.
[47:39.800 --> 47:42.600]  It just it opens up so many other.
[47:43.220 --> 47:44.800]  I guess. I don't know.
[47:44.960 --> 47:45.720]  It's just it's wild.
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.980]  I never processed the concept of literal demon acceptance or belief.
[47:51.600 --> 47:52.500]  So that was something I learned.
[47:52.580 --> 47:54.820]  I didn't know people actually thought that demons were walking around.
[47:55.340 --> 47:56.480]  My last one.
[47:57.060 --> 47:58.100]  Wait, how though?
[47:58.460 --> 48:00.220]  How did you not think people believe that?
[48:00.860 --> 48:04.900]  I guess I just am not a religious person and I sort of understand the.
[48:04.900 --> 48:08.340]  I guess it's sort of like Santa Claus to me where I get the concept
[48:08.340 --> 48:13.160]  of believing in the idea, but not necessarily the literal symbolism of it.
[48:13.520 --> 48:15.880]  Taking it literally and taking it
[48:16.400 --> 48:20.240]  like in a spiritual sense, I think, in my mind are very separate things.
[48:20.700 --> 48:23.460]  So where would demons sit between the Easter Bunny and God?
[48:25.600 --> 48:27.220]  Somewhere below, I believe.
[48:27.340 --> 48:30.060]  Right. Logistically, this is the hell thing.
[48:30.940 --> 48:31.460]  Logistically.
[48:32.240 --> 48:34.540]  Well, wait, isn't Easter Bunny God or something?
[48:34.540 --> 48:36.540]  That's tied to religion in some way.
[48:37.060 --> 48:39.160]  Yeah. And what do you mean by that?
[48:40.040 --> 48:44.620]  I mean that I've seen Greg the Bunny, and there is a thing where the
[48:44.620 --> 48:49.900]  the vampire was in a UFO and he was like Easter Day.
[48:49.940 --> 48:53.680]  This is the only podcast that talks about Greg the Bunny.
[48:53.820 --> 48:54.080]  It's okay.
[48:55.260 --> 48:58.720]  Is this our second Greg the Bunny reference this year?
[48:58.900 --> 49:02.100]  Yes, we have to stop talking about Greg the Bunny.
[49:02.480 --> 49:04.320]  And then it was like Conscious Pilot.
[49:04.320 --> 49:05.820]  He's wearing aviator goggles.
[49:06.220 --> 49:07.260]  And I don't know.
[49:08.100 --> 49:09.160]  Greg the Bunny was pretty good.
[49:10.000 --> 49:13.600]  There are some people who cannot exist in the world
[49:13.600 --> 49:17.500]  unless they find something to be terrified of and to hate.
[49:17.900 --> 49:21.860]  And they look for demons under every pillow and corner of their lives.
[49:22.060 --> 49:24.800]  It's sad. I just look for them in Doom.
[49:25.500 --> 49:26.500]  A good time with that.
[49:27.340 --> 49:29.720]  With some cool music and shoot some guns.
[49:30.560 --> 49:32.240]  Anyway, bear disease.
[49:33.460 --> 49:35.200]  Bart the Bear died of cancer.
[49:35.340 --> 49:37.460]  I didn't know that that was a thing bears could die of.
[49:38.240 --> 49:39.840]  I didn't realize bears could get cancer.
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.740]  I think it's just kind of everything, isn't it?
[49:42.260 --> 49:45.880]  There's that popular fact that sharks can't get cancer, right?
[49:46.120 --> 49:50.880]  Really? Which means in my head, I guess most stuff can get cancer.
[49:51.400 --> 49:52.640]  I didn't know that fact.
[49:52.960 --> 49:54.080]  I didn't know that about sharks.
[49:54.400 --> 49:58.080]  Isn't the thing that with sharks is that they could theoretically live forever
[49:58.080 --> 50:00.600]  if they just never caught any shark diseases?
[50:00.600 --> 50:04.080]  Cancer being one that they can't get, but there are other diseases they can get.
[50:04.680 --> 50:07.300]  I also heard if you turn one upside down, it goes to sleep.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.140]  Just like Albert.
[50:13.300 --> 50:14.040]  Yeah, I guess.
[50:14.200 --> 50:17.420]  How many like can a slug get cancer?
[50:18.260 --> 50:19.680]  I don't know. I assume so.
[50:20.480 --> 50:23.960]  Based on Bart getting cancer, probably doesn't live long enough.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.620]  You know, how long does a slug live?
[50:28.480 --> 50:30.660]  Let's all take guesses before I look it up.
[50:31.400 --> 50:34.180]  I'm going to say one month.
[50:34.680 --> 50:35.480]  OK, Gavin.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.780]  Two year slug. Two year slug.
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.680]  And the other two?
[50:39.180 --> 50:41.400]  18 months is going to be my guess for a slug.
[50:43.260 --> 50:44.600]  Nick's already on vacation.
[50:46.060 --> 50:47.480]  Are you playing GTA right now?
[50:47.780 --> 50:48.620]  Are you playing GTA?
[50:49.320 --> 50:50.560]  How long does a slug live?
[50:51.300 --> 50:53.860]  Slugs typically live for six to 18 months,
[50:53.920 --> 50:56.280]  but some species can live longer, up to three to four years.
[50:56.280 --> 50:59.180]  So I think Eric and Gavin are both pretty dead on.
[50:59.280 --> 51:00.020]  We're slug experts.
[51:00.660 --> 51:05.100]  Huh? I wonder if a slug that's been alive for four years
[51:05.100 --> 51:09.740]  is considered like a wizened old elder slug to the younger slugs.
[51:09.900 --> 51:13.460]  And they they just sit around like slug campfires and listen to stories.
[51:13.920 --> 51:15.460]  They go and visit it in the slug cave.
[51:19.420 --> 51:23.900]  I feel like animal lifespans are so often left out of animal facts.
[51:24.620 --> 51:26.980]  That's what? That's a really good point.
[51:27.240 --> 51:28.960]  Like, I don't know how long a bat lives.
[51:29.860 --> 51:31.720]  Which version? What?
[51:32.220 --> 51:33.280]  Which version of a bat?
[51:33.840 --> 51:36.900]  Oh, bats typically live between 10 and 20 years in the wild,
[51:37.000 --> 51:38.560]  but some species can live for 30 years.
[51:39.060 --> 51:42.040]  Shit. The longest lived bat on record
[51:42.040 --> 51:47.220]  was a male Brant's myotis bat that lived to be 41 years old.
[51:47.540 --> 51:50.440]  So there could be a bat alive right now from the 80s?
[51:51.820 --> 51:53.900]  Yeah, probably not a lot of them, but one or two.
[51:54.720 --> 51:57.360]  It'd be cool if you could if there was a website that told you
[51:57.360 --> 51:59.740]  all the animals that were older than you right now.
[52:01.620 --> 52:03.980]  Oh, things I could learn from an elder bat.
[52:04.420 --> 52:07.880]  I think you'd be mostly like crabs and tortoises, wouldn't it?
[52:08.480 --> 52:10.780]  Yeah. What is the oldest animal alive right now?
[52:10.880 --> 52:13.340]  Let's see. I'm going to guess I don't want to go to this beach.
[52:13.420 --> 52:15.040]  Bunch of old ass crabs live here.
[52:15.740 --> 52:17.360]  Boomer Beach is what I call this place.
[52:17.880 --> 52:20.600]  That's got to be like a 250 year old tortoise somewhere.
[52:21.200 --> 52:22.600]  According to Google AI,
[52:23.340 --> 52:26.340]  the oldest living animal on Earth is currently Jonathan,
[52:26.500 --> 52:30.780]  the Seychelles giant tortoise, estimated to be around 192 years old.
[52:31.240 --> 52:32.640]  Damn! I would have thought older.
[52:34.200 --> 52:36.820]  Well, they say he was born around 1832.
[52:38.560 --> 52:41.140]  Fuck, dude, I bet that I bet that dude's got some stories.
[52:42.380 --> 52:43.580]  They're all slow, though.
[52:43.580 --> 52:47.020]  Oh, Christ.
[52:49.140 --> 52:51.020]  I was thinking about animals the other day.
[52:51.580 --> 52:52.460]  Or were you thinking about animals?
[52:52.460 --> 52:54.680]  I wasn't sure if I was going to bring this up to you guys,
[52:54.720 --> 52:57.240]  because it wasn't a fully formed thought yet.
[52:57.520 --> 52:57.940]  Let's form it.
[52:58.260 --> 52:59.660]  Here's what I have written down.
[52:59.840 --> 53:00.980]  And you guys can go from here.
[53:01.540 --> 53:04.360]  Do you guys know how ants are organized and coordinated?
[53:05.140 --> 53:06.820]  Yes. Yeah, they're units.
[53:07.240 --> 53:09.020]  What if other animals were like that?
[53:09.580 --> 53:10.340]  Oh, it's terrifying.
[53:10.840 --> 53:11.660]  It's terrifying, right?
[53:11.660 --> 53:19.280]  Like if birds behaved like ants or hedgehogs or raccoons behaved like ants,
[53:19.400 --> 53:20.740]  that would be terrifying.
[53:21.080 --> 53:24.420]  Isn't a swarm of birds pretty organized?
[53:25.320 --> 53:30.220]  Yeah, but but like all they do is they fly organized and like they go from place
[53:30.220 --> 53:33.980]  to place, they're not like getting fry bags as as a crew.
[53:34.340 --> 53:38.720]  They're not lining up in a in a mile long line
[53:38.720 --> 53:43.940]  and then like taking one piece of sugar cube
[53:43.940 --> 53:48.120]  and handing it to the next guy and just going down the line over and over again.
[53:48.320 --> 53:49.100]  You know what I mean?
[53:49.260 --> 53:53.900]  Or they're they're not tackling problems in that way.
[53:53.920 --> 53:58.040]  Like you see ants that are like build an ant bridge to a piece of food
[53:58.040 --> 54:00.000]  that's like precarious.
[54:00.080 --> 54:02.480]  You're not seeing birds build bird bridges, you know, or you don't see.
[54:02.820 --> 54:05.040]  I don't know. Dogs build dog bridges.
[54:05.040 --> 54:09.320]  No, I just think that we're lucky that other animals
[54:09.320 --> 54:11.720]  aren't as coordinated as ants are.
[54:12.600 --> 54:16.060]  If dogs are like cats got organized, they could take over cities instantly.
[54:16.380 --> 54:17.440]  100 percent. 100 percent.
[54:17.760 --> 54:18.920]  What's that like? That's the thing.
[54:19.020 --> 54:19.800]  It's too. It's like ants.
[54:20.860 --> 54:22.820]  Cool. I'm not too worried about ants.
[54:22.880 --> 54:23.960]  I can eliminate ants.
[54:24.080 --> 54:28.540]  But how much bigger does the organism have to get before it becomes scary?
[54:28.640 --> 54:33.180]  Like if you saw, I don't know, 500 cockroaches in unison doing ant stuff.
[54:33.180 --> 54:34.980]  Oh, my God. That might be scary.
[54:35.340 --> 54:37.060]  You see 500 ants. You don't think twice.
[54:37.140 --> 54:39.780]  You see 500 cockroaches in unison, you might you probably
[54:41.440 --> 54:43.160]  probably need to have yourself think you'd like.
[54:43.280 --> 54:44.360]  I need probably need to be evaluated.
[54:44.520 --> 54:45.900]  I'm clearly losing my mind.
[54:46.180 --> 54:47.180]  Same with like flies.
[54:47.960 --> 54:50.740]  Oh, Jesus. You just start looking for a body
[54:51.220 --> 54:55.180]  like flies marching in order or flying in a single file line.
[54:55.340 --> 54:55.800]  You know what I mean?
[54:56.380 --> 55:00.460]  I wonder how many mosquitoes it would take to drain somebody of blood fully.
[55:00.960 --> 55:02.820]  I bet the Internet knows. Hold on.
[55:03.680 --> 55:05.440]  How many mos...
[55:05.440 --> 55:07.920]  Like if there was like a wave of mosquitoes
[55:07.920 --> 55:11.140]  and you just got bit like 10, like it would be way more than that.
[55:11.180 --> 55:12.620]  Let's say like 100,000 times.
[55:12.940 --> 55:15.360]  Would it look like a big blob of red flying off into the distance?
[55:15.680 --> 55:16.740]  I have an answer.
[55:17.760 --> 55:18.500]  Oh, what? Really?
[55:19.180 --> 55:22.780]  Anybody want to take a guess on how many mosquitoes it takes to drain a human of blood?
[55:22.900 --> 55:24.820]  Dude, I just don't even know where to start.
[55:25.180 --> 55:26.360]  There's four billion.
[55:27.100 --> 55:28.720]  OK. Ten million.
[55:29.520 --> 55:32.140]  Million? I'm going to guess 45,000.
[55:32.780 --> 55:33.700]  What are we doing here?
[55:34.480 --> 55:38.440]  Dude, I think it's I think it's got to be somewhere like like 90.
[55:38.540 --> 55:39.860]  I mean, like really doubling up on Gavin.
[55:39.940 --> 55:41.080]  I think it's gonna be like 90,000.
[55:41.880 --> 55:43.300]  You guys are shooting a little low.
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.000]  It would take approximately 1.2 million mosquitoes
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.780]  to completely drain the average human of their blood.
[55:49.840 --> 55:56.580]  A single mosquito can consume about 0.005 millimeters of blood.
[55:56.580 --> 55:58.920]  But the average human has about five liters.
[55:59.300 --> 56:02.320]  But if I if I splat a mosquito and a bunch of blood goes,
[56:02.820 --> 56:05.820]  are you saying I could have a million splats worth of blood?
[56:06.540 --> 56:08.500]  Well, you'd be pretty weak before.
[56:08.740 --> 56:12.840]  Yeah, you'd probably probably at around 500,000, you'd start to you'd probably
[56:14.280 --> 56:16.680]  you'd probably get pretty tired and do a little less splatting.
[56:17.440 --> 56:20.180]  The only thing I know is it takes 10,000 bee stings to kill a man.
[56:21.180 --> 56:22.480]  It's a firm fact right there.
[56:22.660 --> 56:25.440]  10,000. Tell that to Macaulay Culkin and my girl.
[56:25.900 --> 56:27.080]  Oh, he had an allergy.
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.840]  I was referencing a bear volleyball jackass thing.
[56:31.580 --> 56:31.960]  Oh, yeah.
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.280]  They have like 100,000 bees and their animal experts like takes 10,000.
[56:36.380 --> 56:38.360]  I mean, David was like, What are we doing here?
[56:38.780 --> 56:43.840]  I mean, we've got 10 times as many as he just said it takes to kill somebody.
[56:49.390 --> 56:53.270]  I would be I think the mosquitoes.
[56:53.710 --> 56:54.850]  I don't like mosquitoes.
[56:55.250 --> 56:56.210]  I'd be a lot, but ants.
[56:56.210 --> 56:58.050]  Who doesn't be a problem to you?
[56:58.410 --> 56:59.350]  No, like mosquitoes.
[56:59.470 --> 57:00.430]  Who's pro mosquito?
[57:00.950 --> 57:03.670]  You said that like it was going to be a controversial mosquito.
[57:03.890 --> 57:05.270]  It was a it was a game.
[57:05.370 --> 57:06.390]  They made a game for it.
[57:06.430 --> 57:09.290]  They're they're people that like the mosquitoes mosquito heads out there.
[57:09.430 --> 57:11.650]  I'm on the record as saying I don't like mosquitoes.
[57:12.230 --> 57:13.410]  Sorry if that's controversial.
[57:13.790 --> 57:14.230]  That's what I think.
[57:14.270 --> 57:16.390]  Well, it could be fun, though, if they coordinate like ants,
[57:16.410 --> 57:19.570]  if you have enough of them is imagine like waking up and your bed
[57:19.570 --> 57:22.470]  is in a different place, like they lifted your bed because they're strong
[57:22.470 --> 57:23.450]  as a unit.
[57:23.590 --> 57:24.990]  Sounds scary as hell.
[57:24.990 --> 57:29.030]  Yeah. You just travel places, save on gas.
[57:29.150 --> 57:30.750]  Just get a bunch to lift the car.
[57:30.910 --> 57:34.110]  And I mean, now we're kind of getting in the grounded territory
[57:34.110 --> 57:36.350]  or like I want to be able to control.
[57:36.510 --> 57:40.430]  I guess this is like probably a Marvin villain, a Marvel Marvin.
[57:42.170 --> 57:42.970]  Marvin comics.
[57:44.430 --> 57:47.690]  It would be a Marvin comics is an idea not good enough for Marvel.
[57:47.790 --> 57:50.170]  It's the knockoff offshoot Marvin comics.
[57:50.170 --> 57:55.450]  Uh, the ant, the ant mega mega ant.
[57:55.630 --> 57:56.450]  What would it be?
[57:56.510 --> 57:57.710]  What would the villain name be?
[57:58.290 --> 58:00.570]  Guy who tries to control the ants with his mind.
[58:01.230 --> 58:01.830]  Ant man.
[58:02.330 --> 58:03.910]  But that's already exists.
[58:04.290 --> 58:05.870]  But you want the knockoff?
[58:06.510 --> 58:08.130]  He's friends with Mrs. Miss Marvin.
[58:08.290 --> 58:09.830]  Who's the knockoff Paul Rudd?
[58:10.050 --> 58:10.890]  Yeah, no kidding.
[58:11.010 --> 58:13.230]  Who is the knockoff Paul Rudd?
[58:14.530 --> 58:15.670]  I don't know.
[58:15.770 --> 58:17.210]  Nobody comes to mind for me.
[58:17.310 --> 58:19.310]  Yeah, very specific guy.
[58:19.310 --> 58:23.350]  Who is the guy that played Gambit in Wolverine Origins?
[58:24.710 --> 58:25.630]  Oh, yeah.
[58:25.730 --> 58:26.850]  Who's Channing Tatum?
[58:27.350 --> 58:28.250]  No, no.
[58:28.270 --> 58:30.210]  Taylor Kitsch, Taylor Kitsch.
[58:31.610 --> 58:32.950]  Also the star of Battleship.
[58:34.790 --> 58:35.590]  Yeah, star.
[58:36.070 --> 58:36.870]  Star of Battleship.
[58:37.490 --> 58:38.390]  Never saw that one.
[58:39.350 --> 58:41.570]  Was that the was Rihanna in that movie?
[58:41.590 --> 58:41.970]  She was.
[58:42.010 --> 58:42.610]  That's about the thing.
[58:42.690 --> 58:44.610]  I wonder what Rihanna's film career looks like,
[58:44.670 --> 58:48.350]  because I know she was in Battleship and she's in the Smurfs movie that comes out.
[58:48.750 --> 58:50.850]  Which everybody should see, by the way.
[58:51.690 --> 58:53.910]  Need that movie to make about $350 million.
[58:54.110 --> 58:55.210]  She's in This is the End.
[58:55.690 --> 58:58.930]  I don't think I could name another Rihanna movie, which is sort of surprising.
[58:59.070 --> 59:00.310]  I feel like she's probably been in.
[59:00.970 --> 59:02.050]  Or maybe she stopped.
[59:02.750 --> 59:06.130]  Maybe she made Battleship was like, I got all I need from this acting experience
[59:06.130 --> 59:06.790]  for a little while.
[59:08.050 --> 59:09.050]  Hmm. Let's see.
[59:09.790 --> 59:11.850]  Oh, she was in some other big hitters.
[59:12.030 --> 59:16.110]  She was in Valerian in the city of a thousand whatever planets.
[59:18.350 --> 59:19.310]  What a weird.
[59:20.550 --> 59:23.530]  Battleship to Valerian is such an interesting one deal.
[59:23.870 --> 59:29.670]  She was in a lot of a lot of Ocean's Eight.
[59:29.970 --> 59:31.610]  She was in. Oh, I didn't see that one.
[59:32.130 --> 59:34.150]  Oh, yeah. Bates Motel.
[59:34.310 --> 59:35.810]  She was in two episodes.
[59:36.390 --> 59:40.470]  Do you think we could do a draft of movie directors who forgot how to make movies?
[59:42.510 --> 59:44.430]  Oh, that's very specific.
[59:44.990 --> 59:47.870]  Going from Fifth Element to Valerian would be on my list.
[59:48.670 --> 59:53.030]  Or like directors who made good movies and then disappeared
[59:53.530 --> 59:56.890]  and just didn't make anything else, like Tobe Hooper made two
[59:57.690 --> 01:00:00.430]  of my favorite movies and then disappeared.
[01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.630]  Hmm. Tobe. Tobe Hooper.
[01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.730]  You don't know him? No.
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:09.250]  He's the guy that directed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
[01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:16.350]  Oh, and then he he also directed a movie called Invaders from Mars.
[01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.630]  That is one of my favorite movies of all time.
[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:19.930]  80s like kids horror movie.
[01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:21.270]  Oh, that's fun.
[01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.930]  Yeah, it is fun. It's awesome.
[01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.490]  What's the name of the saw guy?
[01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.890]  Isn't he like Tobe Hooper or something?
[01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:29.630]  Guy that plays Jigsaw.
[01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:31.790]  Tobin Bell. Tobin Bell.
[01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:33.670]  I know. I know there's a Tobin there.
[01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.830]  Good pull, Nick. Thank you.
[01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.570]  That's redemption for the slug right there.
[01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:39.610]  Pulling Tobin Bell.
[01:00:41.010 --> 01:00:41.850]  Slug redemption.
[01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:42.490]  Slug redemption.
[01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.030]  I, uh.
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.250]  I want to watch Changing Lanes.
[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.010]  I just watched The Edge.
[01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.950]  I have a list of movies.
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.630]  That's why I watched The Edge.
[01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:57.290]  Guys, guys, I want to watch Changing Lanes.
[01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:58.230]  Well, let me explain.
[01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.250]  I have a list of movies and The Edge was one of them.
[01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:04.570]  Were there movie store movies where I've never heard anyone talk about them?
[01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:07.990]  I've just seen the poster a lot and I don't know anyone who's seen them.
[01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:10.130]  I've never heard any discourse around them.
[01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.050]  And Changing Lanes is one of those for me.
[01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.430]  Don't know what it's about.
[01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.470]  Don't know anyone who's seen it.
[01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:17.810]  Have never heard anybody talk about it.
[01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.030]  Feels like it could be a fake movie, but I've seen it so many times.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:23.150]  That that poster.
[01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:24.590]  That's all I know.
[01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:26.110]  It's a Ben Affleck movie. Oh, yeah.
[01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.790]  Ben Affleck, Samuel Jackson.
[01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.390]  They're probably changing lanes.
[01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:32.930]  I don't know anything else about it, but I'm excited to watch it.
[01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.970]  It's been my my recent how I've been watching movies.
[01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:40.430]  The Edge was a similar thing of like, I know bears and fall, but that's all I know.
[01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.670]  I don't know what this is.
[01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:46.290]  Similarly, I stumbled into a movie that I'm going to watch
[01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:49.490]  called Death Valley that I just bought on Blu-ray.
[01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:55.750]  OK. And it stars a young Peter Billingsley
[01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.650]  before he was in.
[01:01:58.830 --> 01:01:59.930]  I'm assuming it was before.
[01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.410]  Hold on. Let me I'm trying to find the poster.
[01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.770]  What is this movie? Death Valley.
[01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:05.310]  Has anyone seen Changing Lanes?
[01:02:05.310 --> 01:02:06.490]  Well, you're pulling that up.
[01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.150]  No, no, no.
[01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:09.950]  See, nobody's seen this fucking movie.
[01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:11.850]  No, but it was all I know about it.
[01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.190]  I've just never, you know, I've never seen it.
[01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.510]  Weird. What's your Death Valley about?
[01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.130]  So it's Peter Billingsley.
[01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:19.670]  He's a young kid.
[01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:23.090]  He's imagine him a little bit younger than in his role in a Christmas story.
[01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:26.630]  He he lives with his dad, like in New York.
[01:02:26.730 --> 01:02:27.590]  I'm just going off the trailer.
[01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:30.590]  And his mom remarries or has a new boyfriend,
[01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:34.190]  and he has to go spend a vacation with his mom and her new boyfriend.
[01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:35.070]  And it's like.
[01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.750]  Billy thought the worst thing he would do today
[01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:42.930]  would be to say goodbye to his father or maybe having to get to know
[01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.070]  his mother's new boyfriend.
[01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:46.870]  But the worst thing he's going to have to do today is survive.
[01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.890]  And then it's up.
[01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:52.570]  He and his mom and his mom's boyfriend go to Death Valley on a vacation.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:56.390]  To drive, I don't know, just driving through nothing in Death Valley,
[01:02:56.490 --> 01:03:00.750]  but a serial killer latches onto them and chases them down and tries to kill them.
[01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.430]  And it's all about Peter Billingsley at like eight years old,
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:05.270]  running from a serial killer in the desert.
[01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:08.390]  Isn't that where the Undertaker's from? Death Valley?
[01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:13.250]  I believe so. Yeah, for all I know, for all I know, he's the serial killer.
[01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:14.250]  I haven't seen it yet.
[01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.390]  But I hope he saves them.
[01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:17.930]  The tagline is not even a scream escape.
[01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:18.710]  So that's pretty cool.
[01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:22.890]  So maybe while you watch Changing Lanes, I'll watch my Blu-ray of Death Valley.
[01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.870]  Ah shit, what dog shit should I watch?
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:29.190]  Do you not have movies that you've seen posters of, Gavin,
[01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.150]  that you just like you don't know anything about?
[01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:32.330]  The Klumps.
[01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.430]  The Klumps is a great one.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:36.530]  It's a great one.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:38.430]  You should watch The Klumps.
[01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:40.250]  Oh, man, really?
[01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.150]  I don't want to watch The Klumps.
[01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:45.450]  You said it, dude.
[01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:46.470]  You said it, man.
[01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:47.190]  It's too late.
[01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:48.630]  You brought it up.
[01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:51.030]  Oh, what about Sliding Doors?
[01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.010]  Has anyone seen that?
[01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.610]  I don't even know what Sliding Doors is.
[01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:56.630]  No, I don't think I've seen Sliding Doors.
[01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:58.730]  It's Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:02.230]  And it's like a whole thing where like if she if she got on the train,
[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.410]  her life would have been different.
[01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:04.530]  And then she dies or something.
[01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.490]  She'd like be a brunette, I think, is like the difference.
[01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:08.750]  Like she had a different haircut.
[01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:14.250]  See, to me, Sliding Doors is like a changing lanes ass type of movie name.
[01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:15.730]  Yes, that's what I thought.
[01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:19.990]  Do you think that Eddie Murphy had like one bad,
[01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:24.450]  one bad movie with a co-star, like he had one bad experience
[01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:28.190]  and it was like never again and just decided that he would be all of his co-stars?
[01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:33.050]  It's such a weird thing that he has so many movies where he's playing
[01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:35.370]  like all nine of the characters that are in.
[01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:36.790]  When did he first do it?
[01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:38.790]  Was it coming to America?
[01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.510]  Oh, probably coming to America. Yeah.
[01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:44.090]  I assumed he was like,
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:48.970]  if I don't cast anybody else in this film, I can keep all the extra money.
[01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:53.310]  If I play every character, I'll just I'll just be I'll just get.
[01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:56.490]  Yeah, I'm just going to get I'm just gonna pay myself for each role I'm in.
[01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.810]  What if it was like an all time scam where they didn't know it was him
[01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:01.430]  playing all the roles when they hired?
[01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:05.510]  Like the casting director just thought he was meeting six different actors.
[01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:08.350]  And the studio was like, wow, we got a lot of new people
[01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.390]  we've never heard of in this movie.
[01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.370]  Eddie Murphy really trying to bring new people in.
[01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.990]  We're giving out a lot of SAG cards, it looks like in this thing.
[01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:18.050]  And it's just him.
[01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.210]  He's in SAG eight times.
[01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.410]  I'd like to imagine it continued off screen
[01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:29.310]  or like he had a chef character he would play and he'd make the meals.
[01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.670]  Like it's just Eddie Murphy profiting every way he can.
[01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:34.530]  He's taking every job.
[01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:40.090]  I would love to know if if Eddie Murphy ever dreams about other people he's played.
[01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:43.290]  Or does he like he's he is those people?
[01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:46.110]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:50.890]  I want to see a remake in the movie Identity, but with the cast of the clumps.
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:06:00.140]  I want all the alternate personalities to just be clumps characters.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.920]  Is the original Nutty Professor?
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.120]  Are they called the clumps in that?
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800]  I don't think I ever.
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:12.580]  Well, I think I watched it as a child and I don't remember anything about it.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:14.580]  I mean, like the the old old one.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.980]  Oh, the original, not his first.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.120]  Yeah, because I assume he was still a clump in the first one.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.160]  But was the original character the clump?
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.140]  Yeah. But do you think the clumps were in the first one
[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:26.120]  or do you think they brought the clumps in for the second one?
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120]  I mean, he was a clump, wasn't he?
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.740]  Wasn't he always a clump?
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.220]  I'm assuming he was always a clump.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:36.540]  But I'm I'm curious if this cast of characters were in the first.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.300]  If he's a clump, he's got to come from a line of clumps.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.660]  Oh, you definitely will.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.340]  But I was curious if the line of clumps was in the first
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.440]  or if we're getting introduced to all these clumps in the second.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.980]  I'm pretty sure all the a lot of the clumps are in the first one.
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.340]  Then why make?
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.320]  I don't. I mean, I haven't seen the Nutty Professor
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.140]  just feels like a weird thing to be like, you know what?
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.400]  The second thing we're going to make a sequel.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:05.780]  And instead of it being like about goofy science, let's focus in on the clumps.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.160]  I think that people really want some clumps in their life.
[01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:13.560]  Jerry Lewis's name in the first Nutty Professor is Professor Julius Kelp.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.340]  So the sequel would have been the kelps.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.440]  Yeah. So he went from kelp to clump.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.280]  They modernized it.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.640]  His alternate ego is buddy love.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.040]  That's why he's the cool guy.
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.500]  Well, he's buddy love in the new one, too.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.040]  But yeah, so you've seen it.
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.120]  I've seen the first clump.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:31.520]  I've seen the first Nutty Professor.
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:34.100]  I've seen the first clump.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.520]  I've seen the first clump.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.160]  I've seen OG clump where he's buddy love.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.340]  And then I've never seen you've never seen OG kelp.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.600]  I've never seen kelp.
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.740]  And I've never seen Nutty Professor to the clumps.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.940]  Would you rather watch Nutty Professor to the clumps
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.680]  or the original Nutty Professor starring Jerry Lewis?
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.060]  The original Nutty Professor.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.320]  Well, maybe that should be the movie you watch.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.900]  Eric's going to watch Sliding Doors.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:07:59.840]  You're going to watch Nutty Professor.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.600]  I didn't say I wanted to watch Sliding Doors.
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.980]  I don't want to watch Sliding Doors.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.000]  Why do I have to watch Sliding Doors?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:05.860]  Because you posted it.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.340]  And then Nick's going to watch something, too.
[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:08.480]  Nick, what are you going to watch?
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.960]  Oh, that's a good question.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.060]  You remember your bitching about watching Sliding Doors.
[01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.520]  That was a well-reviewed movie.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.380]  I wasn't the one who brought it up!
[01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.400]  I brought up Sliding Doors.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.080]  What? I didn't have anything.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.140]  I posted the picture.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.960]  I posted pictures of a bear.
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.880]  I posted changing lanes.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.160]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:28.300]  Picture posting is nine tenths of the law.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:29.540]  Oh, my God.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.640]  Did they do a Nutty Professor 3?
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.700]  Did we ever see the clumps again?
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:39.400]  I think we need to get the clumps back.
[01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.300]  I can't believe you never saw the first one.
[01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:43.760]  I feel like every kid rented that for a birthday.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.120]  I think I may have seen it in theaters as a kid, but like, I don't remember about it.
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.760]  Did they have toys for the Nutty Professor?
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:53.960]  I feel like I may got like a Happy Meal toy or like a Burger King toy for them.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.100]  Do you remember a bit where he's massive and he farts and there's an explosion?
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.500]  No. He's like the size of a building.
[01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:03.940]  That might have been a dream sequence.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.960]  I'm not sure if that was canon to the story.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.000]  No. I don't.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.940]  Yeah, I can't. I don't have any memories of the Nutty Professor.
[01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:15.220]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.540]  I have to take a shit.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.260]  Let's end this. Wrap up.
[01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.120]  I keep sending a message to wrap up.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.100]  I keep saying it.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:23.520]  Yeah, but this isn't right.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.700]  I've taken five shits today already.
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.120]  Oh, that's uh-oh.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:29.260]  How do I have to take a sixth shit?
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.920]  It's what? It's 1.16 in the afternoon.
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:32.980]  Yeah, road trip.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.900]  You can't travel, but sometimes.
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.580]  Yeah, but it didn't hit me till today.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.060]  I got home at noon yesterday.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.580]  Speaking of which, I had a really good time driving from Austin
[01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:44.280]  to Michigan. That's not a bad drive.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.400]  I mean, it's like a two day drive.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.600]  But I will say this.
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.560]  Little Rock, Arkansas and Texarkana are.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.180]  Dog shit.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.100]  But no offense to anybody who lives there.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.320]  But man, not great places to hang out.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.940]  Is there a little rock and little rock like there is a round rock
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.220]  and round rock that isn't that real?
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.080]  Is there a little rock that isn't that little?
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.040]  Name a place that doesn't have a little rock.
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.040]  Mars. Oh, that's a bad one.
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:17.800]  We're going to guys, we're going to wrap this up as we go out.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.920]  We're going to learn a little bit about the Little Rock.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.240]  Little Rock, it is a now reduced stone outcrop projecting in the Arkansas
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.180]  River from its south bank in the city's waterfront area adjacent to Junction
[01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.480]  Bridge. I think I was actually by Junction Bridge, whose foundations
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.060]  include a portion of the rock.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:40.320]  Yeah, so I guess it's kind of gone, but there is a bronze plaque mounted on it.
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.180]  Hell yeah.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.380]  The original original rock was 18 feet above the river.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.000]  Hmm. We should buy one of those rest in peace benches,
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.460]  but just put the clumps on it.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.800]  What do you mean put the clumps on it?
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:53.580]  Just write the clumps.
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.460]  I think I just think it's funny that there's a clumps bench.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:57.780]  That just makes me happy.
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:01.780]  Premise that like you sit at a bench and you're like,
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.620]  Oh, who is this in dedication to?
[01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:04.520]  Oh, the clumps.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.480]  So you want to dedicate just a bench in, but does it have to be in Little Rock?
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.780]  A Little Rock could be anywhere.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.800]  It doesn't even have to be a legal bench.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.920]  We could just put a bench somewhere that says the clumps on.
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.120]  Ain't nobody stopping benches.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.140]  I feel like we should just put all these dog shit movies on a wheel and watch one of them.
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.280]  We could end up watching the clumps.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.640]  Why? We can't even finish Charmed.
[01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:31.040]  Yeah, well, maybe after we finish Charmed, we could do that.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.040]  If somebody would let us finish it.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.360]  You're real worked up about watching more Charmed.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.060]  I don't think that's the reason we're worked up, bud.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:43.000]  You're acting like episode three is coming out next week.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.920]  I can't figure out, honestly,
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.280]  maybe you guys can help me out here as we as we end this episode.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.000]  I can't figure out if Gavin is rescheduling Charmed episode three
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.720]  because of just scheduling issues or because he can't bring himself
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.520]  to watch any more of it, and he just needs a buffer.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.720]  Well, let me let me tell you something that might blow your mind.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.980]  I had a really good time making Wheel of Decades.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:09.740]  I enjoyed it.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.860]  I enjoyed the hell out of it, but nobody else seemed to in the process of it.
[01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:19.350]  I like...
[01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:24.210]  All right.
[01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:27.870]  Well, let's go ahead and take old Yeller back around the barn
[01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:29.550]  and put a bullet in its head.
[01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:33.510]  It's got mange and rabies and well, I spoiled it for you, unfortunately.
[01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.030]  Oh, we're going to have to put it down.
[01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:40.890]  Much like episode 64 of the Regulation podcast.
[01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.250]  It is in the ground.
[01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:46.870]  We are throwing dirt over it and some old ladies crying in the corner.
[01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:48.650]  There's Vaseline everywhere.
[01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:53.030]  The dirt is covered in Vaseline and you'll be covered in Vaseline, too.
[01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:57.890]  And, Glory, if you tune in next week for episode 65 of the Regulation podcast,
[01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:58.850]  don't forget we have a Patreon.
