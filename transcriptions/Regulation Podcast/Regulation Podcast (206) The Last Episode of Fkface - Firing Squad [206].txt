[00:10.400 --> 00:12.840]  Hello and welcome to another episode.
[00:14.140 --> 00:17.180]  The final episode of the F*** Face podcast.
[00:17.420 --> 00:21.300]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Frey,
[00:22.680 --> 00:24.540]  Gracie, Nick and Eric as well.
[00:24.720 --> 00:26.820]  This is episode 206.
[00:26.960 --> 00:29.700]  This will go down in history as our 205th episode.
[00:31.100 --> 00:32.040]  How's everybody doing?
[00:32.820 --> 00:35.100]  I know what I'm glad that you brought that up.
[00:35.140 --> 00:36.260]  Sorry, Gavin, go ahead.
[00:36.400 --> 00:38.320]  You say your thing because I think you're going to say good.
[00:39.720 --> 00:41.820]  I said pretty, and then now I'm going to say good.
[00:42.360 --> 00:43.040]  Thanks for asking.
[00:43.660 --> 00:44.200]  You're welcome.
[00:44.980 --> 00:46.180]  I'm glad you're pretty good, man.
[00:46.360 --> 00:47.400]  Well, you didn't know right about you.
[00:48.800 --> 00:53.360]  Well, Geoff, I was just trying to get credit for a thing I didn't do.
[00:53.460 --> 00:56.140]  I don't know why you call me out like that is very rude of you.
[00:58.060 --> 01:00.520]  I got some stuff, I guess, to unpack.
[01:01.480 --> 01:02.420]  This is the end.
[01:02.600 --> 01:04.920]  I gave some some of it last episode.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.560]  I've had this has been, I mean, obviously a difficult time for all of us,
[01:09.560 --> 01:10.740]  for a variety of reasons.
[01:11.260 --> 01:15.840]  I maybe have uniquely suffered in a way that I have not shared with anyone here.
[01:16.300 --> 01:20.560]  Do you guys remember episode one ninety six?
[01:21.000 --> 01:21.960]  Remember that a long time ago?
[01:22.300 --> 01:23.940]  We're going to do that whole thing. Yeah.
[01:24.020 --> 01:27.520]  And do you remember how I got a Herman Miller chair
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.720]  as part of, you know, yeah, yeah, things for it.
[01:32.980 --> 01:36.280]  I plan on sitting in my Herman Miller for the first time
[01:36.280 --> 01:41.040]  during one ninety six because we had this whole thing planned.
[01:41.280 --> 01:45.960]  And while you were all uncomfortable, I would be very comfortable.
[01:46.520 --> 01:52.200]  But then one ninety six got canceled and then the company died.
[01:52.320 --> 01:58.100]  So I am still using my shitty chair and have yet to touch my Herman Miller.
[01:58.340 --> 02:02.500]  That's which I have, which I've had for months now.
[02:02.700 --> 02:04.600]  That's if it's still in the box. Ridiculous.
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.700]  No, I it's just loose in the other room and I haven't been using it.
[02:10.100 --> 02:12.980]  And it is. Oh, my back.
[02:13.160 --> 02:14.540]  I hate this stuff.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.100]  This shit stool.
[02:16.440 --> 02:17.920]  Can you change it right now?
[02:18.040 --> 02:20.900]  Can you go over? No, because it doesn't make sense because we're.
[02:21.040 --> 02:23.680]  No, he's he's the last one. He's right.
[02:24.040 --> 02:25.780]  Yeah. So be comfortable for the end.
[02:26.140 --> 02:28.400]  No, I'll be comfortable on the new thing.
[02:28.920 --> 02:31.500]  Yeah, I'm going to start Herman Miller on the new one.
[02:32.000 --> 02:33.440]  I yeah, I think so. I think I might.
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.500]  Should we try to release episode one ninety six in the new thing then?
[02:39.280 --> 02:40.420]  Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
[02:40.580 --> 02:41.840]  OK. All right.
[02:42.100 --> 02:46.000]  So let's get let's prioritize that so that Andrew can sit in his chair sooner
[02:46.000 --> 02:46.480]  than later.
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.600]  Then it will have the opposite problem, whatever you like.
[02:48.680 --> 02:50.020]  Welcome to episode twelve.
[02:50.120 --> 02:52.060]  The eleventh podcast of our
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.720]  welcome to help us at twelve.
[02:54.820 --> 02:57.180]  Our thirteenth podcast. Yeah, that's fine.
[02:57.700 --> 02:58.800]  I think it's very us.
[02:59.200 --> 03:00.560]  Feels a hundred percent us.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.980]  Or we just slot it in after episode one hundred ninety five.
[03:05.120 --> 03:05.900]  That's it also.
[03:06.180 --> 03:07.840]  That's also great. That's also great.
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.620]  I well, and that that actually that that should be reassuring to the audience
[03:12.620 --> 03:15.620]  because that's us telling the audience, listen, we plan on this one
[03:15.620 --> 03:17.480]  going at least one hundred ninety five episodes.
[03:18.380 --> 03:19.080]  That would be the goal.
[03:19.960 --> 03:23.360]  Yeah. Should we start a new podcast every two hundred and six,
[03:23.520 --> 03:24.800]  aka two hundred five episodes?
[03:25.160 --> 03:27.500]  No, I fucking quit.
[03:31.380 --> 03:35.340]  I I feel it's also I gave a little bit of a clue last episode.
[03:35.460 --> 03:38.600]  I'm ready to reveal my long awaited Easter egg.
[03:39.280 --> 03:39.940]  Eight months.
[03:40.600 --> 03:43.320]  Geoff, you made fun saying fun of me saying it was nine months ago.
[03:43.720 --> 03:45.000]  I added some months to that.
[03:45.120 --> 03:46.980]  I wanted to. Oh, clever boy.
[03:47.820 --> 03:49.880]  Clever. This is eight months old.
[03:50.320 --> 03:51.520]  It has been discovered.
[03:52.080 --> 03:55.360]  How many how many places have eight times
[03:55.880 --> 03:58.520]  by people that I guess just didn't know what it is.
[03:59.160 --> 04:02.460]  The day we recorded our potato facts episode,
[04:03.020 --> 04:05.800]  there is a time I think we're making fun of you, Geoff, for having a million
[04:05.800 --> 04:07.420]  other podcasts. Yeah.
[04:07.760 --> 04:09.240]  There's something about that.
[04:09.580 --> 04:12.880]  And I think Eric said, what's the name of your podcast to me?
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.100]  And I said that it would be called the first permanent potato patches
[04:18.100 --> 04:20.900]  on U.S. soil were established in 1719 here in Leningrad, New Hampshire.
[04:21.300 --> 04:22.320]  I read the fact again.
[04:23.380 --> 04:24.800]  People assume that was a joke.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.320]  I later that day made a podcast episode.
[04:28.520 --> 04:31.780]  Called that and uploaded it to.
[04:32.020 --> 04:32.740]  Oh, that's the wrong.
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.140]  I'm on the wrong computer.
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.900]  Yeah, that was, hey, going out the way I started with the wrong links.
[04:39.120 --> 04:41.640]  I got I'm using two computers I made.
[04:41.940 --> 04:46.180]  So that fact was taken from a giant list of facts about potatoes.
[04:46.620 --> 04:51.220]  And I recorded myself reading that list and giving just general potato musings.
[04:51.480 --> 04:54.480]  It's been around for eight months waiting to be found.
[04:55.060 --> 05:00.140]  So you get a little bonus potato podcast on your way out for the people to enjoy.
[05:00.260 --> 05:02.540]  It's 15 minutes long.
[05:02.660 --> 05:06.340]  I thought about making several, but I just thought it's one's enough.
[05:06.600 --> 05:10.060]  And I waited, hoping that someone would look into it
[05:10.060 --> 05:13.420]  because I do say my podcast is and then gave the name.
[05:13.840 --> 05:15.960]  But it was never discovered.
[05:16.720 --> 05:18.800]  The first potato patch on U.S. soil.
[05:18.840 --> 05:19.460]  This is the description.
[05:19.600 --> 05:22.660]  We're establishing nine foot nil in Derry, New Hampshire by Scottish Irish immigrants.
[05:22.660 --> 05:23.720]  Please subscribe.
[05:30.190 --> 05:34.010]  I don't think I got any subscribers, unfortunately, but
[05:35.250 --> 05:37.890]  I've just been sitting on that for a while waiting.
[05:38.550 --> 05:40.630]  That's fucking brilliant.
[05:41.290 --> 05:42.470]  Absolutely brilliant.
[05:42.470 --> 05:43.350]  People like it.
[05:43.550 --> 05:45.350]  Hopefully people enjoy the potato facts.
[05:45.990 --> 05:48.130]  Have you had any interest from advertisers?
[05:48.990 --> 05:51.330]  Oh, no, no, I haven't.
[05:51.330 --> 05:54.770]  It turns out of the eight people that have listened to it,
[05:54.910 --> 05:57.070]  none of them were interested or were advertisers.
[05:57.410 --> 05:59.430]  How did eight people find this?
[05:59.930 --> 06:00.650]  I don't know.
[06:00.930 --> 06:02.250]  But I mean, it's been eight.
[06:02.410 --> 06:03.830]  It's been out for eight months at this point.
[06:03.890 --> 06:06.250]  So one a month, it gets, I guess, the average.
[06:06.690 --> 06:09.290]  Are you sure that's not just you checking on it once a month?
[06:09.410 --> 06:13.690]  No, because I I made that announcement that I still had this
[06:13.690 --> 06:17.030]  like that I had an Easter egg in the wild and I hadn't thought about it
[06:17.030 --> 06:18.450]  for five months at that point.
[06:18.570 --> 06:20.650]  And I had the so I wasn't checking.
[06:20.650 --> 06:22.290]  I've checked on it probably three times.
[06:24.510 --> 06:26.970]  So that is that I'm trying to think, do I have anything else?
[06:27.030 --> 06:29.630]  I told the Gavin Slack thing that the store.
[06:31.690 --> 06:32.870]  I think that's it.
[06:32.930 --> 06:33.710]  Do you guys have anything?
[06:34.070 --> 06:38.970]  I do. I like I have some like a cleaning house type things.
[06:39.210 --> 06:40.170]  I have two things.
[06:40.230 --> 06:43.890]  One, I've just I was I've been trying to be reflective
[06:43.890 --> 06:46.010]  of the last couple of years.
[06:46.090 --> 06:48.230]  I mean, it's weird, right, because we're continuing.
[06:48.230 --> 06:51.470]  We're going to continue doing like we're just going to get together
[06:51.470 --> 06:53.150]  next Thursday and record the next podcast.
[06:53.370 --> 06:54.750]  It'll just be called something different.
[06:55.150 --> 06:57.790]  So really nothing is going to change other than some branding.
[06:58.230 --> 07:00.710]  But it still is like the end of a thing.
[07:00.810 --> 07:04.370]  And I've wanted to certainly like the end of an era.
[07:04.810 --> 07:09.210]  Maybe like this is the first tome of of because we've already gone
[07:09.210 --> 07:12.630]  through all the chapters and fucking all that nonsense.
[07:12.990 --> 07:16.570]  And I was I was thinking about like moments that stood out to me
[07:16.570 --> 07:20.690]  and just like crazy coincidences or things that just made me feel like.
[07:22.770 --> 07:26.210]  Made me feel like the universe was telling me that we were doing something.
[07:27.230 --> 07:29.590]  That I should continue to invest everything into,
[07:29.690 --> 07:32.430]  like something special or that it mattered or that I should pay attention
[07:32.430 --> 07:36.270]  because what we were doing was was honestly something important,
[07:36.450 --> 07:39.510]  at least to me, and we've talked about this a lot in the past,
[07:40.190 --> 07:44.910]  you know, especially for like the first two years doing this podcast kept me sane.
[07:44.910 --> 07:45.850]  It was my guess.
[07:46.470 --> 07:47.910]  And I think it was for y'all as well.
[07:48.330 --> 07:48.830]  Absolutely.
[07:48.970 --> 07:51.530]  Because we were all navigating a lot of different challenges in our lives,
[07:51.610 --> 07:54.570]  some pandemic related, but also a lot that had nothing to do with it.
[07:54.890 --> 07:58.350]  And so it's been an important
[07:59.730 --> 08:02.430]  foundation in who I am now.
[08:02.530 --> 08:04.610]  And it's it's it is also like.
[08:05.630 --> 08:08.450]  Helped my friendship with Eric and Nick grow
[08:08.450 --> 08:12.110]  and and brought Gracie into all of our lives.
[08:12.110 --> 08:17.150]  And it is only strengthened the triangle that is Gavin, Geoff and Andrew
[08:17.150 --> 08:18.950]  in the most unexpected and wonderful ways.
[08:19.350 --> 08:21.270]  And so I was trying to think back of just like one or two moments
[08:21.270 --> 08:22.290]  that just really stood out to me.
[08:22.550 --> 08:25.990]  And the one that really that really comes to mind.
[08:26.050 --> 08:28.490]  And it's not a crazy moment.
[08:28.690 --> 08:31.870]  But when Emily and I went to surprise y'all
[08:32.450 --> 08:36.530]  and we went to Key West like in the July 4th weekend, we went
[08:37.110 --> 08:39.950]  and showed up on the camera and everybody noticed us in three seconds.
[08:39.950 --> 08:41.310]  And it was awesome and gratifying.
[08:42.050 --> 08:45.290]  And it was wild because, you know, we were sloppy.
[08:45.350 --> 08:46.850]  Just being already existed on that.
[08:47.050 --> 08:49.190]  But when we turned the corner
[08:49.930 --> 08:53.510]  and saw the hot dog man selling hot dogs.
[08:54.310 --> 08:58.770]  And he was also selling merchandise that said, hey, face
[08:59.350 --> 09:02.150]  like he was selling the T-shirts that say, hey, face.
[09:02.190 --> 09:06.210]  And he was selling the the apron that says, hey, face.
[09:06.270 --> 09:07.890]  And it had nothing to do with us.
[09:07.890 --> 09:10.650]  It looked like a North Face logo that was like rebranded.
[09:10.710 --> 09:14.830]  It was like his kitsch that he was doing alongside of alongside of hot dogs.
[09:14.930 --> 09:16.070]  And I was just standing there thinking,
[09:16.590 --> 09:21.050]  out of all the places on the planet Earth for a man to sell hot dogs
[09:21.050 --> 09:25.550]  and hey, face merchandise, it's around the corner
[09:25.550 --> 09:28.730]  from the place that I didn't know existed four months ago
[09:28.730 --> 09:32.710]  that my fiance at the time, wife now, and I decided on a whim
[09:32.710 --> 09:35.990]  to fly across America to go visit in person
[09:35.990 --> 09:40.390]  just to stand under a camera to hopefully entertain
[09:40.910 --> 09:43.110]  some members of our podcast community.
[09:43.610 --> 09:46.810]  And I get to turn the corner and right there is the universe saying, hey, face.
[09:47.710 --> 09:49.650]  This is something I felt.
[09:49.770 --> 09:53.050]  It felt like such a moment in my life where I thought we're
[09:53.050 --> 09:56.570]  we can't ever stop this, what we're doing.
[09:57.010 --> 10:00.690]  This is the universe like gently telling me constantly in little ways.
[10:00.970 --> 10:02.970]  Hey, you're on the right path. Keep doing it.
[10:02.970 --> 10:05.030]  Which is why we're not going to fucking stop doing face.
[10:05.030 --> 10:06.410]  We're going to call it something else.
[10:06.550 --> 10:09.350]  But what we're doing is never going to stop.
[10:09.810 --> 10:13.490]  And I just wondered if you if you guys have I've been trying to
[10:13.950 --> 10:17.670]  vamp this a little bit to give you guys time to think if anything like that pops up.
[10:18.290 --> 10:22.190]  I do love that, though, that just being told by the universe
[10:22.190 --> 10:24.450]  that all your energy is going in the right direction.
[10:24.830 --> 10:26.030]  100%. Yeah.
[10:26.290 --> 10:28.350]  And I and I really felt it in that moment.
[10:29.150 --> 10:29.610]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10:29.670 --> 10:32.310]  It's I had a different where obviously I had so much fun.
[10:32.770 --> 10:38.490]  I was so worried about screwing up the show when we started that I it was this weird
[10:39.390 --> 10:41.630]  section, I remember of like probably.
[10:42.110 --> 10:46.150]  I don't know when it stopped being stressful to make, but it did happen.
[10:46.250 --> 10:49.610]  It was probably like 140 ish, I would assume.
[10:50.190 --> 10:52.730]  But I just remember when I was starting, like I'd have so much fun
[10:52.730 --> 10:53.870]  as soon as we were done.
[10:53.950 --> 10:57.830]  But just thinking like, I can't wait for me to do 100 of these.
[10:58.010 --> 11:00.450]  So it isn't it doesn't feel like a thing.
[11:00.890 --> 11:06.150]  And then getting to that point of it's just been the most ridiculous playground
[11:06.770 --> 11:12.250]  in the best way of, as you said, like difficult years.
[11:12.270 --> 11:17.770]  But just knowing that there is this space that we would get to make each other laugh
[11:17.770 --> 11:20.950]  invaluable, so appreciated.
[11:22.630 --> 11:26.690]  I don't have, but I never turned a corner and saw a hot dog man
[11:26.690 --> 11:29.210]  that said, hey, face on it.
[11:29.210 --> 11:34.310]  I wish I had something so obnoxiously on the nose,
[11:34.910 --> 11:36.850]  but I don't. I'm trying to.
[11:37.010 --> 11:41.910]  The moment that I had to call Gavin and tell him that I got Wilford Brimley
[11:41.910 --> 11:42.670]  confused
[11:45.670 --> 11:47.170]  with the other dude
[11:47.810 --> 11:51.210]  and that the whole world was going to find out how it was going to hear
[11:51.210 --> 11:55.150]  how dumb I was and being happy, embarrassed, but also happy
[11:55.150 --> 11:59.290]  that everybody on Earth got to, that was going to hear how fucking stupid I am.
[12:00.150 --> 12:04.270]  That was a particularly good moment, too, because I felt safe.
[12:04.610 --> 12:05.650]  I felt like it's OK.
[12:06.330 --> 12:08.390]  They're going to get it.
[12:08.590 --> 12:09.490]  It's going to be fine.
[12:09.650 --> 12:12.270]  And it's going to be it's going to be too entertaining not to cut.
[12:12.590 --> 12:17.630]  I remember having a really nice moment when this was like at the end of 2020
[12:17.630 --> 12:20.910]  when like a bunch of, I don't know, it was like a shit time.
[12:21.150 --> 12:22.850]  I remember just being bummed out quite a lot.
[12:22.850 --> 12:27.170]  And I think it was during the recording, Andrew, where you were,
[12:27.490 --> 12:31.090]  where you were just talking about how every time you come to us,
[12:31.130 --> 12:32.550]  didn't you roll an ankle?
[12:32.850 --> 12:34.310]  And I was just pissing.
[12:34.430 --> 12:35.590]  I was pissing myself.
[12:35.850 --> 12:38.630]  And I remember laughing so much and tears were streaming down my face.
[12:38.830 --> 12:43.270]  I just took a picture of my own face because I was like, I have not laughed
[12:43.850 --> 12:46.430]  this hard in years probably.
[12:46.670 --> 12:48.530]  And I just remember thinking that was a nice moment.
[12:48.670 --> 12:49.930]  So I just snapped my own head.
[12:49.930 --> 12:52.510]  Every time I was miserable,
[12:53.390 --> 12:57.230]  absolutely miserable physically due to being in Austin.
[12:57.450 --> 13:02.190]  When you guys flew me out to do the raid, I got so fucking sick.
[13:02.350 --> 13:04.410]  On the second day, I'm coughing.
[13:04.830 --> 13:08.490]  You guys had to get me cough medicine to record the battlefront.
[13:08.510 --> 13:10.350]  Let's play. It was a mess.
[13:10.710 --> 13:15.270]  Every time I couldn't make it to Austin without dying in some capacity.
[13:16.710 --> 13:17.870]  Rolling ankles.
[13:19.450 --> 13:23.350]  One here at RTX, literally everybody got the flu and it's just a mess.
[13:23.750 --> 13:25.730]  I couldn't. I would go to RTX.
[13:25.850 --> 13:30.450]  I'd spend like 14 days as my RTX trip because I knew the first seven
[13:30.450 --> 13:32.010]  I would be dead in some way.
[13:32.330 --> 13:35.450]  And so I needed time to be there when I wasn't sick or hurt.
[13:35.970 --> 13:39.870]  Those were your your the story of your journey was always the best
[13:39.870 --> 13:41.170]  fucking thing to listen to, though.
[13:41.190 --> 13:44.410]  It was always so complicated and harder than it needed to be.
[13:44.450 --> 13:46.450]  And it took longer and it was convoluted.
[13:46.450 --> 13:48.230]  And there was like seven missteps.
[13:48.530 --> 13:52.290]  And you ended up at the behest of strangers multiple times.
[13:52.370 --> 13:54.250]  It was always a wild adventure.
[13:54.450 --> 14:00.730]  Well, I guess that picture I just showed was the same week as extra life
[14:00.730 --> 14:03.650]  because I just found a picture of my bruised legs.
[14:04.270 --> 14:06.810]  But it really looks like I have a vagina.
[14:07.010 --> 14:08.430]  I'm not sure I can even post it.
[14:11.630 --> 14:13.050]  I don't know if I should post it.
[14:13.070 --> 14:14.010]  Like the bruises?
[14:14.990 --> 14:18.950]  No, I'm like, I'm like, I think I've got nothing on.
[14:19.030 --> 14:20.410]  So I'm cupping my bollocks.
[14:21.050 --> 14:22.870]  Should I just post it and delete it?
[14:22.950 --> 14:23.830]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[14:23.850 --> 14:24.970]  Don't delete it, though. We're good.
[14:25.630 --> 14:27.350]  Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, screenshot.
[14:30.230 --> 14:31.190]  It does.
[14:31.610 --> 14:35.130]  You, I don't, I mean, you described what it is.
[14:35.230 --> 14:36.610]  Oh, that's so funny.
[14:36.850 --> 14:41.590]  Somehow it's still undersold of exactly how it looks,
[14:41.590 --> 14:44.670]  which is exactly what you described.
[14:46.150 --> 14:47.290]  It's my fingers.
[14:47.510 --> 14:48.550]  It's like I'm cupping.
[14:48.810 --> 14:50.170]  Sure, man. Yeah, whatever you say.
[14:50.490 --> 14:52.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude, that's your fingers. Sure, dude.
[14:54.330 --> 14:55.950]  Oh, my God.
[14:55.970 --> 14:58.570]  Gavin, thank you for sharing that on the last one.
[14:59.670 --> 15:01.350]  That is so freaking crazy.
[15:04.690 --> 15:08.090]  I should have said, Gracie, look away before posting that.
[15:08.470 --> 15:09.010]  Oh, my God.
[15:09.150 --> 15:10.510]  Gracie, you've had to see.
[15:10.510 --> 15:12.870]  You've had to see way too much of me.
[15:12.970 --> 15:14.170]  I deeply apologize.
[15:15.030 --> 15:16.110]  Oh, thank you.
[15:16.570 --> 15:18.190]  You know, that actually, thank you, Gavin.
[15:18.270 --> 15:18.890]  That's a great point.
[15:19.290 --> 15:21.750]  When you guys, I don't know if you've come to terms with this.
[15:22.110 --> 15:24.570]  You guys are going to need to wax your assholes again.
[15:24.690 --> 15:25.490]  And it's your fault.
[15:25.670 --> 15:27.050]  Oh, for God's sake.
[15:27.070 --> 15:30.850]  When we were doing that, I pitched that we should make the thing green
[15:30.850 --> 15:33.970]  so we could just put whatever we wanted as the backdrop.
[15:34.370 --> 15:38.390]  But no, you had to have the name of the show on it,
[15:38.410 --> 15:40.090]  which is no longer our show.
[15:40.090 --> 15:42.330]  We can't use those inserts anymore.
[15:42.590 --> 15:44.230]  We're going to need new inserts.
[15:44.810 --> 15:45.510]  Yeah, we'll do it again.
[15:45.910 --> 15:49.370]  As long as my good friends Nick and Eric will join me in the act,
[15:49.650 --> 15:50.850]  I'll do it again. Absolutely.
[15:51.310 --> 15:52.490]  No. What do you mean? No.
[15:53.050 --> 15:54.730]  What do you mean you want us to do?
[15:54.790 --> 15:55.610]  I'm not going to do that.
[15:55.730 --> 15:56.430]  You guys are going to do it.
[15:56.730 --> 15:57.710]  We're going to do it twice.
[15:57.990 --> 15:59.030]  All you have to do it is once.
[15:59.210 --> 16:00.150]  Nick's going to do it. Yeah.
[16:00.170 --> 16:01.230]  It's a stand up guy.
[16:01.370 --> 16:03.190]  I'm going to do it zero times.
[16:03.570 --> 16:04.450]  Nick's going to do it once.
[16:04.910 --> 16:05.750]  Nick's in on this.
[16:05.850 --> 16:06.850]  Don't don't listen to Eric.
[16:07.170 --> 16:08.510]  You have to lay down to do it.
[16:08.690 --> 16:09.810]  And I'm a stand up guy.
[16:09.810 --> 16:11.270]  Are you not working on the next thing, Eric?
[16:11.370 --> 16:12.770]  I'm definitely working on the next thing.
[16:12.830 --> 16:14.030]  I'm not doing this for it.
[16:14.450 --> 16:15.930]  Huh? Well, I bet he is.
[16:16.750 --> 16:18.610]  Hey, it's it's it's all a negotiation.
[16:18.870 --> 16:19.470]  We'll figure it out.
[16:19.710 --> 16:20.630]  We got nothing but time.
[16:21.170 --> 16:21.910]  Everyone has a price.
[16:22.330 --> 16:23.450]  That's right. Everybody does.
[16:23.670 --> 16:27.870]  It brought me so much joy realizing that you get we can't use those anymore.
[16:28.870 --> 16:30.310]  And we'll have to do it again.
[16:30.750 --> 16:32.730]  I'm just hearing about this and thinking about it
[16:32.730 --> 16:35.210]  for the first time in this moment, and it's it's kind of funny.
[16:36.470 --> 16:38.090]  You know, I've just realized.
[16:38.090 --> 16:42.070]  What? This is the last recording where Eric's my boss.
[16:43.190 --> 16:44.210]  Oh, it's true.
[16:44.330 --> 16:46.710]  Right now, I am Gavin's boss, technically. Yes.
[16:46.830 --> 16:47.890]  All right. Should we do my review?
[16:48.610 --> 16:49.590]  Yeah. You want to do your review?
[16:49.710 --> 16:51.090]  This is what I had planned for it.
[16:51.350 --> 16:55.790]  OK, so I wanted to go out before the company shut down and everything.
[16:56.490 --> 17:00.330]  I wanted to take Gavin out to dinner and then do his formal review
[17:01.170 --> 17:02.810]  and just sort of talk about.
[17:03.050 --> 17:03.930]  So this is how I would go.
[17:04.030 --> 17:07.350]  Gavin, thanks for joining me.
[17:07.350 --> 17:08.950]  This has been great.
[17:09.190 --> 17:11.590]  I really respect our working relationship and everything.
[17:11.810 --> 17:12.830]  How have you been feeling?
[17:13.050 --> 17:15.230]  Let's let's pretend like the company isn't going under or whatever.
[17:15.390 --> 17:17.210]  This is a situation where we're at.
[17:17.470 --> 17:20.530]  How are you feeling with, you know, how things are going,
[17:20.710 --> 17:23.150]  where you're at and where you want to be right now?
[17:23.570 --> 17:26.210]  Phenomenal. I think the podcast has there's no end in sight.
[17:26.550 --> 17:27.810]  I think we could just keep doing this.
[17:28.870 --> 17:30.050]  It's fun every week.
[17:31.170 --> 17:33.410]  And I don't see it going away anytime soon.
[17:33.910 --> 17:35.490]  Oh, that's fantastic. That's so good to hear.
[17:35.490 --> 17:37.310]  I'm really glad because I think your contribution.
[17:37.430 --> 17:39.250]  Oh, thank you so much. That's me getting a steak.
[17:39.330 --> 17:42.350]  We ordered steaks and they just said, oh, what kind of cut did you get?
[17:43.490 --> 17:47.870]  I got the perfect 10, which is just like a big like cowboy style steak.
[17:48.010 --> 17:52.590]  And it's just it's like I got it's like they put butter on it.
[17:52.650 --> 17:54.870]  It's like a compote. I'm I'm fucking stoked.
[17:55.990 --> 17:58.330]  Thank you so much, Gavin. I'm so glad.
[17:58.670 --> 17:59.650]  Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. One sec. One sec.
[18:00.230 --> 18:02.190]  Sorry. I ordered the the peppercorn sauce.
[18:04.710 --> 18:05.750]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
[18:05.990 --> 18:09.570]  Good call that I'm glad you got what you wanted.
[18:09.650 --> 18:11.170]  And that's what I'm hoping to provide you here.
[18:11.230 --> 18:12.450]  I always forget the sauce here.
[18:12.710 --> 18:13.750]  It's crazy. It's great.
[18:13.810 --> 18:17.470]  But, you know, it's, you know, service what you get what you pay for, right?
[18:19.130 --> 18:22.910]  So just sort of looking at where we're at, our reach and what we're doing
[18:23.710 --> 18:26.790]  just over the last year and going into this year.
[18:26.910 --> 18:28.930]  What I want to say is, please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:29.050 --> 18:30.130]  Please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:30.130 --> 18:31.510]  Can you stay? Please stay.
[18:31.690 --> 18:33.350]  Please stay. Please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:33.450 --> 18:34.790]  You're our only hope. Can you please stay?
[18:35.110 --> 18:37.210]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[18:38.010 --> 18:39.170]  Is that going to work for you?
[18:39.530 --> 18:43.930]  Hey, that's every that's every performance review I ever gave for 21 years.
[18:45.350 --> 18:49.570]  And it did sound like that because I learned I learned from the best.
[18:49.670 --> 18:53.550]  I think, Geoff, over the eight or nine years I worked under you,
[18:53.610 --> 18:55.670]  we only had one performance review.
[18:55.790 --> 18:57.170]  And then afterwards, you were like, I was done.
[18:57.330 --> 18:57.770]  Why did we do that?
[18:59.310 --> 19:00.970]  Every day was a performance review.
[19:01.310 --> 19:03.710]  Are you are you my boss as well, Eric? Technically?
[19:03.890 --> 19:05.310]  No, I think. No, no.
[19:05.370 --> 19:06.650]  Who's my boss then?
[19:07.050 --> 19:08.090]  Sarah, technically.
[19:08.730 --> 19:10.630]  But I only do that.
[19:10.750 --> 19:12.570]  You're also you're also a contractor.
[19:12.670 --> 19:14.310]  Also, Gracie in the chat just said me.
[19:14.390 --> 19:15.510]  So Gracie's your boss.
[19:15.870 --> 19:17.230]  Hey, Tracy's my boss.
[19:17.730 --> 19:19.930]  How do you do these last three years?
[19:20.430 --> 19:23.490]  Oh, my God. Oh, you got a happy face.
[19:24.010 --> 19:25.310]  Big happy face. I like that.
[19:25.710 --> 19:26.930]  Yeah, that's how I did.
[19:27.490 --> 19:30.550]  That's great. Because, you know, I've I've been here three years, so.
[19:30.870 --> 19:32.010]  Oh, definitely. Yeah.
[19:32.750 --> 19:33.790]  Excellent work. For sure.
[19:34.550 --> 19:37.090]  Thanks. Well, I didn't I wish I knew.
[19:38.730 --> 19:41.450]  I genuinely don't know who I'm supposed to report to.
[19:41.470 --> 19:42.230]  I thought it was you, Eric.
[19:42.370 --> 19:43.590]  I don't know what I mean.
[19:43.630 --> 19:44.950]  What reporting are you doing?
[19:45.490 --> 19:47.110]  I don't I don't know.
[19:47.270 --> 19:49.450]  Whatever reporting he was doing, he wasn't doing it, apparently.
[19:49.590 --> 19:53.310]  I feel like I should report to someone and I never know who to report.
[19:53.310 --> 19:56.830]  I really. Well, I think we all we all get to report to the unemployment line
[19:56.830 --> 19:58.090]  tomorrow, right? That's true.
[19:59.770 --> 20:01.370]  I think I'm going to still get paid.
[20:01.470 --> 20:05.050]  I feel like my trajectory with Rooster Teeth is Milton from office space
[20:05.050 --> 20:08.290]  and that I'm I have been in the basement the whole time.
[20:08.450 --> 20:11.090]  And I just I'm here, but nobody realizes.
[20:11.370 --> 20:12.250]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[20:12.710 --> 20:14.270]  And then you burn the place down. Yeah.
[20:14.590 --> 20:16.690]  Well, that's I wanted to have a performance review.
[20:16.730 --> 20:17.270]  That's too bad.
[20:18.170 --> 20:19.690]  I guess I could have a Gracie.
[20:20.110 --> 20:23.090]  I'm trying to think if I ever reported anything to Eric. Hmm.
[20:23.310 --> 20:25.630]  I think so. Reported, reported what?
[20:26.270 --> 20:26.910]  That's what I'm saying.
[20:28.170 --> 20:29.550]  Are you my boss, Eric?
[20:30.090 --> 20:35.550]  No. The only people that I was going to be in charge of was you.
[20:35.770 --> 20:38.110]  And they're like, and Gus.
[20:38.210 --> 20:40.310]  And I went, that doesn't make any sense.
[20:40.330 --> 20:41.730]  And they went, OK, yeah, not Gus.
[20:43.210 --> 20:44.150]  In what world?
[20:44.510 --> 20:47.850]  It was just people that it felt like no one else wanted to, like,
[20:48.290 --> 20:49.970]  have to deal with. Yeah.
[20:50.390 --> 20:51.730]  Well, no timeout for a second.
[20:51.730 --> 20:55.510]  I didn't start doing Let's Play until October is when we did that.
[20:55.890 --> 20:57.390]  Who is my boss before that?
[20:57.770 --> 20:58.630]  Did I have one?
[20:59.470 --> 21:00.690]  No, I mean, it was probably it.
[21:00.950 --> 21:02.170]  Yeah, it was probably Sarah or Steph.
[21:02.910 --> 21:06.650]  Yeah. Also, you keep saying boss like you're you're a contractor.
[21:07.270 --> 21:11.430]  Yeah. We just pay you for we just pay you for services rendered, bud.
[21:11.610 --> 21:13.110]  I don't know how any of this works.
[21:13.390 --> 21:15.590]  I I. Hey, clearly.
[21:17.270 --> 21:20.330]  Well, now now, Andrew, you're a partner.
[21:20.330 --> 21:22.410]  Hell, yeah. Whatever that means.
[21:22.790 --> 21:24.550]  Did you get reimbursed for the bog?
[21:25.130 --> 21:25.790]  What bog?
[21:26.610 --> 21:27.790]  The ping pong that you bought?
[21:28.050 --> 21:29.370]  No, I never. No, I never.
[21:29.670 --> 21:31.530]  No, I never assumed I would.
[21:32.090 --> 21:32.750]  Why would I?
[21:33.390 --> 21:34.110]  It's for the company.
[21:34.510 --> 21:35.730]  We got to secure that thing soon.
[21:36.410 --> 21:40.130]  You do. And if we don't, we need to put an air tag in it just to see where it goes.
[21:41.030 --> 21:43.150]  No, I think we still need it for stuff.
[21:43.430 --> 21:44.670]  So I would like to have it.
[21:44.690 --> 21:48.490]  I'm just saying if that's not a reality, we at least need an air tag on it.
[21:49.390 --> 21:52.990]  We just kept saying, I think, three times that we're going to get it
[21:52.990 --> 21:53.990]  and we're going to take it.
[21:54.070 --> 21:56.610]  And you kept going, well, put an air tag in it.
[21:56.730 --> 21:58.550]  I don't know why we we will have it.
[21:58.790 --> 21:59.390]  We will get it.
[21:59.470 --> 22:01.530]  Well, I don't. It's huge. It's big.
[22:01.610 --> 22:03.290]  I don't know where we're going to store it.
[22:03.510 --> 22:05.810]  Geoff didn't have room for me to send him waffle makers.
[22:05.910 --> 22:08.010]  All of a sudden, he's going to have a fucking port-a-potty.
[22:08.170 --> 22:09.710]  We've already secured a location.
[22:09.710 --> 22:11.830]  You understand Geoff's situation.
[22:12.510 --> 22:14.190]  Like, what are you talking about?
[22:14.850 --> 22:16.110]  I don't. What are you talking about?
[22:16.110 --> 22:17.690]  Oh, my God.
[22:18.270 --> 22:22.330]  I'm talking about Geoff and his inability to have a port-a-potty.
[22:23.410 --> 22:25.850]  I will. First off, I already had the port-a-potty here.
[22:26.390 --> 22:27.770]  We've almost sold it.
[22:28.090 --> 22:29.010]  We've secured it.
[22:29.030 --> 22:32.110]  No, I refused. I almost refused to accept it.
[22:34.190 --> 22:36.010]  We've for two fucking weeks.
[22:36.090 --> 22:36.710]  I dodged that guy.
[22:37.710 --> 22:40.110]  We've we've secured a location for it.
[22:40.110 --> 22:41.670]  We've got a place to keep it safe and sound.
[22:41.710 --> 22:43.330]  OK, we're good. Is it what we talked about?
[22:43.570 --> 22:45.170]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[22:45.170 --> 22:46.870]  Well, why don't I know?
[22:47.010 --> 22:49.110]  Why don't I know that?
[22:49.290 --> 22:53.430]  I feel like if anyone should know, I got to be honest with you.
[22:53.590 --> 22:57.130]  You probably do know you were probably in the conversation,
[22:57.290 --> 22:58.730]  but you were fucking around and not paying attention.
[22:59.350 --> 23:00.210]  I absolutely know.
[23:00.350 --> 23:01.930]  I listen. I lock in when it's serious.
[23:02.010 --> 23:04.590]  When it's business stuff, port-a-potty stuff.
[23:05.210 --> 23:06.390]  Don't I lock in right now?
[23:06.930 --> 23:08.450]  I'm locked in right now. Yeah.
[23:10.110 --> 23:14.530]  Less of a lock than I would be for a serious work thing, but I'm locked.
[23:14.530 --> 23:18.390]  OK. I'm like a lock that you could kick through.
[23:18.670 --> 23:20.150]  I'm not like the most secure.
[23:20.290 --> 23:24.550]  I'm not a vault when I'm in work mode, like serious work mode.
[23:24.610 --> 23:27.030]  I'm a vault. This is like a padlock.
[23:27.670 --> 23:29.370]  OK. I'm padlocked in.
[23:29.870 --> 23:32.630]  Oh, dear. I've just I've realized that the picture I sent
[23:32.630 --> 23:35.390]  is the least vaginery of three pictures.
[23:36.310 --> 23:39.310]  There's no way that's impossible.
[23:39.670 --> 23:41.370]  Unless you like spread the lip.
[23:41.430 --> 23:42.630]  I don't know what you're doing, bud.
[23:42.630 --> 23:44.710]  Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[23:44.950 --> 23:46.310]  Oh, my God. Gracie, look away.
[23:46.790 --> 23:48.530]  You know, there's more.
[23:48.950 --> 23:50.750]  That one. Oh, Jesus.
[23:51.670 --> 23:52.870]  Oh, God.
[23:53.510 --> 23:55.390]  Oh, that's way worse.
[23:55.510 --> 23:56.490]  Crazy. Don't look.
[23:56.810 --> 23:59.690]  Fuck. Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[24:00.070 --> 24:01.590]  We can't post this.
[24:01.930 --> 24:04.190]  We cannot. These have to stay here.
[24:04.750 --> 24:06.270]  These have to stay here.
[24:06.590 --> 24:08.630]  This is an extra life I got bruised.
[24:08.790 --> 24:11.710]  Yeah, but can I take a picture of my underwear on?
[24:11.710 --> 24:12.890]  I'm wearing it.
[24:12.910 --> 24:14.730]  He is where you can see his underwear.
[24:15.110 --> 24:15.890]  He is wearing it.
[24:15.990 --> 24:18.210]  It's just right next to his vaginal lips.
[24:18.830 --> 24:23.070]  I just covered my underwear with my vagina.
[24:23.370 --> 24:24.930]  It made it so much worse.
[24:25.150 --> 24:26.830]  It looks like a frotchless panties.
[24:27.390 --> 24:28.350]  Oh, my.
[24:28.810 --> 24:30.690]  I don't know how I did that.
[24:30.710 --> 24:32.290]  That was so unintentional.
[24:32.350 --> 24:33.590]  Hey, Gav. Yeah.
[24:33.850 --> 24:34.550]  You got plans tonight?
[24:38.070 --> 24:39.630]  Now I get my review from Geoff.
[24:42.310 --> 24:43.190]  Oh, God.
[24:43.310 --> 24:45.610]  This is Geoff giving a photo review.
[24:46.230 --> 24:48.470]  Also, it didn't sound like Gracie looked away.
[24:49.070 --> 24:50.130]  I don't think so.
[24:50.530 --> 24:52.370]  Great. I think Gracie was locked in.
[24:53.050 --> 24:54.270]  Gracie was real locked in.
[24:54.290 --> 24:55.390]  Oh, yeah. She sounded vaulted.
[24:55.610 --> 24:56.930]  That was a definite vaulted in.
[24:57.510 --> 24:59.470]  Yeah. Full eyes on screen.
[25:00.310 --> 25:01.510]  Sorry. We'll lose.
[25:02.290 --> 25:05.250]  Does anybody else have any housekeeping or anything else they want?
[25:05.290 --> 25:08.590]  I have another thing I was going to go through as well,
[25:08.630 --> 25:09.990]  like loose ends kind of thing.
[25:09.990 --> 25:12.250]  But I want to give anybody else the opportunity to.
[25:12.830 --> 25:17.530]  I never I never figured out bog roll folders, which is unfortunate.
[25:17.710 --> 25:18.650]  I'll keep thinking about that.
[25:18.690 --> 25:20.050]  But that's that's one of the few things.
[25:20.270 --> 25:22.030]  OK. Yeah, no, I don't really have any.
[25:22.530 --> 25:24.030]  So we all keep notes files, right?
[25:24.110 --> 25:26.730]  Gavin, I've seen yours. It's it's ridiculously long.
[25:27.650 --> 25:29.870]  I have a big long notes file, too.
[25:30.250 --> 25:34.650]  And I thought, like, because we're going to flip over to do the new thing,
[25:34.770 --> 25:37.370]  maybe it'd be good to turn over a new leaf, have a fresh start.
[25:37.770 --> 25:40.690]  And so I was thinking, I'm just going to get rid of those notes
[25:40.690 --> 25:42.150]  and just start a new, fresh file.
[25:42.310 --> 25:44.750]  And all the everything new we'll talk about will be new ideas
[25:44.750 --> 25:48.630]  and new new thoughts and just flush out that old stuff
[25:48.630 --> 25:49.670]  because we never got to it.
[25:49.750 --> 25:51.730]  It was obviously never important enough to make it into an episode.
[25:51.910 --> 25:53.790]  So why hang on to it, right?
[25:54.170 --> 25:56.610]  But I thought I'd go back and look through all of my old notes
[25:56.610 --> 25:57.510]  that we never talked about
[25:57.510 --> 25:59.290]  and just see if there was one or two or three things
[25:59.290 --> 26:00.830]  that might be fun to discuss.
[26:01.110 --> 26:04.570]  So I pulled out four things that I either never talked about
[26:04.570 --> 26:07.350]  or only began to talk about, but never really followed up on.
[26:07.790 --> 26:09.770]  And I'm just going to say them all now.
[26:09.790 --> 26:12.810]  And then instead of taking them one by one and giving each one space,
[26:12.810 --> 26:14.810]  I thought maybe we could I'd throw them all out there.
[26:14.850 --> 26:18.110]  And then if any of them are interesting, then we can explore it.
[26:18.370 --> 26:20.450]  Does that make sense? Yes. OK.
[26:21.350 --> 26:26.150]  First one was, do you think you've eaten more pizza or hamburgers in your life?
[26:27.230 --> 26:30.250]  And in addition to that, what is the thing you think you've eaten
[26:30.250 --> 26:31.830]  the most of in your life?
[26:31.830 --> 26:34.490]  And what do you think is more popular globally, pizza or hamburgers?
[26:34.570 --> 26:39.450]  The next one idea I had was I think that it would be a good idea.
[26:39.830 --> 26:40.970]  Do we tackle that?
[26:41.190 --> 26:43.170]  Let's talk about that. The first one first.
[26:43.330 --> 26:45.210]  You want to see you want to take them one by one then.
[26:45.310 --> 26:46.850]  OK, so definitely pizza.
[26:47.010 --> 26:48.390]  OK, definitely more pizza.
[26:49.170 --> 26:51.750]  Yeah. Yeah. Pizza has been consumed more.
[26:52.310 --> 26:54.630]  The thing I've eaten the most of undeniably is chicken,
[26:55.450 --> 26:59.070]  specifically like chicken nuggets or strips devoured.
[26:59.130 --> 27:01.790]  Mine would be mine would be penne pasta.
[27:01.790 --> 27:03.170]  Oh, penne.
[27:04.210 --> 27:05.850]  Penne. What do you say? Penne?
[27:06.330 --> 27:07.510]  Penne. Yeah.
[27:08.030 --> 27:13.690]  Penne. I I think mine might be hamburgers to both.
[27:14.650 --> 27:16.130]  Really? Yeah. Yeah.
[27:16.170 --> 27:19.150]  I think I've eaten peanut butter the most, probably.
[27:19.250 --> 27:20.270]  Oh, Nixon. Geez.
[27:20.450 --> 27:22.990]  By weight, more peanut butter than anything else.
[27:23.570 --> 27:26.130]  Yeah, maybe. Peanut butter is dense.
[27:26.870 --> 27:27.990]  It's it's very dense.
[27:27.990 --> 27:32.330]  And like, I'm just saying, not most, not not in my adult life, like
[27:32.330 --> 27:36.250]  in my adult, like in my adult life, not eating peanut butter
[27:36.250 --> 27:38.530]  super on the regular as a kid.
[27:39.310 --> 27:41.850]  Full like full peanut butter meals, dude.
[27:41.950 --> 27:45.530]  Like you have a peanut butter was would never be more than like 50 percent.
[27:45.670 --> 27:47.250]  No, no, no, no, no, no. No, you're wrong.
[27:47.730 --> 27:48.850]  Yeah, I don't agree with that.
[27:48.910 --> 27:52.150]  What you've never just shoved the screen in a jar of peanut butter.
[27:52.190 --> 27:53.670]  Yeah, I've done that a lot.
[27:53.910 --> 27:55.530]  Absolutely. Still, still do that.
[27:55.530 --> 27:56.890]  Yeah, like going insane.
[27:57.070 --> 27:58.850]  There's more apple than peanut butter, though.
[27:59.350 --> 28:00.870]  No, no, no, no, no.
[28:00.910 --> 28:01.650]  No, you're eating it wrong.
[28:01.830 --> 28:03.230]  Yeah, you're eating it all fucked up.
[28:03.430 --> 28:07.250]  So you have a slice of apple and then you scoop more than that.
[28:07.350 --> 28:09.290]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[28:09.550 --> 28:10.050]  Yeah. What?
[28:10.290 --> 28:16.430]  One slice of apple probably equals two slice size of peanut butter.
[28:16.550 --> 28:17.130]  Well, it's all said and done.
[28:17.170 --> 28:19.750]  How does the maths of that even work out?
[28:20.590 --> 28:23.710]  Because you take a bite, you scoop the peanut butter,
[28:23.710 --> 28:27.290]  you scoop the peanut butter with the apple slice and it's a lot.
[28:27.630 --> 28:30.650]  And you take a bite of that and then you have half an apple slice
[28:30.650 --> 28:33.330]  and then you do it one more time with that apple slice.
[28:33.470 --> 28:34.910]  So you like for sure.
[28:35.070 --> 28:37.610]  Yeah. No, you flip the apple slice around the other way.
[28:37.690 --> 28:40.070]  Yeah. Or it's your fucking house.
[28:40.190 --> 28:41.250]  Double dip if you want to.
[28:41.330 --> 28:43.750]  That is true. Also, also, I'm eight years old.
[28:43.790 --> 28:45.490]  So God's dead. None of it matters.
[28:45.490 --> 28:46.990]  Like I'm just going for it.
[28:48.230 --> 28:50.790]  Yeah, I think I think it's probably peanut butter for me.
[28:50.830 --> 28:52.330]  Number one. There's no way.
[28:53.030 --> 28:57.430]  So like for me, my entire life, I feel like when I think lunch,
[28:57.530 --> 28:59.650]  I think, oh, what hamburger am I going to eat today?
[29:01.150 --> 29:02.870]  Really? Yeah, sandwiches.
[29:03.150 --> 29:04.790]  It's the first food I think of.
[29:05.250 --> 29:07.570]  Yeah. Peanut butter. It's not my favorite or anything.
[29:07.570 --> 29:09.830]  But like if I'm just thinking like, oh, I'm getting a little hungry.
[29:10.310 --> 29:13.270]  Do I do I want to eat a Billy's today or do I want to go to the pool burger?
[29:13.590 --> 29:16.670]  Yeah. But if you're talking just like what's around the house,
[29:16.670 --> 29:18.850]  I feel like you always can make a sandwich.
[29:18.910 --> 29:20.390]  You can't always make a hamburger.
[29:21.110 --> 29:22.550]  Oh, you don't know what's in my fridge.
[29:23.190 --> 29:25.470]  If I I'm always ready for burger time.
[29:26.130 --> 29:27.750]  So you could make a burger right now.
[29:27.970 --> 29:29.630]  I could. Yeah, absolutely.
[29:30.910 --> 29:34.770]  Hmm. Could all how many of us could make a burger right now if we wanted to?
[29:34.870 --> 29:37.470]  I could. I could. I absolutely could.
[29:39.110 --> 29:40.430]  Everybody is fantastic.
[29:41.130 --> 29:42.190]  Well, everyone except me.
[29:42.470 --> 29:43.510]  I mean, you don't count.
[29:43.950 --> 29:48.310]  OK, if I make a bacon, I can make a bacon and jalapeno cheeseburger right now.
[29:48.310 --> 29:50.950]  Oh, yeah, I wanted to.
[29:51.070 --> 29:52.350]  I never had peanut butter on a burger.
[29:52.510 --> 29:54.010]  I feel like that's a trendy thing.
[29:54.650 --> 29:56.610]  No, never heard it. Yes, I have.
[29:57.030 --> 29:58.070]  Is it good? Is it good?
[29:58.390 --> 29:59.550]  It's fine. It's OK.
[30:00.230 --> 30:01.230]  Yeah, it's whatever.
[30:01.990 --> 30:05.090]  OK, so so everybody seems to think they've eaten more pizza in their life
[30:05.090 --> 30:06.290]  than hamburgers. That's cool.
[30:06.710 --> 30:08.310]  That's interesting. I'm hamburgers over pizza.
[30:08.570 --> 30:09.670]  Oh, right. You were hamburger.
[30:09.750 --> 30:12.130]  I think I'm probably hamburgers as well. Definitely hamburgers as well.
[30:12.810 --> 30:17.650]  The second thing I had is I think it's a we should investigate someday.
[30:17.650 --> 30:20.810]  You know how like Michelin got started and now it's just the tire company.
[30:20.810 --> 30:22.190]  But now they're like the Michelin.
[30:22.330 --> 30:24.630]  They issue the stars and they're like
[30:26.190 --> 30:28.710]  the subject matter experts on food. Right.
[30:29.290 --> 30:32.070]  Yeah. But they just started as a tire company. Right.
[30:32.110 --> 30:35.190]  Or like Guinness is a beer company that also does the world records.
[30:36.750 --> 30:38.910]  Why don't we create shit?
[30:39.450 --> 30:41.370]  Here's everything. OK, I know.
[30:41.410 --> 30:42.750]  I just never put that together.
[30:42.890 --> 30:44.430]  That's crazy. Yeah.
[30:44.430 --> 30:46.350]  I never thought about it.
[30:46.830 --> 30:51.350]  Wow. People were like arguing over over Guinness all the time about shit.
[30:51.430 --> 30:54.470]  And so they just decided to create the book that settles all the arguments.
[30:55.690 --> 30:58.990]  We should create a national hot dog registry
[30:59.590 --> 31:04.650]  where all the best hot dogs that are made in North America are listed.
[31:05.410 --> 31:08.070]  And you can and then so if you go to a strange town,
[31:08.170 --> 31:11.470]  you can pull up the registry and go, oh, I know there's three good hot dogs
[31:11.470 --> 31:12.950]  within eight miles of me.
[31:13.970 --> 31:18.730]  So it would be like that Moriarty app for escape rooms, but just for hot dogs.
[31:18.830 --> 31:19.870]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[31:20.050 --> 31:22.810]  And then maybe at some point, if we develop a little bit of cachet,
[31:22.870 --> 31:26.490]  it becomes like a Michelin for hot dogs and you get your you get your
[31:27.090 --> 31:30.210]  your hot dog, like three regulation rated or whatever.
[31:30.210 --> 31:31.530]  And then it's like it's a big deal.
[31:32.910 --> 31:33.950]  We could have an awards ceremony.
[31:35.270 --> 31:36.130]  I love it. Yeah.
[31:36.730 --> 31:37.390]  Something to think about.
[31:37.550 --> 31:39.030]  Is that going to be a uniform thing?
[31:40.130 --> 31:41.450]  Uniform or regulation thing?
[31:41.530 --> 31:42.510]  Yeah, I think probably.
[31:42.510 --> 31:44.010]  You just kind of like it like a regulation.
[31:44.190 --> 31:45.650]  Yeah, I think that's not a bad idea.
[31:45.930 --> 31:48.110]  The the next thing I had, we're almost done.
[31:48.150 --> 31:48.650]  I only have two more.
[31:49.030 --> 31:52.670]  The next thing is, do you guys think we should make toothpicks a thing again?
[31:54.370 --> 31:57.510]  Oh, I've been a big toothpick guy recently.
[31:58.250 --> 32:01.430]  I feel like I was way into toothpicks when I was a kid
[32:01.430 --> 32:03.090]  and I was watching Masters of the Air.
[32:03.470 --> 32:05.910]  And since they don't let anybody smoke cigarettes anymore,
[32:05.910 --> 32:08.710]  even in the past when people actually smoked cigarettes,
[32:08.750 --> 32:10.510]  they all just have like toothpicks in their mouths.
[32:10.990 --> 32:13.570]  And and I got me thinking toothpicks are pretty fucking cool,
[32:13.690 --> 32:16.210]  especially the flavored ones, like a cinnamon toothpick.
[32:16.490 --> 32:17.510]  Oh, it's pretty nice.
[32:17.610 --> 32:19.010]  You want to get into flavored toothpicks?
[32:19.310 --> 32:22.070]  Maybe like maybe we could contemporize toothpicks.
[32:22.570 --> 32:26.130]  Oh, maybe we should make our own flavors and saturate our toothpicks.
[32:26.170 --> 32:29.290]  And then we'll try them like a waffle bomb toothpick.
[32:29.710 --> 32:31.590]  Yeah. Oh, God.
[32:32.450 --> 32:36.050]  I feel like those little floss pick things have outdone them.
[32:37.050 --> 32:38.390]  Yeah, I think I think they're a fad.
[32:38.950 --> 32:40.650]  Yeah. Oh, I don't.
[32:40.790 --> 32:43.290]  I think those I think the flosser picks are here to stay.
[32:43.470 --> 32:47.690]  And now I know I associate I associate toothpicks with like
[32:48.250 --> 32:49.650]  long haul truckers.
[32:49.770 --> 32:50.650]  You know what I mean?
[32:50.750 --> 32:54.390]  Like like they're dipping them and like staying up.
[32:55.390 --> 32:57.210]  Here's our play. Here's our play.
[32:57.910 --> 33:00.830]  You can dip them to stay up. Easy. That's true.
[33:01.290 --> 33:05.650]  To those flossers you're talking about, they're plastic full of microplastics.
[33:05.970 --> 33:08.150]  Every time you use it, you're probably poisoning your mouth.
[33:08.630 --> 33:12.150]  You get down there in your nether regions and just filling it with microplastics.
[33:12.290 --> 33:13.850]  We need to return to wood.
[33:13.970 --> 33:16.370]  If you're going to put it in your mouth, it needs to be wood.
[33:17.690 --> 33:20.430]  I think Gracie has a great point, which is we need to bring back
[33:20.430 --> 33:21.910]  a piece of wheat in your mouth.
[33:22.430 --> 33:23.890]  We need to go back even further.
[33:24.230 --> 33:25.850]  That's good, too. That's good, too.
[33:26.050 --> 33:27.390]  This is where do you get wheat from?
[33:27.790 --> 33:28.550]  Is that Buckley?
[33:32.730 --> 33:34.150]  It looks just like him.
[33:40.510 --> 33:43.890]  OK, last thing I have and then I'm done and then I'm going to close the books
[33:43.890 --> 33:46.770]  on all my face ideas and delete the the file.
[33:47.950 --> 33:51.210]  I think, you know, as you guys know, I'm a big TikToker now.
[33:51.370 --> 33:52.950]  Now that the government doesn't like it, I like it.
[33:53.790 --> 33:56.150]  And so I've been watching a ton of TikTok.
[33:57.010 --> 34:00.690]  And I think that we I think that there's a market there because we're clever.
[34:00.850 --> 34:02.330]  We're clever people, right?
[34:02.670 --> 34:03.290]  We're very smart.
[34:03.750 --> 34:06.710]  What we make, we make games and ideas all think of all the games
[34:06.710 --> 34:08.750]  we made in Minecraft, Gavin, think of all that work we've done.
[34:08.790 --> 34:10.270]  Think of all the clever things we've invented.
[34:10.710 --> 34:15.310]  TikTok is a wash with made up sports that people are inventing themselves.
[34:15.450 --> 34:17.050]  There's the pool balls on the treadmill.
[34:17.570 --> 34:19.810]  There's the people that race marbles.
[34:20.030 --> 34:23.770]  They're the dudes that swing bottles at each other and see which one breaks.
[34:23.950 --> 34:29.970]  I feel like between the five of us, we could create the next great TikTok sport.
[34:32.690 --> 34:34.030]  I agree with that.
[34:34.030 --> 34:37.590]  I just an immediate thought that came from that statement is there's sort of
[34:37.590 --> 34:41.830]  this common vernacular of like street smarts versus school smarts.
[34:42.110 --> 34:45.590]  How would you categorize your Minecraft smarts that you're presenting?
[34:45.830 --> 34:47.790]  The ability to make game modes?
[34:48.130 --> 34:48.750]  Nerd smarts.
[34:48.750 --> 34:49.910]  What is nerd smarts?
[34:49.950 --> 34:51.690]  OK, yeah, actually like that. That was good.
[34:52.390 --> 34:55.830]  I feel like we should we should rent a steamroller, right?
[34:56.390 --> 34:58.250]  Mm hmm. So I've got so far.
[35:00.970 --> 35:02.650]  We should rent a steamroller
[35:02.650 --> 35:05.830]  and then try to flatten and then unflatten things.
[35:07.230 --> 35:09.930]  What's the difference between a steamroller and an iron?
[35:10.470 --> 35:11.290]  Is it just scale?
[35:11.830 --> 35:13.270]  Couple hundred thousand pounds.
[35:13.570 --> 35:14.730]  Yeah. What do you what do you mean?
[35:14.990 --> 35:17.550]  Do you want to get into like steamrolling your underwear?
[35:18.130 --> 35:21.010]  Well, no, I'm just I'm I don't really know what a steamroller does.
[35:21.150 --> 35:23.290]  Could you iron a shirt properly with a steamroller?
[35:23.450 --> 35:26.890]  Let's get an ironing board and a shirt and a steamroller
[35:26.890 --> 35:28.950]  and see if we get better results than an iron.
[35:28.950 --> 35:32.950]  Oh, well, it's it's functionally supposed to be the same, right?
[35:32.990 --> 35:34.050]  It's just like a larger version.
[35:34.410 --> 35:38.310]  Yeah, you could you could do your entire wardrobe in one roll.
[35:39.590 --> 35:41.930]  Let's get into really long ironing boards
[35:43.670 --> 35:46.850]  or or let's make a steamrolling iron.
[35:47.510 --> 35:50.190]  That's like a little mini steamroller that you can iron.
[35:50.950 --> 35:52.290]  Oh, we'll make it really heavy.
[35:52.370 --> 35:55.750]  We'll make it out of like tungsten, heated tungsten.
[35:55.750 --> 36:01.390]  Oh, God, let's make the most premium automated iron
[36:01.390 --> 36:03.370]  the world has ever seen.
[36:03.730 --> 36:06.410]  Oh, I think it's a great idea.
[36:06.930 --> 36:09.890]  And if it's remote control and we can drive it back and forth
[36:09.890 --> 36:12.590]  over the ironing boards, you don't have to use your own pressure.
[36:12.750 --> 36:13.470]  Oh, this is awesome.
[36:13.890 --> 36:16.530]  You went through a little phase of wanting to get into RC cars.
[36:16.710 --> 36:19.470]  Like still do this, still do combine in.
[36:19.870 --> 36:23.150]  Yeah, I'm by the way, that is that's on the that's on the back burner.
[36:23.250 --> 36:25.450]  But that's very much still the pin is still in it.
[36:25.450 --> 36:28.750]  It's just I don't think I remember, but we all lost our jobs.
[36:28.910 --> 36:30.050]  And then, yeah, it really
[36:30.050 --> 36:33.350]  kind of went out of the sails of the high end RC car idea.
[36:33.570 --> 36:37.570]  Yeah, those those $800 RC cars started looking a lot less interesting
[36:38.790 --> 36:39.950]  over the last month or so.
[36:40.250 --> 36:42.730]  But we'll get back there. We'll get back. Maybe.
[36:46.330 --> 36:48.990]  So who's in charge of all the money at the next thing?
[36:51.430 --> 36:54.110]  Not it. Not it. Not it.
[36:54.990 --> 36:57.790]  Oh, we're hiring a we're hiring a company.
[36:58.450 --> 37:03.470]  Oh, OK. Because because we say who's in charge of all the money,
[37:03.550 --> 37:06.670]  which makes me think that none of us should be in charge of all the money.
[37:06.790 --> 37:07.250]  What do you mean?
[37:08.770 --> 37:12.090]  Yeah, I mean, I was immediately thinking, how do I how do I spend
[37:12.090 --> 37:14.010]  forty five hundred dollars on a block of tungsten?
[37:14.530 --> 37:15.130]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:16.770 --> 37:20.990]  I didn't say not me because I felt I disqualified myself by asking
[37:20.990 --> 37:23.170]  what's the difference between an iron and a steamroller?
[37:23.170 --> 37:27.270]  I felt that made it clear that I'm not in the running for this race.
[37:27.370 --> 37:27.890]  That's OK.
[37:30.870 --> 37:31.870]  Oh, we're fucked.
[37:34.130 --> 37:35.430]  Yeah, we're going to try.
[37:37.810 --> 37:40.350]  I've got so many notes that I either don't understand
[37:40.350 --> 37:42.270]  or have no idea if I've ever brought up.
[37:42.770 --> 37:44.830]  I love it. Let's do it. Hit me with it.
[37:45.130 --> 37:46.990]  What is Andrew confused about bats?
[37:48.790 --> 37:51.430]  What is Andrew confused about bats?
[37:51.570 --> 37:52.930]  Did I text you about bats, maybe?
[37:53.990 --> 37:56.410]  Spit take thinking about alien pussy.
[37:56.630 --> 38:02.810]  What? Oh, was that from our was that from our our smut that we wrote?
[38:03.490 --> 38:05.770]  No, no. This is years ago, baby.
[38:06.630 --> 38:07.670]  Advert for milk.
[38:08.930 --> 38:09.810]  Quarantine pasta.
[38:11.030 --> 38:13.170]  Wasp fan. Yeah, I don't know.
[38:13.230 --> 38:14.470]  I don't know what any of this is.
[38:15.110 --> 38:18.210]  Wasp fan is when your fan got got the wasp nest in it.
[38:18.610 --> 38:19.730]  Yeah. Oh, natural fan.
[38:20.110 --> 38:21.710]  Not someone who is a fan of wasps.
[38:21.710 --> 38:22.750]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[38:23.130 --> 38:25.710]  Gavin's notes list is like playing fucking connections
[38:25.710 --> 38:26.770]  or you're trying to interpret.
[38:26.930 --> 38:28.390]  Is it literal? Is it a saying?
[38:28.710 --> 38:31.070]  What is the context in which this word is being used?
[38:31.290 --> 38:32.910]  Is it a word that means multiple things?
[38:33.970 --> 38:36.410]  An outlets off guy or not?
[38:36.750 --> 38:41.130]  A what? An outlets off guy or not?
[38:41.890 --> 38:43.410]  Turn the outlets off, maybe.
[38:44.230 --> 38:47.490]  Oh, does that mean that you like trip the breaker on the outlet
[38:47.490 --> 38:48.750]  so that it's not active?
[38:50.090 --> 38:51.730]  Why would I be that kind of guy, though?
[38:52.210 --> 38:53.670]  Would that reduce your power bill?
[38:53.890 --> 38:54.910]  Maybe your electric bill?
[38:56.550 --> 38:56.950]  Maybe.
[38:57.610 --> 38:58.770]  You turned off the...
[38:58.770 --> 39:00.870]  No, I can't be drawn any power.
[39:02.490 --> 39:03.250]  Well, it has to, right?
[39:03.330 --> 39:04.990]  Doesn't it always have to be technically?
[39:05.890 --> 39:07.370]  Yeah, but to be such a small amount.
[39:07.490 --> 39:07.950]  I don't know.
[39:08.490 --> 39:10.430]  Bag full of cocaine, nothing else.
[39:10.650 --> 39:14.350]  Oh, that was when I wanted to have a suitcase that was full of full
[39:14.350 --> 39:18.730]  to the brim of just cocaine powder to see if they could see it on the X-ray.
[39:22.090 --> 39:24.670]  Instead of it looking like a secret hidden compartment,
[39:24.850 --> 39:26.570]  it would just be entirely coke.
[39:27.970 --> 39:29.530]  I was wondering if I could get through.
[39:30.310 --> 39:32.230]  How much does an X-ray machine cost?
[39:37.050 --> 39:38.590]  You have to be able to buy those, right?
[39:38.690 --> 39:40.170]  I've never considered that, but.
[39:40.470 --> 39:43.890]  Well, the airports are getting rid of them all for those like CT scanners now.
[39:44.010 --> 39:46.850]  So there's probably a bunch of X-ray shit on the market.
[39:47.830 --> 39:49.010]  Let's see, airport scanner cost.
[39:49.090 --> 39:50.170]  I have a question for you, Gavin.
[39:50.170 --> 39:52.590]  Is wrapping up old, old things and.
[39:54.070 --> 39:57.150]  Face territory, a thing that I've pretended to not care about,
[39:57.170 --> 39:58.670]  but but still think about.
[39:59.630 --> 40:01.550]  Is it the time in Halo that I have better than you still?
[40:02.030 --> 40:04.610]  No, it's a Halo related thing, though.
[40:04.890 --> 40:06.470]  What was the word you made up?
[40:08.010 --> 40:10.450]  Do you remember what was the word?
[40:12.510 --> 40:15.730]  Oh, you told us what was made up.
[40:17.310 --> 40:18.570]  Word must have.
[40:18.570 --> 40:20.930]  We're playing Halo just to give context for this.
[40:21.110 --> 40:22.270]  And Gavin tried to.
[40:22.690 --> 40:23.970]  He said, you ever hear about?
[40:24.370 --> 40:25.410]  And then he said a word.
[40:25.530 --> 40:27.210]  And I was like, that's just made that up.
[40:27.270 --> 40:27.830]  That's fake.
[40:27.870 --> 40:29.010]  And he immediately folded.
[40:29.510 --> 40:31.230]  But then I forgot what it was called.
[40:31.870 --> 40:32.610]  And he refused.
[40:32.630 --> 40:33.490]  Yeah, and then I wrote it.
[40:33.790 --> 40:35.130]  I wrote it for everyone else, didn't I?
[40:35.130 --> 40:38.250]  I told her I took a picture of it or something, but I don't know how to find it.
[40:38.770 --> 40:39.450]  But I don't remember.
[40:39.790 --> 40:42.610]  And I pretended like I haven't cared when I have.
[40:42.690 --> 40:43.330]  So I thought.
[40:44.410 --> 40:46.590]  And he remembered what was the word?
[40:48.930 --> 40:50.350]  Jazz, I can't be jazz.
[40:50.710 --> 40:52.150]  That's Geoff's new favorite.
[40:53.170 --> 40:54.270]  Jizzle. NBA term.
[40:54.610 --> 40:54.970]  Yeah.
[40:55.970 --> 40:59.230]  Chisel, I've sent it in a text to Geoff and Eric, maybe.
[41:00.050 --> 41:02.050]  I think you sent a photo of it.
[41:02.930 --> 41:06.350]  If the end of this arc is you not knowing it and being unable to find it,
[41:06.370 --> 41:08.010]  I'm totally OK with that. That's great.
[41:08.230 --> 41:08.710]  I'm happy.
[41:09.890 --> 41:11.830]  What would it have begun with?
[41:12.130 --> 41:13.070]  Great question.
[41:13.210 --> 41:14.170]  I've been wondering the same.
[41:14.710 --> 41:16.970]  This is the word that we were saying, or this is the word that Gavin?
[41:16.970 --> 41:18.990]  No. Oh, I forgot about that.
[41:19.890 --> 41:20.930]  Wait, which one was that?
[41:21.450 --> 41:21.830]  Nothing.
[41:24.850 --> 41:27.410]  Nothing. I forgot about that.
[41:28.350 --> 41:29.970]  That's unrelated. Don't worry about that, Gavin.
[41:30.470 --> 41:31.490]  Is that something I should know about?
[41:31.950 --> 41:33.470]  No, just trying to find your word.
[41:33.890 --> 41:34.690]  Yeah. What's your word, Gavin?
[41:34.830 --> 41:36.690]  We've got we've got multiple words in the mix.
[41:38.070 --> 41:40.430]  I mean, not if you can't remember your word.
[41:43.170 --> 41:45.010]  Yeah, I guess it depends on you, doesn't it?
[41:45.610 --> 41:50.110]  I did see one subreddit thread about our word, and it made me very happy
[41:50.110 --> 41:52.450]  where they're just like, hey, he's really trying to make that a thing.
[41:53.450 --> 41:56.010]  Oh, I found my list of punch lines without
[41:57.170 --> 41:58.010]  without setups.
[41:58.350 --> 41:59.330]  That's my wife.
[42:00.030 --> 42:01.670]  That's not a goose. That's my wife.
[42:05.010 --> 42:06.350]  That's a newspaper with legs.
[42:07.750 --> 42:10.230]  One of my notes just says Alanis Morissette.
[42:10.310 --> 42:10.910]  What's that about?
[42:12.850 --> 42:13.990]  Was that feet related?
[42:15.490 --> 42:16.290]  I don't know.
[42:18.890 --> 42:20.350]  What year was that word?
[42:23.250 --> 42:25.290]  This is the best case scenario for me.
[42:25.350 --> 42:26.370]  I'm so happy I asked.
[42:29.090 --> 42:30.410]  I can't say, I don't know.
[42:32.070 --> 42:35.070]  I definitely made some guesses in our text chain, if you want to point a reference.
[42:36.350 --> 42:36.990]  What were the guesses?
[42:37.650 --> 42:38.810]  Well, you think I know?
[42:38.810 --> 42:39.630]  I don't even know the word.
[42:39.730 --> 42:41.130]  You think I know my guesses that were wrong?
[42:42.110 --> 42:44.430]  Fuck, do we know what's the chance?
[42:48.170 --> 42:49.970]  Well, all you think about that, I have a clip.
[42:50.450 --> 42:51.370]  Oh, my God.
[42:53.210 --> 42:55.690]  What was did you find it, Gavin, or was that a reaction by clip?
[42:56.070 --> 42:56.710]  That was your clip.
[42:57.930 --> 43:01.390]  It's not it's an unrelated Sea Thieves story,
[43:01.490 --> 43:04.950]  but it is a very funny clip that I would like to share.
[43:05.870 --> 43:10.410]  I was so Sea Thieves, you have an email where you can hide in a barrel.
[43:10.410 --> 43:13.230]  And so the goal is to sneak into somebody's ship
[43:13.230 --> 43:15.530]  and then barely emote and be sneaky.
[43:16.030 --> 43:17.130]  Barrel of bullshit.
[43:20.790 --> 43:25.870]  I snuck into a boat and I thought, I'm this is I'm so well placed.
[43:26.230 --> 43:28.530]  They will never know that I'm here.
[43:28.630 --> 43:29.650]  And here's a link to the clip.
[43:30.010 --> 43:31.510]  I don't think it shows it.
[43:32.370 --> 43:37.170]  Before that clip begins, one of them ran down into this area
[43:37.870 --> 43:39.490]  and then ran back upstairs.
[43:39.490 --> 43:40.910]  And I thought, I am in the clear.
[43:41.310 --> 43:42.270]  Let me know when you watch the clip.
[43:45.450 --> 43:46.330]  Oh, yeah, good.
[43:48.170 --> 43:49.310]  Yeah, it's a good spot.
[43:50.070 --> 43:52.610]  Yeah, so I'm like, oh, this is a great position I'm in.
[43:53.330 --> 43:54.850]  I'm like, I'm playing prop one.
[43:55.370 --> 43:57.050]  It is like I'm playing prop one.
[43:57.190 --> 43:58.830]  I'm like, it looks so natural.
[44:00.470 --> 44:00.930]  I really.
[44:02.030 --> 44:03.270]  I can't complain about this.
[44:03.330 --> 44:04.390]  I feel really secure.
[44:04.730 --> 44:08.310]  I'll just wait until they like selling stuff or looting later
[44:08.310 --> 44:11.750]  and then I'll pop out and I'll really get the upper hand on them.
[44:12.610 --> 44:13.530]  Show them a thing or two.
[44:14.750 --> 44:17.750]  And that is not what ended up happening at all.
[44:23.070 --> 44:28.070]  The guy, the guy ran past me once.
[44:29.230 --> 44:32.510]  And he clearly was like, oh, this idiot is right there.
[44:32.610 --> 44:35.350]  So then he went up and he got his entire crew
[44:35.350 --> 44:37.370]  and they all came down together.
[44:37.370 --> 44:39.090]  And he's like, this idiot.
[44:39.310 --> 44:40.910]  And then they blew me away.
[44:41.190 --> 44:43.690]  They all just melted with shotgun shots.
[44:44.130 --> 44:45.210]  That is terrifying.
[44:45.390 --> 44:46.450]  They all came.
[44:46.850 --> 44:47.550]  They all came.
[44:47.810 --> 44:49.490]  He's like, yeah, let's see this idiot.
[44:49.870 --> 44:51.950]  There had no chance.
[44:53.010 --> 44:54.310]  Anyway, see, this is great.
[44:54.530 --> 44:55.710]  I'm excited for us to play more of it.
[44:56.530 --> 44:57.270]  I don't have any other clips.
[44:57.350 --> 44:59.670]  I don't have any other past things.
[45:00.070 --> 45:01.110]  Gavin, did you figure out your work yet?
[45:01.930 --> 45:03.830]  No, I'm trying to look back through our texts.
[45:06.370 --> 45:07.690]  You know, we text so much.
[45:08.050 --> 45:09.310]  Yeah, that's so many.
[45:09.890 --> 45:11.490]  Well, we used to.
[45:11.730 --> 45:12.770]  Oh, that's like a dig.
[45:14.550 --> 45:17.330]  What was the what was the meaning of the word?
[45:17.390 --> 45:17.770]  Do you remember?
[45:18.670 --> 45:21.570]  No, I don't remember anything about it outside of
[45:22.950 --> 45:25.810]  it was a really obviously fake sounding thing.
[45:25.950 --> 45:27.310]  And then I forgot it.
[45:27.470 --> 45:29.070]  And then you refused to tell me.
[45:29.490 --> 45:30.850]  Fuck, let me look some more.
[45:31.490 --> 45:32.810]  Waste the last episode.
[45:33.150 --> 45:33.990]  Fucking searching.
[45:37.510 --> 45:39.470]  It's crazy to think that this is the end.
[45:39.630 --> 45:43.550]  Like, obviously, we've known for a long time, but not, you know, the end in the sense of
[45:44.230 --> 45:45.970]  this will be nothing to the audience.
[45:46.150 --> 45:49.310]  We're going to be on a different feed on Wednesday.
[45:49.470 --> 45:50.490]  Everything will be the same.
[45:51.170 --> 45:53.250]  I mean, it doesn't feel like a ton for us either.
[45:53.350 --> 45:54.330]  Like, we're just going to keep going.
[45:54.610 --> 45:54.930]  I don't know.
[45:54.950 --> 45:57.970]  It feels like an end to me, I think, because of the company more so closing
[45:57.970 --> 45:59.630]  than necessarily because this.
[46:00.330 --> 46:04.110]  Like all of all of the closest friendships
[46:04.110 --> 46:07.590]  I have are connected through the company, it's just it's crazy that that
[46:07.590 --> 46:09.250]  will cease to exist.
[46:09.990 --> 46:13.610]  It's weird to think that the thing that like meant so much to me
[46:14.110 --> 46:17.810]  that somebody who is my age when I found it just will not have that opportunity
[46:17.810 --> 46:19.130]  to find and have a similar journey.
[46:20.410 --> 46:24.730]  At least for that, I mean, we're building, we're building a new exciting thing.
[46:27.530 --> 46:32.010]  Um. Yeah, I was saying on the Rooster Teeth podcast that it really is.
[46:32.450 --> 46:35.530]  I don't know, because I've grown up doing this, really.
[46:35.850 --> 46:39.810]  But it is so amazing, such an amazing feeling to have a platform
[46:39.810 --> 46:41.290]  where you can make people laugh.
[46:41.430 --> 46:44.770]  Like when people say that they were like, they like spat out their drink.
[46:45.350 --> 46:46.630]  That's something I said.
[46:47.050 --> 46:48.790]  I just can't beat that feeling.
[46:48.890 --> 46:51.110]  I think that's the reason I don't ever want to stop doing this.
[46:52.430 --> 46:53.870]  It might be the best feeling in the world.
[46:55.210 --> 46:57.350]  It's really, yeah, it's an incredible feeling,
[46:58.010 --> 47:01.750]  especially to get to do with people you love making stuff with, like it's a double.
[47:01.990 --> 47:06.070]  It is so rewarding personally and touching to know that
[47:06.810 --> 47:09.570]  we have a platform in which allows us to connect with people
[47:09.570 --> 47:13.470]  and and bring laughter to their day, as well as just being able
[47:13.470 --> 47:18.430]  to bring laughter to people's days that I know and have a different relationship with.
[47:19.670 --> 47:22.430]  It's awesome. It's the best of both scenarios.
[47:23.870 --> 47:28.290]  I wrote a little thing to read as like a thank you to the audience
[47:28.290 --> 47:28.970]  and that type of thing.
[47:29.170 --> 47:32.410]  I decided to record it independently because it's like, I don't know.
[47:33.130 --> 47:35.850]  I'm an easy crier and I'm glad I did.
[47:36.010 --> 47:38.230]  Jesus Christ. Messy boy.
[47:39.050 --> 47:40.670]  Did you do multiple takes?
[47:41.210 --> 47:42.630]  OK, well, Jesus Christ.
[47:42.710 --> 47:44.110]  I felt like I was in a musical.
[47:44.790 --> 47:46.690]  You all just sound like a little baby.
[47:47.470 --> 47:50.630]  Just waiting for you to stop so we can all say our jokes.
[47:51.030 --> 47:52.350]  Yes, it was great.
[47:53.110 --> 47:54.470]  OK, Geoff, joke one.
[47:55.070 --> 47:57.250]  I don't even remember what I asked.
[47:57.550 --> 47:58.370]  Eric, joke two.
[47:59.170 --> 48:01.210]  Was it the potato thing you already recorded?
[48:01.430 --> 48:03.990]  No, no. Oh, did you cry like a baby?
[48:04.470 --> 48:05.430]  Was it embarrassing?
[48:05.870 --> 48:08.810]  Was it was it like sobbing or was it like dignified tears?
[48:09.310 --> 48:13.830]  It was, I think, a good medium between dignified tears and baby tears.
[48:14.750 --> 48:18.130]  But it's it's you know, that's not well, it's not hard to do with me.
[48:18.130 --> 48:23.470]  Let me just say, as someone who's never cried on camera in his life,
[48:24.310 --> 48:26.090]  I'm disgusted by you.
[48:26.850 --> 48:28.050]  You know, hop ups.
[48:28.610 --> 48:29.650]  What is a hop up, Nick?
[48:30.210 --> 48:33.150]  You know, when you're someone's crying so much, they're like,
[48:33.890 --> 48:36.590]  Oh, OK, yeah, no, no.
[48:36.950 --> 48:38.090]  Yeah, I didn't have that.
[48:38.530 --> 48:41.170]  I think the last time I had that was when I saw me, Earl, the dying girl.
[48:41.530 --> 48:45.110]  That one got me as well.
[48:45.630 --> 48:48.090]  I never saw that, but I guess she died.
[48:48.230 --> 48:48.710]  I guess she died.
[48:48.990 --> 48:50.090]  Well, yes, she dies.
[48:50.150 --> 48:51.650]  And I was it. It hit.
[48:51.850 --> 48:54.650]  It was just, you know, I don't know what it was, but that day it hit hard.
[48:55.150 --> 48:57.730]  And it's the hardest I think I've cried in a movie.
[48:58.110 --> 49:01.210]  And it was so bad that I had to start staring at the ceiling
[49:01.210 --> 49:03.930]  to, like, gather myself because I was like, this is insane.
[49:04.130 --> 49:05.690]  This is ridiculous. I'm crying.
[49:06.050 --> 49:08.250]  And I was like, OK, OK, I'm all good.
[49:08.310 --> 49:10.770]  And I brought my eyes back down and she was still dying.
[49:10.990 --> 49:13.090]  And I oh no. Oh, back to the roof.
[49:13.090 --> 49:16.470]  I can't. Is that what that that TV?
[49:16.610 --> 49:19.130]  I never watched it, but that My Name Is Earl show was about.
[49:19.210 --> 49:22.570]  He was apologizing to everybody because he killed that girl.
[49:23.130 --> 49:25.890]  It was like a mix between me, Earl and the dying girl and Dexter.
[49:26.130 --> 49:28.390]  He would kill a different person every week.
[49:29.730 --> 49:32.610]  And yeah, first season was great.
[49:33.290 --> 49:34.030]  John, let's go.
[49:34.770 --> 49:35.930]  You know, it's John, let's go.
[49:36.230 --> 49:37.710]  And that gal. Hmm.
[49:38.450 --> 49:41.570]  I saw him in an interview and he said, John, let's go.
[49:41.570 --> 49:42.810]  And I went, what the fuck?
[49:43.470 --> 49:45.150]  Do you cover that in your message to the audience?
[49:45.450 --> 49:48.790]  I do. Yeah, that's actually what I both open and close with.
[49:49.210 --> 49:51.470]  Are are we going to hear your message, too?
[49:51.570 --> 49:53.230]  Are you going to play it for us or is it a thing?
[49:53.410 --> 49:53.950]  I'm not going to play it.
[49:53.970 --> 49:57.890]  You know, I mean, we know and and then it'll tack on to the end of the episode.
[49:58.770 --> 50:02.110]  Kelly, who edits this show, does a wonderful job.
[50:02.450 --> 50:06.070]  So we don't get to hear it till the audience does. Yeah.
[50:06.890 --> 50:08.750]  This is Kelly's last edit, then, is it?
[50:09.030 --> 50:09.810]  It is. Yeah.
[50:09.810 --> 50:11.550]  Oh, that sucks.
[50:12.650 --> 50:13.570]  Shout out to Kelly.
[50:13.990 --> 50:15.530]  Shout out to Kelly. Shout out to Kelly.
[50:16.770 --> 50:18.730]  Dude, absolutely tremendous job.
[50:18.810 --> 50:21.030]  Every every fucking week, week in, week out.
[50:21.510 --> 50:22.210]  Amazing editor.
[50:22.350 --> 50:25.930]  And I think something that has added so much to our show that we've been lucky
[50:25.930 --> 50:29.930]  that so many of the people that have hands in it care about it and enjoy it.
[50:29.930 --> 50:33.670]  And I think that that when you have that, it shows in the work.
[50:34.090 --> 50:37.650]  And get it as well, you know, because humor is subjective.
[50:37.650 --> 50:39.890]  And if and one of the things that I've learned over the last,
[50:40.410 --> 50:45.370]  you know, however, 150 years of doing this is that an editor can absolutely make
[50:45.370 --> 50:46.430]  or break a production.
[50:47.410 --> 50:51.330]  And the fact that Kelly 100 percent gets what we're doing
[50:52.130 --> 50:55.810]  and then is able to enhance it with her talents and abilities is fucking amazing.
[50:56.590 --> 50:58.170]  Can I ask a completely unrelated question?
[50:58.710 --> 50:59.490]  Anything? Yeah.
[50:59.590 --> 51:00.650]  Do vitamins work?
[51:01.690 --> 51:03.250]  There's a lot of controversy over that.
[51:03.310 --> 51:04.210]  Are vitamins real?
[51:04.990 --> 51:07.290]  That a lot of people. No, I don't think so.
[51:08.250 --> 51:09.150]  Great. Really?
[51:09.710 --> 51:11.230]  Is that different to like a supplement?
[51:11.830 --> 51:13.890]  Yeah. No supplements as well.
[51:14.370 --> 51:15.490]  Gracie said, I've tried hundreds.
[51:15.570 --> 51:16.430]  What do you mean by that?
[51:16.730 --> 51:19.230]  Like I went through a really weird phase in college
[51:19.230 --> 51:21.790]  where like I really wanted to find a vitamin that worked.
[51:22.770 --> 51:24.590]  And so I bought me by worked.
[51:24.910 --> 51:27.170]  Yeah. Well, how would you track like this?
[51:27.230 --> 51:28.970]  You felt like in some way, for example.
[51:29.010 --> 51:32.270]  Yeah. Example, I would like feel better or some of them are targeted to like,
[51:33.110 --> 51:36.330]  oh, you're not going to blow or like, oh, this is going to make your hair grow.
[51:36.330 --> 51:39.470]  I've never noticed anything with anyone I've ever tried.
[51:40.170 --> 51:43.890]  And I think for a while and it it never did anything for me.
[51:44.190 --> 51:45.330]  I don't I don't want to make any.
[51:45.450 --> 51:46.530]  You know, I could be wrong about this.
[51:46.890 --> 51:48.670]  I feel like we're in different realms, though.
[51:48.830 --> 51:52.550]  Like I'm talking about vitamin C and you're talking about hair growth pills.
[51:52.590 --> 51:54.870]  And I don't feel like they're quite the same.
[51:55.750 --> 51:57.190]  I've also tried like a multivitamin.
[51:57.450 --> 51:59.330]  Yeah. With vitamin C in it.
[51:59.670 --> 52:00.890]  But how would you know whether it worked?
[52:01.450 --> 52:02.770]  I mean, I didn't feel any different.
[52:02.830 --> 52:04.030]  So I'm assuming I didn't do anything.
[52:04.030 --> 52:06.110]  Yeah, but I think I think you're supposed to.
[52:07.310 --> 52:12.890]  According according to Harvard University, if you take a multivitamin,
[52:12.970 --> 52:15.290]  it's probably because you want to do everything you can to protect your health.
[52:15.350 --> 52:18.650]  But there is still limited evidence that a daily cocktail of essential vitamins
[52:18.650 --> 52:21.090]  and minerals actually delivers what you expect.
[52:21.230 --> 52:25.690]  Most studies find no benefit from multivitamins in protecting brain or heart.
[52:26.330 --> 52:28.510]  Well, I'm just I straight up vitamin C.
[52:28.610 --> 52:29.950]  What about singular vitamins?
[52:30.310 --> 52:31.290]  But what are you OK?
[52:31.330 --> 52:32.490]  So you're saying vitamin C.
[52:32.490 --> 52:34.290]  What are you trying to do with vitamin C?
[52:34.750 --> 52:36.370]  I don't really know, to be honest.
[52:36.650 --> 52:39.530]  You're just you're just picking one and going for it.
[52:39.610 --> 52:43.270]  Well, it was when I first started to get like my cold.
[52:43.630 --> 52:48.470]  I got a big bottle of vitamin chewable vitamin C and I'm taking them.
[52:48.810 --> 52:51.130]  But I don't I just I feel I don't know.
[52:51.150 --> 52:53.930]  I feel like I've heard it's sort of like diet soda for me.
[52:54.110 --> 52:55.630]  I feel like I've heard it's better.
[52:55.850 --> 52:57.310]  I feel like I've heard it's worse.
[52:57.650 --> 52:58.850]  I feel like it flip flops.
[52:59.190 --> 53:00.010]  I just I don't know.
[53:00.010 --> 53:04.070]  I was hoping somebody here would have a more informed opinion on the effect.
[53:04.070 --> 53:07.370]  I mean, vitamin C doesn't it's not going to like cure the cold.
[53:07.490 --> 53:09.830]  It's vitamin C is just no, but like it'll help.
[53:09.910 --> 53:15.470]  Like, is there is there a value beyond if I like the taste of this and consuming it?
[53:15.810 --> 53:17.130]  Well, yeah, it depends on what you're like.
[53:17.330 --> 53:22.390]  I take potassium like often, like I'll eat a banana every day, whatever.
[53:22.590 --> 53:25.290]  I get a lot of like cramps, like leg cramps, foot cramps.
[53:25.390 --> 53:29.330]  And when I'm cramping and I take potassium, vitamin K,
[53:29.330 --> 53:31.610]  that helps me almost immediately.
[53:32.190 --> 53:36.430]  So, yes. Now, is that whether you take a pill or eat the banana?
[53:36.710 --> 53:41.030]  Because I would imagine the banana gets you a better form of potassium.
[53:41.450 --> 53:42.910]  It is. It's either way.
[53:43.050 --> 53:43.770]  It is interesting.
[53:44.030 --> 53:46.130]  Do you think that might be a placebo at this point?
[53:46.250 --> 53:51.890]  No, no, because the way that I'm feeling and the way that it works for me is,
[53:51.990 --> 53:55.050]  boy, it works because when I don't and you just try to go like,
[53:55.110 --> 53:56.990]  I don't need it this time and then you go, I'm in hell.
[53:57.050 --> 53:57.770]  I'm in hell. I'm in hell.
[53:57.770 --> 53:59.530]  Hey, I totally, totally get that.
[53:59.670 --> 54:01.290]  I feel the same way about Miralax.
[54:01.930 --> 54:02.470]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[54:04.070 --> 54:07.030]  But I don't think vitamin C does anything for like the cold.
[54:07.570 --> 54:12.310]  No, I just wondered if like, am I improving my body in any way?
[54:12.350 --> 54:13.390]  Like consuming this?
[54:13.630 --> 54:15.530]  It helps your body make collagen,
[54:17.730 --> 54:22.210]  which, you know, helps you grow skin and cartilage and tendons and stuff.
[54:23.010 --> 54:24.430]  I could use some tendons.
[54:25.070 --> 54:26.550]  Yeah, I like that idea.
[54:26.550 --> 54:27.650]  I could use some more tendon.
[54:28.050 --> 54:31.770]  I just don't know that the idea of the multivitamin has been proven to work.
[54:31.870 --> 54:33.610]  But like, yeah, I've made a bunch of oranges.
[54:33.810 --> 54:36.170]  You're going to get a benefit from the vitamin C that you eat that way.
[54:36.930 --> 54:39.210]  Because I feel like vitamin water doesn't work either, right?
[54:39.350 --> 54:41.370]  That's also like it filters out the vitamins.
[54:41.530 --> 54:42.730]  I feel like that does nothing.
[54:42.950 --> 54:43.990]  I don't know. Absolutely.
[54:45.110 --> 54:46.430]  Gavin, did you figure out your word yet or what?
[54:47.070 --> 54:48.430]  I'm looking through a.
[54:51.770 --> 54:55.090]  God, while you guys were Andrew or somebody was doing like a heartfelt
[54:55.090 --> 54:56.650]  talking about the end of the show or something,
[54:56.770 --> 54:58.930]  and I completely zoned out to try to find that stupid word,
[54:59.010 --> 55:00.130]  and I didn't get any, that's fine.
[55:02.170 --> 55:05.890]  We should probably say where people could go to find information
[55:05.890 --> 55:09.650]  about the next thing we'll do, which I would say is all of our personal socials.
[55:10.050 --> 55:12.450]  Yeah, I would say that our personal social media
[55:13.590 --> 55:17.790]  for me, that's at Eric Badoer on all social media.
[55:17.790 --> 55:20.210]  That'll be a place where we you can stay updated
[55:21.590 --> 55:22.890]  on what we're doing next.
[55:22.930 --> 55:24.970]  If you guys want to call out your personal socials,
[55:24.970 --> 55:26.330]  where people can find more information.
[55:26.910 --> 55:31.630]  Yeah, I'm on Instagram at at Geoff L. Ramsey and TikTok at Geoff's Daily Rip.
[55:31.690 --> 55:33.930]  I'll communicate both through both of those.
[55:34.070 --> 55:35.110]  Here's the thing, though.
[55:35.990 --> 55:40.850]  Next week on a Wednesday when Face is supposed to come out
[55:40.850 --> 55:43.830]  and you're like, oh, fuck, where's Face? It's over.
[55:44.830 --> 55:46.590]  It's not. It's it's coming out.
[55:46.650 --> 55:47.430]  It's a new thing.
[55:47.530 --> 55:50.130]  Just look, go to our socials and we'll tell you where it is
[55:50.130 --> 55:53.510]  and there will be a new thing and you'll go, oh, fuck, we didn't skip a beat.
[55:53.510 --> 55:56.870]  It's just like it never nothing ever stopped.
[55:57.150 --> 56:00.510]  There will be a regulation episode out
[56:01.010 --> 56:03.490]  just like you normally would have every Wednesday.
[56:03.930 --> 56:08.130]  Yes. And every Wednesday going forward until we can't make this any longer.
[56:08.470 --> 56:12.890]  I'm so excited to build that thing with all of you in our amazing community.
[56:13.010 --> 56:16.410]  Does anyone else want to say their social media so that we people?
[56:16.690 --> 56:20.830]  I'm at Andrew Pitton and I'm not at Rooster Teeth.
[56:20.830 --> 56:25.090]  So don't go there because I will not be posting there any updates.
[56:26.930 --> 56:27.970]  Gavin Free.
[56:30.350 --> 56:31.530]  Wasn't a joke, Nick.
[56:31.550 --> 56:32.170]  That's my name.
[56:32.570 --> 56:33.950]  That's the way you said it.
[56:34.510 --> 56:39.690]  I can't think of a more poignant way than to wrap up the last two hundred and
[56:40.810 --> 56:42.330]  six, five episodes
[56:43.450 --> 56:47.070]  that then all disinterestedly sharing our socials.
[56:47.510 --> 56:52.150]  Oh, wait, wait, Gavin, say say your name again.
[56:52.190 --> 56:52.990]  One second. Say it.
[56:53.050 --> 56:53.470]  It's Gavin Free.
[56:55.010 --> 56:56.090]  Now it's a joke.
[56:56.390 --> 57:00.050]  So is this the last episode that Eric will want us to end?
[57:01.090 --> 57:03.650]  No. Or will you keep up that shtick next time?
[57:03.950 --> 57:05.850]  Yeah. You think he's still the producer?
[57:06.070 --> 57:07.790]  He's still producing. Yeah, I need it to end.
[57:07.930 --> 57:09.190]  I have other things to do.
[57:09.270 --> 57:11.110]  We have so there's a bunch of other shit I'm getting.
[57:11.870 --> 57:13.410]  What other things are you going to have to do?
[57:13.950 --> 57:16.870]  I have people messaging me right now that are working for this current company
[57:16.870 --> 57:18.830]  saying, hey, I need you to call me ASAP.
[57:19.230 --> 57:21.850]  Oh, right. But what would what will they be?
[57:21.890 --> 57:23.030]  You won't have that next time.
[57:23.630 --> 57:25.090]  No, but I'll be working with different.
[57:25.410 --> 57:27.770]  I'll be working with different companies and different people
[57:27.770 --> 57:30.890]  to try to get us different opportunities and more things.
[57:30.890 --> 57:32.550]  So that way we can continue to do this.
[57:33.030 --> 57:33.970]  The growth doesn't end.
[57:34.050 --> 57:37.230]  As much as you all want to disinterestingly
[57:37.230 --> 57:40.710]  give your social media so we can sort of market this,
[57:40.730 --> 57:43.650]  which is something we failed to do for the last two years.
[57:44.410 --> 57:45.710]  It's two years to happen.
[57:45.890 --> 57:47.590]  We've never had marketing for the show.
[57:47.690 --> 57:49.770]  Yeah, every. I agree. Yeah, I agree.
[57:49.830 --> 57:51.830]  Can't even get in a fucking variety article.
[57:54.190 --> 57:56.190]  Is that why we should announce our new name?
[57:56.990 --> 57:57.730]  Yeah. Yeah.
[57:57.850 --> 57:59.870]  Find us in Variety. Variety's nuts.
[58:00.170 --> 58:03.490]  Fuck, dude, that really did piss me off.
[58:05.870 --> 58:10.250]  The most successful fucking thing the company had going for it, it got omitted.
[58:10.550 --> 58:11.130]  Oh, my God.
[58:11.130 --> 58:13.470]  Story of my fucking life.
[58:14.710 --> 58:18.810]  Clamoring for a little bit of respect for all the fucking hard work we're doing.
[58:19.190 --> 58:23.030]  I heard rumors that if this doesn't go well, Geoff's going to have to go back
[58:23.030 --> 58:25.570]  to Machinima, so please, please. Oh, God, no.
[58:27.310 --> 58:28.710]  Don't make me bob heads.
[58:30.770 --> 58:34.070]  I spent the last 15 minutes trying to find a fake word.
[58:34.550 --> 58:36.050]  I could easily just make up a new.
[58:36.990 --> 58:39.090]  I was going to I was going to say something,
[58:39.090 --> 58:41.310]  but you gotta give him enough rope to hang him, you know what I mean?
[58:41.770 --> 58:44.150]  So it was Clemens.
[58:45.110 --> 58:46.110]  Oh, that might have been it.
[58:46.630 --> 58:47.230]  Yeah. All right.
[58:47.510 --> 58:48.590]  I like the old one better.
[58:49.810 --> 58:50.530]  Oh, grungle.
[58:51.350 --> 58:54.250]  Uh, that actually sounded closer to the old one.
[58:54.870 --> 58:56.270]  That episode was a real zazzle.
[58:56.370 --> 58:57.270]  Do you guys want to take us out?
[58:57.530 --> 58:59.210]  Hell yeah. Yeah, let's do it.
[58:59.530 --> 59:01.070]  Did everyone say that heartfelt thing?
[59:01.550 --> 59:02.210]  Go for it, Gavin.
[59:02.810 --> 59:04.410]  I already did mine. You were ignoring it.
[59:04.890 --> 59:06.470]  Oh, I was trying to find your stupid word.
[59:06.930 --> 59:07.930]  What was that, you fool?
[59:07.930 --> 59:10.270]  What, Eric? I think I think like Warner,
[59:10.430 --> 59:12.770]  you should take this thing out back and just put a bullet in it.
[59:12.770 --> 59:14.570]  It's between the eyes.
[59:14.710 --> 59:16.370]  Oh, do we have a bullet sound?
[59:16.450 --> 59:18.250]  Should we just end on a on a gunshot?
[59:19.610 --> 59:21.610]  No, let's end like silence.
[59:23.170 --> 59:24.710]  Sopranos, that's someone's mouth.
[59:24.930 --> 59:25.810]  Yeah, that was me.
[59:25.970 --> 59:26.930]  It's the closest I got.
[59:28.770 --> 59:32.890]  We should take we should take real firing squad
[59:32.890 --> 59:35.730]  execution videos and put that sound over there.
[59:35.730 --> 59:40.590]  We should know it's a tasteful idea, but Lee.
[59:44.630 --> 59:46.530]  All right, well, I'll find it.
[59:46.670 --> 59:48.570]  Find us. OK, find us next week.
[59:48.710 --> 59:50.070]  Sorry, new episode.
[59:51.510 --> 59:53.850]  Very excited to continue this with you guys.
[59:53.950 --> 59:57.330]  Very excited for the fans who want to support us,
[59:57.330 --> 01:00:01.070]  can that can support us directly and help us grow
[01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:04.510]  and make the show the way that we want to make it.
[01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:06.990]  So that way you're getting the best version of it.
[01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.330]  But I just I think that'll do it.
[01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:12.730]  Yeah, I just process Gavin wanted to end this episode
[01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:16.330]  with an execution firing squad, and then it would go into me
[01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.750]  crying about how much the community is meant to us.
[01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.670]  I mean, it feels pretty par for the course.
[01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:24.530]  Oh, goddamn.
[01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.610]  I do want to say, though, before it before we do
[01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:30.110]  transition into Andrew crying again,
[01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:34.930]  I do I do want to say that I do think, you know, we've joked around about it.
[01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:36.610]  We've we've hemmed and hawed.
[01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:40.710]  But the future of what we're doing, I think, is very bright.
[01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:47.030]  And I want you, the audience, to know that we are all very excited about it.
[01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:48.810]  We're very invested in it.
[01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:49.710]  I am excited.
[01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.590]  I've spent twenty one years building shit like this.
[01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:56.870]  And I'm so fucking excited to be able to start over again and build it
[01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:01.910]  with the small, dedicated core of incredibly stupid people
[01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:05.470]  that is going to take this thing going forward.
[01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:09.530]  And I I just want I hope we've done a good job.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.610]  And I know we haven't because we don't do a good job of much,
[01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:16.650]  but of conveying to y'all that not only is this not slowing down or stopping,
[01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:19.930]  it's going to speed up and we're going to be bigger and better.
[01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:20.910]  It's going to take some time.
[01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:24.890]  And a lot of it is going to depend on you because we are now in your hands.
[01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:26.730]  And that's OK. We're very comfortable.
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:30.330]  We I think we've built a great relationship between the audience
[01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.970]  and the regulation crew.
[01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:37.370]  And I'm very excited to go forward with you guys on this new thing.
[01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:41.530]  And I really, really, really hope you'll tune in and and more so.
[01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:46.670]  I hope you'll tell people about it because we're entering into uncharted territory.
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.630]  There's no safety net going forward.
[01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:52.650]  And we really we really need to to to fucking nail it.
[01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.130]  And so it's going to take your help.
[01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.350]  But if you if you support us, we're going to do our goddamn
[01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.030]  best to make you laugh along the way.
[01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:00.730]  Sorry about my vagina.
[01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:05.010]  No, I'm not. It's like I'd beat off twice already.
[01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:09.230]  Back for ending in the camera.
[01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.690]  Fantastic. No, remember that wrestling let's play?
[01:02:18.850 --> 01:02:21.250]  All right, take it away, Andrew.
[01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:22.610]  See you next week.
[01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:32.290]  Hey, it's Andrew.
[01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:33.650]  I'm recording.
[01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:35.570]  This is a bone.
[01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:38.830]  I don't know. Bonus is the right word that makes it sound more fun than it is.
[01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.370]  I just wanted to record.
[01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:43.230]  This is the last episode of Face.
[01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.970]  A little message more aimed towards the audience.
[01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.710]  And there's a good chance I'll cry.
[01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:52.630]  So I didn't want to record this in a group setting.
[01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.030]  I'm I'm not that emotionally vulnerable.
[01:02:57.030 --> 01:03:02.010]  I try to be open and all that, but that is a little too much for me today.
[01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:05.510]  So I wrote some stuff down.
[01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:10.210]  I hope that me reading it and that I'm not just speaking from the top of my head
[01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:14.870]  doesn't minimize how genuine these words are and how much it means to me.
[01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:21.030]  As you may have heard, the company is closing.
[01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:23.690]  Shocking, I know, but it's true.
[01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:27.210]  And when I reflect on the past four years,
[01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:30.770]  it's impossible to
[01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.790]  succinctly describe what they've meant to me.
[01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:40.230]  One of the most rewarding parts of what we do in my eyes,
[01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:43.510]  at least, is getting to be part of this incredible community
[01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.550]  that we are so lucky to have have had formed around us.
[01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:50.170]  Sorry. Oh, man.
[01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:54.790]  I keep my DMs open and the amount of messages
[01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:58.210]  I've received over the years filled with kindness and support
[01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.870]  has been overwhelming in the best way.
[01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:03.510]  I try my best to reply to all of them.
[01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:08.430]  But if you're listening and I missed, you know, I'm genuinely sorry.
[01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:13.010]  The reason I bring this up is the most common thread in those messages
[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:19.290]  is a thanks for making this and how it has helped endure a time of darkness.
[01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:23.430]  What's important to me in this moment is that, you know, how aligned
[01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.910]  my feelings are, but towards you.
[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.130]  To everyone who is listening right now, I say with all of the weight in the world,
[01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:32.650]  thank you for allowing this ridiculous show to exist.
[01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:37.030]  It has changed my life forever, and I will feel indebted to you
[01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:38.610]  for the rest of my life.
[01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:43.650]  Like most people, these past years have been hard, and at times
[01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:47.990]  I felt as though I was drowning, but knowing that no matter what was happening,
[01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:52.090]  I was going to get to spend time every week trying to make my friends
[01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:53.850]  laugh was a constant light.
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:56.970]  I don't know how I navigated these years.
[01:04:57.190 --> 01:05:01.270]  Sorry, I fucked that up because I'm my throat is sore.
[01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:03.530]  My eyes are watery. I'm trying to read.
[01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:07.890]  I'm a mess, but I don't know how I would have navigated these years
[01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:08.690]  without the show.
[01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.990]  The space we have created is impossible without you.
[01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:14.750]  So as much as it is ours, it is yours.
[01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:19.970]  Although the company is, in fact, dying, that space will continue on,
[01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.870]  and I'm so excited to continue to build it all with you.
[01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:25.510]  Thank you so much for all the years of support.
[01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:29.690]  I'm so excited for us to start our next thing, which is going to be
[01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:32.990]  immediately following this like it's going to be no time has passed at all.
[01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:34.390]  It'll be on a different feed.
[01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:40.990]  But yeah, we we appreciate your support so much.
[01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:47.290]  It has been a truly amazing four years and hopefully many more to come.
[01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:52.750]  Thank you and have a wonderful rest of your day.
[01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:57.970]  Hey, guys, Major League fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of Face.
[01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:07.070]  And once again, Andrew never ate the pencil.
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:10.250]  All that and more was on this series called Face.
