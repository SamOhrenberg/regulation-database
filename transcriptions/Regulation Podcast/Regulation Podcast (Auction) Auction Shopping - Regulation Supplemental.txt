[00:00.000 --> 00:04.600]  Hello and welcome to another exciting piece of supplemental content.
[00:04.860 --> 00:07.860]  This is a historic piece of content we're about to make.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.580]  We're back on the prop store.
[00:10.980 --> 00:12.520]  There is a prop auction coming up.
[00:12.780 --> 00:18.080]  You may remember a time in the past we bought the tuxedo a long time ago
[00:18.560 --> 00:21.620]  and it was a prized possession and then we lost it.
[00:21.680 --> 00:23.640]  It's no longer ours. It's gone.
[00:24.360 --> 00:28.540]  And we've had a tuxedo outfit shaped hole in our hearts
[00:28.540 --> 00:31.800]  since that day that we are looking to fill.
[00:32.040 --> 00:36.120]  But this is we got a loaded lot of stuff to look through.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.500]  So what we're going to do today,
[00:37.540 --> 00:41.500]  this is the first part of will be potentially a series of videos
[00:41.500 --> 00:42.680]  around the auction today.
[00:42.800 --> 00:47.300]  We're scouting and coming up with what our auction day strategy will be.
[00:47.480 --> 00:50.240]  Because last time we did this, I was the only one around for the auction.
[00:50.540 --> 00:52.840]  This time, hopefully we'll have a few of us.
[00:53.020 --> 00:53.660]  It's our money.
[00:54.100 --> 00:57.460]  We'll be able to evaluate, not have to go through so many layers of people
[00:57.460 --> 01:02.080]  and determine what we want and also to like build up our collection
[01:02.620 --> 01:06.960]  of goods, get the museum going and just expand
[01:07.590 --> 01:11.160]  the lore of what we've we've consumed or what we own.
[01:11.840 --> 01:14.640]  But to do that, we have to do scouting.
[01:14.900 --> 01:16.620]  And there's a lot of stuff to scout.
[01:16.980 --> 01:18.680]  It's 77 pages.
[01:19.100 --> 01:21.680]  So we're going to condense it a little bit.
[01:22.140 --> 01:24.620]  Jesus, it's too much because I personally, I don't know.
[01:24.620 --> 01:27.660]  But you guys don't give a fuck about any Star Trek stuff.
[01:27.880 --> 01:30.700]  And there's like 15 pages of it.
[01:30.820 --> 01:32.540]  Oh, it's the same way about Star Wars.
[01:33.120 --> 01:34.660]  Is that the max items per page?
[01:35.900 --> 01:38.640]  So, no, you can you can increase the lots per page.
[01:38.860 --> 01:40.580]  Oh, yeah, there you go.
[01:40.760 --> 01:41.920]  Easy. Then it's only two pages.
[01:43.140 --> 01:45.800]  So you. Yeah, where do you want me to go, Andrew?
[01:47.000 --> 01:48.440]  Sorry, just let me open this up.
[01:48.540 --> 01:51.180]  So go into the Entertainment Memorabilia Live Auction,
[01:51.880 --> 01:53.240]  the L.A. one, scroll down.
[01:54.480 --> 01:56.380]  The screen. Oh, oh, I see.
[01:56.500 --> 01:58.740]  OK, so you catalog items here.
[01:59.020 --> 02:00.760]  Yep. Yeah. Go into the catalog.
[02:01.380 --> 02:05.880]  Whoa. And then increase the lots per page again.
[02:05.960 --> 02:09.760]  Jack Bauer. Oh, oh, shit. I want it. I want it. I want it.
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.300]  Damn. Naming your show 24 or 2000.
[02:14.580 --> 02:16.140]  Like this puts you at the front.
[02:16.380 --> 02:19.900]  We should rename this podcast Underscore Regulation Pod.
[02:19.900 --> 02:25.980]  Yeah. Oh, I want that.
[02:26.080 --> 02:26.900]  I want that to Yuma.
[02:27.380 --> 02:28.980]  Oh, man. Oh, I love that movie.
[02:29.620 --> 02:31.360]  So we it's our choice now.
[02:31.460 --> 02:33.680]  If we want, we could just start going through.
[02:33.920 --> 02:37.000]  Or if you want to narrow it down, you can click.
[02:37.220 --> 02:39.420]  There's a lot of pages. This is crazy.
[02:39.660 --> 02:40.500]  What do we filter by?
[02:40.700 --> 02:41.480]  Yeah, what do we filter?
[02:41.680 --> 02:46.320]  So so you categories and then you could do films and shows
[02:46.320 --> 02:48.780]  and that will list every film and show.
[02:49.240 --> 02:50.060]  That's a good idea.
[02:50.060 --> 02:51.420]  Click film and show not franchises.
[02:51.740 --> 02:53.000]  There you go. OK.
[02:53.240 --> 02:55.600]  And then let's just go through this list.
[02:55.960 --> 02:59.020]  Oh, and call out like, hey, I want to see the props for this.
[02:59.460 --> 03:01.880]  OK, I want to see the props.
[03:02.640 --> 03:04.380]  OK, are you just going to read it out or?
[03:04.540 --> 03:06.000]  I can. It's going to be a lot of things.
[03:06.060 --> 03:08.320]  We're going to just go through it, surely.
[03:10.960 --> 03:13.040]  Uh, it's like a thousand pages, though, isn't it?
[03:13.040 --> 03:15.420]  Yeah, it's I think it's 77 pages long.
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.360]  Yeah, I think it's I think it's like we can eliminate 100 items.
[03:18.360 --> 03:21.540]  There's like a lot here and there's a lot of stuff we don't want to see.
[03:21.800 --> 03:25.700]  But I think the first thing we want to see is clearly Ace Ventura.
[03:26.100 --> 03:26.300]  Yeah.
[03:27.680 --> 03:32.260]  I mean, I wouldn't mind seeing 48 hours, but that's a way too old for y'all.
[03:32.340 --> 03:33.240]  Probably. Yeah.
[03:34.720 --> 03:36.580]  Adam's family values would be awesome.
[03:37.120 --> 03:39.780]  Maybe that's like a pubert related thing.
[03:40.140 --> 03:41.880]  I didn't think about that.
[03:42.060 --> 03:44.360]  OK, this one, all the aliens.
[03:44.740 --> 03:45.500]  OK, all right.
[03:45.500 --> 03:46.180]  Be cool.
[03:46.340 --> 03:47.520]  OK, all the aliens.
[03:49.180 --> 03:50.160]  Airwolf, Air Force One.
[03:50.520 --> 03:52.260]  You can you can take resurrection off of there.
[03:52.360 --> 03:52.800]  That's OK.
[03:53.300 --> 03:55.280]  No way, baby. 97, we got to keep it on there.
[03:56.360 --> 03:58.920]  See, I want to say Amazing Spider-Man, but I'm not.
[03:59.040 --> 04:01.000]  I don't know. Is that something we really want to see?
[04:01.220 --> 04:02.600]  Yeah. Doesn't hurt.
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.240]  Yeah, sure. Doesn't help.
[04:04.360 --> 04:06.300]  We might as well just speed through the action.
[04:06.380 --> 04:07.660]  I think you're right, Gavin.
[04:07.780 --> 04:10.600]  I think based on how we're doing, let's just start scrolling through.
[04:11.160 --> 04:12.460]  310 to Yuma, very cool.
[04:12.620 --> 04:13.480]  All right, Ace Ventura.
[04:13.480 --> 04:14.360]  Right in the front.
[04:14.540 --> 04:16.040]  Right, right there, Ace Ventura.
[04:16.420 --> 04:18.980]  OK, I'll open it in a new tab.
[04:19.500 --> 04:20.320]  Was that used?
[04:22.640 --> 04:25.120]  This is a...
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.360]  Does it say?
[04:26.380 --> 04:30.880]  Hawaiian print shirt with a belt from Steve Odekirk's Ace Ventura, when nature calls.
[04:32.200 --> 04:35.440]  Ventura wore his tropical fish print Hawaiian shirt as he interrogated
[04:35.440 --> 04:37.340]  Safari Park owner Burton Quinn.
[04:37.540 --> 04:42.640]  And then later, when he was strapped to a raft, he wore his cowrie shell belt
[04:42.640 --> 04:44.560]  during the final circle of death trials.
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.600]  Yeah, I guess you wore them.
[04:46.180 --> 04:47.160]  Well, it's theoretical.
[04:47.780 --> 04:51.120]  A definitive is if it's screen matched, where they're able to verify
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.600]  this was in fact used.
[04:52.620 --> 04:54.580]  Where does it say that, if it's screen matched?
[04:54.580 --> 04:56.460]  It will note it in the description.
[04:56.660 --> 04:58.220]  So it'll say screen matched Ace Ventura.
[04:58.220 --> 04:59.400]  I wasn't finished. Let's see.
[05:00.120 --> 05:03.020]  This lot consists of one cotton button up short sleeve shirt
[05:03.020 --> 05:05.700]  with a colorful tropical theme print that consists of an island,
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.440]  it's sunset, yadda yadda yadda, and a faux brown leather belt
[05:09.010 --> 05:09.760]  and a decorative white.
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.640]  The lot exhibits a missing shell discoloration and adhesive residue.
[05:13.820 --> 05:15.220]  So it was probably used.
[05:15.640 --> 05:18.020]  I assume it stuck the dots on it or something.
[05:19.860 --> 05:24.720]  Hmm. I I have a feeling that this is a we got six of them
[05:24.720 --> 05:26.260]  in case one of them gets all messed up.
[05:26.380 --> 05:29.720]  We can't verify that this was used.
[05:29.880 --> 05:31.440]  Yeah, that sounds right. That is correct.
[05:31.700 --> 05:32.680]  If they could, it would say.
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.040]  OK, now an important thing to note about these auctions is it estimate
[05:37.040 --> 05:39.500]  the estimate between three thousand six thousand.
[05:40.040 --> 05:43.360]  That is you need the minimum of the estimate to get the item.
[05:43.520 --> 05:45.420]  So it starts at a thousand five hundred.
[05:45.980 --> 05:49.440]  But you will not get it unless you spend at least three thousand.
[05:50.820 --> 05:54.900]  And then there's a big percentage on top of that for the the premium.
[05:55.980 --> 05:57.320]  What does that mean? What's the premium?
[05:57.740 --> 06:00.180]  It's like a buyer's premium for every auction.
[06:00.300 --> 06:03.960]  It's like. Some percentage, it'll say on the website
[06:03.960 --> 06:05.080]  somewhere for the percentages.
[06:05.460 --> 06:07.400]  And that's what you're paying on top of it.
[06:07.500 --> 06:10.320]  On top of the final price. Yeah. Wow. Wow.
[06:10.540 --> 06:11.980]  Tell us how much it is. Damn you.
[06:13.160 --> 06:14.320]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[06:14.660 --> 06:18.260]  OK, I'll keep this tab open because we can come back to it.
[06:18.320 --> 06:20.480]  You know what I mean? Like feeling good about it.
[06:20.960 --> 06:24.020]  I feel like when we evaluate this merchandise, too, because I know
[06:24.020 --> 06:27.000]  we want to have it for the collection, we want to build this collection.
[06:28.080 --> 06:30.520]  I don't know what we want to do with it yet, but whatever we do with it.
[06:30.640 --> 06:32.620]  But I feel like we also are buying stuff
[06:32.620 --> 06:35.500]  that specifically will be worn by people in regulation.
[06:35.700 --> 06:38.040]  So this seems like something Gavin would wear, right?
[06:38.380 --> 06:41.000]  Oh, Gavin's literally the Jim Carrey guy. Huge.
[06:41.120 --> 06:42.240]  My favorite person.
[06:42.580 --> 06:44.660]  Yeah, he's like, I can't imagine anybody else.
[06:44.940 --> 06:46.580]  This this seems so perfect for you, Gav.
[06:47.380 --> 06:50.120]  The buyer's premium is 25%.
[06:51.320 --> 06:53.000]  Woof. God damn.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.940]  So did Rooster Teeth, Rooster Teeth, did Rooster Teeth have to pay that when
[06:58.040 --> 07:00.180]  when they bought, when we bought the tuxedo? I assume so.
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.240]  Probably.
[07:02.640 --> 07:04.040]  I wasn't a part of that process.
[07:04.660 --> 07:05.340]  Do you remember that, Andrew?
[07:06.220 --> 07:10.100]  I just was told what my max bid was, and I put that in.
[07:10.520 --> 07:10.800]  OK.
[07:13.140 --> 07:14.600]  OK, OK. All right.
[07:15.800 --> 07:17.220]  OK, so we got that one.
[07:17.300 --> 07:18.500]  That's our first of maybe.
[07:19.300 --> 07:22.260]  Here's the jacket from Prototype Jacket.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.000]  That's pretty cool.
[07:23.160 --> 07:23.900]  From Alien.
[07:24.460 --> 07:25.320]  Here's more.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.300]  Holy shit. Estimate $250,000.
[07:29.300 --> 07:31.820]  It's the actual Nostromo model.
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.020]  Wow. Wow.
[07:33.260 --> 07:35.780]  Where's that been sat for 50 years?
[07:36.060 --> 07:36.680]  In a warehouse.
[07:37.300 --> 07:38.500]  On those casters.
[07:39.200 --> 07:40.740]  Yep. I don't.
[07:40.840 --> 07:42.580]  I would never want to own a face hugger.
[07:43.160 --> 07:45.000]  There's. No, absolutely not.
[07:45.160 --> 07:46.400]  It makes me uncomfortable to see.
[07:46.420 --> 07:47.460]  No, thank you. I don't want it in my life.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.740]  Not a chance.
[07:49.200 --> 07:51.480]  One of the most disturbing things ever created in film.
[07:51.700 --> 07:53.020]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's awful.
[07:53.800 --> 07:55.560]  There's that new alien movie coming out.
[07:55.600 --> 07:58.040]  Have you seen the ones that like skitter around or whatever?
[07:58.040 --> 08:00.140]  Yeah. They're like little like remote control things.
[08:00.360 --> 08:02.320]  Yeah. Yeah. It's scary.
[08:02.840 --> 08:04.080]  Wait, why is a strap?
[08:04.680 --> 08:06.220]  I was about to say the same thing.
[08:06.300 --> 08:08.620]  I'm like, dude, maybe we should jump on that because it's going to be cheap.
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.400]  Estimates $5,000 to $10,000.
[08:11.020 --> 08:11.880]  What? It's aliens.
[08:12.380 --> 08:13.500]  It's a James Cameron classic.
[08:13.980 --> 08:14.580]  God damn.
[08:14.920 --> 08:18.760]  Well, and also, I don't know that we have a deep connection to aliens.
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.000]  You know? Not yet.
[08:20.300 --> 08:21.420]  It's cool. Universal.
[08:21.780 --> 08:22.900]  It is cool. Very cool.
[08:23.700 --> 08:24.100]  Armageddon.
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.380]  Yeah. Michael Clarke.
[08:26.400 --> 08:27.720]  Duncan suit. Ram.
[08:31.120 --> 08:31.920]  That's crazy.
[08:32.220 --> 08:32.740]  Wow. America.
[08:33.120 --> 08:34.800]  I like one bit of 8000.
[08:35.340 --> 08:36.780]  Well, yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.100]  I'm on the fence.
[08:39.220 --> 08:39.480]  Damn.
[08:40.740 --> 08:42.300]  Oh, do you think a bit of 8000?
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.140]  It's just like his way of bookmarking it.
[08:44.640 --> 08:45.500]  Yeah, I don't know.
[08:45.560 --> 08:46.380]  I'll come back to this.
[08:46.900 --> 08:50.640]  Curious, like what the value is, because there must be a reason to it.
[08:50.900 --> 08:52.180]  But I don't know what it is.
[08:52.180 --> 08:53.020]  Oh, Batman.
[08:54.340 --> 08:55.740]  Oh, production made.
[08:55.980 --> 08:57.500]  Speaking of outfits made for Gavin.
[08:58.280 --> 09:00.660]  Yeah. Smiley Joker girl standing.
[09:02.140 --> 09:03.780]  That does seem like you, Gav.
[09:04.680 --> 09:07.040]  Man, that almanac is great, but 20 grand.
[09:07.460 --> 09:07.880]  Yeah, right.
[09:07.940 --> 09:10.340]  That I mean, that's the thing that turns me off is so much of this stuff
[09:10.340 --> 09:11.480]  where it's just like, dude, get real.
[09:11.900 --> 09:15.620]  That's such an iconic problem. Screen matched Batman Batwing.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.620]  Six foot motorized film model.
[09:18.220 --> 09:20.600]  $250,000 to $500,000.
[09:20.600 --> 09:24.760]  Can you imagine winning that for $500,000 and then you owe 25% again?
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.400]  Oh, no. Jesus Christ.
[09:31.100 --> 09:32.860]  Dude, this is crazy.
[09:33.140 --> 09:34.740]  Oh, look at the penguin.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.280]  Oh, that's pretty cool. That's amazing.
[09:37.620 --> 09:39.200]  That yeah, I like the penguin a lot.
[09:39.920 --> 09:41.300]  I wish it wasn't $16,000.
[09:41.840 --> 09:44.260]  Yeah, no kidding. It's just the max. Damn.
[09:44.960 --> 09:46.740]  What about Danny DeVito's feet?
[09:46.940 --> 09:48.040]  What about his penguin feet?
[09:51.200 --> 09:52.600]  Talking about noob boogoofing.
[09:55.500 --> 09:56.760]  I would like those.

[10:23.060 --> 10:26.040]  I don't like when they autograph the things that's a little bit different
[10:26.040 --> 10:29.020]  because it's a photo, but like when there's a prop that's been autographed,
[10:29.040 --> 10:31.400]  it ruins it for me. Yeah, I get it. I get it.
[10:32.300 --> 10:33.860]  You want it. You want it screen perfect.

[14:41.540 --> 14:42.660]  Oh, that's awesome.
[14:44.140 --> 14:45.060]  That's a stunt telephone.

[15:07.400 --> 15:08.280]  Cinderella Man?
[15:08.500 --> 15:09.140]  Oh, my God.
[15:09.380 --> 15:11.020]  He was going for a metaphor with those knives.
[15:11.980 --> 15:12.420]  Constantine?
[15:12.580 --> 15:13.500]  Does that mean anything to anyone?

[15:21.560 --> 15:23.320]  Dude, Stormare killed it in that role.
[15:23.520 --> 15:24.160]  He was awesome.

[15:36.420 --> 15:37.460]  Hang on.
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.720]  Is this where he walks around with a sandwich board?
[15:41.300 --> 15:42.640]  No, this is where he's on a subway.
[15:42.640 --> 15:43.040]  No, that's after.
[15:43.260 --> 15:43.440]  Okay.
[15:44.100 --> 15:44.380]  Yeah.
[15:46.320 --> 15:46.840]  Damn.

[15:49.380 --> 15:50.420]  Dude, that's crazy.
[15:50.820 --> 15:52.580]  I guess they'll never auction that sandwich board.
[15:53.200 --> 15:53.480]  Yep.
[15:53.860 --> 15:54.540]  Probably not.
[15:54.700 --> 15:57.600]  I think it was actually blank anyway for the film.
[15:57.640 --> 15:57.820]  Yeah.
[15:58.540 --> 15:59.060]  Goofy!
[15:59.600 --> 16:00.600]  What the fuck?

[16:03.900 --> 16:04.620]  Dogma wings.
[16:04.860 --> 16:05.420]  Dogma wings.
[16:05.820 --> 16:06.300]  Holy shit.
[16:06.300 --> 16:07.620]  How is that worth that?
[16:08.280 --> 16:08.340]  Wow.
[16:08.340 --> 16:08.380]  Yeah.
[16:08.480 --> 16:09.300]  Oh, it's cable controlled.
[16:09.960 --> 16:10.640]  Oh, that's why.
[16:12.140 --> 16:12.760]  Demolition, man.
[16:13.040 --> 16:13.380]  Demolition, man.
[16:13.580 --> 16:14.900]  Too expensive for demolition.
[16:14.900 --> 16:15.460]  Dumber, dumber.
[16:15.880 --> 16:16.320]  Ooh.
[16:16.520 --> 16:17.680]  Bloodied barber cape.
[16:18.340 --> 16:19.360]  You want to check it out?
[16:19.900 --> 16:20.960]  I don't even remember that scene.
[16:22.100 --> 16:23.220]  Yeah, let's look at it.
[16:23.400 --> 16:24.440]  Maybe there's an image of the scene.
[16:24.440 --> 16:24.720]  It's when he gets his...
[16:24.720 --> 16:25.340]  Oh, right.
[16:25.520 --> 16:25.740]  Yeah.
[16:25.940 --> 16:26.200]  Oh.
[16:26.420 --> 16:26.900]  Oh, yeah.
[16:27.320 --> 16:29.200]  That's such a small moment in the film.
[16:31.960 --> 16:34.640]  What a screenshot of what you have.
[16:36.900 --> 16:42.440]  Teal polyester barber cape features a snapped clothes collar covered in red stains from
[16:42.440 --> 16:43.020]  stage blood.
[16:44.140 --> 16:44.660]  That's great.
[16:45.400 --> 16:46.220]  You mean it's not ketchup?
[16:46.460 --> 16:47.600]  Come on.
[16:50.960 --> 16:51.680]  Dread.
[16:52.000 --> 16:52.880]  Edge of tomorrow.
[16:54.620 --> 16:56.080]  Evil Dead 2.
[16:56.920 --> 16:57.920]  That's so...
[16:57.920 --> 16:58.880]  That's so...
[16:58.880 --> 16:59.800]  Oh, my God.
[16:59.900 --> 17:00.140]  Oh.
[17:00.660 --> 17:01.580]  You need 160,000.
[17:01.580 --> 17:02.560]  Yeah, it's worth it.
[17:02.720 --> 17:03.320]  That's okay, though.
[17:03.920 --> 17:05.560]  We can dig deep.
[17:05.780 --> 17:06.640]  That's real penis skin.
[17:08.360 --> 17:09.080]  You guys are nuts.
[17:10.200 --> 17:10.860]  Oh, shit.
[17:10.860 --> 17:12.520]  Oh, they're gold pistols.
[17:12.820 --> 17:13.040]  Oh, fuck.
[17:13.980 --> 17:14.820]  Oh, they're cheap.
[17:16.300 --> 17:17.060]  I'm sorry.
[17:17.420 --> 17:19.820]  In what world are they cheap?
[17:19.840 --> 17:21.860]  Compared to everything else we've looked at.
[17:22.800 --> 17:26.480]  I mean, if you figure you get it for six, you're really only paying three grand each.
[17:26.520 --> 17:27.280]  I mean, come on.
[17:27.380 --> 17:28.360]  Yeah, three grand a golden gun.
[17:28.380 --> 17:28.860]  You'd be stupid.
[17:28.860 --> 17:29.920]  I'm stupid not to buy them.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.340]  That's a good point, Nick.
[17:31.620 --> 17:32.580]  That's so funny.
[17:33.980 --> 17:34.760]  Let's see.
[17:35.380 --> 17:36.860]  Tom Cruise hat.
[17:37.340 --> 17:38.560]  It's the autographed.
[17:38.640 --> 17:39.320]  I don't like that.
[17:39.320 --> 17:39.780]  I don't like that.
[17:40.040 --> 17:42.300]  Oh, is that Ed Norton's plaid suit costume?
[17:46.440 --> 17:47.420]  Flash Gordon!
[17:47.660 --> 17:48.880]  Oh, wow, dude.
[17:49.080 --> 17:51.440]  I fucking loved that movie when I was a kid.
[17:52.040 --> 17:52.220]  That's so funny.
[17:52.220 --> 17:53.320]  That never left the universe.
[17:54.700 --> 17:56.240]  Screen match face mask.
[17:56.460 --> 17:56.820]  Oh.
[17:57.720 --> 17:58.720]  Oh, my God.
[17:58.720 --> 17:58.780]  Oh, my God.
[17:58.780 --> 17:58.800]  Oh, my God.
[17:58.800 --> 17:58.840]  Oh, my God.
[17:58.840 --> 18:00.600]  Oh, Friday the 13th.
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.200]  The worst Friday the 13th.
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.740]  No, Jason in space was worse.
[18:05.160 --> 18:05.360]  Yeah.
[18:05.460 --> 18:07.340]  Oh, is that the box of chocolates?
[18:07.560 --> 18:08.740]  I don't know if I agree with that.
[18:09.600 --> 18:11.200]  Millie and I just watched them like two years ago.
[18:12.280 --> 18:13.040]  They're bad.
[18:13.240 --> 18:15.680]  You could you could just have that and be like, life is like this.
[18:16.280 --> 18:18.220]  This is exactly this right here.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.260]  This is what life is like.
[18:19.360 --> 18:19.580]  Yeah.
[18:20.940 --> 18:23.120]  If you have life that.
[18:23.280 --> 18:24.100]  Oh, what a prop.
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.780]  This isn't even from the box of chocolates.
[18:27.160 --> 18:28.640]  This is the one that he, like, gives.
[18:28.820 --> 18:29.300]  Jenny.
[18:30.440 --> 18:32.880]  Oh, it's also not safe for consumption.
[18:33.280 --> 18:34.100]  Oh, boo.
[18:34.720 --> 18:35.200]  Boo.
[18:35.580 --> 18:36.980]  I mean, the box or the chocolate.
[18:40.280 --> 18:42.380]  Basic training fatigues for Forrest Gump.
[18:42.620 --> 18:43.040]  That's OK.
[18:44.760 --> 18:46.120]  From dusk till dawn.
[18:46.880 --> 18:47.360]  Wow.
[18:47.720 --> 18:49.580]  Oh, you get Jamie Lannister's hand.
[18:49.940 --> 18:50.320]  Wow.
[18:50.540 --> 18:50.920]  Gavin.
[18:52.020 --> 18:53.080]  That's pretty cool.
[18:53.280 --> 18:53.760]  That's funny.
[18:56.330 --> 18:58.250]  Oh, Guns of the Doctors was a good movie.
[18:59.450 --> 19:00.450]  Oh, Gangs of New York.
[19:00.550 --> 19:01.270]  Bill the Butcher hat.
[19:01.510 --> 19:01.730]  Wow.
[19:01.730 --> 19:06.470]  Slime is looking a bit ropey.
[19:06.590 --> 19:07.250]  Stay puffed.
[19:07.250 --> 19:08.410]  Marshmallow Man's hat.
[19:08.810 --> 19:09.530]  Is that huge?
[19:10.170 --> 19:11.350]  That hat just massive.
[19:12.290 --> 19:16.510]  Do you think that Marshmallow Man was the size that he was in the movie, Andrew?
[19:17.150 --> 19:17.630]  No.
[19:18.270 --> 19:19.250]  Are you sure?
[19:19.450 --> 19:26.050]  It seems like I know that there wasn't a giant marshmallow man in New York.
[19:27.650 --> 19:28.890]  If you say so.
[19:28.950 --> 19:30.810]  I mean, I'm just making sure.
[19:30.810 --> 19:33.330]  He just turned away from his mic to cry a little bit about it.
[19:35.470 --> 19:37.130]  It's 17 by 14 by 4.
[19:40.310 --> 19:41.290]  Those are numbers.
[19:41.430 --> 19:41.950]  A big beret.
[19:43.170 --> 19:44.850]  But it might just fit on a normal man's head.
[19:45.010 --> 19:46.150]  Not city size, though.
[19:46.510 --> 19:47.570]  I bet it wouldn't fit on mine.
[19:51.170 --> 19:53.390]  And proton packs from the other Ghostbusters movies.
[19:53.970 --> 19:54.310]  Wow.
[19:54.390 --> 19:54.690]  It's weird.
[19:54.970 --> 19:57.370]  It's really weird that these are so much less.
[19:58.110 --> 19:58.470]  Strange.
[19:58.670 --> 19:59.930]  When they look so much cooler.
[19:59.930 --> 20:01.490]  Something to think about, I guess.
[20:01.990 --> 20:02.750]  Gladiator sword.
[20:02.910 --> 20:06.930]  Dude, Ralphie would be going crazy for this shit, dude.
[20:11.190 --> 20:13.170]  Is Joey joking around there, man?
[20:13.490 --> 20:15.710]  My friend's dad made those, I think.
[20:15.970 --> 20:16.210]  Really?
[20:16.530 --> 20:16.730]  What?
[20:16.810 --> 20:17.230]  Oh, really?
[20:17.910 --> 20:20.090]  Like those specific ones or just for fun?
[20:20.190 --> 20:22.930]  I think he was a prop maker for Gladiator.
[20:23.830 --> 20:24.770]  That's crazy.
[20:25.030 --> 20:26.110]  God, that movie ruled.
[20:28.110 --> 20:28.450]  Wow.
[20:28.910 --> 20:29.670]  I can't believe that.
[20:29.670 --> 20:32.470]  You could probably get him to make one for a lot less than $140,000.
[20:32.490 --> 20:33.510]  Yeah, probably a lot less.
[20:33.990 --> 20:36.290]  Dude, there's a lot of Gladiator stuff.
[20:36.370 --> 20:37.030]  What happened?
[20:38.390 --> 20:39.250]  This is crazy.
[20:40.110 --> 20:44.870]  Some of it said before Russell Crowe's collection, so I wondered if he gave up a lot of stuff.
[20:45.150 --> 20:47.010]  Or if it's just stuff around him.
[20:47.250 --> 20:49.970]  He might have had an IRS bill recently or something.
[20:50.830 --> 20:53.390]  Oh, the goonies!
[20:54.570 --> 20:55.770]  Data's stunt coat!
[20:55.770 --> 20:59.170]  Oh, shit.
[20:59.510 --> 21:00.450]  Oh, the golden child next to it.
[21:00.470 --> 21:02.730]  50 fucking grand.
[21:03.070 --> 21:05.270]  We could get beauty school dropout smock dress!
[21:05.830 --> 21:06.730]  Golden child's pretty cool, too.
[21:06.730 --> 21:09.410]  Fuck that, I want the Happy Gilmore screen match.
[21:09.610 --> 21:09.750]  Yeah!
[21:10.390 --> 21:11.030]  Oh, wow.
[21:11.630 --> 21:13.070]  Weasley Quidditch cape.
[21:16.550 --> 21:20.950]  Dude, $20,000 to $40,000 for this light-up wand.
[21:21.390 --> 21:24.270]  God, this fucking screen match that ruins Jersey.
[21:25.010 --> 21:26.090]  It sure is.
[21:26.390 --> 21:27.390]  Oh, it is really cool.
[21:27.630 --> 21:28.450]  I could wear that.
[21:28.770 --> 21:30.470]  I could definitely wear that.
[21:31.990 --> 21:33.550]  A lot of Harry Potter stuff.
[21:34.130 --> 21:35.550]  A lot of Harry Potter stuff.
[21:36.830 --> 21:38.190]  Yeah, we can just skip right through it.
[21:38.350 --> 21:39.090]  Yeah, we can skip right through it.
[21:39.210 --> 21:40.430]  I don't think anyone else is going to...
[21:40.430 --> 21:40.810]  Uh-oh.
[21:41.310 --> 21:43.970]  Oh, now that's a classic!
[21:46.510 --> 21:48.290]  Cable-controlled Harry mask.
[21:48.610 --> 21:49.010]  Oh!
[21:50.190 --> 21:51.850]  I wanted it, I wanted it, I wanted it!
[21:52.050 --> 21:53.870]  Man, I'm surprised that's in one piece.
[21:53.870 --> 21:54.930]  Yeah, really?
[21:55.090 --> 21:55.990]  That's crazy.
[21:56.570 --> 21:58.450]  That seems like... that's practically free!
[21:59.230 --> 22:03.270]  It'll... it... like, coming to you will fall... it will disintegrate.
[22:03.630 --> 22:03.910]  No.
[22:04.110 --> 22:05.370]  Like, on its way to you.
[22:06.930 --> 22:11.210]  I like that Nick is the most excited about this. The monkey mask guy.
[22:11.650 --> 22:20.390]  Following production, this mask underwent sympathetic restoration and repainting to damaged foam latex on its nose, cheeks, forehead, and lips.
[22:20.710 --> 22:22.370]  It remains brittle and stiff.
[22:22.370 --> 22:23.590]  Look, you can see.
[22:24.190 --> 22:27.270]  If we get that, I'll wear it at the mall with the boots.
[22:28.010 --> 22:29.550]  You can't, it's too brittle!
[22:30.190 --> 22:32.070]  Yeah, look, it's already fallen apart.
[22:32.410 --> 22:34.150]  It's all fucked up, dude.
[22:34.190 --> 22:39.150]  Did you ever see the hoggle they found from Labyrinth after they lost it for like 20 years?
[22:39.270 --> 22:40.030]  They found it in a suitcase.
[22:40.750 --> 22:41.350]  It's horrific.
[22:41.770 --> 22:42.750]  You should look at it afterwards.
[22:43.190 --> 22:43.330]  Okay.
[22:45.210 --> 22:46.090]  Ooh, Highlander.
[22:46.370 --> 22:48.110]  Some Highlander stuff.
[22:48.910 --> 22:49.970]  Stunt hooks from Hook.
[22:52.290 --> 22:53.330]  Independence Day.
[22:56.030 --> 22:58.310]  How are they going to get a ship that big?
[22:59.170 --> 23:01.110]  Screen and photo matched fedora.
[23:01.970 --> 23:03.110]  Half a million dollars.
[23:03.270 --> 23:03.730]  Oh, I'm out.
[23:03.950 --> 23:04.450]  Wow.
[23:05.610 --> 23:06.790]  Temple of Doom, though.
[23:07.410 --> 23:07.630]  Yeah.
[23:08.370 --> 23:11.170]  Ooh, the Sankara Stone. I would take that.
[23:12.350 --> 23:12.870]  Moonraker!
[23:14.150 --> 23:17.710]  Gavin, could you rig the Moonraker gun to shoot hot dogs?
[23:19.970 --> 23:22.010]  Can you click on that? What's the scale of it?
[23:22.490 --> 23:23.630]  Poncho machine gun.
[23:24.050 --> 23:24.230]  Yeah.
[23:25.850 --> 23:26.710]  Here's the sizing.
[23:26.970 --> 23:28.490]  Oh, yeah, it's like a...
[23:30.430 --> 23:34.610]  It's like a Mexican that splits in half and becomes a gun.
[23:34.630 --> 23:36.290]  Oh, right, I forgot about that.
[23:36.410 --> 23:37.690]  I forgot about that!
[23:38.750 --> 23:40.790]  It's a ridiculous prop.
[23:41.450 --> 23:41.590]  Yeah.
[23:42.550 --> 23:43.790]  Where's the rest of the prop?
[23:44.190 --> 23:45.450]  Where's the guy who's splitting in half?
[23:45.850 --> 23:47.810]  Yeah, how come there's no guy who's splitting in half?
[23:47.810 --> 23:49.030]  Where is he?
[23:50.410 --> 23:51.810]  Hope he got paid extra money.
[23:52.250 --> 23:54.330]  Ownership may be restricted in some countries.
[23:58.010 --> 23:58.710]  That's great.
[23:58.950 --> 23:59.510]  Oh, man.
[24:00.210 --> 24:01.430]  That is a hot dog cannon.
[24:01.650 --> 24:02.110]  Look at that.
[24:02.730 --> 24:03.170]  Octopussy!
[24:04.110 --> 24:06.190]  Moonraker helmet. Any of this do anything for you, Gavin?
[24:06.990 --> 24:07.390]  Nah.
[24:07.830 --> 24:08.030]  Oh.
[24:08.090 --> 24:08.270]  Yeah.
[24:08.570 --> 24:09.050]  I guess not.
[24:09.290 --> 24:09.530]  Ooh.
[24:09.610 --> 24:10.690]  I'm not a poker chip guy.
[24:11.990 --> 24:15.290]  There's just so many of those. You see those at every hot dog auction.
[24:15.790 --> 24:16.130]  There is, yeah.
[24:16.130 --> 24:17.650]  I would have made like a thousand of them.
[24:18.050 --> 24:18.470]  Ooh.
[24:18.990 --> 24:19.510]  Ooh.
[24:19.670 --> 24:20.530]  Skyfall suit.
[24:21.410 --> 24:21.930]  50k.
[24:23.290 --> 24:25.390]  Police patch for six grand.
[24:25.530 --> 24:26.290]  That's very neat, though.
[24:26.870 --> 24:28.630]  Chart, like, original Jaws.
[24:29.650 --> 24:30.510]  John Wick bike.
[24:31.170 --> 24:31.690]  Jumanji!
[24:32.390 --> 24:34.370]  Early paint test game board cover.
[24:34.870 --> 24:35.490]  That's really cool.
[24:35.770 --> 24:36.490]  I love that movie.
[24:36.870 --> 24:38.170]  It's a really good movie.
[24:38.390 --> 24:39.630]  Oh, Jurassic Park license.
[24:39.850 --> 24:41.850]  David Alan Greer is so fucking great in that film.
[24:45.090 --> 24:47.770]  Any of these, like, what are, these are just display things?
[24:47.870 --> 24:48.630]  Like, what are these?
[24:49.750 --> 24:50.490]  Yeah, I don't know.
[24:50.630 --> 24:50.970]  I don't know.
[24:52.150 --> 24:53.510]  Maybe they were used in close-ups.
[24:53.910 --> 24:54.050]  Yeah.
[24:54.290 --> 24:55.030]  Oh, yeah.
[24:55.570 --> 24:57.230]  And this, like, here's like the paint test.
[24:57.550 --> 24:58.930]  Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[24:59.850 --> 25:01.650]  It's not like the brochure, I think it's cool.
[25:01.990 --> 25:02.610]  Yeah, I think that's neat.
[25:04.550 --> 25:04.910]  Oh!
[25:05.330 --> 25:06.450]  I could take those sunglasses.
[25:07.730 --> 25:08.010]  Kingston.
[25:08.430 --> 25:08.490]  Dodgson!
[25:10.170 --> 25:11.430]  We got Dodgson here!
[25:11.710 --> 25:12.650]  We got Dodgson.
[25:12.650 --> 25:13.350]  Dodgson!
[25:14.410 --> 25:15.090]  Nobody cares.
[25:21.170 --> 25:22.030]  Oh, hang on.
[25:23.490 --> 25:25.390]  I want to see what their setup looks like.
[25:25.430 --> 25:25.690]  Hang on.
[25:29.070 --> 25:29.390]  Wes?
[25:29.470 --> 25:31.370]  It's just a guy in a t-shirt with a camera, huh?
[25:31.930 --> 25:32.210]  Nice.
[25:32.290 --> 25:34.550]  Not really anything super impressive here.
[25:34.710 --> 25:36.350]  He's just kind of put it on like a white background.
[25:36.550 --> 25:37.230]  Kind of lazy.
[25:37.490 --> 25:38.590]  Get yourself a reflection.
[25:38.810 --> 25:39.370]  I just wanted to see.
[25:39.650 --> 25:40.530]  Oh, man.
[25:41.390 --> 25:41.870]  Roy Munson.
[25:41.870 --> 25:43.030]  Roy Munson's fedora.
[25:43.730 --> 25:44.530]  That's cool.
[25:44.890 --> 25:45.450]  That's really cool.
[25:45.690 --> 25:46.430]  Roy Munson's bullet mask.
[25:46.430 --> 25:46.850]  Oh, here you go.
[25:46.930 --> 25:47.890]  You can be the whole thing, Geoff.
[25:48.470 --> 25:49.910]  I would also do that.
[25:50.270 --> 25:52.110]  That also feels right up my alley.
[25:54.110 --> 25:57.030]  I feel like the people that like Kingpin love Kingpin.
[25:57.410 --> 25:57.730]  I agree.
[25:57.890 --> 25:59.430]  There isn't much of a middle ground on Kingpin.
[25:59.850 --> 26:00.250]  Whoa!
[26:03.650 --> 26:05.250]  Autographed by the cast, Geoff.
[26:05.390 --> 26:06.070]  Boo Boo Kitty.
[26:07.270 --> 26:08.830]  Were you a big Boo Boo Kitty guy?
[26:09.390 --> 26:10.430]  No, but I remember it.
[26:10.490 --> 26:11.390]  It was a big part of the show.
[26:11.390 --> 26:14.010]  It was Carmine Ragu.
[26:14.670 --> 26:16.270]  Carmine Ragusa, was that his name?
[26:16.570 --> 26:17.530]  They called him the Big Ragu.
[26:18.730 --> 26:19.290]  Man.
[26:19.610 --> 26:20.130]  He was a boxer.
[26:21.030 --> 26:21.570]  There you go.
[26:23.390 --> 26:24.490]  Autographed by everyone.
[26:24.590 --> 26:25.910]  Everyone said, let me sign this thing.
[26:26.070 --> 26:26.670]  Lethal Weapon.
[26:27.050 --> 26:29.510]  Oh, screen matched.
[26:30.890 --> 26:31.590]  Lethal Weapon 3.
[26:31.710 --> 26:32.370]  I got shot a bunch of times.
[26:32.590 --> 26:32.930]  Worse.
[26:34.930 --> 26:39.930]  One thing that always bugged me about the Lethal Weapon series is in Lethal Weapon 1,
[26:42.410 --> 26:45.470]  he's an insane badass martial arts expert.
[26:45.950 --> 26:49.350]  And then in Lethal Weapons 2 through whatever, he no longer is.
[26:49.770 --> 26:53.230]  They just like dropped that whole Mel Gibson can beat anybody up storyline.
[26:54.190 --> 26:55.090]  Suddenly he's just a dude.
[26:55.130 --> 26:56.130]  Look at the state of that hammer.
[26:56.770 --> 26:57.410]  Weighted hammer.
[26:58.150 --> 26:58.370]  Yeah.
[26:59.750 --> 27:00.650]  80 grand.
[27:00.830 --> 27:02.410]  It's only $40,000 to $80,000.
[27:02.910 --> 27:03.150]  Easy.
[27:04.410 --> 27:05.750]  Missed the extra zero.
[27:06.010 --> 27:06.090]  Whoops.
[27:06.490 --> 27:07.910]  Here you go, you can be the Punisher.
[27:08.290 --> 27:08.830]  Oh, hell yeah.
[27:08.830 --> 27:09.430]  Alright.
[27:10.910 --> 27:11.670]  Yeah, that show was good.
[27:13.130 --> 27:13.870]  Never saw that.
[27:14.270 --> 27:14.930]  The show was very good.
[27:14.970 --> 27:16.090]  Are these like from something?
[27:16.210 --> 27:17.290]  These are just hand-drawn.
[27:17.810 --> 27:19.750]  I mean, you could just blow right through all this shit.
[27:20.150 --> 27:20.850]  Yeah, right?
[27:21.670 --> 27:22.570]  The mask!
[27:22.610 --> 27:24.370]  The mask from The Mask?
[27:25.170 --> 27:26.090]  $60,000.
[27:26.130 --> 27:26.750]  $60,000.
[27:27.190 --> 27:27.490]  Fuck.
[27:28.590 --> 27:29.510]  Oh my God.
[27:30.350 --> 27:30.610]  Jeez.
[27:31.650 --> 27:32.110]  Wow.
[27:34.210 --> 27:35.610]  We could just have this.
[27:35.850 --> 27:36.390]  That's okay.
[27:36.450 --> 27:37.510]  Upper body miniature.
[27:38.330 --> 27:38.690]  Dude.
[27:39.210 --> 27:40.330]  Dolph Lundgren miniature.
[27:41.110 --> 27:42.150]  Did you guys see that movie?
[27:43.170 --> 27:44.750]  1987 Master of the Universe with Dolph Lundgren?
[27:45.050 --> 27:45.270]  It's good.
[27:45.330 --> 27:45.450]  Yeah.
[27:45.810 --> 27:46.090]  Oh yeah.
[27:46.410 --> 27:46.850]  I remember it.
[27:46.870 --> 27:48.750]  We might need a bodyguard for the studio space.
[27:48.850 --> 27:49.530]  We could get that.
[27:49.630 --> 27:50.510]  Just put that in front.
[27:50.770 --> 27:51.730]  Scare everybody away.
[27:52.290 --> 27:53.910]  People are going to go, I don't think so.
[27:55.190 --> 27:55.630]  What is it?
[27:55.650 --> 27:57.090]  He said, in our world, we don't say goodbye.
[27:57.170 --> 27:58.450]  We say, safe journey.
[28:00.170 --> 28:01.490]  Here you go, Matrix Reloaded.
[28:02.070 --> 28:04.490]  The bust from the Chateau.
[28:04.750 --> 28:04.950]  Yeah.
[28:05.330 --> 28:06.150]  The Merovingians.
[28:06.150 --> 28:07.350]  Now, is it actually?
[28:07.670 --> 28:10.270]  Like, are they going to show me, like, where it's from?
[28:10.270 --> 28:11.490]  Yeah, it's probably during the fight.
[28:13.370 --> 28:14.130]  Which is this?
[28:15.030 --> 28:16.210]  Oh, I guess that's it, huh?
[28:16.410 --> 28:16.710]  Wow.
[28:16.870 --> 28:17.490]  There it is.
[28:17.590 --> 28:18.390]  The twins are there.
[28:19.350 --> 28:19.750]  Wow.
[28:20.230 --> 28:20.530]  Okay.
[28:21.890 --> 28:22.490]  There it is.
[28:22.530 --> 28:23.470]  It's screaming and everything.
[28:24.630 --> 28:25.150]  How about that?
[28:25.430 --> 28:27.170]  I want the cake instead.
[28:27.550 --> 28:29.250]  Give me the cake from all that whole scene.
[28:29.390 --> 28:29.970]  I want a cake.
[28:30.250 --> 28:31.050]  Third best Matrix movie.
[28:32.290 --> 28:33.330]  The pocket note.
[28:34.990 --> 28:35.830]  That's cool.
[28:35.930 --> 28:36.690]  There you go.
[28:36.690 --> 28:37.290]  That's kind of cool.
[28:38.070 --> 28:38.830]  Men in Black.
[28:39.350 --> 28:40.870]  Oh, that seems like a very Andrew thing.
[28:41.710 --> 28:44.370]  Yeah, if I was 10, I'd be very excited about this.
[28:45.050 --> 28:45.370]  Dude.
[28:45.550 --> 28:47.170]  No, no, no.
[28:47.730 --> 28:48.770]  Mighty Joe Young.
[28:49.030 --> 28:49.590]  It's so scary.
[28:50.610 --> 28:51.930]  Don't you want that in your home?
[28:52.070 --> 28:53.450]  Looking at you all day, every day?
[28:54.790 --> 28:55.710]  Scroll fast.
[28:58.770 --> 28:59.390]  Mork and Mindy.
[28:59.810 --> 29:00.150]  Whoa.
[29:00.390 --> 29:01.550]  Oh, wow.
[29:01.770 --> 29:03.050]  It's screen matched, too.
[29:03.050 --> 29:04.890]  But it's also from The Outer Limits.
[29:07.090 --> 29:07.610]  What?
[29:07.810 --> 29:08.650]  They used two for...
[29:08.650 --> 29:10.550]  They used multiple props back then.
[29:10.750 --> 29:11.450]  They used to reuse...
[29:11.450 --> 29:15.210]  That's a robot that was in like Rocky and Columbo and...
[29:15.210 --> 29:15.630]  Oh, yeah.
[29:15.630 --> 29:18.130]  This is very specifically just me.
[29:18.290 --> 29:18.690]  The hat?
[29:18.870 --> 29:19.350]  The hermit's...
[29:19.350 --> 29:19.670]  Yes.
[29:19.930 --> 29:21.550]  Oh, no, I'm with you.
[29:21.650 --> 29:22.430]  I think this is awesome.
[29:22.570 --> 29:23.070]  I love that.
[29:23.070 --> 29:24.330]  That's fucking cool.
[29:24.630 --> 29:25.490]  That movie ruled.
[29:27.490 --> 29:28.210]  That was...
[29:28.210 --> 29:28.570]  Oh.
[29:28.930 --> 29:29.630]  Is this matched?
[29:29.770 --> 29:30.950]  It's not matched or anything.
[29:31.070 --> 29:32.050]  It's just...
[29:32.050 --> 29:32.270]  Who cares?
[29:32.270 --> 29:33.130]  Let's get it.
[29:34.690 --> 29:35.570]  Who cares?
[29:35.830 --> 29:36.850]  We have no connection to this.
[29:36.930 --> 29:38.010]  We haven't talked about it in anything.
[29:38.150 --> 29:38.510]  Who cares?
[29:38.550 --> 29:38.710]  What are you talking about?
[29:38.810 --> 29:39.510]  It's a frog hat.
[29:39.550 --> 29:40.210]  Get the frog hat.
[29:40.210 --> 29:40.750]  Nothing in content.
[29:40.990 --> 29:42.310]  Definitely had a lot of personal connections.
[29:43.330 --> 29:44.150]  Muppets Treasure Island.
[29:44.270 --> 29:44.650]  It was...
[29:44.650 --> 29:45.110]  Oh.
[29:45.230 --> 29:45.570]  Oh.
[29:45.850 --> 29:46.290]  Oh.
[29:47.530 --> 29:48.250]  Oh, he's cheap.
[29:48.590 --> 29:49.110]  He's cheap?
[29:49.110 --> 29:49.210]  Whoa.
[29:49.870 --> 29:51.270]  Wait, how is it only...
[29:51.270 --> 29:52.970]  How is it only five to ten?
[29:53.810 --> 29:54.250]  Ooh.
[29:55.550 --> 29:57.030]  It's screen matched.
[29:58.410 --> 29:58.850]  It's...
[29:58.850 --> 30:00.790]  We gotta get this for Geoff.
[30:00.790 --> 30:01.250]  Yeah.
[30:02.250 --> 30:02.650]  How...
[30:03.690 --> 30:04.890]  How is this not...
[30:05.990 --> 30:06.690]  More money.
[30:06.750 --> 30:08.510]  How is this not going for, like, way more?
[30:10.370 --> 30:11.170]  It's from...
[30:11.690 --> 30:12.910]  Is this from the movie?
[30:13.230 --> 30:13.810]  This is from the movie.
[30:13.810 --> 30:16.210]  Mystery Slider 3,000, the movie, was fucking great, by the way.
[30:17.290 --> 30:17.690]  I...
[30:17.690 --> 30:18.730]  That's crazy.
[30:20.610 --> 30:21.010]  Wow.
[30:21.430 --> 30:22.510]  I'm gonna keep this tab open.
[30:22.590 --> 30:24.250]  We should keep our eye on it.
[30:24.270 --> 30:27.030]  It's already got a $5,000 bid, so you know it's not gonna go low.
[30:27.030 --> 30:27.410]  That...
[30:27.410 --> 30:27.670]  Yeah.
[30:27.910 --> 30:29.450]  That would be...
[30:29.450 --> 30:31.710]  It's always a little nerve-wracking when someone else is interested.
[30:33.570 --> 30:34.010]  Like...
[30:34.010 --> 30:35.710]  That's crazy. It's just...
[30:35.710 --> 30:36.150]  It's Crow.
[30:36.530 --> 30:37.150]  Like, it's just...
[30:37.150 --> 30:40.630]  You would just own Crow from the movie.
[30:40.990 --> 30:42.330]  It is the fucking Crow T. Robot.
[30:42.810 --> 30:43.070]  It's Crow.
[30:43.250 --> 30:44.130]  It's just Crow.
[30:44.310 --> 30:45.650]  That's fucking nuts.
[30:46.030 --> 30:46.070]  Wow.
[30:46.870 --> 30:47.150]  Wow.
[30:47.150 --> 30:48.850]  Dude, can you imagine getting Crow and Tom Servo?
[30:48.950 --> 30:50.090]  And then you could just start fucking...
[30:50.090 --> 30:50.390]  You could...
[30:50.390 --> 30:50.770]  Oh, wow.
[30:50.850 --> 30:51.290]  Oh.
[30:51.590 --> 30:52.030]  Yes.
[30:52.670 --> 30:54.270]  Our watch-alongs...
[30:54.270 --> 30:56.010]  If we do watch-alongs, that's the...
[30:56.010 --> 30:56.850]  That's the video.
[30:57.030 --> 30:58.130]  There's one screen...
[30:58.130 --> 30:59.750]  And it's the back of Crow's head.
[30:59.870 --> 31:00.230]  Yep.
[31:00.470 --> 31:01.490]  Sitting in Geoff's office.
[31:01.510 --> 31:02.250]  I love that.
[31:02.310 --> 31:04.330]  Then we get sued and we go, no, that's our Crow.
[31:04.530 --> 31:05.170]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:05.270 --> 31:05.530]  That's...
[31:05.530 --> 31:05.770]  Oh, yeah.
[31:05.910 --> 31:06.950]  You don't understand.
[31:07.230 --> 31:08.070]  We have Crow.
[31:08.210 --> 31:08.810]  That's our Crow.
[31:08.950 --> 31:14.250]  We should have our version when we do watch-alongs that's like the giant red boots and it's like
[31:14.250 --> 31:15.330]  a silly straw...
[31:15.330 --> 31:16.310]  Like, one of the...
[31:16.310 --> 31:16.970]  Face silly straws.
[31:17.210 --> 31:19.610]  And it's just back silhouettes of some of our dumber merchandise.
[31:19.630 --> 31:20.650]  Our stupid...
[31:20.650 --> 31:21.830]  Silhouette of Ian.
[31:22.350 --> 31:22.750]  A gherkler.
[31:23.170 --> 31:23.910]  A gherkler.
[31:24.370 --> 31:25.130]  One of our falcons.
[31:25.510 --> 31:26.850]  I want to keep an eye on this one.
[31:26.850 --> 31:27.930]  I'm very into this.
[31:28.730 --> 31:29.110]  Yeah, I am too.
[31:29.110 --> 31:32.850]  This is the first one that we came across where I go, ooh, I really like want this.
[31:33.030 --> 31:33.990]  It made my...
[31:33.990 --> 31:35.510]  It made my dick tingle.
[31:35.770 --> 31:36.130]  This...
[31:36.130 --> 31:38.070]  It really says...
[31:39.170 --> 31:39.530]  Like...
[31:40.030 --> 31:41.870]  Is it made of like a baking tin?
[31:42.150 --> 31:42.710]  It is.
[31:42.710 --> 31:43.190]  It's Tupperware.
[31:43.590 --> 31:44.310]  It's Tupperware.
[31:45.090 --> 31:45.970]  That's all they were.
[31:46.150 --> 31:47.050]  It's fucking great.
[31:47.310 --> 31:48.010]  Oh, wow.
[31:48.870 --> 31:49.450]  That's so cool.
[31:49.450 --> 31:50.570]  It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[31:51.130 --> 31:51.570]  We could...
[31:51.570 --> 31:52.630]  I don't think we buy this.
[31:52.650 --> 31:53.950]  I think we just steal it.
[31:54.770 --> 31:55.890]  Why would you pay for that?
[31:55.890 --> 31:57.650]  Yeah, Nick Cage told us.
[31:57.730 --> 31:58.070]  Why would anybody pay for it?
[31:58.350 --> 31:58.490]  Yep.
[31:59.410 --> 32:00.030]  Oh, yeah.
[32:00.270 --> 32:01.250]  It's all New Nightmare.
[32:01.370 --> 32:01.650]  Pretty cool.
[32:01.950 --> 32:03.290]  Dream Warriors.
[32:04.390 --> 32:05.150]  Ugh, boy.
[32:06.390 --> 32:07.550]  Is Dream Warriors the good one?
[32:07.830 --> 32:08.130]  No.
[32:08.390 --> 32:08.670]  It's...
[32:08.670 --> 32:08.930]  No.
[32:09.330 --> 32:09.670]  No.
[32:09.890 --> 32:12.230]  I mean, like, there's that song, but that's really it.
[32:13.190 --> 32:13.950]  Yeah, it's one...
[32:14.710 --> 32:15.150]  There's...
[32:15.150 --> 32:16.470]  Dream Warriors are easy, I think, right?
[32:16.550 --> 32:17.450]  What's Outland?
[32:17.610 --> 32:17.790]  Yeah.
[32:17.910 --> 32:18.950]  I think Dream Warriors might be good.
[32:19.630 --> 32:20.190]  I don't know.
[32:20.190 --> 32:20.990]  Sean Connery.
[32:21.510 --> 32:21.750]  Yeah.
[32:22.030 --> 32:23.750]  And John Ratzenberger.
[32:26.210 --> 32:27.150]  Weird movie.
[32:27.730 --> 32:28.910]  Ah, my favorite.
[32:29.030 --> 32:29.370]  Papillion.
[32:29.670 --> 32:30.650]  General Patton's stick.
[32:31.670 --> 32:32.030]  Great.
[32:32.970 --> 32:34.430]  It's his swagger stick.
[32:34.750 --> 32:37.570]  Oh, the Pink Panther's frickin' suit!
[32:38.110 --> 32:38.650]  That's great.
[32:38.870 --> 32:40.250]  Oh, it's screen matched?
[32:40.630 --> 32:41.130]  Hang on.
[32:41.310 --> 32:41.730]  We're on display.
[32:42.630 --> 32:42.970]  Wow.
[32:43.650 --> 32:45.230]  Not pricey, either.
[32:45.590 --> 32:45.970]  Wow.
[32:45.990 --> 32:46.230]  No.
[32:46.650 --> 32:46.730]  Okay.
[32:47.510 --> 32:47.910]  That's another...
[32:47.910 --> 32:48.890]  And you want to talk about...
[32:48.890 --> 32:53.730]  You want to talk about having something that would scare off intruders soon enough.
[32:53.730 --> 32:56.530]  Like a suit of armor with Crotee Robot's head.
[32:56.930 --> 32:57.830]  Stick it right out of it.
[32:58.670 --> 32:59.910]  Crotee Nelson is funny, too.
[33:00.110 --> 33:00.810]  Yeah, Crotee...
[33:00.810 --> 33:03.790]  This is our crow, it's Crotee Nelson.
[33:04.170 --> 33:07.670]  I would much rather see Gavin in that than the Ace Ventura thing.
[33:07.690 --> 33:08.330]  Yes, me too.
[33:08.330 --> 33:08.510]  Oh, yeah.
[33:08.610 --> 33:09.670]  I would love that.
[33:09.930 --> 33:10.510]  Yeah, same.
[33:10.890 --> 33:17.410]  And I think that's the movie where Peter Sellers was so drunk and messed up that he couldn't
[33:17.410 --> 33:18.130]  even do...
[33:18.130 --> 33:20.750]  They had to get stuntmen to have him walking into a shot.
[33:20.970 --> 33:21.690]  Oh, my God.
[33:21.690 --> 33:24.670]  Also, Gavin is more...
[33:24.670 --> 33:27.570]  He may want to be an Ace Ventura, but he's definitely...
[33:27.570 --> 33:29.290]  Oh, he's way more Clouseau.
[33:29.430 --> 33:30.770]  He's way more of a Clouseau.
[33:31.030 --> 33:32.730]  All right, we're keeping this one open also.
[33:32.810 --> 33:33.550]  We got three so far.
[33:33.570 --> 33:34.430]  I'm feeling good about it.
[33:34.650 --> 33:35.370]  Pirates of the Caribbean.
[33:35.690 --> 33:36.630]  Planet of the Apes.
[33:36.690 --> 33:38.150]  Oh, like original Planet of the Apes.
[33:38.310 --> 33:38.670]  Dang.
[33:39.550 --> 33:40.170]  That's pretty cool.
[33:40.790 --> 33:41.230]  Poltergeist.
[33:41.310 --> 33:42.270]  Why would you want that?
[33:43.030 --> 33:43.470]  Predators.
[33:44.630 --> 33:45.030]  No.
[33:45.890 --> 33:48.650]  I like Predators, but I wouldn't want that.
[33:49.230 --> 33:49.390]  Yeah.
[33:49.830 --> 33:50.030]  Yeah.
[33:50.030 --> 33:51.050]  This is...
[33:51.050 --> 33:51.930]  It's a fun action movie.
[33:52.970 --> 33:54.230]  Screen match book.
[33:54.750 --> 34:00.710]  That screen match clown doll is one of the three scariest things of my entire childhood.
[34:01.150 --> 34:02.130]  Click on that right now.
[34:02.790 --> 34:03.650]  You're crazy.
[34:04.150 --> 34:05.910]  There's a fucking scene in that...
[34:06.890 --> 34:07.750]  Oh, yeah.
[34:07.770 --> 34:08.630]  Oh, yeah.
[34:08.990 --> 34:09.450]  Oh, God.
[34:09.450 --> 34:12.870]  That is the scariest part of the whole fucking movie, that clown.
[34:13.150 --> 34:14.550]  Jesus H. Christ.
[34:15.310 --> 34:15.870]  Nightmare.
[34:16.150 --> 34:19.850]  That clown, that prop is responsible for so many fucking nightmares in my childhood.
[34:19.850 --> 34:20.590]  Let's get it.
[34:20.810 --> 34:21.910]  Let's face your fears.
[34:24.010 --> 34:24.890]  Have a look, Geoff.
[34:25.510 --> 34:26.050]  There he is.
[34:26.170 --> 34:26.870]  Oh, God.
[34:27.210 --> 34:27.490]  No.
[34:27.710 --> 34:27.830]  No.
[34:30.590 --> 34:31.550]  I hate him.
[34:33.430 --> 34:33.570]  Oh.
[34:33.990 --> 34:34.650]  Pulp Fiction.
[34:35.250 --> 34:35.390]  The...
[34:36.250 --> 34:37.010]  That's really neat.
[34:37.450 --> 34:37.890]  Pretty Woman.
[34:40.130 --> 34:41.890]  Robin Hood Men in Tights.
[34:42.010 --> 34:42.690]  Oh, I love that movie.
[34:43.150 --> 34:43.990]  Oh, Prince of Thieves.
[34:44.950 --> 34:46.470]  Oh, that's worse.
[34:46.970 --> 34:47.770]  What are you talking about?
[34:47.850 --> 34:48.650]  That led to...
[34:48.650 --> 34:49.230]  The Rock.
[34:50.750 --> 34:51.110]  Oh.
[34:52.270 --> 34:54.450]  Dude, that was in our Villain Deaths, that thing.
[34:54.710 --> 34:55.390]  It was.
[34:56.010 --> 34:57.190]  That would be cool to have.
[34:58.570 --> 34:59.670]  It's the canister.
[34:59.990 --> 35:01.750]  Is it screen matched or anything, or is it just...
[35:01.750 --> 35:05.770]  We just have to make sure to keep that really nice, because, heaven forbid, we spill it.
[35:06.330 --> 35:10.230]  Well, that's why we put it at the front of the studio space, to scare off anyone who might come in.
[35:10.310 --> 35:11.710]  What if they knock it over and they die?
[35:14.200 --> 35:14.560]  Wow.
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.300]  These are broken.
[35:17.000 --> 35:17.340]  Uh-oh.
[35:17.960 --> 35:18.540]  Uh-oh.
[35:18.540 --> 35:20.560]  How are they getting close enough to take pictures?
[35:24.080 --> 35:25.800]  Inset with 50 pearls.
[35:26.640 --> 35:28.480]  Mounted via plastic rows of 10.
[35:30.340 --> 35:30.780]  Huh.
[35:31.900 --> 35:33.740]  Undergone partial sympathetic restoration.
[35:34.380 --> 35:36.500]  You just broke my fucking brain, Eric.
[35:36.840 --> 35:42.440]  I was just looking at those pictures and reading, and I wasn't paying attention, and I went to scroll down as if it was my screen.
[35:42.860 --> 35:44.460]  At the exact second you scrolled down.
[35:44.460 --> 35:44.960]  Oh, really?
[35:44.960 --> 35:49.740]  And when it scrolled down, I stopped for a second, and then I did it again, and then you did it again.
[35:49.840 --> 35:55.000]  So it was two broken scrolls, and it just fucking... just really confused the shit out of me for a second.
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.280]  Can I tell you that that's how I thought I was driving the car in, uh...
[36:01.500 --> 36:02.300]  That's pretty good.
[36:02.340 --> 36:03.100]  Which we're doing later.
[36:03.620 --> 36:03.820]  Yep.
[36:04.020 --> 36:04.560]  Oh, man.
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.160]  Rollerball, Running Man, Saturday Night Fever.
[36:09.420 --> 36:10.540]  Scary Movie 2.
[36:10.980 --> 36:11.540]  Oh, wow.
[36:11.540 --> 36:15.380]  I don't remember there being a Poltergeist from 2015.
[36:17.220 --> 36:19.220]  I think Sam Rockwell was in it.
[36:19.740 --> 36:20.040]  Wow.
[36:20.280 --> 36:21.420]  Oh, Brad Pitt's leather jacket.
[36:22.020 --> 36:25.220]  It's a seven, and...
[36:25.220 --> 36:25.840]  Ooh, The Shining.
[36:25.860 --> 36:27.600]  A lot of Shawshank stuff. The Shining.
[36:28.280 --> 36:28.720]  Bernie Burns.
[36:28.720 --> 36:30.100]  Screen matched in everything.
[36:30.340 --> 36:30.840]  That's pretty cool.
[36:30.940 --> 36:31.000]  Wow.
[36:31.680 --> 36:32.220]  That is cool.
[36:33.000 --> 36:33.860]  Short Circuit 2, Geoff.
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.340]  Oh, Johnny!
[36:36.180 --> 36:37.560]  Uh, Smoky and the Bandit 2.
[36:37.880 --> 36:38.360]  Oh, man.
[36:38.400 --> 36:38.880]  Ooh, Spawn.
[36:40.740 --> 36:41.180]  Spawn.
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.440]  Oh, the bike! Peter Parker's bike.
[36:45.760 --> 36:46.100]  Yep.
[36:47.080 --> 36:48.120]  Delivering those pizzas.
[36:50.840 --> 36:52.400]  A lot of silent running stuff.
[36:52.680 --> 36:54.100]  Don't know what silent running is.
[36:54.180 --> 36:57.360]  Yeah, zero attachment or real knowledge of what that is.
[36:57.520 --> 36:59.200]  A lot of silent running stuff.
[36:59.380 --> 37:00.980]  Alright, we're on page 3 of 20.
[37:02.100 --> 37:05.060]  Well, we're gonna skip many Star Trek pages, right?
[37:05.620 --> 37:06.300]  Oh, that's right.
[37:07.240 --> 37:07.960]  Uh, 2001.
[37:08.540 --> 37:08.780]  Wow.
[37:09.640 --> 37:12.020]  A lot of 2001 pictures.
[37:12.100 --> 37:12.640]  We'll skip all that.
[37:13.180 --> 37:14.800]  Back to the Future of the Ride?!
[37:14.800 --> 37:15.060]  What?
[37:15.460 --> 37:16.880]  No, Jack just got a boner.
[37:17.380 --> 37:17.560]  Yeah.
[37:18.080 --> 37:18.720]  No kidding.
[37:19.940 --> 37:21.760]  Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Brainstorm.
[37:21.980 --> 37:23.980]  Dude, that's a fucking phenomenal film.
[37:24.520 --> 37:27.220]  I feel like it doesn't get remembered enough.
[37:27.480 --> 37:28.040]  Close Encounters?
[37:28.320 --> 37:28.640]  Yeah.
[37:29.280 --> 37:29.420]  Oh.
[37:29.780 --> 37:31.160]  It's almost a perfect movie.
[37:31.440 --> 37:32.500]  Oh, it's so good.
[37:32.960 --> 37:34.960]  Uh, Star Trek, Star Trek, Star Trek.
[37:35.160 --> 37:35.440]  Uh-oh.
[37:35.860 --> 37:36.200]  Uh-oh.
[37:36.200 --> 37:38.880]  So the rest of page 4 is Star Trek going into Star Wars.
[37:39.880 --> 37:40.940]  Ooh, Star Wars, you say?
[37:40.980 --> 37:42.160]  What do they have for the Star War?
[37:42.580 --> 37:43.440]  That's what I'm trying to find.
[37:43.500 --> 37:44.200]  Here we go, here we go.
[37:44.940 --> 37:45.560]  Alright, here we go.
[37:45.560 --> 37:46.040]  Alright, here we go.
[37:46.060 --> 37:46.440]  Found it.
[37:48.720 --> 37:49.360]  Phantom Menace.
[37:50.600 --> 37:50.920]  Replica.
[37:50.940 --> 37:51.980]  That's all I can think of, honestly.
[37:53.860 --> 37:54.980]  Production-made Blade.
[37:57.840 --> 38:01.380]  I think the thing with those lightsabers, though, is there were so many of them.
[38:02.060 --> 38:02.320]  Kit Fisto.
[38:02.940 --> 38:04.760]  These are Kit Fisto's tendrils.
[38:04.760 --> 38:06.920]  These are Kit Fisto's tendrils!
[38:08.200 --> 38:09.300]  Kit Fisto!
[38:09.640 --> 38:10.540]  You keep saying that.
[38:11.300 --> 38:12.760]  Kit Fisto tendrils!
[38:13.100 --> 38:14.640]  The tendrils from Kit.
[38:14.740 --> 38:19.440]  Guys, I know we're always talking about Kit Fisto and all of our favorite Kit Fisto moments.
[38:19.800 --> 38:25.420]  I wonder how much of the actor's face skin is on the ends of those from turning them.
[38:28.040 --> 38:29.160]  A comm link.
[38:30.540 --> 38:32.600]  This is like the worst stuff.
[38:33.720 --> 38:39.460]  Oh, I would not be mad at getting Pandababa's gun, dude.
[38:39.540 --> 38:40.580]  That's fucking cool.
[38:41.120 --> 38:41.760]  $40,000.
[38:41.900 --> 38:42.720]  You'd be mad at the price.
[38:42.940 --> 38:44.780]  He's the walrus man.
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.420]  My friend doesn't like you either.
[38:50.660 --> 38:50.920]  This guy.
[38:52.540 --> 38:52.980]  Yep.
[38:53.540 --> 38:54.780]  Gonna lose his...
[38:54.780 --> 38:56.220]  About to lose his fucking arm.
[38:56.300 --> 38:56.880]  There it is!
[38:57.600 --> 38:58.280]  Lost his arm!
[38:58.700 --> 39:00.260]  It's just on the floor in his hand.
[39:00.280 --> 39:00.880]  That's so cool.
[39:00.880 --> 39:01.660]  That's great.
[39:03.100 --> 39:04.320]  $40,000 to $80,000.
[39:04.420 --> 39:04.840]  That's nuts.
[39:06.020 --> 39:06.280]  Alright.
[39:06.960 --> 39:07.400]  $5,000.
[39:07.800 --> 39:08.680]  Let's keep it going.
[39:10.100 --> 39:10.540]  Wow!
[39:11.440 --> 39:12.320]  Holy dick.
[39:13.120 --> 39:14.620]  That's a promotional costume?
[39:15.020 --> 39:15.360]  I don't know.
[39:15.480 --> 39:16.500]  This stuff's crazy.
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.460]  Astromech droid head?
[39:18.900 --> 39:19.740]  It lights up, Eric!
[39:21.360 --> 39:23.860]  This is all stuff that I would've seen at Tommy Tallarico's house.
[39:24.000 --> 39:25.200]  Binders of story.
[39:25.220 --> 39:25.780]  That is...
[39:25.780 --> 39:27.280]  That is such a...
[39:27.280 --> 39:28.040]  That is so funny.
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.120]  He had like an Egypt room.
[39:29.300 --> 39:29.920]  It was...
[39:29.920 --> 39:32.580]  A lot of Return of the Jedi.
[39:32.740 --> 39:34.100]  It's an Ewok rock.
[39:34.620 --> 39:35.020]  Ewok.
[39:35.880 --> 39:36.170]  Ewok!
[39:39.060 --> 39:40.900]  Star Wars Panasonic commercial?
[39:41.560 --> 39:42.160]  I don't know.
[39:44.180 --> 39:47.240]  Holiday special animation cell.
[39:47.460 --> 39:48.520]  That's really good.
[39:49.780 --> 39:50.860]  Hey, happy birthday, Blaine.
[39:52.260 --> 39:53.340]  Yeah, no kidding.
[39:53.640 --> 39:54.980]  It's exactly what this stuff is.
[39:55.580 --> 39:56.930]  Light up remote control R2D2s.
[39:57.620 --> 39:57.880]  Yeah.
[40:00.100 --> 40:00.820]  Stargate.
[40:02.940 --> 40:04.240]  Ninja Turtles!
[40:05.580 --> 40:06.300]  Superman.
[40:07.800 --> 40:09.620]  This is from the original.
[40:10.380 --> 40:11.800]  The Fortress of Solitude Crystal.
[40:12.120 --> 40:14.280]  It's like Krypton DVDs.
[40:14.740 --> 40:16.220]  It's a Raphael head!
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.960]  Screen-matched animatronic.
[40:20.040 --> 40:21.220]  Only $10,000 to $20,000, man.
[40:21.260 --> 40:23.300]  Wow, the actual Ten Commandments.
[40:23.340 --> 40:23.820]  Ten Commandments.
[40:26.000 --> 40:27.580]  Dude, Terminator 2.
[40:28.160 --> 40:28.720]  Look at this.
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.740]  T-1000's arm.
[40:31.880 --> 40:32.700]  Glitch arm.
[40:33.060 --> 40:34.660]  It says that it's a glitch arm.
[40:34.760 --> 40:35.400]  What does that mean?
[40:35.460 --> 40:36.840]  It's when he was glitching out.
[40:39.080 --> 40:40.520]  He couldn't control himself.
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.920]  That's cool that was practical.
[40:43.520 --> 40:44.900]  Wow, that is cool.
[40:46.220 --> 40:47.640]  Oh, that's where he cuts his arm off.
[40:48.300 --> 40:50.000]  It's just the skin, too.
[40:51.220 --> 40:52.500]  Dude, arm skin.
[40:53.580 --> 40:54.700]  There's his chest.
[40:55.440 --> 40:56.700]  It's a big fucking launcher.
[40:56.700 --> 40:57.540]  Grenade launcher.
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.420]  Oh, shit.
[40:58.660 --> 40:59.380]  Oh, the head.
[40:59.500 --> 41:00.420]  It's fucked up.
[41:00.700 --> 41:01.740]  Oh my god.
[41:02.180 --> 41:02.820]  Crew gift.
[41:04.180 --> 41:05.180]  Statue display.
[41:05.360 --> 41:06.280]  Terminator costume.
[41:07.640 --> 41:08.780]  Oh, here we go.
[41:08.900 --> 41:09.720]  Terminator Salvation.
[41:09.720 --> 41:10.240]  Everyone's favorite.
[41:10.700 --> 41:11.020]  Yeah.
[41:11.300 --> 41:12.720]  Texas Chainsaw.
[41:13.100 --> 41:13.660]  3D.
[41:14.900 --> 41:17.720]  Oh, three suitors meet Hercules.
[41:19.060 --> 41:22.940]  Do you think that's the outfit that Christian Bale was wearing when he was yelling at everyone?
[41:23.620 --> 41:24.180]  Yeah.
[41:24.180 --> 41:28.360]  Oh, what don't you fucking understand?
[41:29.560 --> 41:33.160]  I didn't realize how much Christian Bale and Eric sound alike.
[41:34.240 --> 41:35.920]  You kind of nailed it.
[41:36.120 --> 41:36.940]  Thanks for you.
[41:36.940 --> 41:37.500]  Good night, Tro.
[41:40.120 --> 41:41.400]  Titanic stuff?
[41:41.500 --> 41:42.920]  Look at how goddamn expensive.
[41:43.600 --> 41:43.980]  Wow.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.360]  Good grief.
[41:46.340 --> 41:46.780]  Wow.
[41:48.620 --> 41:49.260]  Tombstone!
[41:49.420 --> 41:50.220]  Kurt Russell's hat!
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.620]  Dude, if that was actually...
[41:53.620 --> 41:57.660]  If Nick had to wear that mask, I don't think he'd pull it off.
[41:57.920 --> 41:58.320]  Sneakily.
[41:58.920 --> 42:01.320]  I think we'd figure it out.
[42:02.120 --> 42:02.560]  Where's home?
[42:03.360 --> 42:04.580]  Geoff, Geoff, Geoff!
[42:04.920 --> 42:05.320]  Geoff!
[42:05.560 --> 42:06.380]  Troop Beverly Hills!
[42:06.780 --> 42:08.340]  Dude, Troop Beverly Hills is fucking awesome.
[42:08.520 --> 42:09.420]  Oh, my wife loves it.
[42:09.500 --> 42:10.740]  Oh, Steve Coogan's head!
[42:13.580 --> 42:14.900]  We've gotta get that.
[42:18.020 --> 42:21.120]  24 grand for a head that doesn't look like Steve Coogan.
[42:21.140 --> 42:21.540]  Not at all!
[42:23.680 --> 42:25.880]  God, that movie's so good.
[42:28.220 --> 42:29.440]  That's so funny.
[42:30.560 --> 42:31.660]  Oh, look!
[42:31.660 --> 42:32.160]  Unbreakable!
[42:33.120 --> 42:33.800]  Unbreakable!
[42:35.300 --> 42:35.980]  Unforgiven?
[42:36.240 --> 42:36.460]  Fuck.
[42:36.960 --> 42:37.560]  That's a good movie.
[42:37.840 --> 42:38.420]  Great movie.
[42:38.640 --> 42:40.140]  V from the original V.
[42:42.140 --> 42:43.500]  Van Helsing!
[42:45.360 --> 42:46.040]  Oh, guys.
[42:46.700 --> 42:47.920]  Guys, Warcraft.
[42:48.740 --> 42:49.700]  Oh, Wayne's World.
[42:49.940 --> 42:50.600]  Wayne's World?
[42:51.280 --> 42:52.580]  That's not bad.
[42:52.580 --> 42:53.900]  White Man Can't Jump Shoes!
[42:53.920 --> 42:54.020]  Wayne's World hat.
[42:54.160 --> 42:56.940]  Oh, it's a production-made Wayne's World hat.
[42:58.420 --> 43:00.400]  I like White Man Can't Jump.
[43:00.460 --> 43:01.320]  I love that movie.
[43:01.400 --> 43:02.280]  Wesley Snipes' sneakers.
[43:02.280 --> 43:03.700]  Judge Doom's cane!
[43:04.220 --> 43:04.660]  Holy shit!
[43:04.680 --> 43:07.200]  Wesley Snipes' distressed tank top.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.480]  That's only $2,000.
[43:09.620 --> 43:10.460]  We could do that.
[43:11.620 --> 43:14.960]  Yeah, we could afford $1,000 for a Wesley Snipes tank top.
[43:16.160 --> 43:18.220]  Wild Bunch Photo Match Chairs?
[43:18.480 --> 43:18.920]  Wow.
[43:20.780 --> 43:21.820]  Ooh, the golden lasso.
[43:21.820 --> 43:23.780]  Oh, my God.
[43:23.840 --> 43:24.260]  The claws!
[43:24.920 --> 43:26.240]  Geoff could pop some claws.
[43:26.540 --> 43:29.680]  Geoff, you could be popping claws today.
[43:30.160 --> 43:31.220]  Geoff, it's time to pop off.
[43:31.660 --> 43:33.740]  I wouldn't mind popping a couple claws.
[43:34.160 --> 43:35.380]  I'm not gonna lie to y'all.
[43:35.980 --> 43:36.480]  Oh, dang.
[43:36.980 --> 43:37.760]  $12,000 seems like a lot.
[43:37.840 --> 43:38.320]  Oh, Logan!
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.100]  Oh, even more.
[43:39.340 --> 43:40.020]  Oh, from Logan.
[43:40.520 --> 43:40.760]  Ooh.
[43:41.440 --> 43:42.560]  We could find some...
[43:42.560 --> 43:44.800]  Maybe I could wear Madeline Stowe's dress from 12 Monkeys.
[43:47.780 --> 43:50.620]  Oh, the thing I remember the most from 12 Monkeys.
[43:50.620 --> 43:51.220]  Absolutely.
[43:51.700 --> 43:55.780]  The only thing I remember about that movie is that Brad Pitt had a mustache.
[43:56.100 --> 43:58.640]  Yeah, he had a lazy eye and a weird look.
[43:59.460 --> 44:01.180]  That's Jack Power's pistol.
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.340]  That is Jack Power's compact pistol.
[44:05.040 --> 44:06.120]  Jack Power, 24.
[44:08.670 --> 44:10.230]  International man of 24.
[44:10.410 --> 44:10.750]  Yeah.
[44:14.850 --> 44:16.050]  47 Ronin.
[44:16.570 --> 44:16.850]  Oh.
[44:18.770 --> 44:19.850]  48 hours, Geoff.
[44:21.270 --> 44:22.550]  Eddie Murphy's suit.
[44:23.350 --> 44:23.810]  That's not bad.
[44:23.890 --> 44:24.330]  $1,000.
[44:24.850 --> 44:26.670]  Yeah, that's just like buying a new suit.
[44:29.270 --> 44:31.350]  Except Eddie Murphy also had it.
[44:31.670 --> 44:32.310]  Alright, alright.
[44:32.570 --> 44:34.550]  Ace Ventura with nature calls.
[44:36.010 --> 44:36.810]  That's cheap.
[44:37.150 --> 44:38.190]  Screen matched.
[44:38.730 --> 44:39.470]  That's cheap.
[44:39.650 --> 44:40.970]  Seems a little...
[44:42.010 --> 44:42.690]  Yes.
[44:43.410 --> 44:44.090]  Problematic.
[44:45.290 --> 44:45.670]  Yeah.
[44:46.410 --> 44:46.810]  Yeah.
[44:47.490 --> 44:47.750]  Yeah.
[44:48.230 --> 44:48.570]  Yeah.
[44:48.570 --> 44:52.570]  I mean, maybe you don't wear it so much, but...
[44:56.290 --> 44:58.850]  It is an interesting piece of film ephemera.
[44:59.030 --> 44:59.570]  I'll keep it open.
[44:59.710 --> 45:00.330]  I'll keep it open.
[45:02.050 --> 45:04.110]  Maybe what, puppet?
[45:06.030 --> 45:06.330]  What?
[45:07.130 --> 45:08.470]  What the fuck?
[45:08.950 --> 45:09.750]  Air Force One.
[45:10.010 --> 45:10.810]  Yeah, good movie.
[45:12.030 --> 45:13.770]  Oh, the nuclear football handcuffs.
[45:13.830 --> 45:15.210]  Is it Robin Williams?
[45:16.450 --> 45:17.350]  Is this? Hang on.
[45:17.350 --> 45:19.810]  Is this screen matched or anything, or it's just this stuff?
[45:20.370 --> 45:20.790]  Okay, bummer.
[45:20.830 --> 45:21.630]  It doesn't say it is.
[45:22.070 --> 45:22.930]  Nuh-uh, bummer.
[45:23.290 --> 45:23.990]  I wanted to see it.
[45:24.650 --> 45:24.850]  Yeah.
[45:25.190 --> 45:25.470]  Okay.
[45:25.570 --> 45:25.910]  It's a good movie.
[45:26.310 --> 45:28.110]  What were you saying about...
[45:28.110 --> 45:30.230]  I just didn't realize that was supposed to be Robin Williams.
[45:31.130 --> 45:32.170]  That caught me off guard.
[45:32.550 --> 45:33.230]  It is?
[45:34.350 --> 45:35.810]  Well, it says in the descriptor.
[45:36.290 --> 45:36.870]  It does.
[45:36.970 --> 45:37.690]  Sure looks like it.
[45:37.910 --> 45:38.030]  Yeah.
[45:38.850 --> 45:39.790]  Looks like Steve Coogan.
[45:40.550 --> 45:40.630]  Yeah.
[45:45.290 --> 45:45.710]  Ooh.
[45:46.510 --> 45:46.910]  Oh.
[45:48.850 --> 45:49.690]  Nostromo tips.
[45:50.070 --> 45:50.250]  Yeah.
[45:51.070 --> 45:52.110]  Don't touch the tips.
[45:53.570 --> 45:57.630]  First draft printed storyboard artwork portfolio and production schedule.
[45:58.810 --> 45:59.990]  Oh, look at the old call sheets.
[46:00.050 --> 46:00.650]  It's pretty cool.
[46:01.550 --> 46:02.090]  I think it's interesting.
[46:02.230 --> 46:02.850]  That would be, yeah.
[46:04.510 --> 46:04.930]  Vents.
[46:05.530 --> 46:09.190]  You think we could sell some of our old call sheets?
[46:09.410 --> 46:10.370]  Yeah, just to fund this.
[46:10.370 --> 46:11.370]  Add sheets, yeah.
[46:11.490 --> 46:12.770]  Just a bunch of alien hands.
[46:13.330 --> 46:13.450]  Yeah.
[46:13.490 --> 46:14.590]  Oh, it's like from the Queen.
[46:15.010 --> 46:15.510]  That's cool.
[46:15.810 --> 46:16.150]  Oh.
[46:19.480 --> 46:20.700]  Oh, that jacket's cool.
[46:21.500 --> 46:22.400]  Bug stomper crew.
[46:24.160 --> 46:25.280]  This is a lot...
[46:25.280 --> 46:25.740]  Here's pants.
[46:26.380 --> 46:28.180]  I'm gonna buy these pants and that suit.
[46:28.380 --> 46:29.000]  I'm gonna have a full...
[46:29.000 --> 46:29.720]  I'm gonna have a good outfit.
[46:30.080 --> 46:32.040]  I refuse us buying pants.
[46:32.200 --> 46:32.620]  Let's get the egg.
[46:32.620 --> 46:33.300]  It's not allowed.
[46:33.500 --> 46:34.240]  The egg, the egg.
[46:35.880 --> 46:37.420]  From Alien Resurrection?
[46:37.700 --> 46:38.080]  Never mind.
[46:38.160 --> 46:38.520]  Keep going.
[46:39.440 --> 46:42.660]  Isn't that the movie, Nick, that you said was perfect on paper?
[46:44.900 --> 46:45.300]  No.
[46:47.180 --> 46:48.020]  That was three.
[46:48.880 --> 46:49.700]  That's pretty neat.
[46:50.120 --> 46:51.320]  How do we get back to A?
[46:52.160 --> 46:52.420]  Don't know.
[46:52.700 --> 46:54.840]  Maybe it's a different lot or something?
[46:55.440 --> 46:56.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[46:57.440 --> 46:58.480]  And it's in the outfield.
[46:59.940 --> 47:02.280]  That just came to streaming for the first time for some reason.
[47:02.560 --> 47:04.040]  If you get that, you get the baby too.
[47:04.880 --> 47:06.340]  Apocalypse Now and Apollo 13.
[47:07.940 --> 47:08.340]  Like...
[47:08.340 --> 47:10.920]  Did you get Apocalypse Now script?
[47:11.460 --> 47:12.780]  Bound draft script for $400.
[47:13.120 --> 47:13.620]  That's not bad.
[47:13.780 --> 47:14.660]  Not bad at all.
[47:17.300 --> 47:18.260]  The Arrowverse.
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.080]  Awesome.
[47:19.400 --> 47:20.340]  Things to do before I die.
[47:21.300 --> 47:22.560]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[47:23.040 --> 47:24.340]  That seems like a cool thing.
[47:25.040 --> 47:25.380]  Nah.
[47:26.600 --> 47:27.260]  Let's see.
[47:27.720 --> 47:28.640]  I'm not a necklace guy.
[47:29.800 --> 47:30.480]  I think you're about to be.
[47:30.600 --> 47:31.000]  You could start.
[47:31.440 --> 47:32.660]  That's what he says to his teams.
[47:33.320 --> 47:33.880]  It's his necklace.
[47:34.600 --> 47:35.080]  Damn.
[47:36.520 --> 47:37.060]  Pretty good.
[47:37.060 --> 47:38.040]  That's funny.
[47:39.420 --> 47:40.340]  Babylon 5.
[47:40.600 --> 47:42.680]  Don't give a fuck about Babylon 5.
[47:42.800 --> 47:43.020]  No.
[47:43.160 --> 47:43.980]  A lot of this stuff.
[47:44.060 --> 47:44.460]  We're getting...
[47:44.460 --> 47:45.860]  It's getting thin on like the...
[47:45.860 --> 47:47.600]  Like, we're back around to bees now.
[47:47.620 --> 47:47.800]  Ooh la la.
[47:47.800 --> 47:48.980]  How does this...
[47:48.980 --> 47:50.400]  We're getting the sports almanacs again.
[47:50.460 --> 47:51.060]  We're back at the same shit.
[47:51.200 --> 47:51.460]  Yeah, right?
[47:51.800 --> 47:52.760]  Back to the future money.
[47:53.980 --> 47:55.060]  Ooh, bad boys.
[47:55.320 --> 47:55.720]  Coming up.
[47:56.360 --> 47:56.680]  Okay.
[47:56.960 --> 47:58.520]  Autographed hoverboard replica.
[48:00.220 --> 48:01.040]  Back draft.
[48:01.620 --> 48:02.080]  No.
[48:02.700 --> 48:04.720]  Oh, Larger Than Life, the music video.
[48:04.780 --> 48:05.240]  Wow.
[48:05.920 --> 48:07.020]  That's pretty cool.
[48:07.040 --> 48:08.200]  That's pretty cool.
[48:08.680 --> 48:09.620]  Bad boys.
[48:09.820 --> 48:11.080]  Now, that's...
[48:11.080 --> 48:11.860]  And Blade 2.
[48:12.300 --> 48:12.500]  Damn.
[48:12.780 --> 48:17.180]  Martin Lawrence's tactical police vest is only $1,500 from Batman.
[48:17.180 --> 48:17.880]  What is...
[48:17.880 --> 48:18.680]  What is steel?
[48:19.060 --> 48:20.060]  What is steel, guys?
[48:23.340 --> 48:24.500]  Basic instinct.
[48:24.880 --> 48:25.380]  Ooh, it needs ice picks.
[48:25.380 --> 48:26.020]  The ice picks.
[48:26.180 --> 48:26.360]  Yeah.
[48:26.520 --> 48:27.560]  Oh, no.
[48:28.060 --> 48:28.760]  Oh, no.
[48:28.760 --> 48:30.320]  Did they have to cut him out?
[48:30.740 --> 48:31.380]  Poor Batman.
[48:33.020 --> 48:33.320]  Batman.
[48:33.320 --> 48:33.600]  Poor Batman.
[48:36.320 --> 48:38.800]  Anybody want Michael Keaton's crotch?
[48:41.900 --> 48:42.680]  Batman's back.
[48:42.740 --> 48:43.260]  His return.
[48:43.420 --> 48:44.120]  And he looks sad.
[48:44.380 --> 48:45.520]  Oh, his pointy little ears.
[48:45.660 --> 48:46.840]  These are all beat to shit.
[48:47.100 --> 48:48.800]  I really love Haggard latex.
[48:49.100 --> 48:49.600]  So funny.
[48:51.020 --> 48:52.560]  Haggard latex would be a good band name.
[48:54.700 --> 48:57.260]  Dude, you could get the production-made Two-Face suit.
[48:57.460 --> 48:58.180]  That's pretty cool.
[48:58.480 --> 48:58.760]  Wow.
[48:58.960 --> 49:00.040]  That is really cool.
[49:01.800 --> 49:02.900]  I want to see Gavin in that.
[49:02.900 --> 49:03.880]  This is...
[49:03.880 --> 49:04.480]  Man.
[49:05.060 --> 49:07.720]  Why was Batman's license plate BW?
[49:08.620 --> 49:09.500]  Oh, because it's his name?
[49:13.060 --> 49:14.340]  I mean, it's his first name.
[49:14.500 --> 49:15.100]  It doesn't matter.
[49:15.480 --> 49:16.660]  I was like, what's Bat-Wan?
[49:18.780 --> 49:20.380]  I was imagining it on the Batmobile.
[49:21.100 --> 49:22.020]  Oh, my God.
[49:22.200 --> 49:24.560]  What if he mixed up the plates and put them on the wrong car?
[49:24.840 --> 49:25.960]  Oh, I gave it away.
[49:26.600 --> 49:27.080]  What?
[49:31.840 --> 49:32.320]  Batman.
[49:32.880 --> 49:33.520]  The Batman.
[49:35.280 --> 49:35.760]  Dude.
[49:37.120 --> 49:38.460]  Battlestar Galactica again?
[49:38.800 --> 49:39.040]  Oh, my God.
[49:39.040 --> 49:40.040]  Never got into Battlestar.
[49:40.360 --> 49:41.200]  No, never.
[49:41.320 --> 49:42.120]  Never seen a second of it.
[49:42.120 --> 49:45.160]  Guys, I think it was great, but there's no reason to...
[49:45.160 --> 49:47.340]  We gotta find stuff we care about.
[49:47.480 --> 49:47.780]  Baywatch!
[49:48.040 --> 49:48.320]  Exactly.
[49:49.180 --> 49:50.360]  Like Skeeter Bronson?
[49:50.660 --> 49:52.200]  Now, the Beastmaster...
[49:52.200 --> 49:54.180]  Now, that's some fucking serious film right there.
[49:54.180 --> 49:57.540]  If you guys haven't seen it, Mark Singer, we should watch the fucking Beastmaster.
[49:57.800 --> 49:58.500]  Holy shit.
[49:58.840 --> 49:59.560]  That's a good film.
[49:59.700 --> 50:02.060]  And you might feel differently about that sword if we watched it.
[50:02.420 --> 50:03.360]  I mean, I like the sword.
[50:06.400 --> 50:06.840]  Beetlejuice.
[50:07.700 --> 50:08.900]  How are we back at the...
[50:08.900 --> 50:11.080]  John Belushi's hat is just a hat.
[50:11.180 --> 50:12.720]  From his personal collection.
[50:13.580 --> 50:14.280]  Benji at work!
[50:15.280 --> 50:15.620]  Benji!
[50:16.280 --> 50:17.180]  Oh, my God.
[50:17.500 --> 50:18.520]  He's so cheap.
[50:18.880 --> 50:19.340]  We need him.
[50:19.560 --> 50:20.060]  We need it.
[50:20.200 --> 50:20.960]  We need it.
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.000]  Dude...
[50:23.340 --> 50:24.560]  What is this?
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.120]  I'm not opposed to the Benji stand-in.
[50:29.200 --> 50:30.160]  500 bucks?
[50:30.500 --> 50:31.760]  It's from 1979.
[50:32.440 --> 50:34.320]  I'm really not opposed to that.
[50:34.560 --> 50:36.860]  I mean, Benji was a fucking great character.
[50:37.120 --> 50:37.380]  Yeah!
[50:37.620 --> 50:39.660]  I mean, I've never seen Benji at work.
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.620]  I'm not opposed to watching it because we have the stand-in for Benji.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.440]  Was Benji...
[50:45.960 --> 50:46.800]  Did I...
[50:46.800 --> 50:48.500]  Was Benji in my dog draft?
[50:48.680 --> 50:49.400]  I think I used him.
[50:49.420 --> 50:50.000]  He might have been.
[50:50.000 --> 50:50.640]  He might have been.
[50:50.900 --> 50:52.060]  Might have been.
[50:52.220 --> 50:54.140]  I think Benji was one of my picks in the dog draft.
[50:54.360 --> 50:55.160]  Yeah, hold on. Let me look.
[50:55.260 --> 50:56.520]  It's a 45-year-old dog.
[50:56.960 --> 50:57.240]  Yeah.
[50:57.560 --> 50:58.020]  Oh, man.
[50:58.200 --> 51:00.280]  You either pick Benji or Boomer, and I'm pretty sure I picked Benji.
[51:00.780 --> 51:01.560]  Here's the back.
[51:02.700 --> 51:04.560]  I think we gotta keep Benji in the rotation.
[51:04.580 --> 51:06.940]  All right, all right. We'll hang on to it.
[51:07.580 --> 51:09.840]  I mean, he was in one of our content already.
[51:09.980 --> 51:10.840]  We gotta consider it.
[51:10.860 --> 51:13.060]  Benny and June seems like a movie that Geoff likes.
[51:13.300 --> 51:14.200]  I can't stand that movie.
[51:14.580 --> 51:15.140]  Oh, really?
[51:15.280 --> 51:15.600]  Yeah.
[51:15.860 --> 51:16.760]  Me fucking neither.
[51:16.760 --> 51:17.540]  So self-indulgent.
[51:18.080 --> 51:19.620]  I don't like it at all.
[51:19.620 --> 51:21.200]  I don't like that movie at all.
[51:21.380 --> 51:21.760]  I fucking hate that film.
[51:21.760 --> 51:22.660]  I hate that film.
[51:22.960 --> 51:23.880]  Beverly Hills Cop.
[51:23.960 --> 51:24.540]  Beverly Hills Cop!
[51:26.380 --> 51:26.840]  Barabons.
[51:27.340 --> 51:29.420]  Ooh, I wonder if Benji's gonna like coffee.
[51:29.540 --> 51:29.980]  Oh, that's good. I like Barabons.
[51:30.300 --> 51:30.460]  Yeah.
[51:35.400 --> 51:36.240]  Anus Andy.
[51:36.700 --> 51:37.540]  Dude, we gotta get this.
[51:37.800 --> 51:37.820]  Whoa!
[51:38.640 --> 51:39.880]  We have vacancies, bro.
[51:40.120 --> 51:41.520]  Dude, bitten ear pieces.
[51:41.740 --> 51:42.300]  It's Anus and Andy.
[51:42.340 --> 51:42.720]  That's funny.
[51:45.100 --> 51:46.040]  Oh, wow!
[51:46.260 --> 51:47.080]  Oh, shit.
[51:47.520 --> 51:49.680]  Production-made all-seeing eye. That's really cool.
[51:49.840 --> 51:50.780]  That's also very cool.
[51:50.780 --> 51:52.840]  Wow, current bids are already up there, too.
[51:52.920 --> 51:54.040]  People are gonna go crazy for that.
[51:54.540 --> 51:56.000]  Well, everybody loves Big Trouble in Little China.
[51:56.440 --> 51:56.620]  Yeah.
[51:56.740 --> 51:57.340]  Should buy that for Blaine.
[51:58.800 --> 51:59.200]  Yup.
[51:59.660 --> 52:00.040]  Blade.
[52:00.720 --> 52:01.840]  It's an aluminum stake.
[52:01.840 --> 52:03.080]  Ooh, aluminum stake. That's cool.
[52:03.080 --> 52:04.920]  And here's Blade Trinity's costume.
[52:06.180 --> 52:06.460]  Cool.
[52:06.920 --> 52:08.600]  Blade Trinity was not good.
[52:08.800 --> 52:09.060]  Nope.
[52:09.060 --> 52:09.200]  Nope.
[52:09.420 --> 52:10.100]  So bad.
[52:10.480 --> 52:11.120]  Never saw that one.
[52:11.900 --> 52:12.980]  Well, you do yourself a favor.
[52:13.480 --> 52:15.500]  It's the one with Ryan Reynolds, right?
[52:15.620 --> 52:16.240]  Yeah, Ryan Reynolds.
[52:16.420 --> 52:16.620]  It is.
[52:17.940 --> 52:18.340]  Jessica...
[52:20.360 --> 52:20.760]  Jessica...
[52:20.760 --> 52:21.580]  Jessica Biel.
[52:21.620 --> 52:21.940]  Jessica Biel.
[52:22.220 --> 52:27.760]  And former WWF World Heavyweight Champion and current owner, Hunter Hurst Helmsley, Triple H.
[52:28.820 --> 52:29.440]  Oh, yeah.
[52:29.540 --> 52:29.720]  That's true.
[52:30.360 --> 52:33.460]  He runs fast, which just means they sped up the footage.
[52:33.640 --> 52:35.340]  And it looks so fucking funny.
[52:35.540 --> 52:36.940]  It is the funniest part of that movie.
[52:37.080 --> 52:37.500]  It rocks.
[52:38.540 --> 52:39.740]  Dude, Blade Runner.
[52:39.900 --> 52:40.560]  More Blade Runner.
[52:41.440 --> 52:42.220]  The Blob.
[52:42.400 --> 52:43.300]  Those guns are cool, though.
[52:43.980 --> 52:44.640]  Blue Beetle.
[52:45.040 --> 52:45.820]  Blue Chips.
[52:46.060 --> 52:46.880]  That's kind of cool.
[52:48.680 --> 52:49.160]  Bogus?
[52:49.160 --> 52:49.720]  Wow.
[52:51.260 --> 52:52.020]  No idea.
[52:52.500 --> 52:53.440]  Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[52:54.100 --> 52:54.260]  Yeah.
[52:55.200 --> 52:56.660]  A lot of Dracula stuff.
[52:57.520 --> 52:58.620]  Breaking Bad Brazil?
[52:59.540 --> 53:00.360]  That's wild.
[53:00.760 --> 53:01.280]  That's weird.
[53:02.040 --> 53:03.000]  A lot of Breaking Bad.
[53:04.420 --> 53:05.880]  Who worked on Breaking Bad?
[53:05.940 --> 53:06.720]  Now, get rid of stuff.
[53:07.900 --> 53:08.660]  Broken Arrow.
[53:09.600 --> 53:10.200]  That was a good movie.
[53:10.720 --> 53:11.140]  Oh, yeah.
[53:11.280 --> 53:11.820]  Model Miniatures.
[53:12.020 --> 53:13.780]  You wanted to rewatch that you were seeing the other day.
[53:14.120 --> 53:14.320]  Yeah.
[53:14.820 --> 53:16.180]  A lot of Buck Rogers stuff.
[53:16.740 --> 53:18.080]  A lot of Buck Rogers stuff.
[53:18.840 --> 53:20.520]  Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
[53:20.740 --> 53:22.560]  The Bucket List from The Bucket List!
[53:22.820 --> 53:23.880]  That's really funny.
[53:25.300 --> 53:26.780]  Dude, a titular prop.
[53:26.820 --> 53:27.480]  That's pretty cool.
[53:27.740 --> 53:28.380]  That is pretty cool.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.200]  Cable Guy.
[53:31.860 --> 53:32.720]  Oh, God.
[53:33.820 --> 53:34.400]  Photos.
[53:34.780 --> 53:35.480]  Set photos.
[53:37.080 --> 53:38.100]  Can you need casino?
[53:38.460 --> 53:39.860]  Oh, Tangier's Chips.
[53:39.920 --> 53:40.540]  That's pretty cool.
[53:40.900 --> 53:42.920]  Dude, Bad Checks from Catch a Fish You Can.

[53:49.020 --> 53:49.940]  The Bosley Box.
[53:50.140 --> 53:50.380]  Yeah.
[53:50.640 --> 53:52.740]  We can remake it and make Eric's Angels.
[53:55.020 --> 53:56.540]  That's pretty cheap for that, I think.
[53:57.960 --> 53:58.940]  Chronicles of Riddick.
[53:59.720 --> 54:00.560]  Big costume there.
[54:01.460 --> 54:02.500]  Geoff did pick Benji.
[54:02.880 --> 54:02.920]  Yes.
[54:03.820 --> 54:04.700]  Oh, hell yeah.
[54:04.800 --> 54:05.060]  Thank you.
[54:05.220 --> 54:06.960]  We might have to make the Benji happen, dude.
[54:08.400 --> 54:09.260]  City Slickers.
[54:10.220 --> 54:10.660]  Clifford.
[54:11.020 --> 54:13.820]  Oh, that fucking Martin Short movie, Clifford.
[54:13.960 --> 54:14.660]  Oh, my God.
[54:14.800 --> 54:15.960]  Meet James Bond.
[54:15.960 --> 54:17.160]  Is that Casino...
[54:17.860 --> 54:18.700]  Oh, Clifford.
[54:19.180 --> 54:20.980]  It just says right down at the bottom, Meet James Bond.
[54:21.220 --> 54:21.840]  From Russia With Love.
[54:21.900 --> 54:22.640]  But it says Clifford.
[54:23.060 --> 54:23.180]  Yeah.
[54:24.760 --> 54:25.480]  From Russia...
[54:25.480 --> 54:25.640]  Weird.
[54:26.640 --> 54:28.260]  Must have been on the wall in that scene.
[54:28.360 --> 54:28.460]  All right.
[54:28.760 --> 54:29.960]  We've been going for...
[54:31.060 --> 54:32.700]  We're still deep in this thing.
[54:32.780 --> 54:34.000]  We're on C again.
[54:34.480 --> 54:35.700]  What are we...
[54:35.700 --> 54:36.420]  What are we aiming for?
[54:36.420 --> 54:36.960]  Yeah, I don't know.
[54:37.080 --> 54:37.540]  Different plots.
[54:37.720 --> 54:41.080]  I think we're headed towards D and then we'll probably hit E.
[54:41.620 --> 54:41.980]  Okay.
[54:42.200 --> 54:43.780]  Here, I'll just do this.
[54:44.300 --> 54:45.100]  How's this speed?
[54:45.100 --> 54:45.560]  Faster?
[54:45.740 --> 54:46.180]  Oh, it's good.
[54:46.340 --> 54:46.620]  It's great.
[54:46.740 --> 54:47.280]  Lovely speed.
[54:47.380 --> 54:47.680]  I love it.
[54:47.920 --> 54:48.140]  Okay.
[54:48.800 --> 54:49.720]  We'll stop the conveyor belt.
[54:49.760 --> 54:50.380]  Oh, a Bible.
[54:50.900 --> 54:51.620]  Ooh, Copland.
[54:51.820 --> 54:52.060]  Oh, Copland.
[54:52.160 --> 54:54.260]  That's a movie that I think is almost really good.
[54:54.400 --> 54:54.640]  Yeah.
[54:54.740 --> 54:55.020]  It is good.
[54:55.020 --> 54:57.600]  I think Copland is the thing where it's like all the pieces.
[54:57.900 --> 54:58.660]  Critters 4.
[54:59.160 --> 54:59.620]  The Crows.
[54:59.620 --> 55:00.440]  The Mighty Dogs.
[55:00.520 --> 55:01.160]  Oh, it's D3.
[55:01.300 --> 55:01.580]  Fuck it.
[55:01.960 --> 55:02.180]  Yeah.
[55:02.980 --> 55:03.340]  Dancer.
[55:03.440 --> 55:04.580]  That is terrifying.
[55:04.640 --> 55:05.200]  That's gross.
[55:05.200 --> 55:05.860]  That'd be your death mask.
[55:05.920 --> 55:06.520]  I don't like that.
[55:07.100 --> 55:07.960]  A lot of Dark Crystal.
[55:08.600 --> 55:09.100]  Dark Man.
[55:09.100 --> 55:09.600]  Dark Man.
[55:09.860 --> 55:10.620]  Das Boot.
[55:10.860 --> 55:11.460]  Das Boot.
[55:11.680 --> 55:12.260]  Death Proof.
[55:12.320 --> 55:13.140]  Oh, a body from Death Proof.
[55:13.140 --> 55:14.440]  They got more Death Proof stuff, or is that it?
[55:14.480 --> 55:14.700]  Damn.
[55:15.080 --> 55:15.580]  Wanted more.
[55:16.000 --> 55:16.440]  Dick Tracy.
[55:16.440 --> 55:16.840]  Dick Tracy.

[59:39.940 --> 59:40.940]  I don't want to look at it.
[59:41.040 --> 59:41.440]  You know what I mean?
[59:41.480 --> 59:43.320]  I feel like for Gremlins 2 it should be cheaper.
[59:43.340 --> 59:43.980]  Is that a Halo?

[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:46.660]  He signed it.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.680]  It's one of a thousand!
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.060]  He signed it though.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.580]  Yeah, but still $800.
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:52.740]  That's pretty cool.
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.020]  Yeah.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:54.080]  It is cool.
[01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:55.580]  There's not much cooler.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.840]  Who's Adam Garbill?
[01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:05.590]  Oh shit, Hard Rain!
[01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:07.310]  We were just talking about that yesterday!
[01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.930]  How crazy.
[01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.870]  That's so funny.
[01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:09.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:11.510]  Harry Potter?
[01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:12.710]  We can sleep with this?
[01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:12.910]  Plow, plow, plow.
[01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:13.750]  Here we go.
[01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.430]  Haunted Mansion.
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:15.450]  Hey, there it is!
[01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:16.530]  Haunted Mansion, dude!
[01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:18.030]  You like that, right?
[01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:18.530]  Oh man, crazy.
[01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.830]  Cool colors.
[01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:21.670]  Hellboy.
[01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:26.210]  I couldn't tell if Gavin was messing with me about what action scenes from Beverly Hills Cop 1 or 2.
[01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:28.610]  I trust your mansion.
[01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:29.510]  Hellraiser!
[01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:31.730]  It's not a Hellraiser, but this is all like the recent Hellraiser.
[01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:34.010]  Don't like Hellraiser.
[01:01:35.330 --> 01:01:36.270]  Holmes and Watson.
[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:37.210]  Everyone's favorite.
[01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.930]  Wet Bandits!
[01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:38.550]  Woah, woah, woah, woah.
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:39.870]  Yeah, when is this Wet Bandits?
[01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:42.310]  Escape during prison?
[01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:50.750]  The tone in which you deliver that was like that this was a real thing and that we needed to be on the lookout.
[01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.950]  Guys, guys, did you hear the news?
[01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:54.790]  It's real that I want that.
[01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:55.130]  Yeah.
[01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:57.910]  I don't feel anything for this whatsoever.
[01:01:58.050 --> 01:01:59.070]  You don't feel anything for Home Alone?
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.250]  Home Alone 2, I don't care about Home Alone 2.
[01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:04.610]  They were the Wet Bandits before they were the Sticky Bandits.
[01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:05.650]  Yeah, come on, man.
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.750]  There you go.
[01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:10.190]  Also, Home Alone 2 doesn't get the credit it deserves, it's a great film.
[01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:11.470]  Phenomenal sequel.
[01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.630]  Nothing against the movie, I just don't find the newspaper aspect.
[01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:17.090]  Yeah, there's nothing, just a printed thing, it doesn't do anything for me.
[01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:18.790]  Okay, it's on the list.
[01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.610]  I think it's cool to put in a frame.
[01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.310]  Yeah.
[01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.610]  See, I...
[01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:24.290]  Oh, honey, I shrunk the kid's stuff.
[01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:27.250]  I would never want this in anything that I am.
[01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.510]  I don't want to look at it every day.
[01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.310]  You don't want a big ant?
[01:02:29.490 --> 01:02:30.290]  No, disgusting.
[01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.090]  Fuck the Battle Royale.
[01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.730]  Hot Shots Part 2, though.
[01:02:32.770 --> 01:02:33.930]  I want the Hot Shots Part 2.
[01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:34.930]  And there it is.
[01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:38.530]  I wish I gave a shit about that movie, because that is fucking funny.
[01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:40.940]  That's what Warner Brothers did to Rooster Teeth.
[01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:50.070]  Dude, Hudson Hawk.
[01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.270]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:52.710]  Oh, shit!
[01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:54.050]  Can you go up for a second?
[01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.370]  Sutter Cane's In the Mouth of Madness?
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:58.210]  Is that screen matched?
[01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.910]  Oh, it's not.
[01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.210]  Okay.
[01:03:00.090 --> 01:03:01.510]  I'm a big fan of that movie.
[01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:02.730]  Personally.
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.110]  Huge fan of that movie.

[01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:19.370]  Palace Banquet Beetle, that's cool.
[01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:23.370]  There you go.
[01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:24.630]  Temple of Doom Wrist Pick.
[01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:27.070]  Dude, if they had the monkey brains, I'd get that shit.
[01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:30.090]  Ku Jacket and a Hat.
[01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.550]  Yeah.

[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:51.100]  It.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:51.900]  It.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:52.260]  Ew.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.560]  James and the Giant Peach.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.180]  Oh, what a nightmare.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:58.120]  I hated that movie.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.760]  James and the Man with the Golden Gun.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:00.900]  That's fucking cool.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.260]  It's a replica, though.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:02.720]  Yep.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:06.200]  Made of a pen and a lighter and a cufflink and all that.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:06.900]  Yep.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:07.840]  Very cool.
[01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:09.020]  I love that.

[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.280]  The Golden Eye...
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.680]  Oh, it's just the same model.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.820]  Same model, yeah.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.200]  You could just buy one of those now.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:19.600]  Yeah.

[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.260]  We can check it out, but...
[01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:32.500]  Nah.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.300]  I got low hopes for this one.
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:34.860]  Yeah.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.380]  That's fucking cool.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.640]  I'll keep it on the list.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.500]  I was more into the box, the booster action figures, but that is beyond what I'd want to pay for them.
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:45.740]  Yeah.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:47.620]  The 600 is the max for me.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:50.360]  Judge Dredd.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.640]  Even that is, like, living luxuriously.

[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.280]  Oh, the helmet!

[01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.810]  Yeah.
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.370]  I feel like there's not going to be any Jurassic Park stuff.
[01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:11.170]  Wait, wait, no, no, no.
[01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:15.530]  Sam Neill's personal set of cast autographed Funko Pops.
[01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:16.230]  Where?

[01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.890]  Sam Neill's personal Funko Pop collection.
[01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:21.210]  Oh, no.
[01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:24.370]  You think Sam Neill gives a fuck about his Funko Pops?
[01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.870]  Everyone...
[01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:27.490]  No, because he signed it also.
[01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:32.430]  Guys, that fucking Karate Kid trophy is so fucking cool.
[01:05:33.690 --> 01:05:37.770]  I like how shit it looks so that he can say to people that it's the actual Karate Kid trophy.
[01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.330]  Can you click on it so I can see the picture of Daniel holding it up?
[01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:45.930]  Sorry, man, no picture of him holding it.
[01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:47.830]  Was it only used in a wide...
[01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:49.810]  Maybe that's all they bothered to find.
[01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:50.930]  That is so fucking cool.
[01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:52.110]  That's fine.

[01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.030]  Oh, but it's just the design.
[01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:04.590]  That's a shame.
[01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.170]  LA Confidential, that's cool.
[01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:08.970]  If you could get the actual Krull blade, that'd be fucking awesome.
[01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.450]  Ooh, Land of the Dead!
[01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:11.070]  Lassie.

[01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:20.810]  Oh, that's cool.
[01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:23.250]  That's a good selection of sunglasses.
[01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.130]  There is a lot of sunglasses.
[01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:26.890]  Oh, Lethal Weapon.
[01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:28.470]  Metropolitan Police ID.
[01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:29.410]  That's neat.
[01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.250]  But it's production made.
[01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:32.990]  It's not like a screen match thing.
[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:35.850]  Life of Pi.
[01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:37.790]  Never saw it.
[01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:39.630]  It's fine.

[01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:49.690]  We're getting through it.
[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:51.390]  Ooh, Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:53.190]  Looper!
[01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.650]  Dude, you'd be just like Looper from Looper.

[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.590]  Did anyone here see The Love Guru?
[01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:01.170]  No.
[01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.950]  Really, you did?
[01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.210]  Yeah.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:05.530]  Mike Myers did it.
[01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.070]  Nah, it wasn't good.
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.410]  Oh, Major League!
[01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:11.130]  Oh shit!
[01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:11.810]  Oh!
[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:15.750]  We haven't talked, this is my favorite movie.
[01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:16.430]  Dude, me too!
[01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.930]  Is it really?
[01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:18.570]  I love this movie.
[01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:19.090]  It's not bad.
[01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.490]  This is legitimately my number one favorite movie.
[01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:25.330]  Oh God, I love this movie.
[01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:33.110]  Yeah, this is from the scene where he's going to send him down to the miners, but then he can't see and that's when he learns he needs glasses.
[01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.950]  Yeah.
[01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:44.250]  And then this other shirt is when Jake runs the bases, like pretending he hits the home run, and they both watch it from the dugout when he crosses home.
[01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:47.150]  They clap and they make fun of him, and he's wearing that shirt.
[01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.650]  And this is the tie from dinner.
[01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:50.210]  Wow.
[01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:50.850]  That's so fun.
[01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:52.270]  That's really cool.
[01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:53.550]  That's fucking cool!
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.670]  Look, we're not going to buy it, I think it's great.
[01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:57.650]  We might, we might.
[01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:59.510]  Alright, I'll leave it open, I think it's great.
[01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:02.030]  This is nothing from my favorite movie on here.
[01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:05.450]  I think the jacket is cooler.
[01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:06.290]  What's your favorite movie?
[01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.250]  Uh, Basketball.
[01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.030]  Oh yeah.
[01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:11.070]  Imagine if they had a lazy boy.
[01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:11.890]  Yeah.
[01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:12.810]  Oh man.
[01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.830]  See, this is from Major League 2.
[01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:16.650]  Major League 2 is not very good.
[01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:18.270]  Jacket's cool though.
[01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.410]  Yeah, but we can just buy a cool jacket.
[01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:21.750]  Better than 3.
[01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:24.130]  Mole Rats!
[01:08:25.850 --> 01:08:26.890]  Screen match.
[01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:27.650]  Oh man.
[01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:29.810]  Oh, Mars Attacks!
[01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:31.350]  Is Mars Attacks good?
[01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.470]  I've never seen it.
[01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:33.890]  I don't like it.
[01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:34.610]  I don't like it.
[01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:35.730]  I know a lot of people that do.
[01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:37.810]  It's got everyone in it.
[01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:44.130]  It's, it's got a tremendous amount of charm and style, but the movie itself is not great.
[01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:44.450]  Right.
[01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:44.930]  Okay.
[01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:46.070]  Name an actor though.
[01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:46.810]  They're probably in it.
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:47.350]  Yeah.
[01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.850]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:51.910]  The only thing that I like about it is that when Eric, the actor, would call in to Stern,
[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.490]  they would play.
[01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:55.830]  I had that kid.
[01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:56.290]  What was his name?
[01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:57.010]  Lucas Haas.
[01:08:57.190 --> 01:08:58.910]  It was like the last movie you saw him in.
[01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.290]  Yeah.
[01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:00.550]  Oh.
[01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:01.810]  Skip all of this.
[01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:02.850]  He's my Chemical Romance guy.
[01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:04.050]  Marvel Daredevil.
[01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.430]  Here we go.
[01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:05.210]  Master of the Universe.
[01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:05.830]  The Mask!
[01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.110]  The Mask's tie.
[01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:07.950]  Jim Carrey's necktie.
[01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:12.530]  Gets shot, I think, doesn't it?
[01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.050]  A lot of Master of the Universe stuff.
[01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.310]  Wow, The Matrix.
[01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:17.170]  Like, actual The Matrix.
[01:09:18.370 --> 01:09:19.330]  Sentinel Arm.
[01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:20.950]  Second best.
[01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:26.370]  No proling.
[01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:30.450]  Medicine Man.
[01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:32.150]  Don't even know what that is.
[01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.790]  Men in Black 3.
[01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:33.150]  Men in Black.
[01:09:36.890 --> 01:09:37.750]  It's not good.
[01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:38.670]  Oh, God, wow.
[01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:39.570]  A minority report.
[01:09:40.190 --> 01:09:42.890]  Dude, that fucking, the Mimic 2 thing is fucking crazy.
[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.250]  That's terrifying.
[01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:44.190]  Oh, dude, Geoff.
[01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:45.310]  Here's Mighty Joe Young.
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:48.150]  We can put it on the animatronic skeleton that we're getting.
[01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.070]  Oh, my God!
[01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:49.410]  That's great.
[01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:50.230]  Finally.
[01:09:50.610 --> 01:09:52.390]  We have one complete Mighty Joe Young.
[01:09:54.610 --> 01:09:56.270]  Mr. Ed TV Show.
[01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:57.310]  What the fuck?
[01:09:57.450 --> 01:09:58.130]  Mr. Ed's shoe?
[01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:00.050]  I'm sure, display.
[01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:06.090]  Okay, so I heard that this was a big Mighty Morphin Power Rangers collection.
[01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.910]  And I don't know why.
[01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:12.910]  But apparently there's like a bunch of Power Rangers.
[01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:13.310]  That's a different auction.
[01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:14.730]  Oh, is it?
[01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:15.370]  Okay.
[01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:16.730]  Yeah, it's a later one.
[01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:17.970]  That's crazy.
[01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.730]  I heard that there's like so much Power Rangers stuff that's gonna like hit.
[01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.370]  That's nuts.
[01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:26.330]  Yeah, I think Hasbro is like getting out of Power Rangers and it's like this is our warehouse of all the shit.
[01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:27.530]  Mr. 3000.
[01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.970]  Mr. 3000.
[01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.350]  Wow.
[01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.030]  Mrs. Doubtfire and Replica.
[01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:32.190]  Creepy.
[01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:33.150]  Replica, Replica.
[01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.990]  Yuck.
[01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:36.170]  Muppets Take Me to Hatton.
[01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.310]  That's cool.
[01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.390]  Muppet Pin.
[01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:40.930]  I preferred when they did over Jason.
[01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:43.210]  It's a lot better.
[01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:45.410]  I really wanted Monuments Men to be a good movie.
[01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.570]  Christmas Vacation.
[01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:49.770]  Oh, it's a crew jacket.
[01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:50.730]  That's cool though.
[01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:55.430]  Deck the halls and light the lights.
[01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:57.450]  Natural Born Killers stuff, Geoff.
[01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:58.330]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:00.710]  Man, that was a...
[01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:03.090]  That was a fun time when that movie came out.
[01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.990]  I bet it was.
[01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:07.770]  North by Northwest.
[01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:08.310]  Wow.
[01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.850]  People were freaking out, right, Geoff?
[01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:14.310]  Dude, I saw it in the theater and it's literally what they reported on happened.
[01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:18.470]  I saw probably half the theater left at some point during the film.
[01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:19.210]  That's cool.
[01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:19.610]  Michael Scott.
[01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.670]  Just in disgust.
[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.310]  Michael Scott's suit is really funny.
[01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:23.630]  Ugly.
[01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:24.910]  So funny.
[01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.430]  It is.
[01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.850]  Yeah.
[01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:26.950]  So ugly.
[01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.890]  Officer and the Gentleman.
[01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:29.630]  I hate that film.
[01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:33.970]  I was seven years old when that movie came out and my mom made me watch it a hundred times.
[01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:35.610]  It was always a good movie.
[01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:39.390]  Guys, ParaNorman.
[01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.990]  Oh, good.
[01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:42.150]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:44.610]  A lot of Patriot.
[01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:45.490]  Pearl Harbor.

[01:11:48.690 --> 01:11:49.250]  Pink Cannon.
[01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:50.290]  Oh, but that's the...
[01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:51.190]  2007.
[01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.030]  Full-size Black Pearl Cannon.
[01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:54.690]  And the goo.
[01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.230]  Beneath the Planet of the Apes.
[01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:58.330]  Planet of the Apes.
[01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:00.450]  Platoon.
[01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:02.710]  Polar Express.
[01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:03.030]  Wow.
[01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.750]  Dude.
[01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:07.650]  Like, let Blaine know about Predator shit.
[01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:08.270]  He's gonna flip.
[01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.690]  Wasn't Polar Express animated?
[01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:11.170]  Yeah.
[01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:14.330]  Dude, Schwarzenegger's Fingerless Gloves.
[01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:15.390]  Blaine's gonna buy it today.
[01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:20.010]  Light-up Icon Replica Mask.
[01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:20.870]  This is all Blaine stuff.
[01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:21.890]  This is so Blaine shit.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.810]  I like Predator too.
[01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:24.070]  I think it's nuts.
[01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:25.570]  Outpules from Prometheus.
[01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.170]  I like Predator too.
[01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:28.750]  Toe gloves.
[01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:29.770]  Toe shoes.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:31.850]  Charlize Theron's toe shoes.
[01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:33.950]  Quick in the Dead.
[01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.470]  Wow, Raging Bull autograph?
[01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:40.810]  I feel like there's gotta be a lot of foot perverts out there that would go crazy for those toe shoes if they knew about them.
[01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:41.630]  Yeah, Nick.
[01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.130]  Check it out, Resident Evil Extinction.
[01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:46.730]  Can you imagine buying Hannibal Lecter's soap balls?
[01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:48.110]  Oh, Richie Rich.
[01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:49.430]  That is some good...
[01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:50.370]  Oh, I love that movie!
[01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:51.650]  ...smell master.
[01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.970]  That's funny.
[01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.550]  Smell master.
[01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:55.370]  Hey, but also, I heard what you said, Eric, motherfucker.
[01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.610]  You ever want to look like Tom Green in Road Trip?
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:02.710]  Tom Green's clothes from Road Trip.
[01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:06.150]  Was he wearing that when he put the mouse in his mouth?
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:08.330]  Let's see what pictures they have.
[01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.030]  He's near the mouth.
[01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:14.990]  That's funny.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.220]  Robin Hood.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.720]  Alright, getting on to 14.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.540]  We'll start trucking through.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.400]  We've been trucking.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:25.880]  Here's some more stuff from The Rock.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.180]  The Rock.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.580]  Any of this?
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.480]  I mean, we have...
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.740]  I think we have our best replica of any of this.
[01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.700]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.040]  Rocky.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.920]  That's that Rocky.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.200]  That Stallone full thing.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.380]  No, down.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.580]  Oh, oh, oh.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.460]  The full body.
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:44.720]  This here?
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:45.460]  The replica.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.160]  The wax.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:46.680]  Yeah.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.280]  What a piece of shit.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.020]  That looks terrible.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:52.920]  Rollerball.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.240]  Creed's keys.
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.520]  Rum Diary.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.380]  Saving Private Ryan's school.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:00.980]  Oh, Sandlot.
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:01.440]  That's neat.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:02.380]  Oh.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:04.840]  Saw 5.
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.940]  Scary movie.
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:06.340]  Cat.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.220]  This is what Smee looks like, but different colors.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:13.920]  Scrooged.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:14.820]  That's awesome.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.020]  That's pretty great.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:16.740]  Taxi cab.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.180]  That's fucking...
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.360]  That is so cool.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.000]  Wow.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.180]  Seven.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.160]  Most of the seven.
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.660]  Series of unfortunate events.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:25.300]  The Shadow.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.600]  Oh, Sicario's gun.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.420]  That's pretty neat.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:34.820]  It's neat, but it's like, that's the gun he uses to murder kids with.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.300]  Yeah, he kills them, and then his wife, and then makes them eat dinner.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.060]  It's great.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.420]  Back to the Future.
[01:14:42.580 --> 01:14:43.120]  A lot of Back to the...
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:43.540]  Blade Runner.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.900]  How are we back around to Bees?
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:47.020]  What happened?
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:47.900]  Bees is different lots.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.040]  Are we just onto, like, pieces of...
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:51.900]  Coming up.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:52.840]  Steven Spielberg.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:53.500]  Simpson's Bartman.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.260]  Do the Bartman video.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.080]  Oh, it's an animation self from it?
[01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:58.940]  That's pretty...
[01:14:58.940 --> 01:14:59.620]  It's painted.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.540]  Dude, I'm doing the fucking Bartman.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.100]  Hell yeah.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:02.760]  Oh, fuck.
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:03.680]  There we go.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.620]  Holy shit.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:05.880]  There we go.
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.100]  Oh my God.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:09.960]  Oh, and right next to it.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.720]  You and I, I think, we looked at different things.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:13.480]  Hold on.
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.440]  Yeah, we looked at different fucking things.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.560]  No, where's Chip Hazard, you son of a bitch?
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.120]  Alright, alright, alright.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.760]  Oh, man.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.800]  There's already people bidding on it.
[01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:24.980]  Yeah, it's...
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:28.020]  I mean, 4,000...
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.160]  It's a toy replica.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:30.080]  Yeah.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.500]  Limited edition, though.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.960]  And it's the same material used from the film.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.540]  Wow.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:40.880]  But the fact that there's one bid...
[01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:41.700]  Yep.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.260]  4,000, it's a little high.
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:44.880]  Yeah.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.560]  We definitely need content around it.
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:49.240]  Do you think it's Tommy Lee Jones himself bidding on it?
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.220]  Yeah, he wants the Chip Hazard thing so bad.
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.040]  He wants it back.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.600]  He's like, I have to have these destroyed.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:55.540]  Yep.
[01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:57.540]  Now.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:58.260]  Now.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.680]  Now we're talking.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.180]  This seems like we can afford this.
[01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.420]  This is Eric's thing.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.520]  This is screen matched.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.060]  This is what he wore.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:09.900]  This is it, baby.
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:11.920]  Look at...
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.260]  Guys, we gotta watch this fucking movie.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.480]  We have to...
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:14.940]  Look!
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.180]  Oh, my God.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:16.780]  The blood's still on it.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.000]  Dude, look at that.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.880]  Can you imagine going like...
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.700]  Dude, that's it right here.
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:24.680]  Look at that suit.
[01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.220]  It's the perfect...
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:27.920]  It's...
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.140]  Yeah.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.440]  Oh, I wanna see you in that, Eric.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.300]  It's pretty nice.
[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.660]  It's so...
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:36.280]  And nobody's bid on it yet.
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:36.680]  No.
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:37.880]  There's one...
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.360]  Fuck.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:39.100]  No.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.040]  There's one bid.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.120]  Guys.
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.620]  That's my bid.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:43.640]  Is it really?
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:44.380]  I put a bid on that.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:45.720]  Are you serious?
[01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:46.200]  What?
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:47.140]  I did the due diligence.
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:48.540]  I put the bid on.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.440]  Andrew.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.620]  I put Eric in the suit.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.500]  We gotta have a tuxedo replacement.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:53.660]  This rocks.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.580]  I put the bid in.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:57.780]  I figured if the company didn't...
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.460]  You know, if we voted no against it.
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.400]  That would suck.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.020]  So let's vote yes for it.
[01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.860]  We gotta...
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.680]  I vote yes.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.120]  We locked in the suit.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.280]  I wanna see a photo shoot with Eric in the snake.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.320]  I want him to go full snake.
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.240]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:09.600]  I do the same.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.820]  There's two things from snake guys.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.000]  I figured we couldn't go halfway.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.600]  I wanna see you wear the shitty watch, Eric.
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.960]  I want you to wear the necklace.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.320]  We have the minimal bid.
[01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.160]  So you already bid on all this shit knowing well before we started this.
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:27.580]  Yes.
[01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:28.500]  That's awesome.
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.280]  Yeah.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.380]  We're locked in.
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:34.840]  We can theoretically get it for the cheapest amount we possibly could.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.780]  That's why I wanted to put those bids in.
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:37.620]  Make sure nobody...
[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:37.860]  I love it.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.460]  Andrew, this rocks.
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.320]  I would love for us to watch.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.340]  I unfortunately think you might be away, Geoff.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.600]  When this lot goes up.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.820]  Watch it live.
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:49.600]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.500]  Oh, man.
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:50.920]  That sucks.
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:51.420]  When does the lot go live?
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.200]  Do you know when that is?
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:56.320]  It ends on Saturday the 17th.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:58.720]  Yeah.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.500]  I'm away.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.840]  He is away.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.520]  But we'll figure something out for it.
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:03.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:04.720]  We'll lock it in.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:05.220]  We'll let you know.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.720]  Dude, this is so crazy.
[01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.300]  I want you to wear the rings.
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.540]  I want us to do a photo shoot.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.560]  I want to recreate the Snake Eyes poster, which is just him.
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.220]  That should be our...
[01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.280]  That could be the first merchandise we sell.
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.300]  Be the Snake Eyes poster.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.880]  This is so awesome.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.880]  Oh, this is so fucking cool.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.040]  Can you look at the Snake Eyes poster, Eric?
[01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:24.720]  Can you bring that up?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.960]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:30.670 --> 01:18:34.450]  I've already searched for it previously, so...
[01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:36.070]  Check it out.
[01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:36.750]  Looking cool.
[01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:37.370]  I want...
[01:18:38.290 --> 01:18:40.690]  Like that with regular Eric.
[01:18:40.830 --> 01:18:41.450]  I want to recreate that.
[01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:42.150]  There's this.
[01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:43.250]  But here's the thing.
[01:18:44.430 --> 01:18:45.530]  We got more, baby.
[01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:46.650]  That is an insane...
[01:18:46.650 --> 01:18:47.710]  I've never seen that.
[01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:49.210]  That is crazy.
[01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:51.090]  Maybe we just do all of them.
[01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:53.230]  Maybe we try to recreate as many of the Snake Eyes.
[01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:57.550]  Could we also recreate some of the G.I. Joe's Snake Eyes movie posters as well?
[01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:58.550]  I think we have to.
[01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:59.890]  What the fuck?
[01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:01.870]  What is this?
[01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.290]  Did they make a G.I. Joe's Snake Eyes movie?
[01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:05.270]  Yeah, they did.
[01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.730]  Yeah, they did.
[01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:06.290]  Weird.
[01:19:06.610 --> 01:19:07.330]  Dude, check it out.
[01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:08.770]  See, that's what I was...
[01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:09.190]  In my head.
[01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:10.410]  That's the Snake Eyes poster.
[01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.270]  You see all the jewelry and everything.
[01:19:12.270 --> 01:19:13.710]  You're about to have those rings, potentially.
[01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:15.370]  Dude.
[01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:16.390]  Look at Gino.
[01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.770]  We can recreate that and have Gavin be her.
[01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:20.850]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.190]  Dude, this rocks.
[01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:24.530]  Andrew, this is so awesome.
[01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:26.310]  This is so fucking cool, dude.
[01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:27.450]  This is...
[01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:28.930]  Here we go.
[01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.390]  We have to do this.
[01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:33.650]  We have to watch this fucking movie.
[01:19:34.050 --> 01:19:34.750]  We have to.
[01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:35.010]  We're gonna watch it.
[01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:36.430]  He's so insane.
[01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:38.150]  Like, he's so insane in it, dude.
[01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:38.850]  It rocks.
[01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:39.750]  Oh, he's great.
[01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:43.170]  Maybe Gary Cedice will be at a convention and you can take a picture.
[01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.690]  Oh, definitely.
[01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:48.870]  Can you imagine meeting Nicolas Cage in his Snake Eyes outfit?
[01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:51.150]  Oh, that'd be so cool.
[01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:52.210]  Oh my God.
[01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:55.930]  What do you think the craziest Nick Cage performance is?
[01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:57.930]  Oh, that's tough.
[01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:01.090]  He's got... He's had so many, right?
[01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:02.690]  He's had so many insane ones.
[01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.110]  I would say maybe that movie Deadfall.
[01:20:04.210 --> 01:20:04.710]  You remember that?
[01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.450]  He was in?
[01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.850]  No.
[01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:08.130]  I haven't seen that.
[01:20:09.170 --> 01:20:11.610]  He sent you a picture of his face in it.
[01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.070]  Put it in the chat.
[01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:18.500]  Dear God.
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.080]  Oh my God.
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:20.300]  Holy shit.
[01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.040]  Oh, that's insane.
[01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.880]  He's... He's... It's a... It's another one of the...
[01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.660]  Just fucking insane performance.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:27.700]  Oh, great.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:29.180]  Man.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.500]  That's why I think of whatever I think of him.
[01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.940]  Okay, so we're locked in on Snake Eyes.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:34.800]  Mm-hmm.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:35.280]  It sounds like.
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.380]  I think it's fucking awesome.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:37.840]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:38.340]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.760]  So we got to factor that in when we're looking at other possible lots.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:42.420]  Okay.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.000]  I mean, do we even need to look anymore?
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.200]  I feel like we're locked in.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.140]  I feel like we got...
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:46.360]  That's good.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.740]  This is awesome.
[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:51.520]  Andrew, did you secretly place any other bids we're not aware of?
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:53.400]  No.
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.600]  Yeah, but I think we're done.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:55.320]  Okay.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.040]  Dude.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.600]  This is crazy.
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:20:58.540]  We...
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:01.240]  This is so fucking cool.
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.800]  This sucks.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:03.660]  This is awesome.
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.700]  I also am a little scared by the way Andrew said no and how long it's been.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.200]  Yeah, because...
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:09.120]  Because that's a yes.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:09.620]  It's definitely a yes.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:10.440]  No, it's...
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.040]  I'm just...
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.420]  I'm quickly scanning through.
[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:13.880]  We got a bunch more Star Trek stuff.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.240]  I'm making sure we're not missing anything.
[01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:15.500]  Okay.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.240]  That would be super exciting.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:17.740]  Oh, man.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.540]  This rules.
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.460]  Guys, this has been fun going through this.
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.260]  And...
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:28.980]  We have some other lots that we could definitely kind of poke around at and see if there's anything else we want to place bids on.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:31.780]  Fun things all around.
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.420]  I mean, the Happy Gilmore thing is pretty good.
[01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:33.840]  That's awesome.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.120]  Do we want to like...
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:35.520]  Oh, that's awesome.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.140]  Since this is maybe the only time we'll all be together, do we want to discuss some of that right now?
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:40.620]  Okay.
[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:41.940]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:42.320]  Prioritize.
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.860]  I'll start from the beginning.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.320]  Jim Carrey thing.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.380]  We're looking at four bids already.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:47.900]  Eh.
[01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:49.040]  Yeah, right?
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:49.680]  That's too much.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.100]  We're not going to get that cut.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:52.460]  Oh, but this...
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:54.860]  This is also too expensive, but I want it.
[01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:56.080]  I love it, but it's too expensive.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:56.580]  It's too expensive.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:57.320]  Too pricey.
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:58.320]  I was going to keep an eye on it.
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:21:59.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:21:59.620 --> 01:21:59.900]  Pink Panther.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.380]  That seems doable.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:02.720]  But it is that...
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:03.040]  That $4,000 to $8,000.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:04.000]  It's pretty expensive again.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:04.660]  Yeah.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:05.300]  Yeah.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.440]  But I mean, that's a lot of material for the price.
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:08.400]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:10.980]  That seems like the ceiling to me of something too expensive.
[01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:11.520]  Too expensive.
[01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:12.080]  Too expensive.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.580]  This is too expensive and there's already a bid.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:14.040]  Yeah.
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.420]  This has two bids.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:17.500]  I just don't really want it.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.060]  No.
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:19.740]  I feel the same way about that one.
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:20.480]  We can't...
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.360]  Yeah, we can't.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.140]  No.
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.700]  Now Benji.
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.140]  This was funny at the time.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:28.200]  I don't think we need to get Benji at work, but I like it.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:28.500]  I don't know.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:30.240]  I really like having the Benji.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.380]  I really like the Benji.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.440]  Let's keep Benji.
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.400]  Let's not cut Benji yet.
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:35.800]  I'm going to make you guys watch a Benji movie.
[01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.180]  Okay.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:36.720]  I'll watch it.
[01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:38.380]  So we'll hate maybe that one.
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.240]  We'll get rid of these.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:39.480]  Okay.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.920]  So far, we're looking at maybe the suit of armor.
[01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:42.560]  Very expensive.
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:43.540]  Benji.
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:44.360]  Not crazy.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:45.940]  Yeah.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:46.800]  Dr. Seuss cat in a hat.
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.560]  I'm against it.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.340]  There's already two minutes.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:49.040]  It's too much.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.380]  We're not going to get it.
[01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:50.840]  It's exciting.
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:51.200]  The timing.
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:51.620]  Yeah.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.160]  I would rather the battle rifle.
[01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:55.940]  Me too.
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:56.760]  Pistol.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:57.500]  No dice.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.260]  Battle rifle.
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:22:58.840]  I'm into.
[01:22:59.300 --> 01:22:59.900]  Got to have both.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:00.520]  Yeah.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:01.100]  I want both.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:03.480]  Okay.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:04.220]  Okay.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.820]  I think the pistol is more iconic because it's RVB-ish.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:07.500]  Yeah.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.140]  Yeah.
[01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:08.560]  That's fair.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:08.840]  Yeah.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:10.740]  Happy Gilmore.
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:11.520]  That's so cool.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:15.860]  Would you rather have the pistol or the battle rifle or the happy Gilmore stick?
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:16.940]  Pistol battle rifle.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.200]  Yes.
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:19.420]  I...
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:21.920]  That's a good question.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.580]  I owe my career to that pistol.
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:26.160]  But I like happy Gilmore more.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.280]  I love happy Gilmore.
[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:28.300]  Yeah.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.820]  But I do owe the last 22 years of my life to that exact pistol.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:35.620]  Now, I will...
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:36.980]  Let me float this out.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:41.320]  This is not like an actual movie prop.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.880]  Like, it's a re-created...
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.400]  But the advantage of that is, Geoff, you've had a lot of innovation autographing baseballs
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.420]  with a baseball bat.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:56.260]  Could there be some form of autographing with a happy Gilmore club that could be used?
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:58.720]  Well, I wouldn't want to mar it up, you know what I mean?
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.800]  Well, I mean, it's just, it's a...
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.420]  It's a replica of a thing from a movie.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:02.980]  Like, I don't...
[01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:03.500]  But is it...
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:05.380]  Was it made for the movie and not used?
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.400]  I don't think so, because he signed it.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:08.920]  Yeah, probably.
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:12.140]  I mean, there's a descriptor in the bottom right that would clarify all of this.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.260]  We're speculating, like, there is an info on what the product is.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:22.440]  I think this was just made to look like the one from the movie.
[01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:23.080]  This is not like that.
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:23.900]  Alright, well, let's lose it.
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:24.420]  Fuck it.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:24.720]  Okay.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.400]  Fun while it lasted.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.620]  I mean, it's cool to me, but it's just too much money.
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:33.260]  Yeah, too much.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:35.660]  Yeah, and it probably isn't even from the movie.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.280]  Meh.
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.320]  Once again, cool.
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:38.900]  We don't need it.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:39.460]  Meh.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:39.780]  Okay.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:43.320]  I mean, this is for me, and we don't need that.
[01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:44.340]  Don't worry about that one.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:44.720]  Okay.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:45.860]  We can ditch Major League.
[01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.180]  We already got Snake Eyes for you.
[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:48.140]  We already got Snake Eyes.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.180]  And Small Soldiers.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.440]  I really like it, but...
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.000]  I do too.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.060]  It's not from the movie.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.420]  But it's the same material.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.860]  But it's the same people that made it, and it's the same molds.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:24:59.720]  I don't...
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.200]  Okay.
[01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:01.300]  Okay.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.460]  It's not from the movie.
[01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:03.480]  Okay.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.420]  I mean, I agree with you, but also, like, of course, you're going to be the advocate
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.300]  for Small Soldiers.
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:09.740]  Absolutely.
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:15.740]  So I'm giving you a very songstralid solid fact to not get this.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:16.800]  Songstralid.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.280]  Songstralid.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:17.780]  Absolutely.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.760]  Nick, you and I, we need to go make another... we need to make another company all about
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.300]  Small Soldiers.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:24.600]  No, Nick.
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:28.020]  All Nick and Andrew have to do is convince either Gavin or I.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.260]  Yeah, let's vote on it.
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:29.580]  All right.
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.640]  I mean, you guys can vote on it.
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.040]  Go for it.
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:33.680]  Do you want to spend $8,000 on this thing that isn't from a movie?
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.200]  That's fine.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:36.100]  I'm just saying it's the same exact...
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:36.320]  Shut up.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:36.900]  It's the same...
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:37.260]  Hang on.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:37.340]  Hang on.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.860]  It's the same exact logic you just used to not buy the Happy Gilmore thing, which was
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:42.840]  more than half the price.
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.220]  Well, the Happy Gilmore thing was autographed.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:46.940]  And it's stralid.
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:50.280]  It's song and stralid, and I'm right.
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:53.240]  So if you guys want to make that decision, that's fine.
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.660]  I'm just letting you know, factually based.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.480]  What you just decided for the other thing is why you shouldn't buy this.
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:00.340]  Yeah, but that was different.
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:01.600]  Yeah.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.380]  That was different.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.920]  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, but that's fine.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.560]  I got a problem with this.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.180]  It is, but I don't want this, ultimately.
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:07.440]  Okay.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:07.880]  All right.
[01:26:08.180 --> 01:26:09.200]  I don't want it either.
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:10.340]  As much as...
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.620]  But not because Eric convinced me.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:12.140]  Good.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:12.180]  He's gone.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:12.720]  No.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.620]  Eric didn't convince me at all.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:14.880]  No.
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:15.240]  Yeah.
[01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.980]  If anything, he made my stance stronger, but then I backed on my own.
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:20.600]  Snake Eye stuff locked in.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.140]  So we're looking at Halo, Halo, Benji, Pink Panther.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.740]  I say we ditch Pink Panther.
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:27.740]  Okay.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:28.500]  Ooh.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:29.640]  Okay.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.020]  They aren't for that, Gavin.
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.180]  I would rather Pink Panther than either of the Halo things.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.200]  Oh, I disagree.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.000]  I don't know why we have to ditch any of it.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:45.060]  Chances are, we're not going to bid on it, but we can at least watch and see, you know?
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.960]  Are you sure you don't want to go after that crow?
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:49.840]  I mean, I... yeah.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:50.960]  How much was it?
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.360]  It's like $4,000.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.180]  Like $10K, $5K to $10K?
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:53.840]  Hmm.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:54.380]  Ugh.
[01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:57.500]  The crow would be really cool.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.240]  I mean, what are we going to do with it?
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.460]  I guess we would use it.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.680]  We'd use it for watch-alongs.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.180]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:08.120]  The idea that any of this stuff that we buy, we, you know, hopefully we recoup some of
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:09.680]  the cost in some way.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:11.920]  Huh.
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:12.400]  Hmm.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.500]  I mean, you could always sell them back to the prop store.
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:19.080]  I think that's one way to recoup some of the cost.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:23.740]  I guess the problem, though, is we're hoping we're the only ones who want to buy the thing.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.560]  So then putting it into the market where we're the only ones who buy the thing is very funny.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:34.180]  I hope there's another me this time that isn't me.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:36.320]  I mean, you're right.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.060]  It doesn't have to be necessarily either or.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:38.940]  Yeah.
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:39.660]  Yeah.
[01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:45.620]  But, like, I, this is probably a one bid thing.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:46.940]  Oh, sure.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.460]  But I mean, we're not going to, when do we start bidding?
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:51.640]  When it's live.
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.440]  I guess you already did.
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:53.860]  You did your pre-bid.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.380]  We could bid now if we wanted.
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.620]  When does it go live?
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.360]  Uh, this will be lot 259, will it say maybe on the right what day that is?
[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.000]  It says bidding will end on the 15th.
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.940]  So yeah, that'll be on Thursday.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:12.940]  So whenever, I would just say, because it sounds like I won't be here for it, but whenever
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:19.180]  y'all record the process, I mean, you're probably only going to bid on one thing, and it might
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:21.880]  already be the Snake Eyes thing, but it'd be fun to watch the other stuff while you're
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:22.180]  doing it.
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.720]  Well, the Snake Eyes thing is at the end.
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:26.020]  So like, we're locked into Snake Eyes at the end.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:27.740]  This is like additional front stuff.
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:28.360]  Hmm.
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.920]  Well, I won't be there, so I guess it doesn't really matter, but I wouldn't want to eliminate
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.880]  options for just interest wise.
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:35.960]  Are you out next week?
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:39.040]  I'm out on the 17th or whatever that was.
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.780]  Yeah, this is the 14th or 15th, you just said.
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:42.780]  This is on Thursday.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.960]  This is this upcoming Thursday during the day.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:46.360]  He's out.
[01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:47.100]  I'm out.
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:50.620]  That's unfortunate.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:53.820]  I'm out Thursday to Sunday.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:55.360]  Oh man.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.740]  It's like the range of this option.
[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:05.970]  Well, do we want to leave these as is and evaluate as they come up?
[01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:07.510]  Do we want to make any other cuts?
[01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:10.990]  No, I think I think these are fine if we want to keep an eye on them.
[01:29:12.370 --> 01:29:16.370]  You know, I don't I don't particularly care about the Halo stuff, but I'm just not a Halo
[01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.590]  guy.
[01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:17.550]  So it's that's just me.
[01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.130]  But I understand why you guys are into it.
[01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:25.830]  So I'm all for getting the Halo stuff because you guys were all very like way, way into
[01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:26.030]  it.
[01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:31.050]  I think it's very cool, but I honestly think out of everything we have, it's either the
[01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:32.330]  Pink Panther suit or Benji.
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:36.690]  I mean, I guess I'm not going to I'm not going to be there for it.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:39.950]  But ultimately, my decision would probably be to go for whatever looked cheapest.
[01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:43.830]  I think that would be Benji.
[01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:44.630]  I think that would be Benji.
[01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:45.270]  I don't think.
[01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.610]  Yeah.
[01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:50.870]  Well, the Halo battle rifles, like the same as Benji, but there but there is interest
[01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:51.350]  on those.
[01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:52.590]  There's already three bits.
[01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:53.390]  And it's weird.
[01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:54.410]  There are no bids.
[01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:57.550]  There's no bids on Benji, guys.
[01:29:57.930 --> 01:30:00.010]  See nobody bid on the tuxedo, but us.
[01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.810]  I feel like our market is the thing that nobody else wants.
[01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.510]  Yeah.
[01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:08.710]  I mean, this is this is you putting bids in, which is great because no one else is going
[01:30:08.710 --> 01:30:09.110]  to do it.
[01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:14.790]  These are this is stuff people want Benji nobody wants, which is sad.
[01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:20.150]  When we watch the Snake Eyes thing go through, you are going to lose your mind as someone
[01:30:20.150 --> 01:30:24.970]  who's went through with the tuxedo, just yelling, close the bidding, stop, stop, just
[01:30:24.970 --> 01:30:25.450]  close it.
[01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:26.230]  Just end it.
[01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.730]  End it.
[01:30:26.870 --> 01:30:27.130]  Move.
[01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:27.690]  Move.
[01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:29.110]  It is so stressful.
[01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:32.210]  But I'm so excited that we went through this.
[01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:34.330]  I love that we're already locked in on Snake Eyes.
[01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:40.590]  We should do a watch along of Snake Eyes as well as let's record the auction for that.
[01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:42.510]  Let's let's record it going through.
[01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:43.390]  That is.
[01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:45.070]  That's disconcerting.
[01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:48.990]  That's an adorable little puppy dog right there.
[01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:49.470]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:51.290]  That's a cute little dog we got.
[01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:52.410]  Our dog.
[01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:56.550]  Andrew, go ahead and do the outro.
[01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:57.770]  Oh, no.
[01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:59.250]  He's wagging his tail.
[01:30:59.590 --> 01:31:00.410]  He had so much fun.
[01:31:01.410 --> 01:31:05.050]  Benji's having a great time, just like I did looking at all those props.
[01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:07.090]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:09.790]  I hope you carry with us forward.
[01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:13.030]  Those were a weird combination of words as we do more auction stuff.
[01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:14.310]  I'm excited.
[01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:15.610]  I'm hoping we get Snake Eyes.

[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.440]  Nailed it.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:32.840]  Silence.
[01:31:33.820 --> 01:31:34.720]  We all good?
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:35.860]  Benji.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:37.560]  Bye.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:37.980]  Bye.
[01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:38.220]  Bye.
[01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:38.860]  Bye.
