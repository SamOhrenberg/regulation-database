[00:00.000 --> 00:04.540]  Hello and welcome to the movie battle of 2025.
[00:04.980 --> 00:06.960]  We are back once again.
[00:07.080 --> 00:12.500]  Your champion, your grand champion here to introduce Mr.
[00:13.020 --> 00:16.420]  Twisters himself in the battle.
[00:17.080 --> 00:18.340]  We're back once again.
[00:18.400 --> 00:21.980]  We have the list of summer films we're going to do an auction.
[00:22.220 --> 00:23.800]  We each have 98 points.
[00:24.120 --> 00:26.820]  We will run through each movie, bid on them.
[00:27.160 --> 00:29.480]  Then once you have all the movies that you compiled,
[00:29.480 --> 00:32.360]  we total the domestics across the summer.
[00:32.780 --> 00:36.920]  Whoever makes the most money with the movies they own wins the battle.
[00:38.140 --> 00:41.020]  There was some confusion last year, but then we got it.
[00:41.060 --> 00:42.560]  It went really well.
[00:42.580 --> 00:44.760]  I would say I had a lot of fun with it as the winner.
[00:44.980 --> 00:46.600]  Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.960]  The audience really liked it. It was a lot of fun.
[00:49.060 --> 00:53.200]  I think before we start, we should talk about the terms
[00:53.200 --> 00:55.020]  of where this starts and where it ends.
[00:55.020 --> 00:57.540]  Like, what's our begin date and what's our cutoff date?
[00:57.540 --> 01:01.380]  May 1st, I believe, is our start.
[01:01.720 --> 01:04.720]  And then we end, I believe, September 1st.
[01:04.900 --> 01:06.620]  Last year, we went end of September.
[01:07.160 --> 01:09.640]  We could go into September again if we want.
[01:10.160 --> 01:12.140]  I think the last film comes out end of August.
[01:12.260 --> 01:13.500]  So maybe we go end of September.
[01:13.840 --> 01:14.900]  So first day of October.
[01:15.240 --> 01:18.520]  So did none of these movies come out earlier than the May 1st?
[01:18.520 --> 01:21.640]  No. That's a five month window to wait, though.
[01:21.960 --> 01:23.360]  Pretty meaty time. Yeah.
[01:23.620 --> 01:25.500]  Didn't we do it longer last time?
[01:25.720 --> 01:27.100]  I know we started late last year,
[01:27.100 --> 01:27.960]  but maybe we didn't.
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.320]  Oh, we started like a week late, but it really was essentially
[01:31.320 --> 01:33.100]  the same time period. It went by quick.
[01:33.240 --> 01:34.120]  All right. Let's do it.
[01:34.300 --> 01:35.080]  Here's the thing.
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.820]  In New York, New York, fall will officially start on September 22nd.
[01:39.860 --> 01:41.980]  Oh, there you go. There you go.
[01:42.840 --> 01:43.760]  Well, we live in Austin.
[01:44.360 --> 01:45.620]  Summer lasts about eight months.
[01:45.900 --> 01:47.400]  Oh, that's true. OK, hang on.
[01:47.660 --> 01:51.200]  When does fall start in Austin, Texas?
[01:51.400 --> 01:54.440]  Let me find out. December 17th. Monday.
[01:54.440 --> 01:55.460]  Hang on. September.
[01:55.680 --> 01:56.980]  It is the 22nd.
[01:57.120 --> 02:00.480]  So that will be I think maybe that's I think maybe that's it.
[02:00.520 --> 02:02.860]  Maybe that's when the official end of this will be.
[02:02.960 --> 02:04.340]  It'd be September 22nd.
[02:04.340 --> 02:07.260]  No more past the 21st, the 22nd, the official last day.
[02:07.700 --> 02:08.460]  I'm OK with that.
[02:08.520 --> 02:11.400]  They're making another Jurassic World movie.
[02:11.840 --> 02:13.340]  How have you not seen the trailer for that?
[02:13.500 --> 02:14.920]  It's it's a video game.
[02:14.980 --> 02:15.580]  It's so crazy.
[02:15.580 --> 02:16.660]  Kind of a reboot.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.220]  Yeah, it is.
[02:18.620 --> 02:19.280]  They keep going.
[02:19.380 --> 02:21.780]  Those other ones aren't important, dude.
[02:21.860 --> 02:24.200]  This one, this one's for the fans.
[02:24.440 --> 02:25.300]  Isn't this one?
[02:25.420 --> 02:29.200]  There's like another island, but this island has all the like criminal,
[02:29.340 --> 02:33.800]  like evil dinosaurs that are just the ones that were too dangerous.
[02:33.800 --> 02:35.740]  It's like the Arkham Asylum for dinosaurs.
[02:36.540 --> 02:37.420]  Australia dinosaurs.
[02:37.940 --> 02:41.280]  Let me tell you that I'm so excited for the plot of this
[02:41.280 --> 02:43.840]  because people can't wait to see it, which is insane.
[02:44.000 --> 02:44.860]  It is guys.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.260]  There's a secret island where all the worst dinosaurs are.
[02:48.380 --> 02:48.640]  Hell yeah.
[02:48.640 --> 02:49.920]  Why didn't you kill them? Whatever.
[02:49.920 --> 02:55.180]  But in order for us to get some kind of cure for something,
[02:55.180 --> 02:58.980]  we have to go to this secret island and collect DNA
[02:59.560 --> 03:04.540]  from the land dinosaur, the water dinosaur in the air.
[03:04.620 --> 03:05.380]  That's awesome.
[03:05.500 --> 03:08.000]  Like, like it is a Playstation 2 game.
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.860]  That's great. Awesome.
[03:10.380 --> 03:12.360]  I cannot believe they made this movie.
[03:12.540 --> 03:15.340]  Why do they keep it's the Raptors and the T-Rex.
[03:15.420 --> 03:16.280]  That's what people like.
[03:16.480 --> 03:18.000]  And they keep being like, no, no, no. Bigger.
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.460]  But what if we invent newer, crazier dinosaurs?
[03:20.780 --> 03:23.100]  Yeah. What an absolute shower of shit.
[03:23.200 --> 03:25.620]  I can't wait to put 98 points on that movie.
[03:25.740 --> 03:26.440]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:27.540 --> 03:32.360]  Well, we speaking of 98 points, we all have 98 points to bid here.
[03:32.740 --> 03:36.700]  So last time we did this, I think we took some really big swings
[03:36.700 --> 03:39.080]  on stuff like Minions and Deadpool.
[03:39.560 --> 03:45.780]  However, this run of movies here is like, this is crazy.
[03:45.780 --> 03:52.320]  There's so many big, big, big movies that if you don't get one of them,
[03:52.500 --> 03:57.000]  maybe you get one of the other ones, because, dude, there's some huge ones in here.
[03:57.320 --> 03:58.300]  I'm really curious.
[03:58.420 --> 04:01.540]  We have, what is that, 39 movies to choose from?
[04:02.020 --> 04:04.900]  So let's get started.
[04:05.280 --> 04:11.320]  Well, we start with a very divisive film on the list of how we want to approach it.
[04:11.320 --> 04:16.860]  Uh, Horizon and American Saga, chapter two, not scheduled.
[04:17.280 --> 04:20.940]  Now, we did have a fight on the podcast, a fight, maybe strong word.
[04:21.820 --> 04:25.800]  Gavin had it last year, last battle didn't come out.
[04:25.900 --> 04:29.080]  It got pushed out of the schedule and he wanted to back in.
[04:29.440 --> 04:31.820]  We made a compromise at the time that he could bid on it
[04:31.820 --> 04:32.840]  and then it goes into the pool.
[04:33.140 --> 04:34.940]  How are you feeling today about this, Gavin?
[04:35.220 --> 04:36.840]  Feel great. I get first refusal, right?
[04:37.060 --> 04:40.520]  You do. I don't think any of us want it, though.
[04:40.520 --> 04:41.720]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:41.900 --> 04:44.520]  So, yeah, but for a price, it's not scheduled to come out.
[04:44.820 --> 04:48.220]  Yeah, but if I put one on it, are you saying no one else will bid too?
[04:48.380 --> 04:48.680]  You have to put six.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.760]  One way to find out. It's up to you.
[04:50.880 --> 04:53.300]  But I also like that it's copied and pasted from the last thing.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.880]  Horizon and American Saga, chapter two, box office mojo.
[04:56.260 --> 04:56.460]  Yep.
[05:00.220 --> 05:03.680]  That's that's the tender, loving care that we put into the movie auction.
[05:05.060 --> 05:09.080]  So right of first refusal, Gavin, are you going to put any points on this?
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.440]  Don't want it. Couldn't care less.
[05:11.000 --> 05:17.480]  Yay. OK, so now do we drop it or does it run up for bid for everybody?
[05:18.020 --> 05:19.020]  I think it's open to anyone.
[05:19.500 --> 05:21.520]  One. Eric has one.
[05:24.040 --> 05:27.080]  Going once, going twice.
[05:28.360 --> 05:31.980]  Sold to Eric for one whole point.
[05:32.320 --> 05:34.420]  I'll take it for one. Nobody, nobody wants it.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.720]  I'll take it. That's fine.
[05:35.760 --> 05:36.780]  Who's going to buy it next year?
[05:36.780 --> 05:39.620]  I like that we had that huge, huge hockey one on the podcast.
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.120]  Couldn't give a shit about that movie.
[05:41.280 --> 05:41.880]  Of course not.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.920]  Andrew, are you adjusting the owner?
[05:46.280 --> 05:49.400]  I'm trying. It's not letting me hear. One second. Let me refresh it.
[05:49.980 --> 05:52.360]  Congratulations, Eric, being the first person on the board.
[05:52.500 --> 05:56.500]  Thank you. I you know, it's important to me to get on the board early,
[05:56.600 --> 05:57.640]  get on the board often.
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.080]  I just don't know how you're going to win Jurassic World Rebirth with 97 points.
[06:02.520 --> 06:03.720]  I don't know.
[06:03.780 --> 06:06.660]  But also it's not it's not even ticking me down here anyway.
[06:06.660 --> 06:07.920]  So maybe I'm just OK.
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.800]  There's so many movies I want to target. One.
[06:13.660 --> 06:15.100]  Nope. Andrew, thoughts?
[06:16.160 --> 06:17.480]  Why is nothing working?
[06:17.660 --> 06:18.840]  Why is nothing working for me?
[06:19.100 --> 06:21.320]  Everything breaks. Everything's always breaking.
[06:21.860 --> 06:22.560]  It's my fault.
[06:23.100 --> 06:25.620]  Throw up the technical difficulty screen, Nick. Hang on.
[06:26.460 --> 06:27.820]  Different account. That's fine. Got it.
[06:27.920 --> 06:29.680]  Cool. All right. Cut that.
[06:30.020 --> 06:31.460]  Yeah. Yeah. That's what I just said.
[06:31.620 --> 06:33.320]  I said, throw up the technical difficulty screen.
[06:33.660 --> 06:35.580]  He did say that. I don't have that.
[06:35.580 --> 06:37.760]  Why is nothing working to that?
[06:39.260 --> 06:40.400]  I have a difficulty.
[06:42.140 --> 06:44.020]  I don't know what any of these cells are supposed to do.
[06:44.660 --> 06:47.480]  None of them. None of them have any equations.
[06:47.780 --> 06:48.740]  Logic to them.
[06:49.080 --> 06:49.180]  Nope.
[06:50.040 --> 06:51.380]  It's just a flat file.
[06:52.320 --> 06:52.580]  Yeah.
[06:53.860 --> 06:55.200]  Grid. It's just a grid.
[06:56.200 --> 06:57.480]  How did... one sec.
[06:57.500 --> 06:58.580]  I'm looking at the last one.
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.440]  They just have raw numbers in it.
[07:00.840 --> 07:02.120]  Yeah, it's just some numbers.
[07:03.640 --> 07:03.940]  One.
[07:03.940 --> 07:05.640]  That worked.
[07:07.580 --> 07:08.760]  Okay, so that works.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  Right, but it's not associated to anything.
[07:12.560 --> 07:13.120]  Here we go.
[07:13.680 --> 07:15.220]  I have a second... one second.
[07:15.720 --> 07:16.440]  I have a second one second.
[07:16.580 --> 07:17.420]  You have a backup sheet?
[07:17.720 --> 07:19.780]  I have a backup sheet and it works.
[07:21.100 --> 07:21.380]  Link it.
[07:21.820 --> 07:23.720]  It's a good opportunity to look at some of these movies.
[07:27.500 --> 07:29.620]  Just want to hit that copy button. There you go.
[07:29.780 --> 07:31.440]  And then come right over to Discord.
[07:31.860 --> 07:33.240]  Drop it in. Paste it.
[07:33.240 --> 07:34.080]  I'm aware.
[07:34.220 --> 07:36.460]  Hit that... slam that enter button one time.
[07:36.800 --> 07:37.500]  Yep, there you go.
[07:38.760 --> 07:39.560]  You need access.
[07:43.980 --> 07:45.680]  One sec. One sec.
[07:46.140 --> 07:46.400]  Yeah.
[07:46.760 --> 07:47.680]  Oh, man.
[07:48.260 --> 07:50.360]  Don't give access, though. Just make it public.
[07:54.400 --> 07:56.580]  There you go. He made it public.
[07:57.820 --> 08:00.920]  Okay, so if we say... let me get this.
[08:01.300 --> 08:02.900]  This is view only.
[08:04.260 --> 08:07.500]  So go ahead and change that access there.
[08:09.240 --> 08:10.160]  It's view only.
[08:10.440 --> 08:12.940]  You want to change that from view only to edit.
[08:13.520 --> 08:14.360]  Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[08:15.360 --> 08:16.660]  I'm doing multiple things here.
[08:17.320 --> 08:18.460]  It should just be one.
[08:19.340 --> 08:20.640]  We'll make it one video.
[08:21.400 --> 08:23.820]  Yep, but I'm modifying the list.
[08:24.880 --> 08:25.860]  Checking it twice.
[08:26.520 --> 08:32.840]  This got broken last night because there were some movies that have been canceled and or moved that got edited out.
[08:32.840 --> 08:35.040]  Oh, these are different. This is a different list.
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.300]  Yeah, well, there's a few extra.
[08:37.840 --> 08:39.660]  We're seeing on the fly adjustments. I like this.
[08:39.980 --> 08:40.120]  Yep.
[08:41.120 --> 08:42.340]  This has been updated.
[08:44.080 --> 08:44.960]  Okay, so...
[08:44.960 --> 08:47.500]  There we go. Now we're all good.
[08:47.740 --> 08:48.220]  We're back.
[08:48.680 --> 08:50.340]  It didn't deduct anything.
[08:51.000 --> 08:52.120]  Are we ready for the next film?
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.100]  It didn't deduct.
[08:53.360 --> 08:55.940]  I'm not sure what we are saying that he's not hearing.
[08:56.340 --> 08:57.620]  Oh, it didn't remove anything?
[08:59.200 --> 08:59.920]  That's unfortunate.
[08:59.940 --> 09:02.160]  What were you basing the it's working on?
[09:02.900 --> 09:05.960]  I was just really excited that the owner box now works.
[09:07.400 --> 09:10.060]  The owner box worked fine. I was doing it.
[09:12.320 --> 09:14.640]  Well, that deducted. When you put it in there, it deducted it.
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.540]  Yes, absolutely. And so I'll just have to do that, I guess.
[09:18.120 --> 09:19.900]  I don't know if we can trust you to do that every time.
[09:20.280 --> 09:26.100]  You can keep an eye on it and you can let me know. Gavin, also check it out. You can click on that link and Gavin can do it.
[09:26.400 --> 09:26.920]  That's a good point.
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.000]  Any thoughts?
[09:28.260 --> 09:29.420]  I'm not really an Excel guy.
[09:29.420 --> 09:33.700]  Yeah, yeah. So just keep a fucking eye on it, I guess.
[09:35.500 --> 09:36.980]  Are we ready for the next film?
[09:37.300 --> 09:41.460]  That's the most Gavin thing. Hey, this video is out. I have some ideas for some changes.
[09:41.700 --> 09:41.920]  What?
[09:42.920 --> 09:44.140]  Is this video out already?
[09:44.660 --> 09:45.320]  Oh, my God.
[09:47.960 --> 09:49.220]  We'll be when they hear it.
[09:49.680 --> 09:52.880]  Hey, we're back. The sheet is fixed. Not really.
[09:53.100 --> 09:56.160]  But, guys, we're moving on to the next movie. I now own one.
[09:56.220 --> 09:58.660]  The next movie, Shadow Force.
[10:00.140 --> 10:04.880]  It's an action movie. Shadow Force, go on one. It has Method Man in it.
[10:05.380 --> 10:06.440]  Oh, Method Man?
[10:06.660 --> 10:09.560]  Method Man's in it. Joe Carnahan film.
[10:09.980 --> 10:10.540]  One, why not?
[10:10.880 --> 10:11.720]  Nick has one.
[10:12.160 --> 10:12.560]  There you go.
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.500]  It's an early May release. Anybody want to go more than one?
[10:17.120 --> 10:17.780]  Absolutely not.
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.320]  One going once. One going twice. Honestly, one is a great deal.
[10:22.960 --> 10:24.920]  Sold to Nick for one.
[10:25.940 --> 10:27.780]  Eric, if you want, I can handle the left.
[10:28.300 --> 10:28.420]  Sure.
[10:28.420 --> 10:31.160]  If it was a great deal, why didn't you bid?
[10:31.800 --> 10:37.140]  Because I just, I didn't, I felt like I shouldn't. As I said it, I felt like, you know, I don't know.
[10:37.520 --> 10:39.900]  I'm counting down. I felt like that would be a jerk move in that moment.
[10:40.220 --> 10:44.120]  I didn't want it that much, but if you can get a movie for one, that'll probably make like 30, 40 million.
[10:44.640 --> 10:45.000]  At least.
[10:45.300 --> 10:46.440]  Yeah. That's a little something.
[10:46.640 --> 10:48.400]  That's solid. You need that.
[10:48.500 --> 10:49.580]  A little walking around money.
[10:49.920 --> 10:53.220]  Moving on. The first big film.
[10:54.220 --> 10:54.940]  What's Thunderbolts?
[10:55.280 --> 10:56.540]  Honestly, do you think so?
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.360]  Marvel thinks so.
[10:58.360 --> 11:00.820]  No, Marvel certainly hopes so. They need it to be big.
[11:01.780 --> 11:08.040]  Other recent movies, I feel like this one actually, aside from Deadpool and Wolverine, has the potential to be decent.
[11:10.400 --> 11:12.380]  Decent is sort of where we're at.
[11:12.660 --> 11:12.840]  One.
[11:13.460 --> 11:14.580]  I'll go two.
[11:15.380 --> 11:15.880]  Three.
[11:16.900 --> 11:17.180]  Four.
[11:17.760 --> 11:18.720]  I'll go six.
[11:19.300 --> 11:19.580]  Wow.
[11:19.640 --> 11:19.900]  Seven.
[11:20.360 --> 11:20.800]  Oh, wow.
[11:21.100 --> 11:21.160]  Eight.
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.340]  Andrew going eight with Thunderbolts.
[11:23.760 --> 11:24.540]  All right, nine.
[11:25.200 --> 11:25.700]  Wow.
[11:25.880 --> 11:26.380]  Nine.
[11:27.400 --> 11:29.040]  What don't I know about this?
[11:29.700 --> 11:30.600]  Florence Pugh.
[11:30.620 --> 11:31.060]  Everything, apparently.
[11:32.040 --> 11:32.960]  I'll go ten.
[11:33.520 --> 11:36.800]  We said here's Thunderbolts and you said what's Thunderbolts.
[11:37.460 --> 11:37.900]  Eleven.
[11:39.060 --> 11:40.700]  I mean, Florence Pugh's a big name.
[11:41.580 --> 11:43.240]  David Harbour is in it as well.
[11:43.680 --> 11:44.400]  Bucky's in it.
[11:44.800 --> 11:45.440]  I'll go twelve.
[11:46.160 --> 11:46.600]  Wow.
[11:47.200 --> 11:48.540]  Damn, do I need to get in on this?
[11:48.920 --> 11:49.140]  Thirteen.
[11:49.380 --> 11:50.120]  Yeah, jump on.
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.720]  Go, Gavin, do it.
[11:52.160 --> 11:52.600]  Fourteen.
[11:52.880 --> 11:54.340]  You can have my spot. I'm stepping out.
[11:55.080 --> 11:55.560]  Wow.
[11:55.760 --> 11:56.880]  Fourteen to Andrew.
[12:00.850 --> 12:01.330]  Fifteen.
[12:02.030 --> 12:02.510]  Wow.
[12:03.470 --> 12:03.950]  Wow.
[12:04.110 --> 12:04.390]  I'm out.
[12:04.470 --> 12:05.470]  I'm out on fifteen.
[12:06.170 --> 12:07.350]  Fifteen going one.
[12:07.930 --> 12:08.210]  Okay.
[12:08.730 --> 12:10.370]  Fifteen going twice.
[12:11.710 --> 12:14.370]  Congratulations, Nick, you have Thunderbolts.
[12:14.770 --> 12:15.230]  There it is.
[12:15.230 --> 12:16.630]  Oh, I'm having flashbacks to last year.
[12:16.790 --> 12:18.230]  That might be a bargain.
[12:18.550 --> 12:19.130]  It could be.
[12:19.290 --> 12:21.950]  I don't think it's a bad move.
[12:23.530 --> 12:26.010]  No, but this hurt me last year, too, you know.
[12:26.190 --> 12:26.550]  It did.
[12:26.550 --> 12:27.790]  It's such a question mark.
[12:28.170 --> 12:32.990]  It's going to be interesting this season because there's so many different movies that are
[12:32.990 --> 12:34.230]  worth spending money on.
[12:34.570 --> 12:38.630]  I think a lot of really good stuff is going to go for a lot less because we're just going
[12:38.630 --> 12:41.170]  to have to be more judicious with our points.
[12:41.570 --> 12:41.850]  Yes.
[12:42.590 --> 12:44.770]  Next film on the list is Magic Farm.
[12:45.230 --> 12:46.270]  All right, Gavin, what do you want to throw?
[12:46.310 --> 12:47.330]  Fifteen on this one or what?
[12:48.050 --> 12:48.670]  Magic Farm.
[12:49.190 --> 12:52.390]  A media crew mistakenly ends up in the wrong country while trying to profile a musician
[12:52.390 --> 12:57.210]  as they collaborate with locals to create a viral trend relationships form amid an unfolding
[12:57.210 --> 12:58.210]  health crisis.
[12:58.910 --> 12:59.370]  What the fuck?
[12:59.430 --> 13:01.090]  There's so many things happening in that movie.
[13:01.190 --> 13:02.670]  It's a magic farm, Nick.
[13:03.310 --> 13:05.030]  It's also 93 minutes, though.
[13:05.310 --> 13:05.510]  Yeah.
[13:05.730 --> 13:06.450]  Good run time.
[13:06.530 --> 13:06.950]  You know what?
[13:07.370 --> 13:10.690]  I'm going to say one because I think it has Chloe Sevigny in it.
[13:11.070 --> 13:11.630]  She does.
[13:12.150 --> 13:13.210]  Is that how you say her name?
[13:13.230 --> 13:13.710]  She does.
[13:14.010 --> 13:14.490]  She does.
[13:14.710 --> 13:16.110]  I think Chloe Sevigny's in it.
[13:16.110 --> 13:16.710]  She does.
[13:16.770 --> 13:17.170]  She does.
[13:19.330 --> 13:21.630]  Is that how you say her last name?
[13:22.110 --> 13:22.590]  Yeah.
[13:23.810 --> 13:28.950]  Andrew, if you look at it, it is pronounced the way it's spelled.
[13:29.230 --> 13:30.210]  How have you been saying it?
[13:30.270 --> 13:31.330]  I always thought it was Sevigny.
[13:31.810 --> 13:33.490]  Oh, that sounds cool.
[13:33.670 --> 13:34.850]  That does sound cool.
[13:34.890 --> 13:36.750]  I'm sure she appreciates the upgrade.
[13:38.510 --> 13:39.390]  Chloe Sevigny.
[13:39.990 --> 13:42.950]  Eric with one point on Chloe Sevigny.
[13:43.570 --> 13:44.050]  Two.
[13:44.470 --> 13:45.390]  Nick just said two?
[13:45.770 --> 13:48.010]  Nick with two points on Magic Farm.
[13:48.370 --> 13:50.410]  You a big Sevigny head or what?
[13:50.410 --> 13:54.770]  Nick wants to own the entire weekend of May 1st or whatever.
[13:54.890 --> 13:57.630]  The first weekend is all Nick against him.
[13:57.990 --> 13:59.510]  I'm going for time here.
[13:59.630 --> 14:01.070]  Nick with two going once.
[14:01.230 --> 14:02.270]  Did that happen last year?
[14:02.910 --> 14:04.490]  Nick loves Brown Bunny and kids.
[14:04.790 --> 14:05.930]  Two going twice.
[14:06.410 --> 14:06.650]  What?
[14:07.670 --> 14:08.590]  Magic Farm?
[14:08.670 --> 14:08.890]  What?
[14:09.290 --> 14:11.430]  Nick's really into early Harmony Corrine.
[14:12.270 --> 14:14.810]  Magic Farm sold to Nick with two.
[14:14.810 --> 14:15.090]  Wow!
[14:15.570 --> 14:16.670]  Nick, you got it too.
[14:17.170 --> 14:17.910]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[14:17.910 --> 14:22.410]  Are you concerned that your movies are coming out against each other or there's no concern there for you?
[14:22.710 --> 14:23.310]  I am now.
[14:23.390 --> 14:24.250]  Oh, okay.
[14:24.930 --> 14:25.490]  Cool.
[14:27.110 --> 14:31.750]  Next film is Friendship. A suburban dad falls hard for his charismatic new neighbor.
[14:32.030 --> 14:33.890]  It's a Paul Rudd movie.
[14:34.690 --> 14:35.190]  Two.
[14:35.870 --> 14:36.510]  I'll say two.
[14:36.870 --> 14:38.910]  I'll go six on that one.
[14:39.350 --> 14:39.770]  Wow.
[14:40.290 --> 14:40.790]  Six.
[14:42.330 --> 14:45.030]  Okay, well, six is going one here.
[14:45.890 --> 14:46.290]  Six.
[14:46.290 --> 14:48.450]  I think it's just going to be Geoff.
[14:48.550 --> 14:49.410]  Going twice.
[14:51.010 --> 14:52.550]  Sold to Geoff for six.
[14:52.930 --> 14:53.250]  Thank you.
[14:53.370 --> 14:57.090]  The early buzz on that movie is it is one of the funniest movies made in the last decade.
[14:57.230 --> 14:59.330]  It stars Tim Robinson, who's on top of the world right now.
[14:59.430 --> 15:02.110]  I have a pretty good feeling it's going to be like a $100 million comedy.
[15:02.890 --> 15:03.790]  Premiered in 2024.
[15:04.950 --> 15:07.230]  I don't think it's going to make that much.
[15:07.510 --> 15:11.390]  I think it'll make $20 million and people will really like it, but it's odd.
[15:11.530 --> 15:12.090]  I agree with that.
[15:12.310 --> 15:14.390]  I don't think people see comedies in the theater anymore.
[15:14.390 --> 15:16.550]  It seems like such a film festival movie.
[15:16.670 --> 15:20.330]  I know what you're saying, but I think it's coming out with not a lot around it except for Thunderbolts.
[15:20.390 --> 15:20.930]  I don't know.
[15:21.050 --> 15:22.070]  Tim Robinson is...
[15:22.070 --> 15:23.410]  Except for Thunderbolts!
[15:24.210 --> 15:28.210]  Except for... when was the last Marvel movie outside of Daredevil that... or not Daredevil.
[15:28.250 --> 15:28.730]  The other one.
[15:29.090 --> 15:29.990]  The other red guy.
[15:30.390 --> 15:31.170]  Here's the thing.
[15:31.510 --> 15:39.290]  The way to judge a lot of these is what theaters are showing it and the only Alamo theater showing it is South Lamar.
[15:39.410 --> 15:41.750]  There are no other Alamo theaters showing it in Austin.
[15:42.150 --> 15:42.730]  That's a good point.
[15:42.730 --> 15:47.570]  That's like when a movie comes out and they show it down on Slaughter and all the way up at Lakeland.
[15:48.490 --> 15:51.990]  That seems like approaching research for a guy who said he didn't do any research.
[15:52.570 --> 15:52.850]  Yeah.
[15:53.930 --> 15:56.630]  Dude, I'm looking at what movies I want to see.
[15:56.750 --> 15:59.090]  I'm not looking at what movies are on this list.
[15:59.250 --> 16:00.730]  I'm looking at the Alamo, dude.
[16:00.790 --> 16:02.710]  I got the season pass, baby.
[16:02.830 --> 16:05.810]  So what I'm hearing is that you're going to go to this movie and give me some money.
[16:05.910 --> 16:06.410]  I appreciate that.
[16:07.290 --> 16:08.930]  I'll wait till it's on streaming.
[16:09.490 --> 16:10.130]  You know what?
[16:10.130 --> 16:12.630]  I did refuse last year to go to anybody else's movies.
[16:12.730 --> 16:14.510]  Despite interest.
[16:14.690 --> 16:16.510]  I'll probably hold that into this year.
[16:17.030 --> 16:19.790]  Next film, Fight or Flight starring Josh Hartnett.
[16:20.410 --> 16:26.250]  Mercenary takes on the job of tracking down a target on a plane but must protect her when they're surrounded by people trying to kill both of them.
[16:26.630 --> 16:28.010]  How many times is this movie going to come out?
[16:28.450 --> 16:29.150]  One point.
[16:29.910 --> 16:30.950]  Okay, two points.
[16:31.490 --> 16:32.850]  It's already been released internationally.
[16:33.530 --> 16:34.470]  You can have it for two.
[16:34.890 --> 16:35.870]  Going once with two.
[16:37.310 --> 16:38.750]  Going twice with two.
[16:39.750 --> 16:42.450]  I get Fight or Flight for two points.
[16:43.170 --> 16:44.270]  I'm so excited.
[16:44.550 --> 16:46.030]  That movie looks so much fun.
[16:46.370 --> 16:47.570]  It's such a dumb movie.
[16:47.850 --> 16:51.790]  But moving on to Not Golden, which was cancelled, which is a wild thing.
[16:52.670 --> 16:55.990]  The film of the summer, Clown in a Cornfield.
[16:57.030 --> 16:57.930]  Up for bid?
[16:59.350 --> 17:05.890]  A fading midwestern town in which Frendo the Clown, a symbol of bygone success, reemerges as a terrifying scourge.
[17:06.270 --> 17:08.650]  I'll put one point on Clown in a Cornfield.
[17:08.830 --> 17:10.250]  Pennywise is going to be pissed.
[17:10.250 --> 17:14.870]  Why is the horror movie coming out in like May or June?
[17:16.690 --> 17:18.510]  They want to get in on the Oscar buzz.
[17:18.970 --> 17:22.710]  Hey, by the way, just real fast, I should have 92 points.
[17:22.790 --> 17:25.770]  I have 98, just so we're not cheating there.
[17:26.230 --> 17:27.750]  Thanks. Gavin, where were you?
[17:28.450 --> 17:29.270]  Hey, what's up?
[17:30.110 --> 17:30.950]  Yeah, there you go.
[17:31.290 --> 17:33.510]  Clown in a Cornfield for one.
[17:33.690 --> 17:34.310]  Going once.
[17:34.590 --> 17:35.610]  I'll put two for it.
[17:36.030 --> 17:38.310]  Two going once.
[17:38.800 --> 17:39.570]  Going once.
[17:40.510 --> 17:41.550]  Two going two.
[17:42.130 --> 17:42.990]  She does.
[17:45.070 --> 17:47.050]  Sold to Geoff.
[17:48.010 --> 17:48.590]  Bargain.
[17:49.250 --> 17:49.930]  She does.
[17:50.650 --> 17:51.130]  Once.
[17:53.290 --> 17:57.670]  Hey guys, no worries, my measles vaccination is still active.
[17:58.110 --> 17:58.790]  Nice.
[18:01.250 --> 18:02.210]  You might need it.
[18:02.640 --> 18:03.930]  How old is it?
[18:04.410 --> 18:05.950]  I was born in 1975.
[18:09.050 --> 18:10.430]  Juliet and Romeo.
[18:10.430 --> 18:13.130]  Based on the real story that inspired Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.
[18:13.310 --> 18:15.370]  Follows the greatest love story of all time.
[18:15.730 --> 18:18.010]  Set as an original pop musical.
[18:18.890 --> 18:19.490]  Oh my god.
[18:20.610 --> 18:21.990]  I'll go one point.
[18:22.310 --> 18:23.650]  I'll say one.
[18:24.450 --> 18:25.350]  I already said one.
[18:25.670 --> 18:26.830]  I'll say two.
[18:29.770 --> 18:31.770]  Don't think it's going to do very well.
[18:31.950 --> 18:34.550]  Nothing about that Screams movie you should see.
[18:34.990 --> 18:36.770]  But I'll give it a shot.
[18:36.770 --> 18:38.550]  That was a true story?
[18:39.150 --> 18:41.290]  But Romeo and Juliet isn't the true story?
[18:41.670 --> 18:45.370]  Yeah, I mean, according to this lie that they're telling people, absolutely dude.
[18:45.470 --> 18:48.150]  Juliet and Romeo going two for Eric.
[18:48.690 --> 18:49.030]  Twice.
[18:51.070 --> 18:53.130]  Going three for Eric.
[18:53.770 --> 18:54.230]  There it is.
[18:54.490 --> 18:56.050]  Sold to Eric.
[18:56.330 --> 18:57.030]  Going three.
[18:58.710 --> 19:00.330]  It went all the way to three.
[19:01.070 --> 19:03.550]  It went all the way to three.
[19:03.550 --> 19:05.350]  You never know Eric, that could be...
[19:05.350 --> 19:07.010]  That could be something.
[19:07.890 --> 19:08.410]  It could.
[19:08.990 --> 19:11.190]  It could be like a Rock of Ages type thing.
[19:11.450 --> 19:17.690]  Or like the one with Adam Devine where all the ladies sing with Anna Kendrick.
[19:18.330 --> 19:20.390]  Oh yeah, pitch perfect.
[19:21.130 --> 19:23.530]  Oh, it could be like Romeo and Juliet from the 90s.
[19:23.630 --> 19:26.630]  I don't think it's going to be, but it could be.
[19:26.750 --> 19:30.190]  Well, let's hurry up tomorrow for Hurry Up Tomorrow.
[19:30.470 --> 19:35.330]  An insomniac musician encounters a mysterious stranger leading to a journey that challenges everything he knows about.
[19:36.230 --> 19:38.730]  It's a movie with The Weeknd in it.
[19:38.830 --> 19:40.170]  I'll put two down.
[19:40.650 --> 19:41.390]  Geoff with two.
[19:42.350 --> 19:43.830]  Geoff with two going once.
[19:44.490 --> 19:44.970]  Three.
[19:45.970 --> 19:47.190]  Eric with three.
[19:47.590 --> 19:49.010]  Eric with three going once.
[19:49.890 --> 19:50.770]  Going twice.
[19:51.970 --> 19:53.890]  Sold to Eric for three.
[19:54.890 --> 19:56.150]  Look at that, Gavin, does that look cool?
[19:56.250 --> 19:57.310]  One, two, three, does that look cool?
[19:57.670 --> 19:58.190]  Looks great.
[19:58.510 --> 20:00.750]  You're doing a bit.
[20:01.410 --> 20:04.110]  Next up, Final Destinations.
[20:04.670 --> 20:06.510]  This is wrong, right? I got this for two, right?
[20:07.050 --> 20:09.170]  That's because you said going three and you fucked yourself.
[20:12.370 --> 20:13.870]  Final Destination, Bloodlines.
[20:15.110 --> 20:16.690]  Next up on the list.
[20:17.050 --> 20:17.490]  One.
[20:18.050 --> 20:18.990]  Let me read the...
[20:19.550 --> 20:29.150]  Plagued by a recurring violent nightmare, a college student returns home to find the one person who can break the cycle and save her family from the horrific fate that inevitably awaits them.
[20:29.450 --> 20:30.370]  I'll go four.
[20:31.310 --> 20:31.790]  Five.
[20:32.290 --> 20:32.630]  Six.
[20:33.390 --> 20:33.870]  Seven.
[20:34.210 --> 20:35.130]  Eight.
[20:35.570 --> 20:36.250]  Nine.
[20:38.130 --> 20:39.490]  I'll go ten.
[20:40.210 --> 20:41.830]  Nick went ten.
[20:42.230 --> 20:42.750]  I'll go eleven.
[20:43.710 --> 20:44.730]  I'll go fourteen.
[20:46.170 --> 20:48.250]  Spice it up a little bit.
[20:48.590 --> 20:49.050]  Wow.
[20:52.950 --> 20:53.890]  Going once.
[20:55.470 --> 20:56.710]  Going twice.
[20:58.130 --> 21:00.670]  Sold to me for fourteen.
[21:01.130 --> 21:01.870]  Fourteen.
[21:02.930 --> 21:03.370]  Fourteen.
[21:04.350 --> 21:05.250]  Got him, Geoff. We got him.
[21:08.010 --> 21:09.450]  Geoff, Geoff, our plan's working.
[21:10.730 --> 21:15.450]  They met beforehand and were like, we are going to get Andrew above thirteen on Final Destination.
[21:16.610 --> 21:17.430]  Fuck him up.
[21:17.790 --> 21:25.230]  Next film is The Ruse. An in-home caregiver fears for her life after being assigned to a mysterious elderly patient in a remote seaside home.
[21:25.510 --> 21:25.730]  One.
[21:26.310 --> 21:27.150]  Nick with one.
[21:29.590 --> 21:31.030]  Nick with one going once.
[21:31.030 --> 21:32.650]  Go ahead and just lock that one in.
[21:32.830 --> 21:33.850]  Going twice.
[21:34.310 --> 21:37.050]  Nick's going to dregs it all the way to the finish line.
[21:37.710 --> 21:40.730]  Sold to Nick for one point.
[21:41.170 --> 21:42.090]  Going to dregs it.
[21:42.210 --> 21:44.170]  I think you're going to end up with quite a total here.
[21:45.370 --> 21:46.090]  The first...
[21:47.530 --> 21:50.090]  I mean, there could be some big hits. We don't know about Thunderbolts.
[21:50.230 --> 21:51.550]  We don't know about Julian Romeo.
[21:52.130 --> 21:53.570]  But the first established...
[21:53.570 --> 21:55.590]  We don't know about Clown in a cornfield.
[21:56.190 --> 21:56.790]  We don't.
[21:58.190 --> 21:58.790]  Massive hit.
[21:58.810 --> 21:59.230]  Geoff does.
[21:59.230 --> 22:01.330]  Mission Impossible, The Final Reckoning.
[22:01.790 --> 22:02.150]  One.
[22:02.710 --> 22:04.590]  I had a feeling. 13.
[22:05.410 --> 22:07.350]  Eric with 13. Nick, 14.
[22:08.190 --> 22:08.810]  16.
[22:09.330 --> 22:09.830]  18.
[22:10.730 --> 22:11.230]  19.
[22:13.670 --> 22:15.710]  I'll say 20. I'll go with 20.
[22:16.550 --> 22:18.330]  Eric with 20. Going once.
[22:19.830 --> 22:21.770]  Eric with 20. Going twice.
[22:22.210 --> 22:22.610]  21.
[22:25.570 --> 22:28.230]  No, Gavin got it in there before you did, Andrew.
[22:28.230 --> 22:29.050]  You sure did.
[22:30.090 --> 22:32.610]  Oh, that was you bidding? I thought you were just repeating what I was saying.
[22:33.690 --> 22:34.710]  We both did it.
[22:34.870 --> 22:35.890]  It was instant.
[22:36.670 --> 22:37.430]  I'll go 22.
[22:38.970 --> 22:39.450]  23.
[22:40.230 --> 22:41.430]  You're in again?
[22:42.610 --> 22:45.350]  I was never out, baby. I was buying my time.
[22:45.670 --> 22:47.610]  Yeah, he was sat in the shadows.
[22:48.950 --> 22:50.010]  I'll go 24.
[22:50.610 --> 22:51.090]  25.
[22:51.930 --> 22:52.410]  26.
[22:55.310 --> 22:55.790]  27.
[22:55.790 --> 22:55.930]  27.
[22:57.610 --> 22:59.970]  Nick being back in is hilarious.
[23:03.260 --> 23:04.650]  27. Going once.
[23:05.770 --> 23:06.630]  That's a bargain.
[23:07.150 --> 23:08.150]  7. Going twice.
[23:09.050 --> 23:09.510]  28.
[23:11.340 --> 23:11.790]  29.
[23:12.390 --> 23:14.390]  Where did you come from again?
[23:14.630 --> 23:17.150]  He keeps doing it.
[23:17.350 --> 23:18.510]  Nick is pure chaos.
[23:19.530 --> 23:21.690]  29. Going once.
[23:22.730 --> 23:24.610]  29. Going twice.
[23:26.390 --> 23:29.750]  Sold to Nick for 29 points.
[23:30.130 --> 23:31.050]  Congratulations, Nick.
[23:31.050 --> 23:32.110]  I think it's a really good pickup.
[23:32.350 --> 23:34.310]  That's an easy half bill, I reckon.
[23:34.910 --> 23:35.630]  That's a deal.
[23:36.170 --> 23:39.090]  He's got the double whammy of Thunderbolts and Mission Impossible.
[23:39.610 --> 23:42.210]  If that Marvel movie is a hit, it might already be over.
[23:43.230 --> 23:47.130]  Next up is Lilo and Stitch, the live action remake.
[23:47.670 --> 23:48.130]  15.
[23:49.830 --> 23:50.430]  15.
[23:51.010 --> 23:51.350]  16.
[23:52.090 --> 23:52.550]  17.
[23:52.550 --> 23:53.130]  20.
[23:54.070 --> 23:55.090]  21.
[23:55.710 --> 23:56.290]  25.
[23:56.910 --> 23:57.790]  29.
[24:07.650 --> 24:09.870]  29. Going once.
[24:10.470 --> 24:11.150]  I'll go 30.
[24:11.830 --> 24:12.850]  31.
[24:13.950 --> 24:15.610]  Who had it at 29?
[24:16.470 --> 24:17.630]  I did. Andrew?
[24:18.130 --> 24:18.490]  32.
[24:19.650 --> 24:22.270]  What the fuck is that?
[24:22.270 --> 24:26.970]  This is the craziest. What is up with everyone?
[24:27.850 --> 24:29.930]  Wasn't it at 31 before I said 32?
[24:30.330 --> 24:31.850]  Yeah, you just came out of nowhere.
[24:32.470 --> 24:35.170]  33. I'm wondering where you came from.
[24:35.410 --> 24:36.790]  He was biding his time.
[24:37.170 --> 24:39.970]  No, I was wondering where Andrew came from and then I found out.
[24:40.710 --> 24:40.930]  What?
[24:42.690 --> 24:44.330]  He's been here the whole time, man.
[24:45.430 --> 24:46.270]  Going with 33.
[24:47.810 --> 24:49.090]  Wait, who has 33?
[24:50.910 --> 24:54.530]  Open... kick the cats out and open a window, dude.
[24:56.550 --> 24:57.690]  35.
[24:58.970 --> 25:00.570]  35 going once.
[25:01.630 --> 25:02.770]  36.
[25:04.010 --> 25:05.090]  Is that 36?
[25:05.730 --> 25:06.870]  37.
[25:09.700 --> 25:11.590]  37 going once.
[25:12.970 --> 25:15.090]  37 going twice.
[25:15.530 --> 25:16.030]  38.
[25:16.930 --> 25:20.230]  You know you can bid before I say twice.
[25:20.870 --> 25:21.270]  39.
[25:24.010 --> 25:24.410]  39.
[25:27.950 --> 25:29.090]  39, bid before you bid.
[25:29.410 --> 25:30.890]  39 going once.
[25:32.510 --> 25:34.690]  Who's at... hang on, wait. Before you keep counting it down.
[25:34.870 --> 25:35.870]  Who's at 39?
[25:36.510 --> 25:37.190]  I'm at 39.
[25:38.930 --> 25:39.790]  You're at 39?
[25:39.990 --> 25:42.530]  Gavin, you're at 38. This is why I brought it up.
[25:42.530 --> 25:49.310]  No, Gavin said 38 and then Andrew started chastising him for waiting and while he was saying that, Gavin said 39 before Andrew got a chance.
[25:49.330 --> 25:51.330]  So early, he hadn't bid yet.
[25:51.410 --> 25:52.530]  Okay, he just bid again?
[25:52.710 --> 25:54.650]  Yeah, and he said I said it before you said once.
[25:54.930 --> 25:56.150]  You outbid yourself?
[25:56.570 --> 25:57.330]  Yeah, I outbid myself.
[25:58.530 --> 25:59.570]  It's irrelevant now.
[26:01.810 --> 26:03.270]  This is insane.
[26:04.090 --> 26:05.350]  40 going once.
[26:06.330 --> 26:07.290]  41, 42.
[26:08.410 --> 26:08.890]  Why?
[26:12.150 --> 26:14.530]  Gavin with 42 going once.
[26:16.670 --> 26:17.070]  Twice.
[26:19.290 --> 26:21.890]  Sold to Gavin for 42 points.
[26:22.470 --> 26:22.870]  Wow.
[26:23.590 --> 26:24.550]  That may have been a mistake.
[26:24.910 --> 26:26.190]  It looks like dog shit.
[26:26.410 --> 26:27.250]  Gavin is on the board.
[26:27.570 --> 26:30.730]  But it's Disney, there's no way it does not make money.
[26:30.830 --> 26:33.190]  Yeah, it's kids and that. Kids love the movies.
[26:33.970 --> 26:36.310]  I don't know, the new Snow White didn't do super well, did it?
[26:36.590 --> 26:37.490]  No, and it was terrible.
[26:38.110 --> 26:38.870]  It still made like 40 points.
[26:39.430 --> 26:40.590]  300 million or something, didn't it?
[26:40.610 --> 26:43.470]  Yeah, I don't know. Like, you guys are like, yeah, that movie sucked.
[26:43.610 --> 26:44.670]  I don't think that matters.
[26:45.010 --> 26:46.750]  That's totally irrelevant to what we're doing here.
[26:46.850 --> 26:48.290]  Eventually, they might get wise.
[26:48.730 --> 26:51.630]  I don't, I, dude, I don't think so, man.
[26:51.870 --> 26:53.550]  Next film is Bring Her Back.
[26:54.290 --> 26:58.390]  A brother and sister recover terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.
[26:59.030 --> 26:59.050]  One, two.
[26:59.270 --> 27:00.790]  Jake with one, two.
[27:01.650 --> 27:02.290]  For Eric.
[27:02.630 --> 27:05.530]  By the way, just so we're clear, it only made 84 million dollars, Snow White.
[27:05.970 --> 27:06.290]  Domestic?
[27:07.050 --> 27:07.230]  Yeah.
[27:07.810 --> 27:08.210]  Wow.
[27:09.030 --> 27:10.950]  Lilo and Stitch looks good, though.
[27:11.230 --> 27:11.510]  Bad.
[27:11.790 --> 27:12.210]  No, it doesn't.
[27:12.270 --> 27:12.710]  I disagree.
[27:13.410 --> 27:15.850]  Going once for two with Eric.
[27:16.130 --> 27:16.750]  Bring Her Back.
[27:18.130 --> 27:18.530]  Twice.
[27:20.210 --> 27:21.290]  Sold to Eric.
[27:21.490 --> 27:21.790]  Cool.
[27:22.050 --> 27:22.750]  Two points.
[27:23.230 --> 27:26.210]  I don't think it's going to do super, super well, but I think it's going to do pretty good.
[27:26.330 --> 27:31.070]  I think it's the, I think it's the guys who made, uh, was it Talk to Me or whatever?
[27:31.270 --> 27:31.710]  It is, yeah.
[27:32.030 --> 27:32.230]  Yeah.
[27:32.230 --> 27:36.030]  I could definitely seeing it being like one of those hereditary type successes where,
[27:36.490 --> 27:38.030]  where it's like a really popular.
[27:38.390 --> 27:39.350]  Yes, exactly.
[27:39.550 --> 27:43.930]  Yeah, we're like, it's, it's like the, the art house horror thing that like fits.
[27:44.350 --> 27:45.130]  You got that at a bargain.
[27:45.370 --> 27:45.890]  Yeah, definitely.
[27:47.290 --> 27:51.210]  Speaking of art house classics, Karate Kid Legends.
[27:51.610 --> 27:51.950]  One.
[27:52.490 --> 27:53.330]  What is this?
[27:53.490 --> 27:58.190]  After Kung Fu prodigy Lee Fong relocates to New York City, he attracts unwanted attention
[27:58.190 --> 28:02.060]  from a local karate champion and embarks on a journey to enter the ultimate karate competition
[28:02.970 --> 28:06.390]  with the help of Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso.
[28:06.410 --> 28:08.430]  It is the Avengers Karate Kid Styles.
[28:08.550 --> 28:11.150]  It's Jackie Chan and the original guy.
[28:11.270 --> 28:13.750]  They're bringing both versions together.
[28:14.170 --> 28:15.850]  Ralph Lachio is in a movie?
[28:16.270 --> 28:16.770]  He's back.
[28:17.570 --> 28:20.290]  Well, he's also been on the Karate Kid TV show on Netflix.
[28:20.590 --> 28:20.870]  Yeah, so what?
[28:21.310 --> 28:21.850]  Right.
[28:22.130 --> 28:23.070]  Five seasons or whatever.
[28:23.370 --> 28:24.890]  You said five seasons?
[28:24.970 --> 28:25.590]  I'll say five.
[28:25.590 --> 28:27.310]  I'll put five on Karate Kid Legends.
[28:27.750 --> 28:29.470]  I'll bid eight on the Karate Kid.
[28:29.970 --> 28:32.710]  I'll bid nine on the Karate Kid.
[28:33.610 --> 28:34.770]  Oh, too rich for my blood.
[28:35.250 --> 28:35.630]  Ten.
[28:36.650 --> 28:38.770]  I'll bid 13 on the Karate Kid.
[28:38.810 --> 28:39.250]  Ooh.
[28:39.890 --> 28:40.510]  Fifteen.
[28:43.070 --> 28:43.710]  Uh...
[28:44.210 --> 28:45.150]  Fifteen going once.
[28:47.110 --> 28:48.650]  Fifteen going twice.
[28:50.150 --> 28:51.310]  Sold to Geoff.
[28:51.910 --> 28:53.050]  Fifteen points.
[28:53.730 --> 28:54.010]  Dang.
[28:54.550 --> 28:55.870]  That could be a really good buy, Geoff.
[28:56.250 --> 28:57.030]  I like Jackie Chan.
[28:57.390 --> 28:59.290]  I really don't know how to judge that movie yet.
[28:59.550 --> 29:02.430]  Me neither. I have no idea. I can't believe. That's crazy.
[29:02.730 --> 29:05.610]  Yeah, I saw the trailer for it this weekend and I was blown away that it existed.
[29:06.110 --> 29:11.650]  Next film up is The Phoenician Scheme, a story of a family and a family business.
[29:13.850 --> 29:14.210]  Six.
[29:14.890 --> 29:15.290]  Ten.
[29:15.990 --> 29:17.270]  Well, what do people know about this movie?
[29:17.790 --> 29:19.150]  It's a Wes Anderson film.
[29:19.450 --> 29:19.850]  Oh.
[29:19.850 --> 29:20.230]  Oh.
[29:22.570 --> 29:25.290]  Which means everybody's going to love it and nobody's going to see it in a theater.
[29:25.810 --> 29:25.950]  Yep.
[29:26.590 --> 29:27.970]  Who has ten, Suri?
[29:28.330 --> 29:28.510]  Me.
[29:29.050 --> 29:30.350]  Eric with ten going once.
[29:30.710 --> 29:33.310]  Going to be an awesome movie, though.
[29:33.910 --> 29:36.070]  Sold to Eric for ten points.
[29:36.550 --> 29:37.270]  Once it's on streaming.
[29:37.770 --> 29:37.910]  Yeah.
[29:38.650 --> 29:41.990]  It's not going to do... I don't think it's going to do huge, huge, but I think it'll be...
[29:41.990 --> 29:44.010]  That'll be a nice little bump for me.
[29:44.090 --> 29:46.870]  I have, like, a lot of small stuff. I got, like, a lot of small stuff, so...
[29:46.870 --> 29:48.210]  Who's the main character in that one?
[29:48.210 --> 29:49.910]  Benicio Del Toro, I think.
[29:50.270 --> 29:50.730]  Okay, cool.
[29:51.050 --> 29:51.370]  Awesome.
[29:51.950 --> 29:57.110]  Next film up is Ballerina, an assassin trained in the traditions of the Ruska Roma organization,
[29:57.270 --> 30:00.430]  sets out to seek revenge after her father's death.
[30:00.730 --> 30:01.330]  I'll do five.
[30:01.810 --> 30:02.530]  I'll put eight.
[30:02.550 --> 30:02.690]  Ten.
[30:02.770 --> 30:02.970]  Six.
[30:03.270 --> 30:03.550]  Ten.
[30:03.650 --> 30:03.750]  Oh.
[30:04.210 --> 30:04.450]  Ooh.
[30:05.690 --> 30:06.170]  Eleven.
[30:06.530 --> 30:06.990]  Fifteen.
[30:07.930 --> 30:08.410]  Fifteen.
[30:10.310 --> 30:10.790]  Sixteen.
[30:11.350 --> 30:11.630]  Ooh.
[30:12.110 --> 30:12.590]  Ooh.
[30:13.770 --> 30:17.390]  Gavin, you don't know what this is, probably, but this is a John Wick spinoff.
[30:17.390 --> 30:18.310]  Going once.
[30:19.010 --> 30:20.010]  What, Dangerous Animals?
[30:20.870 --> 30:21.830]  No, Ballerina.
[30:22.950 --> 30:24.990]  He doesn't even know what movie's up for bid.
[30:24.990 --> 30:25.270]  Open.
[30:25.790 --> 30:28.630]  Going twice.
[30:29.230 --> 30:29.790]  Seventeen.
[30:30.310 --> 30:31.790]  Eric with seventeen, going once.
[30:32.790 --> 30:33.890]  Going twice.
[30:35.050 --> 30:37.330]  Sold to Eric for seventeen points.
[30:37.630 --> 30:38.010]  Good job.
[30:38.690 --> 30:41.710]  I don't love where I'm at numbers-wise right now.
[30:41.950 --> 30:42.590]  I'm liking it.
[30:43.010 --> 30:43.850]  That's pretty... thanks, man.
[30:43.850 --> 30:48.390]  But, uh, I feel like that one's probably going to do pretty good.
[30:49.010 --> 30:49.890]  Yeah, for sure.
[30:50.010 --> 30:51.210]  I think so. It was a good pickup.
[30:51.610 --> 30:53.430]  Next film is Dangerous Animals.
[30:54.110 --> 31:05.790]  When a Zephyr, a savvy and free-spirited surfer, is abducted by a shark-obsessed serial killer and held captive on his boat, she must figure out how to escape before he carries out a ritualistic feeding to the sharks below.
[31:06.010 --> 31:06.490]  One!
[31:06.710 --> 31:07.130]  What?
[31:07.530 --> 31:10.370]  I was hoping this would be a sequel to Fierce Creatures, but it's...
[31:10.370 --> 31:10.770]  Yeah!
[31:12.090 --> 31:13.890]  What the fuck?
[31:14.130 --> 31:15.790]  Nick with one on Dangerous Animals.
[31:17.070 --> 31:18.030]  Going once.
[31:18.970 --> 31:19.430]  I'll go two.
[31:19.970 --> 31:20.790]  Geoff with two.
[31:21.890 --> 31:22.790]  Oh, never mind. I'm out.
[31:23.450 --> 31:24.550]  Nick is out.
[31:24.550 --> 31:24.750]  I'm out!
[31:27.270 --> 31:31.110]  The Jai Courtney vehicle going with two points for Geoff.
[31:31.710 --> 31:32.110]  Oh my god.
[31:32.210 --> 31:32.550]  Going once.
[31:34.270 --> 31:34.590]  Twice.
[31:36.290 --> 31:38.250]  Sold to Geoff for two points.
[31:38.450 --> 31:40.490]  Are we still doing Jai Courtney vehicles?
[31:41.330 --> 31:41.890]  Apparently.
[31:42.490 --> 31:43.490]  This is going to be his big comeback.
[31:43.830 --> 31:44.710]  That's crazy.
[31:45.230 --> 31:46.490]  That wasn't a John Wick movie, right?
[31:47.070 --> 31:47.970]  No, that one's not.
[31:47.990 --> 31:48.990]  That was a shark movie.
[31:50.410 --> 32:00.250]  The ritual, two priests, one in crisis with his faith and the other confronting a turbulent past, must overcome their differences to perform a risky exorcism.
[32:00.870 --> 32:01.090]  Two!
[32:01.650 --> 32:02.130]  Five.
[32:02.690 --> 32:03.770]  Geoff with five.
[32:04.590 --> 32:06.430]  Geoff with five going once.
[32:07.770 --> 32:09.530]  Geoff with five going twice.
[32:10.570 --> 32:12.090]  Sold to Geoff.
[32:12.730 --> 32:14.010]  That's Robert De Niro.
[32:14.650 --> 32:15.010]  Yeah.
[32:15.890 --> 32:17.870]  A lot of horror this summer.
[32:19.410 --> 32:23.030]  Next film is I Don't Understand You.
[32:23.590 --> 32:34.630]  Stranded in rural Italy without transportation or language skills, an American couple on the verge of adopting tries to reconnect during a disastrous vacation as their fears and relationship problems threaten to boil over.
[32:35.510 --> 32:36.270]  Gavin with one.
[32:37.410 --> 32:39.030]  Gavin with one going once.
[32:40.950 --> 32:42.010]  I've not heard of this.
[32:42.090 --> 32:43.110]  I don't know anything about this movie.
[32:44.010 --> 32:44.870]  Nick Kroll's in it.
[32:45.810 --> 32:47.090]  Sold to Gavin.
[32:47.910 --> 32:51.830]  I wonder if that's going to be a better bang for my buck than Lilo and Stitch.
[32:52.390 --> 32:53.590]  You know, we're going to see.
[32:54.750 --> 32:57.590]  It's got Nick Kroll in it, so at one, you might have overpaid.
[33:01.790 --> 33:06.090]  No, he's fine. I'm kidding.
[33:06.390 --> 33:07.990]  I'm kidding. That's comedy.
[33:07.990 --> 33:09.830]  I like Kroll's show. Great show.
[33:10.030 --> 33:14.950]  Next film, live action How to Train Your Dragon as an ancient dragon.
[33:16.270 --> 33:16.370]  Eleven.
[33:16.890 --> 33:18.570]  Fucking dragons and kids.
[33:18.810 --> 33:19.610]  Fifteen.
[33:20.110 --> 33:20.730]  Sixteen.
[33:21.190 --> 33:21.610]  Seventeen.
[33:22.550 --> 33:22.950]  Eighteen.
[33:26.430 --> 33:27.310]  Twenty-five.
[33:27.690 --> 33:28.330]  Wow.
[33:28.650 --> 33:29.490]  Oh, shit.
[33:29.910 --> 33:30.290]  Twenty-six.
[33:30.870 --> 33:31.930]  Fuck you.
[33:35.510 --> 33:35.910]  Wow.
[33:35.930 --> 33:36.890]  Twenty-six.
[33:37.650 --> 33:38.170]  Damn.
[33:38.970 --> 33:39.730]  Going once.
[33:40.270 --> 33:40.690]  Twenty-seven.
[33:40.950 --> 33:41.170]  Thirty.
[33:41.810 --> 33:43.590]  I bet that does better than the Disney one, honestly.
[33:43.870 --> 33:45.070]  It will. Thirty-one.
[33:45.850 --> 33:46.470]  Nick with thirty-one.
[33:47.630 --> 33:48.670]  Thirty-five.
[33:49.550 --> 33:49.990]  Thirty-six.
[33:50.930 --> 33:51.450]  Wow.
[33:52.130 --> 33:56.170]  Epic Universe is about to launch with a whole How to Train Your Dragon section in the park.
[33:56.430 --> 33:57.750]  That's true. Nick with thirty-six.
[33:58.170 --> 33:58.790]  Going once.
[33:59.370 --> 33:59.910]  Thirty-seven.
[34:01.090 --> 34:01.610]  Gavin.
[34:01.930 --> 34:02.290]  Thirty-eight.
[34:02.890 --> 34:05.310]  Coming up. Nick countering immediately.
[34:06.070 --> 34:06.590]  Forty.
[34:07.650 --> 34:08.810]  Eric with forty.
[34:09.750 --> 34:10.870]  Going once.
[34:12.750 --> 34:14.090]  Going twice.
[34:14.730 --> 34:15.210]  Forty-one.
[34:15.870 --> 34:16.250]  Wow.
[34:17.360 --> 34:18.970]  Forty-one to Nick.
[34:19.850 --> 34:20.370]  Going once.
[34:20.370 --> 34:21.910]  Oh, God, it's last year all over again.
[34:22.770 --> 34:23.610]  Going twice.
[34:24.110 --> 34:24.830]  Forty-two.
[34:25.590 --> 34:27.530]  Gavin with forty-two.
[34:27.810 --> 34:28.910]  Going once.
[34:30.290 --> 34:31.630]  Going twice.
[34:32.130 --> 34:32.690]  Forty-three.
[34:33.210 --> 34:34.430]  Jesus Christ.
[34:34.550 --> 34:36.230]  It is just rallying back and forth.
[34:36.230 --> 34:37.390]  Nick with forty-three.
[34:37.650 --> 34:38.930]  Going once.
[34:40.250 --> 34:41.690]  Going twice.
[34:42.030 --> 34:42.690]  Forty-four.
[34:46.630 --> 34:47.710]  Forty-five.
[34:48.270 --> 34:50.030]  Forty-five to Nick.
[34:50.150 --> 34:50.570]  Wow.
[34:51.130 --> 34:53.070]  Nick with forty-five.
[34:53.210 --> 34:54.270]  Going once.
[34:54.370 --> 34:54.770]  Forty-six.
[34:55.510 --> 34:56.690]  Forty-six.
[34:57.090 --> 34:59.570]  This one movie is going to wipe out someone's wealth.
[34:59.890 --> 35:00.030]  Yeah.
[35:00.790 --> 35:03.030]  But it might really rocket them.
[35:03.370 --> 35:05.250]  Because this is going to...
[35:05.250 --> 35:06.370]  Geoff, you're so fucking right.
[35:06.410 --> 35:07.150]  It's going to be so big.
[35:07.450 --> 35:08.310]  Forty-seven.
[35:08.550 --> 35:10.150]  Nick with forty-seven.
[35:10.170 --> 35:11.190]  Going once.
[35:11.550 --> 35:14.010]  Wait, was that Andrew bidding forty-six or was someone else forty-six?
[35:14.390 --> 35:15.350]  Nick, you were.
[35:15.770 --> 35:16.130]  Weren't you?
[35:16.430 --> 35:16.850]  What?
[35:17.650 --> 35:18.710]  Who said what?
[35:18.790 --> 35:19.170]  Who's the...
[35:19.170 --> 35:19.690]  I didn't bid.
[35:19.970 --> 35:20.830]  I just sometimes...
[35:20.830 --> 35:21.110]  Okay.
[35:22.110 --> 35:23.350]  I can't tell if you're repeating...
[35:23.350 --> 35:23.690]  Forty-eight.
[35:24.870 --> 35:25.930]  All that for that?
[35:26.710 --> 35:28.110]  Gavin with forty-eight.
[35:29.050 --> 35:29.870]  Going once.
[35:30.130 --> 35:30.870]  Whoa, he did it!
[35:31.130 --> 35:31.930]  He did it.
[35:32.510 --> 35:33.770]  Fifty, going once.
[35:34.130 --> 35:35.930]  He just played me like a fiddle, didn't he?
[35:36.390 --> 35:37.290]  Going twice.
[35:40.090 --> 35:42.690]  Sold to Nick for fifty points.
[35:43.750 --> 35:44.210]  Nick's out.
[35:44.310 --> 35:45.190]  That's the last of Nick.
[35:45.910 --> 35:46.470]  That's it.
[35:46.950 --> 35:47.450]  It's a good get.
[35:47.610 --> 35:47.910]  Goddamn.
[35:48.290 --> 35:49.030]  It's a great get.
[35:49.210 --> 35:50.690]  I think...
[35:50.690 --> 35:52.410]  Man, is it going to be...
[35:52.410 --> 35:57.670]  You have Mission Impossible Final Fractioning and you have How to Train Your Dragon.
[35:57.930 --> 35:58.950]  Those are huge.
[35:59.150 --> 36:01.150]  And Thunderbolts if it's a huge hit.
[36:01.150 --> 36:03.390]  If it's like a return to form for Marvel, you know?
[36:03.770 --> 36:06.490]  It could be a definite threat in this.
[36:06.670 --> 36:08.070]  It could be a billion dollars right there.
[36:08.350 --> 36:09.130]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[36:09.610 --> 36:11.690]  Next film up is Materialist.
[36:12.370 --> 36:18.350]  A matchmaker's lucrative business is complicated when she falls into a toxic love triangle that threatens her clients.
[36:19.070 --> 36:20.110]  I'll go two.
[36:20.930 --> 36:21.890]  I'll go three.
[36:22.430 --> 36:23.530]  Oh, the cast is really good.
[36:23.770 --> 36:24.270]  Four.
[36:24.890 --> 36:25.410]  Five.
[36:26.090 --> 36:26.990]  Five going once.
[36:27.590 --> 36:29.150]  Someone bid up Andrew's points away.
[36:29.150 --> 36:30.370]  I'm going six.
[36:30.850 --> 36:31.950]  Geoff with six.
[36:33.010 --> 36:34.450]  Six going once.
[36:35.270 --> 36:37.030]  What does Andrew know that we don't?
[36:37.110 --> 36:38.550]  The rest of the list.
[36:38.830 --> 36:40.810]  He's looking at Superman.
[36:41.070 --> 36:42.490]  He's looking at Jurassic World.
[36:42.850 --> 36:45.150]  He's looking at the whole fucking back half.
[36:45.450 --> 36:46.570]  What are you talking about?
[36:47.210 --> 36:48.130]  Superman, who cares?
[36:48.390 --> 36:54.930]  I think that's going to do what that fucking It Starts With Us movie did for me last time.
[36:55.590 --> 36:56.530]  Or It Ends With Us.
[36:56.730 --> 36:57.750]  Or We Are The Thing.
[36:57.750 --> 36:59.110]  I don't know who the fuck it was.
[37:00.510 --> 37:15.930]  Next up is Elio, a space fanatic with an active imagination, finds himself on a cosmic misadventure where he must form new bombs with alien life forms, navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions, and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be.
[37:16.490 --> 37:17.110]  I'll go two.
[37:17.710 --> 37:18.270]  Three.
[37:19.190 --> 37:19.750]  Four.
[37:24.320 --> 37:26.060]  Four going once.
[37:26.100 --> 37:26.820]  I guess five.
[37:26.960 --> 37:27.420]  I'll do five.
[37:29.620 --> 37:31.380]  It's about where it stands, huh?
[37:31.920 --> 37:32.400]  Yeah.
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.400]  This just does not look like anything.
[37:35.120 --> 37:35.420]  Six.
[37:35.720 --> 37:36.320]  Okay.
[37:38.320 --> 37:39.880]  Six going once.
[37:40.180 --> 37:40.800]  Oh god.
[37:41.620 --> 37:45.700]  It's just right on the back of How To Train Your Dragon.
[37:46.360 --> 37:52.660]  There's just no way anyone's going to choose whatever the fuck Elio is over How To Train Your Dragon, right?
[37:53.520 --> 37:54.840]  Six going twice.
[37:55.320 --> 37:55.680]  Seven.
[37:56.160 --> 37:56.500]  Oh!
[37:58.160 --> 37:59.700]  Geoff from the shadows.
[38:00.040 --> 38:00.820]  Out of nowhere.
[38:01.760 --> 38:02.580]  I'll go eight.
[38:05.140 --> 38:06.480]  Eight going once.
[38:07.700 --> 38:08.720]  Going twice.
[38:09.740 --> 38:10.280]  Nine.
[38:11.100 --> 38:11.620]  Oh!
[38:14.100 --> 38:15.920]  Is it worth the double digits for you, Andrew?
[38:16.220 --> 38:16.580]  Yeah.
[38:16.860 --> 38:18.520]  Nine going ten.
[38:19.280 --> 38:21.140]  Fuck it, I'll go ten.
[38:21.480 --> 38:21.840]  I'm out.
[38:22.980 --> 38:23.780]  Going once.
[38:25.220 --> 38:26.340]  Going twice.
[38:27.600 --> 38:29.220]  Sold to me for ten.
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.700]  Pixar isn't the guarantee it used to be, but it's still a Pixar film.
[38:34.060 --> 38:36.300]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:36.580 --> 38:38.180]  That could be a bargain in the end.
[38:38.880 --> 38:40.540]  I'm so excited for this movie.
[38:41.740 --> 38:42.900]  Next film up.
[38:43.640 --> 38:44.080]  Yeah, dude.
[38:45.520 --> 38:47.620]  28 years later.
[38:48.200 --> 38:48.380]  One.
[38:49.500 --> 38:50.680]  I'll go two.
[38:53.200 --> 38:53.760]  Three.
[38:53.780 --> 38:56.240]  A group of survivors of the raid fires live on a small island.
[38:56.420 --> 38:59.220]  When one of the group leaves the island on a mission, you get it.
[38:59.560 --> 38:59.860]  Zombies.
[39:00.460 --> 39:01.020]  Five.
[39:01.200 --> 39:01.540]  Six.
[39:02.500 --> 39:03.060]  Seven.
[39:03.440 --> 39:03.580]  Eight.
[39:03.580 --> 39:03.860]  Ten.
[39:04.400 --> 39:08.160]  Ten going once to Eric.
[39:09.120 --> 39:10.760]  Ten going twice.
[39:11.020 --> 39:11.280]  Twelve.
[39:13.080 --> 39:14.680]  Is Danny Boyle directing this?
[39:15.060 --> 39:15.540]  He is.
[39:16.060 --> 39:16.240]  Yeah.
[39:16.880 --> 39:17.440]  Thirteen.
[39:18.420 --> 39:19.340]  Gavin with thirteen.
[39:20.380 --> 39:21.280]  Going once.
[39:22.320 --> 39:23.380]  Going twice.
[39:24.480 --> 39:27.220]  Sold to Gavin for thirteen points.
[39:27.500 --> 39:29.380]  Shouldn't have outbid myself there.
[39:30.000 --> 39:30.420]  Uh, yeah.
[39:31.360 --> 39:33.560]  Very interesting, but good plan.
[39:33.660 --> 39:34.280]  I like it.
[39:35.300 --> 39:36.560]  Keep him guessing, Gavin.
[39:36.660 --> 39:37.140]  Keep him guessing.
[39:37.460 --> 39:37.600]  Yep.
[39:39.240 --> 39:41.220]  Next one on the list.
[39:41.620 --> 39:42.300]  F1.
[39:42.640 --> 39:43.580]  Starring Brad Pitt.
[39:44.560 --> 39:45.660]  I'll go two.
[39:46.520 --> 39:46.980]  Three.
[39:48.300 --> 39:48.640]  Four.
[39:49.720 --> 39:51.380]  Four going once.
[39:51.680 --> 39:52.340]  Six.
[39:53.100 --> 39:53.580]  Seven.
[39:54.500 --> 39:56.220]  Whoa, Geoff out of nowhere.
[39:56.760 --> 39:57.140]  Seven.
[39:57.800 --> 40:00.100]  I'll go eight because Geoff likes it and he did research.
[40:01.040 --> 40:01.800]  Nine.
[40:02.700 --> 40:03.220]  Ten?
[40:04.260 --> 40:06.220]  I love bids with question marks.
[40:06.560 --> 40:06.940]  Ten?
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.480]  Ten to Andrew.
[40:09.220 --> 40:10.700]  I'll go eleven.
[40:11.500 --> 40:11.860]  Ooh.
[40:14.200 --> 40:14.960]  Twelve.
[40:15.820 --> 40:16.580]  Wow.
[40:17.120 --> 40:18.740]  Ooh, this is good.
[40:19.000 --> 40:19.460]  Interesting.
[40:19.920 --> 40:20.300]  Thirteen.
[40:21.660 --> 40:22.920]  Thirteen going once.
[40:25.360 --> 40:26.820]  Thirteen going twice.
[40:28.160 --> 40:31.500]  Sold to Geoff for thirteen points.
[40:31.960 --> 40:32.320]  There it is.
[40:33.380 --> 40:34.240]  Hell yeah, Geoff.
[40:34.780 --> 40:36.320]  I think that might be right about what it's worth.
[40:36.400 --> 40:36.680]  We'll see.
[40:37.540 --> 40:40.080]  Yeah, I think you'll scrape some money for that.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.740]  Domestic is gonna be tough.
[40:41.900 --> 40:43.620]  Like international, I think it'll probably do great.
[40:44.260 --> 40:46.080]  Yeah, but here, I don't know.
[40:46.620 --> 40:46.780]  Yeah.
[40:47.540 --> 40:49.820]  Brad Pitt's a bit of a damaged brand these days, too.
[40:49.820 --> 40:51.220]  He is.
[40:51.500 --> 40:53.420]  Megan 2.0 is the next film up.
[40:54.040 --> 40:54.580]  Mithregan 2.
[40:55.560 --> 40:56.600]  Mithregan 2.
[40:57.560 --> 40:59.760]  I'm gonna bid three for Mithregan 2.
[41:00.120 --> 41:01.160]  I'll bid five.
[41:01.700 --> 41:02.900]  For Mithregan 2?
[41:03.340 --> 41:04.820]  I'll bid seven.
[41:05.580 --> 41:07.240]  Seven for Mithregan 2.
[41:07.400 --> 41:08.500]  Holy shit.
[41:09.840 --> 41:10.100]  Eight.
[41:10.760 --> 41:11.320]  Wow.
[41:12.920 --> 41:14.620]  Now, do you want me to counterbid, Gavin?
[41:14.680 --> 41:16.480]  Or do you want me to wait for you to counterbid yourself?
[41:17.060 --> 41:17.980]  That's up to you.
[41:17.980 --> 41:18.080]  Okay.
[41:18.540 --> 41:18.900]  Nine.
[41:22.380 --> 41:25.120]  You guys have got to bid Andrew's points away.
[41:26.040 --> 41:26.960]  Going once.
[41:28.580 --> 41:29.100]  Twice.
[41:29.920 --> 41:30.320]  Shit.
[41:30.900 --> 41:33.060]  Sold to me for nine points.
[41:33.260 --> 41:34.200]  I think that's a great get.
[41:34.560 --> 41:35.720]  Yeah, I think that's a pretty good get.
[41:36.080 --> 41:38.200]  Mithregan 1 was pretty good and pretty popular.
[41:38.620 --> 41:40.960]  Yeah, but are people clamoring for Mithregan 2?
[41:41.480 --> 41:44.600]  I think the marketing was strong and people remember it fondly.
[41:45.020 --> 41:46.060]  Yeah, I'm excited about it.
[41:46.060 --> 41:48.160]  I think Mithregan 3 is going to kill.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.120]  We simply call that Mithregan, but we'll have to wait until next year.
[41:54.760 --> 41:58.220]  Next up is Jurassic World Rebirth.
[41:58.760 --> 42:01.080]  No need to go over that plot, we already did it.
[42:01.580 --> 42:04.020]  I'm going to set the bidding hide with four.
[42:04.640 --> 42:05.160]  Five.
[42:05.860 --> 42:06.420]  Six.
[42:07.200 --> 42:07.620]  Seven.
[42:08.160 --> 42:08.520]  Forty-two.
[42:09.340 --> 42:09.620]  Whoa!
[42:10.360 --> 42:10.720]  What?
[42:10.920 --> 42:11.920]  What did you say, Gav?
[42:12.140 --> 42:12.920]  I said forty-two.
[42:13.480 --> 42:14.980]  Are you...
[42:15.580 --> 42:15.900]  Okay.
[42:16.080 --> 42:17.080]  I'm with forty-two.
[42:17.840 --> 42:19.000]  Going once.
[42:19.860 --> 42:20.160]  Whoa!
[42:21.040 --> 42:22.120]  Going twice.
[42:22.420 --> 42:22.960]  Wow!
[42:23.560 --> 42:26.260]  I don't have enough points to contend with the big hits.
[42:26.880 --> 42:27.240]  I hear you.
[42:27.280 --> 42:30.880]  Sold to Gavin with forty-two points.
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.360]  Interesting that Gavin had two forty-two point movies.
[42:34.660 --> 42:34.920]  Yeah!
[42:37.160 --> 42:37.800]  Wow!
[42:38.460 --> 42:40.240]  I did get there, Gav.
[42:40.500 --> 42:43.000]  Maybe a little high, but maybe a little behind.
[42:43.560 --> 42:46.000]  Next up on the list is Superman.
[42:46.380 --> 42:47.240]  James Gunn's Superman.
[42:48.240 --> 42:48.680]  Sixty-three.
[42:49.580 --> 42:50.820]  I love someone just pulling.
[42:51.680 --> 42:52.660]  Alright, there you go, that's it.
[42:52.660 --> 42:53.320]  That's it for Eric.
[42:55.040 --> 42:55.800]  Sixty-three.
[42:56.260 --> 42:57.140]  Got the movie he wanted.
[42:57.620 --> 42:59.880]  Thank you for working Andrew down just enough.
[43:00.280 --> 43:02.660]  Are you confident because it's James Gunn at the helm?
[43:02.840 --> 43:07.940]  I think that this is the turnaround DC thing that people go...
[43:08.460 --> 43:11.300]  I think it's going to have a big opening weekend and then people are going to go,
[43:11.300 --> 43:14.360]  Hey, that Superman movie was actually pretty good, you should go see it.
[43:14.440 --> 43:17.700]  And then it's going to do better for a few weeks.
[43:18.200 --> 43:19.920]  I just think it's going to be really strong.
[43:20.300 --> 43:20.860]  I think you could be right.
[43:21.320 --> 43:22.440]  Yeah, you could be.
[43:22.640 --> 43:25.020]  Next up on the list, Smurfs.
[43:25.220 --> 43:27.660]  I also have shit for the rest of my stuff.
[43:28.040 --> 43:30.980]  So I kind of have to get one heavy hitter late to see what happens.
[43:31.220 --> 43:33.080]  So it's just between you and I now, Andrew.
[43:35.020 --> 43:36.600]  Right here, this is the boys.
[43:37.640 --> 43:39.820]  The rest of these movies, this is for the boys.
[43:40.220 --> 43:41.280]  I'll do one on Smurfs.
[43:42.500 --> 43:43.360]  I'll do two.
[43:43.640 --> 43:45.140]  I'll do three.
[43:45.580 --> 43:49.680]  It's weird to look back at the board and just see my load all over it.
[43:49.700 --> 43:50.600]  Where are you at, Andrew?
[43:50.940 --> 43:52.240]  I'm at three, Geoff.
[43:52.540 --> 43:53.060]  Four?
[43:54.360 --> 43:56.480]  Man, I blew this so hard.
[43:56.480 --> 43:57.700]  I'll give you Smurfs for four.
[43:58.300 --> 44:01.040]  Oh, Geoff with four Smurfs.
[44:01.180 --> 44:03.320]  Geoff, name four Smurfs.
[44:04.080 --> 44:09.340]  Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Lazy Smurf, and Sleepy Smurf.
[44:10.080 --> 44:12.900]  I think those last two might be the same Smurf, buddy.
[44:13.120 --> 44:14.120]  Oh, I don't think so.
[44:14.300 --> 44:17.260]  It looks fucking awful.
[44:19.060 --> 44:22.180]  Next one up, I Know What You Did Last Summer.
[44:22.480 --> 44:23.240]  Brainy Smurf.
[44:23.820 --> 44:24.380]  There you go.
[44:24.580 --> 44:27.420]  I'll put one point on I Know What You Did Last Summer.
[44:27.900 --> 44:29.180]  I'll go two.
[44:30.780 --> 44:32.080]  I'll go three.
[44:32.720 --> 44:34.100]  I'll go four.
[44:36.980 --> 44:38.420]  I'll give it to you for four.
[44:38.420 --> 44:39.140]  Thank you.
[44:39.440 --> 44:41.900]  Wow, Geoff, I think that's going to do pretty good.
[44:42.220 --> 44:43.000]  I hope so.
[44:43.360 --> 44:45.440]  I think Andrew's saving up for a specific one, maybe.
[44:45.880 --> 44:46.960]  Oh, yeah, the next one?
[44:47.320 --> 44:47.620]  Yeah.
[44:49.700 --> 44:52.400]  Next up is the Fantastic Four.
[44:53.280 --> 44:54.060]  I'll go ten.
[44:54.640 --> 44:55.880]  How many points do I have? I can't tell.
[44:56.320 --> 44:56.860]  You have 41.
[44:57.620 --> 44:57.980]  Okay.
[44:59.980 --> 45:01.060]  What are you going, ten?
[45:01.380 --> 45:01.940]  I'm going ten.
[45:02.520 --> 45:04.500]  I'll go 14.
[45:05.340 --> 45:05.740]  15.
[45:06.400 --> 45:06.960]  16.
[45:07.540 --> 45:08.100]  17.
[45:09.400 --> 45:09.960]  18.
[45:10.860 --> 45:11.420]  19.
[45:12.620 --> 45:14.200]  All right, I'll go 20.
[45:14.680 --> 45:15.080]  21.
[45:15.440 --> 45:16.220]  You can have it.
[45:17.460 --> 45:17.820]  Wow.
[45:19.420 --> 45:20.440]  That's nuts.
[45:21.240 --> 45:22.740]  I would have bid him up.
[45:22.940 --> 45:23.400]  Great get.
[45:23.940 --> 45:24.760]  42, 41.
[45:24.900 --> 45:26.160]  Wow, you and I have essentially the same points.
[45:26.280 --> 45:26.420]  Yep.
[45:26.900 --> 45:29.020]  The next one is the Bad Guys 2.
[45:29.020 --> 45:30.340]  Ooh, kids movie.
[45:31.020 --> 45:32.120]  I'll go five points.
[45:35.560 --> 45:36.460]  There you go.
[45:40.080 --> 45:40.600]  Six.
[45:44.480 --> 45:45.000]  Seven.
[45:46.240 --> 45:47.340]  You can have it.
[45:48.760 --> 45:49.240]  Wow.
[45:50.560 --> 45:51.880]  I don't think the first one did very well.
[45:52.940 --> 45:53.620]  Seven points.
[45:54.340 --> 45:55.360]  Enough for a sequel, I guess.
[45:55.800 --> 45:57.560]  Geoff, you have 41, Andrew has 35.
[45:57.880 --> 45:58.860]  Okay, 41, 35.
[45:59.560 --> 46:01.440]  Beneath the Storm has been canceled, boys.
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.240]  But...
[46:02.240 --> 46:02.960]  It sure has.
[46:03.340 --> 46:04.700]  The Naked Gun is next.
[46:04.920 --> 46:07.960]  The Naked Gun, the reboot with Liam Neeson.
[46:08.640 --> 46:09.680]  I'll go three points.
[46:10.360 --> 46:11.220]  I'll go four points.
[46:12.020 --> 46:12.700]  Five points.
[46:13.440 --> 46:15.940]  This is probably the movie I'm most excited about on this whole list.
[46:16.180 --> 46:16.720]  Six points.
[46:16.740 --> 46:17.020]  Really?
[46:18.020 --> 46:19.020]  Seven points.
[46:19.900 --> 46:20.320]  Me too.
[46:20.420 --> 46:21.740]  I thought the trailer looked fun.
[46:21.920 --> 46:22.560]  I'm excited.
[46:22.560 --> 46:24.550]  You're going seven points?
[46:25.640 --> 46:26.460]  Seven points.
[46:26.760 --> 46:27.540]  I'll go eight.
[46:28.080 --> 46:28.700]  Nine.
[46:29.220 --> 46:30.720]  Alright, I'll go ten, fuck it.
[46:31.320 --> 46:31.680]  Eleven.
[46:33.020 --> 46:35.200]  Then you're gonna see me say twelve.
[46:35.780 --> 46:36.340]  Thirteen.
[46:36.680 --> 46:38.060]  Then you'll see me say fourteen.
[46:38.560 --> 46:39.160]  Fifteen.
[46:40.980 --> 46:41.600]  Sixteen.
[46:43.780 --> 46:44.400]  Seventeen.
[46:45.260 --> 46:46.780]  So this is the last big thing?
[46:46.800 --> 46:47.640]  Easy, easy.
[46:47.780 --> 46:48.200]  Eighteen.
[46:48.960 --> 46:49.360]  Nineteen.
[46:49.500 --> 46:50.460]  What about Freakier Friday?
[46:51.380 --> 46:52.980]  I thought they already made that.
[46:53.460 --> 46:53.860]  Nineteen.
[46:54.040 --> 46:55.800]  Yeah, I could do twenty for Naked Gun, why not?
[46:56.600 --> 46:57.200]  Twenty-one.
[46:58.000 --> 46:58.640]  You can have it.
[46:59.200 --> 47:01.100]  I'll take it for twenty-one points.
[47:01.780 --> 47:03.880]  I don't think it's worth twenty-one points.
[47:04.040 --> 47:04.540]  I don't either.
[47:06.260 --> 47:07.060]  That's where we're at.
[47:07.380 --> 47:08.860]  I figured I could bid you up for a little bit.
[47:09.280 --> 47:10.040]  Can we see the titles again?
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.360]  Yep, fourteen to forty-one.
[47:13.440 --> 47:14.880]  Geoff has forty-one.
[47:18.200 --> 47:18.900]  One.
[47:19.420 --> 47:19.920]  Two.
[47:21.680 --> 47:23.900]  I'll do three.
[47:24.780 --> 47:25.380]  Five.
[47:26.700 --> 47:27.680]  Six.
[47:28.660 --> 47:29.140]  Nine.
[47:31.640 --> 47:33.260]  I'll do ten.
[47:34.140 --> 47:34.620]  Eleven.
[47:38.720 --> 47:40.940]  Yeah, I can do twelve, why not?
[47:41.540 --> 47:42.520]  Thirteen.
[47:45.590 --> 47:46.980]  It's up to you if you want it now.
[47:47.840 --> 47:49.460]  You know what, you can have it.
[47:49.460 --> 47:52.760]  I get Freakier Friday with thirteen points.
[47:52.980 --> 47:53.660]  Thirteen points.
[47:54.140 --> 47:57.320]  That leaves Andrew with one and Geoff with forty-one.
[47:57.580 --> 48:00.140]  Alright, let's see how this plays out.
[48:00.440 --> 48:02.480]  You can just two everything and it's all yours, baby.
[48:02.900 --> 48:04.780]  Next film is one battle after another.
[48:04.920 --> 48:05.500]  One point.
[48:06.080 --> 48:06.240]  Two.
[48:06.680 --> 48:09.600]  Oh, shit, it goes to Geoff.
[48:09.880 --> 48:10.680]  Geoff got it.
[48:11.040 --> 48:11.580]  Two points.
[48:12.540 --> 48:15.260]  I think Geoff's just going to win on sheer numbers.
[48:16.100 --> 48:17.580]  I'm going to go one, Geoff.
[48:17.720 --> 48:18.060]  Two.
[48:18.700 --> 48:20.720]  Fuck! Geoff with two.
[48:20.940 --> 48:22.040]  He wins it.
[48:23.800 --> 48:25.960]  Geoff, we got nobody two on the list.
[48:26.040 --> 48:27.260]  I'm going to put one on that.
[48:27.660 --> 48:28.140]  Five.
[48:29.020 --> 48:31.680]  God damn it! Him with five.
[48:31.840 --> 48:34.200]  Brings you down to thirty-two there, Geoff, so be wise.
[48:35.220 --> 48:39.700]  Geoff's got so many movies, we can see them coming down the list from all the way down here.
[48:41.200 --> 48:41.680]  Americana.
[48:42.340 --> 48:43.180]  I'm going one.
[48:43.680 --> 48:44.940]  I'm going to go two.
[48:45.260 --> 48:45.560]  No!
[48:48.700 --> 48:50.460]  Geoff wins it with two.
[48:50.900 --> 48:52.100]  On the last film.
[48:52.920 --> 48:53.760]  God-stealing.
[48:54.240 --> 48:55.100]  I'm going one.
[48:55.500 --> 48:55.720]  Two.
[48:56.820 --> 48:58.840]  Isn't that one battle after another?
[48:59.060 --> 49:03.840]  That movie with Leonardo DiCaprio that everybody's talking about?
[49:04.560 --> 49:05.840]  Paul Thomas Anderson movie.
[49:06.140 --> 49:08.300]  Holy shit, that was some good stuff at the end.
[49:08.880 --> 49:10.320]  And Geoff, you've got twenty-eight bucks left.
[49:10.700 --> 49:11.180]  Yeah, you do.
[49:11.260 --> 49:12.400]  And Andrew has won.
[49:12.680 --> 49:14.800]  So we'll run it down.
[49:15.260 --> 49:19.880]  Andrew has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight movies here.
[49:20.560 --> 49:27.580]  One, two, three, four, five, six for Nick, seven for myself, four for Gavin.
[49:27.800 --> 49:36.480]  And Geoff has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen movies for Geoff.
[49:37.360 --> 49:38.320]  Oh boy.
[49:38.580 --> 49:39.520]  Holy cow.
[49:39.960 --> 49:44.100]  I came in with a plan and I got real caught up in the bidding and my plan went out the window.
[49:45.480 --> 49:49.020]  Now, caught up in the bidding, is that when you bid twelve and then you also bid thirteen?
[49:50.280 --> 49:56.220]  Yeah, and then what I bid, well, the thing is, I got stuck with extra points last time and I was really annoyed about it the whole year.
[49:57.780 --> 50:01.080]  I went, I maybe need to split the difference between those two approaches.
[50:03.620 --> 50:08.260]  Well, we did it. Geoff has thirty dollars left over and could that be the tiebreaker here?
[50:08.460 --> 50:10.540]  Very interested to see where everyone lands.
[50:11.120 --> 50:19.040]  We got some real steals in here. I have some stuff that maybe was overbid just a bit, but I think by and large we're probably right on the money with where stuff is going to land.
[50:19.320 --> 50:27.260]  Once again, I'm so excited to see how this unfolds. Is Thunderbolt going to be big? Some of these movies probably will get pushed, or at least one of them.
[50:27.600 --> 50:33.020]  Will we have another Horizon? Will Horizon get dated? That would be fucking crazy at this point.
[50:33.280 --> 50:33.880]  That'd be awesome.
[50:34.200 --> 50:35.820]  That would be insane.
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.980]  I feel like Nick's gotta be, Nick, you gotta be feeling pretty good right about now.
[50:40.540 --> 50:43.580]  Dude, I feel great. I got the ones I think are going to be blockbusters, so we'll see.
[50:43.900 --> 50:46.680]  Yeah, I think you're dead on with that How to Train Your Dragon, man.
[50:46.920 --> 50:54.900]  Yeah, they're definitely banking on it. I will say, if you want to play this game yourself, a person in our community does amazing stuff.
[50:55.220 --> 51:02.960]  Regulationfan.com, they have a whole template you can do so you can play with your friends this season. It's fantastic.
[51:03.420 --> 51:05.700]  And Nick, you got Mission Impossible for $29?
[51:06.080 --> 51:07.060]  Dude, that's a steal.
[51:07.260 --> 51:08.040]  That was a steal.
[51:08.040 --> 51:10.220]  Those movies make less than you would think.
[51:10.640 --> 51:22.500]  It's having it so early, I think, when you see that, and then down below it is How to Train Your Dragon, Lilo & Stitch, Superman, Jurassic World, you're like, well, where am I spending my money? Like, this is crazy.
[51:22.960 --> 51:24.560]  That's really hard. It's really, really hard.
[51:26.040 --> 51:32.300]  I'm really excited to see how this all turns out. I really liked it last week with the week-to-week sort of totals dating it.
[51:33.060 --> 51:36.260]  This is really exciting. This is great. I'm really, really pumped.
[51:36.260 --> 51:40.480]  I really hope people watch that turd Jurassic World movie.
[51:41.340 --> 51:43.820]  It's got Scarlett Johansson in it, right? It's going to be popular.
[51:44.580 --> 51:46.480]  I have a question for you guys.
[51:46.900 --> 51:51.880]  I don't think this has been covered. I don't know if we covered it last year. What does the winner get this year?
[51:52.280 --> 51:56.440]  I will reveal next time we record the podcast, I have a trophy.
[51:57.300 --> 51:57.740]  Wow!
[52:00.000 --> 52:01.300]  That's way better than my idea.
[52:01.300 --> 52:11.640]  That's so exciting. Well, remember, the dates of this are May 1st to September 22nd. That is it.
[52:11.920 --> 52:15.740]  That is the summer movie draft. Those are the dates, the beginning and the end.
[52:16.120 --> 52:20.600]  That's where money, domestic money, will be counted towards our totals.
[52:20.980 --> 52:24.600]  And I think that's it. Hey guys, how are you feeling? Anything else?
[52:25.040 --> 52:28.860]  I'm so excited to see just how it all plays out. I can't wait.
[52:29.020 --> 52:30.960]  Thank you guys so much for doing this again this year.
[52:31.300 --> 52:35.080]  I cannot wait to, as I said, see how this all unfolds.
[52:36.320 --> 52:38.620]  Ballerina be the number one film of the summer.
[52:40.180 --> 52:42.560]  Clown in a cornfield is going to go off.
[52:42.720 --> 52:45.520]  Yeah, it's about to be crazy Juliet and Romeo style, baby.
[52:46.120 --> 52:48.640]  Absolutely. Thank you so much for watching.
[52:48.720 --> 52:51.280]  Make sure to check out our Patreon at The Regulation Pod.
[52:51.780 --> 52:54.540]  We got YouTube channels, we do gameplays, regulation gameplay.

[52:57.440 --> 52:59.860]  And we'll see you at the movies.
[53:00.520 --> 53:02.420]  That was pretty cool. Bye.
[53:02.920 --> 53:06.120]  Bye Bobby. That's all good. Goodbye.
