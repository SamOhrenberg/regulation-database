[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Hello and welcome to a summer movie battle,
[00:02.960 --> 00:07.160]  which everybody understands the rules of and will not be any confusion of at all.
[00:07.260 --> 00:10.280]  This is sort of like a draft and or
[00:11.160 --> 00:12.940]  it's a draft, but it's an auction style.
[00:13.120 --> 00:16.300]  I don't know if you guys have ever done like an auction draft in a fantasy league,
[00:16.640 --> 00:18.000]  but it's very similar to that.
[00:19.140 --> 00:20.920]  Anyone, anyone do that before?
[00:21.440 --> 00:22.880]  No, you know, you know all about this.
[00:23.280 --> 00:25.340]  Yeah, Kevin, you're a big auction guy.
[00:25.580 --> 00:29.260]  Has anyone ever here outside of me been involved in an auction?
[00:29.260 --> 00:32.740]  I famously secured the tuxedo, I guess eBay.
[00:33.020 --> 00:34.220]  I didn't think about that.
[00:34.320 --> 00:38.420]  But yeah, a one billion Marcus Smart auctions on eBay.
[00:38.780 --> 00:41.160]  Well, there you go. You're going to be a veteran at this, Geoff.
[00:41.220 --> 00:45.340]  It is the same idea as an auction for how we're going to pick these.
[00:45.580 --> 00:46.720]  Is it a silent auction?
[00:47.180 --> 00:50.340]  No, it's a very audible auction because this is a podcast.
[00:50.840 --> 00:54.180]  Oh, yeah. Silent auction would not work.
[00:54.260 --> 00:58.180]  Well, as you see, we have our names listed on this document.
[00:58.180 --> 01:01.400]  We have an egg, Andrew, Nick, Eric, Geoff, Gavin.
[01:01.560 --> 01:06.580]  And above our names, we have 98 classic number last great year.
[01:06.700 --> 01:10.880]  Some would say how this is going to work as we all have 98 points
[01:10.880 --> 01:15.060]  and we're going to go through the movies on the left side of the screen.
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.880]  These are all coming out this summer and we're going to auction them off one by one.
[01:20.500 --> 01:23.860]  Your goal is to have the collection of movies
[01:23.860 --> 01:27.220]  that earns the most money domestically by the end of the summer.
[01:27.740 --> 01:28.820]  But we haven't seen them.
[01:29.280 --> 01:30.380]  No, we haven't seen them.
[01:30.460 --> 01:33.080]  But, you know, movies make money even if you don't see them, Gavin.
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.640]  I don't know if you know this, but some of you haven't seen the film.
[01:37.360 --> 01:39.920]  Doesn't actually equate to it making money.
[01:40.220 --> 01:42.700]  Good deal. So now it depends.
[01:42.820 --> 01:45.740]  Now, is are we in Gavin's universe right now or are we in yours?
[01:46.520 --> 01:48.760]  I'm hoping we're just in the universe.
[01:48.840 --> 01:52.000]  I don't know why we're specific to whose universe it is.
[01:52.180 --> 01:53.060]  Can I ask a question?
[01:53.600 --> 01:54.100]  Yeah, of course.
[01:54.100 --> 01:56.640]  How were the colors decided?
[01:57.380 --> 01:57.940]  Oh, interesting.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.100]  Good question.
[01:59.940 --> 02:00.560]  Very good question.
[02:00.640 --> 02:03.420]  Well, obviously, Geoff, you're kind of you're the orange guy.
[02:03.640 --> 02:04.580]  You have a history.
[02:05.100 --> 02:05.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.560]  Classically, classically, the orange guy.
[02:08.820 --> 02:09.420]  Yeah. Yeah.
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.020]  Eric is a piss rat, so he's got to be yellow.
[02:12.940 --> 02:15.800]  And I was happy to be yellow and now I'm not.
[02:15.940 --> 02:16.700]  So, all right.
[02:17.020 --> 02:18.220]  I like Grubbs' weed.
[02:19.340 --> 02:22.700]  Oh, yeah. Classic, classic ganja Nick.
[02:22.800 --> 02:23.620]  Oh, yeah, that's me.
[02:23.620 --> 02:25.440]  Not scared at all.
[02:25.440 --> 02:27.280]  Are Nick and Gavin happy with your colors?
[02:27.560 --> 02:28.160]  Love it.
[02:28.960 --> 02:30.540]  Are we going to auction off our colors?
[02:30.680 --> 02:32.200]  Should we have like a color like this?
[02:32.380 --> 02:35.300]  Should we have a one time color if anybody wants to swap colors?
[02:35.620 --> 02:35.960]  Make it right.
[02:36.140 --> 02:38.180]  I'll bid five points for blue.
[02:39.060 --> 02:39.780]  Oh, I'm good.
[02:40.640 --> 02:41.280]  I'm good.
[02:41.680 --> 02:42.640]  Anyone want yellow?
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.900]  You could start with one hundred and three points.
[02:46.180 --> 02:47.220]  Anyone want yellow?
[02:47.860 --> 02:48.220]  Anyone?
[02:48.940 --> 02:50.840]  You can't give away piss rat yellow.
[02:51.000 --> 02:51.760]  Yeah. You're a piss rat.
[02:51.760 --> 02:54.700]  I'll switch yellow for orange if you give me 40 points.
[02:54.800 --> 02:56.740]  Why the fuck would I give you anything?
[02:57.060 --> 02:58.720]  Yellow is a way better color than orange.
[02:58.820 --> 03:00.120]  I'm just seeing if there are any takers.
[03:00.640 --> 03:00.900]  All right.
[03:01.460 --> 03:03.000]  I'm willing to take yellow off your hands.
[03:03.060 --> 03:05.800]  You don't have to be the piss rat guy this one episode for 40 points.
[03:06.140 --> 03:08.540]  OK, hey, Andrew, I have a question about the rules.
[03:09.200 --> 03:09.400]  OK.
[03:10.020 --> 03:13.120]  You said money that these make domestically.
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.220]  I assume that means United States box office.
[03:16.380 --> 03:16.960]  Great question.
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.540]  I'm only asking because I've known you for this long
[03:20.540 --> 03:24.320]  and I don't anticipate this being an easy answer if I don't ask now.
[03:24.940 --> 03:29.360]  So when you look at box office modem, it's divided by worldwide or domestic.
[03:29.660 --> 03:30.540]  It's U.S. and Canada.
[03:31.200 --> 03:32.180]  Oh, OK. OK.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.780]  Yeah, that just felt like a really long answer that I was not going to get
[03:35.780 --> 03:36.980]  a straight answer for.
[03:37.440 --> 03:39.420]  But no, no, it was very straight. It was very clear.
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.740]  It was. Absolutely.
[03:41.180 --> 03:42.440]  No, no. You did a great job.
[03:42.560 --> 03:44.140]  I stand corrected. Thank you very much.
[03:44.200 --> 03:47.760]  This is a game that I played with my friends for quite a few years.
[03:47.800 --> 03:48.700]  So it's beta tested.
[03:48.700 --> 03:50.440]  I'm prepared for these questions.
[03:50.900 --> 03:52.600]  Six. Do we have any other questions?
[03:52.760 --> 03:55.900]  Gavin, you understand you're projecting you're trying to base
[03:55.900 --> 03:58.280]  even though the movie hasn't come out and you haven't seen it yet.
[03:58.420 --> 04:01.520]  You want to try to pick movies that you think will make money.
[04:01.960 --> 04:05.040]  And I bid six points for this intro.
[04:05.480 --> 04:09.420]  OK, so when so I do have a question, Andrew.
[04:09.600 --> 04:11.300]  OK, and it's a real one.
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.960]  It's not. Absolutely. I'm ready.
[04:13.660 --> 04:17.220]  So when is it over by the summer?
[04:17.220 --> 04:19.880]  Like, what's the last day of the competition?
[04:20.420 --> 04:21.980]  So when do we refilm?
[04:22.480 --> 04:25.740]  So I think the last movie on the list is Beetlejuice,
[04:25.780 --> 04:28.080]  which comes out in the first week of September.
[04:28.740 --> 04:31.600]  I did that to compensate for the fact that we're starting this a little bit late
[04:31.600 --> 04:32.860]  from when we typically start in May.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.880]  I say that we will wrap this up when Beetlejuice is no longer like making money.
[04:37.460 --> 04:40.420]  As long as whoever owns it can't be shifted.
[04:40.620 --> 04:41.880]  I don't I don't like that.
[04:42.020 --> 04:43.360]  I don't like that either. Like what?
[04:43.440 --> 04:45.220]  We need a date. There needs to be a date.
[04:45.220 --> 04:48.280]  Well, what I mean, maybe if it's like if it's over,
[04:48.360 --> 04:51.080]  when all films in their theatrical run or whatever.
[04:51.220 --> 04:55.240]  But what if Beetlejuice 2 is the next Titanic and it's in the theaters for a year?
[04:56.620 --> 04:58.320]  Then you probably win.
[04:58.460 --> 04:59.500]  Yeah, I just do.
[04:59.800 --> 05:04.040]  But I just I just think there needs to be like, OK, if the if the first
[05:04.040 --> 05:05.400]  how about October 1st?
[05:05.500 --> 05:08.480]  I was going to say, if the first day of fall is September 22nd
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.940]  and Beetlejuice comes out September 1st, let's give it a good month
[05:10.940 --> 05:14.480]  to get a gross and that would be October 1st.
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.120]  I think that's fair. We're starting a little bit.
[05:16.260 --> 05:18.680]  As long as we're all on the same page, that's fine.
[05:18.800 --> 05:22.180]  I just I kind of left it open ended because it's sort of at a disadvantage
[05:22.180 --> 05:23.340]  opening the latest.
[05:23.740 --> 05:26.100]  But if we all are going in knowing it's October 1st.
[05:26.200 --> 05:27.660]  But but that's part of the auction, baby.
[05:27.800 --> 05:29.860]  So does that mean this doesn't come out until then?
[05:30.220 --> 05:33.460]  No, this part will come out and I will be updating throughout the summer
[05:33.460 --> 05:34.560]  what our totals are.
[05:34.580 --> 05:35.820]  OK, something we can review.
[05:36.220 --> 05:39.320]  And if you want to maybe, you know, you want to support your movie.
[05:39.820 --> 05:43.220]  If one of us sees Bad Boys and owns it, you know that you're boosting
[05:43.220 --> 05:44.840]  your own totals, right? It's kind of fun.
[05:44.940 --> 05:47.200]  So we're going to so we're going to do this auction
[05:47.200 --> 05:50.720]  and we are going to let the audience know what our numbers are
[05:50.720 --> 05:51.740]  and where we start.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.260]  Yeah, unlike absolutely rip test, which I was willing to do that.
[05:55.380 --> 05:57.320]  And then, uh, right.
[05:57.500 --> 06:01.020]  Well, so, OK, let's do hey, let's do an example one real quick
[06:01.020 --> 06:05.020]  because clearly untitled new line horror is not going to be anything.
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.000]  So what what does this look like for us?
[06:09.040 --> 06:10.960]  Like, what are the steps in this process?
[06:10.960 --> 06:12.520]  Like, walk us through this here.
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.300]  So the steps in the process.
[06:14.480 --> 06:17.580]  Yes. So untitled new line horror probably not going to come out,
[06:17.640 --> 06:18.820]  but it is currently on the schedule.
[06:19.340 --> 06:23.260]  I would say next movie up untitled new line horror.
[06:23.560 --> 06:26.200]  And then somebody would say a number they want to bid for it
[06:26.200 --> 06:27.340]  if they want to bid anything.
[06:28.420 --> 06:31.900]  So I don't know, maybe I would love to just say, for example, I'll say five.
[06:32.480 --> 06:35.460]  OK, then somebody else could say six if they wanted it.
[06:35.500 --> 06:38.800]  And then we just go through that process until we have a max bid
[06:38.800 --> 06:40.440]  and then we move on to the next one.
[06:40.440 --> 06:43.160]  And as you underneath your name, you buy a movie.
[06:43.340 --> 06:46.560]  See, it's 98. Let's say I bought it for six, put it in.
[06:47.240 --> 06:48.400]  It subtracts to 92.
[06:48.820 --> 06:50.520]  So we can keep track of everyone's.
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.460]  OK, it it does the subtracting.
[06:52.580 --> 06:53.880]  Geoff doesn't have to do it in his head.
[06:53.920 --> 06:57.220]  No. OK, OK. You just have to put. Oh, nice. Hang on.
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.300]  But how are we keeping track of the movies?
[06:59.800 --> 07:01.080]  We'll write it, write them down.
[07:01.460 --> 07:02.600]  That's just to write them down.
[07:02.680 --> 07:06.400]  You could either highlight them the color you are or you could just put your name
[07:06.920 --> 07:10.180]  next to like in the B slot or C. I can do that.
[07:10.180 --> 07:11.400]  OK, I'll do that. I'll do that.
[07:11.500 --> 07:13.460]  I'll put them in. I'll put them in the B slot.
[07:13.820 --> 07:16.080]  Yeah, we're saying we like someone else is controlling this.
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.040]  I'm I'm right. We all have access to the document.
[07:19.200 --> 07:21.700]  I just want to make sure that. Oh,
[07:23.100 --> 07:24.420]  it's your screen.
[07:24.880 --> 07:26.720]  That noise is why I asked.
[07:27.740 --> 07:28.940]  I'm rolling on it.
[07:29.980 --> 07:32.520]  OK, I feel I feel comfortable with this.
[07:32.580 --> 07:33.720]  I feel good about this.
[07:35.060 --> 07:36.660]  I feel like we can do it.
[07:36.720 --> 07:37.820]  How do you guys feel about it?
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.980]  Great. I feel super awesome.
[07:40.470 --> 07:42.080]  I forgot. I forgot the last part.
[07:42.260 --> 07:43.820]  The wager, the stakes.
[07:44.080 --> 07:45.320]  I wanted to run this by you.
[07:45.320 --> 07:46.500]  I meant to do this before we recorded.
[07:47.060 --> 07:50.440]  I thought it could be fun that,
[07:51.150 --> 07:53.060]  you know, we have a stage on our discord
[07:53.760 --> 07:56.900]  and we're doing things for like events, community things.
[07:57.580 --> 08:01.120]  Whoever wins this league, maybe we do a live
[08:01.120 --> 08:04.320]  watch along on center stage for the Falcons and up.
[08:05.520 --> 08:08.200]  And whoever wins gets to pick what that movie is.
[08:09.720 --> 08:12.780]  Oh, so we're watching the movie with everyone is what you're saying.
[08:12.980 --> 08:15.460]  Well, we'd be watching a movie on our stage for the people
[08:15.460 --> 08:19.300]  that are in the Falcon tier and above, and whoever wins gets to pick.
[08:19.400 --> 08:21.860]  And we'd be doing it live because it's on the discord stage thing.
[08:21.960 --> 08:24.920]  So people like the first live watch along.
[08:25.060 --> 08:26.880]  Whoever wins gets to pick what that movie is.
[08:27.080 --> 08:29.180]  I like it. I think that's OK with that.
[08:29.800 --> 08:30.920]  Yeah. Or what?
[08:31.520 --> 08:35.680]  What if the lowest person had to wear the red boots at the mall instead of me?
[08:38.360 --> 08:39.660]  No deal. Oh,
[08:41.120 --> 08:41.880]  you know, it's funny.
[08:42.020 --> 08:44.520]  I forgot that you had to do that, but it just reminded me.
[08:44.620 --> 08:47.040]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, absolutely, absolutely.
[08:47.140 --> 08:48.120]  That's what just happened.
[08:48.220 --> 08:49.620]  I'm editing that out of this.
[08:52.260 --> 08:54.080]  We get to go, do we have any other questions?
[08:54.280 --> 08:55.400]  Any questions? Did you have something?
[08:56.100 --> 08:59.180]  So you can buy as many movies as you can afford.
[08:59.240 --> 09:00.120]  Is that right? Absolutely.
[09:00.620 --> 09:03.060]  OK, that's my last. There's all sorts of strategies.
[09:03.180 --> 09:04.960]  Some people stock up on big ones.
[09:05.020 --> 09:06.880]  Some people try to buy as many as they can.
[09:06.880 --> 09:08.820]  Just hope for a lottery ticket, essentially.
[09:09.420 --> 09:09.980]  But I think we're good.
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.540]  Gavin, you have any questions for the typically most confused drafter?
[09:13.920 --> 09:15.520]  I think that's offensive.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.060]  And I understand entirely.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.340]  Oh, yeah.
[09:19.740 --> 09:23.220]  You understand that that you are the most confused drafter
[09:23.220 --> 09:25.940]  or you understand the rules here? Yes.
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.980]  So the first movie on our list is if Eric, if you want to highlight it
[09:33.980 --> 09:36.120]  with your thing, it'll show a poster for the film.
[09:36.120 --> 09:37.520]  You can open it. Here is the movie.
[09:37.540 --> 09:42.320]  If it is a Ryan Reynolds kids film, I'm going to start at five.
[09:42.640 --> 09:43.600]  I put five on this.
[09:44.160 --> 09:45.640]  This comes out on Friday, by the way.
[09:45.980 --> 09:48.980]  Oh, for us. I'll bid for.
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.640]  Well, can't bid below six above six, six and a half.
[09:55.260 --> 09:56.760]  All right. You have, please.
[09:56.940 --> 09:58.740]  Sadly, I have. All right.
[09:58.820 --> 09:59.580]  He's got it.
[10:00.920 --> 10:02.240]  Who said a nine?
[10:02.780 --> 10:04.460]  I said a gap Gavin at nine.
[10:05.020 --> 10:05.600]  I'll take 10.
[10:07.280 --> 10:08.800]  Well, guy with the kid.
[10:09.400 --> 10:11.220]  See, that makes me want to go 11 because you got a kid.
[10:11.280 --> 10:14.300]  I feel like you can have a read on on what movies he does.
[10:14.500 --> 10:15.260]  What do they know?
[10:16.680 --> 10:18.380]  I'm going to I'm going to put out one.
[10:19.540 --> 10:21.780]  So so you're saying what's it at, Andrew?
[10:21.840 --> 10:22.300]  You're at 11.
[10:23.260 --> 10:25.180]  No, no, I'm saying Nick's at 10.
[10:25.240 --> 10:27.340]  I'm going to render off because I'm also the auctioneer of this.
[10:27.340 --> 10:28.620]  So I was saying going once.
[10:29.480 --> 10:31.620]  Oh, going once for Nick at 10.
[10:32.880 --> 10:33.680]  Going twice.
[10:33.680 --> 10:35.780]  Oh, did I fuck up old?
[10:36.140 --> 10:37.500]  Oh, that right under there.
[10:37.560 --> 10:39.880]  I heard it. I heard Geoff got right under the wire.
[10:40.200 --> 10:42.260]  Geoff said 11. Geoff said 11.
[10:42.540 --> 10:43.240]  I was at 11.
[10:44.220 --> 10:44.980]  Do you want to go to 12?
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.180]  You're going to have it going one for Geoff at 11.
[10:49.820 --> 10:51.560]  Twice. Just wanted to sucker someone.
[10:52.500 --> 10:57.600]  Geoff sold Geoff gets if Ryan Reynolds doesn't make movies
[10:57.600 --> 11:01.900]  that don't bring in box office, I'm feeling pretty good.
[11:01.900 --> 11:05.300]  What was the one where he was the digital guy that did pretty bad?
[11:05.720 --> 11:07.220]  Fall guy. Free guy. Free guy.
[11:07.900 --> 11:09.400]  Yeah, but that had laser beam in it.
[11:10.020 --> 11:12.220]  Fun fact about Fall Guy, it didn't do well.
[11:13.020 --> 11:15.340]  Next category. Is that a fun fact?
[11:16.220 --> 11:17.440]  Fun fact about Fall Guy.
[11:17.760 --> 11:21.840]  We had the pitch making content for that thing, and it did not happen.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.140]  Next category, Back to Black.
[11:27.480 --> 11:28.180]  Next film.
[11:28.740 --> 11:31.480]  Back to Black is the Amy Winehouse film.
[11:32.220 --> 11:35.020]  Yeah, I'll I'll put one point on Back to Black.
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.960]  I'll go. I'm good. I'll I'll go to three.
[11:41.040 --> 11:42.120]  Nick's getting into it.
[11:42.960 --> 11:44.060]  I don't think I want to do four.
[11:44.300 --> 11:45.480]  I think I'm out. No, no.
[11:45.580 --> 11:47.580]  Nick is Nick is leading at three.
[11:48.140 --> 11:50.100]  Yeah. Does anyone want Back to Black for more than three?
[11:50.420 --> 11:53.180]  Now, three was the highest I was going to go to.
[11:53.260 --> 11:54.640]  Nick gets Back to Black.
[11:55.180 --> 11:56.720]  Nick, you've been Amy Winehouse guy.
[11:57.440 --> 11:58.700]  Uh, I like her music.
[11:59.100 --> 11:59.780]  My wife likes her.
[11:59.780 --> 12:02.200]  So I know I'm going to tell her to see it like a thousand times.
[12:03.800 --> 12:05.840]  I'm not sure why this is coming out now.
[12:06.260 --> 12:07.600]  Like, that is my main confusion.
[12:07.740 --> 12:12.180]  I mean, I admittedly haven't seen the trailer, but I've read reviews are bad.
[12:12.340 --> 12:16.440]  Uh-huh. And everything on TikTok about it has been,
[12:17.140 --> 12:19.720]  hey, what the fuck is this movie?
[12:20.180 --> 12:21.740]  It is not good.
[12:21.980 --> 12:23.700]  Oh, wow. Yeah, that's fascinating.
[12:23.940 --> 12:28.040]  So I do think there will be a cringe watch factor where some people will go see it.
[12:28.040 --> 12:29.520]  Yeah, but that's it.
[12:29.780 --> 12:33.500]  I will say this now makes me want to see it more than I did going into this.
[12:33.800 --> 12:36.620]  So, Nick, you may, it might work out on the cringe alone.
[12:36.800 --> 12:37.400]  Please do it.
[12:37.440 --> 12:40.260]  Next film, The Strangers, Chapter one,
[12:40.620 --> 12:43.220]  which I believe is the third Strangers film, at least.
[12:43.620 --> 12:44.740]  I think you're right.
[12:44.940 --> 12:49.260]  This is like, is this like a prequel to The Strangers?
[12:49.400 --> 12:50.400]  It has to be right.
[12:50.520 --> 12:52.880]  If it's chapter one, I imagine that's the idea.
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.760]  I'm going to put one.
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.380]  Did you hover over the thing?
[12:56.380 --> 12:58.320]  Oh, here, sorry. Two.
[12:59.380 --> 13:01.320]  There you go. Did that help you?
[13:01.980 --> 13:02.440]  Thanks.
[13:04.940 --> 13:06.560]  Gavin, it's a horror film.
[13:07.160 --> 13:09.280]  It's about random murders.
[13:09.720 --> 13:11.640]  It's about people that watch. Yeah.
[13:12.380 --> 13:14.500]  They watch stuff. They see what happens.
[13:15.900 --> 13:17.700]  Did someone say, did someone say two?
[13:17.880 --> 13:18.640]  I said two.
[13:19.320 --> 13:20.160]  Nick has two.
[13:20.980 --> 13:22.100]  Nick's going for volume.
[13:22.660 --> 13:25.280]  Is Nick going to lock this in with two?
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.700]  I'll say four.
[13:27.740 --> 13:29.300]  Oh, Eric coming in with four.
[13:29.840 --> 13:31.520]  Anyone going to go higher than four?
[13:31.620 --> 13:32.220]  We got four.
[13:32.620 --> 13:35.700]  We're locking in four, four going one, four going twice.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.240]  Sold to Eric at four.
[13:39.800 --> 13:40.800]  That's a good pick, Eric. Eric on the board.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.020]  Have you seen any of the Stranger movies, Eric?
[13:43.400 --> 13:46.340]  No, but I know that they are like cult hits.
[13:46.760 --> 13:48.600]  Yeah, the first one was huge.
[13:48.880 --> 13:49.560]  The first one was great.
[13:49.560 --> 13:51.760]  So I'm pretty, you know, so so.
[13:51.780 --> 13:54.540]  You put a watcher on a movie and it's probably good for 30 million.
[13:55.720 --> 14:03.440]  And now, arguably, the first big movie, Furiosa, a Mad Max saga.
[14:03.820 --> 14:04.420]  I'm going to put ten.
[14:05.180 --> 14:05.720]  Shit. Wow.
[14:05.900 --> 14:07.360]  But that was Gavin.
[14:07.480 --> 14:08.560]  Yeah, there's 11 to Andrew.
[14:10.160 --> 14:10.760]  Fifteen.
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.740]  Oh, wow.
[14:13.620 --> 14:14.140]  Fifteen.
[14:14.640 --> 14:15.960]  It's not a great trailer.
[14:17.680 --> 14:19.520]  Uh, I haven't seen it.
[14:20.880 --> 14:22.920]  Oh, man, that could be a steel 16.
[14:24.740 --> 14:28.880]  Oh, yeah, 16 going one out on your time.
[14:29.240 --> 14:30.840]  Now you're up to one at 15.
[14:31.600 --> 14:35.260]  Really? We locked in at 16 for this.
[14:35.520 --> 14:37.580]  I'll go 17. 17.
[14:37.880 --> 14:40.700]  OK, 17. Well, that's too rich for my blood.
[14:40.740 --> 14:42.240]  So unless someone wants to go over Eric.
[14:43.400 --> 14:45.260]  Eric at 17 going one.
[14:47.120 --> 14:50.000]  Twice sold to Eric at 17.
[14:50.560 --> 14:53.400]  I'll take that could be a fantastic buy for you.
[14:53.500 --> 14:55.440]  I can easily see that being huge.
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.940]  I can't. I can see it going well, but I can also see it not going.
[15:00.120 --> 15:00.460]  Yes.
[15:01.420 --> 15:02.840]  I think you'll be good.
[15:03.520 --> 15:05.760]  I think it's going to make a bunch.
[15:05.980 --> 15:07.880]  I think it'll make way more internationally.
[15:08.300 --> 15:11.160]  Talk about not striking while the iron's hot.
[15:11.520 --> 15:15.220]  This is the last one came out in 2000.
[15:16.540 --> 15:18.240]  15, 15, 2015.
[15:18.240 --> 15:20.820]  Yeah. Oh, almost 10 years, dude.
[15:21.080 --> 15:24.380]  Look at the gap between the last one and the road or Mad Max.
[15:24.740 --> 15:29.520]  That's true. But like, but like the bigger gap makes me more confident.
[15:29.900 --> 15:31.780]  The smaller gap make me small, confident.
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.260]  So to be fair, this one has a better movie behind it than the last one did.
[15:35.580 --> 15:37.180]  That is absolutely true.
[15:37.200 --> 15:40.820]  But that could also lead to a lot of disappointment in what we're about to see,
[15:40.860 --> 15:44.840]  which is Chris Helms Helmsworth in a big fucking nose for some reason.
[15:44.840 --> 15:47.900]  Yeah, very weird.
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.520]  Gavin is half of that.
[15:49.580 --> 15:51.660]  Um, there's a next movie.
[15:51.960 --> 15:52.700]  Oh, I'm excited.
[15:53.420 --> 15:54.940]  The Garfield movie.
[15:55.140 --> 15:58.380]  Well, I'm immediately going to fuck out of here of 110.
[15:58.580 --> 16:02.260]  I'm putting 10. Whoa, and you're out of your fucking mind.
[16:04.560 --> 16:07.580]  I mean, listen, didn't they already make one of these?
[16:07.740 --> 16:09.560]  They made seven. Calm down to Back to Black.
[16:09.860 --> 16:11.000]  I don't want to hear from you.
[16:11.400 --> 16:13.360]  Garfield is worth more than seven.
[16:13.360 --> 16:15.140]  And difference to Back to Black.
[16:15.580 --> 16:17.120]  OK, there's a wider gap.
[16:17.620 --> 16:22.100]  Now, now I do want to point out before we start, like before he's saying 10.
[16:22.220 --> 16:24.360]  Totally fine. For some reason, you're at 91.
[16:26.060 --> 16:27.580]  And I don't know why that is.
[16:28.060 --> 16:30.200]  And I may have taxed him slightly before we started.
[16:32.860 --> 16:36.320]  We'll just we'll put in a number anyway that reflects to what it would be
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.400]  if I was at 98, 10, 10 going one.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.320]  That seems so much worse instead of just changing the top one up to 90.
[16:43.500 --> 16:44.960]  There you go. Oh, that works. Thanks.
[16:45.080 --> 16:46.640]  I am. Oh, my God.
[16:46.660 --> 16:48.220]  Going twice. Benevolent.
[16:49.020 --> 16:52.840]  Eleven. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[16:53.120 --> 16:56.800]  Uh, uh, Garfield cart guy, what do you think?
[16:57.180 --> 16:58.620]  Oh, I really want it.
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.220]  Got Chris Pratt and Samuel L.
[17:01.220 --> 17:03.340]  Jackson, all your kids' favorite voice actors.
[17:03.520 --> 17:04.840]  Twelve. I'll go twelve.
[17:05.160 --> 17:07.280]  Oh, twelve. I really want it.
[17:07.280 --> 17:09.640]  I knew it'd be easy to get that dude to bid up.
[17:10.240 --> 17:13.060]  I want it. I got to have it.
[17:13.500 --> 17:15.280]  Going on. Now you're going to pay for it.
[17:15.380 --> 17:17.300]  HF like a fiddle. Going twice.
[17:18.840 --> 17:20.520]  It's all sold to me.
[17:20.800 --> 17:21.900]  I'm getting Garfield.
[17:22.200 --> 17:23.020]  You got Garfield.
[17:23.860 --> 17:28.500]  I did. I mean, Chris Pratt is on a run of animated hits.
[17:29.140 --> 17:31.620]  Why would it stop? Jurassic Park.
[17:32.400 --> 17:33.900]  The next film is Sight.
[17:34.080 --> 17:35.800]  I think it's some religious bullshit.
[17:35.800 --> 17:37.480]  I don't know. I don't really know.
[17:38.120 --> 17:39.820]  I think it's a wide release.
[17:40.180 --> 17:43.120]  It is a I think Greg Kinnear.
[17:43.520 --> 17:44.520]  Yeah. Yeah, it is.
[17:44.600 --> 17:45.740]  It is a Greg Kinnear vehicle.
[17:45.880 --> 17:48.600]  I'll put one point on the Greg Kinnear vehicle.
[17:48.840 --> 17:49.420]  I'll do two.
[17:51.300 --> 17:53.620]  That's that's richer than I would pay.
[17:54.260 --> 17:57.780]  I I really are we going to let Nick have Sight
[17:57.780 --> 18:00.280]  and Back to Black as his first two films?
[18:00.380 --> 18:01.340]  I really guess we are.
[18:01.640 --> 18:02.380]  And yeah, absolutely.
[18:02.440 --> 18:04.300]  I don't know. I don't know who you think we is.
[18:04.300 --> 18:06.940]  I'm getting them at Steele's on the dollar.
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.660]  Yeah, that's sold to Nick for two points.
[18:10.340 --> 18:11.780]  Excellent. Way to go, buddy.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.440]  Nick's shopping a Dollar Tree right now.
[18:13.580 --> 18:16.980]  Yeah, baby. This candy is out of date.
[18:18.120 --> 18:22.620]  OK, next film doesn't even have a box office mojo page, but it is coming out.
[18:22.700 --> 18:26.540]  It is a Bobby kind of volley film with Robert De Niro about him
[18:26.540 --> 18:29.340]  having a kid with special needs, I believe.
[18:29.920 --> 18:31.480]  Oh, I'll pay all one. One.
[18:32.200 --> 18:34.080]  I'll go to three.
[18:34.140 --> 18:35.780]  Oh, is it going to be Oscar buzz?
[18:36.800 --> 18:38.280]  Mm, I'm not going more than three.
[18:38.500 --> 18:42.800]  Also, also in this movie, Vera Farminga
[18:42.800 --> 18:46.760]  and Robert De Niro and Rose Byrne
[18:46.760 --> 18:49.920]  and Rainn Wilson and Whoopi Goldberg.
[18:50.500 --> 18:52.960]  But it's also we're just going off box office, right?
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.180]  So Oscar movies typically do shit at the box office anyway.
[18:56.620 --> 18:58.220]  They also don't typically come out in the summer.
[18:58.480 --> 19:00.660]  Yeah. What? So what are we at?
[19:00.660 --> 19:02.020]  I think you're at three.
[19:02.280 --> 19:04.180]  I'm at three. Going once, going twice.
[19:04.320 --> 19:04.900]  Anybody know?
[19:06.500 --> 19:07.280]  Sold to Geoff.
[19:07.700 --> 19:09.080]  Three points. Congratulations, Geoff.
[19:09.140 --> 19:09.800]  I didn't know I could.
[19:09.820 --> 19:12.340]  I didn't know I could control the numbers.
[19:13.900 --> 19:17.120]  We had the whole discussion at the beginning and then I started writing far
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.780]  and I changed Andrew's score down.
[19:22.660 --> 19:25.580]  OK, next film is I don't really know anything about this.
[19:25.740 --> 19:28.960]  It's called Haikyuu, the dumpster battle.
[19:28.960 --> 19:30.840]  This is released overseas.
[19:30.840 --> 19:32.660]  Did actually really well overseas.
[19:32.800 --> 19:34.420]  Well, I mean, like 65 million.
[19:34.740 --> 19:35.160]  Does that count?
[19:35.360 --> 19:39.440]  This is the no, but this is the North American release of it.
[19:39.940 --> 19:40.740]  To the one point.
[19:41.020 --> 19:42.840]  OK, I already said to Andrew. Don't. Wow.
[19:42.840 --> 19:44.220]  Yeah, you beat me. You have lost it.
[19:44.280 --> 19:46.360]  Your neck, your number has to go above my number. Get real.
[19:46.580 --> 19:47.960]  Yeah, that is factual.
[19:48.380 --> 19:50.860]  Does anyone want to get involved in this dumpster battle?
[19:51.080 --> 19:52.960]  That's OK. No. OK.
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.260]  Going once or twice.
[19:55.720 --> 19:57.360]  Sold to Eric for two.
[19:57.880 --> 20:00.640]  I think this one's going to be an underdog for me.
[20:00.740 --> 20:04.720]  I think it's going to I think they're going to do not like huge wide releases
[20:04.720 --> 20:08.760]  here, but I think they'll do like those one night only things or whatever.
[20:08.960 --> 20:10.440]  And I think it'll do decent.
[20:10.620 --> 20:13.680]  I think if you get like 10 million out of that for two points, that's
[20:13.680 --> 20:14.380]  that's nothing wrong.
[20:14.520 --> 20:16.640]  I definitely I definitely think that's what's going to be.
[20:16.700 --> 20:18.740]  Are you going to write down the points for Eric?
[20:18.860 --> 20:20.120]  Nobody's written down the points yet.
[20:22.540 --> 20:23.620]  Two. Thank you.
[20:24.980 --> 20:26.880]  I was locked in a bad boy's ride or die
[20:26.880 --> 20:30.920]  thinking about if TPG was here, we got 98 points going to bad boy's ride or die.
[20:31.020 --> 20:32.360]  You think he'd throw down on 98?
[20:32.680 --> 20:36.060]  Oh, yeah, I think I mean, by the way, Kevin has no movies right now.
[20:36.100 --> 20:36.640]  I got three.
[20:37.120 --> 20:39.260]  Well, I don't want to let pilot dog shit. I'm going big.
[20:39.960 --> 20:41.440]  Oh, is this is this your money?
[20:41.580 --> 20:44.180]  Here you go. Is it any bigger than bad boys?
[20:44.260 --> 20:45.280]  Seven. I want one.
[20:45.860 --> 20:50.500]  I'm mad. I want to making them now and not in like 2005 when we wanted them.
[20:50.700 --> 20:51.980]  Oh, totally agree. Yeah. When we want.
[20:52.080 --> 20:54.060]  Yeah, I get striking while the iron is not hot.
[20:54.060 --> 20:57.160]  When they get when they could jump over a fence still.
[20:57.300 --> 20:59.980]  Yeah. I got eight.
[21:00.720 --> 21:03.200]  You put eight. I put eight down.
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.560]  Interesting. Twelve.
[21:07.700 --> 21:12.600]  Whoa. Oh, listen, I'm not paying a Garfield for it.
[21:12.640 --> 21:13.740]  I'm out at 12.
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.600]  Gavin with 12 going once.
[21:16.240 --> 21:17.780]  Jerry Bruckheimer produced.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.620]  Going with Gavin twice.
[21:20.720 --> 21:23.600]  My mouth broke. Sold to Gavin at 12.
[21:23.600 --> 21:25.720]  All right. Nice way to go, Gavin.
[21:25.820 --> 21:27.440]  Well done, Gavin. And D-Box.
[21:28.120 --> 21:29.880]  Oh, DX, baby, man.
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.720]  I go see it with you, but I don't want to help you.
[21:33.520 --> 21:35.400]  We'll sneak in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.800]  Next movie is The Watchers.
[21:38.300 --> 21:41.200]  I believe it is directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter.
[21:41.580 --> 21:43.040]  Weird horror looking thing.
[21:43.340 --> 21:45.840]  Oh, I'll put three points down.
[21:46.620 --> 21:47.440]  Three. All right.
[21:47.580 --> 21:49.660]  I'll do hit. I'm a bully.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.480]  Geoff's at four. I'll go five.
[21:53.080 --> 21:57.160]  Oh. No, it's a Warner Brothers picture.
[21:58.540 --> 22:02.320]  Oh, fuck. Five going once.
[22:04.080 --> 22:07.120]  I'm going twice. I just don't want it sold.
[22:07.600 --> 22:10.460]  You fooled me. We got to get you a little gavel.
[22:11.580 --> 22:12.780]  I do need a gavel.
[22:12.880 --> 22:14.280]  I have one. You want me to use it?
[22:14.280 --> 22:15.040]  Do you want to use it?
[22:15.100 --> 22:16.900]  Yeah, what is the score? Just clip it out.
[22:17.520 --> 22:19.240]  Whatever address is sold, you just whack it.
[22:19.720 --> 22:21.220]  Do you want me to whack? Hang on just a second.
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.040]  Oh, that's great.
[22:27.120 --> 22:28.480]  It's great. OK, that's fantastic.
[22:28.940 --> 22:29.660]  I have a gavel.
[22:30.220 --> 22:32.280]  Inside out to one.
[22:33.420 --> 22:34.760]  Ten. Six. Twenty.
[22:34.900 --> 22:36.540]  God damn it. What? Twenty one.
[22:37.660 --> 22:38.620]  Twenty five.
[22:38.840 --> 22:40.140]  They're right to play. Twenty seven.
[22:40.920 --> 22:43.080]  Thirty. Thirty five.
[22:43.520 --> 22:43.880]  Forty.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.320]  Forty four.
[22:51.040 --> 22:51.520]  Whoa.
[22:52.280 --> 22:54.140]  Wow. Forty five.
[22:57.220 --> 23:00.540]  Whoa, Gavin just pulled his dick out of his pants.
[23:01.280 --> 23:03.500]  Come on. You got forty six in there, Andrew?
[23:03.580 --> 23:05.860]  No, I don't. I don't.
[23:05.960 --> 23:06.860]  No is too big for me.
[23:07.300 --> 23:08.920]  All right, Nick, you want to jump in here?
[23:09.580 --> 23:11.340]  Nope. What?
[23:11.700 --> 23:13.320]  OK, it's going once.
[23:14.360 --> 23:15.320]  Going twice.
[23:16.360 --> 23:18.200]  Sold to Gavin at forty five.
[23:18.380 --> 23:19.340]  That's the old wallet.
[23:19.340 --> 23:21.100]  They also didn't strike when the iron was hot.
[23:23.200 --> 23:26.260]  But like, there's no way that's not one of the biggest movies of the summer.
[23:26.300 --> 23:27.740]  No, that is a huge film.
[23:27.900 --> 23:29.440]  It's going to be a great use of money.
[23:29.520 --> 23:30.780]  It's going to be huge.
[23:31.200 --> 23:32.020]  Pixar sequel.
[23:33.300 --> 23:34.180]  Next movie.
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.200]  OK, now, Bike Riders is an Austin Butler vehicle.
[23:41.880 --> 23:47.460]  It also has Norman Reedus, Michael Shannon and Tom Hardy.
[23:47.460 --> 23:52.600]  One. It is a motorcycle movie.
[23:53.140 --> 23:55.580]  And my understanding is that this movie came out.
[23:56.520 --> 23:59.000]  In like limited release last year.
[23:59.500 --> 24:00.080]  And oh, really?
[24:00.240 --> 24:01.840]  But yeah, but it's released, I think.
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.380]  And then it's releasing wide.
[24:04.040 --> 24:05.100]  How'd they come up with that name?
[24:05.360 --> 24:07.700]  Right. It's kind of lame for a motorcycle movie.
[24:08.140 --> 24:09.360]  It's incredibly lame.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.640]  Nothing to do with motorcycles, actually.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.340]  OK, so what do you guys think?
[24:16.340 --> 24:17.380]  Bike Riders.
[24:17.540 --> 24:19.820]  Why Fast and Furious was called The Car Drivers.
[24:22.280 --> 24:24.580]  I'd be watching Car Drivers 9, baby.
[24:24.860 --> 24:27.900]  You mean drive or baby driver?
[24:28.580 --> 24:30.960]  Oh, Bike Riders.
[24:31.120 --> 24:32.020]  I'll put two.
[24:32.920 --> 24:35.060]  I'll do three. Oh, OK.
[24:35.100 --> 24:36.300]  Well, that's beyond me now.
[24:36.420 --> 24:37.220]  Nick at three.
[24:37.860 --> 24:40.960]  I'll do Bike Riders for Geoff.
[24:41.100 --> 24:42.320]  All right. Anyone at five?
[24:42.980 --> 24:44.180]  Geoff currently leading with four.
[24:44.900 --> 24:46.680]  Austin Butler vehicle, Mr. Elvis.
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.380]  I was going to say it's tough because I I want to.
[24:51.200 --> 24:53.840]  But boy, I just don't think it's going to crush.
[24:54.160 --> 24:56.660]  I just don't think it's going to bring in enough money.
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.580]  I think it'll be acclaimed in some circles,
[24:58.580 --> 25:00.300]  but I just don't think it's going to bring in the money.
[25:00.740 --> 25:02.320]  Then Bike Riders going twice it up.
[25:03.680 --> 25:04.880]  Bike Riders sold to Geoff.
[25:04.940 --> 25:05.560]  What was that for?
[25:06.040 --> 25:06.700]  Yeah. For Geoff.
[25:07.660 --> 25:09.600]  Yep. Like not a bad one.
[25:09.700 --> 25:11.800]  You just deleted my one above you.
[25:12.020 --> 25:13.360]  It was three. What the hell, dude?
[25:13.360 --> 25:14.800]  I sure did.
[25:15.080 --> 25:15.620]  Come on.
[25:16.220 --> 25:18.220]  While I appreciate it, I'm not trying to cheat here.
[25:18.360 --> 25:20.100]  No. I am.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.420]  Janet Planet.
[25:25.020 --> 25:25.620]  I don't know.
[25:26.560 --> 25:29.220]  Enthralled by her own imagination.
[25:29.680 --> 25:33.220]  Eleven year old Lacey spends the long summer at home
[25:33.220 --> 25:38.180]  with her mother and three strangers, Julianne Nicholson, Zoe Ziegler.
[25:39.960 --> 25:41.160]  Elias Koteas.
[25:41.160 --> 25:42.600]  That's the only guy that likes...
[25:42.600 --> 25:43.460]  Elias Koteas, yeah.
[25:43.860 --> 25:45.500]  Koteas, yeah, that guy. Yeah, yeah, that guy.
[25:45.960 --> 25:48.360]  And that's sort of it rounding out the cast.
[25:48.640 --> 25:49.820]  I'd like to rescind my one.
[25:50.960 --> 25:53.480]  You can't. One is on the board for Nick.
[25:53.600 --> 25:53.980]  No!
[25:54.900 --> 25:57.680]  Elias Koteas is the guy who's almost Christopher Maloney.
[25:58.160 --> 25:58.820]  Yes, he is.
[25:59.040 --> 26:00.380]  That's a great descriptor of him.
[26:00.560 --> 26:02.300]  I'll put two down on this.
[26:02.580 --> 26:04.020]  Oh, sweet. Thank you for saving me.
[26:04.020 --> 26:06.160]  Eric putting two down on Janet Planet.
[26:06.360 --> 26:08.140]  I don't think anyone else wants it beyond that, Eric.
[26:08.200 --> 26:09.000]  Not Nick.
[26:09.000 --> 26:09.780]  Yeah, we're coming in.
[26:10.420 --> 26:12.420]  Eric gets Janet Planet at two.
[26:12.800 --> 26:13.880]  Yeah, I'm fine with that.
[26:14.100 --> 26:14.880]  I got no problem with that.
[26:15.720 --> 26:17.520]  Next film, Blue Lock.
[26:17.660 --> 26:18.020]  One!
[26:18.340 --> 26:19.360]  Episode. OK.
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.120]  What the fuck?
[26:22.920 --> 26:27.080]  So once again, another one of these anime movies that released internationally.
[26:27.240 --> 26:30.820]  This one did not nearly nearly as good as the Dumpster Battle.
[26:31.500 --> 26:32.740]  I'm not going to put two in.
[26:33.920 --> 26:35.580]  I think, Nick, you might have this at one.
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.680]  Cool. You might have the only one purchase.
[26:37.680 --> 26:38.840]  We good with that?
[26:39.120 --> 26:40.060]  No, I'm good.
[26:40.080 --> 26:42.700]  OK, let's move on to the next one from Nick.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.920]  Gavin, could I convince you otherwise?
[26:46.360 --> 26:49.400]  Nick has bought four films for a total of eight points.
[26:49.500 --> 26:51.140]  He really is at the Dollarama.
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.100]  That's good value.
[26:52.440 --> 26:53.220]  That's great value.
[26:53.940 --> 26:55.240]  He's got 90 bucks left.
[26:56.120 --> 26:58.520]  We have now moved on to...
[27:01.020 --> 27:03.540]  Kevin Costner's three hour, two part
[27:04.060 --> 27:08.940]  Wild West, epic, Horizon and American Saga, chapter one, ten hour.
[27:09.800 --> 27:11.180]  Whoa. Ten?
[27:12.440 --> 27:13.480]  Holy shit.
[27:13.540 --> 27:15.420]  I think Nick said 11. I did.
[27:16.160 --> 27:17.960]  Wow. I'll go 15.
[27:18.340 --> 27:21.420]  Oh, shit. It looks like a stinker.
[27:21.720 --> 27:23.400]  Gavin. 16. They're crazy, right?
[27:23.560 --> 27:25.340]  Oh, I'll go. I'll go 19.
[27:25.680 --> 27:27.180]  I wouldn't have gone above four for this.
[27:27.260 --> 27:28.480]  I think I'll go 22.
[27:29.520 --> 27:32.260]  Wow. They know something I don't.
[27:33.540 --> 27:34.940]  Geoff with the top bid at 22.
[27:35.400 --> 27:38.020]  Going once, going twice.
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.120]  Sold to Geoff for 22 points.
[27:41.300 --> 27:45.760]  Dude, Kevin Costner is so fucking hot right now with all that cowboy shit
[27:45.760 --> 27:46.980]  and Yellowstone and all that stuff.
[27:47.260 --> 27:49.600]  There's no way I'm not betting on Yellowstone.
[27:50.020 --> 27:52.660]  There's no way I'm not betting on fucking Fox.
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.640]  Now, that's all they show is Kevin Costner commercials.
[27:55.820 --> 27:57.340]  Yeah. It has a colon and a hyphen.
[27:57.900 --> 28:00.140]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it is part one.
[28:00.140 --> 28:04.560]  It doesn't the the rest of the movie doesn't come out until like later this year.
[28:04.660 --> 28:08.520]  This is also Kevin Costner while going through a divorce, I believe.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.740]  And the budget is 100 million dollars.
[28:12.080 --> 28:15.660]  Oh, very strange.
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.500]  It will be the postman, maybe, but it might be dances with wolves.
[28:19.660 --> 28:21.880]  It might be. I'm ready to take the chance.
[28:22.460 --> 28:24.620]  OK. Kevin Costner is hot right now.
[28:24.980 --> 28:26.540]  Quiet Place, day one.
[28:26.880 --> 28:28.460]  They're still making Quiet Place movie.
[28:28.460 --> 28:31.320]  Ten. Wow. Ten. Ten points.
[28:32.080 --> 28:33.200]  Oh, man, there's a time.
[28:33.480 --> 28:37.560]  If you use Quiet Place to add up, if you add up what Nick has spent,
[28:40.200 --> 28:41.480]  doesn't even reach ten.
[28:42.620 --> 28:43.620]  Yeah, I'm OK.
[28:43.820 --> 28:46.020]  And Quiet Place two or whatever.
[28:46.480 --> 28:49.040]  You know, the movie going once for Nick at ten.
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.320]  Just striking when the iron is ice cold, like going twice at ten for Nick.
[28:54.600 --> 28:55.720]  The second one did well, I think.
[28:55.880 --> 28:58.320]  Yeah. Sold to Nick at ten.
[28:58.460 --> 29:00.280]  He finally has a real movie.
[29:00.440 --> 29:02.520]  Congratulations. Hey, fuck you.
[29:08.060 --> 29:12.700]  Now, ten, maybe the 11th is big will be for 20.
[29:15.080 --> 29:19.900]  Oh, 21, 22, 25.
[29:21.260 --> 29:23.200]  It's going to make a lot of money, son of a bitch.
[29:23.360 --> 29:24.040]  Twenty six. Twenty eight.
[29:24.040 --> 29:25.640]  Ah, twenty nine.
[29:27.260 --> 29:28.220]  Thirty one.
[29:30.800 --> 29:31.520]  Thirty two.
[29:33.300 --> 29:34.560]  You know, what's going to be?
[29:35.460 --> 29:37.020]  What do you guys finish this? Thirty four.
[29:37.860 --> 29:39.580]  Forty one. Fucking hell.
[29:39.820 --> 29:43.440]  Whoa. Oh, knock some out if this is it.
[29:43.700 --> 29:45.900]  Oh, if you let him have it.
[29:46.020 --> 29:46.660]  Gavin is out.
[29:49.740 --> 29:52.080]  Consider. Consider what Gavin already has.
[29:52.220 --> 29:53.100]  How many things are left here?
[29:53.720 --> 29:55.720]  Oh, shit. I'm going to say forty two.
[29:56.160 --> 29:57.100]  Forty three. Wow.
[29:58.160 --> 30:00.820]  Sorry, Gavin. Forty three. Forty three. Forty three.
[30:01.080 --> 30:03.640]  Wow. Why are you so decisive?
[30:03.860 --> 30:06.360]  God damn it. Forty. Forty five.
[30:07.260 --> 30:09.760]  Whoa. I want these minions.
[30:10.260 --> 30:10.840]  Forty six.
[30:12.740 --> 30:13.440]  Oh, my God.
[30:13.780 --> 30:15.300]  You could have the lunchbox money, too.
[30:15.880 --> 30:16.640]  Forty eight.
[30:17.920 --> 30:19.180]  This is crazy.
[30:20.100 --> 30:22.140]  It's going to make three hundred million dollars.
[30:22.140 --> 30:22.700]  Forty nine.
[30:24.100 --> 30:24.480]  Fifty.
[30:25.060 --> 30:26.600]  I think I won that.
[30:27.360 --> 30:27.740]  Fifty one.
[30:29.660 --> 30:30.380]  Fifty four.
[30:37.060 --> 30:38.000]  Fifty eight.
[30:38.940 --> 30:39.440]  Whoa!
[30:42.000 --> 30:42.720]  Sixty.
[30:43.140 --> 30:43.460]  Fuck!
[30:44.100 --> 30:44.220]  Whoa!
[30:46.060 --> 30:48.600]  This got interesting.
[30:49.160 --> 30:50.580]  Hold on, let me look at the list.
[30:51.640 --> 30:53.660]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[30:54.880 --> 30:57.000]  Oh, 60 going one.
[30:57.000 --> 30:57.760]  Sixty one.
[30:58.680 --> 30:59.560]  Sixty two.
[31:00.320 --> 31:01.500]  Oh, sixty three.
[31:03.800 --> 31:07.020]  Nick, you could take Andrew all the way up to 80 and he's still going to put in
[31:07.020 --> 31:08.960]  sixty four. Eighty.
[31:10.900 --> 31:14.740]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[31:14.740 --> 31:17.420]  Wow. Gavin's dick out and waving around.
[31:17.720 --> 31:20.040]  All right, Andrew, this is your shot.
[31:20.420 --> 31:21.860]  Wow. Eighty.
[31:22.600 --> 31:24.840]  You get eighty one this thing or what?
[31:25.300 --> 31:26.580]  This is amazing.
[31:27.200 --> 31:28.760]  No, I think I'm good, Nick.
[31:28.800 --> 31:31.540]  You get it at 80. Nick is out of the game.
[31:31.820 --> 31:33.620]  Oh, holy shit.
[31:34.120 --> 31:36.600]  Nick is somehow out of the game and has the most movies.
[31:37.360 --> 31:40.160]  Nick's spending is insane.
[31:40.440 --> 31:42.940]  It is ridiculous. Three, two, two, one.
[31:43.200 --> 31:44.120]  Ten. Eighty.
[31:44.660 --> 31:45.180]  Phenomenal.
[31:47.280 --> 31:48.320]  Absolutely amazing.
[31:48.500 --> 31:50.240]  I bet it's going to pay off tremendously.
[31:50.500 --> 31:51.300]  Oh, absolutely.
[31:51.300 --> 31:56.260]  Let me say, I'm sort of not sure about this auction to begin with.
[31:56.340 --> 31:57.940]  Oh my God. Love this format.
[31:58.240 --> 31:59.540]  Like, you would not believe.
[31:59.860 --> 32:02.180]  What else can we do this for?
[32:02.540 --> 32:06.080]  I am so excited not only to find out who wins,
[32:06.440 --> 32:11.420]  but when we get to look over the data and figure out who had the worst bet
[32:11.420 --> 32:15.020]  on a movie, like who lost the most percentage wise, and then what was like
[32:15.020 --> 32:19.100]  the most like the two dollar movie that made eight hundred million dollars.
[32:19.100 --> 32:22.780]  We should have a video where we we sit around a conference table
[32:22.780 --> 32:25.480]  as if we're the studios and deal with our losses.
[32:25.980 --> 32:26.640]  I love that.
[32:26.760 --> 32:28.720]  Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
[32:29.240 --> 32:31.460]  OK, next up, Nick is out.
[32:32.120 --> 32:34.540]  Nick is out. Next movie is Maxine.
[32:34.940 --> 32:36.300]  Triple X on the Maxine.
[32:36.680 --> 32:37.840]  It's an A24 film.
[32:38.160 --> 32:39.240]  That's about all I know.
[32:40.440 --> 32:42.680]  Three, four, five.
[32:46.850 --> 32:48.050]  Seven. Whoa.
[32:48.050 --> 32:51.070]  Oh, seven, one.
[32:53.090 --> 32:54.990]  Seven going twice, eight.
[32:56.170 --> 32:59.630]  Whoa. Oh, too rich for my blood.
[32:59.810 --> 33:02.050]  It's it's a it's going to do well going one.
[33:02.270 --> 33:03.930]  I can't go twice.
[33:05.030 --> 33:08.210]  So it's like it's like the third movie in a series.
[33:08.350 --> 33:10.070]  Yeah. Mia Goth movie thing.
[33:10.190 --> 33:12.650]  It's yeah, I think those movies
[33:13.930 --> 33:16.870]  suck out loud and people love them.
[33:16.870 --> 33:20.070]  So I know I'm wrong and I got no problem
[33:20.070 --> 33:21.610]  winning some money on it, baby.
[33:21.770 --> 33:23.070]  Yeah, let's do it.
[33:23.270 --> 33:24.670]  I think I need to the moon.
[33:25.130 --> 33:27.570]  This is a Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson film
[33:27.570 --> 33:29.230]  about the moon landing being fake.
[33:29.350 --> 33:30.850]  I believe. Oh, yes.
[33:30.950 --> 33:35.030]  Oh, sort of fake like them filming the moon landing in the event
[33:35.030 --> 33:37.550]  that it doesn't work or something, I think is the idea.
[33:38.050 --> 33:39.970]  I want to say this might be an Apple movie.
[33:40.330 --> 33:43.010]  I'll put one. Apple love a good moon movie.
[33:43.010 --> 33:44.630]  Mm hmm. Movie.
[33:45.550 --> 33:46.630]  Andrew, you say one.
[33:46.910 --> 33:49.430]  I said one. I'm putting one on flying in the moon.
[33:50.950 --> 33:52.490]  To go to three.
[33:52.630 --> 33:57.150]  Oh, oh, Andrew, it's for intrigue like a four.
[33:58.910 --> 34:01.710]  Four going once or going twice.
[34:03.410 --> 34:04.510]  I got it at four.
[34:06.150 --> 34:08.370]  I have zero enthusiasm about that.
[34:08.630 --> 34:10.110]  Oh, yeah, whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:10.110 --> 34:12.850]  It's four. OK, untitled new line horror.
[34:12.850 --> 34:15.730]  Anyone. So this is on a schedule.
[34:16.450 --> 34:21.970]  And I will say when you search for it, it is rumored to be a David Chase
[34:21.970 --> 34:24.190]  Terrence Winter Horror film. One.
[34:26.190 --> 34:29.350]  But that's it's a rumor, it's not a like it is not.
[34:29.430 --> 34:31.430]  Yeah, you are. It could easily move out.
[34:31.610 --> 34:36.070]  And if I have a summer, I understand that I'm taking a I'm taking a risk here
[34:36.070 --> 34:36.770]  with my one.
[34:37.090 --> 34:39.830]  If one of these gets delayed beyond summer, do we get a refund?
[34:40.390 --> 34:42.530]  No, you're just fucked. You just don't get that movie.
[34:42.930 --> 34:46.050]  Yeah. Oh, one. I'll do one on this one.
[34:47.410 --> 34:50.150]  I think Eric's going to or Geoff's going to get it. Yeah.
[34:51.350 --> 34:52.550]  Yeah, I just wouldn't play Geoff.
[34:52.710 --> 34:54.390]  I won. I just wouldn't put anything on tape.
[34:54.750 --> 34:56.370]  It's a hell of a lottery ticket for one.
[34:56.990 --> 34:58.630]  Yeah, if it comes out, you're in a great position.
[34:58.810 --> 35:01.290]  What do we what do you what were you saying you think it was?
[35:02.150 --> 35:06.170]  It is supposed to be David Chase Terrence Winter Horror film.
[35:07.290 --> 35:08.730]  When I looked into it.
[35:09.010 --> 35:11.230]  I'm just going to note it here so that way we remember.
[35:11.230 --> 35:13.350]  But yeah, that's great.
[35:13.870 --> 35:16.330]  Next film, which makes me sad, Twisters.
[35:16.810 --> 35:19.970]  Oh boy. Is it a trailer for this yet?
[35:20.230 --> 35:22.410]  No, no, I haven't. It is. Yeah.
[35:23.290 --> 35:26.090]  It's a sequel in a way.
[35:26.470 --> 35:28.090]  It just seems like it's another.
[35:28.410 --> 35:30.050]  It seems like it's the same movie.
[35:31.230 --> 35:33.350]  It is very bizarre. Huh?
[35:34.410 --> 35:37.290]  I feel like the title implies that it is a continuation,
[35:37.690 --> 35:41.150]  but everybody is dead, sadly, that was in that first movie.
[35:41.230 --> 35:43.530]  So, yeah. Helen Hunt is not dead, is she?
[35:43.770 --> 35:44.510]  Helen Hunt is not dead.
[35:44.910 --> 35:46.370]  But Phil Seymour Hoffman's dead.
[35:49.190 --> 35:50.230]  Bill Paxton's dead.
[35:50.570 --> 35:51.350]  His son's dead either.
[35:51.910 --> 35:54.030]  That cow died. The cow's dead.
[35:54.330 --> 35:55.090]  Cow, yeah. Cow, yeah.
[35:55.250 --> 35:56.870]  I'll I'll put two on it.
[35:58.990 --> 35:59.390]  I'll put.
[36:00.370 --> 36:01.690]  I don't know, I'm good.
[36:02.250 --> 36:03.470]  I'll put three on it.
[36:05.430 --> 36:07.290]  Four. Four.
[36:07.980 --> 36:08.750]  Geoff with four.
[36:10.670 --> 36:12.190]  Geoff with four going once.
[36:12.330 --> 36:13.930]  It's got that nostalgia factor.
[36:14.630 --> 36:17.070]  It does. Geoff with four going twice.
[36:17.630 --> 36:17.950]  Five.
[36:19.950 --> 36:22.290]  Six. Six.
[36:22.710 --> 36:23.750]  Oh, seven.
[36:24.550 --> 36:24.890]  OK.
[36:27.230 --> 36:28.470]  This might make some money.
[36:28.750 --> 36:33.590]  Like this really this has everyone like this has the human capybara guy in it.
[36:33.830 --> 36:35.290]  Yeah. And that's the sequel.
[36:35.530 --> 36:36.690]  And it's happening at a time
[36:36.690 --> 36:40.490]  when climate is a big issue to let me look up the release date,
[36:40.670 --> 36:42.010]  because I bet it's July 4th weekend.
[36:42.470 --> 36:44.350]  Oh, fuck me if it is.
[36:44.830 --> 36:46.230]  July 19th. It's close.
[36:46.530 --> 36:47.230]  July 19th.
[36:47.290 --> 36:48.330]  Hmm. Hmm.
[36:49.090 --> 36:49.510]  Seven.
[36:50.070 --> 36:51.090]  Hold my seven.
[36:52.410 --> 36:53.210]  Seven going one.
[36:55.190 --> 36:55.830]  Seven going two.
[36:56.230 --> 36:56.610]  Eight.
[36:57.470 --> 36:58.270]  Oh, fuck you.
[37:00.130 --> 37:00.690]  Nine.
[37:01.290 --> 37:02.470]  Oh, there you go.
[37:04.010 --> 37:05.030]  Nine going one.
[37:06.690 --> 37:07.430]  Nine going twice.
[37:09.110 --> 37:10.710]  Oh, what was that?
[37:10.890 --> 37:11.690]  Did he say that?
[37:12.110 --> 37:13.050]  Did he say that?
[37:13.470 --> 37:14.710]  I just made a noise.
[37:15.110 --> 37:15.670]  Oh, OK.
[37:16.110 --> 37:18.310]  Sold to me at nine.
[37:19.030 --> 37:19.230]  Got it.
[37:20.170 --> 37:21.190]  Oh, it went.
[37:21.710 --> 37:24.330]  Oh, I couldn't tell if like that was the back end of a ten.
[37:25.550 --> 37:29.250]  Oh, next film, Deadpool and Wolverine.
[37:30.030 --> 37:30.410]  Forty one.
[37:31.850 --> 37:32.610]  Forty two.
[37:32.990 --> 37:34.010]  Oh, shit.
[37:37.940 --> 37:39.300]  Forty two going once.
[37:39.500 --> 37:41.740]  It's going to save the MCU and 43.
[37:42.180 --> 37:43.480]  Yeah. Forty five.
[37:44.560 --> 37:45.300]  Forty eight.
[37:46.240 --> 37:46.740]  Fifty.
[37:47.140 --> 37:47.840]  Sixty seven.
[37:48.560 --> 37:49.400]  Sixty eight.
[37:49.780 --> 37:51.640]  Oh, he's out.
[37:52.740 --> 37:54.300]  A great movie, my opinion.
[37:54.900 --> 37:56.780]  Yeah, I mean, that it had to be.
[37:58.520 --> 38:01.360]  It's going to get into a situation where there are too many points left.
[38:01.480 --> 38:02.460]  Yeah, you like you have to.
[38:02.880 --> 38:03.940]  I was waiting.
[38:03.940 --> 38:07.340]  I needed you guys to push him more on twisters,
[38:07.520 --> 38:09.260]  but I knew he wasn't going to go higher.
[38:09.680 --> 38:10.320]  No, exactly.
[38:10.320 --> 38:14.740]  I was like, I knew he wanted no shit because we knew you wanted Deadpool
[38:14.740 --> 38:18.660]  and Wolverine because you had to stay one point higher than me in order to do it.
[38:18.720 --> 38:21.220]  Yeah, most clearly, most obvious thing ever.
[38:21.660 --> 38:22.120]  Clearly.
[38:23.060 --> 38:23.740]  What is Didi?
[38:24.500 --> 38:27.320]  Didi is a movie that takes place in 2008.
[38:27.440 --> 38:29.980]  I watched a trailer for it this morning about a boy,
[38:31.020 --> 38:35.960]  Asian-American boy who isn't really sure who he is as a teenager in like 2008.
[38:36.080 --> 38:37.900]  So he starts. It's like, what was that movie?
[38:38.020 --> 38:39.500]  Mid-90s. It kind of looks like that.
[38:39.780 --> 38:40.620]  But sure. 2008.
[38:41.060 --> 38:41.460]  One.
[38:42.320 --> 38:42.740]  Or two.
[38:45.740 --> 38:46.660]  Two going once.
[38:48.260 --> 38:49.280]  Two going twice.
[38:50.280 --> 38:51.220]  Sold to Eric with two.
[38:51.760 --> 38:51.940]  Yep.
[38:54.660 --> 38:56.140]  I'm going to get some...
[38:56.140 --> 38:57.980]  I'm going to get stuck with some dregs here.
[38:59.740 --> 39:01.500]  So next up, we got Fabulous Four.
[39:01.500 --> 39:03.420]  There wasn't a box office mojo page for it.
[39:03.720 --> 39:05.260]  It is a Bette Midler film.
[39:05.780 --> 39:10.920]  The Fabulous Four is an upcoming American comedy film directed by Jocelyn Morehouse
[39:10.920 --> 39:12.880]  and written by Anne-Marie Allison.
[39:13.500 --> 39:19.440]  Stars Susan Sarandon, Bette Midler, Megan Mullally, and Cheryl Lee Ralph.
[39:20.080 --> 39:20.240]  Huh.
[39:22.300 --> 39:22.920]  Two.
[39:24.480 --> 39:25.580]  Geoff leading with two.
[39:26.620 --> 39:27.980]  Anyone else want to get in on it?
[39:30.000 --> 39:30.320]  Uh...
[39:30.840 --> 39:31.160]  Boy.
[39:32.080 --> 39:32.360]  No.
[39:32.520 --> 39:33.000]  Two going once.
[39:33.720 --> 39:34.120]  I'll take it.
[39:34.120 --> 39:34.640]  Two going twice.
[39:35.500 --> 39:37.300]  It could be the next First Wife Club.
[39:37.420 --> 39:37.620]  Could be.
[39:37.660 --> 39:38.760]  Could be the next Banger Sisters.
[39:39.360 --> 39:39.420]  Yep.
[39:39.900 --> 39:41.020]  I feel like you could have got that for one.
[39:41.540 --> 39:43.460]  Why did you add a one there and then a two?
[39:45.000 --> 39:45.720]  To fuck you?
[39:46.120 --> 39:46.580]  Is it working?
[39:46.680 --> 39:46.880]  What?
[39:47.360 --> 39:47.560]  What?
[39:47.560 --> 39:48.540]  I didn't already have a one.
[39:48.640 --> 39:49.540]  I didn't have a one for...
[39:49.540 --> 39:49.820]  Did I?
[39:50.260 --> 39:51.600]  Oh, that's my new line horror movie.
[39:51.700 --> 39:51.820]  Sorry.
[39:51.980 --> 39:52.120]  Sorry.
[39:52.260 --> 39:52.960]  Oh, why are you going?
[39:53.580 --> 39:54.220]  Jesus Christ.
[39:54.220 --> 39:55.420]  Why are you going?
[39:55.420 --> 39:55.680]  Yeah.
[39:55.860 --> 39:56.500]  Keep hitting test.
[39:56.700 --> 39:57.560]  Trying to...
[39:57.560 --> 39:59.400]  Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[39:59.600 --> 39:59.760]  One!
[40:04.100 --> 40:05.100]  Eric with one.
[40:05.640 --> 40:05.980]  One!
[40:06.600 --> 40:08.260]  No one else that did this Purple Crayon?
[40:09.340 --> 40:10.800]  I don't know what the fuck it is.
[40:10.900 --> 40:11.180]  Can we see the picture?
[40:11.180 --> 40:11.820]  Are you serious?
[40:12.900 --> 40:13.520]  Can we see the picture?
[40:13.520 --> 40:16.100]  It's a famous kid's book that is being turned into a movie.
[40:17.160 --> 40:17.560]  Never...
[40:17.560 --> 40:18.820]  I never read it to my kid.
[40:19.260 --> 40:19.600]  I don't know.
[40:20.840 --> 40:21.460]  Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[40:22.080 --> 40:23.040]  Trying to see if it'll...
[40:23.040 --> 40:23.300]  What?
[40:23.820 --> 40:24.120]  Come on.
[40:25.220 --> 40:25.720]  Two.
[40:25.900 --> 40:26.900]  I just want to give you a poster for it.
[40:27.480 --> 40:28.100]  Geoff with two.
[40:28.100 --> 40:28.300]  No, it doesn't.
[40:31.820 --> 40:32.720]  Alright, hang on.
[40:32.800 --> 40:33.420]  Andrew, don't...
[40:33.420 --> 40:35.280]  Don't start moving on it yet.
[40:35.340 --> 40:36.400]  I have to think this through.
[40:36.880 --> 40:37.420]  No, it's...
[40:37.420 --> 40:49.120]  Are enough people going to go, why the fuck did they make this to be worth three points?
[40:50.480 --> 40:51.440]  It is...
[40:51.440 --> 40:52.500]  It's so...
[40:53.920 --> 40:54.700]  Bizarre.
[40:55.510 --> 40:57.400]  Why did they do this?
[40:58.680 --> 41:00.340]  Starz Zachary Levi.
[41:01.120 --> 41:02.500]  Oh, yes it does.
[41:02.700 --> 41:03.180]  Alfred Molina.
[41:03.560 --> 41:04.260]  Zooey Deschanel.
[41:04.840 --> 41:05.040]  Yeah.
[41:05.180 --> 41:05.480]  Glenn Clement.
[41:07.660 --> 41:09.220]  It is...
[41:09.630 --> 41:10.020]  Three.
[41:11.900 --> 41:15.160]  I think it's so bizarre I have to go three.
[41:16.780 --> 41:18.500]  Three going twice.
[41:20.780 --> 41:21.860]  Man, I got...
[41:21.860 --> 41:22.580]  Dickle movies.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  To Eric with three.
[41:28.640 --> 41:29.740]  Next film.
[41:30.220 --> 41:33.920]  Another movie that we pitched something for that will not happen.
[41:34.660 --> 41:36.300]  Borderlands the movie.
[41:39.680 --> 41:40.980]  Like from the game?
[41:41.400 --> 41:41.840]  Yes.
[41:42.060 --> 41:42.340]  Yeah.
[41:42.480 --> 41:42.800]  Yes.
[41:43.480 --> 41:44.900]  Directed by Eli Roth.
[41:45.560 --> 41:46.540]  Starring Kevin Hart.
[41:47.160 --> 41:48.020]  Jamie Lee Curtis.
[41:49.620 --> 41:50.740]  Kate Blanchett.
[41:51.020 --> 41:51.580]  Kate Blanchett.
[41:51.680 --> 41:51.960]  That's right.
[41:52.040 --> 41:52.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[41:52.760 --> 41:53.740]  It's her birthday today.
[41:54.220 --> 41:55.100]  Geoff, you're going four?
[41:55.620 --> 41:56.260]  Yeah, I'll go four.
[41:56.340 --> 41:57.340]  Bobby Lee's in it too, I think.
[41:57.520 --> 41:57.920]  I'll do five.
[41:58.020 --> 41:58.200]  Yep.
[41:59.380 --> 41:59.980]  Eric with five.
[42:01.120 --> 42:01.440]  Six.
[42:02.740 --> 42:03.680]  Geoff with six.
[42:05.260 --> 42:06.020]  Eric with eight.
[42:06.940 --> 42:07.940]  I'll go ten.
[42:09.260 --> 42:09.580]  Ooh.
[42:10.740 --> 42:11.700]  You got 11 in you, Eric?
[42:12.140 --> 42:13.400]  Let me look at the rest of this list.
[42:13.980 --> 42:16.480]  I was gonna say, you guys are gonna have to start spending money on something.
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.880]  You do not take your points with you.
[42:19.380 --> 42:21.240]  Can I just add it to my box office total?
[42:22.960 --> 42:23.520]  What?
[42:24.240 --> 42:26.260]  You wanna add 41 to your box office total?
[42:27.160 --> 42:30.200]  It'll be like $33 million in 41 dollars.
[42:30.840 --> 42:33.620]  Yeah, you know what?
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.960]  I think if you have any points left over, you can add them to your box office total.
[42:39.680 --> 42:41.460]  Geoff, you're at ten?
[42:42.220 --> 42:42.680]  Yeah.
[42:44.660 --> 42:45.620]  I'll do 11.
[42:46.380 --> 42:47.320]  Eric with 11.
[42:48.760 --> 42:49.800]  Is that enough?
[42:50.640 --> 42:51.780]  11 going once?
[42:52.600 --> 42:53.640]  11 going twice?
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.020]  Sold to Eric at 11.
[42:58.660 --> 43:02.040]  I don't feel good about that, but I feel good enough about it.
[43:02.280 --> 43:03.660]  You have seven movies.
[43:04.280 --> 43:04.460]  Yeah.
[43:05.540 --> 43:06.380]  Racking it up.
[43:06.760 --> 43:08.200]  What is It Ends With Us?
[43:09.180 --> 43:10.600]  It Ends With Us.
[43:10.780 --> 43:12.400]  I feel like I've read that. Is it a book?
[43:13.040 --> 43:14.000]  What is It Ends With Us?
[43:14.000 --> 43:14.960]  It does sound familiar.
[43:15.960 --> 43:17.280]  It Ends With Us is a book.
[43:17.280 --> 43:27.860]  And it is also a movie starring Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni, Brandon Sklonar, Jenny Slate.
[43:28.260 --> 43:28.620]  Interesting.
[43:29.140 --> 43:30.600]  Geoff loves Jenny Slate.
[43:31.000 --> 43:31.780]  Yeah, Jenny Slate's great.
[43:33.100 --> 43:34.860]  You have one dream about a lady.
[43:36.720 --> 43:42.520]  Complications arise when a woman's high school love interest comes back into her life.
[43:45.950 --> 43:47.150]  Blake Lively.
[43:48.070 --> 43:49.410]  Geoff with one.
[43:51.230 --> 43:52.230]  One going one.
[43:52.470 --> 43:52.850]  Two.
[43:53.670 --> 43:54.150]  Three.
[43:56.690 --> 43:58.070]  Gavin, you gotta get in here, man.
[43:58.890 --> 43:59.130]  Nah.
[43:59.910 --> 44:01.170]  Three going twice.
[44:02.550 --> 44:04.310]  Sold to Geoff at three.
[44:04.950 --> 44:07.390]  Now, here's the thing. That might be a good one for...
[44:08.190 --> 44:08.770]  Could be huge.
[44:09.470 --> 44:15.390]  I mean, I don't think it's gonna be gigantic, but I do think that based on book type situation...
[44:15.390 --> 44:17.650]  It's probably a $150 million movie.
[44:19.970 --> 44:21.250]  Next up.
[44:22.470 --> 44:22.950]  Cuckoo.
[44:23.750 --> 44:25.170]  I believe it's another horror film.
[44:25.990 --> 44:31.970]  17-year-old Gretchen reluctantly leaves America to live with her father at a resort in the German Alps.
[44:32.330 --> 44:38.990]  Plagued by strange noises and bloody visions, she soon discovers a shocking secret that concerns her own family.
[44:39.570 --> 44:40.410]  Oh, God.
[44:41.830 --> 44:43.550]  I like the way Andrew said it.
[44:43.810 --> 44:44.470]  Anyone wanna bid?
[44:44.470 --> 44:45.190]  One.
[44:47.430 --> 44:48.510]  Geoff with one.
[44:49.330 --> 44:50.970]  Think I might let him have it.
[44:52.070 --> 44:53.410]  Geoff with one going once.
[44:53.970 --> 44:54.410]  Two.
[44:55.330 --> 44:55.890]  Wow.
[44:56.990 --> 44:58.790]  Gavin with two going once.
[45:00.550 --> 45:01.150]  Twice.
[45:01.510 --> 45:02.870]  I just want some bargains, you know?
[45:02.930 --> 45:04.490]  Oh, my God.
[45:04.690 --> 45:05.470]  It's not a bargain anymore.
[45:06.130 --> 45:09.390]  I think four is still a bargain for Cuckoo.
[45:11.270 --> 45:12.930]  Or Cuckoo, as Andrew says.
[45:15.870 --> 45:16.850]  Going twice.
[45:18.010 --> 45:18.530]  Cuckoo.
[45:20.130 --> 45:20.650]  Sold.
[45:21.210 --> 45:22.050]  To Geoff.
[45:22.610 --> 45:25.950]  I think that's gonna be like a midsomer type thing.
[45:27.710 --> 45:29.370]  Yeah, I doubt it, but yeah, maybe.
[45:29.710 --> 45:30.230]  Never know.
[45:31.710 --> 45:33.230]  Will or won't.
[45:34.550 --> 45:38.210]  Next film, The Fire Inside doesn't have a box office mojo page.
[45:38.630 --> 45:39.750]  Or else we'd have one.
[45:40.450 --> 45:42.470]  I don't really know what this is, to be completely honest.
[45:42.470 --> 45:51.410]  The story of Clarissa T. Rex Shields, a boxer from Flint, Michigan,
[45:51.770 --> 45:55.870]  who trained to become the first woman in her country's history
[45:55.870 --> 45:58.450]  to win an Olympic gold medal in the sport.
[45:58.870 --> 46:01.770]  I saw a trailer for this movie, and it looked good.
[46:01.950 --> 46:02.930]  I will bet one for it.
[46:03.470 --> 46:04.250]  I already said one.
[46:04.650 --> 46:05.110]  Oh, two.
[46:06.450 --> 46:07.130]  Geoff with two.
[46:08.590 --> 46:09.330]  Going once.
[46:09.430 --> 46:10.050]  Where am I at?
[46:11.170 --> 46:12.170]  Going twice.
[46:13.250 --> 46:14.250]  Sold to Geoff.
[46:14.890 --> 46:15.390]  Add two.
[46:15.870 --> 46:16.150]  Yeehaw.
[46:18.030 --> 46:19.070]  I think I played this wrong.
[46:19.570 --> 46:21.350]  I played this super wrong.
[46:25.970 --> 46:26.530]  Trap.
[46:27.390 --> 46:29.650]  It is an M. Night Shyamalan movie.
[46:30.170 --> 46:30.410]  One.
[46:30.650 --> 46:31.270]  Josh Hartnett.
[46:32.530 --> 46:32.870]  One.
[46:33.410 --> 46:34.570]  I'll say three.
[46:36.330 --> 46:37.110]  Oh, Eric with three.
[46:38.710 --> 46:39.490]  Three going one.
[46:41.090 --> 46:41.750]  That's a good deal.
[46:41.750 --> 46:42.490]  Three going twice.
[46:44.130 --> 46:45.650]  Sold to Eric at three.
[46:45.750 --> 46:46.750]  I think that's a hell of a buy.
[46:46.750 --> 46:49.330]  That is going to be a sleeper hit.
[46:49.650 --> 46:51.450]  I think it's going to have momentum.
[46:52.050 --> 46:55.510]  The trailer looked, I thought, really good.
[46:55.890 --> 46:57.270]  I was very impressed.
[46:57.490 --> 47:00.250]  And I don't like his movies almost at all.
[47:00.630 --> 47:02.170]  I thought this trailer looked really interesting.
[47:02.630 --> 47:04.210]  Did you see that movie, The Visit, he did?
[47:04.910 --> 47:05.630]  Uh, no.
[47:06.010 --> 47:08.390]  That is a fucking awesome movie.
[47:08.390 --> 47:09.190]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[47:09.310 --> 47:16.150]  Like, when he has no budget, I have this theory about this guy where he has no budget and he makes movies scrappy with people that don't know how to make movies.
[47:16.530 --> 47:17.510]  Like, where they're like learning.
[47:17.750 --> 47:19.330]  He fucking knocks it out of the park.
[47:19.470 --> 47:24.910]  But he keeps getting in this cycle where he does that and then he gets too big and makes too much money.
[47:25.050 --> 47:25.930]  He flies too close to the sun.
[47:26.010 --> 47:27.030]  He makes dog shit.
[47:27.350 --> 47:29.650]  And then he has to start all over from square one.
[47:30.170 --> 47:32.150]  You give him too much money and he doesn't know what to do with it.
[47:32.290 --> 47:32.850]  Yep, yep.
[47:32.990 --> 47:33.950]  And so he makes banger movies.
[47:34.050 --> 47:37.070]  And I think this, this is going to be his sweet spot.
[47:37.070 --> 47:38.450]  I feel good about this one.
[47:38.530 --> 47:38.910]  Alright.
[47:40.470 --> 47:41.590]  Alien Romulus.
[47:41.930 --> 47:42.230]  One.
[47:43.150 --> 47:46.230]  Unbelievably, they are making another Alien movie.
[47:46.710 --> 47:48.810]  Is this Ridley Scott or someone else?
[47:48.810 --> 47:48.910]  No.
[47:49.550 --> 47:52.030]  He's just walked away from his new trilogy, has he?
[47:52.330 --> 47:53.950]  Yeah, I believe so.
[47:54.490 --> 48:03.690]  It's a new entry in the Alien franchise that still doesn't explain, I feel like, the space jockey thing that they've tried to explain for like the last six movies.
[48:04.570 --> 48:06.270]  This is the seventh installment.
[48:06.270 --> 48:06.970]  Aliens.
[48:07.770 --> 48:09.150]  Yeah, seventh installment.
[48:09.650 --> 48:10.850]  Gavin said one, I'll say two.
[48:12.710 --> 48:13.710]  Two going one.
[48:14.650 --> 48:15.190]  Three.
[48:16.690 --> 48:17.790]  Three going one.
[48:20.050 --> 48:20.690]  Four.
[48:22.210 --> 48:23.370]  Four going one.
[48:23.910 --> 48:24.630]  Five going one.
[48:25.130 --> 48:26.070]  Oh shit, now we're going.
[48:26.350 --> 48:27.490]  Six going one.
[48:27.890 --> 48:28.390]  Popping off.
[48:30.170 --> 48:31.250]  Six going twice.
[48:31.690 --> 48:33.050]  Seven going one.
[48:33.450 --> 48:34.210]  Eight going once.
[48:35.050 --> 48:35.610]  Eleven.
[48:37.710 --> 48:38.970]  Eleven going once.
[48:39.470 --> 48:41.710]  Hang on, hang on.
[48:42.450 --> 48:43.690]  Let me look at this list.
[48:44.270 --> 48:45.290]  Eleven going twice.
[48:46.830 --> 48:47.390]  Twelve.
[48:49.410 --> 48:50.490]  Twelve going one.
[48:52.150 --> 48:52.710]  Thirteen.
[48:54.510 --> 48:55.470]  You know what?
[48:56.270 --> 48:57.090]  All yours.
[48:58.290 --> 49:01.030]  Sold to Gavin, unless Geoff, do you want to step in?
[49:01.250 --> 49:02.230]  No, I'm good, man.
[49:03.890 --> 49:06.630]  Sold to Gavin at thirteen.
[49:08.530 --> 49:10.790]  It's tough because I want to say it will make money.
[49:10.970 --> 49:12.570]  I don't have confidence that it will make money.
[49:12.810 --> 49:13.750]  Yeah, I hope it's good.
[49:14.290 --> 49:17.010]  I mean, Alien at the front carries some weight.
[49:17.150 --> 49:19.910]  It probably carries a hundred million dollars worth of weight.
[49:20.330 --> 49:24.050]  I think that Alien at the front carries about seven points worth of weight.
[49:24.350 --> 49:27.170]  But when you get up to about thirteen, I don't know that it carries thirteen points.
[49:27.250 --> 49:28.730]  But we are pretty far down the list, so we'll see.
[49:28.870 --> 49:29.770]  We are, we're almost done.
[49:29.770 --> 49:35.550]  Horizon and American Saga chapter two, the continuation of Kevin Costner's film.
[49:35.990 --> 49:37.530]  It's also coming out in the summer?
[49:38.290 --> 49:39.010]  It is, yeah.
[49:39.330 --> 49:40.810]  I think it comes out in like August.
[49:41.310 --> 49:43.150]  It is, it is a mid-August release.
[49:44.890 --> 49:46.610]  Is Geoff going to get it?
[49:46.770 --> 49:48.650]  I'll bid one on it.
[49:49.050 --> 49:49.350]  Two.
[49:50.510 --> 49:51.050]  Three.
[49:53.050 --> 49:54.010]  Three going one.
[49:54.710 --> 49:55.110]  Four.
[49:55.790 --> 49:56.330]  Five.
[49:58.350 --> 49:59.350]  Five going one.
[50:01.410 --> 50:02.610]  Five going twice.
[50:02.990 --> 50:03.510]  Six.
[50:07.100 --> 50:08.320]  Six going once.
[50:10.160 --> 50:11.440]  Six going twice.
[50:13.920 --> 50:15.420]  Sold to Gavin at six.
[50:15.860 --> 50:19.020]  Geoff, did you make twenty points on the first one?
[50:19.020 --> 50:20.800]  I've already invested my money in that movie.
[50:22.460 --> 50:25.540]  Here's the thing. Part one might make some money.
[50:25.780 --> 50:28.920]  I will say no fucking shot part two makes anything.
[50:29.080 --> 50:30.780]  What if part two is like the two towers?
[50:31.620 --> 50:32.640]  It could be huge.
[50:32.640 --> 50:35.300]  What? Oh, the movie.
[50:38.520 --> 50:41.240]  What are you talking about, bud?
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.900]  You went to a dark spot, Eric. Jesus Christ.
[50:44.200 --> 50:45.440]  God damn, I didn't understand.
[50:46.040 --> 50:47.320]  That's my cheapest purchase.
[50:48.640 --> 50:51.020]  What is Ryan's World the movie?
[50:51.540 --> 50:55.520]  Ryan is a YouTube kid, I think, that does toy stuff.
[50:55.820 --> 50:57.860]  And this is his movie?
[50:59.080 --> 50:59.320]  Two.
[51:00.940 --> 51:03.300]  Geoff Ryan toys review guy?
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.780]  Ryan's toy review guy has a movie called Ryan's World the movie.
[51:07.960 --> 51:08.940]  Geoff, we met him.
[51:09.820 --> 51:10.200]  Did we?
[51:10.560 --> 51:14.180]  Well, we didn't meet Ryan, but we met the guy that runs the channel.
[51:14.860 --> 51:16.360]  Did we? When did we do that?
[51:18.060 --> 51:18.500]  Did we really?
[51:18.760 --> 51:19.360]  Yeah, in New York.
[51:20.160 --> 51:22.740]  Oh, okay. Did we like him?
[51:24.060 --> 51:25.680]  I mean, I liked him. He's very...
[51:25.680 --> 51:26.260]  Why are we...
[51:27.080 --> 51:28.940]  You brought this up, I don't know!
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.140]  I don't want to derail the middle of the auction.
[51:31.400 --> 51:33.720]  No, it's fine. Two. Geoff with two.
[51:34.080 --> 51:34.400]  Three.
[51:35.340 --> 51:36.600]  Gavin with three.
[51:36.980 --> 51:37.840]  Four. Wow.
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.020]  Apparently I'm close friends with the guy who made it.
[51:40.360 --> 51:41.540]  Five. Six.
[51:42.940 --> 51:47.920]  Geoff believes in this more than he believes in Horizon and American Sega Chapter 2.
[51:48.180 --> 51:49.400]  Geoff with six.
[51:51.940 --> 51:53.320]  Geoff with six going once.
[51:54.580 --> 51:55.100]  Twice.
[51:56.440 --> 51:57.000]  Sold.
[51:57.000 --> 52:02.040]  I cannot believe that Ryan's world, the movie, went for six points.
[52:02.520 --> 52:04.140]  Did it get higher or lower?
[52:04.840 --> 52:06.240]  Much lower, in my opinion.
[52:06.400 --> 52:10.640]  That was the number one YouTube channel in the world for like five years.
[52:11.160 --> 52:15.060]  But once again, when the iron was hot, how did Rooster Teeth do?
[52:17.900 --> 52:21.000]  Rooster Teeth was never the number one anything in the world ever.
[52:23.680 --> 52:25.700]  Next film is Blink Twice.
[52:25.700 --> 52:28.840]  This is a Channing Tatum horror film.
[52:29.340 --> 52:31.880]  When tech billionaire Slater King meets Frida,
[52:32.060 --> 52:36.680]  he invites her to join him and his friends for a dream vacation on his private island.
[52:36.900 --> 52:40.580]  However, as strange things start to happen,
[52:41.040 --> 52:44.740]  she'll have to uncover the truth if she wants to make it out alive.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.440]  Director Zoe Kravitz.
[52:47.680 --> 52:49.200]  Oh, yeah.
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.720]  My favorite thing in the world to do is to,
[52:52.820 --> 52:55.080]  whenever there's a capital L and an I together,
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.360]  pronounce it as a U.
[52:56.740 --> 52:58.540]  So I'm going to put one on bunk twice.
[52:58.940 --> 52:59.900]  Bunk twice?
[53:00.360 --> 53:02.660]  I'll bid two on bunk twice.
[53:03.880 --> 53:04.480]  Three.
[53:05.760 --> 53:06.520]  Love is bund.
[53:08.020 --> 53:08.620]  Geoff with four.
[53:11.260 --> 53:12.860]  Geoff with four going once.
[53:14.020 --> 53:16.140]  Geoff with four going twice.
[53:17.620 --> 53:18.820]  Sold to Geoff.
[53:19.540 --> 53:21.640]  Island movies are hot right now.
[53:22.280 --> 53:24.460]  What are you talking about?
[53:25.080 --> 53:26.320]  Triangle of Sadness?
[53:26.820 --> 53:27.380]  Island movie.
[53:27.660 --> 53:30.780]  That movie where they all go and they eat at the restaurant
[53:30.780 --> 53:31.860]  and then they get stuck there?
[53:32.180 --> 53:32.980]  Restaurant movie.
[53:33.500 --> 53:35.900]  The other one, The Glass Onion?
[53:36.580 --> 53:37.480]  Island movie.
[53:38.040 --> 53:39.280]  Island, island, island.
[53:39.400 --> 53:41.380]  Every year there's a hot island movie right now.
[53:41.860 --> 53:45.540]  Could have gone with rich people being killed off
[53:45.540 --> 53:47.220]  as the common denominator there,
[53:47.300 --> 53:49.120]  but went with on an island.
[53:49.760 --> 53:51.240]  Yeah, all the people were on an island.
[53:52.260 --> 53:53.340]  It depends, doesn't it?
[53:53.900 --> 53:55.520]  Yeah, it does.
[53:56.920 --> 53:57.660]  Nature's pen.
[53:57.980 --> 54:00.120]  Just as we're getting to the bottom, points wise,
[54:00.440 --> 54:02.920]  I have 48, Gavin has 40, Geoff has 22.
[54:03.880 --> 54:04.720]  No, Gavin has 22, Geoff has three.
[54:04.720 --> 54:07.460]  Nick and I have been out of this draft for what feels like a day.
[54:09.140 --> 54:12.960]  Next film, speaking about films striking when the iron is hot,
[54:13.520 --> 54:14.040]  The Crow.
[54:17.460 --> 54:17.980]  Three.
[54:18.460 --> 54:20.960]  Is this a remake or a sequel or what?
[54:21.460 --> 54:24.040]  I think it's a remake with Bill Skarsgård.
[54:24.240 --> 54:24.600]  Yeah.
[54:25.260 --> 54:27.740]  I bet the armor is going to be extra careful on that.
[54:28.860 --> 54:29.620]  You'd hope so.
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.200]  Yeah, one would assume.
[54:32.740 --> 54:34.540]  So, sorry, who is top in with three?
[54:34.680 --> 54:35.640]  Me, three, three.
[54:35.780 --> 54:36.620]  Eric with three.
[54:37.020 --> 54:37.380]  Four.
[54:38.240 --> 54:38.600]  Five.
[54:38.700 --> 54:39.240]  Gavin with four.
[54:39.460 --> 54:39.820]  Five.
[54:41.180 --> 54:41.540]  Six.
[54:42.660 --> 54:44.440]  We got a Ryan's World the movie on our hands.
[54:44.440 --> 54:45.900]  Oh, even better than Ryan's World.
[54:46.060 --> 54:46.660]  Eric with seven.
[54:48.840 --> 54:49.320]  Eight.
[54:49.500 --> 54:49.880]  Seven going one.
[54:50.340 --> 54:50.720]  Nine.
[54:50.940 --> 54:51.180]  Eight.
[54:51.800 --> 54:52.240]  Nine.
[54:52.680 --> 54:53.240]  Nine going one.
[54:53.600 --> 54:56.140]  It's not worth this, but I don't know what else to spend on.
[54:56.860 --> 54:58.100]  That's the problem when you wait.
[54:59.360 --> 54:59.840]  Eleven.
[54:59.960 --> 55:00.280]  Ten going one.
[55:00.520 --> 55:00.980]  Eleven.
[55:01.400 --> 55:01.680]  Twelve.
[55:02.560 --> 55:03.040]  Thirteen.
[55:04.680 --> 55:05.160]  Fourteen.
[55:05.400 --> 55:05.820]  Fifteen.
[55:06.680 --> 55:07.500]  Twenty-two.
[55:08.060 --> 55:08.520]  Twenty-three.
[55:09.400 --> 55:09.820]  Alright.
[55:10.920 --> 55:12.060]  Gavin is now out.
[55:12.060 --> 55:14.060]  Eric with twenty-three going once.
[55:14.840 --> 55:15.840]  Going twice.
[55:16.620 --> 55:18.620]  Sold to Eric for twenty-three points.
[55:18.860 --> 55:21.800]  Of this whole list, Eric spent the most on the crow.
[55:23.220 --> 55:26.880]  I think that, I think, I don't think it's gonna kill.
[55:27.220 --> 55:30.380]  I think there will be an audience for the crow.
[55:30.820 --> 55:35.080]  As weird as that sounds, the amount of time between the last one and this one,
[55:35.420 --> 55:41.840]  the weird goth resurgence thing, and like, to me, everything, it's prime to do well.
[55:42.060 --> 55:46.160]  I think, I think that this movie has enough time between the last, all this stuff.
[55:46.360 --> 55:48.260]  It has the clown guy from It.
[55:48.600 --> 55:51.340]  It's gonna be a weird Tumblr movie that does well.
[55:51.520 --> 55:52.440]  That's how it feels to me.
[55:52.480 --> 55:53.360]  I think you might be right.
[55:54.440 --> 56:00.480]  Like, the Gen Z is intrigued enough in the 90s already.
[56:00.860 --> 56:03.180]  I think that this might scratch an itch.
[56:03.200 --> 56:05.880]  I think that it will, the budget was only fifty million.
[56:06.120 --> 56:09.500]  I think it's gonna crush in the box office just because,
[56:09.500 --> 56:12.660]  oh wow, this was pretty good, and that's all it needs to be.
[56:12.920 --> 56:15.560]  It already has name recognition, but people don't know why.
[56:15.780 --> 56:16.720]  You know, they just know the name.
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.680]  Well, the next film does not have name recognition.
[56:22.040 --> 56:24.400]  It is another biblical movie, I believe.
[56:24.720 --> 56:25.940]  The Forge.
[56:26.780 --> 56:27.140]  One.
[56:29.320 --> 56:30.620]  One going once.
[56:32.080 --> 56:33.380]  One going twice.
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.420]  Hang on before you get there.
[56:35.420 --> 56:39.720]  Geoff, after graduating from high school without any plans for the future,
[56:40.040 --> 56:44.820]  Isaiah receives a push to start making better life decisions.
[56:45.680 --> 56:47.100]  Is that...
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.400]  Do anything for you?
[56:50.620 --> 56:51.380]  No.
[56:52.120 --> 56:54.140]  Sold to Gavin at one.
[56:54.460 --> 56:54.960]  Bargain.
[56:56.420 --> 56:58.960]  Now you're left with 21. Great number.
[56:58.960 --> 57:02.960]  Going into slingshot one.
[57:03.140 --> 57:05.720]  Does not have a box office mojo page.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.160]  Slingshot 2024.
[57:09.660 --> 57:12.860]  An astronaut struggles to maintain his grip on reality
[57:12.860 --> 57:15.320]  aboard a possibly fatal...
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.560]  a possibly fatally compromised mission to Saturn's moon, Titan.
[57:21.180 --> 57:25.500]  Lawrence Fishburne, Casey Affleck, David Morrissey.
[57:25.920 --> 57:26.180]  Wow.
[57:27.140 --> 57:27.820]  Interesting.
[57:28.520 --> 57:29.040]  One.
[57:30.020 --> 57:31.040]  I already said one.
[57:31.140 --> 57:31.720]  Gavin said one.
[57:31.820 --> 57:32.060]  Two.
[57:33.580 --> 57:34.100]  Three.
[57:34.280 --> 57:35.180]  Gavin does like space shit.
[57:36.920 --> 57:39.320]  Lawrence Fishburne in space is usually pretty gnarly, isn't he?
[57:39.320 --> 57:40.300]  Yeah, he does pretty well.
[57:41.680 --> 57:42.480]  Three going twice.
[57:44.000 --> 57:44.780]  Who's on three?
[57:45.540 --> 57:46.060]  You.
[57:46.500 --> 57:47.420]  Sold to you.
[57:48.460 --> 57:49.060]  At three.
[57:55.920 --> 57:59.880]  Once again, no box office mojo page for City of Dreams.
[57:59.880 --> 58:00.940]  One.
[58:01.840 --> 58:04.720]  Gavin with one, just blindly throwing one at it. Why not?
[58:04.940 --> 58:05.820]  Hang on, hang on.
[58:06.020 --> 58:06.900]  City of Dreams.
[58:08.420 --> 58:10.800]  Inspired by a true story,
[58:11.500 --> 58:14.600]  City of Dreams chronicles the journey of a Mexican boy
[58:14.600 --> 58:18.420]  whose dreams of becoming a soccer star are shattered
[58:18.420 --> 58:21.500]  when he's smuggled across the border and sold to a sweatshop
[58:21.500 --> 58:24.140]  in downtown Los Angeles.
[58:25.500 --> 58:26.420]  Sam Levine.
[58:28.180 --> 58:29.020]  Sam Levine?
[58:29.020 --> 58:29.680]  Sam Levine?
[58:30.060 --> 58:30.920]  Yep, I'll go two.
[58:31.640 --> 58:33.240]  We had him on a...
[58:33.240 --> 58:33.560]  Yes.
[58:33.940 --> 58:34.140]  Yeah.
[58:35.060 --> 58:35.500]  I'll say two.
[58:35.720 --> 58:36.500]  Eric with two going one.
[58:36.780 --> 58:40.080]  Sam Levine, that's the guy behind Ryan Toy Reviews, right?
[58:42.880 --> 58:43.640]  Yeah, he's the channel manager.
[58:43.660 --> 58:45.780]  Three going one for Gavin.
[58:46.920 --> 58:47.800]  Going twice.
[58:48.780 --> 58:49.600]  You got it, buddy.
[58:49.680 --> 58:50.460]  Sold to Gavin.
[58:50.740 --> 58:51.680]  Gavin on a run.
[58:52.200 --> 58:52.820]  I'm feeling this.
[58:52.820 --> 58:54.180]  I'm getting the dregs, boys.
[58:56.560 --> 58:58.220]  Put a lot of faith in Steve Carell.
[59:00.380 --> 59:02.440]  Next film is...
[59:03.520 --> 59:04.480]  Reagan.
[59:04.600 --> 59:06.200]  That fucking picture.
[59:07.660 --> 59:08.620]  Five.
[59:09.360 --> 59:10.100]  Film about Reagan.
[59:10.460 --> 59:12.840]  Eric with five going once.
[59:13.320 --> 59:14.120]  Six.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.100]  Six going one.
[59:19.060 --> 59:20.020]  Eight.
[59:23.180 --> 59:24.440]  Eight going once.
[59:25.280 --> 59:26.200]  Fifteen.
[59:26.260 --> 59:26.440]  Nine.
[59:26.880 --> 59:27.780]  What? Fifteen? Okay.
[59:28.340 --> 59:28.820]  Fifteen.
[59:28.820 --> 59:29.240]  Oh my god.
[59:29.640 --> 59:30.720]  What the fuck?
[59:31.800 --> 59:35.060]  Gavin doesn't want to take any dollars with him into the box office.
[59:36.460 --> 59:38.000]  Gavin, fifteen going once.
[59:38.440 --> 59:39.540]  I should have said fourteen.
[59:40.120 --> 59:40.600]  Twice.
[59:42.340 --> 59:42.820]  Sixteen.
[59:43.620 --> 59:44.100]  Oh!
[59:44.280 --> 59:45.700]  Eric swooping in with a sixteen.
[59:46.360 --> 59:46.840]  Wow.
[59:48.240 --> 59:50.060]  Geoff, do you want a counter or are you happy giving it to Eric?
[59:50.060 --> 59:50.660]  I do not.
[59:50.740 --> 59:51.520]  I do not want a counter.
[59:51.540 --> 59:54.280]  Eric gets it with sixteen points.
[59:56.540 --> 01:00:01.280]  If you knew at the beginning of this list that you'd be jumping sixteen on Reagan.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:01.960]  Reagan!
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.960]  What is They Listen?
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:05.780]  They Listen.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.360]  Oh, hang on. This is a different one.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.480]  Hang on. What the fuck?
[01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.960]  What is They Listen 2024? Hang on.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:11.680]  There we go.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.300]  They Listen.
[01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.180]  How is that?
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.440]  When you search for it, plot under wraps.
[01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:21.540]  Twenty.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:27.360]  They Listen is an upcoming Blumhouse horror movie written and directed by Chris Weitz?
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.700]  Geoff with twenty.
[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:30.820]  I'll bid twenty.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.540]  Geoff's buying up the last two.
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.880]  Nobody can bid beyond that.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.640]  Geoff didn't even need to bid that high, but Geoff is getting a twenty.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.380]  Doesn't matter.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.860]  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.860]  What is that about?
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.380]  What if Eric and I combine our chips?
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:48.180]  Oh, and we can do it. We can beat him out.
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.820]  That is not allowed.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.040]  What? Why?
[01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:56.340]  I'm going to bid sixteen on Beetlejuice.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.040]  What happened over here?
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.140]  There you go. Thank you.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.460]  Okay, you're bidding what?
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:00.980]  Geoff gets it.
[01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.300]  I'm going to bid sixteen on Beetlejuice.
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:03.700]  What the fuck?
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:08.160]  You guys don't have enough points to counter Geoff at sixteen, bringing him down to four points.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.140]  Well, don't worry. I get to add nine dollars to my total amount.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:14.900]  Wow, congratulations.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:18.240]  Reagan? I think Reagan's... Guys, politics are hot right now.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.100]  Reagan's going to fucking kill.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.580]  It is an election year. You have a great point.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.420]  It is going to be so interesting to see who wins this.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:31.240]  I can't wait to see the results. I will say I have done like ten plus of these.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:34.420]  I don't think I've ever ended one with people having points.
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:39.060]  So the fact that three of you are wrapping this up with points is insane.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.380]  The fact that Geoff held so many points right until the end, but also has so many movies, that's crazy.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:49.260]  I was trying to be conservative sort of like near the end because I wanted Beetlejuice.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.900]  And then I just, it was like, it got to the point where it's like, here's Reagan.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.400]  And it's like, Geoff is already going to have more than me, so I have to spend it on something.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.840]  The order of the movies makes such a difference. It's crazy.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:06.840]  Big time. And I mean, I think outside of randomizing, doing in release order, I think is such a good move for this.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.360]  Now, did anybody not get a movie they really secretly wanted or they were really into?
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.800]  I mean, I wanted Deadpool and Wolverine.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.640]  I wanted Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.400]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:19.880]  But I spent too much.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.880]  I wanted Borderlands pretty badly.
[01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:24.860]  Really?
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.940]  I wanted to save enough for Beetlejuice because I knew you guys would blow money.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:28.280]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:28.800]  I'd be able to get it.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:35.660]  I really wanted the M. Night movie, but I figured it would go for higher than it did because of how many points were still on the board.
[01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:39.180]  What a fucking steal. I think that's going to crush for me.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.480]  I think that's going to do so well for me.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.240]  I think Inside Out 2 is going to underperform.
[01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.640]  I could see that. It's been such a long time.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.060]  I think so. Despicable Me 4 will make more money. I think Nick will win with that movie alone.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.060]  Really?
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:03:01.080]  Yes, I do agree with that. I do think that combining so many of these other ones or whatever is really cool and we'll get really close.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:06.020]  I don't think it's going to touch... I just don't think anything's going to touch that.
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.420]  It's going to run away with this shit this year. It's going to be wild.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:14.200]  So I think it's sort of funny to look at, and I had a panic when I was looking at it.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.700]  People who own back-to-back films, it is very possible you're competing with yourself.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:23.900]  Like, I don't know that A Quiet Place Day 1 doesn't release the same day as Despicable Me 4.
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:27.720]  Even though they're different audiences, but Nick is against himself that weekend.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.440]  I thought I was potentially against myself with Twisters and Deadpool, but it's a weak difference between those two.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.600]  Oh shit, I'm against myself with 4G Slingshot.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.720]  That's a slingshot!
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:45.560]  You're going to wake up and say, fuck, the 4G is taking all my City of Dreams money.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:46.600]  This is bullshit.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:53.620]  This is a lot of fun, guys. I'm excited. I will post updates throughout the summer, and I'm sure we'll talk about it on the show and stuff.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.040]  Put it on the... we should make a... honestly, we should make it... put it on the Patreon, let people know, whatever.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.380]  Track it on the Discord. Have people keep track of it on our Discord.
[01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.380]  I think that's going to be just a shit-talking storm in there.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.420]  I'm really excited. And let us know in the comments who you guys think is going to win.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.000]  Based on these results and everything.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.660]  Maybe we'll put a poll or something in the Patreon post for who people are going to win.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.400]  It's crazy how much of a shit I now give about this.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.080]  Yeah.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:23.400]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.980]  I want to build a time machine just so I can skip this summer just to find out how it is.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.420]  This is awesome. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.540]  I'm excited to see who wins this.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.320]  Good luck, guys. Don't forget, there's something on the line.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:40.620]  Whoever wins gets to make a movie.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:45.020]  Next time we do this, can we all sit on chairs with a little stick with a number on it?
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.160]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I think we should.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:49.520]  Sounds like a plan.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:52.020]  Can I ask you guys right before we wrap up?
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.880]  If you had to pick a movie right now that we were going to watch, do you know what it would be?
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.720]  Right now, I would say Ongbak.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.480]  I've been in an Ongbak. I've wanted to revisit that for a while.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.680]  Can it be any movie in the world?
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:05.620]  Yeah, any movie in the world.
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.200]  Oh, jeez. I'd make us watch Super Fuzz.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.620]  Oh, yeah.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.240]  I've never heard of it. Excited.
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.040]  We'll see. We'll find out. We'll see as the summer unfolds.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.360]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.960]  Check out our Patreon if you haven't already.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:21.940]  We appreciate your support so much.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.400]  Have a great day.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.540]  Bye!
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.280]  Shit!
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.380]  Fifteen bucks left.
