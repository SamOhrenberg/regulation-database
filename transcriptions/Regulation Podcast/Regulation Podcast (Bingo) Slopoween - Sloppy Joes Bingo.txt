[00:00.000 --> 00:02.300]  Happy Halloween, everyone.
[00:02.980 --> 00:03.540]  Happy Halloween.
[00:04.000 --> 00:04.960]  Oh, I do see us.
[00:05.100 --> 00:06.700]  We are listed under special events.
[00:06.920 --> 00:07.800]  We are live.
[00:08.420 --> 00:09.180]  We are a special event.
[00:10.040 --> 00:11.420]  Link not working, apparently.
[00:11.520 --> 00:12.360]  What does that mean? What link?
[00:13.020 --> 00:13.400]  What link?
[00:14.740 --> 00:15.740]  Did we put a link?
[00:15.880 --> 00:17.200]  Oh, is it like the link to the cards?
[00:17.680 --> 00:17.880]  Maybe.
[00:19.160 --> 00:20.540]  Check. Check the link.
[00:21.260 --> 00:21.860]  Check the link.
[00:24.200 --> 00:26.740]  Gavin. Shut it down to check the link.
[00:26.820 --> 00:28.740]  Tapping into not knowing what's wrong,
[00:28.740 --> 00:32.340]  but calling out that something's wrong with no fix for the thing that's wrong.
[00:32.660 --> 00:35.340]  I can't think of something I despise more.
[00:35.780 --> 00:38.760]  I don't know what it is, I'm just letting you know that there's a problem.
[00:38.760 --> 00:40.140]  It makes me, like, violently upset.
[00:40.540 --> 00:41.280]  What link?
[00:41.700 --> 00:44.740]  But if it doesn't concern you, why even talk about it?
[00:44.760 --> 00:45.980]  Because you don't know what's happening.
[00:46.160 --> 00:49.920]  Someone on this Discord call, fool, knows what I'm talking about
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.600]  and has the ability to fix it before.
[00:52.100 --> 00:54.180]  Should we just ignore it for three hours?
[00:54.420 --> 00:57.380]  No, I don't think you have to ignore it for three hours.
[00:57.880 --> 00:58.740]  Two hours.
[00:59.140 --> 01:01.760]  I'm sure it's a reference to something in the Twitch thing.
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.180]  If there's an issue, we have mods that are wonderful and they will help.
[01:05.620 --> 01:07.240]  You just yelling, what's the link?
[01:08.080 --> 01:08.620]  I don't know.
[01:10.460 --> 01:11.500]  Andrew, I'm with you.
[01:11.740 --> 01:14.220]  Gavin, I appreciate the assistance.
[01:15.180 --> 01:16.240]  Yeah, you did great, Gavin.
[01:16.500 --> 01:18.920]  But yeah, also at the same time, tough.
[01:19.180 --> 01:21.360]  Hey, it's Scooby-Doo and Velma, the classic pair.
[01:21.800 --> 01:23.600]  Happy Halloween, everyone!
[01:23.840 --> 01:25.480]  You didn't, it's full screen, full screen.
[01:25.480 --> 01:27.940]  That is someone's dog costume.
[01:28.020 --> 01:29.220]  Oh, the guy dressed as a dog.
[01:29.340 --> 01:30.640]  I think that's one of our fucking...
[01:30.640 --> 01:32.800]  Yeah, but it's not what we're doing yet.
[01:32.860 --> 01:33.940]  It's not slop o'clock.
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.100]  We haven't started, guys.
[01:35.580 --> 01:39.640]  It's a Halloween deserted episode of Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:40.200 --> 01:43.920]  Welcome to the mean streets of Duval.
[01:44.840 --> 01:45.940]  No one's here.
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.180]  We don't know where they're at, but they'll start filing in soon.
[01:50.200 --> 01:51.860]  They were here an hour ago.
[01:51.860 --> 01:57.600]  Yeah, the sloppiness, I think, is only going to get more sloppy from here on out.
[01:57.680 --> 01:59.900]  Guys, what we're doing is a regular bingo card,
[02:00.680 --> 02:03.480]  which we are getting from regulationbingo.com
[02:04.600 --> 02:09.420]  and a special boo board that Andrew helped us put together.
[02:09.600 --> 02:12.700]  And we drafted on a Falcon event earlier this week
[02:13.600 --> 02:18.600]  with just Halloween related things to get on.
[02:19.200 --> 02:20.060]  Look at this.
[02:20.640 --> 02:21.900]  Look at this guy.
[02:22.540 --> 02:24.900]  Oh, is that guy supposed to be Dan?
[02:25.280 --> 02:27.560]  That guy's supposed to be dressed as Dan.
[02:27.880 --> 02:31.360]  Look at that. It's Dan from the slo-mo guys.
[02:34.360 --> 02:35.980]  Except that guy just pointed at the camera.
[02:36.160 --> 02:37.080]  Way better shape than the real Dan.
[02:37.100 --> 02:38.920]  Where's your peanut butter jar?
[02:39.740 --> 02:41.280]  I need you.
[02:41.900 --> 02:44.140]  It's the only chance I have.
[02:44.940 --> 02:47.280]  So the boo board is a mini board.
[02:47.280 --> 02:49.460]  It's only got nine options that we drafted.
[02:49.740 --> 02:52.280]  Like Eric said, if you want to see that draft, if you're a Falcon
[02:52.280 --> 02:54.760]  tier member over on the Patreon, you can you can go watch it.
[02:55.500 --> 02:56.920]  But do you want to run?
[02:56.980 --> 02:59.720]  Do you guys want to run down your nine?
[03:00.300 --> 03:01.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:01.240 --> 03:03.220]  We know what you got. Geoff, you want to go first?
[03:03.420 --> 03:04.140]  Yeah, I'll go first.
[03:04.260 --> 03:06.900]  Here are my nine group costumes.
[03:07.880 --> 03:11.200]  Costume collapse, aka somebody falls in costume.
[03:11.920 --> 03:14.040]  Body paint as a costume.
[03:14.690 --> 03:19.340]  I can't sit down because of an impractical or awkward costume.
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.260]  Regulation costume, aka tuxedo or snake eyes.
[03:23.480 --> 03:25.880]  We all also agree that snake eyes from G.I.
[03:25.920 --> 03:26.660]  Joe would count.
[03:27.580 --> 03:31.460]  Angel and devil both on the screen at the same time.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.280]  They don't have to be together.
[03:32.380 --> 03:34.800]  They just have to both be on camera at the same time.
[03:35.080 --> 03:36.560]  Spider-Man, skeet skeet.
[03:37.540 --> 03:41.060]  Dog wearing a costume, which I'm pretty sure we'll see.
[03:41.200 --> 03:42.580]  And then hot dog costume.
[03:42.580 --> 03:44.460]  Oh, those are good.
[03:44.480 --> 03:45.800]  Gavin, what are your nine?
[03:46.220 --> 03:50.200]  I have Halloween themed car, costumed background scooter.
[03:50.600 --> 03:52.680]  Wolverine, someone getting spooked.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.280]  Real life dead guy.
[03:54.980 --> 03:58.060]  Overdone costumes will require a majority agreement.
[03:58.640 --> 03:59.800]  Video game costume.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.220]  Monster mash.
[04:02.220 --> 04:04.220]  I think we have the Prince of Persia in front of us, possibly.
[04:04.600 --> 04:07.160]  And finally, Andrew's face.
[04:07.560 --> 04:09.460]  Yep. Which we would have had.
[04:10.020 --> 04:10.860]  Wait, what?
[04:11.060 --> 04:14.540]  He was wearing a sloppy Dre's bingo shirt, I guess.
[04:14.740 --> 04:14.920]  Yep.
[04:16.060 --> 04:17.400]  Andrew, what are your nine?
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.280]  I just want to pose first.
[04:19.380 --> 04:19.980]  I'm outraged.
[04:20.440 --> 04:22.240]  Fucking peanut butter jar is my center.
[04:22.740 --> 04:23.840]  I just generated.
[04:24.240 --> 04:25.720]  Mine are dude, where's my car?
[04:25.820 --> 04:26.540]  Witch without a broom.
[04:26.920 --> 04:28.400]  Gone fishing, fishnet clothing.
[04:28.820 --> 04:29.760]  Beetlejuice costume.
[04:30.260 --> 04:31.700]  Summer movie auction representative.
[04:32.220 --> 04:32.940]  Peanut butter jar.
[04:33.340 --> 04:34.200]  Doctor or nurse.
[04:34.560 --> 04:35.120]  Fake blood.
[04:35.520 --> 04:36.220]  Wrong holiday.
[04:36.740 --> 04:38.200]  Costumes of other holiday figures.
[04:38.200 --> 04:39.740]  And scream mask.
[04:40.280 --> 04:40.860]  Very nice.
[04:40.980 --> 04:42.220]  Nick, what are your nine?
[04:43.020 --> 04:45.580]  I've got Halloween themed car lights.
[04:45.800 --> 04:47.980]  Deadpool horror movie costume.
[04:48.380 --> 04:49.400]  That's Nick's kid.
[04:49.540 --> 04:51.980]  That's anyone dressed as Batman, although he's sick.
[04:52.220 --> 04:54.220]  Can it be anyone who's any vomit?
[04:54.460 --> 04:54.640]  Not air.
[04:54.940 --> 04:55.820]  Hey, look at this.
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.000]  Look at this right here.
[04:57.400 --> 04:58.200]  Hey, hey, hey.
[04:59.760 --> 05:01.040]  Thumbs up for YouTube, buddy.
[05:01.140 --> 05:01.700]  Happy Halloween.
[05:02.860 --> 05:05.440]  My anchor in the center is eating candy on camera.
[05:05.620 --> 05:06.780]  People in dog costume.
[05:07.230 --> 05:10.860]  They are not a kicker picker, which is any athlete's costume.
[05:10.900 --> 05:14.580]  Pumpkin themed outfit and baby in costume.
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.080]  Halloween themed car.
[05:17.200 --> 05:17.340]  Yep.
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.820]  There I think we're going to get a lot of these really fast.
[05:20.020 --> 05:20.660]  My nine.
[05:21.400 --> 05:23.780]  Two identical costumes in the same frame.
[05:24.460 --> 05:25.300]  Just ears.
[05:25.900 --> 05:27.780]  Cosplayer, which is a high quality costume.
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.520]  Halloween bouncer.
[05:30.300 --> 05:31.760]  Double fisting candy buckets.
[05:32.320 --> 05:33.080]  Penis costume.
[05:33.560 --> 05:35.860]  Party pooper, which is someone not dressed in costume.
[05:35.860 --> 05:36.940]  Who's that?
[05:37.320 --> 05:38.820]  Clearly a costume, but you can't tell what.
[05:39.320 --> 05:41.360]  And inflatable costume.
[05:42.180 --> 05:43.020]  Hey, it's ghosts.
[05:43.360 --> 05:45.040]  That's be careful on that.
[05:45.140 --> 05:47.420]  They take you somewhere that can kill you if you touch the silver.
[05:47.880 --> 05:48.800]  You are doomed.
[05:50.020 --> 05:55.300]  Well, also tonight we have a quick emergency scene that we have set up.
[05:55.360 --> 05:56.280]  Do you guys want to see those?
[05:56.300 --> 05:56.820]  Oh, look at that.
[05:57.520 --> 05:58.940]  Before they got big billboards.
[05:59.860 --> 05:59.960]  Wow.
[06:00.360 --> 06:01.280]  Yeah, look at that.
[06:01.700 --> 06:02.080]  Awesome.
[06:02.500 --> 06:03.840]  That's going to be a mortal.
[06:03.840 --> 06:06.680]  It's going to be immortalized.
[06:07.800 --> 06:09.340]  And we weren't even playing.
[06:11.100 --> 06:15.540]  Oh, no, that was such a Dan handshake.
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.060]  Why did I have that on my bingo card?
[06:22.440 --> 06:23.940]  Oh, my God.
[06:24.480 --> 06:25.560]  Oh, I'm going to throw up.
[06:26.120 --> 06:28.180]  That was the best start we've ever had.
[06:28.240 --> 06:29.060]  Oh, man.
[06:29.100 --> 06:30.560]  I can't wait for us to start.
[06:30.840 --> 06:33.240]  Somebody post that on the subreddit now.
[06:33.240 --> 06:34.600]  I'm going to watch that forever.
[06:35.060 --> 06:37.760]  Yeah, that just became our new intro.
[06:38.100 --> 06:38.780]  Oh, man.
[06:38.880 --> 06:40.160]  Hey, Nick is right.
[06:40.280 --> 06:44.180]  Just in case anything goes sideways on Duvall Street, we have to cut away.
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.360]  Nick, show them what they'll see if something bad happens.
[06:47.020 --> 06:48.600]  We got this bad boy right here.
[06:48.880 --> 06:51.040]  We got these two little puppy dogs.
[06:51.140 --> 06:52.100]  Cute, cute puppies.
[06:52.760 --> 06:53.500]  We got this.
[06:54.120 --> 06:54.580]  What is it?
[06:55.200 --> 06:56.940]  The J card or what's it called, Gavin?
[06:57.340 --> 06:57.880]  Super J?
[06:59.320 --> 07:00.060]  What's it called?
[07:00.360 --> 07:00.960]  J card?
[07:01.640 --> 07:04.160]  What's the clown card?
[07:04.380 --> 07:05.820]  What's the clown card called?
[07:07.560 --> 07:08.600]  Test card J.
[07:08.960 --> 07:09.820]  Test card J.
[07:10.100 --> 07:10.680]  Test card J.
[07:12.400 --> 07:13.380]  Super J.
[07:16.800 --> 07:17.760]  Super J.
[07:18.760 --> 07:21.340]  I think I started thinking of some pro wrestling stuff.
[07:21.660 --> 07:22.520]  I'm having a drink.
[07:22.660 --> 07:23.760]  I'm having a good time.
[07:24.320 --> 07:24.600]  Nice.
[07:24.920 --> 07:25.720]  Super J.
[07:26.200 --> 07:27.020]  And it's Donald Trump.
[07:27.900 --> 07:30.940]  I will also say, though, if you're watching this later,
[07:30.940 --> 07:35.100]  on the VOD or even now live and you want to see what you missed,
[07:35.740 --> 07:38.940]  we'll have the uncensored version available on Patreon for extra.
[07:39.400 --> 07:40.000]  That's right.
[07:41.060 --> 07:44.400]  So sign up for that Patreon at patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[07:44.520 --> 07:45.940]  That's where you support us directly.
[07:46.060 --> 07:47.600]  So that way we can keep doing this.
[07:47.900 --> 07:52.120]  And we don't have to have meetings where we go, how are we going to keep doing this?
[07:52.180 --> 07:56.720]  And it could just be us doing this and going, dog in a costume or something like that.
[07:57.420 --> 07:57.680]  Can we start?
[07:58.300 --> 07:59.520]  No, it's 11 o'clock.
[07:59.960 --> 08:02.720]  Depending on the actions of the people of Key West,
[08:02.860 --> 08:04.980]  that version might be the exact same as this version.
[08:05.160 --> 08:05.440]  Yeah.
[08:05.680 --> 08:06.280]  Yep. Yeah.
[08:07.120 --> 08:08.720]  Andrew, why are you so anxious to get started?
[08:08.960 --> 08:12.220]  I hate this is the least of all the bits we do.
[08:12.320 --> 08:13.720]  This is my least favorite bit.
[08:13.920 --> 08:14.840]  I just want to play.
[08:15.020 --> 08:16.180]  I just want to play the game.
[08:16.360 --> 08:17.160]  Let's just play the game.
[08:17.240 --> 08:18.440]  We're all here. We're live.
[08:18.560 --> 08:19.600]  Let's start playing the game.
[08:19.980 --> 08:22.220]  I just thought we had a whole time that we, like, figured out.
[08:22.320 --> 08:23.780]  Like, I thought 1015 was, like, really good.
[08:23.820 --> 08:25.520]  It's like when the sloppiness starts, but I mean...
[08:25.520 --> 08:26.900]  Let's go live at 1015.
[08:27.640 --> 08:29.140]  Let's start at sloppy clock.
[08:29.140 --> 08:29.920]  I hate this.
[08:30.220 --> 08:32.220]  I mean, why would we start at 1015?
[08:32.260 --> 08:33.080]  That's crazy, man.
[08:33.300 --> 08:36.580]  Are you trying to reclaim some personal time right now?
[08:37.360 --> 08:38.620]  No, I just want to play.
[08:38.820 --> 08:39.600]  I'm excited.
[08:39.700 --> 08:41.100]  Do you think that guy...
[08:41.100 --> 08:43.160]  Do you think that guy...
[08:43.160 --> 08:45.020]  Would you consider that a tuxedo over there?
[08:45.220 --> 08:45.520]  No.
[08:46.660 --> 08:47.300]  Not quite.
[08:47.380 --> 08:47.680]  All right.
[08:47.740 --> 08:48.740]  I mean, it's up to you guys.
[08:48.860 --> 08:50.300]  Hey, it's there's five of us.
[08:50.500 --> 08:51.400]  Let's take a vote.
[08:51.560 --> 08:53.840]  Do you want to start playing right now or do you want to wait?
[08:54.440 --> 08:56.440]  Holy shit. Gifted subs left and right.
[08:56.500 --> 08:56.840]  Look at that.
[08:56.940 --> 08:58.400]  Oh, thank you so much.
[08:58.400 --> 08:59.160]  How long?
[09:00.940 --> 09:03.580]  So we would be waiting seven minutes.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.480]  Yeah, regulation rat.
[09:06.440 --> 09:07.080]  Yeah. What?
[09:08.620 --> 09:09.020]  What?
[09:09.280 --> 09:10.220]  Who's regulation rat?
[09:10.720 --> 09:11.760]  I don't know, he gifted 10 subs.
[09:12.220 --> 09:13.440]  Oh, thank you, regulation rat.
[09:13.520 --> 09:16.560]  Dude, that's a fucking regulation kind thing to do.
[09:16.960 --> 09:18.200]  Is that trouble on the horizon?
[09:18.340 --> 09:18.680]  Hold on.
[09:18.800 --> 09:19.200]  Oh, no.
[09:19.660 --> 09:20.700]  I don't think so.
[09:20.820 --> 09:21.400]  What does that mean?
[09:21.940 --> 09:22.460]  Where am I looking?
[09:22.560 --> 09:23.480]  Oh, OK. It's all right.
[09:23.500 --> 09:23.840]  It's OK.
[09:23.940 --> 09:25.960]  The people crossing the crosswalk right now.
[09:26.720 --> 09:30.480]  Nick is like, this is going to be the only time he's watching like a hawk.
[09:30.900 --> 09:33.900]  Also, what we were talking about earlier is
[09:33.900 --> 09:35.900]  like when we were drafting these boards initially.
[09:36.780 --> 09:39.460]  Our regular bingo board, we still have a regular bingo board.
[09:39.880 --> 09:44.480]  Yeah, but our boo board, we all have our individual things.
[09:44.680 --> 09:46.020]  Nick can't piggyback on anyone.
[09:47.060 --> 09:47.420]  That's true.
[09:47.780 --> 09:49.300]  I don't know what he's going to do for that.
[09:49.640 --> 09:51.120]  Yeah, he couldn't steal tonight.
[09:51.600 --> 09:53.220]  Yeah. Well, not yet.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.300]  We'll see. OK.
[09:54.300 --> 09:56.660]  I've got a couple of I got a couple of workarounds.
[09:56.880 --> 09:58.880]  What? What do you win if you win the boo board?
[10:00.260 --> 10:01.420]  Oh, just like a bonus.
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.280]  It's a boo bonus.
[10:03.200 --> 10:04.140]  We do a cupcake.
[10:04.300 --> 10:05.500]  We could do a smaller cake.
[10:05.960 --> 10:07.380]  So yeah, a smaller boy like that.
[10:07.560 --> 10:08.920]  Cupcake. Smaller cake.
[10:09.200 --> 10:10.460]  Gavin, are you OK with smaller cake?
[10:10.960 --> 10:11.980]  Love it.
[10:12.060 --> 10:12.460]  Absolutely.
[10:12.800 --> 10:14.480]  Oh, they're vibing in that car.
[10:16.640 --> 10:18.180]  It's a party bus right there.
[10:18.240 --> 10:18.460]  Yep.
[10:20.000 --> 10:20.400]  Whoa.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.680]  Group costume.
[10:23.160 --> 10:24.020]  Man, that would count.
[10:24.020 --> 10:25.700]  God, that would be so...
[10:25.700 --> 10:28.020]  Dude, if we started that, we'd be so sick right now.
[10:28.320 --> 10:28.920]  You know what?
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.520]  I bet that would also count as can't sit down in.
[10:32.180 --> 10:32.860]  Yeah, probably.
[10:33.660 --> 10:35.280]  God damn, I'd be halfway done.
[10:36.180 --> 10:36.480]  Yep.
[10:37.160 --> 10:37.980]  Uh, what do you think?
[10:37.980 --> 10:38.440]  They're everywhere.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.280]  Do you guys want to start now?
[10:40.900 --> 10:42.400]  No, it's not 7.15 yet.
[10:42.860 --> 10:43.800]  Yeah, why don't you count us down?
[10:43.920 --> 10:44.900]  Count us down and we'll stop.
[10:45.660 --> 10:46.440]  Yeah, it's my time.
[10:46.700 --> 10:48.260]  7.15, South Block, I'm in the Pacific.
[10:51.040 --> 10:51.920]  Gavin, they don't want to start.
[10:51.980 --> 10:52.440]  We have to wait.
[10:52.440 --> 10:54.120]  We have to wait five minutes, Gavin.
[10:54.440 --> 10:56.460]  Hey, Gavin, why don't you tell us a five minute story?
[10:58.780 --> 10:59.500]  Once upon...
[10:59.500 --> 11:02.880]  Tell me how about in five minutes, explain the link that was broken.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.460]  You can take your time, you can do some research.
[11:05.120 --> 11:06.340]  Oh yeah, go take a look, Gavin.
[11:06.560 --> 11:09.200]  Isn't it important that we notice what people are telling us, though?
[11:09.720 --> 11:11.360]  Well, I think it wasn't for us.
[11:11.380 --> 11:12.440]  I think it was for the mods.
[11:13.540 --> 11:15.500]  The chat was talking only to the mods?
[11:15.860 --> 11:19.020]  Yeah, I'm assuming it was a link posted in the chat by someone.
[11:19.500 --> 11:20.520]  What the fuck is that?
[11:20.520 --> 11:22.760]  That's a costume that you don't know what it is.
[11:23.020 --> 11:24.640]  I have that. I have who's that?
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.880]  I know, the purple, whatever the guy is, he's wearing a crown on that lady.
[11:29.400 --> 11:31.020]  Is he? With shorts?
[11:31.160 --> 11:31.860]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11:32.040 --> 11:33.840]  Prince with shorts. And a baseball cap.
[11:34.960 --> 11:37.260]  I think he's just wearing a purple suit.
[11:37.420 --> 11:39.680]  I think he is... Oh yeah, I don't know.
[11:40.220 --> 11:41.040]  I don't know what he is.
[11:41.160 --> 11:42.280]  Yeah, you're right. This is a green.
[11:42.300 --> 11:43.120]  What is that?
[11:43.580 --> 11:47.120]  When you go to the subreddit right now,
[11:47.260 --> 11:50.160]  the two newest posts are the guys doing the handshake.
[11:50.520 --> 11:54.420]  Can we make that our new intro instead of the puke poll?
[11:58.260 --> 11:59.740]  Oh, man, this is so good.
[11:59.980 --> 12:00.920]  It's awesome.
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.360]  Oh, my God.
[12:02.780 --> 12:04.460]  It's just two friendly guys being friendly.
[12:04.960 --> 12:06.240]  Yeah, it was pretty adorable.
[12:08.760 --> 12:10.560]  They were just so excited to participate.
[12:10.980 --> 12:12.160]  Oh, God damn it.
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.660]  Wait, wait for four minutes.
[12:15.420 --> 12:16.980]  Deliberate. Come back.
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.960]  Think about it, would you have had it right there if you would have just said yes?
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.920]  He only said yes.
[12:21.980 --> 12:23.920]  I'm honoring your rules.
[12:24.340 --> 12:24.780]  Andrew.
[12:25.800 --> 12:26.920]  You had a chance not to.
[12:27.060 --> 12:28.260]  That's tough for you, dude.
[12:28.380 --> 12:32.740]  This is like when you invented the wheel the other day and then regretted it.
[12:33.280 --> 12:36.480]  Yeah. Which, by the way, we didn't talk about in the podcast at all,
[12:36.540 --> 12:37.320]  but it's going to come out.
[12:37.340 --> 12:39.900]  It's going to hit like a fucking hammer at some point.
[12:40.060 --> 12:41.460]  I totally forgot until just this moment.
[12:42.980 --> 12:47.520]  Yeah, it's all I've been thinking about since the kicker has reignited.
[12:48.060 --> 12:49.860]  Go to third wheel.
[12:49.980 --> 12:51.980]  And it's just like, oh, no.
[12:52.260 --> 12:53.520]  Is that guy Bucky's?
[12:54.240 --> 12:55.300]  I'll find out next week.
[12:55.500 --> 12:56.780]  He just had a Bucky shirt.
[12:56.920 --> 12:58.040]  I don't know if he was Bucky's.
[12:58.440 --> 13:02.880]  I hope everybody who's ever listened to fuck face or regulation
[13:02.880 --> 13:07.800]  or watch the gameplay watches that kicker picker re-picker when it comes out.
[13:08.980 --> 13:10.500]  It's so it's insane.
[13:10.700 --> 13:11.800]  It's it's something.
[13:12.040 --> 13:12.640]  When's it come out?
[13:12.700 --> 13:13.680]  It's on the calendar already, right?
[13:13.720 --> 13:14.080]  Next week.
[13:14.300 --> 13:15.240]  Next Friday.
[13:15.240 --> 13:17.620]  Yeah, I think it's Friday of next week.
[13:18.300 --> 13:20.320]  Oh, it is on the calendar for Friday of next week.
[13:20.700 --> 13:22.400]  That one, it got away from us.
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.000]  That one got away from us.
[13:24.100 --> 13:24.520]  That's good.
[13:24.600 --> 13:26.600]  That would change the future a little bit.
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.900]  Yeah, but who's to blame?
[13:29.960 --> 13:31.180]  Well, it's Andrew, clearly.
[13:31.940 --> 13:33.840]  It's definitely not just me.
[13:34.740 --> 13:36.060]  I brought up the thing.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.580]  You didn't want to do the thing.
[13:37.680 --> 13:39.320]  I said, OK, we don't have to do the thing.
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.660]  Then all of a sudden two wheels were created.
[13:41.660 --> 13:42.940]  And I said, OK.
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.960]  And then you guys filled the wheel with mayhem.
[13:47.280 --> 13:49.360]  And then you said, Andrew, why did you do this?
[13:50.400 --> 13:53.580]  I mean, you introduced the the concept was your fault.
[13:53.940 --> 13:57.980]  Oh, if I if I come up with the premise of a building,
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.080]  you can't blame me if someone else lights it on fire because I invent that's insane.
[14:03.660 --> 14:06.640]  But if the building didn't exist, it couldn't happen.
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.080]  So therefore, I can't blame you.
[14:08.540 --> 14:10.620]  Maybe just don't light the building on fire, Nick.
[14:10.620 --> 14:11.260]  What about that?
[14:11.880 --> 14:13.440]  Well, what if they were burning incense?
[14:13.900 --> 14:16.160]  Oh, that's a dangerous game.
[14:17.340 --> 14:20.440]  There's a lot of people who don't think incense will start fires.
[14:20.760 --> 14:22.180]  Yeah, I'm not fucking dead.
[14:22.200 --> 14:23.320]  I'm impressed with the audience.
[14:23.860 --> 14:25.040]  I'm very impressed with the audience.
[14:25.340 --> 14:29.800]  I, I have to say that when look, Andrew, if you were to start these right now,
[14:30.020 --> 14:34.720]  slow down one minute, slow down, less than a minute.
[14:35.440 --> 14:36.320]  Come back.
[14:41.920 --> 14:43.740]  That echo was so funny.
[14:46.920 --> 14:48.540]  Did that guy have a slice of cake?
[14:49.500 --> 14:50.040]  Oh, cool.
[14:50.760 --> 14:51.840]  40 seconds to go.
[14:52.400 --> 14:53.600]  Oh, wow. We're almost there.
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.260]  Are you ready, Andrew?
[14:55.420 --> 14:56.940]  I'm not ready at all.
[14:57.140 --> 14:58.560]  We're waiting for 15 minutes.
[14:59.220 --> 15:00.820]  Everyone, get your get your boards ready.
[15:00.900 --> 15:01.680]  Get your boo board.
[15:02.080 --> 15:02.700]  How are you guys?
[15:03.120 --> 15:05.480]  Are you guys more focused on your boo boards?
[15:05.780 --> 15:06.360]  100%
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.880]  We're only focusing on the boo board right now.
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.480]  I'm so locked in on boo boards, dude.
[15:10.060 --> 15:13.440]  Yeah, I'm definitely paying 60% attention to boo boards.
[15:13.620 --> 15:16.000]  Oh, 60? I'm up to like 80 on boo boards.
[15:17.240 --> 15:17.840]  Get out too late.
[15:18.140 --> 15:19.340]  That is get out too late.
[15:19.560 --> 15:21.380]  Put a fucking Santa hat on that kid.
[15:21.600 --> 15:22.660]  Oh, do I have it?
[15:22.740 --> 15:23.040]  Do I have it?
[15:23.040 --> 15:28.440]  It starts in five, four, three, two, one.
[15:28.940 --> 15:29.760]  Slop a clap.
[15:29.800 --> 15:30.260]  Here we go.
[15:30.260 --> 15:30.960]  He's out of frame.
[15:31.080 --> 15:31.660]  He's out of frame.
[15:31.720 --> 15:32.200]  Doesn't count.
[15:32.320 --> 15:34.040]  OK, I got 40 paper.
[15:36.840 --> 15:37.560]  Let's see.
[15:37.560 --> 15:39.960]  Oh, I got a hoof in it.
[15:40.100 --> 15:40.460]  Damn.
[15:40.760 --> 15:41.660]  I do have hoof in it.
[15:41.760 --> 15:42.020]  Yes.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.060]  OK, I do not.
[15:44.280 --> 15:44.620]  Oh, I do.
[15:44.720 --> 15:45.500]  She has a little hat.
[15:45.900 --> 15:46.520]  That's fun.
[15:46.960 --> 15:48.020]  Oh, that's a cute little hat.
[15:49.740 --> 15:50.360]  Gross, Gavin.
[15:50.440 --> 15:51.260]  Jesus Christ.
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.180]  Not in front of the camera.
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.960]  Hey, he has a pumpkin on his shirt.
[15:55.100 --> 15:56.180]  Is that a pumpkin themed outfit?
[15:59.640 --> 16:00.280]  Let's see.
[16:00.540 --> 16:02.100]  What do we got here?
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.640]  I don't even know where to start.
[16:03.640 --> 16:05.560]  Oh, man, I have luxury car.
[16:05.560 --> 16:08.980]  No, good luck.
[16:09.580 --> 16:11.320]  Oh, it's like I just shot this dick.
[16:11.600 --> 16:13.660]  Oh, does anybody have a dick grab?
[16:14.620 --> 16:14.920]  No.
[16:15.440 --> 16:16.220]  Oh, damn.
[16:16.780 --> 16:17.600]  I got head sheen.
[16:18.020 --> 16:19.320]  Was that head sheen just then?
[16:19.620 --> 16:20.480]  Yeah. The bald guy?
[16:20.900 --> 16:21.720]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[16:21.720 --> 16:22.560]  That would definitely be.
[16:22.600 --> 16:23.500]  I don't have either of those.
[16:23.620 --> 16:23.880]  Shit.
[16:25.540 --> 16:26.220]  Sunglasses at night.
[16:26.280 --> 16:28.000]  Put them on your fucking eyeballs, lady.
[16:29.400 --> 16:31.420]  Oh, man, I have high five on my board.
[16:31.720 --> 16:32.320]  Dickhead truck.
[16:32.580 --> 16:33.160]  Dickhead truck.
[16:33.600 --> 16:34.940]  Hey, you two dorks.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.480]  Come back and do the high five again.
[16:36.520 --> 16:37.860]  I have handshake on my board.
[16:37.880 --> 16:40.220]  I really need this.
[16:40.480 --> 16:43.080]  Does anybody have a fucking cape?
[16:43.700 --> 16:44.380]  Is that a thing?
[16:45.340 --> 16:46.400]  Whoa, that guy's just.
[16:46.640 --> 16:47.700]  Oh, that is close.
[16:47.960 --> 16:49.280]  Who's that? Can I do?
[16:49.380 --> 16:50.080]  Who's that for that?
[16:50.280 --> 16:51.800]  Yeah, I think you can.
[16:51.920 --> 16:54.740]  I think like that's like it's someone.
[16:55.360 --> 16:55.480]  Yeah.
[16:56.720 --> 16:59.580]  That little red riding hood, is that who she's supposed to be?
[16:59.980 --> 17:00.680]  Get out too late.
[17:00.800 --> 17:01.720]  I don't know. Is that?
[17:01.920 --> 17:04.920]  I don't know. Yeah.
[17:04.920 --> 17:08.220]  Boyfriend, there's an angel, but where's the devil?
[17:08.840 --> 17:09.580]  Oh, is that an athlete?
[17:09.980 --> 17:10.800]  Yes, it is.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.280]  Oh, shit. I got it.
[17:12.380 --> 17:14.720]  Is that is that a devil?
[17:14.860 --> 17:16.240]  What the fuck was that lady?
[17:17.260 --> 17:18.060]  All right.
[17:18.280 --> 17:19.780]  She's a devil or an Olympian.
[17:19.840 --> 17:20.540]  I couldn't tell.
[17:21.860 --> 17:22.640]  What's the difference?
[17:23.640 --> 17:25.020]  I horns, I guess.
[17:26.260 --> 17:28.440]  So did we go for kid out late on that kid there?
[17:28.660 --> 17:30.140]  Was that too old?
[17:30.240 --> 17:31.340]  No, I don't think he was young enough.
[17:31.480 --> 17:32.080]  Damn it.
[17:33.340 --> 17:37.480]  Okay, is that lady wearing she's a lime free candy?
[17:37.680 --> 17:39.840]  Dig deeper. Does anyone have offensive shirt?
[17:41.440 --> 17:44.020]  Oh, there's got matching shirts, matching shirts, matching outfits.
[17:44.860 --> 17:46.500]  Oh, I was going to buy a car.
[17:46.800 --> 17:48.660]  Oh, there's a dog.
[17:49.120 --> 17:51.200]  Dude, I have dog and hog.
[17:51.560 --> 17:52.760]  Luxury car. Luxury car.
[17:52.960 --> 17:55.080]  Luxury car. Definitely a luxury car.
[17:55.200 --> 17:56.280]  Hell yeah. Luxury car.
[17:56.480 --> 17:57.380]  That was just ears.
[17:57.640 --> 17:58.460]  And that's a luxury car.
[17:58.520 --> 18:01.080]  That's a luxury car. Guys, I just need to go.
[18:01.940 --> 18:04.180]  Wow. Lidless. Just need two more.
[18:04.300 --> 18:08.180]  Dude, I have double fisting candy bucket as my center square.
[18:08.400 --> 18:10.700]  Cowboy hat. Oh, cowboy hat.
[18:11.080 --> 18:13.060]  Oh, yeah, I got a cowboy hat.
[18:13.180 --> 18:13.720]  Cowboy hat.
[18:15.720 --> 18:17.300]  What's roll of rubbish again?
[18:18.240 --> 18:19.760]  So the trash guy that.
[18:20.060 --> 18:21.240]  Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.
[18:21.240 --> 18:22.040]  That's never mind.
[18:22.120 --> 18:24.040]  That's a fucking Corvette.
[18:24.840 --> 18:26.080]  Oh, that's some more head sheen.
[18:26.240 --> 18:27.440]  Yeah, piece of shit.
[18:28.180 --> 18:29.620]  Oh, that's that G-Wagon.
[18:29.880 --> 18:31.040]  That's just ears.
[18:31.040 --> 18:33.140]  That was a G-Wagon, I believe.
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.260]  Is that a kid out too late?
[18:36.380 --> 18:37.660]  No, no, he's old enough.
[18:37.800 --> 18:38.500]  Oh, those are just yeah.
[18:38.640 --> 18:40.840]  Oh, she's a rabbit.
[18:41.040 --> 18:42.060]  That's an Easter rabbit, right?
[18:43.400 --> 18:44.900]  I don't think that's an Easter rabbit.
[18:45.020 --> 18:45.920]  I think that's just a rabbit.
[18:46.620 --> 18:48.640]  Nobody just dresses as a rabbit.
[18:49.240 --> 18:51.760]  We saw like three people dressed as rabbits.
[18:52.240 --> 18:52.660]  Bugs Bunny.
[18:54.260 --> 18:56.880]  There's a skeleton and overdone costume.
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.100]  Yes.
[18:59.520 --> 19:00.280]  That's the first.
[19:00.340 --> 19:02.020]  That's the first skeleton we've seen.
[19:02.180 --> 19:03.280]  Yeah, it has to be.
[19:03.860 --> 19:05.840]  I don't think it's overdone at all.
[19:05.920 --> 19:06.800]  So that's not at all.
[19:06.920 --> 19:07.700]  Do I have that?
[19:10.560 --> 19:13.100]  Oh, I don't have to be overdone tonight specifically.
[19:13.620 --> 19:16.440]  Well, I think there has to be a consensus of it being overdone.
[19:16.560 --> 19:18.360]  I don't think skeletons overdone.
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.120]  Yeah, this is the first time we've seen it.
[19:21.400 --> 19:22.620]  Captain of the Titanic.
[19:22.740 --> 19:24.320]  Who's the commander?
[19:25.620 --> 19:28.420]  Such a specific that would be walking up to that guy, be like,
[19:28.420 --> 19:30.220]  what are you supposed to be the captain of the Titanic?
[19:31.420 --> 19:32.780]  Bernard Shaw specifically.
[19:35.200 --> 19:38.060]  What is this cheerleader across the street been doing?
[19:38.300 --> 19:39.000]  I don't know.
[19:39.020 --> 19:40.760]  She's just been standing there the whole fucking night.
[19:40.760 --> 19:41.740]  She's waiting for this person.
[19:42.540 --> 19:44.260]  Oh, oh, she is.
[19:44.360 --> 19:44.920]  Got picked up.
[19:45.380 --> 19:46.360]  Yep. Got picked up.
[19:46.420 --> 19:46.780]  Oh, pick up.
[19:46.780 --> 19:47.840]  Got picked up. Can I have that?
[19:48.360 --> 19:48.880]  Chugging it.
[19:49.100 --> 19:49.500]  No.
[19:50.060 --> 19:50.680]  Chugging it.
[19:50.780 --> 19:51.800]  Oh, was that Chug?
[19:51.880 --> 19:52.400]  Yeah, it was.
[19:52.560 --> 19:53.300]  Oh, yeah. Big time.
[19:53.740 --> 19:54.800]  Yeah. Damn.
[19:55.580 --> 19:57.120]  I see some guys going to town.
[19:58.100 --> 19:58.740]  Oh, skeletons.
[19:58.860 --> 19:59.840]  There's a costume.
[20:01.360 --> 20:02.980]  Uh, yeah, I'm getting closer.
[20:03.100 --> 20:04.000]  I might have to.
[20:04.000 --> 20:05.400]  I might have to acquiesce.
[20:05.540 --> 20:05.960]  I think so.
[20:06.200 --> 20:06.840]  On the next one.
[20:06.860 --> 20:07.440]  I think it might be.
[20:07.500 --> 20:08.800]  I think it might be overdone, Gavin.
[20:08.860 --> 20:09.380]  You might be right.
[20:09.500 --> 20:10.060]  Dumb hat.
[20:11.200 --> 20:12.780]  It's a mixing bowl or something.
[20:13.080 --> 20:13.320]  Yeah.
[20:15.760 --> 20:16.760]  Oh, I have dumb hat.
[20:16.820 --> 20:17.020]  Sweet.
[20:18.340 --> 20:18.660]  Yawning.
[20:18.940 --> 20:19.580]  Bachelorette party.
[20:19.920 --> 20:20.240]  Wheelchair.
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.160]  Anybody seen a wheelchair?
[20:21.500 --> 20:22.000]  Nighttime shade.
[20:22.160 --> 20:22.460]  Never.
[20:22.620 --> 20:23.060]  No, not yet.
[20:23.240 --> 20:23.640]  Damn it.
[20:23.680 --> 20:24.200]  I've got a wheelchair.
[20:24.520 --> 20:24.740]  One time.
[20:24.980 --> 20:25.120]  Shit.
[20:25.620 --> 20:27.180]  When Andrew didn't have a wheelchair.
[20:28.700 --> 20:29.180]  Formal attire.
[20:30.860 --> 20:31.340]  No.
[20:34.400 --> 20:35.160]  Cowboy hat again.
[20:35.160 --> 20:35.900]  More cowboy hats.
[20:37.060 --> 20:37.820]  Spider-Man.
[20:38.040 --> 20:38.740]  Oh, Spider-Man.
[20:39.460 --> 20:41.780]  Oh, damn it.
[20:41.860 --> 20:43.300]  Was there a Spider-Man movie this summer?
[20:43.800 --> 20:45.000]  It's a practical costume.
[20:45.120 --> 20:45.520]  I'm upset.
[20:47.360 --> 20:48.900]  I think it's supposed to be Cyclops.
[20:48.980 --> 20:49.660]  I don't think it's Wolverine.
[20:51.080 --> 20:51.560]  Damn.
[20:52.080 --> 20:54.060]  He's got the, I think he has like red sunglasses on.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.240]  Or it's Gambit.
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.800]  Yeah, everybody loves Gambit.
[21:00.040 --> 21:01.940]  Walk down this way, costume people.
[21:03.240 --> 21:06.240]  I'm trying, there might be fishnets over there.
[21:06.480 --> 21:08.280]  I need you to come down, kid Z.
[21:09.480 --> 21:11.920]  I can't believe we haven't seen a penis costume yet.
[21:12.640 --> 21:14.900]  That is a Gambit costume, by the way.
[21:15.440 --> 21:15.760]  Yes.
[21:16.140 --> 21:16.920]  Oh, that is Gambit.
[21:17.100 --> 21:17.300]  Yeah.
[21:17.420 --> 21:19.380]  I think, I think there was a guy with him that was like.
[21:19.380 --> 21:20.060]  Oh, I got that then.
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.580]  Summer movie representative.
[21:21.880 --> 21:22.140]  Damn.
[21:22.280 --> 21:22.500]  There you go.
[21:22.960 --> 21:23.780]  Damn, shit.
[21:23.780 --> 21:25.100]  I knew you'd get that before me.
[21:27.760 --> 21:28.720]  Where's that Scooby-Doo guy?
[21:28.740 --> 21:30.060]  Does anybody have a fan of the band Thrice?
[21:30.160 --> 21:31.160]  Cause that guy just walked by.
[21:34.860 --> 21:35.180]  What?
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.580]  Oh, what the fuck?
[21:36.960 --> 21:38.880]  Is that a, is that, that's formal wear.
[21:39.200 --> 21:40.380]  That's not a tuxedo though.
[21:40.440 --> 21:41.160]  God damn it.
[21:41.180 --> 21:42.680]  I wish it was so, is that a tuxedo?
[21:43.540 --> 21:45.560]  No, it was, it was too long.
[21:45.620 --> 21:46.380]  Dead parrot head.
[21:46.580 --> 21:47.900]  That was like a tuxedo with tails.
[21:48.400 --> 21:48.820]  I got that.
[21:48.820 --> 21:49.560]  Oh, maybe it was.
[21:49.660 --> 21:50.380]  I got two identical.
[21:50.400 --> 21:51.140]  Yeah, I think that counts, dude.
[21:51.180 --> 21:52.300]  That's a regulation costume.
[21:52.880 --> 21:53.140]  I got.
[21:53.160 --> 21:53.440]  You know what?
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.000]  The tails.
[21:54.140 --> 21:54.360]  Yeah.
[21:54.420 --> 21:57.180]  I got two identical costumes here on the top, right?
[21:58.020 --> 21:59.640]  I need a hot dog costume badly.
[21:59.680 --> 22:01.160]  Are they the twins from The Shining?
[22:04.200 --> 22:05.620]  Pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin.
[22:05.720 --> 22:06.460]  That is a pumpkin.
[22:06.620 --> 22:07.640]  That's not a pumpkin-themed outfit.
[22:07.660 --> 22:08.640]  That's just the ice.
[22:08.800 --> 22:09.520]  That's pumpkin.
[22:10.300 --> 22:11.000]  That's pumpkin-themed outfit.
[22:11.000 --> 22:12.520]  No, I gotta go with Gavin on this one.
[22:12.560 --> 22:13.240]  I don't think it is.
[22:13.440 --> 22:14.000]  Andrew, you're the decider.
[22:14.000 --> 22:14.820]  I guess I've been outvoted.
[22:15.540 --> 22:16.140]  God damn it.
[22:16.180 --> 22:16.620]  No, you weren't.
[22:16.680 --> 22:17.280]  There's two of them.
[22:17.660 --> 22:18.560]  Oh, we got dogs.
[22:19.020 --> 22:19.780]  Sunglasses are too late.
[22:19.980 --> 22:20.740]  Oh, there's a dog.
[22:21.040 --> 22:21.880]  Oh, dog is too late.
[22:22.540 --> 22:23.680]  I need a motorcycle.
[22:23.920 --> 22:24.980]  Motorcycle, come into frame.
[22:26.080 --> 22:26.980]  I got dog out too late.
[22:29.500 --> 22:29.860]  Motorcycle.
[22:30.860 --> 22:32.500]  Hey, we counted that as formal attire, right?
[22:32.500 --> 22:33.500]  Is that dog wear your costume?
[22:34.060 --> 22:34.520]  Yeah, we did.
[22:34.640 --> 22:35.900]  I, no, I think it's just dogs.
[22:36.320 --> 22:38.080]  I just need a dead parrot head and I win.
[22:38.580 --> 22:38.940]  Wow.
[22:39.660 --> 22:40.020]  Already?
[22:43.380 --> 22:46.160]  Dogs, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle.
[22:46.600 --> 22:48.140]  Put those dogs in a fucking pair of bat wings or something, you asshole.
[22:48.600 --> 22:49.320]  Come back.
[22:50.080 --> 22:52.200]  How are none of those people Wolverine?
[22:54.040 --> 22:55.300]  Oh, is that a bachelorette party?
[22:55.660 --> 22:55.860]  No, dogs!
[22:56.460 --> 22:59.220]  That is, uh, that's got to be a bachelorette party, right?
[22:59.960 --> 23:00.260]  Where?
[23:00.360 --> 23:00.720]  I think so.
[23:01.040 --> 23:04.700]  Those two ladies that had the pink clothes and the bow and stuff and the matching hats?
[23:04.700 --> 23:05.480]  No, those are costumes.
[23:06.180 --> 23:07.580]  Those were bachelorette costumes.
[23:08.180 --> 23:08.740]  All right, fine.
[23:08.820 --> 23:10.840]  No, bachelorette costumes?
[23:11.820 --> 23:12.940]  I mean, that's what they were dressed in.
[23:12.940 --> 23:15.100]  They were dressed the same way as every bachelorette party.
[23:15.320 --> 23:15.800]  That guy looks cool.
[23:15.800 --> 23:17.580]  Oh, see, he's supposed to be Iron Man.
[23:17.700 --> 23:18.500]  See another skeleton?
[23:18.500 --> 23:19.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[23:19.960 --> 23:20.360]  Overdose.
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.600]  Iron Man on a budget.
[23:21.700 --> 23:23.700]  He built that costume in a cave with parts.
[23:28.320 --> 23:29.440]  Eat some candy.
[23:29.580 --> 23:30.900]  Now, Spider-Man is a video game.
[23:30.940 --> 23:32.180]  Does that count as a video game costume?
[23:33.460 --> 23:33.860]  Yes.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.380]  Yeah, I'd say so.
[23:35.660 --> 23:36.320]  I would say so.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.420]  I'll give it to you.
[23:37.500 --> 23:37.600]  Yeah.
[23:37.640 --> 23:38.180]  Oh, my God.
[23:38.300 --> 23:40.740]  That lady was just, uh, air humping.
[23:41.800 --> 23:42.080]  Ew.
[23:42.600 --> 23:43.340]  Is that dancing?
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.840]  Yeah, I think he could.
[23:46.460 --> 23:50.960]  See, this is when we're on the main card stuff where Nick doesn't see it, but he'll take it.
[23:51.420 --> 23:51.560]  Is that?
[23:51.660 --> 23:52.920]  No, but I'm saying, does that count?
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.260]  That lady's just like a piñata.
[23:57.400 --> 23:58.620]  Gambit dropped one of his cards.
[23:58.780 --> 23:59.480]  Is he a litter bug?
[24:01.760 --> 24:02.460]  That'd be a yes.
[24:03.920 --> 24:04.620]  Oh, man.
[24:04.680 --> 24:05.500]  What do I need?
[24:07.580 --> 24:10.860]  The guy, he looks like Joey Graceffa dressing as Gambit.
[24:11.640 --> 24:12.260]  Yeah, kind of.
[24:12.760 --> 24:13.600]  Witch without a broom!
[24:14.000 --> 24:14.480]  Witch without a broom!
[24:14.480 --> 24:15.960]  Witch without a broom!
[24:16.660 --> 24:17.040]  Damn!
[24:17.580 --> 24:18.380]  And fake doctor!
[24:19.880 --> 24:20.320]  What?
[24:20.480 --> 24:20.920]  Oh, yeah.
[24:21.180 --> 24:21.920]  Doctor or nurse?
[24:22.580 --> 24:22.700]  Yep.
[24:23.480 --> 24:25.280]  I'm a peanut butter jar away from a win.
[24:25.900 --> 24:26.620]  Oh, cool.
[24:27.540 --> 24:28.220]  Dude, that's awesome.
[24:28.320 --> 24:29.360]  Holding hands, is that one?
[24:29.440 --> 24:30.160]  Is it a man holding hands?
[24:31.100 --> 24:31.920]  Oh, good call it.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.040]  I don't know.
[24:33.740 --> 24:40.440]  What if some dude just walking by is drunk and just spooning out peanut butter with a, you know, to keep himself going?
[24:41.840 --> 24:42.700]  Think those are wigs?
[24:43.000 --> 24:43.940]  That's not fast.
[24:45.960 --> 24:47.460]  Oh, is this a pirate?
[24:47.860 --> 24:49.220]  Is that a real life dead guy?
[24:51.000 --> 24:51.500]  No.
[24:53.260 --> 24:54.100]  Oh, it's Woody.
[24:57.830 --> 24:59.530]  I need a scream mask.
[24:59.650 --> 25:00.910]  I need fake blood.
[25:01.770 --> 25:03.350]  I'm not sure that lady was a real nun.
[25:05.930 --> 25:07.510]  Dude, I need a lot of...
[25:07.510 --> 25:09.710]  I want, I have Halloween bouncer.
[25:10.570 --> 25:12.110]  I got to get Halloween bouncer.
[25:14.350 --> 25:16.690]  Oh, she's fucking, she, oh!
[25:17.770 --> 25:21.170]  Drive by, uh, Halloween car thing.
[25:21.270 --> 25:21.930]  Somebody has that.
[25:22.230 --> 25:23.330]  Oh, that was Elvis, was it?
[25:24.590 --> 25:25.770]  Elvis in the back of that car?
[25:26.110 --> 25:26.830]  I didn't see it.
[25:27.350 --> 25:29.950]  In the back of the thing that's just good on screen there, that Elvis, was it?
[25:29.970 --> 25:30.610]  Was it Elvis?
[25:30.730 --> 25:31.910]  I didn't, I didn't see it.
[25:32.190 --> 25:33.310]  That's a real life dead guy if that's Elvis.
[25:34.090 --> 25:34.550]  That's true.
[25:35.130 --> 25:35.670]  That would have been.
[25:35.670 --> 25:36.270]  Did anyone else see it?
[25:36.350 --> 25:36.690]  That's true.
[25:36.750 --> 25:37.230]  I didn't see it though.
[25:37.230 --> 25:38.330]  Hey chat, that's a pumpkin shirt.
[25:38.430 --> 25:38.950]  That's a pumpkin outfit.
[25:39.030 --> 25:39.350]  That's a pumpkin outfit.
[25:39.410 --> 25:40.630]  I didn't see jeans and flip flops though.
[25:40.830 --> 25:41.410]  If anybody wants to...
[25:41.410 --> 25:41.930]  Oh, thanks chat.
[25:42.110 --> 25:43.090]  It, it was Elvis.
[25:44.030 --> 25:45.890]  Well, you can't use the chat to verify.
[25:45.890 --> 25:47.070]  Yeah, they can't be trusted.
[25:47.770 --> 25:49.990]  Because it's a bunch of people going, Oh my God, Gavin, talk to me.
[25:50.590 --> 25:50.810]  Yeah.
[25:50.810 --> 25:52.850]  They said, Oh my God, Gavin said, Oh my God.
[25:52.850 --> 25:53.150]  The links.
[25:53.210 --> 25:54.590]  They definitely have a point there, Gavin.
[25:57.170 --> 25:59.350]  Gavin, if I saw Elvis, I would say it's Elvis.
[25:59.870 --> 26:00.170]  I would.
[26:00.270 --> 26:01.870]  I was looking at him, but I got outvoted.
[26:03.050 --> 26:05.510]  Gavin, you sound like people every day.
[26:05.690 --> 26:06.350]  I saw Elvis.
[26:09.190 --> 26:10.690]  Oh, a text has come in.
[26:11.270 --> 26:12.370]  A text from Jack Bottillo.
[26:12.730 --> 26:13.770]  He says it was Elvis.
[26:14.750 --> 26:15.330]  That's too bad.
[26:15.930 --> 26:16.770]  Oh, that's a shame.
[26:16.770 --> 26:17.830]  He sent you a clip of it.
[26:17.890 --> 26:20.250]  We all know that guy's got an agenda.
[26:20.910 --> 26:22.410]  Listen, if somebody clipped Elvis.
[26:23.510 --> 26:26.670]  I'm willing to reverse the decision, but I, I didn't see it.
[26:26.870 --> 26:28.170]  Honestly, he's just like the chat.
[26:29.050 --> 26:31.250]  Jack's just like the chat going, Oh my God, Gavin, talk to me.
[26:31.290 --> 26:31.950]  Gavin, talk to me.
[26:32.030 --> 26:36.270]  So it's like, nah, I'm not going to reverse it because there's too
[26:36.270 --> 26:37.910]  many deep fakes of Elvis anyway.
[26:40.770 --> 26:42.830]  Maybe Elvis will come back around with Santa.
[26:44.070 --> 26:45.650]  Cross my card, motherfuckers.
[26:45.690 --> 26:46.470]  Let's do it.
[26:47.950 --> 26:48.670]  Be afraid.
[26:49.990 --> 26:50.870]  What else do I have?
[26:51.290 --> 26:52.490]  Ooh, a kid out late.
[26:52.650 --> 26:55.790]  There's definitely a kid out too late across the street there, Geoff.
[26:56.230 --> 26:57.050]  Oh my God.
[26:57.110 --> 26:58.430]  It's a little, Oh my God.
[26:58.430 --> 26:59.110]  It's a little toddler.
[26:59.250 --> 27:00.870]  That is way out late for a kid.
[27:01.010 --> 27:03.010]  Oh yeah, that is a kid way out too late.
[27:03.190 --> 27:04.010]  Is that kid in a costume?
[27:04.490 --> 27:05.430]  He has a cowboy hat on.
[27:05.710 --> 27:06.810]  Yes, he does.
[27:07.050 --> 27:08.110]  He absolutely does.
[27:08.350 --> 27:08.690]  Wow.
[27:10.010 --> 27:11.030]  That worked out for me.
[27:11.470 --> 27:11.970]  Oh, skateboard.
[27:13.130 --> 27:13.950]  Yeah, skateboard.
[27:14.310 --> 27:17.470]  I think that might be like the first skateboard I've ever seen.
[27:17.470 --> 27:20.670]  Can I mark the Tony Stark costume as celebrity lookalike?
[27:22.610 --> 27:23.630]  What about Spider-Man?
[27:24.770 --> 27:25.790]  There's a group costume.
[27:27.430 --> 27:33.310]  Oh, I've not even been looking for costumed background scooters.
[27:33.350 --> 27:34.010]  Oh, my God.
[27:35.950 --> 27:37.330]  If I can use the cone, I got it.
[27:37.930 --> 27:38.410]  For what?
[27:39.010 --> 27:39.250]  For what?
[27:39.470 --> 27:42.570]  Group costume, can't sit down, impractical, awkward costume.
[27:42.570 --> 27:44.530]  I think they can easily sit down.
[27:44.730 --> 27:45.550]  What are you talking about?
[27:46.490 --> 27:48.750]  Earlier, you guys said that you would have counted it.
[27:48.890 --> 27:49.490]  No, we didn't.
[27:49.550 --> 27:49.890]  Yeah, we did.
[27:49.950 --> 27:50.190]  You said it.
[27:50.230 --> 27:50.470]  We did.
[27:50.690 --> 27:50.810]  No.
[27:51.890 --> 27:52.830]  No, Nick's right.
[27:53.750 --> 27:54.250]  Shut up.
[27:54.290 --> 27:55.030]  You don't even know.
[27:57.270 --> 27:58.630]  Nick, roll the fingers up the link.
[27:58.850 --> 27:59.530]  Is this Elvis again?
[28:00.170 --> 28:00.570]  It's Elvis?
[28:01.070 --> 28:01.290]  Where?
[28:01.710 --> 28:03.350]  Elvis on the back of that thing going up the street.
[28:03.690 --> 28:04.710]  You can't tell from here.
[28:04.950 --> 28:05.690]  I can't make out who that is.
[28:05.770 --> 28:07.010]  I can't tell who it's Elvis.
[28:07.990 --> 28:09.150]  He's too small.
[28:09.970 --> 28:11.970]  Gavin, maybe if this was 1080.
[28:11.970 --> 28:13.670]  This is only 720p.
[28:13.790 --> 28:14.430]  I'm sorry.
[28:15.710 --> 28:20.410]  Elvis just looping in the distance over and over again all night.
[28:21.010 --> 28:23.370]  But never going past the camera again.
[28:26.630 --> 28:28.990]  And you keep asking me where Elvis is.
[28:29.050 --> 28:30.850]  He's in the same spot every time you ask me.
[28:31.310 --> 28:32.250]  Oh, there's an angel.
[28:33.370 --> 28:33.710]  Oh.
[28:34.970 --> 28:35.950]  Where's the devil?
[28:37.530 --> 28:38.890]  Is that a devil?
[28:39.210 --> 28:39.930]  That's Goofy.
[28:40.170 --> 28:40.810]  It ain't a devil.
[28:40.810 --> 28:41.870]  No, that's Max.
[28:42.050 --> 28:42.970]  That's Goofy's son.
[28:42.970 --> 28:43.490]  Instrument.
[28:43.750 --> 28:44.150]  No.
[28:44.850 --> 28:46.190]  That's Max, Goofy's kid.
[28:47.230 --> 28:48.390]  There's a little dinosaur.
[28:48.950 --> 28:49.110]  Yeah.
[28:51.230 --> 28:52.190]  Little dino.
[28:57.730 --> 28:58.950]  Wait, he dropped something.
[28:59.130 --> 29:00.710]  Is Goofy a dog?
[29:01.190 --> 29:01.410]  Yeah.
[29:01.990 --> 29:02.370]  Yeah.
[29:02.730 --> 29:04.730]  So that's a people in a dog costume.
[29:04.790 --> 29:05.470]  Oh, get real.
[29:05.810 --> 29:07.350]  Would you say it's a...
[29:07.350 --> 29:08.950]  Would you say that dude's hot?
[29:09.150 --> 29:10.490]  Would you say it's a hot dog costume?
[29:11.530 --> 29:13.090]  I will if it gets me the point.
[29:13.330 --> 29:13.770]  He's kind of sexy.
[29:14.390 --> 29:15.330]  There's Spider-Man again.
[29:15.870 --> 29:17.930]  Are you fishing for me to say that guy's hot?
[29:18.790 --> 29:20.890]  Yeah, if he does, I'll fucking win.
[29:22.590 --> 29:23.970]  Oh, what?
[29:24.070 --> 29:24.510]  There's another baby.
[29:24.670 --> 29:26.530]  Put your mask on, Peter Parker.
[29:26.690 --> 29:27.630]  Jesus Christ.
[29:27.990 --> 29:29.050]  Everyone can see it's you.
[29:30.830 --> 29:32.110]  What's how the third movie happened?
[29:32.990 --> 29:34.630]  Is this guy supposed to be a devil?
[29:35.010 --> 29:35.790]  Yeah, he's got a tail.
[29:36.750 --> 29:39.430]  So all you have to do is keep your eyes peeled for an angel.
[29:40.030 --> 29:41.890]  The angel just left the frame.
[29:42.630 --> 29:44.330]  God damn, the angel just went inside.
[29:45.870 --> 29:47.670]  I think there's another devil in the back there with the horns.
[29:49.950 --> 29:53.550]  Oh, yeah, in the in the T-shirt or I guess in the button up shirt there.
[29:53.590 --> 29:55.010]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:55.450 --> 29:56.130]  Oh, yeah.
[29:56.330 --> 29:56.730]  Devil.
[29:57.450 --> 29:59.670]  Lady, come on. Step back.
[30:00.210 --> 30:00.230]  Whoa.
[30:01.390 --> 30:04.390]  Is that person cosplaying the other guy?
[30:04.770 --> 30:05.890]  I think they're Pitbull.
[30:07.590 --> 30:09.090]  I think they're all Pitbull.
[30:09.670 --> 30:11.170]  Yeah, it's a bunch of Pitbulls.
[30:11.470 --> 30:12.330]  It's already looking like...
[30:12.330 --> 30:14.690]  This bouncer is bouncing right now with this fucking ID.
[30:15.670 --> 30:16.110]  Tricycle.
[30:16.990 --> 30:19.530]  Andrew, if you're marking celebrity lookalikes, oh my, you're crazy.
[30:19.670 --> 30:19.970]  Bouncer bouncing.
[30:20.330 --> 30:21.630]  Pitbull isn't a celebrity.
[30:23.570 --> 30:25.350]  They're dressed to look like him.
[30:26.370 --> 30:28.250]  Yeah, I mean, he's kind of got a point.
[30:28.610 --> 30:29.610]  There's an overdone skeleton.
[30:30.030 --> 30:30.930]  Look, skeleton again.
[30:32.330 --> 30:33.550]  I'm eating crow on that one.
[30:33.730 --> 30:34.630]  I'll admit it.
[30:36.050 --> 30:37.490]  This guy's dressed as security.
[30:39.530 --> 30:41.150]  Does that mean he's a Halloween bouncer?
[30:42.590 --> 30:43.290]  No, no.
[30:45.730 --> 30:46.650]  Just checking.
[30:49.330 --> 30:50.770]  Listen, it's important to ask.
[30:51.010 --> 30:51.410]  Absolutely.
[30:52.130 --> 30:52.370]  Yeah.
[30:53.550 --> 30:54.650]  What's happening here?
[30:56.030 --> 30:57.630]  Oh, is that Elvis across the street?
[30:58.230 --> 30:58.790]  Where?
[30:59.270 --> 31:00.610]  I don't see anything.
[31:00.930 --> 31:01.730]  Oh, damn it.
[31:01.730 --> 31:02.730]  What, the guy in white?
[31:02.970 --> 31:03.850]  You can't tell anything.
[31:04.130 --> 31:04.910]  It's like the Phantom of the Opera.
[31:05.010 --> 31:05.870]  What are you talking about?
[31:06.950 --> 31:10.810]  Oh, you keep not telling us...
[31:10.810 --> 31:11.190]  Who are you talking about?
[31:11.470 --> 31:13.930]  You keep not telling us where he is.
[31:18.490 --> 31:19.250]  Where's Elvis?
[31:19.850 --> 31:22.990]  I think it was the same Elvis from the back of the car earlier.
[31:23.050 --> 31:24.630]  Oh, that guy's on a...
[31:24.630 --> 31:25.530]  Does that count as a wheelchair?
[31:26.710 --> 31:26.990]  No.
[31:27.450 --> 31:28.850]  A little motorized scooter.
[31:29.270 --> 31:29.470]  Damn.
[31:29.850 --> 31:31.110]  Yeah, it's just a scooter, I'm afraid.
[31:31.670 --> 31:32.090]  Sorry, Geoff.
[31:32.510 --> 31:32.910]  Thanks.
[31:37.080 --> 31:37.940]  Son of a bitch.
[31:40.060 --> 31:41.520]  So Max is a dog, right?
[31:43.700 --> 31:46.860]  You're not getting dressed as a dog costume, whatever.
[31:47.420 --> 31:51.340]  Unless somebody walks by and goes, God damn, that goofy is hot.
[31:58.000 --> 32:00.260]  I'm so excited to not see Elvis again.
[32:01.260 --> 32:01.860]  We'll see.
[32:02.100 --> 32:02.220]  I know.
[32:04.040 --> 32:05.560]  That was a Mr. Potato Head over there.
[32:05.800 --> 32:07.720]  That's where the Elvis was, by the way.
[32:07.840 --> 32:10.640]  And I was at a SpongeBob with him.
[32:10.640 --> 32:14.140]  That's where I'll look next time you yell about him.
[32:14.860 --> 32:15.200]  OK.
[32:16.600 --> 32:18.200]  I think it's a dog costume, Nick.
[32:19.080 --> 32:20.420]  I'm on your side on that one.
[32:20.440 --> 32:21.940]  Oh, is he costumed?
[32:22.280 --> 32:22.880]  Oh, oh.
[32:24.700 --> 32:25.400]  Rick Rubin.
[32:28.840 --> 32:31.220]  Man, there are fireworks going off outside my house.
[32:31.580 --> 32:32.300]  Oh, really?
[32:32.720 --> 32:33.160]  Oh, yeah.
[32:33.340 --> 32:34.820]  For Halloween fireworks?
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.000]  I guess so.
[32:41.000 --> 32:41.540]  Who are...
[32:41.540 --> 32:42.860]  I'm shocked by the lack of peanut butter so far.
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.140]  Who are these people supposed to be?
[32:45.480 --> 32:47.680]  Oh, oh, they're from the...
[32:47.680 --> 32:48.800]  Oh, it's the Malone.
[32:49.280 --> 32:50.000]  It's the Wacky Bandits.
[32:50.320 --> 32:51.000]  It's the Wacky Bandits.
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.180]  Dude, that's amazing.
[32:52.600 --> 32:53.340]  That's really great.
[32:53.680 --> 32:54.720]  That's a pretty good one.
[32:55.540 --> 32:57.480]  The bold head through the beanie is great.
[32:57.840 --> 32:58.920]  Yeah, that's really good.
[32:58.960 --> 32:59.780]  That's a great costume.
[33:00.760 --> 33:01.920]  Good on you guys.
[33:07.200 --> 33:09.160]  Why isn't anybody a hot dog?
[33:10.520 --> 33:11.320]  Oh, oh.
[33:11.800 --> 33:12.800]  Oh, it's close.
[33:13.100 --> 33:13.700]  It's close.
[33:13.880 --> 33:14.600]  That's an angel.
[33:14.780 --> 33:15.100]  Angel.
[33:15.300 --> 33:16.120]  Is that lady a devil?
[33:16.580 --> 33:17.300]  I don't think so.
[33:17.300 --> 33:17.920]  Is that a devil?
[33:18.280 --> 33:19.720]  Yeah, she's got a devil tail.
[33:20.140 --> 33:21.320]  She's got a devil tail.
[33:21.340 --> 33:21.920]  Yeah, that's a devil.
[33:22.080 --> 33:22.820]  That's a devil.
[33:22.820 --> 33:24.280]  You got an angel devil, Geoff.
[33:24.560 --> 33:26.080]  Yeah, I still don't have it.
[33:26.200 --> 33:26.720]  God damn.
[33:28.760 --> 33:30.180]  Where are the Wolverines?
[33:31.240 --> 33:31.920]  Where's Deadpool?
[33:32.520 --> 33:34.200]  Where are all the penises?
[33:36.440 --> 33:38.560]  OK, well, where are the impractical costumes?
[33:39.400 --> 33:40.960]  Where are the impractical jokers?
[33:42.480 --> 33:43.460]  I think they grew it up.
[33:44.240 --> 33:44.460]  What?
[33:44.620 --> 33:45.360]  Well, one of them left.
[33:45.660 --> 33:46.400]  No, no, just one left.
[33:46.420 --> 33:47.060]  Is that real?
[33:47.180 --> 33:48.280]  Yeah, yeah.
[33:48.280 --> 33:49.500]  He left a couple of seasons ago.
[33:49.680 --> 33:49.960]  Yeah.
[33:52.940 --> 33:55.860]  It's just not the same, you know, like he needed the realness.
[33:56.480 --> 33:58.920]  Like continuing the Beatles without Lennon.
[33:59.040 --> 33:59.700]  It got too corporate.
[33:59.960 --> 34:01.600]  I think he was having marital issues.
[34:01.600 --> 34:04.540]  We didn't sell Haunter to network.
[34:04.800 --> 34:04.940]  Dog, dog, dog.
[34:05.140 --> 34:05.600]  That is a dog.
[34:06.120 --> 34:11.480]  We didn't sell Haunter to their network because they thought we were just another impractical jokers.
[34:11.800 --> 34:12.440]  And they already had them.
[34:12.580 --> 34:13.200]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:13.200 --> 34:17.500]  You wouldn't want to have too many wildly successful shows.
[34:17.940 --> 34:18.160]  Yeah.
[34:18.840 --> 34:20.620]  They're like, we've already got the impractical jokers.
[34:20.700 --> 34:21.580]  We feel like this is covered.
[34:21.580 --> 34:24.640]  Yeah, we got impractical jokers and it makes us a ton of money.
[34:24.720 --> 34:27.800]  We wouldn't want to replicate or duplicate that in any way, shape or form.
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.620]  So is that a wheelchair being pushed across the street there?
[34:30.900 --> 34:31.700]  Yes, it is.
[34:31.760 --> 34:32.980]  No, it's a stroller.
[34:33.280 --> 34:34.160]  It's a stroller.
[34:34.560 --> 34:35.440]  Are you out of your mind?
[34:35.440 --> 34:36.520]  It's a chair with wheels on it.
[34:36.520 --> 34:37.300]  What are you doing?
[34:37.300 --> 34:42.420]  The fact that you thought that that was a wheelchair ruins all your Elvis credibility.
[34:42.720 --> 34:43.120]  Absolutely.
[34:43.460 --> 34:44.240]  It's the same distance.
[34:44.720 --> 34:46.100]  Yeah, the wheelchair thing was a joke.
[34:46.180 --> 34:47.440]  Elvis was actually there.
[34:48.300 --> 34:50.060]  Hey, that guy's digging in the trash can.
[34:50.060 --> 34:51.740]  Does anybody have guy digging in trash can?
[34:52.560 --> 34:53.820]  No. Now he's drinking it.
[34:53.900 --> 34:56.360]  I would say, Nick, if you were looking for a dead head.
[34:56.760 --> 34:58.840]  I got I got dead parrot head.
[34:58.840 --> 35:00.540]  Dead parrot head. You got it right there.
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.000]  Dead parrot head? Yeah. Bingo.
[35:02.500 --> 35:04.280]  Hey, hey, Nick.
[35:04.620 --> 35:08.060]  Do you feel like do you feel like you've been watching this kid
[35:08.060 --> 35:10.560]  who's like Max from Goofy for like a really long time?
[35:11.740 --> 35:13.160]  No, why? I'm just curious.
[35:13.440 --> 35:15.900]  Because it feels like he's just like been tempting you the whole time
[35:15.900 --> 35:17.880]  because you've asked three times to see if he's like a dog.
[35:18.200 --> 35:21.460]  Oh, when he when he when my eyes wander back to him, I wonder.
[35:21.740 --> 35:24.420]  And then, you know, do you feel like he's just been there for too long?
[35:24.520 --> 35:26.860]  I'm going to you know, I had to repress my inner Nick
[35:26.860 --> 35:30.300]  when the Home Alone characters walked by saying that that was not a holiday outfit.
[35:30.600 --> 35:33.420]  I really wanted to. Oh, that's interesting.
[35:34.520 --> 35:35.480]  It's a Christmas movie.
[35:36.280 --> 35:38.480]  Yeah. So you got a bingo, right, Nick?
[35:38.860 --> 35:40.200]  I got a bingo on the main card.
[35:40.220 --> 35:42.720]  We'll go for blackout on the bingo card while we're still trying to get a boo.
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.080]  God, I was only one away. I was camera over stare away.
[35:46.080 --> 35:47.740]  I got a minion. Minion.
[35:48.800 --> 35:50.200]  That's the second time they've walked by.
[35:50.780 --> 35:52.980]  So so goofy is not yet overstaying on camera.
[35:54.100 --> 35:57.020]  Not yet. You don't think that's what I was trying to.
[35:57.140 --> 35:59.760]  That's what I was trying to squeeze out of Nick for him to say, like, yeah,
[35:59.760 --> 36:01.720]  I want him out of here. And he didn't say it.
[36:01.840 --> 36:04.120]  No. Oh, he's smoking a cigarette. It's cool.
[36:05.580 --> 36:08.100]  As Max does. He's got a he's got a couple of minutes.
[36:11.160 --> 36:15.100]  Shocked by the lack of fishnets and thick blood.
[36:15.100 --> 36:17.740]  I'm shocked by the lack of body paint costumes.
[36:18.180 --> 36:22.900]  Yeah, I definitely this is not the way I anticipated this going tonight, for sure.
[36:25.240 --> 36:28.980]  On the one hand, I'm a little glad because I've got my finger
[36:28.980 --> 36:33.140]  sitting on this button like you had it ready to go. Smart.
[36:35.220 --> 36:36.940]  Is that the fastest bingo?
[36:37.340 --> 36:38.840]  Almost certainly offensive.
[36:39.520 --> 36:41.760]  Yeah. Is this is that the fastest bingo we've ever had?
[36:42.300 --> 36:42.980]  It was pretty quick.
[36:43.600 --> 36:44.580]  We've been humming along.
[36:45.060 --> 36:46.520]  It's like 15, 20 minutes for that.
[36:47.320 --> 36:50.120]  Wow. I think so, then.
[36:51.820 --> 36:53.980]  And it'll never happen again for me.
[36:57.360 --> 36:58.960]  That cape blowing in the wind.
[36:59.320 --> 37:01.660]  Is that Ruby? Yeah, it did.
[37:02.260 --> 37:04.300]  Where? It's the queen of hearts.
[37:06.380 --> 37:07.760]  Very similar characters.
[37:10.140 --> 37:11.380]  Just look kind of like it.
[37:12.060 --> 37:13.600]  It did, actually, from far away.
[37:13.800 --> 37:14.260]  I'm not crazy.
[37:14.700 --> 37:15.740]  Yeah, no, you're not crazy.
[37:15.900 --> 37:18.420]  I just yeah, it looked like it from far away.
[37:18.580 --> 37:19.640]  That guy was Elvis, you know?
[37:20.060 --> 37:22.180]  I just love Ruby screaming off with it.
[37:22.920 --> 37:24.100]  Hey, that guy was Elvis.
[37:25.480 --> 37:26.500]  OK, a clip of it.
[37:27.800 --> 37:29.020]  I don't know how to do that.
[37:29.340 --> 37:31.160]  Yeah. Oh, that's a shame.
[37:32.540 --> 37:33.700]  Oh, damn. He left.
[37:34.100 --> 37:35.860]  Yeah, figure out how to fix the situation.
[37:36.080 --> 37:38.980]  Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, where, where, where, where?
[37:38.980 --> 37:39.460]  Across the street.
[37:40.560 --> 37:41.720]  OK, that's Elvis.
[37:42.160 --> 37:43.040]  That's Elvis.
[37:43.240 --> 37:43.920]  I think that's Elvis.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.380]  That's Elvis.
[37:45.680 --> 37:47.540]  Real life dead guy. It's the same one, too, I think.
[37:48.640 --> 37:50.180]  And celebrity lookalike, I assume.
[37:51.120 --> 37:51.780]  Yeah, that counts.
[37:54.760 --> 37:55.760]  Oh, finally.
[37:57.100 --> 37:58.120]  Oh, American flag clothes.
[37:58.180 --> 37:59.360]  Just saw those. That's good.
[38:07.640 --> 38:09.540]  Hugh Hefner timely costume.
[38:09.680 --> 38:10.140]  There's Hefner.
[38:12.100 --> 38:13.380]  That's a real life dead guy.
[38:13.380 --> 38:17.480]  It is. Yeah, that is a great, great real life dead guy.
[38:18.460 --> 38:19.980]  Wow, this is a fucking Zorro.
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.320]  Lady, we already got a devil. We don't need you.
[38:23.600 --> 38:24.540]  Yeah, get out of here.
[38:25.840 --> 38:26.640]  Oh, it's Dan.
[38:26.980 --> 38:27.720]  Oh, there's Dan again.
[38:27.860 --> 38:29.560]  And there's Andrew's face.
[38:29.860 --> 38:30.700]  Andrew, there's your face.
[38:30.880 --> 38:31.840]  There's your fucking face.
[38:31.960 --> 38:33.360]  That counts, man.
[38:33.920 --> 38:34.800]  Have some peanut butter.
[38:35.660 --> 38:36.840]  Oh, there's bingo cards.
[38:38.580 --> 38:39.980]  Does he know he's a meme yet?
[38:40.680 --> 38:42.480]  He must. He must.
[38:43.500 --> 38:45.280]  I need to see some gerbil clothing.
[38:45.380 --> 38:46.180]  Oh, what do we got?
[38:46.340 --> 38:48.240]  We got a... He's opening bingo cards for us.
[38:49.020 --> 38:49.360]  Do you want a rip?
[38:50.440 --> 38:51.660]  He's doing a rip.
[38:52.060 --> 38:53.180]  Is that like a deer's face?
[38:55.680 --> 38:57.500]  Oh, you can't see any of them.
[38:57.540 --> 38:58.360]  You can't fucking tell that.
[38:58.540 --> 38:59.480]  What was that, a polar bear?
[39:00.320 --> 39:02.380]  You know, the best part about this is...
[39:02.380 --> 39:03.620]  Oh, there he goes, fucking hat.
[39:04.700 --> 39:07.140]  There's a bouncer going, what the fuck is he doing?
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.100]  What was that one, a fuck?
[39:10.400 --> 39:11.320]  Max is entertained.
[39:11.500 --> 39:12.180]  A bag of dogs?
[39:12.180 --> 39:14.260]  You know what, some graveyards tour.
[39:14.800 --> 39:15.260]  Everybody has that.
[39:15.320 --> 39:15.960]  What are you looking at, nerd?
[39:16.080 --> 39:16.840]  Oh, ghosts and graveyards.
[39:16.860 --> 39:18.580]  Dude, this is so funny.
[39:18.840 --> 39:20.460]  This is genuinely like...
[39:20.460 --> 39:21.780]  I really love this bit.
[39:22.100 --> 39:24.000]  This is a very funny bit.
[39:24.380 --> 39:25.660]  Oh, now he's giving away cards.
[39:26.500 --> 39:27.620]  Yeah, he's giving them away.
[39:28.240 --> 39:29.140]  Live rip.
[39:30.320 --> 39:31.280]  Oh my god.
[39:31.640 --> 39:32.400]  That was amazing.
[39:32.680 --> 39:34.320]  That was a very funny bit.
[39:34.420 --> 39:37.520]  They're gonna see the sloppy Drew shirt and fucking sue us.
[39:38.140 --> 39:41.660]  That guy is probably wondering why the shirt is nothing to do with the establishment.
[39:42.320 --> 39:45.640]  Hey Eric, this guy in the black hat is dressed as Geoff the Drunk.
[39:46.740 --> 39:49.340]  Right? It's fucking perfect.
[39:49.520 --> 39:50.040]  That's pretty good.
[39:50.380 --> 39:51.100]  That's pretty good.
[39:55.680 --> 40:01.360]  Do you guys think we will ever go as a group to Key West again?
[40:02.520 --> 40:02.880]  Yes.
[40:03.520 --> 40:03.860]  Oh!
[40:04.040 --> 40:04.420]  Wow.
[40:04.600 --> 40:05.880]  I would go again.
[40:06.600 --> 40:06.940]  It was a good trip.
[40:06.940 --> 40:09.100]  I mean, I think we all would go again, but will we?
[40:09.160 --> 40:10.540]  I think that's the question.
[40:11.220 --> 40:11.880]  I wonder.
[40:12.540 --> 40:13.400]  I don't see why not.
[40:13.560 --> 40:14.820]  Alright, there you go.
[40:22.290 --> 40:23.770]  That's a beach goth.
[40:24.750 --> 40:26.070]  Oh yeah, beach goth, yep.
[40:27.730 --> 40:29.410]  Oh, I don't have it of course.
[40:30.210 --> 40:31.470]  That would be too easy.
[40:34.050 --> 40:35.510]  I feel like new boot goofing.
[40:36.010 --> 40:37.830]  I think I have that too.
[40:38.690 --> 40:40.930]  Hey, does that pumpkin shirt count as pumpkin outfit?
[40:41.430 --> 40:41.670]  Yeah.
[40:41.890 --> 40:43.910]  Yeah, it's pumpkin attire.
[40:43.910 --> 40:45.130]  That's a bingo.
[40:46.130 --> 40:46.570]  Congratulations.
[40:47.250 --> 40:49.610]  Did you get the boo board bingo also? Way to go, man.
[40:49.730 --> 40:50.690]  I did.
[40:50.910 --> 40:51.810]  Two cakes?
[40:52.270 --> 40:53.850]  You can put your small cake on your big cake.
[40:54.410 --> 40:54.730]  Oh shit.
[40:55.030 --> 40:56.970]  Turd, are you the scream guy?
[40:57.550 --> 40:57.990]  Turd!
[40:59.070 --> 40:59.510]  Turd!
[41:00.230 --> 41:02.090]  That looks like the scream guy.
[41:03.210 --> 41:04.610]  That's Kyle's ass from Tenacious D.
[41:06.570 --> 41:07.590]  Is that a pawpaw?
[41:09.050 --> 41:09.290]  Where?
[41:09.790 --> 41:10.230]  No.
[41:10.790 --> 41:11.310]  That old guy?
[41:12.190 --> 41:13.470]  Nah, he's not hunched enough.
[41:14.190 --> 41:14.910]  More hunchage?
[41:16.310 --> 41:19.190]  Yeah, still, that guy had a lot of living left in him. Pawpaw doesn't.
[41:21.750 --> 41:22.470]  Jesus Christ.
[41:22.630 --> 41:23.570]  I'm just being honest.
[41:24.390 --> 41:25.810]  Well, fair, you know, I guess.
[41:26.570 --> 41:32.410]  He's had a long life. He's had a fulfilling life. We need to celebrate that and not be sad that he's leaving us soon.
[41:39.120 --> 41:42.860]  Oh man, so should we just try to blank out our boo boards, I guess?
[41:43.320 --> 41:43.540]  Yeah.
[41:43.940 --> 41:44.960]  We haven't been going very long.
[41:45.480 --> 41:46.320]  We need to go.
[41:46.880 --> 41:48.400]  We don't want to rip the audience off.
[41:48.820 --> 41:49.620]  No, absolutely not.
[41:49.620 --> 41:51.800]  Halloween themed car I haven't seen since before we started.
[41:52.120 --> 41:52.800]  I know.
[41:53.240 --> 41:54.960]  Yeah, there was the cum car in the beginning.
[41:55.360 --> 41:55.580]  Yeah.
[41:55.840 --> 41:58.720]  And there was the car that had green ground effects that were flashing.
[42:03.540 --> 42:04.620]  Oh, two little dogs?
[42:06.680 --> 42:07.360]  Are they in costumes?
[42:07.840 --> 42:08.180]  No.
[42:08.320 --> 42:09.380]  No, they're just up there.
[42:09.440 --> 42:09.720]  They're walking across the street.
[42:09.820 --> 42:13.580]  I just need to see, at the same time, a motorcycle. Show me a motorcycle. Yes!
[42:14.020 --> 42:14.780]  Dog and a hog!
[42:15.100 --> 42:15.560]  Dog and a hog!
[42:15.560 --> 42:16.180]  Dog and a hog, wow!
[42:16.600 --> 42:17.360]  That's a hog!
[42:17.900 --> 42:19.280]  That is a great one.
[42:19.340 --> 42:20.000]  Are they in motorcycles or scooters?
[42:21.640 --> 42:22.600]  That's a motorcycle!
[42:24.080 --> 42:25.000]  Yeah, that one's a motorcycle.
[42:25.180 --> 42:25.900]  Yeah, he's right.
[42:26.020 --> 42:26.760]  Those are motorcycles.
[42:27.320 --> 42:28.780]  For all intents and purposes, yeah.
[42:30.860 --> 42:32.380]  But is that motorcycle Elvis?
[42:33.280 --> 42:33.920]  That is the question.
[42:35.860 --> 42:39.380]  A lot of people in chat said it was scooters.
[42:40.900 --> 42:42.560]  Oh, that's fine. We don't listen to the chat.
[42:42.980 --> 42:43.260]  Yeah.
[42:43.400 --> 42:43.760]  Yeah, remember?
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.820]  You must have just got here.
[42:47.780 --> 42:49.380]  You must be new here.
[42:52.140 --> 42:54.220]  I think there's a lot of truth in the chat.
[42:54.560 --> 42:55.620]  I totally agree.
[42:56.420 --> 42:56.860]  Yeah.
[42:57.320 --> 42:59.020]  I'm not worried about that.
[43:00.440 --> 43:02.260]  The cones are back. Have they outstayed their welcome?
[43:03.020 --> 43:06.400]  I'm telling you, that one cone, there's no way he can sit down.
[43:06.420 --> 43:09.240]  They have passed by, they have walked by three plus times.
[43:09.660 --> 43:11.340]  They've multiplied. There's more cones.
[43:11.940 --> 43:13.480]  Yeah, there were a lot over there.
[43:13.960 --> 43:14.580]  Look, Andrew!
[43:14.580 --> 43:15.400]  What?
[43:16.720 --> 43:17.900]  Santa! Santa!
[43:19.100 --> 43:21.600]  That's a boo for me.
[43:22.820 --> 43:27.240]  I'm telling you, that guy in the biggest cone, there's no way he can sit down.
[43:27.320 --> 43:28.260]  That's impractical.
[43:28.620 --> 43:31.760]  He's about to cross the street. I'm marking it. It's impossible.
[43:32.180 --> 43:33.280]  He just has to pull it up.
[43:33.540 --> 43:34.980]  No, that's ridiculous.
[43:35.800 --> 43:36.540]  I think he can totally sit down.
[43:37.080 --> 43:38.840]  The other guys absolutely can sit down.
[43:38.940 --> 43:43.480]  The guy where it goes to his ankles, the guy that's demure, he can't sit down.
[43:43.480 --> 43:45.740]  You could pop that over a chair to be fine.
[43:45.760 --> 43:46.880]  I'm gonna pop you over a chair.
[43:49.860 --> 43:50.260]  Nonsense.
[43:50.740 --> 43:53.040]  You can ask the chat if you want to.
[43:53.220 --> 43:54.760]  Ask the chat. They'll agree.
[43:55.520 --> 43:56.600]  Yeah, I know they will.
[43:57.740 --> 43:58.680]  That guy dropped something.
[43:58.800 --> 43:59.300]  Oh, he dropped something.
[43:59.680 --> 44:00.220]  Yeah, he did.
[44:00.900 --> 44:03.760]  Oh, he's like, I'm a drunk guy. He's like doing a bit.
[44:04.940 --> 44:06.080]  And she's filming it.
[44:06.240 --> 44:06.400]  She's filming it.
[44:06.420 --> 44:07.860]  He's so funny and clever.
[44:08.500 --> 44:08.720]  Yep.
[44:10.380 --> 44:11.380]  Oh, who's this guy?
[44:11.380 --> 44:14.940]  I think he's just dressed like an asshole.
[44:15.300 --> 44:16.100]  Yeah, I think so.
[44:16.100 --> 44:19.040]  He looks like he dresses the bar from Saved by the Bell.
[44:23.760 --> 44:26.500]  Oh, they were unamused by that guy's antics too.
[44:29.700 --> 44:30.220]  Hey!
[44:31.580 --> 44:32.700]  There he is.
[44:33.200 --> 44:33.720]  Okay.
[44:36.380 --> 44:38.060]  That's for when he falls down later.
[44:38.320 --> 44:39.520]  Oh, damn it.
[44:40.720 --> 44:41.240]  What?
[44:41.820 --> 44:44.740]  Something that I thought it was something different, but it wasn't that thing.
[44:44.980 --> 44:45.640]  No, it's not.
[44:46.380 --> 44:47.140]  That's right, party.
[44:50.100 --> 44:50.420]  Cop!
[44:50.480 --> 44:51.300]  Something that I thought it was different.
[44:51.300 --> 44:51.940]  Cop on the street.
[44:52.220 --> 44:53.120]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[44:55.220 --> 44:55.760]  Where's the cop?
[44:57.300 --> 44:58.520]  On the street, right there.
[44:58.980 --> 44:59.620]  At the bottom right.
[44:59.980 --> 45:05.470]  What is this guy supposed to be?
[45:07.470 --> 45:09.630]  Like with his hat? He has like an outfit.
[45:10.510 --> 45:11.550]  What is that?
[45:13.150 --> 45:14.030]  He's a...
[45:14.030 --> 45:14.770]  Oh, he's that thing!
[45:15.130 --> 45:16.530]  He's that bottle that he's holding.
[45:16.850 --> 45:17.110]  Oh.
[45:17.170 --> 45:17.530]  Oh!
[45:17.910 --> 45:18.510]  He's like a...
[45:19.030 --> 45:19.890]  I think the outfit...
[45:19.890 --> 45:20.870]  He's like a pepper shaker?
[45:22.350 --> 45:24.130]  No, he's like a big bottle of...
[45:24.130 --> 45:28.630]  I think his clothes is the outfit and the bowl is so the government can't read his thoughts.
[45:28.770 --> 45:30.450]  I think they're two separate things.
[45:31.850 --> 45:33.650]  I didn't know Alex Jones moved to Florida.
[45:34.350 --> 45:34.930]  As a referee.
[45:40.280 --> 45:42.560]  Nobody's eating candy at the street crossing.
[45:42.680 --> 45:43.200]  It's little scissors.
[45:43.940 --> 45:44.760]  Referee suit.
[45:46.080 --> 45:46.600]  He's...
[45:46.600 --> 45:47.800]  Oh, there's a Roman.
[45:47.800 --> 45:49.000]  That's pizza right there.
[45:50.980 --> 45:53.960]  He's clase azul reposado.
[45:54.560 --> 45:55.140]  I think.
[45:55.660 --> 45:56.540]  He's tequila.
[45:56.660 --> 45:57.360]  He's a tequila boss.
[45:57.860 --> 46:00.460]  Isn't that the bottle that Gracie thought was an urn?
[46:00.600 --> 46:01.200]  I think so.
[46:01.880 --> 46:02.040]  Yeah.
[46:13.760 --> 46:16.600]  That dude looks pretty dressed up for being on a scooter.
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.120]  Yeah, that looks like formal attire on a moped.
[46:20.800 --> 46:22.140]  Yeah, it is. Absolutely.
[46:23.240 --> 46:23.980]  Wow.
[46:24.980 --> 46:27.340]  Dog wearing costume, a hot dog costume.
[46:28.440 --> 46:30.340]  There's pizza costume.
[46:30.780 --> 46:31.320]  Pizza guy.
[46:35.060 --> 46:37.820]  Napoleon Dynamite. Everyone's favorite.
[46:39.560 --> 46:40.400]  Timely.
[46:42.660 --> 46:45.100]  And also good. Everybody loves.
[46:48.120 --> 46:49.380]  What's the name of that show?
[46:50.380 --> 46:52.500]  That we hated on Napoleon Dynamite for 30 minutes.
[46:54.140 --> 46:55.040]  Who are you?
[46:55.360 --> 46:55.860]  Who are you?
[46:57.880 --> 46:59.020]  I was like, it was a movie.
[46:59.980 --> 47:01.100]  It also was a show.
[47:03.160 --> 47:04.260]  What? For real?
[47:04.420 --> 47:06.840]  Yeah, they did a Fox animated Napoleon Dynamite show.
[47:07.240 --> 47:08.740]  It did not last longer than a season.
[47:09.300 --> 47:09.640]  God.
[47:12.470 --> 47:13.690]  That makes me even angrier.
[47:14.650 --> 47:17.170]  It was relatively recent, too.
[47:17.370 --> 47:18.290]  Oh, get out of the car.
[47:21.510 --> 47:25.510]  I like describing mundane activities as if they're a bingo board thing.
[47:25.610 --> 47:27.310]  There's Scream. Scream masks over there.
[47:27.310 --> 47:31.930]  Do you think that guy is a Yankees fan or a fan of New York?
[47:33.730 --> 47:34.250]  Neither.
[47:36.490 --> 47:37.070]  He's a tourist.
[47:42.630 --> 47:43.730]  Where are the fishnets?
[47:45.790 --> 47:47.490]  Where's the hot dog costume?
[47:48.950 --> 47:49.850]  We've had pizza.
[47:50.590 --> 47:51.950]  Oh, is that Deadpool shorts?
[47:54.230 --> 47:56.770]  I think she's supposed to be like Harley Quinn or something.
[47:57.910 --> 47:59.010]  That checks out.
[47:59.190 --> 48:01.590]  I just took a break to watch the guys do the handshake again.
[48:01.690 --> 48:02.470]  It made me laugh.
[48:05.510 --> 48:06.530]  It's so funny.
[48:06.790 --> 48:07.910]  It's so funny.
[48:08.210 --> 48:10.150]  I can't wait to zoom in on it and slow it down.
[48:10.390 --> 48:12.190]  It's so... Gavin, it's so...
[48:12.190 --> 48:14.630]  Make sure you put it in the...
[48:14.630 --> 48:17.030]  There's like 3,000 people watching this nonsense.
[48:17.030 --> 48:18.470]  Pick it up, Florida.
[48:20.230 --> 48:22.770]  Sloppy Joe's not very sloppy tonight on Halloween, guys.
[48:24.330 --> 48:26.710]  I think it may have been sloppier earlier.
[48:27.070 --> 48:29.150]  Yeah, it was so sloppy earlier.
[48:29.590 --> 48:30.030]  Crazy.
[48:30.310 --> 48:32.310]  It like de-slopped. Maybe people started at lunch.
[48:33.390 --> 48:38.490]  We don't want to do it this late in the game, but in the future we can always just drag the fucking bar back.
[48:38.670 --> 48:39.690]  It goes back 12 hours.
[48:40.850 --> 48:41.810]  Oh, that's true.
[48:43.950 --> 48:45.130]  Oh, they're back!
[48:45.230 --> 48:45.870]  They did it!
[48:45.870 --> 48:46.850]  High five!
[48:50.250 --> 48:51.810]  That's Heisenberg, maybe.
[48:52.970 --> 48:54.930]  Probably not. Sweet stache, though. I have that.
[48:55.850 --> 48:58.830]  That's so funny. They made up for it. That's so funny.
[48:59.530 --> 49:00.710]  Dan is MVP tonight.
[49:01.090 --> 49:01.370]  Yeah.
[49:03.170 --> 49:04.350]  First time in his life.
[49:11.830 --> 49:13.530]  Nick really liked that.
[49:13.930 --> 49:14.570]  It was funny.
[49:17.550 --> 49:19.950]  This guy just looks like he wants to fight.
[49:20.850 --> 49:21.650]  Which guy?
[49:22.050 --> 49:22.610]  Oh, skeletons.
[49:23.170 --> 49:24.250]  He looks like a player.
[49:24.490 --> 49:24.890]  Hug, hug.
[49:24.930 --> 49:27.230]  Oh my, what are you doing here?
[49:27.830 --> 49:29.690]  That's crazy. You're here?
[49:29.990 --> 49:31.010]  I do have hug.
[49:31.530 --> 49:32.130]  There you go.
[49:33.250 --> 49:33.810]  Sweet.
[49:34.410 --> 49:35.010]  I got fireworks.
[49:37.130 --> 49:38.570]  There's happy Gilmore.
[49:38.670 --> 49:39.150]  Happy Gilmore.
[49:43.190 --> 49:45.230]  Why doesn't anybody fall?
[49:46.610 --> 49:47.170]  Can everybody fall?
[49:47.170 --> 49:47.870]  They do, do they?
[49:53.100 --> 49:55.940]  We got a fucking guy dressed as an urn before we get fake blood.
[49:56.920 --> 50:01.600]  We got a guy dressed as an urn before we get a body paint costume in fucking Key West.
[50:04.660 --> 50:06.900]  This guy has overstayed his welcome.
[50:08.500 --> 50:09.480]  I'm saying it.
[50:09.780 --> 50:10.540]  Camera is landing.
[50:10.940 --> 50:11.620]  Yeah, big time.
[50:11.740 --> 50:12.580]  Yeah, overstay. I agree.
[50:12.840 --> 50:13.600]  Alright, I'm putting it.
[50:13.880 --> 50:14.800]  Alright, mark it.
[50:15.420 --> 50:18.180]  He definitely twerked if anybody's got that.
[50:18.200 --> 50:19.100]  Does that count as dancing?
[50:20.400 --> 50:21.660]  Yeah, dancing and twerking.
[50:21.660 --> 50:22.420]  I'd give it to you, yeah.
[50:22.940 --> 50:23.620]  Sure, why not?
[50:23.900 --> 50:24.560]  American flag clothes.
[50:26.200 --> 50:27.360]  Sunglasses at night.
[50:28.800 --> 50:30.560]  Not seen someone get spooked yet.
[50:30.860 --> 50:31.020]  Chug!
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.580]  He chugged it.
[50:33.500 --> 50:39.200]  There's a level of desperation where you have to hold the thing you're dressed as to illustrate what you're dressed as.
[50:39.260 --> 50:39.820]  Yep, I'm this.
[50:40.660 --> 50:40.960]  Yeah.
[50:44.040 --> 50:45.040]  Obviously dyed hair.
[50:45.240 --> 50:46.560]  I really like this thing I'm holding.
[50:48.040 --> 50:48.820]  Can you tell?
[50:50.200 --> 50:51.540]  I'm just gonna stand here.
[50:51.640 --> 50:52.700]  You can take a picture with me.
[50:52.860 --> 50:57.120]  If he tripped and that helmet fell off, that little bulb.
[50:58.400 --> 51:00.220]  Fucking clanging down the street.
[51:03.160 --> 51:04.880]  It's run over by a car.
[51:06.440 --> 51:08.280]  This is a bachelorette party, yes?
[51:08.480 --> 51:09.960]  Yeah, bachelorette party for sure.
[51:10.240 --> 51:10.620]  Thank you.
[51:14.960 --> 51:17.240]  I see somebody almost get hit by a car.
[51:19.220 --> 51:19.940]  Me too.
[51:24.400 --> 51:25.920]  I'm pretty sure everything has been dropped.
[51:25.940 --> 51:30.240]  I don't want it to happen, but somebody getting hit by a car and Nick fucking pivoting to puppies.
[51:30.740 --> 51:33.900]  Oh no!
[51:38.120 --> 51:39.820]  The Super J card.
[51:41.720 --> 51:42.540]  Super J.
[51:49.520 --> 51:50.840]  I ain't afraid.
[51:51.920 --> 51:53.480]  I'm not sure what she's not afraid of.
[51:53.720 --> 51:54.860]  Nice beard, dude.
[51:55.320 --> 51:57.620]  That is purely neck, that beard.
[51:57.720 --> 51:58.020]  Yeah.
[52:04.060 --> 52:05.880]  I can't believe we didn't see... sweet stash.
[52:06.540 --> 52:09.720]  I can't believe we didn't see a single penis costume.
[52:10.180 --> 52:12.160]  I'm like, I'm absolutely floored.
[52:13.300 --> 52:14.480]  Well, it's not 11 yet.
[52:15.280 --> 52:16.520]  Yeah, it's still pretty early.
[52:16.980 --> 52:18.060]  It's at the weird time.
[52:20.040 --> 52:22.880]  Everybody showed up for like a parade or something earlier probably.
[52:23.260 --> 52:27.100]  Although there's not any stanchions piled up, so I guess there was a lot.
[52:36.770 --> 52:37.930]  Oh, is that guy waiting up?
[52:38.910 --> 52:39.410]  He yells to wait up?
[52:39.410 --> 52:40.530]  Yeah, he yelled to wait up.
[52:41.230 --> 52:42.270]  As I wait up, yep.
[52:42.890 --> 52:44.650]  Now I just need new boot goofing.
[52:45.010 --> 52:45.110]  Damn.
[52:45.950 --> 52:47.650]  For what? And you're blacked out?
[52:48.170 --> 52:48.410]  No.
[52:52.770 --> 52:55.350]  I need 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
[52:56.710 --> 52:57.790]  14 to black out.
[52:58.230 --> 52:59.810]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5...
[52:59.810 --> 53:02.730]  It used to take me about 22, 23 shots to black out.
[53:03.950 --> 53:05.710]  That lady's got a pumpkin purse.
[53:05.890 --> 53:06.850]  Anybody still looking for that?
[53:08.690 --> 53:09.510]  I got pumpkin.
[53:10.030 --> 53:10.850]  Thank you, though.
[53:13.690 --> 53:14.750]  What's his shirt say?
[53:15.830 --> 53:16.710]  Something BAM.
[53:17.330 --> 53:19.250]  We've already seen offensive shirt, I think.
[53:19.570 --> 53:20.370]  Yeah, I think so too.
[53:20.870 --> 53:21.610]  Oh, I missed it.
[53:22.130 --> 53:28.750]  Yeah, it was earlier where a guy's like, free candy with like a big arrow pointing down that said like, keep digging.
[53:29.490 --> 53:30.330]  Alright, man.
[53:31.130 --> 53:32.370]  What's happening over here?
[53:32.870 --> 53:34.190]  Oh, this guy's having a good night.
[53:34.510 --> 53:37.330]  I don't know, but if he fucking falls, I will be so happy.
[53:42.060 --> 53:42.580]  Whoa.
[53:42.720 --> 53:43.080]  Screaming?
[53:44.540 --> 53:44.920]  Fun.
[53:47.340 --> 53:49.680]  Look at those heels just across the street.
[53:50.620 --> 53:51.840]  Is that new boot goofing?
[53:52.140 --> 53:54.900]  That is new boot goofing right there, dude.
[53:55.700 --> 53:56.400]  Got a little bingo.
[53:57.920 --> 53:58.920]  Very nice.
[54:00.420 --> 54:01.620]  I scared him.
[54:01.820 --> 54:02.440]  Wait, the scream!
[54:02.720 --> 54:05.080]  Wait, that was the scream mask on her shirt.
[54:05.360 --> 54:05.620]  Where?
[54:06.080 --> 54:06.600]  Where?
[54:07.120 --> 54:08.380]  Back up, lady!
[54:08.920 --> 54:09.440]  I didn't see it.
[54:09.440 --> 54:11.260]  I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.
[54:11.260 --> 54:12.540]  I saw it, I saw it.
[54:13.240 --> 54:13.980]  He's right.
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.040]  Andrew, are you eating ice cream?
[54:17.540 --> 54:19.980]  Add a little slice of pizza real quick.
[54:20.220 --> 54:20.480]  Okay.
[54:21.580 --> 54:22.480]  Must be nice.
[54:22.660 --> 54:23.720]  Must be fucking nice.
[54:26.900 --> 54:27.940]  That's a boo for me.
[54:28.360 --> 54:29.040]  I got an ooh.
[54:34.890 --> 54:36.510]  I don't think I'm getting the boo.
[54:36.630 --> 54:41.250]  I can't get cosplayer high quality costume or inflatable costume.
[54:42.370 --> 54:44.470]  Yeah, the lack of inflatable really shocks me.
[54:44.470 --> 54:47.430]  I'm telling you, a penis costume, no inflatable, it's crazy.
[54:47.650 --> 54:49.590]  No one's the big T-Rex, that's nuts.
[54:49.590 --> 54:51.950]  Right, you'd think the T-Rex and a penis would be everywhere.
[54:52.850 --> 54:54.570]  And a huge lack of Wolverines.
[54:55.070 --> 54:55.830]  Yeah, big time, man.
[54:55.830 --> 54:56.010]  Yeah, none.
[54:56.330 --> 54:56.870]  And Deadpools, for that matter.
[54:56.870 --> 54:57.650]  I can't believe Deadpool.
[54:58.110 --> 54:59.330]  Or costume dogs.
[54:59.410 --> 55:00.230]  That dog's got no costume.
[55:00.350 --> 55:02.070]  He's out too late, but he does have a costume on.
[55:02.190 --> 55:03.430]  Yeah, it's just a normal dog.
[55:04.130 --> 55:04.690]  Out too late.
[55:04.750 --> 55:06.450]  That guy's got jeans and flip flops on.
[55:07.090 --> 55:07.310]  Yeah.
[55:07.430 --> 55:08.150]  Oh, he sure does.
[55:08.150 --> 55:13.270]  I'm trying to open another tab to see if I can find the camera in the bar still to get
[55:13.270 --> 55:14.810]  a read on who's going to walk out.
[55:15.070 --> 55:15.650]  Oh, that's smart.
[55:17.890 --> 55:19.830]  That seems like insider trading to me.
[55:20.710 --> 55:22.030]  Well, it doesn't help me at all.
[55:22.190 --> 55:23.570]  It's just knowing what's inside.
[55:24.510 --> 55:27.230]  Yeah, so when you see them walk towards the exit, you can...
[55:27.230 --> 55:28.090]  Oh, look, guys!
[55:28.450 --> 55:29.310]  Oh, yeah, that's a good point.
[55:29.790 --> 55:30.370]  What do you mean?
[55:30.450 --> 55:31.470]  No, it's a terrible point.
[55:31.490 --> 55:31.870]  What do you mean?
[55:32.170 --> 55:33.190]  He's also...
[55:33.190 --> 55:34.010]  He's also...
[55:34.010 --> 55:37.130]  We all also have access to the same fucking camera he's about to look at.
[55:37.190 --> 55:37.790]  You can all do it.
[55:37.990 --> 55:38.950]  I can't look at that.
[55:39.390 --> 55:40.830]  You know what I'm doing right now.
[55:41.070 --> 55:44.730]  Put a fucking hat on the dog or something.
[55:45.670 --> 55:46.970]  Jesus, bow tie!
[55:48.230 --> 55:51.950]  That truck had, I just realized, purple and green lights flashing underneath.
[55:52.110 --> 55:53.990]  Yeah, that's how we call it out in time.
[55:54.830 --> 55:56.210]  Does that count as Halloween-themed lights?
[55:57.010 --> 55:58.730]  Yes, that would count as Halloween-themed lights.
[55:59.190 --> 56:00.390]  I think Nick is making it up.
[56:00.670 --> 56:02.810]  I don't think it counts as Gurple clothing, though.
[56:03.050 --> 56:04.190]  Oh, the sticky bandits are out?
[56:05.510 --> 56:08.170]  But it counts as Halloween-themed car lights, which is what I need.
[56:08.250 --> 56:08.750]  Yes, it does.
[56:08.750 --> 56:10.570]  And I need Halloween-themed cars, so I'm doing it.
[56:11.230 --> 56:13.350]  Put some fucking purple shorts on his head.
[56:13.690 --> 56:14.090]  Ghost bus!
[56:15.150 --> 56:15.850]  You know what, Gavin?
[56:17.790 --> 56:19.290]  Handshake. Good job. Good deal.
[56:19.510 --> 56:19.810]  Hell yeah.
[56:20.550 --> 56:20.990]  Ratatouille!
[56:22.370 --> 56:23.590]  That's a Ratatouille!
[56:23.790 --> 56:25.250]  Oh, that's a great costume.
[56:25.550 --> 56:26.030]  And Elvis!
[56:26.430 --> 56:26.710]  Elvis!
[56:30.390 --> 56:30.830]  Oh...
[56:36.750 --> 56:38.450]  I don't think anyone's going to trip tonight.
[56:39.330 --> 56:41.290]  Everybody seems so sure-footed.
[56:42.590 --> 56:46.050]  The guy in the robe at the top, I think, has a chance of tripping.
[56:46.050 --> 56:47.690]  Look at the way the robe is around his leg.
[56:47.770 --> 56:49.810]  Also, I think he might be a flasher, so we should be careful.
[56:53.570 --> 56:54.330]  Trip. Trip.
[56:55.530 --> 56:58.150]  I was really thinking that guy was going to have a peanut butter jar.
[56:58.990 --> 56:59.230]  Tail.
[57:01.250 --> 57:04.690]  Man, people have got to stop trying to rock top hats. It's over.
[57:09.670 --> 57:10.950]  Is that trying to get in the wrong car?
[57:11.210 --> 57:12.150]  Trying to get in the wrong car!
[57:12.530 --> 57:12.970]  Trying to get in the wrong car!
[57:13.930 --> 57:14.150]  Yeah!
[57:14.150 --> 57:14.530]  Yeah!
[57:16.310 --> 57:20.550]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Seven's left. I only need seven.
[57:22.550 --> 57:27.290]  Somebody get separated at the crosswalk while sucking on a chili dog and then calling home about the camera while wearing a fanny pack.
[57:28.150 --> 57:30.530]  Oh, I need a fanny pack as well. I need to be looking for that.
[57:31.770 --> 57:33.710]  Does that purse count as a fanny pack?
[57:34.250 --> 57:35.250]  Do you think it does?
[57:37.130 --> 57:38.690]  Do you want me to help you?
[57:39.190 --> 57:40.850]  No! I want to win, Nick.
[57:41.210 --> 57:42.770]  I want to win honestly.
[57:43.570 --> 57:45.110]  This woman's a bit stumbly.
[57:45.350 --> 57:46.270]  Yeah, she is.
[57:46.490 --> 57:47.130]  Good. Take a spill.
[57:49.470 --> 57:51.210]  She made it.
[57:58.530 --> 58:02.490]  I would go back to Key West. Like, no hesitation. I'd go back to Key West.
[58:03.730 --> 58:05.430]  Well, maybe we should do it at some point.
[58:08.250 --> 58:09.390]  Oh, it's Satan.
[58:12.030 --> 58:13.110]  Big S himself.
[58:14.430 --> 58:15.310]  Big S.
[58:17.150 --> 58:21.010]  That's a cool costume and all, Satan. But what if you were a hot dog instead?
[58:23.590 --> 58:24.390]  Not a fanny pack.
[58:25.090 --> 58:26.270]  You don't think that was a fanny pack?
[58:26.710 --> 58:27.730]  Oh, the one in the white?
[58:27.830 --> 58:28.970]  On the lady in white.
[58:29.630 --> 58:30.630]  Yeah, that's a fanny pack.
[58:32.550 --> 58:33.630]  Yeah, that's a fanny pack.
[58:33.650 --> 58:36.150]  Now go around the corner and suck on a chili dog and almost get hit by a car.
[58:38.890 --> 58:39.690]  That's a dickhead truck.
[58:40.530 --> 58:42.130]  That is a dickhead truck. We've had a bunch.
[58:43.650 --> 58:44.170]  Dog.
[58:44.610 --> 58:47.810]  What a fucking pair of wings on it.
[58:52.360 --> 58:56.280]  I can't tell if Pitbull's overstayed his welcome or if that's a different Pitbull.
[58:56.340 --> 58:59.100]  No, no, it's the same guy. We keep seeing this one Pitbull.
[58:59.100 --> 58:59.680]  Double fisting.
[59:00.040 --> 59:01.080]  Double fisting?
[59:01.080 --> 59:01.600]  Hell yeah.
[59:02.980 --> 59:06.320]  But I need double fisting buckets of candy. Hey, look, it's Elvis.
[59:08.320 --> 59:09.660]  Hey, he's here.
[59:10.220 --> 59:11.220]  That one could be Elvis.
[59:11.420 --> 59:11.800]  Yeah.
[59:12.700 --> 59:13.800]  Who did he just finger guns?
[59:13.800 --> 59:15.380]  I don't know.
[59:15.640 --> 59:16.400]  Just a guy in a wig?
[59:16.780 --> 59:17.360]  Ratatouille.
[59:18.640 --> 59:19.860]  Ratatouille's a great costume.
[59:20.220 --> 59:21.200]  It's so good.
[59:22.200 --> 59:23.400]  Oh, hell yeah.
[59:23.940 --> 59:24.400]  They're dancing.
[59:25.220 --> 59:28.440]  I don't think he's an actual Elvis impersonator, guys.
[59:29.260 --> 59:30.540]  I think that's Elvis.
[59:32.840 --> 59:34.540]  He might be the guy.
[59:42.500 --> 59:45.040]  It just reminded me of Jack from Haunter.
[59:50.000 --> 59:52.500]  They're having so much fun.
[59:52.600 --> 59:53.060]  I'm so happy for them.
[59:53.060 --> 59:54.280]  They're having a great time.
[59:54.820 --> 59:55.120]  That's adorable.
[59:55.120 --> 59:58.900]  We need to schedule out like three hours one day, Eric, and just finish Ratatouille.
[59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.240]  Just knock it out in a day.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.780]  I agree.
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.400]  And I think it's pretty bold to say it will only take three hours.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.960]  Has everybody guessed it on a Ratatouille yet?
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:07.920]  Not Gavin.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.120]  No, Gavin has not.
[01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.680]  You should really make force Gavin too.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.140]  Make force.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.400]  You really got to make everybody go through it.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.280]  It's brutal.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.760]  Wow, the dancing is still happening.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.800]  They're really having a good time.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.120]  Yeah, I don't like it.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.720]  If the bouncer bounced them, that would be the funniest thing ever.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.520]  Oh my god, that would be amazing.
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.940]  Number 30, I can't tell.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:41.060]  You would think obviously dyed hair would be a thing tonight.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.040]  That's a really bad Elvis wig.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.100]  Yeah, was his hair ever like that?
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.080]  I don't think so.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:48.380]  Maybe when he died.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.680]  Maybe when they found him.
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.320]  Dog.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.540]  Boy, they're just going to do it all fucking night long, aren't they?
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:58.720]  People just trying to walk around them.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:03.320]  There's so much other Duval Street for you guys to annoy.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.540]  He's going apeshit.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.900]  Yeah, but there's not a camera in those corners.
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:07.900]  That's true.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:09.000]  That is true.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.000]  He's going to fool the street.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.240]  Oh, that would be amazing if he did.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.940]  It's just annoying everybody.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.440]  Nobody's amused by it at this point.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.440]  If he falls, I get my fall.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.740]  Fall, fall, fall.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:22.880]  I get my fucking dance.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.000]  Oh, no, he made it.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.100]  The least you can do is fall.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:25.540]  Take a knee.
[01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:25.820]  He made it.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.780]  Take a knee.
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.620]  I think that was a popo.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:31.500]  Where?
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.820]  Yeah, nobody knows what you're talking about.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:39.460]  I think that Elvis was a fucking papa, but I won't count it.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:41.920]  Nah, he was too spry.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:43.420]  American flag clothing.
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:51.220]  Dude, Nick, my friend Emily, who used to work at Rooster Teeth, she was Madam Web for Halloween.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:02:01.180]  She bought the knockoff Gucci sunglasses and she just told me, the day that I tried on the glasses, I had a vision and it came true.
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.220]  I was really hoping they wouldn't go in.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:10.780]  They didn't.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.220]  Just walk on.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.140]  Just keep on walking.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.100]  What are the...
[01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.580]  On the fence about walking.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.960]  Oh, we've had on the fence a few times.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:24.660]  Okay.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.140]  But they're definitely not going to go in.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:28.200]  They're going to keep walking.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:29.980]  Is that guy supposed to be Hitman?
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.460]  I think he's supposed to be the spirit.
[01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.050]  Didn't this guy have a dog?
[01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:40.010]  Oh, he still has a dog.
[01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:40.970]  He's carrying the dog.
[01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.290]  And the dog's fucking exhausted because it's out too late.
[01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:47.470]  And he didn't even put it in a costume so it doesn't get to be festive.
[01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:50.230]  Is this guy in the weed hat a popo?
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.870]  No.
[01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:54.270]  That's close, though.
[01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.670]  He wears a skull t-shirt. He's way too young.
[01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:58.170]  He's out there with his homie.
[01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:01.730]  He likes weed and skulls, dude. Come on.
[01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:07.710]  Is that guy saying that America's a pirate nation?
[01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:11.630]  I don't think it's that deep.
[01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:17.590]  That is drunk walking right there.
[01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.110]  Oh, it sure is.
[01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:21.130]  That was close.
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.130]  He needs some water now.
[01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.570]  If that guy falls hard enough, maybe he can be in a wheelchair.
[01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.770]  Dude, this guy fell early. Look at this boot.
[01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:30.430]  Bandage dude?
[01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:33.270]  Oh, there's bandage. If a man needs it.
[01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:34.730]  Hell yeah, I do.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.300]  My blackout's just never going to happen.
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.180]  Freddy Krueger!
[01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:42.160]  I feel like somebody's going to kill me.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.060]  Sucking on a chili dog never happens.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.540]  Trip is so rare.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:49.220]  Dude, clown car? No shot.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.880]  Sucking on a chili dog happens, I think, usually.
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.180]  I think maybe the guy's not out tonight because it's a holiday.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.840]  Although you'd think he'd be slinging chili dogs even harder.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.840]  Dude, I could go for a chili dog right now.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.900]  I just haven't seen anyone dogging it.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.820]  I have fucking hot dogs and no buns right now.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.920]  Did you see that dog I posted the other day, Geoff?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.760]  I did. It looked good.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.780]  Dude, that was from Mighty Fine.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:16.720]  Was it really?
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:17.820]  Yeah.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.160]  I never think about getting their dog.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.180]  I've never had a...
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.060]  I'd never had it before, but I just had a cheeseburger earlier in the day.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.540]  So I decided to change it up a little.
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.700]  Dude, I'm going to do that.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.780]  I had some from Five Guys the other day that were fucking great.
[01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.180]  I never had the dogs.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.200]  That guy, is he dressed as Lieutenant Dangle?
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.800]  Because if he is, those are the boots from New Boot Goofin, where it came from.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.000]  Yes, he is.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.380]  New Boot Goofin.
[01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:59.170]  How many boots does everybody need?
[01:04:59.290 --> 01:04:59.970]  I need four.
[01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:02.110]  I also need four.
[01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.910]  One, two, three, four, five.
[01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:06.170]  I need five.
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:07.670]  I'm just not getting them.
[01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:14.490]  That is actually pretty incredible, that the actual New Boot Goofin boots came through.
[01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:15.950]  That is pretty wild.
[01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:17.710]  The inspiration for the bit.
[01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:20.910]  That could have been your suggestion if you got it in early enough, Gavin.
[01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:36.520]  I don't think we're getting fallers.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:42.960]  As I said, Geoff, when you picked it, it would be the greatest moment of my life to witness somebody fall in a Halloween costume.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.140]  I just gotta hope for it, man.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.180]  I just gotta hope for it.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.180]  I love the hope.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:52.840]  You figure people start drinking early, their equilibrium's off because they're wearing a weird costume.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.180]  It's a great point.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:57.660]  Is this that guy, again, on the phone?
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:05:59.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:00.660]  Yeah, it is.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:01.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:02.600]  That's Handshake Guy.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.280]  It is Handshake Guy.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.540]  You think he's calling home about the camera?
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.440]  I think that's what he's trying to do.
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.480]  He's like, alright, be honest, how bad was it?
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:19.940]  He's not acknowledging the camera while he's on the phone, which is really making it hard.
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.020]  Did somebody have a fake blood one?
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.400]  I did.
[01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.840]  Did you get it already?
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:25.760]  No.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:28.560]  That lady just walked by with fake blood.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.900]  She was like a vampire lady.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.700]  Yeah, she had fake blood going down her mouth.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.400]  Okay, I'll take it.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:34.620]  Thanks, Geoff.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.500]  You didn't fucking see it.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.740]  No, I missed it.
[01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:37.820]  Yeah, perfect.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.140]  Did we count those dudes in the scary masks as a horror movie costume?
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.680]  Dudes in scary masks?
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:47.880]  Oh, the rug coats?
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:49.640]  I don't think that's a horror movie.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:50.640]  No, not that.
[01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:52.240]  Oh, never mind.
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.480]  The scream mask was a shirt.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.320]  It was, yeah.
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.800]  So it wasn't a costume.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:06:58.600]  Doesn't count for me.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:06:59.940]  How does that not count?
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:01.400]  The thing is scream mask.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.360]  It was on a shirt.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.940]  But it's the mask of scream.
[01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.560]  I mean, if I got Andrew's face from a shirt as well, I feel like...
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.320]  But Nick's is a horror movie costume.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.380]  It's costume specific.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:19.780]  Would you consider Home Alone to be a horror movie? Rain. It's raining.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:20.780]  Is it raining?
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.900]  It just started raining.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.120]  Oh, no.
[01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:24.840]  That's a disaster.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.500]  Oh, that's bad for the body painters.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.280]  That guy's going too fast to hit the rain.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.380]  He's on an e-bike.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.760]  What if we fell right back there?
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.380]  I bet he doesn't know.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:35.600]  I bet he doesn't know how to drive at that point.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:36.560]  Did the rain stop?
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840]  It looks like it.
[01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.000]  It looks like it rained for one second.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.780]  That was crazy.
[01:07:47.290 --> 01:07:48.870]  That's what happened today here.
[01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:53.310]  You talking about crashing a vehicle that gave me the sudden urge to play GTA?
[01:07:53.910 --> 01:07:55.150]  Oh, you guys talking about playing GTA?
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.500]  That fucking game.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.540]  You can boot it up right now.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:04.580]  Did you play more COD or what?
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:05.660]  I did.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.880]  I've been trying to unlock perks and shit, so I've been playing all day.
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:10.320]  Oh, nice.
[01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:10.840]  Hell yeah.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.160]  What level are you?
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:12.940]  16.
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:14.080]  Wow.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:15.260]  Oh, Dan's back.
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:16.560]  Dan's back.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:17.500]  Have peanut butter.
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.420]  He's got a chili dog.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.680]  He's not going to have peanut butter.
[01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:20.620]  He's got a chili dog.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.220]  That son of a bitch!
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:23.840]  He's not eating it yet.
[01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:25.520]  Where's your peanut butter?
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:26.740]  Yes!
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.840]  Yes, pumpkin!
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:29.540]  Yes!
[01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.020]  Suck it on a chili dog.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:31.980]  Hell yeah!
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:33.760]  I need peanut butter!
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.000]  Way to go, Dan.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.200]  Cheers, Dan.
[01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:36.960]  Cheers, Dan.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.920]  Cheers to you, sir.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.820]  Cheers to him, but peanut butter next time.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.220]  Go almost get hit by a car.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:43.780]  No!
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:45.320]  No, don't do that.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:46.100]  Not him.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.020]  Everybody but him.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.160]  He's calling home about the camera.
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:50.040]  Calling home about the camera.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.200]  He's acknowledged the camera.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.360]  He's on the phone.
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.140]  He's calling home about the camera.
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.180]  Oh, man.
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:08:59.620]  Oh, fuck.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:03.100]  I just realized it raining really hurts my sitting on the street.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:03.800]  Yeah.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.880]  Yeah, same.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.440]  Oh, is that a cop?
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.400]  Yeah, that's a cop.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:07.740]  It is.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.260]  Oh, he's hauling.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.640]  I need four for a blackout.
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:13.200]  What if he's after Dan?
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.440]  I need...
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:21.700]  I need almost get hit by a car, clown car, trip, and separate at a crosswalk.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:23.300]  There's just no shot.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.520]  Oh, he almost tripped, but it didn't.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.460]  That was so close.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:27.660]  He's just drunk.
[01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:28.960]  Close, though.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:37.360]  If only it was seasonal Florida for the winter, we could get some ice on the streets in the winter.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.180]  Yeah.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.780]  Really boost the slipping.
[01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:45.700]  Oh, what's Dan cooking up in the background?
[01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:54.430]  Oh, that's girl clothing.
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:57.050]  That's green and purple on that fucking skull.
[01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:58.390]  Where?
[01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:02.850]  That the guy, the old guys that are not people.
[01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:03.990]  The rainbow skull?
[01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:05.030]  Yeah, the rainbow skull.
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:06.270]  You can't call that a rainbow.
[01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.870]  That's green and purple.
[01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:08.030]  It's a rainbow.
[01:10:08.670 --> 01:10:09.450]  That's gurple.
[01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:11.450]  No, come on.
[01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:13.110]  I just need to have those two colors, right?
[01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:13.650]  Geoff.
[01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:14.030]  No.
[01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:17.130]  Geoff, there's a spirit to this.
[01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.990]  Oh, my God.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.980]  Where's the Wolverine?
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:39.260]  Playing Usher.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.040]  Awesome.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.300]  Oh, there's pumpkin.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:48.640]  Sweet.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:49.580]  Pumpkin.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.300]  I've given up on peanut butter, I think.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:56.440]  Oh, yeah?
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.500]  I guess it might be a regional thing.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.380]  Which region?
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.840]  Something like that.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.460]  Maybe Dan will come back with one.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.080]  He's come back with a couple things to help.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:12.480]  Poor Dan's fucking wandering around Key West right now trying to find a store that sells peanut butter at 1030 at night.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.280]  Does this gift shop have peanut butter?
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.360]  Where's the closest place you could get peanut butter from?
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.480]  Sloppy Jess.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.840]  I'm going to look up peanut butter on Google.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.340]  There's a CVS like a block away.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.640]  It's open 24 hours as well.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.440]  They sell tweezers for pulling urchin out of your foot.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:33.600]  It's true, they do.
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.640]  Yeah, they do.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:44.420]  Remember when our captain started waving his arms like fucking crazy in another boat just to say hi?
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.180]  Yeah.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.220]  What are you doing?
[01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:49.640]  We got kicked off a boat because he stole the wrong boat.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.820]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.600]  He stole the wrong boat.
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.440]  Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.020]  Remember when he had a black eye because he fell off the boat the night before?
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:01.800]  Remember all the other stuff that we never talked about on camera?
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.280]  It was the worst.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:07.800]  Do you think the guy in blue is trying to report a crime to that guy?
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.080]  And he's like, I'm just not a cop.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.380]  Ossifer, Ossifer.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.300]  Hot dog costume, please.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.680]  Are those fishnets?
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:27.260]  No.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:27.940]  Oh.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:28.740]  No.
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:29.460]  Or tights.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:29.920]  No.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:30.620]  Those are tights.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:31.420]  Those are not fishnets.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.820]  Yeah, sorry, buddy.
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.720]  Those are not fishnets either.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.600]  Those are jeans.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.600]  Is Geoff good at this?
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.400]  Well, I'm the one that invented it.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:42.980]  What do you want from me?
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.400]  Gavin invented griffball.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:47.780]  That's true.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.980]  Or it's part of the involvement.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:49.680]  That is true.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:53.180]  Oh, tricycle.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:58.020]  That may be the 800th tricycle of the stream.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.680]  I just realized I had it.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:02.240]  The 800th one is the most special.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.460]  I just realized I had it, so...
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:08.720]  Alright, here comes Dan.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.140]  I bet he's got his peanut butter.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:10.520]  Nope.
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.520]  Well, at least he's not a litter bug.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:13.060]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.160]  Somebody just texted you.
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:14.900]  Although I get the peanut butter.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.580]  Although I could have used litter bug.
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:20.000]  He can drop the peanut butter when he's done with hiding.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:21.880]  What is he doing?
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.160]  He's looking for something in his pocket.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.500]  Is the camera shy?
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.160]  I think he might be checking chat.
[01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:28.280]  What's this thing right there?
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.540]  On the corner that he's standing by, Geoff?
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.360]  Oh, there's purple.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.580]  It's like a sunglasses store, isn't it?
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:38.200]  Oh, no, that's where you go and they have like maps and shit for things to do.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.680]  That little kiosk?
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:39.760]  Hey!
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:40.960]  Yeah.
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.700]  That little kiosk thing is like a little maps and whatever thing.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.280]  Where's the CVS?
[01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.250]  Man, oh, that...
[01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:57.450]  It might have mullet.
[01:13:57.450 --> 01:13:59.870]  You can't tell, but it might have a mullet.
[01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:02.650]  This might be my first stream without mullet on my card.
[01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.450]  Yeah, right.
[01:14:04.770 --> 01:14:05.410]  Oh, hold on.
[01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:06.470]  Oh, there's Fred Flintstone.
[01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:11.310]  I don't know why that was so funny to me.
[01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:12.010]  Fred Flintstone.
[01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.930]  What was looking rough, man?
[01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.110]  Fred's looking real rough.
[01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:17.070]  Oh, Fred.
[01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:20.150]  He hasn't got a check from the WB in a while.
[01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:22.690]  Yeah, Barney didn't make it, I'm afraid.
[01:14:24.850 --> 01:14:27.770]  He was really counting on the cameo in that Batgirl movie.
[01:14:33.190 --> 01:14:37.990]  Fred Flintstone losing all his money in crypto feels like a great modern Fred Flintstone thing.
[01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.170]  Yeah, but it only happened after the Jetsons crossover.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.820]  I'm gonna say new boot goofing guy overstaying welcome on the cam.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:51.460]  I'm sick of him.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.800]  Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.400]  There's American Flag clothing again.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:57.920]  Gesticulating wildly.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:58.860]  I wish that was one.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:01.900]  Ooh, we could add it.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:02.540]  Yeah, we could.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.460]  Is she Gatsby lady?
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.260]  Yeah, she's like a flapper.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:06.680]  Yeah.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:09.880]  And she's pissed, maybe?
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:10.060]  Oh, cop car.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.000]  Oh, cop car.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.260]  Nice.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:13.540]  Hell yeah, I've been waiting for that.
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:14.640]  I've got my line across the top.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.660]  I need someone to almost get hit by a car.
[01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.140]  It would be nice.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.380]  Wouldn't it be?
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:22.920]  Oh, selfie.
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:23.400]  Perfect.
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.480]  Hell yeah, I needed that too.
[01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.140]  Wow.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.540]  Oh, that gives me a bingo.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.280]  Not that it matters.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:28.880]  Nice.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.240]  That's still good.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.160]  Bingo's always good.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.320]  Careful, don't trip or do.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.620]  Don't trip unless you do.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:43.060]  Hopefully nobody runs by and launches the people in front of the camera with a shovel.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.640]  That'd be unfortunate.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]  Oh, Fred's back.
[01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:50.220]  Oh, Fred.
[01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.500]  There was no cowardice there.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.120]  Fred was ready.
[01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.510]  Yeah, he's got the oblivious confidence of alcohol.
[01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.270]  He's looking for his dinosaur.
[01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.050]  Dino!
[01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.530]  Dino!
[01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:20.970]  That would be a wild crossover.
[01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:25.770]  Fred Flintstone in the Fast and Furious franchise and it's just his feet through the bottom of the car.
[01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:27.450]  Oh.
[01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:29.810]  Just running everywhere.
[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:31.830]  Just getting all scuffed up.
[01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:33.550]  He trying to drift.
[01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:35.950]  Get in.
[01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:41.630]  Who's crunching?
[01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:43.410]  Well, somebody's going to town.
[01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:44.950]  Who is crunching?
[01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:45.750]  Wasn't me.
[01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:47.970]  I think it's clearly Nick.
[01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:49.850]  No, I'm not eating, I promise.
[01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:51.590]  I had a bit of a cucumber.
[01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:54.710]  That was the loudest cucumber.
[01:16:55.890 --> 01:17:00.970]  Why did we have to go through the Rolodex of people instead of you saying I had a cucumber?
[01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:03.390]  I wanted to swallow it first.
[01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.930]  There's a real Andrew Switch moment there, Gavin, for you.
[01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:13.830]  Oh, that's why I had to jump on. I know I got caught with some pizza earlier. I had to clear my name.
[01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:15.330]  What kind of pizza did you have tonight?
[01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:21.210]  It's a pepperoni pizza with hot honey and a...
[01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:22.630]  Hot honey?
[01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:24.290]  Hot honey and...
[01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:26.490]  Hot honey's becoming real popular lately.
[01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:28.570]  It's alright.
[01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:34.010]  I feel like hot honey's over, but I could definitely see it being in like a frozen pizza thing.
[01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:37.930]  Was it fresh or frozen?
[01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.430]  Fresh.
[01:17:39.090 --> 01:17:39.650]  Damn!
[01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:42.570]  Did you have jalapenos too?
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:45.490]  No, it had like a feta type thing.
[01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.910]  It's good.
[01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:50.650]  Salty and sweet.
[01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:54.110]  What? What's wrong?
[01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:56.290]  So weird.
[01:17:56.930 --> 01:17:57.410]  What?
[01:17:57.810 --> 01:17:58.510]  I like food.
[01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.570]  Look, someone across the street sat down.
[01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:01.390]  Where?
[01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.550]  Oh my god!
[01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:04.150]  Holy shit!
[01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:07.970]  Gavin, you see things at the greatest of distances.
[01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:09.970]  You're brilliant, man. Sitting on the street, that's another one.
[01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:11.370]  I just needed a bit of fuel.
[01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:15.150]  Oh, the cuke helped you.
[01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.330]  We gotta cumber this guy up.
[01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:19.990]  Gavin's got cucumber eyes for the next few minutes.
[01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:23.170]  I like that when we have a snack...
[01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:24.370]  It's the benefits of carrot juice.
[01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:30.250]  When we have a snack, it's something dog shit. When Gavin has a snack, it's a cucumber.
[01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:34.790]  Are you starting with your carrot juice tomorrow, Andrew?
[01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:35.630]  No.
[01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.910]  I'm good.
[01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:38.270]  Yeah, did you finish that carrot juice?
[01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:39.150]  No.
[01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:40.050]  What?
[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:47.170]  My favorite part of that episode was Andrew explaining over and over again that it's 100% carrot juice and being amazed that it tasted like carrot.
[01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:48.110]  He couldn't...
[01:18:48.610 --> 01:18:51.110]  It's still in processing that it is so carrot-y.
[01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:55.350]  There are like five minutes where you're going, now what are the ingredients in this?
[01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:57.470]  And you just kept looking.
[01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:02.770]  It's just listed as carrot. Were you just making sure that they didn't sneak some other bullshit in there?
[01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:06.850]  I was just curious what else, like maybe there's some sugar in it, maybe, I don't know.
[01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:08.190]  It's just old carrots.
[01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.090]  Sugar carrots, my favorite.
[01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.870]  The flapper?
[01:19:15.570 --> 01:19:16.850]  No, no flapper.
[01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:18.650]  She was giving him an earful.
[01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.390]  No, she seems mad.
[01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.330]  Yes.
[01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:22.130]  Yeah, she seemed mad.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.040]  I think it's close.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:33.040]  It feels like I'm trying to do like a shitty joke here, but genuinely the only thing I'm essentially missing from my blackout is camo.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.500]  I need camo as well.
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.840]  Are those fishnets?
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:38.920]  No.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:39.500]  No.
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:40.040]  Yes.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:40.860]  Yes, they are.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.560]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.060]  They were.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:42.680]  They were.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.560]  They absolutely were.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:45.980]  Fuck yeah.
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.340]  I can't believe how long this person has been sat down.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.420]  Must be soaked.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.960]  Well, you hit a certain point of soakage.
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.480]  I think they've probably hit max soakage and it doesn't matter anymore.
[01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.200]  Like a sheet of bounty.
[01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.580]  Now I just need a Beetlejuice costume and I'm going to be able to repair.
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:05.740]  Oh shit.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.140]  Come on, come on, let's go.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:08.320]  Oh yeah, she's pissed.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.420]  Let's go.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.740]  Our one friend is mad, so it's our problem all night long.
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:15.920]  Well, you don't know what he did.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:16.940]  Yeah.
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:17.920]  Hey, you know what?
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:18.760]  Great point.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.280]  Got into a fight with Fred Flintstone a block away.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.440]  Yeah, you can't do that.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.240]  Fred Flintstone could have been her dad.
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.540]  Makes sense why she's so upset.
[01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.970]  Tom's a girl.
[01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:42.870]  Not rich enough, Nick.
[01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:44.730]  Oh, whoops. Sorry.
[01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:46.930]  He's so much richer than that.
[01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:49.010]  He also doesn't walk around anywhere.
[01:20:49.570 --> 01:20:52.830]  He'd be on a private plane down Duval right now.
[01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:56.270]  Oh, look at this.
[01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:01.710]  Oh, interesting. Overdone.
[01:21:02.210 --> 01:21:02.730]  More skeletons.
[01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:14.690]  I was disappointed to learn that the candy we got was regular Reese's Cups and not the Halloween shaped one.
[01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:16.250]  How disappointing.
[01:21:18.010 --> 01:21:25.830]  We got a variety pack that has like Twix and whatever, but it has gummy Lifesavers and gummy Skittles.
[01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:30.990]  I don't even really like gummy candy. They're so fucking good.
[01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:36.330]  I'm interested to see your arc on that because I loved gummy Skittles and then they just, I don't know, it changed.
[01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:36.830]  Oh, really?
[01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:40.630]  Yeah, I don't know. I was really high on them. I bought so many and then I was like, I don't know.
[01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:47.390]  Never had them before. They taste, they're so like Skittle adjacent in flavor. It's like, it's pretty uncanny.
[01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:50.190]  You ever tried the Skittle juice?
[01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.670]  We actually did yesterday.
[01:21:52.990 --> 01:21:54.870]  Is it good? Because I just ordered some.
[01:21:55.450 --> 01:21:56.050]  Nick, what do you think?
[01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.150]  Do I want? Yeah, it's good.
[01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.630]  Nick drank it and said, uh-oh.
[01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:09.090]  I said uh-oh because I feel like it's a perfect mixer.
[01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:16.870]  It is. It's so sweet, but in a way where you just go like, oh, like, this does a good job.
[01:22:17.170 --> 01:22:23.130]  If you cut it with some booze though, you wouldn't be able to tell it was sweet or boozy. You know what I mean? Like that perfect line.
[01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:26.630]  Oh, wow. This guy's like separating them from the girls.
[01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.350]  Who the fuck is that guy?
[01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:30.950]  Who is he supposed to be?
[01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:32.630]  He's a disco guy.
[01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:34.150]  Disco guy.
[01:22:34.150 --> 01:22:34.690]  Okay.
[01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:39.890]  I want to keep watching this fight develop.
[01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:45.650]  I just wish that their friend in a hot dog costume would show up.
[01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:56.590]  Latida. That was a fancy restaurant, I believe.
[01:23:00.570 --> 01:23:02.610]  Latida. I believe it says Latida.
[01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:05.170]  Latida.
[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:08.470]  Latida.
[01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.250]  The other tea rubbed off.
[01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:15.050]  Meh.
[01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:19.930]  The cones!
[01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:21.990]  They're so excited to see the cones.
[01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.950]  They aren't multiplying.
[01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:24.970]  They haven't played GTA 1.
[01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:26.890]  No, I've never played it.
[01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.110]  No.
[01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:31.390]  I don't understand. Why do the cones say stop?
[01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:34.410]  They're stop cones.
[01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.670]  Yeah.
[01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.530]  They're like the deleted gang from the Warriors.
[01:23:41.210 --> 01:23:42.930]  Oh, you almost fell.
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.040]  She's shuffling.
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:58.700]  Oh, that's a full on...
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.480]  That's a pumpkin.
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:01.220]  Yeah, a pumpkin. Right there.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:03.940]  There's Eric.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:05.220]  Whoa, look at this guy.
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.200]  That was Eric.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]  The white guy with the mustache.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.380]  We haven't seen Batman, have we?
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.240]  That's also surprising.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:16.160]  We saw him before we started.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:19.660]  And Scooby-Doo.
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:20.860]  That's true.
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.100]  I hope that guy's okay wherever he is.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.180]  We got cops moving.
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:37.800]  Steampunk.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.460]  Steampunk grandpa?
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.020]  Oh my god.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.320]  Steampunk grandpa.
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:43.760]  That's awesome.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:45.280]  Steam.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.000]  Steampunkpa.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.620]  Does that count as a pop-up?
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:50.720]  Steampopunk.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:52.500]  I think that was a pop-up.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:53.760]  You don't think so?
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:54.500]  You know what? Yeah.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:55.400]  Yeah.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.200]  Hell yeah.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.780]  I'll give it to you just because we're so deep in this, but...
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.080]  Yeah.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.700]  I won't be happy about it, but I'll do it.
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.880]  40 minutes ago, I would argue tooth and nail, baby.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.100]  Yeah, absolutely. Eric's right.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.120]  Does your dog know it's Halloween?
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:15.780]  Who are you talking to?
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:16.820]  You.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.660]  I mean, we talked about it in front of him.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:24.780]  I didn't try to keep it from him.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.040]  Does your dog know what year it is?
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.700]  Yeah, does your dog know what year it is?
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:32.920]  Uh...
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.620]  I mean, we have a calendar in the kitchen that he can see.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.400]  Okay. You say so.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:44.460]  Yeah, I mean, kids have been coming up and getting candy all night, ringing the doorbell, so...
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:48.060]  He's kind of got it figured out.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:48.880]  I think.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:56.840]  Do you think you not getting your dog an outfit has hurt the overall chances of dog outfit tonight?
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.580]  Ooh, that's a great question.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.600]  It's a very good point.
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:05.000]  Could have doomed myself karmically.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:17.060]  Oh, hell yeah. These Russian meerkats I follow on Instagram posted a Halloween video where the meerkat is wearing a sheet like a ghost.
[01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:19.860]  Oh, great. Do you follow more animals than humans?
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.260]  It's gotta be about 50-50.
[01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:28.070]  It's gotta be near 50-50.
[01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:32.290]  I'm a big Rock Hyrax guy right now.
[01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:34.470]  Rock Hyrax?
[01:26:34.630 --> 01:26:34.930]  Yeah.
[01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:37.770]  They're like, uh...
[01:26:37.770 --> 01:26:38.770]  It's like if a...
[01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:40.930]  Jesus Christ!
[01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:42.390]  Oh my God!
[01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:45.210]  Oh my God!
[01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:48.030]  Was she hesitating or was she just drunk as shit?
[01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.810]  She's drunk as shit, dude.
[01:26:51.070 --> 01:26:53.010]  This chef is getting in a fight with this taxi.
[01:26:54.630 --> 01:26:56.070]  Did you guys see that?
[01:26:56.530 --> 01:26:56.790]  Oh, man.
[01:26:57.590 --> 01:27:01.010]  Jesus Christ. I was fucking too busy staring at that lady.
[01:27:02.290 --> 01:27:02.590]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.170 --> 01:27:04.710]  Sorry, Rock Hyrax is what?
[01:27:04.770 --> 01:27:07.450]  Oh, yeah. It's like if a Pikachu was real, kind of.
[01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:08.630]  Okay, awesome.
[01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:13.730]  It's like a little mouse guy that lives in the mountains and it goes...
[01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:14.710]  It's pretty cool.
[01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:19.810]  Another devil.
[01:27:21.250 --> 01:27:24.810]  Imagine Satan being bumped to take a photo with traffic cones.
[01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:28.130]  Classic Satan.
[01:27:28.570 --> 01:27:28.990]  Classic Satan.
[01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:30.330]  He loves things that annoy people.
[01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:33.810]  Oh, that lady picked up trash. That was nice of her.
[01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.930]  Good Samaritan.
[01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:41.890]  Andrew, how many do you need for a blackout?
[01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:43.030]  Oh, it's done.
[01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.850]  Five.
[01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:50.230]  It's all of a sudden starting to look real sloppy.
[01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:52.110]  There's something in that pocket.
[01:27:52.330 --> 01:27:54.310]  I feel like there's been a...
[01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.810]  Uh-oh.
[01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:59.270]  Oh, is that inflatable?
[01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:00.150]  Yeah.
[01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:03.710]  Across the street.
[01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:04.650]  I got it.
[01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:07.450]  I finally have a boo bingo.
[01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:08.330]  Nice.
[01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:08.890]  Well done.
[01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:10.830]  Yeah, my boo bingo is...
[01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:11.350]  Jump in front of that car.
[01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.030]  Is that Peanut Butter?
[01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.570]  He has it.
[01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.710]  It's Peanut Butter!
[01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:19.150]  Get in! Get in! Get closer!
[01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:22.030]  He's got it.
[01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:23.750]  He got the Peanut Butter!
[01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:25.470]  Oh my God.
[01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:30.190]  How the fuck is the only thing I'm missing a Beetlejuice costume?
[01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:32.790]  The slow reveal of the jaw.
[01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:34.310]  Oh, what a reveal!
[01:28:34.630 --> 01:28:35.590]  He did it!
[01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:37.310]  He's a legend!
[01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:38.530]  Son of a bitch.
[01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.310]  Send him a shirt!
[01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:41.010]  That's brilliant.
[01:28:42.330 --> 01:28:43.510]  Send him something!
[01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:45.270]  He gets one of those Ian pins.
[01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:49.310]  Absolutely insane.
[01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:51.990]  Oh my God, that guy's wearing purple and green.
[01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:52.890]  Those are green shorts.
[01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:54.010]  That's fucking terrible.
[01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:55.690]  Oh, camo.
[01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:56.250]  That's camo.
[01:28:57.010 --> 01:28:57.970]  There's camo!
[01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:59.310]  Camo shorts.
[01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:01.510]  There's camo!
[01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:03.630]  It's spitting everywhere.
[01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:04.430]  I'm too excited.
[01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:07.070]  Oh my God, Dan.
[01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:08.190]  That's so great.
[01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:09.070]  He's so happy.
[01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:09.650]  Hell yeah.
[01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:11.070]  Take a victory lap, buddy.
[01:29:11.610 --> 01:29:13.150]  I want to get a beer with this guy.
[01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:14.630]  That's so funny.
[01:29:14.650 --> 01:29:16.430]  You should start a new channel with him.
[01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:20.470]  It's the same thing.
[01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:22.330]  You don't change anything.
[01:29:22.810 --> 01:29:24.770]  He's just a different Dan.
[01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:27.950]  And you and Dan dubs the voice.
[01:29:29.210 --> 01:29:30.530]  What if it's fast mode, guys?
[01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:31.530]  You just do fast.
[01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:35.470]  What the fuck is going on now?
[01:29:35.710 --> 01:29:36.890]  He's making friends.
[01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:38.210]  Oh my God.
[01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:38.930]  Like Crocodile Dundee.
[01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:43.810]  What the fuck?
[01:29:44.650 --> 01:29:45.950]  There's Bob Ross over there.
[01:29:46.190 --> 01:29:46.410]  Oh my God.
[01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:48.170]  On the upper right.
[01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:49.870]  It's the mask.
[01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:50.990]  Top left.
[01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:52.610]  It's a Jim Carrey outfit.
[01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:53.530]  Oh, shit.
[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:55.250]  That's body paint.
[01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:55.890]  That is...
[01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:56.270]  Oh, body paint.
[01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:57.390]  Oh, that is...
[01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:58.090]  Oh, yes.
[01:29:58.210 --> 01:29:59.050]  Body paint.
[01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.930]  Nick.
[01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:01.770]  Nick.
[01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:02.290]  He's okay.
[01:30:02.410 --> 01:30:02.710]  You're fine.
[01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:03.310]  You're good.
[01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.650]  I flipped it.
[01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:04.030]  I flipped it.
[01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:05.290]  I flipped it.
[01:30:05.310 --> 01:30:05.350]  I flipped it.
[01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.710]  I flipped it.
[01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:06.130]  I flipped it.
[01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:06.330]  I flipped it.
[01:30:07.450 --> 01:30:08.470]  I flipped it.
[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.830]  It went.
[01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:10.930]  Thank you.
[01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:12.870]  That's another one for Jack.
[01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:17.150]  She also had her hands perfectly over the nerps there, so we're good.
[01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:18.730]  The nerps.
[01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:19.250]  Jim Carrey.
[01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:22.250]  It's getting sloppy.
[01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.430]  Oh, that guy.
[01:30:24.670 --> 01:30:25.730]  He was real close.
[01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:28.250]  Fall into the bike rack.
[01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:28.850]  Oh, good.
[01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:29.370]  It's raining.
[01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:30.310]  Oh.
[01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.750]  Oh.
[01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.330]  Uh-oh.
[01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:32.350]  Uh-oh.
[01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:32.830]  Uh-oh.
[01:30:33.290 --> 01:30:33.530]  Wait.
[01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:34.150]  It's popping off.
[01:30:35.410 --> 01:30:35.850]  Oh.
[01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:36.830]  Oh.
[01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.430]  Oh.
[01:30:38.050 --> 01:30:38.490]  Oh.
[01:30:38.890 --> 01:30:39.330]  Oh.
[01:30:39.350 --> 01:30:39.530]  Oh.
[01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:41.010]  He got him.
[01:30:41.150 --> 01:30:42.210]  It looks like a muscular Greg Davis.
[01:30:42.210 --> 01:30:42.250]  He's holding on.
[01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:43.070]  We're good.
[01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:43.550]  We're good.
[01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:44.830]  This guy is good.
[01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:45.350]  He's good.
[01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:46.350]  We're gone.
[01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:47.190]  Holy shit.
[01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:49.070]  Goodness gracious.
[01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.830]  Recover.
[01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:51.590]  Why isn't he in a...
[01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:53.450]  He's going to fall and he's not even in a costume.
[01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:56.770]  It's just some guy picking his nose.
[01:30:59.270 --> 01:31:01.350]  Gavin, is that not a buff Greg Davis?
[01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:03.570]  Oh, he's getting Larry.
[01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:05.210]  It doesn't even count.
[01:31:05.890 --> 01:31:07.710]  Oh, he didn't fall.
[01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:08.750]  That was insane.
[01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:12.510]  That dude was like the spinning top in Inception.
[01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:13.810]  We just kept waiting.
[01:31:15.150 --> 01:31:16.830]  And we don't know how it ends still.
[01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:17.570]  Yeah.
[01:31:19.150 --> 01:31:19.530]  Oh.
[01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.390]  That was the drunkest guy I've seen on stream.
[01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:27.230]  That was by far the drunkest guy I've seen on this stream.
[01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:30.390]  What sucks is that he's probably face down in the street further up the road.
[01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:34.810]  Oh, you know, remember at fucking eye level, they're even drunker.
[01:31:35.010 --> 01:31:35.850]  So he was...
[01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:37.770]  That must be insane to see in person.
[01:31:37.770 --> 01:31:38.890]  Oh, he's still twisting like a Beyblade.
[01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:40.570]  He's just out there spinning.
[01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:51.470]  I need to almost get hit by car, clown car, trip, and separated at sidewalk.
[01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:53.150]  What do I need?
[01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:55.430]  You just got lucky that there wasn't a car.
[01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:58.230]  Because he would absolutely have been almost hit by a car.
[01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:59.970]  I need somebody to yawn.
[01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:01.210]  That's going to be tough.
[01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:02.270]  I need somebody to cry.
[01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:03.350]  That's going to be tough.
[01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.790]  Handshake.
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.920]  Nick, how many are you away?
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.100]  From a regular blackout?
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:18.640]  Five.
[01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:19.700]  Damn.
[01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:23.820]  But I have like the same things that you do plus two other things.
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:28.480]  I need one more for a boo blackout and four more for a regular card blackout.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:30.140]  Oh, you need Beetlejuice?
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:31.760]  I need Beetlejuice.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.960]  Well, I think we call it on either blackout.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:36.080]  Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.340]  That sounds fair.
[01:32:40.230 --> 01:32:41.710]  Dan, dress up like Beetlejuice.
[01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:43.490]  It's been a great one, though.
[01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:44.750]  I think this is one of my favorites.
[01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:46.330]  It's been an all-time classic.
[01:32:47.010 --> 01:32:48.850]  Honestly, Dan has been such a great one.
[01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:51.470]  Because it was like, I thought this was going to be sloppier and crazier.
[01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:55.750]  And it's just been sort of sparse and flaky.
[01:32:56.190 --> 01:32:56.630]  Turd Ferguson.
[01:32:59.610 --> 01:33:00.330]  Jesus Christ.
[01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:04.130]  This is something, man.
[01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:05.670]  Ended on a high note.
[01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:11.420]  They're not camera shy, but they seem camera confused.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.220]  When I'm old, I want a rock-hard gut like that.
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.740]  Hey, man, if you start training now, you can get there.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.640]  Fall, fall, fall, fall, fall.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.140]  What's the secret to the gut success?
[01:33:24.220 --> 01:33:26.960]  Trippy pirate, trippy pirate, trippy pirate, trippy pirate.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:27.940]  Oh, you bitch.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:28.300]  Roll it.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.000]  Oh, he almost did.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.080]  He stumbled, but he didn't trip.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:39.160]  Somebody almost get hit by a car.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:47.400]  Ooh, honk.
[01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.740]  Everybody seems to be in a good mood tonight.
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.140]  Not a lot of fighting going on.
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.040]  It's true.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:54.460]  Dude on dude scooter.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:55.860]  Dude on dude scooter.
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:56.220]  Yes, it is.
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:56.860]  No, it's not.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:57.600]  Oh, no, it wasn't.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.100]  That was dude on dude, wasn't it?
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:33:59.540]  Was it?
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:00.960]  I'm clear.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.380]  I'm going to mark it.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.580]  I think that's fair.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.220]  We're at the point of not fighting about things.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:10.760]  Yeah.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.060]  Yeah, you're good.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:13.220]  We're kind of supporting each other.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:13.940]  Like, yeah, that looks good.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:14.960]  Here's a picture.
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.920]  My eyes are peeled for a...
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.160]  I'm looking for a Beetlejuice costume so fucking bad.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.660]  I'm far more alert now about body paint as well.
[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:31.000]  That taxi is packed.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:35.380]  Well, we only seen it once, so I don't think we have to worry about it.
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:36.380]  Nah.
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:38.860]  I wish we hadn't.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:41.800]  I guess that's more of a fantasy fest thing, which was last week.
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:44.840]  Oh, this guy again.
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.860]  What is fantasy fest?
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.760]  That's the thing they do every October where they...
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.500]  We did it last year. We talked about it.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:59.000]  It's like a big festival in the street and they have parades and everybody gets naked.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.280]  It's all adult themed, like leading up to Halloween.
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:06.380]  Upside down pineapples everywhere?
[01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:10.280]  Yeah, a lot of that kind of stuff, I think.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.980]  Is this Bob Ross?
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:20.720]  We were looking at the camping option for a particular thing as opposed to staying in a hotel or something.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:28.080]  For this particular event, Amanda did a bunch of research on it and they were like,
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:39.320]  Don't take children. There's lots of nudity and messing around in the open around a big fire.
[01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:43.870]  So we're not doing that.
[01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:45.410]  Was there going to be Beetlejuice there?
[01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:49.550]  Maybe. Elvis is back.
[01:35:49.710 --> 01:35:50.010]  No!
[01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:53.150]  Not this guy.
[01:35:55.710 --> 01:35:56.970]  Oh, good, he's leaving. Good.
[01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:01.990]  Well, this guy's a bit stumbly.
[01:36:02.230 --> 01:36:04.670]  Yeah, he's been stumbling a little bit.
[01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:05.570]  He's having fun.
[01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:08.090]  He just pulled out a bottle of pills.
[01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:10.930]  Now I get it.
[01:36:11.470 --> 01:36:12.690]  Oh, that's a massive jar of pills.
[01:36:12.690 --> 01:36:13.870]  He pulled out another bottle of pills.
[01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:18.690]  Bro, if you're gonna sell stuff, go over there.
[01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:20.350]  They call him Dr. Feelgood.
[01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:27.630]  Scary hands.
[01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:28.570]  Spooky.
[01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:31.470]  Oh, fake blood.
[01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:32.770]  Oh, that's more fake blood.
[01:36:38.010 --> 01:36:40.990]  Do you have any garlic in the premises?
[01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:43.210]  Was that someone getting spooked, do you think?
[01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:45.150]  What's the mirror situation?
[01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:48.910]  Can I come in?
[01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:56.290]  Fuck, we gotta try another place.
[01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:58.510]  Elvis said no.
[01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:00.870]  He keeps saying no.
[01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:12.250]  That car has a fucking tribal tattoo.
[01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:13.670]  That's awesome.
[01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:17.670]  That's the most 1998 car you can have.
[01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:26.090]  That car likes to play sublime songs on guitar in front of a bonfire.
[01:37:26.490 --> 01:37:29.730]  That car has so many opinions about offspring albums.
[01:37:30.630 --> 01:37:33.150]  That car has a sun tattoo on the other side.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:43.420]  I don't think we're getting Beetlejuice.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.060]  Oh, this lady might fucking fall right here.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:47.320]  She's not in a costume though.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.600]  Oh, but only if she...
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:55.200]  Well, it's been a wildly successful evening either way.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.380]  Yeah, this has been good.
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.400]  We had like 3,000 people watching, which is ridiculous.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.040]  Yeah, we won't quite get to the blackout, but man, this has been a really good one.
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.280]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.060]  Dan, congratulations, you're the MVP tonight.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.920]  It really is, undeniably.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:11.060]  I thought that was really incredible.
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.340]  Dan, another handshake, man.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.780]  Yeah, oh my god, it's just... I've watched it like 10 times already.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:20.180]  I just keep watching the clip.
[01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:23.000]  What the fuck is that outfit?
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.680]  Oh, is that a popo? Is this guy?
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.520]  No, that guy's just cool.
[01:38:29.180 --> 01:38:32.140]  Nah, that's a big stick.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:34.480]  Thanks for noticing.
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.360]  Mark it on your board.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:36.880]  You must talk softly.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.880]  If only we could get it, like, just one more.
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.700]  And we could just call it on whatever the last one we see is, you know?
[01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.060]  Could be anything.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.080]  Could be anything.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:56.160]  People are photoshopping...
[01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:58.580]  Somebody posted on the subreddit,
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.440]  Beetlejuice and Sloppy Joe's,
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.020]  and it's their dog dressed in a Beetlejuice costume
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:06.860]  that they photoshopped on the street in front of Sloppy Joe's.
[01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.920]  Oh, these guys almost got hit by a car.
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:10.240]  Sitting in the street.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.300]  What is this about?
[01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.260]  I'm marking this as almost got hit by a car.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:19.040]  Yeah, I think that's fair.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.100]  I agree.
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.640]  What's Dan doing with these cones now?
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.380]  He found a new crew.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.760]  He's outgrown us, he doesn't need us anymore.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:28.880]  You think he's like, guys, listen,
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.940]  you guys gotta all stand in the street
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:32.280]  and block the cars.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.340]  He's like, hear me out, we call a cone mo, guys.
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.320]  It's gonna be huge.
[01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:43.290]  Now, the goal is to almost get hit,
[01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:44.350]  but not get hit.
[01:39:44.850 --> 01:39:46.530]  And go.
[01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:49.010]  See, we can't leave on Dan.
[01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.790]  Five, six.
[01:39:58.420 --> 01:39:58.960]  Trip.
[01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.780]  Trippin' that costume.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.380]  You trippin' that costume.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.220]  You trippin' the boots.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:09.640]  Boots are made for trippin'.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.820]  Step backwards.
[01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:24.270]  How come all these people
[01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:26.450]  are so much more sure-footed
[01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:28.110]  when they're drunk than I ever was?
[01:40:32.770 --> 01:40:34.690]  These guys spend a lot less time
[01:40:34.690 --> 01:40:36.550]  in bushes than I would be right now.
[01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:39.470]  That guy definitely almost got hit by a car.
[01:40:39.610 --> 01:40:40.330]  He ran right out on the street.
[01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:41.690]  Are we getting up-coned?
[01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:43.430]  Are we getting up-coned shot?
[01:40:45.070 --> 01:40:45.790]  Up right?
[01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:51.740]  That's a rowdy sentence.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:53.060]  That's...
[01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:02.590]  See, they're having no problem sitting down.
[01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.410]  I was thinking the same thing.
[01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:05.850]  I wasn't going to say anything, Gavin.
[01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:07.570]  Thought it the whole time.
[01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:08.710]  Shut up.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.240]  Well, there's evil Knievel.
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:15.760]  Knievel?
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:18.520]  Isn't that Cleopatra, maybe?
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.300]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.240]  Oh.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.460]  Oh, what's he got?
[01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:34.900]  Rubbish Man!
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.320]  Roll a Rubbish Man!
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:41.240]  Hell yeah.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.240]  I needed six.
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.680]  I needed three.
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:46.880]  I need three more.
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.240]  I need camera-shy, honking, and crying.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.900]  Oh, those are my shorts.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.120]  So we've seen Geoff, we've seen Eric, and me now.
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:57.180]  Very nice.
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:58.780]  It's a dance party.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.200]  Well, guys, I think we did it.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.040]  I think that's as far as we're going to get tonight.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:03.680]  This was a lot of fun.
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:07.340]  What a great way to end it.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:08.940]  Yeah, this has been a really good one.
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.140]  Thanks for watching Sloppy Joe's Bingo
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.420]  on All Hallows Eve.
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:15.700]  Awesome.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.220]  Very cool.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:18.540]  Oh.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.680]  Now they're pissing people off.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:21.640]  Oh, boy.
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.780]  Oh, my God.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.700]  Well, thanks for watching.
[01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.060]  Go to patreon.com slash regulation pod
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.780]  if you want to check out more of this.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:35.320]  If you want to watch this VOD later, you can.
[01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:36.960]  I don't remember what day we're uploading it,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:37.780]  but it's pretty soon.
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.280]  You can let us know all the things we missed.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.120]  And you go, ugh, I can't believe they missed that thing.
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:43.680]  That's fine.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.560]  Yeah, I wonder how many Beetlejuices there were.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:47.840]  So many.
[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.120]  Guaranteed.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.040]  We didn't really win anything.
[01:42:51.460 --> 01:42:54.400]  Just the opportunity to go buy our own cake.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:55.420]  Yeah.
[01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:58.380]  And this was a fun-ass Sloppy Joe's.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.520]  This was a fun one.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.880]  Hope you guys had fun watching it.
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:04.780]  Check out the podcast. Check out the gameplay channels.
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:06.460]  We have a lot of stuff.
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.440]  We have a stream here tomorrow
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:10.600]  at 4 p.m. Central
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.040]  that involves you.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:14.760]  We're going to be playing Trivial Pursuit 2
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:16.780]  with you,
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:18.720]  the audience.
[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:20.420]  Andrew, how does that work?
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.940]  They'll be able to input guesses
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:25.180]  to questions, and it'll be us against them,
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:25.720]  essentially.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.300]  Bone up on your trivia, audience.
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.420]  You'll just be able to enter responses
[01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:31.380]  in the chat.
[01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:33.000]  Don't point at us. Point at you.
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.080]  Don't point at us. Point at you.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.720]  So there you go, guys. Thanks for watching.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:40.840]  This has been Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:42.900]  Dan, thank you, Dan.
[01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.180]  Bye, Dan.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.400]  Way to go, Dan. Thanks for double-fisting.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:47.460]  Way to go. Oh, my God.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.880]  I thought he was going for it. Way to go, Dan.
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:50.760]  On a high note.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:51.680]  Bye.
[01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:54.100]  Bye, Dan.
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:54.500]  Bye.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:01.440]  Keep going.
[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.000]  No, we're out.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:05.360]  Oh, my God.
[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.560]  This will be good for the VOD, though.
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.780]  Keep going.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:16.340]  Selfie. Oh, selfie.
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:21.460]  Good work.
