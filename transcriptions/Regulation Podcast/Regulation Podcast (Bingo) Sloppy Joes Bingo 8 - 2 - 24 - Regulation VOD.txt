[00:00.000 --> 00:04.240]  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[00:04.260 --> 00:06.740]  Just before we go live, I have a bunch of questions about our finances.
[00:07.180 --> 00:08.480]  Alright, we are now in the bathroom.
[00:08.480 --> 00:12.140]  So I was watching this TikTok about speed.
[00:12.140 --> 00:15.120]  Can we actually push this? Is there a way we can start a conversation?
[00:15.380 --> 00:16.840]  And Geoff Daniels...
[00:16.840 --> 00:18.060]  There's that underlight.
[00:18.360 --> 00:19.480]  Look at that dickhead truck.
[00:19.540 --> 00:20.360]  That's a big dickhead truck.
[00:20.520 --> 00:20.940]  Underlight!
[00:21.620 --> 00:22.060]  Underlight!
[00:22.300 --> 00:25.980]  I mean, too bad we haven't started yet.
[00:26.080 --> 00:28.420]  It's 7! We went live!
[00:28.420 --> 00:30.220]  That's definitely an underlight.
[00:30.240 --> 00:32.860]  Yeah, we went live and that's not the start of Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[00:32.920 --> 00:34.380]  You know it's not the start.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.460]  You absolutely know it's not the start.
[00:36.580 --> 00:39.040]  100% know it's not the start.
[00:39.860 --> 00:43.040]  Don't take your anger out on me from Gavin.
[00:43.400 --> 00:45.520]  It is not the beginning of Sloppy Joe's.
[00:46.020 --> 00:48.180]  We're live and we're watching and we're all recording.
[00:48.380 --> 00:50.640]  Yes, and you know that's not how it works.
[00:50.920 --> 00:51.680]  How does it work?
[00:52.320 --> 00:54.100]  We have to cool the beginning, Andrew.
[00:54.100 --> 00:56.900]  Hey guys, what's going on? Welcome to Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[00:56.900 --> 01:00.580]  You know it doesn't start until slop o'clock or we say go.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.780]  Thank you so much for joining us live.
[01:03.480 --> 01:05.260]  We're excited to have everyone here.
[01:05.400 --> 01:07.280]  Look at all the things you can have right now, Andrew.
[01:07.620 --> 01:09.800]  Look at all the things that you don't get to mark off on your board.
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.900]  I already marked Car Underglow.
[01:12.540 --> 01:13.000]  Oh, cool.
[01:13.420 --> 01:15.080]  No, you didn't. You better unmark it.
[01:15.320 --> 01:17.540]  This is a debunked round.
[01:18.080 --> 01:18.640]  Doesn't count.
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.020]  This does not fucking count.
[01:20.220 --> 01:20.940]  No, you don't.
[01:22.080 --> 01:23.120]  How dare you.
[01:23.320 --> 01:25.060]  It doesn't count, Andrew. I'm not going to do it.
[01:25.360 --> 01:25.940]  We have to wait.
[01:25.940 --> 01:28.900]  For what? Somebody start it. Why are we here?
[01:29.260 --> 01:30.560]  How have we not started yet?
[01:30.660 --> 01:32.580]  Look, there's a bachelorette party right there.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.680]  I'm not crying about it because we haven't started it yet.
[01:36.900 --> 01:40.400]  And that lady right there, she's got fancy clothes on.
[01:40.460 --> 01:42.520]  Whatever, she's just to the nines, whatever that one is.
[01:42.980 --> 01:44.100]  Man, these are great.
[01:44.360 --> 01:46.080]  Look, there's another dickhead truck over there.
[01:46.160 --> 01:48.640]  I can't mark that off because we haven't started yet.
[01:49.040 --> 01:49.980]  Can we start?
[01:50.080 --> 01:51.880]  There are the piss rats in the chat.
[01:51.960 --> 01:52.380]  What's up, piss rats?
[01:52.660 --> 01:54.900]  What's up, corn cats?
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.200]  Where are those corn cats at?
[01:56.660 --> 01:57.400]  Getting catty.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.600]  Guys, we're back.
[02:00.780 --> 02:03.660]  And we did a very special thing for this Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[02:04.140 --> 02:07.120]  Typically, we auto-generate our own cards.
[02:07.340 --> 02:08.880]  But Andrew had an idea.
[02:09.600 --> 02:10.380]  A great idea.
[02:12.340 --> 02:13.380]  What happened?
[02:13.460 --> 02:13.800]  What was that?
[02:13.980 --> 02:14.580]  It's refreshing.
[02:14.840 --> 02:17.900]  No, no, no. I mean, why did you go...
[02:18.520 --> 02:21.580]  Because my mouse was moving so slowly.
[02:23.620 --> 02:32.860]  Andrew had a really great idea where we would draft the elements that would become our bingo boards so we could put those into a generator.
[02:33.280 --> 02:36.500]  And then it would make a bingo board that was personalized to what we picked.
[02:37.040 --> 02:38.220]  It's really awesome.
[02:38.340 --> 02:43.880]  And if you want to watch that video, it is up for Falcons and above on Patreon.
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.440]  You go to regulatreon.com or patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[02:48.540 --> 02:50.100]  You can subscribe right there.
[02:50.220 --> 02:51.260]  Go check out that video.
[02:51.260 --> 02:55.580]  We did it live, but the video is up on Patreon now if you want to go watch it.
[02:55.700 --> 02:56.720]  But you should watch this first.
[02:57.260 --> 02:59.060]  There's just an order of operations typically.
[02:59.640 --> 03:02.940]  Yeah, and also if you don't want to go pay and watch it, that's fine too.
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.060]  You can still enjoy this for free right now.
[03:05.420 --> 03:10.520]  There also is a post live on our Patreon right now that you can go to that has all of our cards.
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.620]  So if you want to pick a player to play alongside, you can be in the running for the cake.
[03:16.340 --> 03:17.300]  Oh, that's awesome.
[03:17.300 --> 03:24.200]  That's awesome. Or if you wanted to just generate your own from the bingo generator, we'll have different prompts, I believe, because these are special.
[03:24.460 --> 03:24.820]  Yeah.
[03:25.160 --> 03:31.580]  But speaking of which, some of our prompts are from Falcons, from the Patreon Falcon members.
[03:31.780 --> 03:35.040]  We let them submit a bunch of prompts, about 25, I want to say.
[03:35.100 --> 03:35.300]  Yeah.
[03:35.380 --> 03:36.420]  We got some new additions.
[03:36.760 --> 03:39.640]  Do you think it's worth reading maybe some of the new ones that we've got on our cards?
[03:39.920 --> 03:40.260]  No.
[03:40.440 --> 03:40.600]  Yeah.
[03:41.020 --> 03:41.220]  No.
[03:45.860 --> 03:46.380]  Okay.
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.060]  All right.
[03:50.280 --> 03:52.380]  Hey, did Gavin have an idea?
[03:52.700 --> 03:54.880]  I think Andrew's against it today.
[03:55.320 --> 03:56.820]  I'm just teasing.
[03:58.500 --> 04:01.160]  I got dog.
[04:01.280 --> 04:01.900]  That's a new one.
[04:02.220 --> 04:03.320]  That's one of the new ones I have.
[04:03.700 --> 04:03.840]  Yeah.
[04:03.940 --> 04:06.920]  Why is my thing being clicked?
[04:07.540 --> 04:07.940]  What do you mean?
[04:07.960 --> 04:09.000]  What are you talking about?
[04:09.060 --> 04:10.180]  What's going on?
[04:10.180 --> 04:11.280]  What does that mean?
[04:11.800 --> 04:12.280]  Oh shit!
[04:12.620 --> 04:13.040]  It's on the clock!
[04:13.200 --> 04:13.780]  It's on the clock!
[04:16.840 --> 04:18.180]  What's up, dude?
[04:18.380 --> 04:19.640]  That was awesome!
[04:19.880 --> 04:21.240]  I fucking love that guy.
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.480]  He comes on the stream all the time.
[04:23.940 --> 04:24.500]  Dude, that's so cool.
[04:24.500 --> 04:26.480]  Are you giving me a gammy card?
[04:27.100 --> 04:27.580]  I don't know.
[04:27.700 --> 04:28.720]  Do you have a gammy card?
[04:29.500 --> 04:31.200]  Everyone's clicking all over my shit.
[04:31.380 --> 04:32.600]  All my shit's going metal.
[04:32.980 --> 04:33.320]  I know.
[04:33.360 --> 04:35.280]  Wait, why is mine going crazy too?
[04:36.020 --> 04:37.500]  Why have you made them...
[04:37.500 --> 04:39.460]  No, mine works fine.
[04:39.460 --> 04:41.180]  Everyone, look at yours.
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.980]  Yeah, everyone's clicking all over my shit.
[04:44.060 --> 04:44.660]  It's going metal.
[04:44.960 --> 04:46.240]  It's going metal.
[04:46.380 --> 04:47.140]  It's going apeshit.
[04:47.960 --> 04:49.400]  Everyone's clicking everything.
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.320]  Nick, Geoff, look at yours.
[04:51.860 --> 04:52.640]  Mine's fine.
[04:53.100 --> 04:55.260]  Mine is not fine.
[04:55.440 --> 04:57.400]  Andrew has sabotaged me and Gavin.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.400]  Mine is totally fine.
[04:59.920 --> 05:01.400]  Andrew's going full Boston.
[05:01.980 --> 05:04.500]  He's publicly linked to my card.
[05:04.600 --> 05:07.240]  I linked all the cards, you fool!
[05:07.240 --> 05:08.420]  They're all linked!
[05:13.030 --> 05:15.670]  He gave us... he used our direct link.
[05:15.770 --> 05:19.070]  So this is why, Gavin, when we talked about it earlier,
[05:19.350 --> 05:21.950]  we talked about it earlier and they were like,
[05:22.030 --> 05:23.290]  oh, we generated our cards.
[05:23.870 --> 05:25.970]  And you and I were like,
[05:26.270 --> 05:27.450]  oh, that's weird.
[05:27.750 --> 05:29.690]  We got ours generated already.
[05:30.190 --> 05:32.750]  And we've just had these linked to everyone.
[05:33.430 --> 05:35.330]  You've got to stream my card right now.
[05:35.390 --> 05:36.990]  You've got to show what my card is doing.
[05:38.810 --> 05:41.130]  Gavin, this would be a perfect opportunity
[05:41.130 --> 05:43.830]  for you to hit him with a hard doofus.
[05:44.890 --> 05:46.090]  This is a great move.
[05:47.190 --> 05:48.010]  He's a genius.
[05:48.190 --> 05:49.550]  This is absolutely on purpose.
[05:49.710 --> 05:52.790]  I just took a screenshot of my blank card on my phone,
[05:52.930 --> 05:54.490]  so I'll just be using it that way.
[05:54.630 --> 05:57.390]  I won't be clicking on it with all of you dipshits.
[05:57.810 --> 05:59.730]  I don't have to worry about you morons.
[05:59.890 --> 06:01.570]  Can't you just generate your own?
[06:02.110 --> 06:03.650]  Let me show this here.
[06:04.990 --> 06:06.470]  What's happening to my card?
[06:06.470 --> 06:08.130]  Oh my god.
[06:08.170 --> 06:10.990]  Yeah, why don't you just generate another one, Gavin?
[06:11.710 --> 06:15.570]  Oh my god.
[06:15.730 --> 06:17.910]  I don't think I can play, guys.
[06:18.270 --> 06:20.390]  Mine looks like that also.
[06:22.810 --> 06:24.230]  It's like a disco.
[06:24.690 --> 06:25.790]  I'm still watching.
[06:26.130 --> 06:27.630]  Let me try to send you another one.
[06:28.210 --> 06:28.970]  Oh Christ.
[06:29.630 --> 06:33.330]  Alright, can I have one where everyone in the world doesn't know my card layout?
[06:33.470 --> 06:35.170]  Yeah, that would be great if I had that also.
[06:36.110 --> 06:38.830]  Good thing we didn't start. There's another bachelorette party.
[06:41.690 --> 06:42.690]  You're having a good time.
[06:42.970 --> 06:44.910]  A fucking pink taxi's gonna go by.
[06:45.070 --> 06:46.050]  I want it. I want it now.
[06:46.210 --> 06:47.030]  I'm gonna be so pissed.
[06:47.290 --> 06:49.190]  Andrew, you gave me the same freaking one!
[06:49.250 --> 06:50.370]  I'm trying!
[06:52.530 --> 06:53.690]  I wanna try harder.
[06:54.530 --> 06:57.990]  He sent me a new link, and I opened it, and it was already all clicked in.
[06:58.390 --> 07:04.110]  I can't believe this fucking same stream is happening twice today.
[07:05.730 --> 07:10.030]  We got freaking 2,500 people clicking on my card!
[07:10.230 --> 07:14.530]  I want it known that I've taken Car Underglow off my board.
[07:14.730 --> 07:15.970]  I've removed it officially.
[07:16.290 --> 07:17.410]  That's no longer there.
[07:17.890 --> 07:19.350]  The game has not started.
[07:21.710 --> 07:24.630]  I mean, it would have been fine. I just can't do anything with mine.
[07:24.710 --> 07:25.950]  I got a blackout once.
[07:26.730 --> 07:27.530]  One second.
[07:27.530 --> 07:28.590]  One second.
[07:31.030 --> 07:35.030]  I did not think this would be a group activity on my...
[07:35.030 --> 07:35.890]  Neither did I!
[07:36.670 --> 07:42.030]  I swear to fucking God, you guys are gonna kill me with laughter this week.
[07:42.090 --> 07:46.630]  I don't know what it is about this specific week, but motherfucker.
[07:47.790 --> 07:49.610]  We just missed a guy falling off a bike.
[07:50.530 --> 07:50.790]  Did we?
[07:51.850 --> 07:53.110]  Oh, my eyes were closed.
[07:53.110 --> 07:57.310]  I almost fell off my chair trying to keep up with unclicking my card.
[07:57.370 --> 07:58.730]  I was practicing breathing.
[07:58.870 --> 07:59.730]  Oh, God.
[08:00.010 --> 08:01.570]  I'm just waiting for Andrew to send me another one.
[08:01.850 --> 08:03.430]  Why did you share screenshots?
[08:04.790 --> 08:06.610]  Because then you couldn't click on them.
[08:07.150 --> 08:10.310]  No, not with us, you doofuses.
[08:10.670 --> 08:12.830]  With the audience.
[08:13.290 --> 08:14.010]  You morons.
[08:14.390 --> 08:16.070]  You fucking numbskulls.
[08:16.350 --> 08:17.910]  Jesus fucking Christ.
[08:18.010 --> 08:18.930]  Are you kidding me?
[08:18.930 --> 08:20.170]  You think...
[08:20.170 --> 08:22.410]  Are you out of your minds?
[08:22.630 --> 08:24.930]  Are you Andrew? What's wrong with you?
[08:26.050 --> 08:27.530]  Think for one second.
[08:27.750 --> 08:29.330]  Stop when I say something.
[08:29.550 --> 08:30.870]  Stop for one second.
[08:31.270 --> 08:33.790]  Think about the words and what you're about to say.
[08:33.990 --> 08:34.970]  And consider...
[08:34.970 --> 08:36.270]  Is this right?
[08:37.470 --> 08:38.610]  I thought it was right.
[08:39.090 --> 08:40.790]  That felt right for me to say that then.
[08:40.890 --> 08:41.330]  It was wrong.
[08:41.570 --> 08:43.810]  I agree, Gavin. It felt right. It felt real right.
[08:44.570 --> 08:46.970]  Judging by Eric's response, I think it was.
[08:46.970 --> 08:49.090]  I think it was definitely right.
[08:50.490 --> 08:51.370]  Oh, man.
[08:51.450 --> 08:52.090]  What a great day.
[08:52.430 --> 08:54.470]  That's the second hardest doofus I've heard in a week.
[08:54.730 --> 08:55.470]  Oh, yeah.
[08:57.530 --> 08:58.570]  Oh, holy shit.
[08:59.130 --> 08:59.950]  Oh, my lord.
[09:00.910 --> 09:01.770]  I'm having a good time.
[09:01.890 --> 09:03.110]  Those ladies are all dressed the same.
[09:04.610 --> 09:04.890]  Man.
[09:05.350 --> 09:08.170]  I'm missing out on half of my card here.
[09:08.510 --> 09:09.850]  Well, the game hasn't started yet.
[09:10.470 --> 09:15.110]  We finally got Andrew to take car underglow off his thing, so we're good.
[09:15.110 --> 09:21.210]  Hey, thank you to the 2777 of you that are watching this right now. We really appreciate it.
[09:21.310 --> 09:23.250]  Yeah, sorry it's a mess.
[09:24.010 --> 09:27.770]  Who here in the chat was there for the falcon draft that we did?
[09:28.370 --> 09:29.770]  Oh, yeah, where the falcon's at?
[09:30.310 --> 09:31.090]  Where the falcon's at?
[09:34.090 --> 09:34.570]  Yeah!
[09:35.630 --> 09:36.110]  Yeah!
[09:36.770 --> 09:37.030]  Okay.
[09:38.390 --> 09:39.350]  Hey, Gavin?
[09:40.150 --> 09:44.370]  I think what you do is click on like the...
[09:44.370 --> 09:47.750]  I'm on my phone doing it, and it's like the three hash marks.
[09:48.630 --> 09:49.730]  Somebody wrote bird noises.
[09:49.930 --> 09:54.190]  And then you go to new, and it'll generate a card that I think only you can see.
[09:54.510 --> 09:56.950]  Because I just did it, and mine isn't going crazy anymore.
[09:56.970 --> 09:57.490]  Look at this guy.
[09:58.770 --> 09:59.410]  Oh, I'm free!
[09:59.770 --> 10:01.010]  I'm free from the clicking.
[10:01.170 --> 10:02.390]  Okay, we're free. Okay, cool.
[10:02.530 --> 10:03.370]  Look at this guy.
[10:04.950 --> 10:07.830]  Everyone, thank you so much for subscribing.
[10:08.230 --> 10:08.610]  Yeah, we're busy.
[10:09.370 --> 10:11.430]  Thanks for putting up with this.
[10:11.430 --> 10:13.150]  And you're welcome.
[10:13.390 --> 10:13.990]  Yeah.
[10:15.190 --> 10:17.450]  Okay, I have a usable card now.
[10:17.610 --> 10:18.590]  Oh, hell yeah.
[10:18.630 --> 10:20.390]  You're welcome, man.
[10:20.590 --> 10:21.910]  I'm sorry?
[10:23.370 --> 10:25.930]  Oh, there's crosswalk towers!
[10:26.130 --> 10:27.170]  Oh, it started!
[10:27.810 --> 10:29.370]  Almost got hit by a car.
[10:29.790 --> 10:31.570]  That's such a rare one to get.
[10:31.970 --> 10:33.070]  Oh, I have it too.
[10:33.530 --> 10:33.990]  Right there.
[10:35.210 --> 10:36.450]  I have it as well.
[10:37.290 --> 10:39.570]  So, if there's falcons
[10:39.570 --> 10:41.350]  in the chat,
[10:41.690 --> 10:42.710]  you know what we did.
[10:43.390 --> 10:44.990]  You know about what we drafted.
[10:45.170 --> 10:47.590]  There was a lot of falcon influence in the draft.
[10:47.930 --> 10:48.930]  Not just the terms,
[10:49.170 --> 10:50.810]  but which things we should draft when.
[10:51.190 --> 10:53.410]  Because it started getting real thin
[10:53.410 --> 10:54.110]  near the end.
[10:54.610 --> 10:56.050]  That was on the fence about entering.
[10:56.470 --> 10:58.510]  They looked at it, they evaluated it, they were like,
[10:58.590 --> 11:00.150]  fuck that. That's on the fence.
[11:00.870 --> 11:02.450]  Dog and Hog went wild.
[11:02.710 --> 11:03.890]  Excited to see that one.
[11:05.050 --> 11:07.470]  I think we're close enough to slop a clock.
[11:07.470 --> 11:09.730]  How are you guys feeling? Are you ready to get going
[11:09.730 --> 11:10.790]  on this or what?
[11:11.070 --> 11:12.310]  Pretty ready.
[11:14.390 --> 11:15.890]  Andrew, how are you feeling?
[11:16.330 --> 11:17.350]  I'm ready. Let's go.
[11:17.850 --> 11:19.670]  Alright guys, Sloppy Joe's
[11:19.670 --> 11:20.850]  bingo begins
[11:21.390 --> 11:23.410]  in 3, 2,
[11:24.550 --> 11:25.510]  1, now.
[11:26.910 --> 11:27.870]  Hell yeah!
[11:28.350 --> 11:29.310]  Let me take a look at my car.
[11:30.530 --> 11:31.910]  Almost got hit by a car.
[11:32.810 --> 11:33.470]  Nick, could you go ahead
[11:33.470 --> 11:35.230]  and rewind the stream about 6 minutes?
[11:36.490 --> 11:37.510]  I'm afraid I can't do that.
[11:37.510 --> 11:39.250]  Do any of these people have a sweet
[11:39.630 --> 11:41.370]  stash? Not yet. What about that guy's
[11:41.370 --> 11:43.170]  head sheen, Gavin? That guy's got some head sheen.
[11:44.630 --> 11:45.470]  I'll give it to you.
[11:45.550 --> 11:46.150]  That's head sheen.
[11:46.330 --> 11:47.810]  That's 100% head sheen.
[11:48.950 --> 11:50.510]  That's a great spot on my new board.
[11:51.790 --> 11:52.810]  That's a new one as well.
[11:54.250 --> 11:55.350]  What's this guy got in his hand
[11:55.350 --> 11:57.110]  as he's crossing the street? He's not gonna drop it.
[11:57.910 --> 11:59.030]  Looking for some litter bug here.
[11:59.030 --> 12:00.490]  Oh, there's a tricycle.
[12:00.830 --> 12:03.190]  I'm gonna mark that off. That's two for Geoff.
[12:03.190 --> 12:03.810]  Wow.
[12:03.950 --> 12:06.330]  I have drafted poorly it seems.
[12:06.590 --> 12:08.370]  That's the way it goes, man. It's hard.
[12:09.030 --> 12:10.930]  I've drafted well, but we did not start
[12:10.930 --> 12:11.590]  immediately.
[12:12.390 --> 12:13.970]  We've never started immediately.
[12:14.650 --> 12:16.930]  Doing this, we've never started immediately.
[12:17.670 --> 12:18.650]  That's also true, though.
[12:18.970 --> 12:19.450]  We've never started.
[12:19.830 --> 12:21.170]  Cop car!
[12:23.410 --> 12:24.330]  That's never happened.
[12:25.370 --> 12:26.710]  I'm so excited about my cake.
[12:27.290 --> 12:28.250]  That's underglow.
[12:28.690 --> 12:30.730]  If you got it.
[12:30.730 --> 12:32.730]  We can only get
[12:32.730 --> 12:33.390]  two things.
[12:33.810 --> 12:36.290]  Each one of these items.
[12:36.870 --> 12:37.590]  That was a sweet stash.
[12:38.890 --> 12:40.530]  Only two people could draft
[12:40.530 --> 12:41.430]  onto their board.
[12:42.310 --> 12:44.870]  Street cop, only two of us could get.
[12:45.510 --> 12:45.910]  Dancing.
[12:46.390 --> 12:47.030]  Dancing.
[12:48.710 --> 12:49.270]  This is good.
[12:50.350 --> 12:52.670]  Does the Boston Bruins t-shirt
[12:52.670 --> 12:53.590]  count as a jersey?
[12:53.870 --> 12:54.230]  No.
[12:55.390 --> 12:58.170]  That guy acknowledged the camera.
[12:58.170 --> 12:59.150]  If anybody has that.
[12:59.910 --> 13:00.750]  He pointed at it, yeah.
[13:03.970 --> 13:05.590]  Deciding to go in? He didn't go in.
[13:07.530 --> 13:08.470]  This is gonna go fast.
[13:09.890 --> 13:11.210]  That famous last words.
[13:11.870 --> 13:12.910]  We might have to clear the board.
[13:13.670 --> 13:14.650]  And now we'll sit here forever.
[13:16.310 --> 13:16.970]  You're welcome.
[13:17.630 --> 13:18.330]  There's Sheen again.
[13:18.550 --> 13:21.250]  Oh, is that sunglasses at night?
[13:21.550 --> 13:22.070]  I can't tell.
[13:24.550 --> 13:25.430]  Regular specs.
[13:27.230 --> 13:27.610]  American
[13:27.610 --> 13:29.030]  flag clothes, please.
[13:29.090 --> 13:31.390]  Can I get a handshake?
[13:31.490 --> 13:32.750]  Guys on the phone?
[13:33.130 --> 13:35.610]  That guy has a flag on his shirt.
[13:36.190 --> 13:37.490]  Where? Oh, it is American flag
[13:37.490 --> 13:37.810]  clothing.
[13:39.850 --> 13:40.770]  Where is that?
[13:44.250 --> 13:45.330]  Somebody drop something.
[13:48.070 --> 13:48.970]  That's a litter bug.
[13:49.350 --> 13:49.970]  That's a litter bug.
[13:51.810 --> 13:52.190]  Absolutely.
[13:52.190 --> 13:54.450]  In front of thousands of people.
[13:54.650 --> 13:55.930]  This is popping off.
[13:58.270 --> 14:00.250]  Somebody kick off your
[14:00.930 --> 14:01.410]  sandals.
[14:03.250 --> 14:03.890]  Dickhead truck.
[14:04.130 --> 14:04.970]  Litter asshole.
[14:05.430 --> 14:08.570]  I think it's a normal truck.
[14:10.250 --> 14:12.250]  I saw a truck
[14:12.250 --> 14:14.250]  earlier that made me go, oh, dude, dickhead truck
[14:14.250 --> 14:16.310]  is fucking easy. When we see it, we'll see it.
[14:16.650 --> 14:18.430]  Guy has a wrap around his ankle.
[14:18.750 --> 14:19.450]  Bandage guy?
[14:19.450 --> 14:20.110]  I have bandage.
[14:21.110 --> 14:22.150]  That counts.
[14:24.530 --> 14:25.530]  What's that shirt say?
[14:26.730 --> 14:27.690]  Van Halen.
[14:28.270 --> 14:29.610]  It's a mullet.
[14:30.310 --> 14:31.710]  That's a great mullet.
[14:31.730 --> 14:32.950]  That's a hard mullet, Gavin.
[14:33.250 --> 14:35.230]  And a sweet stash, I would say.
[14:36.090 --> 14:37.730]  I think those
[14:37.730 --> 14:38.670]  are probably going to be combos.
[14:40.230 --> 14:41.670]  We should have the reverse
[14:41.670 --> 14:43.190]  of an overloaded golf cart
[14:43.190 --> 14:44.970]  with not nearly enough people
[14:44.970 --> 14:45.910]  for how many seats.
[14:47.450 --> 14:47.910]  That's
[14:47.910 --> 14:49.310]  one person
[14:49.740 --> 14:51.110]  in a friendless golfer.
[14:51.410 --> 14:51.870]  Oh,
[14:53.990 --> 14:54.810]  shades on the back of it, man.
[14:55.050 --> 14:57.090]  We should add that.
[14:57.850 --> 14:59.830]  That guy had shades on that, but he took
[14:59.830 --> 15:00.810]  them off right at the last minute.
[15:02.910 --> 15:03.370]  Oh,
[15:03.730 --> 15:04.970]  no, that's a utility truck.
[15:05.090 --> 15:06.110]  That's a work truck.
[15:07.290 --> 15:08.650]  That's a dickhead truck.
[15:09.050 --> 15:09.210]  No.
[15:11.970 --> 15:12.710]  I'm sorry.
[15:13.210 --> 15:14.190]  Look at it.
[15:14.230 --> 15:16.830]  From further away,
[15:16.990 --> 15:18.270]  it looked like a dickhead truck.
[15:18.530 --> 15:20.310]  It was like perspective dickhead.
[15:23.030 --> 15:25.030]  A dickhead is all about perspective.
[15:27.010 --> 15:28.030]  Somebody get in a fight.
[15:29.830 --> 15:30.950]  That was a crazy pick.
[15:31.350 --> 15:32.290]  That was a crazy pick.
[15:32.590 --> 15:35.430]  I don't think that's a cowboy hat.
[15:35.630 --> 15:36.190]  That's a dumb hat.
[15:36.430 --> 15:37.970]  That was a Jason Mraz hat.
[15:39.450 --> 15:41.130]  Jason Mraz hat's a dumb hat, right?
[15:41.130 --> 15:41.670]  No.
[15:42.570 --> 15:43.570]  It's just a hat.
[15:44.870 --> 15:46.490]  It's just a hat hat.
[15:47.870 --> 15:48.690]  Chug, you little bitch.
[15:49.130 --> 15:49.590]  He's not chugging.
[15:50.670 --> 15:52.010]  Shades! Sunglasses at night!
[15:52.290 --> 15:53.170]  Sunglasses at night.
[15:55.090 --> 15:57.430]  I need crosswalk coward and cowboy boots, baby.
[15:57.830 --> 15:58.450]  I'm looking at feet.
[15:58.690 --> 15:59.730]  I'm like Nick, I'm staring at feet.
[16:02.750 --> 16:05.170]  If I almost get hit by a car, I win.
[16:05.370 --> 16:05.710]  Oh, shit.
[16:07.190 --> 16:07.830]  Oh, man.
[16:07.830 --> 16:08.670]  Oh, shit, oh, man.
[16:08.930 --> 16:11.330]  Is that Mustang a luxury car?
[16:11.590 --> 16:12.310]  Nah, she's not.
[16:13.230 --> 16:15.750]  Yeah, it's a convertible Mustang.
[16:16.130 --> 16:16.950]  I'd say probably.
[16:17.430 --> 16:19.950]  I heard that you would know a luxury car
[16:19.950 --> 16:21.430]  when you saw one, and that's why you picked it.
[16:21.430 --> 16:22.270]  And I don't know that.
[16:22.550 --> 16:23.490]  Maybe I'll put that to the chat.
[16:23.570 --> 16:26.230]  Hey, was that convertible Mustang a luxury car, chat?
[16:26.530 --> 16:28.090]  I'm comfortable with it being no.
[16:28.490 --> 16:30.990]  What would you describe this hat as?
[16:31.810 --> 16:33.850]  Well, it seems to be a unanimous no
[16:33.850 --> 16:35.830]  from many people.
[16:36.310 --> 16:37.790]  That's just a Jason Mraz hat.
[16:37.830 --> 16:40.750]  I don't think that's like a crazy dumb hat.
[16:40.850 --> 16:41.790]  I think that's just like...
[16:41.790 --> 16:44.450]  But Jason Mraz looks a lot cooler in it than, say, this guy.
[16:44.590 --> 16:46.510]  Well, yeah, this guy looks like Gilligan,
[16:46.670 --> 16:47.530]  but I think it's...
[16:47.530 --> 16:49.570]  Therefore, it is a dumb hat.
[16:49.650 --> 16:50.970]  Dickhead truck. That's a dickhead truck.
[16:51.370 --> 16:52.410]  Bad dickhead truck.
[16:55.130 --> 16:56.550]  Normal hat on a dumb guy
[16:56.550 --> 16:57.590]  doesn't make it a dumb hat.
[16:57.730 --> 16:59.070]  There you go. Thank you.
[16:59.350 --> 16:59.730]  Damn.
[17:00.730 --> 17:02.510]  Sorry, but, you know...
[17:02.510 --> 17:04.530]  What about the transitive property, Geoff?
[17:04.630 --> 17:04.950]  Come on.
[17:06.830 --> 17:08.250]  More kids out late.
[17:08.910 --> 17:09.430]  More hashing.
[17:10.070 --> 17:12.370]  Not a lot of camera acknowledgement.
[17:13.470 --> 17:13.590]  No.
[17:13.770 --> 17:15.470]  Nobody trying to get in the wrong car.
[17:15.610 --> 17:17.070]  Nobody's almost getting hit by a car.
[17:17.190 --> 17:18.850]  That'd be really convenient if they did.
[17:19.570 --> 17:21.150]  Whoa, she's not hoofing it.
[17:21.290 --> 17:22.930]  I don't think she's hoofing it. She's dancing.
[17:23.250 --> 17:24.690]  That was like a pretend hoofing it.
[17:25.630 --> 17:26.990]  Believe me, I have hoofing it, too.
[17:27.050 --> 17:30.130]  I would love to claim it, but...
[17:31.880 --> 17:34.200]  We're so locked in.
[17:34.400 --> 17:35.800]  So fucking locked in.
[17:36.660 --> 17:38.900]  It's a bad time of year for jeans and flip-flops, I think.
[17:38.960 --> 17:40.060]  I think that was a bad pick by me.
[17:40.580 --> 17:41.560]  I'm right there with you.
[17:41.960 --> 17:44.380]  Has the camera moved? I don't think so.
[17:44.740 --> 17:45.740]  It seems the same.
[17:46.960 --> 17:47.260]  No.
[17:48.320 --> 17:50.060]  Oh, is that a fanny pack?
[17:50.940 --> 17:51.420]  Uh, yes.
[17:52.180 --> 17:53.840]  Oh, no, it's a purse. I'm sorry.
[17:55.100 --> 17:58.600]  It is in such a great spot to be a fanny pack.
[17:59.580 --> 18:01.860]  It's in such a great spot to be a fanny pack.
[18:01.860 --> 18:03.660]  You know all about that.
[18:05.220 --> 18:08.380]  If she swings it around towards her fanny, is it a fanny pack?
[18:09.500 --> 18:10.540]  Sweet umbrella.
[18:12.140 --> 18:13.300]  What the fuck?
[18:13.720 --> 18:15.660]  Was that matching shorts?
[18:15.900 --> 18:16.440]  Is it raining?
[18:16.700 --> 18:18.700]  Oh, it might be. It is raining.
[18:19.380 --> 18:22.540]  I thought it looked wet, but I didn't.
[18:22.800 --> 18:24.620]  I'm like, oh, I guess it's just really wet out.
[18:25.860 --> 18:27.860]  The flip from what a weirdo
[18:27.860 --> 18:30.160]  to the most reasonable man in the world.
[18:30.160 --> 18:30.780]  Yeah.
[18:33.380 --> 18:34.440]  What are you fucking...
[18:34.440 --> 18:35.020]  Oh, right, yeah.
[18:35.120 --> 18:35.600]  Oh, you're right.
[18:38.920 --> 18:40.360]  Where was double fisting?
[18:40.440 --> 18:41.360]  Someone said double fisting.
[18:41.460 --> 18:42.040]  Fuck, I missed it.
[18:42.360 --> 18:44.380]  We didn't see it. It's not official.
[18:45.720 --> 18:47.500]  I like when people say formal attire
[18:47.500 --> 18:49.000]  and nothing is formal on the screen.
[18:50.140 --> 18:51.060]  It's so great.
[18:51.280 --> 18:53.340]  When it's just like they're so wrong, it's the best.
[18:54.440 --> 18:56.700]  Come on, almost get hit by a car, anybody.
[18:57.020 --> 18:57.380]  Are those sandals?
[18:57.380 --> 18:59.040]  No, or is that cowboy?
[18:59.240 --> 18:59.880]  No, fuck.
[19:00.740 --> 19:01.920]  Cowboy hat would be cool.
[19:03.580 --> 19:05.080]  I'm just looking for a dumb hat.
[19:05.500 --> 19:06.020]  What's on your hat?
[19:06.040 --> 19:08.500]  That woman was in jeans and sandals.
[19:09.220 --> 19:10.320]  Wait, really? Yeah.
[19:10.520 --> 19:13.060]  I don't have it, but that's good.
[19:13.300 --> 19:13.700]  I thought I did.
[19:17.120 --> 19:17.520]  Nick!
[19:18.920 --> 19:20.280]  I'm refreshing, I'm refreshing.
[19:21.320 --> 19:22.900]  Nick, we believe in you, dude.
[19:23.140 --> 19:24.320]  You're good. I got it.
[19:24.320 --> 19:26.900]  The closest one I forgot to put on the list
[19:26.900 --> 19:29.540]  is Nick having the stream freeze
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.560]  and needing to refresh it.
[19:33.340 --> 19:33.740]  Bingo.
[19:34.680 --> 19:35.820]  That's not for real.
[19:36.140 --> 19:37.580]  I've not had an eye out for fist bumps.
[19:37.920 --> 19:40.500]  I haven't had an eye out for handshakes either.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.120]  Oh, you know, that's a good one
[19:43.120 --> 19:45.040]  we could add is getting directions.
[19:45.960 --> 19:46.720]  Oh, that's a good one.
[19:46.800 --> 19:47.760]  Because that happens a couple times a night.
[19:47.920 --> 19:49.660]  There's a dickhead truck and ground effects.
[19:50.900 --> 19:52.640]  If somebody had ground effects,
[19:52.640 --> 19:53.280]  that was there.
[19:54.440 --> 19:56.120]  Man, I'm still looking for a hog and a dog.
[19:57.980 --> 19:58.600]  There's jeans
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.820]  and sandals again, guys.
[20:00.800 --> 20:02.300]  I'm also looking for hog and a dog.
[20:02.760 --> 20:03.220]  Hell yeah.
[20:05.920 --> 20:06.320]  Everyone
[20:06.840 --> 20:08.280]  assured me in the chat.
[20:08.420 --> 20:10.760]  Oh, dude, obviously dyed hair is such
[20:10.760 --> 20:12.260]  that's like a lock-in.
[20:12.380 --> 20:14.700]  That's such a lock-in. That's so easy.
[20:14.920 --> 20:16.300]  And I listened to the Falcons.
[20:16.660 --> 20:18.320]  Was it to my own detriment? Could be.
[20:18.460 --> 20:19.220]  We'll find out soon.
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.220]  You know what? Hey, it's raining.
[20:21.360 --> 20:22.180]  Might have washed it out.
[20:22.540 --> 20:24.360]  Great point, Nick.
[20:24.560 --> 20:27.680]  And that's how it works. Great point, Nick.
[20:28.040 --> 20:29.200]  My bunk got colors.
[20:30.820 --> 20:31.200]  Oh, no.
[20:33.360 --> 20:34.820]  I want to go to Key West, man.
[20:35.620 --> 20:37.480]  Like, seeing this again makes me want to go.
[20:38.120 --> 20:38.940]  Oh, is that Popo?
[20:39.940 --> 20:40.340]  No.
[20:41.440 --> 20:42.700]  He just sucks.
[20:43.180 --> 20:45.300]  Oh, I looked like he was shaking hands or something.
[20:45.840 --> 20:46.120]  Tough.
[20:47.520 --> 20:48.360]  Hey, guys.
[20:48.600 --> 20:50.500]  Great hype train in the chat for Twitch.
[20:50.600 --> 20:52.760]  Thank you so much. We really appreciate you guys so much.
[20:53.040 --> 20:54.040]  Three thousand people.
[20:54.200 --> 20:54.760]  Holy hell.
[20:56.040 --> 20:57.740]  I was just...
[20:57.740 --> 20:59.840]  Oh, is that a luxury car right there?
[20:59.980 --> 21:00.480]  Is that a Porsche?
[21:01.500 --> 21:02.000]  What is that?
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.540]  Panamara or whatever?
[21:06.160 --> 21:08.100]  I don't know. You guys said that you would know
[21:08.100 --> 21:08.700]  immediately.
[21:09.520 --> 21:10.080]  That is true.
[21:10.920 --> 21:14.300]  You said you would make the call.
[21:14.300 --> 21:15.600]  That is a luxury vehicle.
[21:15.920 --> 21:17.260]  I don't think it's a Porsche, though.
[21:17.560 --> 21:18.040]  Isn't it?
[21:19.600 --> 21:22.220]  I think it's a Panamara. Is that what it's called?
[21:22.740 --> 21:23.720]  A tricycle just went by.
[21:24.360 --> 21:24.540]  Yeah.
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.760]  It's definitely a luxury vehicle.
[21:27.760 --> 21:28.620]  What do you think, chat?
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.960]  The chat says it's a Hyundai Genesis.
[21:31.140 --> 21:32.360]  Oh, no. Never mind.
[21:35.400 --> 21:37.020]  Dude, I'll know it when I see it.
[21:37.220 --> 21:38.440]  And I'll make that call.
[21:38.700 --> 21:40.300]  Genesis is a nice car, though.
[21:40.300 --> 21:42.040]  Genesis is a nice car, but I'm not going to call it a luxury.
[21:42.040 --> 21:43.960]  Yeah, I drive an Accent. It's not that far off.
[21:44.860 --> 21:46.220]  That car was nice, whatever that was.
[21:46.280 --> 21:46.980]  Don't, don't, don't.
[21:47.360 --> 21:47.720]  Fuck.
[21:48.820 --> 21:52.200]  I need a scooter gang, baby.
[21:52.520 --> 21:53.320]  Hoofing it, hoofing it.
[21:54.440 --> 21:55.380]  Yeah, that's hoofing it.
[21:56.300 --> 21:56.740]  I'll take that.
[21:58.720 --> 21:59.920]  I'm sucking on this.
[22:00.180 --> 22:01.200]  Yeah, this is tough, man.
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.740]  I need the Meemaws and the Peepaws.
[22:03.620 --> 22:06.200]  Here's the thing, Gavin. I think our original cards
[22:06.200 --> 22:07.780]  were probably really, really, really good.
[22:07.780 --> 22:08.760]  And then Andrew
[22:09.620 --> 22:11.700]  made sure it got
[22:11.700 --> 22:12.100]  fucked.
[22:12.720 --> 22:15.500]  What would be another good one to add?
[22:15.680 --> 22:17.040]  Topknot for dudes.
[22:17.600 --> 22:17.880]  Oh, yeah.
[22:19.260 --> 22:21.100]  But I feel like I don't see that a ton.
[22:22.080 --> 22:23.500]  You don't want them all to be easy.
[22:23.960 --> 22:25.700]  I'm worried that the
[22:25.700 --> 22:27.400]  rain is going to eliminate hugs.
[22:28.260 --> 22:29.900]  That people are not going to hug
[22:29.900 --> 22:30.560]  with the wet.
[22:30.880 --> 22:33.720]  Interestingly enough, though, it might
[22:33.720 --> 22:34.740]  boost fist bumps.
[22:35.520 --> 22:36.400]  That is true.
[22:37.080 --> 22:38.380]  I'm invested in both.
[22:38.980 --> 22:40.140]  American flag shorts.
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.420]  And a mullet.
[22:42.940 --> 22:43.160]  Wow.
[22:44.460 --> 22:46.480]  He's wearing a headband, too. There's a lot going on.
[22:47.200 --> 22:48.640]  Oh, that guy kind of looked like Lannan.
[22:48.740 --> 22:49.760]  Is that a celebrity sighting?
[22:51.240 --> 22:52.040]  Celebrity lookalike?
[22:53.240 --> 22:54.640]  No, it's Lannan.
[22:55.400 --> 22:56.620]  A little like if Lannan got a flame.
[22:57.020 --> 22:58.880]  It's Lannan, just that kid that's
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.620]  10 billion times more famous
[23:00.620 --> 23:01.260]  than any of us.
[23:01.260 --> 23:02.120]  Yeah, he's famous as hell.
[23:02.300 --> 23:03.940]  He's famous as shit, dude.
[23:04.220 --> 23:06.860]  Ryan Reynolds movie.
[23:08.100 --> 23:08.800]  Oh, Ghost Tour.
[23:10.240 --> 23:10.960]  Ghost Tour.
[23:11.780 --> 23:12.940]  Some of y'all got that, right?
[23:13.280 --> 23:13.740]  I got that one.
[23:13.980 --> 23:16.260]  This is unprecedented.
[23:17.300 --> 23:17.660]  Unprecedented.
[23:18.740 --> 23:20.160]  We never get that shit this early.
[23:21.880 --> 23:22.560]  I will say,
[23:23.380 --> 23:25.440]  topknot guy is overstaying his welcome.
[23:26.240 --> 23:27.080]  Yeah, he needs to fuck off.
[23:27.140 --> 23:27.900]  He needs to get out of here.
[23:27.900 --> 23:29.540]  Yeah, but he's not like
[23:30.820 --> 23:31.860]  openly camera-ing.
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.660]  If he was by himself,
[23:33.820 --> 23:35.700]  I'd agree, but I think because there's
[23:35.700 --> 23:37.660]  three of them, it makes it more permissible.
[23:38.160 --> 23:38.880]  You're right.
[23:40.200 --> 23:41.960]  I want them to move along.
[23:42.040 --> 23:42.740]  Does that count?
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.380]  He's waving at the camera.
[23:47.320 --> 23:49.480]  What you can maybe argue soon, Eric,
[23:49.520 --> 23:50.960]  is that all three of them should go.
[23:51.460 --> 23:53.060]  I already think they should go.
[23:53.200 --> 23:54.940]  I told you guys when I picked that,
[23:54.940 --> 23:57.360]  that I was going to have the shortest amount of patience for it.
[23:57.480 --> 23:57.680]  Yeah.
[23:58.800 --> 24:00.460]  She's strutting her shit. Look at that.
[24:00.900 --> 24:01.400]  Dancing hard.
[24:01.780 --> 24:02.940]  That's formal, that dress.
[24:03.100 --> 24:08.440]  What are you in the fucking chat?
[24:08.620 --> 24:09.460]  Get real.
[24:09.840 --> 24:13.060]  I'm going to have to throw out a few of those
[24:13.060 --> 24:13.980]  because I want that one to happen.
[24:15.180 --> 24:15.860]  Oh, I see.
[24:16.660 --> 24:17.580]  Handshake, please.
[24:18.680 --> 24:19.740]  Yeah, I'd take a handshake.
[24:21.100 --> 24:23.060]  Wouldn't mind a beach goth.
[24:23.060 --> 24:24.340]  High five, yawning.
[24:26.880 --> 24:27.880]  Maybe a t-shirt.
[24:28.100 --> 24:30.080]  Look at those hats.
[24:31.280 --> 24:32.300]  I need a hug.
[24:32.320 --> 24:33.500]  I just need a hug.
[24:35.180 --> 24:36.580]  A lot of people in the chat say
[24:36.580 --> 24:37.800]  they look pretty damn formal.
[24:38.480 --> 24:40.840]  Yeah, and why are you listening to them?
[24:41.400 --> 24:42.420]  Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[24:44.060 --> 24:45.380]  That's a bachelorette party.
[24:46.240 --> 24:46.720]  Where?
[24:47.300 --> 24:48.360]  Right in front of us?
[24:48.480 --> 24:49.820]  With the hat and everything?
[24:49.820 --> 24:50.700]  Are you serious?
[24:50.960 --> 24:52.900]  You don't think that's a bachelorette party?
[24:53.160 --> 24:55.200]  You don't think that's a bachelorette party?
[24:55.880 --> 24:56.560]  Is that a dumb hat?
[24:57.060 --> 24:59.160]  Ask the chat. Get real.
[25:01.380 --> 25:02.620]  Is that a dumb hat?
[25:03.960 --> 25:05.440]  Is that a pawpaw and a meemaw?
[25:05.500 --> 25:07.780]  I don't think it's a dumb hat, but would you count that as
[25:07.780 --> 25:08.400]  matching?
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.140]  Because they are wearing the same
[25:12.140 --> 25:12.860]  style of hat.
[25:13.380 --> 25:14.460]  It's a matching outfit.
[25:15.040 --> 25:15.540]  That's true.
[25:15.540 --> 25:16.220]  You're right.
[25:17.260 --> 25:19.700]  Hey Gavin, that's a great point.
[25:20.320 --> 25:20.940]  I appreciate it.
[25:21.040 --> 25:24.040]  You gotcha.
[25:24.780 --> 25:26.120]  Somebody said cowboy boots.
[25:26.440 --> 25:26.880]  Oh, they are.
[25:27.820 --> 25:28.860]  Thank you.
[25:29.120 --> 25:30.520]  There's a cowboy hat right there.
[25:32.320 --> 25:32.680]  What hat?
[25:33.540 --> 25:34.980]  Ladies walking at the bottom.
[25:35.660 --> 25:37.500]  Pretty formal looking cowgirl.
[25:38.540 --> 25:39.060]  No.
[25:40.260 --> 25:41.280]  Assassin's Creed right there.
[25:42.080 --> 25:43.440]  What does this dude's hat say?
[25:43.440 --> 25:44.220]  Is it stupid?
[25:44.660 --> 25:45.140]  Dumb?
[25:45.480 --> 25:46.100]  Dumb?
[25:48.680 --> 25:49.260]  He dumb.
[25:51.340 --> 25:53.640]  Come on, crosswalk coward.
[25:54.300 --> 25:55.460]  Don't get hit by a car.
[25:55.900 --> 25:56.660]  She crossed.
[25:57.700 --> 25:58.760]  She needed to turn around.
[25:59.220 --> 26:01.180]  She pulled that off.
[26:03.180 --> 26:05.940]  I need more cowardice on the streets.
[26:06.860 --> 26:07.140]  Yeah.
[26:09.420 --> 26:11.120]  Look at that long black dress.
[26:12.600 --> 26:13.860]  You cannot take that.
[26:14.080 --> 26:15.440]  Somebody said they saw a yawn.
[26:15.580 --> 26:16.080]  But I didn't see it.
[26:16.140 --> 26:18.300]  I saw a guy yawn.
[26:18.420 --> 26:20.360]  I have it.
[26:24.920 --> 26:26.240]  Gavin just approved it.
[26:26.440 --> 26:28.720]  You can do that.
[26:29.680 --> 26:31.040]  All I need is dog and a hog.
[26:31.760 --> 26:32.220]  Good luck.
[26:33.800 --> 26:34.960]  There's no dogs out.
[26:35.720 --> 26:36.720]  Settle in then.
[26:36.900 --> 26:38.320]  There's more dogs today.
[26:38.320 --> 26:39.700]  Is that old guy Pawpaw?
[26:40.140 --> 26:40.580]  No.
[26:41.100 --> 26:42.720]  That's just a regular old guy.
[26:44.120 --> 26:45.880]  He's going faster than this other guy.
[26:46.680 --> 26:47.340]  He's hauling.
[26:48.040 --> 26:48.900]  Is that old guy Pawpaw?
[26:50.720 --> 26:51.760]  I don't know.
[26:51.800 --> 26:52.680]  Is he dressed formal?
[26:54.180 --> 26:56.140]  Do you think he's a part of the bachelorette party?
[26:56.800 --> 26:58.000]  I've never won one of these.
[27:00.880 --> 27:02.300]  Long socks and shorts.
[27:03.140 --> 27:04.040]  It's the look now, dude.
[27:04.260 --> 27:04.820]  It's back.
[27:04.820 --> 27:06.000]  I hate it.
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.820]  I don't like it.
[27:08.640 --> 27:10.020]  It's just not the one I'm doing.
[27:10.140 --> 27:10.940]  I'm just not going for it.
[27:11.220 --> 27:13.040]  I don't get it.
[27:13.800 --> 27:15.440]  In this heat, nah.
[27:16.060 --> 27:17.700]  We had to do that shit.
[27:18.440 --> 27:21.300]  Gen X kids had to do that shit because that was the only option.
[27:21.840 --> 27:23.300]  Kids today have options.
[27:24.340 --> 27:26.100]  There's better socks available.
[27:28.760 --> 27:32.260]  I would like to know what formal is to Eric.
[27:32.360 --> 27:33.200]  It's not a sundress.
[27:34.500 --> 27:35.680]  Those are new boo-goofing.
[27:35.700 --> 27:37.560]  That is new boo-goofing over there, you guys.
[27:37.900 --> 27:38.040]  What?
[27:38.700 --> 27:41.060]  The ladies crossing the street
[27:41.060 --> 27:43.020]  with their brand new white boots.
[27:43.380 --> 27:44.100]  I don't even have them.
[27:44.740 --> 27:47.880]  That is exactly the spirit of it, so you guys can both mark that off.
[27:48.440 --> 27:49.760]  I think that's Andrew and Eric.
[27:49.940 --> 27:50.560]  Fuck me on that one.
[27:52.880 --> 27:54.560]  It's really annoying to see a security guard.
[27:56.480 --> 27:57.880]  Headshot isn't just boldness.
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.160]  You actually need to see the glare
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.300]  coming off the zombie head.
[28:00.300 --> 28:00.840]  Machine.
[28:02.140 --> 28:03.880]  You need to see the bounce back of the shine.
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.400]  Man, no one's going to be sitting on the street in this weather.
[28:06.740 --> 28:08.580]  Who's about to drop somebody off and pick somebody up?
[28:09.280 --> 28:10.320]  Get out. Get out. Get out.
[28:10.400 --> 28:11.240]  Get out. Get out. Get out.
[28:12.760 --> 28:14.240]  Deliver. Deliver. Deliver somebody.
[28:14.520 --> 28:14.920]  Deliver them.
[28:14.940 --> 28:17.280]  No. Deliver. Stop.
[28:18.120 --> 28:18.840]  Come on.
[28:20.520 --> 28:22.100]  From one LLC to another.
[28:23.800 --> 28:25.520]  Get in my car, please.
[28:25.940 --> 28:27.880]  Out in the crosswalk. Come on. Walk back. Walk back.
[28:27.880 --> 28:28.760]  Walk back. Walk back.
[28:29.260 --> 28:30.520]  Separate at the crosswalk.
[28:31.200 --> 28:33.080]  No! Not even.
[28:34.420 --> 28:35.180]  So close.
[28:35.200 --> 28:35.740]  They're not together.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.740]  Oh, they're not together.
[28:39.020 --> 28:40.980]  They walked to the crosswalk at the same time.
[28:41.080 --> 28:42.920]  I 100% thought they were together.
[28:43.720 --> 28:46.040]  That dude autopiloted across the street.
[28:46.400 --> 28:46.900]  He came back?
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.980]  That was almost a hug.
[28:48.120 --> 28:49.280]  Why did this guy come back?
[28:50.980 --> 28:52.600]  What's his shirt say?
[28:52.880 --> 28:54.200]  Oh, it's Buick.
[28:54.200 --> 28:55.460]  Damn. I thought it said fuck.
[29:01.220 --> 29:01.940]  Oh, crosswalk.
[29:02.480 --> 29:03.500]  He's going for it.
[29:03.540 --> 29:04.860]  He's going around. Smart.
[29:05.840 --> 29:07.900]  Dude, I want to see one of these assholes wipe out on a bike.
[29:08.940 --> 29:10.240]  It happened earlier.
[29:10.720 --> 29:12.700]  It was before we started when Andrew fucked our cards.
[29:13.340 --> 29:14.380]  Yeah, but I want to see it now.
[29:14.640 --> 29:16.040]  Oh, that guy's scratching his nuts.
[29:16.220 --> 29:16.820]  Yeah, he is.
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.300]  Oh, there he is.
[29:20.360 --> 29:20.900]  You're right.
[29:21.440 --> 29:22.240]  What is it?
[29:22.320 --> 29:23.780]  It's nuts, butts, and guts.
[29:24.820 --> 29:25.620]  Sunglasses at night!
[29:25.920 --> 29:27.620]  We already have that one.
[29:29.600 --> 29:30.300]  Fanny pack!
[29:31.940 --> 29:32.780]  Fanny pack!
[29:33.220 --> 29:33.720]  Fanny pack!
[29:34.900 --> 29:35.780]  Fanny pack!
[29:36.320 --> 29:39.220]  Eric, it was nose pick, wedgie pull, crotch grab, spit.
[29:39.440 --> 29:40.540]  Thank you. That was good.
[29:40.660 --> 29:41.860]  Did you have fanny pack, Nick?
[29:42.740 --> 29:43.240]  I sure did.
[29:44.420 --> 29:45.940]  Whatever Gavin celebrates.
[29:47.800 --> 29:49.180]  I forgot about that.
[29:49.180 --> 29:49.540]  You're right.
[29:50.660 --> 29:53.080]  Did we call a bachelorette party?
[29:53.460 --> 29:54.160]  Trip, dickhead.
[29:55.140 --> 29:57.400]  Do we say the bachelorette party already?
[29:57.560 --> 29:58.880]  Yeah, we said it.
[29:59.120 --> 30:01.080]  Oh, that looks like a pretty luxury...
[30:01.080 --> 30:02.620]  Nick is marking off so many things.
[30:03.000 --> 30:04.100]  He didn't fucking see.
[30:04.320 --> 30:07.260]  That is a luxury car.
[30:07.560 --> 30:09.660]  A Grand Wagoneer is a $100,000 car.
[30:09.740 --> 30:10.480]  That's a luxury car.
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.080]  Is it really? Holy shit.
[30:12.540 --> 30:14.400]  I mean, you said you would know.
[30:16.760 --> 30:17.780]  Someone said it was a G.
[30:19.240 --> 30:19.620]  Oh.
[30:19.820 --> 30:20.460]  It was a Wagoneer.
[30:20.980 --> 30:23.600]  I think we gotta set a rule that if you miss it,
[30:23.660 --> 30:25.160]  you can't mark it if someone says,
[30:25.240 --> 30:26.100]  yeah, that happened before.
[30:26.260 --> 30:28.640]  What the fuck?
[30:28.940 --> 30:29.420]  What is that?
[30:31.700 --> 30:32.940]  Is that on the list?
[30:33.160 --> 30:33.900]  Does that count as a skateboard?
[30:34.960 --> 30:35.900]  No, absolutely not.
[30:39.820 --> 30:42.500]  So, if it was a Wagoneer,
[30:42.720 --> 30:43.580]  then it's luxury,
[30:43.700 --> 30:44.760]  but a lot of people are saying it was a Jeep.
[30:45.020 --> 30:46.700]  It was a fucking Wagoneer.
[30:46.700 --> 30:47.940]  They might have been looking at a Jeep,
[30:48.080 --> 30:49.360]  but I looked at a Wagoneer.
[30:49.700 --> 30:51.820]  It was a fucking Wagoneer.
[30:51.940 --> 30:52.940]  We'll look at the tapes later.
[30:53.640 --> 30:55.700]  A $100,000 car isn't luxury.
[30:55.820 --> 30:56.520]  You guys are crazy.
[30:56.700 --> 30:59.620]  I tell you what. You're crazy.
[31:00.520 --> 31:02.400]  People are saying that Jeep is Wagoneer.
[31:02.980 --> 31:04.440]  Wagoneer is a Jeep brand.
[31:05.300 --> 31:05.560]  Oh, yeah.
[31:06.280 --> 31:07.840]  It's a classification of Jeep.
[31:09.860 --> 31:10.580]  A Grand Wagoneer
[31:10.580 --> 31:12.220]  is a fucking luxury car.
[31:12.380 --> 31:14.160]  I looked at one, and I couldn't afford it.
[31:14.160 --> 31:15.780]  Turn around.
[31:16.320 --> 31:16.560]  Damn it.
[31:17.740 --> 31:18.860]  That's a Meemaw pop off?
[31:19.040 --> 31:20.820]  No, they're close, though.
[31:20.900 --> 31:22.260]  They got another five years, and they will be.
[31:22.680 --> 31:26.200]  Kick your sandals off, fool.
[31:28.240 --> 31:29.820]  Just pop those shoes off, buddy.
[31:30.140 --> 31:32.120]  So few people
[31:32.120 --> 31:33.540]  have acknowledged the camera.
[31:34.620 --> 31:35.520]  I can't believe it.
[31:35.740 --> 31:36.860]  Chug, chug, chug.
[31:39.040 --> 31:40.400]  Chug, chug, chug.
[31:40.400 --> 31:40.920]  He chugged it.
[31:40.920 --> 31:41.440]  He chugged it.
[31:42.940 --> 31:43.020]  No.
[31:45.440 --> 31:46.160]  Damn it.
[31:46.840 --> 31:47.840]  That was close.
[31:48.280 --> 31:49.160]  I wanted it to.
[31:50.700 --> 31:51.760]  I wanted it for you.
[31:52.660 --> 31:54.600]  Oh, man. Somebody almost get hit by a car, please.
[31:55.580 --> 31:56.540]  It'll be game over.
[31:56.640 --> 31:58.340]  I'll be fucking dick deep in cake.
[31:59.640 --> 32:00.420]  I want cake.
[32:01.840 --> 32:02.440]  Come on, dog.
[32:02.560 --> 32:02.940]  Come on.
[32:03.000 --> 32:08.610]  A lot of people saying that was a chug,
[32:08.670 --> 32:09.530]  but I just don't think it was.
[32:09.530 --> 32:10.310]  I don't think it was.
[32:10.410 --> 32:12.210]  I don't know that he was chugging.
[32:12.290 --> 32:13.170]  I think it was a slow pour.
[32:16.190 --> 32:17.450]  Did we have pizza?
[32:17.590 --> 32:18.870]  There was a pizza going by.
[32:19.150 --> 32:19.910]  I don't remember this one.
[32:20.930 --> 32:22.810]  That dude had a giant box of pizza.
[32:24.350 --> 32:25.530]  Is that a hug?
[32:26.850 --> 32:27.190]  No.
[32:27.630 --> 32:28.430]  No, they're dancing.
[32:29.030 --> 32:31.470]  She put her arms around her neck and crossed them.
[32:31.670 --> 32:33.730]  Right, and they were dancing.
[32:34.530 --> 32:34.930]  Selfie?
[32:35.830 --> 32:36.230]  What?
[32:36.230 --> 32:37.050]  What?
[32:38.110 --> 32:39.110]  Are you okay?
[32:39.610 --> 32:41.430]  What happened to everyone just now?
[32:41.650 --> 32:42.630]  Are you guys alright?
[32:43.470 --> 32:44.170]  It was a leg chug.
[32:45.170 --> 32:46.350]  Yeah, she was chugging a leg.
[32:48.910 --> 32:49.910]  Let's get a fist bump.
[32:49.990 --> 32:50.450]  Let's get a hug.
[32:54.730 --> 32:56.290]  Nobody really wants to touch.
[32:56.470 --> 32:57.010]  Anyone else?
[32:57.350 --> 32:59.430]  I need some hugs.
[33:00.410 --> 33:00.770]  High five.
[33:01.250 --> 33:02.310]  Let's do some touching.
[33:03.310 --> 33:04.490]  Stop making
[33:04.490 --> 33:06.090]  the noises that you're making
[33:06.090 --> 33:08.310]  and then saying that fucking sentence.
[33:08.890 --> 33:09.950]  Who said what?
[33:11.890 --> 33:13.370]  Let's do some touching.
[33:13.570 --> 33:14.610]  What the fuck?
[33:15.370 --> 33:16.610]  It's not good.
[33:17.170 --> 33:17.850]  Not good.
[33:18.310 --> 33:19.250]  Shut up.
[33:20.150 --> 33:21.870]  Get out of that truck.
[33:22.010 --> 33:22.430]  Get out of the truck.
[33:22.590 --> 33:22.930]  Get out of the truck.
[33:27.230 --> 33:27.890]  Selfie.
[33:29.170 --> 33:29.830]  Please.
[33:29.830 --> 33:30.230]  Please.
[33:31.600 --> 33:33.610]  He wipes his hands on his butt.
[33:36.790 --> 33:39.550]  We need to add
[33:39.550 --> 33:40.470]  walk and stick.
[33:43.960 --> 33:45.200]  Where's the pink taxi?
[33:46.200 --> 33:46.700]  You wish.
[33:47.820 --> 33:48.360]  I'm gonna get one.
[33:48.520 --> 33:49.460]  No, Andrew, that's not a hug.
[33:51.200 --> 33:53.440]  Nick fucking adding on
[33:53.440 --> 33:55.240]  45 minutes after the fact.
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.220]  Are you okay?
[33:58.080 --> 33:59.140]  No, just now.
[33:59.140 --> 34:00.580]  Just now.
[34:01.160 --> 34:02.420]  Holding hands.
[34:02.840 --> 34:04.900]  I didn't even see one I'd consider a hug.
[34:05.500 --> 34:07.180]  It was just arm around shoulder.
[34:07.360 --> 34:08.080]  No, I have handshake.
[34:09.160 --> 34:11.480]  Maybe they weren't holding hands.
[34:11.580 --> 34:13.220]  Maybe it was a really slow handshake.
[34:13.660 --> 34:15.000]  Yeah, it wasn't.
[34:15.340 --> 34:15.560]  Yeah.
[34:16.940 --> 34:18.060]  American flag shirt.
[34:18.860 --> 34:20.960]  Someone get in that fucking taxi.
[34:21.100 --> 34:22.220]  Get in the taxi.
[34:23.740 --> 34:25.440]  Obviously dyed hair
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.060]  and sports jersey.
[34:27.820 --> 34:29.180]  I thought we're gonna be sure
[34:29.180 --> 34:29.640]  things.
[34:29.860 --> 34:31.580]  No dice.
[34:32.240 --> 34:34.400]  I really think the rain...
[34:34.400 --> 34:36.720]  I'm gonna check the weather report next time we do this.
[34:37.080 --> 34:38.220]  Because I think it's playing a factor.
[34:39.240 --> 34:40.020]  I think it is.
[34:40.380 --> 34:41.560]  I don't think it's raining right now.
[34:42.660 --> 34:44.560]  No, but I think it's affected the mood.
[34:44.800 --> 34:46.040]  Yeah, it's the vibe.
[34:46.220 --> 34:46.980]  The vibes are off.
[34:47.260 --> 34:48.860]  It did wash away some of the vibes.
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.480]  Talk to Andrew about the vibes.
[34:51.240 --> 34:53.860]  That older man with the cane and the pink shorts
[34:53.860 --> 34:55.840]  feels like he is a John Wick-like
[34:55.840 --> 34:56.300]  character.
[34:57.480 --> 34:58.740]  You mess with him.
[34:59.700 --> 35:02.760]  I think you might have a dumb hat on your way here.
[35:03.000 --> 35:03.620]  That's big time.
[35:05.940 --> 35:06.960]  Acknowledging the camera.
[35:08.800 --> 35:09.920]  Take a selfie.
[35:10.040 --> 35:10.360]  Take a selfie.
[35:11.260 --> 35:12.240]  Maybe if they hang around
[35:13.340 --> 35:15.140]  too long, they'll be an overstayer.
[35:15.600 --> 35:17.860]  Maybe they'll call the people that they're...
[35:18.960 --> 35:19.640]  Remember, in about
[35:19.640 --> 35:21.760]  30 minutes from now, Nick, add dumb hat
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.300]  to your board.
[35:25.840 --> 35:27.260]  I saw that one.
[35:27.500 --> 35:29.300]  It's almost a sports jersey, too.
[35:30.360 --> 35:31.420]  It's real close.
[35:31.840 --> 35:33.840]  No way! Is this a pickup?
[35:34.640 --> 35:35.120]  It's a pickup.
[35:35.820 --> 35:37.280]  Get in, you son of a bitch. Get in that car.
[35:37.820 --> 35:39.080]  Or is it the wrong car?
[35:39.240 --> 35:40.120]  It might be the wrong car.
[35:40.460 --> 35:42.020]  He can't open the door.
[35:42.100 --> 35:43.320]  It's the wrong car.
[35:46.340 --> 35:47.520]  He's still trying it.
[35:48.000 --> 35:49.440]  It's not the right car.
[35:49.440 --> 35:51.780]  Definitely the wrong car.
[35:54.940 --> 35:57.020]  Is wrong car on the list?
[35:57.500 --> 35:59.180]  Wasn't that something we didn't draft?
[35:59.420 --> 36:00.720]  I don't think anyone looked at it.
[36:01.320 --> 36:01.940]  Wow.
[36:02.940 --> 36:04.220]  It never happened.
[36:04.440 --> 36:05.440]  That is unbelievable.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.100]  That's never happened.
[36:08.540 --> 36:10.020]  That was unbelievable.
[36:10.600 --> 36:11.220]  Wow.
[36:12.080 --> 36:13.380]  I can't believe it.
[36:14.940 --> 36:17.160]  Where's your real pickup, old man?
[36:17.160 --> 36:19.740]  Let's get the skateboard and the pink taxi now.
[36:20.160 --> 36:20.920]  That's so crazy.
[36:20.920 --> 36:23.240]  Don't leave that on the table and pick dog and a hog.
[36:24.740 --> 36:27.240]  Gavin, we're in it together.
[36:27.380 --> 36:28.240]  Dog and a hog.
[36:28.640 --> 36:30.080]  Are these camera overstays?
[36:31.120 --> 36:32.820]  They're real goddamn close.
[36:33.060 --> 36:33.960]  I think they're leaving now.
[36:34.020 --> 36:36.260]  I want it to. It's not happening.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.560]  If they come back on camera...
[36:38.560 --> 36:41.200]  If they come back, then that's a walk past three plus times.
[36:42.340 --> 36:43.280]  Little old man,
[36:43.360 --> 36:44.300]  come back over here.
[36:45.840 --> 36:46.880]  Where's your pickup?
[36:48.720 --> 36:50.080]  That was unbelievable.
[36:50.180 --> 36:51.900]  I cannot believe we saw that.
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.340]  And it was so close and up front.
[36:55.700 --> 36:56.660]  That's not one, is it?
[36:56.760 --> 36:57.660]  Damn it, I keep saying that.
[36:58.980 --> 37:00.360]  I keep thinking it's something
[37:00.360 --> 37:01.280]  and it means nothing.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.280]  Holding hands is just like a handshake that's not moving.
[37:04.860 --> 37:05.800]  He found his...
[37:05.800 --> 37:07.200]  Is he going to get his vehicle pick up?
[37:08.440 --> 37:09.700]  No, that's not him either.
[37:09.700 --> 37:14.620]  It's got us on a side story.
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.040]  I'm very invested in it.
[37:16.900 --> 37:19.040]  Honestly, it's better than bingo, dude.
[37:19.320 --> 37:20.040]  It is.
[37:20.760 --> 37:22.140]  That dude is...
[37:22.140 --> 37:24.160]  One of these bros has to fist bump.
[37:25.180 --> 37:26.260]  Shake some hands.
[37:26.360 --> 37:26.900]  Give a high five.
[37:27.540 --> 37:28.100]  Come on.
[37:28.180 --> 37:29.220]  Shake your buddy's hand.
[37:29.620 --> 37:31.320]  He needs it.
[37:32.100 --> 37:33.080]  He feels lonely.
[37:33.360 --> 37:35.520]  You need a masculine connection.
[37:36.360 --> 37:38.480]  You almost took his hand.
[37:38.480 --> 37:39.500]  You didn't do it, though.
[37:39.540 --> 37:41.440]  Put your skin on his.
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.300]  His girlfriend left him last week.
[37:44.460 --> 37:45.720]  He needs touch.
[37:46.040 --> 37:46.880]  What are we doing?
[37:47.960 --> 37:48.660]  It's okay.
[37:49.740 --> 37:51.740]  It's alright. You can be vulnerable.
[37:52.740 --> 37:54.080]  Shake the goddamn hand.
[37:54.260 --> 37:54.880]  Where are you going?
[37:55.500 --> 37:57.320]  I'm only looking at the old man.
[37:58.020 --> 37:59.820]  I'm so locked in on that guy, dude.
[38:02.080 --> 38:03.860]  So much other stuff is happening.
[38:03.960 --> 38:04.560]  I don't care.
[38:05.540 --> 38:06.500]  Oh, my God.
[38:07.460 --> 38:09.240]  Will this man ever get in his car?
[38:09.560 --> 38:11.720]  He's my favorite NPC ever.
[38:12.760 --> 38:14.320]  He's looking around for the big taxis.
[38:14.420 --> 38:15.160]  He's like, where are they?
[38:15.740 --> 38:15.940]  Yeah.
[38:16.380 --> 38:18.280]  I dress for the occasion.
[38:19.260 --> 38:21.760]  None of these people are meeting out here.
[38:23.460 --> 38:25.260]  It's not the right time of night to meet out here.
[38:25.340 --> 38:25.600]  No!
[38:26.280 --> 38:26.980]  He's gone.
[38:27.040 --> 38:27.400]  No!
[38:30.720 --> 38:32.860]  Maybe he went to get a hot dog.
[38:32.860 --> 38:34.560]  I was going to say, he's getting a chili dog.
[38:37.680 --> 38:38.760]  Come back, old man.
[38:39.880 --> 38:41.340]  He's renting a motorcycle
[38:41.340 --> 38:43.280]  that's being delivered while he eats a hot dog.
[38:44.400 --> 38:46.340]  The chat just said, he'll be back.
[38:51.840 --> 38:52.580]  This is tense.
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.300]  Yeah, it is pretty tense.
[38:54.560 --> 38:55.340]  How close is everybody?
[38:55.780 --> 38:56.300]  I need one.
[38:56.400 --> 38:59.600]  I need dog and a hog.
[38:59.600 --> 39:01.040]  Crosswalk coward is tough
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.060]  because it's so like, oh, it's about to happen
[39:03.060 --> 39:03.740]  and then it never does.
[39:04.120 --> 39:07.040]  I need almost get hit by car, which is tough.
[39:07.320 --> 39:08.680]  That's a really tough one, bud.
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.220]  I need hug and selfie
[39:12.220 --> 39:13.980]  or hug and roller rubber.
[39:16.720 --> 39:19.100]  I could use chug and obviously dyed hair.
[39:19.400 --> 39:21.640]  See how there's this blonde woman, whatever?
[39:21.860 --> 39:23.560]  That, to me, isn't what we're looking for
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.540]  for obviously dyed hair.
[39:24.960 --> 39:27.480]  I'm not going for like, her hair is bleached.
[39:27.480 --> 39:29.520]  Like, get real. That's not the spirit of the fucking game.
[39:30.080 --> 39:31.940]  That's a conventional color.
[39:32.160 --> 39:32.400]  Exactly.
[39:33.060 --> 39:34.760]  Like, obviously dyed.
[39:34.960 --> 39:37.340]  But that's dyed, though. Right, it's not the spirit of the game.
[39:37.480 --> 39:38.140]  So, shut up.
[39:39.140 --> 39:40.120]  Eric's very angry today.
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.200]  This is the second time this guy's walked past.
[39:43.280 --> 39:44.880]  He comes back, that's three for me.
[39:44.900 --> 39:45.380]  One more time.
[39:46.440 --> 39:47.760]  Gavin is locked in.
[39:49.380 --> 39:50.520]  No, I'm going to separate.
[39:50.760 --> 39:51.320]  It's so funny.
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.140]  Oh, man.
[39:55.620 --> 39:56.540]  That got me good.
[39:57.600 --> 39:58.940]  Wait, wait, untethered soul.
[39:59.500 --> 40:00.280]  That's not offensive.
[40:00.880 --> 40:01.220]  Damn.
[40:02.100 --> 40:04.680]  You're just reading shirts going, are you mad about that?
[40:04.760 --> 40:05.480]  Are you mad about that shirt?
[40:05.660 --> 40:07.660]  How do we feel about Best Buy, guys?
[40:08.380 --> 40:10.840]  Oh, look at those boots and hat.
[40:11.240 --> 40:13.220]  Yeah, she got a lot there.
[40:13.300 --> 40:14.000]  We're checking them off.
[40:16.160 --> 40:17.360]  Somebody who's watching this,
[40:17.420 --> 40:17.980]  go back.
[40:18.540 --> 40:20.460]  The old man's back. He's back. He's over there.
[40:20.560 --> 40:21.600]  Yeah, I see the stick.
[40:21.600 --> 40:23.080]  You see the corner of him.
[40:25.820 --> 40:27.360]  Somebody in Key West,
[40:27.500 --> 40:28.800]  go be a crosswalk coward for a girl.
[40:28.820 --> 40:31.260]  No, his pickup is happening right on camera.
[40:35.000 --> 40:36.500]  And that guy came back.
[40:37.640 --> 40:38.900]  That's three times, Gavin.
[40:39.320 --> 40:40.100]  That's three times.
[40:41.820 --> 40:43.620]  And he dropped a spilled food or drink.
[40:44.120 --> 40:45.020]  Son of a bitch.
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.220]  I cannot believe that old man
[40:47.220 --> 40:48.680]  got picked up off camera.
[40:48.680 --> 40:49.180]  Damn.
[40:50.400 --> 40:52.600]  Get hit by a car.
[40:53.100 --> 40:53.580]  Almost.
[40:54.180 --> 40:55.840]  God damn it, turn around.
[40:56.820 --> 40:57.220]  Almost.
[40:58.680 --> 41:00.720]  That guy walked by for the fourth time, Gavin.
[41:01.080 --> 41:01.520]  Almost.
[41:03.420 --> 41:04.860]  God damn.
[41:05.580 --> 41:06.220]  Oh, that's a drink.
[41:06.300 --> 41:07.040]  You can drop that drink.
[41:08.240 --> 41:11.940]  You need a motorcycle and a dog.
[41:12.360 --> 41:12.660]  Now.
[41:13.900 --> 41:15.220]  That's a bicycle.
[41:17.540 --> 41:17.940]  Closer.
[41:19.040 --> 41:20.400]  It's a bicycle and a cat.
[41:20.760 --> 41:20.820]  Fuck.
[41:22.460 --> 41:24.120]  Somebody said the guy in the blue
[41:24.120 --> 41:25.980]  looks like Gus and Jack had a baby.
[41:26.120 --> 41:27.480]  Can you imagine what a pain in the ass
[41:27.480 --> 41:28.300]  that baby would be?
[41:29.720 --> 41:31.520]  That is a person I would not hang out with
[41:31.520 --> 41:32.140]  when they got older.
[41:34.780 --> 41:36.320]  This woman on the tricycle
[41:36.320 --> 41:37.780]  has just stopped in the street.
[41:38.420 --> 41:38.580]  Yeah.
[41:39.680 --> 41:41.380]  She's looking at her phone.
[41:41.540 --> 41:42.520]  Get her phone, dude.
[41:42.520 --> 41:43.680]  She does not care.
[41:45.460 --> 41:46.200]  Hey, man.
[41:46.320 --> 41:47.500]  She doesn't give an anus.
[41:50.880 --> 41:52.420]  She's dancing hard over there.
[41:53.080 --> 41:54.160]  If somebody doesn't
[41:54.160 --> 41:56.240]  almost get hit by a car, I'm going to scream.
[41:58.080 --> 41:59.320]  You might be screaming, man.
[41:59.360 --> 42:00.600]  You're going to scream.
[42:01.560 --> 42:03.000]  Just prepare your lungs, bro.
[42:05.440 --> 42:06.120]  Meemaw, no.
[42:08.640 --> 42:09.620]  Shake that dude's hand.
[42:10.280 --> 42:11.200]  Shake your buddy's hand.
[42:11.220 --> 42:12.040]  What does your shirt say?
[42:12.280 --> 42:13.060]  Shake his hand.
[42:14.340 --> 42:16.660]  Don't put your hand on him. Shake it.
[42:16.680 --> 42:18.840]  Shake it or high five it.
[42:20.560 --> 42:22.080]  Touch tips of your fingers.
[42:22.260 --> 42:23.280]  Dickhead, come on.
[42:23.560 --> 42:24.580]  It's a crosswalk cowards here, baby.
[42:27.620 --> 42:28.100]  Whoa.
[42:28.940 --> 42:30.460]  Screaming outside. Jesus.
[42:35.940 --> 42:37.780]  Look at all these people now.
[42:38.360 --> 42:38.800]  There's a dog.
[42:39.260 --> 42:39.660]  Dog.
[42:40.020 --> 42:40.660]  We need a dog.
[42:44.920 --> 42:46.700]  Did Blake still throw a no-hitter?
[42:47.660 --> 42:47.820]  What?
[42:48.540 --> 42:50.880]  Did he? I don't know. Somebody in the chat just said it.
[42:51.180 --> 42:51.940]  No fucking way.
[42:52.800 --> 42:54.160]  Oh, the Phillies are playing right now. Hold on.
[42:54.520 --> 42:54.860]  Cheers.
[42:56.700 --> 42:57.360]  They're in Seattle.
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.000]  Chug.
[43:00.860 --> 43:02.400]  Come on, crosswalk cowards.
[43:03.120 --> 43:04.260]  Where's y'all's dogs?
[43:05.860 --> 43:06.860]  Yeah, nobody's sucking
[43:06.860 --> 43:07.900]  on a chili dog tonight.
[43:09.440 --> 43:10.520]  Blake still threw a no-hitter.
[43:10.680 --> 43:11.200]  Whoa, that's crazy.
[43:12.660 --> 43:13.800]  Fucking pitcher's year, huh?
[43:14.160 --> 43:14.620]  Pitcher's era.
[43:17.500 --> 43:18.400]  He's a giant, too.
[43:18.520 --> 43:20.820]  That really sucks.
[43:21.560 --> 43:23.020]  Oh, the Phillies are losing by eight.
[43:23.160 --> 43:24.220]  Well, I'm going to turn that off.
[43:27.160 --> 43:28.480]  Oh, that's a scooter gang.
[43:28.700 --> 43:29.800]  Wait, is that a scooter gang?
[43:30.540 --> 43:31.260]  No, hold on.
[43:31.440 --> 43:33.940]  No, that's a bunch of hogs.
[43:33.940 --> 43:35.280]  Oh, god damn it.
[43:36.200 --> 43:37.940]  There's hogs with no dogs, baby.
[43:38.540 --> 43:39.500]  There's weak-ass hogs.
[43:39.500 --> 43:39.880]  Where's the dog?
[43:41.640 --> 43:42.540]  Is that a chili dog?
[43:43.000 --> 43:46.100]  No, I was just looking out for one because of all those hogs.
[43:46.240 --> 43:47.980]  I wish that lady had pulled one out of her purse.
[43:50.860 --> 43:51.580]  Chili dog?
[43:52.680 --> 43:53.460]  Yeah, chili dog.
[43:55.640 --> 43:56.740]  That has to count.
[43:57.220 --> 43:57.940]  Oh, hug?
[43:59.220 --> 44:00.980]  Oh, the height discrepancy. I don't think we're getting a hug.
[44:02.280 --> 44:03.900]  You're judging by height and vibes?
[44:04.420 --> 44:08.040]  If you're really short and they're really tall, you're probably fismal.
[44:08.640 --> 44:11.040]  That's probably the way, yeah.
[44:11.920 --> 44:13.140]  You go low, I go high.
[44:13.480 --> 44:13.880]  Or whatever.
[44:14.480 --> 44:16.080]  Exactly, like Obama said.
[44:18.000 --> 44:19.180]  Pink taxi, please.
[44:21.840 --> 44:26.840]  I don't like that the bodyguards or bouncers are wearing orange.
[44:27.260 --> 44:28.400]  The bodyguards?
[44:31.540 --> 44:33.760]  I wish you'd have them at the box office.
[44:36.140 --> 44:38.100]  There's always an offensive t-shirt.
[44:38.300 --> 44:39.120]  And yet, not tonight.
[44:39.760 --> 44:40.260]  Whoa!
[44:41.060 --> 44:41.740]  Whoa!
[44:43.760 --> 44:46.360]  Slow the fuck down!
[44:46.620 --> 44:48.400]  What are you doing?
[44:48.880 --> 44:51.080]  Did you see that crosswalk?
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.480]  That was a huge crosswalk.
[44:54.960 --> 44:55.640]  Bingo!
[44:56.760 --> 44:57.920]  Oh, shit!
[44:58.220 --> 44:58.380]  Coward!
[44:58.380 --> 45:00.400]  Cowboy boots! American flag clothes!
[45:00.500 --> 45:02.060]  Nighttime shades! Acknowledged camera!
[45:02.180 --> 45:02.960]  Crosswalk coward!
[45:03.320 --> 45:05.040]  I wonder what kind of cake I should get.
[45:05.200 --> 45:08.560]  Very exciting to once again be winning Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.940]  Let's play for Blackout to give some of these other losers something to do.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Guys, congratulations to Eric.
[45:14.120 --> 45:16.220]  The king of games that he hates.
[45:16.440 --> 45:17.000]  Isn't that great?
[45:17.900 --> 45:18.640]  You hate this game?
[45:19.380 --> 45:20.560]  Clap for me.
[45:21.840 --> 45:23.980]  Congratulations, Eric, on your victory.
[45:24.300 --> 45:25.640]  I hope you enjoy your cake.
[45:25.640 --> 45:27.520]  Corn cats in the chat.
[45:28.780 --> 45:29.680]  Not piss rats.
[45:29.820 --> 45:30.520]  Stop doing piss rats.
[45:30.560 --> 45:31.820]  Corn cats only!
[45:34.400 --> 45:34.820]  Corn cats only!
[45:35.720 --> 45:36.360]  Corn cats!
[45:36.940 --> 45:37.160]  No!
[45:39.560 --> 45:41.580]  Hey, guys, I'm Eric. You know what? I hate fun.
[45:41.720 --> 45:42.640]  Let's keep going.
[45:46.460 --> 45:48.260]  It's overwhelmingly piss rats.
[45:48.380 --> 45:48.800]  This sucks.
[45:52.180 --> 45:53.920]  Let's keep playing for Blackout, I guess.
[45:56.400 --> 45:58.020]  Where are the dogs?
[45:58.360 --> 45:59.900]  Dude, there's no dogs.
[46:00.040 --> 46:01.580]  There's no hogs.
[46:01.580 --> 46:03.160]  There's no dogs. There's no physical touch.
[46:04.940 --> 46:06.180]  Yeah, we need to see some touch.
[46:06.260 --> 46:06.800]  That sounded weird.
[46:07.060 --> 46:08.160]  We need touching and dropping.
[46:09.860 --> 46:11.640]  If you hug someone...
[46:12.160 --> 46:13.340]  Thinking about it.
[46:13.900 --> 46:14.220]  Fuck!
[46:15.260 --> 46:15.520]  Wait.
[46:17.760 --> 46:19.180]  Do we got kissing on here?
[46:19.340 --> 46:20.320]  Anybody loving kissing?
[46:21.640 --> 46:23.980]  People aren't super sloppy yet.
[46:23.980 --> 46:24.280]  Yeah.
[46:25.140 --> 46:27.320]  A lot of this stuff is going to happen a lot.
[46:27.540 --> 46:30.100]  In a lot more frequency in a little bit.
[46:30.180 --> 46:32.060]  I just realized I've only needed a dog
[46:32.060 --> 46:33.120]  for like 30 minutes.
[46:34.420 --> 46:35.920]  Dude, I've only needed almost
[46:35.920 --> 46:37.920]  get hit by a car almost the whole time.
[46:38.200 --> 46:39.720]  I need a dog and a hog.
[46:41.240 --> 46:42.380]  It's too many piss rats.
[46:42.540 --> 46:44.140]  We need to have some corn cats in here.
[46:44.280 --> 46:46.000]  No such thing
[46:46.000 --> 46:46.820]  as too many piss rats.
[46:47.000 --> 46:47.360]  Dog!
[46:49.580 --> 46:50.180]  Where's the hog?
[46:50.180 --> 46:51.180]  Where's the hog?
[46:51.780 --> 46:54.680]  I just want the hog.
[46:54.740 --> 46:55.160]  Come on.
[46:55.340 --> 46:57.780]  The dog is chilling.
[46:58.540 --> 46:59.860]  Can we get something else?
[47:00.700 --> 47:01.260]  There's a dog.
[47:03.020 --> 47:03.920]  It's a bicycle.
[47:05.660 --> 47:06.920]  There's a car pickup.
[47:08.060 --> 47:08.980]  Everything's happening.
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.600]  I need a drunk lock.
[47:10.680 --> 47:11.300]  Where's a drunk lock?
[47:12.800 --> 47:14.120]  There's got to be a motorcycle.
[47:14.880 --> 47:15.920]  The dog is still here.
[47:16.020 --> 47:17.340]  The dog is still on camera.
[47:17.340 --> 47:19.380]  The dog is still on camera.
[47:19.380 --> 47:19.740]  No!
[47:19.900 --> 47:20.560]  He's gone!
[47:22.660 --> 47:25.080]  You've lost your dog.
[47:25.420 --> 47:26.620]  Scooter gang, there's two.
[47:26.860 --> 47:27.940]  It's the gang!
[47:31.160 --> 47:32.320]  Scooter gang.
[47:32.620 --> 47:33.340]  Beep beep, baby.
[47:35.260 --> 47:35.900]  What?
[47:38.500 --> 47:39.700]  That is a scooter gang.
[47:40.420 --> 47:40.880]  Congratulations.
[47:43.060 --> 47:45.120]  If I get camera shy,
[47:45.120 --> 47:46.080]  I'll get another bingo.
[47:46.740 --> 47:49.000]  If you do that, I'm going to be pissed.
[47:49.140 --> 47:50.520]  Why did I pick sports jersey?
[47:50.720 --> 47:51.680]  What a fucking dumb choice.
[47:52.880 --> 47:54.920]  Sports jersey and obviously dyed hair
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.640]  is not crushing the way I thought it would.
[47:57.100 --> 47:58.380]  What about that Royals guy?
[47:58.700 --> 47:59.640]  That wasn't a jersey.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.300]  It was just a shirt.
[48:00.860 --> 48:03.860]  It's got to be a jersey.
[48:04.720 --> 48:06.360]  You guys want to know a really dumb decision?
[48:06.580 --> 48:09.300]  Hooking my wagon to Gavin's star.
[48:11.440 --> 48:13.080]  We could have told you that, man.
[48:13.080 --> 48:13.480]  Yeah.
[48:13.740 --> 48:17.520]  Oh, there's a luxury car.
[48:17.720 --> 48:19.140]  That's a Bima.
[48:19.180 --> 48:21.180]  Do you guys remember when we saw that dog
[48:21.180 --> 48:23.420]  and then it was just screaming about a motorcycle?
[48:23.800 --> 48:24.300]  Yeah.
[48:24.820 --> 48:26.440]  It was just all bicycles.
[48:26.720 --> 48:27.520]  Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
[48:31.420 --> 48:33.280]  We got all kinds of people
[48:33.280 --> 48:35.340]  watching this in chat. Let us know when you get a bingo.
[48:35.680 --> 48:37.120]  Then regenerate your bingo card
[48:37.120 --> 48:39.040]  and then see if people can miraculously
[48:39.040 --> 48:40.500]  just punch stuff on yours too.
[48:40.500 --> 48:42.340]  And then have to generate a new one.
[48:42.440 --> 48:44.000]  Yeah, y'all be sure to play together.
[48:44.160 --> 48:45.180]  Also, that's matching outfits.
[48:45.860 --> 48:47.380]  Oh, yeah.
[48:47.540 --> 48:48.100]  Matching outfits.
[48:49.660 --> 48:51.340]  Are they watching the camera?
[48:51.620 --> 48:52.640]  Or are they watching something else?
[48:53.100 --> 48:55.380]  They're watching slow-mo guys?
[48:55.500 --> 48:58.100]  Oh, wow. Congrats, Gavin.
[48:58.800 --> 49:00.280]  That's like four views right there.
[49:00.560 --> 49:02.220]  That's a pretty formal dress, that orange one.
[49:02.520 --> 49:03.980]  No, it's not.
[49:06.540 --> 49:08.260]  So, we're going for a blackout now?
[49:08.260 --> 49:08.860]  Yeah, why not?
[49:14.500 --> 49:16.160]  Is he Andrew? I can't tell.
[49:16.340 --> 49:17.320]  I think that's the website.
[49:17.480 --> 49:19.560]  He's on the Sloppy Joe's website.
[49:27.080 --> 49:29.540]  I feel like we're on the brink of so much...
[49:29.540 --> 49:31.400]  Yeah, there's a lot of activity here.
[49:31.620 --> 49:32.640]  A lot of activity.
[49:32.640 --> 49:34.940]  There's a lot of activity.
[49:35.840 --> 49:36.780]  We're about to get hugged.
[49:36.960 --> 49:38.520]  Come on, hug. Let's get a hug.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.360]  Dude, that's a sweet stache on that guy right there.
[49:41.440 --> 49:42.880]  Bowl cut, dude. Holy shit.
[49:43.800 --> 49:44.580]  Homeless Andrew Luck.
[49:49.020 --> 49:49.900]  Celebrity lookalike.
[49:50.400 --> 49:51.660]  This Homeless Andrew Luck.
[49:52.040 --> 49:53.360]  Get real.
[49:55.020 --> 49:56.660]  If somebody else called it,
[49:56.780 --> 49:58.080]  then I don't have to prove it.
[49:58.420 --> 49:58.900]  Suck it.
[49:58.900 --> 50:01.260]  That was like a first base
[50:01.260 --> 50:02.180]  lookalike.
[50:02.880 --> 50:03.780]  Alright, fine.
[50:04.140 --> 50:06.900]  This whole thing
[50:08.060 --> 50:08.640]  has been Nick
[50:08.640 --> 50:11.000]  not seeing the things he's been marking off his card
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.220]  and going, oh, I'm so close.
[50:15.400 --> 50:17.240]  Nick's descent continues
[50:17.240 --> 50:18.720]  into madness.
[50:19.800 --> 50:20.900]  10.50, we're getting close
[50:20.900 --> 50:22.740]  to Sloppy Clock. Yeah, we're getting there.
[50:24.100 --> 50:24.800]  Our wonderful makeup.
[50:24.800 --> 50:25.240]  Oh, God.
[50:26.640 --> 50:28.800]  I'm gonna get blackout. I can feel it.
[50:29.740 --> 50:30.220]  Drunk?
[50:31.380 --> 50:32.780]  I feel like we've crossed
[50:32.780 --> 50:34.880]  the line of Mimas. There's just not gonna be any
[50:34.880 --> 50:36.960]  Mimas. Nah, we're gonna get Mimas.
[50:37.120 --> 50:37.300]  Nah.
[50:38.340 --> 50:39.680]  Mimas only come out at night.
[50:41.320 --> 50:42.880]  That certainly isn't true.
[50:44.280 --> 50:44.940]  No, that's definitely
[50:44.940 --> 50:45.460]  not true.
[50:45.720 --> 50:49.240]  Is that...
[50:49.240 --> 50:50.240]  This guy looks pretty drunk.
[50:51.940 --> 50:52.900]  I think
[50:52.900 --> 50:54.280]  he's just the way that guy is.
[50:54.360 --> 50:54.880]  Yeah.
[50:55.200 --> 50:57.480]  I was on the fence.
[50:58.040 --> 51:00.940]  That guy gave off GTA 5
[51:00.940 --> 51:02.080]  NPC vibes.
[51:02.860 --> 51:04.880]  He was giving me Mickey Rourke vibes.
[51:05.260 --> 51:05.800]  Kinda.
[51:07.940 --> 51:08.880]  No offensive
[51:08.880 --> 51:09.480]  t-shirts.
[51:09.980 --> 51:11.480]  Nick, unbelievable.
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.040]  Such a good pick to have on your board.
[51:14.300 --> 51:16.460]  Unbelievable. I'm blown away.
[51:16.600 --> 51:17.320]  It's a real bummer.
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.040]  Oh,
[51:21.640 --> 51:22.000]  he's actually
[51:22.000 --> 51:23.260]  cool too. The guy who was
[51:23.260 --> 51:25.200]  moseying where we said, is that a drunk walk? Do you think that was
[51:25.200 --> 51:27.040]  dead parrot head? No.
[51:27.920 --> 51:29.320]  Yeah, it's too on the line
[51:29.320 --> 51:31.020]  for me. I wouldn't
[51:31.020 --> 51:31.800]  count it.
[51:32.620 --> 51:34.480]  That dude had a place to go.
[51:35.640 --> 51:37.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good way to put it.
[51:38.160 --> 51:38.700]  He had purpose.
[51:39.200 --> 51:41.340]  That was a luxury car. That was a Mercedes or something.
[51:41.440 --> 51:41.920]  Yeah, it was.
[51:45.080 --> 51:46.340]  I haven't seen a beach
[51:46.340 --> 51:47.240]  goth yet either.
[51:47.740 --> 51:49.080]  I need one.
[51:49.560 --> 51:51.400]  No, the rain chased him off.
[51:52.480 --> 51:53.600]  My eyeliner.
[51:56.700 --> 51:59.300]  I wonder how many fist bumps I've missed.
[51:59.780 --> 52:00.200]  Yeah, right.
[52:00.800 --> 52:02.000]  Probably a lot.
[52:06.580 --> 52:07.620]  Somebody shake a
[52:07.620 --> 52:08.320]  fucking hand.
[52:09.120 --> 52:11.180]  Is there anyone here who has moral objections to the
[52:11.180 --> 52:12.520]  north face? No.
[52:14.240 --> 52:14.760]  You're
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.640]  trying to get the north face down
[52:16.640 --> 52:17.800]  as an offensive shirt.
[52:19.360 --> 52:20.400]  I'm desperate.
[52:21.380 --> 52:22.420]  Oh, the
[52:22.420 --> 52:23.180]  north face.
[52:23.700 --> 52:25.340]  Look at the sheen on that.
[52:27.300 --> 52:27.820]  Whiskey.
[52:28.400 --> 52:29.280]  Damn, it didn't say dick.
[52:32.020 --> 52:32.540]  Skulls
[52:32.540 --> 52:33.300]  are pretty offensive.
[52:33.700 --> 52:34.400]  Oh, get real.
[52:35.720 --> 52:36.720]  Well, yeah.
[52:45.660 --> 52:46.140]  Regular
[52:46.140 --> 52:46.980]  kind of taxi.
[52:47.500 --> 52:49.940]  Really thought we were going to get dog and a hog there.
[52:50.200 --> 52:51.580]  You were really close.
[52:52.140 --> 52:54.080]  Now, I like dog and a hog now because
[52:54.080 --> 52:56.320]  as long as a dog is on the screen
[52:56.320 --> 52:58.320]  we're going to be screaming about
[52:58.320 --> 52:58.760]  motorcycles.
[52:59.380 --> 53:02.260]  And that dog hung about for a minute at least.
[53:02.260 --> 53:03.240]  He was there for a while.
[53:03.540 --> 53:05.100]  I bet that shirt was offensive.
[53:05.620 --> 53:06.540]  Is this a pick up?
[53:06.700 --> 53:09.200]  What the fuck was that?
[53:09.600 --> 53:10.600]  Definitely a drug deal.
[53:12.440 --> 53:14.100]  It's okay if you throw it on the floor.
[53:14.220 --> 53:15.860]  It's not illegal. It just happened.
[53:17.440 --> 53:18.280]  Whoops, I dropped
[53:18.280 --> 53:19.100]  this illegal substance.
[53:20.920 --> 53:22.240]  Everybody in the chat
[53:22.240 --> 53:23.400]  is an accomplice now.
[53:26.880 --> 53:27.740]  Somebody said hurry.
[53:27.800 --> 53:28.520]  Who's screaming?
[53:28.980 --> 53:30.320]  Who did say hurry?
[53:31.540 --> 53:31.980]  Oh.
[53:33.060 --> 53:34.440]  They almost clipped that dude.
[53:35.120 --> 53:35.560]  Separate.
[53:35.880 --> 53:37.800]  That was impressive.
[53:39.220 --> 53:39.700]  Oh, pick up.
[53:40.040 --> 53:41.120]  We had to pick it up earlier.
[53:42.620 --> 53:44.600]  1, 2, 3
[53:44.600 --> 53:45.840]  There's a lot of guys getting in that thing.
[53:46.260 --> 53:46.700]  4
[53:47.960 --> 53:49.760]  I think it's 5.
[53:49.960 --> 53:52.020]  The guy in the red hat was definitely a drunk walk.
[53:52.660 --> 53:52.980]  Really?
[53:53.720 --> 53:54.880]  You didn't see that?
[53:55.180 --> 53:56.920]  He was hobbling all over the place.
[53:56.920 --> 53:57.960]  I'll give it to you if you want it.
[53:57.960 --> 53:58.800]  I don't think it's a clown car.
[53:59.340 --> 54:02.460]  Is it only clown
[54:02.460 --> 54:03.320]  if people are getting out?
[54:04.280 --> 54:05.940]  No, it can be clown getting in.
[54:06.220 --> 54:07.120]  I think it'll fit.
[54:08.840 --> 54:10.600]  The clowns gotta get in the car
[54:10.600 --> 54:11.540]  to get out of them, right?
[54:22.000 --> 54:22.400]  Separated.
[54:22.620 --> 54:23.580]  Separated at crosswalk.
[54:25.180 --> 54:26.480]  Was he with anyone?
[54:26.800 --> 54:27.860]  No, he's not with them.
[54:27.860 --> 54:28.600]  He's not with them.
[54:28.800 --> 54:29.920]  He's alone, look at him.
[54:33.720 --> 54:34.900]  The homie's right here.
[54:35.260 --> 54:38.200]  All the homie's right here.
[54:38.280 --> 54:38.860]  No, look.
[54:39.100 --> 54:40.880]  These are his fucking friends.
[54:41.240 --> 54:43.240]  I don't know.
[54:44.520 --> 54:46.040]  They all just left him.
[54:46.220 --> 54:47.320]  They're leaving without him.
[54:47.500 --> 54:48.720]  Nick, they weren't friends.
[54:50.140 --> 54:52.780]  Go over there with your friends, you son of a bitch.
[54:52.780 --> 54:54.160]  Did she drop something?
[54:54.220 --> 54:54.460]  She did.
[54:54.460 --> 54:56.620]  She dropped something.
[54:56.820 --> 54:57.700]  Was it food, though?
[54:57.780 --> 54:58.840]  No, it was money.
[55:00.780 --> 55:02.800]  That guy's definitely not with them.
[55:03.020 --> 55:03.940]  Damn it.
[55:04.520 --> 55:05.400]  Damn it.
[55:06.840 --> 55:08.220]  Separated at crosswalk was so close.
[55:08.840 --> 55:10.420]  That was gonna be a hug or something?
[55:11.440 --> 55:12.560]  More fucking kids.
[55:12.560 --> 55:13.060]  That's not a hug.
[55:13.880 --> 55:14.440]  No dogs.
[55:17.020 --> 55:19.340]  We're in the brink of so much shit right here.
[55:19.400 --> 55:19.960]  It's incredible.
[55:20.140 --> 55:21.160]  Right here.
[55:21.160 --> 55:21.200]  Right here.
[55:22.880 --> 55:24.600]  This is as exciting as the Olympics.
[55:24.800 --> 55:26.420]  I bet that kid's shirt was offensive.
[55:27.320 --> 55:28.780]  It just said fuck.
[55:33.940 --> 55:35.640]  Come on, dead parrot head.
[55:35.920 --> 55:37.200]  What kind of cake should I get, Andrew?
[55:39.480 --> 55:41.620]  What kind of cake should we get, Eric?
[55:43.200 --> 55:44.120]  I'm thinking...
[55:44.120 --> 55:47.460]  I'm thinking maybe a Black Forest cake.
[55:47.460 --> 55:49.440]  Oh, snap.
[55:49.440 --> 55:51.320]  That's good shit right there.
[55:51.420 --> 55:53.440]  It does have pecans and stuff on the top, right?
[55:53.700 --> 55:54.260]  I just...
[55:54.260 --> 55:55.580]  I don't know.
[55:57.880 --> 56:00.120]  He just poured his whole drink out.
[56:00.520 --> 56:01.680]  Is that a drop?
[56:02.080 --> 56:03.420]  Those are limes.
[56:03.700 --> 56:04.680]  Those are limes on the ground.
[56:05.100 --> 56:06.720]  It was like a whole drink.
[56:06.780 --> 56:07.580]  We talked about ice.
[56:08.580 --> 56:10.860]  Does that mean drops were spilled, though?
[56:11.200 --> 56:12.620]  No, because it's intentional.
[56:13.460 --> 56:15.440]  That's actually a really good point.
[56:15.440 --> 56:15.840]  Yeah.
[56:16.380 --> 56:19.620]  I think a drink sling
[56:19.620 --> 56:20.320]  isn't a spill.
[56:21.480 --> 56:23.360]  I don't think we need it still.
[56:25.360 --> 56:26.480]  That's rough, man.
[56:27.660 --> 56:29.000]  I don't think it counts as littering
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.860]  if it's a piece of food.
[56:32.440 --> 56:33.300]  Crosswalk cowards.
[56:34.040 --> 56:35.540]  They hesitated by the bicycle.
[56:37.720 --> 56:39.620]  If hesitation was crosswalk cowards,
[56:39.620 --> 56:41.080]  it would have been the first thing I crossed off.
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.260]  I mean, we already have it.
[56:42.260 --> 56:42.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:43.300 --> 56:46.680]  I think it's got to be pretty deliberate.
[56:46.880 --> 56:48.340]  I thought she was going to take a fucking spill.
[56:48.340 --> 56:49.040]  I did, too.
[56:49.420 --> 56:50.840]  I thought she was going down.
[56:51.640 --> 56:53.240]  That was a brave jump.
[56:55.800 --> 56:57.440]  Do you think anyone steps on the lime?
[57:00.300 --> 57:03.240]  Oh, what is happening? That's clown car.
[57:04.120 --> 57:05.760]  No way. That looked weird.
[57:05.780 --> 57:07.340]  There's two people leaning out that window.
[57:08.800 --> 57:10.260]  Maybe somebody farted that.
[57:10.260 --> 57:11.380]  I don't know.
[57:13.860 --> 57:17.260]  There were two people on the back window together.
[57:18.900 --> 57:20.380]  In the classic clown fashion.
[57:20.740 --> 57:22.380]  If they were strapped to the top, I would be with you.
[57:22.540 --> 57:23.620]  But just hanging up the window.
[57:26.300 --> 57:28.820]  We need some bungee cords and a person on top
[57:28.820 --> 57:30.500]  for that to be a clown car.
[57:30.680 --> 57:35.020]  I need somebody to be a fucking chili dog.
[57:36.400 --> 57:39.020]  I could do for a dead parrot head right about now.
[57:41.600 --> 57:43.200]  How about some pink taxi?
[57:43.540 --> 57:44.920]  Can you imagine how great it would be
[57:44.920 --> 57:46.260]  if that old man with the cane
[57:46.260 --> 57:47.820]  just walked back into frame right now
[57:47.820 --> 57:48.740]  if he was still there.
[57:51.200 --> 57:53.160]  I saw pink turn the corner
[57:53.160 --> 57:54.040]  and I got real excited.
[57:57.560 --> 58:00.000]  Unbelievable how there's only been one dog all night.
[58:02.500 --> 58:04.140]  I think you made a great point
[58:04.140 --> 58:05.040]  of all the fist bumps, Gavin.
[58:05.160 --> 58:08.640]  I haven't seen a single moment of human-on-human contact
[58:08.640 --> 58:09.620]  in this whole thing.
[58:09.700 --> 58:13.080]  There must have been more.
[58:14.840 --> 58:16.540]  We have seen hand-holding, you're right about that.
[58:18.620 --> 58:20.700]  We got people hanging out the top of this car.
[58:24.060 --> 58:26.220]  Nick, don't even call it clown car.
[58:26.420 --> 58:28.400]  I'm not calling anything yet.
[58:29.240 --> 58:30.640]  I haven't seen enough evidence.
[58:31.260 --> 58:32.400]  She's looking at...
[58:32.400 --> 58:34.240]  They're looking at themselves on the camera.
[58:34.560 --> 58:36.140]  We already got a knowledge camera.
[58:36.140 --> 58:37.520]  There's so many ghost hordes tonight.
[58:38.200 --> 58:39.800]  Yeah, that's the third time I've seen them.
[58:39.980 --> 58:40.500]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[58:40.920 --> 58:43.440]  We already got that.
[58:43.560 --> 58:45.480]  We need her to call home about the camera.
[58:46.440 --> 58:48.240]  I'm starting a three-minute timer on these two.
[58:48.920 --> 58:49.200]  Okay.
[58:49.320 --> 58:50.060]  See if they ever stay.
[58:51.340 --> 58:52.940]  Bring the phone to your ear.
[58:54.320 --> 58:55.960]  Bring the phone to your ear.
[58:56.180 --> 58:56.900]  You know you want it to.
[58:58.240 --> 58:59.500]  Take the selfie.
[59:02.200 --> 59:03.340]  Call home about it.
[59:04.100 --> 59:05.800]  Whoever's friends are in the chat,
[59:06.380 --> 59:07.440]  if your friend is there,
[59:07.580 --> 59:08.920]  tell them to come take a selfie,
[59:09.180 --> 59:11.100]  take their shoes off, and then...
[59:11.100 --> 59:13.660]  What the fuck? Get a hot dog and ride a motorcycle.
[59:13.740 --> 59:14.560]  Get a hot dog.
[59:14.700 --> 59:16.960]  And almost get hit by a car.
[59:17.100 --> 59:19.540]  Or even get hit by a car, because I think that still counts.
[59:19.660 --> 59:21.180]  Because before you get hit, you almost get hit.
[59:21.200 --> 59:22.260]  You almost get hit, it's true.
[59:23.140 --> 59:25.500]  And then tell us who their celebrity doppelganger is.
[59:29.390 --> 59:30.550]  How's the timer looking, Gavin?
[59:31.450 --> 59:32.090]  We're about a minute.
[59:32.090 --> 59:32.690]  Okay.
[59:37.100 --> 59:38.380]  Hey, wave, hey, wave.
[59:39.260 --> 59:40.940]  We get it, we get it, we get it.
[59:41.980 --> 59:42.720]  Thank you.
[59:42.860 --> 59:44.440]  Thank you for blowing a kiss.
[59:46.660 --> 59:48.740]  Uh-oh, that van was really...
[59:49.220 --> 59:50.080]  creepy right there.
[59:51.280 --> 59:53.440]  I thought that truck was going to keep going
[59:53.440 --> 59:54.600]  and almost get those two women,
[59:54.720 --> 59:56.000]  and it didn't.
[59:56.340 --> 59:57.680]  Now that's a dickhead truck.
[59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.140]  Jesus Christ.
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.300]  Oh, boy.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:04.580]  Woof.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.420]  Can we get some...
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.420]  beach goth, please?
[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.580]  How's the timer looking, Gavin?
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:13.140]  A minute off.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.060]  Hi.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.920]  Don't leave, don't leave!
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:18.300]  No!
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:22.600]  Sorry, they weren't on the phone long enough
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.020]  to complete the trace.
[01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.440]  One of them took a selfie.
[01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.680]  Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.660]  Again, again.
[01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:30.400]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.300]  That's awesome. Another thing Nick didn't see
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:33.360]  that he's going to knock off his list.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.740]  You know what? If you don't want me to get it,
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.420]  don't say it.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.840]  No, I mentioned it after she'd already left,
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.940]  so you didn't see it.
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.180]  No, I saw it.
[01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.800]  Nick's whole board is stuff he didn't see.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.100]  He didn't see a single thing.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:46.540]  It rocks.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.520]  It's so good.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:53.120]  It's stuff he didn't see.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.340]  He doesn't know what to look out for.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.460]  I'm calling that girl a beach god.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.560]  She had black pants, black shirt, black purse,
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.320]  black jacket.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.840]  You know what, Geoff?
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.720]  In my benevolent state of catching things later,
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:07.180]  I give it to you.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.180]  The styling was wrong, but what else are you going to do
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.120]  when you have five articles of all black clothing?
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.040]  Right, the styling is wrong.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.740]  Okay, I won't call it.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.280]  I would have given it to you, Geoff.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:18.060]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:21.580]  Yeah, if he had seen it, he would have given it to you, dude.
[01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:23.200]  I saw it.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.240]  Hey, listen, I saw it.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.660]  He just has everything. He'll give everything.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.680]  It doesn't matter. He doesn't care.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.580]  Just walk up. Grab some cake, god damn it.
[01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:37.480]  Geoff, we have to go over to your house
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.320]  this week and eat some cake.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.940]  Okay, let's do it.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.980]  That'll be some supplemental.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.060]  Yeah, why not?
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.440]  Our first one, our first cake.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.260]  Oh, my time
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:49.640]  had just ended.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.480]  I wonder if we should
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.120]  enable trading
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.180]  between each other with our boards.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.020]  That's very
[01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:01.800]  interesting.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.200]  I really
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.860]  like the idea of that, Andrew.
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.880]  I'll trade pink taxi to somebody.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.400]  I mean, obviously we can't
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.320]  do it right now.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:13.300]  Eventually.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.920]  I think doing another supplemental
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:18.860]  where...
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.920]  I got it.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.220]  Dickhead.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.260]  What the fuck?
[01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.900]  Sorry, I panicked.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:27.780]  You just flew out.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.800]  I panicked too.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:31.960]  Anyway, what happened?
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.780]  I think the idea of trading things
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.100]  is awesome. I think it's so smart.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:38.340]  They're back!
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.200]  Oh, they're back!
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:43.100]  She might be calling home!
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:44.940]  I'm restyling
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.340]  my timer a minute and a half.
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.120]  She's clicking so many
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.800]  buttons. What else should she be doing?
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.060]  Oh, she's tweeting.
[01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:54.960]  Let's see.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.120]  I can't believe that.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.560]  Can I resume the timer?
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.640]  It's up to you.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.120]  Do you think these...
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.080]  You know what's awesome is these people are looking
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.720]  at the Sloppy Joe's webcam
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.120]  and they see like 310
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.160]  people watching. They have no idea
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.080]  an additional 3000 people are
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.020]  watching them. Unless she's a regulation
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.480]  listener.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.600]  They're calling someone!
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.440]  That's a FaceTime!
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.800]  That's a FaceTime!
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.900]  What do you mean? They're looking and waving!
[01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.180]  They're not talking.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.900]  They're talking.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.140]  They're just looking at the site.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.180]  They're just looking at the camera.
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.520]  I have
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.060]  call home about camera
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:37.580]  and I want it desperately. That's just not what it was.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:38.800]  I...
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.260]  It wasn't.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.380]  I have 50 seconds left
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.300]  on those two if they come back.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.260]  If they come back, there's no way
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.480]  they came back just to wave at the camera again.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:51.440]  Clearly like they're hitting buttons.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.000]  That wasn't a call though.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.760]  They weren't talking to anyone.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.380]  Instrument!
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.760]  Holy shit!
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.240]  Holy shit!
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.360]  I'm just an old
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.120]  dude on a scooter with a guitar.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.160]  I don't think anyone even
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.060]  picked that, did they?
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:10.280]  No!
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:12.660]  Everybody left it.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.300]  I thought about it.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.920]  I thought there's no way
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.300]  I'm picking it because I've never seen that.
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.020]  I mean we could
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.000]  even do a thing where we have the
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.580]  ability to drop some we've picked.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:25.960]  Yeah.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.880]  Because I want to pick up
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.760]  a couple of pieces that can work in a trade.
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:34.160]  Like I want to
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:36.040]  trade like obviously dyed
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.680]  hair and double fisting. You know what I mean?
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.740]  I want to make a sweet package
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.440]  for people. Yeah, good luck.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.720]  Like a four team NBA
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.340]  trade to get rid of double fisting.
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.310]  Alright, we're ten minutes from
[01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.930]  clock. I think this guy feels
[01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.110]  about nine inch nails.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.320]  Oh Christ.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.300]  Quiet on a Friday
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.760]  night in, what is this, August?
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.920]  Yeah, I think the rain really
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.260]  dampened spirits.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.240]  It's tough.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.640]  Oh, there's a stupid hat. Oh, it's a lizard.
[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:19.700]  That's a helmet.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:22.940]  It's still a stupid hat, isn't it?
[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.520]  Okay. I don't know.
[01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:25.700]  What do those shirts say?
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.480]  Fist bump!
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.360]  Oh, that was a handshake.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:31.940]  That was a handshake too.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.700]  That was the whole deal.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.240]  That's the guy on my scooter!
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:37.880]  Oh my God!
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.720]  It's popping off!
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.480]  There was a fist bump!
[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.260]  There was a guy on Guy's scooter! So much happened!
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.780]  Did they high five too?
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.160]  No, there was no high five.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.300]  Of course not.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.060]  Fist bump, handshake, hug, Guy on Guy's scooter.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.480]  Wow. What?
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.340]  Get real. To people who are
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:56.520]  named Kevin who aren't Irish.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.200]  Where's the trash man?
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:02.140]  Why is there no trash?
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.060]  Oh man. I don't have much
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.040]  left to fill in.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.300]  I got six.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:15.100]  God.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.580]  Jam. Beach goth.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.060]  Suddenly all the
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.960]  beach goths fled Key West.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.640]  All the meemaws and pawpaws have
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.500]  gone to bed.
[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.900]  I heard they come out
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.220]  at night.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.080]  I want to go back to Key West
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.940]  and I want to eat pizza at that restaurant
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.520]  again that we ate at at the last night.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.600]  Where Burndog
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.460]  coined pleading the second.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.380]  Yeah, pleading the second.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.240]  When he didn't
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.940]  fucking believe that I ate
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.160]  all the ingredients off my pizza.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.340]  I have like
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.780]  my eyes peeled. Oh, camouflage!
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.360]  Holy shit, camo shirt!
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.020]  That was camo shirt.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.660]  God dang it.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:07.800]  Sweet stash.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.200]  Salt life.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.260]  That's not offensive.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.340]  We're looking for a dead parrot head here, man.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.040]  They're not out.
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:17.020]  Too early.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.640]  Too early or too late.
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:20.780]  Too wet.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.220]  It's out of their cycle.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.460]  Look how dry the street is now.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.740]  Doesn't take long, dork.
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.740]  It's still pretty toasty.
[01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:35.270]  That guy's wearing my shorts.
[01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.850]  He sure is.
[01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.930]  Almost a celebrity doppelganger.
[01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:42.110]  No, that looks like a player.
[01:07:43.130 --> 01:07:43.890]  Nah.
[01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:45.690]  What? Nah.
[01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.750]  No.
[01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:49.730]  Nice try, though. I appreciate it.
[01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:50.470]  Yeah.
[01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:52.350]  Alright, let's see.
[01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:54.910]  Cracker barrel.
[01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.850]  Glenn Powell?
[01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:04.050]  Tony Hawk?
[01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.370]  Tried for it so hard.
[01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:15.110]  Volcom?
[01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:16.510]  Volcom.
[01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:18.750]  Jason Momoa?
[01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:19.370]  Yeah.
[01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.290]  Fight.
[01:08:28.030 --> 01:08:29.030]  Look, they're fighting.
[01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.610]  Somebody cry. Let's just go for gold here.
[01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.110]  Only good vibes.
[01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:35.950]  That's not offensive.
[01:08:36.270 --> 01:08:37.230]  That's not offensive?
[01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:38.590]  Not a pink taxi.
[01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.670]  Was that a small child or a doll?
[01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:42.070]  What? Where?
[01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.910]  I didn't see that.
[01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:44.590]  I missed it.
[01:08:45.150 --> 01:08:47.570]  I think it was a doll.
[01:08:49.650 --> 01:08:50.610]  Chats says doll.
[01:08:50.830 --> 01:08:51.410]  Chats says doll.
[01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:56.170]  Are we haunted now?
[01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.590]  I'll tell you.
[01:08:59.050 --> 01:09:00.510]  Key West haunted is not good.
[01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:01.270]  It's real.
[01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:02.790]  I'm pushing a stroller.
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:05.650]  Be careful in the shower tonight or tomorrow.
[01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.930]  I haven't touched any silver recently. I'm good.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:14.300]  She's on the phone.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:16.500]  Phone call, but not about this.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.540]  There's a phone call.
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.220]  But not about this.
[01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.280]  Not about this.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.760]  There's a phone call.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.220]  This is the
[01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:35.140]  making you loony portion of the
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.300]  Bingo that
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.700]  always happens somehow.
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:39.320]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.920]  There's hoofing it at the top again.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.700]  People gotta stop stealing your shorts.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.400]  She's hard hoofing.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.380]  Oh man.
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:49.360]  Did she triple or jump?
[01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:52.760]  It just looked like it was about to get bad.
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.340]  That was a ballsy jump.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.740]  I can't believe our shot
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.160]  at dog and a hog is gone.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:01.560]  You just gotta get a dog.
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.740]  It feels pretty hopeless right now.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:04.940]  Or a hot dog.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.660]  Is that a leather
[01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:13.880]  face shirt?
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.460]  Not quite offensive.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.060]  I don't know man.
[01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:19.340]  I'm scared.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:22.400]  Is that what you think offensive means?
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.760]  I don't know. Hold on.
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:26.660]  Can offensive
[01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:27.480]  mean scared?
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.180]  No.
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.100]  Screw you Google.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.260]  I want
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.380]  this
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.960]  workout clothes woman to get out of here.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.020]  Please move along.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.120]  Get out of here.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.060]  She's talking to Jason Momoa.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.200]  This is like the third person she's been talking to.
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.400]  She just keeps hanging around.
[01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:55.820]  Super social.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:57.780]  Too social.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.520]  Get out of here.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.420]  Desperate to make friends.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.040]  Gavin, if you
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.680]  started a timer on that couple
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.660]  then that was three minutes.
[01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:09.780]  Dude, this is way longer.
[01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:13.680]  No, I don't.
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.700]  Oh, there goes
[01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:16.180]  some honking.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.500]  Do you have that?
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.840]  I sure do.
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.980]  Who did you steal that one off?
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.620]  That guy's got a Lakers shirt.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.380]  I'm offended by that shirt though.
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.280]  I'm a Celtics fan.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.200]  I hate that shirt.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.380]  So do I.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.320]  As a Spurs fan, let's do it.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:36.840]  Offensive?
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:38.420]  No, we can't do it.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:46.110]  It is offensive when they try to claim
[01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.590]  18 titles though.
[01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:51.850]  Bullshit fake
[01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:52.510]  18th title.
[01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:55.150]  That's a dumb hat.
[01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:02.090]  What's the shirt say?
[01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:03.270]  It's got guns on it.
[01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:05.590]  What's the shirt say?
[01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.070]  It's got guns on it.
[01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:09.990]  It had to be a bit offensive.
[01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:12.090]  Lady, move
[01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:12.850]  along.
[01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:15.110]  Move along.
[01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:18.030]  You know what? I would say that was
[01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.970]  a bouncer bouncing.
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:21.870]  What? Picking up litter to throw it away.
[01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.830]  Oh, get real.
[01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.110]  As a bouncer? That's one of the things
[01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.650]  they do.
[01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:29.750]  You've never died somewhere
[01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.590]  of a blonde woman.
[01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.510]  It's not in the spirit of the game.
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:34.150]  Get real.
[01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.070]  Have you ever said, I'm going to do some bouncing and then
[01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:38.050]  clean up your house?
[01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:45.390]  Keeping a clean work environment is considered
[01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:46.910]  a part of everybody's job.
[01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:49.030]  Right, so not bouncing.
[01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:51.610]  Have we had a
[01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:52.530]  separated crosswalk?
[01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.470]  Yes.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.240]  You missed it though, I'm sorry.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.260]  If we did have a separated crosswalk,
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.080]  I didn't mark it.
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.540]  I'm marking this woman
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:05.960]  for move along.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.260]  We almost did, but the guy didn't
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.000]  know the other people.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.180]  Doesn't she have to get moved along?
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.100]  I don't know.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:16.060]  How does move along work?
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.320]  Are these two going to hook up?
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:20.440]  No.
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.960]  High five. Geoff, how does move along work?
[01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.360]  I didn't
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.360]  add move along. I don't know.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.000]  Andrew, how does move along work?
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.680]  I think it's just if they've stuck around too long.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.360]  Okay, cool. Move along it is.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.420]  I marked it. Yeah, but it's more of a camera
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.060]  overstayer.
[01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:38.380]  Yeah, they're not really
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.480]  blocking the path. That's a fair point.
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.540]  That's a very
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.420]  fair point. I think we're at the stage of
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:45.980]  the game now where it's kind of more lenient.
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.160]  You want to mark it? I don't have a problem.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.100]  Is this a fight at the top?
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.220]  Where? Oh! Hang on.
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.940]  Oh, it's popping off.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.920]  It's a fake fight.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.900]  They're doing a
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.140]  dance fight.
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.000]  I just saw one guy run up on the other
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:02.780]  guy and I went, oh fuck.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.520]  There, look, she moved along. Great.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:06.920]  Problem solved.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.960]  Oh, is it not real?
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:10.820]  Hold on.
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:13.960]  Oh, this is some aggressive pointing.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.800]  It feels very aggressive.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.720]  They're in our spot.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:18.920]  I think they're just homies.
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.980]  Oh, they
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.240]  hugged. Oh, they hugged it out.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:24.780]  They worked it out.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.320]  Whoopi Goldberg?
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.320]  She's
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:30.640]  chugging.
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.840]  Starting to sound like Nick, dude.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.980]  Hold on, did you
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.640]  think so?
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.700]  I'm looking for a double chug.
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:41.960]  She's about to chug this.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.980]  Yeah, I'm looking for a double fist and a chug, dude.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.960]  I could use both of those. I could also use some obviously
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.960]  dyed hair, which the Falcons led me astray on.
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:50.740]  No.
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:52.220]  Don't blame the Falcons for your own.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:54.260]  I told the Falcons I would blame them specifically.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.860]  That's a jersey. That's a jersey.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:57.900]  Yes, finally.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.500]  That is two
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.800]  bingos at once for me.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.320]  Really? Three bingos at once.
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:04.800]  Wow.
[01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:06.900]  That's a good one.
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:09.620]  Wow.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.700]  Way to go, dude. Bautista?
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:11.780]  Bautista?
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.280]  It's so
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.100]  fucking funny.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.720]  I love... Celebrity lookalikes are such a good one
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.620]  for Nick because he's just going to call out
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:24.380]  whatever.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.680]  It is slop o'clock officially right now, guys.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:28.800]  This is...
[01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.520]  Garfield jersey. Whoa, look at Garfield.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.580]  That's a sports jersey.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.780]  He's on Garfield.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.320]  Oh, that's great.
[01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.220]  That's a skateboard.
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:39.920]  That's a skateboard.
[01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:42.560]  That rocks. That's so cool.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:43.920]  That was a skateboard, Nick.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.260]  Get real.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:48.660]  It counts.
[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.460]  No, it doesn't.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:51.980]  Garfield's on a skateboard?
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:53.200]  I don't know, man.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.220]  You guys are ridiculous.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.280]  Can I have Bautista?
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.040]  No.
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:01.580]  Alright.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:04.400]  Oh, is this a...
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.920]  Is this a memo?
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.540]  Where am I looking?
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.980]  No, she's...
[01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.460]  No, I don't think so.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.400]  I wish.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.180]  People are driving too fast.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.280]  What's that?
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.160]  What's going on there?
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.680]  What happened?
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:27.980]  She's like, let's go.
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:30.340]  She looked like a goth.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:31.540]  Hmm.
[01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:37.670]  He doesn't know
[01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:38.550]  where the fuck he's going.
[01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:39.330]  Hell no.
[01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.030]  She's walking around, talking on the phone.
[01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:42.330]  Oh.
[01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.950]  Smoking!
[01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:47.490]  Almost getting hit by a car.
[01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.870]  Lack of dead parrot heads tonight, dude.
[01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:54.890]  Yeah, it's wild.
[01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.490]  Zero.
[01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.150]  I need one.
[01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.330]  You know what else I haven't seen, and I'm glad I didn't pick?
[01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:01.390]  Any wheelchairs.
[01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:04.550]  Andrew's learned that lesson.
[01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:05.970]  Honestly, chug
[01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:08.230]  is not happening.
[01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:09.530]  And I can't. That's crazy.
[01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:14.130]  No one's dropped food either.
[01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:17.270]  It always amazes me
[01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.630]  how little puking
[01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:20.730]  happens now compared to
[01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.470]  how much it used to happen when I first
[01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:23.650]  started watching these streams.
[01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.450]  It happens so often
[01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.370]  I put it on and kept it on
[01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.550]  because it kept coming up. And then just now, nothing.
[01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.750]  Never. You never see anybody puking a trash can.
[01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:34.230]  Oh, that man's almost to gurple.
[01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:36.850]  He's close. He is close
[01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:37.410]  to gurple.
[01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:40.730]  I don't think in all the time that we've done this
[01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:42.230]  I've ever seen somebody puke on the stream.
[01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:43.890]  No, I haven't.
[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:46.650]  That'd be such a highlight.
[01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:48.330]  It's great.
[01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:50.610]  I guess somebody in the chat
[01:17:50.610 --> 01:17:52.470]  must have come late because they said no emergency vehicles.
[01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.890]  We had a cop car really early.
[01:17:55.530 --> 01:17:56.510]  And then we had two more.
[01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:57.350]  They came back too.
[01:17:58.290 --> 01:17:59.630]  They were flying through.
[01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:01.650]  I sent Eric a TikTok tonight of a dude
[01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:03.690]  pitching, I think a college pitcher, and he threw
[01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:05.170]  it mid-pitch. It was pretty fucking funny.
[01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:07.710]  It was like a hydrant, dude. It was nuts.
[01:18:08.830 --> 01:18:09.650]  It was in slow motion.
[01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:18.240]  Roll the rubbish out!
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.560]  Jesus Christ.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.460]  They gotta have it.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:23.520]  Where's the rubbish?
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.180]  Oh, there's the rubbish.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.240]  Hey, did you see that TikTok
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.780]  that I sent you, Geoff, with that guy going,
[01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:33.260]  Hey, what's up? It's me, Kevin Garnett.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.720]  Signing some autographs for fans. Did you watch that one?
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:37.080]  No, I haven't seen that yet.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.180]  I sent it to you. I don't know.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.760]  You send me TikToks. I don't know if you ever watch the ones
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.840]  I send you. I look at them all the time.
[01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.160]  I just haven't looked at any TikToks today.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.200]  I'm just being sure. I don't know.
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.460]  It's just a guy going, Hey, what's up? It's me, Kevin Garnett.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.780]  It's not Kevin Garnett, but he's posing with a guy
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:53.200]  who he just signed an autograph for.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.200]  It's so funny.
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.040]  It's so fucking cool.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.300]  It's so cool.
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.820]  That is awesome.
[01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.720]  We saw that bachelorette party go in.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.520]  They were in there a while.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.420]  Oh, they've had a couple.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:08.320]  Thanks.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.780]  They're having fun.
[01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:11.520]  Good times.
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:13.140]  Sweet stash right there.
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:15.800]  Bullet? No.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.740]  He's got stuff on the back of his glasses.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:20.680]  What is this?
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.300]  Is that a whole pizza box?
[01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:23.040]  Yeah.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.620]  No, I was talking about this big stick thing.
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.720]  Yeah, this big stick thing.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.000]  I think it's like an Olympic torch.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.460]  Oh, no, it's a big joint.
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:32.060]  Oh, hug!
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.280]  Where it's always sunny in 72.
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:37.620]  That's not offensive. Come on.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.480]  Oh, it's just he's limping with an umbrella.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:50.880]  I thought that was like an arm cast.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.540]  I'm going to say a lot of injuries tonight.
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:19:58.580]  That's like a camping backpack.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.140]  What the?
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:00.920]  Hug.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:01.700]  Yeah.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:02.800]  Solid hug.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.600]  What a brotherly love tonight.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.340]  No high fives, though.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:10.860]  No.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.200]  No dogs.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.420]  No dogs.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.400]  Real strange.
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:16.440]  Crazy, dude.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.220]  Honestly, not a lot of kids out late either.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.860]  There's some. We've seen some.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:21.660]  Not a lot.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:22.920]  Matching outfits.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.960]  They're all wearing the same shirt.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:27.280]  Wait for the pee paws.
[01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:29.600]  Pee paws.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:32.640]  No dead Barrett heads.
[01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:33.680]  It's fucking nuts, dude.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:34.980]  Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:36.940]  Could use a fight.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.780]  We got close, it felt like.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:40.380]  We did.
[01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.700]  It doesn't have to be a physical altercation.
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.140]  It could be verbal, too.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.440]  It could be an emotional fight.
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:51.260]  That cop car?
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.600]  It just has to be bad vibes.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.920]  Who still needs a bingo?
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.520]  Yeah, who hasn't got one?
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.660]  Me and Geoff got it, right?
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:07.580]  I have one as well.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.520]  I need one still.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.340]  How close are you guys?
[01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:14.540]  I could get an offensive t-shirt,
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.860]  celebrity lookalike, or skateboard.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.640]  I wish whatever that guy was.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.400]  I want to be that guy.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.980]  What do you need, Gavin?
[01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:29.020]  If someone spills
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.080]  food or drink, I've got one.
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.620]  Is that the only one that gets you a bingo?
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:33.800]  Yeah.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:35.800]  Oof.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:37.780]  Andrew really did you dirty on the card.
[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.120]  I'm sure my first card was better.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.760]  The first card was probably fucking great, man.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:43.400]  What do the shirts say?
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:45.920]  Tour.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:47.260]  Where'd he go?
[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:48.820]  It says
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:49.760]  Dickscape.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.080]  We'll be able to read it.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:54.980]  DJ
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:56.060]  Escape.
[01:21:57.300 --> 01:21:59.160]  I guess sometimes
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160]  you just see what you want to see.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.040]  Celebrity lookalike.
[01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.360]  It has to be a celebrity.
[01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:08.900]  Yeah, we're not
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:09.720]  counting Lannan.
[01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:20.670]  Pink taxi, though, maybe.
[01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:22.190]  Any second now.
[01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:23.270]  Just any second now.
[01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:26.350]  You're just putting it out there.
[01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:28.190]  Yeah, just any second now.
[01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:29.830]  That dude's got a giant joint.
[01:22:30.610 --> 01:22:30.830]  Yep.
[01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:34.610]  I think those two guys on scooters are thinking about how better
[01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:35.950]  they'd be with a third guy.
[01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:37.670]  One more.
[01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:40.110]  Ram the gang out.
[01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:42.950]  Oh, man.
[01:22:49.950 --> 01:22:51.330]  You know how they say
[01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:53.550]  if you love what you do, it never
[01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:54.370]  feels like work?
[01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:56.930]  It started to feel like work about
[01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.210]  45 seconds ago.
[01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:00.910]  That's crazy.
[01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:02.670]  Oh my god.
[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:05.530]  How was it at 5.01 when you guys were streaming?
[01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:06.710]  Did you guys celebrate 5.01?
[01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.030]  We ended at 5.01.
[01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:11.310]  Did you really? You clocked out at 5.01?
[01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:12.330]  We did.
[01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:14.590]  That's awesome.
[01:23:15.150 --> 01:23:16.270]  I think that's so cool.
[01:23:16.530 --> 01:23:17.650]  It's for the working man.
[01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:21.070]  Which is funny because we didn't start until about 4.48.
[01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:26.350]  But...
[01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:27.270]  Yeah, you're gonna have
[01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:28.130]  some stethoscopes.
[01:23:29.690 --> 01:23:31.150]  Oh, come on, man.
[01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:32.630]  I say you just leave it, man.
[01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:33.790]  Let the people see it.
[01:23:35.370 --> 01:23:36.870]  Or hear it, I guess.
[01:23:38.910 --> 01:23:39.590]  I don't think
[01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:41.030]  there needs to be a lot of editing, but just
[01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.930]  putting it together.
[01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:45.250]  With Geoff's
[01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:47.510]  footage or yours? Geoff's.
[01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:48.350]  Probably my footage.
[01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:54.370]  No fucking
[01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.310]  beach goss, man.
[01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:57.390]  She's back.
[01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:59.830]  She's fucking back.
[01:24:00.330 --> 01:24:01.370]  Oh, lord.
[01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:03.970]  I told you, man. It was a move along. Absolutely.
[01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:05.930]  This place is her whole fucking identity.
[01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:07.330]  What is up with those gloves?
[01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:08.330]  Fingerless gloves?
[01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:10.350]  That is a look.
[01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.610]  Oh, they all have it.
[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:14.650]  It's part of an outfit.
[01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:16.830]  Has she got a ring pop on?
[01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:18.250]  Yeah, maybe.
[01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:19.730]  Those are delicious.
[01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.650]  When was the last time y'all had a ring pop?
[01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:26.270]  1999?
[01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:30.970]  Maybe we should all
[01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.510]  bring back gloves and ring pops.
[01:24:36.750 --> 01:24:37.870]  I'm with you on the ring pops.
[01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:40.690]  I don't like the way you say that.
[01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:41.310]  I don't either.
[01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:43.310]  I don't know either.
[01:24:44.130 --> 01:24:45.490]  You better hold it up.
[01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.770]  I'm not going low for it,
[01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:49.330]  that's for sure.
[01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:54.010]  I'll suck on your ring pop,
[01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:55.290]  but not if I have to bend over.
[01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:57.630]  What if it's too far?
[01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.350]  What if it's sticking through a hole?
[01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:02.510]  That hasn't come out yet.
[01:25:02.710 --> 01:25:04.170]  That episode is not out yet.
[01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:06.470]  That's next week.
[01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:07.850]  Jesus Christ.
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.130]  Audience, let me tell you,
[01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:11.590]  Gavin is in an era.
[01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:14.350]  Gavin's been on one
[01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:15.310]  every episode.
[01:25:15.630 --> 01:25:17.030]  Bullshit isn't out of your system.
[01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:18.710]  You brought it up again the last time we recorded.
[01:25:19.050 --> 01:25:20.910]  Chug, chug, chug.
[01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:23.470]  Chug, chug, chug.
[01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:24.490]  Chuggy chug chug.
[01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:26.110]  Good job.
[01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:28.170]  Give me obviously dyed hair.
[01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.740]  You need an offensive t-shirt.
[01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:36.940]  Seriously.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:42.480]  I mean, when we were in Key West...
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:42.940]  That's a beach goth.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.300]  That's a beach goth.
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.720]  Another bingo.
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.260]  That's a beach goth.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.540]  I feel like when we were...
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.420]  This guy's cheersing us.
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.960]  That was fucking Ernest Hemingway himself.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.720]  I feel like when we were in Key West,
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.480]  there were more offensive t-shirts
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.940]  than non-offensive t-shirts.
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:02.020]  Yes, I do agree with that.
[01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:02.320]  Yeah.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.920]  Not tonight.
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.860]  So, Gavin and Nick
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.680]  need bingos?
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:10.020]  Yeah.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.740]  This guy spills his drink.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.760]  Looks like he's got a pretty stable grip.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:21.340]  He's got an undershirt. Is it offensive?
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.780]  If I get dead parrot head or camera shy, I got another bingo.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:31.100]  If an actual celebrity appeared,
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.920]  we wouldn't count that as lookalike, right?
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.540]  No.
[01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:36.220]  Because that would just be an actual celebrity.
[01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.260]  Yeah, that would just be them.
[01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:40.080]  Unless they look like another celebrity, too.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.200]  Like Casey Affleck looks kind of like Ben Affleck.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.960]  Right, but I wouldn't call them lookalikes.
[01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:45.960]  I would call them brothers.
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.800]  Yeah, that's true, too.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:50.740]  That's like how I kind of look like my brother.
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.140]  That guy looks like
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.300]  Finn Scott the Engineer.
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.600]  Yeah, but he was smiling,
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.180]  so the effect was on him.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.900]  He didn't have a cloud over him.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.140]  And why am I like him?
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.480]  Because of the way you said that.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:10.140]  Oh, dear.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.700]  I think it's really funny that
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.760]  Gavin and Nick are the two that need bingos.
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.520]  Just thinking about...
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.960]  Oh, that's a meemaw right there.
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.260]  That's a meemaw right there.
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:21.140]  Oh, meemaw.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:22.860]  Bingo!
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:23.800]  Again.
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.020]  That's Pawpaw right next to her.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.120]  I don't know about that, but that is definitely a meemaw.
[01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.140]  I don't think that's a Pawpaw.
[01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.760]  Not a Pawpaw, but that's fine.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.100]  What appears to be happening is
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.200]  there is an emergency vehicle
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.020]  just off camera to the left-hand side
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:40.440]  and it is blocking a lane.
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.640]  Because people cannot go this way.
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:44.900]  Hoofing it, hoofing it.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.080]  Yeah, big time hoofing it.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:48.600]  Oh, so we got some drama.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.120]  That's what it looks like.
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.340]  Another car just pulled in behind this car
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:54.240]  and turned around.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.260]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:27:58.640]  Look, Nick, people in the front and the back seat. Clown car?
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.620]  The windows are open.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.280]  Pretty crazy, man.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:06.080]  How can they all do that?
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.680]  No, it's a truck anyway.
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.660]  Oh, okay, cool.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.980]  Oh, we passed slop o'clock and didn't even realize it.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.880]  Everyone cooled out.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.900]  Yeah, we all cooled out.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.220]  Then we had a whole conversation
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.920]  about 501, so I'm not sure
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.620]  where you've been for the last 13 minutes.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.300]  We passed slop o'clock
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.220]  and I didn't even notice.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:28.760]  He was back at 501.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.500]  We said it and everyone in the chat said it.
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:38.880]  So I only have
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.820]  four more left to fill out. What about you, Eric?
[01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:41.720]  Hell of a cowboy hat.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.100]  Five.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:47.640]  Geoff has five. How many do you have, Eric?
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.800]  One, two, three, four,
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.240]  five, six, seven, eight.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.200]  Oh, wow.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.120]  So you won and then it kind of cooled off.
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:57.780]  Yeah, really cooled off.
[01:28:58.060 --> 01:29:00.440]  Yeah, so you got lucky in your layout.
[01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:02.860]  Yeah, I'll let you know how lucky
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.880]  I am while I'm eating my cake.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.760]  I mean, we haven't gotten a cake yet.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.080]  We've done like five of these.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.840]  Yeah, but now this is
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:11.560]  us, baby.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.420]  Alright, well I'm going with you when you get the cake.
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.140]  No, solo cake trip.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:17.960]  No, I'm going to get my...
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.340]  No, no, uh-uh.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.580]  Just making noises.
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.000]  Pink taxi
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.480]  any second now, maybe.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:29.960]  We're blocking, like
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.000]  there's like whole lanes blocked here, dude. Like people can't
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:32.800]  come down this way.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.840]  It could be one right behind this white
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.940]  SUV. This next car coming
[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.760]  up, it could be a pink taxi. It's not.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:42.120]  It's this guy, but...
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:42.620]  Bye, gang.
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:44.480]  Do we want to put like a
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:46.280]  ten minute timer?
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.180]  Is that pawpaw? I think so.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.240]  Let's do a ten minute timer. That's pawpaw.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:52.000]  Yes, that's absolutely a pawpaw.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.580]  Yeah, let's do it. Let's say ten more
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.340]  minutes and then we're good.
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.600]  Alright, ten minutes. I have eight left. Here we go.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.560]  I'm just one dog and a hog at this
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.580]  point. Yeah, personal victory.
[01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.730]  Okay,
[01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:08.930]  alright. Obviously dyed
[01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.830]  hair, Falcons made me
[01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:12.870]  pick it, and here we are in a place
[01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:14.370]  where we have not gotten it.
[01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:16.010]  Upsetting.
[01:30:16.210 --> 01:30:18.410]  Frustrating. Bradley Cooper
[01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:20.030]  again. Holy shit.
[01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.890]  Again?
[01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:23.670]  Wow, twice?
[01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:28.250]  Firetruck's here, baby!
[01:30:28.930 --> 01:30:30.090]  Things are escalating.
[01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:32.310]  Watch the chat start going off about firetruck,
[01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.850]  firetruck!
[01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:38.370]  These are fucking out of
[01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:39.790]  control across the street at
[01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:40.770]  Rick's.
[01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:41.110]  Yeah.
[01:30:43.210 --> 01:30:44.870]  That's what it is, Rick's, I think.
[01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:46.990]  That guy's got a hog.
[01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:48.270]  Oh, wow!
[01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:49.770]  Oh, we're just getting out right here!
[01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:50.910]  Oh, shit!
[01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:52.070]  Clown car!
[01:30:54.610 --> 01:30:55.690]  Seriously going on.
[01:30:56.690 --> 01:30:57.850]  All the firetruck guys.
[01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.250]  I wonder if it was a shootout.
[01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:01.210]  It's not a clown truck.
[01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.990]  Hmm.
[01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:07.030]  Well, they're dressed the same.
[01:31:07.290 --> 01:31:07.450]  Yeah.
[01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:09.830]  Oh, those are some moves!
[01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:11.430]  Those are moves.
[01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:12.570]  There's a hog. Where's dog?
[01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.990]  No dog.
[01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:15.530]  Not yet.
[01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:19.190]  I'm gonna look at the other sloppy Joe's camera
[01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:20.570]  to see if I can see what's going on.
[01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:21.370]  Oh, good idea.
[01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:24.390]  If you're gonna do that, just look at the Rick's camera.
[01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:26.910]  It's of that fucking building.
[01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:29.110]  The Rick's camera.
[01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.830]  The zoomed out shot is just the top of the firetruck.
[01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:33.170]  Hold on a second.
[01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:34.010]  YouTube.
[01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:36.150]  Uh, YouTube.
[01:31:37.150 --> 01:31:38.750]  Are we gonna have to put a warning on this video?
[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:43.610]  For the flashing lights?
[01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:44.410]  Yeah, probably.
[01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:46.750]  Might as well. Just put it in the description.
[01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:49.310]  It's like a Twin Rivers Digital or whatever.
[01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:52.130]  Where'd they go?
[01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.950]  What?
[01:31:54.130 --> 01:31:56.530]  The people that run the cameras.
[01:31:57.370 --> 01:31:57.590]  Oh.
[01:31:58.190 --> 01:32:01.170]  You said that like it's the common parlance.
[01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.650]  Twin Rivers Digital.
[01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:04.230]  The thing we always say.
[01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:06.150]  I mean, I...
[01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:07.830]  Those are the people I...
[01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:10.590]  We had a whole story about how I called them on the weekend
[01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:11.830]  to let them know the cameras were down.
[01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.890]  That's so funny.
[01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:18.630]  She's got... She has this fucking cool-ass
[01:32:18.630 --> 01:32:20.010]  Coors hat, dude. That's sick.
[01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:21.850]  Uh-oh.
[01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:24.110]  No one's even calling you dickhead, dude.
[01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.190]  Uh-oh.
[01:32:29.190 --> 01:32:30.150]  Oh, okay.
[01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:31.350]  What team is she on?
[01:32:32.370 --> 01:32:33.250]  Team what?
[01:32:33.650 --> 01:32:33.750]  Team.
[01:32:36.690 --> 01:32:38.410]  Shirtwear is gonna call out team?
[01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:40.490]  Two Oceans Digital.
[01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.590]  Her shirt hat.
[01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:43.750]  What's on the back of your shirt?
[01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:48.770]  They're watching the camera. Let's see if they...
[01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:50.690]  It's an offensive hat.
[01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:51.750]  It has titties on it.
[01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:53.270]  It did say titties.
[01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.050]  Maybe the back of her shirt
[01:32:57.050 --> 01:32:58.410]  says something equivalent.
[01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:01.050]  Come on.
[01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:02.650]  What does it say?
[01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:03.210]  What does it say?
[01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:07.330]  It's like all the fucking cameras are down.
[01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:10.170]  Oh, now here we go.
[01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:11.230]  Conspiracy!
[01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:16.950]  What does your shirt say?
[01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.970]  Oh.
[01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:22.390]  That's a selfie.
[01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:23.990]  Yeah, they took them all down.
[01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.610]  That's so weird.
[01:33:24.970 --> 01:33:27.910]  You gotta call somebody over the weekend.
[01:33:31.570 --> 01:33:32.170]  They're having fun.
[01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:33.370]  Yeah, I guess I probably should.
[01:33:33.970 --> 01:33:34.890]  They're taking their picture.
[01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:36.370]  They're having fun.
[01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:41.250]  That shirt of Florida is offensive.
[01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:50.760]  Perfect picture for the VOD.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.320]  We have to use that.
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.480]  We have to use that for the VOD.
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.580]  This has to be done now.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.560]  Now with him doing that.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.080]  That's the best phone booth ever.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:11.640]  That is great.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.500]  That's so funny.
[01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.220]  Did anybody
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.060]  try to get a screenshot?
[01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:19.820]  No, I just have to grab it off the video.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:20.680]  That was so funny.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.100]  Let me see what time that is.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:23.980]  Now we're at 38.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:27.880]  Where's my phone?
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.680]  I'm gonna write that down.
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.380]  Alright, hour 38.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:35.020]  Anybody see my friend?
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:37.580]  He's an old man with a stick and pink shorts.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.560]  I was looking for him.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.620]  I said we'd meet up here.
[01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.300]  I'm his Uber driver.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.760]  I think we got about six minutes left
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.920]  before we shut it down.
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:50.940]  How are you guys feeling about trying to get this
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:52.620]  bingo?
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:54.480]  Impossible.
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:56.460]  There's no hogs, there's no dogs.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:58.900]  Just
[01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:00.400]  think about how good our cards would have been
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.140]  the first time, dude.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.000]  Maybe because
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.840]  it's so hot, people are being
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:09.960]  responsible dog owners and keeping
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.220]  them inside in the air conditioning.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.820]  Not in Florida, they're not.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.020]  Maybe all the people
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.260]  in Florida are being responsible.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.000]  I'm just trying to glass half full it.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:20.360]  You know?
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.020]  This guy seems so happy.
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:24.960]  You know who that guy looks like?
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.660]  Talk about celebrity look alike.
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:28.380]  That's Chris Christie right there.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:31.100]  He's right. I'm going to mark it.
[01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:35.980]  Nick is desperate.
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:39.020]  Let me have it. It'll give me a bingo for the first time
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:40.940]  in ages. He's doing a bit
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:41.920]  where he's hitchhiking.
[01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:52.630]  What?
[01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:55.350]  This would be a great opportunity for a white
[01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:56.970]  or a pink taxi to roll up.
[01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:58.470]  I don't want it to be white, actually.
[01:36:06.710 --> 01:36:07.810]  Bachelorette party.
[01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:14.330]  Oh, suck it on a chili dog.
[01:36:16.330 --> 01:36:17.530]  Hell yeah.
[01:36:17.610 --> 01:36:19.330]  Eat it baby. Right in your mouth.
[01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:20.310]  You put it right in your mouth.
[01:36:21.090 --> 01:36:22.150]  He's dogging.
[01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:23.910]  We need a hog.
[01:36:25.090 --> 01:36:27.230]  That's a chili dog train.
[01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:28.370]  They still have hot dogs.
[01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:30.310]  It's a dog convoy.
[01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.710]  They're all gone.
[01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:34.050]  No other dog.
[01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:35.530]  Oh, man.
[01:36:35.970 --> 01:36:37.770]  That's another bingo. Thank you.
[01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:38.230]  Thank you.
[01:36:38.850 --> 01:36:43.270]  Gavin, we drafted like shit.
[01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:46.070]  And who would have thought
[01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:48.150]  that would have been a suck it on a chili dog convoy
[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:48.710]  at the end there.
[01:36:49.290 --> 01:36:49.770]  Unbelievable.
[01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:52.970]  The dog train, man.
[01:36:53.490 --> 01:36:55.350]  Got three minutes left.
[01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:56.150]  Yep.
[01:36:59.190 --> 01:37:00.870]  I'm just going to buy myself a piece of cake.
[01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.470]  Opportunity
[01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:05.370]  for an offensive t-shirt
[01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.470]  to roll up.
[01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:11.090]  This guy's back for like a fifth time.
[01:37:12.250 --> 01:37:13.410]  Ron Howard?
[01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:19.850]  Do you think she's having a fight with somebody on the phone right now?
[01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:25.600]  Is she crying?
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:27.120]  She looks troubled.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.420]  She does.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:32.380]  Why are the only shirts I can read in offensive?
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:33.520]  Florida.
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.420]  That's offensive.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:36.360]  Moose.
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.800]  Nobody's going to get into a fight
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.080]  in front of the fire truck.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.860]  John McEnroe?
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:53.620]  Oh, we got a weed thing.
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.920]  Get a photo.
[01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:56.500]  Lean back.
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.660]  That guy's Seth Rogen.
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:01.260]  Wow.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.220]  He'd love that.
[01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:06.420]  He'd love it.
[01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:10.700]  That guy took a photo.
[01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:12.460]  Must be something interesting.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.240]  I'll tell you what's...
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:15.340]  No! No!
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:17.280]  That looked like it was offensive.
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:18.680]  That's unfortunate.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.300]  It was about society.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:33.660]  That's pretty formal.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:36.240]  Pink taxi.
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:41.020]  Dopey?
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:42.840]  Pink taxi.
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:45.180]  Dopey?
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:46.900]  One of the dwarves?
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:47.180]  Yeah.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:51.400]  Oh, you got one minute.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:52.400]  Yep.
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:54.160]  One minute for a hundred dog.
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.180]  Captain Ahab?
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:58.260]  How about after we wrap up, we raid BK?
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:38:59.400]  I see BK streaming.
[01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.160]  Yeah, let's do that.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:01.620]  Sure.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:07.020]  I think she's doing a sub-a-thon, so that's really going to screw her.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.040]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:10.180]  Awesome.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.100]  You're laughing.
[01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:14.760]  That's going to add so many hours.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.420]  Hey, that guy's sucking on a chili dog right now.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.840]  Alright, keep an eye out for Hogs.
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.180]  Keep your eyes out for your dolls.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.440]  What's her name, Andrew?
[01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.820]  Black Crystal?
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:25.920]  With a K?
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:27.860]  Got it.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:28.460]  One word.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:34.400]  Man, there's a lot of people right now.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.340]  Yeah, there are.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.520]  It's really popping off.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.940]  So this guy's just eating a chili dog right in the middle of everything.
[01:39:39.940 --> 01:39:41.540]  Oh, Hogs!
[01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.820]  Keep an eye out for Hogs.
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.940]  Dude, could you imagine in the last minute?
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.220]  Could you imagine in the last minute a dog and a hog?
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.660]  Could you imagine?
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.300]  I would flip my desk.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:55.580]  Hell yeah, man!
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:56.860]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.120]  Robert Irvine, the chef? There he goes!
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.940]  Oh, that's Megan Fox down there.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:05.400]  Yeah, it sure is.
[01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:10.470]  Can we get one for Slang?
[01:40:10.810 --> 01:40:11.930]  Gavin, he's still going.
[01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:13.410]  He's still eating the dog, dude.
[01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:14.910]  He's wiping his hand in his pocket.
[01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:17.950]  Just one guy on a big ol' bike
[01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:19.310]  just come through right now, son!
[01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:20.870]  Come on, just explore it.
[01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.730]  Oh, what's this in the background?
[01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:25.110]  What's this? What's this behind that car?
[01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:26.970]  What? It's a bike.
[01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:29.390]  A bicycle? A frickin' bicycle.
[01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:33.010]  Oh, he's like waggling that dog.
[01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:34.730]  Oh, he's still...
[01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:36.070]  Oh, no!
[01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:37.890]  Technically, it's still in his mouth.
[01:40:38.170 --> 01:40:38.830]  He's still chewing.
[01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:41.170]  Once he swallows, it's gone, though.
[01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:44.230]  Come on, right here. Motorcycle.
[01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:45.030]  Right now.
[01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:48.710]  Come careening down the street, irresponsibly.
[01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:49.630]  Oh, Gavin.
[01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.610]  Go get another one.
[01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:52.430]  Gavin, I'm so sorry.
[01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:55.670]  Well, guys, we did it.
[01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:59.650]  Another Sloppy Joe's bingo in the books.
[01:41:00.090 --> 01:41:01.190]  That was a great one.
[01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:01.950]  I win again.
[01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:04.130]  I'm thinking about what kind of
[01:41:04.710 --> 01:41:05.670]  cake I want.
[01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:06.870]  Very excited to eat it.
[01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:10.070]  Guys, Sloppy Joe's bingo happens not super often,
[01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:11.410]  but it's always fun when it does.
[01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:13.030]  We want to thank you for watching us live.
[01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:15.690]  Go to patreon.com slash the regulation pod
[01:41:15.690 --> 01:41:17.650]  if you want to see how we got the bingo
[01:41:18.130 --> 01:41:19.730]  scorecards that we ended up with.
[01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:21.710]  If you're a falcon or above.
[01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:23.190]  Check out...
[01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:24.530]  What do we have coming out this Sunday?
[01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:27.090]  We have...
[01:41:27.090 --> 01:41:28.410]  Some fresh new content.
[01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:30.950]  The Breakfast Foods draft
[01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:32.750]  for Bog, Standard, and Above.
[01:41:32.890 --> 01:41:34.510]  So at least you're a Bog, Standard member.
[01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:35.950]  You get a draft.
[01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:38.750]  Thank you so much, guys, for joining us here.
[01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:40.630]  Guys, any final thoughts
[01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:42.770]  for the folks at home before we send it over to BK?
[01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.030]  You know what?
[01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:45.490]  I would draft Dog and a Hog again.
[01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:46.610]  I would do it again.
[01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:49.610]  I'm sticking with Pink Taxi.
[01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.830]  I believe.
[01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:54.250]  Dog and a Hog. Ride or die.
[01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:57.310]  Okay, we'll see you next time.
[01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:57.890]  Bye!
[01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:00.730]  Bye, everyone!
[01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:03.570]  Taxi.
[01:42:06.330 --> 01:42:07.550]  Alright, slowly raiding.
[01:42:07.670 --> 01:42:08.090]  We have seven.
[01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:11.290]  What happens with the raid is that you have to start it
[01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:12.950]  and then you have to give it a little bit of time.
[01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:13.390]  Yup.
[01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:16.690]  So what's happening now is we're learning.
[01:42:17.710 --> 01:42:18.110]  Yup. Goodbye.
[01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:21.070]  Bye. Love you. Bye. Bye.
