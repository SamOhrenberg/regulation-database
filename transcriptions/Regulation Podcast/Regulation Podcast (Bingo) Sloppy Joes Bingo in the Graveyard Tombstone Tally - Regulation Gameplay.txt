[00:00.700 --> 00:01.660]  Tombstone Tally.
[00:02.200 --> 00:05.260]  So this is a game that a regulation developer made.
[00:05.360 --> 00:05.960]  Is that what's happening?
[00:06.420 --> 00:11.220]  That is. Yeah, it's Geoff's inspired idea of Tombstone Bingo.
[00:11.660 --> 00:13.060]  Wow. Dude.
[00:13.140 --> 00:15.580]  Which I still stand by as a respectful idea.
[00:16.220 --> 00:18.300]  It's not. Well, it isn't this.
[00:19.720 --> 00:21.100]  Watch out for shovel attackers.
[00:21.720 --> 00:24.680]  Oh, I'm going to I'm going to fucking out bingo, Eric.
[00:24.740 --> 00:26.100]  Finally, this is great.
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.000]  Whoa, this is crazy.
[00:29.000 --> 00:30.160]  All right, what's on my list?
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.420]  Inventing accident name alliteration.
[00:34.260 --> 00:35.140]  Stride fighting.
[00:35.820 --> 00:39.380]  Wow. Do I have to like look and cross them off
[00:39.380 --> 00:41.440]  or do they just cross them off when I find it?
[00:42.620 --> 00:43.600]  Check the tally card.
[00:44.240 --> 00:46.500]  Oh, no, I can't invert fuck.
[00:48.520 --> 00:49.860]  Well, it's not a plane, Nick.
[00:49.920 --> 00:51.360]  You're not flying a plane. It's just legs.
[00:52.740 --> 00:54.300]  What games are flying?
[00:54.500 --> 00:55.820]  I don't know. Oh, man.
[00:56.360 --> 00:57.980]  Oh, man. OK.
[00:58.420 --> 01:00.320]  The last words. This sucks.
[01:00.620 --> 01:03.780]  Oh, wow. Really? That's awesome.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.940]  Tested Murphy's Law. Yeah.
[01:09.020 --> 01:11.020]  I don't have waxed to death.
[01:11.460 --> 01:14.020]  Some of these are great. Job related heart attack.
[01:14.160 --> 01:16.560]  Walked right under a falling pain.
[01:18.280 --> 01:20.760]  Death by disco struck by object.
[01:20.880 --> 01:21.720]  These are great.
[01:23.580 --> 01:27.600]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:27.600 --> 01:29.520]  The fucking groundskeeper.
[01:29.720 --> 01:31.260]  I got one. I got one.
[01:31.320 --> 01:34.180]  Willie, you ate too many hot dogs.
[01:34.740 --> 01:38.460]  What? Oh,
[01:40.720 --> 01:41.680]  Jesus Christ.
[01:41.720 --> 01:42.560]  What happened?
[01:42.900 --> 01:44.460]  Just smacked Derek with a shovel.
[01:44.740 --> 01:46.020]  I'm I'm stuck.
[01:48.340 --> 01:49.860]  What the fuck was that?
[01:50.120 --> 01:53.140]  Oh, I was saying this is what I was fearful of.
[01:53.200 --> 01:54.100]  He put it in the game.
[01:54.360 --> 01:56.420]  I was afraid a groundskeeper would get us.
[01:57.600 --> 02:00.000]  Some groundskeeper who doesn't understand what we're doing.
[02:00.140 --> 02:00.940]  That wasn't the groundskeeper.
[02:03.320 --> 02:03.720]  Andrew.
[02:04.440 --> 02:05.460]  No. Well, anything cool?
[02:05.900 --> 02:06.300]  Not yet.
[02:06.400 --> 02:08.360]  Whack the fuck out of this groundskeeper.
[02:08.560 --> 02:09.580]  How did you get a shovel?
[02:10.180 --> 02:10.900]  You can't just.
[02:11.140 --> 02:12.440]  I know. No, no, no.
[02:13.320 --> 02:15.380]  What's funny is the first time I swung at you, Eric,
[02:15.440 --> 02:18.680]  the groundskeeper swung at me and he saved your life like frame perfectly.
[02:19.340 --> 02:20.280]  Oh, my God.
[02:20.540 --> 02:21.840]  Their last words were this sucks.
[02:22.340 --> 02:24.080]  Oh, falling piano. Did I have that?
[02:25.880 --> 02:27.140]  We're getting out of here.
[02:27.180 --> 02:28.300]  Get away from me.
[02:28.460 --> 02:28.880]  No.
[02:36.230 --> 02:40.310]  Let's play tennis with Eric.
[02:41.970 --> 02:43.450]  I'm trying to win bingo.
[02:43.630 --> 02:44.590]  Stay away from me.
[02:44.630 --> 02:46.570]  Oh shit, it's the groundskeeper.
[02:47.070 --> 02:49.690]  So one of the options I saw was
[02:50.850 --> 02:53.290]  shovels are infinite, so you never have to find another one.
[02:53.530 --> 02:54.010]  We can just keep.
[02:54.530 --> 02:56.050]  Oh, there's one over here.
[02:56.050 --> 02:59.350]  That is a dying, trying to high five on a jet ski.
[02:59.830 --> 03:01.970]  Slipped while shaving in the yard.
[03:04.710 --> 03:06.730]  Dude, this game is awesome.
[03:06.970 --> 03:09.770]  Fell off a stack of standing desks to there.
[03:11.010 --> 03:12.610]  Did you all see this one?
[03:12.810 --> 03:16.250]  Good. Was was strangled by a supposed friend.
[03:16.670 --> 03:18.370]  This is so cool again.
[03:19.410 --> 03:20.490]  You'll never get me, son.
[03:22.150 --> 03:23.490]  I'm going to hide behind this man.
[03:23.930 --> 03:24.890]  Sounds good. Oh, God.
[03:27.270 --> 03:28.870]  How do I hold up a red rag?
[03:31.370 --> 03:32.730]  How am I not find it?
[03:33.390 --> 03:36.750]  Oh, yeah, I'm swinging on this one.
[03:36.870 --> 03:38.110]  Ain't too many hot dogs.
[03:39.510 --> 03:41.690]  Pulled a perfect heist hit by the getaway car.
[03:42.790 --> 03:45.510]  Oh, I got one. I got one.
[03:45.890 --> 03:46.850]  What'd you get? Yeah.
[03:47.370 --> 03:49.550]  A rip. Oh, nice.
[03:52.330 --> 03:56.390]  Hey, Eric, built and built and killed by their time machine.
[03:56.450 --> 03:59.650]  That invented it.
[03:59.670 --> 04:01.050]  It's coming for us.
[04:02.910 --> 04:05.210]  The grasskeeper just whacked him.
[04:05.750 --> 04:11.290]  This this is so you have to like be so fast and like, OK, look at these things.
[04:11.290 --> 04:12.850]  Oh, is that on my list? Oh, this is so great.
[04:13.210 --> 04:15.570]  Yeah, I'm really struggling to take in what's on my card.
[04:15.990 --> 04:18.070]  Poisoned by a bad pastrami sandwich.
[04:18.530 --> 04:19.210]  Oh, that's great.
[04:19.750 --> 04:20.970]  Geoff, look out behind you.
[04:21.010 --> 04:21.750]  Oh, shit.
[04:22.590 --> 04:23.590]  Oh, that was good.
[04:24.010 --> 04:26.230]  You said Geoff, but I didn't move.
[04:30.270 --> 04:31.910]  Can you hit the groundskeeper back?
[04:32.950 --> 04:33.570]  I don't know.
[04:33.850 --> 04:35.410]  Ah, he's on me.
[04:36.410 --> 04:37.210]  Oh, I hit him.
[04:37.530 --> 04:38.630]  No, I defended myself.
[04:38.950 --> 04:40.550]  I got another one. I got another one.
[04:43.230 --> 04:46.210]  I kind of wish I could keep my thing open and walk.
[04:46.530 --> 04:48.170]  I know, makes it a little more complicated.
[04:48.790 --> 04:50.710]  Caught fire on the dance floor.
[04:51.410 --> 04:51.950]  Helen died.
[04:52.670 --> 04:55.190]  Died fighting, born before sliced bread.
[04:57.550 --> 04:59.210]  Where are you guys?
[04:59.370 --> 05:01.170]  I'm still in like this first graveyard.
[05:03.190 --> 05:05.490]  Flipped one too many coins and lost.
[05:05.870 --> 05:06.350]  Oh, my God.
[05:06.910 --> 05:08.490]  Attacked by a swan.
[05:10.730 --> 05:14.050]  Suffered root, suffered too many root canals and kicked the bucket.
[05:16.590 --> 05:18.270]  Oh, God damn it.
[05:18.270 --> 05:19.230]  Me grave.
[05:19.550 --> 05:20.850]  Just got rattled.
[05:22.350 --> 05:23.230]  What's up, Gavin?
[05:23.570 --> 05:24.450]  How many have you found, Gavin?
[05:24.830 --> 05:26.090]  This person's alive still?
[05:26.350 --> 05:26.970]  Found two.
[05:27.310 --> 05:28.830]  Oh, faked their own death.
[05:30.570 --> 05:32.090]  It just says, till present.
[05:32.970 --> 05:34.030]  I haven't found any yet.
[05:34.890 --> 05:37.610]  I'm also, it's hard to pay attention.
[05:38.250 --> 05:40.210]  Who the fuck is hitting me?
[05:40.470 --> 05:42.030]  Oh, it's Eric, you piece of shit.
[05:42.390 --> 05:42.910]  Ow!
[05:44.170 --> 05:44.610]  Jesus.
[05:45.590 --> 05:47.150]  I just keep whacking Andrew.
[05:48.830 --> 05:49.870]  Yeah, I got three.
[05:49.890 --> 05:50.430]  Dude, there's too many.
[05:51.830 --> 05:55.170]  I keep, I fucking found so many that aren't me.
[05:55.270 --> 05:56.270]  I hit the groundskeeper.
[05:56.890 --> 05:57.490]  Fuck you.
[05:57.550 --> 05:58.090]  No, Andrew.
[06:01.290 --> 06:05.170]  It's so funny to be looking at a grave and to see someone sailing through the air in the background.
[06:07.590 --> 06:09.670]  Man, where are all my deads?
[06:10.690 --> 06:12.010]  Oh, oh, oh.
[06:12.790 --> 06:14.110]  That's one? Oh, shit.
[06:14.670 --> 06:15.350]  I got it!
[06:15.690 --> 06:16.770]  Oh, Eric, hold up your card again.
[06:17.490 --> 06:20.270]  Wow, I can see your card, that's so good.
[06:20.550 --> 06:21.790]  Damn, that's cool.
[06:22.090 --> 06:22.830]  You got loads.
[06:23.810 --> 06:24.710]  I'm finding them.
[06:25.830 --> 06:27.310]  Oh, man, they're all over the woods, though.
[06:28.730 --> 06:29.330]  Uh-oh.
[06:30.030 --> 06:31.090]  I did see that one somewhere.
[06:33.070 --> 06:33.450]  Hey.
[06:35.070 --> 06:36.390]  You don't have a shovel, do you?
[06:36.770 --> 06:37.310]  What's going on?
[06:38.890 --> 06:40.170]  You can take it out.
[06:42.130 --> 06:44.230]  Dude, this game's not bad.
[06:44.230 --> 06:44.770]  Oh, Gavin, look!
[06:45.230 --> 06:45.810]  This is fantastic.
[06:46.630 --> 06:47.890]  This is really cool.
[06:49.350 --> 06:51.090]  I'm trying to read, dude!
[06:51.650 --> 06:53.650]  Where are these other gravestones, man?
[06:53.870 --> 06:54.790]  No, no, no!
[06:55.390 --> 06:55.610]  No!
[06:56.110 --> 06:56.990]  Oh, what's over here?
[06:59.650 --> 07:00.510]  Can't fire.
[07:04.340 --> 07:04.840]  Oh, shit.
[07:05.240 --> 07:07.180]  The AI of this groundskeeper is pretty advanced.
[07:07.360 --> 07:09.280]  He just hopped a stone.
[07:10.260 --> 07:11.020]  He stone-hopped?
[07:11.740 --> 07:12.220]  Yeah.
[07:13.180 --> 07:14.740]  Gotta watch out for stone-hoppers.
[07:16.960 --> 07:18.640]  Oh, I heard you fucking swing!
[07:19.020 --> 07:19.880]  I heard a swing!
[07:22.420 --> 07:24.300]  Oh, shit, he got me on the backswing.
[07:25.100 --> 07:25.840]  Oh, balls.
[07:27.080 --> 07:30.040]  Beaten by the British Jackal with a cricket bat.
[07:34.540 --> 07:38.500]  How did you do that?
[07:39.400 --> 07:40.060]  Hop up here?
[07:40.900 --> 07:41.080]  Yeah.
[07:41.080 --> 07:41.620]  Parkour?
[07:44.080 --> 07:44.500]  Parkour?
[07:46.220 --> 07:47.320]  Okay, where's all the good
[07:49.200 --> 07:50.280]  frickin' tombstones?
[07:50.780 --> 07:51.940]  The good ones?
[07:52.240 --> 07:53.680]  I'm having so much trouble finding any.
[07:53.780 --> 07:54.760]  Oh, shit. Okay.
[07:59.360 --> 08:00.320]  I'll get you right back, son.
[08:00.600 --> 08:01.640]  How about just died enough?
[08:01.940 --> 08:03.860]  How about just died enough?
[08:04.700 --> 08:04.880]  What?
[08:05.760 --> 08:06.300]  Gavin!
[08:13.050 --> 08:14.950]  Alright, how about this? I'll jump into you
[08:14.950 --> 08:16.590]  and you hit me like I'm a bull.
[08:17.070 --> 08:18.130]  Alright, here we go. Ready?
[08:26.520 --> 08:28.720]  How many groundskeepers are there? Just the one?
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.900]  I think it's just the one, but he follows us.
[08:30.940 --> 08:32.780]  Is it? How am I getting hit so much?
[08:34.240 --> 08:35.240]  He's good at finding you.
[08:35.900 --> 08:37.140]  I didn't even see where you went, Nick.
[08:38.360 --> 08:40.700]  I landed over by these, uh...
[08:40.700 --> 08:41.320]  Oh, rip.
[08:43.680 --> 08:46.800]  Is it like, he's programmed it so that if I join
[08:46.800 --> 08:48.680]  none of my shit is on a tombstone?
[08:49.580 --> 08:51.140]  Andrew's one square away.
[08:51.200 --> 08:52.720]  Guys, Andrew's about to win.
[08:52.860 --> 08:54.480]  Eric has had it for longer.
[08:54.920 --> 08:56.360]  I haven't found one yet.
[08:56.360 --> 08:56.900]  What does that matter?
[08:58.580 --> 09:02.020]  No, there's more than one groundskeeper.
[09:03.200 --> 09:04.580]  Oh, he's not invincible.
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.320]  You killed him?
[09:07.620 --> 09:08.140]  I hit him.
[09:08.300 --> 09:09.860]  Yeah, I knocked the shit out of him a few times.
[09:10.340 --> 09:12.180]  He shakes it off.
[09:12.980 --> 09:13.140]  Yeah.
[09:13.880 --> 09:15.280]  Momentary time to anvil.
[09:15.520 --> 09:16.260]  Death by lava.
[09:16.920 --> 09:17.320]  Ligma.
[09:18.920 --> 09:19.860]  Ligma ball!
[09:20.180 --> 09:22.360]  Died in a shootout with the boys of Dumpty.
[09:24.580 --> 09:26.580]  That jacket was to die for.
[09:27.900 --> 09:28.940]  This is...
[09:28.940 --> 09:30.800]  This has got some lore in it.
[09:31.240 --> 09:31.760]  Yeah!
[09:33.320 --> 09:33.840]  Shit!
[09:34.180 --> 09:34.680]  Bingo!
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.420]  I want to know, I want to see how many of the ones...
[09:39.420 --> 09:39.820]  Oh, damn it!
[09:39.820 --> 09:41.600]  Look at that, I didn't see anything.
[09:41.880 --> 09:44.420]  How did you not see anything? They're all over the place.
[09:44.600 --> 09:45.000]  I don't know.
[09:45.120 --> 09:48.400]  I don't see any of mine circled on anybody else's.
[09:48.720 --> 09:49.420]  Let me see.
[09:49.460 --> 09:51.540]  I'm looking at Gavin's.
[09:52.280 --> 09:52.660]  Poisoned.
[09:52.740 --> 09:54.040]  Died fighting.
[09:56.060 --> 09:57.220]  Death by choking.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.740]  Candles on the grave.
[10:01.120 --> 10:02.540]  There were definitely candles on graves.
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.520]  Died laughing.
[10:04.520 --> 10:06.800]  Could have seen Star Wars in the theater
[10:06.800 --> 10:08.660]  as people that were alive in the 70s
[10:08.660 --> 10:09.900]  through the 90s.
[10:11.100 --> 10:12.500]  Crushed by an object.
[10:13.620 --> 10:14.460]  Name alliteration
[10:14.460 --> 10:15.680]  is just two letters.
[10:16.660 --> 10:18.980]  Killed by a friend, there were so many of those.
[10:19.240 --> 10:20.940]  Has a quote, there are a bunch of those.
[10:22.300 --> 10:23.580]  Alright, I know how to play now.
[10:24.460 --> 10:25.800]  I know how to play now.
[10:28.500 --> 10:30.420]  Do you want to turn on infinite shovels?
[10:31.120 --> 10:32.080]  No, I don't want...
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.860]  No, no, no, don't do infinite shovels.
[10:34.020 --> 10:35.160]  It's going to be bad.
[10:35.720 --> 10:36.080]  Yeah.
[10:37.260 --> 10:40.480]  Oh boy, that's going to be fucking crazy.
[10:40.900 --> 10:41.900]  This is going to be nuts.
[10:43.020 --> 10:44.280]  This is going to be nuts.
[10:45.040 --> 10:46.080]  Do you guys know how to play now?
[10:46.600 --> 10:46.820]  Yes.
[10:47.700 --> 10:49.440]  I just kept looking at the cause of death
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.000]  and trying to see stuff on my...
[10:51.000 --> 10:51.460]  Yeah, same.
[10:53.580 --> 10:55.580]  I also don't know when Star Wars came out.
[10:55.580 --> 10:57.580]  Uh-oh.
[11:00.140 --> 11:01.020]  Uh-oh.
[11:04.020 --> 11:05.440]  You guys saying I couldn't find a single one
[11:05.440 --> 11:07.000]  is just like, what are you talking about?
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.360]  Uh, yeah.
[11:10.420 --> 11:10.780]  No!
[11:13.100 --> 11:13.540]  What?
[11:16.540 --> 11:17.640]  Get the fuck out of here.
[11:17.820 --> 11:18.720]  No, you ain't...
[11:18.720 --> 11:19.040]  No!
[11:20.700 --> 11:21.220]  No!
[11:23.380 --> 11:23.900]  No!
[11:23.900 --> 11:25.440]  Oh, I got an achievement for that.
[11:26.300 --> 11:26.820]  Ooh.
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.280]  I was expecting it to say
[11:30.280 --> 11:32.440]  could have seen Star Wars on the tombstone.
[11:37.720 --> 11:38.240]  Motherfucker.
[11:41.530 --> 11:42.490]  I got one.
[11:50.880 --> 11:52.520]  Hit by a soapbox car.
[12:10.200 --> 12:11.780]  See you later, man.
[12:20.430 --> 12:27.370]  Ah, bitch.
[12:29.640 --> 12:30.450]  Ah, bitch.
[12:31.910 --> 12:32.950]  I'm in trouble.
[12:34.410 --> 12:35.630]  Oh, you hit me too far now.
[12:36.430 --> 12:37.130]  Oh, you're screwed.
[12:39.150 --> 12:40.930]  We hit each other.
[12:41.010 --> 12:43.150]  We hit each other so hard.
[12:44.730 --> 12:45.670]  Oh, man.
[12:48.790 --> 12:49.730]  How's everybody doing?
[12:50.050 --> 12:50.390]  Baited.
[12:50.550 --> 12:51.330]  I got three of them.
[12:51.390 --> 12:51.810]  I'm doing great.
[12:59.500 --> 13:01.140]  Did you just cross one off?
[13:01.540 --> 13:01.700]  Yep.
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.100]  How is Nick going to run away?
[13:05.560 --> 13:07.560]  Because he hasn't been fucking around with the shovels.
[13:08.360 --> 13:09.580]  What? What are you talking about?
[13:09.760 --> 13:10.760]  Alright, let's go find Nick.
[13:11.100 --> 13:11.500]  Where is he?
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.360]  Nick's about to get jumped.
[13:15.740 --> 13:17.640]  You'll never find me.
[13:18.880 --> 13:19.980]  I found him.
[13:21.820 --> 13:22.980]  What's up?
[13:22.980 --> 13:24.440]  He doesn't even have a shovel.
[13:25.220 --> 13:26.460]  I told you.
[13:27.180 --> 13:27.900]  I'm trying.
[13:28.500 --> 13:30.920]  Oh, my God.
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.480]  I just saw him fly.
[13:33.780 --> 13:34.220]  Get up.
[13:34.660 --> 13:35.180]  No.
[13:36.220 --> 13:37.860]  Oh, Geoffy.
[13:39.450 --> 13:40.820]  Don't touch me, Gavin.
[13:42.240 --> 13:43.280]  Oh, no.
[13:44.420 --> 13:45.460]  Where's Geoff?
[13:45.460 --> 13:47.500]  He's right here.
[13:47.560 --> 13:48.480]  Where's here?
[13:50.020 --> 13:51.000]  Got him.
[13:51.400 --> 13:52.820]  You've helped me. Thank you.
[13:52.840 --> 13:54.620]  No. I helped him.
[13:54.900 --> 13:56.240]  He's on the other side of the wall.
[13:59.640 --> 14:00.240]  No.
[14:01.700 --> 14:02.300]  No.
[14:02.900 --> 14:04.800]  I'm trying to win. Stop.
[14:05.140 --> 14:05.720]  I'm trying to win.
[14:06.160 --> 14:09.360]  I want to win the game.
[14:10.500 --> 14:11.280]  Groundskeeper got me.
[14:12.260 --> 14:12.680]  No.
[14:12.680 --> 14:14.120]  I'm still trying to win.
[14:15.040 --> 14:16.680]  You're affecting my ability
[14:16.680 --> 14:17.240]  to win.
[14:19.540 --> 14:20.280]  Negatively.
[14:21.300 --> 14:22.820]  This is affecting me negatively.
[14:23.800 --> 14:24.720]  I'm feeling
[14:24.720 --> 14:25.560]  very bullied.
[14:27.280 --> 14:27.840]  Oh.
[14:31.800 --> 14:32.540]  Graves.
[14:32.820 --> 14:33.160]  Baited.
[14:35.480 --> 14:36.220]  Anderson.
[14:37.860 --> 14:38.600]  Henson.
[14:39.540 --> 14:40.080]  Doyle.
[14:40.900 --> 14:42.500]  Fletcher. I need a job.
[14:42.500 --> 14:43.520]  My last name.
[14:44.700 --> 14:46.940]  I'm all in on shovels.
[14:46.940 --> 14:47.280]  Cooper.
[14:48.300 --> 14:48.680]  Morse.
[14:50.180 --> 14:50.480]  Argh.
[14:52.580 --> 14:53.960]  Oh, my God.
[14:54.340 --> 14:55.300]  I'm getting...
[14:55.300 --> 14:57.860]  He just two-ferred us.
[14:59.600 --> 15:00.220]  Oh, man.
[15:00.240 --> 15:02.000]  This shit got real, real fast.
[15:08.390 --> 15:09.150]  Collier.
[15:09.590 --> 15:11.830]  Merritt. Mann. Clark.
[15:12.650 --> 15:13.130]  Waller.
[15:13.410 --> 15:13.890]  Argh.
[15:16.710 --> 15:17.850]  He followed me.
[15:18.230 --> 15:19.790]  This motherfucker followed me.
[15:20.670 --> 15:21.690]  It's like postal 2.
[15:24.290 --> 15:25.270]  Gardner. Oh, Gardner.
[15:26.390 --> 15:27.130]  This is it. This is it.
[15:27.510 --> 15:27.970]  Yes.
[15:29.810 --> 15:32.050]  No. One more game.
[15:32.190 --> 15:33.750]  One more game right now.
[15:33.770 --> 15:34.990]  We got it. Now, here's the thing.
[15:35.370 --> 15:36.570]  We got to play Blackout.
[15:37.090 --> 15:38.070]  Let's play Blackout.
[15:38.070 --> 15:40.350]  We have to play Blackout.
[15:41.410 --> 15:43.970]  I don't know about...
[15:43.970 --> 15:46.390]  Oh, boy. Are we doing infinite shovels and Blackout?
[15:46.590 --> 15:46.870]  Yes.
[15:48.250 --> 15:49.910]  Graveyard Knight? Awesome.
[15:51.170 --> 15:52.670]  Oh, it's so dark.
[15:56.610 --> 15:58.370]  There might be a ghost
[15:58.370 --> 15:59.230]  with a shovel.
[16:02.030 --> 16:04.030]  This is... What a cool game.
[16:04.430 --> 16:08.050]  What a really fun game.
[16:08.550 --> 16:10.270]  This game would be perfect if they just...
[16:10.270 --> 16:10.490]  Argh.
[16:10.730 --> 16:13.830]  What a cool game.
[16:14.050 --> 16:15.270]  He's on me.
[16:17.310 --> 16:17.670]  No.
[16:18.590 --> 16:18.950]  No.
[16:20.870 --> 16:22.650]  I was on a jump, too.
[16:22.870 --> 16:23.510]  Oh, my God.
[16:23.990 --> 16:24.930]  Andrew, did you get one off the...
[16:24.930 --> 16:26.230]  What was that?
[16:31.030 --> 16:32.610]  I heard you swing, but I got it.
[16:32.710 --> 16:33.970]  I got it before you could get me.
[16:34.790 --> 16:35.150]  No.
[16:37.310 --> 16:38.330]  You know what? I got it, too.
[16:39.190 --> 16:39.810]  That's fine.
[16:40.110 --> 16:40.930]  Get me away from there.
[16:44.810 --> 16:46.530]  I just need to concentrate
[16:46.530 --> 16:47.350]  on my sheet.
[16:48.070 --> 16:49.410]  We all have to.
[16:50.790 --> 16:52.390]  Fell, fell, fell, fell.
[16:52.710 --> 16:53.590]  Fell, fell, fell, fell.
[16:55.530 --> 16:57.170]  Choked on a pencil.
[17:00.410 --> 17:01.210]  It's pretty good.
[17:01.690 --> 17:02.710]  Time machine.
[17:03.690 --> 17:05.410]  You could argue that that was a friend.
[17:06.310 --> 17:07.110]  You could...
[17:07.110 --> 17:08.570]  Okay, go ahead and argue with the game.
[17:10.010 --> 17:11.650]  You piece of shit, Nick.
[17:11.830 --> 17:13.070]  Just leave me alone.
[17:13.770 --> 17:14.850]  Well, you came near me.
[17:15.070 --> 17:15.830]  I was threatened.
[17:17.130 --> 17:18.350]  I don't even have a shovel.
[17:19.370 --> 17:20.750]  I was like a curled up snake.
[17:21.010 --> 17:23.310]  It just sounds like there's a clock going off constantly.
[17:24.370 --> 17:24.770]  Bong.
[17:32.780 --> 17:33.900]  Last name is a job
[17:33.900 --> 17:34.620]  is such a good one.
[17:35.300 --> 17:36.780]  It's great. That's how I won last time.
[17:36.780 --> 17:37.980]  Oh.
[17:38.760 --> 17:40.320]  Just running from grave to grave.
[17:40.820 --> 17:41.160]  Reading.
[17:42.340 --> 17:44.960]  Every day, probably.
[17:49.520 --> 17:55.100]  Oh, that's bullshit.
[17:55.700 --> 17:56.740]  That is absolute
[17:56.740 --> 17:57.240]  bullshit.
[17:58.120 --> 18:00.300]  I got told no
[18:00.300 --> 18:02.540]  for hit by an Olympic javelin
[18:02.540 --> 18:04.040]  for death by sports equipment.
[18:04.860 --> 18:06.100]  Ooh, that's tough.
[18:06.160 --> 18:07.980]  Oh, that's equipment.
[18:10.760 --> 18:12.500]  Death by network executives.
[18:15.120 --> 18:16.240]  Oh, can that be animals?
[18:16.420 --> 18:17.080]  That's rooster teeth.
[18:17.620 --> 18:19.740]  Oh, guys.
[18:19.920 --> 18:22.300]  That doesn't count by death by animal.
[18:23.140 --> 18:27.410]  Sorry, Geoff.
[18:27.510 --> 18:29.030]  You were about to get hit by the groundskeeper.
[18:29.290 --> 18:30.310]  Oh, I appreciate it, man.
[18:36.120 --> 18:36.540]  Oops.
[18:39.540 --> 18:41.340]  I know Andrew is locked in
[18:41.340 --> 18:42.880]  because he's not saying shit.
[18:42.900 --> 18:44.880]  I'm just looking. I'm reading.
[18:45.180 --> 18:46.860]  Yeah, yeah, he's still locked in.
[18:47.180 --> 18:48.920]  Oh, fuck. The microwave mafia?
[18:49.880 --> 18:50.780]  Oh, boy.
[18:51.520 --> 18:52.120]  Okay.
[18:53.760 --> 18:54.020]  Shit.
[18:55.160 --> 18:56.460]  Oh, there's a map.
[18:58.000 --> 18:58.800]  Is there?
[18:59.560 --> 19:00.040]  No.
[19:00.520 --> 19:01.180]  What button is that?
[19:01.720 --> 19:02.320]  Escape.
[19:04.460 --> 19:05.980]  What button is that on the controller?
[19:06.920 --> 19:08.280]  You're playing on a controller.
[19:08.800 --> 19:09.540]  Are you not?
[19:10.140 --> 19:10.460]  No.
[19:10.660 --> 19:11.580]  That's crazy.
[19:17.410 --> 19:18.530]  Maybe back?
[19:20.250 --> 19:22.490]  Oh, it's just start.
[19:26.320 --> 19:27.760]  Oh, we can see where everyone is.
[19:27.800 --> 19:28.320]  That's cool.
[19:29.360 --> 19:30.240]  Get out of here.
[19:31.860 --> 19:34.000]  Oh, I just sent a groundskeeper to his address.
[19:34.380 --> 19:37.100]  No, I just knocked him away from me.
[19:38.300 --> 19:39.300]  Not well enough.
[19:42.880 --> 19:43.980]  Animal, animal, animal.
[19:44.220 --> 19:47.220]  Are we going for blackout in this one?
[19:47.360 --> 19:48.020]  Yeah, it's blackout.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.440]  Goddamn you.
[19:57.880 --> 19:59.040]  Alright, is this a crime?
[20:01.820 --> 20:02.700]  Shootout is not a crime.
[20:03.640 --> 20:04.380]  I love, dude.
[20:05.460 --> 20:07.160]  Their last words, this sucks,
[20:07.340 --> 20:08.320]  is fucking awesome.
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.440]  This game is so cool. This is really fun.
[20:11.400 --> 20:11.940]  Don't!
[20:13.440 --> 20:14.700]  They're really deep on the lore here.
[20:14.900 --> 20:16.580]  Big time lore game.
[20:17.520 --> 20:18.960]  Disconnected from server.
[20:19.360 --> 20:19.940]  Oh no!
[20:21.500 --> 20:22.580]  You lose.
[20:22.780 --> 20:24.540]  That's so sad that you lost.
[20:30.960 --> 20:33.000]  Do you think you can rejoin?
[20:33.740 --> 20:34.320]  I'm going to try.
[20:36.180 --> 20:37.320]  When was sliced bread again?
[20:38.100 --> 20:38.600]  Ah!
[20:42.120 --> 20:44.000]  I was drawing a circle
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  as I was going through the air.
[20:47.540 --> 20:48.220]  Did it work?
[20:48.340 --> 20:49.100]  Did you actually get it?
[20:49.320 --> 20:50.420]  You twat!
[20:56.130 --> 20:56.570]  Uh oh.
[20:57.010 --> 20:57.930]  Oh no, I'm reading!
[21:01.990 --> 21:03.630]  Oh no, I'm reading.
[21:12.810 --> 21:15.310]  We need multiple things on gravestones, by the way.
[21:15.890 --> 21:17.930]  I thought it was one per.
[21:18.330 --> 21:19.070]  That's what I thought too.
[21:19.510 --> 21:20.810]  On blackout it's multiple.
[21:21.430 --> 21:22.930]  It told me one per.
[21:23.710 --> 21:24.790]  On blackout it did?
[21:24.850 --> 21:26.370]  No, it must have been on the last one.
[21:26.590 --> 21:27.770]  So I haven't been trying to do it.
[21:32.570 --> 21:34.090]  Can you not rejoin, Geoff?
[21:34.710 --> 21:36.270]  No, my game just keeps crashing.
[21:36.950 --> 21:37.430]  Oh really?
[21:38.870 --> 21:40.690]  You've followed me for so long!
[21:43.470 --> 21:44.870]  Slipped on salad cream.
[21:46.870 --> 21:47.790]  That's an animal.
[21:55.300 --> 21:56.420]  Oh, there's graves over here.
[21:56.420 --> 21:58.000]  Man, this game is fun when you read properly.
[22:02.060 --> 22:04.540]  I mean, where are you sending me?
[22:05.220 --> 22:06.300]  Where are you sending me?
[22:06.900 --> 22:08.060]  We're not going anywhere in here.
[22:10.480 --> 22:11.880]  I'm over here now.
[22:13.580 --> 22:17.140]  Man, these are really good.
[22:20.880 --> 22:22.580]  Oh, oh, oh.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.060]  I saw perished as well.
[22:25.240 --> 22:25.800]  Shit, fuck.
[22:26.860 --> 22:27.700]  I suck.
[22:28.560 --> 22:29.360]  Where was the perished?
[22:30.880 --> 22:32.260]  Clayton Q Humphrey.
[22:32.740 --> 22:34.920]  Invented the extra spicy icy.
[22:35.220 --> 22:36.500]  It's worse than it sounds.
[22:39.280 --> 22:41.180]  Went swimming right after eating.
[22:43.160 --> 22:45.960]  Oh, a couple of people coming over the wall.
[22:46.360 --> 22:48.240]  Yeah, that was me and Andrew.
[22:48.320 --> 22:49.200]  I hit Andrew.
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.200]  And then I got groundskeepered.
[22:52.260 --> 22:53.900]  Oh, could this be death by a friend?
[22:54.820 --> 22:55.680]  Nah, you bitch.
[22:56.380 --> 22:58.400]  Bitten by a bunch of snakes in a pit.
[23:01.900 --> 23:03.020]  That's Geoff's worst nightmare.
[23:03.280 --> 23:04.160]  Oh, it's proctoduct doctor.
[23:06.080 --> 23:08.600]  I saw the fucking flashlight, you son of a bitch.
[23:09.500 --> 23:11.620]  I saw the light behind the tombstone.
[23:14.300 --> 23:16.100]  I don't trust the timing.
[23:16.680 --> 23:16.880]  Nope.
[23:16.880 --> 23:17.580]  Ah!
[23:20.200 --> 23:21.540]  Didn't I have a dove?
[23:22.900 --> 23:24.800]  Oh, there it is.
[23:27.080 --> 23:27.800]  Don't touch me!
[23:28.880 --> 23:29.280]  Ah!
[23:32.340 --> 23:33.660]  You gave me just enough time.
[23:33.920 --> 23:35.220]  I know, I heard you squiggle.
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.260]  Ah, you bitch!
[23:44.920 --> 23:46.740]  We both got groundskeepered.
[23:47.280 --> 23:48.440]  Okay, I thought it was you.
[23:52.780 --> 23:54.640]  I got a perished, thank God.
[23:55.940 --> 23:56.600]  Oh, candles!
[23:56.680 --> 23:57.840]  I haven't been looking for candles.
[23:58.460 --> 24:00.280]  Well, at least candles are really easy to find.
[24:01.180 --> 24:01.340]  Yeah.
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.400]  You know what, that's a fair point.
[24:09.160 --> 24:11.240]  Oh, you freaking were ready for that one.
[24:11.760 --> 24:13.820]  I saw your flashlight approaching.
[24:14.900 --> 24:15.300]  Ah!
[24:15.300 --> 24:18.900]  Did we do it to each other?
[24:19.240 --> 24:19.460]  Yep.
[24:19.900 --> 24:26.150]  I like that someone could stumble on this game
[24:26.150 --> 24:28.250]  and would have no idea of all the references
[24:28.250 --> 24:29.950]  and it's still a totally functioning game.
[24:30.050 --> 24:31.290]  Yeah, it totally makes sense.
[24:33.790 --> 24:35.490]  Are you stuck in a bench?
[24:35.710 --> 24:36.190]  I am.
[24:40.470 --> 24:45.390]  There, I got you.
[24:45.390 --> 24:46.630]  Thanks, buddy.
[24:46.750 --> 24:49.070]  Alright, I'm back.
[24:49.170 --> 24:51.490]  I can join whenever you guys are done.
[24:51.510 --> 24:52.390]  Do it.
[24:52.510 --> 24:53.450]  Oh, it crashed the game.
[24:57.350 --> 24:58.430]  Oh, wow!
[25:18.060 --> 25:19.140]  Standing desks.
[25:19.660 --> 25:20.760]  I remember when we did that.
[25:20.760 --> 25:22.520]  I think I just have to wait
[25:22.520 --> 25:23.140]  until y'all are done.
[25:23.820 --> 25:26.080]  That sucks.
[25:26.560 --> 25:27.760]  Nah, it's okay.
[25:29.260 --> 25:29.740]  Truce?
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.760]  Truce, I'm going to read there, you read there.
[25:33.180 --> 25:33.240]  Ha!
[25:36.420 --> 25:38.320]  Sadly died of ligma.
[25:42.000 --> 25:42.800]  That's great.
[25:44.940 --> 25:46.480]  Oh no, an inventing accident.
[25:46.680 --> 25:48.160]  Fuck, that's forever ago.
[25:52.760 --> 25:53.870]  Oh, oh, oh.
[25:55.300 --> 25:56.960]  No, no, no, get away, no!
[25:57.400 --> 25:57.560]  No!
[26:00.540 --> 26:02.780]  I was about to shout I avenged you, but I missed.
[26:04.840 --> 26:06.380]  Get over the wall, oh shit!
[26:08.640 --> 26:10.080]  He sent me flying.
[26:13.300 --> 26:13.720]  Oh.
[26:14.500 --> 26:16.080]  I can't believe there are so many.
[26:19.020 --> 26:20.600]  There are so many graves.
[26:25.050 --> 26:25.570]  Shit.
[26:25.890 --> 26:27.850]  I could hear that and I got panicked.
[26:28.170 --> 26:29.010]  I could hear the swinging.
[26:29.190 --> 26:31.070]  I popped out of my grave to swing around.
[26:32.210 --> 26:32.730]  Ow!
[26:38.460 --> 26:39.800]  Bought the system.
[26:41.040 --> 26:41.480]  Oh!
[26:44.900 --> 26:46.880]  Oh no, alliteration!
[26:47.040 --> 26:47.560]  Ah, balls.
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.580]  Have I seen a sir yet?
[26:52.580 --> 26:57.710]  Yeah, balls.
[26:58.410 --> 26:59.510]  Oh, isn't dead.
[27:00.090 --> 27:01.650]  Shot dead in the matrix.
[27:03.870 --> 27:05.430]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[27:06.550 --> 27:06.670]  Uh.
[27:07.590 --> 27:08.430]  That's not what this is.
[27:13.980 --> 27:15.300]  How we doing with the cards?
[27:16.040 --> 27:18.680]  So, I'm just, I'm getting there, but man, it's a lot.
[27:19.580 --> 27:20.220]  It's a lot.
[27:20.540 --> 27:23.120]  Lost a fight against security falcons.
[27:30.690 --> 27:32.690]  Oh god, oh, the groundskeeper!
[27:33.410 --> 27:34.890]  Oh, that son of a...
[27:43.180 --> 27:45.200]  A lot of people are dying due to salad cream.
[27:46.080 --> 27:46.420]  Yeah.
[27:47.020 --> 27:47.480]  Oh ha!
[27:50.200 --> 27:50.640]  Oh!
[27:52.780 --> 27:54.580]  He hit me while I was down!
[27:58.240 --> 27:59.320]  Oh god, this...
[27:59.320 --> 27:59.780]  Oh no.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.520]  Yeah, good luck getting back in here.
[28:05.560 --> 28:06.620]  We hit each other.
[28:06.620 --> 28:07.460]  That was perfect.
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.020]  Sasha X Little Dog Thornton.
[28:15.320 --> 28:18.120]  I found that one and then I realized I had a nickname.
[28:23.820 --> 28:24.540]  Shit!
[28:27.620 --> 28:29.680]  You launched me onto a bench.
[28:32.940 --> 28:33.200]  Ah!
[28:33.200 --> 28:33.440]  Ah!
[28:37.500 --> 28:37.900]  Ah!
[28:37.900 --> 28:39.080]  No, I was clear!
[28:47.300 --> 28:49.320]  Ah, you rat fuck.
[28:51.040 --> 28:52.240]  Ah! Look out, Eric!
[28:52.520 --> 28:52.920]  Groundskeeper.
[28:54.720 --> 28:55.540]  I got him, Nick.
[28:56.140 --> 28:56.880]  Nice job.
[28:57.620 --> 28:59.020]  I want to read this, don't touch me.
[29:02.960 --> 29:03.760]  Uh oh.
[29:04.400 --> 29:04.780]  Ah!
[29:04.900 --> 29:13.490]  Oh, I did just see a doctor.
[29:13.490 --> 29:14.470]  Man, I'm dumb.
[29:14.930 --> 29:16.550]  Holy shit, it's hard being dumb.
[29:16.750 --> 29:17.730]  You saw a doctor?
[29:18.650 --> 29:19.130]  Yeah.
[29:19.670 --> 29:20.930]  I gotta get over to you.
[29:22.510 --> 29:24.970]  No, I'm close!
[29:27.370 --> 29:28.730]  I thought I had it!
[29:29.650 --> 29:30.230]  Kill Eric!
[29:31.850 --> 29:32.290]  Where is he?
[29:32.690 --> 29:33.550]  He was just by me.
[29:38.080 --> 29:40.180]  Is this a fight? Would the cricket bat be a fight?
[29:40.960 --> 29:41.880]  Oh no, liquid!
[29:44.620 --> 29:44.980]  Shit.
[29:46.300 --> 29:46.660]  You...
[29:48.600 --> 29:48.960]  Fuck.
[29:49.580 --> 29:49.940]  Fuck!
[29:52.100 --> 29:53.160]  Would that be a fight?
[29:53.960 --> 29:54.680]  Just click it.
[29:54.800 --> 29:55.280]  Just try.
[29:57.260 --> 29:57.980]  I did.
[29:58.960 --> 29:59.840]  What do you want from me?
[29:59.860 --> 30:00.940]  Then why are you still pondering?
[30:02.820 --> 30:05.700]  I pondered first when I remembered it and ran back to it.
[30:05.820 --> 30:07.280]  And then I pondered again as I clicked it.
[30:07.280 --> 30:07.320]  I see, I see.
[30:08.060 --> 30:09.000]  That's right, that's fair.
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.480]  I'm sorry.
[30:10.600 --> 30:11.420]  No, from my perspective.
[30:11.800 --> 30:13.340]  I thought you were just staring at it.
[30:13.540 --> 30:14.880]  Is it? Is it not?
[30:16.560 --> 30:18.140]  You have the whole company on a Friday afternoon.
[30:25.490 --> 30:27.430]  I need more graves.
[30:30.050 --> 30:31.010]  More graves.
[30:31.250 --> 30:31.610]  No!
[30:32.170 --> 30:34.690]  No more graves. Daddy wins.
[30:35.150 --> 30:35.490]  Shit.
[30:36.830 --> 30:38.610]  Yes! Blackout baby, look at that.
[30:38.650 --> 30:39.910]  They put me in the game and everything.
[30:41.450 --> 30:41.930]  Crazy.
[30:42.970 --> 30:44.290]  White guy with a mustache, baby.
[30:45.810 --> 30:47.990]  Look at that. You guys weren't even close.
[30:48.570 --> 30:49.270]  Shut up.
[30:49.670 --> 30:51.030]  You guys weren't even fucking close.
[30:51.570 --> 30:53.630]  Let's get Geoff back in here.
[30:53.750 --> 30:54.610]  God damn it.
[30:54.990 --> 30:57.430]  I just spit water all over myself.
[30:58.010 --> 30:59.090]  Let me know when there's a lobby.
[30:59.630 --> 31:01.650]  Yeah, you can join on Gavin.
[31:02.110 --> 31:03.150]  Let me try.
[31:03.890 --> 31:06.450]  Do you want to go out on a shovel fight?
[31:06.830 --> 31:07.150]  Yes.
[31:08.190 --> 31:09.530]  Let's do it.
[31:10.930 --> 31:12.770]  Gavin, you made me laugh so hard.
[31:12.870 --> 31:14.050]  I spit out water everywhere.
[31:16.470 --> 31:19.570]  I like that the shoveling is just as fun as the actual bingo.
[31:20.010 --> 31:23.310]  It is so fun.
[31:23.530 --> 31:24.630]  This is so fun.
[31:25.450 --> 31:26.030]  Whoa!
[31:29.010 --> 31:30.910]  We're still playing bingo?
[31:31.830 --> 31:32.030]  What?
[31:32.030 --> 31:32.690]  What?
[31:33.950 --> 31:35.170]  Oh my god.
[31:35.930 --> 31:36.930]  This is insane.
[31:39.770 --> 31:41.330]  Where are the shovels?
[31:42.090 --> 31:43.070]  We don't get them.
[31:43.930 --> 31:45.210]  Wait, what are we supposed to do?
[31:45.450 --> 31:46.490]  Last name is a job.
[31:47.470 --> 31:48.950]  We have to look for...
[31:48.950 --> 31:51.150]  They just pop up?
[31:52.450 --> 31:53.630]  Nice, way to go, Gavin.
[31:53.790 --> 31:54.170]  No!
[31:54.970 --> 31:57.390]  You just happened to walk up to the one.
[31:57.690 --> 31:58.550]  How did you get that?
[32:02.030 --> 32:02.430]  Oh shit!
[32:02.930 --> 32:03.490]  Kick the bucket.
[32:05.370 --> 32:05.870]  Ow!
[32:08.290 --> 32:10.370]  Where the god damn is it?
[32:12.330 --> 32:12.890]  Yes!
[32:13.210 --> 32:13.590]  No!
[32:14.190 --> 32:15.670]  You lucky son of a bitch!
[32:16.610 --> 32:17.050]  No!
[32:19.530 --> 32:21.790]  Born before sliced bread.
[32:21.890 --> 32:22.770]  Just really old.
[32:23.990 --> 32:24.550]  Ah!
[32:25.730 --> 32:26.110]  Ow!
[32:26.410 --> 32:28.970]  You son of a bitch.
[32:29.510 --> 32:30.550]  I'm not even...
[32:30.550 --> 32:32.250]  I'm not even looking at these things.
[32:32.350 --> 32:33.270]  I'm just swinging.
[32:38.410 --> 32:39.750]  Died in the 20s.
[32:39.850 --> 32:41.950]  I lost my shovel for that.
[32:42.210 --> 32:44.710]  You bitch.
[32:45.790 --> 32:46.270]  Oh!
[32:46.410 --> 32:47.570]  It went over the side.
[32:48.390 --> 32:50.190]  Get the fuck out of here.
[32:50.450 --> 32:52.210]  It takes so long to go down.
[32:52.670 --> 32:52.850]  Shit!
[32:53.670 --> 32:53.910]  Ah!
[32:58.970 --> 32:59.530]  Got it!
[33:01.090 --> 33:02.330]  Bye bye!
[33:03.850 --> 33:04.350]  Damn it, Nick.
[33:06.250 --> 33:07.130]  Last name's a job.
[33:11.250 --> 33:11.870]  Nicholson.
[33:14.310 --> 33:14.930]  Doyle.
[33:15.070 --> 33:16.010]  Jesus Christ.
[33:16.630 --> 33:17.710]  The classic job, Doyle!
[33:18.130 --> 33:18.330]  No!
[33:19.650 --> 33:20.810]  What was the job?
[33:21.270 --> 33:21.830]  It was a mayor.
[33:22.610 --> 33:26.030]  Oh my god, lived 70 years.
[33:26.030 --> 33:27.390]  Quick shovel maths.
[33:28.590 --> 33:29.350]  Not that one.
[33:30.530 --> 33:33.590]  Every time I look at a fucking grave, I'm dead immediately.
[33:33.590 --> 33:34.010]  I read it wrong.
[33:34.050 --> 33:35.770]  Oh, you're just supposed to read it without touching it.
[33:35.810 --> 33:36.770]  Yeah, I read it wrong.
[33:36.910 --> 33:38.270]  Oh, that's what you're supposed to do?
[33:38.350 --> 33:38.750]  Got it!
[33:39.910 --> 33:41.290]  I've just been mashing them.
[33:41.790 --> 33:43.830]  No, no, you're mashing it and it knocks you around.
[33:44.590 --> 33:46.550]  Oh my god, another one lived 70 plus years?
[33:47.170 --> 33:47.510]  Jesus.
[33:50.470 --> 33:50.890]  Damn it.
[33:51.190 --> 33:52.130]  What the fuck?
[33:53.970 --> 33:54.450]  Shit.
[33:55.950 --> 33:57.010]  Oh, close there.
[33:57.970 --> 33:58.250]  Ah!
[33:58.910 --> 34:01.170]  Oh no, he hit me so high in the air.
[34:01.390 --> 34:02.970]  Oh, I'm never coming down.
[34:04.690 --> 34:05.170]  Shit.
[34:08.190 --> 34:08.670]  Yeah!
[34:09.090 --> 34:10.590]  Oh, Andrew got it.
[34:10.790 --> 34:11.710]  Oh god, Nick.
[34:11.850 --> 34:13.310]  Oh, Eric, no!
[34:15.330 --> 34:17.210]  Can you see a Star Wars in the theaters?
[34:18.170 --> 34:18.950]  Oh, it's this one.
[34:20.850 --> 34:21.650]  Not this one.
[34:21.910 --> 34:22.430]  Damn it.
[34:23.450 --> 34:23.850]  Yeah!
[34:25.550 --> 34:27.430]  Now that Andrew knows how to play the game.
[34:27.930 --> 34:29.010]  It's a whole new game.
[34:30.250 --> 34:31.010]  Killed by crime, huh?
[34:31.430 --> 34:34.250]  No kidding.
[34:35.090 --> 34:35.550]  Got it.
[34:35.750 --> 34:37.050]  Oh, come on!
[34:38.550 --> 34:39.730]  I just pressed the first one.
[34:39.750 --> 34:39.890]  By Gavin.
[34:41.390 --> 34:42.910]  Killed by a friend, that was me just now.
[34:43.070 --> 34:44.350]  That was you, right now.
[34:46.190 --> 34:46.990]  Oh no.
[34:46.990 --> 34:47.170]  Oh.
[34:54.670 --> 34:56.450]  Nick, I'm gonna remember that.
[34:56.690 --> 34:57.710]  Oh, you bastard, man.
[34:59.010 --> 35:00.610]  This mode is awesome.
[35:00.710 --> 35:01.970]  What a great idea.
[35:02.250 --> 35:03.310]  This mode is cool.
[35:03.750 --> 35:05.070]  This mode is awesome.
[35:07.350 --> 35:07.830]  Ha ha!
[35:09.110 --> 35:09.590]  Damn it.
[35:09.590 --> 35:10.070]  Damn you.
[35:11.650 --> 35:13.810]  Why couldn't you have fallen off the cliff forever?
[35:14.110 --> 35:15.350]  Oh, is it actually dead?
[35:15.790 --> 35:16.410]  Oh, hell yeah.
[35:17.770 --> 35:18.550]  Got it!
[35:18.890 --> 35:20.430]  Come on!
[35:21.410 --> 35:22.430]  No, you didn't.
[35:22.650 --> 35:24.070]  I made sure of that.
[35:25.550 --> 35:26.590]  Clothing incident.
[35:27.450 --> 35:28.770]  Ah, Nick!
[35:29.850 --> 35:31.350]  I won't let you win!
[35:31.570 --> 35:32.090]  Damn you!
[35:33.730 --> 35:35.450]  Oh, I took a big swing
[35:35.450 --> 35:37.550]  in guessing that maybe a CPAP machine
[35:37.550 --> 35:38.810]  could count his clothes.
[35:39.230 --> 35:41.010]  I was guessing a grenade counted his clothes.
[35:41.310 --> 35:42.250]  I got one that said,
[35:42.350 --> 35:43.890]  died inventing a new pocket.
[35:45.910 --> 35:47.410]  Just relax for a minute.
[35:47.450 --> 35:48.350]  Killed by a crime.
[35:48.610 --> 35:49.950]  Ah, it's not it!
[35:52.470 --> 35:53.610]  There you go.
[35:55.070 --> 35:59.270]  No, damn it!
[35:59.350 --> 36:00.670]  I just hit the button.
[36:02.030 --> 36:03.970]  Don't let Gavin look at any grenades.
[36:04.210 --> 36:05.250]  Don't let me look.
[36:05.330 --> 36:05.930]  No, Geoff!
[36:10.030 --> 36:11.370]  No, I made it to you!
[36:14.350 --> 36:15.890]  Oh, did it go away?
[36:16.090 --> 36:17.990]  Yeah, nobody got it.
[36:18.590 --> 36:20.070]  Died in their sleep.
[36:22.090 --> 36:23.750]  Got them both, baby!
[36:24.970 --> 36:25.350]  Damn it.
[36:26.090 --> 36:26.590]  I got saved.
[36:28.290 --> 36:28.530]  Yes!
[36:28.930 --> 36:29.510]  Shit.
[36:32.010 --> 36:33.650]  Went away from what?
[36:33.730 --> 36:34.430]  How do you know that?
[36:35.150 --> 36:36.670]  Oh, really?
[36:37.410 --> 36:38.730]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[36:39.770 --> 36:40.250]  Damn it.
[36:41.550 --> 36:42.590]  Struck by an object?
[36:42.590 --> 36:43.150]  No, that's bullshit!
[36:44.550 --> 36:46.350]  If you die in a shootout,
[36:46.470 --> 36:47.350]  you die from an object.
[36:48.970 --> 36:49.490]  Well,
[36:50.330 --> 36:50.850]  perished.
[36:51.430 --> 36:54.710]  Here we go.
[36:55.450 --> 36:55.790]  Oh!
[36:57.250 --> 36:58.110]  It was on me!
[36:59.210 --> 37:01.330]  I was on your tail, man.
[37:02.950 --> 37:03.910]  It's a win!
[37:04.950 --> 37:05.510]  That was great.
[37:06.130 --> 37:06.810]  Way to go, Geoff.
[37:06.810 --> 37:08.470]  Oh, dude, I was just hitting people.
[37:08.710 --> 37:09.350]  I was having fun.
[37:11.450 --> 37:12.770]  This game is awesome.
[37:12.930 --> 37:14.290]  Tombstone Tally is fucking cool.
[37:14.530 --> 37:16.930]  It's free on Steam.
[37:17.270 --> 37:18.590]  This is not an ad.
[37:18.830 --> 37:20.070]  This game is awesome.
[37:21.210 --> 37:21.610]  Incredible.
[37:22.090 --> 37:23.130]  This is fun.
[37:24.350 --> 37:25.350]  Yeah, we should definitely play it again.
[37:26.430 --> 37:28.170]  Do you know how many people it supports?
[37:28.290 --> 37:29.110]  I could never find an answer.
[37:30.710 --> 37:32.790]  I feel like it's set up to six.
[37:33.430 --> 37:34.370]  I think at least six.
[37:34.370 --> 37:34.610]  Yeah.
[37:35.790 --> 37:38.430]  Wow, what a fun game.
[37:39.110 --> 37:40.730]  Thanks for watching us play Tombstone Tally.
[37:40.790 --> 37:41.550]  Go download it.
[37:42.510 --> 37:43.270]  Play it yourself.
[37:43.870 --> 37:45.090]  You could get 12 people.
[37:46.170 --> 37:46.570]  Really?
[37:47.110 --> 37:49.470]  I would do this with Falcons.
[37:50.070 --> 37:52.210]  Yeah, I would do this with Falcons for sure.
[37:52.710 --> 37:54.350]  And if you want to become a Falcon, you can.
