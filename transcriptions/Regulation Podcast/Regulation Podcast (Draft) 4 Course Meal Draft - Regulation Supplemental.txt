[00:00.000 --> 00:06.700]  Hello and welcome to another piece of regulation content. This one's a supplemental. It is a draft.
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.820]  It is a food-based draft. Today we are doing the four-course meal draft. I believe Gavin gave us
[00:13.820 --> 00:18.840]  this idea in Vegas and we all jumped at the chance to do it, so we're very excited. Gavin,
[00:19.540 --> 00:23.720]  what were you thinking when you came up with this idea? What was the genesis behind this idea?
[00:24.160 --> 00:28.560]  Well, considering I didn't really understand this idea, which was not my idea,
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.800]  I don't think I'm in any position to explain it. Magnanimous and humble at all times. Thank you so
[00:35.800 --> 00:39.820]  much for a career, Gavin. I thank you. Yeah, I really appreciate it. Yet again, cannot thank
[00:39.820 --> 00:45.540]  you enough. What do you guys think we should randomize this one for? Four? It's a four-course
[00:45.540 --> 00:49.900]  meal? Four times? Yeah, either four or... Yeah, I want to hear from Andrew because I knew it wasn't
[00:49.900 --> 00:58.340]  going to be as simple as that. Go ahead. It's either four or 16. Either or. And why 16? Why
[00:59.040 --> 01:05.780]  would that be? Four for each of us. I was thinking four by four. I definitely could
[01:05.780 --> 01:10.200]  follow exactly where your head went. I went, that's not right. That's not right at all. No,
[01:10.260 --> 01:13.580]  I went, there's four of you and there's a four-course meal, 16. And then I went,
[01:13.640 --> 01:18.800]  I'm part of this as well. Nevermind, 20. Unfortunately, you are part of this.
[01:19.300 --> 01:25.000]  Every draft is 20. Thoughts? I have none.
[01:34.330 --> 01:39.430]  I'm looking at my menu. I have time for this. Oh my god. Okay, so what are we doing? We draft
[01:39.430 --> 01:43.650]  four? Is it four? Let's do four. Yeah, we're doing four. All right. Well, as always,
[01:43.730 --> 01:47.390]  we're using Sean Bear's site. Thank you very much, Sean Bear. This makes it so easy for us
[01:47.390 --> 01:51.710]  and we can randomize as many times as we want. It starts in an egg order and now we will randomize
[01:51.710 --> 02:01.270]  four times. One, two, three, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Geoff, Nick, but the fourth and final randomization
[02:02.330 --> 02:12.430]  boom, Geoff, Gavin, Eric, Nick, Andrew. Geoff back-to-back ones. Yes, boys, you have no idea
[02:12.430 --> 02:18.430]  how exciting this is. As me and Geoff were here today, I said, Geoff, how are you feeling about
[02:18.430 --> 02:22.510]  these drafts? And he said, you know what, Emily didn't love my one-hit wonders picks, but that's
[02:22.510 --> 02:26.330]  okay. I really feel good about them. And I said, that's great. How about the four-course meal draft?
[02:26.390 --> 02:31.530]  How are you feeling about that? He said, well, I'm not sure. I guess I'll do it based on what
[02:31.530 --> 02:38.310]  you guys draft. And then I said, Geoff, what if you go first? And Geoff said, don't worry. I never
[02:38.310 --> 02:46.570]  go first. And now we begin the four-course meal draft with Geoff Ramsey. Okay, for my first pick,
[02:46.810 --> 02:50.150]  obviously in a four-course meal, you want to start with the appetizer,
[02:51.690 --> 02:57.610]  which is where I'm going to take us. When I sit down to eat a four-course meal, the first thing
[02:57.610 --> 03:03.010]  I want to have is a little bit of bread, but maybe some tang too. So I'm going to go with the
[03:03.470 --> 03:07.910]  item that I have been planning on for weeks in this draft, because clearly I came in prepared,
[03:09.490 --> 03:15.890]  bruschetta. A little bit of bruschetta, a little tomato, a little drizzle. Did you say tang? What
[03:15.890 --> 03:21.290]  is it about the bruschetta that you're feeling particular about? Oh, I love the cheese mixed
[03:21.290 --> 03:27.510]  with the warm crust of the bread with the little cut up, diced up tomatoes on top. Sometimes there's
[03:27.510 --> 03:32.690]  some parsley as well, which is delicious. And then like a little like olive and vinegar
[03:33.650 --> 03:36.930]  spread over the top. It's just it's tangy. It's delicious. It's crunchy.
[03:37.890 --> 03:41.790]  It warms your little tummy. And you've been planning on that for weeks now. Oh my god,
[03:41.830 --> 03:45.430]  since Gavin gave us the idea, I think I immediately went down and started writing.
[03:49.970 --> 03:53.930]  Fuck. Also, not cool to be on the end when you don't have anything planned. Yeah,
[03:53.930 --> 04:01.290]  we get two in a row. Yeah, this is pretty good. Gavin, you have the second pick as Geoff has set
[04:01.290 --> 04:07.990]  the tempo. You now can do anything you want based on what Geoff has done. Well, bread is amazing. I
[04:07.990 --> 04:11.750]  just didn't consider that it might be a course because I feel like you can keep bread going
[04:11.750 --> 04:18.610]  through multiple courses, more of a side thing for me. So I want to sit down and stuff my fat
[04:18.610 --> 04:26.490]  face with a lovely prawn cocktail. And I want it to be in that format, hanging over the thing,
[04:27.030 --> 04:32.250]  bit of that red, spicy-ish sauce. And I don't want the tiny little shrimpy ones. I want just
[04:32.250 --> 04:38.610]  fat old prawns. Yeah, big one. Big ol'. Nick said cocktail sauce and then you didn't say anything.
[04:38.890 --> 04:44.070]  Oh, sorry. Yeah, yeah. You were both talking at the same time. Oh, nope. I don't think so.
[04:45.650 --> 04:48.030]  I'm with Gavin. That's how it came across for us.
[04:49.030 --> 04:53.350]  Dude, this internet maybe sucks. No, I think you just should shut up a little bit and then...
[04:54.490 --> 05:00.730]  Nobody was talking and then Nick talked. You were talking. Definitely wasn't. Cocktail sauce.
[05:01.010 --> 05:04.450]  You know what? Hey, cocktail sauce. Yes, cocktail sauce. It was my condiment.
[05:05.410 --> 05:09.370]  It was. Excellent. I was just thinking about that. Yeah. It'd be disgusting to
[05:09.890 --> 05:15.830]  spill your prawn cocktail over the bruschetta. Just ruin it for everybody. Nobody wants that.
[05:17.230 --> 05:24.650]  I'm liking these pics so far. All right. Well, we go to mine next. And I had a lot of choices. I
[05:24.650 --> 05:31.490]  think appetizer is really important in everything. But it's all about what you want in your own
[05:31.490 --> 05:40.930]  four course meal. And for me, that's Coors Banquet. Crack a couple of yellow cans. Fill up a little
[05:40.930 --> 05:50.050]  bit before you really get started. Beautiful. From the streams of golden Colorado comes Coors
[05:50.050 --> 05:55.750]  Banquet. The beer that my neighbor Larry growing up would drink tons of and just throw in his
[05:55.750 --> 06:03.050]  backyard. Just Gavin style. Finish it. Boom. Throw it in the backyard. That's where it goes. See the
[06:03.050 --> 06:09.590]  cans pile up. But that is my that's my appetizer. You come over, check it out. Boom. Coors Banquet.
[06:10.130 --> 06:15.390]  I'm really liking these. I'm visualizing walking into a restaurant and this being what I'm
[06:15.390 --> 06:21.110]  greeted with so far. Yeah, it's a good it's a good meal for me. Nick, Coors Banquet's my pick.
[06:21.290 --> 06:25.410]  I'm sorry if that stepped on yours, but go ahead. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pivot. No, this is
[06:25.410 --> 06:31.250]  actually I came into this with just one thing in mind. So if this got taken, I was totally screwed.
[06:31.250 --> 06:37.170]  Nick told me he has no backups. If someone picks by accident something that he picked,
[06:37.430 --> 06:42.770]  he's fucked. He's fucked. Royally and utterly fucked. But we've we've talked about it, right?
[06:42.850 --> 06:46.270]  It's the it's the opening course. It's the appetizer, the hors d'oeuvre, if you will.
[06:46.470 --> 06:49.910]  There's not quite an hors d'oeuvre like this one. I'm going with a Bloomin' Onion.
[06:50.730 --> 06:57.470]  The Bloomin' Onion. That's a good one. That's a really good one. That's a really good one.
[06:57.470 --> 07:02.910]  This is, uh, calorically an insane meal. I don't think I'd want to eat anything else after that.
[07:03.490 --> 07:06.990]  No, that would be it. Share it, Gavin. Share it. You don't eat the whole thing yourself.
[07:07.210 --> 07:12.170]  It's for the table. Why did Emily and Meg and I go get a Bloomin' Onion together without you
[07:12.170 --> 07:16.310]  recently? What was the deal there? What? What? Where were we? Oh, maybe because I don't want to
[07:16.310 --> 07:22.070]  eat that. I don't know. I thought I would have gone just to hang out. Oh, is that why? I mean,
[07:22.130 --> 07:25.430]  it's fine. It's like you have one or two little nibs and it's like, okay, I'm done with it.
[07:25.970 --> 07:28.870]  Can I speculate that maybe it was during a La Boo Boo hunt?
[07:29.810 --> 07:33.750]  It was not. It was before the La Boo Boo's. But if it was during a La Boo Boo hunt,
[07:33.810 --> 07:37.290]  Gavin would have been there because he was at the last La Boo Boo hunt hanging out with all of us.
[07:37.350 --> 07:38.530]  I sat on a little camping chair.
[07:40.610 --> 07:46.530]  Pretty impressive. Uh, Bloomin' Onion, good pick right there. Thank you. But now we go over to
[07:46.530 --> 07:51.730]  Andrew. I'm excited. Who will have his first course, but he'll also have his second course.
[07:51.730 --> 07:57.430]  Andrew, what are you going with? First and second, serving it up for the people. This is going to
[07:57.430 --> 08:01.690]  look like this is my one and two going into this, but this is going to feel like I'm really taking
[08:01.690 --> 08:08.130]  some Nick energy here. I'm going to open once again with another thing in the bread family.
[08:08.570 --> 08:14.730]  It's my favorite bread type thing to receive when going to a place. I want a nice focaccia
[08:15.410 --> 08:21.170]  with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. You can dip it, you mix it around. It's the saltiness.
[08:22.170 --> 08:28.970]  It's delicious. So that is what I'm opening with for my first dish. And that that's another bread
[08:28.970 --> 08:33.130]  course. That's another bread course. Gavin, how do you feel about that? I mean, once again,
[08:33.170 --> 08:40.150]  delicious. I just don't think I would order that for some sort of envisioning my thing being from
[08:40.150 --> 08:45.230]  the moment you sit down till you leave. So you're immediately you're hit with the bread. Also, I've
[08:45.230 --> 08:51.790]  never seen a bruschetta, my thing, as a side. It's always an appetizer. Agreed. That's true.
[08:52.170 --> 08:57.410]  Yeah. Yeah. That's never like just on the table as you sit down. No, that could still be an
[08:57.410 --> 09:02.770]  hors d'oeuvre. Could. But now we're moving to my appetizer. I mean, I'm building I'm building a
[09:02.770 --> 09:08.890]  little bit of a theme. And for my happy, this is you've looked at the menu now you're evaluating.
[09:09.670 --> 09:17.130]  I love open it up. Everyone can share plate of bacon barbecue wrapped prawns.
[09:17.670 --> 09:23.510]  Delicious. So good. Double prawns. That crunch. You get the prawn, a delicious prawn,
[09:23.570 --> 09:29.350]  some barbecue sauce on there. You get the tang. It's delicious. Now, do they say prawn in Canada
[09:29.350 --> 09:35.510]  or do they say shrimp? Uh, you hear both. OK. I don't think there's a wrong answer, but prawn
[09:35.510 --> 09:40.870]  is shrimp. We're about to have a lot of fun on this show, folks. Nick, what did you think a prawn
[09:40.870 --> 09:47.550]  was? It's like a big shrimp, right? Yeah. I think that's the exact same creature. I feel like in
[09:47.550 --> 09:51.290]  England, I always heard shrimp when it was like the tiny ones and you get like, yes, 40 of them.
[09:51.550 --> 09:55.830]  And then a prawn would be like you're dealing with them individually. America's fucking up.
[09:56.690 --> 10:03.250]  What did you think? What did you think it was? Seafood. Right. But it's what? That's right.
[10:04.110 --> 10:11.870]  Wait, no, that's a type. Damn it. Hold on. Think about it. What is a prawn to you? Seafood words?
[10:13.170 --> 10:20.950]  What's the animal though? Seabug? Yes. I mean, I agree with that. Yeah, it is a seabug.
[10:21.310 --> 10:24.610]  You wouldn't look down into the sea and be like, oh, it's the school of scampi.
[10:26.690 --> 10:30.410]  Look at the scampi scamper. Look at all that dinner down there.
[10:32.070 --> 10:37.370]  Oh, wow. To me, it's like when you see a shrimp, that's a Peter Dinklage. But when you see a prawn,
[10:37.450 --> 10:44.570]  that's a The Rock. It's just your version of the same thing. Nick is saying, OK, and like,
[10:44.630 --> 10:49.010]  we're like, we're painting this picture for him now. I'm not asking about now. I'm asking about
[10:49.470 --> 10:56.990]  before. Like, what was what's the what's the thing that's round that they make that seafood?
[10:56.990 --> 11:02.430]  Um, scallops? Yeah, yeah. I was like, maybe it's a scallop. See, I can't fuck with those.
[11:02.510 --> 11:08.370]  I'm allergic to scallops, but I love prawns. OK, how is a prawn or shrimp? What did you think?
[11:08.430 --> 11:12.990]  Yeah. What did you think a scallop was in your head? The shrimp was the scallop or the prawn
[11:12.990 --> 11:17.410]  was a scallop? The prawn. You thought the prawn was a scallop? Oh, I thought maybe it was like
[11:17.410 --> 11:23.710]  it. I don't know. Have you heard of King Prawn? No. What's that? It's a big ass shrimp, dude.
[11:23.710 --> 11:26.790]  The biggest shrimp you've ever seen in your life. Why the fuck don't we call it prawns here?
[11:27.170 --> 11:30.150]  I had some in Australia once and it was too much for me. I couldn't take it.
[11:30.490 --> 11:33.850]  We could have gulf prawns. We call them gulf shrimp, but they're huge.
[11:34.350 --> 11:39.030]  Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. I think it's just I just I think that Andrew's assessment is correct that
[11:39.030 --> 11:42.670]  a prawn is like a large version of a shrimp. I just in America, I feel like we just refer
[11:42.670 --> 11:46.710]  to everything as shrimp. Maybe it's like a different class of the same species or something.
[11:47.050 --> 11:51.190]  OK, I don't even think it's a class thing. I think I think it's like what you guys are saying is
[11:51.190 --> 11:57.390]  right. The smallest shrimp, the biggest prawn. But Nick didn't know that. But he also didn't know
[11:57.390 --> 12:03.250]  what it was to begin with. Can I be vulnerable for a minute and reveal a irrational fear?
[12:03.810 --> 12:08.550]  Whenever I give out a food allergy I have, I get nervous internally because I feel like I'm
[12:08.550 --> 12:14.370]  setting somebody up for a silent assassin and hit man. I'm just teeing him up. I'm giving him my
[12:14.370 --> 12:24.770]  weaknesses. How many food allergies do you have? Three or four. You got milk? Milk, corn, salmon
[12:24.770 --> 12:30.310]  and scallops. Whoa, two sea things? You're allergic to all the same shit my dog is.
[12:31.510 --> 12:35.170]  Me and Albert. I can come over and give you shots every 10 days.
[12:36.710 --> 12:41.910]  Well, those are my picks. I'm happy with my board so far. Well, there you go. Well, Nick,
[12:41.910 --> 12:46.730]  you have the next pick in your four course meal draft. Well, I've seen that the second course
[12:46.730 --> 12:53.770]  is typically a soup or a salad. So I'm right for a salad in this instance. And I went with a classic
[12:53.770 --> 13:00.770]  blue cheese wedge side salad to start this meal off. When you open with blue, I thought you were
[13:00.770 --> 13:04.210]  doing another bloom. I thought we were like getting bloom and cheese or something.
[13:05.910 --> 13:09.850]  Oh, now we're talking though. A blue cheese wedge salad.
[13:12.170 --> 13:21.610]  Now, is it blue, B-L-U-E or E-U? I think it's E-U. I thought so too. And then my autocorrect
[13:21.610 --> 13:27.890]  changed it to this. So I'm really not sure. But there you go. Anyway, great pick. I think that's
[13:27.890 --> 13:33.410]  a really good pick. I love like I think a wedge salad is nice. I think having everything on it
[13:33.410 --> 13:40.090]  like that is a topic. You guys salad guys or no? I disagree with that. Yeah, big time. I love
[13:40.090 --> 13:45.350]  salad. Okay. That's what I wanted to hear. Gavin, what's up with that? The wedge is just too much
[13:45.350 --> 13:50.490]  lettuce. The ratio is off. Are you looking at this picture here, Gavin? You can make that last.
[13:50.750 --> 13:55.770]  The picture with the New Zealand flag by it? Or Australia, whatever that is? Yeah, that one.
[13:56.150 --> 14:02.050]  It's a shitload of lettuce. It's a shitload of sauce. Sauce? Dressing, whatever, man. Come on.
[14:02.050 --> 14:07.450]  Oh, prawn. I'm just looking for a condiment. That's a shitload of pedantic. Are you are you
[14:07.450 --> 14:11.430]  saying the problem is it's too much to eat? Yeah, it's just too much lettuce to eat. Oh,
[14:11.710 --> 14:15.510]  he's just saying that wedge salad is too big. Did you realize there are size portions though? Like
[14:15.510 --> 14:19.870]  this isn't you could get a size. I just mean in the ratios of the lettuce to everything else,
[14:19.870 --> 14:24.130]  it's like really high. In Gavin's defense, I would say I think the wedge salad is typically
[14:24.550 --> 14:29.850]  way too much over indexes on lettuce compared to other salads and is always comically big.
[14:30.790 --> 14:33.870]  That's fair, I suppose. Like anytime I go to a steak restaurant and I see one.
[14:34.130 --> 14:37.230]  His first pick was Bloomin' Onion. It's already huge. So we're going with like,
[14:37.410 --> 14:41.590]  I think Nick's just picking big meal stuff. Yeah, Nick is picking Nick portion. Yeah,
[14:41.630 --> 14:45.390]  a hundred percent. Yeah, there's monkey money in here. He's going crazy. We're going big and
[14:45.390 --> 14:52.510]  then going home. I'm not going home for a long time. Well, there you go. That's Nick's pick is
[14:52.510 --> 14:57.930]  the blue cheese wedge salad. I maybe went a different direction from you guys, but that's
[14:57.930 --> 15:02.610]  fine. My four course meal, my next up, I want like a little appetizer-y kind of thing, but
[15:02.610 --> 15:06.330]  something that's like, you're right, because it is soup salad. So I need something that's
[15:06.330 --> 15:09.790]  going to fill you up just a little bit after the appetizer. We're going with the french fry.
[15:11.150 --> 15:16.970]  That is, that specifically, top-notch french fries right there. Those are the ones that I'm
[15:16.970 --> 15:21.810]  eating. That's what I'm serving. That's my four course right here. Crack open a Coors banquet,
[15:22.290 --> 15:26.130]  sit down, you're having a couple of sips, and I go, are you ready for your next course? And you
[15:26.130 --> 15:29.450]  can go, I'm still working on the first, and I go, don't worry about it. And then I just put down
[15:29.450 --> 15:35.410]  a plate of french fries in front of you. Incredible, incredible second course for you
[15:35.410 --> 15:40.770]  to be working on my four course meal draft. Thoughts on french fries? Well, which course
[15:40.770 --> 15:44.690]  are you ordering from in the menu? Because it can't be on the sides, surely? Right, this is
[15:44.690 --> 15:51.830]  the salad portion. Okay. I'm not sure what confusion is. Soup, Coors banquet, salad,
[15:51.830 --> 15:57.210]  french fry. Okay. I'm not sure what the confusion, I think it makes perfect sense.
[15:59.650 --> 16:04.210]  Hey, don't, it's his perfect meal. That's right. Who are we to judge? It's his four course meal,
[16:04.330 --> 16:08.570]  yeah, we can't. Who are we to judge? That's what we do, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, judge it all you
[16:08.570 --> 16:15.850]  want, just know, like Andrew said earlier, I'm right. There is a vibe to Eric's board that I
[16:15.850 --> 16:23.730]  really like. Yeah. Yeah, it's probably like divorce dad, but I do like it. I think Eric's
[16:23.730 --> 16:28.830]  four courses so far he could eat leaning on a counter. Oh yeah, that's mostly how I eat,
[16:28.870 --> 16:33.150]  that's mostly how I eat my meals. Do you not eat leaning on a counter? I could do that with mine,
[16:33.190 --> 16:39.050]  what are you talking about? What are you sitting like a bitch? Yeah, I guess,
[16:39.050 --> 16:42.690]  uh, when I think prawn cocktail, I'm never just like leading.
[16:45.770 --> 16:52.550]  He's sitting like a bitch. Oh man, well, french fries is in the draft and now we go to Gavin.
[16:52.750 --> 16:57.070]  Let's see where he's going in his four course meal draft. Uh, to be honest, once I'm done with
[16:57.070 --> 17:03.230]  my start, I just want to get tucked in. I'm going to get tucked in. What? Time to tuck Gavin in.
[17:03.430 --> 17:07.230]  I want to go to sleep and get in bed. No, I'm going to just get started on the main.
[17:07.230 --> 17:14.130]  Uh, my, my second course, meat. Okay, so are we saying steak? If you want to be specific,
[17:14.230 --> 17:19.830]  that's a, that's a bone-in filet with peppercorn sauce. Okay. Okay. And uh, I just find that to
[17:19.830 --> 17:24.710]  be delicious, or a fillet is I would say. So you, you had a specific thing in mind,
[17:24.750 --> 17:29.170]  but you just described it as meat was the move? He just wanted to block everybody else from doing
[17:29.170 --> 17:33.870]  that. Just want everyone to shut the fuck up and point out that there's french fries on that plate.
[17:33.870 --> 17:38.670]  That's true. Yeah, it can come with a side. Perfect accompaniment. I mean, I'm not arguing
[17:38.670 --> 17:43.710]  with you. It's fine. I think he clearly went to your place, Eric, and he brought that with him.
[17:44.050 --> 17:48.910]  Exactly. Yeah. He grabbed all my french fries and then sat down and started eating his bone-in filet.
[17:50.270 --> 17:55.150]  I've reached over to the counter. You were hosting a very specific bring your own steak event.
[17:55.370 --> 18:02.110]  You provided the fries. I provide all the french fries. I mean, the main course can come with sides
[18:02.110 --> 18:08.510]  still, right? It's a side. Yeah. Yeah. Incredible. It's on the side. Incredible. It is on the side.
[18:08.930 --> 18:15.650]  Maybe add with fries. That is a really bad deal. With fries then. To do a split of steak and fries
[18:15.650 --> 18:20.390]  and have one person cover all the steak expenses and the other one is on fries. I got the fries,
[18:20.530 --> 18:28.390]  guys. Don't worry about it. Well, Gavin, uh, with the bone-in filet with peppercorn sauce with fries,
[18:29.230 --> 18:33.890]  with his second pick. But now that Geoff has had some time to come up with his next three,
[18:34.050 --> 18:38.190]  we're going to see what his next two are. Oh, I'm way ahead of you. You have the second course
[18:38.190 --> 18:43.010]  and the third course. I'm way I'm although I don't worry. I got the second course on lockdown.
[18:43.170 --> 18:46.490]  We'll be right. You had time to come up with it. I got plenty of time between second and third
[18:46.490 --> 18:51.870]  course to figure that out. The second course for me, I'm going in the same vein as Gavin because
[18:51.870 --> 18:55.250]  I need to. Well, there's a very specific structure to how I want to work this. And so I got to go
[18:55.250 --> 19:00.110]  straight from my main as well. And similarly to Gavin, I'm going bovine, but I'm going with the
[19:00.110 --> 19:06.770]  ultimate cut of beef, the best of the bunch. It doesn't get any better than a perfectly cooked
[19:06.770 --> 19:14.810]  prime rib. Oh, prime rib. Good pick. Um, you are you a prime rib guy, Geoff? Yeah, I love to cook
[19:14.810 --> 19:21.930]  it. Uh, uh, I love to eat it. I eat it, eat it as food and I enjoy it. Andrew, you're at prime rib.
[19:23.470 --> 19:28.530]  I, I don't, I don't think so. Not with the bone, certainly. Yeah, I haven't either. You've never
[19:28.530 --> 19:31.690]  had prime rib, Nick? Oh, I've had it. I've never had it with the bone. With the bone. Yeah, I've
[19:31.690 --> 19:35.890]  had prime rib, just never with the bone. Well, they never bone in. Like, they slice off some
[19:35.890 --> 19:43.150]  for you though, right? But how am I supposed to hold it? It's a joke. I saw the look on your face.
[19:43.410 --> 19:51.030]  I was stunned. I was stunned. He said it. I was stunned. I didn't know what to say. Um,
[19:51.030 --> 19:56.690]  well, prime rib has made the list. That's Geoff's second course, but because of sneak draft,
[19:57.070 --> 20:04.270]  Geoff gets the third course first. So Geoff, where are you going next? Exactly as I wanted. Uh,
[20:04.270 --> 20:08.310]  I get the third course first. This is how I planned it. This is how I conceived the whole
[20:08.310 --> 20:14.450]  evening. I, my heart tells me to go mashed potato as a side, but I'm looking at my meal and I'm
[20:14.450 --> 20:18.730]  trying to make a complete meal here. And I feel like there's not enough greenery on my plate.
[20:18.730 --> 20:22.630]  You know, I just have some tomato in the bruschetta really. And, and just the tiniest
[20:22.630 --> 20:26.730]  bit of parsley. So I, I just, I don't want to, uh, I know I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy,
[20:26.850 --> 20:32.850]  but I'm also a meat and Brussels sprouts kind of guy. And so I'm going crispy Brussels sprouts.
[20:33.010 --> 20:40.110]  Okay. I like that. As my, as my third course, you ordered it when we went to, uh, when we went
[20:40.110 --> 20:44.370]  out for steak at our steak dinner, I had, I ordered crispy Brussels sprouts. That is good.
[20:45.150 --> 20:50.890]  I, I love, I love a Brussels sprout in this form. Fantastic. Why are you laughing, Gavin?
[20:51.390 --> 20:57.650]  This is a course that's insane. Yeah. I will say it's a side. Yeah, I think it's great. It's a
[20:57.650 --> 21:01.450]  side. Exactly. That's what I'm ordering. This is my side meat. This is my side course. I could be
[21:01.450 --> 21:07.590]  with you as one thing. Geoff, Geoff, don't listen to these fools. How can it be a part of my main
[21:07.590 --> 21:11.150]  course? I think it's a great pick. I think it's a great pick. What the fuck are you talking about?
[21:11.770 --> 21:15.970]  Fantastic pick. And also, I'm going to pick these nine things and make them one course.
[21:16.110 --> 21:19.650]  That's not how it works, dude. That is how it's called a course. Yeah. It's a course.
[21:20.130 --> 21:25.530]  Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. It's not a four item meal. You're a four item meal. Oh yeah.
[21:30.770 --> 21:34.210]  Before we move away from Brussels sprout, I just want to say, Geoff, you make a delicious
[21:34.210 --> 21:39.490]  grilled Brussels sprout. I've never had a better one than the Brussels sprout I had made by you.
[21:39.490 --> 21:48.630]  Thank you very much, Andrew. I'm sorry. What year was that? 2016? 2015? Okay. Andrew actually
[21:48.630 --> 21:52.870]  knew me when I was a better cook. I used to cook a hell of a lot more than I do now. That's what
[21:52.870 --> 21:55.310]  I was going to ask is, do you think you've improved? Because I'd love for you to take
[21:55.310 --> 21:58.930]  another crack at it. Oh, I cook Brussels sprouts all the time, but I'm not as good as I used to be.
[22:00.830 --> 22:05.130]  Every time I cook a steak, I cook Brussels sprouts. Dang. Anytime I see Brussels sprouts,
[22:05.130 --> 22:07.770]  I think they won't be as good as Geoff's and they've never been.
[22:08.130 --> 22:11.430]  Geoff's best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. Kindest thing you've ever said to me. Delicious.
[22:14.670 --> 22:20.410]  Well, now that Gavin's done sniping at Geoff, he has the next pick, his third course here
[22:20.410 --> 22:28.130]  in the four course meal draft. Thinking about it? Gavin? Giving yourself a little bit of a reboot?
[22:28.530 --> 22:32.090]  Well, I want to make sure that we don't talk at the same time. So we're going to give Gavin
[22:32.090 --> 22:38.850]  all the space in the world to say what he has to say. Cocktail sauce. He's going with a cocktail
[22:38.850 --> 22:47.370]  prawn for his third pick. For me, I'm after my main, you know, after I've got some meat and fries
[22:47.370 --> 22:54.290]  down my neck. I want dessert. That's next for me. I'm having a little chocolate fondue, dipping
[22:54.290 --> 22:59.850]  stuff in melted chocolate. Delicious. Bit of fruit in there. Perfect. That's dessert. Take me to the
[22:59.850 --> 23:05.130]  melting pot. That is my dessert. Chocolate fondue. I would have it like a, you know, one of the
[23:05.750 --> 23:13.430]  actively hot pots, though, and not just like in a bowl. Oh. You big fondue guy? I don't mind it.
[23:13.570 --> 23:19.170]  I don't think I've ever had fondue. Geoff, any thoughts on chocolate fondue? I mean, I'm not
[23:19.170 --> 23:24.610]  crazy about it. I think it's a weird way to defend it by saying, do you like it? And have you go,
[23:24.610 --> 23:29.530]  I'm not mad at it. I don't hate it. Is it like a whole meal? I could, you know, give or take the
[23:29.530 --> 23:34.570]  rest. But the dessert's wicked. Now is the fondue at the table or do you have a fondue fountain in
[23:34.570 --> 23:40.890]  this place that you have to go to? If someone wheeled out like a currently running chocolate
[23:40.890 --> 23:46.130]  fountain, that'd be incredible. That would be such a cool move. A restaurant where you could
[23:46.130 --> 23:51.110]  order fondue for the restaurant, like they just wheel it out and it's anyone's welcome to just
[23:51.110 --> 23:56.370]  get some fondue going. Next round's on me. You know, going for the dessert, like right here.
[23:56.530 --> 24:01.530]  Interesting. I'm very curious to see where Gavin goes with his fourth course. Oh, I think I know
[24:01.530 --> 24:05.670]  where he's going. Gavin's fourth course is going to be a McDonald's cheeseburger on his way home
[24:05.670 --> 24:12.090]  from the restaurant because he was still hungry. Yeah, no kidding. And speaking of, Andrew,
[24:12.250 --> 24:18.090]  I think that's a very interesting point because my pick is next and it's two or three hamburgers.
[24:20.050 --> 24:26.770]  So is that... I love that it's top-notch. Yep. Is that total for the party or is it how many
[24:26.770 --> 24:31.250]  you're each person? No, per person. Yeah, per person. You're allowed to have like two or three hamburgers.
[24:31.750 --> 24:35.690]  You might, you can have one if you want, but just know you're able to have like,
[24:36.030 --> 24:40.550]  you know, like two or three hamburgers. This draft is making me realize how much I hang out
[24:40.550 --> 24:45.230]  with Gavin's wife without Gavin. I just went to top-notch with Meg like three days ago.
[24:48.390 --> 24:54.890]  I couldn't go because I was editing the Gunpla. I was just at that restaurant with your wife.
[24:57.850 --> 25:03.430]  That's really something. That's really something. Eric is just taking me deeper into the divorce
[25:03.430 --> 25:09.730]  dad territory of we're at his place, he's got the quarters, putting some french fries in the oven,
[25:09.850 --> 25:15.290]  the George Foreman grill is on the counter ready to go. Listen, I think that it's important that
[25:15.290 --> 25:21.690]  everyone get what they want. And two or three hamburgers is what I want. So I hope you want that also.
[25:22.050 --> 25:26.570]  If your fourth course isn't a store-bought dessert, I'm going to be very disappointed.
[25:28.150 --> 25:33.210]  My fourth course is a taco taco. You'll have to wait and see. You ever go and buy a whole birthday cake from
[25:33.210 --> 25:38.290]  Vaughn's? You're about to see something. But before we get to my fourth course, we have to get to
[25:38.290 --> 25:43.290]  Nick's third. Nick, what's your third course? Well, this is the main course. It is the main course.
[25:43.290 --> 25:49.170]  You know, the main dish. And of course, you get a couple sides with that. And in this instance,
[25:49.210 --> 25:54.490]  I'm going to go with a ribeye, a loaded baked potato, and some...
[25:56.470 --> 26:01.350]  Starting to see kind of what Nick... Nick's ideal meal is just at one place where he could go right
[26:01.350 --> 26:05.430]  now if he wanted. What do you mean? This is something to make at home. Nick's ideal meal
[26:05.430 --> 26:11.450]  is the buffet at Golden Corral. Hey, look at that. Yeah, look at that lower right-hand
[26:11.450 --> 26:15.450]  corner of that cutting board. What do you mean? Look at the inside of Nick here. I have an
[26:15.450 --> 26:21.930]  extensive collection of cutting boards. Yeah. Okay. What am I listing this as, Nick? Ribeye
[26:21.930 --> 26:31.690]  with fully loaded baked potato. Oh no, it's too far gone, buddy. And broccoli. And forget.
[26:32.590 --> 26:37.110]  There's not enough room to autopsy that potato on that plate there like your wife did.
[26:37.110 --> 26:41.130]  No. She'd find a way. You can't flay it like Ramsey Holton.
[26:41.230 --> 26:49.250]  She would put that steak on Nick's plate and then do her whole potato thing. Were you there?
[26:52.870 --> 26:58.290]  All right. Well, I'm really getting a look at the inside of Nick, but it's something that I already
[26:58.290 --> 27:02.610]  knew and sort of what I expected. It's fucking greasy and full of cholesterol. Yeah, it's
[27:02.610 --> 27:09.590]  exactly what I thought it would be. Are you my doctor? Andrew, you get the last pick of the
[27:09.590 --> 27:15.130]  third course, but you also get the first final course. So how are you going to kick off your
[27:15.130 --> 27:21.030]  third course here? I'm trying to decide if I could be so bold as to claim a vegetable medley as part
[27:21.030 --> 27:27.190]  of my dish. But I feel like that. Yeah, that's a yeah by you. I feel like that's like eight picks
[27:27.190 --> 27:36.690]  and one. OK, well, then I am going to go with a chicken parmesan with twice baked potato and
[27:37.850 --> 27:41.830]  vegetable medley. That is my main. So what was the issue? What was the fear with the
[27:41.830 --> 27:46.330]  vegetable medley that it couldn't be a part of it? Because I'm technically taking broccoli
[27:46.330 --> 27:51.390]  and carrots and like he's taking the produce aisle green bean. I'm taking a bunch. Yeah,
[27:51.410 --> 27:56.070]  it's a lot. It's a lot of things. But it's all it's all baked into a small enough portion to be
[27:56.070 --> 27:59.710]  one thing. Sure, that's fair. I just from this point, you know, like I've been taking very
[27:59.710 --> 28:05.010]  specific items, but I see you going with the ribeye fully baked and Gavin with the filet,
[28:05.330 --> 28:11.370]  whatever, peppercorn with fries. So I'm going to add a few to mine as well as a main. That is my
[28:11.370 --> 28:16.870]  main course. Of course, I think it's great. That's that's a lot going on, too, with the chicken
[28:16.870 --> 28:22.670]  parm. That's a you got a whole meal going on right there. Do you? Yep. Yeah. Pretty, pretty
[28:22.670 --> 28:28.090]  heavy stuff, but stuff that stuff that looks pretty good. Now, Andrew, that's a that's a lot.
[28:28.170 --> 28:32.130]  You're stacked up on your three courses. How you rounding this out here? There's a lot of
[28:32.130 --> 28:39.610]  different ways you can go at dessert. I'm not the biggest dessert fan, so it's tough. It's difficult
[28:39.610 --> 28:45.970]  because when I lean dessert, I typically go with like a pie, but I don't feel like that's fitting.
[28:45.970 --> 28:53.950]  So I am going to draft as part of my theme, a space cake. What's a space cake? I think it's
[28:53.950 --> 29:03.230]  a cake with weed in it from what I'm Googling. I Googled space cake and it says belonging to
[29:03.230 --> 29:09.170]  a group of cannabis infused edibles. So I bought the space cake thinking it's a goofy name.
[29:09.290 --> 29:13.450]  Everybody's getting high. I didn't know. I'm not aware of what's going on. We're just really we're
[29:13.450 --> 29:20.910]  popping out this experience in an unexpected way. And that concludes my theme. I got. Hey,
[29:21.090 --> 29:30.090]  hey, I've never been blindsided before. Let me detail. That was a front side blindside. So this
[29:30.090 --> 29:33.730]  is this is what I'm thinking with my thing. I kind of got a thing going here where the bread
[29:33.730 --> 29:38.330]  bread is just there. As Gavin said, it is you show up, but it's there. But I feel like it's a key
[29:38.330 --> 29:44.830]  part. I want to make sure I have it from that point on. We went from the sea with the barbecue
[29:44.830 --> 29:51.490]  bacon wrapped prawn. Then we got a bird as well as with the potato, something from the earth,
[29:51.570 --> 29:58.230]  something from the ground. So we concluded this four course experience going to outer space with
[29:58.230 --> 30:04.570]  the space cake. Everybody's getting high off the cake. I wanted to cover multiple layers. I wanted
[30:04.570 --> 30:10.170]  sea. I wanted ground. I wanted air. And now we're in space to round out this fourth course.
[30:10.410 --> 30:14.530]  Are you the Winston Churchill of four course meals? I sure am, Nick, and I'm glad you're
[30:14.530 --> 30:20.790]  finally seeing it. Really incredible. Wow. All the elements are present in Andrew.
[30:21.290 --> 30:26.350]  Absolutely. And Andrew brings the heart. That's the food pyramid, of course.
[30:29.190 --> 30:34.550]  Well, Andrew's rounded out his four courses here. Very interesting. And now it's time
[30:34.550 --> 30:38.390]  for Nick to take us down under and let us know what his fourth course is.
[30:38.650 --> 30:43.290]  Oh, it's funny you should mention that because I... dessert. One of my favorite things. I love
[30:43.290 --> 30:49.150]  dessert. Chocolate cake. Excellent pick. I love chocolate cake, but specifically this type of
[30:49.150 --> 30:57.910]  chocolate cake, which is, of course, the chocolate thunder from down under. Is that cake? Yeah.
[30:58.690 --> 31:02.930]  It's a brownie, actually. Okay. With a bunch of ice cream and then whipped cream?
[31:03.450 --> 31:08.030]  It looks like the brownie is the least of it. Nick, once you get a slice of my space cake,
[31:08.090 --> 31:10.250]  you can call it whatever you want. It's all fine. We're all good.
[31:11.110 --> 31:14.650]  Is this chocolate thunder down under? Is that what it's called? From down under.
[31:15.050 --> 31:19.950]  Okay. Okay. I think by the dessert on Nick's plate, I'm like 6,000 calories in.
[31:20.430 --> 31:27.270]  I mean, at least. My favorite kind of cake is this brownie with ice cream on it.
[31:27.570 --> 31:32.230]  Listen, cake is brownie. Brownie can be cake. If a shrimp had Nick's four course meal,
[31:32.230 --> 31:41.530]  it would be a prawn by the end of the dinner. Oh, man. Well, Nick really rounded it out there.
[31:41.650 --> 31:46.870]  I'm pretty impressed. He stayed in one lane and he did a great job. Roll me home, baby.
[31:49.550 --> 31:53.670]  He loves it so much, too. Everything he picked, he would be so excited for.
[31:54.930 --> 32:00.950]  Well, I've had an appetizer. There's a soup salad kind of situation. And then we got the main
[32:00.950 --> 32:07.330]  course. You're full. You're stuffed. I've had about six or seven appetizers
[32:07.990 --> 32:14.290]  with my salad and my main course. So you're really feeling full. So it's time for an aperitif
[32:14.290 --> 32:20.050]  to round this out. And there's only one aperitif for me. And that's Coors Light
[32:20.650 --> 32:26.410]  to round this thing out. You don't want something too heavy. You don't want something that's gonna
[32:26.410 --> 32:33.110]  weigh you down. You've already had a pretty filling meal. And now it's just time to, you know,
[32:33.490 --> 32:38.130]  crack a cold one. The mountains are blue. And have a nice time with your friends as you wind
[32:38.130 --> 32:44.470]  down the evening and celebrate responsibly. Can you imagine taking someone on a date to a fancy
[32:44.470 --> 32:48.990]  restaurant and the four courses are what Eric picked? And each one comes out with like a little
[32:48.990 --> 32:54.490]  cloche. Hey, it's how he got married. Who said anything about a fancy restaurant? This is a
[32:54.490 --> 33:00.470]  four-course meal draft, baby. I would just love to see that happen at a restaurant. And I'd love
[33:00.470 --> 33:04.970]  to see the woman's reaction. I mean, the dude's married, so it clearly worked. It worked, baby.
[33:05.210 --> 33:11.410]  Yep. Hey, the only banquet we need is Coors Banquet. Guys, those are my four courses.
[33:11.810 --> 33:15.230]  Eric's restaurant, coincidentally, is a place that his parents live above.
[33:17.050 --> 33:21.330]  Right. They do, but they don't own it. Some call it a basement, some call it a suite,
[33:21.330 --> 33:26.210]  some call it a restaurant. I don't know. That's right. I call it the downstairs neighbor's house.
[33:26.630 --> 33:34.690]  His name is Dave and we hang out. Those are my four courses, but it's time for Gavin to round us
[33:34.690 --> 33:39.790]  out with his fourth and final course in this four-course meal draft. My fourth and final
[33:39.790 --> 33:45.550]  course is a two-stage course. Okay, that's... I want two things from this. So it's a five-course
[33:45.550 --> 33:52.830]  meal? Well, you know, let's see what you think. What I want is the check and a lovely cup of tea
[33:52.830 --> 34:00.730]  at home. And that's course four. I'm gonna say yeah. I'm gonna agree with this. Go for it, man.
[34:00.970 --> 34:04.450]  Yeah, no, I'm all for this because now I know that Gavin will lose this draft,
[34:04.550 --> 34:10.970]  no matter the fan love for this guy. What a dump of a final course on a fantastic meal
[34:10.970 --> 34:14.630]  that he could have had. I'd like to change my answer. No, no, no, no, you're good. You're
[34:14.630 --> 34:19.330]  locked in. He's already written. And then I'd like everyone to check it out because cheeseburger
[34:19.330 --> 34:23.690]  is on the check, which is the thing that I have. So that's fine. It's not a big deal.
[34:24.310 --> 34:29.950]  Hey, hey, hey, you come eat at my restaurant, guys. Gavin picks up the check. All right,
[34:30.050 --> 34:34.090]  Gavin, maybe you can save it. Maybe you can save it. What kind of tea? No, he can't. Oh, it's...
[34:34.090 --> 34:38.830]  oh, great. There's no saving it. Solid tea? That's a solid tea. Oh, yeah. Oh, there's no saving it.
[34:38.830 --> 34:42.590]  A hundred percent. No, no, no, no. I was giving him false hope. This is going to sound a lot
[34:42.590 --> 34:46.790]  harsher than I mean, Gavin, but I think that might be the worst pick anyone has ever made
[34:46.790 --> 34:52.870]  in anybody's draft. Cup of tea? Gavin, Gavin, Gavin, he's on your side. Check and a cup of
[34:52.870 --> 34:56.330]  tea at home. I don't want to eat three. I don't want to eat four courses. I've done it three.
[34:56.470 --> 35:00.510]  I completely get where you're coming from. I just think it's the worst pick anyone's ever made.
[35:00.850 --> 35:05.690]  I mean, yeah. And I don't mean that aggressively. You can have it like it's, you know,
[35:05.690 --> 35:11.030]  you're coming from. But this is the man who who made fun of crack rock.
[35:12.130 --> 35:16.930]  Yeah, I was wrong. I was on the wrong side of history. A crack rock. If you presented me with
[35:16.930 --> 35:22.730]  with this as a meal itinerary, I'd freaking love that. That sounds incredible. Wait,
[35:22.810 --> 35:29.190]  so if I presented you with that, am I saying that I'm going to leave and pay for your meal
[35:29.990 --> 35:35.390]  in that context? Like, that's what's weird about it is I feel like I'm giving you
[35:35.390 --> 35:38.470]  our dinner plans and also what I plan to do as soon as we're done.
[35:40.190 --> 35:43.230]  Well, I'm looking at that and I'm thinking that's a meal that's going to be slightly
[35:43.230 --> 35:48.010]  shorter than all the others. And I think that's brilliant. I just I'd be looking at it going,
[35:48.390 --> 35:53.430]  dude, does he want me to go to his house? Am I supposed to have tea with him?
[35:53.790 --> 35:58.470]  Yes. Are we invited to your house for tea? Is he just telling me that what his plans are
[35:58.470 --> 36:02.650]  after we have the dinner? It is a bit confusing. It is kind of odd.
[36:02.650 --> 36:07.610]  Should I just put a cup of tea at home? I mean, are we invited to the tea?
[36:08.190 --> 36:12.570]  Gavin, when do you think the courses stop? Am I selling this meal or am I eating this meal?
[36:12.790 --> 36:15.430]  That's you know what? I think that's for you to set up. Is this in your home?
[36:15.630 --> 36:19.650]  Are you presenting this at your house? I just was drafting a four course meal
[36:19.650 --> 36:21.330]  that I would want to eat. You want to eat the check?
[36:21.950 --> 36:25.570]  Wow. Yum, yum. Hell of a pick, Gav. Hell of a pick.
[36:25.590 --> 36:29.670]  Yeah, it's great. Great final pick, Gavin. Awesome. Awesome drafting.
[36:29.670 --> 36:32.850]  I stand by my pick. I think it's a wicked final course.
[36:33.370 --> 36:36.490]  Yeah, absolutely. I stand by your pick also. Way to go.
[36:36.750 --> 36:39.370]  I think everybody's standing by their pick. Yeah, I think everyone's standing by their pick.
[36:39.550 --> 36:41.150]  Great work. Ten toes down.
[36:43.110 --> 36:47.370]  Well, Geoff is standing on business as he rounds out his fourth and final course here.
[36:47.570 --> 36:50.650]  He's going to end the four course meal draft. Geoff, take us out big style.
[36:51.030 --> 36:57.270]  So my fourth and final course is a newer one for me. It's a bit aspirational,
[36:57.270 --> 37:01.930]  but I feel like it also is related to the maturation process of Geoff.
[37:02.770 --> 37:05.930]  Something you may not know about me is that I'm a big dessert guy.
[37:06.170 --> 37:10.010]  Now, I didn't used to be a big dessert guy. That has come to me later in life
[37:10.010 --> 37:14.930]  for one specific reason that I bet a lot of people don't know is that when you're an alcoholic,
[37:15.550 --> 37:19.290]  one of the things that you become super addicted to, obviously the alcohol.
[37:19.630 --> 37:23.770]  The other thing is the fucking sugar and alcohol. There's so much sugar and alcohol.
[37:23.770 --> 37:31.730]  I never was into candy or sweets growing up. But after I got sober, I developed a sweet tooth
[37:31.730 --> 37:35.250]  that has just beaten the shit out of me for the last couple of years.
[37:35.970 --> 37:39.790]  And so I'm trying to break free of that. I'm tempted to pick a banana split. I'm tempted to
[37:39.790 --> 37:44.370]  pick a slice of cheesecake. I'm scared that you guys are going to Gavin me here for this.
[37:44.570 --> 37:52.170]  But my final pick is going to be an aperitif as well. I just want... I'm trying to teach myself
[37:52.170 --> 37:55.690]  to appreciate the simplicity of a little espresso.
[37:55.970 --> 37:57.090]  Oh, I think that's a great pick.
[37:57.250 --> 37:58.990]  Oh, what a finale.
[37:59.410 --> 38:01.050]  Yeah, I think that's a great pick.
[38:02.410 --> 38:02.770]  Fantastic.
[38:03.630 --> 38:04.570]  Yeah, I think that's phenomenal.
[38:04.590 --> 38:05.330]  10 out of 10.
[38:05.530 --> 38:09.890]  Here's the thing, because you can sit, you can sip, you're still hanging out,
[38:10.010 --> 38:12.970]  you're winding down the evening. People see it and they go,
[38:13.030 --> 38:16.090]  oh, isn't it a little late for that? And you go, oh, no, as an end to the meal,
[38:16.170 --> 38:20.150]  you need it because you're dragging just a hair. Let's have some sips. Let's walk it off.
[38:20.150 --> 38:25.250]  Let's enjoy this evening air together. Geoff, I think a little espresso is a great pick.
[38:25.330 --> 38:25.670]  I love it.
[38:25.710 --> 38:26.630]  Thank you. I appreciate it.
[38:26.670 --> 38:28.710]  That's what I picked, but just with half as much caffeine.
[38:29.170 --> 38:30.990]  No, no, no. You pick the check and go home.
[38:30.990 --> 38:31.970]  No, check and cup of tea.
[38:31.970 --> 38:33.430]  Geoff is enjoying...
[38:33.430 --> 38:34.730]  I'm still at the dinner table, dude.
[38:34.830 --> 38:40.010]  Exactly. Geoff is enjoying the night, regaling us with tales. Things unheard.
[38:40.270 --> 38:41.910]  I'm telling stories about Gavin now that he's gone.
[38:42.110 --> 38:44.970]  What if I just picked check and cup of tea at the restaurant?
[38:45.310 --> 38:46.590]  Yeah, I mean, that would have made more sense.
[38:46.870 --> 38:48.350]  Yeah, I think that would have been a way better pick.
[38:48.350 --> 38:48.850]  That would have been great.
[38:49.090 --> 38:49.510]  Pick it.
[38:49.510 --> 38:50.910]  So it's the at home.
[38:51.070 --> 38:53.250]  Because now we're locked in on the four-course meal draft.
[38:53.590 --> 38:54.150]  You dummy.
[38:54.590 --> 38:57.470]  We've done it. We've drafted all four courses.
[38:57.770 --> 39:01.530]  All five of us, which we did not randomize 20 times, only four.
[39:01.910 --> 39:03.410]  And this is how we landed.
[39:03.810 --> 39:05.090]  These are Geoff's four courses.
[39:05.270 --> 39:08.490]  Let us know in the comments who had the best four-course meal.
[39:08.790 --> 39:11.910]  And as Gavin will tell you later, there's a poll that you're able to vote in.
[39:11.990 --> 39:14.530]  Here's the pick order.
[39:14.530 --> 39:20.850]  Geoff, bruschetta, prime rib, crispy brussels sprouts, and a little espresso.
[39:21.110 --> 39:22.210]  Beautiful. Excellent.
[39:22.370 --> 39:24.570]  Gavin, starting strong with the prawn cocktail,
[39:24.910 --> 39:27.770]  then bone-in filet with peppercorn sauce with fries,
[39:28.490 --> 39:33.550]  chocolate fondue, and rounding out with the check and a cup of tea at home.
[39:35.230 --> 39:37.330]  I have picked Coors Banquet.
[39:37.550 --> 39:40.190]  French fries, two or three hamburgers, and Coors Light.
[39:40.590 --> 39:42.070]  Yeah, I know. I agree. I have some great picks.
[39:42.230 --> 39:43.550]  Those are great picks from me.
[39:43.550 --> 39:44.350]  And here's Nick.
[39:44.430 --> 39:47.970]  Nick is going out back and down under as we take it to the Bloomin' Onion,
[39:48.270 --> 39:50.150]  the blue cheese wedge salad,
[39:50.510 --> 39:52.590]  ribeye with fully loaded baked potato and broccoli,
[39:52.670 --> 39:55.090]  and finally the chocolate thunder down under.
[39:55.210 --> 39:55.970]  From down under.
[39:56.590 --> 39:57.150]  Okay.
[39:57.610 --> 40:03.970]  And Andrew, focaccia, bacon, barbecue, wrapped prawns,
[40:04.050 --> 40:07.850]  chicken parmesan with twice-baked potato and vegetable medley,
[40:07.910 --> 40:10.690]  and finally rounding it up with the space cake.
[40:11.010 --> 40:12.370]  Hey Gavin, you know what my check is?
[40:12.370 --> 40:13.850]  You know how expensive my meal is?
[40:15.350 --> 40:16.790]  You know how expensive you be paying?
[40:17.130 --> 40:18.210]  $4.20, baby!
[40:24.810 --> 40:26.390]  That's what I'm talking about.
[40:31.450 --> 40:36.510]  Man, that turned out so much better than I thought it would.
[40:36.830 --> 40:40.470]  A fantastic dinner for all of us.
[40:40.550 --> 40:41.970]  The Four Course Meal Draft.
[40:41.970 --> 40:44.130]  So different, each and every one of us,
[40:44.250 --> 40:47.970]  but the only people that can let us know who did it best is you at home.
[40:48.090 --> 40:49.370]  Leave a comment, vote in the poll,
[40:49.450 --> 40:52.550]  tell us what your perfect Four Course Meal is.
[40:53.210 --> 40:55.210]  That's the way that you can interact with this,
[40:55.210 --> 40:57.250]  and then we'll finally see who had the best Four Course Meal,
[40:57.390 --> 40:59.250]  and then we will get mad at one another.
[40:59.410 --> 41:02.230]  Thank you guys so much for listening to this.
[41:02.330 --> 41:05.970]  Check out the Patreon at patreon.com slash the regulation pod,
[41:06.230 --> 41:07.570]  and you're going to want to listen to the podcast.
[41:07.770 --> 41:08.910]  But before we take it out, boys,
[41:08.950 --> 41:11.850]  was there anything else that you left off your list
[41:11.970 --> 41:13.310]  Honorable Mentions?
[41:13.750 --> 41:16.130]  I was really close to drafting
[41:17.050 --> 41:21.650]  check and cup of tea at mom's home.
[41:22.850 --> 41:23.910]  Maybe grandparent's house.
[41:23.930 --> 41:24.950]  Yeah, it's a little different.
[41:25.010 --> 41:27.670]  You know what? I would have allowed it,
[41:27.830 --> 41:29.770]  but it probably would have been a little bit of a fight.
[41:29.870 --> 41:32.590]  Ice cream sandwich from the gas station on the way home.
[41:32.750 --> 41:34.570]  That's a great pick. What are you talking about?
[41:34.610 --> 41:35.410]  That's a perfect pick.
[41:35.810 --> 41:38.590]  Check-in patrolling the streets for an ice cream truck.
[41:39.150 --> 41:42.290]  If you'd eaten a prawn cocktail, a big old slab of meat,
[41:42.470 --> 41:45.490]  some fries, and you'd been dunking chocolate fondue,
[41:45.730 --> 41:46.830]  where do you want to be now?
[41:47.050 --> 41:48.330]  In the restaurant with my friends,
[41:48.430 --> 41:51.090]  enjoying the end of that meal and sharing stories,
[41:51.170 --> 41:53.650]  coming up with new ideas, enjoying company.
[41:53.850 --> 41:54.930]  Fellowship, as we call it.
[41:54.990 --> 41:57.070]  Do that during dessert. Do that while you eat dessert.
[41:57.330 --> 42:01.210]  I would feel kind of ripped off if one of the courses in my four-course meal
[42:01.210 --> 42:03.530]  was getting the check. That happens.
[42:03.830 --> 42:06.230]  It's part of every meal.
[42:06.950 --> 42:08.210]  And there's a tea.
[42:09.030 --> 42:11.630]  Yeah, but that's at home. You're doing that yourself.
[42:11.930 --> 42:13.430]  Yeah. Garcon.
[42:14.990 --> 42:16.830]  I changed my whole draft on the fly.
[42:16.970 --> 42:20.150]  I was originally going with broccolini, a cranberry feta and walnut salad,
[42:20.250 --> 42:21.990]  wagyu steak, and a blueberry empanada,
[42:22.310 --> 42:24.750]  but Coors Banquet sounded real good right now,
[42:24.850 --> 42:27.650]  so I just went with that and kind of saw where the day took me.
[42:28.070 --> 42:30.330]  Thank you guys so much for listening to this.
[42:30.450 --> 42:32.930]  So many drafts coming down the pipe.
[42:33.010 --> 42:35.310]  Want to thank you for supporting us directly on Patreon.
[42:35.990 --> 42:37.770]  Pipedraft! Heard it here first.
[42:38.430 --> 42:40.190]  See you next time. Bye!
[42:40.990 --> 42:42.590]  I can do crack rock again.
[42:42.890 --> 42:43.290]  Check, please.
