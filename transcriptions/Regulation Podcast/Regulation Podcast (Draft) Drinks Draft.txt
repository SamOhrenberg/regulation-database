[00:00.000 --> 00:02.340]  Hello and welcome to another draft.
[00:02.840 --> 00:04.880]  We have to start with ANAG, of course.
[00:05.040 --> 00:08.360]  First, this draft is non-alcoholic beverages.
[00:08.960 --> 00:12.760]  I'm excited to see how everyone goes with this direction.
[00:13.140 --> 00:14.800]  You could go so many ways, so many drinks.
[00:15.220 --> 00:16.420]  Where did this idea come from?
[00:17.680 --> 00:19.280]  I'm a big drink guy.
[00:19.520 --> 00:22.000]  I really like drinks and we're getting into the summer season.
[00:22.240 --> 00:26.880]  And part of the summer season for me is enjoying a nice cold beverage.
[00:27.640 --> 00:28.980]  Non-alcoholic for me.
[00:29.490 --> 00:31.400]  Are you really a big drinks guy?
[00:31.480 --> 00:35.380]  Because I would guess that you've had less than one percent of all drinks.
[00:36.460 --> 00:39.120]  I bet you've had way more drinks than you've had.
[00:39.500 --> 00:40.840]  We're going to line up the drinks.
[00:41.360 --> 00:42.760]  Well, now, hold on.
[00:42.860 --> 00:45.380]  Hold on, because Gavin is an alcoholic drink guy,
[00:45.440 --> 00:47.320]  which opens him up to a whole other world of drinks.
[00:47.340 --> 00:48.060]  It does.
[00:49.380 --> 00:50.640]  It's a great alcoholic drink guy.
[00:51.180 --> 00:53.120]  Well, I mean, you drink alcohol on occasion.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.660]  You have consumed alcohol.
[00:54.860 --> 00:58.280]  And Andrew said earlier, he doesn't drink alcohol.
[00:58.280 --> 00:59.820]  Not like an alcohol guy.
[01:00.240 --> 01:01.840]  No, no, no. An alcoholic guy.
[01:02.960 --> 01:04.520]  You're open to alcohol is what he's saying.
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.540]  So there's a wider range.
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.680]  Nobody's saying you're an alcoholic.
[01:07.960 --> 01:12.200]  We're saying you're just not restricted in what you drink in a way that Andrew is.
[01:12.220 --> 01:13.720]  Yeah, I just heard alcoholic drink guy.
[01:13.780 --> 01:14.740]  And I was like, oh, maybe I've got a problem.
[01:17.180 --> 01:18.440]  Well, I got news for you, buddy.
[01:18.500 --> 01:21.020]  If you're afraid you have a problem, you have a problem.
[01:22.700 --> 01:23.640]  I hate to break it to you.
[01:23.700 --> 01:25.080]  This is the blind side.
[01:25.680 --> 01:27.460]  Oh, this is your intervention.
[01:29.140 --> 01:32.560]  Oh, I love you very much.
[01:32.620 --> 01:34.840]  I haven't had a drink in four months.
[01:35.720 --> 01:36.900]  You must be thirsty.
[01:37.920 --> 01:39.080]  Yeah, I get it, Geoff.
[01:40.960 --> 01:44.840]  You guys are talking just before we start, you guys are talking about how your drinks
[01:44.840 --> 01:47.020]  guys, how many drinks you've had or whatever.
[01:47.260 --> 01:50.440]  This is the hardest draft list I have ever had to put together.
[01:50.560 --> 01:54.040]  I am not a drinks guy at all.
[01:54.640 --> 01:56.260]  And you strike me as a drinks guy.
[01:56.480 --> 01:57.920]  I guess non-alcoholic drinks guy.
[01:57.920 --> 01:59.560]  Yeah, I'm not a drinks guy.
[01:59.780 --> 02:00.880]  Are you? Are you an alcohol?
[02:01.120 --> 02:02.140]  Really? Like even alcohol?
[02:02.320 --> 02:03.740]  You strike me as a drinks guy.
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.020]  Oh, I'll drink. I drink booze like that's fine.
[02:06.020 --> 02:10.680]  But like as far as like just getting a drink for like pleasure
[02:11.280 --> 02:14.580]  is so like you like pleasure drink equipment.
[02:15.860 --> 02:16.860]  Yeah, right.
[02:17.160 --> 02:19.700]  And so that's one thing on my list.
[02:20.340 --> 02:25.200]  And then trying to round out the next is that is like I'm going like,
[02:25.480 --> 02:27.460]  do I like this drink?
[02:27.460 --> 02:29.120]  It's so bad.
[02:29.220 --> 02:31.880]  My I feel like my draft list is going to be rough.
[02:32.220 --> 02:33.520]  I'm excited to see it.
[02:34.360 --> 02:37.200]  Completely understand where Eric is coming from when I sat down.
[02:37.240 --> 02:39.860]  And because I think I thought like, oh, cool, this would be fun for me
[02:39.860 --> 02:41.140]  because I don't drink alcohol anymore.
[02:41.340 --> 02:44.360]  And I'm having soda summer, you know, and so I've been trying.
[02:44.460 --> 02:46.860]  I bought I bought so many sodas over to Gavin's house last weekend.
[02:46.920 --> 02:48.680]  Meg thanks you, by the way. She's tearing through those.
[02:49.060 --> 02:51.160]  Oh, good, good. That's what that's what they're there for.
[02:51.180 --> 02:54.860]  I want you guys to experience soda summer, learn about new flavors,
[02:54.860 --> 02:56.740]  find their soda summer this weekend.
[02:56.880 --> 02:57.780]  That's what it's all about.
[02:58.420 --> 02:59.740]  We can have soda summer this weekend.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.360]  However, when I sat down to write my list, I realized I don't really give a shit
[03:05.360 --> 03:08.800]  about any of it. I really it's whatever.
[03:09.100 --> 03:09.740]  It's fine.
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.060]  Every every this is the problem is a problem
[03:15.060 --> 03:17.020]  that may be specific to me as an alcoholic.
[03:17.900 --> 03:22.800]  But every every single drink that I thought of was an alcoholic drink.
[03:22.800 --> 03:25.900]  All of my favorite drinks on earth are alcoholic.
[03:26.280 --> 03:28.060]  To this day, seven years sober.
[03:28.260 --> 03:31.880]  I'm still like, oh, well, you're going through gins and you're like, stop, stop.
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.000]  So, oh, no, I'm I'm similarly struggled like Eric, I think.
[03:36.060 --> 03:40.080]  Yeah, I the same thing where it was just like I like tequila soda.
[03:40.180 --> 03:42.640]  Well, that's OK. Well, fuck a margarita.
[03:42.780 --> 03:44.440]  Goddamn. Like, it's just like a lot of that.
[03:44.620 --> 03:48.400]  Did you also do the thing where you're like best non-alcoholic drinks
[03:48.400 --> 03:51.420]  and they're like, here's the best non-alcoholic cocktail that you could have?
[03:51.420 --> 03:54.560]  Oh, yeah. It was mostly just cocktails that they wanted me to make.
[03:54.700 --> 03:57.400]  And then I just went, well, this I was going to do a bit.
[03:57.740 --> 04:00.560]  I was going to do a bit where I was going to go like.
[04:01.700 --> 04:05.360]  Virgin painkiller, virgin daiquiri, virgin margarita.
[04:05.620 --> 04:07.460]  But then I went, no, I'm going to try.
[04:07.800 --> 04:10.040]  I'm going to give it a shot and see how it goes.
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.580]  You guys are like, I got to try to put something together.
[04:13.800 --> 04:18.020]  Meanwhile, I am nervously sweating, looking at my draft board,
[04:18.100 --> 04:20.780]  trying to determine what Mountain Dew is the third best.
[04:20.780 --> 04:23.880]  It is. We've had completely different experience.
[04:24.040 --> 04:27.240]  So everyone is saying that they're not really a drinks guy.
[04:27.560 --> 04:30.620]  I only drink water. Yeah, I can't water.
[04:30.720 --> 04:33.000]  Yes. Yeah. Well, that's why you better.
[04:33.100 --> 04:34.960]  You better hope you're high on the draft board.
[04:38.700 --> 04:40.040]  And I got news for you, buddy.
[04:40.340 --> 04:41.820]  Water's on my list, too.
[04:42.280 --> 04:43.460]  It's a really good drink.
[04:44.740 --> 04:47.440]  It's not on mine. Some would say the best.
[04:50.040 --> 04:53.020]  The first time I had a Coke was in the Gerplichug.
[04:56.060 --> 04:59.600]  Oh, man. OK, well, we have Anig lined up.
[04:59.760 --> 05:01.520]  But how many times do we randomize?
[05:01.560 --> 05:03.860]  Is it 49? Because it's Geoff's birthday.
[05:05.340 --> 05:07.360]  Hey, Eric said it, not me. 49 it is.
[05:07.900 --> 05:10.360]  Most drinks have water. That's H2O. 2O is 20.
[05:11.360 --> 05:12.940]  Oh, how about 2? How about 2?
[05:13.080 --> 05:15.940]  But hold on. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
[05:15.940 --> 05:17.360]  H is the eighth letter.
[05:17.500 --> 05:20.600]  So how many times will eight go into twenty two times?
[05:20.700 --> 05:22.920]  Well, let's say eight is two to twelve.
[05:23.040 --> 05:24.400]  I'm pushing for two twelve.
[05:24.660 --> 05:27.120]  I want you to know I'm on H side here.
[05:27.280 --> 05:28.760]  Thank you. H minus 20 is twelve.
[05:30.920 --> 05:32.800]  OK. How many times are we randomizing?
[05:33.060 --> 05:34.440]  Two. I think we're doing twelve. Twelve.
[05:35.080 --> 05:36.040]  H minus 20 is twelve.
[05:39.380 --> 05:40.800]  I'm going. I'm voting two.
[05:41.780 --> 05:42.780]  It's got to be one of the two.
[05:43.220 --> 05:43.900]  OK, hang on. Wait.
[05:43.900 --> 05:46.580]  So we have two votes for two and two votes for twelve.
[05:46.980 --> 05:49.360]  Eric, replace all the names with the numbers one to ten.
[05:49.640 --> 05:51.000]  And we'll figure out how many times.
[05:51.220 --> 05:52.600]  No, because we have to take a vote.
[05:52.920 --> 05:53.760]  We have to take a vote.
[05:53.940 --> 05:56.380]  So there's two votes for two and two votes for twelve.
[05:56.580 --> 05:59.940]  And now Eric has all the power.
[06:01.220 --> 06:03.340]  Ah, we love the way this swung.
[06:03.420 --> 06:06.200]  And that's why we're doing it twelve times.
[06:06.900 --> 06:08.400]  We can edit the video.
[06:11.120 --> 06:13.400]  I did not expect that to go my way.
[06:13.880 --> 06:16.140]  I will. I'll make this smaller.
[06:16.460 --> 06:17.760]  It's never an awesome. Hang on.
[06:17.820 --> 06:19.200]  What good is this going to do?
[06:19.600 --> 06:23.500]  Because now when we randomize, this is always in the same spot.
[06:24.020 --> 06:25.720]  Oh, you could just throw a black bar.
[06:25.980 --> 06:27.420]  Oh, God, she's a VPN.
[06:29.760 --> 06:31.320]  First, first of twelve.
[06:32.540 --> 06:34.500]  Gavin, Geoff, Eric, Andrew, Nick.
[06:35.460 --> 06:37.500]  Why have we done this for every fucking draft?
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.720]  What do we do? Well, I can't even see it.
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.520]  That's why we're iterating.
[06:41.520 --> 06:44.580]  We're learning. Gavin, Geoff, Andrew, Nick, Eric.
[06:44.840 --> 06:45.600]  What the fuck?
[06:46.920 --> 06:48.600]  Oh, yeah. What the fuck?
[06:49.220 --> 06:50.160]  Get out of here, Gavin.
[06:50.360 --> 06:51.960]  Andrew, Nick, Geoff, Eric.
[06:52.240 --> 06:56.480]  Number four, Nick, Geoff, Gavin, Eric, Andrew. Five.
[06:58.020 --> 06:58.880]  Oh, number one.
[06:59.120 --> 07:00.700]  I want one so bad.
[07:00.780 --> 07:02.340]  It's the most I've ever wanted one.
[07:02.680 --> 07:04.540]  Here's six at Geoff at the top.
[07:04.640 --> 07:06.120]  I need one. I need it.
[07:06.320 --> 07:07.800]  Seven. Nick at the top.
[07:07.920 --> 07:08.960]  I need to be there. Eight.
[07:09.700 --> 07:10.560]  Eric at the top.
[07:11.600 --> 07:13.340]  Nine. Nick at the top.
[07:14.440 --> 07:16.320]  Ten. Geoff at the top.
[07:16.520 --> 07:20.260]  Eleven. Is Andrew, Gavin, Nick, Geoff, Eric.
[07:21.260 --> 07:23.920]  And now, number twelve.
[07:24.240 --> 07:28.780]  Come on! Gavin, Andrew, Nick, Eric, Geoff.
[07:28.940 --> 07:31.980]  No! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:32.300 --> 07:35.760]  God damn. I'm going to lose two of my picks in the first one.
[07:40.240 --> 07:41.200]  Oh, man.
[07:43.720 --> 07:49.860]  Fellas, we randomized twelve times, and now it's time for the best non-alcoholic drink draft to begin.
[07:50.320 --> 07:53.260]  Gavin, first pick here.
[07:53.540 --> 07:58.540]  How about for the prize of this, winner gets whatever their first pick is.
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.960]  Whatever their first round pick is.
[08:00.120 --> 08:00.940]  Ooh, interesting.
[08:02.120 --> 08:02.500]  Love it.
[08:03.540 --> 08:05.000]  On the house, on the company.
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.120]  On the company.
[08:06.760 --> 08:11.180]  I would also like to say, I'm willing to sell my slot in this draft.
[08:11.180 --> 08:12.780]  For twenty-five bucks.
[08:13.380 --> 08:13.840]  Geoff?
[08:15.140 --> 08:19.100]  I don't want to pay twenty-five dollars for his...
[08:19.100 --> 08:21.300]  Wait, what? Hold on. What number is he in the slot?
[08:21.820 --> 08:22.400]  He's number one?
[08:23.000 --> 08:23.200]  Yeah.
[08:23.960 --> 08:26.780]  So, you know, Apple Pay, cash, and it's all yours.
[08:28.040 --> 08:29.360]  Don't do it, Geoff. It's your birthday.
[08:30.600 --> 08:31.460]  Do you have Venmo?
[08:31.900 --> 08:32.740]  Geoff, don't do it!
[08:33.240 --> 08:33.820]  Got Venmo?
[08:34.380 --> 08:34.660]  No!
[08:37.200 --> 08:37.660]  Uh...
[08:37.660 --> 08:39.760]  No, no, no.
[08:40.440 --> 08:41.020]  Wow!
[08:41.360 --> 08:43.540]  My first pick...
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.220]  It's a very nice liquid.
[08:47.340 --> 08:49.740]  You're fucked. You have nothing for two through four.
[08:50.560 --> 08:55.880]  This is a very nice liquid that I'd never tried until I met a Geoffrey Ramsey.
[08:56.400 --> 08:58.580]  And that liquid is coffee.
[09:00.360 --> 09:01.700]  Oh, I should have...
[09:01.700 --> 09:02.780]  Eat shit, Eric!
[09:03.930 --> 09:04.580]  You suck.
[09:04.860 --> 09:06.720]  Twenty-five bucks, I could have got coffee.
[09:07.480 --> 09:09.860]  I really wanted coffee. I thought you were gonna go water.
[09:10.220 --> 09:12.060]  I thought it'd be so funny if I picked coffee.
[09:14.160 --> 09:15.340]  Oh, man. Fuck you.
[09:15.460 --> 09:16.260]  That really threw me.
[09:16.580 --> 09:17.300]  Have it every morning.
[09:17.660 --> 09:19.980]  Thanks to Eric, I'm trying it in the afternoons as well.
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.260]  Oh, how's that been going for you?
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.400]  Pretty good. Not keeping me up.
[09:23.980 --> 09:26.360]  Yeah, right? It's a nice little pick-me-up. It's not doing too much.
[09:26.400 --> 09:30.000]  You can also just add a little bit of water. Like, make it a little weaker. Have a little water. Half caffeine. You're good.
[09:30.220 --> 09:34.160]  If I make my morning coffee late enough, I just have the dregs of that in the afternoon.
[09:34.160 --> 09:36.160]  Oh, that sounds awful.
[09:37.160 --> 09:38.120]  It's not great.
[09:40.340 --> 09:43.420]  Yum. Andrew, your first pick.
[09:43.680 --> 09:46.120]  I'm gonna go with the number one soda in the world.
[09:46.200 --> 09:47.060]  I'm going Coca-Cola.
[09:47.400 --> 09:50.500]  It is a classic. Love it as a summer drink.
[09:50.720 --> 09:54.460]  Love it as a slurpee. You go sorts of ways with Coke.
[09:54.900 --> 09:56.240]  Number one brand leader.
[09:56.460 --> 09:59.040]  I think, hands down, best drink.
[09:59.620 --> 10:01.360]  Okay, pick.
[10:02.300 --> 10:02.700]  Nick.
[10:03.740 --> 10:09.440]  Alright, so this is as close as you can get to drip coffee and still consider it to be that.
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.500]  It's an Americano, which is basically like a shot of espresso, but filled with water to make up the difference.
[10:14.780 --> 10:16.120]  So it's... I feel like that's coffee.
[10:17.240 --> 10:20.340]  No. I'll let you guys argue about it. Go ahead.
[10:20.440 --> 10:22.320]  After the hash brown thing...
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.840]  Yeah, I'm cued. You're shredded. No, I'm shredded. You're cued.
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.020]  Hold on. It doesn't matter.
[10:29.020 --> 10:32.680]  I was going to say that I feel like it's coffee, but I don't know anything about coffee.
[10:33.160 --> 10:36.920]  So would Diet Coke be acceptable as Eric's pick if Anders picked Coke?
[10:37.120 --> 10:39.660]  Yeah, it's not the same thing. Yeah, I would be okay with Diet Coke.
[10:40.600 --> 10:44.380]  Yeah, they're different products entirely. Different flavor, different product entirely.
[10:44.780 --> 10:47.340]  Completely different, but close. But different.
[10:47.680 --> 10:50.200]  It's going to kill you in a totally different way. Yeah, exactly.
[10:51.160 --> 10:55.260]  So Americano. Well, Gavin already knew what my pick was.
[10:56.120 --> 10:57.300]  Diet Coke it is, baby.
[11:02.330 --> 11:05.470]  I feel... What? What do you mean?
[11:07.010 --> 11:10.350]  We got coffee. We got coffee, Coke, coffee, and Coke.
[11:10.550 --> 11:14.050]  What an excellent first round. Well, no, listen. You're not a beverages guy.
[11:14.130 --> 11:16.170]  There's a wild difference. I love Coca-Cola.
[11:16.630 --> 11:19.570]  I spit in the face of Diet Coke. I don't like it. Oh, yeah.
[11:19.690 --> 11:21.510]  Diet Coke's true. I'm with you. Get it out of here.
[11:21.550 --> 11:23.370]  I don't like Diet Coke at all.
[11:23.630 --> 11:26.150]  And I would never drink a Coke to save my life.
[11:26.150 --> 11:29.310]  I'd much rather have a Diet Coke. Oh, yeah, I think I think Diet Coke sucks.
[11:29.410 --> 11:31.730]  I don't like it at all. Did you do that despite Geoff?
[11:31.870 --> 11:36.190]  What are you doing? I'm trying to make the best, the strongest list in the world.
[11:37.230 --> 11:38.730]  He's here to win the Super Bowl.
[11:38.850 --> 11:42.510]  He doesn't necessarily have to like the pick. He's trying to build a winning team.
[11:43.170 --> 11:44.530]  Here's. Yeah, so it's my turn.
[11:44.910 --> 11:48.770]  Yeah. And here's where here's where I was going to go with it.
[11:48.790 --> 11:49.670]  And now I'm not.
[11:49.770 --> 11:54.890]  I was going to try to get coffee, iced coffee, cold brew and iced turbo
[11:54.890 --> 11:57.690]  because I consider them all four to be different things.
[11:58.130 --> 12:00.910]  But since that's blown and we're already doing the Americano stuff,
[12:01.050 --> 12:02.590]  I'm going to leave coffee alone.
[12:02.850 --> 12:09.270]  OK, I'm going to go with my current favorite Sodi in the world,
[12:09.330 --> 12:11.050]  which is Diet Starry.
[12:12.390 --> 12:13.890]  Wow, that's your favorite one right now?
[12:13.910 --> 12:16.630]  I like Starry right now. I like the little lemon lime dudes.
[12:16.730 --> 12:20.810]  I like how the lemon guy wears a lime costume and the lime guy wears a lemon costume.
[12:20.910 --> 12:22.490]  It fucks with my head a little bit. Yeah.
[12:22.510 --> 12:24.290]  And I love the story behind it.
[12:24.290 --> 12:29.930]  If you don't know about Starry and, you know, they just showed up one day advertising in NBA games.
[12:30.430 --> 12:31.450]  A brand came out of nowhere.
[12:31.870 --> 12:35.050]  What happened is they had is Pepsi, PepsiCo.
[12:35.170 --> 12:39.390]  They had Sierra Mist and then there was some fucking influencer lady named Sierra Mist
[12:39.390 --> 12:44.410]  and they tried to sue her to have her stop using the name, but she had the name first.
[12:44.750 --> 12:48.710]  So what ended up happening was they fucked themselves and lost access to their own name.
[12:48.830 --> 12:50.330]  And so they had to rename the Starry.
[12:50.530 --> 12:51.770]  Oh, that's what happened?
[12:52.270 --> 12:53.630]  That's why Starry exists.
[12:53.630 --> 12:55.370]  It's just Sierra Mist with a different name.
[12:55.870 --> 12:57.150]  I had no idea. Wow.
[12:57.250 --> 12:58.470]  I had no idea about that either.
[12:59.130 --> 13:01.950]  I wondered if it was a different recipe and I feel like you answered that.
[13:02.050 --> 13:03.810]  It is the exact same. It sounds like.
[13:04.290 --> 13:05.690]  Yeah, I think it's I think it's the exact same.
[13:05.830 --> 13:08.950]  And now I'm going to pick something that nobody is going to pick.
[13:09.050 --> 13:12.130]  I'm going to put a picture of it. So I get to go back to back. This is a weird one.
[13:12.410 --> 13:13.930]  I promise you I'm not being a dickhead.
[13:14.230 --> 13:18.130]  This is something that I genuinely liked. Vimto.
[13:18.560 --> 13:19.350]  What is that?
[13:20.250 --> 13:22.350]  It just ravaged my list.
[13:24.770 --> 13:27.770]  I didn't expect for a second to lose Vimto.
[13:28.330 --> 13:29.730]  Are you shitting me?
[13:30.790 --> 13:31.930]  Are you serious?
[13:32.990 --> 13:33.450]  Yeah.
[13:34.070 --> 13:35.490]  I love Vimto, man.
[13:36.610 --> 13:39.930]  It's like a fruit juice I used to drink in Kuwait all the time.
[13:40.070 --> 13:41.170]  They would always give it to us as a gift.
[13:41.790 --> 13:42.990]  God damn it.
[13:43.730 --> 13:44.810]  That's throwing me.
[13:44.990 --> 13:46.630]  I've never heard of Vimto.
[13:47.230 --> 13:50.990]  One time I dropped a bottle of Vimto in front of my door at the barracks in Kuwait.
[13:51.130 --> 13:52.010]  And I just left it.
[13:52.190 --> 13:54.830]  And they sent the MPs because they thought it was a blood trail.
[13:55.270 --> 13:56.550]  Oh my god.
[13:57.450 --> 13:58.610]  Oh my god.
[13:58.730 --> 14:00.110]  I had to explain some shit.
[14:00.730 --> 14:08.630]  Vimto is a British mixed fruit soft drink containing the juice of grapes, raspberries, and black currants.
[14:09.350 --> 14:10.790]  Flavored with herbs and spices.
[14:10.950 --> 14:11.690]  What does it taste like?
[14:11.870 --> 14:16.130]  Google says it's over 100 years old and has an indescribable flavor.
[14:16.130 --> 14:17.470]  Yeah, indescribable.
[14:17.670 --> 14:20.490]  It's like a syrupy dark fruit juice.
[14:20.630 --> 14:21.330]  I don't know how to describe it.
[14:22.090 --> 14:24.770]  It's like in the same world as grape juice, but very different.
[14:25.430 --> 14:25.750]  Huh.
[14:26.830 --> 14:27.250]  Interesting.
[14:27.890 --> 14:29.550]  Vimto, I like that you fucked up Gavin.
[14:29.810 --> 14:31.290]  I really didn't mean to.
[14:32.150 --> 14:34.210]  I didn't think anybody would have heard of it.
[14:34.850 --> 14:35.810]  That's what I thought.
[14:40.370 --> 14:41.730]  Okay, my second pick.
[14:41.810 --> 14:42.750]  My first pick, Diet Coke.
[14:43.350 --> 14:44.530]  What a delicious soda.
[14:45.590 --> 14:49.270]  My second pick, I drink black coffee.
[14:49.550 --> 14:52.690]  That is the only really form of coffee that I'll have.
[14:52.770 --> 14:54.390]  I'll have iced coffee, but usually it's just black.
[14:54.850 --> 15:00.750]  Except one time of year where I am a slut for a pumpkin spice latte.
[15:01.210 --> 15:04.730]  I love a pumpkin spice latte.
[15:05.210 --> 15:06.310]  This is bullshit.
[15:07.150 --> 15:08.250]  I love it.
[15:08.530 --> 15:11.970]  And it's so good and different from regular coffee.
[15:12.470 --> 15:14.830]  This is the shittiest drop we've ever done.
[15:15.050 --> 15:15.890]  Wow, what's wrong?
[15:16.230 --> 15:17.490]  I took coffee.
[15:18.070 --> 15:19.510]  No, you took Vimto.
[15:19.710 --> 15:21.410]  You took coffee and then my thing is different.
[15:21.530 --> 15:22.810]  It doesn't say coffee anywhere on there.
[15:23.050 --> 15:24.090]  It says pumpkin spice latte.
[15:24.430 --> 15:29.150]  If I went up to Starbucks and I said give me a coffee and they handed me a pumpkin spice latte.
[15:29.330 --> 15:30.030]  It's different things, bud.
[15:30.290 --> 15:34.110]  The problem, Gavin, is that I don't know enough about coffee to be on your side.
[15:34.190 --> 15:35.210]  I don't know what a latte is.
[15:35.290 --> 15:35.810]  I have no clue.
[15:36.010 --> 15:37.490]  It's made with fricking coffee beans.
[15:37.990 --> 15:40.070]  I think I'm on your side, but I just don't know.
[15:41.310 --> 15:42.070]  Geoff, thoughts?
[15:42.430 --> 15:44.830]  I think a pumpkin spice latte
[15:46.770 --> 15:47.130]  is
[15:47.130 --> 15:48.450]  not as offensive
[15:48.830 --> 15:50.730]  as a choice as Americano was.
[15:51.210 --> 15:51.710]  I think it's close.
[15:52.110 --> 15:53.070]  I think it's less controversial.
[15:53.330 --> 15:55.750]  See, what I've done by picking coffee, though, compared to everyone else
[15:55.750 --> 15:57.910]  is now I can't put like a cappuccino
[15:57.910 --> 15:58.950]  because I've already put coffee.
[15:59.830 --> 16:01.310]  Yeah, you can put cappuccino if you want.
[16:01.590 --> 16:02.210]  They're different.
[16:03.630 --> 16:05.210]  You just said it's a different name.
[16:05.270 --> 16:07.090]  You said I can't put cappuccino, but you can.
[16:07.690 --> 16:09.450]  I could have put that instead of coffee.
[16:10.510 --> 16:11.950]  I guess you should have done that.
[16:12.090 --> 16:13.850]  It just seemed weird that you picked coffee.
[16:14.230 --> 16:15.430]  Yeah, weird. I didn't think other people
[16:15.430 --> 16:16.890]  would also be picking coffee. Weird.
[16:18.150 --> 16:18.730]  Well, we didn't.
[16:19.690 --> 16:21.130]  Yeah, we picked pumpkin spice latte.
[16:21.970 --> 16:23.670]  I'm gonna watch you making
[16:23.670 --> 16:25.670]  an Americano and a pumpkin spice latte
[16:25.670 --> 16:27.350]  without using coffee. Let's see how that goes.
[16:27.390 --> 16:29.610]  Well, I'm gonna watch you make any drink without water,
[16:29.750 --> 16:30.030]  asshole.
[16:34.490 --> 16:35.010]  That's fair.
[16:36.430 --> 16:36.850]  Nick!
[16:37.750 --> 16:38.150]  Second pick.
[16:38.870 --> 16:41.130]  I'm so pissed at you. I was gonna say
[16:41.130 --> 16:43.330]  basic bitch my way through all of October
[16:43.330 --> 16:44.690]  with the pumpkin spice latte.
[16:45.090 --> 16:46.330]  I was saving that for this.
[16:46.610 --> 16:48.190]  Just to keep rolling.
[16:49.810 --> 16:50.610]  I'm gonna go with
[16:50.610 --> 16:52.770]  a wonderful...
[16:52.770 --> 16:55.590]  It's a variation of an Earl Grey tea
[16:55.590 --> 16:57.790]  spiced with vanilla and honey. It's called a London Fog.
[16:57.970 --> 16:59.630]  I like to get it with a shot of espresso.
[17:00.850 --> 17:01.610]  Wait, what?
[17:01.810 --> 17:03.370]  You get a London Fog with espresso?
[17:03.970 --> 17:04.250]  Yeah.
[17:08.760 --> 17:09.920]  You must be buzzing
[17:09.920 --> 17:10.520]  after that.
[17:10.740 --> 17:13.760]  You just fucking flying
[17:13.760 --> 17:14.400]  or what?
[17:14.680 --> 17:15.900]  London Fog doesn't have that much.
[17:17.960 --> 17:18.740]  It's good.
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.000]  Tune in for my next pick, an Arnold Palmer with coffee.
[17:26.100 --> 17:27.780]  In this bullshit draft.
[17:30.860 --> 17:32.480]  I'm so sorry, Gavin.
[17:35.340 --> 17:36.460]  Oh, man.
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.980]  That might be refreshing, actually.
[17:39.680 --> 17:41.800]  Hey, Andrew, you have your
[17:41.800 --> 17:42.360]  second pick.
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.920]  I mean, what's the worst that could happen
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.500]  when you're having a draft
[17:47.580 --> 17:49.220]  going with Dr. Pepper
[17:50.120 --> 17:51.040]  and the
[17:51.820 --> 17:52.200]  new
[17:53.780 --> 17:55.160]  number two soda?
[17:55.340 --> 17:57.500]  I took over Pepsi recently.
[17:58.420 --> 17:59.540]  I like it.
[17:59.760 --> 18:01.200]  The thing about Dr. Pepper,
[18:01.480 --> 18:03.120]  which is nice, unlike coffee,
[18:03.120 --> 18:04.800]  there isn't really a number two.
[18:04.960 --> 18:06.480]  There isn't a close second.
[18:06.680 --> 18:09.320]  It is its own flavor. Hard to duplicate.
[18:09.580 --> 18:10.960]  There are other brands that try,
[18:11.360 --> 18:13.720]  but I feel like there is a large gap.
[18:14.340 --> 18:15.040]  Like a Pibb?
[18:15.240 --> 18:17.200]  Yeah, I think there's a large quality gap
[18:17.540 --> 18:19.220]  between a Pibb to a Dr. Pepper.
[18:19.760 --> 18:20.800]  I'm going Dr. Pepper.
[18:21.240 --> 18:22.860]  You think Dr. Pepper is better than Mr. Pibb?
[18:23.360 --> 18:24.160]  Way better!
[18:25.120 --> 18:26.480]  Completely different league better.
[18:27.420 --> 18:27.840]  Interesting.
[18:28.360 --> 18:30.140]  So if I wanted to, could I pick Mr. Pibb?
[18:30.740 --> 18:31.840]  You could, absolutely.
[18:32.180 --> 18:33.040]  I'm just checking.
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.960]  It's a totally different drink.
[18:36.540 --> 18:38.000]  Like coffee and pumpkin spice latte.
[18:38.140 --> 18:39.240]  Gavin, your second pick?
[18:41.140 --> 18:42.500]  Other good liquids.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.240]  I like liquids that are hot.
[18:44.580 --> 18:45.520]  And I like them
[18:45.520 --> 18:47.640]  with essence of meat.
[18:47.920 --> 18:48.780]  It's Bovril.
[18:50.700 --> 18:51.820]  Hot Bovril.
[18:52.400 --> 18:54.560]  One of the worst drinks
[18:54.560 --> 18:55.220]  I've ever had.
[18:57.200 --> 18:58.740]  I had a feeling
[18:58.740 --> 19:01.180]  that it would rear its ugly, beefy head.
[19:01.320 --> 19:01.900]  And it does.
[19:03.860 --> 19:05.280]  Human sandwich guy
[19:05.280 --> 19:06.700]  picking beef juice.
[19:07.100 --> 19:07.800]  I'm not shocked.
[19:10.220 --> 19:11.420]  Well, Gavin, after
[19:12.020 --> 19:13.840]  your gross Bovril pick
[19:13.840 --> 19:15.480]  you actually get another pick
[19:15.480 --> 19:16.340]  in this snake draft.
[19:16.980 --> 19:18.000]  What's after Bovril?
[19:18.080 --> 19:21.300]  I would have actually accepted Bovril as best breakfast foods as well.
[19:21.620 --> 19:22.560]  I would have been okay with that one.
[19:22.560 --> 19:24.140]  See, that's the great thing about Bovril.
[19:24.960 --> 19:26.220]  I'll picture my next one.
[19:26.940 --> 19:27.420]  Lovely.
[19:29.120 --> 19:30.820]  This is maybe one of...
[19:31.320 --> 19:33.140]  This might have been the first fizzy drink
[19:33.140 --> 19:34.060]  I ever tried, which
[19:34.680 --> 19:36.680]  probably put me off them for the rest of my life.
[19:37.300 --> 19:38.520]  It's a nice can
[19:38.520 --> 19:39.560]  of Lilt.
[19:40.500 --> 19:41.520]  What is Lilt?
[19:43.160 --> 19:44.820]  Pineapple and grapefruit Lilt.
[19:44.880 --> 19:46.240]  Get a bit of Lilt down ya.
[19:47.780 --> 19:48.900]  I don't like
[19:48.900 --> 19:50.500]  when you... You got more British
[19:50.500 --> 19:52.680]  when you said it. It was like a lot.
[19:53.320 --> 19:54.700]  So you didn't like the Lilt?
[19:54.700 --> 19:55.720]  Is that what you're saying?
[19:56.860 --> 19:58.640]  As a kid I didn't like anything fizzy.
[19:58.780 --> 20:00.120]  But I think the flavor was fine.
[20:00.740 --> 20:03.560]  I think I found like a stale
[20:05.040 --> 20:05.940]  still can
[20:05.940 --> 20:06.880]  of Lilt pretty good.
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.100]  But I think
[20:09.100 --> 20:10.680]  they got rid of it eventually.
[20:11.540 --> 20:12.960]  What a trajectory
[20:12.960 --> 20:14.920]  your life has been of hating
[20:14.920 --> 20:16.880]  anything fizzy to becoming a soda
[20:16.880 --> 20:17.640]  stream guy.
[20:20.180 --> 20:21.080]  You're adding
[20:21.080 --> 20:21.860]  fizz now.
[20:22.460 --> 20:24.500]  It says right here that Lilt
[20:24.500 --> 20:26.520]  was discontinued in the
[20:26.520 --> 20:28.660]  early 2000's because it caused extreme
[20:28.660 --> 20:30.320]  stupidity in British boys.
[20:32.300 --> 20:32.460]  Yeah
[20:32.460 --> 20:34.480]  Lilt fizzy drink scrapped by Coca Cola
[20:34.480 --> 20:35.800]  after 50 years.
[20:36.760 --> 20:38.440]  1974 to 2023.
[20:39.440 --> 20:40.240]  Man, Rip Lilt.
[20:41.000 --> 20:41.580]  Good run.
[20:42.360 --> 20:44.840]  Some great adverts. Rip Lilt's a cool name.
[20:46.780 --> 20:48.760]  I'm with you though. When I was a kid
[20:48.760 --> 20:50.600]  I did not like fizzy drinks at all.
[20:50.600 --> 20:53.280]  I didn't drink soda at all. None of it.
[20:53.400 --> 20:54.400]  Just not for me.
[20:55.040 --> 20:55.400]  Interesting.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.720]  Andrew, you get your third pick.
[20:58.820 --> 21:00.080]  So far you have Coca Cola and Dr Pepper.
[21:00.300 --> 21:02.640]  What do you have as your third pick on the list?
[21:05.480 --> 21:06.640]  This is completely
[21:06.640 --> 21:08.420]  thrown me. I did not expect Lilt
[21:08.420 --> 21:10.420]  to be on the board in the third round.
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.560]  What do I want to pick?
[21:13.940 --> 21:17.060]  You say that like Gavin stole your Lilt.
[21:17.680 --> 21:18.320]  No, I just
[21:18.320 --> 21:20.880]  I didn't
[21:20.880 --> 21:23.180]  This board is crazy compared to what I had.
[21:23.380 --> 21:25.400]  I'm just processing. I'm looking at my own field.
[21:25.640 --> 21:27.100]  Has any board ever
[21:27.100 --> 21:28.240]  gone the way you thought it would?
[21:28.720 --> 21:30.760]  Yeah, the TV one.
[21:31.180 --> 21:32.880]  I had a lot of picks taken in that one.
[21:34.820 --> 21:35.800]  I'm going to go with
[21:36.400 --> 21:39.160]  I don't think there's necessarily a wrong answer to this
[21:39.940 --> 21:40.380]  but
[21:40.880 --> 21:42.240]  classic Mountain Dew flavor
[21:42.800 --> 21:43.680]  Mountain Dew Code Red.
[21:45.560 --> 21:46.820]  I think that's probably
[21:47.780 --> 21:49.500]  It's the only acceptable
[21:49.500 --> 21:51.420]  Mountain Dew. I agree. Really?
[21:51.920 --> 21:52.840]  I can't drink Mountain Dew.
[21:53.740 --> 21:55.080]  I like a Baja Blast
[21:55.080 --> 21:56.840]  Oh, Baja Blast, okay.
[21:57.700 --> 21:58.920]  I like quite a few of them
[21:58.920 --> 22:01.260]  but I had to go with Code Red.
[22:01.480 --> 22:02.340]  It was a tough decision.
[22:03.220 --> 22:05.180]  There's a lot of good choices for Mountain Dew.
[22:05.760 --> 22:06.940]  I wish I had a fun fact about it.
[22:07.580 --> 22:09.660]  I don't believe Coke killed it is my fun fact.
[22:10.360 --> 22:10.980]  Unlike Lilt.
[22:14.880 --> 22:16.720]  Mountain Dew fun facts.
[22:16.840 --> 22:18.440]  Eleven energizing facts
[22:18.440 --> 22:20.300]  about Mountain Dew.
[22:20.960 --> 22:21.740]  Did you know
[22:21.740 --> 22:22.840]  that the Great Depression
[22:22.840 --> 22:24.200]  made Mountain Dew possible?
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.460]  Hell yeah, Code Red.
[22:26.700 --> 22:28.160]  That's what they refer to it as.
[22:30.040 --> 22:31.100]  They wanted to be
[22:31.100 --> 22:32.340]  the dudes that made it
[22:32.340 --> 22:34.200]  wanted to be orange soda moguls
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.560]  but they were part of a group
[22:35.560 --> 22:37.120]  that began bottling orange crush
[22:37.120 --> 22:38.260]  in 1926
[22:38.860 --> 22:41.020]  but then the Depression hit
[22:41.020 --> 22:43.020]  them particularly hard
[22:43.020 --> 22:43.880]  so they went bankrupt
[22:43.880 --> 22:46.060]  and had to pivot. Interesting.
[22:46.540 --> 22:46.640]  Huh.
[22:47.800 --> 22:49.500]  Isn't Mountain Dew made to be
[22:50.360 --> 22:51.680]  put with whiskey?
[22:51.920 --> 22:53.640]  I think it was made
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.960]  with hillbilly syrup, right?
[22:57.240 --> 22:58.880]  Yeah, I was going to say
[22:58.880 --> 23:00.800]  yesterday I was in my
[23:00.800 --> 23:02.440]  orange factory, today
[23:02.440 --> 23:04.880]  I'm making dew in the fucking mountains.
[23:05.260 --> 23:06.400]  Life's terrible.
[23:09.670 --> 23:10.630]  Pepsi eventually
[23:10.630 --> 23:11.930]  retired the hillbilly
[23:11.930 --> 23:13.470]  they were the mascots.
[23:15.130 --> 23:16.090]  RIP hillbilly.
[23:16.490 --> 23:18.390]  Can we do like a soda graveyard
[23:18.390 --> 23:19.510]  of lil' tid
[23:19.510 --> 23:21.950]  the hillbilly from Mountain Dew?
[23:22.350 --> 23:23.890]  Like cancelled fruit drinks?
[23:24.770 --> 23:25.230]  I mean sodas?
[23:25.850 --> 23:27.070]  Cancelled soda people.
[23:27.890 --> 23:29.550]  Should we create a soda cemetery?
[23:29.870 --> 23:30.790]  I like this idea.
[23:32.450 --> 23:33.930]  Anyway, I had an idea I was telling Andrew
[23:33.930 --> 23:36.250]  earlier today. I had an idea for a graveyard game
[23:36.250 --> 23:38.050]  like when we play Cemetery Bingo
[23:38.650 --> 23:40.870]  and maybe we should start
[23:40.870 --> 23:42.250]  making virtual cemeteries
[23:42.250 --> 23:44.010]  for stuff like this.
[23:44.230 --> 23:46.970]  Good idea. Not a bad one.
[23:49.390 --> 23:51.170]  Nick, you have the third pick here.
[23:52.610 --> 23:53.710]  Well, it is the summer
[23:54.630 --> 23:56.470]  and there are certain drinks
[23:56.470 --> 23:57.870]  that stick out to us, I think
[23:58.850 --> 24:00.510]  when you're hot and you come in
[24:00.510 --> 24:02.970]  from like, let's say, Mowin' Your Lawn.
[24:03.730 --> 24:04.950]  This motherfucker's about to pick
[24:04.950 --> 24:05.670]  a nice coffee.
[24:07.510 --> 24:09.130]  I want to live, Andrew.
[24:09.290 --> 24:11.330]  I'm not picking a nice coffee in this instance.
[24:11.730 --> 24:13.230]  So you come in and you pour yourself
[24:13.230 --> 24:15.110]  a nice glass of lemonade
[24:15.790 --> 24:17.310]  or you're driving down the street
[24:17.310 --> 24:19.050]  and you see some kids at a stand
[24:19.050 --> 24:21.870]  and you're like, you know what? I have $2 cash.
[24:22.010 --> 24:22.650]  Here you go, kids.
[24:23.210 --> 24:24.530]  Is that a real thing?
[24:25.130 --> 24:27.110]  Yeah. Lemonade stands?
[24:27.830 --> 24:29.350]  Do they not exist in England?
[24:29.910 --> 24:30.990]  I don't know. I've never seen one.
[24:31.330 --> 24:32.890]  I would go so far as to say
[24:33.350 --> 24:33.530]  almost
[24:35.430 --> 24:36.670]  every kid in America
[24:37.070 --> 24:39.370]  has had a lemonade stand at one point in their life.
[24:39.510 --> 24:39.810]  Absolutely.
[24:40.550 --> 24:42.550]  I've had multiple as a kid. Me too.
[24:43.070 --> 24:44.890]  We should all go out and see who can make the most money.
[24:47.270 --> 24:48.070]  We should just have
[24:48.070 --> 24:49.430]  a lemonade stand, all of us together
[24:49.430 --> 24:50.490]  and see how it goes.
[24:51.570 --> 24:52.810]  That'd be a great supplement.
[24:52.950 --> 24:53.810]  That'd be a bunch of fun.
[24:56.550 --> 24:57.270]  What a
[24:57.910 --> 24:59.190]  fantastic idea for a supplement.
[24:59.570 --> 25:00.190]  I think we should do it.
[25:01.870 --> 25:02.750]  Regulation Lemonade!
[25:02.830 --> 25:03.970]  Oh, that's amazing.
[25:04.150 --> 25:05.110]  Yeah, that's perfect.
[25:06.450 --> 25:07.650]  This is my court.
[25:08.510 --> 25:10.550]  There's always money in the lemonade stand.
[25:11.050 --> 25:11.410]  That's true.
[25:13.110 --> 25:14.730]  I really want this now.
[25:15.170 --> 25:15.970]  That would be hilarious.
[25:17.090 --> 25:18.310]  I've got the next pick here.
[25:18.630 --> 25:20.750]  After Diet Coke and Pumpkin Spice Latte
[25:20.750 --> 25:22.670]  I'm going to cool down. I don't know if you guys know this.
[25:22.710 --> 25:23.650]  I'm from Southern California
[25:25.710 --> 25:26.970]  and my drink
[25:26.970 --> 25:28.830]  of choice at the taco shop
[25:28.830 --> 25:29.890]  is the Horchata.
[25:31.110 --> 25:32.230]  What's a Horchata?
[25:32.470 --> 25:33.650]  It's probably too white for Geoff.
[25:35.150 --> 25:36.570]  It's like a rice milk
[25:36.570 --> 25:37.430]  with a cinnamon
[25:40.290 --> 25:41.290]  sweet flavor
[25:41.290 --> 25:41.810]  to it.
[25:42.010 --> 25:43.650]  It's so good.
[25:45.730 --> 25:46.570]  I love a Horchata.
[25:46.730 --> 25:48.070]  Like an ice cold Horchata.
[25:48.570 --> 25:50.970]  When you're done skateboarding
[25:50.970 --> 25:52.030]  with your dumbass friends
[25:52.030 --> 25:54.670]  and you all split money for a burrito
[25:54.670 --> 25:55.910]  and then everyone gets a Horchata
[25:55.910 --> 25:58.270]  it rocks. It is such a good drink.
[25:58.550 --> 25:58.910]  I love it.
[26:00.050 --> 26:01.070]  I recommend it.
[26:01.910 --> 26:04.230]  It looks very appealing.
[26:05.370 --> 26:06.310]  It looks like
[26:06.310 --> 26:08.210]  it's not like milk
[26:08.210 --> 26:09.310]  it's not like
[26:10.110 --> 26:10.930]  rice milk.
[26:12.550 --> 26:13.930]  You're not a fan of this Geoff
[26:13.930 --> 26:14.570]  because it's white.
[26:16.610 --> 26:17.510]  Horchata's not my thing.
[26:19.850 --> 26:20.750]  It's very popular
[26:21.050 --> 26:21.750]  around here.
[26:21.930 --> 26:22.450]  People love it.
[26:22.450 --> 26:23.370]  It's not for me.
[26:24.870 --> 26:26.770]  But Geoff, you get your last two picks here.
[26:27.170 --> 26:28.910]  After your Diet Starry and Vimto.
[26:29.270 --> 26:30.750]  Oh boy, let's see.
[26:30.850 --> 26:31.890]  What am I going to pick?
[26:32.050 --> 26:33.610]  Let's go to the master list.
[26:34.870 --> 26:36.350]  Okay, for my third pick
[26:36.350 --> 26:37.090]  I'm going to pick
[26:37.090 --> 26:40.290]  a Root 44
[26:41.870 --> 26:42.370]  Diet
[26:43.050 --> 26:44.050]  Cherry Limeade
[26:45.250 --> 26:46.250]  from Sonic.
[26:49.010 --> 26:50.890]  I watched Gavin throw
[26:50.890 --> 26:52.530]  one time across his yard.
[26:53.030 --> 26:53.350]  What?
[26:55.750 --> 26:57.090]  We covered this on the show.
[26:57.310 --> 26:58.310]  Yeah, we covered it on F*** Face.
[26:58.670 --> 27:00.870]  We took him to get Root 44 Diet Cherry Limeade
[27:00.870 --> 27:03.210]  and when he got out of his car he f***ing chunked it across the house
[27:03.210 --> 27:04.110]  and I was laughing at him.
[27:04.590 --> 27:05.590]  I was holding it by the lid.
[27:06.470 --> 27:07.710]  It got away from me.
[27:09.150 --> 27:11.390]  And then, just because I can't
[27:12.470 --> 27:13.110]  Oh f***
[27:13.670 --> 27:14.510]  You know what, f*** it.
[27:15.070 --> 27:15.750]  I'm from Alabama.
[27:16.810 --> 27:17.390]  Sweet Tea.
[27:18.290 --> 27:18.770]  Oh!
[27:19.550 --> 27:21.170]  That's what I thought you were going for.
[27:21.590 --> 27:23.870]  I was thinking about
[27:23.870 --> 27:26.030]  Grapefruit Juice, but I'm going to go with
[27:26.030 --> 27:26.370]  Sweet Tea.
[27:27.090 --> 27:29.970]  I thought you were maybe considering Big Red.
[27:30.790 --> 27:32.270]  I forgot all about Big Red.
[27:32.990 --> 27:34.050]  Big Red is a great
[27:34.050 --> 27:35.930]  drink once every two years.
[27:36.890 --> 27:37.370]  Yeah.
[27:38.830 --> 27:40.310]  I've had Big Red
[27:40.310 --> 27:42.010]  once in my life. It was when I visited
[27:42.010 --> 27:43.870]  Austin and I got sick and I didn't know
[27:43.870 --> 27:44.770]  I was sick yet.
[27:45.120 --> 27:46.890]  And I came back from RTX
[27:46.890 --> 27:48.950]  and I had drank Big Red at lunch
[27:48.950 --> 27:51.370]  and I vomited the reddest
[27:51.370 --> 27:53.590]  maybe the second reddest puke.
[27:53.910 --> 27:54.390]  Just
[27:55.330 --> 27:57.410]  Big Red everywhere.
[27:58.450 --> 27:59.070]  Projectile
[27:59.070 --> 28:00.670]  horror movie blood vomit.
[28:01.230 --> 28:03.110]  And it kind of killed Big Red for me.
[28:03.290 --> 28:05.430]  Do you think we could be the first group of five
[28:05.430 --> 28:06.410]  to chunk the rainbow?
[28:07.310 --> 28:08.370]  Ha ha ha!
[28:09.150 --> 28:10.530]  Oh! Wow!
[28:11.350 --> 28:11.970]  Simultaneously?
[28:12.390 --> 28:13.770]  Or just...
[28:14.630 --> 28:16.430]  You do Big Red
[28:17.170 --> 28:18.050]  Orange Juice
[28:19.690 --> 28:20.270]  Grape Crush
[28:20.270 --> 28:21.010]  Lemonade
[28:22.370 --> 28:24.070]  What would you do with the last two?
[28:24.230 --> 28:26.010]  You want blue and green?
[28:26.290 --> 28:27.550]  Or do you want to get a purple in there?
[28:29.090 --> 28:30.550]  Purple would be Grape Crush
[28:30.550 --> 28:31.950]  Blue, there's a Mountain Dew
[28:32.370 --> 28:32.590]  Vimto
[28:33.730 --> 28:35.190]  You could have some Vimto
[28:35.190 --> 28:36.570]  Vimto would be great for Purple
[28:36.570 --> 28:37.230]  Some Ribena
[28:37.230 --> 28:39.990]  Yeah, and then we just all
[28:39.990 --> 28:41.790]  vomit on a Leprechaun
[28:41.790 --> 28:42.570]  or something
[28:43.210 --> 28:45.070]  So we just eat green?
[28:45.410 --> 28:46.470]  What's a green drink?
[28:47.600 --> 28:48.010]  Mountain Dew?
[28:48.790 --> 28:50.110]  Oh, Mountain Dew works
[28:50.110 --> 28:53.710]  Is it green or is the bottle green?
[28:54.270 --> 28:55.370]  If you pour out a Mountain Dew
[28:55.370 --> 28:56.110]  is it clear?
[28:56.610 --> 28:59.190]  I don't think it's clear
[28:59.190 --> 29:00.790]  There's Green Hawaiian Punch
[29:00.790 --> 29:02.450]  There's Green Gatorade
[29:03.550 --> 29:04.510]  There's a lot of green
[29:05.710 --> 29:06.930]  So why are we vomiting
[29:06.930 --> 29:09.230]  on a Leprechaun, Gavin? Why not into like a pot?
[29:10.110 --> 29:11.070]  Oh, is it the pot at the end?
[29:11.590 --> 29:11.850]  Yeah
[29:12.650 --> 29:13.370]  The Leprechaun
[29:15.350 --> 29:17.030]  Why do I throw? I want to throw up
[29:17.030 --> 29:18.550]  on a Leprechaun, I think that'd be way more fun
[29:18.550 --> 29:20.610]  Yeah, and then the gold's not, you know
[29:20.610 --> 29:22.130]  all messed up
[29:22.130 --> 29:25.610]  Whoever comes in last place has to be the Leprechaun
[29:26.310 --> 29:26.670]  Five
[29:27.710 --> 29:28.430]  Patreon vote
[29:30.490 --> 29:31.170]  Loser prize
[29:31.170 --> 29:32.390]  for F*** Face Off Season 2
[29:32.850 --> 29:35.190]  How did we go from starting a lemonade stand
[29:35.190 --> 29:36.930]  to having one of us get thrown up on by
[29:36.930 --> 29:37.690]  everybody else?
[29:38.910 --> 29:40.170]  It happened very quickly
[29:40.170 --> 29:42.570]  What do you mean because of me? It's because of you
[29:42.570 --> 29:43.830]  You threw up some big red
[29:44.310 --> 29:47.350]  Yeah, but you led it to puking a Leprechaun
[29:47.350 --> 29:48.770]  You led it to puking
[29:48.770 --> 29:50.230]  and I took it from there
[29:50.230 --> 29:53.030]  Okay, I think you're more the cause
[29:53.030 --> 29:54.530]  but I see where you're coming from
[29:54.530 --> 29:56.190]  I brought us to Puke Town
[29:56.190 --> 29:58.950]  You parked us in Leprechaun Alley
[30:00.170 --> 30:01.630]  Well, why don't you
[30:01.630 --> 30:02.870]  take us home with your fourth one?
[30:02.870 --> 30:05.290]  Well, if you insist. If we're talking about puking
[30:05.290 --> 30:07.410]  here's a drink that probably would make
[30:07.410 --> 30:09.730]  Geoff puke. I don't know, but I assume Eggnog
[30:09.730 --> 30:10.890]  is my number four
[30:11.490 --> 30:11.710]  God!
[30:13.490 --> 30:15.090]  I'd rather die
[30:15.090 --> 30:17.550]  I love Eggnog. Are you actually trying to win?
[30:18.590 --> 30:19.510]  Yeah, these are
[30:19.510 --> 30:21.130]  my picks. Not anymore, I don't think
[30:21.690 --> 30:23.190]  What do you mean? These are great picks
[30:23.190 --> 30:25.310]  He's gonna win a lot of people over with
[30:25.310 --> 30:27.150]  Diet Coke and Pumpkin Spice Latte
[30:28.130 --> 30:29.650]  You guys don't like Eggnog?
[30:30.330 --> 30:31.730]  No. You're not Noggin over here?
[30:32.410 --> 30:33.270]  I'm not Noggin
[30:33.270 --> 30:34.150]  I'm not a fan of the Nog
[30:34.150 --> 30:36.950]  And it's really the Egg's fault, once again
[30:37.560 --> 30:39.610]  The Egg thing really throws me
[30:40.490 --> 30:41.690]  I don't think there's any Egg
[30:41.690 --> 30:43.130]  in Eggnog, is there?
[30:43.850 --> 30:44.890]  Then why is Egg there?
[30:45.370 --> 30:46.730]  I think so
[30:47.390 --> 30:48.930]  I think you can make him an Eggnog
[30:48.930 --> 30:50.550]  I'm pretty sure you can make it
[30:50.550 --> 30:53.070]  Yeah, see, what if we did an An Eggnog?
[30:54.570 --> 30:55.830]  I'm kinda on board now
[30:55.830 --> 30:58.050]  If we get Gracie back and hire someone
[30:58.050 --> 30:59.490]  two people starting with N and O
[31:00.870 --> 31:02.090]  There's definitely Eggs
[31:02.090 --> 31:04.850]  Yeah, there's Eggs, Cream, Sugar, Milk
[31:04.850 --> 31:06.610]  First ingredient, six
[31:06.610 --> 31:07.610]  large Egg yolks
[31:07.610 --> 31:09.270]  You can just do it without
[31:10.530 --> 31:11.370]  the Eggs
[31:11.370 --> 31:12.770]  That's a lot of Egg
[31:13.850 --> 31:16.170]  I wonder why they don't serve this in the summer
[31:17.150 --> 31:18.630]  Why would you drink it in the summer?
[31:18.730 --> 31:20.330]  That's insane, this is a Christmas drink
[31:20.330 --> 31:22.710]  You're wearing a sweater, you're drinking that
[31:22.710 --> 31:23.570]  Ooh, it's good
[31:24.070 --> 31:25.350]  That's good stuff right there, baby
[31:27.450 --> 31:30.510]  But now, it's time for Nick's final pick
[31:30.510 --> 31:32.790]  I still wanna know what the Nog is
[31:32.790 --> 31:33.710]  We know what the Egg is
[31:33.710 --> 31:35.090]  Where does the Nog come in?
[31:35.510 --> 31:37.630]  Dude, this is even worse, I'm reading Wikipedia
[31:37.990 --> 31:39.310]  And this is how they describe it
[31:39.310 --> 31:40.370]  This is so gross
[31:41.930 --> 31:44.010]  Eggnog, historically also known as
[31:44.010 --> 31:45.150]  Milk Punch
[31:45.150 --> 31:47.110]  Or Egg Milk Punch
[31:47.830 --> 31:49.230]  I see why they changed the name
[31:49.230 --> 31:50.750]  Fucking Milk Punch
[31:52.170 --> 31:54.010]  Shoot me in the head
[31:54.010 --> 31:54.430]  There you go
[31:54.430 --> 31:55.810]  Jesus Christ
[31:57.270 --> 31:58.670]  That's just kryptonite
[31:59.190 --> 32:01.510]  Well, again, another drink
[32:01.510 --> 32:02.790]  When you come in from the heat
[32:02.790 --> 32:03.950]  And you wanna take a break
[32:03.950 --> 32:06.730]  But yeah, definitely an Eggnog, you put it on extra
[32:06.730 --> 32:08.150]  But if you want a little kick
[32:08.950 --> 32:11.430]  Still of some
[32:12.390 --> 32:12.950]  Caffeine
[32:13.570 --> 32:14.130]  Frappuccino
[32:15.150 --> 32:16.270]  Yeah, Frappuccino
[32:16.270 --> 32:19.330]  You get yourself a nice lemonade with a sweet tea
[32:19.330 --> 32:21.070]  And you make an Arnold Palmer
[32:21.070 --> 32:22.610]  And I'm going with the Arnold Palmer
[32:22.610 --> 32:24.450]  Because it's the best of both worlds
[32:24.450 --> 32:26.810]  You get the sweet, you get the cooling effect
[32:26.810 --> 32:30.050]  And you get a little bit of that energy from the caffeine
[32:30.050 --> 32:31.930]  So you've got coffee
[32:31.930 --> 32:33.610]  Tea with coffee
[32:35.130 --> 32:35.650]  Lemonade
[32:35.650 --> 32:36.910]  Tea with lemonade
[32:39.010 --> 32:40.050]  They're all different
[32:43.670 --> 32:45.530]  Put it that way Gavin
[32:45.530 --> 32:46.490]  Put it that way
[32:46.490 --> 32:48.950]  When Geoff has sweet tea, it's awesome
[32:48.950 --> 32:50.590]  It makes it so much funnier
[32:50.590 --> 32:53.910]  Gavin has coffee
[32:53.910 --> 32:55.690]  Geoff has sweet tea
[32:55.690 --> 32:56.930]  Nick has coffee
[32:56.930 --> 32:58.190]  And sweet tea
[33:01.310 --> 33:03.010]  Juice is an option
[33:03.010 --> 33:05.130]  There's so many drinks
[33:05.130 --> 33:06.490]  There's so many drinks
[33:07.090 --> 33:09.990]  I also, nobody picked a white monster
[33:09.990 --> 33:11.430]  Which surprised me
[33:11.430 --> 33:13.490]  But we're not day laborers
[33:13.490 --> 33:15.270]  So I just assumed no one would pick that
[33:15.710 --> 33:18.810]  Yeah, but it's probably what I drink more than anything else
[33:18.810 --> 33:20.530]  Oh god
[33:23.150 --> 33:24.470]  Well, next up is Andrew
[33:25.590 --> 33:28.110]  Andrew, before you give us your final pick
[33:34.190 --> 33:35.850]  Andrew, before you give us your final pick
[33:37.790 --> 33:39.810]  How many things are not
[33:39.810 --> 33:41.730]  Like how many items
[33:41.730 --> 33:43.290]  Do you have listed that you aren't going to be picking
[33:45.970 --> 33:47.090]  Oh, let's see
[33:47.090 --> 33:48.330]  Let me pull up my list
[33:48.330 --> 33:51.210]  I have 21 drinks
[33:51.210 --> 33:52.790]  Oh my god
[33:52.790 --> 33:56.410]  I don't think I could name 21 drinks
[33:56.410 --> 33:57.050]  Nope
[33:57.050 --> 33:59.590]  Well I could, coffee, americano
[33:59.590 --> 34:00.950]  Pumpkin spice latte
[34:01.870 --> 34:03.050]  Arnold Palmer
[34:03.050 --> 34:03.990]  Shirley Temple
[34:04.950 --> 34:07.670]  Should I run down Marilyn Monroe
[34:07.670 --> 34:09.470]  You don't have to give them all
[34:09.470 --> 34:10.610]  I just wanted to know
[34:10.610 --> 34:12.870]  Because I felt like you came in way over prepared
[34:13.490 --> 34:15.490]  Against me, a guy who listed water first
[34:15.490 --> 34:16.630]  And then didn't pick me
[34:17.630 --> 34:18.490]  I'm going to be honest
[34:18.490 --> 34:21.590]  I considered water, but I really didn't want to get
[34:21.590 --> 34:24.410]  Fuck like Gavin to have somebody come in with sparkling water
[34:24.410 --> 34:25.830]  And get completely undercut
[34:25.830 --> 34:27.750]  It felt like a trap
[34:27.750 --> 34:28.770]  Yeah, that's lame
[34:31.230 --> 34:32.590]  Oh man, what do I pick
[34:32.590 --> 34:34.230]  I have so many things to choose from
[34:35.390 --> 34:36.850]  I think I'll round out
[34:36.850 --> 34:39.670]  I have a soda theme, so I think I'll stick with soda
[34:40.290 --> 34:41.510]  I like a root beer
[34:41.980 --> 34:44.190]  And I think the number one root beer is Barks Root Beer
[34:44.790 --> 34:46.890]  I'm going to close out my bubble
[34:47.570 --> 34:48.430]  Barks Root Beer
[34:48.430 --> 34:50.390]  I almost picked Root Beer
[34:50.390 --> 34:53.010]  I like an IBC myself, but Barks is really good too
[34:53.010 --> 34:55.470]  IBC? Okay, I don't know if I've had that one
[34:55.970 --> 34:56.930]  IBC Root Beer
[34:57.790 --> 34:58.550]  It's good
[34:58.550 --> 35:01.690]  Is it like a known wide brand in America
[35:01.690 --> 35:02.950]  Or is it like a
[35:02.950 --> 35:03.810]  Yeah
[35:03.810 --> 35:06.070]  Yeah, IBC, it's big
[35:07.350 --> 35:07.830]  Interesting
[35:07.830 --> 35:09.570]  You can get it anywhere in America
[35:09.570 --> 35:11.650]  It comes in a bottle
[35:13.130 --> 35:15.350]  Currently unavailable on Amazon.ca
[35:15.350 --> 35:17.130]  I'll see if I can get this somehow
[35:17.130 --> 35:18.650]  Oh, I'm sorry dude
[35:18.650 --> 35:19.330]  Interesting
[35:20.990 --> 35:22.290]  You know what I should have picked
[35:22.290 --> 35:24.590]  If I really wanted Gavin's heart
[35:24.590 --> 35:25.770]  Is Dad's Root Beer
[35:25.770 --> 35:27.150]  I don't know if
[35:28.010 --> 35:30.070]  That's a thing that is just Canadian only
[35:30.070 --> 35:32.350]  But everyone brings a dad back into this
[35:32.350 --> 35:33.850]  They actually sell it in Austin
[35:33.850 --> 35:35.410]  Really? Okay
[35:36.370 --> 35:38.270]  Dad's just a root beer bottle
[35:38.270 --> 35:40.430]  That says Dad's felt Canadian to me
[35:40.870 --> 35:42.650]  It probably is
[35:42.650 --> 35:44.470]  I used to get it at Costco
[35:45.290 --> 35:46.690]  Dad's Root Beer
[35:46.690 --> 35:48.170]  I think I saw it at Big Lots
[35:48.790 --> 35:51.150]  I used to get it at Costco
[35:51.150 --> 35:53.050]  When Costco was Price Club
[35:54.610 --> 35:56.090]  Holy shit dude
[35:56.090 --> 35:56.850]  Yeah
[35:56.850 --> 35:58.890]  I don't remember that at all
[35:58.890 --> 36:00.670]  Is anybody drinking any
[36:00.670 --> 36:03.390]  Is anybody actually drinking anything right now
[36:03.390 --> 36:05.070]  I am drinking
[36:05.070 --> 36:06.970]  Something related to a draft
[36:06.970 --> 36:08.570]  That we're not going to end up recording today
[36:11.730 --> 36:16.610]  I just realized I'm drinking a bang purple haze energy drink which did not get mentioned.
[36:16.670 --> 36:21.570]  As soon as we're done here, I'm going to go make a cup of the very first pick on this
[36:21.570 --> 36:22.010]  whole draft.
[36:22.910 --> 36:24.430]  But nothing right now.
[36:24.730 --> 36:26.310]  I was thinking about going with the number three.
[36:30.450 --> 36:31.770]  See how they're different, Gavin?
[36:31.830 --> 36:32.710]  Yeah, they're different, Gavin.
[36:33.250 --> 36:33.990]  No, totally different.
[36:39.910 --> 36:43.810]  If Gavin were to put that up for a vote, Geoff, would you have voted against the Americana?
[36:46.900 --> 36:48.460]  I would have voted no to it.
[36:49.860 --> 36:51.260]  So it just comes down to you.
[36:53.080 --> 36:55.700]  Yeah, I probably would have voted no.
[36:55.980 --> 36:58.480]  That is your fault, Gavin, that you didn't receive the vote.
[36:58.680 --> 36:59.780]  That's too bad we waited.
[37:00.120 --> 37:00.660]  Oh, sorry.
[37:01.140 --> 37:04.820]  Because now that I think about it, I mean, materially it's the same thing.
[37:04.820 --> 37:08.680]  You're not even really adding any different ingredients into it, it's just a preparation
[37:08.680 --> 37:09.220]  deal.
[37:09.380 --> 37:10.620]  Yeah, I don't think so.
[37:10.940 --> 37:13.240]  And honestly, hey, Gavin, apology accepted.
[37:13.400 --> 37:13.580]  Yeah.
[37:13.720 --> 37:14.180]  You know what?
[37:16.400 --> 37:18.760]  Yeah, I think you got to fight for yourself a little bit harder, Gavin.
[37:18.760 --> 37:20.580]  I would have been in your corner now that I think about it.
[37:20.640 --> 37:21.460]  Yeah, Gavin, I'm over it.
[37:21.480 --> 37:21.840]  Thanks, man.
[37:23.140 --> 37:23.660]  Hey, no worries.
[37:23.760 --> 37:24.900]  Let's just move past it, yeah?
[37:25.680 --> 37:28.920]  Oh, we should move past it to the very last pick of this draft, Gavin, go ahead.
[37:29.500 --> 37:33.120]  Oh, we got Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Mexican Coke.
[37:33.700 --> 37:35.760]  Mexican Coke was on my list!
[37:36.300 --> 37:36.860]  That's a good one.
[37:36.880 --> 37:37.320]  I had a Doritos.
[37:37.380 --> 37:39.800]  So nobody picked water.
[37:40.400 --> 37:42.480]  That's so fucking funny to me.
[37:46.620 --> 37:47.920]  What is Mexican Coke?
[37:48.020 --> 37:49.340]  It's just like sugar Coke.
[37:49.580 --> 37:50.900]  Yeah, yeah, they make it with sugar.
[37:51.340 --> 37:52.960]  With cane sugar, I think, instead of...
[37:52.960 --> 37:53.700]  Made with cane sugar, yeah.
[37:54.060 --> 37:54.280]  Yeah.
[37:54.700 --> 37:55.400]  Served in a glass bottle.
[37:55.400 --> 37:56.280]  What is this thing I picked?
[37:56.540 --> 37:59.200]  Yeah, pick a thing and then follow it with what is it?
[38:00.500 --> 38:02.500]  I'm adapting to the table.
[38:02.940 --> 38:03.800]  You're doing great.
[38:03.880 --> 38:04.220]  Yeah.
[38:04.340 --> 38:05.140]  You're doing great.
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.820]  That was definitely on my list.
[38:07.220 --> 38:07.500]  Okay.
[38:08.400 --> 38:11.380]  And you consider Mexican Coke to be different than Coke?
[38:11.480 --> 38:12.960]  This is why I didn't pick it, Gavin.
[38:14.080 --> 38:15.400]  Oh, you didn't pick it?
[38:15.740 --> 38:17.220]  Well, I didn't pick it because...
[38:17.960 --> 38:21.020]  Yeah, it was on my list, but I didn't pick it because I didn't want to have this conversation
[38:21.020 --> 38:23.160]  about how it was different from Coca-Cola and your pick.
[38:23.760 --> 38:24.700]  No, it is different.
[38:24.780 --> 38:25.520]  Yeah, it is different.
[38:25.740 --> 38:28.980]  It's different brands and like a Doritos Coke or a...
[38:28.980 --> 38:31.640]  I mean, if you want to go with Cola, you could have went with a Pepsi.
[38:31.640 --> 38:33.500]  There's all sorts of Colas you could pick.
[38:33.660 --> 38:35.100]  Yeah, it's night and day.
[38:35.300 --> 38:36.920]  It's Americano and latte.
[38:39.660 --> 38:41.920]  I was on your side with the coffee thing.
[38:42.780 --> 38:43.680]  You would have put it to a vote.
[38:44.160 --> 38:44.780]  Here's the thing.
[38:45.100 --> 38:49.020]  The one thing I'll say in Americano's defense, it doesn't have the word coffee in it.
[38:49.100 --> 38:51.120]  Mexican Coke still has the word Coke in it.
[38:56.820 --> 38:59.300]  My favorite Coke is Geoff's Kitchen Coke.
[39:00.300 --> 39:01.300]  It's pretty localized.
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.620]  Crisp Diet Coke.
[39:05.180 --> 39:07.160]  I like Crispy Diet Coke.
[39:09.100 --> 39:11.480]  Wow, what a list. What a solid list from everyone.
[39:11.980 --> 39:18.880]  Well, let's run them down and we can talk about it. Gavin picked Coffee Bar for Lil Mexican.
[39:19.960 --> 39:23.760]  That's got to be the least complimentary set of drinks I've ever heard.
[39:24.100 --> 39:28.160]  Is Lil the only one on the list that's no longer commercially available?
[39:28.700 --> 39:29.840]  It is, right? Yeah.
[39:30.100 --> 39:30.500]  Probably.
[39:31.170 --> 39:36.160]  Andrew picked Coca-Cola, Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, Code Red, and Barks Root Beer.
[39:36.300 --> 39:42.340]  Nick picked Americano, London Fog with Espresso, Lemonade, Arnold Palmer.
[39:43.900 --> 39:48.640]  That's maybe the funniest list on this whole thing.
[39:49.300 --> 39:55.540]  Eric picked Diet Coke, Pumpkin Spice Latte, Horchata, Eggnog aka Milk Punch.
[39:55.540 --> 40:05.160]  And Geoff picked Diet Starry, Vimto, Root 44, Diet Cherry, Limeade from Sonic, and Sweet Tea.
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.160]  I'm amazed at everybody's picks. The fact that Nick just cannibalized from Nick over and over.
[40:13.380 --> 40:18.540]  I did not expect Andrew to go out of the gate. Four sodas for Andrew.
[40:19.240 --> 40:20.620]  I didn't expect you to go Vimto.
[40:21.220 --> 40:22.580]  Wow, I had to keep guessing.
[40:24.660 --> 40:27.420]  Nick's picks is like a family tree of drinks.
[40:27.960 --> 40:30.340]  It really... it's crazy.
[40:30.500 --> 40:31.000]  But they're all different.
[40:37.760 --> 40:44.620]  An Americano is different from a London Fog with Espresso because there's tea in one of them and the other one doesn't have tea in it.
[40:44.720 --> 40:45.700]  But it's exactly the same.
[40:45.940 --> 40:47.160]  You got it. They're different.
[40:47.760 --> 40:50.240]  And an Arnold Palmer is totally different than Lemonade.
[40:50.240 --> 40:50.980]  Yeah, it's half.
[40:54.440 --> 40:56.940]  My last pick should have been Sweet Tea and Vimto.
[41:02.660 --> 41:07.560]  Oh yeah, my last pick is a Gavin Free. It's a Sweet Tea with Vimto.
[41:09.240 --> 41:18.760]  One of the many joys of doing these is not at all expecting it to go the way that I think it will.
[41:19.460 --> 41:26.660]  In my head, it's a debate of what brand, what version of Barks or Root Beer do you like the best, what version of this.
[41:27.140 --> 41:31.440]  I never could have predicted that Nick would essentially pick the same drink four times.
[41:32.240 --> 41:33.680]  Or I guess twice, twice.
[41:34.620 --> 41:38.860]  I'm actually right there with you, Andrew. I'm a little flummoxed by Nick's picks.
[41:39.380 --> 41:43.420]  I think Nick's on track to win this draft.
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.780]  There's no way Nick wins.
[41:45.780 --> 41:48.380]  If Nick wins, it's on comedy value.
[41:49.820 --> 41:54.260]  If you're a coffee fan, you're voting with Nick.
[41:54.440 --> 41:55.860]  Even if I picked coffee.
[41:58.060 --> 42:01.860]  Well, yeah, because if I pick you, you also pick Bovril and Lilt.
[42:02.640 --> 42:04.560]  Alright, I may have been going for comedy a little bit.
[42:05.980 --> 42:08.420]  Oh, I was going for spite.
[42:09.300 --> 42:16.160]  Jesus Christ. Well, guys, go vote on our Patreon. Whoever wins gets their first choice.
[42:16.700 --> 42:18.240]  I don't want a Diet Coke.
[42:18.600 --> 42:21.660]  Yeah, Eric is going to either get a drink he doesn't want.
[42:22.500 --> 42:25.300]  Gavin is going to get just black coffee, I guess.
[42:25.700 --> 42:31.780]  Yeah, and then Nick is going to get his first and second pick.
[42:37.760 --> 42:39.600]  Geoff and I will be happy. We win.
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.020]  Yeah, I'll take it. I have a varied list. None of my stuff is...
[42:45.020 --> 42:48.760]  All my stuff is unique and original. Not stolen from anybody else.
[42:51.140 --> 42:52.440]  What a draft.
[42:54.180 --> 42:57.760]  It's the most I don't know how the poll is going to go. I have no clue.
[42:58.380 --> 42:59.520]  That was one of our best.
[43:00.170 --> 43:05.320]  Definitely. Guys, go follow us on Patreon. Follow us on social.
[43:05.460 --> 43:09.600]  Go listen to the podcast. Check out Regulation Gameplay where we put all of our gameplays up.
[43:10.080 --> 43:12.040]  This one was a crazy one. This one was punchy.
[43:12.040 --> 43:12.460]  What a draft.
[43:13.120 --> 43:17.240]  Yeah, thank you so much. Guys, anything else before we take off?
[43:18.280 --> 43:27.440]  Just Pepsi, Sprite, Mountain Dew, Baja Blast, Canada Dry, 7 Up, Mugroot Beer, Grape Crush, Orange Crush,
[43:27.440 --> 43:34.620]  Mountain Dew, Melon, Cherry Barks, Cherry Coke, Orange Fresca, Doritos Pineapple, Doritos Cola, L&P, Hot Chocolate.
[43:35.860 --> 43:36.340]  This is real.
[43:37.340 --> 43:38.220]  Hot Chocolate.
[43:38.720 --> 43:41.560]  I was trying to get Lucozade and Iron Brew on there, but they never came up.
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.500]  Shout out to Orange Juice. I'm sorry I didn't pick you, but I still love you.
[43:49.600 --> 43:51.760]  Alright, thank you for watching. Bye.
[43:52.320 --> 43:52.900]  Bye now.
[43:52.900 --> 43:57.280]  I draft Orange Juice with less pulp would be my pick if Geoff won Orange Juice.
[43:57.440 --> 43:58.160]  They're different.
[43:58.580 --> 43:59.600]  Dude, I'll take your point.
[43:59.620 --> 44:00.120]  They're completely different.
[44:00.400 --> 44:00.760]  They're different.
[44:01.640 --> 44:02.180]  Like my pick.
[44:02.240 --> 44:02.380]  Bye.
