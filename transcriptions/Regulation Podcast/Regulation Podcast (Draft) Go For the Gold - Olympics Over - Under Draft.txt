[00:00.000 --> 00:02.560]  Hello and welcome to the Olympics.
[00:02.880 --> 00:05.240]  It's time for the Olympics. It's a big event.
[00:05.380 --> 00:06.540]  I don't know if you've heard of it.
[00:06.700 --> 00:08.260]  Happens every four years.
[00:08.520 --> 00:10.340]  Welcome to the Olympics.
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.000]  Welcome to the Olympics.
[00:12.340 --> 00:13.260]  Is there one this year?
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.600]  No, there wasn't.
[00:15.700 --> 00:16.560]  There was one.
[00:17.100 --> 00:18.040]  Wasn't there a weird one?
[00:18.420 --> 00:20.560]  Wasn't it like two years ago because of COVID?
[00:21.080 --> 00:24.360]  There are three years of Olympics every two years because of the winter and summer.
[00:24.660 --> 00:26.060]  Yeah, but this is the Summer Olympics.
[00:26.460 --> 00:28.940]  If this is the Olympics, we got it on Wish.com.
[00:28.940 --> 00:33.280]  Yeah, I hooked up a team of Olympics for you.
[00:33.360 --> 00:33.900]  You get ready.
[00:36.180 --> 00:40.180]  This is the we're looking at a sheet right now of a bunch of things.
[00:40.460 --> 00:41.200]  It's a big event.
[00:41.460 --> 00:44.720]  And it's I feel like it's fun when we have ways to engage
[00:44.720 --> 00:48.140]  with things that are happening, much like the Summer Movie League.
[00:48.660 --> 00:52.420]  So this is something I did last Summer Olympics.
[00:53.140 --> 00:56.860]  If you may notice on the left of the screen, you have a country
[00:57.340 --> 00:58.300]  and then you have a number.
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.080]  We are going to go over unders on gold medal predictions
[01:03.080 --> 01:05.000]  for each of these countries.
[01:05.380 --> 01:06.540]  Oh, I like this.
[01:06.700 --> 01:09.920]  And we will see at the end of it who gets the most right.
[01:10.440 --> 01:12.140]  Now, where did you get these betting lines from?
[01:12.280 --> 01:13.560]  Is this from a country's official?
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.660]  So some of these are official.
[01:15.800 --> 01:18.500]  Some of these are just like statistical previews.
[01:18.540 --> 01:21.900]  It was tough to get betting lines for every country.
[01:22.600 --> 01:26.040]  And now there are, to my knowledge, 206 countries.
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.160]  And then the refugee team competing in the Olympics.
[01:28.340 --> 01:30.340]  But I don't see 206 countries.
[01:30.660 --> 01:33.340]  No, that felt like it would be way too long.
[01:33.460 --> 01:37.860]  Also, yeah, a lot of countries are predicted to win like one medal,
[01:37.980 --> 01:39.700]  maybe one gold, maybe. Yeah.
[01:39.740 --> 01:41.580]  So just it felt like a waste of space.
[01:41.960 --> 01:43.080]  We got Eswatini.
[01:44.400 --> 01:46.340]  That's, you know, next time.
[01:46.560 --> 01:50.640]  And four years from now, Eswatini is going to be all over this.
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.720]  So are you saying this is the cream of the country crop, as it were?
[01:55.400 --> 01:58.380]  It is the ones that were available
[01:58.380 --> 02:01.500]  and then ones that were not impossible to find info on.
[02:01.840 --> 02:05.500]  OK, so surprisingly difficult to find lines on a lot of countries.
[02:05.660 --> 02:08.740]  One would assume that only the cream of the crop would be readily available.
[02:08.940 --> 02:11.320]  So for the rest of the country, you're less.
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.240]  According to Andrew and the Olympic Committee and betting lines,
[02:15.260 --> 02:18.180]  you're less significant is what they're saying, not I.
[02:18.860 --> 02:21.860]  So what we're doing here is we're going over under
[02:21.860 --> 02:24.060]  and that's cumulative medals, right?
[02:24.060 --> 02:26.820]  It's like gold, silver and bronze all put together.
[02:27.280 --> 02:29.580]  Yeah. Sorry, this is specifically gold medals.
[02:30.400 --> 02:32.140]  Oh, OK. So solely.
[02:32.320 --> 02:34.520]  Definitely not what I thought we were doing.
[02:35.160 --> 02:37.120]  OK. Whoa.
[02:37.340 --> 02:38.420]  Mentioned it earlier.
[02:38.780 --> 02:43.040]  May have got lost in Swahili or whatever you said, Gavin.
[02:43.320 --> 02:43.820]  I don't know.
[02:45.720 --> 02:49.940]  OK, so so we're taking the line of over under
[02:50.420 --> 02:54.560]  and we have the Anna order because it doesn't necessarily matter.
[02:54.780 --> 02:56.220]  No, not like what order are we going?
[02:56.380 --> 02:59.000]  But because I'd like to keep this.
[03:00.340 --> 03:04.200]  Like, I don't want Andrew to influence everyone the whole time, just in case.
[03:04.200 --> 03:05.900]  Yeah, we can. I can.
[03:06.020 --> 03:08.320]  I propose that we go in a step order.
[03:08.380 --> 03:10.480]  So Andrew would. So we're going in order.
[03:11.600 --> 03:13.760]  It's it's an egg order for the first one.
[03:13.820 --> 03:15.720]  The second one would start with Nick.
[03:15.800 --> 03:18.440]  With Nick. Yeah. And then go and go around.
[03:18.440 --> 03:21.480]  So we're doing like kind of a step down every time.
[03:21.620 --> 03:23.140]  So the third one's me. The fourth one's Geoff.
[03:23.280 --> 03:23.820]  The last one's Gavin.
[03:23.920 --> 03:25.540]  And then back to Andrew for the sixth one.
[03:25.800 --> 03:27.180]  And we just kind of keep going around that way.
[03:27.260 --> 03:30.280]  It's not influencing it like it's not Andrew every time going first.
[03:30.540 --> 03:34.940]  We I got psycho brain because you said the step thing and I immediately got it.
[03:34.960 --> 03:36.680]  I did not need an explanation at all.
[03:37.100 --> 03:38.440]  Wow. Really? Oh, that's great.
[03:38.700 --> 03:40.360]  Immediately. Yeah, it's fantastic.
[03:40.840 --> 03:42.260]  It's cool. Step in.
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.120]  Great. I think that's fantastic.
[03:44.780 --> 03:46.260]  Yeah. You say it's pretty clear.
[03:46.340 --> 03:47.800]  But Nick was over here going, what?
[03:47.800 --> 03:50.960]  Yeah, yeah. That's that's why I explained it.
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.240]  OK, so, Gavin, do you have any questions before we get started?
[03:57.560 --> 03:58.760]  That's that's thank you.
[03:58.780 --> 04:00.180]  That is exactly what's going to go next.
[04:01.060 --> 04:02.760]  So you see, there's a number, Gavin.
[04:03.200 --> 04:03.920]  Yeah. Yeah.
[04:04.040 --> 04:08.080]  Before we go, Gavin, can I I have a question I'd like to jump in.
[04:08.340 --> 04:10.660]  Do you understand what we're about to do, Gavin?
[04:11.320 --> 04:12.500]  No. OK.
[04:13.300 --> 04:15.500]  I really thought this one was easy.
[04:15.500 --> 04:21.100]  Well, I just say if I think the USA are going to get over or under 41.5.
[04:21.160 --> 04:22.640]  That's right. Metals. Gold.
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.440]  It's correct. Gold. Gold.
[04:24.660 --> 04:26.240]  Metals. Metals. You do understand.
[04:26.520 --> 04:28.140]  I guess I do get it. You got it. Yeah.
[04:28.680 --> 04:30.380]  That's great. It's the most right.
[04:30.680 --> 04:33.740]  At the end of this, we'll win an Olympic prize.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.960]  Oh, I think I think we should.
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.160]  I think somebody should win a medal.
[04:37.700 --> 04:40.860]  Yeah, absolutely. Or a medal adjacent thing of some kind.
[04:41.180 --> 04:42.460]  Oh, I like that. OK.
[04:42.460 --> 04:43.380]  Metal chocolate.
[04:43.900 --> 04:45.480]  Maybe not a metal, maybe a plastic.
[04:46.220 --> 04:47.380]  Maybe Medal of Honor.
[04:47.900 --> 04:50.600]  Who knows? Medal of Honor on PS1?
[04:52.100 --> 04:53.560]  Maybe. Maybe PS2.
[04:54.160 --> 04:56.000]  Maybe 360. They went crazy.
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.500]  Can you believe they made a 360 Medal of Honor?
[04:58.560 --> 04:59.580]  They really got that.
[04:59.920 --> 05:02.040]  That franchise really got killed by Call of Duty.
[05:02.160 --> 05:03.060]  Oh, yeah, it did.
[05:03.820 --> 05:06.020]  Oh, yeah. Top of the food chain for about five years there.
[05:06.100 --> 05:07.960]  And then Call of Duty just shit right down their mouths.
[05:08.140 --> 05:11.560]  But wasn't wasn't Medal of Honor wasn't like the Call of Duty team,
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.040]  like the original Medal of Honor team?
[05:13.260 --> 05:15.680]  I think so. Like they left and went to Activision or something.
[05:16.200 --> 05:18.360]  Yeah. Yeah, because I think when they started Call of Duty,
[05:18.360 --> 05:19.980]  they called it like the Medal of Honor killer.
[05:20.200 --> 05:21.820]  It was like, oh, Jesus Christ.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.860]  Oh, and it was. Yeah.
[05:24.060 --> 05:26.980]  Well, it's because back then, especially because things were a little bit more,
[05:27.180 --> 05:30.380]  you know, not PC, but you just you couldn't say some stuff in media.
[05:30.540 --> 05:35.000]  Yeah. Like they couldn't put in a Nintendo Power or a PlayStation magazine.
[05:36.620 --> 05:39.240]  We're going to shit down the mouths of Medal of Honor
[05:39.240 --> 05:42.280]  until they choke on our poop and then they die
[05:43.100 --> 05:46.480]  full of poop in their throat, in esophagus.
[05:46.980 --> 05:49.960]  That's so they so they breathe poop and choked on poop.
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.700]  All right. All right, Gavin.
[05:51.780 --> 05:53.140]  So you do know what we're doing, right, Gavin?
[05:53.640 --> 05:55.000]  Yeah. OK, great.
[05:55.200 --> 05:57.100]  Let's let's begin with Andrew.
[05:57.160 --> 06:00.860]  Andrew, we have a line of forty one and a half gold medals
[06:01.380 --> 06:03.040]  for the United States of America.
[06:03.160 --> 06:05.020]  Will you be taking the over or the under?
[06:06.260 --> 06:08.280]  Oh, this is a this is an easy call for me.
[06:08.780 --> 06:10.860]  People are fucking up the USA.
[06:10.980 --> 06:12.500]  USA is going to have a bad year.
[06:12.640 --> 06:13.720]  I can feel it in my bones.
[06:14.700 --> 06:16.280]  Wow. One medal, especially.
[06:16.900 --> 06:18.880]  They're not going to get that basketball gold.
[06:19.040 --> 06:20.240]  That's going to Canada this year.
[06:20.280 --> 06:23.000]  I'm taking the under on the forty one point five.
[06:23.980 --> 06:25.300]  Canada plays basketball.
[06:26.080 --> 06:27.920]  Oh, you're talking all this shit.
[06:28.140 --> 06:30.160]  America has got the second best team.
[06:30.640 --> 06:33.580]  America was two points away from losing to whatever nation
[06:33.580 --> 06:35.140]  Gavin said ten minutes ago.
[06:35.140 --> 06:40.820]  If you if you play on the Toronto Raptors, are you eligible to be
[06:41.500 --> 06:43.100]  a Canadian? You really should.
[06:43.500 --> 06:44.000]  You should.
[06:44.300 --> 06:45.320]  They revoked all U.S.
[06:45.500 --> 06:48.160]  passports for the Raptors players and told them they couldn't go back
[06:48.160 --> 06:49.380]  to the States until they played for Canada.
[06:49.900 --> 06:50.160]  Smart.
[06:51.960 --> 06:53.980]  Nick, over under forty one and a half.
[06:54.180 --> 06:56.220]  Oh, just for that, I'm going over basketball.
[06:56.880 --> 06:57.700]  Patriot over here.
[06:57.860 --> 07:01.400]  I'm absolutely I'm absolutely taking the over as well.
[07:01.400 --> 07:05.300]  Like, no doubt, USA, strong pride, American exceptionalism.
[07:05.920 --> 07:08.440]  I think easiest money today.
[07:08.960 --> 07:09.520]  Take the over.
[07:10.240 --> 07:14.820]  OK, and let's see Gavin over under forty one and a half.
[07:15.080 --> 07:16.020]  Oh, definitely under.
[07:16.720 --> 07:18.860]  Oh, I had a right, Gavin.
[07:19.220 --> 07:22.540]  You be feeling the foreigners would have something to say about it.
[07:23.620 --> 07:25.880]  Yeah. OK, that's that's pretty.
[07:25.960 --> 07:27.340]  He believes in Team Canada, too.
[07:27.940 --> 07:29.220]  He's equally. I don't know about that.
[07:29.820 --> 07:35.180]  I do. So we have two unders and three overs.
[07:35.340 --> 07:38.120]  This is I'm very excited to see we already have a split
[07:38.120 --> 07:40.380]  and I'm very excited to see how this kind of like keeps going.
[07:41.620 --> 07:46.260]  OK. Second, China at thirty four and a half.
[07:46.440 --> 07:47.680]  Nick, what do you think?
[07:48.780 --> 07:51.620]  I know nothing about the Olympics over.
[07:52.700 --> 07:53.080]  OK.
[07:55.080 --> 07:59.500]  I am also going to take the over Chinese exceptionalism.
[07:59.660 --> 08:02.920]  I do believe that China is going to have a great year in the Summer Olympics.
[08:03.180 --> 08:03.960]  Stronger than ever.
[08:04.620 --> 08:07.040]  Always bet on red. I take the over on China.
[08:07.260 --> 08:09.880]  Wow. OK, OK. Where are the medals made?
[08:11.780 --> 08:13.740]  Host, I think the host nation makes them.
[08:14.340 --> 08:15.660]  OK, so it's Paris.
[08:16.440 --> 08:19.920]  Yeah, because I know when they were made for the Tokyo Olympics, I know they took
[08:19.920 --> 08:24.180]  the gold was stripped from old like computer parts and like melted down.
[08:24.300 --> 08:25.400]  And that was like a big thing about it.
[08:25.860 --> 08:29.520]  So I think it's whoever the host nation is makes them maybe under.
[08:30.940 --> 08:33.040]  Under. I listen.
[08:34.140 --> 08:38.720]  And Andrew, I feel like China is under a lot of duress from what I I'm
[08:38.720 --> 08:39.940]  not paying attention to China.
[08:40.120 --> 08:43.820]  I feel like I'm hearing a lot of bad things about China and my peripheral.
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.740]  They're struggling, maybe not struggling.
[08:45.920 --> 08:48.040]  It just seems like maybe not the greatest times.
[08:48.040 --> 08:50.020]  I don't know, though, because I don't pay attention.
[08:50.440 --> 08:51.480]  That could be completely wrong.
[08:51.700 --> 08:53.640]  I'm going under. Are you talking about what?
[08:53.820 --> 08:57.680]  I just I feel like the vibes in China are not great right now.
[08:58.360 --> 09:00.540]  I feel like there's some bad Chinese vibes.
[09:00.980 --> 09:01.680]  And so I'm going under.
[09:01.720 --> 09:03.140]  What are you saying?
[09:03.680 --> 09:05.840]  Distance me from all of this.
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.380]  No, I'm just giving up your thought process.
[09:09.640 --> 09:12.180]  I was very clear in that that might be incorrect,
[09:12.180 --> 09:16.440]  but I feel like there's a lot of bad vibes around China at the moment.
[09:16.440 --> 09:18.880]  But Andrew is the vibes connoisseur or whatever.
[09:19.000 --> 09:19.800]  He's the vibe guy.
[09:20.020 --> 09:21.200]  He detects vibes.
[09:21.460 --> 09:22.300]  Vibe inspector?
[09:22.620 --> 09:23.720]  Is that what his title is?
[09:23.840 --> 09:25.000]  That was, but you're right.
[09:25.320 --> 09:26.520]  Yeah, we were going to get a t-shirt.
[09:26.760 --> 09:27.280]  Vibe inspector.
[09:27.920 --> 09:30.840]  Was that a few years ago where the people like elections?
[09:30.960 --> 09:31.520]  And I don't know.
[09:31.620 --> 09:32.660]  I don't know what's going on.
[09:32.940 --> 09:35.260]  I just I feel like the vibes might be a little bad.
[09:35.920 --> 09:36.420]  Might be distracting.
[09:36.520 --> 09:38.980]  He's reading the vibe leaves and that's what's coming up.
[09:41.040 --> 09:42.180]  There's something happening.
[09:42.700 --> 09:43.200]  I don't know.
[09:43.800 --> 09:45.160]  Something brewing in China.
[09:45.160 --> 09:48.300]  Oh, if you know, and if it's not brewing, at the very least,
[09:48.300 --> 09:51.280]  we got some foreign fault solidarity between Gavin and I that I.
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.420]  Yeah. Yeah.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.860]  Wow. This is some bullshit.
[09:54.680 --> 09:55.360]  There you go.
[09:55.760 --> 09:59.360]  This starts with me at Great Britain, and I don't even have to give a preamble
[09:59.360 --> 09:59.980]  for it under.
[10:00.220 --> 10:01.800]  I mean, like, no, really?
[10:02.260 --> 10:05.140]  Like, yeah, they finally like they finally voted Labor.
[10:05.280 --> 10:06.960]  It took them 14 years or whatever.
[10:07.080 --> 10:08.040]  So like, that's embarrassing.
[10:08.240 --> 10:11.660]  And 14, 14 and a half medals is under.
[10:11.780 --> 10:14.500]  So I'm just I'm going with I'm going with the Labor.
[10:15.260 --> 10:20.740]  Yeah. So the whole country is down in the dumps because it didn't come home.
[10:20.860 --> 10:21.720]  They're not in the right mind.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.840]  It's true. It's true.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.680]  I take the under. OK, OK.
[10:26.060 --> 10:27.320]  Gavin, Great Britain.
[10:27.740 --> 10:28.760]  Oh, definitely under.
[10:32.920 --> 10:33.800]  Fucking perfect.
[10:33.940 --> 10:35.220]  Gavin's been under on everything.
[10:35.340 --> 10:35.840]  This rocks.
[10:36.680 --> 10:40.100]  Andrew over under 14 to have you thrown me for a real loop here
[10:40.100 --> 10:42.780]  because I was ready to go under because it didn't come home.
[10:42.820 --> 10:43.940]  I felt like, as Geoff said,
[10:43.940 --> 10:46.100]  there could be some some negative.
[10:46.340 --> 10:48.380]  But you just told me they voted Labor, apparently,
[10:48.960 --> 10:51.960]  which seems like they're into work and working hard.
[10:52.860 --> 10:57.500]  Yes, I Gavin, when you hear that, does it really resonate for you?
[10:57.960 --> 10:59.080]  Is it what this is?
[10:59.640 --> 11:02.960]  Labor to me implies there's some activity going on.
[11:03.200 --> 11:04.760]  Is that what y'all thought of Brexit?
[11:06.220 --> 11:08.060]  See, Brexit is the opposite.
[11:08.260 --> 11:09.660]  That exit is in it.
[11:09.740 --> 11:10.380]  They're leaving.
[11:10.640 --> 11:11.920]  They're right. Right.
[11:12.140 --> 11:13.120]  Right. Of course.
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.820]  But Labor, when I think Labor, I think I'm working hard.
[11:18.080 --> 11:19.240]  This is a tough thing.
[11:19.500 --> 11:21.500]  I'm into getting stuff done.
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.300]  But the training for the Olympics is much longer than one year.
[11:25.780 --> 11:29.160]  Yeah, a lot of the training would have been conservative rule.
[11:29.660 --> 11:31.380]  Yeah, I'm a mental warrior, Gavin.
[11:31.460 --> 11:35.320]  I'm talking about the vibes and the mindset going into these games.
[11:35.700 --> 11:37.820]  I'm taking the over on this because of Labor.
[11:37.900 --> 11:39.480]  Wow. Going with the over.
[11:39.640 --> 11:41.080]  I'm going with the over. They're locked in.
[11:41.080 --> 11:48.800]  Based on the hardworking nose to the grindstone mentality of the Labor party.
[11:49.140 --> 11:50.240]  Well, I don't know there.
[11:50.560 --> 11:52.600]  Listen, I'm not the party I have no clue about.
[11:52.740 --> 11:54.840]  But when I hear Labor...
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.020]  Could just be good British.
[11:57.820 --> 12:00.040]  This just became my favorite piece of content.
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.200]  This is crazy.
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.020]  Nick, what do you think?
[12:04.500 --> 12:06.980]  Historically, Britain doesn't do well in France.
[12:07.180 --> 12:07.860]  So they're going under.
[12:08.840 --> 12:11.060]  Oh, wow. I mean, that's pretty...
[12:12.000 --> 12:12.440]  It's pretty accurate.
[12:12.440 --> 12:13.100]  It's pretty accurate.
[12:13.240 --> 12:14.100]  What happened to Britain and France?
[12:14.320 --> 12:14.940]  Well, they lost.
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.460]  How many wars was it? Let's see.
[12:17.740 --> 12:20.340]  Yeah, there's only two of them.
[12:20.600 --> 12:21.960]  So they fought 41.
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.860]  And I think France won 24.
[12:24.160 --> 12:25.780]  Only two wars in all of history.
[12:26.680 --> 12:27.720]  Oh, well, I forgot.
[12:27.900 --> 12:29.140]  Are you thinking of a world war?
[12:29.260 --> 12:30.120]  They were on the same side.
[12:30.360 --> 12:33.840]  Canada's taking the basketball medal and there's only been two wars.
[12:35.780 --> 12:38.600]  The vibes are weird in China this year, guys.
[12:40.140 --> 12:42.100]  They're off. The vibes are off.
[12:43.160 --> 12:44.300]  Or in international.
[12:45.240 --> 12:53.440]  Geoff, speaking of France, France is favored at 24 and a half.
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.340]  What do you think? The over under again.
[12:55.420 --> 12:56.360]  This is in Paris.
[12:56.800 --> 12:57.920]  So they're in gay pari.
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.780]  I feel like the host nation bump is already factored into the over under, obviously.
[13:04.320 --> 13:07.920]  But that being said, you just you cannot discount
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.600]  the benefit of watching a home team play on their home court
[13:13.260 --> 13:16.800]  or a home athlete perform on his or her home court.
[13:16.860 --> 13:17.680]  So I'm going to take the over.
[13:18.340 --> 13:19.160]  OK, over.
[13:19.820 --> 13:21.820]  Gavin, how do you feel about the French in general?
[13:22.260 --> 13:24.060]  Well, I was raised to boo at them.
[13:24.180 --> 13:25.500]  So I'm going to go under.
[13:25.780 --> 13:27.200]  Wow. They're playing football.
[13:27.200 --> 13:32.120]  I want them to lose or tennis or the French people play cricket.
[13:32.420 --> 13:32.860]  I don't know.
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.240]  It's a good question.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.000]  Andrew, Andrew, the host country.
[13:39.040 --> 13:40.280]  I mean, there's a lot of things to take in.
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.020]  First of all, I know they had an election recently.
[13:43.220 --> 13:46.900]  Does anyone was the Labor Party involved in that election?
[13:48.220 --> 13:52.720]  They win the the the they have a labor party.
[13:53.040 --> 13:53.420]  There was
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.360]  politically the results are very similar. True.
[13:58.480 --> 14:00.100]  Yeah. OK, got it.
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.760]  Yeah. So, I mean, I guess you can.
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.240]  What is it called?
[14:03.320 --> 14:04.980]  It's like the it's like the people's.
[14:04.980 --> 14:06.000]  So it's.
[14:08.080 --> 14:08.880]  Whatever it's.
[14:09.060 --> 14:09.540]  You got it. Yeah.
[14:09.640 --> 14:10.780]  What do you think? I don't care.
[14:10.880 --> 14:15.080]  I'm thinking, well, the macaron and makes me think of the the treat
[14:16.260 --> 14:18.200]  I always enjoy. Right.
[14:18.700 --> 14:20.220]  But there's political unrest.
[14:20.300 --> 14:21.400]  But then they had an election.
[14:21.580 --> 14:23.980]  From my understanding, they were like, oh, it's doing immediate.
[14:24.200 --> 14:25.220]  Who cares? Nobody cares.
[14:26.060 --> 14:28.640]  I'm surprised the French are good at this many things.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.920]  To be honest, I don't think of them as like an all around.
[14:32.120 --> 14:33.360]  We're doing a lot of good stuff.
[14:33.360 --> 14:35.800]  Not necessarily bad stuff, but athletics.
[14:36.620 --> 14:39.360]  What? 20 or 24 and a half.
[14:39.760 --> 14:40.820]  I'm going to take.
[14:41.060 --> 14:43.720]  Oh, man. What's my read on this?
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.680]  I'm going over and over.
[14:46.020 --> 14:46.840]  OK. Yeah.
[14:46.860 --> 14:47.960]  Host nation, as you said.
[14:48.580 --> 14:49.480]  Yep. Nick, what do you think?
[14:49.600 --> 14:50.740]  Home field advantage.
[14:51.200 --> 14:53.040]  And I'm just going with the signs.
[14:53.100 --> 14:54.220]  I had French fries this week.
[14:54.500 --> 14:55.180]  So over.
[14:56.060 --> 14:56.780]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[14:57.160 --> 15:00.500]  Well, I can say that you guys are vastly overestimating
[15:00.500 --> 15:05.200]  the home field advantage as nobody hates the French more than the French.
[15:05.340 --> 15:09.560]  They have conspired to all shit and toilets at the same time
[15:09.560 --> 15:11.620]  to flood the river with shit.
[15:11.780 --> 15:14.280]  They do not care whether they win or lose.
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.820]  They don't want you speaking their language to them.
[15:17.120 --> 15:19.840]  And for those reasons, I have to give France the under.
[15:20.100 --> 15:23.360]  I think that they they're smoking cigarettes
[15:23.360 --> 15:28.040]  and their laissez faire attitude will not lead them to over 24 and a half.
[15:28.100 --> 15:28.920]  So 25 medals.
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.160]  So that's got to go.
[15:30.300 --> 15:32.360]  Tell that to the U.S. soccer team yesterday.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.900]  And they're used to swimming in shit rivers.
[15:36.000 --> 15:36.760]  So let's go. Come on.
[15:37.560 --> 15:40.160]  Yeah. All of our rivers are shit rivers in America.
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.880]  Yeah. Gavin, coming to you here for the first pick on Italy,
[15:46.060 --> 15:48.140]  over under ten and a half.
[15:48.300 --> 15:51.100]  You feel like the other half of my bloodlines.
[15:51.320 --> 15:52.600]  Yeah. What are your bones saying?
[15:52.680 --> 15:53.820]  What's the blood saying?
[15:55.000 --> 15:57.860]  If I'm checking the nourishment, I'm going to say slightly undernourished.
[15:58.780 --> 16:00.700]  Really? That's an under from me.
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.100]  Under ten and a half. Wow.
[16:03.180 --> 16:04.400]  Who could have seen this coming?
[16:05.260 --> 16:07.020]  On every single one. This is crazy.
[16:08.160 --> 16:12.040]  Oh, I recently watched the Pixar animated film Luca.
[16:12.220 --> 16:14.000]  I enjoyed that quite a bit. Great movie.
[16:14.060 --> 16:19.060]  I enjoyed the Equalizer three, which also in an Italian small town.
[16:19.240 --> 16:21.160]  I've been really into Italy recently.
[16:21.280 --> 16:23.280]  I'm liking these small communities in Italy.
[16:23.540 --> 16:24.840]  I think they're going to go over.
[16:24.840 --> 16:27.880]  I'm feeling really the vibes on Italy right now.
[16:27.960 --> 16:29.700]  Real good. Real good vibes.
[16:29.860 --> 16:32.360]  What sport specifically do you think they're going to gold at?
[16:34.220 --> 16:36.420]  Swimming, because I just watched a fish movie.
[16:36.860 --> 16:38.160]  Swimming. Wait, no, no.
[16:38.560 --> 16:40.200]  Triathlon is triathlon in the Olympics.
[16:40.600 --> 16:41.760]  That's a big point. And Luca.
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.580]  Oh, yeah, I feel like the Italians will be a major disadvantage
[16:45.580 --> 16:47.500]  in the in the water because of all the hair.
[16:50.560 --> 16:52.540]  Now they're going to get waxed beforehand.
[16:52.540 --> 16:54.680]  They're doing OK. Full body.
[16:55.020 --> 16:57.060]  Nick, over under ten to half.
[16:59.340 --> 17:03.520]  I just watched The Last Crusade and they go to Venice in that movie.
[17:04.060 --> 17:05.200]  Let's go over.
[17:06.440 --> 17:08.600]  I don't. Yeah, makes sense.
[17:08.720 --> 17:10.420]  Got to go with your gut. I see how you got there.
[17:10.500 --> 17:12.240]  Yeah. Yeah. Smashed up that floor.
[17:12.500 --> 17:14.320]  I sure did. Yeah. Spoilers.
[17:15.300 --> 17:19.420]  I think I think this is
[17:20.380 --> 17:22.080]  the summer games.
[17:23.440 --> 17:26.520]  Hmm. I feel like Italy is going to go over,
[17:26.800 --> 17:30.440]  but like if if it's over, it's just to 11.
[17:30.620 --> 17:32.820]  Like, I don't think you know what I'm changing.
[17:32.980 --> 17:33.840]  It's under. Wow.
[17:34.300 --> 17:36.960]  Oh, yeah, I'm going under. Yeah, I just don't.
[17:37.060 --> 17:40.520]  Yeah, I just don't have I don't have the.
[17:41.840 --> 17:43.180]  I just don't believe in Italy.
[17:45.700 --> 17:47.940]  Like they're going to walk away with eight gold medals
[17:47.940 --> 17:49.200]  and then they'll be happy with it.
[17:49.200 --> 17:51.600]  And, you know, how did they do in the wars?
[17:51.760 --> 17:53.020]  The two wars that occurred?
[17:53.340 --> 17:55.180]  They didn't do great in World War Two.
[17:55.300 --> 17:58.340]  Yeah, they they really messed.
[17:58.400 --> 17:59.200]  I'm trying to remember.
[17:59.300 --> 18:01.940]  I don't think I played as them in Call of Duty, so.
[18:02.940 --> 18:03.540]  Played against them.
[18:04.060 --> 18:05.480]  Geoff, what do you think?
[18:05.740 --> 18:06.320]  Hey, man, to have.
[18:07.560 --> 18:10.060]  Well, I'm following Nick's line of thinking.
[18:10.180 --> 18:15.960]  I haven't seen Last Crusade recently, but I did visit Venice in person last year.
[18:16.020 --> 18:17.600]  And I got to say it was
[18:17.600 --> 18:21.020]  it was more crowded than I would have liked and stinky.
[18:21.360 --> 18:23.420]  And so for that, I'm going to take the under.
[18:23.660 --> 18:24.320]  Wow. Wow.
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.080]  OK, you take your hands off the chess piece, Geoff.
[18:27.140 --> 18:28.280]  I just want a quick question.
[18:28.760 --> 18:30.500]  How would Tony Soprano feel about this?
[18:30.500 --> 18:33.000]  Because I know he's been a big part of your life recently.
[18:33.120 --> 18:33.900]  He has been a huge.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.560]  We just watched the episode with that thing.
[18:37.640 --> 18:39.280]  We we sent around yesterday, actually.
[18:39.380 --> 18:42.960]  Oh, that's really it was so funny that it was just popped up.
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.300]  Tony Soprano would not like the state of Venice in 2024.
[18:46.300 --> 18:48.920]  I promise you he would want to do something about it.
[18:49.920 --> 18:53.900]  I mean, he went to he went to Italy and was walking along the beach
[18:53.900 --> 18:57.200]  that was just covered in like trash in the whole time he was in Italy.
[18:57.300 --> 18:58.340]  I don't think he loved it.
[18:58.480 --> 19:01.760]  So and they they weren't super happy with him either, honestly.
[19:01.960 --> 19:02.900]  No, no.
[19:03.680 --> 19:07.440]  He tried to get him a good deal on cars, but Australia is next.
[19:07.860 --> 19:09.020]  Fourteen and a half.
[19:09.600 --> 19:11.380]  Oi, what do you think, Andrew?
[19:11.760 --> 19:15.420]  One half of the biggest summer blockbuster
[19:15.420 --> 19:17.360]  anyone's ever goddamn seen.
[19:17.960 --> 19:21.720]  Wolverine Hugh Jackman in a movie called Australia.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.340]  Big money for Deadpool.
[19:23.700 --> 19:25.320]  Big gold for Australia.
[19:25.520 --> 19:27.320]  We're going over. It's going over.
[19:28.040 --> 19:28.900]  OK, over. OK.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  People are going to be all fucking pumped up about that Deadpool Wolverine.
[19:32.100 --> 19:34.340]  They've been waiting to see Wolverine in that yellow suit.
[19:34.900 --> 19:37.420]  I think it's really going to inspire the athletes to put their best.
[19:37.460 --> 19:38.600]  OK, OK.
[19:39.900 --> 19:41.020]  Nick, what do you think?
[19:41.440 --> 19:42.980]  Ah, it's long flight.
[19:42.980 --> 19:45.420]  Australia, the movie way too long.
[19:45.640 --> 19:48.840]  So way too long, way too long, way too long.
[19:48.940 --> 19:52.580]  So therefore, I'm going under, going under, under.
[19:52.720 --> 19:54.360]  Yeah. Overstayed their welcome.
[19:55.620 --> 20:01.780]  I have been getting an exceptional amount of Australian athlete TikToks.
[20:02.100 --> 20:07.520]  I feel as though they are not focused on bringing home the gold.
[20:07.560 --> 20:12.320]  It would not be surprised if they silvered out in most of these events.
[20:12.320 --> 20:14.120]  And for that reason, I'll be taking the under.
[20:14.440 --> 20:15.500]  This shit's insane.
[20:16.780 --> 20:20.260]  I would say this is the second easiest money of the day.
[20:21.100 --> 20:24.560]  I've spent a lot of time in Australia with the Australian people.
[20:24.580 --> 20:25.780]  They're proud. They're talented.
[20:26.300 --> 20:28.300]  I think they overperform consistently.
[20:28.560 --> 20:30.520]  I spent a spent a day in Perth.
[20:30.640 --> 20:32.440]  I would never bet against those people.
[20:32.540 --> 20:35.160]  If all the Olympic Australian Olympic athletes were from Perth,
[20:35.220 --> 20:37.200]  I would say that they'd win 40 gold medals.
[20:37.320 --> 20:39.020]  They're easily going to overperform.
[20:39.160 --> 20:39.900]  I take the over. OK.
[20:40.580 --> 20:42.920]  Over. And Gavin, what do you think of Australia?
[20:43.260 --> 20:44.020]  How do you think they're going to do?
[20:44.120 --> 20:45.960]  I think it's obvious it's down under.
[20:46.160 --> 20:47.140]  I'm taking the under.
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.760]  Oh, OK. All right.
[20:48.840 --> 20:50.800]  Oh, I like it.
[20:50.800 --> 20:52.520]  I like it. In the land of unders.
[20:53.640 --> 20:55.860]  So that's that's a nice split there.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.580]  But next, Nick, Canada, six and a half.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.280]  Oh, wow. You know what?
[21:02.700 --> 21:04.760]  This this is for this is for American basketball.
[21:04.900 --> 21:07.400]  Under, under, under, under.
[21:07.400 --> 21:08.840]  You have to think about it. Under.
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.840]  Go ahead, Geoff.
[21:10.080 --> 21:11.060]  No, don't get me wrong.
[21:11.240 --> 21:14.480]  I love Canada, but they are in every way a silver medal country.
[21:14.580 --> 21:16.160]  They're they're going to underperform.
[21:16.260 --> 21:17.760]  I'm taking the under. Under.
[21:18.040 --> 21:18.920]  And Gavin, what do you think?
[21:18.980 --> 21:19.840]  Canada, six and a half.
[21:20.480 --> 21:21.800]  Ooh. What's the top?
[21:21.880 --> 21:22.540]  The North Pole?
[21:22.780 --> 21:23.780]  That's the top of the world.
[21:23.900 --> 21:25.260]  Just under that. Yeah.
[21:25.480 --> 21:26.480]  Yeah, I would say it's Canada.
[21:26.840 --> 21:29.300]  I'm going under. Under it is.
[21:29.680 --> 21:31.640]  And what do you think, Andrew?
[21:32.580 --> 21:33.380]  The disrespect.
[21:34.120 --> 21:37.400]  You're not factoring in the NBA gold, first of all.
[21:37.400 --> 21:38.020]  You got to put that.
[21:38.140 --> 21:41.600]  OK, second of all, NHL athletes are back.
[21:41.700 --> 21:42.540]  They're back in this.
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.520]  Sidney Crosby, he's going to be there.
[21:44.600 --> 21:45.900]  Connor McDavid, he's going to be there.
[21:46.000 --> 21:47.320]  They do it a lot of summer hockey.
[21:49.380 --> 21:53.120]  OK, well, they might like they might they might go to the Olympics.
[21:53.220 --> 21:54.060]  It's the offseason.
[21:54.960 --> 21:55.760]  This rocks.
[21:56.160 --> 21:57.760]  The offseason in hockey.
[21:57.980 --> 21:59.220]  So when they're doing they might attend.
[21:59.780 --> 22:00.740]  Right. Which is a boost.
[22:00.800 --> 22:01.520]  It's a morale boost.
[22:01.840 --> 22:02.680]  The vibe, the Canadian.
[22:02.860 --> 22:05.160]  You get Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid hanging out.
[22:05.280 --> 22:06.760]  Canada is pretty excited about it.
[22:06.760 --> 22:09.840]  They like it a lot, like black asses.
[22:10.640 --> 22:13.380]  I'm going to go Canada over.
[22:14.200 --> 22:15.680]  Shocker. We could have predicted.
[22:16.220 --> 22:18.700]  OK, they should play Terry Fox, baby.
[22:19.340 --> 22:20.100]  Yeah, coming home.
[22:20.640 --> 22:22.340]  It's coming home.
[22:22.700 --> 22:23.140]  It's coming.
[22:23.600 --> 22:25.240]  Seven of them.
[22:25.300 --> 22:26.260]  I'm next pick.
[22:26.540 --> 22:28.980]  Netherlands, 15 and a half.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.840]  That's a lot for the Netherlands.
[22:33.420 --> 22:33.940]  It is.
[22:34.420 --> 22:35.920]  That's a lot.
[22:35.920 --> 22:38.900]  Like an exceptional amount, but.
[22:39.720 --> 22:42.040]  I'm just going to I'm going to I'm going to go out on a limb.
[22:42.260 --> 22:42.860]  I'm going to say over.
[22:43.420 --> 22:44.140]  I'm going to try it.
[22:44.340 --> 22:47.120]  I'm going to try over on this one and see where it takes me.
[22:47.300 --> 22:49.260]  Geoff, not a good year for the Netherlands.
[22:49.420 --> 22:50.300]  They're going to I'm taking the under.
[22:51.140 --> 22:52.780]  Oh, OK, cool.
[22:53.500 --> 22:54.740]  Gavin, what do you think?
[22:55.460 --> 22:56.320]  Uh, nether.
[22:56.560 --> 22:57.880]  I think, you know, it means like lower.
[22:58.480 --> 22:59.400]  So I'm going to go under.
[22:59.980 --> 23:01.400]  Oh, OK. That's cool.
[23:01.600 --> 23:02.160]  That's good.
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.660]  And, um, Andrew, 15, never met a person from the Netherlands.
[23:06.800 --> 23:09.860]  I've liked Bad Nation, my opinion.
[23:10.660 --> 23:11.320]  No, I'm just kidding.
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.880]  I don't have no opinions about the Netherlands, although they do feel like,
[23:16.180 --> 23:19.080]  you know, the meme of like we got Taco Bell at home or whatever.
[23:19.240 --> 23:22.880]  Yeah, I feel Netherlands is that to like New Zealand to me,
[23:22.920 --> 23:26.900]  like they're the dollar store New Zealand, probably because they both start with any.
[23:27.100 --> 23:29.980]  And I know nothing about really Netherlands at all.
[23:30.660 --> 23:31.660]  Fifteen point five.
[23:31.660 --> 23:32.980]  I just don't like that number.
[23:33.060 --> 23:34.520]  I'm going. I'm going under.
[23:34.900 --> 23:35.880]  I'm going under on the Netherlands.
[23:36.020 --> 23:37.060]  I think they have a bad time.
[23:37.820 --> 23:39.920]  Under. OK, and Nick, what do you think?
[23:40.480 --> 23:41.880]  I love the country's name.
[23:42.040 --> 23:43.480]  It's so cool. Over.
[23:44.200 --> 23:46.640]  You like the name of the Netherlands?
[23:46.960 --> 23:48.020]  Netherlands is a great. It's a great.
[23:48.380 --> 23:49.760]  It's some spiralized.
[23:50.140 --> 23:51.700]  Yeah, I like it. Yeah.
[23:52.120 --> 23:54.500]  Gavin and I once watched a guy from the Netherlands
[23:54.500 --> 23:58.080]  drink an entire glass boot full of beer
[23:58.080 --> 24:01.480]  and then scream at us to tell all of America about him.
[24:02.120 --> 24:03.060]  And now we have.
[24:03.320 --> 24:05.940]  Yeah, well, my hand is off the piece.
[24:06.200 --> 24:08.800]  Fuck it. You couldn't have told that before, Geoff.
[24:08.920 --> 24:09.760]  Yeah, there we go.
[24:09.800 --> 24:11.020]  That's and that's why we think when.
[24:11.180 --> 24:13.740]  Oh, man. Inherently knew that story.
[24:14.120 --> 24:14.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[24:14.980 --> 24:16.580]  But do you know anyone from Belgium?
[24:16.720 --> 24:19.320]  Because they're looking at three and a half here, Geoff, what do you think?
[24:19.360 --> 24:21.240]  Over under this is a good year for Belgium.
[24:21.320 --> 24:21.880]  I'm taking the over.
[24:22.360 --> 24:23.140]  Over it is.
[24:23.160 --> 24:24.540]  And Gavin, what do you think?
[24:24.560 --> 24:25.420]  Over under three and a half.
[24:25.740 --> 24:28.100]  Oh, well, the chocolate is great, but it's the sports.
[24:28.440 --> 24:29.480]  That's an under for me.
[24:31.060 --> 24:32.020]  Great, Andrew.
[24:32.300 --> 24:33.340]  Over under three and a half.
[24:33.760 --> 24:34.280]  Here's the thing.
[24:34.340 --> 24:35.800]  As Gavin said, chocolate is great.
[24:35.880 --> 24:36.800]  I'm feeling the good vibes.
[24:36.960 --> 24:39.020]  Is the villain from gold member?
[24:39.240 --> 24:41.240]  Is he from Belgium?
[24:41.760 --> 24:42.240]  He's Dutch.
[24:42.420 --> 24:44.460]  Was gold member from belt was Dutch.
[24:44.600 --> 24:45.360]  Is that OK?
[24:45.920 --> 24:47.260]  Yeah. Freaky deaky Dutch.
[24:47.780 --> 24:50.500]  OK, we're going over over all the way over.
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.040]  Oh, I'm liking the vibes.
[24:52.440 --> 24:54.240]  I'm 100 percent chocolate.
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.280]  100 percent metals.
[24:55.800 --> 24:56.720]  They're getting a lot of them.
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.620]  OK, and Nick by Waffles over
[25:01.860 --> 25:05.540]  over, and this will be the first time that me and Andrew agree on one.
[25:05.660 --> 25:06.400]  I'm going over.
[25:06.920 --> 25:11.300]  Yeah, we've been opposite the whole way, but I can't deny.
[25:11.740 --> 25:15.620]  I know I was I was going to make it a bit and take it all the way to the end.
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.860]  But my my want to win is too great.
[25:19.860 --> 25:21.540]  So I cannot do that.
[25:22.500 --> 25:25.020]  So I'll be taking the over as well.
[25:25.020 --> 25:28.960]  And next is Ireland at two and a half.
[25:29.100 --> 25:31.340]  Andrew, how are the vibes about Ireland?
[25:31.760 --> 25:34.600]  Honestly, vibes have maybe never been lower.
[25:34.760 --> 25:36.060]  And that's saying a lot.
[25:36.540 --> 25:37.600]  Vibes are real bad.
[25:38.080 --> 25:41.520]  I have a feeling that the vibes in Ireland probably were lower.
[25:42.580 --> 25:44.060]  Hundred years. Name one time.
[25:44.460 --> 25:45.120]  Name one time.
[25:48.180 --> 25:48.780]  1916.
[25:49.360 --> 25:52.200]  Oh, it's throwing big numbers at me.
[25:52.240 --> 25:53.220]  That doesn't mean anything.
[25:53.220 --> 25:57.720]  Ireland, they're not you two, not in the sphere anymore.
[25:57.920 --> 25:58.640]  That's old news.
[25:58.760 --> 26:00.640]  Nobody even remembers that they were there.
[26:01.080 --> 26:03.080]  Conor McGregor has never looked worse.
[26:03.220 --> 26:03.900]  He's terrible.
[26:04.420 --> 26:06.340]  His legacy is down.
[26:06.820 --> 26:07.720]  Irish people.
[26:07.980 --> 26:11.340]  I think it's been a tough time and it's going to continue to be tough.
[26:11.660 --> 26:12.720]  We're going under on Ireland.
[26:12.980 --> 26:14.280]  Under? Bad vibes.
[26:15.100 --> 26:15.880]  Yeah, I get it.
[26:16.280 --> 26:17.820]  Nick over under two and a half.
[26:18.440 --> 26:21.200]  Oh, I want a real
[26:22.100 --> 26:22.940]  Jameson kick.
[26:23.820 --> 26:24.720]  I'm going to go.
[26:24.720 --> 26:26.100]  Yeah, but remember the potato famine?
[26:26.660 --> 26:27.440]  Think about that.
[26:27.880 --> 26:28.120]  Right.
[26:28.340 --> 26:32.140]  But the vibes were better during the potato famine than they are right now.
[26:32.160 --> 26:33.280]  Yeah. According to Andrew.
[26:33.620 --> 26:36.360]  You see that photo of McGregor and his broken toe?
[26:36.680 --> 26:39.700]  You have moved my chess piece into checkmate.
[26:39.880 --> 26:40.520]  I'm going over.
[26:41.440 --> 26:41.920]  Over.
[26:42.800 --> 26:45.060]  Uh, I'm actually with Andrew on this one.
[26:45.080 --> 26:47.340]  Under it is, I think, the um...
[26:47.340 --> 26:48.560]  I'm glad you and I are in agreement.
[26:48.560 --> 26:52.860]  My reason is mostly I just don't think the Irish are going to perform
[26:52.860 --> 26:55.980]  well in the summer games is just my thinking.
[26:56.900 --> 27:01.720]  You guys, Eric and Andrew are right, but but not for the right reason.
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.080]  I actually have a little bit of inside intel into why Ireland is going to
[27:06.080 --> 27:07.660]  underperform in this Olympics.
[27:07.780 --> 27:09.260]  You can go ahead and put me down as the under.
[27:09.640 --> 27:13.940]  My in-laws, Emily's parents, just spent like 10 days
[27:13.940 --> 27:16.280]  touring the entire country of Ireland,
[27:16.740 --> 27:22.220]  and they had such a good time and had so many stories about how nice and friendly
[27:22.720 --> 27:25.900]  the Irish people were and how they would just sit and talk to you for hours
[27:25.900 --> 27:29.540]  if you wanted to, that I have a feeling the entire country's probably exhausted.
[27:30.200 --> 27:32.220]  Yeah, it sounds like they're overcompensating.
[27:32.340 --> 27:33.280]  They're a little worn out.
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.080]  They rolled out the red carpet to such a degree to my in-laws
[27:37.080 --> 27:40.540]  that they that they probably don't have the stamina in it
[27:40.540 --> 27:42.100]  to win three gold medals.
[27:42.240 --> 27:43.120]  Yeah, I'm taking the under.
[27:43.120 --> 27:47.120]  OK, and Gavin, how do you feel about the Irish?
[27:47.620 --> 27:51.540]  I don't trust a country that can be entirely toured in about 10 days.
[27:51.680 --> 27:52.860]  So I'm going to go under on that one.
[27:55.480 --> 27:57.020]  I've always said that as well.
[27:57.480 --> 27:59.900]  Yeah, I think that is the most diplomatic way you put that.
[27:59.920 --> 28:02.280]  But that's good. Good work, Nick.
[28:02.640 --> 28:05.060]  Your first Germany over under ten and a half.
[28:07.680 --> 28:09.420]  How do I feel about this?
[28:10.120 --> 28:11.000]  I'm going to go back to France.
[28:11.080 --> 28:11.540]  You know what?
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.400]  I'm going to go with the under under under ten and a half.
[28:17.820 --> 28:21.860]  OK, Germany, strict, deliberate, intentional.
[28:22.340 --> 28:25.440]  I think Germany is going to overperform and probably greatly.
[28:25.580 --> 28:27.220]  I think they're going to take home like 14 gold.
[28:27.340 --> 28:28.340]  I think they're going to go crazy.
[28:28.680 --> 28:32.340]  And so I'm going to take Germany as the over on ten and a half.
[28:32.660 --> 28:33.920]  I agree with Eric.
[28:34.380 --> 28:38.740]  When you when I think of Germany, the first word that comes to mind is formidable.
[28:38.740 --> 28:41.940]  I would never bet against them unless they were going up against us.
[28:42.340 --> 28:43.640]  So, yeah, I'm taking me over.
[28:44.160 --> 28:44.860]  Over it is.
[28:45.720 --> 28:46.840]  Gavin, how do you feel about Germany?
[28:47.880 --> 28:48.900]  That's a tough one.
[28:53.280 --> 28:55.000]  I think they're going to just get ten.
[28:55.760 --> 28:56.720]  So under. Oh, wow.
[28:56.980 --> 28:58.160]  Wow. Under it is.
[28:58.520 --> 28:59.460]  Oh, shit. OK, OK.
[29:01.140 --> 29:05.440]  When I think of Germany, I think of high level engineering.
[29:05.580 --> 29:06.540]  I think of good design.
[29:06.820 --> 29:08.060]  I think of the Swiss army knife.
[29:08.060 --> 29:10.080]  I think of Switzerland now.
[29:10.100 --> 29:12.580]  Now, let's go ahead and break that down.
[29:12.700 --> 29:14.400]  Why do you think of the Swiss army knife?
[29:14.780 --> 29:15.860]  I you know what?
[29:15.940 --> 29:17.400]  I know it's a Swiss invention.
[29:17.600 --> 29:22.540]  It's in the name, but it's just really well constructed and it feels Germany.
[29:22.660 --> 29:24.360]  Does it not? Does it not?
[29:24.580 --> 29:25.760]  It feels Swiss to me.
[29:26.660 --> 29:29.440]  Really? I don't think it feels Swiss at all.
[29:29.820 --> 29:32.120]  I think it's mostly much more German.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.960]  You know what? I never factored in the color relation with the flag.
[29:37.040 --> 29:37.740]  That's a good point.
[29:37.740 --> 29:40.300]  Frickin' flag on a...
[29:40.300 --> 29:42.180]  Not all. Well, that's a brand.
[29:42.380 --> 29:45.000]  Can you get Swiss army knives without the flag on it?
[29:45.240 --> 29:47.260]  I just assumed that was the leading brand.
[29:48.700 --> 29:52.880]  This is maybe the craziest thing we've ever recorded.
[29:52.980 --> 29:53.920]  Let me look at it.
[29:53.980 --> 29:54.920]  Since we've done this.
[29:55.340 --> 29:56.720]  Like, this is insane.
[29:57.200 --> 30:00.500]  You start off with a truth like the Germans known for engineering.
[30:00.740 --> 30:04.880]  You can mention, you know, Mercedes, the Swiss army knife.
[30:07.040 --> 30:08.880]  That's the Swiss flag?
[30:10.720 --> 30:11.960]  Swiss flag.
[30:13.340 --> 30:14.760]  Oh, my God.
[30:15.180 --> 30:16.980]  I thought that was a brand logo.
[30:17.280 --> 30:17.920]  I had no idea.
[30:18.840 --> 30:19.800]  That's crazy.
[30:20.340 --> 30:21.160]  That's insane.
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.320]  OK, well, what did the Germans make then?
[30:25.040 --> 30:27.100]  Why did they create an engineering?
[30:28.820 --> 30:30.120]  Did they do toilets?
[30:30.580 --> 30:32.220]  Like doorknob watches?
[30:32.520 --> 30:33.220]  Did they do watches?
[30:33.220 --> 30:35.340]  Oh, my God.
[30:35.380 --> 30:36.440]  Who makes Rolex?
[30:38.840 --> 30:41.560]  I think watches are also claimed by the Swiss, typically.
[30:42.320 --> 30:42.540]  Really?
[30:43.260 --> 30:45.540]  Have I given the Swiss not nearly enough credit?
[30:45.820 --> 30:46.420]  I think so.
[30:46.500 --> 30:50.080]  Well, you have plenty of time later because they're only one half.
[30:50.620 --> 30:51.620]  So, but that's later.
[30:51.620 --> 30:54.200]  Either way, I feel like Germany is very good at things.
[30:54.500 --> 30:55.160]  I'm going to say a word.
[31:01.090 --> 31:01.950]  Oh, shit.
[31:02.030 --> 31:02.590]  That's crazy.
[31:03.890 --> 31:06.490]  Yeah, I've seen that flag so many times that I didn't even know it.
[31:08.310 --> 31:09.590]  Yeah, you thought it was German.
[31:10.510 --> 31:13.450]  Yeah, well, I just I thought it was a solid brand.
[31:13.930 --> 31:16.550]  This might be the most you you've ever been in.
[31:16.890 --> 31:17.830]  Oh, my God.
[31:18.090 --> 31:21.130]  When when people ask me what it's like to work with Andrew,
[31:21.150 --> 31:24.210]  I'm going to make them listen to just your parts of this.
[31:24.290 --> 31:24.910]  Oh, God.
[31:26.610 --> 31:27.010]  Yeah.
[31:27.670 --> 31:29.170]  Oh, what do you think, Andrew?
[31:29.570 --> 31:30.970]  Over, under ten and a half.
[31:32.030 --> 31:32.650]  Oh, God.
[31:32.870 --> 31:33.790]  Wait, am I going first?
[31:34.150 --> 31:35.250]  Oh, I said over. I said over.
[31:35.430 --> 31:37.090]  He said, Oh, OK, got it.
[31:37.090 --> 31:37.590]  OK, cool.
[31:38.810 --> 31:40.490]  Next is I this is
[31:41.230 --> 31:43.070]  another country with a red and white flag.
[31:43.410 --> 31:47.770]  Japan, 19 and a half is their line for gold medals.
[31:48.490 --> 31:52.050]  Japan is a Winter Olympics country to me.
[31:52.250 --> 31:54.150]  And for that reason, I have to put them at under.
[31:54.290 --> 31:56.670]  I don't think that they will crack 15.
[31:57.690 --> 31:58.610]  I'm going to go over.
[31:58.710 --> 32:00.590]  I think they're going to do well in some of the newer sports.
[32:01.150 --> 32:02.610]  Oh, interesting.
[32:02.630 --> 32:04.030]  What new sports are we talking?
[32:04.390 --> 32:06.050]  There's like skateboarding, breakdancing.
[32:06.050 --> 32:06.890]  There's a lot of different.
[32:06.950 --> 32:08.870]  Yeah, a lot of different newer type sports.
[32:09.030 --> 32:10.610]  A lot of like subjective things.
[32:10.830 --> 32:13.690]  Yeah, I think Japan's a young country in general.
[32:13.690 --> 32:17.390]  So I think that they are they're probably more attuned to the newer sports.
[32:17.470 --> 32:20.650]  I think Japan right now has never been older, right?
[32:20.730 --> 32:22.490]  Yeah, it's a it's a it's a mindset.
[32:22.890 --> 32:24.070]  I understand that.
[32:24.070 --> 32:24.910]  But it's a mindset.
[32:25.210 --> 32:26.590]  Oh, OK. OK.
[32:26.770 --> 32:28.210]  They embrace the future.
[32:28.330 --> 32:32.150]  I think even if you're young at heart and or of mind,
[32:32.150 --> 32:34.250]  I think a declining population,
[32:34.550 --> 32:38.610]  an aging population is a declining gold medal count.
[32:38.790 --> 32:39.130]  So under.
[32:40.590 --> 32:41.110]  Interesting.
[32:41.690 --> 32:44.850]  Uh, Andrew, I'm excited to hear about this.
[32:44.970 --> 32:46.150]  What are the vibes like with Japan?
[32:47.890 --> 32:48.510]  Can I?
[32:50.670 --> 32:53.270]  Do you have to look up which one Japan is?
[32:53.630 --> 32:55.370]  No, here's the thing.
[32:56.250 --> 32:59.650]  I opened up my food app and I was going to make a determination
[32:59.650 --> 33:02.150]  based on if a certain restaurant was expected.
[33:02.270 --> 33:03.510]  Jesus Christ.
[33:03.970 --> 33:07.010]  And I'm just scrolling through and it's not there.
[33:07.490 --> 33:10.930]  But there is a place called Kamikaze Sushi, which I think is just
[33:10.930 --> 33:13.110]  cannot be released.
[33:13.430 --> 33:15.270]  We can't release this.
[33:15.610 --> 33:16.970]  It's what they're named.
[33:17.370 --> 33:18.770]  I didn't name them.
[33:19.170 --> 33:21.650]  It's a wild name for a sushi place.
[33:22.970 --> 33:25.030]  Uh, I'm going to say over.
[33:25.210 --> 33:25.770]  We're going over.
[33:25.770 --> 33:27.910]  I think they have a good year.
[33:30.950 --> 33:32.550]  One uncertainty for lunch.
[33:33.610 --> 33:35.750]  I'm looking at this Kamikaze Sushi place.
[33:35.890 --> 33:37.750]  Oh, for fucking Karachi Bowl.
[33:38.230 --> 33:40.490]  What the fuck is going on?
[33:40.590 --> 33:42.030]  This is crazy.
[33:42.330 --> 33:45.750]  But it's time for Nick to say Japan over under.
[33:45.870 --> 33:46.510]  What do you think, bud?
[33:46.710 --> 33:50.530]  Oh, for all those reasons and more.
[33:50.690 --> 33:51.450]  I'm going with the under.
[33:51.730 --> 33:54.110]  I wouldn't I wouldn't want to associate with those reasons.
[33:54.170 --> 33:55.150]  I meant Gavin's.
[33:55.150 --> 33:55.750]  I was talking about.
[33:55.970 --> 33:56.650]  Oh, OK. Yeah.
[33:57.470 --> 33:59.670]  I'm just ignoring what happened before this.
[34:06.570 --> 34:09.450]  OK, New Zealand, three and a half.
[34:09.530 --> 34:10.910]  Geoff, what's your thinking here?
[34:11.730 --> 34:13.850]  Uh, it's off here for them for some reason.
[34:13.930 --> 34:14.950]  They're going to them going under.
[34:15.910 --> 34:17.350]  I don't really know why. Just just instinct.
[34:17.550 --> 34:18.790]  Just a yeah, I'm going with my gut.
[34:19.390 --> 34:21.750]  Yep. And Gavin, what do you think about New Zealand?
[34:26.550 --> 34:28.070]  Oh, it's pretty under there.
[34:28.270 --> 34:29.290]  And it is.
[34:29.530 --> 34:31.410]  It's not even on some of the maps, unfortunately.
[34:31.950 --> 34:33.730]  It's going to be an under for me, I think.
[34:33.770 --> 34:38.770]  OK, Andrew, three three and a half is the line here.
[34:38.990 --> 34:39.510]  What do you think?
[34:40.450 --> 34:41.710]  How many rugby? OK, well,
[34:42.850 --> 34:46.390]  we got male and female rugby, so that's two.
[34:47.750 --> 34:48.510]  Then there's sailing.
[34:49.690 --> 34:51.210]  Sailing is probably three.
[34:52.530 --> 34:53.530]  What's the fourth?
[34:53.630 --> 34:54.570]  What would be the fourth thing?
[34:55.010 --> 34:55.870]  What else are they doing?
[34:57.710 --> 34:58.830]  And they sneak out, hmm.
[34:59.850 --> 35:01.930]  I think they're going to end up with three exactly,
[35:02.050 --> 35:02.970]  so I'm going to take the under.
[35:03.910 --> 35:05.150]  Under it is for me, Andrew.
[35:06.570 --> 35:08.050]  Nick, over under.
[35:09.290 --> 35:13.550]  There are three good Lord of the Rings movies.
[35:14.870 --> 35:17.010]  And three bad Hobbit movies.
[35:17.410 --> 35:19.850]  No, they're not three bad Hobbit movies.
[35:19.850 --> 35:21.490]  There are three bad Hobbit movies.
[35:22.250 --> 35:23.670]  Therefore, they don't hit the four.
[35:24.090 --> 35:24.610]  It is under.
[35:25.330 --> 35:27.130]  OK, I'm going to be the outlier here.
[35:27.230 --> 35:28.030]  I'm going to say over.
[35:28.130 --> 35:29.350]  I think they're going to shock the world
[35:29.350 --> 35:32.710]  in something like weightlifting or something like that,
[35:32.790 --> 35:33.970]  where it's just like out of nowhere.
[35:34.470 --> 35:35.210]  I like that.
[35:35.610 --> 35:37.770]  Like what like what Andrew said, I think is right,
[35:37.790 --> 35:39.010]  where it's like, oh, they're going to get three.
[35:39.210 --> 35:40.790]  And then I think there's going to be one shocker,
[35:40.850 --> 35:41.590]  one out of nowhere.
[35:41.690 --> 35:42.930]  And it's going to be like, oh, fuck.
[35:42.990 --> 35:44.110]  New Zealand, like over performed.
[35:44.210 --> 35:44.970]  They hit the four.
[35:45.550 --> 35:47.570]  So I feel feel good about that over.
[35:49.310 --> 35:53.090]  But the next one is Gavin in Brazil.
[35:53.210 --> 35:56.310]  That would have been the first time we all agreed on one, by the way.
[35:56.470 --> 35:56.910]  Wow.
[35:58.250 --> 36:01.190]  Yeah, I don't I'm not with you guys on that one.
[36:01.750 --> 36:02.710]  It's four wrong people.
[36:02.710 --> 36:05.870]  I just think it's interesting that we've never all agreed on one country.
[36:06.050 --> 36:06.650]  That is interesting.
[36:07.150 --> 36:07.830]  That is interesting.
[36:08.850 --> 36:10.990]  Gavin, seven and a half, Brazil.
[36:11.510 --> 36:14.430]  As you may know, we recently had the summer of 98.
[36:14.730 --> 36:17.450]  When I think of the summer of 98, I think of the World Cup final.
[36:18.130 --> 36:20.290]  With Brazil versus France.
[36:20.790 --> 36:24.610]  So Dan threw in a headbutt and France beat Brazil.
[36:24.810 --> 36:27.130]  So I think Brazil history repeats itself.
[36:27.230 --> 36:29.070]  Summer of 98, under.
[36:29.690 --> 36:30.130]  Wow.
[36:30.710 --> 36:33.430]  Under it is interesting pick.
[36:33.690 --> 36:35.030]  But now it's on to Andrew.
[36:35.150 --> 36:36.790]  Seven and a half, Brazil vibes.
[36:36.850 --> 36:37.330]  What do you think?
[36:38.050 --> 36:41.830]  I think of the film Brazil, the vibes are off in the film Brazil.
[36:42.170 --> 36:44.890]  Not a lot of good vibes in the movie Brazil.
[36:45.210 --> 36:46.170]  I'm going under.
[36:47.970 --> 36:48.570]  Although...
[36:48.570 --> 36:49.750]  Nah, no, no, I'm going under.
[36:49.910 --> 36:50.370]  I'll just...
[36:50.370 --> 36:52.350]  Okay, under it is.
[36:52.510 --> 36:53.990]  Nick, what do you think?
[36:54.270 --> 36:55.250]  You know what?
[36:55.930 --> 36:59.770]  Gavin and Geoff had what could be equated to a Brazilian wax.
[37:00.490 --> 37:05.410]  And that was top tier content.
[37:06.610 --> 37:07.950]  I'm going to say over.
[37:08.610 --> 37:09.770]  Over, okay.
[37:10.470 --> 37:15.670]  I, even though it is a summer Olympics and everything,
[37:15.670 --> 37:20.390]  I just don't believe in Brazil getting eight gold medals.
[37:20.590 --> 37:22.750]  That sounds unreasonable to me.
[37:23.050 --> 37:24.630]  So for that, I will go under.
[37:25.350 --> 37:26.490]  Geoff, what do you think?
[37:26.870 --> 37:28.610]  I think Brazil is going to have a rough Olympics.
[37:28.710 --> 37:29.310]  I'm going to go under.
[37:29.950 --> 37:32.930]  Under, well, we all would have agreed there if it wasn't for Nick, right guys?
[37:33.390 --> 37:34.690]  Yeah, four wrong people.
[37:34.850 --> 37:35.210]  Yeah, see?
[37:35.370 --> 37:37.230]  It feels good to be on that other side, right?
[37:37.230 --> 37:37.930]  It really does.
[37:38.310 --> 37:38.730]  Until we're wrong.
[37:38.730 --> 37:46.170]  Uh, Andrew, Korea, eight and a half golds.
[37:46.470 --> 37:48.450]  What is the Korean vibe right now?
[37:49.490 --> 37:52.290]  Kamikaze, they got yam fries on the menu.
[37:52.310 --> 37:52.950]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[37:53.110 --> 37:57.130]  Which is, I've never seen yam fries on a Japanese restaurant menu.
[37:57.470 --> 38:02.590]  Uh, Korea, um, I'm thinking about Korea right now.
[38:04.270 --> 38:06.330]  It's, there's two Koreas, at least.
[38:06.950 --> 38:08.370]  Yeah, which Korea is this?
[38:08.950 --> 38:12.130]  I think it has to, has to be not the northern one.
[38:12.470 --> 38:13.490]  Yeah, it's South Korea.
[38:13.930 --> 38:14.930]  Has to be South Korea.
[38:14.930 --> 38:16.090]  Well, right, South Korea, then.
[38:17.230 --> 38:20.510]  Well, let's blame them. Blame the Olympics.
[38:21.990 --> 38:26.130]  Because you're throwing some hate at me. I didn't decide how they spent it.
[38:26.910 --> 38:27.530]  What happened?
[38:28.090 --> 38:31.550]  Are they, are they actually, are they different teams or are they just, do they just join?
[38:31.730 --> 38:34.890]  I'm not, I don't think North Korea is involved in the Olympic Games.
[38:35.090 --> 38:38.290]  North, North Korea has participated in the Olympics before. They might.
[38:38.290 --> 38:39.490]  Yeah, they've been in the Olympics.
[38:39.810 --> 38:40.330]  Have they?
[38:40.330 --> 38:43.090]  I mean, if they team up, then I guess, keep it Korea. I just assumed.
[38:43.190 --> 38:43.930]  They do not team up.
[38:43.930 --> 38:45.370]  I don't think they team up.
[38:45.890 --> 38:46.930]  They do not team up.
[38:47.110 --> 38:47.910]  Gavin, I don't get it.
[38:48.170 --> 38:51.330]  Historically, they've been known for not teaming up.
[38:51.350 --> 38:52.310]  Not a chance in hell.
[38:52.310 --> 38:53.950]  I think that's sort of the whole problem.
[38:55.690 --> 39:00.290]  Uh, I'm going to go, I completely don't care, uh, over.
[39:01.250 --> 39:04.570]  Oh, yeah, unlike the rest of these, dude, we care so much about all these other ones.
[39:04.570 --> 39:04.790]  I do.
[39:04.850 --> 39:05.570]  We get to Korea.
[39:05.570 --> 39:07.930]  I do, I don't care about Korea's medal count.
[39:08.290 --> 39:09.090]  I'm going over.
[39:09.770 --> 39:11.010]  Over, okay.
[39:11.790 --> 39:15.090]  Uh, Nick, South Korea or Korea, eight and a half.
[39:15.250 --> 39:16.950]  You know what? I'll go over as well.
[39:17.850 --> 39:18.050]  Over?
[39:18.530 --> 39:20.350]  Yeah, North Korea is in the Olympics.
[39:20.770 --> 39:21.170]  Oh, cool.
[39:21.170 --> 39:23.470]  They're just not included in this 8.5?
[39:23.970 --> 39:27.910]  Well, there are 206 countries. We're just not, uh, we didn't list them all.
[39:28.230 --> 39:31.770]  Yeah, under for South Korea, going under eight and a half.
[39:31.770 --> 39:39.710]  Uh, when I was in the military, the people, the worst duty station to get was a year in
[39:39.710 --> 39:40.490]  South Korea.
[39:41.590 --> 39:47.050]  Uh, people would, people hated to have to go there because the Korean army, they would
[39:47.050 --> 39:49.790]  train with them and they were the toughest people on earth.
[39:50.370 --> 39:53.630]  And people, our soldiers just couldn't hang with the rock.
[39:53.750 --> 39:55.390]  They're called the Rock Army, Republic of Korea Army.
[39:55.750 --> 40:01.110]  And every dude I knew that went there just had the most, like, had superhero stories
[40:01.110 --> 40:05.190]  about how tough the Korean military was and just how much they just revered them and looked
[40:05.190 --> 40:05.570]  up to them.
[40:05.710 --> 40:07.930]  And so I would never bet against the South Koreans.
[40:08.010 --> 40:08.610]  So I'm going to go over.
[40:10.350 --> 40:11.230]  Over, okay.
[40:11.670 --> 40:12.030]  Okay.
[40:12.270 --> 40:15.030]  And, uh, Gavin, Korea.
[40:15.610 --> 40:20.430]  Ooh, I mean, geographically, when, uh, put next to North Korea, it's just under it.
[40:21.050 --> 40:21.810]  So I'm going to go under.
[40:22.210 --> 40:23.070]  Under it is.
[40:23.350 --> 40:24.250]  Good, good pick.
[40:24.770 --> 40:26.730]  Uh, Nick, Hungary.
[40:27.570 --> 40:29.030]  Six and a half for Hungary.
[40:29.270 --> 40:29.970]  That's pretty close.
[40:31.410 --> 40:35.510]  I feel like they're going to go under.
[40:36.450 --> 40:36.950]  Under?
[40:37.110 --> 40:38.150]  Under six and a half.
[40:38.990 --> 40:39.410]  Um.
[40:39.570 --> 40:40.130]  Maybe six.
[40:40.310 --> 40:41.070]  I think.
[40:43.150 --> 40:48.830]  I think they're going to surprise people in stuff like, like traditional, like Greco-Roman
[40:48.830 --> 40:51.870]  wrestling and a lot of, like, the strength-based stuff.
[40:52.050 --> 40:52.810]  So I'm going to go.
[40:52.870 --> 40:54.930]  If they had seven, it wouldn't shock me.
[40:55.210 --> 40:55.990]  I'll go over.
[40:56.610 --> 40:56.830]  Hungary.
[40:57.590 --> 40:59.190]  Uh, I love Hungary.
[40:59.310 --> 41:00.830]  I love the Hungarian people.
[41:00.830 --> 41:03.790]  Shout out to Linda, uh, Gavin, and I miss you.
[41:04.330 --> 41:06.130]  Uh, Budapest, one of the coolest cities on Earth.
[41:06.210 --> 41:11.690]  However, these are, uh, similarly to America, very politically fractious times in, in Hungary
[41:11.690 --> 41:12.250]  right now.
[41:12.490 --> 41:17.930]  And I think it takes a lot of focus away from, uh, the matter at hand and, and is distracting.
[41:18.010 --> 41:18.910]  And so I'm going to go under.
[41:19.830 --> 41:20.730]  Under it is.
[41:20.950 --> 41:22.330]  Gavin, what do you think?
[41:22.850 --> 41:24.070]  Uh, I like Hungary a lot.
[41:24.190 --> 41:26.670]  They have a pretty cool statue of Columbo.
[41:27.170 --> 41:30.370]  I would say like, you know, Columbo was like the underdog of the
[41:30.370 --> 41:31.290]  detective world.
[41:31.650 --> 41:32.210]  So I'm going to go under.
[41:33.350 --> 41:36.030]  Yeah, I would say he's the underdog of the detective world.
[41:36.130 --> 41:36.770]  Yeah, absolutely.
[41:36.970 --> 41:37.850]  I'd also say that.
[41:37.910 --> 41:40.050]  Um, and Andrew.
[41:41.010 --> 41:42.550]  Ham fries on the menu.
[41:42.650 --> 41:44.190]  I'm still processing that.
[41:45.770 --> 41:47.810]  Hungary, 6.5.
[41:47.850 --> 41:48.870]  I think you are hungry.
[41:49.370 --> 41:49.770]  I am.
[41:49.830 --> 41:53.010]  Listen, I'm opening up a box of fruit as we speak.
[41:53.050 --> 41:54.310]  I'm getting a little snack in.
[41:54.630 --> 41:55.570]  Gotta replenish.
[41:56.410 --> 41:57.650]  Uh, I'm going.
[41:58.690 --> 41:59.550]  I'm going under.
[42:00.130 --> 42:00.830]  I'm under.
[42:01.130 --> 42:02.530]  I'm not feeling the vibe.
[42:02.610 --> 42:06.470]  I'm looking at their name and I'm not feeling the vibes right now.
[42:07.030 --> 42:08.170]  How do you feel about the flag?
[42:08.990 --> 42:11.190]  I don't think I could tell you what it looks like.
[42:11.630 --> 42:12.030]  Really?
[42:12.270 --> 42:14.470]  Is it on any products that I may have bought?
[42:16.510 --> 42:17.550]  Is it on a knife?
[42:17.630 --> 42:21.350]  I don't know that there's a lot of stuff that's like made in Hungary.
[42:21.790 --> 42:23.150]  Do you buy a lot of goulash?
[42:27.530 --> 42:27.930]  Goulash?
[42:29.590 --> 42:30.770]  Call of Duty thing?
[42:32.250 --> 42:32.690]  What?
[42:32.850 --> 42:33.890]  Oh my God.
[42:33.970 --> 42:35.230]  You fight in the goulash?
[42:35.370 --> 42:36.010]  Oh, yeah.
[42:39.050 --> 42:40.270]  I don't know what you said.
[42:40.430 --> 42:41.750]  Couple of people swimming around.
[42:44.870 --> 42:46.570]  Are you swimming in the goulash?
[42:48.570 --> 42:50.590]  Oh, they're dropping us a gazpacho.
[42:52.450 --> 42:54.590]  Um, next up is the Czech Republic.
[42:55.310 --> 42:56.270]  Not even the right name.
[42:56.350 --> 42:56.810]  Three and a half.
[42:57.130 --> 42:58.610]  Three and a half is the line.
[42:58.610 --> 43:03.430]  On, uh, I gotta go under.
[43:03.890 --> 43:05.210]  I have to go under three and a half.
[43:05.430 --> 43:11.010]  It's just not, not striking me as a, uh, a strong year, but I guess we'll see.
[43:11.130 --> 43:11.370]  Geoff?
[43:11.810 --> 43:12.970]  I'm going under as well.
[43:13.330 --> 43:14.250]  Just bad vibes.
[43:14.970 --> 43:16.170]  Bad, bad vibes.
[43:16.850 --> 43:17.630]  Bad vibes.
[43:17.830 --> 43:17.990]  Okay.
[43:19.910 --> 43:22.230]  Yeah, they might be the vibe Czech.
[43:23.450 --> 43:23.770]  Oh.
[43:25.350 --> 43:28.050]  Where is this from that it's still Czech Republic?
[43:28.050 --> 43:32.170]  Yeah, I was, you know, it is what it is.
[43:32.250 --> 43:32.630]  It's fine.
[43:32.890 --> 43:34.070]  It's the, uh.
[43:34.410 --> 43:35.270]  Literally isn't.
[43:35.370 --> 43:36.510]  But, uh, I'll go under.
[43:38.270 --> 43:39.490]  There's not even a reason there.
[43:39.550 --> 43:40.930]  You didn't even get cute with it.
[43:43.710 --> 43:47.810]  Now is Czech Republic, are they, are they a fashion nation?
[43:48.630 --> 43:52.250]  When I see Czech Republic, I think fashion for some reason.
[43:52.990 --> 43:53.850]  Is there a reason for that?
[43:53.930 --> 43:56.350]  Is there any thinking as to why that might be?
[43:56.590 --> 43:57.250]  No, I don't.
[43:57.250 --> 43:58.450]  I'm asking the group.
[43:59.010 --> 43:59.670]  Banana Republic.
[43:59.870 --> 44:01.570]  So you think it might be the Banana Republic?
[44:02.290 --> 44:02.730]  Oh, maybe.
[44:03.190 --> 44:04.770]  Maybe that's where I'm getting that from.
[44:06.710 --> 44:08.710]  Uh, I've given a lot of.
[44:09.050 --> 44:10.170]  No, I've been going back and forth.
[44:10.930 --> 44:11.810]  3.5.
[44:12.190 --> 44:14.690]  I can't name like a rugby for the Czech.
[44:15.710 --> 44:17.110]  Uh, I'm going to go under.
[44:17.710 --> 44:19.750]  Star Wars has not been doing good recently.
[44:20.510 --> 44:21.330]  Oh, okay.
[44:21.650 --> 44:21.870]  Cool.
[44:22.230 --> 44:22.530]  Great.
[44:22.770 --> 44:24.070]  Uh, Nick.
[44:24.830 --> 44:26.010]  They're Republic, aren't they?
[44:26.010 --> 44:27.910]  Isn't Star Wars all about Republics?
[44:28.690 --> 44:29.130]  Yes.
[44:29.350 --> 44:29.650]  Yeah.
[44:29.910 --> 44:30.210]  Okay.
[44:30.790 --> 44:31.150]  Yeah.
[44:32.470 --> 44:35.350]  Yeah, those last, those last movies were bad.
[44:36.710 --> 44:37.050]  Uh, under.
[44:37.750 --> 44:38.490]  Let's all.
[44:38.590 --> 44:39.530]  Wow, this is the first time.
[44:39.870 --> 44:40.490]  We're all on under.
[44:41.270 --> 44:41.730]  There it is.
[44:41.790 --> 44:43.850]  We only agree on Czechia.
[44:44.350 --> 44:44.610]  Yeah.
[44:44.750 --> 44:45.050]  Yep.
[44:45.610 --> 44:47.590]  Uh, well, no, we all agree on the Czech Republic.
[44:48.030 --> 44:49.010]  Oh, oh, right.
[44:49.090 --> 44:49.290]  Sorry.
[44:49.550 --> 44:49.770]  Yeah.
[44:49.950 --> 44:50.310]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:50.730 --> 44:51.670]  But, uh, Gavin.
[44:52.310 --> 44:53.250]  I'm sorry, Geoff.
[44:53.310 --> 44:55.550]  It's time for you to, uh, lay out for Poland.
[44:55.550 --> 44:56.310]  What do you think?
[44:57.070 --> 44:57.750]  Two and a half.
[44:58.550 --> 45:00.910]  Not my favorite water, Poland Springs.
[45:01.130 --> 45:03.050]  But I will drink it over a Dasani.
[45:03.690 --> 45:05.350]  And, uh, I would say I enjoy it.
[45:05.430 --> 45:08.110]  And it, it quenches my thirst when I need it to.
[45:08.190 --> 45:09.030]  So I'm feeling pretty good.
[45:09.050 --> 45:09.690]  Gonna go over.
[45:10.510 --> 45:10.930]  Over.
[45:11.290 --> 45:14.750]  You think there's gonna be more than, I think it's gonna be three gold medals.
[45:14.750 --> 45:16.550]  I think they're gonna get three gold medals.
[45:16.830 --> 45:17.190]  Okay.
[45:17.310 --> 45:18.470]  And Gavin, what do you think?
[45:19.170 --> 45:19.550]  Hmm.
[45:19.910 --> 45:22.210]  Well, in German, Po is like your ass.
[45:22.750 --> 45:24.570]  Uh, or your, or your bottom.
[45:24.570 --> 45:25.370]  Yeah.
[45:26.030 --> 45:28.870]  Which is under for that one.
[45:28.950 --> 45:29.230]  Okay.
[45:32.270 --> 45:34.650]  And, uh, Andrew, Poland.
[45:34.830 --> 45:36.810]  Germans made a lot of cars, apparently.
[45:36.970 --> 45:37.930]  That's what I was thinking.
[45:38.190 --> 45:38.710]  Gears.
[45:38.810 --> 45:39.870]  I was thinking that before.
[45:40.090 --> 45:41.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:41.210 --> 45:42.390]  We're talking about Poland now.
[45:42.510 --> 45:43.710]  Yeah, Poland.
[45:44.830 --> 45:46.670]  Uh, it's a tough nation.
[45:46.910 --> 45:48.790]  That's the tough people in Poland.
[45:49.210 --> 45:49.990]  2.5.
[45:50.530 --> 45:53.230]  I gotta assume they got at least one good boxing in them.
[45:53.230 --> 45:54.850]  I feel like they're a boxing country.
[45:55.650 --> 45:57.430]  Um, I don't know that to be true.
[45:57.490 --> 46:00.570]  I'm speculating wildly based off of one MMA fighter.
[46:00.670 --> 46:03.750]  I mean, totally different from the fact space that you've been doing.
[46:07.790 --> 46:09.150]  I'm not going off vibes here.
[46:09.210 --> 46:11.570]  I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm feeling the Polish energy.
[46:11.850 --> 46:14.050]  I feel like sausages are a thing.
[46:14.090 --> 46:15.450]  I like Polish sausage.
[46:15.650 --> 46:16.410]  I think it's a thing.
[46:18.170 --> 46:19.570]  2.5 isn't a lot.
[46:19.970 --> 46:22.870]  I think they, yeah, I think they can do it.
[46:22.870 --> 46:23.810]  I'm going over, I'm going over.
[46:26.490 --> 46:26.870]  Cool.
[46:27.150 --> 46:28.870]  He was just speculating on that one, guys.
[46:29.090 --> 46:29.690]  Uh, Nick.
[46:29.790 --> 46:33.210]  I really wasn't feeling it in the same way I was feeling a lot of the other ones.
[46:34.890 --> 46:35.590]  2.5.
[46:36.610 --> 46:38.470]  That seems so low.
[46:38.870 --> 46:39.530]  I think they can do it.
[46:39.630 --> 46:40.270]  They can squeak it.
[46:40.370 --> 46:40.830]  Let's do it.
[46:40.830 --> 46:41.050]  Over.
[46:41.670 --> 46:41.990]  Okay.
[46:42.290 --> 46:44.490]  And, uh, to me it's too many overs.
[46:44.570 --> 46:45.150]  I gotta go under.
[46:45.450 --> 46:48.130]  It's just, it's not, I don't think so.
[46:48.530 --> 46:51.590]  Uh, but that takes us to Spain.
[46:51.590 --> 46:54.790]  At 4.5, Gavin, how do you feel about Spain in the Spanish?
[46:55.670 --> 46:57.050]  Well, they've been smashing it this year.
[46:57.130 --> 46:58.290]  They won the, uh, the Euros.
[46:58.430 --> 46:59.290]  They won Wimbledon.
[46:59.730 --> 47:03.270]  Um, I think they're pretty knackered from all that.
[47:03.430 --> 47:04.110]  So I'm going to go under.
[47:04.850 --> 47:05.030]  Under.
[47:05.270 --> 47:05.530]  Yeah.
[47:05.650 --> 47:05.830]  Yeah.
[47:05.830 --> 47:06.270]  They're tired.
[47:06.730 --> 47:07.210]  Definitely.
[47:08.170 --> 47:12.490]  Could I, could I say something about Spain that I feel is unfair?
[47:13.230 --> 47:14.910]  I think this is an unfair thing.
[47:15.470 --> 47:21.130]  Movies, when there's a movie, I feel like Spain betrays a lot in movies.
[47:21.650 --> 47:22.910]  Which I don't think is fair.
[47:23.050 --> 47:26.530]  I feel like, I feel like that's an inaccurate portrayal of Spain,
[47:26.610 --> 47:28.830]  but I feel like it's, it's always like a double cross.
[47:29.290 --> 47:30.290]  And Spain is involved.
[47:31.270 --> 47:31.570]  Um.
[47:32.150 --> 47:32.770]  Like what movie?
[47:32.790 --> 47:33.770]  Maybe I'm thinking Zorro.
[47:35.890 --> 47:36.290]  Zorro.
[47:36.770 --> 47:39.290]  Were there, was Spain a villain in Zorro?
[47:39.470 --> 47:40.790]  The Antonio Banderas Zorro?
[47:41.410 --> 47:42.690]  Was Spain a villain?
[47:43.590 --> 47:45.150]  Don't know that we can release this.
[47:45.270 --> 47:47.110]  I'm very excited that we're doing this for us.
[47:47.170 --> 47:49.470]  I just don't know if we can come out for the, for the public.
[47:49.490 --> 47:50.850]  No, this isn't against Spain.
[47:50.850 --> 47:51.950]  I think Spain's great.
[47:52.270 --> 47:53.150]  Spain's fantastic.
[47:53.290 --> 47:54.310]  Yeah, it's the movie's fault.
[47:55.370 --> 47:56.210]  That's what I'm saying.
[47:56.310 --> 47:57.750]  I'm saying an unfair portrayal.
[47:58.550 --> 48:00.270]  Betrayal, betrayal, all of it.
[48:02.610 --> 48:05.410]  Is Zorro Spanish or just, or Mexican?
[48:07.610 --> 48:09.390]  Well, he's betrayed one way or the other.
[48:09.890 --> 48:11.830]  He's not Anthony Hopkins.
[48:12.050 --> 48:12.730]  I know that much.
[48:13.050 --> 48:14.130]  That was old Zorro.
[48:14.990 --> 48:15.250]  Uh-huh.
[48:15.450 --> 48:18.650]  Antonio Banderas, who's now old Zorro as well, unfortunately.
[48:19.130 --> 48:20.130]  They need a new Zorro.
[48:20.130 --> 48:21.550]  Where's Zorro been?
[48:21.830 --> 48:22.930]  They're bringing back everybody.
[48:23.290 --> 48:23.490]  We need a new Zorro.
[48:23.490 --> 48:25.490]  I think we have the right amount of Zorros.
[48:25.610 --> 48:26.330]  We're going over.
[48:26.550 --> 48:27.530]  We need a new Zorro.
[48:27.890 --> 48:29.210]  We're going to get Zorro in here.
[48:29.390 --> 48:30.530]  People are going to get real excited.
[48:31.710 --> 48:33.230]  Nick, Spain, four and a half.
[48:33.590 --> 48:35.290]  Everything's coming up Spain, Eric.
[48:35.490 --> 48:36.310]  We're going over.
[48:36.930 --> 48:39.270]  Yeah, I gotta, I gotta agree with you.
[48:39.390 --> 48:41.190]  They're on the run of a lifetime right now.
[48:41.930 --> 48:43.750]  They are, they're winners.
[48:44.190 --> 48:47.070]  They're kicking tourists out of their country with water guns.
[48:48.430 --> 48:50.030]  I don't really understand.
[48:50.030 --> 48:53.050]  I still don't really understand what's happening or why.
[48:53.650 --> 48:55.210]  But they are doing it.
[48:55.310 --> 48:57.130]  And for that, I will go with the over.
[48:57.430 --> 48:57.730]  Hell yeah.
[48:57.810 --> 49:00.410]  Yeah, Spain is a whole mood right now.
[49:01.510 --> 49:03.030]  They are on a winning streak.
[49:03.090 --> 49:04.030]  It's going to continue.
[49:04.150 --> 49:07.470]  The Sagrada Familia is going to be finished, I think, next year.
[49:07.570 --> 49:07.870]  Hell yeah.
[49:07.910 --> 49:08.890]  Or in 2026.
[49:08.890 --> 49:10.850]  That's been going for like 120 years.
[49:11.210 --> 49:16.610]  I don't, I'm not looking for this ride, this Spain train to stop anytime soon.
[49:16.650 --> 49:17.190]  I take the over.
[49:17.930 --> 49:18.650]  Over it is.
[49:19.350 --> 49:21.470]  That'll take us to...
[49:25.010 --> 49:26.570]  Switzerland at .5.
[49:26.650 --> 49:27.650]  Over, under, Andrew.
[49:28.150 --> 49:29.410]  What do you think about the Swiss Army Knife?
[49:30.070 --> 49:31.630]  I mean, what have they ever accomplished?
[49:32.190 --> 49:32.670]  I'm going under.
[49:32.790 --> 49:34.170]  Well, there's that Swiss Army Knife.
[49:34.750 --> 49:36.370]  Yeah, but that's German engineering for you.
[49:37.310 --> 49:39.450]  So you'll say they're not going to get a single goal.
[49:39.730 --> 49:40.710]  No, I don't feel it.
[49:40.750 --> 49:42.090]  I'm not feeling Switzerland this year.
[49:42.350 --> 49:46.150]  They're too busy making an additional knife onto whatever they're doing.
[49:47.050 --> 49:47.490]  No.
[49:47.490 --> 49:49.710]  You just said that was German engineering.
[49:49.890 --> 49:54.850]  Yeah, well, listen, their greatest invention is German engineering, so I don't know.
[49:55.890 --> 49:56.930]  Good God.
[49:59.750 --> 50:00.850]  So are you under?
[50:01.510 --> 50:02.410]  I said under.
[50:02.890 --> 50:03.470]  Yeah, it's under.
[50:03.590 --> 50:04.130]  He said under.
[50:05.790 --> 50:06.910]  Nick, over or under?
[50:07.190 --> 50:09.330]  They'll at least fall ass backwards into a gold.
[50:09.630 --> 50:10.150]  Over.
[50:11.550 --> 50:13.890]  Okay, I'm actually going under as well.
[50:14.950 --> 50:18.710]  Winter country, not feeling the Samba Olympics, gold for them.
[50:19.010 --> 50:21.630]  Plenty of silvers, lots of bronze, not having it for gold.
[50:22.190 --> 50:22.770]  Yeah, fuck them.
[50:22.830 --> 50:23.110]  Samba.
[50:23.710 --> 50:24.030]  Oh, shit.
[50:24.330 --> 50:25.770]  Yeah, yeah, fuck them.
[50:25.850 --> 50:26.670]  That's what I said.
[50:26.810 --> 50:26.970]  Fuck them.
[50:27.210 --> 50:27.450]  Yeah.
[50:27.790 --> 50:29.730]  Yeah, that's how I felt.
[50:30.050 --> 50:31.290]  As Eric said, yeah, fuck them.
[50:31.770 --> 50:32.110]  Great.
[50:32.330 --> 50:33.950]  And Gavin, how do you feel about the Swiss?
[50:34.490 --> 50:36.610]  Yeah, I'm just going to have to agree with the majority here.
[50:36.670 --> 50:37.590]  I think you guys are onto something.
[50:39.350 --> 50:40.970]  This is such a mess.
[50:41.700 --> 50:44.370]  Uh, next up, Nick, Cuba.
[50:44.970 --> 50:46.070]  Gavin's going to win something.
[50:46.410 --> 50:47.190]  Yeah, right?
[50:47.470 --> 50:48.870]  I think it's an interesting test.
[50:51.710 --> 50:55.250]  I've never had a Cuban cigar and it makes me sad.
[50:55.910 --> 50:56.170]  Under.
[50:59.390 --> 51:02.350]  The reasonings make about as much sense as mine.
[51:02.830 --> 51:04.170]  Yeah, I mean, yeah, really.
[51:04.350 --> 51:06.130]  Uh, Cuba, summer games over.
[51:06.970 --> 51:08.690]  Uh, I feel good.
[51:08.810 --> 51:09.590]  Yeah, Cuba's got it.
[51:10.210 --> 51:10.850]  Three at least.
[51:10.970 --> 51:15.530]  I have had a Cuban cigar and it was pretty good, but I feel like I probably wouldn't
[51:15.530 --> 51:19.170]  have enjoyed it as much as Nick if he'd have had the opportunity and I feel bad about that.
[51:19.230 --> 51:19.990]  So I'm taking the under.
[51:20.110 --> 51:20.910]  Yeah, you know what?
[51:21.090 --> 51:21.590]  It is.
[51:22.010 --> 51:23.570]  Thanks for joining me here.
[51:24.150 --> 51:24.450]  Yeah, man.
[51:24.550 --> 51:24.730]  Cool.
[51:25.050 --> 51:26.470]  Don't worry, you'll have Gavin on your side.
[51:26.570 --> 51:27.230]  Gavin, what do you think?
[51:27.250 --> 51:28.010]  Over or under on Cuba?
[51:28.170 --> 51:28.710]  Two and a half.
[51:29.530 --> 51:29.850]  Ooh.
[51:31.190 --> 51:32.610]  It's right there by Florida, man.
[51:33.270 --> 51:35.030]  I don't think they'll get a single one, you know?
[51:35.190 --> 51:35.730]  I think zero.
[51:35.950 --> 51:36.110]  Wow.
[51:36.430 --> 51:36.750]  Wow.
[51:37.710 --> 51:38.030]  Wow.
[51:38.310 --> 51:38.510]  Wow.
[51:38.670 --> 51:39.250]  Way under.
[51:39.550 --> 51:39.770]  Okay.
[51:40.150 --> 51:40.470]  Jeez.
[51:40.470 --> 51:42.290]  Uh, okay.
[51:42.410 --> 51:45.170]  Andrew, let me let me ask you, what's the vibe?
[51:45.550 --> 51:47.370]  What's the vibe with Cuba right now?
[51:48.070 --> 51:49.270]  They're not in crisis.
[51:49.610 --> 51:51.030]  It's what I'm aware of.
[51:52.610 --> 51:53.590]  Vibes are good.
[51:55.210 --> 51:57.270]  Can't just focus purely on the sport.
[51:57.990 --> 52:00.130]  We have to play a video game after this, dude.
[52:00.210 --> 52:01.490]  We don't want to start with this.
[52:01.510 --> 52:02.150]  We don't want to broadcast after this.
[52:04.130 --> 52:05.050]  I'm going over.
[52:05.570 --> 52:06.270]  I think things are good.
[52:07.070 --> 52:08.810]  I think things are going okay over there.
[52:08.810 --> 52:09.270]  Uh.
[52:10.250 --> 52:10.650]  Uh.
[52:11.750 --> 52:13.010]  Kenya, four and a half.
[52:13.270 --> 52:13.670]  Gold.
[52:14.010 --> 52:14.850]  Starts with me.
[52:18.730 --> 52:19.710]  I'm gonna go over.
[52:20.650 --> 52:21.050]  Uh.
[52:22.030 --> 52:23.610]  I think this is Kenya's year, guys.
[52:24.090 --> 52:25.530]  I think we're gonna see six.
[52:25.590 --> 52:26.450]  I think we're gonna see six gold.
[52:26.450 --> 52:26.790]  Really?
[52:27.530 --> 52:27.810]  Yeah.
[52:27.950 --> 52:28.110]  Wow.
[52:28.110 --> 52:29.190]  I think it's gonna be a big year for Kenya.
[52:29.830 --> 52:29.910]  Yeah.
[52:30.170 --> 52:31.890]  That's an easy over for me as well.
[52:32.310 --> 52:32.610]  Okay.
[52:32.990 --> 52:33.310]  Okay.
[52:33.570 --> 52:35.990]  But Gavin, is it an easy over for you?
[52:36.570 --> 52:36.950]  Ooh.
[52:37.230 --> 52:38.130]  Got a lot of people.
[52:38.130 --> 52:39.310]  A lot of potential there.
[52:41.450 --> 52:42.230]  But, uh.
[52:42.890 --> 52:45.150]  I mean, I saw what the Covenant did to it in Halo 3.
[52:45.350 --> 52:45.730]  Oh, yeah.
[52:45.730 --> 52:46.750]  Halo 2, so.
[52:46.930 --> 52:47.170]  Oh, yeah.
[52:47.450 --> 52:47.670]  Yeah.
[52:49.190 --> 52:49.990]  Oh, fuck.
[52:50.330 --> 52:50.530]  Yeah.
[52:50.710 --> 52:50.950]  So, I guess.
[52:51.550 --> 52:51.770]  Under.
[52:52.450 --> 52:52.810]  Under.
[52:53.010 --> 52:53.270]  Okay.
[52:53.670 --> 52:53.950]  Okay.
[52:54.210 --> 52:54.910]  And, um.
[52:55.210 --> 52:56.270]  Andrew, Kenyan vibes.
[52:56.370 --> 52:56.790]  What are you thinking?
[52:57.230 --> 52:58.050]  Gavin, really.
[52:58.290 --> 52:59.830]  He's the one that pushed me in this direction.
[53:00.030 --> 53:01.430]  Kenyan know what's coming for it.
[53:01.470 --> 53:03.230]  They gotta get going while the going is good.
[53:03.290 --> 53:04.210]  They're gonna be celebrating.
[53:04.350 --> 53:05.530]  They're gonna be playing real hard.
[53:05.610 --> 53:06.150]  They're going over.
[53:06.510 --> 53:07.430]  They're overachieving.
[53:07.430 --> 53:08.750]  Because they know what's coming.
[53:09.110 --> 53:09.390]  Okay.
[53:09.970 --> 53:12.510]  And what's coming is what happened in Halo 2?
[53:12.570 --> 53:13.710]  Yeah, the Covenant invasion.
[53:13.830 --> 53:14.470]  They know it's gonna.
[53:14.710 --> 53:15.090]  Just listen.
[53:15.190 --> 53:16.190]  It's not great for them.
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.210]  Right. And they know it's coming.
[53:18.350 --> 53:19.090]  That's the thing.
[53:19.470 --> 53:21.150]  I, you know, Halo sold very well.
[53:21.230 --> 53:21.950]  I bet you they did.
[53:26.950 --> 53:30.350]  Oh, my God.
[53:30.450 --> 53:33.190]  Thanks for picking 26 countries, by the way, and not 10.
[53:33.650 --> 53:34.190]  Appreciate it.
[53:34.510 --> 53:35.810]  It's 25, doofus.
[53:35.970 --> 53:37.150]  It just, it's down one.
[53:37.430 --> 53:38.970]  Oh, sorry.
[53:39.590 --> 53:40.490]  No, you're right.
[53:40.990 --> 53:41.650]  That was my fault.
[53:43.490 --> 53:44.430]  That's a hard doofus.
[53:44.550 --> 53:47.310]  That might be the hardest doofus I've ever received, to be honest.
[53:47.470 --> 53:50.890]  I got a doofus pie right to the face there.
[53:51.070 --> 53:51.870]  So emphatic.
[53:55.210 --> 53:56.310]  I'll take that over.
[53:57.030 --> 53:58.350]  I'll take that over.
[53:59.130 --> 53:59.490]  Over.
[54:00.430 --> 54:01.390]  Oh, fuck.
[54:01.750 --> 54:03.610]  I can't take my doofus.
[54:07.970 --> 54:08.930]  Oh, Christ.
[54:09.610 --> 54:11.250]  From the German knife guy.
[54:13.290 --> 54:16.470]  I stabbed that German knife right in your back immediately.
[54:18.410 --> 54:20.530]  Romania, Geoff, seven and a half.
[54:20.670 --> 54:21.810]  We're almost there, guys.
[54:21.930 --> 54:26.990]  I feel like Romania is too close to Transylvania, which means that's more of a winter sport,
[54:27.050 --> 54:29.930]  kind of stay away from the sunlight scenario.
[54:30.310 --> 54:32.770]  Too many Draculas, not enough gold medals.
[54:32.950 --> 54:33.730]  I'm going to go under.
[54:34.050 --> 54:35.850]  Under it is Gavin.
[54:35.850 --> 54:39.390]  I mean, Romania, that doesn't even have Rome.
[54:39.510 --> 54:41.670]  If it doesn't have Rome, it's not.
[54:41.910 --> 54:43.270]  Oh, I don't know where I was going with that.
[54:43.630 --> 54:43.670]  Under.
[54:46.790 --> 54:47.170]  Andrew.
[54:48.130 --> 54:50.150]  Andrew, what are the Romanian vibes?
[54:50.610 --> 54:51.990]  We're going under, as Geoff said.
[54:52.130 --> 54:53.070]  Yeah, too many Draculas.
[54:53.370 --> 54:53.610]  We're going under.
[54:53.610 --> 54:56.010]  Okay, Nick, what do you think?
[54:56.170 --> 54:58.310]  Rome has fallen many times and it shall again.
[54:58.530 --> 54:58.750]  Under.
[54:59.550 --> 54:59.930]  Under.
[55:01.030 --> 55:04.150]  Okay, Rome has fallen, but we're talking about Romania.
[55:04.270 --> 55:04.490]  Sure.
[55:04.490 --> 55:05.790]  It's got Rome in the name.
[55:06.450 --> 55:08.610]  That's a way better version of Gavin's aborted joke.
[55:08.630 --> 55:09.050]  Yeah.
[55:10.390 --> 55:11.570]  I got you, Gavin.
[55:11.750 --> 55:13.450]  I'm going to say under as well.
[55:13.550 --> 55:15.390]  We'll keep it all in the family at under.
[55:15.510 --> 55:15.910]  Wow.
[55:16.030 --> 55:17.750]  I know.
[55:18.310 --> 55:19.170]  Two countries left.
[55:19.370 --> 55:20.410]  Gavin, you lead this one.
[55:20.730 --> 55:22.910]  Jamaica at 0.5.
[55:23.010 --> 55:25.470]  Will they get one gold medal at least?
[55:26.550 --> 55:30.290]  You know, I think we're up for a year of silvers for Jamaica, unfortunately.
[55:30.690 --> 55:31.030]  Wow.
[55:31.030 --> 55:31.590]  Wow.
[55:32.330 --> 55:32.870]  Wow.
[55:33.810 --> 55:34.350]  Unbelievable.
[55:34.810 --> 55:35.570]  The disrespect.
[55:36.990 --> 55:42.630]  If you are not cheering for a country that is only expected to win half a medal.
[55:43.750 --> 55:44.670]  You're not living.
[55:44.950 --> 55:45.810]  You're not living life.
[55:46.390 --> 55:47.150]  This isn't over.
[55:47.510 --> 55:50.250]  I want to be cheering for it all Olympics long.
[55:50.670 --> 55:53.450]  I don't even know what this medal could be, but I want it.
[55:53.990 --> 55:54.790]  We're going over.
[55:55.770 --> 55:56.570]  Oh, okay.
[55:58.290 --> 55:59.230]  Over it is.
[55:59.230 --> 56:01.590]  Then, Nick, what do you think?
[56:01.830 --> 56:08.150]  I was blasting the Muppets version of Kokomo on my speaker the other day.
[56:08.290 --> 56:09.050]  I don't.
[56:09.170 --> 56:09.810]  This is okay.
[56:10.030 --> 56:10.170]  What?
[56:11.470 --> 56:12.370]  A rule with Jamaica.
[56:12.970 --> 56:13.230]  All right.
[56:13.450 --> 56:13.850]  Racist.
[56:13.970 --> 56:14.970]  No, no.
[56:15.570 --> 56:16.870]  Ooh, I want to take you.
[56:17.090 --> 56:17.550]  So let's go.
[56:17.650 --> 56:18.050]  Yeah, over.
[56:18.730 --> 56:19.570]  I believe in over.
[56:20.750 --> 56:23.430]  I think 0.5 is such a low line for Jamaica.
[56:23.950 --> 56:25.450]  They've won gold in the past.
[56:25.610 --> 56:26.790]  It's not like it's new to them.
[56:26.890 --> 56:28.730]  I think that they will win at least one.
[56:28.730 --> 56:29.530]  I'm going to take the over.
[56:29.970 --> 56:31.190]  I think they got.
[56:31.590 --> 56:34.650]  I think it's a two or three gold medal year for them.
[56:34.750 --> 56:35.490]  I'm taking the over.
[56:36.050 --> 56:36.350]  Hell yeah.
[56:36.470 --> 56:36.670]  Okay.
[56:36.810 --> 56:38.930]  And I believe in him like John Candy did.
[56:39.670 --> 56:40.590]  Oh, nice.
[56:40.770 --> 56:42.190]  That's a cool runnings, bud.
[56:43.030 --> 56:47.030]  And finally, for some reason, last on this list, Kazakhstan.
[56:47.490 --> 56:49.550]  One and a half gold is the line.
[56:49.670 --> 56:50.990]  Andrew, what do you think?
[56:51.490 --> 56:52.610]  Is New Spain?
[56:53.430 --> 56:54.610]  Was that Mexico?
[56:54.750 --> 56:56.290]  Was Mexico once called New Spain?
[56:57.690 --> 56:57.810]  Yeah.
[56:57.810 --> 56:59.310]  Because you guys had me real panicking.
[56:59.470 --> 57:03.610]  I had to look up the nationality of Zorro, which is apparently a highly googled thing.
[57:04.590 --> 57:08.410]  Says he's from California, New Spain or Mexico.
[57:09.810 --> 57:10.050]  Okay.
[57:10.570 --> 57:10.750]  Okay.
[57:10.950 --> 57:12.190]  Is New Spain part of Mexico?
[57:16.070 --> 57:17.010]  Where's New Spain?
[57:18.930 --> 57:23.030]  Well, it's not in Kazakhstan, the country that you're trying to get gold on.
[57:23.250 --> 57:25.810]  We're going to have so close to the finish line.
[57:26.030 --> 57:28.710]  I feel like Jamaica running as fast as I can.
[57:28.710 --> 57:28.970]  Under.
[57:29.790 --> 57:30.810]  Under it is.
[57:30.870 --> 57:31.230]  Nick?
[57:32.370 --> 57:33.130]  One and a half.
[57:33.190 --> 57:34.230]  I feel like they can do two.
[57:34.450 --> 57:34.970]  Let's go over.
[57:35.690 --> 57:36.010]  Over.
[57:36.250 --> 57:39.310]  I'm also taking the under on this.
[57:40.530 --> 57:41.770]  I just don't think it's happening.
[57:42.130 --> 57:42.630]  What do you think, Geoff?
[57:42.990 --> 57:43.810]  Can I ask a question?
[57:46.510 --> 57:46.830]  Who?
[57:47.490 --> 57:47.990]  I'll take it.
[57:48.030 --> 57:49.690]  Is your silence, is that a yes or no?
[57:49.830 --> 57:52.530]  Oh, we just don't know who the who is, but I'm sure.
[57:52.850 --> 57:53.650]  Yeah, you can ask me.
[57:54.270 --> 57:58.410]  Can, to all of you, does anyone know is MMA in the Olympics?
[57:59.330 --> 57:59.650]  No.
[57:59.810 --> 58:01.170]  Oh, no, it's just boxing.
[58:01.410 --> 58:02.890]  I yeah, I don't think so.
[58:03.230 --> 58:03.990]  All right, I'll take the under.
[58:04.890 --> 58:05.210]  Under.
[58:05.450 --> 58:05.770]  Okay.
[58:06.670 --> 58:09.750]  And Gavin, over under Kazakhstan, one and a half.
[58:10.490 --> 58:14.610]  I feel like honestly, I've been overthinking a lot of these choices and trying to rationalize
[58:14.610 --> 58:15.230]  them a little too much.
[58:15.330 --> 58:15.670]  I agree.
[58:15.770 --> 58:16.610]  Leave this one up to chance.
[58:16.670 --> 58:17.330]  I'm going to roll a dice.
[58:17.470 --> 58:18.850]  If it's odd, I'm just going to go under.
[58:18.910 --> 58:20.390]  If it's even, I'm going to go over.
[58:20.470 --> 58:20.770]  Here we go.
[58:21.010 --> 58:21.250]  Okay.
[58:22.790 --> 58:23.510]  That'll be under.
[58:24.230 --> 58:25.430]  Under it is.
[58:27.170 --> 58:28.450]  This has been...
[58:28.450 --> 58:29.270]  What experiment?
[58:29.550 --> 58:29.750]  Yeah.
[58:29.870 --> 58:31.200]  Guys, would you have...
[58:32.070 --> 58:32.830]  Before we advance.
[58:33.190 --> 58:37.450]  Would you have taken the over on Kazakhstan because of Dagestani fighters, Geoff?
[58:37.850 --> 58:39.170]  Is that where the brain was going?
[58:40.230 --> 58:42.090]  It's not just Dagestani fighters.
[58:42.210 --> 58:45.050]  I feel like that whole area of the world is really good at fighting.
[58:45.650 --> 58:48.390]  I feel like it's Dagestan with like Habib and all.
[58:48.590 --> 58:51.510]  I mean, Dagestan is definitely like the fucking center of it.
[58:51.530 --> 58:52.090]  Yeah, for sure.
[58:52.950 --> 58:54.170]  Tough areas, tough fighters.
[58:54.750 --> 58:57.210]  Tough areas, tough fighters, great drafts.
[58:57.210 --> 58:58.550]  Fucking yam fries.
[58:58.670 --> 58:59.330]  Can you believe that?
[58:59.450 --> 59:00.050]  That's insane.
[59:00.370 --> 59:04.430]  Thank you so much for listening to our Olympic coverage.
[59:05.390 --> 59:08.070]  I'm going to be excited to see.
[59:09.370 --> 59:11.190]  We're providing coverage for the Olympics.
[59:11.310 --> 59:12.410]  I don't know what else to call this.
[59:13.630 --> 59:16.630]  We'll be watching alongside seeing who does what.
[59:16.810 --> 59:20.830]  Someone's getting a medal and that someone is me because I've been feeling the vibes
[59:20.830 --> 59:22.530]  and I feel real good about my whole list.
[59:23.190 --> 59:25.030]  It sucks that Gavin's going to win this thing.
[59:25.190 --> 59:25.350]  Yeah.
[59:25.350 --> 59:26.910]  No, there's no way.
[59:27.350 --> 59:32.970]  Like, like we it's not like there was good thought put into this, but, you know, there
[59:32.970 --> 59:38.970]  was thought it's the thing where like a squid picks the like March Madness and they get like
[59:38.970 --> 59:40.130]  harder than everyone else.
[59:40.230 --> 59:40.790]  You know what I mean?
[59:40.890 --> 59:45.790]  And it's just sort of Gavin just had a plan and we'll see.
[59:46.170 --> 59:47.390]  I played a squid game.
[59:47.690 --> 59:54.170]  Do we do do we do a follow up video after the Olympics or something?
[59:54.170 --> 59:54.750]  Oh, absolutely.
[59:55.070 --> 59:56.350]  Yeah, we'll have to.
[59:56.730 --> 59:57.890]  Yeah, we'll talk about it.
[59:57.950 --> 59:58.050]  Yeah.
[59:58.570 --> 59:58.950]  Okay.
[59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.790]  Let us know.
[01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.550]  Watch like watch this.
[01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:03.610]  You have the lines.
[01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.570]  Make your own picks on your over under the community can put something together and you
[01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:11.570]  guys can see where you stack up against all of our picks.
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:16.550]  Is there someone out there picking over for every single one to counterbalance Gavin?
[01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:17.790]  I did that last Olympics.
[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:19.210]  It went well.
[01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:19.750]  Oh my God.
[01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:21.430]  It went pretty well last time I did that.
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:23.350]  Uh, keep track.
[01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:24.270]  See how we do.
[01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:26.810]  Let us know what you think of these picks.

[01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:42.930]  We've picked the over under on everything and we'll see you next time.
[01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.950]  Bye.
[01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:45.870]  Sorry.
[01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:46.830]  Yeah.
