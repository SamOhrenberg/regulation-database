[00:00.000 --> 00:03.860]  Hell yeah, we're here for poor regulation supplemental.
[00:06.160 --> 00:06.640]  Woohoo!
[00:07.540 --> 00:08.800]  Nick said, hell yeah.
[00:09.220 --> 00:11.520]  And we're going through.
[00:11.980 --> 00:13.220]  So we just did the movie league.
[00:13.420 --> 00:14.560]  OK, that's what we did.
[00:14.980 --> 00:16.080]  And now it's Halloween.
[00:16.800 --> 00:20.340]  And I thought, what better time we're going to rebring that format back.
[00:20.740 --> 00:22.920]  That auction style with a little bit of a wrinkle.
[00:23.260 --> 00:23.740]  Rebring.
[00:25.060 --> 00:25.980]  Is that not a word?
[00:28.840 --> 00:29.320]  Rebring?
[00:29.320 --> 00:30.120]  Rebring.
[00:30.380 --> 00:34.020]  If you've bring something and then someone unbring it, you can rebring it.
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.220]  Did anybody unbring this from you?
[00:36.480 --> 00:37.280]  Oh, I brought it.
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.040]  I unbrought this from him.
[00:39.140 --> 00:40.700]  Yeah. So he is rebringing it.
[00:40.880 --> 00:41.680]  That's OK. That's true.
[00:43.020 --> 00:47.820]  Uh, this is an auction style draft now.
[00:47.900 --> 00:49.780]  But what we're doing is a little bit different.
[00:52.220 --> 00:53.560]  I'm just giving Geoff a moment.
[00:53.820 --> 00:54.500]  Get out of the system.
[00:55.880 --> 00:58.040]  You might have to rebring Geoff into this one.
[00:58.660 --> 01:02.600]  What if bring it to is called rebring it?
[01:02.900 --> 01:04.060]  That would be great, dude.
[01:04.220 --> 01:05.840]  It should have been called rebring it.
[01:06.620 --> 01:07.540]  Rebring it on again.
[01:08.000 --> 01:08.240]  Yeah.
[01:08.440 --> 01:10.300]  Oh, that was it. Yeah, bring it on.
[01:10.940 --> 01:11.340]  OK.
[01:13.960 --> 01:17.400]  So we have our list of films on the left.
[01:19.560 --> 01:20.700]  Are you still need time, Geoff?
[01:20.960 --> 01:23.480]  Still? No, I'm just laughing at Nick laughing at me.
[01:23.740 --> 01:25.880]  Well, he was laughing at you laughing.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.780]  I know. It's become a vicious cycle.
[01:28.320 --> 01:30.020]  I'm laughing because of the peanut butter.
[01:30.160 --> 01:34.660]  Still, that's no peanut butter in this.
[01:34.780 --> 01:37.920]  We have a list of movies on the left.
[01:38.040 --> 01:38.880]  They're horror movies.
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.560]  If we want, we can add to them.
[01:40.620 --> 01:43.560]  There's 100 I pulled from the IGN list of top 100.
[01:43.840 --> 01:47.040]  Then I sprinkled in some at the bottom I thought would be good.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.740]  If we want to add more, we can.
[01:49.020 --> 01:51.320]  How this game is going to work is we are making.
[01:51.620 --> 01:54.540]  You know how like when you get to the store, you get a DVD, like four pack,
[01:54.620 --> 01:55.660]  five pack type thing.
[01:55.660 --> 02:01.820]  We are each as a movie studio making our own five pack.
[02:01.920 --> 02:05.060]  So the people listening to this, when we're done,
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.920]  you can decide which one you would want the most.
[02:09.020 --> 02:10.520]  And that is how we will determine a winner.
[02:10.780 --> 02:16.860]  We all have 98 points to acquire our potential five films.
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.020]  And how this will work, what makes it a little bit different
[02:20.620 --> 02:23.020]  is let's say I'm first to go.
[02:23.020 --> 02:27.000]  I will put a movie up for nomination, for bidding,
[02:27.620 --> 02:31.500]  and then I do not have to bid on it if I don't want to.
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.040]  I am just nominating it.
[02:33.300 --> 02:36.280]  If nobody bids on it, then it's just deleted from the sheet.
[02:36.860 --> 02:38.340]  We get rid of it. Nobody wants it.
[02:38.820 --> 02:42.820]  Wow. Why would you nominate something you're not interested in, though?
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.300]  Let's say if there's a movie I think will go high in demand that I don't want,
[02:47.420 --> 02:50.280]  I can knock down other people's point totals potential.
[02:50.320 --> 02:51.440]  So you're just causing a spend.
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.080]  I'm just causing a spend.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.880]  Yeah. Or maybe I just want it.
[02:55.260 --> 02:59.440]  So and we're only going to have one, two, three, four, five total.
[02:59.720 --> 03:02.540]  You can have a maximum of five. Wow.
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.300]  But you could go under that.
[03:04.880 --> 03:07.820]  Oh, if you blow up all your points without five films. Yeah.
[03:09.980 --> 03:11.380]  Interesting. Very interesting.
[03:12.220 --> 03:13.080]  OK, I'm ready to go.
[03:13.140 --> 03:14.940]  If you or do you guys want to look at the sheet?
[03:14.980 --> 03:18.200]  Is there any movies on this list that you would like to add?
[03:18.340 --> 03:19.560]  Now, here's the thing.
[03:19.560 --> 03:22.120]  Any movies on the list that I would like to add?
[03:22.360 --> 03:25.780]  No. Like re-add? Do I want to re-bring them to the list?
[03:28.300 --> 03:29.480]  Rosemary's Baby is on here.
[03:29.540 --> 03:30.980]  I'd like to re-bring it on here.
[03:32.740 --> 03:36.200]  OK, I, Andrew, I think this is a great list.
[03:36.400 --> 03:37.540]  I think it is comprehensive.
[03:37.880 --> 03:40.260]  I think you did a good job adding some of your own and everything.
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.000]  I want everyone to have the expectation of what we're about to run into,
[03:44.100 --> 03:47.260]  which is horror movie fans who are
[03:47.260 --> 03:52.600]  a terrible, miserable people who are going to be upset about.
[03:53.100 --> 03:53.740]  I stand by that.
[03:53.980 --> 03:57.780]  Who are going to be upset about a movie that didn't make this cut
[03:57.780 --> 03:59.780]  because they watched it on Shudder one time.
[03:59.860 --> 04:02.540]  And they're like, actually, it's that's better than The Exorcist.
[04:02.640 --> 04:04.480]  And that's what we're about to run into.
[04:04.620 --> 04:06.240]  I think your list is fantastic.
[04:06.560 --> 04:10.140]  Are we trying to are we trying to have the list of best movies
[04:10.140 --> 04:11.780]  or just the scariest movies?
[04:11.780 --> 04:14.660]  Like, what are we judging the final five as your studio?
[04:14.660 --> 04:17.020]  You get to define what that list is for you.
[04:17.900 --> 04:20.120]  You pick. Maybe you want to go with
[04:21.300 --> 04:22.840]  horror movies that you think are fun.
[04:23.180 --> 04:25.040]  Maybe you want things you think are really spooky.
[04:25.440 --> 04:26.600]  That is for you to decide.
[04:27.060 --> 04:29.260]  That is your boss. When do we submit our studio names?
[04:29.580 --> 04:34.400]  I think we can go through that right now because we have the order in which we are.
[04:34.620 --> 04:36.000]  Well, order is tough.
[04:36.060 --> 04:39.040]  It's the way we're listed here, which is our standings.
[04:39.140 --> 04:41.540]  And I think that's the way our movie studios should be presented.
[04:41.920 --> 04:45.200]  Andrew, you are at this current time.
[04:45.200 --> 04:48.540]  Yeah. Winning the summer movie auction.
[04:49.340 --> 04:51.340]  So why don't you give us your studio name?
[04:51.720 --> 04:55.240]  I'm going to clear my name out of the top here so I can put it in
[04:55.940 --> 04:59.220]  as the first place team excited to unveil, you know,
[04:59.300 --> 05:01.300]  as a billion dollar unnamed studio.
[05:01.680 --> 05:02.580]  Yeah. Wild decision.
[05:03.180 --> 05:06.740]  I'm excited to reveal my official studio name, which is
[05:08.000 --> 05:09.480]  A24 is my name.
[05:10.160 --> 05:11.200]  Uniquely original.
[05:11.940 --> 05:13.580]  A little bit of a twist.
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.140]  Uh, what's the 24 stand for?
[05:16.600 --> 05:21.520]  Uh, you know, 24 hours because we bring entertainment around the clock.
[05:21.660 --> 05:23.680]  Wow. Yeah.
[05:23.840 --> 05:25.780]  So it's Andrew 24 7.
[05:26.220 --> 05:31.880]  Yeah. A24 is my studio name.
[05:32.440 --> 05:34.700]  Gavin, what is your studio name?
[05:34.740 --> 05:35.820]  A second place.
[05:36.420 --> 05:37.060]  Thanks for asking.
[05:37.160 --> 05:40.560]  My studio name is Lights Camera Clunge.
[05:43.320 --> 05:48.220]  I know what I would expect from that studio as far as you and you and G.
[05:48.460 --> 05:50.620]  Yeah. Is there an E at the end or? Yes.
[05:50.900 --> 05:53.960]  OK, so it's like flung. Yeah, right.
[05:54.340 --> 05:55.700]  But let's get started.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.940]  It's lights, comma, you know, camera.
[05:58.160 --> 05:59.620]  Oh, oh, there's. OK, sorry.
[06:00.800 --> 06:03.360]  Lights, camera, clunge.
[06:03.720 --> 06:06.400]  OK. Oh, now here's the thing.
[06:06.700 --> 06:10.540]  You said A24 and I think we all assumed it was the letter.
[06:11.140 --> 06:13.000]  Nope. A24.
[06:13.900 --> 06:15.740]  I don't want to get sued. Jesus.
[06:16.180 --> 06:20.120]  Oh, oh, oh, got it.
[06:20.320 --> 06:26.000]  Yeah. Geoff, Geoff hates it.
[06:26.260 --> 06:27.460]  This rocks.
[06:27.740 --> 06:29.540]  I'm going to just write my own in because you guys are.
[06:29.740 --> 06:31.080]  Oh, please. Yeah, absolutely.
[06:31.680 --> 06:35.340]  My studio, my billion dollar studio is titled.
[06:36.380 --> 06:38.280]  Well, you're not a billion dollar studio, but continue.
[06:38.280 --> 06:41.380]  It can hear you.
[06:42.120 --> 06:43.680]  OK. Studios.
[06:44.840 --> 06:47.820]  OK, so how did you hear?
[06:48.160 --> 06:50.340]  What a name. Oh, OK.
[06:50.800 --> 06:53.540]  That's pretty good. Oh, can I change my studio name?
[06:53.600 --> 06:55.940]  No, too late. You're already locked in.
[06:56.700 --> 06:59.960]  Nick, you are in fourth in the summer movie draft league.
[07:01.320 --> 07:06.040]  Well, yeah, this production is brought to you by Sauce Boss Studios.
[07:06.040 --> 07:07.540]  Sauce Boss Studios.
[07:07.880 --> 07:09.640]  Pretty good. Spooky name.
[07:10.040 --> 07:14.400]  Yeah. Are you writing it in or am I doing it?
[07:14.940 --> 07:16.180]  I'm not in it.
[07:18.620 --> 07:19.620]  Who's the walrus?
[07:19.740 --> 07:21.780]  Somebody else is just over it. That's cool.
[07:25.480 --> 07:26.600]  My name.
[07:27.040 --> 07:28.000]  Now, here's the thing.
[07:28.220 --> 07:31.660]  Everyone seems like they have it all locked down and everything.
[07:31.660 --> 07:36.140]  However, I am in last in the summer movie draft.
[07:36.320 --> 07:41.700]  And so I had to take outside funding in order to even participate in this.
[07:42.160 --> 07:46.340]  My my studio, what I wanted to call it
[07:46.340 --> 07:50.680]  was absolute best film studio winner.
[07:50.980 --> 07:57.160]  However, because I could not afford to be participating in this,
[07:57.460 --> 08:00.580]  the name of my studio is
[08:07.500 --> 08:08.620]  Zhuaidun Zhuaidianyingjipianchengdesu.
[08:08.760 --> 08:09.220]  So...
[08:09.220 --> 08:09.660]  It falls off the tongue.
[08:10.020 --> 08:11.540]  Yeah. So that is...
[08:11.540 --> 08:15.240]  I'm glad to be here and I'm excited for the summer movie draft league.
[08:15.960 --> 08:18.120]  Absolute best film studio winner.
[08:18.760 --> 08:19.320]  What?
[08:19.740 --> 08:20.080]  OK.
[08:21.100 --> 08:22.540]  Oh, man. OK.
[08:22.900 --> 08:23.560]  Are we ready?
[08:23.880 --> 08:27.060]  Does anyone have questions before we proceed?
[08:27.980 --> 08:29.920]  OK. I'm going to put up a movie.
[08:29.920 --> 08:32.080]  Do you ever think that we're just getting out of hand?
[08:32.580 --> 08:33.020]  Yes.
[08:34.040 --> 08:34.900]  Yeah, pretty much.
[08:34.920 --> 08:36.120]  Which one? Was that the question?
[08:36.280 --> 08:38.320]  Yes. Who? What?
[08:38.880 --> 08:41.180]  Zhuaidun Zhuaidianyingjipianchengdesu.
[08:43.940 --> 08:45.360]  It's going to be the winner today.
[08:45.900 --> 08:49.200]  It was a sigh from Nick because he'd have to include Craig
[08:49.200 --> 08:51.280]  to have what you just did in it.
[08:51.420 --> 08:52.520]  And that's you just...
[08:52.520 --> 08:54.020]  He doesn't show up in Craig.
[08:54.240 --> 08:55.480]  I have to do it from the original.
[08:55.480 --> 08:57.240]  Oh, Nick, I'm sorry.
[08:57.440 --> 08:59.160]  Well, we were all quiet when it happened.
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.460]  Do you want it one more time here?
[09:00.980 --> 09:03.300]  Zhuaidun Zhuaidianyingjipianchengdesu.
[09:03.700 --> 09:04.300]  There you go.
[09:04.320 --> 09:04.740]  Thanks, guys.
[09:04.840 --> 09:06.160]  Thanks for getting that clean. Yeah.
[09:12.850 --> 09:13.930]  I'm going to...
[09:14.590 --> 09:16.270]  I'm going to nominate the first film.
[09:16.550 --> 09:18.650]  OK. I'm starting off with a banger.
[09:19.990 --> 09:21.130]  I'm going Anaconda.
[09:21.410 --> 09:23.270]  Put Anaconda first up for board.
[09:23.970 --> 09:24.690]  One point.
[09:26.230 --> 09:26.670]  Cheers.
[09:27.450 --> 09:28.310]  Yeah, it's all yours, buddy.
[09:28.730 --> 09:29.570]  Got it. Enjoy.
[09:30.100 --> 09:30.630]  Nobody else.
[09:30.870 --> 09:32.570]  Nobody else wants to bid on Anaconda?
[09:33.170 --> 09:33.570]  Not particularly.
[09:33.990 --> 09:34.510]  There you go, man.
[09:35.130 --> 09:36.810]  OK, I'll take that.
[09:37.030 --> 09:39.050]  One point for Anaconda.
[09:39.450 --> 09:40.110]  Are you kidding me?
[09:40.230 --> 09:42.210]  And now and now you have four movies left.
[09:42.990 --> 09:43.270]  Yeah.
[09:43.950 --> 09:48.150]  It's to me, this is definitely less of a points based thing
[09:48.150 --> 09:52.270]  and more of a I only have five things in my roster.
[09:52.950 --> 09:53.570]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[09:54.330 --> 09:55.130]  You nominate a film.
[09:56.730 --> 09:57.730]  Oh, man.
[09:57.730 --> 09:58.030]  What?
[09:59.750 --> 10:02.470]  I will do Blair Witch.
[10:03.010 --> 10:03.890]  Oh, Blair Witch.
[10:04.550 --> 10:06.410]  Yep. Hmm.
[10:06.950 --> 10:07.850]  I have no interest.
[10:08.230 --> 10:09.290]  I'll do five points.
[10:10.650 --> 10:11.370]  Five points.
[10:11.470 --> 10:12.630]  All right. Give it to me.
[10:12.630 --> 10:14.050]  Does anyone else want to bid on Blair Witch?
[10:14.350 --> 10:15.090]  Give it to me.
[10:16.230 --> 10:17.910]  Blair Witch Project. What number is Blair Witch?
[10:19.750 --> 10:20.710]  Seventy four.
[10:21.050 --> 10:22.230]  Seventy eight. Not it. OK.
[10:23.750 --> 10:25.410]  How did you guess?
[10:25.410 --> 10:28.450]  I don't want to screw it away.
[10:28.490 --> 10:30.610]  I just couldn't around that.
[10:33.050 --> 10:35.070]  Everything is everything is a number.
[10:40.690 --> 10:42.250]  Oh, my God.
[10:42.370 --> 10:44.830]  Geoff, Geoff, what's your pick, Geoff?
[10:45.290 --> 10:46.550]  OK, it's my pick.
[10:47.030 --> 10:48.990]  I now need to pick a movie.
[10:49.530 --> 10:53.550]  Yep. The movie that I'm going to pick is The Thing.
[10:53.690 --> 10:55.530]  John Carpenter's The Thing. Is that on here?
[10:55.990 --> 10:56.710]  Yeah, it is.
[10:56.950 --> 11:00.310]  Oh, shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:00.310 --> 11:01.110]  Wait, is it the remake?
[11:01.610 --> 11:02.230]  Time out.
[11:02.830 --> 11:04.990]  Oh, is it because we changed the names up here?
[11:05.010 --> 11:06.390]  Yeah, we we swapped.
[11:09.110 --> 11:10.570]  OK, what's the next nomination?
[11:10.750 --> 11:12.770]  Sorry, it was.
[11:14.170 --> 11:15.390]  What did I say? The Exorcist?
[11:15.570 --> 11:16.450]  The Thing. No, The Thing.
[11:16.650 --> 11:17.610]  The Thing. John Carpenter's The Thing.
[11:18.070 --> 11:18.370]  Seven.
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.440]  Wait, what did you say?
[11:22.660 --> 11:23.540]  You said seven? Seven.
[11:24.100 --> 11:24.380]  Ten.
[11:26.900 --> 11:27.520]  Twenty.
[11:28.080 --> 11:28.580]  Whoa!
[11:29.280 --> 11:30.740]  Twenty from Gavin?
[11:31.280 --> 11:31.880]  Twenty-one.
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.060]  Twenty-one from Nick.
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.060]  Twenty-five from Geoff.
[11:36.080 --> 11:36.940]  Twenty-six.
[11:37.480 --> 11:37.900]  Twenty-seven.
[11:38.620 --> 11:38.800]  OK.
[11:39.280 --> 11:40.040]  Thirty.
[11:43.260 --> 11:45.260]  Thirty-one.
[11:45.440 --> 11:46.300]  Wow.
[11:46.620 --> 11:47.000]  Thirty-two.
[11:47.560 --> 11:47.840]  Thirty-two.
[11:50.740 --> 11:52.740]  Thirty-three.
[11:53.480 --> 11:55.660]  Thirty-four.
[11:56.660 --> 11:57.180]  Oh.
[11:57.400 --> 11:58.540]  Oh, balls.
[11:58.860 --> 11:59.180]  Forty.
[11:59.320 --> 12:00.120]  Oh, fuck.
[12:00.380 --> 12:00.860]  Whoa!
[12:02.000 --> 12:02.760]  Forty-one?
[12:03.740 --> 12:05.160]  Jesus, Nick.
[12:05.980 --> 12:07.180]  Forty-two.
[12:08.020 --> 12:08.460]  Wow.
[12:09.600 --> 12:10.760]  Forty-five.
[12:11.380 --> 12:12.620]  Oh, man.
[12:16.520 --> 12:18.080]  Forty-six.
[12:26.290 --> 12:28.450]  It's one of my favorite movies of all time.
[12:28.550 --> 12:29.490]  I think I have to.
[12:30.050 --> 12:31.350]  It's the best horror movie.
[12:32.150 --> 12:32.510]  Ooh.
[12:32.810 --> 12:33.290]  Fuck.
[12:33.870 --> 12:34.350]  Ooh.
[12:34.430 --> 12:35.090]  Might be too rich.
[12:35.130 --> 12:35.790]  Oh, man.
[12:35.990 --> 12:40.430]  But also, like, I'm looking in the context of my DVD pack, Anaconda and The Thing in
[12:40.430 --> 12:42.330]  the same pack is fucking crazy.
[12:42.590 --> 12:43.190]  That isn't...
[12:43.190 --> 12:43.290]  Yeah.
[12:43.350 --> 12:44.910]  That makes no sense, totally.
[12:45.290 --> 12:46.090]  Fifty-one.
[12:47.070 --> 12:47.550]  Wow.
[12:50.950 --> 12:51.890]  Going once.
[12:52.150 --> 12:53.570]  Oh, jeez.
[12:53.970 --> 12:54.390]  Oh!
[12:59.430 --> 13:01.030]  How does it get good?
[13:01.090 --> 13:04.050]  Every time we start doing this, it's like, I don't really know about this.
[13:04.210 --> 13:06.330]  This happens, and I'm like, this is the best thing we've ever done.
[13:06.510 --> 13:07.210]  This fucking rock.
[13:07.210 --> 13:07.970]  Fifty-three.
[13:08.490 --> 13:09.290]  Oh, my God!
[13:12.550 --> 13:13.910]  I'm having a good time.
[13:14.150 --> 13:15.130]  Having a good time.
[13:15.250 --> 13:15.770]  Fifty-five.
[13:16.430 --> 13:18.210]  Fifty-five to Gavin!
[13:19.010 --> 13:19.430]  Wow.
[13:20.290 --> 13:22.310]  It's the best movie on here.
[13:22.650 --> 13:23.270]  Yeah.
[13:23.470 --> 13:24.150]  Fifty-eight.
[13:24.830 --> 13:26.730]  Oh, my God.
[13:27.190 --> 13:28.050]  Oh, jeez.
[13:29.370 --> 13:30.730]  Having despicable me flashbacks.
[13:34.010 --> 13:35.550]  Fifty-eight going once.
[13:35.730 --> 13:36.010]  Going once.
[13:37.030 --> 13:38.370]  Going twice.
[13:40.490 --> 13:41.630]  Fifty-eight.
[13:42.030 --> 13:42.690]  Woo-hoo!
[13:42.890 --> 13:43.690]  It's sold.
[13:44.530 --> 13:45.070]  Damn.
[13:45.750 --> 13:45.890]  Dude.
[13:47.170 --> 13:47.490]  Damn.
[13:47.630 --> 13:48.390]  Dude.
[13:49.650 --> 13:50.970]  I'm going to be out of this thing.
[13:51.310 --> 13:52.250]  Yeah, no kidding.
[13:52.530 --> 13:53.690]  I'm going to be out of this draft quickly.
[13:54.110 --> 13:54.350]  Yep.
[13:54.650 --> 14:00.350]  You better enjoy Anaconda and the thing, and then probably like Cat People and Carnival of Souls for ten points each.
[14:01.250 --> 14:03.550]  Dude, Cat People is such a dog shit movie.
[14:04.610 --> 14:05.330]  Oh, my God.
[14:05.330 --> 14:06.730]  My mom liked that when I was a kid.
[14:06.810 --> 14:08.110]  It sucks so bad.
[14:08.330 --> 14:09.030]  Oh, man.
[14:09.290 --> 14:10.770]  Okay, who's next to nominate on the board?
[14:12.430 --> 14:13.770]  Nick, what are you thinking?
[14:14.110 --> 14:14.330]  Oh, boy.
[14:14.750 --> 14:15.530]  Holly, you're up.
[14:16.370 --> 14:16.610]  What?
[14:17.170 --> 14:17.330]  Huh?
[14:17.330 --> 14:18.630]  You're the sauce boss.
[14:20.170 --> 14:21.290]  Oh, let's see.
[14:21.470 --> 14:22.090]  How about...
[14:22.090 --> 14:22.650]  I got it, Gavin.
[14:23.370 --> 14:23.750]  Thanks, Geoff.
[14:23.770 --> 14:25.970]  How about number 77, The Cabin in the Woods?
[14:26.550 --> 14:27.310]  Cabin in the Woods.
[14:28.070 --> 14:28.470]  Three.
[14:31.130 --> 14:34.270]  Does have the Charger and Jockey in it from Left 4 Dead 2.
[14:36.210 --> 14:37.310]  So does World War Z.
[14:39.330 --> 14:41.450]  I don't think I want it.
[14:43.310 --> 14:44.370]  I'm getting it for three points?
[14:44.450 --> 14:45.050]  This rocks.
[14:45.310 --> 14:45.730]  This is awesome.
[14:45.730 --> 14:46.350]  Yeah, go for it, man.
[14:46.830 --> 14:47.190]  Dude.
[14:48.030 --> 14:48.630]  There you go.
[14:49.010 --> 14:49.270]  Dude.
[14:49.370 --> 14:49.550]  You're welcome.
[14:49.870 --> 14:50.710]  Here's the thing.
[14:51.070 --> 14:56.630]  I'm really zeroing in on people that read Fangoria Magazine still and have jobs at the mall.
[14:57.110 --> 14:57.810]  This is...
[14:57.810 --> 14:58.690]  I'm going to make...
[14:58.690 --> 14:58.890]  Oh, man.
[14:59.010 --> 14:59.570]  This rocks.
[14:59.930 --> 15:00.470]  This is going to be so cool.
[15:00.470 --> 15:02.850]  Eric has two Woods-based movies in here.
[15:02.870 --> 15:02.950]  It's true.
[15:03.010 --> 15:04.150]  So far, not bad.
[15:04.150 --> 15:05.730]  And they're also next to each other, which is great.
[15:05.910 --> 15:06.790]  But it was three?
[15:07.010 --> 15:07.030]  Yeah.
[15:07.030 --> 15:07.590]  Was that your bid?
[15:07.990 --> 15:08.510]  Yeah, three.
[15:11.630 --> 15:14.350]  I was hoping that would debate, cause a debate.
[15:14.950 --> 15:15.390]  Next!
[15:18.190 --> 15:25.610]  Next, I'm going to pick, on this list, number 72, a more intellectual horror movie.
[15:25.890 --> 15:26.670]  Jacob's Ladder.
[15:27.290 --> 15:28.070]  And I'll start it at one.
[15:28.710 --> 15:29.410]  I'll start it at one.
[15:30.010 --> 15:30.690]  I've seen that.
[15:31.750 --> 15:32.410]  Never seen it.
[15:32.550 --> 15:32.890]  Tim Robbins.
[15:33.770 --> 15:34.210]  Uh...
[15:34.210 --> 15:34.890]  It is...
[15:34.890 --> 15:35.450]  Fuck.
[15:35.870 --> 15:39.350]  I don't want it, but I don't want you to get it for so cheap, so I'll bid...
[15:40.130 --> 15:40.670]  I'll bid.
[15:42.730 --> 15:43.570]  Careful, Geoff.
[15:43.570 --> 15:44.670]  I don't want it.
[15:44.670 --> 15:45.490]  It's a good movie, though.
[15:46.630 --> 15:47.890]  Am I getting Jacob's Ladder for one?
[15:48.090 --> 15:48.610]  This rocks.
[15:48.950 --> 15:48.990]  Two.
[15:49.170 --> 15:49.430]  Oh!
[15:49.850 --> 15:50.010]  Two!
[15:50.110 --> 15:50.550]  Geoff got...
[15:50.550 --> 15:51.870]  Okay, two to Gavin.
[15:52.130 --> 15:52.490]  Three.
[15:52.910 --> 15:53.030]  Oh.
[15:53.930 --> 15:55.490]  You going above three, Gavin?
[15:56.290 --> 15:56.690]  Four.
[15:58.110 --> 15:58.510]  Five.
[15:58.510 --> 15:59.370]  This is a real good film.
[16:00.790 --> 16:01.310]  It's got a little...
[16:01.310 --> 16:01.690]  What is her name?
[16:01.750 --> 16:02.450]  Elizabeth Pena?
[16:04.270 --> 16:04.670]  Six.
[16:04.670 --> 16:05.270]  I've never seen it.
[16:05.490 --> 16:06.530]  I don't really know what I'm bidding for.
[16:06.950 --> 16:08.070]  Nick was six.
[16:08.670 --> 16:09.590]  Do we got a seven?
[16:10.310 --> 16:10.930]  I'll go seven.
[16:12.730 --> 16:13.710]  Eric was seven.
[16:14.450 --> 16:15.130]  That'll do.
[16:15.610 --> 16:16.790]  Nick doesn't want it.
[16:17.230 --> 16:18.170]  Seven going once.
[16:18.470 --> 16:19.330]  I just wanted to make Eric pay more for it.
[16:20.070 --> 16:21.030]  Seven go twice.
[16:22.230 --> 16:23.590]  Seven sold to Eric.
[16:23.590 --> 16:23.990]  I love it.
[16:24.110 --> 16:24.630]  Jacob's Ladder.
[16:24.750 --> 16:24.790]  I love it.
[16:25.490 --> 16:28.110]  I have almost made my whole DVD compilation.
[16:28.510 --> 16:29.930]  I still have 83 points.
[16:30.210 --> 16:32.110]  Yeah, you're just walking around with one big stick for your fist.
[16:32.110 --> 16:34.650]  Andrew has Anaconda and The Thing.
[16:35.290 --> 16:36.330]  39 left.
[16:36.710 --> 16:38.330]  This is great.
[16:38.710 --> 16:40.450]  I'm feeling so good about this list.
[16:40.450 --> 16:42.810]  Honestly, here's the thing.
[16:44.970 --> 16:47.930]  Nick is ready to win this whole thing.
[16:48.130 --> 16:48.870]  This is so great.
[16:51.430 --> 16:53.170]  So I'm back up for nomination?
[16:53.490 --> 16:54.170]  You are!
[16:54.790 --> 16:55.530]  Oh, man.
[16:56.830 --> 16:57.990]  What do I want to pick?
[16:58.290 --> 17:00.270]  I'm just curious what will happen if I do this.
[17:00.570 --> 17:02.250]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me.
[17:02.630 --> 17:03.430]  Oh, wow.
[17:07.270 --> 17:09.710]  I have no interest in bidding on it.
[17:09.710 --> 17:10.870]  I've never seen it.
[17:11.490 --> 17:12.750]  It's a phenomenal film.
[17:13.110 --> 17:15.290]  So now there's some Twin Peaks fans in here.
[17:15.310 --> 17:16.330]  Yeah, it's a phenomenal film.
[17:16.350 --> 17:19.470]  It doesn't fit into what I'm trying to do with my studio, but it is an amazing film.
[17:19.790 --> 17:20.910]  It's got Bowie in it.
[17:21.070 --> 17:22.230]  Now, here's the thing, Geoff.
[17:22.290 --> 17:24.490]  So far, you've done nothing with your studio.
[17:26.170 --> 17:27.770]  He's waiting for the right movies to come along.
[17:28.970 --> 17:31.770]  I got outbid on my initial film that I wanted.
[17:31.850 --> 17:34.250]  I didn't want to pay what y'all wanted to pay for it, so I pivoted.
[17:35.110 --> 17:37.290]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me going away twice.
[17:39.590 --> 17:41.870]  Twin Peaks Firewalk with me is dead.
[17:42.930 --> 17:43.970]  Just strike it out.
[17:44.290 --> 17:44.910]  Get it out of here.
[17:45.550 --> 17:45.970]  Just gone.
[17:47.350 --> 17:47.670]  Okay.
[17:48.390 --> 17:49.170]  No one else can nominate.
[17:49.470 --> 17:50.550]  Whoa, did you just delete it?
[17:51.250 --> 17:51.570]  Yeah.
[17:52.290 --> 17:52.610]  Whoa.
[17:53.130 --> 17:55.230]  I mean, I was just gonna strike it.
[17:55.250 --> 17:57.390]  I was gonna just strike it through, but...
[17:57.390 --> 17:59.390]  Oh, I thought you said get it out of here.
[17:59.490 --> 17:59.850]  Get rid of it.
[17:59.850 --> 18:01.290]  No, I mean, like, bring it back.
[18:03.190 --> 18:04.150]  I'm not gonna rebring it.
[18:04.290 --> 18:04.830]  Rebring it.
[18:05.210 --> 18:06.230]  I need you to rebring it.
[18:06.270 --> 18:06.390]  Hey!
[18:06.870 --> 18:07.990]  Please rebring it.
[18:08.730 --> 18:09.170]  Twin...
[18:12.150 --> 18:13.030]  Twin Peaks.
[18:13.390 --> 18:13.710]  Uh-huh.
[18:15.030 --> 18:17.370]  Are you typing it back instead of undoing it?
[18:17.630 --> 18:18.490]  Why didn't you just undo?
[18:18.890 --> 18:19.570]  I can undo.
[18:20.510 --> 18:21.730]  At this point, no.
[18:21.930 --> 18:23.050]  You can just keep typing.
[18:24.310 --> 18:24.930]  Oh, wait, wait.
[18:25.170 --> 18:26.650]  Undo that, and then undo...
[18:26.650 --> 18:27.110]  There we go.
[18:27.290 --> 18:27.890]  There we go.
[18:30.090 --> 18:30.870]  There you go.
[18:31.110 --> 18:34.090]  That way it's still there, and we know what we've eliminated.
[18:34.410 --> 18:35.550]  And that way we don't go...
[18:35.550 --> 18:36.990]  You did say get it out of there.
[18:38.190 --> 18:39.550]  Doesn't matter, though.
[18:39.890 --> 18:41.170]  Gavin, you're up.
[18:41.270 --> 18:41.490]  I'm up for it.
[18:41.910 --> 18:42.870]  Nominate yours.
[18:43.790 --> 18:44.570]  Aliens.
[18:45.220 --> 18:46.450]  The second one?
[18:47.530 --> 18:48.050]  The second one.
[18:48.070 --> 18:48.330]  Twenty.
[18:48.930 --> 18:50.070]  Twenty-five.
[18:50.690 --> 18:51.550]  Twenty-six.
[18:52.110 --> 18:52.530]  Fifty.
[18:53.110 --> 18:53.350]  Fuck.
[18:53.450 --> 18:53.870]  Wow!
[18:54.430 --> 18:55.010]  Fuck.
[18:55.330 --> 18:56.330]  Fifty-one.
[18:56.730 --> 18:57.790]  Fifty-one.
[18:58.110 --> 18:59.490]  Fifty-two.
[19:00.400 --> 19:01.350]  Gavin with 52.
[19:01.810 --> 19:02.730]  Fifty-three.
[19:02.890 --> 19:03.350]  Sixty.
[19:04.310 --> 19:04.700]  Seventy.
[19:05.550 --> 19:06.030]  Wow!
[19:06.510 --> 19:06.830]  Seventy!
[19:07.270 --> 19:08.930]  Gavin with 70.
[19:11.510 --> 19:12.110]  Eighty.
[19:16.530 --> 19:18.530]  Eric with 80.
[19:19.390 --> 19:20.450]  Go ahead, guys.
[19:21.610 --> 19:22.310]  Oh, okay, 81.
[19:24.510 --> 19:25.570]  I'm fine with that.
[19:26.390 --> 19:27.050]  You're giving it up?
[19:27.550 --> 19:29.910]  Eric with him giving it to 81.
[19:30.770 --> 19:31.790]  Anyone else want to go in?
[19:32.310 --> 19:32.490]  No.
[19:33.310 --> 19:33.490]  No.
[19:34.070 --> 19:34.530]  Okay.
[19:35.030 --> 19:37.630]  Gavin gets Aliens with 81 points.
[19:39.790 --> 19:40.190]  Insane.
[19:41.090 --> 19:41.490]  Pricey.
[19:42.910 --> 19:46.230]  This DVD pack is going to be so cool.
[19:46.450 --> 19:47.930]  People are going to go, he's got Aliens?
[19:48.110 --> 19:48.790]  And then what else?
[19:48.890 --> 19:49.590]  Oh, fuck, man.
[19:49.610 --> 19:50.010]  I don't know.
[19:50.170 --> 19:52.070]  I'm excited for the other lesser-known Alien movies.
[19:52.770 --> 19:56.030]  I've got Aliens and the 1932 edition of The Moment.
[19:57.970 --> 19:59.150]  You like Brendan Fraser?
[19:59.330 --> 20:00.090]  You're going to hate this.
[20:02.030 --> 20:02.990]  Geoff, you're on the board.
[20:02.990 --> 20:05.690]  I would like to nominate for one point.
[20:05.830 --> 20:06.370]  It follows...
[20:09.590 --> 20:09.930]  Two.
[20:10.570 --> 20:11.510]  Five.
[20:12.490 --> 20:12.830]  Six.
[20:14.530 --> 20:15.010]  Seven.
[20:15.730 --> 20:16.510]  Eight.
[20:17.250 --> 20:17.890]  Ten.
[20:18.950 --> 20:19.650]  Eleven.
[20:20.890 --> 20:21.390]  Twelve.
[20:21.610 --> 20:22.610]  Thirteen.
[20:23.890 --> 20:26.490]  That's the worst adding game ever.
[20:26.690 --> 20:27.310]  Fifteen.
[20:27.730 --> 20:28.110]  Twenty.
[20:29.510 --> 20:30.790]  Gavin's out.
[20:31.390 --> 20:31.990]  Seventeen.
[20:31.990 --> 20:34.410]  No, no, we're already at twenty.
[20:35.270 --> 20:35.990]  Twenty-five.
[20:39.830 --> 20:40.550]  Twenty-six.
[20:40.650 --> 20:41.670]  I don't know why you want it so bad.
[20:42.970 --> 20:45.350]  Nothing I'm going for is going to bleed money out of me,
[20:45.370 --> 20:48.390]  so if I have to spend money on this, I just have a theme I'm going with.
[20:48.850 --> 20:49.570]  Twenty-seven.
[20:49.610 --> 20:50.350]  I also have a theme.
[20:50.930 --> 20:51.790]  Okay, thirty.
[20:53.030 --> 20:53.850]  You can have it.
[20:54.690 --> 20:55.250]  Okay, thirty.
[20:55.350 --> 20:55.710]  Wow.
[20:55.810 --> 20:56.830]  You can have it.
[20:57.530 --> 20:58.970]  Thirty for Geoff for It Follows.
[21:00.110 --> 21:01.710]  What number was that, Geoff, on the list?
[21:02.970 --> 21:04.150]  It was number thirty.
[21:05.210 --> 21:05.770]  No, it wasn't.
[21:05.970 --> 21:07.070]  That's just how much I had to pay for it.
[21:07.170 --> 21:07.590]  I don't know.
[21:07.770 --> 21:08.170]  It's your list.
[21:09.950 --> 21:10.650]  Forty-seven.
[21:11.430 --> 21:11.930]  Thank you.
[21:12.810 --> 21:13.270]  Alright, Nick.
[21:13.330 --> 21:14.270]  Next up, Nick.
[21:15.130 --> 21:17.650]  I would like to nominate Alien.
[21:18.010 --> 21:18.310]  One.
[21:19.330 --> 21:19.810]  Five.
[21:20.270 --> 21:20.750]  Forty.
[21:21.730 --> 21:22.210]  Seventeen.
[21:22.850 --> 21:23.330]  Fuck.
[21:24.690 --> 21:25.470]  Eric with forty.
[21:25.910 --> 21:26.130]  Yep.
[21:26.750 --> 21:28.210]  Anyone going above Eric with forty?
[21:29.290 --> 21:29.930]  Going once.
[21:30.650 --> 21:31.830]  Going twice.
[21:32.790 --> 21:35.390]  Sold to Eric with forty points.
[21:36.010 --> 21:38.790]  This DVD set rocks.
[21:39.250 --> 21:41.110]  This is fucking awesome.
[21:41.590 --> 21:45.150]  This is so good and I only need one more movie.
[21:45.730 --> 21:46.630]  Oh my god.
[21:47.090 --> 21:47.950]  This is awesome.
[21:48.570 --> 21:51.870]  I don't like that you're just going to be walking around with forty-three.
[21:52.350 --> 21:53.070]  I've got four.
[21:53.170 --> 21:54.210]  I have so much.
[21:54.370 --> 21:58.470]  Gavin needs four more movies and has seventeen to spend.
[21:59.210 --> 22:01.470]  You have thirty-nine and need three.
[22:01.630 --> 22:03.810]  I have forty-three points to spend on one more.
[22:03.890 --> 22:05.170]  I feel so good about this.
[22:05.370 --> 22:05.990]  Oh my god.
[22:06.050 --> 22:06.990]  And they're good too.
[22:07.570 --> 22:08.470]  I feel great.
[22:08.910 --> 22:09.570]  Oh my god.
[22:09.690 --> 22:11.810]  Nick has ninety-eight points and needs five movies.
[22:12.750 --> 22:15.250]  Let me tell you, it's all working out perfectly.
[22:15.550 --> 22:16.790]  Oh, that's great.
[22:17.070 --> 22:18.270]  It's all coming together.
[22:18.790 --> 22:23.970]  I'm going to go with number one-fifteen, Cloverfield.
[22:24.790 --> 22:25.310]  One.
[22:25.950 --> 22:26.470]  Two.
[22:29.790 --> 22:30.950]  Two going one.
[22:31.990 --> 22:33.130]  I don't want it.
[22:33.470 --> 22:34.550]  You said two.
[22:35.430 --> 22:36.210]  I did.
[22:36.530 --> 22:37.250]  Two going two.
[22:40.050 --> 22:42.050]  Sold to Nick for two points.
[22:43.350 --> 22:46.190]  Guys, this is going perfectly for Nick.
[22:46.750 --> 22:48.410]  Did you want Cloverfield?
[22:49.550 --> 22:50.610]  No, it's going pretty well now.
[22:50.710 --> 22:51.550]  It was going perfectly.
[22:51.690 --> 22:52.470]  Now it's going pretty well.
[22:57.490 --> 22:58.070]  It's all right.
[22:58.150 --> 22:58.610]  We're going to pivot.
[22:58.790 --> 22:59.130]  Here we go.
[23:00.070 --> 23:01.430]  I like Cloverfield a lot.
[23:01.550 --> 23:02.610]  I just, yeah, I don't know.
[23:03.290 --> 23:04.790]  Yeah, I just don't want it on my DVD pack.
[23:04.810 --> 23:05.370]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:05.570 --> 23:06.110]  I don't either.
[23:08.230 --> 23:09.950]  And yet you put two down.
[23:10.450 --> 23:11.450]  Well, let's be honest.
[23:11.470 --> 23:12.750]  I was trying to drive up the price.
[23:12.970 --> 23:13.550]  You did.
[23:13.690 --> 23:15.050]  You drove it all the way up to two.
[23:15.490 --> 23:17.290]  I was negotiating in bad faith.
[23:19.550 --> 23:20.270]  Oh man.
[23:20.450 --> 23:20.710]  Okay.
[23:20.790 --> 23:21.910]  What do I want to nominate?
[23:21.910 --> 23:22.010]  Okay.
[23:22.330 --> 23:26.130]  A lot of good movies on this list.
[23:27.910 --> 23:31.490]  I am going to nominate...
[23:31.490 --> 23:32.230]  God damn it.
[23:32.390 --> 23:33.350]  Train to Busan.
[23:34.270 --> 23:35.070]  One point.
[23:35.930 --> 23:36.270]  Two.
[23:37.210 --> 23:37.970]  Three.
[23:38.630 --> 23:39.230]  Four.
[23:40.170 --> 23:40.930]  Five.
[23:41.510 --> 23:41.970]  Ten.
[23:43.090 --> 23:43.810]  Eleven.
[23:44.910 --> 23:45.490]  Twelve.
[23:47.450 --> 23:49.150]  I think that's it for me.
[23:50.190 --> 23:51.850]  I'm not putting any other bids in.
[23:51.930 --> 23:52.610]  Is anyone else?
[23:53.190 --> 23:54.270]  Train to Busan going once?
[23:58.190 --> 23:58.630]  Twice?
[24:00.590 --> 24:02.730]  Sold to Nick for 12 points.
[24:02.730 --> 24:02.850]  Nick for 12.
[24:03.290 --> 24:04.290]  Is that good, Nick?
[24:04.330 --> 24:05.010]  Is that what you wanted?
[24:05.410 --> 24:06.310]  It is what I wanted.
[24:06.410 --> 24:06.750]  Great movie.
[24:07.110 --> 24:08.290]  Still going pretty well, is it?
[24:08.910 --> 24:09.930]  We're back on track.
[24:13.250 --> 24:14.350]  Back on track.
[24:14.450 --> 24:15.450]  We fired the first guy.
[24:15.590 --> 24:16.330]  Back on track.
[24:17.030 --> 24:17.270]  Okay.
[24:18.550 --> 24:19.950]  Gavin, it's your nomination.
[24:21.730 --> 24:23.270]  I'm going to pick Ringu.
[24:26.650 --> 24:27.170]  57.
[24:28.470 --> 24:29.610]  That's a good one.
[24:31.810 --> 24:32.070]  One.
[24:33.630 --> 24:34.550]  You won it.
[24:36.650 --> 24:37.430]  You won it?
[24:37.570 --> 24:38.450]  You want to throw a number in there?
[24:39.290 --> 24:40.690]  I think I learned my lesson.
[24:41.990 --> 24:43.810]  I think I learned from my mistake.
[24:44.530 --> 24:46.090]  Okay, with one going once.
[24:47.390 --> 24:47.910]  Twice.
[24:49.350 --> 24:51.450]  Sold to Gavin for one point.
[24:51.910 --> 24:52.190]  Ringu.
[24:52.890 --> 24:53.410]  Sick.
[24:54.530 --> 24:54.890]  Nice.
[24:55.090 --> 24:56.170]  It's supposed to be terrifying.
[24:56.270 --> 24:56.890]  Never seen it.
[24:57.390 --> 24:58.010]  Very good.
[24:58.730 --> 24:59.930]  Better than the American version.
[25:00.250 --> 25:01.630]  It is definitely better than the American one.
[25:02.250 --> 25:08.530]  I'm interested in what they'll do with the next American version because they literally ended the world with the last film.
[25:09.410 --> 25:10.690]  How many Ring films are there?
[25:11.150 --> 25:12.490]  At least three.
[25:12.510 --> 25:13.430]  Three, I think, right?
[25:13.870 --> 25:14.230]  Really?
[25:14.390 --> 25:15.230]  I thought there was two.
[25:15.230 --> 25:19.310]  No, they did one with Johnny Galecki a few years ago.
[25:21.290 --> 25:22.410]  It's not good.
[25:23.250 --> 25:24.370]  Real bad Ring movie.
[25:25.090 --> 25:26.010]  Next up is Geoff.
[25:27.470 --> 25:29.330]  I'm going to nominate Barbarian.
[25:30.990 --> 25:32.910]  I still haven't seen it.
[25:33.190 --> 25:33.850]  Very good.
[25:34.930 --> 25:37.110]  I'll put four down on Barbarian.
[25:37.590 --> 25:38.430]  I'll do five.
[25:39.110 --> 25:39.510]  Damn.
[25:40.490 --> 25:41.210]  Six.
[25:42.310 --> 25:43.030]  Seven.
[25:45.710 --> 25:46.070]  Eight.
[25:47.470 --> 25:48.190]  Okay, nine.
[25:50.270 --> 25:50.990]  He's like...
[25:50.990 --> 25:52.730]  You upset?
[25:53.310 --> 25:54.070]  He's so annoyed.
[25:54.390 --> 25:55.810]  The idea of being so annoyed.
[25:55.890 --> 25:57.710]  It's like Gavin gets every fucking movie he wants.
[25:57.790 --> 25:59.050]  Everybody else gets a movie for one.
[25:59.170 --> 26:01.390]  I have one movie that nobody really wants.
[26:01.490 --> 26:02.350]  I really like Barbarian.
[26:02.930 --> 26:03.550]  Even though I have it.
[26:03.590 --> 26:04.970]  Then you should have fucking picked it.
[26:10.570 --> 26:11.470]  I'll let you have it.
[26:11.590 --> 26:12.170]  No, it's fine.
[26:12.230 --> 26:12.850]  I'll let you have it.
[26:12.870 --> 26:13.610]  No, where are we at?
[26:13.910 --> 26:14.670]  You got to put nine.
[26:15.210 --> 26:16.090]  Okay, I'll take it.
[26:17.390 --> 26:18.730]  Geoff's taking it for nine.
[26:18.890 --> 26:20.810]  Is this how negotiations work?
[26:21.930 --> 26:23.670]  Hey, I got it for cheaper than I would have.
[26:24.050 --> 26:25.510]  Not the way I tried it.
[26:27.750 --> 26:29.190]  You just scared everyone off.
[26:31.850 --> 26:33.470]  Barbarian sold to Geoff for nine.
[26:37.430 --> 26:39.450]  You're going to let me buy this or I'm going to kick your ass.
[26:41.630 --> 26:42.370]  Holy shit.
[26:42.370 --> 26:43.730]  That'd be the best studio ever.
[26:45.210 --> 26:45.630]  Nick.
[26:46.670 --> 26:50.490]  I'm going to nominate It 2017.
[26:51.990 --> 26:52.830]  Very popular.
[26:53.070 --> 26:53.990]  Don't want it at all.
[26:54.310 --> 26:55.030]  Zero interest.
[26:56.170 --> 26:56.930]  I didn't like those movies.
[26:57.670 --> 26:58.270]  Minus one.
[26:59.150 --> 27:01.570]  You want points back and you want it to go away.
[27:03.750 --> 27:05.470]  If you're trying to get back up to 17.
[27:06.730 --> 27:08.450]  Anyone going to bid on It 2017?
[27:09.270 --> 27:09.690]  No.
[27:10.430 --> 27:10.790]  No.
[27:11.370 --> 27:12.170]  Okay, get rid of it.
[27:12.330 --> 27:12.670]  It's dead.
[27:12.670 --> 27:13.670]  Not even Geoff.
[27:14.350 --> 27:15.630]  It doesn't fit in with what I'm doing.
[27:17.230 --> 27:23.070]  Okay, I'm going to throw one out there and see if it lands in what Geoff is trying to do.
[27:24.530 --> 27:26.150]  I'm going to go with...
[27:26.150 --> 27:26.910]  Oh, where did it...
[27:26.910 --> 27:28.810]  I'm trying to find what number it ended up at.
[27:28.870 --> 27:29.790]  Hang on just a second.
[27:30.090 --> 27:30.670]  It is...
[27:34.290 --> 27:36.330]  It's Scanners at number 36.
[27:37.190 --> 27:38.830]  The one with the bloke's head goes...
[27:38.830 --> 27:39.870]  It does.
[27:40.250 --> 27:40.890]  That's It.
[27:41.810 --> 27:42.170]  One.
[27:45.490 --> 27:47.730]  I have zero interest. I'm not bidding on Scanners.
[27:48.370 --> 27:48.910]  Yeah, I'm good.
[27:49.850 --> 27:50.690]  Don't know what it is.
[27:51.030 --> 27:51.530]  There you go.
[27:51.970 --> 27:54.970]  Yeah, Gavin has it at one. We don't even need to really deliberate on that one.
[27:55.230 --> 27:55.750]  Gavin, congrats.
[27:56.190 --> 27:58.750]  I need these ones when I've got 15 points.
[27:58.770 --> 28:00.010]  Hey, I was going to say...
[28:00.010 --> 28:02.370]  Honestly, your lineup, not bad.
[28:02.550 --> 28:03.990]  Scanners, like...
[28:03.990 --> 28:06.450]  I feel like Scanners is one that people have...
[28:06.450 --> 28:07.890]  They know of, but haven't seen yet.
[28:07.930 --> 28:10.130]  So maybe that'll make them want to get this box.
[28:10.130 --> 28:14.470]  You got the DVD cover of the guy's head exploding on your pack of five.
[28:15.030 --> 28:15.450]  Not bad.
[28:16.190 --> 28:16.630]  Not too bad.
[28:16.690 --> 28:19.450]  Lights, camera, clunge, coming to the movie auction saying,
[28:19.610 --> 28:22.750]  Is this the one where the head blows and then buying the rights to it?
[28:23.570 --> 28:25.290]  Not knowing anything else about it.
[28:25.650 --> 28:25.810]  Yep.
[28:25.990 --> 28:27.490]  Well, that's what the last movie auction was.
[28:27.690 --> 28:28.810]  I don't know what the hell...
[28:28.810 --> 28:29.510]  What was it?
[28:29.830 --> 28:30.210]  The...
[28:30.210 --> 28:30.330]  What?
[28:30.850 --> 28:31.290]  What?
[28:32.030 --> 28:33.430]  I can't remember the name of the film.
[28:34.470 --> 28:35.470]  Horizon, that was it.
[28:36.730 --> 28:37.390]  I got pushed.
[28:38.130 --> 28:38.570]  Andrew!
[28:38.570 --> 28:40.210]  Andrew, you're next.
[28:41.030 --> 28:42.790]  I am next.
[28:43.050 --> 28:46.590]  I'm going to put out, I think, a big horror movie.
[28:46.790 --> 28:48.370]  I think could get a lot of action.
[28:48.810 --> 28:49.670]  Evil Dead 2.
[28:50.490 --> 28:52.330]  Are there multiple Evil Deads on there?
[28:52.890 --> 28:53.270]  Yes.
[28:53.870 --> 28:55.310]  I saw Army of Darkness, for sure.
[28:55.910 --> 28:58.270]  I think Evil Dead 1, 2, and Army of Darkness.
[28:58.830 --> 29:00.350]  I believe are on the list.
[29:03.630 --> 29:05.430]  It may just be Evil Dead 2.
[29:05.710 --> 29:06.830]  Nope, the Evil Dead is there.
[29:06.830 --> 29:09.830]  But I'm nominating Evil Dead 2.
[29:09.830 --> 29:10.010]  Evil Dead 2.
[29:10.690 --> 29:12.010]  Funniest horror movie ever made.
[29:12.990 --> 29:14.570]  Anyone want to bid on Evil Dead 2?
[29:15.030 --> 29:16.210]  I'll bid 10 on it.
[29:17.410 --> 29:18.330]  Geoff with 10.
[29:18.850 --> 29:19.810]  Going once.
[29:21.410 --> 29:22.750]  Geoff with 10.
[29:23.570 --> 29:24.610]  Going twice.
[29:25.410 --> 29:27.150]  Oh, I just thought of one that's not actually on the list.
[29:28.010 --> 29:28.310]  Same.
[29:29.070 --> 29:29.830]  I got a couple.
[29:30.050 --> 29:31.130]  Sold to Geoff.
[29:32.010 --> 29:32.630]  10 points.
[29:33.450 --> 29:34.050]  Evil Dead 2.
[29:36.330 --> 29:37.970]  And this still fits with what you're doing?
[29:38.530 --> 29:39.250]  It does, absolutely.
[29:39.570 --> 29:39.770]  Okay.
[29:40.410 --> 29:40.810]  Interesting.
[29:41.530 --> 29:42.930]  Well, next up is Gavin.
[29:43.270 --> 29:44.010]  Gavin, what do you think?
[29:44.630 --> 29:46.070]  Ooh, let's see.
[29:46.330 --> 29:47.410]  Let's see, shall we?
[29:49.470 --> 29:49.970]  Jaws.
[29:50.630 --> 29:51.130]  What?
[29:51.410 --> 29:51.470]  What?
[29:51.810 --> 29:52.210]  Jaws.
[29:52.810 --> 29:53.310]  Jaws?
[29:53.730 --> 29:54.230]  Yeah.
[29:54.410 --> 29:54.870]  Jaws.
[29:59.770 --> 30:00.770]  I'll put...
[30:00.770 --> 30:01.410]  Oh, fuck.
[30:01.490 --> 30:02.670]  Do I want to put anything on it?
[30:02.670 --> 30:07.070]  It's getting to a weird point with this, where the points feel like they really matter.
[30:07.750 --> 30:09.150]  I love Jaws.
[30:09.570 --> 30:13.190]  Do I want it in my DVD pack of Halloween horror?
[30:14.570 --> 30:16.470]  I don't think I do.
[30:17.610 --> 30:19.310]  I don't think I'm going to bid on it.
[30:19.690 --> 30:21.690]  Gavin's getting Jaws at one?
[30:25.210 --> 30:26.730]  It's really good.
[30:27.570 --> 30:29.690]  Did you put a $1 bid down, Gavin, on that?
[30:30.630 --> 30:30.850]  Yeah.
[30:31.370 --> 30:33.170]  When I said one just then.
[30:36.550 --> 30:38.270]  Jaws for one going once.
[30:41.130 --> 30:43.210]  Jaws for one going twice.
[30:46.230 --> 30:46.750]  Sold.
[30:46.830 --> 30:47.730]  Gavin Jaws, Gavin.
[30:48.610 --> 30:53.230]  I can't believe I've spent three on my last three movies.
[30:53.570 --> 30:55.870]  You scarred me, man. You scarred me.
[30:56.850 --> 30:58.910]  Yeah, you made Nick real gun-shy.
[30:59.150 --> 31:00.430]  I'm real paranoid, man.
[31:03.150 --> 31:05.010]  Next up is Geoff.
[31:07.670 --> 31:12.590]  Okay, I am going to nominate the original Evil Dead.
[31:13.070 --> 31:13.950]  The Evil Dead.
[31:14.250 --> 31:15.270]  The Evil Dead.
[31:16.150 --> 31:20.310]  I have zero interest in bidding on it. Does anyone want to put a bid on the Evil Dead?
[31:22.970 --> 31:25.730]  I'll put a bid for one. Sorry, it's for me, but one for me.
[31:27.010 --> 31:28.430]  Geoff with one.
[31:29.930 --> 31:31.490]  Geoff with one going once.
[31:33.630 --> 31:35.710]  Geoff with one going twice.
[31:35.870 --> 31:36.270]  Two!
[31:38.310 --> 31:39.250]  Big bid.
[31:39.330 --> 31:40.470]  We're in a bidding war.
[31:40.910 --> 31:42.670]  Big old bid from Nick.
[31:42.990 --> 31:44.150]  I'll go up to three.
[31:45.210 --> 31:45.850]  Four.
[31:46.370 --> 31:47.490]  Oh, Nick with four.
[31:48.010 --> 31:48.950]  Nick with four.
[31:51.310 --> 31:51.950]  Six.
[31:53.310 --> 31:54.790]  Geoff with six.
[31:57.370 --> 31:58.330]  Going once.
[32:00.490 --> 32:00.970]  Twice.
[32:02.010 --> 32:03.070]  I'm done, your honor.
[32:03.790 --> 32:06.650]  Sold to Geoff for six points.
[32:07.050 --> 32:08.890]  You didn't even have to get yelled at, Nick.
[32:10.570 --> 32:11.050]  Yeah.
[32:11.290 --> 32:12.270]  It would have gotten there.
[32:13.470 --> 32:15.490]  Did you say it would have gotten there?
[32:15.670 --> 32:16.730]  We would have gotten there, yeah.
[32:17.910 --> 32:19.870]  What was your yelling number, Geoff?
[32:20.210 --> 32:22.590]  Oh, I don't know. Anything after probably 12.
[32:23.890 --> 32:25.630]  This is ridiculous.
[32:26.990 --> 32:34.010]  I like the idea of like an auction where your paddles are going up back and forth and you're just looking at the other person going, what the fuck are you doing?
[32:34.190 --> 32:36.250]  And just keeping raising your own bid.
[32:37.730 --> 32:38.950]  Next up, we got Nick.
[32:39.090 --> 32:39.810]  Nick, what do you think?
[32:41.270 --> 32:43.510]  Number 81, 28 days later.
[32:45.270 --> 32:46.190]  Great movie.
[32:47.350 --> 32:50.010]  Long awaited third part coming out soon.
[32:51.150 --> 32:52.950]  Oh, boy.
[32:54.670 --> 32:56.790]  I'll put one down.
[32:58.090 --> 32:59.070]  28 days later.
[32:59.570 --> 33:00.310]  I'll do two.
[33:01.470 --> 33:02.450]  Too rich for my blood.
[33:04.010 --> 33:05.890]  That's how you drive the price up, Nick.
[33:08.330 --> 33:10.010]  It's all coming together.
[33:10.590 --> 33:11.350]  Okay.
[33:12.670 --> 33:15.170]  28 days later. Anyone else?
[33:15.870 --> 33:17.330]  Going to Nick for two points?
[33:18.570 --> 33:18.950]  Okay.
[33:19.750 --> 33:20.570]  To Nick.
[33:21.730 --> 33:30.330]  Okay, I got my next one. I'm going to go with number 101, The Shining.
[33:34.910 --> 33:35.390]  14.
[33:35.990 --> 33:36.830]  15.
[33:38.830 --> 33:39.310]  16.
[33:39.310 --> 33:42.110]  You're going for real isolationist style of movies here.
[33:43.910 --> 33:44.390]  27.
[33:46.730 --> 33:47.890]  Geoff's out.
[33:52.270 --> 33:55.010]  Will Andrew or Moneybags throw in a bid?
[33:55.030 --> 33:57.670]  No, I'm good. I'm good with giving Eric The Shining.
[33:57.950 --> 33:58.770]  Yeah, you can have it.
[33:58.990 --> 33:59.130]  27.
[34:00.490 --> 34:01.690]  Shining for 27.
[34:01.690 --> 34:02.990]  27 going once to Eric.
[34:03.110 --> 34:04.650]  Got points left over, baby.
[34:06.150 --> 34:07.890]  Going twice to Eric.
[34:09.470 --> 34:15.550]  Sold to Eric for 27 points, rounding out his Halloween Roar box set.
[34:16.010 --> 34:16.330]  Love it.
[34:16.850 --> 34:17.690]  It's a good value, Eric.
[34:17.950 --> 34:18.930]  Nothing but hits, baby.
[34:18.950 --> 34:25.970]  I stopped there because I realized it would get out your other points, and that was more valuable to me than The Shining.
[34:26.290 --> 34:30.710]  Not having to deal with you potentially just throwing 43 points at whatever you wanted to.
[34:31.150 --> 34:32.590]  That's exactly what was about to happen.
[34:34.330 --> 34:35.110]  I'm back up.
[34:35.290 --> 34:36.590]  But Andrew, yeah, you're up.
[34:36.690 --> 34:37.890]  Oh boy, okay.
[34:40.410 --> 34:42.970]  It's really, it's difficult to like have a theme.
[34:44.070 --> 34:45.370]  What you laughing at, Gavin?
[34:45.910 --> 34:46.730]  What am I laughing at?
[34:46.770 --> 34:47.970]  What you laughing at?
[34:48.530 --> 34:52.310]  I just like, whenever it's your turn, you're like, is it my turn?
[34:52.450 --> 34:55.770]  Well, it's because I'm navigating and I'm putting updates on the board.
[34:55.890 --> 34:56.570]  I'm doing stuff.
[34:56.630 --> 34:57.930]  I can't just sit idly.
[34:58.370 --> 34:58.730]  No, I know.
[34:58.770 --> 35:02.850]  But then you go, oh boy, like you didn't expect it.
[35:02.970 --> 35:05.410]  Yeah, this is a big decision.
[35:05.570 --> 35:08.190]  Listen, we had a great year at my studio.
[35:08.970 --> 35:09.770]  This is important.
[35:09.870 --> 35:11.230]  We want to carry it into the fall.
[35:11.750 --> 35:14.790]  I am going to nominate Bone Tomahawk 1 point.
[35:15.590 --> 35:17.230]  Isn't Matthew Fox in that movie?
[35:17.230 --> 35:17.830]  He is.
[35:18.230 --> 35:18.770]  I don't know anything about that movie.
[35:19.290 --> 35:20.410]  Matthew Fox is in it.
[35:20.990 --> 35:21.610]  Kurt Russell?
[35:22.050 --> 35:22.670]  He's looking old.
[35:23.530 --> 35:24.610]  He is looking old.
[35:24.850 --> 35:25.250]  Oh man.
[35:26.250 --> 35:28.310]  Bone Tomahawk, to me, going once.
[35:29.130 --> 35:29.910]  With one.
[35:31.690 --> 35:32.130]  Twice.
[35:34.090 --> 35:35.850]  Sold, to me, for one point.
[35:36.110 --> 35:36.970]  I like that a lot.
[35:37.030 --> 35:38.690]  I know that's not a popular movie.
[35:39.030 --> 35:40.550]  One of my favorite movies of all time.
[35:40.710 --> 35:41.370]  I love Bone Tomahawk.
[35:41.370 --> 35:41.970]  Oh wow, really?
[35:41.970 --> 35:43.490]  I think it's so well written.
[35:44.090 --> 35:46.370]  And it's such a good...
[35:47.250 --> 35:48.930]  I'm blanking his name right now.
[35:49.010 --> 35:49.790]  He's a character actor.
[35:49.890 --> 35:50.970]  Richard Jennings?
[35:51.770 --> 35:52.410]  Is that his name?
[35:53.110 --> 35:54.230]  He's in Burn After Reading.
[35:55.290 --> 35:57.150]  He was in Cabin in the Woods.
[35:57.530 --> 35:58.790]  As like the IT guy.
[35:59.110 --> 36:00.410]  The guy from Step Brothers?
[36:00.610 --> 36:01.030]  Yeah.
[36:01.930 --> 36:02.810]  And Me, Myself, Larry?
[36:03.230 --> 36:03.650]  Yeah.
[36:04.430 --> 36:05.990]  Well, I haven't seen that, so I don't know about that.
[36:07.890 --> 36:09.310]  He's fantastic in it.
[36:09.630 --> 36:10.470]  It's a great movie.
[36:10.690 --> 36:11.370]  Love Bone Tomahawk.
[36:11.970 --> 36:13.610]  Okay, next up.
[36:13.830 --> 36:14.430]  Gavin.
[36:22.170 --> 36:23.250]  Psycho.
[36:24.270 --> 36:27.970]  Not interested.
[36:28.970 --> 36:29.950]  I'm good.
[36:30.330 --> 36:31.810]  Does anyone want it?
[36:32.670 --> 36:33.050]  Not particularly.
[36:33.230 --> 36:33.370]  One.
[36:37.550 --> 36:40.090]  Gavin with one.
[36:40.090 --> 36:41.610]  Going once.
[36:42.570 --> 36:43.470]  What number is it, Gavin?
[36:45.450 --> 36:47.030]  That's a good question.
[36:47.610 --> 36:48.330]  Going twice.
[36:48.330 --> 36:50.950]  We've been asking over and over the whole time we've been doing this.
[36:53.310 --> 36:55.750]  Gavin gets Psycho with one point.
[36:56.050 --> 36:58.610]  Rounding out his film collection.
[36:59.390 --> 36:59.950]  My theme?
[37:00.650 --> 37:01.970]  One word bangers.
[37:05.290 --> 37:06.330]  It's pretty good.
[37:06.510 --> 37:07.530]  I don't think that...
[37:07.530 --> 37:09.350]  I don't know if people buy it for that.
[37:09.350 --> 37:10.170]  But I do.
[37:10.350 --> 37:11.210]  I think it's very cool.
[37:11.350 --> 37:13.590]  Are you going to put that on the front box of it?
[37:13.890 --> 37:14.090]  Yeah.
[37:14.230 --> 37:15.210]  One word bangers?
[37:15.390 --> 37:15.650]  Yep.
[37:15.810 --> 37:16.630]  I like it.
[37:16.770 --> 37:17.730]  Buy lights, camera, clench.
[37:21.310 --> 37:21.670]  Okay.
[37:23.510 --> 37:24.390]  I'll throw out...
[37:25.790 --> 37:27.230]  Has anybody said The Exorcist yet?
[37:27.930 --> 37:28.230]  No.
[37:28.590 --> 37:29.670]  No, not on the list.
[37:30.030 --> 37:31.710]  Hey, what happens...
[37:31.710 --> 37:34.770]  Do we just go until we run out of money or do we have to stop picking at some point?
[37:34.790 --> 37:36.070]  Once you have five, you're done.
[37:36.550 --> 37:36.710]  Yep.
[37:36.710 --> 37:38.450]  But it keeps going until everybody has five.
[37:38.550 --> 37:40.010]  You can't end up with money.
[37:40.410 --> 37:40.510]  Yes.
[37:40.510 --> 37:42.050]  Okay, then I'll throw The Exorcist out there.
[37:42.650 --> 37:45.690]  I will put five in for The Exorcist.
[37:46.210 --> 37:47.350]  You got five on it.
[37:47.910 --> 37:48.810]  I got five.
[37:49.950 --> 37:50.630]  Is that it?
[37:51.170 --> 37:52.190]  No one else wants it?
[37:52.690 --> 37:53.170]  Yeah, I don't want it.
[37:53.210 --> 37:53.450]  Wow.
[37:53.510 --> 37:54.290]  I just want to get it out of the way.
[37:54.610 --> 37:55.070]  You got it.
[37:55.510 --> 37:57.390]  I'll gladly take The Exorcist five.
[37:57.510 --> 37:58.070]  I just want to get it out of the way.
[37:58.110 --> 37:58.790]  I just want to...
[37:58.790 --> 37:58.950]  Yeah.
[38:00.210 --> 38:02.210]  He got The Thing and The Exorcist.
[38:02.530 --> 38:03.490]  He's got a great list going.
[38:03.790 --> 38:04.690]  And Anaconda.
[38:05.930 --> 38:08.850]  All that and J-Lo and Owen Wilson.
[38:09.430 --> 38:10.390]  And Eric Stoltz.
[38:10.770 --> 38:11.670]  And Eric Stoltz.
[38:11.850 --> 38:15.770]  He eats a fucking wasp or something and then disappears for the rest of the movie.
[38:17.150 --> 38:18.210]  I like it.
[38:18.330 --> 38:21.250]  Okay, well, no one else apparently wants it.
[38:21.910 --> 38:22.590]  Last chance.
[38:24.330 --> 38:25.990]  Sold to me for five points.
[38:27.010 --> 38:27.370]  Wow.
[38:27.970 --> 38:31.090]  If we fill our slots, can we bid again and trash another one?
[38:31.510 --> 38:31.830]  No.
[38:32.370 --> 38:32.810]  That's unfortunate.
[38:33.670 --> 38:34.450]  You're out.
[38:34.450 --> 38:34.910]  You're done.
[38:35.350 --> 38:36.770]  That does happen in real Hollywood, though.
[38:36.870 --> 38:38.110]  It would be burning the funds.
[38:39.270 --> 38:40.290]  I wouldn't get a refund.
[38:41.330 --> 38:41.510]  No.
[38:42.090 --> 38:42.290]  Okay.
[38:43.070 --> 38:43.430]  Nick!
[38:44.070 --> 38:48.190]  I would like to nominate number 50, Dawn of the Dead from 2004.
[38:48.390 --> 38:49.530]  Oh, that's real good.
[38:50.090 --> 38:51.530]  It's a fun zombie movie.
[38:52.270 --> 38:53.850]  Maybe Zack Snyder's best.
[38:54.110 --> 38:55.930]  And that went over the original, huh?
[38:56.350 --> 38:57.110]  I think it is.
[38:57.570 --> 38:58.710]  I mean, they're very different movies.
[38:58.890 --> 38:59.490]  They're going for different things.
[38:59.490 --> 38:59.990]  Very different.
[39:00.550 --> 39:01.650]  Very different movies.
[39:02.130 --> 39:03.450]  I'd like to put a one on that.
[39:05.130 --> 39:05.490]  It's...
[39:05.490 --> 39:07.910]  I think you should.
[39:08.710 --> 39:12.390]  No, I want... there's something else I want on this.
[39:12.530 --> 39:14.030]  I want some... Nick, you can have it.
[39:14.750 --> 39:15.050]  Alright.
[39:15.270 --> 39:16.590]  You don't want to get in on this anyway.
[39:18.710 --> 39:19.950]  Nick would crush you.
[39:20.070 --> 39:22.190]  I don't want to fight your 82 points.
[39:22.310 --> 39:26.930]  He has 82... well, now he has 81 points, if you can knock his one point off of there.
[39:26.990 --> 39:29.790]  So he's got... he's got a lot to spend on this last movie.
[39:29.930 --> 39:31.290]  This studio is saving money.
[39:31.290 --> 39:34.910]  If he doesn't spend a lot on that last movie, think of the marketing budget he's going to have.
[39:36.290 --> 39:38.730]  He's going to have 80 points of marketing budget.
[39:38.810 --> 39:39.430]  Way to go, man.
[39:40.730 --> 39:42.270]  I own Regulatrion, baby.
[39:44.390 --> 39:47.410]  Well, I'm out, so I guess I'm not nominating anything.
[39:47.570 --> 39:48.530]  So it goes back up to Andrew.
[39:48.930 --> 39:50.310]  Goes back to me.
[39:51.370 --> 39:52.150]  Is it your turn?
[39:52.670 --> 39:53.770]  It is my turn.
[39:54.810 --> 39:56.790]  I'm going to nominate Scream.
[39:58.510 --> 39:59.550]  I'm going to nominate...
[40:00.850 --> 40:01.650]  I'm going to put...
[40:02.450 --> 40:05.110]  Ah, fuck it. I'll put 33 points on it.
[40:05.170 --> 40:06.390]  I only have one movie left anyway.
[40:06.870 --> 40:07.050]  Wow.
[40:07.530 --> 40:07.910]  33 on Scream.
[40:08.890 --> 40:11.830]  I want a fun slasher movie as part of my box set.
[40:12.630 --> 40:14.470]  That was the last movie I wanted.
[40:14.590 --> 40:17.790]  I was hoping to bleed you guys out before I could get it, but that's okay.
[40:18.070 --> 40:18.970]  Enjoy Scream.
[40:19.890 --> 40:22.810]  Can I... can I bid and sell it to someone else?
[40:22.810 --> 40:23.410]  God.
[40:27.090 --> 40:29.510]  I'm putting Scream in for 33.
[40:29.830 --> 40:30.270]  Yep, Andrew's got it.
[40:30.270 --> 40:31.590]  That doesn't sound like there's any opposition.
[40:32.310 --> 40:32.630]  That's it.
[40:32.630 --> 40:33.570]  That is my last film.
[40:34.050 --> 40:36.170]  I got some serious heavy hitters.
[40:36.270 --> 40:37.490]  I got some fun popcorn.
[40:37.850 --> 40:39.070]  I really like my box set.
[40:39.470 --> 40:39.950]  All right.
[40:41.150 --> 40:41.590]  Geoff.
[40:43.250 --> 40:46.550]  You can nominate a movie that you want or maybe just one you want to get off the board.
[40:46.690 --> 40:47.090]  Either way.
[40:47.610 --> 40:51.150]  I'm going to nominate A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.
[40:51.150 --> 40:53.370]  I believe it's an Iranian film, isn't it?
[40:54.050 --> 40:54.850]  I have no idea.
[40:54.910 --> 40:56.050]  I don't really know anything about it.
[40:56.450 --> 40:59.050]  I think you can bid one point and you'll get it for that.
[40:59.350 --> 41:00.770]  I'm going to bid one point.
[41:01.850 --> 41:03.530]  I'm excited to learn Geoff's theme.
[41:04.350 --> 41:06.050]  Yeah, it's an Iranian ghost story.
[41:07.390 --> 41:08.090]  I always want to see it.
[41:08.310 --> 41:08.710]  Okay.
[41:09.290 --> 41:10.390]  Geoff got it for one.
[41:11.010 --> 41:11.250]  Yeah.
[41:11.670 --> 41:12.070]  Sold.
[41:12.570 --> 41:13.190]  To Geoff.
[41:13.870 --> 41:14.530]  And then Nick.
[41:15.490 --> 41:16.810]  I guess, what do you want?
[41:17.470 --> 41:18.310]  I'm going to go with...
[41:18.310 --> 41:22.590]  Dick with 81 points and nobody else for competition.
[41:24.190 --> 41:25.630]  Number 51, Wreck.
[41:26.150 --> 41:26.590]  Wreck.
[41:27.150 --> 41:27.830]  Great movie.
[41:27.850 --> 41:28.190]  Oh, that's a good movie.
[41:28.670 --> 41:29.150]  That's a great movie.
[41:29.250 --> 41:29.670]  It's in brackets.
[41:29.970 --> 41:31.410]  Yeah, real good.
[41:31.710 --> 41:31.970]  Excellent.
[41:32.190 --> 41:33.130]  Way better than...
[41:33.130 --> 41:35.310]  I mean, Quarantine was good, but this is way better.
[41:35.750 --> 41:36.050]  Okay.
[41:36.190 --> 41:38.530]  That was a Spanish film, right?
[41:38.590 --> 41:38.990]  It is.
[41:39.150 --> 41:39.410]  Yes.
[41:40.110 --> 41:42.450]  And then I assume it's just one point on that, huh?
[41:43.490 --> 41:43.770]  Yeah.
[41:44.030 --> 41:44.250]  Yeah.
[41:46.030 --> 41:50.470]  So, I get to walk out of here with 80 grand or whatever.
[41:50.610 --> 41:51.630]  Is that what you think it is?
[41:51.690 --> 41:55.330]  Do you think that each point here goes to $1,000?
[41:56.170 --> 41:56.750]  A million.
[41:57.830 --> 41:59.790]  Oh, you think it goes to a million dollars?
[42:00.690 --> 42:01.630]  I'd like it to.
[42:01.870 --> 42:02.150]  Okay.
[42:02.510 --> 42:06.550]  Well, here's our lists all together.
[42:07.050 --> 42:12.730]  A24, Anaconda, The Thing, Bone Tomahawk, The Exorcist and Scream.
[42:13.570 --> 42:21.730]  Gavin Studio, Lights, Camera, Clunge, Aliens, Ringu, Scanners, Jaws and Psycho.
[42:22.710 --> 42:26.750]  Geoff Studio, Shhh, It Can Hear You Studios.
[42:27.950 --> 42:34.710]  It Follows, Barbarian, Evil Dead 2, Evil Dead and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.
[42:34.770 --> 42:35.290]  Perfect theme.
[42:35.690 --> 42:36.790]  What's your theme, Geoff?
[42:37.010 --> 42:40.630]  Well, let me tell you about Shhh, It Can Hear You Studios.
[42:42.730 --> 42:48.450]  You've heard about all the major film hubs around the world, from Hollywood to Bollywood, right?
[42:48.750 --> 42:51.170]  But what you've never heard of is the Mid-Coast.
[42:51.250 --> 42:55.150]  We are bringing filmmaking back to Michigan, back to Detroit.
[42:55.470 --> 42:59.050]  Everybody knows It Follows is a Michigan-based Detroit film.
[42:59.210 --> 43:00.610]  Barbarian takes place in Michigan.
[43:00.990 --> 43:04.070]  Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 were partially filmed in Michigan.
[43:04.690 --> 43:06.990]  And some of the characters in the movies are from Michigan.
[43:06.990 --> 43:12.850]  Michigan would have loved Don't Breathe or Bird Box or The Crow to round out my list, but those were not on the list.
[43:12.910 --> 43:14.090]  I didn't find out until later.
[43:14.270 --> 43:18.670]  Unfortunately, I was going to pick Scream because Scream 4 was filmed in Michigan.
[43:18.890 --> 43:21.770]  So I was going to make a thing like, we're trying to bring that franchise back.
[43:21.910 --> 43:25.630]  But instead, what we have done is we've gone international.
[43:25.830 --> 43:31.330]  We found the first non-American movie that we want to bring to the States and recreate here.
[43:31.330 --> 43:33.730]  So we're going to do Michigan.
[43:34.470 --> 43:41.330]  Shh! It Can Hear You Studios is going to be going to be recreating A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night.
[43:41.530 --> 43:43.910]  But for American audiences, that's our studio.
[43:44.130 --> 43:45.990]  We're bringing film back to Michigan, baby!
[43:46.850 --> 43:47.370]  Wow!
[43:47.670 --> 43:48.270]  It's pretty fun.
[43:48.590 --> 43:48.650]  Great theme.
[43:49.550 --> 43:50.590]  I like it.
[43:50.750 --> 43:55.830]  Nick's studio, Sauce Boss Studios, got Cloverfield, which I don't think he wanted, trained to boost on.
[43:56.190 --> 43:59.150]  28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead and Wreck.
[44:00.030 --> 44:02.290]  And finally, my studio...
[44:02.290 --> 44:04.150]  Well, just before we move on...
[44:05.490 --> 44:06.470]  Yeah, what's up?
[44:06.910 --> 44:10.610]  Nick, your studio, clearly, you wanted all zombies, is what I'm guessing.
[44:11.110 --> 44:17.570]  Yeah, so, what we've done here is world-ending scenarios.
[44:19.510 --> 44:20.550]  And zombies.
[44:21.630 --> 44:24.530]  And just real important is the, and zombies, part of that.
[44:26.550 --> 44:28.690]  So, we're bringing it back to the world ending.
[44:28.690 --> 44:29.530]  And zombies.
[44:30.210 --> 44:31.090]  Pretty good stuff, man.
[44:31.350 --> 44:31.610]  Yeah.
[44:31.910 --> 44:32.590]  Way to go.
[44:33.210 --> 44:37.950]  But, finally, it is time for my studio.
[44:40.450 --> 44:43.670]  Which means absolute best film studio winner.
[44:44.550 --> 44:50.090]  And I have Blair Witch Project, Cabin in the Woods, Jacob's Ladder, Alien, and The Shining.
[44:50.590 --> 44:53.270]  True isolationist horror classics.
[44:53.730 --> 44:58.470]  I think that this is spooky, scary, fun to watch by yourself or with friends.
[44:59.150 --> 45:00.690]  Definitely some good group watches.
[45:02.850 --> 45:06.930]  A lot of, I don't know, there was a lot of excitement around the Cabin in the Woods when it came out,
[45:06.990 --> 45:10.110]  and it just didn't connect with me the way I wish it did.
[45:10.390 --> 45:15.970]  You know, I, it, you have to have the ones, see, when you're thinking of a box set of five,
[45:16.090 --> 45:19.250]  you have to have the heavy hitter like Alien and The Shining.
[45:19.570 --> 45:20.950]  That's gonna bring the crowds in.
[45:21.210 --> 45:22.790]  You're gonna have the old classics like Blair Witch.
[45:23.090 --> 45:28.370]  Cabin in the Woods and Jacob's Ladder are two where people, like Gavin had talked about earlier,
[45:28.370 --> 45:32.170]  like scanners, it's ones people know about but maybe they haven't seen.
[45:32.570 --> 45:35.490]  And I feel like Cabin in the Woods is having a weird resurgence online right now,
[45:35.550 --> 45:36.790]  and Jacob's Ladder is next.
[45:37.370 --> 45:40.070]  Jacob's Ladder is very cerebral, too.
[45:40.190 --> 45:42.410]  It's good to have that one to make you think.
[45:42.650 --> 45:47.630]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel really good about, I feel honestly really good about everyone's picks.
[45:47.730 --> 45:49.050]  I feel great about my five.
[45:49.870 --> 45:51.130]  I feel pretty fine, actually.
[45:51.470 --> 45:52.470]  I feel very confident.
[45:52.730 --> 45:52.850]  Yeah.
[45:52.990 --> 45:55.170]  Good! Well, it'll be exciting to see.
[45:55.170 --> 46:02.010]  We'll do a poll on the Patreon to determine the order in which these box sets would be popular.
[46:02.710 --> 46:03.430]  Popularity poll.
[46:04.370 --> 46:07.030]  I think we're good. I think this is a great auction, guys.
[46:07.650 --> 46:10.350]  I'm excited to see where our studios go from here.
[46:11.030 --> 46:16.110]  It would be interesting to add the movies as they rank on IMDB and see who has the lowest number.
[46:16.890 --> 46:17.690]  Oh, interesting.
[46:19.050 --> 46:22.310]  I think Anaconda's probably hurting me.
[46:24.510 --> 46:27.990]  I don't think Scanners is helping Gavin either, honestly.
[46:28.070 --> 46:28.770]  No, no.
[46:30.050 --> 46:31.770]  But yeah, a little bit of intrigue around it.
[46:32.150 --> 46:32.990]  Yeah, that's fun.
[46:33.670 --> 46:36.190]  Great work, Andrew. This was a really good idea.
[46:36.630 --> 46:37.250]  Yeah, this was awesome.
[46:38.150 --> 46:42.290]  It's surprising that I think I'm the only one with what is technically a bad movie.
[46:42.590 --> 46:43.990]  Like, I think Anaconda's a lot of fun.
[46:44.810 --> 46:47.530]  Everything else on this list, I think are, oh, I haven't seen Scanners.
[46:48.370 --> 46:50.170]  Sounds like Scanners might be bad. Never mind.
[46:50.470 --> 46:51.390]  I think it's very dated.
[46:51.390 --> 46:52.550]  Oh, is it dated?
[46:52.830 --> 46:55.130]  Scanners has one moment, you know what I mean?
[46:55.610 --> 46:55.850]  Yeah.
[46:55.970 --> 46:57.290]  And I've seen that moment.
[46:57.410 --> 46:57.610]  Yeah.
[46:57.630 --> 46:58.210]  As we all have.
[46:58.470 --> 46:58.950]  Cool effect.
[46:59.430 --> 47:00.330]  Very cool effect.
[47:00.970 --> 47:03.090]  But thank you so much for listening.
[47:03.610 --> 47:05.090]  Make sure you check out our Patreon.
[47:05.590 --> 47:07.210]  Maybe this is on Patreon only.
[47:07.470 --> 47:07.970]  Who knows?
[47:08.450 --> 47:09.350]  We'll schedule it later.
[47:09.570 --> 47:13.450]  But if not, check out our Patreon at TheRegulationPod, Regulatrion.com.
[47:13.730 --> 47:15.210]  We've got a podcast, check that out.
[47:16.030 --> 47:18.110]  I think I'm happy.
[47:18.470 --> 47:19.290]  Can I just clarify?
[47:19.650 --> 47:20.010]  Yeah.
[47:20.010 --> 47:22.430]  Are the films listed in order that we bought them?
[47:23.030 --> 47:23.430]  Yes.
[47:24.150 --> 47:28.130]  I just love the idea of Geoff's listing Evil Dead 2 and then Evil Dead around.
[47:30.930 --> 47:32.810]  Oh, I had to jump on it when it got brought up.
[47:33.050 --> 47:33.510]  Gotta be.
[47:33.530 --> 47:36.010]  He had to ensure that he got the one for the set.
[47:36.190 --> 47:36.390]  Yep.
[47:37.450 --> 47:38.810]  All right, we'll see you guys next time.
[47:38.930 --> 47:39.270]  Bye!
[47:39.630 --> 47:39.910]  Bye!
[47:39.910 --> 47:40.110]  Bye!
