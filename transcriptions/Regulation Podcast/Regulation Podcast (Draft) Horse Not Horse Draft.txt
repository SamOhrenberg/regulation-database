[00:00.000 --> 00:07.840]  Hello and welcome to another piece of supplemental content. Boy, am I excited for us and for you
[00:07.840 --> 00:14.080]  today because today is going to be one of those one of those magical experiences where we all
[00:14.080 --> 00:19.940]  get to share in something that's greater than the sum of our parts because we are inventing
[00:19.940 --> 00:26.880]  and unleashing unto the world to that but what what the horse not horse draft it's okay Nick's
[00:26.880 --> 00:31.180]  that little flub out I don't think he's gonna edit any of that I think that that's I mean
[00:31.180 --> 00:35.680]  that's a hot that's that's absolutely you he's gonna edit that bit right out and then we'll be
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.300]  fine I'm really worried about this one oh he's worried I'm just worried that all of my picks
[00:40.300 --> 00:45.500]  will get taken before I use him it's it's possible that is very possible that's very
[00:45.500 --> 00:52.440]  very possible with this one you better hope to go first well in order to go first we must go to our
[00:53.980 --> 00:55.360]  ...and randomize our names.
[00:56.140 --> 01:01.640]  This horse-not-horse draft, where the pool is...
[01:01.640 --> 01:02.940]  Horses! That aren't horses.
[01:04.020 --> 01:06.300]  Is that how... I mean, this was a Geoff idea?
[01:06.500 --> 01:07.900]  Oh, I'm sorry, this was a Gavin idea.
[01:08.020 --> 01:08.780]  Yeah, it's a Gavin idea.
[01:08.800 --> 01:09.120]  Oh, right.
[01:09.280 --> 01:10.000]  Sorry, Gavin.
[01:10.380 --> 01:14.260]  But we can leave it to Geoff to explain exactly what we're drafting, if that's okay.
[01:14.700 --> 01:18.940]  Yeah, allow me a second to get into the mind of Gavin real fast.
[01:18.940 --> 01:25.140]  When he birthed this idea into the universe and gifted us all, yet again, with his brilliance.
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.420]  I believe what Gavin was going for here is a draft where we draft horses that are not horses.
[01:32.080 --> 01:36.220]  Yeah, it's weird that I'm so worried about my own idea. It's crazy how that worked out.
[01:37.500 --> 01:39.820]  Listen, you gotta be more confident in yourself.
[01:40.280 --> 01:42.720]  Why do I do it to myself? That's what I always say.
[01:43.260 --> 01:44.740]  You're always saying that.
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.940]  So I could throw out an example, but then...
[01:47.940 --> 01:51.140]  No need, because I think that it will probably be on the draft board.
[01:51.380 --> 01:52.620]  Yeah, don't do it. It's entirely possible.
[01:52.820 --> 01:57.000]  I wouldn't do an example. I don't know why you would do an example. I don't know that we've ever done an example.
[01:57.340 --> 02:01.360]  Well, you wanted me to explain what it was, and so I just want to make sure everybody understands.
[02:01.620 --> 02:04.760]  Didn't feel like it needed an example in order to be explained.
[02:05.160 --> 02:10.800]  Okay, well, I didn't think it needed to be explained because the title was the explanation. Horses that aren't horses.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.840]  Right, it makes sense to me, Geoff.
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.120]  I didn't elaborate in any way when I explained. I just read the title of the draft.
[02:18.400 --> 02:20.240]  You're right. You didn't elaborate in any way.
[02:20.240 --> 02:21.600]  And everybody was like, oh, okay.
[02:22.080 --> 02:25.000]  And then I go, if I need to go further, I can give an example.
[02:25.160 --> 02:28.740]  And everybody's like, whoa, hold on, back off, don't give an example, Jesus Christ.
[02:28.980 --> 02:32.440]  Do I hear trotting? Wait, is that trotting?
[02:32.840 --> 02:36.080]  No, it can't be. It's not a horse. We're doing not horses. It's horse not horse.
[02:36.440 --> 02:39.140]  It has to be some other thing that's similar to a trot.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.800]  Speaking of trotting, my anus is clearing up.
[02:43.540 --> 02:46.900]  How was the rest of your fish evening, Gavin?
[02:47.200 --> 02:49.780]  It was a bad evening, but today we're solidifying.
[02:50.120 --> 02:52.180]  And I don't think I've got the trots any longer.
[02:53.080 --> 02:53.560]  Excellent!
[02:53.860 --> 02:54.180]  There you go.
[02:55.040 --> 02:55.520]  Trots.
[02:55.980 --> 02:59.460]  How many times are we randomizing names here for horse not horse?
[02:59.680 --> 02:59.940]  Five!
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.220]  Yeah, I think five for the letters horse.
[03:02.620 --> 03:03.460]  That's what I was thinking.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.460]  And that's how many legs a horse has.
[03:06.340 --> 03:07.180]  There you go.
[03:07.420 --> 03:07.620]  What?
[03:07.620 --> 03:10.500]  Are you alright?
[03:10.540 --> 03:13.800]  Here we go. It is Andrew, Nick, Eric, Geoff, Gavin.
[03:13.860 --> 03:17.220]  We randomized five times. Here's one, two, three, four.
[03:17.680 --> 03:19.780]  Which would be Eric, Nick, Geoff, Andrew, Gavin.
[03:19.780 --> 03:20.220]  Keep me there!
[03:20.380 --> 03:22.000]  I belong in the boring ass middle.
[03:22.420 --> 03:23.380]  Keep me there!
[03:23.560 --> 03:29.740]  And then here we go. Five! Nick, Gavin, Eric, Geoff, Andrew.
[03:29.960 --> 03:31.940]  That is the order that we will be drafting.
[03:31.940 --> 03:32.420]  Oh, it's good!
[03:32.420 --> 03:37.680]  Horse not horsin'. Boys, it's time. A horse is a horse of course.
[03:37.980 --> 03:41.780]  So let's see what horse not horse you pick. Nick, we start with you.
[03:42.120 --> 03:44.020]  Andrew, how do you feel about being at the end before we start?
[03:44.540 --> 03:50.740]  Fantastic. I feel great. I feel like there's probably seven or eight very obvious picks.
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.220]  And I don't mind being in the back because I feel like I have two that will be safe.
[03:54.540 --> 03:54.800]  Alright.
[03:55.180 --> 03:57.300]  You gotta get that Andrew level confidence, Gavin.
[03:57.600 --> 03:58.460]  Yeah, dude!
[03:58.840 --> 03:59.520]  Maybe next time.
[04:00.380 --> 04:05.760]  I got my coconuts at my desk. I'm holy grailing it. I'm ready for this draft. Let's do it. I got my fake horse.
[04:06.180 --> 04:08.160]  Before Nick goes, how many does everyone have?
[04:08.420 --> 04:09.540]  Oh, that's a good question. Let me see.
[04:09.600 --> 04:10.100]  I have eight.
[04:10.520 --> 04:10.660]  Ten.
[04:11.040 --> 04:13.580]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I have ten.
[04:13.840 --> 04:14.120]  Andrew?
[04:14.240 --> 04:14.500]  Twelve.
[04:15.160 --> 04:15.900]  I have fourteen.
[04:16.600 --> 04:16.960]  Wow!
[04:17.640 --> 04:17.940]  Shit! Oh my goodness!
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.740]  I'm so excited to see the honorable mentions, but we get started.
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.320]  Before we get to honorable mentions, we have to get to actual mentions.
[04:24.580 --> 04:26.900]  And that would be it with our first draft pick.
[04:27.920 --> 04:34.840]  I'm going with something that is very near and dear to me, which is horseradish sauce, or horsey sauce as it's known.
[04:35.020 --> 04:37.800]  It goes well with roast beef.
[04:38.440 --> 04:40.040]  Horseradish first overall?
[04:40.540 --> 04:42.140]  I'm sorry, are you questioning me?
[04:42.500 --> 04:45.980]  I just feel it's a very divisive horse not horse.
[04:47.060 --> 04:51.380]  I feel like there are people that absolutely hate horseradish.
[04:51.880 --> 04:55.560]  Horseradish is absolutely tremendous and would have been my first pick.
[04:56.120 --> 04:56.700]  It's delicious.
[04:57.560 --> 04:58.440]  It's amazing!
[04:58.820 --> 05:02.400]  First off, you can sweeten it and make it... oh, you hate white things.
[05:03.580 --> 05:08.960]  Well, Geoff, let me just say, you're missing out. It is truly a treat on certain seafoods.
[05:09.140 --> 05:11.100]  You can dye it green and pretend it's wasabi.
[05:14.820 --> 05:16.140]  You could also do that.
[05:16.880 --> 05:22.180]  I feel I most engage with horseradish in honey mustard, and sometimes it's just not the feel.
[05:22.560 --> 05:26.240]  You most engage with horseradish? Is that what you said?
[05:26.240 --> 05:27.380]  What does that mean?
[05:27.980 --> 05:31.620]  Because there are certain honey mustards that have horseradish in them.
[05:31.720 --> 05:34.300]  Yeah, which gives it a nice pep.
[05:34.460 --> 05:37.880]  No, but I'm saying that's not a universal across every honey mustard.
[05:38.040 --> 05:42.800]  There are just some variants that use horseradish, and sometimes it's a bit much.
[05:43.220 --> 05:43.900]  It can be a bit much.
[05:44.440 --> 05:48.100]  I'm sure all the radish heads out there are going to go crazy over this first pick.
[05:48.580 --> 05:49.840]  I think it's divisive.
[05:50.160 --> 05:54.380]  Your first pick, because you said specifically horseradish sauce. Is it horseradish or horseradish sauce?
[05:54.820 --> 05:55.200]  The sauce.
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.840]  Okay. I'm just making sure. I want to make sure I'm being thorough here.
[05:59.060 --> 06:02.140]  Was horseradish one that everyone had on their list?
[06:03.060 --> 06:04.460]  No, because I knew it was going to get picked.
[06:04.900 --> 06:06.760]  Yeah, I had it. I had it as horsey sauce.
[06:07.340 --> 06:10.220]  Specifically from Arby's, but it's the same thing, so I can't.
[06:10.220 --> 06:14.920]  It is the same thing, but horsey sauce is better than some just horseradish sauces.
[06:15.400 --> 06:18.140]  I just don't know why they changed the name to horsey sauce.
[06:19.100 --> 06:19.280]  Nay.
[06:21.700 --> 06:23.580]  I've never even seen horsey sauce.
[06:23.580 --> 06:25.240]  Great explanation, man.
[06:25.820 --> 06:28.900]  You guys are going to be great on vaudeville later.
[06:32.140 --> 06:37.940]  Well, horseradish sauce is off the board, and now we go to Gavin. International pick here.
[06:38.200 --> 06:41.600]  Gavin, what is your first choice in the horse not horse draft?
[06:41.880 --> 06:49.820]  I feel like that was going to be my first pick, but I feel like I'm going to take a page out of Nick's book and go with horseradish, just horseradish.
[06:50.100 --> 06:52.160]  So you're just going to copy Nick?
[06:52.160 --> 06:54.600]  No, no, no. I'm not going to dilute it.
[06:54.800 --> 06:57.240]  That's Nick's book, though. Every choice he makes is a copy of yours.
[06:57.460 --> 06:58.620]  Yep. Yep.
[06:58.760 --> 06:59.760]  Gavin, I respect the move.
[06:59.980 --> 07:00.400]  You do?
[07:01.960 --> 07:03.160]  Yeah, it's my fucking move.
[07:03.480 --> 07:07.700]  Yeah, yeah. There's a reason he loves it. He went, shit, I should do that.
[07:07.880 --> 07:09.620]  How do you feel about it being used against you?
[07:10.780 --> 07:15.260]  I mean, horseradish sauce is superior to the original horseradish, so use it if you want.
[07:15.460 --> 07:20.620]  I feel like you can't make horseradish sauce without horseradish, and you can use horseradish in other ways.
[07:20.620 --> 07:22.860]  What are the other ways that you can use horseradish?
[07:23.120 --> 07:25.420]  Yeah, tell me how. You bathe with it? What do you do?
[07:25.460 --> 07:31.120]  Well, pretend wasabi. You can grate it. You can put it in, you know...
[07:32.200 --> 07:37.440]  I meant like, what other dishes can you make? And Nick said, bathe with it.
[07:37.760 --> 07:40.340]  Yeah, I mean, I'm curious where he's going with it.
[07:41.020 --> 07:42.040]  Want to smell spicy?
[07:42.460 --> 07:44.540]  Dig it up out of the ground? That's what I picked.
[07:45.300 --> 07:46.340]  There you go.
[07:47.180 --> 07:48.840]  Excellent. You can dig it up. Excellent.
[07:49.060 --> 07:53.800]  It's a key ingredient in like 80% of the spells in Charmed.
[07:55.760 --> 07:57.760]  And you can't dig up the sauce.
[07:58.900 --> 08:00.300]  I mean, if you drop it, you can.
[08:01.720 --> 08:04.040]  If you drop it so hard it goes underground?
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.000]  It might fall into a hole.
[08:07.000 --> 08:13.100]  What is happening?
[08:13.620 --> 08:18.620]  Okay, well, horseradish sauce and horseradish are both off the board.
[08:18.740 --> 08:20.560]  Did anyone just have horseradish by itself?
[08:20.920 --> 08:22.360]  Nope. Nope. I did.
[08:22.580 --> 08:24.820]  I sort of viewed them as one in the same.
[08:25.220 --> 08:27.940]  Yeah. It's my bit, Gavin. I had it. Of course I had it.
[08:28.280 --> 08:32.220]  So if I didn't draft that, you would have next drafted horseradish.
[08:32.700 --> 08:33.520]  Yeah, probably.
[08:33.740 --> 08:34.680]  Depending on what's left.
[08:36.040 --> 08:36.980]  Might have saved it for the end.
[08:36.980 --> 08:41.300]  It would have been horseradish sauce and then his second pick would have been just horseradish the thing.
[08:41.580 --> 08:41.820]  The root.
[08:41.980 --> 08:43.060]  No, I'd have closed out with it.
[08:43.180 --> 08:46.340]  And then his third pick would have been horse and his fourth pick would have been radish.
[08:47.860 --> 08:49.280]  His fifth pick was sauce.
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.260]  Oh my god.
[08:54.780 --> 09:02.920]  Okay. Alright, well, I'm the next pick and I'm definitely getting away from this root, this edible thing.
[09:02.920 --> 09:07.600]  Because I am going very specific with the 1965 Ford Mustang.
[09:10.240 --> 09:13.340]  That's very interesting. I wasn't sure if we were going to allow this.
[09:13.560 --> 09:20.220]  Incredible year for the car. Incredible look. That is truly an impressive motor vehicle.
[09:20.420 --> 09:26.420]  The Ford Mustang is my horse, not horse. Why would we not allow it?
[09:26.580 --> 09:28.260]  How is that a horse or not a horse?
[09:28.260 --> 09:34.680]  Well, because Mustang is a horse and it's not. I wasn't sure if everything needed horse in it.
[09:35.040 --> 09:36.840]  What is the confusion?
[09:37.360 --> 09:38.580]  It doesn't have the word horse in it.
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.980]  Why would it have to have the word horse? It's a Mustang, which is a horse.
[09:44.940 --> 09:47.520]  I'm not saying what you're... I just wasn't sure.
[09:47.560 --> 09:52.260]  You are saying... You're the one who brought it up. This is your fault. You dunce.
[09:52.260 --> 09:56.880]  No, everybody's in agreement. And I feel like I'm the one pushing the least, dickhead.
[09:57.120 --> 10:01.760]  I'm just saying... I thought everything...
[10:02.720 --> 10:09.260]  I'm on your side. I'm just saying I wasn't sure if everybody would want a horse, not horse, to have all the horses.
[10:10.300 --> 10:16.220]  I hate that you're on my side. This is... You're a fucking maniac.
[10:16.280 --> 10:19.620]  I wasn't even against it. I just said I wasn't sure.
[10:19.620 --> 10:23.720]  To bring it up at all is psychotic.
[10:24.680 --> 10:31.020]  Just because I brought it up doesn't mean everybody else wasn't thinking it. There's a fucking parade of people behind me.
[10:31.300 --> 10:33.220]  What did you think was gonna happen?
[10:33.720 --> 10:37.140]  Andrew, I believe that they're all impossible of their own thought.
[10:38.020 --> 10:44.100]  Andrew, thank you for the clarity that you brought to this draft because it helps inform my next choice.
[10:44.100 --> 10:52.480]  It really helped. Thanks, man. Thanks for being on my side. I appreciate it.
[10:52.600 --> 10:59.020]  I vocalized it. I really thought the parade of people behind me that seemed to be more concerned about it would have more to say, but they didn't, apparently.
[10:59.380 --> 11:04.620]  I'm very aware that you vocalized it. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. That's awesome.
[11:07.520 --> 11:08.500]  I liked it.
[11:10.720 --> 11:14.400]  I really do appreciate it, Andrew. Thank you. I have the same question.
[11:16.100 --> 11:17.720]  Yeah, I don't like that pic.
[11:18.540 --> 11:19.640]  They don't give a shit.
[11:22.480 --> 11:23.280]  Don't care.
[11:23.920 --> 11:25.820]  It is not for us to judge, Gavin, but...
[11:25.820 --> 11:28.340]  I feel like, kind of, mostly it is.
[11:29.220 --> 11:30.860]  You know what? I take it back.
[11:30.880 --> 11:35.560]  I mean, it's fine. You're wrong. It's a horse, not horse.
[11:35.560 --> 11:39.880]  The 1965 Ford Mustang, on the list, number one with a bullet.
[11:40.200 --> 11:41.360]  A Mustang is a horse.
[11:41.780 --> 11:42.600]  Yeah, no shit.
[11:42.820 --> 11:44.360]  Yeah, but I feel like there's a spirit to this thing.
[11:44.640 --> 11:45.900]  I mean, if a Mustang is a horse...
[11:45.900 --> 11:50.920]  You picked the same thing! The first two picks are the same thing!
[11:51.240 --> 11:51.980]  They're different.
[11:53.540 --> 11:55.220]  There's a spirit to this thing.
[11:55.700 --> 11:59.860]  I'm gonna go with 1 and I'm gonna go with 1A. Alright, right on, man. Cool.
[11:59.920 --> 12:00.960]  No, they're different, though. They're different.
[12:01.080 --> 12:04.860]  Geoff, you have your first pick in the horse, not horse draft.
[12:04.860 --> 12:09.740]  Goddamn, you guys got me a little scared to pick now, but I'm gonna go ahead and take you out on a limb here.
[12:10.020 --> 12:14.580]  I'm gonna pick the original horse-toothed jackass, Gary Delebate.
[12:18.800 --> 12:19.140]  Uhhh...
[12:19.140 --> 12:22.300]  We established through Eric that it doesn't have to have the word horse in it.
[12:22.300 --> 12:25.040]  But even if it did, that's his name. Horse-toothed jackass.
[12:25.520 --> 12:26.740]  He's a horse, not a horse.
[12:27.200 --> 12:28.320]  Andrew, whose side are you on?
[12:28.840 --> 12:30.720]  I just, I mean, I think it's a wild pick.
[12:30.720 --> 12:36.120]  I do feel, I'd like to hear the other people's thoughts that were like, I don't know if I have enough picks.
[12:36.260 --> 12:40.400]  How are you feeling now about your picks and that you're gonna run out?
[12:40.620 --> 12:42.240]  I've got an abundance of picks.
[12:42.440 --> 12:45.580]  Yeah, I am rich. I am rich in picks.
[12:46.740 --> 12:48.560]  Alright, if you guys don't want me to use it, I've got plenty.
[12:48.860 --> 12:52.040]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:52.500 --> 12:55.360]  I think that's so, like, I would never consider that.
[12:55.360 --> 12:56.740]  I like it. I'm not that smart.
[12:56.740 --> 13:00.300]  I think it's great. I will say, I'm not saying that you shouldn't pick him, because I think
[13:00.820 --> 13:05.780]  horse to jackass is great. However, when I think of Gary, I do think of his other animal
[13:05.780 --> 13:07.060]  fursona, the techno beaver.
[13:07.140 --> 13:07.840]  The techno beaver?
[13:08.140 --> 13:09.220]  Yeah, that's me personally.
[13:09.480 --> 13:13.760]  I just wanted to get as much mouth as possible in the image.
[13:14.420 --> 13:15.520]  You definitely got it.
[13:16.100 --> 13:21.820]  Just for the record, that's the only pick I have that doesn't have the word horse in
[13:21.820 --> 13:23.580]  the title, so I'm happy to switch it out.
[13:23.580 --> 13:27.580]  That's what I was going to ask, because did any of our rocks not rocks not have rocks in
[13:27.580 --> 13:28.080]  the title?
[13:28.640 --> 13:29.860]  Did it not have rocks in the title?
[13:30.260 --> 13:30.680]  In the pick?
[13:31.720 --> 13:32.120]  Oh.
[13:33.560 --> 13:34.680]  Yeah, all mine had rock.
[13:34.900 --> 13:35.840]  I think all mine had rock.
[13:36.600 --> 13:37.920]  I don't remember my picks.
[13:38.120 --> 13:38.800]  I don't remember.
[13:39.060 --> 13:39.260]  Great.
[13:39.520 --> 13:45.100]  Well, moving on, Andrew, you actually have two picks here.
[13:45.540 --> 13:50.960]  You have the last pick of the first round and the first pick of the second round.
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.780]  So, Andrew, back to back picks.
[13:52.940 --> 13:53.440]  What you got?
[13:54.220 --> 13:54.660]  It's...
[13:54.660 --> 13:58.240]  I didn't expect to be in this position of some of the things available.
[13:58.580 --> 13:59.100]  I'm shocked.
[13:59.180 --> 14:02.560]  I'm going to go with my first overall pick if I was going first.
[14:02.900 --> 14:04.480]  One of my favorite games at recess.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.500]  One of my favorite pieces of Achievement Hunter content.
[14:08.720 --> 14:10.000]  I'm picking horse.
[14:10.320 --> 14:10.760]  Nice.
[14:10.980 --> 14:11.880]  The game of horse.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.360]  Oh, that's great.
[14:13.580 --> 14:13.980]  It's a great one.
[14:14.100 --> 14:15.000]  It was on my list, too.
[14:15.220 --> 14:20.280]  Taking basketball shots, watching videos, and then eventually you guys got tired of doing
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.880]  so many, so you change it to the pig, reduce the amount of work you have to do.
[14:23.920 --> 14:24.840]  I respect that.
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.260]  Is that right?
[14:25.480 --> 14:25.760]  Did you?
[14:26.040 --> 14:26.840]  I didn't know that.
[14:26.920 --> 14:27.680]  That's really funny.
[14:27.820 --> 14:29.640]  We did Halo Pig and Trials Pig.
[14:30.340 --> 14:30.740]  Yeah.
[14:30.880 --> 14:32.680]  Well, Halo Pig.
[14:33.940 --> 14:35.280]  I just love horse.
[14:35.380 --> 14:36.500]  It's a fun game.
[14:37.360 --> 14:39.120]  Fond memories playing it.
[14:39.420 --> 14:42.160]  Fond memories watching it near and dear to my heart.
[14:42.220 --> 14:43.380]  It's a top horse, not a horse.
[14:43.480 --> 14:44.280]  You watched horse?
[14:44.680 --> 14:45.700]  Oh, you just mean the videos?
[14:46.160 --> 14:46.640]  Yeah, the videos.
[14:47.340 --> 14:49.660]  I mean, I've also watched horses.
[14:49.660 --> 14:52.260]  I don't know what you mean by like, what is horse to you?
[14:52.300 --> 14:53.080]  What does that mean?
[14:53.180 --> 14:54.360]  What were you asking him?
[14:54.480 --> 14:57.400]  I just imagined him at school just watching other people play horse.
[14:57.900 --> 14:58.240]  No.
[14:58.660 --> 14:59.100]  Okay.
[14:59.180 --> 15:03.580]  I mean, maybe I did, but not like, wasn't like, oh, let me put the chair down so I can
[15:03.580 --> 15:04.700]  observe some horse.
[15:05.160 --> 15:05.900]  Let's have some fun.
[15:06.680 --> 15:08.800]  Spend 30 minutes watching other people play horse.
[15:11.040 --> 15:12.300]  That is my first pick.
[15:12.700 --> 15:16.580]  My second pick is, I think, once again, another powerful horse.
[15:16.580 --> 15:23.180]  And just to me, it's a great, a great understanding of how stupid human brains are.
[15:23.540 --> 15:30.120]  It is horsepower, a measurement that was made because the person that was trying to sell
[15:30.120 --> 15:34.680]  like the idea of a device to move things from mining, they were like, no, we got horses
[15:34.680 --> 15:35.160]  for that.
[15:35.260 --> 15:36.480]  We don't we don't need this.
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.680]  And they're like, well, what if we say it's worth 30 horses?
[15:40.020 --> 15:42.600]  And they're like, oh, fuck, you can do 30 horses with this thing?
[15:42.940 --> 15:43.440]  Hell yeah.
[15:44.080 --> 15:45.180]  Give me eight of them.
[15:45.180 --> 15:46.280]  Very dumb.
[15:46.760 --> 15:49.860]  I like it because it's still the measure today.
[15:50.440 --> 15:50.660]  Yes.
[15:51.460 --> 15:53.440]  Oh, how many horsepower does that have?
[15:53.740 --> 15:59.980]  Does that mean it's just like if you had 350 horses, they would go as fast as a car?
[16:00.180 --> 16:00.980]  That's awesome.
[16:01.500 --> 16:02.900]  We got to get 350 horses.
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.100]  It is incredibly stupid logic, but it's what ended up selling.
[16:10.320 --> 16:14.800]  It was like the engine thing they were doing for helping moving mining shit.
[16:15.180 --> 16:16.640]  I feel great about my picks.
[16:16.720 --> 16:17.920]  I feel really good for the swing.
[16:18.400 --> 16:18.920]  They're great.
[16:19.020 --> 16:19.560]  They're really good.
[16:19.640 --> 16:20.160]  Nice swing.
[16:20.280 --> 16:20.960]  Well done.
[16:21.120 --> 16:21.640]  You took a couple.
[16:22.060 --> 16:22.520]  Good shit.
[16:23.020 --> 16:23.240]  Excellent.
[16:23.440 --> 16:26.400]  And you didn't even have to pick horseradish in any way, shape or form.
[16:26.500 --> 16:30.180]  As we go to Geoff with his second pick here.
[16:30.540 --> 16:35.180]  My second pick, I'm going to stay human, I think, with this pick.
[16:35.850 --> 16:40.320]  I think this might be the only other human I have on the list, but this one's a little
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.080]  bit more literal.
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.460]  You may not know him by name, but you know him by the greatest character in Twin Peaks.
[16:46.640 --> 16:51.760]  I'm talking about the actor Michael Horse, who played Deputy Hawk in Twin Peaks.
[16:51.900 --> 16:52.620]  Oh, wow.
[16:52.980 --> 16:54.060]  Michael Horse.
[16:54.160 --> 16:55.320]  I didn't know that was his name.
[16:55.380 --> 16:56.340]  I didn't know that was his name.
[16:56.360 --> 17:02.060]  Michael Horse, coolest character in all of David Lynch's entire au voir.
[17:02.600 --> 17:02.980]  Wow.
[17:03.500 --> 17:06.160]  And when he came back and his hair was all white, it looked epic.
[17:06.500 --> 17:07.840]  Yeah, he looks really cool.
[17:07.940 --> 17:08.340]  Cool as fuck.
[17:08.820 --> 17:09.000]  Yeah.
[17:09.180 --> 17:12.180]  Michael Horse is a great pick in the Horse Not Horse draft.
[17:12.380 --> 17:12.680]  Excellent.
[17:12.800 --> 17:13.160]  Thank you.
[17:13.460 --> 17:14.140]  We're moving on.
[17:14.220 --> 17:17.220]  I'm staying in the world of entertainment and cinema.
[17:18.480 --> 17:26.380]  In the year 1970, much was occurring, but one thing prevailed above all, and that was
[17:26.380 --> 17:31.560]  a young actor, Sylvester Stallone, in a movie that I think he wishes never came out.
[17:31.560 --> 17:34.660]  And that would be Italian Stallion from 1970.
[17:35.880 --> 17:38.880]  Sylvester Stallone, star of Rocky, goes X-rated.
[17:39.280 --> 17:39.420]  Yeah.
[17:39.420 --> 17:45.040]  He plays Stud, and it is an X-rated film that is readily available.
[17:45.580 --> 17:46.820]  Italian Stallion.
[17:46.980 --> 17:47.700]  Does he shag?
[17:48.140 --> 17:51.480]  Yeah, I don't think that it's like hardcore hardcore.
[17:51.620 --> 17:53.060]  I've never seen Italian Stallion.
[17:53.180 --> 17:57.080]  I don't need to watch Stud and Kitty get into whatever they're getting into.
[17:57.080 --> 18:05.300]  But yeah, this being a thing that has followed his career, his entire career, is very interesting
[18:05.300 --> 18:11.480]  to me, to do something that early and then become Oscar nominated, I believe, for Rocky.
[18:11.840 --> 18:12.560]  Good for him.
[18:13.100 --> 18:14.020]  Italian Stallion.
[18:14.800 --> 18:16.300]  Also a nickname, I think, for Rocky.
[18:16.840 --> 18:17.560]  It is, yeah.
[18:18.040 --> 18:18.800]  He's the Italian Stallion.
[18:19.220 --> 18:19.620]  There you go.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.440]  Italian Stallion, 1970, is my pick in Horse Not Horse.
[18:24.480 --> 18:25.200]  Well done.
[18:25.680 --> 18:27.240]  You're fine with that one, but not the other one.
[18:27.320 --> 18:27.600]  Whatever.
[18:27.880 --> 18:28.880]  Gavin, go ahead.
[18:29.020 --> 18:31.980]  You have your second pick for the Horse Not Horse draft.
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.060]  Well, you know, I like fun.
[18:34.480 --> 18:35.720]  I had a lot of fun as a kid.
[18:37.380 --> 18:39.840]  Honestly, before you got here, that's what we were saying.
[18:40.320 --> 18:42.320]  We were like, guys, when's Gavin getting here?
[18:42.420 --> 18:43.380]  We know he likes fun.
[18:43.760 --> 18:44.940]  Always been a lover of fun.
[18:45.220 --> 18:46.140]  I've always been saying that.
[18:46.920 --> 18:49.500]  Sometimes fun, it gets a little bit rowdy.
[18:49.780 --> 18:53.260]  You're sort of pranking each other, diving on each other, shoving each other.
[18:53.460 --> 18:54.140]  It's horseplay.
[18:54.920 --> 18:55.960]  Horseplay is good.
[18:56.120 --> 18:57.360]  That was on my list.
[18:57.500 --> 18:58.340]  Horseplay was on my list.
[18:58.480 --> 18:59.380]  Yeah, horseplay is good.
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.460]  I wonder if people in the horse world describe horseplaying as horseplay.
[19:04.920 --> 19:06.220]  Have horses ever horseplayed?
[19:07.340 --> 19:10.140]  Yeah, I think horses can muck about.
[19:10.600 --> 19:11.480]  Oh, they absolutely can.
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.160]  I just, I wonder if anyone in, like, I wonder if that's the vernacular they use.
[19:15.660 --> 19:16.260]  Like, oh, they're horseplaying.
[19:17.060 --> 19:18.140]  Maybe they call it humanplay.
[19:18.480 --> 19:22.080]  I think, don't they like stand up on like their back legs and like kick at each other and stuff?
[19:22.080 --> 19:24.120]  Oh, they kick at each other, they fuck around.
[19:24.300 --> 19:28.040]  I just saw a video of a horse shoving a cat into a thing of water just for fun.
[19:28.060 --> 19:28.240]  What?
[19:28.840 --> 19:29.200]  Okay.
[19:29.300 --> 19:30.000]  They have a good time.
[19:30.920 --> 19:32.260]  Yeah, sounds like the cat did too.
[19:32.420 --> 19:33.160]  Definite horseplay.
[19:33.580 --> 19:34.800]  I mean, that's a definite horseplay.
[19:34.860 --> 19:39.500]  I'm just curious if people in the horse world ever refer to horseplay as horseplay.
[19:40.120 --> 19:42.620]  I think, like, people do it typically, but I'm not around horses.
[19:43.280 --> 19:45.240]  What do you think they would call it otherwise?
[19:46.020 --> 19:49.880]  I don't, uh, uh, stallion battalion?
[19:50.140 --> 19:50.500]  Okay.
[19:50.500 --> 19:55.540]  You think they have, you think they have another fun term that we just don't know about?
[19:55.740 --> 19:56.600]  I think so.
[19:56.760 --> 19:57.100]  Yeah.
[19:57.860 --> 19:59.520]  Mustang muckery, maybe?
[20:02.660 --> 20:03.460]  Muckering about?
[20:03.960 --> 20:05.560]  That might be my next thing.
[20:07.400 --> 20:08.240]  I don't know.
[20:08.660 --> 20:09.640]  Horse people, let me know.
[20:10.160 --> 20:12.540]  Ever look at a bunch of horses and just go, oh, they're horseplaying.
[20:16.040 --> 20:18.020]  Well, horseplay on the board.
[20:18.220 --> 20:23.020]  We round out the second round with Nick, and we start the third round with him as well.
[20:23.060 --> 20:24.680]  So, Nick, you got back-to-back picks here.
[20:25.160 --> 20:25.740]  Back-to-back.
[20:25.980 --> 20:28.780]  Well, I'm going to take a page from Gavin's book here.
[20:28.960 --> 20:29.560]  Oh, shit.
[20:29.980 --> 20:34.140]  I am going to go with horsing around.
[20:34.340 --> 20:35.320]  Oh, good pick.
[20:35.360 --> 20:36.040]  That was on my list.
[20:36.040 --> 20:46.240]  Now, I have horsing around, but I had it as a horseplay slash horsing around, where to me, they were the same thing.
[20:46.420 --> 20:51.760]  Horsing around, though, is to engage in playful, boisterous, or silly behavior similar to horseplay.
[20:52.940 --> 20:54.740]  Explain how they're different in any way.
[20:54.880 --> 20:57.500]  Explain something that would be horsing around, but not horseplay.
[20:57.940 --> 20:58.860]  Thank you, yes.
[20:59.200 --> 21:01.280]  People usually get hurt when you're horsing around.
[21:01.460 --> 21:02.800]  No, people can get hurt in horseplay.
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.620]  But horseplay is much more fun.
[21:04.620 --> 21:07.440]  Are you saying no one gets hurt in horseplay?
[21:07.900 --> 21:10.300]  I think horseplay becomes horsing around when someone gets hurt.
[21:10.760 --> 21:18.840]  As someone who picked horseradish after horseradish sauce, I'm still going to go in on this and say you just picked exactly what mine was.
[21:18.940 --> 21:19.720]  I don't think so.
[21:19.960 --> 21:22.340]  I'd like to bring Google into this, if I could, for a second.
[21:22.520 --> 21:23.320]  Yes, please do.
[21:23.900 --> 21:33.520]  Google says, while both horseplay and horsing around describe boisterous, playful behavior, horseplay often implies a level of roughhousing or even dangerous activity.
[21:33.520 --> 21:39.800]  Whereas horsing around can range from mild silliness to more energetic, but still relatively harmless play.
[21:40.380 --> 21:40.840]  Get horsed.
[21:41.140 --> 21:42.740]  Well, that's the opposite of what Nick said, then.
[21:43.180 --> 21:47.280]  Well, then I'm wrong. But also, it doesn't matter, because it's different.
[21:49.700 --> 21:50.720]  Get horsed, Gavin.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.720]  I just need to know, just before, because it sounds like we're probably going to let this one in.
[21:56.460 --> 21:57.740]  No, after horseradish, we should.
[21:58.100 --> 22:00.900]  Again, you didn't have a problem with horseradish.
[22:01.520 --> 22:02.900]  I didn't, Mr. Mustang.
[22:03.720 --> 22:08.440]  And you didn't have a problem with Italian style. Again, you're just so all over the place.
[22:08.540 --> 22:12.320]  But what I want to know is whose side Andrew is on.
[22:13.000 --> 22:13.740]  Oh, good question.
[22:14.260 --> 22:19.080]  I'm on the side of allowing it, just because I think the top left of this draft board is hilarious.
[22:19.660 --> 22:20.900]  I don't think...
[22:22.360 --> 22:24.860]  I just love the way that looks. That's ridiculous.
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.000]  It's the same. You guys just keep picking the same shit.
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.340]  Yeah, but who picked it first? Looks like me.
[22:30.340 --> 22:33.280]  Nick and I should never be next to each other in a draft ever again.
[22:34.680 --> 22:39.820]  I feel like I'm looking at a shell game where it's like I need to find the one different, but they all kind of look the same.
[22:42.000 --> 22:43.340]  I'm Coke, he's Pepsi.
[22:43.740 --> 22:46.040]  Yeah, this is very interesting.
[22:46.680 --> 22:52.640]  Well, Nick, horsing around is on the board, but we need to start the third round.
[22:52.800 --> 22:56.780]  Yeah, I'm so excited for whatever Nick's about to pick and then whatever Gavin's going to pick right on top of it.
[22:56.780 --> 23:02.780]  There is a certain term that I love to use when someone says some nonsense, and that is horseshit.
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.740]  Gavin, it's a sign of defeat.
[23:09.320 --> 23:10.500]  Gavin, you made a sound.
[23:11.160 --> 23:13.260]  Well, it was obviously going to be my next pick.
[23:15.480 --> 23:18.680]  So you're talking about the lying version of horseshit, right?
[23:19.180 --> 23:23.360]  I'm talking about the one where you're like, that's a little horseshit, whatever you're saying is nonsense.
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.440]  But you're not specifically talking about a pile of horse feces.
[23:27.360 --> 23:28.100]  I'm not.
[23:28.700 --> 23:31.980]  Oh, very interesting. Gavin, should we just jump right to you for your pick?
[23:35.360 --> 23:38.460]  As much as I want to, I would never allow that.
[23:38.540 --> 23:43.240]  I kind of want you to do it. I want you to do it.
[23:43.360 --> 23:45.640]  Nick has made his third pick here.
[23:46.440 --> 23:49.820]  We all sat quietly waiting for something to happen.
[23:50.520 --> 23:53.780]  Rewind it and listen to the baited breath. It was very exciting.
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.220]  But now we go to Gavin with his third pick in the horse not horse draft.
[23:59.660 --> 24:02.640]  I've just realized that one of my picks just says horse. What am I talking about?
[24:10.760 --> 24:12.440]  It could be the game horse.
[24:12.820 --> 24:14.880]  It could be, but below that I've written Halo horse.
[24:16.680 --> 24:17.860]  I've confused myself.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.040]  To be honest, I'm just really bummed and thrown by not getting horse shit. I should have picked that first instead of horse radish.
[24:25.080 --> 24:28.100]  But, you know, I like animals. I like animals.
[24:32.220 --> 24:40.840]  I like animals with interesting little quirks. Like the male version, jizzing babies all over the ocean. It's a seahorse.
[24:41.620 --> 24:43.900]  Oh, the seahorse. Very nice.
[24:44.500 --> 24:45.460]  Good pick.
[24:45.460 --> 24:53.300]  Fertilizes the female and then for some reason takes all the babies at some point. Don't really know too much about it, but it's cool.
[24:54.940 --> 24:55.900]  Cool footage.
[24:57.420 --> 25:05.200]  The way that you start, like you tee yourself up is so interesting. You know I love fun. You know I like animals.
[25:07.340 --> 25:12.160]  There's no need for a transition. It's fantastic. I think it's so good.
[25:12.500 --> 25:14.360]  Guys, you know I like animals.
[25:16.500 --> 25:19.380]  You know how you're always talking about how much I love animals.
[25:19.500 --> 25:23.800]  You know you were saying about me before I came.
[25:25.320 --> 25:26.400]  He loves fun!
[25:26.760 --> 25:28.800]  This guy fucking loves fun.
[25:30.140 --> 25:37.640]  Well, seahorse is on the board now and we go to me. I'm the dead center here in this draft in the middle.
[25:38.380 --> 25:43.580]  And guys, you know me. I love hair. And that's why with my pick, I'm going with the ponytail.
[25:43.580 --> 25:44.260]  Wow!
[25:45.340 --> 25:56.680]  This is the number one hairstyle besides doing nothing. I would say it's doing nothing with your hair and then if you have long hair, it is ponytail.
[25:57.360 --> 26:07.600]  So you have, those are, I mean, real close together as far as top things you can do with your long, long hair is a ponytail.
[26:08.840 --> 26:09.520]  Thoughts?
[26:10.120 --> 26:10.600]  Excellent!
[26:10.600 --> 26:13.600]  Yeah, it's a very known...
[26:14.280 --> 26:15.980]  We've allowed Mustang and Stallion.
[26:16.240 --> 26:19.460]  I genuinely didn't think of that one. That's uh...
[26:19.920 --> 26:21.280]  That's outside the box, that one.
[26:21.520 --> 26:22.460]  Is a pony a horse?
[26:23.360 --> 26:24.840]  Oh, interesting question.
[26:24.980 --> 26:26.000]  Is a pony a horse?
[26:26.260 --> 26:26.520]  Hold on.
[26:28.720 --> 26:30.160]  We're going to go ahead and let...
[26:30.160 --> 26:37.360]  Hang on, hang on. Nobody else say anything. Nobody else say anything. Nick, if it's not a horse, what do you think it could be?
[26:38.200 --> 26:38.520]  Zebra.
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.700]  Cool. Thanks for coming, man.
[26:40.780 --> 26:41.540]  Oh, racing stripes.
[26:42.340 --> 26:50.480]  Is a zebra a horse? Is a donkey a horse? Is a pony a horse? Is a horse a pony? Or a pony is a horse, but a horse isn't a pony sort of thing?
[26:50.760 --> 26:52.040]  A pony is a type of horse.
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.260]  Listen, Gavin, I expect you to know this as the guy who likes animals.
[26:56.980 --> 26:57.960]  Yeah, but not all of them.
[26:59.420 --> 27:00.200]  Not all of them.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.240]  The real frog is a toad.
[27:03.140 --> 27:05.600]  Wait, no. Toad is frog. Frog not toad.
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.680]  He's like, you know, people like adults that hate kids. Gavin is an animal lover who hates ponies but loves horses.
[27:14.660 --> 27:16.600]  He hates ponies.
[27:17.660 --> 27:19.120]  He thinks ponies are horseshit.
[27:21.160 --> 27:28.080]  Well, Ponytail is on the board and Geoff, you have your third pick. We're getting close to rounding out the third round here.
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.200]  Guys, you know that I like music. I'm a big music guy. Everybody's talking about it all the time.
[27:34.200 --> 27:39.320]  I tend to come into the chat late, and you guys are already having a discussion about how much I like music.
[27:39.700 --> 27:42.180]  That happens constantly, it feels like.
[27:42.380 --> 27:47.480]  And so what I want to do with my draft today is continue to lose the audience.
[27:47.780 --> 27:55.040]  And so I'm going to pick a band that 99.82% of them have never heard.
[27:55.320 --> 27:57.220]  And if they had, they wouldn't like them anyway.
[27:57.500 --> 27:59.040]  Nope. I started writing and had to stop.
[27:59.420 --> 28:01.740]  Quite a bit. Eric knows who I'm talking about.
[28:01.740 --> 28:06.720]  I am picking the Doom Metal band, Funeral Horse.
[28:06.980 --> 28:12.660]  Funeral Horse is on the board. Funeral Horse, cool as hell.
[28:13.260 --> 28:13.580]  Very cool.
[28:15.220 --> 28:18.080]  That's a Burn Dog type of thing.
[28:18.080 --> 28:19.620]  Yeah, it's a band I found through Burn Dog.
[28:20.480 --> 28:24.600]  Is there like a definitive Funeral Horse song?
[28:25.020 --> 28:30.860]  Oh, jeez. Let's see. Amputate the Hands of the Thieves is a good one.
[28:33.780 --> 28:36.280]  Executioner of Kings, that's a great one.
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.360]  Stoned and Furious, I like that one.
[28:39.700 --> 28:43.220]  I Hear the Devil Calling Me, that's the album I have at least.
[28:44.340 --> 28:47.200]  Until the Nation Falls, Until the Last Nation Falls, that's what it's called.
[28:47.340 --> 28:49.000]  I think they're a Texas band too.
[28:49.380 --> 28:50.460]  I think they might be from Houston.
[28:50.680 --> 28:54.220]  There you go, so you get some local points. Way to go, man.
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.000]  I'm going to note that this is a band, just so nobody gets confused later.
[29:00.860 --> 29:02.320]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[29:02.540 --> 29:08.540]  But, Andrew, you have two picks so far, and now you have your final two picks,
[29:08.580 --> 29:11.160]  back to back, the end of round three, the beginning of round four,
[29:11.260 --> 29:13.320]  and the horse not horse draft, what are you going with?
[29:13.740 --> 29:19.660]  I'm going with maybe the most hated horse situation in modern time.
[29:19.880 --> 29:26.100]  Very controversial, I'd say as angering to people as horse radish can be for some.
[29:26.100 --> 29:31.160]  I am going with horse armor DLC from Skyrim.
[29:31.400 --> 29:40.900]  People who lost their goddamn minds over the fact that they were going to have to pay $3 for a horse cosmetic in a video game.
[29:41.020 --> 29:42.820]  It was a huge outrage.
[29:43.420 --> 29:48.160]  And now you look at the modern landscape of how gaming works in its economy.
[29:48.680 --> 29:53.900]  People are spending $20 to look like Goku and Fortnite for one week.
[29:53.900 --> 29:55.860]  Like, it doesn't doesn't matter.
[29:56.120 --> 30:00.080]  People were very up in arms about a thing that eventually just came to be totally acceptable.
[30:00.900 --> 30:04.740]  But, oh, boy, did they hate the idea of buying horse armor.
[30:05.240 --> 30:08.420]  Was this the I'm dropping a dropping a pick in.
[30:08.540 --> 30:11.920]  Is that it? Is that the horse armor? Dropping a pick in the discord there?
[30:12.060 --> 30:14.280]  I think it might be. I believe it is.
[30:14.620 --> 30:17.700]  Oh, that's from Oblivion. Yeah, this was Oblivion, not Skyrim, right?
[30:18.120 --> 30:21.100]  The armor was Oblivion. The horse armor was from Oblivion.
[30:21.100 --> 30:24.420]  The thing is about this pick, though, is that it's about a horse.
[30:24.580 --> 30:27.420]  It is about a horse. Yeah, it's about a horse.
[30:27.520 --> 30:30.060]  It's about a horse, just like horsepower is about a horse.
[30:30.560 --> 30:32.240]  It doesn't involve an actual horse.
[30:32.820 --> 30:35.220]  Yeah, I'm drafted. So I thought you're going to say this.
[30:35.240 --> 30:36.980]  I was going to, like, break it up individually.
[30:37.440 --> 30:41.980]  I'm either drafting armor for a horse to wear, which is not a horse.
[30:42.340 --> 30:46.420]  Or I'm drafting DLC, which is also not a horse.
[30:46.940 --> 30:47.980]  He's got you. Excellent point.
[30:48.300 --> 30:50.020]  So is DLC a horse?
[30:50.020 --> 30:52.820]  No, the horse isn't the thing you get. You get the armor.
[30:53.460 --> 30:54.660]  You get the armor for a horse.
[30:54.980 --> 30:58.280]  So I could just draft, like, a horse shoe?
[30:58.720 --> 31:02.080]  Well, I mean, if you want, you could just, like, draft horseradish, the root.
[31:02.900 --> 31:03.540]  Yeah, horseradish.
[31:03.540 --> 31:04.600]  Yeah, horseradish.
[31:08.400 --> 31:12.100]  You asked it in a very confused way. You could draft a horseshoe.
[31:12.380 --> 31:13.680]  Yes, you could draft a horseshoe.
[31:14.080 --> 31:15.200]  It's not a horse. It's a horseshoe.
[31:15.260 --> 31:16.240]  Oh, man, I didn't think a horseshoe.
[31:16.840 --> 31:17.700]  It's a shoe for a horse.
[31:20.080 --> 31:25.980]  If somebody walked to you a horseshoe, would you ever say, get that horse out of here?
[31:26.700 --> 31:30.500]  Fine. You're playing a game called horseshoes.
[31:30.600 --> 31:31.260]  Oh, shit.
[31:32.140 --> 31:32.940]  Oh, that would work.
[31:33.960 --> 31:35.440]  I think it works either way.
[31:35.640 --> 31:41.220]  I'm confused about what you're confused about at this point. It feels like this definitely makes...
[31:41.220 --> 31:46.420]  I just don't know if it fully qualifies as not horse, but it's horse-related.
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.280]  Everything we're touching in this draft is horse-related, man.
[31:50.300 --> 31:51.900]  Yeah, I don't...
[31:51.900 --> 31:53.760]  What's a horseradish got to do with a horse?
[31:54.280 --> 31:55.200]  It's in the name.
[31:55.680 --> 31:58.000]  What's a seahorse got to do with a horse?
[31:58.280 --> 31:59.080]  It's in the name!
[31:59.400 --> 32:00.660]  It's in the name!
[32:01.100 --> 32:05.760]  They saw that creature and they said, holy shit, that looks like a horse in the water.
[32:06.100 --> 32:07.400]  I know, a seahorse.
[32:08.080 --> 32:11.200]  You'd never see them together, though. A seahorse doesn't know anything about a horse.
[32:11.340 --> 32:13.340]  You'd never see them together.
[32:14.900 --> 32:17.700]  You think a horse knows what a horseshoe is?
[32:20.080 --> 32:26.400]  You just... we said... you said horseshoe and then you said horse hat, and I just want to...
[32:26.400 --> 32:28.180]  Is that the thumbnail?
[32:30.580 --> 32:31.380]  That's great.
[32:31.840 --> 32:34.760]  That might be... that should probably be the thumbnail for this, right?
[32:34.820 --> 32:35.380]  Yeah, probably.
[32:35.600 --> 32:37.620]  It's pretty good. It's a pretty good horse.
[32:37.940 --> 32:40.360]  So would you allow, like... would you allow horse fur?
[32:41.360 --> 32:42.140]  Horse fur?
[32:43.800 --> 32:45.680]  What is horse fur?
[32:46.380 --> 32:47.220]  It's not real, is it?
[32:47.240 --> 32:48.920]  I mean, you can pick it. It's a terrible pick.
[32:49.280 --> 32:50.020]  Because it's horse hair.
[32:50.700 --> 32:53.780]  I just don't understand why this conversation wasn't had with horse power.
[32:54.460 --> 32:59.520]  Yeah, because horse power is used for cars and stuff, and there's actually a horse nearby.
[32:59.860 --> 33:03.640]  Yeah, but it was named specifically in relation to horses.
[33:04.080 --> 33:07.020]  Yeah, I've seen horse play. It was named because horses play.
[33:07.180 --> 33:09.300]  But it doesn't mean there's a horse when there's horse play.
[33:10.740 --> 33:16.020]  So if you bought a shirt, is that the same to you as, like, having a human?
[33:16.260 --> 33:17.180]  Is that a person?
[33:26.220 --> 33:33.700]  If somebody... if, like, when we bring shirts into... like, if we import shirts, are you worried that we're human trafficking?
[33:34.260 --> 33:39.200]  I just think if it was human, not human, you wouldn't pick human shirt. I just don't think that'd be on your list.
[33:39.200 --> 33:45.660]  Yeah, because nobody says human shirt as a thing. It's not a turn of phrase. It's not a game people play.
[33:46.220 --> 33:49.720]  Like, do you realize... you recognize the difference between horse hat and horse shoe, right?
[33:49.980 --> 33:55.180]  Like, if you say horse shoe, 99 people out of 100 are going to be able to draw one from memory.
[33:55.580 --> 33:57.800]  If you say horse hat, 99 people are going to be like, what?
[33:59.240 --> 34:00.480]  Did Mr. Ed wear a hat?
[34:01.080 --> 34:05.840]  I mean, probably in, like, an episode, but I think he just... like, by and large, no.
[34:06.100 --> 34:07.420]  Maybe when he went out to town.
[34:07.420 --> 34:08.640]  That's what I was thinking.
[34:09.260 --> 34:10.800]  That horse ate a lot of peanut butter.
[34:11.480 --> 34:13.960]  Yeah, he did. He was a happy horse.
[34:14.060 --> 34:19.320]  Well, horse armor DLC from Oblivion is on the board, whether Gavin likes it or not, I guess.
[34:20.880 --> 34:27.300]  It's weird, I do feel a way about it, but I don't even know if it's a good pick or a shit pick. I just don't know.
[34:27.400 --> 34:27.840]  It's good!
[34:28.360 --> 34:28.600]  Okay.
[34:34.280 --> 34:38.200]  I really just blew off both my feet with horseradish as my first pick.
[34:38.880 --> 34:42.420]  I want to argue, but I should just keep my mouth shut for the rest of the draw.
[34:45.540 --> 34:52.960]  Well, the horse armor DLC is on the board, and Andrew, you're going to kick us off with the fourth and final round of the Horse Not Horse draft.
[34:53.040 --> 34:55.360]  What is your fourth and final pick?
[34:55.360 --> 35:04.740]  My fourth and final pick is the thing that's always fun to see because you go, oh, oh, and it's so, so lethal. It's illegal.
[35:05.180 --> 35:07.340]  I'm going with horse collar tackles.
[35:07.760 --> 35:09.140]  Oh, that's good!
[35:09.820 --> 35:14.040]  I really like that one. Not on my list. Should have been.
[35:14.400 --> 35:15.840]  I don't even know what that is. What is that?
[35:16.540 --> 35:21.840]  It's when you grab somebody from like the back of their shoulder pads and pull them down.
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.660]  So you're not you're not allowed to like grip and use your weight to like shove like it stops all their momentum.
[35:28.020 --> 35:33.200]  It happens. You'll see it. It's always like, oh, oh, that was a horse collar.
[35:33.780 --> 35:39.600]  See, I just dropped a picture in the discord of it where a guy is getting brought down with a horse collar tackle.
[35:39.820 --> 35:45.240]  And it's just imagine running as fast as you can and somebody yanks you cartoon style by the back of your shirt.
[35:45.460 --> 35:46.660]  Led to a lot of knee injuries.
[35:47.060 --> 35:47.700]  So many.
[35:47.700 --> 35:49.160]  A lot of injuries in general.
[35:49.580 --> 35:51.800]  Yeah, yes, it is. It's an illegal move now.
[35:51.900 --> 35:52.540]  It's a big no-no.
[35:53.540 --> 35:54.020]  Interesting.
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.420]  You cool with that one?
[35:58.120 --> 35:59.060]  Yeah, that's a great pick.
[35:59.600 --> 36:00.080]  Excellent.
[36:01.120 --> 36:03.000]  Even though it's talking about a horse's collar.
[36:03.440 --> 36:08.660]  Geoff, you have your final pick. This is the fourth and final round.
[36:08.780 --> 36:10.580]  So what is your last horse not horse pick?
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.480]  It's not actual horse's collar.
[36:16.780 --> 36:18.240]  You ever seen a horse wear a shirt?
[36:18.900 --> 36:19.820]  They do sometimes.
[36:20.340 --> 36:21.080]  Yeah, in Oblivion.
[36:22.200 --> 36:23.880]  Yeah, and those have collars.
[36:27.880 --> 36:32.960]  Much like I think Andrew's earlier pick, somebody's earlier pick, this kind of horse is a cautionary tale.
[36:33.160 --> 36:35.640]  It's not the kind you want to receive.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.040]  Maybe at first you think you do, but then when you peer behind the curtain, you realize that it was a mistake.
[36:41.040 --> 36:46.240]  I'm talking about, obviously, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth.
[36:49.380 --> 36:50.300]  Don't do it.
[36:50.980 --> 36:52.380]  Yeah, you shouldn't do that.
[36:52.720 --> 36:53.680]  You should not do that.
[36:54.000 --> 36:54.500]  Halitosis.
[36:55.180 --> 37:03.680]  I think the phrase comes from genuinely looking at a gift horse in the mouth because that's how you can tell it's health, right?
[37:03.880 --> 37:04.680]  Yes, exactly.
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.620]  Oh, I thought it was like a Trojan horse situation.
[37:11.100 --> 37:16.740]  You're saying if somebody gives you a giant wooden horse, don't look at what's inside of it because it might be people?
[37:17.080 --> 37:20.920]  No, don't look in the mouth because it's just wooden teeth. Look in the butt. That's where the people are.
[37:21.500 --> 37:22.260]  Oh, yeah.
[37:22.880 --> 37:23.620]  They were all over.
[37:23.980 --> 37:25.620]  Is it really not from ancient...
[37:26.620 --> 37:36.640]  No, I'm pretty sure it is. I mean, it's probably a very old idiom, but I'm pretty sure it is about looking at a horse's teeth in front of the person who's gifting you the horse so you can check its health.
[37:37.320 --> 37:38.920]  Yeah, it would be considered rude.
[37:40.220 --> 37:43.280]  There were so many less things to gift people back then.
[37:44.680 --> 37:48.640]  Just like a horse is one of history's classic gifts, so I just assumed.
[37:49.700 --> 37:58.120]  I'm just imagining Gavin in a nearby town to when, let's say, the Trojan horse thing actually happened and Gavin's like sitting at the fire going,
[37:58.200 --> 38:03.260]  Oh, that's what happens when you don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Should have looked in it. Should have seen it.
[38:03.660 --> 38:04.820]  The Trojan horse.
[38:09.620 --> 38:14.120]  Well, not looking a gift horse in the mouth is Geoff's fourth and final pick.
[38:14.920 --> 38:21.620]  My final pick, I'm going to try for, this is from, this is my wife's suggestion.
[38:21.940 --> 38:24.600]  She wanted me to call out that was my wife's suggestion.
[38:26.060 --> 38:30.540]  I'm doing it here because I'm going to drop it down and we'll see what happens.
[38:31.200 --> 38:36.080]  In the horse, not horse draft, my wife's pick that wanted me to pick was horse.
[38:37.120 --> 38:37.640]  Horse?
[38:38.460 --> 38:46.000]  Now here's the thing. This was my wife's suggestion. What do you boys think of that pick?
[38:46.500 --> 38:48.580]  Well, let me ask you this. Is it horse?
[38:52.250 --> 38:52.770]  What?
[38:55.070 --> 38:59.250]  Well, it's got to be horse, right? But not horse.
[38:59.450 --> 39:00.550]  Horse, yeah.
[39:00.550 --> 39:08.970]  Is it the thing that it kind of sounds like horse or is it like, is it a word that is related to horses in some form?
[39:09.550 --> 39:11.330]  Yeah, I mean, you see it written right there.
[39:11.550 --> 39:15.490]  Is there a dialect where someone sounds like horse where they say when it's horse?
[39:15.950 --> 39:17.350]  Yeah, I think most people probably.
[39:17.730 --> 39:19.490]  I don't think so. You don't think so?
[39:20.250 --> 39:22.050]  No. Gavin, how do you say it?
[39:23.210 --> 39:25.070]  What he just wrote? Horse.
[39:25.630 --> 39:26.490]  Yeah, okay.
[39:26.490 --> 39:31.030]  Yeah, I'm struggling to see the connection.
[39:31.430 --> 39:40.930]  Hey, then you're right. You know, let me get it off the board. I'll let Barbara know that her pick did not stand because with that, and this is the thing I want you guys to get off, and that's your high horse.
[39:42.450 --> 39:43.230]  Oh, good one.
[39:45.610 --> 39:47.910]  You set us up there, you son of a bitch. That was good, though.
[39:48.030 --> 39:49.250]  That's good. That's real good.
[39:50.630 --> 39:52.490]  You know what? I tell you what, put horse back there.
[39:54.590 --> 39:58.110]  I thought it was going to, like, turn out to be French for, like, Mustang.
[40:01.750 --> 40:03.670]  I have a follow up question for your wife.
[40:04.030 --> 40:06.850]  Sure. Are mermaids seahorses?
[40:08.570 --> 40:09.810]  It's fucked up.
[40:16.790 --> 40:19.290]  Because I'd go for that if we were allowing your original pick.
[40:23.090 --> 40:25.090]  Why would that be what mermaids are?
[40:25.950 --> 40:26.650]  I don't know.
[40:27.290 --> 40:28.970]  I don't know about mermaids.
[40:33.610 --> 40:35.930]  Well, this one got away from us a little bit.
[40:38.770 --> 40:43.030]  Horseradish sauce and then horseradish made sure it started away from us.
[40:44.610 --> 40:45.770]  We like to have fun.
[40:46.770 --> 40:48.910]  Everybody knows we like to have fun.
[40:51.990 --> 40:55.370]  Well, that's my fourth and final pick for the horse, not horse draft.
[40:55.630 --> 40:58.010]  And Gavin, what is your last pick?
[40:58.550 --> 40:59.790]  Well, I love...
[41:03.190 --> 41:05.370]  I love watching gymnastics, right?
[41:11.490 --> 41:15.770]  You look at some people doing flips and you think, bloody hell, that looks impossible. I couldn't do that.
[41:16.050 --> 41:18.830]  You look at people farting about with that ribbon. Couldn't do that either.
[41:18.910 --> 41:22.530]  But there's one thing I look at and I think, I'm pretty sure I could do that.
[41:23.170 --> 41:24.670]  It's the frickin' pommel horse.
[41:24.950 --> 41:27.910]  Yeah, the pommel horse is, I think...
[41:27.910 --> 41:30.350]  It looks like entry-level gymnastics.
[41:30.930 --> 41:34.890]  Yeah, I definitely don't think you could do it, but that's a great pick on this.
[41:35.170 --> 41:35.850]  Definitely not.
[41:36.170 --> 41:37.950]  The bit where they swing their legs under the hands?
[41:38.350 --> 41:41.710]  Let's see it. We gotta get you access to a pommel horse.
[41:42.130 --> 41:45.090]  You think you could swing your legs under your hands?
[41:46.050 --> 41:48.690]  How long do I have to try and master this?
[41:48.910 --> 41:52.010]  I just think you should just do it today. You said that it looked beginner.
[41:53.410 --> 41:58.730]  I would say within 15 minutes of entering the location where it exists.
[41:58.930 --> 41:59.210]  Yeah.
[41:59.770 --> 42:01.510]  Can I get 45?
[42:01.950 --> 42:03.030]  45 minutes?
[42:03.530 --> 42:03.710]  Yeah.
[42:05.130 --> 42:10.750]  You're gonna get worn out after like 5 minutes, so you can have an hour if you'd like.
[42:11.210 --> 42:11.910]  I'll take the hour, yeah.
[42:11.910 --> 42:20.710]  You would be so exhausted trying to do this within 5 minutes. You would be exhausted.
[42:21.610 --> 42:23.810]  There's no fucking way.
[42:24.110 --> 42:25.590]  Maybe I'll get stronger as it goes.
[42:26.270 --> 42:29.290]  You gotta admit though, it does look easier than some of the other stuff.
[42:29.570 --> 42:31.950]  I think it's all brutal.
[42:32.290 --> 42:33.750]  It doesn't look easier than the ribbon.
[42:34.270 --> 42:39.790]  I'm just trying to picture Gavin being on one hand as he swings his legs around his side.
[42:40.390 --> 42:43.910]  You're only briefly on one hand though, it's just momentum really.
[42:44.050 --> 42:48.570]  Right, and I don't think you can briefly be on one hand. I think it's so tough.
[42:49.030 --> 42:50.590]  I think it's incredibly tough.
[42:50.850 --> 42:51.370]  You might be right.
[42:51.610 --> 42:57.390]  I feel like I remember when GSP was fighting, he would do gymnastics for core and balance,
[42:57.530 --> 43:02.610]  and he would vocalize that it was the most physically exhausting thing he would do in training.
[43:02.910 --> 43:06.790]  How many leg laps am I doing of my Humble Horse?
[43:06.790 --> 43:08.530]  You know what? I think as many as you can.
[43:08.530 --> 43:15.650]  Yeah, I think you have to prove that it's an easy thing by doing as many as you can, whether that is one or one hundred.
[43:16.470 --> 43:21.170]  Can I make a quick aside on things that we can't do that I was thinking about last night?
[43:21.450 --> 43:21.970]  Absolutely.
[43:22.510 --> 43:24.510]  That I'd love for you guys to do.
[43:24.870 --> 43:35.470]  I was watching racing, and I thought it would be so goddamn funny to see the four of you work a pit and try to change a tire as fast as you can.
[43:35.630 --> 43:36.830]  I would love that.
[43:36.830 --> 43:38.050]  That would be very cool.
[43:38.110 --> 43:39.870]  That would be phenomenal.
[43:41.190 --> 43:42.930]  That's a really good one. That's a good idea.
[43:44.270 --> 43:46.750]  Well, Pummel Horse is on the board. That's Gavin's fourth and final pick.
[43:47.610 --> 43:50.070]  I wonder if there's something that Nick could steal from that.
[43:50.170 --> 43:54.410]  Either way, Nick has the final pick here in the Horse Not Horse draft.
[43:54.630 --> 43:59.290]  No, it is on my list, but you guys know me. You know I love to have fun.
[43:59.530 --> 44:01.810]  You know I like a little bit of wordplay.
[44:01.810 --> 44:08.850]  So I'm going with horse, which is the act of sounding rough or harsh, typically as the result of a sore throat or shouting.
[44:09.090 --> 44:11.470]  Yeah, I had that on my list. That's a good one.
[44:11.670 --> 44:12.590]  I had horse voice.
[44:13.330 --> 44:14.170]  Horse throat.
[44:16.010 --> 44:17.070]  Pretty good. Horse.
[44:17.250 --> 44:20.710]  If somebody would have drafted other horse armor, Gavin would have this.
[44:28.730 --> 44:39.100]  Well, there you have it. This is the Horse Not Horse draft.
[44:39.540 --> 44:42.400]  We've done it. We've picked all the Horse Not Horses.
[44:43.340 --> 44:47.340]  Here's Nick's selection. It might sound similar to Gavin's.
[44:47.780 --> 44:52.420]  Horseradish sauce, horsing around, horse shit, and horse throat or voice.
[44:52.420 --> 44:57.980]  Gavin, horseradish, horseplay, seahorse, and pommel horse.
[44:58.540 --> 45:04.960]  I have chosen the 1965 Ford Mustang, Italian Stallion 1970, ponytail, and your high horse.
[45:05.620 --> 45:13.300]  Geoff has chosen Gary Dellabatte, Michael Horse, Funeral Horse, the band, and not looking, a gift horse in the mouth.
[45:13.900 --> 45:23.540]  And finally, Andrew has chosen Horse, the game, Horse Power, Horse Armor DLC from Oblivion, and Horse Collar Tackles.
[45:23.800 --> 45:29.320]  That is the Horse Not Horse draft, but boys, what are your honorable mentions? What didn't make the list?
[45:29.820 --> 45:34.660]  I have one that I was really disappointed I couldn't use because I misremembered their name.
[45:34.660 --> 45:45.960]  In the movie Antichrist, Willem Dafoe had a stunt penis, had a stand and a body double, and I thought his name was Horse, and I went back and confirmed, and it's Horst.
[45:46.480 --> 45:54.360]  So it's not how I would use it. But I was so excited when I remembered his horse penis potential thing.
[45:54.740 --> 46:00.300]  I had to scour YouTube trying to find the interview where he talked about it and was so disappointed. It was so close.
[46:00.880 --> 46:04.660]  Most of mine got picked. I think the only one I see that no one picked was a clothes horse.
[46:06.040 --> 46:13.920]  I'm sorry? A what? A clothes horse? A clothes horse. What the hell is that? What is a clothes horse? You dry your clothes on it. You hang clothes on it.
[46:15.500 --> 46:22.500]  Clothing line? Oh, I've never, I've never, I mean, I've seen these. I didn't know there was like a term for it. It's just, it's like a vertical.
[46:22.900 --> 46:26.160]  Oh, yeah, I didn't know that. I have one of those. I didn't know that's what it was called.
[46:26.160 --> 46:31.380]  Oh, what do you call it? Drying rack? Yeah. Drying rack. Place where I put my laundry. Oh, okay.
[46:32.100 --> 46:38.820]  No, that's cool. I didn't know that. I have OJ's Bronco. The Denver Broncos.
[46:40.340 --> 46:48.660]  I also have, and I was wondering if this would fit or not, but I decided ultimately to leave it off the list because I didn't feel that strongly about it.
[46:51.700 --> 47:01.460]  Centaurs. That's a great one. Right? It felt, it felt good, but I didn't love it when I had so many other things to choose from, but is definitely on my list.
[47:01.600 --> 47:08.160]  Oh, one horse town was another one that I had. That's a good one. Yeah, these are, these are horse things.
[47:08.160 --> 47:18.260]  I had a, I had mule because they're, it's true. I mean, yeah, it is. It's, it's, it is both a horse and not a horse. Yeah. Yes, exactly.
[47:18.640 --> 47:29.800]  And then I had Charlie horse. Oh yeah. Oh, that's, that's pretty good. That one though. It's funny because I didn't realize this, but I guess the term originated in the eighties or this is what they alleged.
[47:29.860 --> 47:36.080]  Anyway, that baseball players named those leg cramps after a horse named Charlie that helped the groundskeepers where the White Sox played.
[47:36.540 --> 47:42.220]  Huh? What the fuck? I was like, Oh, cool. Whatever. History, I guess. Maybe. Interesting.
[47:42.760 --> 47:50.560]  I still had six. I had a hobby horse, a saw horse, uh, the phrase, that's horse feathers. Oh, that's pretty good.
[47:50.840 --> 47:59.360]  The movie, the Western movie, A Man Called Horse. This thing that my father-in-law got very excited about and told me all about when I was explaining what we were doing today.
[47:59.360 --> 48:06.920]  There's this place in the ocean called the horse latitudes where the, the water's really still, uh, and the horse horses on ships like it.
[48:07.040 --> 48:15.120]  And then, uh, this one, which I thought was not going to fly, but I wanted to try it anyway. The TV show, uh, put it in the discord right now.
[48:15.420 --> 48:24.560]  Shorezy, which is spelled without the word horse. Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, pretty good. Uh, but that was, I mean, horse is the same thing, isn't it? Yeah, pretty much.
[48:24.960 --> 48:33.160]  Okay. Uh, what about, isn't horse apple a thing? Yeah, horse, yeah. Nobody picked horse apple. Wait, so there's a horse apple and a crab apple.
[48:33.640 --> 48:42.300]  Wonder what other animal apples are. Whoa, animal apples. Whoa, crazy. Time for apple, not apple. Um. Horse apple's fucking ugly. Anyone else, any other honorable mentions?
[48:42.980 --> 48:49.280]  I was surprised when I picked horse shit, Gavin didn't go with horse hockey. Hmm. I don't even know what that is. Is that the same thing as horse shit?
[48:49.480 --> 48:53.820]  Yeah, I was going to say, I don't think that's probably a phrase he's ever heard. It's like the same thing. Yeah. Wow.
[48:54.560 --> 49:00.720]  There you go. Horse apple. Wow, it's hideous. Yep. Well, boys, that's the horse, not horse draft. Thank you for listening.
[49:01.140 --> 49:12.960]  Don't forget, we'll have a poll up and you can let us know who had the best horse, not horse list. If you vote for Nick or Gavin, you're... half of their list is the same thing.
[49:13.820 --> 49:17.780]  They're different. A vote for one of them is a vote for both of them, I suppose.
[49:19.100 --> 49:28.060]  Thank you so much for watching patreon.com slash the regulation pod. Also check out our YouTube channels where we have the podcast go up on one and the other one is our game plays.
[49:28.220 --> 49:36.920]  So if you've just seen this draft and thought, wow, what interesting horse picks, come watch us play ultimate chicken horse. Another thing we could have drafted on this list.
[49:36.920 --> 49:42.660]  Oh shit. We definitely could have. Yep. There you go. All right, boys, that's it. Horse, not horse draft. How you feeling?
[49:43.780 --> 49:51.620]  Fantastic. Good. I'm feet galloping into victory. Okay. All right. We'll see you later. Thanks for... he's beating his table. Thanks for listening. Bye.
