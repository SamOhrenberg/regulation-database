[00:00.000 --> 00:03.300]  Hello and welcome to another regulation draft.
[00:03.560 --> 00:07.160]  This is one that I hope might become a yearly draft.
[00:07.280 --> 00:10.240]  This is the 2025 regulation
[00:11.500 --> 00:13.080]  nickname draft generator.
[00:13.280 --> 00:17.140]  What we are going to do is each one of us has come up with an...
[00:17.140 --> 00:19.720]  And by the way, I should say this is Gavin's idea, as all our...
[00:19.720 --> 00:20.660]  I'm going to say Gavin's idea.
[00:20.900 --> 00:24.260]  I feel a little bit weird leading this one because this was 100% his idea.
[00:24.660 --> 00:26.860]  But I'm going to do my best.
[00:27.060 --> 00:29.160]  OK, so what we're going to do is we each
[00:29.160 --> 00:33.040]  offscreen came up with one nickname for each of the other people in regulation.
[00:33.180 --> 00:36.960]  We are then going to snake draft it to list everybody's nicknames.
[00:37.060 --> 00:39.540]  Then we will all end up with four potential nicknames.
[00:39.880 --> 00:44.060]  What we'll do at that point is spin a wheel and let Chance describe
[00:44.060 --> 00:49.580]  what our nickname for the year 2025 is going to be.
[00:49.880 --> 00:51.260]  Did I do a good job of explaining that, Gavin?
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.920]  Fantastic, Geoff. Great job.
[00:53.240 --> 00:53.800]  All right. Great.
[00:54.280 --> 00:56.900]  It's always hard to translate somebody else's vision, you know?
[00:56.980 --> 00:57.800]  Yeah, I know.
[00:57.800 --> 00:59.080]  The important...
[00:59.080 --> 00:59.680]  Yeah. No, go ahead.
[00:59.900 --> 01:01.000]  Oh, yeah, go ahead. Sorry.
[01:01.360 --> 01:02.440]  Was this your idea, Geoff?
[01:02.920 --> 01:05.560]  I think it's pretty clear that it was yours based on everything I just said.
[01:06.860 --> 01:08.260]  Now, this one's nothing to do with me.
[01:08.800 --> 01:10.780]  I would never take credit for an idea that wasn't mine.
[01:11.100 --> 01:13.840]  Listen, I already wrote my nickname down for you, so I can't pick humble.
[01:13.960 --> 01:14.820]  But God, would I?
[01:17.940 --> 01:20.500]  OK, so the way this is going to work is
[01:21.060 --> 01:22.720]  we're going to randomize the names.
[01:22.880 --> 01:26.660]  And then when you're randomized, imagine that what's happening
[01:26.660 --> 01:28.760]  left to right is also going from top to bottom.
[01:29.160 --> 01:33.300]  So in this Antigua order, Andrew would never pick a nickname for himself.
[01:33.580 --> 01:35.500]  Neither would Nick, me, Geoff, Gavin.
[01:35.640 --> 01:36.980]  So those will remain X's.
[01:37.100 --> 01:40.380]  But this first round, if we use this order, would be Andrew.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.340]  So let's randomize.
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.660]  But how many times are we going to randomize?
[01:45.300 --> 01:46.440]  Five, because it's 2025.
[01:47.380 --> 01:49.080]  We did do five for our last draft.
[01:49.500 --> 01:50.560]  I don't know if that's a factor.
[01:51.480 --> 01:53.020]  Six, because it's one more than the last draft.
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.800]  Hell yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:54.900 --> 01:56.320]  All right. Here comes six.
[01:56.320 --> 01:57.820]  Gavin didn't have anything to say about it.
[01:57.860 --> 01:58.760]  This wasn't his idea. Here we go.
[01:58.820 --> 02:02.220]  One, two, three, four, five.
[02:02.520 --> 02:04.480]  Nick, Geoff, Andrew, Eric, Gavin.
[02:04.720 --> 02:05.300]  And finally.
[02:06.640 --> 02:07.780]  Oh, six.
[02:08.720 --> 02:12.600]  This is Nick, Andrew, Eric, Geoff, Gavin.
[02:12.780 --> 02:16.860]  So this first round of the nicknames draft
[02:16.860 --> 02:21.480]  will be everyone giving Nick his nickname.
[02:21.920 --> 02:25.180]  Andrew, we start with you.
[02:26.320 --> 02:28.620]  My nickname for Nick, he's an audio guy.
[02:28.800 --> 02:29.540]  He's a sound guy.
[02:29.620 --> 02:32.460]  He brings you everything that you need.
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.540]  Thought about a lot of different options.
[02:35.020 --> 02:38.880]  Ended up with Schwartwave is my nickname for Nick.
[02:39.140 --> 02:43.220]  Oh, S-C-H-W-A-R-T wave.
[02:43.700 --> 02:45.460]  One word. Schwartwave.
[02:45.740 --> 02:46.020]  Uh-huh.
[02:46.800 --> 02:49.420]  I mean, it's like corporate the last name.
[02:49.520 --> 02:50.560]  He's an audio guy.
[02:50.600 --> 02:52.460]  Yeah, no, I get like, I get it.
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.120]  Like, it's cute.
[02:53.220 --> 02:55.520]  I don't like to say I don't like saying it.
[02:55.520 --> 02:56.860]  Like, it doesn't feel good.
[02:56.940 --> 02:59.620]  I feel a lot better saying that than his gamertag.
[02:59.780 --> 03:00.840]  I'll tell you that much.
[03:01.440 --> 03:04.680]  It sounds like something that's very dirty in the urban dictionary.
[03:05.020 --> 03:06.460]  Yeah. Oh, Schwartwave.
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.020]  Oh, yeah. Like, oh, I took a Schwartwave last night.
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.500]  Yeah, I've been very innocent in my thinking of it,
[03:11.520 --> 03:13.220]  but I completely see where you're coming from.
[03:13.220 --> 03:13.920]  Yeah. Yeah.
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.460]  I feel like the lack of the Z really draws attention to the wart.
[03:17.940 --> 03:20.120]  Yeah. Yeah. It's a little heavy.
[03:20.720 --> 03:22.000]  It is very wart heavy.
[03:22.200 --> 03:24.240]  Well, Nick, maybe that won't be your nickname.
[03:24.240 --> 03:26.640]  Maybe your nickname will be the one that I pick for you.
[03:26.700 --> 03:29.640]  And when I think of it, when I think of Nick, I only think of one thing
[03:30.240 --> 03:31.620]  and that's Showbiz, baby.
[03:31.900 --> 03:33.580]  Yeah, I love it.
[03:33.800 --> 03:36.760]  That's the showbiz Nick.
[03:39.100 --> 03:40.680]  I think for a year,
[03:41.240 --> 03:44.640]  if we called Nick Elwes of Showbiz, I think that's great.
[03:45.020 --> 03:46.920]  I think Showbiz is a great nickname for Nick.
[03:49.280 --> 03:51.120]  Why? What do you mean?
[03:51.180 --> 03:53.080]  I'm thinking Nick, baby. I'm thinking Showbiz.
[03:53.080 --> 03:54.740]  I know. Hey, finger guns.
[03:54.900 --> 03:55.860]  Yeah, I don't think of Showbiz.
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.600]  To me, imagining like Glasses movie, cool guy.
[03:59.800 --> 04:00.840]  And Nick is not that.
[04:01.220 --> 04:04.500]  Now I'm just imagining him doing jazz hands into one of those mirrors
[04:04.500 --> 04:07.040]  with all the light bulbs around. Yeah. Oh, I like that.
[04:07.180 --> 04:09.460]  Oh, I like that. I don't like Showbiz as much.
[04:10.120 --> 04:12.360]  I hope Showbiz is the one that gets fixed.
[04:13.800 --> 04:15.380]  Oh, this wheel is going to be so much fun.
[04:15.760 --> 04:19.220]  Uh-huh. Well, that's that's where we're at right now.
[04:19.480 --> 04:22.000]  And Geoff, what's your nickname for Nick?
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.300]  Well, I must admit, I had the most nicknames for Nick.
[04:25.540 --> 04:28.740]  Oh, really? Because I think it's well, I think it's hilarious.
[04:28.840 --> 04:33.700]  And and there's a palpable irony in the fact that his name is in the title
[04:33.700 --> 04:37.520]  of this draft. Nick is the first part of Nickname, right?
[04:37.680 --> 04:39.820]  So you could call him the apostrophe.
[04:40.280 --> 04:41.280]  You could call him.
[04:41.540 --> 04:44.200]  I thought paper cut because Nick is a paper cut. Right.
[04:44.420 --> 04:46.860]  But then I thought, what do I really know most about Nick?
[04:46.880 --> 04:49.540]  And I know two things that are indelible about Nick.
[04:49.580 --> 04:51.420]  I know he wears a monkey mask sometimes.
[04:51.420 --> 04:54.700]  And I know that in the year 2025, he will appear at a mall
[04:54.700 --> 04:56.640]  somewhere in America in giant red boots.
[04:56.740 --> 05:00.200]  And I thought, who who exemplifies those two qualities?
[05:00.780 --> 05:04.380]  Boots from Dora the Explorer is a monkey that wears red boots.
[05:04.500 --> 05:06.720]  I put the picture up in the chat so you can see it.
[05:06.760 --> 05:08.640]  And so my nickname for Nick is Boots.
[05:08.840 --> 05:10.540]  Dude, Boots is a really good one.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.980]  Boots, I think it's a great one.
[05:12.180 --> 05:13.880]  Boots is such a good nickname, dude.
[05:13.980 --> 05:16.060]  That rocks. Boots is it. I love it.
[05:16.100 --> 05:17.380]  And that looks like Nick right there.
[05:17.780 --> 05:18.440]  Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
[05:18.860 --> 05:19.980]  Mm hmm. Hey, it's me.
[05:20.820 --> 05:22.700]  Hey, showbiz, calm down.
[05:25.240 --> 05:26.220]  Chill out, Boots.
[05:27.980 --> 05:29.500]  See, these all work.
[05:29.900 --> 05:31.640]  These are great. These are great.
[05:32.460 --> 05:35.400]  And that's that's three of the four nicknames.
[05:35.540 --> 05:39.260]  Now we leave it up to Gavin for the final nickname for Nick.
[05:40.140 --> 05:41.740]  Well, Nick's a real busy guy.
[05:42.160 --> 05:45.180]  Sometimes we want to film videos and, you know, Nick's off doing something
[05:45.730 --> 05:48.320]  all the time. His car's in the shop.
[05:48.940 --> 05:50.660]  His car's often in the shop.
[05:51.080 --> 05:54.440]  So my nickname for him is The Mechanic.
[05:58.340 --> 05:59.780]  Oh, real good.
[06:00.120 --> 06:02.180]  And I like a nickname that's like a role.
[06:02.320 --> 06:03.840]  It's like, you know, there's Jimmy, there's Steve.
[06:03.900 --> 06:05.000]  And just that's the mechanic.
[06:05.580 --> 06:07.080]  Yeah, that's pretty good.
[06:07.480 --> 06:09.000]  That that is pretty good.
[06:09.140 --> 06:11.500]  I'm so excited to see what your nickname is going to be now.
[06:13.460 --> 06:15.520]  Well, that's all of Nick's nicknames.
[06:15.520 --> 06:19.880]  I really like and that's Schwartwave Showbiz Boots and The Mechanic.
[06:20.580 --> 06:23.600]  Nick, how do you feel about those? You like them?
[06:23.860 --> 06:24.620]  I feel good.
[06:24.940 --> 06:28.540]  Of all of them, I think Schwartwave is the one that I want least.
[06:29.280 --> 06:32.740]  Really? Well, that one came from Andrew.
[06:33.020 --> 06:37.400]  And now it's time for you to nickname Andrew, because our second round
[06:37.400 --> 06:39.740]  is Andrew nicknames and we start with Nick.
[06:39.900 --> 06:44.300]  Oh, boy. Well, I was thinking, what do we know about Andrew?
[06:44.300 --> 06:46.120]  We know he's a Winnie the Pooh guy.
[06:46.460 --> 06:47.360]  OK, wear pants.
[06:48.880 --> 06:50.700]  But. His name is Andrew.
[06:52.380 --> 06:53.380]  That's also true.
[06:53.700 --> 06:57.240]  I kind of combine them into a fun little deal.
[06:57.480 --> 06:59.500]  He's going to be Andy Pants.
[07:00.100 --> 07:02.820]  Hate it. Absolutely hate it.
[07:02.940 --> 07:05.620]  Honestly, I love Andy Pants.
[07:05.800 --> 07:07.460]  I think that is a good nickname.
[07:07.900 --> 07:11.360]  Dude, you're like it's like a Joey Pants situation, dude.
[07:11.640 --> 07:13.120]  Yeah, I don't like pants.
[07:13.120 --> 07:14.600]  I don't like the name Andy.
[07:14.800 --> 07:17.700]  It's a double threat of things I do not enjoy.
[07:17.960 --> 07:21.320]  Nick, you just took a nickname away from me and I'm not even mad.
[07:21.440 --> 07:22.680]  Oh, no way.
[07:22.820 --> 07:26.100]  No, I didn't come up with Andy Pants, but I came up with something similar.
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.980]  Wow. I was thinking the same thing.
[07:28.100 --> 07:29.800]  Winnie the Pooh, Pooh Bear, Andrew.
[07:30.060 --> 07:31.160]  I came up with Drew Bear.
[07:31.740 --> 07:32.700]  I like that a lot.
[07:33.400 --> 07:35.040]  So much stronger than Drew Bear.
[07:35.200 --> 07:37.220]  Yeah. Well, Geoff's going to change his.
[07:37.320 --> 07:39.840]  But before we get to Geoff's, we got to get through mine.
[07:39.940 --> 07:41.180]  When I think of Andrew,
[07:41.180 --> 07:45.080]  there's only one thing that I think of, and that's Gizmo.
[07:45.680 --> 07:48.240]  Yeah! I like Gizmo. I'll take Gizmo.
[07:49.700 --> 07:51.040]  I love it. I don't mind that.
[07:51.280 --> 07:54.520]  See, I think he could be a Gizmo.
[07:55.140 --> 07:56.860]  Dude, oh, where's Gizmo?
[07:57.020 --> 07:58.980]  Oh, Gizmo's taking us through a crazy video.
[07:59.280 --> 08:00.840]  Oh, he's making us play some mischief.
[08:01.220 --> 08:02.500]  Yeah, he's doing something.
[08:02.980 --> 08:04.300]  Never know what Gizmo's up to.
[08:04.640 --> 08:06.040]  Oh, that right there? That's Gizmo.
[08:06.480 --> 08:07.140]  That's yeah.
[08:07.420 --> 08:09.460]  I'm feeling good about Gizmo as a nickname for Andrew.
[08:09.460 --> 08:12.080]  It's like, oh, no, Andrew's in Gizmo-ed again.
[08:13.420 --> 08:14.740]  This really works.
[08:14.960 --> 08:18.620]  I think Gavin's befuddled by my two nicknames so far.
[08:19.240 --> 08:20.420]  Topaz and Gizmo.
[08:20.740 --> 08:23.640]  It's like a piece of jank puppets.
[08:25.720 --> 08:27.720]  Keep that in mind as we get deeper.
[08:29.040 --> 08:30.680]  Geoff, what is your...
[08:30.680 --> 08:34.420]  We already know that you had an Andrew nickname that you're wiping off the board,
[08:34.540 --> 08:36.280]  but what's the one you're going to go with?
[08:36.540 --> 08:39.080]  It's OK. I'm going to go with my backup, which I like as well.
[08:39.080 --> 08:42.440]  One thing I think we all know about Andrew is that he is wholesome
[08:42.440 --> 08:46.140]  and wonderful and sweet and kind and gentle.
[08:46.280 --> 08:50.520]  And he's like, oh, he's like Andrew to me is like a big, warm hug. Right?
[08:50.600 --> 08:54.540]  Yeah. And I think that that's a it's great that we know that about him.
[08:54.580 --> 08:57.000]  But I also think that there's a darker side to Andrew.
[08:57.100 --> 08:58.040]  I know he's coming.
[08:58.940 --> 09:01.760]  He's got random Raymond Sommer in the background.
[09:01.760 --> 09:03.380]  Yeah, he's like a different person.
[09:03.520 --> 09:06.960]  He may or may not be affiliated with the Vancouver child kicker.
[09:06.960 --> 09:10.580]  We know he likes to watch women pee on at McDonald's.
[09:10.920 --> 09:13.580]  Like there there are these little dark elements that you see.
[09:13.940 --> 09:16.800]  But none of them can be truly tied to him.
[09:16.900 --> 09:20.340]  But what do we know about Andrew that we can tie to him?
[09:20.420 --> 09:24.500]  I want to toughen him up a little bit because we know how wholesome he is.
[09:24.540 --> 09:26.760]  But I want the world to feel a little bit of his edge.
[09:26.880 --> 09:29.560]  So I looked at like the last year and here's what I came up with.
[09:29.620 --> 09:31.880]  Andrew Panton, the Herman Miller killer.
[09:32.260 --> 09:33.140]  Oh, I like that.
[09:33.140 --> 09:34.780]  Whoa, what?
[09:34.920 --> 09:37.660]  They said it couldn't be done, but he did it.
[09:38.040 --> 09:40.580]  So the Herman Miller killer?
[09:41.180 --> 09:42.460]  Yeah, or Herman Miller killer, whatever.
[09:42.620 --> 09:43.500]  The Herman Miller killer. Yeah.
[09:43.960 --> 09:46.560]  OK, so you might just be shortened to Herman sometimes.
[09:47.940 --> 09:48.960]  Yeah, or killer.
[09:51.000 --> 09:51.880]  Or Miller.
[09:53.320 --> 09:55.920]  There's there's a lot of there's a lot at play.
[09:56.080 --> 09:58.700]  As long as it's not her killer, I'm OK with it.
[09:58.860 --> 10:00.320]  OK. All right.
[10:00.320 --> 10:06.360]  Um, well, Andrew's nickname for twenty twenty five could be the Herman Miller killer
[10:07.030 --> 10:08.220]  or the Herman Miller.
[10:08.420 --> 10:11.920]  It could be this next one that Gavin's going to lay down for us.
[10:12.560 --> 10:16.760]  Well, as we all know, Andrew needs to eat the goddamn pencil, right?
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.420]  Because we're still doing that, right?
[10:19.420 --> 10:23.640]  OK. Inside the pencil is what people used to think was lead.
[10:23.700 --> 10:24.600]  It was actually graphite.
[10:24.780 --> 10:26.500]  But people call it lead. Still do.
[10:27.000 --> 10:30.980]  On the periodic table, lead is represented by the letters P.B.
[10:31.440 --> 10:33.400]  Why is that? I looked it up.
[10:33.700 --> 10:35.500]  It's Latin for plumbum.
[10:37.140 --> 10:39.000]  I give you plumbum.
[10:39.460 --> 10:42.660]  Well, how are you feeling about Andy Pants now?
[10:43.480 --> 10:46.100]  I still have that rank at the bottom.
[10:46.760 --> 10:48.540]  I'll take plumbum over Andy Pants.
[10:48.880 --> 10:51.640]  Wow. That's how much I dislike Andy Pants.
[10:51.840 --> 10:54.860]  Now, I got to say of these names, you got to be praying for Gizmo.
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.860]  Ah, yeah, I think Gizmo is the best.
[10:58.820 --> 11:02.180]  I don't mind Herman Miller, Killer or Gizmo, that's for sure.
[11:02.680 --> 11:06.440]  But I definitely after Andy Pants, it was the first time it occurred to me
[11:06.440 --> 11:09.600]  I might not like any of the names on the wheel, and that is scary.
[11:12.500 --> 11:15.520]  Now, if it helps, that's all I've been thinking about is
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.520]  I'm not going to like any of the names on the wheel.
[11:17.540 --> 11:20.500]  But we go to me in the next round and it starts with Nick.
[11:20.780 --> 11:22.080]  Could you make it one word, by the way?
[11:22.080 --> 11:24.760]  Oh, is it plumb? It's just this? It's plumbum?
[11:25.040 --> 11:25.880]  Yeah. Oh, boy.
[11:26.400 --> 11:27.820]  OK. All right.
[11:28.100 --> 11:30.260]  Nick, this third round is Eric.
[11:30.700 --> 11:32.360]  All right. Well, what do we know about Eric?
[11:32.960 --> 11:35.840]  What do we know? We know he's he's he's tough under pressure.
[11:35.920 --> 11:37.200]  He holds it together. He's great.
[11:37.640 --> 11:39.440]  He's he's real solid.
[11:39.620 --> 11:42.220]  He's simple and easygoing.
[11:42.720 --> 11:46.340]  I have named Eric EZE.
[11:46.900 --> 11:48.560]  Whoa. OK.
[11:48.860 --> 11:51.620]  I I love it. I love it.
[11:51.620 --> 11:52.540]  That's great.
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.300]  And it's the one that I'm hoping for so far.
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.840]  And I have a feeling with the way the rest of this round is going to go,
[11:58.920 --> 12:01.820]  it's probably going to be the one I'm hoping for in the end.
[12:02.120 --> 12:05.260]  Isn't that? I mean, didn't the last EZE die of AIDS?
[12:05.700 --> 12:07.140]  He did. Yeah, but that's fine.
[12:07.200 --> 12:09.400]  I got to carry on that tradition.
[12:09.860 --> 12:11.780]  Oh, plus the name the name is free now, right?
[12:11.960 --> 12:14.400]  Also, that was easy. That was EZE with a Z.
[12:14.740 --> 12:16.440]  Z, that's excellent. Yeah, yeah.
[12:16.480 --> 12:18.080]  So there's a little difference.
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.940]  EZE, the first nickname for me.
[12:19.980 --> 12:20.820]  Andrew, what do you got?
[12:20.820 --> 12:25.700]  Oh, boy. OK, well, I'll put you can throw me on the you're not going to like a pile.
[12:26.100 --> 12:29.520]  Oh, shit. I thought about EZE,
[12:29.600 --> 12:32.180]  but I thought that that's already associated with somebody else.
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.480]  Had a bunch of different nicknames I ultimately landed on.
[12:36.560 --> 12:40.220]  There's there's as we've talked about a lot, things we know to be true.
[12:40.540 --> 12:45.720]  There's just indisputable evidence of you hanging out with a ratty boy
[12:45.720 --> 12:48.120]  being best friends with a ratty boy.
[12:48.120 --> 12:51.600]  So I figured what better nickname than Rat E-Boy?
[12:52.040 --> 12:55.040]  Rat capitalized E-Boy.
[12:56.740 --> 12:57.520]  Ratty boy.
[12:59.240 --> 13:01.660]  Yeah, at least you're right. I hate it.
[13:02.020 --> 13:03.960]  So like this. Yeah, that works.
[13:04.260 --> 13:05.760]  Oh, I like that. Ratty boy.
[13:06.200 --> 13:08.760]  Yeah, cool. I'm cool. I'm glad you guys like it.
[13:08.940 --> 13:12.040]  That's great. Well, don't really hold back for EZE on this one.
[13:12.480 --> 13:14.140]  Don't apologize for something you're not sorry for.
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.840]  Geoff, Geoff, don't hold off.
[13:16.840 --> 13:19.340]  You might listen. You haven't heard my nickname for you yet.
[13:19.360 --> 13:21.920]  And I took a lot into consideration when I picked it.
[13:21.960 --> 13:23.980]  And I think that there's a chance you might absolutely love it.
[13:24.040 --> 13:26.400]  And if you do, we'll learn a little bit something about you today.
[13:26.460 --> 13:28.240]  But I was thinking, what do I know about Eric?
[13:28.280 --> 13:30.920]  I know that he's a little guy. I know he has a small wife.
[13:31.020 --> 13:35.480]  I know that he I know that he he's the president of our company.
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.540]  I know he likes baseball and I know he like rats.
[13:37.680 --> 13:41.860]  So I put all those things together and I came up with a nickname for you
[13:41.860 --> 13:45.260]  that I think you'll absolutely love as the president of regulation.
[13:45.700 --> 13:49.360]  I think your new nickname could be Lil Trump.
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.280]  Dude, that's the craziest, like,
[13:54.020 --> 13:58.280]  I mean, just I mean, just so we're clear, I won't be taking that nickname
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.280]  no matter what, even if it lands on it, we'll just redo.
[14:02.620 --> 14:04.820]  So that's fine. I mean, that's up to you.
[14:05.060 --> 14:07.000]  I'm definitely not taking Lil Trump.
[14:07.780 --> 14:10.520]  God, you got to take whatever the wheel gives you.
[14:10.840 --> 14:11.640]  You got to take whatever.
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.460]  I think my nickname for Geoff is going to be Dumbfuck Stupid Asshole.
[14:15.680 --> 14:18.320]  And that's what he has to be for the rest of the year.
[14:18.440 --> 14:19.280]  That could be it.
[14:19.460 --> 14:21.800]  Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:22.040 --> 14:23.100]  OK, cool. Great.
[14:23.800 --> 14:26.480]  Gavin? Well, I'm going to go the opposite of Nick.
[14:26.620 --> 14:27.820]  Nick is focused on the E.
[14:28.540 --> 14:29.900]  I'm removing it completely.
[14:30.180 --> 14:32.240]  And I'm going to go with Lil Ricky B.
[14:33.700 --> 14:35.640]  That actually was a backup of mine.
[14:35.960 --> 14:40.500]  Lil Ricky B. Lil Ricky B. OK.
[14:40.500 --> 14:43.180]  There it is. Two Lils on the board.
[14:43.480 --> 14:47.720]  Eazy-E, Lil Rat-E-Boy, Lil Trump, which I won't be using.
[14:48.240 --> 14:50.540]  And Lil Ricky B. There you go.
[14:50.780 --> 14:54.200]  That's, uh, those are four nicknames.
[14:54.500 --> 14:58.340]  What I really like is that I've noticed the more preamble before the name,
[14:58.640 --> 15:02.260]  the more the person thinks that you're going to dislike it when they deliver it.
[15:02.500 --> 15:08.920]  So he gave Nick the nickname Boots and then he said Lil Trump.
[15:08.920 --> 15:12.220]  All right. Yeah, that's what seemed to fit, you know, man.
[15:12.320 --> 15:13.920]  Yeah, that's great. A hundred percent.
[15:14.300 --> 15:16.440]  Uh, because you're the president, he's the president.
[15:16.900 --> 15:19.000]  Might talk to the attorney and fold this company.
[15:21.080 --> 15:23.180]  Next is Geoff's nickname.
[15:23.740 --> 15:25.980]  And this is where you start.
[15:26.040 --> 15:26.900]  Nick, what do you have for Geoff?
[15:27.280 --> 15:28.300]  Well, what do we know about Geoff?
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.600]  We know he has a dog. He loves dogs.
[15:30.940 --> 15:33.340]  He is a big hot dog fan.
[15:33.420 --> 15:37.240]  He's the one that's going to eat as many hot dogs as the average man,
[15:37.240 --> 15:39.360]  according to that thing that Geoff found online.
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.400]  I think that we could do Doggy G interchangeable with G-Dog.
[15:45.600 --> 15:47.180]  I'll take it. I love Doggy G.
[15:47.460 --> 15:48.840]  I'll put a G-Dog or Doggy G.
[15:48.940 --> 15:50.740]  That's a really usable nickname.
[15:51.160 --> 15:52.040]  Yeah, I'll take it.
[15:52.760 --> 15:53.920]  Doggy G is pretty good.
[15:53.980 --> 15:58.660]  I like Doggy G. Did you imagine it, Nick, as D-O-G on G-Dog or D-A-W-G?
[15:59.180 --> 16:00.540]  D-O-G. There you go.
[16:00.960 --> 16:02.900]  Yeah, I feel like more of a D-O-G.
[16:03.120 --> 16:06.080]  Yeah, I just think because it's Doggy G,
[16:06.080 --> 16:08.240]  it should be G-Dog.
[16:08.800 --> 16:12.420]  But Andrew, it's your pick for Geoff's nickname.
[16:12.860 --> 16:17.860]  I was sweating during Nick's preamble because I only have one nickname for all
[16:17.860 --> 16:21.460]  of you, and mine also is hot dog related to Geoff.
[16:21.820 --> 16:24.600]  I'm glad we didn't go in the same lane.
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.360]  When I think of Geoff, two things that really stand out,
[16:28.440 --> 16:32.520]  his love of hot dogs and his love of Dallas.
[16:32.520 --> 16:35.520]  So what better way than to combine the two?
[16:35.940 --> 16:38.340]  My nickname for Geoff is Boss Dog.
[16:40.700 --> 16:43.420]  I want to see him walking around all white
[16:43.420 --> 16:45.980]  outfit, big cowboy hat, just chomping on the dogs.
[16:46.340 --> 16:48.040]  These are great names so far for Geoff.
[16:49.200 --> 16:50.360]  Double G on everybody.
[16:50.500 --> 16:52.400]  I think everybody's names are great, personally.
[16:53.380 --> 16:55.020]  I had some good names.
[16:56.200 --> 17:00.860]  I only had one nickname for Andrew and only one nickname for Nick.
[17:00.860 --> 17:04.440]  But I have one, two, three, four, five for Geoff.
[17:04.840 --> 17:07.540]  And the one I'm going to go with is Baby Pepsi.
[17:09.080 --> 17:09.960]  Baby Pepsi.
[17:10.700 --> 17:14.400]  Yeah. Oh, I might be my favorite so far, actually.
[17:14.680 --> 17:16.820]  I like that. I mean, just imagine walking into the room.
[17:16.940 --> 17:18.420]  There he is. Oh, dude, here he comes.
[17:18.540 --> 17:20.360]  Here comes Showbiz Gizmo and Baby Pepsi.
[17:20.980 --> 17:21.780]  Baby Pepsi.
[17:22.380 --> 17:24.820]  That's Baby Pepsi right there, dude. I love it.
[17:24.920 --> 17:26.220]  Yeah. There's Baby Pepsi.
[17:26.660 --> 17:27.280]  Thank you.
[17:27.700 --> 17:30.720]  I'm an animatronic in Nick's Showbiz Pizza.
[17:30.860 --> 17:32.600]  And we only serve Baby Pepsi.
[17:32.940 --> 17:33.440]  Baby Pepsi.
[17:34.100 --> 17:35.780]  Oh, she has Baby Pepsi products only, bitch.
[17:37.840 --> 17:40.620]  Gavin, you've known Geoff the longest, right?
[17:40.720 --> 17:42.820]  Like what kind of nickname you giving this guy?
[17:43.480 --> 17:45.920]  Well, his name is Geoffrey Lazer Ramsey.
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.340]  And I just thought I'd hack a few letters out of here and there, you know,
[17:50.340 --> 17:53.700]  maybe keep the G and the E of Geoff, maybe like the Z, you know.
[17:55.020 --> 17:55.420]  Geezer.
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.340]  Just straight up Geezer.
[17:58.340 --> 18:01.140]  Is it Geezer or Geeza?
[18:01.740 --> 18:03.100]  No, it's E-R because of...
[18:03.100 --> 18:04.020]  OK, just making sure.
[18:04.300 --> 18:07.460]  Like an old, like an incredibly old dude, Geezer.
[18:08.140 --> 18:08.920]  There's Geezer.
[18:09.440 --> 18:11.300]  I guess I am old. All right, I'll take it.
[18:11.900 --> 18:12.760]  There's Geezer.
[18:13.860 --> 18:18.800]  OK, we got the nicknames for four of the five members of the regulation crew.
[18:19.340 --> 18:22.060]  We finally go to Gavin and his nickname.
[18:22.180 --> 18:24.420]  So, Nick, what nickname are you giving to Gavin?
[18:24.900 --> 18:26.800]  Well, the thing about Gavin is he still
[18:26.800 --> 18:30.140]  hasn't figured out that goddamn CPAP machine.
[18:30.340 --> 18:30.860]  It's true, yeah.
[18:31.140 --> 18:33.260]  And he keeps being miserable.
[18:33.580 --> 18:36.280]  So I'm going to go ahead and call him Gassy Goo.
[18:42.220 --> 18:44.980]  Which is what he just made in the bathroom a few minutes ago.
[18:46.940 --> 18:49.160]  That's so accurate to the last thing I did.
[18:52.120 --> 18:54.860]  You already have Gabby Goo, so hello Gassy Goo.
[18:54.860 --> 18:55.820]  Oh, man.
[18:56.060 --> 18:57.520]  Oh, good God.
[18:58.220 --> 18:59.080]  Oh, that's great.
[19:00.140 --> 19:03.200]  Andrew, what nickname do you have for your friend Gavin?
[19:03.940 --> 19:05.680]  Gavin's the one I struggled the most with.
[19:05.820 --> 19:09.660]  I couldn't think of a great combination for a long time.
[19:09.720 --> 19:11.860]  I spent a lot of time thinking about it,
[19:12.140 --> 19:17.840]  eventually came to the conclusion of what's Gavin's name, Gavin Free.
[19:18.280 --> 19:19.480]  What is Gavin known for?
[19:19.580 --> 19:21.880]  Bird noises. My nickname for Gavin, Free Bird.
[19:22.400 --> 19:25.860]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[19:26.600 --> 19:27.920]  I really like that.
[19:28.080 --> 19:29.140]  I think that is great.
[19:29.760 --> 19:32.540]  I think doing a like a free thing is really good.
[19:32.600 --> 19:35.260]  I was just going I was going to just go like drop free.
[19:35.500 --> 19:36.300]  I'm like, I'll be free.
[19:36.420 --> 19:37.480]  Maybe that's an easy one.
[19:37.880 --> 19:40.140]  There's a couple of different things that I was going to go with.
[19:40.180 --> 19:42.180]  I was going to try to do like a bond thing or whatever.
[19:43.260 --> 19:44.740]  Kind of like, you know, like Gav Finger.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.280]  Like, I thought that would be like fun or whatever.
[19:46.480 --> 19:49.220]  But instead, I'm going with Lil Spooky.
[19:49.220 --> 19:49.580]  Lil Spooky.
[19:49.660 --> 19:50.760]  Lil Spooky.
[19:52.580 --> 19:53.060]  What?
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.860]  What if everybody's nickname is Lil in 2025?
[20:00.480 --> 20:01.840]  Lil's out there, I can see it.
[20:02.140 --> 20:03.200]  Why Lil Spooky?
[20:03.540 --> 20:06.500]  Hey, what's up everybody, it's Lil Spooky, Lil Ricky B.
[20:08.180 --> 20:10.860]  I don't think Lil Spooky is a thing
[20:10.860 --> 20:13.600]  that Gavin's ever been, which I like about his nickname.
[20:14.240 --> 20:15.700]  No one's ever feared me.
[20:16.080 --> 20:17.480]  It's like when you call a tall guy tiny.
[20:17.480 --> 20:18.900]  That's what I'm saying.
[20:19.720 --> 20:21.540]  Oh man, what's up, it's Lil Spooky.
[20:23.640 --> 20:24.580]  That's Lil Spooky.
[20:25.140 --> 20:28.820]  And now finally, Geoff, you've known this guy the longest, right?
[20:29.120 --> 20:29.340]  I have.
[20:29.420 --> 20:31.320]  What kind of nickname are you giving to him?
[20:31.680 --> 20:32.060]  Well,
[20:33.400 --> 20:34.200]  you know,
[20:35.300 --> 20:36.520]  Lil Boris Johnson.
[20:37.100 --> 20:38.580]  Gavin's been in my life for a very long time.
[20:38.800 --> 20:39.800]  Here comes the preamble.
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.920]  I've known a lot about Gavin.
[20:42.060 --> 20:44.500]  I feel like I have lived inside his head and vice versa.
[20:45.080 --> 20:47.440]  He's my best friend in the entire world.
[20:47.580 --> 20:52.520]  And so I wanted to really get something that kind of distills Gavin down to his pure essence.
[20:52.660 --> 20:57.160]  Like, what is, if you peel away all the layers of the onion, what are you left with?
[20:57.440 --> 21:02.680]  And that's why I think in 2025, Gavin's nickname should be Dan's Friend.
[21:04.240 --> 21:06.440]  Oh, holy shit.
[21:06.680 --> 21:08.420]  Oh my God.
[21:08.840 --> 21:10.020]  The water balloon kink guy?
[21:10.020 --> 21:15.840]  We have to call him Dan's Friend.
[21:19.560 --> 21:23.320]  So I'm just going to introduce myself as Dan's Friend to people who don't know him.
[21:23.800 --> 21:25.080]  Hi, I'm Dan's Friend Gavin.
[21:25.340 --> 21:26.840]  Hi, I'm Dan's Friend.
[21:27.480 --> 21:27.880]  Oh,
[21:28.520 --> 21:29.820]  I'm Dan's Friend Gavin.
[21:30.420 --> 21:32.140]  I've been watching about the whole morning.
[21:34.240 --> 21:39.280]  That is maybe the funniest way to describe Gavin is Dan's Friend.
[21:39.860 --> 21:41.260]  Oh, dude.
[21:41.260 --> 21:43.340]  It might be the least respectful.
[21:49.260 --> 21:53.060]  It's just said with such an abundance of love and affection, too.
[21:54.280 --> 21:55.540]  Dude, I am.
[21:56.040 --> 21:56.860]  That's so funny.
[21:56.940 --> 21:59.880]  Well, we've picked the nicknames, but it's not over because now,
[22:00.840 --> 22:06.760]  like we do, we must leave it up to the wheel as we go to the name, the name wheel.
[22:06.960 --> 22:08.820]  Who do you think's got the best, the best pool?
[22:08.960 --> 22:10.620]  Like, who's going to be happy either way?
[22:10.620 --> 22:12.060]  Nick. Yeah, I feel good.
[22:12.120 --> 22:13.540]  Nick, I'm pretty fucking happy.
[22:14.080 --> 22:16.740]  I think Nick is, I think Nick's is, Nick's are really strong.
[22:16.980 --> 22:17.760]  Nick is good.
[22:18.120 --> 22:19.500]  And we're going to start with Nick.
[22:20.140 --> 22:21.020]  Oh, sweet.
[22:21.180 --> 22:22.500]  Yeah, as we do this.
[22:24.240 --> 22:26.120]  Nick, you have the names.
[22:28.580 --> 22:29.060]  Schwartwaffe,
[22:31.180 --> 22:31.660]  Schwartwaffe,
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.140]  you have Showbiz,
[22:34.300 --> 22:35.860]  you have Boots
[22:36.920 --> 22:39.540]  and you have the mechanic.
[22:39.540 --> 22:45.640]  Nick, I'm going to shuffle because we shuffled six times to randomize the names.
[22:45.800 --> 22:48.900]  I'm going to shuffle six times before spinning the wheel.
[22:49.120 --> 22:52.300]  Fantastic. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[22:52.460 --> 22:55.740]  And now, Nick, for your 25, 2025 nickname.
[22:55.940 --> 22:57.200]  Here we go. So excited.
[22:57.720 --> 22:59.080]  The wheel spin, what's it going to be?
[22:59.140 --> 23:01.360]  Oh my God, I can't look. This is nuts.
[23:02.300 --> 23:04.280]  Nick is the mechanic!
[23:04.760 --> 23:08.700]  He got his number one.
[23:09.160 --> 23:11.680]  I'm so sad it's not Schwartwaffe.
[23:12.660 --> 23:14.860]  Well, maybe in 2026 it can be.
[23:14.980 --> 23:18.000]  But for 2025, we can only refer to him as Nick or the mechanic.
[23:18.340 --> 23:19.180]  Well, there you go.
[23:19.840 --> 23:21.620]  That is those are Nick's nicknames.
[23:21.920 --> 23:22.860]  That's what they are.
[23:22.920 --> 23:24.820]  And Nick is the mechanic.
[23:25.060 --> 23:29.620]  Andrew, we move on to you, as you've been dubbed Andy Pants.
[23:30.100 --> 23:31.080]  Anything but that.
[23:31.480 --> 23:32.000]  Gizmo.
[23:32.630 --> 23:33.580]  I'm OK with that.
[23:33.900 --> 23:35.280]  Killer. Don't mind it.
[23:35.720 --> 23:36.340]  Plumbum.
[23:36.960 --> 23:38.740]  Don't love that one as much.
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.220]  But here we go.
[23:40.340 --> 23:41.960]  I'm really only cheering against Andy Pants.
[23:42.380 --> 23:45.100]  Three, four, five, six.
[23:45.180 --> 23:46.940]  And the spins begin.
[23:48.200 --> 23:48.760]  No pants.
[23:49.340 --> 23:50.080]  You're going to put them on.
[23:50.640 --> 23:52.820]  Here we go. Big pants.
[23:52.960 --> 23:56.700]  Come on, Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo.
[23:56.840 --> 23:57.840]  It's Gizmo!
[24:03.120 --> 24:06.760]  For 2025, we'll be Gizmo!
[24:07.720 --> 24:08.940]  Congratulations, Gizmo.
[24:09.520 --> 24:10.360]  Of that one.
[24:10.500 --> 24:12.440]  There are two I really liked and...
[24:12.960 --> 24:14.040]  Way to go, Gizmo.
[24:15.100 --> 24:16.000]  I'm next.
[24:16.380 --> 24:19.320]  I have EZE, I have Rat E Boy.
[24:19.900 --> 24:22.200]  I have Lil Trump, which I will never claim.
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.120]  And I have Lil Ricky E.
[24:24.120 --> 24:25.920]  I believe if it lands on Lil Trump,
[24:26.020 --> 24:28.840]  you're just going to write an executive order that changes the rules.
[24:29.140 --> 24:31.520]  If you want to change it to Lil Twump,
[24:31.520 --> 24:34.480]  we can. Two, three, four, five, six.
[24:34.580 --> 24:35.420]  Here we go.
[24:36.520 --> 24:37.240]  Oh, boy.
[24:37.580 --> 24:38.540]  You know what I'm betting on?
[24:40.040 --> 24:40.540]  Uh oh.
[24:40.920 --> 24:42.440]  It's Lil Ricky B!
[24:44.140 --> 24:47.340]  Honestly, Lil Ricky B works for me.
[24:47.880 --> 24:51.600]  I am Lil Ricky B for all of 2025.
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.320]  Gavin, how are you feeling about me going by your nickname?
[24:55.640 --> 24:57.780]  I like it. I'm happy with it.
[24:58.360 --> 24:59.900]  Lil Ricky B.
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.540]  You've picked two of the nicknames so far, Gavin.
[25:01.540 --> 25:02.740]  Yeah, this is the way to go, man.
[25:03.200 --> 25:04.400]  Gavin nicknames us.
[25:04.960 --> 25:09.000]  And next we go with Geoff, who is Doggy G or G-Dog.
[25:10.220 --> 25:11.180]  Boss Dog.
[25:11.640 --> 25:12.000]  Absolutely.
[25:12.540 --> 25:13.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:13.520 --> 25:14.320]  Baby Pepsi.
[25:16.160 --> 25:17.120]  And Geezer.
[25:18.960 --> 25:19.940]  Randomized six times.
[25:20.060 --> 25:22.420]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[25:22.560 --> 25:24.700]  Geoff, are you ready to learn your 2025 nickname?
[25:25.080 --> 25:25.700]  Here we go.
[25:25.720 --> 25:27.240]  Fingers crossed for Baby Pepsi.
[25:27.240 --> 25:30.420]  Oh, my God.
[25:30.880 --> 25:31.500]  Oh, yeah.
[25:31.600 --> 25:32.080]  Come on, baby.
[25:32.360 --> 25:33.780]  Yes, yes, yes.
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.720]  And for 2025, Geoff will be known as Baby Pepsi.
[25:41.040 --> 25:41.520]  Wow.
[25:42.720 --> 25:45.100]  How are you feeling about Baby Pepsi, Baby Pepsi?
[25:45.340 --> 25:47.600]  I love it. It's the one I would have been happy with any of them.
[25:47.660 --> 25:49.020]  But that was my favorite. That was my choice.
[25:49.240 --> 25:49.480]  Awesome.
[25:49.940 --> 25:55.660]  Well, we finally go to Gavin and his nicknames, Jirgassi Goo, Free Bird.
[25:55.820 --> 25:56.720]  Really like that one.
[25:56.720 --> 25:58.300]  Really like a little spooky.
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.620]  And finally, the meanest name on the whole thing, Dance Friend.
[26:03.660 --> 26:04.980]  It's randomized six times.
[26:05.980 --> 26:08.900]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.240]  And we begin the spin.
[26:11.060 --> 26:11.720]  Here we go.
[26:12.220 --> 26:14.480]  God, if you exist, please give me Dance Friend.
[26:15.780 --> 26:21.740]  Oh, Gassi Goo for 2025.
[26:22.860 --> 26:25.980]  We have a winner and it's Gassi Goo.
[26:27.280 --> 26:29.600]  I think it's really funny that Gavin is
[26:29.600 --> 26:34.540]  getting called Gassi Goo for a year because he took a long shit before one recording.
[26:35.500 --> 26:37.200]  He's done it several times now.
[26:37.340 --> 26:39.100]  He's shot the recordings full of air.
[26:39.360 --> 26:39.880]  There you go.
[26:39.980 --> 26:41.620]  This is like the fifth or sixth time, to be fair.
[26:41.780 --> 26:44.900]  It is, but he came up with it while Gavin was shitting.
[26:45.220 --> 26:46.620]  So that's true, I did.
[26:47.160 --> 26:48.320]  Well, there you have it.
[26:48.700 --> 26:50.440]  The nicknames draft is complete.
[26:50.740 --> 26:51.840]  Let's go one by one.
[26:52.040 --> 26:55.680]  Let's talk and let's let's talk about it real quick and wrap this up.
[26:55.680 --> 26:58.740]  Nick, you will be the mechanic for 2025.
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.480]  How are you feeling? I feel great.
[27:00.620 --> 27:01.460]  Yeah, that's fantastic.
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.740]  Yeah, easy going. It makes you sound cool.
[27:03.860 --> 27:04.900]  I'm in. OK, let's do it.
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.480]  It's like someone that people would would get into a heist, maybe.
[27:09.240 --> 27:12.820]  If there's a list of people, we've got to bring them.
[27:13.380 --> 27:13.520]  Yep.
[27:14.300 --> 27:16.660]  Andrew, for 2025, you'll be known as Gizmo.
[27:17.080 --> 27:18.860]  How are you feeling about that? I like it.
[27:18.920 --> 27:20.900]  It's not something I've ever been called.
[27:21.020 --> 27:24.160]  It's probably going to take a while to get used to being called Gizmo.
[27:24.160 --> 27:27.740]  I think it'll be sort of like when you adopt a dog and try to change their name.
[27:27.940 --> 27:31.920]  Like you're maybe saying it to me and like I'm just not going to react initially.
[27:31.980 --> 27:34.040]  But we'll get there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[27:34.140 --> 27:35.280]  I feel good about it. I like Gizmo.
[27:35.700 --> 27:38.680]  I got Lil Ricky B, which honestly I'm good with.
[27:38.800 --> 27:40.520]  I live a Lil Ricky B. I like that.
[27:40.560 --> 27:43.900]  It's a longer name than my name, but I think it's fun.
[27:44.040 --> 27:45.620]  Everyone's like, oh shit, Lil Ricky B.
[27:45.920 --> 27:48.560]  I mean, you can shorten it to whichever combination you want.
[27:48.620 --> 27:50.660]  Just be Ricky or Lil B.
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.060]  Be like Lil B. Lil Rick!
[27:53.700 --> 27:54.420]  Lil Rick.
[27:55.780 --> 27:57.700]  I like it. People call me Ricky B.
[27:57.840 --> 28:00.780]  People call me B. I think I think it works all the way.
[28:01.220 --> 28:02.740]  Nicknames are living documents.
[28:02.940 --> 28:04.320]  Exactly. Yeah, exactly.
[28:05.620 --> 28:07.220]  And Geoff, you have baby Pepsi.
[28:07.340 --> 28:08.180]  How are you feeling about it? I did.
[28:08.300 --> 28:09.920]  I feel so fucking good about baby Pepsi.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.180]  I want a T-shirt that says it.
[28:12.260 --> 28:16.400]  Dude, oh, should we do one of those T-shirts that's like the name, the name,
[28:16.440 --> 28:19.100]  the name, the name, like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:19.240 --> 28:20.500]  Hey, let me practice real fast.
[28:20.540 --> 28:21.600]  Let me see what it sounds like,
[28:21.600 --> 28:24.320]  because I won't be able to do this until after in the podcast,
[28:24.420 --> 28:26.060]  until after this episode comes out. Right.
[28:26.120 --> 28:27.360]  Because we don't want to spoil our nicknames, right?
[28:27.560 --> 28:31.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[28:31.600 --> 28:34.080]  My name is... fuck, I already forgot my name.
[28:34.660 --> 28:37.200]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[28:37.460 --> 28:38.560]  My name is baby Pepsi.
[28:38.740 --> 28:43.560]  And with me, as always, Lil Ricky B, the mechanic, gizmo and gassy goo.
[28:43.880 --> 28:44.840]  How's it going today, boys?
[28:45.300 --> 28:46.460]  Dude, that's pretty good.
[28:46.820 --> 28:47.600]  That's pretty good.
[28:47.600 --> 28:49.440]  That sounds like the beginning of a good podcast.
[28:49.560 --> 28:51.080]  Well, it sounds like the beginning of a podcast
[28:51.080 --> 28:55.460]  I wouldn't personally like listen to if somebody said this is gassy goo.
[28:56.240 --> 28:59.260]  But, you know, how are you feeling about that nickname, gassy goo?
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.560]  Let me look at the other ones. Yeah, I think it's I think it's perfect.
[29:02.760 --> 29:05.540]  I'm obviously very glad that it wasn't the last one.
[29:05.920 --> 29:07.300]  A little spooky would have been interesting.
[29:07.480 --> 29:10.080]  I think I would have struggled to explain why when people asked.
[29:11.800 --> 29:12.660]  I'm happy with it.
[29:13.380 --> 29:17.840]  So if it had gone as bad as possible, it would have been like this.
[29:17.840 --> 29:21.080]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[29:21.580 --> 29:22.560]  My name is Geezer.
[29:22.740 --> 29:29.380]  And with me, as always, Schwartwave, the Herman Plumbum, Lil Trump and Dan's friend.
[29:29.560 --> 29:32.520]  Dude, I guess Andrew didn't want Andy Pants.
[29:33.220 --> 29:35.120]  Yeah, that's that's tough.
[29:35.320 --> 29:38.860]  But my thinking behind the nicknames was
[29:39.980 --> 29:43.760]  I tried to lean into some stuff where people go like, why is your nickname that?
[29:43.980 --> 29:45.100]  And then you have to go.
[29:45.100 --> 29:47.780]  So we had to do like a draft.
[29:47.840 --> 29:51.500]  I don't really know why my nickname is Showbiz.
[29:52.040 --> 29:57.540]  A little spooky, but Gassy Goo, way to go.
[29:57.680 --> 29:58.520]  That's good, guys.
[29:59.020 --> 29:59.880]  The nickname draft.
[30:00.080 --> 30:02.620]  Let us know which nicknames are the strongest.
[30:02.920 --> 30:06.860]  Let us know what nicknames you would have picked and let us know what your nicknames
[30:06.860 --> 30:09.860]  are. Thank you for checking this out.
