[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Who wants to lead this one?
[00:01.340 --> 00:03.640]  I don't remember. I feel like this was a Geoff one, but I don't remember.
[00:03.920 --> 00:05.520]  I think I can lead it.
[00:05.560 --> 00:06.020]  Hold on.
[00:06.060 --> 00:06.180]  OK.
[00:06.820 --> 00:09.940]  Hello and welcome to another regulation draft.
[00:10.040 --> 00:11.260]  This one's a Gavin idea.
[00:11.400 --> 00:13.080]  Gavin, why don't you go ahead and tell us about it?
[00:13.560 --> 00:14.200]  Oh, classic.
[00:14.880 --> 00:15.800]  This is pretty good.
[00:16.800 --> 00:18.160]  I mean, this was my idea.
[00:18.320 --> 00:19.320]  Do you want it to be your idea?
[00:19.420 --> 00:19.660]  It was?
[00:19.780 --> 00:21.160]  Well, then why didn't you say anything?
[00:21.460 --> 00:23.840]  No, I just fucking introduced you to Gavin.
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.060]  Oh, my God.
[00:25.220 --> 00:27.540]  Well, just right before Eric said this is a Geoff idea.
[00:27.620 --> 00:28.340]  So I was like, OK.
[00:28.340 --> 00:30.420]  I said, I think this is a Geoff idea.
[00:30.620 --> 00:32.160]  And then you didn't say shit.
[00:32.300 --> 00:34.080]  And I said, I got it.
[00:34.240 --> 00:35.080]  I'll intro.
[00:35.420 --> 00:37.180]  And then I introed her to the correct person.
[00:37.500 --> 00:39.600]  You, are you feeling OK today?
[00:40.520 --> 00:42.520]  So some people in here are peeved.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.180]  This is the peeves draft.
[00:45.420 --> 00:47.640]  I think I just developed a new pet peeve.
[00:47.720 --> 00:49.320]  Yeah, I wrote a new one down.
[00:49.560 --> 00:50.680]  I mean, we've done this before.
[00:51.340 --> 00:53.660]  This is literally I feel like this happened last week.
[00:53.940 --> 00:55.040]  This exact same thing.
[00:55.240 --> 00:57.500]  Yeah, I just don't know why Gavin didn't say, oh, this was mine.
[00:57.500 --> 00:59.220]  You guys know that drafts are five players?
[00:59.440 --> 01:00.320]  Didn't last week either.
[01:02.680 --> 01:03.620]  Since when, Nick?
[01:06.040 --> 01:07.500]  This is the peeves draft.
[01:07.700 --> 01:11.000]  We do it on the regulation draft generator brought to you,
[01:11.100 --> 01:13.800]  I believe, by Sean Bear on Auction House.
[01:14.440 --> 01:16.980]  This is a randomized draft, just like always.
[01:17.100 --> 01:20.400]  So how many times are we going to randomize the names to figure out
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.340]  who is going first and who is going last in this draft?
[01:23.940 --> 01:25.220]  Well, it's 2025.
[01:25.820 --> 01:27.920]  So maybe we should do it 2025 times.
[01:28.540 --> 01:31.440]  OK, or what's is anyone have a second idea?
[01:32.480 --> 01:33.360]  Twenty five.
[01:33.700 --> 01:36.380]  OK, I like that idea about 2000 times more.
[01:36.640 --> 01:38.640]  So twenty five works for me.
[01:38.720 --> 01:39.180]  You guys ready?
[01:39.580 --> 01:40.820]  I'm ready. Snake draft.
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.940]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:43.600 --> 01:45.100]  Gavin, Nick, Eric, Geoff, Andrew.
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.400]  11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16.
[01:51.440 --> 01:54.520]  21 is Eric, Gavin, Geoff, Nick, Andrew.
[01:55.040 --> 01:56.500]  22, 23, 24.
[01:57.180 --> 01:58.660]  Eric, Andrew, Geoff, Gavin, Nick.
[01:58.760 --> 02:00.500]  Oh, no, I don't want to be first.
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.260]  Here we go.
[02:02.240 --> 02:03.020]  Twenty five.
[02:03.120 --> 02:05.960]  Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Geoff.
[02:06.340 --> 02:07.720]  Oh, middle. I like the middle.
[02:08.500 --> 02:10.600]  Interesting. Very interesting.
[02:11.140 --> 02:13.540]  G's on the ends. G bookends.
[02:14.100 --> 02:15.860]  Yeah. The end cap, G caps.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.160]  It's a bookend.
[02:18.680 --> 02:19.540]  Oh, man.
[02:19.760 --> 02:23.920]  Gavin, since this is your draft, you can you can lead us off first with your.
[02:23.920 --> 02:25.080]  He's leading the peeves.
[02:25.560 --> 02:26.960]  Peeve. Peeve!
[02:27.260 --> 02:28.740]  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm going to start off.
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.400]  I didn't really know how peeved to be about some of these.
[02:31.500 --> 02:32.840]  Some of them I'm lightly peeved.
[02:33.280 --> 02:34.580]  And there's some major peeves.
[02:34.660 --> 02:35.840]  So I'm going to start with a lighter one.
[02:36.060 --> 02:39.560]  Why would you pick only slightly peeved pet peeves in your pet peeve draft?
[02:39.860 --> 02:41.540]  Wouldn't you want the maximum peeve?
[02:41.840 --> 02:43.980]  No, pet peeves are slight peeves, typically.
[02:44.680 --> 02:46.440]  I might not know what a pet peeve is.
[02:46.700 --> 02:47.300]  This is going to be fun.
[02:47.460 --> 02:50.040]  I think I once again just discovered a new one.
[02:51.340 --> 02:54.660]  Ah, what what did you think?
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.460]  What mild annoyance to maximum aggravation for the person
[02:59.460 --> 03:00.880]  is how I interpret a pet peeve.
[03:00.980 --> 03:03.000]  So you got to you got to pick like famines or something.
[03:03.540 --> 03:06.420]  No, I'm that's a severe problem.
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.760]  My number one pet peeve is famine.
[03:08.940 --> 03:10.920]  Famine. My number two is pestilence.
[03:11.160 --> 03:15.320]  I'm going to add what a pet peeve should be a minor annoyance
[03:15.320 --> 03:18.460]  or inconvenience that causes an outsized reaction in you.
[03:18.460 --> 03:19.560]  Yes, exactly.
[03:19.880 --> 03:21.680]  I'm adding pedantic to my list.
[03:21.920 --> 03:25.500]  So the concept of having a mild pet peeve is just I don't get it.
[03:25.560 --> 03:28.880]  But well, I've just got one like turbo peeve and the rest of pet peeves.
[03:28.900 --> 03:30.320]  So this is my first pet peeve.
[03:31.180 --> 03:32.580]  What's a turbo peeve?
[03:33.220 --> 03:35.000]  Outside of what your uncle was.
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.420]  That's that is such a that's just such a for us joke.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.820]  That rocks.
[03:48.840 --> 03:50.540]  That's the joke of the year.
[03:50.580 --> 03:52.140]  Who cares, dude?
[03:53.700 --> 03:54.820]  Oh, man.
[03:55.140 --> 03:56.340]  Oh, that is fantastic.
[03:56.840 --> 03:57.940]  God, that's great.
[03:58.420 --> 04:01.400]  I'm going to start with full email and password
[04:01.400 --> 04:05.920]  sign in with two factor authentication using a TV remote.
[04:07.320 --> 04:10.240]  I don't know why I've never signed into Max.
[04:10.480 --> 04:12.180]  I'm constantly signed out of Hulu.
[04:12.480 --> 04:14.120]  What do you want from me?
[04:14.120 --> 04:16.500]  Give me a QR code, you idiot.
[04:16.680 --> 04:18.480]  Yeah, I think that's pretty good.
[04:18.540 --> 04:19.440]  I love that.
[04:19.520 --> 04:21.240]  I think a lot of them are doing QR code.
[04:21.360 --> 04:23.240]  But yeah, I didn't even think about it.
[04:23.320 --> 04:24.520]  I think that's such a good one.
[04:24.600 --> 04:25.640]  Email, password sign in with two.
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.780]  Yeah, no, it's annoying for sure.
[04:27.840 --> 04:29.340]  Yeah. And then I got to go and like get a phone.
[04:30.040 --> 04:33.900]  Well, it's the worst when you want to just watch something.
[04:33.980 --> 04:38.060]  You are settled into like the couch and then you go and you have been signed out
[04:38.060 --> 04:40.800]  of that thing and then you have to sign in.
[04:40.820 --> 04:43.560]  But you the password you think you've put in right.
[04:43.560 --> 04:46.200]  And so you have now you have to reset the password because it's wrong.
[04:46.300 --> 04:49.540]  And it's now you have like all these extra steps to watch
[04:49.540 --> 04:53.560]  the dumbest TV in the world like that is brutal.
[04:53.860 --> 04:55.480]  I feel like an additional layer.
[04:55.660 --> 05:00.480]  When I set up Amazon Prime on my box,
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.480]  I feel like it did both, which was maximum aggravation
[05:04.480 --> 05:09.060]  where it made me sign into the account via the remote, did all that stuff.
[05:09.060 --> 05:11.700]  And then it says, hey, you got to sync this to your account.
[05:11.700 --> 05:13.260]  Use your phone to sign in.
[05:13.520 --> 05:16.280]  I can't just let me let me do both.
[05:16.800 --> 05:19.060]  Just let me do one. I just need one.
[05:19.460 --> 05:21.040]  I forget paying more for ads.
[05:21.180 --> 05:24.220]  I want to pay a dollar more just to never be signed out.
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.240]  Yeah, don't touch me. Don't look at me.
[05:26.340 --> 05:28.300]  You would pay a premium for less security.
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.100]  Yeah, yeah, pretty good. Yeah.
[05:30.380 --> 05:32.580]  Well, so we're going to watch my shows.
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.200]  I mean, it would be you say that jokingly, that would become a pet peeve.
[05:39.220 --> 05:39.620]  Pretty quick.
[05:39.620 --> 05:42.360]  I feel like if all the shows you're trying to watch, they just finish them.
[05:42.740 --> 05:44.220]  You never know where you left off.
[05:44.460 --> 05:46.680]  It doesn't delete them when they finish them, though.
[05:46.980 --> 05:48.400]  No, but it fills the bar fills.
[05:48.540 --> 05:49.120]  Yeah, it does.
[05:49.380 --> 05:51.700]  You know, like I'm always trying to figure out what episode of Southern
[05:51.700 --> 05:52.840]  Charm I'm on right now.
[05:53.220 --> 05:55.340]  It's because Emily go to sleep during them.
[05:55.580 --> 06:00.340]  Well, that's a great out the gate pick for your peeve, Gavin and Nick.
[06:00.400 --> 06:01.540]  You have the next one.
[06:01.800 --> 06:06.660]  Gentlemen, I am going with Supreme pizzas at parties.
[06:07.860 --> 06:09.440]  Well, follow me on this.
[06:09.940 --> 06:12.080]  Inevitably, I'm not following you anywhere on this.
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.440]  You lunatic. No, no, no.
[06:13.440 --> 06:14.220]  Listen, listen, listen.
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.500]  I like a spring pizza, too.
[06:15.540 --> 06:17.200]  But here's the problem with Supreme pizza, right?
[06:17.580 --> 06:23.680]  As a result, the person does not often get an equatable amount of pepperoni
[06:23.680 --> 06:26.840]  or cheese or whatever else meat lovers to that. Right.
[06:26.880 --> 06:28.900]  So there's like two of each of those pizzas. Right.
[06:28.920 --> 06:33.420]  And inevitably, at least 60 percent of the party goers
[06:33.420 --> 06:35.640]  do not like something on a Supreme pizza,
[06:35.800 --> 06:37.900]  whether it be onion or bell pepper or whatever.
[06:38.040 --> 06:42.140]  And as a result, they all hoard the pepperoni.
[06:42.400 --> 06:43.480]  I see what you're saying.
[06:43.720 --> 06:44.500]  The meat lovers.
[06:44.660 --> 06:48.800]  And it's left to us who actually tolerate the OK Supreme pizza
[06:48.800 --> 06:49.760]  to have those slices.
[06:49.980 --> 06:51.380]  And then we're out of the stuff.
[06:51.440 --> 06:55.760]  We truly want the meat lovers, the pepperoni, the cheese.
[06:55.960 --> 07:00.140]  And we have to sit there and watch as these people who don't like those things
[07:00.140 --> 07:02.480]  get to enjoy the pizza you actually want.
[07:03.180 --> 07:04.620]  And that is my pet peeve.
[07:04.700 --> 07:06.740]  This you're getting 100.
[07:06.920 --> 07:10.600]  This is 100 percent eat Nick coming out in this show right now.
[07:10.660 --> 07:12.560]  This is like these are like strong.
[07:12.660 --> 07:15.280]  This is great because that's such a strong food opinion for something
[07:15.280 --> 07:18.980]  I've never really thought about ever in my life.
[07:19.100 --> 07:23.280]  Absolutely. Have you guys ever seen that podcast of like the four
[07:23.280 --> 07:25.880]  12 year old kids? Yes. You food.
[07:26.040 --> 07:28.100]  Yes. Yeah. Nick is those kids.
[07:28.360 --> 07:30.260]  Let's go. Nick's the kid going.
[07:30.360 --> 07:32.200]  I've never had a carrot and you can't make me try one.
[07:32.480 --> 07:35.900]  That's true. I love carrots. Oh, what a picnic.
[07:36.520 --> 07:37.800]  Picnic. Oh, Nick.
[07:38.060 --> 07:40.480]  Writing that down for nicknames next year.
[07:41.240 --> 07:44.060]  Only supreme pizzas at my parties from here on out.
[07:44.560 --> 07:46.100]  That's fine, because I still get pizza.
[07:46.340 --> 07:48.900]  Dude, if you don't like all the ingredients on a supreme pizza,
[07:48.960 --> 07:51.360]  you need to get right with God, because they're all delicious.
[07:51.660 --> 07:54.460]  I agree. However, sometimes I just want a pepperoni piece.
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.600]  Just saying. And they're all gone.
[07:56.900 --> 07:58.160]  You and all the 12 year olds.
[07:58.540 --> 07:59.760]  What'd you have for lunch yesterday, Nick?
[08:00.260 --> 08:01.860]  The leftover supreme pizza. OK.
[08:05.500 --> 08:06.720]  But I also had mushrooms.
[08:07.160 --> 08:08.780]  Did you write this one down right after that, Nick?
[08:10.260 --> 08:12.320]  No, it wasn't a party. I wasn't mad. OK.
[08:13.400 --> 08:16.700]  So look at they cursed me with all these delicious ingredients.
[08:16.760 --> 08:19.880]  Now I have to suffer through all these amazing flavors.
[08:20.180 --> 08:22.720]  That's sometimes I want a meat lovers.
[08:23.140 --> 08:26.040]  I feel like from everything you described, I would go straight for the supreme.
[08:26.520 --> 08:27.420]  Yeah, I'd start with it.
[08:27.420 --> 08:30.540]  Yeah. But then you want just the pepperoni.
[08:30.860 --> 08:32.820]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.120]  OK, I think Nick's pet peeve just might be not ordering enough pizzas.
[08:36.480 --> 08:38.080]  Yes, that is absolutely what it is.
[08:38.220 --> 08:40.440]  No, because there's always leftover supreme pizza.
[08:40.520 --> 08:42.120]  And there's no leftover pizza.
[08:42.420 --> 08:44.740]  There's a there's a there's an undercurrent here.
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.280]  What Nick isn't expressly saying, but what he's conveying
[08:48.280 --> 08:51.560]  is that his real problem is with the vegetables on the pizza
[08:51.560 --> 08:53.840]  because he wants more cheese. He wants more pepperoni.
[08:53.880 --> 08:54.840]  He wants more meat lovers.
[08:54.840 --> 08:57.700]  The all those things are on the supreme pizza.
[08:57.800 --> 09:00.340]  The only thing that's on the supreme pizza that he's not mentioning
[09:00.340 --> 09:03.020]  are all the green things that are actually good for you.
[09:03.060 --> 09:04.120]  Fuck, I want a pizza now.
[09:04.300 --> 09:05.700]  Yeah, the good for you pizza.
[09:05.860 --> 09:08.220]  Shit. The good for you pizza.
[09:10.980 --> 09:14.200]  Andrew, we have we have pizza opinions going on here.
[09:14.200 --> 09:15.860]  But what's your what's your peeve?
[09:16.160 --> 09:18.780]  Oh, my peeve. This one really grinds my gears.
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.380]  Oh, boy. Boy, I'm getting heated just thinking about it.
[09:23.380 --> 09:26.220]  My first pet peeve in the first round
[09:26.220 --> 09:30.120]  is when people expect you to do a tail sink in a video
[09:30.120 --> 09:31.900]  that's less than 10 minutes long.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.220]  Oh, my God. How can I continue?
[09:35.640 --> 09:38.640]  Jesus Christ. It's so infuriating.
[09:39.120 --> 09:43.100]  I mean, I'm supposed to do that just because they're concerned
[09:43.100 --> 09:44.700]  about the security of the recording.
[09:45.100 --> 09:46.580]  No, that's ridiculous.
[09:47.100 --> 09:48.860]  Nothing can go wrong in under 10 minutes.
[09:48.980 --> 09:51.400]  I refuse to do it. I'll never do it.
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.680]  It's outrageous.
[09:53.020 --> 09:54.780]  Oh, I'm just so mad about it.
[09:55.480 --> 09:58.080]  OK, I'm just going to quickly add in a new peeve here.
[09:59.980 --> 10:01.180]  Oh, it's infuriating.
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.520]  Might be a little inside baseball for people.
[10:04.620 --> 10:07.960]  I know that's kind of specific to my life, but oh, man.
[10:08.200 --> 10:12.000]  Oh, I can't stand when people expect me to do a tail sink.
[10:13.460 --> 10:15.720]  Oh, God. Countdown from five.
[10:15.820 --> 10:16.660]  Fuck you.
[10:17.160 --> 10:20.400]  I will, you know, I might have to counter this in my next peeve.
[10:20.400 --> 10:24.100]  Well, we'll be able to get around there because it is a snake draft,
[10:24.220 --> 10:28.260]  but you're going to have to wait for your peeve to counter Andrew.
[10:28.420 --> 10:30.700]  And I'm so curious about what his second is going to be.
[10:31.040 --> 10:32.680]  Yeah, I'll go next.
[10:33.180 --> 10:34.860]  Mine's a pretty simple one.
[10:35.820 --> 10:36.540]  Unexpected updates.
[10:37.220 --> 10:40.840]  When you are sitting down and oh, dude, I'm fine.
[10:40.880 --> 10:42.480]  I'm a place of call of duty. Oh, never mind.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.260]  Oh, cool. I'm going to I'm going to watch.
[10:45.380 --> 10:47.160]  I'm going to watch something on Max. Oh, never mind.
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.320]  Oh, cool. All right.
[10:48.320 --> 10:49.980]  Well, just got to get some work done on this computer.
[10:49.980 --> 10:53.200]  Oh, Windows needs to reboot because of the update that just occurred.
[10:53.280 --> 10:54.620]  And there's no way for me to stop it.
[10:54.900 --> 11:00.700]  OK. Unexpected updates are a thing that I'm sure are helping me
[11:00.700 --> 11:05.460]  in some way, shape or form, but I only see the negative in them
[11:05.460 --> 11:08.560]  and hardly ever the positive. I hate it.
[11:08.740 --> 11:13.140]  The worst part about it is that most things have an option to like,
[11:13.260 --> 11:15.380]  oh, do you want to auto update at like 3 a.m.?
[11:15.380 --> 11:18.260]  Yep. I'm constantly waking up to messages that are like,
[11:18.260 --> 11:19.580]  oh, we couldn't install the update.
[11:19.820 --> 11:20.880]  Couldn't do it. Sorry. Yeah.
[11:21.120 --> 11:22.100]  What's the point?
[11:22.380 --> 11:24.820]  Yep. Just do it when I'm not using it, you idiot.
[11:25.240 --> 11:27.680]  Yeah. Yep. Hey, this isn't your peeve.
[11:27.980 --> 11:29.780]  Sorry. I'm peeved by that. It's a great pick.
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.780]  No, that's good. It's good to know that it's a universal thing.
[11:32.900 --> 11:35.860]  Like, I just I hate it so much.
[11:35.980 --> 11:40.380]  Like, oh, having to download something when you're ready to do that thing
[11:40.380 --> 11:43.840]  is just like, all right, I'll just it feels like being a kid again.
[11:44.180 --> 11:47.540]  In a way where you're just like, well, I'll sit helplessly
[11:47.540 --> 11:49.840]  for a while and wait.
[11:50.180 --> 11:53.480]  Not like in a you still believe magic is real, but more like
[11:53.480 --> 11:54.980]  you don't have control over your time.
[11:55.340 --> 11:58.820]  Well, at that time, that's when I go on r slash black magic fuckery
[11:58.820 --> 12:00.340]  to see if magic is real.
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.080]  So I have some time to check it out.
[12:02.420 --> 12:03.360]  But that's my peeve.
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.660]  And Geoff, you have two peeves in a row because you're the end of the snake
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.320]  and you got to earn a rose to this thing.
[12:09.400 --> 12:12.640]  First off, sat down to I thought, do I even have pet peeves?
[12:12.660 --> 12:15.940]  I started with the collab one and I thought, well, I won't even use that
[12:15.940 --> 12:17.160]  because that's been covered in content.
[12:17.160 --> 12:20.220]  And then I realized very quickly that I have a number of pet peeves
[12:20.220 --> 12:22.800]  and I'm afraid that one draft isn't going to do it.
[12:22.940 --> 12:27.000]  I would actually like to expressly request at the end of the draft.
[12:27.280 --> 12:31.740]  We don't list our like our all because I think we should all save them
[12:31.740 --> 12:35.280]  for a future pet peeve job, because I think I could personally field
[12:35.280 --> 12:36.740]  three or four or six or eight.
[12:36.980 --> 12:40.620]  OK, and so initially you sat down and went, do I have any of these?
[12:40.640 --> 12:43.820]  Yeah, yeah. And then I thought I hate everything and everyone.
[12:44.360 --> 12:45.680]  God, I don't even know where to start.
[12:45.680 --> 12:47.940]  I'm going to pick a specific one because it annoyed me recently.
[12:48.620 --> 12:50.380]  So this would be my first peeve.
[12:50.780 --> 12:56.020]  This is when you when you book a hotel room via an app or the Internet
[12:56.020 --> 12:58.740]  and they say, would you like virtual check in?
[12:58.860 --> 13:01.200]  And you go, yeah, because I don't like to talk to people.
[13:01.440 --> 13:05.380]  And I find the process of checking the process of checking into a hotel
[13:05.380 --> 13:09.880]  in itself is a pet peeve because of the 75 hours of typing
[13:09.880 --> 13:13.240]  that they have to do to put in or in your last name. Right.
[13:13.880 --> 13:15.100]  And run your credit card.
[13:15.100 --> 13:18.840]  So when they say, would you like to would you like to check in virtually
[13:18.840 --> 13:21.280]  via the app or the Hilton app or the Marriott app?
[13:21.300 --> 13:24.460]  I go, oh, my God, that's a fucking godsend to go through the process.
[13:24.460 --> 13:26.020]  And it's like, do you want a virtual key?
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.920]  And you go, yes. And one of two things happens.
[13:27.920 --> 13:31.060]  It goes, oh, sorry, virtual keys aren't available for this location.
[13:31.180 --> 13:33.400]  Or it goes, oh, there was an unexplained error.
[13:33.660 --> 13:36.420]  Just check in at the get at the front desk and they'll give you your key.
[13:36.720 --> 13:38.720]  Or they'll say, yeah, the key is not available.
[13:38.880 --> 13:40.500]  Virtual key is not available for this hotel.
[13:40.500 --> 13:41.900]  So check in the front desk and they'll give you a key.
[13:42.140 --> 13:43.840]  So then you go to the front desk when you get there and you go, yeah,
[13:43.840 --> 13:45.960]  I just need to pick up my key and they go, are you checking in?
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.440]  And I go, no, I checked in on the app and they go, what's your last name, sir?
[13:48.780 --> 13:50.500]  You go, Ramsey. And they go, can I see your ID?
[13:50.580 --> 13:52.080]  And you're like, oh, my God.
[13:52.200 --> 13:54.120]  And then you give them your ID and then they go, sir,
[13:54.140 --> 13:55.220]  we need to have a credit card on file.
[13:55.260 --> 13:56.720]  And you go, don't you?
[13:56.760 --> 13:58.260]  And they go, but we need to run one physically.
[13:58.300 --> 13:59.560]  And I go, OK. And then you give them.
[13:59.560 --> 14:02.940]  And then the next thing you know, you're still checking into the fucking hotel.
[14:03.560 --> 14:05.980]  So why did you collect my information via app?
[14:06.200 --> 14:08.080]  Why did you waste my time via app?
[14:08.280 --> 14:11.140]  Why did I have to enter my credit card information via the fucking app?
[14:11.340 --> 14:12.540]  You didn't do shit for me.
[14:12.540 --> 14:15.040]  You just made me double the amount of work
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.240]  I got to do to stay in your hotel.
[14:19.400 --> 14:20.860]  That's my first pet peeve.
[14:20.920 --> 14:22.840]  That's a strong pet peeve. That's a good one.
[14:23.120 --> 14:25.060]  That's a strong one. That's a real good one.
[14:25.120 --> 14:29.200]  Yeah. And again, you sat down and went, I don't know if I have any of these.
[14:31.740 --> 14:32.940]  Wow. Oh, wow.
[14:32.940 --> 14:33.940]  It goes right back to you.
[14:34.380 --> 14:35.320]  Yeah, number two. Yeah.
[14:35.360 --> 14:35.960]  Let me take a second.
[14:36.140 --> 14:37.420]  Yeah, no, you got to gather.
[14:37.540 --> 14:39.300]  That was a lot. Catch your breath, buddy. Catch your breath.
[14:40.200 --> 14:42.420]  I don't like it when I'm in public.
[14:42.420 --> 14:47.540]  In a store, at a grocery store, in a mall, in any place in public
[14:47.540 --> 14:52.800]  where there are other people who also are navigating these same lanes and spaces
[14:52.800 --> 14:56.460]  and they are completely and totally oblivious
[14:56.460 --> 14:59.780]  and unaware to every other human,
[15:01.960 --> 15:05.340]  every other human being, every breathing mouth,
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.800]  every beating heart around them doesn't exist.
[15:07.940 --> 15:11.640]  And they amble through the dead middle of everywhere they go,
[15:11.640 --> 15:14.960]  either with a cart or with eighteen hundred fucking bags.
[15:15.340 --> 15:17.860]  And they're walking, they're walking.
[15:17.980 --> 15:20.480]  Honestly, they're walking like they're walking to their death.
[15:20.500 --> 15:23.280]  And they're like, I got to make this take as much time as humanly possible,
[15:23.280 --> 15:25.920]  because when I get to point B, they're going to hang me.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.400]  So I got to walk as slowly and maybe I'll walk a little to the right
[15:29.400 --> 15:32.220]  and then I'll look a little to the left and then I'll walk a little to the right
[15:32.220 --> 15:36.900]  again, and I will never at any point look behind me even slightly to find out
[15:36.900 --> 15:41.960]  that there is a traffic jam of 87 people that just want to buy cereal.
[15:42.560 --> 15:44.620]  So that's my other pet peeve.
[15:44.640 --> 15:47.300]  Oh, well said. Oh, man, Geoff.
[15:47.440 --> 15:49.360]  Yeah, that is infuriating.
[15:49.540 --> 15:50.900]  I've seen that happen to Eric.
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.540]  It happens all the the obliviousness of people in the world.
[15:56.720 --> 16:02.220]  Costco is so the place for that, where it is like, wow, man,
[16:02.220 --> 16:04.940]  this parking lot is like, what a mess. This is crazy.
[16:04.940 --> 16:08.120]  And then you get inside and you go, all the people who didn't know how to drive
[16:08.120 --> 16:09.520]  also don't know how to walk.
[16:09.800 --> 16:12.560]  I'm like, how did this happen?
[16:12.640 --> 16:14.880]  It is the word. I'm so with you on that one, Geoff.
[16:14.980 --> 16:16.500]  It big style. I hate it.
[16:16.980 --> 16:18.460]  My next one is easy.
[16:18.520 --> 16:21.660]  And this is a big pet peeve for me personally.
[16:21.660 --> 16:23.880]  And it is so ingrained in me.
[16:23.960 --> 16:26.700]  And I think we've talked about this, Geoff, but being late.
[16:28.980 --> 16:30.720]  I despise it.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.200]  I hate being late.
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.240]  Yeah, I am early as often as I can be.
[16:38.460 --> 16:42.040]  I hate being late to stuff.
[16:42.140 --> 16:43.320]  It's just it's miserable.
[16:43.620 --> 16:45.140]  It fucks everything up.
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.480]  I feel like there's like an expectation that you're like letting people down
[16:48.480 --> 16:51.060]  by being late to something as like a group thing.
[16:51.420 --> 16:53.420]  I don't I just let me just be on time.
[16:53.520 --> 16:56.300]  The only thing that I will be late for is parties,
[16:56.300 --> 17:01.200]  because that's not the same thing as being going to like a restaurant
[17:01.200 --> 17:03.880]  reservation or something like going to a house party.
[17:03.880 --> 17:04.660]  Totally different.
[17:05.080 --> 17:09.380]  So being late is myself, myself being late and others being late.
[17:09.480 --> 17:10.240]  I don't like late.
[17:10.660 --> 17:11.840]  Couldn't couldn't agree with you more.
[17:11.920 --> 17:15.120]  When I when I joined the army at 17, one of the first things they taught you
[17:15.120 --> 17:17.780]  is that if you aren't 15 minutes early, you're late.
[17:17.900 --> 17:20.000]  Oh, yeah. And they really drill that into you.
[17:20.220 --> 17:21.840]  Yeah, that has definitely stuck with me.
[17:21.900 --> 17:23.660]  I've just always been that guy.
[17:24.200 --> 17:25.140]  Pleasantries are great.
[17:25.420 --> 17:26.560]  Love a little pleasantries.
[17:26.760 --> 17:28.420]  Be early. Be early.
[17:28.740 --> 17:29.740]  You're ready to go.
[17:29.920 --> 17:33.220]  You don't want the stress of like, oh, I got to get everything together
[17:33.220 --> 17:34.840]  at the last minute. It's terrible.
[17:35.340 --> 17:37.260]  Absolutely. You're avoiding a rush.
[17:37.400 --> 17:40.480]  It's blowing through a door going, it's exactly nine a.m.
[17:40.520 --> 17:41.480]  while you're putting a tie on.
[17:44.100 --> 17:46.860]  It's exactly that's how I blow through a door going.
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.500]  It's exactly nine a.m.
[17:48.820 --> 17:49.460]  I'm still on time.
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.960]  That's my second peeve.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.460]  Andrew, what's your second peeve?
[17:54.820 --> 17:56.560]  My second peeve. Oh, boy.
[17:56.780 --> 17:59.100]  Oh, yeah. Give me a minute.
[17:59.380 --> 18:01.200]  Got it myself. He's fired up.
[18:01.440 --> 18:02.860]  Oh, a little bad about it.
[18:02.860 --> 18:03.860]  It's been in content.
[18:04.060 --> 18:06.240]  We've discussed it before, but it is.
[18:06.640 --> 18:09.540]  Oh, oh, really gets the gears grinding.
[18:09.800 --> 18:11.220]  The rust is flying off.
[18:11.720 --> 18:13.820]  I hate the word collab.
[18:14.340 --> 18:16.240]  Use the full word.
[18:16.780 --> 18:18.480]  Collaborate. Easy to do.
[18:18.700 --> 18:21.620]  Only a few extra letters, you lazy assholes.
[18:22.100 --> 18:23.740]  Collab. Who says that?
[18:24.020 --> 18:26.500]  Just a bunch of idiots who says that.
[18:26.720 --> 18:28.100]  Bet you they don't know how to walk either.
[18:28.100 --> 18:32.900]  Or also enjoy using phone, email, password, signing in with two factor
[18:32.900 --> 18:34.840]  authentication on a TV remote.
[18:35.040 --> 18:36.180]  Bunch of fools.
[18:36.460 --> 18:37.580]  Fools, I tell you.
[18:38.280 --> 18:38.720]  Collab.
[18:39.900 --> 18:40.700]  It's pretty good.
[18:40.960 --> 18:41.980]  That's a good one. I agree.
[18:42.220 --> 18:43.280]  Yeah, definitely agree.
[18:43.520 --> 18:44.100]  It's pretty strong.
[18:44.480 --> 18:46.140]  I'm just glad I'm not the only one.
[18:46.220 --> 18:47.660]  Yeah, I agree.
[18:47.880 --> 18:48.340]  Oh, man.
[18:48.840 --> 18:50.440]  This is. Oh, God.
[18:50.460 --> 18:53.100]  I'm so curious to see where the rest of Andrew's pet peeves go.
[18:53.200 --> 18:53.980]  This is very.
[18:54.620 --> 18:56.980]  I, you know, I dug deep into my soul to find these.
[18:56.980 --> 18:58.540]  This is I really excavated.
[18:58.620 --> 18:59.880]  Yeah, yeah. No, yeah, absolutely.
[19:00.040 --> 19:00.640]  Dude. Oh, yeah.
[19:00.720 --> 19:02.180]  Yeah. He's got two of four so far.
[19:02.420 --> 19:03.520]  You were halfway there for you, bud.
[19:03.860 --> 19:05.160]  But next, it's Nick.
[19:05.180 --> 19:06.900]  Nick, what is your next pet peeve?
[19:07.200 --> 19:10.560]  This is one Gavin may not know a lot about, but let's take a moment
[19:10.560 --> 19:15.940]  to acknowledge and shit on slow left lane drivers.
[19:16.160 --> 19:17.600]  Get out of the left lane.
[19:17.820 --> 19:19.000]  Get out of the left lane.
[19:19.080 --> 19:20.640]  You're obstructing traffic.
[19:20.960 --> 19:22.380]  Get out of the left lane.
[19:22.700 --> 19:26.480]  You are the reason that there is additional traffic.
[19:26.480 --> 19:28.060]  Oh, but I'm going to speed limit.
[19:28.360 --> 19:29.780]  Who gives a shit? Get out of the way.
[19:29.880 --> 19:30.700]  Do you want a fucking medal?
[19:31.000 --> 19:31.980]  Left lane is for passing.
[19:32.500 --> 19:33.960]  That lane is for passing.
[19:34.240 --> 19:37.040]  There's a law in Texas that if you are not passing,
[19:37.080 --> 19:39.220]  you can be pulled over and don't do it often enough.
[19:39.300 --> 19:40.940]  I say get out of the left lane.
[19:41.200 --> 19:45.120]  Nick, I agree with you that in California, you're just in the left lane
[19:45.120 --> 19:47.640]  and you're cruising like you're flying like that's just that's what it is.
[19:47.700 --> 19:48.860]  Not for passing. It's just for going.
[19:49.360 --> 19:52.060]  But then I moved here and left lane is definitely for passing
[19:52.060 --> 19:53.500]  and not enough people use it.
[19:53.600 --> 19:54.480]  Not enough people do it.
[19:54.540 --> 19:55.620]  And too many people are in it.
[19:55.620 --> 20:00.020]  Yep. It is amazing how many times you see three cars driving perfectly
[20:00.020 --> 20:01.980]  in a line next to each other at the same speed.
[20:02.900 --> 20:06.080]  It's pretty miserable, especially when you have places to be
[20:06.080 --> 20:07.580]  because you don't want to be late.
[20:07.940 --> 20:09.060]  Yep. Crazy.
[20:09.680 --> 20:11.100]  Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
[20:11.160 --> 20:14.900]  Gavin, we're on to your second and then your third peeves.
[20:15.180 --> 20:17.800]  OK, well, I've had to insert an emergency peeve here.
[20:17.960 --> 20:19.780]  Oh, an emergency peeve. Oh, wow.
[20:20.120 --> 20:20.940]  Wonderful, wonderful.
[20:21.100 --> 20:22.100]  As you may have expected.
[20:22.100 --> 20:27.420]  But my second peeve is people who have never edited a video in their life,
[20:27.680 --> 20:31.760]  insisting everyone do something completely unnecessary for editing purposes.
[20:32.320 --> 20:33.920]  30 times in a month.
[20:34.680 --> 20:35.040]  I agree.
[20:35.940 --> 20:37.660]  I feel strongly on this.
[20:37.700 --> 20:38.180]  Yep. What?
[20:39.600 --> 20:41.180]  As someone who has edited videos before.
[20:42.720 --> 20:43.440]  I'm with you.
[20:46.480 --> 20:49.560]  Yeah, it's just, uh, it's unnecessary stuff.
[20:49.780 --> 20:51.040]  It takes up time for no reason.
[20:51.040 --> 20:53.120]  I could be uploading the video already, but instead
[20:54.060 --> 20:56.000]  I'm syncing again for some reason.
[20:56.320 --> 20:57.060]  Why is that happening?
[20:57.420 --> 21:00.440]  You know, it's especially annoying with is, you know, that's five seconds
[21:00.440 --> 21:03.060]  you could be used uploading, which I always do.
[21:03.240 --> 21:04.700]  Always do. Always make sure that upload is.
[21:04.940 --> 21:05.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[21:05.660 --> 21:06.600]  That's actually Andrew.
[21:06.740 --> 21:09.320]  Andrew, honestly, make a pretty good point, buddy.
[21:10.040 --> 21:13.180]  Well, maybe I'd be uploading if I wasn't still recording.
[21:14.960 --> 21:16.560]  You think that's the reason?
[21:17.100 --> 21:18.700]  No, no, it's not.
[21:20.420 --> 21:23.720]  No, no, no, no.
[21:24.500 --> 21:26.520]  OK, good emergency peeve.
[21:26.620 --> 21:28.160]  I like it. I like it.
[21:28.540 --> 21:30.740]  What is your third peeve, Gavin?
[21:31.220 --> 21:36.220]  Oh, you know what I really like when I when I go on a website, right?
[21:36.480 --> 21:39.920]  I really like being asked about cookies all the time.
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.880]  I was just thinking this.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.240]  I always have individual preferences across different websites.
[21:45.420 --> 21:48.220]  Sometimes I want them to save a cookie and sometimes I don't.
[21:50.680 --> 21:52.160]  Shut up. Shut up.
[21:52.240 --> 21:53.740]  Let me do it on a browser level.
[21:53.860 --> 21:59.060]  Let me set one universal thing and just apply that to all the websites.
[21:59.640 --> 22:03.220]  Yeah, I don't think I'm going to have different preferences based on different sites.
[22:03.900 --> 22:04.920]  I just want to eat all the cookies.
[22:05.100 --> 22:06.500]  I was literally thinking this last night.
[22:06.560 --> 22:07.960]  Why can't I just eat all the cookies?
[22:08.360 --> 22:09.960]  Don't ask me. I'll eat the cookies.
[22:10.420 --> 22:11.940]  Don't ask me that.
[22:12.580 --> 22:15.580]  It's it is a it's like an epidemic right now.
[22:15.860 --> 22:17.540]  It's insane. Why is that?
[22:17.540 --> 22:20.060]  Do we know? Do we know why it's happening everywhere all the time now?
[22:20.400 --> 22:26.280]  I think some European law passed that meant that people couldn't do it without asking.
[22:26.500 --> 22:27.760]  So now they ask everyone ever.
[22:28.080 --> 22:30.500]  Do you think there's anyone that refuses to give cookies?
[22:30.580 --> 22:31.960]  Like what websites do they go on?
[22:32.480 --> 22:33.240]  How do they navigate?
[22:33.760 --> 22:38.440]  And I think the reason it keeps asking you is because because it's not saving a cookie.
[22:38.760 --> 22:40.500]  I think it's like a little bit circular.
[22:42.460 --> 22:46.220]  How about Nick, you get us out of cookie conversation.
[22:46.220 --> 22:47.760]  You let us know what your peeve is.
[22:48.100 --> 22:49.300]  I'm going to take us back to nature.
[22:50.060 --> 22:54.260]  How often have you been, let's say, in a public park,
[22:54.560 --> 22:57.600]  maybe hiking the trail, going along the way, right?
[22:57.840 --> 22:59.080]  Come to a fork in the road.
[22:59.620 --> 23:02.000]  It's beautiful, right? There's trees, there's green.
[23:02.440 --> 23:03.140]  There's the river.
[23:03.540 --> 23:04.900]  Oh, what's what's that in the river?
[23:04.960 --> 23:06.340]  What's that by the riverbank right there?
[23:06.760 --> 23:09.080]  Is that a massive turd?
[23:09.720 --> 23:12.260]  Pick up your dog's shit.
[23:13.200 --> 23:17.220]  If you are out and about, pick up your dog's shit.
[23:17.620 --> 23:19.540]  I don't want to step in it. I don't want to fall in it.
[23:19.600 --> 23:21.300]  I don't want my dog trying to sniff it.
[23:21.740 --> 23:23.480]  Pick up your dog's shit. It's everywhere.
[23:23.740 --> 23:25.300]  That would rank much higher than a peeve for me.
[23:25.380 --> 23:27.860]  That's just like awful biohazards.
[23:28.280 --> 23:32.120]  It's interesting because it is a it's a pet peeve in two ways to.
[23:32.380 --> 23:34.880]  Yes, it's true.
[23:35.540 --> 23:37.640]  A pet, pet, pet related peeve.
[23:37.740 --> 23:38.720]  Yep, it is.
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.160]  That's just good to have on the board.
[23:40.160 --> 23:41.440]  That's a dog peeve.
[23:41.640 --> 23:43.280]  Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
[23:43.500 --> 23:44.600]  That I like that one.
[23:45.100 --> 23:46.880]  Andrew, can you top it with your next?
[23:47.180 --> 23:50.640]  Oh, I don't I don't think I can top a pet, a literal pet peeve.
[23:50.800 --> 23:55.900]  OK, but what I can submit is a deep, deep frustration, deep annoyance.
[23:56.840 --> 24:00.340]  People tagging me that I don't know in any way.
[24:00.540 --> 24:01.640]  Can't stand it.
[24:01.740 --> 24:02.700]  Don't like it.
[24:02.860 --> 24:05.260]  If I'm on TikTok, I don't know you.
[24:05.360 --> 24:06.400]  Don't tag me, man.
[24:06.580 --> 24:08.480]  Don't tag me. That's my fortress of solitude.
[24:08.480 --> 24:12.920]  I'm here to just watch some dumb videos here to have a good time.
[24:13.020 --> 24:14.880]  I don't need to know what you think is good.
[24:14.960 --> 24:15.760]  I don't know you.
[24:15.920 --> 24:17.280]  I don't care about your opinions.
[24:17.600 --> 24:19.660]  Yep. Get out of here. Get out of here.
[24:19.880 --> 24:20.340]  That's crazy.
[24:20.460 --> 24:22.260]  That was going to be my next peeve.
[24:22.360 --> 24:24.580]  And you got it right up from under me.
[24:24.620 --> 24:25.280]  Way to go, man.
[24:25.660 --> 24:26.620]  I can't believe that.
[24:26.860 --> 24:28.140]  Well, don't at me, peeve.
[24:28.360 --> 24:29.600]  Don't at me is a great way.
[24:30.700 --> 24:31.700]  I just don't.
[24:31.780 --> 24:33.300]  That's why I'm going to change that. Don't at me.
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.180]  Don't at me.
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.000]  I just don't get how I could.
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.020]  I can't be more clear about don't do it.
[24:41.180 --> 24:42.920]  And then people go, right.
[24:43.060 --> 24:44.280]  I can't believe they do that anyway.
[24:44.420 --> 24:45.760]  Hey, dude, you got to check this out.
[24:45.840 --> 24:50.280]  And it's like, do you think this doesn't apply to who do you think you are?
[24:50.600 --> 24:51.880]  What are you talking about?
[24:52.000 --> 24:52.900]  This is a one way street.
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.600]  It goes out. Leave it that way.
[24:54.840 --> 24:56.440]  This is it. That's all I want.
[24:56.520 --> 24:57.600]  Just don't at me ever.
[24:57.760 --> 24:59.240]  Is this mainly a TikTok thing?
[24:59.620 --> 25:00.720]  No, this is everything.
[25:00.860 --> 25:01.840]  This is all the time.
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.440]  A guy literally just messaged me and said, dude, I have an idea
[25:05.440 --> 25:06.560]  for such a funny shirt.
[25:07.260 --> 25:08.740]  What are you doing?
[25:09.040 --> 25:10.180]  Leave me alone.
[25:10.400 --> 25:11.780]  What? Who are you?
[25:12.100 --> 25:13.120]  Leave me alone.
[25:13.620 --> 25:15.520]  Leave me alone.
[25:15.720 --> 25:16.720]  Talk to anyone else.
[25:16.900 --> 25:17.460]  That's crazy.
[25:18.180 --> 25:19.800]  I don't agree with this one at all.
[25:20.220 --> 25:22.660]  Should we rethink making Eric head of customer service?
[25:24.100 --> 25:26.840]  Yeah, I don't know why I volunteered for that right out the gate.
[25:26.900 --> 25:28.060]  That was such a bad idea.
[25:28.380 --> 25:29.180]  That's on me.
[25:29.360 --> 25:34.520]  It is a level of annoyance, too, when it is like there are certain videos
[25:34.520 --> 25:37.940]  that it's like so obviously like, oh, one of you would love this.
[25:38.300 --> 25:39.760]  But I just don't send because they're popular.
[25:39.900 --> 25:41.200]  And I know that you've seen it already.
[25:41.460 --> 25:43.400]  And you've been sent it 50,000 times.
[25:43.480 --> 25:46.100]  And it's just like, I don't want to like, I know you would like this.
[25:46.120 --> 25:48.480]  But the odds of you having not seen it are so low.
[25:48.760 --> 25:49.640]  Yeah. Yeah. You saw.
[25:49.780 --> 25:54.620]  Also, I'm online way more than people who are tagging me and stuff.
[25:54.780 --> 25:55.940]  So I've already seen it.
[25:56.300 --> 25:58.000]  Don't. There's no need. I've seen it.
[25:58.020 --> 25:58.660]  Don't worry about it.
[25:58.660 --> 26:00.320]  See this lady on the grapes?
[26:00.680 --> 26:02.060]  Yeah. Dude, have you seen this?
[26:02.140 --> 26:03.360]  Dude, have you seen this Snoopy thing?
[26:03.360 --> 26:05.100]  Absolutely. Hundred percent.
[26:05.360 --> 26:06.100]  No, thanks, man.
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.000]  Leave me alone. Appreciate it.
[26:08.320 --> 26:10.180]  My next one actually has to do with TikTok.
[26:11.880 --> 26:15.640]  TikTok continuing to show me videos
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.100]  that I say not interested to.
[26:23.420 --> 26:27.860]  There is an option to say I am not interested.
[26:28.260 --> 26:31.580]  I am telling the app I'm not interested.
[26:31.580 --> 26:37.360]  And the app is going, hmm, I think I can change your mind about this one.
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.480]  And it wants to continue to show me
[26:41.740 --> 26:44.720]  I like war videos,
[26:45.880 --> 26:48.900]  like the most insane shit.
[26:49.060 --> 26:51.440]  I'm trying to get on TikTok for very specific stuff.
[26:51.680 --> 26:54.800]  And the things it's trying to show me, I'm not interested in.
[26:54.900 --> 26:57.300]  And I try to tell it, hey, check out these people dancing.
[26:57.660 --> 27:00.640]  No, never in my life do I want to see these people dancing.
[27:00.640 --> 27:01.660]  That's not why I'm here.
[27:01.880 --> 27:06.600]  I'm here for the weird cartel videos shot on a Nokia phone.
[27:06.980 --> 27:08.920]  That's what I'm on TikTok for. Give me more of that.
[27:10.120 --> 27:12.160]  Yeah. Oh, do you not get cartel videos?
[27:12.500 --> 27:13.580]  I don't use TikTok.
[27:13.960 --> 27:15.420]  Oh, you're you're missing out.
[27:15.520 --> 27:19.380]  It's a lot of guys on speedboats that show you all like the bricks of stuff
[27:19.380 --> 27:20.800]  that they have in the back.
[27:21.480 --> 27:25.180]  It's so it's so cool.
[27:25.420 --> 27:28.200]  It's the best. But I don't get enough of that.
[27:28.200 --> 27:31.400]  I get too many people dancing or whatever, and it's like, get this out of here.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.520]  I don't want that. So TikTok, knock it off.
[27:33.840 --> 27:37.780]  That's mine. And now Geoff with his final two peeves.
[27:38.160 --> 27:42.920]  OK, for number three, this is a this is a pet peeve that I admittedly don't
[27:42.920 --> 27:46.860]  encounter often anymore because we are work from home these days.
[27:47.840 --> 27:51.660]  But I respect soda and I respect carbonation.
[27:51.800 --> 27:55.880]  And so when I work with people and I don't want to call anyone out individually,
[27:55.880 --> 27:59.600]  I don't want to specifically name one person, Bernie Burns,
[28:00.600 --> 28:03.780]  who might do this and have done this in the past.
[28:03.820 --> 28:07.900]  But I can't fucking stand when you co-work with somebody
[28:07.900 --> 28:12.380]  and you share a refrigerator full of amazing, delicious sodas with somebody.
[28:12.460 --> 28:17.340]  Or maybe it's even like Waterloo Carbonated Waters or, you know, whatever.
[28:17.600 --> 28:21.020]  It doesn't have to be soda, just a cold carbonated drink.
[28:21.380 --> 28:23.720]  And they take a drink out and they open it and they take a sip
[28:23.720 --> 28:27.780]  and then they put it down and then they erase the existence of that drink
[28:27.780 --> 28:28.780]  from their memory.
[28:28.900 --> 28:32.580]  So 30 minutes later, when they're thirsty, they go, huh?
[28:32.780 --> 28:35.560]  And they go back into the fridge and they open up another Diet
[28:35.560 --> 28:38.240]  Dr. Pepper and pop it open and they take one sip of that.
[28:38.400 --> 28:39.500]  I have worked with some people.
[28:39.540 --> 28:41.300]  And once again, I don't want to call anybody out individually
[28:41.300 --> 28:43.080]  because I've worked with hundreds and hundreds of people.
[28:43.280 --> 28:44.200]  Bernie exactly burns.
[28:44.880 --> 28:47.680]  But I've seen I've seen dudes
[28:47.680 --> 28:52.800]  destroy a 12 pack of Diet Coke in 14 sips.
[28:54.300 --> 28:57.540]  It's it's like a it's an assassination is what it is.
[28:57.600 --> 28:59.640]  And it's so wasteful.
[28:59.660 --> 29:02.580]  And then you're like, hey, hey, we don't need more Coke
[29:02.580 --> 29:05.040]  because you have seven over there. Just drink those.
[29:05.080 --> 29:07.660]  They go, oh, well, they're flat or oh, they're warm now.
[29:07.720 --> 29:13.860]  It's like, oh, maybe there should be tiny little shot sized six packs of cans.
[29:14.640 --> 29:16.200]  They kind of exist, actually.
[29:16.220 --> 29:18.440]  They have the little have the minis. Yeah, yeah.
[29:19.240 --> 29:21.560]  Which are more expensive, but contain less liquid.
[29:21.560 --> 29:23.180]  I don't understand who the minis are for.
[29:23.460 --> 29:24.600]  I guess we know now.
[29:25.040 --> 29:26.820]  Anyway, lots of people have done that throughout the years.
[29:26.880 --> 29:28.840]  I don't want to call anybody individually, but it's something
[29:28.840 --> 29:30.180]  that's always bugged the shit out of me.
[29:30.240 --> 29:32.860]  And it's so wasteful and disrespectful of carbonation.
[29:34.080 --> 29:37.640]  Disrespectful of carbonation, especially if they're not replenishing.
[29:38.000 --> 29:39.780]  Yeah. Is that a finite thing like helium?
[29:40.100 --> 29:41.340]  I don't want to find out, dude.
[29:41.420 --> 29:44.680]  What what what happens when we find out the world is running out of carbonation?
[29:45.060 --> 29:48.160]  Think of all the flat cokes that carbonation was wasted on.
[29:49.420 --> 29:51.160]  Ridiculous. All right.
[29:51.560 --> 29:56.020]  I guess for my last one, from my pile of 200 more pet peeves,
[29:56.780 --> 29:57.940]  I'm going to take this one.
[29:58.140 --> 30:03.300]  This is when you go out to a meal with friends or co-workers or whoever.
[30:03.540 --> 30:05.660]  You go out to maybe six, seven, eight people sitting around a table
[30:06.140 --> 30:08.960]  and the waiter or waitress comes over and they say, can I take your drinks?
[30:09.020 --> 30:10.680]  And they go, yeah, I don't think Diet Coke, water.
[30:10.780 --> 30:13.200]  Everybody takes their drinks and they hand out menus and they say,
[30:13.280 --> 30:15.600]  I'll be back in a few minutes to take your order.
[30:16.000 --> 30:19.900]  And then five to nine, 12 minutes later, they come back and they go,
[30:19.960 --> 30:20.880]  is everybody ready to order?
[30:20.880 --> 30:23.500]  And, you know, three or four or five people all go, yeah.
[30:24.020 --> 30:27.780]  And then they this person starts to take orders and they go,
[30:27.820 --> 30:29.580]  what would you like? And I'll take the mushroom Swiss burger.
[30:29.660 --> 30:31.800]  What would you like? I'll have I'll have the ravioli.
[30:31.900 --> 30:33.580]  What would you like? I'll take the soup, please.
[30:33.680 --> 30:36.900]  Gazpacho. And they go to you and they go, oh, oh, geez.
[30:37.180 --> 30:40.600]  Oh, man, I don't can skip me.
[30:40.680 --> 30:44.340]  Come back to me later. Oh, what are you doing?
[30:45.080 --> 30:48.880]  Everybody has the same menu and the same allotted amount of time
[30:48.880 --> 30:50.740]  to figure out what you want to eat.
[30:50.900 --> 30:53.880]  You only like seven things on earth anyway.
[30:54.040 --> 30:55.460]  Pick one of those seven things.
[30:55.980 --> 30:59.700]  Also, 98% of the time you've been here before, dickhead.
[30:59.840 --> 31:01.820]  You already know what you're going to order.
[31:02.200 --> 31:04.360]  And two, what's wrong with a little bit of preparation?
[31:04.560 --> 31:06.680]  You're sitting in the car in the Uber on the way over.
[31:06.960 --> 31:08.360]  Look up the menu ahead of time.
[31:08.480 --> 31:09.680]  Know what you're walking into.
[31:09.980 --> 31:14.080]  Have an idea of what might be good or I don't know, maybe make an on the spot
[31:14.080 --> 31:18.180]  decision. It's not you're not it's not Sophie's choice here.
[31:18.180 --> 31:20.880]  We're not picking which kid we're going to put a fucking bullet in.
[31:20.980 --> 31:24.560]  We're picking. Do I want the mozzarella sticks or the chimichangas?
[31:25.020 --> 31:26.320]  Jesus Christ.
[31:26.400 --> 31:29.380]  And then also they give you a cheat sheet.
[31:29.460 --> 31:32.620]  It's in front of you and it's multiple choice.
[31:32.820 --> 31:35.260]  You don't have to write anything in.
[31:35.620 --> 31:38.000]  Just pick A, B, C or D.
[31:38.740 --> 31:41.120]  They give you a cheat sheet.
[31:41.700 --> 31:43.620]  Never thought of a menu as a cheat sheet.
[31:43.720 --> 31:44.500]  I like that.
[31:45.460 --> 31:45.620]  Damn.
[31:46.600 --> 31:47.620]  All right, it's my last.
[31:47.620 --> 31:50.440]  Imagine if there weren't menus and you just had to guess.
[31:50.620 --> 31:51.360]  You got to wing it.
[31:51.480 --> 31:52.520]  Can I get the ravioli?
[31:52.760 --> 31:54.560]  Oh, we don't we don't have that.
[31:54.840 --> 31:56.540]  Yeah, that's not what this is.
[31:56.920 --> 31:59.040]  Different restaurant, buddy.
[32:00.400 --> 32:01.120]  Let's see.
[32:01.200 --> 32:02.500]  It's down to my last one.
[32:02.720 --> 32:04.320]  This one's going to be a real simple one.
[32:04.700 --> 32:06.720]  This one's real straightforward to me.
[32:07.080 --> 32:08.860]  And it is a bad handshake.
[32:09.400 --> 32:12.680]  Oh, it makes me nuts.
[32:14.820 --> 32:15.780]  So specific.
[32:16.360 --> 32:18.540]  It happens so much.
[32:19.340 --> 32:20.020]  I hate it.
[32:20.460 --> 32:21.340]  It is miserable.
[32:21.800 --> 32:26.240]  So a thing in pro wrestling is when you get there and you go backstage,
[32:26.240 --> 32:28.120]  you're supposed to shake everyone's hand.
[32:28.240 --> 32:31.620]  It's a way where like if you're out of town talent or whatever,
[32:31.680 --> 32:33.300]  it's a way to introduce you to everyone.
[32:33.440 --> 32:36.160]  And that's like it's the easy way to like make that happen.
[32:36.740 --> 32:40.380]  The amount of times where I always do the handshake,
[32:40.400 --> 32:43.720]  but there are guys who do try to do like the fist bump.
[32:44.240 --> 32:47.600]  And then I change to the fist bump and they change to the handshake.
[32:47.680 --> 32:48.740]  And it's like this.
[32:48.820 --> 32:52.200]  I'm like, just just let's pretend like we never met.
[32:52.200 --> 32:54.240]  Let's just I'm never going to see you again.
[32:54.400 --> 32:55.640]  Let's not worry about this one.
[32:55.700 --> 32:56.640]  And let's call it a day.
[32:56.840 --> 32:58.200]  That is I hate it.
[32:58.260 --> 32:59.560]  It's a miserable thing.
[32:59.640 --> 33:04.100]  And then sometimes you get the handshake where they close too early
[33:04.100 --> 33:05.380]  or you close too early.
[33:05.380 --> 33:06.620]  And then you're just like, what?
[33:07.320 --> 33:08.780]  What is this like?
[33:08.780 --> 33:11.160]  We're just holding hands bad style.
[33:11.360 --> 33:12.020]  I hate it.
[33:12.020 --> 33:14.800]  And like you're just holding fingers like a bundle of straws.
[33:14.820 --> 33:16.040]  Yeah, it's the worst.
[33:16.380 --> 33:17.400]  I'm so with you, Eric.
[33:17.520 --> 33:21.460]  I had a handshake in nineteen ninety five that was so bad.
[33:21.580 --> 33:23.660]  I still think about it sometimes.
[33:23.980 --> 33:25.340]  It sticks with you, man.
[33:25.480 --> 33:27.940]  I'm going to do the handshake to you next time I see you.
[33:28.180 --> 33:32.260]  And it will blow your mind how bad this handshake was.
[33:32.680 --> 33:35.940]  It was the saddest, limpest, grossest thing ever.
[33:36.100 --> 33:38.100]  It stuck with me for 30 years.
[33:38.360 --> 33:41.480]  Damn. That's an interesting peeve, because I really love it
[33:41.480 --> 33:44.720]  when it when you see it happen to other people, like on the Sloppy Joe stream.
[33:44.780 --> 33:47.500]  Oh, yeah, the handshake was like the highlight of the whole stream for me.
[33:47.780 --> 33:50.900]  Oh, a bad handshake to witness is so great.
[33:51.180 --> 33:51.380]  Ridiculous.
[33:52.020 --> 33:54.080]  Well, those are all my peeves.
[33:54.140 --> 33:56.880]  But we go to Andrew to round it out with his final peeve.
[33:56.960 --> 33:58.180]  Oh, my last peeve.
[33:58.220 --> 34:01.540]  And this one is maybe the worst of all of them for me.
[34:01.800 --> 34:05.860]  Nothing gets me more stressed, more annoyed, more just upset.
[34:06.020 --> 34:08.720]  People not respecting their feet.
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.480]  My last pick is wearing shoes that can seal your feet in the summertime.
[34:14.760 --> 34:16.040]  That's sandal time, baby.
[34:16.340 --> 34:18.120]  Get their dogs out. Let's see their feet.
[34:18.300 --> 34:19.700]  Let's get them feet out there.
[34:20.280 --> 34:22.300]  I don't want to see you runners in the summertime.
[34:22.960 --> 34:25.540]  It's hot. You gotta respect the feet.
[34:25.740 --> 34:26.580]  Let them breathe.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.560]  Let them just be out and about.
[34:30.360 --> 34:32.760]  People not respecting their feet.
[34:33.360 --> 34:34.120]  The hell?
[34:34.380 --> 34:35.500]  I want to see them out and about.
[34:35.880 --> 34:37.960]  This is a great peeve, man. This is a good one.
[34:37.960 --> 34:39.520]  I'll just be walking down the street.
[34:39.640 --> 34:41.740]  I'll just see shoes left and right in the summertime.
[34:42.160 --> 34:43.620]  Yeah, in the summertime? Get real.
[34:43.780 --> 34:45.760]  Oh, come on. I'm with you, man.
[34:45.780 --> 34:48.740]  When the weather is fine, you're wearing your runners?
[34:50.500 --> 34:51.500]  Out of here.
[34:51.880 --> 34:54.060]  No. Oh, man.
[34:57.060 --> 35:01.140]  Well, Nick, since yours just got taken, what's your final peeve?
[35:02.420 --> 35:04.080]  I'm thinking about pivoting it now.
[35:04.240 --> 35:06.280]  Let me see. Do I want to go with the original?
[35:06.280 --> 35:14.200]  Well, you guys know from a previous draft that I enjoy mowing my lawn.
[35:14.600 --> 35:14.800]  Mm.
[35:15.240 --> 35:18.980]  I like mowing my lawn because it's that getaway time.
[35:19.120 --> 35:20.480]  It's the time where I can think about stuff.
[35:20.840 --> 35:24.420]  But there's one thing about mowing lawns that I don't care for.
[35:24.640 --> 35:29.640]  And that is when somebody, your neighbor, someone down the street,
[35:29.720 --> 35:32.260]  whatever, someone in the neighborhood, is mowing over weeds.
[35:32.920 --> 35:34.360]  Don't be mowing over weeds.
[35:35.580 --> 35:38.040]  Greg, stop mowing over your weeds, Greg.
[35:38.420 --> 35:42.020]  And getting your, you know, you're spreading the seed of the weed
[35:42.020 --> 35:45.020]  everywhere when you run over the weed with the mower.
[35:45.520 --> 35:47.040]  And it's causing more weeds.
[35:47.280 --> 35:49.300]  That's why you have them. That's why I have them.
[35:49.520 --> 35:52.480]  That's it. Pull the weeds before you mow them. Greg?
[35:55.520 --> 35:57.620]  Sorry, I might have narrow cast there.
[35:57.740 --> 35:58.760]  Whoo. Oh, boy.
[35:58.960 --> 36:02.720]  I genuinely hope Greg is a real person named Greg.
[36:05.080 --> 36:08.360]  Just imagine Nick Furious looking out the window at Greg.
[36:09.060 --> 36:10.960]  He's mowing over the weeds.
[36:11.180 --> 36:12.920]  As he's chopping up his weeds.
[36:13.460 --> 36:16.160]  Thinks he's doing a nice thing for the fucking whole neighborhood
[36:16.160 --> 36:17.400]  by beautifying his front yard.
[36:18.420 --> 36:20.580]  He doesn't happen to work in finance, does he, Nick?
[36:23.440 --> 36:24.240]  Oh, man.
[36:24.860 --> 36:27.560]  Great, great one to end yours on, Nick.
[36:27.600 --> 36:29.700]  But we go to Gavin, who started it.
[36:29.760 --> 36:32.120]  He's going to close us out. His final peeve.
[36:32.120 --> 36:34.700]  Is this your turbo peeve or is this just a peeve?
[36:35.020 --> 36:37.340]  It's my turbo peeve. Turbo peeve.
[36:37.480 --> 36:40.260]  The turbo peeve. Turbo peeve.
[36:40.620 --> 36:44.100]  I think later in life, if I could do it, I'm going to spend some
[36:44.100 --> 36:45.360]  spend some serious money.
[36:45.420 --> 36:47.760]  The remainder, I'm going to put it in my will to put money
[36:47.760 --> 36:50.020]  towards abolishing the leaf blower.
[36:50.100 --> 36:50.900]  I hate it so much.
[36:52.640 --> 36:54.940]  Shut up. Shut up, you idiot.
[36:55.320 --> 36:57.060]  Shut up. Shut up.
[36:57.180 --> 36:58.060]  It's so funny.
[36:58.060 --> 37:02.120]  Tuesday, idiots coming around blowing leaves across the road.
[37:02.340 --> 37:03.440]  Oh, now it's Wednesday.
[37:03.560 --> 37:04.720]  Let's blow them all back.
[37:04.960 --> 37:07.460]  Now they're in the street. Blow it all over people's cars.
[37:07.980 --> 37:09.520]  Shut up. Shut up.
[37:09.820 --> 37:12.040]  It's called a broom, idiot. Use a broom.
[37:12.360 --> 37:14.600]  Oh, man. I agree with Gavin.
[37:14.820 --> 37:15.480]  Good call, Gavin.
[37:15.600 --> 37:17.680]  I hate. I just seriously.
[37:19.000 --> 37:20.140]  Fumic of a leaf blower.
[37:20.320 --> 37:20.960]  I can tell.
[37:21.560 --> 37:26.280]  Did you just recommend people out in their yard with brooms sweeping up leaves, Nick?
[37:26.280 --> 37:29.680]  No, on the street or the driveway or the sidewalk.
[37:29.840 --> 37:31.220]  They can use rakes in the yard.
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.120]  Use a rake, maybe.
[37:32.440 --> 37:33.420]  Yeah, in the yard.
[37:33.900 --> 37:35.440]  Oh, yeah. Use the rake on the driveway.
[37:36.080 --> 37:37.240]  My outdoor broom.
[37:38.540 --> 37:40.300]  There are outdoor brooms. What are you talking about?
[37:40.360 --> 37:40.860]  That's true, though.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.520]  I'm typically using my driveway rake when I'm done mowing my weeds.
[37:49.040 --> 37:51.580]  Yeah. So I got to clean all those up so they don't go in Nick's yard.
[37:51.800 --> 37:54.700]  Well, you got to aerate them so they can, you know, plant better.
[37:54.820 --> 37:55.460]  We've done it.
[37:55.460 --> 37:57.340]  It's the it's the Peeves draft.
[37:57.580 --> 37:58.380]  Let's run them down.
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.060]  You guys can let us know in the comments who had the peeves that you agree
[38:03.060 --> 38:03.480]  with the most.
[38:03.620 --> 38:06.960]  Gavin had full email and password sign in with two factor authentication
[38:06.960 --> 38:08.060]  using a TV remote.
[38:08.300 --> 38:12.500]  People who have never edited it, insisting on something for editing purposes.
[38:13.360 --> 38:17.220]  Being asked about cookies on websites and the leaf blower.
[38:17.980 --> 38:22.360]  Nick has supreme pizzas at parties, slow left lane drivers,
[38:22.360 --> 38:25.680]  not picking up dog poop and people who mow over weeds.
[38:26.360 --> 38:31.860]  Andrew, expected to get a video less than 10 minutes.
[38:32.240 --> 38:33.380]  The word collab.
[38:33.740 --> 38:37.480]  Don't at me. People not respecting their feet.
[38:40.880 --> 38:43.500]  I have unexpected updates.
[38:43.780 --> 38:46.600]  Being late, TikTok continuing to show me videos
[38:46.600 --> 38:49.020]  that I say not interested to and bad handshakes.
[38:49.540 --> 38:53.160]  And Geoff has hotel virtual check-in not working.
[38:53.320 --> 38:57.340]  The oblivious public, single soda sippers and forgetters.
[38:57.840 --> 39:01.620]  And come to me last orderers.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.920]  That is our peeves.
[39:04.180 --> 39:05.480]  These are great peeves.
[39:05.980 --> 39:07.440]  I agree with Geoff.
[39:07.660 --> 39:11.340]  I have I was writing down additional peeves as we were doing this, too.
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.020]  So I definitely think that we should do another one of these.
[39:15.180 --> 39:18.120]  But before we do, you guys should let us know in the comments
[39:18.120 --> 39:19.160]  what your peeves are.
[39:19.280 --> 39:22.680]  What did we leave off this list in our first ever peeves draft?
[39:22.800 --> 39:24.720]  What's the peeve that gets you?
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.300]  Does it also have to do with feet?
[39:26.580 --> 39:27.720]  Let us know in the comments.
[39:27.900 --> 39:29.680]  Let people know about this draft.
[39:29.800 --> 39:31.960]  Let people know about the podcast and the gameplay videos.
[39:32.100 --> 39:35.900]  And you can get more of this at Patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[39:36.320 --> 39:37.900]  Fellas, good peeves draft.
[39:38.080 --> 39:40.000]  Man, who knew Andrew liked feet so much?
[39:41.220 --> 39:42.940]  I listen. You need to let him breathe.
[39:44.260 --> 39:47.420]  I think this is the one where I'm most excited to hear the peeves
[39:47.420 --> 39:49.380]  or to hear the draft picks of the audience.
[39:49.580 --> 39:50.140]  Oh, I agree.
[39:50.400 --> 39:52.280]  So many where I'm like, oh, it's so good.
[39:52.480 --> 39:53.620]  I can't believe I didn't draft it.
[39:53.820 --> 39:55.620]  I think they're going to be a lot like that.
[39:55.900 --> 39:57.980]  But we'll have to wait and see what those are.
[39:58.060 --> 40:01.360]  And then you can see what our next picks are in our next peeves drafts.
[40:01.380 --> 40:03.340]  Until then, we'll see you next time. Bye.
[40:03.940 --> 40:04.240]  Bye.
[40:06.480 --> 40:09.660]  Now, is it going to offend anyone to tailsync?
[40:10.020 --> 40:12.600]  Yeah. Is there enough time in this video that we need to tailsync, Gavin?
[40:13.180 --> 40:14.340]  Oh, yeah, we absolutely should. Yeah.
