[00:00.000 --> 00:03.720]  Hello and welcome to another regulation draft.
[00:03.860 --> 00:10.300]  Today, we are going to be determining the 20 greatest robots of all time.
[00:10.380 --> 00:15.080]  At least as I understand it, this is a Gavin idea, so correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:15.360 --> 00:16.600]  But that's what we're doing today, right?
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.540]  Yeah, he was very adamant that we do it first also.
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.660]  So yeah, this all feels like Gavin.
[00:21.880 --> 00:22.880]  I will correct you.
[00:23.200 --> 00:23.680]  Oh, what?
[00:23.760 --> 00:24.160]  Oh, okay.
[00:24.520 --> 00:25.100]  You are wrong.
[00:25.680 --> 00:26.980]  What am I wrong about?
[00:27.240 --> 00:27.400]  Huh?
[00:27.840 --> 00:28.740]  About robots.
[00:30.820 --> 00:31.220]  Okay.
[00:33.120 --> 00:39.080]  This would be where you'd expound upon that if you would like the fucking draft to continue.
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.400]  Are you joking, dude?
[00:40.600 --> 00:43.100]  Like, say the rest of your words.
[00:43.500 --> 00:46.780]  Oh, you said correct me if I'm wrong, if it's Gavin's idea, and I said you were wrong.
[00:47.600 --> 00:48.580]  All right, so what's the correction?
[00:48.900 --> 00:50.020]  I don't know whose idea it is.
[00:50.280 --> 00:51.120]  Okay, this sucks.
[00:52.680 --> 00:55.320]  All right, we're doing a Gavin idea today.
[00:55.460 --> 00:56.740]  It's robot draft.
[00:57.720 --> 01:02.320]  Eric, he just came in and said point of order and then sat there.
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.080]  Gavin's at the point where he's just saying words he's heard other people say.
[01:08.240 --> 01:12.380]  Okay, doesn't understand the context behind them or what they're meant to do.
[01:13.460 --> 01:18.600]  How many times are we going to randomize before we determine who goes first?
[01:18.720 --> 01:19.380]  Five as in robot.
[01:19.940 --> 01:21.100]  There we go. I'm fine with that.
[01:21.160 --> 01:21.480]  There you go.
[01:21.940 --> 01:22.280]  Excellent.
[01:22.440 --> 01:23.200]  Five it is.
[01:23.200 --> 01:32.100]  As always, we're using Sean Bear's website, the regulation draft generator,
[01:36.140 --> 01:38.400]  which you can use as well if you want to do drafts with your friends.
[01:38.540 --> 01:39.960]  We're going to randomize five times.
[01:40.000 --> 01:40.660]  Here we go.
[01:40.860 --> 01:41.380]  Rolls on.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.920]  One, two, stop.
[01:43.100 --> 01:43.460]  Three.
[01:43.880 --> 01:44.300]  I'm almost done.
[01:44.400 --> 01:45.220]  Four. Here's four.
[01:45.320 --> 01:46.560]  This is where it would stand if it was four.
[01:46.700 --> 01:48.780]  Eric, Nick, Gavin, Andrew, Geoff.
[01:48.840 --> 01:52.000]  And remember, this is a snake draft, so five will go twice in a row.
[01:52.080 --> 01:52.720]  And here we go.
[01:53.220 --> 01:56.100]  We are going Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Geoff.
[01:59.340 --> 02:01.260]  I'm on an end for once.
[02:01.640 --> 02:04.020]  Yeah, it's always funny when you're in the middle.
[02:04.680 --> 02:05.340]  No, it's not.
[02:07.920 --> 02:08.860]  Point of order.
[02:09.540 --> 02:10.100]  No, it's not.
[02:12.060 --> 02:12.540]  Overruled.
[02:14.560 --> 02:16.320]  Well, this was Gavin's idea.
[02:16.420 --> 02:17.640]  He really wanted to do robots first.
[02:17.720 --> 02:18.100]  So guess what?
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.120]  He gets the first pick.
[02:19.240 --> 02:23.040]  Gavin, what's your number one with a bullet pick?
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.940]  A number one best robot ever.
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.660]  Oh, you know what I like?
[02:27.720 --> 02:31.160]  I like robots from back in the day when they used to be called robots.
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.940]  And I think the best example of that is the little robot from the Twilight Zone.
[02:38.460 --> 02:40.960]  Oh, was there a time when they were called robots?
[02:41.600 --> 02:44.340]  For some reason, you watch a bunch of old black and white shit.
[02:44.400 --> 02:45.480]  They're always calling them robots.
[02:45.860 --> 02:48.220]  Really? That's great.
[02:48.520 --> 02:49.600]  I didn't know that.
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.540]  Is there like an episode this is from or am I just writing Twilight Zone Robot?
[02:55.300 --> 02:55.980]  Well, I put a picture.
[02:56.580 --> 02:58.560]  I can't remember what episode it's from, but I remember seeing it.
[02:58.880 --> 03:01.080]  It was pretty mobile, pretty cool.
[03:01.720 --> 03:02.180]  Pretty black and white.
[03:02.720 --> 03:03.280]  Oh, wow.
[03:03.700 --> 03:04.260]  You know, it's weird.
[03:04.340 --> 03:09.400]  I've seen this robot, or sorry, robot, but I don't know anything else about it.
[03:09.640 --> 03:10.200]  Oh, interesting.
[03:10.520 --> 03:12.120]  Yeah, well, you've seen him in other stuff too,
[03:12.200 --> 03:15.620]  because he looks pretty much identical to the robot that was on that TV show.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.520]  What was it called?
[03:17.940 --> 03:18.620]  The Jetsons?
[03:19.820 --> 03:22.920]  No, I'm gonna say Flash Gordon.
[03:25.040 --> 03:30.320]  He looks like every robot from everything that was from the 1950s and 1960s.
[03:30.340 --> 03:32.340]  I shared the same robot between studios.
[03:32.600 --> 03:34.080]  Yeah, what the fuck was it called?
[03:34.160 --> 03:34.980]  Why can't I think of it?
[03:35.080 --> 03:35.760]  Lost in Space.
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.640]  Oh, yeah, he does look like the Lost in Space robot.
[03:39.000 --> 03:39.880]  Daniel Robinson.
[03:41.500 --> 03:42.340]  Good robot.
[03:42.760 --> 03:44.600]  That's a good robot, but not the one you picked.
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.420]  You happened to pick this robot, which is from the Twilight Zone,
[03:47.420 --> 03:48.820]  and his name is Twilight Zone Robot.
[03:49.460 --> 03:51.480]  So Twilight Zone Robot is number one.
[03:51.800 --> 03:54.400]  Number one best robot pick from Gavin.
[03:54.760 --> 03:57.900]  You also called him a little robot, which is weird because he's human size.
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.300]  But that's neither here nor there, I suppose.
[04:00.440 --> 04:03.040]  He's smaller than like Mechagodzilla and stuff.
[04:03.380 --> 04:04.520]  He is most things.
[04:04.660 --> 04:07.520]  I think we're smaller than Mechagodzilla, but I don't, you know.
[04:08.060 --> 04:10.740]  Mechagodzilla is an insane scale to work from.
[04:10.740 --> 04:13.040]  Yeah, a robot.
[04:13.580 --> 04:17.660]  So to you, a robot that's normal size is Mechagodzilla.
[04:18.140 --> 04:20.700]  Everything else is smaller or everything.
[04:21.680 --> 04:23.400]  Shit, I should have picked Mechagodzilla.
[04:26.660 --> 04:31.480]  That's the bog standard regulation robot size, Mechagodzilla.
[04:32.320 --> 04:32.840]  Wow.
[04:33.300 --> 04:33.960]  Wow.
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.440]  Okay, well, we go to Nick to see what his first pick in this robot draft is.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.040]  Well, it's the coolest, slickest, scariest robot that you can remember from the 90s.
[04:47.120 --> 04:50.780]  And your parents are dead because it's the T-1000.
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.440]  Wow, T-1000 is a good one.
[04:53.740 --> 04:54.460]  That's pretty cool.
[04:55.060 --> 04:55.820]  It's a good pick.
[04:56.060 --> 04:57.320]  Is it really a robot though?
[04:57.340 --> 04:58.260]  Because it's just metal.
[04:58.820 --> 05:04.580]  It was on every list of best robots in film all time that I read.
[05:04.820 --> 05:05.640]  So I would say yes.
[05:06.020 --> 05:06.540]  Interesting.
[05:06.920 --> 05:08.440]  Why does it being all metal?
[05:08.820 --> 05:10.080]  It just doesn't have any electronics.
[05:10.080 --> 05:11.800]  It's just liquid metal, isn't it?
[05:12.260 --> 05:13.840]  Well, I think the whole thing is electronics.
[05:14.000 --> 05:15.660]  They turned electronics into liquid metal.
[05:15.840 --> 05:16.940]  I think that's what it was, right?
[05:17.160 --> 05:18.680]  Yeah, that was the technology.
[05:18.980 --> 05:19.320]  You know what?
[05:19.360 --> 05:19.720]  Fair play.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.180]  If it's conductive, it's a robot.
[05:21.520 --> 05:23.440]  Yeah, it's a pre-nanotech shit.
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.700]  I think we talked about this on 100% Eat the other day.
[05:25.920 --> 05:30.940]  When the head split in half like that, that is like the coolest thing in a movie.
[05:31.100 --> 05:32.080]  I think that rocks.
[05:32.300 --> 05:33.540]  That's a practical effect.
[05:33.860 --> 05:34.720]  Yeah, yes.
[05:34.980 --> 05:36.080]  That's a prop you could buy.
[05:36.400 --> 05:36.820]  It's a puppet.
[05:37.280 --> 05:37.720]  Oh, is it really?
[05:37.840 --> 05:37.980]  Wow.
[05:38.060 --> 05:38.360]  Yeah.
[05:38.360 --> 05:41.480]  Well, it's smaller than Mechagodzilla, so I don't know.
[05:41.520 --> 05:42.260]  He is small.
[05:42.360 --> 05:43.240]  He's a little guy.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.660]  He's just a little guy.
[05:48.860 --> 05:50.200]  Who would win in a fight?
[05:50.280 --> 05:52.160]  The T-1000 or Mechagodzilla?
[05:52.820 --> 05:55.780]  Oh, you mean a regular-sized robot versus a tiny robot?
[05:56.100 --> 05:56.660]  Dude, I don't know.
[05:57.020 --> 05:57.940]  I don't know, man.
[05:58.020 --> 05:58.700]  He's just metal.
[05:58.780 --> 05:59.800]  He could slip inside.
[05:59.940 --> 06:03.980]  I feel like he could liquid his way up into Mechagodzilla and was Mecha-brained.
[06:04.100 --> 06:05.720]  Maybe he could steal some of them, too.
[06:06.300 --> 06:06.460]  No.
[06:06.460 --> 06:06.880]  Oh!
[06:08.540 --> 06:14.240]  But next, we go to the man who is the reason that we are doing this draft.
[06:14.380 --> 06:15.580]  The robot himself.
[06:16.080 --> 06:16.440]  Andrew.
[06:17.040 --> 06:17.600]  Me.
[06:19.660 --> 06:22.160]  Andrew is now a little robot in our house.
[06:22.280 --> 06:25.180]  It was Gavin's idea, but Andrew is the inspiration for the draft.
[06:25.480 --> 06:25.840]  I am.
[06:26.520 --> 06:26.800]  Yep.
[06:27.020 --> 06:27.940]  Rolling around.
[06:28.560 --> 06:34.620]  I'm going with a robot that is near and dear to my heart, that is from the past,
[06:34.620 --> 06:40.800]  and I think should stay there despite multiple attempts of trying to bring them to modern times.
[06:41.180 --> 06:43.400]  My pick is Bender.
[06:43.980 --> 06:44.660]  I love Bender.
[06:45.100 --> 06:50.260]  One of my great childhood memories is in the summer, going to my grandparents' house
[06:50.260 --> 06:54.540]  and just watching the original run of Futurama with my cousin.
[06:55.060 --> 06:55.760]  Oh, so good.
[06:55.900 --> 07:01.660]  I love that original run and have not been at all moved by anything they've tried to do
[07:01.660 --> 07:02.700]  after that.
[07:02.820 --> 07:08.040]  It feels like an Arrested Development type show where they just keep bringing it back
[07:08.040 --> 07:10.440]  and I'm happy, I guess, for those who enjoy it.
[07:10.580 --> 07:12.220]  But I don't need that.
[07:12.560 --> 07:15.460]  So for you, is it more about the time that it represented in your life?
[07:16.020 --> 07:21.860]  No, I remember loving that show so much the first time I watched it as a kid.
[07:22.340 --> 07:24.540]  And I would watch like two or three episodes a day
[07:25.340 --> 07:27.940]  before we would leave to do errands and stuff.
[07:28.120 --> 07:30.160]  So it's a fond memory.
[07:30.160 --> 07:34.980]  When I think of robots close to my heart, that experience is high.
[07:35.100 --> 07:36.740]  And I just think Bender is a great character.
[07:37.140 --> 07:39.560]  Full name is Bender B. Rodriguez, I believe.
[07:39.800 --> 07:40.400]  That is correct.
[07:40.700 --> 07:40.880]  That's correct.
[07:42.360 --> 07:43.600]  But that's a good pick.
[07:43.700 --> 07:44.820]  I felt like that's a...
[07:45.480 --> 07:46.160]  He was on my list.
[07:46.360 --> 07:46.640]  You took him.
[07:46.740 --> 07:48.860]  It's an early on the list robot pick.
[07:49.040 --> 07:49.620]  It's a good pick.
[07:49.840 --> 07:50.280]  Real good pick.
[07:50.440 --> 07:51.200]  Yeah, really good one.
[07:51.580 --> 07:56.940]  But now come to me and I hope you'll give me some leeway on my robot pick here
[07:56.940 --> 07:58.380]  because I don't know.
[07:58.760 --> 08:02.300]  I don't know how you guys feel about it or whatever.
[08:03.360 --> 08:07.760]  I am going to pick Andrew from Regulation Podcast.
[08:09.080 --> 08:11.500]  My number one pick was also on my list.
[08:12.020 --> 08:18.120]  My number one pick for best robot is a man on this draft.
[08:18.580 --> 08:22.760]  So the inspiration for what we're doing and the reason we're doing it,
[08:22.760 --> 08:29.240]  it's Andrew who has already given us all time moments just in like two or three things that
[08:29.240 --> 08:33.180]  we've all done together being a disgusting little robot.
[08:33.480 --> 08:34.000]  He's heavy.
[08:34.420 --> 08:35.380]  He's dirty.
[08:35.860 --> 08:36.280]  He's great.
[08:36.620 --> 08:39.080]  I'm ready to take on some squirrels is what I am.
[08:39.240 --> 08:41.980]  He's ready to jump off some ledges too.
[08:42.360 --> 08:43.500]  We'll shove him in my ceiling.
[08:43.960 --> 08:45.000]  He's going to get sticky.
[08:45.220 --> 08:46.180]  We're going to put him in the freezer.
[08:46.340 --> 08:47.540]  He's going to start to howl.
[08:47.700 --> 08:50.400]  It's been good so far.
[08:51.640 --> 08:52.700]  Andrew, you're my pick.
[08:52.940 --> 08:56.520]  You need to restick me, I think, because I don't want to get taken by one of the squirrels.
[08:56.560 --> 09:01.440]  We need to make sure I'm strong and I can grip the ground real well because I ain't going up no tree.
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.940]  Could you imagine if we put it up there?
[09:03.960 --> 09:06.840]  It's like, this will be funny and the squirrels just pick him up.
[09:07.120 --> 09:08.940]  It's like when an eagle steals a cell phone.
[09:10.100 --> 09:13.220]  I think maybe we should get an RC Mechagodzilla to protect him.
[09:14.100 --> 09:14.820]  Oh, shit.
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.160]  Smart, smart.
[09:17.160 --> 09:20.080]  Um, but that's my pick is Andrew.
[09:20.200 --> 09:24.280]  And so, uh, Geoff, this is a snake draft, so you actually get two picks in a row.
[09:24.340 --> 09:26.340]  And I know that's that's very exciting for you.
[09:26.440 --> 09:28.280]  Yeah, I never had the opportunity to do that.
[09:28.340 --> 09:32.280]  I'm going to kind of I'm following in your footsteps a little bit, Eric, in that I am
[09:32.280 --> 09:38.520]  also picking a robot that exists in the real world, although I must say he is small on the
[09:38.520 --> 09:40.280]  Mechagodzilla robot scale.
[09:40.400 --> 09:42.320]  He is mighty in accomplishments.
[09:42.820 --> 09:44.660]  He is an overachiever.
[09:44.660 --> 09:46.800]  I'm picking the Mars Rover.
[09:48.760 --> 09:49.960]  I like that.
[09:50.080 --> 09:50.900]  That's a good one.
[09:51.140 --> 09:52.280]  That robot's done some work.
[09:52.800 --> 09:54.360]  He continues to do work.
[09:54.420 --> 09:56.000]  Nobody's asking him to work anymore.
[09:56.420 --> 09:59.480]  We told him he was done years ago and he's like, no, I'm not.
[09:59.900 --> 10:01.640]  You know, you don't get this robot to stop.
[10:01.740 --> 10:03.440]  I'm going to keep transmitting data.
[10:03.580 --> 10:07.960]  And he he does it without fail that that little son of a bitch won't stop.
[10:08.040 --> 10:10.100]  That is a robot after my own heart.
[10:10.160 --> 10:10.920]  Just keeps going.
[10:11.040 --> 10:11.280]  Yeah.
[10:11.280 --> 10:14.760]  Is that the universe's saddest robot where it's saying itself?
[10:14.820 --> 10:15.440]  Happy birthday?
[10:16.060 --> 10:16.280]  Yes.
[10:16.980 --> 10:20.220]  He also he didn't get to work from home during COVID either.
[10:20.540 --> 10:20.860]  Yeah.
[10:20.940 --> 10:22.120]  Well, that's his home now.
[10:22.340 --> 10:22.860]  He lives there.
[10:23.500 --> 10:23.740]  Yeah.
[10:23.900 --> 10:24.120]  Yeah.
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.120]  I think it's after six months you just live there.
[10:26.280 --> 10:29.460]  Why did they program him to sing happy birthday to himself?
[10:29.580 --> 10:31.120]  Like it's so sad.
[10:31.380 --> 10:33.340]  It's so depressing.
[10:34.660 --> 10:40.920]  I get weirdly sad every time I see photos from Mars and it's not as red as I like to
[10:40.920 --> 10:43.800]  imagine it be like the movies make it so red.
[10:43.960 --> 10:45.840]  How red are you imagining Mars?
[10:46.100 --> 10:50.160]  They make it look so red and orange and like any media.
[10:50.520 --> 10:53.240]  And it's just not that vibrant of a color.
[10:53.600 --> 10:55.480]  It's more of like a gray.
[10:55.940 --> 10:58.600]  Were you bummed when you went in the sea and discover the sea isn't that blue?
[10:59.160 --> 11:07.660]  Well, listen, I know that there's a place in Key West, apparently, that it is as can be.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.980]  It ain't here in Texas.
[11:09.980 --> 11:11.540]  Neither am I.
[11:11.660 --> 11:13.080]  So I don't give a fuck about that.
[11:14.660 --> 11:16.660]  Oh, man, you got me there.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.880]  Well, Geoff, great, depressing pick to start.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  But thank you very much.
[11:21.060 --> 11:21.560]  Second.
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.840]  My second pick is a is an interesting robot because he exists in in the world of fiction
[11:27.840 --> 11:28.920]  and reality.
[11:29.380 --> 11:31.640]  He kind of dances between the two.
[11:31.780 --> 11:38.800]  I've been a fan of his since I was about six, 17, 16 or 17, and I still enjoy him
[11:39.360 --> 11:39.900]  weekly.
[11:40.120 --> 11:43.840]  I'm speaking of none other than Crow T-Robot.
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.360]  Oh, that was a very good one.
[11:47.620 --> 11:48.780]  We love Crow.
[11:55.420 --> 11:56.700]  So great.
[11:57.040 --> 11:57.820]  So fun.
[11:58.480 --> 12:03.500]  If you look at him as individual parts, you can just see what he's made out of.
[12:07.340 --> 12:09.880]  Like, as a whole, great for a silhouette.
[12:10.560 --> 12:13.500]  Rough when you just look at a picture of him longer than five seconds.
[12:13.640 --> 12:17.040]  But I think Crow's a fantastic pick for the robot draft.
[12:17.240 --> 12:17.500]  Wow.
[12:18.140 --> 12:19.580]  I didn't it didn't even cross my mind.
[12:19.980 --> 12:21.100]  Didn't even cross my mind.
[12:22.760 --> 12:27.600]  I'm staying in the vein of for my second pick, people that are robots.
[12:28.660 --> 12:32.220]  And I'm going to go with Haley Joel Osment robot from AI.
[12:33.500 --> 12:34.860]  That's a sad robot, too.
[12:36.700 --> 12:39.500]  Haley Joel Osment is a robot in AI.
[12:40.100 --> 12:41.920]  Doesn't really do anything to make him a robot.
[12:42.340 --> 12:46.320]  He's just simply Haley Joel Osment walking around going, it's me.
[12:46.360 --> 12:46.920]  I'm a robot.
[12:47.260 --> 12:48.140]  The whole movie.
[12:48.320 --> 12:53.620]  And then he meets aliens and then he gets a wish because the movie is Pinocchio.
[12:54.100 --> 12:55.120]  And that is what the movie.
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.660]  I think that's what the movie is supposed to be.
[12:56.860 --> 12:58.460]  And then he sinks.
[12:58.460 --> 13:00.960]  And then he cries to see this movie.
[13:01.340 --> 13:03.860]  And he spends 10,000 years rusting underwater.
[13:04.740 --> 13:06.160]  You've never seen that movie?
[13:06.460 --> 13:06.900]  Navasaur.
[13:07.060 --> 13:07.860]  You've never seen AI?
[13:08.420 --> 13:08.660]  Nope.
[13:09.120 --> 13:12.040]  Gavin, I have a rabbit like question to pitch to you here.
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.380]  Are we going to classify androids as robots?
[13:15.840 --> 13:17.280]  That was a question I also had.
[13:17.680 --> 13:18.300]  I would say so.
[13:18.640 --> 13:18.900]  Okay.
[13:19.140 --> 13:21.020]  What is the difference between an android and a robot?
[13:21.360 --> 13:22.180]  I don't know.
[13:22.600 --> 13:22.940]  Words?
[13:23.160 --> 13:23.940]  I was wondering that.
[13:24.200 --> 13:26.520]  I think it's just an android is more human like, right?
[13:26.840 --> 13:28.140]  Yeah, I think it's like a human form.
[13:28.140 --> 13:30.220]  I wasn't sure if there's a thing where like,
[13:31.080 --> 13:33.800]  androids are robots, but not all robots are androids.
[13:33.860 --> 13:34.700]  If it was one of those.
[13:34.980 --> 13:36.180]  Yeah, like toads and frogs.
[13:36.720 --> 13:36.840]  Yeah.
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.480]  I mean, he's a robot.
[13:39.920 --> 13:40.840]  I don't know what to tell you.
[13:41.080 --> 13:43.860]  He's, here he is eating food and it doesn't work.
[13:49.160 --> 13:53.720]  Not that I was disputing it in any way, but that's a great defense by you.
[13:54.060 --> 13:56.660]  I don't, like, I don't know what else to, I don't know what else to tell you.
[13:56.660 --> 13:58.940]  He tries to eat food and it doesn't work.
[13:59.020 --> 14:01.120]  It just gets them all fucked up and gummed up and stuff.
[14:01.200 --> 14:01.680]  He's a robot.
[14:01.940 --> 14:02.800]  I don't want to see this movie anymore.
[14:02.960 --> 14:03.540]  Yeah, I can't.
[14:03.560 --> 14:04.100]  I don't either.
[14:05.520 --> 14:07.060]  That totally turned me off to it.
[14:07.100 --> 14:09.540]  Anyway, question respectfully withdrawn.
[14:10.260 --> 14:10.660]  Okay.
[14:10.840 --> 14:14.340]  I think question mostly just answered and slapped down, but that's fine.
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.060]  Not withdrawn.
[14:15.400 --> 14:17.060]  I haven't made a decision.
[14:17.340 --> 14:17.880]  Point of order.
[14:19.260 --> 14:19.660]  Overruled.
[14:19.960 --> 14:21.180]  I don't know what these words mean.
[14:21.180 --> 14:23.180]  So Haley Joel Osment's my pick.
[14:23.280 --> 14:26.720]  And now we go to Andrew for his choice here on his next robot.
[14:27.020 --> 14:27.520]  Oh, okay.
[14:27.640 --> 14:30.200]  Well, I have a question about robots as well.
[14:30.260 --> 14:31.840]  And what is or isn't a robot?
[14:32.320 --> 14:36.800]  What percentage of robot is required for a thing to be a robot?
[14:37.800 --> 14:38.680]  51 percent.
[14:38.920 --> 14:39.240]  51.
[14:39.380 --> 14:40.560]  Yeah, I was going to say the same.
[14:40.740 --> 14:41.180]  Fuck.
[14:41.320 --> 14:42.380]  So if it's like 50.
[14:42.740 --> 14:42.840]  Oh, that's a great.
[14:43.680 --> 14:48.040]  Okay, well, we need to get in then to the specifics of Robocop.
[14:49.300 --> 14:51.620]  He has a human face.
[14:52.680 --> 14:53.580]  He's a robot.
[14:53.600 --> 14:54.580]  He's a robot.
[14:54.880 --> 14:55.180]  Okay.
[14:55.320 --> 14:56.660]  It's in his fucking name, dude.
[14:56.840 --> 14:57.680]  Have you seen Robocop?
[14:57.740 --> 14:58.540]  Yeah, I have.
[14:59.200 --> 14:59.980]  You look at the letters.
[15:00.640 --> 15:01.400]  You look at the letters.
[15:01.620 --> 15:02.820]  It's more robot than cop.
[15:02.960 --> 15:08.500]  And then also, if you see him all torn apart without the robot shell, he's hardly man.
[15:08.660 --> 15:09.660]  It's just like a head.
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.300]  Especially in the remake.
[15:11.420 --> 15:13.940]  He was like a head with a bag of lungs hanging off it.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.620]  It was like barely anything left.
[15:16.080 --> 15:17.200]  It was really fucked up.
[15:17.200 --> 15:23.460]  I haven't seen the remake, but you saying 51% was terrifying because when I googled it,
[15:23.560 --> 15:24.640]  they said 50%.
[15:25.840 --> 15:27.820]  But it sounds like we all disagree.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.360]  He's definitely not 50%.
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.280]  50% is a useless percentage.
[15:32.440 --> 15:33.740]  It has to be 51 and 49.
[15:33.940 --> 15:36.500]  Yeah, I just I think it's fine.
[15:36.720 --> 15:37.620]  I like there's so many.
[15:37.720 --> 15:39.360]  I think Robocop is such a good pick.
[15:39.480 --> 15:40.560]  And I'm going Robocop.
[15:40.940 --> 15:41.960]  I love Robocop.
[15:42.040 --> 15:43.040]  Also on my list.
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.280]  Yeah, I mean, it's it's so good for the Robo wants Oreo story, which is really good.
[15:48.460 --> 15:50.900]  The lore keeps coming.
[15:51.440 --> 15:58.600]  Yeah, but then also in WCW, when Robocop comes out to help Sting, he saves Sting.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.700]  So that's the world champion.
[16:00.920 --> 16:02.440]  So that's pretty... he's helpful.
[16:02.880 --> 16:03.980]  Here's the thing with Robocop.
[16:04.540 --> 16:07.260]  I think Robocop looks so fucking cool.
[16:07.580 --> 16:13.020]  But if somebody told me they think that he looks dumb as shit, I could also see that.
[16:13.040 --> 16:14.720]  And I wouldn't fight it.
[16:14.860 --> 16:16.660]  He's cool until you see him get out of a car.
[16:17.020 --> 16:19.540]  I don't feel that way in my heart.
[16:19.920 --> 16:21.560]  I think he's just fucking awesome.
[16:21.740 --> 16:23.920]  But it swings both ways.
[16:23.960 --> 16:26.000]  And I would not fight either opinion.
[16:26.320 --> 16:26.560]  Yeah.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.080]  I love Robocop.
[16:29.200 --> 16:29.700]  Great game.
[16:29.840 --> 16:30.800]  Most recent one.
[16:31.140 --> 16:33.000]  It's a polarizing aesthetic for sure.
[16:33.060 --> 16:33.760]  Great movie.
[16:33.900 --> 16:34.320]  Yeah, it is.
[16:34.360 --> 16:35.020]  It definitely is.
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.340]  That is my pick.
[16:36.660 --> 16:37.900]  I think that's a great pick.
[16:37.900 --> 16:44.740]  I think that the 5149 doesn't make any sense because he's definitely way more robot.
[16:45.080 --> 16:46.380]  Yeah, it is.
[16:46.600 --> 16:53.520]  I haven't seen Robocop 3, but I guess they get into the specifics of what in him is still human,
[16:53.700 --> 16:55.860]  which I think is a ridiculous thing.
[16:55.960 --> 17:02.480]  If you've got a titanium plate where your dick used to be, I consider you a robot.
[17:02.640 --> 17:04.480]  Once again, though, he is no Mechagodzilla.
[17:04.760 --> 17:06.660]  So I don't know what any of us are doing.
[17:06.980 --> 17:07.560]  No, no, no.
[17:07.560 --> 17:08.760]  He's actually a very small robot.
[17:08.880 --> 17:10.780]  We're picking a lot of very small robots.
[17:10.820 --> 17:11.760]  This is a little robot.
[17:12.660 --> 17:15.060]  All these robots are so fucking small, dude.
[17:15.600 --> 17:19.300]  Nick, are you picking a big robot, a regular sized robot, or a small robot?
[17:19.740 --> 17:20.920]  I'm sticking small, baby.
[17:21.100 --> 17:26.600]  And these robots used to be untrustworthy in the eyes of one particular character in this series.
[17:26.740 --> 17:31.800]  And this robot slash android proved her wrong.
[17:31.920 --> 17:35.660]  I, of course, am talking about Bishop from Aliens.
[17:35.880 --> 17:37.340]  Oh, great pick.
[17:37.560 --> 17:40.160]  One of my favorite characters of all time.
[17:40.200 --> 17:40.880]  Wow, really?
[17:41.340 --> 17:41.720]  Love him.
[17:42.120 --> 17:45.680]  What is it about Bishop specifically where you're like, hell yeah, this is it?
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.700]  I like that the audience and characters are just viewing him with the same lens of a previous
[17:49.700 --> 17:51.840]  robot that's dead from the first movie.
[17:52.160 --> 17:55.200]  And I think he just walks that line really well where he's like, oh, is he?
[17:55.340 --> 17:55.640]  Isn't he?
[17:55.780 --> 17:57.880]  Oh, and then he saves the day.
[17:58.320 --> 18:01.300]  It's also Lance Hendrickson is awesome in anything he does.
[18:01.600 --> 18:02.440]  He's so good.
[18:02.600 --> 18:04.760]  He's also such a selfless character.
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.400]  There's a bit where he's getting welded into like a one foot diameter pipe.
[18:08.760 --> 18:10.260]  And he's like, oh, what's your fingers?
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.460]  It's like making sure everyone else is all right as he's been stuck in a tiny pipe.
[18:15.300 --> 18:17.460]  Is he the one that does like the knife trick thing?
[18:17.920 --> 18:18.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[18:18.600 --> 18:19.060]  Okay, cool.
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.080]  Yeah, that part's cool.
[18:20.320 --> 18:20.960]  That part's awesome.
[18:21.280 --> 18:23.520]  Yeah, the thing that what's his name didn't know about when it was happening?
[18:25.580 --> 18:26.300]  It's so good.
[18:27.920 --> 18:28.320]  Awesome.
[18:28.760 --> 18:29.920]  Bishop's a really good pick.
[18:30.020 --> 18:31.040]  I really like that.
[18:31.720 --> 18:32.880]  Very, very cool pick.
[18:33.800 --> 18:36.580]  And he's small compared to...
[18:36.740 --> 18:40.040]  According to Gavin and where he lists normal sized robots.
[18:40.580 --> 18:44.900]  Speaking of Gavin, he has our next two picks in the robot draft.
[18:47.460 --> 18:49.260]  Notice you already put your pick up.
[18:49.360 --> 18:50.760]  He's got squirrel problems, everybody.
[18:51.420 --> 18:52.240]  Give him a moment.
[18:52.740 --> 18:53.580]  They've breached.
[18:53.800 --> 18:54.420]  They're inside.
[18:54.580 --> 18:57.880]  They're losing their minds over this potential Mecha Godzilla pick that's coming.
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.900]  Man, I would love to have...
[19:00.900 --> 19:02.720]  I'm so stupid for not including Mecha Godzilla.
[19:03.280 --> 19:04.780]  You can now.
[19:05.300 --> 19:06.720]  Yeah, you have the power.
[19:06.940 --> 19:08.200]  Or you have two picks.
[19:08.820 --> 19:15.540]  I could go for one of my favorite robots from a 1950s film.
[19:16.060 --> 19:19.460]  It's the robot from Forbidden Planet.
[19:19.820 --> 19:20.900]  Oh, I see where this is going.
[19:20.900 --> 19:23.020]  Yeah, I see what you're doing.
[19:23.180 --> 19:24.160]  He's a great little robot.
[19:24.680 --> 19:26.460]  He's got some cool little things on him.
[19:27.320 --> 19:28.480]  Picking up what you're putting down.
[19:28.480 --> 19:28.540]  What?
[19:31.980 --> 19:33.380]  Gavin's got a theme for once.
[19:33.520 --> 19:33.840]  I love it.
[19:36.060 --> 19:37.660]  And he's quite small, isn't he?
[19:37.760 --> 19:41.060]  Do you think everyone's going to get mad at him like the way they get mad at you, Geoff?
[19:41.140 --> 19:42.060]  Or do you think it's going to be okay?
[19:42.320 --> 19:45.600]  Dude, I get so fucking crucified when I do this.
[19:45.780 --> 19:48.300]  If Gavin gets away scot-free, I'm going to be really annoyed.
[19:53.620 --> 19:57.640]  I haven't seen either of the stories relating to these robots.
[19:58.780 --> 20:02.660]  Are they supposed to be like modern inventions?
[20:02.900 --> 20:06.600]  Because they're so bulky and unnecessarily large.
[20:06.740 --> 20:09.580]  Although small on the mecha scale, as I know.
[20:09.780 --> 20:15.520]  But they just don't seem user-friendly or convenient in any way with how they're designed.
[20:15.800 --> 20:16.880]  That's the robot of the future.
[20:17.440 --> 20:22.340]  Well, you have to think too, like in the 1950s and 60s when this was made,
[20:22.400 --> 20:24.540]  a computer was the size of a building.
[20:25.180 --> 20:25.380]  Sure.
[20:25.560 --> 20:28.100]  So this was their idea of tiny.
[20:28.480 --> 20:32.140]  I feel like every robot in Fallout was inspired by this robot.
[20:32.300 --> 20:33.560]  Oh, absolutely.
[20:35.080 --> 20:38.580]  I've destroyed that specific robot a million times.
[20:41.480 --> 20:42.560]  No hesitation.
[20:44.160 --> 20:48.720]  Well, you know, two is true, but let's see if three is a pattern
[20:48.720 --> 20:50.640]  because the next pick is Gavin again.
[20:50.840 --> 20:52.660]  And let's see what he picks here for his next robot.
[20:54.740 --> 20:55.840]  Interesting you ask.
[20:55.840 --> 20:56.800]  I'm going to go...
[20:56.800 --> 20:58.500]  Not that interesting.
[21:00.700 --> 21:02.540]  This is the order in which this goes.
[21:02.560 --> 21:03.500]  Kind of expected.
[21:03.900 --> 21:05.660]  Pre-expected and normal that you asked.
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.180]  But this time I'm going to go for a...
[21:07.660 --> 21:08.760]  It's quite a small robot.
[21:08.860 --> 21:10.680]  It's slightly taller than the man in the picture.
[21:11.300 --> 21:13.900]  It's the robot from Columbo.
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.000]  It's a great robot.
[21:17.200 --> 21:18.580]  He talks to the robot.
[21:18.680 --> 21:20.720]  He's asking the robot stuff about murders.
[21:21.220 --> 21:22.340]  The robot's filling him in.
[21:22.780 --> 21:23.600]  Phenomenal robot.
[21:24.140 --> 21:24.400]  Great.
[21:24.780 --> 21:25.020]  Great.
[21:25.020 --> 21:27.780]  This is a Steven Spielberg draft.
[21:29.680 --> 21:31.600]  This is ridiculous.
[21:31.960 --> 21:32.860]  Oh my god.
[21:33.740 --> 21:36.960]  I like that his ear is like one up, one to the side.
[21:37.980 --> 21:38.680]  Oh man.
[21:38.880 --> 21:40.440]  In everything he's in.
[21:40.740 --> 21:41.600]  Every iteration.
[21:46.310 --> 21:49.570]  What's going on with Columbo's posture in this?
[21:49.690 --> 21:50.530]  He's intrigued.
[21:51.270 --> 21:51.990]  He's Columbo.
[21:52.770 --> 21:53.790]  He's intrigued by the robot.
[21:54.390 --> 21:55.230]  I mean, so would I.
[21:56.630 --> 21:58.870]  But he looks kind of huddled up.
[21:59.530 --> 22:03.770]  He looks thicker than I think of Columbo, typically.
[22:04.810 --> 22:06.590]  I think it's an interesting pose.
[22:07.150 --> 22:07.170]  Thicker?
[22:07.590 --> 22:09.330]  It might just be the way the jacket's hanging.
[22:09.870 --> 22:10.390]  I don't know.
[22:10.530 --> 22:12.870]  I can't articulate exactly what I'm seeing here.
[22:12.950 --> 22:15.750]  But that is not a pose I've seen Columbo in, typically.
[22:16.230 --> 22:17.950]  He was always a bit of a gremlin, I feel.
[22:18.030 --> 22:19.510]  Yeah, I feel like he's hunched quite a lot.
[22:19.610 --> 22:20.210]  He's always like...
[22:20.210 --> 22:20.550]  You know what?
[22:20.810 --> 22:22.710]  He definitely is, yeah.
[22:22.930 --> 22:24.190]  Well, he's just asking the robot one...
[22:24.190 --> 22:24.850]  Just one more thing.
[22:25.410 --> 22:26.650]  He's also with a robot.
[22:26.850 --> 22:27.650]  When have you seen that?
[22:28.010 --> 22:28.610]  Yeah, that's true.
[22:28.770 --> 22:30.030]  That's also very true.
[22:30.270 --> 22:30.550]  Yeah.
[22:30.990 --> 22:32.990]  I mean, Columbo's typically talking to people.
[22:33.470 --> 22:36.870]  And maybe he's just mystified by how small this robot is.
[22:38.650 --> 22:40.710]  Alexa, order a coffee!
[22:40.950 --> 22:42.830]  Like, he's just yelling commands at it.
[22:42.870 --> 22:44.210]  He doesn't know how this works.
[22:44.970 --> 22:46.210]  Columbo using Alexa?
[22:46.430 --> 22:48.810]  We need to bring back Funny or Die just so we can make that.
[22:50.270 --> 22:52.630]  It could be for Old Spice or something.
[22:52.630 --> 22:55.450]  And they could pay everyone, like, less than union wages.
[22:55.570 --> 22:56.090]  That's exciting.
[22:56.550 --> 23:00.170]  I would definitely use Alexa, though, if it was in that, in the corner of the kitchen.
[23:00.890 --> 23:02.550]  Sounds like you have some 3D printing to do.
[23:03.890 --> 23:05.770]  Put Andrew's head on that thing and you got it.
[23:06.970 --> 23:10.750]  Well, Nick, you've seen what Gavin's picked so far.
[23:11.010 --> 23:13.110]  It's now your third pick in the robot draft.
[23:14.250 --> 23:18.570]  Ooh, Gavin mentioned Fallout, which got me thinking about a certain character that I
[23:18.570 --> 23:19.570]  actually found very interesting.
[23:19.570 --> 23:23.950]  I know Fallout 4 kind of divided fanbase on how they felt about it.
[23:23.970 --> 23:24.530]  I love the game.
[23:24.690 --> 23:24.810]  Yeah.
[23:24.910 --> 23:28.890]  So I'm going to go with one partner in that game, Nick Valentine.
[23:29.290 --> 23:29.610]  I knew it.
[23:29.950 --> 23:30.790]  I knew it.
[23:31.070 --> 23:34.510]  Who is an old private eye, old world detective kind of dude.
[23:34.570 --> 23:37.150]  And he even has a cool quest line where you can go and solve all that stuff.
[23:37.190 --> 23:40.530]  But he's also just an interesting character since, you know, you have to deal with all
[23:40.530 --> 23:42.230]  the synths throughout that game anyway.
[23:42.330 --> 23:42.950]  And he is one.
[23:43.270 --> 23:44.830]  So how does he play in this world?
[23:44.890 --> 23:45.430]  He's a great pick.
[23:45.730 --> 23:49.010]  He's probably the companion that I used the most when I played the game.
[23:49.010 --> 23:49.570]  Definitely.
[23:49.910 --> 23:50.130]  Same.
[23:50.450 --> 23:50.610]  Yeah.
[23:50.770 --> 23:50.970]  Yeah.
[23:51.610 --> 23:57.050]  He was the most interesting character in a game full of less than interesting characters.
[23:57.570 --> 23:58.630]  I like the reporter.
[23:59.330 --> 24:00.670]  Yeah, right, right.
[24:00.790 --> 24:04.570]  We're, we're cherry picking things that were interesting in the game that was sort of bland,
[24:04.670 --> 24:05.590]  I think is what I'm saying.
[24:07.070 --> 24:07.750]  I like him.
[24:09.590 --> 24:10.290]  It's fun.
[24:10.490 --> 24:13.710]  Well, Nick Valentine, very, very good pick.
[24:13.790 --> 24:18.370]  A very small robot compared to a regular sized robot.
[24:18.370 --> 24:19.750]  Same name as you, Nick.
[24:20.110 --> 24:20.970]  I know, I like it more.
[24:22.310 --> 24:23.030]  Very interesting.
[24:23.550 --> 24:23.910]  Right?
[24:24.670 --> 24:27.770]  A draft of just Nick robots would have been really interesting if you could make a draft
[24:27.770 --> 24:28.170]  out of that.
[24:28.570 --> 24:29.070]  Nick draft.
[24:29.290 --> 24:29.490]  Yeah.
[24:29.870 --> 24:30.290]  Robot Nick.
[24:32.150 --> 24:32.870]  Robot Nick!
[24:34.150 --> 24:34.870]  Nick draft.
[24:35.050 --> 24:35.990]  I'm putting it, I'm writing it down.
[24:36.070 --> 24:36.710]  Yeah, write it down.
[24:36.850 --> 24:37.690]  Write down Nick draft.
[24:37.830 --> 24:38.650]  That's a really good idea.
[24:38.970 --> 24:39.490]  I like it.
[24:39.850 --> 24:42.910]  Andrew, you are the titular robot in this robot draft.
[24:42.990 --> 24:43.830]  So what's your next pick?
[24:43.830 --> 24:49.110]  Nick Valentine is an interesting one because we're going to do a sidekicks draft and he was
[24:49.110 --> 24:50.930]  on my list for sidekicks.
[24:51.030 --> 24:51.550]  Wow.
[24:51.550 --> 24:54.370]  So that pulls him from that.
[24:55.350 --> 24:58.990]  But I am going with, once again, we talked about Robocop.
[24:59.510 --> 25:00.150]  It's in the name.
[25:00.610 --> 25:04.090]  To me, an iconic robot that is not in the name.
[25:04.390 --> 25:05.430]  It's actually quite the opposite.
[25:06.010 --> 25:07.650]  I am drafting Mega Man.
[25:08.330 --> 25:10.150]  Love me some Mega Man.
[25:10.810 --> 25:12.810]  He's got a blaster for an arm.
[25:12.910 --> 25:13.410]  He goes around.
[25:13.410 --> 25:14.370]  He fights bosses.
[25:14.890 --> 25:18.450]  Those are such fun games that they'll never bring back because people don't want them.
[25:18.650 --> 25:21.450]  But I really enjoyed all those games.
[25:21.790 --> 25:22.990]  So that's not a man in a suit.
[25:23.390 --> 25:24.190]  No, robot.
[25:25.030 --> 25:27.310]  Mega Man's a full robot all the way.
[25:27.470 --> 25:27.910]  That's crazy.
[25:28.010 --> 25:28.670]  I didn't know that.
[25:28.850 --> 25:29.750]  Yeah, I thought he was a cyborg.
[25:29.970 --> 25:32.830]  No, he's there's no human part of Mega Man.
[25:32.890 --> 25:34.170]  He's fully a robot.
[25:34.730 --> 25:35.430]  What about OK?
[25:35.530 --> 25:36.370]  What about his face?
[25:36.910 --> 25:37.470]  It's human looking.
[25:38.050 --> 25:40.870]  OK, and got you made him look like that.
[25:40.870 --> 25:41.630]  Hmm.
[25:42.070 --> 25:43.730]  Oh, all right.
[25:44.190 --> 25:46.270]  I respectfully withdraw my question.
[25:46.350 --> 25:48.070]  Stop respectfully withdrawing your questions.
[25:48.170 --> 25:48.830]  What do you think?
[25:49.310 --> 25:51.530]  Do you think Rush is an actual dog?
[25:52.150 --> 25:52.650]  It's a band.
[25:53.030 --> 25:53.430]  OK.
[25:55.930 --> 25:59.070]  My question is disrespectfully withdrawn.
[25:59.770 --> 26:01.270]  That dog sang Tom Sawyer.
[26:04.090 --> 26:05.390]  Spirit of the radio, baby.
[26:05.730 --> 26:07.510]  I think Mega Man's a great pick.
[26:07.670 --> 26:09.650]  I don't know if they're going to make any more of those games.
[26:09.650 --> 26:12.950]  I think the last one that they made was like sort of like medium received.
[26:13.950 --> 26:16.710]  And I guess that kind of goes into my next pick also,
[26:17.470 --> 26:21.030]  because my next pick is Michael Fassbender robot from Prometheus.
[26:21.390 --> 26:25.830]  And I don't I don't anticipate them making any more Prometheus-esque
[26:25.830 --> 26:28.390]  movies after Rhombus or whatever.
[26:29.050 --> 26:29.950]  David, David.
[26:30.330 --> 26:31.470]  His name is David.
[26:31.570 --> 26:32.790]  Yes, he'll do the thing.
[26:32.890 --> 26:35.570]  And also, yeah, he's creepy as shit.
[26:37.370 --> 26:38.750]  So that's my pick.
[26:38.750 --> 26:42.250]  Michael Fassbender, I think, is a great actor that should be in more stuff,
[26:42.490 --> 26:43.750]  especially after Black Bag.
[26:44.150 --> 26:45.190]  Put that guy in more things.
[26:45.510 --> 26:48.310]  I think he probably had kids and then he went, I don't want to do this right now.
[26:48.490 --> 26:52.270]  And now is the time for him to come back as the robot and answer
[26:52.710 --> 26:55.030]  all the questions we had left over from Prometheus.
[26:55.150 --> 26:56.290]  Like, what's going on?
[26:56.730 --> 26:57.630]  Where are you going?
[26:58.030 --> 26:59.090]  What is this?
[26:59.210 --> 27:00.230]  And many others.
[27:00.610 --> 27:02.070]  You mean Alien Covenant didn't do that?
[27:03.450 --> 27:07.910]  Prometheus is a weird movie because it follows like what Alien did almost like beat for beat.
[27:07.910 --> 27:10.430]  And then just goes in like a different direction.
[27:10.450 --> 27:10.970]  Kind of.
[27:11.050 --> 27:11.450]  I don't know.
[27:11.670 --> 27:13.070]  It's like, I just don't know why they made it.
[27:13.170 --> 27:14.250]  I don't know why they made Prometheus.
[27:14.750 --> 27:15.430]  Got a squid.
[27:16.010 --> 27:17.350]  Got a big old alien squid.
[27:18.930 --> 27:20.430]  That's all I think about with Prometheus.
[27:20.930 --> 27:22.770]  I think about when the guy dissolves.
[27:23.090 --> 27:24.450]  He drinks the stuff.
[27:24.570 --> 27:26.430]  He dissolves into the water.
[27:26.710 --> 27:28.070]  Yeah, it's the most interesting part of the movie.
[27:28.130 --> 27:29.230]  It happens like right at the beginning.
[27:29.290 --> 27:30.270]  You go, what is this?
[27:30.290 --> 27:32.170]  And then it's like, yeah, don't worry about this.
[27:32.250 --> 27:35.370]  I like when the old guy's like, what's the meaning of us?
[27:35.370 --> 27:39.990]  And the robot's like, yeah, he just like fucking picks him up.
[27:40.090 --> 27:40.690]  Fuck you.
[27:40.770 --> 27:42.330]  It's like, how dare you talk to me?
[27:43.530 --> 27:45.210]  Is that how you make cress, Gavin?
[27:46.250 --> 27:48.290]  Some person drinking, dissolving.
[27:48.390 --> 27:48.550]  Yep.
[27:48.910 --> 27:49.750]  Dissolving into the water.
[27:50.970 --> 27:52.890]  Geoff, you're at the end.
[27:53.030 --> 27:54.870]  So Snake rules.
[27:55.030 --> 27:57.190]  You get three and you get four.
[27:57.330 --> 28:00.130]  This is your final two picks for the robot draft.
[28:00.390 --> 28:02.530]  This is exciting for me for a couple of reasons.
[28:02.570 --> 28:04.550]  One, I'm really excited about my third pick.
[28:04.550 --> 28:07.310]  But two, I don't know what my fourth pick is yet.
[28:07.370 --> 28:08.050]  I haven't decided.
[28:08.210 --> 28:11.990]  So future Geoff is going to figure that out in about, I don't know, 45 seconds.
[28:13.410 --> 28:18.770]  For my third pick, I'm excited to go with a robot that is near and dear to my heart.
[28:18.890 --> 28:24.650]  It's one of the few robots that I have owned and used throughout my adulthood.
[28:24.810 --> 28:29.490]  It's also a robot that has appeared in content and done very well for Gavin and I.
[28:29.530 --> 28:33.130]  I am speaking, of course, of the Roomba.
[28:35.070 --> 28:35.870]  Classic robot.
[28:36.030 --> 28:36.830]  So many iterations.
[28:37.270 --> 28:37.650]  Yeah.
[28:37.910 --> 28:38.190]  Yeah.
[28:38.270 --> 28:39.410]  That's a really great one.
[28:39.730 --> 28:41.190]  That's so many iterations.
[28:41.630 --> 28:42.890]  Yeah, especially with the knives too.
[28:43.730 --> 28:44.890]  Do you guys like doing that?
[28:44.930 --> 28:46.390]  Do you guys like the knife Roomba thing?
[28:46.570 --> 28:48.050]  Like you feel like that's something we should...
[28:48.050 --> 28:48.850]  Should we do that with Andrew?
[28:49.590 --> 28:51.750]  Yeah, I want a knife attached to me.
[28:51.970 --> 28:55.810]  You put a knife on Andrew and you have him chase down a Roomba to see if he can do it?
[28:56.130 --> 28:58.790]  Maybe we should all wear some metal ankle guards.
[28:59.330 --> 28:59.510]  No.
[28:59.510 --> 29:00.070]  No kidding.
[29:00.430 --> 29:00.970]  Oh yeah.
[29:01.090 --> 29:02.810]  Why did you say no?
[29:02.810 --> 29:07.810]  Okay, in my defense, in my defense, this is what happened.
[29:07.910 --> 29:12.790]  Okay, we were all talking about attaching a knife to me and running around catching people.
[29:13.050 --> 29:16.690]  And then Gavin brought up ankle guards like I would target you guys.
[29:16.770 --> 29:19.550]  And that my brain went that like that was the content idea.
[29:19.770 --> 29:23.910]  I'm now seeing that it's just like a helmet, like a protection type thing.
[29:24.350 --> 29:28.670]  You guys are all wearing protection for when I potentially accidentally go rogue.
[29:28.850 --> 29:29.690]  I misunderstood.
[29:29.990 --> 29:31.410]  I thought Gavin was pitching.
[29:31.410 --> 29:33.730]  You view ankle guards as a helmet?
[29:34.530 --> 29:35.590]  Well, it's protection.
[29:35.850 --> 29:37.490]  That's the point I was articulating.
[29:37.710 --> 29:40.110]  You know, Spartan helmet, as we went over recently.
[29:41.470 --> 29:42.510]  Spartan anklets.
[29:43.590 --> 29:44.510]  Keep them safe.
[29:44.910 --> 29:46.090]  Jesus Christ.
[29:46.690 --> 29:49.770]  I thought Gavin was pitching that I chase after you guys with a knife.
[29:49.890 --> 29:51.210]  That's why I said no immediately.
[29:51.770 --> 29:56.550]  But I was also thinking about that I don't want a knife when I go see the squirrels
[29:56.550 --> 30:00.950]  because I would feel so bad to accidentally knife one of those little guys.
[30:00.950 --> 30:03.790]  Little menaces up there.
[30:04.990 --> 30:05.910]  No knives.
[30:06.370 --> 30:08.170]  All except actually, there will be knives.
[30:08.410 --> 30:10.750]  But no attacking with the knives.
[30:12.330 --> 30:14.990]  Well, no, but yes, I'm great.
[30:16.510 --> 30:19.330]  I'm as good as one can be that's smaller than Mechagodzilla.
[30:20.350 --> 30:24.390]  For my fourth pick, the first three robots I picked were
[30:24.390 --> 30:27.330]  kind of grounded in reality and robots that kind of exist.
[30:27.330 --> 30:34.270]  But I decided for the fourth pick that instead of trying to follow along that thought line,
[30:34.910 --> 30:39.790]  I would pick something, an enjoyable robot that I like from popular culture and from media.
[30:40.310 --> 30:43.250]  And so I'm going to go with a bit of a bad guy,
[30:43.390 --> 30:46.010]  but just a delightful robot to interact with.
[30:46.150 --> 30:50.810]  And one of the best villains in a video game, I think I've experienced.
[30:50.930 --> 30:51.770]  I'm going to go with GLaDOS.
[30:52.870 --> 30:54.910]  Yeah, that was on my list.
[30:55.130 --> 30:56.170]  That's a great pick.
[30:56.170 --> 30:57.450]  Yeah, terrifying.
[30:57.630 --> 30:58.850]  Completely would have been a good pick.
[30:59.110 --> 30:59.310]  Damn it.
[31:00.190 --> 31:02.030]  Well, you still have a pick.
[31:02.050 --> 31:03.010]  Oh, if only there was still time.
[31:03.930 --> 31:07.390]  You seem upset like everything's passed.
[31:07.790 --> 31:09.150]  You keep going, I should have picked that.
[31:09.270 --> 31:10.690]  And you have more...
[31:10.690 --> 31:11.110]  A pick.
[31:11.190 --> 31:12.130]  You can still pick.
[31:12.390 --> 31:13.870]  Nah, trust me, everything's passed.
[31:16.810 --> 31:17.330]  Locked in.
[31:18.830 --> 31:20.810]  Trust me, it's nuts.
[31:24.250 --> 31:26.050]  I think GLaDOS is a great pick.
[31:26.970 --> 31:28.490]  We go to my last pick.
[31:28.730 --> 31:32.650]  And again, I'm going to ask for some leeway, see if you guys will allow this.
[31:33.050 --> 31:36.530]  Really, really, there's no way I'm probably going to back down from this,
[31:36.530 --> 31:38.650]  because I think, you know, I'm right.
[31:39.210 --> 31:42.090]  I'm going to go with Harrison Ford Robot and Blade Runner.
[31:42.890 --> 31:43.090]  Yeah.
[31:43.930 --> 31:44.670]  Yeah, that's fine.
[31:45.150 --> 31:45.630]  Yeah, that's fine.
[31:45.690 --> 31:46.430]  He's a replicant.
[31:46.570 --> 31:47.470]  He's a replicant.
[31:47.810 --> 31:47.990]  Yeah.
[31:48.450 --> 31:50.350]  I think that's heavily inferred.
[31:50.630 --> 31:53.070]  If you have a problem with that, argue in the comments, guys.
[31:53.630 --> 31:54.050]  That's true.
[31:54.230 --> 31:55.790]  He had a baby, though.
[31:57.030 --> 31:58.630]  Didn't they undo that in the second movie?
[32:01.970 --> 32:04.570]  Wasn't the whole second movie about he had a kid.
[32:05.010 --> 32:06.310]  I meant him being a robot.
[32:06.970 --> 32:08.150]  I didn't see the second one.
[32:09.370 --> 32:10.950]  No, he's still a robot.
[32:12.130 --> 32:13.330]  Okay, all right.
[32:13.930 --> 32:14.830]  I didn't see the second one either.
[32:15.350 --> 32:16.270]  Wait, you didn't see the second one?
[32:17.270 --> 32:20.490]  Wait, hang on.
[32:20.570 --> 32:21.030]  Hang on, hang on.
[32:21.130 --> 32:22.550]  Nick, you didn't see the second one?
[32:23.270 --> 32:23.530]  No.
[32:23.530 --> 32:26.130]  Okay, but how do you feel about Minority Report?
[32:28.430 --> 32:30.670]  It's giving opinions to things we hadn't seen.
[32:31.570 --> 32:34.310]  It's been confirmed by Ridley Scott that he's a replicant.
[32:34.550 --> 32:39.750]  So wait, Nick was like, yeah, man, they undid that.
[32:40.490 --> 32:42.390]  I've heard rumors on the streets.
[32:43.070 --> 32:45.890]  Yeah, yeah, I heard rumors on Wikipedia that I might have...
[32:46.590 --> 32:47.830]  Well, no, I didn't read the article.
[32:47.970 --> 32:48.330]  Never mind.
[32:49.050 --> 32:51.430]  Nick is how misinformation starts.
[32:54.090 --> 32:54.970]  Yeah, put it.
[32:55.030 --> 32:55.730]  Whatever, I don't care.
[32:56.450 --> 32:56.850]  Phenomenal.
[32:57.150 --> 32:58.430]  I need to see the sequel.
[32:58.850 --> 32:59.330]  That was wild.
[33:00.550 --> 33:02.330]  Nick, that was really crazy.
[33:03.290 --> 33:05.170]  That's some wild takes today in this draft.
[33:08.280 --> 33:09.400]  There's a good one, man.
[33:09.740 --> 33:10.840]  I'm impressed with you.
[33:11.240 --> 33:12.440]  I'm really impressed with you.
[33:12.940 --> 33:14.160]  Can this be behind the paywall?
[33:14.340 --> 33:18.000]  I'm generally not a fan of misinformation being spread, but I'm all for this.
[33:18.040 --> 33:19.860]  If we just want to make this a thing, then he's not.
[33:20.520 --> 33:21.940]  I'm pretty into this idea.
[33:22.420 --> 33:27.640]  Nick News is very interesting to me, where it's just some stuff that he heard or read one time,
[33:27.740 --> 33:30.280]  but he doesn't really know what it's from or what it's about.
[33:30.540 --> 33:34.860]  What if we did like a series where it's predict a movie sequel badly?
[33:35.280 --> 33:39.620]  I mean, I don't know what the series is, but a series called Nick News has to happen.
[33:39.960 --> 33:40.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:41.440 --> 33:43.720]  Just by the desk, guessing the news.
[33:45.240 --> 33:46.680]  Hey, what do you think this is about?
[33:46.940 --> 33:50.460]  We throw a date at him and he has to guess the news in his news anchor suit.
[33:50.460 --> 33:53.180]  It's like, all right, May 17th, 2029.
[33:53.460 --> 33:53.580]  Go.
[33:53.860 --> 33:57.920]  Maybe we just like spin by a bunch of tweets and headlines without any of the full context
[33:57.920 --> 34:00.200]  and he has to like get the news from it.
[34:00.440 --> 34:01.160]  That's the news.
[34:01.580 --> 34:01.700]  Yeah.
[34:01.960 --> 34:03.520]  Today, Balloon Boy's back.
[34:06.040 --> 34:09.180]  2029, Balloon Boy returns and he's in the balloon again.
[34:09.300 --> 34:09.900]  That's awesome.
[34:10.060 --> 34:11.500]  But for real this time.
[34:11.520 --> 34:12.520]  Right, that's what happened.
[34:12.940 --> 34:14.900]  Well, that's my fourth and final pick.
[34:15.320 --> 34:18.280]  And Andrew is down to his last pick as a robot himself.
[34:19.820 --> 34:23.360]  I don't know if I'll get pushback on this pick, much like Eric.
[34:24.040 --> 34:27.840]  I think this may be one of the great underappreciated robots.
[34:27.980 --> 34:31.020]  It's the thing that I don't think many consider to be robot.
[34:31.440 --> 34:36.060]  If you guys say it's not a robot, I guess I'm fine with that.
[34:36.100 --> 34:41.620]  But I I'm drafting vending machines, vending machines anywhere.
[34:45.680 --> 34:47.080]  Is that not a robot?
[34:47.080 --> 34:50.380]  If a Roomba is a robot, how is a vending machine not a robot?
[34:51.180 --> 34:52.820]  Well, it's in the name. It's a machine.
[34:54.240 --> 34:56.500]  Oh, a Roomba is a machine.
[34:56.840 --> 34:59.060]  A Roomba is called a vacuum cleaning robot.
[34:59.420 --> 35:00.720]  They're automated machines.
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.600]  All robots are machines, but not all machines are robots.
[35:04.060 --> 35:04.340]  Damn.
[35:05.120 --> 35:05.480]  Okay.
[35:06.020 --> 35:09.300]  I think we have to I think we have to take a vote on.
[35:09.480 --> 35:10.460]  I mean, it's mechanical.
[35:11.260 --> 35:13.260]  It's yeah, this is why I think we need to take a vote.
[35:13.400 --> 35:14.240]  So is a toaster.
[35:14.420 --> 35:16.440]  It's less human than RoboCop.
[35:17.080 --> 35:17.860]  Hold on.
[35:18.180 --> 35:20.240]  But a car is mechanical. It's not a robot.
[35:20.280 --> 35:21.400]  Yeah, a toaster is mechanical.
[35:21.820 --> 35:24.600]  Okay, so Andrew, what if you what about that?
[35:26.960 --> 35:29.120]  That is definitely a vending machine robot.
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.300]  If somebody told me that their toaster is a robot, I don't think I'd push back on that.
[35:34.300 --> 35:36.860]  That's fucking you're an insane person.
[35:37.080 --> 35:42.540]  You think you think if on the podcast Gavin said that his toaster was a robot,
[35:42.680 --> 35:44.020]  you would just let that slide?
[35:44.260 --> 35:45.400]  Yeah, I definitely would.
[35:45.400 --> 35:47.700]  But there's no autonomy in a toaster.
[35:48.880 --> 35:52.140]  Is autonomy a necessary part of a robot?
[35:52.580 --> 35:55.280]  Well, I don't know, like a like a Roomba just kind of sees shit.
[35:55.440 --> 35:58.260]  It goes about based on its programming.
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.820]  That's I feel like function versus.
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.520]  Okay, so let's let's take a vote.
[36:03.720 --> 36:05.240]  Andrew, is a vending machine a robot?
[36:05.700 --> 36:06.260]  Yes or no.
[36:06.580 --> 36:08.840]  Okay, Gavin, is a vending machine a robot?
[36:09.460 --> 36:10.660]  Almost certainly not.
[36:11.060 --> 36:13.080]  Okay, I'm gonna vote yes.
[36:13.080 --> 36:16.980]  Um, Geoff, is a vending machine a robot?
[36:17.640 --> 36:18.840]  Not even close.
[36:18.960 --> 36:23.320]  Okay, and now we leave it up to Nick to really make the decision here about
[36:23.320 --> 36:25.420]  if Andrew can have vending machine on this list.
[36:25.860 --> 36:29.360]  Do I want to overcome the replicant thing?
[36:30.620 --> 36:32.540]  I'm afraid no, it's not.
[36:33.440 --> 36:36.460]  Andrew, we took a vote. I was on your side, buddy.
[36:36.940 --> 36:40.820]  Unfortunately, vending machine not going to count as a robot.
[36:41.020 --> 36:42.660]  So you're going to have to make another pick.
[36:42.660 --> 36:46.400]  Also, it's not a fucking robot. You're insane.
[36:46.780 --> 36:51.200]  I googled it. It said Google says while vending machines are automated,
[36:51.220 --> 36:54.840]  they are not generally considered robots because I guess they're not autonomous
[36:54.840 --> 36:58.840]  and they can't do complex tasks like interact with their environment.
[36:59.120 --> 37:00.000]  What about a crane game?
[37:00.340 --> 37:03.600]  I would also say that the machine that goes wrong the most in my life.
[37:04.640 --> 37:06.040]  Really, a vending machine?
[37:06.140 --> 37:09.400]  I have bad vending machine luck. I'm always getting gummed up in them.
[37:10.080 --> 37:10.480]  Huh.
[37:11.400 --> 37:13.280]  You're not supposed to put anything in it.
[37:13.320 --> 37:14.420]  You put money in it.
[37:14.440 --> 37:15.480]  Well, I'm putting gum in it.
[37:15.960 --> 37:19.580]  Gavin's like Homer Simpson. He's got his arms stuck in there because he doesn't want to let go of the can.
[37:19.860 --> 37:23.380]  Yep. All right. So, Andrew, vending machine is out. What you got?
[37:25.940 --> 37:29.940]  You know what? I'm sick of all these tiny robots.
[37:30.100 --> 37:36.780]  I'm going with an appropriately sized average standard baseline we can all measure off of.
[37:37.480 --> 37:37.880]  Mechagodzilla.
[37:39.300 --> 37:39.840]  Mechagodzilla!
[37:41.140 --> 37:41.680]  Incredible.
[37:43.100 --> 37:47.740]  That's... he's finally a regular sized robot around here.
[37:47.940 --> 37:50.660]  I... you know what? I think it's important to recognize that.
[37:51.180 --> 37:55.700]  I was not a fan that they tried to make him not a robot in the sequel.
[37:56.080 --> 38:01.740]  I was very upset about that. But outside of that, no complaints about Mechagodzilla.
[38:02.200 --> 38:03.700]  Everyone's... everyone's good with Mechagodzilla?
[38:04.040 --> 38:04.660]  Yeah. Good with it.
[38:05.020 --> 38:05.720]  Just making sure.
[38:05.860 --> 38:07.360]  Oh, I mean, it's a robot, so definitely.
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.460]  I don't know who said it's in the name. I also drafted Mega Man.
[38:12.760 --> 38:19.160]  I just want to point out how dumb that was as a counter to why a vending machine isn't a robot.
[38:19.180 --> 38:21.380]  Well, it's not called a vending robot. It's called a vending machine.
[38:21.660 --> 38:24.120]  It's true. That's true.
[38:25.040 --> 38:28.980]  My point is I drafted something with man in the title.
[38:29.700 --> 38:30.880]  Yeah, but he's not a man.
[38:31.020 --> 38:31.180]  Yeah.
[38:31.420 --> 38:32.780]  That's my point.
[38:33.800 --> 38:34.140]  Wait, what?
[38:34.140 --> 38:35.100]  Okay, but that's... what?
[38:37.600 --> 38:38.000]  Overruled!
[38:40.220 --> 38:44.800]  Point of order. It's Nick's turn now. Nick, you get your final robot pick here.
[38:45.120 --> 38:46.720]  You know, nostalgia is important.
[38:47.220 --> 38:48.040]  And, uh...
[38:48.040 --> 38:49.140]  Yeah, look at Gavin's.
[38:49.600 --> 38:53.700]  Yeah, look at... yeah, look at where Gavin's going to go. And I could block him, but I won't.
[38:54.300 --> 38:54.700]  So...
[38:54.700 --> 38:55.680]  You don't know where I'm going.
[38:57.320 --> 38:58.820]  Well, now I kind of want to guess.
[39:00.940 --> 39:02.100]  No, but I...
[39:02.100 --> 39:04.120]  I'm thinking back to the...
[39:04.120 --> 39:11.600]  After school's over, you come home, you flip on the TV, and there to greet you is Tom the Toonami
[39:12.340 --> 39:12.780]  robot.
[39:13.040 --> 39:15.000]  Oh, Tom from Toonami.
[39:15.620 --> 39:16.180]  He's a robot.
[39:16.680 --> 39:17.360]  Bloom? Bloom?
[39:17.940 --> 39:20.100]  Yeah, do you guys not remember this?
[39:20.380 --> 39:21.740]  Don't know that robot. No.
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.480]  Let's play with him, but he seems like a robot.
[39:23.960 --> 39:25.040]  I got the American vote.
[39:25.360 --> 39:29.500]  Yeah, no, I'm with you. It's good. The one that I remember more was this guy.
[39:29.920 --> 39:33.280]  It's the same guy, but it's before they changed his look or whatever.
[39:33.280 --> 39:34.440]  And he's like an old idiot.
[39:34.980 --> 39:35.880]  Now that's a little robot.
[39:36.300 --> 39:37.220]  Yeah, that's...
[39:37.220 --> 39:39.120]  I think to me he's a little robot.
[39:39.460 --> 39:40.140]  Yeah, that's Tom.
[39:40.140 --> 39:43.000]  Like put coins in a mini dispense the Snickers or something.
[39:46.720 --> 39:48.060]  That would be a robot.
[39:48.320 --> 39:50.400]  Can somebody lend Andrew a robot? He's short.
[39:51.840 --> 39:53.640]  This might be the smallest robot.
[39:54.360 --> 39:56.740]  Potentially on this list could be the smallest robot so far.
[39:56.900 --> 39:57.040]  Could be.
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.180]  Yeah, could be.
[39:59.240 --> 40:01.260]  However, we're going to round it out with Gavin.
[40:01.260 --> 40:04.780]  He's making his fourth and final pick in this robot draft.
[40:05.100 --> 40:06.800]  Now you may be predicting what I'm doing here.
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.400]  You might think, you know, I know Gavin, his favorite movie is The Invisible Boy.
[40:11.840 --> 40:13.800]  But that is not my fourth robot pick.
[40:14.280 --> 40:15.400]  Ah, yes, of course.
[40:15.840 --> 40:22.280]  My fourth robot pick is Arok, the housekeeping robot from the 70s.
[40:22.380 --> 40:27.160]  If you just play the first four seconds of this video, it's got Mega Man vibes.
[40:27.320 --> 40:28.940]  You know, it's a robot with a human face.
[40:31.420 --> 40:33.160]  I don't like the beginning of this video.
[40:34.260 --> 40:35.140]  Real bad.
[40:35.420 --> 40:37.360]  No, I don't like that.
[40:37.620 --> 40:40.000]  Very realistic housekeeping robot.
[40:40.140 --> 40:42.140]  It can pour you a drink.
[40:42.320 --> 40:44.120]  It can try and collect your mail.
[40:44.780 --> 40:48.300]  It can try and collect your mail.
[40:48.720 --> 40:51.100]  So far, everything you're describing is a vending machine.
[40:52.840 --> 40:54.000]  Can give you a drink.
[40:54.200 --> 40:55.020]  It can try.
[40:55.100 --> 40:56.280]  It will not be successful.
[40:56.660 --> 40:59.960]  Well, skip to 2.05 in the video if you want to see it attempt to collect mail.
[40:59.960 --> 41:01.940]  Okay, let's go to 2.05.
[41:01.960 --> 41:04.040]  I want to give him a drink right now.
[41:04.480 --> 41:04.600]  Yeah.
[41:05.100 --> 41:05.860]  Okay, let's see.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.340]  So his head's looking up.
[41:07.720 --> 41:08.900]  He's grabbing the mail.
[41:09.480 --> 41:11.000]  Oh, I might have spoken too soon.
[41:11.540 --> 41:13.500]  He's attempting to grab the mail.
[41:13.880 --> 41:15.520]  He's just looking at it.
[41:15.720 --> 41:16.660]  Yeah, he's trying.
[41:17.160 --> 41:17.920]  Okay, he missed.
[41:18.240 --> 41:19.220]  Oh, he touched the mail.
[41:19.740 --> 41:21.020]  He pushed it back in.
[41:21.160 --> 41:22.880]  He kind of bashed it back in, but he tried.
[41:23.160 --> 41:24.860]  Yeah, and then he looks at you directly.
[41:25.260 --> 41:25.880]  I don't like his...
[41:25.880 --> 41:26.840]  I have failed you.
[41:26.840 --> 41:30.860]  I don't like his body with his head, and it has, like, antenna.
[41:31.540 --> 41:34.340]  It has antenna like he's a bug.
[41:34.560 --> 41:36.220]  I don't like... I don't like him.
[41:36.600 --> 41:38.000]  That's a great robot, Gavin.
[41:38.220 --> 41:38.860]  I love it.
[41:39.500 --> 41:41.860]  Ugly, ugly, small robot.
[41:42.700 --> 41:47.720]  I don't want a robot in my life that has the success rate of a claw machine for what it's
[41:47.720 --> 41:48.460]  trying to do.
[41:48.920 --> 41:55.340]  He gets stuck at, uh, like 20 at like 2.41, and the lady has to move him.
[41:55.760 --> 41:59.980]  Yeah, there's also a bit earlier where he's walking a dog, and he accidentally goes off
[41:59.980 --> 42:02.140]  the road, and they have to run and stop him from falling over.
[42:02.220 --> 42:03.080]  Oh, no.
[42:03.180 --> 42:04.720]  It's like 1.07 in the video.
[42:04.820 --> 42:05.100]  It's great.
[42:05.880 --> 42:06.280]  Man.
[42:07.020 --> 42:09.540]  Well, this robot's vile and terrible.
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.000]  I wonder what he looks like now, because all of, like, the whatever that he's made out of
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.800]  is all deteriorated and disgusting.
[42:17.280 --> 42:18.220]  It's probably really awesome.
[42:18.480 --> 42:23.520]  Did you ever see when they found the Hoggle puppet from Labyrinth, like, 30 years after
[42:23.520 --> 42:23.900]  the movie?
[42:24.360 --> 42:24.900]  I don't think so.
[42:24.900 --> 42:26.600]  I bet he would look like that.
[42:26.940 --> 42:27.880]  Hoggle puppet.
[42:28.960 --> 42:30.340]  Oh, oh my god.
[42:32.020 --> 42:33.380]  There you go.
[42:35.780 --> 42:37.640]  They found him in a suitcase.
[42:38.060 --> 42:38.580]  Thumbnail.
[42:38.720 --> 42:39.740]  Oh my god.
[42:40.780 --> 42:41.660]  What the...
[42:41.660 --> 42:43.020]  It's missing its cheek.
[42:43.120 --> 42:44.260]  Its skin is peeling.
[42:44.600 --> 42:45.540]  It looks terrible.
[42:45.920 --> 42:49.620]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure, uh, Five Nights at Freddy's got some inspo from that.
[42:50.040 --> 42:50.660]  Yeah, I think so.
[42:51.480 --> 42:52.860]  I just want to love.
[42:53.540 --> 42:54.660]  Oh, brutal.
[42:54.660 --> 42:55.140]  Is that Freddy?
[42:55.720 --> 42:55.880]  Huh?
[42:56.460 --> 42:57.760]  I've never played those games.
[42:57.840 --> 42:58.660]  I don't know how it works.
[42:59.840 --> 43:00.800]  He's not a replicant.
[43:03.220 --> 43:03.760]  The sequel.
[43:03.860 --> 43:05.060]  There's a cool robot in it.
[43:06.180 --> 43:09.760]  Well, speaking of cool robots, all of the cool robots have been chosen.
[43:10.280 --> 43:12.040]  We've done all the robots in the Robot Draft.
[43:12.180 --> 43:16.740]  Gavin has picked Twilight Zone Robot, Forbidden Planet Robot, Columbo Robot.
[43:17.380 --> 43:17.720]  Robbie the Robot.
[43:18.160 --> 43:18.880]  Robbie the Robot.
[43:19.600 --> 43:20.580]  Who's Robbie the Robot?
[43:20.920 --> 43:23.480]  I was just saying the real name of the robot as you read off each one.
[43:23.480 --> 43:25.160]  It's just called Robbie the Robot.
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.160]  You can't.
[43:26.300 --> 43:26.500]  Okay.
[43:26.660 --> 43:27.440]  How can you do that?
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.480]  You can't pick the same robot three times.
[43:29.660 --> 43:30.360]  You can't pick the same.
[43:30.440 --> 43:32.180]  That's like Andrew picking Bender four times.
[43:32.360 --> 43:34.940]  No, they're different characters, but they're all played by Robbie the Robot.
[43:35.020 --> 43:36.000]  You just told you.
[43:36.720 --> 43:36.940]  What?
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.960]  All right, so audience discount.
[43:40.240 --> 43:41.560]  Two of Gavin's picks.
[43:41.640 --> 43:42.860]  He only had two in this one.
[43:43.060 --> 43:47.300]  Well, like, imagine if, uh, Robert Patrick also voiced Nick Valentine.
[43:47.480 --> 43:48.340]  That's still two robots.
[43:48.800 --> 43:50.240]  Yeah, I get what he's saying.
[43:50.800 --> 43:51.260]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:51.260 --> 43:52.100]  Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[43:52.700 --> 43:53.400]  Yeah, but he voiced it.
[43:53.480 --> 43:55.080]  He's playing a different robot.
[43:55.240 --> 43:57.080]  It's not, it's not Robbie the Robot he's selecting.
[43:57.340 --> 43:59.200]  It's the character he's selecting as the robot.
[43:59.700 --> 44:00.780]  Yeah, that's fair.
[44:00.900 --> 44:02.020]  Like, like Columbo Robot.
[44:02.600 --> 44:02.780]  Yeah.
[44:04.520 --> 44:06.720]  And A-Rock is, uh, your final pick.
[44:06.860 --> 44:11.700]  Nick has T-1000, Bishop, Nick Valentine, and Tom from Toonami.
[44:12.240 --> 44:15.700]  Andrew, uh, the, honestly, the most conventional choices.
[44:15.980 --> 44:17.080]  I'm, I'm shocked.
[44:18.720 --> 44:21.860]  Bender, RoboCop, Mega Man, Mecha Godzilla.
[44:21.860 --> 44:23.320]  Tried to pick Vending Machine, didn't I?
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.280]  I have picked Andrew from Regulation Podcast, Haley Joel Osment Robot from AI,
[44:29.700 --> 44:33.160]  Michael Fassbender Robot from Prometheus, and Harrison Ford Robot from Blade Runner.
[44:33.740 --> 44:38.920]  And Geoff has chosen the Mars Rover, Cro-T Robot, Roomba, and GLaDOS.
[44:39.120 --> 44:42.000]  Guys, those are all of the robots that we chose.
[44:42.080 --> 44:46.580]  How do you guys feel about this, uh, compendium, this full list here of best robots?
[44:46.760 --> 44:47.440]  Well, I want to apologize.
[44:47.980 --> 44:50.960]  Uh, I don't usually do this thing in the drafts,
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.020]  but it's so fun, I can see why it's done so often.
[44:53.500 --> 44:54.660]  I apologize for it.
[44:57.040 --> 44:59.940]  Geoff, do you think he's gonna get just blasted?
[45:00.240 --> 45:02.100]  No, I think he'll be fine. He'll get a pass.
[45:02.460 --> 45:04.000]  It's funny when Gavin does it.
[45:06.660 --> 45:09.140]  Everybody loves Gavin. He's the boy with the golden hands.
[45:12.140 --> 45:18.100]  I was so blown away by the research on this because I, I, typically after we do these,
[45:18.100 --> 45:22.100]  we always do our, like, our, uh, robots that didn't quite make the cut, you know?
[45:22.160 --> 45:22.400]  Sure.
[45:22.760 --> 45:26.560]  Our runners-up. But I kind of want to hold on to them just in case we ever have another robot draft.
[45:26.560 --> 45:27.060]  Oh, interesting.
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.620]  There were so many, I thought.
[45:28.620 --> 45:30.040]  I think there's, I think there's more robots.
[45:30.160 --> 45:33.020]  And then we can see how many more robots Robbie the Robot was in, or whatever.
[45:33.240 --> 45:33.820]  How many more movies?
[45:34.120 --> 45:35.880]  Yeah, let me see what else he was in on IMDb.
[45:35.900 --> 45:38.660]  Work on the fights for why a vending machine is...
[45:38.660 --> 45:42.300]  I have another six on my list that are all, like, big-time robots.
[45:42.640 --> 45:46.100]  Okay, well, that's our robots draft. Thank you so much for watching.

[45:53.640 --> 45:55.220]  But guys, this has been a robot draft.
[45:55.400 --> 45:59.200]  Andrew, as the robot, the resident robot here at Regulation,
[45:59.300 --> 46:02.340]  why don't you take us out with a cool outro and say goodbye?
[46:02.760 --> 46:03.360]  Yeah. Oh, I got it.
[46:03.400 --> 46:05.860]  Do you mind if I, uh, use my native tongue for this?
[46:05.940 --> 46:07.060]  Please, by all means.
[46:07.600 --> 46:11.580]  Beep boop beep beep beep beep boop boop boop beep boop boop boop boop beep boop
[46:11.580 --> 46:15.640]  one zero zero one beep boop boop boop beep beep
[46:15.640 --> 46:16.160]  Snickers.
[46:16.840 --> 46:17.960]  Goodbye.
