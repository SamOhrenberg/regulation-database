[00:00.000 --> 00:03.340]  Hello and welcome to another regulation supplemental.
[00:03.340 --> 00:07.680]  We are breaking down our summer movie auction that we did.
[00:07.760 --> 00:12.040]  If you have not looked at that at all, go back and listen to that supplemental
[00:12.480 --> 00:14.700]  and then come back here. It's over now.
[00:14.940 --> 00:16.440]  We're done. We finished it.
[00:17.040 --> 00:17.960]  Everyone bought movies.
[00:18.200 --> 00:22.740]  We did totals and we are here to kind of reflect on the summer.
[00:22.760 --> 00:25.120]  That was how we feel about it.
[00:25.720 --> 00:26.980]  All that sort of good stuff.
[00:26.980 --> 00:29.040]  How do you guys feel about how things went?
[00:29.200 --> 00:30.260]  Because I liked it a lot.
[00:30.460 --> 00:31.320]  I feel medium.
[00:31.820 --> 00:35.140]  I don't know how I didn't catch up with you.
[00:35.260 --> 00:38.080]  I don't know how Alien didn't get me there.
[00:38.780 --> 00:41.160]  Uh, Power Deadpool Wolverine.
[00:41.320 --> 00:44.380]  Can't stop Deadpool Wolverine for so long.
[00:44.760 --> 00:46.680]  Good Lord. You wrote Inside Out too.
[00:46.800 --> 00:49.280]  I feel the same way about Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[00:49.500 --> 00:53.140]  But like, for some reason, it didn't... nothing happened with it.
[00:53.200 --> 00:55.300]  Like, I don't know where like Crown Mania went.
[00:55.300 --> 00:57.820]  But like, it fell off.
[00:57.900 --> 00:58.660]  They just didn't know.
[00:59.440 --> 01:01.700]  I think all the Harold heads out there are like, when's that?
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.400]  Oh, it's out. It came out already.
[01:03.880 --> 01:06.420]  Oh, they're busy reading the books.
[01:06.580 --> 01:08.120]  They forgot there's a movie.
[01:08.300 --> 01:09.340]  Oh, we blew it.
[01:09.460 --> 01:10.660]  Oh, we blew it, Harold heads.
[01:10.940 --> 01:15.000]  Can you imagine walking out of Harold and the Purple Crayon and saying the book was better?
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.700]  No, I can't imagine walking out of Harold and the Purple Crayon at all.
[01:21.980 --> 01:23.360]  It's going to be Harold and the Purple Crayon day.
[01:23.360 --> 01:26.060]  I got some Harold and Purple Crayon on the podcast we record later.
[01:26.700 --> 01:30.640]  I'd love I'd love to know how much movie, how much money that movie.
[01:30.840 --> 01:33.500]  What? How much money did it make?
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.500]  How much money did it make?
[01:35.960 --> 01:37.140]  How money make movie?
[01:37.380 --> 01:38.640]  Hey, do you want to have a look?
[01:38.700 --> 01:40.980]  Because here's like our actual draft and. Oh, yeah.
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.380]  So we're recording the screen if you want to visually watch this.
[01:43.580 --> 01:46.320]  Yeah, but it's been a long day already. Someone has put together
[01:47.500 --> 01:49.420]  a leaderboard here for some reason.
[01:49.540 --> 01:51.540]  I mean, I think it's in like reverse order.
[01:51.540 --> 01:53.060]  It's got as a bug.
[01:53.620 --> 01:57.360]  Yeah. So here, Geoff, we can look at Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[01:59.440 --> 02:00.320]  Seventeen million.
[02:00.900 --> 02:02.920]  Yeah. That's more than I would have guessed.
[02:03.100 --> 02:05.440]  Seventeen million movie. OK. Seventeen million.
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.460]  Wow. That's great.
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.060]  What was this budget? Way more than Fabulous Four.
[02:13.440 --> 02:15.760]  More than Fabulous Four and DeeDee together.
[02:15.980 --> 02:18.160]  Ooh, boy. More than Borderlands.
[02:18.460 --> 02:20.600]  No. Oh, wow.
[02:21.100 --> 02:22.740]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[02:23.200 --> 02:25.080]  Wow. That's crazy to look at.
[02:25.220 --> 02:27.200]  That is. Wow. Wow.
[02:27.820 --> 02:29.880]  What did Untitled Horror end up being?
[02:31.000 --> 02:32.200]  Still Untitled. Nothing.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.440]  Yeah. OK. Never came out. Still not out.
[02:34.920 --> 02:36.840]  I got robbed of Horizon.
[02:36.940 --> 02:38.600]  What was Horizon Part One? How much did that make?
[02:39.400 --> 02:41.320]  Twenty nine million. Twenty nine million.
[02:41.720 --> 02:45.200]  Wouldn't have been enough. All the Horizon homies forgot to show up.
[02:45.340 --> 02:48.320]  Unfortunately, even that one has taken me ahead of Andrew.
[02:48.500 --> 02:49.280]  Look at the graph, Eric.
[02:49.540 --> 02:50.200]  How far off were you?
[02:50.200 --> 02:51.220]  Do you want to have a look at the graph?
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.620]  Look, look at the end there.
[02:54.860 --> 02:56.080]  Oh, my God.
[02:56.160 --> 02:57.920]  Look at Andrew overtaking me.
[02:58.260 --> 03:01.780]  Then a little bit later, Alien came out and I just hovered
[03:01.780 --> 03:05.820]  perfectly underneath his line the entire way to the end.
[03:06.380 --> 03:08.080]  There was like no week.
[03:08.220 --> 03:11.880]  There was no day where I made ground and he didn't make the same ground.
[03:12.700 --> 03:15.320]  That is insane. Was I ever in first?
[03:17.940 --> 03:20.320]  Maybe. No, maybe for now.
[03:20.760 --> 03:21.500]  No. Yeah.
[03:21.740 --> 03:24.940]  Got the first like that first week or so was real sweet to Geoff.
[03:25.080 --> 03:27.620]  Felt real good. Oh, there you were.
[03:27.900 --> 03:29.040]  What a day. Wow.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.220]  June 2nd, a day that will end the third.
[03:32.820 --> 03:34.720]  Oh, my gosh. The fourth. Oh, you had to run.
[03:35.200 --> 03:37.580]  Oh, my God. A week that will live in infamy.
[03:37.720 --> 03:40.440]  Oh, my God. And then and then you check it out.
[03:41.900 --> 03:45.200]  Oh, my God. Inside out.
[03:45.200 --> 03:47.440]  A million dollars swing instantly.
[03:47.800 --> 03:49.460]  Shit. Look at that.
[03:49.760 --> 03:51.500]  Almost 100 million.
[03:52.180 --> 03:57.080]  So Inside Out 2 and Deadpool and Wolverine ended up being respectively
[03:57.080 --> 03:59.980]  the most successful films in their genre ever, right?
[04:01.360 --> 04:03.540]  Yeah, I would say so for like the R-rated.
[04:03.780 --> 04:08.360]  Is there a higher and more financially successful R-rated movie?
[04:08.800 --> 04:10.440]  I don't know. I don't believe there is.
[04:10.940 --> 04:13.080]  Sure as shit wasn't Showgirls.
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.680]  Now, I think that we have all had a lot to say so far,
[04:18.780 --> 04:20.280]  but Nick has been like weirdly quiet.
[04:21.160 --> 04:23.440]  I spent a lot of money for not a lot of Pam.
[04:24.920 --> 04:28.460]  We really thought like you like, look at this, Nick.
[04:28.680 --> 04:30.920]  Look at this run. I listen.
[04:31.580 --> 04:34.840]  I live in second place, second place, second place, second place, second place.
[04:35.900 --> 04:37.260]  Eating fucking dust.
[04:37.520 --> 04:39.220]  And then Geoff did it right at the end.
[04:39.220 --> 04:43.540]  And then I Beetlejuiced him.
[04:44.040 --> 04:46.920]  I felt bad because my line's pretty horizontal.
[04:47.520 --> 04:49.400]  Like I got like a bump here, whatever.
[04:49.620 --> 04:51.080]  Mine's pretty low the whole way.
[04:51.620 --> 04:53.800]  Nick, what happened?
[04:54.000 --> 04:55.040]  It's such a good start.
[04:55.620 --> 04:57.680]  You just stop drafting movies?
[04:59.300 --> 05:00.240]  It's interesting.
[05:00.560 --> 05:02.620]  The studio just ran out of money.
[05:02.920 --> 05:03.700]  I don't know what happened.
[05:04.920 --> 05:07.900]  Yeah, let's go back to the to the Excel sheet.
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.920]  Well, we can have a look at what everyone drafted here.
[05:10.960 --> 05:11.340]  All right.
[05:13.540 --> 05:15.260]  Oh, Despicable Me 4.
[05:15.660 --> 05:17.320]  Really put it all on Despicable Me.
[05:17.880 --> 05:22.580]  There is a alternate reality where Nick lets me get it at 79 points
[05:22.580 --> 05:24.460]  and our things are flipped completely.
[05:25.320 --> 05:25.440]  Yep.
[05:26.360 --> 05:31.120]  I think I was so burned out on recent MCU that I didn't even care about
[05:31.120 --> 05:33.160]  Deadpool, Wolfram, when we were doing this.
[05:33.740 --> 05:36.380]  And then and then as it came up, the hype was insane.
[05:36.380 --> 05:37.460]  And then the movie was good.
[05:37.460 --> 05:39.960]  I was like, yeah, wow, they fixed it.
[05:40.680 --> 05:43.340]  Dude, I watched Bad Boys Ride or Die on the plane.
[05:44.280 --> 05:45.640]  That was a that was a great.
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.900]  There's there's some cool moments, but like, oh, I liked it a lot.
[05:49.100 --> 05:50.160]  I haven't seen it yet.
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.480]  I was totally fine with it.
[05:51.640 --> 05:52.960]  It's you watch it.
[05:53.060 --> 05:53.860]  Well, here's the problem.
[05:53.940 --> 05:57.640]  I watched Bad Boys 2, then Bad Boys 1 and then Bad Boys Ride or Die.
[05:57.720 --> 06:00.900]  And I went, well, this is not a Michael Bay movie at all.
[06:01.180 --> 06:02.020]  Like, not even close.
[06:02.440 --> 06:05.080]  Yeah, I do like that he's in them, though.
[06:05.080 --> 06:10.020]  Like as a little like not like approval, like they bring him in for both the last two.
[06:10.320 --> 06:12.040]  Oh, yeah, he did have a cameo in four.
[06:12.240 --> 06:16.680]  Yeah, I'm pleased that with less points, the next single movie,
[06:16.700 --> 06:19.200]  I managed to get three nine figure movies, though.
[06:21.120 --> 06:23.820]  So what was the difference between Gavin and I?
[06:24.440 --> 06:26.320]  I came in first, Gavin was second.
[06:27.600 --> 06:31.200]  I guess that would be on the on the top leaderboard, I would say.
[06:32.320 --> 06:33.440]  Where am I looking here?
[06:33.620 --> 06:34.640]  No, it's just the top number.
[06:34.640 --> 06:37.860]  So billion 30 and then 981.
[06:38.220 --> 06:40.360]  So like 50 million.
[06:42.120 --> 06:42.960]  It's crazy.
[06:43.200 --> 06:45.120]  Just under like 49 million.
[06:45.560 --> 06:47.760]  The 15 bucks I was saving didn't come into play, really.
[06:47.860 --> 06:49.840]  I thought maybe I thought it would.
[06:49.960 --> 06:51.160]  I felt like mine was going.
[06:51.240 --> 06:52.940]  I got nine bucks sitting in my pocket.
[06:52.980 --> 06:54.640]  And then I don't know, man.
[06:55.540 --> 06:57.280]  Why is Janna Planet right?
[06:57.320 --> 07:00.100]  During the auction, the points of this movie were not recorded correctly
[07:00.100 --> 07:01.240]  instead of inputting them.
[07:01.380 --> 07:03.380]  Oh, OK, that's so you got a free movie.
[07:04.100 --> 07:07.800]  Yeah, but it only made it made me less than one million dollars.
[07:08.060 --> 07:12.240]  Look, I want to say, even though you came in fifth, I think I think that's a DQ.
[07:12.240 --> 07:13.100]  What? No way.
[07:13.120 --> 07:13.620]  I think you're disqualified.
[07:14.000 --> 07:14.760]  Yeah, you know what?
[07:15.320 --> 07:16.800]  I think you're totally out.
[07:17.100 --> 07:18.140]  The studio couldn't have got that movie.
[07:18.420 --> 07:18.980]  What do you mean?
[07:19.760 --> 07:20.160]  Embarrassing.
[07:20.420 --> 07:22.060]  Here, hey, Gavin, you know what?
[07:22.100 --> 07:24.200]  You can take one million dollars away.
[07:24.380 --> 07:26.400]  That's even more than this movie made.
[07:26.440 --> 07:30.160]  You can take one million dollars away from me and we'll see where that puts me.
[07:30.260 --> 07:30.500]  Hang on.
[07:30.720 --> 07:33.080]  If it was the last movie you drafted, I would say that would work.
[07:33.080 --> 07:34.700]  But it because it happened early.
[07:34.860 --> 07:35.480]  I don't know.
[07:35.580 --> 07:36.220]  I think that's DQ.
[07:37.160 --> 07:37.780]  Hmm. No.
[07:38.340 --> 07:39.440]  That's what I like about Texas.
[07:40.000 --> 07:43.220]  Is there a way that Gavin could have won with those 15 points?
[07:43.340 --> 07:43.860]  Thanks, Nick.
[07:44.600 --> 07:45.940]  I like the what?
[07:46.340 --> 07:48.440]  With the 15 points he had left.
[07:48.560 --> 07:49.320]  Fifteen dollars.
[07:49.880 --> 07:50.180]  Uh-huh.
[07:50.440 --> 07:51.180]  Look at the movies.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.340]  Look, go back to where all the movies were.
[07:53.700 --> 07:56.660]  I wonder if there is a way that Gavin could have won.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.560]  Well, yeah, if he didn't put it on Horizon Zero Dawn part two or whatever.
[08:01.560 --> 08:01.960]  Right?
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.000]  Like if he would have saved a point there, because there's what?
[08:08.160 --> 08:09.800]  There's one, two, three here.
[08:10.080 --> 08:10.860]  Look what I've got there.
[08:11.320 --> 08:13.720]  Yeah. Could you go back to the the board?
[08:13.920 --> 08:14.540]  The other thing.
[08:14.700 --> 08:15.280]  Oh, he could have got Beetle.
[08:15.320 --> 08:16.840]  He could have probably gone for Beetlejuice.
[08:17.100 --> 08:17.640]  Let's see how much.
[08:17.860 --> 08:21.140]  Like, let's just look at the movies and what they went for in the
[08:22.480 --> 08:24.120]  the community made website.
[08:25.260 --> 08:27.680]  I remember going for Beetlejuice, but I didn't have enough money.
[08:28.240 --> 08:30.760]  So let's open up Geoff or yeah, that works.
[08:30.760 --> 08:32.520]  I think I got it for not too much money.
[08:32.640 --> 08:33.080]  It was at the end.
[08:33.360 --> 08:35.240]  It should be at the very bottom, Beetlejuice.
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.640]  So do you want to see it by points or you just want to see it by release date?
[08:39.140 --> 08:40.460]  Release date. Scroll down, Beetlejuice.
[08:40.640 --> 08:41.260]  16 points.
[08:41.420 --> 08:42.340]  One more than I had.
[08:43.400 --> 08:43.940]  One more.
[08:44.460 --> 08:46.720]  I think it was 16 because I was going to put 15.
[08:48.260 --> 08:49.340]  Wow. I see.
[08:49.600 --> 08:52.800]  OK, so I really screwed myself with Horizon then.
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.060]  Yeah. Wow.
[08:54.360 --> 08:55.440]  Because because I would have had.
[08:56.360 --> 08:57.200]  Dang, look at that.
[08:57.240 --> 09:00.060]  I would have had 21 points.
[09:00.060 --> 09:02.620]  So did Geoff have more than that still there?
[09:03.040 --> 09:04.020]  What about Trap?
[09:04.640 --> 09:08.380]  I did. It ends with us three points for 148 million.
[09:08.860 --> 09:09.340]  It's pretty good.
[09:09.820 --> 09:10.540]  Wait, that's you?
[09:11.060 --> 09:11.460]  Yeah.
[09:11.860 --> 09:13.020]  You did it ends with us?
[09:13.120 --> 09:15.560]  Well, it says that during the auction, the points for this movie
[09:15.560 --> 09:16.680]  were not recorded correctly.
[09:16.960 --> 09:19.700]  Instead of setting the point value to zero, we have the intended value.
[09:19.800 --> 09:20.860]  So does that mean Geoff is disqualified?
[09:21.600 --> 09:23.080]  Wait, I'm afraid so.
[09:23.160 --> 09:24.680]  I guess so. OK, just making sure.
[09:25.400 --> 09:26.780]  I guess Eric and I are both disqualified.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.040]  Yeah, yeah. Me and Geoff are disqualified.
[09:28.040 --> 09:30.520]  Or I get an extra 148 million is what it's saying.
[09:32.440 --> 09:36.480]  But wait, how many points did you have left at the Beetlejuice mark?
[09:38.180 --> 09:41.720]  I ended up having eight left after I bought it, I think.
[09:41.900 --> 09:42.880]  OK, so. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah.
[09:42.980 --> 09:45.660]  So you know, Geoff, you had four left at the end.
[09:45.660 --> 09:46.500]  So you had 20 points.
[09:46.620 --> 09:47.780]  Looks like you had 20 points total.
[09:49.300 --> 09:51.240]  Wait, so that changes everything, doesn't it?
[09:52.100 --> 09:52.820]  Why is that?
[09:53.840 --> 09:54.500]  What do you mean?
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.460]  Articulate how it changes anything.
[09:58.620 --> 10:02.300]  You can't just say that changes everything and then wait for everybody to agree.
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.940]  Well, I think what would have made a bigger change is if you bought Trap,
[10:10.380 --> 10:13.980]  which is three points, you probably could have got it for four or five.
[10:14.380 --> 10:16.380]  Yeah. And that's 42 million.
[10:17.720 --> 10:18.940]  And with that was a huge hit.
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.720]  With Geoff and Eric getting free movies and my movie
[10:22.720 --> 10:25.360]  absorbing six points didn't come out.
[10:27.160 --> 10:28.860]  Damn. I feel like I could have had this.
[10:30.180 --> 10:30.840]  Oh, you're close.
[10:31.020 --> 10:32.540]  You had it for most of the summer.
[10:32.900 --> 10:35.220]  So did we find out if it changed everything or not?
[10:35.300 --> 10:36.440]  I still don't know if it changed.
[10:36.560 --> 10:37.760]  No, I don't think it changed anything.
[10:37.960 --> 10:39.060]  I'm just making sure. Thank you.
[10:42.940 --> 10:44.740]  Most people thought you were going to win this, Gavin.
[10:45.080 --> 10:47.340]  He still would have been able to outbid me by a couple of points.
[10:47.440 --> 10:50.520]  But if I didn't.
[10:52.640 --> 10:54.220]  Lose Horizon, it would have changed everything.
[10:56.800 --> 10:58.760]  He keeps saying it.
[10:59.320 --> 11:02.660]  Basically, if one variable changes, it changes everything.
[11:04.580 --> 11:05.580]  That's how life works.
[11:06.260 --> 11:09.580]  Yeah. I mean, I suppose sliding doors.
[11:10.200 --> 11:13.540]  So you're a real Gwyneth Paltrow, Gavin.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.160]  So with that, with Geoff's, it ends with us.
[11:17.220 --> 11:19.560]  That's definitely the most money per point.
[11:20.640 --> 11:22.920]  I would think so. That's got to be pretty good.
[11:23.680 --> 11:24.300]  That's real good.
[11:24.300 --> 11:26.800]  Is that what the column on the right is?
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.220]  50 million a point.
[11:28.880 --> 11:31.360]  So, yeah, 148 million is how much it made.
[11:31.740 --> 11:33.700]  And Geoff spent three points on it.
[11:33.980 --> 11:36.220]  So 49 million per point. Yeah.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.140]  The best value of any movie.
[11:38.580 --> 11:41.200]  That's crazy. What was Wolverine's value?
[11:41.980 --> 11:42.880]  Had to be pretty good.
[11:43.040 --> 11:43.780]  What do you mean value?
[11:44.340 --> 11:45.620]  Like point to money.
[11:46.100 --> 11:47.120]  It's nine million.
[11:47.700 --> 11:48.280]  Nine million.
[11:48.900 --> 11:50.060]  9.292 million.
[11:50.480 --> 11:51.980]  And Inside Out 2 is 14 million.
[11:51.980 --> 11:54.820]  Harold and the Purple Crayon was was five million a point.
[11:54.940 --> 11:57.020]  Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talking about.
[11:57.440 --> 12:00.580]  So Twisters and it ends with us with phenomenal value per point.
[12:01.160 --> 12:01.820]  Yeah. Yeah.
[12:02.240 --> 12:03.600]  Oh, they got it for me for sure.
[12:05.160 --> 12:07.560]  The Watchers, do you want to just go through everyone's list
[12:07.560 --> 12:10.740]  and maybe we each talk about like what how we feel about these?
[12:10.760 --> 12:11.820]  Let's start from the bottom.
[12:12.280 --> 12:15.320]  Yeah, the strangers heard it sucked.
[12:16.020 --> 12:17.660]  Furiosa, I'm disappointed.
[12:18.020 --> 12:21.500]  I thought that like all I heard is that like this was a box office flop
[12:21.500 --> 12:23.340]  and looking at 67 million dollars.
[12:23.600 --> 12:24.480]  That's pretty awesome.
[12:24.880 --> 12:28.020]  Should have been well over 100, I would think. Right?
[12:29.080 --> 12:30.160]  I could get to that film.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.460]  I just don't like it's weird.
[12:32.580 --> 12:34.300]  That movie came and went so quick.
[12:34.780 --> 12:37.540]  Yeah. And there's no strange discussion.
[12:37.940 --> 12:40.920]  And the same way that the last Mad Max, it felt like it floated
[12:40.920 --> 12:45.040]  and you're seeing posts about it and memes and like just none of that for this.
[12:45.120 --> 12:46.580]  It just had nothing on Fury Road.
[12:47.100 --> 12:48.840]  Yeah, I agree. I agree.
[12:48.840 --> 12:51.300]  And then here's an anime thing.
[12:51.440 --> 12:53.120]  Here's Janet Planet, Maxine.
[12:53.660 --> 12:54.800]  I didn't expect that to do.
[12:55.080 --> 12:57.340]  I mean, 15 million is pretty great for that.
[12:57.720 --> 12:59.480]  I'm just glad they're done making those movies.
[12:59.560 --> 13:00.080]  That's pretty great.
[13:00.360 --> 13:04.660]  Is Janet Planet the worst point to money value on the entire list?
[13:05.100 --> 13:06.800]  Might be. It might be.
[13:07.480 --> 13:09.060]  The crow would like a word.
[13:09.520 --> 13:10.840]  No, not the crow!
[13:12.480 --> 13:13.760]  396 for Janet Planet.
[13:13.920 --> 13:14.680]  Let's have a look. Hang on.
[13:14.740 --> 13:16.960]  We're scrolling. 102 for Ryan's World.
[13:17.440 --> 13:17.720]  Sorry.
[13:19.180 --> 13:20.640]  100 grand per point.
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.380]  Yep, it's Ryan's World.
[13:23.460 --> 13:24.200]  That's expensive.
[13:24.800 --> 13:24.920]  Yep.
[13:26.120 --> 13:30.460]  Didi Megadudu, Harold and the Purple Crayon didn't didn't pull for me.
[13:30.780 --> 13:31.720]  Harold Heads didn't come through.
[13:32.180 --> 13:34.000]  Borderlands making less money.
[13:34.260 --> 13:38.260]  That's like 11 points here is crazy.
[13:38.740 --> 13:41.600]  Man. Like in retrospect, we knew it wasn't going to do well.
[13:42.360 --> 13:44.660]  I figured it was going to do more than that.
[13:44.660 --> 13:49.980]  It was going to be like a 48 million dollar flop, not a 15 million dollar.
[13:50.380 --> 13:53.060]  It made less overall than I thought it would do opening weekend.
[13:53.340 --> 13:57.460]  Yes, me too. I think what happened, this is just speculation.
[13:57.960 --> 14:02.700]  I think that Borderlands came out at a time where there were too many
[14:02.700 --> 14:05.740]  other meme-y little shitty movies.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.340]  So you couldn't grab onto it.
[14:08.440 --> 14:10.640]  You're riding the wave of Deadpool and Wolverine, which is like
[14:10.640 --> 14:11.660]  dominating the conversation.
[14:11.660 --> 14:15.400]  Harold and the Purple Crayon was the one that people memed
[14:15.920 --> 14:17.960]  and it did and it helped to get to 17.
[14:18.300 --> 14:19.520]  Nobody memed Borderlands.
[14:20.040 --> 14:24.660]  Like it did not grab and push at all, which is really, really tough.
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.440]  Trap, I saw I helped it out.
[14:27.580 --> 14:29.000]  I thought it was very for three points.
[14:29.300 --> 14:30.620]  Banger. Oh, pretty great.
[14:30.860 --> 14:32.240]  Pretty good. That's a pretty good return, man.
[14:32.720 --> 14:33.540]  The Crow.
[14:35.120 --> 14:37.560]  I think I was just trying to get rid of points at this point.
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.340]  You were. It was you guys were running out of movies and had points left.
[14:41.340 --> 14:44.140]  So it created inflated value on these.
[14:44.440 --> 14:46.260]  They spent twenty three points on it.
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.940]  The Crow doing under 10 million makes sense if you see the crow.
[14:51.140 --> 14:54.200]  Like if you watch this movie, you just be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:54.200 --> 14:57.140]  More people wanted to watch Ronald Reagan than the Crow.
[14:59.400 --> 15:02.020]  Well, this is definitely an AstroTurf thing.
[15:02.100 --> 15:04.920]  This is a thing where like weird, like
[15:05.960 --> 15:09.620]  voting packs are like, we're going to buy all the tickets, but no one's going to go.
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.140]  I think that's what happened here for Reagan.
[15:11.140 --> 15:12.980]  So that's tough, but that's mine.
[15:13.160 --> 15:14.760]  You know that it is what it is.
[15:15.560 --> 15:17.180]  Nick, let's have a look at yours. What do you think?
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.560]  Oh, my God. That's all you got.
[15:19.140 --> 15:19.840]  Yeah, it was.
[15:20.940 --> 15:24.200]  It was a lot of not foresight and a lot of upfront spending.
[15:24.340 --> 15:26.320]  Nick, this is all within a month and a half.
[15:28.320 --> 15:31.380]  This is like this all within 40 days.
[15:32.420 --> 15:33.760]  I I was at the table.
[15:33.880 --> 15:35.020]  I said, let it ride.
[15:35.040 --> 15:37.380]  And I kept saying it and I kept saying it.
[15:37.420 --> 15:39.700]  And before you know it, woke up with no money.
[15:42.900 --> 15:45.360]  Back to black costing the same amount of trap.
[15:45.620 --> 15:47.980]  Yeah. Oh, that's very funny. Yeah.
[15:48.580 --> 15:52.020]  I was taking some low gambles at first and then just jumped full on in.
[15:52.120 --> 15:56.080]  Yeah. For just me and rough trade, bud.
[15:56.300 --> 15:58.360]  Sorry, I should have. I should have let Andrew go.
[15:58.640 --> 15:59.380]  Yeah, you should have.
[15:59.440 --> 16:03.380]  So going through it, Nick spent three points back to black, got six million for it.
[16:04.200 --> 16:07.920]  Then site two points and he got seven million.
[16:08.560 --> 16:11.280]  Yeah. Followed by blue, some anime thing.
[16:11.660 --> 16:13.300]  One point one point eight million.
[16:14.060 --> 16:15.720]  A quiet place day one.
[16:16.180 --> 16:16.840]  Goodbye, Nick.
[16:17.040 --> 16:17.740]  Ten points.
[16:18.260 --> 16:19.080]  Hundred thirty eight million.
[16:19.640 --> 16:21.040]  Can't believe that many people saw it.
[16:21.100 --> 16:22.620]  That's nuts. It was really good.
[16:22.960 --> 16:23.940]  I didn't see it in theaters.
[16:24.080 --> 16:26.860]  I watched it when it came out on VOD, but I really enjoyed it.
[16:26.900 --> 16:31.300]  Like, I'm not a huge quiet place fan, but I thought that was the best one by far.
[16:31.520 --> 16:31.960]  It was really good.
[16:32.120 --> 16:34.620]  Oh, and then Despicable Me four.
[16:35.180 --> 16:38.980]  Three hundred sixty million is what it earned and spent 80 points on it.
[16:39.240 --> 16:41.880]  You and I were going back and forth for Despicable Me.
[16:42.060 --> 16:43.380]  That one got really out of hand.
[16:43.700 --> 16:44.240]  But it did.
[16:45.320 --> 16:47.420]  But also look at the domestic point.
[16:48.020 --> 16:52.240]  Like the how much it made to point out only four and a half.
[16:53.280 --> 16:56.080]  Why are you are you happy to have missed out on that one, Andrew?
[16:56.340 --> 16:57.280]  Oh, I'm so happy.
[16:57.440 --> 16:58.360]  Yeah, because I'm Nick.
[16:58.600 --> 17:02.040]  If that doesn't. Yeah, if that goes forward, I'm Nick.
[17:02.120 --> 17:03.900]  And Nick has Deadpool Wolverine.
[17:03.900 --> 17:05.680]  And I am Nick, and this sucks.
[17:09.440 --> 17:10.920]  Let's have a look at Geoff here.
[17:11.440 --> 17:13.620]  Yeah, we might mind can be pretty quick.
[17:13.780 --> 17:15.600]  I like shopping.
[17:16.420 --> 17:18.880]  Scattershot approach, sort of a shotgun approach, if you will.
[17:20.260 --> 17:21.600]  Clearly, it had a big, big win.
[17:21.660 --> 17:25.640]  And if at over ten million dollars, I really knew that was going to do well for me.
[17:26.580 --> 17:27.720]  It ends with us.
[17:28.120 --> 17:29.100]  Surprise hit of the summer.
[17:29.160 --> 17:29.860]  I had an idea.
[17:29.860 --> 17:33.860]  My wife does has a book talk podcast with Eric's wife.
[17:33.980 --> 17:34.920]  So I, you know.
[17:35.300 --> 17:35.680]  That was good.
[17:35.860 --> 17:40.140]  I have my ear to the ground, as it were, you know, about as to what's popular
[17:40.140 --> 17:41.100]  in the in book talk.
[17:41.460 --> 17:44.880]  It's called Clutch My Pearls, and you can listen to it wherever you get podcasts.
[17:45.440 --> 17:46.000]  There you go.
[17:46.080 --> 17:47.680]  Beatles, I was trying to be a little more subtle.
[17:47.980 --> 17:51.520]  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice obviously pulled pulled me up at the end
[17:51.520 --> 17:54.840]  to climb the Nick hump, which I was glad to get ahead of.
[17:55.940 --> 17:58.920]  Real disappointed in fucking Kevin Costner.
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.820]  That's my takeaway from the summer.
[18:01.080 --> 18:03.060]  You're just really, really let me down.
[18:03.200 --> 18:03.760]  I think he feels
[18:05.880 --> 18:09.180]  there was during the when we did this.
[18:09.620 --> 18:13.120]  I thought it was hilarious that you bought the first and showed zero interest
[18:13.120 --> 18:13.700]  in the second.
[18:13.940 --> 18:17.880]  And what a great fucking vision
[18:17.880 --> 18:20.060]  you had of how that thing would play out.
[18:20.140 --> 18:21.860]  Spent too much on the first.
[18:22.240 --> 18:25.500]  But man, did you call the drop off between?
[18:25.500 --> 18:26.020]  Yeah.
[18:27.740 --> 18:29.180]  And just crazy.
[18:29.500 --> 18:30.580]  Trying to thread a needle.
[18:31.240 --> 18:33.360]  Looking at just movies, the bike riders.
[18:33.960 --> 18:36.660]  What was that, four points for 21 million?
[18:36.980 --> 18:38.920]  I don't think I know anyone who has seen that movie.
[18:39.000 --> 18:39.900]  I forgot it exists.
[18:40.100 --> 18:42.360]  It's a movie I forget about constantly.
[18:43.440 --> 18:46.780]  I think it's because Tom Hardy has a bad accent in it or something.
[18:47.120 --> 18:48.340]  Yeah, he does. That's great.
[18:48.420 --> 18:48.580]  Yeah.
[18:49.140 --> 18:53.360]  Well, we were thinking that Ryan's world, the movie was the worst point to money.
[18:54.860 --> 18:59.480]  But but I did spend six points on zero dollars because of Kevin Costner.
[18:59.480 --> 19:01.020]  Oh, that is true.
[19:02.780 --> 19:04.500]  Tough. Yeah, yeah.
[19:04.720 --> 19:09.220]  So so point value being one sixth of nothing per dollar spent.
[19:10.820 --> 19:12.100]  Geoff, anything else here?
[19:12.340 --> 19:14.300]  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice doing it.
[19:14.580 --> 19:15.180]  Pretty good stuff.
[19:15.680 --> 19:18.600]  Yeah, you know, clearly, I wish it would have come out a little earlier
[19:18.600 --> 19:22.480]  in the summer, but I knew I was taking a risk getting it at the end of the year.
[19:22.480 --> 19:26.140]  And like I said, I'm just glad it was there to help me climb, climb Nick.
[19:26.700 --> 19:29.480]  How many of these movies have you seen, Geoff, that you have?
[19:29.740 --> 19:32.720]  I have seen on my list.
[19:36.680 --> 19:39.940]  If so, you started it out, you went to the first one.
[19:40.180 --> 19:41.320]  You didn't even see Beetlejuice?
[19:41.920 --> 19:45.560]  Millie and I saw if now I saw a lot of movies on other people's lists,
[19:45.580 --> 19:47.360]  but that's the only one I saw from my list, man.
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.460]  I have a question, how did how did some movies on this list not come out?
[19:52.460 --> 19:54.780]  And then there were some movies that came out that weren't on this list.
[19:55.080 --> 19:56.240]  A good question. What do you mean?
[19:56.600 --> 19:58.200]  Wasn't there a Transformers movie that came out?
[19:58.660 --> 20:02.140]  Yeah. So typically we would cut this off
[20:02.920 --> 20:06.480]  at the end of August, but we did this like a week later.
[20:06.960 --> 20:09.780]  Yeah. Then. So it went one week longer.
[20:09.880 --> 20:12.600]  So it was the first week of September was the cutoff.
[20:13.100 --> 20:17.120]  What about the Nicolas Cage horror movie that came out that made a bunch of money?
[20:17.560 --> 20:20.320]  Long legs. Yeah, that just may have just slipped under the radar
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.800]  for the list that I was using.
[20:22.840 --> 20:25.620]  Oh, but that could have been my untitled horror film I bought.
[20:26.740 --> 20:28.440]  David Chase's Long Legs.
[20:31.320 --> 20:32.380]  This is Pauly.
[20:32.700 --> 20:34.140]  Yeah. Pauly on stilts.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.800]  Gavin, you ready to move on to your list?
[20:36.280 --> 20:38.120]  Just shy of a billion. Wow.
[20:39.220 --> 20:40.980]  Here it is. Wow. Not a lot.
[20:43.380 --> 20:43.900]  Not a lot.
[20:46.520 --> 20:47.720]  All right. Good insight.
[20:47.720 --> 20:49.160]  City of Tree, I don't even remember.
[20:49.720 --> 20:50.840]  Did I really have those?
[20:51.200 --> 20:55.380]  So Gavin opened with Bad Boys Ride or Die for 12 points, made $193 million
[20:55.940 --> 20:57.780]  domestic. I really liked it.
[20:57.860 --> 20:59.180]  I know you watched it in a way.
[20:59.300 --> 21:01.300]  We already kind of covered it, Eric. It wasn't your favorite.
[21:01.560 --> 21:03.660]  I think outside of Bad Boys, do my favorite Bad Boys.
[21:03.780 --> 21:05.160]  I think it's better than one.
[21:05.180 --> 21:06.240]  I think it's more enjoyable.
[21:09.580 --> 21:10.440]  Inside Out 2.
[21:11.640 --> 21:12.540]  Anyone see that?
[21:12.900 --> 21:13.980]  One of the biggest movies this summer?
[21:14.040 --> 21:15.320]  I don't think any of us saw it, but it was.
[21:15.320 --> 21:19.520]  It did pretty much double Despicable Me, which was.
[21:20.080 --> 21:21.780]  Crazy. Which was cool.
[21:22.240 --> 21:23.880]  It just kept making money.
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.860]  Yep. And then you had Alien Romulus come out.
[21:29.180 --> 21:31.560]  Spent 13 points on that for $104 million.
[21:32.220 --> 21:34.620]  I think that should have done slightly more.
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.760]  Really? Was it good?
[21:37.280 --> 21:40.440]  I think in recent... I'd be interested to see
[21:40.940 --> 21:43.920]  where it stacks up against all the alien movies as a whole.
[21:43.920 --> 21:44.700]  Number three.
[21:45.220 --> 21:46.920]  It's the third highest earning one.
[21:47.740 --> 21:49.040]  Oh, in earnings? God, no.
[21:49.040 --> 21:51.180]  Yeah. No, not in goodness.
[21:52.340 --> 21:55.000]  So rank the alien films in order from best to worst right now, Gail.
[21:55.640 --> 21:57.760]  Best to worst? Yeah. Yeah.
[21:57.840 --> 21:59.760]  Go. Aliens, Alien.
[21:59.880 --> 22:01.060]  Yep. Romulus.
[22:04.940 --> 22:06.960]  Covenant. And then.
[22:10.880 --> 22:13.620]  You got to go Prometheus and then the Alien vs.
[22:13.760 --> 22:15.140]  Predators on the back end, right?
[22:16.800 --> 22:18.540]  I like Prometheus.
[22:19.380 --> 22:20.660]  I never saw it.
[22:23.080 --> 22:23.880]  It's fine.
[22:25.160 --> 22:27.120]  I thought it wasn't an alien movie.
[22:27.400 --> 22:29.840]  It's better if Covenant is already out.
[22:30.080 --> 22:32.240]  I think Covenant made Prometheus a bit better.
[22:32.900 --> 22:35.780]  Alien Romulus is the second highest grossing
[22:36.580 --> 22:38.480]  alien movie in history.
[22:39.440 --> 22:40.600]  Prometheus, number one.
[22:41.040 --> 22:43.920]  It goes Prometheus, then Romulus, then Aliens,
[22:44.540 --> 22:47.340]  then Alien vs. Predator, and then the original Alien.
[22:47.540 --> 22:49.640]  So Prometheus is an alien movie?
[22:50.300 --> 22:53.080]  Yeah. I thought one of them wasn't an alien movie.
[22:54.180 --> 22:54.980]  It is, but it's not.
[22:55.200 --> 22:56.260]  It is, but it's not.
[22:56.640 --> 22:57.760]  That's what people keep saying.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.220]  It's a prequel.
[23:01.000 --> 23:01.800]  Yeah. OK.
[23:02.460 --> 23:04.380]  Oh, but it has a xenomorph in it.
[23:05.260 --> 23:07.120]  Well, it's got some kind of alien.
[23:07.480 --> 23:08.660]  And it's got the space jockey.
[23:09.480 --> 23:11.440]  Yeah. So it's an alien movie.
[23:11.440 --> 23:12.600]  Yeah. Isn't it?
[23:12.660 --> 23:13.580]  Oh, yeah.
[23:13.740 --> 23:16.440]  I guess if you want to get technical in the fucking world of Alien,
[23:16.540 --> 23:19.680]  the xenomorph didn't exist yet, but the thing that becomes the xenomorph
[23:20.420 --> 23:22.040]  xenomorph is in that movie.
[23:24.440 --> 23:25.520]  The black goo.
[23:25.720 --> 23:27.540]  So why don't people just refer to it as a prequel?
[23:27.660 --> 23:29.620]  Why did people always say, well, it's not really an alien?
[23:29.700 --> 23:32.200]  I think people thought it was a direct prequel.
[23:32.380 --> 23:34.460]  I think all the stuff that they thought they were seeing,
[23:34.500 --> 23:35.800]  they thought was in Alien.
[23:36.720 --> 23:38.140]  Yeah, but it was different shit.
[23:38.700 --> 23:42.400]  I think people who like the Alien franchise this much are weird
[23:42.400 --> 23:45.880]  to begin with and are very protective of lore
[23:45.880 --> 23:48.660]  that the guy who made it does not care less about.
[23:48.840 --> 23:51.080]  Like he does not give a shit.
[23:51.160 --> 23:52.240]  And he just goes, yeah, I don't know.
[23:52.280 --> 23:53.860]  They're evil or they're good or something.
[23:54.020 --> 23:54.680]  And it's that's it.
[23:55.160 --> 23:57.700]  Ridley Scott has no respect for the Alien franchise.
[23:57.960 --> 23:59.580]  Zero. Zero. None.
[23:59.980 --> 24:01.660]  It's fantastic. I think it's great.
[24:02.460 --> 24:05.680]  Zero respect, but also like a weird amount of respect of like,
[24:05.680 --> 24:09.160]  no, we're going to explain what these things meant in the first movie.
[24:09.360 --> 24:10.080]  Yeah, it's like, what?
[24:10.440 --> 24:14.300]  It's so odd that he cares about it, but also doesn't seem to care at all.
[24:14.540 --> 24:16.440]  Yeah, right. The engineers are Jesus.
[24:18.180 --> 24:21.720]  Then your last few were The Forge, Slingshot and City of Dreams.
[24:21.940 --> 24:23.240]  Yeah, I have no memory of those.
[24:23.280 --> 24:25.440]  But man, The Forge was good value per point.
[24:25.580 --> 24:29.120]  Jesus, I don't know anything about those three movies.
[24:29.360 --> 24:31.920]  But yeah, one point for 27 million.
[24:31.920 --> 24:33.580]  The hell was Slingshot?
[24:34.920 --> 24:36.000]  No idea. 700 grand.
[24:36.600 --> 24:38.000]  What's The Forge?
[24:38.140 --> 24:39.660]  I just don't know what any of that stuff is.
[24:40.080 --> 24:43.520]  But, but it doesn't matter because you came in second.
[24:44.300 --> 24:50.460]  Because Andrew made over a billion dollars with his picks.
[24:51.480 --> 24:55.620]  Only five, only five movies.
[24:56.020 --> 24:58.220]  Wow. Solid core.
[24:58.880 --> 25:00.080]  Wait. Solid core.
[25:00.080 --> 25:05.040]  How did Wolverine and Deadpool do in comparison with Inside Out in total?
[25:06.980 --> 25:08.080]  Inside Out was on mine.
[25:08.640 --> 25:09.380]  Made more, I think.
[25:10.140 --> 25:11.360]  No, it's Nix's Inside Out.
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.960]  Inside Out 2 is Gavit's 600th.
[25:13.960 --> 25:14.620]  It made more.
[25:15.360 --> 25:16.800]  I had the highest grossing movie.
[25:17.360 --> 25:18.840]  Yeah. Damn it.
[25:18.920 --> 25:20.220]  And I still lost. Damn it.
[25:20.560 --> 25:22.400]  Yeah. Damn, it was so close.
[25:22.480 --> 25:22.860]  Look at that.
[25:23.620 --> 25:27.820]  I didn't realize that Inside Out 2 made more than Deadpool, Wolverine.
[25:27.880 --> 25:28.400]  That's crazy.
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.060]  I, it just make this, this whole thing just makes me hate Twisters even more.
[25:35.680 --> 25:36.640]  I'm with you, man.
[25:37.020 --> 25:38.560]  Absolutely. Absolutely.
[25:39.300 --> 25:43.740]  Look at that slow climb for Andrew, too, where it's like 91.
[25:44.440 --> 25:46.340]  Then you then it's 19.
[25:46.500 --> 25:48.700]  Fly Me to the Moon is you've gone a whole month here
[25:48.700 --> 25:52.520]  where Garfield comes out at the end of May and then you're going
[25:53.200 --> 25:54.600]  until almost what?
[25:54.700 --> 25:58.520]  Like late July until you have something that bangs on for you.
[25:58.560 --> 26:00.400]  And it, man, it it's hard.
[26:00.580 --> 26:02.580]  That's wild. Massive movie.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.700]  Yeah, it's it's sort of what in my experience with these games,
[26:06.700 --> 26:08.120]  I've done this more than you guys have.
[26:08.440 --> 26:12.400]  It is you want ideally one of those Deadpool and Wolverine.
[26:12.600 --> 26:15.760]  And then it's just about trying to get those things that really overperform
[26:15.760 --> 26:16.880]  like Twisters. Yeah.
[26:17.560 --> 26:20.320]  And that sort of range where it doesn't cost a ton of points.
[26:20.320 --> 26:22.940]  I wish it was already next summer so we could do it again.
[26:23.080 --> 26:24.600]  So do I. I'm excited.
[26:25.080 --> 26:27.160]  Yeah, the preview, what the next summer like?
[26:27.180 --> 26:29.040]  I have no idea what's supposed to come out.
[26:29.220 --> 26:30.060]  No, I'm coming summer.
[26:30.220 --> 26:31.780]  I think a bunch of stuff they're saying.
[26:32.220 --> 26:35.220]  I mean, if we play by football rules, Eric just got relegated.
[26:35.320 --> 26:37.560]  And then I think we have to bring someone up from the community.
[26:37.800 --> 26:38.420]  So what do you do?
[26:38.440 --> 26:41.520]  You just like bring Gracie in or something? Oh, yeah, great. Cool.
[26:42.260 --> 26:44.440]  No, that's not. That's not a suggestion.
[26:45.980 --> 26:47.240]  I want to play.
[26:47.240 --> 26:49.540]  Oh, Eric, we'll be back.
[26:49.700 --> 26:54.060]  And I don't know if you guys remember the prize for this thing, but for winning,
[26:54.260 --> 26:56.440]  I get to pick a watch along that we do.
[26:56.640 --> 26:59.880]  Oh, I already know what it's going to be.
[26:59.920 --> 27:00.720]  I got it in mind.
[27:00.760 --> 27:02.740]  I'm going to I'm going to sit on that for a little bit.
[27:02.820 --> 27:06.080]  We probably be we'll be watching something in November, December.
[27:06.820 --> 27:09.580]  Whoa. Do you think we'll do it with the Falcons or what?
[27:11.280 --> 27:12.700]  Uh, very possible.
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.200]  Sounds Christmas related.
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.760]  I will say, yeah, it is.
[27:16.760 --> 27:19.320]  It is a Christmas related film
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.640]  that I don't think I could get you guys to watch in any other context.
[27:23.800 --> 27:25.200]  But this jingle all the way.
[27:25.240 --> 27:27.820]  Jingle all the way. Jingle all the way to. Yeah. Yeah.
[27:29.020 --> 27:30.740]  I have a fondness for this movie.
[27:32.040 --> 27:33.080]  Right. Jingle all the way to.
[27:33.320 --> 27:35.760]  You think I like jingle all the way to you?
[27:35.760 --> 27:37.400]  Yeah, I think you're setting it up.
[27:37.400 --> 27:40.380]  So we are watching jingle all the way to you. Small soldiers.
[27:41.280 --> 27:45.620]  So if there was a small soldiers Christmas version, I'd be all about that.
[27:45.620 --> 27:47.280]  Jingle all the way to you.
[27:47.420 --> 27:48.160]  I haven't seen it.
[27:48.600 --> 27:49.640]  Maybe I do like it.
[27:49.680 --> 27:50.160]  I don't know.
[27:50.440 --> 27:51.800]  Is it Larry, the cable guy?
[27:51.940 --> 27:52.740]  The Santa Claus.
[27:53.500 --> 27:54.900]  It is Larry, the cable guy.
[27:55.080 --> 27:56.000]  Jingle all the way to.
[27:56.460 --> 27:59.000]  They already jingled all the way in the first movie.
[28:01.000 --> 28:01.800]  Still jingling.
[28:02.720 --> 28:04.240]  They jingled all the way to.
[28:04.420 --> 28:05.360]  But wait, there's more.
[28:07.120 --> 28:08.760]  Well, there there you have it.
[28:09.100 --> 28:12.240]  The summer movie auction, I think, was a success.
[28:12.380 --> 28:13.160]  It was a lot of fun.
[28:13.160 --> 28:16.380]  How did how did you do in the community?
[28:16.780 --> 28:19.060]  How how did your picks go with your friends?
[28:19.140 --> 28:22.220]  Let us know in the comments who won and what watch along movie
[28:22.220 --> 28:24.820]  you're going to make them watch with Larry, the cable guy this Christmas.
[28:25.060 --> 28:28.420]  I'm going to get my purple line tattooed on my arm.
[28:30.740 --> 28:32.420]  Whoa, that's pretty cool.
[28:34.120 --> 28:34.640]  Nerd.
[28:37.140 --> 28:39.620]  Well, thanks for doing this with us, Andrew.
[28:39.680 --> 28:42.260]  Thanks for introducing us to the summer movie auction.
[28:43.200 --> 28:46.040]  Yeah. Congratulations on your victory.
[28:46.340 --> 28:47.200]  Oh, thank you.
[28:47.620 --> 28:50.260]  I nobody believed in me, including myself.
[28:50.340 --> 28:52.120]  But we pulled it out at the end.
[28:52.260 --> 28:53.960]  We were all pretty sure you'd win it. It was your game.
[28:54.280 --> 28:55.680]  Yeah, no, there was.
[28:55.920 --> 28:59.580]  Listen, if you were looking at community posts, it was, oh, Gavin's got this
[28:59.580 --> 29:02.340]  locked up. Gavin's locked it in.
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.500]  He's got it. We're catching up.
[29:04.540 --> 29:06.360]  We're not the community. We're the show. Yeah.
[29:06.460 --> 29:07.980]  Oh, shit. Oh, yeah.
[29:08.220 --> 29:09.220]  This is the show.
[29:09.560 --> 29:10.380]  Yeah, there's a real difference.
[29:10.940 --> 29:14.000]  Do you think maybe next year, Eric will give himself a free movie?
[29:16.300 --> 29:17.860]  I should get two free movies.
[29:19.100 --> 29:21.240]  Who have I been doing all those podcasts with?
[29:24.280 --> 29:25.480]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[29:25.680 --> 29:28.780]  Let us know how you did and I'm excited for the next one.
[29:28.860 --> 29:31.220]  Bye. OK, bye. Bye. Bye.
[29:31.740 --> 29:32.440]  OK, bye.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.080]  I'm going to save my money this time.
