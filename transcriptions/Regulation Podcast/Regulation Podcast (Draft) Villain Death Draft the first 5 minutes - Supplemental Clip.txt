[00:00.000 --> 00:04.260]  Hello and welcome to a job that I was just rehired to do for some reason.
[00:04.420 --> 00:07.540]  Don't understand why, but we're doing a villain's death draft.
[00:07.900 --> 00:09.640]  Are they in movies? Are they in TV?
[00:09.920 --> 00:12.600]  You're going to have to find out and watch along with us.
[00:12.660 --> 00:16.480]  Also, thank you for supporting us because this is behind the paywall
[00:16.480 --> 00:21.820]  because we are we're watching copyrighted material in this clip.
[00:22.380 --> 00:24.380]  Why do you have to sound so creepy when you say it though?
[00:24.420 --> 00:26.100]  I don't know. My voice is dead.
[00:26.100 --> 00:27.680]  Also, why even call it out?
[00:27.680 --> 00:31.080]  Why even call out that like, guys, we're doing something illegal.
[00:31.840 --> 00:35.000]  Hey, guys, oh, maybe, you know.
[00:35.860 --> 00:38.540]  Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, let's call it out.
[00:38.620 --> 00:40.960]  So where did this where did this idea come from, Andrew?
[00:42.080 --> 00:47.020]  I just you know, I have a love of villains getting killed in ridiculous ways,
[00:47.020 --> 00:49.680]  and I feel like we all probably share this.
[00:49.800 --> 00:51.780]  And I just I seem like a good time.
[00:52.060 --> 00:53.860]  It's just like I want to see some dudes get killed.
[00:53.860 --> 00:57.440]  I feel like there's universal bloodlust amongst my friends.
[00:59.080 --> 01:01.340]  Revel in the blood.
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.240]  If you're going to put a villain in a movie, you might as well kill him in a great way.
[01:05.500 --> 01:09.040]  So I'm excited to see everyone's picks.
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.900]  Yeah, I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:11.140 --> 01:13.580]  But first, we need to figure out the draft order.
[01:13.900 --> 01:17.200]  That's I think I'm I'm most worried about my picks getting picked in this one.
[01:17.300 --> 01:18.240]  Of any draft we've done.
[01:18.800 --> 01:21.740]  Oh, yeah, there's going to be a lot of crossover.
[01:21.740 --> 01:22.860]  Oh, there's zero fear.
[01:22.860 --> 01:25.340]  I have one fear. Oh, wow.
[01:26.580 --> 01:28.620]  Did the dogs in the office die?
[01:28.640 --> 01:29.720]  Off the rails. Were they villains?
[01:30.500 --> 01:32.260]  Nope. Nope. Thank God.
[01:32.300 --> 01:34.060]  Callie and Joe Jr. are doing just fine.
[01:34.460 --> 01:36.580]  Good. OK. I mean, they're dead now.
[01:38.140 --> 01:40.260]  Probably. Yeah. Most likely. Yeah.
[01:41.220 --> 01:42.620]  But even fictionally, they're dead. Yeah.
[01:42.960 --> 01:43.620]  I assume. No longer.
[01:44.160 --> 01:46.920]  Kathy Bates character is probably dead as well. Oh.
[01:48.120 --> 01:49.800]  One order. Oh, my God.
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.720]  Why would the fictional version be dead in the office?
[01:54.860 --> 01:56.520]  The character she played is probably dead. Yeah.
[01:56.920 --> 01:58.320]  I don't know about that. I'll never know.
[01:58.460 --> 01:59.400]  Oh, that was a long time ago.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.160]  It was like 15 years ago.
[02:01.200 --> 02:03.500]  She is still alive as a person.
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.920]  So I don't know why her character would still be a fictional version of her
[02:06.920 --> 02:07.620]  would be dead.
[02:08.120 --> 02:09.940]  Michael Douglas just played Benjamin Franklin.
[02:10.120 --> 02:10.940]  He's still alive.
[02:11.440 --> 02:13.140]  But Benjamin Franklin's been dead for a long time.
[02:13.200 --> 02:14.840]  It can. But it was current day.
[02:15.100 --> 02:16.940]  Dummy. It was then.
[02:17.040 --> 02:18.640]  But you don't know what happened to that lady.
[02:18.640 --> 02:21.960]  That was you don't know how old she was in 2010 or 11 when that was.
[02:22.200 --> 02:23.400]  You don't know what she did to her body.
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.440]  You don't know how she treated herself.
[02:24.520 --> 02:26.280]  You don't have cancer runs in her family.
[02:26.560 --> 02:28.540]  You have no idea what her medical history was.
[02:28.600 --> 02:31.760]  I'm saying chances are she probably didn't make it.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.360]  We don't even know the order of the draft.
[02:33.500 --> 02:34.740]  We've had a dummy thrown out.
[02:35.960 --> 02:37.680]  I'm sick. Go ahead, Derek.
[02:38.000 --> 02:40.260]  So so I'm putting these in an egg order.
[02:40.480 --> 02:42.540]  We make always always an egg.
[02:42.660 --> 02:46.560]  I don't I always is something I don't trust with any of you guys, though.
[02:46.560 --> 02:50.140]  Like when you say always in the next time you go, you're the only one
[02:50.140 --> 02:51.360]  preventing the always.
[02:51.700 --> 02:54.620]  I don't I don't agree with that at all.
[02:54.960 --> 02:56.080]  How many times we randomizing?
[02:56.940 --> 02:58.040]  That's a great question.
[02:59.280 --> 03:00.440]  Why didn't you know?
[03:00.540 --> 03:02.180]  I thought we're doing this multiple times before.
[03:02.260 --> 03:03.140]  I think we could go higher.
[03:03.300 --> 03:04.100]  We go for a higher number.
[03:04.600 --> 03:06.400]  There's six of us. Let's just do six.
[03:08.180 --> 03:09.760]  OK. First randomization.
[03:11.360 --> 03:14.740]  Gracie, Nick, Gavin, Andrew, Eric, Geoff, second.
[03:16.560 --> 03:20.000]  Andrew, Nick, Gavin, Geoff, Gracie, Eric, don't like that one.
[03:21.420 --> 03:25.140]  Third, Nick, Andrew, Geoff, Mac, Gracie, Gavin.
[03:25.500 --> 03:27.340]  OK, it's fourth.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.180]  Nick, Geoff, Eric, Andrew, Gracie, Gavin.
[03:32.420 --> 03:34.120]  Here's a not a fan.
[03:35.340 --> 03:39.440]  Gavin, Geoff, no, and now.
[03:40.580 --> 03:45.520]  The sixth and final random to see the on now for villain death.
[03:47.520 --> 03:50.760]  Gavin, Geoff, Gracie, Nick, Eric, Andrew.
[03:52.900 --> 03:59.980]  Gavin, you are free to pick first in the death.
[04:00.540 --> 04:01.000]  Damn it.
[04:01.640 --> 04:02.440]  Well, OK.
[04:05.640 --> 04:06.760]  Nick, Eric.
[04:07.480 --> 04:08.240]  Feel free to do it.
[04:09.060 --> 04:10.000]  Well, I'm going to get my clip.
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.280]  We're locked in here. We're there. We got it.
[04:13.280 --> 04:20.120]  And now I think that some of us will present clips from our favorite deaths from villains.
[04:21.220 --> 04:24.940]  If you have it, you can drop it in the chat and I'll bring it up so we can all watch it together.
[04:25.200 --> 04:28.160]  But I think Gavin might have some of his own that he wants to share.
[04:29.320 --> 04:30.240]  Here's my stream.
[04:30.880 --> 04:34.160]  Oh, good.
[04:34.360 --> 04:34.920]  Oh, hold on.
[04:34.980 --> 04:37.340]  Let me get one off my list here.
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.000]  Hold on. Yeah, me too, baby.
[04:39.000 --> 04:39.940]  I think it's everyone.
[04:40.780 --> 04:42.640]  Maybe not Gracie, but everyone else.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.440]  I think this one was the most important draft to be a first pick because this one's going.
[04:48.460 --> 04:49.480]  This one's going first round.
[04:50.600 --> 04:53.040]  I understand drafts.
[04:53.300 --> 04:53.900]  You did it.
[04:55.420 --> 04:56.280]  Everyone watching?
[04:56.820 --> 04:57.820]  Yeah, I'm watching.
[05:00.860 --> 05:02.140]  It's the group.
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.100]  Oh, he's about to shoot them.
[05:05.340 --> 05:06.380]  Uh-oh, the watch.
[05:06.640 --> 05:07.880]  Oh, no.
[05:08.440 --> 05:12.980]  Now, a fun movie fact is that they counted to three but dropped him on two.
[05:13.120 --> 05:17.140]  I assume that's utter horseshit, but it's a fun fact to go along with this clip.
[05:17.160 --> 05:17.900]  That is a great fact.
[05:18.560 --> 05:22.700]  You know, another fact, both the fictional and real version of Alan Rickman are dead.
[05:23.260 --> 05:23.880]  That is true.
[05:24.260 --> 05:26.280]  Is that fun, that fact?
[05:26.760 --> 05:28.500]  Well, some of it is.
