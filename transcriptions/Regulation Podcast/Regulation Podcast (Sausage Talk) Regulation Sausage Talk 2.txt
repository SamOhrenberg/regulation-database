[00:00.000 --> 00:06.060]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Sausage Talk. This is our second Sausage Talk. I believe
[00:06.060 --> 00:09.780]  this is coming out at the end of January the 26th or so. You know that though because you're
[00:09.780 --> 00:14.300]  listening to it on that day. Or someday later if that's the case. You don't give a shit when
[00:14.300 --> 00:21.040]  it came out. It is about six months, Eric says almost to the day, since the last episode
[00:21.040 --> 00:27.080]  of Sausage Talk, which would make this episode two. We just wrapped the year on regulation.
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.700]  I figured it's a good time to probably talk about it. And we're opening up 2025. It's our first
[00:31.700 --> 00:37.980]  full year as a company moving forward. And we probably have a lot to figure out. We've been
[00:37.980 --> 00:42.800]  having sidebar conversations left and right all over the place. And I think we all agree it'd be
[00:42.800 --> 00:47.000]  better if we just got in the same room and hash some stuff out. Does anybody want to start?
[00:49.660 --> 00:53.680]  I'm imagining the sidebar conversations of what you guys are having. And then it's
[00:53.680 --> 01:00.440]  me just watching a kicking montage of martial arts films. I'm not in on the sidebar. So
[01:00.440 --> 01:04.820]  wherever you want to go, sounds good to me. Well, a lot of the sidebars are related to
[01:04.820 --> 01:11.300]  content that like we have a bunch of content that we've been pitching back and forth that we could
[01:11.300 --> 01:15.820]  kind of all go over together. I will say some of those some of the content we can't talk about in
[01:15.820 --> 01:22.240]  front of everybody. And that goes in like every direction. Right. So it's like not to usher in
[01:22.240 --> 01:27.340]  a new paranoid era or anything, but there are there are bits of content that we just can't
[01:27.340 --> 01:31.640]  discuss in front of all of us because some of us aren't aware of it, if that makes sense.
[01:32.020 --> 01:37.200]  If you had to summarize 2024 with regulation, what was it the year of?
[01:37.740 --> 01:45.780]  Absolute chaos. It was it was the year that regulation was was born like a phoenix falcon
[01:45.780 --> 01:53.820]  from the ashes of face. It was our phoenix falcon year. I'd say born, not necessarily
[01:53.820 --> 02:00.140]  fully taken off yet, like still process of it's not as easy as they make it look on TV to fly off
[02:00.140 --> 02:06.040]  majestically. I feel like still flapping them wings a little bit, still getting into the swing
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.880]  of things. There's a period where you're hopping around somebody's backyard to the tree for a
[02:11.880 --> 02:15.800]  couple of weeks, flying like three feet in the air, then a foot and then walking for a bit and
[02:15.800 --> 02:20.300]  then making it almost up to the limb and then fall. Yeah, we're we're I think we got to the
[02:20.300 --> 02:24.820]  lowest rung of the limb. We're not bouncing around the yard anymore. But yeah, we definitely have
[02:24.820 --> 02:31.000]  gone through that. We, you know, hold on a second. Yeah, my wings stretch out now. I feel like I
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.780]  can fly a little bit. A phoenix isn't real, right? Uh, so where do you? OK, hang on. This rocks.
[02:38.080 --> 02:41.780]  This is great. Where do you think a phoenix lives? Is it like the werewolves of New Mexico?
[02:41.880 --> 02:45.380]  Or where do you think a phoenix lives? I was thinking, yeah, I was thinking like a sandy
[02:45.380 --> 02:52.480]  climate. Sandy? Yeah, I think maybe because of Flight of the Phoenix, the movie that may have me
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.700]  thinking of sand. I associate a phoenix with fire and I associate fire with heat and ash and sand.
[02:59.860 --> 03:03.520]  So I'm right there with you. I think of a phoenix living in the desert. That's not a lot of fires
[03:03.520 --> 03:08.400]  in the desert there. You're just not out there. OK. Yeah. How often are you in the desert?
[03:08.400 --> 03:14.260]  When was the last time you visited the desert? I filmed in deserts. You also have to think
[03:14.260 --> 03:17.900]  maybe there were a lot of fires in the desert and that's why it's a desert.
[03:18.480 --> 03:24.300]  Oh, it's all ash. Yeah. I think the desert was at one time the wettest place and now it's the
[03:24.300 --> 03:28.440]  driest place. Something to think about, I guess. I don't even know where to begin with that.
[03:28.580 --> 03:36.060]  I don't think the desert was wetter than the other ocean. The what? Yeah, so we have a company
[03:36.060 --> 03:40.560]  now somehow. I think Gavin's saying it's not wetter. I think he's saying it was at best as
[03:40.560 --> 03:47.840]  wet. It was as wet. Yeah. Yeah. So listen, let's we're talking about fucking mythical creatures
[03:47.840 --> 03:55.920]  and fucking desert oceans. So it is mythical. OK. Yeah. Jesus Christ, guys. Yeah. We just
[03:55.920 --> 04:02.920]  seriously, though, we just we launched regulation on May 11th, 2024, and it is now January 17th.
[04:02.920 --> 04:10.200]  This comes out, whatever Eric said, the 26th. So we have a lot of a lot of company under our
[04:10.200 --> 04:16.280]  belt now. We successfully launched the product. The audience supported us overwhelmingly,
[04:16.560 --> 04:22.620]  the comment leavers and the regulation listeners of the world and have helped give us this this
[04:22.620 --> 04:27.660]  runway so that we can then build the company up and move forward. And we've been taking it in a very
[04:27.660 --> 04:35.760]  meticulous stair step approach. There is an extreme, I guess, urge to want to run out of
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.700]  the gate as fast as we can in a direction. And I think a lot of that comes from a from the enthusiasm
[04:42.220 --> 04:48.680]  of what we're doing, but be also we were running at full speed before. Yes. Shit the bed. Right.
[04:48.820 --> 04:54.760]  And so we there's a there's a there's a extreme urge to get back to that speed because we've
[04:54.760 --> 05:01.540]  already run at that speed as a podcast. And the hard thing for me has been and I don't know about
[05:01.540 --> 05:05.660]  y'all, but one of the hard things for me has been knowing that that's not the way to do it and that's
[05:05.660 --> 05:12.180]  not the right way to go and that we can't flip from face to regulation one to one. We have to now as
[05:12.180 --> 05:17.680]  an independent entity build the business behind regulation up so that it is healthy and that it
[05:17.680 --> 05:24.020]  can support us and the product going forward. And so I would say we are we're not running yet,
[05:24.020 --> 05:31.240]  but we're fucking I got my jogging pants on. Oh, that's how I feel. I feel like I'm stretching a
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.180]  lot. I've been getting into shape. I've been thinking about running a lot. You know, I
[05:35.180 --> 05:40.980]  subscribe to a fucking website. And so I get like a daily runner's tips, you know, and I bought a
[05:40.980 --> 05:46.220]  new pair of shoes and I've been wearing the jogging shorts around the house so that I get, you know,
[05:46.220 --> 05:49.380]  so they feel comfortable. So I'm ready. But I haven't I haven't gone outside and actually run
[05:49.380 --> 05:53.400]  yet. I feel like that's where we are. You're just dressed for it and you're stretching and stuff.
[05:53.400 --> 05:58.540]  You're just not actually doing that. I've eliminated every excuse to running at this point
[05:58.540 --> 06:02.480]  other than running. Right. I feel like that's where we are as a company. I do like that we've
[06:02.480 --> 06:08.640]  got pretty much to where we were content wise before it all went tits up. But we've not we've
[06:08.640 --> 06:13.080]  not got any of the bloat and it's just a very efficient machine right now. And it's nice that
[06:13.080 --> 06:19.220]  we've been baby stepping our dicks off instead of just good full tilt aimlessly. I totally agree.
[06:19.220 --> 06:23.500]  And listen, we're a we're a group of guys with baby dicks already. So it makes sense that we
[06:23.500 --> 06:30.100]  would baby step them. I think it's also just like we have a machine, but it's still figuring out
[06:30.100 --> 06:34.200]  the machine to be even more efficient. I think there's a lot of room for efficiency and just
[06:34.200 --> 06:38.360]  building off of what we've done so far. So that's something that we definitely should talk about
[06:38.360 --> 06:41.500]  today. And I would like to talk about today is efficiency and something that we've been
[06:41.500 --> 06:44.520]  and when I say we've been sidebar and stuff, a lot of the conversations I've been having
[06:44.520 --> 06:50.000]  just over the weekend when we were in Cancun and then just around town is just about like
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.200]  figuring out how to improve the efficiency and reduce the gap between when we release content
[06:56.200 --> 07:00.320]  from when we record it. Sometimes some content, some content, it doesn't matter. But there are
[07:00.320 --> 07:05.880]  there are pieces of content like we just put out the Snake Eyes unboxing, which was a great video.
[07:05.940 --> 07:10.680]  And I thought you did a great job editing it. But it was six months or so after we recorded it,
[07:10.680 --> 07:15.960]  maybe five. And I think the audience, one of the sentiments I saw was that like,
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.980]  oh, I completely forgotten about this. And that wasn't a negative comment, but
[07:18.980 --> 07:22.380]  I don't you know, I think that's something that we want to we want to avoid when possible,
[07:22.520 --> 07:28.240]  you know, like when you want to continue the bit while the bit is hot and fresh and matters.
[07:28.260 --> 07:32.320]  And so maybe we dive in there. I'd be happy with six weeks over six months.
[07:34.520 --> 07:38.900]  I think an interesting thing of figuring out where you're talking about, Geoff, like
[07:38.900 --> 07:43.320]  us taking flight or I feel like it's like we've put this car together and it's like,
[07:43.420 --> 07:46.600]  yeah, we can go. And then we realize, oh, fuck, we didn't we didn't put in a windshield.
[07:46.960 --> 07:52.140]  Like there are all these sort of like peripheral parts that are needed, but like we can drive
[07:52.140 --> 07:57.620]  without them. And then it's realizing once you're down the street of like, oh, we only put one
[07:58.440 --> 08:02.660]  rearview mirror in this thing. This is not. Oh, boy. OK, we got to figure that out.
[08:02.940 --> 08:07.800]  How many mirrors do you think a car has? One, but I couldn't remember the name for the thing
[08:07.800 --> 08:14.640]  you look for the left to the right. What are those called? The wing mirror. Sideview mirrors.
[08:14.880 --> 08:18.900]  Yeah. Sideview. Yeah, I can remember the name of that. I know there's only one.
[08:19.160 --> 08:23.000]  I mean, that is actually pretty fitting, though, because we do. I feel like an area that we've
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.880]  lost out on is we have slightly less organizational people, less eyes on it. So we have a lot of stuff
[08:28.880 --> 08:33.880]  recorded that just slips through the spreadsheet. And it's just like, oh, yeah, what happened to
[08:33.880 --> 08:38.580]  those Halloween GTA videos? It's just like they're just not on the list for some reason.
[08:38.960 --> 08:43.160]  So we end up having stuff that we completely forget about and remember later.
[08:43.380 --> 08:47.440]  I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of like Let's Play, because something that I don't
[08:47.440 --> 08:54.380]  know people may not have realized when we took over Let's Play, we at no point were ever less
[08:54.380 --> 08:59.800]  than two months ahead of schedule for everything. Correct. And we would slide things. But it was not
[08:59.800 --> 09:04.240]  the discussion of like, oh, wow, this is a few months old, did not apply. And I think it's
[09:04.240 --> 09:09.800]  just because we had a structure there that we don't currently have that I'd like to look into
[09:09.800 --> 09:15.400]  implementing, where essentially we make a piece of content, we throw it on the calendar and it's
[09:15.400 --> 09:20.320]  there. And if we move it or if we decide, like, you know what, this is more immediate, we're going
[09:20.320 --> 09:24.940]  to put it here. That action is also represented in, OK, well, where are we putting this then?
[09:24.940 --> 09:30.680]  It's so easy to be like, we we just did this. We're so excited about it. Let's get this out
[09:30.680 --> 09:35.780]  now. Oh, we're supposed to release this thing. It's from a game that's like three years old.
[09:35.980 --> 09:41.240]  It doesn't need to necessarily come. It's not like there's a rush to have gameplay of this type of
[09:41.240 --> 09:45.900]  thing. We'll just we'll put it out later and then we just kind of forget. And it's finalized. It's
[09:45.900 --> 09:52.080]  all done. It's just in the backlog. And I think having a more visual representation, I have a few
[09:52.080 --> 09:56.140]  we would use air table and I'd love to be able to something I've been meaning to look at
[09:56.140 --> 09:59.200]  a lot more within the past week, actually, but I just I've been sick.
[09:59.540 --> 10:04.780]  So my plan for this weekend specifically is to expand on that a little bit. How are you feeling
[10:04.780 --> 10:09.000]  today, by the way? Are you are you on the mend? Oh, I feel way better than I did. Yeah, I could
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.580]  tell yesterday when during a round of recordings that you had you had recovered to some degree
[10:13.580 --> 10:17.560]  because you had a lot of energy yesterday. You were kind of bouncing off the walls. It was great.
[10:17.560 --> 10:23.900]  Yeah, I listen. I crashed hard in the evening. There's a repercussion for that. But yeah,
[10:23.940 --> 10:29.580]  I'm feeling way better. And it's just it's been fun. As you said, like these are things we want
[10:29.580 --> 10:34.440]  to get more efficient at, but they're fun problems to have. Yeah. Like we can do better at this. How
[10:34.440 --> 10:39.620]  can we deliver this and make it more enjoyable for the audience? And also it's just as people
[10:39.620 --> 10:45.060]  that enjoy this work, it is a thing of like, oh, I really want to solve this. Like this is a thing
[10:45.060 --> 10:49.460]  I'm excited to brainstorm on. Can I fully blame someone for this problem, by the way?
[10:49.840 --> 10:53.320]  Yes. Nobody's stopping you. I'd like to blame Eric for this.
[10:55.520 --> 11:01.780]  Yeah, let's get into it. So I'm looking at the videos. No, everyone else. Everyone else. Shut
[11:01.780 --> 11:08.920]  up. Looking at the videos that we're that we're releasing for the stuff that we've shot and
[11:08.920 --> 11:14.640]  everything. Would love to get those off of Gavin's phone into an editor so that way we can get them
[11:14.640 --> 11:18.900]  a little bit more timely. They have been hanging out with the one person who said they're going
[11:18.900 --> 11:23.880]  to edit them. And I'm not blaming you for not having time, but I am blaming you for having
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.780]  them. So if you really wanted to hand them over, put them in a drive. I would love to get them to
[11:29.780 --> 11:34.260]  an editor. We could get them all out within probably six weeks. And then that would solve
[11:34.260 --> 11:39.620]  that problem in terms of the gameplay videos. I laid out what I wanted to do today, which was
[11:39.620 --> 11:45.340]  dump the backlog and just go forward with what we have for GTA and Gears. And I feel like I've
[11:45.340 --> 11:51.200]  really I feel like I've really laid out what I've wanted to do with a lot of this stuff. And that's
[11:51.200 --> 11:56.680]  all. Okay, wild. Well, I edit the I edit the videos as soon as they're scheduled in. I mean,
[11:56.820 --> 12:00.780]  if you if you're like, hey, let's put one out Sunday. It's edited for Sunday. It's ready. Hey,
[12:00.880 --> 12:06.100]  that's great to know. I've been waiting on you because I thought that I don't want to overload
[12:06.100 --> 12:10.920]  you by putting something on the schedule that you're not ready to edit. There is a fear of
[12:10.920 --> 12:16.860]  overloading Gavin that permeates. I of all the people that I work with, I am most fearful of
[12:16.860 --> 12:23.480]  putting more on you because I don't think that's fair to you for something that we've shot that
[12:23.480 --> 12:27.860]  way. Well, that's appreciated. But every every time we've needed one out, it's I've been clear
[12:27.860 --> 12:33.880]  if I have time or not. And I usually do. And they've all come up. Yeah. Well, I define clear.
[12:33.880 --> 12:37.740]  Yeah. I've been I've been managing you and working with you. Not that I manage you now,
[12:37.800 --> 12:41.880]  but I did for a while working with you for a long time. And your idea of clear and other people's
[12:41.880 --> 12:48.280]  idea of clear, I think might not necessarily line up perfectly in the Monday meetings.
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.580]  If we decide to put one out, I say whether I could do it. I think yes, every time so far.
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.400]  Give me your yes. There's like nine Gavin yeses and only two of them are yes.
[12:58.620 --> 13:02.960]  Yeah. I like I'll I'll take the blame for what we have. I have no problem with that.
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.100]  I've laid out what I want to do and whether you guys want to or not, that's up to you. I have no
[13:07.100 --> 13:13.820]  problem with that. I am very, very, very mindful of not asking more of you because your obligations
[13:13.820 --> 13:20.800]  are larger than the rest of us combined outside of this podcast. OK, well, you're being very fair
[13:20.800 --> 13:26.280]  and nice. You're being very fair and nice because I'm a I'm a very fair. I'm the nice one. I'm a
[13:26.280 --> 13:34.900]  very fair, nice person. You want to yeah. Yeah. No, you want to dump the backlog. This was absolutely
[13:34.900 --> 13:40.840]  wild. I don't want those videos. When we were talking about putting in a Thursday let's play
[13:40.840 --> 13:45.220]  or whatever, we would talk about a new slot. You were like, I don't want to start the new slot until
[13:45.220 --> 13:49.120]  we have the resources. We have more editors and I just want to get I just want to get a big backlog
[13:49.120 --> 13:54.700]  before we start putting stuff out. Two months later, delete the backlog. Sod the backlog. Well,
[13:54.700 --> 13:59.560]  the backlog is deceptive, Geoff. I don't think you were here for this. Oh, I probably wasn't. We have
[13:59.560 --> 14:05.300]  a deceptive backlog. Most of it, Andrew talked about, is mostly GTA and Gears. And so I'm saying
[14:05.300 --> 14:10.500]  get rid of the stuff that isn't that. Let's start fresh. And then now we have let's put out GTA and
[14:10.500 --> 14:15.600]  Gears. I think there's merit to what Eric's saying on a case by case basis. I don't want to flush an
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.840]  entire backlog, but I remember I've seen videos slip and stuff. And like there's a Sea of Thieves
[14:20.840 --> 14:25.860]  video we recorded while we were still at Rooster Teeth, probably that has never made it out. And I
[14:25.860 --> 14:30.180]  went back and looked at my footage and my footage isn't great. And it's like, does that do we need
[14:30.180 --> 14:34.840]  to put that Sea of Thieves video out or can we dump flush that and just record a new Sea of Thieves
[14:34.840 --> 14:40.500]  video? Right. If there's a problem with Wreckfest, is Wreckfest so hard to recreate that we could
[14:40.500 --> 14:44.800]  just make a new Wreckfest video that doesn't have footage problem? You know what I mean? Like I
[14:44.800 --> 14:48.960]  think we could take it in a we could be very I don't want to I don't know how granular we want
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.780]  to get in this sausage talk, but we could go down the list and just make a decision video by video
[14:54.780 --> 14:59.760]  carte blanching all of the GTA and all of the gears, because I understand those are the vast
[14:59.760 --> 15:04.160]  majority of our back catalog. But I do feel like there's a lot of weird one off videos that just
[15:04.160 --> 15:09.400]  maybe maybe don't need to come out. I think if the if the videos are just broken and junk beyond
[15:09.400 --> 15:13.380]  belief, like there's missing audio and missing video, then that makes sense. But I think we
[15:13.380 --> 15:18.220]  should look at them. I think what's important for me to clarify in this dumping of the backlog
[15:18.220 --> 15:23.300]  is just because we dump the backlog doesn't mean we're suddenly recent. I just want that
[15:23.300 --> 15:28.580]  communicated not to us. And I'm not talking just as like from an audience perspective of if we dump
[15:28.580 --> 15:33.880]  what we're talking about, we're still releasing GTA videos that we recorded five months ago.
[15:34.200 --> 15:38.580]  Like that doesn't that's not shifting. Correct. It's not like a sudden we're going to be timely
[15:38.580 --> 15:44.760]  on certain things. There's always going to be a delay. It is part of the size of our team and
[15:44.760 --> 15:50.740]  editors. We have at this at least in this current reality of what we are, that will be a byproduct
[15:51.580 --> 15:56.280]  of making stuff. Yeah. And this is the video game stuff is also just a portion of what we're doing,
[15:56.340 --> 16:00.500]  too. I don't want it to I want the pendulum to swing so far in the video game side discussion
[16:00.500 --> 16:03.840]  that we don't pay attention to the supplementals and the podcast and the other stuff that we're
[16:03.840 --> 16:07.280]  doing, too, because the video game stuff is just a portion of what we're doing. But it is, I think,
[16:07.300 --> 16:12.300]  the piece that we need to figure out the most, because it is next to recording the podcast
[16:12.300 --> 16:17.360]  itself, the easiest thing for us all to record together from home. It also becomes of like
[16:17.360 --> 16:22.740]  releasing the backlog. We have a bunch of Gears of War videos and we have a bunch of GTA videos
[16:22.740 --> 16:27.960]  and the GTA videos like we can release those. That's not really a problem. We've set a precedent
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.640]  on the Gears of War ones that they are at a certain tier. So then it becomes a question
[16:32.640 --> 16:39.180]  of like, even if we edited all of those, do we consecutively release 16 Gears videos?
[16:39.180 --> 16:43.280]  You understand what I mean? Like it causes there's a separate problem that needs to be solved in that
[16:43.280 --> 16:49.680]  scenario of what happens when one of these long form things ends up being tied to specific content
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.760]  here on our Patreon. Like what is the workaround to that? Do we remove it from that tier? Welcome
[16:55.760 --> 17:01.200]  to our new show, Years of Gears, where every week we release a new Gears of War video until we've
[17:01.200 --> 17:06.660]  played every Gears of War video. That's just another thing to think of as far as scheduling.
[17:06.660 --> 17:11.460]  So it's not even sometimes in the scenario in which we have it all put together and edited,
[17:11.480 --> 17:18.560]  it then becomes a thing of us having to be really thoughtful on what we label as what type of
[17:18.560 --> 17:25.200]  exclusivity. And then is there ever a scenario in which that exclusivity changes? Like my gut
[17:25.200 --> 17:31.360]  instinct to that is no, but at the same like we're 17 in, so it's like I could see people being,
[17:31.360 --> 17:38.300]  hey, I pay for extra medium. I don't necessarily want my video to be a Gears video every week.
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.280]  It wouldn't replace something that we already do for that tier, though. I think we were talking
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.280]  about having a slot that's just like a series slot. Yeah, we have, but we have released it
[17:48.280 --> 17:54.380]  in that context of this is the extra medium of that month. I think we keep it in the same tier,
[17:54.400 --> 17:59.860]  but it can be in a new slot. I think those slots are great for one offs and also for us to test
[17:59.860 --> 18:04.740]  stuff with the Patreon members to see what sticks and what they like. And then if they latch on to
[18:04.740 --> 18:10.480]  something that we can peel it off into its own slot behind the behind the Patreon wall, whatever
[18:10.480 --> 18:15.620]  it's called, and do it that way. Right. Like it could almost be like an incubator slot, because I
[18:15.620 --> 18:20.760]  agree if I'm if I don't give a fuck about video games, I just like the podcast and I like drafts
[18:20.760 --> 18:25.580]  and I like rankings and I love blindsides and that kind of stuff in the watch alongs that I'm
[18:25.580 --> 18:29.560]  going to I might be a little miffed if all I get for the next six months is a Gears award video
[18:29.560 --> 18:34.060]  in that slot. Right. I don't want to do that for sure. Yeah, I think we should still look up
[18:34.060 --> 18:40.160]  Patreon supplementals as a continuing thing. And any long term series, like if we do a weekly
[18:40.160 --> 18:44.280]  Gears until all those videos are out, that would be an additional. Yeah, that makes sense. I think
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.780]  I think that just go ahead. Go ahead. I was just going to say in the context in which we're
[18:48.780 --> 18:52.440]  describing that then becomes a thing of we need another editor for that. Yeah. And that's just
[18:52.440 --> 18:56.120]  something on our end that we need to be mindful of. Let's get one. I think the nice thing about
[18:56.120 --> 19:01.060]  it is, is that we I was looking at the numbers. We do make a little bit of money off YouTube,
[19:01.160 --> 19:06.700]  but it's dog shit compared to everything else. Right. Yeah. And so the idea that we would have
[19:06.700 --> 19:13.360]  to release any content in a way that makes sense for YouTube is out the window to me. So if we
[19:13.360 --> 19:17.860]  wanted to like like I'm just throwing this out there more for the audience to we can be flexible
[19:17.860 --> 19:22.660]  with a lot of the stuff we do if it's a series like Gears is a bad example because behind the
[19:22.660 --> 19:28.480]  paywall. But I wouldn't be opposed to releasing five videos in one week on YouTube and two the
[19:28.480 --> 19:32.500]  next week if that's the way it works out for us, if that's the way it makes the most sense for the
[19:32.500 --> 19:36.100]  content. You know, I don't want a monkey. I want people to know when they can come and expect
[19:36.100 --> 19:41.800]  content. But I also feel OK with with releasing stuff whenever the fuck we want to, if it makes
[19:41.800 --> 19:47.420]  sense for the content and not because we're not playing an algorithm game anymore. Sure. Totally.
[19:47.420 --> 19:52.860]  That's sort of the joy and like one of the things that is so amazing about us being supported on
[19:52.860 --> 19:57.560]  Patreon. And that is something that I bring up to remind myself because I keep forgetting that
[19:57.560 --> 20:01.460]  because we did it. I did it the other way for so long. You got to keep like I'll be looking at
[20:01.460 --> 20:04.760]  YouTube analytics and be like for like 20 minutes and be like, oh, wait, this doesn't really matter.
[20:05.100 --> 20:09.160]  Why do I give a fuck? This isn't. Yeah, this isn't where my audience is. This isn't where
[20:09.160 --> 20:12.680]  they're supporting us, you know, so just something to keep looking. We've been doing it the other way
[20:12.680 --> 20:15.920]  for so long. It's just a good thing to remind yourself pretty constantly. I'm not worried
[20:15.920 --> 20:20.260]  about the analytics of it or whatever. It's just that I think when we start getting off track
[20:21.080 --> 20:25.360]  with upload dates and everything and it gets screwy, I think it messes with the audience's
[20:25.760 --> 20:31.260]  expectation of when they can come in and get the thing that they want on what day. And I think when
[20:31.260 --> 20:36.120]  I think when we start messing with people's schedules and everything, I think we're I think
[20:36.120 --> 20:40.120]  we're doing ourselves a disservice. I think that I think we're not doing I don't think we're doing
[20:40.120 --> 20:44.000]  the best for us. I think we're just going we have a bunch of videos. That's why I want to kill a
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.020]  backlog. I don't want to mess with schedules either. I guess I wasn't saying like when we talk
[20:49.020 --> 20:55.660]  about adding stuff, it's almost always additive. It's very rarely are we replacing. And so that's
[20:55.660 --> 21:00.920]  kind of why I wanted to do the weekly and I suggested we do the Monday GTA again. I think
[21:00.920 --> 21:05.820]  it's also I think people have an affection for that time slot from years ago, some of the some
[21:05.820 --> 21:10.140]  of the audience. So I think it kind of appeals to them too. But it also adds a little bit of that
[21:10.140 --> 21:15.000]  structure. But I just I guess I was thinking if we wanted to dump we had a tranche of like eight
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.260]  videos that we were holding onto for no reason. If we wanted to dump them all at once, we could.
[21:18.560 --> 21:21.900]  I'm not saying we should. I'm not saying that's the best way to do it. But I'm saying I guess I
[21:21.900 --> 21:26.560]  care less about this stuff than than I did previously. I'm more interested in just putting
[21:26.560 --> 21:29.780]  out in the way that makes the most sense for us and the audience and the content itself.
[21:29.980 --> 21:33.580]  I think there's all sorts of solutions to of even if it's just like, hey,
[21:34.020 --> 21:38.620]  these videos only live on Patreon and it's called like an opening of the vault or something.
[21:38.620 --> 21:42.360]  Yeah, there's all sorts of ways we can handle it. I mean, we can dump it.
[21:42.820 --> 21:43.520]  Dregs Tuesday.
[21:44.380 --> 21:50.240]  Dregs Tuesday. I will say one thing that I've personally missed and it's just it's one of the
[21:50.700 --> 21:55.600]  things of like it's the windshield thing of building the car we used to do every month on
[21:55.600 --> 21:59.720]  our schedule. We would have an office day and that sometimes would be live action stuff.
[21:59.840 --> 22:04.120]  But a lot of the times it was remote and it would end up being like drafts and it would be
[22:04.120 --> 22:09.900]  a day every month where we recorded like four or five drafts in a day. And I really miss having
[22:09.900 --> 22:15.820]  that cadence of supplemental on the schedule. And I wanted to float by you guys because we
[22:15.820 --> 22:20.620]  have a Thursday let's play day where we record most of our stuff in that time frame. I'd love
[22:20.620 --> 22:26.340]  like a Friday like draft day or just supplement like audio supplemental day to focus on the other
[22:26.340 --> 22:30.540]  stuff. I think that's a great idea. I'm right there with you, Andrew. I missed that as well.
[22:30.540 --> 22:35.420]  Like one of my favorite days ever recording was when we recorded I don't remember what all three
[22:35.420 --> 22:40.160]  were but we did the it was the day we did the mall draft and we just went back to back to back and
[22:40.160 --> 22:44.100]  every draft felt so different and had totally different energy. And it was just like it was
[22:44.100 --> 22:48.520]  it just felt like really accomplished knocking them all out in the same day. And I like doing that.
[22:48.780 --> 22:53.300]  I think that was a great format for recording. But we also need to be careful not to just shit
[22:53.300 --> 22:57.680]  stuff out in that slot if we can't if there's nothing planned. I feel like we could easily
[22:57.680 --> 23:00.780]  not do the recording. We don't have to quickly be like, oh, come up with something.
[23:01.200 --> 23:05.940]  I totally agree. But I feel like we're in a point right now with like drafts and stuff
[23:05.940 --> 23:09.860]  where we have like 60. Yeah. That we're like, yeah, that sounds great. We should do that.
[23:10.100 --> 23:13.440]  And then we just don't have that built in mechanism right now of actually doing it.
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.320]  Yeah. I mean, I'm sure that won't happen for a while. But if it's like Thursday evening,
[23:17.340 --> 23:21.980]  we're like, oh, what should we do tomorrow? I feel like if it's not forced, it's a lot better.
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.180]  Yeah, totally. And I think that's the idea of I mean, the flexibility. If we don't have anything
[23:26.180 --> 23:30.780]  to record, we don't need to record. We cancel it. But we also have the sheets document that
[23:30.780 --> 23:36.180]  Eric created and that I populated over the holiday. And it's like 28 ideas in it now,
[23:36.260 --> 23:40.280]  too, that it's like if we're ever hurting for something to do, we could look at that.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.540]  And there's a ton of stuff that we've identified that we
[23:43.100 --> 23:46.260]  really want to do at some point that we just haven't made it through yet.
[23:46.580 --> 23:50.740]  Yeah, I think that'd be great. I think we are at a point where we could have a new editor
[23:51.180 --> 23:55.860]  dedicated to a specific series that you could potentially just have a GTA editor.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.660]  And whenever he's finished or she's finished, start downloading the next one. And they'll
[24:00.660 --> 24:03.140]  always just be one of those ready to go or maybe with gears or something.
[24:03.500 --> 24:05.440]  That's sort of what I have going right now.
[24:05.640 --> 24:06.840]  Do you have a new person?
[24:07.180 --> 24:12.140]  Not a new person. It's just they are rotational like they've got a lot of other stuff going on.
[24:12.180 --> 24:17.460]  So I like to be able to somebody we worked at with at Let's Play. I named Sean. They've
[24:17.460 --> 24:22.380]  done a majority of our GTA 5 stuff, just like coincidentally. And I recently reached out to
[24:22.380 --> 24:27.760]  them like late last week saying, hey, we have a bunch of these GTA videos. It'd be awesome if
[24:27.760 --> 24:32.100]  you could just like focus in on these for us and just hammer them out so we could start
[24:32.100 --> 24:35.220]  releasing them with some more regular cadence.
[24:35.440 --> 24:37.220]  That's something I don't think we've actually ever talked about
[24:37.220 --> 24:42.540]  within our own company is that you handle all of the post interaction.
[24:43.020 --> 24:43.060]  Yeah.
[24:43.460 --> 24:44.060]  And he does great.
[24:45.320 --> 24:46.080]  Thanks, Nick.
[24:46.120 --> 24:46.780]  No, it's for real.
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.920]  It's so efficient, so helpful and efficient.
[24:50.240 --> 24:53.660]  Yeah, Nick. Nick is absolutely right. You're very, very good at it.
[24:53.780 --> 24:58.400]  Like from from finding the people to like making the intro to getting them the footage
[24:58.400 --> 25:01.820]  and then delivering us the edited video. You just you just do it all.
[25:01.920 --> 25:04.580]  And here's the other thing. Making sure they get paid.
[25:04.760 --> 25:04.940]  Yeah.
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.700]  Seeing it through on the back end.
[25:06.860 --> 25:06.980]  Oh, yeah.
[25:07.080 --> 25:11.560]  Making sure that everything is done in like an administrative way.
[25:11.700 --> 25:16.360]  Andrew is taking care of all that stuff for like this video game post stuff. It's fantastic.
[25:16.360 --> 25:22.360]  And I don't know how you're so competent at that when you can barely start a game lobby.
[25:26.460 --> 25:29.300]  Oh, man.
[25:30.300 --> 25:32.680]  Or the status of your computer altogether.
[25:33.180 --> 25:33.700]  Yes.
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.260]  The fact that you do that with your pile of shit is unbelievable.
[25:39.840 --> 25:43.940]  Well, we have a Q&A that, you know, part of our Patreon membership thing
[25:43.940 --> 25:48.980]  is that Falcons, I believe, can leave questions to be answered during sausage talks.
[25:49.700 --> 25:52.320]  I reset my computer at like five a.m. multiple times because I'm like,
[25:52.340 --> 25:55.720]  I need to be able to write these down and I don't need it to freeze.
[25:55.900 --> 26:00.960]  Like I need my runway for my Mac is like, if it's chunking, we're going to we need six hours.
[26:01.640 --> 26:03.040]  Is it squinkle chunking?
[26:03.380 --> 26:07.700]  It's oh, as soon as we're done this recording, I'm heading to see if I can get some.
[26:07.880 --> 26:10.240]  I better go get some, too. I just remember it's on my schedule.
[26:10.340 --> 26:10.820]  It's a chunk.
[26:10.820 --> 26:16.680]  I think a thing that we can afford now, too, is and Nick needs this also,
[26:16.900 --> 26:21.240]  is we use new machines so we can keep up with what we need to do,
[26:21.240 --> 26:24.700]  because that's not something we were able to do when we were a glass company.
[26:24.760 --> 26:28.120]  Like that was, you know, the budget and what we were doing or whatever.
[26:28.680 --> 26:30.000]  There was no hope for that.
[26:30.060 --> 26:34.440]  But we have a company where and I don't know if people know how this stuff works
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.600]  or whatever, where it is like when you get this money, X amount needs to be spent.
[26:39.600 --> 26:44.560]  So that way, like it's not taxed to hell and everything like that's the point of having
[26:44.560 --> 26:46.620]  a bank account with like this company.
[26:46.800 --> 26:51.400]  And so when we look at this stuff, we need to buy machines for you guys, especially you.
[26:51.620 --> 26:56.820]  But before we do that, we definitely need to see if Gavin can figure out your tech support needs.
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.620]  Yes, which I want to do desperately.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.100]  Oh, it'll be so funny.
[27:01.640 --> 27:03.120]  Yeah, not at all.
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.980]  Like, I don't mean this in a disparaging way for where we were working previously.
[27:06.980 --> 27:11.460]  But when I was I just sort of ended up as the head of Let's Play for that.
[27:12.300 --> 27:16.220]  And we had an issue where Eric and Nick were on last generation consoles.
[27:16.340 --> 27:16.900]  Yeah, we were.
[27:17.140 --> 27:19.540]  And it would cause some problems.
[27:19.640 --> 27:20.140]  Yeah, it did.
[27:20.220 --> 27:24.140]  And it was the thing of vocalizing of, hey, it would be it'll be really nice to buy
[27:24.140 --> 27:28.220]  some current gen systems that cost like three hundred dollars.
[27:28.380 --> 27:31.560]  And that not being a thing that was immediate that that are like
[27:31.560 --> 27:36.100]  we needed to build a justifiable case as to why we needed this.
[27:36.100 --> 27:39.160]  And it was just a thing of like, oh, oh, God, like
[27:39.600 --> 27:43.000]  this is a six hundred dollar purchase for the Let's Play channel.
[27:43.140 --> 27:49.140]  Almost all of the equipment I've had over the last six years I bought personally
[27:49.140 --> 27:52.400]  because I just couldn't deal with trying to get it purchased through the company.
[27:52.500 --> 27:53.000]  Oh my God, same.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  Yeah, especially if it's stuff I can find use for in my other line of work.
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.060]  I would just went ahead and just pay for stuff myself because going through all that shit.
[28:02.060 --> 28:06.240]  I also find it funny that Andrew is our person who handles all the post.
[28:06.580 --> 28:10.440]  I like that he doesn't watch or proof anything, though.
[28:10.960 --> 28:13.260]  As soon as it's delivered, it's back on us.
[28:13.960 --> 28:16.280]  And because you because you hate listening to the stuff we're in, right?
[28:16.520 --> 28:17.100]  Or you're in.
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.740]  I just think I'm such a bad like I know sort of what I'm good at and what I'm bad at.
[28:22.040 --> 28:24.860]  I am so bad at determining if a thing is bad or good
[28:25.400 --> 28:31.760]  in the way that like you have such a clear editor's vision of like how things should move.
[28:32.200 --> 28:36.660]  I don't know how to say this in any other way, but I am way too content with things being boring.
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.380]  Like my tolerance for boring is too high.
[28:39.520 --> 28:40.240]  I feel the same way.
[28:40.340 --> 28:41.340]  I just don't.
[28:41.520 --> 28:42.420]  I'm so fine with it.
[28:42.780 --> 28:43.920]  Like I'm with you.
[28:44.100 --> 28:46.320]  Like I'll watch it and I'll go like, oh, this is nice.
[28:46.360 --> 28:47.700]  Like this is, you know, we're just hanging out.
[28:47.740 --> 28:48.500]  It's kind of a vibe.
[28:48.580 --> 28:49.260]  It has a feel.
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.780]  And then you will have and be with like a scalpel.
[28:52.120 --> 28:54.700]  And then it'll it'll be so much better.
[28:54.780 --> 28:55.980]  Whatever your version is.
[28:56.020 --> 29:00.060]  After it's gone through those notes that I just go, I just I have no value here.
[29:00.120 --> 29:00.740]  I don't know how to do.
[29:00.740 --> 29:05.680]  Andrew, you've totally I've never been able to articulate how I feel when I get stuff
[29:05.680 --> 29:08.580]  back for notes where I watch it and I go, yes, yes, it's fine.
[29:08.680 --> 29:09.180]  We're hanging out.
[29:09.260 --> 29:09.680]  We're doing this.
[29:09.820 --> 29:12.280]  Like I don't give a shit.
[29:12.420 --> 29:17.640]  And then Gavin comes in and to say that he makes it 10 times better is an understatement,
[29:17.640 --> 29:21.760]  probably because it is always better after a round of Gavin notes.
[29:21.880 --> 29:22.700]  Always, always.
[29:22.840 --> 29:27.700]  I try to keep it at no more than like two rounds, though, like very rarely am I watching
[29:27.700 --> 29:29.380]  the second or third version of anything.
[29:29.380 --> 29:34.620]  But I feel like editing because I've probably edited a thousand videos in my life.
[29:34.720 --> 29:39.220]  I feel like that's been the most helpful thing for me in terms of then turning around and
[29:39.220 --> 29:42.340]  creating the content, at least just having something in the back of my mind where I'm
[29:42.340 --> 29:44.720]  like, oh, that'll be fine because of this in the edit, blah, blah, blah.
[29:44.860 --> 29:47.800]  I feel like those moments are helpful when when I'm actually recording.
[29:48.280 --> 29:48.380]  Totally.
[29:48.680 --> 29:49.440]  And it shows.
[29:49.720 --> 29:49.900]  Yeah.
[29:50.280 --> 29:54.280]  I think for me, when I'm making stuff, it's more of like, does this feel good in the moment?
[29:54.820 --> 29:56.640]  I'm sure we'll have enough to make something of it.
[29:56.640 --> 29:58.420]  I don't have anywhere.
[29:58.560 --> 29:59.380]  I don't think I ever will.
[29:59.500 --> 30:04.960]  I think if I focus on editing the rest of my life, I would never have as clear of a
[30:04.960 --> 30:10.200]  vision as you do in terms of like what is actually needed for this thing to be the best
[30:10.200 --> 30:10.980]  version of itself.
[30:11.100 --> 30:11.440]  Interesting.
[30:11.520 --> 30:12.820]  It's a very impressive skill that you have.
[30:12.860 --> 30:16.200]  I feel like most of my notes, though, are, hey, we're talking about this.
[30:16.600 --> 30:17.460]  Cut to it.
[30:17.940 --> 30:23.000]  Or if I remember if I remember from my own footage, sometimes I'm like, oh, you know,
[30:23.000 --> 30:27.920]  that bit where Eric fell off the roof way funnier from this other person's angle than
[30:27.920 --> 30:28.760]  his own angle.
[30:28.860 --> 30:33.940]  Like a lot of the stuff in gameplay, it looks a lot funnier from another viewpoint than
[30:33.940 --> 30:35.740]  your own, especially if you get killed.
[30:36.080 --> 30:41.220]  I feel like as a rule, we try to give editor those notes in the content when it happens,
[30:41.240 --> 30:42.620]  like, oh, that looks so much better from my angle.
[30:42.680 --> 30:43.480]  Cut to that, you know?
[30:43.580 --> 30:44.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:44.340 --> 30:46.240]  Like we try to help the editors out in that regard, too.
[30:46.440 --> 30:50.480]  My favorite example of this is, you know, I was in a majority of the Let's Play stuff
[30:50.480 --> 30:51.240]  we did at Rooster Teeth.
[30:51.240 --> 30:54.500]  There was one video I wasn't where Geoff and Gavin did a bum bait.
[30:54.640 --> 30:55.700]  I was like, this is great.
[30:55.760 --> 30:58.640]  Like, I get to just watch this as a fan of this content.
[30:58.820 --> 30:59.760]  This is a man.
[30:59.900 --> 31:00.600]  What a time.
[31:01.000 --> 31:03.300]  And so I watched it and I was like, that was great.
[31:03.360 --> 31:04.000]  No notes.
[31:04.400 --> 31:09.060]  And then Gavin came in and he had all these notes of like what should be trimmed and where.
[31:09.220 --> 31:13.040]  And then I watched his take of it and went, oh, no, this is yeah, this is great.
[31:13.600 --> 31:16.980]  Like this is so much better in a way that I would have even known.
[31:17.040 --> 31:20.060]  Like I had no concept that there was better to be.
[31:20.060 --> 31:24.480]  I remember that there was like a game that ended early because everyone dropped out
[31:24.480 --> 31:26.340]  that I just cut entirely.
[31:26.700 --> 31:30.960]  And then there was like a 15 second silent gap as we were waiting between games.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.560]  And I was just like, we could just lose stuff like that, because I feel like if people have
[31:34.560 --> 31:38.120]  these videos on in the background, sometimes they'll wonder if they just stopped playing
[31:38.120 --> 31:39.360]  and we could just cut those moments.
[31:39.420 --> 31:39.740]  Yes.
[31:39.940 --> 31:43.200]  I had something kind of like that happen at Rooster Teeth once when I was the creative
[31:43.200 --> 31:47.480]  director and I proofed a trailer for a show that was coming out.
[31:47.480 --> 31:51.760]  And I had like three notes, but otherwise I was like, yeah, it's pretty good.
[31:52.100 --> 31:56.200]  And then Jordan got a hold of it and the notes came back.
[31:56.280 --> 31:59.540]  It was like a novel of notes of why this was a bad trailer.
[32:00.380 --> 32:02.220]  And I thought, man, I really like that trailer.
[32:02.340 --> 32:05.140]  And then I read all of his notes and I went like, I hate that fucking trailer.
[32:05.280 --> 32:06.240]  He's totally right.
[32:06.560 --> 32:09.660]  And you realize it was so stupid in that moment.
[32:09.920 --> 32:13.440]  Like, why did I not see all these 11 things that he saw?
[32:13.760 --> 32:15.820]  You know, it's all different perspectives, isn't it?
[32:15.840 --> 32:16.240]  Exactly.
[32:16.540 --> 32:16.800]  Exactly.
[32:16.800 --> 32:22.100]  I think that's why we work so well too, because we're, I think we're willing to
[32:22.100 --> 32:25.860]  give the notes if we need to or whatever, or know where we're strong and where we're not
[32:25.860 --> 32:27.700]  to like do that stuff.
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.060]  I could never hope to give the notes that Gavin gives because I just go,
[32:31.200 --> 32:32.280]  I never even thought about that.
[32:32.300 --> 32:35.060]  Like Andrew's saying, like, I just don't, I'm not wired that way.
[32:35.120 --> 32:36.660]  Like, that's just not where my brain is.
[32:36.700 --> 32:38.180]  And, uh, I don't know.
[32:38.240 --> 32:41.040]  It's pretty special to see, but then Gavin will come in and he's like,
[32:41.060 --> 32:44.040]  hey, let's do this video where I just edited, like by yourself.
[32:44.040 --> 32:49.220]  You just went, I'm going to edit this 25 minute video of us playing GTA.
[32:49.600 --> 32:50.880]  And it's so cinematic.
[32:51.100 --> 32:53.500]  And it was like, this is an Xbox 360 game.
[32:53.520 --> 32:54.580]  And this looks like fucking crazy.
[32:54.580 --> 32:55.660]  It's like, it's gorgeous.
[32:55.980 --> 33:00.240]  And it's like, I never would have thought to make something that looks like this.
[33:00.320 --> 33:04.180]  I've never had a love for like the edit aspect.
[33:04.180 --> 33:06.060]  Like you make a movie, you make it three times.
[33:06.100 --> 33:08.560]  You're making it in pre, you're making it like in production.
[33:08.620 --> 33:09.460]  You're making it in post.
[33:09.700 --> 33:11.520]  I don't have the love for post.
[33:11.680 --> 33:13.080]  Gavin is so good at it.
[33:13.080 --> 33:16.240]  So, so, so good at it.
[33:16.380 --> 33:16.820]  It's great.
[33:17.080 --> 33:19.500]  Yeah, a few years ago, I learned how to use the Rockstar editor,
[33:19.680 --> 33:23.860]  like keyframing camera angles and just making like little cinematic things.
[33:24.320 --> 33:26.160]  And then I was never able to use it in content.
[33:26.800 --> 33:30.760]  I did actually record a bunch of game replays for Achievement Hunter,
[33:30.820 --> 33:34.880]  but I never got the go ahead to make it into a video that we all did.
[33:35.260 --> 33:38.160]  But now, something I like about this format, though, is that
[33:38.160 --> 33:42.220]  I can just make stuff and try it with you guys and see if it works.
[33:42.220 --> 33:44.600]  And everyone's kind of OK with that experimental style.
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.460]  Yes, 100 percent.
[33:46.560 --> 33:51.280]  I think it is such a I don't know what the word advantageous or just
[33:51.280 --> 33:54.460]  it is a thing I appreciate so much about all of you
[33:54.460 --> 33:57.940]  that everyone has an absolute willingness to try whatever.
[33:58.540 --> 34:00.760]  Yes, and it doesn't necessarily mean it will work.
[34:00.780 --> 34:06.400]  But just like not having that hurdle of trying to just get the thing made,
[34:06.480 --> 34:10.300]  like we can make the thing and then learn if it's good after the fact and we can move on.
[34:10.300 --> 34:12.340]  Yeah, it is so nice.
[34:12.440 --> 34:17.120]  Because even if we burn an hour of all our time, it's, you know, five hours spent.
[34:17.320 --> 34:20.220]  But I feel like a lot of the time, even if it's not something we would put out
[34:20.220 --> 34:22.020]  or not something that works in this iteration,
[34:22.220 --> 34:24.400]  we can make something from it or build on it.
[34:24.420 --> 34:26.060]  And it just wasn't a waste of time.
[34:26.180 --> 34:30.840]  It is so nice. God, let me tell you, man, it is you talk about how nice that is.
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.500]  Given my previous role in the company, that was the thing that I probably had to learn
[34:37.500 --> 34:42.900]  to get the best at that I didn't enjoy doing at all, which you would assume that
[34:42.900 --> 34:46.240]  because I was a founder that they would make everything I wanted to make.
[34:46.360 --> 34:48.160]  But that's not how that shit works at all.
[34:48.720 --> 34:52.560]  In some ways, I think that it works the opposite of that at some point.
[34:52.780 --> 34:58.260]  But you have to get really good at selling an idea to people.
[34:58.280 --> 35:01.640]  When you have an idea, I had to get really good at selling it to the Achievement Hunter guys
[35:01.640 --> 35:05.920]  and getting them on board and then selling it to whoever management was at the time
[35:05.920 --> 35:07.560]  and getting them on board to give us money.
[35:07.720 --> 35:10.620]  And you're having to do one sheets, and you're having to do pitch docs,
[35:10.680 --> 35:12.020]  and you're doing presentations.
[35:12.260 --> 35:14.400]  And I hated every second of it.
[35:14.720 --> 35:18.220]  But luckily, I got good enough at it that we were able to get most of our stuff made.
[35:18.240 --> 35:23.440]  But the idea that we don't have to do that now, that one sheet doesn't have to get generated
[35:23.440 --> 35:24.780]  for us to make something.
[35:25.380 --> 35:31.120]  You have like that is so much of my behind the scenes rooster teeth life that nobody,
[35:31.120 --> 35:35.400]  even most of y'all, maybe Eric some at never saw, you know,
[35:35.500 --> 35:37.760]  was just the fucking work I had to get in.
[35:37.900 --> 35:41.920]  I had to put into cajoling people to give us enough money to do something or to say yes,
[35:42.320 --> 35:46.380]  or even get the fucking cast to buy in because nobody wanted to do anything at some point.
[35:46.480 --> 35:48.760]  You know, it was like constant.
[35:48.900 --> 35:51.660]  I felt like a salesman 24 hours a day at Rooster Teeth.
[35:51.720 --> 35:53.360]  I think we talked about this before.
[35:53.620 --> 35:55.280]  Maybe it was like during a lunch or something.
[35:55.620 --> 35:58.440]  I had no idea that that's how you guys operated.
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.420]  Like I never, you know, it's not like I was watching a ton of Achievement Hunter or anything,
[36:02.680 --> 36:05.400]  but I didn't know that people were like saying no to ideas.
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.420]  And this was, I don't know, like a year into us doing like let's play and stuff.
[36:10.460 --> 36:13.920]  And they're like, yeah, it was so hard to pitch this to this person or this person
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.720]  didn't want to do that.
[36:14.740 --> 36:16.780]  And it's like, what, the video games?
[36:17.340 --> 36:19.800]  People said no to the video games.
[36:20.100 --> 36:22.820]  And it's like, I just don't, I don't have that.
[36:22.920 --> 36:24.160]  I have games that I want to play.
[36:24.320 --> 36:27.560]  But when you guys go, let's play web fishing, it's not like I'm gonna go,
[36:27.560 --> 36:30.220]  no, I don't want to play web fishing.
[36:30.520 --> 36:31.160]  Like what?
[36:31.920 --> 36:35.200]  Sometimes it was because of money and stuff, but a lot of times it wasn't.
[36:35.280 --> 36:40.200]  But like Hardcore Monopoly was a show we did that everybody loved.
[36:40.300 --> 36:41.220]  We did it for two seasons.
[36:41.320 --> 36:42.900]  The company couldn't get enough of it.
[36:42.940 --> 36:44.380]  The audience couldn't get enough of it.
[36:44.440 --> 36:46.600]  It was a huge driver for first and all that stuff.
[36:46.940 --> 36:54.600]  But before that, I spent four fucking years pitching that show over and over and over
[36:54.600 --> 36:55.840]  again and getting told no.
[36:55.840 --> 36:59.040]  And then trying again in a couple months or, hey, we got a new tranche of money.
[36:59.120 --> 36:59.800]  Let's try again.
[36:59.860 --> 37:04.960]  Or, you know, our corporate goals have restructured.
[37:05.060 --> 37:05.920]  So maybe it fits in.
[37:06.000 --> 37:07.800]  It just, it took me four years to get that made.
[37:07.820 --> 37:09.580]  And then you get it made and they're like, cool, we want more of it.
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.980]  What? Hardcore everything.
[37:11.080 --> 37:12.700]  And you're like, God, you fucking assholes.
[37:12.880 --> 37:17.460]  I just love that that's, I don't have to live in that world.
[37:17.720 --> 37:18.540]  I mean, do you remember that?
[37:19.020 --> 37:21.600]  That's when we, I think we did our first sausage talk.
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.180]  That was the thing I said about taking over Let's Play, of us being mindful or worrying
[37:27.180 --> 37:30.220]  about like, we're going to do this and all they're going to ask for is this thing.
[37:30.540 --> 37:32.360]  And it's going to take focus away from the podcast.
[37:32.740 --> 37:36.320]  And like a note that I'm seeing from people online is like, yeah, I just really like the
[37:36.320 --> 37:36.700]  podcast.
[37:36.800 --> 37:39.400]  I wish they wouldn't talk so much about the Let's Plays or I wish, you know, it wasn't
[37:39.400 --> 37:40.380]  such a focus or whatever.
[37:40.520 --> 37:43.620]  And it's like, yeah, that's the thing I was afraid of.
[37:43.860 --> 37:46.960]  And we're more controlled for it and everything.
[37:47.140 --> 37:47.800]  And I don't know.
[37:47.920 --> 37:49.760]  It's just still something to be mindful of, I suppose.
[37:50.080 --> 37:50.500]  Totally agree.
[37:50.600 --> 37:51.100]  Totally agree.
[37:51.100 --> 37:56.240]  That's sort of where I think having that like Friday or whatever supplemental slot, just
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.020]  having something regular for that, I think would be nice because it's hard, you know,
[38:00.020 --> 38:02.660]  like we've had so much fun with video game stuff.
[38:02.840 --> 38:09.680]  But if you looked at the history of our show, it is incredibly new in the terms of like
[38:09.680 --> 38:12.240]  we went a long time without touching anything video game related.
[38:12.420 --> 38:14.180]  And it's been such a fun thing to explore.
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.260]  And obviously there's that history with Achievement Hunter, but I just it's it's wanting to like
[38:19.260 --> 38:22.620]  be mindful of we really started being audio centric.
[38:22.860 --> 38:25.620]  And let's not forget to develop that.
[38:25.700 --> 38:29.980]  Yeah, I think our main podcast is the main focus and always will be.
[38:30.480 --> 38:34.540]  And even though we play video games for work, we kind of always did that.
[38:34.700 --> 38:38.080]  Like Andrew and I used to play all the time outside of work before we were recording them.
[38:38.280 --> 38:43.200]  So it's not like we're like using up resources that we would be putting into the podcast.
[38:43.300 --> 38:48.960]  But I do think we can be better about not going over moments from Let's Plays we just filmed
[38:48.960 --> 38:50.960]  in the middle of a regulation.
[38:51.160 --> 38:53.620]  It's just so much of what we do is enthusiasm based.
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.040]  But I think I think it's good to keep it in check.
[38:56.300 --> 39:00.440]  And, you know, I'll be honest, I love doing the video game stuff and it's reignited my
[39:00.440 --> 39:01.240]  love of video games.
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.760]  And I I'd be scared to see how many hours of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 I have right now
[39:06.760 --> 39:08.000]  going for these Dark Matter skins.
[39:08.320 --> 39:10.420]  I just hit my fifth prestige yesterday.
[39:11.180 --> 39:13.100]  Hey, I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting there.
[39:13.280 --> 39:17.940]  But I've never had as much fun playing a video game with you guys as I have doing a draft
[39:17.940 --> 39:18.640]  with you guys.
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.380]  Just so the audience knows, like, I love the video game stuff.
[39:22.480 --> 39:23.400]  It's low-hanging fruit.
[39:23.500 --> 39:24.000]  It's easy to do.
[39:24.060 --> 39:24.420]  It's great.
[39:24.660 --> 39:30.800]  But when we're cranking and arguing about hot dog and ice cream pairings, that to me
[39:30.800 --> 39:32.400]  is like Shangri-La.
[39:32.600 --> 39:35.000]  That's my Garden of Eden, personally.
[39:35.260 --> 39:38.480]  It's a lot funnier to see dogs and cream draft on the calendar, too.
[39:39.620 --> 39:40.440]  Yeah, it is.
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.740]  That said, like, you know, that's pure creative expression.
[39:45.020 --> 39:48.100]  And it doesn't get any better than that, I think, personally.
[39:48.100 --> 39:52.080]  And we should say that Andrew obviously handling all of the video game post.
[39:52.300 --> 39:55.020]  But pretty much it's just Nick doing the audio post.
[39:55.160 --> 39:55.580]  Oh, yeah.
[39:55.740 --> 39:56.880]  You just take care of it.
[39:57.060 --> 39:58.080]  It's pretty simple.
[39:58.180 --> 40:01.940]  The upside to that is I don't have to worry about the post on the other side of stuff.
[40:02.020 --> 40:04.000]  The only thing I'm really doing is just helping gathering.
[40:04.680 --> 40:08.380]  We use a backup system that's an add on to Discord.
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.660]  It's called Craig, and he automatically records.
[40:10.900 --> 40:15.320]  It's not the best quality, but it's still better quality than, say, not having audio at all.
[40:15.780 --> 40:21.240]  So, you know, so after a recording is over, I'll go back and pull those and add them to
[40:21.240 --> 40:23.420]  the folder where we've uploaded everything.
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.240]  And that's that's kind of like the extent of where I touch all the any and all of the
[40:27.240 --> 40:27.860]  gaming stuff.
[40:27.960 --> 40:31.700]  But all the audio stuff is just simple because it's the podcast and it's the drafts and it's
[40:31.700 --> 40:32.320]  all the other things.
[40:32.420 --> 40:34.360]  And it's, you know, weekly.
[40:34.420 --> 40:36.020]  So it's easy to track in that sense.
[40:36.060 --> 40:37.880]  And I still have the Craig backups if I need them.
[40:38.260 --> 40:41.560]  We rarely need to use them, but they're there just in case.
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.520]  And it's, you know, there are weeks where it's obviously busier than others.
[40:45.660 --> 40:46.840]  You know, someone's out of town.
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.560]  We have a holiday or something coming up or whatever.
[40:49.720 --> 40:51.620]  And we've recorded multiple like back to back.
[40:51.940 --> 40:53.640]  Suddenly it becomes like, oh, where the hell is this thing?
[40:53.940 --> 40:57.900]  But it's been really simple and easy to keep track of everything now that I don't edit
[40:57.900 --> 40:59.280]  a hundred podcasts.
[41:00.600 --> 41:05.960]  Yeah, but I was going to say, like, I run two companies with you and you are the busiest,
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.400]  I think, in both.
[41:07.400 --> 41:11.840]  Like, you're just constantly on something, doing something, on to the next edit.
[41:11.940 --> 41:12.620]  Here's more stuff.
[41:12.700 --> 41:13.400]  Here's another proof.
[41:13.480 --> 41:14.780]  Hey, can we get this up on this day?
[41:14.920 --> 41:18.880]  Like, I think you're... and you have a very young kid.
[41:19.280 --> 41:22.500]  You are insanely busy.
[41:22.700 --> 41:23.980]  You're insanely busy.
[41:24.100 --> 41:24.620]  It's crazy.
[41:25.100 --> 41:28.880]  Well, it's funny because it's like the balance of the back and forth is like, I don't want
[41:28.880 --> 41:31.980]  either company to feel like they're not being prioritized.
[41:32.080 --> 41:35.780]  So I prioritize both like certain days of the week, like focusing on an edit.
[41:35.780 --> 41:38.740]  And if we have a recording or something come up, I can push that edit back.
[41:38.960 --> 41:40.740]  And it's just kind of finding that balance.
[41:40.860 --> 41:48.040]  And obviously, the young kiddo is also a bit of a... like last week, Eric was like, we
[41:48.040 --> 41:49.820]  were going to record something at a set time.
[41:49.880 --> 41:50.560]  We're like, we're all ready.
[41:50.660 --> 41:51.160]  Let's do this.
[41:51.220 --> 41:53.040]  And I was like, nah, I dropped off my kid.
[41:53.140 --> 41:55.740]  I had to go to the car shop.
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.840]  Oh, the kid has a doctor's appointment.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.440]  Oh, the kid has another doctor's appointment.
[42:00.540 --> 42:03.180]  You know, it's just... so it's like finding that balance.
[42:03.180 --> 42:05.140]  Geoff probably knows better than most.
[42:06.140 --> 42:07.820]  It's been funny jokes on our end, though.
[42:08.020 --> 42:09.300]  We've all appreciated it.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.180]  Yeah, in the moment, they're not as funny to me.
[42:11.240 --> 42:12.320]  But afterwards, I love them.
[42:17.920 --> 42:20.200]  Are you... now, do you feel good about that, Nick?
[42:20.280 --> 42:21.880]  Like, do you feel like you're in a good place?
[42:21.940 --> 42:24.920]  Is there anything we could do to lessen the load to make your life easier?
[42:25.320 --> 42:26.360]  Because I think it's good.
[42:26.420 --> 42:29.440]  It's a good time for a check-in because you are balancing these two companies.
[42:29.440 --> 42:33.720]  And like, for instance, if you need us to, Gavin and I will go over there tonight and
[42:33.720 --> 42:35.140]  burn 100% eat to the ground.
[42:35.300 --> 42:37.200]  Like, we're happy to do that.
[42:37.480 --> 42:38.440]  Why did we show you the office?
[42:39.060 --> 42:42.360]  No, I think I'm in a pretty good spot.
[42:42.480 --> 42:45.140]  I think the only times where we could potentially run into things,
[42:45.300 --> 42:46.660]  but we know ahead of time usually,
[42:47.080 --> 42:50.940]  is just when we have a supplemental that is one of the audio ones,
[42:51.080 --> 42:56.400]  in addition to like, say, a busy recording week for us or a busy recording week for 100% eat.
[42:56.400 --> 42:59.380]  So it's probably just up to me to be like,
[42:59.620 --> 43:01.340]  Hey, do you mind if we reach out to someone else?
[43:01.380 --> 43:05.480]  And we have actually had a couple of folks that we reached out to to help us with a couple edits.
[43:06.120 --> 43:11.240]  Dennis, who actually edited Face in several instances, probably in between
[43:11.960 --> 43:16.560]  when I was unavailable and when Kelly was unavailable to edit the original run of the show.
[43:16.600 --> 43:17.860]  And he would step in and do that.
[43:17.880 --> 43:19.180]  So he's been able to help us with a few things.
[43:19.200 --> 43:21.240]  He actually put together all the advent calendar stuff
[43:21.240 --> 43:23.100]  since that had a video component as well.
[43:23.360 --> 43:24.760]  So he's been very helpful.
[43:24.760 --> 43:28.160]  It is weird, actually, that you mentioned that because I was listening to an audio.
[43:28.700 --> 43:30.740]  I think it was an actual regulation episode.
[43:30.920 --> 43:31.560]  It was.
[43:31.660 --> 43:34.440]  And I was like, someone else edited this, didn't they?
[43:34.460 --> 43:36.760]  I could just tell from listening.
[43:37.060 --> 43:37.680]  It was snappier.
[43:37.860 --> 43:39.640]  It was a little bit snappier. There was less pauses.
[43:39.960 --> 43:42.920]  Did you like it better? Do we like Dennis better than Nick?
[43:43.180 --> 43:44.780]  Hey, Nick, plug your ears for a second. Earmuffs.
[43:44.800 --> 43:45.260]  Okay, hold on.
[43:47.040 --> 43:49.680]  I feel like Nick edits us the best.
[43:50.060 --> 43:51.720]  I do too. He is us.
[43:51.940 --> 43:52.320]  He's us.
[43:52.320 --> 43:52.800]  Aww.
[43:56.760 --> 43:57.480]  Thank you.
[43:59.300 --> 44:02.540]  I feel like we kind of like have discussed kind of scheduling stuff.
[44:02.580 --> 44:06.360]  Is there anything related to like the schedule that we want to touch on that we haven't?
[44:06.780 --> 44:10.760]  Well, there's going to be a period at some point where I think we talk about new ideas,
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.500]  and some of the new ideas are going to would be related to altering the schedule.
[44:14.600 --> 44:18.400]  So I don't know if that's a natural segue or we want to just hold off on that.
[44:18.580 --> 44:20.260]  I'd love to hear about new ideas.
[44:20.260 --> 44:22.820]  Why don't we do real quick just run through merch?
[44:22.940 --> 44:24.620]  And I don't think it needs to be a long conversation,
[44:24.820 --> 44:26.940]  but just kind of catch people up to where we are.
[44:26.980 --> 44:29.880]  Because merch is the thing that Face did very well.
[44:30.100 --> 44:33.280]  And that regulation has it has in its infancy right now.
[44:33.300 --> 44:37.740]  And we're definitely like merch is one of the reasons I feel like I'm not jogging yet.
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.040]  But we're getting close.
[44:39.400 --> 44:41.120]  You know, we did the big run.
[44:41.360 --> 44:44.940]  What we did in 2024 was we created the structure.
[44:45.120 --> 44:49.240]  We found a partner that looked good that we that we wanted to give a shot to that.
[44:49.240 --> 44:52.300]  Maybe we could trust that worked with some people that used to work at Rooster Teeth
[44:52.300 --> 44:53.880]  that we had a lot of respect for.
[44:54.540 --> 45:00.640]  And we did essentially two tests through that company to make sure that the website works.
[45:00.740 --> 45:02.420]  The company is able to handle the volume.
[45:02.540 --> 45:08.460]  As a matter of fact, that company did a fucking no shade to our previous fulfillment house at
[45:08.460 --> 45:08.760]  Rooster Teeth.
[45:08.900 --> 45:14.060]  But the new company handled those Gerplers better than any Gerpler drop we've ever had.
[45:14.740 --> 45:15.720]  At Rooster Teeth.
[45:16.060 --> 45:16.380]  I agree.
[45:16.600 --> 45:18.820]  They were so quick and efficient and on it.
[45:18.820 --> 45:21.600]  And their response to us was, that was great.
[45:21.740 --> 45:24.140]  We want more, which I fucking love to hear.
[45:24.200 --> 45:24.460]  Right.
[45:24.960 --> 45:31.020]  And so I think we all feel now in 2025 really good about the partnership we have with our
[45:31.020 --> 45:33.960]  fulfillment company and the pipeline that we have developed.
[45:34.180 --> 45:38.840]  And now we want to turn the nozzle on the hose a little bit more.
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.180]  Obviously, we have more Gerplers coming in February and Kooslers as well.
[45:43.240 --> 45:44.260]  We've talked about that.
[45:44.260 --> 45:48.920]  But we also have some t-shirt related merchandise coming up in the few months.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.600]  We've been, we were in the lab.
[45:51.080 --> 45:53.340]  I don't, have we talked about this on episode?
[45:54.460 --> 45:55.180]  Not really.
[45:55.340 --> 45:58.640]  It's something that we kind of like poked around, but I don't think we like talked about it,
[45:58.680 --> 46:00.480]  talked about it because we didn't know if it could be like made.
[46:00.840 --> 46:01.160]  Yeah.
[46:01.400 --> 46:02.400]  But it can be made.
[46:02.680 --> 46:05.640]  So we should probably talk about it on the main podcast then.
[46:05.940 --> 46:11.260]  But we have an innovative t-shirt idea that we're going to launch hopefully in the next
[46:11.260 --> 46:11.680]  few months.
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.360]  And that I think is going to revolutionize casual dress.
[46:15.520 --> 46:18.620]  You're going to be able to get a lot more mileage out of your clothing than you used
[46:18.620 --> 46:18.920]  to.
[46:19.520 --> 46:21.220]  And we're pretty excited about that.
[46:21.520 --> 46:27.820]  But that's kind of where we are is now that we feel really good and we feel like we have
[46:27.820 --> 46:28.720]  a solid foundation.
[46:28.820 --> 46:35.000]  We want to start making more merch and doing it more in the way that we did with F***face,
[46:35.080 --> 46:40.580]  which is where the merch is very often a piece of the bit or a part of the bit or the reason
[46:40.580 --> 46:42.460]  for the bit or the byproduct of the bit.
[46:42.520 --> 46:45.300]  But it's somehow of the content and it's not just a logo slap.
[46:45.620 --> 46:49.940]  And that was a scary thing for us because we didn't know that we'd be able to get that
[46:49.940 --> 46:51.720]  kind of service again outside of RT.
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.260]  That's a tremendous boutique service we received in the company.
[46:55.600 --> 46:59.360]  I think a thing that like we released the Gerplers and there were 4,000 and it sold
[46:59.360 --> 47:00.420]  out so fast and everything.
[47:00.500 --> 47:01.680]  And people like, why don't you just do more?
[47:01.720 --> 47:04.380]  And it's like, we've never done anything like this as just five guys.
[47:04.940 --> 47:07.940]  We didn't like, we don't know what we're doing.
[47:08.020 --> 47:10.020]  We don't know if this is going...
[47:10.020 --> 47:12.660]  We could have gotten 4,000 and the whole thing could have tanked.
[47:12.740 --> 47:17.780]  And we couldn't have, and we could have sold none because of a issue with Shopify.
[47:18.240 --> 47:19.900]  Like there could have been so many things that went wrong.
[47:20.040 --> 47:22.400]  We had to test in like a bunch of different ways.
[47:22.460 --> 47:23.540]  That's why we put the shirt out.
[47:23.980 --> 47:28.720]  Like we're baby stepping into this thing, not because it's, I think with like content,
[47:28.720 --> 47:30.300]  we can be a little bit more experimental.
[47:30.740 --> 47:33.940]  I don't want to be experimental with your money.
[47:34.360 --> 47:36.020]  This is why we don't do pre-orders.
[47:36.180 --> 47:38.380]  It's why we do merch like the way that we're doing it.
[47:38.420 --> 47:39.400]  We're slow rolling it.
[47:39.400 --> 47:43.920]  We're figuring it out now is because when you, when it's your money parting from you,
[47:44.020 --> 47:45.920]  I don't want that to be an issue.
[47:46.020 --> 47:50.240]  I want you to be thrilled with the thing that you got and the thing that you bought
[47:50.240 --> 47:51.460]  and there were no problems.
[47:51.480 --> 47:52.540]  And it was super smooth.
[47:52.980 --> 47:55.420]  That's what I'm hoping for every time we're putting stuff out.
[47:55.460 --> 47:59.540]  And now I feel really confident working with this company and what we're doing.
[47:59.540 --> 48:02.920]  And I am so excited for like mid-February with these new Gerplers.
[48:03.100 --> 48:04.980]  Can you imagine like my nightmare?
[48:05.100 --> 48:08.260]  We always talked about like, you know, with the ordering and stuff and how many to order.
[48:08.260 --> 48:12.480]  But my real nightmare was what if we sell 4,000 Gerplers in 10 minutes
[48:12.480 --> 48:14.220]  and the company can't ship them?
[48:14.460 --> 48:17.480]  Because they're overloaded and it breaks their system.
[48:17.900 --> 48:20.000]  And they're having to hire seasonal help to come in.
[48:20.280 --> 48:24.260]  And now instead of having 4,000 people disappointed because they didn't get a Gerpler,
[48:24.440 --> 48:28.180]  we have 4,000 people disappointed because they paid money for a Gerpler that they didn't get,
[48:28.240 --> 48:30.140]  which is way worse to me, you know?
[48:30.540 --> 48:30.640]  Yep.
[48:30.880 --> 48:33.760]  So, you know, appreciate everyone being patient with us.
[48:33.820 --> 48:35.760]  I feel like, especially for this drop or whatever,
[48:35.900 --> 48:37.580]  there were people that were disappointed they didn't get it.
[48:37.580 --> 48:38.620]  And I totally understand.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.420]  You know, I want the things that I want when I want them as well.
[48:41.520 --> 48:44.360]  But I really appreciate people being patient and understanding
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.020]  that we are just five guys trying a new thing with a company that is a new company
[48:48.020 --> 48:49.940]  that we hadn't worked with before, ever.
[48:50.120 --> 48:52.320]  Like we worked with Natalie and we worked with Tony.
[48:52.560 --> 48:55.080]  And well, I don't know any of these other people.
[48:55.240 --> 48:56.100]  And it was really positive.
[48:56.280 --> 48:58.900]  It was a super positive thing that went really well.
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.660]  And I think now we're really excited to like ramp up.
[49:01.780 --> 49:04.840]  I think this year is going to be the year of like really cool merch for us.
[49:05.100 --> 49:06.300]  Yeah, I think so too.
[49:06.300 --> 49:08.040]  But that's that's merch in a nutshell.
[49:08.160 --> 49:11.460]  I feel like we've talked ad nauseum about it in previous Sausage Talks,
[49:11.500 --> 49:12.940]  but we're in a really good place.
[49:13.060 --> 49:17.520]  We build a good foundation and we're excited to start taking more swings.
[49:17.900 --> 49:20.760]  We'll announce the Gerplers soon in like an actual episode also,
[49:20.840 --> 49:22.580]  but it'll be mid-February, so don't don't worry about it.
[49:22.660 --> 49:26.620]  In addition, I think with, you know, moving forward and looking forward for new stuff,
[49:26.680 --> 49:30.580]  I think we're also very open to the idea of looking at the back catalog
[49:30.580 --> 49:34.580]  for merch that people really identified with or like that they weren't able to get more of.
[49:34.580 --> 49:38.040]  Like we could sell more scrumping signs or
[49:39.320 --> 49:41.860]  protected by falcon signs if that was a thing that people wanted, you know,
[49:42.140 --> 49:46.200]  like that because that stuff is in the vault doesn't mean the vault stays shut or has to stay shut.
[49:46.360 --> 49:50.460]  Important to note that we have the rights to all those things and we can make them as we see fit.
[49:50.520 --> 49:51.940]  We can look in both directions with merch.
[49:52.200 --> 49:53.620]  We talked about it the other day.
[49:53.800 --> 49:55.900]  It was the slop o'clock clocks or whatever,
[49:56.060 --> 49:58.080]  and we just went that thing was so good and it didn't sell.
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.180]  That's the thing I'm worried about.
[49:59.440 --> 50:01.760]  It was just us being bummed to death about that slop o'clock.
[50:01.760 --> 50:05.000]  God, I love it, too, because we all talked about how we have it hanging in our houses.
[50:06.280 --> 50:07.560]  I'm looking at it right now.
[50:07.600 --> 50:10.880]  Me, too. It's right behind me. It's great. I love that thing. It's great. Fantastic.
[50:11.360 --> 50:15.360]  OK, Andrew, do you have some falcon questions or is there anything else you guys want to get at?
[50:15.540 --> 50:18.580]  I sure do. Yeah. Is there anything else we want to touch on before?
[50:18.700 --> 50:20.020]  I feel like we wrap on questions.
[50:20.540 --> 50:23.260]  I think we go to questions and we kind of just see where it goes,
[50:23.260 --> 50:25.400]  because I have a feeling there's going to be more that we're going to want to talk about.
[50:25.460 --> 50:26.980]  And this is really going to spark us in a direction.
[50:27.400 --> 50:30.080]  I do. I do think we don't do it now. We can do it after questions.
[50:30.080 --> 50:34.340]  But I do think, Eric, we should pitch Wheel of Decades at some point in this.
[50:34.420 --> 50:36.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, guys, stay tuned through questions,
[50:36.360 --> 50:39.580]  because at the end of questions, we're pitching Wheel of Decades.
[50:40.560 --> 50:41.800]  And are we Nostradamus?
[50:42.080 --> 50:45.860]  I am so excited to learn what both those are. I pulled some questions.
[50:46.320 --> 50:49.240]  We honestly we should make time to do a sausage talk that are just questions.
[50:49.520 --> 50:53.080]  We have so many of them that are good. These are just some that I pulled.
[50:53.220 --> 50:56.920]  If your question is not asked here, don't worry. I like I have it saved.
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.160]  It's just these are ones that I pulled for this specific recording.
[51:00.480 --> 51:02.400]  First one comes from Mr. Fedora Mustache.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.560]  Would the guys ever retry old content slash bets,
[51:05.920 --> 51:10.660]  slash alphabet, 100% chocolate, a successful bean hole, bobbing for Bovril?
[51:11.140 --> 51:15.200]  I was curious if you guys had any bets that you felt like didn't deliver in the past
[51:15.200 --> 51:16.860]  or that you'd have any interest in revisiting.
[51:17.060 --> 51:18.480]  I thought that was an interesting question.
[51:18.560 --> 51:19.880]  Nothing came to mind for me personally.
[51:20.260 --> 51:21.520]  I want Eric to drink the Bovril.
[51:22.420 --> 51:24.520]  Do we talk? Did we talk about that in Mexico?
[51:24.800 --> 51:26.040]  Like, oh, have you ever had that?
[51:26.040 --> 51:27.880]  No. And you're like, you should try it.
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.660]  No, Nick wants it.
[51:30.120 --> 51:31.180]  Nick wants to try it.
[51:31.340 --> 51:32.600]  See, that's the thing. Nick wants it.
[51:33.100 --> 51:34.720]  Okay, that's what we should do.
[51:34.800 --> 51:36.140]  Me and Nick will try it together.
[51:36.360 --> 51:37.800]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[51:38.160 --> 51:42.600]  Yeah, it used to be that the food stuff was typically done by Geoff, Andrew and myself.
[51:42.760 --> 51:43.060]  Yes.
[51:43.240 --> 51:45.780]  Before you two other guys became a bigger part.
[51:46.180 --> 51:50.640]  And maybe, yeah, maybe there's like a little backlog gauntlet of disgusting food that you
[51:50.640 --> 51:51.140]  should go through.
[51:51.140 --> 51:57.280]  I will say, as a person who's had a Bovril two ways, stateside and overseas, the best
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.000]  way to experience Bovril for the first time would probably be in England itself.
[52:02.140 --> 52:06.040]  Maybe we should make a trip over to England just for you guys to drink Bovril.
[52:06.380 --> 52:06.940]  Watch some Philly.
[52:07.340 --> 52:07.940]  Yeah, we could do that too.
[52:08.180 --> 52:09.000]  Ooh, okay.
[52:11.100 --> 52:13.360]  You just increased the price of this bit.
[52:13.780 --> 52:14.440]  Yeah, no kidding.
[52:14.580 --> 52:17.400]  I thought it was going to be $1 and it's way more than $1 now.
[52:17.520 --> 52:18.440]  $1,000 one.
[52:18.440 --> 52:23.640]  I think the stuff that we need to pay off is the face off stuff.
[52:23.740 --> 52:25.780]  Yeah, I think I think we need to do.
[52:25.960 --> 52:26.620]  We'll figure it out.
[52:26.820 --> 52:28.140]  We don't have to get into it here or whatever.
[52:28.600 --> 52:30.440]  We need to do the Deputy Indiana thing.
[52:30.560 --> 52:31.540]  We have to figure out.
[52:31.840 --> 52:35.540]  Billboard is a pretty loose term, I think, at this point because we don't have the buying
[52:35.540 --> 52:36.720]  power of Warner Brothers.
[52:36.880 --> 52:40.500]  But I think Nick needs to wear these boots and we'll figure that out at a later date
[52:40.500 --> 52:40.660]  too.
[52:40.760 --> 52:45.440]  And we have to physically visit Deputy Indiana and at least put a stick with a sign on it
[52:45.440 --> 52:46.440]  in the ground or something.
[52:46.440 --> 52:52.180]  Do you think there's a guy in Indiana or Deputy Indiana called Bill and it could just be Bill's
[52:52.180 --> 52:53.720]  board and he just holds it sometimes?
[52:54.300 --> 52:56.060]  He holds it sometimes.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.460]  This is Bill's board that he occasionally holds.
[52:59.660 --> 53:00.100]  You know what?
[53:00.220 --> 53:01.360]  I had the exact same thought.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.580]  I completely agree with you, Gavin.
[53:04.860 --> 53:05.160]  How many?
[53:05.220 --> 53:05.900]  What was the population?
[53:06.860 --> 53:08.260]  Less than 10,000.
[53:08.520 --> 53:09.180]  It was like 800.
[53:09.640 --> 53:11.460]  Yeah, very, very, very, very, very low.
[53:11.740 --> 53:13.820]  There's got to be a Bill and 800 people.
[53:13.940 --> 53:14.740]  There's got to be a Bill.
[53:15.000 --> 53:15.980]  One in 800 name.
[53:15.980 --> 53:16.720]  In Indiana?
[53:16.940 --> 53:17.180]  Yeah.
[53:17.600 --> 53:18.460]  Yeah, I guarantee you.
[53:18.680 --> 53:19.740]  There's probably 10 Bills.
[53:20.100 --> 53:22.460]  Well, it does say Deputy Indiana population 19.
[53:22.880 --> 53:23.360]  Whoa.
[53:23.500 --> 53:25.040]  I thought it was like 800 when we looked it up last time.
[53:25.360 --> 53:25.560]  Oh, yeah.
[53:25.900 --> 53:26.520]  Oh, no.
[53:26.660 --> 53:28.640]  Maybe they had a bad run of COVID or something.
[53:28.860 --> 53:32.320]  The census in 2010 was 86.
[53:32.760 --> 53:35.300]  In 2022, population of 19.
[53:36.440 --> 53:38.560]  That might be a stretch for a Bill.
[53:39.180 --> 53:40.020]  It's possible though.
[53:40.260 --> 53:40.780]  It might be.
[53:41.360 --> 53:43.300]  Maybe we'll just stick it on Bill's grave.
[53:44.000 --> 53:45.140]  Oh, my God.
[53:45.140 --> 53:45.960]  Jesus.
[53:46.420 --> 53:48.620]  I thought we got past the grave thing with you.
[53:48.700 --> 53:49.500]  He's dead.
[53:49.600 --> 53:50.680]  He doesn't care.
[53:51.020 --> 53:52.020]  He's in heaven.
[53:52.540 --> 53:52.940]  Well, maybe.
[53:53.120 --> 53:53.480]  Or hell.
[53:54.020 --> 53:54.240]  Yeah.
[53:54.380 --> 53:54.940]  To be determined.
[53:55.120 --> 53:56.140]  If he's in hell, fuck him.
[53:56.660 --> 53:58.700]  Next question comes from Josh Thomas.
[53:59.280 --> 54:02.140]  What have been some of the crew's favorite moments since the rebrand?
[54:02.720 --> 54:06.540]  Any like specific thing jump out to you guys is like, man, this is great.
[54:06.980 --> 54:12.100]  I think the streams for me have been something where it's like doing a make way thing and
[54:12.100 --> 54:15.260]  it being five or five or being yelled at for an hour in Pico Park.
[54:16.040 --> 54:17.240]  And then there's one bit.
[54:17.660 --> 54:23.860]  There's one bit of Pico Park where I was just I was behind Eric and he had to jump over a thing
[54:23.860 --> 54:28.220]  and I just kept ramming into the back of him and he and he just goes, give me space.
[54:28.480 --> 54:34.160]  Give me space, give me space, give me space, I back off and he runs straight into the enemy.
[54:37.700 --> 54:39.020]  No, I don't remember that.
[54:39.020 --> 54:44.740]  Uh, I really enjoyed sloppy Joe's bingo sloppy bingo on Halloween.
[54:44.940 --> 54:45.920]  Oh, that was so much fun.
[54:46.040 --> 54:46.600]  That was a great one.
[54:46.860 --> 54:47.020]  Yeah.
[54:47.160 --> 54:50.980]  Also, the night we watched Eric's wrestling show together with the audience.
[54:51.060 --> 54:52.880]  That was so great.
[54:53.020 --> 54:54.380]  I appreciated that so much.
[54:54.400 --> 54:55.440]  That meant so much to me.
[54:55.500 --> 54:56.320]  Thank you very much.
[54:56.380 --> 54:58.140]  That really was great.
[54:58.300 --> 54:59.100]  We had a blast doing it.
[54:59.360 --> 55:02.180]  I think it's not even like a moment that sticks out to me.
[55:02.240 --> 55:06.440]  It's the regular schedule that we have that I look forward to.
[55:06.440 --> 55:11.580]  Like, before we recorded this today, I was sitting in the discord for half an hour,
[55:11.960 --> 55:13.420]  just going like, I'll see if anyone's early.
[55:13.620 --> 55:20.160]  Like, I just, I love, I love just being able to make the time to do this stuff where we didn't
[55:20.160 --> 55:21.980]  have the time for it previously.
[55:22.580 --> 55:24.480]  Now it's like a lot of gameplays, a lot of other stuff.
[55:24.600 --> 55:25.780]  And it's just, it's fun.
[55:25.920 --> 55:27.420]  It's like a lot of fun to do.
[55:27.540 --> 55:28.700]  And I love doing it.
[55:28.940 --> 55:31.720]  I never don't look forward to getting together to do this stuff.
[55:31.920 --> 55:32.920]  Yeah, that's such a great call.
[55:32.920 --> 55:39.400]  I had a very similar experience where I guess last week I was super sick and I was going to
[55:39.400 --> 55:41.040]  miss our Monday sync, but I was awake.
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.140]  I was like, I'll just, I can't talk, but I'll just listen so I can keep in the loop on like
[55:45.140 --> 55:46.300]  what this week looks like.
[55:46.560 --> 55:49.020]  And that was the highlight of my week that week.
[55:49.140 --> 55:53.620]  And I spent the rest of the week going like, just having that like 30 minutes to hang out
[55:53.620 --> 55:54.080]  with you guys.
[55:54.100 --> 55:55.060]  It was just so much fun.
[55:55.460 --> 55:59.440]  How lucky I am that I get to have that be part of my work.
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.740]  That like the highlight of my week to that point from just like happiness and like entertainment
[56:03.740 --> 56:05.980]  was a Monday sync meeting.
[56:06.360 --> 56:07.180]  It's crazy.
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.520]  That's an incredibly privileged position to be in that I'm incredibly thankful for.
[56:11.780 --> 56:12.360]  I feel the same way.
[56:12.420 --> 56:17.000]  I really like cherish all the time that we get to just chat and record and do work.
[56:17.040 --> 56:21.900]  And even in the time in between, I'm really excited to make stuff and then just show it
[56:21.900 --> 56:24.620]  to you guys like we did with the GTA highlights.
[56:25.140 --> 56:27.880]  And I would have made that little GERPLER promo.
[56:27.880 --> 56:30.880]  I was just so excited to show you after I was done making it.
[56:31.000 --> 56:31.880]  Oh, it's so cool.
[56:32.260 --> 56:37.360]  I think the moment I realize when we've gone and this is a poor example, but it's the only
[56:37.360 --> 56:39.420]  one that's in my head at the moment because I just saw it again.
[56:39.420 --> 56:44.380]  But realizing when we've gone from like Falcon to Falcon, where you just like you're in a
[56:44.380 --> 56:47.940]  moment and something is interesting or like a hot dog is a great example.
[56:48.380 --> 56:50.180]  A hot dog was a throwaway question.
[56:50.480 --> 56:51.560]  It wasn't actually it wasn't a question.
[56:51.740 --> 56:55.020]  A hot dog was my answer to a question I was asking you guys.
[56:55.540 --> 56:59.580]  And you go from like to realize when you've gone from like that moment where it's just
[56:59.580 --> 57:03.400]  like the dumbest little thing or you're like, is that a fucking Falcon that just walked
[57:03.400 --> 57:03.860]  by the pool?
[57:04.100 --> 57:07.480]  And then the next thing you know, you're sold out of merch, you know?
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.260]  Or there's a hot dog count on the website and everybody's you know, Reddit's awash with
[57:13.260 --> 57:14.340]  people tracking their hot dogs.
[57:14.460 --> 57:16.760]  And you're like, man, it's so weird when you have that.
[57:17.020 --> 57:20.620]  There's like a moment when you realize, oh, that little thing became this big thing because
[57:20.620 --> 57:23.480]  you've been along for the ride the whole time, so it feels quite natural to you.
[57:23.480 --> 57:27.560]  But when you at some point, you naturally take a step back and then you see it for like,
[57:27.860 --> 57:30.120]  how did that dumb thing turn into this big thing?
[57:30.260 --> 57:32.220]  That's a really cool feeling.
[57:32.220 --> 57:33.340]  And I felt that a lot this year.
[57:33.500 --> 57:38.440]  It's weird to see like quite a heated or quite a serious discussion over such a dumb thing
[57:38.440 --> 57:39.160]  sometimes as well.
[57:39.820 --> 57:41.700]  Like, what counts as a hot dog?
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.700]  Yeah, I love it so much.
[57:45.020 --> 57:46.240]  And I get it in person a lot.
[57:46.420 --> 57:48.860]  That's a question people like to ask me when they run into me.
[57:49.100 --> 57:53.140]  And I gotta be like, well, there's a spirit to it.
[57:53.960 --> 57:59.480]  We were talking the other day about how exciting it is to run into regulation listeners in real
[57:59.480 --> 57:59.780]  life.
[58:00.000 --> 58:03.200]  It's that so many of them are right up to date on the podcast.
[58:03.560 --> 58:05.480]  They'll talk to you about something that came out yesterday.
[58:05.880 --> 58:08.580]  And because it's still fresh in my mind, I'm like, yeah, can you believe it?
[58:08.640 --> 58:10.060]  Like, what a bunch of bullshit.
[58:13.000 --> 58:16.880]  It is awesome because you feel like you have something like you can talk about now, right?
[58:16.900 --> 58:18.240]  Like, it's really cool.
[58:18.520 --> 58:22.480]  It really is cool when somebody comes up to me and says, oh, Geoff, it's so nice to see
[58:22.480 --> 58:22.680]  you.
[58:22.680 --> 58:26.140]  I loved Red vs Blue, and I watched it every day in middle school.
[58:26.440 --> 58:27.300]  You meant a lot to me.
[58:27.360 --> 58:28.160]  And you go, thanks, man.
[58:28.180 --> 58:28.980]  I really appreciate that.
[58:28.980 --> 58:29.760]  And then you move on with your day.
[58:29.880 --> 58:31.000]  But then somebody comes up to you, though.
[58:31.140 --> 58:32.820]  I really like what you did yesterday.
[58:32.820 --> 58:34.700]  You're like fucking awesome.
[58:34.900 --> 58:35.440]  Yeah, it's great.
[58:36.760 --> 58:39.540]  Next question is from Paul Davenport.
[58:39.960 --> 58:43.140]  Any update on the Eric and or Nick plays Halo 2?
[58:44.100 --> 58:46.560]  Yasso, Hasso, Nasso, Lasso.
[58:47.340 --> 58:51.540]  That's the thing we talked about that I'm very excited as a possibility.
[58:51.540 --> 58:53.160]  Doesn't even have to be Halo 2.
[58:53.500 --> 58:57.440]  Just Eric's first experiences with some of these games being in a lasso format.
[58:57.580 --> 58:58.420]  I think it's so funny.
[58:58.660 --> 58:59.820]  Don't make it Halo 2.
[58:59.920 --> 59:00.600]  That's cruel.
[59:00.860 --> 59:03.080]  It couldn't be Halo 2 because it's two player.
[59:03.240 --> 59:03.720]  Is it?
[59:03.880 --> 59:07.000]  It's a two player, but it's also the hardest, most unforgiving.
[59:07.180 --> 59:08.840]  Yeah, I think that's mine and Nick's series.
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.360]  Yeah, yeah, that that could finally be Gavin and Nick's show.
[59:14.540 --> 59:15.280]  I'd watch it.
[59:15.560 --> 59:16.920]  I hope we still get along at the end.
[59:17.480 --> 59:18.080]  It's hell.
[59:18.540 --> 59:20.840]  What's a what's a lasso that we do then?
[59:20.840 --> 59:22.100]  Like, I don't know anything about this.
[59:22.240 --> 59:23.540]  Reach was a good lasso, right?
[59:23.760 --> 59:24.600]  Three to Reach?
[59:25.000 --> 59:25.780]  Reach works.
[59:26.240 --> 59:27.120]  Three would be doable, probably.
[59:27.440 --> 59:28.260]  Three and Reach are great.
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.040]  There's also like the endurance based stuff in ODST that we could do.
[59:32.140 --> 59:33.760]  Like we could try to get that two hour achievement.
[59:34.300 --> 59:34.660]  Remember that one?
[59:34.700 --> 59:35.460]  Yeah, let's do that.
[59:36.160 --> 59:36.840]  The Fid Master.
[59:37.360 --> 59:38.420]  Fid Master Challenge.
[59:38.640 --> 59:39.420]  There's a few of those, right?
[59:39.740 --> 59:40.060]  Yes.
[59:41.320 --> 59:43.300]  Next question comes from Christopher Shanks.
[59:43.820 --> 59:47.220]  Have you guys thought of doing a cassette release of an episode since you've done the vinyl?
[59:47.940 --> 59:50.460]  Because that's more popping up now.
[59:50.840 --> 59:51.820]  In like a weird way.
[59:52.440 --> 59:57.520]  Also, I don't know a lot about cassettes, but theoretically, couldn't we make that ourselves?
[59:57.940 --> 59:59.420]  As opposed to pressing a vinyl?
[59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.840]  You wanna like record a cassette in real time, one at a time?
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.480]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:05.120]  Like, couldn't we theoretically do that?
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.280]  Like there's no...
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.840]  We can't press a vinyl, but we could technically make a shitty cassette.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.260]  Yeah, we could.
[01:00:12.060 --> 01:00:15.780]  It would take like nine years to make 10,000 of them, probably.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:16.580]  Who's we?
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:17.540]  Who is we?
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.420]  Oh yeah, who is we?
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.060]  Well, Nick's the audio guy.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:21.140]  That's true.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.840]  Uh, I mean, I feel like we'd be doing it just to do it, right?
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.260]  I do not feel a pull to do cassette anything.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:35.540]  And then also in terms of like what merch capabilities I guess we have and what we could do.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.560]  I just, I don't know.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.000]  I don't know.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.200]  Are cassettes gonna bang?
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.860]  I don't really... we'd have to do like so limited.
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:48.540]  Andrew and Nick, I did pitch Gavin and Eric on an idea for a vinyl over the weekend that
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:51.880]  I don't think they're on board for, but maybe you guys are excited about it.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.900]  Absolutely not on board for it.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:53.780]  No, absolutely not.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.240]  We were talking about what different things to do with the wheel.
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:59.140]  One of the funny ideas we came up with is a pocket wheel of decisions.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:02.040]  You spin it and then it like whatever it lands on, it's like, it's kind of like the
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.760]  magic eight ball, but you just carry it around your pocket.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:07.240]  And whenever you want to make a decision, you spin the wheel and then it tells you like
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.980]  half a car or no, or do it tomorrow.
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.820]  But what if we recorded...
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.560]  Similarly, what if people wanted to glean insights from the wheel?
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:24.900]  What if we created a vinyl that was the wheel and then every song on the vinyl is like an
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.300]  eight second song, eight second track.
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:34.380]  And it's just 55 minutes of going, yes, 11, do it Wednesday.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.440]  And then you just, wherever you turn the record on, wherever you drop the wheel and whatever
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.680]  you hear, that's your answer to your question.
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:43.500]  I like it.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:44.460]  I like it a lot.
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.440]  Uh, yeah, we got to do this.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.560]  All we got to do is convince Nick.
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:48.340]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:48.660]  Why not?
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.600]  You have to be two sided, though, because one of the things that have to be flipped to the
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.160]  other side.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.600]  Yeah, go to flip.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.060]  Yeah, go to other wheel.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.260]  Yeah, go to other wheel.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.340]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:03.580]  Now, I thought you were about to pitch the choose your own adventure vinyls, which that's
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:04.840]  I'm not on board for that.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.640]  This is fine.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:08.340]  I'm fine with one vinyl where you needle drop.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.920]  I feel like the choose your own adventure pitch kind of morphed into this by the end.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.520]  You guys steered me away from the choose your own adventure thing, and you were right.
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.680]  I think this is a better version.
[01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:17.480]  Yeah, I'm fine.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.940]  I'm fine with this idea.
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:26.060]  If we want one vinyl of for an hour, we just record things that we just record responses.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.800]  To be fair, these are not Andrew's 20,000 things.
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.120]  These are responses to a wheel.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.340]  These would be wheel items.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.000]  Next question comes from William McLaughlin.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:40.220]  How difficult is it to manage production slash release cycles given the spontaneous nature
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.460]  of the group, i.e. a person has a good idea in an episode or other video?
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.580]  What's the scheduling like for getting that content created and released before everyone
[01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:49.140]  forgets?
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.860]  I think that's the thing we're working on.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:56.460]  It took us three months to fucking record this episode of Sausage Talk.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.400]  Yeah, it's a work in progress.
[01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.580]  Started pushing it in early November.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.100]  It shifts if there's a thing that you really want to push off the ground.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.740]  Like for me, the advent calendar was something I really wanted us to do.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:10.140]  And so all of my focus was on that.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.040]  So the premise of like trying to get anything else was just not viable.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.460]  And it'll be interesting to see with you guys if there are things like that with the
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.780]  advent calendar for you, where you kind of use like a bigger thing, just trying to push
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.760]  it to get made.
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.160]  I feel like every once in a while, there's an idea that's just so good.
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.760]  Everybody is equally invested and on board.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.560]  And then it just gets pushed to the top and just gets made as quickly as possible.
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.200]  Next question comes from Taylor Bolton.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.840]  Would love to know whether you find it easier to market regulation with the name change.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:43.080]  Like more search hits, viewers, etc.
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:47.500]  Now that you're not stuck behind the SEO minefield that was F***face.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.300]  I feel like just not having asterisks is a huge improvement when it comes to search.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.740]  Just being able to say the show name is nice.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.740]  Just casually.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.440]  I've had a lot of people come up to me, not maybe a lot, but I've had a few people come
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.920]  up to me in person and thank me for changing it or thank us for changing it to a name that
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.140]  they can tell their family about.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:07.160]  I've appreciated it.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.200]  It's been nice.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:10.440]  What do you think, Eric?
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.700]  We don't really do any marketing.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.220]  We definitely don't.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:18.320]  So in terms of what the marketing is, there's not much of a difference, but it's easier
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:18.980]  to sell ads.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.100]  It's easier to get to work with other companies.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.560]  They're more apt to look at our numbers and then they see the name and they don't think
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.280]  twice about it.
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.200]  Where before you look at the numbers, you see the name and you go, we can't advertise
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:32.720]  on that.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960]  And so it's a move on from there.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:40.160]  Um, but I, yeah, I think it's a way better, I think Regulation Podcast is a way better
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.860]  name than F***face ever was.
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.580]  I also like that we, we verbicized it.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.440]  So it's, it still lives on when we F***face ourselves.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.940]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:51.120]  I think there's still nuggets of that stuff.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.760]  I just think, uh, we were at a company that never named anything well.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:59.440]  So, uh, the first thing we did was pick a good name for something and then, you know,
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.600]  shot into the stratosphere.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.560]  So I feel good about it.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:04.720]  Tying into sort of the next question from Stockholm Child Kicker.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.860]  Were there any other potential names going around during the rebrand?
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.920]  Was calling it Andrew ever on the table again?
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.480]  I don't think it was ever really on the table to begin with.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.900]  And I don't, I don't think we had any other.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.260]  Well, you came up, you came up with this podcast name.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:17.800]  I did.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:19.440]  Years before we used it.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:20.460]  You pitched it to us.
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.240]  And in that moment, we all fell in love with it.
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.020]  So we always knew that was going to eventually be the name of the podcast.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:26.720]  Yeah.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:31.120]  I mean, it's, it's nice that that is such a clean experience, but it would have been
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.740]  just if there were like sessions of us trying to pitch name, that would have been so chaotic.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:39.600]  I would have loved to have known what would have come out of that.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:42.640]  I wish we had a more compelling answer than like,
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.320]  we had an alternative that we just went with that and we were all happy with it.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.060]  But that is what happened.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.660]  Next question by Nina Hart.
[01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:53.580]  What has been your biggest reward and challenge running your own company versus operating under
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.440]  a parent company?
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.140]  I don't know how to like quantify challenge like it's endless challenge.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.160]  It is, yeah.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.220]  Paying ourselves.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:01.860]  Yeah.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:09.120]  I think the most rewarding thing has been seeing the community grow and how much support we have
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.840]  in a one-to-one basis where you don't, I don't think we saw that previously.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.520]  I think that's the most rewarding thing to me is seeing the people come out of the woodworks
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:20.400]  and kind of support us and stick with us as we kind of keep going.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:23.740]  That's been really fantastic because, you know, you just sort of put it out there and
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.400]  you have no idea.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.500]  I mean, speaking for this and for 100% Eat, people go like, I love that podcast.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:30.640]  And you go, right, but how much?
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.660]  Because we're about to find out.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.400]  And I think we've seen a lot.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:36.740]  I think it's more than seeing it, right?
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.100]  It's the feeling it, right?
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:38.400]  Yeah.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:38.880]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.300]  Yeah, you definitely feel it.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.920]  The challenge is there's no safety net.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:47.300]  I mean, we've talked about that a lot, but the challenge is like, if we don't do it,
[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.120]  it doesn't get done.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:50.320]  And if you burn out, that's too bad.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:57.100]  Like that is, we're running it like a sprint and it's really hard to do that.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.100]  You have to be really mindful.
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:03.540]  I didn't take any time off, really, until this trip to Mexico since we launched.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.740]  And that's eight or nine months of running.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.160]  Yep.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.600]  You're running a marathon and a sprint.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:14.860]  And it's like, I have to be way more mindful of that for myself, of having to...
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.740]  I want to put everything that I have into this, but if I give everything that I have,
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.600]  then I don't have anything left to give later.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:25.700]  And that's been a really hard thing where I can't...
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.420]  There's nothing to...
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.280]  Sometimes there's just like nothing to delegate to somebody when there's a bigger idea or when
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.660]  there's something we need to do.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:38.920]  It's hard to get it done sometimes or when you have...
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.600]  When it's the fifth most important thing on your list, but other people, it's number one or number
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:42.780]  two.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.020]  Sure.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.660]  I think that's the hardest thing.
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.580]  That's very well said.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.500]  I just also remembered another thing that I loved since we started this company from the
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.100]  previous question.
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:58.900]  I loved how such a dull recording as the kicker-re-picker turned into something so off the
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:01.460]  rails and how we were all just all in on it.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.220]  Like, think about that.
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:08.840]  After we've sold a thousand vinyls of The Wheel, look back and you'll be like, Andrew
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:16.100]  threw out a rule change in part two of a video that turned into a record that people buy
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.020]  potentially down the road.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.420]  Assume we go that route, you know?
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:19.860]  Like, that's fucking crazy.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:21.360]  It was just a rule change.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:27.600]  It goes into the joy of, like, people being willing to just do stuff where on the surface
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.600]  it makes sense to do like a mid-season revisit and just sort of like recap.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.000]  And then it became a thing of like, well, we need to solve this problem of some of us
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.080]  don't have kickers at this point.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.060]  What's the mechanism behind it?
[01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:41.840]  And I went into that going like, I don't really know.
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.940]  Like, I was messaging Eric being like, what, like, what makes sense?
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.500]  Like, how will this even work?
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.600]  And then I told you that we shouldn't do the thing that you wanted to do.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.440]  And you went, yeah, and then did it.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.300]  I don't remember that conversation going that way.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:00.080]  But the point being that that was a thing that I even went into going like, I don't
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:00.980]  really know how this is going to work.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.900]  We're just going to figure it out.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:03.100]  We're going to throw things out there.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.880]  We'll see what happens.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.280]  And it turned chaotic in an unbelievably fun way.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:12.820]  I do think genuinely the most challenging thing, at least on my end, is the fact that
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:19.080]  we started a company with three Americans, a Brit and a Canadian, and it's very hard
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.020]  to pay ourselves.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.760]  And it's very hard to get health care.
[01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:29.120]  And all of this fucking annoying behind-the-scenes grown-up shit is just constantly, it's like
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:31.460]  always in a state of almost done.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.420]  And when you get past a step, there's another thing you have to do, or there's another
[01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:40.260]  series of forms that you have to fill out by the end of the year, or there's another...
[01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:46.980]  We have, I feel like we're, we must be embezzling money 80s style through the Cayman Islands.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.060]  We have so many fucking companies we've had to create just so that we can all be in a
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:50.620]  business together.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.180]  It's like, it's all very above the board and legal.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.480]  We're not.
[01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:58.200]  But it's just like, it is so complicated to run the behind-the-scenes of running something
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:05.880]  as simple as five sub-intelligent people talking for an hour and five minutes about movies
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:06.560]  and food.
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:06.920]  Yeah.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:07.280]  You know?
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.300]  Absolutely.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.900]  Eric posted a screenshot.
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.500]  Do you think a mechanic should exist in the Geeky Picker Re-Picker that allows someone
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.900]  to steal a player from someone else?
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:18.100]  I feel like if we do it again, we should add a wrinkle like that.
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:18.860]  Right.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.060]  That was you very politely saying no.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:22.060]  Correct.
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.480]  Yeah, I didn't interpret it that way at the time.
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:26.560]  Great.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:27.820]  That was...
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:29.840]  So you were saying for the next pick-up.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.460]  Not for the re-picker.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:31.740]  Uh-huh.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:32.240]  Yes.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.340]  Do we know who won that, by the way?
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.220]  I need to go in and check because I think there's an issue with the site.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:43.580]  We have a member in our community that has updated with the movie league and the kicker
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.820]  stuff, and they do such an amazing job.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.520]  I need to confirm because that was such a chaotic recording.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:53.320]  I think I have seven kickers on the site, and I don't know if that's on purpose where
[01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320]  everyone else is six.
[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:57.340]  Like, I just I've been meaning to revisit that and then lock in.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:57.620]  Okay.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.400]  I mean, if we want to have a look at it right now, me and Andrew are tied.
[01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:02.720]  There's no way.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.940]  $7.49 and $7.49.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.580]  Yeah, but Andrew has an extra character.
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.360]  Yeah, I think I've got an extra kicker.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:09.780]  Yeah.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.820]  So, you know, just saying.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:15.440]  And do we know that Eric's count is even correct?
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.560]  We should probably go look into that.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:17.960]  What count?
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.020]  My count of what?
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:21.000]  This isn't my count.
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:22.240]  I didn't make this website.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.100]  Mine was wrong for one week.
[01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:26.260]  And the guy was like, oh, I had the aggregate thing was wrong.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:27.620]  And he had to change it and fix it.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.080]  Why did you say Eric's count?
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.100]  What did Eric do?
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:30.760]  Because yours could be wrong.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:36.060]  You were saying like, I was the one who was counting the points.
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:37.000]  No, no.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.600]  For your kicks.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.160]  We don't know that your kicks are correct is all I'm saying.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:45.400]  Well, to be fair, Eric did botch a lot of the movie draft with his
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.480]  not assigning and not taking away points.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.980]  And the total pot was wrong.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.880]  I don't remember that, but we'll get to the bottom.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.080]  I would have won the movie draft or something.
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:54.620]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.360]  I'm pretty sure it would have come in first, man.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.680]  But that's another thing I like about how we're always on board to just take
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.360]  the video in whatever direction it goes.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.840]  And then we basically just hand it off to the audience
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.240]  and members of the community build these websites.
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:08.980]  Oh, that's so cool.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:12.200]  I even saw someone made a made a slider that they can
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.580]  slide from one to ten about how the episode is going.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.940]  And then it like graphs it all out.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.240]  That's amazing.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.040]  I'll say just like one other quick thing about a joy of,
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.120]  you know, just being us as a small company.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.580]  There's a meeting.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.680]  I just put this together relatively recently as, you know, now thinking about the past.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:36.700]  I took a meeting and it made no sense
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.600]  for like why we had to have this meeting and the information that came from it.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.440]  Like it just it had no value.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.660]  But at the time, you know, like you're just moving and it's like whatever that happened.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.080]  And then realizing now that that had to take place for somebody to
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.960]  show a boss that they did X thing.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:57.100]  Like the fact that there's all this procedure and time wasted around
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:02.720]  just having to establish that work was done as opposed to what could have just been
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.420]  like a two minute.
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.060]  We're doing this, right?
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.680]  Yes, just not having to deal with that.
[01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:10.780]  No time waste.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.900]  And that way is so nice.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.240]  So rewarding.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:14.680]  Yeah.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.280]  No, this could have been an emails in our company.
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.060]  Yes.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:21.640]  The last question for Misa Soup 247.
[01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.980]  Does Andrew still have his get out of Greg free card?
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.540]  Boy, do I.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.420]  And man, am I thinking about using it on the podcast that we recorded yesterday.
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.920]  I was laying in bed last night going, do I use it?
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.580]  Because I have a feeling that I might need to.
[01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.260]  So how does it work?
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:47.480]  You would apply it next episode and say it was for the previous episode.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.840]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:53.380]  I will have already taken all of the abuse by the time it applies.
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.680]  I don't know if it counts.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.520]  What if you play it on our socials right before the episode comes out?
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.640]  Maybe we'll see.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.140]  Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:02.940]  I'm considering.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:07.020]  What if we what if we just you just record a little intro that's right before the podcast
[01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.600]  that Nick can, you know, stick on the front of it.
[01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.200]  It's just like you saying, hey, this is Andrew.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.920]  I just want to let you guys know before you listen to this.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.720]  Not that there's a reason to.
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.840]  But just, you know, I just felt like using my get out of Greg free card this week.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.140]  Enjoy.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.900]  All right, I'm going to put a little bit more thought into it.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.340]  But I do feel it should work like money in the bank and wrestling,
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.120]  where you can just run and deposit it whenever you want to, essentially.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.040]  Like, that's how in my head I need to get out of Greg free card.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.020]  When did you actually get it?
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:40.540]  What was it for?
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:44.980]  I don't remember, but it's been years and I've been so scared to ever use it
[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.500]  because I don't trust myself ultimately.
[01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:49.040]  Is it just you that has to get out of Greg free card?
[01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.980]  Yeah, I don't remember how I got it, but I think I'm the only one that has.
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:53.720]  Interesting.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.140]  It was something I did.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:56.100]  I think there was something.
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:56.880]  Oh, you know what?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.980]  I remember now it was for getting the tuxedo.
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.460]  I was the only one that went to that.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.420]  I took care of it and I was below the budget.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.560]  And yeah, that's how I earned it.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:07.920]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.540]  That's a good call.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.040]  I will see if it gets played.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.840]  People listening to this will know there's no lead in to the next episode.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.360]  And those are my questions.
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:18.680]  I don't know if you guys have anything else you want to wrap up on.
[01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.140]  I feel like we've covered quite a bit, but
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.300]  I don't have everyone's itinerary in front of me, so I don't know.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.200]  Anything else you guys want to expand on in the sausage talk?
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:31.580]  Uh, I think we wanted to pitch those two ideas to you, if you don't mind.
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:32.220]  Please.
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.920]  I want to say we came up with like five new ideas in Mexico,
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.420]  one of which definitely can't be discussed right now.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.300]  Okay.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:43.680]  Then the one I pitched yesterday in podcast, which was the birth year movie draft.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:50.580]  In addition to that, we came up with an idea for a predictions draft called
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.260]  Are We Nostradamus?
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:58.820]  Where we do, we go through and we do it snake draft style as we do.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.220]  Each person gets to pick a prediction of something they think is going to happen
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.240]  in the world in 2025.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.260]  Then in January of 2026, we reconvene and do a video where we say,
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:13.920]  Were We Nostradamus?
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.040]  And then we find out how many of our predictions come true.
[01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.380]  And it could be anything, you know, like,
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:24.080]  I think Gavin or Nick said John Mulaney dies.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:24.920]  Oh, my God.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.140]  But it could also be like, I said, a cruise ship crashes.
[01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.420]  Like it could be, but it could be a good thing to love this.
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.100]  Maybe somebody undies and then everybody's happy.
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.760]  But yeah, we just come up with our predictions or a few extras because we may overlap.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.500]  And then we put it out in the universe and we see how prescient we are.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.680]  I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:43.940]  Yeah, I can't wait to film that.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.640]  If anyone gets any right, I mean, they'd be insane.
[01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.840]  Oh, it's crazy, isn't it?
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.960]  Imagine that we do pick John Mulaney dies and then John Mulaney dies.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.200]  Like, that's crazy.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:54.740]  That would be crazy.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.940]  If we get anything right, we get to release a shirt that said, yep, we're Nostradamus.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.040]  And who's the shirt?
[01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:07.700]  It's for us.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:08.460]  We'll buy it.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.000]  We'll buy it.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.580]  Oh, OK.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.660]  I think Geoff just really wants a shirt that says, yep, I'm Nostradamus.
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:18.520]  What if the winner, if you get something right, you get a Greg card?
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.940]  Oh, I like that.
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:21.960]  That's interesting.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:22.840]  That's a good idea.
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:27.340]  Maybe there could be a whole structure kind of like, did you guys ever watch the Bozo the Clown
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:28.520]  show when you were a kid?
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.180]  Yes.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.000]  Well, Eric's going to know this then.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:35.320]  I actually did a things to do in Saints Row the third based off of it.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:39.760]  But they would put a bunch of buckets out in a row, one to five.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.560]  And there was a prize in each bucket.
[01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:43.440]  And then a kid would get a ping pong ball.
[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.020]  And if he could throw it in the first one, then he got a shot at the second.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.800]  And then if he got to the third, he had a shot at the third.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:53.300]  So maybe there's like, if you get one prediction correct, you get a get out of Greg free card.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.200]  And if you get two, there's like an even better gift or reward.
[01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.600]  And three and four and five and like five would be insane.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:01.200]  Or four, I think, would be max.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.020]  Maybe if you get two, you get the Greg card.
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.780]  But if you get one, you just get like a shot in the dark of a Greg.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.920]  You have an opportunity to roll a sheer shot in the dark.
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.560]  There's a 20, 25% chance.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:26.460]  I am so on board with all of us having a shot in the Greg dark card for any.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.800]  Oh, and it has to be used like Survivor where you get one and you have to pull it.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:33.340]  And there's a one in seven.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.100]  And if you're right, then you just you've won the argument.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:38.540]  Yeah, and everyone has to back down.
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.920]  Yeah, everyone has to just put their weapons down.
[01:18:41.260 --> 01:18:43.120]  Even the whole community has to be like, yeah, he was right.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.800]  Everybody has. Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:46.980]  That's so funny.
[01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:52.730]  Oh, that would be so infuriating for somebody.
[01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:53.590]  I'm just.
[01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.210]  To use it efficiently.
[01:18:56.930 --> 01:18:58.330]  Oh, that would be so frustrating.
[01:18:58.410 --> 01:18:58.770]  Potentially.
[01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:01.450]  It's like those fucking state farm commercials.
[01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:03.990]  I think their state farm or the couple is arguing.
[01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:06.710]  And then one of them pulls out a challenge flag and throws it down.
[01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:10.010]  And then something they bring out of the video unit and they get to watch the conversation
[01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:11.990]  that just happened to see if the husband said the thing or not.
[01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:13.930]  Oh, that's fucking great.
[01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:20.230]  What I'm really excited about with Are We Dostodonis is we're at that time of year where
[01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:26.510]  very specific podcasts do their predictions going into the next year and recap what they made before.
[01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:30.050]  Like I listened to a boxing podcast and I just listened to an episode of this.
[01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:32.410]  That is such a specific field.
[01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:35.350]  And I would say 80% of their predictions were wrong.
[01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:40.750]  So the premise of it just being any topic, any any thing is going to be so insane.
[01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:44.370]  That's what was so funny to me when Geoff was pitching it because I was thinking like,
[01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:47.930]  oh, you know, there could be like a war or like a natural disaster or like maybe a
[01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:51.250]  volcano goes off. And then he was like, what if a cruise ship crashed?
[01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.890]  Anything.
[01:19:55.210 --> 01:19:57.170]  I like it.
[01:19:57.210 --> 01:20:01.570]  I was I was looking at cruise ships on the horizon at night from our from our
[01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:04.310]  balcony, you could see the like just the lit up cruise ships in the distance.
[01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:06.970]  And I was thinking, man, this thing's got to crash sometime, right?
[01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:11.930]  Hard to turn one of those around on a dime, you know?
[01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:14.730]  Oh, for sure. And what was the other idea?
[01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:19.090]  Oh, the other idea is Eric will probably have to jump in to help.
[01:20:19.290 --> 01:20:24.290]  But we we it's a couple of ideas that kind of morphed into one.
[01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:26.790]  We're going to call this the Wheel of Decades.
[01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:28.670]  And we create a wheel.
[01:20:28.670 --> 01:20:36.850]  And on the wheel, the options are 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s.
[01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:38.690]  And then we spin the wheel.
[01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:42.970]  And whatever decade we land on, let's say we land on the 80s.
[01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.370]  We all then do our own research.
[01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:51.850]  We look, we Google, and we find all of the TV shows from the 80s that sound
[01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:53.690]  interesting that we've never seen.
[01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:55.570]  It's important that you've never seen it.
[01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:59.050]  And then we compile a list and we look at the group together.
[01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:02.470]  And then we find the show that none of us have ever seen,
[01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:03.750]  like the Six Million Dollar Man.
[01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:04.790]  Nobody ever watched it.
[01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:10.530]  Or maybe I think the idea Eric used was Renegade, right?
[01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:11.650]  The Lois Llamas show.
[01:21:12.130 --> 01:21:15.170]  Or Pacific Blue, which is a show I'd never heard of that he showed me.
[01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:18.450]  It's like cops on fucking scooters or something.
[01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:19.370]  It's like Baywatch on bikes.
[01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:20.770]  Yeah, it's like Baywatch on bikes.
[01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.950]  And then we identify and then we pick the show, right?
[01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:27.470]  And then we become the biggest fans in the world of that show.
[01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:30.410]  And we all get together and we watch it together.
[01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:32.870]  We watch an entire season together.
[01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:36.290]  And then we record a watch-along style content of it.
[01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.890]  And then we release it once a week or whatever for the audience.
[01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:42.510]  And then they can go watch it along with us, essentially.
[01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:48.050]  And it's just like us consuming an entire run of a show that none of us have ever seen before.
[01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:50.870]  And we get to experience it all together for the first time.
[01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.410]  I love it.
[01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:53.390]  And we do just great watch-along content.
[01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:54.630]  I think that's so much fun.
[01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:58.890]  The thing that I really like is us spinning the wheel.
[01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:05.470]  And then at the same time, everyone independently looking up shows from that decade.
[01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:07.650]  But we are all still recording together.
[01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:10.690]  So then we're just putting them onto a sheet or whatever.
[01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:14.170]  And then we're kind of whittling down as we go.
[01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:15.210]  Like, oh yeah, this or that.
[01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:17.690]  We should listen to this or we should watch that or whatever it is.
[01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.490]  It's great.
[01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:20.470]  I think that would be great Patreon stuff.
[01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:23.730]  Putting that on Patreon, these watch-alongs or whatever.
[01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.930]  So everyone can watch with us if they want to.
[01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:26.670]  I think it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:28.490]  And then it has a beginning and an end.
[01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:29.930]  You know, it's a self-contained thing.
[01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:34.330]  It makes sense for it to end because it's an eight-episode season or a 19-episode season
[01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:34.690]  or whatever.
[01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:38.050]  So it's an additive thing that we throw up.
[01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:43.270]  But because it begins with an end in sight, I don't think people would be upset when it's over.
[01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:45.590]  You know, it was just an extra thing that we got.
[01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:47.310]  And then we can always do another one down the road.
[01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:49.410]  Or if we like it enough, we can go on to season two.
[01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:51.690]  Or we can spin the wheel again, you know.
[01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:54.490]  And it just becomes a way for us to hang out in the evening
[01:22:54.490 --> 01:22:57.070]  and watch something together in a fun way.
[01:22:57.190 --> 01:22:58.950]  And make the kind of content that we love to make.
[01:22:59.590 --> 01:23:02.750]  Because we all love to do the watch-along stuff or the commentary stuff on movies.
[01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:06.250]  And also in a structured way that is something we can give to the audience.
[01:23:06.650 --> 01:23:07.230]  Completely agree.
[01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:08.450]  Yeah, I think that's so much fun.
[01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:09.370]  I'd love to do that.
[01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.970]  Gavin, what do you think of the Wheel of Decades?
[01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:11.810]  Love it. I'm in.
[01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:13.250]  Sounds like we're going to do it.
[01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:14.030]  I said, yeah, hell yeah!
[01:23:16.230 --> 01:23:19.630]  All right, I think those were the only things we wanted to pitch.
[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:21.210]  I'm excited.
[01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:22.750]  What a fun sausage talk.
[01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:24.890]  That's how some of the sausage was made.
[01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:26.770]  That is... look at that.
[01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:29.150]  I'm good, thanks.
[01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:31.390]  You can nom nom it, I guess.
[01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:36.210]  Nick, you want to take us out on the nom nom?
[01:23:36.770 --> 01:23:40.190]  Do you think if a sausage was long enough, could I...
[01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:43.070]  If Eric chugged ketchup, right?
[01:23:43.630 --> 01:23:49.610]  And then I took a really long dog, put it all the way down to the stomach,
[01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:52.150]  could I dip it in ketchup and pull it back out?
[01:23:52.530 --> 01:23:53.010]  In Eric?
[01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:53.630]  Yeah.
[01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:54.170]  Yeah.
[01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:58.630]  Why was that important to specify, Nick, that it was in me?
[01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:00.530]  Well, you're shorter than us.
[01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.790]  It's the shortest distance to travel.
[01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:08.510]  Yeah!
[01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:13.430]  What if I was mostly back like Andrew, though?
[01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:18.450]  What if one person was ketchup and the other was mustard?
[01:24:19.650 --> 01:24:21.570]  And then you're eating this?
[01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:25.150]  You got mad when I showed the cake that was kind of wet.
[01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:28.030]  Yeah, why did you turn into Gigi Allen all of a sudden?
[01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:31.530]  Good question.
[01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:35.630]  Well, thanks for listening to Sausage Talk.
[01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:38.110]  This is... I think this has been insightful.
[01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.010]  This was a good one.
[01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:43.170]  I thought that there was a lot here, a lot going on, a lot to discuss.
[01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:46.290]  If we missed anything, become a falcon and ask a question
[01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.110]  and then we can cover it on the next one, I guess.
[01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:53.050]  Guys, anything that we want to leave everyone with as we kind of like wrap this up?
[01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:56.270]  Thank you so much for supporting us and allowing us to continue to do this.
[01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:57.210]  Thank you!
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:58.890]  I like your Q&A idea as well.
[01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:59.930]  I think that should be the next one.
[01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:00.750]  The what?
[01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:03.350]  Andrew was saying do it like a dedicated Q&A.
[01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:05.170]  Oh, yeah, for sure.
[01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:06.210]  That's a great idea.
[01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:07.890]  Answering the questions is a lot of fun.
[01:25:07.890 --> 01:25:11.250]  The questions are always super interesting and they think to ask
[01:25:11.250 --> 01:25:14.250]  things we don't think to talk about naturally, which I appreciate.
[01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:15.070]  That's awesome.
[01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:16.090]  So we should definitely do that.
[01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:16.890]  Sounds like a plan.
[01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:19.350]  But until then, thank you so much for listening.
[01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:20.550]  Have a great rest of your day.
[01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.170]  Bye!
