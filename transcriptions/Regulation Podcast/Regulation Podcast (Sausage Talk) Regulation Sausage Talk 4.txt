[00:00.000 --> 00:03.860]  Hello and welcome to another Regulation Supplemental.
[00:03.900 --> 00:07.720]  This is Sausage Talk number four, I believe.
[00:08.200 --> 00:08.460]  Yeah, it is.
[00:08.600 --> 00:11.900]  My name is Geoff Ramsey, with me as always, the other four.
[00:13.100 --> 00:17.780]  Speaking of four sausages, Eric, Gavin, Andrew and Nick,
[00:18.400 --> 00:19.920]  we decided to have a sausage talk.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.240]  I think, Gavin, you actually called sausage on this one.
[00:23.400 --> 00:24.620]  I think it was a good sausage call.
[00:25.020 --> 00:27.700]  I agree. He threw the sausage flag down.
[00:28.260 --> 00:30.840]  Oh, maybe we need a sausage flag to go with the potato flag.
[00:30.880 --> 00:32.940]  Oh, just a sausage.
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.560]  You can bung a discord and it just ends the conversation.
[00:37.660 --> 00:38.800]  Save it for the sausage.
[00:39.180 --> 00:41.700]  I have a sausage related question in a general sense.
[00:42.020 --> 00:45.060]  OK. How many sausages are in a pack of sausages?
[00:45.520 --> 00:48.020]  Typically. Twelve. Twelve.
[00:48.860 --> 00:51.440]  No, eight. Yeah, I would think eight.
[00:51.740 --> 00:52.220]  I would think eight.
[00:52.660 --> 00:56.340]  Yeah, I think once we once we hit our ninth sausage talk, that's season two.
[00:56.340 --> 00:58.240]  I think we bundle the first eight.
[00:58.500 --> 01:00.000]  That's a pack. That's season one.
[01:00.200 --> 01:02.340]  I have seasonal sausages.
[01:02.840 --> 01:03.520]  I think so.
[01:04.820 --> 01:06.680]  I think I like a nice pack of sausages.
[01:06.760 --> 01:08.740]  We can't have too many sausages in the pack.
[01:08.880 --> 01:11.560]  It would get all crammed and get squished.
[01:12.200 --> 01:15.940]  What if there was a store that was called Baker's Dozen
[01:15.940 --> 01:18.080]  and it just sold stuff in thirteens?
[01:19.320 --> 01:20.680]  That was it's shtick.
[01:21.360 --> 01:21.860]  Interesting.
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.240]  Is there because people always complain that hot dog buns and hot dogs
[01:28.240 --> 01:31.420]  don't sell in equal amounts, like you get more buns than dogs.
[01:31.620 --> 01:33.840]  Is there other foods like that?
[01:33.920 --> 01:36.180]  And if so, that could be a great gimmick for a store,
[01:36.300 --> 01:39.860]  a store that only sells equal items of everything you need.
[01:40.540 --> 01:41.940]  Oh, hmm.
[01:42.260 --> 01:45.720]  But I can't think of another example, really, of the hot dog, hot dog bun.
[01:46.100 --> 01:49.460]  Yeah, I was going to say, I think most things that I get are in the equal
[01:49.460 --> 01:50.700]  amount of things that I need.
[01:50.700 --> 01:51.420]  Like, typically.
[01:51.880 --> 01:55.520]  I think, unfortunately, the hot dog, hot dog bun might be the only example.
[01:57.420 --> 01:59.800]  Is that well, I guess maybe burger to burger bun.
[02:00.240 --> 02:01.660]  That probably doesn't line up.
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.260]  You don't hear about that nearly as much.
[02:03.820 --> 02:07.400]  I think more people make patties than buy patties.
[02:07.480 --> 02:08.780]  Probably. Yeah, I agree.
[02:09.440 --> 02:09.880]  Yeah, I guess.
[02:09.940 --> 02:12.960]  And then you could theoretically do other things with that meat
[02:12.960 --> 02:14.880]  in a way that you can't with a hot dog.
[02:15.160 --> 02:16.920]  You can do a lot with that meat if you want to.
[02:17.200 --> 02:18.460]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:19.120 --> 02:21.120]  Yeah. What you've been doing with your meat, Geoff?
[02:21.740 --> 02:23.540]  Oh, dude, I've been doing a lot with my meat.
[02:23.640 --> 02:24.360]  Thank you for asking.
[02:24.500 --> 02:25.920]  You know, I bought that. I just want a meat check.
[02:26.100 --> 02:27.100]  We've been doing ankle checks.
[02:27.180 --> 02:28.700]  I think it's time we start doing meat checks.
[02:28.960 --> 02:31.020]  I love it. I love that we're doing meat checks.
[02:31.100 --> 02:35.200]  I bought that Ninja wood fired electric grill, you know?
[02:35.380 --> 02:36.780]  So I've been doing the.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.020]  Oh, you've been doing the grill.
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.520]  I did some lemon pepper chicken the other night.
[02:40.600 --> 02:41.120]  It was all right.
[02:41.440 --> 02:43.100]  It was thin sliced, so it cooked fast.
[02:43.520 --> 02:45.620]  I don't feel like I have a skillet to do steak,
[02:46.140 --> 02:48.180]  but I should look into the Ninja thing, I guess.
[02:48.260 --> 02:48.980]  Maybe. I don't know.
[02:49.220 --> 02:50.400]  Yeah, steak. Steak is good.
[02:50.600 --> 02:52.320]  Ninja doesn't just chop stuff anymore.
[02:52.400 --> 02:53.040]  They do other stuff.
[02:53.380 --> 02:54.460]  Yeah, dude, I bought it.
[02:54.580 --> 02:59.340]  I bought like the 2025 version of the electric George Foreman grill.
[02:59.560 --> 03:00.300]  What's happening?
[03:00.760 --> 03:02.180]  And it's like a grill.
[03:02.240 --> 03:03.040]  It's a smoker.
[03:03.740 --> 03:05.980]  It's an air fryer all in one.
[03:06.340 --> 03:09.900]  And what if we have to throw a regulation flag in the middle of a sausage talk?
[03:09.940 --> 03:12.300]  Is this is this a fucking episode?
[03:12.500 --> 03:13.740]  What is going on?
[03:13.740 --> 03:16.060]  The episode, the last episode was very sausage heavy.
[03:16.300 --> 03:18.120]  Yeah, this sausage is very episode heavy.
[03:18.280 --> 03:18.860]  I'm going to be honest.
[03:19.380 --> 03:20.120]  I don't know.
[03:20.260 --> 03:22.260]  I truly I don't know what a sausage talk is.
[03:22.400 --> 03:25.340]  We've done however many of those still don't really get it.
[03:25.640 --> 03:26.580]  You're the question guy.
[03:26.640 --> 03:27.120]  What do you mean?
[03:28.740 --> 03:29.180]  What do you mean?
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.480]  Gather that you gather the sausage meat.
[03:31.880 --> 03:32.740]  No, I understand.
[03:32.860 --> 03:34.400]  I gather the sausage meat for the thing.
[03:34.660 --> 03:37.640]  And I understand the idea of like production talk.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.060]  But I just I never fully know.
[03:40.340 --> 03:41.440]  Well, what to what extent?
[03:41.440 --> 03:43.240]  It sounds like you understand the podcast.
[03:43.240 --> 03:45.840]  Then you get you just described sausage talk.
[03:45.940 --> 03:46.540]  He nailed it.
[03:47.200 --> 03:47.880]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.780]  I got off on a tangent because Andrew asked me about my grill.
[03:50.980 --> 03:52.400]  And I'm really into that grill.
[03:52.480 --> 03:54.200]  I made some fucking asparagus the other night.
[03:54.320 --> 03:54.800]  It was boring.
[03:54.980 --> 03:57.080]  And again, you're doing your own asking it again.
[03:57.540 --> 04:00.720]  Would you say you're ready to take the mantle of grill master again?
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.620]  Yeah, I'm getting up there.
[04:02.680 --> 04:03.980]  I'm getting pretty close to it for sure.
[04:04.580 --> 04:09.400]  But I believe Gavin called sausage because recently we went
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.420]  for our yearly boat outing.
[04:13.540 --> 04:17.480]  And as we do most times on the boat, we came up with a bunch of dumb ideas
[04:17.480 --> 04:20.820]  and we compiled them all and we were going to dive into them drafts
[04:20.820 --> 04:22.800]  and what have you on the episode.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.020]  But it seemed like so much that it would probably dominate the episode.
[04:26.060 --> 04:29.140]  And it felt like it made more sense to do over here on a sausage talk
[04:29.140 --> 04:32.800]  as Andrew so eloquently described the purpose of earlier.
[04:33.740 --> 04:37.140]  And Eric said he's got a sausage or two he wants to throw onto the pile.
[04:38.460 --> 04:40.960]  Andrew, hopefully you've got one or two you want to cook up.
[04:41.020 --> 04:42.740]  I know we have some questions as well.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.100]  Oh, yeah, I got the questions.
[04:44.520 --> 04:47.180]  So we're going through these ideas and it's the thought like we're going
[04:47.180 --> 04:50.160]  to gladiator style, thumbs up, thumbs down, figure it out or like what?
[04:50.680 --> 04:52.240]  What's the the overall goal?
[04:52.520 --> 04:56.620]  I think we have to just pitch them so that we all are aware of them
[04:56.620 --> 05:00.200]  in the universe and then hopefully they will find their way into the bit barrel.
[05:00.240 --> 05:03.100]  Speaking of the bit barrel, an audience member
[05:03.820 --> 05:06.440]  gave me a suggestion that I've been holding on to
[05:06.440 --> 05:08.500]  because I wanted to talk about in sausage talk, felt like this is
[05:08.500 --> 05:10.540]  it's I think it's a brilliant idea.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.820]  Hit us with it.
[05:12.140 --> 05:14.140]  Someone named I read his name down, their name down.
[05:14.520 --> 05:19.600]  Kelsmont on my stream the other day said we should have a go to second barrel
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.900]  option, like one of the pieces of paper should be go to second barrel.
[05:24.120 --> 05:26.180]  And then we have a second smaller barrel.
[05:26.360 --> 05:29.220]  I don't know what's in that barrel, but I cannot wait to find out.
[05:29.500 --> 05:32.280]  I like the idea of having like a cup.
[05:32.380 --> 05:34.680]  One of the cupboards has just has the second barrel in it.
[05:35.280 --> 05:39.560]  When it very rarely has to be wheeled out, it's like dusty and shitty.
[05:39.800 --> 05:40.940]  Yeah, it's a great idea.
[05:41.500 --> 05:44.780]  What did the second barrel is just a barrel that's a fire pit.
[05:45.160 --> 05:46.660]  And if you get to go to second barrel,
[05:47.120 --> 05:49.360]  you then have to pull something from the bit barrel
[05:49.360 --> 05:52.240]  and whatever gets pulled goes into the pit and it's gone.
[05:52.640 --> 05:53.160]  You lose the bit.
[05:53.240 --> 05:55.460]  You burn the bit. So it's like a burn barrel.
[05:55.860 --> 05:57.780]  It's like a burn barrel fruit for bits.
[05:58.200 --> 06:01.540]  But if you go to second barrel, that means a bit is getting killed.
[06:01.920 --> 06:03.280]  Yeah, that's a crazy idea.
[06:03.280 --> 06:06.320]  I love that. Like, and it might be your favorite bit.
[06:06.420 --> 06:08.860]  It might be a thing we're pumped about, but it's fucking it's gone.
[06:09.020 --> 06:10.340]  Yeah, it was that's the most distract.
[06:10.440 --> 06:13.280]  That's like the most destructive thing we've ever pitched here on this show.
[06:13.360 --> 06:14.360]  I really like that.
[06:14.620 --> 06:16.880]  It's like the way that the moon, not moon draft is cursed.
[06:17.020 --> 06:18.640]  Maybe this is like, oh, you know what?
[06:18.680 --> 06:19.900]  This actually this would have been cursed.
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.680]  We had to get rid of it. This is the universe.
[06:22.060 --> 06:25.040]  But what if it's a really good bit and it's heading for the burn barrel?
[06:25.280 --> 06:30.440]  What if everyone has an angel barrel that they can save?
[06:30.440 --> 06:36.120]  Oh, I think if it was a really good bit and it was in the bit barrel,
[06:36.260 --> 06:37.160]  it wasn't that good of a bit.
[06:37.540 --> 06:39.800]  Oh, wow. So it's like a shit bit barrel.
[06:40.040 --> 06:44.140]  Here's my the only way that you can persuade me as if the angel barrel
[06:44.140 --> 06:46.440]  that you're describing is a burnable item
[06:46.440 --> 06:49.500]  that you have to then replace for the burn barrel.
[06:49.840 --> 06:51.760]  So you burn that and it's gone.
[06:52.160 --> 06:55.280]  It's a physical like you're still something always needs to be burned
[06:55.280 --> 06:56.520]  when you go to the second barrel.
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.620]  But you can intervene and put your angel save or whatever
[07:00.620 --> 07:02.420]  in the burn barrel instead.
[07:02.840 --> 07:06.380]  And then how do how do we incorporate shot in the dark into this?
[07:06.820 --> 07:08.740]  Here I can get Eric on board really quickly.
[07:08.900 --> 07:11.960]  We're going to have the angel save be little ratty boys
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.900]  that you could throw into the fire.
[07:14.880 --> 07:16.800]  We're never going to be able to hang on to them.
[07:16.860 --> 07:18.280]  They're all going in the fire day one.
[07:18.780 --> 07:21.600]  So it's like save a bit, burn a rat sort of swap.
[07:21.860 --> 07:23.960]  Save a bit, burn a rat.
[07:24.120 --> 07:25.680]  I like there you go. I love it.
[07:28.500 --> 07:29.760]  Now, as I was
[07:29.760 --> 07:30.820]  as I was
[07:32.540 --> 07:35.160]  such a go to second barrel in the bit barrel.
[07:36.300 --> 07:38.960]  All right. So we've decided go to second barrel as a thing.
[07:39.020 --> 07:40.040]  OK, good. Yeah.
[07:40.220 --> 07:42.500]  Well, thank you again, Kelzmont, for that recommendation.
[07:42.640 --> 07:43.760]  I thought that was fucking awesome.
[07:47.860 --> 07:51.080]  Let me try to go to where the drafts were.
[07:51.200 --> 07:55.000]  OK, so God damn, I have so many other dumb ideas here, too.
[07:56.400 --> 08:00.640]  OK, the first idea I have here is a fads draft.
[08:01.380 --> 08:02.880]  We came up with it on the boat.
[08:03.080 --> 08:07.500]  Fads draft, fads from your childhood, you know, like pegging your jeans
[08:07.500 --> 08:10.280]  or in Gavin's case, just getting pegged.
[08:10.280 --> 08:12.100]  I know, but like that was the example.
[08:12.320 --> 08:15.000]  And that really, I think half the audience just went, huh?
[08:15.780 --> 08:16.340]  Hold on a second.
[08:17.200 --> 08:18.240]  Pegging your jeans?
[08:18.540 --> 08:21.500]  You could have said pogs, could have said pogs, could have said pogs.
[08:22.640 --> 08:25.320]  I didn't have the pogs weren't a trend when I was growing up.
[08:26.000 --> 08:28.060]  This. You do that to your jeans?
[08:28.240 --> 08:29.440]  There you go. Pegging in jeans.
[08:30.620 --> 08:31.500]  OK, yeah.
[08:32.220 --> 08:34.700]  It's a shame you can't see the strap on further up the picture.
[08:49.570 --> 08:51.250]  Oh, Christ, that's great, Gavin.
[08:52.270 --> 08:55.970]  So anyway, getting pegged as an example, as a fad.
[08:55.970 --> 09:00.930]  So that would be your first pick, getting pegged, getting pegged.
[09:01.070 --> 09:03.410]  The jelly bracelets probably after that.
[09:04.370 --> 09:07.650]  But, you know, so a fads draft, just like everybody drafts fads
[09:07.650 --> 09:11.350]  from their life or the that they experienced or whatever comes to mind.
[09:11.530 --> 09:13.590]  That seems like a no brainer.
[09:13.790 --> 09:15.110]  Here's my gladiator vote.
[09:15.790 --> 09:18.450]  OK, that can go in the bit barrel, I feel like.
[09:19.090 --> 09:20.650]  Yeah. Put that in the bit barrel.
[09:21.130 --> 09:23.330]  Are you marking it or should I be marking it?
[09:23.750 --> 09:25.110]  You mark it. OK.
[09:27.010 --> 09:27.910]  Oh, wait, wait.
[09:27.990 --> 09:29.490]  This isn't going in the bit barrel, is it?
[09:29.650 --> 09:30.410]  Because this is a draft.
[09:30.470 --> 09:32.030]  No, this is something we can just do.
[09:32.170 --> 09:32.950]  I'm just going to mark it.
[09:32.990 --> 09:34.410]  So I know we can go back to it.
[09:34.730 --> 09:37.410]  Yeah. Geoff is flying by the seat of his pants,
[09:37.410 --> 09:38.890]  but you have to allow him to do it.
[09:38.930 --> 09:39.750]  So we can do this.
[09:40.190 --> 09:42.630]  I think it's only if we were like three months down the line
[09:42.630 --> 09:44.690]  and we've forgotten about this, does it end up in the bit barrel?
[09:45.170 --> 09:49.070]  Yeah. And I also think we should maybe have a little evening with the Falcons,
[09:49.830 --> 09:53.050]  just like when we made the summer playlist, which we tested out this weekend.
[09:53.130 --> 09:53.910]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[09:53.910 --> 09:58.330]  And we'll have them help us with the the old dropped bits for the barrel.
[09:58.450 --> 09:59.430]  Oh, that's a great idea.
[09:59.570 --> 10:01.010]  It's a great idea. Absolutely.
[10:01.910 --> 10:06.170]  As I'm looking at ideas like make mustard to go in the deviled egg off,
[10:06.290 --> 10:07.810]  which is two ideas in one.
[10:08.610 --> 10:11.250]  Are these just ideas that you have somewhere else
[10:11.250 --> 10:13.510]  and not on the list of regulation, Idea Bank?
[10:13.910 --> 10:14.390]  No, no, no.
[10:14.390 --> 10:18.470]  I have the idea of the stuff that we're talking about, the drafts from the boat.
[10:18.550 --> 10:22.870]  I'm just looking up and I see the deviled egg off on a different list.
[10:22.870 --> 10:24.550]  And I was like, oh, yeah, we got to do the deviled egg off.
[10:24.830 --> 10:27.370]  I was using it as an example. Next one.
[10:28.670 --> 10:30.450]  This was Barbara's idea.
[10:30.550 --> 10:32.790]  This was Eric's small wife's idea.
[10:32.850 --> 10:34.190]  We called it Andrew's list.
[10:36.130 --> 10:40.770]  Andrew creates a bunch of prompts of questions that need to be answered.
[10:41.430 --> 10:44.910]  All of the questions go into a hat or a bit barrel
[10:44.910 --> 10:48.230]  where we randomly pull like three questions out.
[10:48.230 --> 10:52.550]  And then through the course of a podcast or let's play recording,
[10:53.090 --> 10:56.570]  our job is to get the answer to these secret questions
[10:56.570 --> 10:59.690]  from the other members we're recording with without them
[10:59.690 --> 11:01.490]  figuring out that that's what we're asking.
[11:02.230 --> 11:04.210]  I like it. Did I explain that well?
[11:04.450 --> 11:05.650]  You explained it perfectly.
[11:05.990 --> 11:06.950]  Oh, you didn't ask me.
[11:07.930 --> 11:10.630]  Well, it's Eric's wife's idea, and he was there when she pitched it.
[11:10.650 --> 11:13.410]  So I just want to I was asking him if I explained it well.
[11:15.170 --> 11:16.210]  I think you did great.
[11:16.710 --> 11:19.210]  OK, Eric, are you doing something else?
[11:19.930 --> 11:21.550]  Nope. I am. I'm waiting.
[11:21.770 --> 11:24.170]  I'm waiting for it to wrap up because Geoff was asking me.
[11:24.290 --> 11:25.370]  Andrew wanted to answer.
[11:25.670 --> 11:27.250]  And I'm just checking on what's going on.
[11:27.470 --> 11:29.770]  It's tough when there's no immediate feedback, huh?
[11:30.450 --> 11:33.530]  Yeah, that was that was a good impression by you, Gavin.
[11:33.590 --> 11:35.570]  That's what it's like. That's that's our end.
[11:35.910 --> 11:38.690]  That's what we hear. Just nothing.
[11:39.890 --> 11:40.710]  I don't know why.
[11:40.870 --> 11:43.850]  When you put out a question to the group and no one says anything,
[11:44.030 --> 11:45.390]  you come you come straight for me.
[11:45.750 --> 11:47.630]  Oh, because you never do, even when it's at you.
[11:48.910 --> 11:49.490]  That's why.
[11:49.850 --> 11:52.890]  Because you're the one that I'm most worried about not saying something,
[11:52.970 --> 11:55.710]  not speaking up in the moment and having something to say about it later.
[11:55.950 --> 11:58.190]  So I just want to make sure that I get buy in at that point,
[11:58.230 --> 11:59.690]  because that's when we're discussing it.
[12:00.230 --> 12:03.610]  I feel like it doesn't happen in person because in person,
[12:03.610 --> 12:08.230]  I often would put my hand up by my chin and sort of look up as I'm thinking.
[12:08.430 --> 12:09.530]  But you can't see that on display.
[12:10.030 --> 12:12.530]  Do you want to? You should turn on your camera, I suppose.
[12:13.110 --> 12:14.290]  Oh, yeah. I don't know.
[12:14.290 --> 12:15.450]  I don't always have an answer.
[12:15.890 --> 12:18.330]  Forty five milliseconds after you stop talking.
[12:18.390 --> 12:20.090]  Let me think about it. Not 45 milliseconds.
[12:20.690 --> 12:23.990]  There was an example today in the meeting where there was something
[12:23.990 --> 12:27.450]  talked about with all of you and every other person said yes,
[12:27.810 --> 12:31.310]  except you, until someone specifically asked you.
[12:31.750 --> 12:34.730]  To be honest, if three people have said yes, then that's what's happening.
[12:35.350 --> 12:37.210]  Exactly. But that's not.
[12:38.950 --> 12:40.570]  I mean, majority rules.
[12:41.230 --> 12:42.470]  It's not how that works.
[12:42.470 --> 12:45.230]  If you need to agree with them for a second there.
[12:45.590 --> 12:48.270]  If you want your fourth, OK, I can throw it in, but it's happening.
[12:48.410 --> 12:51.310]  I always want the OK from you if you're OK with it,
[12:51.310 --> 12:55.030]  because you're dreaming if you think you're dreaming,
[12:55.170 --> 12:58.170]  if you think that it's not going to be a thing where if you don't want to do it
[12:58.170 --> 12:59.770]  or you have a problem with it or whatever,
[13:00.230 --> 13:02.730]  that it's not going to be a thing we we have to figure out later.
[13:02.890 --> 13:04.390]  And I don't mind doing that.
[13:04.390 --> 13:07.210]  But it's just that we're in the middle of talking about it then.
[13:07.510 --> 13:09.930]  So I'm trying to just get an answer from you at that point.
[13:09.930 --> 13:13.430]  If I'm in a dinner party and everybody but you says yes,
[13:13.770 --> 13:17.070]  I'm not going to assume that you're also coming to the dinner party.
[13:18.770 --> 13:22.490]  I can't just put a plate down and be like, well, everyone said, yes,
[13:22.510 --> 13:24.090]  it's happening, Gavin's going to be here.
[13:25.150 --> 13:25.890]  It's crazy.
[13:26.850 --> 13:29.970]  OK, so it's kind of like like an RSVP to a wedding kind of thing.
[13:30.490 --> 13:32.370]  It's just a basic communication thing.
[13:32.410 --> 13:35.130]  I feel like I don't get the RSVP.
[13:35.890 --> 13:38.010]  But you need you need someone to say yes or no, though, right?
[13:38.010 --> 13:38.850]  If they're invited.
[13:40.290 --> 13:44.130]  I think if there's an activity and you're expecting a reply by that person.
[13:44.210 --> 13:45.070]  Yeah, like a wedding.
[13:46.510 --> 13:46.910]  Sure.
[13:51.650 --> 13:52.430]  That's crazy, man.
[13:52.450 --> 13:53.170]  Are you talking about Jack?
[13:53.610 --> 13:57.430]  So the way I the way I see it working, because it has to be
[13:57.430 --> 14:00.490]  it has to be funneled into a game in some way.
[14:00.530 --> 14:02.190]  Right. Which means there has to be stakes.
[14:02.230 --> 14:03.850]  So I'm going to take an example.
[14:04.530 --> 14:07.390]  Andrew's one of Andrew's questions is get find out
[14:07.390 --> 14:09.290]  the name of Gavin's first girlfriend.
[14:09.550 --> 14:13.010]  And so then you have to figure out how to get that question answered
[14:13.010 --> 14:16.830]  in the process of recording episode 68 of the podcast or whatever.
[14:17.090 --> 14:19.970]  If Gavin says, hey, wait a minute, are you asking a question from the hat
[14:19.970 --> 14:21.010]  and he catches you?
[14:21.070 --> 14:22.150]  That's a strike against you.
[14:22.550 --> 14:25.650]  But if he calls a strike and you're like, no, I just was really curious
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.270]  about your first girlfriend's name.
[14:27.470 --> 14:28.590]  And that's a strike against him.
[14:28.670 --> 14:30.190]  So you got to be careful with your strike.
[14:30.410 --> 14:33.610]  It's such a good idea to get us back to like a paranoid era.
[14:33.910 --> 14:35.770]  Yeah, is like you never know.
[14:35.770 --> 14:39.590]  And so you're asking false flag questions because you want to trip people up.
[14:39.730 --> 14:42.030]  Yeah, but you also yeah, you know what I mean?
[14:42.090 --> 14:45.110]  And then so say you get like two or three questions, everybody pulled
[14:45.110 --> 14:47.890]  and then the first person to get all three answers wins the metagame.
[14:48.050 --> 14:50.270]  And that's what that content is called.
[14:50.470 --> 14:54.210]  Andrew's list, if everybody's OK with that, then Eric can put it on the board.
[14:54.310 --> 14:55.410]  I'm putting it on the board right now.
[14:55.470 --> 14:58.150]  I feel like we have to have a better name than Andrew's list,
[14:58.170 --> 15:00.970]  because when you said Andrew's list, I didn't remember immediately what it was.
[15:01.250 --> 15:02.750]  I mean, is it for everyone or just for Andrew?
[15:03.350 --> 15:05.690]  We talked about having Andrew come up with all the prompts,
[15:05.870 --> 15:07.610]  but it could be Gracie, too, that does it.
[15:07.630 --> 15:08.650]  So they're like questions.
[15:09.650 --> 15:12.770]  Yeah, so it would be it's you're just trying to
[15:13.550 --> 15:18.290]  you give everyone a different question to try to get an answer to during the
[15:19.130 --> 15:21.730]  during like this recording and.
[15:22.930 --> 15:27.790]  It has to be something that's like a little off the wall, but about someone
[15:27.790 --> 15:31.670]  like I think I think a little bit like personal without being too, too personal.
[15:31.670 --> 15:35.470]  And we're just trying to get that information for you
[15:35.930 --> 15:39.230]  in that recording and whoever does it wins without being caught.
[15:39.370 --> 15:40.470]  Yeah, without getting caught. Yeah.
[15:40.570 --> 15:43.990]  If Andrew asked me how I got started in slow-mo, I'm going to be real suspicious.
[15:45.270 --> 15:48.010]  But it could also be Gracie's list if Andrew wants to play.
[15:48.510 --> 15:49.610]  It doesn't matter to me.
[15:49.710 --> 15:50.530]  It's just like the genesis.
[15:50.810 --> 15:53.430]  I think that the point is just the game. Right, right, right.
[15:53.510 --> 15:55.550]  No, I'm just I'm just thinking of trying to think of a better name
[15:55.550 --> 15:59.270]  that's not indicative of one person, because I think that throws it.
[15:59.270 --> 16:01.290]  If it's like questions from a hat, you know.
[16:01.730 --> 16:05.990]  So I'm trying to I'm trying to get a piece of information
[16:05.990 --> 16:10.190]  stated by by one of you to another person, essentially, like I'm trying to prompt.
[16:11.130 --> 16:13.030]  An answer, is that what I'm doing?
[16:13.630 --> 16:18.770]  You are secretly giving each of us a prompt that we are trying to get the answer to.
[16:18.990 --> 16:24.150]  So for in Geoff's example, say you give me the question of, hey, Eric,
[16:24.150 --> 16:26.950]  I need you to find out the name of Gavin's first girlfriend.
[16:27.430 --> 16:30.410]  So and we all at that same time got it.
[16:30.470 --> 16:33.810]  You've given the other three guys a different thing that doesn't
[16:33.810 --> 16:34.830]  maybe doesn't have to do with Gavin.
[16:34.970 --> 16:38.050]  Maybe it's Nick trying to get something for me or Gavin trying to get something
[16:38.050 --> 16:41.010]  from Geoff, whatever the number of my little league number or whatever.
[16:41.010 --> 16:43.610]  Yeah, I yeah. So I wasn't got it.
[16:43.690 --> 16:48.030]  I was thinking initially that these were just questions I had about the universe.
[16:48.510 --> 16:50.990]  See, that's why I think Andrew's list is a tough name.
[16:51.170 --> 16:52.230]  Right, right, right.
[16:52.270 --> 16:55.150]  Because Andrew has a lot of questions about the idea and he started
[16:55.150 --> 16:58.570]  and he began making a list with with some answers, but mostly questions.
[16:59.030 --> 17:00.370]  Yes, that's true.
[17:00.790 --> 17:03.150]  But would you rather play Andrew or do the prompts?
[17:03.570 --> 17:05.090]  I love doing the prompts.
[17:05.250 --> 17:07.650]  Andrew's answers are questions, which makes it a little harder.
[17:08.390 --> 17:12.870]  I was just wondering if the the concept of lightning doesn't strike twice.
[17:13.350 --> 17:15.310]  Was that all related to Benjamin Franklin?
[17:15.830 --> 17:19.750]  Because he's the most famous old person that I can think of
[17:19.750 --> 17:21.370]  that was struck by lightning.
[17:21.550 --> 17:23.610]  The most famous old person?
[17:23.610 --> 17:28.510]  Well, he's the oldest known person, lightning strike that I'm aware of.
[17:28.590 --> 17:32.730]  I'm not aware of any other like known celebrities or like known figures
[17:32.730 --> 17:34.170]  that were struck by lightning.
[17:34.890 --> 17:37.690]  My favorite old person celebrity is Ben Franklin.
[17:38.690 --> 17:39.810]  Oh, he's not my favorite.
[17:40.030 --> 17:42.810]  I don't have real I don't I don't know a lot about the man
[17:42.810 --> 17:45.750]  outside of the key and electricity and all that. But.
[17:47.390 --> 17:51.090]  I was just curious if like, oh, well, he lived the rest of his life
[17:51.090 --> 17:52.490]  without getting shocked again.
[17:52.610 --> 17:53.830]  Must not happen twice.
[17:54.690 --> 17:55.870]  Where did that come from?
[17:56.150 --> 17:57.550]  Where did lightning doesn't strike twice?
[17:57.650 --> 17:59.970]  Like there must have been something they referenced.
[18:00.470 --> 18:03.050]  Did nobody just know anyone that got struck by lightning twice?
[18:03.150 --> 18:04.110]  Someone must have got struck.
[18:04.130 --> 18:06.530]  So I'm just checking. So is this an episode or no?
[18:07.750 --> 18:09.430]  It's a question that I was thinking of.
[18:09.470 --> 18:12.550]  I was just giving an example of when you when I initially heard this idea
[18:12.550 --> 18:14.930]  of what questions I would put out there.
[18:15.070 --> 18:17.990]  That's that's what you had. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:18.250 --> 18:20.890]  Yeah. These have to be, I think, a little bit more pointed or more directed.
[18:20.890 --> 18:23.270]  So, yeah, I think we just need a better name for it.
[18:23.310 --> 18:23.930]  I think that's it.
[18:24.350 --> 18:25.890]  It sounds like two different shows.
[18:26.210 --> 18:28.070]  Right. What Andrew's talking about is a different thing.
[18:28.150 --> 18:29.170]  And that's why he needed clarification.
[18:29.710 --> 18:31.150]  I get it now.
[18:32.370 --> 18:33.650]  Gavin, do you get it now?
[18:34.770 --> 18:38.330]  Yeah, I just I just really want to play Andrew's version of Andrew's List.
[18:40.230 --> 18:41.710]  OK, I'm sending out Gavin.
[18:41.770 --> 18:42.310]  You got homework.
[18:42.710 --> 18:45.370]  Who is the first famous person to get shocked by lightning?
[18:46.970 --> 18:49.430]  But he wasn't old when he got struck by lightning, was he?
[18:49.950 --> 18:51.650]  No, it wasn't about him being old.
[18:51.750 --> 18:55.010]  It was about the fact that so much time has passed since then.
[18:55.210 --> 18:57.410]  Oh, so someone from the past is old. Yes.
[18:57.910 --> 19:02.610]  I mean, in the end, like if you look at the existence of the world linearly,
[19:03.050 --> 19:06.430]  he's the first celebrity that I'm aware of that was struck by lightning.
[19:06.890 --> 19:09.930]  So like Jesus was old, even though he died in his 30s or whatever.
[19:10.410 --> 19:14.350]  I guess if you put it in the context of average life expectancy at that time.
[19:14.410 --> 19:16.390]  Yeah, I wasn't thinking that way.
[19:16.550 --> 19:19.030]  I think the average life expectancy was only around 30 back then.
[19:20.070 --> 19:22.830]  Eric just posted a fantastic suggestion for the game.
[19:22.890 --> 19:26.470]  We're not currently playing, but yes, the other game that we were talking about.
[19:26.590 --> 19:27.850]  I want to call it Regulation Spy.
[19:28.070 --> 19:30.130]  I think that's great. OK, great name.
[19:30.650 --> 19:32.270]  Cool. I love it. OK.
[19:32.670 --> 19:35.770]  Calling Ben Franklin famous is like blowing my mind.
[19:35.890 --> 19:37.610]  I don't know why. He's pretty good.
[19:37.910 --> 19:39.130]  No, no, no. He's very famous.
[19:39.310 --> 19:41.650]  It's just that motherfuckers in an assassin's creed.
[19:41.910 --> 19:45.210]  Like you keep going to like this celebrity.
[19:45.830 --> 19:48.410]  And it's like really spinning my head up.
[19:48.410 --> 19:49.990]  I don't get.
[19:50.330 --> 19:54.010]  I guess I just never considered him a celebrity, but I suppose he is a celeb.
[19:55.310 --> 19:57.030]  That was probably gossip about him.
[19:57.150 --> 19:58.270]  TMZ was back then.
[19:58.350 --> 19:59.130]  He'd be all over it.
[19:59.170 --> 20:01.250]  Him and Einstein fucking crazy.
[20:01.650 --> 20:03.050]  Need the Ben Franklin blind items.
[20:03.650 --> 20:07.210]  OK, so so Regulation Spy locked in.
[20:07.390 --> 20:08.730]  We're good. I think that's a thumbs up.
[20:09.150 --> 20:12.270]  OK, the next one is this.
[20:13.790 --> 20:15.790]  This is my personal favorite out of all of them.
[20:18.410 --> 20:19.870]  I think I know what it is.
[20:19.970 --> 20:20.670]  I'm getting ready.
[20:22.390 --> 20:25.090]  It might be quick, but it's going to be good.
[20:25.550 --> 20:28.690]  It is the what number am I thinking of draft?
[20:28.950 --> 20:31.890]  I voted. I think of and I think of a number.
[20:32.330 --> 20:34.750]  And then you have we'd snake draft.
[20:35.170 --> 20:37.350]  You try to guess what number I'm thinking of.
[20:37.670 --> 20:38.690]  So we have a six.
[20:38.910 --> 20:44.830]  We have a six of 20 in an infinite chance of getting this right.
[20:45.210 --> 20:46.290]  A 20 out of infinity.
[20:46.690 --> 20:47.830]  Somebody will get closest.
[20:48.490 --> 20:52.650]  Well, of course, everybody's got five chances.
[20:53.030 --> 20:56.090]  Meg heard this idea on the boat and just thought it was the dumbest thing
[20:56.090 --> 20:56.650]  she's ever heard.
[20:56.750 --> 20:59.690]  And then she suggested a follow up draft called what?
[21:03.310 --> 21:04.190]  Drafting anything.
[21:04.690 --> 21:07.590]  Just, you know, I really like the idea.
[21:07.670 --> 21:09.230]  I don't know if it needs to be a draft.
[21:09.450 --> 21:10.990]  What number am I thinking of draft?
[21:11.490 --> 21:15.230]  But I think it's really I think I think a tournament would be fun.
[21:16.170 --> 21:18.210]  OK, I could be I can be into that.
[21:18.890 --> 21:21.590]  Well, do you do we have a range, Geoff, of what you're thinking
[21:21.590 --> 21:25.730]  as far as the number goes somewhere between one and infinity?
[21:26.170 --> 21:27.690]  Yeah, I think it's got to be.
[21:28.210 --> 21:30.150]  Yeah, I think it has to be positive numbers.
[21:30.390 --> 21:31.970]  All like all are on the table.
[21:32.590 --> 21:33.150]  Every number.
[21:33.810 --> 21:34.890]  But I don't think that high.
[21:35.010 --> 21:36.990]  So, you know, you know, I'm not going in the millions.
[21:37.190 --> 21:38.910]  I'm probably going to be somewhere in the thousands.
[21:39.510 --> 21:43.190]  But you're going to set a ceiling of infinity and not hit up the millions.
[21:44.010 --> 21:44.810]  Yeah, it's too bad.
[21:44.890 --> 21:46.010]  It's too much to keep up with.
[21:46.010 --> 21:46.670]  So many numbers.
[21:47.250 --> 21:48.190]  I'm a simple man.
[21:48.470 --> 21:49.390]  I think there's a great.
[21:50.310 --> 21:52.990]  Just because I have a just because I like a high ceiling
[21:52.990 --> 21:54.490]  doesn't mean I want to touch it.
[21:55.670 --> 21:56.330]  That's fair.
[21:56.630 --> 21:57.510]  Sometimes you just want to look.
[21:57.830 --> 22:02.470]  I think that this should reverse in a way where it also becomes a burden to Geoff.
[22:02.850 --> 22:04.670]  I think we all need to be burdened by this.
[22:04.770 --> 22:06.530]  That's why I like this is a burden to me, Andrew.
[22:06.690 --> 22:12.030]  But I don't want a scenario where anybody kind of wins.
[22:13.710 --> 22:15.290]  We're doing that thing.
[22:15.290 --> 22:18.330]  And I assume we're going to put a cap on how long it can go.
[22:18.650 --> 22:20.050]  But we're doing the mile high club.
[22:20.270 --> 22:22.890]  You can't leave until you complete it.
[22:22.910 --> 22:25.830]  But I assume that it's going to be like, well, you know, within five hours
[22:25.830 --> 22:27.150]  or whatever, it's just you lose.
[22:27.510 --> 22:30.070]  Wait, why five hours?
[22:30.810 --> 22:33.430]  He's he's throwing he's just throwing a number out.
[22:33.670 --> 22:34.390]  It'll be a number.
[22:34.510 --> 22:38.390]  That there will be a cap that like you, you there is an end to this.
[22:38.450 --> 22:39.370]  Even if you can't beat it.
[22:39.410 --> 22:42.050]  I think he's so offended if you end the level.
[22:43.130 --> 22:45.090]  Well, yeah, but I think that there's a huge
[22:45.090 --> 22:48.330]  advantage for some of us that that it's not all shared.
[22:48.470 --> 22:50.590]  Like, I think it's unfair to Eric and Nick, who have never tried it.
[22:50.890 --> 22:52.550]  I've done it two or three times.
[22:52.710 --> 22:53.910]  You and Geoff have both done it.
[22:54.310 --> 22:57.750]  Nick and Eric are great at games.
[22:57.810 --> 23:01.230]  It's just I feel, I don't know, bad having a not like
[23:01.830 --> 23:04.270]  end point for them if they can't complete it.
[23:04.770 --> 23:06.550]  But what if they're like 30 hours in?
[23:06.850 --> 23:09.310]  That's a that's that's a funny face.
[23:09.830 --> 23:11.150]  Yeah, but they're not going to be.
[23:11.490 --> 23:14.010]  Yeah, that just becomes a Mr. Beast video at that point.
[23:14.570 --> 23:15.450]  Nick is kids.
[23:15.630 --> 23:19.010]  Eric is not going to be playing Call of Duty for 30 hours to try to beat it.
[23:19.370 --> 23:22.050]  Like there will be a natural breaking point for these people.
[23:22.250 --> 23:25.290]  So I think it's better instead of having them have to quit,
[23:25.430 --> 23:28.970]  just have an end and say, hey, this will end after.
[23:29.350 --> 23:31.250]  Like we're up against the clock, like we have to do it.
[23:31.330 --> 23:34.850]  Yes. But anyone else can leave whenever they're done.
[23:34.910 --> 23:39.230]  It's just it creates a scenario in which it's not solely on the person
[23:39.230 --> 23:41.110]  and is like it isn't understood.
[23:41.990 --> 23:43.930]  You're spending a ridiculous amount of time.
[23:44.010 --> 23:48.050]  Now, maybe you can make the argument that they have to go back and try again,
[23:48.150 --> 23:51.590]  that they can't leave it, but like their sessions essentially.
[23:51.710 --> 23:55.410]  So let's say Nick doesn't beat it within six hours.
[23:55.690 --> 23:58.650]  Then he stops and then we pick it up another time.
[23:58.670 --> 23:59.590]  And it's just Nick.
[23:59.690 --> 24:00.650]  And he has to do it again.
[24:00.750 --> 24:02.010]  He has six more hours to do it.
[24:02.150 --> 24:05.270]  And he can't get out of that cycle until he completes it.
[24:05.310 --> 24:09.230]  What if the show is called Clock Out, but you have to clock in for 10 hour shifts
[24:09.230 --> 24:10.190]  before you clock out?
[24:10.570 --> 24:12.230]  Fantastic! 10 hour shifts!
[24:12.230 --> 24:15.090]  I mean, what's a normal workday length?
[24:15.650 --> 24:16.350]  Eight. Eight.
[24:17.770 --> 24:18.910]  Eight working hours.
[24:19.090 --> 24:21.430]  Yeah, you seem. Is it?
[24:21.550 --> 24:24.050]  Hey, why? Why is that?
[24:24.410 --> 24:24.970]  Why is that?
[24:25.090 --> 24:28.690]  Mr. Unregulation Takes wants to take out CEOs is now
[24:28.690 --> 24:31.250]  demanding everyone has a 10 hour workday.
[24:31.510 --> 24:34.030]  I don't know about anything, I just, I used to work.
[24:35.690 --> 24:40.550]  Yeah, I guess like waitrose and film sets were much longer than that.
[24:40.550 --> 24:42.890]  Yeah, film sets are way longer than that.
[24:42.970 --> 24:43.330]  Absolutely.
[24:44.310 --> 24:45.690]  But eight is, I think, the traditional.
[24:45.970 --> 24:48.410]  I think eight hours is fair with a lunch.
[24:48.750 --> 24:49.530]  You can take a lunch.
[24:50.170 --> 24:52.190]  You did 11 hours at a grocery store?
[24:52.550 --> 24:53.770]  Yeah, but one hour was lunch.
[24:54.470 --> 24:55.310]  But it'd be 10 paid.
[24:56.410 --> 24:57.030]  Yeah, that was bullshit.
[24:57.130 --> 24:57.930]  Why did I do that for?
[24:58.250 --> 24:59.150]  I don't know.
[24:59.250 --> 25:00.690]  You're the one who just gave it to us.
[25:01.070 --> 25:03.610]  I just thought that was the standard length of a workday.
[25:05.010 --> 25:06.870]  I think maybe like manual labor.
[25:06.990 --> 25:09.370]  I think if we were like day labor guys, we might do 10.
[25:09.830 --> 25:10.610]  I'll do 10.
[25:11.330 --> 25:12.810]  Yeah, I would do 10.
[25:12.850 --> 25:13.370]  I could do 10.
[25:13.630 --> 25:14.410]  I could do 10 right now.
[25:14.530 --> 25:18.150]  Here's the thing, the three of us that are all feeling good about 10
[25:18.150 --> 25:21.970]  also are 100% confident we're not spending 10 hours doing it.
[25:22.070 --> 25:22.390]  No, yeah.
[25:22.430 --> 25:24.010]  You're definitely not going the full 10.
[25:24.330 --> 25:26.750]  Oh, I don't feel very confident in my abilities whatsoever.
[25:27.130 --> 25:30.050]  I thought that was a nightmare that I drug myself along
[25:30.050 --> 25:32.770]  and I was way younger and had better hand-eye coordination then.
[25:32.870 --> 25:34.690]  Yeah, I was in my 20s and it took forever.
[25:34.950 --> 25:37.190]  Let's lock in an hour then right now.
[25:37.290 --> 25:39.170]  I'm happy with whatever you guys want to say.
[25:39.570 --> 25:44.210]  I just think this this new mature Andrew is coming out of nowhere and I love it.
[25:44.810 --> 25:46.610]  He's like putting an end on the bit.
[25:46.730 --> 25:47.510]  I love this.
[25:47.670 --> 25:50.650]  Oh, we just we need it just is like it needs to have an end.
[25:50.990 --> 25:52.790]  And then this will circle back into the number thing.
[25:52.830 --> 25:56.610]  But let's just lock in the hour length for this Mile High Club video
[25:56.610 --> 25:57.190]  that we're going to do.
[25:58.190 --> 25:58.710]  How many hours?
[25:58.890 --> 25:59.670]  Let's split the difference.
[25:59.730 --> 26:00.150]  I'll say nine.
[26:00.670 --> 26:02.250]  What about nine and one is lunch?
[26:02.810 --> 26:03.850]  Nine and one is lunch.
[26:03.970 --> 26:05.690]  I think nine and one is lunch is good.
[26:05.810 --> 26:08.530]  We can all go to Carl's Jr., eat some Famous Stars and come back for whatever.
[26:10.270 --> 26:12.750]  I got to go get some Mountain Dew in me.
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.770]  I need that fuel.
[26:14.070 --> 26:15.250]  I need to get over the edge.
[26:15.610 --> 26:16.090]  That's what it was.
[26:16.510 --> 26:20.210]  OK, so nine hours instead of and one hour for lunch.
[26:20.630 --> 26:24.790]  What if we do we put, Geoff, your pick a number thing
[26:24.790 --> 26:28.630]  and that format as well, and you have a number
[26:29.150 --> 26:31.390]  and we have to try to get it within that.
[26:31.690 --> 26:34.790]  And it's not until until it's said we can't stop.
[26:35.170 --> 26:36.570]  Who is going to listen?
[26:36.730 --> 26:38.330]  Who will listen to this?
[26:38.330 --> 26:41.210]  Who will listen to just four men guessing numbers?
[26:41.730 --> 26:47.110]  I think I think the longer it gets, the more interesting it becomes.
[26:47.470 --> 26:49.410]  Oh, yeah. We'll live stream this.
[26:49.470 --> 26:50.090]  This is a good one.
[26:50.210 --> 26:53.310]  I don't think anyone will be like, I listened to all nine hours.
[26:53.450 --> 26:57.170]  But I think most people will be like, well, this went for nine hours.
[26:57.210 --> 26:58.310]  I got to see what's going on.
[26:58.390 --> 27:02.530]  What Geoff just said, what Geoff just said, I'm into if we live stream it
[27:02.530 --> 27:06.110]  instead of recording, it has lower stakes to me
[27:06.110 --> 27:09.670]  where that's way less interesting to do it as a recorded thing.
[27:09.790 --> 27:12.690]  If we live stream it, that's crazy.
[27:12.910 --> 27:13.730]  And I love it.
[27:13.950 --> 27:16.170]  Well, then that sort of leads to my second question,
[27:16.230 --> 27:18.090]  but it becomes a little bit complicated with gameplay.
[27:18.190 --> 27:22.410]  I guess multiple perspectives are all of these streamed things that we do.
[27:23.370 --> 27:23.850]  Nine hours.
[27:24.330 --> 27:28.650]  I mean, if we can if we can get our lives switched, stream or like split screen
[27:28.650 --> 27:32.450]  set up. Yeah, I think it should be certainly be something to aspire to.
[27:32.830 --> 27:36.090]  I think it theoretically gets easier as people have to drop out.
[27:36.090 --> 27:39.870]  But I know if we have switchers, that would have to be a thing
[27:39.870 --> 27:42.730]  that like Nick operates or something that could be distracting and unfair.
[27:43.270 --> 27:46.490]  Who I could we could get somebody else to come in and watch it.
[27:46.590 --> 27:48.330]  I bet like I got a buddy who'd come and do it.
[27:48.370 --> 27:48.870]  He doesn't. OK.
[27:49.190 --> 27:53.230]  Well, as long as we have somebody that hit buttons monkey style shit.
[27:54.290 --> 27:57.810]  I mean, a split screen would also work if we did like a 4K stream or something.
[27:58.350 --> 27:59.890]  Sure. But it's going to be five perspectives.
[28:00.190 --> 28:01.950]  You think that would fit well?
[28:02.070 --> 28:03.590]  Like, what does that you'll be done?
[28:03.730 --> 28:05.590]  You'll be done within like seven minutes and then it'll be.
[28:05.590 --> 28:09.250]  You know, I'm going to that's who's going to have it in 30 minutes.
[28:10.170 --> 28:12.750]  Gavin will do it in two and a half hours.
[28:12.890 --> 28:14.590]  I'll do it in six and a half hours.
[28:14.590 --> 28:16.110]  And I have no idea about the other two.
[28:16.230 --> 28:17.030]  OK, so we're going to call.
[28:17.150 --> 28:18.570]  But let me just get this one down.
[28:18.950 --> 28:21.110]  What number am I thinking of live stream?
[28:21.250 --> 28:23.150]  We're saying green light. Let's do it.
[28:23.250 --> 28:24.270]  Yeah. Yes. OK.
[28:24.750 --> 28:26.810]  That is what number am I thinking of live stream?
[28:26.910 --> 28:30.210]  And then the description is guess the number.
[28:30.490 --> 28:34.590]  That's it. That's the whole I think it's going to be so funny
[28:34.590 --> 28:38.670]  if let's say we spend an hour doing this and then somebody says like 72
[28:38.670 --> 28:41.370]  and the chat just goes, you've said that six times.
[28:41.510 --> 28:43.970]  Oh, yeah. Already said 72 six times.
[28:44.110 --> 28:45.070]  It's not 72.
[28:45.530 --> 28:47.370]  I've already started looking at
[28:48.030 --> 28:52.650]  or trying to find like a big number sheet that we can like tick off the numbers.
[28:52.870 --> 28:55.850]  So like visually, like there's something that we can like look at.
[28:55.890 --> 28:57.150]  So you can scroll through.
[28:57.710 --> 29:00.970]  You know what I mean? Like, yeah, you have to.
[29:01.270 --> 29:04.290]  Just a shared list that we can all like scroll to and eliminate.
[29:04.290 --> 29:05.030]  Or whatever.
[29:06.590 --> 29:07.630]  So I'm into that.
[29:09.550 --> 29:12.610]  How, Nick, how how hard do you think it would be to get us
[29:13.270 --> 29:16.150]  multi stream ready in this office?
[29:16.850 --> 29:19.830]  Uh, is that like is that out of your wheelhouse?
[29:20.230 --> 29:24.630]  That's not quite what I've done before, but I'll bet you I can figure it out.
[29:25.090 --> 29:26.590]  So a little bit. A while.
[29:26.690 --> 29:27.590]  It's going to take a little bit.
[29:29.510 --> 29:32.550]  That's OK. I'm I'm fine with it, too.
[29:32.610 --> 29:33.690]  I don't want to put it on you.
[29:33.690 --> 29:35.950]  You were just the guy that I leaned on there.
[29:36.330 --> 29:39.310]  If you know anybody that you would feel comfortable
[29:39.310 --> 29:42.050]  contracting to come in and help us set it up, Nick, we'd be
[29:42.050 --> 29:44.630]  I think we'd all be just the guy happy to that. OK, great.
[29:44.850 --> 29:46.370]  Well, what if we put Shaner Lindblad?
[29:47.010 --> 29:50.170]  What if we got splitters, HDMI splitters, right?
[29:50.910 --> 29:53.990]  And coming out of our capture devices, we would split to our monitor
[29:53.990 --> 29:59.410]  and split one off to Nick, who has like a quad capture card or something.
[30:00.250 --> 30:02.170]  Yeah, it would be this other computer over here.
[30:02.270 --> 30:03.530]  Yeah, that's all a doable thing.
[30:03.530 --> 30:04.770]  I don't know how to do it.
[30:04.870 --> 30:08.570]  And so like that, what you just said makes me go, hell yeah.
[30:09.390 --> 30:11.250]  I have no idea. I've never done that.
[30:11.590 --> 30:15.050]  We could also theoretically use vMix again for it.
[30:15.230 --> 30:17.150]  Yeah, because we need to like live stream it or whatever.
[30:17.330 --> 30:21.710]  So like we and then we could just program it to like a stream deck
[30:21.710 --> 30:23.330]  or something to live switch.
[30:24.090 --> 30:25.650]  Gavin was less into that idea.
[30:26.050 --> 30:27.070]  No, no, I just like vMix.
[30:27.150 --> 30:29.850]  I just heard vMix and I just got it's like when you hear Animal Crossing,
[30:29.930 --> 30:31.410]  I just think of COVID and I'm just like,
[30:31.410 --> 30:33.910]  oh, yucky time.
[30:34.530 --> 30:35.590]  A lot of vMix.
[30:35.850 --> 30:38.850]  If if what you're talking about is a doable thing, Gavin, then yeah, let's just,
[30:38.990 --> 30:39.770]  you know, then we can do it.
[30:39.810 --> 30:41.650]  I just did. I don't know that that's doable.
[30:41.990 --> 30:44.670]  Like, I'm going to throw something out out of my eyes, too.
[30:44.770 --> 30:48.050]  I have no idea how any of this works, so I'm just I'm just throwing it out.
[30:48.690 --> 30:49.330]  Complete ignorance.
[30:50.410 --> 30:54.790]  If we all shared our gameplay to Discord
[30:55.390 --> 30:58.550]  and there were sources for it in the same way that I did with Mafia,
[30:59.370 --> 31:02.770]  would there be a way to just easily toggle between like the sources
[31:02.770 --> 31:04.410]  and OBS of whose videos playing?
[31:05.330 --> 31:08.290]  You'd have to manually switch it in Discord, I think.
[31:08.410 --> 31:12.290]  Yeah. And we're looking at a lower resolution for five
[31:12.290 --> 31:15.050]  instead of a lower resolution, likely for one. Sure.
[31:15.410 --> 31:19.150]  OK, so whenever we try to do that, all of our audio is all on top of everything.
[31:19.350 --> 31:20.230]  That's true, too.
[31:20.370 --> 31:24.610]  Yeah. The upside to the vMix thing is we can still all do our own individual audio
[31:24.610 --> 31:27.930]  and then we'd also be able to all five of us
[31:27.930 --> 31:30.690]  would be able to stream our video.
[31:30.950 --> 31:34.710]  And then we just have a sync point for it so that we're all in sync.
[31:36.510 --> 31:39.850]  So it'd just be a matter of figuring out how to set that up on that computer.
[31:40.190 --> 31:41.910]  Yeah, we can talk to we can talk to a couple of people
[31:41.910 --> 31:43.430]  we used to work with and see if it's something we can do.
[31:43.970 --> 31:47.270]  That is just so everyone listening to this is aware of that is
[31:47.950 --> 31:51.230]  just outside of our wheelhouse of what of what we know how to do.
[31:51.330 --> 31:55.010]  So maybe we do the numbers as the first one and then Call of Duty after that.
[31:55.550 --> 31:55.910]  Sure.
[31:57.490 --> 32:00.490]  Can I can I just on the record just thumbs down the numbers thing?
[32:01.190 --> 32:02.390]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[32:02.570 --> 32:05.150]  I've I've also given a thumbs down to the numbers thing.
[32:05.410 --> 32:06.750]  Oh, I'm a thumbs up.
[32:06.750 --> 32:07.330]  So that's two.
[32:08.050 --> 32:09.490]  And everyone else is thumbs thumbs up?
[32:09.950 --> 32:11.830]  Yeah, I think we're all thumbs up. OK.
[32:12.070 --> 32:12.570]  Yeah, why not?
[32:13.710 --> 32:14.770]  OK, there you go.
[32:15.430 --> 32:17.250]  I mean, Gavin, I'm with you. Absolutely. Thumbs down.
[32:17.430 --> 32:20.450]  I put it in the I put it in the chat as soon as he started talking.
[32:20.530 --> 32:23.450]  You said you liked it as soon as I introduced the live stream element.
[32:23.450 --> 32:27.030]  Yeah, it makes me on board with it and makes it worth our time.
[32:27.330 --> 32:29.250]  Probably, but I guess that sounds like that.
[32:29.430 --> 32:31.590]  That sounds like, oh, that's definitely not a thumbs up towards.
[32:31.690 --> 32:34.710]  No, if you were to ask me thumbs up, thumbs down on it, I'd still be thumbs down.
[32:35.250 --> 32:37.750]  Wow. If Eric's thumbs down, I'm thumbs up.
[32:38.030 --> 32:39.530]  There you go. There we go.
[32:39.570 --> 32:40.370]  Got four against one.
[32:40.890 --> 32:42.630]  All right. What's what's the next one, Geoff?
[32:42.970 --> 32:46.310]  Next one I have written down is this would be require us
[32:46.310 --> 32:48.730]  all to be in the same room or at least have webcams.
[32:48.790 --> 32:50.530]  This is the I spy draft.
[32:54.340 --> 32:55.340]  I can't remember.
[32:56.240 --> 32:59.660]  I can't remember whose idea that was, but I don't think it was mine.
[33:01.240 --> 33:04.860]  I mean, Kevin, give it a thumbs up.
[33:04.940 --> 33:07.780]  I spy with my little eye something red.
[33:09.380 --> 33:13.240]  I spy. I mean, this is just the same idea as the numbers thing, essentially.
[33:13.460 --> 33:14.400]  Right. I think it was.
[33:14.440 --> 33:16.240]  I think it was built off of the idea.
[33:16.420 --> 33:17.440]  I think I think it probably was.
[33:17.660 --> 33:19.800]  I think I think we just said that's a terrible idea.
[33:19.980 --> 33:21.160]  I spy was pitched. Yeah.
[33:21.160 --> 33:23.200]  Except I think I think it was.
[33:23.740 --> 33:24.760]  Yeah, the idea is bad.
[33:24.800 --> 33:25.600]  The idea is bad.
[33:25.620 --> 33:27.860]  And then somebody else went, yeah, you think that's a bad idea?
[33:27.940 --> 33:28.680]  Check this one out.
[33:28.720 --> 33:31.480]  And I think that's just sort of how it might have been Meg's idea.
[33:31.580 --> 33:33.280]  But I'm not 100% sure.
[33:34.400 --> 33:36.520]  I don't know if we'd be comfortable with this.
[33:39.180 --> 33:41.220]  But maybe it's an office.
[33:42.080 --> 33:44.120]  Maybe it's a camp like an in-office cam
[33:44.700 --> 33:47.120]  is the perspective that you're pulling the I spy from.
[33:47.600 --> 33:49.020]  And maybe it's a stream.
[33:49.020 --> 33:52.960]  And maybe it's the audience that has to figure out what we're spying.
[33:53.260 --> 33:54.720]  Maybe they're the ones making guesses.
[33:55.000 --> 33:58.620]  You're just going to see you're going to see words fly on the screen
[33:58.620 --> 34:00.100]  like you've never seen before.
[34:00.160 --> 34:01.980]  Oh, I love it. That's let's put a pin.
[34:02.020 --> 34:06.180]  I don't know if there is a way to do it, but there might be a way to like
[34:06.180 --> 34:09.900]  in Twitch have a certain word be like toggleable.
[34:09.980 --> 34:12.840]  So if somebody puts it in, it like highlights.
[34:13.380 --> 34:15.860]  Like instead of a banned word, it's like the word.
[34:16.400 --> 34:20.100]  Yeah, or maybe we make the word banned or I don't know.
[34:20.280 --> 34:22.700]  There's probably something you can do in the back end to make it so
[34:22.700 --> 34:26.720]  like it is a noticeable event if somebody types in.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.860]  So correct by item.
[34:28.940 --> 34:31.040]  So it's us at the office.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.320]  Yes. With a with a camera that is like wide
[34:35.320 --> 34:40.360]  showing like the whole space and then say, Gavin goes, OK,
[34:40.380 --> 34:43.940]  I spy with my little eyes, something that's green.
[34:43.940 --> 34:49.560]  And then. We're all giving the chat time to guess
[34:49.560 --> 34:52.080]  at whatever could be in that room that they can see that screen
[34:52.620 --> 34:54.360]  and then they're helping us guess.
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.380]  Is that how you play it with colors?
[34:56.920 --> 34:59.480]  All right. I mean, yeah, I think so.
[34:59.540 --> 35:01.260]  Is that how you play? Typically, it's colors.
[35:01.940 --> 35:04.560]  Oh, it could be colors.
[35:04.700 --> 35:08.660]  You could be like something small or, you know, I've just never.
[35:09.540 --> 35:12.720]  I've only ever played something beginning with the letter.
[35:13.220 --> 35:18.160]  Oh, I mean, these are all these are all valid values that you could do it.
[35:18.820 --> 35:20.780]  Just not what I think of when I think of I spy.
[35:21.140 --> 35:23.700]  Well, like something round or something.
[35:23.940 --> 35:27.340]  Yeah. So we usually start with color in my family, though.
[35:27.720 --> 35:29.220]  So we want to try I spy.
[35:29.560 --> 35:33.260]  Let's investigate I spy with the with the community,
[35:33.320 --> 35:34.560]  like with the Falcons or something.
[35:35.040 --> 35:38.760]  Office video. What if we did?
[35:42.060 --> 35:48.360]  Instead of Twitch plays Pokemon, it could be Twitch controls Andrew and we play hide and seek.
[35:50.320 --> 35:54.200]  If that's a doable thing, I think it's I don't know how that would work with the Dilbot.
[35:54.740 --> 35:56.960]  You just have to reach out and go where they want.
[35:57.700 --> 36:01.380]  Oh, OK. I thought you might give them controls of Dilbot.
[36:01.560 --> 36:02.500]  That's totally fine.
[36:02.520 --> 36:04.960]  That sounds way too hard for us to figure out.
[36:05.060 --> 36:07.140]  Yeah, absolutely. That's why it's like, I don't know, chat.
[36:07.640 --> 36:10.100]  And we're hidden in different places around the office.
[36:10.500 --> 36:12.440]  OK, I think that's a fun thing.
[36:13.040 --> 36:18.580]  Circling back on the I spy idea, maybe it's something where if they figure out
[36:18.580 --> 36:23.000]  like they have an hour to figure out all of our stuff and if they get it right,
[36:23.080 --> 36:26.180]  then we have to stay there for like seven hours or eight or whatever the time is.
[36:27.080 --> 36:28.300]  Maybe it's like a win lose.
[36:29.080 --> 36:32.800]  Like they are if they get all of the things like we all pick an item
[36:32.800 --> 36:35.720]  that is within the frame of the thing. Right.
[36:35.720 --> 36:36.800]  So we all have our thing.
[36:37.280 --> 36:40.320]  If they get all of ours, then we're stuck there
[36:40.320 --> 36:43.100]  for the remainder of that that work shift or whatever.
[36:44.020 --> 36:45.900]  And when we get in that endurance, I don't know.
[36:46.240 --> 36:48.480]  We're just stuck. We're stuck there.
[36:49.920 --> 36:52.620]  If we if they fail, it gives them a win lose scenario.
[36:53.100 --> 36:56.400]  If they fail at finding or five things, then the stream's over in an hour.
[36:56.860 --> 36:58.320]  I mean, I like the idea of some high stakes.
[36:58.860 --> 36:59.780]  Just throwing it out there.
[36:59.820 --> 37:01.500]  I mean, we could thumbs down on that idea.
[37:01.580 --> 37:02.360]  That's the point of this.
[37:02.440 --> 37:03.940]  I'm just trying to think of stakes.
[37:04.280 --> 37:06.740]  I think there's some something here.
[37:06.960 --> 37:09.180]  I think we just maybe need to cook on it a little bit longer.
[37:09.520 --> 37:12.460]  What if they win? We have to spin the wheel of ****.
[37:13.740 --> 37:14.800]  What's the wheel of ****?
[37:15.460 --> 37:18.380]  That was like the tough video game tasks.
[37:18.680 --> 37:19.840]  That's how that's why I'm playing Limbo.
[37:20.640 --> 37:21.280]  Oh, right.
[37:21.560 --> 37:22.460]  You should probably do that.
[37:22.480 --> 37:23.780]  I think you should probably beat Limbo first.
[37:24.300 --> 37:25.140]  Yeah. When are you going to do that?
[37:25.220 --> 37:28.180]  Yeah, I think if they find all of our stuff, you have to start playing Limbo.
[37:28.880 --> 37:31.180]  Every time I bring up the wheel of ****.
[37:31.640 --> 37:34.360]  Yeah, I just don't know why you keep doing it.
[37:34.580 --> 37:36.500]  Well, you could just be quiet.
[37:37.380 --> 37:40.820]  You just need to beat Limbo and then you can bring it up in it.
[37:41.220 --> 37:45.400]  Andrew's wheel of **** looks suspiciously like a boomerang.
[37:49.700 --> 37:51.980]  Do you want me to yellow light that one then?
[37:52.160 --> 37:53.180]  Yeah, yellow light it.
[37:53.340 --> 37:54.760]  Got it. It's piss light.
[37:55.160 --> 37:56.300]  Yeah. What about chatbot?
[37:57.020 --> 37:57.960]  Chatbot. Jesus Christ.
[37:58.060 --> 38:00.060]  Chat controls hide and seek Dilbot.
[38:00.060 --> 38:01.260]  I think that's fun.
[38:01.480 --> 38:03.820]  I think that could be like a supplemental type video.
[38:03.920 --> 38:04.740]  Yeah, we agree on that.
[38:05.160 --> 38:06.880]  OK, green light. OK, got it.
[38:06.960 --> 38:09.860]  Moving on to the next because we still got to get through these **** things.
[38:09.980 --> 38:11.400]  And we're oh my God, we're already 30 minutes in.
[38:13.040 --> 38:13.900]  This one. All right.
[38:13.920 --> 38:15.900]  This one was a little convoluted.
[38:16.220 --> 38:18.600]  There's 50 slots in this one. OK.
[38:19.260 --> 38:22.260]  We each maintain control of 10 slots.
[38:22.820 --> 38:25.040]  It's a big mega food draft.
[38:25.480 --> 38:30.040]  We then everybody drafts 10 meals into those 50 slots.
[38:30.040 --> 38:33.180]  Those 50 slots correspond to 50 Sundays
[38:33.720 --> 38:37.340]  throughout the year with Christmas and Thanksgiving off.
[38:37.400 --> 38:41.100]  And then we all have to eat that food on that Sunday for an entire year.
[38:43.080 --> 38:45.120]  I can I...
[38:45.120 --> 38:46.300]  Sunday Supper Club.
[38:46.580 --> 38:50.200]  I mean, I love the idea so much.
[38:50.380 --> 38:51.920]  I had a similar type thing.
[38:51.980 --> 38:54.680]  And I don't know if you guys will be able to solve the problem
[38:54.680 --> 38:59.240]  I had with this premise of I wanted to do a thing before
[38:59.240 --> 39:04.220]  where everybody would submit a bunch of foods that they like
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.880]  into something that could automated message us.
[39:08.160 --> 39:11.660]  But we have no idea when it will message or what it will message.
[39:11.820 --> 39:14.340]  It just has a list of foods that it can pull from.
[39:15.060 --> 39:18.160]  And if you whenever it goes out, you have to get that food that day,
[39:18.240 --> 39:19.660]  no matter what's going on.
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.040]  So it could in the middle of a Wednesday at 11 a.m., it could just say eggs.
[39:24.540 --> 39:26.180]  Yes. And then you have to go get eggs.
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.580]  That day, you have to eat an egg dish that day.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.020]  I think that's a great idea on its own.
[39:33.420 --> 39:36.740]  But if we were to combine these ideas, I would think it would be
[39:36.740 --> 39:40.080]  we pick the 50 meals, it goes into a random thing.
[39:40.520 --> 39:44.340]  We hit the button every Monday and it tells us what we're all going to have
[39:44.340 --> 39:45.160]  to eat on Sunday.
[39:45.300 --> 39:47.580]  And so we can't know more than a week in advance.
[39:48.140 --> 39:50.060]  So we have a week to get in all the ingredients.
[39:50.540 --> 39:51.960]  Yeah. And figure out how we're going to.
[39:52.080 --> 39:55.280]  Yeah. Or like figure out where to figure out where to go to eat it. Yeah.
[39:56.180 --> 39:58.060]  A year is a shitload of time.
[39:58.240 --> 40:00.800]  It's a shitload of time. It lasts forever.
[40:00.980 --> 40:03.740]  It also forces I think it gets funny when you're on vacation
[40:04.440 --> 40:07.540]  and you're like, how the fuck do I find a beef Wellington in Thailand?
[40:07.820 --> 40:09.380]  I don't know.
[40:10.780 --> 40:14.600]  Maybe could we could we do a trial run where it's like
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.560]  we do like Food February or something, and it's every Sunday of February.
[40:19.980 --> 40:22.680]  How about Eat-tober? Eat-tober is good.
[40:23.900 --> 40:25.060]  I like Eat-tober.
[40:25.380 --> 40:28.780]  So for the month of October, we we throw
[40:28.780 --> 40:33.060]  everybody puts one into the random number or the random food generator.
[40:33.180 --> 40:35.500]  We'll have five. So one won't get used probably.
[40:35.680 --> 40:36.680]  And then we'll spit them out.
[40:36.960 --> 40:39.460]  Are there four Sundays in October? I'm assuming.
[40:39.620 --> 40:41.620]  What's the next month with five Sundays?
[40:42.480 --> 40:49.080]  Well, I think we could do a four Sunday month,
[40:49.220 --> 40:51.960]  but then spin the wheel and see who gets fucked
[40:51.960 --> 40:53.220]  and doesn't get to pick a meal.
[40:54.320 --> 40:56.860]  November's the next. Or we could do November's the next five Sunday.
[40:57.340 --> 41:00.700]  I do think it's funny if one of us doesn't have any say in their Sunday meal
[41:01.300 --> 41:02.240]  for a whole month.
[41:02.940 --> 41:03.880]  I think that's great.
[41:04.420 --> 41:05.960]  I mean, November's coming up there.
[41:06.300 --> 41:08.480]  Yeah, November's tough, though, because it's also the holiday.
[41:09.020 --> 41:11.180]  So you're going to be dealing with like Thanksgiving dinner and stuff.
[41:11.340 --> 41:13.940]  I think I think Food-tober is the way in just one of us.
[41:14.420 --> 41:19.720]  We spin a wheel and whoever it lands on doesn't get to make a pick for that month.
[41:19.760 --> 41:20.560]  I think you're right about that.
[41:21.140 --> 41:23.960]  Yeah. Eat-tober. Let's do it.
[41:24.040 --> 41:26.440]  Eat-tober. OK, what am I writing down?
[41:28.060 --> 41:31.100]  You went in like I get the concept.
[41:31.640 --> 41:34.540]  I'm making everyone restate what the concept is.
[41:34.540 --> 41:37.540]  So that way we're all on the same page and I'm writing the thing down
[41:37.540 --> 41:38.780]  that we can refer back to.
[41:39.260 --> 41:41.220]  So you just want us to restate the concept to you?
[41:41.720 --> 41:42.960]  Correct. So I can write it down.
[41:42.960 --> 41:45.360]  So that way when we go, what the fuck was Eat-tober?
[41:45.840 --> 41:47.240]  I'm on top of it. OK, all right.
[41:47.240 --> 41:50.680]  So at some point in the month of August or September,
[41:51.360 --> 41:54.980]  we are going to have a supplemental video
[41:54.980 --> 41:58.080]  where we sit down and we each submit a meal.
[41:58.600 --> 42:01.080]  The five of us submit a Sunday meal.
[42:01.480 --> 42:02.860]  One, two, three, four, five.
[42:02.980 --> 42:04.900]  It's a one round draft or one round supplemental.
[42:05.280 --> 42:09.600]  Then we determine via wheel one of us sitting out
[42:09.600 --> 42:13.760]  or we just pull we spend them all on the wheel and whichever one
[42:13.760 --> 42:15.720]  we pull them off as they get selected.
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.780]  And then we build out the October Sunday meal list.
[42:20.700 --> 42:22.700]  And then we adhere to it.
[42:23.040 --> 42:24.580]  Love it, right? Yeah.
[42:24.720 --> 42:27.140]  Yep. Perfect. Perfect.
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.680]  Eat-tober. At some point in August or September,
[42:31.680 --> 42:35.500]  we're going to have a supplemental video where we all submit a Sunday meal.
[42:35.620 --> 42:38.600]  We determine via the wheel that someone sits out.
[42:38.760 --> 42:41.160]  We adhere to the Sunday October meal list.
[42:41.900 --> 42:43.040]  Yes. Yeah.
[42:43.080 --> 42:45.380]  What meal of the day is it or can it be any?
[42:46.020 --> 42:47.220]  I think it can be any.
[42:47.860 --> 42:49.600]  Yeah, I like that.
[42:50.400 --> 42:53.740]  I already have my meal, which means I'm not going to be able to pick one.
[42:56.240 --> 42:57.600]  That's how the universe works.
[42:57.780 --> 43:01.840]  OK, eat-tober as a trial run, at least, is on the board.
[43:02.260 --> 43:03.500]  So we got it. OK.
[43:04.620 --> 43:05.460]  Well, moving on.
[43:06.040 --> 43:07.580]  Oh, this one is already on the books.
[43:07.640 --> 43:10.480]  It's the top 20 and the order of the draft is the ranking.
[43:10.480 --> 43:12.900]  We're recording this on Friday.
[43:13.220 --> 43:16.960]  Yeah, I was going to say when when this comes out, we'll actually be recording that.
[43:17.320 --> 43:19.260]  We're probably recording it now if you listen to this.
[43:19.720 --> 43:21.860]  Yeah. Unless you're listening to it later, then we already did it.
[43:22.000 --> 43:22.440]  How'd we do?
[43:24.160 --> 43:25.260]  Do you want to explain it, Geoff?
[43:26.100 --> 43:30.980]  Yeah. So the idea is it's a draft with 20 slots like our normal drafts have.
[43:31.120 --> 43:31.820]  Snake draft style.
[43:32.200 --> 43:34.840]  We each get to pick five items or four items.
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.480]  I'm sorry. And no, is it five items?
[43:38.740 --> 43:39.560]  How many items do we pick?
[43:39.560 --> 43:41.760]  Four. Four. Yeah, we each pick four items.
[43:41.900 --> 43:46.720]  Sorry. And what we're picking for, we're populating the 20 greatest
[43:46.720 --> 43:49.400]  video games of all time, numbered one to 20.
[43:49.540 --> 43:51.800]  Number one being the greatest video game of all time.
[43:51.880 --> 43:55.340]  Number 20 being the 20th greatest video game of all time.
[43:55.440 --> 43:59.860]  However, where you end up randomly in the draft determines
[43:59.860 --> 44:01.840]  where on that list you pick.
[44:01.940 --> 44:05.020]  So if I end up picking third on the draft list,
[44:05.280 --> 44:08.340]  I am drafting the third best video game of all time.
[44:08.340 --> 44:10.360]  There is no discussion or debate.
[44:10.480 --> 44:11.640]  It is my slot to fill.
[44:11.920 --> 44:15.000]  So you might disagree vehemently with me putting Viva Pinata
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.580]  Trouble in Paradise as the third best video game of all time.
[44:17.660 --> 44:19.780]  But it doesn't fucking matter because it's my slot.
[44:20.100 --> 44:23.820]  And through that process, we will determine the 20 best video games
[44:23.820 --> 44:28.180]  of all time ranked in an order that will make zero people on the planet Earth happy.
[44:28.700 --> 44:30.800]  So so you're not going to be considerate of the list.
[44:30.860 --> 44:32.720]  You're just going to put whatever you feel like in your slot.
[44:32.880 --> 44:35.340]  I'm going to be honest to my to the truth of me,
[44:35.340 --> 44:40.160]  because I really like Halo one, but I couldn't put that as number one.
[44:40.600 --> 44:42.160]  Well, then don't.
[44:42.400 --> 44:42.720]  Well, I know.
[44:42.940 --> 44:46.380]  Actually, I had in the process of this list, I had this thought
[44:46.960 --> 44:50.120]  and I came to the conclusion that if you were going to play
[44:50.120 --> 44:53.320]  any Halo game right now, Halo Infinite's the best Halo game.
[44:53.400 --> 44:56.700]  I think if you're deeming what the best one is, it's Halo Infinite.
[44:57.360 --> 45:01.240]  But most people would not say because you factoring in impact and.
[45:02.320 --> 45:03.580]  The time in which was released.
[45:03.580 --> 45:07.420]  But if you're evaluating it purely on what is the most entertaining
[45:07.420 --> 45:10.260]  Halo game to play right now, it is infinite.
[45:10.640 --> 45:13.860]  And if that's your best video game of all time, Gavin, go ahead
[45:13.860 --> 45:17.100]  and put Halo Infinite as number one if that's the slot you pull.
[45:17.720 --> 45:20.720]  But would you rather play infinite than Halo three?
[45:21.200 --> 45:23.460]  Yes. Halo three is so slow.
[45:24.100 --> 45:26.540]  I didn't feel that way at the time Halo three came out.
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.760]  But to go back to Halo three now, it is such a sluggish game.
[45:31.300 --> 45:32.300]  Oh, I don't think it's that bad.
[45:32.300 --> 45:33.660]  Oh, it's so bad.
[45:35.400 --> 45:38.820]  In my opinion, obviously, I'm not, you know, I'm glad you like it.
[45:39.000 --> 45:43.320]  And these are the kind of disagreements you can expect when you watch
[45:43.320 --> 45:47.620]  the 20 greatest video games of all time as ranked draft.
[45:47.780 --> 45:49.760]  It's going to be phenomenal. I can't wait.
[45:50.260 --> 45:50.820]  I can't wait.
[45:51.140 --> 45:55.180]  I already have thoughts of other content that can jump off of that,
[45:55.300 --> 45:57.060]  which I'm excited to see play out.
[45:57.420 --> 46:00.260]  Yeah, the format works for anything that you can rank.
[46:00.820 --> 46:03.920]  Yeah, I meant like even outside of that format,
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.020]  that there are content ideas that could spring from this.
[46:07.340 --> 46:09.480]  Oh, yeah, the format works even outside of the format.
[46:09.560 --> 46:10.100]  It's the best.
[46:11.220 --> 46:14.120]  I have an idea of a game that Gavin might pick,
[46:14.220 --> 46:17.540]  and I don't think I've ever played that game.
[46:17.600 --> 46:20.000]  So it could be a thing of like, I think you're crazy.
[46:20.660 --> 46:21.740]  Let's play this game.
[46:21.940 --> 46:23.380]  Is it Oddworld Gabe's Odyssey?
[46:23.960 --> 46:28.960]  It is odd... Gabe's Odyssey... Gabe's Odyssey...
[46:31.380 --> 46:34.380]  I would bet that Gavin would put that in his top 20.
[46:37.220 --> 46:38.440]  Oh, I'm right there with you, buddy.
[46:38.500 --> 46:41.860]  That's why I knew instantly what game it was the second you said it.
[46:42.060 --> 46:45.180]  Oh, there's Gabe, there's the Gliggs, there's Glullock the Glucken.
[46:45.560 --> 46:49.020]  That is not what I was thinking, but you're totally right.
[46:49.180 --> 46:50.960]  And it still applies.
[46:51.160 --> 46:52.200]  I never played any of those games.
[46:53.360 --> 46:55.220]  Oh, I love, I love Abe.
[46:58.600 --> 46:59.400]  Oh, Christ.
[46:59.400 --> 47:00.480]  That's going to be fun.
[47:00.840 --> 47:01.840]  I'm so excited to do more.
[47:01.940 --> 47:04.540]  I've already made a list of movies, TV shows and games.
[47:04.860 --> 47:06.160]  I'm very excited about the idea.
[47:06.760 --> 47:11.320]  I only have one more on my list, but I'd like to hear if Eric has any others
[47:11.320 --> 47:13.440]  because I know we were keeping independent lists that day
[47:13.440 --> 47:15.140]  and I feel like I might have forgotten one or two.
[47:15.760 --> 47:18.080]  So he might be able to fill in if I did forget something.
[47:18.220 --> 47:23.460]  But the last thing on my list from that day is the song is a location draft,
[47:23.600 --> 47:25.500]  which I don't think the name does it justice.
[47:25.500 --> 47:31.240]  Basically, it is a draft of songs where the title of the song is a location
[47:31.240 --> 47:34.680]  like Detroit, Rock City or Galveston.
[47:35.280 --> 47:36.820]  Oh, it has to be in the title, not in the lyrics.
[47:37.300 --> 47:38.460]  In the title, yeah. In the title.
[47:38.760 --> 47:41.300]  Oh, shit. Yeah, I think it's a great one.
[47:41.940 --> 47:42.800]  New York, New York.
[47:42.920 --> 47:45.500]  I left my heart in San Francisco, et cetera, et cetera.
[47:46.320 --> 47:48.820]  Garden Grove by Sublime. Yeah.
[47:49.520 --> 47:51.080]  I got my number one pick already.
[47:51.400 --> 47:52.100]  I'm locked in. Wow.
[47:53.460 --> 47:54.540]  I think it's a fun draft.
[47:54.540 --> 47:56.580]  I think that's an easy one. No brainer.
[47:56.620 --> 47:58.240]  It's an easy yep. Yeah.
[47:59.340 --> 48:00.840]  Eric, was there anything else from that day?
[48:01.420 --> 48:05.520]  Looking at some of the other stuff that we've left on the board
[48:06.120 --> 48:10.860]  that we talked about, but haven't gotten circled back around to here.
[48:11.360 --> 48:12.840]  Gavin's 2025 threat.
[48:15.620 --> 48:16.600]  Hahahahaha! My what?
[48:17.980 --> 48:20.480]  This is why I ask you guys to repeat the description sometimes.
[48:21.400 --> 48:23.060]  He... you made a threat.
[48:23.060 --> 48:26.420]  I don't remember what caused it, but you're like,
[48:26.960 --> 48:33.760]  uh, this is a threat. Something's gonna happen. And, uh, that was it.
[48:33.840 --> 48:35.660]  I vaguely remember that, yeah.
[48:36.240 --> 48:40.720]  You dropped the threat down, and then we're like, well, what are you gonna do? And you're like,
[48:40.820 --> 48:44.760]  well, I don't know. And it was very clear that you didn't know what you were gonna do.
[48:44.820 --> 48:45.700]  You just said it.
[48:45.780 --> 48:47.300]  So I never announced the threat.
[48:47.820 --> 48:51.860]  No, no, you announced that there was a threat. I think it was towards Nick.
[48:51.860 --> 48:55.400]  I feel like it was a threat towards Nick, but I don't remember clearly.
[48:55.660 --> 48:58.760]  But I do remember I went like, am I putting this on, like, in, like,
[48:58.800 --> 49:00.660]  the Idea Bank? And I think Geoff said yes.
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.360]  Uh, it was towards everyone except me initially. And then he added me.
[49:05.460 --> 49:08.000]  Okay. I feel like everyone remembers this better than I do.
[49:08.460 --> 49:10.440]  You better go back and listen to some old podcasts.
[49:10.940 --> 49:12.460]  And it was on the podcast?
[49:12.880 --> 49:14.060]  I don't think it was on a podcast.
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.300]  It was, no, I think it was like the end of an episode.
[49:16.580 --> 49:19.200]  You've got a score to settle with this. You just gotta figure out what it is.
[49:19.200 --> 49:22.120]  It was, I don't think, I think it was a between recording thing.
[49:22.180 --> 49:25.820]  And I think it was you, you just like, it was so unlike you.
[49:25.900 --> 49:30.100]  You're like, mm, get ready for a threat. Something's gonna happen.
[49:30.580 --> 49:33.780]  Oh man, I wish I remembered that. Shit, that sounds good.
[49:34.240 --> 49:37.200]  Yeah. So, so that's one idea.
[49:37.460 --> 49:40.080]  Another one that we had that we haven't gotten back around to.
[49:40.140 --> 49:42.740]  And it's something that I wonder if it's, we want to talk about here.
[49:43.420 --> 49:44.840]  If not, cut this out, whatever.
[49:45.720 --> 49:48.320]  3D Ultra Mini Golf Marathon Stream.
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.640]  We talked about doing some streaming stuff.
[49:51.980 --> 49:54.560]  Trying to figure out like what else we can do on Twitch.
[49:54.860 --> 49:57.900]  And we've had a lot of conversations about like where it can live
[49:57.900 --> 49:58.920]  and what we can do and whatever.
[49:59.140 --> 50:02.860]  And something that was brought up was a 3D Ultra Mini Golf Marathon Stream
[50:02.860 --> 50:06.360]  where like one hole is however many subs or something like that.
[50:06.460 --> 50:08.460]  So I wonder if that's something that we still want to explore.
[50:08.520 --> 50:10.180]  It doesn't have to be now that we have to explore it.
[50:10.780 --> 50:12.400]  But something that we should, we can talk about
[50:12.400 --> 50:15.480]  if that's something we want to explore in streaming in general.
[50:16.180 --> 50:16.420]  Yeah.
[50:17.180 --> 50:18.300]  I think that's fun.
[50:19.080 --> 50:21.360]  I think that would be a great like yearly event type thing.
[50:21.480 --> 50:24.080]  Like how there is like the PGA Open or whatever.
[50:24.280 --> 50:25.060]  Like they're specific.
[50:25.460 --> 50:27.760]  Doing like a yearly golf tournament I think is fun.
[50:28.160 --> 50:32.740]  Have you ever played in your childhood like during summer break or anything?
[50:32.840 --> 50:36.360]  Did you ever play like Rummy 500 with your friends or like I don't know,
[50:36.400 --> 50:42.320]  a sibling or Rummy 1000 where you would keep score over a series of
[50:43.380 --> 50:47.660]  maybe 20 hands of Rummy and it could take days, but you'd keep coming back to it?
[50:48.140 --> 50:48.260]  No.
[50:48.920 --> 50:51.160]  I used to do that when I was a kid a lot.
[50:51.240 --> 50:51.920]  I played a lot of Rummy.
[50:52.220 --> 50:53.780]  And so we'd play like Rummy 1000.
[50:54.040 --> 50:55.840]  And you know, you get like 60 points in a round,
[50:55.940 --> 50:57.620]  but you'd keep the score and you'd always come back.
[50:57.680 --> 50:58.680]  And it'd be like, where are we at today?
[50:58.740 --> 51:00.600]  And it'd be like, it's 350 to 268.
[51:00.700 --> 51:02.300]  And you'd be like, oh, I'll get the 500 for you.
[51:02.680 --> 51:06.200]  But you know, one game of Rummy could last like two weeks through your summer.
[51:06.760 --> 51:07.820]  Like if I was hanging out.
[51:08.140 --> 51:10.760]  What if we do golf forever
[51:10.760 --> 51:17.080]  and we just have to permanently keep the score of our golf haulage across all games forever?
[51:17.300 --> 51:19.560]  Yeah, I think that's what Geoff's driving at.
[51:19.720 --> 51:20.940]  I do like that idea.
[51:21.460 --> 51:26.000]  100% what I'm driving at is what if there's a master golf score that we're keeping up with
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.600]  that matters and that we track somewhere.
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.800]  And anytime we play Golf It, Golf with Friends, 3D Ultra Mini Golf, whatever,
[51:34.840 --> 51:37.980]  that it gets entered into the overall master score.
[51:38.360 --> 51:38.840]  I like it.
[51:38.880 --> 51:39.220]  Love it.
[51:39.740 --> 51:42.780]  Like call it like Mini Golf Major, like something like that.
[51:43.240 --> 51:44.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51:44.960 --> 51:45.860]  That's a great idea.
[51:46.500 --> 51:50.360]  Is it a thing where like it's a grand tour idea and we have to compile
[51:50.360 --> 51:53.140]  all the golf games ahead of time and we make sure we hit all of them?
[51:53.500 --> 51:55.480]  And then maybe there's like a...
[51:58.060 --> 52:01.880]  the Masters, I guess, at the end of the year that we compete in.
[52:02.040 --> 52:02.320]  I like that a lot.
[52:02.320 --> 52:03.520]  For the green jacket or whatever.
[52:03.600 --> 52:06.780]  I just want to make sure we hit because I don't think we have a natural enough golf cadence
[52:06.780 --> 52:07.440]  necessarily.
[52:07.880 --> 52:08.820]  Yeah, no, not at all.
[52:08.820 --> 52:09.900]  The scale that I'd want.
[52:09.960 --> 52:13.420]  So I think we should probably compile a bunch of golf games we could play.
[52:13.540 --> 52:14.980]  I'm looking up right now in the store.
[52:15.400 --> 52:19.760]  I know they just released a collection of all the Golden Tee games.
[52:20.300 --> 52:20.840]  I wonder if those have...
[52:20.840 --> 52:21.440]  I did see that.
[52:21.540 --> 52:22.140]  I did see that.
[52:22.320 --> 52:22.460]  Online.
[52:22.460 --> 52:23.380]  Going to a bar?
[52:23.540 --> 52:24.360]  Jesus Christ.
[52:24.640 --> 52:25.220]  No, on Xbox.
[52:25.700 --> 52:27.120]  You can play Golden Tee on Xbox now.
[52:27.120 --> 52:27.920]  It's like eight.
[52:28.460 --> 52:33.220]  Well, they put together like eight Golden Tee games, including like the bowling one they did.
[52:34.420 --> 52:36.120]  Golden Tee Arcade Classics.
[52:36.200 --> 52:37.600]  Does this have online multiplayer?
[52:38.220 --> 52:38.940]  That's crazy.
[52:39.240 --> 52:40.980]  I guess what he does isn't even need to be online.
[52:41.060 --> 52:42.320]  We could just all play simultaneously.
[52:43.240 --> 52:43.600]  Theoretically.
[52:44.740 --> 52:45.840]  Yeah, it's just local.
[52:45.860 --> 52:46.920]  It's local multiplayer.
[52:47.080 --> 52:48.220]  So you guys could play two to four.
[52:49.020 --> 52:49.720]  That's crazy.
[52:50.120 --> 52:53.900]  Should we do it where once a year we look at the who's the top and who's the bottom and
[52:53.900 --> 52:58.580]  there's like a prize for the winner and a penalty for the loser?
[52:58.840 --> 53:00.460]  Yeah, green jacket for the winner for sure.
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.920]  And then the loser...
[53:01.920 --> 53:02.500]  Boots for the loser.
[53:04.580 --> 53:07.420]  Maybe we have to all get maybe we just go get lunch at a golf course.
[53:08.700 --> 53:10.400]  Green jacket, red boots.
[53:14.300 --> 53:15.740]  Um, maybe is it...
[53:16.940 --> 53:21.020]  We could do a Golden Tee tournament because there's enough games and whoever wins gets
[53:21.020 --> 53:21.660]  a Golden Tee.
[53:22.120 --> 53:23.440]  Maybe it can be a face off thing.
[53:23.880 --> 53:29.860]  And Joel Golden Tee 3D Golf, Golden Tee 97, Golden Tee 98, Golden Tee 99, Golden Tee 2K
[53:29.860 --> 53:31.640]  and Golden Tee Classic.
[53:32.320 --> 53:32.540]  Wow.
[53:33.300 --> 53:33.680]  Wow.
[53:33.860 --> 53:35.520]  In addition to all the other golf games on Earth.
[53:35.520 --> 53:38.920]  I do think there's something here to us doing a golf tournament.
[53:39.180 --> 53:42.020]  I love the idea of green jacket, red boots.
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.740]  I love the idea of a master golf score.
[53:44.920 --> 53:47.540]  I love the idea of it all working together towards some greater goal.
[53:47.620 --> 53:48.920]  I think that we can...
[53:48.920 --> 53:52.020]  This is another one that we can put a little bit of time crafting and I think it could
[53:52.020 --> 53:53.020]  be something really big.
[53:53.600 --> 53:59.500]  And I like these overarching ideas that last for a year or more potentially.
[53:59.900 --> 54:03.200]  And so I think that we should really put some time into making sure that this would get
[54:03.200 --> 54:03.840]  in the most out of this.
[54:03.900 --> 54:05.140]  This is a fucking great idea.
[54:05.520 --> 54:10.580]  I really like the idea of eventually having a website where people can just check the
[54:10.580 --> 54:12.060]  current stats on something.
[54:12.580 --> 54:12.740]  Yeah.
[54:13.060 --> 54:18.300]  And that'd be a great one for it, along with hamburgers and other stuff that we got going.
[54:20.800 --> 54:22.700]  Okay, so I think that's a good idea.
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.660]  Bird Not Bird Draft was another one that we had talked about.
[54:25.660 --> 54:26.740]  Great, great idea, love it.
[54:27.220 --> 54:28.560]  Things that are birds, but not birds.
[54:28.860 --> 54:32.640]  And then a whole loaf of bread sandwich.
[54:35.580 --> 54:39.260]  Yeah, so those are things that we talked about recently that we need to revisit and think
[54:39.260 --> 54:39.480]  of.
[54:40.780 --> 54:44.080]  I have an idea that I wanted to kick around a little bit and just kind of see what you
[54:44.080 --> 54:51.400]  guys think and kind of what the audience thinks also, but I'm more curious about just sort
[54:51.400 --> 54:52.440]  of like your feelings on it.
[54:53.440 --> 54:57.840]  I brought it up to Geoff, I think, like the other day, and so I felt like the Sausage
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.580]  Shock was a good environment for it where I listened to a podcast called Threedom.
[55:02.580 --> 55:04.840]  That has a new episode every week.
[55:05.780 --> 55:10.220]  And something they started doing probably like a year or two ago is they have a thing
[55:10.220 --> 55:14.840]  on their RSS feed, a regular RSS feed, that they just title Three Visiting.
[55:15.120 --> 55:19.880]  And it just, they just put up an old episode.
[55:20.700 --> 55:21.780]  They don't do anything to it.
[55:21.860 --> 55:25.360]  They don't like, hey, hey, here we are presenting this thing.
[55:25.500 --> 55:28.880]  It is just a re-upload of that old episode.
[55:28.880 --> 55:33.020]  And I find myself listening to every single one of those old episodes.
[55:33.580 --> 55:37.460]  Is that something that we maybe want to try?
[55:37.620 --> 55:41.020]  Because I feel like a lot of people go back and like re-listen to this podcast.
[55:41.560 --> 55:48.980]  And I wonder if putting up old f*** face episodes doesn't even have to be, it could
[55:48.980 --> 55:49.520]  be an order.
[55:49.860 --> 55:52.220]  It could be ones that we just want to put out or whatever.
[55:52.460 --> 55:53.500]  The same RSS feed.
[55:53.500 --> 56:00.640]  So if our episode comes out Wednesday, maybe it's a Friday thing where it just, where,
[56:00.880 --> 56:05.060]  you know, an old f*** face episode goes out on Friday or Sunday or something like that.
[56:05.060 --> 56:07.440]  We have like a syndicate, syndication slot.
[56:07.800 --> 56:08.100]  Yeah.
[56:08.480 --> 56:12.820]  Essentially, it's just an old episode of f*** face because there's a lot, if you wanted
[56:12.820 --> 56:18.320]  to go back and listen to 66, like episode 66 of f*** face, like the old show, you got
[56:18.320 --> 56:20.020]  to scroll for like a really long time.
[56:20.100 --> 56:23.480]  And I'm not saying this solves that problem, but I am saying that I think it's a fun way
[56:23.480 --> 56:29.480]  to reintroduce a back catalog that is a lot of fun to listen to, that I never would go
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.900]  back and listen to this podcast if they didn't present it to me.
[56:33.960 --> 56:35.900]  And I listened to every single one.
[56:36.460 --> 56:40.300]  I just worry about that being annoying for people who are listening and they want, you
[56:40.300 --> 56:43.600]  know, one episode to end and the next episode to play, but suddenly it's jumped back four
[56:43.600 --> 56:43.920]  years.
[56:45.780 --> 56:48.420]  I, I, I don't consume stuff like that.
[56:48.460 --> 56:51.960]  So I'd never occurred to me that that's the way that people listen to this stuff.
[56:53.500 --> 56:54.360]  But I, I don't know.
[56:54.440 --> 56:57.700]  I just wanted to get your guys' opinion on this thing.
[56:57.840 --> 57:01.340]  I love the idea of highlighting old content in that way.
[57:01.440 --> 57:04.280]  I, I, I think it's a really cool idea.
[57:04.480 --> 57:11.020]  I, um, my only concern would be the war, war of the worlds of it, where I would hate for
[57:11.020 --> 57:14.240]  people to get confused if they weren't, if they didn't understand what was going on and
[57:14.240 --> 57:16.200]  suddenly like lose themselves.
[57:16.200 --> 57:20.560]  And it's, we're talking about 2022 stuff and they're like, they feel like disconnected from
[57:20.560 --> 57:21.320]  the podcast for a second.
[57:21.420 --> 57:22.340]  I would hate for that to happen.
[57:22.340 --> 57:25.840]  But if it was clearly messaged, I, I don't think I have an issue with it.
[57:25.880 --> 57:31.260]  I'd love to hear the audience's feedback on this one, which is part of why we do these
[57:31.260 --> 57:33.480]  sausage talks to pull them directly as well.
[57:33.560 --> 57:38.320]  Because I do think some way to highlight the older episodes, especially the first like
[57:38.320 --> 57:42.720]  60 or so, which aren't on, I guess they are on YouTube now because of the compilations
[57:42.720 --> 57:43.360]  we've been doing.
[57:44.160 --> 57:47.420]  But, um, yeah, they were a little less easy to find, I guess.
[57:47.980 --> 57:51.380]  I think we have a mechanism that makes a lot of sense to do this easily.
[57:51.380 --> 57:54.300]  And maybe we could do something fun with it where we have a time machine.
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.120]  Maybe somebody is going back through time and ending up in these episodes.
[57:58.580 --> 58:02.320]  And that is at the beginning of all of these old episodes that are being brought forward
[58:02.320 --> 58:04.960]  is a little time machine segment.
[58:05.060 --> 58:08.540]  And maybe there's a little bit of like an overarching thing with that.
[58:08.940 --> 58:10.060]  I do like that.
[58:10.440 --> 58:11.780]  Yeah, I like the time machine.
[58:11.980 --> 58:13.520]  I like regulation syndication.
[58:14.040 --> 58:14.280]  Yeah.
[58:14.400 --> 58:20.100]  So like I, so I just dropped a, uh, an image of like what it looks like in their RSS feed
[58:20.100 --> 58:22.500]  that makes sense to me where it's, here's three visiting.
[58:22.680 --> 58:23.640]  So you know it's an old one.
[58:24.100 --> 58:27.260]  And then, again, here's the new one.
[58:27.380 --> 58:28.080]  And then the old one.
[58:28.220 --> 58:28.800]  And then the new one.
[58:29.240 --> 58:30.920]  I understand what you're saying about confusion.
[58:31.120 --> 58:32.520]  I've never once been confused.
[58:33.380 --> 58:35.380]  Unless I go back and listen to all of these.
[58:35.580 --> 58:38.380]  Like they, they just put a new one out and I just put it, I listen to it again.
[58:38.520 --> 58:39.620]  I've never once been confused.
[58:39.820 --> 58:41.220]  You're just so smart though.
[58:41.360 --> 58:42.260]  Yeah, yeah, you know me.
[58:42.340 --> 58:43.220]  Big brain over here.
[58:43.460 --> 58:48.980]  Uh, I just, I think that it's so much fun to listen to like the old ones.
[58:48.980 --> 58:52.160]  And not even a way like, oh my god, can you believe they said that back then?
[58:52.500 --> 58:57.340]  It's just like, it's more of the thing that I like in a way that I wouldn't have revisited
[58:57.980 --> 58:59.320]  in any other way, shape, or form.
[58:59.540 --> 59:03.640]  I think it'd be really fun to do as like a four episode, maybe test
[59:03.640 --> 59:07.440]  and see like how the audience reacts to it and do a time machine thing.
[59:07.520 --> 59:09.940]  Do you sort of an Eat-tober type thing with it?
[59:10.080 --> 59:10.500]  Test it out?
[59:10.920 --> 59:11.740]  Yeah, do a trial run.
[59:11.760 --> 59:12.460]  I like that idea.
[59:13.220 --> 59:15.500]  Because it's one of those things where like if the audience likes it more than
[59:15.500 --> 59:17.440]  the audience hates it, we should do it, right?
[59:17.620 --> 59:17.940]  Absolutely.
[59:18.480 --> 59:22.120]  And I don't think it's, would it be that hard to do like a two minute
[59:22.120 --> 59:24.760]  time machine edition before those recordings?
[59:25.240 --> 59:27.700]  But played before the episode for the upload?
[59:28.100 --> 59:31.080]  Speaking for Nick and Eric, I'd say no, it's not hard at all.
[59:31.240 --> 59:32.300]  Two minutes is pretty long.
[59:32.720 --> 59:33.840]  They can do it, they're talented.
[59:34.400 --> 59:36.040]  Would it be the same thing for every two?
[59:36.160 --> 59:37.900]  No, I think each one has a different thing.
[59:38.720 --> 59:39.600]  Oh, okay.
[59:39.880 --> 59:43.200]  I think there's a narrative of the time machine and like you keep
[59:43.200 --> 59:46.960]  whoever, could be different people, different parts, but...
[59:46.960 --> 59:50.100]  Maybe we could like do summaries of what we talk about in that one or something.
[59:50.540 --> 59:52.200]  That doesn't even necessarily need to be summaries.
[59:52.280 --> 59:55.100]  It could just be a ridiculous thing.
[59:55.800 --> 59:56.820]  What would we be talking about?
[59:57.160 --> 59:58.560]  Just saying that it's old?
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.480]  You could be like, attention regulation listeners, it's your old pal buddy
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.580]  Geoff and I'm surfing the slipstream today and I've wound up on the release date of October 3rd,
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.360]  2021 and we're face episode 67 and I can't stay, but I'm going to leave it here for you.
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:15.440]  Enjoy this look into the past.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.460]  I just think it's, I think adding something to the beginning is just like,
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:27.960]  it's overthinking what can be a very easy, like...
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.060]  I think the show is overthinking.
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.680]  It's a very easy like lever to pull or whatever.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.740]  And I just, I don't want to add anything to like Nick's plate that needs to be more difficult.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.000]  But if you guys are into it and you want to try it, that's fine.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.200]  I want to know what the audience thinks.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.900]  Like, I know there are a lot of people who go back and like listen to this stuff.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  And I don't, again, I don't want to confuse
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.420]  the audience with something that's coming out on the same RSS feed or whatever.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.080]  This is just a thing that I've enjoyed from a podcast that I listened to that
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:55.280]  I wanted to bring here and see if there was any interest in doing it.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.620]  I'm fine if you guys want to record something,
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.480]  because if we want to record something for like the beginning and give it a shot,
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.700]  I'm totally into that.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:03.920]  I'm definitely interested in this idea.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:06.680]  That was a great idea when you brought it up and I still think it's a great idea.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:07.940]  It is interesting.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.600]  I think looking at the feed too, we have a lot of episodes that go back to back sometimes
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.500]  where we don't have weeks where we have supplemental content that has an audio component
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.020]  to it. But when we have a lot of those in a row, like, for instance, this past week,
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:23.860]  for when we put this out, we had Regulation Takes and the interview with Sheen.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.720]  And those were back to back as supplementals, plus then an episode.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.540]  And then you get one of these in between that can add a lot of things into the feed.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:36.280]  So that would be my only concern with keeping it clean, like a consistent kind of clean.
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:36.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:39.760]  We're already, I mean, clearly we're already not keeping it clean.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.840]  No, but I mean, even adding that then is just one more additional thing.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.760]  It might be easier to denote with like a piece of artwork or something to go with like meta.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.240]  Audience, you gotta let us know. This is one of those times where we
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.080]  definitely want to hear from you and want to hear your take on it.
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.760]  Yeah, I'm interested in what they say.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:03.720]  I also, is it like a thing that's good at some points, but maybe if something changes
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:09.260]  with the system, it's bad? Like if everyone was skipping these, does it affect discoverability?
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:11.640]  Or is it, is there no like algorithm like that?
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.640]  I don't know.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.280]  I hadn't thought about that, the algorithm part of it.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.680]  Yeah, I'm just worried that it's like something we try now.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.960]  And then two years down the line, they're like,
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:25.680]  oh, if you have a lot of people skipping your episodes, we won't show them to them.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.200]  And then it's like, oh, we've screwed ourselves two years ago or something.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:30.640]  But I don't know.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.240]  I don't know if there's any system like that in place for podcasts or Spotify or Apple or anything.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.620]  Okay, so I mean, we'll leave it to the audience and see what they think about it.
[01:02:38.620 --> 01:02:42.540]  But I'm fine with trying the time machine thing too.
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.600]  Like if people are like into it or whatever.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.360]  And yeah, we can see if it's something that we want to explore.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.940]  I kind of feel like no one way or the other about it other than what I just brought up.
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.460]  So I'm into doing it or not doing it.
[01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.800]  Like if it falls through, then I truly have no hard feelings about it whatsoever.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:03.020]  That's a really cool idea that I wouldn't have thought of.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.020]  I'm definitely into doing it, personally.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.520]  Was there anything else, Eric?
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.260]  Looking at the list, I don't think so.
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.300]  There is a one grain of rice cook-off, but I'll leave that to you.
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.340]  I vote thumbs down, but that's just me personally.
[01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:19.100]  Put it in the barrel.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:19.660]  Thumbs down.
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.220]  One grain of rice.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:21.840]  Yeah, put it in the barrel.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.240]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.940]  I have such a list over here of stuff for the barrel.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.660]  I can't wait to get the barrel going.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.100]  Like Smash Dogs, Terminal Velocity, Drop Burger.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.480]  There's so much.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:44.300]  Okay, then I think that's it in terms of ideas or anything like that of what we hadn't talked about.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.040]  Or had or hadn't talked about.
[01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.940]  Anything else you guys want to cover?
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.800]  I know we have questions, but anything else you guys want to cover before we get into that?
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.760]  I've got a thing that I want to bring up right before questions.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:02.840]  I thought it'd be a good idea for this Sausage Talk, if I picked my favorite comment from the last few episodes, or since the last Sausage Talk.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.840]  This was from Patreon, because that's really the only place I look at them.
[01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:13.340]  And someone in response to me asking if there's a hot popsicle, like a soup.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.000]  Someone responded, and I wish I'd written down the name, but I didn't.
[01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:17.620]  Someone wrote,
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.420]  Hotsicle is just sucking dick, bruh.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:25.300]  And that to me, that was my favorite recent comment from one of the comment leavers.
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.960]  Well, right on, man.
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:31.700]  Guys, and that's Gavin's comment moment.
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.120]  Write in your comments on Patreon, and maybe Gavin will pick one for the next Sausage Talk.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.340]  Comment of the quarter.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.620]  Gavin's quarterly comment.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.200]  Yep.
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.980]  Can we get a sausage count for Gavin for this?
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.020]  One thing we should talk about briefly, because it was a big deal and it just happened,
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.780]  before we get into questions, is merchandise.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:02.740]  We just had the Gerpler sale, and I think by all accounts, it went swimmingly.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.180]  We ordered 10,000 Gerplers.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.440]  That was a well-publicized number.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.100]  We sold through them in the 12 to 14-hour range, I think,
[01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:17.720]  which feels pretty good in comparison to where we've been in the past.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.500]  Be nice to have a few on the shelves still for stragglers.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:28.880]  But basically, if you logged into our store on Friday, you got a Gerpler.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.800]  And I feel really good about that.
[01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:31.900]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.420]  We have begun work on the next Gerpler.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.760]  Look for it to be out in the fall.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.300]  It's, you know, I think October, November, somewhere around there, I would assume.
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.600]  We're, you know, very early stages on it.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.800]  It will not be the same Gerpler.
[01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:52.520]  We tend to not revisit the same ideas when we GERP.
[01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:57.580]  In addition to that, the patches are going swimmingly.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.380]  I think the next drop that comes out will be our hat patch combo.
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.640]  And then we need to get to work.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.920]  We have a pigeon patch coming.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.240]  We need to get to work on the next three-pack that we'll have out soon.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.140]  The audience seems to really like those three-packs.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.000]  So we'll probably increase the numbers of those.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.940]  And we're going to dramatically increase the quantity of Kuzlers.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.880]  And I think the Kuzler will just become part and parcel with the Gerpler.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.580]  Whenever we release a Gerpler, we'll release a Kuzler alongside it.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.120]  At least, we haven't discussed that, but I get the feeling that's the way things are headed, right?
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.880]  Yeah, it makes sense to me.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.500]  Yeah, the demand is definitely there.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:36.800]  Absolutely.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:40.100]  And are we fine sticking with the number of GERPs?
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:43.440]  You're happy with 12 hours of sale based on that?
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:44.920]  I am, yeah.
[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.980]  I think that's a great number.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.240]  Until I see the next Gerpler, it's hard to say.
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.840]  Because, honestly, I bumped the number in my head up a little bit
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.480]  just based on how cool the Cosmic Gerpler looked, you know?
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:00.920]  And I think it's by far the best-looking thing we've ever done.
[01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.620]  And I'll just have to see what the next one looks like.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.460]  But yeah, I think that number... we could go up a little bit and see, but, you know...
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.360]  Yeah, we'll, I think, get even more data with the next drop.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.900]  And I think every drop has been super informative
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.600]  in making sure that we can make it the best experience possible for the audience.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.920]  The frustration in the audience is trending down with every GERP, which is great.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.240]  Yeah, I didn't see a lot of frustration.
[01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.760]  I only saw a few of people who were working the whole day.
[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:34.300]  Or people who were like,
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.240]  I didn't bother looking because I didn't think it'd be available,
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.340]  and now I'm kicking myself.
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:39.600]  I saw a few of those, which suck, but...
[01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:41.680]  Yeah, I'm excited for the next GERP.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.800]  It's going to be, from what I've seen, pretty great.
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.500]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:48.680]  I think so, too.
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.040]  But it's got some big GERPs to GERP, you know?
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.640]  That previous GERP one was pretty special.
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:56.220]  It does have some big GERPs to GERP.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.760]  Shall we move into questions?
[01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.900]  Does anyone else have anything that they'd like to bring up?
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.740]  No, let's do it.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.200]  Okay, let's go into questions.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.000]  This is immediately my fault.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.680]  Jake Matthew asks,
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.940]  Where are the rest of the Ratatouille videos?
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.180]  That's on me.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.620]  Aaron's been wanting to Ratatouille.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:13.680]  I've been asking.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:14.900]  I needed to rearrange my desk.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:15.740]  We're going to get on that.
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.960]  I have my 360 set up because we did that thing.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:22.180]  And I'm excited.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:23.440]  Jesus Christ.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.020]  I had to do that.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.900]  I said, and then I processed in my head that that is not out yet.
[01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.940]  That pause was me scheduling in my head.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.480]  When does this come out in relation to that?
[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.680]  That's definitely not out yet.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.140]  We did a 360 thing, so I'm ready to go on Ratatouille.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:37.740]  There will be more Ratatouille in your life soon enough.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.460]  Eric's been asking for it.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.320]  I want to do it.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.700]  I just want to get it done.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:42.580]  I want to finish.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.600]  I want to finish achievement hunting in that game.
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.180]  Next question.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:47.880]  No use for name.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.260]  What are some projects you're most excited about, but are most worried about at the same time?
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.220]  Or projects y'all just have to keep pushing due to timing or scheduling or whatever?
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.740]  For me, it's F*** Face Off season two.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:03.020]  I'm so excited for that.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.260]  We just need to get everybody rounded up for scheduling that.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:10.220]  Summer has been a pretty hectic time for organizing things.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.640]  Are we waiting on anything specifically for that?
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:14.520]  It's the f***ing boots is what we're waiting on.
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:20.500]  We need to have him fulfill his punishment from season one before we can release season two.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.720]  And it's just been hard to pay that off.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.860]  But the payoff is coming.
[01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.260]  We just essentially scheduled it.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.300]  I don't want to give it away, but the payoff is coming.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.460]  It's on the calendar.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.240]  So I'm right there with you, Andrew.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.060]  I've just been desperate to get to F*** Face Off season two.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.920]  There's a lot of hype around it internally within us.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:41.180]  And we just want to be able to do it.
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:46.420]  So as soon as we can get Nick's sweaty little toes in those shoes, we'll be able to move forward.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:47.820]  Let's do it.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.220]  Nick perked up when he said sweaty little toes.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.020]  He got all into it.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.280]  I know how to talk to him.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.320]  Next question, or I guess, do we have any other answers to that?
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.780]  Sorry, I jumped the gun on that.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.300]  Do you guys have ones that you're anticipating or?
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:05.240]  Yeah, the next thing we do for the Wheel of Decades.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.840]  Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.280]  I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:14.120]  And then I'm also not looking because of what we landed on the first time.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.180]  Not looking forward to what it potentially could be.
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:16.860]  Yeah.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:19.640]  I'm excited as well.
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.080]  Learned a lot.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:20.680]  Learned a lot.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.820]  That will be very interesting.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.120]  One thing I'm working on is just finalizing some equipment stuff at the office.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:32.120]  We're trying to move off of the current setup we have in the couch space.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:32.660]  Oh, that's right.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.720]  Yeah, different areas.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.980]  We can do more couch stuff.
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.600]  Yeah, and that'll enable us to use the other room as well for stream purposes.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.100]  So we have a few things that we want to get set up and tested out.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.640]  It's just finding the time in between recordings.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.680]  Geoff, anything else at the office you've been working on that you want to tease
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.280]  and say that you're excited to do soon?
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:56.660]  I'm pretty excited about getting back, going on the break room and the break show.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.240]  We should be really close there.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:03.400]  I feel like we're in the 94% tile range or something in terms of completion.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.540]  It really is.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.120]  It just looks like a messy, sweaty, gross room.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:13.180]  But once we cast Prestidigitation on it, it'll be all fine.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.380]  Perfect.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.680]  The office is in a great spot now where we've done four player gameplay in there.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.860]  And I just feel like it's a great spot to just come in and sit down and make stuff now.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:24.960]  I'm there right now.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:28.040]  Prestidigitation. Fuck me.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.700]  Great work. I'm at the I'm at the office right now.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.820]  It's it's awesome. Except for that toilet. Everything else is good.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.940]  Shit, it don't work.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.360]  Yep. Should it don't work.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.600]  Next question from Evan Hub 40.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:43.200]  My question to you all is who do you think among you would be
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.200]  most able to kick their way out of a child infested space?
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.500]  I think Nick.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:48.940]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.760]  Although I thought Nick could crawl through that that tube faster than Gavin.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.080]  Gavin kind of killed it.
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.700]  But you took an injury in that, didn't you, Gavin?
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:01.980]  Nick beat me in that, but I got I scuffed up on my arms.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.040]  Oh, did Nick beat you in my memory?
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.320]  You beat Nick?
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.540]  No, Nick. Nick smoked him.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.220]  OK, well, then it's Nick all the way.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.580]  Then this is an overly question.
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:11.180]  Nick's definitely.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:15.260]  I got hurt in the first run and it affected my confidence in the second run.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.820]  We got to revisit it then, right?
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.140]  Rematch.
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.660]  I'm really nervous that we didn't win Larry King's keys.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.140]  Yeah, well, that's not out yet.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.560]  Yeah, but the auction is in 20 hours.
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.920]  So no, I mean, like takes part two.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:36.060]  Oh, that's fine.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.660]  They don't know what we're talking about.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:38.300]  Of course.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.000]  Are there any?
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.320]  Yeah, Gavin, of course.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.160]  Of course.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:42.780]  It's fine.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.840]  They still don't know what we're talking about.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.700]  Next question is from Steve McKearney.
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.280]  Are there any upcoming games you guys have planned to play that you can tease?
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.100]  I have one that people seem really excited about us playing Battlefield six.
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:59.060]  So that is one that I'm excited to play with you guys.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:04.060]  I'm not typically a Battlefield guy, but I've heard nothing but good things about this new one.
[01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:07.960]  And it definitely seems like there's a lot of people in the audience that want us to play.
[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.940]  What do you think, Gavin?
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.200]  We played it this weekend together.
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:13.220]  Yeah, I played with Geoff and the Trump boys and it was very fun.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.500]  Oh, it's awesome.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:15.720]  I'm so glad to hear that.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:22.260]  I never know how like serious FPS is going to translate to entertaining video, you know,
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.360]  but it is a lot of fun to play and it's a gorgeous game, like absolutely beautiful.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.860]  There's also like really just cinematic stuff that happens naturally that's interesting.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.620]  And there's just like moments where you're like, holy shit, did you see that?
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.480]  I do feel like I spent the four hours we played going,
[01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.580]  just explaining to the guys what just happened in front of me.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.100]  No, you're not.
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:44.620]  You don't understand.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:49.500]  Then the helicopter crashed in front of me and the rotor went right over my head,
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.020]  right over my head.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.760]  I think it'll be a lot of fun to check out and will be a great video.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.580]  Next question from Phoenix Exalt.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.800]  Will there ever be more golden gerplers?
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.040]  It was such a cool concept.
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.780]  We never really talked about that internally.
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.780]  I have my gut feel on it.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:11.980]  I personally lean towards a no, but I'd love to hear what you guys say.
[01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:18.060]  I think it was like a really fun idea when we did it and I'm not against doing it again,
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:22.640]  but also like, I don't feel the need to revisit that idea specifically.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.460]  Like, it's cool, but you know.
[01:14:26.740 --> 01:14:27.560]  I'm right there with Eric.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.640]  I liked the idea.
[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.420]  I'm certainly open to creating more of them if the idea warrants it.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.100]  But if the idea was just redo the thing we already did a second time,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.000]  I don't find that to be particularly appealing.
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.500]  Yeah, so there was some sort of a clever way to do it that made sense.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.160]  Absolutely.
[01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:51.840]  But I don't want to just I don't want to get into just like reruns of what we're doing.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:52.680]  Totally.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:15:00.980]  I think there's a mechanism there or an idea of like a chase type thing that's fun.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.380]  And chase isn't even necessarily.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:08.100]  But like a variation is kind of cool because we typically only do one color of gerp.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:11.280]  That's the only time we've had multi-gerp colors release.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.400]  So I don't like my interest in doing more gold gerplers specifically in the way that we did it
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.580]  doesn't really exist.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:23.320]  But the idea of there being like a twist on a release of a gerpler, I think is a lot of fun.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.980]  And, you know, the idea of there being content around it, too.
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.080]  Like we had the USB drives in those golden gerps, right?
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:30.940]  With a special video.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.480]  I thought that was that was the thing that was fun to me about it.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:33.820]  Yeah.
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.820]  Was it ten that went out?
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.140]  Absolutely.
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:36.060]  Ten golden gerps?
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:36.360]  Yeah.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:36.740]  Yeah.
[01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:41.840]  And then we put the Vernon on the on the video.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.620]  So that way we knew which one shared it.
[01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.820]  Yeah. Which leaker it was. I think it was number six that leaked it.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:48.860]  Yep. Yep.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.980]  I still haven't seen that video.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.140]  Oh, it's good.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:59.120]  I experienced it, but like I never watched the posted leak.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.100]  Does that just on like YouTube? Can I just find that on YouTube?
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.000]  I think it's on their YouTube, right?
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:05.180]  Yeah. Just look at Goldeney.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.620]  I believe that was my first Coke.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.160]  Really?
[01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:10.180]  Yeah.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.000]  Wow.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.020]  Yep.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.240]  What a moment. Next question by Brian Ford.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.300]  The interview with Shane was awesome.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.700]  As of now, are there any plans to have more interview slash supplemental content similar to that?
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.500]  Or if there aren't plans, would you be open to it?
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.220]  I'd certainly be open to it if it made sense. Like it's not like a thing.
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:33.360]  If anyone spoke as much regulation as Shaheen, I think it would make total sense.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.260]  Absolutely.
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:36.480]  But it would have to be like they're in the universe.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.060]  It has to like within our world makes sense. I'm not like we're not in the same way that
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.760]  we're always open to doing drafts. I don't think there's any interest in
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.940]  regularly doing interviews in any capacity.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:55.680]  It was awesome and such a just a lightning in a bottle thing that Shaheen,
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:01.120]  who happened to work with us on the hirejudge.com thing, was on Survivor,
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.960]  which is a show that we're all mostly really big fans of.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:08.960]  Like that was just like, that was an amazing amount of kismet that you just don't expect.
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.940]  But we didn't interview him because of Survivor. We interviewed him because of
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:15.440]  the pencil judge thing. Yes.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:19.160]  And the Survivor thing was just like this wild, happy accident that put him in front
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:24.280]  of us in a public way that kind of made all set the wheels in motion.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:30.080]  But I think that the thing about it is though is that it was the connection to the show that
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.240]  we wanted to explore. And so I had to just aren't going to be a lot of people that are
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.120]  going to have a connection to our show in that way.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.700]  Yeah, I mean, he's already been heard speaking on the main show.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.460]  So that's true. Makes sense.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.020]  But there's not a lot of other people who have done that.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.180]  And it's and at some point you're just interviewing Jack again, you know?
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:57.740]  It's also, I think, a really great time to like, once again, we talk about this all the time.
[01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:00.540]  Our community is so absurd and amazing.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:04.300]  That is a connection that only happened because of the community.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:08.220]  That is not a thing that I would have ever connected the dots on.
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.540]  But it was people that are listening to the show and are passionate about it,
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:16.940]  sharing that connection and then enabling us to actually connect with him.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.820]  Like, I would have had no, it very easily could be a thing where I watched Survivor
[01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.960]  and had no concept that he was the pencil judge.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:28.960]  The only reason why that was ever discovered was because of people in our community talking about it.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.000]  And just so thankful.
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:33.680]  The community is very on top of it in that way.
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:41.160]  And I think this is by far the community that has the most similar vibe to the people making the show.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:47.720]  Like, I've been a part of communities where every idea is pretty, I don't know, just doesn't fit.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.320]  The regulation community has tremendous ideas, I feel like, because they speak regulation
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.480]  and they sort of know the vibe of it.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.180]  Tremendous ideas and execution.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.820]  I just love that there's somebody out there that made a hot dog counting website for the community.
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:02.800]  Yeah, exactly that kind of thing.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.380]  I completely agree with you, Gavin.
[01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:13.540]  As somebody who's been lucky enough to participate in online communities for 23-ish years now,
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.560]  there's been nothing like this in the history of my experience.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.640]  There really hasn't.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:25.320]  Not to like, not to, you know, blow the audience while I'm cradling their balls or anything,
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:33.800]  but it really is just a fucking special and unique community that has kind of formed around us.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.540]  They made several Christmas albums.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:36.500]  Fucking crazy.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.600]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.420]  You're only cradling the balls, not the vaginas?
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.020]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'm also cradling the vaginas.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.640]  It's all the balls in that episode.
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:47.860]  I'm up, I'm up.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.480]  Dude, I'm, I'm awash in genitals as a thank you.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.740]  But yeah, I'm going to get Geoff out of this and go to the next question,
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.460]  which is written by the one and only Spummer with an unlimited budget.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.200]  What show or series would you like to create?
[01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.020]  I'm of all the people here, I think I'm most interested in Gavin's answer.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:10.420]  Really?
[01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.720]  Yeah, I feel like you, I don't know.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.780]  With slow-mo guys, you deal with explosions and stuff.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.860]  I just feel like...
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.520]  What, you think we should bring explosions to regulation?
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:25.360]  I don't know, I just feel like you work on a larger scale than we do typically.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.700]  Yeah, I think maybe I would just do, I would do more like regulation related trips.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.600]  Regulation trips, regulation field trips.
[01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.180]  Like if we have an idea that can only be done in
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:40.160]  some random city in some random state, it could be like, hey, you want to go on Friday?
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.300]  I think with an unlimited budget, what show or series would you like to create?
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:49.040]  I would like to recreate Mad Mad World or Rat Race with the community.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.520]  That would be the goal.
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.760]  An insane scavenger hunt would be fantastic.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:56.540]  How about you, Nick or Eric?
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:58.620]  I don't know, like...
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.340]  It is tough because budget like so rarely factors in.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.200]  Yeah, that's how I feel.
[01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:05.520]  That's the thing.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:10.280]  And even like budget for travel isn't really that much of an issue for us.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.200]  It's more of a component of time.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:13.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:16.760]  And by that, I mean, not like we have the budget, it's unlimited.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:20.700]  It's that I don't think on a scale that would require a large budget.
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:23.680]  I struggle, and it's going to sound like a cop out answer,
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:27.520]  but I struggle to think of something that I've wanted to make a regulation
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.020]  that hasn't been achievable.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:32.460]  Yeah, and it's almost never hindered by budget.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.440]  Like, I love the fact that we were able to make
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.940]  what I think was a really funny, good video
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:40.860]  for the cost of four sandwiches the other day.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:44.100]  Yeah, yeah, that is absolutely that is my sweet spot.
[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:49.220]  Like I came into this industry making a production company out of two Xboxes,
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.660]  you know, like that was my ceiling.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.300]  The only reason back in Achievement Hunter,
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.080]  we did shows like Haunter and Hardcore and Last Laugh
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.460]  that had these inflated budgets
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:05.860]  is because they approached me, by they I mean management,
[01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:06.660]  approached me and said,
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.940]  Think big. What's your big budget idea?
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.620]  We have money. We need to spend it. We want to spend it.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.460]  Give us your best big budget ideas.
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.300]  So we then went to the drawing board and came up with ideas for them.
[01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:20.780]  But those weren't ideas that I would have naturally even landed on in that.
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:23.960]  Like anything we want to do, I feel like we can do
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:26.800]  because I think all of our ideas are fairly achievable.
[01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:28.920]  You know what it is for me?
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.680]  Survive Block Island was a really fun idea that I know that we had talked about,
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.700]  that people like really loved.
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.740]  I really kind of don't feel one way or another about it.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.900]  I think it's a really cool show.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.640]  And I would love to do more of that if there was something like that,
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.040]  where like the budget didn't matter.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.600]  We could get all of our friends and do that stuff.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:50.960]  I think what I would want to do is make a mini golf game.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.720]  We talked about that previously,
[01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:56.060]  sort of brought up in like other stuff or whatever,
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:59.420]  but a mini golf video game that was like...
[01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.380]  Nobody's making them.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.080]  Make it regulation themed and like around this stuff or whatever,
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.300]  but very much in the vein of like...
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:08.620]  Dude.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:11.120]  3D Ultra Mini Golf would be so fucking cool.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.700]  Mini golf menace.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.540]  And you can fuck with each other.
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.580]  That's the game.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.680]  Four player, boom.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.240]  Regulation golf.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:17.560]  Exactly.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:18.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.940]  That to me would be if it's all budget and we have an idea
[01:23:22.940 --> 01:23:25.060]  and people are like executing on this thing.
[01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:26.640]  Look, I don't know how to make a game
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.160]  and I don't know how to execute on that thing.
[01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:30.720]  But if it's, you know, a pie in the sky idea,
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:34.120]  then that would probably be mine is making that kind of thing.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.200]  Because I think that would be a lot of fun.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.280]  That's a great idea.
[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:39.500]  Thought on just a quick note on budget.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.420]  It's just funny timing.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.040]  I was talking to a friend yesterday
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:45.860]  and they asked about a podcast budget
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.360]  and that type of thing and brought up this item
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.780]  for us to acquire that is so absurdly...
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.740]  like so out of the realm of any possibility.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:56.900]  And it was like a fair ride.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:00.580]  And I was like, no, that's fucking like, no, like that's absurd.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.360]  What are you talking about?
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.920]  And then they replied, oh, don't you know what?
[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.740]  You needed the Warner money for that to make that happen.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.760]  And I love that perception because at the end,
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.900]  I couldn't get us new Xboxes.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.000]  The premise that we had the Warner money at any point
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.600]  to buy a fair ride is hilarious to me.
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.360]  I mean, you bought the Portapotty yourself, right?
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.760]  Yes, I was out of pocket.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.900]  Moving on to the next question by Will.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.400]  Will there be a Russian fuck hat patch for the patch hat?
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.500]  Also for Geoff, long time since we've had an update.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.280]  How are your teeth slash jaw doing?
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.600]  I'll say yes, I'm a thumbs up for the for the patch idea
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.880]  if the other guys are OK with it.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.740]  I think it's on the list of potential.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:46.600]  There may have even been a mock up of it already
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.280]  because we had, I think, like 10 or 12 mocked up initially.
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.440]  And then my mouth's fine. It's great.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.780]  I was having those issues. I think it was due to clenching my jaw.
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.580]  I've been using a mouth guard.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:03.560]  Just recently, the issues started on the other side of my mouth,
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.380]  but I recognized it went to the dentist just to make sure there's nothing there.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.460]  And I think it's all just related to stress.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.300]  And so I'm learning not to clench my jaw and to relax.
[01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:12.680]  Thank you.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.760]  Nice. Awesome.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.180]  Yeah, I'm all for the Russian fuck hat thing.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:21.240]  I just I don't that design is like a spell to me.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.780]  I don't understand because it was a random accident.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.320]  I don't I always don't understand how we can recreate it.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.200]  I don't know how they did it the first time.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.860]  That's why I am never personally pushing for it,
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:33.760]  because I just don't understand how we can even do it.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.920]  They recreate it pretty well for the shirt and the hat we made.
[01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:37.880]  They sure did.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.560]  If we have those assets, I guess we could just reuse them.
[01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:43.440]  But that is always the hold up in my mind.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:49.840]  I love the idea of selling a patch that was a hat and a shirt
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.480]  that could be stuck on a different hat and a different shirt.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:55.120]  I completely agree.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:58.120]  That's so many layers deep, it's almost hard to think about.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.200]  It's pretty good.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.760]  We are running a bit long, so maybe I'll do like one or two more.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.040]  There's so many amazing questions.
[01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:09.600]  Thank you so much to all the Falcons who submitted them.
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.740]  Here is one for Mr. Fedora.
[01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:15.980]  A lot of people make clips, highlights, and compilations of your work.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.320]  How do you guys feel about that?
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.500]  Obviously, I'm monetized.
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.720]  Do you find they help draw people to your work, steal views from you,
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:24.900]  steal views from you, or is it just something that comes
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:27.200]  from being an online presence for so many years?
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.680]  Do these kinds of things annoy you guys, or does it not matter to you?
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.260]  I've always seen that as like a great indicator of a thriving community, to be honest.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:36.640]  Absolutely.
[01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:36.980]  I agree.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:37.660]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:38.920]  I think it's so cool.
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.320]  Nothing against it.
[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:40.080]  I think it's great.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.300]  Our views aren't that precious.
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.300]  No, but we really said that when we were starting this company.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:50.880]  We were like, we're not going to try to chase...
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:53.600]  We have to be mindful of an algorithm, but we're not trying to chase an algorithm.
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.780]  We're not trying to chase views with what we're doing.
[01:26:56.060 --> 01:26:59.040]  We need to be mindful of what we're doing, but we can just...
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.360]  We make what we want to make and do what we want to do here.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.200]  And I think that...
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:05.120]  I don't know how you guys feel about this, but people are like,
[01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.680]  oh, you know, they make compilations and it's unmonetized.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.420]  Me personally, I don't care necessarily if it's monetized or not.
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.360]  I don't feel like you're taking money out of my pocket.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:19.180]  I think you're doing a real service by getting these compilations to do stuff and whatever.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:23.680]  So more to me, you know, it's obviously going to be a case-by-case thing.
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:26.400]  If it turns into some other...
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:29.060]  I know with other channels at other points, it turned into like,
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.540]  yeah, I make these compilations and here's my Patreon.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.020]  And then getting upset with people that are watching these other videos.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.660]  I've just seen it happen in other communities.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:39.720]  As long as it doesn't broach that.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.980]  It's like, I just make the video. I think it's great.
[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:46.860]  If it's striking you creatively that you want to compile and do those things,
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.560]  more power to you. I think it's phenomenal.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.640]  And thank you very much.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.300]  The compilations that the audience makes, in my opinion,
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.440]  is always better than anything that we would produce ourselves.
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.680]  Absolutely. I totally agree with that.
[01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:00.920]  We've been down this road before in the past with Achievement Hunter.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.160]  And Gavin is 100% correct.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.900]  For whatever reason, the compilation that the audience makes
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:11.440]  is always going to be better and better received than the compilation
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.080]  that the creator makes.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.260]  So you do a better job than we could capturing what it is that you like about the show
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.780]  versus what it is we think you like about the show that we clipped together for you.
[01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.500]  But in addition, at the end of the day, I think the easiest way to look at it is
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.940]  just make no mistakes about it, audience.
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.560]  We are a Patreon-driven show.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:34.660]  We exist because of the patrons on Patreon who pay for us every month.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.900]  YouTube to us is an advertisement.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.180]  It is a commercial.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:42.900]  We put our videos up on YouTube to find audience to let them know about us
[01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.480]  so that hopefully they will go to Patreon at some point.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.500]  If not, that's cool.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.160]  They can still enjoy it on YouTube.
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.920]  But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter to me if they're watching
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:54.040]  your compilation video of us on YouTube or us on YouTube.
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:54.600]  It's both.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.420]  Both of them are commercials for us.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.220]  The biggest battle that we have and we've talked about,
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.740]  sir, I don't know how much we've said kind of externally or whatever.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.980]  It's some, but internally, the biggest battle that we have as a company and like as a show
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:11.640]  is that nobody knows that we're doing this.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:14.220]  And you're looking at views and everything.
[01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.020]  You're like, oh, people know people are listening and all this stuff every day.
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:23.880]  Oh, I didn't know Geoff and Gavin were making videos still every day, every single day.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:29.580]  It like it is such an uphill battle to inform an audience that wants to see this stuff,
[01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:31.980]  but they have no idea about it.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.560]  And like that's it's hard.
[01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.960]  And so like these compilations reach a different audience and I'm all for it.
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:38.660]  I think they're great.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:39.240]  Absolutely.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.100]  I think it's also like on top of just the willingness and like the
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:50.080]  enjoyment of the thing so much that you want to make a compilation for it is
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.660]  incredibly touching and appreciated, I think, by all of us.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:59.320]  As well as just on like a it's a weird personal thing of largely what we do is comedic,
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.280]  like 99% of it.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:05.200]  So the idea that like any of us could say something that made someone laugh so much
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.000]  or just enjoy that moment so much that they want to clip it and then share it with other people
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:15.020]  is so just absurdly touching in sort of a unique way.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.240]  It's a very gratifying and humbling thing.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:18.120]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:24.980]  It means that some the idea that some dumb thing you said has some sort of value.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.460]  You know what I mean?
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.040]  Yeah.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:30.940]  The final question by Jack Linehart.
[01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:35.380]  What's the most complicated post-production process y'all had to deal with?
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.080]  To me, immediately, what comes to mind is Mario Party March.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:42.960]  But I'd love to know, Nick, if there was something on the production side for you
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.500]  that was just a fucking nightmare that like might not be obvious that it was a disaster.
[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.280]  Uh, I'm trying to think.
[01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:52.960]  That was probably the most intense thing that we did was either
[01:30:54.160 --> 01:31:00.320]  gathering all the files and figuring out how to post for either the advent calendar
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:02.660]  or Mario Party March.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:05.800]  But Mario Party March was also one of those complications just because
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.660]  it was so many different R files.
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:10.040]  We had the Craig backup.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:14.140]  And if you know what a Craig is, it's basically a recording system for Discord.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:17.540]  So it's just it's lesser quality, but it's still better than nothing.
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:18.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:22.380]  And then also just getting the video from that.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:29.380]  I would say sometimes when we do certain streams,
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:36.430]  being able to like we ran into this issue recently where we're trying to figure out
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.340]  audio settings when we have to stream through Discord.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.920]  Actually, you know what?
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:46.800]  A really good example of this happening in real time was when we did the Donkey Kong stream.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.300]  Because we found out very quickly that Andrew's machine
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:57.020]  wasn't quite able to handle the 2K stream that initially he was doing.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.320]  And then after that, we pivoted to him sharing his screen with us through Discord.
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:10.000]  And I streamed that and then being able to utilize that, his actual recording from that
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.580]  for the VOD as opposed to using the live stream that I put out just because it had better
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.840]  video and it also has the audio from the game.
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.720]  So those are probably the most complicated things,
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:23.800]  even though they're like the usual quick turnaround things.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.500]  It's just figuring out how to plug and play all that stuff
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.760]  after a live stream because it's a quick turnaround.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:32.200]  Absolutely.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.140]  Anything jump out to you guys?
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:34.960]  Yeah.
[01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:37.960]  No, nothing that we've really done.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.020]  It's like things that we've recovered.
[01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:46.740]  Like we did a... Geoff, Gavin and I did a FBC Firebreak 4,
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.300]  which is one of the rare things we lost just completely because I didn't have footage.
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.820]  I think Gavin didn't have footage. Audio was broken.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.140]  Like it just it fell apart. It was piece by piece.
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:04.240]  It was only my video and then two audios, I think.
[01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.940]  Yeah. So it's like we have those where it's just like they're disastrous,
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:12.120]  but not recoverable, but in the sense of like,
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.820]  what is something that was a nightmare that we're able to make work?
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.960]  Getting that guillotine in the fucking room.
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:28.920]  Andrew, when you and Geoff and I ended up watching the Pink Panther.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:29.880]  Yes.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:33.920]  For whatever reason, when we were capturing the wheel,
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.140]  that we lost that footage.
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.060]  And it's like that's the whole impetus for the episode, right?
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.800]  It's about spinning the wheel to see what you're going to end up watching that week,
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:46.580]  right? Because it's about remakes of good movies.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:49.560]  And we're watching the potentially bad remake of that movie.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:55.840]  But the whole thing was we were we picked it landed on one thing that we did not have access
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.940]  to, which led to a spinning again and laying on Pink Panther that was completely lost.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.660]  So I had to recreate that moment visually.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:06.480]  But it's like re-spin the wheel until it landed on Pink Panther.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:11.640]  Yes. But on my third try, it landed on Pink Panther and then I spun it again.
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:15.200]  I'm sorry. On the third try, it landed on the initial one it landed on for us.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:19.880]  And then on the very next spin that I did, because it was just a continuous file that
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:22.660]  I was doing, it landed on Pink Panther in the exact same time.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:23.280]  Wow.
[01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:24.560]  Which is insane.
[01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:29.340]  It is insane. What's funny is that the way that you so I sent you all the information.
[01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.740]  The reshoot that you did was not how the wheel looked when we did it.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.640]  You put it in in a different way.
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:38.880]  So there were comments of people.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:41.500]  I don't remember what it was, but there are comments of being like,
[01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.480]  Andrew's acting like this one visually.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.180]  Like, what's he talking about?
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:51.600]  And it's like, you are not seeing like it is a recreation, but it is not recreated in
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.940]  the way that it was when we recorded it.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:54.760]  That's great.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:55.820]  That's so funny.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:59.540]  With stuff like that, though, I feel like I'm fine just having a little disclaimer being
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.640]  like, oh, we lost this footage.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.480]  This is a recreation just so people are less confused.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:04.180]  That's a good idea.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.900]  It wasn't that they were confused.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:10.020]  It was that they were like annoyed with me or something, but it was like if it's going
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:10.980]  to make them annoyed with Andrew.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.100]  It was maybe not even annoyed.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.040]  They were just confused.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.000]  I think when I don't know, I don't remember.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.680]  I just remember reading some of the comments made me look dumb.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:19.520]  Yes.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.320]  It's like this is what you guys are seeing is not actually what what we saw.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.400]  I'm not stupid.
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:26.040]  Not like everybody says.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:29.880]  I think that's the end of a great sausage talk.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:33.420]  Thank you all so much for the questions, and I don't think I have anything else to add
[01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:35.140]  in terms of sausage making.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.020]  I have one other thing that I know we're running along.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:40.840]  I apologize, but I forgot to bring it up earlier.
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:48.360]  We were talking about doing more live streaming, and I just wanted to update people sort of
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.620]  like what we've been talking about in the background of like we want to live stream
[01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:51.880]  more.
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:53.880]  Do those things live somewhere?
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:55.760]  What you know, what is this?
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.380]  How does it go?
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.040]  Like whatever.
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:05.200]  We talked about uploading them to YouTube later in unlisted and putting them in a playlist
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.780]  of like, hey, here's like all these like live streams that we did.
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.840]  Is that something that you guys want?
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:14.260]  Is that something that we should be doing?
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:21.580]  We're trying not to get slammed too algorithmically because we don't it doesn't really matter,
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.960]  but we need to like raise awareness.
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:28.140]  And when we have like these longer gameplays, like just to be very transparent, when we
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:32.740]  had a lot of fun watching Nick play Last of Us, and apparently none of you did because
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.920]  just views wise was not crushing.
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:38.400]  So it's like we still want to be able to do that.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:40.000]  And where does it go?
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.520]  I think it's less about algorithm too and more just about clutter.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.540]  You know, yeah, it's clutter.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.380]  The main, the main content is super visible.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.400]  Yeah, because it's going to be, they're going to be live streams.
[01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:52.540]  Some weeks we might do three.
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.720]  Like it might just be, you know, Andrew and Nick.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.260]  It might just be, you know, who knows?
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.500]  But like.
[01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:04.680]  We need to be aware of what we're doing and we want to make you aware of what we're trying
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:05.040]  for.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.400]  And I think unlisted playlist on YouTube might be the move, but we're not haven't really
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.960]  landed on it, landed on it yet.
[01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:15.020]  Yeah, it was the thing where we had all these different ideas of how to approach it.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.660]  And then somebody in the community suggested that as a solution.
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:20.280]  And it seemed like the perfect fix for it.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:22.120]  But I don't know how any of that stuff works.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:28.680]  So like on the surface, if you like, if I'm totally fine with what was discussed, people
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:33.560]  are saying that it doesn't doesn't really have an effect on the algorithm and discoverability
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.620]  of other videos.
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.420]  So I think it's a perfect solution.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:40.620]  And then you get all the benefits of the YouTube player without having on some weird second
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:40.940]  site.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.120]  The only hang up that I could see is that say we're doing this in a year down the road,
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:47.420]  someone wants to see.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:52.940]  One of the videos or whatever, and they go, oh, fuck, what live stream was that from?
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.100]  There's no way for it to be discoverable like you can't search for it.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.760]  It's just in an unlisted format in a playlist.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:04.120]  That's the only hiccup that I can see for like the whole thing, because I know a lot
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.560]  of people love to rewatch that stuff.
[01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:11.520]  But if that's sort of like the thing we're willing to give up, then that just might be
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:12.920]  the solution that we're looking for.
[01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:15.760]  Yeah, I think of all the options, it's the best one.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.640]  Consider it given up.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.340]  Can we even do it by like year?
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:25.380]  Can we make like like a playlist that's like VODS 2025?
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.940]  Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:28.300]  That's a really good idea.
[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:28.820]  Yeah.
[01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:29.600]  OK, good.

[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:41.080]  I think that's it.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:42.160]  No, I'm good.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.200]  It's a long one.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.000]  Geoff, do you want to wrap up this sausage?
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.200]  Yeah, I'd be happy at the end.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:53.180]  Squeeze it into its intestinal lining casing and then spin it around and say,
