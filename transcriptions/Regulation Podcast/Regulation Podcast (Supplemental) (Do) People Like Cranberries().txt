[00:00.000 --> 00:03.440]  Do people just eat cranberries like normal cranberries?
[00:03.660 --> 00:04.860]  Do people just eat the berry?
[00:05.280 --> 00:07.600]  I don't think so. No, not really.
[00:07.760 --> 00:10.080]  Because I... so there's...
[00:10.080 --> 00:13.500]  Starbucks has a new lemonade for the fall season, and I got it.
[00:13.580 --> 00:17.220]  And I have a friend who we're talking about drinking like fruit type drinks,
[00:17.240 --> 00:18.400]  and they never have the fruit.
[00:18.480 --> 00:19.860]  They never eat the fruit that's in it.
[00:19.900 --> 00:20.860]  And I thought that was weird.
[00:21.380 --> 00:22.280]  So you have to eat the fruit.
[00:23.200 --> 00:26.000]  But I've been ordering these and they have cranberry in them,
[00:26.080 --> 00:28.820]  and I've been eating it because that's... you eat the fruit.
[00:28.820 --> 00:32.200]  But it is a really unpleasant experience to the point where I just...
[00:32.200 --> 00:33.600]  I don't know. Do people eat these?
[00:33.820 --> 00:36.060]  Made me realize I've never seen anyone just eat cranberry.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.980]  Cranberries are pretty pretty tart fruit.
[00:38.080 --> 00:38.920]  Yeah, they're hot on them.
[00:39.160 --> 00:39.720]  Super tart.
[00:39.840 --> 00:41.380]  Yeah, I think they're like... they're like really like...
[00:41.380 --> 00:43.300]  They make you go like that.
[00:43.420 --> 00:44.400]  They do. Yes.
[00:44.620 --> 00:47.340]  Do I just not like cranberries or are these not for me?
[00:47.900 --> 00:50.440]  Why don't you just eat one and then be like, I don't like cranberries?
[00:50.660 --> 00:52.220]  Eating this drink wrong.
[00:52.340 --> 00:56.060]  And you keep going back to it going, guys, I got to be fucking this up.
[00:56.120 --> 00:57.340]  This has to be on me.
[00:57.340 --> 00:57.740]  Sort of.
