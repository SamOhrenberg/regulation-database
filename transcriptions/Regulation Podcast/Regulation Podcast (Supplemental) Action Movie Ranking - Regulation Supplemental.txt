[00:00.000 --> 00:05.300]  Hello and welcome to another 31 themed supplemental today.
[00:05.500 --> 00:07.900]  I am well, first of all, I'm hosting this thing.
[00:08.200 --> 00:13.080]  My name is Andrew and I am joined by Nick, Eric, Geoff and Gavin.
[00:13.300 --> 00:15.160]  How's everyone doing? Good, thanks.
[00:15.500 --> 00:17.560]  It's great. Is that why we're doing this?
[00:17.600 --> 00:18.900]  It's the 31 themed thing.
[00:19.240 --> 00:20.320]  It is 31.
[00:20.600 --> 00:22.240]  Well, listen, this is why we're doing this, OK?
[00:22.260 --> 00:25.800]  Because we've been we're hot on 31 as a number recently.
[00:25.960 --> 00:27.700]  We're doing dogs and cream.
[00:27.700 --> 00:29.160]  We did. We are.
[00:29.300 --> 00:31.900]  We did zombies that was trying to hit 31.
[00:32.820 --> 00:37.680]  And I am so sick of Christmas, of the diehard conversation of
[00:37.680 --> 00:38.980]  is it a Christmas movie?
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.620]  Is it not a Christmas movie?
[00:41.140 --> 00:43.000]  I know it's got action in, but it's not Christmas.
[00:43.220 --> 00:44.320]  I don't care about any of that.
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.380]  I'm sick of that discourse.
[00:45.620 --> 00:49.600]  So we are just going to rank action movies in December. 31 of them.
[00:49.820 --> 00:54.340]  We're going to determine what we think are the best action movies ever made.
[00:54.740 --> 00:57.220]  We are each going to submit six films.
[00:57.800 --> 00:58.920]  In a rotation.
[00:59.500 --> 01:02.380]  And then we are going to why don't we just we'll use an egg,
[01:02.500 --> 01:04.620]  but that makes 36 times five.
[01:04.760 --> 01:08.300]  So I reached out to the action movie Savant.
[01:08.680 --> 01:12.360]  Oh, yeah, PG got his opinion on what the number one should be.
[01:12.680 --> 01:15.200]  So we'll add that to the list and then it'll be 30 other ones.
[01:15.380 --> 01:19.440]  I don't think we'll have any disagreement with his contribution to the list.
[01:19.660 --> 01:22.160]  And then once we have all 31 built out, we will then,
[01:22.740 --> 01:24.920]  I guess, debate or talk amongst each other
[01:24.920 --> 01:30.100]  and try to figure out where do these place on this list from 31st to first.
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.000]  OK, so when I was originally getting my list together,
[01:35.160 --> 01:37.580]  I started picking stuff that I really liked.
[01:37.740 --> 01:40.860]  But I went like, oh, yeah, these guys probably haven't seen these,
[01:40.920 --> 01:41.920]  but I really love these movies.
[01:41.920 --> 01:43.800]  So I quickly had to redo my list,
[01:44.840 --> 01:46.680]  my entire list out the window.
[01:47.040 --> 01:48.740]  And is it because you're so cool, Eric?
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.900]  No, it's because when I I have a friend who shows me crazy Hong Kong
[01:53.900 --> 01:59.440]  action movies and stuff that came out in 1989 that like should have died
[01:59.440 --> 02:03.920]  with VHS, but he has like weird like prints of.
[02:04.140 --> 02:06.040]  Yeah. Where it's like this is called Fist Fighter.
[02:06.300 --> 02:08.480]  And I'm like, I don't think anybody's ever seen it.
[02:08.900 --> 02:11.320]  It is just blockbuster
[02:12.140 --> 02:14.480]  garbage movies that I love.
[02:14.800 --> 02:16.060]  Why don't you pick those?
[02:16.160 --> 02:16.920]  Those are your favorite.
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.660]  Because because I don't want to be 31 through 27.
[02:20.660 --> 02:21.520]  You will be.
[02:21.620 --> 02:24.540]  Come on, dude, I'm going to be 31 through 27.
[02:24.760 --> 02:26.360]  You know that I don't want to do that.
[02:26.420 --> 02:28.740]  I just I'm you get to be 26.
[02:28.880 --> 02:30.260]  You get to be 26 through 20.
[02:30.680 --> 02:34.900]  Listen, it could be it might be 26 on the list
[02:34.900 --> 02:38.700]  because it is a collective representation of us, but that it's number one
[02:38.700 --> 02:40.120]  in your heart and people will know that.
[02:40.480 --> 02:42.340]  I'm not looking for number one in my heart. I'm here to win.
[02:43.140 --> 02:43.920]  There's no winning.
[02:44.320 --> 02:45.840]  There's not any winning or losing.
[02:46.080 --> 02:46.900]  No, no, I'm going to win.
[02:47.020 --> 02:48.560]  What if we put a heart by our favorite one?
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.360]  Yeah, I mean, if I have the highest numbers, then I win.
[02:52.940 --> 02:54.120]  There's the OK.
[02:54.320 --> 02:55.820]  U.S. mindset over here, right, Gav?
[02:55.840 --> 02:58.460]  I know I know one person you're going to beat right off the jump.
[02:58.700 --> 02:59.260]  Is it Gavin?
[03:00.380 --> 03:01.340]  Let's get to it.
[03:01.620 --> 03:03.240]  Hey, let's start.
[03:03.580 --> 03:06.400]  We can go in an egg order because we're just going to make the bank
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.920]  before we go over to our ranking board.
[03:08.960 --> 03:11.600]  But what we should probably put TPG's movie first.
[03:11.700 --> 03:12.700]  I was going to say TPG.
[03:12.760 --> 03:14.600]  No surprise. Bad Boys 2.
[03:15.020 --> 03:16.060]  Course it's number one.
[03:16.060 --> 03:16.800]  Hell yeah.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.020]  All expected, it should be on this list.
[03:19.060 --> 03:20.880]  I think I have no problem with it.
[03:21.200 --> 03:22.240]  Which leads to me.
[03:22.880 --> 03:26.060]  My first contribution to this list is going to be Predator.
[03:26.400 --> 03:28.800]  One of my favorite action movies of all time.
[03:28.980 --> 03:30.340]  One of my favorite movies of all time.
[03:30.920 --> 03:32.980]  Pete Arnold fighting stuff in the jungle.
[03:33.100 --> 03:35.400]  Cool group of commandos. It's awesome.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.280]  I love I have a question. Yeah.
[03:37.720 --> 03:39.980]  Now that none of us can pick Predator, how is this not a draft?
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.580]  Because we're not drafting.
[03:41.760 --> 03:45.180]  We're just compiling a list and then as a group, we are ranking them.
[03:45.180 --> 03:48.120]  OK, there's zero draft.
[03:48.380 --> 03:50.500]  It's more like the 98 movies. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:50.980 --> 03:53.920]  But we're just making the list instead of Andrew presenting it to us.
[03:54.140 --> 03:56.300]  Exactly. There's zero drafting occurring.
[03:56.500 --> 03:58.180]  And there's no winning, I've been told.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.380]  And there is no winning.
[03:59.880 --> 04:02.000]  Uh-huh. I'm going to, but you. OK.
[04:02.200 --> 04:03.240]  We'll find out. We'll see.
[04:03.320 --> 04:05.940]  But Nick, what is your contribution to this list?
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.680]  I think it's a fairly recent one, but I'm going to go with Taken.
[04:10.800 --> 04:11.740]  A great movie.
[04:12.280 --> 04:13.220]  Damn it. Damn you.
[04:13.620 --> 04:16.920]  See, I just I like the idea of Liam Neeson being an action guy
[04:16.920 --> 04:18.840]  because that's the movie that kind of turned him into that.
[04:18.960 --> 04:20.600]  And ever since then, that's all he does.
[04:20.720 --> 04:22.800]  But before that, you know, he was just kind of a what?
[04:23.060 --> 04:25.180]  Roncom, weird show up and stuff guy.
[04:25.840 --> 04:27.580]  And I just love that movie.
[04:27.620 --> 04:30.460]  It's got some of the best, the best delivered dialogue
[04:30.460 --> 04:33.760]  about finding and killing someone and then actually doing it later.
[04:34.220 --> 04:35.320]  Yeah. Great movie.
[04:35.620 --> 04:38.520]  If you watch it and then the sequels, it makes the first one seem even better.
[04:38.860 --> 04:39.960]  Oh, yeah. Big time.
[04:41.100 --> 04:42.520]  I went through recently.
[04:42.520 --> 04:45.640]  I'm really excited for him to be in Naked Gun.
[04:45.940 --> 04:48.160]  Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's going to be awesome.
[04:48.460 --> 04:50.660]  He's so dry. It's going to be really, really funny.
[04:50.800 --> 04:53.660]  Speaking of dry, Eric, what is your first pick?
[04:54.820 --> 04:58.880]  My dry, dry pick is so dry
[04:58.880 --> 05:02.000]  because of how hot it is in that movie is heat.
[05:02.300 --> 05:05.500]  Oh, God damn this.
[05:08.040 --> 05:10.020]  I'm losing movies left and right. It's a great movie.
[05:10.020 --> 05:12.040]  It's iconic sequence.
[05:12.140 --> 05:13.060]  Almost a draft.
[05:13.980 --> 05:16.700]  Hey, hey, Geoff, you teed me up.
[05:16.760 --> 05:18.720]  I'm going to tee you up. What's your movie pick?
[05:19.300 --> 05:22.160]  When I think about a classic action movie,
[05:22.160 --> 05:25.160]  there are two things that are must haves.
[05:25.200 --> 05:26.900]  I'm not going to tell you the first yet.
[05:26.940 --> 05:29.560]  I'm going to let you figure it out based on my picks.
[05:29.780 --> 05:31.620]  But I will tell you what the second one is.
[05:31.660 --> 05:33.080]  And it's a good villain.
[05:33.300 --> 05:38.040]  And there's nobody schemier and grimier than Detroit
[05:38.560 --> 05:41.160]  industrialist Peter Delaplane, played by Craig T.
[05:41.200 --> 05:44.200]  Nelson in the 1988 Carl's weather.
[05:44.540 --> 05:47.720]  Carl Weathers helmed action flick Action Jackson.
[05:48.060 --> 05:49.740]  Nice. That's pretty cool.
[05:50.200 --> 05:52.120]  That's cool. Yeah, that was not on my list.
[05:52.440 --> 05:53.180]  It was not on my list.
[05:53.300 --> 05:56.160]  I discovered it recently when looking at Carl Weathers IMDB
[05:56.160 --> 05:57.240]  after watching Rocky.
[05:57.720 --> 05:58.980]  Great poster. Great movie.
[05:59.100 --> 06:00.480]  Saw the theater. Oh, really?
[06:00.580 --> 06:02.160]  Oh, did you really? Damn.
[06:02.420 --> 06:03.380]  That's cool. That rules.
[06:04.560 --> 06:06.960]  Gavin, if you have any movies left, it's time for your pick.
[06:08.040 --> 06:12.400]  A lovely film about a man who spends a day stuck in things that refuse to stop.
[06:12.540 --> 06:14.700]  It's Speed. Yeah, Speed was on my list.
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.540]  Great. Speed was definitely on my list.
[06:18.220 --> 06:19.940]  I'm surprised they haven't remade Speed.
[06:20.680 --> 06:22.360]  It feels like a thing they should have done by now.
[06:22.640 --> 06:23.660]  Speed 2 Cruise Control.
[06:24.060 --> 06:25.040]  Well, that's not a remake.
[06:25.280 --> 06:26.480]  Well, that's certainly not a remake.
[06:28.780 --> 06:29.600]  Speed 2.
[06:29.940 --> 06:33.200]  Unless they did like Evil Dead 2 with Speed, which is I like.
[06:33.680 --> 06:34.240]  Yeah. Premise.
[06:34.980 --> 06:36.780]  Are we doing Snake Draft?
[06:36.780 --> 06:38.220]  Or are we just going back around to the start?
[06:38.600 --> 06:39.120]  Let's do Snake.
[06:39.780 --> 06:41.280]  OK, there you go. Whatever works.
[06:41.540 --> 06:43.800]  So Gavin gets two. Gavin, what's your other one?
[06:46.480 --> 06:48.880]  Otherwise, Gavin just gets fucked over and over again.
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.480]  Apparently not prepared for this.
[06:50.780 --> 06:53.660]  I will take it's it's I wouldn't say it's all action,
[06:53.740 --> 06:57.880]  but there's certainly some very satisfying visual action in Inception.
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.960]  Oh, all right.
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.800]  Inception almost made my list.
[07:01.940 --> 07:04.720]  I think it's really. Yeah, I think that's a really good one.
[07:04.780 --> 07:05.740]  I like Inception a lot.
[07:05.740 --> 07:07.680]  My brain immediately went, well, that's near the bottom.
[07:07.900 --> 07:11.620]  This is not what I think of when I think of action, but it's a great movie.
[07:12.900 --> 07:14.260]  We're not even ranking it yet.
[07:14.340 --> 07:15.540]  And Andrew's trying to put you at the bottom.
[07:15.760 --> 07:18.380]  I just that's how it read to me.
[07:18.600 --> 07:19.900]  Do he wants you to lose this thing?
[07:20.080 --> 07:24.060]  The hallway is really maybe I'm changing, but that hallway sequence is really cool.
[07:24.080 --> 07:26.520]  Oh, yeah. I just haven't seen it in a while.
[07:27.420 --> 07:29.660]  Geoff, you have another pick.
[07:29.700 --> 07:30.440]  You start with action.
[07:30.520 --> 07:33.500]  Jackson, Jack, Jackson.
[07:34.320 --> 07:35.080]  Start with action.
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.300]  Jackson, what's next?
[07:36.560 --> 07:40.860]  If you know one thing about old Geoff, it's that Geoff is an American.
[07:41.140 --> 07:45.260]  I'm so American that I'm a United States Army veteran.
[07:45.540 --> 07:49.360]  You can't see it right now, but I'm I'm saluting an invisible flag
[07:49.360 --> 07:51.740]  because of my pride and because of my pride.
[07:51.780 --> 07:53.760]  I care about one thing.
[07:54.340 --> 07:56.780]  POWs, I want to bring those boys home.
[07:57.020 --> 08:01.180]  A lot of people think I'm talking about Rambo right now because Rambo went.
[08:01.180 --> 08:01.880]  John went out.
[08:02.020 --> 08:05.420]  He went. He went back over there and he saved those American men
[08:05.420 --> 08:06.680]  and he brought him back home.
[08:06.780 --> 08:08.280]  But he wasn't the first to do it.
[08:08.320 --> 08:11.100]  The first to do it was actually Colonel James Braddock,
[08:11.320 --> 08:14.260]  aka Chuck Norris in Missing in Action.
[08:14.720 --> 08:19.040]  Whoa. Hey, that's a that's fun.
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.120]  Geoff's picks are fun. I like this.
[08:22.120 --> 08:23.220]  This is cool.
[08:23.420 --> 08:25.640]  These this is this is great.
[08:25.820 --> 08:26.940]  This is my wheelhouse right here.
[08:27.060 --> 08:27.900]  This is fun stuff.
[08:28.420 --> 08:30.320]  I'm going to keep it easy.
[08:31.260 --> 08:35.560]  Uh, before I start getting into my deeper what who, but where do I want to put this?
[08:35.920 --> 08:38.920]  Do I want to get I want to get this on the board now
[08:39.440 --> 08:41.620]  and I'm going to go Terminator 2.
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.080]  Ooh, that's a great pick.
[08:43.420 --> 08:43.880]  Terminator.
[08:46.640 --> 08:50.840]  Terminator 2 is it definitely belongs on this list.
[08:50.960 --> 08:52.900]  And I'm going to win.
[08:53.040 --> 08:54.240]  So I feel good about this pick.
[08:56.480 --> 09:00.720]  Nick, my friends, there's a movie that has no business
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.620]  having a sequel to it, but at the time it was excellent and it's great.
[09:04.920 --> 09:07.180]  And again, I don't know why there's a sequel coming out for it,
[09:07.180 --> 09:10.080]  but it's Russell Crowe's lead gladiator.
[09:10.340 --> 09:12.080]  Good action. Great movie.
[09:12.500 --> 09:14.800]  A lot of cool action sequences, even the beginning with the
[09:14.800 --> 09:16.800]  when he's still the Roman general.
[09:17.660 --> 09:20.280]  But a lot of cool stuff that they did then in the Coliseum.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.120]  Are you going to see the new one?
[09:21.300 --> 09:22.860]  When it comes to streaming.
[09:25.140 --> 09:26.140]  So no rush.
[09:27.620 --> 09:29.700]  No, no hurry in getting the gladiator too.
[09:29.700 --> 09:31.020]  OK, good to know.
[09:31.300 --> 09:32.600]  OK, Andrew, you get to.
[09:32.940 --> 09:36.500]  I get to back to back, which is very exciting.
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.320]  I'm going to go with one that is close to my heart,
[09:40.400 --> 09:44.800]  not, I think, viewed as an iconic action movie, but I think it gets slept on.
[09:44.860 --> 09:45.700]  I think it's so much fun.
[09:46.100 --> 09:48.820]  My pick is The Rundown starring The Rock.
[09:49.100 --> 09:50.240]  I think it's his best work.
[09:50.700 --> 09:52.640]  You have Christopher Walken as a really fun villain.
[09:53.120 --> 09:57.840]  The only WWE produced film that I would ever recommend anyone see.
[09:58.520 --> 10:00.220]  Huh? Interesting.
[10:00.820 --> 10:02.000]  Really like The Rundown.
[10:02.320 --> 10:04.120]  And I'm going to follow that up. Good movie.
[10:05.240 --> 10:07.260]  With what am I going to follow it up with?
[10:07.300 --> 10:11.060]  I'm going to follow it up with a movie that probably is incredibly offensive
[10:11.060 --> 10:14.700]  to watch now, but it is an insanely fun
[10:14.700 --> 10:18.260]  action flick that I don't remember a lot of outside of constantly saying,
[10:18.380 --> 10:19.780]  this is fucking crazy.
[10:20.260 --> 10:22.940]  My pick is Crank 2 starring Jason Statham.
[10:23.180 --> 10:23.640]  Oh, wow.
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.500]  That movie's fucking nuts in a really fun way.
[10:27.840 --> 10:30.420]  Which is the crank where the nipples get cut off?
[10:30.900 --> 10:32.140]  Is that Crank 2 or 1?
[10:32.460 --> 10:33.020]  That might be two.
[10:33.100 --> 10:33.880]  I don't remember.
[10:34.100 --> 10:35.420]  I don't remember. It says a lot.
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.520]  Yeah, I remember there's a scene where they like remake the old Godzilla things,
[10:41.640 --> 10:44.760]  but with Jason Statham and he's like a paper, like a statue.
[10:44.760 --> 10:45.600]  God, that is the weirdest.
[10:46.140 --> 10:47.920]  It's a fucking crazy movie.
[10:48.400 --> 10:49.220]  Yeah. Yeah.
[10:49.500 --> 10:51.520]  Good pick. Crank 2, that's fun.
[10:53.320 --> 10:55.980]  Nick, Crank 2 is the previous pick.
[10:55.980 --> 10:58.500]  What do you have that goes on this list?
[10:58.940 --> 11:03.100]  Well, this is the movie that taught us that Colin Firth could actually be an action star.
[11:03.220 --> 11:05.020]  And that is Kingsman the Secret Service.
[11:05.360 --> 11:06.300]  Yeah, Pride and Prejudice.
[11:06.880 --> 11:07.900]  He started killing zombies.
[11:08.020 --> 11:08.420]  It was great.
[11:10.900 --> 11:12.120]  Kingsman the Secret Service
[11:12.880 --> 11:15.360]  with Taron Egerton, Edgerton, Edgerton, Edgerton?
[11:15.800 --> 11:19.400]  Another great start with some dog shit sequels.
[11:19.660 --> 11:21.000]  Yeah. Yeah.
[11:21.320 --> 11:25.100]  I was so excited for the sequels because I liked the first one so much.
[11:25.100 --> 11:26.520]  It's such a good first movie.
[11:26.820 --> 11:30.440]  Yeah. And then it was just like, yeah, what if we like fucked off?
[11:30.480 --> 11:32.120]  And it's like, oh, shit, I hadn't considered that.
[11:32.280 --> 11:33.440]  Yeah. Yeah. What if we did?
[11:33.640 --> 11:34.660]  Well, what if we just fucked off?
[11:34.700 --> 11:36.500]  And they're like, that didn't that didn't go well.
[11:36.600 --> 11:37.940]  Let's just do a prequel.
[11:38.320 --> 11:39.580]  Everybody loves prequels.
[11:39.880 --> 11:41.260]  Like, what the fuck?
[11:41.300 --> 11:41.660]  I didn't see that one.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.660]  Super weird.
[11:42.680 --> 11:43.620]  Yeah, it was OK.
[11:44.600 --> 11:44.800]  Yeah.
[11:45.080 --> 11:46.520]  I haven't seen it. It looked weird, though.
[11:46.660 --> 11:46.880]  Yeah.
[11:47.060 --> 11:51.080]  I have the next pick that goes on this, and it is something we have not picked yet.
[11:51.220 --> 11:52.600]  Andrew mentioned it in his opening.
[11:52.600 --> 11:54.980]  And for me, it will be Die Hard.
[11:55.400 --> 11:56.860]  Yeah, it goes to Die Hard.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.620]  Yeah. Great pick.
[11:58.940 --> 12:00.260]  Strong pick. Gonna win.
[12:00.660 --> 12:01.060]  Love it.
[12:01.500 --> 12:01.920]  Blood feat.
[12:02.340 --> 12:04.400]  Yeah. Well, you know, I was talking about it yesterday.
[12:04.500 --> 12:06.500]  I was in the grass and I was making fists with my toes.
[12:10.940 --> 12:12.940]  Should we see who has the strongest toe fist?
[12:14.440 --> 12:16.280]  I don't. Do you guys get a lot of foot cramps?
[12:16.880 --> 12:19.080]  No. I get a lot of foot cramps.
[12:19.480 --> 12:20.880]  I get foot cramps all the time.
[12:21.360 --> 12:23.100]  Eh, it's the worst.
[12:23.580 --> 12:25.160]  I have to put pressure on it instantly.
[12:25.560 --> 12:25.720]  Yeah, me too.
[12:25.820 --> 12:28.240]  Take like a lot of potassium to make sure it doesn't happen more.
[12:29.240 --> 12:29.260]  Yeah.
[12:29.820 --> 12:30.520]  Oh, man.
[12:30.720 --> 12:31.120]  Banana.
[12:31.700 --> 12:32.640]  Hate foot cramps.
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.200]  All right.
[12:34.380 --> 12:37.380]  Minions not making the list, but Geoff has the next pick.
[12:37.680 --> 12:38.620]  Geoff, what do you got?
[12:38.820 --> 12:39.980]  I'm going to pick a movie
[12:41.260 --> 12:46.420]  that's typically considered the 12th best film of this person's career.
[12:49.020 --> 12:50.800]  It was ahead of its time.
[12:50.800 --> 12:53.700]  When you want an action movie, you want a movie that knows what it is
[12:53.700 --> 12:56.720]  and it isn't afraid to poke a little bit of fun at itself.
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.320]  You also want not only an adventure, but something that you can plug yourself.
[13:00.340 --> 13:02.500]  You can see yourself in the titular role. Right.
[13:02.660 --> 13:06.540]  Which is why I wanted to be little Danny Madigan when I was transported
[13:06.540 --> 13:11.120]  to my favorite action film world, where Jack Slater, Arnold Schwarzenegger
[13:11.120 --> 13:13.300]  becomes my friend and helps me battle villains.
[13:13.460 --> 13:17.380]  I'm talking about Last Action Hero, 1993.
[13:17.880 --> 13:21.480]  The 12th best Arnold Schwarzenegger film ever made.
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.360]  When I was a kid, we had HBO for like three months
[13:26.360 --> 13:29.380]  and it was when Last Action Hero came to HBO.
[13:29.880 --> 13:32.540]  So I don't remember anything about this movie, but I've seen it
[13:32.540 --> 13:35.020]  probably a dozen times. I love this movie.
[13:35.400 --> 13:36.540]  Yeah, I haven't seen it.
[13:36.880 --> 13:40.000]  I just remember it looking gross and then like, isn't like Sylvester
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.800]  Stallone, the Terminator or something like that?
[13:41.880 --> 13:43.140]  It's like the funny joke.
[13:43.460 --> 13:45.500]  I have seen a GTA 4 adaption of it, though.
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.120]  From 2012.
[13:51.040 --> 13:54.120]  Gavin, you get two picks back to back.
[13:54.220 --> 13:54.880]  Remember, not a draft.
[13:55.180 --> 13:58.440]  I would say it's a it's considered a classic movie where the sequel,
[13:58.640 --> 14:00.120]  in my opinion, is much better.
[14:00.220 --> 14:02.940]  And the original is actually complete dog shit.
[14:03.100 --> 14:05.100]  I'm going with Top Gun Maverick.
[14:05.760 --> 14:06.840]  Wow. OK.
[14:06.880 --> 14:08.720]  I also don't like the first movie.
[14:09.320 --> 14:09.980]  Yeah. Oh, wow.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.820]  I was like the only kid in America who didn't like it when it came out.
[14:14.060 --> 14:14.520]  I get it.
[14:14.520 --> 14:18.580]  I don't I don't fault you for not, especially for like when it came out.
[14:18.660 --> 14:19.820]  I probably wouldn't have liked it either.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.760]  I think there's just like a lot of nostalgia and like it became a cultural
[14:23.760 --> 14:26.440]  touchstone. I don't think it's as good as the second one.
[14:26.480 --> 14:27.240]  The second one's crazy.
[14:27.580 --> 14:28.380]  Second one's awesome.
[14:28.620 --> 14:30.380]  And the practical action. Love it.
[14:30.620 --> 14:34.620]  It's so cool to see a movie that decides there are bad guys
[14:34.620 --> 14:37.800]  but won't tell you anything about them, who they are or show them in any way,
[14:37.900 --> 14:41.820]  shape or form other than guys in full body suits with gloves and masks.
[14:42.000 --> 14:43.740]  It's the best that you don't.
[14:43.740 --> 14:45.060]  There's no nation attached.
[14:45.300 --> 14:47.160]  It is for the world. It's really great.
[14:48.260 --> 14:49.760]  Gavin, you get one more choice here.
[14:50.100 --> 14:54.020]  What film has such moments as people's hands
[14:54.020 --> 14:58.120]  getting blown off or melting or big metal bastards
[14:58.120 --> 14:59.820]  struggling to get in and out of a car?
[15:00.280 --> 15:01.920]  It's Robocop.
[15:02.060 --> 15:05.080]  Sorry, Robocop was on my list.
[15:05.960 --> 15:06.460]  It's a good one.
[15:06.660 --> 15:07.740]  It's a great movie.
[15:08.220 --> 15:10.080]  Yeah, it's a lot of fun action.
[15:10.380 --> 15:11.320]  It's so bad, but good.
[15:11.320 --> 15:19.760]  Yes, it's fun in like a sarcastic way, almost like it's like a satire
[15:19.760 --> 15:22.960]  on like a lot of that stuff, but not, but it definitely is.
[15:23.060 --> 15:23.700]  And it's a blast.
[15:23.920 --> 15:24.520]  What a fun movie.
[15:24.900 --> 15:25.860]  Robocop needs his Oreos.
[15:29.140 --> 15:31.840]  That's the greatest story.
[15:32.080 --> 15:32.800]  That's so funny.
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.720]  And then it hard cuts to him, I don't want to eat my fucking Oreos.
[15:40.380 --> 15:41.180]  That's great.
[15:41.640 --> 15:43.700]  Um, Geoff, what do you got?
[15:43.880 --> 15:46.580]  When I think of action, I think of three names.
[15:46.640 --> 15:47.260]  Uh-huh.
[15:47.660 --> 15:49.460]  I think of John Travolta.
[15:49.900 --> 15:51.940]  I think of Robert Duvall.
[15:52.460 --> 15:56.040]  And I think of maybe the greatest action star of all time.
[15:56.300 --> 15:58.620]  Underrated, sure, but I think we can all agree.
[15:58.920 --> 16:00.260]  Tony Shalhoub.
[16:00.860 --> 16:04.920]  And when I think of action, yeah, I think about guns and bullets and explosions,
[16:04.920 --> 16:06.700]  but sometimes action is the best action movie of all time.
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.060]  That's why I'm picking the legal thriller based on a true story,
[16:11.300 --> 16:12.500]  A Civil Action.
[16:12.820 --> 16:14.840]  I thought you were going to tell me that there was a Monk movie.
[16:15.200 --> 16:16.280]  Deception moved to 30?
[16:16.420 --> 16:17.180]  There is a Monk movie.
[16:17.440 --> 16:19.100]  It's on Peacock, but I haven't seen it.
[16:19.200 --> 16:19.520]  Oh, shit.
[16:19.800 --> 16:20.900]  Oh, we gotta watch Monk, baby.
[16:21.040 --> 16:22.820]  It's like Mr. Monk Rides Again or something.
[16:23.700 --> 16:25.680]  Mr. Monk's last case.
[16:25.840 --> 16:26.480]  Maybe that's what it is.
[16:26.940 --> 16:27.980]  Mr. Monk's last case.
[16:28.020 --> 16:29.640]  Mr. Monk Rides Again?
[16:29.960 --> 16:32.220]  Is that like Mr. Bean-ass Idol?
[16:32.480 --> 16:34.580]  Yeah, that's such like a Pink Panther Mr. Bean.
[16:38.450 --> 16:41.050]  It's a Monk's last, Mr. Monk's last case.
[16:43.490 --> 16:47.830]  Um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do my next pick,
[16:47.830 --> 16:51.790]  and this is going to be a shout out to TPG himself
[16:52.360 --> 16:54.330]  who graced us with Bad Boys 2.
[16:55.130 --> 16:57.890]  I am picking the Michael Bay film.
[16:58.350 --> 17:00.530]  Fuck. Ambulance.
[17:00.850 --> 17:02.230]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[17:02.750 --> 17:05.090]  Spelled correctly with the L.A.
[17:05.210 --> 17:07.710]  capitalized because L.A. is a character in the film.
[17:07.710 --> 17:10.830]  Yeah, it's not a good character, but no,
[17:13.250 --> 17:14.630]  doesn't make any sense.
[17:14.650 --> 17:16.130]  But yeah, it's great.
[17:16.570 --> 17:17.850]  Ambulance, my pick.
[17:18.090 --> 17:19.210]  But next is Nick.
[17:19.490 --> 17:23.890]  There were several years there where you couldn't think of an action movie
[17:23.890 --> 17:25.990]  without one Harrison Ford.
[17:26.390 --> 17:30.110]  And there's a movie that I remember from when I was little
[17:30.110 --> 17:33.770]  that taught me a lot about one, being an action star
[17:33.770 --> 17:36.110]  and two, being the president of the United States.
[17:36.110 --> 17:40.530]  And that is Air Force One, where Harrison Ford's plane is taken over
[17:40.530 --> 17:41.990]  and he has to take it back.
[17:42.190 --> 17:43.850]  Hell yeah. Hell yeah.
[17:44.370 --> 17:45.570]  Good, memorable, phenomenal list.
[17:46.050 --> 17:47.550]  Yeah, yeah, this is great.
[17:48.250 --> 17:50.710]  We got Andrew back to back.
[17:51.910 --> 17:55.090]  You guys have me stressed out because there are certain movies
[17:55.090 --> 17:57.730]  where I feel like they can't these can't not be on the list,
[17:57.790 --> 17:58.770]  but there's more than two.
[17:59.530 --> 18:01.790]  And I'm trying to decide which two I want to go with.
[18:02.030 --> 18:03.910]  I'm going to start with.
[18:03.970 --> 18:05.310]  It just has to be on the list.
[18:05.310 --> 18:08.730]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, absolute classic commando.
[18:08.970 --> 18:13.590]  We can't have a thirty one best action movie list without commando.
[18:13.970 --> 18:16.770]  I think his most over the top, ridiculous action.
[18:16.890 --> 18:20.870]  Yeah, definitely, definitely is a great villain to great villain.
[18:21.150 --> 18:21.710]  Who's the villain?
[18:22.610 --> 18:27.290]  The guy with the mustache and the mesh shirt who actually I think the villain.
[18:27.510 --> 18:31.250]  I think that dude is the dude who wore the mask in Road Warrior.
[18:31.590 --> 18:34.190]  Look that up. Look that up and look that up and double check.
[18:34.190 --> 18:35.430]  But I think it's the same dude.
[18:35.630 --> 18:36.730]  I mean, he should have kept the mask on.
[18:37.150 --> 18:37.810]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[18:40.090 --> 18:43.330]  Yeah, his shirt looks like it's chain mail throughout most of the film,
[18:43.370 --> 18:45.190]  which is just like also a strange choice.
[18:45.690 --> 18:48.430]  It also has great little underbosses kind of throughout
[18:48.430 --> 18:50.650]  that he makes his way through like a Sega Genesis game.
[18:50.650 --> 18:53.430]  Like the dude who's like, I eat green berets for breakfast.
[18:53.690 --> 18:54.350]  Are you kidding me?
[18:54.410 --> 18:56.890]  Where that guy, he says, you promised you'd kill me last.
[18:56.990 --> 18:58.290]  And then he said, I lied.
[18:58.430 --> 18:59.690]  And then he just lets him go. That rocks.
[19:01.590 --> 19:07.470]  And then for my second pick, I am going to take none other than the Raid 2.
[19:07.610 --> 19:09.630]  And I'm just going to hope some of these films get picked.
[19:09.910 --> 19:12.490]  The Raid 2 is fucking phenomenal. So good.
[19:12.890 --> 19:16.630]  I didn't put the Raid 2 on my list because I thought TPG was going to pick it.
[19:16.910 --> 19:18.450]  It was on his top five.
[19:18.570 --> 19:20.750]  But if he had more than one pick, I think it would have been.
[19:21.130 --> 19:22.130]  Yeah, it definitely would have been.
[19:22.510 --> 19:27.050]  We only have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[19:27.130 --> 19:28.930]  Oh, my God. We're so close.
[19:28.930 --> 19:30.890]  We're so close to the end, guys.
[19:31.730 --> 19:32.710]  Nick, what do you got?
[19:32.850 --> 19:38.110]  There was a time when action movies were synonymous with one Sean Connery.
[19:38.330 --> 19:42.590]  And he came back to do one of my favorite films.
[19:42.670 --> 19:45.810]  You son of a bitch. And a Michael Bay film.
[19:45.810 --> 19:48.510]  You son of a bitch, Nick. It's The Rock.
[19:48.750 --> 19:49.250]  It is The Rock.
[19:50.910 --> 19:52.070]  Excellent action movie.
[19:52.190 --> 19:53.470]  Yep. Love it.
[19:54.350 --> 19:57.470]  Gavin and I are in such different boats where he's annoyed that you're taking it.
[19:57.470 --> 20:00.810]  And I'm just sitting here anxiously going, somebody, please pick some of these.
[20:01.010 --> 20:02.270]  Someone, please.
[20:02.610 --> 20:03.530]  You should be on the list.
[20:03.870 --> 20:05.430]  It's a draft. It's not a draft.
[20:05.990 --> 20:08.170]  Nobody's drafting. It's not a draft.
[20:08.250 --> 20:09.890]  I'm going to win, but it's not a draft.
[20:10.010 --> 20:11.670]  And I already won.
[20:11.790 --> 20:16.410]  My next pick might not be a favorite in this group.
[20:16.830 --> 20:19.950]  But if you ask your dad, it's probably his favorite.
[20:20.190 --> 20:21.430]  And that's going to be Warriors.
[20:21.710 --> 20:22.850]  That is a classic.
[20:23.410 --> 20:26.410]  That's a dad action movie all the way.
[20:26.410 --> 20:28.750]  If you put that on, dad will walk by and go, what's that?
[20:28.790 --> 20:29.430]  Oh, Warriors.
[20:29.610 --> 20:31.810]  I remember when this came out and you sit down and watch the whole thing.
[20:32.110 --> 20:34.310]  The most badass swan in all of film.
[20:34.790 --> 20:35.170]  Hell yeah.
[20:35.370 --> 20:38.870]  Also, the guy in Commando who gets held upside down and says, you kill me last.
[20:39.130 --> 20:40.850]  That's the bad guy in Warriors.
[20:41.550 --> 20:41.910]  Awesome.
[20:42.930 --> 20:44.090]  Fantastic. Fantastic.
[20:45.430 --> 20:46.470]  Geoff, what do you got?
[20:46.950 --> 20:50.850]  When I think of action, I think of a few things.
[20:51.210 --> 20:52.570]  I think of bears.
[20:53.030 --> 20:54.270]  I think of ukuleles.
[20:54.270 --> 20:56.890]  I think of stunts and explosions.
[20:56.930 --> 20:58.530]  I think of theme parks.
[20:58.730 --> 21:04.430]  I think of the year 2018 when Johnny Knoxville released Action Point,
[21:04.590 --> 21:05.590]  the instant classic.
[21:06.890 --> 21:07.750]  That's my pick.
[21:08.390 --> 21:11.030]  Action Point, the one about the amusement park?
[21:11.470 --> 21:14.070]  Yes. Which do you prefer, Point or Jackson?
[21:14.790 --> 21:16.010]  I'd probably pick Jackson.
[21:16.150 --> 21:17.270]  That's why I selected it first.
[21:17.470 --> 21:20.310]  Yeah, I think I think Action Jackson would probably be my pick above these.
[21:20.430 --> 21:21.130]  Yeah, definitely.
[21:21.410 --> 21:23.810]  But hey, but guess what, Gavin?
[21:23.810 --> 21:24.930]  You get two picks here.
[21:25.170 --> 21:29.910]  Why don't you end this round and then begin our final round
[21:29.910 --> 21:31.930]  in the action movie rancor?
[21:32.230 --> 21:34.470]  Well, I did have a I did have a Michael Bay, but it's gone.
[21:35.370 --> 21:36.830]  It was drafted away from me.
[21:36.910 --> 21:40.570]  So I'm going to go with a lovely bit of Jimmy Bond
[21:40.570 --> 21:43.350]  with probably the best action in the entire franchise.
[21:43.450 --> 21:44.930]  And that's in Casino Royale.
[21:45.210 --> 21:46.870]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[21:46.950 --> 21:48.210]  That's a good one, baby.
[21:48.730 --> 21:49.390]  That's great.
[21:49.450 --> 21:51.250]  And he walks out of the water like a sensual ape.
[21:51.250 --> 21:54.250]  It's like you got your shoulders moving.
[21:54.450 --> 21:55.390]  Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[21:55.550 --> 21:56.290]  It's a good one.
[21:56.370 --> 21:57.010]  The next one.
[21:57.330 --> 21:58.330]  Yeah, see, I'm digging it.
[21:58.370 --> 22:00.330]  I'm digging deep down my list now and I'm going to go.
[22:00.410 --> 22:02.690]  This might be a considered quite a strange pick.
[22:02.750 --> 22:03.450]  It's quite recent.
[22:03.730 --> 22:05.630]  But I did like a lot of the action in it.
[22:05.770 --> 22:08.630]  And that is the movie that couldn't decide what it was called.
[22:08.970 --> 22:09.970]  The Edge of Tomorrow.
[22:12.190 --> 22:13.530]  Oh, that's a great one.
[22:13.610 --> 22:14.930]  That is fun. Yeah. Yep.
[22:15.390 --> 22:16.930]  Are they making a sequel to that or no?
[22:17.890 --> 22:18.870]  Kind of. Maybe.
[22:18.870 --> 22:21.610]  They've been saying they will for like over a decade.
[22:21.950 --> 22:25.590]  So that's what I thought, too, is that like they just keep talking about it.
[22:25.670 --> 22:27.990]  And like, I don't know, are they like teasing us or what?
[22:28.030 --> 22:29.710]  I don't know. I hope they do.
[22:30.150 --> 22:30.850]  Yep. All right.
[22:30.950 --> 22:33.070]  Geoff, your final action pick.
[22:33.490 --> 22:34.850]  Oh, is this my sixth pick?
[22:35.150 --> 22:36.310]  It's your final pick. Yeah.
[22:36.670 --> 22:39.290]  Oh, OK. Man, where did the time go right?
[22:39.730 --> 22:42.550]  I'm going to have to whittle through and figure out what's my favorite.
[22:42.750 --> 22:43.950]  OK. Yeah. All right.
[22:44.170 --> 22:45.430]  When I think of action,
[22:46.350 --> 22:51.030]  I think of three names that are different from the previous three names I said.
[22:51.430 --> 22:54.070]  Maybe the three names that you thought were omitted.
[22:54.210 --> 22:56.930]  You might have thought to yourself, well, yeah, it's Shalhoub, of course.
[22:57.050 --> 22:58.730]  And then, yeah, then he's got Duvall.
[22:59.170 --> 23:00.030]  He's got the guns.
[23:00.150 --> 23:03.150]  Everybody knows about Duvall and, you know, his rips his chest shirt off
[23:03.150 --> 23:04.810]  and he's and he gets all fucking yoked.
[23:04.890 --> 23:06.110]  And then and then Travolta.
[23:06.290 --> 23:09.830]  But he missed Brendan Frazier, Jenna Elfman and Steve Martin,
[23:09.930 --> 23:12.950]  three of the greatest action stars in the history of our fine country.
[23:13.090 --> 23:14.950]  I'm, of course, speaking of him, by the way,
[23:14.950 --> 23:17.950]  there's been a disturbing lack of animation on this list.
[23:18.170 --> 23:20.510]  That's why I'm picking Looney Tunes back in action.
[23:22.350 --> 23:26.050]  I had no idea there were so many movies with action in the name.
[23:26.350 --> 23:28.970]  That that movie bombed so hard.
[23:29.070 --> 23:31.510]  It killed a Space Jam sequel with Tony Hawk.
[23:31.850 --> 23:33.490]  That's true. I saw that.
[23:33.550 --> 23:34.690]  I saw that TikTok.
[23:35.110 --> 23:38.210]  Yep. I saw it on theaters and really liked it as a child.
[23:39.430 --> 23:41.330]  Bummer. My final pick.
[23:41.330 --> 23:46.350]  I picked I pick all my top of the pop ones for my my my my final pick
[23:46.350 --> 23:51.270]  was going to be my number one pick when I was making my initial list.
[23:51.370 --> 23:53.230]  And it is from 1985.
[23:53.890 --> 23:57.250]  It is Michelle Yao and Cynthia Rothrock.
[23:57.810 --> 24:00.190]  Yes, Madam, a.k.a.
[24:00.310 --> 24:01.130]  Super Cops.
[24:01.890 --> 24:06.570]  It is a fucking incredible action movie
[24:06.570 --> 24:10.710]  with a final fight action sequence that is out of control.
[24:10.710 --> 24:12.890]  I love. Yes, Madam.
[24:13.090 --> 24:15.550]  It is a fantastic film that I recommend to everyone.
[24:15.550 --> 24:18.050]  But see, this is why I didn't pick all six like this.
[24:18.130 --> 24:21.630]  So there you go. Now, Nick, what is your final pick?
[24:21.850 --> 24:22.910]  Well, here's the thing.
[24:23.830 --> 24:26.910]  Sometimes an action movie needs a little bit of levity,
[24:27.030 --> 24:29.930]  a little bit of comedy, a little bit of commentary.
[24:30.270 --> 24:33.830]  And I would like to pick in this instance, Hot Fuzz.
[24:34.230 --> 24:38.990]  Oh, because one, it's hilarious action, but also at the end,
[24:38.990 --> 24:42.910]  it is one of the most action packed sequences to finish a movie.
[24:43.490 --> 24:45.570]  And I just love Timothy Dalton in that.
[24:45.770 --> 24:47.070]  It's so, so good.
[24:47.450 --> 24:48.670]  He gets a bit of Muddle Village.
[24:49.010 --> 24:50.710]  We know somebody who worked on that film, Nick.
[24:50.950 --> 24:52.850]  Really? Yeah. I'll tell you about it someday.
[24:55.150 --> 24:57.630]  Oh, if you're good, I'll tell you about it.
[24:58.070 --> 24:58.930]  Hey, thanks, man. I'll wait.
[25:00.130 --> 25:04.950]  And then finally, to finish our movie bank so we can get on to the rankings.
[25:05.310 --> 25:07.050]  Andrew, you have the final pick.
[25:07.050 --> 25:11.010]  So many classic, great action movies still to pick from.
[25:11.450 --> 25:15.770]  It's once again, it's the thing where I just can't imagine this not having a point in our list.
[25:16.030 --> 25:19.090]  So my pick is going to be none other than John Wick.
[25:19.250 --> 25:20.450]  The first John Wick.
[25:21.150 --> 25:22.770]  That was slightly further down my list.
[25:23.370 --> 25:28.670]  Great pick. Probably like the most past decade of action has been led by that.
[25:28.930 --> 25:29.450]  Well, there you go.
[25:29.630 --> 25:33.850]  I think that's a very strong list of 31 that we will be ranking here.
[25:34.690 --> 25:35.870]  Top to bottom.
[25:35.870 --> 25:39.650]  Do you guys have any honorable mentions that you want to just throw out before we get to the ranking?
[25:39.770 --> 25:40.750]  I couldn't figure out. So many.
[25:40.890 --> 25:44.230]  I wanted to get one of the Bourne movies on there, but I can't pick one.
[25:44.390 --> 25:46.170]  I would probably pick the third one. But yeah, I don't know.
[25:46.230 --> 25:47.190]  It's just a good franchise.
[25:47.590 --> 25:49.470]  There's no Mission Impossible on here.
[25:49.950 --> 25:52.470]  Yep. I was really hoping Geoff would go with Mission Impossible 3.
[25:52.590 --> 25:53.530]  I know how much he loves it.
[25:53.830 --> 25:55.990]  Oh, it's one of my favorite all time movies.
[25:56.230 --> 25:58.550]  Yeah, it was called such a great film.
[25:58.790 --> 25:59.650]  Action Impossible.
[26:01.130 --> 26:05.850]  It didn't, unfortunately, it didn't fit the criteria as I understood it.
[26:05.870 --> 26:09.450]  But yeah, I would have I would have been honored to pick it.
[26:09.670 --> 26:13.270]  I was going to the other ones that were sort of like at the top that I wanted to
[26:13.990 --> 26:16.010]  put on here were Fast 9.
[26:16.190 --> 26:17.250]  They go to space.
[26:17.310 --> 26:20.370]  And I think that's that's hard to top as far as action goes,
[26:20.650 --> 26:22.970]  especially when you see it in 4DX, you could shake it around
[26:22.970 --> 26:25.730]  and they fill the whole theater with smoke.
[26:26.050 --> 26:28.830]  And it's crazy. It's very, very cool.
[26:29.470 --> 26:31.770]  Snake Eyes was another one I was going to put on here.
[26:32.030 --> 26:33.370]  Classic. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:33.370 --> 26:35.390]  But we got to watch it. You know what I mean?
[26:35.390 --> 26:38.390]  You guys need to experience it so that way you can really understand
[26:38.910 --> 26:40.310]  what's so impressive about it.
[26:40.910 --> 26:44.150]  I was I was on the fence about this one, and I was wondering
[26:44.150 --> 26:46.510]  if this was maybe on any of your backup lists as well.
[26:46.710 --> 26:50.450]  The 1943 Humphrey Bogart classic action in the North Atlantic.
[26:50.630 --> 26:52.210]  Were any of you guys considering that?
[26:53.030 --> 26:56.170]  You know, it crossed my mind, but I didn't think Gavin was going to.
[26:56.230 --> 26:57.410]  And that's why I didn't put it on mine.
[26:57.590 --> 26:59.050]  I was I was. Yes. OK.
[27:02.090 --> 27:06.490]  How about the Burt Lancaster films with Robert Ryan and Will Greer?
[27:07.570 --> 27:09.470]  Executive action about JFK?
[27:09.770 --> 27:11.430]  No, no, no, it's not mine either.
[27:11.570 --> 27:12.970]  Oh, I'll miss that one.
[27:13.110 --> 27:16.630]  I almost went for Rush Hour, but yeah, that's a good one.
[27:16.690 --> 27:17.350]  Those are really good one.
[27:17.550 --> 27:20.330]  I thought about Blade. Yeah, I was on my list.
[27:20.670 --> 27:22.230]  Mm hmm. I had
[27:23.430 --> 27:27.190]  Ong back on my list, which it was really difficult for me to not include,
[27:27.310 --> 27:28.750]  but great action movie.
[27:29.310 --> 27:33.930]  As well as the Equalizer three, which does something very specific for action.
[27:35.250 --> 27:36.790]  Equilibrium. That's a good one.
[27:37.090 --> 27:38.890]  I had that on my list. Yeah. Classic.
[27:39.290 --> 27:41.050]  A lot of good action movies. So many.
[27:41.310 --> 27:42.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[27:42.290 --> 27:45.970]  I was going to go with Lady Terminator and parole violators.
[27:46.510 --> 27:49.990]  Ooh, parole violators has a really great line near the end
[27:49.990 --> 27:53.670]  where a guy says you're under arrest for violating parole
[27:53.670 --> 27:56.770]  and then shoots a guy at point blank range in the throat.
[27:56.770 --> 28:01.310]  So it is so funny.
[28:01.690 --> 28:02.610]  It's so funny.
[28:02.750 --> 28:04.890]  But that's what my list was going to be comprised of that stuff.
[28:04.970 --> 28:06.690]  But now we got to rank guys.
[28:06.830 --> 28:08.190]  I don't know if we start top to bottom.
[28:08.290 --> 28:10.370]  We start throwing stuff in places.
[28:10.550 --> 28:12.130]  How do you want to go about this?
[28:12.350 --> 28:15.430]  Well, let's just it's in my experience of doing this type of thing.
[28:15.670 --> 28:18.290]  It's easy to like make tears and then make groups
[28:18.290 --> 28:20.310]  and then fight within the placement of those tears.
[28:20.630 --> 28:25.290]  OK, I mean, I can put them off to the side is like a temp hold place.
[28:25.290 --> 28:28.070]  I think bad boys, too, is going to be in the top 10.
[28:28.390 --> 28:30.550]  I think that's something we all would probably agree on.
[28:30.710 --> 28:32.410]  I think bad boys, too, would go in the top 10.
[28:32.950 --> 28:35.290]  Sure. We all feel bad boys, too, in the top 10.
[28:35.550 --> 28:38.870]  Yes, sure. OK, I think I'm just listing it here.
[28:38.970 --> 28:41.210]  Like I can put it in the actual list.
[28:42.490 --> 28:44.870]  Yeah. Why don't you just put it at five to start and then we can.
[28:45.010 --> 28:45.930]  You got it. OK, sure.
[28:46.670 --> 28:49.550]  OK, with that bad boys, too, is on the list.
[28:50.730 --> 28:51.790]  Hang on. How do I do?
[28:51.910 --> 28:53.750]  What's like the cool little button to do?
[28:53.750 --> 28:54.650]  Strike through.
[28:54.910 --> 28:57.990]  Well, he does that. Is there any other anything?
[28:58.190 --> 29:00.410]  Jump out to people of like, think it'll be in the top 10?
[29:00.830 --> 29:03.570]  Yep. I think.
[29:04.510 --> 29:06.190]  I think Terminator two is in the.
[29:06.350 --> 29:08.150]  Yeah, yeah, I would agree. Yeah, I'd agree.
[29:08.450 --> 29:09.850]  OK, I'm fine with that.
[29:10.510 --> 29:13.690]  Uh, OK. I didn't put aliens on shit.
[29:14.770 --> 29:15.710]  Aliens is on my list.
[29:15.910 --> 29:17.210]  A lot of good stuff got missed.
[29:17.690 --> 29:19.550]  I think Die Hard is top 10.
[29:20.070 --> 29:21.650]  I would. Yeah, I would agree.
[29:21.830 --> 29:22.690]  I would ultimately agree.
[29:22.690 --> 29:24.630]  I did the thing where I made a note on my phone
[29:24.630 --> 29:27.950]  and it bolded the top thing I wrote, which was aliens.
[29:28.110 --> 29:30.210]  And then I just ignored it because it looked like the title.
[29:33.730 --> 29:35.010]  Let's see what else is on this.
[29:36.670 --> 29:37.790]  Gladiator? Top 10?
[29:37.950 --> 29:40.750]  I would put it at the bottom half of the top 10 if it was going to be 10.
[29:40.970 --> 29:42.790]  If it's going into the top 10, I would put it at 10.
[29:43.030 --> 29:43.670]  I think that's high.
[29:43.870 --> 29:45.070]  I'm not a huge Gladiator fan.
[29:45.170 --> 29:46.390]  I like it. I don't love it.
[29:46.450 --> 29:48.050]  I think Heat is in the top 10.
[29:48.690 --> 29:49.770]  Heat's a good movie in the top 10.
[29:49.850 --> 29:51.350]  Heat's good. Heat's a good movie. I'd put it at 7.
[29:51.350 --> 29:53.190]  Where do you guys think Predator would go?
[29:53.690 --> 29:56.150]  A top 10. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, just making sure.
[29:56.350 --> 29:57.810]  OK, I'm glad. Do you guys all agree with that?
[29:58.310 --> 29:59.930]  Yeah, I certainly do. Yeah.
[30:01.230 --> 30:02.230]  Andrew wants to win.
[30:02.930 --> 30:03.570]  There's no winning.
[30:03.830 --> 30:06.730]  I just was worried that I like Predator way more than anyone else here.
[30:06.810 --> 30:09.530]  So seeing the enthusiasm around it, I like.
[30:09.650 --> 30:11.210]  Dude, come on. It's fucking Predator.
[30:11.690 --> 30:16.210]  I could see Robocop going pretty high, or honestly,
[30:16.210 --> 30:18.430]  I could see The Rock going pretty high. Yeah.
[30:18.430 --> 30:21.410]  I haven't seen it, but like I know the love around it.
[30:21.490 --> 30:24.270]  I wouldn't argue that. I have no problem with it in top 10.
[30:24.510 --> 30:27.090]  Do you think if it's a top 10, do you think it goes at like nine
[30:27.090 --> 30:28.210]  or do you think it goes higher?
[30:29.150 --> 30:30.810]  That'll be for you guys. Geoff, what do you think?
[30:31.110 --> 30:32.530]  I'd say nine is appropriate.
[30:32.890 --> 30:34.550]  Geoff made a grunt, so I want to know what he thought.
[30:34.670 --> 30:35.970]  What do you think, Gavin? For The Rock?
[30:36.310 --> 30:38.530]  Yeah. Nine or ten. OK. Yeah, I think so.
[30:38.590 --> 30:42.110]  I think just looking at the list that we have here and like where it stacks,
[30:42.190 --> 30:43.870]  like Casino Royale, I could easily put it eight.
[30:44.150 --> 30:46.770]  I think I could probably put Casino Royale probably like a little bit higher.
[30:46.890 --> 30:47.950]  I love Casino Royale.
[30:47.950 --> 30:49.490]  Yeah, I could see that at eight.
[30:49.750 --> 30:53.970]  Although it does have like 45 minutes of playing cards.
[30:54.110 --> 30:55.750]  It does. But I love that. Yeah.
[30:55.830 --> 30:59.090]  But it's so exciting. Yeah, it's it's very exciting.
[30:59.870 --> 31:02.790]  Anything else on here that jumps out to you guys that should be top 10?
[31:02.910 --> 31:04.070]  Top Gun Maverick, maybe?
[31:04.490 --> 31:05.510]  I don't think that's a top 10.
[31:05.610 --> 31:07.910]  I don't think that's a top 10. That movie's pretty fucking cool.
[31:08.290 --> 31:09.330]  It is pretty fucking cool.
[31:09.690 --> 31:11.730]  I mean, I would probably have Robocop up there.
[31:11.970 --> 31:15.930]  I would put Robocop in the top 10, probably like around like that
[31:15.930 --> 31:18.970]  seven through 10 slot, maybe, or even like maybe like a little bit higher
[31:18.970 --> 31:21.490]  in like that midsection. Put it at one or two. Sure.
[31:22.310 --> 31:23.190]  This is so hard.
[31:24.790 --> 31:27.590]  We'll start moving. We'll start moving them around once we get into it.
[31:27.750 --> 31:30.610]  Yeah. Yeah. Just make sure you don't leave that there. Yeah.
[31:31.290 --> 31:35.330]  Yeah. Let's see what else could go in this top 10 that we feel
[31:35.330 --> 31:36.630]  that we would feel good about.
[31:37.850 --> 31:40.310]  Speed, I could see as a top 10 movie.
[31:40.930 --> 31:44.170]  I mean, I love that movie, but I don't see it as a top 10 action movie.
[31:44.170 --> 31:48.050]  OK. And that bus does jump that gap from nothing.
[31:48.370 --> 31:51.590]  Is it maybe do we pivot now and like put stuff at the bottom
[31:51.590 --> 31:53.850]  and just like start whittling that way?
[31:54.230 --> 31:55.310]  I feel like it's real. Yeah.
[31:55.350 --> 31:56.470]  What do you guys want to start putting at the bottom?
[31:57.330 --> 32:00.590]  Ooh, let's see. Mm hmm.
[32:04.870 --> 32:09.270]  I've never I've never you know, I've never seen Raid two.
[32:09.590 --> 32:11.310]  So maybe put that at thirty one.
[32:11.630 --> 32:13.870]  No, I think Raid two is probably it's probably going to be
[32:13.870 --> 32:15.870]  like this up. It's probably pretty high.
[32:15.970 --> 32:19.210]  It should probably be top five, but I'm not going to argue that
[32:19.210 --> 32:21.190]  because I don't think we'll put it at number one in it.
[32:21.610 --> 32:22.550]  No, I don't think it needs to be.
[32:22.690 --> 32:24.450]  No, I don't think it needs to be one.
[32:24.890 --> 32:27.670]  Put it at number five and put Bad Boys two at number one.
[32:27.990 --> 32:31.710]  How about how about we put Looney Tunes back in action at thirty one?
[32:31.770 --> 32:33.190]  I'm someone who loves that movie.
[32:33.470 --> 32:37.050]  Uh-huh. Would not think of it as like a great action movie.
[32:37.310 --> 32:39.210]  I mean, it's in the name. I got a problem with that.
[32:39.490 --> 32:42.470]  I mean, I'm fine with it is in the name.
[32:42.470 --> 32:48.650]  Kind of super literal and more so than all but five other choices on this whole list.
[32:49.350 --> 32:51.950]  I would argue that there are six that stand out
[32:51.950 --> 32:55.290]  as probably the top six action films of all time.
[32:57.690 --> 32:59.890]  But I'd be willing to put Air Force one at 30.
[33:02.150 --> 33:02.930]  All right.
[33:03.930 --> 33:08.130]  Honestly, if I'm looking at movies that might go at 30,
[33:08.290 --> 33:10.490]  I'm thinking civil action.
[33:10.490 --> 33:12.630]  I, you know, I haven't seen it.
[33:12.690 --> 33:15.430]  Once again, I think it's odd that the name action is in it
[33:15.430 --> 33:17.170]  and it's somehow at the bottom of the action list.
[33:17.250 --> 33:18.790]  But if you want to put it at 30, go ahead.
[33:19.050 --> 33:21.470]  We got to start somewhere. Yeah, right. Yeah. Great.
[33:21.790 --> 33:25.030]  I think a civil action probably just hang out down here for a while.
[33:25.390 --> 33:27.710]  I mean, who knows? Maybe it bumps up. Maybe it goes to 29.
[33:28.170 --> 33:30.410]  Maybe we do the rundown at 29.
[33:30.910 --> 33:34.150]  I think the rundown could be like, yeah, I think the rundown could be like 23.
[33:34.570 --> 33:36.010]  It's yeah. Like, I'm fine with that.
[33:36.170 --> 33:39.170]  Like, that's no get out of here. Air Force one.
[33:39.170 --> 33:40.590]  Rundown is better than Air Force one.
[33:40.710 --> 33:41.530]  Way better than the rundown.
[33:41.530 --> 33:42.550]  Oh, it's not. Jesus Christ.
[33:42.690 --> 33:43.970]  No, it's not. It's getting heated.
[33:44.250 --> 33:48.830]  Now, if it helps, I do think Air Force one either goes in at 24 or 22.
[33:49.370 --> 33:51.250]  Air Force one is below the rundown.
[33:51.570 --> 33:52.850]  They are. No, it's above.
[33:52.990 --> 33:55.790]  Those are those are not even Harrison Ford's best action.
[33:55.930 --> 33:57.810]  It's one of the better ones.
[33:57.870 --> 33:58.810]  What's his best action, Andrew?
[33:59.590 --> 34:01.350]  Six days, seven nights. Clearly.
[34:01.890 --> 34:03.110]  All right. Well, I would have picked any.
[34:03.310 --> 34:05.910]  I would have picked any number of Indiana Jones movies over that.
[34:06.030 --> 34:07.890]  But yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[34:08.450 --> 34:09.590]  Or when he was Jack Ryan.
[34:09.770 --> 34:10.570]  Some of all fears.
[34:10.790 --> 34:12.210]  No, he's not Jack Ryan in that one.
[34:12.290 --> 34:13.650]  That's Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan.
[34:13.770 --> 34:15.930]  Any thoughts on like, where do you think Taken lives?
[34:16.350 --> 34:19.490]  Fourteen? Yeah, Taken is like in the 15, 20.
[34:20.190 --> 34:21.330]  I put Taken. That sounds good.
[34:21.650 --> 34:22.770]  Pretty close to John Wick.
[34:22.930 --> 34:24.690]  Oh, I think John Wick is number 15.
[34:24.790 --> 34:25.970]  I think John Wick is dead center.
[34:26.330 --> 34:30.050]  I think Taken has to be right above John Wick wherever they are on the list.
[34:30.570 --> 34:33.870]  Yeah, I think those are I think that's that's like a
[34:34.530 --> 34:38.750]  like one in one a type situation like where that's those are both.
[34:38.870 --> 34:41.850]  Yeah, they they shaded so much of what happens in action.
[34:42.010 --> 34:46.450]  And it's like I didn't necessarily care for either one of those movies very much.
[34:46.670 --> 34:48.830]  I'm not going to argue because it's like doesn't really matter.
[34:49.370 --> 34:53.650]  The only movie on this list that I actively did not enjoy is Action Point.
[34:53.870 --> 34:55.130]  I really wanted to like it.
[34:55.170 --> 34:56.970]  I love it. Put it at 29.
[34:57.230 --> 34:58.870]  You think you think Action Point probably at 29?
[34:59.010 --> 35:00.170]  OK, yeah, I think that's fair.
[35:00.170 --> 35:01.370]  What didn't you like about it?
[35:01.450 --> 35:03.930]  The the weird mixed genre of it?
[35:04.210 --> 35:06.110]  It just it wasn't fun.
[35:06.230 --> 35:08.450]  You understand the name action is in the title, though.
[35:08.750 --> 35:10.010]  I do. Yeah. OK.
[35:11.230 --> 35:14.390]  I absolutely have to acknowledge that does have action in the title.
[35:14.670 --> 35:17.090]  It's even the first word in the title,
[35:19.450 --> 35:22.150]  which some would argue would make it number one on this list.
[35:23.490 --> 35:24.930]  Is the only one.
[35:25.450 --> 35:27.010]  No, Action Jackson's here, too, man.
[35:27.430 --> 35:28.590]  That's true. One or two.
[35:28.590 --> 35:30.250]  That's a strong one and two.
[35:30.430 --> 35:31.190]  You mean number 28?
[35:31.490 --> 35:32.930]  Action Jackson's way better than number 28.
[35:33.290 --> 35:34.590]  Action Jackson is much better.
[35:34.710 --> 35:37.970]  Action Jackson and Missing in Action are both better than number 28.
[35:38.390 --> 35:39.870]  I think you're like 21 and 22, maybe.
[35:40.070 --> 35:40.710]  Yeah, probably.
[35:40.930 --> 35:42.150]  Sure. That's that's totally fine.
[35:42.290 --> 35:44.550]  Action Jackson above Air Force One.
[35:44.630 --> 35:46.170]  Now, here's the thing.
[35:46.670 --> 35:50.990]  If I were to put them, I would put Action Jackson and Missing in Action
[35:50.990 --> 35:53.290]  both above the rundown and Air Force One.
[35:53.550 --> 35:54.710]  Yes, I agree. I agree.
[35:54.710 --> 35:58.830]  Without without any comment, I genuinely, honestly agree.
[35:58.910 --> 36:00.430]  Having seen both 100 percent.
[36:00.590 --> 36:02.710]  Yes. Having probably one of only two people in the room
[36:02.710 --> 36:04.350]  that's actually seen them, I would agree.
[36:04.510 --> 36:08.930]  Action Jackson, Missing in Action, fun ass, like exactly what you want
[36:08.930 --> 36:10.170]  out of them movies.
[36:10.430 --> 36:13.970]  The rundown was at came out at a time
[36:13.970 --> 36:17.790]  where everyone had the worst haircuts and movies look like shit.
[36:18.190 --> 36:20.230]  And it's hard to look at.
[36:20.330 --> 36:22.130]  I don't like looking at the rundown.
[36:22.210 --> 36:23.230]  I strongly disagree.
[36:23.230 --> 36:27.670]  They do this thing to Chuck Norris when he's trying to save the POWs.
[36:27.730 --> 36:29.350]  They string him up upside down.
[36:29.430 --> 36:30.810]  They tie his hands behind him.
[36:30.930 --> 36:32.610]  So he's hanging upside down by his feet.
[36:32.830 --> 36:35.350]  And they take a rag and they put or not a rag.
[36:35.390 --> 36:36.850]  I'm sorry, a bag like a burlap sack.
[36:36.910 --> 36:39.130]  And they put a rat in it like a giant angry rat.
[36:39.210 --> 36:40.430]  And they tie it around his head.
[36:40.450 --> 36:42.490]  And the rat's supposed to eat his brains out or whatever.
[36:42.710 --> 36:44.990]  And he like fucking rides around for a while.
[36:45.170 --> 36:47.730]  And then he said, then he's still and blood pours out.
[36:47.770 --> 36:49.010]  And they're like, oh, the rat got him.
[36:49.210 --> 36:49.810]  And they pull it out.
[36:49.830 --> 36:51.770]  And he's just got the fucking dead rat in his mouth.
[36:52.270 --> 36:52.730]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:52.730 --> 36:56.810]  It's so I'm going to I'm going to drop this photo in the chat real quick
[36:57.350 --> 36:58.450]  so you guys can see it.
[36:58.710 --> 37:00.510]  It's so fucking bloody.
[37:00.610 --> 37:02.670]  It rocks. Oh, yeah, there it is.
[37:03.030 --> 37:07.870]  It's so there's so much blood inside that rat.
[37:07.990 --> 37:09.890]  It goes everywhere.
[37:11.070 --> 37:13.330]  It's it's so oh my God.
[37:13.410 --> 37:15.250]  It's so awesome. It's so cool.
[37:15.390 --> 37:16.770]  So twenty twenty one, twenty two.
[37:17.710 --> 37:19.030]  I would put them right there.
[37:19.030 --> 37:22.930]  I think I think Action Jackson and Missing in Action
[37:22.930 --> 37:25.550]  are like right around the 20 spot.
[37:25.670 --> 37:26.730]  Sure. That's three.
[37:27.170 --> 37:29.610]  I'm going to put Missing in Action above Action Jackson.
[37:30.170 --> 37:32.250]  That's fine. Yeah, I think. Yeah, sure.
[37:32.750 --> 37:34.570]  Chuck Norris did spawn all those memes and whatnot.
[37:35.010 --> 37:37.130]  Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's that's why I did that. Yeah.
[37:39.850 --> 37:42.950]  I think in let's talk about Inception.
[37:43.270 --> 37:44.990]  Oh, where does that go?
[37:45.230 --> 37:48.330]  That's really tough, because like as a movie, I'd put it a lot higher
[37:48.330 --> 37:50.330]  than I would as an action movie.
[37:50.970 --> 37:52.050]  Thinking like 16.
[37:52.290 --> 37:53.650]  It's not ahead of John Wick.
[37:53.930 --> 37:54.870]  I think it's like 12.
[37:55.290 --> 37:56.030]  Oh, I disagree.
[37:56.350 --> 37:58.270]  I don't think it's above Taken or John Wick.
[37:59.450 --> 38:01.710]  You don't think it's above Taken and John Wick or you do?
[38:01.870 --> 38:02.550]  No, I think it's.
[38:02.670 --> 38:05.030]  Yeah, I think 16, 17 is where it feels to me.
[38:05.290 --> 38:08.110]  OK, yeah. 17, I think it's on the strength of how good the movie is.
[38:08.150 --> 38:10.850]  But the on just from an action stand, it doesn't have action.
[38:10.950 --> 38:11.830]  The title, first of all.
[38:13.790 --> 38:14.890]  What about speed?
[38:15.310 --> 38:17.650]  I was just thinking speed is weird.
[38:17.650 --> 38:19.770]  It's definitely above Inception.
[38:20.410 --> 38:22.650]  Yeah, and it doesn't have action in the title.
[38:22.790 --> 38:23.450]  Here's a question.
[38:24.370 --> 38:26.710]  Is speed better than John Wick?
[38:27.030 --> 38:28.890]  Yes. Keanu versus Keanu.
[38:29.490 --> 38:32.590]  Speed is so much better than John Wick.
[38:32.830 --> 38:35.410]  It's like they're not like they're not close.
[38:35.710 --> 38:37.410]  Then it goes higher than 15.
[38:37.770 --> 38:39.270]  Yeah, it goes way higher than 15.
[38:39.450 --> 38:40.550]  Maybe put it at 13.
[38:40.730 --> 38:41.670]  It's definitely not top 10.
[38:41.850 --> 38:42.430]  It's tough.
[38:42.810 --> 38:45.910]  I, I think it I think it could be above John Wick.
[38:45.910 --> 38:48.030]  I think it's definitely above John Wick.
[38:48.430 --> 38:52.690]  You spend the whole movie with the bus and you expect it to eventually blow up and hit something.
[38:52.950 --> 38:53.890]  It hits a plane.
[38:54.230 --> 38:54.430]  Yeah.
[38:54.930 --> 38:56.090]  He's under the bus.
[38:56.210 --> 38:57.550]  They're jumping on and off the bus.
[38:57.910 --> 38:59.050]  They do a lot.
[38:59.170 --> 39:00.470]  They make a lot out of the bus.
[39:00.630 --> 39:01.910]  You got to give a deal for that.
[39:02.210 --> 39:02.950]  Also, absolutely.
[39:03.410 --> 39:05.370]  The bus stuff happens pretty quick.
[39:05.550 --> 39:08.670]  They're doing a lot of stuff not on the bus at the beginning of the movie, guys.
[39:09.010 --> 39:10.910]  There's a lot of action at the beginning of that film.
[39:11.190 --> 39:11.810]  On the train.
[39:12.290 --> 39:13.730]  There's so much going on.
[39:13.730 --> 39:20.230]  John Wick, though, it's it's all about extreme pain visited on bad people that are bad to
[39:20.230 --> 39:20.590]  pets.
[39:20.710 --> 39:21.570]  That's true.
[39:21.610 --> 39:22.350]  Which is pretty cool.
[39:22.650 --> 39:27.250]  See, where it's complicated for me is I feel like speed is probably above Taken, but not
[39:27.250 --> 39:29.590]  above John Wick, which is the way we disagree.
[39:30.250 --> 39:33.170]  I don't think you're nuts.
[39:33.590 --> 39:34.630]  I think John Wick.
[39:35.090 --> 39:37.430]  I think it's so much better than both of those movies.
[39:37.570 --> 39:40.730]  Honestly, I think Taken and John Wick are too high on this list, but I'm not going to fight
[39:40.730 --> 39:41.110]  for it.
[39:41.290 --> 39:42.010]  I think you're wrong.
[39:42.010 --> 39:42.750]  They're so cool.
[39:42.870 --> 39:44.010]  Both of them are so cool.
[39:44.170 --> 39:46.070]  I think Taken and John Wick are like 19 and 20.
[39:46.510 --> 39:46.810]  Take it.
[39:46.890 --> 39:48.190]  He shoots someone in the back.
[39:48.250 --> 39:49.270]  He shoots someone's wife.
[39:49.610 --> 39:50.850]  He shot everybody's wife.
[39:51.250 --> 39:53.750]  Such a fucking tough moment, man.
[39:54.050 --> 39:55.530]  I think Taken's a better film.
[39:55.710 --> 39:58.090]  I do think speed is more fun than Taken.
[39:58.510 --> 39:59.790]  Like it might be easier to sit down and watch.
[39:59.790 --> 40:00.570]  That I would agree with.
[40:01.010 --> 40:04.570]  Speed is a movie where if you just if you're walking through the room, your head just keeps
[40:04.570 --> 40:06.650]  looking and then you've been stood there for like eight minutes.
[40:07.070 --> 40:07.230]  Yeah.
[40:07.230 --> 40:12.790]  What I love so much about John Wick is it's about the existential dread of the people
[40:12.790 --> 40:18.730]  in universe understand that this is an action star, essentially, and that they have unleashed
[40:18.730 --> 40:19.750]  him upon themselves.
[40:20.270 --> 40:21.750]  I think that's so fun.
[40:22.350 --> 40:22.530]  Yeah.
[40:22.650 --> 40:25.930]  Like there's a level of awareness of like, oh, what you've did this.
[40:26.030 --> 40:27.890]  This isn't this is a cartoonish killer.
[40:28.190 --> 40:31.410]  This is a force of nature that we cannot stop.
[40:31.510 --> 40:31.790]  We're fine.
[40:31.850 --> 40:34.570]  And and it spawned a larger franchise than speed.
[40:34.850 --> 40:35.050]  Yeah.
[40:35.470 --> 40:35.750]  Yeah.
[40:35.750 --> 40:37.310]  Is that how we're judging these?
[40:37.430 --> 40:38.350]  No, like I don't.
[40:38.470 --> 40:40.170]  That doesn't add a lot to me personally.
[40:40.190 --> 40:41.690]  That doesn't think that doesn't do shit.
[40:41.790 --> 40:43.150]  Honestly, I think that takes away.
[40:43.430 --> 40:44.550]  I don't think it takes away.
[40:44.710 --> 40:46.290]  I think that I don't think that takes away at all.
[40:46.370 --> 40:50.950]  But if it creates a whole universe, if that's if it creates a whole universe that people
[40:50.950 --> 40:53.290]  want to play in for years to come, I don't see how that's a bad.
[40:53.570 --> 40:57.830]  The world building is really because everything that most of these movies and the things that
[40:57.830 --> 41:02.190]  spawn off of them are not worth like there's a reason that Terminator three isn't on this
[41:02.190 --> 41:02.570]  list.
[41:02.570 --> 41:06.490]  Yeah, Terminator two and bad boys two are both in the top five right now.
[41:06.590 --> 41:06.810]  Right.
[41:06.850 --> 41:07.350]  Both sequels.
[41:07.610 --> 41:07.950]  They are.
[41:07.970 --> 41:09.750]  And they're and they're not higher.
[41:09.850 --> 41:12.070]  And Terminator one, I think, could be on this list.
[41:12.190 --> 41:13.070]  But I mean, I don't.
[41:13.390 --> 41:18.810]  But I don't think that the sequel spawning thing is criteria for what what is worth time.
[41:18.990 --> 41:20.590]  Let me try to thread this needle a little bit.
[41:20.650 --> 41:24.990]  I think, Geoff, you're so right that I think the world building in John Wick is super cool.
[41:25.210 --> 41:28.010]  And I think it's it's it shows how impactful that was.
[41:28.550 --> 41:31.270]  I also think that because they're sequels, it doesn't necessarily make it better.
[41:31.270 --> 41:32.710]  I'm not saying it makes it better.
[41:32.870 --> 41:36.270]  I'm just saying that that you have to take into account that when they create such a rich
[41:36.270 --> 41:40.530]  world that people get to play in it for years to come, that's because the movie makes such
[41:40.530 --> 41:41.350]  a big impact.
[41:41.610 --> 41:42.350]  Yeah, that's fair.
[41:42.690 --> 41:43.550]  But I wouldn't.
[41:43.610 --> 41:48.610]  The rock didn't make an impact in the way that that John Wick did clearly or there would
[41:48.610 --> 41:49.350]  have been a rock to.
[41:49.590 --> 41:51.950]  Well, it's like also like creative intent.
[41:52.550 --> 41:57.990]  There was no, I think, desire to make a rock to maybe where John Wick leads to like a definite
[41:58.730 --> 41:59.130]  sequels.
[41:59.130 --> 42:03.050]  One of the most direct sequels of doesn't John Wick to literally start where John Wick
[42:03.050 --> 42:03.630]  one ends?
[42:04.250 --> 42:06.390]  Like, I think it's beat for beat into the next.
[42:06.770 --> 42:07.030]  I don't know.
[42:07.050 --> 42:07.670]  I never saw John Wick.
[42:07.850 --> 42:07.870]  Yeah.
[42:07.970 --> 42:08.890]  I only saw the first one.
[42:08.990 --> 42:09.470]  You are right.
[42:15.800 --> 42:17.600]  John Wick 2 is definitely better than Speed 2.
[42:18.120 --> 42:20.060]  The funniest thing you could have said right there.
[42:21.100 --> 42:22.000]  I don't fucking know.
[42:22.000 --> 42:22.720]  I didn't watch that shit.
[42:25.060 --> 42:31.840]  I just I just I failed to see why a movie spawning sequels is a bad thing to be on this list.
[42:31.840 --> 42:32.800]  Not a bad thing.
[42:32.920 --> 42:33.980]  I just don't think that's insane.
[42:34.060 --> 42:35.200]  That's an insanity to me.
[42:35.260 --> 42:35.860]  Oh, man.
[42:36.020 --> 42:40.820]  It's because it's like not just within the art like there's financial motivations and
[42:40.820 --> 42:44.260]  then you can, I guess, make an argument that it was financially successful because it connected
[42:44.260 --> 42:44.660]  with people.
[42:44.780 --> 42:45.840]  But it just gets money.
[42:46.260 --> 42:47.880]  I didn't see that one.
[42:51.460 --> 42:52.420]  Hot fuzz.
[42:54.360 --> 43:00.200]  Hot fuzz is weird because it's it's about it's about other action movies largely.
[43:00.200 --> 43:01.740]  Bad Boys 2, isn't it?
[43:01.800 --> 43:03.420]  It's 45 minutes too long.
[43:03.780 --> 43:06.300]  I don't like this movie at all.
[43:06.640 --> 43:07.740]  Oh, well, you're crazy.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.500]  What don't you like about it?
[43:09.700 --> 43:09.840]  Yeah.
[43:11.120 --> 43:12.940]  Uh, nothing was grabbing me.
[43:13.060 --> 43:16.740]  And the whole time I was going, well, I bet this was probably like a lot of fun to make.
[43:16.820 --> 43:20.260]  And that that didn't really that didn't really draw me in.
[43:22.040 --> 43:23.340]  It just it just wasn't.
[43:23.400 --> 43:25.160]  I think it was just a movie that wasn't for me.
[43:25.420 --> 43:26.340]  I think that's it.
[43:26.380 --> 43:26.460]  Yeah.
[43:26.460 --> 43:28.380]  How do you feel about whodunits generally?
[43:30.860 --> 43:31.580]  I don't.
[43:31.660 --> 43:32.500]  I'm fine with them.
[43:32.780 --> 43:36.480]  I just think like the action I thought was like medium action.
[43:36.620 --> 43:40.260]  And then they're like, now this is the part of the movie where we're going to do an action
[43:40.260 --> 43:40.580]  movie.
[43:40.720 --> 43:46.420]  And it all just felt very like like these like segments of ideas like Baby Driver, where
[43:46.420 --> 43:49.320]  it was like I had this idea and it just sort of spawned the rest of the movie.
[43:49.620 --> 43:53.360]  That's how Hot Fuzz felt to me also is like I had this one idea and it just sort of spawns
[43:53.360 --> 43:54.320]  the rest of the movie around it.
[43:54.320 --> 43:58.140]  I like to just because it's so funny to have that combination of like Hollywood action
[43:58.140 --> 44:00.000]  with an English small town.
[44:00.280 --> 44:02.820]  I like Timothy Dalton in it.
[44:03.140 --> 44:04.000]  He's also hilarious.
[44:04.180 --> 44:05.660]  I thought he I thought he was like a lot of fun.
[44:05.700 --> 44:07.080]  I didn't recognize him at first.
[44:07.160 --> 44:08.780]  I don't know why I didn't recognize him.
[44:08.860 --> 44:10.020]  And then the mustache.
[44:10.300 --> 44:10.460]  Yeah.
[44:10.520 --> 44:11.540]  And then it was like, oh, shit.
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.620]  I thought he was like a lot of fun.
[44:14.200 --> 44:18.200]  I think it's fun that when I think of Hot Fuzz, the main thing I think of is them watching
[44:18.200 --> 44:18.980]  action movies.
[44:19.240 --> 44:20.660]  Like, that's the first thing that comes to mind.
[44:20.920 --> 44:22.900]  I'm watching Point Break losing it.
[44:22.900 --> 44:26.900]  I think of a church steeple wedged up Timothy Dalton's neck.
[44:27.220 --> 44:28.000]  Oh, God.
[44:28.280 --> 44:28.460]  Ew.
[44:28.980 --> 44:31.240]  So where does it go on the list?
[44:32.020 --> 44:32.460]  25.
[44:33.060 --> 44:34.160]  I would be fine with that.
[44:34.240 --> 44:35.320]  I'm totally fine with that.
[44:35.720 --> 44:36.160]  I'm totally fine with that.
[44:36.160 --> 44:38.420]  And the fact that you're okay with that, Nick, I'm very glad.
[44:38.840 --> 44:38.960]  Yeah.
[44:38.980 --> 44:42.840]  I mean, it's my last pick and it's a funny action movie.
[44:43.080 --> 44:45.440]  So I think that's probably where it goes.
[44:46.520 --> 44:46.600]  Um.
[44:46.740 --> 44:47.440]  I prefer Sean.
[44:47.740 --> 44:48.760]  Yeah, Sean of the Dead is better.
[44:49.000 --> 44:49.160]  Yeah.
[44:49.260 --> 44:50.340]  What was the other one?
[44:50.420 --> 44:51.900]  The last one nobody talks about?
[44:51.900 --> 44:52.880]  The World's End.
[44:53.040 --> 44:53.640]  The World's End.
[44:54.320 --> 44:55.220]  Did you guys like that one?
[44:55.780 --> 44:56.320]  Not really.
[44:56.820 --> 44:56.940]  No.
[44:57.380 --> 44:57.900]  Very different.
[44:58.340 --> 45:02.480]  And also came out at the same time as The End of the World, which made it really confusing.
[45:03.460 --> 45:04.440]  Oh, yeah, it did.
[45:05.420 --> 45:06.380]  Top Gun Maverick.
[45:06.960 --> 45:08.280]  Any thoughts on where that probably belongs?
[45:09.640 --> 45:11.320]  One of those I should have seen it, but haven't.
[45:11.560 --> 45:11.780]  20.
[45:12.080 --> 45:12.320]  I will.
[45:12.700 --> 45:13.280]  Yeah, 20.
[45:13.380 --> 45:13.820]  I put a 20.
[45:14.280 --> 45:21.100]  I think it's a visual masterpiece and such a generic plot, but just very cool to look
[45:21.100 --> 45:21.280]  at.
[45:21.380 --> 45:24.420]  I think it could go higher than 20, but I'm fine with putting it at 20.
[45:24.740 --> 45:28.020]  I could see it starting here and then we move it up to like 18.
[45:28.400 --> 45:29.380]  That would surprise me.
[45:29.680 --> 45:32.260]  That was going to say, yeah, I love the movie.
[45:32.420 --> 45:37.140]  I feel like the last action hero is not going to be ahead of Top Gun Maverick for best action
[45:37.140 --> 45:37.380]  movie.
[45:37.780 --> 45:38.540]  Yeah, that's tough.
[45:38.620 --> 45:43.180]  I like Last Action Hero, but again, I've seen it like so many times and I don't remember
[45:43.180 --> 45:45.920]  anything for I remember a part with a grenade.
[45:46.380 --> 45:47.660]  Put it at a 27.
[45:47.660 --> 45:51.600]  I think it's higher than 27, though.
[45:51.700 --> 45:52.100]  I would.
[45:52.360 --> 45:52.640]  Yeah.
[45:52.820 --> 45:53.220]  24?
[45:54.180 --> 45:54.260]  24.
[45:54.600 --> 45:56.660]  I think it's better than the rundown, but we can put it at 24.
[45:57.220 --> 45:58.620]  Oh, switch the rundown with it.
[45:58.840 --> 45:59.100]  No.
[46:00.300 --> 46:01.360]  Do you like...
[46:01.360 --> 46:02.620]  We could put a...
[46:02.620 --> 46:04.000]  You like The Rock more than Arnold Schwarzenegger, huh?
[46:05.500 --> 46:07.920]  Well, no, it's just they're both like one.
[46:08.000 --> 46:08.680]  They're both great.
[46:08.840 --> 46:10.100]  I would just put other things.
[46:10.420 --> 46:10.920]  I would put...
[46:10.920 --> 46:12.240]  I would move both of them up.
[46:12.500 --> 46:15.840]  What if we remove the rundown and put San Andreas on instead?
[46:16.300 --> 46:18.240]  That's not nearly as fun of a movie.
[46:18.900 --> 46:20.080]  What about Rampage?
[46:20.140 --> 46:20.640]  Big Monkey.
[46:20.900 --> 46:21.520]  He fight Big Monkey.
[46:21.920 --> 46:22.640]  Oh, he does.
[46:22.960 --> 46:23.160]  Yeah.
[46:23.440 --> 46:27.320]  Thing I really like about Last Action Hero is he's an action character that's put into
[46:27.320 --> 46:28.100]  the real world.
[46:28.520 --> 46:28.660]  Yeah.
[46:28.680 --> 46:31.940]  And they immediately have him punch out a window of a car and it just fucks him up.
[46:32.000 --> 46:32.440]  Like it's...
[46:32.440 --> 46:32.540]  Yeah.
[46:32.540 --> 46:33.720]  He's like, this fucking sucked.
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.200]  Like him being in the real world is just him getting his ass kicked.
[46:37.240 --> 46:42.540]  Part of the reason it wasn't so successful is it was too self-aware for the time.
[46:42.860 --> 46:43.060]  Yeah.
[46:43.060 --> 46:46.260]  I think the comedy was a little ahead of what people were ready for.
[46:46.520 --> 46:47.040]  Geoff, you're so right.
[46:47.040 --> 46:47.320]  I would agree.
[46:47.740 --> 46:49.600]  You're so right.
[46:49.860 --> 46:51.120]  It was in 94?
[46:51.480 --> 46:52.160]  Is that what you said?
[46:52.680 --> 46:53.480]  93, I think.
[46:53.540 --> 46:54.000]  94, yeah.
[46:54.560 --> 46:55.720]  Like that is so...
[46:55.720 --> 46:59.060]  Self-aware is not happening for like another decade.
[46:59.380 --> 46:59.580]  Yeah.
[47:00.480 --> 47:03.160]  We needed grunge before we were ready to be self-aware.
[47:03.500 --> 47:03.680]  Yeah.
[47:03.820 --> 47:04.060]  Definitely.
[47:10.360 --> 47:11.240]  How about...
[47:11.240 --> 47:11.740]  Oh, boy.
[47:11.800 --> 47:12.340]  Let's see.
[47:12.340 --> 47:19.440]  So we still didn't land on where speed belongs, but let's look at Edge of Tomorrow.
[47:20.200 --> 47:25.380]  I think Edge of Tomorrow is like, oh, man, I don't know.
[47:25.540 --> 47:26.900]  I'd put it below John Wick.
[47:27.100 --> 47:31.080]  I think I've seen that movie twice all the way through and I can't remember one thing
[47:31.080 --> 47:32.760]  about it other than I really like it.
[47:33.060 --> 47:35.840]  I remember the aliens moving all cool like.
[47:36.060 --> 47:36.240]  Yeah.
[47:36.520 --> 47:40.380]  I remember when he talks to the general and he goes, we've had this conversation before
[47:40.380 --> 47:41.760]  like so many times or whatever.
[47:42.000 --> 47:42.920]  And that that's the one.
[47:43.080 --> 47:45.540]  I don't know why that part sticks out in my head, but it does.
[47:46.740 --> 47:47.840]  It's really good.
[47:47.960 --> 47:48.620]  But I don't.
[47:48.700 --> 47:49.320]  It's so weird.
[47:49.320 --> 47:52.680]  We're like, I don't feel deeply about it, but it is really good.
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.400]  26?
[47:53.800 --> 47:55.240]  No, I'd put it like 18.
[47:55.780 --> 47:56.140]  I think.
[47:56.280 --> 47:56.440]  Yeah.
[47:56.460 --> 47:56.700]  18.
[47:57.040 --> 47:57.200]  Yeah.
[47:57.260 --> 47:59.500]  Like, I think that's a totally fine range.
[47:59.820 --> 48:00.120]  Sure.
[48:00.600 --> 48:00.860]  OK.
[48:01.060 --> 48:03.640]  Now I'm going to throw Ambulance out there.
[48:03.820 --> 48:05.600]  Any thoughts on Ambulance?
[48:06.040 --> 48:06.620]  Never seen it.
[48:06.980 --> 48:08.560]  I would put it in.
[48:09.320 --> 48:11.480]  I'd put it in the 20 to 31 range.
[48:11.880 --> 48:12.100]  28?
[48:13.320 --> 48:14.240]  I love it.
[48:14.260 --> 48:15.100]  I love Ambulance.
[48:15.220 --> 48:16.160]  I'll put it at 28.
[48:16.300 --> 48:17.140]  I love Ambulance.
[48:17.520 --> 48:18.340]  There's some good action.
[48:18.480 --> 48:19.200]  There's some cool shots.
[48:19.520 --> 48:20.520]  Overall, though.
[48:20.820 --> 48:21.100]  It is.
[48:21.260 --> 48:21.560]  It's.
[48:21.840 --> 48:22.340]  Holy shit.
[48:22.700 --> 48:23.700]  It is so.
[48:24.200 --> 48:24.940]  It's Mike.
[48:25.140 --> 48:26.660]  It feels like Michael Bay.
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.640]  The whole like surgery over FaceTime with Dr. Hoss.
[48:31.060 --> 48:31.180]  Shut up.
[48:31.560 --> 48:37.460]  It explodes like the Pinkalius or whatever explodes and then it goes into like drone
[48:37.460 --> 48:39.320]  shots and then they paint the ambulance green.
[48:39.580 --> 48:41.940]  And I still I've seen the movie a couple of times.
[48:42.080 --> 48:43.720]  I still don't know why they paint it green.
[48:44.240 --> 48:44.600]  Why?
[48:44.860 --> 48:45.280]  No idea.
[48:45.340 --> 48:48.600]  Especially if they're trying to go out with all the other ambulances.
[48:48.820 --> 48:50.000]  It's the one ambulance.
[48:50.140 --> 48:51.120]  It's fucking green.
[48:51.320 --> 48:52.300]  It's so good.
[48:52.420 --> 48:52.900]  I love it.
[48:52.960 --> 48:53.900]  I'll put it at 28.
[48:54.040 --> 48:56.620]  But I think it belongs much higher.
[48:56.980 --> 48:57.100]  No.
[48:57.360 --> 49:01.520]  Eric, I sent you the picture of the of me and the guy who did the FPV shots.
[49:01.880 --> 49:02.100]  Yeah.
[49:02.860 --> 49:03.580]  So awesome.
[49:03.580 --> 49:07.660]  I love that it was like just so many drone shots.
[49:07.820 --> 49:09.840]  It's Michael Bay going, oh, you think I fell off?
[49:09.960 --> 49:10.640]  Check this out.
[49:10.760 --> 49:12.520]  And you're just like, what happened?
[49:12.800 --> 49:13.960]  Where's this going?
[49:14.060 --> 49:14.740]  It goes everywhere.
[49:15.100 --> 49:15.660]  It's awesome.
[49:16.200 --> 49:16.740]  Let's see.
[49:17.080 --> 49:18.900]  Kingsman Secret Service.
[49:19.360 --> 49:22.780]  I think that's a really good movie.
[49:22.980 --> 49:24.680]  It's like all the way through.
[49:24.740 --> 49:25.860]  There's no lulls.
[49:25.900 --> 49:27.140]  There's no weak points in it.
[49:27.480 --> 49:28.580]  It's a lot of fun.
[49:28.900 --> 49:29.900]  I'd put it pretty high.
[49:29.900 --> 49:34.460]  I'd put it in the top 15 or top 20, rather, sorry, top 20.
[49:34.560 --> 49:35.280]  I'd put it 19.
[49:35.700 --> 49:35.820]  Sure.
[49:35.980 --> 49:36.860]  I'd do 19 or 16.
[49:37.040 --> 49:37.180]  Yeah.
[49:37.380 --> 49:42.880]  The way we're talking about sequels, it the first one to me has like people so loudly
[49:42.880 --> 49:47.740]  hated the sequels that it is tainted my memory of the first, which is not fair to that movie.
[49:47.940 --> 49:53.160]  Well, yeah, I mean, people hated Robocop two and three and Predator two, but we're not punishing
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.940]  those guys at the top or die hard to know.
[49:55.940 --> 50:00.340]  But I'm just saying when I think of Kingsman, like it is detracted from it.
[50:00.340 --> 50:04.080]  I'm just saying for me personally, I'm not saying that that is a negative, but just the
[50:04.080 --> 50:10.040]  feedback around Kingsman turned so bad that like I don't have the enthusiasm for it as
[50:10.040 --> 50:12.860]  a whole that I know I definitely had when I saw the first one.
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.240]  It was the only one that existed.
[50:14.860 --> 50:19.460]  I feel like the narrative of those movies changed because of the impacts of the sequels.
[50:19.620 --> 50:20.440]  Sounds a little negative.
[50:21.380 --> 50:25.000]  I am just saying for me, I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be wherever it is.
[50:25.340 --> 50:29.780]  That is just how I feel about it, but I'm not arguing that it should be higher or lower
[50:29.780 --> 50:30.680]  based on that.
[50:30.760 --> 50:31.560]  I'd be fine with 19.
[50:31.960 --> 50:33.080]  Yeah, 19 seems fine to me.
[50:33.240 --> 50:33.820]  You can live with that.
[50:34.440 --> 50:36.040]  I think it could be higher, but I think that's fine.
[50:36.480 --> 50:37.020]  Yeah, I could.
[50:37.100 --> 50:39.220]  I think it could be a little higher, too, but 19 is fine.
[50:39.500 --> 50:39.820]  Commando.
[50:40.140 --> 50:42.280]  Oh, number one, probably.
[50:43.580 --> 50:44.220]  It's high.
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.500]  It kind of, it kind of shepherded the genre in.
[50:47.800 --> 50:48.220]  I could put it.
[50:48.320 --> 50:48.620]  I could.
[50:48.740 --> 50:51.420]  I could definitely right here, like putting it at 10 and then fighting out.
[50:51.560 --> 50:52.320]  Yeah, we can do that.
[50:52.480 --> 50:53.080]  We can do that.
[50:53.180 --> 50:53.500]  Absolutely.
[50:53.500 --> 50:58.920]  The thing with Commando is it's so the beginning of it is so fucking awesome in the end of
[50:58.920 --> 50:59.020]  it.
[50:59.140 --> 51:00.040]  It's so fucking awesome.
[51:00.300 --> 51:02.220]  But there's this middle that sucks.
[51:02.500 --> 51:03.260]  I agree with you.
[51:03.320 --> 51:04.460]  I agree with you.
[51:04.620 --> 51:08.640]  I, I'm hard pressed to say that, like, the middle sucks, but boys, it's slow.
[51:09.160 --> 51:10.800]  Like definitely drags.
[51:10.900 --> 51:11.740]  It just is.
[51:12.000 --> 51:15.080]  They go to hijack a plane and that whole sequence is just so boring.
[51:15.500 --> 51:15.640]  Yeah.
[51:15.940 --> 51:16.100]  Yeah.
[51:16.200 --> 51:17.820]  It sounds fun on paper.
[51:18.480 --> 51:18.800]  It does.
[51:19.060 --> 51:23.240]  It is us getting Arnold Schwarzenegger as an action hero for the first time, though.
[51:23.240 --> 51:24.000]  It's pretty good.
[51:24.120 --> 51:25.160]  It's a lot of fun.
[51:25.460 --> 51:27.920]  Uh, we still need somewhere to put speed.
[51:28.880 --> 51:31.340]  I think speed is top 15, 16.
[51:31.680 --> 51:32.520]  I go 16.
[51:32.960 --> 51:33.920]  I go 16.
[51:34.120 --> 51:35.000]  I think speed's at 11.
[51:35.320 --> 51:38.060]  I think speed's a top 10 movie, but I put speed at 11.
[51:38.500 --> 51:43.300]  I, you know, looking at this list, I'm really happy with the idea of, like, John Wick being
[51:43.300 --> 51:45.880]  the 15 line of like things above and below.
[51:46.120 --> 51:50.840]  I think sort of grouping it as like a top 15, I'm, I'm good with top 15 personally, anywhere
[51:50.840 --> 51:51.480]  in the top 15.
[51:51.840 --> 51:52.040]  Geoff?
[51:52.040 --> 51:52.700]  I don't, I don't know.
[51:52.760 --> 51:54.820]  For me, speed 2 was such a disappointment.
[51:55.180 --> 51:56.680]  It tarnished the first one.
[51:56.920 --> 51:57.280]  Come on.
[51:57.840 --> 51:58.340]  I can't.
[51:58.560 --> 51:58.800]  I just.
[51:59.640 --> 52:00.560]  All right, fine.
[52:00.640 --> 52:00.980]  11.
[52:01.100 --> 52:01.260]  11.
[52:01.400 --> 52:02.560]  I'll pretend like speed 2 didn't happen.
[52:02.560 --> 52:02.960]  Yeah, why not?
[52:03.580 --> 52:04.060]  We'll do it.
[52:04.520 --> 52:06.180]  Um, keep going down the list.
[52:06.600 --> 52:06.940]  Gladiator.
[52:07.280 --> 52:12.140]  I could see it at like 12, 13, somewhere like around here.
[52:12.720 --> 52:15.020]  But also, I don't think of it as like an action movie.
[52:15.140 --> 52:17.880]  I think of all the parts in that movie that are action when I think of it.
[52:18.220 --> 52:20.320]  So I could see it going a little bit lower.
[52:20.320 --> 52:24.720]  When I think about that movie, I just think of fucking wheat fields blowing slowly in
[52:24.720 --> 52:24.880]  the wind.
[52:24.880 --> 52:26.960]  Me too, and his hand dragging through it and everything.
[52:27.360 --> 52:29.160]  That's all that I remember about that fucking film.
[52:29.740 --> 52:30.080]  Bury it.
[52:30.220 --> 52:30.900]  Bury it.
[52:31.020 --> 52:31.720]  As far as I'm concerned.
[52:32.360 --> 52:32.620]  What?
[52:33.140 --> 52:33.540]  27.
[52:35.180 --> 52:36.200]  I'd take 16.
[52:36.400 --> 52:37.380]  Ralphie loved it.
[52:37.780 --> 52:38.680]  16's probably fine.
[52:39.020 --> 52:39.220]  Okay.
[52:39.380 --> 52:40.740]  It's a beloved film.
[52:41.120 --> 52:46.300]  A lot of these top 10s I loved as a, as like a 13 year old, I didn't love Gladiator because
[52:46.300 --> 52:47.560]  of all the chatting.
[52:48.080 --> 52:48.280]  Yeah.
[52:49.160 --> 52:49.560]  Um.
[52:51.620 --> 52:54.200]  Oh, I'm so glad 300 didn't make the list.
[52:54.460 --> 52:55.040]  That's awesome.
[52:55.440 --> 52:57.540]  I'm going to work from bottom up here.
[52:57.780 --> 53:01.360]  Yes, Madam Supercops, you guys have never seen, but it is, it rocks.
[53:01.520 --> 53:03.320]  And I would love to show you a fight sequence from that.
[53:03.500 --> 53:04.400]  And you go, holy shit.
[53:04.720 --> 53:05.060]  I trust you.
[53:06.240 --> 53:07.120]  I love it.
[53:07.640 --> 53:08.080]  I love it.
[53:08.080 --> 53:08.300]  Yeah.
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.360]  I have no problem with it being higher.
[53:10.540 --> 53:12.660]  I just haven't seen it, but I trust that it's great.
[53:13.060 --> 53:13.280]  Yeah.
[53:13.280 --> 53:20.020]  I, I really, it's Michelle Yao before she's doing everything all at once or whatever.
[53:20.200 --> 53:22.280]  And she's the coolest fuck.
[53:22.380 --> 53:24.180]  Oh, her action stuff is so awesome.
[53:24.260 --> 53:26.340]  And Cynthia Rothrock, absolutely underrated.
[53:26.540 --> 53:27.180]  She's so cool.
[53:27.500 --> 53:31.240]  Aren't the Supercops, aren't they like the police story movies?
[53:31.540 --> 53:35.440]  That police story three, I think is called Supercops.
[53:35.520 --> 53:37.000]  And she's in that, right?
[53:37.040 --> 53:38.120]  And she's in that.
[53:38.400 --> 53:39.480]  And it's not connected.
[53:40.300 --> 53:43.020]  Yes, Madam is the name of the movie.
[53:43.240 --> 53:48.140]  And then in America, they titled it Supercops because they tried to, it's like a Hong Kong
[53:48.140 --> 53:48.820]  action movie.
[53:48.940 --> 53:50.640]  And they tried to like, let's just call it this.
[53:50.740 --> 53:54.420]  And then it was probably in connection with that because that's probably when it was released.
[53:54.840 --> 53:55.400]  I would think.
[53:56.180 --> 53:56.580]  Warriors.
[53:57.140 --> 54:00.760]  I love it, but I could definitely see you guys putting it lower on the list and I'm
[54:00.760 --> 54:02.000]  not going to fight super hard.
[54:02.460 --> 54:03.200]  I love it too.
[54:03.480 --> 54:04.460]  It's really fun.
[54:04.880 --> 54:06.100]  I just think it's, it's segmented.
[54:06.140 --> 54:07.260]  It tells such a great story.
[54:07.260 --> 54:09.360]  All the characters are really cool.
[54:09.520 --> 54:11.140]  I really, really love Warriors.
[54:11.360 --> 54:17.080]  I'd be okay with putting it above the Rundown and the Last Action Hero, personally, as the
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.180]  person who picked those two.
[54:18.320 --> 54:21.620]  So you're talking about moving these down a spot and then putting Warriors in there?
[54:22.080 --> 54:22.420]  That's fine.
[54:22.440 --> 54:23.080]  Yeah, move those three.
[54:23.560 --> 54:27.000]  I'm not going to try to move Action Jackson down below as well, but.
[54:27.020 --> 54:28.120]  No, you can't.
[54:28.460 --> 54:29.580]  It has action in the title.
[54:29.940 --> 54:31.200]  You don't want to split up the actions.
[54:31.560 --> 54:32.920]  No, no, it wouldn't make any sense.
[54:34.520 --> 54:35.400]  Raid two.
[54:35.730 --> 54:39.820]  If it's between 1, 12, and 27, it's top 15.
[54:40.060 --> 54:40.700]  What's it about?
[54:41.040 --> 54:41.660]  I agree.
[54:42.760 --> 54:44.080]  I don't think I've ever heard of it.
[54:44.620 --> 54:45.720]  What was Raid one about?
[54:46.200 --> 54:47.300]  Is it like a dedication?
[54:48.360 --> 54:54.900]  So the Raid one is about a SWAT team essentially taking over a building that is run by a drug
[54:54.900 --> 54:59.360]  lord and they have to get to the top floor, kicking ass every step along the way.
[54:59.960 --> 55:04.080]  The Raid two is a continuation of the lead of that story going undercover.
[55:04.080 --> 55:04.860]  Right down the building.
[55:06.440 --> 55:07.240]  He does.
[55:07.600 --> 55:10.800]  It is like an undercover cop story that's fucking awesome.
[55:11.160 --> 55:14.140]  Do you need to see the Raid one to enjoy the Raid two?
[55:14.480 --> 55:14.840]  No.
[55:15.280 --> 55:16.780]  I don't think you have to.
[55:16.900 --> 55:21.780]  I think it definitely adds to it, but I think Raid two is so out, like the action is so
[55:21.780 --> 55:22.700]  cool that like.
[55:22.940 --> 55:26.980]  Yeah, there's that bit where he's getting like stuffed into the, was it like a stall?
[55:27.200 --> 55:27.840]  He's like fighting.
[55:28.060 --> 55:28.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:28.960 --> 55:31.940]  I saw Raid two before one and I thought the order was fine.
[55:31.940 --> 55:33.760]  And I could be wrong.
[55:34.100 --> 55:36.500]  I think they reuse actors between them.
[55:36.540 --> 55:39.820]  Like I think they're characters that maybe die, but I could be wrong about that.
[55:39.960 --> 55:40.280]  I like that.
[55:40.300 --> 55:45.240]  It seems like such a foreign film franchise, but it's made by a guy from Wales.
[55:45.740 --> 55:45.980]  Yeah.
[55:46.060 --> 55:47.000]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[55:47.380 --> 55:47.560]  Yeah.
[55:47.860 --> 55:48.420]  Oh, that's weird.
[55:48.520 --> 55:48.660]  Great.
[55:49.200 --> 55:50.200]  OK, here's the thing.
[55:50.440 --> 55:52.700]  I want to put, because I'm looking at what we have left.
[55:52.900 --> 55:56.080]  It's Raid two, Air Force one and Crank two.
[55:56.260 --> 55:58.000]  And I want to put Raid two.
[55:58.700 --> 56:00.680]  I'm not saying it goes at number one.
[56:00.680 --> 56:04.200]  I'm saying we need something in the top ten so we can juggle around this top ten.
[56:04.600 --> 56:06.300]  Not Crank two or Air Force one.
[56:06.480 --> 56:06.780]  Exactly.
[56:07.260 --> 56:07.540]  Yes.
[56:07.980 --> 56:08.400]  OK, cool.
[56:08.860 --> 56:10.580]  That's that's what I was driving at.
[56:11.720 --> 56:17.320]  So Crank two, I think, oh, man, between twelve and twenty seven.
[56:17.600 --> 56:18.120]  Twenty seven.
[56:18.600 --> 56:20.400]  Yeah, I think so, too.
[56:20.660 --> 56:21.840]  I don't mind wherever it's placed.
[56:21.980 --> 56:23.940]  I think it personally, it should be higher.
[56:24.280 --> 56:25.480]  I don't think Air Force one is.
[56:25.700 --> 56:26.900]  No, it's certainly not.
[56:26.960 --> 56:29.480]  No, Air Force one is definitely at the bottom.
[56:30.080 --> 56:31.480]  It's a lot of things sliding up.
[56:31.860 --> 56:34.700]  Yeah, I think things will have to slide up maybe from like.
[56:34.900 --> 56:38.020]  OK, so let's let's start sliding because we got Air Force one.
[56:38.100 --> 56:38.860]  We got to put this somewhere.
[56:38.980 --> 56:40.060]  So where do you think this goes?
[56:40.300 --> 56:41.120]  Twenty three.
[56:42.300 --> 56:43.120]  And then everything else.
[56:43.420 --> 56:43.640]  I love.
[56:43.800 --> 56:44.020]  OK.
[56:44.920 --> 56:45.100]  OK.
[56:45.180 --> 56:46.360]  I love that Nick was.
[56:46.720 --> 56:47.160]  Yeah.
[56:47.480 --> 56:48.620]  And everything up goes up.
[56:48.720 --> 56:48.860]  Yeah.
[56:49.100 --> 56:49.420]  OK.
[56:49.980 --> 56:51.800]  Action Jackson now at twenty one.
[56:54.760 --> 56:55.760]  That makes sense.
[56:56.080 --> 56:56.360]  Yeah.
[56:56.580 --> 56:57.020]  All right.
[56:57.240 --> 56:57.680]  And.
[56:57.980 --> 56:58.080]  OK.
[56:58.720 --> 56:58.940]  Done.
[56:59.440 --> 57:00.780]  I think that's the list.
[57:01.020 --> 57:01.940]  Number one.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.260]  OK, so now let's look at the top.
[57:03.540 --> 57:04.860]  Let's look at this top ten.
[57:05.360 --> 57:07.220]  I would immediately swap four with two.
[57:07.560 --> 57:07.780]  Yes.
[57:07.860 --> 57:08.120]  Yes.
[57:08.300 --> 57:08.660]  Definitely.
[57:09.340 --> 57:09.700]  Definitely.
[57:09.980 --> 57:10.340]  Definitely.
[57:10.640 --> 57:12.320]  Now here's now here's what I'm looking at.
[57:12.400 --> 57:13.900]  I think Terminator one should be number one.
[57:14.040 --> 57:15.220]  Terminator one should be number one.
[57:15.440 --> 57:15.940]  I'm sorry.
[57:16.160 --> 57:17.740]  Terminator two should be number one.
[57:17.880 --> 57:18.440]  You know what?
[57:18.480 --> 57:18.940]  I go with that.
[57:18.980 --> 57:19.880]  I wouldn't fight you on that.
[57:19.980 --> 57:20.120]  Yeah.
[57:20.180 --> 57:22.740]  It's so iconic that like I'm not going to fight that.
[57:23.300 --> 57:24.260]  Would it personally be mine?
[57:24.380 --> 57:24.640]  No.
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.340]  But like, I think it is like such a classic action.
[57:28.860 --> 57:29.520]  Great movie.
[57:29.700 --> 57:30.420]  It's great.
[57:30.580 --> 57:30.700]  Cool.
[57:30.900 --> 57:31.340]  Terminator.
[57:31.560 --> 57:31.960]  Shut up.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.440]  Somebody else can do this next time.
[57:34.480 --> 57:34.640]  Shut up.
[57:34.640 --> 57:35.020]  I can't wait.
[57:35.100 --> 57:36.960]  I can't wait for the audience Terminator posters.
[57:37.760 --> 57:40.780]  Earlier he typoed bad boys is like bad buoys.
[57:42.100 --> 57:43.240]  Oh bad buoys.
[57:43.720 --> 57:44.200]  Bad boys.
[57:44.220 --> 57:44.560]  I think.
[57:44.780 --> 57:45.740]  Baba bad buoy.
[57:46.360 --> 57:49.180]  I think Die Hard should be higher.
[57:50.300 --> 57:51.120]  I love.
[57:51.120 --> 57:52.660]  I love Die Hard.
[57:53.240 --> 57:54.280]  I love Die Hard.
[57:54.520 --> 57:57.240]  I think Die Hard is a better movie than Robocop.
[57:57.240 --> 57:57.840]  I agree.
[57:58.100 --> 57:58.400]  I would.
[57:58.580 --> 58:00.000]  I would swap Robocop and Die Hard.
[58:00.300 --> 58:00.860]  I'm fine with that.
[58:00.940 --> 58:01.060]  Yeah.
[58:01.280 --> 58:02.180]  I'm fine with that too.
[58:02.860 --> 58:03.240]  I guess.
[58:03.400 --> 58:03.620]  Yeah.
[58:03.980 --> 58:07.180]  Now, I personally think Predator is a better film than Die Hard.
[58:07.500 --> 58:07.820]  Really?
[58:08.300 --> 58:09.580]  I would have Predator top five.
[58:09.920 --> 58:11.140]  I think Predator number three.
[58:11.220 --> 58:12.500]  I'm really I'm feeling good about.
[58:12.880 --> 58:13.740]  I think I think it's good.
[58:13.960 --> 58:16.300]  I think bad boys too belongs above the raid, right?
[58:17.220 --> 58:18.360]  Uh, shit.
[58:18.380 --> 58:19.400]  We got heat on here.
[58:19.580 --> 58:19.940]  Fuck.
[58:20.380 --> 58:20.560]  Yeah.
[58:20.600 --> 58:21.740]  This is where it gets tough.
[58:22.440 --> 58:25.580]  Geoff, anything stick out to you on this list that you think like on like the top 10 that
[58:25.580 --> 58:26.960]  you think should definitely shift?
[58:27.300 --> 58:30.380]  The only other thing I would switch is I think Casino Royale and Heat.
[58:30.460 --> 58:31.860]  I would flip personally.
[58:32.180 --> 58:33.920]  You think that's that's the only swap there?
[58:34.060 --> 58:35.020]  I'm not opposed to that.
[58:35.380 --> 58:38.600]  I just I yeah, I think it's a slight I mean, it's close, right?
[58:38.620 --> 58:39.640]  But I just think it's.
[58:39.780 --> 58:40.420]  Did I swap them?
[58:41.220 --> 58:41.360]  Yeah.
[58:41.780 --> 58:41.920]  Yeah.
[58:41.920 --> 58:42.020]  Okay.
[58:42.080 --> 58:42.420]  Yeah.
[58:42.420 --> 58:42.680]  Sorry.
[58:43.740 --> 58:45.940]  I was doing it and like zoned out.
[58:46.000 --> 58:46.640]  I don't know what happened.
[58:46.940 --> 58:49.920]  Um, I really like the raid too.
[58:49.980 --> 58:53.180]  I'm okay with it sliding down just because most people haven't seen it.
[58:53.180 --> 58:57.760]  I think Bad Boys 2, I like more than Raid 2, but shit.
[58:58.040 --> 58:59.880]  But I like Commando so much.
[59:00.100 --> 59:02.040]  Yeah, I'm okay with Commando being a 10.
[59:02.500 --> 59:02.820]  Fuck.
[59:03.120 --> 59:03.420]  I love it.
[59:03.420 --> 59:09.040]  It's a it's a good fucking movie, but it's also very dated at this point.
[59:09.080 --> 59:09.200]  Okay.
[59:09.240 --> 59:11.940]  Now look at look at our bottom of the top 10.
[59:12.100 --> 59:15.360]  Commando, The Rock, Heat, Casino Royale, Robocop.
[59:15.720 --> 59:18.020]  Any of these need to shift or you think that feels pretty good?
[59:18.500 --> 59:19.240]  I think I like them.
[59:19.380 --> 59:20.600]  I'm pretty okay with that.
[59:20.600 --> 59:23.640]  Yeah, like I, I just I would need Commando in the top 10.
[59:23.840 --> 59:24.680]  So I'm happy with it.
[59:24.780 --> 59:25.620]  Yeah, I'm down with that.
[59:25.920 --> 59:26.200]  Gavin?
[59:26.580 --> 59:26.760]  Yeah.
[59:27.020 --> 59:28.240]  Now, top five.
[59:28.560 --> 59:31.920]  Bad Boys 2, Raid 2, Predator, Die Hard, Terminator.
[59:32.100 --> 59:33.420]  I could swap Predator and Die Hard.
[59:33.840 --> 59:39.960]  Like looking at this, if Heat isn't in this running, then I wouldn't be opposed to swapping
[59:39.960 --> 59:40.780]  Predator with Die Hard.
[59:40.940 --> 59:42.660]  I think Die Hard is great.
[59:42.820 --> 59:43.340]  I love it.
[59:43.680 --> 59:47.220]  But I wouldn't put up much of a fight if somebody said Predator belongs at two.
[59:47.220 --> 59:51.820]  I would be happy with putting Predator two, but like I'm also like Die Hard is great.
[59:52.440 --> 59:52.560]  Yeah.
[59:52.740 --> 59:56.540]  I would have Predator two, but split splitting hairs, right?
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.340]  That's how this that's how this feels like these two feel like they're on equal ground,
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.820]  but that equal ground is just a little bit lower than Terminator 2.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:05.740]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.920]  I would put Bad Boys 2 above Raid 2, but that's just me.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.700]  Oh, Raid 2 is just such...
[01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.720]  I mean, Raid 2 is so cool.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.080]  It has a great car chase.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.460]  Yeah, I'm fine with it.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:16.960]  If that's where Bad Girl...
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.360]  Did we just do it?
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.360]  I think that's the top ten.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.120]  Are we sure that Looney Tunes Back in Action doesn't need to move up anywhere?
[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.340]  I would move it above Action Point, personally.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.300]  You're welcome.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.420]  I'm OK with flipping it with Action Point.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.200]  OK, cool.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.760]  I'm just happy Action Point made the top 30.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.560]  I think that's fair.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.520]  This is the top 30 movies of all time.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.040]  Have you seen a civil action, Geoff?
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.520]  Would you say it's better than Ambulance?
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.300]  I haven't seen Ambulance, so I can't compare.
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.300]  Yeah, you're missing out, dude.
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.140]  We've got to watch Ambulance.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.180]  You let me know.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:47.820]  We'll find time.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.740]  We'll watch it before the Tyson fight.
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:50.100]  I think...
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:57.020]  I don't want to start any fights here or anything, but I think Crank 2 is better than the Rundown.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.480]  I agree with that.
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.720]  Yeah, I'd take that.
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.000]  Well, listen, OK, I was thinking about it.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:06.840]  The Rundown opens with The Rock beating up the offensive line of the Cowboys, which is
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.480]  fucking awesome.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.920]  I get why Nick Slander's it.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:09.960]  Not a Nick Slander.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:10.700]  Get out of here.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:11.660]  Oh!
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.640]  Hidden agendas.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:13.940]  Uh-huh.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.140]  Just throwing that out there.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:15.700]  Just floating it.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:16.340]  As cowboys fit.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.120]  Cowboys beat themselves up.
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.440]  OK, so let's...
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.860]  That is true.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.120]  Leave it to the professionals.
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.060]  And by that, I mean themselves.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.820]  Do we want to put Crank 2 at 24?
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.520]  Sure.
[01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:25.260]  What if...
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.500]  Yeah, and then we just slide everything else down.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:26.960]  OK, here's the thing.
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:27.840]  Yeah.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:27.960]  OK.
[01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.040]  I would...
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.180]  I'm happy with Crank 2 above the Rundown.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.580]  I'm not happy with the Rundown below Hot Fuzz.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.180]  No, no, no.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.180]  These are shifting down.
[01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.280]  You think the Rundown's better than Hot Fuzz?
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:38.900]  Yes, I do.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.180]  I think that's insanity.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.960]  I agree with you on this.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.620]  I mean, it sounds wrong, but I haven't seen the Rundown, so you could be right.
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.740]  I will say this.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.420]  Christopher Walken is so good in it.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.180]  The Rundown is a good movie.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:49.940]  OK.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.340]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:52.400]  Is...
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.380]  Who's the sidekick?
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:53.700]  Sean William Scott.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.520]  Sean William Scott, right?
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.040]  Sean William Scott and Rosario Dawson and Christopher Walken.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.180]  And The Rock plays this, like, debt collector, essentially, who doesn't use guns.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:04.800]  Yeah.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380]  You know what?
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:06.940]  You're right.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:07.780]  I was thinking of Walk Tall.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:08.400]  Yep.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.240]  You're on my board.
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.140]  No, yeah.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.780]  Walk Tall sucks.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.500]  Fuck Walk Tall.
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.400]  Walk Tall sucks.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.420]  That's a little ginoxal.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.600]  That would be no good.
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.860]  He's fighting dudes with whip in The Rundown.
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:18.420]  He's...
[01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.480]  He wants to be a chef.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.740]  You know that's a remake?
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:21.460]  Yes.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.060]  I did know that.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:22.340]  Yeah.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.180]  I was a big fan of those movies when I was a kid.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.140]  The thing about The Rundown is I think it's, like, one of the last times The Rock has hair
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:29.580]  in a movie.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.420]  It is.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.360]  I think after that, he's, like, bald or in, like, a funny wig.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:40.040]  It was the thing where they have Arnold Schwarzenegger passing the symbolic action movie torch to
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.520]  him in that movie, but then he signed a deal with Disney and just made kids' movies for
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.360]  the next nine years.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520]  So it doesn't...
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.280]  The handoff didn't work.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:47.760]  Nope.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:50.440]  Anything else on this list that you guys think should shift around?
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.080]  No.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:51.780]  Like, I feel...
[01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:52.320]  No, I think it's good.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:52.880]  I feel pretty...
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.000]  Like, the things that I haven't seen, I'm not gonna fight for or, like, fight against.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.480]  Yeah.
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.800]  It's a solid list.
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.440]  I think this is a really good list.
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:02:59.860]  Yeah.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:00.600]  I like it.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:01.380]  It would be interesting...
[01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.760]  We won't do this because of the time commitment.
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.840]  It'd be interesting if we all watched all these movies and then came back to the list.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.060]  I've seen most of them.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.160]  So you want us to watch Looney Tunes back in action?
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:11.940]  Oh, I'm...
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.520]  Simple action.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.200]  No.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.580]  I just said it would be...
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.100]  It would be interesting to re-rank them.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.880]  But we should not do this.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.500]  I don't know.
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.140]  It's only...
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:21.460]  What is that?
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.840]  62 hours, probably?
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:23.360]  Oh, is that it?
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:23.800]  Great.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:24.480]  Great.
[01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:25.500]  Then I think we did it.
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:27.760]  I think we have our top 31.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.340]  Top 5.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.180]  At number 5, Bad Boys 2.
[01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.440]  At number 4, Raid 2.
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.460]  Number 3 is Predator.
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.020]  Number 2 is Die Hard.
[01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.800]  Number 1, Terminator 2.
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:38.620]  Good list.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:43.160]  There are things in action movies sometimes where it's like action itself is not, you
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.740]  know, like it's a badass moment without action.
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.620]  That high five handshake thing at the beginning of Predator is so fucking cool.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.120]  Yeah.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.940]  The flexing.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.100]  Oh, it's awesome.
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.240]  Jesse Ventura is so fucking awesome in that movie.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.420]  How much...
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:57.940]  How many Terminator movies are there?
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:58.480]  Oh my god.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.420]  No, I think it's 6.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:00.980]  There's more than that, right?
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:02.100]  I think it's like 6 or 7, isn't it?
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.720]  1, 2, 3, Salvation.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.020]  Salvation.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:04.580]  Genesis.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.040]  And 1...
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.320]  Yeah, so like 6 or 7.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:07.960]  Damn.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.700]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.440]  There are 6 Terminator movies.
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.160]  I've got a lot of Terminators to watch.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.280]  That's what I'm moving on to after I finish Aliens.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.900]  No, no, no you don't.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:17.780]  I do.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:18.600]  I gotta see them all.
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.740]  I've never seen 4, 5, and 6.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:21.520]  I've only seen the first 3.
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.420]  Much like Alien, you can stop at 2.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.600]  Yeah, it's...
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.580]  I mean, just...
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:26.940]  I don't know.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.860]  You think Terminator Dark Fate is going to be worth your time?
[01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:31.800]  I gotta find out what happens in the universe.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.580]  It's in Gears of War 5.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.680]  So, Geoff has to see it as part of our Gears.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.020]  Oh, that's true.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:36.680]  That is true.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.400]  It is a big part of Gears.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.600]  I saw Terminator Dark Fate in the theaters.
[01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.700]  And we went with a bunch of people from Rooster Teeth.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:44.960]  And that was...
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:45.400]  Remember Tobin?
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:45.960]  Yeah.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.580]  One of our designers?
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.920]  That was the first Terminator movie he ever saw.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.320]  Oh, no.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.540]  So, that was the last Terminator movie he ever saw?
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:53.600]  It's...
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:54.560]  Learning...
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.640]  I had him do something for us, and I used Terminator 2 as a reference point.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.300]  And learning later that he has never seen it is very funny to me.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:02.500]  Nope.
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.160]  He saw...
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:07.060]  No, but you should have just said, it's like Terminator, you know, Dark Fate.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.040]  You know, I've been watching, you know, I watched Prometheus and Covenant, and then that
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.180]  got me really excited about just the alien universe.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.660]  And so, I did watch a bunch of YouTube videos to find out about the history and everything.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.540]  And I thought, oh, I wonder if there's novelizations that are canon.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.360]  Do you know how many alien books there are?
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.160]  Oh, that does not shock me.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:27.940]  I've read a lot of...
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.300]  That are canon?
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.320]  Are they canon?
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:29.720]  Oh, really?
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.280]  Like, 40?
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.800]  Oh my God.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.220]  Okay, that's more than I anticipated.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:34.960]  They canonize them?
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:35.140]  Wow.
[01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.900]  Who decides what's canon and what isn't?
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.020]  I don't know.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.160]  They're all supposed to be in the timeline.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.600]  There's like a million of them, and they're all like...
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.420]  It's crazy.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.580]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:45.640]  I started to look into it last night.
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:46.840]  I thought, maybe I'll read an alien book.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.420]  Where do I start?
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.220]  And I just gave up.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:48.980]  I was like, never mind, though.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:49.680]  It's too much.
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.100]  Do you think Ridley Scott gets to make that call?
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:56.180]  Do you think he's sitting down looking at the novelizations like he puts on his glasses
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:00.240]  next to a fireplace, and he just has like a stack of alien books, and he's like, I'm
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.360]  going to read all these and let you know which ones are real and not.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.280]  I think it probably has more to do with how big the check is, honestly.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:13.460]  Because they have like Dark Horse comic series that were canon that they've novelized and
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:15.880]  then made sequels to those novelizations.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:16.900]  I mean, it's deep.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:17.580]  It's weird.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:18.220]  Right.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:23.560]  I think that when you start getting into the canonization of stuff, I think it gets crazy.
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.580]  Because that was all Star Wars.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.100]  Yeah.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:27.540]  Yes.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.060]  It happened with Halo, too.
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.200]  I read all those.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.840]  And then I went, why did I read all these?
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.980]  You just said they're not canon.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:33.640]  What was that?
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.260]  Timothy Zahn?
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:35.860]  Was that his name?
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.040]  Uh, he was one of them.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:37.400]  He wrote all those books?
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:37.600]  Yeah.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.280]  Mm-hmm.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.640]  They just did away with it all.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.460]  That sucked.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:41.280]  Yeah.
[01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:41.960]  That really sucked.
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.900]  Now it's Legends instead of EU.
[01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:44.820]  Expand Universe.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.120]  Yep.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.720]  Well, there you have it.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:47.820]  Oh, we're going to...
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.520]  Oh, fight scene?
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:49.280]  Oh.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:51.280]  Watch this shit.
[01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:51.960]  OK.
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.960]  Oh, we got a guy with two swords.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640]  He's swinging away.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.040]  You know what's a really great...
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.560]  We're just talking about martial arts.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.180]  Uh-huh.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:01.540]  Mm-hmm.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.940]  Have you guys ever seen The Street Fighter?
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.320]  The Sonny Chiba film, The Street Fighter?
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:04.900]  Yeah.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:05.400]  No.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:05.780]  No.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.840]  One of the best movies ever made.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.220]  I would have...
[01:07:07.220 --> 01:07:09.020]  If I was doing my list...
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:09.420]  God damn.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.740]  ...legitimately, I would have had it on there.
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.580]  See, this is why I wanted this on the list.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.520]  Yeah, this will be three hits.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.440]  Cynthia Rothrock, fucking rules.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.360]  Watch this shit.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.500]  Oh my God, this is going to be so cool.
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:22.360]  Sound design is awesome.
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.060]  Oh, yeah.
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:23.920]  It's so...
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:30.260]  This is just a genre of itself, and it's so sick, unstoppable.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.340]  Like how many takes to do all this stuff?
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:34.620]  What?
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.400]  Oh my God, it's so cool.
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.680]  I think they said first take.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:38.300]  Yeah.
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:39.480]  One and done, baby.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:39.900]  Just one.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.960]  I love these movies because they do so much in extended periods on a wide lens, and you
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.120]  get to see massive choreographed sections.
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:50.040]  Oh my God, it's so cool.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.620]  Which you don't ever really get on Hollywood movies.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:53.520]  And then isn't it...
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.440]  Oh shit.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:55.900]  Through the glass.
[01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:07.960]  And then the star of this movie is now like a Hollywood...
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.060]  She's in everything.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:09.720]  Yeah.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.060]  I don't know.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:10.720]  This rocks.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.480]  This is so cool.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:11.980]  Yeah, this is very cool.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.140]  I think we talked about this in the other one.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.960]  When she was in a James Bond film, they had to bring in her stunt team, the Jackie Chan
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.520]  stunt team, because she was just punching all the Hollywood stunt guys for real.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.180]  Oh, it's so sick.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.420]  Oh my God, it's so cool.
[01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:25.940]  So cool.
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:27.300]  Oh, fucking awesome.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:32.700]  When I was a kid on Sunday mornings, they had kung fu theater and they would show two
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.900]  movies early Sunday morning and I'd get up every Sunday morning to watch it.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.160]  That is one of the most enjoyable rituals I had in my life.
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.060]  I would...
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:41.960]  I'm being serious right here.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:47.280]  I would genuinely consider turning that into a show where we got together and watched kung
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.340]  fu films together on Sunday mornings.
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:49.020]  Oh my God.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.460]  Just as a live stream.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.620]  Like I would die to do that with you all.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:53.140]  Geoff, I have a hard drive.
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.500]  Oh, Geoff, I have a hard drive.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.840]  You ever watch Fist Fighter from 89 or Death Promise?
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.040]  Oh my God.
[01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:00.660]  I want to show you Parole Violators.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.200]  I want to show you Future Kick.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.780]  Oh, this is going to be so sick.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.880]  Dude, I would love...
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.800]  And I could pull some of the old ones that I used to watch when I was a kid.
[01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.800]  I would fucking love for us to get together and do that in some way.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.100]  Let's do it.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.180]  Just like kung fu theater or like martial arts madness or something, you know?
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:14.920]  That would be so cool.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.840]  I think we're good with the list.
[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:18.040]  Yeah, I think it's a great list.
[01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:18.500]  Way to go.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.400]  Yeah, so much fun.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.460]  This is awesome.
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.900]  We need to do this again.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.740]  It's sort of like, as you said, Geoff, the 98 thing, but this is the first episode of
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:28.780]  Action Movie Ranker.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:29.840]  What will we rank next?
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.060]  I don't know.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:31.980]  We'll find out.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.660]  But until then, thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.360]  Make sure to check out our Patreon at The Regulation Pod.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.660]  We do gameplays at also Regulation Gameplay, I believe, is the name of that channel.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:44.660]  We do streams.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.480]  We do all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:46.880]  But thank you so much for listening.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.080]  Check those things out.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.640]  Have a great rest of your day.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:52.040]  Does everybody like six different cheeses?
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:53.100]  Ooh.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.060]  I can rank some cheeses, dude.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:55.620]  Absolutely.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.260]  That's a trough, though.
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:58.420]  We're going to have our cheeses stolen.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.140]  Bye!
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:00.180]  Bye!
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.280]  Bye!
