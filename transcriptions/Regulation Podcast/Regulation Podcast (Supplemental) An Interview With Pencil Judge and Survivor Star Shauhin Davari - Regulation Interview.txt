[00:00.000 --> 00:04.640]  Hello and welcome to a special regulation supplemental
[00:04.640 --> 00:07.020]  for the first time in our show's history.
[00:07.240 --> 00:08.800]  This is big. We have a guest.
[00:09.220 --> 00:10.040]  We've never done this.
[00:10.300 --> 00:13.420]  We've been very anti-guest in our history.
[00:13.940 --> 00:18.220]  Let me just jump in real quick and say that you need to eat the damn pencil, man.
[00:18.380 --> 00:19.820]  No! You understand?
[00:20.240 --> 00:22.800]  No! Right now? Never! Never!
[00:23.260 --> 00:24.980]  I'm sending you fried pencil.
[00:25.160 --> 00:27.240]  I'll even fry it up and send it to you.
[00:27.740 --> 00:29.680]  But do you have any idea
[00:29.680 --> 00:32.760]  how many of your listeners are popping into my comments?
[00:32.940 --> 00:36.400]  They literally have gone on to my mother's Instagram page.
[00:36.420 --> 00:41.200]  No! Can you tell Shaheen to tell Andrew to eat the pencil?
[00:42.400 --> 00:44.540]  And I don't know how these...
[00:44.540 --> 00:47.220]  First of all, thank you, Regulation Podcast listeners.
[00:47.460 --> 00:50.700]  I am thrilled every time I see a comment
[00:50.700 --> 00:52.580]  that tells me to tell you to eat the pencil.
[00:53.040 --> 00:56.000]  And listen, man, it's OK. You cannot eat the pencil.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.720]  You just have to say, I am not a man of my word.
[01:00.860 --> 01:01.660]  I always...
[01:01.660 --> 01:03.660]  You should never make a bet with Andrew.
[01:04.160 --> 01:08.200]  As long as you say those things and then we can record it
[01:08.200 --> 01:10.540]  and then we can play it at your funeral.
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.020]  Uh-huh.
[01:13.300 --> 01:15.760]  No one can, you know, be confused.
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.220]  Well, first of all, I'd like to counter with, I'm an honorable man.
[01:19.580 --> 01:22.620]  Second of all, all of these comments are kind of your fault.
[01:22.860 --> 01:25.400]  If you would have gave the other ruling, nobody would be submitting it.
[01:25.400 --> 01:26.300]  So that's kind of on you.
[01:26.720 --> 01:27.780]  That's not how this works, Andrew.
[01:27.880 --> 01:31.860]  I think that what needs to happen is you need to eat the pencil, not for us,
[01:31.860 --> 01:35.000]  but to alleviate the pressure on Shaheen and his family,
[01:35.360 --> 01:38.200]  seriously, that you have unduly put upon them.
[01:38.280 --> 01:41.840]  I know I once again, I blame the ruling, less so my lack of action.
[01:42.400 --> 01:45.800]  Yeah. I want everyone to know I know this is not a video podcast,
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.720]  but I did bring a pencil.
[01:48.820 --> 01:52.400]  Yeah, I'm holding it the entire time.
[01:54.020 --> 01:55.620]  Interestingly, it's it is a pen.
[01:55.740 --> 01:56.900]  It doesn't have an eraser.
[01:57.020 --> 01:58.140]  So I even removed the eraser.
[01:58.440 --> 01:59.640]  Wow. I know.
[02:00.120 --> 02:03.300]  I'd be more concerned about the metal part than the eraser.
[02:03.540 --> 02:05.260]  But I appreciate the eraser removal.
[02:05.520 --> 02:06.760]  Yeah, no problem.
[02:07.020 --> 02:08.400]  Any anything I can do for you?
[02:10.200 --> 02:14.780]  Also, I am thrilled that you now know how seasons work.
[02:14.980 --> 02:16.840]  I am just...
[02:18.620 --> 02:20.360]  Listen, I'm locked in.
[02:20.720 --> 02:21.720]  For you, I did that for you.
[02:21.720 --> 02:22.460]  Thank you.
[02:22.540 --> 02:23.340]  That was important to you.
[02:23.400 --> 02:24.020]  I wanted to make sure.
[02:24.580 --> 02:26.180]  My real name is Shaheen.
[02:26.260 --> 02:27.760]  It's not it's not it's not a stage name.
[02:27.820 --> 02:28.620]  That's my real name.
[02:28.840 --> 02:29.660]  Oh, that's great.
[02:29.920 --> 02:31.340]  It means royal white falcon.
[02:31.660 --> 02:33.260]  I know you're protected by falcons.
[02:33.540 --> 02:34.040]  That's incredible.
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.320]  That was another layer of just absurdity around all of this.
[02:38.600 --> 02:42.060]  Yeah, the the similarities are striking.
[02:42.600 --> 02:45.940]  OK. Oh, I'm which similarities?
[02:46.300 --> 02:50.160]  Well, we are a podcast that is protected by falcons and falcon is your name.
[02:50.260 --> 02:51.020]  I don't know if you know this,
[02:51.020 --> 02:54.540]  but we discovered we went to we went to a hotel in Mexico
[02:54.540 --> 02:58.060]  for a vacation two years ago, and we kept seeing this guy
[02:58.060 --> 03:01.180]  walk around with a hooded falcon around the pool and stuff.
[03:01.240 --> 03:01.680]  So we went up.
[03:01.720 --> 03:03.360]  Finally, we got up the courage to talk to him.
[03:03.480 --> 03:06.280]  And he said, yeah, the hotel is protected by this falcon.
[03:06.540 --> 03:07.840]  It keeps the birds away.
[03:07.940 --> 03:11.620]  Then we found out there's an entire industry where large hotels
[03:11.620 --> 03:17.740]  have full time falcon staffs to keep birds and pests away on the beach.
[03:17.740 --> 03:19.140]  And it really opened our world.
[03:19.960 --> 03:24.300]  We've decided that the falcon to be the appropriate protector of our podcast.
[03:24.400 --> 03:27.140]  And then here we are talking to the royal white life.
[03:27.300 --> 03:29.720]  Royal white falcon. Yeah, exactly right.
[03:29.880 --> 03:32.600]  And just like for the absurdity, for your context, like Survivor,
[03:32.700 --> 03:34.900]  probably the most important show in my life.
[03:34.940 --> 03:38.860]  Like I started watching first season when I was like five or six.
[03:39.120 --> 03:41.920]  Oh, it is something that I would watch every week with my mom.
[03:41.960 --> 03:44.680]  It was like one of the most important shows for me.
[03:44.720 --> 03:48.620]  So the fact that the you of all people
[03:48.620 --> 03:52.780]  end up on Survivor and also have this strange connection
[03:52.780 --> 03:56.240]  where as much as you're talking about being hounded about Eat the Pencil,
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.700]  I get it constantly on all forms.
[03:58.820 --> 03:59.840]  It's something I live with.
[03:59.980 --> 04:04.220]  So to learn that you were going to be on the show was so just absurd.
[04:04.420 --> 04:05.840]  Like the world doesn't make sense.
[04:06.160 --> 04:08.960]  Yeah, I share that with you, too, man.
[04:09.020 --> 04:10.620]  I watched Survivor with my mom.
[04:10.680 --> 04:13.960]  It was during the pandemic and, you know, we had we had just
[04:13.960 --> 04:16.780]  like middle of the pandemic, lost my father.
[04:16.780 --> 04:19.860]  And it was like my mom also just had a back surgery.
[04:20.940 --> 04:22.840]  And so she couldn't go anywhere.
[04:22.840 --> 04:25.720]  And her mind was just consumed with this garbage.
[04:26.140 --> 04:27.620]  And she couldn't get through anything.
[04:27.620 --> 04:31.420]  And so I was like, Mom, watch Survivor, like just down and watch Survivor.
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.420]  It's so fun.
[04:32.460 --> 04:35.980]  And it's such a good show for you because, you know, my mom was a hairstylist
[04:35.980 --> 04:39.500]  for forever, which is just a game of backstabbing people, you know?
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.820]  And my mom would my mom would get to the hair salon.
[04:44.820 --> 04:48.760]  And like when people's clients would come in,
[04:49.680 --> 04:51.820]  she would she would be the one scheduling them, right?
[04:51.880 --> 04:53.240]  She'd be the first chair.
[04:53.440 --> 04:55.800]  And so she would pick up the phone when the receptionist wasn't there.
[04:56.140 --> 05:00.560]  And she would schedule the clients for time when they're when they weren't there.
[05:01.020 --> 05:02.580]  And so they would show up.
[05:02.600 --> 05:04.640]  And my mom would be like, Oh, they're not here.
[05:04.720 --> 05:05.940]  You know, they do this all the time.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.540]  Why don't you just go ahead and sit in my chair?
[05:11.460 --> 05:14.680]  And so that's that's like where, you know, my I was like,
[05:14.680 --> 05:18.100]  OK, mom, you got to watch this show because this is this is just that on television.
[05:18.580 --> 05:19.340]  Right up your alley.
[05:19.680 --> 05:20.460]  Yeah, that's great.
[05:20.880 --> 05:22.260]  And I thought it's awesome.
[05:22.660 --> 05:26.000]  Yeah, I have a question regarding like someone who's watched the show.
[05:26.200 --> 05:29.660]  Was there a moment or experience that you anticipated as a viewer?
[05:29.800 --> 05:32.980]  Because Survivor has like all these things that you kind of expect to hit on
[05:32.980 --> 05:34.160]  if you're going to be on the show
[05:34.160 --> 05:37.080]  that still surprised you by how it felt as a player?
[05:37.440 --> 05:38.800]  Like you saw it coming.
[05:39.420 --> 05:40.220]  Yes. Yes.
[05:40.220 --> 05:45.700]  When you're sitting there, it feels very different when Geoff says
[05:46.380 --> 05:48.680]  and one of you is not going to make the jury.
[05:49.460 --> 05:53.480]  OK, because like when when you're at that, there's so in Survivor,
[05:53.540 --> 05:56.740]  there's a challenge where, you know, you're split into two tribes
[05:56.740 --> 06:01.840]  and the team that loses the tribe that loses the challenge goes to tribal.
[06:02.000 --> 06:05.080]  And that's the last person who's not going to make the jury,
[06:05.480 --> 06:09.060]  even though they've made the merge, which is like one step in the game.
[06:09.760 --> 06:14.000]  Stuff like that hits a lot harder when you're out there
[06:14.000 --> 06:16.660]  versus when you're sitting on your couch like, oh, someone doesn't make the jury.
[06:16.740 --> 06:17.200]  Like, who cares?
[06:17.580 --> 06:21.020]  But when it's you and you're looking down the line and you're looking at
[06:21.020 --> 06:24.540]  David with his gleaming muscles and you have to hold on to a thing
[06:24.540 --> 06:27.020]  and you're like, all right, well, I'm not winning the challenge.
[06:27.140 --> 06:29.060]  I hope that he wins the overall thing.
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.200]  It's like that type of stuff when he says, oh, you're going to have fried
[06:33.200 --> 06:36.760]  chicken and waffles and you haven't eaten in 16 days.
[06:36.760 --> 06:40.540]  You're like, you know, I had a croissant up until that point.
[06:40.600 --> 06:44.040]  I had one chocolate croissant and half a vegan doughnut, which, by the way,
[06:44.260 --> 06:47.160]  when they told me it was a vegan doughnut, I nearly was like,
[06:47.360 --> 06:49.200]  get Geoff to the island right now.
[06:51.200 --> 06:53.180]  Give me a real damn doughnut.
[06:54.840 --> 06:57.500]  But yeah, it was like, you know, that type of stuff
[06:57.500 --> 06:59.700]  when they're talking about what you're going to have this food.
[06:59.940 --> 07:05.680]  Dude, you haven't eaten in 12 days and you just want something to eat.
[07:05.680 --> 07:08.280]  And so the excitement that you see, even though you know
[07:08.280 --> 07:10.060]  these things are coming, is very real.
[07:10.160 --> 07:14.220]  And it's visceral for someone who's out there in a way that it just can't be
[07:14.220 --> 07:15.500]  for someone who's sitting on the couch.
[07:15.880 --> 07:18.660]  Yeah, that's such a the jury line is so interesting,
[07:18.800 --> 07:22.240]  because that's something that as a viewer, like I understand, like, oh, man,
[07:22.280 --> 07:23.940]  that sucks, I guess, like you're going home.
[07:24.020 --> 07:26.840]  But it doesn't the significance of because it's when you're watching it,
[07:26.860 --> 07:28.380]  it's all about winning, largely.
[07:28.580 --> 07:32.360]  So the idea that there's a stakes difference between how you lose
[07:32.900 --> 07:35.320]  is not present when you're not like feeling it
[07:35.320 --> 07:38.640]  and going through those emotions and trying your best to advance.
[07:39.220 --> 07:41.180]  When you think about it, you're if you're on the jury,
[07:41.340 --> 07:43.060]  you're on every episode, first of all.
[07:43.160 --> 07:46.840]  Sure. That is not something that I thought about until I was out there.
[07:47.400 --> 07:49.820]  Wait, if you're on the jury, you're going to be on every episode.
[07:49.980 --> 07:54.220]  But more importantly than that, you get like when he says
[07:54.220 --> 07:57.240]  you get to have a say in who wins the million dollars
[07:57.240 --> 07:59.120]  and who has the title of sole survivor.
[07:59.840 --> 08:01.820]  That doesn't mean anything to the audience.
[08:01.820 --> 08:04.620]  Yeah, but it does mean something to you when you're out there.
[08:04.720 --> 08:07.880]  You're one of eight people that gets to vote on who gets a milli.
[08:08.160 --> 08:11.580]  You're one of eight people that gets to vote who gets to win your season
[08:11.580 --> 08:13.540]  because it's your season, right? Yeah.
[08:13.660 --> 08:16.780]  And that goes into the voting, I think, more than the viewers would think, too.
[08:16.820 --> 08:21.760]  Like a lot of what I was voting for was who I wanted to make sure won the season
[08:22.520 --> 08:25.180]  because I didn't I wanted to make sure that we were represented
[08:25.180 --> 08:26.840]  by the right season winner.
[08:27.040 --> 08:30.000]  Sure. You know, like that that that matters a lot.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.740]  Yeah. Oh, that makes total sense.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.680]  That's so interesting.
[08:33.180 --> 08:33.740]  I'm curious.
[08:34.100 --> 08:36.620]  On the other end of it now, having played the game,
[08:36.780 --> 08:40.480]  has that changed your perception of previous seasons you've watched?
[08:41.040 --> 08:42.620]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[08:42.880 --> 08:48.820]  I extend a lot more respect for anyone who has played the game.
[08:49.300 --> 08:53.400]  And, you know, a lot of people are like, oh, oh, gosh, yes.
[08:54.480 --> 08:57.900]  What drives me nuts now that didn't before,
[08:57.900 --> 09:03.100]  and I was probably guilty of it before, was people saying, why would they do that?
[09:05.940 --> 09:07.560]  Why would they do that?
[09:08.020 --> 09:10.240]  How about answer the question?
[09:10.800 --> 09:12.380]  That's what drives me nuts.
[09:12.640 --> 09:16.220]  If you want to watch the show or any reality television show,
[09:16.500 --> 09:21.380]  stop assuming these people are stupid and start answering your question.
[09:21.540 --> 09:23.000]  Why would he do this?
[09:23.880 --> 09:25.700]  Oh, let me answer the question
[09:25.700 --> 09:28.720]  and I'll be a much better watcher of the television show,
[09:28.920 --> 09:33.720]  because by providing an answer that assumes the person isn't a moron,
[09:34.240 --> 09:37.280]  you're going to get better at your own mental strategy.
[09:37.560 --> 09:39.760]  What are the reasons this person could do this?
[09:39.900 --> 09:42.640]  People got mad at Bianca for telling Cedric that she lost her vote.
[09:43.120 --> 09:45.080]  OK, well, what would you have done in a situation?
[09:45.220 --> 09:47.320]  He voted out the person who lied to him the first time
[09:47.320 --> 09:49.520]  and the whole entire time he's talking about that for me.
[09:49.800 --> 09:51.400]  Why did you search Kyle's bag?
[09:51.720 --> 09:54.940]  Well, I wanted to show Camilla that I trusted her
[09:54.940 --> 09:57.700]  because we were going to work together throughout the rest of the game.
[09:58.020 --> 10:01.520]  You don't see the three hour conversation that Camilla and I had, right?
[10:01.680 --> 10:02.980]  You can't. You just can't.
[10:03.360 --> 10:08.080]  And so a lot of these what changed for me was I extend a lot more respect
[10:08.080 --> 10:10.900]  towards the people who have played games like this,
[10:11.480 --> 10:16.540]  knowing that a lot of stuff is just it just has to be left on the editing floor.
[10:16.620 --> 10:20.380]  We're talking about 1700 hours plus of footage, something like that.
[10:20.480 --> 10:22.340]  And only 13 hours get shown.
[10:22.340 --> 10:26.220]  That's and like, you know, another hour of that is just them showing cool animals
[10:26.220 --> 10:28.820]  and shit, a lot, a lot of snakes.
[10:29.060 --> 10:32.120]  And on my season, like 15 minutes of that was them just showing,
[10:32.340 --> 10:34.020]  you know, David and Joe's pets.
[10:34.280 --> 10:35.260]  Yeah, absolutely.
[10:35.780 --> 10:39.540]  Speaking of leaving stuff on the editing floor, how do you leave the emotions
[10:39.540 --> 10:42.900]  and the feelings on the island when you come back?
[10:42.900 --> 10:46.840]  Because now you're in this exclusive club, which you'll be in for the rest of your life.
[10:47.060 --> 10:50.500]  You know, the survivor club of I think there's less than 800 people
[10:50.500 --> 10:52.500]  that have played it across the entirety of it.
[10:52.780 --> 10:57.040]  And I assume that Survivor becomes a part of your life going forward
[10:57.480 --> 11:00.600]  and you're going to interact and deal with like Kyle, for example,
[11:00.800 --> 11:02.540]  who framed you very famously.
[11:03.220 --> 11:05.700]  How do you put that aside or leave that on the island
[11:05.700 --> 11:08.120]  and main like have a friendly relationship going forward?
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.100]  Or is that even possible?
[11:09.700 --> 11:11.440]  You don't leave it on the island.
[11:11.560 --> 11:13.020]  You have to work through the emotion.
[11:13.420 --> 11:16.580]  Yeah, you can't just like cut it off and then, oh, I'm fine.
[11:16.720 --> 11:18.420]  No, no, no. You got you got to work through that.
[11:18.420 --> 11:20.980]  You have to have the difficult conversation.
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.520]  You have to navigate that stuff.
[11:22.640 --> 11:26.160]  And and you have to, you know, work through your emotions
[11:26.160 --> 11:29.060]  and in a lot of different ways for me personally.
[11:29.340 --> 11:31.180]  And I think this is a personal journey for everyone.
[11:31.340 --> 11:34.840]  There are people and there are moments that are like unforgivable, right?
[11:35.020 --> 11:35.920]  Yeah, there are things.
[11:36.080 --> 11:38.420]  And that's part of the thing that you sign up for when you go out there.
[11:38.480 --> 11:39.840]  It's like, OK, that's just unforgivable.
[11:39.840 --> 11:42.320]  I'm never going to be friends with that person or talk to that person
[11:42.320 --> 11:43.440]  or be around that person.
[11:43.520 --> 11:44.760]  And that's the way it goes.
[11:45.360 --> 11:48.140]  And actually, my recommendation to people who are going to go out there
[11:48.140 --> 11:51.120]  is really continually remind yourself.
[11:51.900 --> 11:53.540]  You're never going to talk to these people again.
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.220]  Yeah. Try and play that way.
[11:56.460 --> 11:58.700]  And and and that doesn't mean don't get close to them.
[11:58.760 --> 12:01.100]  That means get close to them with the idea that you're never going to talk
[12:01.100 --> 12:03.080]  to these people again in the back of your mind always.
[12:03.260 --> 12:05.260]  And that's kind of what I did every every morning.
[12:05.340 --> 12:08.200]  If you go back and watch the show every morning, you will see me
[12:08.200 --> 12:10.560]  like opening my palms and closing my eyes.
[12:10.660 --> 12:13.060]  And I'm accepting my vibes from home.
[12:13.120 --> 12:15.020]  I told people from home, send me good vibes. Right.
[12:15.020 --> 12:18.200]  And I was accepting those vibes at sunrise every single morning.
[12:18.720 --> 12:23.300]  And what that really was for me was a reminder of why I was out there
[12:23.300 --> 12:26.100]  and who was important to me while I was out there.
[12:26.220 --> 12:29.680]  Those people back home are important to me now.
[12:31.260 --> 12:33.660]  How do I compartmentalize?
[12:33.780 --> 12:37.600]  I journaled my ass off when I got back. Right.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.360]  And while I was out there, when I got voted out of the game, I journaled a ton.
[12:41.560 --> 12:43.080]  I meditate every single day.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.840]  I do breathwork every single day.
[12:45.300 --> 12:50.320]  That stuff allows emotional processing, journaling, meditation, breathwork.
[12:50.440 --> 12:54.000]  That stuff allows for emotional processing in a really profound way
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.380]  because you're just taking that weight off of your head. Right.
[12:57.440 --> 13:00.200]  You're just moving a weight every time you do some meditation
[13:00.200 --> 13:01.920]  or some breathwork or journaling or whatever.
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.080]  You're removing that mental weight because you're downloading it into your journal
[13:07.080 --> 13:08.800]  or you're getting rid of it through your body.
[13:09.180 --> 13:11.640]  And then you have to have difficult conversations.
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.100]  You have to navigate really difficult conversations.
[13:14.320 --> 13:18.980]  Joe and I had a very difficult, very long conversation where we talked about
[13:18.980 --> 13:24.560]  why he decided to believe Kyle over me, why we had that bad day
[13:24.560 --> 13:30.100]  and why we didn't work it out and why he did the vote that he did.
[13:30.520 --> 13:35.980]  And on the other side of that is strength in connection
[13:35.980 --> 13:39.800]  that through that you can have a stronger connection.
[13:39.800 --> 13:42.480]  And I think Joe and I have a really strong connection.
[13:42.640 --> 13:43.680]  And Kyle and I do, too.
[13:43.860 --> 13:46.100]  You know, I'm super proud of the game that he played.
[13:46.140 --> 13:47.100]  He played an amazing game.
[13:48.540 --> 13:49.620]  Yeah. Yeah.
[13:49.700 --> 13:52.300]  And I'm a different dude when it comes to stuff like that, too.
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.080]  Like I understood what I was going out there to do.
[13:56.180 --> 14:00.220]  I think it's harder if you are maybe not as emotionally prepared,
[14:00.380 --> 14:02.180]  maybe don't have as many tools like that.
[14:02.220 --> 14:03.660]  That stuff tends to be harder.
[14:03.860 --> 14:06.220]  But I knew I was going out there to play a game.
[14:06.320 --> 14:09.120]  I knew the chances were that I was going to get fucked over.
[14:09.120 --> 14:11.820]  And sure, I was going to have to deal with that.
[14:13.240 --> 14:15.940]  And meanwhile, they put 18 of the coolest motherfuckers
[14:15.940 --> 14:18.460]  on planet Earth on a television show with me.
[14:18.600 --> 14:19.700]  And so it's like, OK, cool.
[14:19.840 --> 14:20.960]  I did lose.
[14:21.060 --> 14:24.440]  And now I'm also going to sacrifice being friends with someone like Joe Hunter.
[14:24.860 --> 14:29.260]  Like Joe is one of the coolest, sweetest, kindest, best dudes on planet Earth.
[14:29.400 --> 14:31.520]  And you're going to lose the show and lose a friendship.
[14:31.640 --> 14:33.700]  Like that doesn't make any sense to me personally.
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.500]  Well, I would I would imagine, too, the connections that you're making
[14:36.500 --> 14:38.520]  there are so intense and so real.
[14:38.520 --> 14:41.240]  I liken it to like going through basic training in the military,
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.280]  which I did when I was very young.
[14:42.660 --> 14:45.400]  You develop these intense bonds with people because you're together
[14:45.400 --> 14:48.680]  24 hours a day, which is like, I don't like, like,
[14:49.380 --> 14:51.480]  skipping like three years of a relationship.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.560]  Totally. Yeah, I would I would say it's more like each day
[14:55.560 --> 14:57.780]  is probably around half a year.
[14:58.120 --> 15:00.980]  OK, yeah, friendship in the in like the regular world.
[15:01.120 --> 15:05.840]  So then at the same time, 12 years is how long I feel like I've known Joe Hunter
[15:05.840 --> 15:08.260]  at the same time as you're getting closer
[15:08.260 --> 15:10.920]  and probably falling in love with these people to some degree
[15:10.920 --> 15:12.920]  and developing potentially lifelong friendships.
[15:13.060 --> 15:16.860]  You're also working against each other, knowing they're working against you.
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.440]  And that's just an environment that a person doesn't find themselves in
[15:20.440 --> 15:22.100]  throughout the course of their life.
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.620]  Typically, I think it must.
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.960]  Yeah, it's got to do a number on you emotionally.
[15:26.360 --> 15:27.220]  Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.620]  You there's I mean, there's you're provided a therapist from from CBS
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.280]  after the show, because there's again like there's a lot of processing
[15:34.280 --> 15:36.880]  that you have to do in order to understand like, OK, it's a game.
[15:37.200 --> 15:41.340]  I mean, when I came back, I was lingering around conversations
[15:41.340 --> 15:43.640]  the same way I would linger on conversations around camp.
[15:43.740 --> 15:45.360]  So instead of being like, all right, guys, bye.
[15:45.660 --> 15:46.940]  I'd be like, all right, guys, bye.
[15:47.180 --> 15:50.900]  And then I would like duck around the corner and, you know, put my ear.
[15:53.260 --> 15:57.400]  How long do you feel like normal, old, regular Shane again after coming back?
[15:57.440 --> 15:59.660]  So I imagine your relationship with food is different for a while, too.
[15:59.880 --> 16:02.260]  Oh, no, no, there's no there's no
[16:02.260 --> 16:04.820]  there is no feeling normal.
[16:06.540 --> 16:07.340]  Again, interesting.
[16:07.540 --> 16:09.980]  It's it's in your brain now, right?
[16:10.240 --> 16:12.940]  It's you know, don't someone said it to me the other day,
[16:12.960 --> 16:13.900]  and I can't remember who it was.
[16:13.960 --> 16:15.160]  I wish I could. It was so good.
[16:15.520 --> 16:19.100]  But you're you're going on Survivor.
[16:19.180 --> 16:20.360]  Your life is going to change.
[16:20.780 --> 16:23.340]  So if you like if you like everything about your life,
[16:23.340 --> 16:26.440]  if you don't want your life to change, don't go on Survivor.
[16:26.440 --> 16:27.220]  It's life changing.
[16:27.520 --> 16:30.600]  So there is the before time and there is the after time.
[16:30.600 --> 16:34.740]  Like, for example, I used to go by Shah with a lot of my friends,
[16:34.900 --> 16:38.520]  like people that knew me even when I was a college, like at the college.
[16:40.200 --> 16:44.160]  And I when I came back after 30, you know, 30 something days total.
[16:44.800 --> 16:47.880]  The only thing that I ever told production my name was was Shaheen.
[16:48.000 --> 16:51.780]  I never told them that I went by Shah because I didn't want to be called Shah.
[16:51.920 --> 16:53.220]  I wanted to be called Shaheen.
[16:53.280 --> 16:54.320]  It mattered to me culturally.
[16:54.400 --> 16:57.260]  It was important to me to be called Shaheen out there.
[16:58.420 --> 17:01.520]  And when I came back and my friends, you know,
[17:01.560 --> 17:04.720]  that had been calling me that for a long time, called me that again, I was like,
[17:04.820 --> 17:06.380]  it was like nails on a chalkboard all of a sudden.
[17:06.560 --> 17:09.480]  Oh, whoa, don't I can't be that guy anymore.
[17:09.600 --> 17:11.600]  That guy is gone for sure.
[17:13.360 --> 17:16.440]  And, you know, Shaheen has risen from the ashes, if you will.
[17:17.260 --> 17:18.920]  So, yeah, your life is going to change.
[17:18.940 --> 17:20.240]  My relationship with food is different.
[17:20.440 --> 17:25.380]  There's many times now where it's like, I'm hungry and I just don't need to eat.
[17:25.380 --> 17:26.880]  Yeah, I'm hungry.
[17:27.160 --> 17:28.980]  I don't need to eat.
[17:29.220 --> 17:31.860]  And so if I'm in the middle of something creative, for example,
[17:32.520 --> 17:35.860]  I'm just not going to eat because I don't want to ruin my creative flow.
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.380]  Or if I'm doing something that requires my full attention and I feel hungry,
[17:39.420 --> 17:40.880]  I can just kind of push that aside.
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.260]  And hangry used to be a constant emotion for me.
[17:44.360 --> 17:47.440]  Now it's it takes like four or five days for me to get hangry.
[17:47.880 --> 17:50.260]  Well, we could talk endlessly with you about survival.
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.360]  I would like to. Yes.
[17:51.560 --> 17:54.080]  Yeah, we should circle back again some other time.
[17:55.380 --> 17:57.180]  I'd love to hit you with some regulation questions.
[17:57.520 --> 17:58.200]  Yes, hit me.
[17:58.560 --> 17:59.360]  End of the thing.
[18:00.040 --> 18:02.400]  Were we the oddest ruling you gave as a judge?
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.860]  Oh, did certainly by far the most odd request
[18:07.860 --> 18:10.140]  that hired judge has ever received.
[18:10.540 --> 18:13.000]  No doubt about it.
[18:13.180 --> 18:13.540]  Yes.
[18:14.380 --> 18:18.500]  Let's say if someone was to go on an Australian news show
[18:18.500 --> 18:20.820]  and they've been doing something for like 17 years,
[18:21.300 --> 18:24.200]  do you think it's a lazy question to ask how they started
[18:24.200 --> 18:26.180]  when they've talked about it extensively?
[18:28.500 --> 18:30.060]  Yes. Thank you.
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.180]  Thank you very much.
[18:31.460 --> 18:32.440]  Yes, I do.
[18:32.480 --> 18:35.360]  It's not knowing the shift key capitalizes hard to believe.
[18:36.860 --> 18:38.460]  That's impossible to believe.
[18:38.740 --> 18:40.500]  Yeah. At what age?
[18:41.280 --> 18:42.540]  How old are you, Andrew?
[18:42.880 --> 18:44.620]  30? Let's say 30.
[18:44.620 --> 18:46.660]  No fucking shot, dude. I don't believe that.
[18:46.740 --> 18:47.560]  29. I don't believe that.
[18:47.660 --> 18:49.700]  I don't believe that for a second.
[18:50.380 --> 18:52.840]  Would extra medium be just medium or large?
[18:54.960 --> 18:55.760]  Extra medium?
[18:56.080 --> 18:56.320]  Yes.
[18:57.580 --> 18:58.340]  Just medium.
[18:58.660 --> 18:59.680]  OK, wow.
[19:00.020 --> 19:00.720]  Excellent answer.
[19:01.040 --> 19:01.140]  Thank you.
[19:01.140 --> 19:02.200]  Is eating in the bathtub weird?
[19:03.840 --> 19:07.240]  No, what a delight, what a delightful treat for yourself.
[19:08.540 --> 19:10.640]  I was going to ask, should I still have to eat the pencil?
[19:10.740 --> 19:11.540]  I feel like we've covered that.
[19:11.620 --> 19:12.720]  We know your stance on it.
[19:13.260 --> 19:14.840]  Yes, eat the pencil, damn it.
[19:15.720 --> 19:17.340]  Would you consider...
[19:17.340 --> 19:20.120]  Your 80 year old self is so bummed that you're not a manager.
[19:25.260 --> 19:27.660]  Would you consider a pigeon an exotic bird?
[19:28.980 --> 19:30.900]  No, it feels very unexotic.
[19:31.040 --> 19:33.400]  It feels like the antithesis of exotic.
[19:33.720 --> 19:35.520]  You're doing fantastic on these questions, by the way.
[19:35.760 --> 19:37.080]  Yeah, 10 out of 10.
[19:38.160 --> 19:39.460]  Are tail syncs necessary?
[19:39.640 --> 19:41.680]  So when we record, you know what a tail sync is for recording?
[19:42.200 --> 19:42.500]  No.
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.140]  OK, so we do a front sync where we count five, four, three, two, one.
[19:46.180 --> 19:49.020]  And then at the end, we do the same to make sure there's no audio drift.
[19:49.480 --> 19:50.360]  Do you think they're necessary?
[19:50.720 --> 19:52.200]  Do you think... Are you OK with them?
[19:54.720 --> 19:56.940]  No, I fucking hate tail syncs.
[19:56.960 --> 19:57.900]  All right, well, that was a rough one.
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.460]  Nobody's perfect.
[19:59.680 --> 20:00.900]  Tail syncs are insane.
[20:01.040 --> 20:02.880]  Why would we ever? I have no idea, guys.
[20:02.980 --> 20:03.680]  Sure. Yes.
[20:04.080 --> 20:06.760]  And my last regulation question.
[20:07.200 --> 20:09.600]  Is this a condiment or a recipe to make a side?
[20:10.340 --> 20:13.280]  Sprinkle hot tater tots with a light dusting of chili powder,
[20:13.540 --> 20:17.520]  then combine pepper jack cheese with crisped up cubed pancetta,
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.060]  hard sauteed diced onions and thinly sliced chives.
[20:21.500 --> 20:22.880]  Pour over the tots. Done.
[20:25.020 --> 20:27.140]  And that's supposed to be a condiment?
[20:27.300 --> 20:28.320]  That's a whole ass meal.
[20:28.680 --> 20:29.880]  Thank you. Thank you.
[20:30.180 --> 20:31.180]  Thank you so much.
[20:31.380 --> 20:34.080]  It fits the dictionary definition of the word condiment, but OK.
[20:36.040 --> 20:38.780]  Just because you put it on top of something.
[20:38.940 --> 20:40.820]  It's like, OK, yeah, take a pizza.
[20:41.060 --> 20:43.640]  A chutney is a condiment and it's full of stuff.
[20:44.540 --> 20:45.760]  Fuck off. What are you talking about?
[20:48.520 --> 20:49.880]  Well, that's fair.
[20:49.960 --> 20:51.700]  Hey, you're a hired judge, so.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.000]  You're absolutely hired judge.
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.460]  I think you should be the judge of all debates on our show.
[20:56.540 --> 20:58.620]  I think you should be the one that makes the definitive ruling.
[20:59.440 --> 21:01.840]  Shane, it's been so wonderful to talk with you.
[21:01.900 --> 21:02.780]  We need to do this again.
[21:03.200 --> 21:03.900]  This is amazing.
[21:04.360 --> 21:07.840]  It was also, let me just say, wonderful to watch you on Survivor.
[21:07.880 --> 21:10.000]  Yes. Fantastic contestant.
[21:10.280 --> 21:11.240]  You were exciting.
[21:11.440 --> 21:15.260]  And it would have been the worst if we had this relationship with you
[21:16.060 --> 21:19.240]  tangentially and then you were a turd on TV.
[21:19.400 --> 21:19.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:20.080 --> 21:21.580]  And that was just not the case.
[21:21.580 --> 21:22.960]  You were delightful from day one.
[21:23.060 --> 21:24.980]  I mean, it was a lot of fun to watch you.
[21:24.980 --> 21:26.540]  Oh, man, that means so much to me.
[21:26.620 --> 21:30.300]  And honestly, like the Regulation podcast listeners have been out
[21:30.300 --> 21:32.080]  in full force in support.
[21:32.280 --> 21:36.260]  It felt really cool to see them popping up all over the place and talking shit
[21:36.260 --> 21:38.320]  to Kyle and my co-hosts.
[21:39.960 --> 21:43.580]  It's it's been like Kyle sending me screenshots of Regulation
[21:43.580 --> 21:47.040]  listeners talking shit to him is hysterical to me.
[21:47.400 --> 21:50.460]  And and he's you know, he's he's he's a good natured dude about all that stuff.
[21:50.460 --> 21:54.560]  But I wanted to like do something special for the Regulation listeners, too.
[21:54.760 --> 21:57.820]  So if you go to my website, ShaheenDivari.com
[21:57.820 --> 22:01.300]  and you use the promo code pencil, you will get 20% off.
[22:01.360 --> 22:02.240]  Absolutely anything.
[22:02.820 --> 22:05.640]  I have a course that I am launching.
[22:05.840 --> 22:07.360]  It's coming out July 30th.
[22:07.360 --> 22:09.140]  It's a four week course every Wednesday night
[22:09.140 --> 22:11.420]  because you don't have anything to do because Survivor's not on television.
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.200]  Right. 5.30pm to 7.30pm.
[22:14.460 --> 22:16.500]  And basically it's Pacific Standard Time.
[22:16.880 --> 22:19.720]  And it's a course that's just going to improve communication skills.
[22:20.220 --> 22:23.180]  Everything from public speaking to interpersonal communication
[22:23.180 --> 22:25.420]  and your communication with yourself.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.160]  Find your voice, heal your voice, use your voice.
[22:28.280 --> 22:34.000]  That's kind of my ethos behind how to become an expert communicator,
[22:34.120 --> 22:35.900]  how to become a super communicator.
[22:36.500 --> 22:38.700]  And that will make your life a lot easier.
[22:38.920 --> 22:40.340]  It doesn't matter what it is you're doing.
[22:40.440 --> 22:42.540]  If you have an interview coming up, if you have a wedding coming up,
[22:42.560 --> 22:43.720]  it doesn't matter what it is you're doing.
[22:43.780 --> 22:46.320]  If you can communicate better, your life just gets easier.
[22:46.320 --> 22:52.300]  And so promo code PENCIL, all caps for the regulation pod.
[22:52.360 --> 22:55.160]  And you get 20% off anything on my website, including the course.
[22:55.780 --> 22:57.000]  We will send everybody your way.
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.140]  Thank you so much for doing that. That's beyond kind of you.
[22:59.380 --> 23:00.340]  Yeah, of course. Are you kidding?
[23:01.240 --> 23:03.580]  The support has been pretty unreal, guys.
[23:03.660 --> 23:08.360]  I got to be honest, like a 30 second clip that I had on your podcast years ago.
[23:08.840 --> 23:12.860]  The fact that that many people have come out of the woodwork was was pretty hysterical.
[23:13.100 --> 23:14.860]  I just giggle every single time.
[23:14.860 --> 23:15.960]  And yeah, yeah, man.
[23:15.980 --> 23:19.100]  And you really should eat the pencil like you're just, you know, think about it.
[23:19.380 --> 23:22.280]  You know, you're when you're when you're maybe if you win the game,
[23:22.540 --> 23:23.860]  I'll eat, I'll eat the pencil. Wow.
[23:25.240 --> 23:27.900]  Oh, man. I have to get invited back first.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.760]  That's true. We'll see. We'll see how that goes.
[23:29.840 --> 23:32.320]  I'd love to. I'd love to go out there and play that game.
[23:32.740 --> 23:33.700]  Well, did you go play?
[23:34.120 --> 23:34.980]  Would you ever go play?
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.320]  Oh, I don't know.
[23:37.520 --> 23:39.900]  It was something I considered, but it was, you know,
[23:39.900 --> 23:42.240]  they didn't allow Canadians to play for such a long time.
[23:42.240 --> 23:46.060]  So it was sort of like I was at peace with as far as deciding.
[23:46.220 --> 23:48.000]  I don't know. I'd have to really think about it.
[23:48.480 --> 23:49.940]  You should apply. Be fun to watch you out there.
[23:50.060 --> 23:51.560]  I think the regulation listeners would go.
[23:51.660 --> 23:54.040]  Absolutely. I completely agree.
[23:54.160 --> 23:55.540]  I support this. I think you should do it, Andrew.
[23:56.020 --> 24:00.900]  I would tell I would tell Geoff to make sure that one of the rewards was a pencil.
[24:01.480 --> 24:03.120]  Oh, we doing blind auction?
[24:03.480 --> 24:04.960]  We doing the auction lifting the thing?
[24:05.120 --> 24:05.980]  Yeah. Oh my God.
[24:06.000 --> 24:07.840]  Could you imagine the television
[24:08.680 --> 24:12.360]  bringing out one singular pencil under a fucking thing?
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.160]  Yeah, I don't know what it is.
[24:14.280 --> 24:16.500]  Yeah. Well, this has been so wonderful to speak with you.
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.200]  We got to sync up again. This is amazing.
[24:18.280 --> 24:19.840]  Thank you so much for your time, Sheen.
[24:20.160 --> 24:21.300]  Pleasure. Thank you so much.
[24:21.980 --> 24:23.060]  Absolutely. Your day.
[24:23.240 --> 24:24.080]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[24:24.260 --> 24:27.620]  Of course, I love the name change, but I also really enjoyed
[24:27.620 --> 24:29.300]  the previous name of the podcast.
[24:30.660 --> 24:34.140]  It would have been hilarious if that was in the comments every five seconds.
[24:34.160 --> 24:35.860]  Oh, I understand the name change.
[24:35.860 --> 24:41.520]  That podcast was a lot easier to do under the umbrella of a much larger corporation.
[24:42.120 --> 24:42.440]  Yeah.
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.000]  We no longer have the cover.
[24:44.440 --> 24:46.780]  Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. I get it.
[24:46.840 --> 24:48.420]  All right, friends. Thank you so much for the interview.
[24:48.520 --> 24:50.420]  Thank you so much for the time and for organizing all this, man.
[24:50.480 --> 24:51.840]  This has been absolutely so good.
[24:52.320 --> 24:52.800]  Talk to you later.
[24:53.220 --> 24:53.520]  Bye, man.
[24:53.540 --> 24:54.340]  Take it easy. Bye.
