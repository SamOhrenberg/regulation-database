[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  The fibula is an important bone.
[00:02.240 --> 00:04.120]  Do, uh, women really have one less rib?
[00:04.400 --> 00:05.980]  The ribs are below the heart, aren't they?
[00:06.240 --> 00:07.060]  What's below your collarbone?
[00:07.740 --> 00:09.440]  Uh, like a breastplate?
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.560]  The ribs go all the way up!
[00:12.280 --> 00:13.600]  Man... Thumb is like...
[00:13.600 --> 00:16.660]  It's a finger, but it's not a finger, right? Doesn't it have a different name?
[00:16.880 --> 00:18.300]  Thumb? Where's your hip?
[00:18.640 --> 00:20.020]  Oh, it's on... it's uh...
[00:20.020 --> 00:22.040]  I don't know how to say it outside of my hip.
[00:22.260 --> 00:23.440]  A woman's pelvis is pretty different.
[00:24.200 --> 00:24.980]  It's got one less rib.
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.940]  Your brain is on the inside.
[00:27.940 --> 00:28.960]  Yeah.
[00:29.340 --> 00:31.380]  So your skeleton's outside of where you are.
[00:32.300 --> 00:33.780]  Well, I'm uh...
[00:33.780 --> 00:35.120]  I measure at the skin.
