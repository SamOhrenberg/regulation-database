[00:00.000 --> 00:03.400]  I'm not scared of, like, a grape being dropped on me from the Empire State Building.
[00:04.340 --> 00:05.140]  A grape?
[00:05.400 --> 00:07.580]  Yeah, like something small and absorbable.
[00:08.400 --> 00:09.660]  Like a kiwi fruit.
[00:10.400 --> 00:11.720]  Like, I know the velocity.
[00:11.740 --> 00:13.620]  A kiwi would be much worse than a grape.
[00:13.940 --> 00:14.980]  They're both small.
[00:15.140 --> 00:16.760]  They're both, like, in my head, it's no problem.
[00:17.240 --> 00:19.840]  I can catch a grape in my mouth from the Empire State.
[00:19.920 --> 00:21.500]  A kiwi would go through my face.
[00:21.880 --> 00:24.800]  I think they would both do a lot of damage realistically,
[00:24.980 --> 00:26.540]  but because it's so small.
[00:26.960 --> 00:27.700]  A grape?
[00:27.700 --> 00:28.960]  Yeah, because of the speed.
[00:28.980 --> 00:30.660]  What's the terminal velocity of a grape?
[00:30.780 --> 00:31.780]  Like, 20 miles an hour?
[00:32.320 --> 00:34.440]  Well, wait, does it max out?
[00:36.420 --> 00:37.180]  Well, yeah.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.460]  What's the max speed of a grape?
[00:41.620 --> 00:44.600]  I feel like you could throw a grape faster than you could drop one.
