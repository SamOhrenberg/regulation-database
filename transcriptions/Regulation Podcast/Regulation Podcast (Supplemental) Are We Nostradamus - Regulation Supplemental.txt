[00:00.000 --> 00:09.420]  Hello and welcome to Are We Nostradamus? Our official regulation 2025 predictions draft.
[00:09.860 --> 00:14.340]  We are going to sit down and over the next 30 minutes to however long we argue with each other,
[00:14.440 --> 00:21.780]  we're going to make four predictions each, draft style, snake draft style, about things that are
[00:21.780 --> 00:27.940]  going to happen in the year 2025. Then we'll live that year out, normal style like everybody does,
[00:27.940 --> 00:34.040]  living in the moment as they say. In 2026, which is about a year from now, we're going to reconvene,
[00:34.120 --> 00:39.500]  we're going to go over these and we're going to determine were we Nostradamus? I'm going to guess
[00:39.500 --> 00:44.900]  yes. You'll have to wait a year to find out. Is everybody ready? Or who is the most Nostradamus
[00:44.900 --> 00:49.800]  of all of us? Who's the most Nostradamus? That's a good point too. We could all potentially be
[00:49.800 --> 00:56.320]  Nostradamus. It's just about who is the most Nostradamus of us. The most Nostradamus. Who's
[00:56.320 --> 01:01.340]  the most Nostradamus of us? Yeah, the most Nostradamus. Oh, interesting. Who's our Nostradamus?
[01:01.820 --> 01:06.040]  Now, I would like to say from the upfront, just as really quickly, I have no insider knowledge
[01:06.040 --> 01:14.140]  on any of my picks. This is all from the heart. This is all me, statistical data. I am just
[01:14.140 --> 01:21.320]  tapping into percentages and or just the realities of the world. I hate this. I don't like, I don't
[01:21.320 --> 01:28.080]  like the way he teed all that up. Yeah, we are doing this on our regular draft board just to
[01:28.080 --> 01:34.580]  be able to keep track of it, which means we have the opportunity to randomize names. What? I was
[01:34.580 --> 01:41.860]  just going randomize as some background support vocals on that. It's nice. It helps. It makes the
[01:41.860 --> 01:49.060]  production feel layered. Appreciate it. Yeah. So how many times do we want to randomize or do we
[01:49.060 --> 01:56.480]  want to maintain an ANAG order? 25. Okay. I was thinking 11. Why is it 25? Because it's 2025.
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.580]  Did you guys all think that? No. Yes. Well, me and Nick did apparently. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
[02:03.680 --> 02:11.660]  8, 9, 10. Andrew, Eric, Gavin, Geoff, Nick. 1, 2, 3, that's 16, 17, 18, oh 16, that's right, I forgot
[02:11.660 --> 02:18.220]  about that. Here's 21. Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Geoff. Love it. I like it. Give me the first one,
[02:18.220 --> 02:25.820]  I really don't want to be in a swing. All I want is to not be a swing. Don't make me last. 24. 24
[02:25.820 --> 02:30.640]  is Gavin, Andrew, Geoff, Eric, Nick. Put me in the middle. Geoff, you think you'll be in the middle?
[02:31.520 --> 02:37.780]  I'm in the middle right now. Gagging order, we'll see. I don't think so. And here we go. Gavin,
[02:38.180 --> 02:45.260]  Nick, Andrew, Geoff, Eric. That is the official order for Are We No Stress Domus. And now it's
[02:45.260 --> 02:52.120]  time for our picks. Gavin, you have the very first prediction for the year 2025. Well, I want
[02:52.120 --> 03:00.040]  to be the most Stradamus, obviously. So what on my list is the most absolute certainty of anything
[03:00.040 --> 03:08.120]  that could happen? And I've got to go with Andrew breaks a chair. Oh, I don't like that one. I don't
[03:08.120 --> 03:13.100]  like that one. And we know it's like a September incident, isn't it? Isn't that when it takes place?
[03:13.100 --> 03:19.740]  Second or third week of September. Yeah, that's really good. That's a problem for me. There goes
[03:19.740 --> 03:25.960]  my first pick. Dang. Wow. I don't like that. Oh, I don't like this at all. You know what? Once again,
[03:26.460 --> 03:32.300]  I'm only feeling better about my picks. I see what you're throwing at me. I mean, you. Yeah.
[03:34.080 --> 03:39.300]  You're willing it into the universe. I don't like it. I don't like it. Wow. It's happened every
[03:39.300 --> 03:43.080]  year without fail the entire time we've done this. It's fair. It's fair. I just don't like it
[03:43.080 --> 03:47.940]  on the board. I don't like seeing it first thing overall. I'm not a fan of it. OK, that's Gavin's
[03:47.940 --> 03:51.520]  first prediction. Nick, what is your first prediction for 2025? Well, we've been playing
[03:51.520 --> 03:58.280]  a certain game a lot lately and we're big fans of it. And we've been anticipating the next release
[03:58.280 --> 04:03.600]  in said series. However, while it is scheduled to come out this year, I do believe that Grand
[04:03.600 --> 04:09.260]  Theft Auto 6 will be delayed until at least 2026. It's scheduled to come out next year, isn't it?
[04:09.260 --> 04:15.000]  They said 2025, but it's so obviously going to delay it. Yeah. Yep. I'm here to win, baby. There
[04:15.000 --> 04:23.580]  you go. GTA 6 delayed to 2026. That is your 2025 prediction. Interesting. Andrew. I appreciate
[04:23.580 --> 04:29.380]  that we're all here to win, it appears so far. We're all going with certainties that we believe
[04:29.380 --> 04:34.600]  in. I don't believe it. First of all, I want to be clear. I'm not hoping for this. I'm trying to
[04:34.600 --> 04:38.760]  win this game. This is about predicting the future. Geoff, you might want to brace yourself, I feel.
[04:39.720 --> 04:46.720]  Statistical percentages. My first prediction is, because all four of you apply to this category,
[04:47.280 --> 04:55.500]  I think one of you four is going to get divorced in the year 2025. Marriages have a 50% success
[04:55.500 --> 05:04.080]  rate on the US on average. I'm not pulling for it, but statistically speaking, it seems possible.
[05:04.680 --> 05:10.040]  You said you didn't have any insider info, but now that... who have you been talking to lately?
[05:10.240 --> 05:15.120]  Just out of curiosity? We're playing a dangerous game all of a sudden. I haven't been talking to
[05:15.120 --> 05:21.920]  anybody. I'm just looking at the data. I'm floored. Regulation divorce in 2025. That's
[05:21.920 --> 05:28.100]  your opening pick. That's my first pick, because it's 50%. And I don't want it for any of you. I
[05:28.100 --> 05:33.420]  want to be clear. I don't want this to be accurate, but if I'm trying to win... No, yeah, you do.
[05:33.420 --> 05:38.380]  You do want it to be accurate. Yes, you do. No, I do want it. There's two separate things. No,
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.320]  you absolutely want it to happen. No, because if you want to win, you want it to happen.
[05:41.620 --> 05:46.080]  There's two separate things. This pick is so evil, I'm holding your feet to the fire.
[05:46.600 --> 05:51.280]  Dude, there's two. You want it to happen, because it is your... shut up. It's your first pick.
[05:51.540 --> 05:59.120]  You made this your first pick. Who else was going to pick that? You said statistically,
[05:59.120 --> 06:04.800]  this is the one that you feel strongest about. This is the one, and you're saying,
[06:04.900 --> 06:09.760]  oh, I don't want it to happen. I don't want it to happen. Yes, you do, because you said you came
[06:09.760 --> 06:16.420]  to win. You said that you want to win. You want it to happen. I'm playing this game as a man of
[06:16.420 --> 06:24.340]  heartless statistics. Andrew, the person, does not want it to happen. Just because he thinks it'll
[06:24.340 --> 06:30.500]  happen, doesn't mean he wants it to happen. Yeah. Yes, he... this is insane. But I don't. No,
[06:30.560 --> 06:34.600]  he doesn't want it to happen, but he's just saying it's very... it's 50% likely to. But I
[06:34.600 --> 06:39.180]  have to acknowledge the statistics, and if I'm making predictions... He wants it to happen,
[06:39.400 --> 06:47.820]  because he made it his first pick. I don't think it matters where I pick it. He said that he came
[06:47.820 --> 06:55.520]  to win. He's picking the thing that he thinks is going to happen. Yeah, he thinks it is going to
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.880]  happen, but he doesn't want it to happen. Yeah, I'm not even... I don't even... Statistically
[06:59.880 --> 07:06.420]  speaking, it's more likely than not. Well, I don't want Andrew to break his chair. You are making it
[07:06.420 --> 07:11.980]  your first pick. You want it to happen. I don't. You are. I want all you guys to be happy. I'll
[07:11.980 --> 07:16.840]  tell you what, if it happens, it's not going to be great for this podcast. Nope. No, I agree.
[07:16.840 --> 07:24.100]  That's like saying, Eric, that Nick wants GTA to get delayed. No, no, no. What I'm saying is what
[07:24.100 --> 07:31.900]  Andrew said. Andrew said that he came to win. He said that statistically, this is the strongest.
[07:32.600 --> 07:37.620]  He said that he wants to win this. Based on data. Right, which implies that you want it. He wants
[07:37.620 --> 07:43.280]  it. He's putting it out there. I'm making the tough predictions. He just thinks it's the most
[07:43.280 --> 07:49.560]  likely thing to happen out of all his predictions. Right. And he came to win because he wants this.
[07:49.780 --> 07:54.560]  This is what I'm saying. I'm saying I'm willing to be bold enough to pick it because it is
[07:54.560 --> 08:00.860]  statistically wild. I'm not. I'm not relenting on this. This is the craziest thing you could
[08:00.860 --> 08:06.820]  have picked. It's 50 percent. And then, you know, we don't need to go deeper. This is going to make
[08:06.820 --> 08:16.540]  my pick a lot seem to seem really insignificant in comparison. Yeah, mine too! I said yesterday I had some spice on my predictions.
[08:19.720 --> 08:24.300]  That's that's insanely spicy. That's Carolina Reaper. There's some Scoville on the board.
[08:24.760 --> 08:33.060]  Yeah, crazy, crazy. Punches in the mouth with capsaicin. Wow. Where's the milk? Oh, God.
[08:33.180 --> 08:36.680]  We'll turn it around. It's fine. Listen, I got pick two lined up. All right, Geoff.
[08:36.820 --> 08:43.800]  Follow that. You see why I didn't want to be a swing? Yeah, I could die. I wanted to. I wanted
[08:43.800 --> 08:48.000]  to come up with some really good predictions for y'all. Some things that I think are have a better
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.540]  than average chance of happening. I consulted with a local oracle and then I cross referenced that
[08:54.540 --> 09:03.840]  with a hired a local diviner and got together, had a little quorum. And we think that the most likely
[09:03.840 --> 09:10.040]  outcome of 2025, I think swing music is going to become it's annoying. It's going to enter into
[09:10.040 --> 09:13.860]  its annoying comeback. Yeah, we're going to have to deal with that shit again. It's going to be
[09:13.860 --> 09:19.120]  like a cherry pop and daddy's phase somewhere, somewhere briefly for about three months in 2025.
[09:19.220 --> 09:25.820]  That's my prediction. Wow, that's crazy, dude. I don't want swing music back. It happened in 98.
[09:26.180 --> 09:30.380]  Yeah, could happen again. I just feel like the cycle's coming around. Also, my prediction on
[09:30.380 --> 09:34.300]  Andrew breaking the chair, I got it down to the month. I think it's going to happen in October.
[09:34.720 --> 09:37.600]  Oh, it's going to be late this year. I don't like it. It's pretty good. Oh,
[09:37.600 --> 09:41.140]  it's going to be late this year. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's being more careful.
[09:44.900 --> 09:48.780]  Standing desk September. He better be careful. He's making some fucking enemies in this podcast.
[09:48.980 --> 09:53.640]  Yeah. What do you mean enemies? Yeah, no kidding. Not me. I like you. I'm defending you. I'm talking
[09:53.640 --> 09:58.440]  about the other ones, the ones that have their knives out. Jesus. I came to win. Here's the
[09:58.440 --> 10:02.620]  thing that I think is going to happen right on based on statistical data that I have nothing
[10:02.620 --> 10:08.540]  to do with. Here's my pick. GTA six releases this year. Oh, hell yeah. I like that one a lot.
[10:08.680 --> 10:14.820]  That's a good pick. Yeah, me too. You see how this is fun. You see how it's a fun thing. I'm
[10:14.820 --> 10:22.280]  cheering for that one. You're not going to like my next pick then. Oh, my God. And we know
[10:22.280 --> 10:27.060]  somebody is going to be right here. Nick or Eric is going to be a little most redundancy. Yeah,
[10:27.060 --> 10:31.000]  either Nick or Eric will get a point. I like the contrast. Yeah, that's guaranteed points.
[10:31.500 --> 10:36.760]  That bumps the Nick picking that their bump mine up to my first pick there. That was way lower on
[10:36.760 --> 10:42.300]  my list. I think that's a long shot one, but I feel like if Nick picked it first, I got to pick
[10:42.300 --> 10:48.000]  the opposite first. I think that's fun. I love it. That's a great pick, Eric. Boy, I want to pick no
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.140]  divorce in twenty twenty five, but I'm just I'm not even good. I just don't want to get near
[10:53.140 --> 10:59.820]  anything like that. I just don't. I don't like it. I don't want anything to do with it. I don't like
[10:59.820 --> 11:06.740]  it either. Why? What do you know? I is. Yeah. Do you have some insider info? You've been talking
[11:06.740 --> 11:15.940]  to God. Well, I am going to go out on a limb. This is one that I don't know that I feel super
[11:15.940 --> 11:25.120]  strongly about, but I'm being inundated with it still. And it's that the movie Better Man came out
[11:25.780 --> 11:32.380]  starring Robbie Williams as a monkey. And I think Robbie Williams will die in twenty twenty five.
[11:32.700 --> 11:41.400]  I feel like this was I think it's too coincidental. He was too in the zeitgeist in a time where he
[11:41.400 --> 11:47.200]  didn't necessarily need to be. That's almost a tempting of fate, like saying that your friends
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.740]  would get divorced this year in a fun game that, you know, it's just it's tempting fate too much.
[11:52.740 --> 11:58.600]  And it's it's just it's playing with fire. He's only like 50 or something. Yes. But he was he
[11:58.600 --> 12:03.400]  didn't even be the monkey in the movie. Yeah. He didn't even sing them. Oh, no, he didn't even sing
[12:03.400 --> 12:08.140]  the monkey. He didn't be the monkey. He didn't. Not Robbie Williams. Why didn't you be the monkey
[12:08.140 --> 12:13.060]  in the movie? That's what I'm saying. It makes sense. He didn't be the monkey in the movie.
[12:13.420 --> 12:17.820]  There you go. So I think Robbie Williams this year will die. Didn't Robbie Williams have an
[12:17.820 --> 12:26.500]  entire album that was swing music? Did he? Oh, wow. Maybe that's his last act. Wow. So when he dies,
[12:26.560 --> 12:30.160]  it'll bring back swing music. And then and then somebody takes him out the game.
[12:32.420 --> 12:39.080]  That's wild. Wow. Robbie Williams had swing when you're winning. Yeah.
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.140]  Sounds like something else. See, it's already started. The swing comebacks already begun.
[12:44.520 --> 12:48.840]  Yeah, but that was like 20 years ago. Man. Yeah. So was Robbie Williams. What we're talking about
[12:48.840 --> 12:53.600]  in 2025. I'm telling you, he wasn't even the monkey in the movie, dude. Geoff. Insane. That
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.520]  is that's the first death prediction we've had on this board. What are you feeling?
[12:58.520 --> 13:05.260]  Allow me to be a little ray of sunshine in these days, in this dismal prediction landscape.
[13:06.040 --> 13:11.880]  I'm going to go the exact opposite direction that Eric has gone with Robbie Williams dying.
[13:12.280 --> 13:16.000]  I don't know if you guys are aware of this, but if he lives to December 13th,
[13:16.680 --> 13:24.180]  2025, Dick Van Dyke will turn 100 years old in 2025. I predict that Dick Van Dyke lives through
[13:24.180 --> 13:30.580]  2025 and makes it to the ripe old age of 100. I predict Dick Van Dyke won't die.
[13:30.780 --> 13:34.580]  So then he's not a failure. Yeah. He has a full life. Dick Van Dyke will succeed.
[13:34.820 --> 13:38.140]  Yeah. Like my friend Andrew Douglas says, he will have lived a full life.
[13:38.380 --> 13:43.000]  Full life. How does he feel about people that live 101? Is that like house money life?
[13:43.140 --> 13:49.940]  Like what is that? I think he called it bonus years. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I love that.
[13:49.940 --> 13:56.100]  Yeah. There you go. And I arrived at that, by the way, I hired a local profit and then
[13:57.160 --> 14:03.060]  I did like a VPN thing or not a VPN. What do you call it? Like an online thing?
[14:04.060 --> 14:09.200]  I had some Zoom meetings. I'm not a tech guy. I had some Zoom meetings with a mystic.
[14:09.980 --> 14:13.840]  That's what we came up with. And the mystic thought that you're located in Brazil. You really
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.700]  tricked them. I don't connect directly to my mystics. When you're dealing with mystics and
[14:19.700 --> 14:29.060]  you want to make sure it's end to end encrypted. Yeah. Well, we've gotten through two of the
[14:29.060 --> 14:32.740]  second round picks and now reluctantly we go to Andrew for his second pick.
[14:32.940 --> 14:35.960]  Oh, this is a good pick. I feel really strongly about this.
[14:36.220 --> 14:37.820]  You felt really strongly about the first one.
[14:37.880 --> 14:41.980]  Well, statistically, yes. But this is one from my heart that I feel this is
[14:41.980 --> 14:47.780]  one that I truly am as a person pulling for. And I do. I really think it's going to happen.
[14:47.780 --> 14:55.060]  My second prediction is that Nick does some form of very public and generous act of charity
[14:55.060 --> 14:59.160]  that touches all of us. That's my prediction. Part two.
[14:59.460 --> 15:03.800]  That's such a specific, weird pick. I think he has it in him this year.
[15:04.120 --> 15:09.360]  I really believe in him. I think getting a sense from Nick that he's a good guy. I
[15:09.360 --> 15:12.780]  think this will be the year that a big charitable act.
[15:13.500 --> 15:16.080]  You have just put a crushing weight upon me.
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.420]  This is how I'm feeling. I feel I just feel I can sense it in the air.
[15:20.900 --> 15:23.720]  How do I feel now? First time for everything.
[15:23.820 --> 15:28.500]  You know, I think I think you got it, man. I really think this is your year.
[15:28.820 --> 15:31.040]  Do you have any predictions about Andrew, Nick? You're up.
[15:31.380 --> 15:34.440]  Yeah, it is. It is Nick's turn. I also have some thoughts about some Andrew stuff,
[15:34.500 --> 15:38.640]  but I'll get to it later. I'm just I'm curious, but it's OK. All right. Hey, here we go, Nick.
[15:39.120 --> 15:43.220]  It's up to you. Your second pick in this. This could potentially apply to Andrew,
[15:43.220 --> 15:48.400]  but I will say that statistically it will happen to one of us this year.
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.720]  This year, one of us will have a root canal. Yeah, that was on my list, too.
[15:53.900 --> 15:56.160]  I was on my list. Oh, it's a good one.
[15:56.260 --> 15:57.460]  Yep. Root canal.
[15:58.120 --> 16:00.680]  Hopefully now it's Andrew. Why are you going to bring that shit?
[16:01.300 --> 16:07.600]  I'm sorry, Geoff. I'm sorry. It's not. Why do you have to point a fucking sniper rifle in my mouth,
[16:07.780 --> 16:12.620]  you motherfucker? You I hope that charity you perform this year's three root canal.
[16:12.620 --> 16:16.980]  So the rest of us will have to get them. Oh, I could ask my dad. He does root canals.
[16:17.220 --> 16:21.980]  He does. It's true. Yep. One of us will have a root canal.
[16:22.300 --> 16:26.640]  That was worse than a divorce one. Now I will say, no, it's not.
[16:26.640 --> 16:30.940]  That's crazy. It's not. It's less personal. I'm just going off data.
[16:31.240 --> 16:35.000]  Yeah, but I will. I won't be the divorce. I'll definitely be the root canal.
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.620]  Andrew's had a root canal. I haven't heard Gavin talk about his teeth. He probably hasn't looked
[16:39.620 --> 16:42.200]  at in ages. When was the last time you got your teeth looked at, Gavin?
[16:42.680 --> 16:46.380]  Yeah, six months ago. I'm going on the 10th of Feb, I think.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.900]  I mean, just just so we're all aware, it's I'm calling it right now.
[16:49.980 --> 16:52.960]  I might as well put it on the board. It will be me. I think it will be me.
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.020]  I'm not trying to will it in there. I'm just letting you know that I think it's going to be me.
[17:00.560 --> 17:03.820]  See, Geoff, I'm not directing it at you. What a crazy year for Eric.
[17:04.620 --> 17:09.160]  GTA six comes out, Robbie Williams dies, and he gets a root canal. Crazy.
[17:09.700 --> 17:14.420]  And what you're hoping for a divorce. But yeah, I'm not hoping for it. It's statistically
[17:14.420 --> 17:19.240]  probable. This are we Nostradamus draft here. What is your prediction?
[17:19.760 --> 17:23.700]  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a lot of shit on this board, a lot of dark sort of dread.
[17:24.140 --> 17:27.700]  So I'm going to take a page from Geoff Geoff's book and have a little ray of sunshine one.
[17:28.200 --> 17:31.180]  I think a new pasta shape will be invented.
[17:33.820 --> 17:34.600]  What do you think it will be?
[17:39.160 --> 17:43.420]  Anyone? I mean, I was going to say we were we were on the road to inventing the boot
[17:43.420 --> 17:47.940]  shaped pasta, remember? Oh, so you could fill it with pasta like like you're putting your
[17:47.940 --> 17:53.800]  feet in the boot. Has anyone made pasta countries like just the shape of the shapes of all the
[17:53.800 --> 18:00.620]  countries like, you know, a little spoonful of Russia, bit of France? I like that a little bit
[18:00.620 --> 18:07.340]  I think. I think the most recent pasta shape was this casket telly, I think, is what it was
[18:07.340 --> 18:11.800]  called. Interesting. When's that? I think that's a 20. I think it's a 2019 invention. Things
[18:11.800 --> 18:17.780]  like a pandemic invention. Yeah, we're definitely do. I think we're doing. Yeah. Yeah. But Gavin,
[18:18.160 --> 18:22.840]  a new pasta shape is your second round pick. What is your third round pick here? Oh,
[18:24.880 --> 18:30.600]  interesting. I'm going to go with professional athlete accidentally kills a crowd member.
[18:30.620 --> 18:36.680]  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Back to darkness. Yep. Could happen. Think it may be golf.
[18:37.140 --> 18:42.400]  Might be golf this time. You think golf does it? Golf? Yeah. Oh, they're right there, dude.
[18:42.760 --> 18:51.280]  All it takes is a hook. Yeah. I think it could be tennis. Tennis? Yeah. I think I think someone's
[18:51.280 --> 18:56.000]  going to get mad and they're going to hit a ball into the stands at someone. It's going to hit
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.740]  someone. They're going to be old. It's going to take them out. Hit them right in the throat.
[18:59.740 --> 19:04.080]  They can't breathe. They're frail. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Maybe in the throat or they fall to their
[19:04.080 --> 19:08.800]  death. Yeah. Has anyone ever been killed by a tennis ball? They're so soft. I mean, they're
[19:08.800 --> 19:13.120]  not soft, but compared to a cricket ball. Yeah, I mean, like it just it just feels like it's one
[19:13.120 --> 19:17.860]  of those sports where the spectators are close. The ball doesn't lose a ton of velocity. And I
[19:17.860 --> 19:22.640]  could see it hitting someone and becoming a big problem. I can. Yeah. I mean, happy Gilmore's
[19:22.640 --> 19:26.440]  dad died at a hockey game. Happy Gilmore 2 is coming up this year. I think it all
[19:26.440 --> 19:32.660]  could connect. Interesting. You have another death. Sports related incident. It's a good pick.
[19:32.940 --> 19:38.900]  It's a very good pick, Gavin. Thanks, Nick. What do you think in your third pick? Your third
[19:38.900 --> 19:46.960]  prediction? I think this is a little bit of sunshine on an otherwise rainy day. And especially
[19:46.960 --> 19:51.080]  for Geoff, because I think Geoff is going to be the only one of us to hit the average amount of hot
[19:51.080 --> 20:02.740]  dogs. Come on. Now, what is the average number? 170 or something. No, I think it was 70. Yeah,
[20:02.840 --> 20:10.800]  70. This is the, to me, the funniest pick of the whole thing. That's a very strong pick,
[20:10.920 --> 20:15.560]  dude. That's very good. That's very, very good. I think I've only had one hot dog in January,
[20:15.560 --> 20:20.480]  so I'm falling behind. Oh, man. I trust you. Now there's pressure on you. Yeah,
[20:20.480 --> 20:23.680]  no, you're right. I think it was a pretty safe bet. Now that's on the board, I have to do it.
[20:23.900 --> 20:30.040]  There you go. Yeah, I definitely think you can do it. I believe in you.
[20:30.660 --> 20:37.820]  Begrudgingly, we go back to Andrew with his third pick. The boldest pick I think anyone could make.
[20:38.140 --> 20:43.580]  Yeah, you already done, right? Yeah. Right. Yeah. Your first pick. Third pick. And it's third
[20:43.580 --> 20:49.260]  because it's, you know, so bold. I think Arizona iced tea will be raised above 99 cents this year.
[20:50.100 --> 20:55.040]  Oh, I think they finally have to go over. They can no longer hold the 99 cent price point. Their
[20:55.040 --> 21:00.600]  whole thing. That's their whole gimmick. I think it falls this year. How long has it been 99 cents
[21:00.600 --> 21:05.160]  their whole time? The entire time? I think they've existed. Oh, I'd assume that's their
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.660]  whole gimmick. Yeah. So I think Arizona iced tea over 99 cents. I think it finally happens.
[21:09.860 --> 21:13.580]  Now, this isn't part of the prediction, but just out of curiosity to you, what price do you arrive
[21:13.580 --> 21:23.160]  at? I'm going to say $1.15. $1.15. I'd say $1.29. $1.29. Yeah, I think that's, but then they say
[21:23.160 --> 21:30.980]  jumps 30 cents in like all the headlines. And that's, that's a lot. I think 15 is, you know,
[21:31.570 --> 21:37.320]  it's an easier pill to swallow. I will say, I thought what Andrew was doing here was giving
[21:37.320 --> 21:44.980]  predictions about all of us. No. And so don't, don't clutch your fucking pearls. I thought that
[21:44.980 --> 21:49.780]  you were doing predictions about all of us. So I was very curious to see who the final two were,
[21:49.800 --> 21:56.140]  because that would narrow down who the divorce was truly about. That's because it was going to be,
[21:56.520 --> 22:00.720]  I thought it was going to be like, it could be anyone. And then here's one about Nick. And then
[22:00.720 --> 22:05.140]  here's one about Geoff. And then here's one about Gavin. And it's like, boy, I wonder who the
[22:05.140 --> 22:11.120]  divorce could have been about. I've been clear this entire time. It is purely based on a 50
[22:11.120 --> 22:17.720]  percentile. That is statistics. I don't, it's a coin flip. I don't want any of this to happen.
[22:18.040 --> 22:23.540]  Don't agree with that. You do, but it's fine. But here's what Geoff predicts is going to happen in
[22:23.540 --> 22:28.280]  2025. I think this is one that everybody wants to happen. I bet it's not on anyone's radar.
[22:28.900 --> 22:34.320]  I haven't done any research into the matter other than I consulted a local forecaster and then
[22:34.320 --> 22:42.760]  also hired a soothsayer. We cross-referenced all and came up with the prediction that in 2025,
[22:43.020 --> 22:50.060]  a new dog breed is going to drop. A new dog? Yeah, we're going to get a new dog breed,
[22:50.280 --> 22:53.180]  a boutique dog breed. It's going to be some kind of doodle, maybe. Who knows?
[22:53.480 --> 23:00.220]  That is such a good prediction. And Geoff, can I say, can I piggyback off of this? Because
[23:00.220 --> 23:02.960]  it was going to be my fourth pick. I'm moving it up to my third now
[23:02.960 --> 23:15.280]  because I'm the last two in these. I have a dog speaks. Whoa! I think your new dog is going to
[23:15.280 --> 23:20.200]  say a single word. I don't think it's going to be a whole sentence. I think a dog is going to
[23:20.200 --> 23:26.660]  say like food. Like it's going to be, I think a dog will talk this year. I don't think a dog
[23:26.660 --> 23:32.720]  can make an F sound. I don't, but here's the thing. Geoff is predicting a new kind of dog.
[23:32.720 --> 23:37.620]  This is a dog that can say S. That is such a good point. Is there a list of current dog syllables
[23:37.620 --> 23:44.500]  or like dog mouth sounds that they can make? A list of dog syllables. Uh, let me see. How many
[23:44.500 --> 23:50.100]  syllables in dog? That's not what I'm looking for. What do you mean a dog can't make an F sound? It
[23:50.100 --> 23:58.060]  says woof. And think about it. That's so close to saying food. It's almost just backwards.
[23:58.620 --> 24:05.760]  Yeah. Yeah. When, when did the last dog drop by the way? Golden doodle maybe? When was the
[24:05.760 --> 24:11.260]  newest dog breed? You think this one's going to be a Corgi doodle or some shit? Yeah. Corgi doodle.
[24:11.640 --> 24:21.320]  A bison freeze doodle. The Danish Swedish. Whoa. Geoff. Okay. Yeah. The Danish Swedish farm dog
[24:21.320 --> 24:26.840]  was the newest dog breed recognized by the AKC, which is the American Kennel Club
[24:27.400 --> 24:36.180]  in January of 2025. I've already been proven correct. That's invalid then. A new dog has
[24:36.180 --> 24:41.820]  dropped. That you can't predict something that's already happened. I had no idea. I did no research.
[24:42.200 --> 24:46.160]  I don't think it's still full, but I think, you know what? We can invalidate that one that we saw
[24:46.160 --> 24:54.160]  of 11 months of new dog. Okay. Another new dog breed. Wow. Wow. Wow. Insane. That's crazy. This
[24:54.160 --> 25:00.020]  is so exciting. I didn't know dogs were still coming out. Oh, constantly. Dogs and apples,
[25:00.180 --> 25:04.940]  dude. Dogs and apples. You'd be surprised. They got, they're breeding dogs with apples. One of
[25:04.940 --> 25:09.180]  them is going to say the word food. Well, I think one dog will speak this year. It's going to be a
[25:09.180 --> 25:13.580]  thing in the news where it's like, this dog said a word and it will, it's called, it will speak.
[25:13.940 --> 25:20.740]  I think it's going to happen. It's called Dapple. It's this apple dog. Dapple. I'm going to stick
[25:20.740 --> 25:29.320]  with, for my final pick, this prediction for 2025. Um, I'm going to stay British. Uh, I'm,
[25:30.120 --> 25:35.200]  I think that this is a surefire one. I don't think it's, I don't think it's that outrageous.
[25:35.580 --> 25:39.140]  I think it's going to happen and it's going to be Oasis breaks up again.
[25:39.580 --> 25:42.460]  Oh, I was going to say Brexit too. Yeah, they are.
[25:46.080 --> 25:51.980]  I think Oasis will play some of their concerts and then refund a lot of people a lot of money.
[25:52.260 --> 25:55.640]  Oh, you don't even think they finished the tour? I don't think so. I think they're going to break
[25:55.640 --> 26:01.000]  up. I think it's going to be a very early, I don't think early, but I think it will be
[26:01.740 --> 26:05.980]  earlier than before they're done with everything. I think, I think Oasis is not making it to the
[26:05.980 --> 26:10.300]  end of that tour. I like that prediction a lot. I think that's a good one. Yeah. I feel pretty
[26:10.300 --> 26:13.180]  strongly about it. I have a lot of honorable mentions too, which we can go over here after
[26:13.180 --> 26:18.980]  we do our whole list, but A Dog Speaks and Oasis Breaks Up are my final two picks. And we go to
[26:18.980 --> 26:22.640]  Geoff, who predicted a new dog, which already occurred this year, but we are invalidating.
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.160]  Geoff, go ahead. I'm of two minds.
[26:28.220 --> 26:32.980]  I have a sports prediction I feel really good about, but I have an internal prediction as well.
[26:33.340 --> 26:38.820]  I just don't know which one. Ah, Andrew's first pick really makes me want to pick this one.
[26:39.330 --> 26:44.660]  You know what? Fuck it. I'm going to say in 2025, I predict. Andrew eats the pencil.
[26:50.220 --> 26:56.800]  Andrew 2025. Wow. Just trying to confirm that. Yeah, I think that's the first one that's autumn,
[26:56.840 --> 27:04.560]  like already not right. I think it might be the first definitely didn't happen one.
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.280]  What do you mean? What if you raised a hundred grand for Nick's charity to eat the pencil?
[27:11.700 --> 27:15.160]  I don't want to. That's Nick's thing. I don't want to get in the way of his thing.
[27:15.220 --> 27:17.660]  That's his big moment. What if one of us got divorced?
[27:20.640 --> 27:25.800]  What if you eating a pencil gave an MRI machine to a children's hospital?
[27:26.320 --> 27:33.960]  Wow. And Nick did it. And somehow Nick. Yeah. It's really nice that you eating that whole
[27:33.960 --> 27:41.380]  bag of wet bread is what led to that moment. It was a bed of wet bread, I think, wasn't it?
[27:42.540 --> 27:50.320]  Oh, man. The wet bed. Well, Andrew eats the pencil is Geoff's final prediction. Could happen. And
[27:50.320 --> 27:55.480]  then we have Andrew, who's going to give us his final evil prediction. My last prediction, not
[27:55.480 --> 28:00.980]  evil. I went statistically probable what I feel in my heart and then what I think will be the cold
[28:00.980 --> 28:09.340]  reality of the world. My last prediction is that an international incident will occur due to a
[28:10.020 --> 28:14.300]  weather balloon related problem involving Al Pacino.
[28:16.420 --> 28:22.260]  Okay. Al Pacino weather balloon incident. Thank you. So it just makes me really curious about
[28:22.260 --> 28:26.060]  your first pick where you said you really want to win. And then your last pick is weather balloon
[28:26.060 --> 28:31.840]  incident. This is the flex pick where when this happens, you guys will be like, holy fuck,
[28:32.100 --> 28:40.060]  he is Nostradamus. That is the point of this. How how does the Pacino factor? He's just there. He's
[28:40.060 --> 28:46.540]  part of it. What do you mean? You'll it'll it'll be it'll be made clear what happens. Yeah. You'll
[28:46.540 --> 28:52.040]  get more details at that time. He Al Pacino known to like to fly in weather balloons.
[28:52.820 --> 28:57.540]  Is there a fact about him? I don't know. I just made it up. Fly in a weather balloon.
[28:58.140 --> 29:01.620]  Well, what is the weather balloon? What's the big balloon that people ride in?
[29:01.800 --> 29:05.760]  Hot air balloon. Hot air balloon. Yeah. Hot air balloon. That's what I meant.
[29:07.460 --> 29:11.340]  So if the prediction's wrong, it's based on my not understanding of balloons.
[29:11.520 --> 29:14.420]  Is it hot air balloon or weather balloon? Let's go hot air balloon.
[29:14.860 --> 29:19.000]  A weather balloon is just they release it. It goes real high to take measurements of.
[29:19.300 --> 29:21.860]  Now it's going to be really fucking funny if there's a specific weather
[29:21.860 --> 29:26.340]  balloon. I swear to God, if Al Pacino gets in a weather balloon related incident, I fucking.
[29:27.580 --> 29:34.040]  I can be so mad. Hot air balloon Al Pacino incident. Do you remember the balloon boy
[29:34.040 --> 29:40.060]  hoax? Yes, of course. In 2009? But it's not going to be a hoax. It's going to be Al Pacino in a hot
[29:40.480 --> 29:45.000]  air balloon and he's going to get loose and something's going to happen and it's not going
[29:45.000 --> 29:51.720]  to be good for anybody. He survives the incident, doesn't die, but it causes a problem. He's lucky
[29:51.720 --> 29:57.260]  than Robbie Williams is what you're saying. Yes, this actually might be how Robbie Williams dies
[29:57.260 --> 30:02.680]  is via Al Pacino's hot air balloon. And then the dog sees it and he goes, oh my God.
[30:06.280 --> 30:09.420]  Nick, what is your final prediction for are we Nostradamus?
[30:09.860 --> 30:19.200]  I think in 2025 there will be a new world's hottest pepper. The last time we had one was 2023. It was
[30:19.200 --> 30:26.920]  Pepper X and it's 2.69 million Scoville. Fuck that. Are you going to try to eat it? If it's out,
[30:27.160 --> 30:33.900]  yes. Really? Yeah. No, for charity. Yeah. If people raise money for charity.
[30:36.160 --> 30:44.080]  Pepper X is disgusting looking. I don't... it looks... Pepper X looks sickly. Yeah. It's got
[30:45.340 --> 30:51.680]  gangles. It looks like a prolapsed asshole. It does. Like a boneless wing that has no meat on it.
[30:52.120 --> 30:57.280]  Yeah. I don't like this. This is the kind of thing that people have like a real weird, like,
[30:57.340 --> 31:00.960]  oh, I have like a phobia of stuff that looks like this. And you're like, I've never heard of that.
[31:01.040 --> 31:04.600]  Then you look at it and you go, oh, I get it. Yeah. We've evolved to look at that and go,
[31:05.200 --> 31:09.820]  yeah, absolutely. Yep. Maybe that's the new pasta shape.
[31:14.340 --> 31:19.760]  The whoops batch. Well, Nick predicting the new world's hottest pepper. Gavin,
[31:20.120 --> 31:22.860]  what is your final prediction? What are you saying is happening
[31:22.860 --> 31:26.520]  this year in the Are We Nostradamus predictions draft?
[31:29.060 --> 31:37.320]  Great. Dino.jif. What's a jif? No. Did I get like double donged? What's a...
[31:37.320 --> 31:41.160]  What is it? Dino.jif. What's a jif?
[31:42.520 --> 31:46.820]  JPEG file interchange format. Okay, let me... It didn't interchange.
[31:49.400 --> 31:53.060]  My prediction is Gavin's last pick is dog shit. Yeah.
[31:53.720 --> 32:05.560]  Save as. Okay. JPEG. Okay. Yeah. Save. Okay. Then. Okay. Yes. Got it.
[32:06.280 --> 32:12.680]  Oh. Oh. No. Sort by date. Keep all this in. You got it. It's all super usable stuff.
[32:13.360 --> 32:22.140]  Dinosaurs reboot. Oh. Oh. Did not see that coming. Nope. Okay. Do you think it picks up
[32:22.140 --> 32:26.900]  they left off at the ice age hitting or is it just a fresh reboot? Yeah, they all die at the end.
[32:30.280 --> 32:37.000]  Is the sitcom still a format? You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Tim Allen just got a new
[32:37.000 --> 32:43.020]  fucking sitcom. That's true. A month ago. Yeah. And Sean William Scott or whatever.
[32:43.420 --> 32:46.640]  He's in it or he also has a sitcom. No, he's in it. He's like the neighbor.
[32:46.640 --> 32:52.360]  Okay. Oh, good for him. Do you? So are you pulling for this, Gavin? Are you a big dinosaurs fan?
[32:52.840 --> 32:55.920]  No, I mean, I saw I saw it on TV before I went to school a few times.
[32:56.680 --> 33:01.160]  Not the mama. Yeah, I don't really have any any connection to it at all.
[33:01.860 --> 33:05.720]  And you just think dinosaurs are popular right now and they'll they'll bring it back and sort
[33:05.720 --> 33:10.920]  of this era of I think they'll reboot reboots. Honestly, it's not a bad prediction, not even
[33:10.920 --> 33:14.520]  because dinosaurs are popular, but it's one of those things where like a company doesn't want
[33:14.520 --> 33:20.320]  to lose an IP. So they like they just do it to do it. And you go, why the fuck are they doing that?
[33:20.360 --> 33:23.420]  And they're like, well, yeah, they just don't want to give up the dinosaurs IP.
[33:23.900 --> 33:27.180]  I bet it's more likely than one of us getting a divorce.
[33:27.860 --> 33:35.960]  I hope so. I don't know. Ridiculous. Still a ridiculous pick. But that is all of our
[33:35.960 --> 33:40.920]  our we Nostradamus predictions. Here is the board. And then we'll go to honorable mentions.
[33:40.920 --> 33:47.640]  Gavin has predicted Andrew breaks a chair. A new pasta shape. Pro athlete accidentally
[33:47.640 --> 33:53.980]  kills a crowd member and dinosaurs reboot. Nick has predicted in twenty twenty five
[33:53.980 --> 33:59.040]  the GTA six will be delayed to twenty twenty six. One of us will have a root canal.
[33:59.720 --> 34:07.040]  Geoff hits the average the hot dog average. Yeah. And then finally there is a new world's hottest
[34:07.040 --> 34:16.660]  pepper. Spicy. Andrew has predicted that in twenty twenty five, one of us will get a divorce
[34:16.660 --> 34:23.240]  and he hopes it happens to Nick performs a charity. Number three, Arizona Ice Team is above
[34:23.240 --> 34:31.560]  ninety nine cents. And for the hot air balloon Al Pacino incident, book it. OK, Geoff has predicted
[34:31.560 --> 34:38.500]  swing music is back. Dick Van Dyke will not die. A new dog breed. And Andrew eats the pencil.
[34:38.760 --> 34:45.840]  Gonna happen. And I have predicted that this year GTA six will release. Hell yeah. Robbie Williams
[34:45.840 --> 34:53.620]  will die. Oh no. A dog will speak. Hell yeah. An oasis will break up again. Those are our
[34:53.620 --> 34:59.280]  predictions. But what didn't make the cut, boys? What are your honorable mentions?
[34:59.280 --> 35:05.640]  I was going to put that a bat gets bird flu. And I thought that was probably bad news.
[35:07.220 --> 35:12.780]  I had the root canal. I also had the root canal. And then I have. Yeah, I got rid of
[35:12.780 --> 35:19.300]  a lot of my dark ones. I also had AI convinces human to kill itself. Oh yeah, that'll happen
[35:19.300 --> 35:24.160]  for sure. It's probably happening right now. Uh huh. But I did indeed at the end go with
[35:24.160 --> 35:29.820]  dinosaurs reboot. I had. I don't know why, but I've decided the Chicago Bears are going to make
[35:29.820 --> 35:36.460]  the playoffs. Oh, that's my sports one. I guess maybe because of Ben Johnson. And then I didn't
[35:36.460 --> 35:39.680]  end up using this one because I thought the dog was a little bit stronger. But I think in 2025,
[35:39.700 --> 35:44.480]  we bring an extinct animal back to life. Oh, that's interesting. I like that dinosaurs.
[35:44.480 --> 35:48.580]  Dinosaurs reboot. Alternate reboot.
[35:51.700 --> 36:02.300]  I had Warner Brothers get sold. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I also have a kiss reunites,
[36:02.460 --> 36:05.520]  but I didn't pick that because I don't think people know that they stopped.
[36:06.200 --> 36:14.440]  Yeah. So yeah, I was going to. That was exactly my thought. Yeah. So that's why I didn't pick it. I
[36:14.440 --> 36:23.980]  think they deunited. Yeah. Janko jeans are back, but I'm only medium on that one. I think that
[36:23.980 --> 36:27.680]  there'll be like a resurgent, but like only on TikTok, you'll like never see it in the wild.
[36:28.360 --> 36:34.680]  I also put Jake Paul retires from boxing, but that's part of a longer play that I think doesn't
[36:34.680 --> 36:39.920]  happen until 2027. So I don't think it happens this year. Do you think he retires from boxing
[36:39.920 --> 36:44.280]  and combat in general, or he moves into a different combat sport? Here's what I think
[36:44.280 --> 36:50.680]  Jake Paul does over the next three years. He will have one or two more fights. He will announce his
[36:50.680 --> 36:57.380]  retirement from boxing. He will go to rehab. He will become a weird Christian guy and talk about
[36:57.380 --> 37:02.760]  how much cocaine he was doing while he was boxing and doing all this stuff. And I can't suffer
[37:02.760 --> 37:08.800]  through the Jake Paul cocaine rehab press tour. I can't, I can't do it. I know it's coming,
[37:08.800 --> 37:12.040]  but I can't do it. Do you know what's worse than that? Do you know what's on the other end of that?
[37:12.360 --> 37:17.660]  What? He runs for some sort of public office. Oh, absolutely. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.
[37:17.740 --> 37:22.400]  A hundred percent. Um, and then I also wrote down, I don't really know what this one means,
[37:22.420 --> 37:26.340]  but it was one that I sort of like, what could it be? The moon comes to us.
[37:27.700 --> 37:32.300]  Yeah. Like, what could that be? Is sort of like, that's like the intrigue was more
[37:32.300 --> 37:37.460]  than like the actual prediction of like, what would the, what would that mean? The moon is
[37:37.460 --> 37:41.800]  closer now? I don't know. Maybe, but I think it could just mean that the next moon landing,
[37:41.920 --> 37:47.940]  they just bring a shitload of moon back. It could be. Start flogging moon. Yep. Could be.
[37:49.680 --> 37:52.900]  We got to do something with all this stuff. We're not doing anything with this moon.
[37:54.220 --> 37:58.940]  I think most of the moon is in, is in Houston right now. Is that right? And we only have like
[37:58.940 --> 38:02.700]  a little bit, right? It's not like we have like a lot of moon. Yeah. I think the most moon is
[38:02.700 --> 38:08.160]  in Houston. Yeah. We call it Moonstone, but it's okay. They should brag more about that.
[38:08.440 --> 38:14.180]  Anyone have any other honorable predictions? Honorable mentions here? I only had one other
[38:14.180 --> 38:18.320]  one and it was, uh, it was purely selfish and purely sports. And it was that the Spurs would
[38:18.320 --> 38:26.100]  make the Western conference finals. That is a way to curse yourself. Nick, I really love that
[38:26.100 --> 38:32.200]  you didn't even say win the championship. You went like, my bold prediction is they don't even
[38:32.200 --> 38:39.840]  win like the Western. They're sub 500. Let them have a win. My prediction is they make it to the
[38:39.840 --> 38:47.420]  third round of the playoffs. Good lord, dude. Oh man. They wildcard sneak their way in. Go Spurs
[38:47.420 --> 38:54.060]  go. Yeah. I was originally going to have mine start vague and just get more and more specific
[38:54.060 --> 38:58.940]  until something incredibly specific happens. So my last one was going to be a lunatic breaks
[38:58.940 --> 39:04.160]  into Big Ben and puts a watch strap on the back and sets the world record for the biggest watch
[39:04.160 --> 39:14.580]  worn. Oh, that's such a cool one. That's a really fun one. That person is Gavin. I cannot wait to
[39:14.580 --> 39:20.820]  revisit these in one year from now. I can wait to revisit some of them. Yeah. No, I can't wait to
[39:20.820 --> 39:26.960]  prove some of these wrong. I also can't wait to prove some of these wrong. Separated isn't
[39:26.960 --> 39:33.300]  divorced, Andrew. Separated isn't divorced. It doesn't count. Divorces take a long time, I think.
[39:33.400 --> 39:39.240]  Yeah. It's just couples count. I'm also going to argue that whatever Nick does is not for charity.
[39:39.760 --> 39:47.680]  What do you mean? I love people. I want to help people. Why are you laughing? What?
[39:49.660 --> 39:55.280]  Guys, those are our predictions. Comment with your predictions and find out if you
[39:55.280 --> 40:00.720]  are Nostradamus for the year 2025. We will revisit these in a year like a crime capsule,
[40:00.860 --> 40:05.420]  but for time. So I guess we call it a time capsule. We'll open it back up and see how we
[40:05.420 --> 40:11.360]  did in one year's time. Thank you for listening. Check out the Patreon. Check out the gameplay
[40:11.360 --> 40:15.520]  videos. Check out the podcast. Rate and review. Let a friend know that Rooster Teeth is gone.

[40:21.420 --> 40:25.660]  my prediction for 2025. Guys, thank you for listening so much, and we'll see you next time.
[40:25.820 --> 40:29.560]  Love you. Bye. I knew you were going to say that.
