[00:00.000 --> 00:03.520]  This is the, uh, dog run. Gavin vs. Nick.
[00:03.820 --> 00:05.180]  This is the first time we have not seen this.
[00:05.320 --> 00:06.260]  Yeah, he...
[00:06.260 --> 00:08.640]  What's up? Welcome to our unboxing of dog sport.
[00:09.380 --> 00:10.840]  Look at that Mario Pipe.
[00:11.220 --> 00:11.660]  Wow.
[00:12.520 --> 00:13.760]  We did choose green.
[00:14.140 --> 00:15.080]  Nick's stretching out.
[00:16.040 --> 00:18.780]  Gotta stretch a little. I don't want my hip to pop.
[00:18.880 --> 00:20.840]  It is Gavin!
[00:21.400 --> 00:21.840]  Shit!
[00:23.320 --> 00:26.880]  So, Geoff has the stopwatch. I have the camera.
[00:27.180 --> 00:27.440]  Uh-huh.
[00:27.480 --> 00:28.640]  He's gonna go...
[00:29.580 --> 00:30.700]  all the way down to the end,
[00:30.780 --> 00:32.000]  and then that's when the time will stop.
[00:32.240 --> 00:32.820]  Ready, Gavin?
[00:35.020 --> 00:35.360]  And...
[00:35.840 --> 00:36.180]  go!
