[00:00.000 --> 00:04.200]  Hello and welcome to Regulation Feud Best of Three Finale.
[00:05.600 --> 00:06.700]  How do we sync the video?
[00:08.840 --> 00:10.200]  We're good, keep going. We're good.
[00:10.280 --> 00:12.380]  Are you recording, Nick? Yeah, I got it.
[00:12.480 --> 00:14.700]  OK, this is all in. This is all great.
[00:15.080 --> 00:18.560]  This is the third match between the teams we have currently established.
[00:18.760 --> 00:23.240]  Not the finale of the show, just the finale of these current teams as they are.
[00:23.460 --> 00:26.460]  Yeah, me and Nick won the first two, so we're going to do a third one.
[00:26.780 --> 00:28.660]  No, match one went to Geoff and Gavin.
[00:28.660 --> 00:31.940]  Match two went to Nick and Eric.
[00:32.140 --> 00:34.900]  Match three, who can say?
[00:35.000 --> 00:37.420]  We're going to have to find out. The question mark.
[00:37.940 --> 00:39.860]  The champion. We don't know, Gavin.
[00:40.100 --> 00:42.700]  We don't know who's going to win match three.
[00:44.760 --> 00:47.580]  Competitors, are we ready to begin this match?
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.600]  Yeah, ready, ready, ready.
[00:50.780 --> 00:54.340]  We're ready. Let's let's scroll down to the decider question.
[00:54.660 --> 00:57.020]  Oh, wait, this is a blind side.
[00:57.020 --> 00:59.020]  This isn't regulation.
[00:59.420 --> 01:03.280]  How many blindsides do you get in a year?
[01:03.400 --> 01:06.400]  I get one podcast blindside.
[01:06.580 --> 01:09.120]  No, this is no. He's making a flex.
[01:09.380 --> 01:11.540]  He's making and I'm taking advantage.
[01:11.740 --> 01:13.980]  We're running out of time for the end of this year.
[01:14.520 --> 01:15.840]  I'm taking advantage of mine.
[01:15.980 --> 01:21.800]  We're going to watch. Listen, on the old podcast, we had HIV AIDS blindside.
[01:21.940 --> 01:24.320]  We haven't had one in this current era.
[01:24.840 --> 01:28.900]  So I want to want to take us in, educate the people on an important issue.
[01:29.060 --> 01:30.280]  Siding us with AIDS.
[01:30.520 --> 01:32.980]  No, it's listen, this is my first time doing it.
[01:33.240 --> 01:35.400]  It's a listen. It's a great PSA.
[01:35.700 --> 01:37.740]  We're we're going to watch this whole thing.
[01:37.940 --> 01:39.140]  Yep. We're watching it.
[01:41.100 --> 01:44.140]  So was feud a real thing at all?
[01:44.200 --> 01:46.460]  Yes. OK. Yeah. Was it a tie then?
[01:47.160 --> 01:47.860]  Yeah, I guess we tied.
[01:48.800 --> 01:50.480]  No, we know there'll be a part three.
[01:51.820 --> 01:54.100]  Oh, I I mean, I don't believe that,
[01:54.100 --> 01:58.700]  but OK, Andrew, you can give us a test on questions from this PSA
[01:58.700 --> 01:59.720]  and we'll see who does the best.
[02:02.100 --> 02:03.180]  Listen, this one, nothing.
[02:04.340 --> 02:06.840]  Much like it was going into game two of regulation, feud.
[02:10.450 --> 02:12.010]  I said it all was a funny dude.
[02:12.910 --> 02:14.370]  He is a 90s funny dude.
[02:14.670 --> 02:15.790]  Do you guys ever see White Nights?
[02:16.590 --> 02:19.730]  No, dude, he's fucking hilarious in White Nights.
[02:20.130 --> 02:20.550]  I don't know.
[02:20.670 --> 02:21.310]  Absolutely hilarious.
[02:21.610 --> 02:23.190]  Is it a sitcom? What is White Nights?
[02:23.310 --> 02:24.510]  No, it was Eddie Murphy.
[02:25.190 --> 02:27.810]  Uh, it was Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall movie.
[02:28.190 --> 02:30.210]  Oh, did they dress up as a bunch of characters?
[02:30.370 --> 02:31.990]  I had also had Richard Pryor in it.
[02:32.130 --> 02:34.650]  No, they played like they played like a
[02:35.370 --> 02:37.150]  like low, like a Harlem mafia.
[02:37.470 --> 02:40.410]  And then they were getting pushed on by a bunch of white dudes and cops.
[02:40.430 --> 02:42.710]  And then they had to like it was kind of like the sting in Harlem.
[02:43.350 --> 02:44.610]  Oh, time out.
[02:45.290 --> 02:48.450]  I don't know if y'all notice this, but all of Arsenio Hall's clothes
[02:48.450 --> 02:49.470]  have tags on them.
[02:49.530 --> 02:50.730]  Yeah, I think they're returning them after this.
[02:52.710 --> 02:53.430]  That's awesome.
[02:56.800 --> 02:58.260]  Cool of Arsenio Hall.
[03:00.740 --> 03:02.400]  Oh, this is celebrity filled.
[03:04.160 --> 03:05.900]  Really? Oh, yeah.
[03:07.140 --> 03:09.080]  He almost got misconceptions out perfectly.
[03:10.500 --> 03:12.580]  Yeah. See? Oh, my God.
[03:12.920 --> 03:18.260]  As you would see through Magic Johnson's career as a broadcaster, et cetera.
[03:18.520 --> 03:19.740]  It's not his strong suit.
[03:19.820 --> 03:21.880]  His strong suit was playing the game of basketball.
[03:23.720 --> 03:25.600]  You didn't like him in the front office for the Lakers?
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.900]  I didn't like him in anything except playing the game of basketball.
[03:30.900 --> 03:34.160]  You think Mr. Belvedere explained AIDS to Pauly Shore as well?
[03:34.880 --> 03:39.100]  Dude, Pauly Shore is one of those people that's never going to die.
[03:39.660 --> 03:44.400]  He's going to be like 104 and we'll still be hearing about his every year on his birthday.
[03:48.550 --> 03:49.910]  Is Mitzi still around?
[03:50.870 --> 03:52.590]  No, she died. She died.
[03:57.070 --> 04:00.930]  I'm sorry, are they just putting microphones in people's faces at the mall
[04:00.930 --> 04:03.570]  and going, do you know what AIDS is? Yes, yes, they are.
[04:03.890 --> 04:05.290]  This is before the mall left.
[04:06.650 --> 04:08.750]  This is the height of the mall, dude.
[04:08.890 --> 04:10.070]  Yeah, man. This is peak mall.
[04:10.210 --> 04:11.990]  This is where you go when you want to talk to people.
[04:12.090 --> 04:16.510]  Dude, hey, hey, if I was at the mall and Pauly Shore walked up to me
[04:16.510 --> 04:19.670]  with a microphone, he just went, hey, you know what AIDS is, buddy?
[04:20.470 --> 04:21.330]  I'd hightail it.
[04:21.790 --> 04:23.930]  This is where the idea for Impractical Jokers came from.
[04:24.570 --> 04:26.290]  I love that you chased them into the store.
[04:26.390 --> 04:27.710]  He's in the back rooms of the mall.
[04:30.370 --> 04:33.870]  Also, just the idea that you would think that Pauly Shore was doing this in earnest.
[04:34.190 --> 04:36.050]  This is an educational thing.
[04:38.870 --> 04:42.010]  You never assume Pauly Shore was doing this, not as a bit.
[04:43.350 --> 04:44.830]  So people know, I can't hear what anyone's saying.
[04:44.910 --> 04:46.170]  Are they saying they don't know what it is?
[04:46.550 --> 04:48.730]  No, they all seem pretty well informed. Oh.
[04:51.210 --> 04:52.410]  Turn up your stream volume.
[04:53.710 --> 04:54.710]  Oh, that's a good point.
[04:59.140 --> 05:01.560]  I have mine lower because I don't want to fucking hear it.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.120]  Eric's anti-AIDS.
[05:05.580 --> 05:07.760]  Yeah, yeah, and Geoff is pro-AIDS.
[05:09.100 --> 05:10.720]  I'm pro talking about it.
[05:11.680 --> 05:13.540]  Who refuses to wear the ribbon, Geoff?
[05:14.440 --> 05:16.880]  What? It's a Seinfeld reference.
[05:17.200 --> 05:25.090]  I really got you.
[05:25.950 --> 05:27.650]  It's just quite explicit.
[05:28.170 --> 05:29.430]  Yeah. Did you know I'm looking it up?
[05:29.510 --> 05:31.770]  There are now seven patients who've been cured of it.
[05:32.370 --> 05:33.790]  Is that right? Yeah.
[05:34.030 --> 05:35.670]  Wow. Really? Wow.
[05:36.710 --> 05:38.570]  This is so nice.
[05:38.710 --> 05:43.250]  The backdrop, the like the font, like everything.
[05:44.170 --> 05:46.690]  Oh, no. Oh, no.
[05:47.110 --> 05:49.950]  This is the most scatterbrained piece of content.
[05:50.550 --> 05:54.470]  It this it feels like it's made.
[05:55.530 --> 05:59.930]  By people who go, well, we have to keep it like moving,
[05:59.930 --> 06:01.990]  otherwise the kids won't pay attention to it.
[06:02.070 --> 06:05.830]  And you end up with like insane media.
[06:06.190 --> 06:08.350]  It will not slow down. It will not stop.
[06:08.810 --> 06:11.170]  This is how you had to talk to us back then.
[06:11.230 --> 06:13.510]  This is the only way we could receive information.
[06:20.440 --> 06:22.200]  Oh, I don't know who wrote this.
[06:23.380 --> 06:24.300]  It's a great question.
[06:24.460 --> 06:26.140]  This is a Jaleel White original right here.
[06:26.960 --> 06:28.860]  Like this had to be this was directed and produced.
[06:31.260 --> 06:32.320]  What is this called, Andrew?
[06:32.320 --> 06:33.900]  A timeout.
[06:44.990 --> 06:46.270]  Oh, oh.
[06:47.650 --> 06:50.830]  You guys will never you guys will never guess who directed it.
[06:51.490 --> 06:53.450]  Wilford Brimley. Christopher Nolan.
[06:54.090 --> 06:55.150]  I was about to say Nolan.
[06:55.370 --> 06:57.750]  I bet it's Rob Reiner.
[06:58.730 --> 06:59.990]  Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[07:01.590 --> 07:03.290]  I don't know who that is. Who's that?
[07:03.850 --> 07:04.810]  Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[07:04.810 --> 07:07.510]  He was the older brother on Cosby Show.
[07:08.430 --> 07:09.610]  Oh, no way.
[07:10.450 --> 07:11.890]  He also did Friday Night Videos.
[07:12.070 --> 07:14.310]  Oh, that was him. He was just there.
[07:14.970 --> 07:16.790]  Theo Huxtable? Yeah, Theo Huxtable.
[07:17.050 --> 07:17.790]  That's Malcolm Jamal Warner.
[07:19.690 --> 07:23.350]  Oh, it's the woman that was arguing with dad on our show.
[07:26.650 --> 07:27.450]  Wait, what?
[07:31.370 --> 07:33.650]  The writer was a guy named Thad Mumford,
[07:33.650 --> 07:40.050]  who died in 2018, and he wrote for M.A.S.H.
[07:41.730 --> 07:44.590]  and The Electric Company and A Different World.
[07:48.130 --> 07:51.410]  Sesame Street, definitely encouraged Arsenio.
[07:51.690 --> 07:54.510]  We got Urkel rapping about his dick exploding.
[07:54.610 --> 07:56.750]  I think we're going to we're going to get it.
[07:56.910 --> 07:57.750]  People are going to get this.
[07:58.230 --> 07:59.450]  Keep going. Never stop moving.
[07:59.590 --> 08:01.930]  Centerville, Ohio. This I love this fall.
[08:01.930 --> 08:05.370]  I want this to be how Regulation Podcast looks like.
[08:05.390 --> 08:07.190]  I want the font flying everywhere.
[08:07.550 --> 08:10.270]  I want some of it to be in capital letters
[08:10.270 --> 08:13.150]  and some of it to be in big fat fucking lowercase letters.
[08:13.570 --> 08:16.030]  It is kind of how it looks in my brain when we're doing it.
[08:18.790 --> 08:21.110]  Didn't did Magic Johnson have a talk show?
[08:21.590 --> 08:22.990]  Yeah, not very long, but he did.
[08:23.170 --> 08:24.710]  Nope. It was a late night show, wasn't it?
[08:24.910 --> 08:25.950]  Yeah. Yeah.
[08:26.690 --> 08:28.030]  I think he lasted one season.
[08:28.190 --> 08:30.810]  Again, he's good at playing basketball.
[08:30.810 --> 08:34.310]  Magic Johnson was from an era of he was really from,
[08:34.450 --> 08:38.670]  I would say, the last era of athletes who weren't media trained
[08:38.670 --> 08:43.490]  and weren't like also necessarily personalities like Michael Jordan.
[08:43.590 --> 08:47.570]  Same way. Most amazing basketball player of all time, but kind of wouldn't
[08:47.570 --> 08:49.150]  in front of the camera, you know?
[08:49.690 --> 08:53.350]  And we're spoiled by the Chris Pauls and the Blake Griffins
[08:53.350 --> 08:56.990]  and the LeBron Jameses and the Patrick Mahomes of the world now.
[08:57.130 --> 08:58.870]  It wasn't like that back in the day.
[08:59.550 --> 09:01.850]  We had Charles Barkley and Shaq, you know?
[09:02.030 --> 09:05.270]  That's why Magic Johnson was such a like, wow.
[09:05.650 --> 09:10.830]  Like this guy can dribble a basketball and he's smiling in a sort of affable.
[09:11.030 --> 09:15.890]  That went such a long way in the 1980s when no one else was doing it.
[09:16.030 --> 09:19.190]  He's easily one of the most likable players from that era.
[09:19.310 --> 09:22.550]  And compare him to like, you know, one of my favorite players, Larry Bird.
[09:22.890 --> 09:25.890]  There's a reason you don't see Larry Bird in anything ever.
[09:26.310 --> 09:27.730]  Yeah. He was kind of a dick.
[09:27.730 --> 09:30.890]  Kind of a dick and not not super likable or personable
[09:30.890 --> 09:33.050]  in front of a camera, you know?
[09:33.190 --> 09:36.290]  No. Now everyone's media trained. It's different.
[09:38.750 --> 09:41.570]  But just live in a world where you're, you know,
[09:42.250 --> 09:44.990]  on camera 24 hours a day, no matter where you are. Yeah.
[09:47.370 --> 09:50.330]  That guy is not having a great time at the table.
[09:50.730 --> 09:52.770]  He regrets signing up for this.
[09:52.890 --> 09:54.410]  100 percent. That guy's me right now, dude.
[09:54.470 --> 09:56.070]  He can't get out easily. Yep.
[09:58.050 --> 10:00.250]  I'm I'm seeing myself in meetings.
[10:03.230 --> 10:07.110]  It's kind of interesting, though, because we saw like how they introduced
[10:07.630 --> 10:10.870]  AIDS to kids in the 80s through Mr. Belvedere.
[10:11.090 --> 10:14.090]  And now you're seeing like the next generation, how they tackle it.
[10:14.410 --> 10:17.550]  Yeah. This is how I remember. Way more informative, by the way.
[10:17.830 --> 10:22.890]  Not not necessarily this video, but I remember learning about it.
[10:22.950 --> 10:26.730]  And it was very much in this tone of like, we're pretty street,
[10:26.730 --> 10:28.630]  but also vaginal fluids.
[10:30.150 --> 10:34.090]  This came out when I was in 11th grade, so I probably didn't have to watch it
[10:34.090 --> 10:37.950]  in class, but I bet if I was like in ninth grade, I would have had to that year.
[10:38.690 --> 10:41.310]  I mean, if they tried to play in class, you would protest it
[10:41.310 --> 10:42.070]  because of Magic Johnson.
[10:42.210 --> 10:44.250]  I assume as a Celtics fan, you would not allow this.
[10:45.570 --> 10:48.050]  What's the difference between blood and blood products? Dad.
[10:50.650 --> 10:53.210]  He is, but his son is a professional wrestler.
[10:53.930 --> 10:58.510]  Really? Yeah, he's a Jack Perry in AEW.
[10:58.990 --> 11:00.490]  He's the current TNT champion.
[11:00.630 --> 11:02.590]  That was a sad one. I liked him, Luke Perry.
[11:02.950 --> 11:05.450]  Yeah. It was in the fifth element.
[11:06.610 --> 11:08.670]  Was he? It was. Yeah.
[11:09.390 --> 11:11.150]  Where was he in the fifth element? I don't remember that.
[11:12.090 --> 11:12.530]  Right at the beginning.
[11:16.400 --> 11:19.420]  Just a if he's a he wouldn't be saying it if it wasn't true.
[11:20.080 --> 11:21.260]  He always gets you with this bullshit.
[11:22.380 --> 11:24.360]  Bullshit. It's just the start of the movie.
[11:24.360 --> 11:28.700]  Say yes. Was he like the priest assistant dude?
[11:29.120 --> 11:31.420]  What the? He was the Aziz Lai assistant.
[11:35.140 --> 11:38.140]  OK. OK.
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.420]  Is this a Cosby show stuff or something?
[11:44.740 --> 11:47.860]  I could be 92, probably a different world, maybe.
[11:49.420 --> 11:50.780]  Oh, is Dwayne Wade in this?
[11:52.060 --> 11:53.220]  I want to see him slip up his sunglasses.
[11:57.620 --> 11:59.520]  Oh, shit. Oh, it's this guy.
[12:04.200 --> 12:05.320]  He's on SNL, right?
[12:06.040 --> 12:07.640]  I don't think so. I don't think he's on SNL.
[12:07.700 --> 12:09.000]  Is that Paul Rodriguez? Is that his name?
[12:09.300 --> 12:15.040]  I think so. He was very, very much like an 80s, 90s comedian.
[12:15.260 --> 12:15.800]  Paul Rodriguez.
[12:18.500 --> 12:21.260]  The thing they're watching is in black and white, is it? OK, it is.
[12:25.310 --> 12:26.250]  Oh, that's what's her face?
[12:27.850 --> 12:28.730]  Is she from a different world?
[12:29.090 --> 12:29.830]  Yeah, she's from a different world.
[12:29.830 --> 12:30.950]  And that's Dwayne Wade.
[12:32.170 --> 12:34.570]  He's got his... he doesn't have his sunglasses on.
[12:34.890 --> 12:35.890]  Yeah, he's got his cool guy.
[12:36.430 --> 12:38.950]  Boo! Put on your sunglasses! Boo!
[12:40.110 --> 12:41.590]  Do you think we can make regulation?
[12:41.790 --> 12:43.170]  Oh, we should make those sunglasses.
[12:43.770 --> 12:45.630]  And then they would have the logo on them.
[12:46.350 --> 12:47.770]  Oh, this is such a good idea.
[12:48.690 --> 12:52.630]  You know, I think she was also in White Nights, if I remember correctly.
[12:53.790 --> 12:55.270]  It's a lot of White Nights connections.
[12:55.370 --> 12:56.490]  Dude, we got to watch that movie.
[12:56.570 --> 12:57.390]  That should be a watch along.
[12:57.390 --> 12:58.690]  Is that going to be your blindside?
[12:59.150 --> 13:00.170]  Funny, dirty movie.
[13:02.980 --> 13:05.440]  What do you think the first thing was that didn't hold up?
[13:07.960 --> 13:08.840]  Oh, man.
[13:09.300 --> 13:10.400]  Oh, boy. That's a sex joke?
[13:11.800 --> 13:12.100]  No.
[13:18.610 --> 13:21.110]  Like, do you think someone in the 60s was watching Gone with the Wind
[13:21.110 --> 13:22.950]  and it's like, this didn't hold up?
[13:23.410 --> 13:24.530]  Yeah, I'm trying to...
[13:24.530 --> 13:29.010]  Think about these sunglasses, right, that I'm dropping in the chat.
[13:29.550 --> 13:30.530]  Look at those sunglasses.
[13:30.530 --> 13:35.470]  Imagine if we had those, but we had the show logo, the asterisk over the eyes.
[13:35.550 --> 13:36.910]  So you pulled them down and then you couldn't see?
[13:37.190 --> 13:39.010]  Well, no, you could see. You could just see right through them.
[13:39.330 --> 13:42.610]  But, yeah, damn.
[13:42.790 --> 13:43.730]  I think it's such a good idea.
[13:44.290 --> 13:46.190]  Those are pretty cool sunglasses, right?
[13:55.890 --> 13:56.950]  You tell him, Paul Rodriguez.
[13:58.110 --> 14:00.930]  Thrifty has a sale on condoms?
[14:01.150 --> 14:02.850]  Don't buy for sale condoms.
[14:03.130 --> 14:05.830]  What is the most famous movie was?
[14:05.830 --> 14:09.710]  Oh, Born in East LA. Born in East LA, it's got to be.
[14:11.110 --> 14:11.830]  That's right.
[14:12.150 --> 14:14.030]  I'm using Quicksilver, Made in America.
[14:15.210 --> 14:16.770]  DC Cab, Jesus Christ.
[14:17.310 --> 14:22.390]  Do you think a lot of Gen Z or the new one knows what that white noise is?
[14:23.210 --> 14:25.290]  The new one. The new one. Alpha.
[14:25.490 --> 14:26.910]  Alpha. Yeah. Yeah, they're alpha.
[14:27.690 --> 14:28.830]  Is that what your kid is?
[14:29.490 --> 14:30.230]  Yeah, he's alpha.
[14:30.630 --> 14:32.490]  Go ask him if he knows what static is.
[14:32.750 --> 14:33.850]  Your kid is red versus blue?
[14:34.550 --> 14:40.310]  Oh, man.
[14:40.490 --> 14:43.530]  Oh, yeah.
[14:43.810 --> 14:45.930]  Oh, yeah.
[14:46.250 --> 14:47.550]  Fucking Sinbad.
[14:47.610 --> 14:50.050]  A little Sinbad. Johnny headed Sinbad.
[14:50.910 --> 14:51.550]  Damn.
[14:54.280 --> 14:56.200]  There's a hole in that condom.
[14:57.340 --> 14:58.380]  Oh, no!
[15:00.820 --> 15:03.100]  It would be a lot better if it was just like...
[15:06.740 --> 15:08.920]  It just says Sinbad across it.
[15:10.880 --> 15:12.320]  Trust me, it's Sinbad.
[15:14.500 --> 15:17.760]  I don't know where he is in America right now or in the world
[15:17.760 --> 15:21.140]  and what he's doing, but I guarantee you somebody's laughing right now.
[15:22.040 --> 15:22.920]  He's a funny dude. He's great.
[15:23.480 --> 15:24.800]  He's very funny. Yeah.
[15:29.160 --> 15:32.000]  Spermicidally lubricated sounds like one of Gavin's worm schemes.
[15:34.400 --> 15:36.380]  Do you think they'd censor it or no?
[15:37.000 --> 15:37.600]  Oh, yeah.
[15:51.230 --> 15:52.110]  Covid condom.
[15:54.230 --> 15:55.710]  Go get the goat skin, get the latex.
[15:55.930 --> 15:57.090]  Is he in a straitjacket?
[16:01.710 --> 16:03.550]  Ain't gonna happen. Yeah, that is a great one.
[16:06.250 --> 16:08.910]  He's definitely in like some...
[16:08.910 --> 16:13.310]  I think he's in a sheet that's probably wrapped around the back and tied.
[16:13.970 --> 16:14.810]  That makes sense.
[16:20.910 --> 16:23.810]  Is this the only collaboration between Tom Cruise and Sinbad?
[16:24.530 --> 16:26.010]  Is Tom Cruise in this? Wow.
[16:26.370 --> 16:28.030]  We already saw him. We went past him.
[16:28.230 --> 16:29.110]  Yeah, we already saw him. Oh, did we?
[16:29.330 --> 16:30.250]  Where did we see Tom Cruise?
[16:30.730 --> 16:31.430]  Just for a minute.
[16:31.730 --> 16:33.090]  He was just talking to the camera.
[16:33.110 --> 16:35.250]  He was very intensely talking about having sex.
[16:35.730 --> 16:36.670]  Oh, I might have Googled.
[16:36.710 --> 16:37.770]  I might have been Googling something else.
[16:40.510 --> 16:41.690]  Probably looking at Paul Rodriguez.
[16:49.890 --> 16:51.790]  Why is it long?
[16:52.630 --> 16:54.830]  Why is it like that? What the fuck?
[16:55.170 --> 16:56.350]  Did they used to be shaped long?
[16:57.210 --> 16:58.930]  They used to have condoms like that.
[16:59.030 --> 17:00.310]  Really? They probably still do.
[17:01.150 --> 17:02.890]  A needle condom? What is that?
[17:03.010 --> 17:04.730]  How do you... is it for like oval dicks?
[17:05.390 --> 17:07.590]  No, they're just like, it's just like smushed.
[17:07.730 --> 17:09.350]  You pop it out, it'll just go to the normal size.
[17:09.790 --> 17:11.690]  Oh. Oh.
[17:12.950 --> 17:14.530]  All right. There's a penis right there.
[17:17.150 --> 17:19.910]  The idea that that that lady is like,
[17:20.090 --> 17:22.150]  yeah, I was in a movie once with Tom Cruise.
[17:22.370 --> 17:23.810]  I was in the Hall of Magic Johnson.
[17:24.690 --> 17:25.910]  What was your role?
[17:26.510 --> 17:29.050]  I held up a fake dick with my fingers.
[17:29.410 --> 17:31.050]  I don't want to talk about it.
[17:33.150 --> 17:35.910]  If this condom pops out and becomes normal shaped,
[17:36.050 --> 17:36.950]  and it's going to blow my mind.
[17:43.120 --> 17:44.340]  Just like that, it's normal.
[17:44.460 --> 17:46.180]  Just like that. Whoa. Wow.
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.660]  Yeah, they're pretty bendable.
[17:48.860 --> 17:50.200]  Maybe it causes a weakness.
[17:53.060 --> 17:53.500]  Uh.
[17:56.420 --> 17:57.360]  Be a better penis.
[17:57.560 --> 17:59.620]  I move. As you do.
[18:00.300 --> 18:02.260]  Oh, that's lopsided. Oh, man.
[18:03.460 --> 18:07.520]  And then pull it up a little bit, tie it in a knot at the end and
[18:08.540 --> 18:10.620]  and then pull it over. Tie it off again.
[18:10.820 --> 18:14.200]  Pull. OK, so then pull the bottom part down far, stuff the balls in
[18:14.200 --> 18:15.660]  and then get to business.
[18:17.220 --> 18:19.580]  Do you think Arsenio Hall's condoms have tags on them?
[18:21.300 --> 18:22.140]  Yeah, he's going to return them.
[18:22.140 --> 18:23.500]  Ha ha ha.
[18:27.360 --> 18:30.680]  Has someone ever got pregnant from condom spillage?
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.400]  Oh, I don't doubt it. Yeah, I don't doubt that.
[18:34.560 --> 18:36.120]  Like a bunch of NBA players, right?
[18:36.620 --> 18:38.680]  Yep. Paula.
[18:44.390 --> 18:46.070]  Well, check this out.
[18:46.550 --> 18:49.470]  It's so, so good for her to have a career built on.
[18:50.590 --> 18:51.890]  Whatever it is she did.
[18:52.690 --> 18:54.310]  She said, come on, dude.
[18:54.370 --> 18:55.990]  She sang with the MC Scat Cat.
[18:56.310 --> 18:58.130]  She did. She was a Laker girl.
[18:58.290 --> 19:00.070]  She sang with the Cat.
[19:00.310 --> 19:01.730]  She had Keanu Reeves in her music video.
[19:01.910 --> 19:03.570]  She was huge. Yeah. American Idol.
[19:03.990 --> 19:05.530]  She was for a minute and then American Idol.
[19:05.750 --> 19:06.850]  And that was like the resurgence.
[19:07.150 --> 19:08.570]  Friends with Simon Cowell.
[19:08.730 --> 19:10.070]  Friends with Simon Cowell.
[19:10.230 --> 19:12.330]  With her being a Laker girl and this being a Magic Johnson thing,
[19:12.370 --> 19:15.470]  I feel like you can probably tie Magic Johnson to all these people in some way.
[19:15.510 --> 19:18.990]  I think when you said this seems like a thing that people needed to, like,
[19:19.070 --> 19:21.230]  call in favors for, it was Magic Johnson going,
[19:21.230 --> 19:22.850]  I'm doing this, you're doing this.
[19:23.790 --> 19:25.170]  Hey, that guy's Glenn.
[19:26.210 --> 19:27.190]  Glenn is one.
[19:28.490 --> 19:29.350]  Friends with Magic Johnson.
[19:36.440 --> 19:37.420]  What? Jesus.
[19:44.240 --> 19:44.760]  What?
[19:46.300 --> 19:47.980]  We're talking about cats.
[19:49.240 --> 19:51.620]  So are the cats OK or where did the cats go?
[19:51.620 --> 19:52.700]  What did the cats have to do with the dogs?
[19:53.900 --> 19:56.020]  Did you guys grow up scared of AIDS?
[19:56.820 --> 19:58.500]  No. No. Yes.
[19:59.120 --> 20:00.300]  A little, yeah.
[20:00.720 --> 20:01.980]  I think it must be my generation.
[20:01.980 --> 20:03.280]  I was fucking terrified.
[20:03.440 --> 20:05.980]  I was like 18 when kids came out and that was it.
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.060]  It was over. I never wanted to have sex again after that.
[20:09.020 --> 20:10.260]  Again, big quotes.
[20:10.740 --> 20:14.120]  It was just among the sexually transmitted stuff to be scared of.
[20:14.400 --> 20:14.920]  Yes, exactly.
[20:15.120 --> 20:16.820]  It was never specifically AIDS for me.
[20:17.100 --> 20:17.560]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[20:17.560 --> 20:19.060]  That's a great way to put it. Yes.
[20:19.560 --> 20:24.280]  For me, it was every other STI can fuck your month up.
[20:24.560 --> 20:25.220]  AIDS will kill you.
[20:26.880 --> 20:30.520]  Yeah, it was bigger in the 90s when I was younger.
[20:30.520 --> 20:33.680]  And then, like, as I got older, it seemed to kind of fade to the...
[20:33.680 --> 20:35.440]  Were you still learning about this stuff when you were older?
[20:37.100 --> 20:41.020]  Yeah, Nick only just learned about this stuff like a week or two ago, I think.
[20:41.120 --> 20:42.780]  Why do you think I set this up, Gavin?
[20:43.320 --> 20:44.240]  What is this, October?
[20:44.400 --> 20:46.120]  You still need to know about this in like July.
[20:46.620 --> 20:47.920]  This is Nick's intervention.
[20:48.580 --> 20:49.120]  Oh, no.
[20:49.680 --> 20:52.080]  Oh, it's a blindside.
[20:52.240 --> 20:52.920]  Isn't this crazy?
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.100]  So we're going to sit down and learn.
[20:56.080 --> 20:57.820]  It's a birds and the bees blindside.
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.300]  Oh, no. Archie, where'd you come from?
[21:03.520 --> 21:04.900]  I think I have to have a chat.
[21:05.120 --> 21:07.100]  I went to high school with a girl who didn't know how she got pregnant.
[21:08.220 --> 21:08.860]  That's crazy.
[21:09.480 --> 21:10.880]  She said on a toilet seat, funny.
[21:11.880 --> 21:13.480]  Somebody explained it to her eventually, I think.
[21:13.560 --> 21:15.620]  But yeah, it's just one of those things where it's like,
[21:15.680 --> 21:17.200]  we can't get pregnant the first time you have sex.
[21:17.500 --> 21:18.740]  Yeah, I think so. Is that right?
[21:18.840 --> 21:19.860]  OK. Yeah, I think so.
[21:20.200 --> 21:22.640]  Right. Some people give birth without realizing they're pregnant.
[21:23.880 --> 21:25.380]  Oh, that. Yeah. Yeah.
[21:26.200 --> 21:29.180]  Hey, Gavin, do you think Deckard was a replicant?
[21:32.800 --> 21:34.980]  Uh, don't they just straight up tell you in the second one?
[21:36.160 --> 21:38.820]  I don't want to. I don't want to bring in, you know,
[21:38.920 --> 21:40.760]  canon that's past the original movie.
[21:40.820 --> 21:42.660]  I just I mean, it's it's canon, though.
[21:43.660 --> 21:45.860]  Right. Let's say the second movie didn't happen. What do you think?
[21:45.900 --> 21:47.400]  Yeah, that that's what I'm talking about.
[21:49.260 --> 21:50.300]  Yeah, of course.
[21:52.220 --> 21:54.560]  I'm just asking, guys, you don't have to be mad at me about it.
[21:56.380 --> 21:58.180]  Oh, my God. Well, oh, wow.
[21:58.180 --> 22:00.660]  Yeah. Pre-Starship Troopers.
[22:00.980 --> 22:03.420]  Yeah, this is this is a dookie right here.
[22:05.580 --> 22:06.440]  Oh, they got a doctor.
[22:07.140 --> 22:10.900]  That dude was that dude was so cool when I was growing up.
[22:11.500 --> 22:14.700]  He and then when I was growing up, he wasn't.
[22:14.860 --> 22:15.880]  Yeah. Right. It flipped.
[22:15.940 --> 22:19.760]  But he made every kid my age feel like they could be smart and a grown up.
[22:20.480 --> 22:24.900]  And then like no career in the 90s, except he did Starship Troopers.
[22:24.900 --> 22:27.500]  And then all of a sudden, gigantic resurgence.
[22:27.500 --> 22:30.180]  Dr. Horrible, I think, is what's crazy.
[22:30.480 --> 22:32.640]  So that's how I'm how I met your mother.
[22:32.760 --> 22:34.300]  That or how I met your mom. Yeah. Gigantic.
[22:34.580 --> 22:35.260]  Dude, I'm Kumar.
[22:36.060 --> 22:38.420]  I oh, yeah, that was like the really big thing, huh?
[22:38.560 --> 22:39.720]  Timmy and Harold Kumar.
[22:40.840 --> 22:42.320]  Wasn't he a dick in that or something?
[22:42.500 --> 22:45.840]  It was like him playing like against type and people are like, this is so funny.
[22:48.180 --> 22:51.640]  If you ever hadn't seen Don't Trust the B in apartment 23.
[22:53.300 --> 22:56.660]  What's his name from Dawson's Creek plays that version of James Van Der Beek.
[22:56.660 --> 23:03.460]  He plays like a very like counter character, like in real his real self.
[23:03.700 --> 23:06.740]  But he's a dick and he's just like a self-entitled asshole.
[23:07.020 --> 23:07.740]  Nick, I got news for you.
[23:07.860 --> 23:11.660]  I did an event with him once where he was he was like one of the hosts.
[23:11.800 --> 23:13.720]  He plays that role everywhere.
[23:15.420 --> 23:18.160]  Oh, no. He's typecast himself.
[23:18.240 --> 23:20.360]  Wow. What a great actor this guy is.
[23:20.560 --> 23:22.040]  Yes, I'm acting.
[23:22.940 --> 23:26.380]  I was like, get me the fuck away from this whole scene.
[23:27.060 --> 23:27.960]  Oh, man.
[23:30.160 --> 23:33.780]  You think when you're editing something like this, do you go like,
[23:33.920 --> 23:39.660]  do we put the Urkel dick rap before the serious people
[23:39.660 --> 23:42.080]  talking about their experience or do we do it after?
[23:42.860 --> 23:45.160]  Where does Sinbad fit in all of this?
[23:45.300 --> 23:49.140]  These are decisions Malcolm Jamal Warner handled and handled artfully.
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.180]  Was it Friday night videos he did, right?
[23:54.080 --> 23:55.540]  I don't know what that is.
[23:57.100 --> 23:59.040]  It was like a.
[24:02.100 --> 24:07.140]  It was just like a music video thing.
[24:07.740 --> 24:10.480]  Like, I don't know another way to describe it.
[24:11.100 --> 24:12.400]  No, that's fine. Yeah, I get it.
[24:12.580 --> 24:15.440]  It was just like he was the host and it would be on Friday night
[24:15.440 --> 24:17.880]  from like 11 to midnight and they would just play videos.
[24:18.120 --> 24:20.760]  Yeah, music, music videos and like sometimes like live.
[24:20.860 --> 24:21.860]  I feel like live performance.
[24:21.860 --> 24:23.340]  Yeah, and they'd have like interviews and stuff.
[24:23.420 --> 24:25.740]  It looked like this is the only image I can find of it.
[24:29.700 --> 24:31.720]  Oh, I recognize that logo now.
[24:33.000 --> 24:34.960]  Never seen it, but yeah.
[24:41.600 --> 24:41.980]  Jesus.
[24:43.420 --> 24:45.480]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, they're still hanging out here, huh?
[24:49.400 --> 24:51.300]  It's talking about Arsenio Hall yesterday.
[24:52.320 --> 24:56.740]  How I wish there was a court show that had his audience when he had a talk show.
[24:57.220 --> 25:00.240]  It'd be such a great like the the barking thing.
[25:03.040 --> 25:05.300]  Barking's back, dude, is it?
[25:05.480 --> 25:07.700]  Oh, dude, barking's back big time.
[25:07.880 --> 25:11.020]  Like, I think you're going to start hearing it in sports over like the next year.
[25:11.140 --> 25:11.860]  Barking's back.
[25:12.360 --> 25:13.040]  What do you mean, barking?
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.560]  Yeah, dude, in wrestling, barking's back.
[25:15.700 --> 25:18.380]  We got like five different guys who got like bark stuff going on,
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.240]  and we did not it like six months ago.
[25:20.320 --> 25:21.960]  It rocks. Barking's so back.
[25:22.740 --> 25:23.700]  What are you talking about?
[25:25.040 --> 25:25.780]  People are barking.
[25:26.160 --> 25:27.720]  What do you mean, what are you talking about? Yeah.
[25:28.940 --> 25:30.460]  Like making noise like a dog?
[25:30.920 --> 25:31.480]  Yeah. Yeah.
[25:31.480 --> 25:34.140]  Well, I didn't know how to categorize your Arsenio Hall thing.
[25:34.200 --> 25:35.160]  He was barking, right?
[25:35.440 --> 25:38.120]  Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
[25:38.120 --> 25:39.860]  And all the audience would do that? Yeah.
[25:40.360 --> 25:42.520]  Yep. I was going to say, is it more of a woof-woof or a bow-wow?
[25:44.220 --> 25:45.060]  It's like barking, dude.
[25:45.060 --> 25:46.800]  For 2024, it's whatever you want it to be, man.
[25:47.160 --> 25:47.720]  Oh, nice.
[25:48.260 --> 25:50.660]  I think this might be some of the footage where I've seen
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.880]  the most of in relation to participative in the least.
[25:56.800 --> 25:57.120]  What?
[25:58.120 --> 25:59.780]  I've just seen people work out a ton.
[26:00.340 --> 26:01.280]  You've played basketball?
[26:01.720 --> 26:02.460]  You've played basketball?
[26:03.680 --> 26:04.560]  You've done this?
[26:05.160 --> 26:06.960]  You wanna shoot hoops, Gavin?
[26:07.840 --> 26:08.960]  Yeah, Gavin, you wanna go shoot hoops?
[26:09.580 --> 26:10.380]  Do I have to run around?
[26:11.500 --> 26:12.980]  No, I mean, we just...
[26:13.520 --> 26:16.980]  Aren't you the one that wanted to challenge Nick to a foot race?
[26:17.280 --> 26:18.600]  What do you mean, do I have to run around?
[26:24.850 --> 26:25.490]  Yeah, what was it?
[26:25.650 --> 26:27.030]  Was we gonna do a 1500 or something?
[26:27.030 --> 26:27.510]  What?
[26:28.410 --> 26:30.810]  I don't remember, is that it?
[26:31.070 --> 26:33.210]  I just wanna see you guys sprint at full speed
[26:33.210 --> 26:34.030]  and slow motion.
[26:36.670 --> 26:38.090]  I gotta start eating better.
[26:39.910 --> 26:41.490]  Oh, that reminds me, I was listening to our podcast
[26:41.490 --> 26:43.210]  today, and I gotta get a new puzzle for us.
[26:43.930 --> 26:44.230]  Yes.
[26:45.030 --> 26:46.510]  Do you want me to make a note, remind you, or what?
[26:46.730 --> 26:47.510]  Are you gonna do it?
[26:47.670 --> 26:50.210]  Yeah, I'll need a note. I'm looking right now, but I'll need a note.
[26:50.530 --> 26:51.470]  I gotcha, I'll make a note.
[26:54.410 --> 26:55.370]  Oh, that's pretty.
[26:55.370 --> 26:57.630]  Are you looking at puzzles?
[26:57.630 --> 26:58.930]  Don't look at puzzles right now.
[26:59.190 --> 26:59.650]  I'm watching AIDS.
[27:03.170 --> 27:04.170]  So, what was pretty?
[27:05.510 --> 27:07.490]  Uh, Carrie's hair. She's got pretty hair.
[27:10.330 --> 27:11.350]  What year was this?
[27:13.030 --> 27:14.390]  1992, I think.
[27:14.490 --> 27:16.270]  Oh, I bet this was 91, 92, yeah.
[27:16.650 --> 27:17.790]  I mean, I bet that's it.
[27:18.150 --> 27:19.070]  I think it said 92.
[27:19.770 --> 27:21.070]  She's like mid-50s now.
[27:21.070 --> 27:23.390]  He looks like a quarterback
[27:23.390 --> 27:25.010]  that Cardinals would draft
[27:25.010 --> 27:26.350]  at like 7th overall
[27:26.350 --> 27:28.730]  and was never that great.
[27:29.950 --> 27:31.190]  By the hot tub party?
[27:31.430 --> 27:32.150]  That's pretty good.
[27:32.530 --> 27:35.370]  I don't know about that, he just exudes Cardinal first round pick.
[27:35.590 --> 27:36.450]  That wasn't good.
[27:37.530 --> 27:39.630]  Oh, how are you guys feeling about kicker picker right now?
[27:40.490 --> 27:41.490]  I keep getting
[27:41.490 --> 27:42.550]  kickers hurt.
[27:42.870 --> 27:45.270]  I hate it, but although if any of us was gonna have
[27:45.270 --> 27:47.230]  a kicker picker issue, it should probably be me.
[27:47.690 --> 27:48.250]  Yeah, I agree.
[27:48.590 --> 27:50.990]  I'm like middle of the road. I think I'm in third place.
[27:50.990 --> 27:51.810]  Like, whatever.
[27:54.430 --> 27:55.350]  Feeling pretty bad.
[27:55.850 --> 27:57.230]  Yeah, Nick is also down a kicker.
[27:58.790 --> 27:59.350]  I'm in a real
[27:59.350 --> 28:01.290]  fucked up place where one of my kickers got
[28:01.290 --> 28:02.970]  hurt and I'm hoping the kicker that got
[28:02.970 --> 28:04.410]  fired gets his job.
[28:05.290 --> 28:05.690]  Wow.
[28:07.610 --> 28:09.150]  Should we, like when
[28:09.150 --> 28:10.950]  we're halfway through the season, should like
[28:10.950 --> 28:12.910]  we talked about the bottom like
[28:12.910 --> 28:13.630]  redrafting?
[28:14.450 --> 28:15.570]  Yes, please.
[28:18.330 --> 28:19.150]  Yeah, this might
[28:19.150 --> 28:21.110]  be good. I think maybe this is the way we do it.
[28:21.190 --> 28:22.970]  We get to- Like week 8 or 9?
[28:23.530 --> 28:24.510]  Yeah, when is week 8?
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.440]  Sinbad is
[28:31.440 --> 28:33.620]  in the store right across from this. There's a condom.
[28:34.940 --> 28:35.560]  Okay, we-
[28:35.560 --> 28:37.360]  October 27th. Do you think this is the same
[28:37.360 --> 28:38.460]  mall that Pauly Shore
[28:39.500 --> 28:40.560]  was walking around?
[28:48.600 --> 28:49.520]  Wow, that steering wheel
[28:49.520 --> 28:50.280]  will kill someone.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.380]  Gonna put a kicker picker redraft
[28:55.380 --> 28:57.500]  on everyone's calendar. That's a Mustang.
[28:58.700 --> 28:59.100]  Yeah.
[29:00.080 --> 29:01.180]  Do you think of anything
[29:01.180 --> 29:02.840]  specific when you see a steering wheel?
[29:04.220 --> 29:04.980]  A car?
[29:05.380 --> 29:05.660]  Yeah.
[29:11.460 --> 29:12.260]  So stupid.
[29:14.180 --> 29:14.580]  Car.
[29:16.560 --> 29:19.260]  What were you driving at here, Drew?
[29:19.820 --> 29:21.180]  Every time I see a steering wheel
[29:21.180 --> 29:23.040]  I think of the scene in Gone in 60
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.100]  Seconds where he takes the wheel off and puts
[29:25.100 --> 29:27.160]  a new wheel on to steal the car.
[29:27.160 --> 29:28.320]  Every time.
[29:29.220 --> 29:31.160]  Cause it has like one of those brake
[29:31.160 --> 29:33.220]  thing- you know like those jammers on the wheel?
[29:34.180 --> 29:34.720]  The club?
[29:35.280 --> 29:35.960]  Yeah, the club.
[29:36.640 --> 29:39.040]  They're like stealing cars that has a club on the wheel.
[29:39.480 --> 29:41.120]  So he just rips the fucking wheel off
[29:41.120 --> 29:43.220]  and puts a new wheel on. And then drives
[29:43.220 --> 29:45.380]  away. Hey, Christy Alley!
[29:48.810 --> 29:50.890]  She learned a lot about IV drug users.
[29:51.030 --> 29:51.730]  Look at her read.
[29:52.690 --> 29:54.830]  What do you think her best performance was?
[29:55.910 --> 29:56.850]  Look who's talking.
[29:56.850 --> 29:57.430]  Cheers.
[30:00.290 --> 30:02.910]  Is the camera turning and also her head is
[30:02.910 --> 30:03.170]  turning?
[30:03.850 --> 30:06.030]  I got dizzy looking at that shot.
[30:06.750 --> 30:08.610]  She was getting Star Trek.
[30:15.900 --> 30:17.600]  Johnny Chill ever take off?
[30:19.400 --> 30:20.620]  It's Johnny Gil.
[30:21.120 --> 30:21.380]  Gil?
[30:22.380 --> 30:23.540]  He's a singer.
[30:24.000 --> 30:24.600]  Oh, I didn't know.
[30:25.060 --> 30:27.140]  He took off. He was a whole thing.
[30:27.620 --> 30:28.560]  Didn't know that.
[30:28.560 --> 30:30.280]  He was in...
[30:31.240 --> 30:32.160]  Fuck, what was he in?
[30:32.180 --> 30:33.160]  He was in New Edition, right?
[30:34.260 --> 30:35.340]  Yeah, Johnny Gil was in New Edition.
[30:35.500 --> 30:36.620]  Yeah, he was in New Edition.
[30:43.390 --> 30:43.850]  What?
[30:44.050 --> 30:46.290]  No thanks.
[30:47.870 --> 30:49.810]  The healthiest meal is no meal.
[30:54.030 --> 30:55.670]  That's what the Texas legislature said.
[30:56.430 --> 30:57.510]  That map was upside down.
[31:06.380 --> 31:08.940]  This is such American sex education.
[31:08.940 --> 31:10.220]  Hey, don't do it.
[31:10.760 --> 31:12.380]  I agree with it.
[31:12.460 --> 31:13.760]  That's why I still haven't.
[31:14.320 --> 31:15.460]  I'm going to keep it going.
[31:15.760 --> 31:18.980]  Did you see that Lisa Marie Presley
[31:18.980 --> 31:20.200]  said that in her
[31:20.760 --> 31:22.800]  memoir that Michael Jackson was a
[31:22.800 --> 31:24.040]  virgin when they got married?
[31:24.660 --> 31:25.040]  Really?
[31:25.400 --> 31:26.460]  Like 34 or whatever.
[31:28.720 --> 31:30.860]  He's doing it in solidarity with Magic Johnson.
[31:32.340 --> 31:33.980]  There's hope for me yet.
[31:34.500 --> 31:36.280]  I better see him in this PSA then.
[31:42.180 --> 31:42.740]  Everyone
[31:43.920 --> 31:45.440]  here is like
[31:45.440 --> 31:47.280]  high school, college age,
[31:48.800 --> 31:49.920]  but like
[31:50.680 --> 31:51.660]  they look
[31:51.660 --> 31:52.740]  older than...
[31:54.060 --> 31:54.220]  They do.
[31:55.200 --> 31:56.940]  I don't know if it's like the hair
[31:56.940 --> 31:58.940]  or just like the look or what, but
[31:58.940 --> 32:00.140]  they look older.
[32:00.140 --> 32:03.700]  It's possible that a lot of these people look younger now
[32:04.380 --> 32:05.680]  than they do at the time
[32:05.680 --> 32:06.700]  in which this is filmed.
[32:07.300 --> 32:08.820]  Cosplaying their parents it looks like.
[32:08.820 --> 32:09.300]  Yeah.
[32:18.560 --> 32:20.060]  That guy's old, man.
[32:25.070 --> 32:26.130]  That's definitely like
[32:26.130 --> 32:27.490]  he's got like a quarterback look.
[32:27.610 --> 32:29.470]  Yeah, he's a Brock Purdy type guy.
[32:29.790 --> 32:32.030]  So everyone here we're looking at is in their 50s
[32:32.030 --> 32:32.290]  now.
[32:32.630 --> 32:34.610]  About my age.
[32:36.650 --> 32:38.230]  Is this what I looked like in 1992?
[32:38.850 --> 32:38.870]  Fuck.
[32:43.610 --> 32:45.590]  Yeah, you look like that guy at the bottom left there
[32:45.590 --> 32:47.430]  with the haircut. Yeah, that's you.
[32:48.210 --> 32:49.310]  I would have been
[32:49.310 --> 32:51.010]  16? 17?
[32:53.110 --> 32:53.810]  That's nuts.
[32:59.920 --> 33:01.560]  Not MCT. Ice cream?
[33:08.280 --> 33:08.880]  Yeah!
[33:09.180 --> 33:09.780]  Yeah!
[33:16.190 --> 33:17.590]  I'm gonna get Gavin to rap.
[33:18.090 --> 33:18.970]  This is how I'm gonna do it.
[33:19.470 --> 33:21.750]  I'm gonna say ice cream and DJ Grinch.
[33:22.630 --> 33:24.230]  Gavin, you have to rap.
[33:24.490 --> 33:25.650]  Blindside, rap this.
[33:26.790 --> 33:27.270]  Oh.
[33:29.710 --> 33:31.170]  Blindside, you have to do my taxes.
[33:32.370 --> 33:33.410]  Oh, I'll do that.
[33:34.110 --> 33:35.650]  A-Dog!
[33:41.080 --> 33:43.600]  Did Arsenio ever have a music career?
[33:44.120 --> 33:45.620]  Oh boy, I bet we could
[33:45.620 --> 33:46.300]  find an album.
[33:48.180 --> 33:49.620]  Like, I feel like this might be
[33:49.620 --> 33:51.580]  him being like, I want to do this
[33:51.580 --> 33:53.480]  but I'm not gonna like straight up
[33:53.480 --> 33:55.620]  declare it, so this is...
[33:58.660 --> 34:00.020]  I can't remember if I
[34:00.020 --> 34:01.780]  said the movie they were in was called
[34:01.780 --> 34:03.720]  White Nights or Harlem Nights. Those are both two movies.
[34:03.860 --> 34:05.360]  But it was Harlem Nights in case I got it wrong.
[34:05.700 --> 34:06.960]  You kept saying White Nights.
[34:07.260 --> 34:09.980]  White Nights is a different movie with, I think, Gregory Hines
[34:09.980 --> 34:11.440]  and, uh...
[34:11.440 --> 34:12.260]  Who was in that?
[34:14.960 --> 34:15.500]  You just
[34:15.920 --> 34:16.580]  Brimley'd it a little bit?
[34:17.840 --> 34:19.700]  Yeah, I guess I did.
[34:21.220 --> 34:21.940]  Similar... well, not
[34:21.940 --> 34:23.340]  similar movie. White Nights is about dancing.
[34:28.340 --> 34:29.240]  Yeah, you were close.
[34:30.620 --> 34:32.380]  But I meant Harlem Nights.
[34:32.540 --> 34:34.500]  White Nights I also remember being good, but...
[34:34.500 --> 34:36.780]  Oh, I remember White Nights
[34:36.780 --> 34:38.980]  with Baryshnikov.
[34:39.320 --> 34:40.600]  Yeah, and Gregory Hines.
[34:42.200 --> 34:44.520]  And it was like a Russia-America
[34:44.520 --> 34:46.740]  thing where they learned to respect
[34:46.740 --> 34:48.740]  each other on the dance floor
[34:48.740 --> 34:49.100]  or whatever.
[34:50.440 --> 34:51.480]  How funny.
[34:51.620 --> 34:53.840]  Wow, this song is going on for a while.
[34:54.600 --> 34:56.700]  Arsenio Hall had a comedy rap album
[34:56.700 --> 34:58.540]  released under the name of his
[34:58.540 --> 34:59.580]  Chunky A.
[35:00.360 --> 35:02.840]  Oh my god, Chunky A!
[35:03.040 --> 35:03.240]  Yeah.
[35:04.100 --> 35:05.680]  I remember that!
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.940]  Oh, I bet that doesn't age well.
[35:10.500 --> 35:12.340]  No, no, no, no.
[35:18.300 --> 35:19.740]  Oh my god.
[35:20.260 --> 35:22.480]  All the people filming in this style in the early
[35:22.480 --> 35:24.360]  days must have really bad backs now.
[35:24.900 --> 35:25.120]  Yeah.
[35:25.860 --> 35:27.420]  There's Chunky A album.
[35:27.960 --> 35:30.400]  It's not like cameras were very,
[35:30.400 --> 35:32.340]  very light. You know what I mean?
[35:32.720 --> 35:34.000]  And they're like
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.920]  racking the zoom left and right.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.220]  But it's a team effort because
[35:40.220 --> 35:42.560]  it's them and the guys
[35:42.560 --> 35:44.360]  whipping lights back and forth.
[35:45.020 --> 35:46.280]  You think that's all manual?
[35:46.820 --> 35:47.000]  Yeah.
[35:48.880 --> 35:50.080]  In 91?
[35:50.600 --> 35:50.900]  Yeah.
[35:51.800 --> 35:53.660]  That might be the best photo of Arsenio Hall ever.
[35:58.100 --> 35:59.760]  On this budget, it's a guy
[35:59.760 --> 36:01.740]  whipping the light back and forth, no doubt.
[36:04.960 --> 36:07.740]  Man, we loved to put words on cards in the 90s,
[36:07.760 --> 36:08.060]  didn't we?
[36:11.160 --> 36:13.480]  Kind of looks like the Terminator when the lights go off.
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.060]  Come on, come on.
[36:27.540 --> 36:28.100]  Oh, Kat!
[36:28.760 --> 36:29.740]  I'm about to go SMI mode.
[36:30.980 --> 36:31.860]  Taking a shit?
[36:35.420 --> 36:36.640]  Color me bad.
[36:36.960 --> 36:37.700]  Yeah, it is.
[36:37.700 --> 36:40.240]  That dude wants to be George Michael
[36:40.240 --> 36:41.420]  so fucking bad.
[36:42.880 --> 36:45.660]  Which, I think
[36:45.660 --> 36:47.660]  that guy is still going around doing
[36:47.660 --> 36:48.600]  color me bad stuff.
[36:48.940 --> 36:51.080]  I just saw a TikTok of him live.
[36:55.190 --> 36:56.250]  They had a song.
[36:56.990 --> 36:57.190]  Yeah.
[36:58.770 --> 37:00.190]  And it was about sexing you up.
[37:00.610 --> 37:01.670]  And how they wanted to do that.
[37:03.490 --> 37:04.190]  You think having
[37:04.190 --> 37:06.310]  the color me bad segment be black and white
[37:06.310 --> 37:08.110]  was an intentional choice?
[37:19.300 --> 37:20.680]  Back to the cosplaying.
[37:21.180 --> 37:22.780]  That lady is either a teen
[37:22.780 --> 37:23.640]  or 38.
[37:24.240 --> 37:26.140]  No in between.
[37:26.420 --> 37:28.480]  She's either an 18 or she's a
[37:28.480 --> 37:30.680]  mid-level manager at a local bank.
[37:31.120 --> 37:33.180]  Where are they getting all these quarterbacks?
[37:35.600 --> 37:37.640]  Was that just a look?
[37:39.040 --> 37:41.440]  Was Ohio a hotbed for quarterbacks?
[37:41.740 --> 37:43.580]  That shirt and that haircut
[37:43.580 --> 37:46.140]  were the fucking look in 1992.
[37:56.950 --> 37:58.310]  Is she getting tested for AIDS?
[37:58.810 --> 37:59.110]  Yeah.
[38:07.840 --> 38:09.760]  That guy dresses the same now.
[38:10.000 --> 38:10.400]  Guaranteed.
[38:12.560 --> 38:13.740]  Didn't they used to have to test
[38:13.740 --> 38:15.720]  for stuff with a Q-tip down the old...
[38:16.640 --> 38:17.620]  Oh my god, really?
[38:17.800 --> 38:18.620]  Did they? Yes.
[38:18.940 --> 38:20.060]  Not in my lifetime.
[38:20.860 --> 38:22.460]  I thought AIDS would have been a blood test.
[38:23.160 --> 38:23.960]  Not AIDS.
[38:24.280 --> 38:26.140]  Maybe for chlamydia or something.
[38:28.020 --> 38:28.940]  Yeah, one of those.
[38:28.960 --> 38:31.060]  I think I have an unfortunate thing to tell you about your doctor.
[38:33.100 --> 38:34.500]  That's not my ear!
[38:34.640 --> 38:35.140]  That's not my ear!
[38:35.240 --> 38:35.820]  That's not my ear!
[38:43.510 --> 38:45.210]  How much was an AIDS test?
[38:46.890 --> 38:47.530]  How much?
[38:47.710 --> 38:49.210]  I don't think I ever had to pay for one.
[38:49.430 --> 38:50.310]  No, I don't think so either.
[38:51.230 --> 38:52.590]  Yeah, I think it's covered with insurance.
[38:53.070 --> 38:54.730]  Not even insurance? You just got a Planned Parenthood.
[38:55.150 --> 38:55.370]  Yeah.
[38:56.630 --> 38:57.710]  How non-American?
[38:58.250 --> 39:00.670]  I did that maybe...
[39:00.670 --> 39:01.970]  I don't know,
[39:02.150 --> 39:03.630]  18 years ago just for the hell of it.
[39:04.130 --> 39:05.690]  You got an AIDS test 10 years ago?
[39:06.930 --> 39:07.650]  Maybe 7.
[39:07.770 --> 39:08.970]  Whenever I got
[39:10.070 --> 39:11.510]  divorced and started dating again,
[39:11.970 --> 39:14.010]  I went and got a full round of tests
[39:14.010 --> 39:15.130]  and stuff, but I went to Planned Parenthood.
[39:15.230 --> 39:15.990]  It was super easy to do.
[39:16.690 --> 39:18.810]  And you're right, Andrew, it is very un-American
[39:18.810 --> 39:20.590]  and that's why people want to keep defunding it
[39:20.590 --> 39:23.030]  and they protest in front of it and blow them up.
[39:23.670 --> 39:23.790]  Yeah.
[39:25.470 --> 39:26.510]  Oh, what's up? It's Chris!
[39:38.130 --> 39:38.850]  He's bragging.
[39:39.150 --> 39:39.950]  Yeah, I don't want to brag.
[39:39.950 --> 39:40.950]  Jesus Christ.
[39:41.330 --> 39:43.610]  Wow, that's...
[39:43.610 --> 39:45.670]  How old is this guy?
[39:46.270 --> 39:47.430]  Hee hee hee hee.
[39:47.630 --> 39:49.890]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[39:50.730 --> 39:52.070]  Yeah, he's really
[39:52.070 --> 39:52.970]  staring down that poster.
[39:55.290 --> 39:55.850]  Crazy.
[39:56.050 --> 39:56.910]  Another QB!
[39:57.310 --> 39:58.230]  Another quarterback!
[39:58.970 --> 40:00.570]  Kurt Cousins looking motherfucker!
[40:02.050 --> 40:03.810]  He's got better hair than Kurt Cousins.
[40:03.930 --> 40:05.810]  So I'm saying, like, Gavin, that's the thing.
[40:05.870 --> 40:07.230]  It's the haircut in the jaw.
[40:07.230 --> 40:08.470]  It's the head shape.
[40:08.790 --> 40:10.730]  Yeah, big time. Big square heads.
[40:14.980 --> 40:15.760]  I saw that
[40:16.560 --> 40:17.920]  there's an air hockey league
[40:17.920 --> 40:19.860]  now. What? Oh yeah?
[40:20.500 --> 40:21.060]  Yeah, somewhere.
[40:21.680 --> 40:22.500]  It's not on Reddit, I think.
[40:25.740 --> 40:26.080]  And that
[40:26.080 --> 40:26.980]  doesn't shock me.
[40:27.440 --> 40:28.600]  It's a league for most things.
[40:29.220 --> 40:31.660]  I wonder if they get any coverage, like ESPN or
[40:32.400 --> 40:33.480]  ESPN 3 or whatever.
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.720]  Not yet, but I'll bet
[40:35.720 --> 40:36.960]  Pickleball's pretty close to it.
[40:39.960 --> 40:41.460]  You know, Pickleball's been around for like
[40:41.980 --> 40:43.980]  50 fucking years. Oh really?
[40:44.440 --> 40:45.960]  Yeah, it was invented in like
[40:45.960 --> 40:47.940]  the 60s. Or the
[40:47.940 --> 40:50.240]  70s, but I think like late 60s.
[40:50.420 --> 40:51.860]  It's just like full court
[40:52.360 --> 40:53.820]  ping pong? Is that what it is?
[40:53.940 --> 40:55.900]  Yeah, it's like easy
[40:55.900 --> 40:57.780]  mode tennis. I have no
[40:58.140 --> 40:59.900]  qualms with it at all. I've played it about
[40:59.900 --> 41:01.940]  as much as I've played tennis. It's one and the same.
[41:02.020 --> 41:03.880]  It's like, if you want to play tennis and you don't
[41:03.880 --> 41:06.100]  feel like running or lunging,
[41:06.200 --> 41:07.480]  you know what I mean? You can play Pickleball.
[41:07.480 --> 41:09.540]  But it's weird to me
[41:09.540 --> 41:11.620]  that it's been around for so long
[41:11.620 --> 41:13.180]  and then it took off all at once
[41:13.180 --> 41:15.540]  five years ago. Should we play?
[41:16.340 --> 41:17.140]  Yeah, we should.
[41:17.360 --> 41:19.120]  Should we play doubles? Yes.
[41:19.320 --> 41:21.580]  Yes, we should. I think I have
[41:21.580 --> 41:22.780]  a full set.
[41:23.560 --> 41:25.480]  Who are the team captains?
[41:28.260 --> 41:29.360]  Maybe that's how we'll beat,
[41:29.420 --> 41:30.200]  how we'll finish Feud.
[41:32.580 --> 41:33.520]  The winners get
[41:33.520 --> 41:35.000]  to be team captains in Pickleball?
[41:35.660 --> 41:36.100]  No.
[41:36.700 --> 41:38.060]  Our team against their team, dummy.
[41:40.120 --> 41:42.560]  You need to open your door and your windows.
[41:43.500 --> 41:44.920]  Stop breathing in shit.
[41:45.440 --> 41:47.080]  So we just don't play the third round?
[41:47.960 --> 41:49.060]  No, we're playing the third
[41:49.060 --> 41:49.340]  round.
[41:51.320 --> 41:53.080]  I just don't have enough survey
[41:53.080 --> 41:54.680]  questions to do the third round.
[41:54.960 --> 41:55.940]  I need to do another one.
[41:57.100 --> 41:58.920]  Is this a blind side of convenience?
[41:59.760 --> 42:00.060]  Yes.
[42:01.020 --> 42:03.160]  No, we're running out of time
[42:03.160 --> 42:05.160]  in the year, and I wanted to make sure I got mine off.
[42:06.580 --> 42:07.240]  I feel like you
[42:07.240 --> 42:09.120]  just keep adding them. I feel like you already did them.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.060]  Mine was last year, right?
[42:11.280 --> 42:13.080]  Yep, you still have. Everyone else, everyone
[42:13.080 --> 42:14.380]  here has. Both.
[42:14.900 --> 42:15.920]  Yeah, we're considerate.
[42:17.400 --> 42:18.980]  I thought the Littlest Hobo was this year.
[42:19.080 --> 42:19.720]  Was that last year?
[42:20.620 --> 42:21.460]  It was last year.
[42:22.660 --> 42:25.020]  Just don't think about it too much. Oh, no, no, we reset is
[42:25.020 --> 42:27.060]  when we... Oh, okay.
[42:27.220 --> 42:29.020]  Yeah, here's the wrong answer, and then hang on,
[42:29.100 --> 42:31.240]  here's the right answer. Oh, it's over!
[42:31.240 --> 42:33.300]  Written by Thad Mumford. See, we could've
[42:33.300 --> 42:34.360]  got all that information here.
[42:35.460 --> 42:37.620]  Yeah, why didn't we just wait 30 minutes?
[42:38.040 --> 42:38.960]  We could've just made it
[42:38.960 --> 42:41.360]  to the end. Wow, a lot of audio
[42:41.360 --> 42:43.220]  engineers. That was a star
[42:44.360 --> 42:45.200]  studded PSA.
[42:45.340 --> 42:46.700]  Oh, great PSA.
[42:47.200 --> 42:47.600]  Interesting.
[42:49.240 --> 42:51.320]  Star studded for the era. Obviously, probably half
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.020]  those people y'all don't know, but for
[42:53.020 --> 42:55.040]  somebody who grew up in the 80s and 90s, that was
[42:55.040 --> 42:56.740]  fucking... They really went all out.
[42:57.120 --> 42:59.180]  Yeah. For the time. Gavin,
[42:59.180 --> 42:59.800]  did you learn a lot?
[43:02.820 --> 43:03.220]  Um...
[43:03.220 --> 43:05.140]  Uh-oh, the cat. Uh-oh. I thought maybe
[43:05.140 --> 43:06.780]  the cat smell got to him. I thought he was done.
[43:08.240 --> 43:09.040]  Okay. Okay,
[43:09.180 --> 43:10.500]  match three, that's not how... Match three!
[43:10.780 --> 43:13.620]  No. Went to AIDS education.
[43:14.360 --> 43:15.300]  Winner. I thought the question
[43:15.300 --> 43:17.400]  mark was unveiled as AIDS education.
[43:18.120 --> 43:19.000]  Ha ha ha!
[43:20.240 --> 43:21.120]  Well, thank you
[43:21.120 --> 43:23.580]  so much for watching another Blindside.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.260]  I had a lot of fun.
[43:25.600 --> 43:27.260]  It was fun having this be rescheduled
[43:27.260 --> 43:28.860]  multiple times and me internally going,
[43:29.080 --> 43:30.620]  yeah, it's fine. It's not a priority.
[43:30.760 --> 43:32.180]  We'll get to this when we get to it.
[43:33.900 --> 43:35.180]  Make sure you check out

[43:45.060 --> 43:46.760]  for the first time and they just see

[43:49.020 --> 43:51.220]  Yep. Also, be on the

[43:53.140 --> 43:54.500]  we try to start fires.
[43:55.060 --> 43:56.460]  Oh, I forgot about
[43:56.460 --> 43:57.520]  fire incense stuff!
[43:57.700 --> 44:00.340]  We're going to try to set everything on fire with
[44:00.340 --> 44:02.300]  lit incense and see how successful we are.
[44:02.420 --> 44:04.060]  That'll be coming sometime in the next six months.
[44:04.800 --> 44:05.260]  Sounds good.
[44:06.400 --> 44:07.860]  We'll talk to y'all later.
[44:08.400 --> 44:08.880]  Bye!
