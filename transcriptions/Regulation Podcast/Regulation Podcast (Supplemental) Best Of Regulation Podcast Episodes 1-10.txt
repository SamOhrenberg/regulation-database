[00:00.000 --> 00:01.820]  Hello and welcome to an-
[00:02.400 --> 00:04.560]  Hello and welcome to the first ep-
[00:04.560 --> 00:04.860]  What?
[00:05.280 --> 00:08.520]  I mean, don't swear right at the- at the gate. I mean, that doesn't help us.
[00:08.520 --> 00:09.480]  Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10.520 --> 00:10.920]  S**t.
[00:11.780 --> 00:12.180]  Dumb.
[00:13.460 --> 00:14.380]  No, shut up!
[00:15.200 --> 00:16.300]  What are we doing, Geoff?
[00:16.440 --> 00:17.200]  Should we start it?
[00:17.620 --> 00:17.740]  Yeah.
[00:19.000 --> 00:19.800]  Hello-
[00:19.800 --> 00:20.220]  God.
[00:24.340 --> 00:29.940]  Uh, hey, I wanted to do something a little special because this is an inaugural episode.
[00:29.940 --> 00:32.480]  So I, uh, I've been working on something in the background.
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.220]  Something I kind of teased in the past.
[00:34.780 --> 00:37.380]  I- I proposed as an idea, I won't say how long ago,
[00:37.480 --> 00:40.860]  but, you know, somewhere in the last 206, uh, 205 episodes.
[00:41.700 --> 00:45.320]  And, uh, I would like- I don't- I- I think I should just give it to you guys
[00:45.320 --> 00:47.760]  and let you all, like, sync up and play it yourselves.
[00:48.420 --> 00:50.220]  But I prepared a little- a little file.
[00:52.260 --> 00:53.920]  Oh, come on, dude!
[00:55.920 --> 00:56.640]  Come on!
[00:56.840 --> 00:58.320]  Oh, it's so loud, too!
[00:58.320 --> 00:59.880]  You know why it's loud?
[01:00.020 --> 01:01.620]  Because it sounds like a waterfall!
[01:01.940 --> 01:02.640]  It works!
[01:04.280 --> 01:04.820]  Hang on.
[01:06.260 --> 01:07.760]  It sounds like a water feature.
[01:08.180 --> 01:12.120]  Eric yells at me for saying shit at the first 30 seconds of the show,
[01:12.240 --> 01:15.560]  and Geoff is just sharing 55 seconds of piss.
[01:16.020 --> 01:19.020]  Yeah, but- but algorithmically, that's not gonna get picked up by-
[01:19.020 --> 01:19.460]  I don't care.
[01:19.460 --> 01:19.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:20.600 --> 01:23.360]  You don't think the AI is listening out for piss?
[01:24.760 --> 01:26.680]  No. Oh, now we get to hear the dribbles.
[01:26.680 --> 01:29.140]  Oh, they go for so long. Please listen.
[01:29.560 --> 01:31.120]  I prepared this specially for you.
[01:31.260 --> 01:35.760]  Geoff, I- this is- I find this deeply disturbing in a way I did not anticipate.
[01:36.500 --> 01:36.940]  Excellent.
[01:37.420 --> 01:43.020]  Would you- if you paid $1,000, could you shoot a horse in the head?
[01:44.440 --> 01:44.880]  What?
[01:45.460 --> 01:48.720]  Wait, I have to pay to shoot the horse, or I get paid to shoot the horse?
[01:49.040 --> 01:50.300]  You pay to shoot the horse.
[01:51.000 --> 01:51.440]  What?
[01:53.760 --> 01:54.720]  Do I get in trouble?
[01:55.560 --> 01:56.000]  No.
[01:56.680 --> 02:02.140]  So it's like- like the $1,000 keeps me legally clear for horse murder?
[02:02.640 --> 02:04.040]  Is the horse ill in any way?
[02:04.740 --> 02:06.380]  No, the horse is perfectly healthy.
[02:06.400 --> 02:07.380]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[02:07.500 --> 02:08.340]  How old is the horse?
[02:08.780 --> 02:14.640]  I think I could go take out some horses and just get away with it. It's like $13,000 right there I'm saving.
[02:15.080 --> 02:15.980]  Oh my god.
[02:16.700 --> 02:19.020]  Why would I pay to kill a horse?
[02:19.240 --> 02:19.820]  Yeah, I don't-
[02:19.820 --> 02:27.120]  I'm glad you asked because it's Christopher Reeve's horse the night before he got paralyzed.
[02:27.260 --> 02:27.980]  Jesus Christ.
[02:28.040 --> 02:35.140]  It's like a- like a shoot baby Hitler in the bassinet kind of a scenario. You kill Superman's horse.
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.740]  Now would you pay the grand to go kill his horse? And you have eight seconds with the horse and you've brought a gun.
[02:43.720 --> 02:46.040]  You can't convince the horse in eight seconds not to do it.
[02:46.080 --> 02:47.900]  Yeah, and I don't think you could take it down barehanded.
[02:48.400 --> 02:49.480]  Yeah, I don't-
[02:49.480 --> 02:50.600]  I'm not killing a horse.
[02:50.960 --> 02:52.220]  So you wouldn't do it?
[02:52.320 --> 02:53.800]  So you're killing Christopher Reeve then?
[02:54.240 --> 02:54.400]  Yeah.
[02:55.100 --> 03:04.620]  No, it's just, you know. Can I tell, just as an aside, one of my favorite- I actually have a horse shooting story that I've brought with Joy for years.
[03:04.960 --> 03:05.600]  Not a real horse.
[03:07.600 --> 03:15.640]  But I do have- this touches into one of my favorite memories, which I know it sounds horrible in this context.
[03:15.980 --> 03:17.460]  We're going to unravel this onion.
[03:18.140 --> 03:21.920]  Back in Red Dead Redemption, I don't know, did you guys play much of Red Dead online?
[03:22.160 --> 03:24.320]  Yeah, I used to do a ton of videos in it and shit.
[03:24.580 --> 03:29.580]  They had- there's a heist. Like, you could do heists in that game, essentially, of like, Wild West stuff.
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.780]  And we're like, reading the mission objective, and while we're doing it, my friend Dan, you can just hear,
[03:35.140 --> 03:37.920]  Pop! Pop! Pop!
[03:38.120 --> 03:40.580]  And we look at him, and we go, what are you doing?
[03:40.880 --> 03:42.220]  And he's like, I'm stopping him.
[03:42.460 --> 03:46.040]  He was shooting all of the horses on the carriage in the head.
[03:46.040 --> 03:52.420]  Because he thought- he thought that that was, like, the police's carriage that they would chase us on.
[03:52.760 --> 03:59.020]  It was our carriage. He murdered three of our four horses before we even tried to escape.
[03:59.300 --> 04:03.880]  And so I was driving around from, like, place to place running errands the other day.
[04:03.940 --> 04:07.580]  And I was in Emily's car because I had to pick something up or drop something off.
[04:07.600 --> 04:08.920]  And she's got a bigger car than I do.
[04:09.820 --> 04:15.280]  And I was- I don't know, it was one of those days where I was just completely and totally lost in my-
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.820]  You know those days when you're just, like, you're concentrating and thinking so hard about stuff
[04:19.820 --> 04:22.660]  that everything else you're doing is kind of on autopilot?
[04:23.020 --> 04:23.600]  You know what I mean?
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.600]  You're using, like, 5% of your brain to operate the human and the rest of it is just completely and totally trying to figure out
[04:30.360 --> 04:33.920]  finances or life moves or whatever it is.
[04:34.580 --> 04:36.220]  And I realized I had to get gas.
[04:36.340 --> 04:37.700]  And so I stopped at a gas station.
[04:38.760 --> 04:44.620]  And I went out and I put the thing in and I started filling up gas and I was standing there.
[04:45.200 --> 04:46.920]  And then I was like, oh, you know what would be nice?
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.220]  It would be nice if I got an energy drink because I'm fucking exhausted.
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.460]  And Emily would probably like one too.
[04:51.560 --> 04:55.640]  So I went inside and I bought two monster energy drinks.
[04:55.640 --> 04:57.320]  The ones that Eric likes to make fun of me for drinking.
[04:58.620 --> 05:09.800]  And, uh, bought those and went out and got in the car and drove away as normal.
[05:10.580 --> 05:13.540]  And, uh, about three miles down the road
[05:13.540 --> 05:17.980]  I thought to myself, something's not sitting right with me over the last few minutes.
[05:18.080 --> 05:18.920]  What is off?
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.800]  And I thought, you should pull over and figure this out.
[05:21.880 --> 05:24.140]  So I pulled over and I sat for about five seconds.
[05:24.260 --> 05:27.360]  And then I realized, oh, I never stopped getting gas.
[05:27.840 --> 05:29.520]  I just drove away.
[05:29.980 --> 05:30.780]  Oh my god.
[05:31.600 --> 05:33.000]  I get out of the car.
[05:33.180 --> 05:36.320]  I get out of the car and sure enough my gas cap is off.
[05:36.380 --> 05:38.100]  And the little thing is open.
[05:38.360 --> 05:39.500]  I'm like, holy fuck.
[05:39.920 --> 05:41.660]  Have I just...
[05:41.660 --> 05:43.700]  What do I do? My dad did this once.
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.140]  I remember it was a whole thing.
[05:45.380 --> 05:47.560]  And I'm like, oh my god, I didn't know what to do.
[05:47.620 --> 05:49.840]  And I thought, well, you're like three miles away from the place.
[05:49.880 --> 05:50.600]  You just keep driving.
[05:50.680 --> 05:52.080]  And I thought, no, no, no, I gotta go back.
[05:52.120 --> 06:01.160]  And I went back and all I'll say is I drove back by the gas station and there was somebody else getting gas at that pump.
[06:01.220 --> 06:02.820]  And I thought, okay.
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.160]  And so I just went home.
[06:05.560 --> 06:07.580]  I guess I didn't do any damage.
[06:07.820 --> 06:09.300]  Nothing popped off or broke.
[06:09.300 --> 06:12.080]  And I guess I'd already paid because I put my credit card in and everything.
[06:12.180 --> 06:13.000]  I just didn't get the receipt.
[06:13.680 --> 06:22.320]  But yeah, I think I drove off and I guess the gas nozzle must have just flown out when I drove away.
[06:22.560 --> 06:25.100]  I might need a presidential pardon.
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.200]  That's shit.
[06:27.480 --> 06:28.340]  Episode one.
[06:28.580 --> 06:30.080]  Now here's what I'll say.
[06:30.220 --> 06:35.100]  I don't know how many of these I'm willing to give out in a year because I think you guys are going to run roughshod.
[06:35.740 --> 06:36.960]  Do we get one per year?
[06:36.960 --> 06:38.900]  Oh, I think it's definitely one per year.
[06:39.100 --> 06:39.540]  Definitely.
[06:40.440 --> 06:44.900]  And we're halfway through, so really you're getting plenty of time.
[06:45.340 --> 06:46.200]  Go for it, Andrew.
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.460]  As you can see, this is the post.
[06:48.740 --> 06:51.420]  It's called Regulation Pod on YouTube.
[06:51.540 --> 06:53.640]  Currently has 3.5 subscribers.
[06:54.240 --> 06:55.140]  Or 1000 subscribers.
[06:55.360 --> 06:57.860]  Which is pretty good considering we haven't promoted this in any way.
[06:59.160 --> 07:02.220]  And I looked at that and ratty boy is the image of it.
[07:02.640 --> 07:04.120]  And I went, oh, that's funny.
[07:04.440 --> 07:05.420]  That's a funny thing I did.
[07:05.420 --> 07:06.360]  I don't remember doing that.
[07:06.760 --> 07:09.960]  I don't remember doing that because that's not the YouTube I made.
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.800]  I don't think that's any of our YouTube.
[07:12.300 --> 07:14.060]  I think that's a fan account.
[07:14.260 --> 07:14.820]  Yeah.
[07:15.720 --> 07:18.220]  The YouTube that I made for us
[07:18.220 --> 07:20.140]  has 3 subscribers
[07:20.140 --> 07:20.960]  currently.
[07:21.800 --> 07:23.860]  And I can't even find it
[07:23.860 --> 07:25.180]  when I manually search.
[07:25.340 --> 07:26.980]  Because I was trying to take a screenshot.
[07:27.440 --> 07:28.860]  What are you talking about?
[07:29.180 --> 07:31.620]  I made the Regulation Podcast
[07:31.620 --> 07:32.340]  YouTube.
[07:32.820 --> 07:35.060]  So I think I may have at one point
[07:35.060 --> 07:36.620]  been like, ah, yeah, you found it.
[07:36.960 --> 07:38.940]  Or like acknowledged this in some
[07:38.940 --> 07:39.420]  capacity.
[07:39.640 --> 07:43.100]  No, no, that's absolutely on you. There's no...
[07:43.100 --> 07:44.380]  No, it is on me.
[07:44.760 --> 07:46.800]  But so is the crime that people
[07:46.800 --> 07:48.260]  typically get pardoned for.
[07:48.580 --> 07:48.820]  No.
[07:50.000 --> 07:51.400]  I'm asking for an exception here.
[07:52.260 --> 07:52.740]  Wow.
[07:54.400 --> 07:55.860]  First pardon denied.
[07:56.880 --> 07:57.660]  Here's why.
[07:58.300 --> 07:59.580]  I would have given it to you too.
[07:59.580 --> 08:01.020]  That's cool. Not president.
[08:01.180 --> 08:02.220]  So here's why.
[08:04.620 --> 08:06.140]  I have a
[08:06.140 --> 08:07.960]  real issue with the
[08:07.960 --> 08:09.080]  way that
[08:09.860 --> 08:12.080]  we have no consistent branding
[08:12.080 --> 08:14.180]  over any of our names.
[08:15.040 --> 08:15.880]  We have
[08:15.880 --> 08:17.620]  picked and chosen the
[08:17.620 --> 08:19.640]  Regulation Pod, the
[08:19.640 --> 08:20.840]  Regulation Podcast,
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.880]  Regulation Pod, Regulation Podcast.
[08:24.180 --> 08:25.960]  We're all over the place with this stuff.
[08:26.200 --> 08:28.360]  And I put that squarely, Andrew, at your feet.
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.180]  So what are we?
[08:30.500 --> 08:32.020]  Yeah, go ahead, Andrew. What are we?
[08:33.300 --> 08:34.880]  Well, we're the Regulation Podcast
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.540]  because that's what you want.
[08:37.320 --> 08:38.840]  That was your big...
[08:38.840 --> 08:39.820]  I assume it would be the.
[08:40.580 --> 08:41.660]  I'm sorry, there's no the.
[08:42.660 --> 08:43.860]  We're a Regulation Podcast.
[08:44.680 --> 08:46.540]  Yeah, we're a Regulation Podcast. That's what I said.
[08:46.900 --> 08:47.240]  We're a Regulation Podcast.
[08:48.200 --> 08:49.520]  What is happening?
[08:49.940 --> 08:52.580]  This is going back to an argument we had when I said
[08:52.580 --> 08:54.860]  when I intro the first episode
[08:54.860 --> 08:56.980]  do I say welcome to a Regulation Podcast
[08:56.980 --> 08:58.300]  welcome to Regulation Podcast
[08:58.300 --> 09:00.200]  or welcome to the Regulation Podcast.
[09:00.480 --> 09:02.940]  And I do remember Eric saying
[09:02.940 --> 09:04.360]  what are you talking about?
[09:04.460 --> 09:06.200]  You just say welcome to the Regulation Podcast.
[09:06.820 --> 09:08.000]  Yeah, and you don't need...
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.900]  and the other part of what I said is that
[09:10.900 --> 09:12.400]  you don't need the in the name.
[09:12.740 --> 09:14.180]  Andrew, where can you find us on Twitter?
[09:15.900 --> 09:16.380]  On Twitter?
[09:16.520 --> 09:18.100]  We're Regulation Pod on Twitter.
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.440]  And where can you find us on Instagram?
[09:22.140 --> 09:23.360]  The Regulation Pod.
[09:25.700 --> 09:26.580]  This sucks.
[09:27.540 --> 09:28.600]  Right, exactly.
[09:29.520 --> 09:30.500]  I can't fucking...
[09:30.500 --> 09:32.080]  The last two months has been very difficult
[09:32.080 --> 09:34.100]  and I really appreciate all of
[09:34.100 --> 09:35.280]  all of your hard work
[09:35.860 --> 09:37.500]  getting us across the finish line.
[09:37.980 --> 09:39.760]  And to the new start line
[09:39.760 --> 09:42.240]  so we can do this all over again.
[09:42.420 --> 09:44.240]  I'm so excited. I feel like I have
[09:44.240 --> 09:45.680]  just so much energy for this.
[09:45.780 --> 09:47.400]  I can't wait to expend it.
[09:47.700 --> 09:48.200]  Hell yeah.
[09:48.480 --> 09:50.280]  I can't wait to watch you expend it.
[09:50.280 --> 09:52.320]  Well, I hope you expend it
[09:52.320 --> 09:54.420]  every year. All over everything.
[09:54.740 --> 09:56.120]  I want to see you expend
[09:56.120 --> 09:58.440]  so fucking hard over the
[09:58.440 --> 10:00.440]  next four years that Andrew
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.360]  is going to slip and slide in it like it's his
[10:02.360 --> 10:02.720]  bathtub.
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.380]  Gavin, have you ever spent a thousand dollars
[10:06.380 --> 10:07.260]  to expend it before?
[10:08.940 --> 10:10.200]  I like that
[10:10.200 --> 10:11.960]  Eric typically types in the Discord
[10:11.960 --> 10:14.300]  as you're doing the intro the episode number
[10:14.300 --> 10:16.100]  because it's historically been
[10:16.660 --> 10:17.520]  192 or whatever.
[10:17.520 --> 10:19.160]  He wrote episode 2.
[10:19.320 --> 10:20.840]  I feel like we could have figured that out.
[10:21.120 --> 10:23.580]  I agree, but I
[10:23.580 --> 10:25.440]  figure we have a good thing
[10:25.440 --> 10:27.520]  going and I feel good about letting you
[10:27.520 --> 10:29.400]  know through this chat. We'll keep it consistent.
[10:30.020 --> 10:31.480]  If Nick is right, why
[10:31.480 --> 10:33.440]  risk it? Technically speaking, you're Eric's
[10:33.440 --> 10:34.500]  boss at the moment, Gavin.
[10:35.600 --> 10:37.200]  We're in a transitional phase.
[10:38.580 --> 10:41.360]  Oh, I like this. Eric, when do you want your
[10:41.360 --> 10:41.900]  review to be?
[10:43.420 --> 10:44.980]  I would say this time next year.
[10:45.540 --> 10:47.000]  Okay, let me write that down.
[10:47.960 --> 10:48.700]  Before we
[10:48.700 --> 10:51.020]  move on, I need to just take the show
[10:51.020 --> 10:53.140]  hostage for a minute because I keep putting something
[10:53.140 --> 10:55.200]  off. I keep delaying this.
[10:55.920 --> 10:56.980]  I'm still using my
[10:56.980 --> 10:59.180]  old chair because I keep waiting to do a thing
[10:59.180 --> 11:01.000]  where I sit in the chair for the first time
[11:01.000 --> 11:02.280]  and it never comes.
[11:03.500 --> 11:04.420]  I've been waiting.
[11:04.960 --> 11:06.440]  You could have done it last week.
[11:06.900 --> 11:09.000]  I know, but it never came up. I never found
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.200]  a way to interject it. It doesn't matter.
[11:11.280 --> 11:12.200]  Just let him do the chair thing.
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.960]  So do you want to do it right now?
[11:14.240 --> 11:16.240]  I'm standing up. I'm about
[11:16.240 --> 11:18.180]  to sit in my new Herman Miller.
[11:18.640 --> 11:19.820]  I've been waiting months.
[11:20.280 --> 11:22.200]  It doesn't make sense to do it like four minutes in.
[11:22.260 --> 11:24.040]  Why wouldn't you wait until the end of the episode
[11:24.040 --> 11:26.220]  to be like a big grand finale? Because I want to sit
[11:26.220 --> 11:28.220]  in the chair. I'm so sick of this.
[11:28.940 --> 11:30.100]  It's just weird
[11:30.100 --> 11:32.160]  to do it mid-episode, dude. What if you start
[11:32.160 --> 11:34.000]  the next episode in the new chair?
[11:34.380 --> 11:36.120]  Oh, we can
[11:36.120 --> 11:37.180]  compare the performances.
[11:37.280 --> 11:40.160]  I definitely agree with that. I agree with that also.
[11:40.160 --> 11:41.480]  Well, hang on.
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.400]  Now, we are all co-owners
[11:44.400 --> 11:46.160]  of this company, and I think we can take a vote.
[11:46.500 --> 11:48.240]  Oh! I vote for next
[11:48.240 --> 11:50.340]  episode. I also vote for next episode.
[11:51.260 --> 11:52.280]  I vote for this
[11:52.280 --> 11:53.980]  episode. Oh, I'm sorry.
[11:54.320 --> 11:56.060]  Unfortunately, Andrew and Gavin,
[11:56.200 --> 11:58.380]  you are out-voted. Andrew, I did what I could.
[11:59.000 --> 11:59.620]  Majority rules.
[12:00.960 --> 12:02.160]  That's such a lie.
[12:02.440 --> 12:03.600]  What do you mean, no I didn't?
[12:04.700 --> 12:06.300]  You put this in motion.
[12:07.400 --> 12:08.640]  You kicked the ball.
[12:08.640 --> 12:10.480]  You know, I think technically, was that
[12:10.480 --> 12:12.800]  given to you under the previous podcast, that chair?
[12:13.460 --> 12:14.680]  Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was.
[12:14.760 --> 12:16.980]  I think technically, currently, that's my chair.
[12:17.100 --> 12:18.740]  I believe Gavin owns that
[12:18.740 --> 12:20.500]  chair. Yeah, that's pretty...
[12:20.500 --> 12:22.200]  I believe Gavin bought your chair.
[12:22.480 --> 12:24.440]  So if you could just pop that to the side for now,
[12:24.580 --> 12:25.320]  I'd really appreciate it.
[12:26.220 --> 12:27.280]  God damn it.
[12:30.300 --> 12:32.540]  Give me a second to put this chair away.
[12:32.900 --> 12:34.560]  I was really excited to sit in it.
[12:34.820 --> 12:36.700]  Keep it close. Next episode's right around
[12:36.700 --> 12:38.300]  the corner. Do you remember
[12:38.300 --> 12:40.660]  the most, or like the
[12:40.660 --> 12:42.900]  hardest you've ever laughed in your entire life?
[12:43.420 --> 12:44.640]  Like the only thing that comes
[12:44.640 --> 12:46.560]  to mind is actually
[12:47.020 --> 12:48.420]  it's a Gavin moment, but
[12:48.420 --> 12:50.660]  the night that Gavin and I, and it's the night
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.700]  it is the night that Gavin tried to fuck me, but that's not what this
[12:52.700 --> 12:54.740]  is about. Come on. It's the night that
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.740]  that's what you said that night, when I
[12:56.740 --> 12:57.020]  said no.
[12:58.640 --> 13:00.660]  It's the night we watched, for some
[13:00.660 --> 13:02.620]  reason, we watched Tommy Boy together, and
[13:02.620 --> 13:04.700]  that night, it was like the 20th
[13:04.700 --> 13:06.660]  time I'd seen it, but I don't think I've ever laughed as
[13:06.660 --> 13:08.880]  hard as watching Tommy Boy with you that night.
[13:09.420 --> 13:10.600]  Something about just the right night
[13:10.600 --> 13:12.300]  and the right mood.
[13:13.140 --> 13:14.580]  It was like a party was happening behind us.
[13:14.920 --> 13:16.200]  It was the kind of laughter where like
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.420]  Geoff's lent back on the couch
[13:18.420 --> 13:20.740]  and his legs are kicking it like 50
[13:20.740 --> 13:22.580]  miles an hour, and the whole couch is like
[13:22.580 --> 13:22.880]  grr.
[13:24.980 --> 13:26.460]  Have you ever thought about
[13:26.460 --> 13:28.520]  becoming friends with a guy called
[13:29.480 --> 13:30.840]  Tony, and a guy called
[13:30.840 --> 13:32.940]  Oscar, and
[13:33.660 --> 13:34.940]  maybe like an Emily,
[13:35.100 --> 13:36.760]  and trying to get like a friendship
[13:36.760 --> 13:37.200]  ego.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.960]  I know a Tony, and
[13:40.960 --> 13:42.880]  Oscar, and an Emily. I'm married to an Emily.
[13:43.220 --> 13:44.860]  I think finding someone called Grammy
[13:44.860 --> 13:46.120]  might be a bit difficult.
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.700]  What about a Gavin?
[13:49.180 --> 13:49.660]  Oh!
[13:50.580 --> 13:52.920]  What do you mean? Emily, Gavin?
[13:54.140 --> 13:55.040]  You're a G.
[13:55.600 --> 13:55.960]  You're a G.
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.820]  I mean, do you guys not
[13:58.820 --> 14:00.060]  understand what Gavin's saying?
[14:00.060 --> 14:02.140]  Oh, Emmy,
[14:02.840 --> 14:04.200]  Emmy, and Emily.
[14:04.900 --> 14:05.840]  I see. Gavin,
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  I just want to say that you made perfect sense.
[14:08.680 --> 14:10.060]  You made perfect sense through
[14:10.060 --> 14:11.460]  the whole way. I'm just letting you know.
[14:11.760 --> 14:14.220]  Yeah, you made perfect sense, and only one person
[14:14.220 --> 14:15.220]  got it, and the rest of us didn't.
[14:15.320 --> 14:17.580]  Yeah, and explained it to us. Oh, shit.
[14:18.320 --> 14:18.940]  You and me, Eric.
[14:19.780 --> 14:22.160]  That's on them. I don't know why they're pointing fingers.
[14:22.340 --> 14:23.920]  It made sense when you said
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.220]  Tony and Oscar.
[14:25.820 --> 14:27.920]  Like, it all made sense, 100%.
[14:27.920 --> 14:29.420]  I've decided
[14:29.780 --> 14:32.040]  there's a new type of guy that I want to become.
[14:33.120 --> 14:35.720]  I want to become a gravy
[14:35.720 --> 14:36.740]  and a can guy.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.900]  What is gravy and a can?
[14:39.060 --> 14:41.980]  What? Caramelized onion
[14:41.980 --> 14:43.760]  gravy? I want to get into gravy, but
[14:43.760 --> 14:44.660]  from cans.
[14:45.420 --> 14:47.820]  Okay, so Nick, we'll get some mash and some
[14:47.820 --> 14:49.620]  sausages. We'll cook them up,
[14:49.740 --> 14:51.060]  pour half a can each.
[14:51.660 --> 14:52.700]  Or do you want a full can each?
[14:54.460 --> 14:55.360]  That's a full can.
[14:56.340 --> 14:57.300]  That's gonna be a lot of gravy.
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.580]  Fucking, I mean, had an out
[15:01.580 --> 15:03.380]  and just went full can.
[15:03.440 --> 15:04.440]  I love it. Why not?
[15:04.920 --> 15:06.240]  Should we do this? Should we all do it?
[15:07.020 --> 15:07.340]  No.
[15:09.180 --> 15:11.400]  So, Eric, you're saying that if we all got together
[15:11.400 --> 15:13.560]  and Nick and I did the gravy from a can,
[15:13.640 --> 15:14.500]  you would just say no thanks?
[15:14.580 --> 15:16.200]  I mean, I would be excited to watch it.
[15:16.300 --> 15:19.080]  Yeah, I mean, we'd cheer you on, but this definitely
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.000]  feels like a Gavin and Nick specific
[15:21.420 --> 15:23.240]  thing. Yeah, the two
[15:23.240 --> 15:25.200]  British guys. To be honest with you,
[15:25.380 --> 15:27.180]  if Eric and I
[15:27.180 --> 15:29.000]  participated, I think it would lessen the
[15:29.700 --> 15:31.160]  whole thing. I disagree.
[15:31.360 --> 15:33.300]  I'm gonna vote on it. Should Eric drink
[15:33.300 --> 15:34.720]  the can of gravy? I vote yes.
[15:34.860 --> 15:35.940]  I vote yes.
[15:37.900 --> 15:39.080]  Andrew, it was a solid
[15:39.080 --> 15:40.460]  no when it was him.
[15:41.920 --> 15:43.220]  Should Eric drink the
[15:43.220 --> 15:44.720]  gravy? I guess I'm a yes as well.
[15:46.140 --> 15:47.560]  I love democracy.
[15:47.560 --> 15:48.240]  I love democracy.
[15:51.480 --> 15:53.380]  It's too bad our country doesn't.
[15:56.140 --> 15:57.260]  Let's do it again.
[15:58.060 --> 15:59.340]  It's like this weird
[15:59.340 --> 16:01.680]  strong-arm democracy where no one
[16:01.680 --> 16:02.980]  actually has a say in it.
[16:03.140 --> 16:05.600]  It's just bullying. It's great.
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.800]  It's so funny.
[16:07.120 --> 16:09.000]  I think we've completely misunderstood the concept.
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
[16:11.340 --> 16:12.560]  Oh my god. Wow.
[16:12.860 --> 16:15.280]  Remember a while back, I don't think it made it into an
[16:15.280 --> 16:17.140]  episode. Maybe it did, but I showed you guys
[16:17.140 --> 16:19.460]  a bunch of weird-ass
[16:20.520 --> 16:21.360]  sodas that I found
[16:21.360 --> 16:22.320]  at the Fiesta Mall.
[16:23.520 --> 16:25.160]  I want to buy a bunch of those
[16:25.160 --> 16:27.120]  and do some sort of a blind taste test to see if you can
[16:27.120 --> 16:28.540]  figure out what the fuck any of it is.
[16:28.740 --> 16:31.280]  Maybe we can combine them.
[16:31.820 --> 16:33.560]  So are you
[16:33.560 --> 16:34.740]  gonna drink the gravy also?
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.680]  Who? You.
[16:37.220 --> 16:38.440]  Well, I wasn't voted on, so no.
[16:39.500 --> 16:39.820]  Okay.
[16:41.100 --> 16:43.340]  But you want to do the blind taste test.
[16:43.340 --> 16:44.900]  With the sodas, not with the gravy.
[16:45.640 --> 16:46.920]  They kinda go hand-in-hand.
[16:47.700 --> 16:49.580]  They kinda really go hand-in-hand.
[16:49.760 --> 16:50.720]  Should we have a vote?
[16:51.020 --> 16:53.400]  If you want to vote for it, then we can vote for it.
[16:53.620 --> 16:55.420]  But until we vote for it, I don't know how to do it.
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.700]  Should Geoff drink the gravy?
[16:56.880 --> 16:57.460]  I vote no.
[16:58.320 --> 16:58.480]  Yeah.
[17:00.720 --> 17:02.200]  So how many flavors are there?
[17:02.600 --> 17:04.200]  I mean, I just don't know why you said anything.
[17:04.900 --> 17:06.000]  There are three flavors.
[17:06.040 --> 17:09.200]  I'm gonna ram this fucking democracy down all your throats every chance I get.
[17:09.720 --> 17:11.220]  So yeah, maybe we should all just have
[17:11.220 --> 17:13.340]  a sip, and we'll see the titles
[17:13.340 --> 17:15.340]  of each can, and we'll just have to guess which one we've got.
[17:15.640 --> 17:16.420]  I think that's great.
[17:17.500 --> 17:19.220]  Can I test out the bleep
[17:19.220 --> 17:20.060]  from, like, a pickle?
[17:21.140 --> 17:23.380]  Well, can we say to subscribe
[17:23.380 --> 17:25.500]  to us at patreon.com slash regulation podcast
[17:25.500 --> 17:27.240]  and listen to
[17:27.240 --> 17:29.100]  the podcast and check us out everywhere
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.220]  and now you can test the bleep?
[17:30.740 --> 17:33.760]  Yeah. Is that you having said it all now?
[17:34.040 --> 17:34.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[17:35.000 --> 17:37.500]  Okay. I'm gonna test the bleep.
[17:37.820 --> 17:38.740]  See if we got it back.
[17:41.640 --> 17:42.440]  F*** face.
[17:43.360 --> 17:45.200]  Hello and welcome to another episode
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.140]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[17:46.160 --> 17:49.160]  I'm sitting in the chair! I'm going down right now!
[17:49.520 --> 17:50.300]  I need to sit in the chair!
[17:50.720 --> 17:53.620]  Why? Why? You didn't do it at the end of the last episode.
[17:53.820 --> 17:54.540]  Why did you do that?
[17:54.540 --> 17:57.620]  Also, I gotta intro the fucking podcast first.
[17:57.740 --> 17:58.720]  I'm sitting in the chair. I don't care.
[17:59.200 --> 18:01.300]  You gotta- no, you can't. Let me get through
[18:01.300 --> 18:03.200]  the intro and I'll throw it to you.
[18:03.700 --> 18:05.000]  Let's do it properly.
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.840]  Let me throw it to you.
[18:07.080 --> 18:10.020]  Hello and welcome to another episode
[18:10.020 --> 18:11.720]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[18:12.240 --> 18:15.640]  This is episode 0-0-0-0-0-3.
[18:15.920 --> 18:17.680]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me, as always,
[18:17.800 --> 18:19.860]  Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey, Nick and Eric.
[18:20.020 --> 18:21.860]  Andrew, why don't you sit in that chair?
[18:22.100 --> 18:23.020]  I'm gonna sit in the chair!
[18:24.580 --> 18:25.640]  This is really nice.
[18:25.900 --> 18:27.420]  This is way better than what I was doing.
[18:27.680 --> 18:29.920]  My back has been so fucked because we've been recording
[18:30.440 --> 18:31.960]  everything today. This is our
[18:31.960 --> 18:34.360]  fourth recording, consecutively.
[18:35.080 --> 18:36.080]  My ass can't
[18:36.080 --> 18:37.620]  handle that in the other chair.
[18:37.620 --> 18:39.820]  I'm comfy. This is a great
[18:39.820 --> 18:41.800]  chair. To be honest, as soon as you sat
[18:41.800 --> 18:43.500]  down, I could hear
[18:43.500 --> 18:44.660]  your smile.
[18:44.740 --> 18:47.800]  He turned from a comedian to a
[18:47.800 --> 18:49.540]  comfy complainer, like instantly.
[18:50.400 --> 18:50.880]  Pfft.
[18:51.380 --> 18:53.560]  Dude, it's fucking shitting down rain
[18:53.560 --> 18:54.400]  outside my house right now.
[18:54.420 --> 18:57.640]  It started. Just started, yeah.
[18:57.760 --> 18:58.660]  It's begun.
[19:00.400 --> 19:01.360]  Gavin, you'll
[19:01.360 --> 19:03.260]  slop a lot of stuff up too in the grand scheme of things.
[19:03.340 --> 19:05.600]  You're not into sugary candies
[19:05.600 --> 19:06.900]  and food
[19:07.520 --> 19:08.920]  that was created in a lab.
[19:09.340 --> 19:11.660]  I remember touring Scotland and England
[19:11.660 --> 19:13.580]  with you, and you ate haggis and all kinds of
[19:13.580 --> 19:14.160]  nasty shit.
[19:14.960 --> 19:17.660]  That was mainly trying stuff. I still didn't
[19:17.660 --> 19:19.520]  eat that raw meat that you ate in
[19:19.520 --> 19:20.080]  the Netherlands.
[19:22.540 --> 19:23.600]  I lost him.
[19:24.100 --> 19:25.180]  Did Geoff lose power?
[19:25.640 --> 19:27.600]  I mean, the weather...
[19:28.220 --> 19:29.560]  Just so you guys know,
[19:29.600 --> 19:31.420]  we've been recording for the last few hours.
[19:32.020 --> 19:33.260]  If we're keeping this in.
[19:33.260 --> 19:35.320]  We've been recording for the last few hours
[19:35.320 --> 19:37.540]  and over probably the last, I'd say 45 minutes
[19:37.540 --> 19:38.100]  to an hour,
[19:39.280 --> 19:41.460]  the weather has turned insane.
[19:41.800 --> 19:43.040]  It was sunny and bright.
[19:43.120 --> 19:44.540]  I mowed my lawn this morning.
[19:44.960 --> 19:45.920]  It was nice out.
[19:47.700 --> 19:48.340]  It's so
[19:49.320 --> 19:51.120]  dark. It's almost 4.
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.460]  It is raining so
[19:53.460 --> 19:54.980]  hard, and I bet
[19:54.980 --> 19:57.440]  I don't know if Geoff just lost power,
[19:57.600 --> 19:59.140]  but I got a feeling he did.
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.780]  Do we think that Geoff
[20:00.780 --> 20:02.960]  is a UPS
[20:02.960 --> 20:03.860]  guy? Nope.
[20:05.680 --> 20:06.360]  UPS?
[20:06.900 --> 20:07.960]  Like the battery?
[20:08.680 --> 20:09.860]  Yeah, like the backup battery.
[20:10.580 --> 20:12.680]  No. Absolutely not.
[20:13.220 --> 20:14.660]  So, Andrew, the thing
[20:14.660 --> 20:17.120]  that I learned starting to work at Rooster Teeth
[20:18.420 --> 20:19.100]  was...
[20:19.100 --> 20:19.800]  Was that thunder?
[20:20.200 --> 20:21.660]  That sounded like thunder.
[20:22.360 --> 20:23.900]  I heard that through Discord.
[20:25.760 --> 20:26.860]  Everything's crackling
[20:26.860 --> 20:27.880]  when the lightning strikes.
[20:30.520 --> 20:31.120]  Jeez, man,
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.160]  that stuff's crazy.
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.520]  Alright, I'm back.
[20:33.820 --> 20:34.460]  What happened?
[20:35.040 --> 20:38.200]  No, my power didn't go out,
[20:38.240 --> 20:39.880]  just my router
[20:40.540 --> 20:41.820]  just turned off, I guess.
[20:42.100 --> 20:43.120]  It was weird.
[20:43.440 --> 20:45.860]  I must have had a surge or something.
[20:46.180 --> 20:47.200]  It just took it a second to come back on.
[20:47.260 --> 20:49.040]  So you're still recording? Yeah, I never stopped.
[20:49.780 --> 20:51.000]  Nice! I'm a
[20:52.020 --> 20:53.080]  fucking professional, dude.
[20:53.340 --> 20:54.780]  Are you a backup battery guy?
[20:56.000 --> 20:56.400]  No.
[20:56.580 --> 21:00.420]  No, but I never have been.
[21:00.540 --> 21:01.400]  I've never had a backup battery.
[21:01.760 --> 21:04.980]  If I was a backup battery guy,
[21:05.080 --> 21:06.680]  then that would just mean that I would be
[21:06.680 --> 21:08.980]  indignant and annoyed when I didn't lose my audio
[21:08.980 --> 21:09.860]  and everybody else did.
[21:10.420 --> 21:12.160]  This way, I'm a part of the group that loses the audio.
[21:16.020 --> 21:19.140]  Boy, those movies really...
[21:19.140 --> 21:20.300]  Those movies suck.
[21:20.900 --> 21:21.940]  Yeah, but if you
[21:21.940 --> 21:24.060]  lump them all in with Matrix 4,
[21:24.200 --> 21:25.560]  those two movies are a masterpiece.
[21:26.160 --> 21:27.800]  Do you remember, was it two
[21:27.800 --> 21:29.660]  or three that he pumped
[21:30.140 --> 21:31.840]  Cary and Moss' heart back to life?
[21:32.680 --> 21:34.100]  Oh yeah, he squeezes it.
[21:34.320 --> 21:34.580]  Yeah.
[21:36.140 --> 21:38.100]  Third one, I think. That was pretty cool.
[21:39.980 --> 21:41.940]  We're just talking about the Matrix.
[21:41.960 --> 21:44.300]  I stand by Matrix 4 as my favorite Matrix.
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.140]  No, you shut up. No, you don't.
[21:46.520 --> 21:47.920]  It is. It's my favorite.
[21:48.320 --> 21:49.040]  You're full of shit.
[21:49.900 --> 21:50.620]  What did you say?
[21:50.700 --> 21:51.660]  Matrix 4 is your favorite?
[21:52.200 --> 21:53.460]  It's my favorite of them all.
[21:53.540 --> 21:54.440]  I never saw it.
[21:56.420 --> 21:59.080]  Two and three was so fucking painful to get through.
[21:59.160 --> 22:00.520]  Yeah, I didn't like two or three.
[22:01.140 --> 22:02.560]  Why is four your favorite?
[22:03.080 --> 22:04.680]  I just had the most fun with it.
[22:04.760 --> 22:07.080]  I feel like I was maybe a little bit too young
[22:07.080 --> 22:09.300]  when the first Matrix came out to appreciate it
[22:09.300 --> 22:10.340]  at that time.
[22:10.840 --> 22:11.900]  You can still watch it now.
[22:12.680 --> 22:14.320]  Yeah, I've gone back and I've rewatched it.
[22:14.420 --> 22:15.560]  It just doesn't connect.
[22:15.560 --> 22:17.640]  It's cool. It's a cool movie,
[22:17.880 --> 22:19.880]  but it doesn't connect with me
[22:19.880 --> 22:21.140]  in the way that other people talk about it.
[22:21.220 --> 22:22.460]  Gavin, it's no Matrix 4.
[22:23.140 --> 22:24.320]  It is no Matrix 4.
[22:24.960 --> 22:27.420]  It has the mile-long highway that they built.
[22:27.700 --> 22:28.880]  What happens in the fourth one?
[22:29.600 --> 22:30.600]  Neil Patrick Harris.
[22:32.120 --> 22:33.160]  That's what happens.
[22:33.920 --> 22:34.460]  Some meta.
[22:34.900 --> 22:36.960]  There's their meta stuff in the other Matrix movie
[22:37.480 --> 22:39.340]  where they're talking about their own franchise
[22:39.340 --> 22:40.100]  within the movie.
[22:41.780 --> 22:42.700]  That sucks.
[22:42.700 --> 22:44.280]  That sucks.
[22:45.140 --> 22:46.940]  They're analyzing their own film series
[22:46.940 --> 22:47.900]  within the movie.
[22:47.900 --> 22:50.940]  Can I ask a serious question about the Matrix real quick?
[22:51.340 --> 22:51.380]  Yeah.
[22:52.380 --> 22:53.420]  When did Geoff go?
[22:54.420 --> 22:56.540]  Geoff's been gone. He'll be back.
[22:56.920 --> 22:58.160]  Are you kidding me?
[22:58.360 --> 22:59.940]  He had nothing to say about
[22:59.940 --> 23:01.540]  everything Andrew was just saying?
[23:01.980 --> 23:02.720]  Geoff's back.
[23:03.120 --> 23:05.560]  Do you remember in War of the Worlds
[23:05.560 --> 23:08.680]  when the noise the monsters
[23:08.680 --> 23:10.040]  would make in War of the Worlds?
[23:10.960 --> 23:11.440]  Yeah.
[23:12.060 --> 23:14.780]  I just heard that noise outside my house
[23:14.780 --> 23:16.340]  and then I lost internet for a second.
[23:16.500 --> 23:17.500]  There may be
[23:18.200 --> 23:20.500]  an alien invasion going on right now.
[23:20.720 --> 23:22.300]  Keep an eye out in the lightning strikes.
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.280]  There might be something coming down in them.
[23:24.360 --> 23:25.340]  Oh shit.
[23:27.020 --> 23:28.420]  Maybe something we should touch on
[23:28.420 --> 23:30.780]  that has warped all of our views
[23:30.780 --> 23:32.240]  I'd like to think since we did it.
[23:32.660 --> 23:33.580]  We did a movie battle.
[23:33.920 --> 23:36.000]  We did a summer movie auction thing.
[23:36.000 --> 23:36.500]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[23:37.780 --> 23:38.580]  I also
[23:38.580 --> 23:40.580]  don't remember what fucking movies I got
[23:40.580 --> 23:42.500]  apparently because I got sucked into
[23:42.500 --> 23:43.420]  thinking I had the crow.
[23:45.900 --> 23:46.560]  So we did
[23:46.560 --> 23:48.500]  a thing where we listed out all the summer releases
[23:48.500 --> 23:49.900]  and then we had an auction
[23:50.480 --> 23:52.780]  for who got what and the goal is
[23:52.780 --> 23:54.340]  to build a
[23:54.340 --> 23:56.500]  roster of movies that
[23:56.500 --> 23:58.520]  will earn the most domestically by the
[23:58.520 --> 24:00.640]  end of the summer. But what I am excited about
[24:00.640 --> 24:01.900]  in the realm of sports
[24:01.900 --> 24:04.380]  I really want to do this with you guys because I do it
[24:04.380 --> 24:05.820]  as part of my fantasy football league
[24:05.820 --> 24:08.440]  every year. I want us to get
[24:08.440 --> 24:10.180]  all in on the Scripps National Spelling Bee
[24:10.180 --> 24:11.500]  when it starts up.
[24:11.860 --> 24:14.000]  It's two weeks away. Pick a kid?
[24:14.380 --> 24:16.460]  I want us to pick a kid. I want us to
[24:16.460 --> 24:18.200]  watch it together. It gets
[24:18.200 --> 24:20.520]  intense in a way that you would not
[24:20.520 --> 24:23.140]  anticipate when you have a kid on the line.
[24:23.300 --> 24:24.400]  Can we auction the
[24:24.400 --> 24:24.720]  kids?
[24:26.460 --> 24:26.920]  No.
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.040]  I mean
[24:30.040 --> 24:32.400]  we could but probably not
[24:32.400 --> 24:33.060]  That's not a great idea.
[24:33.400 --> 24:34.000]  20.
[24:36.540 --> 24:37.140]  No?
[24:38.340 --> 24:40.280]  We're not actually purchasing the children.
[24:41.820 --> 24:42.420]  Oh
[24:43.140 --> 24:44.340]  I thought
[24:44.340 --> 24:45.780]  we were actually illegally going to
[24:46.840 --> 24:48.240]  buy them and then
[24:48.240 --> 24:48.740]  steal them.
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.380]  An auction draft
[24:52.380 --> 24:53.420]  like the summer league.
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.220]  I already feel like
[24:56.720 --> 24:58.380]  doing the spelling bee
[24:58.380 --> 25:00.260]  and doing content around it is like
[25:00.260 --> 25:02.000]  walking such a fine line.
[25:02.120 --> 25:03.840]  I feel weird about it already.
[25:04.000 --> 25:05.460]  You don't think a video before that
[25:05.460 --> 25:07.000]  called the kid auction.
[25:07.040 --> 25:09.920]  It's public. It wouldn't be anything
[25:09.920 --> 25:11.040]  that they're not already projecting.
[25:11.060 --> 25:13.500]  You're saying you don't want to illegally auction
[25:13.500 --> 25:15.300]  and traffic the kids is what you're saying?
[25:17.020 --> 25:18.320]  Do you think
[25:18.320 --> 25:20.160]  my issue with it is that it's public
[25:20.160 --> 25:20.780]  or private?
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.080]  I understand that it
[25:24.080 --> 25:26.120]  feels weird but we're not doing
[25:26.120 --> 25:27.640]  anything that they're not already doing.
[25:27.640 --> 25:28.620]  What does that mean?
[25:28.700 --> 25:29.880]  That didn't help at all.
[25:30.360 --> 25:33.500]  What are you saying?
[25:34.140 --> 25:35.380]  Because you have to
[25:36.540 --> 25:37.680]  we have to
[25:37.680 --> 25:39.040]  pick our kids right?
[25:39.160 --> 25:39.960]  We have to evaluate.
[25:40.220 --> 25:41.980]  That's the problem!
[25:44.740 --> 25:45.580]  You're saying
[25:45.580 --> 25:47.420]  the part that I have a problem with
[25:47.420 --> 25:48.080]  to start.
[25:49.280 --> 25:51.740]  This is going to be like the movie league all over again.
[25:51.860 --> 25:53.900]  You're like I don't know about this
[25:53.900 --> 25:55.740]  and then as soon as we're done
[25:55.740 --> 25:57.740]  you're going to be like that was so
[25:57.740 --> 25:59.900]  fucking fun. I can't wait for next year.
[26:00.100 --> 26:01.340]  I can't wait to do this.
[26:01.680 --> 26:02.660]  I'm all in on this.
[26:02.820 --> 26:05.400]  It's the most wholesome thing ever but
[26:05.400 --> 26:07.720]  unfortunately described in the most Andrew
[26:07.720 --> 26:08.380]  way possible.
[26:08.980 --> 26:11.740]  So if we can get the regulation kid auction on the calendar
[26:11.740 --> 26:12.420]  that would be great.
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.760]  Hello and welcome to another episode of
[26:15.760 --> 26:17.120]  The Regulation Podcast.
[26:17.440 --> 26:19.280]  My name is Geoff Ramsey. With me as always
[26:19.280 --> 26:21.440]  Andrew Panton and Gavin Free
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.880]  in that order of importance and popularity.
[26:23.880 --> 26:25.500]  This is episode four.
[26:26.280 --> 26:26.780]  Hi guys.
[26:27.360 --> 26:30.280]  I mean that's just factually
[26:30.280 --> 26:31.820]  correct. First of all.
[26:31.920 --> 26:32.720]  Sorry Gavin, go ahead.
[26:33.320 --> 26:35.120]  I heard the popularity part after I
[26:35.880 --> 26:37.920]  realized I wasn't paying attention to the order of the names.
[26:38.620 --> 26:39.920]  It was you than me.
[26:40.260 --> 26:41.680]  It was just him stating
[26:41.680 --> 26:43.900]  the guy with the huge
[26:43.900 --> 26:45.900]  slow motion YouTube channel on the
[26:45.900 --> 26:48.000]  side is bigger than
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.240]  the piss boy
[26:49.880 --> 26:51.000]  Vancouver child kicker.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.420]  Who would predict
[26:53.640 --> 26:55.040]  more popular in every
[26:55.040 --> 26:57.120]  metric. Geoff said that as a dig. It's just
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.020]  a fact. Went to the cheese
[26:59.020 --> 27:00.940]  rolling. I know that you're a big fan of the cheese
[27:00.940 --> 27:02.900]  roll. Oh, of course. Yeah, I was very
[27:02.900 --> 27:05.020]  excited to see when you shared clips of the cheese
[27:05.020 --> 27:06.960]  roll. Was that your first time
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.000]  attending the cheese rolling? Yes.
[27:09.600 --> 27:10.980]  Was it as
[27:10.980 --> 27:12.380]  awesome as it looks?
[27:13.620 --> 27:14.960]  It's something I've realized
[27:14.960 --> 27:17.020]  that just doesn't come across well on camera
[27:17.020 --> 27:18.800]  and even on my footage
[27:18.800 --> 27:20.980]  that hill is freaking steep
[27:20.980 --> 27:22.920]  like it is so
[27:22.920 --> 27:24.900]  immensely steep. I don't know how
[27:24.900 --> 27:26.760]  people don't die. Honestly,
[27:26.900 --> 27:28.780]  the cheese was my enemy that day
[27:28.780 --> 27:30.600]  because I was
[27:31.640 --> 27:32.980]  right at the bottom of the
[27:32.980 --> 27:34.460]  hill directly in the middle
[27:34.460 --> 27:36.580]  and everyone
[27:36.580 --> 27:39.040]  all the real press were hiding behind
[27:39.040 --> 27:40.880]  hay bales and we were
[27:40.880 --> 27:42.940]  just shoved off to the side
[27:42.940 --> 27:44.820]  by all the people with real equipment were like
[27:44.820 --> 27:46.540]  yeah piss off we got this spot
[27:46.540 --> 27:48.340]  so we were just shoved over and over
[27:48.340 --> 27:50.580]  and then like a bunch of people with GoPros
[27:50.580 --> 27:52.580]  and just like whoever that felt like it
[27:52.580 --> 27:54.040]  started climbing into the press area
[27:54.040 --> 27:56.640]  so I was shoved even more further over
[27:57.140 --> 27:57.580]  completely
[27:59.160 --> 28:00.420]  exposed to the cheese
[28:00.420 --> 28:01.600]  so for the first
[28:02.580 --> 28:04.560]  I would say for the first 5 seconds of
[28:04.560 --> 28:05.960]  the 10 second cheese roll
[28:06.420 --> 28:08.400]  I was just trying not to be killed
[28:08.400 --> 28:10.440]  by cheese because
[28:10.440 --> 28:12.560]  it comes cooking down
[28:12.560 --> 28:14.460]  that hill so I would just be watching
[28:14.460 --> 28:17.580]  And then after it missed me, I would start filming.
[28:18.200 --> 28:21.480]  Hey Nick, there's about seven sound drops in there.
[28:21.620 --> 28:23.960]  If you could pull those out, they're all gold.
[28:24.220 --> 28:25.500]  Oh yeah, you got it.
[28:25.700 --> 28:25.980]  Thank you.
[28:26.060 --> 28:26.440]  Oh, what happened?
[28:27.040 --> 28:28.660]  No, you just said a lot of really awesome stuff.
[28:28.780 --> 28:29.200]  Oh, shit.
[28:30.140 --> 28:32.000]  We should isolate and hold on to forever.
[28:33.300 --> 28:34.640]  One more thing about the cheese thing.
[28:34.820 --> 28:37.360]  What was the craziest thing that you saw at the cheese thing?
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.640]  Um, well, a lot of drunk people.
[28:40.880 --> 28:43.300]  Yeah, I assume. I feel like that goes with it.
[28:43.300 --> 28:47.320]  I just saw so many necks get real bent up.
[28:50.260 --> 28:52.220]  One guy was great too.
[28:52.280 --> 28:55.040]  His face plotted so hard, both of his shoes flew off.
[28:55.780 --> 28:59.320]  Did you see like scorpion after scorpion?
[28:59.480 --> 29:03.980]  Oh yeah, some of the most awkward looking scorpions I've ever seen in my life.
[29:04.300 --> 29:06.520]  Like scorpions on the move while twisting.
[29:07.420 --> 29:11.940]  Did you see the comment leaver that posted this picture?
[29:13.900 --> 29:14.540]  Yeah.
[29:14.660 --> 29:15.080]  Oh yeah.
[29:23.340 --> 29:24.620]  It is...
[29:24.620 --> 29:26.240]  An Achievement Hunter logo.
[29:26.420 --> 29:27.240]  That should be on a K-Wing channel, right?
[29:28.140 --> 29:31.320]  Yeah, well not, let me actually rephrase that.
[29:31.420 --> 29:32.660]  It is not an Achievement Hunter logo.
[29:32.980 --> 29:38.420]  It is a green, uh, circular f*** face symbol logo.
[29:39.040 --> 29:39.500]  With a...
[29:39.500 --> 29:40.600]  Regulation podcast logo.
[29:41.940 --> 29:43.820]  Which happens to be the f*** face.
[29:44.640 --> 29:46.500]  Oh yeah, we changed her name.
[29:46.800 --> 29:47.080]  Sorry.
[29:48.000 --> 29:48.820]  Oh my god.
[29:49.220 --> 29:51.640]  The lineage in that image is hilarious.
[29:52.440 --> 29:55.520]  I think that needs to be more like sequel things like that.
[29:56.000 --> 29:56.200]  Yeah.
[29:56.740 --> 30:01.580]  If the background was red on one side and blue on the other instead of all black,
[30:01.800 --> 30:03.520]  we just have your whole situation.
[30:06.440 --> 30:09.300]  Like there's my entire adult life in 300 pixels.
[30:10.600 --> 30:11.380]  Oh my god.
[30:11.600 --> 30:15.800]  Subscribe to both channels and check them both out because we're updating frequently.
[30:16.200 --> 30:17.600]  And then there's even more stuff on the Patreon.
[30:17.860 --> 30:23.400]  So it's very exciting and I'm very excited to continue to do this stuff with you guys.
[30:23.860 --> 30:24.240]  Hell yeah.
[30:25.120 --> 30:27.180]  You think Precum is kind of a lazy name?
[30:27.820 --> 30:28.480]  Say it again.
[30:29.080 --> 30:29.280]  What?
[30:29.960 --> 30:31.900]  Is what a lazy name? Did you say Precum?
[30:32.180 --> 30:32.580]  Precum.
[30:32.600 --> 30:33.560]  He said Precum.
[30:34.880 --> 30:37.320]  As like a closer, but I'm not done talking.
[30:37.400 --> 30:38.700]  What's lazy about it?
[30:38.700 --> 30:40.700]  It just doesn't have its own name. Precum?
[30:41.180 --> 30:43.420]  It's just pre. It's adding pre to a thing.
[30:44.120 --> 30:48.780]  It'd be like if you ordered orange juice, but your empty glass was just called pre-juice.
[30:52.820 --> 30:55.520]  You could just technically apply it to everything.
[30:56.600 --> 30:59.020]  Like if tortillas were pre-burrito.
[31:00.320 --> 31:07.880]  I think technically it would be like if somebody gave you a glass and then walked by and put the tiniest squeeze from an orange in it and said,
[31:07.880 --> 31:09.260]  I'll be back later with the rest.
[31:11.600 --> 31:14.760]  Is the regulation podcast just longer than the other one?
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.180]  I don't think so.
[31:16.300 --> 31:16.860]  Not at all.
[31:17.060 --> 31:17.120]  No.
[31:17.120 --> 31:18.120]  We just had to catch up.
[31:18.240 --> 31:18.980]  It's not.
[31:19.740 --> 31:23.840]  I learned something. Can I extend? I'm learning all sorts of things.
[31:24.920 --> 31:30.900]  I learned that opera music, they're actually saying stuff and that blew my mind.
[31:31.420 --> 31:33.520]  I had no idea.
[31:33.720 --> 31:34.660]  Yes, you did.
[31:35.040 --> 31:35.740]  No, I didn't.
[31:35.740 --> 31:37.620]  Did you think it was fucking sounds?
[31:37.840 --> 31:45.920]  I thought that it was a visual storytelling medium, and then they were just making emotional noises.
[31:46.660 --> 31:48.920]  I've never really thought about opera that much.
[31:48.920 --> 31:50.420]  Everyone mimicked exactly?
[31:51.300 --> 31:57.680]  Listen, I didn't pursue opera, so I don't have a large breadth of knowledge when it comes to it.
[31:57.960 --> 32:03.180]  I think my biggest exposure to it was Hitman, Blood Money, there's an opera level.
[32:03.180 --> 32:07.400]  But whenever you hear opera in a thing, they're just always going like...
[32:09.480 --> 32:12.080]  And I just thought that those were noises.
[32:12.480 --> 32:16.500]  I didn't know that you could translate that.
[32:16.760 --> 32:18.440]  It's just a foreign language, dude.
[32:18.700 --> 32:19.660]  It's crazy.
[32:20.520 --> 32:21.780]  Yeah, man, they sound like this.
[32:26.740 --> 32:29.120]  In Italy, they were just like...
[32:30.100 --> 32:32.740]  Well, I've never seen an English opera.
[32:33.180 --> 32:35.440]  Why is it always just Italian people?
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.400]  I think they invented it, and that's where it's most popular.
[32:42.660 --> 32:45.160]  Can I just say thank you, Andrew?
[32:45.640 --> 32:46.460]  That's opera.
[32:47.120 --> 32:47.800]  Thank you, man.
[32:50.360 --> 32:54.420]  I don't think you could be closer to racism without going all the way in.
[32:54.420 --> 32:57.860]  No, I just thought it was... I didn't know, because it's so loud.
[32:58.560 --> 33:01.420]  I wasn't going to say anything, but you're totally right, Gavin.
[33:01.420 --> 33:03.720]  No, not at all.
[33:05.580 --> 33:08.620]  Anyway, I'm not stereotyping that, I just didn't know.
[33:08.820 --> 33:10.920]  You just keep doing an impression.
[33:12.840 --> 33:14.360]  It's not helping your case.
[33:14.460 --> 33:15.800]  Does it not sound like opera?
[33:16.600 --> 33:22.420]  It sounds like...
[33:23.180 --> 33:26.140]  sort of like five rows back from me at a football game.
[33:31.980 --> 33:34.780]  Is this what it sounds like to hang out with your grandpa, Gavin?
[33:35.840 --> 33:37.660]  It's like being back at home.
[33:39.840 --> 33:42.760]  This is the deleted scenes of that Skype commercial.
[33:43.420 --> 33:45.380]  You know what might happen this month or next month?
[33:46.000 --> 33:46.400]  What?
[33:46.740 --> 33:47.600]  It might be coming home.
[33:52.220 --> 33:55.580]  Here's the thing, I want to ask you to do a stream of that again,
[33:55.700 --> 33:59.340]  but also I want you to be able to enjoy the thing that you want to enjoy
[33:59.340 --> 34:01.620]  and not have to monetize everything that we do.
[34:01.860 --> 34:03.160]  We could all watch it together.
[34:03.520 --> 34:06.200]  I would love to watch that with you.
[34:06.340 --> 34:07.360]  When is it?
[34:07.980 --> 34:10.140]  I think the final is going to be in July.
[34:10.820 --> 34:12.060]  That's a bad month for me.
[34:12.980 --> 34:13.660]  What does that mean?
[34:15.760 --> 34:16.780]  I'll get him to move it.
[34:17.080 --> 34:19.380]  When I was in England just now, I promised...
[34:20.760 --> 34:24.060]  I promised my family if England won the Euros, I'd move back to England.
[34:26.300 --> 34:27.100]  You're insane.
[34:27.580 --> 34:29.000]  What are you doing?
[34:31.300 --> 34:36.560]  Is there a statute of limitations on that?
[34:36.680 --> 34:37.460]  When do you have to do that?
[34:38.580 --> 34:40.660]  You can do it 50 years from now, right?
[34:40.780 --> 34:42.320]  And you're still fulfilling the obligation?
[34:42.600 --> 34:44.160]  I wasn't specific on timeline, I guess.
[34:44.560 --> 34:45.520]  Yeah, that's fine.
[34:46.020 --> 34:47.680]  I feel like that changes nothing.
[34:48.300 --> 34:49.280]  I did shake on it.
[34:49.680 --> 34:51.580]  I want to know what you put it in the Slack.
[34:51.700 --> 34:52.900]  I want to know what you did again.
[34:52.900 --> 34:55.800]  You put it in the Slack, you teed it up.
[34:55.800 --> 34:57.480]  Because here are things that have happened before.
[34:57.900 --> 34:59.180]  You've shit yourself.
[34:59.460 --> 35:02.960]  I don't think you'd be embarrassed about sharing this.
[35:02.960 --> 35:04.040]  You've broken a tooth.
[35:05.240 --> 35:07.260]  Here, I'm going to put a video up that Emily took.
[35:07.340 --> 35:08.040]  This is yesterday.
[35:08.580 --> 35:10.360]  Oh no.
[35:13.400 --> 35:16.040]  You've got to be kidding me.
[35:17.580 --> 35:19.080]  Dude, come on.
[35:19.160 --> 35:19.680]  How?
[35:21.560 --> 35:23.660]  Why do you keep doing this?
[35:25.340 --> 35:28.500]  So, if you've watched the video at home, you probably haven't seen the video.
[35:28.500 --> 35:30.400]  So, you're reattaching a gas hose.
[35:30.780 --> 35:31.680]  Dropping it.
[35:32.700 --> 35:33.700]  Gas Olivia.
[35:34.220 --> 35:35.540]  Oh my god.
[35:35.700 --> 35:38.440]  I got covered in gas.
[35:38.940 --> 35:40.360]  You've got to stop doing it.
[35:40.380 --> 35:42.200]  You've got to stop driving away.
[35:42.480 --> 35:44.020]  So, yesterday...
[35:45.300 --> 35:46.640]  How is this happening?
[35:46.660 --> 35:47.620]  What are you doing?
[35:49.520 --> 35:50.640]  What's your problem?
[35:53.700 --> 35:54.100]  How?
[35:57.080 --> 36:01.100]  So, yesterday, I stopped at a gas station with my wife and daughter.
[36:01.580 --> 36:05.320]  And we started filling up Emily's car.
[36:06.220 --> 36:08.460]  I'm proud to say this has never happened in my car.
[36:08.580 --> 36:09.480]  I'm always driving her car.
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.940]  We were filling up Emily's car.
[36:12.060 --> 36:13.900]  And we decided to go in for Slurpees.
[36:14.240 --> 36:16.340]  And then it just took a long time inside.
[36:16.500 --> 36:17.220]  We were getting snacks.
[36:17.380 --> 36:20.520]  And when we came all out, we all just jumped in the car and drove away.
[36:20.620 --> 36:21.660]  And then I heard a kathunk.
[36:21.660 --> 36:24.880]  And then Emily and Milly said, oh my god, no.
[36:25.160 --> 36:27.120]  And I stopped and I backed up and I looked.
[36:27.260 --> 36:30.800]  And I had driven away with the gas hose still in the car.
[36:31.300 --> 36:36.800]  And this time, I stuck around to see that I ripped it out of the gas pump.
[36:37.400 --> 36:38.320]  Oh my god.
[36:38.340 --> 36:40.760]  Shot gas all over myself.
[36:41.480 --> 36:42.880]  I tried to put it back together.
[36:43.400 --> 36:46.880]  But the pressure from all the gas coming out just shot it back out at me.
[36:47.260 --> 36:51.020]  And then I went inside and I had to stand in line while the lady looked at me.
[36:52.320 --> 36:54.740]  And she said, she didn't even say anything to me.
[36:54.820 --> 36:56.340]  I said, um, I made a mistake.
[36:56.600 --> 37:02.500]  And she just pointed to a little dude who had a bucket, like a trash can full of cat litter.
[37:02.520 --> 37:05.080]  And he just shrugged for me to follow him.
[37:05.120 --> 37:08.020]  And he just walked up and he threw some cat litter down.
[37:08.240 --> 37:11.400]  And he stuck it back in and twisted it.
[37:11.640 --> 37:13.040]  And then it reconnected.
[37:13.080 --> 37:14.480]  And he said, okay, you're good.
[37:15.140 --> 37:16.680]  And I went, this happens a lot, huh?
[37:16.800 --> 37:17.700]  And he said, no.
[37:17.700 --> 37:18.860]  And then I...
[37:22.700 --> 37:31.180]  If there was a way to convince yourself that you could sleep through like one of those instances without any consequences.
[37:31.380 --> 37:32.720]  And that it was actually all okay.
[37:32.820 --> 37:35.800]  That this isn't real, but you think it is.
[37:36.240 --> 37:37.460]  I would pay so much for that.
[37:38.120 --> 37:42.460]  Like a fake meeting type thing that I'm skipping by having this nap.
[37:43.360 --> 37:44.740]  I don't know what you just said.
[37:46.260 --> 37:47.780]  Have you ever...
[37:47.780 --> 37:51.080]  Okay, let me translate.
[37:51.660 --> 37:58.040]  Have you ever laid in bed and you see the cheese coming down the hill?
[37:59.300 --> 38:00.900]  He's doing a round of accents today.
[38:01.200 --> 38:03.760]  Does everyone else here know what Andrew just said?
[38:03.980 --> 38:04.180]  No.
[38:05.440 --> 38:06.180]  That's a no from me.
[38:06.460 --> 38:08.740]  I have no idea. I do not understand.
[38:09.240 --> 38:12.000]  Let's say it is 1pm.
[38:12.000 --> 38:20.820]  It's 1pm and you agreed previously that you were going to go do something at 2pm.
[38:21.260 --> 38:24.600]  And you're relaxed, you're laying down, you're cozy.
[38:25.600 --> 38:27.120]  And it's like, oh man, you know what?
[38:27.140 --> 38:28.980]  I made this obligation beforehand.
[38:29.680 --> 38:33.480]  But in a world in which I had no plans, a nap would be so good right now.
[38:33.820 --> 38:34.700]  This would be so great.
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.740]  I feel like the best naps are always in those instances.
[38:38.740 --> 38:42.940]  Where you can't nap because you have an obligation you need to fulfill.
[38:43.540 --> 38:45.500]  So you can't do it. So you have to go do the thing.
[38:45.740 --> 38:47.360]  Like a pre-commitment nap.
[38:47.740 --> 38:48.900]  Pre-commitment nap.
[38:49.320 --> 38:56.200]  I want a service that makes me believe that I have one of those.
[38:56.780 --> 39:01.100]  That I can sleep through, but there's no actual consequence.
[39:01.100 --> 39:03.150]  Wait, so you need to know...
[39:04.180 --> 39:09.290]  I need to feel it's real for the nap, but...
[39:10.200 --> 39:12.040]  Because I don't want to miss the meeting.
[39:12.280 --> 39:14.240]  I want to spend time with you.
[39:15.220 --> 39:16.680]  That would take priority.
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.220]  But a nap is absolutely enhanced by these situations.
[39:22.680 --> 39:25.360]  It is more appealing, at least to me.
[39:25.360 --> 39:30.940]  I don't understand what is going on for the last...
[39:30.940 --> 39:33.020]  It must be ten minutes of the show.
[39:33.140 --> 39:37.580]  You want a feeling that you know is real?
[39:37.800 --> 39:41.740]  A Schrodinger's feeling of real and fake at the same time?
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.420]  Andrew, so you can take what you think is a pretty good nap.
[39:46.940 --> 39:48.640]  It enhances the nap.
[39:49.300 --> 39:51.300]  It's like the sequel to Inception.
[39:51.980 --> 39:53.880]  It's like Icy Hotting your nap.
[39:54.440 --> 39:55.940]  Have you never been in that scenario?
[39:56.060 --> 39:59.300]  Where you're like, man, this would be such a great fucking nap right now.
[39:59.460 --> 40:01.000]  But I can't because I have an obligation.
[40:01.280 --> 40:02.440]  I've never felt that.
[40:02.660 --> 40:05.200]  No, never in my life.
[40:05.380 --> 40:09.420]  You're describing a feeling that I can't chase because I don't know that it exists.
[40:10.000 --> 40:10.540]  I got it.
[40:12.040 --> 40:15.920]  You need to go down to your local library or your local bookstore.
[40:16.300 --> 40:18.500]  And you need to join a book club.
[40:20.600 --> 40:22.700]  Oh, that's the move, Geoff.
[40:22.700 --> 40:24.760]  I should have consulted with you earlier.
[40:25.020 --> 40:29.960]  You need to join a book club that meets every Tuesday at 6pm or 8pm or whatever.
[40:30.220 --> 40:33.980]  And then you plan your naps right before that.
[40:34.280 --> 40:36.880]  I'm becoming a new kind of guy, by the way.
[40:39.180 --> 40:41.600]  I'm going to become a lawn guy.
[40:42.720 --> 40:44.140]  You're going to become a lawn guy?
[40:44.540 --> 40:46.380]  Howard, what are you doing with your lawn? I'm excited.
[40:46.900 --> 40:47.840]  I'm going to mow it.
[40:48.500 --> 40:49.880]  Okay, I'm less excited.
[40:50.400 --> 40:50.780]  What do you mean?
[40:52.560 --> 40:54.720]  Why would that be an exciting thing?
[40:55.040 --> 40:58.040]  I've been mowing my lawn for 49 years.
[40:58.040 --> 41:01.380]  Yeah, it's like, yeah, hey dude, it sucks. It fucking sucks to mow your lawn.
[41:01.920 --> 41:06.700]  Really? I just suddenly was looking at my lawn and I thought, I want to mow that. I want to buy a lawn mower and mow it.
[41:06.760 --> 41:09.360]  Do you want to come over and mow my lawn? You can mow my lawn.
[41:09.800 --> 41:11.000]  God, no. I want to mow my lawn.
[41:11.360 --> 41:15.560]  I immediately fired the guy who's been mowing it for the last nine years.
[41:16.020 --> 41:16.340]  What?
[41:16.520 --> 41:18.200]  And I ordered a mower. Just on a whim.
[41:18.720 --> 41:19.460]  Wait, what?
[41:19.460 --> 41:19.620]  What?
[41:20.120 --> 41:21.940]  I could have given you a lawn mower.
[41:22.580 --> 41:23.180]  Oh, really?
[41:23.180 --> 41:25.240]  Because I just sold my house. I don't need mine.
[41:25.920 --> 41:26.300]  Oh.
[41:27.120 --> 41:28.480]  I gave it to the movers.
[41:29.400 --> 41:30.560]  Have you done it yet?
[41:30.960 --> 41:31.320]  No.
[41:32.040 --> 41:32.540]  It's fine.
[41:33.160 --> 41:34.920]  Are you sure that you're a lawn guy?
[41:35.800 --> 41:37.640]  Well, I don't... I'm going to become one.
[41:38.360 --> 41:39.920]  Wait, have I jumped into this too soon?
[41:39.920 --> 41:41.020]  No, you're fine.
[41:41.020 --> 41:46.820]  Yeah, think about this, Eric. He finds manual labor charming.
[41:47.280 --> 41:50.080]  And he loves the sun. And he loves to be out in the sun.
[41:50.260 --> 41:51.740]  So it's like the perfect activity.
[41:52.440 --> 41:57.240]  I love power washing and painting walls.
[41:57.560 --> 41:59.700]  I love finishing the square.
[42:00.200 --> 42:02.260]  I understand. I mean, I get that.
[42:02.480 --> 42:07.100]  I don't mind mowing my... The act of mowing my lawn is fine.
[42:07.500 --> 42:09.940]  It's not the act that is the bothersome thing.
[42:09.940 --> 42:14.160]  It is the... Alright, well, it's Friday and I have some time.
[42:14.460 --> 42:16.000]  Is this what I'm doing with my time?
[42:16.160 --> 42:17.380]  I'll put it off for a day.
[42:17.540 --> 42:20.220]  Uh-oh, it's Saturday. I gotta do this thing.
[42:20.520 --> 42:22.080]  Oh, shit, I put it off for another day.
[42:22.240 --> 42:25.340]  Uh-oh, it's Sunday. It's only getting longer.
[42:25.700 --> 42:27.180]  And this is forever.
[42:27.660 --> 42:29.280]  I don't think I would procrastinate that.
[42:29.380 --> 42:30.950]  I think I would use that as my procrastination.
[42:32.740 --> 42:33.160]  Really?
[42:33.600 --> 42:33.980]  Yeah.
[42:34.040 --> 42:38.220]  You'll learn not to procrastinate pretty fast because once it gets out of control, it's like three times the work.
[42:38.900 --> 42:40.440]  Last episode, we did opera.
[42:40.600 --> 42:42.940]  I did the opera explain my opera thing.
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.800]  And I learned after the fact that my partner was on a call in the other room.
[42:50.020 --> 42:51.720]  And somebody said on the call,
[42:52.220 --> 42:53.620]  What is that noise?
[42:53.820 --> 42:55.340]  It sounds like opera music.
[42:55.560 --> 42:57.440]  And it's the most vindicated I've ever felt.
[42:57.580 --> 42:58.540]  I felt great about it.
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.580]  They said it sounded like opera, not emotional noises?
[43:01.280 --> 43:02.840]  No, they didn't say emotional noises.
[43:02.960 --> 43:04.860]  Listen, they knew more than I did.
[43:05.280 --> 43:07.860]  I thought it was sheet music, to be more clear.
[43:07.860 --> 43:10.580]  I thought they were singing like the equivalency of notes.
[43:10.940 --> 43:13.760]  Not that there were words associated with those notes.
[43:13.900 --> 43:15.820]  What do you mean the equivalency of notes?
[43:15.980 --> 43:20.660]  Well, you know how like a guitar, when you strum a guitar, it's notes.
[43:21.200 --> 43:30.860]  If I can interject, on the subreddit, somebody has put Andrew singing over opera music.
[43:30.860 --> 43:39.180]  And the top comment is, with the music, I can't tell if that's real opera or Andrew's gibberish lol.
[43:39.960 --> 43:40.900]  Can I listen to this now?
[43:46.410 --> 43:47.890]  Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?
[43:49.490 --> 43:51.550]  Sounds like some opera right there.
[43:56.650 --> 43:58.630]  You'd pay a top dollar for that opera.
[44:03.200 --> 44:05.480]  It sounds like Back Alley Opera.
[44:06.140 --> 44:12.140]  I can imagine you reflected in a dark puddle with rats listening.
[44:12.680 --> 44:17.820]  You mean like Unsafe performed illegally without the use of anesthesia opera?
[44:20.120 --> 44:22.960]  That is shockingly good.
[44:23.480 --> 44:25.380]  I became a lawn guy.
[44:26.440 --> 44:27.900]  Yeah? How's that going?
[44:28.280 --> 44:29.080]  Yeah, it's hot.
[44:31.800 --> 44:36.080]  It sort of comes with the territory living in Austin and being a lawn guy.
[44:36.560 --> 44:41.420]  I was reading about what to wear and they were like, you gotta not wear shorts, you should wear long pants.
[44:42.520 --> 44:42.820]  Yeah.
[44:44.320 --> 44:45.120]  Pretty uncomfortable.
[44:45.780 --> 44:48.040]  And I guess you only really mow in the summer.
[44:51.120 --> 44:52.140]  I'm rethinking it.
[44:52.760 --> 44:55.000]  You might not be a lawn guy.
[44:55.540 --> 44:57.500]  Yeah, glad you fired your guy, man. This is good.
[44:57.920 --> 45:01.700]  Well, I could get a new guy or crawl back through the same guy.
[45:01.860 --> 45:07.780]  But I feel like I'm gonna stick it out throughout the summer and see if maybe I just get a tolerance for it.
[45:08.260 --> 45:09.320]  Geoff, you're left-handed, right?
[45:09.840 --> 45:10.700]  Yeah, thanks for asking.
[45:11.080 --> 45:11.600]  And married?
[45:12.540 --> 45:13.500]  Yes, thanks for asking.
[45:13.920 --> 45:16.800]  Does your wedding ring go near your butthole?
[45:19.440 --> 45:22.180]  That's such a good question. That's such a good question.
[45:22.620 --> 45:29.200]  Because I'm not a ring guy, but Meg just got this aura ring thing that tracks her sleep and stuff.
[45:29.340 --> 45:35.700]  And I was like, oh, that looks cool. And I've never worn a ring, but I was wondering, do you take off your ring to wipe?
[45:36.400 --> 45:44.880]  No, I don't, but I see what you're saying. It's definitely in the area, but I mean, with folded toilet paper, it's between you and the poop.
[45:45.700 --> 45:47.840]  He's got it all over the ring, I don't trust this at all.
[45:47.940 --> 45:49.320]  Because my knuckles are out sometimes.
[45:49.320 --> 45:56.480]  I can't think of the last time I got poop on my hands in that way.
[45:57.340 --> 46:05.360]  I did get poop all over my pants and my shirt and my shoes and two chairs today, although that was fun.
[46:06.000 --> 46:06.500]  What?
[46:06.740 --> 46:08.100]  It's gotta be more hygienic.
[46:08.160 --> 46:17.520]  Playing in the backyard with the dog and I guess at some point I stepped on poop and then somehow I sat Indian style and it got everywhere.
[46:17.520 --> 46:20.380]  I was in the lab this weekend.
[46:20.800 --> 46:21.380]  Oh, hell yeah.
[46:21.420 --> 46:23.360]  You guys know about it.
[46:24.000 --> 46:33.140]  Last episode, I booked myself into a whole bunch of different things that I had no intention on going to, to see if it would make a difference in the nap game.
[46:33.860 --> 46:35.860]  And let me tell you, it was fantastic.
[46:36.280 --> 46:38.680]  It was one of the best weekends I've ever had.
[46:39.080 --> 46:40.520]  I have a whole system for it now.
[46:40.860 --> 46:41.960]  I'm calling it meet and sleep.
[46:42.020 --> 46:43.160]  They meet, I sleep.
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.280]  We have rules for the meet and sleep system.
[46:48.360 --> 46:49.780]  I post this in.
[46:50.340 --> 46:52.800]  It's a rule one for meet and sleep.
[46:52.800 --> 46:55.660]  If you want to do this at home, no expectation of payment.
[46:55.980 --> 46:58.280]  I don't want them to lose money on my behalf.
[46:58.440 --> 47:00.980]  That would dampen my enjoyment.
[47:01.460 --> 47:02.420]  Can't have that.
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.040]  Rule two, my space doesn't block someone from attending.
[47:06.640 --> 47:10.680]  You don't want to ruin someone else's opportunity to do things they're excited about.
[47:10.840 --> 47:12.460]  We're not trying to be selfish here.
[47:13.400 --> 47:17.060]  Rule three, must have at least six people confirmed going.
[47:17.880 --> 47:19.180]  I don't want a situation.
[47:19.440 --> 47:20.100]  That seems arbitrary.
[47:20.780 --> 47:22.960]  Where, well no, six is a group.
[47:23.800 --> 47:28.280]  You don't want it to be such a size that you not being there materially changes the event.
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.360]  Yeah, like if you are 25% of the event, you not being there is very noticeable.
[47:34.900 --> 47:37.700]  I thought, by the way, last week you explained that very well.
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.960]  And I was surprised by how many people in comments I saw were confused by what was going on there.
[47:41.960 --> 47:44.700]  Did you get it the first time he explained it though?
[47:45.120 --> 47:45.560]  Yeah, I did.
[47:46.020 --> 47:47.060]  Oh, why didn't you say anything?
[47:47.920 --> 47:51.360]  I did. I think I was the first person to jump in and be like, I got you. And I tried to help.
[47:51.460 --> 47:52.820]  That's why I came up with the idea for the book club.
[47:53.140 --> 47:54.520]  I'm pretty sure you said nothing.
[47:55.560 --> 47:56.400]  Well, because I'm listening.
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.760]  So you were the first one to say something and also you didn't say anything because you were listening?
[48:03.980 --> 48:07.440]  I didn't say anything until I said something. That's how saying stuff works.
[48:08.220 --> 48:14.540]  I appreciate that he took the time to think and process because that book club idea, really, this wouldn't have happened without it.
[48:14.940 --> 48:20.380]  I know you guys haven't watched this season of Survivor, but goddamn, this is the season of people not using immunity idols.
[48:20.780 --> 48:23.360]  What do you think they're there for, dumbass?
[48:23.640 --> 48:26.420]  Anyway, it would be awesome if you could find one at the grocery store.
[48:26.980 --> 48:28.260]  Did anyone try and play the podium?
[48:29.240 --> 48:30.660]  Nobody tried to play the podium this year.
[48:30.820 --> 48:34.500]  I'd be like, I'm immune from paying for these groceries, I'm just going to walk out now.
[48:34.580 --> 48:35.460]  I'm immune from prosecution.
[48:38.000 --> 48:45.140]  I like that idea of a city saying, listen, there's one idol somewhere within the city limits. Go find it.
[48:45.460 --> 48:48.320]  And then as soon as they find it, they have to rebury it out there somewhere.
[48:49.060 --> 48:55.140]  If there was such thing as an immunity bullet, would you have fired it yet?
[48:57.180 --> 48:59.640]  Oh. What an interesting question.
[49:00.260 --> 49:04.160]  No matter what happens with the bullet, no matter what the bullet hits, you're not responsible.
[49:05.940 --> 49:08.760]  Would you, Gavin? Would you have used your bullet already?
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.520]  No, I don't think so. I think I'd still have it in the old chamber.
[49:15.120 --> 49:17.340]  God, I bet I would have used mine before I hit 20.
[49:20.100 --> 49:24.260]  How do you fucking hold on to that? Jesus Christ.
[49:24.500 --> 49:27.300]  The second I found out about it, I'd go looking for something to do with it.
[49:29.940 --> 49:31.820]  I feel like Eric could also have used his.
[49:31.820 --> 49:38.120]  I was thinking about it. It feels like the knee jerk would be, yeah, I would have used it.
[49:38.260 --> 49:43.180]  But also, I think I would be too afraid to lose it, so I would still have it.
[49:43.440 --> 49:47.320]  But it would be a thing that's constantly on me, and I would learn how to do tricks with it.
[49:47.360 --> 49:49.340]  Like, I would roll it around my knuckles and stuff.
[49:49.960 --> 49:51.060]  You'd keep it on a necklace or something?
[49:51.260 --> 49:56.240]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So at any point, on the necklace, if someone does something,
[49:56.300 --> 50:00.220]  I kind of lower my sunglasses and point the bullet at them, because then they know.
[50:00.860 --> 50:05.780]  It would be so cool if it was like a Wild West style duel, and like one bullet in the chamber,
[50:05.940 --> 50:07.380]  immunity bullet, the second one.
[50:07.780 --> 50:11.260]  So like, pa-pa, killing the guy and then firing the immunity bullet to the sky.
[50:11.360 --> 50:12.180]  Oh, it'd be awesome.
[50:12.860 --> 50:15.260]  Wouldn't you want to kill the guy with the immunity bullet, though, so you didn't get in trouble?
[50:17.340 --> 50:19.940]  I don't know if I trust the integrity of the immunity bullet.
[50:20.060 --> 50:22.340]  I don't know if it's designed to kill. Is it a killable bullet?
[50:22.720 --> 50:23.100]  It's a bullet.
[50:24.220 --> 50:28.160]  I think I would want the guy to be definitely dead before I use the immunity bullet.
[50:28.840 --> 50:33.180]  So wait, you'd be immune from shooting the sky? What do you mean?
[50:33.760 --> 50:33.940]  No.
[50:33.940 --> 50:34.840]  You just want to kill a guy.
[50:35.240 --> 50:36.500]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[50:37.100 --> 50:38.180]  You're not getting this.
[50:38.380 --> 50:41.820]  I think we have different understandings of how the protocol of the immunity bullet works.
[50:42.520 --> 50:49.860]  I was under the assumption you commit the thing, and then you fire the bullet to clear yourself of what you did.
[50:49.960 --> 50:50.800]  Why would that be?
[50:50.880 --> 50:54.220]  Why would that be the way that it works?
[50:54.540 --> 50:56.360]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[50:56.360 --> 51:03.000]  Because to be like Yosemite Sam and fire a bullet into the air and be like, uh-uh, I'm immune.
[51:03.460 --> 51:05.740]  The only thing you're immune from is what the bullet lands on.
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.260]  Well, there are things I want to be immune for potentially that don't involve me shooting a thing.
[51:10.860 --> 51:13.700]  That's the limitation of this immunity bullet.
[51:13.820 --> 51:18.740]  That's why I specifically said this is literally a bullet being fired out of a gun, right?
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.440]  Because I had the same thought.
[51:20.660 --> 51:24.860]  Think of it this way, Andrew. You're immune from the consequences of firing the gun.
[51:24.860 --> 51:27.880]  Do you want it to be an immunity gun with one shot?
[51:28.880 --> 51:31.940]  I don't understand why you guys are overcomplicating this.
[51:32.360 --> 51:32.520]  What?
[51:32.700 --> 51:33.220]  You do.
[51:33.920 --> 51:34.340]  What?
[51:35.500 --> 51:35.920]  Wow.
[51:36.480 --> 51:42.140]  You commit the crime, and then you say, or it doesn't even have to be a crime.
[51:42.420 --> 51:47.300]  You're having a dinner. You burn all the steaks. You don't want to be responsible for it.
[51:47.820 --> 51:51.760]  You fire the immunity bullet, and everyone's like, oh, we can't be mad at him.
[51:51.820 --> 51:54.420]  No, that's an immunity idol you're describing.
[51:54.420 --> 51:56.360]  You're conflating two things.
[51:56.680 --> 52:02.980]  This is literally a bullet that fires, and you're immune from the consequences of firing the gun.
[52:03.460 --> 52:07.980]  You're on the hook for the burnt steaks. You're only immune from the hole that you made in the ceiling.
[52:08.380 --> 52:10.000]  Okay, well then give me an immunity grill.
[52:10.740 --> 52:11.440]  Then I'm happy.
[52:13.640 --> 52:16.980]  Give me some immunity grates, and I'm good.
[52:18.020 --> 52:19.180]  Immunity grates.
[52:20.720 --> 52:23.260]  Are all movies filmed in the third person?
[52:23.260 --> 52:27.940]  No, no, no. We have to end this episode. This is over. This is over. Save that.
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.380]  But why? This is so fun.
[52:29.760 --> 52:33.120]  This is done. This is done. We have to save it for the next one. This is it.
[52:33.800 --> 52:35.660]  I never want to talk about this again.
[52:37.700 --> 52:39.280]  I absolutely agree with you, Gavin.
[52:40.500 --> 52:42.000]  I have a game today.
[52:43.180 --> 52:45.040]  I don't know if we want to hop into a game.
[52:45.540 --> 52:46.920]  I would love to hop into a game.
[52:47.520 --> 52:50.800]  It was a long time ago on our previous podcast.
[52:50.800 --> 52:52.700]  It was called F*** Face.
[52:53.140 --> 53:02.280]  And we were talking about people's teeth, and would we be able to recognize the person by their teeth on the Ian F*** Face logo?
[53:03.100 --> 53:03.600]  Oh, Jesus.
[53:04.020 --> 53:04.580]  Oh, God.
[53:05.800 --> 53:07.080]  Oh, boy. Okay.
[53:07.500 --> 53:08.300]  Alright, round one.
[53:08.820 --> 53:10.540]  Okay, let's see some teeth.
[53:11.320 --> 53:14.970]  Oh, no. I hate this game already.
[53:15.660 --> 53:16.100]  Why?
[53:17.480 --> 53:19.560]  It's just very unpleasant.
[53:19.560 --> 53:21.960]  Now, is that going to be one of the five of us?
[53:22.580 --> 53:22.780]  Yeah.
[53:23.680 --> 53:24.040]  Oh.
[53:24.520 --> 53:24.880]  Okay.
[53:25.140 --> 53:27.200]  I'm sorry for our audience, this is a very visual bit.
[53:27.200 --> 53:27.860]  Yeah, it is.
[53:28.040 --> 53:30.760]  On YouTube, this might be better to watch there or look at the Instagram.
[53:31.520 --> 53:34.580]  I guess it's thinking Gracie, maybe? From the Krutof?
[53:35.640 --> 53:36.000]  Oh.
[53:36.680 --> 53:38.360]  We just said it's one of the five of us, didn't we?
[53:38.800 --> 53:39.040]  Yeah.
[53:39.780 --> 53:40.240]  Oh, okay.
[53:40.460 --> 53:41.740]  Okay, so your guess is Gracie.
[53:43.260 --> 53:44.880]  I guess it is. Yeah.
[53:45.280 --> 53:48.600]  I guess it's me? I don't think my teeth are that straight.
[53:49.640 --> 53:51.340]  Yeah, that's right. That's Eric.
[53:51.820 --> 53:52.660]  Is it really?
[53:53.120 --> 53:55.480]  I got some nice toppers there, bud.
[53:55.520 --> 53:56.540]  You're not doing too bad, dude.
[53:56.840 --> 53:57.480]  What about this one?
[53:59.260 --> 54:01.720]  Oh, that's clearly... I know, that's easy.
[54:02.380 --> 54:03.660]  That's, yeah, that's...
[54:03.660 --> 54:07.520]  Those are the lips of Andrew Panton. I would recognize them anywhere.
[54:07.660 --> 54:09.720]  Oh, old toothless fucker.
[54:09.940 --> 54:10.220]  Me.
[54:11.620 --> 54:13.540]  Still never seen your teeth, I'm convinced of it.
[54:14.440 --> 54:15.320]  What about this one?
[54:16.840 --> 54:17.040]  Oh.
[54:17.960 --> 54:18.600]  That's Nick.
[54:19.120 --> 54:19.760]  That's Nick.
[54:20.100 --> 54:20.760]  It has to be Nick.
[54:21.080 --> 54:25.360]  Nick's looks like freakishly natural in a way that is very odd.
[54:26.020 --> 54:28.040]  That looks like it should be there.
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.480]  It's also old-timey and black and white.
[54:30.700 --> 54:32.360]  The black and white makes it look like I'm gonna eat you.
[54:35.520 --> 54:40.260]  I think if we had to pick so far, I would say Nick's are the regulation ENT.
[54:40.880 --> 54:42.240]  That is a nightmare.
[54:42.620 --> 54:43.660]  100% Gavin.
[54:44.020 --> 54:44.720]  Yeah, definitely.
[54:44.720 --> 54:45.520]  And that would be me.
[54:46.560 --> 54:46.760]  Yeah.
[54:47.260 --> 54:50.380]  That's from this picture of me and my granddad.
[54:56.520 --> 54:57.820]  Last but not least.
[54:58.880 --> 54:59.640]  Oh, yeah.
[54:59.800 --> 55:00.380]  Oh, boy.
[55:00.380 --> 55:01.320]  There you go.
[55:01.620 --> 55:05.600]  Now, here's the thing. I was with Andrew that Nick's look like the regulation teeth.
[55:05.680 --> 55:08.600]  I think the black and white really helps to, like, really set it in there.
[55:08.640 --> 55:15.140]  But something about Geoff's big mouth, his gob just smack in the middle of that thing really fits for Ian to me.
[55:15.140 --> 55:17.980]  You can feel the joy in the smile.
[55:18.500 --> 55:23.180]  Geoff's is hitting me with, like, annoying orange vibes is the way I feel about it.
[55:23.180 --> 55:24.500]  Oh, yeah.
[55:24.860 --> 55:27.080]  Geoff, you look like the annoying orange.
[55:27.840 --> 55:28.900]  Yeah, I'll take that.
[55:29.660 --> 55:33.440]  While we're at it, I've always gotten Jenna Marbles vibes from Andrew.
[55:33.620 --> 55:34.920]  So it's like, I can see that.
[55:37.300 --> 55:41.520]  The thing that made me laugh the most while I was doing this, aside from these stupid teeth pictures,
[55:41.700 --> 55:45.900]  is that I wanted to remove the original teeth from the sketch.
[55:46.400 --> 55:51.960]  So I used Photoshop to... I just selected it and then did like a content aware delete thing
[55:51.960 --> 55:54.640]  where it's supposed to just fill it with the surroundings.
[55:55.420 --> 55:57.480]  This is the abomination that it made.
[55:57.960 --> 55:59.960]  Oh, my God.
[56:00.380 --> 56:01.580]  What the fuck?
[56:02.620 --> 56:03.580]  It made a face.
[56:03.580 --> 56:05.060]  It made an Ian face.
[56:05.220 --> 56:07.200]  Look, it's got eyes, nose, and a mouth.
[56:07.360 --> 56:08.000]  Holy shit.
[56:08.220 --> 56:11.300]  I'm gonna go ahead and make the thumbnail right now for this episode.
[56:11.600 --> 56:11.760]  That's perfect.
[56:11.760 --> 56:16.280]  Now it's a guy with a lump on his head, like Tom and Jerry, looking really pissed.
[56:16.540 --> 56:17.320]  Oh, my God.
[56:17.500 --> 56:18.860]  Where did he get that from?
[56:19.280 --> 56:21.120]  That's AI shit right there, dude.
[56:21.300 --> 56:23.180]  That's why we shouldn't use AI.
[56:23.480 --> 56:23.840]  No.
[56:24.460 --> 56:25.220]  That's terrifying.
[56:25.300 --> 56:26.760]  That's insane.
[56:27.740 --> 56:29.280]  I kind of want to get a tattoo.
[56:29.960 --> 56:38.800]  I decided I'm going to write a short story, but exclusively in the signature boxes of iPads at checkouts.
[56:39.060 --> 56:44.280]  I'm going to write it one word at a time and hope that it ends up somewhere.
[56:45.820 --> 56:47.660]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.800]  You know when you sign for your credit card or whatever?
[56:51.380 --> 56:53.880]  You want your signing stuff to get, like, hacked?
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.420]  Or how would it end up somewhere?
[56:55.580 --> 56:56.500]  Where does all that go?
[56:56.580 --> 56:58.660]  Where does my signature go?
[56:59.600 --> 57:02.020]  I assume to the business and then the bank?
[57:02.720 --> 57:05.440]  So the bank will have my story.
[57:05.900 --> 57:06.880]  I don't know.
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.080]  Are you pitching Payday DLC right now?
[57:10.160 --> 57:12.500]  We got to go rob a bank to get your narrative?
[57:14.220 --> 57:18.180]  And open up all the safety deposit boxes word by word?
[57:20.360 --> 57:23.060]  Does the item in some way have to relate to the word?
[57:24.300 --> 57:25.120]  What do you mean?
[57:25.860 --> 57:32.880]  Like, for you to be able to use a word, does it have to, like, maybe be somehow incorporated to the product in some way?
[57:33.020 --> 57:34.020]  Or that you can make the word...
[57:34.020 --> 57:36.280]  Well, no, because then the whole story would be about groceries.
[57:37.840 --> 57:38.560]  What if...
[57:39.660 --> 57:40.460]  I'm with you, Andrew.
[57:40.880 --> 57:42.640]  Maybe this is a separate idea.
[57:43.060 --> 57:49.060]  But what if you had to write a short story like that, but you could only use words you found in the grocery store on products?
[57:49.580 --> 57:50.940]  And then you had to buy that product.
[57:50.940 --> 57:56.500]  So if you wanted to use the word fabulous, you had to go, like, track down something that says fabulous on it and then buy it.
[57:56.880 --> 57:59.800]  You have to buy your words for your short story.
[58:00.100 --> 58:02.840]  I think it's a difficult enough handicap as it is.
[58:03.580 --> 58:13.460]  How about as a test, we each buy, like, three items and then have to write a story based off of words that are on that product?
[58:14.380 --> 58:15.780]  As a test, we would just evaluate.
[58:15.780 --> 58:16.160]  I like that.
[58:18.220 --> 58:20.900]  So wait, we're buying three things and we're putting in three words?
[58:21.460 --> 58:24.680]  No. Well, sure, we could do three words or it could be as long as you want.
[58:24.840 --> 58:27.960]  So I, for example, I have an empty bottle of Coke in front of me.
[58:28.920 --> 58:30.260]  Naturally is on the bottle.
[58:30.460 --> 58:33.020]  I can have natural. I now have natural in my reserve.
[58:33.360 --> 58:35.020]  I got flavored. I got cola.
[58:35.920 --> 58:36.520]  I got Quebec.
[58:38.120 --> 58:40.080]  How would you start your story with these words?
[58:42.520 --> 58:43.320]  Naturally. Naturally.
[58:45.820 --> 58:46.900]  Naturally Quebec.
[58:47.500 --> 58:50.360]  Yeah, it's like naturally Quebec. Quebec is caffeine free.
[58:51.540 --> 58:56.820]  And provides 70% of the daily recommended niacin or whatever it is.
[58:58.720 --> 59:08.180]  You have to try to both convey a story or a sentence that is coherent while also trying to not expose what your item is, I guess.
[59:08.280 --> 59:09.780]  And then we could reveal what we bought.
[59:10.440 --> 59:11.980]  Alright, I'll try that too.
[59:11.980 --> 59:16.200]  We'll do this. Can everybody have it ready by next week for the next episode?
[59:16.900 --> 59:19.020]  I found out something about Eric.
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.960]  You found out something about Eric?
[59:22.360 --> 59:24.140]  Yeah, that's you by the way.
[59:24.220 --> 59:34.300]  I found out that you don't like being squeezed by the blood pressure inflatables.
[59:34.300 --> 59:36.020]  Oh yeah, have I never talked about that?
[59:36.340 --> 59:40.360]  No, I don't think so.
[59:41.100 --> 59:46.260]  And I'll get surgery and none of that bothers me or whatever.
[59:46.540 --> 59:50.400]  When I get my blood pressure taken, I tell them beforehand.
[59:50.520 --> 59:56.880]  It's the thing where it goes around your bicep and then it's squeezed to get your blood pressure.
[59:57.560 --> 01:00:03.560]  Before they do it, I tell them, hey, you're about to get a reading that you're going to look at and be like, oh, that's a little high.
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.880]  It's not high blood pressure.
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:13.440]  These things I hate so desperately and wish that you never had to do this.
[01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:15.700]  It makes me so anxious.
[01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:18.800]  Yes, it makes me so anxious it makes my heart race.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.180]  I hate them.
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:26.760]  So I want to pitch to you, I get like 10 of them and we put them all over you and inflate them all at the same time.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.980]  Oh, like immersion therapy.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.060]  We get like an average reading across all your limbs.
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.720]  I mean, we're not going to do that.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.360]  You can keep pitching it as far as you want to.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:39.380]  Hey, Geoff, we're going to put you in a bucket full of snakes.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.820]  Like, what are you talking about?
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.400]  Oh, is this like a snake level thing for you?
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:45.960]  Yeah, I hate it.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:50.960]  I genuinely... I can't look at it while they do it.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.320]  I have to like... I tense up and won't move while it's on me.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:55.740]  I hate it.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.940]  Could you watch it get done to me?
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.200]  Yeah, it doesn't bother me for other people.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.780]  I just know how it makes me feel.
[01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.300]  Yeah, it doesn't matter. I don't give a shit.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.820]  Yeah, let's put 10 on you. I don't care.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.180]  Let's put 10 on you and put you in a bucket of snakes.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:08.840]  I don't give a shit.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:17.000]  In the interest of never doing a Geoff is scared of snakes bit, I'm full support of you here.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:24.780]  What if we make a giant slice of bread and Gavin, you can lay on top of it and slowly lower it into a pool.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.300]  Like, what are we talking about?
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:31.920]  Just imagine the bread is like a pool float and you ride it into the water.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.940]  That's not funny, guys.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.560]  Wait, hang on, wait, hang on, hang on. How did you learn this about me, Gavin?
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:43.900]  Huh?
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.260]  How did you learn this about me?
[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:54.820]  The most, the most bullshit I've ever heard in my life.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.600]  Back to ballistic, everybody.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.500]  What the fuck is this?
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:08.800]  By the way, I was kind of disappointed that we don't really have a good URL to push people to other than, you know, Patreon slash regulation pod.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.820]  It's a bit of a mouthful. So I was hoping we had like a much sure URL. We don't.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:18.120]  Someone else took all those. So I registered, uh, Regulatreon.com.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.260]  You did it.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.460]  Yep, and it forwards to our Patreon.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.820]  Wait, it's what?
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.030]  Regulatreon.com
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.620]  How do you spell that?
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.860]  That's the issue, isn't it?
[01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:35.240]  R-E-G-U-L-A-T-R-I-O-N
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.780]  There it is. So go to Regulatreon.com
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.600]  Insane.
[01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:41.660]  E-O-N
[01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:42.300]  There you go.
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:51.740]  Oh, I put it in the show notes. So you guys can go scroll down and check out Regulatreon.com
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:53.080]  With an E.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.480]  Yep. Uh-huh. All right. Well, thanks for listening. Go to Regulatreon.com
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.080]  Go subscribe now. Thank you guys so much for listening. Check out Regulation Gameplay.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.820]  Andrew, are you aware of a five-way Venn diagram?
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.020]  No.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:20.140]  So in a five-way Venn diagram, there are overlaps. And after talking with our friend Alyssa the other day,
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.400]  we started talking about, it was this conversation of, who do you think the leak was?
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:32.220]  And then going around in a circle and I said, I just don't know who knows what my fear is of the blood pressure cuff.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.380]  And then I'm like, well, it's just like knowing, you know, Geoff's fear of snakes, whatever.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:44.500]  And then Alyssa was like, yeah. And then I guess if there was like a boa constrictor, that would be like the worst of both worlds for you.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.300]  And thus was born the fear diagram.
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:57.360]  We need to figure out what all of our overlapping fears would be to get to the middle, which is the ultimate regulation fear.
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.700]  That's really funny.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.880]  It's very tough to figure out the fear diagram.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:07.440]  So the boa constrictor would be the perfect blend between Eric's fear of being squeezed and Geoff's fear of snakes.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:15.360]  And then we discussed also that Nick was potentially afraid of flying. And then Alyssa immediately screamed snakes on a plane.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:21.120]  So that would be the blend between Geoff and Nick.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.180]  That's really funny.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:27.600]  The thing we were lost on was what's Andrew's fear? What is yours, Andrew?
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.160]  I mean, I talked about that like surgical scenes in movies get me.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.200]  But that's like so specific.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.140]  Is it the blood or the cutting?
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.540]  I don't know. I don't know what it is.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.900]  So maybe like a gallbladder surgery on a snake would be a good blend.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.960]  But here's the thing with the five-way Venn diagram that we're looking at.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.040]  Is that not everyone overlaps AB.
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:01.100]  So if you look, if I'm at the top at B and Geoff is at the left side at A.
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:06.620]  I don't necessarily have a singular overlap with E who could potentially be Andrew.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:11.100]  I also really like that there's an ABCDE overlap of all five people.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.500]  Which is surely just death.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.140]  Like is there going to be anything more specific than that?
[01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.200]  I'm not scared of dying.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.020]  But yours isn't death, yours is wet bread.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.080]  You don't die from wet bread.
[01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.120]  I feel like it's the first thing I think about every morning.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:26.720]  What? Death?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.080]  Or just like being scared of it.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.520]  Maybe for like 10 seconds right as I wake up.
[01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:35.820]  And then after 10 seconds I'm like, oh, let's have a day.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.760]  Gavin, I think you might be more scared of that than bread, buddy.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:48.160]  If it's the first thing you think of every day and you have to talk yourself off the ledge so that you can have a day.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.900]  I'm not on any ledge, I just feel like it's the constant reminder of how much time has passed.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.500]  About six hours since you fell asleep.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.120]  But our homework.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.840]  How do we want to do this? Do we want to submit our own stories?
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.540]  Well, I think the idea is that we would do our stories and then people would have to try and guess which three things we had to buy.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.120]  Okay. Do you want me to go first?
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.800]  Sure, Andrew, do you want to go first?
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.280]  Okay, I'm going to go first.
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.900]  There's some pretty big clues for mine.
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:27.080]  I'd say, if you know your stuff, 2 out of 3, very obvious.
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:30.400]  The third one may be a little bit harder to figure out.
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.100]  Here's my story.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:38.540]  Major Snap Melon proudly serving the dark side oven-toasted Greg Hildebrand.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.860]  In Canada, this suggested destiny is applicable for refund.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:53.340]  So if you want to try to parse through that and guess what I got, there's some clues.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:53.940]  Right.
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.920]  Some sort of toastable thing.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.760]  Is one of them soda? Can I guess that?
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.240]  Yep, one of them is a soda.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:08.620]  You're right about that.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.800]  Is it caffeinated or is it a carbonated soda?
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.460]  It is a carbonated soda.
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.420]  Are there non-carbonated sodas?
[01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.120]  I don't know.
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:21.340]  A lot of people say soda. It could be a lot of things.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.880]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.500]  Respect.
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.500]  Is it Mountain Dew?
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:27.980]  Yes!
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.200]  One of them is Mountain Dew.
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.720]  Major Melon Mountain Dew.
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.320]  The Major Snap Melon thing led me to soda.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:44.560]  And I started poking around and googling what's a melon soda, what's something that's going around.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.800]  Is it this Major Melon Mountain Dew?
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:48.640]  Yeah, it is the Major Melon Mountain Dew.
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.660]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, there you go.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.080]  That's how I landed on that.
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.560]  Alright, Gavin, you guess what the Greg Hildebrandt thing is. Go ahead.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:56.620]  But you googled.
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:00.130]  Okay.
[01:08:00.830 --> 01:08:02.290]  So I can just google Greg.
[01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:07.570]  Oh, are we not supposed to? I mean, I was getting soda with Major Snap Melon and then went, what the fuck is that thing?
[01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:09.130]  Yeah, are we not supposed to google?
[01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:13.530]  Was that a rule I wasn't aware of? I'm sorry.
[01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.230]  Listen, there were no rules, I don't think.
[01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.710]  Oh, okay.
[01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:18.910]  I don't think, Andrew, I'm with you. I didn't think so either.
[01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:22.370]  That's why I googled, like, what the fuck was that, what was that soda flavor?
[01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:25.610]  Rice Krispies was my third thing.
[01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:27.870]  Snap Crackle Pop.
[01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:28.690]  Crackle Pop.
[01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:29.410]  Yep.
[01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:34.610]  And the oven toasted Rice Krispie Treat or something.
[01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:38.150]  It says oven toasted rice grain cereal on the front of it.
[01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.730]  So that is mine.
[01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.290]  What about y'all? What is your story?
[01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:45.050]  I could paste mine in.
[01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.810]  Go for it.
[01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:53.350]  With precaution, Charlie bounced on the ancient boulder above the volcanic mines, aware of the health hazards.
[01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:57.530]  Below is bursting with radiation and is not a well-ventilated environment.
[01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.750]  Charlie is a professional with the benefits of safety documents.
[01:09:01.710 --> 01:09:03.990]  Ash eruptions prevent Charlie's fat grip.
[01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:10.530]  The power of nature. Temperature causes Charlie's eyes and hands to be boiled and damaged by sharp objects.
[01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:12.130]  Life cannot be reused.
[01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.570]  That's fucking awesome.
[01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:19.330]  Do you think this has anything to do with his yard?
[01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:21.130]  Could it be yard stuff?
[01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:23.190]  Because he's been a lawn guy recently.
[01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.330]  So is one of them raid? Like a can of raid?
[01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:31.810]  No, there is one food, one non-food thing though.
[01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:32.870]  The other two are food.
[01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:35.470]  Oh wow, really? Oh my god.
[01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:36.770]  Actually, they're not really food.
[01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:40.310]  Oh, is one toothpaste?
[01:09:41.170 --> 01:09:41.250]  No.
[01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:42.190]  Damn.
[01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:43.310]  What about batteries?
[01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:45.250]  In your mouth? Oh, gum?
[01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:48.730]  Yeah, what the fuck? What's up with Charlie's fat grip?
[01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:53.610]  We had tea bags, some salt, and some night trial gloves.
[01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:55.230]  Great one.
[01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:56.150]  Wow.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:59.030]  That's fantastic. Good work, Gavin.
[01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.130]  And I think in that pitch you can see most of the words.
[01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.110]  I did turn it around for a few, I think, but most of the words were there.
[01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:08.510]  Fantastic. And there's all of our bubbly from our soda summer.
[01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.010]  Yeah, half of soda summer still...
[01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:13.090]  Yeah. And then also...
[01:10:14.230 --> 01:10:15.530]  Is it YouTube stuff?
[01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:18.010]  Oh yeah, that's our letter from the...
[01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:20.590]  What is the other thing? Is it a business card?
[01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:24.070]  Oh yeah, it's an iMac. Well, maybe I'll crop that.
[01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:27.470]  Yeah, I think maybe that might be the right way to do that.
[01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.910]  You better do it soon, because Geoff is just going to post this picture.
[01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:35.050]  I won't remember that in a week, when I'm hanging out out of town on vacation.
[01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:35.970]  You should delete that now.
[01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.550]  Yeah, just get rid of it right now.
[01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:42.030]  Okay, okay, okay. And finally, Geoff, go ahead.
[01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.110]  Okay, I'm going to post it and then I'll read it out loud to you, okay?
[01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:51.510]  Alright. Norm smelled dead. Raw, deep, ruthless. It permeated the farm. Not natural.
[01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.910]  Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, New Hampshire. Every place.
[01:10:55.530 --> 01:11:00.230]  Bittersweet, alchemical, acid, bacon. Notes of a not natural nectar. Murder.
[01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.610]  The family chain, saturated with lime and lecithin.
[01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:07.690]  Smoked and roasted. A thumb through the eyes, indicating a sacred, twisted ritual.
[01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:12.570]  Help. Love. Die. Notes pressed into the mouth with dark alderwood.
[01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:15.830]  Trademarks of the twisted convict. Norm mouthed to Tony.
[01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:19.150]  Vos just traveled here. With the woman. Your woman.
[01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:24.030]  Are we in the magazine aisle? Or book aisle? With this?
[01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:25.690]  No, it's all food.
[01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:27.510]  Okay. All food?
[01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:28.510]  Murder food.
[01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:29.790]  Murder food?
[01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:32.610]  Well, it's all food. Yeah, it's all stuff that goes in your mouth.
[01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:38.270]  Pepperidge Farms? Maybe? Is this a Pepperidge Farms product?
[01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:39.210]  Liquid Death.
[01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:40.390]  Liquid Death.
[01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.490]  Oh, shit!
[01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:44.730]  Yeah, Liquid Death was the first thing I grabbed.
[01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:46.370]  Murder Your Thirst, yadda yadda yadda.
[01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.570]  It had a lot of good stuff in it.
[01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.410]  Oh, that's fucking smart!
[01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:54.870]  I just don't think you guys will get the other two, because there's not a lot there, so I'm just going to post the photo.
[01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:55.410]  Okay.
[01:11:55.410 --> 01:12:02.790]  It's Tony's Chocolonely Bar, and then Bo's Bacon Dark.
[01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.230]  Oh, those are good!
[01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.930]  I haven't seen two of these.
[01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:11.690]  I think I could enter a puzzle tournament and do well.
[01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:17.750]  The problem with that is, how many people are casually entering a puzzle tournament?
[01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.710]  I feel like it might just be you.
[01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:24.810]  Everybody else, I think, they've invested countless hours.
[01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:29.450]  Oh, no, I'm saying, I think I'm at a point in my life right now where I could compete against those people in puzzles.
[01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:31.190]  I don't know how we got off on the puzzle thing.
[01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:33.050]  I was just talking about the video game deal.
[01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:41.370]  But now that you mention it, I think my puzzle skills are of a level that I could walk in and compete at a semi-professional level right now.
[01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:49.350]  This is your and Andrew's version of the Halo 2 times, where Andrew's going to try and have to beat your times on puzzles.
[01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:55.170]  Should we do a 500 and then maybe reveal to each other on the show how fast it took us to do?
[01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:57.290]  We do a puzzle reveal-off?
[01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:05.810]  Maybe like we submit, we give Eric our times and he can read off and see who does best to worst?
[01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.810]  I love that. I think that's really cool.
[01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.030]  Do you think that it should all be like the same puzzle?
[01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:13.430]  Yes, it has to be the same puzzle, yeah.
[01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.230]  And then we'll each time it and then we'll send it to Eric.
[01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:22.070]  I'll be taking a note of it and I'll see if we can put it together this week and get everything shipped over the next week.
[01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:23.930]  And then you guys have time and can do it.
[01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:25.530]  I haven't done a puzzle in a while.
[01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:33.550]  Thanks for listening. You know, we love you grinding up on that pole as Andrew is fond of saying in his song.
[01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:34.510]  Gavin, what's our URL?
[01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:37.750]  Regulatrion.com
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.790]  How do you shave without clogging a sink?
[01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:46.750]  You don't. Oh, actually.
[01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:51.870]  I mean, the answer I have is is is not far off from your answers.
[01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:55.610]  I shave outside. If I have to shave my beard off or something.
[01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:59.990]  Eric saw my outdoor shaving set up and he finds it repulsive.
[01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:08.990]  Just based on like your twisted fucking set, like this saw looking ass set up that you have for like.
[01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:12.970]  Here's the first image.
[01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:15.890]  This is this is where Gavin shaves.
[01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:32.850]  So you're looking at that and you're like, oh, this is just in the middle of it truly is just in the middle of there's the second image just under a box on the side of his house near two pieces of a broken mirror.
[01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.850]  Andrew thoughts.
[01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:35.330]  I think it's fine.
[01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:36.070]  Who cares?
[01:14:37.690 --> 01:14:43.150]  It's his fucking backyard standing in a bathroom at a mirror.
[01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:44.630]  I mean, there's a mirror out there.
[01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:45.510]  What do you want from him?
[01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:46.690]  It's fine. That's so interesting.
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:47.530]  You know, no, no.
[01:14:47.610 --> 01:14:48.190]  Here's the thing.
[01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:49.810]  That's a great question, Nick.
[01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.870]  Nick asks such a good question.
[01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.450]  Do you use the mirror?
[01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:55.770]  Do you crouch down?
[01:14:55.930 --> 01:15:05.210]  Well, Gavin, do you have any images you want to drop into this chat so that way people can see how you shave down like a monkey man?
[01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:05.830]  You have.
[01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:06.490]  Oh, you.
[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:07.270]  That.
[01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.870]  Now that.
[01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:09.850]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.450]  Okay.
[01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:11.070]  That.
[01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:13.730]  Lost me a little bit on that.
[01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.170]  What do you mean I've lost you?
[01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:17.850]  I also like to see in the mirror.
[01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:25.990]  For the audience that can't see this, because I doubt these images will come out.
[01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:34.510]  Gavin is in a squat as if he's taking a shit on the ground, shaving in front of the broken mirrors as close to Earth as he can get.
[01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:39.470]  You look like you're scared you're going to fall off the ground.
[01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:48.170]  The worst part of this setup is that I was cleaning out my gutters a few months ago, and I found a shitload of my beard up in one of the gutters.
[01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:49.770]  Oh, wow.
[01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:51.570]  Are you fucking serious?
[01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.510]  The birds had used it for nesting.
[01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:57.950]  That's great.
[01:15:59.070 --> 01:16:00.370]  So you're helping the birds.
[01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:04.050]  It was the inside of one of my cushions, my outdoor cushions.
[01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:06.550]  Squirrels have shredded that and the birds stole it.
[01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:10.450]  And then they also mixed it with a little bit of my beard for the optimal bird nest.
[01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:16.770]  Listen, as someone who's made a wrist pocket with Velcro, half of it is tapeable.
[01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:21.050]  And you put that part to the wall, the tapeable part that you peel.
[01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:25.110]  And then you put the other half that attaches to the back of the mirror.
[01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:27.230]  Yeah, sure. I'm just going to come and go.
[01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:30.090]  The first time I use it, I'm pulling that tape straight off of the Velcro.
[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:30.430]  No, you're not.
[01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.410]  Who the fuck do you think you are, respectfully?
[01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:35.270]  You're not Hercules, okay?
[01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:36.410]  That Velcro's going to stick.
[01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:39.850]  You think you're fucking sword in the stone?
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:41.050]  Like you're King Arthur?
[01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:43.290]  Like you're the fucking knight in shaver?
[01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:44.570]  Get out of here.
[01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:47.110]  That mirror's just coming off, it's going to stay.
[01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:48.110]  It's fine.
[01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:52.230]  Can you say anything like that?
[01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:55.110]  Just say respectfully and you get away with it?
[01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:59.870]  And when you get a haircut, they don't mess with it?
[01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:02.470]  No, they did. That's what I said last time I got a haircut.
[01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:03.010]  Oh.
[01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:05.690]  The guy Johnny Trimmed it, which was great.
[01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:07.030]  I didn't ask for it.
[01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:09.190]  Johnny Caviar?
[01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.510]  Johnny the Barber.
[01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:12.410]  Johnny the Barber.
[01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:17.430]  Yeah, but his name being Johnny doesn't...
[01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:19.330]  You're going to tell...
[01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.610]  We're going to... I don't believe that.
[01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:24.250]  And I think we're going to find out that you're a barber on the side.
[01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:24.830]  I'm not...
[01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:27.110]  Listen, I'm not in the Freemasons, okay?
[01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:30.170]  I don't... I can't claim the qualification.
[01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:38.170]  What if we find out that there is an actual Johnny Caviar who lives somewhere in the NIMO that Andrew has stolen the identity of?
[01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.350]  It's exactly what's going to... That's what's happening.
[01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:46.470]  There's a 72-year-old barber on Vancouver Island named Johnny Caviar.
[01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:50.630]  He was a 72-year-old barber when he was cutting hair at the old folks' home.
[01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:53.530]  And then he died and his identity was assumed.
[01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:54.670]  He might be dead.
[01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:01.330]  Andrew went there to get his hair cut one day and they're like, oh no, he's dead, but he left this box of stuff.
[01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.970]  Would you mail his death certificate?
[01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:05.190]  Andrew's like, yeah, sure, no problem.
[01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.030]  Trash.
[01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:08.790]  I take over the identity? No.
[01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.030]  Didn't happen.
[01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:11.210]  Johnny's great.
[01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:12.330]  Okay, what about this?
[01:18:12.770 --> 01:18:18.370]  We see who can hold the most water in their mouth and then gauze the water into a cup and we take the measurement that way.
[01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:19.490]  I like that.
[01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:21.730]  I'm totally fine. I think that's great.
[01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.570]  I think it's fantastic.
[01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:23.730]  And that's the throat goat.
[01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.450]  Yeah.
[01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:31.110]  Nick doesn't sound like he's in, but I feel like on the day of, he will be.
[01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:31.830]  Yeah, probably.
[01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:37.910]  So we'll all just sit around a table and gauze into like a Pyrex and see who wins.
[01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:39.130]  Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:40.470]  I think that's a good idea.
[01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:45.150]  Well, I think it should probably be colored liquid so that way we can like visually we want it to be stunning.
[01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:45.570]  Fantastic idea.
[01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:46.910]  And we should all have different colors.
[01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:50.890]  Like I can be green, you can be red, like that kind of thing.
[01:18:51.210 --> 01:18:51.810]  Andrew, are you in?
[01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:53.770]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:55.010]  He's still looking at wood.
[01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:56.090]  He's looking at wood.
[01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:57.310]  I think he's doing it already.
[01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:58.850]  He's trying to see how much water he can fit in his mouth.
[01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.870]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:03.930]  Do you have like a way of measuring the water though?
[01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:04.810]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:08.730]  It's fucking morbid.
[01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:09.890]  Jesus Christ.
[01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:13.230]  This is the best show in the world.
[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.030]  Why are you holding it?
[01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:18.570]  You're not going to make any more.
[01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:20.730]  If anything, you're going to lose it the longer you hold it.
[01:19:21.810 --> 01:19:24.510]  Holding it in makes absolutely no fucking sense.
[01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:30.770]  I mean, no, the problem was I didn't realize the thing I was going to spit it into had water in it already.
[01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.210]  So that was a real conundrum of what do I do?
[01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:36.030]  That's a real Die Hard 3 problem right there.
[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:38.710]  Yeah, I guess, you know...
[01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:41.070]  You're about to spit it into a cup full of toothpaste water.
[01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:43.790]  I mean, I just spit it out.
[01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.030]  I don't know how to measure this.
[01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:48.510]  I don't really know what I accomplished here.
[01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.610]  I don't even know how big this cup is.
[01:19:53.710 --> 01:19:55.010]  I don't even have a context.
[01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:57.870]  Anyway, I'm getting my reps in.
[01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:58.550]  I'm getting practice.
[01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:59.650]  I need some technique.
[01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:02.130]  Maybe we can incorporate the Gerpler somehow.
[01:20:02.710 --> 01:20:04.350]  That's what I drank it out of.
[01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:06.430]  I had a Gerpler on my pants, that's why I was like...
[01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:10.110]  What if the new Gerpler has lines on it?
[01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:13.290]  Like the throat goat Gerpler.
[01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:15.830]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:20.450]  Okay, what if each of the lines is how much liquid we all hold?
[01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:24.250]  So that way you can know if you hold more than Nick but less than Eric.
[01:20:25.170 --> 01:20:26.950]  And Nick just said the throatler.
[01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:28.630]  The throatler!
[01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:31.190]  Yeah, you can measure your throat to our throats.
[01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:32.310]  I love this!
[01:20:32.530 --> 01:20:34.130]  A regulation throatler.
[01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:37.830]  Who do you think of the regulation crew?
[01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.130]  Who do you think is the best badminton player?
[01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:42.050]  Me.
[01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:43.210]  Right now?
[01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:45.250]  I used to play all the time as a kid.
[01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:47.250]  Yeah, I was a pretty big player.
[01:20:47.530 --> 01:20:48.810]  Geoff says him.
[01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.950]  See, I'm thinking I could just wipe the floor with the lawyer.
[01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:53.730]  Should we have a badminton tournament?
[01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:55.070]  I think so.
[01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.930]  We can!
[01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.490]  I don't think it would be that hard to set up.
[01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:02.830]  Can you play on like a regular volleyball net?
[01:21:03.490 --> 01:21:05.230]  Or is it like a lower net? I don't remember.
[01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:07.370]  I think it's lower.
[01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:10.690]  I think we just buy a kit and throw it in the...
[01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:12.370]  Like take it down to Zilker Park probably.
[01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:14.010]  But it needs to be regulation height.
[01:21:14.450 --> 01:21:15.550]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.570]  Like Walmart, you can get like a $20 kit pretty easily.
[01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.270]  Okay.
[01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:20.250]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.810]  This is good to know.
[01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.270]  Oh, 80 bucks.
[01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.830]  Here you go.
[01:21:23.890 --> 01:21:24.690]  Do we want to do doubles?
[01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:25.670]  Oh, that's more than I thought.
[01:21:26.010 --> 01:21:26.890]  Yeah, I think 2v2.
[01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:29.150]  And then the winning team goes head-to-head.
[01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:30.130]  Like, that's how you do it.
[01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:31.210]  Oh, wow.
[01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.910]  That's great.
[01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:37.230]  Speaking of ending, your time listening to this podcast has come to a close.
[01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:38.510]  At least this episode.
[01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:44.510]  And we would like you to continue the journey with us by going to our website that Gavin loves to say...
[01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.910]  Regulatrion.com
[01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.630]  You were, by the way, Gavin, right on top of that.
[01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:50.370]  Thank you so much.
[01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:52.070]  I thought you were going to say it.
[01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:54.370]  Why would I say...
[01:21:54.370 --> 01:21:55.730]  Why would he set you up?
[01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:57.950]  Why would I set you...
[01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:00.290]  We'll see you next time!
[01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.970]  Gavin's late.
[01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.390]  Crazy.
[01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.770]  Not yet.
[01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.710]  He has seconds.
[01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:08.270]  He's got 30 seconds.
[01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.850]  What?
[01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.950]  I think it says 11.
[01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:13.030]  Yeah, but it's within the minute.
[01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:16.010]  Didn't we have a whole run of this on the show?
[01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.390]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:17.070]  Well, hold on.
[01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:18.070]  Hold on.
[01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:19.230]  He's got 20 seconds.
[01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:20.650]  God, I didn't get a chance to test my recording.
[01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:21.390]  I hope it's going well.
[01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:22.510]  I don't want to stop it now.
[01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:25.010]  I don't know if I like new Geoff.
[01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.850]  What does that mean?
[01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:27.610]  I'm not sure if I like it.
[01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:28.290]  I'm still working.
[01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.770]  10 seconds.
[01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:32.970]  I think I will like it, but I'm still adjusting.
[01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:34.970]  I don't know what that means.
[01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:36.410]  I'm the same old Geoff.
[01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.150]  He's here.
[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:37.850]  It's on time.
[01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:38.690]  Damn it.
[01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.010]  Oh, man.
[01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:41.250]  You really cut...
[01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.550]  You were cutting it close.
[01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:45.950]  You guys play against each other in FIFA.
[01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:47.450]  That's what I've been saying.
[01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:48.670]  I've been trying to get that together.
[01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:50.570]  Are we playing or simming it?
[01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:51.730]  Who have you been playing it to?
[01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.890]  Because this is the first time I'm hearing it.
[01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:54.030]  And it sounds like Gavin hasn't heard it either.
[01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:56.110]  No, I've been trying to get Gavin to do it for a week.
[01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:57.390]  I texted Gavin and Nick.
[01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:58.550]  Nick can back me up on this.
[01:22:58.750 --> 01:23:00.070]  I said, when are we doing it?
[01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:01.650]  And you said, we're not doing it yet.
[01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:03.410]  Yeah, well...
[01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:04.090]  I chased him, didn't I?
[01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.930]  No.
[01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:05.810]  Well, here.
[01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.950]  Let's circle back on this.
[01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:10.950]  Wait, you just called him on that and he said, yeah, no, well.
[01:23:11.190 --> 01:23:11.870]  That's awesome.
[01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:12.550]  No, no, no, no.
[01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:14.230]  Shut the fuck up, Eric.
[01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:15.070]  Give it up.
[01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:15.710]  You're doing this.
[01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:17.890]  Let me go.
[01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:19.630]  You fucking idiot, Eric.
[01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:21.250]  Let me go full Nick or whatever Nick said.
[01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:23.630]  Eric said like three words this whole podcast.
[01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:26.090]  I just repeated what you said, Andrew.
[01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.350]  Yeah, but you tried to make a point.
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:28.390]  This is a whole...
[01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.990]  We're going to get into a whole lot of garbage here.
[01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:30.870]  Oh, goodness.
[01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:31.990]  I texted...
[01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:34.470]  I was in a group text with you, Nick, and Gavin
[01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:35.490]  trying to get this done.
[01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:37.630]  Gavin never replied, true or false?
[01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:38.990]  He did not reply.
[01:23:39.210 --> 01:23:40.250]  He never replied.
[01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:41.510]  He didn't acknowledge, didn't reply.
[01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.950]  On text?
[01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:42.690]  It was on the schedule.
[01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:42.950]  Yeah.
[01:23:43.090 --> 01:23:44.130]  Yes, on text.
[01:23:44.130 --> 01:23:45.630]  I can't text you.
[01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:46.450]  I have no signal.
[01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:47.630]  I don't know what to do about it.
[01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:49.350]  I have to hold my...
[01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:51.330]  I have to go upstairs and hold my phone above my head
[01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:52.470]  because it doesn't use the internet.
[01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:53.710]  It uses freaking cellular.
[01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:54.990]  I can't...
[01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:56.050]  Fuck me, you idiot.
[01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:57.270]  We work together.
[01:23:58.390 --> 01:24:00.950]  We've been texting for years.
[01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:02.530]  For years.
[01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:03.990]  I walk away from my...
[01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.850]  I come back to my phone
[01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:06.630]  and something I sent an hour ago hasn't...
[01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:10.190]  I don't have as many freaking red exclamation marks
[01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:12.530]  as I do with anyone else as I do with you.
[01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.150]  Can you settle something for me, Andrew?
[01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:15.550]  Do you have Slack on your phone?
[01:24:16.170 --> 01:24:16.370]  Yeah.
[01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.970]  Yeah, I do.
[01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.690]  Of course.
[01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.090]  Okay.
[01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.550]  Wait.
[01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:21.090]  What do you mean?
[01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.770]  So...
[01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:23.750]  It's on the Umidigi?
[01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.130]  We need to...
[01:24:25.130 --> 01:24:26.010]  It's on the Bison, yeah.
[01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:28.950]  We need to talk about what happened in the general chat.
[01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:30.430]  What the fuck?
[01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.090]  In the general chat?
[01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.850]  Oh, the messages?
[01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:36.490]  Yeah, there were a bunch of messages.
[01:24:36.810 --> 01:24:37.770]  My mom was over.
[01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.830]  Decided to do some cleaning that I wasn't aware of.
[01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:43.530]  And I didn't...
[01:24:43.530 --> 01:24:45.010]  I wasn't paying attention to my phone.
[01:24:45.090 --> 01:24:46.350]  And then like an hour later, I looked
[01:24:46.350 --> 01:24:48.690]  and Eric thought I got hacked.
[01:24:50.890 --> 01:24:54.490]  Because my mom decided to clean my desk area
[01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:56.630]  which included wiping down my keyboard.
[01:24:57.170 --> 01:25:01.050]  I love that you can see where she started.
[01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:03.650]  She did the number row and then she did QWERTY
[01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:05.670]  and she was doing it row by row.
[01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:07.370]  And then she starts again.
[01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:09.450]  She gave it all a second pass.
[01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:11.350]  I want to see what you guys think about this.
[01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:13.750]  I don't want to out the friend because I'm not sure
[01:25:13.750 --> 01:25:16.750]  if they'd be comfortable with the world knowing
[01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:17.790]  that they're friends with Eric and I.
[01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.850]  Okay.
[01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:20.670]  I can get how that would be a detractor.
[01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:22.810]  But we were hanging out with this friend
[01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:26.450]  who has a cool project that they work on.
[01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:27.170]  It's like their job.
[01:25:27.370 --> 01:25:30.090]  And we were talking about scheduling another meetup.
[01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:31.930]  And we were like, well, what about...
[01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:34.350]  In the process, we were like,
[01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:36.390]  how are you handling your workload
[01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:37.250]  with the stuff that you're doing?
[01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:39.650]  And they said, well, I do it all on Mondays.
[01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:41.130]  I just get the whole thing done on Mondays.
[01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:42.370]  I boss my ass on Mondays
[01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:44.870]  and basically just get all of my work done on that day.
[01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:47.590]  And I was like, oh, that's pretty smart if you can do it.
[01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:48.850]  And they only have one project
[01:25:48.850 --> 01:25:49.910]  they're really working on right now.
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:50.670]  So I was like, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:52.170]  And then we were trying to figure out
[01:25:52.170 --> 01:25:53.190]  when to get together again.
[01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.710]  And Eric said, well, what about next Friday?
[01:25:54.710 --> 01:25:56.630]  And they said, I tend to try.
[01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:58.330]  I don't want to schedule stuff on Fridays
[01:25:58.330 --> 01:25:59.810]  because I want to start my weekend early.
[01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:02.410]  And we were like, oh, OK, I guess that makes sense.
[01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:04.410]  But then I was thinking about it in bed last night.
[01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:06.250]  And I was like, doesn't your weekend start on Tuesday?
[01:26:07.390 --> 01:26:08.950]  You only work one day a week.
[01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.710]  Yeah, if you've slotted everything to be one day.
[01:26:12.150 --> 01:26:15.370]  I think you're oversimplifying what they were saying.
[01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:18.090]  But I will say I agree with you.
[01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:19.990]  What the fuck are they thinking, baby?
[01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:22.530]  Just say I don't want to get together again.
[01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:27.350]  Is it a friendly hangout or is it work related meeting?
[01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:28.090]  No, it's friendly.
[01:26:28.190 --> 01:26:30.310]  It's kind of like what we do with Nick and Jason.
[01:26:31.190 --> 01:26:33.710]  Right, but that wouldn't mean...
[01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:35.210]  that wouldn't overtake the weekend.
[01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.750]  Even if your weekend started,
[01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.570]  and it's a friendly hangout,
[01:26:38.710 --> 01:26:39.550]  then that's still the weekend.
[01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:40.650]  I think we agree.
[01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:42.110]  I think we agree with you, Gavin.
[01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.470]  I think we're five guys
[01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.430]  in a Discord call agreeing with each other.
[01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:48.350]  I think it sounds like three people
[01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:49.550]  where two of them are hanging out
[01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:50.490]  and one of them's at work.
[01:26:50.490 --> 01:26:55.250]  Okay, now that sounds like an accurate assessment
[01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:59.210]  of exactly what this relationship is to a T.
[01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:09.530]  You have no idea how right you are.
[01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:13.830]  Man, you just hit the nail on the fucking head.
[01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:16.050]  That might be the perfect distillation
[01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:17.530]  of that relationship.
[01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:19.230]  Jesus Christ.
[01:27:19.410 --> 01:27:19.670]  Oh, man.
[01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.010]  You need to be here, Gavin,
[01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:22.210]  because you have become
[01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:24.430]  the absolute worst influence on Nick,
[01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:26.070]  and it is so fascinating
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:29.070]  to see Nick unravel.
[01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.470]  I've learned that there are new
[01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:32.570]  and improved ways to fail those heists
[01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:34.050]  that I didn't think were even possible.
[01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:39.750]  And it has bled into other facets of our work.
[01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:41.290]  You have turned Nick
[01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:44.630]  into a chaotic, unpredictable mess.
[01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:47.730]  It was started in GTA,
[01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:49.410]  it bled into what we did
[01:27:49.410 --> 01:27:50.550]  our last Twitch stream.
[01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:51.710]  Eric was like,
[01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:54.430]  I want to tell Gavin this story about speed.
[01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.950]  And then Nick was like,
[01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.490]  well, let me sync us up for the stream.
[01:27:57.610 --> 01:27:59.230]  And then it was like, okay, we'll do that.
[01:27:59.470 --> 01:28:00.750]  And then as soon as we sync,
[01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.270]  Nick just went, okay, we're live.
[01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:03.330]  Like nobody.
[01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:05.810]  And we were like three minutes early.
[01:28:06.230 --> 01:28:07.930]  And so then Eric just had to talk
[01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:09.050]  about speed for three minutes.
[01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.230]  Nick is unpredictable right now
[01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:13.490]  in a way that is so uncharacteristic
[01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:15.150]  of how I've known Nick
[01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:16.590]  for like the past four years.
[01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:17.510]  And it's great.
[01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.470]  You know what?
[01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.270]  Andrew, I'm glad you brought this up.
[01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:21.370]  And I feel like maybe it's time
[01:28:21.370 --> 01:28:22.470]  to finally talk about something
[01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:24.470]  that I have been keeping secret
[01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:25.270]  for a long time.
[01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:29.410]  This is what we call the Gavin effect.
[01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:31.930]  And the most clear example of it,
[01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:34.050]  I think I can give to you all
[01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.550]  is not a part of this podcast,
[01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:37.510]  but certainly podcast adjacent, I guess,
[01:28:37.950 --> 01:28:38.770]  in some roles.
[01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:40.470]  You guys remember Michael Jones
[01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.650]  used to work at Achievement Hunter with us?
[01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:42.850]  He does the food podcast.
[01:28:43.890 --> 01:28:45.770]  Completely different human being
[01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:47.070]  before I introduced him to Gavin.
[01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:51.550]  He's like calm, respectful, quiet.
[01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:54.370]  Did like to do crossword puzzles a lot.
[01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:55.270]  I don't buy any of that.
[01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:56.210]  Kind of like a deep thinker.
[01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:58.510]  Mousy, nerdy guy.
[01:28:58.630 --> 01:28:59.590]  And then I introduced him to Gavin
[01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:00.490]  and like three weeks later,
[01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:01.590]  he turned into Jersey trash
[01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:02.890]  and I don't know where it came from.
[01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.150]  But it's this thing that Gavin has
[01:29:05.150 --> 01:29:06.070]  on some people.
[01:29:06.250 --> 01:29:07.590]  And what I'm saying is
[01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:08.830]  Nick is going to get worse.
[01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:09.510]  Uh oh.
[01:29:10.890 --> 01:29:12.430]  I realized my weird fear.
[01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:13.970]  I'm happy.
[01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:15.150]  For the fear diagram?
[01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:15.610]  Yeah.
[01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:17.370]  I got one.
[01:29:17.690 --> 01:29:19.130]  I didn't consider this a fear,
[01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:19.650]  but I was like,
[01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.590]  it kind of aligns with Gavin's wet bread.
[01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:25.490]  I hate paper.
[01:29:26.010 --> 01:29:26.990]  Paper cups.
[01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:29.590]  Not a fan of paper cups.
[01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:30.630]  These things.
[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:33.650]  I'll send a photo right now.
[01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:35.050]  You know those triangle...
[01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:36.070]  Paper.
[01:29:37.690 --> 01:29:39.370]  You know those triangle paper cups?
[01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:44.850]  The thought of the texture on my lips
[01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:46.710]  gives me goosebumps.
[01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:48.390]  It gives you chills, right?
[01:29:48.710 --> 01:29:51.370]  It chills me all over.
[01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:52.550]  Yep, I have that too.
[01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:54.030]  It makes me so uncomfortable.
[01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:56.830]  Scratching of cardboard, same thing,
[01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:58.710]  but it's largely like paper texture.
[01:29:59.190 --> 01:30:00.030]  Don't like it.
[01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:00.630]  At all.
[01:30:03.110 --> 01:30:04.830]  Fear I don't have.
[01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:05.990]  A wet hand.
[01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:08.970]  A wet hand touching paper
[01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.370]  is like...
[01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:12.930]  Then I look...
[01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:14.890]  This.
[01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:17.610]  The thought of biting on paper
[01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:19.230]  and getting it stuck to my lips.
[01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:24.150]  It makes me feel so bad on the inside.
[01:30:24.570 --> 01:30:25.950]  It physically pains me.
[01:30:26.250 --> 01:30:28.370]  If we have a fear diagram, Andrew,
[01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:29.350]  and we overlap,
[01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:31.410]  our overlap is just this.
[01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:34.570]  It doesn't have anything to do
[01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:35.670]  with getting my blood pressure taken.
[01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:36.590]  This is such a...
[01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:37.550]  I hate this feeling.
[01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:39.270]  Your fear diagram is a straight line.
[01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:47.610]  I have an idea on how to grow our podcast organically.
[01:30:47.850 --> 01:30:50.050]  I wanted to pitch you guys real fast before we end.
[01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:51.770]  If you guys are okay with it.
[01:30:52.010 --> 01:30:52.410]  Of course.
[01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:54.450]  I hate that my brain imagined the podcast
[01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:55.770]  as a seed in a pot.
[01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.670]  Okay.
[01:30:56.970 --> 01:30:57.950]  I posted a photo.
[01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:00.770]  Geoff just posted a photo of Michael J. Fox,
[01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:02.310]  an autographed image.
[01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.110]  And it says, try the shakes.
[01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:07.710]  It's hanging in a restaurant somewhere.
[01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:11.510]  I recently was in Toledo, Ohio,
[01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:15.850]  and I ate at a place called fucking Tony Paco's, I think.
[01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:16.730]  It was like a hot dog restaurant,
[01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:17.890]  like a Polish hot dog restaurant.
[01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:19.310]  Or Hungarian, I think.
[01:31:19.770 --> 01:31:21.850]  But they were there on the map
[01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:24.970]  because they are, they have,
[01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:28.550]  they maintain the world's largest collection
[01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:32.110]  of celebrity autographed hot dog buns.
[01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:33.970]  Maybe we could break some kind of a record
[01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:35.330]  to be like the celebrity,
[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:36.050]  not that we're celebrities,
[01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:37.870]  but the podcast or the group
[01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:42.210]  with the most photos hanging in restaurants
[01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:42.690]  around the world.
[01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:47.390]  This is, I think, the most concerned I've been
[01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:48.750]  at the start of a Geoff idea
[01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:51.470]  to onboard by the end, I think I've ever been.
[01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:52.890]  What was your original concern?
[01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:55.090]  Oh, but I didn't,
[01:31:55.410 --> 01:31:57.850]  he posted a photo of Michael J. Fox
[01:31:57.850 --> 01:31:59.690]  that said, try the shakes on it.
[01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:02.470]  And I was worried what direction we were going in.
[01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:05.590]  I thought we ran the possibility
[01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:08.130]  of it being a very tasteless joke.
[01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:09.210]  Oh my God.
[01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:12.510]  I didn't even make the connection.
[01:32:13.630 --> 01:32:15.650]  My brain immediately went there
[01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:16.950]  and I went, what are we doing?
[01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:18.410]  I was immediately laughing at that
[01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:19.650]  because it's in different pen
[01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:21.010]  like someone else wrote it on.
[01:32:21.310 --> 01:32:23.870]  No, I literally just googled,
[01:32:24.450 --> 01:32:25.570]  here, I'll show you.
[01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:27.330]  I just, oh my God.
[01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:30.290]  I was terrified of like,
[01:32:30.450 --> 01:32:31.690]  what are you doing?
[01:32:31.690 --> 01:32:34.150]  I'm horrified now because that sounds terrible.
[01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:35.250]  No, no, no, look here.
[01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:38.330]  And then it became clear that that is not at all
[01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:39.570]  what you were trying to reference.
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:41.110]  Look at my...
[01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:42.390]  Okay, we're good.
[01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:42.970]  Jesus.
[01:32:43.230 --> 01:32:47.690]  I searched for celebrity autograph photo diner.
[01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.530]  And Michael J. Fox is the very first one.
[01:32:50.690 --> 01:32:51.770]  I just grabbed it because it was first.
[01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:52.390]  I had nothing to do with it.
[01:32:52.390 --> 01:32:54.230]  Geoff, I didn't make the connection either.
[01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.010]  I didn't, it didn't even,
[01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:57.630]  the joke didn't occur to me at all.
[01:32:57.630 --> 01:32:58.930]  Instantly looked at it and went,
[01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:00.370]  what are we doing?
[01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:01.690]  No, I had no idea.
[01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:03.010]  It must be generational or something
[01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.590]  because Eric and I didn't get there.
[01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:06.330]  Also, go to,
[01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:07.390]  yeah, thanks for listening.
[01:33:07.530 --> 01:33:08.030]  Go to regulate,
[01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:09.530]  fucking stupid.
[01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:11.030]  God damn it, Gavin.
[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:12.930]  You have to say it.
[01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.530]  You say it.
[01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:15.650]  It's the best domain I've ever registered in my life.
[01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:19.230]  Regulatrion.com
[01:33:19.810 --> 01:33:21.490]  Or just, yeah, go there.
[01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.990]  Or Patreon.
[01:33:22.770 --> 01:33:23.530]  Yeah, check out our Patreon.
[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.230]  Regulation.

[01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.750]  Bye.
[01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:29.130]  Love you.
