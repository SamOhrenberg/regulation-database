[00:00.000 --> 00:01.460]  Are you trying to keep it as one soft?
[00:02.040 --> 00:03.380]  Yeah, one long soft.
[00:03.440 --> 00:04.480]  One just big soft?
[00:05.180 --> 00:08.120]  I've never melon-bowled a bagel before.
[00:08.460 --> 00:10.100]  So now you've scooped it.
[00:11.000 --> 00:11.880]  Softs removed.
[00:12.240 --> 00:13.080]  Okay, those are yours.
[00:13.620 --> 00:14.580]  Alright, eat them up.
[00:15.180 --> 00:15.920]  There you go.
[00:17.920 --> 00:19.260]  Tastes like a...
[00:19.260 --> 00:20.340]  That's a four out of ten.
[00:20.360 --> 00:20.740]  Albert's here.
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.000]  It almost tastes like paint.
[00:25.420 --> 00:26.580]  Almost tastes like...
[00:26.580 --> 00:28.100]  You know like when you're huffing paint?
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.420]  It's kind of like what it tastes like.
[00:29.420 --> 00:30.200]  Where's the salt?
