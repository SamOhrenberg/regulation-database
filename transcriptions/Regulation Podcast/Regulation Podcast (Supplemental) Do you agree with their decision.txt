[00:00.000 --> 00:02.780]  Andrew, you have the second pick in the bat, not bat draft.
[00:02.940 --> 00:04.720]  This might be a little bit of a controversial pick.
[00:04.860 --> 00:05.360]  Oh, God.
[00:07.640 --> 00:08.900]  We're going right in.
[00:09.060 --> 00:10.800]  This is this might be a fight.
[00:11.120 --> 00:14.460]  I am going to take Lucille as my bat, not bat.
[00:14.700 --> 00:17.260]  Oh, I don't think that's you can't.
[00:17.300 --> 00:18.180]  He just picked baseball bat.
[00:18.580 --> 00:20.000]  I just picked baseball bat.
[00:20.140 --> 00:21.500]  It's not just a bat.
[00:21.520 --> 00:23.080]  It has barbed wire on it.
[00:23.220 --> 00:25.980]  I'm sorry, I guess it is a variation of a bat.
[00:25.980 --> 00:31.460]  But in the spirit of the coffee thing with Gavin and Nick.
[00:31.820 --> 00:32.640]  Tea with lemonade.
[00:33.960 --> 00:35.500]  How is this different?
[00:35.640 --> 00:38.960]  If there is a majority that is against it, I'm OK with it.
[00:39.000 --> 00:39.900]  I just want to float out there.
[00:40.020 --> 00:41.880]  I am against it. I'm for it.
[00:41.960 --> 00:43.060]  Why are you for it, though?
[00:43.280 --> 00:44.340]  Tea, not tea and coffee.
[00:44.740 --> 00:45.920]  OK, yeah, coffee.
[00:46.060 --> 00:47.340]  I mean, it's a specific.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.120]  It's a specific bat.
[00:49.460 --> 00:50.760]  It's different. I'm a no.
[00:51.000 --> 00:52.880]  Right. So there's two yeses, two noes.
[00:53.100 --> 00:53.360]  Gavin?
[00:53.880 --> 00:54.460]  It's a no for me.
[00:54.460 --> 00:57.060]  OK, back to the drawing board.
