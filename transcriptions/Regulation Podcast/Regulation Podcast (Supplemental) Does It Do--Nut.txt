[00:00.000 --> 00:07.080]  Okay, we are now going to create for you Gavin's idea, but I'm introing it for some reason.
[00:07.320 --> 00:12.760]  Gavin wanted to create a bagel that was made out of pineapple. We took it to the audience.
[00:12.860 --> 00:17.140]  There was some concern amongst the group about whether a pineapple could be a bagel or whether
[00:17.140 --> 00:20.580]  it was more of a donut. So we did a poll. It was determined by the audience that...
[00:20.580 --> 00:21.360]  Overwhelming.
[00:21.600 --> 00:22.040]  Overwhelming.
[00:22.060 --> 00:23.260]  What was the poll? What was the phrase?
[00:23.480 --> 00:29.160]  What is a bagel? Or what is a pineapple? Bagel or donut?
[00:29.460 --> 00:29.540]  Right.
[00:30.100 --> 00:31.060]  You guys ever use one of these?
[00:31.180 --> 00:33.840]  So there's a spiral like the thing.
[00:34.200 --> 00:35.160]  The pineapple tap?
[00:35.580 --> 00:35.780]  Yeah.
[00:37.160 --> 00:39.560]  So you just have this specifically for this?
[00:39.680 --> 00:40.560]  I like pineapple.
[00:41.400 --> 00:42.880]  Look at all that delicious pineapple juice.
[00:46.180 --> 00:47.140]  Holy dick.
[00:47.240 --> 00:47.680]  There you go.
[00:48.100 --> 00:49.160]  That's pretty impressive.
[00:49.700 --> 00:49.840]  Yeah.
[00:50.700 --> 00:51.420]  Look at this.
