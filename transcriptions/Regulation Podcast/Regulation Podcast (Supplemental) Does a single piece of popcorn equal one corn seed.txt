[00:00.000 --> 00:02.840]  On the topic of food, I had a morning thought that was food related.
[00:03.300 --> 00:04.960]  Where do popcorn seeds come from?
[00:06.420 --> 00:07.360]  Like a maze?
[00:08.080 --> 00:09.760]  What? What? I still don't know.
[00:09.840 --> 00:11.140]  What? What are you?
[00:12.520 --> 00:14.100]  What are you saying?
[00:14.400 --> 00:16.440]  You're not being honest with us right now.
[00:16.580 --> 00:18.640]  Help me! Help! What's happening?
[00:18.920 --> 00:24.520]  You're not being truthful when you say that to us right now.
[00:24.700 --> 00:26.460]  No, no, no. Let me let me fully explain this to you.
[00:26.640 --> 00:28.280]  Let me talk to you through my thought process.
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.900]  I had a stomachache yesterday.
[00:30.140 --> 00:33.300]  Is it related to the fact I ate like a one pound bag of popcorn?
[00:33.500 --> 00:34.820]  Who can say? I don't know.
[00:35.400 --> 00:38.900]  But I was thinking about how much popcorn I ate.
[00:39.040 --> 00:42.600]  And could I equate that to a single thing of corn on the cob?
[00:42.780 --> 00:45.180]  If I imagine each little, I don't even know what to call it.
[00:45.240 --> 00:48.280]  Nugget? Corn nugget? Kernel! Kernel? Kernel!
[00:48.540 --> 00:49.020]  OK.
[00:50.840 --> 00:53.340]  If I converted that kernel to kernel.
[00:54.800 --> 00:56.520]  How many kernels are in a cob?
[00:56.520 --> 00:58.920]  And then how many in relation, because you just don't have a number.
