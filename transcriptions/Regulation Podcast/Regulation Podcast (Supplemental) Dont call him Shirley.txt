[00:00.000 --> 00:01.820]  I want to get on these grenades. How do you do that? Why?
[00:02.280 --> 00:05.180]  You hold B, it brings up, guess what? A weapon wheel.
[00:05.700 --> 00:05.920]  Yeah.
[00:06.440 --> 00:07.980]  Um, wow, good, good throw.
[00:08.140 --> 00:10.120]  And then you select the grenade, and then you got to hold the button.
[00:12.660 --> 00:15.420]  I'm down to 34. I'm going to need to reload.
[00:15.740 --> 00:18.600]  I mean, surely you realize you're an idiot.
[00:19.280 --> 00:20.660]  Surely you realize you're an idiot.
[00:21.160 --> 00:22.380]  Oh, you charge it up.
[00:22.800 --> 00:23.160]  Yeah.
[00:23.760 --> 00:25.460]  Okay. Surely you realize you're an idiot.
