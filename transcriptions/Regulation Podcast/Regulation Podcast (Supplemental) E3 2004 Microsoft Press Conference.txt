[00:00.000 --> 00:03.460]  Hello and welcome to a regulation watch.
[00:03.560 --> 00:05.760]  Like, Nick, pause, hold your horses.
[00:06.180 --> 00:07.060]  Sorry. What's going on?
[00:07.100 --> 00:08.500]  I'm trying to watch Nick's stream.
[00:09.220 --> 00:11.960]  I know that Nick and Eric, you two are very familiar with time travel.
[00:12.120 --> 00:14.380]  I haven't done it nearly as much as you two.
[00:14.820 --> 00:17.160]  We are going back and Jeff doesn't even know what we're doing.
[00:17.440 --> 00:20.300]  We're going back to E3 2004.
[00:20.900 --> 00:22.940]  We're going to watch the Xbox conference.
[00:23.980 --> 00:25.520]  What, 20 years ago?
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.260]  It was 20 years ago today.
[00:27.780 --> 00:28.740]  Was anyone at this?
[00:29.180 --> 00:30.140]  That's what I was about to say.
[00:30.200 --> 00:30.740]  I feel like Jeff.
[00:30.740 --> 00:32.180]  Jeff, you had to be in this, right?
[00:33.820 --> 00:34.180]  Fuck.
[00:34.540 --> 00:37.240]  This is right before Halo 2 is revealed.
[00:38.020 --> 00:39.800]  I'm sure you will have some insights.
[00:40.060 --> 00:40.680]  I will have questions.
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.020]  Let me watch it and I'll see if it jogs a memory.
[00:43.220 --> 00:46.360]  I mean, I'm sure I've seen it either way, but maybe I've been
[00:46.360 --> 00:48.760]  I've been to a lot of these, but they all kind of blend together.
[00:49.440 --> 00:50.240]  I haven't seen this.
[00:50.320 --> 00:52.780]  Does anyone else think they have seen this outside of Jeff?
[00:53.120 --> 00:54.340]  I guarantee I've seen it.
[00:54.920 --> 00:55.900]  Maybe at some point.
[00:55.960 --> 00:57.380]  It's been a long ass time.
[00:58.060 --> 01:01.660]  Your idea was to show this to us, and you don't know if it's any good.
[01:02.100 --> 01:04.500]  Well, it's E3 2004.
[01:04.840 --> 01:05.240]  It is very good.
[01:05.240 --> 01:06.220]  Or if we've already seen it.
[01:06.820 --> 01:08.640]  Well, you think that answer like you.
[01:08.840 --> 01:10.620]  What are you talking about?
[01:10.680 --> 01:11.100]  I'm sold.
[01:11.200 --> 01:12.100]  What I'm talking about.
[01:12.320 --> 01:15.320]  Listen, I like going back and rewatching these old conferences
[01:16.140 --> 01:19.240]  because these are designed, especially this era of E3
[01:19.240 --> 01:23.220]  is designed all around like this game's going to change the world
[01:23.220 --> 01:24.840]  and ridiculous bullshit.
[01:24.840 --> 01:26.640]  And you watch it the time ago.
[01:26.740 --> 01:30.460]  I don't know about that, but now we do know, like definitively.
[01:30.700 --> 01:34.900]  So it's fun to watch these with context of like, oh, nobody played that.
[01:34.980 --> 01:36.480]  That was that was a terrible game.
[01:37.040 --> 01:38.900]  I am very excited to do this.
[01:39.380 --> 01:43.100]  I mean, up front, we know that this isn't the best conference.
[01:43.800 --> 01:47.680]  Why? Oh, because of the Xbox One reveal?
[01:48.200 --> 01:51.220]  No, because of developers, developers, developers.
[01:51.820 --> 01:53.380]  Oh, I would disagree.
[01:54.860 --> 01:57.840]  I think Mr. Caffeine is pretty up there.
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.260]  I put him at the top.
[01:59.860 --> 02:00.880]  The Pagle 2.
[02:01.160 --> 02:04.160]  Remember when they revealed Pagle 2 and he tried to sink his jump
[02:04.160 --> 02:05.500]  with a rainbow and he fucked it up?
[02:05.900 --> 02:09.540]  There's some gold in these bullshit press conferences.
[02:09.980 --> 02:11.440]  So let's go. Let's play.
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.320]  Let's start, Nick, to see the future of gaming.
[02:14.940 --> 02:17.560]  This is the last press conference before the 360.
[02:18.160 --> 02:20.080]  It's are you streaming it from a Game Boy?
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.040]  That's what it's 2004 for Gavin.
[02:25.780 --> 02:28.680]  Gavin, you don't remember it, but that's what the world looked like.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.600]  Let's see. Let's see what our best.
[02:30.820 --> 02:31.880]  We had SDI. Yeah.
[02:31.920 --> 02:32.800]  Bump it up to 360.
[02:33.060 --> 02:33.580]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:34.580 --> 02:35.160]  There you go.
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.220]  What's one time in Magic City?
[02:36.480 --> 02:38.520]  Is this fate?
[02:38.620 --> 02:39.320]  Oh, no, Shrek.
[02:40.140 --> 02:41.320]  It's Shrek. Yeah, turn it.
[02:41.340 --> 02:43.360]  This is before we knew each other, I guess.
[02:44.040 --> 02:44.740]  What year did we meet?
[02:44.820 --> 02:45.740]  There, I'll turn it over for you.
[02:46.020 --> 02:46.340]  2005?
[02:46.660 --> 02:48.040]  Well, I knew who you were.
[02:48.700 --> 02:51.200]  Right. But before we talked or like met on the floor.
[02:53.620 --> 02:55.820]  Is this an all star rip off?
[02:57.560 --> 02:58.900]  I think it may have been.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.100]  That's awesome.
[03:00.340 --> 03:03.180]  Can you imagine a modern gaming press conference
[03:03.180 --> 03:05.780]  where they lead with Shrek for their platform?
[03:06.420 --> 03:08.440]  I mean, that's this is the first thing, right?
[03:08.520 --> 03:10.080]  Like they're out the gate with this.
[03:10.520 --> 03:14.300]  It's Unreal Tournament than Shrek. Huge, huge property at the time.
[03:14.440 --> 03:14.820]  You got to remember.
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.040]  Yeah, I mean, this was 2004.
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.220]  Shrek was hot, baby.
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.160]  And also part of E3 was selling to like Toys R Us.
[03:23.800 --> 03:25.500]  So it makes sense to me.
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.940]  Oh, I guess I guess you're right.
[03:27.060 --> 03:28.380]  That's more of what this is.
[03:28.580 --> 03:32.260]  It wasn't so much like, hey, gamers, get stoked.
[03:32.460 --> 03:36.680]  It's like, hey, stores, buy these games, please.
[03:37.220 --> 03:42.040]  Yeah, E3 has never at any point in the history of E3 been for gamers.
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.260]  It's such a popular misconception.
[03:46.340 --> 03:48.580]  Uh, do you think this is online co-op?
[03:49.400 --> 03:50.340]  Do you think we can play this?
[03:51.760 --> 03:55.980]  I don't. I think if it has online co-op, there's no servers to run.
[03:57.860 --> 04:00.960]  We... has anybody here ever played this game?
[04:01.600 --> 04:02.780]  Not yet. I don't think I have.
[04:03.020 --> 04:04.140]  I played Shrek 2.
[04:05.780 --> 04:07.800]  When did Xbox Live get turned on?
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.900]  Oh, that's a... I can look it up.
[04:11.440 --> 04:12.360]  Yeah, let's look it up.
[04:12.360 --> 04:14.240]  Because I think I got Xbox Live.
[04:14.300 --> 04:15.360]  It's just weird that the audio got a lot quieter.
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.360]  Oh, yeah, I think Nick's doing some background teasing and jorking.
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.100]  And he's made the audio go away.
[04:21.660 --> 04:23.140]  I mean, we can all control our own.
[04:23.200 --> 04:24.380]  It was very loud before.
[04:25.940 --> 04:26.660]  It was?
[04:27.060 --> 04:27.640]  For me, it was.
[04:27.640 --> 04:28.900]  For me, it was like medium.
[04:29.540 --> 04:30.780]  Medium, at best.
[04:30.940 --> 04:33.100]  For me, it was blowing out my eardrums.
[04:33.140 --> 04:33.300]  Yeah.
[04:35.140 --> 04:36.840]  Nick, you and I have sensy ears.
[04:36.960 --> 04:37.600]  I think so.
[04:38.660 --> 04:39.860]  It is good to play together.
[04:40.340 --> 04:41.700]  I tell that to my wife all the time.
[04:41.700 --> 04:42.360]  Yeah.
[04:42.860 --> 04:43.980]  Oh, what's this?
[04:44.400 --> 04:45.000]  Prince of Persia.
[04:45.900 --> 04:46.820]  Felt like it.
[04:47.260 --> 04:49.020]  Or Tom Clancy.
[04:49.660 --> 04:50.140]  Black Hawk Down.
[04:50.660 --> 04:51.880]  This looks like a Graw game.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  Is this Black maybe?
[04:53.940 --> 04:54.160]  No, I'm right.
[04:54.580 --> 04:55.700]  No, it's...
[04:55.700 --> 04:57.720]  Crawl was for the 360, though, I think.
[04:58.080 --> 04:58.500]  DayZ?
[04:59.740 --> 05:00.860]  I think it might be Black.
[05:02.120 --> 05:04.160]  You remember Black, their whole thing was like...
[05:04.160 --> 05:04.320]  Oh, yeah.
[05:04.660 --> 05:05.340]  Real gunshots.
[05:05.960 --> 05:07.920]  Yep, Xbox Live launched in 2000.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.480]  Full Spectrum Warrior.
[05:10.900 --> 05:13.040]  I've never played this, but I do own it.
[05:13.080 --> 05:15.040]  What a strange title.
[05:18.740 --> 05:20.720]  Let's just think about their rotation.
[05:20.880 --> 05:27.240]  So we're gonna start with Unreal Tournament, and then we're gonna do Big Shrek Block, and then let's go with Realistic Warfare.
[05:27.940 --> 05:29.300]  While a war is happening.
[05:30.020 --> 05:34.180]  There's just so many limited Spectrum Warriors out there, we just need someone to play.
[05:37.040 --> 05:40.180]  It's one of those titles that sounds designed by Madlibs.
[05:40.720 --> 05:41.120]  Uh-huh.
[05:41.520 --> 05:45.720]  Yeah, was it like a weird translation or something, or was that the actual intended name?
[05:45.800 --> 05:49.660]  Do you think Full Spectrum was like Tom Clancy, where there's just a button like,
[05:49.880 --> 05:52.880]  Full Spectrum Cooking. Full Spectrum Racing.
[05:54.240 --> 05:55.540]  Full Spectrum Presents.
[05:56.500 --> 05:59.500]  I just don't think you could name... I don't think you could name it that anymore.
[05:59.900 --> 06:00.300]  I don't know.
[06:00.380 --> 06:03.420]  I think if a game came out now called Full Spectrum Warrior...
[06:03.420 --> 06:06.300]  It would be called, like, Active Gamer.
[06:06.440 --> 06:08.180]  Like, it's not good.
[06:12.340 --> 06:17.240]  You guys haven't joined us into Ratatouille yet, but when you load into Ratatouille, it says,
[06:17.380 --> 06:19.460]  You are an Active Gamer. Do you want to proceed?
[06:20.380 --> 06:22.280]  And it is ridiculous.
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.000]  It makes both of us nervous to be called an Active Gamer.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.380]  What does that mean?
[06:27.700 --> 06:28.500]  It sounds like a threat.
[06:29.660 --> 06:32.100]  I don't know, but I bet Fox News doesn't like it.
[06:33.420 --> 06:34.320]  Oh my God.
[06:35.600 --> 06:37.680]  Should we play all of these games?
[06:39.680 --> 06:42.180]  That sounds like... Gavin's no sounds like a yes to me.
[06:42.480 --> 06:45.280]  I own this on the Xbox One.
[06:45.620 --> 06:46.400]  Did you buy it?
[06:46.920 --> 06:49.900]  I did, because it was like $2, I think, if it's the same game.
[06:49.920 --> 06:50.800]  Yeah, how do you pass that up?
[06:51.000 --> 06:51.780]  Oh, it's Pandemic.
[06:51.880 --> 06:53.160]  I don't think that's cheap enough.
[06:54.620 --> 06:56.840]  Was there any gameplay there, or was it all cutscenes?
[06:57.300 --> 06:58.480]  Yeah, I was going to say...
[06:58.480 --> 06:59.900]  There might have been some, but not...
[06:59.900 --> 07:03.220]  $2 is what we were selling the Strangerhood for back in the day.
[07:03.420 --> 07:06.660]  You can either buy Full Spectrum Warrior or a Strangerhood DVD.
[07:07.480 --> 07:08.720]  Pick your poison.
[07:09.480 --> 07:09.800]  Whoa.
[07:10.280 --> 07:11.500]  Oh, what, Wolf?
[07:11.940 --> 07:14.920]  Full Spectrum Warrior got like 80% across the board.
[07:15.920 --> 07:16.400]  Surprising.
[07:17.420 --> 07:19.880]  I mean, it's only 80% of the Spectrum.
[07:21.080 --> 07:21.780]  It's true.
[07:22.380 --> 07:24.620]  I don't think I can name a Full Spectrum review game then.
[07:25.100 --> 07:26.420]  I've never heard of a 100%.
[07:27.280 --> 07:29.940]  Outside of this, where you feed your hunger.
[07:30.960 --> 07:32.940]  God, that is such a font of a name.
[07:32.940 --> 07:33.940]  Oh, hell yeah!
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.700]  For Total Destruction.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.920]  Oh, do you think they're going to give a URL?
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.080]  Do you think this is too early for URLs and ads?
[07:43.660 --> 07:44.340]  Oh, definitely.
[07:45.100 --> 07:46.060]  It's gotta be.
[07:46.600 --> 07:49.880]  Was MechaSoul the game with the big control panel?
[07:50.140 --> 07:51.820]  I remember that.
[07:54.640 --> 07:58.740]  I was going to say, a big Gustavo Sorolla game if I've ever seen one.
[07:59.560 --> 08:04.900]  I had a friend who had it, and I would always flip up the little plastic thing and eject him out of the mech.
[08:05.040 --> 08:06.100]  And he would get so mad.
[08:08.080 --> 08:09.120]  Are those Goombas?
[08:10.140 --> 08:10.980]  What are these?
[08:11.900 --> 08:13.460]  I thought they were like bunny heads.
[08:14.780 --> 08:16.500]  Isn't this Conker's Bad Fur Day?
[08:17.200 --> 08:18.540]  Oh, it might be.
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.580]  Or Conker's The Tomb or whatever the fuck.
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.240]  Oh, they're doing the Terminator thing with Conker?
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.120]  Yeah, it's Terminator.
[08:25.400 --> 08:27.260]  I think that's what this is, isn't it?
[08:27.260 --> 08:27.960]  That would make sense.
[08:27.960 --> 08:29.540]  James Cameron's Conker.
[08:29.540 --> 08:30.180]  Oh, it has to be.
[08:30.680 --> 08:33.500]  I never played any of these.
[08:35.040 --> 08:38.500]  Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the most drunk gamers.
[08:38.500 --> 08:41.060]  Like, it's fine by Nintendo 64 standard.
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.920]  A bit rude, a bit cheeky.
[08:44.040 --> 08:45.180]  That was the point of it.
[08:46.160 --> 08:49.580]  It was the first game we ever made content out of.
[08:49.820 --> 08:54.420]  It's really the very first video game I ever worked with in an entertainment way.
[08:54.660 --> 08:55.820]  That's so funny.
[08:57.780 --> 08:59.380]  Did you try to get it for review?
[09:00.920 --> 09:02.960]  No, I think we just did like...
[09:02.960 --> 09:06.580]  We got drunk and played it and reviewed it and did like an essay on it.
[09:06.660 --> 09:08.160]  That's what we used to do back in Conker days.
[09:08.320 --> 09:09.640]  I wish I could find an essay.
[09:10.440 --> 09:11.400]  I'd love to see your essay.
[09:12.020 --> 09:13.860]  Probably on the Internet Archive.
[09:14.080 --> 09:15.560]  I'll see. I'll see if I can find that.
[09:16.320 --> 09:19.000]  I don't think... this is the one that was like...
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.120]  I don't think I played this.
[09:21.380 --> 09:22.480]  The original Battle Royale?
[09:22.480 --> 09:25.800]  No, I think the charm of the first one wore off almost immediately.
[09:26.120 --> 09:29.240]  And so there was zero desire for a sequel.
[09:35.240 --> 09:40.220]  And it's just weird that a character from Diddy Kong Racing spun off into like that thing.
[09:40.340 --> 09:40.800]  You know what I mean?
[09:41.680 --> 09:43.820]  Rare made interesting choices back in the day.
[09:44.600 --> 09:47.020]  Do you ever remember Xbox's slogan being,
[09:47.220 --> 09:48.260]  It's good to play together?
[09:48.620 --> 09:51.020]  I have no awareness of that ever being a thing.
[09:51.020 --> 09:52.100]  I really don't.
[09:52.220 --> 09:54.180]  But that was like the whole point of Xbox Live.
[09:54.800 --> 09:56.420]  It's all Xbox Live stuff.
[09:56.420 --> 09:57.060]  It's Fable 1, eh?
[09:58.360 --> 10:00.040]  Is it Fable? This might be 2.
[10:02.080 --> 10:03.020]  Did Fable 1...
[10:03.800 --> 10:08.220]  I played Fable 3 and I absolutely hated it.
[10:08.440 --> 10:08.820]  Oh really?
[10:08.880 --> 10:09.220]  Really!
[10:09.880 --> 10:10.760]  Yeah, I'm with you on that.
[10:10.800 --> 10:13.820]  It's the worst one of my favorite franchises of all time.
[10:14.600 --> 10:14.820]  Really?
[10:14.960 --> 10:17.260]  Fable 1, 2, and 3 I absolutely love.
[10:18.160 --> 10:19.900]  3 is okay. 2 is amazing.
[10:20.620 --> 10:23.040]  3 really botches it at the end.
[10:23.340 --> 10:27.700]  It totally does. Millie just played through 3 again and I was watching her play it and I had so much fun just watching it.
[10:28.060 --> 10:28.640]  It's a charming game.
[10:28.640 --> 10:32.860]  That was the one where you could like go into each other's worlds, right? And mess shit up.
[10:34.280 --> 10:34.640]  Could...
[10:34.640 --> 10:37.840]  You could like play in someone else's file as like a co-op partner.
[10:38.600 --> 10:39.260]  I don't think so.
[10:39.340 --> 10:39.780]  I have no idea.
[10:40.540 --> 10:44.300]  Yes, you could play... there was co-op in Fable 3, but there was co-op in Fable 2 as well.
[10:44.420 --> 10:49.420]  Yeah, because I remember, I think I went into Dan's world and like started killing all the people in the town and he got really annoyed.
[10:50.540 --> 10:54.160]  I wasn't a great person to be around if you were playing a video game.
[10:55.020 --> 10:57.560]  Or, let's be honest, even if you're not playing a video game.
[10:58.360 --> 11:04.680]  Fable did a thing that Crackdown also did that I think more games should do where there's visual progress.
[11:05.320 --> 11:08.300]  Like the more good stuff you do in Fable, you'd gain a halo.
[11:08.820 --> 11:10.740]  And if you did villainous shit, you'd become a devil.
[11:10.760 --> 11:11.560]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[11:11.560 --> 11:16.640]  That's what I like about Mass Effect. I like my scars in my face getting worse.
[11:16.820 --> 11:17.820]  Yeah, it's another green.
[11:18.300 --> 11:18.480]  Evil.
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.700]  Fable has such amazing little side missions that you would just go off on and then suddenly you're in a haunted house and like...
[11:25.700 --> 11:26.020]  Yes.
[11:26.040 --> 11:26.880]  It was awesome.
[11:27.100 --> 11:29.280]  The doors with the... oh, there's a chest key.
[11:29.280 --> 11:30.200]  I'm excited for the next Fable.
[11:30.200 --> 11:30.560]  All that stuff.
[11:30.840 --> 11:31.260]  Yeah, me too.
[11:32.660 --> 11:33.540]  Chicken chaser!
[11:34.160 --> 11:34.400]  Oh!
[11:34.440 --> 11:37.360]  I even played the connect on rails Fable and that was terrible.
[11:37.700 --> 11:38.260]  Oh yeah.
[11:38.360 --> 11:38.680]  What is this?
[11:38.700 --> 11:39.580]  A clone trooper game.
[11:40.700 --> 11:42.380]  I don't remember this at all.
[11:42.380 --> 11:43.460]  Is this Rogue Warrior, maybe?
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.980]  No, I think it's just like... it's either a special unit name or it's called clone trooper or something like that.
[11:49.980 --> 11:51.380]  Is this full spectrum Star Wars?
[11:53.080 --> 11:54.740]  It's full spectrum Clone Wars.
[11:54.800 --> 11:55.180]  Yeah, probably.
[11:55.660 --> 11:56.660]  Full spectrum Clone Wars.
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.320]  I will say what's kind of impressive is we haven't heard a human speak yet.
[12:03.020 --> 12:04.940]  It's just been game, game, game, game.
[12:04.940 --> 12:06.920]  But like, this is what I prefer.
[12:07.580 --> 12:07.780]  Yeah.
[12:07.780 --> 12:09.640]  I would rather them be like this.
[12:10.020 --> 12:12.800]  It's like the conference is good, the games are bad.
[12:13.040 --> 12:15.080]  If we could just get a good conference with good games.
[12:16.240 --> 12:18.920]  But I enjoy the cringe of whenever the people try to speak.
[12:19.240 --> 12:20.100]  I think it's...
[12:20.100 --> 12:20.320]  I don't, I don't.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.460]  It is that pepper to the dish.
[12:23.920 --> 12:25.860]  That's how we get our over 9000s.
[12:25.920 --> 12:28.520]  If it wasn't for that we would have those amazing moments.
[12:30.940 --> 12:32.920]  Where would we get our maximum damage?
[12:33.260 --> 12:36.680]  We should review all the pretend on stage gaming.
[12:36.680 --> 12:38.680]  Oh yeah.
[12:39.540 --> 12:41.720]  Oh that's, oh Gavin that's such a good idea.
[12:42.060 --> 12:43.640]  Cause they are dark.
[12:44.180 --> 12:46.060]  It would break all the time.
[12:46.220 --> 12:53.320]  Like I remember there's a Gears of War documentary where Cliffy B started playing live and then his controller just wouldn't sync.
[12:53.600 --> 12:58.820]  So they had to immediately panic play pre-recorded video behind him of what was happening.
[12:59.280 --> 13:00.120]  And he just had to pretend.
[13:01.440 --> 13:04.740]  And there's always like three people playing co-op or something.
[13:04.840 --> 13:06.760]  And they always say stuff that no one would ever say.
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.840]  Coming up behind you.
[13:09.020 --> 13:10.560]  It's like why would I ever say that?
[13:10.680 --> 13:13.280]  I would shoot through you and I wouldn't say anything.
[13:13.640 --> 13:15.160]  Check your three o'clock.
[13:15.820 --> 13:17.260]  You know what we should do?
[13:17.640 --> 13:19.860]  Like I want to review those games.
[13:19.980 --> 13:21.000]  Like I think that's fun.
[13:21.180 --> 13:23.700]  We should try to make a trailer.
[13:24.200 --> 13:27.260]  Like the most Ubisoft feeling trailer for a game.
[13:27.260 --> 13:32.300]  Like without script, like without fully scripting it.
[13:32.460 --> 13:37.080]  Try to do the alright you flank around and I'll divert their fire.
[13:37.440 --> 13:40.360]  Like find those moments and just do it.
[13:40.480 --> 13:41.820]  I want to do that so bad.
[13:42.680 --> 13:45.500]  Great job everyone! We won the match!
[13:45.640 --> 13:47.940]  Yeah! Awesome! Let's play again!
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.920]  Way to go gamers.
[13:50.700 --> 13:52.980]  DarkSide47 coming up on the left flank.
[13:53.480 --> 13:55.420]  Like holy shit it's Jalad.
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.280]  I was going to say I think all of the games we just saw are backwards compatible outside of Shrek.
[14:04.560 --> 14:06.460]  I think I can still play those which is crazy.
[14:07.020 --> 14:09.320]  You got to love dressing your presenter in all black.
[14:09.860 --> 14:11.340]  A bald presenter in all black.
[14:11.560 --> 14:12.820]  And putting him in a black background.
[14:13.200 --> 14:15.000]  So he's just a floating head in hands.
[14:15.400 --> 14:18.060]  I will say this is before.
[14:18.580 --> 14:20.360]  And Jeff you can probably speak to this too.
[14:20.780 --> 14:26.960]  Everyone at all of these conferences would do jeans, t-shirt, blazer.
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.400]  The worst look in the world.
[14:31.920 --> 14:32.000]  Absolutely.
[14:32.520 --> 14:35.240]  I would rather have the guy dressed like this.
[14:35.780 --> 14:37.060]  Yeah, 100%.
[14:37.060 --> 14:40.080]  Whoever said the Scott Van Pelt reference on there, that was funny.
[14:40.240 --> 14:40.480]  Thank you.
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.700]  Also, you see the flash photography going off is crazy.
[14:46.140 --> 14:47.060]  That's awesome.
[14:47.680 --> 14:50.580]  That's a lot of 2 megapixel photos with flash being taken.
[14:51.760 --> 14:52.520]  What do you think of that?
[14:52.520 --> 14:54.240]  I'm going to add them all up and make one good photo later.
[14:54.240 --> 14:57.440]  Those are some pretty baggy pants for a press conference.
[14:57.720 --> 14:59.000]  Yeah, but welcome to the...
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  Xbox UI.
[15:01.420 --> 15:02.620]  I love that UI.
[15:03.360 --> 15:08.000]  It was like you had a nuclear facility.
[15:08.440 --> 15:09.940]  Whenever you do that for your Xbox.
[15:10.680 --> 15:15.060]  I didn't really understand what I was controlling, but it was nice on the eye.
[15:19.370 --> 15:21.550]  This is going to be a great PowerPoint presentation.
[15:25.690 --> 15:27.430]  The one guy in the audience...
[15:27.430 --> 15:28.950]  Yeah! Software!
[15:32.950 --> 15:36.530]  I like his interlaced hands when he moves them.
[15:37.050 --> 15:38.830]  Tell me about MS Paint!
[15:40.010 --> 15:41.870]  Now that you've shown that to me, I can't unsee it.
[15:49.390 --> 15:50.590]  What's going on?
[15:50.930 --> 15:51.890]  There's two of them.
[15:52.570 --> 15:54.710]  Why was there double talking?
[15:54.710 --> 15:55.510]  That was fucking weird.
[15:55.670 --> 15:57.830]  It couldn't have been technical problems.
[15:58.270 --> 15:59.190]  No, no, no.
[15:59.250 --> 16:00.390]  Not an E3 press conference.
[16:00.710 --> 16:03.350]  Nearly one million Xbox Live paid members.
[16:05.150 --> 16:06.170]  Wow, almost!
[16:07.010 --> 16:07.950]  We're almost there.
[16:10.690 --> 16:12.550]  How much was Xbox Live back then?
[16:13.410 --> 16:15.290]  I think it was $60 for a year.
[16:16.050 --> 16:17.010]  That's pretty good value.
[16:17.010 --> 16:22.690]  I couldn't tell you, I just got a bunch of free things from conventions and lived off those.
[16:23.190 --> 16:24.610]  You get the three months free.
[16:26.090 --> 16:30.210]  You know what's crazy?
[16:30.610 --> 16:36.150]  When Netflix got re-launched on the 360 as part of their press conference, it was free.
[16:36.490 --> 16:38.610]  It was a free service, the online streaming part of it.
[16:39.650 --> 16:42.210]  You know what else is crazy?
[16:43.050 --> 16:46.690]  This is like watching archival footage of World War II.
[16:46.950 --> 16:48.370]  It's so old, right?
[16:48.770 --> 16:51.690]  It's like, if you told me it was colorized, I'd half believe you.
[16:54.190 --> 16:56.490]  Rooster Teeth was one year old at this point.
[16:56.630 --> 16:57.990]  We were a business.
[16:58.190 --> 17:02.170]  I probably had already quit my day job or was just about to focus on it full time.
[17:02.370 --> 17:04.310]  This was a career, or beginning a career.
[17:04.690 --> 17:08.030]  This is what the world looked like when we started that stupid company.
[17:08.550 --> 17:10.830]  Were you in Buda already or still spare-bedrooming?
[17:11.510 --> 17:13.310]  We were spare-bedrooming in Buda.
[17:13.330 --> 17:15.610]  The Rock! He's friends with The Rock!
[17:16.450 --> 17:17.930]  He's also friends with the Jenny.
[17:22.690 --> 17:25.270]  I love these guy quips.
[17:27.690 --> 17:29.970]  Trivial pursuit unhinged.
[17:30.370 --> 17:33.410]  Poor Niter didn't know he was going to wake up and get shit on.
[17:33.550 --> 17:36.250]  Should we add Niter on Xbox Live and see what we get?
[17:36.250 --> 17:38.070]  I'm writing down all these names.
[17:38.970 --> 17:40.590]  The Rock? You're writing down The Rock?
[17:41.410 --> 17:42.870]  I bet this is going to sound great.
[17:43.750 --> 17:44.290]  The Jenny?
[17:45.090 --> 17:46.050]  Jenny McCarthy?
[17:47.730 --> 17:54.230]  Oh, this is 2004.
[17:55.350 --> 17:56.710]  What the hell?
[17:58.270 --> 17:59.390]  May 9th, huh?
[18:00.410 --> 18:01.850]  Is this a dating thing?
[18:02.350 --> 18:04.870]  Yeah, it sounded really suggestive, didn't it?
[18:04.990 --> 18:05.850]  It sounded like Loveline.
[18:06.990 --> 18:09.410]  Is he basically saying he's going to get some later?
[18:10.050 --> 18:15.550]  I think Microsoft hired Jenny McCarthy to imply that she's fucking this guy.
[18:16.070 --> 18:18.550]  She was at an E3 I was at one time.
[18:19.890 --> 18:25.370]  We walked in behind the scenes and walked by her and Bernie's jaw hit the ground and I had to go back and pick it up.
[18:29.950 --> 18:32.490]  Original Xbox Live pricing was $50 a year.
[18:33.070 --> 18:33.350]  Wow.
[18:34.070 --> 18:37.430]  You got three months free with a lot of games.
[18:37.730 --> 18:41.310]  I never had one of those green Xboxes there.
[18:41.370 --> 18:41.790]  Oh, yeah.
[18:42.830 --> 18:45.430]  I think we had one around the office, but I didn't personally own one.
[18:45.430 --> 18:48.750]  How much did Jenny McCarthy get paid to record?
[18:49.370 --> 18:50.390]  What is this?
[18:50.510 --> 18:51.850]  Oh, my God.
[18:52.730 --> 18:53.250]  No!
[18:54.430 --> 18:55.970]  I hate this.
[18:57.950 --> 18:59.810]  Did the Xbox have a camera?
[19:00.250 --> 19:00.950]  What is this?
[19:02.650 --> 19:04.770]  I don't remember this ever being a thing.
[19:05.090 --> 19:06.790]  Maybe this is a feature that never launched.
[19:07.430 --> 19:07.950]  Yeah.
[19:08.990 --> 19:10.630]  Yeah, I've never seen this before.
[19:11.930 --> 19:15.150]  Do you think she ever touched an Xbox controller ever again?
[19:15.910 --> 19:16.250]  No.
[19:16.750 --> 19:20.150]  New idea we have in development that never went anywhere beyond that.
[19:20.470 --> 19:32.710]  I think she was on that circuit of celebrities who would say yes to video game stuff because they needed to stay relevant and so they would pretend to be into gaming.
[19:32.930 --> 19:36.170]  I feel like she was at at least two or three E3s I went to.
[19:36.450 --> 19:37.470]  Oh, yeah. Definitely.
[19:37.470 --> 19:50.450]  I mean, this is at the time of Spike TV and that sort of extreme sports dude bro culture and she just is like a 90s hangover for that stuff.
[19:51.210 --> 19:53.870]  And this was just her wheelhouse.
[19:54.490 --> 19:57.630]  Jeff, is this where you took your bit from episode 100 from?
[19:57.970 --> 20:02.310]  Yeah, I'm embarrassed to say that Peter Molyneux broke the ground.
[20:02.590 --> 20:03.690]  That guy's not wearing a suit.
[20:07.030 --> 20:07.990]  I, uh...
[20:07.990 --> 20:10.690]  This was back when video games...
[20:12.030 --> 20:20.670]  The video game industry was so desperate for any celebrity to attach to because they were just clamoring for cool points and relevance.
[20:20.830 --> 20:27.130]  So, like, any celebrity that would say, like, I'm amenable to that, they'd be like, you're our champion.
[20:29.590 --> 20:31.930]  Like, Seth Green, we fucking bow to you.
[20:31.930 --> 20:36.210]  I think I was, like, the fifth person on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but okay.
[20:36.950 --> 20:38.770]  Send each other little tickles.
[20:40.510 --> 20:49.030]  I think video games... and it's not by, like, use of celebrity that celebrities are, like, more in this kind of stuff now.
[20:49.110 --> 20:52.610]  It's just by how ubiquitous gaming has sort of become.
[20:53.030 --> 20:58.250]  It's just, like, I don't know, you just get people who are famous who play video games now.
[20:58.250 --> 21:02.450]  Why was online interaction back then all about pokes and tickles?
[21:05.870 --> 21:11.790]  I will say, I feel like the Vision came in with 360, right? So they eventually got there.
[21:12.010 --> 21:13.870]  But they did not bring tickles with them.
[21:14.390 --> 21:16.570]  They left tickles in the past with the development phase.
[21:17.110 --> 21:20.030]  But you're right, Gavin, because that was, like, the Facebook stuff.
[21:20.210 --> 21:23.570]  Like, just after this, it was all poke your friends and stuff like that.
[21:23.570 --> 21:27.830]  I like that it just cut to a camera there where the mic was, like, on the camera.
[21:30.190 --> 21:32.050]  I know the audience is gonna jump down my throat.
[21:32.170 --> 21:34.490]  I just called Peter Moore Peter Molyneux. I just realized it.
[21:35.410 --> 21:36.890]  Self-correction. Thank you.
[21:38.050 --> 21:41.610]  I have people on the brain, and I haven't seen any...
[21:41.610 --> 21:43.470]  Dude, I'll get emails.
[21:43.810 --> 21:46.090]  Yeah, they're gamers. They're active gamers, Andrew.
[21:48.030 --> 21:50.750]  Point of clarification, that was Peter Moore getting the tattoo?
[21:50.750 --> 21:55.850]  Yes, I know. Different old, bald, white guy.
[22:00.710 --> 22:01.590]  Wow, Namco.
[22:02.690 --> 22:04.850]  I was trying to figure out what the sideways R was.
[22:06.510 --> 22:07.970]  I don't think I've ever seen that logo.
[22:10.370 --> 22:10.810]  Arcade.
[22:12.610 --> 22:15.550]  You know what's new in Innovative? Pac-Man.
[22:16.230 --> 22:17.630]  Let's give you some fuckin' Pac-Man.
[22:18.150 --> 22:19.750]  That's exactly what we're about to fuckin' see.
[22:19.750 --> 22:22.930]  This didn't come out on Xbox. The original did it?
[22:23.430 --> 22:24.530]  Wasn't Arcade on 360?
[22:25.190 --> 22:27.930]  They had a disc. It was a physical disc.
[22:30.150 --> 22:32.830]  For Xbox Live Arcade on the original Xbox?
[22:32.830 --> 22:37.910]  But they're using the term arcade like a classic arcade.
[22:38.330 --> 22:38.590]  Yeah.
[22:38.690 --> 22:42.030]  Right? They're not using it like new indie games.
[22:42.250 --> 22:46.010]  Dude, Hexic. I never got that frickin' achievement in Hexic HD
[22:46.010 --> 22:50.150]  to get the three black tiles to make a thingy happen.
[22:50.550 --> 22:51.310]  Remember that one?
[22:51.350 --> 22:52.450]  Sounds like you have a new thing to do.
[22:52.630 --> 22:56.130]  I remember some of those early arcade achievements were fuckin' brutal.
[22:56.810 --> 22:59.550]  I don't think you can even play Hexic anymore. I don't think it even exists.
[23:00.510 --> 23:02.010]  Yeah, I don't...
[23:02.770 --> 23:03.910]  Fading Frenzy was amazing.
[23:04.130 --> 23:05.650]  Fading Frenzy's awesome!
[23:05.890 --> 23:06.630]  Double Frenzy.
[23:08.890 --> 23:10.430]  He got bigger and bigger.
[23:10.830 --> 23:11.410]  Yeah, it was a great game.
[23:11.970 --> 23:16.630]  This is, as I said, the last conference before they do E3 reveals and all that.
[23:16.750 --> 23:19.330]  I feel like all these features just got pushed to the 360.
[23:20.010 --> 23:20.190]  Yeah.
[23:21.230 --> 23:22.250]  Look at him leaning.
[23:22.570 --> 23:26.390]  And this guy knew it. This guy knew none of this shit was coming to this console.
[23:27.970 --> 23:30.050]  We have some new ideas.
[23:35.850 --> 23:38.630]  It's annoying me that Controllers 1 and 3 are plugged in.
[23:39.410 --> 23:41.850]  Oh, wow. Oh, you fucking weird.
[23:42.310 --> 23:43.890]  Now I'm just looking at that.
[23:43.970 --> 23:45.350]  Why did you do that? Why?
[23:45.490 --> 23:46.590]  What sense does that make?
[23:47.290 --> 23:50.410]  This is the most PowerPoint-ass looking thing.
[23:51.310 --> 23:52.270]  Video chat.
[23:52.570 --> 23:54.690]  Dude, I bet it was made in PowerPoint.
[23:55.390 --> 23:57.710]  You hear they're bringing live alerts to the platform?
[23:58.830 --> 24:00.230]  Like, who is...
[24:01.130 --> 24:04.150]  It's so funny to me, the things that they promote on these.
[24:04.710 --> 24:08.250]  Also, somebody designed and built...
[24:08.250 --> 24:12.250]  And also a group of people approved and paid for that lectern thing he's standing on.
[24:12.310 --> 24:13.050]  Yes. Yes.
[24:13.590 --> 24:14.770]  Where's that lectern now?
[24:16.690 --> 24:17.210]  XBox.
[24:20.150 --> 24:22.590]  15 minutes after this conference, it was in a dumpster.
[24:24.770 --> 24:26.610]  They didn't want to ship it back.
[24:29.130 --> 24:29.650]  XNA.
[24:34.590 --> 24:36.310]  What is XNA?
[24:36.850 --> 24:38.910]  I'm not following what he's just talking about.
[24:39.010 --> 24:40.310]  I think it's PC games.
[24:41.570 --> 24:45.330]  I think it's being able to convert XBox games to PC.
[24:46.110 --> 24:47.710]  Wow, that took a long time after this.
[24:48.370 --> 24:53.370]  Well, no offense to XNA, but I don't think it caught on because I lived through it and I have no fucking memory.
[25:00.270 --> 25:01.530]  I have a problem.
[25:01.530 --> 25:04.230]  That didn't catch on like developers, developers.
[25:04.670 --> 25:06.130]  Software, software, software, software.
[25:17.030 --> 25:20.670]  What is this?
[25:22.850 --> 25:26.670]  Midnight Club? Need for Speed? What are we looking at here?
[25:31.530 --> 25:32.390]  Where's the real car?
[25:34.210 --> 25:35.530]  Oh boy, that's...
[25:36.230 --> 25:37.210]  Nick, now you're talking.
[25:38.070 --> 25:39.990]  That's an E3 presentation.
[25:40.390 --> 25:41.410]  Here's a car.
[25:41.530 --> 25:42.650]  Roll that shit on stage.
[25:43.530 --> 25:44.750]  What was your favorite car game?
[25:46.250 --> 25:46.770]  Burnout.
[25:46.770 --> 25:47.530]  Favorite car game?
[25:48.130 --> 25:49.950]  Burnout Revenge.
[25:50.450 --> 25:52.210]  Oh, I think so. That's probably it.
[25:52.630 --> 25:54.390]  I also loved Midtown Madness.
[25:55.610 --> 25:56.410]  Garfield Cart?
[26:03.150 --> 26:07.510]  So Microsoft XNA didn't launch until 2006. It was primarily for indie games.
[26:08.050 --> 26:11.690]  The way he keeps leaning is just bothering me.
[26:12.090 --> 26:14.010]  It should be casual. He's calm. He's relaxed.
[26:14.990 --> 26:19.310]  He made a deal with Jenny that every time he does that, he's thinking of her, so she knows.
[26:20.710 --> 26:22.030]  I thought he was just getting hit with the kids.
[26:24.290 --> 26:29.170]  28 dynamic light sources. I'm glad they put that figure up because...
[26:29.170 --> 26:32.870]  You can see how many light sources are with this game.
[26:35.250 --> 26:39.150]  I know you're going to preorder Halo 2, but can I convince you to preorder this instead?
[26:39.430 --> 26:40.970]  Have you heard about the light sources?
[26:41.390 --> 26:42.830]  I'm not seeing 28 here.
[26:45.430 --> 26:48.150]  Dude, that score is going way up for no reason.
[26:51.090 --> 26:53.850]  I'm actually going to play this game.
[26:54.250 --> 26:56.010]  This should be a game.
[26:56.230 --> 26:57.290]  This is the game I want to play.
[26:57.750 --> 26:58.970]  This is great.
[26:59.130 --> 27:02.390]  They were advertising BeamNG before it came out.
[27:02.650 --> 27:06.630]  I want to know how do you get the high score because he's at 1.5 million right here.
[27:06.710 --> 27:07.770]  Oh, 1.6. Wow.
[27:08.690 --> 27:09.890]  Oh my god.
[27:10.270 --> 27:12.430]  Damn. Is this a real song?
[27:14.170 --> 27:17.430]  God, imagine if they had these physics on the original Xbox.
[27:19.310 --> 27:21.130]  What? They did right there. What are you talking about?
[27:22.590 --> 27:24.090]  Yeah, it's in their XNA, Gavin.
[27:24.290 --> 27:24.510]  Yeah.
[27:24.510 --> 27:25.690]  Apologies.
[27:25.950 --> 27:27.810]  You just needed to get the XNA disc.
[27:30.290 --> 27:32.820]  Light sources were the TeraFlops of 2004.
[27:33.810 --> 27:35.990]  That's pretty good.
[27:40.810 --> 27:42.930]  Crash Bandicoot? That's what I thought.
[27:47.210 --> 27:48.670]  Crash Reloaded?
[27:48.930 --> 27:50.990]  I think Crash is the car crashing.
[27:51.450 --> 27:51.890]  Oh.
[27:53.850 --> 27:56.090]  I don't think it's Crash Bandicoot, guys.
[27:56.490 --> 27:59.550]  No, I'm trying to remember if there's a game called Crash Reloaded.
[28:01.810 --> 28:03.850]  Yeah, I think it came out like five years ago.
[28:04.650 --> 28:05.930]  What level of Halo is this?
[28:08.950 --> 28:10.250]  Looks like the end stage.
[28:12.450 --> 28:15.130]  I'm looking at the company that made this pseudo-interactive.
[28:15.910 --> 28:18.870]  Last game they made was 2006, Full Auto 2.
[28:20.030 --> 28:21.270]  This might be Full Auto.
[28:21.830 --> 28:25.090]  Did that game have realistic crashing?
[28:25.770 --> 28:27.090]  Did it have 28 lighting sources?
[28:30.190 --> 28:31.790]  They added a green car, guys.
[28:31.910 --> 28:33.790]  There's no wiki page for Crash.
[28:34.570 --> 28:36.850]  They're Microsoft XNA Demo, unfortunately.
[28:37.970 --> 28:39.210]  Uh-oh, head-on collision.
[28:39.530 --> 28:40.090]  Oh, yes.
[28:41.150 --> 28:43.530]  Where's the score? I need to know what the score is.
[28:44.390 --> 28:45.430]  Hell yeah!
[28:45.790 --> 28:46.250]  Shit.
[28:48.150 --> 28:50.630]  Man, green got smothered.
[28:51.590 --> 28:51.930]  Yeah.
[28:53.050 --> 28:55.090]  Oh, showing that it's the real engine.
[28:55.410 --> 28:56.590]  That's all 300 parts.
[28:58.510 --> 29:00.190]  Some pretty good camera work there.
[29:01.210 --> 29:01.330]  Oh!
[29:06.930 --> 29:07.810]  First take, huh?
[29:10.470 --> 29:12.590]  Well, they can only run the simulation once,
[29:12.670 --> 29:14.110]  so he just had to get it good, and he went,
[29:14.290 --> 29:14.810]  Oh, fuck, wrong one.
[29:14.950 --> 29:17.630]  Goddamn, now I understand why we got hired for all those commercial gigs.
[29:24.930 --> 29:27.130]  I really wish that this was a game we could play.
[29:28.090 --> 29:29.270]  I'd crash these cars.
[29:29.410 --> 29:31.170]  I would crash these cars all day.
[29:31.370 --> 29:31.710]  All day.
[29:32.350 --> 29:34.030]  What if the next Mario Kart had these physics?
[29:34.310 --> 29:35.790]  Looks like a Hot Wheels car on the front.
[29:36.090 --> 29:38.430]  Dude, Yoshi's fucking taking everyone to task.
[29:38.530 --> 29:39.170]  That'd be so sick.
[29:40.070 --> 29:41.370]  Bowser will survive everything.
[29:46.950 --> 29:49.990]  Dude, what a waste of eight minutes of a press conference.
[29:51.390 --> 29:52.470]  Has it only been eight minutes?
[29:52.470 --> 29:53.870]  First, we had a car hit a wall.
[29:53.870 --> 29:56.350]  Then we discovered we could have a car hit another car.
[29:56.450 --> 29:58.270]  Anyway, be excited about XNA.
[30:00.370 --> 30:01.490]  At one point, he said...
[30:01.490 --> 30:02.470]  He did that, and he said,
[30:02.670 --> 30:03.830]  That's a great demo.
[30:04.430 --> 30:05.950]  He also said,
[30:06.130 --> 30:07.590]  Oh, they added a green car here.
[30:08.490 --> 30:09.990]  I mean, that was cool for the time.
[30:10.570 --> 30:11.170]  What, the green car?
[30:11.310 --> 30:12.330]  Oh, for the time, yeah.
[30:12.610 --> 30:14.150]  Would've been cool if it was in any of the games.
[30:14.750 --> 30:14.930]  Yeah.
[30:17.210 --> 30:19.670]  It's like, here's a pre-rendered video we animated.
[30:20.470 --> 30:20.730]  Right.
[30:23.150 --> 30:23.610]  Uh...
[30:23.610 --> 30:24.730]  Reminds me of Dead Island.
[30:26.410 --> 30:29.910]  It's like, showing somebody heavy metal the cartoon and going,
[30:30.050 --> 30:31.530]  And next year you'll be able to play it.
[30:34.830 --> 30:35.290]  HD.
[30:38.450 --> 30:39.370]  What about online games?
[30:39.770 --> 30:40.570]  Yeah, what does that have to do with that?
[30:42.390 --> 30:44.830]  I hear you have a million online active gamers.
[30:47.910 --> 30:48.950]  That's the full spectrum.
[30:50.850 --> 30:51.290]  Warrior?
[30:55.190 --> 30:56.430]  I blocked him on Xbox.
[30:57.310 --> 30:58.710]  I don't get a lot of Warrior anymore.
[31:11.630 --> 31:14.410]  The audience not knowing how to react to that was very funny.
[31:14.610 --> 31:16.110]  Like, it kind of confused... yeah!
[31:19.330 --> 31:21.570]  Yeah, we're still going in on X and A.
[31:21.770 --> 31:22.430]  So what is X and A?
[31:22.970 --> 31:27.390]  Do you think anybody ever said the words X and A again after this press conference?
[31:27.710 --> 31:31.030]  Well, it lasted until 2015, when I read into it a little bit.
[31:31.350 --> 31:35.270]  But it was mainly intended for, like, hobbyists and, like, very indie games.
[31:35.710 --> 31:36.550]  Not for Vanguard?
[31:37.390 --> 31:38.810]  I don't know Vanguard anything.
[31:40.190 --> 31:44.830]  To get ready for the next generation of online gameplay on Windows.
[31:45.170 --> 31:49.250]  I think the only time anybody talked about X and A after this was people going,
[31:49.450 --> 31:51.110]  So what the fuck was X and A?
[31:51.450 --> 31:52.090]  That's it.
[31:52.510 --> 31:58.350]  I guess the only time anybody talked about X and A after this was right now.
[31:59.070 --> 31:59.530]  Yeah, really.
[31:59.870 --> 32:01.670]  They may have been read out at the trial.
[32:02.050 --> 32:04.930]  Dude, we might be the number one X and A podcast.
[32:07.150 --> 32:09.330]  Keeping X and A alive since 2017.
[32:11.490 --> 32:12.950]  Regulation X and A, wow.
[32:14.650 --> 32:16.050]  We'd like to announce our new partnership.
[32:18.030 --> 32:21.270]  Do you think they've let the trademark expire?
[32:22.030 --> 32:23.330]  Andrew, look it up!
[32:23.650 --> 32:24.190]  For X and A?
[32:24.670 --> 32:25.970]  Because we could get in on X and A.
[32:26.050 --> 32:26.590]  Yeah, we could.
[32:29.570 --> 32:31.050]  Have they listed a website or anything?
[32:31.790 --> 32:35.930]  No, I think you just have to look up to see if the trademark has elapsed.
[32:36.090 --> 32:39.210]  We could register it and then we could be the new Sierra Myst.
[32:48.190 --> 32:52.290]  X and A trademark from the Microsoft Corporation.
[32:54.730 --> 33:00.670]  Status date as of 2019 is still active, but that's 2019.
[33:00.670 --> 33:01.890]  That's a while ago.
[33:09.060 --> 33:10.460]  We're going into the Xbox!
[33:11.260 --> 33:12.600]  What if this was a trailer for The Sims?
[33:14.020 --> 33:15.960]  It would just zoom down to the plumb up.
[33:16.680 --> 33:19.320]  I think X and A is expired.
[33:19.740 --> 33:20.740]  The trademark expired.
[33:21.000 --> 33:21.620]  Go, go, go!
[33:21.660 --> 33:22.000]  Alright, let's get it.
[33:22.360 --> 33:22.840]  There you go.
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.160]  Sudeki?
[33:26.500 --> 33:27.540]  Oh, Toast Your Soul.
[33:28.820 --> 33:30.540]  Do I remember that game?
[33:31.420 --> 33:33.520]  It looks like... oh, Showdown Legends of Wrestling.
[33:34.160 --> 33:35.360]  What the fuck was that?
[33:37.840 --> 33:40.860]  I remember... I think Hulk's on the... Chronicles of Riddick was awesome.
[33:41.360 --> 33:42.580]  Skate for a Bunch of Day was a great game.
[33:43.240 --> 33:44.520]  Never played it.
[33:46.260 --> 33:48.160]  I haven't seen a single game that I've played yet.
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.220]  Is that Cruise in USA?
[33:50.620 --> 33:50.960]  Outrun.
[33:51.580 --> 33:52.300]  Oh, that's Outrun.
[33:52.560 --> 33:52.960]  Came out.
[33:53.180 --> 33:53.800]  What is this?
[33:54.040 --> 33:56.160]  Cameo. That game sucked.
[33:56.700 --> 33:57.440]  Didn't that come out on 360?
[33:57.700 --> 33:58.080]  It's a 360 launch game.
[33:58.420 --> 33:58.560]  Yeah.
[33:59.260 --> 33:59.800]  I guess it was.
[34:01.160 --> 34:01.500]  Harry!
[34:02.040 --> 34:03.380]  I played that game. That was a good game.
[34:05.380 --> 34:06.900]  I don't know if I played that one.
[34:07.060 --> 34:07.920]  Godzilla Save the Earth.
[34:08.020 --> 34:09.840]  Wow, Godzilla Save the Earth.
[34:10.080 --> 34:11.600]  Oh, Godzilla Save the Earth was awesome.
[34:12.240 --> 34:13.840]  Why didn't they make Godzilla games anymore?
[34:15.160 --> 34:15.580]  Whoa.
[34:17.020 --> 34:18.480]  They put him in Call of Duty?
[34:19.740 --> 34:20.640]  Yeah, he is in Call of Duty.
[34:22.360 --> 34:22.840]  ESPN.
[34:23.220 --> 34:25.380]  ESPN NFL 2005.
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.220]  What a transition.
[34:31.780 --> 34:32.580]  Oh, God.
[34:34.320 --> 34:35.120]  Just terrible.
[34:38.100 --> 34:38.500]  Spyro.
[34:38.640 --> 34:39.740]  I don't think I've played that one.
[34:40.380 --> 34:42.160]  Is that 3? 4?
[34:42.380 --> 34:44.820]  Is that a numbered Spyro or is that a side Spyro?
[34:45.520 --> 34:46.640]  I think that might be a side.
[34:46.940 --> 34:48.000]  I played all the numbered ones.
[34:48.580 --> 34:50.540]  I don't think I ever played Jade Empire but everybody loved it.
[34:51.260 --> 34:51.800]  Never played it.
[34:52.860 --> 34:53.480]  Never played that.
[34:53.620 --> 34:53.980]  Boring.
[34:54.260 --> 34:55.180]  I hate mech games.
[34:55.380 --> 34:56.000]  I wish they were good.
[34:57.000 --> 34:58.440]  Titanfall is the only one I've ever enjoyed.
[34:58.920 --> 34:59.720]  Titanfall rocks.
[35:00.760 --> 35:01.240]  Driver.
[35:01.620 --> 35:03.320]  Driver with a 3.
[35:03.960 --> 35:05.100]  I loved that game.
[35:05.160 --> 35:06.480]  It had a great replay system.
[35:06.680 --> 35:09.200]  Yeah, Drive3R had a really robust game.
[35:09.520 --> 35:10.440]  Holy God.
[35:10.620 --> 35:13.300]  Here's a game that looks like Andrew probably played, Shark Tale.
[35:14.020 --> 35:15.340]  I probably did.
[35:15.820 --> 35:16.680]  That's probably correct.
[35:21.500 --> 35:22.280]  Unreal Chess.
[35:22.280 --> 35:23.860]  I never got into the Unreal games.
[35:24.640 --> 35:25.500]  I played the original.
[35:26.340 --> 35:27.160]  I never played them on console.
[35:27.760 --> 35:28.840]  Yeah, I played the one on the PC.
[35:31.860 --> 35:33.040]  It was one of your favorite games, right, Andrew?
[35:34.700 --> 35:35.940]  Shrek 2 was good.
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.040]  Yeah, it was a callback to when you said that earlier in this video.
[35:40.940 --> 35:42.780]  I played the new Hot Wheels game.
[35:44.460 --> 35:47.620]  That's just a bunch of microtransactions in that one.
[35:48.240 --> 35:48.520]  Really?
[35:48.820 --> 35:49.200]  Oh, yeah.
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.080]  StarCraft Ghost.
[35:53.720 --> 35:56.080]  Dude, I can't wait to play StarCraft Ghost.
[35:56.260 --> 35:56.540]  No way.
[35:56.840 --> 35:57.600]  I can't fucking wait.
[35:58.800 --> 35:59.680]  Advent Rising.
[36:00.060 --> 36:00.500]  Dude, I remember.
[36:00.500 --> 36:01.020]  Wow.
[36:03.100 --> 36:03.540]  Battlefront.
[36:04.460 --> 36:04.640]  Dude.
[36:07.600 --> 36:08.380]  It's so cool.
[36:08.540 --> 36:10.220]  They relaunched it.
[36:10.320 --> 36:12.680]  You can buy it again, but you can't fucking play it.
[36:13.160 --> 36:16.540]  Well, we know who won the great Madden ESPN football tournament.
[36:20.220 --> 36:20.660]  PsyOps.
[36:20.940 --> 36:23.360]  The Mindgate Conspiracy.
[36:28.280 --> 36:30.220]  We're just not even giving it up for Conker anymore.
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.520]  Great game.
[36:34.740 --> 36:35.440]  Great game.
[36:35.780 --> 36:37.920]  I guess Ghost Recon was on original Xbox?
[36:38.640 --> 36:39.960]  Yeah, but Pearl was 360.
[36:40.640 --> 36:40.980]  Yeah.
[36:41.620 --> 36:42.100]  Oh.
[36:44.600 --> 36:45.080]  Juiced.
[36:45.380 --> 36:47.220]  Juiced is such a great name.
[36:47.760 --> 36:48.700]  That could be any game.
[36:49.200 --> 36:50.260]  Juiced could be about anything.
[36:51.180 --> 36:52.140]  Oh, my God.
[36:52.420 --> 36:53.160]  Oh, Lord.
[36:53.320 --> 36:53.340]  Wow.
[36:53.340 --> 36:55.120]  I don't think I played Men of Valor.
[36:57.520 --> 36:58.820]  Oh, I played that game.
[36:58.940 --> 36:59.680]  What a...
[36:59.680 --> 37:02.240]  It's an RPG, and it was such a pain in the ass.
[37:02.880 --> 37:03.640]  Turn-based.
[37:05.040 --> 37:05.380]  Ew.
[37:06.280 --> 37:08.380]  I don't know if I remember the specific...
[37:09.440 --> 37:10.080]  Rainbow Six.
[37:10.140 --> 37:12.900]  I never got into the Rainbow Six games until the Vegas.
[37:13.180 --> 37:13.380]  I love this game.
[37:14.160 --> 37:17.960]  I played them on PC and then on Vegas, and I missed the early consoles.
[37:18.780 --> 37:19.980]  Squarepants Movie, the game.
[37:20.680 --> 37:21.520]  I played this.
[37:21.700 --> 37:22.060]  That was good.
[37:23.100 --> 37:23.620]  Burnout 3.
[37:23.620 --> 37:24.040]  Burnout 3 was great.
[37:24.540 --> 37:26.860]  I don't think I played Burnout 3, but I loved Revenge.
[37:28.400 --> 37:29.660]  I think I loved Takedown.
[37:30.020 --> 37:31.080]  Oh, shit, Full Spectrum Warrior.
[37:31.220 --> 37:32.040]  Everybody loved that game.
[37:32.200 --> 37:32.320]  Yeah.
[37:32.660 --> 37:33.800]  Full Spectrum Warrior, baby.
[37:34.580 --> 37:36.020]  I remember it was the game with the best title.
[37:37.280 --> 37:38.000]  Boob Physics.
[37:38.140 --> 37:39.200]  I was gonna say Boob Physics.
[37:40.720 --> 37:42.540]  There's a Rocco Bote classic right there.
[37:43.840 --> 37:44.940]  Oh, Doom 3.
[37:45.100 --> 37:46.200]  Dude, Doom 3.
[37:46.900 --> 37:47.640]  That game scared the shit out of me.
[37:47.640 --> 37:51.060]  I tried playing it again not too long ago, like Doom 3, just seeing if it was...
[37:51.060 --> 37:52.280]  like worth whatever.
[37:52.700 --> 37:53.800]  It's so ugly.
[37:54.200 --> 37:55.640]  Because I wanted to play more Doom games.
[37:55.860 --> 37:57.180]  It's so... ugh.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.380]  It's like...
[37:58.380 --> 37:59.360]  It's no fun.
[37:59.460 --> 38:01.040]  It's the least Doom game.
[38:01.320 --> 38:01.740]  It is.
[38:02.200 --> 38:04.120]  I wonder if it's good to play together.
[38:04.280 --> 38:05.040]  It's still trademarked.
[38:08.500 --> 38:09.920]  Here he comes.
[38:10.200 --> 38:10.920]  Peter Molyneux.
[38:14.760 --> 38:16.260]  Peter dot more.
[38:18.160 --> 38:19.180]  Show off your tat.
[38:19.180 --> 38:20.000]  Yeah.
[38:26.360 --> 38:28.800]  This guy looks like he's cool, baby.
[38:29.320 --> 38:31.060]  I love they gave him the green background.
[38:31.160 --> 38:32.360]  They dropped the curtain for him.
[38:32.640 --> 38:32.780]  Yep.
[38:33.960 --> 38:35.300]  Had a very weird career.
[38:36.620 --> 38:37.100]  Peter Moore.
[38:37.720 --> 38:38.680]  All over the place.
[38:38.840 --> 38:39.640]  Worked at Adidas.
[38:40.240 --> 38:42.680]  He was the head of Sega during Dreamcast.
[38:44.460 --> 38:44.820]  Uh...
[38:44.820 --> 38:48.880]  Worked in games for a long time and then became the president of Liverpool FC.
[38:49.460 --> 38:50.900]  Oh my god, really?
[38:52.280 --> 38:52.720]  Is he still?
[38:53.380 --> 38:54.720]  No, he was there for a year.
[38:54.840 --> 38:56.820]  He may not have been the president, but he was like a high-ranking...
[38:57.440 --> 39:00.780]  He transitioned out of games to join Liverpool in a managerial role.
[39:01.420 --> 39:04.520]  Yeah, Gavin, he was born in Liverpool.
[39:06.380 --> 39:08.580]  He's the weirdest sounding scouser I've ever heard.
[39:08.580 --> 39:12.720]  I know there's one game on everybody's mind right now.
[39:12.720 --> 39:14.020]  He was originally a gym teacher.
[39:14.920 --> 39:15.900]  Tiny glasses.
[39:16.200 --> 39:18.420]  He's listed on Wikipedia as a businessman.
[39:19.040 --> 39:19.320]  Yeah.
[39:19.720 --> 39:22.000]  Those are tiny glasses. Those are...
[39:22.000 --> 39:22.740]  Oh, he most...
[39:22.740 --> 39:23.280]  So big.
[39:23.780 --> 39:26.760]  He most recently became a resident of Montecito, California.
[39:26.880 --> 39:27.060]  Oh!
[39:29.260 --> 39:33.700]  So you've been working on Red vs. Blue at this point, Halo 1, Geoff.
[39:34.380 --> 39:34.600]  Yes.
[39:34.600 --> 39:40.180]  Were you guys just locked into any news or footage related to Halo 2 at this time?
[39:40.180 --> 39:40.640]  100%.
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.680]  We were also going up to Microsoft pretty...
[39:44.680 --> 39:50.600]  At this point, I'd say pretty consistently and seeing early builds and getting the fuck around with it.
[39:51.180 --> 39:51.380]  Oh, wow.
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.620]  I guess insights into what they could do to make it easier to film and stuff.
[39:59.620 --> 40:05.940]  Which was all like, if there's time after making this amazing video game, we'll try to throw your dumb shit in.
[40:06.300 --> 40:07.080]  That's awesome.
[40:07.640 --> 40:09.940]  Gave us outsized importance or anything other than letting us in the door.
[40:10.400 --> 40:11.240]  They're wonderful.
[40:11.540 --> 40:12.800]  Is Joe Staten that tiny?
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.080]  I can't tell if the guy next to him is very big or if he's very small.
[40:17.560 --> 40:20.100]  No, Joe's a shorter dude.
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.580]  That is how everybody in that time dressed.
[40:25.800 --> 40:25.980]  Yeah.
[40:27.460 --> 40:34.960]  I feel like that button-up striped shirt was standard issue for guys who wore glasses.
[40:35.540 --> 40:36.420]  Alright, come on.
[40:36.540 --> 40:36.800]  Wow.
[40:37.340 --> 40:38.820]  I feel like that is crazy.
[40:39.080 --> 40:40.500]  Summer of 04-ing us right now.
[40:41.080 --> 40:42.280]  It's really happening right now.
[40:42.280 --> 40:43.040]  The next great year.
[40:44.640 --> 40:51.260]  It's so funny because Halo 2 is such a great game and it's such a, I don't know, important game in our history.
[40:51.260 --> 40:56.400]  But it was slightly harder to film in and I thought it didn't look as good as Halo 1.
[40:56.540 --> 40:57.200]  It was milky.
[40:57.460 --> 40:58.480]  It was milky.
[40:58.620 --> 41:01.820]  And so it was always so frustrating because I was only working in it.
[41:01.860 --> 41:03.880]  I wasn't playing it like I had played Halo 1.
[41:04.880 --> 41:07.080]  Are we gonna get some Breaking Benjamin drop here?
[41:07.580 --> 41:08.480]  I think we might.
[41:08.620 --> 41:09.300]  Oh shit.
[41:09.900 --> 41:11.380]  I was so happy when 3 came out.
[41:12.680 --> 41:18.020]  I remember in 2 at the beginning you would film with the sentinel beam as like the lowest down weapon.
[41:18.020 --> 41:24.040]  Yeah, and we also couldn't get emblems off of shoulders for like the first month or two.
[41:24.260 --> 41:28.800]  And so the first couple of episodes we tried to color match the emblems.
[41:29.800 --> 41:33.720]  I remember being really excited for Red vs. Blue to switch to Halo 2.
[41:34.220 --> 41:39.860]  And after like 3 episodes I was just kind of like, it's kind of minging to look at for a long time.
[41:40.700 --> 41:42.180]  It was kind of minging, you're right.
[41:42.360 --> 41:43.700]  But then Halo 3 was amazing.
[41:43.700 --> 41:48.040]  Halo 3 looked, and still to this day looks, shiny and gleaming.
[41:48.420 --> 41:48.500]  Love that.
[41:48.500 --> 41:50.440]  I think it's the best version.
[41:51.100 --> 41:52.240]  For filming it at least.
[41:52.480 --> 41:59.020]  Because it was the last Halo game before they started doing like dirt and rustic and like darker vibes.
[41:59.200 --> 42:01.260]  Like Halo Reach was all mucky looking again deliberately.
[42:01.580 --> 42:02.100]  Yeah.
[42:02.500 --> 42:04.660]  I think Halo 2 was mucky unintentionally.
[42:05.740 --> 42:09.260]  Was this game, did this game feel faster than all the other ones to you?
[42:09.260 --> 42:11.640]  Like the movement and everything? The controls?
[42:12.180 --> 42:18.020]  Or was that just me remembering it differently from Halo 3 than the original?
[42:18.340 --> 42:19.320]  I don't remember.
[42:19.800 --> 42:21.180]  I honestly don't remember.
[42:22.020 --> 42:24.820]  I remember filming on this beach a lot.
[42:28.030 --> 42:31.240]  Oh yeah, dual wielding and elites were like new.
[42:34.860 --> 42:35.880]  Terrible combo.
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.600]  The biggest reaction so far.
[42:38.600 --> 42:39.340]  Yeah.
[42:39.580 --> 42:41.920]  I mean like really cool to see.
[42:42.100 --> 42:43.760]  Well imagine if it was good guns.
[42:45.580 --> 42:47.260]  I wonder how they balanced that.
[42:47.260 --> 42:48.440]  No it isn't, he's lying.
[42:50.960 --> 42:51.520]  Bam.
[42:56.280 --> 42:58.040]  And start teabagging him.
[42:58.220 --> 42:58.420]  Yeah.
[42:59.140 --> 43:01.520]  And then send him a voicemail that he sucks.
[43:02.720 --> 43:04.380]  The original battle rifle though.
[43:05.340 --> 43:06.600]  Oh boarding was a thing too.
[43:06.760 --> 43:07.260]  Oh that's right.
[43:07.260 --> 43:07.800]  Oh yeah.
[43:10.920 --> 43:12.260]  Dude stand in front of me.
[43:12.440 --> 43:13.560]  Jenny keeps tickling me.
[43:13.640 --> 43:14.520]  I need to hop off here.
[43:15.280 --> 43:16.160]  My toes.
[43:16.660 --> 43:17.160]  My toes.
[43:20.420 --> 43:21.900]  That's called boosting.
[43:23.160 --> 43:27.960]  Had we already seen that trailer where it was from that level that never was in the game?
[43:28.460 --> 43:29.100]  Oh yeah.
[43:29.640 --> 43:30.540]  I think so.
[43:30.740 --> 43:32.280]  I don't think this is our first look at Halo.
[43:32.340 --> 43:32.620]  No.
[43:33.280 --> 43:36.520]  Because boarding and dual wielding was already shown in that video.
[43:36.520 --> 43:37.240]  Oh really?
[43:37.980 --> 43:41.660]  But all these weapons are much more like the final ones.
[43:41.860 --> 43:45.700]  And the ones from that stage they showed us initially were completely different SMGs.
[43:46.900 --> 43:50.220]  It's weird to see the battle rifle without the number on the back.
[43:51.520 --> 43:52.360]  Oh yeah you're right.
[43:59.260 --> 44:00.800]  Go to work with it.
[44:03.080 --> 44:04.740]  What? Really?
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.020]  Is it single shot zoomed?
[44:08.240 --> 44:11.680]  I don't remember that in the final build.
[44:15.660 --> 44:16.660]  I'm going to look that up.
[44:23.410 --> 44:26.930]  Oh that's Max from the guy that started Certain Affinity right?
[44:27.990 --> 44:28.830]  Oh really?
[44:29.770 --> 44:30.130]  I think so.
[44:32.650 --> 44:34.550]  That shield on the top right is different.
[44:35.250 --> 44:39.390]  Yeah they got rid of the single shot functionality by the time the game launched.
[44:39.390 --> 44:39.990]  That's interesting.
[44:40.210 --> 44:41.470]  Max Coberman I think.
[44:43.410 --> 44:44.950]  I had no idea that was ever a thing.
[44:46.030 --> 44:46.310]  No.
[44:46.770 --> 44:47.350]  That's wild.
[44:47.790 --> 44:49.890]  This also wasn't in the game, this rocket hog.
[44:50.510 --> 44:50.990]  Wasn't it?
[44:51.570 --> 44:52.550]  It was a Gauss hog wasn't it?
[44:53.210 --> 44:54.030]  Yeah I think it was.
[44:55.810 --> 44:56.690]  The Gauss.
[45:00.750 --> 45:05.030]  Yeah you couldn't destroy the vehicles in Halo 1 could you?
[45:05.590 --> 45:08.890]  You could destroy the covenant vehicles.
[45:09.390 --> 45:09.810]  Yeah.
[45:10.250 --> 45:11.530]  Could you in Halo 1?
[45:12.210 --> 45:12.590]  Yeah.
[45:13.370 --> 45:14.070]  I think so.
[45:14.130 --> 45:14.830]  In campaign you could.
[45:24.070 --> 45:25.590]  Never worked like that for me.
[45:25.770 --> 45:25.950]  Nope.
[45:37.340 --> 45:40.400]  Do you think he's playing or do you think this is a video?
[45:40.400 --> 45:40.480]  Yeah.
[45:40.980 --> 45:42.260]  And they're holding controls.
[45:46.060 --> 45:47.140]  I don't know.
[45:47.340 --> 45:48.120]  Maybe they're playing.
[45:49.620 --> 45:51.480]  Or maybe somebody's playing off camera.
[45:57.520 --> 46:00.460]  I don't even remember the health bar looking like that in the top right.
[46:00.460 --> 46:00.800]  Oh yeah.
[46:04.620 --> 46:05.760]  Oh he lived that time.
[46:05.760 --> 46:07.620]  Alright now bring it you alien bastard.
[46:11.200 --> 46:12.740]  Wow didn't lock that time.
[46:16.720 --> 46:19.540]  And wouldn't you know it I'm out of rockets for the most important thing.
[46:21.800 --> 46:25.460]  I like that this is the spot they chose to debut all this stuff on.
[46:25.600 --> 46:30.240]  I mean I get it's a big wide open space but it's not like the most gorgeous piece of Halo 2.
[46:31.020 --> 46:35.160]  And it's also not what I would associate with Halo whatsoever.
[46:35.160 --> 46:36.380]  You know what I mean?
[46:36.700 --> 46:40.660]  I kinda like this better than fake gameplay though.
[46:41.480 --> 46:42.240]  No for sure.
[46:43.920 --> 46:50.060]  Watching two guys fuck around with this is very interesting and I think if they did that now it would not be well received.
[46:50.620 --> 46:56.780]  It's like we've got two tan walls and a tan beach and then water that'll kill you if you look at it.
[46:57.800 --> 47:03.740]  And if you walk into this corner for 10 seconds and land here you'll super jump and fly out of the level.
[47:06.400 --> 47:09.940]  I think the sword launch ended up being the reason that full damage wasn't in the game.
[47:11.700 --> 47:16.000]  Because they couldn't figure out how to not kill you every time you launch.
[47:17.920 --> 47:21.780]  That's right that game had like the furthest launch I think in terms of the sword.
[47:26.120 --> 47:27.160]  Or I could be making that shit up.
[47:27.180 --> 47:29.820]  We had a lot of fun with that spinning blade.
[47:30.940 --> 47:35.880]  There was an issue with the PAL version of Halo 2 where if the bridge in front of the fan came down
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.460]  and someone was walking on it it would make a horrendous screeching sound.
[47:41.580 --> 47:44.320]  It used to do it when you'd knock the bridge down and it'd go like...
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.780]  But on the PAL version if you just walked on it it would just endlessly play that sound and it was so annoying.
[47:51.200 --> 47:53.760]  But it meant that I could always tell if someone was stood on it.
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.860]  This has to be the most cinematic view of Zanzibar right?
[47:58.940 --> 48:03.160]  Like I can't think of another scenario in which the camera would flow like this.
[48:03.160 --> 48:05.800]  I love the PC blue screen when the gate opens.
[48:11.360 --> 48:14.260]  This was a fun map for this game type though.
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.160]  It was a great asymmetric map.
[48:22.440 --> 48:26.420]  That stupid joke we made about that little corner up there, is this where Frohman was?
[48:27.100 --> 48:28.100]  Yeah, Camp Frohman.
[48:35.600 --> 48:39.500]  Was it 3 where they added the ability to go under that platform?
[48:41.400 --> 48:42.720]  Yeah, and there was a grav lift I think.
[48:42.960 --> 48:43.140]  Yeah.
[48:43.660 --> 48:45.560]  Or you could throw down a grav lift and go up.
[48:46.020 --> 48:46.980]  Oh, that's... yeah.
[48:47.520 --> 48:49.480]  This is the side of the map I never went to, ever.
[48:50.520 --> 48:54.480]  Was the Sausage King engraved in this version or was that in 3?
[48:55.400 --> 48:57.720]  The Abe Frohman thing on the right?
[48:59.420 --> 49:01.040]  The base where you could go under?
[49:02.260 --> 49:05.800]  Wasn't there a plaque on that that said Abe Frohman or the Sausage King?
[49:06.380 --> 49:07.560]  Like a Ferris Bueller reference?
[49:10.560 --> 49:15.360]  I want to load the MCC immediately after this and just loop through again.
[49:15.740 --> 49:18.180]  If that's all they show from Halo 2, that's insane.
[49:20.460 --> 49:20.800]  Such a fun game.
[49:20.800 --> 49:22.900]  Oh, they had to spend 80% of it on that fucking beach.
[49:24.320 --> 49:25.840]  It's like nothing from the campaign.
[49:31.220 --> 49:32.300]  That was no lie.
[49:34.640 --> 49:36.320]  Yeah, that game came in hot.
[49:36.580 --> 49:37.100]  Yeah, it did.
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.460]  They're both probably running back to the office to carry it home.
[49:44.300 --> 49:44.780]  Guaranteed.
[49:45.340 --> 49:46.540]  Yeah, 100%.
[49:46.540 --> 49:47.880]  They are on their way to a plane.
[49:51.820 --> 49:52.700]  No, that comes later.
[49:54.320 --> 49:55.400]  That's next generation.
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.060]  That word sure did change Jeff's life for a couple of years.
[50:07.580 --> 50:08.700]  Love it.
[50:18.220 --> 50:19.340]  Jesus Christ.
[50:29.420 --> 50:30.080]  Oh.
[50:36.620 --> 50:37.940]  Oh yeah?
[50:50.100 --> 50:52.300]  I don't remember this at all.
[50:52.400 --> 50:54.400]  You don't? Oh, I do.
[50:55.740 --> 50:56.680]  Oh my god.
[50:58.500 --> 50:58.800]  That...
[51:05.880 --> 51:08.000]  That looks so fucking dumb.
[51:08.420 --> 51:09.980]  Just do it as an 11.
[51:11.460 --> 51:12.000]  Yeah.
[51:12.440 --> 51:16.000]  No, write out the word November. It's gonna look so sick.
[51:18.980 --> 51:20.720]  Oh, I'd love it if they had the delay.
[51:21.140 --> 51:25.420]  That was such... I remember that being such a fucking joked about thing for so long.
[51:27.040 --> 51:28.560]  I'd forgotten that ever happened.
[51:30.100 --> 51:33.400]  That date was also bullshit for the rest of the world.
[51:34.600 --> 51:36.400]  It came out on the 11th for me.
[51:37.240 --> 51:38.540]  Blue Bulls for two days.
[51:39.940 --> 51:41.380]  Just gonna sit on your thumbs waiting?
[51:42.200 --> 51:43.940]  Yeah, thumb right up my arsehole waiting.
[51:50.880 --> 51:53.980]  What's the first video game you were excited to play?
[51:54.200 --> 51:54.620]  Do you remember?
[51:54.620 --> 51:59.500]  Like that you saw a commercial for or a preview for and were like, I gotta play that.
[52:00.940 --> 52:01.780]  Smash Brothers?
[52:02.060 --> 52:06.720]  I mean, I don't remember, but the one I was most excited for...
[52:06.720 --> 52:10.220]  It certainly wasn't the first, but the one I was most excited for was Star Fox 64.
[52:11.500 --> 52:13.180]  Mine was probably Mario 64.
[52:13.840 --> 52:17.680]  Yeah, I mean, I was like calling places to see if anyone caught it early.
[52:18.020 --> 52:20.400]  Like, I couldn't wait to play Star Fox 64.
[52:22.580 --> 52:26.820]  I couldn't play that game either because where I lived it was called Lylat Wars.
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.220]  Oh yeah, Lylat Wars. Stupid.
[52:30.220 --> 52:34.280]  I didn't even know it was like a Star Fox game until years later.
[52:35.920 --> 52:37.180]  That game was incredible.
[52:38.080 --> 52:43.020]  I think for me it was Phantasy Star on the Sega Master System.
[52:43.460 --> 52:45.360]  It had the coolest commercial.
[52:45.920 --> 52:50.240]  I mean, I had been playing games for a couple years at that point because I had an Atari 2600 and all,
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.420]  but I don't remember ever being like, Mom, I gotta go to the store and get this game until Phantasy Star came out.
[52:56.380 --> 52:59.740]  And I never got it because it was more expensive than regular games. It was like 80 bucks.
[53:03.430 --> 53:06.850]  Anyone here care about Dead or Alive or get into the series at any point?
[53:07.210 --> 53:07.510]  Nah.
[53:07.650 --> 53:11.070]  Do you know why 2 and 3 were pretty popular? Yeah, we played a lot of them.
[53:11.970 --> 53:12.330]  Oh yeah.
[53:13.350 --> 53:14.070]  Team Ninja.
[53:16.730 --> 53:21.970]  I remember this being everywhere. This was inescapable at this time.
[53:22.510 --> 53:32.750]  And I never played these games, but the advertisements for it, every magazine, every entertainment, anything in the mall,
[53:33.130 --> 53:38.150]  it just had Dead or Alive stuff everywhere. Blockbuster, everything had Dead or Alive.
[53:38.530 --> 53:41.150]  It was a very popular fighting game at the time.
[53:41.230 --> 53:41.990]  It was, yeah.
[53:41.990 --> 53:48.190]  I love the punch-landed sound effect of this era of these fighting games.
[53:50.810 --> 54:02.770]  These are, like this style of video game, of 3D fighter, is probably my least favorite genre of game ever.
[54:03.310 --> 54:11.350]  I love fighting games. I hate 3D, like Tekken, Virtua Fighter, Dead or Alive.
[54:11.350 --> 54:12.430]  I hate this shit.
[54:12.490 --> 54:13.470]  Oh really? Soul Calibur?
[54:13.810 --> 54:18.770]  It's so ugly. I don't like Soul Calibur. I don't like it. They're not fun to play.
[54:19.170 --> 54:25.530]  Like the 3D-ness of it is just like, okay, dodge, dodge, and now air juggle everything. I hated it.
[54:25.650 --> 54:31.090]  I thought Dead or Alive 3 was a pretty game, and you could kick people off mountains and through windows and stuff.
[54:32.090 --> 54:34.330]  Yeah, I like Soul Calibur 2. I thought it looked really nice.
[54:34.410 --> 54:35.450]  Yeah, Soul Calibur 2 was awesome.
[54:35.850 --> 54:36.730]  I like giraffes.
[54:40.830 --> 54:45.170]  Announcing here today, on the Xbox version of Dead or Alive, you can play as Simba.
[54:46.770 --> 54:53.950]  When we were working at the tech support center, where we, you know, kind of started Rooster Teeth,
[54:54.590 --> 54:58.710]  in the break room, it was Ready to Rumble and this game, Dead or Alive.
[54:59.410 --> 55:04.870]  And those were the two games, or Perfect Dark sometimes, but mostly it was Ready to Rumble and Dead or Alive
[55:04.870 --> 55:07.390]  were like the two games in concert rotation.
[55:09.410 --> 55:10.050]  Hell yeah!
[55:12.610 --> 55:13.710]  That's using your environment.
[55:15.570 --> 55:16.490]  They're about to show that you can do that.
[55:16.490 --> 55:17.150]  Oh, here we go.
[55:18.690 --> 55:20.150]  How long is this trailer?
[55:22.230 --> 55:23.730]  Well, we gotta fit all this stuff in there.
[55:25.330 --> 55:27.410]  Andrew, what'd you think of this movie? Did you watch this movie?
[55:28.790 --> 55:29.130]  No.
[55:29.470 --> 55:29.810]  No.
[55:29.930 --> 55:31.070]  Jamie Presley's in it, right?
[55:31.290 --> 55:31.430]  She is.
[55:31.430 --> 55:32.250]  I'm gonna show you, like, the name.
[55:32.990 --> 55:33.150]  Damn.
[55:33.150 --> 55:38.190]  I feel like this franchise died when they released that terrible beach volleyball game.
[55:38.190 --> 55:39.890]  I was about to say, remember when there was a beach volleyball?
[55:43.290 --> 55:48.090]  Don't they have, like, a bunch of those? There's a bunch of the beach volleyball games.
[55:48.770 --> 55:51.110]  The last Dead or Alive came out in 2019.
[55:52.590 --> 55:53.890]  Do you remember...
[55:53.890 --> 55:54.150]  Dead.
[55:55.210 --> 55:57.150]  Speaking of those, do you remember BMX XXX?
[55:58.670 --> 55:59.610]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[56:00.510 --> 56:02.570]  I did stuff on that with drunk cameras.
[56:03.150 --> 56:03.810]  Did you really?
[56:04.790 --> 56:07.030]  When you said I did stuff on that, I didn't know what you were asking.
[56:07.030 --> 56:07.870]  Yeah, I was a little worried.
[56:09.390 --> 56:11.330]  Yeah, we covered it for drunk cameras.
[56:11.610 --> 56:13.650]  That was back in that... I mean, that was the naughty one, right?
[56:13.690 --> 56:19.550]  But that was back in that era of Tony Hawk when there were so many clones that were all worth playing but not very good.
[56:19.630 --> 56:22.170]  Like Matt Hoffman and that one and...
[56:22.170 --> 56:22.790]  Dave Mehra.
[56:23.190 --> 56:23.690]  Dave Mehra.
[56:23.690 --> 56:24.270]  Aggressive in line.
[56:27.090 --> 56:28.570]  I loved Aggressive in line.
[56:29.790 --> 56:30.910]  Yeah, those are fun guys.
[56:30.910 --> 56:31.650]  They had a great soundtrack.
[56:35.270 --> 56:35.630]  Oh.
[56:35.730 --> 56:39.330]  Was Aggressive in line the one where the cop would chase you once the time ran out?
[56:39.330 --> 56:39.510]  Yeah.
[56:40.050 --> 56:40.910]  Yeah, that was great.
[56:48.390 --> 56:51.310]  You still think he has a weird accent?
[56:52.670 --> 56:53.030]  Gavin?
[56:53.330 --> 56:54.010]  Yeah, he does.
[56:54.170 --> 56:55.130]  Yeah, it's a little bit in between.
[56:55.130 --> 56:59.890]  This game has co-op play on Xbox Live. Bring on the pain!
[56:59.890 --> 57:03.170]  Do you think they're all wearing the same outfit and they just trade off behind screens?
[57:05.850 --> 57:09.990]  You think he's gonna end this by revealing the release date on his thigh for Doom 3?
[57:10.030 --> 57:11.710]  Yeah, I hope so. Roll those pants up, baby.
[57:13.510 --> 57:14.910]  That wasn't a real tattoo, right?
[57:15.710 --> 57:16.650]  No, I don't think so.
[57:18.230 --> 57:20.250]  I mean, I got it, so it's real to me.
[57:23.590 --> 57:25.170]  You're more tattooed.
[57:26.730 --> 57:30.830]  I got the date of Regulation Podcast debuting tattooed on my arm.
[57:32.850 --> 57:39.990]  It's crossed out because I couldn't keep track if it was like the 11th or the 12th or we're waiting until a Monday, so it just has a lot of lines through it.
[57:48.290 --> 57:49.230]  What is this?
[57:49.750 --> 57:50.810]  It's Doom 3, right?
[58:01.540 --> 58:04.300]  This game was so darkly lit.
[58:04.660 --> 58:06.700]  Yes. Yeah, that was like its whole thing.
[58:11.900 --> 58:19.980]  It's crazy, because you play like 1 and 2 and the offshoots and everything, and you're like, oh, these are pretty, you know, they're fun, whatever.
[58:20.140 --> 58:24.300]  And they're like, this one's gonna be fully 3D. And they went, oh, cool, is it gonna be fun? Absolutely not.
[58:24.440 --> 58:27.600]  It's gonna be a fucking slog to get through. You're not gonna enjoy yourself.
[58:28.200 --> 58:29.260]  You're not gonna see half of it.
[58:29.260 --> 58:32.800]  You can't see shit on your CRT TV.
[58:35.140 --> 58:40.900]  There is a lot of erasure for that right now online, where people are like, oh, Doom 3 is actually pretty good.
[58:41.200 --> 58:41.400]  What?
[58:41.780 --> 58:44.420]  No, it's absolutely fucking not. Yeah, it's crazy.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.760]  I never, I don't think I ever made it past like two hours of the game.
[58:49.340 --> 58:50.240]  No, I never did either.
[58:50.240 --> 58:50.680]  It's very fair.
[58:53.400 --> 58:58.160]  I'm like, I'm gonna give this thing such a fair shake, like I'm gonna try to like it.
[58:58.160 --> 58:59.220]  Oh, it's miserable.
[58:59.460 --> 58:59.920]  Yeah.
[58:59.920 --> 59:00.380]  It is no fun.
[59:00.780 --> 59:05.960]  Maybe a little over a year ago, I played through all the Dooms because I just hadn't played like the first three.
[59:06.740 --> 59:09.320]  And yeah, it is it is a slog for sure.
[59:10.640 --> 59:12.220]  DLC doesn't make it any better either.
[59:12.840 --> 59:18.140]  There was a DLC where you're in hell and you had to like fight through hell.
[59:18.860 --> 59:19.460]  D-Healthy.
[59:19.900 --> 59:20.620]  D-Healthy.
[59:23.400 --> 59:26.940]  Also due out this coming year is Jade Empire.
[59:26.940 --> 59:27.760]  Hmm.
[59:30.380 --> 59:34.400]  It was a good game. So untold. I never played it.
[59:38.440 --> 59:39.940]  Yeah, I never played Jade Empire.
[59:46.040 --> 59:48.720]  Peter Moore did the tattoo bit a second time.
[59:49.160 --> 59:49.480]  No!
[59:50.380 --> 59:50.560]  In 2006.
[59:50.900 --> 59:51.500]  Oh, God.
[59:51.880 --> 59:54.000]  Do you remember what that one was, Jeff?
[59:54.780 --> 59:56.680]  I'm sorry, say it again. He did the tattoo bit again.
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.380]  Peter Moore did the tattoo bit again for a second time with a different game in 2006.
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.120]  Do you remember what game that was?
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.680]  Gears of War.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.800]  It was not Gears of War. I kind of want us to watch the 2006 one just to get the full Peter Moore tattoo saga.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.060]  Was it a game that came out in 2006?
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:17.360]  Uh, let me see. Let me Google the game real quick.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:18.400]  Call of Duty.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.100]  That can't be. I looked it up before you said I want to watch this.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.240]  That can't be it. This looks like it was photoshopped.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.620]  It came out two years later.
[01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.610]  That is unbelievable.
[01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:49.950]  It looks like when you go to the fair and there's a guy that paints an animal on your face.
[01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:54.030]  It looks like that is his second iteration of the tattoo bit.
[01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.570]  Grand Theft Auto 4.
[01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:02.870]  Did he get it on the same arm?
[01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.690]  No.
[01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:05.210]  The other arm.
[01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.710]  It's the opposite arm.
[01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.210]  Oh my god, it looks like someone tip-exed it on him.
[01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:14.150]  It looks like somebody used MS Paint and went...
[01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.310]  It looks like skirting board paint.
[01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.950]  That's not good.
[01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.230]  That's awful.
[01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:38.550]  Loaded pipeline.
[01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:49.370]  They said nothing of Spider-Man 2, did they?
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:51.130]  Not yet, no.
[01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:51.630]  No!
[01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:54.470]  Look at that lineup.
[01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:55.230]  Spider-Man 2!
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:56.010]  Or Far Cry.
[01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.270]  Spider-Man!
[01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:59.650]  Spider-Man 2!
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:03.490]  Far Cry Instincts. That was like the drugged up one, wasn't it?
[01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:05.450]  I don't know.
[01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.170]  You know, like Feral and shit?
[01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:14.390]  I think so. And I think I only know that because I think Mega64 did a video for it.
[01:02:14.490 --> 01:02:16.670]  And it was like... not released.
[01:02:20.350 --> 01:02:21.690]  Was it too offensive?
[01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:26.010]  I think that's what that one was, but I don't remember.
[01:02:26.570 --> 01:02:30.490]  It was like doing drugs in a bathroom and drinking someone's piss.
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:34.170]  Yeah, it was like a lot. I think it was that one.
[01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:36.030]  I might be wrong, but I remember that.
[01:02:40.130 --> 01:02:43.710]  God, this is always the worst part of every presentation, is the Forza.
[01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:44.490]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:50.650]  There's something really funny about saying that the Xbox pipeline is loaded with good games
[01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:52.430]  and showing a graphic of Shrek 2.
[01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:59.750]  I also feel like, I just love that every console feels like Xbox had to have Forza
[01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:02.590]  and make a big deal out of it. It's our Gran Turismo competitor.
[01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:06.150]  And it's like, guys, nobody gives a shit about Gran Turismo either.
[01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:13.430]  I feel like those are huge games, but I was not in that world.
[01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:14.190]  There was a time.
[01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.550]  They are.
[01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.570]  I think they still are. I think people love those games.
[01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:22.150]  It's like when they show Just Dance and everyone goes,
[01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:24.550]  why the fuck are you showing nobody cares about this?
[01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:27.870]  And it's like, that is the thing that makes the company money.
[01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:32.770]  Yeah, but I don't think this trailer is where people that are going to play that game are going to see it.
[01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:33.450]  No.
[01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:34.670]  I disagree.
[01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:37.630]  Those people go to Walmart and they see the game and they buy it.
[01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:42.570]  I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that assessment.
[01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.350]  I do think that they're not watching the press conference,
[01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:49.730]  but I do think that they have to debut it on the big stage for investors,
[01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:51.410]  because this is where it makes sense.
[01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.550]  The biggest games of this time were racing and sports.
[01:03:58.230 --> 01:04:02.650]  Now it's Fortnite, which contains racing and sports as side games.
[01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:06.230]  And Guitar Hero. It contains Guitar Hero also.
[01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:13.130]  Did you see that they just enabled... they made the Rock Band 4 controllers compatible with modern Fortnite?
[01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:14.210]  Yep.
[01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.490]  That's crazy.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:25.580]  Use your V-Bucks to buy Creep.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.220]  I don't give a shit about this, but I know car people that love this one.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.260]  Dude, I've never met somebody who plays car games religiously like this.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.040]  Or who cares about Grand Theft Auto.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.560]  Is Trucks not a car game?
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.900]  Trucks is such a car game, dude.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.780]  Trucks is closer to GTA than fucking Forza.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:51.800]  What?
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.620]  It's doing missions. It's not about speed.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.200]  No!
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.620]  It's about traversing. It's about exploring.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.680]  Did you just say it's closer to GTA?
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.100]  Yeah, it feels more like a GTA game to me with non-car missions.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.280]  Delivery missions. It's fine.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.560]  Nothing like this.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.420]  Is there an airport in Trucks?
[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:12.700]  There's airports on some maps, yeah.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.320]  Also, we don't play Trucks anymore.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.120]  There's a new Trucks.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.360]  Is it Fish?
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.520]  No, it's Fallout 76.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.220]  Oh, you're playing that?
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.080]  We've been playing it non-stop.
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.240]  I wanna play that.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:31.360]  I'll play that with you.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.720]  Hop on in, dude. It's fucking awesome.
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:33.400]  I've never played it.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.840]  It's so good. It's so good.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:40.400]  I tried to play with Dan, and then it was like, we ended up just doing shit separately.
[01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:41.600]  And I was like, why are we playing together?
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.240]  That is my experience with Fallout 76.
[01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:45.900]  Come in and play. I came back in.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.220]  I had played it when it first came out, so it's like level 9.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.520]  So I'm just out of the vault.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.640]  And Burndog is like level 959.
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.940]  And so he just makes everything easy for you.
[01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:00.160]  It really helps. I'm about level 50 now.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.260]  I like the game. I like Fallout 76.
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:02.700]  It's a great game.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.680]  It's just like playing a Fallout game.
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.840]  There's more music and a different map, and you shoot the thing that moves, and it's great.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.720]  Oh, I need to fucking try it again.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.620]  And there's tons of story, too.
[01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:16.520]  Yeah, I remember I got it at launch, and I did not like it because there was...
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:17.360]  Oh, well, yeah, don't do that.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:17.900]  ...not a story or anything.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:19.180]  There were no NPCs or anything, right?
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.320]  No, there was nothing in the world.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:23.400]  Yeah, now it's like full of people and things and stuff.
[01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.500]  And like world events and like...
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:25.620]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:26.500]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.320]  Then you see the bat, and you go, ah, and you run away.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:30.620]  It's great.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.680]  Who is... why is this man...
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.680]  Dressed in all black like everybody else?
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680]  I mean, just...
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:46.740]  He's so different tonally from everyone else who's been up there doing this stuff.
[01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.350]  That's our goal, to be credible.
[01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:01.370]  You gotta start somewhere.
[01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:08.790]  Someone should go back through every E3 and see who told the most lies.
[01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:10.170]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:07:10.170 --> 01:07:10.990]  That's a great idea.
[01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.990]  I feel like Kotaku used to do that.
[01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.870]  Kotaku does that, yeah.
[01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:13.030]  Yeah.
[01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.510]  Right before every new press conference, they would go back and do a look back.
[01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:20.870]  Yeah, they would do like how much of what was said the previous year was delivered.
[01:07:21.450 --> 01:07:22.350]  Ah, that's interesting.
[01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:26.250]  It was always done very well.
[01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:27.090]  Yeah.
[01:07:27.530 --> 01:07:28.210]  It was a good feature.
[01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.910]  I know it's time to change the game.
[01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:33.410]  We've proven we can play.
[01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:36.030]  Now we're proving we can lead.
[01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:41.110]  And our leadership plan starts with delivering breakthrough games for the platform.
[01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:43.330]  Ambitious titles that capture...
[01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:47.070]  Remember for the 360, the one where they're like, we've established we can play.
[01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:48.930]  Now we're gonna establish TV.
[01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:51.550]  And everyone loved it.
[01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:53.330]  Can't get enough, baby.
[01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.870]  We'll focus in on delivering titles on an epic scale like Halo 2.
[01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:57.350]  We're gonna establish you can Skype.
[01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:07.410]  I've got a video somewhere of us all in the Achievement Hunter office at 636 watching the Xbox One announcement.
[01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:08.410]  Oh, really?
[01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.230]  Yeah, and we're all like, oh, Xbox One. Weird.
[01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:15.610]  We should commentate over that video.
[01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:16.910]  That's a great idea.
[01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:24.590]  That was true at the time.
[01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:28.510]  That's a good question.
[01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:29.630]  Connect!
[01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.390]  Software, software, software.
[01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:35.390]  That's what that other guy said.
[01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:40.590]  When was PlayStation Online a thing?
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.530]  Well, I don't know.
[01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:46.030]  Did the PS2 have it?
[01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:47.690]  I think it did.
[01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:53.810]  In March 2006, Sony officially introduced its unified online service.
[01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:54.290]  Oh, wow.
[01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:57.370]  You said 2006?
[01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.250]  Yeah, that's when they announced it.
[01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:05.230]  Sony launched its optimal premium service on top of the free PN2010.
[01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:08.150]  So it was right at that time, a little bit later.
[01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:16.310]  Yeah, the PlayStation is my single player game system.
[01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:18.790]  And then Xbox is my multiplayer.
[01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:22.610]  Even to this day, I've never played anything online on PlayStation.
[01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:25.350]  Like God of War or Horizon.
[01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:28.430]  You've never played Gran Turismo online on the PlayStation?
[01:09:28.830 --> 01:09:29.190]  That's wild.
[01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.210]  No. Should we play?
[01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:34.630]  I hear it's nothing like GTA.
[01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:37.950]  I heard the...
[01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:40.450]  Dude, Trucks to me is not a car game.
[01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:41.950]  It is such a car game.
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.590]  It is the most enthusiastic car game.
[01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:48.430]  It is just a winching, problem-solving game.
[01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:49.670]  The wilderness game.
[01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:52.960]  It's just an exploration and solving...
[01:09:53.530 --> 01:09:55.130]  Creating and solving problems game.
[01:09:55.450 --> 01:09:57.750]  Creating and solving problems.
[01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:59.370]  It's like alcohol.
[01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:06.130]  Teevo, AOL and AGO.
[01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.130]  Guys, we are aiming to be the next AOL.
[01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.690]  God, I was so all in on Teevo, man.
[01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.350]  I had the lifetime subscription.
[01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.090]  I was fucking...
[01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:19.630]  That was the future.
[01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.250]  You had the lifetime subscription?
[01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:23.990]  I did. I bought like the $300 lifetime subscription or whatever.
[01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:24.970]  I thought I would suffer.
[01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.790]  Ever.
[01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.570]  And then like two years later, I was like,
[01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.150]  What the fuck am I supposed to do with this thing?
[01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:31.590]  Could you still use it anywhere now?
[01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:33.390]  I don't know.
[01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.570]  I mean, if I had the box, I probably still could.
[01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.450]  What are you gonna watch?
[01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.210]  Like what TV hooks up you watch everything online?
[01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:42.770]  I'd watch all the shows that were saved to that box.
[01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:43.730]  Okay.
[01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:47.690]  Check it out, first two seasons of Lost, guys.
[01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:49.050]  Making the band.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.140]  Could you plug in like a fire stick to it now?
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.440]  Oh God, I don't know, man.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.420]  I don't even remember what kind of ports that thing had.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.600]  That was back in like...
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.640]  This era, right?
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:09.780]  Oh yeah.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.060]  I had a Teevo before...
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.060]  What did Teevo come out?
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.460]  I think I had a Teevo before Rooster Teevo.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:15.880]  Oh shit.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.560]  Yeah, this part of the presentation feels definitely not aimed at any gamers.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:22.260]  No!
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.800]  Hey investors, please, please.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.040]  Money, please, please.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:26.600]  Money, please.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:27.720]  We're real.
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.900]  It's not for like people that play games,
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.880]  but I feel like this is the shit that fuels the console war side of gamers.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.360]  Like they love...
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:43.540]  Oh yes.
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:47.120]  You fucking see that we got more subscribers than HBO?
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.640]  So it's the same, Andrew, as professional wrestling fans now,
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.400]  where they don't watch any of the wrestling,
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.880]  they look at ratings breakdowns and minute-by-minute demographic reports.
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:00.880]  Is that true?
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.540]  And you just go, you are psychopaths.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:04.820]  You are psychopaths.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.380]  What?
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.440]  I can't fucking believe he gave this press conference four stars.
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.320]  This is a five-star press conference.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.000]  That is legitimately what it is.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.740]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:15.440]  It's the worst.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.280]  What's the joy in that?
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.540]  There's no joy in any of it.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.320]  It's the worst. I hate it.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.360]  Coming from the guy that read episodes of Lost on Wikipedia.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.720]  Yeah, but I read...
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.460]  You know why I did that?
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.540]  Because I didn't enjoy the show anymore, and I just wanted to know how it ended.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:30.380]  That's true.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:33.280]  I guess you were reading the story and not looking at how many people watched it.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.480]  I didn't give a shit how many people watched it.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.080]  I cared about how often one person watched it, and that was me.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.200]  And I don't want to watch it anymore.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.900]  But I wanted to know how it ended.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:43.680]  What the?
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.600]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.240]  Oh!
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.180]  It's in the game.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:51.600]  Ray Lewis is going to come out and murder a police station.
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:52.580]  I was about to say.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:52.960]  Allegedly.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:53.640]  Allegedly.
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.780]  Was this before or after that?
[01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:00.550]  Not for long, you nut.
[01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:03.590]  It's just like the worst aging sports segment.
[01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.610]  That was Tony Parker.
[01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:06.570]  Tiger Woods would never cheat on this platform.
[01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.790]  Oh!
[01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:16.990]  That's the thumbnail.
[01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:19.090]  Crazy.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:25.880]  What?
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.100]  Did he say fucked up?
[01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:28.540]  No, he said bucked up.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:28.960]  Oh, okay.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:29.460]  Oh.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:30.280]  Oh.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:34.020]  It's in the game.
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:34.580]  Oh, sorry.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:37.420]  That was just really dumb.
[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.460]  This is probably my favorite era of EA Sports.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:40.840]  Wow.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:42.580]  Oh, my.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:43.500]  Oh, shit.
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.680]  Oh, my God.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.360]  What?
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.640]  Oh, no.
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:54.380]  Ali!
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.000]  Is that Muhammad Ali?
[01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.660]  Holy shit.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.640]  They didn't even announce Muhammad Ali?
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.580]  What's going on here?
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.040]  They just shook hands in front of Muhammad Ali.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.780]  Why does he look scared?
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.440]  Is that Carmelo Anthony?
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.100]  Wait, what the fuck?
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:21.980]  Landon Donovan?
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:28.060]  These are the biggest sports... this is crazy.
[01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:34.040]  There's probably a hundred million dollars worth of appearance fee on stage right now.
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:34.400]  Wow.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.560]  Amika Okafor.
[01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.540]  Amika Okafor, huh?
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.380]  Wow.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.980]  Highlights of his career.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.060]  Larry Fitzgerald looks so young.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:45.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.200]  No way.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:48.240]  That's crazy.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.260]  I like putting that.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.360]  I like the look of putting the...
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.360]  Marcus Naslin!
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:53.480]  Holy shit.
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.760]  I love Marcus Naslin.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.580]  He's the only person who knows who that is.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:57.860]  Yeah.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.460]  The rest of them are like, hey, a hockey player.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:00.160]  Holy fuck.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.880]  Carmelo fucking Anthony.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:06.900]  Crazy, man.
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.540]  Look at how young he is.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.680]  He played for the Nuggets still.
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:09.760]  Yeah, really young.
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:10.920]  Yep.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.280]  NFL football, Marshall Falk.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.200]  Is that Marshall Falk?
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.220]  LSU's finest, baby.
[01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.620]  Wow.
[01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:24.710]  Representing Fight Night, the greatest of all time.
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:25.930]  That's crazy.
[01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:31.710]  Also, they didn't have a baseball game?
[01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:31.890]  Yeah.
[01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:34.450]  No, I think there was a licensing issue.
[01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:36.730]  2K had baseball maybe at the time.
[01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:37.930]  Wow.
[01:15:38.050 --> 01:15:38.770]  Man, he was in rough shape.
[01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.750]  Yeah.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.480]  Everybody on that stage is lucky to be there with him.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.380]  It's fucking crazy.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:48.840]  Yep.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:50.100]  That's awesome.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:52.660]  I feel like they should have brought him out separately.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:53.820]  Yeah.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:56.580]  Like...
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:59.260]  Instead of having him stand on camera for the whole first part.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.220]  It's funny.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:04.860]  It's funny.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.680]  That's how respected and loved and famous that man is.
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.460]  He's on stage with Carmelo, Anthony, and Marshall Falk, and you're like, who are these losers?
[01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:13.300]  Yep.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.800]  Don't take it out on me.
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:20.320]  Oh.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.220]  Pan away from mom.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:22.920]  Come on.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:28.400]  What a weird fact that Muhammad Ali was on stage when they revealed GoldenEye Rogue Agent.
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.660]  GoldenEye Rogue Agent?
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:32.280]  How much do you think each one of those guys got paid to be on that stage?
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.780]  Oh, God.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.880]  Do you think any of the guys on stage ever played GoldenEye Rogue Agent?
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:43.600]  Carmelo, Anthony has played Carmelo. He's played it.
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.040]  He played Rogue Agent.
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.500]  Maybe, maybe Larry Fitzgerald.
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.480]  Look at those fucking pants Carmelo has on.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:54.660]  That's great, man.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.360]  It's that 04 Draft Glass type look, you know?
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:58.780]  Oh, with the giant suits.
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.220]  Boxing boys.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:16:59.780]  Yep.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.560]  The long suits.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.060]  All the athletes.
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.140]  Thank you, athletes.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.460]  I kind of wish they kept doing that.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.140]  Good guy, Marshall Fox.
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:17.720]  I like seeing...
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.360]  Good guy, Marshall Fox.
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:19.680]  Yeah.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:21.760]  Helping the champ.
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.660]  It was a cool snapshot of, like, the relevant athletes of that time.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:26.660]  At that time, yeah.
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:35.720]  You know that moment cost them $3 million in appearance fees.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:37.840]  Crazy.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.360]  And that's all they did, is just had them stand there in their jerseys.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:48.560]  Oh my god.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:54.860]  This rocks.
[01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:59.320]  And also, using a song like this is the most 2004 thing you could do.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.880]  Some block rock and beats type bullshit.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:03.600]  This is great.
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:12.200]  I remember renting Rogue Agent, not knowing the premise of it, and being so mad that James Bond dies in the first mission.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.420]  I was like, this is some bullshit.
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:16.140]  What is the premise of it?
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.060]  It's James Bond... you kill James Bond in the first mission, and then you play as the villain for the rest of the game.
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.360]  Oh. I never played that one.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:31.120]  And I was not about that life at all. I hated it. I stopped playing after the... I returned it.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.260]  Was James Bond fully dead? Like, he didn't come back to life in the last...
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.140]  Well, I don't know. I never played past the first level.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.580]  Are you sure it wasn't like a you only live twice situation?
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.500]  By the third level, you find out that you're James Bond in disguise.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.580]  Time Splitters!
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.840]  Time Splitters!
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.320]  Fucking great game.
[01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:56.510]  I have so much love for Time Splitters, and I couldn't explain why. I don't think I could fully articulate why I like Time Splitters so much.
[01:18:56.790 --> 01:19:02.030]  Highly stylized, well-balanced maps, great multiplayer modes.
[01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:07.350]  There was a, like, bodyguard gameplay type that was some of the most fun I've ever played... I had in my entire life.
[01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:09.610]  It was just a fun multiplayer game. It was a fun shooter.
[01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:17.470]  Isn't it weird that a lot of classic, the most fun you've ever had multiplayer modes from old games never translated to the modern day?
[01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:21.290]  Yeah. Or to other games, even, sometimes, you know?
[01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:27.750]  We entered the game, we played the game at a high level, and now we're changing the game.
[01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:34.090]  We're taking a leadership position to put gaming on par with all forms of media entertainment.
[01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:37.570]  There's a changing of the guard in the industry.
[01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:44.530]  This is such as, like, he's reading him the riot act. Like, he's giving him, like,
[01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:48.290]  Sony, pay attention, ladies and gentlemen, we are here.
[01:19:48.670 --> 01:19:49.630]  We're coming for you.
[01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:54.430]  We're getting games at Burger King, Sony, what you gonna do about that?
[01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.030]  How you gonna compete with the Bump King?
[01:19:57.390 --> 01:20:03.390]  You know what's crazy to think about? That dude right there, I don't know who it is, he's 20 years older than he was in that moment.
[01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:05.390]  He's old. He's retired.
[01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:06.710]  We did it.
[01:20:07.210 --> 01:20:07.810]  What a press conference.
[01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:09.650]  That's right. That's right, guys.
[01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:13.390]  Xbox is coming for you, motherfuckers.
[01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.030]  He was told to do something about it.
[01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:17.150]  He invented the gaming industry there.
[01:20:17.770 --> 01:20:18.050]  Yes.
[01:20:19.530 --> 01:20:23.350]  Yeah. And he did, so...
[01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.650]  Now what?
[01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:24.890]  Kudos to him.
[01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.150]  Yeah, so kudos to him.
[01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:26.470]  That was fun.
[01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:31.670]  Now we need to figure out... we need to figure out what we're playing from that or whatever,
[01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:34.550]  because there's stuff in there that's a fucking mess.
[01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:38.330]  I mean, I feel like Full Spectrum Warriors is a clear winner.
[01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:40.910]  Yeah, I think we gotta play some Full Spectrum Warriors.
[01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:42.830]  I don't wanna play Full Spectrum Warriors.
[01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:43.910]  Andrew already has it.
[01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.930]  I do.
[01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:53.690]  I kinda wanna still watch the Xbox E3 equivalent conference this year, just to see how different it is across the 20th century.
[01:20:53.710 --> 01:20:55.790]  Oh man, that would spin your fucking head.
[01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:58.190]  I think that's in like a month. We should do that.
[01:20:58.450 --> 01:20:58.950]  Let's do it.
[01:20:59.030 --> 01:21:00.590]  Anyway, I'm so glad we did this.
[01:21:00.770 --> 01:21:01.650]  Wow, I can't speak.
[01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:03.550]  I'm so glad we did this. This is so much fun.
[01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:06.850]  Thank you guys for joining me in this Look Back 2004.
[01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:08.910]  Let's do it again soon.
[01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:10.410]  Hell yeah.
[01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:13.810]  And if you like that, go listen to Regulation Pocky.
[01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:14.990]  You have to plug the rest of this stuff.
[01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:16.190]  We're on Patreon.
[01:21:16.950 --> 01:21:19.610]  But aren't they already...
[01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.290]  I don't know where does this live.
[01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:24.090]  Yeah, but that's a lot of assumption. You don't know.
[01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:25.470]  We're assuming a lot.
[01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:27.190]  Listen to our podcast.
[01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:28.750]  Andrew, there's no point.
[01:21:29.490 --> 01:21:32.590]  They didn't stay till the end. Nobody watches the full video anymore.
[01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:33.770]  That's a good point, yeah.
[01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:35.070]  We're just talking to ourselves.
[01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.890]  Well, hit that like button, right? Isn't that what they say?

[01:21:39.850 --> 01:21:42.630]  Hey, Andrew, subscribe to Regulation Podcast, okay?
[01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:45.030]  Or, well, yeah, I guess, I don't know.
[01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:47.570]  I don't even know what YouTube this is on.
[01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:48.950]  I don't know.
[01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.530]  The YouTube that we all... there's only one YouTube.
[01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.670]  Were you subscribed to F*** Face?
[01:21:54.130 --> 01:21:55.250]  Yeah, of course I was.
[01:21:55.330 --> 01:21:55.530]  Yeah.
[01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:56.730]  With your personal account?
[01:21:57.610 --> 01:21:57.810]  Yeah.
[01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.750]  Oh, good.
[01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.850]  Not you?
[01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:00.390]  Were you not?
[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:01.330]  No, I was.
[01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:04.510]  I just found out recently that Dan wasn't subscribed to Slow Mo Guys.
[01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:05.030]  What?
[01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.870]  What?
[01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:09.210]  That's crazy.
[01:22:11.730 --> 01:22:14.330]  What is he just like, I gotta see the newest video.
[01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:17.030]  Let me type it into the search bar?
[01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:18.670]  Yeah, I don't think he has an account.
[01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:20.430]  You gotta sub to the one who brung ya.
[01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.790]  I will.
[01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:22.930]  What the f***?
[01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:28.330]  You did remind me, though, that I've been using Achievement Hunter as my YouTube account for many, many, many years now.
[01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:29.450]  I guess I can't anymore.
[01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.970]  Not anymore.
[01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.810]  I guess I don't have that anymore.
[01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:35.150]  Alright, thanks for listening and watching. Bye!
[01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.650]  Bye!
