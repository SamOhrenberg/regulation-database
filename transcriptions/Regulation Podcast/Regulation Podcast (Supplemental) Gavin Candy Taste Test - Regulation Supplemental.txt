[00:00.000 --> 00:01.960]  How are you feeling right now?
[00:02.440 --> 00:07.080]  Well, I can't fully remember the way we talked about doing this.
[00:07.360 --> 00:07.520]  Right.
[00:07.840 --> 00:09.800]  Because I'm gonna know I'm eating a Twix.
[00:10.000 --> 00:10.220]  Uh-huh.
[00:11.240 --> 00:12.460]  And what's happening over here?
[00:13.120 --> 00:15.660]  Oh, we're gonna feed him candy with his eyes closed,
[00:15.760 --> 00:19.060]  and then he's gonna say on a scale of 1 to 10 how he feels about it.
[00:19.360 --> 00:21.220]  1 being the worst, 10 being the best.
[00:21.480 --> 00:24.920]  And then we'll get his raw, unfiltered opinions,
[00:25.120 --> 00:26.880]  and then we'll let him see again at some point.
[00:26.880 --> 00:31.500]  Maybe he can point to what he thought was the best and see if he's right.
[00:31.700 --> 00:34.740]  There you go. And there it is, the official rules from the Candy Bandit.
[00:35.900 --> 00:36.840]  Hey, he disappeared.
[00:38.380 --> 00:39.600]  All right, blindfold the man.
[00:40.600 --> 00:41.400]  When possible...
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.740]  This is cool. This is fetish content that people have been waiting years for.
[00:44.840 --> 00:45.500]  This is fantastic.
[00:46.100 --> 00:49.440]  When possible, one should always be blindfolded.
[00:49.500 --> 00:49.900]  Oh, okay.
[00:50.300 --> 00:51.880]  When tasting anything.
[00:52.120 --> 00:53.580]  I'm glad you clarified that.
[00:54.020 --> 00:58.560]  You don't want your eyeballs to affect your taste buds.
[00:58.900 --> 01:00.260]  It's all connected, you see.
[01:00.880 --> 01:04.640]  You have to eliminate one sense to enhance the others.
[01:04.920 --> 01:06.240]  Yeah, does it smell like farts in here or what?
[01:06.500 --> 01:07.760]  All right, so this is the first one.
[01:09.680 --> 01:11.920]  Gavin, can you show me the one that you had there?
[01:12.260 --> 01:12.520]  Okay.
[01:12.820 --> 01:15.120]  Gavin, now initial impressions on touch?
[01:16.020 --> 01:16.280]  Almost.
[01:17.020 --> 01:17.200]  Yep.
[01:17.600 --> 01:18.980]  Oh, it's quite thin, isn't it?
[01:20.180 --> 01:20.440]  Okay.
[01:20.600 --> 01:21.240]  He's heard that before.
[01:24.260 --> 01:24.900]  Ready now?
[01:25.360 --> 01:25.560]  Yeah.
[01:25.680 --> 01:25.840]  Okay.
[01:26.460 --> 01:26.940]  Also bad.
[01:28.620 --> 01:29.400]  Well, it's peanut butter.
[01:30.380 --> 01:30.700]  Okay.
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.900]  Is this a jar of peanut butter?
[01:35.480 --> 01:36.800]  Hang on. No.
[01:37.060 --> 01:38.020]  No, we didn't bring the jar.
[01:39.560 --> 01:41.240]  You don't have to eat the whole thing. You can if you want.
[01:41.320 --> 01:41.580]  Pretty good.
[01:42.080 --> 01:43.080]  What do you, what do you think?
[01:43.280 --> 01:44.040]  Scale of one to ten.
[01:45.200 --> 01:45.520]  Six.
[01:45.840 --> 01:46.160]  Okay.
[01:46.520 --> 01:48.500]  Oh, okay, I like it.
[01:49.220 --> 01:49.400]  Okay.
[01:49.840 --> 01:50.780]  Oh, this is a good one.
[01:51.500 --> 01:52.360]  It is a good one.
[01:52.360 --> 01:52.980]  This is gonna be a good one.
[01:52.980 --> 01:54.200]  I'm very excited.
[01:54.560 --> 01:55.240]  This is good.
[01:55.340 --> 01:55.940]  Very curious.
[01:56.280 --> 01:56.520]  Number two.
[01:57.480 --> 01:59.120]  Okay, number two in.
[02:00.140 --> 02:00.880]  Go for it.
[02:02.120 --> 02:02.560]  Almost.
[02:03.200 --> 02:03.940]  There you go.
[02:05.140 --> 02:05.580]  Okay.
[02:05.940 --> 02:06.540]  What do you think?
[02:06.600 --> 02:07.560]  Oh, it feels like a KitKat.
[02:07.700 --> 02:08.060]  Okay.
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.820]  It's a KitKat.
[02:16.200 --> 02:17.620]  So what were we doing with this?
[02:18.500 --> 02:19.380]  I'm gonna taste it.
[02:19.380 --> 02:20.300]  Yeah, what do you taste?
[02:21.020 --> 02:23.120]  I thought I was tasting the ones I've never had.
[02:23.920 --> 02:24.460]  This is just everything.
[02:24.960 --> 02:25.800]  Scale of one to ten.
[02:27.620 --> 02:27.980]  Seven.
[02:28.680 --> 02:29.000]  Okay.
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.060]  This is everything that wasn't your thing or Andrew's fake shit.
[02:32.240 --> 02:32.400]  Yeah.
[02:33.260 --> 02:35.520]  Okay, and what are you thinking about this one so far?
[02:36.560 --> 02:36.920]  Thoughts?
[02:37.120 --> 02:37.660]  Oh, Christ.
[02:41.960 --> 02:43.160]  I don't even remember the names of it.
[02:43.280 --> 02:44.780]  What was the one that was like a lion bar?
[02:45.380 --> 02:46.300]  I don't know what a lion bar is.
[02:46.300 --> 02:47.140]  What's a lion bar?
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.580]  Kind of like this.
[02:51.700 --> 02:52.640]  How are you feeling about this?
[02:52.640 --> 02:52.980]  Like...
[02:56.340 --> 02:58.040]  It's just three Americans going,
[02:58.300 --> 02:59.360]  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
[02:59.780 --> 03:00.720]  How are you feeling about this?
[03:00.760 --> 03:01.800]  Just give it a fucking rating.
[03:02.880 --> 03:03.980]  That's probably a five, that one.
[03:04.080 --> 03:04.320]  Okay.
[03:05.040 --> 03:05.720]  Interesting, okay.
[03:06.400 --> 03:06.680]  Okay.
[03:06.920 --> 03:08.400]  And now, next...
[03:09.900 --> 03:12.580]  What could this one be?
[03:13.080 --> 03:14.320]  That was a lot of razor blades, Geoff.
[03:15.880 --> 03:16.180]  Uh-huh.
[03:16.820 --> 03:17.140]  Okay.
[03:20.220 --> 03:20.620]  Oh, yeah.
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.540]  It's an M&M.
[03:22.860 --> 03:23.560]  Oh, okay.
[03:24.020 --> 03:24.220]  Wait.
[03:27.120 --> 03:28.140]  What is it?
[03:28.500 --> 03:29.500]  Was it not a peanut?
[03:32.540 --> 03:32.940]  Okay.
[03:33.900 --> 03:34.520]  And what do you think?
[03:35.380 --> 03:36.960]  More complicated than you thought initially.
[03:37.480 --> 03:38.140]  You fool.
[03:39.680 --> 03:40.540]  What was the other one?
[03:40.640 --> 03:41.220]  Was it a piece?
[03:42.960 --> 03:45.120]  There are M&Ms and pieces, yes.
[03:45.880 --> 03:47.680]  But the pieces are meant to be peanut butter, right?
[03:48.640 --> 03:49.300]  Or is that not wrong?
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.000]  Meant to be, yeah.
[03:50.000 --> 03:51.900]  So what do you give this one, man?
[03:52.220 --> 03:53.400]  It just tastes like a peanut M&M.
[03:53.520 --> 03:53.820]  Okay.
[03:54.080 --> 03:54.300]  Okay.
[03:54.540 --> 03:55.400]  Right, that's not a number.
[04:00.820 --> 04:01.500]  It's an eight.
[04:01.800 --> 04:02.300]  An eight?
[04:02.400 --> 04:02.840]  Okay.
[04:03.460 --> 04:06.560]  Okay, Gavin, your next is ready whenever you are.
[04:07.880 --> 04:08.220]  Almost.
[04:09.220 --> 04:09.520]  Almost.
[04:10.280 --> 04:10.720]  Almost.
[04:10.880 --> 04:11.320]  There you go.
[04:11.520 --> 04:13.100]  Why is it, like, gooey?
[04:13.280 --> 04:13.540]  Okay.
[04:14.220 --> 04:15.200]  Is this, like...
[04:15.200 --> 04:17.620]  It's just the shit we talked about, man.
[04:18.460 --> 04:19.140]  There's no surprises.
[04:23.300 --> 04:24.580]  Oh, the raisins.
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.240]  When do we talk about raisins?
[04:27.680 --> 04:27.840]  What?
[04:29.020 --> 04:29.480]  Yesterday.
[04:29.980 --> 04:30.500]  Eat it.
[04:30.840 --> 04:31.160]  Eat it.
[04:31.320 --> 04:32.360]  That's my worst candy.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.200]  And what do you rate it?
[04:36.100 --> 04:36.560]  Two.
[04:36.820 --> 04:37.220]  Okay.
[04:39.620 --> 04:41.960]  When do we talk about raisins?
[04:43.960 --> 04:44.700]  Oh my god.
[04:44.740 --> 04:46.040]  Get into your pick and kicker picture.
[04:46.160 --> 04:46.740]  What are we doing?
[04:48.920 --> 04:49.640]  Oh, man.
[04:49.640 --> 04:51.240]  You ready for your next one, Gavin?
[04:51.460 --> 04:51.640]  Yeah.
[04:52.260 --> 04:53.520]  Hang on.
[04:53.960 --> 04:54.480]  Patience.
[04:54.980 --> 04:55.500]  Patience.
[04:55.700 --> 04:55.800]  Okay.
[04:57.160 --> 04:57.660]  All right.
[04:58.200 --> 04:59.500]  Now, whenever you're ready.
[05:01.020 --> 05:01.380]  Almost.
[05:01.840 --> 05:02.280]  Almost.
[05:03.160 --> 05:03.400]  Okay.
[05:04.740 --> 05:05.200]  Okay.
[05:17.450 --> 05:19.290]  It's like an American smiley.
[05:19.810 --> 05:21.150]  Okay, and what do you rate it?
[05:21.530 --> 05:21.890]  One.
[05:22.530 --> 05:23.010]  One?
[05:23.190 --> 05:23.630]  Wow.
[05:23.710 --> 05:24.890]  It's not worse than a raisin.
[05:25.170 --> 05:25.370]  Two.
[05:25.990 --> 05:26.350]  Okay.
[05:26.790 --> 05:28.110]  You and Nick are aligned.
[05:28.330 --> 05:28.550]  Okay.
[05:28.550 --> 05:29.250]  Next.
[05:31.690 --> 05:32.170]  Almost.
[05:33.610 --> 05:34.090]  Okay.
[05:34.630 --> 05:35.210]  Oh, no.
[05:35.330 --> 05:36.390]  Is this a freaking...
[05:37.830 --> 05:38.490]  Don't lick.
[05:54.190 --> 05:55.750]  That really bummed me out.
[05:57.870 --> 05:59.350]  And what do you rate it?
[05:59.370 --> 05:59.670]  One.
[06:00.370 --> 06:02.130]  How come a raisin might be bummed out by candy?
[06:04.310 --> 06:05.590]  All right, Gavin.
[06:06.490 --> 06:08.390]  Gavin, hopefully this will cheer you up.
[06:08.670 --> 06:10.490]  Next one, locked in.
[06:10.690 --> 06:11.310]  All right.
[06:13.070 --> 06:16.650]  I would love to, in the middle of this video, play the part from the episode
[06:16.650 --> 06:19.230]  where we describe what we were doing and see if it's anything like this.
[06:19.530 --> 06:23.850]  I would love to taste all of the stuff on this list that I've never had,
[06:24.090 --> 06:25.630]  blind, and then put them in order.
[06:26.050 --> 06:27.850]  That sounds like a great piece of supplement.
[06:27.850 --> 06:28.670]  Now, here's the thing.
[06:28.770 --> 06:31.610]  That wouldn't be super hard to do because most of these things
[06:31.610 --> 06:33.670]  would probably just come in one bag from Target.
[06:33.950 --> 06:34.750]  I think this is it.
[06:34.990 --> 06:35.170]  Ooh.
[06:38.610 --> 06:39.990]  God forbid we pivot.
[06:41.470 --> 06:44.110]  All right, but pivoting and not remembering my favorite.
[06:45.270 --> 06:46.890]  Pivot and forget are two different things.
[06:48.950 --> 06:49.250]  Mm-hmm.
[06:49.810 --> 06:50.430]  Uh-huh.
[06:52.030 --> 06:52.790]  Not a winner.
[06:53.370 --> 06:54.470]  Did he put it back?
[06:54.650 --> 06:54.830]  Yeah.
[06:56.430 --> 06:57.510]  What'd he give that?
[06:57.930 --> 06:58.370]  Oh, one.
[07:00.750 --> 07:01.230]  Okay.
[07:01.890 --> 07:03.030]  I'm a chocolate guy.
[07:03.170 --> 07:04.650]  Yeah, I think you and I are pretty aligned.
[07:05.250 --> 07:06.330]  I think you and I are pretty aligned.
[07:06.410 --> 07:08.610]  We're getting pretty close to the end here.
[07:08.870 --> 07:10.490]  Have a couple of these bad boys.
[07:12.190 --> 07:13.130]  You're doing great.
[07:13.190 --> 07:13.930]  You're doing great work.
[07:15.690 --> 07:17.990]  I'm getting so much more of Gavin's candy than you.
[07:18.170 --> 07:18.450]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:18.710 --> 07:19.830]  I'm gonna follow you on that trip.
[07:20.630 --> 07:21.350]  It's a piece.
[07:21.670 --> 07:22.070]  Okay.
[07:22.470 --> 07:22.870]  A what?
[07:25.170 --> 07:26.930]  And you were thinking it is...
[07:28.130 --> 07:28.490]  Five.
[07:28.870 --> 07:31.490]  All right, I think this is what we have left.
[07:31.730 --> 07:32.690]  I believe that's right.
[07:32.690 --> 07:34.790]  I think you should do this one.
[07:34.970 --> 07:36.310]  Okay, that's a good one.
[07:37.550 --> 07:39.430]  So what was the one you couldn't find?
[07:40.070 --> 07:40.670]  A hundred grand.
[07:41.190 --> 07:42.770]  And that was one of the important ones.
[07:42.990 --> 07:45.650]  Yeah, and I went to four places.
[07:45.750 --> 07:46.330]  Could not find it.
[07:46.530 --> 07:46.670]  Wow.
[07:46.870 --> 07:47.870]  I tried two.
[07:48.050 --> 07:50.670]  I think they're usually in like the group bags.
[07:51.150 --> 07:51.450]  I looked.
[07:51.970 --> 07:52.470]  I looked.
[07:53.370 --> 07:55.050]  All right, Gavin.
[07:57.890 --> 07:58.370]  Snickies.
[08:00.510 --> 08:00.730]  Wait.
[08:01.650 --> 08:02.170]  Cool.
[08:02.430 --> 08:02.810]  Is it?
[08:04.770 --> 08:06.630]  Or like a stale Twix?
[08:06.810 --> 08:07.110]  Okay.
[08:09.070 --> 08:10.230]  I think it's a Snickers.
[08:10.490 --> 08:10.970]  Okay.
[08:12.190 --> 08:12.630]  Seven.
[08:12.970 --> 08:13.450]  Seven.
[08:14.250 --> 08:14.510]  Okay.
[08:14.930 --> 08:16.470]  I'll take your Snick.
[08:17.290 --> 08:17.810]  Jesus.
[08:18.930 --> 08:20.090]  What have you put in there?
[08:21.050 --> 08:21.570]  Candy.
[08:21.710 --> 08:22.050]  A candy.
[08:22.170 --> 08:22.950]  Is it a dog food?
[08:23.250 --> 08:23.490]  No.
[08:23.830 --> 08:24.370]  It's candy.
[08:24.450 --> 08:25.410]  It's candy, I promise.
[08:26.270 --> 08:26.810]  Nick promises.
[08:27.070 --> 08:28.530]  Yeah, there's no baking switch happening.
[08:28.630 --> 08:29.670]  Why is it so wet?
[08:30.250 --> 08:30.590]  It's candy.
[08:30.730 --> 08:32.230]  It's not wet.
[08:32.670 --> 08:32.970]  Is it?
[08:33.450 --> 08:34.130]  Is this a trick?
[08:34.450 --> 08:34.670]  No.
[08:36.850 --> 08:38.410]  There are no trick candies here.
[08:38.470 --> 08:39.130]  Because nothing isn't...
[08:40.330 --> 08:40.650]  Oh.
[08:47.630 --> 08:48.070]  Oh.
[08:48.330 --> 08:50.030]  Never seen that reaction to that candy before.
[08:50.230 --> 08:50.530]  Uh-uh.
[08:51.630 --> 08:52.810]  It's very peanut buttery.
[08:52.950 --> 08:53.430]  Uh-huh.
[08:54.910 --> 08:55.350]  Five.
[08:55.730 --> 08:56.150]  Okay.
[08:56.930 --> 08:57.830]  I'm just amazed.
[08:57.970 --> 09:03.130]  I have spent, I don't know, 15, 18, 19 years being Gavin's friend.
[09:03.350 --> 09:03.490]  Yeah.
[09:03.490 --> 09:07.570]  And it has been frustrating because he will never eat any kind of candy or fun food with me.
[09:08.290 --> 09:09.390]  He doesn't want to drink a soda.
[09:09.730 --> 09:10.350]  He doesn't want to eat anything.
[09:10.350 --> 09:12.250]  But look at this, he's drinking so many candies.
[09:12.590 --> 09:13.050]  I have, I know.
[09:13.290 --> 09:15.390]  But I think I've watched too many of your teeth get pulled apart.
[09:15.510 --> 09:16.370]  Oh yeah, you know what?
[09:16.430 --> 09:17.030]  That's a fair point.
[09:17.250 --> 09:19.070]  I don't know if the two have anything to do with each other.
[09:20.130 --> 09:20.770]  Big drink.
[09:22.090 --> 09:22.410]  Yep.
[09:24.270 --> 09:24.590]  Twix.
[09:27.490 --> 09:28.390]  It is a Twix, right?
[09:29.950 --> 09:30.690]  You tell us.
[09:30.810 --> 09:31.050]  Is it?
[09:39.020 --> 09:40.160]  Yeah, seven.
[09:41.020 --> 09:43.080]  Okay, and then your last one.
[09:48.910 --> 09:50.310]  Don't blindfold look at me.
[09:51.270 --> 09:52.490]  Eat your fucking candy.
[09:58.670 --> 09:59.230]  Thank you.
[10:05.030 --> 10:06.530]  Let's try to get some flavor out of it.
[10:06.570 --> 10:06.750]  Okay.
[10:08.690 --> 10:09.210]  Repulsive.
[10:10.210 --> 10:11.130]  And one.
[10:11.370 --> 10:11.590]  One.
[10:11.810 --> 10:12.050]  Okay.
[10:13.050 --> 10:13.450]  Gavin.
[10:13.810 --> 10:13.990]  Yeah.
[10:14.190 --> 10:16.650]  Your official candy ranking is complete.
[10:16.870 --> 10:17.130]  Okay.
[10:17.190 --> 10:19.370]  You may, you may remove your blindfold.
[10:19.370 --> 10:23.370]  I feel like it was maybe only two or three that I've never had.
[10:23.750 --> 10:26.010]  So, your official candy rankings.
[10:26.450 --> 10:27.250]  Your worst.
[10:27.530 --> 10:28.910]  Your least favorite.
[10:29.410 --> 10:32.050]  The ones that you disliked the most.
[10:32.150 --> 10:32.590]  Blow Pop.
[10:32.890 --> 10:33.190]  One.
[10:33.570 --> 10:34.210]  Crazy.
[10:34.630 --> 10:35.410]  Sour Patch Kid.
[10:35.950 --> 10:36.270]  One.
[10:37.470 --> 10:38.510]  Candy Corn.
[10:39.030 --> 10:39.490]  One.
[10:39.990 --> 10:42.370]  Those are the tie for last place.
[10:42.830 --> 10:43.410]  Those are the ones.
[10:44.210 --> 10:44.850]  Next.
[10:45.950 --> 10:47.090]  At a rank of two.
[10:48.710 --> 10:49.350]  Raisins.
[10:49.930 --> 10:51.510]  And Smarties.
[10:53.730 --> 10:54.490]  Good pick.
[10:56.430 --> 10:57.450]  Nothing at three.
[10:58.070 --> 10:59.050]  Nothing at four.
[10:59.710 --> 11:00.750]  At five.
[11:01.370 --> 11:07.210]  You have put Butterfinger and Reese's Pieces.
[11:07.490 --> 11:07.610]  Yep.
[11:08.930 --> 11:09.450]  Six.
[11:09.850 --> 11:10.770]  The first one that you had.
[11:10.970 --> 11:11.850]  Mr. Good Bar.
[11:12.270 --> 11:13.670]  You said, oh, this is peanut butter.
[11:13.910 --> 11:14.670]  It's just peanuts.
[11:15.710 --> 11:23.070]  Oh, also you put Reese's, the regular Reese's also at five.
[11:25.630 --> 11:27.310]  The one that you said was wet.
[11:27.830 --> 11:28.590]  That was a Reese's.
[11:28.610 --> 11:29.810]  That was essentially the pumpkin.
[11:30.030 --> 11:30.590]  Yeah, it was a metal.
[11:30.850 --> 11:31.530]  Oh, the big.
[11:32.430 --> 11:32.630]  Yeah.
[11:37.750 --> 11:38.390]  Reese's metal.
[11:38.710 --> 11:39.270]  Yeah, it's too much.
[11:39.550 --> 11:40.330]  Can I investigate that?
[11:40.430 --> 11:41.810]  It's probably because it's leftover from the Olympics.
[11:43.430 --> 11:44.510]  Um, Mr. Good Bar.
[11:44.510 --> 11:45.030]  You put six.
[11:45.090 --> 11:45.730]  I'll split it with you, Nick.
[11:46.030 --> 11:46.090]  Okay.
[11:46.930 --> 11:48.110]  There's so much more candy.
[11:48.350 --> 11:49.450]  Oh, okay.
[11:49.670 --> 11:49.810]  Cool.
[11:50.430 --> 11:51.750]  Where do you think all this came from?
[11:51.810 --> 11:52.610]  There's a giant bag.
[11:54.130 --> 11:54.850]  At seven.
[11:55.390 --> 11:56.510]  It's a hell of a tie.
[11:57.190 --> 11:57.590]  Kit Kat.
[11:57.910 --> 11:58.210]  Seven.
[11:59.310 --> 11:59.670]  Snickers.
[12:00.150 --> 12:00.510]  Snickies.
[12:00.850 --> 12:01.210]  Seven.
[12:02.230 --> 12:02.590]  Twix.
[12:02.870 --> 12:03.650]  Also a seven.
[12:03.830 --> 12:04.690]  How do you feel about those rankings?
[12:05.050 --> 12:06.030]  You think those are all equal?
[12:06.310 --> 12:08.190]  I would always eat them if they're in a bowl.
[12:08.470 --> 12:10.150]  I would never go and buy one at the shops.
[12:11.110 --> 12:13.270]  In your first place candy on everything that you ate.
[12:14.510 --> 12:15.070]  Peanut M&M.
[12:15.350 --> 12:15.810]  At eight.
[12:17.670 --> 12:22.790]  So, would you consider that to be a regulation British person's guide to American candy?
[12:24.490 --> 12:24.850]  I think so.
[12:24.890 --> 12:26.410]  If you didn't give me any Hershey's.
[12:27.050 --> 12:27.470]  You're welcome.
[12:27.530 --> 12:29.910]  Which would have been probably number one, I would say.
[12:30.810 --> 12:32.190]  Number one best or number one worst?
[12:32.650 --> 12:33.510]  Number one on the ranking.
[12:33.910 --> 12:34.630]  No, I don't think so.
[12:34.950 --> 12:36.250]  On one to ten.
[12:36.350 --> 12:36.870]  Ten being good.
[12:36.970 --> 12:38.010]  One being a piece of shit.
[12:38.110 --> 12:38.250]  Oh.
[12:38.890 --> 12:39.550]  You actually did.
[12:39.750 --> 12:40.910]  Mr. Good Bar is Hershey's.
[12:40.950 --> 12:41.170]  Is it?
[12:41.310 --> 12:41.450]  Yeah.
[12:41.790 --> 12:43.350]  Wow, that went pretty high for a Hershey's.
[12:43.470 --> 12:43.610]  Yeah.
[12:43.610 --> 12:46.490]  So, it would be first place or last place?
[12:47.850 --> 12:49.150]  I think he's saying it would be last.
[12:49.170 --> 12:49.770]  It would be last place.
[12:49.830 --> 12:50.090]  Oh.
[12:50.550 --> 12:52.430]  But he keeps saying it would be number one.
[12:52.550 --> 12:53.270]  Number one.
[12:53.570 --> 12:54.290]  One, it'd be one.
[12:54.330 --> 12:55.050]  It'd be like blow pop.
[12:55.270 --> 12:56.910]  I would give it a one.
[12:57.030 --> 12:58.550]  Is what he's trying to say.
[12:58.590 --> 12:59.250]  Not the number one.
[12:59.250 --> 13:00.350]  I should have a immunity bullet right now.
[13:07.210 --> 13:09.790]  Should now you all do this with all the British shit?
[13:10.010 --> 13:10.230]  Yeah.
[13:10.330 --> 13:10.910]  Yeah, sure.
[13:11.030 --> 13:11.570]  All right.
[13:11.570 --> 13:11.750]  Yeah.
[13:11.750 --> 13:14.290]  I'd like to get an American's rankings.
[13:14.950 --> 13:15.610]  He is right.
[13:15.730 --> 13:16.610]  These are a little wet.
[13:17.270 --> 13:17.750]  Yeah.
[13:18.170 --> 13:19.490]  Well, what are you gonna do?
[13:20.770 --> 13:23.390]  My HEB is not the best HEB.
[13:24.010 --> 13:24.810]  I understand.
[13:25.850 --> 13:26.510]  Good candy.
[13:26.650 --> 13:27.050]  Happy Halloween.
[13:30.750 --> 13:31.550]  Make a wave.
[13:32.170 --> 13:32.770]  You want a wave?
[13:33.110 --> 13:33.550]  You want a wave?
[13:33.570 --> 13:34.170]  Happy Halloween.
