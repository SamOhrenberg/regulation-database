[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  You guys know dartboards, right?
[00:01.640 --> 00:02.260]  Yeah. Yes.
[00:02.340 --> 00:03.880]  You have a dartboard. It's round.
[00:04.120 --> 00:07.220]  You play the game where you try to get the the the dart in the middle
[00:07.220 --> 00:08.920]  or strategically around the edges.
[00:09.160 --> 00:10.160]  There's games called cricket.
[00:10.340 --> 00:12.660]  There's just like, but they're dartboard games.
[00:13.140 --> 00:15.900]  Why don't we have dart board games?
[00:16.340 --> 00:17.220]  Why does a dart?
[00:17.340 --> 00:20.140]  What does a dartboard have to be just a circular thing on a wall?
[00:20.220 --> 00:21.500]  Why can't it be much larger?
[00:21.760 --> 00:24.980]  Why can't it be like Candyland and you're throwing darts
[00:24.980 --> 00:27.920]  to go places on the board and then you end up being like, oh, I missed.
[00:28.020 --> 00:29.620]  I'm in the fucking I'm in the swamp.
[00:29.620 --> 00:31.360]  I got to go back three darts or whatever.
[00:31.600 --> 00:35.500]  Why do we why can't we innovate on the dart board itself?
[00:35.800 --> 00:39.480]  I think we can revolutionize the dart board industry and dart boards.
[00:39.680 --> 00:41.060]  Darts as a sport in general.
[00:41.100 --> 00:42.960]  I mean, you got a few dart things.
[00:43.060 --> 00:44.400]  You got a lawn darts.
[00:44.620 --> 00:45.620]  You got the dart board.
[00:45.820 --> 00:50.420]  You got the throwing balloons or no, you throw the darts, not the balloons.
[00:50.780 --> 00:51.740]  Now, what about that?
[00:52.040 --> 00:55.560]  What if you had to throw the balloons at the darts?
