[00:00.000 --> 00:01.860]  Now, let's see your picks, Gracie. I'm excited.
[00:02.300 --> 00:05.580]  Gracie, this is your first entry into our draft.
[00:05.800 --> 00:08.580]  So what do you think? Who are you picking?
[00:08.720 --> 00:09.900]  What's your number one dog here?
[00:10.160 --> 00:11.940]  Well, it was going to be Air Bud.
[00:12.220 --> 00:13.580]  So thanks a lot, Andrew.
[00:14.020 --> 00:15.820]  We'll blame Nick. I want a Scooby.
[00:16.660 --> 00:18.240]  I will default to my second.
[00:19.300 --> 00:23.420]  I was a big claymation kid, so I have to go with Gromit of Wallace and Gromit.
[00:23.620 --> 00:26.560]  Oh! Take that, Gavin!
[00:27.460 --> 00:29.080]  Ooh, I bet that hurts, Gavin.
[00:29.350 --> 00:32.120]  I feel like that's sort of my territory, but that's fine.
[00:32.220 --> 00:33.720]  Yeah. Well, is that one of your four?
[00:33.940 --> 00:35.500]  I'm sorry. Are you the British Jackal?
[00:35.960 --> 00:36.720]  Good point.
[00:37.720 --> 00:39.120]  That's great. That's great.
[00:41.400 --> 00:45.860]  Now, I'm not super familiar with Wallace and Gromit.
[00:46.060 --> 00:47.240]  Like, I know of them.
[00:47.560 --> 00:51.580]  It's just not something that I watched or am, like, super knowledgeable of.
[00:51.800 --> 00:56.480]  Is Gromit, like, Gromit's the dog and he's very smart?
[00:56.720 --> 00:57.800]  Is that, like, his thing?
[00:58.260 --> 00:59.340]  Yeah, but he's silent.
[00:59.760 --> 01:01.680]  Yeah. It's like Penn and Teller.
[01:01.980 --> 01:03.080]  Yeah, I get it. Okay.
[01:03.580 --> 01:04.540]  Okay. You should have watched them.
[01:05.100 --> 01:07.200]  And then Wallace goes, Oh, hello, Gromit.
[01:07.340 --> 01:08.700]  We're going to have a tea.
[01:09.420 --> 01:10.620]  And she's on the move!
[01:10.640 --> 01:11.560]  Very offensive, but yeah.
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.440]  Man, I heard a story about the start of the origin of Penn and Teller the other day that I did not know.
[01:17.860 --> 01:19.900]  Did you know that Teller...
[01:19.900 --> 01:21.960]  Wait, which one is the dude with the big dude?
[01:22.380 --> 01:24.180]  Penn. Penn Gillette.
[01:24.180 --> 01:31.700]  Penn Gillette was a high school senior when he met Teller, who was a high school teacher.
[01:31.960 --> 01:34.620]  And Teller was like, Do you want me to teach you magic?
[01:34.820 --> 01:36.360]  And he was like, I guess so.
[01:36.440 --> 01:38.040]  And that's how they got started.
[01:38.620 --> 01:39.420]  Is that for real?
[01:39.660 --> 01:40.420]  That's for real.
[01:40.580 --> 01:43.980]  I saw a TikTok of him explaining their origin.
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.100]  Can you... like, that's not how that story is supposed to...
[01:47.100 --> 01:48.060]  Like, nobody went to jail?
[01:48.520 --> 01:48.880]  That's crazy.
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.800]  Listen, Geoff, I respect what you're saying.
[01:53.000 --> 01:55.500]  Gavin, you're like 30, I'm 25.
[01:55.580 --> 01:57.700]  We were friends when I was 13.
[01:58.160 --> 01:58.800]  You are not...
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.300]  I mean...
[01:59.300 --> 02:00.420]  You're not a person to...
[02:00.420 --> 02:01.820]  Yeah, but we weren't doing magic.
[02:02.340 --> 02:05.140]  I didn't ask if you wanted to do magic, I just wanted to play video games.
[02:05.300 --> 02:06.440]  Magic is the line.
[02:06.560 --> 02:08.520]  He never said, guess what's in this box.
[02:08.680 --> 02:10.460]  Yeah, I didn't say, like, put your hand in my pocket.
[02:10.480 --> 02:13.380]  He was a juggler, and I feel like that makes it less...
[02:13.380 --> 02:17.640]  Like, you're already in a world of deviancy if you're a master juggler.
[02:18.080 --> 02:18.740]  I just looked.
[02:18.800 --> 02:20.780]  They have a seven-year age difference.
[02:21.360 --> 02:23.540]  Teller, as of this recording, is 76.
[02:24.720 --> 02:26.340]  And Penn Jillette, 69.
[02:26.600 --> 02:27.120]  That's crazy.
[02:27.140 --> 02:29.720]  I always assumed my teachers were, like, 20 years older.
[02:29.940 --> 02:32.300]  The idea of, like, a seven-year difference is crazy.
[02:32.480 --> 02:32.700]  Yeah.
[02:32.820 --> 02:33.800]  Oh, and it really was.
[02:33.800 --> 02:35.840]  Some of the teachers, it was maybe a seven-year difference.
[02:35.960 --> 02:36.740]  That's fucking wild.
[02:36.960 --> 02:37.280]  Wow.
[02:37.780 --> 02:42.380]  Well, Gromit is a good pick, and Gracie, the way we do this is that it's a snake draft,
[02:42.460 --> 02:43.560]  so now we go back the other way.
[02:43.980 --> 02:47.700]  So you get a second pick, right on top of Gromit.
[02:48.340 --> 02:48.520]  Okay.
[02:49.980 --> 02:56.580]  I need to get a picture for this one, but I'm going to go with Callie and Joe Jr. from
[02:56.580 --> 02:57.280]  The Office.
[02:58.360 --> 02:58.840]  What?
[02:58.940 --> 03:00.020]  Joe, Bennett, and Dawgs.
[03:00.140 --> 03:00.440]  I've never seen those dogs in my life.
[03:00.680 --> 03:03.180]  The big-ass Great Danes that sniff Andy's crotch.
[03:03.340 --> 03:04.700]  What the fuck?
[03:06.060 --> 03:07.160]  Which one are you picking?
[03:07.800 --> 03:08.720]  Well, both.
[03:08.940 --> 03:09.700]  They're a team.
[03:10.040 --> 03:10.420]  Oh.
[03:10.940 --> 03:11.320]  Oh?
[03:11.640 --> 03:11.960]  All right.
[03:11.980 --> 03:12.680]  You know what?
[03:12.960 --> 03:13.120]  Sure.
[03:13.180 --> 03:16.400]  I'll, you know, I'll give her that.
[03:16.400 --> 03:18.840]  This is going to kill with the millennial crowd.
[03:18.980 --> 03:19.980]  I guarantee you.
[03:20.620 --> 03:21.420]  Dude, not me.
[03:21.540 --> 03:21.860]  I love The Office.
[03:22.020 --> 03:22.640]  I don't know this.
[03:22.700 --> 03:24.060]  I don't know this at all.
[03:24.240 --> 03:24.600]  I don't either.
[03:24.600 --> 03:25.580]  Did anyone watch The Office?
[03:26.160 --> 03:26.340]  Nah.
[03:26.520 --> 03:29.300]  It's not our Bible like it is for the young people.
[03:29.820 --> 03:33.000]  I think I turn it off before she shows up, usually, and just start again at the beginning.
[03:33.660 --> 03:34.840]  It's about the time to do it.
[03:35.380 --> 03:41.440]  I think the end of season three, where Jim assed out Pam, is the logical conclusion of
[03:41.440 --> 03:41.940]  that show.
[03:42.040 --> 03:42.360]  Yeah.
[03:43.280 --> 03:45.480]  I'm not into post-Sabre.
[03:46.240 --> 03:46.380]  Yeah.
[03:46.380 --> 03:46.500]  Yeah.
[03:46.580 --> 03:49.620]  And then there's like Robert, Robert, California, whatever.
[03:49.920 --> 03:50.020]  Yeah.
[03:50.360 --> 03:52.360]  And you just kind of go like, I don't think I need this anymore.
[03:52.440 --> 03:57.720]  I think I've got everything that I want, but cool dogs, deep cut pick, deep cut pick for
[03:57.720 --> 03:58.500]  a number two.
[03:58.820 --> 03:59.480]  Oh, I have deeper.
[03:59.820 --> 04:00.140]  Yeah.
[04:00.240 --> 04:03.740]  I mean, I don't think those are probably on Andrew's list at all.
[04:05.860 --> 04:06.480]  Gromit was.
[04:06.680 --> 04:08.160]  Gromit was 20 on my list.
[04:08.340 --> 04:09.340]  Of course, Gromit was.
[04:09.340 --> 04:09.700]  You put Gromit at 20?
[04:09.840 --> 04:10.120]  You're an idiot.
[04:10.620 --> 04:10.800]  Yeah.
[04:10.840 --> 04:11.340]  That's low.
[04:12.080 --> 04:13.500]  Listen, you don't know my board.
[04:13.560 --> 04:13.760]  Okay.
[04:13.780 --> 04:15.260]  I got, I got a, I got a big list here.
