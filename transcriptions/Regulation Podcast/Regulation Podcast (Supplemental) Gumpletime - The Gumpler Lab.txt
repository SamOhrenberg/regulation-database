[00:00.000 --> 00:00.360]  Ready?
[00:00.560 --> 00:00.700]  Yep.
[00:00.760 --> 00:01.320]  3, 2, 1.
[00:01.540 --> 00:02.040]  Thank you.
[00:02.180 --> 00:02.420]  Mm-hmm.
[00:03.560 --> 00:04.300]  You gonna kiss?
[00:05.860 --> 00:06.580]  I hit a button.
[00:06.840 --> 00:09.280]  What did you do?
[00:09.420 --> 00:09.800]  9-1-1.
[00:10.000 --> 00:10.220]  Hello?
[00:11.760 --> 00:12.680]  Are you calling Andrew?
[00:12.780 --> 00:12.900]  Hello?
[00:12.900 --> 00:14.240]  I was just wiping some ham off his eye.
[00:14.260 --> 00:16.160]  I assume he's just playing a call sound, right?
[00:16.440 --> 00:17.940]  I hit a- I hit that button in the middle.
[00:18.340 --> 00:19.220]  Oh, you called 9-1-1?
[00:21.260 --> 00:21.580]  Stop.
[00:23.960 --> 00:24.280]  Hello?
[00:24.540 --> 00:25.400]  Did that call your phone?
[00:27.160 --> 00:28.180]  I think so, yeah.
[00:33.820 --> 00:34.220]  Wow.
[00:34.560 --> 00:34.960]  Crazy.
[00:36.320 --> 00:37.980]  Okay, we're gonna start this now.
[00:38.180 --> 00:38.280]  Ready?
[00:44.400 --> 00:45.860]  And here we go, it's the gumbler!
[00:46.100 --> 00:47.420]  This is Gavin's idea.
[00:48.540 --> 00:51.320]  Gavin has been talking about doing a gumbler for years now.
[00:51.380 --> 00:54.460]  And today, now that we have the office, we're finally able to do it.
[00:55.200 --> 00:58.460]  Only because of the support of you are we able to make a gumbler.
[00:58.540 --> 01:01.320]  And also, if we did this at Emily's house, she would kill us.
[01:01.480 --> 01:01.780]  That's true.
[01:01.980 --> 01:02.680]  Yeah, I got-
[01:02.680 --> 01:03.240]  No!
[01:04.800 --> 01:06.080]  I saved him!
[01:06.380 --> 01:08.900]  I almost stabbed myself with scissors, but I got him!
[01:10.420 --> 01:11.320]  You alright, Edison?
[01:11.920 --> 01:12.720]  You alright there?
[01:13.580 --> 01:14.860]  He's so suicidal.
[01:18.440 --> 01:19.880]  He's like a bull.
[01:20.120 --> 01:21.620]  So, Gavin, what is the gumbler?
[01:21.800 --> 01:23.080]  It's a gummy gumbler.
[01:23.220 --> 01:23.460]  Okay.
[01:23.580 --> 01:25.720]  So I thought we could melt down some gummy bears.
[01:25.800 --> 01:26.020]  Okay.
[01:26.260 --> 01:26.600]  Obviously.
[01:26.840 --> 01:27.060]  Uh-huh.
[01:27.400 --> 01:30.680]  And, uh, somehow form this into, like, a big gummy cup.
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.260]  We got some molds for some smaller ones.
[01:33.260 --> 01:37.580]  And we may end up with some big gummy splashes all over the kitchen by accident.
[01:37.580 --> 01:41.580]  Yeah, so what we got is green gummy bears and purple gummy bears.
[01:41.980 --> 01:43.460]  Oh, I forgot to get a ladle.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.760]  That was on my list.
[01:46.400 --> 01:47.160]  Where's the list?
[01:47.560 --> 01:49.360]  It's in a trash can out front of Target.
[01:49.480 --> 01:51.560]  And you threw that away after you bought everything?
[01:51.780 --> 01:54.180]  No, I threw it away before I went in on accident.
[01:54.320 --> 01:55.100]  Aw, yeah, that'll do it.
[01:55.160 --> 01:57.720]  Okay, so these are the grape gummies.
[01:58.400 --> 02:00.040]  They're kind of brown, but maybe they'll be-
[02:00.040 --> 02:02.180]  Okay, but the other bag is also grape, isn't it?
[02:02.180 --> 02:06.520]  Uh, what that is is I accidentally ordered a one-pound bag.
[02:06.900 --> 02:08.320]  And then I saw that I'd ordered it.
[02:08.500 --> 02:10.400]  And I went and got the five-pound and the five-pound.
[02:10.480 --> 02:11.820]  I guess I forgot to un-one-pound.
[02:12.000 --> 02:12.600]  Well, there's green.
[02:12.760 --> 02:14.160]  Was that before or after you threw the list away?
[02:14.580 --> 02:15.320]  That was before.
[02:16.200 --> 02:19.000]  Okay, so I think what we should do, we'll melt down one color first.
[02:19.540 --> 02:21.640]  We'll do some bottom-half pours.
[02:22.160 --> 02:22.980]  Then work on the second one.
[02:22.980 --> 02:24.120]  Because we want to ombre it, right?
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.020]  Yeah, and I feel like if it's all liquid going in at first, right?
[02:27.220 --> 02:30.680]  If they're both liquid, they'll just mix into a brown paste.
[02:30.800 --> 02:30.920]  Right.
[02:30.920 --> 02:34.660]  But if we let one of them set a little bit first, we'll get the gradient.
[02:35.120 --> 02:36.720]  So do we want to do them both in that? Is that what you're saying?
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.960]  Yeah, we'll do one in this and one in the other one.
[02:39.100 --> 02:40.520]  So not the opposite of what I said.
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.500]  No, but we can give it time.
[02:43.180 --> 02:44.480]  That way it simmers, they're both ready.
[02:44.580 --> 02:46.400]  When one hardens a little bit, the other one's ready to go.
[02:47.520 --> 02:48.340]  Why waste time?
[02:48.480 --> 02:48.980]  You got scissors.
[02:49.640 --> 02:53.420]  God damn, does this stuff smell intensely of the color it is.
[02:53.440 --> 02:55.280]  Well, once we start pouring them in, maybe we'll probably...
[02:55.280 --> 02:55.940]  So this is green.
[02:56.080 --> 02:56.580]  Let's do some green.
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.100]  Do we want green at the bottom or the top?
[02:58.500 --> 02:59.180]  Green's at the top.
[03:02.280 --> 03:03.080]  Geoff, take care of those.
[03:04.360 --> 03:05.360]  I'll be honest with you.
[03:06.420 --> 03:07.780]  It doesn't taste as good as it smells.
[03:08.160 --> 03:08.400]  Really?
[03:08.680 --> 03:10.780]  Oh man, what a bummer.
[03:12.360 --> 03:13.300]  Tastes like a candle.
[03:14.940 --> 03:17.000]  Doesn't say the melting temperature.
[03:17.880 --> 03:18.140]  Right?
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.180]  Bro, green sucks.
[03:20.940 --> 03:21.600]  I don't mind grape.
[03:21.700 --> 03:22.480]  Oh, grape's good.
[03:22.680 --> 03:23.060]  Grape's good?
[03:23.260 --> 03:23.620]  Grape's good.
[03:24.260 --> 03:25.100]  Are you alright?
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.260]  Those taste like a treat.
[03:27.920 --> 03:31.060]  So that means if you take a bite of the Gunpla, you're going to get the bad flavor first.
[03:31.060 --> 03:31.840]  Try the green.
[03:32.000 --> 03:33.180]  Green is the color of treat.
[03:33.180 --> 03:34.120]  I don't want to eat any of these.
[03:34.360 --> 03:34.480]  Why not?
[03:34.480 --> 03:35.020]  Too bad!
[03:35.240 --> 03:35.580]  Try the green.
[03:35.680 --> 03:36.300]  This is your idea.
[03:36.660 --> 03:37.260]  Oh man.
[03:38.840 --> 03:39.580]  You don't like sugar?
[03:43.730 --> 03:44.790]  Oh, that tastes like...
[03:44.790 --> 03:45.670]  It tastes like a candle.
[03:45.870 --> 03:46.750]  It tastes like an ingredient.
[03:46.850 --> 03:49.250]  It has almost like a cinnamon.
[03:49.410 --> 03:49.730]  Try it, Nick.
[03:49.750 --> 03:50.630]  It has almost like a cinnamon.
[03:50.630 --> 03:51.910]  It does have almost like a cinnamon.
[03:54.190 --> 03:55.570]  Hang on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:56.810 --> 03:57.810]  Andrew, get a load of...
[03:57.810 --> 03:59.190]  Out of the frying pan and...
[03:59.190 --> 04:00.370]  Well, I guess into the pan.
[04:02.770 --> 04:03.530]  He's eating some.
[04:03.670 --> 04:04.290]  He's nom, nom, nom.
[04:05.850 --> 04:06.430]  Uh, okay.
[04:07.330 --> 04:07.730]  Now...
[04:07.730 --> 04:08.050]  And hey.
[04:08.090 --> 04:08.930]  What the f...
[04:08.930 --> 04:10.110]  Gavin, for f...
[04:10.110 --> 04:11.170]  What the fuck is wrong...
[04:11.170 --> 04:12.710]  He didn't even do anything this time.
[04:12.730 --> 04:13.190]  Damn it.
[04:14.830 --> 04:15.430]  I didn't like it.
[04:15.430 --> 04:16.330]  You gotta, you gotta...
[04:16.330 --> 04:16.990]  Didn't like it.
[04:17.350 --> 04:18.570]  There's no fan above it.
[04:18.950 --> 04:19.570]  Probably want to go like...
[04:19.570 --> 04:20.330]  There is no fan above it.
[04:20.330 --> 04:21.090]  Probably want to go like medium.
[04:21.370 --> 04:23.690]  Are you allowed gas without an extractor?
[04:23.970 --> 04:25.130]  He's gonna gas us.
[04:25.190 --> 04:25.630]  We'll die.
[04:25.790 --> 04:26.390]  This isn't England.
[04:26.510 --> 04:28.870]  We should get a carbon monoxide...
[04:28.870 --> 04:30.170]  There's like nothing to worry about.
[04:30.350 --> 04:30.510]  Oh.
[04:32.970 --> 04:34.750]  Did you get gloves or mitts or anything?
[04:35.030 --> 04:35.070]  Of course.
[04:35.170 --> 04:35.590]  He got gloves.
[04:35.690 --> 04:36.750]  Oh, he got gloves.
[04:36.930 --> 04:37.630]  Oh, wow.
[04:37.970 --> 04:38.370]  Those...
[04:38.370 --> 04:38.950]  Nice.
[04:39.590 --> 04:40.310]  Get them in there, Gavin.
[04:42.110 --> 04:42.790]  I'm sorry, Nick.
[04:42.790 --> 04:43.310]  No, you're fine.
[04:43.350 --> 04:43.710]  You're fine.
[04:45.370 --> 04:49.790]  Luckily, you have the added value of an opening between the fridge and the oven.
[04:51.630 --> 04:55.850]  You know, Millie, if you ever want to give up on college and work with the family business,
[04:55.970 --> 04:57.770]  you should be melting gummy bears right now.
[04:58.030 --> 04:59.090]  I have a degree.
[04:59.950 --> 05:00.610]  I do too.
[05:01.050 --> 05:01.350]  I don't.
[05:01.350 --> 05:02.970]  Hey, no degrees.
[05:03.370 --> 05:03.910]  All right.
[05:04.850 --> 05:06.250]  Lines in broadcast journalism.
[05:06.930 --> 05:08.330]  I think they missed their high five.
[05:10.050 --> 05:11.790]  Really a connection on the thumb, though.
[05:12.050 --> 05:12.210]  Yeah.
[05:12.750 --> 05:13.910]  Millie, you want a green gummy bear?
[05:14.450 --> 05:15.170]  They're terrible.
[05:15.330 --> 05:15.550]  You want one?
[05:15.970 --> 05:16.350]  You don't...
[05:17.670 --> 05:19.350]  It tastes like the way a candle smells.
[05:19.770 --> 05:21.010]  Yeah, I'd like your review on this.
[05:21.190 --> 05:21.290]  Yeah.
[05:21.830 --> 05:22.470]  Your nails look cool.
[05:22.950 --> 05:26.630]  I gotta tell you, Millicent, I cannot wait to read your autobiography someday.
[05:26.630 --> 05:26.850]  See?
[05:27.090 --> 05:27.330]  See?
[05:27.970 --> 05:28.830]  It has...
[05:28.830 --> 05:29.950]  It tastes like a tree.
[05:29.950 --> 05:32.210]  It tastes like floor cleaner or something.
[05:32.230 --> 05:32.630]  It does.
[05:32.690 --> 05:33.630]  It does taste like floor cleaner.
[05:33.750 --> 05:34.550]  Oh, my God.
[05:34.550 --> 05:36.890]  This is insane.
[05:39.430 --> 05:39.770]  Ow!
[05:39.950 --> 05:40.850]  Oh, God!
[05:40.970 --> 05:41.270]  Andrew!
[05:42.410 --> 05:42.850]  Jesus!
[05:42.990 --> 05:43.770]  It's so stringy.
[05:43.770 --> 05:45.130]  Andrew, I wanted to see closer.
[05:45.150 --> 05:46.830]  It looks like something from a horror movie.
[05:48.390 --> 05:49.610]  Okay, stop eating it!
[05:49.730 --> 05:50.810]  Oh, is this the substance?
[05:51.070 --> 05:51.970]  Yeah, this is the substance.
[05:52.090 --> 05:53.190]  This is going to make me hot.
[05:53.510 --> 05:57.290]  I'm now really worried that I'm wearing shorts because of the splashage.
[05:57.870 --> 05:58.370]  Check it out.
[05:58.490 --> 05:59.070]  It's got molten lava.
[05:59.070 --> 05:59.570]  Lava.
[05:59.790 --> 06:00.250]  Oh, you know what?
[06:00.410 --> 06:01.910]  Hey, Andrew, does this look like the substance?
[06:05.730 --> 06:06.370]  Good Lord.
[06:07.330 --> 06:09.210]  Let's get a look at this double arm action.
[06:11.810 --> 06:12.450]  Hey, Andrew Kale.
[06:14.310 --> 06:15.710]  Wow, this is really coming together!
[06:15.890 --> 06:16.130]  Whoa!
[06:16.970 --> 06:17.510]  Easy peasy.
[06:17.730 --> 06:21.150]  I gotta say, man, when you pitched this, I thought there was no fucking chance this was going to work.
[06:21.190 --> 06:21.850]  Oh, you're a fool!
[06:21.850 --> 06:22.690]  It's not the same thing.
[06:22.790 --> 06:23.550]  Have some faith.
[06:23.910 --> 06:24.230]  No!
[06:24.550 --> 06:26.630]  Gotta have faith, the faith, the faith.
[06:26.910 --> 06:27.350]  Oh, who's it?
[06:27.770 --> 06:28.210]  Dude, hell yeah.
[06:28.210 --> 06:28.690]  Get one biscuit.
[06:29.010 --> 06:29.230]  Yeah!
[06:29.870 --> 06:30.610]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:30.790 --> 06:33.010]  Now, I think purples are pretty much...
[06:33.010 --> 06:33.530]  Pretty there.
[06:33.670 --> 06:33.970]  They ready?
[06:34.110 --> 06:34.610]  Almost there.
[06:34.790 --> 06:35.910]  And we'll just get the dredge...
[06:35.910 --> 06:36.710]  Should we turn down the heat a little bit?
[06:36.710 --> 06:37.630]  No, no, keep it going.
[06:37.730 --> 06:39.190]  We want it to be as liquid as...
[06:39.190 --> 06:39.690]  Keep it going until it fully melts, yeah.
[06:39.890 --> 06:40.550]  You know, liquid.
[06:40.750 --> 06:42.050]  I'm just going to work the edges of this.
[06:42.070 --> 06:43.010]  I'm just going to sit in the middle of the back seat.
[06:43.210 --> 06:44.430]  We've clearly got a heat zone in the middle.
[06:44.550 --> 06:45.170]  Oh, we're boiling!
[06:45.930 --> 06:46.290]  Uh-oh.
[06:46.410 --> 06:46.590]  Uh-oh.
[06:46.590 --> 06:46.870]  Uh-oh.
[06:46.890 --> 06:47.070]  Uh-oh.
[06:47.250 --> 06:47.410]  Uh-oh.
[06:47.590 --> 06:47.750]  Uh-oh.
[06:48.190 --> 06:48.410]  Uh-oh.
[06:57.610 --> 06:58.170]  Uh-oh.
[06:58.890 --> 07:00.030]  These might recover.
[07:00.190 --> 07:00.830]  No, they're going to be fine.
[07:00.890 --> 07:02.230]  But what about just slabs of metal?
[07:02.510 --> 07:03.210]  Yeah, that might work too.
[07:03.550 --> 07:04.110]  Purple's ready!
[07:04.410 --> 07:05.030]  Oh, wow.
[07:05.630 --> 07:06.050]  That's wonderful.
[07:06.290 --> 07:07.750]  Oh, yeah, that looks really good.
[07:07.830 --> 07:08.190]  That's slop.
[07:08.310 --> 07:09.650]  This is gray like a Gerpler.
[07:09.990 --> 07:11.650]  Can you fill out a quick risk assessment?
[07:11.730 --> 07:13.170]  Can I move out of this area real fast?
[07:13.170 --> 07:13.490]  Yeah.
[07:13.830 --> 07:14.870]  When does our insurance take effect?
[07:15.810 --> 07:18.150]  For the ultimate, we will do...
[07:18.150 --> 07:18.430]  Wow!
[07:18.730 --> 07:20.110]  I mean, that's going to be a great...
[07:20.110 --> 07:21.090]  That's going to be the best one.
[07:21.430 --> 07:22.130]  Should we grease it?
[07:22.130 --> 07:22.830]  That's great.
[07:23.750 --> 07:24.470]  That's what we want.
[07:24.470 --> 07:24.650]  Yeah, should we...
[07:24.650 --> 07:26.270]  Do we olive oil the...
[07:26.270 --> 07:27.190]  Do we have olive oil?
[07:27.190 --> 07:27.610]  No.
[07:29.150 --> 07:30.090]  Is that on Geoff's list?
[07:30.210 --> 07:30.470]  No.
[07:31.190 --> 07:33.050]  Hey, let's give Gavin a lot of room.
[07:33.390 --> 07:33.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:34.230 --> 07:34.930]  That sounds great.
[07:35.310 --> 07:36.130]  All right, first pour.
[07:36.370 --> 07:36.690]  Okay.
[07:36.910 --> 07:37.410]  A little shot.
[07:37.510 --> 07:38.310]  It's a pants day, huh?
[07:39.410 --> 07:39.730]  Yeah.
[07:39.810 --> 07:41.190]  Yeah, shorts were a bad choice.
[07:41.330 --> 07:41.530]  Yep.
[07:41.710 --> 07:42.230]  I agree.
[07:43.490 --> 07:44.930]  We'll just do a full purple on this.
[07:45.050 --> 07:45.370]  Okay.
[07:45.510 --> 07:46.090]  Look at this.
[07:46.750 --> 07:47.290]  Pretty good.
[07:47.410 --> 07:48.570]  I'm judging with my eyes.
[07:48.650 --> 07:50.230]  Is it going to melt the...
[07:50.230 --> 07:50.710]  Yeah, maybe.
[07:50.910 --> 07:51.250]  But we'll see.
[07:51.250 --> 07:52.970]  No, I mean the...
[07:52.970 --> 07:54.470]  It's designed for this.
[07:54.550 --> 07:54.790]  Okay.
[07:55.210 --> 07:55.870]  Andrew, you want to see?
[07:57.570 --> 07:59.450]  Oh, look at that.
[07:59.550 --> 07:59.830]  Uh-oh.
[08:00.530 --> 08:01.030]  Uh-oh.
[08:01.230 --> 08:01.550]  Uh-oh.
[08:01.650 --> 08:01.810]  Okay.
[08:02.190 --> 08:02.410]  Okay.
[08:04.510 --> 08:04.870]  Then...
[08:05.390 --> 08:07.170]  Should we just go straight into the girt for the big one?
[08:07.290 --> 08:07.470]  Yeah.
[08:08.190 --> 08:08.770]  Might as well.
[08:08.930 --> 08:10.290]  So I'll pour maybe like a third.
[08:10.810 --> 08:11.010]  Okay.
[08:11.090 --> 08:13.350]  Because the cup will displace a lot.
[08:13.590 --> 08:13.730]  Right.
[08:13.810 --> 08:14.550]  Do you think the cup will melt?
[08:15.070 --> 08:15.330]  Yeah.
[08:15.470 --> 08:16.790]  That's probably good.
[08:17.550 --> 08:17.950]  You think?
[08:17.990 --> 08:18.750]  Good lord.
[08:19.290 --> 08:19.670]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:19.890 --> 08:21.290]  Straight to the bottom.
[08:22.650 --> 08:23.930]  Yeah, push it in just a little.
[08:24.550 --> 08:24.910]  Yeah.
[08:24.950 --> 08:25.550]  There you go.
[08:26.870 --> 08:27.710]  Pretty good.
[08:28.130 --> 08:28.730]  You're good.
[08:28.850 --> 08:30.210]  Yeah, it's trying to escape.
[08:30.330 --> 08:30.710]  It's like, no!
[08:30.730 --> 08:31.510]  Yeah, try and keep it central.
[08:32.290 --> 08:34.730]  Do not spill on me.
[08:34.730 --> 08:35.430]  Oh, god.
[08:35.950 --> 08:36.750]  Can I get...
[08:37.290 --> 08:38.290]  Let me adjust to you.
[08:38.330 --> 08:38.910]  Is that good?
[08:39.190 --> 08:40.370]  Is this bad one for you?
[08:40.590 --> 08:42.250]  It's so much harder to pour than the other one.
[08:42.470 --> 08:42.770]  Let's see.
[08:42.810 --> 08:43.270]  Oh, boy.
[08:43.410 --> 08:43.630]  Okay.
[08:43.950 --> 08:45.250]  Oh, shit.
[08:45.990 --> 08:46.370]  Oh.
[08:46.630 --> 08:47.290]  Oh, no!
[08:47.370 --> 08:47.930]  The substance!
[08:49.190 --> 08:50.070]  Oh, god.
[08:51.330 --> 08:52.210]  Oh, shit.
[08:52.350 --> 08:53.050]  Pull it back!
[08:53.110 --> 08:53.450]  Too much!
[08:53.490 --> 08:53.970]  Too much!
[08:53.970 --> 08:55.890]  Get in there.
[08:58.670 --> 08:59.770]  Alright, let's turn it.
[09:00.070 --> 09:00.750]  Turn the whole thing.
[09:00.990 --> 09:01.550]  The whole device.
[09:02.770 --> 09:03.350]  That's it.
[09:03.970 --> 09:04.750]  Get this in there.
[09:05.650 --> 09:06.570]  Yeah, lean back.
[09:06.710 --> 09:07.010]  Lean over.
[09:09.410 --> 09:10.210]  And then...
[09:10.870 --> 09:11.270]  Okay.
[09:12.330 --> 09:12.730]  Okay.
[09:12.870 --> 09:13.550]  Now we'll just...
[09:13.550 --> 09:15.710]  Now pour a couple of shot glasses.
[09:15.870 --> 09:16.250]  You know what I mean?
[09:16.350 --> 09:16.550]  Yep.
[09:16.850 --> 09:16.990]  Yep.
[09:17.410 --> 09:17.730]  Shit.
[09:17.910 --> 09:18.110]  Yep.
[09:18.190 --> 09:18.530]  Here you go.
[09:20.030 --> 09:20.350]  Oh!
[09:25.250 --> 09:25.570]  Careful!
[09:25.850 --> 09:26.890]  You'll contaminate purple!
[09:27.490 --> 09:27.890]  That's good.
[09:27.930 --> 09:28.390]  You want that.
[09:28.550 --> 09:28.730]  Okay.
[09:29.490 --> 09:29.710]  Oh, yeah.
[09:29.830 --> 09:31.350]  Now go half to the next one.
[09:31.990 --> 09:34.310]  Because then we can get some purple on that and see if maybe it works.
[09:34.450 --> 09:34.610]  Yep.
[09:35.490 --> 09:35.930]  Oh, god.
[09:36.070 --> 09:36.550]  Oh, scissors.
[09:36.810 --> 09:37.390]  Get those out of there.
[09:38.490 --> 09:40.430]  And then we'll fill this one with that full purple.
[09:41.930 --> 09:43.250]  I mean, this is only attempt one.
[09:43.590 --> 09:47.390]  I wish I had, like, a heavy weight or something I could put in the bottom of this so I don't
[09:47.390 --> 09:48.010]  have to hold it.
[09:48.090 --> 09:48.390]  Yeah.
[09:48.390 --> 09:49.670]  Just on your shoulder.
[09:50.290 --> 09:50.560]  Mm-hmm.
[09:51.950 --> 09:53.450]  You guys do anything like this in college?
[09:55.070 --> 09:57.050]  Uh, arts and crafts?
[09:57.250 --> 09:57.410]  No.
[09:58.670 --> 10:00.150]  I mean, maybe in chemistry?
[10:00.530 --> 10:01.530]  Andrew, I'm going to move you real quick.
[10:01.610 --> 10:03.090]  I don't have that.
[10:03.290 --> 10:03.850]  I don't have that.
[10:04.090 --> 10:05.930]  No, no, no, no, no.
[10:06.230 --> 10:06.410]  Okay.
[10:06.830 --> 10:09.470]  Andrew, do not get gummed up in the works, dude.
[10:09.570 --> 10:10.750]  Do not go in the goo, Andrew.
[10:11.610 --> 10:12.070]  Hey, it rhymed.
[10:12.470 --> 10:12.850]  Good.
[10:13.210 --> 10:14.530]  Has this possibly worked?
[10:14.850 --> 10:15.770]  I'll try to do a transfer.
[10:16.050 --> 10:17.110]  That was perfectly in Eric's way.
[10:17.830 --> 10:18.570]  There you go.
[10:18.790 --> 10:19.610]  Nicely done.
[10:19.730 --> 10:22.130]  Yeah, see, now we can...
[10:22.130 --> 10:23.670]  Maybe it'll also cool it faster.
[10:23.690 --> 10:24.510]  I want to touch it.
[10:24.910 --> 10:26.590]  Okay, it's hot in the big pool.
[10:27.110 --> 10:28.450]  Small pool, not hot.
[10:28.590 --> 10:28.790]  Okay.
[10:29.750 --> 10:30.190]  Mmm!
[10:30.790 --> 10:31.870]  Tastes fucking awful.
[10:33.770 --> 10:35.090]  Oh, it tastes so bad.
[10:35.590 --> 10:35.990]  That's it.
[10:36.190 --> 10:36.590]  Oh.
[10:37.690 --> 10:38.070]  Oh.
[10:38.350 --> 10:38.930]  The substance.
[10:39.390 --> 10:39.950]  Oh, it burns.
[10:40.050 --> 10:40.510]  Andrew, careful!
[10:41.870 --> 10:43.370]  Oh, it feels horrific.
[10:46.510 --> 10:50.550]  I don't know that another...
[10:55.030 --> 10:56.550]  The can doesn't really want to stay.
[10:57.290 --> 10:58.230]  I don't want to get in those screws.
[10:59.330 --> 11:00.230]  You want to grab it?
[11:00.550 --> 11:00.670]  I can't.
[11:00.670 --> 11:01.410]  I have the hardware.
[11:01.870 --> 11:03.210]  You went to the middle, though!
[11:04.250 --> 11:04.970]  Here's cheese.
[11:05.470 --> 11:07.190]  This is why we had to stop filming at my house.
[11:08.410 --> 11:09.490]  Oh, yeah, your counter.
[11:09.990 --> 11:10.170]  Yeah.
[11:11.190 --> 11:11.490]  Is it?
[11:11.630 --> 11:12.010]  I don't know.
[11:12.150 --> 11:12.570]  The trash?
[11:12.590 --> 11:13.870]  Are you holding it?
[11:13.950 --> 11:14.310]  Oh!
[11:14.590 --> 11:14.950]  Andrew!
[11:15.550 --> 11:15.770]  No.
[11:15.770 --> 11:17.230]  Andrew, you maniac.
[11:19.930 --> 11:21.550]  You gummed up your works.
[11:22.570 --> 11:24.270]  That was a mistake.
[11:25.450 --> 11:27.050]  That's an expensive mistake, buddy.
[11:28.170 --> 11:29.150]  Will you pick him up?
[11:31.470 --> 11:32.970]  Hey, now he can drive up the walls.
[11:33.610 --> 11:33.830]  Oh!
[11:34.670 --> 11:35.730]  You spider-man-ed yourself.
[11:35.910 --> 11:37.750]  Yeah, he's got a spider-man himself.
[11:38.890 --> 11:39.810]  Here, have him help you.
[11:45.850 --> 11:46.610]  Find yourself?
[11:47.650 --> 11:49.850]  I feel like I cut myself somehow.
[11:51.090 --> 11:53.410]  We haven't done one of these without blood for a long time.
[11:54.230 --> 11:54.550]  Yep.
[11:54.830 --> 11:55.770]  Oh, that's...
[11:59.050 --> 12:00.710]  Maybe you shouldn't have said that before this.
[12:01.530 --> 12:02.250]  It's hot today.
[12:09.730 --> 12:10.610]  Oh, yeah.
[12:12.190 --> 12:13.690]  I will say this about the new house.
[12:14.030 --> 12:15.590]  Hot water is fucking hot.
[12:15.610 --> 12:16.370]  So hot.
[12:16.750 --> 12:18.190]  The hot water is so hot.
[12:18.610 --> 12:19.910]  Geoff, I'm impressed.
[12:19.910 --> 12:24.810]  I gotta say, I didn't think there was a fucking chance in hell you were getting that together like that.
[12:24.870 --> 12:25.610]  It's pretty good.
[12:26.070 --> 12:29.990]  Listen, I got 19 years of parenthood in me.
[12:30.890 --> 12:33.350]  Millie has made some messes in her life.
[12:33.750 --> 12:34.110]  Millie!
[12:35.070 --> 12:35.910]  Worse than that.
[12:36.730 --> 12:38.190]  Not in a while, but...
[12:38.190 --> 12:40.050]  Did you build a bunch of gummy bears and put them into cups?
[12:40.070 --> 12:40.310]  No.
[12:41.010 --> 12:42.470]  What's the next step for this?
[12:43.390 --> 12:44.650]  Film doughnuts, come back to it?
[12:45.530 --> 12:48.390]  Is that what we gotta do? We have to film something else, then come back to this?
[12:48.390 --> 12:50.810]  I think it's got to set for like an hour or something.
[12:51.130 --> 12:52.110]  Time equals cold.
[12:52.290 --> 12:53.190]  Can we try frozen popcorn?
[12:53.710 --> 12:53.890]  Yeah.
[12:54.130 --> 12:55.230]  Can that be part of this video?
[12:55.330 --> 12:57.370]  Can we just put frozen popcorn in the middle of this video?
[12:57.690 --> 12:59.190]  Can we just not stop and eat frozen popcorn?
[12:59.450 --> 13:03.490]  I saw on TikTok that if you put popcorn in the freezer after you pop it,
[13:03.890 --> 13:06.810]  supposedly you don't get kernels in your teeth when you eat popcorn.
[13:06.950 --> 13:07.450]  It's pretty good.
[13:08.410 --> 13:08.770]  So...
[13:08.770 --> 13:10.650]  It honestly doesn't even taste cold.
[13:12.270 --> 13:13.290]  It's been in the freezer all night.
[13:13.990 --> 13:15.430]  There's very little liquid in it, I guess.
[13:15.590 --> 13:15.830]  Water.
[13:16.210 --> 13:17.330]  I think it's still stuck a little bit.
[13:17.330 --> 13:18.230]  Yeah, I got one.
[13:18.790 --> 13:19.470]  I'm fine.
[13:20.450 --> 13:22.290]  But it doesn't taste any fucking different either.
[13:23.250 --> 13:25.150]  Like, if you hadn't told me this was frozen, I wouldn't know.
[13:25.630 --> 13:26.330]  Milly, you want to try it?
[13:29.530 --> 13:30.210]  It's just...
[13:30.210 --> 13:30.550]  Popcorn.
[13:31.470 --> 13:31.810]  Like...
[13:31.810 --> 13:34.010]  I would say cold popcorn, but it's not even really cold.
[13:34.270 --> 13:35.250]  It makes my mouth feel weird.
[13:35.270 --> 13:37.970]  Because it's kind of cold, but not really, it just makes me think it's stale.
[13:38.430 --> 13:38.750]  Like it's old.
[13:39.430 --> 13:39.630]  Yeah.
[13:41.110 --> 13:41.810]  Go to town.
[13:43.790 --> 13:44.910]  For God's sake.
[13:45.730 --> 13:46.170]  Seal him in.
[13:46.170 --> 13:46.710]  Seal him in.
[13:47.210 --> 13:47.470]  Seal him in.
[13:49.330 --> 13:49.950]  Freeze him.
[13:50.070 --> 13:50.450]  Freeze him.
[13:50.510 --> 13:51.490]  You won't scare me again.
[13:51.990 --> 13:52.770]  Get him in there.
[13:56.130 --> 13:57.790]  Get in the freezer, you little popcorn bitch.
[13:57.850 --> 13:58.590]  You little sumbitch.
[14:00.170 --> 14:04.130]  It's the second time we've used him and he's already frozen in a bag of popcorn.
[14:05.130 --> 14:07.030]  Every time we use him, he ends up in the freezer.
[14:08.790 --> 14:09.490]  It's really not good.
[14:11.430 --> 14:12.490]  Think about what you did.
[14:12.490 --> 14:16.250]  Do you feel like any of it got stuck in your teeth?
[14:19.170 --> 14:21.210]  It is so much better.
[14:35.610 --> 14:36.710]  Oh shit.
[14:36.930 --> 14:37.410]  Oh Christ.
[14:37.830 --> 14:38.650]  Oh my God.
[14:39.870 --> 14:41.710]  I'm surprised his wheels are still good.
[14:42.490 --> 14:43.070]  I cleaned them off.
[14:43.150 --> 14:43.410]  Oh you did?
[14:43.450 --> 14:43.930]  Oh nice!
[14:44.090 --> 14:44.970]  Yeah, I cleaned them off.
[14:45.690 --> 14:46.050]  Wow.
[14:46.510 --> 14:46.950]  There you go.
[14:47.310 --> 14:50.790]  Alright, we'll see you back here in just a little bit for the next one.
[14:55.240 --> 14:57.500]  With six or seven hundred hits though, you might do it.
[15:11.820 --> 15:13.720]  And five minutes have passed.
[15:14.900 --> 15:17.040]  In those five minutes, I've changed my shirt.
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.640]  I think I changed my shorts probably.
[15:18.760 --> 15:19.160]  Oh nice.
[15:19.340 --> 15:20.360]  Eric, you look the same I think.
[15:21.060 --> 15:22.140]  Your mood has changed, Eric.
[15:22.140 --> 15:23.320]  Welcome back to Cat Piss House.
[15:23.500 --> 15:24.280]  This is...
[15:24.280 --> 15:25.300]  He's been in a mood.
[15:25.680 --> 15:26.420]  This has been...
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.300]  Why is Eric in a mood?
[15:27.380 --> 15:29.260]  I'm not in a mood, I'm just having fun at Cat Piss House.
[15:30.300 --> 15:33.340]  This has been a day that we've been waiting for to film.
[15:33.820 --> 15:35.280]  The Gumplers?
[15:36.240 --> 15:36.680]  Gumblers?
[15:36.900 --> 15:37.280]  Gumplers.
[15:37.480 --> 15:40.280]  The Gumplers have been in the freezer.
[15:40.560 --> 15:41.160]  And the fridge.
[15:41.480 --> 15:42.980]  We built them on Friday.
[15:43.180 --> 15:44.580]  Today is Wednesday.
[15:46.140 --> 15:47.020]  Oh wow.
[15:47.100 --> 15:49.360]  This looks like a Zelda villain.
[15:49.900 --> 15:51.200]  Alright, let's crack out some...
[15:53.020 --> 15:54.900]  It's so cold and sticky!
[15:55.500 --> 15:56.760]  Well don't put it directly...
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.820]  It's like freezing glue.
[16:00.560 --> 16:01.800]  It is like very cold glue.
[16:02.800 --> 16:03.660]  That's hazardous.
[16:04.160 --> 16:05.240]  This one's perfect.
[16:06.200 --> 16:07.360]  That's pretty cool.
[16:07.660 --> 16:09.420]  But this one's...
[16:09.420 --> 16:11.280]  That one's like...
[16:11.280 --> 16:12.480]  You know what, this one...
[16:12.480 --> 16:14.120]  Alright, so this one has perfect form.
[16:14.260 --> 16:16.380]  This is a purple Gumpler.
[16:16.740 --> 16:17.480]  We've got a green Gumpler.
[16:17.620 --> 16:19.000]  But this mix, this ombre works perfectly.
[16:19.000 --> 16:20.140]  That's a gurple Gumpler.
[16:20.140 --> 16:21.560]  So wait, why did we freeze them?
[16:21.660 --> 16:22.480]  Because they're not very gummy.
[16:24.140 --> 16:25.140]  Why did we freeze them?
[16:25.200 --> 16:26.240]  Yeah, that's cold and they're gummy.
[16:26.500 --> 16:29.380]  Because the idea was to do this right away.
[16:29.840 --> 16:32.820]  And then we left for four or five days.
[16:33.060 --> 16:33.740]  We could put them in the fridge.
[16:34.020 --> 16:34.800]  So now...
[16:34.800 --> 16:35.860]  But this was in the fridge.
[16:36.160 --> 16:37.800]  Okay, so this one should be gummy still.
[16:37.920 --> 16:38.380]  Ooh, it is.
[16:39.280 --> 16:40.280]  That's really gummy.
[16:41.080 --> 16:43.180]  I have a feeling this one's going to be really gummy in about eight minutes.
[16:43.300 --> 16:43.420]  Yeah.
[16:43.740 --> 16:44.120]  Oh shit.
[16:45.220 --> 16:45.440]  Oh.
[16:46.380 --> 16:48.420]  Wait, weren't we going to do like a warm water method?
[16:48.420 --> 16:51.040]  Well, I assume we take the can out first.
[16:51.600 --> 16:51.960]  Okay.
[16:51.980 --> 16:52.440]  Yeah, let's see it.
[16:52.480 --> 16:53.060]  Yeah, sounds good.
[16:54.680 --> 16:55.720]  Oh, god damn.
[16:56.140 --> 16:56.720]  All right, let's...
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.460]  We have the blazing hot heat.
[16:58.460 --> 16:59.900]  What are we going to put in this to drink out of?
[17:00.380 --> 17:00.740]  Sodas.
[17:01.580 --> 17:03.320]  I think we might have put Bovril in it.
[17:03.540 --> 17:03.780]  Oh.
[17:04.280 --> 17:04.780]  Did you break them?
[17:05.080 --> 17:05.320]  No.
[17:05.900 --> 17:06.560]  Do you have to regap them?
[17:07.860 --> 17:10.560]  No, I ran through all my Bovril already.
[17:10.620 --> 17:11.620]  We could nip to Fiesta.
[17:11.920 --> 17:13.360]  I forgot how bad these taste.
[17:13.420 --> 17:13.740]  Oh, yeah.
[17:13.880 --> 17:14.560]  Yeah, they're not great.
[17:15.080 --> 17:16.700]  Oh, we fucking ruined this Gurpler.
[17:19.200 --> 17:20.220]  Oh, you put...
[17:21.060 --> 17:21.700]  I didn't.
[17:21.740 --> 17:22.460]  Don't say you put.
[17:22.500 --> 17:23.600]  I didn't do any of this.
[17:23.600 --> 17:24.240]  Who put this down?
[17:24.380 --> 17:25.300]  This was you and Eric.
[17:25.740 --> 17:26.800]  All right, we'll put it on that, right?
[17:28.400 --> 17:29.780]  I had nothing to do with this part.
[17:30.100 --> 17:30.360]  Oh.
[17:31.380 --> 17:31.740]  Oh.
[17:32.000 --> 17:32.640]  The substance.
[17:32.960 --> 17:33.880]  All right, did you put this down?
[17:35.080 --> 17:35.480]  Yeah, sure.
[17:35.880 --> 17:36.740]  You feel comfortable about it?
[17:36.820 --> 17:37.000]  Yeah.
[17:39.200 --> 17:39.560]  Here.
[17:39.980 --> 17:40.860]  It's your fucking experiment.
[17:40.960 --> 17:41.420]  You can do it.
[17:42.200 --> 17:42.460]  See?
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.380]  So worried about the outside, it comes right off.
[17:44.480 --> 17:45.600]  Just simple.
[17:46.000 --> 17:46.480]  And then...
[17:46.480 --> 17:47.020]  Baby mode.
[17:47.020 --> 17:48.580]  I think you might have to pour some...
[17:48.580 --> 17:49.780]  I think you gotta pour some down the middle.
[17:50.520 --> 17:51.260]  Now just get it.
[17:52.600 --> 17:54.080]  I told you something was gonna get hit.
[17:54.320 --> 17:55.100]  I fucking said it.
[17:56.280 --> 17:56.600]  Oops!
[17:56.780 --> 17:57.380]  That might be enough.
[17:59.780 --> 18:00.960]  You gotta do a little bit more.
[18:04.360 --> 18:05.000]  It's full.
[18:05.580 --> 18:09.500]  Do you think it would be easier if you opened the can and drained the soda out?
[18:10.420 --> 18:10.940]  Interesting idea.
[18:10.940 --> 18:12.420]  I think you should drink the soda from in there.
[18:12.440 --> 18:12.540]  Yeah.
[18:13.060 --> 18:14.020]  Crack it open, drink the soda.
[18:14.180 --> 18:14.880]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18:14.880 --> 18:15.860]  It's full of hot water.
[18:15.860 --> 18:17.020]  Pour the hot water out.
[18:17.020 --> 18:17.660]  Wait, wait, wait.
[18:17.940 --> 18:18.800]  Pour the hot water out.
[18:18.800 --> 18:20.500]  See if the hot water works before we do it.
[18:20.720 --> 18:21.140]  Yeah, I was seeing.
[18:21.500 --> 18:22.000]  Everyone yelled.
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.220]  I was just seeing if it was loosening up.
[18:23.760 --> 18:24.480]  You looked like...
[18:24.480 --> 18:25.900]  It looked like he was going straight for the bottle.
[18:25.900 --> 18:27.000]  That's exactly what he's gonna do.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.700]  You were gonna drink it and get scalded.
[18:28.780 --> 18:31.860]  He was gonna do it, and then we told him to wait, and he looked at us like he couldn't
[18:31.860 --> 18:32.820]  understand what was happening.
[18:32.920 --> 18:33.480]  He was like, yeah.
[18:33.620 --> 18:34.280]  We saved you.
[18:35.120 --> 18:36.100]  We really gotta loosen this up.
[18:36.520 --> 18:38.100]  Alright, so let's...
[18:38.100 --> 18:39.480]  Me and Geoff will both drink some soda.
[18:39.580 --> 18:40.800]  Just dump out the hot water.
[18:41.520 --> 18:42.020]  He didn't.
[18:42.100 --> 18:42.380]  I know.
[18:42.560 --> 18:43.720]  He did what you were worried about me doing.
[18:43.740 --> 18:44.320]  Yeah, 100%.
[18:45.920 --> 18:48.260]  He's a company of single-focused men.
[18:48.360 --> 18:50.360]  He did what you were worried about me doing.
[18:50.740 --> 18:50.940]  Cheers.
[18:51.240 --> 18:51.520]  Cheers.
[18:55.320 --> 18:57.220]  That's like a turducken of Gurplers.
[18:57.480 --> 19:03.120]  The problem with drinking this is that it smells like the way the green gummies taste,
[19:03.440 --> 19:04.780]  and you can't escape it.
[19:04.880 --> 19:06.560]  You're ruining that flavor for yourself.
[19:06.720 --> 19:07.060]  It's bad.
[19:07.300 --> 19:08.820]  The flavor ruined the flavor.
[19:10.780 --> 19:11.860]  You see what I mean?
[19:11.980 --> 19:12.760]  You see what I mean?
[19:12.760 --> 19:14.240]  I 100% see what you mean.
[19:15.140 --> 19:19.300]  What's that shitty water you can drink, but you huff like a little ring of scent?
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.700]  Oh, oh, the, uh...
[19:21.700 --> 19:22.320]  Like Mio?
[19:22.460 --> 19:23.640]  Circle or some shit?
[19:23.800 --> 19:25.900]  Oh, yeah, the one that Adam Devine has commercials on.
[19:25.920 --> 19:26.320]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:27.240 --> 19:29.480]  But also, if you sponsor us, we like that.
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.080]  Yeah, we do.
[19:31.160 --> 19:31.880]  We're trying...
[19:31.880 --> 19:35.920]  He will, he will, because we're trying really hard to sell out.
[19:36.000 --> 19:36.180]  Yeah.
[19:37.420 --> 19:38.220]  Do you see what we're saying?
[19:38.400 --> 19:39.160]  It has the stink...
[19:39.160 --> 19:40.880]  Oh, I don't even like the original drink, though.
[19:41.060 --> 19:41.480]  Yeah, it's lime.
[19:42.020 --> 19:44.680]  This is gonna be half a can stuck in the bottom of a Gerpler.
[19:44.880 --> 19:48.400]  But, like, how are we gonna get the Gerplers separated?
[19:48.680 --> 19:49.560]  Well, with hot water.
[19:50.520 --> 19:51.160]  It works so well.
[19:51.180 --> 19:52.220]  We need the can out of there.
[19:52.500 --> 19:55.920]  How did the goo get in the middle cup?
[19:56.920 --> 19:58.140]  It's on the outside!
[19:58.580 --> 20:00.120]  No, but how is the can stuck in there?
[20:00.820 --> 20:02.420]  Pull it back! Too much, too much!
[20:02.540 --> 20:03.240]  Here, I got it out.
[20:04.040 --> 20:04.400]  Whoa!
[20:04.600 --> 20:04.960]  Hey!
[20:06.140 --> 20:06.940]  Way to go!
[20:07.120 --> 20:07.520]  Thank you.
[20:07.700 --> 20:08.280]  Nice job, Geoff.
[20:08.520 --> 20:09.080]  Oh, wow.
[20:09.840 --> 20:10.200]  Oh!
[20:10.200 --> 20:10.520]  Oh!
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.260]  It kind of sticks.
[20:13.140 --> 20:13.500]  Malleable...
[20:14.260 --> 20:14.620]  ...Gumplers.
[20:14.720 --> 20:15.000]  That's right.
[20:15.100 --> 20:16.280]  We gotta get some bufferl in there.
[20:16.460 --> 20:16.760]  Stat.
[20:17.480 --> 20:17.700]  Ah!
[20:18.780 --> 20:19.320]  Here you go.
[20:19.740 --> 20:20.100]  Glove.
[20:20.180 --> 20:22.960]  And the good news is, it'll be hot enough to make it right here in the sink.
[20:24.380 --> 20:26.780]  Hey, film the water in the middle there.
[20:28.380 --> 20:28.920]  What is that?
[20:29.040 --> 20:29.320]  Whoa.
[20:29.400 --> 20:29.920]  That's just heat.
[20:30.180 --> 20:30.420]  Yep.
[20:30.820 --> 20:33.900]  That's how the hot water is at this house.
[20:34.660 --> 20:35.180]  It's milk.
[20:35.460 --> 20:36.400]  Thank God I couldn't get it to work in the shower.
[20:36.400 --> 20:37.480]  It's so hot, it's milk.
[20:37.580 --> 20:37.720]  Yeah.
[20:37.880 --> 20:38.020]  Yeah.
[20:38.020 --> 20:39.080]  Nick had a shower here.
[20:39.560 --> 20:40.020]  Did you really?
[20:40.140 --> 20:41.800]  He took a shower here yesterday.
[20:42.100 --> 20:44.360]  When I turned the water on, it was brown water out of the pipe.
[20:44.940 --> 20:48.380]  So funny, too, because I was here yesterday, I would have been so confused if I walked in
[20:48.380 --> 20:49.300]  and he was in the middle of the shower.
[20:49.660 --> 20:53.600]  I mean, he comes in with the towel around his head, but he's like fucking shredded and
[20:53.600 --> 20:53.980]  jagged.
[20:54.100 --> 20:54.660]  He's like, what's up, man?
[20:54.680 --> 20:55.740]  He's hot, I can assure you.
[20:55.800 --> 20:56.020]  He's like, what's up?
[20:57.180 --> 20:57.460]  Ah!
[20:57.480 --> 20:57.760]  Ah!
[20:57.760 --> 20:58.440]  It's so hot!
[21:00.880 --> 21:02.960]  It is really hot, but it helps get the stinking stick off.
[21:02.960 --> 21:04.140]  My hands, the gloves do nothing.
[21:05.020 --> 21:06.560]  Okay, so maybe look a little bit at this.
[21:06.560 --> 21:07.840]  Maybe the outside there?
[21:08.380 --> 21:08.540]  Uh-huh.
[21:08.580 --> 21:09.300]  Oh, God.
[21:09.820 --> 21:11.780]  Aren't we gonna put it in a bowl and like dip it into it?
[21:11.780 --> 21:13.120]  It's like a heat umbrella he's making.
[21:14.420 --> 21:17.580]  Or, you know, get water all over the counter.
[21:17.940 --> 21:18.440]  I'm making what?
[21:18.760 --> 21:19.680]  You're doing a great job.
[21:19.720 --> 21:20.780]  You're making a video is what you're making.
[21:21.040 --> 21:21.900]  Don't you worry about it.
[21:25.200 --> 21:26.560]  Where is our toolbox?
[21:27.120 --> 21:27.620]  Our what?
[21:27.940 --> 21:28.640]  Our toolbox.
[21:29.960 --> 21:31.840]  So like, grab right here.
[21:32.460 --> 21:32.980]  Give that a rip.
[21:32.980 --> 21:33.480]  Oh!
[21:35.540 --> 21:36.600]  That sounded good.
[21:36.920 --> 21:37.520]  Was that normal?
[21:41.360 --> 21:43.100]  I tell you what though, that works.
[21:43.720 --> 21:44.780]  That's now off there.
[21:46.220 --> 21:46.500]  Ow!
[21:47.040 --> 21:47.300]  Ow!
[21:48.080 --> 21:48.840]  Damn, that's hot.
[21:49.440 --> 21:49.780]  Ooh!
[21:50.820 --> 21:51.260]  Ooh!
[21:51.660 --> 21:53.420]  You think this is what they're doing to Andrew's teeth right now?
[21:55.200 --> 21:57.200]  Yeah, Andrew can't be here today because he's at the dentist.
[22:02.770 --> 22:03.890]  Okay, I'm gonna get deep.
[22:03.890 --> 22:05.730]  I'm gonna pull against you.
[22:05.830 --> 22:06.650]  We'll just go for a pull.
[22:09.710 --> 22:10.090]  Okay.
[22:12.210 --> 22:12.590]  Whoa!
[22:12.710 --> 22:13.590]  See how shiny that is?
[22:13.650 --> 22:14.430]  Good lord.
[22:14.730 --> 22:15.650]  Dude, it's almost out.
[22:15.910 --> 22:16.530]  It's almost out.
[22:16.630 --> 22:18.630]  It looks like you're making a homemade fleshlight at this point.
[22:19.490 --> 22:20.730]  Do not shag this later.
[22:24.610 --> 22:26.690]  Oh, I was taking a shower.
[22:26.890 --> 22:28.110]  Yeah, now we know why you took the shower.
[22:28.470 --> 22:28.570]  No!
[22:29.370 --> 22:30.570]  I was too gummy.
[22:31.990 --> 22:33.330]  Leave a comment down below.
[22:33.470 --> 22:35.270]  What's Nick been nobbin' and what the...
[22:36.650 --> 22:39.350]  Yeah, when we've proved it can be done, we may...
[22:39.350 --> 22:47.130]  The full Gerpler experiment may require a little bit more testing.
[22:47.350 --> 22:47.550]  Yeah.
[22:47.690 --> 22:49.850]  But we've proven that it can be done.
[22:49.870 --> 22:51.190]  The ShotGumpler's a success.
[22:53.030 --> 22:56.710]  If they had bigger, like, molds, we would be fine.
[22:58.010 --> 23:00.550]  Oh dude, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it's coming.
[23:00.550 --> 23:00.950]  I see the head, I see the head.
[23:01.650 --> 23:02.410]  It's crowning.
[23:03.570 --> 23:04.410]  It's breached.
[23:07.010 --> 23:07.450]  Wow.
[23:08.990 --> 23:10.730]  Wow, he did it.
[23:11.330 --> 23:13.410]  Alright, and then we're done. We did it.
[23:13.430 --> 23:13.970]  Oh, wait.
[23:17.790 --> 23:18.810]  You know what it was?
[23:19.030 --> 23:19.830]  First attempt.
[23:20.070 --> 23:20.270]  Yeah.
[23:21.690 --> 23:26.370]  I'm sure Einstein didn't invent all of his theory of relativities in one day.
[23:26.890 --> 23:27.630]  All of them.
[23:27.850 --> 23:28.370]  All of them.
[23:28.530 --> 23:29.830]  Hey, omelets and eggs and all that.
[23:29.830 --> 23:33.870]  So do we want to put the Gumplers that work, the ShotGumplers, in the freezer?
[23:34.190 --> 23:34.870]  Because they're in the fridge.
[23:36.290 --> 23:37.010]  Oh no.
[23:37.010 --> 23:37.890]  We should drink something out of them.
[23:37.970 --> 23:38.590]  Okay, what do you want to drink?
[23:38.630 --> 23:39.470]  Oh no!
[23:40.530 --> 23:41.210]  Oh no!
[23:41.570 --> 23:42.370]  Well, we better hurry.
[23:42.850 --> 23:44.530]  White monsters for three white monsters.
[23:45.170 --> 23:45.930]  Alright, I'm gonna...
[23:46.730 --> 23:48.030]  I'll use this cricket.
[23:48.190 --> 23:49.290]  Okay, I'll take this tall one.
[23:52.010 --> 23:53.150]  Nick, you might have to re-pour.
[23:55.330 --> 23:57.390]  Oh, it doesn't... it might not come off.
[23:57.670 --> 23:59.270]  Hey, get a spatula or something.
[24:00.190 --> 24:03.250]  Looks like nursery school pottery.
[24:04.630 --> 24:06.310]  Cheers, guys. Gavin, do you want to get yours?
[24:10.690 --> 24:12.290]  Alright, pour me a little.
[24:13.090 --> 24:14.730]  It's like completely ungrippable.
[24:15.290 --> 24:16.190]  Come on, Gavin, hurry up.
[24:17.230 --> 24:18.130]  You almost got it.
[24:18.270 --> 24:19.230]  This will be my first monster.
[24:19.890 --> 24:20.250]  Hell yeah.
[24:20.450 --> 24:21.650]  Sweet, you're gonna be running all night.
[24:21.650 --> 24:23.730]  Dude, white monster too? We're gonna go hang some drywall.
[24:23.850 --> 24:24.310]  Yeah, we are.
[24:25.290 --> 24:25.570]  Alright.
[24:27.650 --> 24:29.570]  Cheers, boys. To Gumplers.
[24:29.570 --> 24:30.510]  Cheers, fellas.
[24:34.570 --> 24:35.650]  It's better than you think.
[24:37.090 --> 24:37.990]  That's pretty good.
[24:38.170 --> 24:38.830]  I don't hate it.
[24:38.950 --> 24:39.790]  That's pretty fucking good.
[24:45.250 --> 24:46.870]  Take a bite, take a bite.
[24:47.470 --> 24:48.190]  Take a bite.
[24:48.290 --> 24:49.190]  Take a bite, finish it off.
[24:56.580 --> 24:58.940]  The green is so bad.
[24:59.380 --> 25:01.080]  Geoff is cool because he's got purple.
[25:01.520 --> 25:02.440]  Look at Gavin.
[25:04.880 --> 25:05.440]  Oh!
[25:07.520 --> 25:10.080]  I bit into it and it's stuck into my nose hole.
[25:18.970 --> 25:21.530]  He just does not have a palate for America.
[25:22.210 --> 25:22.750]  I don't.
[25:23.090 --> 25:24.270]  He can't do it.
[25:26.110 --> 25:27.570]  It stained my fingers.
[25:27.570 --> 25:28.350]  It's everywhere.
[25:28.810 --> 25:30.750]  He can't handle our advanced flavors.
[25:31.570 --> 25:32.490]  Is this soap?
[25:32.790 --> 25:33.730]  He has power wash.
[25:33.830 --> 25:35.610]  Stay tuned for another part, I guess.
[25:36.450 --> 25:37.210]  Thanks for watching.
[25:39.050 --> 25:40.190]  There's more to learn later.
[25:40.970 --> 25:41.910]  Bye.
