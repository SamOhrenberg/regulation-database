[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  Hot spoon. Think about it. An electric spoon that also heats your food up while it's heating
[00:05.680 --> 00:09.840]  up on the stove even faster. I thought it might exist. So I have another idea for you.
[00:10.040 --> 00:16.740]  Cold spoon. A spoon that cools things down electrically. Say your soup's too hot and
[00:16.740 --> 00:20.380]  you're like, oh, it's too hot and you gotta blow on it. Cold spoon. Decently cool spoon
[00:20.380 --> 00:23.720]  that you put it in that just cools things down so you don't have to blow on them.
[00:23.800 --> 00:27.720]  I mean, could that be done with just like a hollow spoon full of a cooling liquid that
[00:27.720 --> 00:28.580]  you just keep in the freezer?
[00:28.580 --> 00:33.000]  Yeah, in my mind, it's done somehow with watch batteries and electronics. But yeah,
[00:33.040 --> 00:34.140]  it could probably be done that way too.
[00:34.360 --> 00:34.500]  Interesting.
[00:34.560 --> 00:37.400]  I'm going to take a step back and say, I don't know if it's the hot spoon. I think
[00:37.400 --> 00:43.380]  what I was thinking of is they made a spoon that makes things taste salty. It adds a sodium
[00:43.380 --> 00:45.220]  taste to a salt spoon.
[00:45.600 --> 00:48.160]  Is hot and salt the same to you?
[00:48.480 --> 00:51.960]  No, but I think I just went innovative spoon. But I'm trying to...
[00:51.960 --> 00:53.960]  I'm trying to...
[00:53.960 --> 00:55.200]  Was it just me?
[00:55.360 --> 00:59.240]  No, my brain went technology spoon and I immediately went salt.
