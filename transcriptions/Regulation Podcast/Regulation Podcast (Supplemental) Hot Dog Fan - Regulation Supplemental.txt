[00:02.100 --> 00:02.420]  Oh.
[00:05.780 --> 00:06.100]  Okay.
[00:09.060 --> 00:09.380]  Ooh.
[00:09.780 --> 00:10.420]  Dog lengths.
[00:12.660 --> 00:13.120]  All right.
[00:13.240 --> 00:15.280]  Boy, you better get in and get out quick.
[00:16.360 --> 00:17.620]  Are we doing four dogs?
[00:17.980 --> 00:18.200]  Yeah.
[00:18.760 --> 00:19.440]  Four of us, right?
[00:19.960 --> 00:20.520]  Yeah, one each.
[00:21.000 --> 00:21.960]  Did you figure out how you're going to film it?
[00:22.060 --> 00:22.740]  Yeah, I'm just going to put it on there.
[00:22.940 --> 00:23.580]  I have a tripod.
[00:23.780 --> 00:24.540]  Like a little baby tripod.
[00:24.680 --> 00:24.820]  Oh.
[00:25.200 --> 00:25.520]  Downstairs.
[00:25.600 --> 00:25.820]  Oh.
[00:26.560 --> 00:29.320]  At some point, I'm going to be too old to stand on chairs.
[00:29.700 --> 00:29.980]  Oh.
[00:29.980 --> 00:31.980]  I feel like I'm getting there.
[00:32.000 --> 00:32.580]  Getting there.
[00:32.960 --> 00:33.980]  It's over a wobbly chair.
[00:34.160 --> 00:35.380]  Maybe another ten years.
[00:36.840 --> 00:37.940]  So, should we do a...
[00:37.940 --> 00:38.280]  Woo!
[00:38.440 --> 00:39.060]  Cut that dog!
[00:40.700 --> 00:42.900]  Do you think it's just going to be slapping the wall?
[00:43.700 --> 00:43.840]  Yeah.
[00:44.360 --> 00:44.600]  Maybe.
[00:44.800 --> 00:45.120]  Okay.
[00:46.420 --> 00:47.140]  Cut that.
[00:48.080 --> 00:49.680]  I think Albert's going to be happy about it.
[00:49.720 --> 00:50.280]  Oh, God, yeah.
[00:58.100 --> 00:58.820]  We're at work.
[01:00.780 --> 01:03.920]  I love you say that as if we wouldn't have been doing this with a fucking giant bouncy
[01:04.340 --> 01:05.480]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:10.080 --> 01:12.700]  It's verging on like a Freddy got fingered contraption.
[01:12.920 --> 01:13.400]  It is.
[01:13.540 --> 01:14.100]  It's close.
[01:14.440 --> 01:15.380]  I don't remember that movie.
[01:15.480 --> 01:16.500]  Daddy, would you like some sausage?
[01:16.600 --> 01:17.760]  He plays piano a little bit.
[01:18.120 --> 01:18.260]  Lower.
[01:18.660 --> 01:18.900]  Lower.
[01:19.240 --> 01:19.340]  Lower.
[01:20.100 --> 01:20.340]  Lower.
[01:21.100 --> 01:21.500]  That's it.
[01:21.740 --> 01:21.860]  Okay.
[01:22.240 --> 01:22.360]  Oh.
[01:29.170 --> 01:29.570]  Yes.
[01:29.750 --> 01:30.750]  It looks like a bun wig.
[01:33.470 --> 01:34.990]  Well, we have our contraption.
[01:36.290 --> 01:38.730]  I don't think I'm going to tell my wife about what we shot today.
[01:39.250 --> 01:39.790]  Not any of it?
[01:40.230 --> 01:41.330]  The first bits, maybe.
[01:41.930 --> 01:44.130]  Okay, so.
[01:44.990 --> 01:45.350]  What?
[01:45.710 --> 01:48.010]  I think, Geoff, I think you need to be back here because your back's right to the camera.
[01:48.190 --> 01:48.310]  Okay.
[01:48.490 --> 01:49.090]  So it's like that.
[01:49.410 --> 01:50.530]  Nick, I guess you can be there.
[01:50.630 --> 01:50.890]  That's fine.
[01:51.150 --> 01:52.290]  And then...
[01:53.310 --> 01:55.010]  Okay, so are we recording?
[01:56.150 --> 01:56.410]  Yeah.
[01:56.590 --> 01:56.830]  Okay.
[01:56.990 --> 01:57.570]  Okay, that's cool.
[01:57.690 --> 02:02.910]  So this is Gavin's idea of eating hot dogs off a fan.
[02:03.110 --> 02:04.150]  Because we're a little hot dog fan.
[02:04.150 --> 02:04.690]  Yeah.
[02:05.250 --> 02:05.610]  Oh!
[02:05.910 --> 02:06.650]  Is that how you got there?
[02:06.930 --> 02:07.130]  No.
[02:07.390 --> 02:08.050]  Absolutely not.
[02:08.150 --> 02:09.210]  There's no fucking shot.
[02:09.270 --> 02:09.510]  Okay.
[02:09.690 --> 02:10.190]  That's a payoff.
[02:10.390 --> 02:11.130]  Here we go.
[02:11.290 --> 02:12.550]  We're going to turn the fan on, Geoff.
[02:12.610 --> 02:13.050]  How do we turn the fan on?
[02:13.050 --> 02:13.770]  Nick, hit that right.
[02:13.990 --> 02:14.270]  That one?
[02:14.430 --> 02:14.570]  Yeah.
[02:14.670 --> 02:18.450]  So Wynna has a swollen piece of dog in her gut.
[02:18.450 --> 02:18.810]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:19.410 --> 02:19.770]  Okay.
[02:20.230 --> 02:20.770]  No hands.
[02:21.610 --> 02:22.170]  No hands.
[02:22.390 --> 02:22.570]  Okay.
[02:22.850 --> 02:23.210]  You all ready?
[02:23.290 --> 02:23.470]  Yep.
[02:23.690 --> 02:23.870]  Set.
[02:24.870 --> 02:25.030]  Go.
[02:26.030 --> 02:26.790]  Oh my god.
[02:26.990 --> 02:27.710]  Oh my god.
[02:27.830 --> 02:28.530]  Is this on low?
[02:28.690 --> 02:28.890]  Ooh!
[02:29.470 --> 02:29.710]  Yeah.
[02:30.470 --> 02:32.970]  All right, here we go.
[02:36.030 --> 02:38.010]  You have like two dogs a head.
[02:38.230 --> 02:38.770]  It's so hot.
[02:39.390 --> 02:40.650]  I live with everyone's face.
[02:46.210 --> 02:47.330]  Oh, that was close, Gav.
[02:52.990 --> 02:54.170]  Oh, tangled dog.
[02:54.230 --> 02:55.010]  Oh, shit.
[02:56.090 --> 02:56.650]  Wait, no.
[02:57.490 --> 02:58.450]  It's going, it's going.
[02:59.710 --> 03:01.490]  We might have to go medium on this fan.
[03:02.510 --> 03:03.270]  Oh, oh, oh!
[03:03.330 --> 03:03.890]  Okay, not one.
[03:04.430 --> 03:05.230]  All right, turn it up one.
[03:05.390 --> 03:06.210]  Medium is the middle.
[03:06.510 --> 03:06.870]  There you go.
[03:07.110 --> 03:07.670]  Okay, here we go.
[03:07.970 --> 03:08.210]  Oh!
[03:08.750 --> 03:09.830]  Oh my god.
[03:09.970 --> 03:10.130]  Ow!
[03:12.190 --> 03:12.550]  Ow!
[03:13.770 --> 03:14.130]  Oh!
[03:14.130 --> 03:14.450]  Oh!
[03:17.270 --> 03:17.390]  Oh!
[03:17.870 --> 03:17.950]  Oh!
[03:18.070 --> 03:18.430]  Oh!
[03:18.970 --> 03:19.330]  Oh!
[03:23.850 --> 03:24.030]  Oh!
[03:25.970 --> 03:27.690]  I can't pick it up!
[03:27.910 --> 03:29.270]  I can't fucking climb it!
[03:30.050 --> 03:30.950]  All right, I'm gonna get this bitch.
[03:31.770 --> 03:32.470]  All right, there's one left.
[03:33.910 --> 03:35.050]  Where'd the other one go?
[03:35.090 --> 03:35.970]  I'm gonna jump for it.
[03:36.330 --> 03:37.570]  I'm gonna jump for it.
[03:40.170 --> 03:41.350]  Sorry, take it back down to me.
[03:41.390 --> 03:42.070]  This is slow.
[03:42.330 --> 03:43.230]  This is crazy.
[03:43.490 --> 03:45.310]  It fucking works on your phone.
[03:46.350 --> 03:47.930]  Where the fuck did it go?
[03:48.110 --> 03:49.710]  It's in pieces.
[03:53.430 --> 03:54.930]  Well, I feel like I can't get it.
[03:54.950 --> 03:56.690]  Well, I don't know if...
[03:56.690 --> 03:57.930]  You gotta switch spots?
[03:58.030 --> 03:58.210]  Yeah.
[03:58.890 --> 03:59.350]  Oh!
[03:59.570 --> 04:00.590]  I'm gonna get this bitch.
[04:02.890 --> 04:03.050]  Oh!
[04:03.050 --> 04:03.230]  Oh!
[04:05.350 --> 04:06.270]  He's got it!
[04:06.930 --> 04:07.190]  Oh!
[04:08.690 --> 04:09.230]  Oh!
[04:15.550 --> 04:16.390]  Oh, shit!
[04:25.650 --> 04:26.790]  I'm dialing it in.
[04:27.910 --> 04:28.290]  Ow!
[04:29.110 --> 04:30.830]  I should not be this winded from jumping.
[04:35.530 --> 04:36.250]  Oh, Geoff!
[04:36.530 --> 04:37.210]  Geoff, here it comes!
[04:37.370 --> 04:37.670]  Here it comes!
[04:37.830 --> 04:38.030]  Oh!
[04:42.450 --> 04:43.050]  Here it comes!
[04:50.560 --> 04:52.020]  It's all tape and string.
[04:52.020 --> 04:53.100]  It's all tape and string, man!
[04:53.520 --> 04:54.880]  Well, um...
[04:56.080 --> 04:57.060]  What did we learn today?
[04:57.240 --> 04:57.760]  Ow, my nose!
[04:59.660 --> 05:01.660]  We had to see who the big hot dog fan was.
[05:01.760 --> 05:02.660]  I think it's Geoff.
[05:02.800 --> 05:04.380]  I think Geoff is the big hot dog fan.
[05:06.160 --> 05:06.860]  Well, I...
[05:08.480 --> 05:10.720]  Nick, turn that fan off.
[05:10.760 --> 05:11.020]  Okay.
[05:12.320 --> 05:13.840]  This is so much harder than it looks.
[05:14.040 --> 05:14.620]  Yeah, that's...
[05:27.180 --> 05:27.580]  Oops.
[05:30.220 --> 05:31.180]  I'll have to fix that.
[05:31.300 --> 05:31.800]  Alright, Geoff.
[05:32.000 --> 05:32.660]  Here it comes.
[05:42.740 --> 05:42.840]  Ew.
[05:46.760 --> 05:47.120]  Yeah!
[05:49.640 --> 05:50.760]  Oh, my God.
[05:53.340 --> 05:54.580]  Well, thanks for watching.
[05:54.880 --> 05:56.440]  Is that exactly what you thought it would be?
[05:56.840 --> 05:58.580]  When we get the August, we'll have to do this again.
[05:58.960 --> 06:00.100]  It'll be like a yearly competition.
[06:00.260 --> 06:00.340]  Yeah.
[06:00.880 --> 06:01.680]  Oh, my God.
[06:02.080 --> 06:02.820]  Oh, shit.
[06:03.980 --> 06:04.900]  Nick's got the dogs.
[06:05.020 --> 06:06.080]  The dog wants the dogs.
[06:06.260 --> 06:06.460]  Oh, my God.
[06:07.080 --> 06:08.220]  He lost the door.
[06:09.620 --> 06:09.940]  Nice!
[06:10.760 --> 06:11.160]  Nice!
[06:11.520 --> 06:12.400]  Way to go, guys.
[06:12.600 --> 06:14.240]  Well, that'll do it for this video.
[06:15.620 --> 06:17.080]  Subscribe on Patreon, I guess.
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.160]  Oh, bye, Geoff, a new door.
[06:19.360 --> 06:19.980]  Oh, my door.
[06:20.500 --> 06:20.700]  Damn.
[06:21.220 --> 06:21.460]  Alright.
[06:22.420 --> 06:22.820]  Bye.
[06:23.480 --> 06:24.340]  Look at his nap.
