[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Do you think dildos got bigger with time?
[00:02.960 --> 00:03.940]  Dildos got bigger with time?
[00:04.080 --> 00:05.660]  Like what, like people got taller over time?
[00:05.860 --> 00:09.780]  No, like, do you think that like the expectation changed over time?
[00:10.200 --> 00:13.720]  Oh, like the first dildo was the first dildos were like, kind of like modest.
[00:13.880 --> 00:15.460]  Yeah. And then as time progressed, like.
[00:15.660 --> 00:18.240]  I mean, you can go back and look at dildos
[00:18.240 --> 00:21.840]  they've dug up that are like 5000 years old and see for yourself.
[00:22.180 --> 00:25.580]  There's some there's some there's some honkers out there from the olden days.
[00:26.020 --> 00:29.740]  I think a dildo dildo culture is always slightly getting bigger.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.260]  I don't know how they know it's a dildo, though.
[00:32.940 --> 00:35.860]  Like, surely, wouldn't stuff become dildo over time?
[00:37.600 --> 00:40.460]  Like, wouldn't a bunch of stuff
[00:40.460 --> 00:43.260]  eventually erode down to just like a cylinder of stone or something?
[00:43.880 --> 00:45.260]  And they're like, oh, it's a dildo.
[00:45.760 --> 00:48.480]  What if it was a rolling pin?
[00:48.620 --> 00:50.480]  Or like, what if it was some sort of tool?
[00:50.600 --> 00:53.180]  Do you think people are incorrectly declaring dildos that aren't dildos?
[00:53.260 --> 00:56.300]  Yeah, I think a lot of stuff looks like a dildo at the end.
