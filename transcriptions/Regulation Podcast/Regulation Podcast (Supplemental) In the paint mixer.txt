[00:00.000 --> 00:05.080]  I would consider, uh-huh, near the paint mixer to cover the noise.
[00:05.580 --> 00:07.480]  That's because it's pretty good.
[00:08.340 --> 00:09.560]  Nobody can hear you pee.
[00:09.840 --> 00:11.320]  That's a manned paint mixer.
[00:11.600 --> 00:14.500]  Yeah, the problem with the paint mixer is that an employee works it
[00:14.500 --> 00:18.040]  and it's in the middle front of every Home Depot I've ever been to.
