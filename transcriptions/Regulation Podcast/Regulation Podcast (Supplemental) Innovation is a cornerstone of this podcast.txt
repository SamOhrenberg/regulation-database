[00:00.000 --> 00:05.920]  What if you, Geoff, farted in a balloon and then you cork it off and when you next have to fart
[00:05.920 --> 00:09.940]  again you fart in the balloon and you see how long it takes to pop it? Man, I don't know.
[00:10.360 --> 00:14.880]  That's a precision that is... I really like where you're going with this but I feel like
[00:14.880 --> 00:18.000]  you're gonna let as much fart out as you put in every time you open that sucker up. You would
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.440]  need to make a device. Yeah, we'll make like a one-way valve. Okay. Yeah, if you can one-way
[00:23.440 --> 00:27.820]  it, yeah, I think that's great. What it'll look like for you is, I guess, sort of like a stick-on
[00:27.820 --> 00:31.800]  funnel for your butt. Yeah, so I think it would be a funnel that he would, like, essentially
[00:31.800 --> 00:37.020]  put his butt around and fart into and it would lead into a balloon.
