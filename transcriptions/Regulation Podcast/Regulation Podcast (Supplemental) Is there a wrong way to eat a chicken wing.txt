[00:00.000 --> 00:04.900]  Is there anything in real life that everyone uses just fine, but you don't trust?
[00:06.440 --> 00:07.300]  Chicken wings.
[00:09.140 --> 00:10.240]  Geoff, I want to take a nap.
[00:12.020 --> 00:14.500]  I don't feel like I know how to eat chicken wings.
[00:14.680 --> 00:16.320]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[00:16.320 --> 00:20.260]  Well, because whenever you see people eat chicken wings, they've got like the twi...
[00:20.260 --> 00:24.880]  I see people do like, oh, you twist the bone and the bone comes right out or you bite this.
[00:25.040 --> 00:28.600]  Like there are all these different techniques to eating chicken wings.
[00:28.600 --> 00:32.140]  There's a bunch of different techniques to eating a banana too,
[00:32.240 --> 00:34.040]  but most people just do it the normal way.
[00:34.520 --> 00:35.860]  But there aren't bones in a banana.
[00:36.420 --> 00:39.020]  Put it navigating around fucking eat.
[00:39.700 --> 00:42.560]  I can absolutely eat a chicken wing, but I feel like I'm missing out.
[00:43.480 --> 00:45.820]  Yeah, but I don't feel like I'm doing it right when I do it.
[00:46.340 --> 00:47.440]  There's no wrong way to eat.
[00:48.380 --> 00:50.540]  I don't think I just said that now.
[00:50.640 --> 00:53.840]  I don't know that that's true because of you, but I can't.
[00:53.920 --> 00:56.860]  I think, however, you choking is the wrong way to eat.
[00:57.680 --> 00:58.760]  Yeah, that would be a wrong way.
