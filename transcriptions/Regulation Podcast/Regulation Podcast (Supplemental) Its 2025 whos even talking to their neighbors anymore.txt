[00:00.000 --> 00:05.960]  I drove through my old neighborhood where I sold the house. And I felt kind of sad. I hadn't
[00:05.960 --> 00:10.500]  experienced this before, but I felt kind of sad because there was like nobody to wave at or no
[00:10.500 --> 00:16.280]  like neighbor friends. And I realized that when we moved, I didn't say goodbye to a single neighbor
[00:16.280 --> 00:20.160]  and a single neighbor didn't say goodbye to me. And I was telling Emily about it. And I was like,
[00:20.200 --> 00:25.460]  I just felt kind of like we lived there for six years and didn't really leave a mark or matter
[00:25.460 --> 00:29.980]  or know anybody or make any kind of an imprint. So when you leave, it feels like you were never
[00:29.980 --> 00:33.360]  there, you know, and it's just kind of bums me out. And she was like, well, maybe you should
[00:33.360 --> 00:37.220]  make an effort with our current neighbors then. And I was like, what the fuck are you thinking?
[00:37.420 --> 00:41.700]  Oh my God. And then I realized how much I don't care about that other thing,
[00:41.700 --> 00:47.160]  because it would mean I'd have to talk to people. I said goodbye to my old neighbor who lived next
[00:47.160 --> 00:52.600]  door to a house where some crazy shit happened. And I said, uh, sorry for being the worst
[00:52.600 --> 00:56.620]  neighbors in the world. And he said, it was real interesting.
