[00:00.000 --> 00:03.120]  Hello and welcome to another supplemental.
[00:03.920 --> 00:05.740]  As Eric described, this is a kicker picker.
[00:06.160 --> 00:08.100]  We got a kicker picker on our hands.
[00:08.560 --> 00:10.840]  The summer movie league is coming to an end.
[00:11.400 --> 00:14.140]  And this is going to be the next thing that lasts several months.
[00:14.200 --> 00:16.060]  Competition for us to keep updated on.
[00:16.540 --> 00:19.680]  But before we begin, I have a key question for Gavin.
[00:19.780 --> 00:21.880]  That he hasn't responded to in days.
[00:22.060 --> 00:23.500]  I asked him for a clarification.
[00:24.220 --> 00:26.500]  He never got back to me after my clarification.
[00:27.100 --> 00:27.580]  What was this?
[00:27.580 --> 00:30.500]  How do you feel about a kick being worth three points
[00:30.500 --> 00:32.720]  as opposed to it being worth one?
[00:33.300 --> 00:33.840]  Oh, in football?
[00:34.420 --> 00:35.380]  Uh, yeah, in football.
[00:36.400 --> 00:36.800]  Soccer.
[00:37.340 --> 00:38.960]  I was saying soccer, hypothetically.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.320]  I had a follow up question, didn't I?
[00:40.860 --> 00:41.480]  Uh, I did. Yeah.
[00:41.500 --> 00:42.520]  And then I replied to it.
[00:42.780 --> 00:43.220]  Oh, shit.
[00:45.460 --> 00:45.860]  Fascinating.
[00:46.140 --> 00:48.240]  My question was, what would be worth one point?
[00:48.720 --> 00:50.020]  So I came up with the whole system.
[00:50.140 --> 00:50.680]  I was trying to...
[00:50.680 --> 00:54.580]  Because Gavin, his problem with football in the past has been
[00:54.580 --> 00:57.100]  that one point is worth six. Too high.
[00:57.820 --> 01:00.860]  So I was trying to find a lower ground.
[01:01.900 --> 01:02.960]  Which is kickers.
[01:03.120 --> 01:05.960]  Also, Gavin loves soccer, a.k.a. football.
[01:06.300 --> 01:10.020]  So I thought the best way to get us all on board, because the rest of us
[01:10.020 --> 01:14.620]  have varying degrees of interest in football already, is to focus on football.
[01:14.720 --> 01:19.040]  But just the kicking part, just the part where they kick the ball into a goal.
[01:19.440 --> 01:20.920]  Because Gavin likes that already.
[01:21.400 --> 01:25.140]  But before we can pick, we need to decide, are we only focusing on one kick,
[01:25.140 --> 01:28.800]  one point, or is Gavin OK with one kick being worth three points?
[01:30.420 --> 01:34.580]  If you kicked it within the keeper box, it's one, but further out, it's three.
[01:35.180 --> 01:38.520]  That analogy really isn't specific to this.
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.800]  That was me trying to equate soccer to football.
[01:40.820 --> 01:43.100]  It's not a distance thing. It's a situational thing.
[01:43.240 --> 01:47.820]  And sometimes a kick in American football or gridiron, as you people call it,
[01:48.160 --> 01:51.220]  is worth three points when it's a field goal and one point
[01:51.220 --> 01:54.220]  when it's an extra point scored after a touchdown.
[01:54.800 --> 01:57.120]  I would think that we'd want to maintain that integrity.
[01:58.020 --> 02:00.340]  I just wanted to see where Gavin was at with it
[02:00.340 --> 02:03.080]  before we advanced, if he was OK with that.
[02:03.880 --> 02:07.060]  Sure. I mean, I just grew up with, you know, everything's one point.
[02:08.760 --> 02:10.800]  But that's not even... OK, fair enough.
[02:10.920 --> 02:11.360]  You're right.
[02:11.700 --> 02:14.560]  But there are soccer games where the ball is worth more than one.
[02:14.900 --> 02:15.400]  That's fine.
[02:15.800 --> 02:16.620]  Like a golden goal.
[02:16.980 --> 02:18.900]  Yeah, like a golden goal scenario. Exactly.
[02:19.440 --> 02:23.500]  Anyway, we have a board of all the NFL kickers
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.800]  we're looking at in front of us.
[02:24.940 --> 02:27.020]  I have listed their teams.
[02:27.460 --> 02:31.040]  I've listed how many times they've kicked the ball in the NFL
[02:31.500 --> 02:34.420]  and a photo of who they are alongside it.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.820]  The photo really helps.
[02:36.060 --> 02:39.500]  I think that I think the photo is such an improvement here.
[02:39.560 --> 02:41.700]  I think that's I think you got to really lock in on the photos
[02:41.700 --> 02:45.240]  because these are their official NFL profile photos,
[02:45.400 --> 02:47.860]  which is sort of insane for some of them.
[02:48.480 --> 02:49.540]  We have a whole list.
[02:49.700 --> 02:51.240]  White guy, white guy, white guy, white guy, white guy.
[02:51.240 --> 02:53.560]  It's all white guy, white guy, white guy, white guy, white guy.
[02:53.640 --> 02:55.080]  It doesn't it doesn't stop.
[02:55.340 --> 02:56.460]  It's a bunch of white guys.
[02:57.060 --> 02:59.860]  Oh, no, there's there's one at least that isn't white.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.060]  Oh, the Falcons kicker. That's pretty young. Oh, cool.
[03:02.520 --> 03:04.020]  Yeah. Awesome kicker.
[03:04.280 --> 03:05.960]  So we are going to go through. We're going to pick
[03:07.600 --> 03:10.100]  every field goal gets us three points.
[03:10.540 --> 03:12.400]  The end of the season, whoever has the most points wins.
[03:12.980 --> 03:13.720]  Pretty simple.
[03:14.260 --> 03:16.140]  We're picking six kickers.
[03:17.400 --> 03:20.440]  Sixers and yeah, a six pack kickback.
[03:20.440 --> 03:23.640]  Six pack. Eric, you're on fire today.
[03:24.120 --> 03:25.740]  Six pack kickback. This is my wheelhouse.
[03:26.140 --> 03:28.120]  This is this is the only thing I'm good at.
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.580]  It's this and then putting something on a calendar.
[03:31.960 --> 03:34.460]  Yeah, but you fucking you kill it on the calendar.
[03:34.800 --> 03:35.360]  Yeah. Thanks, buddy.
[03:35.760 --> 03:36.700]  Yeah, the calendar is great.
[03:37.120 --> 03:39.400]  Mm hmm. How do we want to pick who goes first?
[03:39.740 --> 03:45.120]  Or well, we have the that fan made that the official like
[03:45.120 --> 03:48.080]  the unofficial official draft. Uh huh.
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.420]  Uh, I think we can just use that to randomize and see how it goes.
[03:52.520 --> 03:54.380]  How do you feel about that? Do you have no problem?
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.300]  You remember that website?
[03:56.480 --> 03:59.000]  Not in the slightest. I'm not mad at all.
[03:59.440 --> 04:00.740]  Yeah, I don't see it.
[04:01.400 --> 04:02.680]  Random.org it is.
[04:03.140 --> 04:05.020]  All right. Let's just do. How about this?
[04:05.040 --> 04:06.100]  We've never done this before.
[04:06.320 --> 04:09.040]  Let's do one to randomize. OK.
[04:09.600 --> 04:11.180]  Whoa. Just one.
[04:11.180 --> 04:12.780]  This one's always just start.
[04:13.040 --> 04:15.460]  Just start an egg and then we just hit it once.
[04:15.740 --> 04:17.180]  Ooh. Are you on your VPN?
[04:17.840 --> 04:19.780]  No. Oh, OK.
[04:19.920 --> 04:21.460]  That's all right. We're only doing it once. It's OK.
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.960]  Just take a screenshot of the thing when it happens.
[04:25.320 --> 04:26.140]  OK, here we go.
[04:26.860 --> 04:28.360]  I mean, you said you're recording your own thing.
[04:29.200 --> 04:31.660]  Not anymore. You seem to be doing so it looks better.
[04:32.160 --> 04:38.620]  I just like the pivot without talking to anyone is like the craziest thing
[04:38.620 --> 04:40.760]  you can do for this fucking show.
[04:41.060 --> 04:46.640]  Like why? Without saying anything to totally pivot off of what you were doing
[04:46.640 --> 04:50.960]  and just expect that, oh yeah, nothing should change here.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.700]  Like you're nuts. You know what? You're nuts.
[04:53.920 --> 04:55.320]  That's fair, Nick. That's fair.
[04:55.440 --> 04:58.520]  But also I wanted what we saw to be what the audience sees.
[04:58.700 --> 05:01.540]  And if I was just sitting on this page, they wouldn't see the same thing anyway.
[05:02.360 --> 05:05.700]  Randomize. I appreciate the egg order.
[05:05.840 --> 05:07.700]  One randomization. Here it comes.
[05:09.700 --> 05:14.200]  Yeah, Eric, Geoff, Andrew, Gavin, Nick, Eric, Geoff,
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.340]  Andrew, Gavin, Nick Egg,
[05:18.460 --> 05:21.940]  careful. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, OK.
[05:22.200 --> 05:23.960]  Can we all edit this? Yeah.
[05:25.120 --> 05:30.740]  Yep. Nick, Eric, Geoff, Andrew.
[05:31.300 --> 05:34.720]  Uh-huh. Somebody else is changing it, so I'm not clicking on anything.
[05:36.140 --> 05:38.580]  I'm going to guess that's Gavin doing that.
[05:39.000 --> 05:39.700]  Oh, that's me. Yeah.
[05:40.100 --> 05:43.880]  Yeah. Again, the communication that this team has
[05:43.880 --> 05:45.940]  is insane to me.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.860]  Just call out. I'll do it.
[05:49.580 --> 05:51.940]  Oh, who put me twice?
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.160]  What's going on?
[05:55.680 --> 05:58.820]  Yeah, I, I, dude, I don't.
[05:59.400 --> 06:01.380]  Maybe we designate a toucher.
[06:01.560 --> 06:02.380]  Yeah, you're the design.
[06:02.420 --> 06:05.240]  That person for the rest of this episode is the designated toucher.
[06:05.660 --> 06:09.240]  They do all the touching and diddling and fondling of the CSV file.
[06:09.580 --> 06:13.080]  Everybody move your cursor outside of the video section.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.640]  Andrew, would you like to?
[06:15.440 --> 06:17.180]  Andrew, do you want to diddle the file?
[06:18.240 --> 06:19.760]  I don't. Am I qualified?
[06:19.880 --> 06:21.040]  Yeah, I can diddle the file.
[06:21.900 --> 06:23.200]  Nick, where do you want my cursor?
[06:24.240 --> 06:26.580]  Well, you're going to be moving it around so you can get whatever.
[06:27.140 --> 06:29.060]  OK, I'm not in cursor jail.
[06:29.240 --> 06:31.980]  Hey, who who is that piss?
[06:32.320 --> 06:34.300]  Oh, I see what you're doing, piss boy.
[06:34.560 --> 06:35.440]  I'm not piss boy.
[06:37.080 --> 06:38.160]  That's the old show.
[06:40.340 --> 06:41.300]  It's just nuts.
[06:41.760 --> 06:42.640]  Are we going to start?
[06:42.760 --> 06:43.800]  Yeah, are we going to? Let's do it.
[06:44.220 --> 06:45.840]  OK, Nick, you're on the board.
[06:45.920 --> 06:46.960]  Take your first kicker.
[06:47.480 --> 06:48.960]  Well, I do follow football.
[06:49.220 --> 06:53.640]  This guy was a kicker at both the college I went to.
[06:53.960 --> 06:58.460]  And now for the Ravens, it's Justin Tucker, number 26 on this list.
[06:58.880 --> 07:01.020]  Yeah, I mean, that's that that's the one.
[07:01.160 --> 07:01.820]  He's the moneymaker.
[07:02.460 --> 07:04.360]  Yeah, that's he's he's it.
[07:06.640 --> 07:08.120]  That's on the older end.
[07:08.280 --> 07:09.680]  One of the most kicks in the league.
[07:09.680 --> 07:11.120]  438 kicks.
[07:11.740 --> 07:12.740]  Kicking for a while.
[07:13.400 --> 07:14.640]  All right. What are you going to pick, Eric?
[07:16.580 --> 07:18.220]  Well, it's it's tough.
[07:18.600 --> 07:21.820]  There's a lot that we have here that we can choose from.
[07:21.900 --> 07:26.500]  I could have Will Reichardt, who has never kicked a kick in the NFL.
[07:27.080 --> 07:30.880]  You could have Nick Folk, who appears to be the oldest man playing in the NFL.
[07:31.020 --> 07:34.560]  Nick Folk looks like he's ready to grill for all of the kids.
[07:34.760 --> 07:38.200]  He's like, yeah, he looked that way ten years ago, too.
[07:38.200 --> 07:41.600]  Yeah, he does crawfish boils.
[07:41.880 --> 07:45.040]  Yeah, there there's a lot there's a lot to choose from.
[07:45.620 --> 07:49.420]  But I'm going to take a young gun and I'm going to go
[07:49.420 --> 07:53.380]  Dallas Cowboys, Brandon Aubrey. Oh, yeah.
[07:53.640 --> 07:55.440]  I was getting ready to autofill that for Nick.
[07:55.980 --> 07:56.580]  You know, he's a cowboy.
[07:56.940 --> 07:58.720]  That's you got to take it out from under Nick.
[07:58.820 --> 08:01.460]  I feel good about it. I don't.
[08:02.160 --> 08:06.100]  I think that the Cowboys are mostly going to be settling for field goals
[08:07.760 --> 08:09.540]  all year long.
[08:09.720 --> 08:10.920]  I feel really good about my pick.
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.100]  All right. I'm sitting right here, man.
[08:14.120 --> 08:16.220]  OK, well, I'm going to go with my pick.
[08:16.760 --> 08:17.940]  I'm not going to move the board.
[08:18.020 --> 08:19.340]  I'm going to let Andrew do it.
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.960]  I'm going to be respectful of the rules.
[08:21.600 --> 08:23.600]  Andrew, would you go ahead and select for me?
[08:23.700 --> 08:26.600]  Go down to the down to the R's, please. OK.
[08:28.460 --> 08:31.140]  Are you sure it's it's Raiders?
[08:31.280 --> 08:31.820]  There we go.
[08:31.900 --> 08:34.840]  I want Daniel Carlson, please. Daniel Carlson.
[08:34.840 --> 08:35.640]  Oh, interesting.
[08:35.920 --> 08:39.680]  The the the only kicker in the NFL
[08:39.680 --> 08:43.360]  to hit at least 90 percent of his field goals in each of his past three seasons.
[08:43.720 --> 08:45.900]  Is that right? Supposedly.
[08:45.940 --> 08:46.540]  Wow. Wow.
[08:49.900 --> 08:53.960]  Andrew, we've had the Ravens, the Cowboys, the Raiders are off the board.
[08:54.260 --> 08:56.160]  This is tough. See, I'm looking down, Eric.
[08:56.220 --> 08:57.880]  You want to scroll down to the Vikings?
[08:58.060 --> 08:59.860]  Will Riker. Oh, the Vikings.
[09:00.200 --> 09:03.760]  I don't know if I'm going to take him, but he looks like the asshole in a horror
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.820]  movie. It looks like a kind of obnoxious jock that dies early.
[09:08.920 --> 09:10.840]  I don't know if I want that on my squad.
[09:11.740 --> 09:14.840]  Blake Group looks like he is being forced to smile.
[09:14.980 --> 09:18.020]  And also, yeah, that's that's the picture when I was scrolling earlier
[09:18.020 --> 09:19.100]  and I started laughing.
[09:19.100 --> 09:21.260]  It's because I saw Blake Group for the Saints.
[09:21.400 --> 09:26.920]  That's a rough trade, but it looks like he is fresh out of high school.
[09:27.260 --> 09:30.700]  I like the energy. I like the he's got some good vibes.
[09:30.700 --> 09:35.180]  He looks like he is going to be the CW star of the next football show.
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.960]  So I'm going to go with the Lions and Jake Bates.
[09:38.440 --> 09:41.400]  Also, I think a line could kick a ball pretty far if it needed to.
[09:41.540 --> 09:44.120]  OK, so we're just going off vibes that there's no actual thought.
[09:44.220 --> 09:47.980]  Well, yeah, I'm going for he has doesn't have any kicks, surely off vibes.
[09:48.300 --> 09:49.200]  OK, I like it.
[09:50.180 --> 09:52.500]  Dumb shit is next on the board, apparently.
[09:53.640 --> 09:54.500]  I have a
[09:57.040 --> 09:58.060]  hey, guys, dumb shit.
[09:58.060 --> 09:59.020]  I have a question.
[10:00.740 --> 10:02.100]  I have a small question.
[10:02.560 --> 10:04.480]  So yeah, what is that?
[10:04.580 --> 10:06.300]  What are we doing? What is this?
[10:06.500 --> 10:07.480]  What are we doing?
[10:07.860 --> 10:09.020]  What are you talking about?
[10:09.960 --> 10:11.940]  So what is everyone talking about?
[10:12.120 --> 10:13.700]  It's a kicker picker.
[10:13.900 --> 10:15.420]  What do you mean it's a kicker picker?
[10:15.440 --> 10:15.940]  What are we doing?
[10:16.500 --> 10:18.720]  I got you to confirm the scoring.
[10:19.860 --> 10:26.620]  Yeah. And then I said, whoever gets the most points via kicks going through wins.
[10:27.270 --> 10:28.660]  So here's what's going to happen, Gavin.
[10:28.740 --> 10:29.860]  These are all the kicker.
[10:29.940 --> 10:32.960]  This is the this is the kicker for every team in the NFL.
[10:33.120 --> 10:33.940]  I explain that.
[10:33.940 --> 10:37.040]  We're all picking our our six kickers.
[10:37.180 --> 10:43.100]  I'm going to watch the entire season and every point they make will count to us.
[10:43.160 --> 10:45.700]  And at the end, whoever has the most points wins.
[10:46.140 --> 10:46.880]  I explain that.
[10:47.140 --> 10:48.300]  He did. He explained it all.
[10:48.320 --> 10:49.160]  I'm just reiterating.
[10:49.900 --> 10:50.700]  Does that make sense?
[10:51.760 --> 10:52.080]  Yeah.
[10:52.700 --> 10:55.100]  When do they when do they kick off to the touchdown?
[10:55.100 --> 10:57.440]  Yeah. Or if they kick a field goal?
[10:57.700 --> 10:59.760]  Yeah. It's either we'll count extra points.
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.700]  So whenever they score a touchdown, they kick.
[11:02.120 --> 11:05.400]  And if they're like, oh, we're close, but we can't.
[11:05.440 --> 11:06.880]  We're not going to make it. They kick.
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.700]  Do PATs count the same? No.
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.000]  That's what I want to do.
[11:11.660 --> 11:13.280]  What do we do with PATs?
[11:13.960 --> 11:17.800]  Yeah, that's what Gavin is always concerned about the PATs.
[11:18.120 --> 11:21.540]  Yeah. I assumed we were counting PATs, but we don't have to.
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.080]  We can just let's just do all the kicks, all the kicks that they're involved with.
[11:25.660 --> 11:27.540]  Uh, anytime they score.
[11:27.820 --> 11:31.060]  Yeah. Yep. Eddie Pinero.
[11:31.700 --> 11:33.460]  Why are you feeling Eddie Pinero, dumb shit?
[11:33.860 --> 11:36.200]  What what number? What team is he on?
[11:36.440 --> 11:37.340]  Who's Eddie Pinero?
[11:38.240 --> 11:41.540]  Panthers. I had Panero bread yesterday for lunch.
[11:45.280 --> 11:47.860]  OK. Eddie Pinero, you're on there.
[11:48.160 --> 11:50.000]  You got it. I love it.
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.060]  Gavin, it's your turn again.
[11:51.580 --> 11:54.240]  Yeah, Gavin, what did you eat for lunch the previous day?
[11:54.740 --> 11:58.520]  Uh, oh, I like I don't remember here or what.
[11:58.560 --> 12:00.240]  But there's a GoPro on my desk.
[12:00.380 --> 12:02.080]  That's a little camera. Cam Little.
[12:02.640 --> 12:05.360]  Wow. Oh, you took Cam Little out from under me.
[12:05.980 --> 12:08.520]  Damn. I love I love the Cam Little pic.
[12:08.700 --> 12:10.300]  Yeah, that's a good that's a pretty good pic.
[12:11.200 --> 12:14.900]  And then what what you're going to want to do is when you pick someone,
[12:15.080 --> 12:16.840]  you want to let us know what team they're on.
[12:16.880 --> 12:19.120]  So you say Jaguars, Cam Little.
[12:19.300 --> 12:22.120]  I mean, I wouldn't say Jaguars because that's not what that says.
[12:22.120 --> 12:25.240]  But what would you what would you say?
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.440]  Oh, Jaguar, you mean the Jaguar?
[12:29.800 --> 12:30.760]  Jaguar. Jaguar.
[12:30.960 --> 12:33.060]  OK. Yeah, well, that's exactly how it's spelled.
[12:34.260 --> 12:36.900]  Oh, is that is that the way this language works?
[12:40.680 --> 12:41.940]  Here's the word judgment.
[12:52.680 --> 12:53.700]  Geoff, you've been away.
[12:55.040 --> 12:57.600]  I've just had me in a real moody tootie.
[12:57.960 --> 13:00.740]  So my pick, I'm going to go with the 49ers.
[13:00.840 --> 13:02.160]  Jake Moody. Damn it.
[13:02.280 --> 13:03.600]  Fuck. That was going to be my pick.
[13:03.720 --> 13:05.480]  I think that's a I think that's a really strong pick.
[13:06.260 --> 13:09.060]  He looks like an approachable dude in a country bar.
[13:09.660 --> 13:11.480]  Yeah, I think that's I think that's pretty good.
[13:11.560 --> 13:13.940]  Are you you filling out that D column there, bud, or what?
[13:14.560 --> 13:17.060]  I sure can. I felt like you hopped in.
[13:17.140 --> 13:18.160]  So then I backed off.
[13:18.220 --> 13:19.440]  I'm I'm taking care.
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.820]  I'm taking care of what's going on in the main board.
[13:22.120 --> 13:26.220]  Got it. OK, uh, OK, it's my turn.
[13:26.600 --> 13:27.300]  Yeah, I'm Geoff.
[13:29.200 --> 13:30.900]  I'm pretty excited about this one.
[13:31.040 --> 13:33.960]  I think it's going to be a good year for the Indianapolis Colts.
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.380]  They have a great kicker.
[13:37.240 --> 13:39.620]  Great name, Matt Gay.
[13:40.640 --> 13:41.600]  Very interesting.
[13:42.200 --> 13:44.120]  Interesting. Very good team.
[13:44.220 --> 13:45.480]  Very on the on the rise.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.760]  That team. Yeah.
[13:46.800 --> 13:50.220]  In twenty twenty two, he hit ninety three point three percent of his field goals.
[13:50.740 --> 13:53.060]  Yeah, he did it the gay way, as they say.
[13:53.280 --> 13:57.180]  Well, if we're going by if we're going by great names,
[13:57.180 --> 13:58.960]  I think you've chosen a great one.
[13:59.240 --> 14:04.080]  I'm unfortunately having to go with my former team, the Los Angeles Chargers.
[14:04.980 --> 14:08.900]  And if you're talking kickers, you better be talking dickers.
[14:09.100 --> 14:11.600]  Cameron Dicker is my pick.
[14:11.680 --> 14:15.220]  The dicker kicker is my picker to win this whole thing.
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.480]  Nicknamed Dicker the kicker. No joke.
[14:18.360 --> 14:20.000]  That's I don't know that it's a nickname.
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.920]  So much as it is a name and a description of his job.
[14:23.240 --> 14:25.220]  It was his nickname at UT.
[14:26.200 --> 14:27.480]  Oh, is that where he kicked?
[14:27.740 --> 14:29.580]  Yeah. So thanks for taking.
[14:30.020 --> 14:30.900]  Yeah, I know. I saw.
[14:31.100 --> 14:33.340]  Yeah, I think I think Nick's a little annoyed.
[14:34.240 --> 14:36.780]  I took a cowboy and I took the UT guy.
[14:36.860 --> 14:37.720]  That's pretty cool.
[14:37.820 --> 14:39.640]  Yeah, you're Nixon and Jake Booty.
[14:43.660 --> 14:45.520]  A dumb shit that was pretty good.
[14:45.520 --> 14:46.780]  That's funny.
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.180]  That's pissing me off.
[14:48.680 --> 14:50.860]  That made me that made me laugh.
[14:50.940 --> 14:53.340]  So I'm going with Chase McLaughlin.
[14:53.540 --> 14:55.300]  That's McLaughlin for the bucks.
[14:55.860 --> 14:56.560]  Good joke.
[14:56.720 --> 14:58.420]  Doesn't even it's not even a spelt laugh.
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.340]  No, it's no, no, no.
[15:00.560 --> 15:02.700]  He took that name and tried to make it clay.
[15:02.960 --> 15:04.760]  According to Gavin, that would be Lauchlin.
[15:07.840 --> 15:08.320]  Lauchlin.
[15:09.080 --> 15:09.600]  Lauchlin.
[15:14.040 --> 15:17.200]  Oh, man, you were back on the board, Nick.
[15:17.560 --> 15:18.600]  Nick, you got it again.
[15:19.920 --> 15:25.320]  Oh, you know, I'm going to go with Graham Gnau.
[15:25.820 --> 15:26.720]  From the Giants.
[15:27.420 --> 15:29.040]  Damn it. I was going to pick that.
[15:30.320 --> 15:32.540]  Oh, because it's three G's.
[15:32.840 --> 15:33.600]  It is.
[15:33.780 --> 15:34.760]  Oh, he's triple G.
[15:35.100 --> 15:36.680]  Oh, guys, grocery games.
[15:37.700 --> 15:40.120]  That's what you think of when you hear Triple G?
[15:40.320 --> 15:41.080]  Yeah, that's what the nickname.
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.440]  We talked about how this was a pool of a lot of similar looking dudes and I'm going the other way.
[15:50.460 --> 15:56.060]  Young Hoku from the Falcons. He's my boy. He's my guy. I think the Falcons, again,
[15:56.160 --> 16:02.960]  I'm trying to pick teams that are not making it to the end zone. So from about 26 yards out,
[16:02.980 --> 16:05.840]  they're going to have to settle for three. I'm feeling good about my picks so far.
[16:07.940 --> 16:13.780]  Alright, it's my turn. I'm gonna give some real football analysis here. I think the
[16:13.780 --> 16:20.620]  Pittsburgh Steelers are going to have a fun season of watching Justin Fields and
[16:23.060 --> 16:29.200]  Russell Wilson fight over who can be the most mid quarterback in the NFL. And so I think they're
[16:29.200 --> 16:34.440]  going to have to rely pretty heavily on Chris Boswell for points. You see a lot of field goals
[16:34.440 --> 16:43.540]  for the Steelers kicker. Yeah, I think that's probably a pretty safe one. They are not making
[16:43.540 --> 16:47.800]  the end zone very much. It's going to be pretty exciting. Do you think they're going to do the
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.320]  Russell Wilson thing where it's like how many games does it take for him to throw as many
[16:51.320 --> 16:57.780]  touchdowns as he has bathrooms in his house again? I didn't see that last time. Oh really? Oh yeah,
[16:57.820 --> 17:02.120]  it was like how long does it take before he gets to nine touchdowns the number of bathrooms he has
[17:02.120 --> 17:09.300]  in his home? Took a long time. Do you think if you had nine bathrooms in your house, you'd make
[17:09.300 --> 17:15.560]  it a point to shit in every one quickly? Yeah. Do you think you could save one? Just be like, I want to leave
[17:15.560 --> 17:22.200]  one clean, pristine. Yeah, for like a special occasion. They don't stay good though. No,
[17:22.440 --> 17:28.260]  Gavin's right. Like I definitely think it's an issue. Yeah. What do you mean they don't stay good?
[17:28.260 --> 17:33.220]  Like the, if you, if you have a bog that's not used, the water evaporates out and it goes away.
[17:33.280 --> 17:38.700]  Yeah, the water will like, oh no, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's bad. Keep them flushed. That's
[17:38.700 --> 17:42.960]  how Russell Wilson stays fit. Yeah, that's how, that's his workout routine. He just runs up and
[17:42.960 --> 17:54.850]  down stairs. Drills flushing. Yeah, that's why he's fucking sucks. But now it's Andrew's pick.
[17:55.410 --> 18:00.870]  Oh man, there's so many good names still on the board. So many, and when I say good names,
[18:00.870 --> 18:07.610]  I mean literally good names. Yeah, you know, bass fishing. Uh, how do I want to?
[18:08.570 --> 18:14.230]  You know what? Uh, I'm going to go with Cade York because he just looks happy to be here.
[18:14.790 --> 18:18.630]  I think the commanders are not going to command themselves into the end zone all that often.
[18:19.730 --> 18:27.750]  And, uh, he just, he has a, he's got a chill vibe to him. Okay. He's got the mustache. Looks like a
[18:27.750 --> 18:34.950]  sheriff almost. I don't know. I'm liking Cade York. I guess he looks like the deputy who gets shot.
[18:36.190 --> 18:41.930]  He does. Yeah. He lives though, but he ends up, he gets shot in the, in the shoulder. Yeah. Oh,
[18:41.930 --> 18:47.290]  sheriff, we gotta stop him. At the end of the movie, he's, he's got a sling and you're like,
[18:47.350 --> 18:50.350]  oh, thank God you made it. They live. That's cool. They shot him in the gut,
[18:50.390 --> 18:56.410]  but he has a sling. That's cool. Uh, Gavin, I know you're really locked in on this right now.
[18:56.410 --> 19:00.450]  Locked all the way in. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But now it's time for you to make your next two
[19:00.450 --> 19:04.510]  picks. I'm now looking at the, you know, who's been picked so far and we've got some, you know,
[19:04.530 --> 19:09.030]  some childish giggle names. We've got Gay and Dicker. And I thought, let me find one of those.
[19:09.330 --> 19:17.810]  Right in between, we've got Harrison Butker. Oh, you do, you do. The Chiefs. That's pretty good.
[19:18.230 --> 19:22.730]  And, and, and it could be a death by a thousand cuts because it's going to, they're going to get,
[19:22.730 --> 19:28.410]  he's going to get a lot of point after. Yeah. One here and there, like over and over and over
[19:28.410 --> 19:38.470]  again. So. Interesting choice. So I've been gone for what, fucking two weeks or something. Yeah.
[19:39.230 --> 19:46.170]  I've been sick the entire time. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I picked up something in Detroit
[19:46.170 --> 19:49.990]  and I've been trying to get rid of it. Oh no. Hey, you know what? At least you're back and
[19:49.990 --> 19:55.030]  you just get to relax now, man. Yeah. Until like, I'm on a plane at noon tomorrow. Oh, right. Yeah,
[19:55.030 --> 20:00.850]  yeah, yeah. Gavin, have fun with that Butker pick. He's, he's been in the news a bit lately.
[20:01.210 --> 20:06.450]  Oh yeah. He made himself a real ass in the off season. I mean, surely for good things, right,
[20:06.530 --> 20:13.890]  Geoff? Yeah. He gave a speech at a, I believe it was at a college graduation that ruffled a few
[20:13.890 --> 20:22.410]  feathers. Yeah. What's he done? What? You didn't know about that? No. I mean, I expect Gavin to be
[20:22.410 --> 20:28.510]  on top of NFL news. Oh, he's sort of a, sort of a women belong in the kitchen and not at
[20:28.510 --> 20:34.810]  colleges learning kind of vibe. Yeah, I thought you'd like this. Real, real, real big in the,
[20:34.870 --> 20:41.130]  in the MAGA movement, I hear. Do you not? I thought this was like your boy right here, dude.
[20:42.050 --> 20:45.670]  I'm immediately going to distance myself from the boy he's picked, obviously.
[20:48.730 --> 20:53.530]  I'll say this. He's a really good kicker. I look at him and I'm like, he is great. God damn it.
[20:53.650 --> 20:57.410]  I, I, uh, I skipped over him, but yeah. I forgot about that. Thanks for taking him,
[20:57.470 --> 21:00.930]  Gavin. Yeah. We, I think everybody appreciates you taking him. Yeah. Yeah. Took a bullet there.
[21:01.210 --> 21:07.630]  Uh, this name's, it's messing with my brain because it's almost entirely Ray Narvaez,
[21:07.630 --> 21:15.590]  but it isn't. It's Brayden Narvaezon. A lot of the letters are in there. And he looks exactly like
[21:15.590 --> 21:22.810]  Ray. Yeah. You think he looks exactly like Ray? You think that's what Ray looks like?
[21:24.730 --> 21:29.510]  Twins. Do you know about that? Do you know about that kicker that looks like Ray?
[21:30.170 --> 21:36.290]  Did he punch a woman or something? No, what? Okay. Oh no, I was just prepared for the worst.
[21:36.970 --> 21:42.890]  What? Whoa. Why would you say that? Well, I have to butt kiss or whatever. Who'd I like to butt kiss?
[21:42.950 --> 21:47.530]  That's you, dude. I don't know what you're like. What, what are you talking about?
[21:48.990 --> 21:51.510]  Oh, I'm learning. What, what did he, what did this guy do?
[21:52.090 --> 21:56.090]  Nothing. He just looks like Ray. He didn't do anything. It's just that this is a,
[21:56.170 --> 21:59.770]  this is the NFL kicker that looks like Ray. Wow. He's got the wrong name.
[22:00.430 --> 22:04.850]  That's true. Rod the kicker three. And I don't think he, I don't know if he's even in the league
[22:04.850 --> 22:10.150]  anymore. He does look a little bit like Ray though, doesn't he? Yep. Yep. See, you think that's Ray
[22:10.150 --> 22:14.770]  photoshopped in there. It's not. That's just what the guy looks like. That's incredible. Yeah. Isn't
[22:14.770 --> 22:23.030]  that crazy? Isn't that weird? Wow. Why can't we pick him? Yeah. He's not in the league. Yeah. I
[22:23.030 --> 22:27.570]  don't know. He might be in the league, but he's not on this list. Ah, but Andrew, it's time for
[22:27.570 --> 22:32.030]  you to make your pick from who's on this list. Oh shit. It's my turn. Uh, that's how this thing
[22:32.030 --> 22:38.330]  has worked so far. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, I was caught up in Gavin, not knowing who Ray is.
[22:42.030 --> 22:45.750]  It's weird because they kind of work together. They, they're not very long though. It's not
[22:45.750 --> 22:50.870]  nearly as long as everybody remembers. No, that's true. It's fair. Uh, I think I'm going to go with
[22:50.870 --> 22:58.070]  some Mario Cardi, Joshua Cardi with the ramps. 25. He looks happy. I'm going with a good vibe squad.
[22:59.330 --> 23:05.510]  Joshua Cardi. He's got a big smile. He does. He also likes the name. I can't tell if he's got
[23:05.510 --> 23:12.730]  like the little chin goatee thing, but maybe it's just a shadow. Yeah. Kind of looks like Andy from
[23:12.730 --> 23:19.090]  Toy Story growing up. Yeah. About, about as much as Brayden, nervous and looks like Ray. Yeah. No,
[23:19.150 --> 23:26.230]  I think my comparable is a lot better than that. Whatever you say, man. It is what I say. Geoff.
[23:26.230 --> 23:32.230]  I'm going to go with a completely boring, uh, non-controversial or funny pick in any way.
[23:32.350 --> 23:38.450]  Jake Elliott for the Eagles. Okay. Go Eagles. He's going to get a lot of action. Yeah. I think,
[23:38.530 --> 23:47.650]  uh, I think you're probably right. Uh, I'm going with the Bears, Cairo Santos. I don't really have
[23:48.230 --> 23:54.990]  much of a reason. I think it's a great name. I think the Bears are going to, uh, you know,
[23:54.990 --> 23:59.070]  you got to pick, you got to pick someone who's still on. Cam Little got chosen. So what am I
[23:59.070 --> 24:05.550]  supposed to do? I'm going to go with Cairo Santos. Nick, you got to, you know, I'm going to go with,
[24:06.210 --> 24:12.430]  uh, I think from the Cardinals, Matt Prater. Cause I, I don't know that they're going to hit
[24:12.430 --> 24:17.910]  the end zone a lot, but if they do, at least I'll get the PATs then. Uh, old as fuck Matt Prater.
[24:18.010 --> 24:23.950]  I think he's 43. He's got a lot of experience, 481 kicks already. So it's a really nice way of
[24:23.950 --> 24:30.770]  saying old. Well, he's got some mileage. How about that? Uh, and then I'm going to go with,
[24:32.810 --> 24:38.570]  uh, the Browns. I have a feeling we keep going. How many we do it? Six.
[24:41.110 --> 24:47.000]  You've got to pick two more times, asshole.
[24:47.520 --> 24:53.060]  I think the Browns are going to be a shit show, but I think they're going to be in field goal
[24:53.060 --> 24:58.740]  range. Lucas Haverisk. Haverisk? Okay. We'll see how they do. I think you nailed it. Yeah.
[24:59.040 --> 25:02.360]  I think that's great pronunciation. I'm feeling confident. Loving my team.
[25:03.100 --> 25:14.520]  Now it's back to me. And I think, man, how about Jason Sanders for the Dolphins? Nothing
[25:14.520 --> 25:20.660]  funny about that pick, but if they score a lot of touchdowns, he'll give me some numbers,
[25:20.660 --> 25:24.820]  but if they're just in the range and they can't quite get there, I think he's going to be a guy
[25:24.820 --> 25:37.400]  that you see a lot of. Geoff. Uh, I'm going to pick Seahawks. Should be Jason Myers. Two-time
[25:37.400 --> 25:43.580]  Pro Bowl for Jason Myers. My pick. Feel pretty good about that. Yeah. Thank you. He's got a
[25:43.580 --> 25:50.460]  killer last name and first name. Yeah. It's a killer Halloween. He's unstoppable. Andrew,
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.800]  who are you thinking? Oh, this is really tough because there's, there's an important thing in
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.860]  this that you need to consider of, I'm going to be yelling potential. I need somebody's name that
[26:00.860 --> 26:06.580]  is fun to just yell. Yeah. Disappoint me or excite me. Probably disappoint me. I'm trying
[26:06.580 --> 26:13.560]  to decide if it's more fun to yell Lutz or group. It's tough. Well, you know, you have two picks.
[26:13.580 --> 26:22.560]  You can get them both in there. I'm not a swing fourth. Uh, I have two picks remaining. That's
[26:22.560 --> 26:32.000]  true. But I'm going to go with Lutz. Like, is what I said confusing in any way? No, I just was
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.700]  clarifying that, you know, I can't, I don't have a guarantee to lock them up. Gavin could swoop in
[26:36.700 --> 26:46.540]  and take some group. You know, I really like the look of Blake group. Yeah. He plays for the
[26:46.540 --> 26:52.380]  Saints. He does. He does play for the Saints group and he is Blake group. What a great pick,
[26:52.580 --> 27:00.580]  Gavin. That's really smart. What else is fun to yell? Uh huh. You've one more. You got one more.
[27:00.580 --> 27:10.780]  Oh yeah. Nick Folk. Oh, what's he on? The Titans. Titans. Titans. Look at his big,
[27:10.800 --> 27:17.240]  big jaw. Nick Folk kind of like cut out when you said it. So sort of sounded like you said Nick
[27:17.240 --> 27:24.340]  Fuck. You're picking Nick Fuck for the Titans. Uh, okay. Gavin's got all of his kickers locked up.
[27:24.440 --> 27:29.880]  Now it's time for Andrew to finally make his last pick. And you can't take groups off the list,
[27:29.880 --> 27:36.820]  dude. I don't like the look of Chad Ryland, just personally. Okay. Okay. I get it.
[27:38.260 --> 27:44.220]  Ah, man. Still a lot of kickers here that you can feel pretty good about. Yeah. You know,
[27:44.260 --> 27:49.120]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna do some bass fishing. I'm taking that Tyler Bass. Damn,
[27:49.200 --> 27:52.300]  that was gonna be my pick, man. That's a good, I think that's gonna be a good pick. I'm gonna
[27:52.300 --> 27:59.220]  like me some Tyler Bass. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's gonna be pretty good. Uh, how about you,
[27:59.220 --> 28:06.720]  Geoff? Oh my God. Can I, can I see who's left? I got Evan McPherson. Yep. Um, you also have,
[28:06.780 --> 28:14.700]  here's Austin Seabert. Austin Seabert or Chad Ryland. Uh, Chad Ryland,
[28:16.420 --> 28:23.660]  Kaimi Fairburn, Fair, yeah, Fairburn. Fuck. And Will Reichart, who is brand new and might die
[28:23.660 --> 28:29.200]  first. I'm not sure. That's tough, dude. Here's what I'm going to go with. I'm going to go with
[28:29.200 --> 28:36.300]  these are all fucking quarterback heavy teams. I'm going to go with Evan McPherson with the
[28:36.300 --> 28:40.260]  Bengals because I think there's a pretty good chance that Joe Burrow gets hurt. I think he
[28:40.260 --> 28:47.400]  might be glass. And so they may have to, they may have to lean heavily on their kickers. Uh,
[28:48.640 --> 28:56.460]  I am going to grab Kaimi Fairburn from the Texans. Uh, don't know who he is. Never heard of him.
[28:56.460 --> 29:02.060]  Don't care much for the Texans, but I'm going to lock him up and, uh, see if he brings me in those
[29:02.060 --> 29:07.300]  points. And Nick with the final pick of the kicker picker draft. Well, I'm going with the guy
[29:07.300 --> 29:11.900]  who's going to die first. That's Will Reichart from the Vikings. They play indoors. I don't like
[29:11.900 --> 29:15.480]  their offense, so I think they're going to have to settle for field goals a lot. And they play,
[29:15.540 --> 29:18.820]  like I said, they play inside, so it should be easier for a rookie to get some kicks.
[29:19.520 --> 29:26.440]  So I'm not going to go through who we've all picked. I think this is a pretty, I think it's
[29:26.440 --> 29:34.640]  the Jets, Austin Siebert, or the Patriots, Chad Ryland. Same division. Those are the two,
[29:35.200 --> 29:43.560]  and they are bad teams that are like notorious for falling apart. And those guys could be guys
[29:43.560 --> 29:48.800]  that you really hang it on this year. This might be the worst Patriots team in 20 years. Oh,
[29:48.840 --> 29:54.720]  isn't it awesome? It's the best. It's so fun to watch. God, it rocks. Chad Ryland looks like he
[29:54.720 --> 30:01.960]  was made in a lab to be the Patriots kicker. Dude, if that if that guy's not from Boston,
[30:02.100 --> 30:09.440]  he's going to fit right in. It looks like Mac Jones in disguise. I'm still useful. I'm going
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.880]  to kick them. He's going to shake everyone and just be like, you motherfuckers, you should've
[30:13.880 --> 30:20.680]  cut me. I'm back. I will say this respectfully about Austin Siebert. He looks like he is being
[30:20.680 --> 30:26.820]  used to promote that hair powder thing that we got for Does It Do? That is what the profile
[30:26.820 --> 30:34.520]  image looks like to me. Like he is a successful user. Those are our last two. I will say, Nick,
[30:34.520 --> 30:39.840]  with your pick, he might be the first to die or he'll be the psycho that makes it to the end.
[30:39.980 --> 30:43.820]  Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot of points there off that. I like that.
[30:44.400 --> 30:48.920]  I'm I feel confident. Speaking of that top pick thing, I forgot to mention to you guys
[30:48.920 --> 30:54.760]  when I was watching the Love Island UK season that I eventually bailed on to watch the U.S.
[30:54.760 --> 30:59.740]  because it was better this year. There was a dude who had kind of weird hair. And then I saw an
[30:59.740 --> 31:03.760]  interview with him later where he said like he put top pick on his hair the entire time he was
[31:03.760 --> 31:08.500]  there. Really? And that's why it looked weird. Yeah, I saw that. I saw. He's like, yeah, the
[31:08.500 --> 31:11.980]  production was really cool about it. They knew it was just like a thing I do. And like he was
[31:11.980 --> 31:16.680]  and I was like, fuck, that's the stuff we used. That works. You know, see it out in the wild.
[31:16.680 --> 31:21.240]  If it works, it works. How do you feel about your squad, Gavin? Oh, I'm going to win. All your
[31:21.240 --> 31:27.540]  research payoff? Yep. Locked in. Panthers, Jaguars, Chiefs, Packers, Saints and Titans.
[31:27.960 --> 31:37.340]  Not bad. Andrew's got Lions, 49ers, Commanders, Rams, Broncos, Bills. What are 49ers? What are
[31:37.340 --> 31:42.160]  49ers? They're minors. Yeah, they're minors. Yeah. Oh, really? OK. Yeah. They were the California
[31:42.160 --> 31:47.460]  Gold Rush. Got it. Oh, I'm getting the gold. Oh, this ties back to the Olympics.
[31:48.100 --> 31:58.000]  Uh, Geoff, the Raiders, the Colts, the Steelers, the Eagles, the Seahawks and the Bingles. I've
[31:58.000 --> 32:04.740]  got the Cowboys, the Chargers, the Falcons, the Bears, the Dolphins, the Texans and Nick. Ravens,
[32:04.820 --> 32:11.240]  Bucks, Giants, Cards, Browns, Vikings. I think they're a great, great disbursement all around
[32:11.240 --> 32:17.800]  from everyone. Very, very good for the kicker picker. Uh, Geoff is really close to going all
[32:17.800 --> 32:24.440]  animal. Oh, yeah. Whoa. It's too late. Well, I mean, the Raiders are like animals if you really
[32:24.440 --> 32:33.400]  look at them. You see the have you ever seen the super fan of the Raiders that dresses in the full
[32:33.400 --> 32:41.800]  gorilla suit? Oh, yeah. No, he's great. I love that. Uh, I they are man. They are a weird insane
[32:41.800 --> 32:46.340]  people. Yeah, they are. Yeah. I mean, they're Raiders fans. They're crazy to begin with.
[32:46.460 --> 32:55.580]  But like, man, they are truly an insane group. Now we need to make one. There we go. That's my guy.
[32:57.320 --> 33:00.600]  He's a super fan. Aren't you sad you didn't get this team, Gavin?
[33:01.840 --> 33:10.920]  Yeah. Uh, yeah. Now, before we're fully locked in, we need to make a decision because we have
[33:10.920 --> 33:17.420]  two kickers left. If a kicker gets hurt, which is going to happen to one of us, are we able to swap
[33:17.420 --> 33:21.660]  them or are we just locked in with what we have? I think we have to be locked in because I agree
[33:21.660 --> 33:29.240]  like so much of like the kicker stuff is going to change. It like their kickers on here that I didn't
[33:29.240 --> 33:36.000]  know that they were the kickers for their teams. Yeah. Uh, I was under the impression that the
[33:36.000 --> 33:44.420]  kicker for the Jets was Greg Zerline. I went off their depth chart. I mean, it might be right. He
[33:44.420 --> 33:48.940]  might have gotten knocked way down and he might not be the kicker there anymore. Maybe he's not.
[33:49.040 --> 33:53.000]  I was just under the impression he still was. Maybe he's not anymore. I mean, I bought I bought
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.840]  a movie that didn't frickin come out. I think if you get into a couple of movies, it's a great
[33:58.840 --> 34:05.500]  point. I also think it's not by team. Like if if Matt Gay for the Colts is out and they bring
[34:05.500 --> 34:09.640]  someone else in, you don't get those points. You got Matt Gay points, baby. That's it. Yeah.
[34:10.340 --> 34:12.940]  You're betting on the durability of your kicker. Exactly.
[34:14.200 --> 34:18.980]  Top of fair. That is a great point. We'll say the Packers pulled a fast one, cut their kicker,
[34:19.080 --> 34:25.080]  brought in a new guy like eight hours ago as of yesterday. What? Really? Yeah,
[34:25.080 --> 34:29.980]  I like I made the full list and then yesterday during the middle of the day,
[34:30.060 --> 34:37.480]  they cut the guy that I put on the list. It was listed. Wow. Oh, holy shit. That's crazy.
[34:38.200 --> 34:42.280]  Good luck, fellas. Yeah, no kidding. Oh, I'm excited to see how this all plays out.
[34:43.220 --> 34:48.980]  Thank you for watching this kicker picker draft. Somebody is going to make a website about this
[34:48.980 --> 34:54.260]  and keep track of how these scores go. Yeah, there will be updates in some fashion at some
[34:54.260 --> 34:58.960]  point in time in the future. Yeah. But now I'm excited. I got I got something to watch. I'm
[34:58.960 --> 35:03.700]  watching Red Zone, baby. I'm watching my boys. Hell yeah. NFL season starts next Thursday from
[35:03.700 --> 35:13.000]  this recording. So what's the first game? It's Chiefs versus Ravens. Ravens. Oh, wow. It's a
[35:13.000 --> 35:19.860]  classic Nick versus Gavin matchup, guys. It is. It's the duo that you love, Gavin and Nick
[35:19.860 --> 35:25.800]  together again in head to head competition. Bring it on. It's a kickoff. Oh, I got you.
[35:26.300 --> 35:34.920]  It's a kickoff. It's a kickoff. Well, thanks for watching this. Let us know who you think is going
[35:34.920 --> 35:41.700]  to win. Let us know who you would have picked. Go to Patreon.com slash the regulation pod. You can

[35:45.480 --> 35:54.040]  weirder stuff. So thanks for watching and we'll see you next time. Bye. All right. Can't believe
[35:54.040 --> 35:56.240]  it. Can't believe I picked this through the uprights.
