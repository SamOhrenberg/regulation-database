[00:00.000 --> 00:05.920]  Hello and welcome to the kicker, picker, re-picker, draft, pick, re-pick.
[00:06.400 --> 00:09.320]  You guys ready to get some new kickers?
[00:09.720 --> 00:12.160]  Are you? I'm so ready. I need some.
[00:12.880 --> 00:15.520]  Largely, I'm fine. I don't think we need to redraft these.
[00:15.560 --> 00:17.780]  Oh, no, no, no, no. We got to do a swap up.
[00:18.280 --> 00:20.500]  I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind swapping a dude out.
[00:20.840 --> 00:21.660]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:21.800 --> 00:25.120]  I think some of us are fine with the team that we have and we don't need to do that.
[00:25.440 --> 00:27.600]  So how many, how many are down a dude?
[00:28.120 --> 00:30.400]  Well, let's let's go right now. Let's open Nick.
[00:30.740 --> 00:34.000]  Let's start. OK, let's have a look at Nick, who's at the bottom with 215.
[00:34.460 --> 00:35.600]  Yeah. Having a good time here.
[00:35.820 --> 00:38.680]  Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. Well, Lucas, here's
[00:39.480 --> 00:42.160]  here's one guy who's just released. Yep. He's gone.
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.820]  The New York Giants kicker, Graham, Graham, you know, Graham Gano, whatever.
[00:48.280 --> 00:51.640]  You know, I don't think he's is he playing anymore?
[00:51.800 --> 00:53.860]  I think he's hurt. Hmm. OK.
[00:54.380 --> 00:55.940]  Yeah, me too. My own hurt.
[00:55.940 --> 00:59.340]  So Nick, Nick at a minimum needs to.
[00:59.620 --> 01:02.340]  But then also could probably use three because.
[01:02.800 --> 01:04.240]  Oh, yeah. Matt Prater is also hurt.
[01:04.540 --> 01:09.220]  Yeah. So half of Nick's team is maybe out potentially.
[01:10.460 --> 01:13.680]  That's tough. It's dangerous business being a kicker in 2024.
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.400]  Yep. However, Andrew is also in a similar boat where he's gone.
[01:19.840 --> 01:23.040]  He's released. And Jake Moody is hurt as well.
[01:23.040 --> 01:26.100]  That's tough. Yeah, that's really tough.
[01:26.260 --> 01:28.980]  At least he got you some points. Yeah, that's true.
[01:29.440 --> 01:31.140]  Gavin, you got a.
[01:32.300 --> 01:35.020]  Oh, shit. Your Green Bay kicker is released.
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.620]  Yeah, he's gone.
[01:36.880 --> 01:40.700]  And I think this guy's racist, but I don't know if that matters to him very much.
[01:40.860 --> 01:42.340]  He hates women. I don't know if he's racist.
[01:42.380 --> 01:43.740]  Oh, that's that's right. I'm sorry.
[01:44.120 --> 01:47.640]  Honestly, let me let me be the first to apologize, guys.
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.500]  When I said that I thought he was racist, I thought he was racist.
[01:51.500 --> 01:53.060]  I forgot he hates women.
[01:53.260 --> 01:56.200]  That's the thing to know about the kicker from Kansas City.
[01:56.500 --> 01:59.320]  Which is, to be fair, why Gavin picked him. Right.
[02:02.860 --> 02:04.420]  Having a Chicago shootout.
[02:07.620 --> 02:09.700]  Geoff, you're in second place, 295.
[02:10.280 --> 02:11.400]  You're sitting pretty, man.
[02:11.760 --> 02:13.040]  Yeah, I wouldn't mind.
[02:13.080 --> 02:16.540]  I wouldn't mind trading up on old Jake Elliott, who's a great kicker, by the way.
[02:16.580 --> 02:19.280]  He just doesn't get a lot of opportunity to kick in Philadelphia.
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.620]  Meanwhile, I'm feeling pretty good about my like.
[02:25.780 --> 02:28.980]  We got low performers here, but they're still getting me there.
[02:29.080 --> 02:32.980]  Really? I'm riding Dallas here because.
[02:33.160 --> 02:34.020]  You're riding Houston.
[02:34.580 --> 02:36.480]  Oh, look at look at this.
[02:36.760 --> 02:37.620]  Look, I'm just.
[02:38.080 --> 02:38.980]  You got horses.
[02:39.400 --> 02:40.560]  You got kicking horses.
[02:41.340 --> 02:46.180]  I got two strong Texas performers here, and I'm feeling really good about that.
[02:46.180 --> 02:47.460]  You got some donkey boys.
[02:47.920 --> 02:49.360]  I just got the big legs.
[02:49.740 --> 02:52.960]  You fucking know the donkey boys mount up.
[02:54.860 --> 02:55.900]  What's experimental?
[02:56.700 --> 02:59.200]  Huh? This is the extra point.
[02:59.480 --> 03:03.440]  Extra points made field goals made a field goals worth three points.
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.780]  An extra point is worth one.
[03:05.120 --> 03:06.800]  Yeah, but then they also have it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.040]  Here's how it would stand if it wasn't feels field goals is three.
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.360]  Oh, I like that much better.
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.180]  Uh, it's still hit the bottom.
[03:18.380 --> 03:19.460]  Yeah, man. Yeah.
[03:19.720 --> 03:21.460]  Yeah. Get rid of math works.
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.940]  Listen, I pick Dallas knowing that they're never going to score in the end zone.
[03:27.080 --> 03:28.000]  They'll just have to kick.
[03:28.100 --> 03:29.280]  They'll have to settle for field goals.
[03:29.940 --> 03:33.780]  So. So the other drop down is it's just like how many balls went over the.
[03:34.020 --> 03:36.560]  Yes. Yeah. Everything just counts as one here.
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.720]  OK. Yeah. Yeah. Which is not how I drafted.
[03:38.820 --> 03:41.600]  I drafted knowing that field goals were going to be worth more.
[03:41.600 --> 03:43.040]  Right. Same. Yeah.
[03:46.240 --> 03:48.820]  You're in a better position if everything's just one.
[03:50.340 --> 03:51.320]  Am I not in the same?
[03:51.640 --> 03:52.940]  Oh, no, because I'm third. Yeah.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.480]  So, Andrew. Yes.
[04:01.980 --> 04:04.080]  Shall we get to the reshuffling?
[04:04.700 --> 04:07.360]  Yeah, I think the first thing we do,
[04:07.480 --> 04:10.360]  I think everyone has to drop a kicker from their team.
[04:11.360 --> 04:15.340]  And anyone, if your people are hurt, you can just drop them as well.
[04:15.540 --> 04:17.220]  So I think Nick can drop three people.
[04:18.480 --> 04:19.740]  Would be the way to do it.
[04:19.860 --> 04:22.820]  And Geoff and Eric, even though you guys are doing great,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.620]  you're still going to have to drop at least one person to go into the pool.
[04:26.820 --> 04:29.640]  Now, let me now let me propose this instead.
[04:29.740 --> 04:31.480]  OK, I don't want to.
[04:31.800 --> 04:33.660]  Oh, that's too bad. That's unfortunate.
[04:34.160 --> 04:36.200]  That's OK. That sucks for you, dude.
[04:36.760 --> 04:38.400]  Well, drop Brandon Aubrey.
[04:39.660 --> 04:42.500]  No! So whoever they drop, can I pick?
[04:43.140 --> 04:45.020]  Yes. Potentially. Potentially.
[04:45.560 --> 04:47.200]  Now, how are we going to?
[04:48.100 --> 04:52.900]  Do that, Andrew, like, are we looking at like putting everything in a pool or what?
[04:53.080 --> 04:54.260]  Yeah, let's let's add.
[04:54.340 --> 04:57.480]  So there is a if you scroll to the bottom of the dock that you're on,
[04:57.960 --> 05:01.860]  we have a kicker re-picker, kicker re-picker section.
[05:03.480 --> 05:06.700]  Maybe whoever, and it won't be like fancy.
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.820]  These are replacements and dregs.
[05:10.120 --> 05:17.000]  Yes. But maybe we put the non-injured drop players into this
[05:17.000 --> 05:22.180]  and then they become draft eligible and we'll just mark whoever takes them if they do.
[05:22.740 --> 05:24.960]  And I'll I mean, I guess I'll just have to copy.
[05:25.080 --> 05:26.280]  I'm not really sure how this is built.
[05:26.440 --> 05:29.860]  I guess I'll just copy and paste these elements down here like this thing.
[05:29.980 --> 05:30.840]  I have no idea.
[05:31.360 --> 05:33.360]  Also, this is all fucked up.
[05:33.420 --> 05:34.080]  What the fuck?
[05:34.080 --> 05:35.360]  Yeah, this is all.
[05:36.180 --> 05:37.780]  Listen. Oh, yeah.
[05:38.100 --> 05:39.380]  What? Yeah, go ahead.
[05:39.860 --> 05:41.400]  Listen, I'm. Yeah, yeah.
[05:41.440 --> 05:44.780]  No, you already said, listen, now you go to the part where you tell me.
[05:45.180 --> 05:45.700]  Stretch out these.
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.520]  Yeah, I don't know that I think is isn't that going to move everything around?
[05:51.300 --> 05:52.260]  Just you know what you could do?
[05:52.420 --> 05:57.200]  You can copy 42 the line and just paste it several times underneath it.
[05:58.280 --> 06:00.140]  Oh, I can. Oh, this is so good.
[06:01.500 --> 06:03.720]  Now, Andrew said, listen, and I'm still waiting.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.000]  Good job.
[06:05.040 --> 06:08.060]  I was saying, listen, Nick's got it. Yeah, exactly.
[06:08.340 --> 06:10.680]  Nick took the words out of team.
[06:10.720 --> 06:11.560]  No bad ideas.
[06:12.040 --> 06:13.340]  Fully showing their force here.
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.120]  All right. All right.
[06:14.560 --> 06:16.200]  Team tape needs to fucking get it together.
[06:16.800 --> 06:17.740]  Showing the foreskin.
[06:18.880 --> 06:20.240]  Yeah, I heard that, too. Really?
[06:21.500 --> 06:22.760]  I did not hear that.
[06:22.960 --> 06:23.760]  No, me neither.
[06:23.900 --> 06:26.980]  And also, I feel like if Geoff heard that, he would have been the first one to call it out.
[06:27.440 --> 06:28.580]  I'm I'll be honest with you.
[06:28.580 --> 06:30.680]  I'm listening for foreskin talk.
[06:31.120 --> 06:33.100]  So it would it would have stood out to me.
[06:33.660 --> 06:35.260]  Geoff has an alarm in his office.
[06:35.460 --> 06:36.700]  It goes off.
[06:36.960 --> 06:39.840]  I've always got an ear out for foreskin time.
[06:39.940 --> 06:42.820]  It's like you can set Google alerts for specific searches.
[06:43.280 --> 06:43.520]  Yeah.
[06:45.660 --> 06:46.660]  Let's do this.
[06:46.920 --> 06:47.740]  Let's do this.
[06:48.220 --> 06:51.840]  Let's start at the top for who we're giving up and we can start listing them.
[06:51.920 --> 06:53.100]  I'll start listing them down.
[06:53.520 --> 06:57.360]  You tell me the team and the player, and that's how we'll do this.
[06:57.420 --> 06:58.780]  This is how we'll know who we're giving up.
[06:59.180 --> 07:00.320]  I'll go. Why don't you go first?
[07:00.320 --> 07:03.660]  Yeah, since I'm at the top and I will say.
[07:05.280 --> 07:11.480]  Miami Dolphins kicker Jason Saunders has been released from my team.
[07:11.800 --> 07:15.140]  Oh, it did. God didn't keep the formatting for any of this.
[07:15.340 --> 07:17.380]  That's OK. Great. Anyway.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.860]  OK, that's my release.
[07:19.960 --> 07:21.040]  I don't want to.
[07:21.320 --> 07:24.700]  He's just technically my lowest performing kicker.
[07:24.940 --> 07:27.880]  Yeah. Even though I should probably release my Bears kicker
[07:27.880 --> 07:28.780]  because they're fucking bad.
[07:28.860 --> 07:30.420]  But, you know, it is what it is.
[07:31.120 --> 07:32.260]  Now, second place.
[07:32.460 --> 07:35.060]  Geoff, you are releasing who?
[07:35.360 --> 07:37.540]  One player that I'm recommending.
[07:37.720 --> 07:41.220]  It's mandatory that you got to drop a kicker.
[07:41.380 --> 07:42.940]  I'm not doing it because I want to.
[07:43.040 --> 07:44.400]  So I'm just going to look at hard numbers.
[07:44.640 --> 07:48.560]  It's not an indictment on on his worth in my eyes,
[07:48.580 --> 07:51.780]  but I'm going to let go of Jake Elliott of the Philadelphia Eagles.
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.160]  There it is. Jake Elliott.
[07:53.760 --> 07:55.320]  Jake Elliott, you've been kicked.
[07:55.860 --> 07:57.480]  It's pretty good. I like. Oh, that's real good.
[07:57.480 --> 07:59.020]  Yeah, right. I'm pretty good.
[07:59.020 --> 08:03.260]  Honestly, I've been I've been pretty on fire with you are specifically
[08:03.260 --> 08:04.780]  the kicker picker with names.
[08:05.600 --> 08:10.700]  Next, Gavin, who will you be releasing to the pool and why?
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.960]  How many am I releasing?
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.740]  You have to release at least one.
[08:16.860 --> 08:18.600]  Well, I want to release the one that's
[08:19.460 --> 08:21.280]  gone or something. OK. Yeah.
[08:21.400 --> 08:23.080]  OK. Yeah. And who is that?
[08:23.520 --> 08:24.300]  Here you go, Gavin.
[08:24.640 --> 08:25.640]  I just linked it to you.
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.800]  Go take a look.
[08:30.740 --> 08:31.460]  Visit site.
[08:35.140 --> 08:36.260]  I want to release.
[08:36.880 --> 08:39.660]  Before this started, Geoff said, did we all do our kicker picker homework?
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.600]  And I said, absolutely.
[08:40.900 --> 08:42.280]  Gavin, you know, Gavin's locked in.
[08:42.720 --> 08:43.380]  Wait, that was homework?
[08:44.160 --> 08:46.480]  Well, you want to know what what you're walking into.
[08:46.640 --> 08:49.460]  So I looked at how all the kickers are doing and who I would want to switch out.
[08:49.980 --> 08:51.400]  Oh, you do? Made a list.
[08:51.580 --> 08:54.580]  I'm going to I'm going to boot out Brain of A.S.
[08:54.580 --> 08:57.380]  OK, OK. And what and what team is he on, Gavin?
[09:00.000 --> 09:00.480]  GGB.
[09:00.860 --> 09:02.080]  What's that? And who's that?
[09:02.440 --> 09:03.480]  Giant Bulls.
[09:03.500 --> 09:04.340]  OK, there you go.
[09:04.400 --> 09:05.540]  All right, Peckers.
[09:06.340 --> 09:10.260]  Technically, he was released from the giant balls on what Gavin is saying.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.940]  So, yeah, I would also.
[09:12.960 --> 09:13.920]  Oh, OK.
[09:14.300 --> 09:15.520]  For all the women out there.
[09:15.760 --> 09:17.620]  I want to release Butka.
[09:17.880 --> 09:19.420]  Wow. Yeah.
[09:20.300 --> 09:21.960]  Wow. Wow.
[09:22.980 --> 09:25.460]  That's it's a big that's a big move for you because that is
[09:25.460 --> 09:27.620]  that's the Gavin free apology tour.
[09:27.740 --> 09:32.200]  Yeah, he's he's he's a top three kicker for you, man.
[09:32.320 --> 09:35.260]  And Nick's going to snatch snatch that guy up like possible.
[09:35.680 --> 09:37.440]  Yeah, I think he's going to get snatched up.
[09:37.580 --> 09:40.800]  Oh, we don't call a massage and Nick for nothing.
[09:41.360 --> 09:42.460]  What the fuck?
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.560]  Without such a nickname, it's Nick Nick.
[09:45.920 --> 09:47.080]  We have to be careful.
[09:47.580 --> 09:48.920]  Nick's not going to play anymore.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.340]  Can you consider this now?
[09:51.340 --> 09:52.400]  This is ridiculous.
[09:52.420 --> 09:54.300]  I wanted to win and now I don't care.
[09:55.260 --> 09:59.020]  Sorry, I should refer to you as your other nickname, Milf Slayer.
[09:59.020 --> 10:04.820]  Yeah, I think last time we said that, he went, Don't tell my wife.
[10:06.640 --> 10:08.800]  Yeah, I probably whispered it to you.
[10:08.920 --> 10:10.500]  She's not going to play the last of us.
[10:11.120 --> 10:11.860]  Oh, my God.
[10:12.980 --> 10:15.320]  Andrew, Andrew, it's on to you.
[10:15.840 --> 10:16.900]  What are you thinking?
[10:17.080 --> 10:20.580]  How like, what do you what are you doing in Cade York to the curb
[10:20.580 --> 10:23.220]  like Washington did in week one?
[10:23.760 --> 10:24.840]  Yeah, get them out of here.
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.240]  I still believe in Jake Moody.
[10:26.340 --> 10:28.060]  I think he'll be back, even though he's hurt now.
[10:28.520 --> 10:30.540]  Yeah, I'm keeping I'm keeping Jake Moody.
[10:30.920 --> 10:32.360]  So that's the only drop.
[10:32.400 --> 10:34.960]  And you have you have a really strong group.
[10:37.840 --> 10:40.500]  Besides Cade York, like looking at your
[10:41.480 --> 10:45.600]  everyone is like really strong there, you could definitely get to the top
[10:45.600 --> 10:47.820]  of the board if you have someone strong for your pick.
[10:48.100 --> 10:48.760]  I think so.
[10:49.740 --> 10:53.680]  Um, and finally, what's up, Nick?
[10:54.900 --> 10:57.140]  Who are you releasing?
[10:58.240 --> 10:59.580]  We'll go one by one.
[11:00.600 --> 11:04.280]  Yeah. So you might not just don't even put these on the board.
[11:04.320 --> 11:04.780]  It doesn't matter.
[11:04.840 --> 11:09.160]  So I'm going to drop Lucas, have a have a risk, have risk it.
[11:09.200 --> 11:10.400]  And what team is that?
[11:10.620 --> 11:11.920]  That's Cleveland. OK.
[11:13.320 --> 11:17.060]  OK, and then I'd like to follow that up with the one
[11:18.420 --> 11:19.760]  Arizona's Matt Prater.
[11:21.140 --> 11:24.060]  He's a Prater guy followed by the Giants.
[11:24.260 --> 11:25.760]  Graham, you know, I think
[11:26.480 --> 11:29.060]  that your other kickers are all really good, too.
[11:29.420 --> 11:30.740]  They're excellent. Yep.
[11:31.920 --> 11:34.400]  Yep. Oh, my God.
[11:35.020 --> 11:37.040]  OK, maybe I'll have a shot now.
[11:37.320 --> 11:38.420]  Now, now here's the thing.
[11:38.960 --> 11:41.440]  Everyone is sort of off.
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.680]  Kilter now, because I only released one.
[11:45.680 --> 11:47.880]  I believe Geoff only released one.
[11:50.100 --> 11:52.820]  What, Nick, you only released one, Andrew?
[11:53.200 --> 11:54.080]  I did, yes.
[11:54.560 --> 11:56.560]  And Gavin released two.
[11:56.760 --> 11:58.760]  Two. Should I just release one then?
[11:58.860 --> 12:03.240]  Nick released three. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:03.440 --> 12:06.420]  You haven't having second thoughts about releasing the misogynist, huh?
[12:07.040 --> 12:09.320]  No, no, I was going to take the one that's gone back.
[12:09.320 --> 12:09.900]  Uh.
[12:15.820 --> 12:19.500]  So this is we're going to we're now in the reacquiring phase.
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.240]  The the picker, the re picker of the picker.
[12:22.300 --> 12:24.080]  How do you pick? Pick who picks first?
[12:24.240 --> 12:27.400]  Now this. Well, I think you should go to Nick first because he's last.
[12:27.480 --> 12:29.740]  However, yeah, let's do a little spicy wrinkle.
[12:30.420 --> 12:31.560]  Eric, can you pull up the wheel?
[12:32.100 --> 12:34.660]  Why I can't. I think the I think the wheel sounds like a great idea.
[12:34.820 --> 12:38.000]  Could you put let's do two steals to.
[12:39.580 --> 12:40.860]  Skips, if you may.
[12:41.100 --> 12:45.940]  So I just you want me to write steal and then steal and then skip and skip
[12:45.940 --> 12:49.040]  and then skip and then skip.
[12:49.380 --> 12:54.060]  OK. Now, Nick, still chained together is the image in the middle.
[12:54.200 --> 12:56.260]  That's pretty fantastic. I love it.
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.820]  So that's perfect. Well, I think that's pretty cool.
[13:02.400 --> 13:03.840]  Now, what would be fair?
[13:03.900 --> 13:07.300]  We all get one spin at the wheel if we want to take it.
[13:07.300 --> 13:09.160]  Would that be mechanically the way to do this?
[13:09.420 --> 13:14.200]  Would it be more fair just to put three Knicks, two Gavins, one Geoff,
[13:14.300 --> 13:17.040]  one Eric and one Andrew, and then you just spin it?
[13:17.580 --> 13:19.640]  Yeah. Why would that be more fair?
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.160]  Because then it's just random.
[13:21.560 --> 13:24.240]  But Nick has a greater chance and Gavin has a greater chance
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.260]  because it's weighted more in their favor, kind of like an NBA draft.
[13:28.480 --> 13:29.960]  But you don't have to spin the wheel.
[13:30.340 --> 13:31.260]  The wheel is optional.
[13:31.940 --> 13:34.480]  Yeah, it's just a it's just a way to randomize who gets it.
[13:34.820 --> 13:35.880]  What does the wheel do?
[13:36.480 --> 13:39.220]  So the the idea of the wheel is that if Nick wants,
[13:39.280 --> 13:43.580]  he can attempt to steal a player from any team or
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.620]  if it lands on skip, he loses his turn and it goes to the next person.
[13:49.800 --> 13:53.900]  So what's happened here is that there's a mechanic that Andrew has come up with
[13:53.900 --> 13:57.120]  that he has not told us about, and it involves stealing.
[13:57.360 --> 14:00.160]  To be fair, I was I was explaining it.
[14:00.200 --> 14:02.980]  And then we detoured into how to optimize the wheel
[14:02.980 --> 14:05.140]  while I was explaining the mechanics of it.
[14:05.140 --> 14:08.480]  I know we're just trying to pick who's going to go like, what order we go in.
[14:08.580 --> 14:12.040]  No, we're going from bottom to top because Nick is in dead last.
[14:12.140 --> 14:16.220]  So I think you should have first chance at the pool at the bottom.
[14:16.340 --> 14:19.760]  Can I just have it without any kind of, you know, penalty?
[14:20.040 --> 14:21.340]  Just let me have one.
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.180]  Well, it's your I think you have to decide if you want to gamble
[14:25.740 --> 14:30.120]  by taking any player available or going with the pool
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.020]  and then setting a limit to how many times we can spin.
[14:33.020 --> 14:35.240]  So that way you can't just spin every time.
[14:35.500 --> 14:37.860]  Yeah, this way it's way more sense than the other way.
[14:38.240 --> 14:40.620]  Well, you're you're solving a different problem, Geoff.
[14:40.840 --> 14:43.680]  This is that you're giving a solution for a different thing.
[14:44.440 --> 14:45.620]  I yeah, I guess.
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.800]  But so people are going to steal the people already on my team.
[14:49.140 --> 14:49.800]  Yeah, if they want.
[14:50.020 --> 14:50.800]  This changes.
[14:51.060 --> 14:54.200]  This changes the entirety of the whole point of the kicker picker.
[14:54.240 --> 14:56.380]  Now it's not who you think is the best choice.
[14:56.700 --> 15:00.580]  It's like if you got lucky and can steal from somebody else like that,
[15:00.580 --> 15:01.580]  that's a totally different game.
[15:01.720 --> 15:03.020]  Well, then throw away the wheel.
[15:03.080 --> 15:04.080]  Now it's the kicker knicker.
[15:06.080 --> 15:08.000]  So so should we do?
[15:08.340 --> 15:11.760]  I'm not saying I'm not saying we can't do it or I'm opposed to it.
[15:11.780 --> 15:14.940]  It's just a huge curveball to throw at us halfway through the season.
[15:15.260 --> 15:19.080]  It's well, listen, huge curveball for Nick losing three of his guys.
[15:19.220 --> 15:21.120]  Curves happen. Sports are unpredictable.
[15:21.680 --> 15:23.100]  You don't know what's going to happen left or right.
[15:23.320 --> 15:25.560]  Gavin doesn't even know the rules to the fucking game he's picking.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.340]  Yeah, but can teams actually steal a player?
[15:29.340 --> 15:32.000]  Oh, it's called. No, no, you can't steal a player.
[15:32.260 --> 15:33.400]  But this isn't the NFL.
[15:33.620 --> 15:35.640]  Also, just to clarify.
[15:36.440 --> 15:37.020]  What is this?
[15:37.380 --> 15:38.880]  This is the kicker picker re-picker.
[15:42.440 --> 15:45.180]  Sorry, I I went into this thinking it was the NFL.
[15:45.340 --> 15:46.000]  That's my mistake.
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.120]  Listen, I did the same.
[15:47.540 --> 15:50.180]  I just learned last week it's been a wild card.
[15:51.400 --> 15:54.320]  Eric, can you put two more steals and two more skips on the wheel?
[15:54.740 --> 15:55.560]  Now, why is that?
[15:56.500 --> 15:56.940]  Aesthetics.
[15:57.660 --> 15:58.720]  You just want to see it?
[15:59.960 --> 16:01.100]  Does that look cool?
[16:01.940 --> 16:02.580]  Really cool.
[16:02.700 --> 16:06.660]  Now, if we think that this ruins the integrity of the kicker picker as a whole,
[16:06.860 --> 16:09.360]  I'm fine with throwing it away.
[16:10.220 --> 16:13.720]  Well, the guy that doesn't know anything has a lot of opinions or.
[16:15.360 --> 16:18.300]  I was I was just trying to think of a fun way to spice it up
[16:18.300 --> 16:21.500]  middle of the season because the pool kind of sucks.
[16:22.240 --> 16:23.700]  The the re-pick pool.
[16:23.700 --> 16:27.460]  So the idea of the re-pick in the middle was to give teams
[16:27.460 --> 16:31.260]  at the bottom a chance to reclaim at the top.
[16:31.900 --> 16:34.160]  So I was trying to think of a fun way to do it.
[16:34.220 --> 16:36.920]  If anyone has any other suggestions, completely open to it.
[16:36.960 --> 16:37.940]  We don't have to do this.
[16:38.560 --> 16:41.460]  As it's floating out a wheel, because I love to spin a wheel.
[16:42.800 --> 16:46.120]  Yeah, I thought the wheel made a lot of sense to decide who picks next.
[16:46.460 --> 16:50.480]  I don't think that makes any sense in this context of the pool is shallow.
[16:50.900 --> 16:52.660]  So what if Eric goes first?
[16:52.660 --> 16:54.340]  Then I would love that.
[16:54.440 --> 16:55.660]  I think that's fantastic.
[16:56.080 --> 16:59.360]  That he would have nailed a one in because Nick has three names.
[16:59.360 --> 17:02.780]  I mean, how do you think the Detroit Pistons feel about getting the fourth pick
[17:02.780 --> 17:05.600]  of the draft every fucking year when they could just as easily get the first?
[17:05.680 --> 17:07.420]  But that's just that's just chance.
[17:07.540 --> 17:08.280]  That's how it works.
[17:08.740 --> 17:10.900]  Yeah, I'm the Detroit Pistons.
[17:10.900 --> 17:12.920]  Not in the NFL, though, which is what this is.
[17:13.100 --> 17:14.480]  The NFL is purely based on right?
[17:14.740 --> 17:16.340]  It's pretty clearly not the NFL.
[17:16.560 --> 17:18.020]  I think we all learned that earlier.
[17:18.340 --> 17:19.820]  This is the best, this is the best.
[17:21.180 --> 17:22.720]  Can I pick my guy now?
[17:22.840 --> 17:24.740]  I know we need to figure out what we're doing.
[17:25.080 --> 17:26.680]  You have to steal somebody from Andrew.
[17:28.740 --> 17:29.720]  I'm stepping back.
[17:29.880 --> 17:31.040]  We can get rid of the wheel.
[17:31.120 --> 17:32.080]  We don't have to use the wheel.
[17:32.240 --> 17:33.760]  I was just trying to add some spice to this.
[17:34.120 --> 17:34.840]  I love the wheel.
[17:34.940 --> 17:37.880]  I just thought what someone said about having Nick on the wheel three times.
[17:38.000 --> 17:38.780]  Yeah, let's do that.
[17:38.900 --> 17:39.980]  OK, well, let's do that.
[17:40.800 --> 17:41.160]  Great.
[17:41.700 --> 17:43.000]  Let's let's let's do that.
[17:45.120 --> 17:45.840]  Nick, Nick.
[17:46.000 --> 17:46.680]  Oh, hang on.
[17:46.860 --> 17:47.500]  There we go.
[17:48.320 --> 17:49.900]  Wait, they're all going to be side by side, though.
[17:50.120 --> 17:50.160]  Gavin.
[17:50.300 --> 17:50.820]  Oh, is that how?
[17:51.100 --> 17:52.200]  Oh, you're right.
[17:52.720 --> 17:53.680]  Well, you can shuffle after.
[17:53.940 --> 17:54.440]  Oh, you can.
[17:54.800 --> 17:56.400]  We'll pick how many times to shuffle.
[17:56.540 --> 17:57.600]  Gavin, you genius.
[17:57.740 --> 17:58.500]  Good, look at that.
[17:58.700 --> 17:59.100]  Oh, God.
[17:59.440 --> 17:59.800]  Geoff.
[18:00.160 --> 18:01.780]  But now Andrew's going to be mad.
[18:02.160 --> 18:03.240]  No, I'm good with it.
[18:03.680 --> 18:05.260]  I was just trying to add a suggestion.
[18:05.760 --> 18:08.480]  What if when it lands on you, it transitions to the second wheel?
[18:11.760 --> 18:13.780]  Consisting of steal and save or whatever.
[18:13.780 --> 18:22.560]  Like maybe like if if it lands on you in this wheel, you have the choice of accepting that choice or you can flip to the other wheel.
[18:22.640 --> 18:23.820]  You can't pick on this wheel.
[18:23.820 --> 18:25.240]  I don't know what's happening right now.
[18:25.300 --> 18:25.980]  Why not?
[18:26.280 --> 18:28.020]  Eric, what are you doing?
[18:28.300 --> 18:29.680]  Yeah, I'm just trying to spice it up.
[18:29.780 --> 18:31.920]  Mid-season re-picker kicker picker.
[18:31.960 --> 18:33.420]  We need two wheels now.
[18:35.220 --> 18:36.340]  I just...
[18:36.340 --> 18:37.440]  Is this our wheel era?
[18:38.040 --> 18:40.200]  What if it's steal, skip, or...
[18:40.200 --> 18:41.380]  Why does Gavin have two?
[18:41.860 --> 18:42.260]  Block.
[18:42.260 --> 18:44.580]  He gave up two guys.
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.780]  We'll just do Uno rules.
[18:48.060 --> 18:51.220]  Gavin gave up two guys. Wouldn't that be why he would have two?
[18:51.220 --> 18:52.180]  I thought it was based on standings.
[18:52.840 --> 18:54.680]  No, it was based on how many people you gave up.
[18:54.960 --> 18:55.700]  Based on holes.
[18:56.380 --> 18:57.840]  Yeah, he has two holes he has to fill.
[18:58.040 --> 18:58.840]  Okay, okay.
[18:59.020 --> 19:02.640]  So then when it lands on somebody, we can remove them from the wheel and then spin again.
[19:02.980 --> 19:07.180]  If anyone would like to release another player to get more wheel space, I'd say go for it.
[19:07.240 --> 19:07.960]  No, it's too late.
[19:08.740 --> 19:09.100]  Okay.
[19:12.090 --> 19:13.510]  So do you want me to shuffle this?
[19:13.970 --> 19:14.110]  Yeah.
[19:16.170 --> 19:20.350]  Before we do it, Andrew, are you happy with this version or do you want the second wheel to come into play?
[19:20.910 --> 19:24.150]  I don't understand the second wheel, so I think I'm good with this.
[19:24.610 --> 19:26.490]  The second wheel is your wheel!
[19:27.830 --> 19:28.190]  Oh.
[19:29.290 --> 19:34.230]  Well, I'm fine. We don't have to do it. It seems like there was a lot of resistance to what I was saying, so I'm fine dropping it.
[19:34.250 --> 19:39.390]  What if it's the second wheel, but it's harder to get the steal?
[19:41.230 --> 19:42.030]  I don't care.
[19:42.230 --> 19:44.270]  Like, steal would be one of four or something.
[19:44.270 --> 19:48.190]  I'm happy with whatever. I was just trying to add a fun wrinkle to the dumb game.
[19:48.330 --> 19:49.190]  I think it is fun!
[19:50.710 --> 19:52.770]  Not fun enough to be the wheel!
[19:53.250 --> 19:55.790]  It has to be a secondary maybe wheel!
[19:57.410 --> 19:58.710]  Wasn't it always a maybe wheel?
[19:59.930 --> 20:07.550]  Yeah, but now this is, no, we moved into a definitive wheel territory and it was chosen not to be the definitive wheel.
[20:08.070 --> 20:11.530]  It could still be. All I've done is put a wheel before your wheel.
[20:12.350 --> 20:16.010]  I'm good with the second wheel. I just don't want to overcomplicate this.
[20:16.510 --> 20:18.590]  Why would you want to do that?
[20:20.430 --> 20:22.850]  I'm known for being straightforward.
[20:24.210 --> 20:24.710]  Clear.
[20:25.290 --> 20:36.210]  I'm so happy that for the last five to ten minutes, it's just been this wheel spinning in circles and there are people watching this and it's just going.
[20:36.770 --> 20:38.910]  It's just going. This rocks.
[20:39.150 --> 20:39.990]  This is the best.
[20:40.250 --> 20:42.590]  So do we need a second wheel? Is that what we're doing?
[20:44.930 --> 20:47.130]  Tab a new wheel.
[20:47.630 --> 20:49.750]  I don't know if I can.
[20:50.510 --> 20:54.950]  But if this kept chained together, isn't it just gonna...
[20:56.470 --> 20:58.430]  Open a different browser with a VPN.
[20:58.910 --> 20:59.190]  No.
[21:00.770 --> 21:02.370]  Now, what's this wheel doing?
[21:03.710 --> 21:04.230]  Skips.
[21:04.910 --> 21:06.030]  Okay, cool. Good.
[21:06.310 --> 21:09.410]  I should also have a return to first wheel option.
[21:15.950 --> 21:19.910]  So it's skip, skip, steal, steal, skip, steal.
[21:21.250 --> 21:25.630]  Should there also be like a block one? Like you could get a card to stop a steal.
[21:25.930 --> 21:26.930]  Why would you block?
[21:27.530 --> 21:28.430]  You can't steal.
[21:28.830 --> 21:29.310]  Yeah.
[21:30.390 --> 21:31.950]  So you can't be stolen from.
[21:31.950 --> 21:33.850]  And you could apply...
[21:33.850 --> 21:34.910]  Wait, why does it say block one?
[21:35.230 --> 21:37.270]  Oh, you want like a get out of jail free card?
[21:37.810 --> 21:38.810]  I was just thinking block.
[21:39.410 --> 21:41.710]  Yeah, you hold it like a get out of jail free card.
[21:41.710 --> 21:43.730]  I like it. I like it a lot. That's great.
[21:44.290 --> 21:47.130]  Nick, are there any other things we should add here, Nick?
[21:48.350 --> 21:49.730]  Nick gets Eric's best kicker.
[21:49.830 --> 21:50.690]  Nah, I don't think so.
[21:51.330 --> 21:52.750]  I mean, that's what steal is for.
[21:53.730 --> 21:54.990]  Oh, yeah, that could be steal.
[21:55.110 --> 21:56.790]  Okay, let's do this.
[21:57.910 --> 21:58.850]  Let's spin wheel one.
[21:59.310 --> 22:00.290]  Hang on, Nick said ooh.
[22:00.590 --> 22:01.550]  Go ahead, Nick. What's up?
[22:01.550 --> 22:08.750]  What about like a chance spot where you have to leave one of your players on the board and whoever lands on it gets it?
[22:09.230 --> 22:10.290]  Oh, like a dropped...
[22:10.710 --> 22:11.070]  Yeah.
[22:12.630 --> 22:17.450]  So you pick one of your guys that you have to drop onto that spot and whoever gets it next gets that player.
[22:17.450 --> 22:19.250]  So on the wheel it would be forced drop.
[22:19.610 --> 22:20.210]  Forced drop.
[22:21.030 --> 22:23.030]  Ooh, what about lose a turn as well?
[22:23.830 --> 22:24.790]  Well, that's skip, isn't it?
[22:24.810 --> 22:25.270]  That's skip.
[22:27.870 --> 22:30.550]  Yeah, but lose a turn is like you lose your next turn.
[22:30.550 --> 22:34.930]  So this is your... you got skipped this turn, but then you lose your next turn as well.
[22:35.010 --> 22:39.750]  So if you land on lose a turn, you have to spin the wheel again to determine the current turn?
[22:40.470 --> 22:41.870]  The next turn you don't go either.
[22:42.990 --> 22:45.770]  You've already fucked up this turn by landing on the wrong one.
[22:46.210 --> 22:47.930]  I see. It's like a double lose a turn.
[22:48.050 --> 22:48.210]  Yeah.
[22:48.690 --> 22:49.410]  Oh, yeah.
[22:49.490 --> 22:51.150]  And Eric, could you put half a car on one?
[22:51.670 --> 22:54.550]  Yeah, forced drop, half a car.
[22:56.190 --> 22:58.450]  What's the other thing? Lose a turn.
[22:58.450 --> 23:01.910]  What's a turn? It's like lose two points.
[23:02.410 --> 23:03.130]  Spin again.
[23:03.450 --> 23:04.530]  Okay, spin again.
[23:04.810 --> 23:05.530]  Oh, spin again.
[23:05.750 --> 23:06.350]  That's good.
[23:07.330 --> 23:08.890]  See, this is what I like.
[23:09.290 --> 23:12.270]  And then one more entry that just says go to third wheel.
[23:14.730 --> 23:17.090]  And when we land on it, we'll figure it out.
[23:17.470 --> 23:19.750]  That's where the other half of the car is.
[23:21.470 --> 23:22.790]  What's half a car?
[23:23.410 --> 23:24.130]  It's a wheel of fortune.
[23:24.390 --> 23:24.890]  Wheel of fortune.
[23:25.270 --> 23:26.470]  Oh, my God.
[23:27.190 --> 23:32.350]  I like that we got rid of the wheel initially because it ruined the integrity of the game.
[23:32.950 --> 23:35.610]  We're just trying to accommodate you, man.
[23:35.710 --> 23:36.890]  Andrew, let me tell you.
[23:36.950 --> 23:40.250]  I was very interested to see how this was going.
[23:40.630 --> 23:44.370]  And then we started putting force drop and half a car on this thing.
[23:44.550 --> 23:47.430]  And now I don't care whether I win kicker picker or not.
[23:47.630 --> 23:49.390]  No longer matters.
[23:49.770 --> 23:50.890]  Not at all.
[23:53.130 --> 23:56.450]  I have a feeling we'll forget about kicker picker after this video.
[23:56.470 --> 23:57.650]  Absolutely not.
[23:58.430 --> 24:03.170]  If I spin the wheel and I get half a car, I'm going to get fully mad.
[24:04.130 --> 24:08.290]  If Andrew steals my best kicker that I picked, I'm going to come get it.
[24:08.290 --> 24:10.030]  I'm immediately checking out.
[24:10.510 --> 24:11.910]  Yeah, I'm not stealing from you.
[24:12.010 --> 24:14.050]  I know you'll get angry, but I'm going to take it from you.
[24:14.050 --> 24:15.410]  Well, I'm going to get mad, too.
[24:15.630 --> 24:17.250]  Yeah, but you're always mad, so it's fine.
[24:17.370 --> 24:18.470]  Alright, that's enough.
[24:18.690 --> 24:20.150]  Geoff gets a different shade of mad.
[24:21.830 --> 24:24.690]  Geoff gets a, I will stomp on everything, mad.
[24:25.030 --> 24:26.270]  It's not a fun...
[24:26.470 --> 24:30.530]  Geoff is really good at making things a bad time when mad.
[24:30.650 --> 24:31.770]  You're always mad.
[24:32.210 --> 24:34.090]  I have what's called an infectious mood.
[24:36.170 --> 24:37.550]  I'm going to shuffle this.
[24:37.890 --> 24:38.230]  Hell yeah.
[24:39.090 --> 24:40.070]  There we go.
[24:41.950 --> 24:42.470]  So...
[24:42.470 --> 24:43.490]  Now what?
[24:44.550 --> 24:47.130]  Oh, the force drop should also be your best performing player.
[24:47.890 --> 24:48.670]  Oh, shit.
[24:48.950 --> 24:51.730]  You've already put the rule on the force drop.
[24:51.870 --> 24:53.030]  We swapped wheels.
[24:53.210 --> 24:54.570]  He took his hand off the piece.
[24:54.570 --> 24:56.790]  Yeah, you're done, buddy.
[24:57.230 --> 24:58.950]  Okay, let's spin this stupid wheel.
[24:59.490 --> 25:00.410]  Wait, who spins first?
[25:01.510 --> 25:02.510]  What do you mean, who spins?
[25:02.850 --> 25:04.570]  What do you mean? We just spin this.
[25:05.330 --> 25:08.390]  I guess Nick can spin first.
[25:09.250 --> 25:10.270]  I would think that...
[25:10.270 --> 25:11.510]  Hey, Eric, will you push the spin button for me?
[25:11.510 --> 25:14.930]  Yeah, I would think that this is just whoever it lands on, it's their turn, right?
[25:15.230 --> 25:17.030]  Yeah, but who spun it? That's what matters.
[25:17.230 --> 25:18.170]  Okay, just making sure.
[25:19.470 --> 25:20.250]  Oh, shit.
[25:20.490 --> 25:21.590]  Who's it going to go?
[25:21.590 --> 25:24.270]  Oh, oh, oh.
[25:24.370 --> 25:25.550]  Oh, it's Gavin.
[25:27.010 --> 25:27.970]  Absolute horseshit.
[25:28.550 --> 25:30.330]  So now remove Gavin from the...
[25:31.390 --> 25:32.630]  Remove that instance, yeah.
[25:32.930 --> 25:33.930]  You got it, okay.
[25:34.370 --> 25:36.670]  So, Gavin, it's your turn.
[25:37.070 --> 25:40.970]  Do you want to make a pick or spin the second wheel?
[25:41.170 --> 25:42.110]  Is that how this works?
[25:42.210 --> 25:43.030]  I think so, yeah.
[25:43.490 --> 25:44.910]  You got it, you got it.
[25:45.430 --> 25:46.550]  Oh, I'm just going to pick.
[25:46.710 --> 25:49.370]  Who is the one that someone dropped that was good?
[25:50.450 --> 25:51.170]  Go ahead.
[25:53.310 --> 25:54.590]  I'll spin the second wheel.
[25:54.770 --> 25:58.210]  Okay, he's going to spin the second wheel.
[25:58.310 --> 25:59.610]  Oh, here it goes.
[26:01.090 --> 26:03.910]  Okay, say when, say when you want me to do it.
[26:04.330 --> 26:05.390]  3, 2, 1, go.
[26:07.970 --> 26:08.930]  Oh, shit.
[26:10.890 --> 26:16.050]  Oh, oh, Gavin with the steal.
[26:17.230 --> 26:19.010]  Do I remove it or do I keep it?
[26:19.030 --> 26:19.970]  Keep it, keep it, keep it.
[26:19.970 --> 26:24.170]  Okay, Gavin, you get to steal a player from any of the teams.
[26:25.250 --> 26:26.210]  Brandon Aubrey?
[26:27.910 --> 26:29.630]  Oh, he's taken from Eric.
[26:30.250 --> 26:31.490]  Is that what he's doing?
[26:31.890 --> 26:33.470]  Where do I list that?
[26:35.010 --> 26:36.510]  What do I do?
[26:37.090 --> 26:38.410]  You just change him to Gavin.
[26:38.730 --> 26:42.510]  No longer have Brandon Aubrey and now Gavin has seven kickers.
[26:43.010 --> 26:44.590]  No, I don't, I got five.
[26:44.730 --> 26:45.910]  Oh, right, because you're missing one.
[26:46.710 --> 26:47.370]  I missed two.
[26:47.370 --> 26:49.390]  We need to drop the ones we dropped.
[26:51.470 --> 26:53.390]  So now, Eric, you have four.
[26:55.330 --> 26:57.050]  Is this how you saw this going, Andrew?
[26:57.890 --> 27:01.210]  Okay, this is perfect.
[27:02.310 --> 27:07.890]  So now I have four, which I have to add my name here?
[27:08.970 --> 27:09.550]  I guess so.
[27:10.450 --> 27:11.630]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[27:11.630 --> 27:15.790]  Well, with this, it could go on forever if we just keep stealing from each other.
[27:16.910 --> 27:19.770]  That's why I said there'd be a cap on wheel spins, but it's fine.
[27:19.810 --> 27:21.690]  We're already locked in, we're spinning.
[27:21.930 --> 27:22.930]  Spin that wheel!
[27:24.370 --> 27:24.790]  Okay.
[27:25.770 --> 27:27.330]  Hey, look, you guys wanted the second wheel.
[27:28.310 --> 27:30.640]  If you land on you...
[27:36.050 --> 27:39.010]  Do you want to go to the second wheel?
[27:39.430 --> 27:41.210]  I'll be popping over to that second wheel, I think.
[27:41.760 --> 27:41.990]  Alright.
[27:48.350 --> 27:50.430]  Alright, you let me know when you're ready.
[27:50.570 --> 27:51.160]  3, 2, 1, go!
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.300]  Force drop!
[28:06.040 --> 28:08.300]  It's gotta be his number one player.
[28:08.800 --> 28:09.460]  Oh my God.
[28:09.760 --> 28:10.390]  So that would be...
[28:12.080 --> 28:13.000]  Brandon Aubrey.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.420]  So Brandon Aubrey is now in the free pool.
[28:18.090 --> 28:19.190]  He's in the free pool.
[28:19.980 --> 28:23.370]  And now Gavin gets added back into the wheel again.
[28:26.780 --> 28:29.420]  But doesn't he have to get added in twice?
[28:31.080 --> 28:32.160]  How many...
[28:32.160 --> 28:33.600]  Because he lost...
[28:34.030 --> 28:34.720]  Yeah, he does.
[28:35.140 --> 28:35.600]  Yeah, he does.
[28:35.600 --> 28:36.160]  Oh, you're right.
[28:36.360 --> 28:38.300]  He doesn't have enough kickers.
[28:38.440 --> 28:40.000]  Because he's lost two again.
[28:42.040 --> 28:42.820]  Gavin, Gavin!
[28:42.840 --> 28:43.400]  Spin the wheel!
[28:44.320 --> 28:45.280]  Double spin!
[28:45.620 --> 28:46.140]  Spin the wheel!
[28:46.140 --> 28:48.500]  Wait, no! Shuffle again, shuffle again!
[28:48.580 --> 28:48.860]  No!
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.760]  We're all grouped!
[28:52.600 --> 28:54.120]  Oh wait, yeah, that's good.
[28:54.880 --> 28:58.900]  Nick, do you want to spin the second wheel?
[29:00.160 --> 29:01.220]  No, thank you.
[29:01.340 --> 29:03.720]  I mean, in the interest of time, I'm gonna get Brandon Aubrey.
[29:07.880 --> 29:08.360]  Okay.
[29:09.400 --> 29:12.240]  Brandon Aubrey, move it all over the place.
[29:16.140 --> 29:18.100]  This is never gonna end.
[29:18.380 --> 29:19.440]  There we go!
[29:19.780 --> 29:20.660]  Spinning the wheel!
[29:21.220 --> 29:21.980]  I blame Andrew.
[29:23.020 --> 29:24.460]  I'll take blame, this is great.
[29:26.040 --> 29:26.840]  Yeah, Nick!
[29:27.240 --> 29:27.640]  Nick!
[29:29.100 --> 29:31.560]  Do you want to make a pick or go to the second wheel?
[29:32.920 --> 29:34.540]  I'm gonna keep moving and make a pick.
[29:34.640 --> 29:36.700]  I'm gonna get Austin Siebert from Washington.
[29:37.060 --> 29:37.980]  Make it a free pick.
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.060]  He's just backing up.
[29:42.160 --> 29:43.160]  Is it like this?
[29:43.240 --> 29:43.960]  I don't know how to spell this.
[29:44.260 --> 29:45.480]  Uh, S-E-I, S-E-I.
[29:45.580 --> 29:45.840]  It's fine.
[29:47.880 --> 29:49.360]  Geoff's like, it's close enough, whatever.
[29:50.360 --> 29:51.320]  Spin the wheel!
[29:52.400 --> 29:54.120]  Should I shuffle again or are we good?
[29:54.580 --> 29:54.800]  Shuffle.
[29:55.000 --> 29:56.560]  So Nick's now down to one name.
[29:56.880 --> 29:57.060]  Yeah.
[29:57.280 --> 29:57.660]  Yeah, one name.
[30:02.340 --> 30:02.800]  Oh!
[30:06.360 --> 30:06.860]  Eric!
[30:08.600 --> 30:09.180]  Uh-oh.
[30:09.780 --> 30:11.860]  He's spinning the second wheel?
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.240]  I'm having a look.
[30:13.540 --> 30:15.040]  Who do we have available?
[30:18.280 --> 30:21.200]  Honestly, I'm not really liking what we have here.
[30:21.980 --> 30:23.520]  You gotta spin that second wheel.
[30:23.520 --> 30:24.720]  You can always do that second wheel.
[30:24.940 --> 30:27.140]  I'm thinking about spinning the second wheel.
[30:29.560 --> 30:30.060]  Spin it!
[30:31.380 --> 30:32.220]  Spin it!
[30:32.500 --> 30:34.820]  If he gets Brandon Aubrey back, I'm gonna lose it.
[30:36.460 --> 30:37.620]  Oh no, okay.
[30:37.920 --> 30:39.060]  I'm gonna spin the wheel!
[30:39.060 --> 30:40.200]  You gotta have a car!
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.240]  I don't want...
[30:41.240 --> 30:43.340]  I don't want...
[30:43.340 --> 30:44.720]  So it's a skip, right?
[30:44.920 --> 30:45.020]  I have a car.
[30:45.020 --> 30:46.120]  It's just a skip!
[30:48.620 --> 30:50.940]  But I'm off the other board!
[30:51.400 --> 30:52.400]  It's just a score!
[30:53.560 --> 30:55.680]  You gotta be added back in, I guess.
[30:55.700 --> 30:56.520]  You gotta go back on.
[30:58.280 --> 30:59.720]  That's why I think this never ends.
[30:59.720 --> 31:00.140]  Spin the wheel!
[31:06.740 --> 31:08.440]  Oh my god!
[31:09.280 --> 31:09.400]  Geez!
[31:09.720 --> 31:11.720]  Spin that second wheel, baby.
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.440]  Hang on, I gotta remove him.
[31:17.900 --> 31:19.700]  It's three kicker pickers!
[31:20.140 --> 31:21.980]  Now add him back in!
[31:22.580 --> 31:23.480]  No, it's a steal.
[31:23.620 --> 31:24.340]  It's a steal!
[31:25.380 --> 31:26.780]  Only if a Brandon Aubrey...
[31:49.310 --> 31:50.310]  Spin the wheel!
[31:54.370 --> 31:55.430]  Spin the wheel!
[31:56.010 --> 31:57.030]  We must be stopped.
[31:59.470 --> 32:00.710]  Spin the wheel!
[32:06.460 --> 32:07.480]  Son of a bitch!
[32:07.480 --> 32:11.180]  Nick, you wanna make a pick? You wanna spin that second wheel?
[32:11.180 --> 32:13.140]  Oh, fuck yeah, let's spin the second wheel!
[32:14.320 --> 32:16.540]  Oh, Geoff hasn't done anything yet!
[32:28.800 --> 32:30.680]  My fucking stomach hurts!
[32:38.020 --> 32:38.680]  He's gone!
[32:40.120 --> 32:41.000]  He's gone!
[32:41.460 --> 32:43.140]  Alright, add him back to the wheel.
[32:55.580 --> 32:56.800]  Come on, Eric!
[32:57.560 --> 32:58.400]  Oh, man.
[32:59.760 --> 33:01.440]  Well, you know what I gotta do.
[33:01.660 --> 33:03.700]  I already got half the car, I gotta get the other half.
[33:03.780 --> 33:04.540]  Let's spin that wheel.
[33:11.120 --> 33:11.860]  Spin him!
[33:13.780 --> 33:15.960]  One more time.
[33:16.080 --> 33:17.080]  I'm light-headed.
[33:23.320 --> 33:27.500]  It turned to first wheel!
[33:27.940 --> 33:28.540]  Spin it!
[33:30.780 --> 33:34.300]  So I need to get added back on here.
[33:34.580 --> 33:35.060]  Yeah!
[33:37.900 --> 33:39.320]  Oh, my God.
[33:42.230 --> 33:44.100]  Damn that second wheel.
[33:45.240 --> 33:45.900]  Geoff!
[33:46.160 --> 33:46.780]  Oh, shit!
[33:47.380 --> 33:49.580]  Oh, boy.
[33:50.700 --> 33:51.940]  Big decision, Geoff.
[33:52.380 --> 33:55.660]  I'm gonna take Dustin Hopkins for the Cleveland Browns.
[33:57.780 --> 33:58.740]  Good pick.
[33:59.220 --> 34:01.940]  And then somebody can take him back from me whenever.
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.540]  What's his name? Dustin Hopkins?
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.080]  Yeah, I assume he's on the bottom somewhere.
[34:07.860 --> 34:08.260]  Let's see.
[34:08.820 --> 34:09.260]  He is.
[34:10.020 --> 34:10.800]  Is he? Okay, cool.
[34:11.120 --> 34:12.380]  That's Browns, Dustin Hopkins.
[34:12.940 --> 34:13.320]  Geoff!
[34:13.940 --> 34:14.860]  Way to go.
[34:15.040 --> 34:15.600]  Alright, guys.
[34:15.600 --> 34:15.960]  Great pick.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.300]  Geoff is now off the board.
[34:24.490 --> 34:25.410]  It's Gavin.
[34:25.650 --> 34:27.690]  Jesus Christ, I still haven't gotten to spin.
[34:28.210 --> 34:29.950]  Gavin, what do you think?
[34:35.770 --> 34:39.270]  Let me look at this list.
[34:45.310 --> 34:50.110]  Oh, Christ, it hurts.
[34:53.170 --> 34:54.170]  So, Gano?
[34:55.590 --> 34:56.330]  Graham Gano?
[34:56.730 --> 34:57.850]  Graham Gano, yeah.
[34:58.630 --> 34:59.490]  Where was he before?
[35:00.910 --> 35:01.410]  Is he hurt?
[35:02.150 --> 35:03.510]  I think he's just...
[35:03.510 --> 35:05.170]  I think he's hurt.
[35:05.230 --> 35:05.470]  He sucks.
[35:05.850 --> 35:06.610]  Does he suck?
[35:07.170 --> 35:08.190]  I think he sucks.
[35:08.290 --> 35:09.310]  Let me look up Graham Gano.
[35:10.070 --> 35:10.330]  Here.
[35:11.550 --> 35:12.630]  Yeah, he just sucks.
[35:14.430 --> 35:15.350]  There's his line.
[35:15.590 --> 35:16.310]  He better be hurt.
[35:17.430 --> 35:18.230]  Yeah, exactly.
[35:19.530 --> 35:21.570]  Were you just picking based on vibes or what?
[35:21.570 --> 35:23.890]  I was just trying to remember who's been released.
[35:24.450 --> 35:26.430]  Anyone that's in the small print down here.
[35:26.650 --> 35:27.550]  Yeah, he's hurt.
[35:27.790 --> 35:30.110]  Yeah, but some people were just dropped for drop's sake.
[35:30.370 --> 35:31.030]  And some people were hurt.
[35:31.450 --> 35:31.850]  Oh, yeah.
[35:36.680 --> 35:37.720]  So, what's your move?
[35:38.600 --> 35:40.200]  I'll take Harrison Butka.
[35:40.540 --> 35:42.500]  I guess screw you, women.
[35:42.800 --> 35:44.140]  You're putting him back on the team?
[35:44.420 --> 35:45.140]  Putting him back on?
[35:46.420 --> 35:46.860]  You.
[35:48.280 --> 35:49.160]  Cold move.
[35:57.120 --> 35:57.560]  Oh.
[35:58.880 --> 36:00.740]  Oh, you fucker.
[36:00.980 --> 36:02.600]  Well, we're back to the spin.
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.400]  Down to the final three people.
[36:10.910 --> 36:12.030]  Might be Andrew.
[36:12.790 --> 36:13.050]  It's Nick.
[36:13.070 --> 36:13.610]  It's not.
[36:15.410 --> 36:17.630]  Well, I'm not going to spin the second wheel.
[36:17.790 --> 36:17.930]  No?
[36:18.070 --> 36:21.230]  And I'm going to pick up Joey Sly from the New England Patriots.
[36:21.350 --> 36:21.630]  Oh.
[36:22.310 --> 36:23.430]  How many people do you have now, Nick?
[36:24.290 --> 36:24.650]  Five.
[36:29.390 --> 36:32.130]  I had six, and Gavin showed up.
[36:32.550 --> 36:34.090]  It's S-L-Y-E.
[36:34.570 --> 36:34.970]  Thank you.
[36:34.970 --> 36:35.530]  It's a great name.
[36:36.150 --> 36:36.930]  Joey Sly.
[36:36.990 --> 36:37.430]  Great name.
[36:37.630 --> 36:37.990]  All right.
[36:38.210 --> 36:41.590]  Same name as a punk rock singer who died a couple years ago.
[36:41.670 --> 36:41.990]  Oh, really?
[36:42.110 --> 36:42.310]  Really.
[36:42.890 --> 36:48.030]  So, now, we're down to two Erics, one Andrew, and one Nick.
[36:48.130 --> 36:50.350]  I don't think I've gotten the pick yet for anything.
[36:50.350 --> 36:50.470]  No.
[36:50.470 --> 36:51.030]  I don't think so.
[36:51.110 --> 36:51.610]  Absolutely not.
[36:51.730 --> 36:52.390]  I think I'm the only one who hasn't won.
[36:52.390 --> 36:53.830]  But I think that ends now.
[36:54.570 --> 36:54.930]  Oh!
[36:57.750 --> 36:59.250]  Well, I gotta spin the second wheel.
[36:59.370 --> 37:00.790]  I just want to get in on it a little bit.
[37:00.910 --> 37:00.990]  You gotta spin the second wheel!
[37:00.990 --> 37:02.570]  I gotta spin it at least once.
[37:03.170 --> 37:04.030]  You gotta know what it's like.
[37:04.030 --> 37:05.690]  I just gotta have some of that second wheel fun.
[37:07.830 --> 37:08.190]  Skip.
[37:08.370 --> 37:09.630]  Please skip.
[37:10.050 --> 37:10.790]  Oh, no!
[37:12.390 --> 37:12.750]  Steal!
[37:14.730 --> 37:16.650]  Okay, give me a second to look at everyone's list.
[37:16.770 --> 37:17.130]  Absolutely.
[37:17.470 --> 37:19.150]  Hey, take your time, buddy.
[37:19.310 --> 37:20.170]  Oh, man.
[37:22.510 --> 37:23.710]  I know who I'd steal.
[37:23.710 --> 37:24.850]  Yeah, me too.
[37:26.650 --> 37:31.770]  I think I'm gonna steal the woman hater from Gavin, Harrison Butker.
[37:32.110 --> 37:33.510]  Give me that bub boy.
[37:33.650 --> 37:35.090]  Wow, you took him out of my team?
[37:35.330 --> 37:35.670]  Yeah.
[37:36.350 --> 37:36.970]  Give him back.
[37:37.570 --> 37:37.970]  Gavin's back on the board.
[37:37.970 --> 37:39.050]  To me, who I never had.
[37:39.130 --> 37:39.930]  I don't know why I said back.
[37:40.330 --> 37:41.390]  Give him back.
[37:41.970 --> 37:42.390]  I never had.
[37:42.390 --> 37:43.870]  Gavin, back on the board!
[37:45.530 --> 37:46.750]  Alright, here we go!
[37:47.950 --> 37:50.110]  Put another bullet in a loaded gun.
[37:52.210 --> 37:52.690]  Oh!
[37:52.690 --> 37:54.030]  This could be it.
[37:54.070 --> 37:54.830]  Nick could be done.
[37:55.470 --> 37:56.810]  Spin the wheel, Eric.
[37:57.110 --> 37:58.770]  Are we spinning that second wheel, Nick?
[37:58.890 --> 37:59.290]  Yeah.
[37:59.870 --> 38:00.710]  Oh, God.
[38:05.260 --> 38:06.840]  Oh, no, stop!
[38:07.460 --> 38:07.840]  Stop!
[38:08.060 --> 38:08.380]  Skip!
[38:08.560 --> 38:09.460]  Fuck, skip!
[38:09.600 --> 38:11.540]  Add his dumb ass back to the wheel.
[38:13.840 --> 38:15.860]  Now, if it lands on him, you just spin it again.
[38:17.240 --> 38:18.040]  Oh, God.
[38:18.260 --> 38:18.420]  What?
[38:18.500 --> 38:19.280]  No, it's just skip.
[38:19.440 --> 38:20.340]  Not lose a turn.
[38:20.340 --> 38:21.740]  It's a double skip, isn't it?
[38:22.220 --> 38:22.480]  No.
[38:22.540 --> 38:23.700]  No, that's lose a turn.
[38:24.360 --> 38:25.420]  Oh, it's Eric!
[38:26.380 --> 38:28.100]  Oh, he's gonna spin that fucking wheel.
[38:28.340 --> 38:30.940]  Oh, guys, you know I gotta spin that second wheel.
[38:32.580 --> 38:34.100]  We are making progress, though.
[38:34.460 --> 38:34.940]  We are.
[38:35.340 --> 38:35.760]  I didn't think we would.
[38:35.760 --> 38:36.560]  The first wheel's pretty small.
[38:36.880 --> 38:38.180]  I didn't think we would, but we are.
[38:38.860 --> 38:39.340]  Skip!
[38:44.420 --> 38:45.840]  Back to the wheel.
[38:46.040 --> 38:46.920]  Back on the wheel.
[38:47.920 --> 38:48.940]  Unless we're making progress.
[38:51.420 --> 38:52.380]  I mean...
[38:53.140 --> 38:54.960]  He got it again!
[38:55.260 --> 38:55.860]  Eric wins it!
[38:56.060 --> 38:56.660]  It's Eric!
[38:57.140 --> 38:57.860]  Let me keep my...
[38:57.860 --> 38:58.440]  What are you gonna do?
[38:58.520 --> 38:59.560]  I'm gonna remove myself here.
[38:59.840 --> 39:01.760]  Oh, you do that second wheel?
[39:02.240 --> 39:04.120]  You absolute...
[39:12.090 --> 39:13.990]  He got four strokes!
[39:16.030 --> 39:17.770]  He lost the game!
[39:21.310 --> 39:22.510]  Oh, shit!
[39:23.010 --> 39:24.210]  Cairo Santos!
[39:24.650 --> 39:24.970]  No!
[39:25.510 --> 39:27.290]  I thought you had to drop your best player.
[39:27.470 --> 39:28.630]  I thought it's the best player.
[39:29.270 --> 39:29.570]  What?
[39:30.110 --> 39:32.330]  I'm pretty sure we said you have to force drop your best player.
[39:33.110 --> 39:35.070]  No, that was a thing Nick added later.
[39:35.630 --> 39:37.710]  Yeah, but we followed it when Gavin went.
[39:38.150 --> 39:38.730]  Yeah, didn't I?
[39:39.090 --> 39:39.890]  Is that what you did?
[39:39.930 --> 39:40.990]  Did you drop your best player?
[39:41.610 --> 39:42.710]  I dropped Brandon Aubrey.
[39:43.690 --> 39:44.670]  Oh, wait, did he get stolen?
[39:44.830 --> 39:45.170]  I don't remember.
[39:45.330 --> 39:46.310]  No, he got stolen.
[39:46.630 --> 39:47.570]  I don't think we did.
[39:47.910 --> 39:52.050]  I don't think we did it by best player, but I'll do it just in the interest of moving this along.
[39:55.090 --> 39:55.530]  So...
[39:59.010 --> 40:01.990]  Texan's kicker, Kiami Fairbairn.
[40:02.090 --> 40:03.790]  I wish I was back on the wheel.
[40:03.950 --> 40:05.830]  Of course, now Eric's back on the wheel.
[40:06.370 --> 40:07.170]  I'm here twice.
[40:07.530 --> 40:08.470]  Oh, he's back on it twice!
[40:09.830 --> 40:11.190]  Let's spin that wheel!
[40:11.890 --> 40:12.910]  Oh, land on me.
[40:15.710 --> 40:16.150]  Well...
[40:17.170 --> 40:17.610]  Alright!
[40:18.150 --> 40:19.270]  Eric, are you going to go from the pool?
[40:19.650 --> 40:21.410]  I'm going to go ahead and go to the pool.
[40:22.130 --> 40:24.070]  I'm going to trap Kiami Fairbairn.
[40:26.490 --> 40:27.010]  Remove!
[40:27.230 --> 40:28.430]  Let's spin again!
[40:29.510 --> 40:31.010]  Oh, I should have shit before that.
[40:32.430 --> 40:33.790]  When will you learn, man?
[40:33.790 --> 40:34.490]  Here goes Nick!
[40:34.690 --> 40:35.050]  Nick!
[40:35.670 --> 40:36.190]  Alright.
[40:37.390 --> 40:38.510]  Spin the second wheel, Eric.
[40:40.110 --> 40:41.490]  You got it, buddy.
[40:42.970 --> 40:43.490]  Goddamn.
[40:44.430 --> 40:47.710]  People will watch this and wonder why... wonder how it's...
[40:47.710 --> 40:48.730]  Yeah!
[40:50.090 --> 40:51.970]  Nick won the other half of the car!
[40:52.630 --> 40:53.150]  What's...
[40:53.150 --> 40:54.610]  So let's go to third wheel!
[40:55.130 --> 40:56.790]  I think it's just the other half of the car.
[40:57.090 --> 40:58.510]  No, no, no. We have to make the third wheel.
[40:58.790 --> 40:59.990]  What's the third wheel?
[41:03.730 --> 41:05.090]  What's the third wheel, guys?
[41:05.570 --> 41:07.910]  Uh, it's other half of car.
[41:08.250 --> 41:08.950]  Other half of car.
[41:09.550 --> 41:11.350]  I think, uh, twenty bucks.
[41:11.930 --> 41:12.130]  Okay.
[41:12.270 --> 41:14.130]  You have to buy every...
[41:14.130 --> 41:16.550]  You pick what everybody eats for dinner.
[41:17.410 --> 41:17.850]  Okay.
[41:17.870 --> 41:18.810]  Yeah, you pick dinner.
[41:20.810 --> 41:21.250]  Um...
[41:21.250 --> 41:22.610]  Lose three turns.
[41:23.010 --> 41:25.430]  No, let's...
[41:25.430 --> 41:26.530]  Shut up.
[41:26.910 --> 41:28.290]  Go back to second wheel.
[41:28.730 --> 41:31.310]  Yeah, hang on. Go back to first wheel.
[41:32.150 --> 41:34.950]  And then for the final one, uh, full team drop.
[41:37.730 --> 41:39.230]  That is insane.
[41:40.050 --> 41:41.010]  That's no...
[41:41.010 --> 41:43.530]  Alright, Nick! Are you ready to spin the third wheel?
[41:44.630 --> 41:45.850]  Yeah, go ahead and spin it.
[41:45.930 --> 41:48.790]  Let me know when anything but full team drop.
[41:48.910 --> 41:49.370]  Just spin the wheel.
[41:49.370 --> 41:50.630]  Just spin the wheel.
[41:50.750 --> 41:52.750]  I took my glasses off. I can't see.
[41:52.870 --> 41:54.010]  You'll have to tell me when I go.
[41:54.390 --> 41:54.770]  Okay.
[41:57.690 --> 41:59.390]  Nick picks dinner!
[42:00.250 --> 42:00.970]  Nick, you pick dinner.
[42:03.610 --> 42:04.010]  Okay.
[42:06.110 --> 42:07.390]  I'll tell you what's for dinner.
[42:08.130 --> 42:08.930]  We're gonna...
[42:08.930 --> 42:10.250]  We're gonna have some fajitas.
[42:11.570 --> 42:12.950]  Okay, fajitas for dinner.
[42:13.070 --> 42:14.330]  I'm gonna let Emily know. Hold on.
[42:17.410 --> 42:17.890]  Uh...
[42:17.890 --> 42:19.510]  Fajitas for dinner.
[42:20.510 --> 42:21.210]  I'm gonna text Meg.
[42:21.650 --> 42:23.050]  Text my wife.
[42:23.530 --> 42:24.230]  Text my wife.
[42:25.690 --> 42:28.370]  We have to have fajitas for dinner.
[42:29.790 --> 42:31.270]  I've just simply texted her
[42:31.270 --> 42:32.250]  fajitas for dinner.
[42:32.490 --> 42:33.170]  No explanation.
[42:34.650 --> 42:36.730]  I think it's funny that Nick phrased
[42:36.730 --> 42:38.390]  that we have to when he picked.
[42:38.610 --> 42:39.570]  It was his choice.
[42:40.630 --> 42:42.710]  Well, if I say it's from the rest of us
[42:42.710 --> 42:43.630]  then she doesn't know it's me.
[42:43.830 --> 42:46.090]  Now, I just realized I have to remove
[42:46.090 --> 42:47.610]  you pick dinner. Dinner's been picked.
[42:47.930 --> 42:50.730]  Oh, shit. Pick breakfast tomorrow.
[42:50.890 --> 42:52.290]  Third wheel becomes even more dangerous.
[42:52.810 --> 42:54.430]  Are you ready? Yes.
[42:54.670 --> 42:56.230]  Spin this first wheel. Please spin.
[43:01.080 --> 43:01.480]  Oh!
[43:03.060 --> 43:04.360]  It's back to Nick!
[43:04.680 --> 43:07.300]  Nick, do you want to make a pick or do you want to spin the second wheel?
[43:07.500 --> 43:08.500]  Spin the second wheel!
[43:08.640 --> 43:09.940]  Spin the second wheel!
[43:10.680 --> 43:12.220]  I just want to steal something.
[43:15.660 --> 43:16.700]  Spin again!
[43:20.260 --> 43:21.500]  Spin that wheel.
[43:24.520 --> 43:27.400]  Have you guys been watching Ryan Seacrest?
[43:28.380 --> 43:28.540]  No!
[43:29.300 --> 43:32.120]  Alright, so...
[43:32.120 --> 43:33.220]  Nick
[43:33.620 --> 43:35.820]  loses this turn and his
[43:35.820 --> 43:36.700]  next turn.
[43:37.480 --> 43:39.600]  So, do I even put him back on the
[43:39.600 --> 43:40.980]  first wheel for this one?
[43:41.560 --> 43:43.220]  Nah. Here we go.
[43:47.850 --> 43:48.430]  Go on!
[43:49.870 --> 43:51.350]  Oh! Eric!
[43:54.850 --> 43:56.350]  Spinning that second wheel!
[44:01.890 --> 44:03.110]  It's a skip!
[44:04.210 --> 44:05.370]  Alright, Eric and Nick
[44:05.370 --> 44:06.330]  come back in.
[44:09.950 --> 44:12.630]  I feel like we're going to be at four forever.
[44:13.570 --> 44:14.150]  Gavin!
[44:14.770 --> 44:15.310]  Gavin!
[44:17.630 --> 44:18.470]  Going for the
[44:18.470 --> 44:20.450]  pool or are you going for the second
[44:20.450 --> 44:20.850]  wheel?
[44:22.490 --> 44:23.950]  How many am I missing? One?
[44:24.330 --> 44:25.170]  Just one? Yeah.
[44:27.370 --> 44:28.450]  Greg Joseph.
[44:29.350 --> 44:30.150]  Greg Joseph?
[44:30.250 --> 44:30.850]  What team is he on?
[44:32.530 --> 44:33.070]  Giants.
[44:34.350 --> 44:34.650]  Oof.
[44:36.230 --> 44:36.970]  Greg Joseph.
[44:38.430 --> 44:40.190]  Gavin is locked in. Greg Joseph.
[44:40.490 --> 44:42.450]  The Giants are just a bad
[44:42.450 --> 44:43.730]  team. Oh.
[44:44.450 --> 44:46.730]  Which may lead to more kicks. Should've done the second wheel.
[44:47.470 --> 44:48.710]  Yeah, you definitely should've done
[44:48.710 --> 44:50.350]  the second wheel but now it's just
[44:50.850 --> 44:52.250]  me and Nick!
[44:53.370 --> 44:54.470]  And there were two.
[44:55.730 --> 44:56.810]  Well, three with Eric's
[44:56.810 --> 44:57.810]  two. Shit.
[44:58.250 --> 45:00.470]  Oh! Hang on.
[45:00.630 --> 45:01.810]  Okay, let me have a look.
[45:02.330 --> 45:03.290]  Let me see who we got.
[45:05.170 --> 45:06.590]  See if there's anyone on here
[45:06.590 --> 45:07.310]  that I want.
[45:09.670 --> 45:10.110]  Hmm.
[45:11.850 --> 45:12.330]  Somebody...
[45:12.330 --> 45:14.270]  Who got Austin Seabrook? That was Geoff?
[45:14.510 --> 45:16.050]  No, that's Nick. That was me.
[45:16.230 --> 45:16.470]  Nick.
[45:18.790 --> 45:20.270]  Oh, and then who got
[45:20.270 --> 45:21.770]  Joey Slot? That was you, Geoff?
[45:22.070 --> 45:24.090]  That was Gavin or Nick?
[45:24.290 --> 45:25.290]  That was Nick. Wow.
[45:25.670 --> 45:27.490]  I got Dustin Hopkins.
[45:27.810 --> 45:28.030]  Okay.
[45:30.190 --> 45:32.850]  Hmm. I think...
[45:34.870 --> 45:36.390]  I think I'm gonna go with
[45:36.390 --> 45:38.310]  Brandon McManus just in the interest of
[45:38.310 --> 45:40.470]  moving something along here. Well, Brandon McManus
[45:40.470 --> 45:42.410]  is a great kicker. It's a good pick.
[45:42.770 --> 45:44.130]  He kicks a good ball.
[45:44.830 --> 45:46.390]  He does. He does. But I'm also
[45:46.390 --> 45:48.250]  not done because
[45:48.250 --> 45:50.410]  there is one more
[45:50.410 --> 45:52.370]  Eric. Could you quickly add something to the
[45:52.370 --> 45:54.390]  third wheel? Yeah, what would you
[45:54.390 --> 45:56.470]  like? Go to fourth wheel. I'm
[45:56.470 --> 45:58.430]  so glad you put that
[45:58.430 --> 45:59.590]  in there. I was gonna...
[46:00.210 --> 46:01.750]  I was lamenting that we didn't do that.
[46:02.110 --> 46:04.330]  There it is. Let me shuffle this a bunch
[46:04.330 --> 46:06.130]  of times. There you go.
[46:06.770 --> 46:08.430]  Here we go. Me and Nick. Spin the wheel.
[46:09.110 --> 46:10.150]  50-50, Nick.
[46:10.390 --> 46:10.870]  How you feeling?
[46:15.590 --> 46:16.230]  That's good.
[46:16.290 --> 46:17.390]  You don't have to make any decisions.
[46:17.590 --> 46:18.990]  You don't have to make any decisions.
[46:19.710 --> 46:21.210]  Because I'm going to the second wheel!
[46:21.730 --> 46:23.990]  Oh, what you gonna get on the
[46:23.990 --> 46:25.710]  second wheel of madness?
[46:27.630 --> 46:28.930]  It's lining up
[46:29.770 --> 46:30.650]  for Skip.
[46:31.490 --> 46:31.830]  Again.
[46:33.090 --> 46:34.390]  Spin the first fucking wheel.
[46:34.390 --> 46:35.550]  Spin it again.
[46:38.850 --> 46:39.290]  No!
[46:40.450 --> 46:42.030]  Eric is on a roll.
[46:42.490 --> 46:44.470]  Well, now you know what I gotta do, guys.
[46:44.750 --> 46:46.190]  Remove my name and go back
[46:46.190 --> 46:47.530]  to the second wheel.
[46:54.090 --> 46:55.830]  Return to the first wheel!
[46:57.270 --> 46:58.270]  Put your name back on that
[46:58.270 --> 46:59.070]  first wheel, Eric.
[47:01.950 --> 47:03.250]  Let's spin the wheel!
[47:06.410 --> 47:07.510]  Come on, man!
[47:07.910 --> 47:10.490]  Eric, what are you gonna do
[47:10.490 --> 47:11.150]  with winning this?
[47:11.390 --> 47:14.050]  I gotta remove. There we go.
[47:14.170 --> 47:15.650]  Now let's get back to the second wheel.
[47:15.890 --> 47:17.290]  It's the second wheel!
[47:17.450 --> 47:18.470]  Who could have seen this?
[47:19.670 --> 47:21.150]  Maybe keep your name on there
[47:21.150 --> 47:22.210]  until the next time.
[47:24.010 --> 47:25.430]  And it's Skip!
[47:25.490 --> 47:27.550]  We're going back to the first wheel.
[47:27.550 --> 47:28.810]  I gotta shuffle these.
[47:29.550 --> 47:30.030]  What?
[47:33.130 --> 47:34.370]  Now, Eric, spin the wheel!
[47:37.790 --> 47:38.730]  Oh, it might be Nick!
[47:39.310 --> 47:40.010]  It might be Nick!
[47:40.890 --> 47:43.950]  Can you believe that? Eric wins the wheel again!
[47:44.090 --> 47:45.550]  Eric, what are you gonna do with your wheel?
[47:45.550 --> 47:47.410]  Remove my name. Oh, that's Andrew.
[47:47.490 --> 47:48.490]  You know I gotta go to the second wheel.
[47:48.630 --> 47:50.130]  Oh, he's spinning the second wheel!
[47:53.270 --> 47:54.130]  Oh no!
[47:54.130 --> 47:55.450]  Oh no!
[47:56.330 --> 47:56.750]  Skip!
[47:57.610 --> 48:00.130]  He's almost going to the third wheel, but it is a Skip!
[48:00.270 --> 48:01.550]  So back to the first wheel.
[48:03.890 --> 48:05.090]  Eric, spin the wheel!
[48:07.110 --> 48:09.570]  It might be Nick! It's Nick!
[48:09.810 --> 48:11.930]  Nick won the wheel! Nick, what are you gonna do?
[48:11.950 --> 48:13.310]  Yeah! Spin the wheel!
[48:17.350 --> 48:18.590]  Spin the second wheel!
[48:24.170 --> 48:26.010]  Oh no! Nick gets a block!
[48:26.630 --> 48:27.470]  Who are you? Alright.
[48:28.190 --> 48:29.550]  Who are you blocking?
[48:29.630 --> 48:31.310]  Who can not be taken from your team?
[48:31.530 --> 48:35.110]  Is that how it works, or does he just have a blocked card that he can play if someone tries to steal it?
[48:35.110 --> 48:35.690]  Oh, okay. That's good.
[48:36.210 --> 48:38.690]  Block it anytime. So let me add Nick back onto this wheel.
[48:39.170 --> 48:40.570]  Alright, let's spin the first wheel!
[48:41.150 --> 48:42.790]  I forgot he'd be back.
[48:46.350 --> 48:46.790]  Okay.
[48:47.850 --> 48:48.870]  Eric, he's removed!
[48:49.590 --> 48:50.610]  Don't remove it!
[48:50.610 --> 48:51.270]  Just leave!
[48:52.250 --> 48:54.550]  And let's spin that second wheel!
[48:55.210 --> 48:58.130]  What's he gonna get on the wheel of madness?
[49:00.470 --> 49:01.410]  The other half!
[49:02.110 --> 49:05.210]  He won the same half of the same car!
[49:05.850 --> 49:09.650]  Eric has two halves of the same car, but the same broken half.
[49:09.730 --> 49:10.870]  He's got two left shoes.
[49:13.070 --> 49:14.990]  I'm spinning the first wheel!
[49:16.070 --> 49:17.410]  How is your car split?
[49:17.590 --> 49:19.190]  Is it front, back, or left, right?
[49:19.190 --> 49:20.390]  Oh, it's left, right.
[49:20.590 --> 49:20.770]  Or top, bottom.
[49:20.990 --> 49:23.950]  I would want to have the bottom half of my car.
[49:24.270 --> 49:25.470]  Oh my god. Nick!
[49:25.890 --> 49:27.210]  Do you want to go to the second wheel?
[49:27.450 --> 49:28.270]  Yeah, spin it.
[49:28.490 --> 49:29.570]  Spin the second wheel!
[49:38.080 --> 49:38.440]  Okay!
[49:38.840 --> 49:41.000]  You lost your turn, so just skip on this one.
[49:41.820 --> 49:44.420]  So just spin this wheel again, because it's gonna be you, and you're gonna want the second wheel.
[49:44.420 --> 49:46.000]  Just spin it for you, because that's what you want.
[49:46.060 --> 49:48.220]  Why? What makes you think I want to take the second wheel?
[49:48.260 --> 49:49.340]  Hey, you know what? That's a good point.
[49:49.340 --> 49:52.060]  Why wouldn't I want to take a kicker here?
[49:52.800 --> 49:53.840]  That's a great point, Eric.
[49:53.960 --> 49:56.400]  Maybe you should spin the first wheel again, with just your name on it.
[49:56.680 --> 49:58.420]  But if Eric spins now,
[49:58.520 --> 49:59.980]  and Nick misses his next turn,
[50:00.220 --> 50:01.060]  no one will go.
[50:04.410 --> 50:04.790]  What?
[50:05.970 --> 50:06.990]  No, you don't understand.
[50:08.390 --> 50:09.490]  If Eric picks now,
[50:09.550 --> 50:10.550]  his name will be off the wheel,
[50:10.610 --> 50:12.870]  and only Nick will be on the wheel.
[50:13.330 --> 50:16.830]  No, so this is the spin that Nick is removed from.
[50:17.150 --> 50:17.870]  So it'll be Eric,
[50:18.390 --> 50:19.770]  and then once Eric makes his pick,
[50:19.770 --> 50:20.830]  then Nick is back on.
[50:21.150 --> 50:22.150]  Oh, he's already back on.
[50:23.770 --> 50:25.570]  I just didn't want no one to be on the wheel.
[50:25.610 --> 50:27.250]  No, no, no. Don't worry about that.
[50:27.370 --> 50:28.130]  Nick will be on that wheel.
[50:31.210 --> 50:31.910]  Eric, spin the wheel!
[50:35.880 --> 50:37.040]  Oh, it landed on Eric.
[50:37.180 --> 50:38.040]  Eric, what are you gonna do?
[50:38.560 --> 50:40.040]  Hang on, hang on.
[50:40.760 --> 50:41.600]  I'm gonna remove myself.
[50:43.680 --> 50:44.880]  He's spinning the second wheel.
[50:46.800 --> 50:48.760]  I'd love to know how many wheel spins we've had.
[50:49.780 --> 50:50.180]  Oh...
[50:50.760 --> 50:50.960]  Oh!
[50:52.360 --> 50:55.020]  Okay, that skips, so now it's just Nick on the wheel.
[50:55.180 --> 50:56.740]  No, it's both of us.
[50:57.960 --> 51:00.460]  If you get to go again...
[51:01.480 --> 51:02.220]  Oh, Nick, it's up to you, buddy.
[51:02.220 --> 51:04.060]  I'm shocked that neither of you are pulling for the pool.
[51:04.140 --> 51:05.340]  I think there's some good kickers there.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.880]  Yeah, I think so. But you know what?
[51:08.080 --> 51:10.200]  In the interest of time, let's spin the wheel.
[51:11.360 --> 51:11.760]  Yeah.
[51:15.140 --> 51:16.620]  I wonder when this goes.
[51:16.620 --> 51:16.980]  Oh!
[51:18.600 --> 51:19.640]  Oh, it's a steal!
[51:21.920 --> 51:23.980]  Okay, who am I stealing?
[51:27.080 --> 51:29.020]  Nick, I give you permission to steal from me.
[51:29.400 --> 51:29.900]  If you'd like to.
[51:31.020 --> 51:32.740]  Oh, that's very sweet of you.
[51:34.420 --> 51:36.480]  Will Lutz from Andrew.
[51:37.320 --> 51:37.700]  Denver.
[51:39.560 --> 51:41.220]  Denver, Will Lutz, got it.
[51:41.240 --> 51:43.060]  Putting a curse on that man as soon as we're done.
[51:45.240 --> 51:45.680]  Wait.
[51:47.640 --> 51:48.060]  Am I?
[51:48.440 --> 51:48.960]  Oh, Broncos.
[51:49.240 --> 51:51.940]  Sorry, I got all mixed up.
[51:52.720 --> 51:53.640]  Put me back on that wheel.
[51:53.920 --> 51:55.820]  Alright, Andrew's back on that wheel.
[51:56.380 --> 51:57.500]  Me and Andrew on the wheel!
[52:04.980 --> 52:05.420]  And...
[52:06.800 --> 52:07.240]  it's...
[52:07.240 --> 52:09.880]  me. Okay, I'll remove myself, spin that second wheel.
[52:10.260 --> 52:12.900]  Do you remember when this was just going to be a simple redraft?
[52:15.000 --> 52:15.520]  No!
[52:16.800 --> 52:17.320]  No!
[52:18.240 --> 52:19.040]  Go to third wheel!
[52:19.040 --> 52:20.620]  We're going to the third wheel!
[52:21.000 --> 52:21.940]  No, Eric!
[52:22.660 --> 52:23.880]  Oh god, Eric!
[52:24.540 --> 52:26.020]  You gotta add tomorrow's breakfast.
[52:26.800 --> 52:28.500]  Oh yeah, pick tomorrow's lunch.
[52:28.820 --> 52:29.560]  Pick tomorrow's lunch.
[52:31.860 --> 52:33.040]  Oh my god.
[52:34.280 --> 52:35.220]  Here we go!
[52:35.360 --> 52:37.720]  No, anything but full team drop.
[52:37.840 --> 52:38.880]  Anything but full team drop.
[52:39.420 --> 52:40.260]  No full team drop.
[52:40.260 --> 52:41.580]  We're past it, we're past it.
[52:42.260 --> 52:44.460]  Go back to second wheel.
[52:47.940 --> 52:49.960]  Get me out of this hell!
[52:50.540 --> 52:52.220]  You created this hell!
[52:52.320 --> 52:53.920]  Yeah, I'm ready to leave now, though.
[52:56.460 --> 52:58.400]  You can't leave your hell!
[52:58.540 --> 53:00.480]  You're the architect of hell!
[53:00.700 --> 53:03.040]  To be fair, we all put hands on this hell.
[53:03.160 --> 53:04.580]  I had a different hell planned.
[53:04.940 --> 53:06.180]  And, uh...
[53:06.180 --> 53:06.720]  We all built this.
[53:06.720 --> 53:07.860]  You're Ted Danson.
[53:09.720 --> 53:10.240]  Alright!
[53:10.640 --> 53:12.140]  Let's see who it lands on!
[53:12.700 --> 53:13.040]  Eric.
[53:14.180 --> 53:16.740]  Can he stop winning this fucking wheel?
[53:16.740 --> 53:17.600]  Go to the second wheel!
[53:22.130 --> 53:22.650]  Skip.
[53:23.390 --> 53:25.770]  Jesus Christ, just let me win one!
[53:27.110 --> 53:27.930]  Alright, close.
[53:28.170 --> 53:28.790]  Head on back.
[53:29.450 --> 53:30.770]  Get back on this wheel here.
[53:30.990 --> 53:32.150]  And let's spin the first wheel!
[53:32.910 --> 53:34.530]  How long has this recording been going?
[53:34.530 --> 53:35.650]  Oh, too long.
[53:38.390 --> 53:40.490]  And it is...
[53:40.490 --> 53:41.470]  Eric!
[53:42.010 --> 53:43.290]  Oh, you know I gotta go to that second wheel.
[53:45.190 --> 53:46.870]  I blame you, Andrew.
[53:47.450 --> 53:48.070]  For all of this.
[53:48.370 --> 53:49.450]  You blame me?
[53:49.490 --> 53:51.770]  You're the one that filled the wheel!
[53:52.190 --> 53:53.670]  You're the one who brought the wheels!
[53:53.990 --> 53:57.010]  Yeah, but I wanted to put a cap on how many spins you could do.
[53:57.770 --> 53:58.710]  Well, you didn't.
[53:59.690 --> 54:03.190]  And it is...
[54:03.190 --> 54:03.590]  Andrew.
[54:04.030 --> 54:04.750]  Hang on.
[54:06.390 --> 54:06.830]  Andrew!
[54:08.590 --> 54:10.270]  Oh, you're gonna take from the pool?
[54:10.570 --> 54:11.610]  Yeah, I wanna take from the pool.
[54:12.230 --> 54:15.990]  No, I think there's some good options in the pool.
[54:16.170 --> 54:16.550]  Let me...
[54:16.550 --> 54:16.930]  Great!
[54:17.330 --> 54:17.790]  Let's see.
[54:17.890 --> 54:22.390]  Who wound up with Brandon Aubrey?
[54:23.850 --> 54:24.290]  Gavin.
[54:25.090 --> 54:27.550]  I'm gonna take Jason Sanders from the Dolphins.
[54:28.050 --> 54:28.870]  Oh, shit.
[54:29.590 --> 54:31.330]  Now that Tua's back, I feel a little bit better about the chances.
[54:31.330 --> 54:33.010]  Yeah, I think Tua, with Tua returning,
[54:33.250 --> 54:34.690]  I think they could get their offense going.
[54:35.310 --> 54:38.190]  I'm hoping for a second half of the season return.
[54:38.430 --> 54:39.870]  For what the Dolphins could be.
[54:40.630 --> 54:41.350]  Yeah, so are they.
[54:41.670 --> 54:41.890]  Yep.
[54:42.610 --> 54:44.830]  Alright, and now we get back here.
[54:45.450 --> 54:46.010]  It's Eric.
[54:47.930 --> 54:48.710]  Here's Edric.
[54:49.070 --> 54:51.130]  The gothic horror, Edric.
[54:52.810 --> 54:54.150]  I only need one more.
[54:57.710 --> 54:58.610]  Okay, let me get it off there.
[54:59.390 --> 55:00.990]  Now, I think...
[55:01.930 --> 55:03.050]  Let me see.
[55:03.610 --> 55:05.210]  I think I'm gonna go to the second wheel.
[55:06.430 --> 55:08.810]  You son of a bitch.
[55:12.570 --> 55:13.710]  Just spin it again.
[55:13.950 --> 55:15.050]  Just spin this wheel again.
[55:15.150 --> 55:15.630]  Are you sure?
[55:16.010 --> 55:18.490]  I can put my name back on here, though.
[55:18.690 --> 55:19.570]  Are you sure?
[55:20.530 --> 55:22.810]  No, you gotta spin the first one.
[55:24.930 --> 55:26.590]  Goddamnit, Gavin, you ain't correct.
[55:27.090 --> 55:28.030]  We gotta do it right.
[55:28.290 --> 55:29.890]  We're nothing if not regulation.
[55:29.890 --> 55:30.970]  That's true.
[55:31.050 --> 55:32.230]  Let's not half-ass this.
[55:32.730 --> 55:33.790]  Too far in.
[55:34.890 --> 55:36.650]  I'd like to apologize to everybody.
[55:36.830 --> 55:36.990]  Sorry.
[55:38.350 --> 55:39.730]  I'm gonna spin that second wheel.
[55:40.490 --> 55:42.450]  Now, what are you trying to get on this second wheel?
[55:42.930 --> 55:45.410]  I'm thinking about a steel.
[55:46.230 --> 55:46.810]  Force drop.
[55:48.930 --> 55:51.490]  You have to go two fucking times.
[55:52.050 --> 55:53.310]  Hang on.
[55:55.210 --> 55:56.430]  You're a nightmare!
[55:59.620 --> 56:01.200]  We can upload audio here
[56:01.200 --> 56:01.780]  when we're done.
[56:02.360 --> 56:04.140]  We're not even close to done, buddy.
[56:04.200 --> 56:05.340]  I know, I'm just putting it here.
[56:06.860 --> 56:09.080]  I think I'm gonna spin that first wheel.
[56:09.420 --> 56:12.020]  How long was the first Hector Picker?
[56:12.080 --> 56:13.540]  It had to have been half this.
[56:14.120 --> 56:14.600]  Hang on.
[56:15.860 --> 56:17.220]  Oh, my God.
[56:17.680 --> 56:18.820]  You might get him back.
[56:19.180 --> 56:19.800]  Oh, you did.
[56:20.160 --> 56:20.660]  That's good.
[56:21.280 --> 56:23.100]  I'm gonna go ahead and make it over here.
[56:24.760 --> 56:28.260]  I never thought I would spin this first wheel.
[56:28.260 --> 56:31.220]  I see the day that Eric out-Andrewed Andrew.
[56:31.420 --> 56:32.520]  But this is awesome.
[56:33.680 --> 56:34.520]  I'm gonna spin that first wheel.
[56:34.820 --> 56:36.580]  Imagine if he gets the full team drop.
[56:36.720 --> 56:38.540]  I know, I've been thinking about it.
[56:38.620 --> 56:39.920]  Six Erics.
[56:40.060 --> 56:41.220]  I will walk out of this recording
[56:41.220 --> 56:42.980]  if Eric gets the full team drop.
[56:43.680 --> 56:45.580]  The first one was 35 minutes.
[56:45.800 --> 56:47.060]  This was Andrew, right? Okay.
[56:48.680 --> 56:50.480]  Greg Zurline's still available, right?
[56:50.920 --> 56:51.840]  But he's on thin ice.
[56:52.040 --> 56:53.580]  It feels like he's...
[56:53.580 --> 56:55.920]  You know what? I gotta spin that second wheel.
[56:55.920 --> 56:56.220]  Oh, shit.
[56:59.800 --> 57:01.220]  Oh, my God.
[57:01.400 --> 57:02.300]  Oh, my God.
[57:02.900 --> 57:03.540]  No!
[57:04.760 --> 57:06.680]  Don't go to the third wheel!
[57:07.520 --> 57:08.660]  Oh, God.
[57:08.960 --> 57:09.800]  Are you ready?
[57:11.860 --> 57:12.500]  No!
[57:15.200 --> 57:15.840]  Oh!
[57:16.380 --> 57:18.460]  Go back to the second wheel.
[57:18.460 --> 57:19.420]  Go back to the second wheel.
[57:21.640 --> 57:22.720]  Every time...
[57:22.720 --> 57:24.240]  That third wheel is so scary.
[57:24.940 --> 57:26.160]  Go to the second.
[57:27.300 --> 57:29.060]  Gavin made the third wheel scary
[57:29.060 --> 57:30.200]  with the full team drop.
[57:30.440 --> 57:31.660]  I gotta lose a turn.
[57:32.080 --> 57:34.100]  It doesn't matter. Just spin.
[57:34.240 --> 57:34.440]  Alright.
[57:35.540 --> 57:37.480]  Take yourself off the first wheel.
[57:40.600 --> 57:41.900]  Put no one.
[57:47.210 --> 57:48.610]  Spinning a blank wheel.
[57:50.050 --> 57:50.510]  Okay.
[57:50.790 --> 57:52.510]  He doesn't need to spin a one wheel.
[57:52.510 --> 57:54.750]  So now you can put your tape back on.
[57:55.090 --> 57:55.830]  It's good.
[57:57.390 --> 57:58.910]  I'm gonna shit myself.
[58:00.030 --> 58:02.610]  I can't believe we have to record again today.
[58:03.610 --> 58:04.790]  I'm so tired.
[58:04.990 --> 58:06.710]  Do something live today.
[58:06.950 --> 58:08.410]  We have to eat fajitas.
[58:09.670 --> 58:12.590]  I have to go to Texas Roadhouse
[58:12.590 --> 58:13.790]  to do it too, I think.
[58:15.270 --> 58:15.690]  Alright.
[58:16.610 --> 58:17.170]  Oh, shit.
[58:17.750 --> 58:19.270]  He gets the steal.
[58:22.510 --> 58:23.950]  I'm gonna steal. Who do I want?
[58:24.370 --> 58:25.710]  I'm thinking...
[58:25.710 --> 58:28.830]  I'm thinking I'm gonna take the Cowboys
[58:28.830 --> 58:29.630]  Brandon Aubrey.
[58:31.990 --> 58:33.830]  Now he's back on my team.
[58:34.930 --> 58:36.250]  There we go. We're good.
[58:36.370 --> 58:38.010]  And now, we're back here.
[58:39.250 --> 58:40.290]  Gavin's on the board.
[58:40.530 --> 58:41.510]  Gavin, you ready to spin that wheel?
[58:42.630 --> 58:43.790]  Alright, spinning that wheel.
[58:44.230 --> 58:44.830]  3, 2, 1, go.
[58:49.390 --> 58:50.110]  Hang on.
[58:50.790 --> 58:51.790]  No, yeah, you're right.
[58:52.230 --> 58:53.430]  I want to jump the gun.
[58:53.650 --> 58:55.270]  Oh, there we go. He won now.
[58:55.290 --> 58:56.550]  Pop over to the second wheel.
[58:56.590 --> 58:58.970]  Oh, the second wheel.
[58:59.230 --> 58:59.990]  Alright, here we go.
[59:00.810 --> 59:02.650]  I'm determined to get to that fourth wheel.
[59:07.950 --> 59:10.910]  Okay, that's good. Hang on.
[59:13.990 --> 59:14.870]  Not available.
[59:15.250 --> 59:17.170]  A not available wheel spin.
[59:18.430 --> 59:19.230]  Not applicable.
[59:22.190 --> 59:23.550]  Whatever, they both start with A.
[59:23.770 --> 59:25.050]  Move. Alright, Gavin,
[59:25.290 --> 59:27.630]  getting back on the first wheel.
[59:29.190 --> 59:31.290]  Andrew, remember when you messaged me earlier and you asked about
[59:31.290 --> 59:33.230]  if a stealing mechanic would work for this?
[59:33.390 --> 59:34.850]  And I said, I think if we do this again,
[59:35.190 --> 59:37.270]  maybe it would work, but maybe not for this one.
[59:37.390 --> 59:37.970]  Oh, you knew about this?
[59:38.150 --> 59:39.810]  I didn't know about what this was gonna be.
[59:40.270 --> 59:41.470]  Oh, so you're part of the problem?
[59:42.010 --> 59:45.550]  At what point do you think this became torture for the audience?
[59:46.090 --> 59:46.950]  30 minutes ago.
[59:47.010 --> 59:48.390]  Yeah, probably 20 minutes in.
[59:49.010 --> 59:51.310]  Gavin, do you wanna just make your pick,
[59:51.350 --> 59:52.410]  or do you wanna spin the second wheel?
[59:52.590 --> 59:54.630]  I'll spin. Oh, let's spin that second wheel.
[59:56.010 --> 59:57.530]  Can't wait to see what we're gonna have for breakfast.
[59:58.590 --> 59:59.290]  Oh my God.
[59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.370]  Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:01.990]  Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.
[01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:05.670]  Skip. Okay. Yep. That's tough.
[01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:07.350]  So, you're back here.
[01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:08.730]  Let's spin the first wheel.
[01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:10.410]  Oh.
[01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:14.430]  People, we should
[01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:16.430]  award a badge.
[01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:19.070]  Or like, some sort of a patch
[01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:20.590]  that we mail out to people that have
[01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.290]  100% watch time in this video.
[01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.630]  Gavin, would you like to make a pick?
[01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:26.710]  I'll spin the wheel. Oh, you'll spin the wheel. Okay.
[01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:28.030]  Spin that wheel.
[01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:30.970]  Also, the Chained Together logo on this thing the whole time
[01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:31.690]  has been really great.
[01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:33.250]  Oh!
[01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.290]  It's a steal! It's a steal!
[01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:37.910]  I have a feeling I know!
[01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.590]  Gavin, Gavin, what are you thinking?
[01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.010]  Gavin, you're welcome to steal from me if you want.
[01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:44.290]  Um...
[01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:46.170]  I mean, Brandon Aubrey's always looking good.
[01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.710]  Uh-huh.
[01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:50.290]  I just, I didn't even have to paste it.
[01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.670]  I just hit undo. Alright!
[01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.110]  Back to the first wheel!
[01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:55.770]  Oh!
[01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:59.870]  The sound effect died. Wait, it's never gonna end.
[01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:02.210]  What if Eric just
[01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.630]  picks?
[01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:04.970]  He's not gonna
[01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:06.050]  He's not gonna
[01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.170]  Get on over to that second wheel!
[01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.490]  God almighty.
[01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:12.770]  It's, this is gonna have to end when we
[01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.630]  have to do the sloppy
[01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.310]  Oh my god, it's a steal?
[01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:18.590]  Oh god, dude.
[01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.590]  Well hang on, let me see what my choices are.
[01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:22.450]  Alright, I'm gonna take Cowboy's Brandon Aubrey.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:24.110]  Did you just hit redo?
[01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.490]  Yeah. Gavin, you ready?
[01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:28.550]  Hey Andrew, Andrew, do you know what
[01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:30.470]  the shortcut is for redo?
[01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:31.770]  No.
[01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:34.630]  Okay. I don't know any shortcuts.
[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.670]  We'll cover that in Tuesday.
[01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:38.890]  Gavin, you've been selected.
[01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:40.670]  I learned that recently.
[01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:41.990]  Okay, let's get to the second wheel.
[01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:44.750]  I hate you guys so much.
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.090]  So, what's undo?
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:48.850]  Let's go ahead
[01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:49.350]  and lose a turn.
[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.870]  That's what Gavin wanted to do in this scenario.
[01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:53.050]  Okay.
[01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:55.810]  There's nothing.
[01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:58.730]  How many wheel spins
[01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:00.030]  have we had? I must know.
[01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.530]  We're over 100.
[01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.910]  46?
[01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:06.170]  On this wheel?
[01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.810]  Yeah.
[01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.550]  We gotta add the wheel totals.
[01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:13.030]  Add the wheel totals.
[01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.410]  Just pick from the pool.
[01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.850]  There's plenty of good
[01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:17.850]  kickers in the pool.
[01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.170]  I feel like you get a better deal on the
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:21.250]  second wheel.
[01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.830]  You take it in the second wheels where you want to go?
[01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:25.210]  Okay.
[01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:27.250]  Really, we're off to the third wheel, aren't we?
[01:02:29.090 --> 01:02:30.690]  I'm certainly not.
[01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.750]  It's tough.
[01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:38.750]  Gavin, tough luck. Let's go back to the first wheel.
[01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.110]  I don't want to keep going.
[01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:46.690]  I don't want to be the one to end it.
[01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:47.350]  I gotta stand up.
[01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:51.550]  I ran out of water so long ago.
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:52.270]  Got your choice.
[01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.330]  We got all the kickers in the field.
[01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.630]  You want the second wheel? You got it, buddy.
[01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:06.530]  It's a steal!
[01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:07.910]  Wow, what a steal.
[01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:09.570]  Gavin, you're welcome to steal from me.
[01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.110]  I'm going to steal...
[01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:16.710]  Kamey
[01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:17.690]  Fairbairn.
[01:03:17.850 --> 01:03:20.370]  You fucking asshole.
[01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.370]  You suck.
[01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:37.610]  I'm going to the second wheel.
[01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:39.890]  Actually might shit.
[01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:41.950]  I'm going to piss my pants.
[01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:44.290]  Put the mic close to your butt.
[01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:49.350]  Now, here's what I'm thinking.
[01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.270]  If I can have my choice of anyone on this list,
[01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:54.430]  it's got to be Houston Texans
[01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.410]  kicker Kamey Fairbairn.
[01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.290]  So, there you go.
[01:03:57.330 --> 01:03:59.210]  Gavin, get you back on that first wheel.
[01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.650]  I think, Andrew,
[01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:04.390]  next year, when we do
[01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:05.670]  the kicker re-kicker,
[01:04:06.350 --> 01:04:07.630]  no steal backsies.
[01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.290]  Yeah, I think maybe this isn't
[01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.970]  the format for next time, but what do I know?
[01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.150]  Hey, Gavin, second wheel or you want to make your pick?
[01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.210]  I think this might be
[01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:19.070]  the format for everything going forward now.
[01:04:19.330 --> 01:04:20.410]  The fucking nested
[01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:21.230]  wheel structure?
[01:04:22.330 --> 01:04:23.930]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:24.970]  You know what to do.
[01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:27.650]  It's a steal. Alright, Gavin, who do you think?
[01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:28.530]  Anyone on this board?
[01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:30.410]  Just say undo.
[01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:32.970]  You got it. Oh, that's Brandon Aubrey, sorry.
[01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.270]  We're taking
[01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.930]  too many steps backward. I apologize.
[01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.070]  It's just Gavin and Eric
[01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:43.470]  jerking each other off.
[01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:45.810]  I'm jerking myself off. Wait, what?
[01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:48.770]  Hang on, am I laying on this line?
[01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:49.710]  Oh, that was close.
[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.410]  What's going on?
[01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.370]  Get my name off of there and give it a big spin.
[01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:56.790]  It's you two stealing the same dick to jerk
[01:04:56.790 --> 01:04:57.050]  with.
[01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:59.490]  Mine, no mine.
[01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:03.070]  Spin again!
[01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:06.050]  That was almost force drop.
[01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.730]  I wonder what the odds are of getting to the
[01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:10.810]  fourth wheel. Insane, so stop
[01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:11.290]  trying.
[01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:13.470]  Please land.
[01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:15.190]  Oh, it's landed.
[01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:17.590]  It's landed on steel.
[01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:19.810]  I'm thinking I want
[01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:21.910]  oh boy, Houston Texans kicker
[01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:23.730]  Keami Fairburn. So, Gavin,
[01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.050]  that means you're going, you're the only
[01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:28.030]  one left in this whole thing. So let's
[01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:29.970]  see where this lands. Our five
[01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:32.090]  minutes in. Yeah, I mean like
[01:05:32.090 --> 01:05:33.190]  could be...
[01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.610]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:37.510]  Gavin, all right, Gavin.
[01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:38.910]  I will pick Greg
[01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:41.350]  Zuillein. Oh my god!
[01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:41.450]  What?
[01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:44.770]  I think he's a good player.
[01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.530]  I think he could win it for me.
[01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.030]  Holy shit.
[01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:50.770]  It is over.
[01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.250]  The kicker, picker, re-picker is
[01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:54.870]  in the books. Yep.
[01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.170]  How's everyone feeling about their new teams?
[01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.050]  I think we should do a recap
[01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.350]  because I haven't... because that was like an hour
[01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:02.630]  ago and who can remember?
[01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.710]  Let's see. Nick,
[01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.190]  you picked up Joey
[01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:09.330]  Sly, Austin Sebertson,
[01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:11.210]  and Will Lux. Damn Nick, that's a
[01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.110]  real... you really improved your team.
[01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:15.110]  I picked up Brandon
[01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.290]  McManus, Geoff,
[01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:19.430]  you picked up Dustin Hopkins,
[01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:21.110]  Andrew
[01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:21.810]  Pinker.
[01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:25.730]  Hanson
[01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:26.430]  Pucker.
[01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:28.950]  I don't even...
[01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:31.190]  He chose him. Oh I did?
[01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:32.810]  I don't even remember doing that.
[01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:35.170]  You stole him off my
[01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.870]  damn team. I forgot about it.
[01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:39.110]  Yeah, I did that, didn't I?
[01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:41.150]  Okay. Yeah, that's nuts.
[01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:43.330]  Two people, two people
[01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:44.310]  in this recording.
[01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:50.850]  Jason Sanders. Dogfight
[01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:51.970]  over who got to pick him.
[01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.890]  Gavin, you got Giants' Greg
[01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:56.770]  Joseph and Jets' Greg Zerline.
[01:06:56.910 --> 01:06:57.630]  You're a Greg-heavy team.
[01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:00.950]  Guys, what does
[01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.830]  this mean for the future of the kicker-picker?
[01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.790]  So excited to find out. Thank you
[01:07:04.790 --> 01:07:06.730]  so much for watching. How do you feel like
[01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.790]  this went? Is it exactly what you thought
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.370]  it would be when you're watching this
[01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.310]  on your phone while you're making breakfast?
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:14.810]  Should we release this with a formal apology
[01:07:14.810 --> 01:07:16.770]  laugh? I think
[01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.350]  Andrew should have to record an apology.
[01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.630]  Me? You guys are spinning
[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:23.010]  the wheel back and forth for 40 minutes.
[01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:24.930]  You brought in stealing? We were just gonna pick.
[01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.550]  I brought in a wheel
[01:07:26.550 --> 01:07:28.710]  and then you put all the things on
[01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.770]  the wheel and then you said, what a shit
[01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.770]  wheel. You're the one that put all the stuff.
[01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:34.510]  It went to shit the second
[01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.690]  Andrew wrote steal on the
[01:07:36.690 --> 01:07:38.750]  wheel. Yep. That's when it became
[01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:40.830]  a different game. And in the end
[01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.690]  a better game, I think.
[01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:44.170]  I'm glad we did it.
[01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.790]  Same. That was a lot of fun. Yeah, I can't
[01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:48.270]  wait to have fajitas tonight, dude.
[01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.750]  I'm trying to think about where to get them from.
[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.730]  Congratulations, everybody, on your fajitas.
[01:07:52.890 --> 01:07:54.150]  Congratulations, Nick, on
[01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:56.390]  really becoming the best team
[01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.950]  overnight.
[01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.810]  I don't think I've ever had a fajita.
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.050]  I don't think I've ever had fajitas.
[01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.870]  That can't
[01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:05.750]  be true! I don't think I have.
[01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.010]  Have you had Mexican food?
[01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:09.950]  Yeah, but I always go for a burrito
[01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.650]  or a quesadilla.
[01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.870]  Okay. Let's
[01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:15.250]  go for steak fajitas tonight.
[01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.770]  Can I just ask before we go, what would everyone have
[01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:18.650]  put on the fourth wheel?
[01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:21.850]  That's tough. Honestly, I kind of want
[01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:23.850]  to hold my cards to my vest so that way
[01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:25.910]  when we do this again next year, I have all my ideas
[01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:27.630]  fresh and they're coming out like
[01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:28.790]  next year. You know what I mean?
[01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:31.410]  Next time we do anything, the wheels are going to show up.
[01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:33.190]  I was hoping it would have
