[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  Welcome, guys. We have a movie we're going to be watching tonight.
[00:03.720 --> 00:07.160]  However, I want to know, if you're in the chat, let us know.
[00:07.300 --> 00:09.620]  Why did you pick this one and not the other movies?
[00:09.700 --> 00:11.900]  Or if you pick the other movies...
[00:11.900 --> 00:13.200]  Because this was the best.
[00:13.440 --> 00:14.560]  How are you feeling? Is that right?
[00:15.160 --> 00:17.820]  I think mine even had a little bit of nudity in it, too, damn it.
[00:17.860 --> 00:19.720]  Oh, what? No!
[00:20.280 --> 00:21.820]  I don't think there's nudity in this one.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.340]  No? There's a dead guy with some mouse nipples.
[00:26.640 --> 00:29.480]  Yeah, we're more hung up on tits than death.
[00:33.540 --> 00:36.560]  Because we will be watching Mouse Hunt.
[00:36.820 --> 00:39.240]  Mouse Hunt is the winner today.
[00:42.100 --> 00:44.060]  Andrew, whose pick was this?
[00:44.760 --> 00:45.940]  This is Gavin's pick.
[00:46.560 --> 00:47.540]  Gavin picked Mouse Hunt.
[00:48.040 --> 00:52.280]  This is in recent lore because I was saying it's the third best home alone film.
[00:53.140 --> 00:55.280]  It's true. Yeah, that's why this came up.
[00:55.640 --> 00:57.160]  I will judge that today, I guess.
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.560]  Yep. So who's alone?
[00:59.560 --> 01:01.060]  It is the third best. Is it the mouse?
[01:02.280 --> 01:03.460]  Yeah, the mouse is alone.
[01:03.660 --> 01:04.660]  Yeah. Don't you think?
[01:05.140 --> 01:06.020]  Yeah, Mouse McAllister.
[01:07.320 --> 01:08.120]  Mouse McAllister?
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.360]  Fair enough.
[01:11.660 --> 01:15.160]  I got to respect all of the Falcons in here who didn't vote for the film.
[01:15.300 --> 01:16.560]  And I just tear out of love anyway.
[01:16.960 --> 01:18.900]  Yeah, I appreciate you guys.
[01:19.020 --> 01:23.060]  Are there any of the 11% that voted for Air Force One currently in this chat?
[01:23.920 --> 01:26.540]  I want to know who's bummed that we're not watching Air Force One.
[01:27.240 --> 01:28.980]  Yeah. Who picked?
[01:29.340 --> 01:30.020]  Outside of Nick.
[01:30.520 --> 01:31.380]  That was a Nick one.
[01:31.520 --> 01:32.600]  But who voted for it?
[01:33.440 --> 01:34.680]  Yeah, who voted for the right movie?
[01:34.880 --> 01:36.960]  SpencerTBL voted for Air Force One.
[01:37.360 --> 01:37.720]  Nathan?
[01:39.360 --> 01:40.820]  Is Gary Oldman in Air Force One?
[01:41.980 --> 01:42.200]  Who?
[01:42.760 --> 01:44.280]  Gary Oldman. Is that him?
[01:44.420 --> 01:45.780]  OK. Yeah, he's my main bad guy.
[01:46.180 --> 01:46.780]  Main bad guy.
[01:47.020 --> 01:48.660]  Yes. I've never seen Air Force One.
[01:48.780 --> 01:49.280]  Yeah, neither have I.
[01:49.300 --> 01:50.300]  I probably would have voted for that.
[01:50.780 --> 01:51.680]  Well, you had the opportunity.
[01:52.100 --> 01:53.060]  That's true. You could have voted.
[01:53.220 --> 01:54.600]  You could have voted for it, Gavin.
[01:54.920 --> 01:55.540]  I'm not a Falcon.
[01:56.340 --> 01:57.060]  It's true.
[01:57.060 --> 01:57.960]  You could have done it.
[01:58.120 --> 02:01.640]  You could have voted the way that Nick does in every 100% eat poll.
[02:01.760 --> 02:02.900]  I don't do that anymore.
[02:05.720 --> 02:06.940]  I'm a couple time thing.
[02:07.340 --> 02:08.580]  I'm not a Falcon.
[02:08.700 --> 02:10.080]  I'm just protected by them.
[02:10.440 --> 02:11.640]  Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[02:11.700 --> 02:12.240]  That's a good point.
[02:13.260 --> 02:14.080]  But now it's Mouse Hunt.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.960]  We are recording this so that way you guys can do the watch along later
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.700]  if you're for some reason you have to leave early.
[02:20.060 --> 02:22.440]  Don't want you to have to, like, go crazy out of your way for it.
[02:22.440 --> 02:24.440]  But we will be watching this with you guys.
[02:24.540 --> 02:25.420]  We got the chat up.
[02:25.420 --> 02:29.100]  And then, uh, we're going to watch Mouse Hunt.
[02:29.260 --> 02:31.220]  It is, uh...
[02:31.220 --> 02:32.380]  Do I have to sigh when you say it?
[02:32.380 --> 02:35.580]  And this is, according to Gavin, the third best Home Alone film.
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.180]  But what he doesn't mention is that he doesn't like Home Alone one and two.
[02:39.300 --> 02:41.840]  He's referring to three and four as the other two best Home Alone films,
[02:41.980 --> 02:43.200]  which I think is weird.
[02:43.400 --> 02:44.580]  No, I don't get that.
[02:45.080 --> 02:47.460]  So this is Mouse Hunt from 1997.
[02:48.300 --> 02:50.980]  A total run length of one hour, 38 minutes
[02:50.980 --> 02:55.840]  directed by Gore Verbinski and written by Adam Rifkin.
[02:55.840 --> 02:56.920]  Still waiting on his Bioshock movie.
[02:57.720 --> 03:03.400]  Two stumblebum inheritors are determined to rid their antique house of a mouse
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.600]  who is equally determined to stay where he is.
[03:06.680 --> 03:10.620]  Starring Nathan Lane, Lee Evans and Vicky Lewis.
[03:11.680 --> 03:13.160]  Vicky Lewis? Oh, man.
[03:14.020 --> 03:14.760]  Is that the name of the mouse?
[03:15.040 --> 03:18.880]  Yeah. No, Vicky Lewis was Beth on News Radio.
[03:19.340 --> 03:20.740]  Oh, I love News Radio.
[03:20.740 --> 03:25.380]  Yeah, yeah. So let's let's check this out.
[03:25.700 --> 03:27.720]  Ninety seven was such a good lead up year.
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.600]  It's true. Good. A good pre year, I guess, is a tailgater of a year.
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.260]  Yeah, I feel like it was a pre along with ninety three.
[03:36.960 --> 03:39.960]  Ninety three. I think ninety two feels like a pre year.
[03:40.020 --> 03:42.100]  But boy, I could really feel ninety three is a pre year.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.100]  I could I could get on board with that big time.
[03:44.340 --> 03:45.280]  This year I graduated high school.
[03:45.780 --> 03:48.000]  I think ninety five was main year.
[03:48.220 --> 03:49.840]  I think ninety five could be a main year.
[03:49.840 --> 03:52.080]  I think ninety four is pretty close to being a main year, though.
[03:53.220 --> 03:55.640]  Ninety four feels like a big year, doesn't it, Geoff?
[03:55.800 --> 03:56.520]  It was a big year. It was a big year.
[03:56.600 --> 03:57.360]  It was the year Kurt Cobain died.
[03:58.160 --> 04:00.000]  Oh, big year. Five.
[04:00.340 --> 04:02.360]  That sounded like Nick was making fun of you.
[04:02.700 --> 04:03.620]  Three. No, I like that.
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.940]  That's the first thing I think of in ninety four.
[04:05.340 --> 04:05.660]  I don't know why.
[04:06.340 --> 04:08.020]  Well, it's not. No, Andrew, that's not the countdown.
[04:09.780 --> 04:11.720]  One, two, three. One, two, three.
[04:13.460 --> 04:15.380]  All right. Are you all ready?
[04:15.680 --> 04:16.600]  Yeah. All right.
[04:17.340 --> 04:24.660]  And for everybody listening later in five, four, three, two, one, go.
[04:25.120 --> 04:26.460]  Oh, you almost lost the play button.
[04:26.800 --> 04:28.420]  It's almost vanished.
[04:28.660 --> 04:29.700]  I had to keep moving it around.
[04:31.800 --> 04:32.880]  Framerate's a piece of shit.
[04:34.060 --> 04:34.920]  Why don't you do something about that, Nick?
[04:37.720 --> 04:39.000]  Catch the mouse.
[04:39.500 --> 04:41.000]  Move off the goddamn screen.
[04:41.540 --> 04:44.760]  It's like, uh, like we did a test for this earlier
[04:44.760 --> 04:46.740]  and Gavin didn't have anything to say about this part.
[04:47.440 --> 04:49.100]  Well, it didn't look like that.
[04:51.220 --> 04:52.580]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[04:53.880 --> 04:55.460]  Nick, what happened? What are you doing?
[04:56.000 --> 04:57.280]  What are you doing, Nick?
[04:57.440 --> 04:58.700]  A word without frames is chaos.
[04:59.000 --> 04:59.620]  What's happening?
[05:01.560 --> 05:04.160]  Do you want to take a second and restart?
[05:04.940 --> 05:06.480]  Restart what? What's the problem?
[05:07.280 --> 05:10.920]  I can't get the pause button to get off the screen.
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.820]  No, I think this is how Gore Verbinski wanted us to watch this.
[05:17.960 --> 05:19.180]  Oh, yeah. All right.
[05:19.260 --> 05:22.260]  Oh, wow. Did you just have to not move the mouse for like seven seconds?
[05:22.660 --> 05:25.220]  I didn't move it for a very, very long time.
[05:25.240 --> 05:27.560]  This looks like the start of a Batman movie right here.
[05:27.580 --> 05:29.160]  It does. Yeah, or The Godfather.
[05:29.520 --> 05:31.840]  Well, Mouse Hunt is like the third best Batman movie.
[05:32.300 --> 05:32.960]  I've heard that.
[05:34.280 --> 05:37.400]  Well, once again, Gavin only likes Val Kilmer as Batman, so strange.
[05:41.950 --> 05:44.750]  And this is the this is for the mouse.
[05:46.070 --> 05:47.670]  The coffin? Yeah.
[05:47.770 --> 05:48.670]  It's a big mouse.
[05:49.030 --> 05:50.210]  That's what I was saying.
[05:50.390 --> 05:51.230]  I think that's crazy.
[05:53.650 --> 05:55.390]  What's going on with the picture?
[05:56.210 --> 05:56.530]  What?
[05:57.150 --> 05:58.970]  They're like jittering all over the place.
[05:59.510 --> 06:00.730]  Oh, what is it? Why are you doing that?
[06:01.330 --> 06:02.430]  Can everyone else see that?
[06:02.870 --> 06:04.450]  Nick has to move the mouse again. Hang on.
[06:04.670 --> 06:06.150]  Hey, Gavin, are you wired?
[06:07.330 --> 06:08.690]  There goes the frame rate.
[06:11.330 --> 06:13.470]  Oh, hell yeah.
[06:13.510 --> 06:17.070]  No! Was that the uncle from Christmas Vacation?
[06:17.190 --> 06:19.150]  Yeah, it's the old guy from Christmas Vacation.
[06:20.010 --> 06:22.050]  When his hair gets set on fire.
[06:22.550 --> 06:22.730]  Yeah.
[06:24.310 --> 06:25.250]  Nothing but net.
[06:25.330 --> 06:26.150]  How'd they do that?
[06:27.350 --> 06:28.550]  They're like, Jesus Christ.
[06:28.750 --> 06:31.810]  And sometimes you pack the cat away again.
[06:32.370 --> 06:34.070]  Backwards. What?
[06:35.210 --> 06:37.910]  Is there people not seeing the movie like skip backwards and forwards?
[06:38.430 --> 06:39.910]  No, no, no.
[06:40.130 --> 06:41.230]  Nick, no, it's not.
[06:41.350 --> 06:43.370]  There has not been any problem at all.
[06:43.810 --> 06:44.910]  We're watching Thread.
[06:45.550 --> 06:46.990]  I'm seeing a little bit, a little bit.
[06:48.470 --> 06:51.790]  I'm not getting to the frequency in which I am not getting it.
[06:51.890 --> 06:53.150]  I'm not getting it at all.
[06:58.110 --> 06:59.710]  OK, they'll see it.
[07:01.590 --> 07:02.030]  Smuts.
[07:02.370 --> 07:06.010]  Are they are they doing a thing or are they for real?
[07:06.010 --> 07:06.850]  That's a good question.
[07:08.110 --> 07:10.490]  I didn't know that streamer Ludwig is in this.
[07:10.490 --> 07:11.610]  Hold on. I'm going to vomit.
[07:11.810 --> 07:13.530]  OK, we're going to hold up. We're going to hold on.
[07:13.610 --> 07:15.010]  We're going to hold on. That's fucking great.
[07:15.770 --> 07:18.070]  OK, I know what to do. It's all right.
[07:18.450 --> 07:19.430]  Oh, what do you need to do?
[07:19.850 --> 07:22.730]  I'm just going to change the stream quality.
[07:23.230 --> 07:23.870]  Michael Jeter?
[07:25.030 --> 07:25.770]  Oh, Derek's brother?
[07:26.310 --> 07:26.550]  Yeah.
[07:28.670 --> 07:29.850]  See if that does a difference.
[07:31.270 --> 07:36.830]  I got to say, Zach Efron's brother is on the Traders and he's pretty likable.
[07:37.290 --> 07:40.090]  Really? Yeah, he's pretty likable.
[07:41.970 --> 07:43.630]  Captain Stray's brother, though.
[07:47.820 --> 07:49.060]  This is looking better for me.
[07:49.500 --> 07:51.440]  How do you feel, Gavin? Yeah, looking right.
[07:51.820 --> 07:53.040]  I think he's looking good. You did a great job, Nick.
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.280]  Good job.
[07:55.380 --> 07:56.720]  Oh, it's looking so much better now.
[07:57.680 --> 08:00.620]  Um, do you think that barrel is a somebody?
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.440]  Do you think it's a prop in Call of Duty or is it a real barrel?
[08:04.580 --> 08:06.660]  Let's wait 40 seconds and see if it whistles.
[08:09.220 --> 08:10.000]  Uh oh.
[08:10.360 --> 08:13.140]  So the mouse did this?
[08:15.160 --> 08:15.680]  No.
[08:18.220 --> 08:20.480]  I just don't understand what this has to do with a mouse.
[08:21.680 --> 08:22.820]  It's the build up to the mouse.
[08:23.400 --> 08:23.660]  Oh.
[08:24.080 --> 08:25.600]  This is how the mouse is born.
[08:25.920 --> 08:26.920]  This is his origin story.
[08:28.360 --> 08:29.480]  It is like Batman.
[08:30.040 --> 08:30.340]  Yeah.
[08:33.600 --> 08:35.060]  And he's made out of string?
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.360]  He's going to fall into a vat of radioactive string.
[08:45.500 --> 08:46.860]  That I do see.
[08:50.440 --> 08:51.660]  Why is it doing that?
[08:53.760 --> 08:55.220]  Oh, there's string everywhere.
[08:58.100 --> 08:58.900]  Silly string?
[08:59.420 --> 09:00.180]  Do I...
[09:00.180 --> 09:02.920]  Is it jumping back and forth in time for anybody else or is it just me?
[09:02.920 --> 09:03.060]  Yeah.
[09:03.060 --> 09:03.340]  No.
[09:05.120 --> 09:08.160]  I have not had it jump back and forth in time.
[09:11.080 --> 09:14.680]  If you give me two seconds, I will fix it.
[09:14.980 --> 09:15.060]  Okay.
[09:15.140 --> 09:19.820]  But the movie will continue to run or we can start it over again for the people who are watching later.
[09:20.760 --> 09:21.620]  What are your thoughts?
[09:22.120 --> 09:22.820]  Just let it run.
[09:23.520 --> 09:23.960]  Let it run.
[09:24.480 --> 09:24.920]  Two seconds.
[09:25.600 --> 09:25.760]  Okay.
[09:29.240 --> 09:32.980]  We tested this out before, earlier today, you guys.
[09:34.380 --> 09:35.420]  That we did.
[09:37.820 --> 09:40.260]  Alright, you're being a bit pedantic.
[09:43.220 --> 09:43.820]  One!
[09:47.020 --> 09:48.280]  Andrew's only up to one.
[09:48.900 --> 09:49.280]  Hold on.
[09:49.280 --> 09:50.120]  Give it a three count.
[09:50.700 --> 09:51.200]  Oh no.
[09:51.700 --> 09:52.180]  Okay.
[09:53.420 --> 09:53.800]  Two!
[09:54.520 --> 09:55.740]  Oh, you better help me.
[09:55.740 --> 09:58.180]  Nick, you better hope Andrew doesn't get the three.
[09:58.440 --> 09:58.940]  Now look at that.
[09:59.020 --> 09:59.760]  That looks fantastic.
[10:00.280 --> 10:01.200]  Oh, he kicked out!
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.420]  Is that better?
[10:05.380 --> 10:05.840]  Yeah, Gavin.
[10:05.900 --> 10:06.360]  How does that look?
[10:06.720 --> 10:07.180]  Way better.
[10:08.620 --> 10:09.500]  Gavin left.
[10:11.680 --> 10:13.700]  Now it's out of sync with the audio.
[10:18.220 --> 10:19.980]  Pause it one time and then pause it again.
[10:20.180 --> 10:20.960]  Oh my god.
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.100]  How is this a company?
[10:24.160 --> 10:25.460]  It's hardly a company.
[10:25.960 --> 10:26.520]  That's a good point.
[10:27.480 --> 10:30.240]  Turns out you just gotta throw LLC in front of some letters.
[10:32.980 --> 10:33.480]  That's right.
[10:33.540 --> 10:35.780]  You throw LLC in front of some letters.
[10:37.420 --> 10:39.920]  You spin a big wheel and you're like, hey, can I have a W?
[10:40.200 --> 10:42.920]  Hey, we're LLC Regulation Company.
[10:47.600 --> 10:48.500]  Now it's in sync.
[10:48.880 --> 10:49.500]  Now it's in sync.
[10:49.980 --> 10:50.300]  Alright.
[10:51.300 --> 10:52.640]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[10:56.910 --> 10:57.310]  Nope.
[10:58.450 --> 10:59.030]  Sort of.
[10:59.130 --> 10:59.870]  Hard to tell.
[10:59.870 --> 11:02.310]  Sometimes movies just, I feel like, are a little out of sync.
[11:04.430 --> 11:05.470]  That's not true.
[11:06.030 --> 11:06.590]  That is true.
[11:06.770 --> 11:09.450]  Like a low-budget film where they don't record the audio?
[11:10.210 --> 11:12.370]  Yeah, you can have like shitty ADR.
[11:12.990 --> 11:14.450]  But usually not for the whole movie.
[11:15.370 --> 11:17.330]  Nick, I don't care that Eric Christmas is in this scene.
[11:18.310 --> 11:19.510]  I don't care that he is either.
[11:19.610 --> 11:21.050]  I would like this to go away now.
[11:21.470 --> 11:22.610]  Do you...
[11:23.790 --> 11:25.370]  Do you think you should move the mouse somewhere else?
[11:25.610 --> 11:26.970]  Do you think you can do something about it?
[11:27.950 --> 11:29.650]  Oh wait, Nathan Lane is in this?
[11:29.710 --> 11:29.950]  That works.
[11:30.230 --> 11:30.390]  Great.
[11:30.450 --> 11:31.530]  Oh, you fucking did it.
[11:31.610 --> 11:31.790]  Yeah.
[11:31.950 --> 11:32.270]  Great.
[11:33.170 --> 11:33.950]  Hey look, it's Nathan Lane.
[11:34.410 --> 11:36.490]  Would you say this is Nathan Lane in his prime?
[11:38.170 --> 11:38.570]  Birdhouse.
[11:39.050 --> 11:39.410]  Or whatever.
[11:39.710 --> 11:40.870]  Isn't this around the same time?
[11:41.110 --> 11:41.130]  Birdcage.
[11:41.710 --> 11:42.110]  Birdcage.
[11:42.230 --> 11:43.770]  Wasn't that the same time frame as this?
[11:43.910 --> 11:44.350]  Let's see.
[11:44.570 --> 11:45.390]  I'm gonna look up Birdcage.
[11:45.770 --> 11:47.970]  I think Birdcage might have been a little before this.
[11:48.170 --> 11:48.930]  I think so too.
[11:49.230 --> 11:50.530]  I think it's within three years.
[11:51.930 --> 11:52.330]  1972.
[11:52.650 --> 11:52.950]  Oh no.
[11:53.470 --> 11:54.270]  That's the original.
[11:54.490 --> 11:54.670]  Yeah.
[11:57.390 --> 12:00.750]  Because it was like this, and that, and then Mrs. Doubtfire.
[12:02.570 --> 12:02.930]  1996.
[12:02.930 --> 12:03.930]  It was Mrs. Doubtfire?
[12:04.350 --> 12:04.730]  Wasn't he?
[12:05.150 --> 12:05.510]  No.
[12:06.870 --> 12:07.750]  It was Mrs. Doubtfire.
[12:07.890 --> 12:08.270]  Oh, never mind.
[12:08.350 --> 12:08.870]  No, no, no, no.
[12:09.330 --> 12:10.170]  I was thinking of the brother.
[12:10.410 --> 12:11.630]  Oh, you're thinking of Robin Williams, yeah.
[12:12.350 --> 12:13.410]  Oh yeah, that's who I was thinking of.
[12:13.410 --> 12:15.330]  He was Mrs. Doubtfire.
[12:15.670 --> 12:15.850]  Yeah.
[12:17.030 --> 12:18.830]  I thought we were about to get some Ratatouille action.
[12:19.210 --> 12:24.870]  Dude, when you go to Nathan Lane's IMDb movies he's known for, his top four,
[12:24.870 --> 12:32.750]  The Producers, The Birdcage, Lion King, Mouse Hunt.
[12:32.810 --> 12:33.470]  Hell yeah.
[12:34.670 --> 12:35.430]  Hell yeah.
[12:35.890 --> 12:36.410]  What a movie.
[12:40.660 --> 12:42.800]  I think more food should be served to you on fire.
[12:43.980 --> 12:45.560]  Just generally speaking.
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.160]  So, they own a string factory but he's a chef?
[12:52.600 --> 12:54.980]  I think the family's wealthy in string.
[12:54.980 --> 12:57.080]  I think the dad had the string factory.
[12:57.400 --> 13:00.140]  But the dad died, he got shoved down a sewer.
[13:00.680 --> 13:04.320]  Right, so they inherited the factory and some old house.
[13:07.660 --> 13:07.980]  Uh oh.
[13:10.880 --> 13:12.680]  Is this guy gonna choke and... yeah.
[13:13.700 --> 13:14.160]  He...
[13:14.160 --> 13:16.840]  Oh no.
[13:19.960 --> 13:20.880]  CG cockroach.
[13:20.980 --> 13:21.720]  Is this in 3D?
[13:23.360 --> 13:23.820]  Whoa!
[13:26.060 --> 13:26.820]  He's gonna hurl.
[13:33.180 --> 13:33.980]  Hell yeah.
[13:34.400 --> 13:35.300]  So just stab the table.
[13:35.360 --> 13:36.520]  Kid, just stab the table.
[13:36.700 --> 13:37.300]  We'll add it post.
[13:37.400 --> 13:37.740]  Don't worry.
[13:38.900 --> 13:39.940]  He fucking died?
[13:40.280 --> 13:40.980]  This is crazy.
[13:42.260 --> 13:44.340]  Dude, the body count on this film is already at 2.
[13:46.180 --> 13:48.480]  And they both own string factories.
[13:50.080 --> 13:50.700]  Hey, you know what?
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.800]  Kevin McCallister never put a man in the ground.
[13:53.820 --> 13:54.700]  That's a good point.
[13:54.780 --> 13:57.060]  But this guy's not Kevin McCallister.
[13:57.200 --> 13:59.600]  This guy's one of the wet bandits or whatever.
[14:00.700 --> 14:01.160]  Yeah.
[14:02.220 --> 14:05.220]  Well, they were the wet bandits in the second?
[14:05.300 --> 14:05.800]  First one.
[14:05.900 --> 14:06.200]  The first one.
[14:06.540 --> 14:07.960]  First was wet, second was sticky.
[14:08.300 --> 14:08.880]  It's that guy.
[14:10.520 --> 14:11.380]  Mark Ruffalo?
[14:11.900 --> 14:14.140]  No, the Mario something.
[14:14.620 --> 14:15.520]  Mario Puzo.
[14:16.780 --> 14:17.700]  Mario Cantone.
[14:18.200 --> 14:18.960]  I think that's his name.
[14:19.100 --> 14:20.040]  I think it's Mario Cantone.
[14:20.040 --> 14:24.920]  He was like, he's in like all those I love the 80s, but then also Sex and the City.
[14:25.520 --> 14:25.680]  Yeah.
[14:25.780 --> 14:26.800]  That guy, Mario Cantone.
[14:27.220 --> 14:28.120]  Mario Luigi.
[14:28.780 --> 14:29.940]  Mario T. Plumber.
[14:30.520 --> 14:33.420]  I don't understand how that's actually making a ball of string.
[14:34.060 --> 14:35.960]  It's not just turning a ball of string.
[14:36.540 --> 14:37.740]  It looks like it is, yes.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.840]  I have like a lot of questions.
[14:41.220 --> 14:45.700]  Like this movie is very confusing to me in like very basic ways.
[14:46.940 --> 14:49.500]  The Mafia wants to buy the string?
[14:50.640 --> 14:51.860]  The factory, I guess.
[14:52.540 --> 14:54.920]  This is back when string was very important.
[14:57.180 --> 14:58.900]  Do you think string's out these days?
[14:59.340 --> 15:00.580]  Oh, string's way out, yeah.
[15:00.720 --> 15:02.300]  We have like Facebook and stuff now, dude.
[15:02.300 --> 15:03.280]  You don't even need string.
[15:03.780 --> 15:07.440]  Most of our bullets in WW2 were full of string.
[15:08.680 --> 15:10.580]  You kill people with a staph infection.
[15:10.840 --> 15:11.980]  We have threads.
[15:12.920 --> 15:13.440]  Stupid.
[15:17.960 --> 15:19.160]  Geoff, you ever have MRSA?
[15:20.220 --> 15:20.580]  No.
[15:21.300 --> 15:21.660]  Okay.
[15:22.320 --> 15:23.080]  Why, have you?
[15:23.500 --> 15:24.140]  No, no, no.
[15:24.300 --> 15:24.860]  I was just curious.
[15:25.800 --> 15:29.340]  Just seems like it's a thing that like some people get sometimes and you just go like,
[15:29.400 --> 15:30.340]  holy shit, you had MRSA?
[15:30.440 --> 15:31.440]  Just seems like one of those things.
[15:31.740 --> 15:33.040]  Nah, I've never really been sick.
[15:34.180 --> 15:34.540]  That's...
[15:35.900 --> 15:36.600]  Is that right?
[15:36.800 --> 15:37.860]  That's really good news.
[15:37.960 --> 15:41.640]  Yeah, I get a lot of shit related problems, but that's pretty much it.
[15:41.900 --> 15:44.700]  But you don't consider that part of your health?
[15:45.720 --> 15:46.840]  I get butt sick.
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.560]  I don't get like other kinds of sick.
[15:48.620 --> 15:51.020]  Have you heard of a term called dental health?
[15:51.260 --> 15:51.400]  Yeah.
[15:52.080 --> 15:52.480]  Oh.
[15:52.960 --> 15:54.840]  Yeah, I guess I get mouth sick sometimes.
[15:56.020 --> 15:58.080]  But at least it's all connected, right?
[15:58.140 --> 15:59.780]  It's like the front hole and the back hole.
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.620]  It's just one long string.
[16:00.620 --> 16:06.160]  Geoff, you were so mouth sick that you may have phantom mouth sickness.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.120]  Yeah, I know.
[16:07.320 --> 16:07.980]  Tell me about it.
[16:08.120 --> 16:12.520]  I tried to go to an endodontist this week and it was out of network, so now I gotta figure out what my...
[16:12.520 --> 16:18.100]  The same endodontist I went to fucking four times over the last three years is now no longer in our network.
[16:18.420 --> 16:18.820]  Great.
[16:20.620 --> 16:24.360]  This actor genuinely looks like he was on the brink of death.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.760]  Maybe he just acted really good.
[16:26.860 --> 16:27.940]  This has to be his last movie.
[16:28.140 --> 16:32.140]  Do you think they filmed this at his house when he was in hospice and that's his actual bed?
[16:32.640 --> 16:34.900]  I don't know. It's like too real, though. I don't like it.
[16:35.180 --> 16:40.080]  If you pull up the trivia, I believe he actually was dead and this was animatronic work with his body.
[16:40.660 --> 16:43.440]  He was like Tony Soprano's mom.
[16:44.840 --> 16:46.920]  That looks so bad. It's like the worst.
[16:47.460 --> 16:48.800]  A world without strange chaos.
[16:51.700 --> 16:52.300]  Oh, no.
[16:53.560 --> 16:55.340]  Oh, she's in Godzilla.
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.140]  Yes. Yeah.
[16:59.160 --> 16:59.900]  Which one?
[17:00.640 --> 17:01.520]  The Broderick one.
[17:01.800 --> 17:04.260]  Yeah, the one that came out in 97. Didn't it come out in 97?
[17:04.840 --> 17:07.500]  A big Japanese monster terrorized New York.
[17:07.640 --> 17:08.840]  Not the one from 90's Fire.
[17:08.840 --> 17:10.320]  It might have been 98, honestly.
[17:10.500 --> 17:11.020]  Was it really?
[17:12.020 --> 17:15.300]  I know the song was, so I assume the movie came out the same year.
[17:15.460 --> 17:17.300]  Come with me! Yeah, 98.
[17:20.040 --> 17:20.740]  Oh, that lady.
[17:21.480 --> 17:21.940]  Yeah, it's Beth.
[17:22.060 --> 17:22.420]  She's in Godzilla.
[17:22.880 --> 17:26.180]  Oh, that's the news radio lady.
[17:27.220 --> 17:28.220]  Beth from News Radio.
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.000]  You know who else is on News Radio?
[17:33.340 --> 17:34.800]  Fucking whole cast of other people.
[17:35.440 --> 17:36.480]  I don't know. I don't watch that shit.
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.400]  You know who was on that show?
[17:38.400 --> 17:39.200]  Joe Rogan.
[17:39.500 --> 17:40.960]  God, I love Phil Hartman.
[17:41.880 --> 17:44.780]  Probably John Lovitz. I think he replaced him when Phil Hartman died or something.
[17:44.940 --> 17:46.180]  Yes, that is true.
[17:47.660 --> 17:49.640]  If only this mouse died instead of him.
[17:53.770 --> 17:57.370]  Vicky Lewis, also the voice of Deb from Finding Nemo.
[17:57.790 --> 17:58.330]  Who's Deb?
[17:58.750 --> 17:59.330]  Who's Deb?
[17:59.610 --> 18:03.410]  If you could go back in time and kill a mouse for $1000, would you?
[18:04.530 --> 18:05.190]  I don't think so.
[18:05.830 --> 18:06.290]  No, I wouldn't.
[18:06.290 --> 18:07.310]  Your uncle is so happy.
[18:07.630 --> 18:09.030]  Wait, is he paying or getting paid?
[18:09.450 --> 18:10.370]  He's gotta pay to kill it.
[18:10.630 --> 18:11.810]  Oh, definitely not.
[18:12.290 --> 18:14.130]  Yeah, but this was Christopher Reeve's mouse.
[18:16.650 --> 18:18.250]  Christopher Reeve's kid's mouse.
[18:18.730 --> 18:20.610]  This is the mouse that scared the horse.
[18:20.810 --> 18:21.070]  The horse?
[18:21.210 --> 18:23.310]  Yeah, that kicked Christopher Reeve off.
[18:23.590 --> 18:24.870]  I had the same thought.
[18:25.110 --> 18:28.690]  You have to consider that horses are afraid of mice like elephants.
[18:32.130 --> 18:35.170]  Do elephants ever actually shit the bed when they see a mouse?
[18:35.470 --> 18:36.610]  I don't know. I'll look it up.
[18:37.070 --> 18:37.930]  That's a good question.
[18:38.230 --> 18:38.810]  Is elephant...
[18:41.530 --> 18:42.010]  afraid...
[18:42.010 --> 18:43.830]  We gotta test all these cartoon tropes.
[18:45.090 --> 18:49.890]  Oh wait, so because of the roach, that dude lost his fancy-ass restaurant?
[18:50.130 --> 18:51.770]  Yeah, because all the press was there.
[18:52.030 --> 18:53.570]  He killed the mayor.
[18:53.850 --> 18:56.610]  He was the mayor and he ate a cockroach head and died.
[18:57.210 --> 18:59.190]  Elephants die all the time from eating.
[18:59.650 --> 18:59.870]  What?
[19:01.790 --> 19:04.110]  People die all the time from eating?
[19:04.510 --> 19:05.770]  Yeah, you ever choke, bitch?
[19:09.450 --> 19:12.930]  Elephants are not afraid of mice is the consensus here.
[19:13.990 --> 19:14.430]  Okay.
[19:14.950 --> 19:18.130]  I've got some cartoons that might disagree with that.
[19:18.750 --> 19:21.050]  Just another lie from Big Mouse.
[19:22.550 --> 19:26.130]  Evil x-ray says I want to know if Gavin would lay on a bed of wet bread for a million dollars.
[19:28.230 --> 19:29.330]  I definitely would.
[19:29.370 --> 19:31.290]  It wouldn't be pretty, but I'd get right in there.
[19:31.730 --> 19:32.730]  Wait, for how long?
[19:34.850 --> 19:35.750]  A million seconds.
[19:37.350 --> 19:41.670]  You'd lay in a tres leches bed for a million dollars?
[19:42.170 --> 19:42.550]  Yeah.
[19:43.730 --> 19:44.810]  For ten minutes?
[19:46.410 --> 19:48.450]  That's a hundred thousand dollars a minute.
[19:49.890 --> 19:50.910]  That's a good bunt.
[19:53.050 --> 19:57.990]  I'd probably throw up minute four and then I'd just be laughing all the way to the bank.
[19:58.270 --> 20:04.010]  What if the only caveat is you can't change clothes or take a shower until the next day?
[20:04.010 --> 20:06.630]  So you have to go about the rest of your business in the wet milk bread.
[20:07.550 --> 20:08.170]  Yeah, that's fine.
[20:08.770 --> 20:12.170]  Wow. What if you also had to go back in time and kill a mouse?
[20:13.070 --> 20:16.530]  But it still costs you a thousand dollars to do that.
[20:16.790 --> 20:18.650]  But the mouse was literally Hitler.
[20:23.430 --> 20:25.450]  Go ahead and say no now, asshole. You can't do it.
[20:27.190 --> 20:29.030]  You ready to pony up that thousand?
[20:31.430 --> 20:33.090]  Still got 999 grand left.
[20:36.050 --> 20:37.030]  But he has string.
[20:38.030 --> 20:39.230]  Is this a Christmas movie?
[20:40.750 --> 20:41.930]  It's Christmas in the movie.
[20:43.310 --> 20:43.750]  Like Die Hard?
[20:45.370 --> 20:47.370]  Yeah, it's just like Christmas in the credits.
[20:48.250 --> 20:50.350]  I mean, the body count matches time-wise so far.
[20:52.030 --> 20:55.990]  I think more people have died in this movie than they have in Die Hard by this point.
[20:57.370 --> 20:58.550]  I think you're right, yeah.
[20:58.810 --> 21:02.190]  Well, I think all he's done at this point in Die Hard is pick up his luggage.
[21:02.190 --> 21:07.910]  Yeah, he like made fists with his toes and then he's riding around with Argyle.
[21:07.950 --> 21:08.290]  Yeah.
[21:09.910 --> 21:10.930]  Ah, the house.
[21:12.570 --> 21:14.110]  You have fond memories of this house?
[21:16.550 --> 21:18.790]  Been a lot of your childhood daydreaming about this house?
[21:19.310 --> 21:20.570]  I bet I'd be sick to live there.
[21:21.590 --> 21:22.870]  It's full of mice.
[21:24.370 --> 21:27.650]  Well, it's not full of mouse. It's full of mouse, Geoff.
[21:29.390 --> 21:30.950]  There's a mouse in that house.
[21:35.230 --> 21:39.130]  Mouse not mouse, Geoff. Oh man, let's see how we survive that not that first.
[21:39.210 --> 21:42.170]  I don't, the guys, I don't know. It's gonna be something.
[21:42.650 --> 21:44.290]  I'm already ready to argue tomorrow.
[21:44.650 --> 21:48.950]  The way some of these people are interpreting some of this stuff is crazy. I just don't.
[21:52.600 --> 21:53.720]  Pops never told them?
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.640]  I feel like they could have started the movie right there on that line.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.040]  Yeah, it's huge.
[22:02.540 --> 22:05.220]  This is where pop used to breed super mice.
[22:06.440 --> 22:08.660]  What? Nick, I don't think we're watching the same movie.
[22:10.280 --> 22:12.860]  Well, that's what they find out later when they're terrorized by the mice.
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.200]  Spoilers!
[22:15.760 --> 22:17.220]  What's everybody eating for dinner tonight?
[22:18.220 --> 22:19.060]  Chicken and rice.
[22:19.540 --> 22:20.120]  Yeah, probably.
[22:21.260 --> 22:21.700]  Cockroaches.
[22:23.860 --> 22:25.380]  One half of a cockroach.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.600]  Wait, are you guys eating the same meal? Did you coordinate that?
[22:29.100 --> 22:29.360]  Yeah.
[22:31.000 --> 22:32.800]  What kind of chicken and rice are you having, Gavin?
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.960]  Just regular chicken with rice.
[22:36.900 --> 22:38.340]  How are you preparing the chicken?
[22:39.360 --> 22:40.120]  Chop it up.
[22:42.260 --> 22:43.680]  And then you'd cook it in some way?
[22:44.280 --> 22:45.700]  No, it's already cooked. It's like a registry.
[22:46.240 --> 22:49.240]  Oh, thank you. And then Eric, what's your chicken and rice look like?
[22:50.100 --> 22:56.760]  I made like a ginger sesame teriyaki chicken earlier this week, and so I'm getting through the rest of it.
[22:57.460 --> 22:58.320]  What do you got going on, Nick?
[22:59.360 --> 23:01.520]  I had tortilla soup that I made.
[23:01.860 --> 23:03.420]  Oh, right, you were soup talking earlier.
[23:03.960 --> 23:07.360]  Now imagine you wake up and every day you flip a coin.
[23:20.940 --> 23:24.640]  When was the last time you slept in bed with another dude?
[23:28.120 --> 23:29.360]  Let me think.
[23:30.940 --> 23:31.500]  Tuesday.
[23:34.700 --> 23:35.660]  This is tough.
[23:42.640 --> 23:44.060]  2004 would be my guess.
[23:44.640 --> 23:44.960]  Oh, wow.
[23:48.320 --> 23:50.560]  Funny, mine's probably not that far off of that as well.
[23:51.580 --> 23:56.980]  It was around season two of Red vs. Blue when we realized we could afford two hotel rooms.
[23:57.700 --> 24:02.740]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, a lot of Mega64 was like, all right, how are we doing this?
[24:03.060 --> 24:04.360]  And I was doing that.
[24:04.800 --> 24:07.780]  Gus and I used to sleep head to toe a lot back in the early days.
[24:09.040 --> 24:10.540]  What? Does that help?
[24:12.540 --> 24:18.460]  You just don't accidentally, like, fucking get spooned by Gus in the middle of the night, which happened once.
[24:19.100 --> 24:21.480]  You'd still get spooned, it's just a really weird position.
[24:21.480 --> 24:23.540]  No, the worst case scenario, you just get like a kick in the face.
[24:24.020 --> 24:24.820]  That's way worse.
[24:25.660 --> 24:29.180]  You don't want to be nuzzled by Gus's fucking five o'clock shadow, dude.
[24:29.520 --> 24:30.640]  That's a weird way to wake up.
[24:30.940 --> 24:33.580]  I don't know, man, your genitals are lined up now with your face.
[24:34.460 --> 24:34.940]  Wait, what?
[24:36.000 --> 24:37.260]  If they're head to toe?
[24:37.740 --> 24:39.560]  You got your balls on your ankles while you talk?
[24:43.060 --> 24:44.780]  No wonder Nick's a foot guy.
[24:44.980 --> 24:47.040]  Yeah, no kidding. I don't like feet.
[24:48.040 --> 24:48.800]  Jesus Christ.
[24:53.800 --> 24:55.100]  It's only a toy.
[24:56.020 --> 24:56.840]  Did he give up?
[24:58.900 --> 25:03.180]  Like, I feel like he's in a bunch of movies at this time, and then he just, like, stopped.
[25:03.740 --> 25:05.220]  I mean, he's not known for movies, really.
[25:06.200 --> 25:12.140]  Yeah, like, I meant, like, was he rejected, or did he just decide, you know what, I don't need to be a Hollywood star.
[25:12.500 --> 25:14.980]  I think he wanted to spend more time with family, and then he, like, fully retired.
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.400]  Really, what's he do now?
[25:18.160 --> 25:18.580]  He's retired.
[25:19.440 --> 25:21.980]  Owns a string factory. Supports his son, Chris.
[25:22.640 --> 25:23.900]  Spends time with family, I guess.
[25:24.540 --> 25:25.320]  It's the mouse!
[25:26.720 --> 25:27.040]  Finally!
[25:30.040 --> 25:31.560]  How long did it take to get to the mouse?
[25:32.440 --> 25:33.480]  I don't know, don't move the mouse.
[25:33.620 --> 25:35.260]  Alright, well, 21 minutes.
[25:35.420 --> 25:36.060]  Nick moved the mouse.
[25:37.500 --> 25:39.180]  I moved the mouse to see when we saw the mouse.
[25:39.840 --> 25:42.800]  For some reason, people's heads going through the ceiling is always funny.
[25:43.000 --> 25:43.620]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[25:44.500 --> 25:48.260]  Yeah, limbs going through any floor, I think, is funny. Forward or down.
[25:48.480 --> 25:49.140]  Up or down, yeah.
[25:49.860 --> 25:50.220]  Oh!
[25:53.360 --> 26:01.920]  Oh, by the way, Andrew, I was listening to a bit of Howard Stern the other day, and they had a doctor on who was talking about, like, the best shitting practices.
[26:02.420 --> 26:02.760]  Uh-huh.
[26:03.140 --> 26:07.680]  And he said that vertical wiping is considered the healthiest way to...
[26:07.680 --> 26:08.440]  Oh, interesting.
[26:08.440 --> 26:11.260]  ...to eliminate. So you're ahead of the game. Just wanted to throw that out there.
[26:11.360 --> 26:11.760]  Hell yeah.
[26:18.780 --> 26:20.720]  This movie suddenly got really good.
[26:21.220 --> 26:21.740]  That guy!
[26:22.840 --> 26:23.900]  Oh yeah, that guy.
[26:25.600 --> 26:28.700]  You know, he looks the same today as he does 30 years ago.
[26:28.700 --> 26:29.180]  That Rorschach?
[26:32.680 --> 26:34.480]  Oh, they're locked in there with him. Uh-oh.
[26:34.620 --> 26:35.360]  Cool shot, bro.
[26:40.670 --> 26:44.870]  Yeah, the... Gore Verbinski being chosen to make this is such an interesting choice.
[26:46.470 --> 26:48.310]  Oh my god, is that the dude who...
[26:49.590 --> 26:51.530]  ...is Elmo's buddy on Sesame Street?
[26:51.590 --> 26:56.210]  Yeah, and he gets killed in Jurassic Park 3. The raptor.
[26:58.230 --> 27:00.250]  I don't remember Jurassic Park 3 at all.
[27:00.270 --> 27:01.090]  I think I've seen that one.
[27:01.090 --> 27:01.830]  They use him as a bait.
[27:01.850 --> 27:02.790]  It was good. It was good.
[27:02.790 --> 27:03.970]  Oh, we gotta help Mr. Whatever.
[27:04.170 --> 27:07.210]  And then the raptor puts a claw in his back. He's like...
[27:07.210 --> 27:08.390]  You don't remember the dream?
[27:08.670 --> 27:08.970]  Alan!
[27:12.070 --> 27:14.670]  The raptor talks to him in the dream.
[27:14.970 --> 27:16.450]  Oh my god, that's awesome.
[27:16.730 --> 27:17.070]  Come on.
[27:20.110 --> 27:20.570]  600k.
[27:21.810 --> 27:23.550]  I wonder how many of these people are dead now.
[27:24.070 --> 27:24.810]  Vincent D'Onofrio?
[27:25.790 --> 27:26.150]  He's alive.
[27:29.790 --> 27:31.490]  Oh, who's... Oh, this guy.
[27:32.190 --> 27:34.950]  Oh, he played Weinstein in Entourage. That's how I know this guy.
[27:35.050 --> 27:36.210]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yup.
[27:44.880 --> 27:46.260]  I want a mustache like that.
[27:46.620 --> 27:49.120]  I want the ugliest fake mustache.
[27:51.140 --> 27:57.160]  It's like the old way. It's like the Walt Disney style of mustache where it's just like so low, like on the lip.
[28:02.220 --> 28:05.500]  I feel like I was watching something the other day and somebody had a mustache like that.
[28:05.580 --> 28:07.300]  And it was just like, it looked so bizarre.
[28:09.780 --> 28:12.620]  They put a shitload into costuming.
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.680]  This is just... but here's the thing. This is just how movies used to look.
[28:18.820 --> 28:18.920]  I know, I know.
[28:18.920 --> 28:23.820]  This isn't like, wow, what a home run. This is just, movies don't look like this anymore.
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.780]  Like, they stopped putting effort into this. Yeah, I agree.
[28:27.320 --> 28:28.980]  Yeah, it's all screens and shit now.
[28:30.380 --> 28:32.800]  It is. It's all screens.
[28:34.040 --> 28:34.820]  You know what I mean.
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.700]  They're not even wearing clothes.
[28:36.700 --> 28:41.280]  They're just wearing balls and they superimpose the AI to clothes on.
[28:42.360 --> 28:43.700]  Those are part of the screens.
[28:44.860 --> 28:49.340]  I was thinking the same point, but then it's like, that is sort of what Marvel superhero movies are now.
[28:49.440 --> 28:51.820]  Like a portion, a large percentage of those suits.
[28:52.260 --> 28:52.560]  Oh, yeah.
[28:54.600 --> 28:56.360]  How much did he offer them just then?
[28:58.200 --> 28:59.520]  I was wrapped up.
[28:59.880 --> 29:00.940]  About like a million dollars.
[29:01.560 --> 29:02.440]  I was thinking about screens.
[29:07.620 --> 29:08.520]  He's very funny.
[29:20.440 --> 29:21.080]  Thank you.
[29:21.600 --> 29:25.860]  So you just have to keep the house for a week and then...
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.540]  Boy, those two do not look like brothers.
[29:31.160 --> 29:31.820]  Yeah, right.
[29:32.260 --> 29:33.100]  Nathan Lane and Lee Evans.
[29:33.640 --> 29:33.840]  Yeah.
[29:35.720 --> 29:37.300]  Maybe their mom has a dirty secret.
[29:38.540 --> 29:38.880]  Oh.
[29:51.270 --> 29:52.290]  I think they're in the money.
[29:52.310 --> 29:53.290]  Okay, now let's do it again. Take two.
[29:53.630 --> 29:55.070]  Yeah, I was going to say, how many takes was that?
[30:02.460 --> 30:03.160]  What a catch.
[30:03.160 --> 30:04.760]  How many takes that was.
[30:09.940 --> 30:11.340]  Oh, the rat is pissed.
[30:11.580 --> 30:12.320]  Oh, the rat.
[30:12.520 --> 30:13.000]  Ratcam.
[30:13.260 --> 30:13.740]  Ratcam.
[30:16.040 --> 30:17.300]  It's like the end of Godzilla.
[30:27.560 --> 30:31.300]  This is me trying to find the last collectible in a level of Ratatouille.
[30:32.020 --> 30:32.980]  No kidding.
[30:32.980 --> 30:33.400]  No kidding.
[30:36.100 --> 30:37.540]  Oh, what are those mouse holes?
[30:43.640 --> 30:48.480]  Do you think it's allowed to use another mouse's mouse hole or do you have to make your own hole?
[30:50.820 --> 30:53.520]  Well, it depends on what comes with the house and what doesn't.
[30:54.320 --> 30:55.860]  The olive, the olive from the cover.
[30:56.380 --> 30:57.100]  He rolled it back.
[30:57.580 --> 30:57.980]  Yeah.
[30:58.900 --> 31:00.120]  This mouse is fucking pale.
[31:05.320 --> 31:07.160]  Dude, I love olives.
[31:07.960 --> 31:08.260]  Yeah.
[31:08.680 --> 31:09.340]  They're the best.
[31:09.540 --> 31:10.820]  They're so good.
[31:12.060 --> 31:12.900]  I'm right there with you, buddy.
[31:13.420 --> 31:13.700]  I hate them.
[31:14.940 --> 31:16.800]  I like that other people like olives.
[31:17.380 --> 31:18.980]  They're so brined and tasty.
[31:20.480 --> 31:21.860]  Nice can of olives.
[31:23.060 --> 31:23.660]  Yes, please.
[31:24.020 --> 31:24.700]  I like how they look.
[31:24.860 --> 31:27.520]  I like the sound of the crunch of them.
[31:28.480 --> 31:29.140]  But I don't want one.
[31:29.760 --> 31:31.300]  Garlic stuff, jalapeno stuff.
[31:31.420 --> 31:31.640]  Do they crunch?
[31:32.320 --> 31:32.660]  Blue cheese.
[31:32.700 --> 31:33.100]  They can.
[31:35.440 --> 31:38.760]  They're definitely like, they definitely have some heft to them, you know?
[31:39.320 --> 31:41.500]  They're meaty for a vegetable.
[31:42.060 --> 31:44.820]  Boy, and a, and a martini one.
[31:45.900 --> 31:46.400]  Yeah.
[31:47.400 --> 31:48.780]  Those were, those were the days.
[31:52.140 --> 31:52.900]  Sorry, chef.
[31:53.140 --> 31:56.780]  I can still put them on my fingers.
[31:57.900 --> 31:58.980]  I still have that.
[32:00.620 --> 32:01.920]  We'll always have our fingers.
[32:02.840 --> 32:03.200]  Well.
[32:05.880 --> 32:07.540]  Green olives over black olives, I guess.
[32:07.620 --> 32:09.660]  I think they're both, they both have their place.
[32:09.660 --> 32:10.460]  They both have their, yeah.
[32:12.280 --> 32:14.940]  I'd rather have a Kalamata olive than a black olive, I think.
[32:15.560 --> 32:15.920]  Interesting.
[32:23.560 --> 32:25.980]  This, we should get a house like this as our office.
[32:28.560 --> 32:30.020]  It has to have the mouse.
[32:30.920 --> 32:33.360]  I guarantee if we get a house like this, it's going to have the mouse.
[32:41.960 --> 32:43.100]  Yeah, he's mocking you.
[32:43.100 --> 32:44.120]  Mm-hmm.
[32:55.440 --> 32:56.780]  Please cut to that happening.
[32:56.900 --> 32:57.920]  Please cut to that happening.
[32:58.140 --> 32:58.620]  I want to see.
[33:00.720 --> 33:01.860]  Definitely a lost opportunity.
[33:06.460 --> 33:07.720]  There he is, CD Cheerios!
[33:09.020 --> 33:09.340]  Yeah!
[33:11.960 --> 33:17.560]  Oh, this is Home Alone 3.
[33:21.800 --> 33:22.840]  You don't let him get away.
[33:22.920 --> 33:24.220]  Hit him with the soft end of the broom.
[33:25.520 --> 33:26.040]  Well.
[33:26.440 --> 33:28.500]  I mean, you know, wider area.
[33:29.000 --> 33:29.340]  Yeah.
[33:30.180 --> 33:31.560]  You could, like, hockey puck him.
[33:31.620 --> 33:33.800]  Might do some shock damage to him.
[33:38.380 --> 33:40.000]  Are we thinking hammer to the feet?
[33:40.200 --> 33:41.120]  This is great.
[33:41.360 --> 33:44.700]  This is the physical comedy and this is very funny.
[33:45.900 --> 33:46.120]  Oh!
[33:47.240 --> 33:53.100]  Oh, the sound on the broom is good.
[33:54.000 --> 33:55.840]  This is, this is very funny.
[34:00.290 --> 34:02.330]  Did you guys ever see that movie, A Tale of Two Sisters?
[34:02.930 --> 34:03.830]  Korean horror film?
[34:04.430 --> 34:04.610]  No.
[34:05.110 --> 34:05.310]  No.
[34:05.430 --> 34:08.930]  I would never, I'll never get on the ground and look in a fucking hole like that again.
[34:09.170 --> 34:10.130]  Oh, what?
[34:11.570 --> 34:12.430]  What was in the hole?
[34:13.130 --> 34:14.230]  Fucking evil girl.
[34:15.030 --> 34:16.070]  Oh, I'm out.
[34:16.950 --> 34:17.630]  Hell yeah!
[34:21.670 --> 34:24.710]  Dude, he's like an extreme sports mouse.
[34:26.550 --> 34:28.610]  That's a huge, huge wheel.
[34:28.610 --> 34:31.270]  What kind of cheese is that, do you think?
[34:32.170 --> 34:32.730]  Edam?
[34:34.090 --> 34:35.210]  How long does a mouse live?
[34:36.810 --> 34:40.110]  How long does a mouse live?
[34:40.130 --> 34:41.590]  I'd guess three years.
[34:42.650 --> 34:44.670]  Yeah, probably three to five, right?
[34:45.110 --> 34:47.690]  Mice usually live about 12 to 18 months.
[34:48.090 --> 34:49.210]  Oh, wow.
[34:49.250 --> 34:51.250]  So there's no way this mouse is still around.
[34:51.630 --> 34:56.330]  They probably went through a few during filming.
[34:58.170 --> 35:04.030]  And then other places are saying in other captivity for like pet mice, one and a half to three years.
[35:04.170 --> 35:05.330]  He ate that whole wheel.
[35:05.330 --> 35:06.570]  He ate the whole thing?
[35:07.910 --> 35:09.310]  That mouse is good as shit.
[35:09.490 --> 35:11.090]  He's definitely not making it to three years.
[35:11.090 --> 35:11.230]  Or not.
[35:11.710 --> 35:12.530]  He may never shit again.
[35:15.570 --> 35:19.470]  I wonder if mice could visit mice doctors if they could extend their lifespan.
[35:20.050 --> 35:20.330]  Yeah.
[35:21.070 --> 35:21.450]  That's the real question.
[35:21.450 --> 35:23.930]  Like you go check the mouse cardiologist and see, you know.
[35:24.970 --> 35:26.730]  God, how do they film all these shots?
[35:26.830 --> 35:28.050]  This must have been a bollock.
[35:29.570 --> 35:30.410]  It's all CGI.
[35:32.030 --> 35:33.210]  Oh, I love that.
[35:33.510 --> 35:33.950]  That's cute.
[35:35.070 --> 35:36.610]  Of course, he loves the foot shot.
[35:38.110 --> 35:39.450]  I don't like that.
[35:39.810 --> 35:41.990]  I hate when he moans when you talk about feet.
[35:42.250 --> 35:43.030]  He can't stop himself.
[35:43.110 --> 35:43.870]  Yeah, he can't stop.
[35:44.430 --> 35:46.090]  Oh, he's got a little bed.
[35:47.510 --> 35:49.630]  Oh, man.
[35:50.770 --> 35:51.610]  That's so sweet.
[35:51.790 --> 35:52.430]  It's adorable.
[35:53.930 --> 35:55.870]  That's the cutest shit I've ever seen.
[35:59.760 --> 36:01.160]  Mouse's house, goddamn.
[36:01.880 --> 36:02.840]  Oh, here he goes.
[36:03.160 --> 36:04.280]  Go to sleep, little buddy.
[36:04.500 --> 36:06.140]  He's gonna have some gnarly dreams.
[36:06.340 --> 36:07.300]  Gnarly cheese dreams.
[36:07.320 --> 36:08.100]  Dreaming about Hawaii.
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.420]  I long to be in Hawaii.
[36:11.680 --> 36:12.200]  No!
[36:12.620 --> 36:13.240]  Oh, shit!
[36:13.420 --> 36:13.720]  No!
[36:15.720 --> 36:16.240]  No!
[36:17.500 --> 36:18.020]  Jesus Christ.
[36:18.020 --> 36:19.440]  Little mouse in the...
[36:19.440 --> 36:20.660]  Oh, my God!
[36:22.460 --> 36:24.460]  I wonder how many mice they killed making this movie.
[36:25.420 --> 36:26.300]  Holy shit!
[36:29.960 --> 36:31.480]  What the hell are they doing?
[36:31.500 --> 36:32.300]  That looks so cool.
[36:32.580 --> 36:34.020]  What the fuck are they doing?
[36:34.040 --> 36:34.640]  Oh, I see.
[36:34.860 --> 36:36.420]  He's just putting on some new skirting.
[36:36.600 --> 36:38.200]  I don't think you need that many nails, but...
[36:38.200 --> 36:39.320]  No, absolutely not.
[36:41.180 --> 36:43.540]  This is a revenge film, and they don't even know it.
[36:44.780 --> 36:45.220]  Whoa!
[36:45.900 --> 36:46.260]  Okay.
[36:46.940 --> 36:47.500]  That was some...
[36:48.680 --> 36:49.440]  Whoa, the CG.
[36:56.220 --> 36:57.460]  Get out of there!
[36:57.740 --> 36:58.600]  Run away, mouse!
[36:58.600 --> 36:59.140]  Oh!
[37:02.180 --> 37:04.940]  Is there a movie auction thing where we can buy the mouse?
[37:06.160 --> 37:07.380]  We gotta save him!
[37:07.700 --> 37:08.620]  Maybe one of those nails.
[37:11.320 --> 37:14.040]  Also, you ever seen a nail gun release steam?
[37:15.060 --> 37:15.380]  No.
[37:17.240 --> 37:17.680]  Well...
[37:17.680 --> 37:19.020]  This isn't...
[37:19.600 --> 37:21.660]  This isn't set in present day, I don't think.
[37:22.380 --> 37:23.460]  Is it not?
[37:25.700 --> 37:26.140]  I...
[37:26.700 --> 37:28.060]  I mean, did you see the cars?
[37:28.800 --> 37:31.200]  Also, everybody wears a tie all the time.
[37:31.520 --> 37:32.320]  Oh, you know what?
[37:32.780 --> 37:33.160]  Okay.
[37:33.760 --> 37:35.440]  When do you think it's set?
[37:37.040 --> 37:37.900]  50s or something?
[37:39.380 --> 37:40.100]  Oh, really?
[37:40.440 --> 37:41.160]  I was guessing.
[37:41.780 --> 37:42.480]  It's back...
[37:42.480 --> 37:43.220]  Those are some old-ass cars.
[37:43.620 --> 37:44.820]  When does Mouse Hunt...
[37:44.820 --> 37:48.780]  Back before we outsourced all our string factory jobs to China.
[37:49.300 --> 37:50.780]  Oh, string was a big deal.
[37:51.980 --> 37:56.660]  Styles range humorously from the 1940s to the 1990s in Mouse Hunt.
[37:59.400 --> 38:00.240]  It's timeless.
[38:00.540 --> 38:03.260]  It is just set in the late 20th century, is all it says.
[38:03.700 --> 38:04.100]  Oh, okay.
[38:09.640 --> 38:10.940]  I bet it was fun as shit.
[38:14.260 --> 38:15.060]  Do you think that's them?
[38:15.740 --> 38:18.260]  Is this what the Nanaimo bathtub races are like?
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.600]  It's essentially this, yeah.
[38:20.800 --> 38:21.460]  That's great.
[38:22.000 --> 38:22.680]  When is that again?
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.620]  In July.
[38:25.040 --> 38:26.140]  We'll see you there.
[38:26.640 --> 38:27.380]  This July.
[38:35.220 --> 38:37.260]  You're fucking dead.
[38:38.140 --> 38:40.880]  Okay, now it's truly like the Nanaimo bathtub races.
[38:54.430 --> 38:55.530]  Like you did earlier.
[39:01.880 --> 39:03.380]  I have to saw that on Jackass.
[39:32.250 --> 39:33.930]  Oh my god.
[39:34.410 --> 39:36.570]  You did a slow-mo guys like this with Dan once.
[39:37.390 --> 39:37.910]  Yeah.
[39:46.220 --> 39:47.920]  Yeah, I've set a lot of mouse traps.
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.860]  Has one ever gone off in your hand and got you?
[39:53.460 --> 39:53.980]  Yep.
[39:54.720 --> 39:55.540]  Oh, damn.
[39:56.600 --> 39:57.780]  Can you live to tell the tale?
[39:59.980 --> 40:06.620]  The thing I always remember about the kind of trap thing is in the shield on FX,
[40:07.040 --> 40:11.780]  there was an episode where someone was putting rat traps in glory holes.
[40:12.540 --> 40:13.000]  Oh.
[40:17.540 --> 40:19.220]  It's just an episode around it.
[40:19.360 --> 40:23.900]  And it's like, I hope they catch the person who's doing that.
[40:26.860 --> 40:28.480]  Don't know if it ever got resolved though.
[40:29.160 --> 40:29.600]  Can't remember.
[40:29.780 --> 40:30.380]  Sure, sure.
[40:32.440 --> 40:34.360]  But Nick did stop setting the traps.
[40:34.360 --> 40:35.340]  I was gonna say.
[40:37.900 --> 40:40.200]  So in this situation, they're now danger Aaron.
[40:41.020 --> 40:41.240]  Yeah.
[40:41.240 --> 40:42.080]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[40:47.550 --> 40:49.090]  I watched you guys play this level.
[40:51.010 --> 40:55.390]  Yeah, but we have to go back down to go up because we forgot where the other thing...
[40:55.390 --> 40:55.890]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:55.970 --> 40:56.550]  No, I remember this.
[40:57.630 --> 40:58.530]  That's a great stunt.
[41:03.070 --> 41:06.030]  Do you think there was an actor rat and a stunt rat?
[41:06.610 --> 41:08.070]  Yeah, there's definitely...
[41:08.650 --> 41:10.170]  There's a stunt rat for sure.
[41:11.150 --> 41:13.670]  I'm pretty sure this rat actually does all of his own stunts.
[41:13.790 --> 41:15.110]  He's like the Tom Cruise of...
[41:15.790 --> 41:17.130]  Except for that rope swing, that was bullshit.
[41:18.810 --> 41:19.830]  On top of the can.
[41:22.910 --> 41:24.310]  Oh, this is great.
[41:25.250 --> 41:26.130]  Brick oven.
[41:27.030 --> 41:31.850]  Why is there a thing of cherries set out like that on top of the fridge?
[41:32.010 --> 41:32.610]  You mean a bowl?
[41:33.250 --> 41:35.030]  On top of the fridge full of cherries?
[41:36.050 --> 41:36.210]  Yeah.
[41:37.170 --> 41:37.990]  This is great.
[41:38.430 --> 41:39.990]  This is very funny.
[41:43.370 --> 41:44.550]  Oh, it's beam blading.
[41:44.550 --> 41:45.370]  Oh.
[41:48.470 --> 41:49.030]  Ding!
[41:54.590 --> 41:59.250]  Now, why? Why would you roll into it?
[42:00.070 --> 42:04.810]  You know, this is the single longest day of some PA's life.
[42:05.070 --> 42:08.770]  He or she still has fucking nightmares about it.
[42:09.570 --> 42:10.370]  All right, reset.
[42:10.850 --> 42:11.930]  It's on his face.
[42:12.290 --> 42:13.670]  We're all going to go to lunch. Go ahead and reset.
[42:13.670 --> 42:15.330]  Yeah, everybody else, that's lunch.
[42:15.470 --> 42:16.350]  That was good. One more time.
[42:16.470 --> 42:17.670]  We just get one more.
[42:19.890 --> 42:21.870]  Could you go ahead and set those up faster? We're losing light.
[42:22.030 --> 42:23.410]  He got the cheese and he got the olives.
[42:24.990 --> 42:25.770]  And some crackers.
[42:26.330 --> 42:26.650]  Wow.
[42:29.130 --> 42:32.590]  If he gets struck by lightning while he's trying to eat them, it'll be rather too late.
[42:33.490 --> 42:37.790]  What do you think is an actor when you have to come out of a closet covered in mousetraps and yell juice?
[42:38.590 --> 42:39.630]  He went under that ladder.
[42:40.310 --> 42:40.910]  That's not good.
[42:40.910 --> 42:44.960]  Uh-oh.
[42:45.940 --> 42:46.900]  Hold on!
[42:47.660 --> 42:49.020]  This is like the end of Twister.
[42:50.900 --> 42:52.560]  Wrap your belt. Wrap your belt.
[42:55.440 --> 42:56.180]  Uh-oh.
[42:56.240 --> 42:57.080]  Oh, no.
[42:59.260 --> 43:02.180]  He should have raised his eyebrows a couple of times like Bugs Bunny.
[43:02.680 --> 43:04.340]  Did the mouse break the fourth wall?
[43:04.900 --> 43:05.580]  He sure did.
[43:06.220 --> 43:06.700]  Uh-oh.
[43:06.700 --> 43:09.840]  Oh, yeah, he did.
[43:11.300 --> 43:13.220]  Two dead bodies and a load of shit.
[43:15.360 --> 43:16.500]  Oh, he said, God damn.
[43:21.350 --> 43:22.210]  What the fuck?
[43:28.010 --> 43:29.870]  Dude, that's going to be bad.
[43:30.350 --> 43:31.830]  What do they think they're sucking at this point?
[43:31.830 --> 43:31.890]  Oh, shit.
[43:38.210 --> 43:39.990]  It looks like a giant pumpkin.
[43:41.750 --> 43:43.310]  Oh, my God.
[44:20.540 --> 44:22.720]  This also looks like a jackass stunt.
[44:23.460 --> 44:23.680]  Yep.
[44:26.380 --> 44:30.920]  There's a real good chance none of us will ever be covered in that much feces at once.
[44:31.000 --> 44:31.680]  I hope.
[44:31.680 --> 44:32.820]  In our entire lives.
[44:33.180 --> 44:34.020]  Fingers crossed.
[44:34.500 --> 44:34.720]  Yeah.
[44:35.180 --> 44:37.800]  It looks like there's oats in it.
[44:38.660 --> 44:40.060]  Oh, yeah, I've been eating a lot of oats.
[44:40.940 --> 44:42.480]  Yeah, you assume it's all human feces.
[44:42.640 --> 44:44.280]  Yeah, a lot of horse stuff, you know?
[44:44.960 --> 44:45.240]  Nay.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.200]  Taking it away from her family.
[44:57.620 --> 44:58.320]  Oh, my God.
[44:58.600 --> 44:59.740]  Oh, my God.
[45:04.460 --> 45:04.860]  Jesus.
[45:07.900 --> 45:09.220]  Cool pound, though.
[45:09.640 --> 45:10.800]  That's a great pound.
[45:10.800 --> 45:13.280]  What year is this?
[45:14.100 --> 45:18.300]  Good Lord.
[45:29.540 --> 45:30.020]  Jesus!
[45:31.120 --> 45:32.120]  What the hell?
[45:32.340 --> 45:33.300]  Is that the incinerator?
[45:34.120 --> 45:34.600]  Oh, God.
[45:36.880 --> 45:39.900]  Oh, the guest, the cat.
[45:43.550 --> 45:44.650]  Oh, that guy.
[45:46.070 --> 45:46.810]  Maury?
[45:47.030 --> 45:47.370]  Maury.
[45:53.500 --> 45:56.080]  The cat is not the father.
[45:59.400 --> 46:01.200]  Has Povich done any movies?
[46:02.220 --> 46:03.680]  He must have.
[46:04.960 --> 46:07.540]  Not as, like, a lead, but I think as, like, himself.
[46:07.840 --> 46:09.060]  Definitely not as a lead.
[46:21.930 --> 46:23.050]  He has...
[46:25.050 --> 46:26.870]  played Maury Povich a lot.
[46:27.370 --> 46:27.550]  Yeah.
[46:30.770 --> 46:34.210]  They want a mentally ill, mean pussy.
[46:34.590 --> 46:38.230]  An old, mean, crazy cat.
[46:38.910 --> 46:40.070]  One that you can't love.
[46:40.410 --> 46:41.990]  It's chained in a box.
[46:42.270 --> 46:43.890]  They're gonna catzilla.
[46:49.170 --> 46:52.140]  Uh-oh.
[46:52.140 --> 47:00.140]  So they looked into it, and as far as props being sold for this movie, the only prop that has been sold is the animatronic head of this cat.
[47:00.440 --> 47:01.380]  Oh my God, really?
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.940]  How much did it sell for?
[47:05.320 --> 47:08.020]  It didn't say, but it was projected between $600 to $800.
[47:08.740 --> 47:09.360]  Oh, wow.
[47:09.360 --> 47:10.500]  That seems doable.
[47:11.900 --> 47:13.480]  Depending on what this cat looks like.
[47:13.820 --> 47:14.740]  I wanna buy the mouse.
[47:15.680 --> 47:17.800]  Did he just catleprod the cat?
[47:18.040 --> 47:18.440]  Yeah!
[47:18.840 --> 47:19.480]  That's catzilla.
[47:19.580 --> 47:20.920]  How else are you gonna stop catzilla?
[47:24.680 --> 47:25.580]  Mm-hmm.
[47:26.440 --> 47:27.400]  Oh, God.
[47:29.180 --> 47:32.120]  I really like that they're delaying showing what this cat looks like.
[47:32.180 --> 47:33.280]  I like that they're building this.
[47:34.240 --> 47:35.840]  Gavin, is this how you picked up Smee?
[47:37.940 --> 47:38.420]  Yes.
[47:45.090 --> 47:45.570]  Yeah!
[47:47.430 --> 47:48.850]  Oh my God.
[47:49.530 --> 47:50.010]  Wow.
[48:06.310 --> 48:09.310]  These guys are gonna end up with a gorilla real soon this way.
[48:10.450 --> 48:12.510]  That's how this works, man.
[48:13.810 --> 48:15.830]  Somebody has to stop this insane cat.
[48:16.570 --> 48:16.910]  Whoa.
[48:19.590 --> 48:20.950]  This little mouse.
[48:23.250 --> 48:24.610]  Go through the mouse holes.
[48:24.910 --> 48:25.210]  Oh.
[48:27.210 --> 48:29.370]  It's like Metal Gear Solid in the box.
[48:30.230 --> 48:31.630]  It works, it works.
[48:34.900 --> 48:35.620]  Whoa!
[48:38.200 --> 48:39.340]  800 bucks.
[48:39.560 --> 48:40.460]  Jesus Christ.
[48:43.360 --> 48:46.460]  That definitely seems worth it.
[48:53.480 --> 48:54.620]  Beautiful music.
[48:55.540 --> 48:57.440]  Wait, but the mouse didn't make any of them go down.
[48:58.540 --> 48:58.920]  Uh-oh.
[49:00.700 --> 49:01.180]  Yeah!
[49:02.040 --> 49:03.800]  Straight up a cartoon, isn't it?
[49:04.300 --> 49:04.840]  Great.
[49:06.640 --> 49:09.180]  Sort of a Tom and Jerry thing they got going on.
[49:16.070 --> 49:16.870]  1990s car.
[49:26.910 --> 49:27.830]  What? What?
[49:42.970 --> 49:44.190]  Why would you do that?
[49:47.740 --> 49:49.260]  They're gonna hang him with a string.
[49:54.200 --> 49:58.240]  I bet he's not even gonna give him free string to offset the disappointment.
[49:58.900 --> 50:03.160]  Oh, Jay says, including the buyer's premium, the cat head was sold for $3,700.
[50:03.780 --> 50:04.180]  Wow.
[50:04.560 --> 50:04.960]  Jesus.
[50:05.640 --> 50:05.760]  Wow.
[50:07.240 --> 50:08.320]  Too rich for my blood.
[50:09.180 --> 50:09.380]  Yeah.
[50:09.720 --> 50:10.380]  That's pretty rich.
[50:12.580 --> 50:15.160]  If I could have one whole mouse for that price, I'd do it.
[50:22.780 --> 50:24.300]  So this mouse is dead, right?
[50:24.540 --> 50:25.020]  In real life.
[50:25.020 --> 50:26.520]  Oh, big time.
[50:26.980 --> 50:30.860]  And it was an actor mouse, it was a performer mouse.
[50:31.120 --> 50:32.500]  It's an actor mouse, uh-huh.
[50:32.820 --> 50:38.160]  So it lived a life of mouse privilege and was elevated, probably.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.840]  Do you think the people that have the mice and the horses and the dogs that are actor mice, horses and dogs,
[50:47.240 --> 50:49.760]  do you think that they ever have them stuffed to remember them?
[50:49.980 --> 50:54.440]  Like if you went to some lady's house, is that mouse on her kitchen table?
[50:55.440 --> 50:56.980]  Like next to the salt and the pepper.
[50:57.560 --> 51:05.200]  It's probably like, I bet she puts it on top of her fridge with a bowl of cherries to remember it fondly.
[51:05.520 --> 51:06.260]  That would make sense.
[51:18.680 --> 51:21.540]  Yeah, a thousand percent Air Buds trainer had them stuffed, I agree with him.
[51:21.980 --> 51:22.780]  Oh, God.
[51:24.640 --> 51:27.640]  Maybe the dogs from Homeward Bound.
[51:28.680 --> 51:29.260]  Oh, jeez.
[51:33.870 --> 51:34.810]  Chance and Shadow.
[51:39.910 --> 51:41.050]  What was the cat code?
[51:42.470 --> 51:42.910]  Catzilla.
[51:46.350 --> 51:49.210]  Hang on, I want to see if we can remember it.
[51:50.130 --> 51:51.570]  Poor fucking cat.
[51:52.170 --> 51:53.290]  Was that a real cat?
[51:53.490 --> 51:54.470]  It has to be.
[51:54.830 --> 51:55.250]  Oh, my God.
[51:58.310 --> 51:59.770]  What was that cat's name?
[51:59.910 --> 52:03.470]  It was like Sissy Spacey something.
[52:04.330 --> 52:04.510]  Sally Field?
[52:04.830 --> 52:06.350]  Slappy Samsonite?
[52:07.810 --> 52:08.410]  Samsonite.
[52:12.640 --> 52:14.020]  Do you guys remember the movie Cat's Eye?
[52:14.020 --> 52:15.380]  That was a pretty cool cat.
[52:16.420 --> 52:16.860]  No.
[52:19.200 --> 52:19.640]  Sassy.
[52:20.220 --> 52:21.280]  Sassy, that was close.
[52:22.220 --> 52:23.720]  Oh, you'd like Cat's Eye, Andrew.
[52:24.020 --> 52:24.420]  Yeah?
[52:24.760 --> 52:27.420]  It was a horror compilation film by Stephen King.
[52:27.440 --> 52:27.980]  Oh, shit.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.720]  With like three stories that kind of intertwined all around a cat.
[52:31.280 --> 52:31.940]  Oh, that's awesome.
[52:32.240 --> 52:32.440]  Yeah.
[52:32.800 --> 52:33.400]  But be careful.
[52:33.860 --> 52:34.680]  James Woods in it.
[52:36.500 --> 52:37.100]  Oh, it meowed.
[52:37.200 --> 52:37.880]  It might still be there.
[52:38.060 --> 52:38.320]  Oh.
[52:39.820 --> 52:40.700]  What the...
[52:40.700 --> 52:41.520]  Hell, yeah.
[52:42.240 --> 52:42.660]  Uh-oh.
[52:42.660 --> 52:43.620]  Uh-oh.
[52:45.960 --> 52:47.340]  Mouse just killed the cat.
[52:50.220 --> 52:51.880]  The bloodlust knows no bounds.
[52:54.260 --> 52:56.120]  This was the inspiration for Men in Black.
[52:57.200 --> 52:58.240]  Dude, no kidding.
[53:06.060 --> 53:07.060]  Oh, yes.
[53:07.500 --> 53:14.740]  It seemed like it was a big reveal, like the way it was shot, and then it just didn't continue that way.
[53:15.080 --> 53:15.220]  Yeah.
[53:40.550 --> 53:41.130]  Oh, shit.
[53:45.330 --> 53:46.710]  That sounds good.
[53:49.430 --> 53:50.670]  I'm laughing.
[53:51.050 --> 53:52.650]  There are funny moments to this.
[54:01.640 --> 54:03.360]  He's gonna trick the mouse.
[54:12.750 --> 54:23.510]  How many times throughout his career before he became Christopher Walken, Christopher Walken, do you think he delivered a line and the director goes, uh...
[54:25.390 --> 54:27.430]  Could we try to deliver it this way?
[54:27.550 --> 54:30.390]  And Walken's like, I think we'll deliver it my way.
[54:30.830 --> 54:33.390]  He just goes, what do you mean?
[54:34.190 --> 54:36.550]  No, that's how I said it.
[55:03.170 --> 55:05.430]  This is so crazy.
[55:07.090 --> 55:12.210]  I feel like all of these type of movies that have an exterminator need this exterminator.
[55:12.650 --> 55:12.870]  Yeah.
[55:12.990 --> 55:16.150]  I can't tell if I'm watching Mouse Hunter or the Deer Hunter right now.
[55:47.490 --> 55:50.030]  I love it. I love it. I want that.
[55:51.250 --> 55:52.290]  We should put that on his shirt.
[55:53.750 --> 55:55.030]  You are the intruder.
[55:55.450 --> 56:01.730]  The first union was formed here.
[56:03.310 --> 56:04.970]  In 1990. Right.
[56:05.550 --> 56:05.810]  Right.
[56:07.750 --> 56:08.790]  Or 1945.
[56:09.050 --> 56:09.590]  Yeah, right.
[56:11.290 --> 56:15.530]  Man, Walken's headgear would be the ultimate prop, I think.
[56:15.710 --> 56:17.470]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[56:22.750 --> 56:25.610]  Now he's going to make a string on his own.
[56:30.300 --> 56:31.580]  Boy, what are the odds of that?
[56:35.940 --> 56:37.440]  Pretty good according to this script.
[56:41.520 --> 56:44.300]  How many buttons do you think it takes to turn on a cruise ship?
[56:45.160 --> 56:46.160]  Oh my god.
[56:48.020 --> 56:50.680]  I'm going to say three keys and six buttons.
[56:51.140 --> 56:52.280]  Like an aircraft carrier.
[56:53.300 --> 56:54.820]  Do you think there is a key?
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.180]  Like, do you think it's just a regular key?
[56:57.960 --> 56:59.800]  I think there are like two keys.
[57:00.580 --> 57:04.780]  And if you lose it, you can't drive the super yacht anymore.
[57:05.800 --> 57:07.500]  The carnival cruise ship anymore.
[57:08.620 --> 57:10.720]  Everybody look on the ground. It's around here somewhere.
[57:12.320 --> 57:13.960]  We can still make Porta Vallarta.
[57:14.900 --> 57:17.140]  The key to the cruise ship is so crazy.
[57:21.500 --> 57:21.940]  No!
[57:25.620 --> 57:27.800]  I do not understand the physics of that.
[57:29.340 --> 57:31.980]  So the mouse is doing this?
[57:32.600 --> 57:33.600]  No, he's just an idiot.
[57:34.080 --> 57:35.140]  Yeah, he just has bad luck.
[57:35.220 --> 57:36.340]  He's not with the mouse right now.
[57:36.700 --> 57:39.200]  I can't have sympathy for these guys.
[57:40.020 --> 57:41.440]  These are idiot men.
[57:41.560 --> 57:42.340]  I'm for the mouse.
[57:42.440 --> 57:44.580]  I hope the mouse kills these men cat style.
[57:44.580 --> 57:45.500]  Yeah!
[57:48.320 --> 57:52.020]  This is like if the wet bandits were bad at their job all the time.
[57:52.340 --> 57:54.260]  Oh no! He'll be killed!
[57:54.620 --> 57:57.920]  This is the kind of stuff that would legitimately kill...
[57:57.920 --> 57:59.360]  Oh! It's so bad!
[58:03.160 --> 58:05.600]  Yes! That's what we need.
[58:06.040 --> 58:07.560]  What is he like, ultrasounding the floor?
[58:11.720 --> 58:14.000]  I remember this very vividly.
[58:15.740 --> 58:17.920]  This was like early ASMR for me.
[58:20.060 --> 58:20.760]  In a bad way?
[58:21.360 --> 58:24.740]  What was that? The Nintendo console where it was all red?
[58:24.800 --> 58:25.400]  Is that what he's doing?
[58:26.300 --> 58:27.580]  Yeah, he's doing the virtual boy.
[58:29.780 --> 58:32.600]  God, that thing was terrible.
[58:38.880 --> 58:39.420]  Oh boy.
[58:47.390 --> 58:51.530]  There's something really special about having such a goofy script...
[58:51.530 --> 58:56.210]  And then giving it to a director that has such clear, thoughtful vision.
[58:56.510 --> 58:57.910]  As far as what it should look like.
[58:58.550 --> 59:00.250]  It adds so much to it.
[59:04.630 --> 59:05.670]  That's movies!
[59:06.410 --> 59:09.450]  What you're describing is that's what all movies should be.
[59:09.690 --> 59:11.490]  The director should have a clear vision.
[59:12.870 --> 59:17.350]  Whether it is a big goofy thing or a small, quiet picture.
[59:17.770 --> 59:19.650]  I think both are really strong.
[59:19.650 --> 59:23.590]  And Gore Verbinski is just a guy who's like, taking big cartoon swings.
[59:23.810 --> 59:25.970]  And I think it's awesome. I love it.
[59:26.070 --> 59:27.830]  There isn't stuff that is like this.
[59:30.290 --> 59:32.550]  This is a blast. Why did he make Lone Ranger?
[59:36.690 --> 59:38.090]  Like, why did he do that?
[59:38.290 --> 59:40.190]  Why did he make Lone Ranger? That's such a bummer.
[59:40.910 --> 59:41.830]  Could have made Mouse Hunt 2.
[59:42.290 --> 59:43.010]  That's what I'm saying.
[59:49.360 --> 59:49.660]  Huh.
[59:52.240 --> 59:53.240]  What's happening here?
[59:53.320 --> 59:54.020]  Well, hello.
[59:57.780 --> 59:58.360]  Okay.
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.960]  Hi, ladies. I own a string factory and I killed the mayor.
[01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.280]  My current enemy is a mouse.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.020]  About to sell it out from under my brother.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.660]  Do I smell like shit?
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.940]  Do I smell like shit?
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.380]  I was covered in shit.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.420]  Did you see him on that phone over there, ladies?
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.420]  Oh, dear.
[01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.880]  You told me the mouse is doing this?
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.980]  Is that Mario Cantone?
[01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:31.960]  Yes.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.000]  From Sex and the City?
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.360]  Didn't remember that.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.160]  This is just such a big cartoon. It's so much fun.
[01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.220]  Walder Frey?
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.540]  Is that his outfit?
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.200]  My wife.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.180]  Good lord.
[01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:49.000]  His dad can't believe it.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.200]  Watch his son bone down.
[01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:57.250]  Do you remember the first movie you saw that had nudity in it?
[01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:01.690]  Titanic had a tit in it.
[01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.070]  Yeah.
[01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:05.510]  That's not stuff before that. I just don't remember what it is.
[01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:07.090]  Probably Porky's.
[01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:09.490]  Porky's is a good one.
[01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:10.650]  Oh, Animal House.
[01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:11.150]  Yeah.
[01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:19.530]  Remember going to a friend's house for his birthday and his stepdad rented Porky's and he's like, don't tell your mom.
[01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:21.210]  I like those rods.
[01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:26.770]  We should never watch that film.
[01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.410]  No, we should absolutely never watch Porky's.
[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:29.690]  No.
[01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.590]  I imagine it doesn't hold up.
[01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:32.310]  No.
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.030]  It wasn't holding up then.
[01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:37.150]  Everything held up then.
[01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:37.890]  Yep.
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.110]  Geoff, did you see that Topps released a Robert Oppenheimer autograph card?
[01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:45.650]  No, I did not.
[01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:48.050]  Did they really?
[01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:49.370]  Breaking.
[01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:52.170]  Robert Oppenheimer's first ever autograph card is here.
[01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:54.530]  A very difficult signature to find.
[01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.330]  What?
[01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:57.970]  This is crazy.
[01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:00.450]  In the 2024 Transcendent set.
[01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:01.850]  So, be on the lookout.
[01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:03.450]  I don't collect Transcendent.
[01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:05.090]  Good to know.
[01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:05.930]  Uh oh.
[01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:08.890]  Oh my god, the mouse is evil?
[01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.010]  No, he's just clever.
[01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:13.990]  This is awesome.
[01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.190]  This is so...
[01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.030]  This is so cool.
[01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:30.230]  The mouse is going to kill this guy.
[01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:31.230]  Oh my god.
[01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:33.090]  Such a cartoon.
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.510]  He's already dead.
[01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.850]  I wonder if that sucked, filming that.
[01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:38.470]  Oh.
[01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:40.930]  It's so cool.
[01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.470]  It's such, it's so cool.
[01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:43.850]  Practical set.
[01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.710]  He doesn't even look like Christopher Walken there.
[01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:00.810]  He took a shit on him.
[01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:06.290]  That's a long walk back for that mouse too.
[01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:08.090]  That's a really good point.
[01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:09.250]  He's got tiny little legs.
[01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:18.770]  They knew about concussions back then?
[01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:20.630]  Yeah, but they kept them secret.
[01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:22.750]  This isn't the NFL.
[01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:25.830]  Back then in 1905.
[01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.910]  Belgian hair models, I've heard of that scene.
[01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:46.750]  Does he have life insurance?
[01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:56.110]  Just...
[01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:05.350]  The timing on so many of these things are so funny.
[01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.870]  He's just wearing the little hat.
[01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:07.490]  It's great.
[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:22.940]  What the fuck does that mean?
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:23.520]  What the hell?
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.840]  What the hell?
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.020]  Uh oh.
[01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.250]  Oh no.
[01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:52.030]  Uh oh.
[01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.710]  What happened to Caesar?
[01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:55.770]  Who the fuck is Caesar?
[01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:57.990]  Oh, Christopher Walken.
[01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:59.790]  It's that body over there.
[01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:21.790]  It's like a scene from Apocalypse Now.
[01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:23.590]  He never phones it in.
[01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:23.970]  No.
[01:06:26.610 --> 01:06:27.610]  They're everywhere.
[01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:28.970]  He's screaming in the background.
[01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:31.870]  He's locked in a trunk in the attic.
[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:36.950]  How did he get him back in the attic?
[01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.250]  How did he get all the way back up there?
[01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:24.130]  Mouse just wanted to sleep peacefully.
[01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.010]  A little bed.
[01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:34.850]  And he ate all the peanut butter.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.160]  Did he say arugula?
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:11.580]  Why?
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:12.520]  These idiots.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.180]  They didn't want to crush the sandwich.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.500]  Crush him into the sandwich.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:23.900]  It would hurt so much to get hit with a frying pan like that.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:24.280]  Yeah.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.460]  It would be the worst.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:26.360]  A cast iron?
[01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.590]  Jessica in the chat said this mouse is a chef.
[01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:37.830]  Yeah, the movie poster for this is the mouse as a chef.
[01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.210]  He's got a little hat on and everything.
[01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.830]  Yeah.
[01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:43.970]  We call him the original Ratatouille.
[01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:45.870]  One of the first chef mice.
[01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:47.770]  Oh my god, he went all the way up there?
[01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:48.770]  He's a pioneer, honestly.
[01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:51.410]  One of the first chef mice.
[01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:53.070]  He looks like Leatherface.
[01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:54.210]  He's breaking ground here.
[01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:57.230]  It's at this moment in which I have to say,
[01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.450]  Gavin, you're right, this is the third best Home Alone movie.
[01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:01.470]  I totally agree.
[01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.450]  Such good little set pieces.
[01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:04.430]  It's really fun.
[01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.130]  This mouse is full Kevin McAllister at this point.
[01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:09.710]  And it's great.
[01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:11.470]  He's going for the gas hole.
[01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:13.810]  I just don't get why you don't like
[01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:14.810]  Home Alone 1 and 2.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:22.920]  Oh god.
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.180]  Oh fuck.
[01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:27.800]  This is just straight up
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.580]  going for death.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.120]  Does he get blown out?
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.860]  Does he get blown out the top?
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.180]  Oh yeah!
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:58.060]  He lit the beam!
[01:09:58.620 --> 01:09:58.840]  Oh my god.
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:00.220]  Does he ever get blown out?
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.440]  Holy shit!
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:03.900]  Oh my god, the beacons are lit.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.180]  Gondor calls for aid.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.060]  In the bathtub!
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.360]  Sacramento wins!
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.140]  Jesus Christ, dude.
[01:10:13.290 --> 01:10:15.170]  I think this is the bit where the
[01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.710]  cabinet falls on his fingers.
[01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.050]  I remember this.
[01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:23.830]  Wow, he looks...
[01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:26.010]  He looks like Christopher Walken.
[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.430]  Ah!
[01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:28.010]  Ah!
[01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:36.110]  Oh, he has a wedding ring on too.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.400]  I think Mouse Hunt should have won
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:56.860]  an Oscar.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.400]  Are we sure it didn't?
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:00.940]  Let me look.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:11.460]  A shotgun?
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.560]  What the fuck have they been doing
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.280]  this whole time?
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:15.120]  Not shooting the mouse.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:18.760]  Straight up
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.600]  going for the guns.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.300]  It was nominated for
[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.640]  a Saturn Award, Best Fantasy Film,
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.360]  and a
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.340]  Key Art Award, Best of Show
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.500]  Audiovisual, and a Kids' Choice Award,
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:32.300]  and it was for a Blimp Award, Favorite
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.080]  Animal Star, but it was simply a nominee.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.440]  I wonder what
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.060]  beat it out.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.500]  Let me look.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.380]  I heard the favorite kid's quote from this film was,
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.500]  She Took Me.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.280]  We did it only in a way of seeing a nature show.
[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:50.300]  Kids' Choice
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.080]  Awards.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:53.560]  Favorite
[01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:55.700]  Animal Star.
[01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.380]  It's probably Earbud, right?
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.880]  Isn't this the end of the first level in Ratatouille?
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.560]  It sort of is, yeah.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.900]  Salem the Cat from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:06.920]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.000]  Hard to compete with that.
[01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.520]  Smart-ass cat.
[01:12:13.190 --> 01:12:14.650]  I gotta see who the nominees
[01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:15.810]  were, though. Let me see.
[01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:19.970]  Buddy from Earbud,
[01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:21.490]  Mouse from Mouse Hunt,
[01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:23.550]  Willy from Free Willy 3 The Rescue.
[01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:25.230]  Oh, really?
[01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.470]  Dude,
[01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:29.650]  Andrew,
[01:12:29.970 --> 01:12:31.530]  Favorite Video Game
[01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:34.390]  from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards
[01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.390]  1998. Star Fox
[01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:37.090]  64.
[01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.170]  Diddy's
[01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:42.450]  Kong Quest, Super Mario
[01:12:42.450 --> 01:12:44.390]  64, Super Mario
[01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:46.470]  World 2 Yoshi's Island. Which one of those
[01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:47.010]  do you think won?
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.210]  Diddy's Kong Quest?
[01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.050]  Super Mario 64.
[01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:54.390]  How are they all Nintendo games?
[01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.730]  Oh my god!
[01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:00.230]  What the fuck
[01:13:00.230 --> 01:13:01.190]  just happened?
[01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:02.870]  He shot the bug bomb.
[01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:05.090]  Oh, the bug bomb!
[01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:06.730]  See, that's some Home Alone shit.
[01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.970]  That's Home Alone 2.
[01:13:08.190 --> 01:13:10.370]  That was Plan G.
[01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:12.750]  That was Plan G.
[01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:15.110]  That's pretty good, man.
[01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:17.190]  That stunt was wicked.
[01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:17.950]  Yeah.
[01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:39.690]  Mr. Smuntz, this is
[01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:41.750]  Vinny from Zeppo. Jesus
[01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.410]  Christ.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:13:59.960]  And now
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.340]  the Mafia's gonna kill us.
[01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:14.750]  He sounds like the guy
[01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:16.890]  from Condor Band
[01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:17.670]  when he's in
[01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.730]  Helladolly.
[01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.730]  Man, that movie was so enjoyable.
[01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:26.390]  It's fucking classic, man. Aside from
[01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:28.170]  3 or 4 minutes of it that we don't talk about yet.
[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:34.770]  When he falls off
[01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:35.310]  the
[01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:37.610]  ski lift
[01:14:37.610 --> 01:14:38.030]  or whatever.
[01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:41.190]  That's the funniest bit in the whole movie.
[01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:43.550]  Fucking cinematic
[01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.950]  art.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.020]  How much for the rights to Condor Man be?
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.780]  Probably a lot.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.880]  Who owns the rights to Condor Man?
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.200]  Disney?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.300]  Yeah, it was Disney.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.960]  It was a Disney movie.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.440]  Shit, we'll never get it.
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.920]  They put Condor Man in one of the Toy Story shorts
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.400]  one time.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.940]  Paramount Global owns
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.060]  the rights to Condor Man.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.980]  I actually saw that short the other day, Geoff.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:19.420]  Oh, really?
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.920]  I've never seen it, I just always see it referenced.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:23.760]  Is it good?
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:25.540]  It's pretty funny.
[01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:28.880]  I think I like some of the Toy Story shorts more than
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.580]  at least the first two movies.
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.360]  Animation looks great.
[01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:41.410]  These guys had to spend a lot of this movie
[01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:41.810]  dirty.
[01:15:42.290 --> 01:15:43.430]  Yeah, it sucks.
[01:15:44.210 --> 01:15:46.210]  Long days when you're covered in
[01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:48.030]  feces and mud.
[01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:49.570]  It'd be interesting to know the sequence
[01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:51.170]  in which they filmed this.
[01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:52.510]  Oh yeah, that would be interesting.
[01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:53.890]  It starts with this.
[01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.590]  That would be funny if you could watch
[01:15:57.590 --> 01:16:00.070]  a pop-up video version of a movie
[01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:01.850]  where every time it cuts to a new shot
[01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:03.650]  it tells you what day it was shot on.
[01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:04.890]  Oh no!
[01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:06.770]  No, the mouse!
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.240]  You're down.
[01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:22.770]  Well, get him out!
[01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:24.390]  Just scoop him up and throw him outside!
[01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:25.830]  Smash him against a wall!
[01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.850]  Smash him against a wall!
[01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:31.190]  I couldn't do it.
[01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.470]  If a mouse was like that, I couldn't kill it.
[01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:35.410]  No, I couldn't do it either.
[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:36.870]  I'd feel it too much.
[01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:37.870]  I'd feel the squelch.
[01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:40.950]  I tried to kill a bug at the 100%
[01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:42.330]  eat office the other day
[01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:44.330]  and Jordan made me scoop it up and put it
[01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:45.990]  outside in the fucking snow.
[01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:48.290]  You think it's better?
[01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:49.410]  What is this?
[01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:50.590]  Just get it out.
[01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:52.310]  It's ridiculous.
[01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.250]  Just buy a ticket to Hawaii!
[01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:59.310]  I can't kill it.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.580]  He tried to light you on fire.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:06.920]  He used you as a bullet.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.340]  Look at your face.
[01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.040]  To Fidel Castro?
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:12.600]  Wait.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.700]  It's not sporting
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.980]  but he didn't put holes in the...
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:23.480]  Kill him slow, baby.
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.020]  Suffocation is on the table.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.460]  Is it a felony to mail an animal in a box?
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.420]  Gotta be.
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:32.940]  I think you have to declare it.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.600]  There's a mouse in here.
[01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.500]  I declare this is mice.
[01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:42.980]  Mice.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:43.900]  Surely
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.340]  you can't mail to Cuba.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.780]  Well, we don't know
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.900]  when this took place.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.120]  It's true.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:54.980]  Fair point.
[01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:00.610]  News radio.
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.880]  I still have those.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.240]  Yeah, the mail trucks?
[01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:14.820]  Yeah.
[01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:14.920]  Yeah.
[01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:20.190]  That was taken from GoldenEye.
[01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:21.310]  What?
[01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:23.630]  It's gonna
[01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:25.290]  actually reach Castro?
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:30.060]  Insufficient postage.
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:34.630]  Yes!
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.980]  But what if one mouse lived in it?
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:49.400]  They got their stairs fixed
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.180]  real fast.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.120]  Bolted up that hole.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.920]  Is this the same
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.680]  fucking house?
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.000]  Look at the walls.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.700]  They don't have the money to pay their employees
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.140]  but they have tuxedos and they did all that
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:02.940]  carpentry work.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:06.220]  Yeah, but it's because one mouse doesn't live there now, Geoff.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.280]  And the woman
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.860]  helped pay for everything.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.460]  All is forgiven and settled.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.680]  And they boned like a nature documentary.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.220]  I wonder if they still talk.
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.700]  Yeah, but he'd be proud of it.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.920]  Yeah, but only about the mouse.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.040]  Lee Evans is gonna be like
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:38.880]  60 now.
[01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:41.780]  How old do you think Nathan Lane is?
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:44.960]  Older than that.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:53.680]  Do you think they went to the mouse's funeral when it died?
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.280]  I don't think the mouse had a funeral, probably.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.660]  They just stuffed it immediately
[01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.460]  and threw it away.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.560]  I was thinking more like how
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.700]  Alan Cumming has stayed in the life of that
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.020]  monkey he worked with that time.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.460]  Geoff desperately wants this mouse to be alive.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.220]  You know, wishful thinking.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.340]  Good lord.
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.960]  That's a lot of maraschino cherries.
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:23.880]  It'd be awesome if cherries came like that from nature.
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.040]  Are they real cherries, those fricking things?
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:29.160]  Yeah, they're like candy somehow.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.200]  They're just like soaked in sugar
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.140]  water or something.
[01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:36.330]  What do you think a
[01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:37.950]  shape tastes like with that?
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.370]  Guys, find out next week.
[01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.170]  Oh, man.
[01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:46.640]  I've never...
[01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:48.350]  I've never not
[01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:49.750]  enjoyed fruit that much before.
[01:20:51.330 --> 01:20:54.330]  The sum of their parts
[01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:55.310]  was not greater
[01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:57.350]  than the individual.
[01:20:58.050 --> 01:20:59.310]  The next regulation podcast
[01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:00.350]  is pretty fruit heavy.
[01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:00.950]  Yeah.
[01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.610]  So these guys got back together
[01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.010]  to make... they were in The Producers
[01:21:07.010 --> 01:21:08.310]  together in 2004.
[01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:10.410]  It looks like.
[01:21:10.730 --> 01:21:11.950]  Oh, Lee Evans was in that?
[01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:14.090]  Yeah, it's Lee Evans and Nathan Lane.
[01:21:14.850 --> 01:21:16.930]  But it's not the movie. I think it's just
[01:21:16.930 --> 01:21:18.050]  the play.
[01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.210]  It looks like it's just for stage
[01:21:23.210 --> 01:21:25.130]  which is a lot of fun, but I think that's
[01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:27.250]  really cool that these guys got together like seven years
[01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.110]  later. Like, hey, remember that mouse? Yeah,
[01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.110]  anyway, now we're in The Producers.
[01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:33.210]  But Nathan Lane was in The Producers
[01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:34.890]  the film too, right? Yes.
[01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:36.730]  He was with Patrick Broderick.
[01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:39.150]  I highly
[01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.890]  recommend watching... Did he just say
[01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:41.610]  Hakuna Matata?
[01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:44.530]  Hakuna Matata!
[01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:45.390]  Whoa.
[01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:49.270]  I get it. I get the reference. What a wonderful
[01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:51.050]  phrase. Oquan Tanzanon.
[01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:53.090]  My kid watched
[01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:54.610]  The Lion King for the first time.
[01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:56.870]  Oh, really? Where's his dad?
[01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.130]  Oh, God. Well, just show him
[01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:01.230]  Mufasa, the prequel that I've never heard of.
[01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.710]  Yeah.
[01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:05.170]  I'm not showing him the live
[01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.450]  action. All that stuff sucks.
[01:22:08.050 --> 01:22:09.110]  Every live action
[01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:10.950]  Disney movie is trash. Except for Cinderella.
[01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:16.930]  Oh, what's that guy from?
[01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:17.590]  Mr. Pitt!
[01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:19.490]  From Seinfeld.
[01:22:19.690 --> 01:22:21.910]  They got the old people on lockdown in this movie.
[01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.190]  Yeah.
[01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:25.870]  Why would he bring it in the house?
[01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:28.430]  Why would he bring it in the house?
[01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:29.250]  No!
[01:22:30.250 --> 01:22:31.550]  The mouse already came out.
[01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:33.530]  Yeah, it'll chew through the box. It's an empty hole.
[01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:34.210]  He's ready.
[01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:39.590]  Yeah, all of Lee Evans' stand-up,
[01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:41.410]  he starts sweating like three minutes in,
[01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:43.770]  and it's just soaked all the way through.
[01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:45.310]  That's incredible.
[01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.510]  He has towels and stuff.
[01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:51.210]  Robin Williams was like that, too.
[01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:52.030]  Oh, really?
[01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.870]  Yeah. Soaked.
[01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.570]  Have you noticed Gavin in the background?
[01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:59.570]  Oh, not Gavin, sorry. The other one, Andrew.
[01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:01.090]  The other one!
[01:23:01.650 --> 01:23:03.470]  In the background of the episodes
[01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:05.430]  of The Traitors, Tom Sandoval is always
[01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:06.750]  sweating through all of his clothes.
[01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:09.310]  Supposedly, he was detoxing
[01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:11.150]  because he couldn't bring all of his
[01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:13.290]  whatever-it-is-he-takes with him.
[01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:15.810]  Yeah, that's how he was just like a mess the whole time.
[01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.890]  Allegedly.
[01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.590]  They only cut to him to make him look like an ass.
[01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:24.030]  Or I guess not look, but just show how much of an ass he is.
[01:23:24.090 --> 01:23:25.430]  I mean, that's the point of him being there, right?
[01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:26.190]  Yes, it is.
[01:23:26.490 --> 01:23:27.690]  He's gotta know that.
[01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:31.010]  At some point,
[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:32.850]  he must.
[01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:35.210]  I was texting with you guys the other day,
[01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:37.430]  but I think I'm gonna
[01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:39.110]  watch this Taskmaster show.
[01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:41.110]  Yeah, I'm excited for you to watch it.
[01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:42.730]  The String!
[01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:45.110]  I just watched a couple episodes the other day for fun.
[01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:45.690]  It's a good show.
[01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:47.950]  I think my favorite series is Seven.
[01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.230]  James A. Caster and
[01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:52.170]  Grant Gilbert.
[01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:55.030]  Do it, you pussy!
[01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:58.950]  I guess the new one comes out soon. Jason Manzoukas
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.030]  is in it, and I really like him.
[01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:03.110]  Is it like a US version of it, or is he
[01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:04.010]  in the British version?
[01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:05.190]  I have no idea.
[01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:09.230]  They tried to do an American one
[01:24:09.230 --> 01:24:11.350]  where Alex Horne was still the assistant,
[01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:13.150]  but they had Reggie Watts
[01:24:13.150 --> 01:24:13.690]  as the Taskmaster.
[01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:17.270]  Alex said they had dogshit
[01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:18.470]  chemistry and it didn't work.
[01:24:18.610 --> 01:24:21.210]  It didn't work, but also Comedy Central
[01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:23.070]  was like, it has to be 30 minutes.
[01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:25.090]  I don't understand
[01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.270]  buying a format from another
[01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:28.670]  country and then just changing the format.
[01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.110]  I think when you're an executive, you just kinda
[01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.950]  like go, here are my notes, and they go,
[01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:35.410]  well, these don't work, and they go, right, but these are my notes.
[01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:36.930]  You gotta take them and use them.
[01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:39.030]  How else am I gonna justify my paycheck, idiot?
[01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:39.950]  And then you disappear.
[01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:42.990]  There's a bunch of other countries' versions, like there's some European ones
[01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:44.830]  and New Zealand one, and they're all like the
[01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:45.570]  original format.
[01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:48.190]  I hear they're good too.
[01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:50.990]  The friend who introduced me to
[01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:53.150]  that show loves the other series
[01:24:53.810 --> 01:24:54.650]  versions as well.
[01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:55.930]  Except for the US, he says it sucks.
[01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:58.910]  Is that the friend who has your
[01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:59.630]  copy of Left 4 Dead?
[01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.110]  No.
[01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:04.170]  We lost touch, sadly.
[01:25:04.170 --> 01:25:04.970]  Just trying to keep straight.
[01:25:06.230 --> 01:25:07.430]  Different friend, got it.
[01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.370]  Different friend.
[01:25:10.410 --> 01:25:11.910]  So how can I watch it?
[01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:13.750]  Do I just have to download it or something?
[01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.250]  Oh, is it?
[01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.870]  I'm not gonna watch old ones, I'm just gonna watch this one.
[01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.750]  That's all I wanna watch.
[01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:21.670]  I think it's probably on a streaming server somewhere,
[01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:23.030]  because I watched it not too long ago.
[01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:26.210]  I just found it randomly browsing, maybe Amazon or something.
[01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:27.470]  Okay, cool.
[01:25:27.630 --> 01:25:28.570]  Oh, they might be on Amazon.
[01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:31.350]  I know they have everything on YouTube so far.
[01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:33.910]  It varies a lot, like some tasks are very okay
[01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:35.090]  and some are just...
[01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:36.490]  you would never come up with them yourself.
[01:25:36.650 --> 01:25:38.250]  And they go off the rails.
[01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:41.530]  There are a lot of base hits
[01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:43.350]  on that show, but it can hit some
[01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:44.390]  really good highs.
[01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:47.670]  This is how I felt
[01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:49.230]  at every prop auction that we've done.
[01:25:49.810 --> 01:25:50.450]  Just so you guys know.
[01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:51.970]  You're the cowboy?
[01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:53.250]  The mouse!
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.040]  Why did he bring him inside?
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.800]  He didn't!
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.620]  He was in already, Eric.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.780]  I don't believe it.
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.220]  The woman said these raisins are lovely.
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.440]  And she's eating rat turds.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.760]  This mouse...
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.060]  This mouse tricked me.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.780]  I was watching
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.940]  The Sting! That's who had mustaches
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:17.620]  like that.
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:20.340]  I saw it for one second,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.020]  and it made me think of guys with mustaches.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.120]  The Sting is a good movie.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.240]  It's a great movie.
[01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:28.480]  It's probably the best of all the movies
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.540]  I had to watch in college.
[01:26:31.860 --> 01:26:32.260]  Whoa!
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:33.780]  Holy shit!
[01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.460]  You can't get away with that in 2025,
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:37.140]  buddy.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.020]  I don't think you can get away with it in 1987, dude.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.580]  In 1987, you could have done it.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.460]  Oh no, not in front of your wife, either.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.460]  News radio.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.240]  Oh, and she's into it.
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.140]  He's having a rummage.
[01:27:15.190 --> 01:27:16.310]  Oh no!
[01:27:18.810 --> 01:27:20.370]  Put your arm down, you moron!
[01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:28.310]  Is this stand-up this physical, Gavin?
[01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:29.650]  Oh, he's all over the place.
[01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:32.610]  He probably runs like a marathon on stage.
[01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:35.430]  It's absolutely insane, his stand-up.
[01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:37.210]  Oh, this is...
[01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:43.410]  Yeah, so this is just like every prop auction
[01:27:43.410 --> 01:27:44.150]  that I've been part of.
[01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.910]  I'm gonna get it out.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.100]  He looks like a monkey.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.000]  This is crazy.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  Was that guy also in Seinfeld?
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.820]  Nope, that's... nope.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.980]  Oh no, another one!
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:18.920]  No, he's got another!
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.680]  So much is happening!
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.660]  A fire!
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:29.140]  You're telling me the mouse did this?
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:29.600]  Save him!
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:31.360]  He's the cause.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.760]  The catalyst, if you will.
[01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:38.000]  Is he still bidding while choking?
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:38.520]  Yep.
[01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:46.910]  He's laughing at her!
[01:28:47.170 --> 01:28:48.190]  He's laughing at her!
[01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:49.530]  You're gonna die!
[01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:56.890]  $16 million!
[01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:03.970]  This is the craziest auction I've ever seen.
[01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:06.130]  The buyer's premium will be insane!
[01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.710]  This may not have had a premium.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.920]  They redid the whole house
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.080]  but left the mouse holes.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.720]  You can screw it back on, moron!
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.860]  I bet this is the kind of shit
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.140]  that went on in my old house
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.160]  right before I bought it.
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.720]  Yeah, they covered the mouse holes, though.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:52.440]  Swim!
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:56.520]  $20 million!
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.860]  Good lord!
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.860]  Sign it now, quick!
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.980]  What do they think is currently happening?
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:11.380]  Who's they?
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.940]  The guys. They've left the water running
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:16.420]  with the thing in the...
[01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:17.960]  Like, they just don't seem to care.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:19.640]  Like, they know that the water's still going.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:22.220]  Oh yeah, they're distracted by all the money.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.060]  That's a lot of water for the space
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:24.660]  of one auction.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.240]  Especially from one garden hose.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:30.920]  $22 million is my last offer.
[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:34.680]  How much do you think it's worth today?
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:37.060]  About the same.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:41.060]  I feel like at $22 million,
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.300]  you wouldn't skip $3 million.
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:44.160]  You'd still edge it up a little.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:44.680]  Yeah.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:47.640]  Especially since he said,
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.660]  that's my last offer.
[01:30:48.740 --> 01:30:50.760]  And he's like, fuck you! $3 million more!
[01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:57.650]  Oh no!
[01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:58.210]  No!
[01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:04.870]  Lane's looking at it like a flower,
[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:05.910]  twisting it around.
[01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:09.270]  Gavel, gavel!
[01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:10.230]  Oh no!
[01:31:10.230 --> 01:31:10.450]  No!
[01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:12.010]  It's not official.
[01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:14.750]  That's going to lower the price.
[01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:17.130]  Now they have to live here with the mouse, probably.
[01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:20.650]  That must have been so fun.
[01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.590]  Oh man.
[01:31:21.610 --> 01:31:23.710]  Actually, it was a night in the cold. I bet that was miserable.
[01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:24.970]  Oh, it'd be so cold.
[01:31:26.430 --> 01:31:28.610]  It's not 7pm there.
[01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:30.230]  It is 3.30am.
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.340]  And you know,
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.280]  they filmed so much they didn't use.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:37.760]  Uh huh.
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.320]  They wanted to make sure
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.400]  they had plenty of coverage so they didn't have to do that
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:44.120]  setup again.
[01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.380]  How much did this movie make?
[01:31:48.060 --> 01:31:48.760]  Look it up.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:50.080]  Mouse hunt.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.500]  I bet Lee Evans' stand-up tour made more than this movie.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:55.340]  Probably.
[01:31:56.940 --> 01:31:58.220]  Worldwide box office.
[01:32:00.420 --> 01:32:01.460]  $122 million.
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.060]  Damn.
[01:32:03.740 --> 01:32:05.460]  Made $61 million
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:07.440]  in the US, $60 million international.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:08.280]  Alright.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:10.320]  How much did it cost to make?
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.640]  $300,000 probably.
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:16.240]  $38 million.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:16.880]  Jesus.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.880]  That's a huge success.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:19.780]  Yeah, no kidding.
[01:32:20.140 --> 01:32:21.220]  I'm surprised we didn't get a sequel.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:23.360]  I mean, in the US it doubled its budget.
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:27.080]  This is before anybody cared about international.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:27.880]  Yeah.
[01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.060]  Oh, Flubber was $80 million.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.380]  Before anyone cared about international.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:34.400]  Laughing.
[01:32:40.570 --> 01:32:41.930]  Oh, the string!
[01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:43.130]  Oh, he coughed it up.
[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:44.750]  Lucky string.
[01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:47.010]  So the rat threw up the string?
[01:32:51.170 --> 01:32:52.490]  It's over, he's dead.
[01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:53.650]  Laughing.
[01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:03.390]  What's the life lesson they're going to take from this?
[01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.310]  There was never a rat to begin with.
[01:33:05.550 --> 01:33:06.270]  They were the rat.
[01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:10.350]  Don't kill the mayor.
[01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.430]  Don't kill the mayor.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.480]  Continuity on their outfits and faces must have been a nightmare.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.640]  Oh, it's too lucky string.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.440]  So they don't have anything?
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.100]  They still got the factory.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.960]  Where does the mouse live?
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:31.280]  Guys, they have each other.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.700]  That's all that really matters.
[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:33.660]  And the string.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.460]  The mouse's house is gone.
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.600]  Is the mouse under the car?
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.080]  I hope he has a little mouse suitcase.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:42.380]  It's like Cape Fear!
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:42.780]  Yeah!
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.720]  It's Cape Fear!
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.240]  And a little Robert De Niro mouse.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.300]  Max Cady'd his ass, holy shit!
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.580]  He's going to start laughing loudly in the movie theater behind them.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:58.060]  Smoking a cigar.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:33:59.600]  Wow!
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.020]  Wow, an exhaust is 600 degrees?
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:09.820]  That's crazy.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:14.100]  I'm learning stuff from the Falcons.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:15.260]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:21.460]  I started looking up Robert De Niro's tattoos in Cape Fear.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.680]  He was scary in that movie.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.220]  He was so creepy.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:33.500]  I think the Sideshow Bob episode of The Simpsons is one of the best parody ever done.
[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.100]  It's so good.
[01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.160]  I totally agree.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:44.220]  Not enough people put their knife away by stabbing it into the table.
[01:34:45.080 --> 01:34:46.880]  I feel like that should make a comeback.
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:48.980]  Thunk! I'm done with dinner.
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.400]  Have you ever done that?
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:51.360]  No.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:52.600]  Yeah, probably.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:53.880]  Yeah.
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:54.400]  Yeah.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:00.260]  So the mouse did this?
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.960]  But it's not regular string.
[01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.900]  It's string cheese!
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:07.140]  It's string cheese!
[01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.780]  Oh my god.
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.820]  They're gonna be rich!
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:12.700]  This might be a true story.
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.260]  Borden?
[01:35:19.460 --> 01:35:20.100]  Is that you?
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.260]  This is insane.
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:26.480]  I would eat cheese like that.
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:27.520]  Me too.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.300]  That seems fun.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.660]  Vinny in the chat, are you fucking kidding me?
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.140]  Best goddamn cheese I've ever had!
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.660]  That's right, you bitches!
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.300]  The hero mouse!
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.280]  Give a little mouse salute, come on.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.800]  I like that they didn't change any of the machinery, though.
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.100]  It's still the same old shit.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:03.840]  They hired the oldest people they could find to work the cheese.
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.520]  It's the old original crew.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:09.320]  I don't know, they look older.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.960]  This is not how the original crew looked.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.620]  Oh, okay.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.170]  Cheese-based products.
[01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:22.270]  I'll take that, please. Thank you.
[01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.810]  Yeah!
[01:36:26.010 --> 01:36:26.910]  He's wearing a little hat!
[01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.670]  Oh, he hates it.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:32.920]  Curry?
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:35.920]  Oh, he loves it.
[01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:36.780]  He likes spaghetti.
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.440]  That's good.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:40.340]  String to herring?
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.140]  Peanut butter and jelly provolone?
[01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:50.600]  I want to talk to you about
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:51.640]  expansion and marketing.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.080]  Mr. Mouse, please.
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.340]  I'm going to go eat some sharp cheddar after this.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:57.580]  Dude, me too.
[01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:01.360]  We're making rat moves after this one, dude.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.600]  We're right at the end of the movie
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:06.760]  and in the chat, yeah, my suspension of disbelief
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:07.280]  is dead.
[01:37:08.860 --> 01:37:09.960]  Not wheels on the bus!
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.200]  A world without string is chaos,
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:14.420]  and up next is wheels on the bus!
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.640]  Oh, I think that's the guy
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:16.980]  that died.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.780]  I think it might be.
[01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:19.980]  Mr. Smunts?
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.640]  What a movie!
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:23.940]  That was so much fun!
[01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.840]  So glad you brought that into my life.
[01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:27.600]  Crazy.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.840]  Home Alone 1, Home Alone 2, Mouse Hunt.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.540]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.240]  That was a lot of fun.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.060]  Falcons, thank you for being here
[01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:38.360]  to watch Mouse Hunt with us.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.460]  Who would have thought that Mouse Hunt would have been that much fun?
[01:37:41.500 --> 01:37:43.220]  What are we watching next, Falcons?
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:45.620]  It'll have to be put to a vote, I suppose.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.460]  Somebody said there's a post-credit scene.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:48.920]  What?
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.980]  There's no way.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.920]  That doesn't sound right, let's see.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:53.960]  Skip ahead.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:57.820]  Do we put the movies
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.360]  that weren't picked back into the list?
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:01.320]  Why wouldn't you just skip ahead, Nick?
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:02.200]  Why are you Googling it?
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.440]  Because we're watching it with other people.
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:07.060]  It's the post-credit scene, who cares?
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.180]  Alright, fuck them.
[01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:10.660]  There's a guy named Lester Dinkus?
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.900]  Alright, everybody skip ahead.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:15.260]  Bum bum bum bum.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:15.840]  Uh oh.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:17.660]  Who is Lester Dinkus?
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.860]  I don't know, it just said Lester Dinkus,
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.860]  and then it was like the character name.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:23.620]  Let's see.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:24.940]  Nope, that's not it.
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:28.960]  If you hover over,
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:30.800]  I think it shows like a thumbnail of it.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.700]  Boy, Nick's being a real Dinkus right now.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.100]  Yeah, he's being a Lester Dinkus.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.100]  Okay, let's see, post-credit.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.200]  Wow, paramount.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:42.520]  Does the mouse climb the...
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:43.800]  Let's see.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.320]  Bullshit.
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:50.340]  Joker, you piece of shit.
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:50.880]  No, I'm just kidding.
[01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.740]  You trusted a guy named Joker?
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:54.820]  Dude, no kidding.
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.220]  He said, nah, I apologize.
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:00.320]  Alright, well.
[01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.980]  I can't believe Joker tricked me.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.720]  Who would have thought that Joker?
[01:39:05.620 --> 01:39:06.000]  Of all people.
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.760]  Who would have guessed?
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.240]  Well, this was so much fun.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:11.800]  Yeah, thanks for picking my movie.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:13.840]  Thank you so much for joining us
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.780]  in this mouse hunt watch-along.
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.720]  I can't wait for us to watch whatever we watch next.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:19.940]  This has been a lot of fun.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:20.880]  I agree.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.820]  I just wanted Andrew to do the outro.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.860]  I was waiting for someone else to pop in.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:28.020]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:29.620]  You were doing it.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.500]  I was just kind of talking.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:33.880]  I was in the moment.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:34.920]  I was just having a good time.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.140]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:39.400]  It means so much to us for you to support.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:40.920]  Falcons, do the outro.
[01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:42.780]  One word at a time.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.360]  Hang on, hang on.
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.240]  Hang on.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:48.260]  I'm going.
[01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:50.660]  Okay, there we go.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.460]  We're going to wait and see.
[01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.060]  We're going to wait and see.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:55.940]  Hang on.
[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.260]  Okay, Spummer.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.360]  This is your big moment.
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.280]  Hold on.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.640]  Spummer, you're going to do the outro.
[01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:09.420]  Thanks for watching, Falcons.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:10.920]  You're from England, Spummer?
[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:12.340]  Yeah.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.440]  Gav is not happy about that.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:15.900]  No, it's amazing.
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.040]  You made a new enemy today, Spummer.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:19.780]  Spummer, you're a Brit.
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:20.780]  I didn't even know that.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:22.640]  Ooh.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.040]  Sorry, Gav.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.500]  Sorry, Spummer.
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.720]  Sorry for interrupting. Go ahead.
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:31.900]  Thanks for watching, Falcons.
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:33.620]  We'll see you next time.
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:34.540]  Yeah!
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.180]  Way to go, Spummer!
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:39.880]  Alright, guys.
[01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:41.660]  That was the outro done by Spummer.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.180]  All Spumheads unite.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.000]  And we'll see you next time, guys.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:45.680]  Bye!
