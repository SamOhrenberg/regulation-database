[00:00.660 --> 00:01.560]  Oh no!
[00:01.760 --> 00:02.160]  Oh!
[00:02.700 --> 00:02.960]  Oh!
[00:03.360 --> 00:03.740]  Oh!
[00:04.100 --> 00:04.500]  Oh!
[00:04.880 --> 00:05.060]  Oh!
[00:05.100 --> 00:06.660]  The origin story.
[00:06.720 --> 00:07.560]  Oh my god.
[00:07.580 --> 00:08.300]  Grab it.
[00:08.380 --> 00:08.420]  Oh!
[00:09.580 --> 00:09.600]  Oh!
[00:09.600 --> 00:09.980]  Oh!
[00:10.120 --> 00:12.580]  Dude, these shots are awesome.
[00:12.920 --> 00:14.200]  I love this.
[00:19.160 --> 00:23.680]  They're really capturing what it feels like to see a gun in person for the first time.
[00:24.720 --> 00:25.200]  Uh...
[00:25.200 --> 00:25.640]  Oh!
[00:25.900 --> 00:26.780]  Fuck yeah!
[00:27.060 --> 00:27.680]  Oh my god.
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.040]  You got a gun.
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.400]  Time to do it.
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.920]  Oh my god!
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.720]  Just blow him away.
[00:37.300 --> 00:38.760]  The run with it.
[00:39.280 --> 00:42.400]  The recoil sends you halfway across the room.
