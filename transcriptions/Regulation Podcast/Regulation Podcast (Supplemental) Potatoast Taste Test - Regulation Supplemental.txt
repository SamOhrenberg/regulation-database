[00:17.480 --> 00:21.360]  Geoff is boiling potatoes, so we can get some mashed potatoes going.
[00:21.400 --> 00:27.100]  I got started this morning. I bought more potatoes, but I didn't like the look of a
[00:27.100 --> 00:28.540]  couple of them, so I threw them away.
[00:29.060 --> 00:31.040]  We're just going to have less potatoes.
[00:31.360 --> 00:36.640]  Gavin wants potatoes. What are the other ingredients for the potatoes? I don't remember, I'm sorry.
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.400]  I got toast. He asked for crispy fried onions, which I hope is what he wanted.
[00:43.820 --> 00:46.340]  You have to mash them up more, right? Is that the deal?
[00:46.880 --> 00:48.620]  He's just going to eat a handful right now.
[00:48.660 --> 00:53.140]  It's the closest I could come. And then I think he asked for black pepper, and that's it.
[00:54.860 --> 00:56.880]  And where did this come from? What was the idea?
[00:57.700 --> 00:59.400]  That's a good question. That's a great question.
[00:59.560 --> 01:02.480]  I reckon maybe tip them in a bowl, smash them up.
[01:02.820 --> 01:07.060]  If you're a referee, do you ever think that your name would be Referee Geoffrey?
[01:07.660 --> 01:13.800]  That's never crossed my mind in my entire life until now, but Ref Geoff is way better than Chef Geoff.
[01:14.960 --> 01:16.960]  What other jobs did you have that weren't Geoff?
[01:19.080 --> 01:20.180]  Uh, that's it.
[01:21.760 --> 01:24.640]  If you know some more names, leave them in the comments.
[01:24.640 --> 01:28.880]  You could be Oil Derrick Eric.
[01:30.460 --> 01:33.060]  But if my name was Derrick, then I could just be Oil Derrick.
[01:33.260 --> 01:34.260]  That's true, that'd be even better.
[01:38.820 --> 01:39.640]  Gavin, Gavin, Gavin!
[01:41.120 --> 01:42.220]  Did you think of Gavin?
[01:42.660 --> 01:44.140]  I just looked at Nick and said Dick.
[01:45.940 --> 01:47.900]  I'm not really a fan of the runs that run with my name.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.060]  How are these looking for you, Gavin?
[01:51.820 --> 01:52.140]  Phenomenal.
[01:54.460 --> 01:54.860]  Amazing.
[01:55.840 --> 01:58.280]  There was a big piece that was irritating.
[01:58.900 --> 01:59.560]  Oh, look at this!
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.940]  Right into the colander.
[02:03.320 --> 02:03.980]  Look at that.
[02:04.140 --> 02:05.120]  Look at that.
[02:06.300 --> 02:07.780]  I wish I had a gas range at my house.
[02:08.320 --> 02:09.360]  Dude, gas rules.
[02:11.300 --> 02:12.100]  Yeah, gas.
[02:13.260 --> 02:16.220]  I just, I just like a gas stove top is so much better than a gas stove top.
[02:16.220 --> 02:18.100]  You need like a fume hood.
[02:19.940 --> 02:21.200]  You have, don't you have that anyway?
[02:21.200 --> 02:21.800]  What?
[02:22.080 --> 02:24.660]  Why do you need a fume hood?
[02:25.000 --> 02:25.780]  Because of the gas.
[02:27.300 --> 02:28.620]  Carbon monoxide poisoning.
[02:28.920 --> 02:32.140]  Do you not, do you not have like a hood over your...
[02:32.140 --> 02:32.320]  Yeah.
[02:33.300 --> 02:34.400]  It's just an extra thing.
[02:34.840 --> 02:36.560]  It's not like, oh, let's just get gas.
[02:36.720 --> 02:37.940]  You've got to get all the other gas shit.
[02:38.080 --> 02:41.020]  I have a hood over my stove and it's electric.
[02:42.360 --> 02:43.120]  Yeah, I mean...
[02:43.120 --> 02:44.060]  It's for if you burn shit.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.660]  What's the point of that?
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.380]  He just said it.
[02:53.560 --> 02:53.920]  Yeah.
[02:57.600 --> 02:58.460]  You didn't know that?
[02:59.500 --> 03:01.020]  Well, I might as well have known because I've got gas.
[03:01.100 --> 03:02.260]  I just thought it was because of the gas.
[03:02.520 --> 03:02.880]  No.
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.840]  Easy mistake to make.
[03:05.420 --> 03:05.620]  Yeah.
[03:06.980 --> 03:07.480]  It's alright.
[03:09.700 --> 03:11.220]  This is how regulation works.
[03:11.360 --> 03:12.620]  One of you sounds stupid.
[03:12.800 --> 03:14.280]  Two of you make fun of that person.
[03:14.640 --> 03:16.400]  And then the other person gets all the work done.
[03:17.380 --> 03:18.880]  That's a bad hit.
[03:18.880 --> 03:20.180]  It's how we've been running this company.
[03:21.660 --> 03:22.560]  Look at this.
[03:23.460 --> 03:24.720]  It's looking pretty creamy.
[03:26.460 --> 03:27.440]  I think this is how it is.
[03:27.520 --> 03:28.340]  You're doing great work, man.
[03:28.920 --> 03:30.720]  Dante's sitting about 80% of the way there.
[03:31.140 --> 03:32.420]  Gavin Neal's actually in there.
[03:33.500 --> 03:34.700]  So, here's what we're going to do.
[03:36.160 --> 03:36.860]  What are we doing?
[03:38.400 --> 03:39.580]  The metal handle.
[03:39.900 --> 03:41.000]  Never understood it.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.100]  I don't get it either.
[03:42.960 --> 03:43.720]  What's the point?
[03:44.440 --> 03:45.860]  It looks nice, but it hurts.
[03:45.860 --> 03:46.340]  It looks great.
[03:47.560 --> 03:48.520]  The handle?
[03:48.680 --> 03:49.600]  Yeah, the metal handle.
[03:51.960 --> 03:53.960]  I love this Albert's at the bottom
[03:53.960 --> 03:55.720]  as if he's going to get any of it.
[03:55.720 --> 03:58.120]  He's never had human food in his life.
[03:58.320 --> 03:59.620]  He's only ever eaten meat.
[03:59.780 --> 04:01.240]  If I beat him in Twix,
[04:01.480 --> 04:03.060]  he would immediately die.
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.240]  Oh my goodness.
[04:05.640 --> 04:06.700]  I smell toast.
[04:06.860 --> 04:08.600]  That toast is too burnt. Let's make some more.
[04:09.900 --> 04:10.820]  I'll have one toast.
[04:11.980 --> 04:13.080]  Toss me a test toast.
[04:13.900 --> 04:14.640]  Test toast?
[04:14.820 --> 04:15.140]  Just one.
[04:15.440 --> 04:16.860]  Nice catch.
[04:22.780 --> 04:23.580]  How's that looking?
[04:23.800 --> 04:24.300]  It's looking good.
[04:24.660 --> 04:26.960]  I feel like it's not wet enough to make the bread soggy.
[04:31.260 --> 04:32.500]  Look at that.
[04:32.560 --> 04:33.720]  That's a nice spread.
[04:33.880 --> 04:35.260]  Like it's buttery goodness.
[04:37.820 --> 04:39.020]  Spread isn't as easy as butter.
[04:39.620 --> 04:40.180]  Well, it is.
[04:40.180 --> 04:41.200]  Well, it's potatoes.
[04:42.260 --> 04:43.640]  It does have a lot of butter in it.
[04:44.340 --> 04:45.820]  It's because Andrew thought
[04:46.460 --> 04:48.200]  the butter in a picture was potato.
[04:48.800 --> 04:49.740]  This is why we're doing it, right?
[04:50.620 --> 04:50.940]  Yes.
[04:51.460 --> 04:53.180]  From your cornbread fish.
[04:55.820 --> 04:57.300]  Andrew, why are we doing this?
[04:57.380 --> 04:58.280]  Let us know in the comments.
[04:59.600 --> 05:02.020]  So this is pretty much exactly how I envisioned it.
[05:02.400 --> 05:02.520]  Okay.
[05:05.300 --> 05:06.140]  This is...
[05:06.140 --> 05:07.940]  some British-ass food, dude.
[05:09.380 --> 05:09.780]  Ooh.
[05:10.020 --> 05:11.200]  We'll cut it so we can...
[05:11.200 --> 05:11.860]  Oh, he's done.
[05:11.980 --> 05:12.500]  We can try.
[05:14.620 --> 05:16.380]  Can you cut it into quarters?
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.440]  Let me just make it a little bit more fair.
[05:19.100 --> 05:19.800]  Oh, I like it.
[05:20.520 --> 05:21.220]  Do you like it?
[05:21.820 --> 05:23.460]  Of course he does. It's food.
[05:24.940 --> 05:27.040]  We ate Panda Express yesterday,
[05:27.260 --> 05:29.880]  and it was like...
[05:29.880 --> 05:31.480]  Panda Express might be the place
[05:31.480 --> 05:33.320]  that I would like to eat the least on this.
[05:35.720 --> 05:36.680]  All right, Jake.
[05:36.920 --> 05:39.460]  This is the first official tasting of mashed potatoes.
[05:39.920 --> 05:40.840]  Let's make it all fit together.
[05:40.840 --> 05:42.320]  Cheers. That's a great thumbnail right there.
[05:42.360 --> 05:44.540]  Look at the camera and go...
[05:44.540 --> 05:45.120]  There you go.
[05:46.100 --> 05:47.400]  We're gonna be millionaires.
[05:48.580 --> 05:49.560]  All right, down the hatch.
[05:49.840 --> 05:50.100]  Cheers.
[05:51.900 --> 05:52.920]  I mean, it's great.
[05:53.480 --> 05:54.800]  It's fucking awesome.
[05:54.920 --> 05:55.260]  Yeah, phenomenal.
[05:57.720 --> 05:58.160]  Wow.
[05:59.580 --> 06:01.820]  It's buttery potatoes on bread
[06:01.820 --> 06:02.860]  and these onion things.
[06:03.120 --> 06:04.920]  That is so good.
[06:05.620 --> 06:07.400]  That is so fucking good.
[06:07.520 --> 06:09.180]  I can't eat butter on toast alone now.
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.700]  Yeah, I don't know if I can ever have toast
[06:11.700 --> 06:12.780]  without mashed potatoes again.
[06:13.760 --> 06:15.200]  How did I make it 49 years?
[06:17.160 --> 06:18.320]  Are they the best thing
[06:18.320 --> 06:19.720]  I've ever eaten in my life?
[06:20.100 --> 06:20.900]  Give me the burnt piece.
[06:21.740 --> 06:22.840]  We've got that one coming.
[06:23.600 --> 06:25.680]  Oh, yeah, go crazy.
[06:25.980 --> 06:26.620]  I'll eat more of that.
[06:26.940 --> 06:27.420]  Yeah, please.
[06:28.020 --> 06:29.980]  I think I just came up with a new dish.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.600]  This is a new dish for Thanksgiving now.
[06:31.860 --> 06:32.760]  Oh my god, yeah.
[06:33.800 --> 06:34.920]  This is, uh...
[06:34.920 --> 06:37.280]  We gotta make another cookbook. We have to make a regulation cookbook now.
[06:37.300 --> 06:38.880]  This is really good.
[06:38.940 --> 06:41.600]  That might be the least offensive tasting thing
[06:41.600 --> 06:42.160]  we've ever made.
[06:42.220 --> 06:44.900]  That looks disgusting when you slop it on.
[06:45.220 --> 06:47.620]  You spread it out, it doesn't look very good.
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.920]  It tastes so good.
[06:49.140 --> 06:51.380]  This is the closest thing to food we've ever made.
[06:51.380 --> 06:52.700]  I absolutely agree.
[06:52.820 --> 06:53.980]  All the ingredients are food.
[06:54.740 --> 06:56.340]  And it tastes great stocked.
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.840]  It has all the flavors that I like.
[06:57.960 --> 07:00.060]  Butter, onion, bread, garlic.
[07:00.720 --> 07:01.620]  Got a nice crunch.
[07:01.960 --> 07:03.860]  Potato. It's got crunch.
[07:04.000 --> 07:05.140]  It's got a real nice crunch.
[07:05.320 --> 07:06.480]  The creaminess of potato.
[07:09.780 --> 07:11.060]  We're simple men.
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.460]  We enjoy simple things.
[07:14.360 --> 07:15.780]  I'm a little bit sad that it's so
[07:15.780 --> 07:17.140]  normal and good.
[07:17.980 --> 07:18.700]  I'm not.
[07:19.620 --> 07:20.800]  Yeah, there you go.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.420]  There you go.
[07:22.740 --> 07:24.900]  After like 240 episodes,
[07:24.980 --> 07:26.140]  it's cool that we got a win.
[07:26.960 --> 07:28.680]  It's not just another freak show
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.560]  piece of shit.
[07:30.140 --> 07:32.480]  Somebody would eat this and go like...
[07:32.480 --> 07:34.520]  Oh, look at this.
[07:35.040 --> 07:35.160]  Here.
[07:38.340 --> 07:39.860]  I don't mind the burn.
[07:42.040 --> 07:43.700]  I wonder what the nutritional value is.
[07:43.920 --> 07:44.440]  Negative.
[07:45.120 --> 07:46.960]  It's actively taking it out of you.
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.360]  You're losing nutrition by eating this.
[07:49.360 --> 07:50.040]  This sucks nutrition.
[07:50.100 --> 07:52.860]  This tastes like licking God's cock.
[07:54.540 --> 07:55.600]  Alright, well I think I'm done.
[07:55.900 --> 07:57.000]  I think it just tastes like
[07:57.000 --> 07:58.500]  good potatoes on bread.
[07:59.220 --> 08:00.720]  Your thing's good too though, I guess.
[08:00.900 --> 08:01.880]  Let me ask you this.
[08:02.800 --> 08:03.500]  Bowl of gravy.
[08:04.340 --> 08:05.040]  Oh, yeah.
[08:07.100 --> 08:08.240]  Or brown gravy.
[08:08.900 --> 08:10.600]  I was thinking you'd go white or brown.
[08:10.880 --> 08:11.380]  This is a good one.
[08:13.360 --> 08:14.640]  You know how like
[08:15.260 --> 08:16.720]  breakfast kind of leaks into lunch?
[08:16.720 --> 08:18.260]  Brunch and all that shit.
[08:18.820 --> 08:20.140]  This is breakfast dinner.
[08:20.660 --> 08:21.260]  It is.
[08:21.820 --> 08:23.080]  This is a big dinner meal.
[08:24.480 --> 08:25.600]  It's big time dinner.
[08:28.600 --> 08:29.400]  You'll brinner.
[08:36.180 --> 08:37.380]  Gavin, congratulations.
[08:37.540 --> 08:39.000]  That was a huge success.
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.280]  Maybe the first success in the history
[08:41.280 --> 08:42.000]  of regulation.
[08:43.920 --> 08:44.940]  You've done it.
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.000]  Bravo.
[08:46.000 --> 08:46.780]  Bravo.
[08:48.060 --> 08:49.960]  I think now...
[08:49.960 --> 08:50.940]  Andrew's gonna be pissed.
[08:51.060 --> 08:53.240]  If people watching want to make their own
[08:55.520 --> 08:55.920]  potatoes,
[08:57.180 --> 08:58.400]  let us know your modifiers.
[08:58.520 --> 08:59.300]  Did you go for gravy?
[08:59.620 --> 09:00.500]  Did you add something else?
[09:01.920 --> 09:04.280]  This is so close to being like
[09:05.500 --> 09:06.300]  a Thanksgiving
[09:06.300 --> 09:07.540]  sandwich, right?
[09:07.720 --> 09:09.120]  You put some turkey on that thing,
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.360]  you're really cooking.
[09:11.180 --> 09:12.260]  You know what I was thinking?
[09:12.260 --> 09:13.360]  Keep it veg.
[09:13.920 --> 09:16.200]  You could just put a tiny dusting
[09:16.200 --> 09:16.840]  of chives.
[09:18.200 --> 09:19.260]  Now we're talking.
[09:20.680 --> 09:22.040]  I like that.
[09:22.680 --> 09:24.160]  I think we're at the beginning of something good.
[09:24.460 --> 09:26.100]  This is the start of something.
[09:26.300 --> 09:27.600]  A little splash of hot sauce?
[09:28.220 --> 09:29.460]  Hot sauce would be great on it.
[09:30.960 --> 09:31.880]  I'm really impressed.
[09:32.380 --> 09:33.760]  I'm very impressed by what I just ate.
[09:34.140 --> 09:35.700]  Also, I just get to keep eating fried onions.
[09:35.880 --> 09:37.180]  I'm pretty happy.
[09:37.500 --> 09:38.540]  He's also impressed with those.
[09:38.540 --> 09:41.120]  I think if you pulled that out
[09:41.120 --> 09:42.380]  at Thanksgiving, everyone would go,
[09:42.680 --> 09:44.620]  what? And then it would be the thing that everyone
[09:44.620 --> 09:46.660]  talked about until next year when they
[09:46.660 --> 09:47.820]  asked, do you have that again?
[09:48.360 --> 09:50.220]  Did you bring any more of that toast?
[09:51.320 --> 09:52.380]  That's exactly what happened.
[09:52.560 --> 09:53.500]  Are you just going for it?
[09:56.040 --> 09:56.800]  That's awesome.
[09:59.020 --> 10:00.240]  Well, thanks for watching.
[10:00.400 --> 10:02.920]  If you like this, leave a comment with your modifiers.
[10:03.040 --> 10:03.540]  Make it at home.
[10:03.940 --> 10:07.240]  Let Andrew know you missed out on our delicious toast.
[10:07.240 --> 10:08.340]  Send us your recipes.
[10:08.640 --> 10:11.120]  Send us pictures of your own monstrosities.
[10:11.240 --> 10:11.800]  We'd love to see them.
[10:12.840 --> 10:13.960]  That doesn't sound good.
