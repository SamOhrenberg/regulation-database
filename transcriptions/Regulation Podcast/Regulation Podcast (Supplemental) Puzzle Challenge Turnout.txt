[00:00.000 --> 00:02.100]  Here's what's going on. Here's what's going on.
[00:02.140 --> 00:02.680]  Didn't even get a drumroll.
[00:02.980 --> 00:07.060]  No, no. This sucks. This sucks.
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.060]  I'm trying to find Geoff's time.
[00:09.360 --> 00:12.180]  It doesn't matter. He wins by default.
[00:12.800 --> 00:13.720]  That puzzle was a motherfucker.
[00:14.160 --> 00:15.500]  It was. It was.
[00:15.660 --> 00:19.100]  And Gavin's time was one hour and five minutes.
[00:19.700 --> 00:21.500]  What? However,
[00:22.540 --> 00:24.800]  that's the image that Gavin submitted to me.
[00:25.760 --> 00:29.160]  So that's where I was after an hour and five minutes.
[00:29.640 --> 00:31.740]  Pause the timer, had to go out,
[00:32.560 --> 00:36.140]  came back and the cats have kicked it, kicked the shit out of it.
[00:37.240 --> 00:39.800]  And let's face it, if I was at that point at an hour and five minutes,
[00:39.880 --> 00:41.360]  I would have been like for 24 hours.
[00:41.720 --> 00:44.300]  Yeah, I I hate that puzzle so much.
[00:44.400 --> 00:47.380]  The entire rim is green and trees.
[00:47.580 --> 00:50.040]  You don't know what you're working on. It's bullshit.
