[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Hello and welcome to episode two of Regulation Feud.
[00:04.220 --> 00:09.920]  In a best of three series, we have Team Annie versus Team Gigi.
[00:10.240 --> 00:12.860]  How are you guys doing? Great. Yeah.
[00:12.960 --> 00:15.040]  This is under protest. We will not be...
[00:15.800 --> 00:17.140]  This doesn't... None of this matters.
[00:17.780 --> 00:20.180]  Thank you for listening to this thing that doesn't matter.
[00:20.360 --> 00:21.480]  We appreciate you so much.
[00:21.600 --> 00:24.020]  Listen, you protested the first game fairly.
[00:25.100 --> 00:25.580]  Understandably.
[00:26.520 --> 00:28.780]  This is a whole new game. You can't protest this game.
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.220]  Nothing's happened in this game yet.
[00:30.480 --> 00:33.280]  No, just based on how it's been going the last 20 minutes,
[00:33.420 --> 00:36.300]  I'm getting ahead of the curve and protesting this one too.
[00:36.580 --> 00:38.680]  Yeah, he's filing a pre-protest.
[00:38.760 --> 00:39.180]  Absolutely.
[00:39.400 --> 00:42.400]  I'm going to acknowledge your pre-protest doo-doo.
[00:42.640 --> 00:44.700]  What happened? Well, the effects of last game.
[00:44.760 --> 00:45.640]  I said doo-doo. That's fine.
[00:45.780 --> 00:45.920]  I'm sorry.
[00:46.960 --> 00:50.920]  I said doo-doo. That was real funny.
[00:51.260 --> 00:53.640]  That was real hard for me to step away from that.
[00:55.020 --> 00:55.780]  This is awful.
[00:56.180 --> 00:58.400]  Anyway, we got the same teams.
[00:59.160 --> 01:04.100]  I, uh, you know, was the end of the last game unfairly given to a certain team?
[01:04.420 --> 01:04.880]  Who can say?
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.300]  I mean, we knew our halo.
[01:07.780 --> 01:08.040]  Yeah.
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.600]  Yeltsin, if they didn't know their halo.
[01:10.420 --> 01:11.800]  Guess what? We had the same answer.
[01:12.040 --> 01:13.020]  Yeah, like, absolutely.
[01:13.300 --> 01:15.520]  What, which of the other halos would you have picked?
[01:15.680 --> 01:17.080]  Like, yeah, put five in there.
[01:17.320 --> 01:19.560]  Like, here's the thing, Eric, if you would have guessed 81,
[01:19.840 --> 01:22.380]  then Gavin would have been 82 and you would have won.
[01:22.520 --> 01:24.660]  So really, if you were just one off, that would be you.
[01:25.020 --> 01:27.240]  I mean, none of this matters. It doesn't matter.
[01:27.240 --> 01:30.080]  Hey, why don't you go ahead and show me how to share a window again, Andrew?
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.620]  We can spend five more minutes on that, man.
[01:31.800 --> 01:33.380]  Eric, what have we done that did matter?
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.740]  That's a great question.
[01:37.800 --> 01:39.400]  Gavin, that's a pretty fair question.
[01:40.220 --> 01:41.900]  Back in. Protest over.
[01:42.280 --> 01:43.360]  Ooh, protest removed.
[01:43.740 --> 01:44.640]  All right, here we go.
[01:45.420 --> 01:47.380]  Protest definitely not removed, but we're still in this.
[01:47.700 --> 01:48.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:49.320 --> 01:50.300]  Nick and Gavin.
[01:51.080 --> 01:52.860]  No, Gavin's last time. It'd be Nick and Geoff this time.
[01:53.020 --> 01:55.120]  Well, you pick. You guys pick. You do whatever you want.
[01:55.120 --> 01:56.480]  We want to go with Nick and Gavin.
[01:56.480 --> 01:58.160]  Yeah, let's go with Nick and Gavin.
[01:58.260 --> 01:59.520]  Let's go with Nick and Gavin.
[02:00.520 --> 02:06.760]  The decider for this one is how many unique video games feature E.T.?
[02:06.760 --> 02:08.140]  How many unique games feature E.T.?
[02:08.140 --> 02:09.280]  I'm going to count down.
[02:09.680 --> 02:10.560]  Should I email it to you?
[02:10.820 --> 02:12.540]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't don't count down.
[02:13.040 --> 02:13.620]  What are we doing?
[02:13.820 --> 02:14.080]  We just.
[02:14.160 --> 02:15.100]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, just like me.
[02:15.120 --> 02:16.180]  Yeah, it's like, yeah, it's like.
[02:17.000 --> 02:17.960]  Oh, I'm going to.
[02:18.160 --> 02:20.420]  Andrew, I'm going to fucking flip, dude.
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.560]  This is insane.
[02:23.860 --> 02:25.420]  Specifically, specifically E.T.?
[02:26.660 --> 02:28.860]  Specifically E.T.?
[02:28.860 --> 02:30.020]  The extraterrestrial?
[02:30.420 --> 02:34.180]  Yeah, the extraterrestrial, the Steven Spielberg classic.
[02:34.500 --> 02:36.020]  Feel free to slack me.
[02:36.340 --> 02:37.860]  Are references included?
[02:38.200 --> 02:39.220]  Geoff, I'm going to throw up.
[02:39.540 --> 02:40.240]  I'm sorry, Eric.
[02:40.420 --> 02:43.560]  You're you're you're you're road catcher.
[02:43.780 --> 02:46.060]  I've received a guess from Gavin.
[02:46.880 --> 02:48.920]  Nick, could you send me your guess?
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.300]  Uh, clarification, not references, just actually about E.T.?
[02:54.300 --> 02:57.100]  Uh, games that E.T. is in.
[02:57.380 --> 02:58.800]  Like the character is physically in?
[02:59.420 --> 03:01.440]  Yes, I have both numbers.
[03:02.400 --> 03:04.520]  Nick said six.
[03:05.140 --> 03:07.380]  Gavin said 21.
[03:07.700 --> 03:11.900]  The correct answer to the game is 13.
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.180]  Nick, you narrowly win for your team.
[03:16.940 --> 03:17.160]  Damn it.
[03:17.560 --> 03:23.960]  Let's scroll to the next question, which is what is the most iconic video game character?
[03:24.640 --> 03:25.980]  Do you want to play or pass?
[03:26.840 --> 03:27.780]  We want to play.
[03:28.140 --> 03:29.340]  Wow, right into it.
[03:29.620 --> 03:32.040]  Okay, most iconic video game character.
[03:32.140 --> 03:32.920]  What do you guys think?
[03:33.120 --> 03:34.460]  We can't leave it to chance again.
[03:34.580 --> 03:35.280]  That's or Andrew.
[03:35.480 --> 03:35.680]  Yeah.
[03:39.480 --> 03:42.160]  Uh, do you want to take the first crack at this one?
[03:42.200 --> 03:42.780]  You want me to?
[03:43.080 --> 03:45.440]  Hey, you guys can go back and forth if you want to talk about it.
[03:45.840 --> 03:46.940]  Yeah, we could talk about it.
[03:47.100 --> 03:49.080]  I'm leaning towards like Sonic or Mario.
[03:49.160 --> 03:51.180]  Yeah, I mean, I think I think Mario has to be the first guess.
[03:51.600 --> 03:53.300]  Yeah, I think Mario is.
[03:53.300 --> 03:56.160]  Yeah, yeah, we already said we're gonna.
[03:56.280 --> 03:56.860]  They already said that.
[03:57.000 --> 03:57.940]  They already locked that in.
[04:00.620 --> 04:03.600]  The most popular guess is Mario.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.680]  Knock that out already.
[04:06.120 --> 04:11.180]  Now, now do you think now, Nick, do you think that the number four is Sonic the Hedgehog?
[04:11.580 --> 04:12.600]  But this group, I don't know.
[04:12.640 --> 04:13.140]  Here's the thing.
[04:13.240 --> 04:14.460]  Like our audience.
[04:15.440 --> 04:16.000]  Are they?
[04:16.240 --> 04:17.760]  You think they're a little younger than us?
[04:17.820 --> 04:18.900]  No, I just think they're freaks.
[04:19.340 --> 04:19.760]  Oh, yeah.
[04:19.820 --> 04:20.840]  So then maybe Master Chief?
[04:21.080 --> 04:22.500]  Oh, Master Chief might be a good guess.
[04:22.500 --> 04:24.260]  Yeah, let's go with it.
[04:24.320 --> 04:24.660]  I don't care.
[04:24.820 --> 04:25.220]  Let's do it.
[04:25.380 --> 04:25.980]  None of this matters.
[04:26.080 --> 04:26.700]  It's all under protest.
[04:26.820 --> 04:27.220]  It doesn't matter.
[04:27.460 --> 04:27.960]  Let's do Master Chief.
[04:28.280 --> 04:28.600]  Absolutely.
[04:28.880 --> 04:29.480]  Yeah, Master Chief.
[04:29.840 --> 04:30.500]  We'll do Master Chief.
[04:30.600 --> 04:30.720]  Yeah.
[04:30.880 --> 04:32.680]  Master Chief is the guess.
[04:32.960 --> 04:33.840]  I'm gonna say he's number two.
[04:34.460 --> 04:34.860]  Probably.
[04:35.160 --> 04:35.500]  Or three.
[04:36.380 --> 04:37.180]  John 117.
[04:38.020 --> 04:38.900]  Yeah, baby!
[04:39.140 --> 04:39.800]  Is that his name?
[04:40.340 --> 04:42.040]  Yeah, that's his name and designation.
[04:42.380 --> 04:42.740]  Legal name.
[04:43.360 --> 04:45.160]  His most, the most iconic.
[04:46.760 --> 04:47.700]  In the books.
[04:47.940 --> 04:49.540]  Two most iconic video game characters.
[04:49.660 --> 04:52.120]  A guy named John 117.
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.920]  Mario and John 117.
[04:54.400 --> 04:55.340]  The most iconic.
[04:55.680 --> 04:59.240]  I went to the Halo 3 UK premiere at the IMAX theater in London,
[04:59.540 --> 05:02.900]  and when a Master Chief came out, everyone started chanting John.
[05:06.120 --> 05:08.340]  I don't know Halo at all.
[05:08.560 --> 05:10.360]  I have not beat any of these games.
[05:10.480 --> 05:12.680]  I don't know shit about John 117.
[05:12.860 --> 05:14.640]  What happened to, are there, is, it doesn't matter.
[05:14.780 --> 05:15.260]  Why do I ask?
[05:15.300 --> 05:15.740]  It doesn't matter.
[05:15.880 --> 05:16.880]  He's a super soldier.
[05:17.100 --> 05:18.500]  He's like Captain America, kind of.
[05:18.820 --> 05:19.100]  Yeah.
[05:19.260 --> 05:19.460]  Yeah.
[05:19.460 --> 05:22.840]  He was abducted as a child and replaced with a clone that died.
[05:22.900 --> 05:23.680]  A Flash clone.
[05:23.940 --> 05:25.760]  They died out like within a year or two.
[05:25.900 --> 05:26.100]  Yeah.
[05:26.600 --> 05:30.420]  I thought it was like, I thought like the suit made him powerful or something.
[05:30.820 --> 05:35.120]  Well, they're super human augmented and then the suit makes them stronger.
[05:36.080 --> 05:38.560]  Anyway, what's the most iconic video game character?
[05:38.860 --> 05:41.400]  I think it's gotta be, I think Sonic the Hedgehog is on this list.
[05:41.420 --> 05:42.120]  Yeah, let's do Sonic.
[05:42.320 --> 05:43.020]  Let's go with the gut.
[05:43.420 --> 05:44.460]  Sonic is the guess.
[05:45.320 --> 05:49.220]  Sonic is the least popular iconic video game character.
[05:49.460 --> 05:54.140]  You guys still have to figure out the second and third least popular.
[05:54.400 --> 05:54.680]  Okay.
[05:55.360 --> 05:56.180]  Oh, dude.
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.460]  Do we go with...
[05:57.980 --> 05:59.020]  Do you think Doomguy?
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.140]  No, I'm thinking more like Pikachu.
[06:03.000 --> 06:03.980]  Oh, Pikachu's interesting.
[06:04.580 --> 06:06.960]  Do you think they go with Zelda or Link?
[06:07.360 --> 06:08.700]  Ooh, interesting.
[06:09.720 --> 06:11.860]  They probably do a Minecraft thing.
[06:12.180 --> 06:15.320]  And I don't know who any of those characters are, so I can't go with that.
[06:17.600 --> 06:18.180]  Shit.
[06:18.180 --> 06:20.260]  It's much more complicated on this.
[06:21.040 --> 06:24.400]  That's why I was thinking about passing, but you're jumping on play real quick.
[06:24.600 --> 06:25.520]  So I say go for it.
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.280]  I can't believe you played.
[06:26.320 --> 06:26.880]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[06:27.720 --> 06:30.320]  I felt like Mario and Sonic were like locks.
[06:30.420 --> 06:31.860]  And then the rest are like, I don't know, man.
[06:32.080 --> 06:32.480]  Fascinating.
[06:32.840 --> 06:33.240]  Anywhere.
[06:34.020 --> 06:36.840]  I guess we'll just go, like, you want to go with like, you go with Link?
[06:37.340 --> 06:37.840]  Let's do Link.
[06:38.040 --> 06:38.380]  All right.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.280]  I don't think he's on the list, but we're going to give it a shot.
[06:40.680 --> 06:42.120]  Link is the guess.
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.160]  Link is the third most popular pick by our audience.
[06:48.720 --> 06:49.160]  Wow.
[06:49.520 --> 06:49.820]  All right.
[06:50.680 --> 06:51.560]  One left.
[06:51.680 --> 06:54.100]  You're missing one to sweep the category.
[06:54.200 --> 06:56.200]  What if Gavin said Link 2?
[06:56.300 --> 06:57.960]  Would you give him the win in the whole thing?
[06:57.980 --> 06:58.940]  Because it's just one more.
[06:59.260 --> 07:02.460]  I would give it to him if he said Link 117, but not Link 2.
[07:04.340 --> 07:06.700]  Boy, I want to go with something like Pikachu.
[07:07.160 --> 07:09.820]  Less popular than Link, but more popular than Sonic.
[07:10.140 --> 07:13.420]  Yeah, but Sonic being at the bottom of that list is really weird to me.
[07:13.740 --> 07:15.840]  Like, I feel like Sonic would be much higher.
[07:15.840 --> 07:20.600]  I feel like he hasn't been represented as well in this last generation.
[07:21.020 --> 07:22.940]  No, but he had the one game with, like, the comeback.
[07:23.340 --> 07:25.560]  And his fans, Sonic fans, are freaks, dude.
[07:25.820 --> 07:29.720]  Like, they keep drawing his feet and, like, sucking his toes and going nuts.
[07:29.940 --> 07:30.540]  Like, it's not good.
[07:30.700 --> 07:32.700]  He did have the two movies, I guess, as well.
[07:32.840 --> 07:33.000]  Yeah.
[07:33.360 --> 07:34.300]  Oh, then it's got to be Pikachu.
[07:34.580 --> 07:35.340]  It has to be Pikachu.
[07:35.560 --> 07:39.200]  Because he did the movie with Ryan Reynolds, right?
[07:39.940 --> 07:40.100]  Yeah.
[07:40.200 --> 07:40.560]  He did.
[07:41.440 --> 07:41.760]  Do Pikachu.
[07:42.020 --> 07:44.440]  Pikachu is the guess.
[07:45.220 --> 07:47.420]  Pikachu is the correct answer.
[07:47.980 --> 07:55.520]  Nick and Eric sweep the first round 15 points to none.
[07:56.120 --> 07:56.940]  I gotta be honest.
[07:57.020 --> 07:58.260]  I don't think we would have got there.
[07:58.700 --> 07:59.440]  No, I don't think so either.
[07:59.540 --> 08:01.140]  Nah, I wouldn't have put Pikachu.
[08:01.560 --> 08:02.140]  I wouldn't have either.
[08:02.420 --> 08:03.160]  Who would you have picked?
[08:03.220 --> 08:04.360]  Who do you guys think you would have picked?
[08:04.780 --> 08:06.980]  I think Steve, but you didn't know his name.
[08:07.280 --> 08:08.200]  Steve from Minecraft, maybe?
[08:08.260 --> 08:09.500]  Yeah, maybe Steve.
[08:10.540 --> 08:11.700]  Oh, Minecraft Steve.
[08:11.700 --> 08:13.980]  You think even like retro, like Pac-Man?
[08:14.480 --> 08:16.040]  Oh yeah, I was thinking Kirby for a second.
[08:16.740 --> 08:17.660]  Moving on.
[08:18.100 --> 08:18.580]  Luigi.
[08:19.400 --> 08:20.600]  To the next decider.
[08:21.140 --> 08:22.180]  Who's playing this?
[08:22.680 --> 08:23.400]  I guess it's me and Eric.
[08:23.860 --> 08:24.260]  Yeah, sure.
[08:24.320 --> 08:24.620]  Yeah, straight.
[08:24.840 --> 08:29.880]  Geoff and Eric, if you combine the Rotten Tomatoes scores of John Cena's first four films that have
[08:29.880 --> 08:32.200]  reviews, what is the combined number?
[08:34.600 --> 08:36.540]  Are we slacking it to you?
[08:36.780 --> 08:37.720]  Yeah, just slack it to me.
[08:37.960 --> 08:38.240]  Great.
[08:39.500 --> 08:39.840]  Okay.
[08:40.580 --> 08:40.980]  Uh-huh.
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.280]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[08:46.200 --> 08:49.100]  I've received guesses by both parties.
[08:49.800 --> 08:50.860]  Eric has guessed 80.
[08:51.300 --> 08:51.460]  Yeah.
[08:52.720 --> 08:55.100]  Geoff has guessed 74.
[08:58.560 --> 09:02.340]  I'm gonna read you what the movies are and the percentages.
[09:02.700 --> 09:03.640]  Then we gotta do math.
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.580]  No, I have the number already written.
[09:05.660 --> 09:06.820]  I'm just gonna read it to build suspense.
[09:07.560 --> 09:09.940]  His first film, The Marine, 17%.
[09:10.540 --> 09:10.960]  Yeah.
[09:10.960 --> 09:14.320]  The next one with reviews, 12 rounds, 31%.
[09:15.260 --> 09:19.600]  The next one with reviews, Fred the Movie, 0%.
[09:20.380 --> 09:20.700]  Yeah!
[09:20.880 --> 09:21.640]  Oh, shit!
[09:22.340 --> 09:26.000]  His next one is called Legendary, 20%.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.020]  And the last is The Reunion, 8%.
[09:31.680 --> 09:34.020]  Which comes to a total of 76.
[09:34.460 --> 09:38.540]  Geoff, you have won the round, but that was incredibly close.
[09:38.720 --> 09:39.540]  Yeah, that was really great.
[09:39.780 --> 09:39.880]  Wow.
[09:39.880 --> 09:41.080]  Holy shit.
[09:41.140 --> 09:43.840]  Geoff won within two, Eric lost within four.
[09:44.000 --> 09:44.740]  Like, that was...
[09:44.740 --> 09:47.620]  You're doing a joke number, but that was genuinely a great guess.
[09:47.800 --> 09:49.360]  I really thought Geoff was gonna say 81.
[09:50.040 --> 09:51.200]  I was expecting the same.
[09:51.700 --> 09:52.500]  Next question.
[09:52.840 --> 09:54.200]  What's the best Rockstar game?
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.220]  Wow.
[09:55.360 --> 09:56.260]  Geoff, what do you like to play?
[09:56.840 --> 09:57.780]  Oh, shit!
[09:57.940 --> 09:58.700]  What do you think, Gav?
[09:58.740 --> 09:59.300]  Do we want to play?
[10:01.540 --> 10:03.260]  I mean, there's not a ton, right?
[10:03.700 --> 10:04.000]  Right.
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.300]  There's quite a few.
[10:05.740 --> 10:06.120]  Oh, cool.
[10:06.180 --> 10:06.600]  Thanks, Andrew.
[10:07.340 --> 10:07.660]  Pause?
[10:08.800 --> 10:09.820]  Okay, let's pause.
[10:10.000 --> 10:10.780]  Like, what is this?
[10:11.040 --> 10:11.340]  Protest.
[10:12.280 --> 10:12.720]  Protest.
[10:13.480 --> 10:14.360]  Under protest.
[10:14.920 --> 10:15.360]  Protest.
[10:16.200 --> 10:16.560]  Ridiculous.
[10:17.080 --> 10:18.780]  That's not a helpful suggestion.
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.060]  Well, I was gonna play, and then I...
[10:21.060 --> 10:23.120]  There's obviously a lot of Rockstar games.
[10:23.500 --> 10:24.300]  Oh my god.
[10:24.660 --> 10:27.920]  I thought there were not that many, and then you said there were a lot, so I said pause.
[10:28.200 --> 10:33.740]  I still think people only care about a select few, but I'm happy passing on this.
[10:33.800 --> 10:36.040]  It's passed, and it's going to Nick and Eric.
[10:37.380 --> 10:37.780]  Protest.
[10:38.100 --> 10:38.580]  All right, Eric.
[10:38.800 --> 10:39.460]  We can do this.
[10:39.880 --> 10:41.120]  You guys did so good last time.
[10:41.300 --> 10:43.660]  GTA V is the number five answer.
[10:44.140 --> 10:45.640]  Are V and Online the same game?
[10:46.140 --> 10:46.440]  Yes.
[10:46.980 --> 10:50.360]  Okay, then GTA V is just spot in at V, and let's move on.
[10:50.680 --> 10:52.180]  GTA V is the number one answer.
[10:53.160 --> 10:53.780]  Red Dead 2 next.
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.620]  Yeah, Red Dead 2 is definitely next.
[10:56.220 --> 10:57.940]  Red Dead 2 is next?
[10:58.120 --> 10:58.880]  Go ahead, yeah.
[10:59.120 --> 11:00.640]  And then, Nick, Red Dead 1?
[11:00.680 --> 11:01.060]  Red Dead.
[11:01.200 --> 11:01.860]  Yeah, Red Dead 1.
[11:03.620 --> 11:07.420]  Now, Red Dead 1 is the second least.
[11:07.680 --> 11:08.180]  Oh, wow.
[11:08.560 --> 11:10.840]  Okay, so is it 4 or Vice City?
[11:10.960 --> 11:13.240]  Because they're both on the list, but which one do you think is higher?
[11:13.740 --> 11:14.380]  Vice City is higher.
[11:14.480 --> 11:15.380]  Okay, so Vice City.
[11:15.680 --> 11:17.140]  Which Red Dead is Red Dead 1?
[11:17.740 --> 11:18.940]  Red Dead Redemption.
[11:19.600 --> 11:20.400]  Not Revolver.
[11:20.560 --> 11:21.180]  Write that then.
[11:21.220 --> 11:21.960]  Not Revolver.
[11:22.280 --> 11:23.580]  Oh, yeah, it could be Revolver.
[11:23.940 --> 11:24.040]  Yeah.
[11:24.160 --> 11:25.580]  You can protest too if you want to, Gavin.
[11:26.120 --> 11:27.300]  Halo 3 ODST.
[11:29.500 --> 11:34.020]  Halo 3 ODST 117 Red Dead Redemption.
[11:37.800 --> 11:39.800]  All right, Vice City.
[11:39.960 --> 11:40.560]  Vice City.
[11:40.700 --> 11:43.460]  Vice City is not on the list.
[11:43.600 --> 11:44.700]  You get your first X.
[11:45.140 --> 11:45.680]  Oh, really?
[11:45.880 --> 11:46.120]  You're wrong.
[11:46.600 --> 11:47.100]  Oh, wow.
[11:47.400 --> 11:48.700]  Okay, so GTA 4.
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.920]  GTA 4, you're locking in that?
[11:51.580 --> 11:52.000]  Yeah, right?
[11:52.280 --> 11:52.500]  Yes.
[11:52.660 --> 11:56.400]  Okay, GTA 4 is the least popular.
[11:56.920 --> 11:57.960]  You're missing one.
[11:58.300 --> 11:59.680]  You think Bully is going to be number three?
[11:59.820 --> 12:01.600]  No, I don't think it's going to be that high.
[12:01.700 --> 12:02.080]  Do you?
[12:02.480 --> 12:03.280]  I don't know.
[12:03.280 --> 12:05.600]  I think it's got to be San Andreas if it's going to be one of them.
[12:06.300 --> 12:08.560]  Unless you think it's something like Max Payne 3,
[12:08.680 --> 12:11.700]  but I just don't think that many people are going to answer Max Payne 3.
[12:12.280 --> 12:12.700]  Table tennis.
[12:14.440 --> 12:16.620]  What's the fucking, what's the car one?
[12:16.900 --> 12:18.220]  Midnight Club Racing.
[12:18.220 --> 12:18.680]  What?
[12:23.220 --> 12:28.240]  Are the DLCs separate or are they part of the thing?
[12:28.360 --> 12:29.580]  No, part of the thing.
[12:29.680 --> 12:29.820]  Okay.
[12:31.940 --> 12:35.320]  I think it's got to be San Andreas, man, I don't know.
[12:35.480 --> 12:38.180]  Yeah, I'd lean towards San Andreas, although 3 was really good.
[12:38.400 --> 12:41.640]  Yeah, but I just don't know age-wise if that's where it's going to land.
[12:42.260 --> 12:43.140]  Let's do San Andreas.
[12:43.680 --> 12:44.420]  GTA London.
[12:45.140 --> 12:47.980]  San Andreas was their guess.
[12:48.220 --> 12:49.280]  Yeah, go ahead.
[12:49.400 --> 12:51.360]  San Andreas is not the right answer.
[12:51.540 --> 12:53.100]  That's two Xs.
[12:53.500 --> 12:53.840]  Wow.
[12:54.440 --> 12:56.440]  You have one more attempt to figure out.
[12:56.560 --> 12:58.640]  What are the Xs denoted on this?
[12:58.860 --> 12:59.320]  Yeah, that's good.
[13:00.060 --> 13:02.640]  That's actually a really good question, Gavin.
[13:02.740 --> 13:05.280]  I kind of want to, because I forgot we had one, Andrew.
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.340]  Oh, you did?
[13:06.440 --> 13:08.420]  Okay, well, you know, there you go.
[13:08.520 --> 13:08.780]  X, X.
[13:08.800 --> 13:10.060]  Why would you do that?
[13:10.100 --> 13:11.000]  That looks like our score.
[13:11.600 --> 13:13.060]  Yeah, oh, you wanted it?
[13:13.120 --> 13:13.600]  There it is.
[13:14.280 --> 13:15.600]  That doesn't make any sense if you ask me.
[13:16.380 --> 13:17.840]  Do you want to go with Bully then?
[13:18.220 --> 13:20.100]  I was thinking that, but what about L.A. Noire?
[13:20.740 --> 13:22.080]  No, I don't think so.
[13:22.500 --> 13:27.780]  I think Bully is the weird loved one that like people want the sequel to so bad,
[13:27.860 --> 13:29.560]  and then they're going to get it and go, I don't want to play this.
[13:30.040 --> 13:30.920]  Did they make Manhunt?
[13:31.460 --> 13:34.400]  Yeah, but I don't know that that's going to be on this list.
[13:35.100 --> 13:35.600]  I think we just...
[13:35.600 --> 13:36.120]  Alright, fuck it, let's do Bully.
[13:36.180 --> 13:36.720]  Let's go with Bully.
[13:36.980 --> 13:37.420]  Let's go with Bully.
[13:37.840 --> 13:38.640]  People love that game.
[13:38.860 --> 13:40.060]  Their guess is Bully.
[13:40.300 --> 13:41.040]  I love Bully.
[13:41.220 --> 13:42.280]  I liked it. I thought it was fine.
[13:42.700 --> 13:43.340]  Never played it.
[13:43.600 --> 13:44.000]  Oh, really?
[13:44.080 --> 13:45.600]  Bully is the correct answer.
[13:45.680 --> 13:45.960]  Yeah!
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.840]  Ahead of Red Dead Redemption.
[13:48.360 --> 13:49.060]  That's insane.
[13:49.940 --> 13:50.820]  That's Bully.
[13:51.280 --> 13:53.620]  People are remembering that game more fondly than...
[13:54.480 --> 13:55.780]  A hundred percent.
[13:55.860 --> 13:57.100]  They like that better than GTA?
[13:57.720 --> 13:57.960]  Yeah.
[13:58.120 --> 13:58.700]  Vice City?
[13:59.060 --> 13:59.200]  Yeah.
[13:59.720 --> 14:01.360]  And San Andreas?
[14:01.900 --> 14:03.480]  Yeah, like they don't know that...
[14:03.480 --> 14:04.100]  And 4?
[14:04.860 --> 14:06.580]  Yeah, the fact that they're getting like left behind.
[14:06.680 --> 14:08.500]  They like it more than Red Dead Redemption 1.
[14:08.840 --> 14:09.620]  That's insane.
[14:09.920 --> 14:10.040]  That's nuts.
[14:10.160 --> 14:13.500]  Dude, the fucking Lost in the Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.940]  are like some of the best video game content ever made.
[14:15.940 --> 14:18.420]  Ballad of Gay Tony is amazing.
[14:18.680 --> 14:21.280]  Hey, The Warriors is better than Bully.
[14:21.600 --> 14:22.220]  Great game.
[14:22.600 --> 14:23.560]  Oh, yeah.
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.420]  After two rounds of this game, Team Nick and Eric leading by 30.
[14:29.760 --> 14:31.460]  I don't think it was called Bully in England.
[14:31.960 --> 14:33.420]  What was it called? Like...
[14:33.420 --> 14:35.820]  I don't remember. I think it had some like Latin name.
[14:36.140 --> 14:37.140]  It was School Doe.
[14:37.440 --> 14:37.620]  What?
[14:38.460 --> 14:39.540]  It was what?
[14:40.500 --> 14:42.420]  Like Clue is called Clue Doe.
[14:42.740 --> 14:43.900]  School Doe?
[14:44.480 --> 14:46.640]  I believe it was Bully 117.
[14:46.860 --> 14:52.380]  Let's move to the next decider category, which will be between Gavin and Nick.
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.520]  How much money domestically the highest grossing film released in the summer of 98 make?
[14:59.020 --> 15:00.060]  Oh, for...
[15:00.060 --> 15:00.640]  Oh, my God.
[15:01.140 --> 15:01.700]  Bucks.
[15:02.000 --> 15:02.260]  Eight.
[15:03.420 --> 15:03.980]  Domestically.
[15:04.280 --> 15:04.580]  98.
[15:04.740 --> 15:05.220]  Domestically.
[15:06.120 --> 15:07.520]  That's a crazy one.
[15:07.640 --> 15:09.580]  I'm very bad at money.
[15:09.940 --> 15:11.000]  Yeah, that's fine.
[15:11.080 --> 15:11.200]  Yeah.
[15:11.600 --> 15:12.140]  I trust you.
[15:12.670 --> 15:15.040]  Also, this is all under protest, so it doesn't matter.
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.260]  Yeah, you're right. You know what?
[15:16.540 --> 15:16.820]  Exactly.
[15:16.960 --> 15:17.680]  That's what you have to do.
[15:17.780 --> 15:22.320]  Release yourself from doubt and just know that this is all under protest, so it doesn't matter.
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.780]  When they submit me their guesses, we will advance.
[15:29.120 --> 15:31.740]  I wanted that Slack message to pop up so bad just now.
[15:34.480 --> 15:35.240]  I don't...
[15:35.240 --> 15:36.540]  I seriously have no idea about this.
[15:36.740 --> 15:37.580]  You just pick one, man.
[15:37.920 --> 15:39.360]  I did.
[15:39.380 --> 15:39.900]  Pick that one.
[15:40.900 --> 15:41.780]  It's probably not good.
[15:42.360 --> 15:43.340]  What year was...
[15:46.460 --> 15:48.320]  We did a whole movie draft.
[15:48.980 --> 15:52.580]  300. So the film... I now have the answers for both people.
[15:52.940 --> 15:54.540]  Film is Saving Private Ryan.
[15:55.160 --> 15:56.120]  Is one of the answers 300?
[15:57.520 --> 15:57.760]  Oh.
[15:58.400 --> 15:59.140]  What happened?
[16:00.120 --> 16:00.360]  What?
[16:01.620 --> 16:02.060]  What?
[16:02.640 --> 16:03.580]  Did it pop up?
[16:04.220 --> 16:06.220]  No, you said it out loud.
[16:06.240 --> 16:08.080]  You said it when I typed it.
[16:08.320 --> 16:10.320]  You said it out loud. You said 300.
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.000]  You said the words 300 out loud.
[16:15.040 --> 16:15.960]  I don't remember that.
[16:16.720 --> 16:19.800]  Andrew, how else would I have known to say that?
[16:20.220 --> 16:23.760]  That is... that is why I was baffled, Eric.
[16:23.920 --> 16:28.560]  I was... because it popped up on my screen and I just had zero awareness that I had verbally,
[16:28.780 --> 16:30.040]  vocally said it.
[16:30.300 --> 16:31.580]  I was like, how did he...
[16:31.580 --> 16:34.560]  So it doesn't matter if we hide the Slack messages.
[16:34.780 --> 16:36.420]  You're just going to say them.
[16:36.720 --> 16:37.700]  I didn't even hear it.
[16:37.800 --> 16:38.100]  Fuck.
[16:38.100 --> 16:41.780]  So if I type something to you right now, do you just say it?
[16:43.500 --> 16:43.820]  Uh, nope.
[16:44.400 --> 16:44.960]  Nope.
[16:46.080 --> 16:46.920]  Gavin guessed...
[16:47.820 --> 16:49.040]  Gavin guessed 300.
[16:49.480 --> 16:49.880]  Oh, yeah?
[16:50.160 --> 16:50.900]  No, you don't say it.
[16:52.440 --> 16:55.600]  Nick guessed 90 million.
[16:56.480 --> 16:57.800]  More power than that, Nick.
[16:58.080 --> 17:04.140]  The correct answer is 216,540,000 dollars.
[17:05.060 --> 17:06.600]  Geoff and Gavin win.
[17:07.020 --> 17:07.280]  Ow.
[17:07.360 --> 17:07.780]  Hell yeah.
[17:07.780 --> 17:08.680]  Your round.
[17:09.140 --> 17:11.700]  We're not doing like, oh, like closest without going over?
[17:12.020 --> 17:14.360]  No, it's just whoever's closest is not under.
[17:14.660 --> 17:16.280]  Wow, that's some bullshit.
[17:16.780 --> 17:19.840]  Yeah, that sounds like a made up rule all of a sudden.
[17:19.920 --> 17:21.060]  It's under, it's all under protest.
[17:21.120 --> 17:21.700]  It doesn't matter.
[17:22.020 --> 17:23.280]  Best gaming system.
[17:23.840 --> 17:24.860]  Oh, there's a lot of these.
[17:25.180 --> 17:26.200]  Doesn't have to be console.
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.860]  It could be anything that you play games on.
[17:28.260 --> 17:29.380]  Oh, we got to play this one, right?
[17:29.480 --> 17:30.200]  Let's do it.
[17:30.600 --> 17:30.880]  All right.
[17:31.280 --> 17:31.560]  All right.
[17:31.620 --> 17:36.700]  Geoff and Gavin are playing best gaming system.
[17:38.260 --> 17:39.660]  I sent Andrew a message.
[17:39.800 --> 17:40.900]  I want to see you write it out loud.
[17:41.100 --> 17:42.180]  We're going to ruin this.
[17:42.940 --> 17:44.940]  Should we go with a personal computer?
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.180]  Gavin would be the first one.
[17:46.700 --> 17:47.560]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[17:47.740 --> 17:49.280]  Well, I would say a PS2.
[17:50.660 --> 17:51.500]  Let's do that.
[17:53.660 --> 17:55.040]  PS2 is their guess.
[17:55.680 --> 17:58.320]  PS2 is the number two answer.
[17:59.880 --> 18:00.320]  PS2.
[18:00.500 --> 18:03.040]  Gavin with no confidence in Geoff's answer.
[18:04.100 --> 18:06.420]  I was just discussing both things we thought of.
[18:06.440 --> 18:07.220]  Let's go with Geoff's.
[18:08.360 --> 18:14.280]  Okay, I'd somehow less enthusiastically like to say personal computer.
[18:15.580 --> 18:21.500]  Geoff less enthusiastically says PC is the number four second most popular answer.
[18:21.820 --> 18:22.180]  PC.
[18:23.120 --> 18:28.480]  Now, how with Xbox, how is it just going to be on there?
[18:28.740 --> 18:30.380]  Well, I don't know.
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.580]  And which Nintendo?
[18:32.340 --> 18:33.860]  Would people put the Game Boy?
[18:34.860 --> 18:35.260]  Hmm.
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.900]  No, no, no.
[18:38.160 --> 18:39.520]  But will the Switch be on there?
[18:40.720 --> 18:42.400]  Oh, I wish we hadn't done this.
[18:43.980 --> 18:45.840]  Yeah, there's a lot of different...
[18:45.840 --> 18:47.900]  Are you talking about this question or the whole game show?
[18:48.700 --> 18:50.940]  PS5, I would say probably is up there, right?
[18:52.200 --> 18:52.980]  Wouldn't you think?
[18:53.540 --> 18:54.220]  I feel good, Eric.
[18:54.580 --> 18:55.300]  The Footrest?
[18:55.520 --> 18:56.700]  You think it's one of the best games?
[18:57.320 --> 18:58.920]  I think it's very popular.
[18:59.480 --> 19:02.760]  It's the hot one right now all the kids are into.
[19:03.860 --> 19:04.640]  Go for it.
[19:05.400 --> 19:06.400]  No, I...
[19:07.120 --> 19:08.380]  No, you go.
[19:08.500 --> 19:09.600]  Super Nintendo, would that be on there?
[19:09.920 --> 19:10.620]  How old is...
[19:10.620 --> 19:11.760]  Gavin said Super Nintendo.
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.560]  It's like, put it on the board!
[19:14.360 --> 19:16.220]  Their guess is Super Nintendo.
[19:17.220 --> 19:22.040]  Super Nintendo is not one of the consoles or machines.
[19:22.540 --> 19:24.140]  Gavin, do you call it a SNES?
[19:24.780 --> 19:25.440]  Yeah, SNES.
[19:26.360 --> 19:26.860]  Weird.
[19:27.400 --> 19:27.900]  1X.
[19:28.300 --> 19:29.800]  All right, well, I'm going to go with PS5.
[19:30.560 --> 19:30.920]  Go for it.
[19:31.060 --> 19:31.540]  Jaguar.
[19:32.260 --> 19:34.180]  Geoff is saying PS5.
[19:35.300 --> 19:36.960]  PS5 is the least popular.
[19:37.120 --> 19:37.920]  Correct answer.
[19:38.120 --> 19:38.880]  That's good.
[19:39.440 --> 19:40.920]  What? It's under PS2?
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.200]  Get the fuck out of here.
[19:43.080 --> 19:43.980]  Nick is outraged.
[19:44.180 --> 19:45.180]  Audience is angered, Nick.
[19:45.600 --> 19:47.720]  I mean, PS5 should not be on this list.
[19:47.880 --> 19:48.320]  Yeah, probably.
[19:48.960 --> 19:49.960]  PS2 shouldn't be on this list.
[19:50.060 --> 19:50.800]  What the fuck was on that?
[19:50.820 --> 19:52.700]  PS2 is like the best selling console of all time.
[19:52.940 --> 19:54.700]  Yeah, but all the games on it suck.
[19:54.960 --> 19:56.100]  It's just banger after...
[19:56.100 --> 19:58.600]  Remember all those games that we listed in the best of Rockstar 1?
[20:01.540 --> 20:04.520]  It is probably the most, maybe not the most,
[20:04.580 --> 20:06.040]  but one of the most beloved consoles.
[20:06.200 --> 20:08.140]  And I love Nick has zero love for it.
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.540]  No, I got it for Christmas one year and I fucking hated all the games.
[20:12.960 --> 20:13.440]  What?
[20:13.680 --> 20:16.120]  You just hated gaming for like a year.
[20:16.320 --> 20:16.900]  On the PS2?
[20:17.240 --> 20:19.000]  There's like thousands of games.
[20:19.060 --> 20:20.420]  It came with Arbor Core 2.
[20:20.620 --> 20:21.420]  I fucking hated it.
[20:22.660 --> 20:25.540]  What an insane game to judge the console by.
[20:25.900 --> 20:28.600]  Yeah, that's all trash after that.
[20:29.080 --> 20:30.860]  If Nintendo's represented, Gavin,
[20:30.860 --> 20:32.640]  do you think it's going to be the 64?
[20:33.620 --> 20:35.000]  Or the Switch?
[20:35.340 --> 20:36.560]  It wouldn't be the Wii, right?
[20:36.680 --> 20:38.060]  Like nobody really liked the Wii.
[20:38.480 --> 20:40.580]  GameCube wasn't big enough.
[20:40.800 --> 20:42.220]  Wii U, GameCube...
[20:43.360 --> 20:44.380]  NES, I guess.
[20:44.940 --> 20:46.480]  This all seems pretty recent though.
[20:46.600 --> 20:47.860]  Should we just go Switch?
[20:49.020 --> 20:49.460]  Switch!
[20:50.500 --> 20:51.920]  Switch is their guess.
[20:52.740 --> 20:53.980]  Switch is incorrect.
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.860]  That is your second X.
[20:58.800 --> 21:01.260]  No Switch, but PS5.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.260]  And PS2.
[21:02.340 --> 21:03.420]  I'm going to say N64.
[21:03.580 --> 21:05.840]  If PS2's on there, N64's got to be on there, right?
[21:06.240 --> 21:07.280]  More than PS1?
[21:10.580 --> 21:12.740]  Okay, I'm going to let you make the last pick.
[21:12.820 --> 21:14.020]  I just, I don't know.
[21:14.320 --> 21:14.860]  No, no, no, no.
[21:15.160 --> 21:16.260]  I've been wrong twice.
[21:16.480 --> 21:17.140]  I've been wrong twice.
[21:17.520 --> 21:18.120]  Let's go with yours.
[21:18.520 --> 21:18.920]  I just...
[21:20.200 --> 21:22.200]  Look, two PlayStations are already on there.
[21:22.280 --> 21:25.480]  I feel like the PS2 might cannibalize the PS1.
[21:25.480 --> 21:27.640]  I don't think Xbox is going to be there.
[21:27.860 --> 21:30.920]  I'm going to say N64.
[21:39.240 --> 21:41.300]  Geoff's guess is N64.
[21:44.560 --> 21:45.760]  It's not on there.
[21:47.040 --> 21:48.080]  Three X's.
[21:48.540 --> 21:52.000]  It goes to Team Nick and Eric with the chance to steal.
[21:52.360 --> 21:53.240]  I failed you, Gavin.
[21:53.340 --> 21:53.880]  I'm so sorry.
[21:54.380 --> 21:55.020]  Hey, no worries.
[21:55.020 --> 21:56.940]  It's got to be Xbox 360, right, Nick?
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.060]  Not a question.
[21:58.300 --> 21:58.700]  360.
[21:59.180 --> 22:00.980]  Xbox 360 is their guess.
[22:01.920 --> 22:07.460]  Xbox 360 is the most popular answer to the survey.
[22:07.620 --> 22:09.100]  Geoff, know your audience.
[22:09.880 --> 22:14.720]  I've been being told the Xbox sucks my entire professional career by my audience.
[22:15.080 --> 22:19.260]  Xbox 360 was like the only Xbox console I respect.
[22:19.520 --> 22:21.240]  It was unstoppable.
[22:21.900 --> 22:22.580]  Unstoppable.
[22:22.580 --> 22:27.960]  I have like four friends that love the Xbox and everybody else just dumped on us for the
[22:27.960 --> 22:29.920]  fucking all day, every day.
[22:30.140 --> 22:34.000]  Yeah, I just thought Xbox was supremely unpopular compared to PlayStation.
[22:34.540 --> 22:38.020]  I mean, you think about the history of Let's Play and...
[22:38.020 --> 22:39.700]  Xbox 360 won that generation, man.
[22:39.940 --> 22:40.840]  It destroyed.
[22:42.740 --> 22:44.600]  I mean, online multiplayer was insane.
[22:44.740 --> 22:47.120]  Yeah, crushed, crushed, crushed, crushed.
[22:47.400 --> 22:50.120]  And to Nick, most of all, it wasn't a PS2.
[22:50.120 --> 22:53.820]  The missing answer to this question...
[22:53.820 --> 22:56.540]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, not for points, but can I guess?
[22:56.620 --> 22:57.280]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[22:57.620 --> 22:58.460]  Is it GameCube?
[22:58.760 --> 23:01.560]  It is not. There are zero Nintendo consoles.
[23:01.920 --> 23:01.940]  Wow.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.200]  Is it PS4 then?
[23:03.720 --> 23:04.720]  It is not PS4.
[23:04.980 --> 23:06.360]  It's the original PlayStation, right?
[23:06.620 --> 23:07.620]  It's not PS1.
[23:08.220 --> 23:11.440]  Nobody was going to fill out this board, apparently, regardless of what side it went.
[23:11.760 --> 23:14.360]  The missing answer is the original Xbox.
[23:14.820 --> 23:15.800]  Oh, what?
[23:16.040 --> 23:17.820]  Come on, no one bought that.
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.940]  That was just me that had one of those.
[23:20.420 --> 23:21.620]  I had one of those.
[23:21.780 --> 23:23.660]  Even I didn't like the original Xbox.
[23:24.140 --> 23:26.100]  If I retract everything I said, these people are nuts.
[23:26.560 --> 23:27.700]  They had a hard drive in it, though.
[23:28.280 --> 23:29.880]  I had so many blocks I could save.
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.020]  It's true, you devil.
[23:33.360 --> 23:34.900]  We did have the option to save blocks.
[23:35.440 --> 23:36.580]  The worst controller.
[23:36.940 --> 23:37.160]  We didn't know what that meant.
[23:37.340 --> 23:39.040]  The worst controller.
[23:39.560 --> 23:41.600]  No, no, and 64 is so much worse.
[23:41.680 --> 23:41.820]  No.
[23:42.260 --> 23:44.440]  Wait, you think the original Xbox is the worst controller?
[23:44.660 --> 23:45.500]  No way, the Duke?
[23:45.700 --> 23:46.200]  You're an idiot.
[23:46.540 --> 23:47.000]  I hate it.
[23:47.000 --> 23:47.820]  You're an idiot.
[23:48.040 --> 23:48.620]  I hate it.
[23:48.620 --> 23:51.360]  The size of it, I hated it.
[23:51.500 --> 23:52.020]  I hated it.
[23:52.100 --> 23:54.180]  The original PlayStation DualShock is the worst.
[23:54.320 --> 23:57.220]  Oh, that's a flimsy dog shit controller, too.
[23:57.400 --> 23:58.920]  That's a totally fine controller.
[23:59.260 --> 24:01.480]  How's that worse than the one that didn't have the analog stick?
[24:01.800 --> 24:02.340]  They both suck.
[24:02.340 --> 24:02.860]  He's got you there.
[24:03.060 --> 24:03.580]  It's true.
[24:04.000 --> 24:04.760]  Next question.
[24:04.760 --> 24:06.240]  Two things can suck at the same time.
[24:06.820 --> 24:07.060]  Yeah.
[24:07.460 --> 24:08.880]  This is Geoff and Eric.
[24:09.300 --> 24:12.300]  How many career homers did Billy Ripken hit?
[24:12.840 --> 24:14.440]  Oh, okay.
[24:15.360 --> 24:16.400]  Let me...
[24:16.400 --> 24:17.240]  Are we slacking you?
[24:17.240 --> 24:19.080]  Slack you that answer, I guess.
[24:19.540 --> 24:22.060]  You two can slack me when you feel you have an answer.
[24:24.460 --> 24:26.560]  I have a feeling I know what Eric's is.
[24:28.020 --> 24:30.220]  No, I'm not going to do the funniest thing of all time.
[24:30.300 --> 24:31.400]  That is crazy.
[24:31.840 --> 24:34.980]  I gave you a real answer.
[24:35.400 --> 24:36.440]  Okay, I went.
[24:36.560 --> 24:36.820]  I went.
[24:36.920 --> 24:37.280]  I did it.
[24:37.320 --> 24:37.720]  I said it.
[24:38.080 --> 24:38.920]  Okay, I got two...
[24:39.920 --> 24:41.520]  I got three messages.
[24:42.140 --> 24:42.440]  Okay.
[24:42.720 --> 24:44.200]  Two of them related to the...
[24:44.200 --> 24:45.160]  What's the other one say?
[24:46.040 --> 24:46.400]  Grapes.
[24:47.240 --> 24:48.160]  That was from Gavin.
[24:48.460 --> 24:49.220]  Gavin sent me grapes.
[24:49.740 --> 24:50.900]  I'm just trying to be confusing.
[24:51.620 --> 24:52.920]  We went to...
[24:53.620 --> 24:56.180]  We went to two opposite sides of this.
[24:56.320 --> 24:58.560]  We went a big number and a low number.
[24:59.620 --> 25:02.740]  Geoff guessed 186.
[25:02.940 --> 25:04.360]  You're insane.
[25:05.800 --> 25:08.220]  Eric guessed 22.
[25:10.160 --> 25:13.180]  The correct answer is 20.
[25:13.560 --> 25:14.700]  Yeah, Eric wins.
[25:14.700 --> 25:17.280]  No way it was more than 15.
[25:17.680 --> 25:20.240]  I thought about, like, his career.
[25:20.680 --> 25:23.720]  He's a base hit guy, I guess.
[25:24.640 --> 25:26.860]  Zero power for a hitter.
[25:27.120 --> 25:27.460]  Nuts.
[25:27.860 --> 25:29.120]  Well, I only know him because he wrote...
[25:29.520 --> 25:34.520]  That leads us to the question.
[25:35.520 --> 25:37.240]  What's your favorite color?
[25:37.820 --> 25:39.440]  This is the dumbest fucking game.
[25:39.660 --> 25:40.540]  This is so dumb.
[25:40.540 --> 25:41.220]  Andrew.
[25:42.060 --> 25:45.160]  This is submitted, obviously, by our community.
[25:45.460 --> 25:47.100]  All the regulation listeners, comment leavers.
[25:47.200 --> 25:48.000]  I guess they'd be comment leavers.
[25:48.360 --> 25:49.420]  Yeah, we should...
[25:49.420 --> 25:50.900]  We should pass on this, right?
[25:51.140 --> 25:52.860]  Punt that shit in the second half, baby.
[25:52.880 --> 25:53.880]  Yeah, yeah, we're going to pass.
[25:53.940 --> 25:54.760]  We're going to give it to them.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.480]  Nick and Eric are passing to Geoff and Gavin.
[25:58.120 --> 26:00.240]  What is our community's favorite color?
[26:01.360 --> 26:01.760]  Okay.
[26:05.040 --> 26:06.300]  That is the correct response.
[26:06.540 --> 26:06.760]  Blue.
[26:10.140 --> 26:11.340]  Geoff is guessing blue.
[26:12.400 --> 26:13.940]  Oh my god.
[26:14.260 --> 26:15.620]  Blue is the number one answer.
[26:16.160 --> 26:16.680]  Wow.
[26:17.600 --> 26:18.420]  That's awesome.
[26:18.620 --> 26:20.460]  Gav, you got any guesses?
[26:25.980 --> 26:26.500]  Green.
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.160]  Green is Gavin's guess.
[26:30.980 --> 26:33.840]  Green is the second most popular answer.
[26:36.300 --> 26:37.540]  Run the board, guys.
[26:37.800 --> 26:38.240]  Run the board.
[26:38.340 --> 26:38.880]  Get them in order.
[26:40.760 --> 26:41.320]  Three, two, one.
[26:41.340 --> 26:41.840]  Three available.
[26:42.420 --> 26:44.200]  So far, you two are in sequence.
[26:45.080 --> 26:45.500]  Red.
[26:49.060 --> 26:50.760]  Geoff is guessing red.
[26:51.020 --> 26:52.600]  Why do people listen to this?
[26:53.040 --> 26:53.600]  Red.
[26:53.840 --> 26:55.380]  We're just guessing colors.
[26:55.960 --> 26:58.000]  Well, you gotta think about the audience and what they feel.
[26:58.120 --> 26:58.920]  What's in their hearts.
[26:59.160 --> 27:00.840]  And red is in their heart.
[27:01.860 --> 27:03.540]  The number two spot.
[27:03.840 --> 27:04.580]  Oh, damn.
[27:04.940 --> 27:05.280]  Red.
[27:07.320 --> 27:08.900]  You're missing two.
[27:09.540 --> 27:10.300]  Three and one.
[27:11.560 --> 27:11.960]  Two.
[27:14.600 --> 27:15.620]  You're up, Gav.
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.740]  I mean, you don't need to rotate.
[27:18.400 --> 27:19.920]  Someone has color confidence.
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.840]  I don't think a lot of people like yellow.
[27:23.320 --> 27:24.160]  Would that be on there?
[27:24.780 --> 27:27.080]  Well, you gotta think of all the piss rats in the chat.
[27:28.080 --> 27:29.140]  There's a lot of piss rats.
[27:29.920 --> 27:30.560]  Yellow is just...
[27:31.280 --> 27:32.380]  It's kind of minging, right?
[27:32.860 --> 27:33.320]  Bit of minging.
[27:34.100 --> 27:35.220]  You think people would say orange?
[27:35.720 --> 27:37.600]  Or is that too obscure of a color?
[27:38.020 --> 27:39.940]  And then do we get into gold and stuff?
[27:40.020 --> 27:40.840]  Like, is that a different color?
[27:40.840 --> 27:42.740]  What about white and black?
[27:42.860 --> 27:43.760]  Are they even colors?
[27:44.420 --> 27:45.080]  Are we all...
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.040]  They wouldn't be...
[27:46.040 --> 27:46.880]  Are they...
[27:46.880 --> 27:47.680]  Well, black isn't.
[27:47.840 --> 27:49.560]  White is everything, right?
[27:49.820 --> 27:50.100]  Yeah.
[27:50.440 --> 27:51.980]  Well, if it's paint, it's black, I suppose.
[27:52.360 --> 27:54.260]  Just to help you a little bit with this.
[27:54.420 --> 27:55.780]  Oh, that's good, man.
[27:55.820 --> 27:56.740]  I'm so glad you're helping.
[27:56.940 --> 27:58.760]  Not helping, just explaining it.
[27:58.880 --> 28:00.280]  This would be the exact same clarification.
[28:01.260 --> 28:04.840]  This is a survey in which people inputted whatever they wanted to.
[28:05.420 --> 28:09.420]  So if you think that something isn't a color, but they might think it is,
[28:09.940 --> 28:10.740]  you could guess that.
[28:11.380 --> 28:12.180]  Cadmium yellow.
[28:12.960 --> 28:13.760]  Oh, God.
[28:14.240 --> 28:15.040]  Is that your guess?
[28:15.360 --> 28:15.700]  No.
[28:17.440 --> 28:18.600]  Just wanted to make sure.
[28:19.280 --> 28:20.660]  They could put anything in.
[28:20.780 --> 28:21.720]  Real good so far.
[28:22.280 --> 28:27.200]  So that means what Andrew is telling us there is the black or white is on there.
[28:27.520 --> 28:29.460]  Yeah, they definitely picked black, right?
[28:29.660 --> 28:30.780]  Yeah, dude, thanks for helping, Andrew.
[28:30.860 --> 28:31.380]  That's so cool.
[28:31.700 --> 28:32.600]  But he wasn't helping.
[28:32.900 --> 28:33.500]  Uh-huh, right.
[28:33.540 --> 28:35.200]  He used the word, but I agree, yeah.
[28:35.580 --> 28:36.560]  Is that your guess, black?
[28:38.700 --> 28:39.880]  Is that your official guess?
[28:39.880 --> 28:41.340]  I think it should be.
[28:42.000 --> 28:42.780]  Yeah, why not?
[28:43.380 --> 28:44.720]  Black is the guess.
[28:45.420 --> 28:46.640]  Black is not on the board.
[28:46.900 --> 28:47.120]  Okay.
[28:47.840 --> 28:48.280]  Interesting.
[28:48.820 --> 28:49.160]  All right.
[28:49.220 --> 28:50.520]  Maybe he was anti-helping.
[28:50.940 --> 28:51.380]  Protest.
[28:51.700 --> 28:53.780]  I was just clarifying how these were submitted.
[28:54.340 --> 28:55.340]  You think people say purple?
[28:55.840 --> 28:57.300]  That's my daughter's favorite color.
[28:58.120 --> 28:59.780]  People could have typed gurple.
[29:00.240 --> 29:00.660]  Oh.
[29:03.140 --> 29:04.500]  Only one way to find out.
[29:05.100 --> 29:06.000]  Yeah, go, go, go.
[29:07.960 --> 29:09.840]  I wonder if...
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.560]  regulation listeners, what their favorite color is.
[29:12.980 --> 29:15.540]  How many of them would have been funny enough to write gurple?
[29:15.740 --> 29:16.760]  Hopefully enough.
[29:17.240 --> 29:20.600]  The question is, do we go for gurple before we go to purple?
[29:22.880 --> 29:24.400]  What was the poll number, Andrew?
[29:24.920 --> 29:26.660]  Sorry, what was the question, Nick?
[29:27.020 --> 29:27.740]  What was the poll number?
[29:27.780 --> 29:28.200]  How many people?
[29:28.700 --> 29:30.240]  I don't have that information.
[29:30.500 --> 29:30.760]  Thousands.
[29:31.600 --> 29:32.000]  Thousands?
[29:32.700 --> 29:33.180]  Thousands.
[29:33.880 --> 29:34.240]  Shit.
[29:35.680 --> 29:37.720]  I mean, we got to be funny, right?
[29:38.080 --> 29:40.740]  At some point in this video, somebody's got to be funny.
[29:40.880 --> 29:41.720]  Let's go with gurple.
[29:42.900 --> 29:44.140]  Gurple is their guess.
[29:44.700 --> 29:45.660]  Gurple is incorrect.
[29:46.020 --> 29:46.820]  Not even mad.
[29:47.420 --> 29:48.420]  I actually, I am mad.
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.400]  I'm disappointed in the audience.
[29:51.480 --> 29:52.300]  I'm not even mad.
[29:52.460 --> 29:53.200]  Well, I'm not mad at me.
[29:53.240 --> 29:53.680]  I'm mad at you.
[29:53.860 --> 29:54.760]  Really let us down.
[29:55.400 --> 29:56.980]  No black, no gurple.
[29:57.880 --> 29:58.240]  Pink?
[29:58.740 --> 29:59.200]  Nah, it's not.
[29:59.200 --> 29:59.400]  Nah.
[30:00.100 --> 30:00.820]  Are you scared?
[30:00.920 --> 30:02.120]  Are we scared off of purple now?
[30:02.160 --> 30:02.840]  I feel like we are.
[30:03.700 --> 30:04.920]  Yellow's still got to be in the mix.
[30:05.000 --> 30:05.980]  It is a primary color.
[30:07.020 --> 30:08.300]  Yeah, do we want a yellow?
[30:08.920 --> 30:12.820]  I mean, I'm gonna let you pick because I thought I picked gurple and look what it got us.
[30:13.440 --> 30:14.060]  Also black.
[30:14.180 --> 30:14.600]  I picked black.
[30:14.720 --> 30:15.520]  Jesus Christ.
[30:20.240 --> 30:23.440]  Okay, Geoff, does your gut say purple, white, or yellow?
[30:24.660 --> 30:26.420]  My gut says yellow.
[30:27.060 --> 30:27.460]  Yellow!
[30:28.480 --> 30:29.780]  That just makes me pick it.
[30:32.840 --> 30:34.260]  Yellow is their guess.
[30:35.080 --> 30:36.640]  Yellow is not on the board.
[30:36.800 --> 30:38.180]  That is three X's.
[30:38.320 --> 30:40.440]  It goes to team Nick and Eric.
[30:40.660 --> 30:41.420]  Son of a bitch.
[30:42.180 --> 30:43.700]  Hey, Gav, you don't have to worry about it.
[30:43.800 --> 30:45.440]  This episode's under protest.
[30:45.660 --> 30:46.240]  It doesn't even count.
[30:46.640 --> 30:47.180]  I'm telling you.
[30:47.240 --> 30:48.580]  See, now you guys are getting it.
[30:48.640 --> 30:50.620]  Now you guys are finally understanding what I'm laying down.
[30:50.980 --> 30:51.640]  We're not actually.
[30:51.780 --> 30:52.880]  We're still up one to nothing.
[30:53.000 --> 30:53.940]  This one doesn't count.
[30:54.300 --> 30:56.560]  Nick and Eric, what is a favorite color?
[30:56.920 --> 30:58.120]  Well, here's the thing.
[30:58.160 --> 31:03.680]  Nick, I think that orange being up there is probably pretty good.
[31:03.680 --> 31:06.220]  But white feels like it might be on the list.
[31:06.300 --> 31:08.320]  But if black's not, then maybe it's not.
[31:08.500 --> 31:09.600]  What do you like gut feeling?
[31:09.680 --> 31:10.140]  What do you think?
[31:10.760 --> 31:11.860]  I think orange is going to be on there.
[31:11.920 --> 31:12.340]  You think so?
[31:12.380 --> 31:13.120]  All right, let's go with orange.
[31:13.280 --> 31:13.720]  Let's see what happens.
[31:14.840 --> 31:18.820]  Orange, which is Geoff's favorite color, is on the list.
[31:18.940 --> 31:19.900]  It's the least popular.
[31:20.080 --> 31:23.440]  Nick and Eric steal with orange.
[31:24.020 --> 31:24.380]  Protest.
[31:25.000 --> 31:25.780]  Yeah, no, that's fine.
[31:25.940 --> 31:26.600]  Yeah, no, I agree.
[31:26.720 --> 31:26.920]  Protest.
[31:27.320 --> 31:27.940]  Yeah, absolutely.
[31:29.260 --> 31:32.160]  Any guesses as to what the missing color would be?
[31:32.440 --> 31:33.140]  Orange is a good color.
[31:33.680 --> 31:34.440]  I think it's teal.
[31:34.880 --> 31:35.680]  Nick thinks teal.
[31:35.800 --> 31:36.340]  Eric says white.
[31:36.340 --> 31:37.440]  Neither are correct.
[31:37.860 --> 31:40.000]  The missing correct answer.
[31:41.080 --> 31:41.360]  Purple.
[31:46.360 --> 31:46.800]  Shit.
[31:48.200 --> 31:48.760]  Shit.
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.240]  Well, well, well.
[31:53.720 --> 31:57.440]  Can't believe they didn't do GERPL.
[31:57.720 --> 32:01.700]  They put to put purple and not put GERPL and listen to this show is wild.
[32:02.340 --> 32:03.960]  I can't believe Geoff didn't listen to Gavin.
[32:04.540 --> 32:07.040]  GERPL was submitted 210 times.
[32:07.060 --> 32:07.880]  Wow.
[32:08.160 --> 32:10.300]  Not enough to make the list.
[32:11.220 --> 32:11.820]  Make the list.
[32:11.820 --> 32:13.820]  You 210 are the real heroes, though.
[32:13.820 --> 32:14.540]  Yep, absolutely.
[32:15.240 --> 32:16.460]  210 funny fans.
[32:17.080 --> 32:19.880]  We should use those 210 people for something.
[32:21.260 --> 32:22.540]  The next few.
[32:22.540 --> 32:24.720]  I want the next few to be only those people.
[32:26.160 --> 32:29.720]  Only the GERPL-ist of comment leavers.
[32:30.320 --> 32:33.400]  Moving into the final decider.
[32:33.400 --> 32:40.040]  How many separate attempts is Flavor Flav made to launch a chain of chicken restaurants?
[32:40.260 --> 32:40.880]  Right, Nick, this is you.
[32:42.440 --> 32:47.620]  Now, to clarify the question, this isn't how many restaurants has he had at one time.
[32:48.040 --> 32:52.700]  This is how many starting over, starting from scratch attempts.
[32:53.100 --> 32:53.980]  Like with a new name.
[32:54.460 --> 33:01.280]  Yeah, either a new variation of a name or or just all of the previous ones got shut down.
[33:01.580 --> 33:02.800]  And there's a long period of time.
[33:02.800 --> 33:04.440]  And then he started one again.
[33:04.780 --> 33:05.940]  Is this me doing this one?
[33:06.160 --> 33:08.160]  It is Nick and Gavin.
[33:08.740 --> 33:09.460]  Oh, dear.
[33:10.080 --> 33:10.940]  I already put mine.
[33:11.400 --> 33:12.940]  Nick has already submitted his.
[33:13.440 --> 33:14.020]  Locked in.
[33:14.700 --> 33:20.500]  I am so glad that Gavin submitted what he did.
[33:21.020 --> 33:21.660]  Damn.
[33:22.420 --> 33:27.400]  Because I have no other deciders lined up and Nick wins it with five.
[33:27.840 --> 33:29.200]  Gavin guessed eight.
[33:29.780 --> 33:31.240]  The correct answer is four.
[33:31.240 --> 33:35.260]  Oh, four separate attempts to figure it out.
[33:35.360 --> 33:36.880]  So, Nick, you won that one.
[33:36.880 --> 33:37.200]  Hell yeah.
[33:37.420 --> 33:38.040]  Final round.
[33:38.180 --> 33:38.780]  Final question.
[33:39.620 --> 33:40.540]  What's the best cereal?
[33:40.900 --> 33:41.920]  Oh, we have to pass.
[33:42.000 --> 33:42.580]  We have to pass.
[33:43.780 --> 33:44.840]  Go ahead, guys.
[33:45.420 --> 33:45.940]  Run the board.
[33:46.220 --> 33:46.860]  We'll just pass.
[33:47.000 --> 33:47.780]  We'll just pass back.
[33:48.040 --> 33:49.200]  No, there's no pass backs.
[33:49.520 --> 33:52.580]  Yeah, you see, we couldn't possibly accept.
[33:52.800 --> 33:55.400]  Chef and Gavin taking on cereal.
[33:55.820 --> 33:56.720]  Oh, Christ.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.480]  You're going to be no help here.
[33:59.060 --> 34:01.060]  I've never bought cereal in this country.
[34:01.240 --> 34:01.560]  No?
[34:01.840 --> 34:02.860]  You never bought Squeezles?
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.280]  Uh, I'm going to guess Lucky Charms is up there.
[34:07.860 --> 34:11.860]  Lucky Charms is a guess by Geoff and it is on the board.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.900]  It is the third answer.
[34:14.340 --> 34:15.820]  Was this an international poll?
[34:16.300 --> 34:20.860]  Anyone who, uh, I tweeted it out, I believe, and I think I posted it on the Patreon.
[34:21.400 --> 34:21.660]  Oh.
[34:21.940 --> 34:23.500]  So anyone could have answered.
[34:23.900 --> 34:25.560]  Cheerios are big in your country, right, Gav?
[34:25.900 --> 34:26.700]  Oh, yeah.
[34:27.020 --> 34:27.980]  They're big in America, too.
[34:28.040 --> 34:29.000]  They're boring, but they're big.
[34:29.100 --> 34:30.360]  Maybe you should do Cheerios.
[34:30.360 --> 34:31.400]  Which kind?
[34:31.780 --> 34:32.700]  Just fucking Cheerios.
[34:33.480 --> 34:35.920]  Base Cheerios is their guess.
[34:36.560 --> 34:37.380]  It is not on the list.
[34:37.500 --> 34:38.380]  That's your first X.
[34:39.160 --> 34:40.560]  Probably Honey Nut Cheerios.
[34:41.540 --> 34:43.240]  Yeah, we didn't have Base Cheerios.
[34:43.640 --> 34:46.000]  That probably would have been helpful for Geoff to know.
[34:46.480 --> 34:48.160]  We had a whole conversation about it on the podcast.
[34:48.900 --> 34:50.860]  We got, like, multigrain, but not the...
[34:50.860 --> 34:52.400]  Listen, I didn't remember that conversation.
[34:52.920 --> 34:53.100]  Oh.
[34:53.460 --> 34:54.920]  I remembered that we had a conversation.
[34:55.080 --> 34:56.500]  I didn't remember the guts of it.
[34:57.040 --> 34:58.420]  You want to go Honey Nut Cheerios?
[34:59.120 --> 34:59.940]  Fuck it, why not?
[35:00.400 --> 35:00.800]  Yeah.
[35:01.580 --> 35:03.520]  Honey Nut Cheerios is their second guess.
[35:03.600 --> 35:04.900]  Continuing on the Cheerio train.
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.000]  Cheerio train, so far, has no coal.
[35:08.140 --> 35:09.540]  That is your second X.
[35:09.820 --> 35:10.700]  How can we know that?
[35:11.820 --> 35:12.600]  They know it.
[35:12.940 --> 35:13.180]  It's in there.
[35:13.460 --> 35:14.540]  No, I want to see it visually.
[35:14.540 --> 35:15.340]  Actually, wait, wait.
[35:15.460 --> 35:17.340]  Yeah, I do know how I can represent this.
[35:17.500 --> 35:17.620]  Okay.
[35:18.080 --> 35:19.740]  How do people feel about Frosties?
[35:20.600 --> 35:21.340]  Frosted Flakes?
[35:21.820 --> 35:21.980]  Yeah.
[35:21.980 --> 35:22.800]  I'm fine with it.
[35:22.820 --> 35:23.300]  Let's do that.
[35:23.420 --> 35:24.140]  They're great.
[35:24.520 --> 35:24.700]  Frosty.
[35:24.900 --> 35:26.820]  Gavin has never bought cereal in this country,
[35:26.860 --> 35:28.540]  but he knows what the people likes.
[35:28.760 --> 35:29.480]  Frosted Flakes.
[35:29.480 --> 35:32.340]  The fourth correct answer.
[35:33.060 --> 35:34.280]  Frosties is a way better name.
[35:34.760 --> 35:35.120]  It is.
[35:35.480 --> 35:36.920]  Is that what it's called?
[35:37.580 --> 35:37.760]  Yeah.
[35:38.500 --> 35:42.340]  Just going off, like, popularity on shelves,
[35:42.340 --> 35:44.940]  I feel like Froot Loops has got to be way up there,
[35:45.400 --> 35:47.360]  even though I'm not a huge fan myself.
[35:48.080 --> 35:52.680]  Captain Crunch, he's pretty high up on the list, I would think.
[35:54.800 --> 35:57.240]  Those are the cereals I've heard about on television.
[35:57.740 --> 35:58.140]  Okay.
[35:58.140 --> 36:01.040]  How about Froot Loops?
[36:01.760 --> 36:03.740]  Geoff's guess is Froot Loops.
[36:04.220 --> 36:05.460]  Froot Loops not on the board.
[36:05.580 --> 36:07.700]  Nick, do you have a chance to steal?
[36:08.260 --> 36:10.180]  Are we going with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Nick?
[36:10.760 --> 36:11.400]  I think so.
[36:11.500 --> 36:11.600]  Okay.
[36:11.680 --> 36:12.260]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[36:12.700 --> 36:14.560]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is their guess,
[36:14.680 --> 36:16.520]  and they get the number one answer,
[36:18.160 --> 36:20.360]  stealing those points.
[36:21.060 --> 36:21.320]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:21.640 --> 36:21.980]  Yeah, whatever.
[36:22.220 --> 36:22.860]  Yeah, 100%, dude.
[36:23.100 --> 36:24.240]  I don't like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[36:25.000 --> 36:25.440]  Winners!
[36:25.700 --> 36:26.660]  Cinnamon Toast, hold on.
[36:26.760 --> 36:27.260]  It's too much.
[36:27.260 --> 36:28.380]  It's trying too hard.
[36:29.440 --> 36:30.640]  French Toast Crunch is better.
[36:30.880 --> 36:32.800]  Team Nick and Eric, losers Team Gigi.
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.980]  That puts the series at 1-1.
[36:35.120 --> 36:36.500]  Makes it 0-0, but it's fine.
[36:36.900 --> 36:38.940]  We will be back next time.
[36:39.320 --> 36:39.660]  We won't.
[36:39.660 --> 36:40.420]  Well, that's not the end.
[36:40.520 --> 36:41.480]  I mean, you gotta listen.
[36:41.580 --> 36:43.800]  Check out our Patreon Regulation Pod.
[36:44.340 --> 36:45.640]  We got game plays.
[36:46.260 --> 36:47.500]  Check out Regulatrion.com.
[36:47.560 --> 36:47.760]  It's good.
[36:48.260 --> 36:48.760]  It's great.
[36:48.920 --> 36:50.080]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is delicious.
[36:50.360 --> 36:51.620]  Thank you so much for listening.
[36:52.080 --> 36:56.220]  We will be back with the final game between these head-to-head matchups.
[36:56.220 --> 36:57.380]  Join us then.
[36:57.720 --> 36:58.240]  Goodbye.
[36:58.820 --> 36:59.620]  Bowl of sugar.
[37:00.140 --> 37:00.540]  Protest.
[37:01.540 --> 37:02.960]  Welcome to the protest series.
[37:03.660 --> 37:04.140]  Tail Sync!
[37:04.360 --> 37:05.480]  Was Captain Crunch on?
[37:06.400 --> 37:06.980]  Oh, shit.
[37:06.980 --> 37:07.600]  Yeah, you're right.
[37:08.360 --> 37:09.260]  I didn't even fill out the board.
[37:09.740 --> 37:12.160]  The least popular, Captain Crunch.
[37:13.560 --> 37:15.880]  Second least popular, Fruity Pebbles.
[37:19.200 --> 37:20.260]  I had that.
[37:20.260 --> 37:21.320]  Good for Fruity Pebbles.
[37:21.880 --> 37:23.860]  Good for Fruity Pebbles.
[37:23.880 --> 37:25.060]  The chocolate ones are better, but yeah.
[37:25.120 --> 37:25.420]  I agree.
[37:25.420 --> 37:28.840]  The inconsistent capitalization is doing my nut.
[37:31.120 --> 37:32.280]  Geoff, stop that right now.
[37:32.400 --> 37:33.060]  You're going to throw me off.
[37:34.020 --> 37:35.140]  All right, Tail Sync.
[37:35.260 --> 37:35.600]  Bye!
