[00:02.360 --> 00:08.240]  Welcome to Regulation Feud. Very original, very distinct. My own idea.
[00:08.740 --> 00:12.660]  Thank you for joining us. I am your host, Andrew Pantin.
[00:13.200 --> 00:20.160]  As always, joined by Nick Schwartz, Eric Baudour, Geoff Ramsey, Gavin Frey.
[00:20.640 --> 00:24.300]  Hello. You know how I remember the G's in Ant-egg? Because you talked about that before.
[00:24.520 --> 00:26.300]  Eric, you know how I do it? You know what helps me?
[00:26.660 --> 00:31.400]  The anal, the butt waxing video where Geoff had to go first because he was the first G.
[00:31.840 --> 00:35.180]  That's the only way I remember it. I go, God, Geoff had to go first, that's why.
[00:36.840 --> 00:41.960]  But that's irrelevant. We're playing a game. You hear of a thing called Family Feud?
[00:42.500 --> 00:45.920]  Yeah, but only just recently, you know?
[00:45.940 --> 00:46.960]  Just recently? Yeah.
[00:48.240 --> 00:50.140]  Like three seconds ago, you know?
[00:50.200 --> 00:54.120]  I'm pretty sure it's a TikTok series. I've only seen it there. That's, I think, a new thing.
[00:55.780 --> 01:00.380]  This is a game like that, but totally different. This is Regulation Feud.
[01:00.860 --> 01:04.360]  Now, how this is going to work, we're going to break off into teams of two.
[01:05.080 --> 01:06.800]  I'll let you guys make teams right now.
[01:07.020 --> 01:09.240]  Have we ever done teams? I don't think so.
[01:09.640 --> 01:09.880]  Gavin.
[01:11.840 --> 01:12.540]  What's up, buddy?
[01:13.320 --> 01:14.400]  Eric, you ready to win this shit?
[01:14.580 --> 01:18.680]  Eric and Nick, I think it should be up to Andrew what the teams are.
[01:19.200 --> 01:23.260]  I think that sounds like someone who doesn't want to be on a team with Nick.
[01:23.260 --> 01:24.400]  Yeah, what the fuck?
[01:24.540 --> 01:26.800]  You know what? I think we've seen enough G&G.
[01:27.800 --> 01:28.780]  No G&G.
[01:29.800 --> 01:30.240]  Wow!
[01:32.120 --> 01:32.980]  We've seen it.
[01:34.120 --> 01:34.840]  Gavin left.
[01:36.780 --> 01:38.620]  I left for dramatic effect.
[01:39.840 --> 01:40.540]  That's fair.
[01:41.560 --> 01:43.620]  I don't want to be picked last from class.
[01:43.760 --> 01:45.460]  So what teams, what are the teams, Andrew?
[01:45.880 --> 01:49.360]  We're going to go Geoff and Gavin and Eric and Nick as the two teams.
[01:49.360 --> 01:49.840]  Wait.
[01:51.980 --> 01:52.920]  We're just going with it.
[01:53.060 --> 01:55.780]  This is a chaotic game.
[01:56.120 --> 01:57.280]  We're having chaos happen.
[01:57.620 --> 01:58.760]  We're back to G&G.
[01:59.160 --> 01:59.860]  Team one.
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.120]  Speaking of chaos, I have no idea what happened for the last 30 seconds or so.
[02:05.440 --> 02:07.320]  I just cut out. I couldn't hear you guys.
[02:07.480 --> 02:10.480]  You're on a team with Gavin after not being on a team with Gavin.
[02:10.600 --> 02:11.680]  You're on a team with Gavin now.
[02:11.780 --> 02:15.660]  So I was on a team with Gavin and then I couldn't hear you guys.
[02:15.760 --> 02:17.060]  And now I'm on a team with Gavin again.
[02:17.060 --> 02:19.180]  But there was a period when I wasn't.
[02:19.340 --> 02:20.200]  That is correct.
[02:20.400 --> 02:22.040]  When we weren't on the same team, I left.
[02:22.260 --> 02:25.240]  But in doing so, I broke the ability to see Andrew's screen.
[02:25.420 --> 02:27.160]  You did. Because I don't see it either.
[02:27.340 --> 02:28.240]  It's all fucked up.
[02:28.500 --> 02:29.820]  It's just a spinning wheel.
[02:31.400 --> 02:31.980]  Oh boy.
[02:32.080 --> 02:34.120]  Maybe it's because I'm trying to stream it.
[02:34.980 --> 02:36.280]  Gavin eye texture.
[02:36.660 --> 02:38.160]  Maybe it's because you're in the browser.
[02:38.580 --> 02:39.680]  It's working now.
[02:39.960 --> 02:41.300]  I'm using the app.
[02:43.240 --> 02:45.040]  I'm in the browser to update.
[02:45.520 --> 02:47.400]  So when I started typing, it went away.
[02:47.500 --> 02:48.580]  So that is not good.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.980]  Eric, Nick, what is your team called?
[02:51.780 --> 02:52.160]  NE.
[02:52.740 --> 02:55.800]  It's Nick and Eric. So it's like Team GG and then Team NE.
[02:56.400 --> 02:57.400]  Team New England.
[02:58.260 --> 02:59.300]  We got it.
[02:59.740 --> 03:01.060]  So how this game is going to work is
[03:01.060 --> 03:02.380]  I made a survey.
[03:02.780 --> 03:04.320]  And I sent it out on our Patreon.
[03:04.920 --> 03:06.500]  To all of the people there.
[03:07.580 --> 03:09.500]  We asked them a series of questions.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.500]  Some related to the show.
[03:11.060 --> 03:12.700]  Some general type questions.
[03:12.700 --> 03:14.540]  And I pulled them.
[03:14.700 --> 03:17.020]  And your goal is to find
[03:17.020 --> 03:19.040]  the top 5 for what the questions were.
[03:19.300 --> 03:21.040]  The 5 most common responses
[03:21.040 --> 03:22.460]  to the questions.
[03:22.980 --> 03:24.840]  I have to think like the audience?
[03:25.400 --> 03:26.880]  You gotta get into the brain
[03:26.880 --> 03:28.100]  of the audience.
[03:28.320 --> 03:30.260]  And attempt to figure this out.
[03:30.580 --> 03:31.800]  That's miserable.
[03:32.380 --> 03:35.060]  Now, 5 is
[03:35.060 --> 03:36.860]  the most common answer.
[03:36.960 --> 03:38.180]  And that is worth 5 points.
[03:38.760 --> 03:40.000]  4 is worth 4 points.
[03:40.000 --> 03:40.900]  3 is worth 3.
[03:40.980 --> 03:42.760]  1 is 1.
[03:43.100 --> 03:45.620]  So the number 1 answer is the worst answer.
[03:46.100 --> 03:47.840]  Yeah, number 1 is worth 1 point.
[03:47.980 --> 03:48.900]  So it's the worst answer.
[03:49.220 --> 03:52.040]  Number 5 is the most points, so it's the best answer.
[03:52.440 --> 03:53.640]  You get the most points for the most.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.260]  But before
[03:55.740 --> 03:58.120]  we do that, we have to decide
[03:58.120 --> 03:59.620]  who is going to play.
[04:00.280 --> 04:01.000]  Or who is going to pass.
[04:01.640 --> 04:03.660]  So Team GG and Team NE
[04:03.660 --> 04:06.060]  pick one of you each.
[04:06.300 --> 04:06.820]  You're up, Geoff.
[04:07.640 --> 04:08.220]  I'm up.
[04:08.480 --> 04:09.100]  Sure, why not.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.360]  Question 1.
[04:12.420 --> 04:14.040]  I'm going to ask this question.
[04:14.360 --> 04:14.980]  And it's a number.
[04:16.420 --> 04:17.860]  And then you guys are going to say...
[04:17.860 --> 04:19.040]  I'm going to do a countdown.
[04:19.480 --> 04:21.280]  And when I say go, you'll both say your number.
[04:21.640 --> 04:24.880]  And whoever is closest to the answer
[04:24.880 --> 04:26.300]  will get to decide
[04:26.300 --> 04:28.400]  if they want to try to answer the question first.
[04:28.520 --> 04:29.360]  The first game.
[04:29.740 --> 04:31.720]  Or if they want the other side to pass it.
[04:32.260 --> 04:34.660]  Or play. And then give them the opportunity to steal.
[04:34.660 --> 04:36.840]  So Nick and I are just blurting
[04:36.840 --> 04:38.480]  out the answer as quick as possible.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.260]  I'm going to read
[04:40.260 --> 04:41.780]  out the question.
[04:42.200 --> 04:44.220]  And I'm going to do a countdown. And I'm going to say go.
[04:44.660 --> 04:46.460]  And once I say go, you guys both say a number.
[04:47.180 --> 04:48.660]  And whoever is closest...
[04:48.660 --> 04:50.500]  What if we say the same number?
[04:52.320 --> 04:52.720]  Then...
[04:53.160 --> 04:54.520]  I'll ask a different question.
[04:54.740 --> 04:56.780]  Why not just buzz in with different soundboard
[04:56.780 --> 04:57.320]  sounds?
[04:58.360 --> 05:00.240]  That would require a lot more work from Nick.
[05:00.740 --> 05:02.000]  Unless you want to do that, Gavin.
[05:03.020 --> 05:04.520]  Do you want to do buzz?
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.580]  Do you want to be the buzz board guy?
[05:05.680 --> 05:07.140]  I have a feeling that one won't make it in.
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.020]  Yeah, it's going to be really funny when we're laughing at nothing.
[05:13.520 --> 05:14.240]  Question one.
[05:15.080 --> 05:17.380]  How many pillows form Pillow Mountain?
[05:18.380 --> 05:19.780]  It's a great peak. It's a great mountain.
[05:20.260 --> 05:20.980]  Oh my god.
[05:21.700 --> 05:23.100]  This is a recent count I did.
[05:24.660 --> 05:25.020]  3...
[05:26.020 --> 05:26.380]  2...
[05:26.980 --> 05:27.340]  1...
[05:27.340 --> 05:27.620]  Go.
[05:27.920 --> 05:28.040]  11.
[05:30.860 --> 05:31.500]  Geoff said 8.
[05:32.040 --> 05:33.240]  Nick said 11.
[05:35.220 --> 05:36.260]  The answer...
[05:36.260 --> 05:37.500]  How many pillows form Pillow Mountain?
[05:37.920 --> 05:38.480]  It's going to be 8.
[05:39.220 --> 05:39.740]  17!
[05:41.480 --> 05:43.540]  17 pillows form Pillow Mountain.
[05:43.920 --> 05:45.720]  Nick, I don't know what I'm talking about.
[05:45.860 --> 05:47.700]  Great guess. That's insane.
[05:48.760 --> 05:50.100]  What the fuck?
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.120]  Hold on a second, Andrew.
[05:51.340 --> 05:53.900]  Are you implying that you have a bed
[05:53.900 --> 05:57.000]  that holds 17 pillows?
[05:57.260 --> 05:58.140]  Barely, yes.
[05:58.240 --> 05:59.440]  They fall off the side.
[05:59.620 --> 06:00.260]  They slide.
[06:00.720 --> 06:03.120]  The mountain crashes all the time.
[06:03.920 --> 06:05.860]  But there are 17 pillows.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.580]  They form Pillow Mountain.
[06:07.100 --> 06:08.360]  It used to be 7, didn't it?
[06:08.820 --> 06:12.500]  I bought 5 pillows at Christmas.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.260]  And then I think I've
[06:14.260 --> 06:15.960]  maybe pillaged
[06:15.960 --> 06:17.840]  some pillows from other places in the house.
[06:18.300 --> 06:18.780]  Pillaged.
[06:19.240 --> 06:21.680]  You bought 5 pillows
[06:22.460 --> 06:23.260]  at Christmas?
[06:23.660 --> 06:26.040]  I wanted to upgrade my sleep game, so I bought a bunch of pillows.
[06:26.600 --> 06:28.040]  And I made a right choice.
[06:28.440 --> 06:29.360]  They're king-size pillows.
[06:29.500 --> 06:29.960]  They're massive.
[06:31.240 --> 06:32.700]  It's caused some falling.
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.720]  The bed also slides
[06:35.720 --> 06:37.980]  away from the wall, so the pillows fall down the hole.
[06:38.060 --> 06:39.880]  So I just keep clogging the hole with pillows.
[06:40.080 --> 06:40.720]  It's a whole thing.
[06:40.980 --> 06:43.680]  Anyway, because you won,
[06:44.040 --> 06:45.400]  Nick and Eric, you have to decide
[06:45.400 --> 06:47.340]  do you want to play or do you want to pass?
[06:47.420 --> 06:49.720]  Now, if you play, you have 3
[06:49.720 --> 06:51.020]  strikes to fill the board.
[06:51.420 --> 06:53.660]  If you don't fill the board within 3
[06:53.660 --> 06:55.200]  strikes, then
[06:55.860 --> 06:57.720]  team GG will get
[06:57.720 --> 06:59.200]  to try to steal it.
[06:59.660 --> 07:01.500]  Meaning they will have one chance
[07:01.500 --> 07:03.380]  to say one of the answers you missed.
[07:03.980 --> 07:05.340]  But if they miss that,
[07:05.660 --> 07:06.760]  then you still get the points.
[07:07.580 --> 07:09.540]  So would you like to play or pass?
[07:09.860 --> 07:11.400]  What is the best Jackie Chan movie?
[07:11.740 --> 07:13.160]  Nick, I think we should play, right?
[07:13.180 --> 07:15.940]  I think we play. Let's take this. Let's strike while the striking's good.
[07:16.580 --> 07:17.040]  Damn it.
[07:17.680 --> 07:18.700]  They're playing.
[07:19.060 --> 07:20.400]  Now remember, Nick,
[07:20.640 --> 07:23.100]  it's crucial. This isn't
[07:23.100 --> 07:25.080]  what we... this is not what
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.640]  we think is the best Jackie Chan movie.
[07:27.280 --> 07:29.060]  Like, I don't think
[07:29.060 --> 07:31.100]  that something like Supercop is going to make
[07:31.100 --> 07:31.600]  the list.
[07:32.540 --> 07:34.460]  We have to get in the mind of
[07:35.460 --> 07:37.260]  the listeners of this podcast.
[07:37.580 --> 07:39.160]  The comment leavers, the regulation,
[07:39.340 --> 07:40.340]  you gotta get in there.
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.640]  The tuxedos on this list.
[07:42.440 --> 07:42.780]  Absolutely.
[07:42.780 --> 07:44.800]  Okay, so
[07:44.800 --> 07:46.520]  we're going to go back and forth, or what are we doing?
[07:46.820 --> 07:48.840]  I will start with you, Eric.
[07:49.080 --> 07:51.220]  Eric, what is the best Jackie Chan movie?
[07:51.660 --> 07:52.940]  Okay, I think
[07:52.940 --> 07:54.760]  that what they're going to
[07:54.760 --> 07:57.240]  put as...
[07:57.240 --> 07:57.780]  Boy.
[07:58.780 --> 08:00.320]  The best Jackie Chan movie
[08:00.320 --> 08:02.060]  is going to be Rush Hour.
[08:02.740 --> 08:03.860]  Yeah, Rush Hour.
[08:04.640 --> 08:07.100]  Now to be clear, you mean the first Rush Hour,
[08:07.240 --> 08:08.400]  not two or...
[08:08.400 --> 08:10.480]  Oh, wow. Okay, so the other Rush Hours
[08:10.480 --> 08:11.720]  could potentially be on the list.
[08:11.840 --> 08:14.520]  Anything could be on the list. I'm going to say Rush Hour 1.
[08:14.680 --> 08:16.340]  I'm going to say the first Rush Hour, yes. Rush Hour.
[08:16.460 --> 08:17.160]  First Rush Hour.
[08:18.100 --> 08:20.380]  First Rush Hour is on the list! Yeah!
[08:21.260 --> 08:22.140]  And it's the number one answer.
[08:22.180 --> 08:23.420]  It is our top answer. Wow!
[08:24.720 --> 08:26.620]  Which I personally found surprising.
[08:27.280 --> 08:28.360]  I also find that surprising.
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.580]  That's nuts. As the best Jackie Chan
[08:30.580 --> 08:31.920]  movie, I think that's kind of crazy.
[08:32.240 --> 08:34.000]  Again, Gavin, you have to consider,
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.560]  this isn't actually the best Jackie Chan movie,
[08:36.700 --> 08:38.040]  it's the Jackie Chan movies
[08:38.040 --> 08:39.980]  that the people who listen to this podcast
[08:39.980 --> 08:41.920]  have seen. Yeah, which is
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.140]  still nuts. Yeah.
[08:43.420 --> 08:45.880]  I still think that's high,
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.240]  personally, but... Some of the older stuff
[08:48.240 --> 08:49.940]  that's, you know, foreign language
[08:49.940 --> 08:51.360]  isn't difficult to find.
[08:51.800 --> 08:54.340]  No, I absolutely agree with you.
[08:54.400 --> 08:55.880]  Not for you. Free story, not hard, but
[08:55.880 --> 08:58.200]  here we are. And maybe this, after this category,
[08:58.320 --> 08:59.880]  you'll have a better barometer of what
[08:59.880 --> 09:01.680]  the audience is thinking. Oh!
[09:02.420 --> 09:03.520]  Okay. Nick,
[09:03.860 --> 09:05.960]  what do you think... I'm going to stick
[09:05.960 --> 09:08.000]  to the Jackie Chan movie. On the same chain
[09:08.000 --> 09:09.020]  here, we're going Rush Hour 2.
[09:09.560 --> 09:11.840]  Rush Hour 2? Rush Hour 2
[09:11.840 --> 09:13.180]  is on the list!
[09:14.040 --> 09:16.040]  The second most popular answer.
[09:16.360 --> 09:17.280]  Oh, Jesus.
[09:19.560 --> 09:19.880]  I,
[09:20.500 --> 09:20.980]  personally,
[09:21.900 --> 09:24.200]  I think Rush Hour 2 is better than Rush Hour 1.
[09:24.380 --> 09:25.660]  That's what I thought at the time.
[09:26.500 --> 09:28.160]  So I'm surprised that so many people
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.320]  preferred the original.
[09:30.020 --> 09:31.940]  Now, this could be a factor you need
[09:31.940 --> 09:34.080]  to figure, is that these are manually
[09:34.080 --> 09:36.080]  inserted, so there's probably a
[09:36.080 --> 09:38.160]  percentage of people that put Rush Hour
[09:38.160 --> 09:40.200]  in, thinking they were saying
[09:40.200 --> 09:41.620]  Rush Hour 2. I agree.
[09:42.700 --> 09:43.960]  Now, Nick, do we try to go
[09:43.960 --> 09:46.100]  for Rush Hour 3 and do the clean sweep, or
[09:46.100 --> 09:47.740]  do we change it up? I think we change it up.
[09:48.120 --> 09:50.200]  You think so? Okay. I think one of the
[09:50.200 --> 09:50.820]  Shanghai's.
[09:51.820 --> 09:54.020]  Yeah, but here's the thing, it's the listeners of this podcast,
[09:54.400 --> 09:56.300]  so I gotta put...
[09:56.300 --> 09:58.120]  I gotta say the tuxedo.
[09:58.160 --> 09:59.960]  Yeah, absolutely. Eric's going with the
[09:59.960 --> 10:02.020]  tuxedo as one of the best Jackie Chan
[10:02.020 --> 10:04.040]  movies of all time. It has to be the lowest one.
[10:04.240 --> 10:06.000]  A film that Gavin described as
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.800]  his biggest disappointment of his
[10:07.800 --> 10:09.880]  childhood. Yep. Stand by.
[10:10.000 --> 10:12.240]  Is the third best Jackie Chan
[10:12.240 --> 10:13.240]  movie. Holy shit.
[10:14.680 --> 10:15.840]  We're crushing it.
[10:16.060 --> 10:17.820]  Holy shit. In his top three.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  Guys are killing it, going in order.
[10:20.820 --> 10:21.740]  Currently have
[10:21.740 --> 10:23.700]  11 points on the board.
[10:24.360 --> 10:25.220]  12 points.
[10:26.000 --> 10:26.560]  Nick,
[10:27.440 --> 10:29.900]  back at you. You don't think that they would
[10:29.900 --> 10:31.760]  have done the new Karate Kid, do you?
[10:32.380 --> 10:33.940]  I don't think so. I don't
[10:33.940 --> 10:35.860]  think because that's not... I don't think that's
[10:35.860 --> 10:37.840]  a thing you think of when you think of Jackie
[10:37.840 --> 10:39.900]  Chan off the rip. So which of
[10:39.900 --> 10:41.140]  the Shanghai's are we doing then?
[10:42.680 --> 10:43.220]  Noon or Nights?
[10:44.240 --> 10:46.160]  Noon is more memorable
[10:46.160 --> 10:47.620]  because I forgot that
[10:47.620 --> 10:49.520]  Shanghai Nights was a movie. Okay, perfect.
[10:50.480 --> 10:51.440]  Shanghai Noon.
[10:52.340 --> 10:54.000]  Shanghai Noon is the official
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.220]  guess. Yes.
[10:55.780 --> 10:57.900]  They keep their streak going. Shanghai Noon
[10:59.260 --> 10:59.820]  is...
[11:00.580 --> 11:01.800]  Gavin, the fourth
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.720]  most responded answer.
[11:03.960 --> 11:05.920]  Gavin, we might be in trouble.
[11:06.440 --> 11:07.860]  Gavin, is
[11:07.860 --> 11:10.120]  there a world right now where you think
[11:10.120 --> 11:11.880]  that this hasn't happened and
[11:11.880 --> 11:13.940]  he's just listing the things that we're saying
[11:13.940 --> 11:15.880]  in order? That would be so
[11:15.880 --> 11:16.380]  funny.
[11:20.880 --> 11:23.740]  I think what he's actually doing is gathering data
[11:23.740 --> 11:25.880]  so the community can play Family Feud.
[11:25.880 --> 11:27.780]  I agree.
[11:28.040 --> 11:28.960]  Now, Nick,
[11:29.620 --> 11:31.920]  we have to think, is Shanghai Nights one that
[11:31.920 --> 11:33.920]  people remember or do we go Kung Fu
[11:33.920 --> 11:34.280]  Panda?
[11:36.900 --> 11:37.620]  Or, boy,
[11:37.880 --> 11:38.920]  do we do Rush Hour 3?
[11:39.800 --> 11:41.540]  Because it feels like it might be on there.
[11:41.660 --> 11:43.700]  Do you consider Kung Fu Panda
[11:43.700 --> 11:45.340]  to be a Jackie Chan movie? I don't.
[11:45.400 --> 11:47.460]  I would consider it to be a Jack Black movie.
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.880]  You know what? But he's in it. Hey, of course he's in it
[11:49.880 --> 11:51.860]  but I just don't know that people would...
[11:51.860 --> 11:53.320]  I don't know that it's synonymous with him.
[11:53.320 --> 11:55.360]  Like, I also don't consider it to be an Angelina Jolie
[11:55.360 --> 11:57.020]  movie. No, that's fair.
[11:57.200 --> 11:58.800]  I understand what you're saying. I'd say
[11:59.320 --> 12:01.320]  roll Rush Hour 3. Okay, let's do it.
[12:01.340 --> 12:02.500]  Let's try Rush Hour 3, Andrew.
[12:03.180 --> 12:05.440]  Rush Hour 3 is their guess.
[12:06.240 --> 12:07.400]  Rush Hour 3 is wrong.
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.140]  Your first strike.
[12:09.660 --> 12:11.220]  Swing and a miss. People had
[12:11.220 --> 12:13.000]  enough Rush Hour after Rush Hour 2.
[12:13.520 --> 12:15.300]  Yeah, I agree with that so they're
[12:15.300 --> 12:17.240]  going to make a fourth one. We all laughed at
[12:17.240 --> 12:19.240]  the guy who would not be in Rush Hour 3. Turns out
[12:19.240 --> 12:21.340]  he's the one laughing. Didn't want to
[12:21.340 --> 12:23.340]  be. Didn't need to be. First strike.
[12:23.400 --> 12:25.520]  Two more strikes. What is your next guess?
[12:26.300 --> 12:27.040]  What do you think, Nick?
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.400]  Maybe we do swing with the Kung Fu
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.280]  Panda then. Do you want to try? You want to try
[12:31.280 --> 12:33.420]  Kung Fu Panda? Yeah, let's do it. Kung Fu
[12:33.420 --> 12:35.380]  Panda. Going with a younger
[12:35.380 --> 12:37.260]  audience vote. Recently, there was the
[12:37.260 --> 12:39.120]  fourth film in the franchise
[12:39.120 --> 12:41.360]  making it very relevant but not to
[12:41.360 --> 12:43.480]  our audience. Kung Fu Panda
[12:44.440 --> 12:45.300]  is a miss.
[12:45.420 --> 12:47.200]  Your two strikes. You got one left to
[12:47.200 --> 12:48.840]  lock in this category.
[12:48.840 --> 12:50.620]  What is the
[12:50.620 --> 12:52.820]  best Jackie Chan movie? This is
[12:52.820 --> 12:55.340]  a tough one. What's another...
[12:55.340 --> 12:56.720]  You don't think they're thinking Operation
[12:56.720 --> 12:58.980]  Condor, do you? You're going to blow it.
[12:59.940 --> 13:00.540]  Do you
[13:00.540 --> 13:02.480]  think we go with Shanghai Knights?
[13:03.060 --> 13:03.680]  You think Shanghai...
[13:04.640 --> 13:06.240]  Let's do it? Let's do it. Alright.
[13:07.200 --> 13:08.380]  Shanghai Knights. Let's give it a try.
[13:08.800 --> 13:10.560]  I think that's crazy. I think Shanghai Yoon
[13:10.560 --> 13:12.440]  being on this list is nuts.
[13:12.800 --> 13:14.500]  So let's try Shanghai Knights. I like
[13:14.500 --> 13:15.920]  Shanghai Dude but just
[13:15.920 --> 13:17.880]  throwing out just the absurdity
[13:17.880 --> 13:19.960]  of declaring that Shanghai Knights is one
[13:19.960 --> 13:21.220]  of Jackie Chan's top five films.
[13:22.040 --> 13:23.920]  You're out with three strikes. It is
[13:23.920 --> 13:25.920]  not there. Okay. Geoff
[13:25.920 --> 13:27.520]  and Gavin, Team GG
[13:27.520 --> 13:29.940]  have a chance to steal
[13:29.940 --> 13:31.940]  the category. Geoff and Gavin, what are
[13:31.940 --> 13:33.780]  you thinking? So Geoff, do you think we should go
[13:33.780 --> 13:36.220]  foreign or do you think we should...
[13:36.220 --> 13:37.800]  I think you need to get into the
[13:37.800 --> 13:39.200]  mind of our audience.
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.700]  I'm immediately thinking it's going to be like Police
[13:41.700 --> 13:43.220]  Story or Who Am I because
[13:43.220 --> 13:45.080]  Who Am I has been on the...
[13:45.080 --> 13:46.400]  Who Am I is a big one or I
[13:46.980 --> 13:49.300]  immediately go to Rumble in the Bronx but that might be
[13:49.300 --> 13:51.360]  my bias because it's the first one
[13:51.360 --> 13:51.940]  I saw.
[13:53.380 --> 13:53.400]  Ugh.
[13:54.820 --> 13:56.600]  I also don't think Karate Kid is a bad choice.
[14:00.570 --> 14:01.010]  Um...
[14:01.010 --> 14:03.150]  Just like three Police Stories I think.
[14:03.190 --> 14:04.990]  You're the Jackie Chan guy
[14:04.990 --> 14:07.310]  so I'm going to let you make the
[14:07.310 --> 14:09.310]  choice. I'll support whatever you think but
[14:09.310 --> 14:11.350]  I don't think it's going to be one of his foreign
[14:11.350 --> 14:13.050]  films like Drunken Master or
[14:13.050 --> 14:13.930]  any of those.
[14:14.570 --> 14:16.370]  Personally, but I trust you.
[14:17.350 --> 14:18.590]  I mean, I would go...
[14:18.590 --> 14:20.750]  I'm drawn to Who Am I because it was
[14:21.670 --> 14:22.970]  often quoted on
[14:23.570 --> 14:25.010]  Achievement Hunter videos but I don't know
[14:25.010 --> 14:26.790]  if necessarily people remember that.
[14:27.270 --> 14:28.830]  Well, it's only for one point, you know?
[14:29.310 --> 14:29.630]  Yeah.
[14:31.030 --> 14:31.690]  Go with your gut.
[14:32.530 --> 14:35.090]  It is the least responded of the top five.
[14:35.590 --> 14:37.230]  So it is the least popular
[14:37.230 --> 14:37.950]  of the top five.
[14:39.670 --> 14:40.930]  The least popular...
[14:40.930 --> 14:42.610]  What other American shite was he in?
[14:43.190 --> 14:44.950]  He was in Shanghai Noon. He was in
[14:44.950 --> 14:45.670]  Shanghai Nights.
[14:46.050 --> 14:48.750]  He was in Rush Hour 1. He was in Rush Hour 2.
[14:48.770 --> 14:50.410]  He was in Rush Hour 1. He was in Rush Hour 2.
[14:52.430 --> 14:53.390]  I like your
[14:53.390 --> 14:54.590]  Who Am I question.
[14:54.670 --> 14:55.610]  Should we go with it?
[14:55.790 --> 14:57.990]  It's probably a Police Story.
[14:58.710 --> 15:00.010]  Your answer is Who Am I?
[15:01.590 --> 15:02.470]  The answer
[15:02.470 --> 15:03.850]  was said.
[15:04.690 --> 15:06.350]  It came out of somebody's mouth.
[15:06.950 --> 15:08.530]  But it wasn't Who Am I.
[15:09.310 --> 15:10.510]  Team NE
[15:10.510 --> 15:11.530]  win the category.
[15:12.770 --> 15:13.970]  14 points.
[15:14.390 --> 15:16.730]  The least answered top five.
[15:17.010 --> 15:17.850]  Geoff, you said it.
[15:18.250 --> 15:19.170]  Drunken Master.
[15:21.650 --> 15:21.790]  Damn.
[15:22.330 --> 15:23.030]  At the very bottom.
[15:24.030 --> 15:25.410]  Kudos to the audience.
[15:25.750 --> 15:28.410]  Yeah, really. I would not have
[15:28.410 --> 15:29.310]  put that on them.
[15:30.510 --> 15:31.870]  Wow. Okay.
[15:32.270 --> 15:34.170]  Cool. Newfound respect gained.
[15:34.810 --> 15:35.550]  Yeah, there you go.
[15:35.550 --> 15:37.490]  Also, definitely
[15:37.490 --> 15:39.510]  not one of his five best
[15:39.510 --> 15:39.970]  movies.
[15:41.150 --> 15:41.630]  Like,
[15:43.990 --> 15:45.590]  fun, not one of his
[15:45.590 --> 15:46.450]  five best movies.
[15:47.110 --> 15:49.110]  Let's move on to
[15:49.110 --> 15:50.530]  the next decider.
[15:50.930 --> 15:51.470]  Oh boy.
[15:53.130 --> 15:55.210]  What is Condor Man's Rotten Tomatoes score?
[15:55.830 --> 15:57.690]  Once again, if both teams want to pick a representative
[15:57.690 --> 15:58.670]  to guess this one.
[15:58.830 --> 15:59.970]  I'll do it this time, Nick.
[16:01.270 --> 16:02.550]  Your turn, Geoff.
[16:02.550 --> 16:02.870]  Okay.
[16:04.230 --> 16:05.910]  Well, the question is,
[16:06.190 --> 16:08.370]  what is Condor Man's Rotten Tomatoes score?
[16:08.630 --> 16:09.690]  I'm going to count down.
[16:10.110 --> 16:12.350]  3, 2, 1,
[16:12.610 --> 16:13.010]  go.
[16:13.190 --> 16:13.610]  14.
[16:16.430 --> 16:17.070]  1344.
[16:20.090 --> 16:21.190]  It's close.
[16:21.750 --> 16:24.410]  I think there's a lot of nostalgia.
[16:26.170 --> 16:26.350]  However,
[16:26.650 --> 16:28.650]  this is going
[16:28.650 --> 16:30.370]  to G&G.
[16:30.370 --> 16:31.810]  It is 27.
[16:32.150 --> 16:34.570]  Wow, that is so much lower
[16:34.570 --> 16:35.170]  than I thought.
[16:36.410 --> 16:38.410]  The question in the next game is,
[16:38.670 --> 16:39.690]  what is the best apple?
[16:40.030 --> 16:42.250]  Team G&G, do you
[16:42.250 --> 16:44.490]  want to play or pass?
[16:45.090 --> 16:46.590]  I mean, I think we want to
[16:46.590 --> 16:47.430]  play, right?
[16:47.890 --> 16:50.170]  You guys can pass, though, if you want to.
[16:50.890 --> 16:52.350]  Like, don't think too hard
[16:52.350 --> 16:54.410]  about it. Yeah, you guys can hand it off. It's okay.
[16:55.510 --> 16:55.970]  Totally fine.
[16:56.750 --> 16:57.930]  Sounds like they want to play.
[16:58.530 --> 17:00.050]  I'll just go first
[17:00.050 --> 17:01.590]  if you want. Who goes first, Andrew?
[17:02.110 --> 17:03.730]  What is the best apple? Go ahead, Geoff.
[17:03.950 --> 17:05.110]  I'm going to pick Cosmic Crisp.
[17:06.070 --> 17:07.650]  Cosmic Crisp is your guess.
[17:07.830 --> 17:09.770]  Bad answer. It's a great
[17:09.770 --> 17:11.450]  apple, great people,
[17:11.950 --> 17:13.630]  fans of the show, supporters
[17:13.630 --> 17:15.730]  of us. So it should come to a little
[17:15.730 --> 17:17.870]  surprise. Cosmic Crisp is the number
[17:17.870 --> 17:19.190]  one apple. Hell yeah.
[17:19.870 --> 17:21.570]  One polled by
[17:21.570 --> 17:22.430]  the audience.
[17:23.450 --> 17:25.830]  Gavin, you're a big apple lover. What is
[17:25.830 --> 17:26.610]  the second
[17:27.390 --> 17:29.370]  best apple, according to our audience?
[17:29.430 --> 17:30.930]  Or just the second opinion?
[17:31.850 --> 17:33.550]  I think it's probably going to be
[17:33.550 --> 17:35.030]  Cosmic Adjacent, surely.
[17:35.810 --> 17:37.230]  What do you reckon? Like a Pink Lady, Geoff?
[17:37.650 --> 17:39.750]  I think a Pink Lady is a great choice.
[17:40.190 --> 17:41.470]  I think a Honey Crisp,
[17:42.910 --> 17:43.350]  um...
[17:43.350 --> 17:45.510]  Red Delicious is a popular one.
[17:45.510 --> 17:47.350]  Should we go with Honey Crisp? Let's go with Honey Crisp.
[17:47.710 --> 17:49.230]  Okay. Honey Crisp
[17:49.690 --> 17:50.910]  is their official guest.
[17:51.930 --> 17:53.730]  Not guest. I know I say guest.
[17:53.730 --> 17:55.470]  Don't make fun of the host.
[17:55.970 --> 17:57.770]  I think they should lose points for making fun of the host.
[17:58.310 --> 17:59.730]  No, that was a fair mistake.
[18:00.350 --> 18:01.750]  Yeah, they should be down in the negative.
[18:01.750 --> 18:04.210]  You have five hypothetical points, but now
[18:04.770 --> 18:05.930]  you've got seven
[18:05.930 --> 18:07.050]  hypothetical points.
[18:07.490 --> 18:09.610]  Wow, that's so low.
[18:10.430 --> 18:11.990]  It's way lower than I thought.
[18:12.150 --> 18:14.010]  Me too. That's like my number two apple.
[18:14.350 --> 18:15.750]  Leaving you with the one,
[18:15.870 --> 18:17.070]  three, and four point left.
[18:17.730 --> 18:18.970]  Geoff, what is the best apple?
[18:19.550 --> 18:21.510]  Oh, Gav, what do you think? Do you think
[18:21.870 --> 18:23.030]  Macintosh is going to get picked?
[18:23.570 --> 18:25.270]  Oh, shit. I mean, do you think
[18:25.270 --> 18:27.270]  that would be picked before Pink Ladies
[18:27.270 --> 18:29.390]  and Granny Smiths? Maybe Granny Smith
[18:29.390 --> 18:30.530]  would be low because it's green.
[18:31.250 --> 18:33.470]  How about Red Delicious? People eat that a lot, right?
[18:33.610 --> 18:33.870]  Or Gala?
[18:35.850 --> 18:36.570]  Red Delish.
[18:39.630 --> 18:40.570]  Take your hand off the piece.
[18:40.690 --> 18:41.330]  Take your hand off the piece.
[18:41.470 --> 18:44.530]  Take it off Pink Lady.
[18:45.350 --> 18:45.710]  Oh!
[18:48.390 --> 18:49.750]  He took his hand.
[18:49.750 --> 18:51.930]  He had the Red Delicious piece
[18:51.930 --> 18:53.510]  in his fingers. I couldn't do it.
[18:53.590 --> 18:55.510]  He was about to play it. He swapped it out
[18:55.510 --> 18:56.610]  for Pink Lady.
[18:57.290 --> 18:58.350]  Is Pink Lady on the board?
[18:59.250 --> 19:01.350]  She sure is! With the three
[19:01.350 --> 19:02.890]  point answer.
[19:03.230 --> 19:05.570]  So what's number four? Pink Lady.
[19:05.590 --> 19:07.470]  I know what it is. Coming in.
[19:08.450 --> 19:09.150]  You guys currently have
[19:09.650 --> 19:11.750]  ten points. When it comes to us, we got it.
[19:11.830 --> 19:13.750]  With two left to find. The fourth and the one
[19:13.750 --> 19:15.750]  point. Watch him swing and a miss.
[19:15.770 --> 19:16.510]  Gavin, what's the best apple?
[19:16.510 --> 19:18.050]  Here we go.
[19:18.730 --> 19:20.610]  You reckon we should go Red Delish next?
[19:21.650 --> 19:21.990]  Yeah.
[19:23.110 --> 19:23.710]  Yeah.
[19:25.170 --> 19:26.250]  Red Delicious!
[19:27.310 --> 19:28.510]  Red Delicious
[19:28.510 --> 19:30.650]  after being nearly played last
[19:30.650 --> 19:32.770]  time is being played this time.
[19:33.110 --> 19:34.750]  Which is a foolish move
[19:34.750 --> 19:36.310]  because Red Delicious is not on the board!
[19:36.610 --> 19:38.670]  Not on the list! You fool!
[19:38.850 --> 19:40.430]  Strike one. Strike one.
[19:40.650 --> 19:41.770]  Strike one.
[19:42.310 --> 19:44.010]  That's right. That'll be our only strike.
[19:44.010 --> 19:46.050]  Gavin claiming
[19:46.050 --> 19:47.290]  only strike. Back to Geoff.
[19:47.890 --> 19:48.610]  I'm gonna go with Fuji.
[19:49.750 --> 19:50.530]  Fuji?
[19:51.870 --> 19:53.370]  Interesting pick.
[19:54.950 --> 19:55.730]  Fuji
[19:55.730 --> 19:58.110]  is on the
[19:58.110 --> 19:59.510]  board as
[19:59.510 --> 20:01.950]  the least popular.
[20:02.130 --> 20:02.830]  It's the one point.
[20:03.550 --> 20:05.690]  Leaving you with
[20:05.690 --> 20:07.750]  one left.
[20:07.990 --> 20:09.110]  The four point answer.
[20:10.190 --> 20:11.630]  You have two strikes remaining.
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.430]  I would've gone Granny Smith
[20:13.430 --> 20:15.590]  if the number one was left, but I don't think
[20:15.590 --> 20:16.910]  Granny Smith will be number four.
[20:18.270 --> 20:18.750]  Surely.
[20:19.750 --> 20:21.690]  It's name recognition though, you know?
[20:21.870 --> 20:22.970]  It's a famous apple.
[20:23.510 --> 20:25.690]  And for a lot of people, their favorite apple.
[20:27.210 --> 20:27.670]  What are you
[20:27.670 --> 20:29.390]  guessing? What is the best apple?
[20:32.110 --> 20:33.550]  I've gone Apple Blank.
[20:34.330 --> 20:35.690]  You can talk about it with Geoff!
[20:35.930 --> 20:37.090]  Yeah, think on it. Collaborate.
[20:37.350 --> 20:38.290]  They're lost.
[20:39.030 --> 20:40.590]  So we had Gala, we had
[20:40.590 --> 20:42.070]  Granny Smith. What else did we have, Geoff?
[20:42.810 --> 20:44.490]  Uh, Granny Smith, Gala,
[20:44.850 --> 20:45.670]  we also had
[20:46.610 --> 20:47.690]  Macintosh, we said.
[20:49.150 --> 20:49.710]  And...
[20:49.710 --> 20:52.370]  I think that's it. I think that's all
[20:52.370 --> 20:52.950]  that we've said.
[20:53.870 --> 20:56.470]  Alright, should we just do Gala and Granny Smith?
[20:56.870 --> 20:57.130]  Yeah.
[20:58.510 --> 20:59.210]  Granny Smith!
[21:01.070 --> 21:02.590]  Gavin guesses Granny Smith.
[21:03.850 --> 21:04.490]  Granny Smith
[21:04.490 --> 21:06.130]  is the number four answer!
[21:06.130 --> 21:07.290]  You guys cleared
[21:07.290 --> 21:08.590]  the category!
[21:09.410 --> 21:10.010]  Way to go!
[21:12.730 --> 21:14.050]  GG, taking
[21:14.050 --> 21:15.990]  the lead 15 points to 14.
[21:16.830 --> 21:18.070]  Nick, you have to think of the audience,
[21:18.210 --> 21:19.250]  man. You can't think about what
[21:19.250 --> 21:20.870]  apples are actually good.
[21:20.990 --> 21:23.490]  You can't let it get to you, dude.
[21:23.670 --> 21:25.730]  Not compared to a pink lady or a honeydew crisp.
[21:25.990 --> 21:26.750]  Yep, absolutely.
[21:27.330 --> 21:28.410]  Gold is delicious.
[21:29.670 --> 21:31.730]  Nick, you can't think of it factually.
[21:31.830 --> 21:33.850]  You have to think of it like a zany
[21:33.850 --> 21:35.930]  audience member. You just have to
[21:35.930 --> 21:37.810]  say the first thing that comes to your
[21:37.810 --> 21:39.030]  fucking little brain.
[21:39.670 --> 21:41.310]  It's named after an old lady.
[21:41.630 --> 21:42.550]  It's gonna taste ancient.
[21:42.910 --> 21:45.790]  Nothing zany about a Granny Smith. Solid choice.
[21:46.090 --> 21:46.930]  Solid apple.
[21:47.310 --> 21:50.090]  Premium placement in the grocery store for a reason.
[21:50.430 --> 21:52.230]  Excellent sheen as well.
[21:52.490 --> 21:54.110]  Yeah, when you got caramel on it,
[21:54.150 --> 21:54.390]  sure.
[21:55.370 --> 21:56.890]  That's a good point. It's great with caramel.
[21:57.250 --> 21:58.130]  Tell him, Nick.
[21:58.570 --> 22:00.930]  To the next decider.
[22:01.350 --> 22:02.330]  Nick, this could be you.
[22:02.350 --> 22:04.390]  What percentage are my ankles today?
[22:04.870 --> 22:05.630]  Alright, Nick, lock it in.
[22:06.610 --> 22:08.810]  Think about the numbers. Think about what he's been up to.
[22:10.550 --> 22:11.270]  Think about
[22:11.270 --> 22:13.590]  why we were late to this recording.
[22:14.210 --> 22:14.890]  Geoff, you gonna do it?
[22:15.270 --> 22:15.910]  Yeah, I got it.
[22:16.490 --> 22:19.010]  Geoff's gonna do it. Nick versus Geoff.
[22:19.210 --> 22:19.510]  Here we go.
[22:19.630 --> 22:23.050]  3, 2, 1, go.
[22:23.150 --> 22:23.910]  45. 86.
[22:26.310 --> 22:27.310]  That's insanely high.
[22:27.350 --> 22:27.910]  Nick said 45.
[22:27.910 --> 22:30.310]  Geoff said 86.
[22:32.870 --> 22:33.990]  The answer...
[22:33.990 --> 22:34.730]  99%!
[22:34.950 --> 22:35.370]  They're great!
[22:35.590 --> 22:38.050]  I knew it!
[22:38.630 --> 22:40.990]  He hasn't complained about his ankles in forever!
[22:41.310 --> 22:42.390]  That's such a good point.
[22:42.910 --> 22:45.650]  Gotta leave room for them to be somehow better,
[22:45.790 --> 22:46.610]  but no issues.
[22:46.970 --> 22:47.810]  Zero complaints.
[22:48.130 --> 22:49.570]  Which leads us to the next category.
[22:50.030 --> 22:51.430]  What's the best flavor of ice cream?
[22:51.690 --> 22:52.630]  Oh, shit.
[22:53.230 --> 22:54.730]  Flavors can get ridiculous.
[22:54.730 --> 22:55.410]  Fuck.
[22:56.690 --> 22:57.610]  They get complicated.
[22:59.290 --> 23:01.210]  I know what the top one is.
[23:01.890 --> 23:02.190]  Okay.
[23:03.210 --> 23:04.970]  But it doesn't help us right here.
[23:05.550 --> 23:06.990]  No, but that's why we wait on it.
[23:07.050 --> 23:08.610]  They're gonna blow it and we'll take it.
[23:08.790 --> 23:11.270]  I feel like people who pass are such idiots.
[23:11.530 --> 23:13.550]  They're just removing their own screen time.
[23:13.890 --> 23:15.450]  I don't know if we could get all five.
[23:15.970 --> 23:16.370]  I agree.
[23:16.610 --> 23:17.590]  I think we should pass.
[23:18.710 --> 23:19.150]  Wow!
[23:21.370 --> 23:22.730]  I just think it's...
[23:23.150 --> 23:24.510]  Yeah, I would rather pass.
[23:24.770 --> 23:25.910]  Let's sweep it with a steal.
[23:26.250 --> 23:27.050]  Yeah, we'll steal.
[23:27.610 --> 23:27.870]  Okay.
[23:30.890 --> 23:32.550]  I love that you said that, Gavin.
[23:32.650 --> 23:33.330]  I'm right there with you.
[23:34.650 --> 23:35.610]  Absolutely, I do.
[23:35.930 --> 23:37.930]  And that is gonna be cookie dough.
[23:38.790 --> 23:39.590]  Yeah, absolutely.
[23:40.710 --> 23:42.630]  You said that with a lot of confidence.
[23:43.230 --> 23:44.470]  Where do you think it ranks,
[23:44.550 --> 23:46.310]  if you were gonna guess on this board,
[23:46.350 --> 23:46.910]  if it were there?
[23:47.330 --> 23:48.250]  Four or five.
[23:48.250 --> 23:50.010]  Oh, really? I think it's top three.
[23:50.810 --> 23:52.750]  Top three? You guys both think it's top three?
[23:53.210 --> 23:54.690]  Cookie dough is on the board!
[23:55.210 --> 23:56.490]  It's the two-point answer.
[23:56.770 --> 23:57.550]  There you go.
[23:58.970 --> 24:00.190]  Barely squeaking in.
[24:03.030 --> 24:04.730]  What is your next guest?
[24:05.950 --> 24:07.050]  I keep saying guest.
[24:07.190 --> 24:09.110]  Why am I fucking throwing a T on that?
[24:09.550 --> 24:10.330]  Best guess.
[24:10.910 --> 24:11.190]  Jesus.
[24:12.230 --> 24:15.070]  You gotta get in the mind of the audience.
[24:15.410 --> 24:18.170]  And I think what they're going for
[24:19.350 --> 24:20.070]  is vanilla.
[24:20.670 --> 24:21.390]  Oh, interesting.
[24:21.570 --> 24:21.890]  Yeah.
[24:22.970 --> 24:25.710]  How do you feel about the vanilla pick, Gavin and Geoff?
[24:26.330 --> 24:27.630]  I would have picked it, but it's
[24:28.090 --> 24:28.950]  not something I would eat.
[24:31.230 --> 24:33.350]  I think you're gonna be surprised.
[24:34.570 --> 24:35.530]  I don't know that it's on there.
[24:35.610 --> 24:36.670]  Okay, so what does that mean?
[24:36.910 --> 24:39.530]  I don't know that it's on there. I don't know that vanilla's gonna show up.
[24:39.850 --> 24:41.750]  I think it'll be either the number five
[24:41.750 --> 24:43.790]  point, or it'll be not on there at all.
[24:44.710 --> 24:46.170]  Gavin has great ice cream senses
[24:46.170 --> 24:48.110]  because it is the number five answer.
[24:48.430 --> 24:49.010]  Yeah, absolutely.
[24:49.290 --> 24:52.490]  It's number five, which means it's the number one answer.
[24:52.690 --> 24:53.810]  I don't understand.
[24:54.750 --> 24:55.490]  Okay, sure.
[24:56.550 --> 24:56.690]  Okay.
[24:57.890 --> 24:58.850]  It's plain.
[24:59.570 --> 25:00.830]  You have to think of the audience.
[25:01.030 --> 25:03.050]  You can't consider your own tastes.
[25:03.390 --> 25:05.370]  I feel like I am thinking of the audience
[25:05.370 --> 25:07.170]  because most of them are Gen Z
[25:07.170 --> 25:10.570]  and they're growing up in a land of plentiful ice cream flavors,
[25:10.570 --> 25:12.570]  whereas a Gen X guy,
[25:12.670 --> 25:13.910]  I grew up with three flavors.
[25:13.910 --> 25:14.850]  No, they're not.
[25:15.230 --> 25:17.350]  You're wrong. They're not Gen Z.
[25:18.110 --> 25:18.670]  Are they?
[25:18.850 --> 25:20.130]  You're absolutely wrong.
[25:20.310 --> 25:22.430]  They're older than Gen Z.
[25:22.630 --> 25:23.670]  You're so...
[25:23.670 --> 25:26.850]  You got the wrong demographic brain going
[25:26.850 --> 25:28.210]  for what the picks are.
[25:28.990 --> 25:32.030]  These are people like my age, Nick's age.
[25:32.730 --> 25:33.830]  Those are the people
[25:33.830 --> 25:35.330]  that picked those Jackie Chan movies?
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.150]  Are you fucking serious?
[25:37.430 --> 25:39.530]  Older millennials picked those Jackie Chan movies?
[25:39.530 --> 25:39.930]  Yes!
[25:39.930 --> 25:41.050]  Look at them.
[25:41.130 --> 25:41.970]  It's Rush Hour.
[25:44.270 --> 25:45.130]  So did you guys.
[25:45.170 --> 25:47.550]  You guys are sitting on the picks and saying they're horrible.
[25:47.970 --> 25:50.410]  I went younger and you blew it.
[25:50.430 --> 25:50.630]  No, no, no.
[25:51.170 --> 25:52.330]  You guys spent the whole time going,
[25:52.390 --> 25:53.450]  you gotta consider the age of the audience.
[25:53.650 --> 25:57.610]  All I'm saying is I think that vanilla
[25:57.610 --> 25:58.870]  is a boring pick.
[25:58.990 --> 26:00.870]  I don't think anybody eats vanilla ice cream
[26:00.870 --> 26:02.890]  unless it's the only thing available.
[26:03.230 --> 26:05.390]  You only eat vanilla ice cream if you go to a store
[26:05.390 --> 26:07.090]  and they have a chocolate and vanilla and that's it
[26:07.090 --> 26:08.370]  and the chocolate's out of order.
[26:08.530 --> 26:10.390]  Only if it's inside a lolly.
[26:11.050 --> 26:12.730]  This is what I want you guys to know.
[26:12.870 --> 26:14.010]  I know you so well.
[26:14.310 --> 26:16.510]  Geoff, Gavin, they wish they knew.
[26:16.670 --> 26:18.370]  I know you inside and out.
[26:19.270 --> 26:20.490]  That's gotta hurt you so bad.
[26:20.510 --> 26:22.490]  The thing about it, you don't want Eric to know you
[26:22.490 --> 26:24.730]  because for Eric to know you means
[26:24.730 --> 26:25.590]  he doesn't like you.
[26:25.750 --> 26:27.410]  Eric says, I don't like you audience.
[26:28.190 --> 26:30.210]  It's not a compliment what he's saying.
[26:30.330 --> 26:31.970]  Geoff, you and I finally agree.
[26:33.870 --> 26:34.790]  That's the sad thing.
[26:34.790 --> 26:36.310]  The difference is I like the audience.
[26:37.250 --> 26:39.150]  Eric, so going off that logic,
[26:40.090 --> 26:42.030]  something so simple and easy
[26:42.030 --> 26:43.150]  tells me chocolate has to be
[26:43.150 --> 26:43.890]  three or four, right?
[26:44.630 --> 26:46.410]  Here's the thing about chocolate.
[26:46.530 --> 26:47.490]  I want to say yes.
[26:47.790 --> 26:50.770]  If it's near the bottom of the list,
[26:51.050 --> 26:53.390]  yeah, let's, hey, do it, Nick.
[26:53.670 --> 26:54.050]  Chocolate!
[26:54.750 --> 26:55.990]  That's definitely number four.
[26:56.690 --> 26:57.890]  I think it is three.
[26:57.970 --> 27:00.710]  Gavin says it's definitely number four.
[27:01.690 --> 27:03.610]  It is the three point answer.
[27:03.610 --> 27:05.130]  Chocolate is on the board.
[27:05.970 --> 27:07.650]  Eric, I'm telling you
[27:07.650 --> 27:09.250]  mint chocolate chip is on this list.
[27:09.850 --> 27:11.670]  I think it is. I'm going to save that one
[27:11.670 --> 27:12.750]  for you because I think I know what I want.
[27:13.010 --> 27:16.510]  I think cookies and cream
[27:16.510 --> 27:18.070]  is on this list.
[27:18.870 --> 27:19.870]  Cookies and cream?
[27:20.210 --> 27:21.750]  Nick got excited about that.
[27:22.250 --> 27:23.810]  That's an advanced flavor, I think.
[27:24.490 --> 27:25.670]  Yeah, do you think cookies
[27:25.670 --> 27:27.270]  and cream would be on your radar, team GG?
[27:27.710 --> 27:28.970]  No, I don't think so.
[27:29.370 --> 27:29.950]  Not at all?
[27:29.950 --> 27:30.650]  Well,
[27:31.550 --> 27:33.590]  it barely is on the board.
[27:33.710 --> 27:35.390]  It is the one point answer.
[27:36.010 --> 27:37.930]  I'm so glad
[27:37.930 --> 27:38.750]  we didn't do this.
[27:39.150 --> 27:40.750]  Do you want to do it, Nick?
[27:41.590 --> 27:42.750]  Yeah, you know what?
[27:42.850 --> 27:45.510]  If I'm wrong, it's going to be something like strawberry.
[27:45.830 --> 27:45.990]  Okay.
[27:48.210 --> 27:49.230]  Mint chocolate chip.
[27:50.130 --> 27:51.290]  Nick says mint chocolate chip
[27:51.290 --> 27:53.570]  as the second most popular answer
[27:53.570 --> 27:54.390]  for four points.
[27:54.750 --> 27:56.070]  This would lock up the category.
[27:57.210 --> 27:58.410]  They have locked it up.
[27:58.470 --> 27:59.750]  It is mint chocolate chip.
[28:00.170 --> 28:02.370]  The second most popular.
[28:02.790 --> 28:03.770]  Audience, audience,
[28:04.110 --> 28:05.390]  I know you so fucking well.
[28:05.390 --> 28:06.850]  I fucking know you.
[28:07.350 --> 28:10.090]  They handed us the category, Nick.
[28:10.190 --> 28:11.510]  They said here, here,
[28:11.710 --> 28:13.410]  fucking slam dunk us.
[28:13.410 --> 28:15.390]  I'm fucking glad we gave it to you guys.
[28:15.530 --> 28:17.190]  There's no way we would have got that.
[28:17.190 --> 28:18.750]  It should be 29, shouldn't it, bud?
[28:20.990 --> 28:22.030]  Uh, yes.
[28:22.350 --> 28:24.090]  Thank you very much.
[28:24.630 --> 28:26.410]  I feel like we should get an extra point for that.
[28:26.550 --> 28:27.990]  I wouldn't have guessed cookies and cream
[28:27.990 --> 28:28.890]  in a million years.
[28:29.630 --> 28:30.370]  Hey, great job, Eric.
[28:31.090 --> 28:33.530]  Cookies and cream, here's my thing.
[28:33.550 --> 28:36.390]  I'll tell you what, cookies and cream is not a Gen X or a Millennial pick.
[28:36.730 --> 28:37.570]  It was.
[28:37.930 --> 28:39.070]  It absolutely is.
[28:39.410 --> 28:41.310]  Because when you go Baskin Robbins,
[28:41.510 --> 28:43.130]  that's the first time you're getting it.
[28:44.330 --> 28:45.290]  There's the first time,
[28:45.530 --> 28:47.110]  the first time you're going to,
[28:47.290 --> 28:49.310]  oh man, what's cookies and cream?
[28:49.430 --> 28:51.350]  I'm six and I'm going to Baskin Robbins.
[28:51.350 --> 28:53.790]  I'm going to try this thing that's close to what I know,
[28:54.310 --> 28:55.970]  but it's not quite that different.
[28:56.370 --> 28:57.470]  That's why cookies and cream made that list.
[28:57.570 --> 29:00.050]  Easy, easy, easiest pick of the whole thing.
[29:00.170 --> 29:00.430]  Damn.
[29:01.170 --> 29:02.090]  Hey, great job.
[29:02.630 --> 29:04.490]  You got it right, so there you go.
[29:04.930 --> 29:06.670]  You did. Moving on.
[29:06.750 --> 29:08.550]  And I think it's important for you guys to know,
[29:09.130 --> 29:10.570]  that is the halfway point of the game.
[29:10.670 --> 29:13.430]  We are halfway through. There are six rounds
[29:13.430 --> 29:15.870]  and then the winning team will move on to a seventh
[29:15.870 --> 29:17.390]  to see if they can claim
[29:17.390 --> 29:19.610]  their regulation championship.
[29:19.610 --> 29:21.730]  But moving on to
[29:21.730 --> 29:24.070]  decider for the round four.
[29:24.510 --> 29:25.030]  This is all you, Eric.
[29:25.850 --> 29:27.830]  According to Heinz.com,
[29:28.030 --> 29:29.830]  how many products, including
[29:29.830 --> 29:31.850]  variations, do they currently have
[29:31.850 --> 29:32.430]  in the U.S. market?
[29:32.910 --> 29:33.990]  Holy shit.
[29:34.730 --> 29:36.330]  Oh my god.
[29:38.110 --> 29:39.790]  It was very funny for
[29:39.790 --> 29:41.730]  Nick to immediately declare, this is all you,
[29:41.810 --> 29:41.990]  Eric.
[29:42.930 --> 29:44.650]  I said it before I read it.
[29:45.330 --> 29:47.870]  We're putting the sauce guy on the bench
[29:47.870 --> 29:48.370]  for this one.
[29:49.330 --> 29:50.890]  It's because I believe in Eric, man.
[29:51.170 --> 29:53.930]  So it is Nick versus
[29:53.930 --> 29:55.550]  Gavin, or Eric versus Gavin.
[29:55.670 --> 29:58.170]  Including variations.
[29:58.650 --> 29:59.990]  Yeah, that's the one that really gets me
[29:59.990 --> 30:02.030]  too. So I will clarify that.
[30:02.550 --> 30:03.930]  It's the same sauce, but they're
[30:03.930 --> 30:05.750]  saying it's in like three different bottle sizes.
[30:06.450 --> 30:07.230]  Oh, that's some bullshit.
[30:07.790 --> 30:07.970]  What?
[30:09.470 --> 30:11.030]  Oh my god.
[30:11.230 --> 30:12.050]  From all I could tell.
[30:13.470 --> 30:15.630]  I went on their website and I clicked
[30:15.630 --> 30:17.530]  all products and this is the
[30:17.530 --> 30:19.350]  number that they displayed.
[30:19.930 --> 30:22.450]  I'm Professor X-ing this to you.
[30:22.550 --> 30:22.810]  Okay.
[30:24.630 --> 30:25.270]  3
[30:26.150 --> 30:26.790]  2
[30:27.590 --> 30:28.730]  1. Go.
[30:30.050 --> 30:30.690]  457?
[30:31.150 --> 30:31.790]  Okay.
[30:32.670 --> 30:34.310]  We have quite a range.
[30:36.130 --> 30:37.730]  Gavin guessing 400.
[30:38.510 --> 30:39.370]  We had Eric
[30:39.370 --> 30:40.830]  guessing 57.
[30:41.050 --> 30:43.470]  Nick, what was the number you were trying to send
[30:43.470 --> 30:44.690]  to Eric's brain?
[30:44.970 --> 30:46.690]  I was sending him 75.
[30:47.490 --> 30:49.750]  Wow! So what happened
[30:49.750 --> 30:51.390]  is because I'm looking
[30:51.390 --> 30:53.490]  at the screen so it mirrored and it went backwards.
[30:53.510 --> 30:54.130]  Oh wow.
[30:54.810 --> 30:56.930]  Oh shit, I didn't even realize. Nice.
[30:57.810 --> 30:58.570]  That's tough.
[30:58.810 --> 31:01.630]  Unfortunately, it didn't really matter because the answer
[31:01.630 --> 31:02.650]  is 62.
[31:03.450 --> 31:03.970]  400.
[31:04.730 --> 31:07.430]  Way over the guess.
[31:07.610 --> 31:09.250]  The only thing that I thought was
[31:09.250 --> 31:11.370]  Heinz 57 and I just went, I guess that's
[31:11.370 --> 31:12.930]  gotta be something. It's close, right?
[31:13.050 --> 31:15.430]  I was thinking 57 but then he said different bottle sizes
[31:15.430 --> 31:17.530]  and stuff and I was like, well that could be 5 of the same
[31:17.530 --> 31:18.210]  thing. Yeah.
[31:19.090 --> 31:21.330]  There's like 1 or 2 sauces that they listed
[31:21.330 --> 31:23.510]  as different sized bottles for some
[31:23.510 --> 31:23.770]  reason.
[31:25.310 --> 31:27.370]  But that moves on to question 4.
[31:28.190 --> 31:29.350]  What is your favorite merch
[31:29.350 --> 31:29.810]  we have sold?
[31:30.750 --> 31:32.610]  Do you want to play or pass?
[31:33.770 --> 31:35.690]  Let's think it through. Do we want to play or pass?
[31:36.410 --> 31:37.390]  Man, I don't want to hand
[31:37.390 --> 31:39.390]  it over to them to see what they can do, but
[31:39.390 --> 31:41.470]  I think there's going to be one on there
[31:41.470 --> 31:43.310]  that they're not going to remember shit about and go
[31:43.310 --> 31:45.010]  that fucking thing? And I think
[31:45.010 --> 31:47.330]  it's going to fuck them up. You're right. Let's do it.
[31:47.430 --> 31:49.150]  Hand it off. Okay. Alright, we're going to pass.
[31:49.310 --> 31:50.550]  Team GG, you go for it.
[31:51.070 --> 31:52.590]  Team GG is taking it.
[31:53.570 --> 31:53.670]  Yeah.
[31:55.430 --> 31:57.270]  We clearly got in their heads
[31:57.270 --> 31:59.270]  so let's go ahead and own this.
[31:59.430 --> 32:00.510]  What are you thinking?
[32:01.670 --> 32:02.030]  Ooh.
[32:02.910 --> 32:04.630]  Do you reckon the scrumping sign will be up there?
[32:04.850 --> 32:07.090]  I think the scrumping sign is a great one. I would definitely
[32:07.090 --> 32:08.290]  go with that. Okay.
[32:09.470 --> 32:10.690]  Gavin says scrumping sign.
[32:11.230 --> 32:13.250]  Gavin is going with scrumping sign?
[32:14.410 --> 32:15.230]  Scrumping sign
[32:15.230 --> 32:17.070]  is on the list. It is the
[32:17.070 --> 32:19.150]  two point answer. Nice.
[32:19.470 --> 32:19.950]  Scrumping sign.
[32:21.270 --> 32:22.890]  The falcon stuff is too
[32:22.890 --> 32:24.930]  recent to be on the list. No, I think that
[32:24.930 --> 32:27.050]  because it's so recent, it might be
[32:27.050 --> 32:28.990]  weighted toward it because it's
[32:28.990 --> 32:31.030]  fresh in people's heads. So are we thinking
[32:31.030 --> 32:33.030]  the falcon sign or the shirt or
[32:33.030 --> 32:34.970]  the shoulder falcon? I wouldn't
[32:34.970 --> 32:36.990]  say the shirt at all.
[32:37.230 --> 32:38.650]  Probably not the sign.
[32:38.930 --> 32:40.710]  I would think the shoulder falcon
[32:41.410 --> 32:42.990]  is interesting. I wouldn't be
[32:42.990 --> 32:45.010]  surprised if it's not on there, but I'm worth taking a chance on it.
[32:45.070 --> 32:46.370]  I'm going to say shoulder falcon.
[32:46.730 --> 32:48.390]  Geoff is saying shoulder falcon.
[32:48.810 --> 32:51.190]  Will his dream of winning this round
[32:51.190 --> 32:52.990]  fly much like the majestic
[32:52.990 --> 32:55.050]  falcon does? We'll have to find
[32:55.050 --> 32:56.510]  out, but he's at least getting a point
[32:56.510 --> 32:59.010]  for shoulder falcon being the
[32:59.010 --> 33:01.150]  one point answer on
[33:01.150 --> 33:02.950]  the list. You guys have
[33:02.950 --> 33:04.430]  cleared out the bottom of the board,
[33:05.230 --> 33:06.970]  leaving you with the top three
[33:06.970 --> 33:08.970]  answers. The five, the four,
[33:09.030 --> 33:10.850]  and the three point. Gavin,
[33:10.950 --> 33:12.990]  what is the best merch we
[33:12.990 --> 33:14.730]  sold? The Gerpler is an obvious choice.
[33:15.090 --> 33:16.950]  Yeah, I think that's number five, probably.
[33:17.070 --> 33:18.790]  Let's go ahead and go with Gerpler. Going
[33:18.790 --> 33:20.350]  Gerpler by a
[33:21.210 --> 33:22.630]  large majority, I would say.
[33:22.950 --> 33:24.930]  Although, when we finish the category, I'll get
[33:24.930 --> 33:26.830]  into how some of the data is a little bit wonky
[33:26.830 --> 33:28.710]  on this. Gerpler, five points.
[33:28.730 --> 33:30.890]  Not even going to do a thing for it. It's obvious. It's
[33:30.890 --> 33:33.030]  there. The five point
[33:33.030 --> 33:34.950]  answer. Leaving the four point and the
[33:34.950 --> 33:36.710]  three point. Geoff,
[33:37.170 --> 33:38.790]  what is your favorite merch we have sold?
[33:39.330 --> 33:40.750]  Gavin, I'm thinking for the
[33:40.750 --> 33:42.770]  four or the three point, one of them is
[33:42.770 --> 33:44.790]  probably going to be the
[33:44.790 --> 33:46.850]  episode 16 LP. How do you
[33:46.850 --> 33:48.930]  feel about that choice? Ooh, great one.
[33:49.010 --> 33:50.910]  I forgot about that. It was very
[33:50.910 --> 33:52.810]  highly sought after. Sold out
[33:52.810 --> 33:54.730]  immediately. We had to do a rare
[33:54.730 --> 33:56.950]  second printing, so I feel safe
[33:56.950 --> 33:58.870]  about it. Are you okay with me picking that?
[33:58.870 --> 34:01.110]  Yep. I'm going to pick that.
[34:01.570 --> 34:02.970]  Episode 16 LP is
[34:02.970 --> 34:04.790]  the official guess. Gavin
[34:04.790 --> 34:06.990]  forgot about it, and so
[34:06.990 --> 34:08.990]  did the audience apparently. Unfortunately, it is
[34:08.990 --> 34:10.890]  not there. First
[34:10.890 --> 34:13.010]  strike against Team GG.
[34:15.170 --> 34:16.450]  Early strike, too.
[34:17.210 --> 34:18.370]  What are you thinking, Gav?
[34:25.380 --> 34:26.400]  So we had the
[34:27.140 --> 34:28.780]  NASA stuff we had.
[34:30.340 --> 34:30.660]  Let me know
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.560]  if you need any help. I know what I'm going with, Eric.
[34:33.040 --> 34:34.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:34.520 --> 34:36.520]  This is good. The Straw, I don't think people
[34:36.520 --> 34:38.140]  liked. What are you talking about?
[34:38.460 --> 34:40.760]  I certainly didn't. What a monster
[34:40.760 --> 34:41.800]  that was to try to use.
[34:42.320 --> 34:44.380]  Don't forget about, we have Port-a-Potty,
[34:44.940 --> 34:46.300]  Tiki Mugs, we
[34:46.860 --> 34:47.260]  have
[34:48.360 --> 34:50.380]  Pre-Hit Baseballs, we have
[34:50.380 --> 34:52.480]  Bat Nobs. Yeah, oh,
[34:52.540 --> 34:54.640]  we got Bat Nobs. A lot of popular stuff out there.
[34:54.640 --> 34:56.480]  We also got the old, uh, the misprint hat.
[34:57.160 --> 34:58.400]  Yeah, the fuck, the fuck hat.
[34:58.500 --> 34:59.760]  Russian fuck hat. Russian fuck hat.
[34:59.760 --> 35:01.440]  Oh, Bat Nobs are interesting.
[35:01.880 --> 35:03.800]  What do you think? I think you gotta
[35:03.800 --> 35:05.760]  make sure that whichever one you pick is
[35:05.760 --> 35:06.280]  on the board.
[35:08.340 --> 35:10.100]  Dude, that's some good team advice right there.
[35:10.100 --> 35:11.920]  That's a player coach. As the host
[35:11.920 --> 35:13.780]  of this game. I wouldn't take
[35:13.780 --> 35:15.240]  a flyer. I'd go with something,
[35:15.700 --> 35:17.600]  I'd go with something you're pretty goddamn certain about.
[35:17.740 --> 35:19.460]  That wasn't limited, was it, the Bat Nob?
[35:19.780 --> 35:21.600]  What was it? Uh, we sold
[35:21.600 --> 35:23.620]  a thousand of them. Yes.
[35:25.160 --> 35:25.700]  So yeah,
[35:25.720 --> 35:27.620]  I think they were pretty limited. Yeah, I think
[35:27.620 --> 35:29.280]  maybe limited stuff won't be on here because
[35:29.280 --> 35:31.340]  more people didn't have them.
[35:31.840 --> 35:32.360]  Huh.
[35:33.480 --> 35:34.000]  Interesting.
[35:36.980 --> 35:38.640]  How about the Beanhole Pen?
[35:39.720 --> 35:40.600]  Beanhole Pen.
[35:42.320 --> 35:43.040]  I need
[35:43.040 --> 35:44.860]  an answer. Gavin, what is your favorite
[35:44.860 --> 35:47.200]  merch we have sold? Thank you, host.
[35:48.260 --> 35:49.140]  Uh, the pen.
[35:50.200 --> 35:51.060]  Beanhole Pen is their
[35:51.060 --> 35:53.100]  guess. You can leave the Beanhole
[35:53.100 --> 35:55.060]  Pen in the dirt. It is not on
[35:55.060 --> 35:57.000]  the list. That is strike number
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.260]  two. Alright, Geoff, you got it.
[35:59.260 --> 36:00.280]  One strike left.
[36:00.780 --> 36:01.300]  Geoff,
[36:02.700 --> 36:04.260]  what else did we make?
[36:04.880 --> 36:06.280]  What is your favorite merch we've sold?
[36:06.500 --> 36:09.180]  So much stuff. Remember that picture of all the merch?
[36:09.820 --> 36:10.080]  Yeah.
[36:10.760 --> 36:13.040]  The problem here, and it's
[36:13.040 --> 36:14.980]  a problem I'm happy to have,
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.060]  is that we made so much phenomenal
[36:17.060 --> 36:19.040]  and interesting merch over
[36:19.040 --> 36:21.040]  the course of three years that it's really
[36:21.040 --> 36:22.120]  hard to whittle. It's like
[36:22.800 --> 36:24.940]  trying to pick your favorite A-plus
[36:24.940 --> 36:26.620]  term paper. They're all A-pluses, right?
[36:27.120 --> 36:28.940]  So, uh, I'm
[36:28.940 --> 36:30.940]  gonna go with
[36:30.940 --> 36:32.800]  the Pre-Hit Baseballs.
[36:33.760 --> 36:34.940]  Pre-Hit
[36:34.940 --> 36:35.720]  Baseballs.
[36:36.820 --> 36:38.420]  Geoff's setting up for a home run
[36:38.840 --> 36:40.840]  to get points on the board, because we're
[36:40.840 --> 36:41.560]  near the end of the game.
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.540]  But unfortunately, it's a miss ball.
[36:44.720 --> 36:47.180]  Pre-Hit Baseballs not on the list.
[36:47.440 --> 36:48.420]  Giving team
[36:48.820 --> 36:51.140]  N.E. the opportunity
[36:51.140 --> 36:52.980]  to steal
[36:52.980 --> 36:53.920]  and round the bases.
[36:55.380 --> 36:57.260]  Oh, that's so funny. I just texted you.
[36:57.700 --> 36:58.880]  There's no need
[36:58.880 --> 37:00.360]  for you to
[37:00.800 --> 37:02.920]  slack or text. You can just
[37:02.920 --> 37:05.200]  say what you're thinking. This is your
[37:05.200 --> 37:06.620]  steal opportunity as a team.
[37:06.840 --> 37:08.280]  Wow, Nick, I didn't even think of those.
[37:08.360 --> 37:11.000]  I think we go with the first one I did
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.160]  for sure, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go for it.
[37:13.340 --> 37:14.700]  Alright, the Ratty Boy shirt.
[37:15.860 --> 37:16.220]  Ooh.
[37:17.440 --> 37:19.080]  Nick suggests the Ratty
[37:19.080 --> 37:20.880]  Boy shirt for the steal.
[37:22.060 --> 37:23.080]  Eric, what were you
[37:23.080 --> 37:25.320]  thinking? Just out of curiosity to build the suspense.
[37:26.060 --> 37:27.080]  Here's what else I was
[37:27.080 --> 37:28.920]  thinking. Because this is our one and only guess
[37:28.920 --> 37:31.000]  on this, right? Well, you've already
[37:31.000 --> 37:32.960]  guessed what Nick has said, but I'm
[37:32.960 --> 37:34.160]  curious what you were thinking.
[37:34.700 --> 37:36.720]  Right. What I'm asking is that
[37:36.720 --> 37:38.820]  if he gets it right, do we keep
[37:38.820 --> 37:40.640]  going or is that the end of it? If he's right, you steal the points. No.
[37:41.000 --> 37:42.860]  If he gets it right, you steal the points. You're all good.
[37:43.140 --> 37:44.840]  If it's wrong, the points
[37:44.840 --> 37:46.520]  go back. I'm just asking. Nick,
[37:46.640 --> 37:48.880]  I still think yours is a great...
[37:48.880 --> 37:50.300]  I think your guess is the right one to go with.
[37:50.460 --> 37:52.700]  I sent to him Andrew
[37:52.700 --> 37:55.040]  Mask and
[37:55.880 --> 37:57.000]  the Protected
[37:57.000 --> 37:58.560]  by Falcons sign.
[37:59.440 --> 38:00.740]  I also slacked
[38:00.740 --> 38:02.780]  Eric the Anal Passage shirt.
[38:03.340 --> 38:04.820]  Yes. Anal Passage shirt
[38:04.820 --> 38:06.800]  was the other guess that we had.
[38:07.140 --> 38:08.840]  I think all four of these
[38:08.840 --> 38:10.960]  are very, very strong.
[38:11.420 --> 38:12.840]  Anal Passage is a great...
[38:12.840 --> 38:14.300]  That is a great one. Great suggestion.
[38:14.320 --> 38:16.960]  All great pieces of merch that were said.
[38:18.440 --> 38:19.160]  None were
[38:19.160 --> 38:20.860]  correct. Team G&G
[38:20.860 --> 38:22.680]  get the points.
[38:23.060 --> 38:24.700]  That brings it 23
[38:24.700 --> 38:26.080]  to 29.
[38:26.520 --> 38:28.400]  What else? Let's start making some guesses.
[38:28.900 --> 38:30.560]  Exactly. I want to get something
[38:30.560 --> 38:32.600]  that's more fresh. I'm going to say the cookbook.
[38:33.460 --> 38:34.660]  Cookbook was there.
[38:34.800 --> 38:36.480]  That was the three-point answer.
[38:36.640 --> 38:37.880]  Not Slop O'Clock, surely.
[38:38.720 --> 38:40.780]  No, Slop O'Clock's not on there. Nobody bought it.
[38:40.780 --> 38:41.140]  Fridge Magnet?
[38:42.100 --> 38:44.880]  Fridge Magnet was not in the top five. Now, I will say
[38:44.880 --> 38:46.720]  something that should have been
[38:46.720 --> 38:48.820]  in the top five, but people spelled
[38:48.820 --> 38:50.740]  it in so many different ways, it was
[38:50.740 --> 38:52.800]  so hard to compile. But if you scroll
[38:52.800 --> 38:54.700]  through, it probably is in the top five. It's the
[38:54.700 --> 38:56.400]  Fuck Hat. The Messed Up Fuck Hat.
[38:56.440 --> 38:59.140]  It's not there. You're missing one.
[38:59.480 --> 38:59.960]  Toaster?
[39:00.680 --> 39:02.300]  No. You're missing a classic.
[39:03.520 --> 39:04.780]  No. It was
[39:04.780 --> 39:05.800]  the Grown Tube.
[39:07.680 --> 39:08.980]  Those didn't fucking
[39:08.980 --> 39:09.880]  move at all!
[39:11.320 --> 39:12.960]  People love the Grown Tubes
[39:12.960 --> 39:14.980]  apparently. They like the idea of it more than
[39:14.980 --> 39:16.660]  buying it. Yeah, no kidding.
[39:17.800 --> 39:18.940]  I forgot about
[39:18.940 --> 39:21.120]  so much of that. We made a lot of shit.
[39:21.300 --> 39:22.560]  That's insane. That's crazy.
[39:22.760 --> 39:24.140]  I love how much we forgot, actually.
[39:24.300 --> 39:26.440]  The stuff that people love. That was awesome.
[39:26.560 --> 39:29.040]  That category was great, because
[39:29.040 --> 39:30.960]  everything that we named was
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.880]  better than the things that ended up
[39:32.880 --> 39:33.460]  on there.
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.880]  Ratty Boy's shirt should
[39:38.880 --> 39:40.940]  be on that list with the amount that I have to
[39:40.940 --> 39:42.080]  fucking see it.
[39:43.980 --> 39:45.220]  Anal Passage
[39:45.220 --> 39:47.160]  shirt was number one with a bullet.
[39:47.340 --> 39:47.880]  It was like our
[39:48.660 --> 39:49.940]  highest selling item.
[39:50.140 --> 39:52.820]  It was the most highest selling item in the company that year.
[39:53.100 --> 39:54.160]  Yes, it was.
[39:54.420 --> 39:56.740]  It destroyed. That's so
[39:56.740 --> 39:58.580]  fucking funny.
[39:59.540 --> 40:00.940]  So it looks like
[40:00.940 --> 40:02.840]  Team GG has got
[40:02.840 --> 40:04.980]  23 points and Team Northeast
[40:04.980 --> 40:06.940]  has 29 points.
[40:07.780 --> 40:08.700]  Let's see
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.340]  which direction
[40:10.340 --> 40:12.640]  success is blowing with this
[40:12.640 --> 40:14.660]  next category. Andrew?
[40:15.120 --> 40:15.640]  We're going
[40:16.480 --> 40:18.700]  to the decider. I didn't expect you to
[40:18.700 --> 40:20.680]  keep going, Geoff. When you said my name, I thought
[40:20.680 --> 40:21.620]  that was a clear throwaway.
[40:23.780 --> 40:24.580]  Geoff, you
[40:24.580 --> 40:25.680]  threw it perfectly.
[40:26.440 --> 40:28.680]  No, I threw it perfectly and I went
[40:28.680 --> 40:30.220]  I was like, that's my little
[40:30.860 --> 40:32.500]  Oh, I see. I didn't see.
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.700]  I thought you like shoulder pumped it. I thought that was a
[40:34.700 --> 40:36.700]  pump fake and I jumped
[40:36.700 --> 40:38.700]  I missed that.
[40:39.340 --> 40:40.700]  As you see, Team GG
[40:40.700 --> 40:42.620]  versus Team New England. Team New England
[40:42.620 --> 40:44.740]  leading by six points.
[40:45.460 --> 40:46.260]  We are
[40:46.260 --> 40:48.280]  going into the decider
[40:48.280 --> 40:50.920]  for game five, or round five, I guess.
[40:51.800 --> 40:52.220]  Decider!
[40:53.100 --> 40:54.720]  Who wants to take
[40:54.720 --> 40:56.680]  this on? I should have asked before I
[40:56.680 --> 40:57.120]  scrolled down.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.300]  We need one person from each team
[41:00.300 --> 41:02.480]  being willing to...
[41:02.480 --> 41:02.860]  Eric?
[41:02.860 --> 41:03.060]  Eric?
[41:04.280 --> 41:06.660]  Wait, Nick, did you just tell me that I'm doing it?
[41:06.880 --> 41:08.100]  Yeah, you sure did.
[41:08.480 --> 41:09.640]  Gavin, you should probably do it too.
[41:10.340 --> 41:11.960]  I feel like you're luckier.
[41:12.500 --> 41:14.060]  Gavin, we got it.
[41:14.200 --> 41:15.040]  Eric versus Gavin.
[41:17.260 --> 41:18.360]  What do you mean?
[41:18.700 --> 41:19.660]  I'm going to need you.
[41:21.540 --> 41:22.900]  I don't know the answer
[41:22.900 --> 41:23.660]  to any of this shit.
[41:24.260 --> 41:25.820]  I don't even know what the question means.
[41:27.140 --> 41:28.660]  That might give you an edge.
[41:28.800 --> 41:30.580]  Who knows? What I'm going to need is
[41:30.580 --> 41:32.280]  for you both to slack me
[41:32.280 --> 41:34.380]  a number in a minute.
[41:34.600 --> 41:35.940]  I'm going to read the question. Decider five.
[41:36.320 --> 41:37.780]  How many players were selected
[41:37.780 --> 41:39.800]  in the first NFL draft?
[41:40.400 --> 41:42.160]  Gavin, you've done a bunch of gaffs.
[41:42.180 --> 41:43.600]  Not gaffs, drafts.
[41:43.900 --> 41:45.120]  Fuck me.
[41:45.740 --> 41:46.260]  What?
[41:47.740 --> 41:48.820]  That did not help.
[41:49.540 --> 41:50.300]  No, no, no.
[41:50.580 --> 41:52.540]  I'm sorry.
[41:52.980 --> 41:54.960]  You're already struggling.
[41:55.880 --> 41:58.020]  The first NFL gaff in history.
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.540]  Yeah, the first NFL gaff in history.
[41:59.680 --> 42:00.520]  How many players were drafted?
[42:01.120 --> 42:02.380]  Let's think about this, Gavin.
[42:02.580 --> 42:05.340]  There were probably a lot less teams in the NFL back then.
[42:05.400 --> 42:07.380]  There were less players to be drafted.
[42:07.960 --> 42:08.540]  You can't help.
[42:09.120 --> 42:11.200]  Wait, hang on.
[42:11.300 --> 42:13.220]  I said I'm going to slack you a number
[42:13.220 --> 42:15.020]  and that was immediately, you can't help.
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.480]  But Geoff went on like...
[42:17.980 --> 42:20.200]  Listen, we're getting the rust off this game.
[42:20.380 --> 42:21.580]  Yeah, we're just knocking the rust off.
[42:21.620 --> 42:22.240]  I didn't hear that part.
[42:22.760 --> 42:23.520]  This is ridiculous.
[42:23.520 --> 42:25.440]  You haven't sent me a number yet.
[42:25.720 --> 42:27.300]  Because I'm going to talk to Nick about it.
[42:27.300 --> 42:28.680]  Alright, I'm just going to go with my gut.
[42:28.980 --> 42:29.160]  Done.
[42:30.980 --> 42:31.860]  Thanks, man.
[42:32.360 --> 42:33.360]  Are you kidding me?
[42:35.380 --> 42:36.780]  Jesus Christ, no.
[42:37.160 --> 42:37.600]  Disqualified.
[42:38.480 --> 42:39.720]  We're not doing this.
[42:41.580 --> 42:42.340]  This is bullshit.
[42:43.460 --> 42:44.080]  This is over.
[42:44.360 --> 42:45.060]  This is done.
[42:46.460 --> 42:47.400]  Throw it out.
[42:48.120 --> 42:51.420]  Guys, thank you so much for watching Regulation Feud.
[42:51.420 --> 42:53.580]  Is this a fucking joke?
[42:53.640 --> 42:54.880]  We waited two months?
[42:55.480 --> 42:57.220]  We waited two months for this.
[42:57.320 --> 42:58.220]  Two months?
[42:58.980 --> 42:59.820]  Is this a joke?
[43:00.560 --> 43:01.940]  Are you kidding me, Andrew?
[43:02.600 --> 43:04.620]  Did you just fuck it up that bad?
[43:04.740 --> 43:06.080]  Gavin, what was your guess?
[43:06.500 --> 43:06.920]  81.
[43:08.040 --> 43:09.640]  No, absolutely not.
[43:09.780 --> 43:10.480]  No, protest.
[43:10.940 --> 43:13.780]  I respect your protest.
[43:13.920 --> 43:14.920]  I'm sorry, that's on me.
[43:15.660 --> 43:16.900]  You're right to be mad.
[43:16.900 --> 43:19.580]  However, Gavin is correct.
[43:19.700 --> 43:21.940]  With the exact right answer.
[43:22.340 --> 43:23.080]  81.
[43:23.420 --> 43:25.180]  Is the correct answer.
[43:25.780 --> 43:28.480]  81 is the exact answer.
[43:28.780 --> 43:28.800]  Protest.
[43:29.280 --> 43:29.580]  No.
[43:30.660 --> 43:31.540]  Technicality.
[43:31.740 --> 43:32.520]  Down.
[43:32.720 --> 43:32.960]  Boo.
[43:33.400 --> 43:35.800]  What a good guess.
[43:36.760 --> 43:38.240]  We're not doing this.
[43:38.680 --> 43:41.680]  You have to decide.
[43:41.780 --> 43:44.320]  Do you want to play or pass?
[43:44.320 --> 43:45.400]  What do you mean?
[43:46.160 --> 43:48.120]  It's family feud.
[43:48.380 --> 43:49.580]  But it's regulation.
[43:49.820 --> 43:52.040]  Because it's surveyed by our community members.
[43:52.440 --> 43:53.420]  This is legitimately
[43:54.290 --> 43:56.080]  in our tenure
[43:56.080 --> 43:57.700]  of being a company.
[43:58.520 --> 44:00.060]  You had no idea what it was.
[44:00.360 --> 44:02.040]  You had no idea what it was.
[44:02.320 --> 44:03.740]  There was no prep.
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.420]  This is the worst thing.
[44:05.700 --> 44:08.840]  Andrew, we waited two months to do this last part.
[44:09.160 --> 44:10.520]  This is the worst thing
[44:10.520 --> 44:11.760]  we've ever recorded.
[44:12.380 --> 44:14.460]  Something about Eric's new mixer.
[44:14.640 --> 44:16.680]  Whenever he gets mad, I can't hear anything he says.
[44:17.520 --> 44:18.060]  I was thinking
[44:18.060 --> 44:19.300]  at the process of my head
[44:19.300 --> 44:20.860]  how this would work in the show.
[44:21.140 --> 44:22.160]  You would get to see the question.
[44:22.480 --> 44:24.380]  It is best Halo game. Do you want to play or pass?
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.180]  Surely in the game, we would be buzzing in on that, wouldn't we?
[44:28.400 --> 44:29.040]  No, you wouldn't.
[44:29.160 --> 44:31.400]  First of all, you don't even fucking know what this game is.
[44:31.580 --> 44:33.660]  You just remembered it 20 seconds ago.
[44:33.820 --> 44:35.480]  Don't tell me how this game works.
[44:35.800 --> 44:37.040]  I think we'll play, Geoff, right?
[44:37.380 --> 44:39.020]  Yeah, sure, man.
[44:41.500 --> 44:41.900]  This...
[44:41.900 --> 44:43.060]  In the real game, it would be that
[44:43.060 --> 44:44.560]  disjointed category. Okay, Geoff,
[44:44.760 --> 44:47.100]  and Gavin, you are playing.
[44:48.080 --> 44:49.220]  Eric, you have the lead.
[44:50.260 --> 44:51.580]  Yeah, but not for long.
[44:51.680 --> 44:52.820]  Yeah, no shit.
[44:53.140 --> 44:54.520]  Because I would have won...
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.460]  There's like six Halo games. How could they fuck this up?
[44:57.560 --> 44:58.880]  There's quite a few Halo games.
[44:59.220 --> 45:00.360]  There's way more than six.
[45:00.420 --> 45:02.380]  The fact that you think there's only six, that's a problem for you.
[45:02.500 --> 45:04.240]  I mean, there's two that are obviously bad.
[45:05.040 --> 45:07.300]  That's not necessarily true.
[45:07.300 --> 45:08.360]  Don't help us.
[45:08.740 --> 45:11.140]  I'm not helping. I'm just saying,
[45:11.720 --> 45:13.980]  Geoff, what is one of the best Halo games?
[45:14.480 --> 45:14.880]  Halo 3.
[45:16.060 --> 45:17.420]  Halo 3
[45:19.600 --> 45:21.260]  is Geoff's guess.
[45:22.720 --> 45:23.400]  Halo 3
[45:24.440 --> 45:25.120]  is
[45:26.240 --> 45:27.580]  the five-point answer.
[45:29.120 --> 45:29.240]  What?
[45:29.800 --> 45:31.780]  I think...
[45:31.780 --> 45:33.220]  No, it's the most popular.
[45:33.340 --> 45:35.020]  It's worth five points.
[45:35.020 --> 45:35.960]  It's the number one.
[45:37.580 --> 45:39.260]  We're all figuring this out.
[45:39.360 --> 45:40.020]  So that was a great guess.
[45:40.160 --> 45:41.740]  I think we got fucked, Eric.
[45:42.060 --> 45:43.020]  Yeah, no shit!
[45:43.400 --> 45:46.900]  It says three, four, three words. That's very Halo, isn't it?
[45:50.820 --> 45:52.380]  It is. Yeah, you're right.
[45:53.380 --> 45:54.120]  It's a whole company.
[45:54.740 --> 45:55.400]  Halo 2.
[45:56.460 --> 45:59.020]  Halo 2 is Gavin's guess.
[46:00.120 --> 46:00.960]  Halo 2 is the
[46:00.960 --> 46:02.060]  second most popular,
[46:02.060 --> 46:03.940]  according to our listeners.
[46:04.740 --> 46:05.780]  Our wonderful
[46:05.780 --> 46:07.520]  community members. Geoff,
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.560]  what's one of the best Halo games?
[46:11.660 --> 46:12.420]  Halo Reach.
[46:13.560 --> 46:14.620]  Halo Reach
[46:14.620 --> 46:16.480]  is the third
[46:16.480 --> 46:17.680]  most popular
[46:17.680 --> 46:18.800]  answer
[46:18.800 --> 46:20.660]  to this question.
[46:28.800 --> 46:29.780]  Gavin,
[46:31.800 --> 46:32.780]  name
[46:32.780 --> 46:34.900]  one of the best Halo games.
[46:36.940 --> 46:37.780]  Geoff, you think
[46:39.200 --> 46:40.720]  Halo... you think ODST would be
[46:40.720 --> 46:41.540]  above 4 and 5?
[46:42.560 --> 46:44.740]  Do you think 4 and 5 would be above 2
[46:44.740 --> 46:45.340]  or 1?
[46:46.340 --> 46:48.040]  Oh, 2 is already in there, sorry.
[46:48.360 --> 46:50.780]  I think ODST...
[46:52.320 --> 46:54.540]  Yeah, I think so.
[46:55.480 --> 46:56.660]  Or we could just throw in Halo 1.
[46:56.920 --> 46:58.100]  I just feel like less people played it.
[46:59.280 --> 47:00.800]  Yeah, well, go with
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.740]  your gut. You're more of a Halo guy than me.
[47:03.100 --> 47:04.800]  All I ever did was...
[47:05.720 --> 47:06.300]  Halo Protest.
[47:08.280 --> 47:09.600]  I'll go ODST.
[47:11.740 --> 47:12.700]  Halo ODST
[47:14.520 --> 47:16.480]  is the fourth most popular answer.
[47:16.640 --> 47:17.060]  Okay.
[47:24.140 --> 47:25.480]  It's Halo 3 ODST.
[47:25.780 --> 47:26.320]  Get it right.
[47:27.060 --> 47:27.780]  I'm good.
[47:31.620 --> 47:33.400]  What do you think, Gavin?
[47:33.400 --> 47:35.120]  Halo, Halo 4 or 5.
[47:35.240 --> 47:37.140]  I'm assuming it's going to be one of those fellas.
[47:37.980 --> 47:39.240]  Would people put Halo Wars
[47:39.240 --> 47:40.280]  above Halo?
[47:40.700 --> 47:42.640]  No, it wasn't very popular at all.
[47:44.200 --> 47:45.580]  Would people put...
[47:45.580 --> 47:47.460]  I would say 5
[47:47.460 --> 47:49.580]  wasn't popular. 4 was kind of popular.
[47:50.220 --> 47:51.400]  I feel like...
[47:52.340 --> 47:53.780]  4 is not better than 1.
[47:54.680 --> 47:55.500]  No, of course not.
[47:55.900 --> 47:56.840]  So let's say Halo 1.
[47:57.200 --> 47:58.400]  Halo Combat Evolved.
[47:59.800 --> 48:00.720]  Halo 1
[48:00.720 --> 48:02.080]  is their guess.
[48:03.860 --> 48:04.840]  Halo 1
[48:04.840 --> 48:06.660]  is the least popular
[48:06.660 --> 48:09.020]  game. They run it out.
[48:10.480 --> 48:10.960]  Team
[48:11.440 --> 48:12.520]  GG
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.800]  wins the first
[48:14.800 --> 48:15.580]  episode.
[48:16.400 --> 48:18.060]  The last episode.
[48:18.240 --> 48:20.300]  The last episode of Regulation Feud.
[48:21.440 --> 48:22.780]  I'm so sorry.
[48:23.920 --> 48:25.020]  What do you mean?
[48:25.180 --> 48:27.180]  You could have picked a different...
[48:27.320 --> 48:27.820]  decided.
[48:27.820 --> 48:29.340]  You could have changed it.
[48:29.620 --> 48:31.980]  I guess I could have.
[48:32.200 --> 48:34.020]  You should have made that suggestion at the time.
[48:34.560 --> 48:35.540]  That was the
[48:35.540 --> 48:37.160]  contestant's fault on that one.
[48:37.760 --> 48:39.140]  Winners, GG.
[48:40.300 --> 48:41.800]  Losers, Team New England.
[48:43.260 --> 48:43.760]  Listen,
[48:43.940 --> 48:45.780]  shows make mistakes. Nothing's
[48:45.780 --> 48:46.180]  perfect.
[48:48.180 --> 48:49.160]  I will
[48:49.700 --> 48:51.520]  never be participating in another
[48:51.520 --> 48:53.980]  Regulation Feud as long as we are a company.
[48:54.600 --> 48:55.520]  How did this happen?
[48:56.280 --> 48:58.260]  We'll be back next time.
[48:58.300 --> 48:59.660]  Andrew did no prep.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.060]  Andrew blew it.
[49:01.260 --> 49:02.160]  And here we are.
[49:02.400 --> 49:05.240]  I would feel bad about that win if
[49:05.240 --> 49:06.660]  this was any other show.
[49:10.820 --> 49:11.500]  Salad
[49:11.500 --> 49:13.240]  creaming to the...
[49:13.240 --> 49:15.440]  The fact that Eric
[49:15.440 --> 49:17.360]  picked one below what the
[49:17.360 --> 49:19.400]  correct answer was and then Gavin
[49:19.400 --> 49:21.340]  just picked one above his
[49:22.780 --> 49:23.460]  is
[49:23.460 --> 49:24.060]  insane.
[49:25.180 --> 49:26.540]  What is
[49:26.540 --> 49:27.100]  this?
[49:28.140 --> 49:30.620]  Not insane. Absolutely not insane.
[49:30.920 --> 49:31.640]  Pretty crazy.
[49:32.040 --> 49:34.220]  Anyway, thank you so
[49:34.220 --> 49:35.480]  much for watching.
[49:36.180 --> 49:38.100]  Check out our Patreon at the
[49:38.100 --> 49:39.340]  RegulationPod.
[49:40.440 --> 49:41.800]  Regulatrion.com
[49:42.960 --> 49:44.320]  Considering what I
[49:44.320 --> 49:46.300]  erased from the text box
[49:46.300 --> 49:48.240]  before putting it in, that's an insane win.
[49:49.680 --> 49:50.760]  Save your money.
[49:50.760 --> 49:51.500]  I
[49:53.440 --> 49:55.000]  file this under protest.
[49:55.380 --> 49:56.680]  It's under protest.
[49:56.920 --> 49:57.520]  Goodbye.
[50:01.990 --> 50:03.610]  We should do a sync.
[50:04.850 --> 50:05.890]  Just use that.
[50:07.750 --> 50:08.350]  Okay.
[50:08.830 --> 50:09.530]  1, 2, 3.
[50:11.590 --> 50:13.210]  I'm not even recording yet.
[50:13.870 --> 50:14.470]  5,
[50:14.750 --> 50:16.370]  4, 3,
[50:16.610 --> 50:18.490]  2, 1.
[50:18.730 --> 50:19.570]  That was for real.
[50:19.570 --> 50:20.990]  Do you think Andrew turned it down on that one?
[50:21.730 --> 50:23.530]  He's still muted, so maybe not.
[50:24.650 --> 50:25.590]  He did. There's no shot.
[50:25.690 --> 50:27.410]  No, I did, but it was
[50:27.410 --> 50:29.390]  close because I was sharing my screen.
[50:29.950 --> 50:31.030]  Why was it close?
[50:31.270 --> 50:33.790]  Because I was sharing my screen. I was focused on that.
[50:34.030 --> 50:34.730]  With your mouth?
[50:35.090 --> 50:37.550]  Focused? Yeah, my brain was locked
[50:37.550 --> 50:39.310]  in. I'm trying to get
[50:39.310 --> 50:40.990]  things organized. Relax.
[50:41.310 --> 50:42.450]  With your mouth?
[50:44.670 --> 50:45.470]  Yeah, guys.
[50:45.610 --> 50:47.610]  I clicked the live button
[50:47.610 --> 50:49.510]  and then I clicked the two clicks
[50:49.510 --> 50:51.250]  past it. Oh my god.
[50:51.530 --> 50:53.090]  I remembered I had to do it.
[50:53.210 --> 50:54.990]  I was like, I gotta click this.
[50:55.110 --> 50:56.410]  There's like six tabs.
[50:57.250 --> 50:59.510]  We got there. I did it. I did both, but
[50:59.510 --> 51:01.810]  it was definitely a close.
[51:01.950 --> 51:03.170]  I made all three. No problem.
[51:03.450 --> 51:05.230]  Nick, does the sync matter if
[51:05.230 --> 51:07.430]  we didn't get anything with his screen
[51:07.430 --> 51:09.290]  the first time or it doesn't matter to you?
[51:09.330 --> 51:11.530]  No, it's fine. I'll have this to sync to
[51:11.530 --> 51:12.990]  our audio. I'm recording it.
[51:13.350 --> 51:14.570]  Do you remember this, Gavin?
[51:17.920 --> 51:18.780]  There's no shot.
[51:18.860 --> 51:20.240]  He doesn't remember this at all.
[51:20.420 --> 51:21.520]  This is what we were doing?
[51:22.040 --> 51:23.240]  This is what we were doing.
[51:28.760 --> 51:30.020]  What is the O?
[51:30.380 --> 51:31.640]  What do you think it is?
[51:32.340 --> 51:34.240]  I can't wait to hear these two
[51:34.240 --> 51:35.600]  clips sandwiched together.
[51:35.760 --> 51:38.080]  So we're just gonna continue and not mention
[51:38.080 --> 51:38.580]  that it's later?
[51:39.560 --> 51:42.220]  We can do whatever we want. We ended in a way
[51:42.220 --> 51:44.020]  I was like, ah, we gotta end it. We'll do another
[51:44.020 --> 51:45.940]  ending some other time and I just think that sucks.
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.040]  You think that
[51:48.040 --> 51:50.120]  all of this isn't in this right now?
[51:50.640 --> 51:51.160]  That's a good point.
[51:51.960 --> 51:53.880]  I mean, I just started recording like a minute ago.
[51:54.660 --> 51:55.260]  But, yeah, Craig.
[51:55.640 --> 51:56.160]  1, 2, 3.
[51:56.460 --> 51:56.900]  Alright.
[52:00.560 --> 52:02.280]  Here's how we could link it.
[52:04.820 --> 52:05.260]  Uh...
[52:05.940 --> 52:06.820]  Oh, yeah!
[52:07.560 --> 52:08.760]  The grow tube.
[52:10.620 --> 52:11.060]  Okay.
[52:11.560 --> 52:12.660]  Now go ahead and
[52:12.660 --> 52:15.200]  request to me how you think this links up.
