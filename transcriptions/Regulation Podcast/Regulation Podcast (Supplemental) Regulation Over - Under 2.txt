[00:00.720 --> 00:04.640]  Welcome to another episode of Regulation Over Under.
[00:05.360 --> 00:10.600]  Uh, it's a game that we played once before, but I don't think Geoff participated. I'm Eric. I'm here
[00:10.600 --> 00:17.000]  with Andrew, Gavin, and now Geoff for the first time ever. I definitely didn't play it last time
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.380]  and I am very excited to play it with you guys this time. Uh, what did you say the game was
[00:20.380 --> 00:24.740]  called again? Regulation Over Under. Oh, okay. It's weird. It looks to me like it's called IMDB
[00:24.740 --> 00:29.280]  Higher or Lower Game, but... Well, that's because we're using higherorlowergame.com, you dunce,
[00:29.280 --> 00:35.820]  because that is where we are going to get our ratings for this first leg of the game. Last
[00:35.820 --> 00:39.680]  time we did some box office results and that is what we're going to go with. That's what we're
[00:39.680 --> 00:43.940]  going to start with again last time or this time. That's because last time, I think I used a
[00:43.940 --> 00:52.680]  different site. This time I'm using higherorlowergame.com. These get updated, uh, every so
[00:52.680 --> 00:58.120]  often. I want to say 2024 was the last time the box office movies were updated, so we'll have to
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.340]  see. But guys, this is a simple game. It's going to give you two and you're going to tell me which
[01:03.340 --> 01:08.860]  one is the higher of the box office scores. Does that all make sense, Gavin? Is that coming through?
[01:09.080 --> 01:14.540]  Higher gross? Is that what you mean by box office score? Yeah. Okay. I have a question for Andrew.
[01:15.080 --> 01:19.760]  Yeah, okay. Do you remember all six movies that were over a billion dollars? No, I don't. I was
[01:19.760 --> 01:23.720]  going to say those so Geoff knows. Only six, because he wasn't there. You got to remember, Geoff, only
[01:23.720 --> 01:30.060]  six over a billion. I feel like I could name those. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? Shockingly,
[01:30.100 --> 01:37.140]  you might be able to name more than six, but we're going to get started here. Box office movies.
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.700]  This was updated in August of 2024, so something to keep in mind. We're going to get going right
[01:43.700 --> 01:52.320]  now. Guys, Sing 2016 or Speed 1994, which had the higher box office. Now remember,
[01:53.020 --> 02:00.000]  Get Ready for Rush Hour, Speed, Keanu, Sandra Bullock, 1994. Sing has... look at all these names
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.500]  for a movie you've never seen. Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Tori Kelly,
[02:04.620 --> 02:10.920]  whoever that is, John C. Reilly, Terran Eggerton, oh, Terran Eggerton, Scarlett Johansson. Wow.
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.280]  The gang's all here. Here's what I'm going to say. I lived through 1994 as an adult,
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.700]  and I lived through Sing 2016 as an adult, and I remember Speed being a big deal,
[02:21.880 --> 02:28.220]  and I don't remember that Sing existed. So I'm thinking maybe Speed. Oh, I don't know. Sing is
[02:28.220 --> 02:34.760]  big. Sing is really big. They were Happy Meal toys. Oh, well, then go with Sing. I've never
[02:34.760 --> 02:39.600]  heard of it. I just I'm surprised Scarlett Johansson has lower billing than Seth MacFarlane,
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.080]  but I guess it is a singing thing. Is it animated? It is animated. Yeah,
[02:44.140 --> 02:49.320]  it's like an animated singing contest thing. Yeah, it's got this. It's got like this.
[02:49.940 --> 02:53.340]  What is this? Some kind of animal. Koala. Up at the top. No, it's a koala.
[02:53.660 --> 02:58.580]  They hid the main character of the show in a window at the top of the poster. Oh,
[02:58.640 --> 03:05.060]  is Sing the movie with Nick Kroll is like a pig? Maybe. I don't know. He didn't make the marquee.
[03:05.060 --> 03:09.980]  Why isn't he on the bloody sign? Because they had to make room for Seth MacFarlane.
[03:10.720 --> 03:15.440]  Taron Egerton had to be on there. I am worried that Speed got less. I mean,
[03:15.520 --> 03:21.100]  partly for inflation and also I feel like some of these big old blockbuster summer
[03:21.100 --> 03:25.020]  movies from the 90s didn't actually do that well at the box office. Oh, interesting.
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.660]  They did well at the box office for the time. Yeah, for the time. So there's three of you,
[03:29.720 --> 03:34.080]  so we can never have a tie, which is nice. So I'm going to let you guys vote. Which one do
[03:34.080 --> 03:37.820]  you think is the higher grossing here? I'm voting Sing. There's like three Sing movies,
[03:37.940 --> 03:41.600]  I think. I vote Sing, hoping that it's actually Speed. I'm going to vote Speed,
[03:41.740 --> 03:49.060]  knowing that I'll be wrong. Okay, Sing it is. Here it is. $634 million to $350 million. Guys,
[03:49.160 --> 03:58.620]  you are 1-0. Now, Sing is $634 million or Guardians of the Galaxy from 2014. Which is
[03:58.620 --> 04:03.740]  the higher of the two? Can I ask a question real fast? Absolutely. Is this domestic or international?
[04:04.080 --> 04:09.680]  No, it has to be international. No, I believe it's international. Because there are six movies
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.800]  over a billion dollars, as you know. It's got to be Guardians then. Could you imagine a domestic
[04:14.800 --> 04:21.420]  movie, Geoff, that made $634 million that you weren't aware of? I mean, yeah, I'm pretty
[04:21.420 --> 04:26.700]  clueless these days. I mean, it's impressive. That's a lot of people seeing it. I don't think
[04:26.700 --> 04:33.000]  clueless made that much. I still had no knowledge of a movie that made $600 million across our
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.280]  beautiful world, which is interconnected via the internet. Speaking of $600 million,
[04:37.580 --> 04:41.240]  that's the number that it has to beat. So is Guardians of the Galaxy higher or lower? I
[04:41.240 --> 04:49.040]  think Guardians is higher. Okay, Guardians of the Galaxy is your pick. And it made $773 million.
[04:50.680 --> 04:58.100]  Next, Madagascar escaped the number two Africa from 2008. It's a Ben Stiller joint. Yeah.
[04:58.850 --> 05:04.580]  What do you guys think? Those movies are huge. They were big. I was the right age demographic
[05:04.580 --> 05:10.180]  for them. So maybe they felt bigger than they were. Once again, Happy Meal Toy situation.
[05:10.880 --> 05:17.280]  Lemurs were the first minions, I would say. People fucking love those little guys and
[05:17.280 --> 05:24.400]  they do their dumb song. They were like the weird subset. I'm going to tweet right now,
[05:24.400 --> 05:31.660]  Lemurs were the first minions. Is it Chris Rock in Madagascar? Yeah, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith,
[05:31.840 --> 05:37.900]  David Schwimmer, and Ben Stiller. Yeah. I'm going to say under because of the time period.
[05:39.500 --> 05:44.080]  Thoughts, boys? Tough. I think Guardians made more money. I know they made a third one and
[05:44.080 --> 05:49.560]  that's actually the best one, but that one was kind of disappointing. Gavin? Lower. Okay,
[05:49.560 --> 05:54.300]  so do you think Guardians of the Galaxy made more? Yeah, let's go Guardians. Got it. Guardians.
[05:54.680 --> 06:06.100]  Oh, 603 for Madagascar too, so Guardians was more, but now... Minions. As we know, Lemurs were the
[06:06.100 --> 06:11.800]  first minions. Holy shit. I gotta go. Minions. People fucking love those minions. They're
[06:11.800 --> 06:16.800]  everywhere. Did they love them from the get-go, though, or did they... No, well, here's the
[06:16.800 --> 06:23.200]  thing. They had like two or three Despicable Me's before this came out. Oh, right. Minions was not
[06:23.200 --> 06:29.140]  the first Minions. They got their own movie because of how loved they were from Despicable Me.
[06:30.200 --> 06:35.880]  It's gotta be Minions, then. It's gotta be Minions. Yeah, I like... I just want to...
[06:35.880 --> 06:40.580]  Looking at these movie posters, this is the most 2008 thing where it is the loudest,
[06:40.580 --> 06:46.360]  greenest thing that is like slamming in your face, and this is just banal, and it says,
[06:46.480 --> 06:52.000]  uh-oh. That's awesome. It's the Apple Store of posters. Yeah, no kidding. So you guys are going
[06:52.000 --> 07:01.280]  with Minions as the higher, yes? Yes. Okay, 603 million for Madagascar too. Minions, one of the
[07:01.280 --> 07:12.920]  six, over a billion dollars. Wow. Now, Minions or Uncharted, a movie that I saw in theaters.
[07:13.020 --> 07:16.860]  You've seen Uncharted? You're the first person I've ever met that has seen Uncharted.
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.920]  Congratulations. I saw that movie in theaters with Michael Jones, and then when the guy who
[07:22.920 --> 07:28.020]  voices Nathan Drake shows up in the movie as like an Easter egg, he leaned over to me and he went,
[07:28.860 --> 07:38.080]  that's Nathan Drake. This movie sucked. But whether it sucks or not has no bearing on how
[07:38.080 --> 07:42.980]  much money it made. I think it does. Minions over a billion. Well, Minions made over a billion,
[07:43.480 --> 07:49.170]  so what do you guys think? Which one made more here? I mean, it does have Antonio Banderas in it.
[07:50.210 --> 07:58.370]  Loa. Yeah. Yeah. Minions definitely made more money. Okay. Minions, it is 400. I'm amazed it
[07:58.370 --> 08:06.750]  made that much money. That had to all be overseas. Okay. And now it's Uncharted 2022 at 407 million
[08:06.750 --> 08:14.170]  versus 300 Rise of an Empire. And I want to be clear that this is 300 Rise of an Empire from
[08:14.170 --> 08:20.550]  2014, not the 300 movie that people have seen. Right. I've never seen this. I didn't know this
[08:20.550 --> 08:24.390]  existed. Maybe. You got to think about international for a minute. Is this the one
[08:24.390 --> 08:30.990]  that Eva Green was in? Yes. Was she in this? Why did you say yes? I don't even know who Eva Green
[08:30.990 --> 08:37.330]  is. Why did you say yes? Well, because I, I, that feels right, but she's also in Sin City,
[08:37.510 --> 08:41.170]  a Dame to Kill for. And I was like, is she just in these weird sequels that nobody saw?
[08:41.170 --> 08:44.970]  I only know her from Casino Royale. Sounds like you know her from 300 Rise of the Empire.
[08:45.390 --> 08:52.570]  Like tonally. It would be very funny if Eva Green is in both 300 Rise of an Empire and Sin City a
[08:52.570 --> 09:01.290]  Dame to Kill for. Just like two late sequels. I'm Uncharted. I was doing a box office league
[09:01.290 --> 09:07.650]  when 300 Rise of an Empire came out. So I'm aware that like it kind of underperformed
[09:09.350 --> 09:14.430]  domestically. Underperformed. Well, I think if you make a 300 sequel, you have some expectation
[09:14.430 --> 09:19.210]  of what it will return. And based on those expectations, it didn't deliver. Definitely
[09:19.210 --> 09:24.430]  didn't match the original. However, international is tricky. I feel like with a movie like 300
[09:24.430 --> 09:32.170]  Rise of an Empire. I think I think $400 million is a lot to beat for for that hunk of shit.
[09:32.570 --> 09:36.930]  When by the way, Uncharted looks like an absolute hunk of shit. So it's like it's like picking
[09:36.930 --> 09:42.310]  what's worse, a dog turd or a horse turd. Yeah, I'd go Uncharted as the higher one.
[09:42.570 --> 09:46.150]  OK, Uncharted from Andrew. Geoff, what do you think? I'm definitely Uncharted.
[09:46.450 --> 09:49.250]  And Gavin, what do you think? Yeah, I think I'm going to do the same.
[09:49.710 --> 09:54.730]  OK, Uncharted, we're saying is the higher of the two. Let's see. $407 million.
[09:56.430 --> 10:02.750]  Wow, $337 million for a movie I've never heard of. Pretty exciting. Oh, 300 Rise of an Empire
[10:02.750 --> 10:08.070]  at $337 million. Star Wars Episode four, A New Hope from 1977.
[10:08.710 --> 10:10.490]  Yeah, but is this going to include all the re-releases?
[10:10.910 --> 10:13.750]  I don't believe so. I think this is just from 1977.
[10:14.310 --> 10:17.410]  Because it made a couple hundred million in like 98 or 99.
[10:18.090 --> 10:22.830]  When everyone was seeing Star Wars like 15 times in theaters, was that the first one or was that
[10:22.830 --> 10:29.290]  the later ones? Like Bernie, Bernie saw Star Wars like 42 times the summer came out or something.
[10:30.510 --> 10:34.390]  Wow. Yeah, like he said, it became a thing where everybody in his family wanted to take him to see
[10:34.390 --> 10:39.130]  it. So I guess he had 40 people in his family. I could see A New Hope being higher.
[10:39.470 --> 10:40.510]  But it's $77.
[10:42.690 --> 10:48.330]  Here's the deal. A New Hope is definitely higher if it includes the multiple re-releases. If it
[10:48.330 --> 10:50.650]  doesn't, I don't think there's any way it touches 300 million.
[10:50.950 --> 10:57.350]  So I did, I was doing a thing where I looked at like the top 10 highest box office from 1970
[10:57.350 --> 11:04.430]  to like 2022 or something. And there were movies I remember in the 70s being like
[11:04.430 --> 11:12.330]  comparable to what I felt was big releases now for domestic. Like A Love Story made an insane
[11:12.330 --> 11:15.950]  amount of money. Let's go Star Wars then. I would go Star Wars. Andrew seems to be,
[11:16.170 --> 11:19.590]  Andrew seems to be making the case for Star Wars and then not committing.
[11:19.910 --> 11:25.110]  Well, first of all, I've never seen this movie. I also, it came out way before my time. Like I've
[11:25.110 --> 11:30.390]  I'm the worst point of reference for this. It came out before all, I was two years old when it
[11:30.390 --> 11:35.250]  came out. It came out before all of our time. Uh, I, I, I'm okay with trying Star Wars. Uh,
[11:35.310 --> 11:39.890]  I just, that's a lot of money to make in 1977, but it wasn't, I mean, it was a huge phenomenon.
[11:40.210 --> 11:43.990]  People saw it so many times. This was, and it was just called Star Wars, this one, right? It
[11:43.990 --> 11:48.070]  wasn't actually called episode four yet. Not yet. Uh, yeah. I think it was just called Star Wars.
[11:48.330 --> 11:53.750]  Yeah. Let's say Star Wars. I'd say Star Wars. Okay. Here we go. Star Wars, 337 million.
[11:54.830 --> 12:00.130]  Wow. That has got to include its re-releases. That can't be the box from back then. Otherwise
[12:00.130 --> 12:04.130]  it would have been the highest grossing film of all time until Titanic. And it wasn't. That's
[12:04.130 --> 12:11.110]  incredible. Yeah. And now it's head to head with Kong Skull Island from 2017. Oh, that was a pretty
[12:11.110 --> 12:16.110]  good movie. This one has like the China factor, doesn't it? Like I bet China watched the shit
[12:16.110 --> 12:22.530]  out of this movie. China factor. You think Star Wars is lacking the China factor?
[12:25.190 --> 12:32.030]  Oh yeah, this is... I wonder how many more movie theaters there are in China in 2025 versus 1977.
[12:33.030 --> 12:38.210]  I will say, and this is just, I don't know, I don't know how much weight we want to put into
[12:38.210 --> 12:44.670]  this, but Kong Skull Island ends in a way that they're setting up for more story that they never
[12:44.670 --> 12:51.210]  deliver on, which makes me wonder if financially it did not hit what they were hoping for. But
[12:51.210 --> 12:57.650]  didn't it result in Godzilla Kong movie? I didn't see those, but I don't think Tom Hiddleston or
[12:57.650 --> 13:02.190]  the the other person ever came back and it felt like they were central to what they were setting
[13:02.190 --> 13:07.990]  up. John C. Reilly? He was in that one, right? I didn't see him. Yes, John C. Reilly is in Kong
[13:07.990 --> 13:12.170]  Skull Island. He was the best part of that movie, right? He's like, we're all gonna die. I don't
[13:12.170 --> 13:17.990]  even remember him. You're good boys, you're good boys. I remember Eli from Boardwalk with his
[13:17.990 --> 13:24.730]  grenades. Oh, that was awesome. That part was so good. You shouldn't have come to this island.
[13:26.250 --> 13:34.030]  I would guess lower, to be honest. You think Kong Skull Island is under the 775 million of Star Wars?
[13:34.330 --> 13:38.670]  I do. Yeah, let's do it. Otherwise, it would be a hugely talked about movie, wouldn't it?
[13:38.670 --> 13:42.770]  It felt like it was inescapable at the time because everyone talked to me about it. But
[13:42.770 --> 13:49.850]  Star Wars Episode 4 is what we're going with as the higher. Oh, Kong Skull Island, 568 million
[13:50.530 --> 13:56.490]  as it is shuffled out. And now Kong Skull Island's 568 million against Casino Royale.
[13:56.730 --> 14:03.610]  Does that have Eva Green in it? Yes. Who's Eva Green? The star of 302,
[14:03.610 --> 14:11.070]  Eva Green. I look up Eva Green. Oh, yeah, I know her. So what do you think, Gavin? What's
[14:11.070 --> 14:18.290]  your gut telling you right here? To be honest, I think I'm always surprised at how low these Bond
[14:18.290 --> 14:25.370]  movie box office results are. Oh, is that right? You think it did less than 568 million globally?
[14:25.910 --> 14:30.190]  I'd be shocked. Maybe not less than that, but I feel like it's going to be similar because
[14:30.750 --> 14:35.010]  Bond was pretty... Bond was in the shitter at this point when this movie came out.
[14:35.430 --> 14:39.890]  That's definitely true. Bond was in the shitter until this movie came out. This was the big
[14:39.890 --> 14:45.210]  resurrection and it was like... It was. It was marketed as such, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I think
[14:45.210 --> 14:49.950]  it's definitely over. I think it's got to be over as well. I think it'll be over, but it's close.
[14:50.590 --> 14:58.470]  Okay. That's like 670 or something. I'm going to go 785. 616! Barely squeaking over,
[14:58.470 --> 15:05.670]  but next, it's Transformers Age of Extinction from 2014. I don't know which one this is.
[15:05.870 --> 15:09.470]  It is just simply Age of Extinction. It's the Mark Wahlberg one. It's the first, like,
[15:09.510 --> 15:15.790]  kind of reboot one, I think. Or did Bumblebee come out before this? I think it's the only one I've
[15:15.790 --> 15:22.890]  ever seen. Is this the T.J. Miller one? Yes. Okay. I think that made a lot of money. But did it make
[15:22.890 --> 15:29.270]  more than 616 million? I have no idea about this one. All these movies make so much money. At least
[15:29.270 --> 15:35.870]  the first three did. I mean, I bet it made 300 million in the U.S. alone. Also, I forget the
[15:35.870 --> 15:41.910]  sequencing. Like, is this before The Last Knight? Is this post The Last Knight? Oh, that's the one
[15:41.910 --> 15:46.890]  I've seen, The Last Knight. What is The Last Knight? It's the Anthony Hopkins Transformers
[15:46.890 --> 15:55.330]  movie. What? Fuck it. That sentence fucking sucks shit. That sucks. I think that Transformers does
[15:55.330 --> 16:01.870]  really well globally, too. I think I would tend to lean towards Transformers. Gavin, what's the
[16:01.870 --> 16:08.290]  China factor feel on this one? I reckon China probably put in at least 500 mil of its own.
[16:08.310 --> 16:12.370]  Right? Yeah. Do you think this is going to be one of the six? It could be. To be honest,
[16:12.430 --> 16:15.590]  it would not surprise me if this was one of the six. Well, let's do it. All right,
[16:15.590 --> 16:20.070]  then. Let's go with Transformers Age of Extinction 2014 to beat 616 million.
[16:20.770 --> 16:28.010]  What? One of the six? For one billion, it's one of the six. But now, boys, it's tough because
[16:28.010 --> 16:33.070]  Transformers Age of Extinction is going head to head with Transformers Dark of the Moon. Dark of
[16:33.070 --> 16:41.270]  the Moon. Could this be two of the six on the same page? Oh, shit. Fuck. What made more? What
[16:41.830 --> 16:49.270]  made more? One billion dollars is what we're looking at for Transformers Age of Extinction.
[16:49.410 --> 16:55.130]  One billion, one hundred and four million dollars. Transformers Dark of the Moon. What do you think?
[16:55.410 --> 17:01.130]  The question is, was Age of Extinction riding the high of what people view as one of the
[17:01.130 --> 17:10.330]  good Transformers movies? Based on the poster, yes. Or was the decline from Dark of the Moon downwards?
[17:11.270 --> 17:14.510]  It is almost the exact same Dark of the Moon sucked.
[17:17.510 --> 17:24.810]  Oh, God, that's really funny. That is a shocking similarity there. Just glancing at them. The
[17:24.810 --> 17:30.750]  woman is in the exact same spot. That's crazy. I can't see the woman because of the text.
[17:31.090 --> 17:36.570]  I don't think that's Megan Fox. I think this is the one without Megan Fox. Rosie Huntington
[17:37.010 --> 17:46.270]  Yeah. One of the non-American supermodels. That's true. That's how I knew her from that
[17:46.270 --> 17:52.470]  Trivial Pursuit video. That probably hasn't come out. It's true. And when you're screaming
[17:52.470 --> 18:00.170]  about that in a few months, people are going to remember this. I forgot about that. I have
[18:00.170 --> 18:05.710]  no idea. I would have absolutely no idea about this one. Who's a bigger box office draw? Mark
[18:05.710 --> 18:13.930]  Wahlberg or Shia LaBeouf? I think it's Optimus Prime. Yeah, but he's in both. He's clearly in
[18:13.930 --> 18:18.070]  both. He's right there both times. I mean, his head's kind of cut off in the other one. Yeah,
[18:18.150 --> 18:22.270]  but so is the bottom. I think we're just kind of pushed in a little bit. This is tough.
[18:23.510 --> 18:32.130]  I just can't imagine a Transformers movie with 1.1 billion dollars. I can't imagine the Transformers
[18:32.130 --> 18:36.150]  Dark of the Moon beating 1.1 billion dollars because I can't imagine any Transformers movie
[18:36.150 --> 18:42.010]  making 1.1 billion dollars, but one clearly did. I can't believe that on paper both of these movies
[18:42.010 --> 18:49.150]  are better than Casino Royale. Yeah, yeah, better. On paper, both of these movies are better than
[18:49.150 --> 18:55.710]  anything we've seen so far today. These are the best movies ever made. So this Age of Extinction
[18:55.710 --> 19:01.470]  beat Guardians in 2014. Oh, it's better. Yeah, it didn't just beat it, it beat the shit out of it.
[19:02.590 --> 19:10.170]  Pummeled the shit. Yep. What do you think, boys? Oh, man. It's tough because like quality doesn't
[19:10.170 --> 19:16.050]  matter. Not at all. Zero. No shit. Have a look. Clearly it doesn't matter.
[19:16.050 --> 19:26.590]  Uh. Oh, boy. I would go Age of Extinction, I think. Age of Extinction from Andrew. Gavin,
[19:26.650 --> 19:32.650]  what do you think? But it's 50-50 in my eye. Yeah, there's that like delay like the as the
[19:32.650 --> 19:36.570]  movies go downhill, the box office needs like a movie to realize that they're going downhill.
[19:37.290 --> 19:41.750]  I think Geoff bringing up that we know that that made 1.1 billion makes me want to pick it.
[19:41.990 --> 19:45.010]  I think if we didn't know the number of either, I would probably go Dark of the Moon.
[19:45.550 --> 19:49.530]  Yeah. All right. I'm fine with going to Age of Extinction. Geoff,
[19:49.610 --> 19:53.810]  you going to Age of Extinction as well? I mean, majority rule, so my answer doesn't
[19:53.810 --> 19:57.150]  really matter. But yeah, no, no, I would go with Age of Extinction. You're definitely a part of
[19:57.150 --> 20:01.450]  this. Yeah. It's very swayable, if you like. No, no, I know. I think we're all pretty,
[20:01.610 --> 20:04.770]  we're all pretty malleable right now. I could be bought as well.
[20:08.710 --> 20:12.250]  I'm ready to sell out. I wonder which one of these movies Michael Bay likes more.
[20:12.810 --> 20:17.710]  Oh, great question. Probably the one that made the most money. Yeah, probably, I would think so.
[20:17.930 --> 20:23.770]  Transformers Age of Extinction, 1.1 billion dollars is what we're choosing over Transformers
[20:23.770 --> 20:34.170]  Dark of the Moon. Here we go. Whoa! Dark of the Moon! Dark of the Moon, 1.123 billion dollars.
[20:34.630 --> 20:42.130]  Wow. Guys, guys, you got 10. That was a tough question there. That was a really tough one.
[20:42.250 --> 20:47.890]  That's the way it goes with regulation over under. You never know. You never know what it could be.
[20:48.050 --> 20:53.090]  You know what would be a torturous piece of content for us to create? What's that? We're
[20:53.090 --> 20:57.530]  doing Wheel of Decades right now, which is TV based, and we're currently watching Charmed,
[20:57.550 --> 21:00.150]  and then we're going to have to vote again real soon to see if we're going to continue to watch
[21:00.150 --> 21:04.110]  Charmed or not. What if we had a wheel where we had to watch movie franchises, and we ended up
[21:04.110 --> 21:09.850]  having to watch all 900 Transformers movies? Oh, I just don't even want to broach that.
[21:09.850 --> 21:17.090]  I tried to watch the first one three separate times, and I just couldn't get past 45 minutes
[21:17.090 --> 21:21.430]  any of the three times. The Linkin Park one? And that's a good one, considering. Yeah,
[21:21.750 --> 21:25.150]  I know. I saw the night one because it was on a plane and I had nothing else to do, and it was
[21:25.930 --> 21:33.550]  atrocious. Yeah. Well, I think the second one was the first time I started yawning in the middle of
[21:33.550 --> 21:41.590]  an action scene. Brutal. God. Well, boys, your score here was tough, but we're going to go into
[21:41.590 --> 21:48.950]  another one. And this is a Spotify higher or lower game. This is going to be artists, monthly
[21:49.650 --> 21:57.770]  listeners. Love it. This was updated in January of 2025. So January of this year, higher or lower
[21:57.770 --> 22:02.970]  on these monthly listeners. I'm so excited for you guys to have a choice here. Sum 41 and Pearl
[22:02.970 --> 22:09.530]  Jam. Who had the higher monthly listeners? All right, everybody, roll your brains back six months.
[22:10.830 --> 22:17.890]  I would assume Pearl Jam. You would assume Pearl Jam just based on quality of music. But I will say
[22:17.890 --> 22:23.190]  Sum 41 is going through some sort of a resurgence in the last year or so. I feel like they just put
[22:23.190 --> 22:27.670]  out their final album. They did without their drummer. When did they put it out, though? Did
[22:27.670 --> 22:34.530]  they put it out before January? I think around January. Yeah, maybe not. I would still go Pearl
[22:34.530 --> 22:39.650]  Jam. All right, let's go. I'll go Pearl Jam as well. Gavin, what do you think? Sure. Pearl Jam,
[22:40.130 --> 22:45.590]  14 million. Oh, Sum 41 with nine. So we got Pearl Jam going up against Rich the Kid. Gavin,
[22:46.010 --> 22:50.470]  what do you think about Rich the Kid and his success alongside Pearl Jam? Never heard of
[22:50.470 --> 22:54.590]  Rich the Kid, so I assume much more successful than Pearl Jam. Yeah, but what about the China
[22:54.590 --> 22:58.790]  factor with Rich the Kid? I don't know how the China factor works with music. I'm not sure. I
[22:58.790 --> 23:06.710]  have no information. It's Spotify in China. Any time it is older artist against an artist named
[23:06.710 --> 23:11.710]  The Kid, I'm always going to go The Kid. We going with The Kid? Yeah, my line of thinking as well
[23:11.710 --> 23:17.470]  is this is somebody who is clearly young that I have never heard of, so they must be massive.
[23:17.890 --> 23:23.470]  All right. All right. Rich the Kid going up against Pearl Jam's 14 million monthly listens.
[23:23.470 --> 23:30.630]  Rich the Kid, five million. Boys are sunk. We suck. Can we do that one again? You want to do
[23:30.630 --> 23:34.430]  that one more time? Yeah, let's do that one more time. It's no problem. Cardi B against Charlie
[23:34.430 --> 23:44.310]  XCX. Now remember, this is January. Yeah, but still probably riding a little bit high off.
[23:44.430 --> 23:51.350]  I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty close. 32 million. Yeah. 32 million for Charlie XCX. Oh no. Against
[23:51.350 --> 23:57.830]  Kygo. What do you think? Kygo? Kygo. Kygo. Kygo. It looks like EDM, not my wheelhouse. I'm going
[23:57.830 --> 24:01.530]  to stick with Charlie XCX because I don't want it to be him just based on his hat.
[24:02.950 --> 24:06.550]  Just based on his hat? Well, it's the way he's wearing his hat and making that face
[24:06.550 --> 24:12.690]  just tells me I don't, I just, I would rather her have the success. He does have a Billy the
[24:12.690 --> 24:20.270]  Bass look in that photo. Tough. Tough. Yeah, Charlie. Okay, Charlie. And Gavin, what do you
[24:20.270 --> 24:25.370]  think? Are you still celebrating a brat summer at this point? I think so. Yeah. Okay. He looks
[24:25.370 --> 24:30.290]  like a bully's sidekick in the nineties. Oh, I can see it with the hat. Yeah. He looks like the
[24:30.290 --> 24:39.750]  guy from Clerks. He does look like Randall. He does. Wow. Look at that. Oh my God. Neck to neck.
[24:39.790 --> 24:47.210]  31 million. But now here's 31 million against Kali Uchis. I mean, Kygo all the way. Kygo as well.
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.890]  Okay. Yeah. In a world of which I don't know either.
[24:55.050 --> 25:03.030]  He lost. My Spotify is so incredibly different than this Spotify. Well, guys, I know that that
[25:03.030 --> 25:06.530]  one's tough. We can do it one more time, but I have another one locked and loaded. If you're
[25:06.530 --> 25:10.690]  not feeling the Spotify one, I know it's. Let's do another one. I think we know. You want to,
[25:10.770 --> 25:14.710]  you want a different one? Yeah. Okay. Shield your eyes. Shield your eyes. Cause you're not
[25:14.710 --> 25:20.950]  going to like what we're about to see. All right. Guess which Mr. Beast video has more views on
[25:20.950 --> 25:28.670]  YouTube. A game of higher or lower video stats for Mr. Beast updated July, 2024. Guys. Now,
[25:28.750 --> 25:37.510]  which of these is going to have, he's suck. Last YouTuber to leave wins $100,000 challenge. Or I
[25:37.510 --> 25:44.550]  built Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Gavin China factor. Which one? Oh man. I try to think if I've
[25:44.550 --> 25:49.950]  ever seen one of these videos. I also, who are all those YouTubers? What do you mean? They're well,
[25:49.990 --> 25:55.190]  one of them has a hundred thousand dollars. Okay. So, you know, I feel like the ones with money in
[25:55.190 --> 26:03.770]  the title might do better. Uh-huh. Yeah. But I've also never seen any of these. Uh-huh. I'm going
[26:03.770 --> 26:11.050]  off of the one that uses an established brand already. Oh, smart. Very smart. Geoff, any thoughts?
[26:11.050 --> 26:18.350]  His face is going to be bigger on that thumbnail. I will say also, yeah, there's got to be broader
[26:18.350 --> 26:26.210]  reach. The funnel's got to be bigger for a Wonka video then. Although Gavin's right about money,
[26:26.330 --> 26:30.430]  putting money in the title is a big deal. I would, I would argue that that's probably most
[26:30.430 --> 26:35.410]  of the reason that dude is successful to begin with. Gotta make a choice here. Which one has
[26:35.410 --> 26:41.030]  more views? Andrew says Wonka. Oh, I'll say Wonka. It's two for Wonka. Gavin,
[26:41.250 --> 26:45.030]  Gavin, do you still think it's the YouTube one or do you think it might be Wonka? I'll Wonka it up.
[26:45.570 --> 26:53.450]  Okay. Well, Wonka, 308 million to 103 million, not even close. So now it's the 308 million of
[26:53.450 --> 27:00.190]  I built Willy Wonka's chocolate factory to donating $100,000 to random streamers. Knowing that that
[27:00.190 --> 27:05.030]  guy does essentially the same thing we used to do and he gets 308 million views a video,
[27:05.030 --> 27:10.190]  makes me just, just so you guys are aware when we're done recording, I'm going to kill myself.
[27:10.270 --> 27:14.950]  I'm going to go. I mean, that's, I might not make this stream later today. I mean, that's fine. As
[27:14.950 --> 27:19.850]  long as maybe we get the high score on the Mr. Beast YouTube video count videos, then I think
[27:19.850 --> 27:25.190]  that's fine, man. This, this has got, we, and also take a picture like Mr. Beast and this can be the
[27:25.190 --> 27:36.790]  thumbnail of you to do. I guess how many views Mr. Beast has. Yeah. I gotta live long enough
[27:36.790 --> 27:40.970]  to Photoshop myself into that thumbnail. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Sorry, man. You
[27:40.970 --> 27:47.990]  have to keep it going. Um, now 308 million tough to beat, but donating $100,000 to random streamers
[27:47.990 --> 27:53.070]  is a, do those streamers drive a lot of traffic to Mr. Beast? Who knows? Uh, what are you guys
[27:53.070 --> 28:02.430]  thinking? What's more popular chocolate or tits? Oh, they gotta be neck and neck, man. Hmm. Gavin
[28:02.430 --> 28:08.690]  has a good point. I'm sticking with Wonka. I think. Cause he was doing, he does a chocolate thing,
[28:08.750 --> 28:14.590]  right? So like this probably was tied to that. And then that's a shareable thing. And he, 300
[28:14.590 --> 28:20.970]  million views is just a, it's a, it's a huge mountain to overcome. I mean, not, not for beast.
[28:20.970 --> 28:26.770]  Like this video could do 250 million views and it would be a, you know, that it's an insane amount,
[28:26.850 --> 28:32.070]  but it'd still be almost 60 million views under that one. I'm going to stay with Wonka. He's in
[28:32.070 --> 28:38.190]  the thumbnail. I'm going to stay. Uh, I think Wonka. Sure. Yeah. Wonka it is. 308 million.
[28:39.070 --> 28:46.210]  Oh, see only 63. Wow. Only 63 million. What a failure. Can a glowing 1000 degree sword slice
[28:46.210 --> 28:52.970]  a car in half? Uh, does that have more or less than the 63 million? And that sounds like old
[28:52.970 --> 28:59.850]  Mr. Beast to me. I think that has less. That seems like a 20 million view video. That is
[29:00.770 --> 29:08.650]  what we are dealing in such insane numbers. I know. I know. Um, uh,
[29:10.650 --> 29:14.350]  I mean, he's not in either thumbnail, so you got to remove that from the equation.
[29:14.350 --> 29:18.250]  Well, we're only seeing half the thumbnail. That's true. And that might be Mr. Beast.
[29:18.710 --> 29:21.110]  Yeah, that could be him with a beard. I haven't seen him with a beard.
[29:22.910 --> 29:27.430]  What's his name? Jimmy? That might be him. Jimmy, Jimmy Donaldson, I think.
[29:28.050 --> 29:30.590]  Oh, I didn't know that. I thought his name was like Jimmy Beast.
[29:31.630 --> 29:37.170]  Jimmy Beast! Yeah, I just never, his name is Mr. Beast. I just, I don't know why I thought.
[29:37.190 --> 29:41.850]  Real Rascal Flatts situation there. Johnny Caviar wants to know how you know about Jimmy Beast. Who
[29:41.850 --> 29:47.890]  told you about Jimmy Beast? He's been talking. Uh, I'm going to go with the $100,000 to random
[29:47.890 --> 29:55.910]  streamers. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'll go with that. Yeah. Geoff? Yeah. Okay. $63 million to $69 million.
[29:56.130 --> 30:03.550]  You lose again. You lose again. Um, but that's okay. To round us out, we're going to do the
[30:03.550 --> 30:08.710]  box office one more time. This will be, this is where it takes us out. The Conjuring 2.
[30:08.710 --> 30:15.630]  Inside out. Inside out. No conversation needed. Don't need it. Uh, yep. They need
[30:15.630 --> 30:22.510]  to conjure some more dollars. $859 million. Yeah. $322 million. Very easy. Inside out
[30:22.510 --> 30:28.350]  against the greatest showman from 2017. Very big, but inside out. Now I know that the greatest
[30:28.350 --> 30:31.910]  showman is a thing that you guys love to talk about all the time, but you have to think about
[30:31.910 --> 30:38.150]  the wider audience. Did, did more people see the greatest showman from 2017? Well,
[30:38.150 --> 30:45.350]  this Hugh Jackman. It is. Any overlap between inside out and the greatest showman? Hugh Jackman
[30:45.350 --> 30:52.130]  isn't in either. Uh, Bill Hader isn't in either. He doesn't pop claws, but he does sing.
[30:53.590 --> 30:58.210]  What if Louis Black was the greatest showman? He's the connector between the two.
[30:58.310 --> 31:02.170]  I think the greatest showman probably made somewhere in the $400 to $500 million range globally.
[31:02.630 --> 31:09.750]  Okay. Uh, so we going inside out? Inside out. Yeah. It's the Pixar factor. $461 million for
[31:09.750 --> 31:14.610]  greatest showman. Good guess, Geoff. So now it's the greatest showman $461 million against Dr.
[31:14.710 --> 31:19.350]  Strange from 2016. Oh, I think Dr. Strange had to do it, right? It's definitely Dr. Strange. We're
[31:19.350 --> 31:23.970]  still in prime Marvel. We're still building towards the Thanos thing. Yeah. We're still
[31:23.970 --> 31:27.330]  at the point where we would watch anything if it had Marvel studios at the front. Yeah,
[31:27.330 --> 31:31.970]  pretty much. Absolutely. So you guys going Dr. Strange? Yep. Absolutely.
[31:32.970 --> 31:42.810]  Dr. Doctor, give me the news. I got a bad case of Dr. Strange. $677 million against The Grinch
[31:42.810 --> 31:49.270]  from 2018. Oh, I bet they'd go The Grinch. People love The Grinch. Yeah. Tyler, the creator,
[31:49.650 --> 31:55.430]  doing a song for it. It's another illumination joint. It's a holiday film. Oh, but this isn't
[31:55.430 --> 32:01.910]  Jim Carrey one. No, no, no, no. This is 2018. Wait, isn't this the same guy? Is it? I don't
[32:01.910 --> 32:04.890]  know who did The Grinch for it. I don't know who did The Grinch in 2018. Isn't he The Grinch?
[32:05.610 --> 32:10.130]  I don't know. Is he? Look up who did the voice for Grinch 2018. I think it's the same guy.
[32:10.650 --> 32:15.510]  This might be a head-to-head battle with one head. Oh, shit. You know what? Louis Black. Holy shit,
[32:15.570 --> 32:20.350]  it is. It's Benedict Cumberbatch. He was both. Oh, wow. That's crazy. That's crazy. I still
[32:20.350 --> 32:25.310]  think it's The Grinch, personally. Yeah, I'm going The Grinch. Oh, wow. I don't even know.
[32:25.310 --> 32:35.010]  Yeah, sure. All right. Well, let's see if The Grinch can pull it out. No! 540 million dollars.
[32:35.210 --> 32:42.390]  And there's Tom Cruise. So sad looking at you. This is no chance of an Oscar with that performance.
[32:43.090 --> 32:47.190]  You're going to do better next time. And look at how sad he is, boys. Andrew, as a man who has
[32:47.190 --> 32:51.670]  recently seen every single Tom Cruise movie, can you name this film just by the scene? Yeah,
[32:51.670 --> 32:55.770]  Mission Impossible 3. It's him in the chair. Okay, there you go. Oh, wow. Most iconic tear.
[32:56.110 --> 33:02.770]  What word is he saying here? Don't. He's saying don't because he's going to kill. It's in the
[33:02.770 --> 33:06.610]  beginning. And then he shoots him in the face. Well, he shoots her in the face. I thought you
[33:06.610 --> 33:12.630]  were saying no. Well, boys, your highest score was 10. Regulation over under. It's a rough go.
[33:13.590 --> 33:17.470]  We can end it here. We can play another round. What are you guys feeling? I mean,
[33:17.470 --> 33:21.210]  I don't ever want to stop recording. What if you did a ratings one? What am I going to do? Go back
[33:21.210 --> 33:26.430]  to my real life? No, thank you. Oh, go to more games. Well, if you insist. Now we have movie
[33:26.430 --> 33:35.230]  ratings. Yeah, try it. This is movie ratings based on the IMDb movie rating stats from February of
[33:35.750 --> 33:43.470]  2025. Okay, so these are community stats from this year, February of this year. Now, which
[33:43.470 --> 33:48.630]  has the higher rating, Book of Eli or The Extraterrestrial?
[33:50.330 --> 33:55.310]  We'll say people love Book of Eli, but E.T. It's a great movie. It has to be E.T. It's got to be
[33:55.310 --> 34:02.130]  E.T. I've never seen it written that way. The Extraterrestrial? Yeah, it looks weird. It's
[34:02.130 --> 34:07.350]  just the... Yo, man, you guys see The Extraterrestrial yet? I don't think I've ever met
[34:07.350 --> 34:11.610]  somebody who didn't like Book of Eli, but I also don't think I've ever met anybody who didn't like
[34:11.610 --> 34:16.770]  E.T. I was blown away in the last half of E.T. when it was revealed that he was blind the entire
[34:16.770 --> 34:22.590]  time. I could not believe it. I think the ending of Book of Eli is so fucking goofy that it makes
[34:22.590 --> 34:29.950]  the rest of the movie so disregardable. It's so dumb. Oh, I've never seen it. It's the grayest
[34:29.950 --> 34:35.830]  movie in the world. It's very gray. Yeah, it's pretty gray. Desaturate everything. It's crazy.
[34:35.830 --> 34:43.790]  All right. E.T. is what we're picking here. 7.9 against 6.8. Way too close. Way too close.
[34:44.970 --> 34:52.590]  The Patriot! Now, remember, this is The Patriot from 2000. This is pre-911. And also, we're rating
[34:52.590 --> 34:58.590]  based on the movie itself, I assume, and not the personal politics of the man whose face is on the
[34:58.590 --> 35:05.730]  giant poster. It's also pre-fall of Mel Gibson, though. That is true. Yeah. I still think E.T.'s
[35:05.730 --> 35:13.570]  Oh, it's definitely higher. Patriot is not loved, but it is a movie that I enjoy because it was on
[35:13.570 --> 35:20.510]  CBS all the time for me as a kid. Wasn't Heath Ledger in that, too? He sure is. He was, yeah.
[35:20.710 --> 35:26.430]  Interesting that the father and son of the very American pro-American movie, The Patriot,
[35:26.450 --> 35:31.330]  were both Australian. Yep. Something to think about. Are we going with the extraterrestrial?
[35:31.650 --> 35:38.470]  I think, yeah. I don't think there's been a movie in which the villain burns everybody alive in a
[35:38.470 --> 35:45.730]  church that has more than a 7.9. That's just a fact. 7.2. 7.2 is so much higher than I thought.
[35:45.990 --> 35:50.050]  Very close. Now, 7.2 for The Patriot or Prisoners 2013. Get the fuck out of here.
[35:50.410 --> 35:54.490]  All the way. Prisoners is awesome. I've never heard of it. I've never seen it,
[35:54.530 --> 35:58.630]  never heard of it. You guys have not seen Prisoners? Oh my god. It's so good.
[35:58.630 --> 36:05.630]  Don't even know what it is. It's Denny Belleneau before he did Arrival, and it is phenomenal. It
[36:05.630 --> 36:13.410]  is a stunning movie. It's phenomenal. It's phenomenal. It's about Hugh Jackman's child
[36:13.410 --> 36:18.770]  gets abducted, and they're trying to figure out what happened. It's so good. It's so good.
[36:19.210 --> 36:24.270]  There's a maze inside the O. It's the Prisoners. You have to watch Paul Dano be mean to a dog.
[36:24.990 --> 36:27.450]  2013 Prisoners. Do you think it's higher than the 7.2?
[36:27.450 --> 36:33.490]  So much higher. I bet it's like an 8.3. I'm gonna follow Andrew. I don't think it'll be an 8.
[36:34.030 --> 36:36.950]  You don't think it'll be an 8? I think it's definitely an 8.
[36:37.490 --> 36:44.350]  I think 8.3 is like supremely high for IMDb, isn't it? It is, but like this is one of,
[36:44.430 --> 36:47.850]  I think, I think people that watch this movie consider it an all-time great.
[36:48.350 --> 36:50.490]  Oh shit, go for it then. I'd love to see an 8.
[36:50.670 --> 36:54.370]  Okay, Prisoners locking in. Does it beat the 7.2 of The Patriot?
[36:55.230 --> 36:59.350]  8.2! Wow! Way to go, Andrew. Nailed it.
[36:59.510 --> 37:03.830]  Now, now it's the 8.2 Prisoners against The Irishman from 2019.
[37:04.490 --> 37:08.630]  I haven't seen The Irishman, but I feel like all I've heard about it is that it is disappointing.
[37:09.210 --> 37:10.950]  So, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[37:11.050 --> 37:13.330]  It's Prisoners. It's like the de-aged everyone, right?
[37:13.690 --> 37:15.990]  Yeah, but they still move like old people.
[37:17.650 --> 37:18.750]  Yes, it's brutal.
[37:19.350 --> 37:22.050]  I gotta go Prisoners then. It's definitely Prisoners, yeah.
[37:22.050 --> 37:26.890]  As Gavin said, an 8 is a very high number on IMDB.
[37:27.350 --> 37:30.610]  So, tough to beat. So, we're gonna go with Prisoners here.
[37:31.250 --> 37:34.290]  7.8 for The Irishman. Wow, that's so much higher than I would have
[37:34.290 --> 37:39.730]  guessed. The Princess Bride from 1987.
[37:40.510 --> 37:43.290]  Can it beat the 7.8 of The Irishman?
[37:44.290 --> 37:47.230]  I mean, how can you not like The Princess Bride?
[37:47.590 --> 37:50.730]  Once again, I don't know if I've ever met anybody who didn't like The Princess Bride.
[37:50.730 --> 37:57.390]  I mean, on paper, like, there's no way The Irishman is more liked on IMDB than The Princess
[37:57.390 --> 38:00.370]  Bride, right? Like, that just isn't... that's not a thing.
[38:00.930 --> 38:06.310]  Like, if we take away the 7.8 and just look at it as these two movies, it's like without
[38:06.310 --> 38:07.910]  question, right? The Princess Bride.
[38:08.370 --> 38:13.990]  How do you rate a movie on IMDB? Do you have to create an account to do it?
[38:14.330 --> 38:15.450]  I think so, yeah. I bet you do.
[38:15.730 --> 38:18.010]  So, we're dealing with the kind of people...
[38:18.610 --> 38:23.650]  just put ourselves in the mind... the kind of people who create accounts on the internet
[38:23.650 --> 38:28.970]  to rank film, basically only for that purpose and to comment on film.
[38:30.130 --> 38:32.650]  That's a pretty deep film junkie.
[38:33.290 --> 38:34.850]  Yeah, I gotta think Princess Bride.
[38:35.130 --> 38:38.230]  I just think that's such a wild poster that they're using the
[38:39.070 --> 38:41.650]  Columbo reading to the kid as the movie poster.
[38:43.090 --> 38:45.430]  So, what do you guys think? Princess Bride or Irishman?
[38:45.690 --> 38:46.690]  I think Princess Bride.
[38:46.690 --> 38:52.470]  If it's not, I'm going to watch the Irishman tonight to evaluate this.
[38:52.710 --> 38:57.250]  Okay, well, 7.8 is what we're trying to beat here.
[38:57.850 --> 39:01.450]  Princess Bride, 8 on the nose.
[39:02.490 --> 39:03.170]  It's a high score.
[39:03.730 --> 39:06.670]  The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977.
[39:07.210 --> 39:09.310]  Gavin, do you think that movie's higher than an 8 on IMDB?
[39:10.110 --> 39:10.970]  I mean, it's a classic.
[39:12.430 --> 39:14.390]  It's not Moore's Worst.
[39:15.210 --> 39:16.950]  I don't know how to measure that.
[39:17.130 --> 39:17.910]  Glowing indoors.
[39:19.990 --> 39:21.490]  I mean, he had some stink pots.
[39:21.970 --> 39:23.150]  This is going to be all on you, Gavin.
[39:23.510 --> 39:24.190]  It is a cool poster.
[39:24.690 --> 39:27.690]  I mean, I don't think... does any Bond have an 8?
[39:28.590 --> 39:29.230]  Skyfall, probably.
[39:29.430 --> 39:30.270]  Maybe Casino Royale.
[39:30.630 --> 39:31.190]  Yeah, maybe Casino Royale.
[39:31.250 --> 39:33.230]  This one certainly doesn't have an 8, I'll tell you that.
[39:33.370 --> 39:34.390]  Okay, okay, okay.
[39:34.970 --> 39:39.470]  So, we're trusting Gavin's gut and going Princess Bride.
[39:39.550 --> 39:40.090]  Geoff, you good with that?
[39:40.130 --> 39:41.230]  Yeah, I'm great with it.
[39:41.230 --> 39:42.590]  Princess Bride with the 8.
[39:43.070 --> 39:46.290]  Spy Who Loved Me with the 7 on the nose.
[39:47.070 --> 39:48.490]  So, 7 is what we're up against.
[39:49.030 --> 39:49.810]  Oh, fuck.
[39:50.250 --> 39:51.130]  Everywhere, all at once.
[39:51.170 --> 39:52.270]  I feel like this is easy.
[39:52.370 --> 39:52.910]  It's everything everywhere at once.
[39:53.870 --> 39:54.270]  Absolutely.
[39:54.870 --> 39:56.510]  Recency, Bias, Alone, that movie, yeah.
[39:56.950 --> 39:57.930]  Everybody loves that movie.
[39:58.250 --> 39:58.810]  It's got everything.
[39:58.950 --> 39:59.730]  It's got Jamie Lee Curtis.
[39:59.850 --> 40:00.650]  It has the raccoon.
[40:00.850 --> 40:02.090]  It's got the weird fingers.
[40:02.250 --> 40:04.050]  It's got it all here.
[40:04.070 --> 40:05.850]  It's got like apples smashing together, really.
[40:06.330 --> 40:07.150]  It's just amazing.
[40:10.210 --> 40:15.130]  That's actually, I actually, I actually hate that part and I fast forward it when I see that, so.
[40:15.230 --> 40:16.990]  You fast forwarded through those 14 frames?
[40:17.550 --> 40:17.790]  Uh-huh.
[40:18.270 --> 40:19.550]  Yeah, I need to get through them faster.
[40:19.610 --> 40:20.510]  I'm doing fast-mo, guys.
[40:24.910 --> 40:29.510]  Well, we're going with everything, everywhere, all at once to beat the 7, The Spy Who Loved Me.
[40:30.730 --> 40:31.530]  7.8.
[40:33.170 --> 40:33.970]  7.8.
[40:34.930 --> 40:37.110]  Against 1917 from 2019.
[40:38.090 --> 40:38.570]  Thoughts?
[40:39.230 --> 40:40.910]  I didn't see it.
[40:40.970 --> 40:41.350]  It was all right.
[40:41.450 --> 40:43.410]  I think people really like 1917, though.
[40:43.730 --> 40:45.050]  That's the one with Harry Styles in it?
[40:45.510 --> 40:46.610]  No, that's Dunkirk.
[40:47.010 --> 40:47.570]  Oh, okay.
[40:48.050 --> 40:50.850]  1917 is the one-shot one, right?
[40:50.930 --> 40:52.030]  Yeah, it's the one-shot.
[40:52.490 --> 40:53.710]  In quotes, one-shot.
[40:54.330 --> 40:55.510]  Hard to beat 7.8.
[40:55.950 --> 40:56.430]  Yeah.
[40:56.950 --> 40:59.530]  Yeah, but it was, I mean, it's war, though.
[40:59.650 --> 41:02.430]  I feel like the war ones always score pretty high.
[41:02.830 --> 41:08.550]  And it's tough to, like, have to evaluate how culturally everywhere, everything,
[41:08.770 --> 41:09.750]  everywhere all at once was.
[41:10.050 --> 41:14.010]  Like, I felt like I heard about that movie non-stop, but that doesn't necessarily mean
[41:14.010 --> 41:15.110]  it's a higher IMDb.
[41:15.550 --> 41:20.790]  I just think because it's such a crazy-looking movie, less people would have seen it.
[41:21.110 --> 41:25.630]  Yeah, I guess it becomes a weird thing, though, too, of, like, people have to search these
[41:25.630 --> 41:27.510]  movies, right, to put in a ranking.
[41:27.890 --> 41:31.470]  Yeah, also, you have to think, too, like, you say less people will have seen it, but the
[41:31.470 --> 41:35.870]  people that did see it probably would be more inclined to like it because of the visuals.
[41:37.110 --> 41:38.310]  So, I don't know.
[41:39.470 --> 41:42.830]  Are people voting on IMDb tricked by a fake one-shot?
[41:43.770 --> 41:44.170]  Yeah.
[41:44.670 --> 41:44.950]  Yeah.
[41:45.170 --> 41:45.550]  Probably.
[41:46.610 --> 41:49.250]  I think still everything everywhere all at once probably has a higher rating.
[41:49.750 --> 41:51.330]  7.8 is a tough number to beat.
[41:51.610 --> 41:58.790]  When I think about it comparatively, though, I feel like the Patriot being 7.6, 1917 has
[41:58.790 --> 42:04.210]  to be more than .4 or yeah, more than .4 at least.
[42:04.650 --> 42:05.450]  I think it's an 8.
[42:05.770 --> 42:06.330]  Could be an 8.
[42:06.610 --> 42:13.350]  If the Patriot is 7.6, I feel like 1917 feels like it could be above the Patriot.
[42:13.990 --> 42:16.390]  Do people like the Patriot way more than I realize?
[42:16.810 --> 42:17.870]  I don't think so.
[42:17.990 --> 42:20.510]  I didn't know that the Patriot was like a well-liked movie.
[42:20.510 --> 42:22.590]  I don't remember it being particularly...
[42:22.590 --> 42:25.410]  I remember it coming out and, you know, being a summer movie, but I don't remember doing
[42:25.410 --> 42:26.230]  particularly well or anything.
[42:26.230 --> 42:27.350]  Mm-hmm.
[42:27.350 --> 42:28.470]  So which one are we going with, boys?
[42:28.950 --> 42:31.470]  I already said I'm going with everything everywhere all at once.
[42:31.670 --> 42:34.030]  I'm going to go 1917, so it's going to be Gavin.
[42:34.370 --> 42:35.110]  Gavin the tiebreaker.
[42:35.550 --> 42:39.450]  I just... when it comes down to this, I just think, what would my parents go for?
[42:40.030 --> 42:42.230]  Are your parents rating movies on IMDb?
[42:45.710 --> 42:47.230]  I'd go 1917.
[42:48.230 --> 42:49.650]  1917 is the pick.
[42:49.990 --> 42:52.650]  Geoff, you have something a lot over these guys if it's wrong.
[42:52.870 --> 42:54.370]  7.8, the number to beat.
[42:54.990 --> 42:55.510]  1917.
[42:56.850 --> 42:57.890]  8.2!
[42:57.890 --> 42:57.910]  8.2!
[42:58.450 --> 42:59.750]  Great job, guys.
[42:59.810 --> 42:59.970]  Incredible.
[42:59.970 --> 43:01.970]  My finger was not on the pulse there.
[43:02.030 --> 43:02.490]  Now...
[43:02.490 --> 43:04.750]  That's not a good film and it did not do well.
[43:05.290 --> 43:05.490]  What?
[43:06.550 --> 43:09.290]  Superman IV, The Quest for Peace from 1987.
[43:10.930 --> 43:13.110]  Nuclear power in the best hands.
[43:13.430 --> 43:14.130]  Yes, not above an 8.2.
[43:14.710 --> 43:17.530]  In the hands of Lex Luthor, it is pure evil.
[43:17.830 --> 43:19.650]  It's the only Superman film I've never seen.
[43:20.750 --> 43:21.670]  It's so bad.
[43:22.250 --> 43:23.630]  Oh, I haven't seen the new one, actually.
[43:23.630 --> 43:24.490]  1917.
[43:24.750 --> 43:26.890]  Yeah, I'm at 1917.
[43:27.310 --> 43:28.070]  Okay, 1917.
[43:28.450 --> 43:30.410]  Do you think this movie is above a 6?
[43:30.970 --> 43:31.270]  No.
[43:32.170 --> 43:33.570]  No, I'll agree with that.
[43:34.230 --> 43:34.750]  3.7!
[43:34.750 --> 43:35.370]  3.7!
[43:35.750 --> 43:37.650]  That is so bad.
[43:38.230 --> 43:42.550]  Oh, Superman IV, The Quest for Peace versus Justice League 2017.
[43:42.990 --> 43:43.930]  I think Justice League.
[43:43.930 --> 43:45.050]  3.7.
[43:45.250 --> 43:46.890]  3.7 is pretty fucking low.
[43:47.030 --> 43:48.590]  It's... that is absurdly low.
[43:48.930 --> 43:51.450]  I don't think Justice League was that low, although...
[43:52.310 --> 43:53.130]  No, it's not that low.
[43:53.130 --> 43:54.110]  I'm not going to overthink it.
[43:54.230 --> 43:56.090]  I bet it's like a 4.8 or something.
[43:56.530 --> 43:57.210]  That sounds right.
[43:57.970 --> 44:01.230]  Yeah, I was going to say, do you think Justice League, which I assume you guys are picking,
[44:01.410 --> 44:02.650]  do you think it cracks a 5?
[44:03.050 --> 44:03.270]  No.
[44:03.470 --> 44:07.150]  I think 4.8 to 5.2 is the range I would put it in.
[44:07.450 --> 44:09.550]  And we're talking the Joss Whedon one.
[44:10.230 --> 44:11.870]  Uh, yeah, I guess we are.
[44:12.230 --> 44:15.370]  I can't tell from this, but 2017, I would think so.
[44:15.390 --> 44:17.790]  It has color, so I think it is the...
[44:18.210 --> 44:18.530]  Yeah.
[44:19.150 --> 44:20.850]  Okay, we locking it in?
[44:21.370 --> 44:21.610]  Yeah.
[44:22.090 --> 44:23.510]  Justice League 2017, 6.
[44:23.510 --> 44:23.850]  Yes.
[44:24.150 --> 44:24.430]  Wow.
[44:24.690 --> 44:25.250]  There you go.
[44:25.710 --> 44:26.150]  There you go.
[44:26.930 --> 44:27.250]  Rush.
[44:27.310 --> 44:28.070]  Oh, people love Rush.
[44:28.950 --> 44:29.990]  People love Rush.
[44:30.010 --> 44:31.330]  People love Rush.
[44:31.510 --> 44:32.110]  People love Rush.
[44:32.710 --> 44:34.210]  What's got to do better than 6?
[44:34.590 --> 44:36.650]  You know people, they love Rush.
[44:36.830 --> 44:37.330]  They do.
[44:37.930 --> 44:43.130]  It is like the definitive Ron Howard movie, I feel like, in the sense of like nobody really
[44:43.130 --> 44:44.310]  cares or has seen it.
[44:44.610 --> 44:47.590]  Like it doesn't shake anything, but the people that do go, oh, it was pretty good.
[44:48.170 --> 44:49.410]  Yeah, you just did...
[44:49.410 --> 44:50.790]  That is every Ron Howard film.
[44:51.910 --> 44:55.390]  Uh, Rush, you think it beats the 6 of Justice League?
[44:55.490 --> 44:56.110]  That's what we're going with?
[44:56.430 --> 44:57.350]  I do, yeah.
[44:57.810 --> 44:58.090]  Okay.
[44:58.250 --> 44:58.950]  I think people really like that.
[44:58.950 --> 45:01.750]  Rush 2013, 8.1.
[45:01.950 --> 45:02.570]  People love Rush.
[45:02.590 --> 45:04.250]  8 is a high score.
[45:05.670 --> 45:07.830]  Now You See Me 2 from 2016.
[45:08.250 --> 45:13.490]  The people that don't vote on IMDB ratings love Now You See Me 2, but this is IMDB ratings,
[45:13.610 --> 45:14.290]  so it's Rush.
[45:15.030 --> 45:15.290]  Yeah.
[45:15.590 --> 45:17.190]  Gavin, any thoughts on Now You See Me 2?
[45:17.710 --> 45:21.150]  Now, if they would have brought back Isla Fisher, sorry to cut you off, Gavin, but I
[45:21.150 --> 45:27.230]  I mean, Now You See Me 2 probably doesn't have Clint Howard in it.
[45:27.290 --> 45:28.090]  That's true.
[45:29.230 --> 45:33.290]  If we're talking box office, Now You See Me 2 definitely winning the China factor.
[45:33.890 --> 45:34.350]  Right.
[45:34.810 --> 45:35.550]  Easy China factor win.
[45:36.130 --> 45:40.130]  8.1 of Rush, Now You See Me 2, 6.4.
[45:40.270 --> 45:40.790]  That feels right.
[45:41.150 --> 45:44.690]  Then Now You See Me 2, 6.4 against The Island from 2005.
[45:45.250 --> 45:45.970]  Oh, fuck.
[45:46.170 --> 45:47.530]  People didn't like The Island.
[45:47.850 --> 45:48.870]  Is that the Michael Bay movie?
[45:49.210 --> 45:49.470]  Yeah.
[45:49.550 --> 45:49.910]  Yeah.
[45:49.910 --> 45:52.770]  Where he used the same footage in Transformers.
[45:53.110 --> 45:57.150]  Yeah, it's more like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson find out they're clones
[45:57.150 --> 45:58.890]  and they escape the clone facility.
[45:59.350 --> 45:59.510]  Yeah.
[45:59.890 --> 46:00.870]  I'd go Now You See Me 2.
[46:01.290 --> 46:02.210]  6.4.
[46:02.770 --> 46:05.450]  You think The Island is lower than 6.4?
[46:06.130 --> 46:06.770]  I do.
[46:07.350 --> 46:07.770]  Yeah.
[46:08.230 --> 46:08.710]  Really?
[46:09.270 --> 46:13.490]  I hate the A in that poster for The Island.
[46:13.930 --> 46:14.510]  Like a mountain?
[46:14.990 --> 46:16.450]  It just bothers me.
[46:16.910 --> 46:19.750]  Well, are we picking Now You See Me 2?
[46:19.750 --> 46:22.390]  Because the movie's not about mountains.
[46:23.210 --> 46:24.670]  Mountains have nothing to do with it.
[46:24.850 --> 46:27.710]  And all the other letters don't have like a funny font thing.
[46:28.110 --> 46:30.450]  It's only the A. It's very bothersome.
[46:30.890 --> 46:31.790]  Get it out of my face.
[46:32.310 --> 46:33.170]  It's Now You See Me 2.
[46:33.650 --> 46:35.350]  I think I've heard of the other one more.
[46:36.270 --> 46:37.250]  What does that mean?
[46:38.690 --> 46:40.090]  I think it sounds like he's picking The Island.
[46:41.030 --> 46:44.270]  I just feel like The Island is like a Michael Bay movie.
[46:45.030 --> 46:49.050]  Once again, in the context of what we're rating, what does that mean?
[46:50.530 --> 46:55.090]  I think potentially more stupid people would have seen The Island and liked it.
[46:55.330 --> 46:58.390]  But the stupid people have to make the IMDB account to vote.
[46:58.750 --> 47:01.510]  Yeah, but a sequel? You think a sequel's higher?
[47:01.830 --> 47:03.510]  I think 6.4 is higher.
[47:03.970 --> 47:04.310]  Okay.
[47:04.730 --> 47:08.930]  I think I would struggle more with this if there wasn't a number on Now You See Me 2.
[47:09.250 --> 47:12.290]  Yeah, The Island 2 would definitely be lower, but it's neck and neck here.
[47:13.130 --> 47:14.030]  Geoff, what do you think?
[47:14.850 --> 47:15.350]  Ah, fuck.
[47:16.050 --> 47:17.370]  I think it's going to be close.
[47:18.350 --> 47:23.150]  6.4 is going to be hard to beat for what that movie is.
[47:23.350 --> 47:24.430]  So you're the deciding vote?
[47:24.770 --> 47:25.750]  I think I'm going to go...
[47:29.570 --> 47:31.190]  He doesn't want to be the deciding vote.
[47:31.210 --> 47:35.630]  I don't want to. I've avoided being the deciding vote every time until this moment.
[47:36.830 --> 47:39.510]  I'm going to go with Now You See Me 2.
[47:39.990 --> 47:43.250]  Now You See Me 2, 6.4, The Island from 2005.
[47:44.350 --> 47:45.230]  6.8!
[47:45.750 --> 47:47.830]  We're out at 12, boys.
[47:47.910 --> 47:48.650]  12 is not bad.
[47:49.310 --> 47:55.310]  12 is not bad. And that's an IMDB rating. That's a subjective thing. That's a tough go.
[47:55.670 --> 47:55.830]  Yeah.
[47:55.910 --> 47:56.750]  That's a real tough go.
[47:57.010 --> 47:59.570]  You have to get into the mind of the people that are doing the rating.
[48:00.410 --> 48:02.050]  Yeah, and that sucks. You don't want to be there.
[48:02.150 --> 48:03.450]  6.7? What?
[48:05.110 --> 48:05.470]  What?
[48:05.710 --> 48:06.830]  I've got to watch The Patriot.
[48:07.870 --> 48:10.310]  It's better than The Island and Now You See Me 2.
[48:10.490 --> 48:10.670]  Yeah.
[48:10.910 --> 48:13.830]  There you have it. Well, guys, this has been Regulation Over Under.
[48:13.830 --> 48:15.150]  Thank you so much for playing.
[48:15.350 --> 48:19.950]  Check out MrBeast, but you can also check out patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[48:20.270 --> 48:23.790]  You check out our YouTube channel with our podcast, also our gameplay videos.
[48:24.410 --> 48:25.870]  Check out the first episode of this show.
[48:26.370 --> 48:28.030]  Who would have thought that we would have done two?
[48:28.230 --> 48:28.770]  But here we are.
[48:28.950 --> 48:30.550]  I love it. I have so much fun doing this.
[48:31.110 --> 48:34.010]  Andrew, Gavin, Geoff, thank you so much for playing along.
[48:34.130 --> 48:35.390]  How do you guys feel about your scores?
[48:35.770 --> 48:36.970]  I think we came back in the end.
[48:37.110 --> 48:38.670]  I'm really happy with how we finished this.
[48:38.750 --> 48:41.430]  12 is a great number. We have a new bar to pass next time.
[48:41.430 --> 48:47.770]  I think I leaned heavily on the much younger and more in-tuned society, Andrew and Gavin.
[48:48.330 --> 48:51.430]  I think they are responsible for the majority of our success.
[48:51.790 --> 48:54.330]  I will say every time there was a split, Gavin was right.
[48:54.410 --> 48:56.730]  I think we got to lean even heavier on Gavin next time.
[48:56.990 --> 48:58.910]  Wow. Oh, interesting. We're learning.
[48:59.350 --> 49:00.870]  Well, I was wrong about Transformers.
[49:01.290 --> 49:03.930]  Okay. Well, we're all wrong, though, I guess, about that.
[49:04.030 --> 49:05.330]  I don't know. I'm giving you credit.
[49:05.590 --> 49:06.330]  Take the credit.
[49:06.770 --> 49:07.110]  There you go.
[49:07.270 --> 49:09.890]  Well, guys, thanks for listening and we will see you next time.
[49:09.890 --> 49:10.450]  Bye.
[49:10.470 --> 49:10.890]  Bye.
[49:11.150 --> 49:11.290]  Bye.
