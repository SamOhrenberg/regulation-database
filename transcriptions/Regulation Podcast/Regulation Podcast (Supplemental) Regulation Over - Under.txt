[00:00.000 --> 00:05.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a new game that I thought about while I was mowing my yard.
[00:05.360 --> 00:07.680]  It's called Regulation Over Under.
[00:08.140 --> 00:12.620]  And we're using a website called MoreOrLess to find these different games.
[00:12.760 --> 00:14.460]  This is something that we're going to give a shot at.
[00:14.560 --> 00:18.000]  A brand new, half-thought-out game where we're just going to play some over-under,
[00:18.120 --> 00:21.080]  see how the longest streak we can get is as a team.
[00:21.480 --> 00:23.120]  Maybe we take some cracks at it individually.
[00:23.420 --> 00:28.360]  But the thing that got me thinking was like, we have the summer movie stuff coming out, man.
[00:28.360 --> 00:37.000]  We really have to hone in on movie money, the power of film internationally,
[00:37.640 --> 00:41.880]  and whether these movies are going to be shown internationally or not.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.700]  But this is worldwide gross of movies.
[00:45.120 --> 00:47.420]  How much they earned with... hang on.
[00:47.500 --> 00:49.420]  How much they earned with this movie?
[00:49.880 --> 00:50.940]  Proof your knowledge here.
[00:51.020 --> 00:52.080]  Are you guys ready to proof your knowledge?
[00:52.260 --> 00:54.300]  I am so ready to proof it.
[00:54.540 --> 00:55.680]  Can I just say in advance?
[00:55.680 --> 00:59.460]  I'm going to be very confidently wrong about a lot of stuff in this video.
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.580]  That to me is really exciting.
[01:01.880 --> 01:05.060]  That to me is very, very exciting because I think it's really going to
[01:05.060 --> 01:08.740]  sort of shade what we're about to get into with the summer movie draft again.
[01:09.040 --> 01:12.640]  Now, our first one... and over-under is a pretty easy concept.
[01:12.760 --> 01:15.500]  It's going to give us a number and we're going to say,
[01:15.580 --> 01:18.440]  did it make more or less, essentially, than what number is given.
[01:18.760 --> 01:21.940]  Man of Steel, 2013, which is... who made that?
[01:22.440 --> 01:22.960]  Zack Snyder.
[01:22.960 --> 01:24.340]  Zack Snyder movie.
[01:26.580 --> 01:29.020]  $668 million worldwide gross.
[01:30.640 --> 01:31.520]  Twilight, 2008.
[01:31.780 --> 01:33.300]  What do you think? More or less?
[01:33.740 --> 01:37.200]  I think the true question for all of these is, which movie did better in China?
[01:37.560 --> 01:38.760]  That's what I was about to say.
[01:39.140 --> 01:40.060]  China, big market.
[01:40.540 --> 01:41.420]  China loves baseball.
[01:41.840 --> 01:43.040]  Twilight has a baseball scene.
[01:43.380 --> 01:44.480]  Man of Steel, no baseball.
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.280]  No baseball.
[01:45.840 --> 01:46.760]  So that's a thing to consider.
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.500]  I don't think the first Twilight movie has the baseball scene, does it?
[01:49.620 --> 01:50.160]  Yes, it does.
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.600]  Is that the one it's in?
[01:52.600 --> 01:56.040]  They blow their load in the first one with the baseball scene?
[01:56.240 --> 01:57.760]  Oh, and they never go back to it.
[01:57.860 --> 01:58.760]  It's such a shame.
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.040]  Four following movies, no baseball.
[02:01.500 --> 02:03.000]  Isn't it set to that Muse song?
[02:03.500 --> 02:03.880]  It is.
[02:04.040 --> 02:04.240]  Yeah.
[02:04.620 --> 02:05.880]  That's awesome.
[02:06.340 --> 02:10.160]  Do you think Superman could hit a baseball from one continent to another?
[02:10.680 --> 02:11.160]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11.460 --> 02:12.480]  Without trying.
[02:13.320 --> 02:15.080]  I think he could hit it to another planet.
[02:15.480 --> 02:19.200]  But much like the Twilight Vampires, he can only play during thunderstorms,
[02:19.200 --> 02:21.140]  so it covers up how hard he's hitting the ball.
[02:21.360 --> 02:22.060]  It's true.
[02:22.060 --> 02:22.820]  It's true.
[02:22.900 --> 02:26.300]  And he wears an old-timey baseball hat and he does a big leg kick.
[02:26.820 --> 02:30.640]  You know what's nuts about Superman movies is there's still rockets and stuff.
[02:30.820 --> 02:32.500]  There's still people building rockets to the moon.
[02:32.800 --> 02:36.860]  Just hire Superman to pick up the rocket and put it on the moon.
[02:37.540 --> 02:41.100]  I thought you were going to say pick up the astronaut and just fly them to the moon.
[02:41.200 --> 02:41.920]  Just get them over there.
[02:43.200 --> 02:45.320]  Okay, so what do you think?
[02:45.380 --> 02:46.320]  Twilight, more or less?
[02:46.780 --> 02:50.320]  I would say less, but I'm trained that these are all going to be gotchas.
[02:50.320 --> 02:53.520]  So it's like it's fighting my brain going,
[02:53.620 --> 02:57.700]  well, no, I mean, obviously it has to be more because why else would they put this here?
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.340]  Yeah, I would have thought more.
[02:59.540 --> 03:00.520]  I would go less.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.620]  I'd go more.
[03:02.140 --> 03:02.700]  Wow, really?
[03:02.900 --> 03:03.440]  I think so.
[03:03.540 --> 03:03.720]  Okay.
[03:04.020 --> 03:05.220]  Well, Twilight was huge.
[03:05.700 --> 03:08.680]  If it was only huge in America, it's an American story.
[03:09.140 --> 03:09.460]  Yeah.
[03:09.980 --> 03:12.220]  But superheroes at the... like, you gotta...
[03:12.220 --> 03:14.540]  Man of Steel came out during a time of, like, peak Marvel.
[03:15.180 --> 03:17.240]  People are excited about superhero films.
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.440]  There's a feeling of importance.
[03:19.440 --> 03:20.300]  Michael Shannon.
[03:21.620 --> 03:22.460]  Come on.
[03:22.880 --> 03:24.320]  Everybody loves Michael Shannon.
[03:24.600 --> 03:26.080]  He gets his neck snapped.
[03:26.780 --> 03:27.400]  Well, spoilers.
[03:27.600 --> 03:28.280]  Jesus Christ.
[03:28.680 --> 03:29.060]  Oh, sorry.
[03:29.180 --> 03:30.100]  Maybe Superman then.
[03:30.700 --> 03:33.100]  Is that man... is Man of Steel the one where he does that?
[03:33.380 --> 03:33.600]  Yes.
[03:33.940 --> 03:35.060]  That Michael Shannon's in?
[03:35.220 --> 03:35.440]  Oh, yeah.
[03:35.460 --> 03:36.360]  What was the one before that?
[03:36.500 --> 03:37.180]  It wasn't.
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.220]  That was the first one.
[03:38.560 --> 03:40.980]  Superman Returns, I guess, would be the one before that.
[03:41.180 --> 03:41.740]  Oh, wow.
[03:41.900 --> 03:42.160]  Okay.
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.580]  So are we saying Twilight less than or more?
[03:44.840 --> 03:45.100]  Less.
[03:45.920 --> 03:46.060]  More?
[03:46.960 --> 03:47.380]  Boy.
[03:48.640 --> 03:49.220]  This is hard.
[03:49.220 --> 03:49.800]  I love this.
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.680]  This is the first one.
[03:50.820 --> 03:51.900]  This is the first one.
[03:52.220 --> 03:53.460]  My gut instinct is less.
[03:53.860 --> 03:54.100]  All right.
[03:54.120 --> 03:55.080]  I'll go with Andrew's gut.
[03:55.360 --> 03:55.680]  Okay.
[03:55.980 --> 03:56.300]  All right.
[03:56.360 --> 03:56.860]  Here we go.
[03:57.360 --> 03:57.760]  Twilight.
[03:58.640 --> 03:59.080]  Oh!
[03:59.280 --> 04:00.760]  Twilight got $408 million.
[04:01.000 --> 04:02.800]  So our streak right now is one.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.260]  We're doing great.
[04:04.560 --> 04:13.100]  But worldwide gross of Twilight 2008, $408 million versus Cats from 2019.
[04:13.680 --> 04:14.580]  It's got to be less.
[04:14.700 --> 04:15.280]  It's got to be less.
[04:15.280 --> 04:15.820]  It has to be.
[04:15.820 --> 04:18.660]  Everybody thought it was going to be shit from the beginning.
[04:19.220 --> 04:19.800]  Got to be less.
[04:20.080 --> 04:20.860]  They patched it.
[04:21.140 --> 04:22.980]  It could have been like an international hit.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.820]  People may have seen it.
[04:24.960 --> 04:27.860]  But the US side, I feel like, would be so low.
[04:28.180 --> 04:29.140]  They patched the buttholes.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.720]  Yeah, they patched the buttholes.
[04:31.120 --> 04:31.220]  Yeah.
[04:31.380 --> 04:31.880]  Let's go.
[04:31.960 --> 04:32.760]  Let's go less.
[04:32.980 --> 04:33.600]  Let's do less.
[04:33.780 --> 04:34.260]  Let's go less.
[04:34.320 --> 04:34.860]  Yeah, I don't think it's...
[04:34.860 --> 04:35.460]  Go less.
[04:36.500 --> 04:37.680]  Oh, way less.
[04:39.420 --> 04:40.200]  $73 million.
[04:40.300 --> 04:41.100]  Oh, wow, dude.
[04:41.540 --> 04:42.880]  Now, this one might be pretty easy.
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.940]  But this puts us in an interesting spot because Cats 2019, it's $73 million.
[04:49.220 --> 04:54.200]  Or Rogue One, a Star Wars story, didn't realize that was its whole title, from 2016.
[04:54.960 --> 04:55.920]  Definitely more.
[04:56.200 --> 04:56.660]  Way more.
[04:56.840 --> 04:59.360]  It has the best scene of all of the Star Wars.
[04:59.720 --> 04:59.900]  Yes.
[04:59.900 --> 05:02.620]  Which I didn't get was the best scene of the Star Wars.
[05:02.620 --> 05:03.980]  You're referring to the Vader thing?
[05:04.460 --> 05:04.700]  Yeah.
[05:04.980 --> 05:07.540]  Yeah, the Vader is velociraptor scene.
[05:07.880 --> 05:08.900]  I didn't watch the original.
[05:09.100 --> 05:09.740]  This was...
[05:09.740 --> 05:11.320]  I haven't seen the original movies.
[05:11.560 --> 05:14.220]  I've only seen Rogue One and the prequels.
[05:14.860 --> 05:18.440]  And so when Vader did that, I just assume that's what Vader did
[05:18.440 --> 05:21.100]  in all the movies from the reputation of Vader.
[05:21.340 --> 05:21.800]  Oh, my God.
[05:21.800 --> 05:25.800]  So, like, the significance of, like, how cool that was completely missed.
[05:25.940 --> 05:27.120]  I mean, I'm just like, this is what he does.
[05:27.240 --> 05:32.520]  Yeah, at some movies, Vader, he, like, lumbers around and he gets told off in a conference room
[05:32.520 --> 05:34.400]  and then, like, chokes someone a little bit.
[05:34.880 --> 05:36.360]  He chokes someone mentally.
[05:36.720 --> 05:39.040]  And before that, he lifts a dude up by the lapels.
[05:39.180 --> 05:39.780]  And that's it.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.960]  Well, then I feel like his rep really wasn't earned going into Rogue One.
[05:43.380 --> 05:48.260]  Well, no, he was just, like, he's a tough, badass, like, scary guy.
[05:48.260 --> 05:50.720]  And it didn't have to be seen in that way.
[05:50.800 --> 05:55.320]  That's why the... that's why that moment was so cool, because we finally got to see it that way.
[05:55.440 --> 05:58.520]  Also, you only seeing this in the prequels is saying, like,
[05:58.540 --> 06:00.640]  I've only seen Solo in the cartoon.
[06:00.920 --> 06:02.640]  Like, you're... that's insane.
[06:03.180 --> 06:04.920]  I've seen the Christmas special as well.
[06:05.240 --> 06:06.040]  Okay, all right.
[06:06.240 --> 06:08.460]  All right, so Rogue One is more.
[06:09.080 --> 06:10.380]  Will it be 10 times more?
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.740]  Oh, my God.
[06:11.740 --> 06:12.120]  Significantly.
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.140]  A billion dollars.
[06:14.980 --> 06:17.960]  Less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less.
[06:17.960 --> 06:24.100]  Rogue One, a Star Wars story, one billion dollars versus the Invisible Man from 2020
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.640]  starring Elizabeth Moss, I think.
[06:26.860 --> 06:28.600]  Also the year of COVID, by the way.
[06:28.900 --> 06:30.140]  It reviewed very well.
[06:30.240 --> 06:30.800]  Haven't seen it.
[06:31.160 --> 06:32.740]  Okay, Gavin, what do you think?
[06:32.780 --> 06:33.280]  More or less?
[06:33.560 --> 06:34.320]  Definitely less.
[06:34.780 --> 06:35.040]  Okay.
[06:36.580 --> 06:37.620]  Oh, 122.
[06:37.820 --> 06:38.140]  Okay.
[06:38.660 --> 06:39.940]  Kids movies more.
[06:40.200 --> 06:41.640]  Yeah, it's gotta be.
[06:41.780 --> 06:43.020]  It's gotta be more.
[06:43.200 --> 06:47.040]  And what we're talking about, Invisible Man 2020 versus Monsters University
[06:47.600 --> 06:47.960]  2013.
[06:48.260 --> 06:48.860]  Didn't like it.
[06:48.920 --> 06:54.840]  We're saying Monsters University is more than 122 million and...
[06:54.840 --> 06:56.360]  It's opening weekend is way more.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.320]  It's way more.
[06:57.760 --> 06:57.840]  Yeah.
[06:58.100 --> 06:59.080]  Holy shit.
[07:00.700 --> 07:02.100]  743 million dollars.
[07:03.420 --> 07:04.140]  So now...
[07:04.140 --> 07:05.960]  This was the Oscar winner, wasn't it?
[07:06.120 --> 07:06.380]  Well, yeah.
[07:06.520 --> 07:07.540]  Or it wasn't?
[07:07.560 --> 07:09.000]  It was either that or La La Land, right?
[07:09.180 --> 07:09.740]  Oh, that was it.
[07:09.780 --> 07:09.960]  Yeah.
[07:10.240 --> 07:11.360]  It was one of the two.
[07:12.000 --> 07:18.780]  I would love for a movie to be the gay black movie that is incredible and like so heartfelt.
[07:18.920 --> 07:22.080]  I would love for that to make more than Monsters University.
[07:22.360 --> 07:23.000]  There's no way.
[07:23.320 --> 07:25.960]  I feel like this is based on you not knowing what Moonlight is.
[07:26.540 --> 07:26.800]  Yeah.
[07:28.800 --> 07:31.520]  I saw Moonlight in theaters with two other people.
[07:31.620 --> 07:32.740]  I'm gonna say less.
[07:33.200 --> 07:33.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:34.280 --> 07:40.200]  I like that you're trying to like meta the game when truly it looks like it's just a random pull.
[07:40.200 --> 07:42.260]  Okay, Moonlight, less.
[07:42.520 --> 07:43.860]  It's gonna be so much less.
[07:44.020 --> 07:44.280]  Oh, wow.
[07:44.340 --> 07:45.060]  Good for Moonlight.
[07:45.460 --> 07:46.160]  65 million.
[07:46.520 --> 07:48.360]  That's more than I would have thought Moonlight would have done.
[07:48.520 --> 07:48.980]  That's great.
[07:50.140 --> 07:50.540]  Now...
[07:50.540 --> 07:51.980]  Saw 4.
[07:53.100 --> 07:56.040]  Moonlight was 65 million or Saw 4.
[07:56.260 --> 07:57.260]  See, now here's where...
[07:57.260 --> 08:00.020]  Now it's like it has to be more, doesn't it?
[08:00.060 --> 08:03.840]  It has to be more because the third one was the best one in a lot of people's eyes.
[08:04.140 --> 08:06.540]  I think it's only going to be like 120 million.
[08:06.740 --> 08:09.140]  I don't think it's going to be like 700 million, right?
[08:09.660 --> 08:09.980]  No.
[08:10.200 --> 08:12.420]  No, because these movies are so cheap.
[08:12.840 --> 08:13.020]  Yeah.
[08:13.380 --> 08:14.100]  Okay, let's see.
[08:14.980 --> 08:16.520]  Worldwide gross for Saw 4.
[08:16.760 --> 08:17.480]  We're saying more.
[08:19.020 --> 08:19.420]  Yeah.
[08:20.320 --> 08:21.040]  139 million.
[08:21.500 --> 08:21.800]  Oh.
[08:23.540 --> 08:24.900]  Toy Story, less.
[08:26.200 --> 08:27.380]  No, more, more, more, more, more.
[08:27.440 --> 08:28.280]  No, no, no, no, no, more.
[08:28.440 --> 08:29.660]  Why did you say less?
[08:29.820 --> 08:33.560]  My brain reversed it and I was thinking, oh, well, Saw is less than Toy Story.
[08:33.660 --> 08:33.960]  It's more.
[08:33.960 --> 08:38.780]  I was like taking in a big deep breath to kick off and then you said, oh, no, more.
[08:38.780 --> 08:39.280]  Yeah, no.
[08:39.500 --> 08:39.780]  Uh-huh.
[08:39.780 --> 08:40.400]  Uh-huh.
[08:40.800 --> 08:42.360]  Okay, definitely more.
[08:42.460 --> 08:46.020]  I bet you the song just made more than Saw 3.
[08:48.340 --> 08:51.880]  Okay, so now we have, we are given a tough choice.
[08:52.380 --> 08:54.640]  Well, now I have inflation questions.
[08:54.760 --> 08:55.780]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[08:55.940 --> 08:57.060]  Are we adjusted or what?
[08:57.300 --> 09:01.880]  I don't think so, but I do think that we're going to find out when we do this Pinocchio one.
[09:02.060 --> 09:06.140]  Because Toy Story is at 404 million and Pinocchio, which came out in 1940,
[09:06.140 --> 09:12.240]  I don't know that there was 404 million dollars in the world, so I assume it's less.
[09:12.460 --> 09:16.080]  But do you think old man Disney was actually getting real totals or he's just going,
[09:16.400 --> 09:19.200]  well, there's 600 million this movie made.
[09:19.380 --> 09:20.600]  It made all the money.
[09:21.000 --> 09:21.840]  Build a park.
[09:22.400 --> 09:25.060]  I think 600 million was an unfathomable number.
[09:25.140 --> 09:27.840]  Like nobody could think of that high of a number at that time.
[09:27.880 --> 09:28.640]  So it's got to be less.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.940]  It was also in the middle of a world war.
[09:31.460 --> 09:31.680]  Yeah.
[09:31.880 --> 09:32.820]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[09:33.260 --> 09:33.860]  All right, here we go.
[09:35.120 --> 09:35.900]  121 million.
[09:35.900 --> 09:36.720]  I'm impressed.
[09:37.160 --> 09:38.240]  I'm impressed, too.
[09:38.540 --> 09:40.020]  Oh, 121 million dollars.
[09:40.120 --> 09:42.000]  That's how much it cost to defeat Hitler, too.
[09:42.260 --> 09:43.260]  That was like the whole war.
[09:43.400 --> 09:44.580]  It was the cost of Pinocchio.
[09:45.880 --> 09:46.760]  Maleficent, 2014.
[09:47.160 --> 09:48.960]  More or less than the 121.
[09:49.380 --> 09:50.080]  I'd say more.
[09:50.580 --> 09:51.260]  More, right?
[09:51.580 --> 09:52.260]  I would say more.
[09:52.660 --> 09:54.580]  It did well enough for them to make a sequel.
[09:55.000 --> 10:00.400]  And I feel like all these movies in like the 2010s, like a baseline success is like 50,
[10:00.480 --> 10:00.960]  60 mil.
[10:01.360 --> 10:02.200]  That'd be a disappointment.
[10:02.200 --> 10:04.460]  So, okay, here we go.
[10:04.560 --> 10:05.660]  Maleficent, we're saying more.
[10:05.920 --> 10:06.920]  Oh, my God.
[10:07.000 --> 10:07.500]  Oh, my God.
[10:07.500 --> 10:09.920]  It made 758 million.
[10:10.080 --> 10:12.120]  That's the biggest surprise to me so far.
[10:12.520 --> 10:12.680]  Yeah.
[10:12.740 --> 10:14.160]  What the hell is The Call of the Wild?
[10:14.340 --> 10:20.600]  Now, Maleficent, it's 758 million or Call of the Wild 2020, a movie we've never heard of.
[10:20.720 --> 10:23.320]  Is that the dog and Harrison Ford movie?
[10:23.600 --> 10:23.920]  Yes.
[10:23.960 --> 10:24.280]  Okay.
[10:24.400 --> 10:24.660]  Yeah.
[10:24.880 --> 10:27.400]  Oh, do you think that made more than 758 million?
[10:27.500 --> 10:28.460]  Not a chance in hell.
[10:29.160 --> 10:29.400]  No?
[10:29.900 --> 10:30.620]  Definitely not.
[10:30.920 --> 10:32.060]  Okay, I'm going to go less.
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.320]  That's how much 758 million is how much Harrison Ford has spent in Crash Plane.
[10:36.960 --> 10:37.300]  Okay.
[10:37.920 --> 10:39.160]  Very interesting here.
[10:39.800 --> 10:42.380]  Call of the Wild, 2020 dollars, 107 million.
[10:42.860 --> 10:47.100]  Okay, so I kind of have, oh, actually, Shawshank Redemption.
[10:47.660 --> 10:49.620]  Shawshank didn't do well in the theater, did it?
[10:49.920 --> 10:50.720]  No, it didn't.
[10:50.820 --> 10:55.840]  Yeah, I think Shawshank was retroactively much more popular than it was at the time.
[10:56.000 --> 10:56.780]  I'm saying less.
[10:57.500 --> 10:59.560]  And now it's like one of the best movies, top three.
[10:59.680 --> 11:00.320]  Because I...
[11:00.320 --> 11:00.620]  Right.
[11:00.620 --> 11:05.540]  When we did the Birth of Your Movie Ranker, I used Box Office Mojo as a thing to, like,
[11:05.580 --> 11:08.340]  see all the in-year releases to try to get a feel like what was popular.
[11:08.940 --> 11:11.660]  Shawshank Redemption was at, like, near the bottom of the list.
[11:11.800 --> 11:12.260]  I was surprised.
[11:12.700 --> 11:14.380]  So do we think less?
[11:14.540 --> 11:15.620]  I'd say less, yeah.
[11:15.880 --> 11:17.000]  Okay, Gavin?
[11:17.980 --> 11:19.120]  Gavin, what do you think?
[11:19.400 --> 11:21.160]  Like, I know it was low, but was it like...
[11:21.160 --> 11:22.440]  Oh, yeah, I think less.
[11:22.580 --> 11:23.160]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[11:23.380 --> 11:27.740]  Think about 1994, how much of a hit it would be if it was 107 million dollars.
[11:28.460 --> 11:29.220]  Okay, here we go.
[11:29.220 --> 11:30.660]  Shawshank Redemption, less.
[11:31.040 --> 11:32.080]  It's definitely less.
[11:32.140 --> 11:34.040]  Oh my god, so...
[11:34.040 --> 11:35.140]  That's the lowest yet.
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.320]  Now, 28 million dollars.
[11:37.420 --> 11:42.520]  Do you think the Sonic the Hedgehog 1 movie made more than 28 million dollars?
[11:42.860 --> 11:46.060]  I bet they spent more than 28 million dollars making the freaking hedgehog.
[11:46.520 --> 11:46.840]  Oh, yeah.
[11:46.840 --> 11:48.420]  Well, the first time or the second time?
[11:48.820 --> 11:49.760]  The second time.
[11:50.040 --> 11:51.020]  Oh, right, they patched it.
[11:51.240 --> 11:52.120]  They patched the trailer.
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.620]  28 million might have been Jim Carrey's salary.
[11:54.980 --> 11:56.460]  Yeah, dude, they patched the hog.
[11:56.560 --> 11:57.240]  And we gotta go more.
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.960]  I think he made 10 million for Dumb and Dumber in 1994.
[12:00.800 --> 12:01.160]  Crazy.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.920]  Which is when Shawshank Redemption came out.
[12:02.960 --> 12:03.560]  Isn't that incredible?
[12:04.080 --> 12:06.100]  All right, the hedgehog made more than 28 million.
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.280]  306 million.
[12:08.320 --> 12:15.760]  Oh, 306 million for Sonic the Hedgehog versus the Hobbit Desolation of Smaug 2013.
[12:16.300 --> 12:17.520]  That's the second one, right?
[12:18.060 --> 12:18.880]  Or the third one?
[12:19.180 --> 12:19.520]  Third one.
[12:19.920 --> 12:21.180]  No, the third one is the armies.
[12:21.760 --> 12:22.940]  Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right, you're right.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.260]  I think this is the middle one.
[12:25.640 --> 12:26.740]  I did not see this movie.
[12:26.740 --> 12:27.740]  I saw the first one.
[12:27.960 --> 12:28.860]  I did not see this movie.
[12:28.880 --> 12:31.180]  I saw them, but I don't remember how they did.
[12:31.760 --> 12:32.780]  Well, they made all three.
[12:33.440 --> 12:34.400]  Well, the first one did.
[12:34.620 --> 12:38.000]  I think they made... but it was like they made all of them at once, I feel like.
[12:38.620 --> 12:40.980]  Because they did this one and the next one back to back.
[12:41.400 --> 12:42.580]  Yeah, I think they were all shot together.
[12:43.060 --> 12:43.900]  I would say more.
[12:44.460 --> 12:45.360]  Yeah, I'd say more.
[12:46.100 --> 12:48.120]  Because it's not the first one, I'd be...
[12:48.120 --> 12:49.060]  A little hesitant.
[12:49.460 --> 12:50.500]  Yeah, I'd be a little bit scared.
[12:50.600 --> 12:52.000]  But yeah, it's gotta be more.
[12:52.500 --> 12:52.760]  More?
[12:52.880 --> 12:53.840]  It's a Hobbit film.
[12:54.140 --> 12:54.580]  I think more.
[12:54.580 --> 12:56.580]  Okay, 306 million.
[12:56.740 --> 12:57.940]  For Sonic the Hedgehog.
[12:58.040 --> 13:01.060]  We're at a score of 13 straight correct guesses so far.
[13:01.580 --> 13:03.800]  Will we get The Hobbit, Desolation of Smaug?
[13:04.460 --> 13:04.880]  Smaug.
[13:05.360 --> 13:05.640]  Oh, yeah.
[13:05.920 --> 13:06.820]  Holy shit.
[13:07.080 --> 13:07.560]  Killed it.
[13:07.760 --> 13:08.300]  Oh, shit.
[13:08.800 --> 13:09.640]  958 million.
[13:09.820 --> 13:09.920]  More.
[13:09.940 --> 13:10.360]  Oh, wow.
[13:10.520 --> 13:10.660]  More.
[13:10.820 --> 13:13.500]  Now, Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End.
[13:13.600 --> 13:14.260]  Which one is that?
[13:14.480 --> 13:15.040]  The last one.
[13:15.300 --> 13:15.720]  The third one.
[13:16.080 --> 13:17.340]  I thought that was like five of them.
[13:18.280 --> 13:19.680]  The third of the trilogy.
[13:19.880 --> 13:21.070]  So this is the last one with...
[13:21.660 --> 13:22.640]  Oh, I would say more.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.540]  Oh, but it's 2007.
[13:25.180 --> 13:27.200]  Wait, this is the last one with what?
[13:27.580 --> 13:30.460]  With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.
[13:30.800 --> 13:36.460]  Yeah, it was before like Johnny Depp was paying off his vineyards in the ones without anyone else.
[13:36.600 --> 13:37.540]  And then he came back, right?
[13:37.580 --> 13:41.560]  But then didn't Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley come back for the last one that they did?
[13:41.720 --> 13:43.320]  They make an appearance in the last one.
[13:43.460 --> 13:43.640]  Okay.
[13:43.980 --> 13:46.020]  So there's only one movie without them.
[13:46.240 --> 13:46.640]  Yes.
[13:46.980 --> 13:47.180]  Yeah.
[13:47.560 --> 13:49.060]  So this is the third of the trilogy.
[13:49.200 --> 13:50.020]  That's more important.
[13:50.120 --> 13:51.100]  This is the end.
[13:51.100 --> 13:55.740]  I would also classify them as showing up in a post-credits scene as not being in the movie.
[13:56.120 --> 13:57.500]  So this is the middle movie.
[13:57.760 --> 14:01.280]  I only saw Black Pearl and Dead Man's chest.
[14:01.560 --> 14:02.340]  Bill Nye or whatever else.
[14:02.380 --> 14:04.320]  Yeah, I've never seen this one.
[14:04.520 --> 14:04.800]  Was it good?
[14:04.820 --> 14:05.540]  I think these are huge.
[14:05.560 --> 14:05.960]  It's all right.
[14:06.220 --> 14:07.740]  Yeah, they get progressively worse.
[14:08.080 --> 14:08.360]  Yes.
[14:08.460 --> 14:09.420]  The first one's perfection.
[14:09.680 --> 14:10.380]  But here's the thing.
[14:10.520 --> 14:13.560]  Do you think it made a billion dollars in 2007?
[14:14.200 --> 14:14.640]  I do.
[14:15.060 --> 14:15.920]  I do think it did.
[14:16.080 --> 14:16.140]  Yeah, I do.
[14:16.140 --> 14:17.560]  Wow, between like worldwide total?
[14:17.840 --> 14:18.380]  I would say more.
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.320]  I think so.
[14:19.960 --> 14:20.300]  Damn.
[14:20.580 --> 14:21.380]  More than The Hobbit.
[14:21.820 --> 14:22.060]  Yeah.
[14:22.460 --> 14:22.740]  Yeah.
[14:23.100 --> 14:24.620]  Okay, Gavin, how do you feel about it?
[14:25.020 --> 14:25.800]  They're pretty confident.
[14:26.080 --> 14:27.760]  I'm sure, but I'm happy to go with them.
[14:28.220 --> 14:30.960]  Okay, we're gonna go with more Pirates of the Caribbean.
[14:33.100 --> 14:34.180]  Wow, barely.
[14:34.480 --> 14:37.840]  It was like 958 to 960 million.
[14:38.200 --> 14:39.280]  That's crazy.
[14:40.640 --> 14:43.780]  That was a lot of confidence for a $2 million gap.
[14:44.460 --> 14:44.640]  Yep, yep.
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.300]  But next, we have The Incredibles 2 from 2018.
[14:49.760 --> 14:50.020]  This is hard.
[14:50.020 --> 14:50.940]  Here's the thing.
[14:51.000 --> 14:51.100]  Yeah.
[14:51.200 --> 14:55.940]  Well now, I think it's sort of easier because for Incredibles 2 to pass, I feel like it's
[14:55.940 --> 14:56.440]  hitting a billion.
[14:56.560 --> 14:58.320]  I don't think Incredibles 2 made a billion dollars.
[14:58.440 --> 14:59.340]  Yeah, I'd say less.
[14:59.640 --> 14:59.920]  Really?
[15:00.020 --> 15:00.940]  You don't think it made a billion?
[15:01.860 --> 15:04.200]  I think there's such a small pool of movies.
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.740]  It's like the Dark Knight, Avatar, Titanic.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.420]  Like, I think crossing over a billion is a significant thing.
[15:10.880 --> 15:12.920]  In 2018, it wasn't as significant though, was it?
[15:13.220 --> 15:13.740]  I think so.
[15:13.740 --> 15:19.620]  I still think there's less than seven movies, I'd say, that have made over a billion dollars.
[15:20.080 --> 15:21.780]  And I could be completely wrong on that.
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.860]  I feel like any time a movie crosses a billion, it's a really big deal.
[15:26.300 --> 15:29.700]  I just feel like the Marvel movies came out and then it was like everyone's crossing a
[15:29.700 --> 15:29.920]  billion.
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.120]  That could be true.
[15:31.380 --> 15:33.460]  Like, Avengers movies crossed two billion.
[15:34.240 --> 15:34.620]  Really?
[15:34.720 --> 15:35.740]  Three billion, didn't it?
[15:36.060 --> 15:38.060]  Didn't one of them do ape shit?
[15:38.360 --> 15:39.280]  I think so.
[15:39.280 --> 15:44.060]  But is Incredibles 2, are we going to say bigger than the third Pirates of the Caribbean?
[15:44.260 --> 15:44.920]  I don't think so.
[15:45.180 --> 15:46.540]  Which was bigger in China.
[15:47.240 --> 15:48.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[15:48.440 --> 15:50.100]  And that's tough.
[15:50.420 --> 15:51.860]  Superhero stuff, big stuff.
[15:52.020 --> 15:53.020]  Animated movie, big stuff.
[15:53.120 --> 15:54.420]  Kids movie, big stuff.
[15:54.780 --> 15:59.760]  But Pirates, third in the trilogy, which I've been told is very important, which I've been
[15:59.760 --> 15:59.960]  told.
[16:00.300 --> 16:00.980]  Disney movie as well.
[16:01.840 --> 16:03.000]  Do we want to say less?
[16:03.360 --> 16:03.980]  I think it's less.
[16:04.140 --> 16:04.960]  I think it's less.
[16:05.740 --> 16:06.000]  Okay.
[16:06.140 --> 16:07.620]  Okay, here we go.
[16:07.620 --> 16:08.820]  Oh, God.
[16:09.500 --> 16:09.900]  No!
[16:10.800 --> 16:11.960]  It's so much more.
[16:12.300 --> 16:14.160]  It was so much more.
[16:14.500 --> 16:16.340]  1.2 billion.
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.020]  That must be one of the six movies this week.
[16:19.160 --> 16:19.700]  That was on me.
[16:20.040 --> 16:22.000]  I'm just, I had the burger confidence.
[16:22.160 --> 16:23.080]  I had billion confidence.
[16:25.080 --> 16:31.220]  We got, we got 15 straight and that's a silver medal, according to this game.
[16:31.340 --> 16:31.860]  That's not bad.
[16:31.980 --> 16:32.380]  That's not bad.
[16:32.660 --> 16:33.340]  Can we get gold?
[16:33.740 --> 16:36.080]  You want to take, yeah, I was gonna say, you want to take another crack at it, boys?
[16:36.120 --> 16:36.660]  Yeah, we do.
[16:36.660 --> 16:37.500]  Okay.
[16:37.780 --> 16:38.220]  Absolutely.
[16:38.580 --> 16:41.020]  Did you look up how many movies made over a billion dollars?
[16:41.120 --> 16:42.540]  I'm looking up right now.
[16:42.540 --> 16:44.180]  As of April 9th, 2025.
[16:44.180 --> 16:44.640]  You're cheating!
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.480]  57 movies have grossed over a billion.
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.280]  Now that is slightly, that's, I'm doing the math on my end.
[16:53.440 --> 16:54.960]  That's slightly more than like three.
[16:55.320 --> 16:55.840]  He said six.
[16:56.200 --> 16:56.840]  Oh, six.
[16:56.960 --> 16:58.540]  Well, six is slightly more than three also.
[16:58.760 --> 16:59.980]  So pretty neck and neck.
[17:00.280 --> 17:01.880]  You just gotta times it by like nine.
[17:02.360 --> 17:03.000]  It's pretty close.
[17:03.680 --> 17:04.120]  Yeah.
[17:05.020 --> 17:05.460]  Okay.
[17:05.660 --> 17:05.820]  Yeah.
[17:05.820 --> 17:06.980]  You want to give it another shot?
[17:07.120 --> 17:07.220]  Yeah.
[17:07.340 --> 17:07.660]  Yes.
[17:08.100 --> 17:08.740]  All right, here we go.
[17:08.920 --> 17:10.140]  Silver medal, not bad.
[17:10.260 --> 17:13.240]  If I was in the Olympics and someone said, not bad, it gave me a silver medal.
[17:16.860 --> 17:20.320]  Hey, Moonlight, 2016 at 65 million, which we've seen already.
[17:21.140 --> 17:22.560]  Frozen 2, 2019.
[17:22.780 --> 17:23.640]  Do you think it's more or less?
[17:23.940 --> 17:24.120]  Definitely more.
[17:24.780 --> 17:25.100]  More?
[17:25.360 --> 17:25.540]  Significantly more.
[17:25.540 --> 17:25.840]  You think so?
[17:25.860 --> 17:26.020]  Yep.
[17:26.160 --> 17:26.440]  All right.
[17:26.800 --> 17:27.960]  Let's see if it's one of the 57.
[17:28.280 --> 17:29.200]  It sure is!
[17:29.660 --> 17:30.260]  Oh, less.
[17:30.300 --> 17:30.700]  1.450.
[17:32.640 --> 17:33.180]  Oh, onward?
[17:33.320 --> 17:33.840]  Nope, less.
[17:33.960 --> 17:34.420]  Onward bond.
[17:34.440 --> 17:35.000]  Never heard of it.
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.380]  Hey, what is Onward?
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.360]  It's a Pixar movie that came out during the pandemic.
[17:38.760 --> 17:39.740]  It's actually good.
[17:40.160 --> 17:43.760]  Yeah, it is Chris Pratt and who's the kid who plays Spider-Man?
[17:44.080 --> 17:44.420]  What's his name?
[17:44.560 --> 17:45.060]  Tom Holland.
[17:45.340 --> 17:45.720]  Yeah.
[17:46.160 --> 17:46.360]  Huh.
[17:46.420 --> 17:46.660]  Good movie.
[17:46.860 --> 17:51.040]  I tried to watch a Mario movie on a plane and that's crazy.
[17:51.120 --> 17:52.200]  I can't believe people enjoyed that.
[17:52.320 --> 17:52.920]  That's wild.
[17:53.220 --> 17:54.640]  I'm Pratt-ed out.
[17:54.880 --> 17:55.080]  Yeah.
[17:55.240 --> 17:55.920]  I'm with you.
[17:55.980 --> 17:57.040]  I think the world is Pratt-ed out.
[17:57.560 --> 17:59.620]  I'm going to guess that Onward made less.
[17:59.840 --> 18:00.660]  Yeah, definitely less.
[18:00.920 --> 18:01.500]  Definitely less.
[18:01.520 --> 18:01.920]  It bombed.
[18:02.140 --> 18:03.640]  At least for their expectation.
[18:03.740 --> 18:04.280]  It was a disappointment.
[18:04.280 --> 18:04.940]  Yeah, no kidding.
[18:05.400 --> 18:07.380]  Oh, Crimes of Grindelwald though.
[18:08.260 --> 18:15.180]  Onward, 2020, 103 million versus Fantastic Beasts, The Crimes of Grindelwald.
[18:15.180 --> 18:17.380]  Is this the second one?
[18:17.880 --> 18:18.920]  Fucking Grindelwald.
[18:19.360 --> 18:22.140]  His crimes are well known, but did people see the movie?
[18:22.440 --> 18:23.160]  What was his crimes?
[18:23.440 --> 18:24.960]  We had to ban him from our Twitch channel.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.980]  Grindelwald always causes problems.
[18:27.900 --> 18:29.740]  Grindelwald and Schindler's Fist.
[18:31.360 --> 18:32.500]  Grindelwald the frog.
[18:35.200 --> 18:35.920]  Grindel frog.
[18:36.400 --> 18:38.720]  This one's the second one in the Fantastic Beasts.
[18:38.740 --> 18:39.320]  I would say more.
[18:39.820 --> 18:40.640]  It's got to be more, right?
[18:40.700 --> 18:42.280]  More than 103 million?
[18:42.480 --> 18:42.900]  I think so.
[18:43.960 --> 18:44.260]  Okay.
[18:44.660 --> 18:46.420]  And then they replaced Johnny Depp in the next one.
[18:46.740 --> 18:46.840]  Yeah.
[18:48.000 --> 18:48.740]  654 million.
[18:49.020 --> 18:55.160]  Now Gavin, do you think Fantastic Beasts, The Crimes of Grindelwald made more or less
[18:55.160 --> 18:56.400]  than Clerks, 1994?
[18:57.340 --> 19:02.300]  It would be awesome if a film beat that, that was black and white, but only because it couldn't
[19:02.300 --> 19:02.940]  afford color.
[19:05.900 --> 19:06.380]  Less.
[19:06.840 --> 19:07.420]  You think so?
[19:07.700 --> 19:11.160]  Are you guys looking at the, uh, the image here?
[19:11.420 --> 19:11.620]  Yep.
[19:11.720 --> 19:17.240]  And it says, like, Clerks, Spesdach, Spesdachi, Spesdachi?
[19:17.960 --> 19:19.440]  Why does it say that?
[19:19.560 --> 19:19.820]  I don't know.
[19:19.820 --> 19:20.480]  Why does it say that?
[19:20.780 --> 19:22.640]  Is it like a Russian cover?
[19:23.040 --> 19:23.460]  I don't know.
[19:23.660 --> 19:23.900]  Weird.
[19:24.360 --> 19:25.420]  Anyway, uh, less.
[19:25.940 --> 19:26.240]  Okay.
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.860]  Didn't they make a cartoon of Clerks?
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.880]  Yeah, the cartoon's great.
[19:30.220 --> 19:30.380]  Yeah.
[19:30.640 --> 19:31.560]  Cartoon's a lot of fun.
[19:31.780 --> 19:32.000]  Yeah.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.460]  Could you imagine if Transformers Age of Extinction made less?
[19:39.060 --> 19:40.660]  People would have been murdered.
[19:41.400 --> 19:43.420]  Clerks made three million dollars.
[19:43.620 --> 19:46.900]  Do you think Transformers Age of Extinction made more or less than that?
[19:47.020 --> 19:48.000]  I think maybe more.
[19:48.380 --> 19:48.980]  Yeah, just a bit.
[19:49.280 --> 19:49.320]  Maybe more.
[19:49.860 --> 19:50.120]  Maybe.
[19:50.200 --> 19:51.220]  Maybe a hundred times more.
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.620]  Maybe three hundred times more.
[19:53.640 --> 19:54.840]  Another one of the fifties, whatever.
[19:55.600 --> 19:57.380]  Oh shit, now this is tough.
[19:57.980 --> 20:04.140]  Transformers Age of Extinction, one billion dollars versus Superman Returns 2006, more
[20:04.140 --> 20:05.760]  or less for Superman Returns.
[20:05.780 --> 20:11.580]  I think I remember Superman Returns being like one of the first movies to cost over
[20:11.580 --> 20:13.400]  two hundred million dollars or something.
[20:13.960 --> 20:17.280]  The way you said that sounded like it was going to be a piece of trivia that helps
[20:17.280 --> 20:19.000]  us and it was completely useless.
[20:19.300 --> 20:20.860]  Now I agree with Andrew.
[20:21.580 --> 20:25.280]  Well, just that they spent so much, they probably assumed they would make like a billion dollars,
[20:26.880 --> 20:27.360]  but...
[20:27.360 --> 20:34.200]  I think this movie led to them redoing Superman altogether, which makes me think it didn't
[20:34.200 --> 20:34.920]  do that well.
[20:35.000 --> 20:36.700]  Yeah, that's a great point, Nick.
[20:36.800 --> 20:38.860]  That is some good investigative work.
[20:38.980 --> 20:39.300]  I agree.
[20:39.420 --> 20:40.000]  I think it's less.
[20:40.900 --> 20:43.080]  I think we would have got a sequel if it did that.
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.520]  It was like a sequel of Superman.
[20:44.660 --> 20:45.700]  It was like Superman 5.
[20:46.020 --> 20:46.260]  Yes.
[20:46.800 --> 20:49.000]  Okay, Superman Returns less.
[20:49.280 --> 20:49.740]  Here we go.
[20:50.260 --> 20:50.600]  Oh yeah.
[20:51.020 --> 20:51.460]  Oh yeah.
[20:51.600 --> 20:54.120]  Three hundred ninety one million dollars.
[20:54.540 --> 20:57.640]  Now, Superman Returns, three hundred ninety one million.
[20:58.400 --> 21:00.560]  Uncut Gems 2019, more or less.
[21:01.200 --> 21:04.740]  I want to be in a group that has to debate whether it is more or less.
[21:04.880 --> 21:08.760]  I just, I want to hang out with those people and be like, it's a Sandler movie.
[21:09.400 --> 21:10.440]  It is a Sandler.
[21:10.900 --> 21:12.640]  Yeah, but people raved about this movie.
[21:13.180 --> 21:14.040]  It's definitely less.
[21:14.480 --> 21:15.600]  It's definitely less.
[21:15.720 --> 21:17.120]  Do you think it made...
[21:17.120 --> 21:17.660]  I have no idea.
[21:18.080 --> 21:19.580]  Do you think it made like 150 million?
[21:19.840 --> 21:20.540]  Oh, I don't know.
[21:20.540 --> 21:25.160]  Obviously, Uncut Gems is hard to track because I feel like the release schedule is odd.
[21:25.620 --> 21:28.960]  Or it'll be limited and then it'll get hype and then it'll come out wide later.
[21:29.180 --> 21:30.040]  But to like, what extent?
[21:30.540 --> 21:31.400]  Gavin, what do you think?
[21:31.780 --> 21:32.240]  Less?
[21:33.180 --> 21:34.220]  Less it is.
[21:35.020 --> 21:36.400]  Oh, 50 million.
[21:36.620 --> 21:36.820]  Wow.
[21:37.320 --> 21:45.280]  Terminator Dark Fate, which is the 2019 Terminator, which when we worked at Rooster Teeth,
[21:45.320 --> 21:49.440]  we went and saw in the middle of the day, one day at work,
[21:49.440 --> 21:51.080]  we just went and saw Terminator Dark Fate.
[21:51.280 --> 21:54.900]  And we took Tobin, who worked in the merch department.
[21:55.100 --> 21:57.240]  And this was the first Terminator he ever saw.
[21:57.300 --> 21:57.880]  Oh no.
[21:58.140 --> 21:58.400]  Did he like it?
[22:00.760 --> 22:02.080]  I think he left.
[22:02.220 --> 22:04.120]  It was like, yeah, I don't really like...
[22:04.120 --> 22:05.640]  I don't know that I really get it.
[22:05.720 --> 22:07.080]  But like, it was fun, I guess.
[22:07.680 --> 22:08.380]  Did you get it?
[22:08.720 --> 22:09.680]  This movie sucked.
[22:09.760 --> 22:09.960]  Yeah.
[22:10.560 --> 22:11.420]  It had two...
[22:11.420 --> 22:13.600]  It was like this endoskeleton and exoskeleton.
[22:13.760 --> 22:15.100]  And like, they didn't do anything with it.
[22:15.120 --> 22:15.620]  It sucked.
[22:16.060 --> 22:16.640]  It's terrible.
[22:16.640 --> 22:19.420]  Uh, but more, right?
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.400]  More than 50 million.
[22:20.700 --> 22:21.320]  I would think more.
[22:21.520 --> 22:22.560]  It's got Terminator in the name.
[22:22.980 --> 22:23.400]  There you go.
[22:24.180 --> 22:26.080]  261, which I think is probably low.
[22:26.340 --> 22:27.060]  Oh no.
[22:27.760 --> 22:28.180]  Wow.
[22:28.880 --> 22:31.880]  Okay, Terminator Dark Fate 2019, 261 million.
[22:32.960 --> 22:37.640]  Star Wars Empire Strikes Back from 1980, more or less than 261 million.
[22:37.820 --> 22:38.940]  Has to be more, right?
[22:39.040 --> 22:39.880]  I feel like more.
[22:40.280 --> 22:43.540]  I mean, with adjusted, it's definitely more.
[22:43.880 --> 22:44.040]  Yeah.
[22:44.160 --> 22:45.040]  Right, right.
[22:45.040 --> 22:47.260]  But we saw from Pinocchio that I don't think it's adjusted.
[22:47.660 --> 22:50.580]  Yeah, because people would see Star Wars like 35 times.
[22:50.960 --> 22:52.600]  Yeah, I still think it's more.
[22:52.800 --> 22:53.760]  Because it was before video.
[22:54.220 --> 22:54.900]  Okay, let's go.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.060]  Okay, I think it's got to be more.
[22:56.440 --> 22:56.800]  I agree.
[22:57.140 --> 22:57.460]  Here we go.
[22:57.880 --> 22:58.040]  Yeah.
[22:58.100 --> 22:58.960]  Oh, wow.
[22:59.580 --> 22:59.940]  Jeez.
[23:00.520 --> 23:00.960]  547.
[23:01.240 --> 23:03.580]  Now, here's where it gets very interesting.
[23:03.740 --> 23:04.400]  The fourth one?
[23:04.740 --> 23:12.460]  Yeah, Empire Strikes Back at 547 million versus Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides
[23:12.460 --> 23:13.700]  from 2011.
[23:13.700 --> 23:19.140]  Yeah, if I remember correctly, the only returning character from the first movies is Johnny
[23:19.140 --> 23:19.720]  Depp in this.
[23:19.800 --> 23:20.980]  Yeah, Johnny Depp.
[23:21.080 --> 23:23.180]  And I think Salma Hayek is in this one.
[23:23.180 --> 23:24.380]  Do you think that hurt it?
[23:24.580 --> 23:26.980]  Do you think it made less than 547 million?
[23:27.300 --> 23:28.180]  I don't think it hurt it.
[23:28.320 --> 23:31.260]  I think Johnny Depp is like the guy for these movies.
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.860]  I think not having him in it would hurt more than...
[23:33.860 --> 23:34.720]  Ian McShane's in it.
[23:35.380 --> 23:35.780]  Does that help?
[23:35.920 --> 23:38.660]  So is, uh, Stephen Graham.
[23:38.980 --> 23:39.380]  I don't know.
[23:39.460 --> 23:40.380]  Do you think that helped?
[23:41.180 --> 23:43.220]  Do you think people went, dude, Ian McShane's in it.
[23:43.220 --> 23:43.920]  I gotta go see this.
[23:44.060 --> 23:44.920]  Hey, man, I saw Deadwood.
[23:44.980 --> 23:45.320]  It's great.
[23:47.580 --> 23:52.220]  I'd lean towards more just because they'd wrapped up the trilogy.
[23:52.500 --> 23:53.080]  It did well.
[23:53.540 --> 23:56.820]  And this was like their new start at like doing solo movies.
[23:57.420 --> 23:58.180]  Ah, shit.
[23:58.680 --> 23:59.560]  Yeah, I'd say more.
[23:59.760 --> 24:00.580]  Globally, I think more.
[24:00.940 --> 24:01.820]  Okay, let's see.
[24:01.840 --> 24:02.080]  Here we go.
[24:02.200 --> 24:04.700]  Worldwide gross 547 million.
[24:04.860 --> 24:06.420]  We're at a score of nine.
[24:06.800 --> 24:07.740]  Oh, it did it.
[24:07.740 --> 24:08.940]  Oh, it's one of the millions.
[24:12.860 --> 24:14.380]  Ah, one billion.
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.980]  Over a billion dollars.
[24:16.320 --> 24:20.700]  Now, that's Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides versus Beauty and the Beast 2017.
[24:21.420 --> 24:26.660]  So not the original animated, the remake live action one with the cartoon, like with the
[24:26.660 --> 24:28.420]  animated beast man or whatever.
[24:28.820 --> 24:29.720]  Yeah, it looked like shit.
[24:30.220 --> 24:30.960]  And what's her name?
[24:31.020 --> 24:31.380]  Can't sing.
[24:32.240 --> 24:33.520]  I have zero read on this.
[24:34.060 --> 24:34.780]  Me too, none.
[24:34.960 --> 24:37.460]  I mean, I assume it made less than a billion dollars.
[24:37.620 --> 24:38.420]  I would think so.
[24:38.420 --> 24:43.540]  Was this at the beginning of the end of them remaking all of the nice cartoons with CG?
[24:44.000 --> 24:44.220]  No.
[24:45.100 --> 24:45.780]  They're still doing that.
[24:45.920 --> 24:46.540]  They're still doing it.
[24:46.760 --> 24:48.140]  Oh, but it's already in the shit.
[24:48.480 --> 24:50.080]  Like people already don't give a shit now, right?
[24:50.380 --> 24:51.200]  This one, no.
[24:51.720 --> 24:53.940]  This one was like the first big one.
[24:54.060 --> 24:55.300]  Snow White, absolutely bomb.
[24:55.360 --> 24:56.520]  That was the most recent one.
[24:56.740 --> 24:59.880]  But I think this was like, I think this was like the height of it.
[24:59.940 --> 25:02.460]  Yeah, this was like when people were excited about it still.
[25:03.060 --> 25:04.080]  Yeah, I don't know who.
[25:04.240 --> 25:06.920]  I don't know any of those people who were excited about it, but they were.
[25:06.920 --> 25:09.980]  Maybe it's going to be 1.047.
[25:11.660 --> 25:13.700]  Just over that 2 million mark.
[25:13.880 --> 25:14.920]  Just go right over it.
[25:15.020 --> 25:15.960]  I got to say less.
[25:16.080 --> 25:16.800]  It's got to be less than a billion.
[25:17.080 --> 25:17.400]  It's got to be less.
[25:17.740 --> 25:19.240]  I'm willing to bet it did OK, though.
[25:19.500 --> 25:20.240]  I don't.
[25:20.340 --> 25:21.420]  I'm so on the fence.
[25:21.500 --> 25:21.960]  I'm useless.
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.800]  I'm happy to go with whatever you guys think.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.420]  You got to make a call, Andrew.
[25:26.460 --> 25:27.120]  You got to make a call.
[25:28.340 --> 25:33.020]  Oh, I guess less.
[25:34.100 --> 25:36.340]  But if somebody told me it made more than a billion,
[25:36.340 --> 25:38.120]  it wouldn't be shocking to me at all.
[25:38.800 --> 25:41.380]  I bet it's over a billion.
[25:41.880 --> 25:43.080]  Oh, you think so?
[25:44.380 --> 25:45.920]  Yeah, I could see it.
[25:46.180 --> 25:46.960]  I mean, it is Disney.
[25:47.120 --> 25:48.960]  It's really the first remake of musical.
[25:49.380 --> 25:51.680]  Beauty and the Beast is fucking huge.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.560]  It's got Emma Watson in it and the dude from Downton.
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.540]  People were really excited about it, but I don't think people liked it.
[25:58.780 --> 26:02.800]  Yeah, just that doesn't mean anything, though, because they probably saw the
[26:02.800 --> 26:05.740]  shit out of it and then universally decided it was shite.
[26:05.740 --> 26:06.460]  Yeah.
[26:08.080 --> 26:09.640]  Oh, I don't know.
[26:09.680 --> 26:10.120]  Why don't we vote?
[26:10.540 --> 26:13.280]  I think we're a 2-2 if we voted as a problem.
[26:14.320 --> 26:17.260]  Yeah, but I'm running the thing, so it's up to you three.
[26:17.660 --> 26:18.520]  I lean less.
[26:18.940 --> 26:20.000]  I would go more.
[26:20.380 --> 26:20.620]  Okay.
[26:21.480 --> 26:22.500]  Well, that's you, Gavin.
[26:22.640 --> 26:23.260]  You decide.
[26:23.580 --> 26:24.140]  I'll go more.
[26:24.480 --> 26:25.340]  Okay, here we go.
[26:25.720 --> 26:27.160]  We have a score of 10 so far.
[26:27.300 --> 26:28.220]  Can we get there?
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.540]  High score of 15.
[26:29.840 --> 26:32.320]  1 billion, 45 million.
[26:32.420 --> 26:32.900]  Here we go.
[26:33.000 --> 26:33.280]  Come on.
[26:33.500 --> 26:34.320]  We are guessing more.
[26:34.640 --> 26:34.940]  Come on.
[26:35.980 --> 26:36.500]  Wow!
[26:37.380 --> 26:40.540]  1 billion, 263 million.
[26:41.880 --> 26:42.400]  Wow.
[26:43.200 --> 26:45.060]  Yeah, that surprised me.
[26:45.820 --> 26:46.340]  Crazy.
[26:46.920 --> 26:47.440]  Incredible.
[26:47.700 --> 26:48.540]  Yeah, that was the start.
[26:48.820 --> 26:56.200]  Now, it's Beauty and the Beast from 2017 at 1 billion, 263 million in Mad Max from 1979.
[26:56.700 --> 26:58.140]  Do you think it made a billion dollars?
[26:58.360 --> 26:58.560]  No.
[26:58.660 --> 27:00.940]  It's definitely less, but I'm curious to see how much it did make.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.780]  I bet it's like...
[27:02.780 --> 27:04.700]  Dude, if it's even 90 million, I'll be shocked.
[27:05.180 --> 27:06.220]  All right, here we go.
[27:06.300 --> 27:06.660]  Less.
[27:07.160 --> 27:07.860]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[27:07.920 --> 27:08.040]  Yeah.
[27:08.620 --> 27:09.660]  Not even 9 million.
[27:09.940 --> 27:11.000]  More, more, more, more.
[27:11.320 --> 27:13.280]  Mad Max made 8 million dollars.
[27:13.920 --> 27:15.680]  Knives out for 2019.
[27:16.180 --> 27:17.060]  More? Probably more.
[27:17.440 --> 27:18.480]  Probably just a little bit more, right?
[27:18.640 --> 27:21.800]  But if it was Glass Onion, it would really fuck me up because it's a Netflix movie,
[27:21.860 --> 27:24.040]  and I'm sure they released it in theaters to some extent.
[27:24.180 --> 27:25.260]  I wouldn't know how to measure that.
[27:25.740 --> 27:26.160]  I wouldn't either.
[27:26.160 --> 27:26.680]  Knives out.
[27:26.900 --> 27:27.220]  More.
[27:28.240 --> 27:28.780]  Oh, yeah.
[27:30.840 --> 27:31.560]  309 million.
[27:31.560 --> 27:38.240]  Now, it's Knives Out 2019 with 309 million versus Spider-Man 3 from 2007.
[27:38.700 --> 27:39.220]  So much more.
[27:39.940 --> 27:40.820]  It has to be more.
[27:41.040 --> 27:41.120]  Yeah.
[27:41.220 --> 27:41.940]  So much more.
[27:42.680 --> 27:44.600]  After 2, 2 is like...
[27:44.600 --> 27:47.180]  What an incredible movie Spider-Man 2 was, and then 3 came out.
[27:47.500 --> 27:50.640]  Which is the one where his boss comes off while he's stuck with the trade?
[27:51.220 --> 27:52.640]  That is 2.
[27:52.900 --> 27:53.080]  2.
[27:53.620 --> 27:56.220]  Yeah, this is the one where Venom's in it.
[27:56.260 --> 27:57.980]  Topher Grace is in it, and he's Venom.
[27:58.000 --> 27:58.180]  Yeah.
[27:58.340 --> 27:59.280]  And he has like little fangs.
[27:59.480 --> 28:00.020]  It's very funny.
[28:00.160 --> 28:00.860]  Perfectly cast.
[28:01.640 --> 28:02.060]  More.
[28:02.960 --> 28:03.960]  Damn, good for them.
[28:05.040 --> 28:10.060]  894 million dollars for Spider-Man 3 versus Halloween 1978.
[28:10.860 --> 28:11.100]  Less.
[28:11.380 --> 28:11.800]  Less.
[28:12.460 --> 28:12.780]  Think.
[28:12.980 --> 28:15.500]  I think Halloween's going to be making less than Spider-Man 3.
[28:15.620 --> 28:16.260]  That's my guess.
[28:17.400 --> 28:19.600]  When we get this here, we're going to tie our high score.
[28:19.820 --> 28:21.020]  Are you guys ready to tie the high score?
[28:21.280 --> 28:26.100]  Do you think if you combined all of John Carpenter's films, it would total 894 million?
[28:27.740 --> 28:28.160]  Maybe.
[28:28.780 --> 28:29.200]  Maybe.
[28:30.240 --> 28:31.920]  47 million on the nose.
[28:32.100 --> 28:32.540]  Look at that.
[28:32.820 --> 28:35.380]  Not a dollar over 47 million dollars.
[28:35.520 --> 28:36.660]  That's a clean number right there.
[28:37.140 --> 28:38.660]  Now, we've tied our high score.
[28:38.820 --> 28:40.120]  We are in silver medal range.
[28:40.500 --> 28:41.040]  A good try.
[28:41.580 --> 28:47.520]  Now, Halloween 1978, 47 million versus Ford versus Ferrari 2019, more or less.
[28:48.020 --> 28:48.260]  More.
[28:48.480 --> 28:48.880]  More.
[28:49.540 --> 28:53.420]  It has to be more just based on it says Matt Damon and Christian Bale.
[28:53.820 --> 28:55.820]  And that just means, I think, more automatically.
[28:56.160 --> 28:57.280]  Also says Ford and Ferrari.
[28:57.900 --> 28:58.140]  Yeah.
[28:58.780 --> 29:00.300]  But 225 million.
[29:00.680 --> 29:02.420]  You know, I think this one would be more.
[29:03.000 --> 29:03.840]  You know what?
[29:04.020 --> 29:07.440]  I think the Hobbit destination of Smaug might be more.
[29:07.860 --> 29:08.140]  Okay.
[29:08.980 --> 29:10.300]  We'll just go ahead and click on it.
[29:10.920 --> 29:12.440]  One of the six, almost.
[29:13.480 --> 29:16.140]  958 million versus Battleship 2012.
[29:17.500 --> 29:17.940]  Battleship.
[29:18.140 --> 29:18.780]  That'd be less.
[29:19.280 --> 29:20.440]  I still have never seen that movie.
[29:20.600 --> 29:21.900]  It does not make any sense to me.
[29:22.160 --> 29:23.280]  Didn't it have Rihanna?
[29:23.280 --> 29:24.420]  It does.
[29:25.320 --> 29:29.260]  I own the 360 game that's a first-person shooter, but I've never played it.
[29:29.600 --> 29:29.780]  What?
[29:30.060 --> 29:32.660]  Oh, dude, we should play it for content.
[29:32.840 --> 29:34.040]  We gotta play it for a video, dude.
[29:34.280 --> 29:36.900]  I bought it for content, but we haven't done it yet.
[29:37.000 --> 29:37.240]  Damn.
[29:37.980 --> 29:39.700]  Okay, so definitely less, right?
[29:39.840 --> 29:40.160]  Oh, yeah.
[29:40.820 --> 29:41.160]  Okay.
[29:41.820 --> 29:42.520]  303 million.
[29:42.700 --> 29:44.340]  That's a shitload for that.
[29:44.740 --> 29:45.160]  Yeah.
[29:45.700 --> 29:48.660]  Sex and the City 2008, just four years prior.
[29:49.160 --> 29:50.740]  Sex and the City, the movie.
[29:51.380 --> 29:51.740]  Passed.
[29:51.980 --> 29:54.320]  The City alone would be over 300 million.
[29:54.440 --> 29:56.200]  You add sex into the mix.
[29:56.440 --> 29:58.220]  You would think, but then...
[29:58.220 --> 29:58.740]  Nah, I don't know.
[29:58.800 --> 30:00.100]  I think the sex maybe brings it down.
[30:00.140 --> 30:00.540]  You know what I mean?
[30:00.620 --> 30:01.700]  The sex brings it down?
[30:01.700 --> 30:02.840]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[30:03.160 --> 30:04.220]  People are paying for the City.
[30:04.420 --> 30:05.520]  I would say more.
[30:06.040 --> 30:07.380]  I think the movie did really well.
[30:08.420 --> 30:08.640]  Gavin?
[30:09.040 --> 30:09.900]  Yeah, I'd go more for that.
[30:10.340 --> 30:11.880]  There's a sex in the City in the movie, too.
[30:11.960 --> 30:13.020]  There's no Battleship, too.
[30:13.180 --> 30:14.020]  Yep, true.
[30:14.820 --> 30:17.440]  418 million there for Sex and the City 2008.
[30:18.020 --> 30:18.660]  Oh, boy.
[30:18.660 --> 30:20.100]  We have to see if...
[30:20.100 --> 30:20.800]  The Lone Ranger!
[30:21.100 --> 30:21.560]  What is that?
[30:21.800 --> 30:22.540]  Nobody wanted it.
[30:22.640 --> 30:23.340]  Do I know about that?
[30:23.620 --> 30:24.040]  What do you mean?
[30:24.080 --> 30:26.740]  Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer?
[30:27.180 --> 30:28.080]  Yep, yep.
[30:28.540 --> 30:29.720]  Before he ate people or whatever.
[30:30.320 --> 30:31.640]  No, no, no, not before.
[30:32.360 --> 30:34.020]  I'm sure he was eating people during this.
[30:34.040 --> 30:35.080]  In the midst of people eating.
[30:35.640 --> 30:36.000]  Yes.
[30:36.720 --> 30:37.780]  Do you think it's less?
[30:38.220 --> 30:39.160]  I would say less, yeah.
[30:39.240 --> 30:39.660]  I think so.
[30:40.560 --> 30:41.140]  That movie sucked.
[30:42.260 --> 30:42.660]  Okay.
[30:43.860 --> 30:45.520]  260 million for the movie that sucked.
[30:46.120 --> 30:48.080]  Monsters University, we already know it's more, right?
[30:48.080 --> 30:48.620]  Okay.
[30:49.580 --> 30:50.160]  Considerably more.
[30:50.480 --> 30:51.260]  743 million.
[30:51.480 --> 30:52.260]  Terminator Salvation.
[30:52.520 --> 30:54.220]  Saw this movie in theaters.
[30:54.600 --> 30:55.740]  Good for you!
[30:58.020 --> 31:00.440]  Snuck in a bottle of whiskey with two friends.
[31:00.680 --> 31:01.920]  Hated every second of this movie.
[31:02.080 --> 31:02.660]  It was miserable.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.400]  I don't think it made 743.
[31:04.680 --> 31:05.500]  I think it did fine.
[31:05.840 --> 31:07.080]  I also don't think it did either.
[31:07.120 --> 31:09.160]  Because when I saw it in theaters, it was us.
[31:09.300 --> 31:11.700]  It was me, my two friends, and one other guy.
[31:12.160 --> 31:14.500]  So I assume nobody saw this movie.
[31:14.900 --> 31:15.740]  They didn't make a sequel.
[31:16.280 --> 31:17.620]  They kind of let this die.
[31:17.620 --> 31:19.580]  It's not the first bad one.
[31:19.720 --> 31:20.040]  No.
[31:20.260 --> 31:20.520]  No.
[31:21.060 --> 31:21.920]  No, it's not.
[31:22.920 --> 31:24.300]  So it's got to be less.
[31:24.480 --> 31:24.660]  Yep.
[31:25.020 --> 31:27.140]  And it's certainly not the last bad one either.
[31:28.740 --> 31:29.920]  371 million now.
[31:30.360 --> 31:30.760]  Cats!
[31:30.880 --> 31:32.160]  Better or worse than Terminator Salvation.
[31:32.560 --> 31:33.760]  Who remembers how much it made?
[31:33.860 --> 31:34.940]  I don't, but it's less.
[31:35.220 --> 31:36.240]  Wasn't it like 207?
[31:36.680 --> 31:37.460]  Yeah, I think it was less.
[31:37.740 --> 31:38.000]  400?
[31:38.120 --> 31:38.380]  Okay.
[31:39.060 --> 31:39.800]  Cats less.
[31:39.980 --> 31:40.400]  Here we go.
[31:40.860 --> 31:41.080]  Yeah.
[31:41.420 --> 31:42.160]  Ooh, 73.
[31:43.340 --> 31:44.920]  Django Unchained, 2012.
[31:45.180 --> 31:45.760]  That's more.
[31:46.300 --> 31:47.080]  Got to be, right?
[31:47.080 --> 31:47.440]  Yeah.
[31:47.900 --> 31:48.080]  Okay.
[31:48.680 --> 31:50.420]  Oh yeah, 425 million.
[31:51.280 --> 31:55.060]  Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales from 2017.
[31:55.380 --> 31:57.520]  How many freaking movies are there?
[31:57.720 --> 31:58.560]  This is the fifth one.
[31:59.020 --> 31:59.580]  This is the fifth one.
[31:59.900 --> 32:00.180]  It's more.
[32:00.580 --> 32:03.240]  They brought back Geoffrey Rush.
[32:03.380 --> 32:03.760]  What's his name?
[32:03.860 --> 32:04.060]  Rush?
[32:04.200 --> 32:04.340]  Yeah.
[32:04.760 --> 32:05.160]  Barbosa?
[32:05.700 --> 32:06.380]  Yeah, Barbosa.
[32:06.960 --> 32:08.340]  So we're going to say more or less?
[32:08.480 --> 32:08.680]  More.
[32:08.940 --> 32:09.680]  I guess more.
[32:09.720 --> 32:10.680]  I'd say more.
[32:10.760 --> 32:12.580]  I mean, they stopped making them after this though, didn't they?
[32:12.800 --> 32:14.080]  That might be because of Johnny Depp.
[32:14.080 --> 32:17.480]  Oh, wow.
[32:17.780 --> 32:18.800]  794 million.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.040]  That's a hell of a franchise.
[32:20.440 --> 32:20.740]  Ooh.
[32:20.820 --> 32:21.060]  Okay.
[32:21.320 --> 32:22.400]  Definitely because of Johnny Depp.
[32:23.160 --> 32:29.940]  Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Men Tell No Tales at 794 million versus just a year earlier,
[32:30.260 --> 32:32.920]  Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice.
[32:33.660 --> 32:35.640]  On paper, that feels so huge.
[32:36.160 --> 32:36.420]  Yeah.
[32:36.720 --> 32:40.000]  This was first Affleck Batman, right?
[32:40.400 --> 32:41.680]  Yes, I think so.
[32:41.680 --> 32:44.440]  This is after Man of Steel, the direct sequel.
[32:44.920 --> 32:47.120]  I bet it would be more, but like close.
[32:47.800 --> 32:48.400]  I'm good with more.
[32:48.720 --> 32:50.980]  Just on the names alone of Batman, Superman.
[32:51.520 --> 32:51.680]  Yeah?
[32:52.080 --> 32:55.140]  Yeah, because Man of Steel, people were okay with, I think.
[32:55.560 --> 32:59.520]  I think this is the era still of like, you kind of have to see every superhero movie.
[32:59.900 --> 33:00.780]  There's still that mindset.
[33:01.260 --> 33:01.840]  Here it is.
[33:01.940 --> 33:02.720]  We're saying more.
[33:02.940 --> 33:04.560]  More than 794 million.
[33:05.660 --> 33:06.040]  Ooh.
[33:06.620 --> 33:07.060]  Wow.
[33:07.240 --> 33:07.600]  That was close.
[33:08.460 --> 33:14.920]  873 million, and now this is going up against Dark Knight Rises from 2012.
[33:15.180 --> 33:16.080]  That's gotta be more, surely.
[33:16.180 --> 33:16.520]  It's gotta be.
[33:16.520 --> 33:18.120]  It has to be more, right?
[33:18.700 --> 33:18.740]  Yeah.
[33:19.560 --> 33:20.000]  Billion.
[33:20.340 --> 33:20.880]  One of the six.
[33:21.400 --> 33:22.180]  Ooh, Spectre.
[33:22.420 --> 33:23.340]  Is that the Bond movie?
[33:23.640 --> 33:24.120]  Jimmy Bond.
[33:25.120 --> 33:26.000]  Jimmy Bond.
[33:26.240 --> 33:28.340]  This is the direct sequel to Skyfall.
[33:28.800 --> 33:30.160]  It has to be less than a billion, right?
[33:30.280 --> 33:30.820]  It has to be.
[33:31.140 --> 33:31.540]  Is it?
[33:31.900 --> 33:35.860]  These all start getting muddy for me when it's like Skyfall and Spectre,
[33:35.860 --> 33:38.480]  and like the last like three that he's in, like all of that.
[33:38.660 --> 33:39.440]  I just don't know.
[33:39.920 --> 33:40.580]  I'd say less.
[33:40.720 --> 33:41.720]  They're connected somehow.
[33:41.920 --> 33:42.840]  I don't really understand.
[33:42.980 --> 33:46.480]  He had three good movies and two shit stains, and this is a shit stain.
[33:46.600 --> 33:47.360]  This is a shit stain.
[33:47.420 --> 33:49.780]  So probably, it probably fell short of a billion.
[33:50.320 --> 33:50.760]  I would think so.
[33:51.280 --> 33:52.340]  Oh, I don't know though.
[33:52.720 --> 33:53.700]  What's everyone's thoughts?
[33:54.260 --> 33:55.140]  I think it's less.
[33:55.220 --> 33:55.920]  I think it's less.
[33:56.140 --> 33:57.460]  But you're the James Bond guy.
[33:57.760 --> 33:59.460]  Nah, it was a bit of a pants one.
[33:59.600 --> 34:00.260]  It was just a bit pants.
[34:00.660 --> 34:01.260]  It was pants.
[34:01.500 --> 34:02.220]  Here it is.
[34:02.760 --> 34:03.140]  Less.
[34:05.280 --> 34:06.740]  Oh, 880 million.
[34:07.400 --> 34:10.180]  Well, the war effort is strong in 1939.
[34:11.300 --> 34:13.200]  The Wizard of Oz is in theaters.
[34:13.360 --> 34:15.840]  Did it make Spectre money?
[34:16.080 --> 34:16.800]  880 million.
[34:16.980 --> 34:22.500]  I'm gonna say it was just, I think it honestly 870 maybe for Wizard of Oz.
[34:22.760 --> 34:23.060]  Maybe.
[34:23.280 --> 34:25.120]  I think it's gonna be, I think it's gonna fall just short of Spectre.
[34:25.400 --> 34:26.540]  Yeah, just slightly.
[34:27.100 --> 34:27.820]  Okay, let's go.
[34:28.160 --> 34:28.280]  Barely.
[34:28.820 --> 34:30.160]  Oh, 26 million.
[34:30.360 --> 34:30.460]  Close.
[34:31.000 --> 34:31.900]  Oh shit.
[34:31.900 --> 34:33.360]  I would say less.
[34:33.580 --> 34:34.600]  Yeah, I think it's less.
[34:34.780 --> 34:39.240]  El Mariachi 1992 versus Wizards of Oz is 26 million.
[34:39.780 --> 34:40.460]  I have no idea.
[34:40.740 --> 34:41.400]  I haven't seen that.
[34:41.520 --> 34:42.040]  I'd go less.
[34:42.340 --> 34:44.480]  If we get this right, we'll be at 30.
[34:44.600 --> 34:46.040]  It will be doubling our high score.
[34:46.160 --> 34:46.780]  That could be gold.
[34:47.140 --> 34:48.140]  That has to be a gold.
[34:48.440 --> 34:49.000]  It has to be.
[34:49.100 --> 34:49.860]  Who was in this movie?
[34:50.300 --> 34:51.240]  You've never seen El Mariachi?
[34:51.440 --> 34:52.220]  Robert Rodriguez movie?
[34:52.440 --> 34:53.840]  It's Antonio Banderas, right?
[34:54.080 --> 34:56.040]  This is like, yeah, his first movie.
[34:56.180 --> 34:57.880]  No, this is, he's not in it.
[34:57.940 --> 35:01.440]  This is, Antonio Banderas shows up in Desperado,
[35:01.440 --> 35:02.780]  which is the sequel to this movie.
[35:03.100 --> 35:03.460]  Got it.
[35:03.660 --> 35:05.020]  But I think everybody in this is unknown.
[35:05.380 --> 35:06.380]  I think it has to be less.
[35:06.600 --> 35:08.220]  It's like Clerks was like 4 million.
[35:08.340 --> 35:09.660]  I think it's going to be like the same thing.
[35:09.820 --> 35:09.900]  Yeah.
[35:10.240 --> 35:10.700]  Oh, right.
[35:10.760 --> 35:10.920]  Okay.
[35:11.040 --> 35:12.260]  Like double, single figures.
[35:12.600 --> 35:13.220]  There you go.
[35:13.340 --> 35:13.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:13.900 --> 35:14.260]  2 million.
[35:14.480 --> 35:14.800]  Wow.
[35:15.160 --> 35:16.600]  The Gentleman 2019.
[35:16.900 --> 35:17.280]  Guy Ritchie.
[35:17.380 --> 35:18.100]  Saw this movie in theaters.
[35:18.460 --> 35:18.860]  So did I.
[35:19.080 --> 35:19.940]  Guy Ritchie joint.
[35:20.140 --> 35:22.880]  I don't think Guy Ritchie could make 2 million if he tried.
[35:23.360 --> 35:24.080]  No, I don't think he could.
[35:24.080 --> 35:29.280]  He could probably just film like a bunch of turds landing on a newspaper for 90 minutes
[35:29.280 --> 35:30.820]  and it would somehow make more than 2 million.
[35:30.820 --> 35:31.200]  Yeah.
[35:31.360 --> 35:34.980]  I mean, just in the UK, it would go crazy.
[35:35.420 --> 35:36.600]  So I'm going to say more.
[35:36.960 --> 35:38.860]  It would just be Jason Statham shitting.
[35:39.300 --> 35:39.480]  Yeah.
[35:40.060 --> 35:41.620]  Hey, where's my Rock and Roller 2?
[35:42.180 --> 35:42.500]  Come on.
[35:42.680 --> 35:43.160]  I know.
[35:43.220 --> 35:44.820]  They said there'd be a part 2.
[35:45.160 --> 35:46.880]  That is the funniest thing.
[35:47.060 --> 35:47.820]  That movie ends.
[35:47.900 --> 35:48.540]  They'll be back.
[35:48.840 --> 35:50.220]  Like what's his name?
[35:50.320 --> 35:54.460]  Like Bugsy and the crew will be back in like real Rock and Roller or whatever.
[35:54.600 --> 35:55.460]  It's so good.
[35:55.540 --> 35:56.720]  Rock and Roller forever.
[35:56.920 --> 35:57.560]  It's so goofy.
[35:57.840 --> 35:59.300]  What was that like 2008 or something?
[35:59.300 --> 36:00.780]  Yeah, I love that movie.
[36:01.180 --> 36:02.440]  Oh, I like Rock and Roller.
[36:02.440 --> 36:05.280]  I think it's a lot of fun, but we got The Gentleman.
[36:05.360 --> 36:06.100]  I like The Gentleman.
[36:06.240 --> 36:07.580]  I thought that was really good.
[36:07.860 --> 36:08.980]  Colin Farrell's so good in it.
[36:09.080 --> 36:09.720]  Charlie Hunnam, great.
[36:10.000 --> 36:11.720]  I thought Matthew McConaughey was a lot of fun in it too.
[36:11.800 --> 36:12.180]  I thought he was good.
[36:12.600 --> 36:13.020]  Hugh Grant.
[36:13.080 --> 36:13.880]  Hugh Grant was great.
[36:14.100 --> 36:14.740]  Hugh Grant is so good.
[36:14.740 --> 36:15.760]  Like a weird little accent.
[36:16.060 --> 36:16.960]  He's like a little rat man.
[36:17.040 --> 36:17.920]  He's got a weird little accent.
[36:18.180 --> 36:20.140]  He went like full Cockney, didn't he?
[36:20.360 --> 36:20.700]  He did.
[36:20.820 --> 36:24.780]  Yeah, he keeps calling him like Waymond instead of Raymond.
[36:24.880 --> 36:27.140]  Like he says all of his R's and W's for like no reason.
[36:27.200 --> 36:27.900]  It's very weird.
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.940]  Little bit of a Jonathan Ross.
[36:30.380 --> 36:30.840]  Oh yeah.
[36:31.160 --> 36:32.360]  Oh, it is Jonathan Ross.
[36:32.440 --> 36:32.640]  Yeah.
[36:32.840 --> 36:33.500]  It's so funny.
[36:33.720 --> 36:34.740]  Little bit wibbly wobbly.
[36:36.440 --> 36:37.240]  Toy Story.
[36:37.520 --> 36:37.760]  More.
[36:38.020 --> 36:38.220]  More.
[36:38.420 --> 36:38.900]  Definite more.
[36:39.440 --> 36:40.100]  404 million.
[36:40.240 --> 36:41.940]  Amazing Spider-Man from 2012.
[36:42.380 --> 36:42.820]  404.
[36:42.940 --> 36:43.540]  Definitely more.
[36:43.880 --> 36:45.180]  Felt like people were pumped for this movie.
[36:45.520 --> 36:45.900]  Absolutely.
[36:46.260 --> 36:47.660]  Spider-Man is crazy.
[36:47.940 --> 36:48.080]  Yeah.
[36:48.160 --> 36:48.960]  People love Spider-Man.
[36:49.260 --> 36:50.220]  I have never seen this movie.
[36:50.460 --> 36:50.960]  Neither have I.
[36:51.020 --> 36:51.400]  Don't be neither.
[36:51.780 --> 36:52.000]  No.
[36:52.200 --> 36:52.580]  Way more.
[36:53.020 --> 36:53.400]  Absolutely.
[36:53.540 --> 36:53.760]  Oh yeah.
[36:54.340 --> 36:54.780]  757.
[36:54.860 --> 36:55.060]  Oh.
[36:55.600 --> 36:55.760]  Oh.
[36:56.720 --> 36:57.080]  Okay.
[36:57.280 --> 36:58.480]  Now here's the thing.
[36:58.720 --> 36:59.900]  Amazing Spider-Man 2012.
[37:00.460 --> 37:04.340]  757 million versus Bad Boys for Life 2020.
[37:05.860 --> 37:07.020]  That's COVID time.
[37:07.080 --> 37:07.860]  Yeah, I think less.
[37:08.120 --> 37:09.340]  I think it would be a summer release.
[37:09.460 --> 37:10.380]  So yeah, I think it would be less.
[37:10.780 --> 37:14.880]  And how did they waste that title on the third one instead of the fourth one?
[37:15.080 --> 37:15.400]  Crazy.
[37:16.000 --> 37:16.620]  All right, here we go.
[37:17.120 --> 37:17.480]  Less.
[37:17.880 --> 37:19.460]  I guess they didn't think they were going to make another one.
[37:19.660 --> 37:20.280]  Wait, wait.
[37:21.080 --> 37:21.660]  Okay, good.
[37:22.420 --> 37:23.980]  I was about to question the whole thing.
[37:25.620 --> 37:28.820]  419 million versus Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[37:29.020 --> 37:29.120]  More.
[37:29.260 --> 37:30.200]  It's going to be one of the six.
[37:30.620 --> 37:30.780]  Yeah.
[37:30.800 --> 37:33.200]  I think the Star Wars Force Awakens made...
[37:33.200 --> 37:34.340]  I think this made pretty good money.
[37:34.580 --> 37:35.100]  Oh my god.
[37:35.460 --> 37:35.820]  Two billion.
[37:36.160 --> 37:36.960]  Okay, all right.
[37:36.980 --> 37:39.740]  Now, before we start getting up over our skis,
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.720]  Star Wars Force Awakens, two billion dollars versus Little Women 2019.
[37:43.960 --> 37:44.500]  I like it.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.040]  It's less.
[37:45.340 --> 37:46.360]  It's definitely less.
[37:46.780 --> 37:48.720]  Eric, what's your personal high score on this?
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.020]  Oh, I stopped playing.
[37:51.240 --> 37:51.460]  Okay.
[37:51.560 --> 37:52.940]  That was the first time I ever saw the end.
[37:52.940 --> 37:54.580]  I only played it like eight in a row.
[37:54.820 --> 37:55.100]  Got it.
[37:55.180 --> 37:56.260]  And then I went, oh, okay, cool.
[37:56.300 --> 37:56.820]  I got it.
[37:56.920 --> 38:02.500]  That amount there on the left was, I think, why Disney went, oh, we should do this every
[38:02.500 --> 38:03.740]  single year now.
[38:04.000 --> 38:04.340]  Yes.
[38:04.480 --> 38:04.720]  Yeah.
[38:05.040 --> 38:05.640]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:05.720 --> 38:06.040]  Absolutely.
[38:06.420 --> 38:08.620]  And the world got bored.
[38:09.040 --> 38:10.240]  And then they ruined it.
[38:10.780 --> 38:10.960]  Yep.
[38:11.340 --> 38:11.800]  Uh, okay.
[38:11.820 --> 38:12.620]  Little Women, less.
[38:12.900 --> 38:13.140]  Great.
[38:13.400 --> 38:16.100]  Bob Odenkirk being the dad in that movie really throws you off.
[38:16.280 --> 38:16.580]  Crazy.
[38:16.960 --> 38:17.840]  I think it's so funny.
[38:17.980 --> 38:18.080]  Yeah.
[38:18.080 --> 38:18.760]  I think that's great.
[38:18.880 --> 38:19.020]  Yep.
[38:19.100 --> 38:20.600]  Oh, this is interesting.
[38:20.600 --> 38:23.740]  Now, Us, 2019, did it cross 200 million?
[38:24.140 --> 38:24.320]  I think...
[38:24.320 --> 38:27.020]  I mean, it was, it was coming off of Get Out hype.
[38:27.620 --> 38:27.860]  Yeah, yeah.
[38:27.880 --> 38:31.680]  Which was a good movie and Us was, was a bad movie.
[38:31.980 --> 38:32.160]  Yeah.
[38:32.480 --> 38:35.880]  I think this, I, I think this, I think Us probably did 400.
[38:36.620 --> 38:37.480]  I take that.
[38:37.700 --> 38:37.940]  Yeah.
[38:38.860 --> 38:39.160]  That's fine.
[38:39.680 --> 38:40.100]  Wow.
[38:41.160 --> 38:42.920]  Wow, that was close.
[38:43.420 --> 38:44.500]  Well, Jumanji definitely did more.
[38:44.600 --> 38:45.140]  This did more.
[38:45.460 --> 38:46.940]  This potentially going head to head.
[38:47.140 --> 38:48.940]  Also, Jumanji, the next level from 2019.
[38:48.940 --> 38:51.640]  Was this the second one that they did or the...
[38:52.940 --> 38:53.760]  Uh, I'm not sure.
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.740]  It makes sense if it was the sequel, right?
[38:55.900 --> 38:56.820]  Because the next level.
[38:57.220 --> 38:58.540]  Man, movies make a lot of money.
[38:58.900 --> 39:04.640]  We're deep in the 2019 trenches because now we have Jumanji, the next level at 796 million
[39:04.640 --> 39:07.120]  versus 1917 from 2019.
[39:07.280 --> 39:08.040]  That movie was cool.
[39:08.820 --> 39:09.460]  I'd say less though.
[39:09.480 --> 39:10.300]  It's got to be less, right?
[39:10.500 --> 39:10.680]  Yep.
[39:10.780 --> 39:13.120]  It was marketed so much.
[39:13.300 --> 39:14.200]  Also, it was Jumanji though.
[39:14.220 --> 39:15.560]  It was, it was.
[39:15.660 --> 39:17.920]  I just don't think it did better than Jumanji.
[39:17.920 --> 39:18.700]  Less?
[39:19.520 --> 39:20.000]  Okay.
[39:20.880 --> 39:21.120]  Yeah.
[39:21.280 --> 39:21.560]  Yeah.
[39:21.640 --> 39:22.080]  Okay, cool.
[39:22.560 --> 39:23.440]  Okay, well.
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.400]  Oh, shit.
[39:24.700 --> 39:25.060]  Come on.
[39:25.240 --> 39:25.640]  Now, do you think...
[39:25.640 --> 39:26.180]  Now, right.
[39:26.260 --> 39:28.700]  But do you think Avengers Endgame did more than Little Women?
[39:29.160 --> 39:30.720]  Uh, so this is more.
[39:31.460 --> 39:32.740]  Did this cross 2 billion?
[39:33.300 --> 39:34.260]  Did it cross 3 billion?
[39:34.840 --> 39:35.360]  Yeah, right?
[39:35.480 --> 39:36.800]  Like it's, it's insane, right?
[39:37.620 --> 39:38.100]  Whoa!
[39:38.180 --> 39:38.940]  It was close.
[39:40.660 --> 39:46.840]  2 billion, 797 million against Forrest Gump from 1994.
[39:46.840 --> 39:48.680]  Life is like an infinity gauntlet.
[39:52.140 --> 39:53.440]  Let's go ahead and go less.
[39:53.720 --> 39:55.300]  Never know which stone you're gonna get.
[39:55.400 --> 39:55.640]  Damn.
[39:56.840 --> 39:59.440]  Ooh, I don't know what this is.
[39:59.500 --> 40:00.220]  It's dog shit.
[40:00.380 --> 40:01.440]  The James Franco.
[40:01.720 --> 40:02.500]  Yeah, I think less.
[40:03.300 --> 40:03.620]  Less.
[40:04.720 --> 40:06.760]  Yeah, I'd still say less.
[40:07.500 --> 40:08.680]  Less than Forrest Gump.
[40:08.840 --> 40:10.980]  Gump at 678 million.
[40:11.640 --> 40:13.300]  Oz the Great and Powerful, you're gonna say less.
[40:13.540 --> 40:14.440]  Yeah, I'm gonna say less.
[40:15.180 --> 40:15.560]  Gavin?
[40:15.560 --> 40:17.220]  Sure, I have no idea about this movie.
[40:17.520 --> 40:18.960]  I don't know anything about this movie.
[40:19.180 --> 40:20.240]  I didn't know it got made.
[40:20.400 --> 40:22.380]  I don't remember it doing well at all.
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.840]  Okay, less. Here we go.
[40:25.400 --> 40:25.860]  Wow.
[40:26.000 --> 40:26.560]  Not much less.
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.900]  493 million versus The Hobbit, The Battle of the Five Armies from 2014.
[40:32.160 --> 40:32.580]  The third one.
[40:32.900 --> 40:33.520]  The third one.
[40:33.860 --> 40:34.060]  More.
[40:34.720 --> 40:35.020]  More.
[40:35.580 --> 40:39.660]  Easily more. We've already kind of previewed The Hobbit. I think we can lock in more.
[40:40.380 --> 40:40.680]  Gavin?
[40:40.980 --> 40:41.220]  Yeah.
[40:45.140 --> 40:45.640]  956.
[40:45.740 --> 40:49.400]  The Artist, which had the dog, there's a black and white dog.
[40:49.700 --> 40:49.940]  Yeah.
[40:50.200 --> 40:51.020]  That's all I know from it.
[40:51.140 --> 40:53.160]  The silent film, so I'm gonna say less.
[40:53.460 --> 40:56.900]  It's a silent film from 2011. I'm gonna guess less.
[40:57.400 --> 40:58.120]  Yeah, I'd say less.
[40:58.520 --> 41:01.240]  Sod theaters with maybe seven other old people.
[41:01.600 --> 41:01.780]  Yeah.
[41:03.740 --> 41:04.600]  133 million.
[41:04.880 --> 41:07.440]  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 2019.
[41:07.940 --> 41:09.300]  Probably just a little bit more.
[41:09.640 --> 41:10.280]  Didn't see it though.
[41:10.560 --> 41:10.940]  It's great.
[41:10.940 --> 41:14.800]  I liked it. I mean, I don't love that. It's like definitely not my favorite Tarantino movie,
[41:14.960 --> 41:16.580]  but there are moments of it that I really like.
[41:16.660 --> 41:17.540]  Is that the last one he did?
[41:17.920 --> 41:18.160]  Yep.
[41:18.360 --> 41:18.500]  Yeah.
[41:18.780 --> 41:18.960]  Yeah.
[41:19.660 --> 41:21.040]  Friday the 13th, 1980.
[41:21.560 --> 41:21.820]  Less.
[41:22.400 --> 41:22.980]  Yeah, less.
[41:23.460 --> 41:24.680]  Do you think it was 20 million?
[41:25.620 --> 41:28.620]  Yeah, I mean, we got early Kevin Bacon in it.
[41:29.580 --> 41:33.360]  I think the hype was that it was making people sick in the theater or whatever.
[41:33.780 --> 41:34.380]  Undercooked bacon.
[41:34.880 --> 41:36.300]  It was uncooked bacon.
[41:36.780 --> 41:37.480]  Uh, here we go.
[41:37.820 --> 41:38.540]  People were scared.
[41:38.540 --> 41:40.740]  Wow, good for 39 million.
[41:41.260 --> 41:43.100]  Oh, The Irishman, which was a Netflix.
[41:43.200 --> 41:44.780]  Wasn't that like a Netflix release?
[41:45.060 --> 41:46.180]  It's a Netflix movie.
[41:46.500 --> 41:48.860]  Wasn't it like three and something hours long or something?
[41:49.120 --> 41:49.680]  Yeah, it was.
[41:50.100 --> 41:53.540]  And they did a lot of CG to make young them.
[41:53.940 --> 41:56.200]  Yeah, yeah, dude. And it worked so well.
[41:56.260 --> 41:58.520]  He looked so young in the movie, dude.
[41:58.560 --> 41:59.120]  It worked.
[41:59.380 --> 42:03.200]  When he was walking around, I went, whoa, this is a young De Niro for sure.
[42:03.680 --> 42:07.940]  Like I can definitely look at how young he looks is what I kept saying out loud.
[42:07.940 --> 42:10.080]  Look at that old man walk on a young man's body.
[42:10.340 --> 42:12.120]  It's got to be more.
[42:12.460 --> 42:13.360]  Even if it's on Netflix.
[42:13.840 --> 42:16.260]  But it still had a theatrical release and it was.
[42:16.440 --> 42:18.900]  All right. I would go. I would go less.
[42:19.240 --> 42:20.380]  Oh my God.
[42:20.660 --> 42:21.480]  You think it'd be less?
[42:21.660 --> 42:22.820]  My vote is for less.
[42:23.540 --> 42:23.980]  Damn.
[42:24.540 --> 42:26.840]  But just mainly because it was streamed.
[42:27.140 --> 42:29.540]  Yeah, I think it was largely watched on Netflix.
[42:30.060 --> 42:31.280]  I would say less. Yeah.
[42:31.600 --> 42:34.440]  Okay, Gavin, do you say more or less?
[42:34.440 --> 42:40.360]  Oh, I think it fulfilled the obligations you need to be nominated for an Oscar as far as
[42:40.360 --> 42:47.440]  theatrical goes, but I don't think $40 million worth of people saw the Irishman in theaters.
[42:47.820 --> 42:49.940]  All right, I'll go along with it.
[42:50.060 --> 42:51.220]  All right, less it is.
[42:51.500 --> 42:52.280]  Will it be less?
[42:52.320 --> 42:53.760]  Our streak's at 46 so far.
[42:54.240 --> 42:56.200]  39 million is what we have to be the Irishman.
[42:56.300 --> 42:57.180]  We're saying less.
[42:57.940 --> 42:58.980]  Holy shit.
[42:59.420 --> 43:02.840]  Yeah, $968,000.
[43:02.840 --> 43:04.720]  It's probably in like 10 theaters.
[43:05.160 --> 43:05.820]  Wow.
[43:06.380 --> 43:06.880]  More.
[43:07.540 --> 43:13.120]  Okay, now, did Avatar from 2009 make more than $968,000?
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.140]  Did it break $1 million?
[43:14.280 --> 43:15.020]  I don't remember.
[43:15.240 --> 43:17.340]  I'm going to guess at least a thousand times more.
[43:17.860 --> 43:18.280]  Okay.
[43:19.840 --> 43:21.400]  Oh my God.
[43:21.940 --> 43:24.240]  Okay, 2,700 times more.
[43:27.960 --> 43:29.320]  We're never going to die.
[43:31.280 --> 43:37.840]  Avatar, $2,790,000 versus Fast and Furious Hobbes and Shaw, which I think I saw in theaters with
[43:37.840 --> 43:38.280]  you, Gavin.
[43:38.600 --> 43:39.440]  Did we see it at D-Box?
[43:40.000 --> 43:41.920]  Yeah. I wanted to like it so much.
[43:42.240 --> 43:43.720]  Oh yeah, I wanted to like this movie.
[43:43.920 --> 43:47.860]  There's so many cool guy things individually in this movie, but it just sucks.
[43:48.480 --> 43:52.900]  It was when they were trying to like pull a helicopter down to the ground by driving
[43:52.900 --> 43:53.420]  faster.
[43:53.600 --> 43:55.720]  Yes, and then like the rock holds it.
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.460]  I think my favorite is him running down the side of a building and firing his gun to slow
[44:00.460 --> 44:01.300]  down his speed.
[44:01.400 --> 44:02.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:02.360 --> 44:04.740]  There's so many like individual cool things.
[44:05.140 --> 44:05.700]  Yep.
[44:06.140 --> 44:07.080]  Definitely less.
[44:07.440 --> 44:08.520]  It still did great.
[44:10.200 --> 44:11.320]  $759 million.
[44:11.940 --> 44:14.120]  Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian.
[44:14.640 --> 44:15.200]  Less.
[44:15.800 --> 44:16.300]  Less.
[44:16.980 --> 44:17.180]  Yeah.
[44:18.060 --> 44:19.000]  It has to be, right?
[44:19.040 --> 44:19.820]  Yeah, definitely less.
[44:20.980 --> 44:21.900]  $419 million.
[44:22.020 --> 44:23.280]  Captain Marvel 2019.
[44:23.760 --> 44:24.500]  Did it go over?
[44:24.500 --> 44:26.860]  Did it cross the $419 million mark?
[44:27.420 --> 44:30.000]  I bet it crossed a billion, but it was the beginning of the end.
[44:30.540 --> 44:31.720]  Yeah, you think it's a billion?
[44:31.740 --> 44:33.080]  You think Captain Marvel is a billion?
[44:33.400 --> 44:34.380]  You think it's one of the six?
[44:34.760 --> 44:36.080]  I think it could be one of the six.
[44:36.440 --> 44:37.160]  Oh, I don't know.
[44:37.200 --> 44:38.620]  We're running out of room on this six.
[44:39.320 --> 44:41.380]  We at least have seven so far in the six.
[44:41.480 --> 44:43.880]  I don't know if we're going to sneak another one in.
[44:44.440 --> 44:47.780]  Wouldn't this be between Infinity War and Endgame?
[44:47.880 --> 44:48.880]  Yes, it is.
[44:48.960 --> 44:50.300]  Yeah, I think it's more.
[44:50.600 --> 44:51.700]  It's got to be one of the six.
[44:51.860 --> 44:52.940]  But I don't think it's a billion.
[44:54.140 --> 44:55.580]  Okay, more it is.
[44:55.620 --> 44:56.120]  Here we go.
[44:56.600 --> 44:57.320]  It's a billion.
[44:58.980 --> 45:00.860]  1,128,000,000.
[45:01.900 --> 45:02.420]  Twilight.
[45:02.800 --> 45:03.920]  We're going to go ahead and just go less.
[45:05.020 --> 45:05.540]  Cool.
[45:06.220 --> 45:06.960]  408 million.
[45:07.280 --> 45:08.600]  Spongebob movie 2004.
[45:08.900 --> 45:09.980]  I have no fucking idea.
[45:10.380 --> 45:10.800]  Oh no.
[45:10.900 --> 45:11.340]  No clue.
[45:11.860 --> 45:12.360]  No clue.
[45:13.020 --> 45:14.100]  Our streak right now?
[45:14.220 --> 45:14.520]  52.
[45:14.780 --> 45:15.620]  I'd say less.
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.020]  I feel good about the streak.
[45:17.720 --> 45:18.240]  2004.
[45:19.100 --> 45:21.780]  Was it still like popular on TV in 2004?
[45:22.220 --> 45:22.800]  Yeah, it was.
[45:22.800 --> 45:26.600]  I think it was popular on TV past like 2008.
[45:26.920 --> 45:32.460]  I never liked Spongebob, but I went to a Spongebob birthday party where we watched this in a packed theater.
[45:32.840 --> 45:33.300]  Oh wow.
[45:33.720 --> 45:34.580]  So do you think it did more?
[45:35.020 --> 45:37.240]  I mean, kid shit does deceptively well.
[45:37.800 --> 45:37.980]  Yeah.
[45:38.440 --> 45:38.880]  Yeah.
[45:39.480 --> 45:44.060]  I mean, it was definitely a big deal still as a kid then.
[45:44.620 --> 45:50.580]  I think it did well, but I don't think it did more than Twilight.
[45:50.580 --> 45:54.080]  I'm 10, so I have no read on this in any case.
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.140]  I was still too scared to watch Shaun of the Dead at this age, distinctively.
[45:58.280 --> 45:59.120]  I'm about 2004.
[46:01.140 --> 46:02.200]  So we're gonna go less?
[46:02.480 --> 46:03.360]  I'm gonna go less.
[46:03.760 --> 46:04.160]  Okay.
[46:04.380 --> 46:04.740]  Here we go.
[46:04.800 --> 46:05.080]  Less.
[46:05.540 --> 46:06.400]  408 million.
[46:06.560 --> 46:07.320]  This might break us.
[46:08.200 --> 46:08.360]  Oh!
[46:09.580 --> 46:12.600]  141 million versus The Lion King 2019.
[46:13.200 --> 46:13.760]  Lion King.
[46:14.120 --> 46:14.560]  More.
[46:14.580 --> 46:14.740]  Yeah.
[46:14.840 --> 46:15.900]  Yeah, I guess way more.
[46:16.160 --> 46:17.140]  Has to be more, right?
[46:17.260 --> 46:17.420]  Yeah.
[46:17.460 --> 46:19.980]  Yeah, this is still before people were sick of it.
[46:19.980 --> 46:21.080]  Holy shit!
[46:21.620 --> 46:22.700]  Oh, it's one of the six!
[46:24.420 --> 46:25.340]  1.656.
[46:25.900 --> 46:26.720]  That's insane.
[46:27.020 --> 46:29.300]  But Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring.
[46:29.600 --> 46:31.760]  I mean, it deserves to have made more, but...
[46:31.760 --> 46:32.400]  I would say less.
[46:32.420 --> 46:32.920]  I don't think it did.
[46:33.160 --> 46:33.880]  I assume less.
[46:34.320 --> 46:35.020]  I would think less.
[46:35.420 --> 46:36.320]  Wow, isn't that insane?
[46:38.840 --> 46:42.280]  187 million versus 2012 from 2009.
[46:43.440 --> 46:46.220]  It is really funny to see 2012, 2009.
[46:48.720 --> 46:51.680]  Aka, I'm glad I'm not where I was 10 feet ago.
[46:51.840 --> 46:52.080]  The movie.
[46:52.420 --> 46:52.540]  Yes.
[46:52.860 --> 46:53.060]  Yeah.
[46:53.320 --> 46:53.700]  Absolutely.
[46:53.960 --> 46:54.440]  Great joke by Jack.
[46:54.520 --> 46:54.760]  Less.
[46:55.240 --> 46:56.140]  Definitely less, right?
[46:58.000 --> 46:59.340]  Correct way to go, Jack.
[46:59.920 --> 47:00.220]  Less.
[47:00.720 --> 47:01.360]  It's less, yeah.
[47:01.520 --> 47:02.620]  It's significantly less.
[47:03.200 --> 47:03.640]  Whoa!
[47:04.060 --> 47:04.500]  No, it wasn't!
[47:04.800 --> 47:05.900]  No, it wasn't!
[47:06.320 --> 47:07.240]  Good for Roland.
[47:09.260 --> 47:11.620]  791 million versus Incredibles 2.
[47:11.760 --> 47:12.520]  Do you remember?
[47:13.060 --> 47:13.740]  I don't!
[47:13.780 --> 47:14.220]  It was better.
[47:14.400 --> 47:15.060]  It was more, right?
[47:15.120 --> 47:15.840]  Isn't that how we lost?
[47:15.840 --> 47:17.220]  Yeah, that's how we lost.
[47:17.300 --> 47:18.000]  I think so, yeah.
[47:18.360 --> 47:19.240]  It's gotta be more.
[47:19.520 --> 47:19.740]  Yeah.
[47:19.860 --> 47:20.140]  More?
[47:20.360 --> 47:20.600]  Yeah.
[47:20.720 --> 47:21.020]  More.
[47:21.640 --> 47:21.920]  More.
[47:22.560 --> 47:22.780]  Yeah!
[47:22.840 --> 47:24.780]  1,212,000,000.
[47:24.780 --> 47:25.080]  Oh, shit!
[47:25.400 --> 47:26.980]  That is impossible.
[47:27.980 --> 47:28.360]  No, more.
[47:28.660 --> 47:29.020]  Way more.
[47:29.240 --> 47:29.680]  Way more.
[47:29.860 --> 47:30.200]  Way more.
[47:30.300 --> 47:34.820]  Once again, I go, Incredibles 2, that made less, but that's not the game we're playing.
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.160]  More!
[47:36.100 --> 47:37.260]  You think way more, though?
[47:37.580 --> 47:39.240]  I think it is because they made another sequel.
[47:39.620 --> 47:41.520]  No, it's just, yeah, this movie is so big.
[47:41.940 --> 47:44.240]  1.5 bill is what I'm saying.
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.780]  I know it's big, but I think you're underestimating how big 1.2 billion is.
[47:49.220 --> 47:50.500]  No, it's huge.
[47:50.860 --> 47:51.840]  Absolutely huge.
[47:52.040 --> 47:53.100]  I think 3 was big.
[47:53.840 --> 47:54.940]  Gavin, do you say more or less?
[47:55.420 --> 47:58.620]  I mean, I bet it's one of the six, but I bet it's less.
[47:59.740 --> 48:01.040]  Oh, you think it is less?
[48:01.240 --> 48:02.040]  But I'm outvoted.
[48:02.400 --> 48:03.660]  Okay, more it is.
[48:03.700 --> 48:04.120]  Here we go.
[48:04.780 --> 48:05.200]  We lost!
[48:07.500 --> 48:10.660]  1,066,000,000 gold medal.
[48:10.680 --> 48:11.580]  But we did the gold.
[48:13.140 --> 48:14.100]  Oh, wow.
[48:14.100 --> 48:14.640]  We did.
[48:15.580 --> 48:16.240]  And that was great.
[48:16.440 --> 48:20.280]  Could you believe we saw all six billion dollar movies in the quiz?
[48:20.680 --> 48:21.220]  Insane.
[48:22.900 --> 48:23.440]  Insane.
[48:23.880 --> 48:28.820]  Well, thanks for checking out regulation over under an idea I had while mowing the yard.
[48:29.580 --> 48:32.220]  Really appreciate you guys giving this a try.
[48:32.520 --> 48:36.740]  I feel like getting 57 in a row as a team, great.
[48:36.940 --> 48:37.460]  So good.
[48:37.740 --> 48:42.780]  And now, and now Geoff, I feel like Geoff is at a disadvantage going into the summer movie
[48:42.780 --> 48:44.580]  auction because he doesn't know how much movies cost.
[48:44.580 --> 48:45.620]  He has no idea.
[48:46.100 --> 48:47.740]  This guy's screwed, dude.
[48:47.980 --> 48:48.920]  He has no idea.
[48:49.700 --> 48:50.840]  Thanks for checking this out.
[48:50.920 --> 48:51.560]  Check out the podcast.

[48:58.420 --> 48:59.000]  Could be.
[48:59.480 --> 49:00.920]  But until next time, we'll see you later.
[49:01.340 --> 49:01.640]  Bye!
