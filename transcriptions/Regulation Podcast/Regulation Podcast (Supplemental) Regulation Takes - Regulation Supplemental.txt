[00:00.000 --> 00:05.700]  Hello and welcome to our newest supplemental concept idea, Regulation Takes.
[00:06.100 --> 00:07.580]  I am hosting this.
[00:07.980 --> 00:08.800]  I can't believe it.
[00:09.360 --> 00:13.160]  I am joined alongside Eric, Gavin and Nick.
[00:13.600 --> 00:15.120]  I'm excited to hear some takes.
[00:15.160 --> 00:17.760]  Let me explain the takes format before we get going.
[00:18.140 --> 00:23.040]  We have all prepared takes which are stances in which we feel passionate about.
[00:23.400 --> 00:26.680]  We will share our takes one at a time.
[00:26.980 --> 00:29.200]  I'm not sure how many we'll do this first time we're doing it.
[00:29.200 --> 00:31.020]  Who knows how long this is going to be?
[00:31.400 --> 00:32.420]  We'll have to figure that out.
[00:32.540 --> 00:34.240]  You'll see. I guess you'll know going into it.
[00:34.260 --> 00:35.900]  You'll see the timer, but we don't know.
[00:36.400 --> 00:37.620]  So we'll all say our takes.
[00:37.920 --> 00:41.320]  Then after this comes out, I will put out a poll on our Patreon,
[00:41.640 --> 00:43.240]  which is the regulation pod.
[00:43.540 --> 00:45.700]  And you can vote on who had the worst take.
[00:46.100 --> 00:49.460]  And whoever has the worst take or takes gets the idiot flag.
[00:49.780 --> 00:50.640]  Till the next episode.
[00:51.140 --> 00:51.760]  Deem the idiot.
[00:52.120 --> 00:52.960]  But it's not a draft.
[00:53.440 --> 00:54.980]  It's not a draft. No.
[00:55.340 --> 00:55.920]  I'll be honest.
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.040]  I was I was like 80% sure you were somehow going to call a blindside
[01:00.040 --> 01:05.000]  and we'd be doing ratting because this sounds like a fake idea.
[01:05.560 --> 01:08.100]  Oh, this is so far from a fake idea.
[01:08.580 --> 01:12.260]  This is like the most popular idea in any show format ever.
[01:12.580 --> 01:16.420]  Oh yeah. This is a I could tell it was a real Andrew idea
[01:16.420 --> 01:19.100]  because this is the closest we're going to get to like sports
[01:20.220 --> 01:22.180]  media. You know what I mean?
[01:22.220 --> 01:23.340]  Like this is so close.
[01:23.340 --> 01:25.460]  Hot take. First take.
[01:25.840 --> 01:30.120]  Like that kind of thing that I read is true to me all the way.
[01:30.680 --> 01:32.260]  Well, until we do a March Madness bracket.
[01:32.760 --> 01:34.380]  Right. True. Yeah.
[01:34.520 --> 01:36.460]  But this is, again, not a draft.
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.000]  The first thing Gavin asked when he got here today, is this a draft?
[01:40.480 --> 01:42.700]  We reassured him. No, it's not.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.020]  The pool is takes.
[01:44.660 --> 01:46.900]  Yeah. Yeah. The pool is takes, but the pool is.
[01:47.080 --> 01:49.340]  But also there's no real pool because it's not a draft.
[01:49.340 --> 01:54.460]  Oh, so, Andrew, how many takes are I mean, we'll go one at a time,
[01:54.500 --> 01:57.580]  but how many takes are we going to be giving each?
[01:57.820 --> 01:58.640]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:58.700 --> 02:01.440]  I don't know how long it'll take for us to go through everybody's takes.
[02:01.500 --> 02:02.400]  It'll be interesting to see.
[02:02.580 --> 02:03.980]  So maybe we'll do one each.
[02:04.060 --> 02:05.280]  Maybe we'll do two each.
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.500]  We will state our take and then you can sort of defend
[02:09.500 --> 02:10.980]  or maybe people just agree.
[02:11.360 --> 02:13.340]  And that's the support of the take.
[02:13.860 --> 02:16.380]  This is a thing I largely wanted to do
[02:16.380 --> 02:19.060]  because I have a take that I think about all the time
[02:19.060 --> 02:21.140]  that I don't know how else to put it.
[02:21.340 --> 02:23.300]  Like there's this can't be a draft.
[02:23.440 --> 02:25.460]  This isn't really a podcast subject.
[02:25.900 --> 02:28.720]  So I had to create a show around
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.620]  being able to discuss this take.
[02:31.880 --> 02:34.140]  I have an opinion. I need a show.
[02:34.180 --> 02:35.280]  I have an opinion.
[02:35.580 --> 02:37.780]  We need a vehicle to discuss this opinion.
[02:38.240 --> 02:40.000]  It's an opinion I have not heard often.
[02:40.080 --> 02:43.740]  But how do we determine the order of delivering these takes?
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.160]  Well, you should go first because you built a show around your take.
[02:46.160 --> 02:48.060]  Yeah, I absolutely think you should go first.
[02:48.200 --> 02:51.180]  I think we could also go in Discord order,
[02:51.360 --> 02:54.640]  which is just our names in order here, which appears to be alphabetical.
[02:55.180 --> 02:58.480]  So maybe we just go that way and we'll see how it goes.
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.820]  Now, you mentioned a timer. Is there a timer?
[03:01.300 --> 03:04.400]  No, no, not a timer for the take, but I just know maybe like
[03:04.880 --> 03:06.720]  somebody's take will take four minutes to do.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.600]  Maybe somebody's will take. Oh, OK.
[03:08.800 --> 03:10.800]  Like, I just wanted to make sure I didn't have to run it.
[03:10.880 --> 03:12.120]  No, no, no. You don't have to.
[03:12.200 --> 03:14.820]  This isn't like a strict debate format or anything.
[03:14.820 --> 03:17.480]  I don't know. Gavin didn't even know if this was a draft or not.
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.780]  So I just don't know. That's my only question.
[03:20.100 --> 03:22.100]  Yeah, yeah. Really? Gavin rebuttal. Yeah.
[03:24.900 --> 03:27.540]  Andrew, why don't you lead us off with your first take?
[03:27.960 --> 03:31.400]  My first take is something I think about all the time.
[03:31.800 --> 03:33.320]  It's a weird thing to think about all the time.
[03:33.400 --> 03:34.080]  I'll acknowledge that.
[03:34.480 --> 03:36.940]  But it is something I think about quite frequently.
[03:37.640 --> 03:41.440]  My first take is that Taylor Kitsch deserves better.
[03:42.080 --> 03:47.740]  Taylor Kitsch has one of the worst acting careers in modern times.
[03:47.840 --> 03:50.840]  And I don't think it's his fault at all. I think he's pretty good.
[03:51.320 --> 03:53.060]  I think he's a solid actor.
[03:53.620 --> 03:56.900]  He was on Friday Night Lights, which is incredibly popular.
[03:57.420 --> 04:01.920]  And he has a run of things that just like were terrible,
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.400]  but not terrible because it was his fault.
[04:04.800 --> 04:10.580]  My first example of this is he got to be Gambit in X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[04:10.580 --> 04:14.360]  He was Gambit. Yes, he was fine as Gambit.
[04:14.740 --> 04:16.460]  But that movie was terrible.
[04:16.860 --> 04:19.260]  And like nothing expanded beyond that.
[04:19.740 --> 04:22.160]  It was a weird thing to read about the history of it,
[04:22.180 --> 04:25.660]  where they always wanted Channing Tatum, but he was always busy.
[04:25.920 --> 04:28.500]  And so they booked him because it's like he wasn't available.
[04:29.020 --> 04:31.540]  But they gave him a three movie deal, which did not happen.
[04:32.060 --> 04:36.160]  There was only a singular cameo because nobody liked X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[04:36.540 --> 04:39.560]  Yeah. A beloved character in a beloved series of films.
[04:39.560 --> 04:42.440]  I think this is the most hated one by far.
[04:42.520 --> 04:47.400]  Oh, he just happened to be in the worst Wolverine that they could possibly make.
[04:47.800 --> 04:51.060]  You created an entire show for that take.
[04:51.720 --> 04:53.920]  Oh, I'm not done. I'm not done.
[04:54.360 --> 04:55.560]  I'm going to establish more. Right.
[04:55.920 --> 05:00.820]  And to be fair, it will still be the same take as he continues to argue this.
[05:01.060 --> 05:04.140]  So the answer to your question is yes. I'm just solidifying the take.
[05:04.520 --> 05:07.280]  Uh huh. Right. And so the answer to your question is yes, Gavin.
[05:07.820 --> 05:10.980]  We often talk about 1994.
[05:11.280 --> 05:12.560]  Amazing Jim Carrey here.
[05:12.900 --> 05:14.480]  One of the best years. Oh, big film.
[05:14.920 --> 05:17.180]  Rennie, three absolute bangers.
[05:17.700 --> 05:20.940]  Taylor Kitsch had maybe the worst version of that
[05:20.940 --> 05:23.820]  where he had a 2012.
[05:24.780 --> 05:26.040]  2012 was really bad.
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.140]  John Carter from Mars, Battleship and Savages.
[05:30.620 --> 05:32.620]  Yeah, all three of those. Not his fault.
[05:33.120 --> 05:34.480]  Yeah. John Carter was terrible.
[05:34.720 --> 05:36.160]  It was just like a soulless CG.
[05:36.160 --> 05:38.180]  It just was weird. There's no heart to it.
[05:38.600 --> 05:40.480]  Nobody came out of John Carter looking good.
[05:41.940 --> 05:43.600]  Battleship, absolute disaster.
[05:43.980 --> 05:45.440]  Just a terrible film.
[05:45.700 --> 05:46.680]  Not his fault.
[05:47.380 --> 05:51.820]  Savages, an Oliver Stone movie that had like all the pieces to be good,
[05:51.860 --> 05:54.860]  like you'd understand from the outside, wanting to be in an Oliver Stone movie
[05:54.860 --> 05:55.280]  as a lead.
[05:55.700 --> 05:57.900]  All the acting in that movie is great.
[05:57.940 --> 06:01.060]  All around, just a really dumb, bad story.
[06:01.480 --> 06:02.180]  Yeah, not great.
[06:02.180 --> 06:07.800]  Savages has like Benicio Del Toro and Aaron Taylor Johnson and stuff like that.
[06:07.900 --> 06:09.280]  Like it has like a bunch of people.
[06:09.720 --> 06:10.180]  Yeah, it is.
[06:10.300 --> 06:14.360]  It is a weird thing where I would argue he was the only one impacted
[06:14.360 --> 06:15.780]  by the failure of Savages.
[06:16.060 --> 06:17.360]  100% absolutely agree.
[06:17.940 --> 06:21.620]  John Carter was like this also $300 million Disney movie
[06:22.220 --> 06:23.340]  that was terrible.
[06:23.860 --> 06:25.060]  It just nobody saw it.
[06:25.120 --> 06:25.980]  It was a huge flop.
[06:26.320 --> 06:28.820]  It was a summer flop for Taylor Kitsch.
[06:28.820 --> 06:32.940]  And I feel like that completely broke the wings
[06:32.940 --> 06:35.580]  off of what his career trajectory could be.
[06:35.800 --> 06:38.560]  But he had to fade into the distance.
[06:38.720 --> 06:42.480]  And so he was he went he went quiet for a little bit off the grid.
[06:42.780 --> 06:45.160]  He went dark. He then came back.
[06:45.280 --> 06:47.880]  I mean, he had Lone Survivor, which was like it was fine.
[06:48.780 --> 06:51.940]  But then he got booked on True Detective season two.
[06:52.200 --> 06:55.400]  True Detective, the biggest show of that year.
[06:55.800 --> 06:58.140]  Everyone's loving it. It's a critical darling.
[06:58.140 --> 07:01.000]  They're running it back for season two.
[07:01.620 --> 07:02.880]  Everyone's so excited.
[07:03.300 --> 07:05.340]  And then everybody hated season two.
[07:05.820 --> 07:09.340]  Yeah, it is the worst reviewed season
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.340]  of True Detective with a 61%.
[07:13.340 --> 07:16.440]  Once again, he was totally fine.
[07:16.480 --> 07:17.460]  And he was good.
[07:17.720 --> 07:19.980]  I would say good performance by Taylor Kitsch.
[07:20.420 --> 07:25.020]  Just everything he touches is the worst version of that thing.
[07:25.100 --> 07:27.200]  But it is in no way his fault.
[07:27.820 --> 07:30.200]  He should be in most of the action roles
[07:30.200 --> 07:33.320]  that John Krasinski has had in like the last five years.
[07:33.620 --> 07:35.240]  Like he would be so much better.
[07:35.460 --> 07:39.160]  And all these sort of I'm not saying that he's an Oscar winning actor
[07:39.160 --> 07:43.240]  and that he should have been in these epic dramas.
[07:43.240 --> 07:47.200]  But like any kind of generic John Krasinski action movie,
[07:47.200 --> 07:49.600]  I think he would have been significantly better.
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.580]  Oh, I think that he's the reason his career is what it is,
[07:53.580 --> 07:54.940]  is because of Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[07:54.940 --> 07:58.720]  He that that role is filled by Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[07:58.880 --> 08:02.540]  If Aaron Taylor Johnson did not exist, this guy's working.
[08:02.760 --> 08:04.940]  This guy's working everything without him.
[08:05.020 --> 08:09.940]  It has been an interesting he's had to go on like Netflix type series
[08:09.940 --> 08:11.460]  and he's building things back up.
[08:11.760 --> 08:14.160]  But I just think it's it's such a weird career
[08:14.740 --> 08:18.540]  where everything that he did, like I understand, accepting and being like,
[08:18.580 --> 08:20.260]  yeah, I'm going to be in a fucking Wolverine movie.
[08:20.480 --> 08:21.600]  I'm going to be in this.
[08:21.660 --> 08:24.120]  I'm going to be in a I'm going to be the lead of a Disney epic
[08:24.120 --> 08:26.880]  for like 400 million, like a huge box office movie.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.780]  But none of it worked and none of it was his fault.
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.680]  And I just think that's incredibly fascinating.
[08:32.360 --> 08:35.700]  The king of good franchise, like stick out stinkers.
[08:36.080 --> 08:39.900]  Like he's always in the most dog shit version of the actual product.
[08:40.340 --> 08:45.120]  Absolutely. And I just I think it's such a fascinating career trajectory.
[08:45.480 --> 08:51.060]  If you gave me an infinite amount of time and 500 million different guesses
[08:51.060 --> 08:52.480]  on what your take was going to be,
[08:52.480 --> 08:54.460]  I still wouldn't have come up with it.
[08:54.540 --> 08:56.080]  No, no, absolutely.
[08:56.220 --> 08:57.960]  He created a show, Gavin.
[08:58.180 --> 08:59.120]  He created a show.
[08:59.200 --> 09:00.600]  So he can explain this to us.
[09:01.240 --> 09:03.180]  I think everyone is going to have fun takes.
[09:03.260 --> 09:06.120]  It's just I think about Taylor Kitsch's career a lot.
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.160]  Guy I've never heard of in a bunch of movies and shows I've never seen.
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.480]  Deserves better.
[09:14.240 --> 09:16.640]  You tell me you're not a big Friday Night Lights head.
[09:17.200 --> 09:17.780]  Never seen it.
[09:17.780 --> 09:22.780]  You weren't into the Texas high school football team drama?
[09:23.080 --> 09:24.220]  I guess not. Crazy.
[09:24.340 --> 09:25.340]  I guess it never spoke to me.
[09:25.980 --> 09:26.460]  It was great.
[09:26.760 --> 09:28.000]  I'd highly recommend the show.
[09:28.080 --> 09:31.080]  There's an actor in the show that feels like he's not an actor
[09:31.080 --> 09:33.000]  and they just made a show around him.
[09:33.860 --> 09:34.980]  And he's wonderful.
[09:35.260 --> 09:37.080]  Highly recommend it just for his performance.
[09:37.260 --> 09:37.660]  Long, long.
[09:38.300 --> 09:40.740]  Not Taylor Kitsch, but he runs like a car dealership.
[09:40.920 --> 09:41.560]  And he's great.
[09:43.060 --> 09:44.600]  Taylor Kitsch also very good in the show.
[09:45.100 --> 09:45.960]  But that is my take.
[09:45.960 --> 09:49.180]  Taylor Kitsch deserves so much better than he got.
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.280]  And I'm happy to see that he's getting a little bit of a resurgence.
[09:52.480 --> 09:55.460]  I think Taylor Kitsch is exactly where he probably needs to be.
[09:55.620 --> 10:00.040]  I don't think that there's I I'm not clamoring for, dude,
[10:00.120 --> 10:02.880]  the other guy from the Savages to be in.
[10:03.540 --> 10:05.940]  Because you didn't get to see him in those roles.
[10:06.500 --> 10:07.580]  That's what I'd argue.
[10:07.900 --> 10:11.360]  I think he could be a dynamic, fun action star.
[10:11.540 --> 10:13.100]  And we just never got that.
[10:13.100 --> 10:19.800]  I think that if TV was still around, this guy would be Spike TV
[10:20.560 --> 10:23.300]  hero of whatever show is on Spike TV.
[10:23.580 --> 10:27.100]  Like this is a this is a cable actor.
[10:27.920 --> 10:29.620]  That is what this guy reads to me.
[10:30.020 --> 10:30.640]  I mean, that's fair.
[10:30.920 --> 10:33.060]  I mean, that's certainly where he's found his most success.
[10:33.400 --> 10:36.800]  Yeah, but he he he was gambit.
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.800]  He was gambit for four minutes.
[10:39.800 --> 10:41.260]  He was gambit.
[10:42.580 --> 10:44.040]  Four minutes of gambit.
[10:44.380 --> 10:45.940]  I guess I have seen him as gambit.
[10:46.460 --> 10:47.700]  Yeah. Yeah. And that's about it.
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.440]  And like, I feel like he's the only person from like this Deadpool Wolverine era
[10:52.440 --> 10:54.580]  that we're in where they're bringing everybody back.
[10:54.660 --> 10:55.840]  He's never going to get brought back.
[10:56.240 --> 10:58.720]  No. Well, did they bring back the guy who was the blob?
[10:59.080 --> 11:01.240]  No. What about Will.I.Am?
[11:01.340 --> 11:02.840]  Will.I.Am wasn't in anything else.
[11:03.340 --> 11:07.580]  No. Should your take be that Will.I.Am should be in more X-Men movies?
[11:08.820 --> 11:10.500]  No, I didn't think he was that good.
[11:11.320 --> 11:13.800]  Oh, but Taylor Kitsch was?
[11:14.220 --> 11:15.960]  Yeah, he was fine. He was he was solid.
[11:16.560 --> 11:19.660]  I think you should edit Taylor Kitsch's next reel.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.020]  Yeah. I think you should reach out and see if Taylor Kitsch has any hot takes
[11:25.020 --> 11:27.160]  he wants to give, because I bet you could get him.
[11:28.680 --> 11:30.020]  See what I can do.
[11:30.200 --> 11:32.420]  Maybe you can help him get on an Australian morning show.
[11:32.600 --> 11:35.560]  Yeah, he's nice.
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.900]  Just promoting our podcast.
[11:38.360 --> 11:41.720]  Yeah, dude. I think if it was based on how it worked with Gavin,
[11:41.800 --> 11:43.880]  he'd be promoting Friday Night Lights, the show.
[11:49.300 --> 11:50.440]  How did it all start?
[11:51.280 --> 11:52.300]  How'd you get into acting?
[11:54.020 --> 11:54.900]  Oh, man.
[11:55.900 --> 11:56.600]  Well, that's my take.
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.360]  Eric, what is your take if we're going in Discord order?
[12:01.080 --> 12:02.440]  Your take was so interesting.
[12:02.540 --> 12:05.860]  I don't find mine to be as interesting, but I feel kind of dumb.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.220]  Yeah, no, no, I don't. I definitely don't feel dumb.
[12:08.220 --> 12:10.460]  I definitely feel like, I don't know.
[12:10.580 --> 12:11.440]  We'll see how my takes.
[12:12.100 --> 12:13.420]  Yeah, I'm not sure I did this right.
[12:14.040 --> 12:16.160]  No, I'm so excited to get to Gavin's.
[12:16.160 --> 12:16.940]  I'm blown through mine.
[12:17.320 --> 12:20.880]  My take is that the take of
[12:20.880 --> 12:25.000]  there are too many podcasts is a hack take
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.320]  from people who would kill to have a podcast.
[12:29.720 --> 12:32.540]  Oh, you hear it all the time.
[12:32.800 --> 12:33.700]  There are too many podcasts.
[12:33.840 --> 12:36.400]  We should put tariffs on podcast equipment.
[12:37.100 --> 12:43.480]  It's a hack take from hack people who it's
[12:43.480 --> 12:44.700]  it's the low hanging fruit.
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.220]  It's the easy punching bag.
[12:46.680 --> 12:48.480]  Do I love how many podcasts there are?
[12:48.480 --> 12:52.100]  No. But the more podcasts that come out,
[12:52.160 --> 12:57.260]  the more listening hours are consumed monthly, month on month.
[12:57.380 --> 13:02.200]  Since podcasts have become a large source of entertainment.
[13:02.660 --> 13:06.100]  I don't think there are too many podcasts
[13:06.400 --> 13:10.740]  I don't think it should discourage anyone from starting a podcast.
[13:11.360 --> 13:16.500]  I think anyone with some ideas and everything can do this.
[13:16.880 --> 13:19.820]  I think that it's a lot easier to have the take online
[13:19.820 --> 13:22.760]  of there are too many podcasts than there are to try it yourself
[13:22.760 --> 13:23.940]  and see if you're successful.
[13:24.200 --> 13:26.080]  That's where that take comes from.
[13:26.360 --> 13:28.480]  And if you were to give those people microphones,
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.000]  they couldn't fucking wait to make three episodes and abandon it.
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.500]  That is the the the true way of podcasts is that
[13:37.220 --> 13:41.960]  I think just because they are so popular and trending in such a big way,
[13:42.020 --> 13:44.020]  it's just an easy thing to say.
[13:44.080 --> 13:48.940]  But nobody really, truly believes it, by and large.
[13:49.180 --> 13:51.080]  That is that's my take. Yeah.
[13:51.520 --> 13:52.920]  How many podcasts do you work on?
[13:53.340 --> 13:54.820]  I have right now.
[13:54.920 --> 13:58.660]  Well, Good Morning Gus is is is actually coming out right now.
[13:58.720 --> 14:01.760]  So there's one 100% E and there's this one.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.040]  Uh, we also have Creating Character, which you can check out.
[14:06.140 --> 14:08.040]  I didn't say promote them all. I'm just looking for a number here.
[14:08.280 --> 14:11.300]  Yeah. Oh, yeah, we can say four. I think four, four feels good.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.380]  Yeah. Interesting.
[14:14.140 --> 14:19.240]  Yeah, I agree with the take only because like, I think it's a weird situation
[14:19.240 --> 14:22.800]  in which sure, there are too many podcasts, but like, who cares?
[14:23.400 --> 14:25.880]  Like, there's also too much TV and too much radio.
[14:26.020 --> 14:28.460]  Yeah. It's all the time. Everything's on all the time.
[14:28.820 --> 14:31.680]  Yes. I think that the there's too many podcasts thing
[14:31.680 --> 14:35.380]  is just an easy thing to like tweet out and be like, that's right.
[14:35.720 --> 14:37.400]  I'm above this. And it's like, OK.
[14:37.540 --> 14:41.200]  I will say there are a lot of the same guy making the same podcast.
[14:41.420 --> 14:44.440]  There are. There are. There's also a lot of YouTube channels.
[14:44.920 --> 14:48.200]  And I think having the take in 2025 that there's too many YouTube
[14:48.200 --> 14:52.400]  channels is the same thing as there are too many podcasts.
[14:52.440 --> 14:55.540]  But that'll be in the next few years when the next sort of wave
[14:55.540 --> 14:58.360]  of whatever entertainment comes out.
[14:58.360 --> 15:02.280]  I don't think it's necessarily so groundbreaking
[15:02.280 --> 15:07.280]  or really correct that there are too many podcasts.
[15:07.540 --> 15:10.860]  I think that shouldn't discourage anyone from picking up a mic and giving it a try.
[15:11.260 --> 15:14.100]  That doesn't mean you're absolved from consequences of things.
[15:14.360 --> 15:17.200]  It just means that I don't think that there are too many.
[15:17.400 --> 15:19.360]  I think there's a lot more stories to be told out there
[15:20.020 --> 15:22.120]  that people could be doing or saying.
[15:22.260 --> 15:27.140]  I think three guys who just went to a like a bar and coming home
[15:27.140 --> 15:29.600]  and then they don't have anything to say, but then get on a mic.
[15:29.900 --> 15:31.600]  That's what people think a podcast is.
[15:31.760 --> 15:35.700]  But that's not necessarily what you get from a lot of this stuff.
[15:35.800 --> 15:36.840]  So that's my take.
[15:36.900 --> 15:38.700]  There are not actually too many podcasts.
[15:39.140 --> 15:42.180]  I think it's also a thing of like what you expect to get out of the podcast
[15:42.180 --> 15:43.160]  that you're making. Yeah.
[15:43.320 --> 15:46.760]  Like if you're let's say maybe there's a philosophical thing of like,
[15:46.860 --> 15:49.740]  I'm going to get into podcasting and make a ton of money.
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.060]  That is not an easy or like a realistic thing to expect.
[15:55.720 --> 15:59.760]  There are so many podcasts like just the I mean, that is like
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.460]  from a budgetary or like a marketing standpoint of ads and all that.
[16:03.620 --> 16:04.240]  Like, sure.
[16:04.780 --> 16:07.860]  But if you're just making a podcast because you want to do it
[16:07.860 --> 16:11.880]  and you think it would be fun, like it seems absurd to be like, no, no, no, no.
[16:12.180 --> 16:14.320]  Too many. You can't do it. Not allowed.
[16:14.660 --> 16:16.460]  That's how I feel about it. That's my take.
[16:16.780 --> 16:20.920]  I do respect the person that's making it also having that take, though,
[16:21.140 --> 16:23.620]  because I feel that way all of the time of like making a show
[16:23.620 --> 16:25.620]  and then being like, why the fuck am I doing this?
[16:25.660 --> 16:27.020]  I got nothing of interest to say.
[16:27.420 --> 16:28.440]  I don't this.
[16:29.180 --> 16:32.220]  More qualified people should be making these things.
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.440]  It is wild that I can just do this.
[16:34.600 --> 16:35.920]  But yeah, but anyone can.
[16:36.060 --> 16:39.920]  And I think that's what's I think that's what's cool about it is that anyone can.
[16:40.080 --> 16:41.020]  Oh, totally. Absolutely.
[16:41.140 --> 16:44.420]  It is very it is very like 2009 YouTube.
[16:44.820 --> 16:47.100]  Yes. To go out there and do it.
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.780]  I mean, without without podcasts, how would we know about Jack's exotic bird?
[16:51.380 --> 16:52.560]  That's such a good point.
[16:52.560 --> 16:56.560]  The world, you know, you all would just have to hoard that knowledge.
[16:56.860 --> 17:00.020]  Yeah. Yeah. We would have to do just like the 20 people at that party
[17:00.020 --> 17:03.940]  would know about Jack's exotic bird and not so, so, so many more.
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.000]  And I need as many people as possible to know about Jack's exotic bird.
[17:09.300 --> 17:10.740]  And that's the magic of podcasts.
[17:11.380 --> 17:11.920]  It really is.
[17:13.660 --> 17:15.940]  I'm so excited for when we record our next episode.
[17:16.060 --> 17:19.120]  I watched a movie and it opened up a whole new thing of lore for me
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.200]  that I'm very excited to share.
[17:20.280 --> 17:22.500]  Oh, it's fun. It's fun.
[17:22.500 --> 17:25.520]  Part of the joy of podcasting is you will do something for yourself
[17:25.520 --> 17:28.720]  and then it will create an opportunity to discuss something in a way
[17:28.720 --> 17:30.060]  you never anticipated. Yeah.
[17:30.520 --> 17:31.160]  Yeah. There you go.
[17:31.760 --> 17:35.380]  Well, Gavin, those are our first two takes.
[17:35.440 --> 17:36.820]  What about you? What takes do you have?
[17:37.140 --> 17:40.700]  If you manage to fit it in your asshole, you should be allowed to smuggle it.
[17:43.580 --> 17:46.060]  OK. So. Very interesting.
[17:46.420 --> 17:49.120]  But you've got to the trouble of putting it in your anus.
[17:49.640 --> 17:52.160]  Uh huh. It should just be anything goes in the anus.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.800]  Interesting. OK.
[17:53.980 --> 17:58.500]  So if I if I'm bringing in a bunch of drugs
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.920]  and they catch me, let's say, but it's in my anus,
[18:02.960 --> 18:07.140]  I'm no longer going to be penalized for attempting to smuggle drugs.
[18:07.500 --> 18:09.020]  Yeah. I mean, you put it in your own anus.
[18:09.200 --> 18:11.200]  You went through the trouble of that. They're yours.
[18:11.740 --> 18:15.200]  Is there a consideration, though, that putting something in an anus
[18:15.200 --> 18:18.020]  is maybe too easy to it be an immunity spot?
[18:18.720 --> 18:21.040]  Uh, it's sort of like a bag.
[18:21.040 --> 18:22.740]  I mean, you got a lot of runway there.
[18:22.840 --> 18:24.880]  You can lube it up like it depends on.
[18:25.120 --> 18:29.060]  I guess I guess what I'll say to that is that's a big talk
[18:29.060 --> 18:30.580]  from someone who's not doing it.
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.820]  Oh, I guess.
[18:34.840 --> 18:37.340]  I don't know. I just I feel like here's the thing.
[18:37.560 --> 18:40.260]  And this is going in a direction that I didn't anticipate going.
[18:40.740 --> 18:43.740]  I've had some pretty massive shits, which give me
[18:44.440 --> 18:47.660]  a concept of what's possible in there.
[18:47.700 --> 18:49.960]  I've never I'm not putting things in.
[18:49.960 --> 18:51.500]  I'm pushing stuff out.
[18:51.500 --> 18:53.240]  I just don't agree. I just don't agree.
[18:53.420 --> 18:58.600]  I feel like no, no, I feel like it doesn't deserve complete immunity.
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.860]  You feel like you you would have an advantage
[19:00.860 --> 19:03.120]  because you could smuggle a much bigger item than me.
[19:03.720 --> 19:06.480]  I don't think it's like I'm not bragging or anything.
[19:06.700 --> 19:10.360]  I'm not saying I have an abnormal like anus stretch ability.
[19:10.520 --> 19:13.840]  I'm not like fantastic for anally.
[19:14.540 --> 19:17.640]  But I do think that it might be.
[19:17.640 --> 19:19.580]  I don't know. It feels like it could be, too.
[19:20.100 --> 19:22.420]  I don't know. It's an interesting take.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.340]  What were you thinking of smuggling?
[19:25.020 --> 19:28.100]  Uh, I just there's a lot of people getting their anuses looked at
[19:28.100 --> 19:29.400]  by other people, isn't it?
[19:29.400 --> 19:32.260]  Sure. Getting stuff taken from their own anus.
[19:34.020 --> 19:37.340]  I just feel like that should be a safe space for people.
[19:37.480 --> 19:39.520]  You can't you can't smuggle a lot.
[19:39.640 --> 19:43.000]  It's not like you could smuggle a boatload of heroin.
[19:43.260 --> 19:44.240]  Just enough for you.
[19:45.560 --> 19:47.860]  I think you'd be surprised how much heroin.
[19:48.100 --> 19:50.440]  Yeah, I don't know. I think it would be a lot.
[19:50.540 --> 19:53.220]  I think it'd be like a lot more than you think it would be in that case.
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.740]  Let's say then that it's only for the stuff that went up.
[19:55.820 --> 19:56.980]  It's not for the stuff you swallowed.
[19:57.640 --> 20:00.700]  What? I didn't even think about what you're saying.
[20:00.800 --> 20:02.460]  But like, I assume that was a rule.
[20:03.100 --> 20:07.340]  I assume it has to be the entry point of anal as opposed to swallowing.
[20:07.640 --> 20:10.820]  Yeah, because you can swallow a lot more than you can put up.
[20:11.380 --> 20:14.740]  At that point, your take would just be anything inside of you is fair game.
[20:15.180 --> 20:16.140]  What are you?
[20:16.360 --> 20:20.080]  I'm confused. I'm confused about what could be swallowed that you would smuggle.
[20:20.520 --> 20:24.000]  Heroin. Well, no, because I think your stomach would definitely break that down
[20:24.000 --> 20:24.820]  and you would die.
[20:25.080 --> 20:26.700]  Yeah, you don't swallow the raw heroin.
[20:26.840 --> 20:28.280]  You would put it in a Johnny, wouldn't you?
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.820]  Right. But even even still, you don't think like the risk of swallowing.
[20:32.900 --> 20:34.560]  I just don't think it would pass through you.
[20:34.860 --> 20:36.960]  That was a movie thing, wasn't it?
[20:36.960 --> 20:39.860]  We're like, I think there was a thing where like,
[20:40.140 --> 20:42.380]  I've definitely seen a thing where someone swallowed a bunch of heroin
[20:42.380 --> 20:44.320]  and one of the bags burst that.
[20:44.720 --> 20:49.140]  Yeah, I mean, it's that is that in like, I just feel like the risk of swallowing it
[20:49.140 --> 20:52.920]  and it bursting his way is so much higher than just sticking it up.
[20:53.040 --> 20:55.800]  I because I agree. I think if you swallow it, no fair game.
[20:55.840 --> 20:57.400]  But if you put it up, fair game.
[20:57.860 --> 20:58.940]  I wouldn't be using it for drugs, though.
[20:58.960 --> 21:01.460]  I'd be using it just to avoid like importing something.
[21:02.140 --> 21:04.320]  But like what? Like what? Yeah.
[21:04.320 --> 21:06.120]  Um, I don't know.
[21:06.240 --> 21:08.460]  Like it was like a small but high value item.
[21:08.580 --> 21:09.680]  I don't know, man.
[21:09.780 --> 21:13.900]  It's like if I had a if I had a fancy ring or something, I'd put it in my ass
[21:13.900 --> 21:15.240]  and then I wouldn't have.
[21:15.780 --> 21:19.900]  Yeah, like say I went to a place where the ring was cheaper to buy.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.060]  I'd buy it, pop it in my ass and travel back with it.
[21:23.280 --> 21:25.060]  You just couldn't just wear it.
[21:25.420 --> 21:26.340]  That's a bad example.
[21:30.200 --> 21:33.240]  Are you just are you just trying to put stuff?
[21:33.240 --> 21:34.320]  What are you talking about?
[21:34.400 --> 21:36.440]  What about Christopher Walken did it?
[21:36.780 --> 21:38.180]  Yeah, Christopher Walken did do it.
[21:38.420 --> 21:39.480]  You put a watch in his ass?
[21:40.000 --> 21:41.100]  Yeah. In Pulp Fiction.
[21:41.600 --> 21:43.780]  Oh, the whole monologue. Yeah.
[21:44.540 --> 21:45.920]  Oh, yeah. What about this?
[21:46.040 --> 21:47.400]  What if it's OK?
[21:47.520 --> 21:51.240]  So let's say you smuggle something legally through your ass.
[21:51.440 --> 21:55.580]  OK, then you pop it out of your ass and commit a crime with it.
[21:55.620 --> 21:58.580]  Is that crime also legal or is no, no, no.
[21:58.580 --> 21:59.900]  It's not like a golden bullet.
[22:00.200 --> 22:01.440]  It's not a golden bullet situation.
[22:01.440 --> 22:05.460]  It's just what you know, what made me think of it was, you know, in Left 4 Dead,
[22:05.520 --> 22:08.740]  you've got like the safe houses where zombies just can't affect you.
[22:08.900 --> 22:10.200]  You're it's your moment to chill.
[22:10.340 --> 22:11.400]  It's your safe space.
[22:11.500 --> 22:14.480]  You're guaranteed that nothing bad is going to happen until you open the door.
[22:15.140 --> 22:16.860]  I just want a real life safe space.
[22:16.860 --> 22:21.300]  And what better space than my natural God given pocket?
[22:21.640 --> 22:24.540]  But I keep I keep wondering, like, what do you like?
[22:24.960 --> 22:26.900]  What do you mean about having stuff up?
[22:26.980 --> 22:28.960]  Like, what is your example of stuff?
[22:29.460 --> 22:30.020]  Lump of gold.
[22:31.520 --> 22:32.820]  OK, but why is it?
[22:33.620 --> 22:36.140]  But why do you have to do that?
[22:36.160 --> 22:37.180]  I guess is my question.
[22:37.620 --> 22:38.580]  Like, I don't know.
[22:38.620 --> 22:40.400]  I just wanted a place that no one would ever look.
[22:41.460 --> 22:42.440]  But they do look.
[22:42.800 --> 22:45.360]  Yeah, that's what I said. That's my point. They shouldn't.
[22:45.420 --> 22:47.040]  Do they have to manually look still?
[22:47.120 --> 22:49.960]  I feel like we should be at a point with technology that they could just tell
[22:49.960 --> 22:51.140]  if you have something in your ass.
[22:51.600 --> 22:55.480]  I like the idea of getting put in the in the x-ray and they can see the watch.
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.780]  You know, they're like, well, you little rascal, you put it in your ass.
[22:57.860 --> 22:59.200]  Go on. Get out of here, you.
[22:59.200 --> 23:00.780]  Yep. Yeah.
[23:01.100 --> 23:02.400]  With their watch. Yep.
[23:05.220 --> 23:07.900]  Now, OK, let's just expand on this for you personally.
[23:08.440 --> 23:10.920]  Yeah, let's say that this was a socially acceptable thing.
[23:10.980 --> 23:13.380]  What do you think you would just carry in it whenever you went out?
[23:13.440 --> 23:15.160]  Would it be something you regularly used?
[23:15.660 --> 23:18.000]  Um, I'm trying to think nothing.
[23:18.120 --> 23:18.780]  I've never like.
[23:19.220 --> 23:23.100]  I've just always been scared of moving stuff between countries that I own
[23:23.100 --> 23:25.580]  because I'm like, oh, they're going to like think I've bought that
[23:25.580 --> 23:27.200]  and I'm illegally importing it.
[23:27.200 --> 23:29.780]  And I just want the security of my ass.
[23:29.960 --> 23:32.820]  But I can't or I also couldn't fit like an Xbox in my ass and stuff.
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.240]  Yeah, that would be a problem.
[23:34.320 --> 23:37.380]  That would have to be several flights and piece by piece.
[23:37.820 --> 23:39.900]  I like this take because it's truly insane.
[23:40.200 --> 23:43.760]  And I keep asking for examples and I don't feel like I'm getting any.
[23:43.920 --> 23:45.560]  So I'm really on board for this.
[23:45.800 --> 23:46.200]  I'll be honest.
[23:46.240 --> 23:49.480]  I can't think of a single item that I would actually use this on.
[23:49.580 --> 23:52.700]  I just think people who put stuff up their ass to go through
[23:54.240 --> 23:56.480]  to go through passport checks and stuff,
[23:56.480 --> 23:59.320]  they've gone through a lot and a lot of effort involved.
[23:59.540 --> 24:03.260]  It just it feels like the worst surprise you could have.
[24:03.760 --> 24:08.400]  Yeah. Like if we went out on a picnic and I was like, oh, man, I forgot.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.680]  I forgot to bring dessert.
[24:09.900 --> 24:12.480]  And you're like, don't worry, I got some cookies right here.
[24:12.540 --> 24:13.360]  Just give me a second.
[24:14.320 --> 24:16.080]  Why would he do that with cookies?
[24:16.460 --> 24:20.040]  I was just thinking like a bag of cookies, like a mini bag.
[24:20.120 --> 24:22.800]  Right, right. Why would he do that with cookies?
[24:23.080 --> 24:25.080]  Why is he storing anything in his anus?
[24:25.080 --> 24:29.380]  Because it seems like it's illegal to get getting this from country to country.
[24:29.500 --> 24:30.560]  He started arguing.
[24:30.980 --> 24:32.520]  You're talking about using it.
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.700]  But he's saying a safe place where people won't go.
[24:35.760 --> 24:38.560]  That makes sense for maybe potentially illegal activities.
[24:38.860 --> 24:43.880]  What you're saying is we go on a picnic and he pulls Oreos out of his ass.
[24:44.580 --> 24:48.920]  He did mention that he just wants to use his God given pouch or whatever.
[24:49.080 --> 24:50.540]  I don't know what that wording was, but
[24:52.580 --> 24:53.940]  I don't know what he said,
[24:53.940 --> 24:56.340]  but it was something about he wanted to use his anal pouch.
[24:57.020 --> 25:01.020]  So at the point in which he just wants to use it, then I think you have to like
[25:01.020 --> 25:03.120]  it becomes a day to day thing for him.
[25:03.360 --> 25:06.920]  Does it? Gavin, does it feel like it becomes a day to day thing to you?
[25:06.940 --> 25:09.200]  No, I don't need to use it every day. I'd hardly ever use it.
[25:10.300 --> 25:12.900]  This feels like a really weird thing to fight for, then,
[25:12.940 --> 25:14.380]  if it's something you don't want to really use.
[25:14.380 --> 25:16.200]  OK, OK, what about this? What about this, right?
[25:16.600 --> 25:19.600]  OK. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping.
[25:21.380 --> 25:23.760]  Get some of those melatonin gummies.
[25:23.940 --> 25:25.980]  Right. To help me sleep.
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.200]  But I don't think you're allowed to bring those to England.
[25:30.700 --> 25:33.880]  So whenever I come to England, I'm like insomnia and stuff.
[25:34.040 --> 25:37.180]  If I just pulled a week's worth of gummies out of my ass, fine.
[25:37.700 --> 25:39.100]  I also don't know if they're checking for those.
[25:39.260 --> 25:41.220]  I have no idea if they'd actually confiscate that.
[25:41.240 --> 25:44.840]  Now that that's the world I want to live in, is that you're smuggling things
[25:44.840 --> 25:47.900]  anally that you don't have to, but just assume aren't allowed.
[25:48.160 --> 25:50.340]  I like that reality a lot.
[25:50.340 --> 25:53.120]  Can I bring melatonin from the U.S.
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.480]  to the U.K.? Not finding a clear answer.
[25:55.940 --> 25:58.960]  First comment, it's not illegal to bring in.
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.800]  It's just illegal for someone to sell to you in the U.K.
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.560]  without a prescription.
[26:03.240 --> 26:05.660]  OK, second comment. Yes, you can bring it.
[26:06.740 --> 26:07.780]  Third comment.
[26:08.300 --> 26:11.900]  You can order melatonin over the Internet into the U.K.
[26:11.960 --> 26:13.260]  from the U.S.
[26:13.520 --> 26:16.580]  I bring a tub home every time I go.
[26:18.540 --> 26:21.980]  Now imagine how embarrassing it is if he's huddled over a toilet
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.420]  while reading this, trying to get his melatonin.
[26:25.580 --> 26:28.720]  Wow. Here's the thing, I think I like your take.
[26:28.820 --> 26:31.460]  I don't think I like any of your uses for the take.
[26:31.580 --> 26:32.300]  I think that's the thing.
[26:32.380 --> 26:37.520]  I like the idea of my take, but I've not only do I not know what I put in my ass.
[26:37.620 --> 26:41.180]  I've never experienced putting anything in my ass, apart from the occasional
[26:41.180 --> 26:42.740]  woman's finger. Sure.
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.220]  You've never had like a... what's the word I'm looking for?
[26:46.220 --> 26:48.060]  They they put the tube in your ass.
[26:49.000 --> 26:49.800]  Medical procedure.
[26:50.300 --> 26:51.020]  Like a colonoscopy?
[26:51.960 --> 26:52.760]  Thank you.
[26:52.780 --> 26:53.120]  Like an enema?
[26:53.120 --> 26:54.880]  You've never had one of those or like an enema?
[26:55.380 --> 26:58.180]  No, no, no, just a finger.
[26:59.920 --> 27:04.020]  Just a just a surprising finger.
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.480]  I I'm going to be thinking about your take all day again.
[27:12.900 --> 27:14.940]  It's all I'm going to be thinking about for the rest of this.
[27:15.020 --> 27:15.820]  Look, I told you.
[27:15.820 --> 27:16.820]  I thought I've done this wrong.
[27:16.820 --> 27:18.080]  So I don't know why you didn't.
[27:18.740 --> 27:20.080]  I don't think you did it wrong.
[27:20.200 --> 27:21.780]  No, I don't think you did it wrong at all.
[27:21.920 --> 27:23.960]  I really, truly don't think you did it wrong.
[27:24.240 --> 27:24.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[27:26.620 --> 27:29.980]  I don't think I've ever heard Nick so confused in the background.
[27:30.640 --> 27:31.620]  It's very exciting.
[27:31.820 --> 27:32.760]  I'm just I'm thrilled.
[27:33.600 --> 27:35.420]  I'm thrilled about this.
[27:35.660 --> 27:36.920]  So great.
[27:38.200 --> 27:39.860]  But that's Gavin's take.
[27:39.960 --> 27:40.960]  That's pretty exciting.
[27:41.420 --> 27:43.840]  Nick, we have your very first take.
[27:44.760 --> 27:48.260]  I feel that what an act to follow.
[27:49.560 --> 27:52.260]  I feel that I'm going to take some heat for this.
[27:52.660 --> 27:55.660]  Oh, in fact, I know I'm going to take heat for this because I believe
[27:55.660 --> 27:57.400]  I am very much in the minority on this.
[27:58.700 --> 28:04.760]  I would like to say that the inverted control scheme is the correct.
[28:05.040 --> 28:06.320]  You're insane. You're an idiot.
[28:06.580 --> 28:08.380]  I think we talked about this.
[28:08.760 --> 28:09.560]  You're nuts.
[28:09.760 --> 28:13.380]  Like, I like made a comment about something we played recently.
[28:13.380 --> 28:16.120]  And saw that you did like inverted controls and thought you were crazy.
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.220]  So does that mean, Nick, that when you get in a vehicle, like a plane
[28:19.220 --> 28:22.820]  in a video game or a banshee or something, are you now not inverted?
[28:22.900 --> 28:24.120]  Are you inverted on both?
[28:24.340 --> 28:24.900]  Inverted on both.
[28:24.960 --> 28:25.880]  It makes no sense.
[28:26.240 --> 28:26.860]  What do you mean?
[28:27.060 --> 28:29.620]  I think I mean, think about how your head moves.
[28:29.640 --> 28:30.660]  Yeah, I move my head.
[28:31.200 --> 28:33.240]  It's moved by my neck up and down.
[28:33.280 --> 28:35.400]  It's not it's not flown like a plane.
[28:35.440 --> 28:38.580]  No one's steering my head with a stick through the back of my head.
[28:38.700 --> 28:40.660]  Tilt your head to look up.
[28:40.720 --> 28:42.100]  You're tilting your head backward,
[28:42.100 --> 28:44.620]  which is the way that you're doing it on the controller.
[28:45.160 --> 28:47.440]  Yeah, but there's no stick coming out the back of my head.
[28:47.500 --> 28:50.440]  No one's got their thumb on a stick on the back of my head.
[28:50.800 --> 28:51.860]  Fine, fine, Gavin.
[28:51.960 --> 28:53.060]  Let's look at it from your perspective.
[28:53.120 --> 28:56.160]  Let's talk about operating a camera.
[28:56.380 --> 28:59.840]  When you tilt to look up, which way do you pull the camera?
[29:00.460 --> 29:04.660]  If I tilt to look up, I push down on the stick
[29:04.660 --> 29:07.100]  because it's a stick coming out the back.
[29:07.400 --> 29:08.400]  You pull it back.
[29:08.520 --> 29:10.140]  But if the camera was on my head,
[29:10.140 --> 29:11.120]  you would look up.
[29:11.120 --> 29:12.380]  You're still tilting your head back.
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.180]  I would look up to look up.
[29:14.320 --> 29:15.700]  You would look up to look up.
[29:16.400 --> 29:18.400]  You're tilting back to look up.
[29:18.900 --> 29:20.640]  You're tilting forward to look down.
[29:20.980 --> 29:23.000]  You don't look back or forwards.
[29:23.060 --> 29:24.160]  You look up and down.
[29:24.500 --> 29:27.040]  So so you so you invert up and down.
[29:27.340 --> 29:28.480]  Do you invert left and right?
[29:28.960 --> 29:30.120]  No, God, no, that's wrong.
[29:30.200 --> 29:32.900]  Right. But you're steering your head to the right.
[29:32.980 --> 29:34.580]  I don't understand what the fuck you're saying then.
[29:35.200 --> 29:37.220]  OK, so, Nick, I've got a camera, right?
[29:37.300 --> 29:38.900]  I want the camera to look to the right.
[29:38.900 --> 29:43.240]  I take the stick coming off the back of the camera and I move in which direction?
[29:43.860 --> 29:44.760]  I turn the camera right.
[29:44.880 --> 29:46.520]  You turn the camera right by doing what?
[29:47.540 --> 29:48.340]  By turning it right.
[29:48.420 --> 29:50.420]  Yeah, by pushing the stick to the left, huh?
[29:50.700 --> 29:52.300]  If you invert, you're up and down.
[29:53.000 --> 29:54.660]  You should be inverting your left and right.
[29:55.100 --> 29:56.220]  That's absolutely true.
[29:56.860 --> 29:58.700]  That's now that's a take right there.
[29:58.960 --> 30:00.860]  That is a take. I will say this.
[30:01.400 --> 30:01.660]  Touche.
[30:04.900 --> 30:08.000]  But also now I'm just going to go back to the flying one.
[30:08.520 --> 30:12.120]  You go left, you turn lefty, you go lefty, you turn righty, you go righty.
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.200]  You pull back to go up.
[30:13.340 --> 30:17.140]  You go, you push down, go down, or push forward, go down.
[30:17.700 --> 30:19.900]  So I'm going to stick with the flight controls.
[30:20.120 --> 30:23.260]  Inverted is correct, but only on the Y axis.
[30:25.240 --> 30:27.380]  So how did you become inverted?
[30:28.000 --> 30:30.380]  Halo. It's it's literally thanks to Halo.
[30:30.560 --> 30:32.760]  Yeah, but Halo isn't by default inverted.
[30:33.260 --> 30:35.400]  It's not. But I remember.
[30:36.100 --> 30:37.540]  No, but listen, but listen, but listen.
[30:37.540 --> 30:39.860]  They do that whole tutorial bit at the beginning.
[30:40.040 --> 30:43.520]  Chief comes out of cryo sleep and they have you do the control thing.
[30:43.620 --> 30:45.240]  Like, look left, look right, look up, look down.
[30:45.400 --> 30:48.640]  And then I remember being like, well, try this up and down.
[30:48.700 --> 30:52.460]  And I in the moment I was like, I don't feel anything different.
[30:52.460 --> 30:54.780]  So I just went with whatever the second was.
[30:55.960 --> 30:59.300]  And ever since then, inverted is the way to be.
[30:59.360 --> 31:01.220]  So why are you blaming Halo then?
[31:01.620 --> 31:03.080]  Did you only play Halo? Because it gave me the option?
[31:04.900 --> 31:06.080]  Like, I'm trying to understand.
[31:06.080 --> 31:09.720]  Like, I get like Halo playing that way, but then you go to a different game
[31:10.280 --> 31:12.620]  and then you have to go into the settings and change it.
[31:12.900 --> 31:14.980]  Yeah, well, I mean, at that point, it was so ingrained
[31:14.980 --> 31:17.920]  because I played a lot of Halo that it was just everything else
[31:17.920 --> 31:19.180]  made me feel sick and slow.
[31:19.420 --> 31:22.080]  Did you not play like a first person shooter prior to Halo?
[31:22.560 --> 31:23.880]  And there weren't there weren't a ton, though.
[31:24.500 --> 31:26.060]  Well, there are so many like Doom.
[31:26.500 --> 31:28.540]  On a controller? Quake? On a controller?
[31:29.740 --> 31:30.140]  GoldenEye?
[31:30.940 --> 31:32.340]  I mean, but GoldenEye was.
[31:32.460 --> 31:33.620]  I think GoldenEye was inverted.
[31:34.260 --> 31:35.740]  I mean, you didn't look up or down.
[31:35.740 --> 31:36.600]  Unless you stopped.
[31:36.940 --> 31:37.460]  Unless you were aiming.
[31:38.320 --> 31:39.960]  I guess, yeah. Right.
[31:40.120 --> 31:41.020]  So you looked up and down.
[31:41.020 --> 31:42.620]  No, I mean, unless you were going through the crosshairs.
[31:42.700 --> 31:43.740]  Most of the time you can just shoot.
[31:43.860 --> 31:45.380]  Right. So you would look up and down.
[31:46.500 --> 31:48.580]  I would I would not look up and down that much in GoldenEye.
[31:48.580 --> 31:49.840]  I would never look up and down. Me neither.
[31:50.080 --> 31:51.420]  I'm not saying that I did it.
[31:51.500 --> 31:53.580]  I'm saying that it was there and you could do it.
[31:53.640 --> 31:54.460]  I mean, yeah, now.
[31:55.100 --> 31:56.360]  What does that mean?
[31:58.700 --> 31:59.220]  What do you mean?
[31:59.220 --> 32:01.420]  So is your is your take
[32:02.080 --> 32:05.000]  that every game should be inverted by default?
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.140]  Yeah. And I think that people should give it a shot because it is better.
[32:09.400 --> 32:10.200]  It's more comfortable.
[32:10.340 --> 32:10.900]  Why would everyone
[32:11.860 --> 32:16.000]  inverted? The word inverted basically just means like backwards or flipped.
[32:16.300 --> 32:17.680]  It's like it's not the default.
[32:17.920 --> 32:20.020]  It says there's no verted.
[32:20.140 --> 32:22.600]  There's normal and inverted.
[32:24.840 --> 32:27.620]  Hey, you guys playing this inverted or verted?
[32:27.780 --> 32:29.000]  Oh, these controls are verted.
[32:29.100 --> 32:32.020]  As someone who plays everything verted and then I swap controls
[32:32.020 --> 32:34.860]  with someone who doesn't, I'm just like, all it does for you, Nick.
[32:34.860 --> 32:37.880]  Surely it's cause arguments from verted people.
[32:39.820 --> 32:41.640]  Well, yes, it does.
[32:41.800 --> 32:47.520]  And that's why I decided to be brave and tell my story about how brave my life.
[32:47.620 --> 32:48.320]  Well, let me ask you this.
[32:48.640 --> 32:50.520]  All these verts coming for you.
[32:50.640 --> 32:55.040]  Are you going to pass down this hindrance to your child?
[32:55.600 --> 32:57.140]  That's exactly what I wanted to know.
[32:58.020 --> 32:58.980]  Interesting question.
[32:59.800 --> 33:02.740]  Is he is he going to get a choice in this or are you just going to start
[33:02.740 --> 33:05.220]  feeding them inverted controls without him knowing?
[33:05.540 --> 33:08.640]  You know, I wouldn't have to switch the control scheme
[33:08.640 --> 33:10.100]  when we handed the controller off.
[33:10.460 --> 33:11.980]  Yeah, he's going to learn inverted.
[33:13.260 --> 33:14.460]  He's flying right.
[33:15.040 --> 33:17.120]  Yeah. Wait, that sounded wrong. He's flying true.
[33:17.220 --> 33:19.680]  But right, but right is left, right is right.
[33:20.680 --> 33:22.400]  No, y-axis.
[33:24.460 --> 33:27.400]  This take is, I can't wait for the verts to come after you.
[33:27.460 --> 33:29.580]  I thought I thought Gavin's take was going to get slammed.
[33:29.700 --> 33:31.300]  I definitely think Nick's take is going to get slammed.
[33:31.300 --> 33:34.420]  Well, Gavin emboldened me, to be wrong.
[33:34.780 --> 33:37.320]  Yeah, I know. I played GTA with both of you.
[33:37.400 --> 33:38.580]  I've seen how it works.
[33:39.400 --> 33:43.480]  We should film a Let's Play at some point where Nick has to play
[33:43.480 --> 33:45.660]  verted and the rest of us all have to do inverted.
[33:45.820 --> 33:47.700]  That is such a good idea.
[33:47.880 --> 33:50.560]  I mean, I don't want to do it, but that would be terrible.
[33:50.900 --> 33:56.160]  But I think it would be easier for the verteds to use inverted
[33:56.160 --> 33:58.220]  because we fly planes inverted in games.
[33:58.380 --> 33:59.540]  Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[33:59.540 --> 34:00.220]  But you don't fly shit.
[34:00.220 --> 34:01.540]  It's a very interesting take, yeah.
[34:02.800 --> 34:03.800]  Backwards, or normally.
[34:04.680 --> 34:05.260]  Very curious.
[34:05.760 --> 34:07.760]  Well, Nick, great take.
[34:08.480 --> 34:10.760]  I think we could do one more take each.
[34:11.240 --> 34:13.460]  You think one more take each or do you think we wrap up at like-
[34:13.460 --> 34:15.260]  No, no, we got to do one more take each.
[34:15.320 --> 34:17.180]  I'm so curious to see what else Gavin has to say.
[34:17.840 --> 34:18.480]  That's fair.
[34:18.560 --> 34:20.940]  Do you have another take, Gavin, or do you only have one take?
[34:21.260 --> 34:22.140]  Oh, I wrote like 10.
[34:22.240 --> 34:23.060]  I thought this was going to be-
[34:23.060 --> 34:23.820]  Oh, that's radical.
[34:24.040 --> 34:25.920]  All right, then let's go back around the horn.
[34:26.100 --> 34:29.000]  Let's start with Andrew and then let's go back around the horn.
[34:29.540 --> 34:30.300]  My second take?
[34:30.760 --> 34:33.220]  We get one real animal movie a year.
[34:33.520 --> 34:37.560]  I know making movies with real animals isn't ethical.
[34:38.180 --> 34:43.720]  So we use CG animals now almost all the time, but it just doesn't hit the same.
[34:44.000 --> 34:45.000]  It's not as fun.
[34:45.300 --> 34:46.380]  It's not as entertaining.
[34:46.880 --> 34:53.740]  I think we should be allowed morally to have one film a year that is real animals in all of the roles.
[34:53.780 --> 34:57.040]  And it's like the big real animal movie of the summer or year.
[34:57.400 --> 34:58.420]  That is my take.
[34:58.420 --> 35:01.720]  I really have almost truly no opinion on this.
[35:02.680 --> 35:06.400]  Who's the board that decides, oh, this is the movie that gets the real animal?
[35:07.200 --> 35:07.900]  Oh, good question.
[35:08.600 --> 35:12.400]  I, you know, I think maybe it rotates by major studio each year.
[35:12.520 --> 35:22.340]  A major studio has the, I don't know if you want to say right or like they've been penalized with making a fully real animal movie and it just rotates.
[35:22.800 --> 35:28.400]  But there's only one and there's a lot of expectation on that movie delivering because of that.
[35:28.400 --> 35:30.240]  Because I'm sick of the CG.
[35:30.340 --> 35:36.960]  I saw a trailer for Cats vs. Dogs 3 recently, which I didn't know was a thing they made a third of.
[35:37.160 --> 35:39.080]  And they're all CG and it looks like shit.
[35:39.360 --> 35:40.840]  That's just now they look like shit.
[35:41.260 --> 35:41.520]  What do you mean?
[35:41.680 --> 35:44.500]  Surely eventually, 20 years from now, you won't be able to tell.
[35:44.800 --> 35:45.640]  I don't think that's true.
[35:45.720 --> 35:46.920]  I think he doesn't want to wait.
[35:47.320 --> 35:48.640]  He doesn't want to wait the 20 years, though.
[35:48.700 --> 35:49.460]  I don't want to wait.
[35:49.640 --> 35:51.500]  He wants a real cat and a real dog doing something.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.980]  And I also, yeah, I want to know that it's a real dog playing football.
[35:55.380 --> 35:57.380]  I want a real dog running out there getting that ball.
[35:58.220 --> 36:07.640]  Dude, if the end of Homeward Bound was CG dogs and a cat walking back home, it would not be as impactful.
[36:08.100 --> 36:09.460]  So maybe I agree with this.
[36:10.460 --> 36:12.960]  Oh, I think it just doesn't hit the same.
[36:13.320 --> 36:15.260]  Do you want the animal to be doing its own stunts as well?
[36:15.340 --> 36:16.640]  Or are you okay with a CG double?
[36:17.000 --> 36:18.740]  No, I want to do the stunts.
[36:18.760 --> 36:21.000]  All right, well, this might be where we...
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.700]  This is where it becomes unethical.
[36:22.700 --> 36:28.200]  Like, say a dog, a dog has to escape a burning building from a... with a zipline.
[36:29.360 --> 36:30.180]  How are you doing that?
[36:30.600 --> 36:32.520]  I don't know. I'm not a fucking stunt coordinator.
[36:33.120 --> 36:36.040]  How does Tom Cruise stand on an airplane wing?
[36:36.600 --> 36:40.100]  There are people that are professionals that figure out how to film that.
[36:40.420 --> 36:41.900]  Fucking now what, Gavin?
[36:42.360 --> 36:43.360]  Yeah, get him, get him.
[36:43.480 --> 36:45.600]  You're asking me how do I set up a safe stunt?
[36:45.780 --> 36:46.560]  I don't do that.
[36:46.620 --> 36:49.560]  But there's an industry of people that that's their job.
[36:49.640 --> 36:50.720]  I will trust them.
[36:50.720 --> 36:53.120]  Gavin, take that and shove it up your anus.
[36:53.300 --> 36:57.080]  He doesn't give a fuck about how it's done.
[36:57.280 --> 36:58.920]  He just wants to watch the end result.
[37:00.200 --> 37:02.380]  Here's the thing. I want it to be done safely.
[37:02.720 --> 37:05.760]  How is it done safely? I don't fucking know. That's not my job.
[37:05.920 --> 37:07.300]  I don't live in that world.
[37:08.040 --> 37:09.840]  But there are professionals that do.
[37:11.480 --> 37:13.700]  And I trust that they will figure it out.
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.720]  Oh my god.
[37:17.820 --> 37:18.420]  Well, that took a turn.
[37:18.440 --> 37:20.260]  I just want a real animal movie.
[37:20.380 --> 37:22.100]  Because it's... they all suck now.
[37:22.100 --> 37:23.300]  Just watch Planet Earth.
[37:23.740 --> 37:25.500]  They're not, like, doing goofy stuff.
[37:25.880 --> 37:29.220]  You're not going to see Bingo on trial on Planet Earth.
[37:29.720 --> 37:30.640]  Bingo on trial?
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.400]  Remember the Bingo movie? Something we should watch?
[37:33.880 --> 37:34.100]  Mm-hmm.
[37:34.420 --> 37:35.440]  He's on the stand.
[37:35.940 --> 37:42.100]  Now, are you okay with the fact that the animal is probably going to get uncomfortable and hurt while it's filming?
[37:42.520 --> 37:48.220]  That's the thing. That's why it's morally unethical and why we stopped doing this as a culture.
[37:49.340 --> 37:52.720]  But I think we can be allowed one per year.
[37:52.840 --> 37:55.760]  Did we stop doing it? There's still animals in films.
[37:56.540 --> 37:58.580]  Not really. Like, not in the way it used to be.
[37:58.800 --> 38:06.100]  He wants full animal film. Like, he doesn't want, like, here's a section about animal. He wants, like, full on.
[38:06.120 --> 38:08.380]  But not, like, these people are riding a horse sort of thing.
[38:09.320 --> 38:13.620]  Right. If the movie was about the horse all the way, then absolutely.
[38:14.260 --> 38:16.640]  I want MVP4 with a real monkey.
[38:17.100 --> 38:17.900]  That's all I want.
[38:18.340 --> 38:18.560]  Hmm.
[38:18.820 --> 38:20.220]  I don't feel like it's a huge ask.
[38:20.520 --> 38:20.760]  Hmm.
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.200]  But I understand it's unethical.
[38:22.440 --> 38:27.200]  When I emailed that zoo where Louis from MVP is currently residing,
[38:27.380 --> 38:32.100]  they were very clear that they do not support the MVP movies or animals in film in general.
[38:32.260 --> 38:34.480]  I get it. I support it.
[38:34.900 --> 38:36.380]  But just, we could do one.
[38:36.580 --> 38:40.380]  We could do one per year and make sure it's really safe and everything's all good.
[38:40.960 --> 38:41.720]  We could do one.
[38:41.720 --> 38:42.620]  I support it.
[38:42.860 --> 38:43.680]  And that's my take.
[38:43.680 --> 38:47.020]  One real animal movie per year should be allowed.
[38:48.580 --> 38:50.740]  Well, there you go.
[38:51.320 --> 38:51.960]  That's it.
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.040]  Eric, what's your take?
[38:53.460 --> 38:53.720]  Wow.
[38:54.720 --> 39:03.040]  My take is one that in my lifetime, I think, it was something that we wanted and then got,
[39:03.280 --> 39:08.020]  but too much of a good thing has become sort of what this thing is.
[39:08.480 --> 39:08.680]  Hmm.
[39:08.680 --> 39:13.380]  I think, my hot take, is not everything needs lore.
[39:14.160 --> 39:14.300]  Oh!
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.380]  At one point in movies, a movie would just be a movie,
[39:18.580 --> 39:21.040]  and we didn't have to know everything about every character.
[39:21.240 --> 39:23.500]  We didn't have to have backstories about every single thing.
[39:23.600 --> 39:24.780]  Not everything was a big franchise.
[39:25.520 --> 39:27.420]  Sometimes a movie was just a movie.
[39:27.740 --> 39:29.340]  Sometimes a TV show was just a TV show.
[39:29.500 --> 39:35.840]  And sometimes we didn't need the alternate reality game that nobody really cared about
[39:35.840 --> 39:40.180]  to put all these pieces together to solve a mystery that nobody wants
[39:40.180 --> 39:41.920]  for a show that's canceled in season two.
[39:42.100 --> 39:45.880]  But how would characters, how would a movie exist without lore?
[39:46.300 --> 39:46.860]  No, no, no.
[39:46.940 --> 39:51.280]  I'm not talking about the, what you're seeing on screen.
[39:51.420 --> 39:55.440]  I'm talking about what happens when everyone extrapolates every little detail
[39:55.440 --> 39:58.540]  in becoming the most lore-focused thing.
[39:58.620 --> 40:01.120]  Where, I guess my example is like,
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.280]  how come the timeline for Donkey Kong doesn't make sense?
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.660]  We don't need a timeline for Donkey Kong.
[40:09.040 --> 40:10.500]  He is Donkey Kong.
[40:10.860 --> 40:13.820]  He is the monkey and he wants the banana.
[40:14.120 --> 40:16.780]  So it's more of like a consumer thing then?
[40:16.840 --> 40:18.180]  It's like the fan is...
[40:18.180 --> 40:18.720]  Yes, yes.
[40:18.880 --> 40:22.480]  Okay, because I don't think Nintendo are that strict with their lore.
[40:22.640 --> 40:23.200]  Like, look at Zelda.
[40:23.960 --> 40:26.200]  Yes, and everyone is pissed.
[40:26.300 --> 40:29.720]  Like, not everyone, but like weird nerds are pissed about,
[40:30.100 --> 40:31.360]  well, where does this fit in the timeline?
[40:31.860 --> 40:33.560]  Who gives a shit?
[40:33.760 --> 40:34.700]  It does not matter.
[40:34.700 --> 40:38.380]  Basically, if someone's there asking like, oh, what order are the Zelda games in?
[40:38.500 --> 40:40.780]  Or like, is this the same link from this game as it is in that game?
[40:40.780 --> 40:42.040]  Your answer is shut up.
[40:42.340 --> 40:43.000]  Shut up.
[40:43.220 --> 40:43.440]  Okay.
[40:43.560 --> 40:44.200]  Shut up.
[40:44.340 --> 40:45.400]  It does not matter.
[40:45.720 --> 40:46.460]  Play the game.
[40:46.580 --> 40:47.720]  I hope you enjoy the game.
[40:47.860 --> 40:50.380]  If there's stuff there and people want to...
[40:50.380 --> 40:54.500]  If the creator is like, hey, I developed it with this stuff in mind or whatever.
[40:55.000 --> 40:55.320]  Great.
[40:55.700 --> 40:56.140]  Whatever.
[40:56.680 --> 41:00.980]  When people start going like, well, here's how it fits in with the Star Wars.
[41:01.100 --> 41:03.340]  Like, Star Wars is, I guess, like the big example.
[41:03.340 --> 41:10.480]  Because when I was a kid, it was all of the books and everything of like the Star Wars extended universe.
[41:10.640 --> 41:12.380]  And like you read these books and all this stuff.
[41:12.600 --> 41:13.960]  And then they just went, no, that's real.
[41:14.300 --> 41:14.440]  Yeah.
[41:14.460 --> 41:15.520]  None of that's canon actually.
[41:15.980 --> 41:19.080]  And so it was like, but I read all these books and I really enjoyed them.
[41:19.260 --> 41:21.480]  And they go, yeah, none of that fucking means anything here.
[41:21.580 --> 41:22.340]  So fuck you.
[41:22.420 --> 41:23.580]  And it was like, okay, sick.
[41:23.840 --> 41:25.460]  So I guess it doesn't matter.
[41:25.600 --> 41:32.500]  And that's really what was like my turning point on not everything that you like has to become the biggest volume
[41:33.240 --> 41:33.600]  encyclopedia.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.800]  It can just be a thing you enjoy for a little while.
[41:35.800 --> 41:37.980]  And then you can put it away and move on.
[41:38.020 --> 41:41.080]  And you don't have to know what the timeline for Donkey Kong is.
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.520]  It can just be Donkey Kong.
[41:43.680 --> 41:44.840]  And that's fine.
[41:45.160 --> 41:51.560]  Like, people trying to figure out the Mario Brothers timeline is like the craziest thing in the world to me.
[41:51.980 --> 41:52.600]  Mario Brothers?
[41:52.780 --> 41:53.380]  You go right.
[41:53.660 --> 41:54.540]  You just go right.
[41:54.760 --> 41:55.940]  And now you can go forward and backward.
[41:56.480 --> 41:57.800]  You pull back on the stick.
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.500]  Maybe you go forward.
[41:58.600 --> 41:58.900]  I don't know.
[41:59.020 --> 41:59.980]  Nix controls are working.
[42:00.900 --> 42:01.080]  Yeah.
[42:01.080 --> 42:05.840]  I just think the lore focus of stuff is really, really frustrating to me.
[42:05.940 --> 42:06.560]  And I'm sick of it.
[42:06.620 --> 42:07.280]  I'm done with it.
[42:07.460 --> 42:09.280]  Now, to be clear, you're not opposed to all lore.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.100]  You just don't think everything needs it.
[42:11.440 --> 42:18.460]  Yes, and I don't think that fans need to deep dive on every detail of everything like Donkey Kong timelines.
[42:19.100 --> 42:20.940]  Because I love lore.
[42:21.180 --> 42:25.720]  I think sometimes stupidity of lore is sometimes my favorite thing about the thing.
[42:25.720 --> 42:33.880]  Like, I love, I truly love in Fast and Furious how fucked up that lore is because they tried to make something make sense.
[42:34.240 --> 42:36.180]  And then they decided it didn't matter anyway.
[42:36.320 --> 42:38.640]  After doing all of the work to explain it.
[42:38.720 --> 42:44.300]  Where they had a very popular character die in Tokyo Drift, which was the third film.
[42:44.860 --> 42:48.480]  And then in like movie five, they're like, fuck, we want to bring him back, but he's dead.
[42:48.520 --> 42:49.080]  How do we do that?
[42:49.400 --> 42:54.740]  Okay, we'll set five, six, and seven before three.
[42:54.740 --> 42:55.980]  We'll do that.
[42:56.080 --> 43:01.480]  Like, well, this timeline is all fucked now because we want to explain how Han can be around.
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.320]  And then they do all that.
[43:03.360 --> 43:05.040]  And then we get to the point of his death.
[43:05.300 --> 43:07.300]  And then they just bring him back anyway.
[43:07.600 --> 43:09.080]  In the most recent installment.
[43:09.380 --> 43:12.500]  And it was like, well, why did, you didn't need to do any of that work.
[43:12.560 --> 43:13.860]  Like, none of it actually mattered.
[43:13.920 --> 43:16.520]  He was just coming back regardless of what you did.
[43:17.020 --> 43:18.180]  None of it matters.
[43:18.480 --> 43:22.340]  But I love that they tried so hard to explain it in a way.
[43:22.340 --> 43:27.300]  Maybe the only attempt to like logically explain anything in any of those movies.
[43:27.380 --> 43:29.300]  And it's just crazy that they did it.
[43:29.440 --> 43:31.560]  So I love, personally, lore.
[43:33.660 --> 43:37.180]  The fan feedback around it can definitely be annoying at times.
[43:37.320 --> 43:39.060]  I think I like it because...
[43:39.060 --> 43:39.440]  That's frustrating.
[43:39.960 --> 43:44.640]  Because I grew up in a time where video games didn't look anything like the cover.
[43:45.320 --> 43:48.020]  And you'd have like pixels for like an enemy.
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.240]  And I would always be like, ooh, I'm going to read the booklet and see what this enemy actually looks like.
[43:52.240 --> 43:53.720]  And I want to learn about it.
[43:53.760 --> 43:55.280]  And why it's doing what it's doing.
[43:56.540 --> 43:58.000]  So that's interesting.
[43:58.180 --> 44:01.720]  And when I was younger, I felt the same way.
[44:01.740 --> 44:02.840]  Because we didn't have it.
[44:03.220 --> 44:05.160]  It was a thing that I was desperate for.
[44:05.500 --> 44:06.440]  I wanted more lore.
[44:06.540 --> 44:08.400]  What if all these things connected?
[44:08.800 --> 44:10.920]  And now, everything's a franchise.
[44:11.300 --> 44:12.160]  Everything connects.
[44:12.320 --> 44:14.220]  Nothing can be just on its own.
[44:14.380 --> 44:17.760]  Everything has to be, well, how does this make sense with the lore?
[44:17.940 --> 44:19.180]  And it's like, this sucks.
[44:19.180 --> 44:23.600]  I don't want it to go back to the amount that it was before where it was zero.
[44:23.880 --> 44:27.140]  But it cannot continue to be the amount that it is.
[44:27.200 --> 44:28.220]  Which is 100.
[44:28.920 --> 44:29.760]  It's too much.
[44:29.880 --> 44:31.800]  It's too much lore for every single thing.
[44:32.020 --> 44:32.400]  Yeah, I don't...
[44:32.400 --> 44:32.760]  Fair play.
[44:33.140 --> 44:34.060]  I think that's fair.
[44:34.140 --> 44:36.140]  As long as we're okay with lore existing, I'm with you.
[44:36.580 --> 44:37.840]  Oh yeah, I'm fine with it existing.
[44:38.260 --> 44:42.520]  I'm not fine with people being mad about Donkey Kong timeline.
[44:42.740 --> 44:44.100]  I'm never going to let that go.
[44:44.360 --> 44:46.820]  Donkey Kong timeline is like the craziest thing in the world to me.
[44:46.820 --> 44:49.100]  You care about when the Donkey Kong games take place?
[44:49.280 --> 44:49.820]  Donkey Kong?
[44:50.760 --> 44:51.560]  Donkey Kong?
[44:51.800 --> 44:52.260]  God damn.
[44:52.480 --> 44:53.160]  It makes me nuts.
[44:53.460 --> 44:53.880]  That's crazy.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.020]  So what is that lore?
[44:56.180 --> 44:58.380]  Is Cranky Kong the original Donkey Kong?
[44:58.820 --> 45:01.100]  Right, but that's what people posited.
[45:01.360 --> 45:03.140]  Like, oh yeah, the original Donkey Kong is Cranky Kong.
[45:03.240 --> 45:05.940]  But then this new game is coming out and Cranky Kong's in it.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.460]  And people are like, how can there be Kid Pauline?
[45:08.780 --> 45:09.840]  But Cranky Kong...
[45:09.840 --> 45:12.260]  There's people getting mad about that stuff.
[45:12.340 --> 45:13.300]  And you just go, I don't...
[45:13.300 --> 45:14.300]  I don't know, man.
[45:14.320 --> 45:14.780]  Who cares?
[45:15.100 --> 45:15.420]  I don't know.
[45:15.420 --> 45:17.740]  Is anyone wondering where Lanky Kong is these days?
[45:18.120 --> 45:19.960]  I don't think anybody wants...
[45:19.960 --> 45:21.220]  I don't think anybody wants...
[45:21.220 --> 45:22.800]  He has no style.
[45:22.920 --> 45:23.840]  He has no grace.
[45:24.440 --> 45:28.340]  Is Lanky Kong the Taylor Kitsch of the Donkey Kong universe?
[45:28.680 --> 45:28.920]  Absolutely.
[45:29.140 --> 45:30.360]  None of it is his fault.
[45:30.720 --> 45:32.680]  Yeah, Donkey is Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[45:37.640 --> 45:38.340]  That's my take.
[45:38.900 --> 45:39.700]  Thank you very much.
[45:40.480 --> 45:41.960]  Gavin, so excited.
[45:42.200 --> 45:42.640]  Go for it.
[45:42.660 --> 45:43.260]  Oh, I can't wait.
[45:46.660 --> 45:59.800]  Every time the CEO of a major global corporation takes a bonus, he first has to stand in front of each employee one by one and tell them what his bonus is about to be.
[46:00.100 --> 46:07.640]  And tell them how long it would take that employee to earn the same amount of money on their current salary.
[46:08.860 --> 46:12.260]  Just to see if after going through all that, he still wants to take the bonus.
[46:12.720 --> 46:13.260]  I love it.
[46:13.640 --> 46:14.340]  I do too.
[46:14.340 --> 46:17.060]  I think it can't be over a Zoom call or anything.
[46:17.220 --> 46:19.520]  It has to be in the same room, direct face-to-face.
[46:19.960 --> 46:23.440]  So he'll be like, hi, Edwin Jenkins.
[46:23.740 --> 46:27.680]  Okay, my bonus this year is $25 million.
[46:28.160 --> 46:32.600]  And at your current salary, it would take you 175 years to earn.
[46:33.180 --> 46:34.320]  Good to see you.
[46:34.420 --> 46:34.600]  Yeah.
[46:34.900 --> 46:40.940]  And just to see if being overloaded with that would cause any kind of guilt.
[46:41.300 --> 46:43.420]  I don't think it would, unfortunately.
[46:43.420 --> 46:47.960]  I think a lot of the people in these positions are kind of psychotic.
[46:49.720 --> 46:51.340]  Are just void of emotion.
[46:52.280 --> 46:53.940]  I really like this idea.
[46:54.080 --> 46:59.460]  I would almost like to see a scenario in which they have to pitch why they deserve their bonus.
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.640]  And then it's Squid Game style where every employee has to vote by hitting a yes or no button.
[47:05.920 --> 47:07.720]  Whether they receive it or not.
[47:08.920 --> 47:09.820]  I like that.
[47:10.000 --> 47:11.320]  What if it's like a mixed vote?
[47:11.320 --> 47:12.960]  Whatever's the majority wins.
[47:13.960 --> 47:16.060]  Yeah, they would never get a bonus.
[47:16.140 --> 47:16.380]  Yeah.
[47:17.140 --> 47:19.620]  Well, that's why you have to state your case really well.
[47:19.980 --> 47:20.120]  Yeah.
[47:20.520 --> 47:24.100]  Can you imagine any corporation on the planet...
[47:25.140 --> 47:30.180]  I think they wouldn't even get 10%, let alone 100%.
[47:30.180 --> 47:30.580]  Right.
[47:30.640 --> 47:31.160]  I think that's fair.
[47:31.680 --> 47:32.700]  Yeah, I think that's totally fine.
[47:33.040 --> 47:34.300]  Make a stronger case.
[47:34.540 --> 47:38.600]  If you're really that good and that much of a leader, you can make your case to these people that you deserve more.
[47:38.600 --> 47:41.200]  I could imagine a CEO walking out and being like,
[47:41.240 --> 47:43.300]  Listen, y'all, I know I'm not going to get my bonus this year,
[47:43.340 --> 47:48.540]  so I just want to take this time to talk about the fact that we are not smuggling enough things anally.
[47:48.860 --> 47:51.640]  Let's get into this. This could be the future.
[47:53.100 --> 47:57.040]  I like this take just because I want to see a CEO have to do that.
[47:57.300 --> 48:02.960]  I wonder if how many CEOs at the end of that experience would actually think twice about it,
[48:02.980 --> 48:05.480]  or whether they'd just be like, and that's done with for another year.
[48:06.040 --> 48:07.120]  I think it's that.
[48:07.120 --> 48:08.360]  Do you think?
[48:08.600 --> 48:09.620]  I think so too.
[48:09.900 --> 48:13.780]  What part of you is going, and David Zasloff changed his mind.
[48:14.620 --> 48:21.080]  I'm also so interested to see what his compelling case is about why he deserves the bonus.
[48:23.520 --> 48:24.760]  They're splintering now.
[48:24.840 --> 48:30.400]  It's just like, oh man, I would love to still be an employee for that meeting.
[48:30.580 --> 48:31.480]  That would be phenomenal.
[48:31.680 --> 48:34.040]  Think about how many subsidiaries some of these companies have.
[48:34.040 --> 48:39.160]  They would have to come to our company, sit down with us, and meet with Drew Saplin,
[48:39.460 --> 48:45.780]  and every other person to make the case about, all right, and here's how long you'd have to work.
[48:47.340 --> 48:48.660]  Here's what's going to happen eventually.
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.440]  On these big companies, potentially the employee will be asking the CEO,
[48:53.660 --> 48:55.480]  well, what have you actually done this year?
[48:55.600 --> 48:56.860]  What's the kind of work you've done?
[48:57.180 --> 49:02.340]  And he'll just be mainly standing in front of all my employees, telling them what my bonus is going to be.
[49:02.340 --> 49:04.600]  Because it would take so freaking long.
[49:04.900 --> 49:05.120]  Yep.
[49:05.640 --> 49:09.620]  I had the courage to rename the thing what it was originally called.
[49:09.760 --> 49:11.140]  Because I just, I had that vision.
[49:12.140 --> 49:13.020]  You're welcome.
[49:14.400 --> 49:15.620]  And you're welcome.
[49:15.780 --> 49:17.680]  Oh man, that's a good take. I like that.
[49:17.880 --> 49:18.240]  That's really good.
[49:18.340 --> 49:20.040]  That's a fantastic take.
[49:20.100 --> 49:20.860]  I like that a lot.
[49:20.960 --> 49:21.120]  Yep.
[49:21.480 --> 49:21.640]  Sweet.
[49:22.080 --> 49:23.760]  Okay, Nick, round us out.
[49:23.880 --> 49:25.680]  What is your take?
[49:26.040 --> 49:30.720]  I keep getting to follow Gavin on some pretty big, crucial takes.
[49:30.720 --> 49:34.580]  And then I get to dive bomb a little bit.
[49:34.760 --> 49:41.460]  So this one, I think a lot of people try to say that you should never put ketchup on a hot dog, right?
[49:42.240 --> 49:42.500]  Sure.
[49:42.840 --> 49:48.340]  Like, that's a thing that I don't know if you grew up with it, but all the people I knew were like, you should never put ketchup on a hot dog.
[49:48.460 --> 49:48.540]  Yeah.
[49:48.600 --> 49:53.580]  No problem with ketchup, like, on a hot dog with something else.
[49:54.280 --> 49:54.640]  My...
[49:54.640 --> 49:55.860]  You mean ketchup, right?
[49:56.160 --> 49:57.960]  I mean, you're saying ketchup, but you mean ketchup.
[49:58.460 --> 49:58.840]  Katsup?
[49:59.980 --> 50:00.360]  Katsup?
[50:00.700 --> 50:01.080]  Ketchup.
[50:01.360 --> 50:01.800]  Yeah, ketchup.
[50:02.140 --> 50:02.360]  Whatever.
[50:02.820 --> 50:03.320]  Thank you, Gavin.
[50:03.560 --> 50:03.920]  Appreciate it.
[50:04.140 --> 50:05.720]  Thank you, Gavin.
[50:06.120 --> 50:06.320]  Okay.
[50:06.740 --> 50:09.560]  I also say helicopter, hillicopter most of the time.
[50:09.740 --> 50:09.840]  Okay.
[50:10.520 --> 50:11.800]  I never noticed that one.
[50:12.040 --> 50:12.360]  Me neither.
[50:12.460 --> 50:12.860]  Now I will.
[50:13.500 --> 50:13.880]  Oh, sweet.
[50:14.080 --> 50:14.580]  Glad to hear it.
[50:14.680 --> 50:17.420]  If you push forward on a helicopter, which direction does it go?
[50:18.500 --> 50:20.780]  Well, is it attached to a neck or not?
[50:23.200 --> 50:23.920]  It depends.
[50:24.040 --> 50:25.140]  Are the controls inverted or not?
[50:25.800 --> 50:26.520]  All right, go ahead.
[50:27.240 --> 50:28.420]  Damn it.
[50:28.740 --> 50:29.280]  Are they verted?
[50:30.320 --> 50:35.140]  My argument is that ketchup should never be alone on a hot dog.
[50:35.640 --> 50:35.960]  Oh.
[50:36.340 --> 50:45.720]  Ketchup has no place being the sole condiment on a hot dog because it's too sweet and takes away from the rest of the dog itself.
[50:45.720 --> 50:55.140]  If it's ketchup and mustard, you've got that nice bit of, you know, comparison, more the acidity of the mustard going with the ketchup sweetness.
[50:55.420 --> 50:57.320]  And that complements the dog pretty well, right?
[50:57.400 --> 50:58.740]  With a relish, it's pretty good.
[50:58.760 --> 51:00.520]  With onion, it's cutting through a little bit.
[51:00.580 --> 51:02.120]  Even if you had, like, chili.
[51:02.640 --> 51:06.160]  So my argument is ketchup alone on a hot dog, gross.
[51:06.480 --> 51:08.120]  With other stuff, good.
[51:08.820 --> 51:12.600]  I wonder if you're going to lose this poll just because of the ketchup thing.
[51:12.980 --> 51:13.260]  Yeah.
[51:13.260 --> 51:20.780]  In the same way that people get so upset when people call Mario, Mario, because that's how they pronounce that there.
[51:21.400 --> 51:23.600]  I'm so fascinated to see the ketchup reaction.
[51:23.740 --> 51:28.480]  I also feel like never before have you said ketchup so much like catch.
[51:29.500 --> 51:33.200]  I felt like even after calling it out, you went even harder on it somehow.
[51:33.640 --> 51:35.300]  Like some of them, you were just saying catch.
[51:35.860 --> 51:36.240]  Ketchup.
[51:36.720 --> 51:37.000]  Ketchup?
[51:37.180 --> 51:38.480]  Is it ketchup? It's ketchup? Okay.
[51:38.720 --> 51:38.980]  Ketchup.
[51:40.260 --> 51:41.060]  Okay, so...
[51:41.760 --> 51:46.600]  In the event of no condiment at all or just plain hot dog, it's plain hot dog for you?
[51:46.800 --> 51:47.480]  Is that the...
[51:48.240 --> 51:50.860]  In the event of no condiment at all or plain hot dog.
[51:50.860 --> 51:55.160]  So if you're going to get a hot dog and the only thing they have is ketchup, that means you're just going to have that plain.
[51:55.160 --> 51:55.560]  Oh yeah, plain dog.
[51:56.040 --> 51:56.180]  Yeah.
[51:56.380 --> 51:56.700]  Okay.
[51:57.540 --> 51:59.520]  I'll take a dry dog over a ketchup dog.
[51:59.920 --> 52:01.760]  Would you allow some solo mustard though?
[52:02.020 --> 52:03.300]  Yeah, that's totally acceptable.
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.000]  Mustard is a very complimentary flavor to the hot dog.
[52:06.660 --> 52:08.080]  How do you feel about ketchup generally?
[52:08.080 --> 52:14.080]  I love it. It's good on fries. It works well, you know, with a burger, ketchup, mustard, good stuff.
[52:14.560 --> 52:14.920]  Huh.
[52:15.060 --> 52:20.740]  But on its own, on a dog, just a weird flavor profile. Don't like it. Shouldn't allow it.
[52:21.220 --> 52:23.980]  Wow. I've never... Wow.
[52:24.780 --> 52:31.520]  And you think it's so bad that people shouldn't be allowed to do it? Just generally? Should it just be outlawed? Should it be a banned combination?
[52:32.240 --> 52:34.920]  Well, I hadn't thought of it that way until you mentioned it, but yeah.
[52:35.860 --> 52:36.420]  Fuck em.
[52:36.420 --> 52:36.740]  What?
[52:39.860 --> 52:40.220]  Oh.
[52:40.340 --> 52:43.980]  I'm a ketchup only dog guy, so I'm going to have to completely...
[52:43.980 --> 52:44.200]  Are you really?
[52:44.840 --> 52:45.200]  Yeah.
[52:45.360 --> 52:45.880]  Oh, wow.
[52:46.180 --> 52:47.180]  Absolutely, I am.
[52:47.180 --> 52:47.940]  So sorry to hear that.
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.520]  Mustard guy. Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to change how I do it.
[52:50.820 --> 52:58.340]  I think it's so inoffensive. And I think the benefits of ketchup compared with a plain dog, it's like absolutely astronomical.
[52:58.560 --> 53:02.320]  I would always go for the ketchup over nothing. And I'm not even a big ketchup guy.
[53:02.940 --> 53:03.400]  Hey, Nick.
[53:03.960 --> 53:04.320]  Yeah, yeah.
[53:04.320 --> 53:06.260]  I'm going to go with you. Why not?
[53:06.480 --> 53:06.920]  Yeah!
[53:07.980 --> 53:09.080]  Surely you don't believe that.
[53:09.420 --> 53:12.560]  No, absolutely. No, I don't. But I got it. Somebody's got to be on the side here.
[53:12.820 --> 53:13.260]  No, they don't.
[53:14.200 --> 53:16.440]  I don't want non-believers on my team.
[53:16.640 --> 53:16.780]  Yeah.
[53:17.060 --> 53:18.240]  I don't want non-believers.
[53:18.240 --> 53:19.860]  He doesn't want any charity support.
[53:20.980 --> 53:23.740]  Someone's got to help this guy. He's hanging by a thread here.
[53:24.340 --> 53:24.440]  Nope.
[53:24.440 --> 53:27.540]  He's telling people they're not allowed to have ketchup.
[53:27.540 --> 53:31.600]  Look, Archie will learn both things. No ketchup on dog alone.
[53:31.840 --> 53:33.720]  Oh, is this something that he does right now?
[53:33.720 --> 53:36.340]  No, he doesn't fucking eat condiments.
[53:36.680 --> 53:40.320]  What are you about to say?
[53:40.700 --> 53:42.840]  That little non-sauce monkey.
[53:45.420 --> 53:47.520]  He is the opposite of that character.
[53:47.720 --> 53:50.900]  The sauce guy banning sauces. That's crazy.
[53:51.020 --> 53:57.660]  But I think that it's in lieu of, it's not just banning the sauce, it's in lieu of like, you need more sauces. I can't just be the single sauce.
[53:57.840 --> 54:02.400]  I think a hot dog might be the most in need of condiment food that exists.
[54:02.400 --> 54:03.960]  Yeah, I don't disagree.
[54:04.280 --> 54:08.480]  So he's telling you put a bunch of condiments on that sucker.
[54:08.780 --> 54:09.760]  Yeah, together.
[54:10.300 --> 54:15.900]  There's a certain point where when I'm putting condiments on a dog where I feel like the effort is more than what it's worth.
[54:16.480 --> 54:19.560]  I don't want to have to open three different bottles for my hot dog.
[54:20.040 --> 54:20.460]  I hear that.
[54:20.820 --> 54:21.320]  It's too much.
[54:21.320 --> 54:26.880]  If you had one bottle with three nozzles and it was just a singular squeeze for all the condiments.
[54:27.460 --> 54:29.260]  Somebody get uniform on the phone.
[54:31.920 --> 54:34.100]  The relish hole would have to be quite big.
[54:34.620 --> 54:37.240]  Didn't they do that with like a peanut butter and jelly back in the day?
[54:37.940 --> 54:39.800]  I mean, you can get little jars of the same shit.
[54:40.260 --> 54:40.600]  Yes.
[54:40.940 --> 54:43.380]  Like all that goober gross looking goob shit.
[54:43.500 --> 54:45.320]  That is what it was called. It was called goober.
[54:45.700 --> 54:47.740]  It was like striped. Yeah, it looked disgusting.
[54:47.960 --> 54:53.700]  Yeah, I saw that in stores the first time I came to America. I was like, what the hell is wrong with this place?
[54:53.720 --> 54:54.260]  What have they done?
[54:54.260 --> 54:59.880]  Is it illegal to have it in England or is it just sort of frowned upon so you have to put it in your ass to get it there?
[55:02.620 --> 55:07.520]  British customs looking for goober and mines in my ass.
[55:07.600 --> 55:08.880]  They can't do anything about it.
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.640]  We know he has goober and we know his jelly ratings are off the chart on this.
[55:15.340 --> 55:16.740]  This goddamn goober.
[55:18.060 --> 55:22.080]  Doing a 10 hour flight with an ass load of goober would be an absolute nightmare.
[55:22.600 --> 55:24.520]  You hear the jar crack?
[55:24.780 --> 55:25.520]  Oh, no.
[55:26.460 --> 55:27.440]  Oh, man.
[55:27.620 --> 55:28.540]  That'd be terrible.
[55:29.140 --> 55:29.880]  Oh, man.
[55:30.060 --> 55:31.720]  What a bunch of interesting takes.
[55:31.940 --> 55:33.840]  Really, really, really interesting takes.
[55:34.000 --> 55:40.720]  I mean, this show was created so that way Taylor Kitsch could have something to do, but it really took us down some rabbit holes.
[55:41.880 --> 55:43.440]  Very, very interesting.
[55:44.500 --> 55:48.580]  I'm so excited to see how the audience feels about these takes.
[55:48.920 --> 55:51.800]  I'm interested in audience opinion on the poll.
[55:51.800 --> 55:53.560]  I'm interested in the audience takes.
[55:53.700 --> 55:56.320]  I'm interested in if they want us to do another round of takes.
[55:56.540 --> 55:57.640]  Geoff's take is included.
[55:57.940 --> 55:59.840]  I'm sure Geoff would have some great takes.
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.540]  I mean, it's not going to be inverted versus verted, but it will be something, so I'm very curious.
[56:06.520 --> 56:08.900]  Maybe he's a secret inverter.
[56:09.880 --> 56:10.920]  A secret inverter?
[56:11.520 --> 56:11.960]  He's not.
[56:12.440 --> 56:13.220]  You know, it's crazy.
[56:14.060 --> 56:19.040]  I feel like my first take was so wild and useless,
[56:19.040 --> 56:22.680]  yet somehow, I still agree with it more than both of Nick's picks.
[56:26.100 --> 56:27.540]  Well, incredible.
[56:27.740 --> 56:29.460]  What's it like to be wrong?
[56:29.640 --> 56:30.240]  I'm wrong a lot.
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.120]  We'll see. Maybe he's right. Maybe the audience will.
[56:33.560 --> 56:35.500]  No confidence in asking Gavin a question.
[56:35.920 --> 56:38.080]  How does it feel?
[56:40.060 --> 56:41.080]  Anyway, vote in the poll.
[56:41.080 --> 56:42.120]  Was that the end of the sentence?
[56:42.420 --> 56:43.080]  Oh my god.
[56:43.480 --> 56:44.620]  Vote in the poll.
[56:44.760 --> 56:47.660]  Make sure to check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[56:48.660 --> 56:49.540]  RegulationPod.com.
[56:49.960 --> 56:50.980]  I can't wait to see what happens.
[56:51.500 --> 56:55.180]  So, they're voting for the worst take? Is that what it is?
[56:55.240 --> 57:01.240]  They're voting for the worst take to see who will have to hang the idiot flag on themselves.
[57:01.640 --> 57:02.400]  Pretty exciting.
[57:02.680 --> 57:03.320]  Well, that's good stuff.
[57:03.340 --> 57:03.680]  I can't get home.
[57:04.040 --> 57:04.540]  Pretty cool.
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.020]  Well, thanks guys. Thanks for listening. Thanks for listening to Regulation Takes.
[57:08.260 --> 57:10.320]  Let us know your takes in the comments. Maybe that helps.
[57:11.280 --> 57:12.980]  And we'll see you next time. Bye!
[57:13.300 --> 57:13.500]  Bye!
[57:14.560 --> 57:15.380]  Be nice.
