[00:00.740 --> 00:08.600]  Well, what are we doing here? Uh, we have received a package from prop store auctions dot...
[00:09.140 --> 00:14.000]  sucks or whatever. What is it? Geoff? Yep. Uh-huh. I don't know what it's saying. Oh my god, please
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.720]  don't stab it. Oh yeah, don't do that. Just go easy. That's how I have to get in. No. With a screwdriver?
[00:19.200 --> 00:26.920]  Yeah, I couldn't find a knife, so I'm just gonna... That's so much of our actual money. Yeah, and also
[00:26.920 --> 00:32.600]  a one-of-a-kind thing. Yeah. So I'm stabbing the outside, not the inside. That's what we're hoping.
[00:34.900 --> 00:38.180]  That works. All right, I only need some scissors.
[00:39.980 --> 00:44.580]  What about this? You don't have scissors? You don't have a drill in here without scissors?
[00:45.320 --> 00:48.700]  Why would you use a drill? It's like a screwdriver, but better. Let's see if it has batteries.
[00:51.400 --> 00:59.860]  Okay. Hide it. Nick is gonna... I didn't have anywhere else to go. Oh, don't! Odd choice Nick made.
[01:02.940 --> 01:09.320]  All right, I'm feeling excited. I don't know what exactly this is gonna look like or anything.
[01:09.920 --> 01:15.740]  Safety first, always cut towards the body. Yeah, we're not at target. Yeah. Nick, you wanna close those
[01:15.740 --> 01:18.520]  scissors up, move them out of the way? Yep. Thanks, man. You know what, I'm gonna take that
[01:19.940 --> 01:23.700]  All right, this is our unboxing from what we bought at the prop auction. So,
[01:23.760 --> 01:28.560]  are you handing me the paper? The film of lading or whatever? I'll have a look at it.
[01:28.920 --> 01:35.060]  Oh, it's heavy. Is it? Certificate of Authenticity, Rick Santoro's Nicholas Cage's
[01:35.060 --> 01:41.080]  screen-matched bloodied costume. I was gonna say Rick Santorum. Rick Santorum's
[01:41.080 --> 01:44.180]  screen-matched bloody costume. I'm gonna need them scissors back.
[01:44.180 --> 01:51.860]  There you go. Yeah, it's gonna get real dangerous for a second. Also, Certificate of Authenticity,
[01:52.640 --> 01:58.660]  Rick Santoro, Nicholas Cage, jewelry set. This might be what I'm opening up, right?
[02:02.240 --> 02:08.160]  We're gonna see who has the most cage-like fingers. Oh, look at those. All right, here.
[02:09.560 --> 02:15.360]  Great, Nicholas Cage wore this ring. 1979, look at that baby. Do you think he misses it? Yeah,
[02:15.580 --> 02:21.220]  he's got the R, the Rick Santoro. Look at this watch. Dude, look at this. This is all from a
[02:21.220 --> 02:27.700]  great 1998 movie that you guys refused to put on the list. Isn't this awesome? Look at that. Oh my
[02:27.700 --> 02:34.520]  god, it fits like a dream. Look at that. The character he was born to play. You're Ricky.
[02:34.520 --> 02:40.700]  Dude, look at that. Hey, I'm Nicholas Cage. Look at me. I'm that guy from movies.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.220]  Does that have Nick Cage? I got a crazy face. Did I just see long legs?
[02:47.920 --> 02:53.820]  Dude, these are crazy. This is really... Nick Cage wore this just like every day when he was
[02:53.820 --> 03:02.000]  filming this movie that is medium good. When he became this character, he was Ricky. He was
[03:02.000 --> 03:13.740]  Rick Santoro. Ricky has complicated jewelry. Okay, there we go.
[03:17.360 --> 03:20.760]  This watch is difficult. It was confusing to get off.
[03:25.220 --> 03:32.380]  Okay, wrist in. Now push that up towards your wrist, yeah, and then close. Oh, you've done
[03:32.380 --> 03:40.060]  this. What a watch, yeah. Look at that. Oh, I see you've bought movie watches before.
[03:41.120 --> 03:49.000]  Anyway, if it would... Hey, what's up with that? I'm Ricky from the movie. I'm Ricky from the
[03:49.000 --> 04:00.320]  movie. I'm putting all this on. Oh, wow. What's that? The shoe? Oh, wow. Oh, those are some heifers.
[04:01.760 --> 04:03.900]  Whoa. What size? 12? 45?
[04:09.620 --> 04:14.360]  Okay, all right. Don't lick them, Nick. What the fuck? I'm over here.
[04:24.090 --> 04:26.670]  You know, they're not too far off.
[04:28.730 --> 04:32.130]  Are me and Nicolas Cage about the same size? That can't be right.
[04:32.730 --> 04:38.490]  It's gotta be taller. He has to be. This can't... Put that next to your actual shoe.
[04:41.690 --> 04:44.950]  It's just, it's a box shoe. It's just a long, it's just a long toe.
[04:45.050 --> 04:48.950]  That's the style. Yeah. Whoa. Is this it? Is this the blood stains?
[04:52.770 --> 04:56.470]  Oh, damn. I can't put this on right now. We gotta save some of it, right? Yeah,
[04:56.570 --> 05:01.350]  maybe the jacket though. Oh, I'll put the jacket on. Here we go. You ready, Mr. Ricky?
[05:04.230 --> 05:10.310]  Are me and Nick Cage about the same size? That can't be right. It's not. That looks like...
[05:12.350 --> 05:17.930]  Is my dad Nick Cage? Am I wearing my dad's suit? It's like, it, like the arms are, this,
[05:18.510 --> 05:26.290]  the suit is really only about that far off. Yeah. It's like, it, it's really an inch.
[05:27.650 --> 05:31.850]  I think you should try the jacket too. Oh, definitely. See if it's a better fit.
[05:32.350 --> 05:39.750]  No. Not bad. Wow. Not bad, right? Pretty good. Pretty good. Pretty good. Hey, I'm Ricky.
[05:40.670 --> 05:49.170]  How are we? Check it out, everybody. I'm a boisterous guy named Ricky. Snake eyes. Vegas,
[05:49.310 --> 05:55.310]  baby. Vegas Ricky. How are we all about the same size? We should go to Vegas and wear this suit.
[05:55.450 --> 06:01.830]  Yeah. How are we all about the same size as Nick Cage? That's weird. It's crazy. That's
[06:01.830 --> 06:07.390]  weird. It's almost like he's just one of us. He's another human man. He's another human man?
[06:08.090 --> 06:12.510]  I guess I should watch this movie now. I was just, we should do a watch a watch a watch.
[06:12.530 --> 06:18.610]  Oh yeah. Yeah. You're not, you're going to be upset, I think, by some of it. Okay. I think
[06:18.610 --> 06:24.130]  you're going to go, wow, this is almost, why'd they do this? What is this choice? Um, I think
[06:24.130 --> 06:30.050]  that's, make sure there's nothing else in the box, but I think that that's largely it. Although
[06:31.410 --> 06:37.210]  I do have the blood. Is that blood? Oh, it is blood. We'll get the blood on it. In the movie,
[06:37.310 --> 06:41.830]  is that his blood or someone else's? I can't tell you. This shirt's big, but this is a 90s shirt.
[06:42.370 --> 06:45.770]  90s shirt's a little big. Yeah. That's a big shirt. See, if we go to Vegas, you could wear
[06:45.770 --> 06:51.570]  that by the pool. Nick Cage or Tony Soprano. And then you go, Gavin Free, and you go, oh,
[06:51.570 --> 06:56.890]  you get a lot of drinks for free? I do now. Everyone goes, ah, ah! And then you don't get
[06:56.890 --> 07:03.910]  anything for free. I got nothing. Yep. Might as well, since we're here, what is this? Go into
[07:03.910 --> 07:11.150]  the closet, the fun closet. What? What? Pull out this bad boy. Is there a second face? No,
[07:11.470 --> 07:15.910]  what is this? Oh, wait, hang on. That's the address for where we used to work. Oh, yeah,
[07:15.930 --> 07:23.390]  I didn't know. But what's this? Now imagine that you didn't listen to the episode where Andrew
[07:23.390 --> 07:28.950]  just went, hey, I just found a tuxedo, or whatever. Imagine that this is the time where
[07:28.950 --> 07:36.270]  you're going, can you believe it? It's back. I haven't actually even looked at it. Back in the
[07:36.270 --> 07:42.430]  thing, it's preserved. Look, they put it back. Lot number 1399, Jimmy Chong's, Jackie Chan's
[07:42.430 --> 07:50.170]  tuxedo. Here it is. Official, official, official. Gavin, why don't you pop that jacket on, see?
[07:50.170 --> 07:56.030]  Oh, yeah, that's great. Now we're talking. All right, let me get, okay, there we go.
[07:57.490 --> 08:02.430]  Then, oh, it's got some Jackie Chan stains. Yeah, you got Jackie Chan stains on it. All right,
[08:02.710 --> 08:06.890]  Gavin. Let's see. Made in Italy. You like that, right?
[08:08.250 --> 08:14.250]  Loved me some Italy. It's where you're from. Oh, it's an armadish. Yeah, it was an actual
[08:14.250 --> 08:23.570]  Armani suit. Look at, wow, look at this. A bit big? No, not at all. Am I putting your arms
[08:23.570 --> 08:29.650]  staring at Jackie Chan right now? That fits you, that fits you pretty well. That's really nice.
[08:29.730 --> 08:33.810]  Yeah, I like it. It's quite an Armani suit. It's a modern cut. I feel like I could fight in this.
[08:33.810 --> 08:35.310]  It's quite free.
[08:41.250 --> 08:47.070]  Our collection grows. And back where it belongs. Yep. Yay. We got it back. We have them with the
[08:47.070 --> 08:51.410]  family next to the boots, which by the way, Nick, you start stretching out those calves, buddy.
[08:52.650 --> 08:57.150]  It's on you, bud. Oh, I'm so happy. What if my calves are too big for those boots? I feel like
[08:57.150 --> 09:01.870]  they're not. If your calves are too big for those boots, you've been working hard. I'm about to.
[09:01.870 --> 09:08.090]  Let's have a look. Oh, look at the me there. Me, right? That's some definition.
[09:08.230 --> 09:17.570]  Me. Yeah. I'm fine. Now that, you look at home in that thing, even with the blood. Hang on.
[09:19.230 --> 09:25.790]  If I were ever to be eccentric rich, I think I would have a wardrobe that's just of movie props.
[09:26.050 --> 09:30.650]  Oh, dude, that would be so cool. Like every day you just cosplay as a different person from a movie.
[09:31.370 --> 09:34.870]  This is all you get for right now until we actually do the shoot. Remember,
[09:34.930 --> 09:39.210]  we got to keep this nice because you can't watch that. No, no, no, no. I can't. Oh,
[09:39.330 --> 09:48.230]  the dog just sneezed on my ankle. Oh, it's so wet. Hi, fuck it. Yeah, it's from a different movie.
[09:49.770 --> 09:54.350]  We're going to do this photo of you. We're going to do the photo of you. We're going to eventually
[09:54.350 --> 09:59.870]  do a photo of one of me and one of Andrew. And then we all get to do the Avengers photo.
[10:00.530 --> 10:08.290]  Yeah, the team up and we do our like, yeah, regulation assemble. That's cool. Wow,
[10:09.050 --> 10:15.090]  dude, this is awesome. I can't believe we have the actual stuff from this fucking cheating movie.
[10:15.790 --> 10:22.110]  If if you're out there and you have Condor Man, oh my God, the way you gotta let me know. Yep.
[10:23.590 --> 10:26.730]  Look at this one. This is great. Look at that.
[10:28.630 --> 10:33.170]  Oh, it's a trail. Oh, it's a trip. Oh, yeah. Well, wait, you see, you see in the movie exactly
[10:33.170 --> 10:38.070]  what happens. Yeah, check it out. It's pretty cool. I think it's a Brian De Palma movie.
[10:38.410 --> 10:42.890]  I believe you're right. Yeah, it's but it's not but it's a 90s Brian De Palma movie.
[10:44.650 --> 10:50.810]  So yeah, a bit of a yikes. Yeah. I'm excited to watch it with you, Gavin. We got to do it. Yeah,
[10:50.830 --> 10:55.030]  should we do a group watch? Yeah, I think we got to do a watch along. Maybe we'll do it live for
[10:55.030 --> 10:58.330]  Falcons and then we put it out for everyone. Yeah, let's do a live with Falcons. Yeah,
[10:58.370 --> 11:03.170]  that sounds like a fantastic idea. I think that's like the move. This was awesome. I'm so glad we
[11:03.170 --> 11:09.090]  got this stuff. I cannot believe we all getting the jewelry, I think is such a move. Yeah, I
[11:09.090 --> 11:14.230]  would have thought. What's your favorite piece from this collection? I think this ring sucks in a way
[11:14.230 --> 11:19.970]  that rocks. It is 1979. It's like a class ring. Yeah, it's got like a little devil man on it.
[11:21.250 --> 11:29.550]  Oh, let me go. Let me go. Look at that. That weird. I think it's definitely the ring. I think
[11:29.550 --> 11:36.990]  that's the coolest piece. The I think Geoff really likes the Ricky wristlet. Yeah. He started
[11:36.990 --> 11:43.310]  screaming about being Vegas Ricky. So I think that's, but this shirt's a close second. I think
[11:43.310 --> 11:49.290]  it's really great. Love it. Uh huh. Well, thanks for watching this. That's it until the next prop
[11:49.290 --> 11:54.490]  store auction. What will we get next time? Yeah. What will we get next time? Something that makes
[11:54.490 --> 12:02.970]  sense. Should we get some mannequins in the, in this room or an office? Oh, because I don't know,
[12:03.070 --> 12:07.990]  but I look the room. I just had to put this table in to do this. And that's all of the real estate.
[12:08.590 --> 12:12.090]  This is what I'm saying. We need everyone to know when we were like, we have a P.O. box,
[12:12.150 --> 12:16.790]  check it out. And I said, don't send anything. There's nowhere to put it. And you went nice.
[12:16.790 --> 12:20.950]  And then does Emily know? And you went, don't send anything. Yeah. You're that's it. We,
[12:21.090 --> 12:26.410]  there's nowhere to put anything. Thanks for watching. I'm very excited to take the full
[12:26.410 --> 12:33.190]  picture with all of this stuff. This is the worst material on a jacket, but when you watch the movie,
[12:33.390 --> 12:36.930]  you'll really get it. Like you'll be like, I'm excited to see this movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[12:37.150 --> 12:39.670]  Let's end on a zoom in on a cute photo of me and my mom.
[12:39.670 --> 12:42.470]  Oh, thank you, Rick.
