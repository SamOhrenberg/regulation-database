[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  Who do you think is going to hate this movie the most, Eric?
[00:03.120 --> 00:03.400]  Geoff!
[00:03.820 --> 00:05.320]  I think Eric might.
[00:05.560 --> 00:06.780]  I think Eric might.
[00:07.280 --> 00:08.320]  I might like it.
[00:09.400 --> 00:12.660]  You think you're going to like the Nickelodeon... the chat agrees with me.
[00:12.800 --> 00:16.100]  The Nickelodeon movie from the year 2000 is going to be...
[00:16.100 --> 00:17.540]  Is this a Nickelodeon movie?
[00:17.960 --> 00:19.420]  It's a Nickelodeon film.
[00:19.820 --> 00:20.760]  But you saw it in the theaters?
[00:21.400 --> 00:22.380]  I sure did.
[00:23.220 --> 00:23.620]  How was that one?
[00:23.640 --> 00:24.900]  Was it theatrically released?
[00:25.620 --> 00:25.720]  Yeah, it was.
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.100]  Was it Nickelodeon Films or something?
[00:27.240 --> 00:29.340]  Yeah, Nickelodeon Studios.
[00:29.340 --> 00:30.840]  Like Good Burger?
[00:31.260 --> 00:32.260]  Like Good Burger.
[00:32.460 --> 00:36.940]  At a time in the late 90s and early 2000s was trying to make films.
[00:37.320 --> 00:46.340]  They were doing movies and I don't know that they banged, but they sure made them.
[00:46.500 --> 00:48.380]  At the time, for me, they sure did.
[00:48.820 --> 00:50.520]  Rugrats goes to Paris, classic.
[00:50.920 --> 00:52.860]  Rugrats the movie, all kinds of things.
[00:53.340 --> 00:58.400]  The universally loved and easy to work with Chevy Chase is in this film?
[00:58.400 --> 00:59.080]  Yes.
[00:59.080 --> 00:59.440]  Oh, yeah.
[00:59.440 --> 00:59.840]  Uh huh.
[00:59.900 --> 01:00.220]  Uh huh.
[01:01.560 --> 01:01.820]  Okay.
[01:02.020 --> 01:02.400]  Him and Chris Elliott.
[01:02.920 --> 01:04.020]  So I haven't seen this movie.
[01:04.320 --> 01:05.000]  Chris Elliott's in this film?
[01:05.160 --> 01:05.320]  Yeah.
[01:05.460 --> 01:06.720]  Chris Elliott is in this movie.
[01:06.940 --> 01:07.920]  He is the best part of this movie.
[01:07.960 --> 01:09.120]  Oh, I guarantee you I like this movie.
[01:09.280 --> 01:11.000]  I've never not liked Chris Elliott.
[01:11.940 --> 01:13.520]  So what I enjoyed...
[01:13.520 --> 01:14.040]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[01:14.060 --> 01:17.580]  Andrew, you were saying that he's just trying to do his job in this movie?
[01:17.660 --> 01:17.720]  Yes.
[01:18.020 --> 01:20.980]  So I watched this as a child and was like, fuck Chris Elliott.
[01:21.100 --> 01:21.700]  He sucks.
[01:21.760 --> 01:22.400]  He's the villain.
[01:22.540 --> 01:22.720]  Yeah.
[01:22.880 --> 01:28.340]  And then I saw like 10 minutes of this a few years ago and it was, oh, he's just a snow
[01:28.340 --> 01:29.000]  plow driver.
[01:29.120 --> 01:34.200]  Like, he's weird, but like he's just doing his job, which is very funny.
[01:35.280 --> 01:38.920]  I just found out that Chris Elliott's daughter was like on SNL.
[01:39.340 --> 01:40.000]  Abby Elliott.
[01:40.180 --> 01:40.360]  Yeah.
[01:40.820 --> 01:41.420]  Abby Elliott.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.960]  I only just found out that that's her.
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.820]  I didn't know that that was...
[01:44.820 --> 01:45.660]  I didn't know that was Chris Elliott's daughter.
[01:45.660 --> 01:45.840]  Oh, really?
[01:46.620 --> 01:50.760]  I think she also, uh, I don't remember it was, I remember it was in like the gossip,
[01:50.900 --> 01:54.220]  the trades, but I believe she had a bad time on SNL or it didn't go well or something.
[01:54.680 --> 01:56.220]  I believe that that is true.
[01:56.320 --> 01:58.180]  I think she was only there for like a little while, wasn't she?
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.320]  Yeah, like maybe two seasons.
[01:59.800 --> 02:00.460]  SNL 2008 to 2012.
[02:01.380 --> 02:01.780]  Just funny.
[02:01.800 --> 02:02.000]  Crazy.
[02:02.000 --> 02:02.400]  I remember thinking she was funny.
[02:02.400 --> 02:02.840]  I crunched the show.
[02:04.740 --> 02:05.720]  What was that, Gavin?
[02:07.100 --> 02:08.900]  It's just crunch the show, isn't it?
[02:09.260 --> 02:11.760]  That whole sort of having to do that shit every week.
[02:11.880 --> 02:13.440]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13.520 --> 02:19.500]  I think it's for people who are addicted to the crunch and also for a while, cocaine.
[02:20.500 --> 02:23.960]  And who want to be the next Adam Sandler and turn into a movie star.
[02:24.620 --> 02:25.020]  Yes.
[02:25.060 --> 02:26.540]  I think that has a lot to do with it also.
[02:26.540 --> 02:28.060]  Kyle Mooney's been making a lot of movies.
[02:28.120 --> 02:28.700]  I think that's great.
[02:29.200 --> 02:29.440]  Yeah.
[02:29.720 --> 02:30.420]  Kyle Mooney's great, dude.
[02:31.400 --> 02:31.580]  Yeah.
[02:31.660 --> 02:31.940]  Awesome.
[02:32.160 --> 02:33.080]  I mean, I don't know personally.
[02:33.200 --> 02:33.820]  I just think he's funny.
[02:34.780 --> 02:35.580]  He's a San Diego guy.
[02:35.620 --> 02:36.180]  So you got to love him.
[02:36.300 --> 02:36.660]  Guys.
[02:36.800 --> 02:37.480]  Here's the thing.
[02:37.720 --> 02:39.840]  I think it's time for us to begin watching Snow Day.
[02:39.920 --> 02:41.540]  Is everyone locked in Snow Day style?
[02:41.700 --> 02:42.160]  I think we're ready.
[02:42.540 --> 02:43.260]  I am so locked in.
[02:43.640 --> 02:44.040]  All right, cool.
[02:44.060 --> 02:46.380]  I'm going to dim my screen to make it slightly more cinematic.
[02:46.980 --> 02:48.000]  Oh, that's fun for you.
[02:49.020 --> 02:50.180]  I'm going to go all in on Nick.
[02:50.300 --> 02:52.160]  I had the soundtrack to this movie.
[02:52.240 --> 02:54.080]  This was a big movie in my childhood.
[02:54.720 --> 02:55.320]  I loved it.
[02:56.360 --> 03:00.000]  So, are we introing this like we would a regular piece of content then?
[03:00.160 --> 03:00.960]  Just to...
[03:00.960 --> 03:04.240]  I think everything we just did could be the intro to this and now we can start it.
[03:04.420 --> 03:05.220]  So we just count it down.
[03:05.760 --> 03:07.040]  Hey, someone in chat, do the intro.
[03:10.360 --> 03:11.560]  Nick, count them down.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.120]  All right, guys.
[03:13.140 --> 03:17.520]  We're going to start the movie in three, two, one.
[03:18.060 --> 03:18.460]  Go.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.200]  Oh my God.
[03:20.320 --> 03:21.220]  I got a piece of trivia.
[03:21.560 --> 03:27.100]  According to Dashcam Underscore One, Snow Day was first referenced in F*** Face Podcast
[03:27.100 --> 03:27.940]  episode 22.
[03:28.560 --> 03:29.540]  Is that right?
[03:29.900 --> 03:30.420]  Some history.
[03:31.340 --> 03:31.820]  Wow.
[03:32.520 --> 03:33.920]  I like the old Paramount logo.
[03:34.960 --> 03:35.360]  Yeah, it's great.
[03:35.580 --> 03:36.020]  Is it different now?
[03:36.360 --> 03:37.700]  It's just a lot fancier.
[03:38.740 --> 03:39.460]  A little bit more HD.
[03:39.640 --> 03:40.620]  Whoa, that's a lot of snow.
[03:41.340 --> 03:41.640]  Oh.
[03:42.280 --> 03:44.760]  This is on VHS.
[03:47.260 --> 03:48.420]  It looks that way.
[03:49.620 --> 03:50.240]  That's cool.
[03:50.480 --> 03:51.540]  It's like younger age.
[03:57.120 --> 04:00.600]  Wow, there's a lot of logos and stuff.
[04:00.740 --> 04:01.440]  Oh, never mind.
[04:06.000 --> 04:06.400]  Nerd.
[04:06.580 --> 04:07.080]  Oh my God.
[04:07.220 --> 04:07.780]  Put me to sleep.
[04:18.170 --> 04:19.210]  The rebel alive.
[04:23.970 --> 04:26.270]  They say that no two snowflakes are the same.
[04:26.410 --> 04:27.130]  Is that true?
[04:27.190 --> 04:28.390]  Or is that just like a thing?
[04:28.730 --> 04:29.330]  I think it's true.
[04:29.430 --> 04:29.670]  Like people say.
[04:30.210 --> 04:30.810]  I think it's true.
[04:33.190 --> 04:34.410]  Yeah, those things are no joke.
[04:36.470 --> 04:36.830]  Snowflakes?
[04:37.450 --> 04:37.810]  Yeah.
[04:38.150 --> 04:39.370]  It's no snow fluke.
[04:40.190 --> 04:44.510]  But isn't it like a, it's not like a, like a fingerprints thing where it's like by the
[04:44.510 --> 04:46.730]  numbers you have fingerprints that are like someone else probably?
[04:47.850 --> 04:48.430]  No, I don't think so.
[04:48.430 --> 04:49.710]  Why are you used to stuff being the same?
[04:49.750 --> 04:51.090]  Like have you ever seen two of the same leaf?
[04:51.530 --> 04:54.210]  Are you used to stuff being the same?
[04:55.070 --> 04:55.430]  Yeah.
[04:55.550 --> 04:57.910]  I feel like I've probably seen two of the same leaf.
[04:57.970 --> 04:58.150]  Yeah.
[04:58.490 --> 04:58.990]  There's no way.
[05:00.250 --> 05:01.110]  You don't think so?
[05:01.230 --> 05:01.490]  Yeah, I mean.
[05:01.930 --> 05:02.470]  Pretty similar, right?
[05:02.470 --> 05:03.730]  You don't think there's twin leaves?
[05:03.790 --> 05:04.570]  Like there's twin humans?
[05:05.510 --> 05:06.950]  Where does this movie take place?
[05:07.950 --> 05:08.330]  Whoa.
[05:08.530 --> 05:09.270]  I don't know.
[05:09.630 --> 05:10.170]  Oh, Michigan.
[05:11.430 --> 05:13.510]  Are you just guessing or is that true?
[05:14.270 --> 05:15.250]  Oh no, I'm just saying that.
[05:15.810 --> 05:19.510]  I figured Canada because Andrew's Canadian and it was cold, but I just realized that's
[05:19.510 --> 05:20.050]  probably not true.
[05:21.090 --> 05:22.090]  Looks like the Northeast.
[05:22.290 --> 05:23.230]  We're about to find out.
[05:28.680 --> 05:29.080]  Syracuse.
[05:29.180 --> 05:29.660]  Oh no.
[05:34.140 --> 05:36.680]  That's like how it is in Austin right now.
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.640]  Did she say hot body?
[05:42.020 --> 05:42.760]  Yeah, he loves it.
[05:45.680 --> 05:47.260]  He's walking to the director right now.
[05:50.720 --> 05:53.900]  They made him do this in the movie and he's about to call someone a slur.
[05:55.540 --> 05:58.780]  He thought this was Christmas Vacation 2 for the first two weeks.
[06:00.340 --> 06:02.200]  I don't think I've seen him in this era.
[06:03.540 --> 06:03.980]  Oh really?
[06:04.720 --> 06:09.920]  I feel like I go from Christmas Vacation to the more recent stuff.
[06:10.240 --> 06:11.360]  I'm sorry, is that Pam Grier?
[06:12.740 --> 06:19.920]  This would be in the era of like Cops and Robertsons and Vegas Vacation, I think.
[06:20.100 --> 06:20.260]  Oh man.
[06:20.780 --> 06:21.120]  Oh yeah.
[06:22.420 --> 06:24.220]  That's absolutely Pam Grier.
[06:24.800 --> 06:27.500]  From frickin' that Steven Seagal movie?
[06:27.900 --> 06:29.220]  Is that Bo Duke?
[06:29.920 --> 06:30.580]  It is.
[06:30.720 --> 06:32.340]  That is absolutely Bo Duke.
[06:33.180 --> 06:34.560]  This is insane.
[06:36.540 --> 06:37.420]  What'd you say Andrew?
[06:37.660 --> 06:37.960]  Ithaca.
[06:38.120 --> 06:38.720]  Who's Bo Duke?
[06:39.360 --> 06:41.280]  Bo and Luke Duke were the Duke boys.
[06:41.680 --> 06:43.020]  He's one of the Duke boys!
[06:43.520 --> 06:45.140]  From the Dukes of Hazzard.
[06:45.780 --> 06:49.700]  Pretty sure he's a Duke of Maga now, as I understand it.
[06:49.720 --> 06:51.160]  Is that Dan Castellaneta?
[06:52.340 --> 06:52.660]  No.
[06:53.960 --> 06:55.280]  I'm just trying to guess now.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.400]  That's Ken Weaver.
[07:02.670 --> 07:04.470]  Oh, I've seen him. Was he in Ozark?
[07:06.110 --> 07:06.930]  He might have been.
[07:07.330 --> 07:08.850]  Was he like the lawyer guy in Ozark?
[07:09.270 --> 07:10.970]  Oh, it's Drake or Josh.
[07:11.330 --> 07:12.130]  It's Josh.
[07:12.990 --> 07:15.690]  I don't know which one it is. My kid watched that shit a lot.
[07:16.130 --> 07:16.290]  Yeah.
[07:20.410 --> 07:22.170]  He's doing his best Jim Carrey right here.
[07:27.480 --> 07:29.340]  He's really chewing the scenery here, bud.
[07:29.920 --> 07:31.340]  Oh, this is grounded in reality.
[07:32.120 --> 07:32.960]  Uh-huh.
[07:39.270 --> 07:39.670]  God.
[07:39.750 --> 07:40.290]  Nerds, dude.
[07:41.350 --> 07:44.070]  Was this movie funded by math?
[07:46.090 --> 07:46.490]  Yeah.
[07:47.670 --> 07:48.670]  Fucking big math.
[07:48.850 --> 07:51.270]  Like the math council was like, we gotta get cool.
[07:52.030 --> 07:53.950]  How do we do it? Nickelodeon kids movies.
[07:56.070 --> 07:58.650]  It's all the food pyramid. We gotta get back on the top.
[07:59.790 --> 08:00.090]  Yeah.
[08:03.360 --> 08:06.280]  We're getting blitzed by this milk-it-does-a-body-good bullshit.
[08:07.060 --> 08:07.400]  Yeah.
[08:08.600 --> 08:15.500]  What I think is interesting is the whole hook of this movie is having a snow day so you don't have to go to school, but I feel like that doesn't exist anymore.
[08:15.500 --> 08:17.200]  With, like, remote learning.
[08:17.840 --> 08:20.520]  Do you just learn from home if you don't go to school?
[08:20.840 --> 08:23.580]  I feel like they have the infrastructure now to just do that.
[08:23.760 --> 08:25.540]  You think people can pivot on the spot to that?
[08:25.940 --> 08:26.500]  I don't know.
[08:26.500 --> 08:29.560]  I feel like Nick would not... well, I guess your kid's not quite old enough.
[08:29.560 --> 08:33.820]  I think... I would think that once they dismantle that shit, it doesn't come back.
[08:34.140 --> 08:43.580]  Like, my kid, you know, she was... her entire freshman year was work from home, and that school had no desire to go back to that after.
[08:43.580 --> 08:48.540]  I would imagine that they were probably just... teachers probably want the snow day as badly as the students.
[08:49.580 --> 09:05.680]  They went so hard on doing, you know, online resources and things, and utilizing that as opposed to, like, physical paper and things of that nature, that they were doing midterms this past week and the district lost power.
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.320]  And, turns out, they weren't able to do the tests because they had no power to run the computers.
[09:14.200 --> 09:18.900]  Who is this kid? What's he been in? Is he somebody as a grown-up?
[09:19.540 --> 09:23.120]  He's been in a lot of stuff, but I don't know what you would necessarily recognize.
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.780]  He's a real 90s, early 2000s looking kid.
[09:27.700 --> 09:30.300]  His fucking voice is super familiar to me.
[09:30.920 --> 09:31.280]  Green Room.
[09:32.900 --> 09:34.240]  He was in Green Room!
[09:35.500 --> 09:38.440]  And Scott Pilgrim. I mean, you wouldn't know him from that, but that's...
[09:39.300 --> 09:40.640]  Probably Green Room is what I would know him from.
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.460]  Yeah. He's, like, the friend in Scott Pilgrim.
[09:47.280 --> 09:48.440]  Oh. Yep.
[09:50.760 --> 09:57.520]  Who is named Stephen Stills. I forgot that that's what Scott Pilgrim's like. It's just referencing things that you learn about when you're 22.
[09:59.900 --> 10:00.340]  Slums!
[10:01.260 --> 10:03.380]  You think you're the first person that discovered it.
[10:03.800 --> 10:09.520]  Yeah, and then you read Scott Pilgrim and it gives you all the references on a silver platter and it becomes your favorite thing. It's awesome.
[10:09.520 --> 10:09.840]  Yeah.
[10:10.900 --> 10:11.960]  Dude, look at that hat.
[10:15.220 --> 10:17.280]  I'm gonna start looking like this again.
[10:17.940 --> 10:18.740]  Please don't.
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.500]  I'm gonna get a step haircut. I'm gonna bleach it. I'm gonna get a black leather jacket and a bright-ass yellow car. This rocks.
[10:24.820 --> 10:28.220]  It looks like kind of a bowl cut on the back somehow, but not the front.
[10:29.380 --> 10:29.920]  Back bowl.
[10:31.440 --> 10:34.280]  I could be wrong, but I think he was in Final Destination.
[10:34.760 --> 10:36.520]  He looks like a guy...
[10:36.520 --> 10:41.620]  I don't know if he is. He just looks like a guy who would be in Final Destination.
[10:42.400 --> 10:45.420]  How many Final Destination films are there?
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.480]  It's like six or seven.
[10:47.560 --> 10:49.040]  Six or seven, I think.
[10:49.340 --> 10:50.820]  There's like a considerable amount, yeah.
[10:51.080 --> 10:52.500]  I think Nick is way off as well.
[10:52.740 --> 10:54.380]  Nick said four with such confidence.
[10:54.680 --> 10:57.480]  Yeah, he made me completely shift.
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.080]  I thought four looped back to the beginning.
[10:59.080 --> 11:05.460]  I realized that I've only seen the first two and there's like five more or something to watch and they're still going.
[11:05.620 --> 11:08.740]  I'm gonna have like a Final Destination marathon.
[11:09.500 --> 11:10.720]  I think there's six.
[11:11.080 --> 11:12.360]  There's five.
[11:13.200 --> 11:14.900]  Get your shit together.
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.800]  Looking at it right now.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.660]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[11:20.020 --> 11:21.220]  Bloodlines is upcoming.
[11:21.460 --> 11:23.420]  Bloodlines comes out next year. Geoff, we'll go see Bloodlines, dude.
[11:23.860 --> 11:27.120]  Dude, I gotta watch one through five again real fast, but I'm down for it.
[11:27.120 --> 11:28.380]  Let me get out of it.
[11:28.480 --> 11:30.180]  It'll be like a regulation movie.
[11:30.940 --> 11:33.100]  What's the best death in a Final Destination?
[11:33.980 --> 11:34.420]  Well, I don't know.
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.860]  Kid sloughs in the tub and gets strangled via wire.
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.080]  I think it's being on the highway and the logs come out and everything.
[11:45.260 --> 11:47.960]  I feel like everyone feels that all the time when they're driving.
[11:48.720 --> 11:49.540]  Here especially.
[11:49.540 --> 11:56.600]  When I was in college, I had a professor who was a producer for Final Destination when it was coming out.
[11:56.720 --> 11:58.540]  The one that came out in like 2008 or 2009.
[11:59.540 --> 12:00.980]  And that was interesting.
[12:01.160 --> 12:04.200]  She would just kind of tell us about like, here's what we're in the middle of.
[12:04.440 --> 12:06.640]  And it's like, how do you have time to teach a class?
[12:08.960 --> 12:10.440]  Tell us how they died again, teacher.
[12:12.520 --> 12:15.900]  Oh my God, Tony Todd is going to be in Final Destination 6 probably.
[12:16.060 --> 12:18.060]  That's crazy. Where did I just see him?
[12:18.540 --> 12:19.180]  Indiana Jones.
[12:19.200 --> 12:23.100]  Oh, he was in Indiana Jones. He's like 7 feet tall in Indiana Jones. It's so weird.
[12:24.960 --> 12:25.620]  Oh yeah.
[12:27.860 --> 12:28.600]  He's the giant.
[12:28.720 --> 12:29.240]  Oh, it's...
[12:29.240 --> 12:30.020]  It kicks the shit out of me.
[12:31.540 --> 12:32.580]  She was on 24.
[12:34.300 --> 12:35.880]  She's in that show, Hacks, isn't she?
[12:36.400 --> 12:36.540]  Yes.
[12:36.540 --> 12:37.120]  Isn't that her new show?
[12:37.580 --> 12:37.860]  Yeah.
[12:39.920 --> 12:40.960]  She's on top of the world.
[12:41.980 --> 12:42.180]  Yep.
[12:42.900 --> 12:44.520]  She was in...
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.260]  She was in...
[12:47.420 --> 12:48.360]  The movie about...
[12:48.360 --> 12:49.340]  The TV show about the ladies.
[12:50.400 --> 12:51.800]  Boy, every mom had this haircut.
[12:51.800 --> 12:52.300]  Golden Girls.
[12:52.760 --> 12:53.060]  24.
[12:53.180 --> 12:53.880]  No, the other one.
[12:53.900 --> 12:54.340]  Desperate Housewives.
[12:56.900 --> 12:57.680]  Designing women.
[13:00.260 --> 13:00.500]  Yeah.
[13:00.780 --> 13:01.880]  Was she in Designing Women?
[13:02.440 --> 13:03.180]  Yeah, wasn't she?
[13:04.060 --> 13:04.420]  Oh.
[13:04.880 --> 13:05.640]  I don't remember...
[13:05.640 --> 13:08.520]  It was like her and Annie Potts and Delta Burke.
[13:09.060 --> 13:12.340]  Yeah, Jean Smart, Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, and Annie Potts.
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.220]  Wow.
[13:14.340 --> 13:15.620]  I just don't...
[13:15.620 --> 13:18.120]  Like, when I think of her, that's just not what I think of her from.
[13:18.260 --> 13:18.840]  That's interesting.
[13:19.480 --> 13:20.840]  What do you think of her from?
[13:21.260 --> 13:21.740]  I don't.
[13:21.860 --> 13:23.160]  She's just a TV actress.
[13:25.440 --> 13:27.580]  I'd send you the link, but we're in a different chat.
[13:27.620 --> 13:30.620]  Like, the mom from The Oblongs.
[13:30.860 --> 13:31.520]  Like, that's...
[13:31.520 --> 13:33.020]  When I hear her voice, that's what I hear.
[13:33.980 --> 13:36.480]  I don't like how close that bread is to the soup.
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.080]  He's keeping an eye on it.
[13:39.140 --> 13:40.740]  Yeah, just...
[13:40.740 --> 13:42.560]  So you're not a...
[13:43.320 --> 13:47.540]  You're not a dip-your-grilled-cheese-and-tomato-soup kind of guy, are you, Gavin?
[13:48.360 --> 13:50.880]  I can if it's in for, like, a second or less.
[13:51.020 --> 13:51.760]  I'm a quick dipper.
[13:52.480 --> 13:52.860]  Quick dip.
[13:53.020 --> 13:55.140]  Now, do you find value in that?
[13:55.240 --> 13:56.960]  If you quick dip like that, is it enjoyable?
[13:57.740 --> 13:58.100]  Yeah.
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.040]  Okay.
[13:59.260 --> 14:01.900]  But the way he's just left that one unattended, I could slough in at any point.
[14:01.900 --> 14:02.400]  Oh, yeah.
[14:02.420 --> 14:03.480]  It's right on the edge.
[14:03.680 --> 14:04.280]  Gotta be careful.
[14:04.280 --> 14:04.560]  Yeah.
[14:05.440 --> 14:07.160]  What is it that you like about it?
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.300]  Is it the danger that you could take it too far and ruin it, so you gotta, like, thread the needle?
[14:12.040 --> 14:14.180]  No, I'm not, like, edging my grilled cheese.
[14:14.520 --> 14:15.520]  It sounds like you might be.
[14:15.720 --> 14:17.280]  It sounds like that's what I've decided you're doing.
[14:17.280 --> 14:18.640]  Make sure my grilled cheese doesn't come.
[14:21.200 --> 14:21.460]  Oh!
[14:25.560 --> 14:25.940]  Waited!
[14:26.660 --> 14:27.040]  Waited!
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.060]  I caught Gavin doing that in his bedroom after his third date with Meg.
[14:34.580 --> 14:36.700]  Putting on his little anklet and listening to the song.
[14:36.920 --> 14:38.560]  That was a hairy foot shot.
[14:39.220 --> 14:40.380]  Nick going crazy.
[14:43.480 --> 14:44.960]  I'm sorry, I was thinking about Foreigner.
[14:45.880 --> 14:46.360]  Sure.
[14:53.480 --> 14:54.440]  So long.
[14:57.400 --> 14:58.560]  Foreigner's got some baggers.
[14:59.040 --> 14:59.580]  Yeah, dude.
[14:59.860 --> 15:00.920]  Nothing wrong with him, man.
[15:02.640 --> 15:03.100]  Well...
[15:03.100 --> 15:05.320]  Head games, hot-blooded, cold as ice.
[15:08.720 --> 15:11.900]  I got nothing but love for Foreigner.
[15:12.220 --> 15:12.740]  That was yesterday.
[15:13.340 --> 15:14.740]  I heard Trump was going to deport them.
[15:19.320 --> 15:21.080]  That guy in Craven should watch out, then.
[15:23.220 --> 15:25.080]  I heard from Eric that that movie's not good.
[15:26.280 --> 15:27.380]  He's absolutely right.
[15:27.520 --> 15:28.260]  Ask Nick.
[15:29.600 --> 15:32.560]  The best part about that movie was the pizza I ate during it.
[15:34.540 --> 15:35.780]  And the margarita.
[15:35.800 --> 15:40.640]  I feel like that would be the best part of most movies you watch, is whatever food you have with it.
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.180]  Yeah, but it's exceptionally true when you watch Craven the Hunter.
[15:46.120 --> 15:48.940]  That's a shame, because he's a cool character in the comic books.
[15:49.740 --> 15:54.020]  He is, but what if he was like a 30-year-old guy with abs?
[15:54.120 --> 15:57.460]  Have you considered that, instead of an interesting guy who hunts?
[15:57.460 --> 15:58.680]  I hadn't.
[15:58.800 --> 15:59.640]  Are the abs a cutoff?
[16:01.200 --> 16:03.680]  Yeah, dude, I was so soft the whole time.
[16:07.300 --> 16:08.880]  Anyway, 16 years earlier.
[16:10.260 --> 16:12.460]  Dude, that movie, it sucks. Craven sucks.
[16:17.230 --> 16:20.210]  Geoff, do you lament the time of diner culture?
[16:20.690 --> 16:23.530]  It doesn't feel like we're in a diner culture anymore.
[16:24.210 --> 16:24.430]  Nah.
[16:24.890 --> 16:27.890]  I think diner culture ended in 2000.
[16:29.370 --> 16:30.250]  This was it?
[16:30.690 --> 16:31.510]  Did Snow Day kill it?
[16:31.770 --> 16:31.990]  What was it replaced by?
[16:31.990 --> 16:33.510]  No, that's too early.
[16:33.610 --> 16:34.030]  I'm sorry.
[16:34.150 --> 16:34.690]  Let me think about that.
[16:34.790 --> 16:37.250]  Maybe 2006, diner culture started.
[16:38.110 --> 16:40.430]  Yeah, I mean, I was in high school and stuff.
[16:40.490 --> 16:41.330]  We would go to diner.
[16:41.430 --> 16:42.790]  Like, this is what we would do.
[16:43.930 --> 16:46.710]  Gus and I, or whoever, Jason, Bernie, whoever,
[16:46.750 --> 16:49.650]  we would always go, after we were drinking downtown or whatever,
[16:49.790 --> 16:53.530]  you would always go to, like, Starseeds or Magnolia or somewhere
[16:53.530 --> 16:56.050]  to, you know, sop up some sobriety.
[16:56.750 --> 16:57.010]  Yep.
[16:57.410 --> 16:59.530]  Now there's so few, there's like none.
[16:59.730 --> 16:59.930]  Yeah.
[16:59.930 --> 17:02.450]  Well, there's hardly any 24-hour diners in Austin anymore.
[17:02.510 --> 17:04.070]  They used to be one in every fucking corner.
[17:04.610 --> 17:05.250]  Uh-huh.
[17:05.250 --> 17:06.870]  Is this first-generation Bucket Hat?
[17:07.790 --> 17:08.690]  Yeah, Starseeds is gone.
[17:09.390 --> 17:10.250]  Oh, they closed it?
[17:10.770 --> 17:13.090]  I thought they were just shutting down for the 35 expansion.
[17:13.090 --> 17:14.330]  No, dude, they're bulldozing it.
[17:14.370 --> 17:15.970]  They bulldoze the hotel around it, Starseeds.
[17:16.090 --> 17:18.130]  It might be gone by now.
[17:18.290 --> 17:19.930]  I drove by yesterday and it was...
[17:20.610 --> 17:22.210]  They're supposed to be moving it, I think.
[17:22.290 --> 17:23.930]  But then also, I don't believe...
[17:24.890 --> 17:27.450]  If it never came back, I'd be like, oh yeah, of course.
[17:28.010 --> 17:29.410]  Yeah, I don't think that place is coming back.
[17:29.410 --> 17:31.210]  And if it does, I don't know.
[17:32.190 --> 17:34.570]  You know, it's funny you mentioned 2006 is the year it died.
[17:34.630 --> 17:36.750]  Because that's the year I got here and started college.
[17:36.790 --> 17:40.630]  And it was when I started getting to experience diners more on my own.
[17:41.370 --> 17:42.650]  In a new place.
[17:43.370 --> 17:45.430]  And you're right, after that, everything...
[17:45.430 --> 17:50.070]  They had the original Kirby Lane by the campus that had all that old interior that was shitty.
[17:50.690 --> 17:52.590]  And it was hodgepodge of stuff.
[17:52.930 --> 17:53.850]  That building's a piece of shit.
[17:54.470 --> 17:57.070]  Yeah, but it was a fun piece of shit.
[17:57.070 --> 17:59.350]  It's even like... I mean, I know...
[17:59.350 --> 18:02.670]  Obviously there are people that are listening to this and think we're ridiculous
[18:02.670 --> 18:04.270]  because they go to diners at night all the time.
[18:04.330 --> 18:06.750]  But I do think that there's something that has changed about it.
[18:06.870 --> 18:11.370]  Because A, a lot of those diners stopped being 24 hours a day because they weren't full anymore.
[18:11.890 --> 18:17.090]  And then, even in 2004, if you would go downtown at 2.30 in the morning,
[18:17.190 --> 18:19.130]  the IHOP right there at Cesar Chavez,
[18:19.430 --> 18:20.870]  there'd be a line out the door.
[18:21.050 --> 18:23.070]  That's not necessarily the case anymore.
[18:24.590 --> 18:25.910]  What do you think the fakes know us?
[18:27.270 --> 18:28.770]  What do you think they're doing here?
[18:29.250 --> 18:30.430]  Hopefully not asbestos.
[18:31.370 --> 18:32.590]  Wizard of Oz style?
[18:33.850 --> 18:36.110]  This is the beginnings of mesothelioma.
[18:37.430 --> 18:40.690]  We're getting so many shots of this girl with her tongue out.
[18:45.940 --> 18:47.260]  I hate it.
[18:49.220 --> 18:52.520]  There's a guy in this that they showed a couple of times.
[18:52.580 --> 18:54.360]  He's wearing a big floppy hat.
[18:55.680 --> 18:58.600]  Gavin, if I bleach my hair and do it like that other guy,
[18:58.660 --> 19:01.600]  will you just start wearing a floppy hat for as long as I have the bleached hair?
[19:06.560 --> 19:07.360]  How bleached?
[19:09.800 --> 19:10.860]  He's doing the bleaching.
[19:11.880 --> 19:15.940]  I just don't want it to be a bleach that you can get away with every day.
[19:16.400 --> 19:18.000]  I want it to be a horrific bleach.
[19:19.940 --> 19:24.880]  I think bleached hair at all right now is going to be a horrific bleach.
[19:25.080 --> 19:28.140]  It's not cool. And I'm almost 40.
[19:29.280 --> 19:30.680]  I'll wear the hat next to that.
[19:37.040 --> 19:42.400]  Do you think by this point, when the person put Chevy Chase in that shirt,
[19:42.460 --> 19:43.360]  they already hated him?
[19:44.020 --> 19:44.500]  Absolutely.
[19:45.760 --> 19:48.280]  That was a decision, right? That was like, this motherfucker.
[19:48.580 --> 19:49.260]  Alright, fine.
[19:49.260 --> 19:53.340]  What if he was really nice before this movie and this movie changed him?
[19:53.620 --> 19:56.760]  I mean, I know that's not the case, but what if?
[19:57.480 --> 19:59.760]  Yeah, he's just saying more whimsical, warmer whimsical.
[20:00.020 --> 20:02.100]  And the prop guy's like, fuck you.
[20:02.260 --> 20:04.020]  And then after that, he had a really bad attitude.
[20:04.220 --> 20:06.980]  I thought it was a shirt. It's an old-timey bathing suit.
[20:14.320 --> 20:15.740]  When did they go away?
[20:17.240 --> 20:19.620]  Yeah, when did we stop wearing old-timey bathing suits?
[20:20.380 --> 20:22.800]  Because I think we should bring one back to the store.
[20:23.220 --> 20:25.980]  I'm going to do bleached hair and an old-timey bathing suit.
[20:26.080 --> 20:28.460]  Gavin's going to wear his floppy hat. This is great.
[20:29.020 --> 20:32.060]  Beastie Bacon in the comments said, when we got new-timey.
[20:40.380 --> 20:41.380]  That tickled me.
[20:47.170 --> 20:49.410]  So there's no magic to the snow day.
[20:49.550 --> 20:53.750]  They didn't wish upon a star or a teddy bear or anything.
[20:54.030 --> 20:56.790]  She wished upon a snow globe. She wanted it.
[20:56.790 --> 21:00.090]  I think it's magic in the same way The Secret is magic.
[21:00.470 --> 21:03.410]  She definitely vocalized it.
[21:05.410 --> 21:08.010]  Get pelted, get pelted, get pelted, get pelted, get pelted.
[21:10.590 --> 21:13.050]  So this whole movie is based around snow.
[21:15.230 --> 21:19.170]  What part of snow day did you think was deceiving?
[21:19.770 --> 21:22.090]  No, I just mean they've used a lot of fake snow so far.
[21:24.860 --> 21:27.740]  Like, couldn't they have just... did they film it somewhere snowy?
[21:30.200 --> 21:33.260]  It does not... I bet they didn't.
[21:33.460 --> 21:36.160]  Right, which is mental for a movie based around snow.
[21:43.600 --> 21:45.040]  I was going to laugh like that.
[21:47.040 --> 21:48.080]  Never mind.
[21:58.940 --> 22:01.940]  Goldie Hawn went to the premiere of Snow Day?
[22:02.740 --> 22:06.440]  Is her kid in it or something? Is Wyatt Russell in this movie?
[22:06.440 --> 22:11.360]  That's not Goldie Hawn, it's just somebody that looked like her in a small picture.
[22:11.820 --> 22:13.000]  But Corbin Bernson did.
[22:14.260 --> 22:15.220]  Oh, Corbin Bernson?
[22:16.740 --> 22:21.940]  Man, the stack of pancakes that Josh just passed out next to looks so good.
[22:24.460 --> 22:26.440]  I know where the movie was filmed.
[22:27.180 --> 22:27.680]  Where was it filmed?
[22:29.120 --> 22:30.020]  Anybody want to take any guesses?
[22:31.580 --> 22:31.880]  California.
[22:31.880 --> 22:36.060]  I'll say upstate New York just to keep with where it is.
[22:38.660 --> 22:39.720]  I'll agree with Eric.
[22:40.860 --> 22:41.380]  LA.
[22:43.100 --> 22:48.340]  The 2000 movie Snow Day was filmed in Edmonton and Calgary as well as New York.
[22:48.580 --> 22:49.680]  So Eric, you get partial credit.
[22:50.540 --> 22:51.360]  That's real snow?
[22:51.720 --> 22:52.840]  That's incredible.
[22:55.160 --> 22:55.560]  Damn.
[23:00.970 --> 23:05.530]  This narration is supposed to be like Christmas story-esque, I guess.
[23:07.130 --> 23:08.010]  Yeah, I think so.
[23:09.310 --> 23:10.270]  There he is.
[23:10.850 --> 23:12.770]  I don't know that I've seen him with a beard really before.
[23:14.750 --> 23:16.170]  We should watch Cabin Boy.
[23:17.710 --> 23:18.350]  Oh man.
[23:33.150 --> 23:34.270]  His bird?
[23:34.650 --> 23:35.230]  Oh my god.
[23:36.450 --> 23:39.530]  That's like the most evil looking bird you can have too.
[23:40.050 --> 23:41.130]  What was that?
[23:42.350 --> 23:43.390]  Like a raven?
[23:43.610 --> 23:44.610]  Yeah, like a raven it seemed.
[23:45.090 --> 23:46.510]  Is that what a raven looks like?
[23:46.870 --> 23:48.330]  Dude, ravens are huge.
[23:51.250 --> 23:54.650]  What kind of bird is in Snow Day?
[23:55.110 --> 23:56.330]  That could be us and Snow Runners.
[23:56.810 --> 23:58.130]  A lot of people are saying that's a magpie.
[24:01.020 --> 24:02.440]  But they could all see each other.
[24:03.680 --> 24:04.260]  That's true.
[24:06.180 --> 24:08.780]  Trudy is a white snowbird? That bird was black.
[24:08.780 --> 24:09.780]  Oh, it's a pied crow.
[24:11.420 --> 24:11.940]  Pied?
[24:12.160 --> 24:13.460]  Pied crow.
[24:15.380 --> 24:16.540]  P-I-E-D.
[24:17.100 --> 24:17.640]  Pied crow.
[24:19.700 --> 24:20.740]  That means...
[24:20.740 --> 24:22.180]  What does pied mean?
[24:23.380 --> 24:23.820]  Bonner?
[24:25.800 --> 24:26.320]  Corvus?
[24:26.320 --> 24:27.060]  Matt Bonner?
[24:27.620 --> 24:30.140]  I was scared. I didn't want to say it because I thought I'd be stupid.
[24:31.040 --> 24:31.260]  What?
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.200]  It means two or more colors.
[24:34.260 --> 24:34.440]  Oh.
[24:35.960 --> 24:37.940]  I don't think I've ever heard that term before.
[24:38.260 --> 24:40.180]  Was the pied piper two colors?
[24:44.940 --> 24:47.800]  That would be so cool.
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.620]  His thing that they don't talk about is he's two colored.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.560]  But his name, that's nuts.
[24:59.450 --> 25:01.650]  He's like silver and black like the Raiders.
[25:02.110 --> 25:02.370]  Yeah.
[25:07.650 --> 25:08.490]  There's Andrew.
[25:09.050 --> 25:12.230]  Is this kid like an idiot or what's going on?
[25:13.770 --> 25:15.410]  He really likes ice in his shoes.
[25:19.850 --> 25:21.430]  I'm going to get Geoff that troll doll.
[25:22.050 --> 25:24.430]  He's surely going to go flying when she puts a foot down.
[25:24.990 --> 25:26.570]  You know what I don't ever see?
[25:27.370 --> 25:28.930]  Trolls when we go to bingo.
[25:28.930 --> 25:35.030]  In the movies or when it's referenced or TV shows people are always putting their trolls out for luck.
[25:35.130 --> 25:37.850]  We go to bingo all the time. I've never actually seen that.
[25:37.930 --> 25:40.510]  And I've seen some rough looking people at bingo.
[25:42.150 --> 25:43.150]  I've never heard of that.
[25:44.150 --> 25:45.610]  Yeah, it's like a good luck thing.
[25:49.210 --> 25:51.010]  I can't believe that garage door opened.
[25:54.530 --> 25:58.010]  That was my dream as a kid to open the garage and it would be filled with snow.
[25:58.010 --> 25:59.230]  On the other side.
[26:01.010 --> 26:01.930]  Never snowed that much.
[26:02.150 --> 26:02.530]  What would you do? Dive in?
[26:03.110 --> 26:03.830]  Oh, I would, yeah.
[26:12.410 --> 26:13.230]  Oh my god.
[26:14.910 --> 26:16.230]  Holy Caulfield ass.
[26:16.610 --> 26:21.730]  I was about to say, I don't know if his mom or his dad bought him the thesaurus for Christmas.
[26:21.850 --> 26:24.130]  But I hope they fucking regret it.
[26:24.730 --> 26:27.910]  And as I walked around the city I saw a bunch of phonies.
[26:28.110 --> 26:28.830]  Alright, go to hell.
[26:35.460 --> 26:39.520]  You strike me as the kind of person who wasn't a big fan of Catcher in the Rye, Andrew, or Eric.
[26:40.180 --> 26:45.000]  Oh, I hated it. Reading it in high school, I was just like, guys, we cannot keep reading this book.
[26:45.080 --> 26:46.020]  This is miserable.
[26:46.580 --> 26:47.820]  I don't think we read that one.
[26:48.040 --> 26:51.420]  God, I hated it. I read it freshman year. I hated it so much.
[26:51.740 --> 26:52.300]  Fucking loved it.
[26:56.210 --> 26:57.270]  That doesn't surprise me.
[27:00.550 --> 27:02.350]  Yeah, I guess we are who we appear to be.
[27:02.350 --> 27:04.870]  Yeah, I think we're pretty...
[27:05.930 --> 27:08.570]  Not as deep as we assume we are.
[27:10.430 --> 27:11.450]  Pretty surface level.
[27:13.970 --> 27:16.270]  I'm not buying the snow on the roof of the house next door.
[27:32.540 --> 27:34.580]  Dude, you got some nice houses up in Canada, Andrew.
[27:35.000 --> 27:35.460]  Yeah, dude.
[27:45.840 --> 27:47.780]  Yeah, I don't know if this is Edmonton or...
[27:47.780 --> 27:50.180]  Calgary? Probably Edmonton, I'd assume.
[27:50.800 --> 27:52.160]  Did you live in a house like this?
[27:52.820 --> 27:53.180]  No.
[27:55.380 --> 27:56.600]  What the fuck?
[27:57.700 --> 27:58.940]  He invented rough, Nick.
[27:59.880 --> 28:01.200]  I don't... okay.
[28:03.460 --> 28:05.080]  You should never shout that at kids.
[28:05.740 --> 28:09.720]  No. I think that was my primary problem with him saying it.
[28:17.800 --> 28:19.940]  Million dollars, but...
[28:25.490 --> 28:25.950]  Snowballs, man.
[28:25.950 --> 28:26.890]  The crew had a fun day that day.
[28:28.190 --> 28:29.770]  Just being in the main cast.
[28:45.860 --> 28:48.020]  I like everything about this movie except for the main character.
[28:58.140 --> 29:00.400]  He didn't like Empire Records, right? Right, Geoff?
[29:00.780 --> 29:02.100]  No, I hated that fucking movie.
[29:02.960 --> 29:05.000]  I hated it when it came out in the theater.
[29:05.300 --> 29:06.960]  I hated it when all my friends liked it.
[29:07.180 --> 29:09.440]  I hated it when everybody wanted to watch it at a fucking party.
[29:09.580 --> 29:10.940]  I hated it when my first wife liked it.
[29:10.980 --> 29:12.440]  I hated it when my second wife liked it.
[29:12.440 --> 29:14.800]  If my third wife likes it, I'll fucking hate it again.
[29:15.500 --> 29:16.600]  Which one is that one?
[29:17.700 --> 29:20.720]  It's from 90... I'm going to say 95.
[29:21.260 --> 29:22.120]  Is that the Lynn Tyler one?
[29:22.200 --> 29:22.820]  Yes, it is.
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.260]  It's the most insufferable fucking film.
[29:27.940 --> 29:29.140]  My wife showed that movie to me.
[29:29.940 --> 29:33.440]  It was such a movie that I saw when I was like 10 years old and I went,
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.360]  Oh my God, anything's possible.
[29:36.240 --> 29:37.740]  And then you watch it now and you go,
[29:37.940 --> 29:39.160]  This movie sucks.
[29:39.580 --> 29:41.940]  I saw it when I was 28, so I had a much different view.
[29:42.460 --> 29:45.160]  Arrest the idiot and put him in jail. Movie over.
[29:45.360 --> 29:47.000]  He stole the money. He went to Vegas.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.260]  Then we are done. The end. Goodbye.
[29:48.920 --> 29:53.380]  We don't dig him out of the fucking hole he put Anthony LaPaglia in.
[29:56.820 --> 29:58.040]  I just thought it was so great.
[29:58.100 --> 30:00.920]  There's so many different characters and everyone's like a little stereotype thing.
[30:01.020 --> 30:02.140]  And you're just like, this is great.
[30:02.240 --> 30:03.720]  And then you watch it now and you go,
[30:03.800 --> 30:05.720]  Everyone's a fucking stereotype thing. This sucks.
[30:05.760 --> 30:08.580]  And you're like, oh, this is what it must be like to work at a record shop.
[30:08.580 --> 30:15.540]  Well, it's open and there's more than one person there.
[30:23.320 --> 30:25.560]  Have you been checking the driveways, Gavin, to see if anyone's dead?
[30:31.420 --> 30:32.920]  Whoa. Holy shit.
[30:32.980 --> 30:34.100]  That's so fucking cool.
[30:34.900 --> 30:35.820]  That is cool.
[30:37.720 --> 30:39.440]  How'd they get the power room in here?
[30:43.280 --> 30:44.800]  Josh Peck looks genuinely ill.
[30:46.240 --> 30:48.000]  That's which one it is? Josh Peck?
[30:48.620 --> 30:48.720]  Yeah.
[30:48.760 --> 30:52.400]  Did he have like a studio deal where he just got to be in everything?
[30:52.660 --> 30:53.880]  Dude, yes. He was like...
[30:53.880 --> 30:54.280]  Nickelodeon guy.
[30:55.060 --> 30:58.340]  They just rode that kid for as long as they could. Crazy.
[30:58.800 --> 31:00.920]  What's he doing now? Didn't he do one grown-up movie?
[31:01.620 --> 31:03.400]  No, he's in like a lot of stuff.
[31:05.220 --> 31:06.680]  He was in The Wackness.
[31:07.180 --> 31:08.900]  That's what I was thinking of. The Wackness.
[31:09.260 --> 31:09.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:10.020 --> 31:10.840]  That's what I was thinking of.
[31:11.280 --> 31:11.600]  Yeah.
[31:12.540 --> 31:13.800]  I mean, he's probably just...
[31:15.580 --> 31:18.580]  Did he get real Dan Schneider back in the day?
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.180]  I don't know what that means.
[31:21.440 --> 31:25.800]  I mean like probably, but I don't know if he was in that thing.
[31:26.020 --> 31:26.220]  No.
[31:26.440 --> 31:29.380]  He was in all that, so that was a Dan Schneider thing.
[31:30.620 --> 31:32.680]  Oh, Drake did, according to chat.
[31:33.940 --> 31:34.260]  Rough.
[31:35.760 --> 31:36.900]  He was in Oppenheimer.
[31:38.280 --> 31:38.600]  He was?
[31:38.600 --> 31:39.600]  Which one? Josh Peck?
[31:40.100 --> 31:40.320]  Yeah.
[31:40.640 --> 31:40.940]  Oh.
[31:41.380 --> 31:41.720]  What?
[31:41.720 --> 31:42.980]  Yeah, he was in the explosion.
[31:43.680 --> 31:43.840]  Yeah.
[31:44.540 --> 31:46.180]  Oh, I had something like that as a kid.
[31:46.300 --> 31:48.600]  Dude, periscopes were the shit when I was a kid.
[31:48.600 --> 31:48.920]  They were so cool.
[31:49.160 --> 31:49.360]  I loved them.
[31:50.000 --> 31:50.980]  I don't think I ever owned one.
[31:52.180 --> 31:54.460]  And they worked the other way too. So cool.
[31:55.980 --> 31:57.780]  Did you get to use one in the army?
[31:58.860 --> 32:00.180]  No, I was in the army, not the navy.
[32:00.920 --> 32:01.180]  Yeah.
[32:05.140 --> 32:06.220]  He had to dig a foxhole.
[32:06.380 --> 32:06.600]  Yeah.
[32:08.540 --> 32:10.140]  How big can a periscope be?
[32:11.020 --> 32:14.600]  If I wanted to see something, my drill sergeant would just say,
[32:14.720 --> 32:16.260]  Open your eyes, jackass.
[32:17.820 --> 32:19.560]  And that's the word he would use, right?
[32:19.740 --> 32:19.760]  I heard that a lot.
[32:19.760 --> 32:21.200]  He would use jackass?
[32:21.280 --> 32:23.400]  No, that is a direct quote.
[32:24.140 --> 32:26.880]  I mean, he would use other words that I can't say on the podcast,
[32:27.220 --> 32:29.780]  but in this instance, this is a direct quote.
[32:29.920 --> 32:30.900]  Open your eyes, jackass.
[32:32.340 --> 32:34.700]  Do you think that was a snow donut or a snow bagel?
[32:36.640 --> 32:37.580]  Great question, Ian.
[32:37.780 --> 32:38.600]  That's a great question.
[32:38.600 --> 32:39.600]  Is that suitable?
[32:49.240 --> 32:53.280]  Snow always looked real nice until traffic had gone through it, you know?
[32:53.300 --> 32:55.680]  Oh, yeah. It looks so gross after that.
[32:55.840 --> 32:57.580]  I don't know.
[32:57.980 --> 32:59.860]  I don't know at all.
[33:00.080 --> 33:02.680]  Chad says Josh Peck is cute as fuck now.
[33:03.540 --> 33:03.900]  Oh, really?
[33:04.040 --> 33:04.380]  Good to know.
[33:04.640 --> 33:05.140]  Hell yeah.
[33:05.520 --> 33:09.840]  I think he's like the main love interest in How I Met Your Father with Hilary Duff.
[33:09.980 --> 33:10.680]  I don't know what that is.
[33:10.920 --> 33:12.500]  I forgot about that show.
[33:12.620 --> 33:13.140]  Everyone did.
[33:14.280 --> 33:15.740]  Is it related in any way?
[33:16.720 --> 33:17.600]  Oh, I have no idea.
[33:17.960 --> 33:18.880]  I didn't watch it.
[33:18.920 --> 33:19.720]  I just know about it.
[33:20.420 --> 33:24.040]  I watched like the first episode and I was like, this is some shit.
[33:24.380 --> 33:26.000]  I feel like it's on Hulu and I don't have Hulu.
[33:27.620 --> 33:30.780]  I only have Hulu because it's part of the Disney ESPN Plus package.
[33:36.480 --> 33:38.380]  Alright, 57-54 at the half.
[33:39.380 --> 33:40.320]  You think his bud's dead?
[33:41.600 --> 33:42.560]  It's gonna fly out.
[33:42.800 --> 33:44.800]  Oh, it should have flown out right there.
[33:45.140 --> 33:47.380]  It should have flown out the top and started attacking the kids.
[33:49.200 --> 33:50.160]  Geoff, who are they playing?
[33:51.140 --> 33:51.620]  Bulls.
[33:52.580 --> 33:54.380]  I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
[33:55.220 --> 33:56.100]  Spurs are playing the Hawks.
[33:56.340 --> 33:56.920]  I mean...
[33:57.740 --> 33:58.700]  Are they in Atlanta?
[33:59.880 --> 34:00.800]  That guy had his dick out!
[34:01.380 --> 34:05.340]  He had his Josh Pecker out.
[34:11.680 --> 34:13.860]  Yeah, stay on the porch!
[34:14.960 --> 34:17.260]  Actually, this guy's not just doing his job.
[34:18.340 --> 34:20.820]  Okay, well listen, I saw five minutes of it.
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.360]  He's looking at a kid's ass while he's chasing him.
[34:24.560 --> 34:27.560]  To be fair, to this point, all he's done is plow roads.
[34:28.640 --> 34:31.080]  This is an evil bird. I love his evil bird.
[34:31.380 --> 34:34.100]  They built this whole tunnel system today, right?
[34:34.540 --> 34:34.760]  Yeah.
[34:36.500 --> 34:37.300]  They're skilled.
[34:40.080 --> 34:42.480]  You know a kid would give up 10 seconds into that.
[34:42.880 --> 34:43.660]  Nice fart.
[34:44.880 --> 34:45.780]  Fill up a balloon.
[34:49.310 --> 34:50.030]  Oh no!
[34:50.310 --> 34:51.030]  Not the CRT!
[34:53.290 --> 34:54.430]  Mom's gonna be pissed.
[34:57.760 --> 34:58.460]  How's the bird?
[34:59.060 --> 34:59.740]  Yeah, it's evil!
[35:00.520 --> 35:05.120]  I will say, I guess from his perspective, he just murdered three kids and is pretty okay about it.
[35:05.240 --> 35:05.800]  Yeah, he's fine with it.
[35:09.820 --> 35:11.720]  Why did they build the fort in the road?
[35:12.000 --> 35:12.460]  That's a good question.
[35:12.480 --> 35:13.220]  Is that Chili?
[35:18.700 --> 35:20.340]  It's Chili from TLC.
[35:20.820 --> 35:21.280]  Is it?
[35:21.920 --> 35:22.360]  Yes.
[35:23.740 --> 35:24.940]  Isn't she dead?
[35:25.660 --> 35:26.600]  No, that's Lisa Lopez.
[35:26.940 --> 35:27.780]  No, that's Lisa Left Eye.
[35:28.280 --> 35:30.100]  Remember, she was in like a bunch of movies.
[35:30.260 --> 35:30.900]  Isn't she in like...
[35:30.900 --> 35:30.960]  You're right.
[35:30.960 --> 35:33.180]  I know she did that summer, Scream or some stuff.
[35:33.240 --> 35:34.160]  She's in like stuff.
[35:34.540 --> 35:36.480]  I think maybe Scream 3.
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.460]  There were like probably like half a decade where it's like, she's gonna be an actor now.
[35:43.060 --> 35:45.820]  Well, it was her and Kelly Rowland was doing the same stuff around the same time.
[35:45.940 --> 35:48.080]  She was in Freddy vs. Jason, I think.
[35:49.020 --> 35:49.320]  Yep.
[35:53.460 --> 35:55.980]  Oh my god, my son talks just like this.
[35:58.160 --> 36:00.660]  Does he slam his head into the wall in a lunchbox?
[36:01.580 --> 36:02.940]  I fucking hope not.
[36:03.100 --> 36:04.480]  Hand him a lunchbox, let's find out.
[36:05.600 --> 36:08.000]  He'll be like, what's this? Smash, smash, smash.
[36:08.100 --> 36:09.760]  It's one of the movies she's known for.
[36:10.580 --> 36:11.240]  What is?
[36:11.580 --> 36:11.960]  Snow Day.
[36:13.380 --> 36:13.920]  Who, Chili?
[36:14.420 --> 36:14.660]  Yeah.
[36:15.320 --> 36:15.820]  Oh, bummer.
[36:16.480 --> 36:16.860]  It's highlighted.
[36:17.100 --> 36:18.320]  What was the third one in TLC?
[36:19.620 --> 36:19.960]  T-Bone.
[36:20.400 --> 36:20.780]  T-Boz.
[36:20.820 --> 36:21.280]  T-Boz.
[36:21.440 --> 36:22.440]  T-Boz.
[36:22.520 --> 36:25.640]  T-Boz, Left Eye and Chili.
[36:27.880 --> 36:29.780]  Their names made up TLC?
[36:30.500 --> 36:30.560]  Yeah.
[36:31.240 --> 36:31.800]  Crazy.
[36:32.040 --> 36:32.200]  What?
[36:33.060 --> 36:33.520]  Really?
[36:33.780 --> 36:34.720]  That's what TLC was, yeah.
[36:35.220 --> 36:35.420]  Yeah.
[36:35.820 --> 36:36.200]  Wow.
[36:37.520 --> 36:40.240]  Are you learning that for the first time right now?
[36:41.300 --> 36:42.040]  Yeah, I am.
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.580]  I thought that was very common knowledge.
[36:46.820 --> 36:48.620]  Maybe we're just a little older.
[36:49.260 --> 36:53.280]  I mean, I had Crazy Sexy Cool on cassette, so yeah, definitely.
[36:55.260 --> 36:56.520]  Did they have a logo?
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.600]  I imagine it would be a T and an L within a C, but I don't remember.
[37:03.520 --> 37:06.340]  I wonder if we could do an aneg one in the style of the TLC logo.
[37:06.700 --> 37:07.600]  Oh, that's cool.
[37:08.620 --> 37:09.340]  Not real...
[37:09.340 --> 37:13.740]  Okay, so there is one that I sort of remember where it is just...
[37:13.740 --> 37:15.560]  I guess I could put it in...
[37:15.560 --> 37:17.040]  I can put it in this, I guess.
[37:17.160 --> 37:20.000]  If you search for TLC logo, you get the TLC TV show.
[37:21.260 --> 37:22.660]  I just put it in chat.
[37:22.660 --> 37:28.040]  That's what I mostly remember is the TLC with the boxes around it.
[37:28.820 --> 37:32.280]  I don't know why we would want to do that, but we could, yes.
[37:32.280 --> 37:32.940]  That looks real ugly.
[37:33.780 --> 37:34.540]  That's hideous.
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.540]  The principal reminds me of the dad from Modern Family.
[37:46.820 --> 37:48.120]  Is it a chin?
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.400]  Yeah, I think it's the chin and the dark hair, I think.
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.240]  Is that a Liza Dooshku?
[37:54.240 --> 37:55.240]  No.
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.520]  It looks like a Sloane from Entourage.
[37:57.980 --> 37:59.260]  It is Sloane from Entourage.
[37:59.600 --> 38:02.420]  And there are so many people brushing their teeth in this movie.
[38:04.200 --> 38:05.100]  Huh, that's weird.
[38:05.320 --> 38:06.440]  I've never seen Entourage.
[38:07.840 --> 38:07.980]  What?
[38:08.280 --> 38:10.660]  But what about the beginning where he goes, oh yeah!
[38:11.500 --> 38:12.360]  No, I don't know what that is.
[38:13.020 --> 38:14.600]  I wanna be your superhero!
[38:16.480 --> 38:17.520]  Emmanuelle Chiriqui.
[38:18.980 --> 38:19.260]  Is that her?
[38:19.840 --> 38:21.900]  Is that the actress's name?
[38:22.160 --> 38:23.100]  Yeah, Sloane.
[38:24.240 --> 38:25.580]  I'm just trying to see if I've seen her in anything else.
[38:26.100 --> 38:26.360]  Oh!
[38:34.130 --> 38:35.930]  Holy shit, she's been in a lot of stuff.
[38:37.710 --> 38:38.730]  Working actress, baby!
[38:39.230 --> 38:40.770]  Oh, wow, she was in Defender Rock City.
[38:40.990 --> 38:42.570]  You can have an Eric Badour House of Pain, Eric, when you bleach your hair.
[38:43.370 --> 38:44.330]  Hell, goddamn right!
[38:45.950 --> 38:48.130]  And then Gavin puts on his floppy hat, that's awesome.
[38:48.730 --> 38:49.450]  Claire Bear.
[38:51.330 --> 38:52.770]  Hats really hurt my hair.
[38:53.010 --> 38:53.650]  I hate wearing them.
[38:54.050 --> 38:55.790]  No, this one's floppy, so maybe it's okay.
[38:55.950 --> 38:58.410]  Dude, she was in Call of Duty Black Ops.
[38:59.090 --> 38:59.530]  Cool!
[39:00.230 --> 39:01.130]  Yeah, she played a voice.
[39:01.910 --> 39:02.590]  That's cool.
[39:08.500 --> 39:14.080]  She strikes me as an actress who would be in 200 Cigarettes, but probably isn't in 200 Cigarettes.
[39:14.420 --> 39:15.200]  You know what I mean?
[39:15.380 --> 39:19.460]  I don't think the age works for when that movie came out, but I think I'm close.
[39:28.540 --> 39:29.320]  Fuck that.
[39:31.300 --> 39:32.920]  I don't think I've ever worn underwear pants.
[39:33.400 --> 39:33.960]  That's been me.
[39:34.760 --> 39:35.180]  Oh, yeah.
[39:35.180 --> 39:35.300]  Yeah.
[39:50.350 --> 39:52.470]  This guy sucks, he's awesome.
[39:52.810 --> 39:54.170]  I'm gonna dress like this.
[39:54.290 --> 39:56.130]  I'm gonna buy that shirt and that vest.
[39:56.290 --> 39:57.150]  This is awesome.
[39:58.890 --> 39:59.850]  This is...
[39:59.850 --> 40:04.890]  When I was in like 8th grade, that was how everyone looked on TV.
[40:09.430 --> 40:12.330]  This is really like a time machine here.
[40:12.650 --> 40:13.750]  This is a Nickelodeon movie, huh?
[40:14.350 --> 40:16.070]  I was about to say the same thing.
[40:17.010 --> 40:17.330]  You know.
[40:18.190 --> 40:19.770]  Somebody in the chat says she's 25.
[40:20.490 --> 40:21.810]  It's still a Nickelodeon movie, right?
[40:21.810 --> 40:23.210]  So she wouldn't have been in 200 Cigarettes.
[40:26.910 --> 40:29.850]  Still seems a little risque for Nickelodeon.
[40:30.290 --> 40:31.510]  Hello, hello.
[40:36.080 --> 40:37.760]  Well, Chubby Chase is in it, so you know.
[40:38.020 --> 40:38.240]  Yeah.
[40:39.800 --> 40:41.080]  Could go anywhere from here.
[40:45.300 --> 40:45.740]  Awesome.
[40:46.740 --> 40:51.680]  Where have we seen Chubby Chase go down a...
[40:51.680 --> 40:52.740]  Christmas vacation?
[40:53.360 --> 40:54.980]  No, it wasn't Christmas vacation.
[40:55.720 --> 40:57.120]  That was a bin lid, wasn't it?
[40:57.480 --> 40:57.960]  It was, yeah.
[40:57.980 --> 40:58.800]  I thought it was Christmas vacation.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.660]  I assume this is an homage.
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.620]  Is this Smash Mouth?
[41:05.200 --> 41:06.080]  Yeah, it sure is.
[41:07.900 --> 41:09.340]  Oh, you had this soundtrack, right?
[41:09.920 --> 41:10.260]  Mm-hmm.
[41:12.840 --> 41:14.360]  So this came out in 2000.
[41:14.580 --> 41:16.820]  So this is off of their hit album Astro Lounge,
[41:16.880 --> 41:19.340]  which is off their hit album, which is the sequel,
[41:19.420 --> 41:22.700]  the follow-up to the hit album Fush You Meng.
[41:23.780 --> 41:25.080]  Big Smash Mouth head, baby.
[41:26.120 --> 41:27.800]  Whoa, this is a ballsy move.
[41:27.940 --> 41:28.660]  She put more clothes on.
[41:28.940 --> 41:29.680]  That dude's dead, right?
[41:31.400 --> 41:32.660]  Is he? The guy from Smash Mouth?
[41:32.900 --> 41:33.900]  Yeah, didn't he just die?
[41:34.040 --> 41:34.360]  Yeah, the lead singer's dead.
[41:36.100 --> 41:36.820]  Oh, bummer.
[41:37.500 --> 41:37.980]  Oh, he did.
[41:38.020 --> 41:40.000]  Everyone threw bread at him and then he died or whatever, right?
[41:40.720 --> 41:42.320]  They threw bread at him?
[41:42.920 --> 41:43.020]  Yeah.
[41:44.120 --> 41:45.660]  Yeah, it was a little while ago.
[41:46.420 --> 41:46.640]  Yep.
[41:47.840 --> 41:50.920]  And then somethingawful.com told them to eat the eggs.
[41:52.880 --> 41:53.560]  I forgot.
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.760]  Smash Mouth, eat the eggs was the best.
[41:58.920 --> 42:00.900]  I made this advice article.
[42:01.240 --> 42:02.800]  I'm going to post a link to it.
[42:05.460 --> 42:06.620]  It's titled...
[42:07.360 --> 42:07.940]  What?
[42:08.840 --> 42:09.520]  Oh, man.
[42:10.260 --> 42:11.880]  The link goes to a different thing.
[42:11.940 --> 42:12.820]  It says, in the club, whatever.
[42:13.120 --> 42:15.960]  It's, I made the Smash Mouth guy eat a shit ton of eggs.
[42:18.820 --> 42:19.920]  Oh, that's so cool.
[42:35.490 --> 42:36.290]  Uh-oh.
[42:36.690 --> 42:37.510]  Oh, no.
[42:43.540 --> 42:44.300]  I'll kill you.
[42:45.760 --> 42:46.940]  That's what that dude looks like.
[42:48.780 --> 42:52.600]  The premise that you give a fuck who was at the storm first as a weather guy.
[42:52.600 --> 42:54.380]  I just want you to tell me what it's going to do.
[42:54.580 --> 43:00.320]  But, like, that's a, like, trope in things where people are, like, mad at the weather guy
[43:00.320 --> 43:03.200]  or the weather guy needs to be the most accurate or whatever.
[43:03.700 --> 43:06.580]  So, a very easy thing for, like, a sixth grader to understand.
[43:07.080 --> 43:08.360]  Wasn't that, like, a...
[43:08.360 --> 43:08.780]  Didn't that...
[43:08.780 --> 43:12.460]  Wasn't that the weather man plot with Nick Cage?
[43:12.820 --> 43:14.140]  He was, like, a single dad.
[43:14.420 --> 43:20.000]  Yeah, and then he kept trying to give a speech about how his dad reminds him of Bob Seger's
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  Like a Rock, I think.
[43:21.020 --> 43:21.260]  Yeah.
[43:21.260 --> 43:21.780]  Like, that's a movie?
[43:21.940 --> 43:22.380]  That's pretty good.
[43:23.560 --> 43:25.460]  You mean the Chevy car commercial in Texas?
[43:27.440 --> 43:28.600]  Oh, Like a Rock.
[43:32.850 --> 43:33.250]  This...
[43:34.050 --> 43:34.890]  This is weird.
[43:34.910 --> 43:38.410]  This movie from the year 2000 has all the hits of 1998.
[43:38.930 --> 43:40.430]  Yeah, this is...
[43:47.830 --> 43:49.830]  Do you think one of those is as fun as a jet ski?
[43:51.990 --> 43:52.790]  Uh, yes.
[43:54.770 --> 43:55.710]  I've done both.
[43:56.490 --> 43:56.970]  Oh, really?
[43:56.970 --> 44:00.350]  I hurt myself pretty badly on a snowmobile.
[44:01.310 --> 44:01.570]  What?
[44:02.050 --> 44:02.490]  Yeah.
[44:02.710 --> 44:02.830]  What?
[44:03.650 --> 44:05.250]  Water's softer than snow.
[44:05.890 --> 44:07.110]  What are they doing?
[44:08.770 --> 44:15.030]  Dude, I was going, like, 45 on a snowmobile in upstate New York.
[44:15.030 --> 44:15.050]  Oh, my God.
[44:15.270 --> 44:18.550]  Just through the woods, and I hit a fucking little jump and went airborne.
[44:19.050 --> 44:19.350]  Oh, no.
[44:19.350 --> 44:24.790]  And the thing, when it hit the ground, it, like, dug in and, like, fucking ripped my leg out from under me.
[44:24.810 --> 44:25.930]  I had to go to the emergency room.
[44:26.150 --> 44:26.670]  It was a whole thing.
[44:26.670 --> 44:28.070]  Holy shit.
[44:28.750 --> 44:29.390]  It just...
[44:29.390 --> 44:30.790]  It just bruised the shit out of me.
[44:31.590 --> 44:33.030]  I never knew about that. That's crazy, dude.
[44:34.890 --> 44:36.310]  It was a lot of fun until that moment.
[44:36.970 --> 44:37.190]  Yeah.
[44:37.770 --> 44:39.330]  Chris Elliott's like, didn't I kill this kid?
[44:40.330 --> 44:41.110]  Do it again.
[44:42.430 --> 44:43.390]  Two if it's true.
[44:48.140 --> 44:51.440]  It's weird that they never pan down to the mound of bird shit right below.
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.740]  Is that true? A snowmobile killed Ken Block?
[44:57.820 --> 44:58.700]  Yeah, I think so.
[44:59.380 --> 45:00.000]  Oh, fuck.
[45:05.500 --> 45:08.100]  This dude believes in the double tap method.
[45:09.520 --> 45:11.420]  Are they gonna steal this guy's bird?
[45:17.820 --> 45:19.020]  Oh, I...
[45:19.720 --> 45:21.340]  I remember this scene.
[45:22.120 --> 45:22.480]  Do you really?
[45:22.940 --> 45:23.220]  Yeah.
[45:23.980 --> 45:25.980]  This kid just farts like crazy.
[45:28.340 --> 45:29.520]  Another kid trope.
[45:40.010 --> 45:41.490]  Oh, that's... weird.
[45:50.220 --> 45:51.780]  Gonna dip it in the ketchup.
[45:52.860 --> 45:55.340]  Those fries have to be so cold.
[45:55.620 --> 45:56.200]  Oh, they look...
[45:56.200 --> 45:57.220]  Look at how floppy it is.
[45:57.220 --> 45:57.860]  It's so limp, too.
[45:58.160 --> 45:59.420]  Oh, they're so floppy.
[46:03.180 --> 46:04.320]  Just doing his job.
[46:05.140 --> 46:06.100]  I gotta be honest.
[46:06.200 --> 46:08.560]  He seems like the kind of guy that would eat cold fries.
[46:09.320 --> 46:09.620]  Yeah.
[46:11.340 --> 46:11.740]  Now...
[46:11.740 --> 46:13.420]  Does he know it's ketchup?
[46:13.620 --> 46:14.180]  With the character?
[46:16.260 --> 46:18.460]  I mean, after the first bite, yeah, but...
[46:18.460 --> 46:20.860]  Well, he stepped on it and he farted, so he knows it's...
[46:25.520 --> 46:27.060]  That bird could rip her eyes out.
[46:33.830 --> 46:35.730]  I'd be afraid of the bird, too. It's a scary-ass bird.
[46:38.470 --> 46:39.870]  What is going on?
[46:39.970 --> 46:40.770]  What is happening?
[46:44.190 --> 46:45.830]  He's making, like, a chess poutine.
[46:55.920 --> 46:56.800]  No, not the bird.
[47:02.960 --> 47:05.540]  Yeah, you're doing your job. You suck. Fuck you.
[47:05.860 --> 47:08.380]  We've stolen your only friend.
[47:13.080 --> 47:13.540]  Oh, no.
[47:14.560 --> 47:15.460]  I have a hostage.
[47:16.960 --> 47:18.960]  Is he still laying there like a dipshit?
[47:24.260 --> 47:26.340]  What a buffoon.
[47:29.620 --> 47:30.820]  Oh, my God.
[47:31.300 --> 47:32.860]  Oh, the fart knocked him over.
[47:34.460 --> 47:39.360]  I was about to compare that sequence to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but never mind.
[47:42.740 --> 47:45.240]  Josh Peck is his new bird. That's funny, Beastie Baker.
[47:47.180 --> 47:48.880]  Your name's Trudy now.
[48:01.560 --> 48:04.160]  Is that Iggy Pop? What the fuck?
[48:04.360 --> 48:05.720]  Absolutely Iggy Pop.
[48:06.320 --> 48:06.880]  Wow.
[48:07.140 --> 48:07.360]  What?
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.460]  This movie has everything.
[48:10.460 --> 48:12.820]  Gavin, you and I went ice skating together not too long ago.
[48:13.640 --> 48:14.940]  Yeah, it was pretty romantic.
[48:16.620 --> 48:19.420]  We did see somebody get carted off covered in blood.
[48:19.900 --> 48:20.380]  That's true.
[48:21.400 --> 48:23.000]  Wasn't that right before we went on as well?
[48:23.220 --> 48:26.040]  Yeah, they had to have a break to clean the blood off.
[48:33.450 --> 48:36.150]  He's in the Adventures of Pete and Pete.
[48:37.250 --> 48:38.270]  He's in this.
[48:38.970 --> 48:40.190]  What else is he...
[48:41.150 --> 48:43.230]  Like, why is he in a bunch of Nickelodeon stuff?
[48:45.190 --> 48:45.810]  That's a good question.
[48:49.150 --> 48:49.770]  Jesus.
[48:50.170 --> 48:51.010]  Oh, God.
[49:08.360 --> 49:09.600]  I don't think so.
[49:13.040 --> 49:13.660]  What?
[49:16.000 --> 49:17.520]  Is that his favorite animal?
[49:39.730 --> 49:41.770]  Why is he wearing...
[49:41.770 --> 49:46.010]  This is like the worst sweater with his little neck brace on the rocks.
[49:55.580 --> 49:56.000]  Ugh.
[49:59.400 --> 49:59.880]  Ooh.
[50:00.680 --> 50:00.940]  Ooh.
[50:02.860 --> 50:03.940]  Wow, three years?
[50:04.060 --> 50:04.440]  Come on, man.
[50:07.140 --> 50:07.920]  Amateur hour.
[50:22.360 --> 50:34.460]  It was...
[50:34.460 --> 50:36.120]  We're just watching the movie.
[50:36.980 --> 50:37.700]  Like, what?
[50:37.940 --> 50:39.680]  Like, something's actually happening.
[50:39.680 --> 50:39.900]  I was invested.
[50:40.540 --> 50:42.100]  Yeah, like, something's actually happening.
[50:42.180 --> 50:43.240]  We're just watching the movie.
[50:43.400 --> 50:44.500]  Iggy Pop pulled us in.
[50:44.820 --> 50:45.060]  Yep.
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.720]  I was thinking about gum flavors.
[50:47.560 --> 50:49.980]  His hair just completely shifted between those scenes.
[50:50.420 --> 50:51.520]  I like wintergreen.
[50:52.120 --> 50:52.940]  Say that again, please?
[50:53.640 --> 50:54.280]  I like wintergreen.
[50:54.320 --> 50:56.720]  That is, like, the most boring flavor of gum ever.
[50:58.600 --> 50:59.400]  Or peppermint.
[50:59.460 --> 51:00.100]  I mean, I don't mean to...
[51:00.100 --> 51:00.700]  Oh, my God.
[51:00.820 --> 51:02.340]  Just fucking...
[51:02.340 --> 51:03.660]  All the bottom of the barrels.
[51:03.800 --> 51:04.000]  Okay.
[51:04.340 --> 51:05.440]  Naming mild flavors.
[51:05.760 --> 51:06.020]  Yeah.
[51:06.420 --> 51:07.480]  As opposed to what?
[51:07.680 --> 51:08.800]  I don't know, like...
[51:08.800 --> 51:11.240]  Hubba Bubba Strawberry Watermelon?
[51:11.960 --> 51:14.180]  Yeah, but all that stuff runs out of flavor too fast.
[51:14.820 --> 51:15.440]  Yeah, but it had it.
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.240]  It had flavor for a little while.
[51:17.680 --> 51:18.920]  Yeah, for ten seconds, man.
[51:18.920 --> 51:23.620]  What if you had little, like, gum top-ups where you could pour some flavor on and put it back in?
[51:23.900 --> 51:24.720]  You know what?
[51:24.960 --> 51:25.220]  Reflave?
[51:25.860 --> 51:27.520]  If you're talking Reflave, I'm in.
[51:34.250 --> 51:34.870]  Oh, he's going in the toilet.
[51:34.870 --> 51:36.030]  Don't touch the toilet seat.
[51:36.250 --> 51:36.650]  Jesus.
[51:37.410 --> 51:38.270]  He's a lefty.
[51:38.410 --> 51:38.830]  Oh!
[51:41.050 --> 51:41.870]  That's awesome.
[51:42.070 --> 51:42.610]  For God's sake.
[51:44.090 --> 51:44.550]  Dude.
[51:45.030 --> 51:45.850]  It is his birth.
[51:47.590 --> 51:49.850]  Coffee and cigarettes came out after this.
[51:50.770 --> 51:51.570]  Did it really?
[51:52.010 --> 51:52.430]  Yeah.
[51:52.430 --> 51:55.310]  Coffee and cigarettes didn't come out until, like, 2004?
[51:56.010 --> 51:56.930]  I guess so.
[51:57.270 --> 51:57.510]  2002?
[51:58.190 --> 51:58.590]  2003?
[51:58.850 --> 51:59.150]  Something like that?
[51:59.230 --> 51:59.930]  Yeah, I guess so.
[52:01.550 --> 52:03.550]  I thought you meant the drink and the smoke.
[52:03.890 --> 52:05.210]  Nope, those came out way before.
[52:08.410 --> 52:18.270]  I'm talking to Nick on the Michael Jordan podcast about what he misses about smoking, and it was just having a cup of coffee with a cigarette standing at the door of the back porch with the door open.
[52:18.670 --> 52:21.730]  I was like, oh my God, this is, like, the realest thing I've ever heard.
[52:21.730 --> 52:23.090]  Oh, it was so real.
[52:24.210 --> 52:26.190]  I'm just imagining that Ben Affleck picture.
[52:27.230 --> 52:29.830]  Yeah, it's that, but, like, less sad.
[52:30.290 --> 52:31.830]  It's him, but 20 years younger.
[52:32.830 --> 52:33.630]  And with no money.
[52:33.830 --> 52:36.190]  What's everybody's favorite Jim Jarmusch film?
[52:39.510 --> 52:42.690]  I mean, coffee and cigarettes.
[52:45.030 --> 52:45.970]  It's a good one.
[52:47.950 --> 52:50.610]  It's definitely not the Dead Don't Die or whatever.
[52:50.610 --> 52:52.770]  I was gonna say, didn't he do a zombie one recently?
[52:52.770 --> 52:53.070]  He did.
[52:53.890 --> 52:57.090]  Yeah, it's not like it sucked, but it's not very good.
[52:57.390 --> 52:57.910]  Is that him?
[52:58.450 --> 52:59.030]  What's that?
[52:59.330 --> 53:00.090]  Broken Flowers?
[53:01.710 --> 53:02.110]  Maybe?
[53:02.690 --> 53:03.890]  I know he made Ghost Dog.
[53:04.350 --> 53:06.450]  Yeah, that's my favorite Ghost Dog way of the samurai.
[53:06.930 --> 53:08.990]  A lot of people like Dead Man, but I'm a Ghost Dog guy.
[53:21.320 --> 53:23.060]  You see his little arm back there?
[53:29.780 --> 53:30.180]  Pleh.
[53:32.800 --> 53:33.260]  Damn it.
[53:44.280 --> 53:47.060]  You think, uh, I don't know if they were single at the time,
[53:47.100 --> 53:50.420]  but do you think there's any chance that Chris Elliott and Gene Smart hooked up on the set?
[53:51.220 --> 53:51.800]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[53:51.880 --> 53:52.460]  That's awesome.
[53:52.640 --> 53:53.620]  I like thinking about that.
[53:53.680 --> 53:54.200]  That's cool.
[53:54.540 --> 53:56.020]  There goes Andrew again.
[54:01.180 --> 54:03.860]  That guy was really afraid of the blue kid.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.620]  I would be alarmed by the blue kid in his position.
[54:11.730 --> 54:13.270]  Is he gonna answer the phone?
[54:13.830 --> 54:15.170]  This is insane.
[54:15.170 --> 54:16.650]  What kind of turn...
[54:16.650 --> 54:19.690]  Go back to the thing we were all watching and sort of invested in.
[54:20.450 --> 54:21.350]  The love story?
[54:21.690 --> 54:24.430]  Yeah, like for some reason that was like at least gripping to us.
[54:24.510 --> 54:25.430]  This is just absurd.
[54:26.690 --> 54:28.250]  Does he have leather mittens on?
[54:28.530 --> 54:29.290]  He does.
[54:30.410 --> 54:31.230]  That's awesome.
[54:31.670 --> 54:32.570]  Oh no, the evil bird!
[54:36.310 --> 54:36.930]  What's this?
[54:40.450 --> 54:40.890]  Oh.
[54:40.890 --> 54:49.280]  So he decides on the snow day by not plowing?
[54:49.660 --> 54:50.700]  He's too efficient, yeah.
[54:51.420 --> 54:54.120]  Oh, he's Mr. Plow.
[54:54.580 --> 54:55.280]  That's his name.
[54:55.980 --> 54:57.440]  That name again is Mr. Plow.
[54:58.720 --> 54:59.440]  That was funny, Nick.
[55:02.340 --> 55:03.080]  It was!
[55:03.800 --> 55:04.200]  Okay.
[55:04.300 --> 55:05.900]  I was just really laughing, but I appreciated it.
[55:05.940 --> 55:10.020]  This is the guy who was wearing the floppy hat, but now he's just doing french fry stuff.
[55:10.400 --> 55:12.260]  Is he doing some like Close Encounters shit?
[55:12.260 --> 55:15.380]  I thought he was going to, but he's just being a dipshit.
[55:15.760 --> 55:16.040]  Okay.
[55:16.320 --> 55:19.620]  Is he the one you said looks like he was in Empire Records?
[55:21.040 --> 55:23.660]  I think everyone just sort of has that look, but yes.
[55:24.840 --> 55:26.560]  Does his hat say dub or club?
[55:27.200 --> 55:27.840]  Oh, I don't know.
[55:28.260 --> 55:28.420]  Dub.
[55:29.580 --> 55:30.760]  I gotta get a dub hat.
[55:39.940 --> 55:43.640]  He's just holding a real fucking bird.
[55:44.100 --> 55:45.500]  This bird is crazy.
[55:45.500 --> 55:47.300]  He's literally just like tied to his arm.
[55:47.620 --> 55:52.080]  That poor fucking bird.
[55:54.700 --> 55:57.440]  The bird's like, I hate the cold, I hate the cold, I hate the cold.
[55:59.560 --> 56:01.240]  Oh, Geoff, you posted a dub hat?
[56:01.380 --> 56:02.100]  I found a dub hat.
[56:02.500 --> 56:02.880]  Nice!
[56:07.080 --> 56:07.820]  Oh shit.
[56:09.260 --> 56:11.460]  It's like Jaws, but with a truck.
[56:16.400 --> 56:17.760]  Man, that is a pied bird.
[56:19.200 --> 56:21.600]  Oh my god.
[56:22.360 --> 56:23.400]  Holy shit.
[56:28.660 --> 56:29.180]  Okay.
[56:31.960 --> 56:32.560]  Holy shit.
[56:32.880 --> 56:35.680]  Look at that single looking ass strapped to the front.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.620]  The fucking B story to this movie is so much better than the A story.
[56:40.200 --> 56:42.440]  He's like crucified to the front.
[56:42.600 --> 56:43.700]  He's got the ketchup stains.
[56:51.430 --> 56:52.370]  Who's that girl?
[56:52.570 --> 56:54.070]  She's in a lot of 90s stuff, I think.
[56:54.070 --> 56:55.330]  That's a fucking mean girl, that's who it is.
[56:58.090 --> 56:59.750]  Oh, she looked like Fern Brady.
[57:00.090 --> 57:03.930]  You know, I feel like diner culture's kind of over at this point.
[57:04.030 --> 57:05.270]  Do you remember diner culture?
[57:07.090 --> 57:09.170]  You go sit at a diner and hang out?
[57:09.250 --> 57:10.310]  Is this like a social event?
[57:10.410 --> 57:11.050]  Drink a malted?
[57:11.470 --> 57:12.250]  What happened to that?
[57:13.410 --> 57:15.050]  What happened to it?
[57:15.190 --> 57:16.450]  Is Counter Cafe still around?
[57:17.170 --> 57:17.470]  Yes.
[57:17.930 --> 57:18.810]  Counter Cafe sucks.
[57:19.710 --> 57:20.590]  Yeah, fuck you.
[57:20.590 --> 57:22.190]  It didn't used to.
[57:22.470 --> 57:25.370]  No, that's the rage of disappointment.
[57:25.770 --> 57:27.970]  Because, Nick, I used to be a big Counter Cafe fan.
[57:28.130 --> 57:29.350]  I fucking loved Counter Cafe.
[57:29.510 --> 57:30.250]  I thought it was the best.
[57:30.410 --> 57:32.450]  And I just feel like it's gone downhill.
[57:32.990 --> 57:33.610]  Oh, that sucks.
[57:33.750 --> 57:35.410]  And also, speaking of disappointing,
[57:35.690 --> 57:37.910]  I had a paperboy the other day for the first time.
[57:38.070 --> 57:38.630]  Told you.
[57:39.050 --> 57:40.710]  Fucking did I talk to you about that place?
[57:40.890 --> 57:43.810]  Oh my god, you did and you were 100% right.
[57:45.470 --> 57:49.670]  Overpriced, under-seasoned, bland, boring, uninspired.
[57:49.670 --> 57:50.350]  Yep.
[57:50.950 --> 57:52.250]  So not worth it.
[57:52.330 --> 57:55.350]  It's a place where, like, my cousin wants to move here
[57:55.350 --> 57:57.350]  and she has her list of cool Instagram spots
[57:57.350 --> 57:59.030]  and she ate there and really liked it.
[57:59.110 --> 58:00.950]  And I went, oh yeah, that's who this is for.
[58:01.110 --> 58:01.830]  It is beautiful.
[58:02.150 --> 58:03.110]  Yeah, it looks great.
[58:03.270 --> 58:04.390]  It just tastes like nothing.
[58:04.710 --> 58:05.190]  What's it called?
[58:06.330 --> 58:06.690]  Paperboy?
[58:07.110 --> 58:09.650]  It's next to, it's like a block over from Nickel City.
[58:10.450 --> 58:10.730]  Oh.
[58:11.130 --> 58:12.690]  I just park over by Nickel City and go over there.
[58:13.090 --> 58:15.370]  It's like one of the hot breakfast and brunch spots.
[58:15.570 --> 58:16.190]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[58:16.190 --> 58:18.950]  It's like, do you love waiting 45 minutes to eat some pancakes?
[58:18.950 --> 58:20.350]  Come to Paperboy.
[58:20.610 --> 58:22.530]  Do you know if Magnolia Cafe is still any good?
[58:24.310 --> 58:26.070]  I went there with Ray not too long ago.
[58:26.170 --> 58:26.510]  It was pretty good.
[58:27.650 --> 58:29.590]  Yeah, I always thought it was better than Kirby Lane.
[58:31.190 --> 58:33.630]  They're like pretty similar to me, I'd say.
[58:34.070 --> 58:34.850]  They're close.
[58:35.350 --> 58:36.830]  There's something about Magnolia I really like.
[58:36.890 --> 58:40.150]  I feel like Kirby Lane is stickier than Magnolia.
[58:41.950 --> 58:43.870]  Like the tables and stuff?
[58:43.870 --> 58:47.930]  The tables and the chairs and like all the salt and pepper shakers.
[58:49.050 --> 58:50.350]  Nick, I'm telling you, man.
[58:50.390 --> 58:53.870]  You got Austin Diner on Burnet and North Loop.
[58:55.110 --> 58:56.370]  Oh, that place is good.
[58:57.350 --> 58:58.750]  That's the diner for me.
[58:58.910 --> 58:59.490]  That's the spot.
[58:59.710 --> 59:01.110]  Should we go to a diner after this movie?
[59:03.070 --> 59:03.430]  Yeah.
[59:04.570 --> 59:06.230]  You think the bird forgot it could fly?
[59:08.530 --> 59:08.790]  It forgot?
[59:08.790 --> 59:10.450]  It's going to get in the way of our GTA Let's Play.
[59:11.710 --> 59:15.230]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to prioritize a diner over content, sure, man, I guess.
[59:16.310 --> 59:17.910]  What if we shot content at the diner?
[59:19.290 --> 59:21.090]  What if we played GTA at the diner?
[59:22.010 --> 59:23.290]  What if we went to a diner in GTA?
[59:25.650 --> 59:26.850]  That's the easiest method.
[59:27.690 --> 59:30.090]  We can go to the Cluckin' Bell in GTA 4.
[59:35.010 --> 59:37.450]  Oh, dude, we went to...
[59:38.330 --> 59:39.910]  They opened a Nando's.
[59:41.710 --> 59:43.030]  Yeah, have you been for a Cheeky Nando's?
[59:43.570 --> 59:47.530]  Yeah, we had a bit of a Cheeky Nando's the other day.
[59:48.970 --> 59:49.830]  How was it?
[59:50.070 --> 59:52.350]  I loved it. It was fantastic.
[59:53.070 --> 59:54.270]  Did you get the hottest sauce?
[59:56.650 --> 01:00:01.230]  We used the hottest sauce, but I didn't get my chicken covered in it. I got the regular hot.
[01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:06.110]  Everybody in England thinks that sauce is so hot, and then you try it and you're like, are you fucking kidding me?
[01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:08.150]  It's good, though.
[01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.450]  It is very good. I like it.
[01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:10.010]  Oh, it's delicious.
[01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:10.810]  It's just not hot.
[01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:11.550]  Yeah.
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.240]  You dug a whale trench.
[01:00:23.810 --> 01:00:27.250]  And any of that heat, too, is not a lingering heat, which is nice.
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:28.250]  Just flavorful.
[01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.550]  Oh, shit!
[01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:35.310]  But the...
[01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:36.930]  But the charm.
[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.280]  That's from my dad.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:42.740]  Uh-oh.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:44.240]  He died hunting whales.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.560]  His name was Ahab.
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.560]  Or he's a creepy stalker.
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:50.560]  Oh, no, it's these guys.
[01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.160]  Kick his ass inside the whale.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.520]  How much is this?
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:03.920]  Yeah, hit him with a shovel.
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.080]  Mosquito.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.600]  Uh...
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]  Okay.
[01:01:27.330 --> 01:01:28.210]  What about now?
[01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.950]  You want to be me now?
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.880]  Who are these fucking...
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.420]  The henchmen are just fucking off.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:47.640]  All right, our friend's talking to his girl.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.120]  Fuck you.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.420]  They start pushing each other around.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:03.860]  Yeah!
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.100]  My dad had to do dental work on Shamu once.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:08.800]  Really?
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.300]  Oh, my God.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.000]  Why are we just hearing about this now?
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.640]  How have you never brought that...
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.240]  We've known you for a long time.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.740]  We even had the conversation about how King Kong had dental work in that new movie.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.400]  Are you an idiot, Nick?
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.380]  When did we have that conversation?
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.980]  That may have been prior to our regulation podcast.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:27.920]  No!
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.760]  That was, like, a month ago.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.200]  Oh, well, then, never mind.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.680]  Tell us!
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.440]  Oh, so...
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.080]  I'm from San Antonio.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.420]  And in San Antonio, we have a SeaWorld.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.300]  And my dad was an endodontist.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.780]  And he was in the military.
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.320]  And so, they were like, we...
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.380]  One of the whales has an issue with its...
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.340]  Like, one of its...
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:48.980]  I guess...
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.220]  I don't even know which tooth it was.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:50.920]  It was towards the back.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.160]  And my dad said that they were trying to find a way to hold the mouth open.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:56.360]  So, they had to use, like, multiple two-by-fours.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.280]  Oh, wow.
[01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.020]  What?
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.840]  And then they had to use some giant x-ray machine.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.840]  And he just did a little bit of work on it, I guess, to help pull a tooth.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:06.400]  What?
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:07.580]  Was it sedated?
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.200]  Yeah, it was sedated.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.240]  Was it in the water or out?
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.280]  Like, was it...
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:12.820]  How does...
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.260]  It was...
[01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.720]  You know, like, how they come up on that little ledge that has the water on it?
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.320]  Oh, that makes sense.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.180]  Nick, I hate to inform you, but your dad's a secret agent.
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.720]  And that's his cover story.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.720]  Oh, no.
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.980]  Do you think your dad's been to Middle Earth like they went to in Kong vs. Godzilla?
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.740]  I'd like to believe he rode Shamu there.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.800]  Middle Earth.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:36.740]  Nick's dad made him eat inside Subway when they got Subway.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:45.240]  Yeah, well, you see why some of the stories are a wide range between really cool and also, hey, we ate at a Subway on Sunday.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.500]  Could you sit down in a Subway?
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.220]  Yeah, dude.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:48.640]  Yeah, dude.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.060]  I was gonna think of it as one that had tables.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.500]  Wait, what?
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.980]  You've never been to one with tables?
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:57.720]  No.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:03:59.800]  Yeah, they exist.
[01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:00.700]  Wow.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.180]  Nick would know he had to eat inside.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:05.880]  Yeah.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:11.280]  He looks like a budget snowman from Rudolph the cartoon.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.180]  Yeah, he does.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.860]  Jack Frost or whatever.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.080]  Take the mic.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.580]  Actually, he thought that they said cut at this point.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.760]  Yeah, this is just...
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.300]  He's not acting.
[01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.380]  It's good that they didn't cut away from any of this.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.580]  They just put this on TV.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.440]  That was a funny shot.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.700]  Oh, it's coming down.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:58.480]  Get him.
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.080]  Why would the camera pan back around?
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.160]  What?
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.000]  Oh, Pam's pissed.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.180]  Their ratings are gonna be through the roof now.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.320]  Wow, we got the same webcam.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.460]  Is that the one you use with your grandfather?
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.540]  This is a brick, look at the size of it.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.100]  The picture looked really nice though.
[01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:02.910]  Terrible parent.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:09.920]  This is me and Albert fucking constantly.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.600]  I was...
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:19.580]  I just needed to record and edit two episodes of Saw right yesterday.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.900]  And because of Albert, it took me almost seven hours.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.700]  Every fucking ten minutes.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:38.680]  Disarmed.
[01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.080]  Disarmed.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.700]  Andrew, you gotta relax.
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:51.200]  Oh, listen.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.160]  When I'm throwing bullets.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.080]  Get her in the face.
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:04.020]  Kill shot.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:10.100]  And now she's gonna have fun.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.120]  That's crazy.
[01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:14.860]  Big as a little ass.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:18.460]  Yeah.
[01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:20.120]  She's putting the gloves on.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.180]  I would like to see behind the scenes footage of where this kid's throws were really landing.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:25.720]  Yeah, right?
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.220]  Oh, right on his head.
[01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.890]  He ran where she was going.
[01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:36.550]  Come on, kid.
[01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:41.310]  She doesn't care about the call with Beijing.
[01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:47.690]  Dude, the Broncos are stomping the Chargers, this rocks.
[01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:48.530]  What a day.
[01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:49.530]  We gotta watch Snow Day.
[01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:51.170]  Chargers are losing.
[01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:52.090]  I'm having a great time.
[01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.290]  Are those from a real thing?
[01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:58.210]  Does anyone recognize those action figures as being from anything?
[01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:59.210]  Yeah, Meltar.
[01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:00.050]  Chat, do you know?
[01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:07.530]  They're small soldiers.
[01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:12.470]  He's gonna etch a grilled cheese sandwich.
[01:08:17.570 --> 01:08:20.290]  Like a cross between Ken and Lion-O.
[01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:21.550]  I was thinking Ryu.
[01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:28.010]  I like the polar bear guy with the tiniest fucking head you've ever seen.
[01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:29.230]  Who, Meltar?
[01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:37.570]  What was the Nickelodeon show with the moving action figures?
[01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:39.990]  Do you remember what I'm talking about?
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.170]  Action League Now.
[01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:42.450]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.690]  They were using their finest Action League Now.
[01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:48.290]  Melt Man and Stinky Diver and all that stuff?
[01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:48.830]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08:50.130 --> 01:08:52.010]  This guy's got like a wanking hand.
[01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.690]  Hell yeah, that's my kind of guy, dude.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.140]  I bet this took longer than shooting the whole rest of the movie.
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:07.760]  No shit.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.620]  This was a lot of budget, unfortunately.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:21.920]  There's little things that pop up in movies like this where people say death or die or whatever and then suddenly your three, four year old kid is like, you're gonna die.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.380]  What the fuck?
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.080]  I've never experienced that one, buddy.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.200]  That might just be you.
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:34.520]  You know like when they turn slowly and look at you and they say you're gonna die and their eyes turn red and then like everything in the house starts shaking?
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.940]  You know, kid stuff.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.460]  You know like when you walk into your kid's room and he's writing on the wall with a red crayon writing over and over again?
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:44.880]  And he's like upside down on the ceiling, bat style.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:48.600]  Yep.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:58.140]  Nick, do you ever get weirded out that your kid could be alive in the year 2100?
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:09:59.900]  Oh, fuck.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.960]  Yeah, do you ever get weirded out by that new thing to you, Nick?
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.060]  Is it weird to you that your kid might live a long and full life?
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.960]  Yeah, does that ever like fuck you up?
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:14.580]  I mean, the year fucks me up, but him living a long life would be ideal, me thinks.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.640]  Me thinks.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.060]  Me thinks, me hopes.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:21.620]  You better put that fucking thesaurus down.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.940]  Don't let snow day rub off on you, Nick.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:36.660]  Okay.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.640]  I think GTA 6 will be out in the year 2100.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.440]  Oh, this is like Eurotrip, but Nickelodeon.
[01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:54.810]  Everyone in this looks like they would be in Eurotrip.
[01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:55.490]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.710]  See?
[01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:59.550]  I thought they were going to not kiss.
[01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.190]  The hesitation was weird.
[01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:05.130]  Yeah, she really hesitated.
[01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.890]  And he did nothing.
[01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:10.790]  She looks like she knows how to snowboard.
[01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:13.390]  She does.
[01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:16.330]  Like, not based on her outfit, just like her hair and like look.
[01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.490]  Everything about her says I know how to snowboard.
[01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.910]  I think he knows how to drink hot chocolate back at the inn.
[01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:26.610]  Couldn't do a take two on that one, huh?
[01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.230]  We call this movie one and done, baby.
[01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:34.570]  Is this 98 degrees?
[01:11:35.490 --> 01:11:36.270]  I believe so.
[01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:37.470]  Is that the Round Rock?
[01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:40.930]  No, honestly, two round.
[01:11:42.730 --> 01:11:43.790]  Chat, chat.
[01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:46.190]  I think Gavin loves this guy.
[01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:51.550]  I think I hate this guy.
[01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:54.370]  So does Chevy Chase.
[01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:55.690]  So does Boss Hogg.
[01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:59.310]  Them Duke boys are at it again.
[01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.550]  Isn't he like weird?
[01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:06.090]  Isn't he like a weird right wing guy now?
[01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:07.190]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:08.230]  He's Duke's a MAGA earlier.
[01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:11.510]  He's got a lot of opinions.
[01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.490]  I just I remember this is going to sound crazy.
[01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:18.670]  But the thing that I remember him most for is he was the dad on Smallville.
[01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:20.070]  Yes, he was.
[01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.470]  He was pretty good in that.
[01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:24.550]  He was Superman's dad.
[01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:25.990]  Holy shit.
[01:12:26.150 --> 01:12:27.490]  I never made that connection.
[01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:28.610]  Wow.
[01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:30.430]  That guy on the right looks like James Bay.
[01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:33.290]  He did kind of.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.760]  Making their way the only way they know how.
[01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:45.100]  That's just a little bit more than the law would allow.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.680]  Do you think Chevy Chase liked this guy?
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.300]  I don't think Chevy Chase likes anyone.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.380]  Yeah, I was going to ask earlier.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.120]  Do you guys think Chevy Chase ever has ever made a friend on set?
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:57.640]  No, not on set.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.340]  Do you think he's weirded out when he likes someone?
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.200]  Yes. Oh, 100%.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.340]  He like doesn't quite understand.
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:05.360]  He kind of like takes a step back and he looks in the mirror and he goes,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.180]  what's this feeling?
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.220]  What happened to me?
[01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:13.760]  And then the camera pans back and up into the sky slowly as 2000s music plays.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:22.540]  Yeah.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:23.860]  Yeah.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.240]  Yeah, everyone in the crowd.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.220]  Yeah, tell us.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:26.640]  Yeah.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.300]  What, snow?
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:37.620]  Oh boy.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:38.280]  Can't say that.
[01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.060]  Uh-uh.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.480]  One of the 11 words you can't say anymore.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.200]  Used to be 7.
[01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:58.030]  Good old Canada.
[01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.730]  Yep.
[01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:00.810]  51st date.
[01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:06.390]  I thought you said 51st dates.
[01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.270]  That's a different thing.
[01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:09.950]  Yeah.
[01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.590]  Oh.
[01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:17.450]  Why is this on the news?
[01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.550]  I just want to know if it's supposed to be sunny tomorrow.
[01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.050]  At home.
[01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:28.510]  What the fuck is going on?
[01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.050]  Why is this such a weird news?
[01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.270]  What happened to that dude who professed his love earlier?
[01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:36.110]  Why aren't they talking about the robbery at the grocery store for Christ's sake?
[01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:37.530]  Oh, I read.
[01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:41.690]  Did you see the fun fact on snow day where there was a robbery?
[01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:43.110]  What?
[01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:44.310]  You didn't see that?
[01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.750]  All right, hang on.
[01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:45.950]  Let me get back to it.
[01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:47.490]  I was looking at...
[01:14:47.490 --> 01:14:48.510]  I just pulled up the IMDb.
[01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.210]  Uh, trivia.
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:15:02.610]  A real bank heist took place near the filming location and the felons drove right past the production assistant who immediately alerted everyone on set.
[01:15:02.970 --> 01:15:07.070]  The felons were surprised to see what they were driving through was a film set.
[01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:12.430]  Shortly before driving headlong into and becoming hopelessly stuck in a fake snow drift.
[01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.830]  No.
[01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.590]  That's awesome.
[01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:17.890]  This movie caught bank robbers?
[01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.610]  Yep.
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:23.520]  Is he gonna go kiss the other girl now, too?
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:24.740]  Hell yeah.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:25.980]  This guy's crazy.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:26.500]  Hell yeah.
[01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.480]  He just looked in a mirror and he said, you can't have it all.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.560]  Well done.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.200]  Yeah, get him, Nick.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:58.660 --> 01:15:58.980]  Whoa.
[01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.400]  Don't do it.
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:01.840]  You already kissed...
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.060]  Oh.
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:04.680]  Eww.
[01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:06.800]  Kiss the girl.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.540]  This guy's getting some in this movie.
[01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.880]  Dear Penthouse Forum.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:21.560]  I think his dick didn't respond in the same way this time and he realizes it's the other, the snowboarder he likes.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.740]  Dear Penthouse Forum, anything can happen on a snow day.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:26.520]  Wow.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.880]  There I was.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.820]  In the middle of an epic snow fight.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:37.580]  A pied crow flew off in the distance.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.800]  Some kid was strapped to a snow plow.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.940]  This farting child ran by me.
[01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:54.690]  Push her off.
[01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:55.790]  Push her into the pool.
[01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:02.970]  Just begun?
[01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:05.550]  What's the one on the side doing?
[01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.530]  Is that to, like, swing down?
[01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.070]  I guess?
[01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:12.470]  You know what we should do?
[01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:13.270]  What?
[01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:17.270]  How is this gonna lead to content? Go ahead.
[01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:19.010]  Oh my God, that bird!
[01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:21.390]  Tree's taking the wheel.
[01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.810]  You're gonna love this idea.
[01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:29.050]  The five of us together should write a sequel to Snow Day.
[01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:30.150]  Our own script.
[01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.510]  Oh God.
[01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:31.830]  Oh wow.
[01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:32.870]  That's crazy.
[01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.770]  Why not?
[01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:37.590]  Honestly, why not?
[01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:43.030]  Why not? We just gotta outline it and then we'll just fuckin' bang it out like we banged out Celestial Gorbosis.
[01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:46.950]  42 year old Josh Peck returns to the town he grew up in.
[01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:50.070]  I think they remade this movie?
[01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.750]  They did.
[01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.210]  Yeah.
[01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:52.810]  Are you fuckin' serious?
[01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:55.690]  In 2022 and you're...
[01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:57.090]  Hang on.
[01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:00.810]  Rob Hubel's in it.
[01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.430]  We gotta watch the remake and see how it compares.
[01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:05.630]  We don't. I don't think we do.
[01:18:06.010 --> 01:18:06.670]  I think we do.
[01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:07.710]  Think the bird is CG?
[01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:11.550]  Nah, it's probably a dog.
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:24.580]  Jesus.
[01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.100]  Uh oh.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.420]  Yeah man, talk your shit.
[01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:56.350]  Holy shit.
[01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:56.690]  Okay.
[01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:56.830]  Okay.
[01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:01.690]  There's a little bit of magic in this movie.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.260]  The children rise.
[01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:16.530]  Oh shit.
[01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.790]  Rohirrim!
[01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:26.950]  The thing I'll say about this movie that I really like is that it's about 90 minutes long.
[01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:34.770]  And I think that's... I don't mean that as like making fun of it. I mean that as like a very positive thing for a movie like this.
[01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.190]  It knows what it is.
[01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:47.370]  Yup. It does not overstay. It's not trying to do too much. It's giving you goofy storylines. It's like all these things sort of converge. This is great. This is what we are missing from movies now.
[01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:56.490]  You are 100% correct. Like in the pitch of this film, the first thing they say is, alright, it's 90 minutes, it's a kid's movie, it's about a snow day.
[01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:57.050]  Yup.
[01:19:57.190 --> 01:19:58.770]  You gotta leave with 90 minutes.
[01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.470]  Absolutely.
[01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.130]  Do you think this is all of Canada's hockey sticks?
[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:08.050]  Yeah, they're gonna beat the shit out of him and his bird with hockey sticks.
[01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:12.990]  You know how there's more guns in America than people? Are there more hockey sticks in Canada than people?
[01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:14.250]  Absolutely.
[01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:20.370]  They're gonna break his truck? His livelihood?
[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:26.440]  Children playing.
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:33.360]  Those children are the Canadian government. He is the postal workers.
[01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:35.640]  Trudeau and his gang.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.040]  Back to work.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.900]  You've broken him.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.440]  Back to work.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.520]  You're gonna see him at school? What?
[01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:13.000]  Yeah, that's weird.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.640]  Does he work at the school?
[01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:15.760]  Trudy does.
[01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.500]  No, he just likes to hang out there, I think.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.980]  You can do that.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.020]  You can de-plow.
[01:21:26.260 --> 01:21:27.620]  From suck to blow?
[01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.500]  I didn't know that was the lyric.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:42.400]  That was all my darling Clementine.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:42.860]  Me too.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:43.760]  Yeah.
[01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:48.430]  We're stealing a car.
[01:21:49.650 --> 01:21:49.850]  Yup.
[01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:51.330]  It's gonna be a what?
[01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:52.550]  A real hoo-ha.
[01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:54.090]  The kid's braces.
[01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:58.410]  Return them to the children.
[01:21:58.410 --> 01:22:01.430]  So if they drive in reverse, they put all the snow back?
[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:05.510]  Oh, like Ferris Bueller.
[01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:05.910]  Yeah.
[01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:08.270]  Where's Trudy?
[01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.040]  What if Trudy ate him overnight?
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:20.160]  Peck his eyes out?
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.240]  Yeah, just pecked at him.
[01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:24.360]  I'm just imagining the end of The Shining cuts to him the next morning.
[01:22:34.730 --> 01:22:35.210]  Hi.
[01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:36.650]  Bye.
[01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:36.770]  Bye.
[01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:41.330]  That dude does have a right to be upset.
[01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:42.970]  He did steal his entire snowmobile.
[01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:43.890]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.830]  His dad's gonna be pissed.
[01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.750]  Oh, is he gonna fart?
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:04.040]  What the fuck?
[01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:13.450]  Oh, God.
[01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:14.290]  Yeah, die!
[01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:15.390]  Yeah, he's just fucking dead.
[01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:16.530]  Now you're dead!
[01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:17.830]  You're dead now!
[01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:19.350]  That's it, it's over.
[01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:20.710]  You'll never date that girl now.
[01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:21.590]  You don't have legs!
[01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:23.770]  Now you're different!
[01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:32.190]  That's gotta be a felony.
[01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:37.770]  Yeah, but it's probably on the adult.
[01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:39.130]  It's Grand Theft Auto as well, I believe.
[01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:42.710]  This is great.
[01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:44.490]  This is such a great kids movie plot.
[01:23:45.290 --> 01:23:46.790]  Chat's saying, try her as an adult.
[01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:50.010]  This was calculated.
[01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.730]  Premeditated.
[01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:54.490]  We have her notes in crayon.
[01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:56.690]  Left a dude to freeze to death.
[01:23:56.850 --> 01:23:57.730]  Drove over that kid.
[01:23:57.730 --> 01:24:00.710]  I want you to have him.
[01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:01.270]  Yeah!
[01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:03.330]  You can have Ryu.
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:13.160]  You think he looks that sick because he's been eating asbestos this whole time?
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.900]  Yeah, I just think he's fucked up.
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.360]  Just got hypothermia the whole movie.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.980]  Under the fun fact section on IMDb.
[01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:31.010]  They should help get him out of the snow by pissing him out.
[01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.710]  Hell yeah.
[01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.810]  Keep him warm.
[01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:35.330]  Keep him alive.
[01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:36.090]  At least for a bit.
[01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:38.250]  Jesus.
[01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:40.370]  I think Trudy's gonna come down and get him.
[01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:46.030]  I think Trudy's gonna be eating good for a couple days.
[01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:51.010]  Iggy Pop's gonna show up tomorrow and have to call the cops about this dead kid in the snow.
[01:24:52.730 --> 01:24:55.030]  Nah, this kid's gonna grow up to be the next Chris Elliott.
[01:24:56.770 --> 01:24:58.650]  He'll be driving that snow plow in 10 years.
[01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:59.990]  Snow plow man beginnings!
[01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:02.650]  Oh my god, this is all that goes in the sequel!
[01:25:03.450 --> 01:25:05.490]  Well, you gotta stop talking about it or it'll spoil the movie.
[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:17.290]  Like, what do you think the budget was for this movie? It couldn't have been that much, right?
[01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:18.210]  I can look it up.
[01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:22.270]  What percentage of it went to Chevy Chase?
[01:25:22.570 --> 01:25:23.410]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:29.530]  Like, I think the budget was probably like 8 to 10 million.
[01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:32.830]  I was gonna guess 7.
[01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:39.870]  The year 2000, shot in 99? I bet it probably couldn't have been more than like...
[01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:45.030]  God, if it crossed 10 million, that'd be crazy.
[01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:48.850]  Did they not show the budget on Box Office Mojo anymore without paying for it?
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.700]  Oh no, it's there. Budget was $13 million.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.020]  Oh wow, I was gonna guess 12.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.780]  It opened with $14 million in the theater.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:05.820]  Went on to grow $60 million domestically. This one was a huge hit.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:06.680]  $60 million?!
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.960]  Yeah. Did another $2 million internationally, I assume that's Andrew.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:14.360]  $62,464,000 globally.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.480]  I couldn't watch that. It looked like his ears were gonna get cut off.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.760]  That was a dangerous stunt.
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.840]  I think...
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.820]  Your 10 minutes starts now.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:31.480]  This movie is very competently made. It came out in the year 2000.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.320]  It wasn't a time where movies... how movies now look.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:39.380]  Everything looks pretty good, but everything kind of sucks.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:44.580]  This was pretty... this is well lit and at least medium well shot.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:50.820]  This is fine. It's like a fine movie for $13 million. That's awesome.
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.780]  This is what we're missing. We need more of this stuff.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:53.680]  I totally agree.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.540]  Yeah, we couldn't do this with $13 million.
[01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:02.880]  Luckily for us, we don't have to because we don't have $13 million.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.880]  God, imagine if we had $13 million. That would be awesome.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.740]  I wonder if you could buy Chris Elliott for $13 million.
[01:27:14.820 --> 01:27:16.340]  Just hire him for a scene.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:19.920]  What the...
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:23.980]  Warriors! Come out and play!
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:26.020]  Are they gonna kill someone?
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:28.460]  Yeah, I think they killed two people.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.880]  Yeah, I think the body count was two on that one.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:31.920]  God, this fucking guy.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.440]  Here they come for the third...
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.660]  Now they're gonna start killing people to cover it up.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.840]  You could have cut this guy entirely out of the movie.
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.040]  He's been out all day?
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:40.700]  What?
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.660]  Alright, that's a fun payoff.
[01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:47.180]  Why does he have outside lights inside?
[01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:47.760]  That's great.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.560]  You guys had a shitty, shitty thing.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.220]  Andrew, I didn't hate it.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.040]  That's great!
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:59.520]  I really genuinely thought I was gonna hate this movie.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.580]  I really liked it.
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.580]  It's very, as you said, 98.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.700]  It aims the audience it's targeting for.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.300]  Chris Elliott is a lot of fun in it.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.320]  Yeah.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:15.540]  It is competently made.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.040]  The script is fun enough.
[01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:18.800]  All the characters are fine.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:21.600]  It's a very, like, kid's idea, kid's movie.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.560]  And I think that's great.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.520]  I feel like it's very understandable that me as a six-year-old thought this was a fantastic movie.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.580]  Oh my god, yeah.
[01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.540]  There's no point where the film drags.
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:36.940]  Maybe around the Iggy Pop stuff, but not even really then.
[01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:38.600]  It was pretty solid all the way through.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.280]  It is a good film.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.820]  It's a fun little 90-minute movie.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:45.420]  Yeah, for a kid's movie, I give it like a solid seven and a half or eight.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:50.340]  I'm going to be very surprised if they don't show bloopers in the credits.
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.340]  I'll tell you what, though.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:55.420]  All the bloopers are just Chevy Chase yelling at kids.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.800]  Stop stepping on his lines.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.800]  This really reminded me how fun a movie can be when it's not, you know, a necessary two hours or more.
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:05.620]  God, when it's 90 minutes, isn't it a blast?
[01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:14.540]  I just, I think, I think a 90-minute movie is such a great time when you watch Crave and the Hunter and it's two and a half hours and you just-
[01:29:14.540 --> 01:29:14.840]  Two and a half?
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:19.960]  Jordan Swear's sitting next to you going, and you have to end.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.840]  No more scenes.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.460]  And there's five more scenes.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:26.780]  He had sunk down so low in his chair, he could not get lower.
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:27.780]  It was awesome.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.160]  It was so funny.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:32.300]  What if we did a 90-minute movie draft?
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.000]  Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.820]  That is a great idea.
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.440]  I love that.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.500]  90-minute movie draft is a great idea.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.000]  Midnight Toot's had a pretty good comment.
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.700]  He said they had to keep Chevy Chase away from the main cast.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.240]  He really did shoot away from the main cast most of the film.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.480]  He doesn't have anything to do with anyone in that movie.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:52.220]  I bet all the scenes with him and kids are the same shot with a green screen.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:57.160]  The only scene where his, like, oldest son sees him and yells, Chevy Chase doesn't see him.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:58.820]  They don't appear in the same shot together.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:29:59.480]  Yep.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.240]  Wow, how crazy.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:05.240]  90-minute movie draft.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.720]  90-minute movie draft.
[01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:07.820]  I like that.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:08.640]  I love that.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.020]  I think it's a great idea.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.020]  Never seen a movie with so many B-plots?
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:14.880]  There's, like, almost no A-plot.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.200]  It's just B-plots.
[01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:17.540]  Oh, look at Cade!
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:18.360]  Oh, Cade!
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:19.940]  Oh, wow!
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.840]  With the an-egg and the TLC logo style.
[01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:25.120]  No one's gonna understand that.
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.040]  Our audience does not get that at all.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.480]  I'm fuckin' downloadin' that.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:33.360]  Isn't Love actually just a series of B-plots?
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.340]  Yes, yes it is.
[01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.240]  That's why I drafted it in our Christmas movie draft.
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:37.980]  I love that movie.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.240]  I'm just imagining that an-egg logo coming up with, like, the HBO static sound.
[01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:47.960]  Except it's just the sound of an egg frying.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:48.840]  Hell yeah.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.680]  And then Sopranos starts.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.260]  Hell yeah.
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:52.120]  Dogs and birds.
[01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:59.140]  What is the, uh, when you hear the HBO sound, what's the theme song that plays?
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.720]  Probably Sopranos.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:00.900]  Sopranos.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:01.360]  Yeah.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:03.340]  Geoff?
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.320]  Uh, I don't hear any particular show.
[01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:12.280]  I hear the original sound ID, which is the...
[01:31:20.010 --> 01:31:21.450]  That was from my childhood.
[01:31:21.850 --> 01:31:23.690]  Did that come after the static sound?
[01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.150]  Yeah, before the static sound, they had that one.
[01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:27.250]  Oh, yeah.
[01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:28.930]  I don't think I've ever heard that.
[01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:30.850]  Maybe Deadwood, actually.
[01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:32.190]  Ooh, Deadwood's a good one.
[01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:35.070]  God, this show's so good.
[01:31:35.130 --> 01:31:37.190]  For me, it's just so Sopranos.
[01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:38.730]  Like, all the way.
[01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:40.930]  Like, every time I hear that static, it is...
[01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:41.910]  Oh, Sopranos is about to come on.
[01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:44.170]  Damn, Tales from the Crypt.
[01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:45.230]  Holy shit.
[01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:45.630]  Oh, shit.
[01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:47.250]  That show freaked me out.
[01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.910]  Oh, me too.
[01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:48.350]  Absolutely.
[01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:50.250]  Real sex.
[01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:50.910]  Fucking A.
[01:31:53.290 --> 01:31:56.730]  I feel like Geoff would have stories about knowing someone on real sex.
[01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:58.770]  I wish I did, but I don't.
[01:31:59.110 --> 01:32:00.450]  It just feels like you would.
[01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:02.810]  Well, guys, I think we did it.
[01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:06.210]  I think we watched Snow Day all the way through.
[01:32:07.190 --> 01:32:08.910]  I... Andrew, great pick.
[01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:09.970]  Great pick.
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:12.570]  Yeah, they went way better than I thought.
[01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:13.750]  It was just...
[01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:17.750]  You know, I wanted a movie that was for the season that you guys wouldn't have seen.
[01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:19.950]  And this was my go-to as a kid.
[01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:23.050]  And that was for winning the summer movie.
[01:32:23.150 --> 01:32:24.010]  And that was for winning.
[01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:25.070]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:26.390]  I got to make the pick.
[01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:28.830]  The music starts at about 45 seconds.
[01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.550]  Oh, cool.
[01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:32.250]  Well, there you go, guys.
[01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:34.750]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:35.790]  Thank you for being Falcons.
[01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:39.570]  Thank you for supporting us directly.
[01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:41.550]  We could not do this without you.
[01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:45.170]  We really appreciate you being a part of this and supporting us on Patreon.
[01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:49.050]  We definitely... we could try to do this without you.
[01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:51.910]  It would not go well, so we really appreciate you.
[01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:53.550]  We wouldn't be doing it for very long.
[01:32:54.090 --> 01:32:54.790]  That's for sure.
[01:32:54.790 --> 01:33:01.370]  So we really, really, truly, definitely, as much as we say it, we mean it twice as much because we could not do this without you.
[01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:02.970]  So thank you very much for being a part of this.
[01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:08.230]  And to be honest, as soon as we get off this, we're going to talk about you guys and how much we appreciate you, but privately.
[01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:10.410]  Yeah, that's very true.
[01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:11.750]  You guys were great in the chat, too.
[01:33:11.890 --> 01:33:12.670]  This was a lot of fun.
[01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:13.810]  This was a great way to do it.
[01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:15.030]  A lot of comedy in the chat tonight.
[01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.110]  What are the Falcon ratings before we go?
[01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.530]  Out of 10.
[01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.870]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:20.890]  What do you guys rate that movie?
[01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.650]  10 out of 10.
[01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:22.010]  Solid.
[01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:22.450]  7.
[01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:26.150]  7 out of 10 is a classic bagel rating.
[01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:26.690]  7.
[01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:28.830]  9.7.
[01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:32.750]  Decent.
[01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.930]  I think the average is somewhere between 7 and 8.
[01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:36.010]  Pretty good.
[01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.790]  Dusky, Jenna, 5 out of 10.
[01:33:40.210 --> 01:33:40.770]  Vyosh?
[01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:47.270]  For like a movie, whatever, it's like a 6.
[01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:47.890]  Who cares?
[01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:51.950]  For a 90-minute kids movie that came out in the year 2000, that's like an 8.
[01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:53.550]  100%.
[01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:55.610]  It does everything pretty well.
[01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:58.670]  None of it is very boring or drags.
[01:33:58.770 --> 01:34:00.690]  It does a good job at what it's trying to do.
[01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:04.450]  I think that's an 8 out of 10 if you're judging it from what it is trying to achieve.
[01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:12.210]  I was just about to say, too, they don't make that movie that good today, but I guess we can check because it was remade in 2022.
[01:34:12.210 --> 01:34:18.810]  But you know, just by not even closing your eyes, you know exactly what it looks like.
[01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:21.150]  You know how it's lit.
[01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:23.350]  You know what the characters look like.
[01:34:23.410 --> 01:34:24.390]  You know how everyone's dressed.
[01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:28.450]  None of it is the ugly little fat kid who farts.
[01:34:31.770 --> 01:34:32.810]  That's not it, man.
[01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:34.590]  It's just not there.
[01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:36.190]  I don't know.
[01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:38.650]  It's a bummer, but that's a fun movie.
[01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:40.390]  Good pick, Andrew.
[01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:45.750]  We'll have to see who wins the next movie draft and what we watch because that's a blast.
[01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:46.450]  I can't wait.
[01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:47.170]  Yep.
[01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:48.850]  Have a good night, everybody.
[01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.370]  Thank you very much.
[01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:54.610]  And we'll see you next time for our next Falcon event.
[01:34:54.810 --> 01:34:56.230]  We appreciate you guys and we'll see you later.
[01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.690]  Bye!
[01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:58.390]  Love you!
