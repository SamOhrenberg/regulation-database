[00:00.000 --> 00:03.720]  So, say Geoff goes first, fills his mouth, spits it into the Pyrex.
[00:04.720 --> 00:12.000]  Then he pours the Pyrex of his throat water into the green Gurpler.
[00:12.160 --> 00:15.140]  And then marks the line after it settles.
[00:15.360 --> 00:20.840]  Then we dump that liquid into the sink or into a bag and sell it.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.500]  And then the next person goes and we all mark.
[00:25.760 --> 00:28.700]  Here's what's going to happen. It's going to be four marks.
[00:31.180 --> 00:32.540]  Probably... this about.
[00:33.200 --> 00:35.320]  Probably be a horizontal line.
[00:35.340 --> 00:37.880]  I would think so. I would think so.
[00:38.200 --> 00:38.700]  Here's what we do.
[00:38.800 --> 00:40.580]  We go to my old house. 3 AM.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.020]  We dig up some dirt.
[00:42.540 --> 00:43.440]  They don't know.
[00:43.660 --> 00:48.700]  We come back, we spit our GERP sludge into little bits of dirt.
[00:48.840 --> 00:49.740]  We make GERPL mud.
[00:49.820 --> 00:50.180]  Great idea.
