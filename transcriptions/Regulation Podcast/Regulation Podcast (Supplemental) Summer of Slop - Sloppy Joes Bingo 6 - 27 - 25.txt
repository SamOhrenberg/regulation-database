[00:00.000 --> 00:00.800]  Dog's not too late.
[00:01.780 --> 00:02.200]  We're gonna laugh.
[00:03.380 --> 00:03.860]  Pfft.
[00:05.500 --> 00:07.600]  Well, we haven't started yet, but all right.
[00:08.500 --> 00:10.600]  Hey guys, welcome to the stream, maybe.
[00:10.840 --> 00:12.160]  If you're seeing this, welcome.
[00:12.820 --> 00:13.760]  Sloppy Joe's Mingo.
[00:14.120 --> 00:16.960]  It's Sloppy Joe's Mingo time, and we are ready to go.
[00:20.300 --> 00:22.860]  Everyone's pulling weight, everyone's doing their best.
[00:24.740 --> 00:26.140]  Everybody's just thankful for Gavin.
[00:26.380 --> 00:27.600]  Geoff's in a real mood today.
[00:27.680 --> 00:29.320]  Yeah, Geoff has been in a mood all day.
[00:29.320 --> 00:30.960]  I don't know what you mean by that.
[00:31.480 --> 00:32.620]  I think I do.
[00:34.020 --> 00:36.300]  If I could summarize your mood, it's this.
[00:38.020 --> 00:38.940]  That's about right.
[00:39.340 --> 00:40.460]  Well, we're in the office together.
[00:41.140 --> 00:42.220]  What do you want from me?
[00:42.440 --> 00:43.860]  I'm not the one that's fighting here.
[00:44.540 --> 00:45.400]  No, that's Nick and Eric.
[00:45.620 --> 00:46.920]  No, no, we're great.
[00:47.140 --> 00:49.600]  They've been at each other's shafts for half an hour.
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.300]  Half an hour?
[00:50.580 --> 00:51.360]  Just working the knobs.
[00:51.600 --> 00:52.060]  And why half an hour?
[00:52.800 --> 00:53.540]  It's something to think about.
[00:53.700 --> 00:55.440]  Guys, welcome to the stream.
[00:55.820 --> 00:57.760]  Thank you guys so much for joining us here
[00:57.760 --> 00:58.920]  on a Friday night.
[00:59.400 --> 01:01.280]  We appreciate everyone coming through.
[01:01.440 --> 01:04.540]  It's been a fun day of streaming.
[01:04.780 --> 01:05.940]  There you go.
[01:06.100 --> 01:07.340]  They can't see it yet.
[01:07.440 --> 01:08.920]  Again, we haven't started yet.
[01:09.100 --> 01:09.800]  And that's fine.
[01:09.920 --> 01:11.840]  Nick, you know what, Nick, why don't you cut it over
[01:11.840 --> 01:13.280]  and why don't you have a seat on the couch, bud?
[01:13.380 --> 01:13.720]  Okay.
[01:15.540 --> 01:18.620]  We're using regulationbingo.com.
[01:19.940 --> 01:20.920]  I can hear myself.
[01:21.360 --> 01:25.500]  We're using regulationbingo.com to generate a board
[01:25.500 --> 01:27.440]  and play Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:28.980 --> 01:30.420]  I'm gonna continue carrying this weight
[01:30.420 --> 01:32.580]  until anyone wants to grab this baton and run with it.
[01:32.680 --> 01:33.820]  I thought I was just listening to you
[01:33.820 --> 01:34.960]  do a pretty awesome intro.
[01:35.060 --> 01:35.540]  Yeah, I thought so.
[01:35.720 --> 01:36.640]  Yeah, you're doing a great job.
[01:37.080 --> 01:38.920]  I went ahead and generated my bingo card.
[01:39.100 --> 01:40.820]  I'm excited to get started with you guys.
[01:41.240 --> 01:43.920]  It's been, we determined maybe three or four months
[01:43.920 --> 01:45.040]  since we played Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:45.280 --> 01:46.380]  Yeah, does anyone remember the last time?
[01:46.440 --> 01:47.620]  Andrew, do you remember the last time we did this?
[01:47.660 --> 01:48.000]  Feels like too long.
[01:48.100 --> 01:48.840]  No clue.
[01:48.980 --> 01:49.300]  Right?
[01:49.480 --> 01:49.900]  It's been a while.
[01:49.920 --> 01:50.840]  It's been a while.
[01:50.960 --> 01:52.520]  But now it's time for Sloppy Joe's Bingo
[01:52.520 --> 01:55.260]  and it's time to get this right
[01:55.260 --> 01:57.820]  and do something that we put off for a while.
[01:57.880 --> 01:59.120]  But now it's the summer of slop.
[02:00.060 --> 02:02.520]  We're kicking it off with a very sloppy time
[02:02.980 --> 02:04.200]  for Sloppy Joe's Bingo, right?
[02:04.200 --> 02:06.140]  I'm already pretty excited about some of my prompts here.
[02:06.220 --> 02:08.120]  I've got head sheen, I've got sweet stache.
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.980]  I also have head sheen,
[02:12.340 --> 02:15.200]  but I have can see FaceTime screen.
[02:15.380 --> 02:16.440]  I don't feel good about that.
[02:16.760 --> 02:19.340]  I have a celebrity lookalike, which is always...
[02:19.340 --> 02:20.160]  Oh, that's a tough one.
[02:20.180 --> 02:20.900]  That's a quagmire.
[02:21.420 --> 02:23.000]  Get you guys to agree.
[02:23.040 --> 02:24.920]  I will say, I like Scooter Gang
[02:24.920 --> 02:26.860]  and then it does say three plus.
[02:27.220 --> 02:28.380]  That's a big joint.
[02:28.480 --> 02:28.840]  Wow.
[02:30.220 --> 02:34.600]  I have my personal favorite of all, which is Beach Goth.
[02:35.280 --> 02:37.120]  I also have Beach Goth.
[02:37.320 --> 02:38.140]  I love a Beach Goth.
[02:38.360 --> 02:41.520]  I have dog and then gurple clothing, which is a crazy one.
[02:41.540 --> 02:43.000]  You know what new one we should add in?
[02:43.120 --> 02:43.380]  What's that?
[02:43.580 --> 02:44.640]  Le Boo Boo.
[02:45.480 --> 02:47.020]  Let's see if somebody has a Le Boo Boo on their purse.
[02:47.380 --> 02:48.960]  I think Le Boo Boo is probably a pretty good one,
[02:49.020 --> 02:50.320]  but it's so hard to see.
[02:50.840 --> 02:51.580]  How would we see?
[02:51.640 --> 02:53.820]  Even with this giant TV that Geoff has been complaining
[02:53.820 --> 02:55.740]  about all day, it's so hard to see.
[02:55.880 --> 02:57.860]  This TV is such a fucking piece of shit.
[02:57.980 --> 02:59.520]  I told him to put it back in his car
[02:59.520 --> 03:01.240]  and take it back to Costco, but he didn't want to listen.
[03:01.360 --> 03:02.180]  What's wrong with it?
[03:02.260 --> 03:02.840]  Why didn't you listen?
[03:02.980 --> 03:06.300]  This fucking LG HUD GUI system
[03:06.300 --> 03:09.780]  is so fucking slow and stupid.
[03:10.240 --> 03:11.860]  And every time you turn this TV on,
[03:11.920 --> 03:13.860]  you have to update the fucking firmware.
[03:14.440 --> 03:14.760]  You don't have to level it.
[03:15.100 --> 03:16.320]  It's like Call of Duty.
[03:16.580 --> 03:18.880]  Every 24 hours, you've got to update Call of Duty.
[03:19.160 --> 03:19.800]  It's ridiculous.
[03:21.880 --> 03:22.700]  Looks good though.
[03:22.700 --> 03:24.900]  Andrew, have you got any prompts that you're excited about?
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.700]  I mean, I got bouncer bouncing,
[03:27.900 --> 03:29.240]  which is always fun to see.
[03:30.100 --> 03:32.680]  Dancing, cowboy hat, a lot of the classics.
[03:32.800 --> 03:34.800]  I'm trying to figure out if this guy's shirt is offensive.
[03:36.780 --> 03:38.660]  It feels like it should be.
[03:39.440 --> 03:41.200]  Oh my God, she's 60.
[03:41.640 --> 03:42.860]  Oh, that's got a force.
[03:43.640 --> 03:44.560]  I think it's nice.
[03:44.820 --> 03:45.780]  I think that's a nice one.
[03:45.800 --> 03:47.040]  And if she's 60, that's crazy.
[03:47.180 --> 03:49.820]  She doesn't look a day older than like 40, 52 maybe.
[03:49.820 --> 03:51.460]  Oh my God, she's...
[03:52.180 --> 03:52.500]  OMG.
[03:53.420 --> 03:55.380]  Crazy compliment, man.
[03:55.600 --> 03:56.580]  She does look great.
[03:56.900 --> 03:57.120]  Yeah.
[03:57.760 --> 03:58.360]  I'd say 52.
[03:58.620 --> 03:59.640]  Hey, hey, hey, drink this.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.780]  That's two Andrew lifetimes in one person.
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.160]  That's true.
[04:05.280 --> 04:05.440]  Yeah.
[04:06.080 --> 04:08.720]  What time are we kicking off with Sloppy Jizz Bingo?
[04:09.700 --> 04:13.520]  Why don't we say like 90 seconds from now?
[04:13.560 --> 04:15.220]  Oh my God, 90 seconds.
[04:15.480 --> 04:16.620]  90 seconds.
[04:17.100 --> 04:18.980]  Could not get any more text messages.
[04:18.980 --> 04:20.740]  Gonna go ahead and turn that off.
[04:20.780 --> 04:21.460]  Here we go, stopwatch.
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.020]  90 seconds begins now.
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.600]  In 90 seconds, Sloppy Jizz will begin.
[04:25.820 --> 04:29.600]  Guys, regulationbingo.com is where you can generate
[04:29.600 --> 04:30.660]  your own board.
[04:31.040 --> 04:33.060]  If you're watching, play along with us.
[04:33.380 --> 04:34.220]  Oh, let me see.
[04:34.420 --> 04:34.820]  What's that?
[04:35.220 --> 04:35.840]  Let's see if chat can be bigger.
[04:35.840 --> 04:37.100]  I was wondering if we could see chat from here.
[04:37.280 --> 04:39.960]  Gavin, what are you the most worried about
[04:39.960 --> 04:40.660]  on your bingo board?
[04:41.260 --> 04:43.080]  Formal attire, I feel like we could never get
[04:43.080 --> 04:43.940]  a good agreement on that.
[04:43.940 --> 04:44.800]  Yeah, that's a tough one.
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.080]  So I'm not looking forward to that.
[04:47.240 --> 04:49.000]  Puking, puking on the ground or in a trash can,
[04:49.080 --> 04:50.520]  I feel like we've...
[04:50.520 --> 04:51.940]  Have we ever seen that dude in life?
[04:52.080 --> 04:52.620]  No, I don't think so.
[04:52.640 --> 04:55.780]  I saw it three times in the first week I did it,
[04:55.900 --> 04:57.160]  which is why I added it again,
[04:57.320 --> 04:58.780]  and then it's not come back.
[04:58.880 --> 05:00.480]  Hold control and scroll.
[05:00.480 --> 05:01.560]  I tried it already, it doesn't work.
[05:01.560 --> 05:01.820]  Really?
[05:02.500 --> 05:03.400]  Oh, you know what?
[05:03.540 --> 05:03.800]  Control!
[05:05.100 --> 05:05.800]  That was FN.
[05:06.340 --> 05:06.980]  Why is FN there?
[05:07.680 --> 05:08.580]  I don't know.
[05:08.740 --> 05:09.760]  Do you know what FN stands for?
[05:10.360 --> 05:11.100]  Fuck you, man.
[05:13.460 --> 05:14.140]  That'll be it.
[05:14.840 --> 05:17.540]  We're at just about 60 seconds.
[05:17.640 --> 05:19.960]  So we got 30 seconds before Slopper Clock starts,
[05:19.960 --> 05:21.180]  before we get going.
[05:21.860 --> 05:22.220]  Yep.
[05:22.740 --> 05:23.040]  All right.
[05:23.200 --> 05:23.900]  I can see chat.
[05:24.040 --> 05:24.640]  Can you read that?
[05:24.880 --> 05:25.700]  Yeah, that's great.
[05:25.740 --> 05:26.680]  Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[05:26.880 --> 05:27.040]  Yeah.
[05:27.380 --> 05:27.560]  Nice.
[05:27.800 --> 05:28.620]  That's phenomenal.
[05:28.740 --> 05:30.260]  I don't know why Eric gives you such a hard time.
[05:30.360 --> 05:30.920]  I don't either.
[05:31.260 --> 05:31.920]  I fixed everything.
[05:31.980 --> 05:32.800]  Well, thanks for the subs.
[05:32.800 --> 05:34.040]  I know, you did a great job.
[05:34.420 --> 05:36.780]  We just tested it in any of the time previous,
[05:36.900 --> 05:37.540]  we wouldn't have had an issue.
[05:37.780 --> 05:38.520]  Well, there was...
[05:38.520 --> 05:40.360]  Guys, we got 10 seconds.
[05:40.380 --> 05:42.080]  That guy almost hit my car big time.
[05:42.120 --> 05:42.600]  I know.
[05:42.780 --> 05:43.160]  10 seconds.
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.560]  He said thank you to the wrong dude.
[05:44.560 --> 05:44.860]  Here we go.
[05:45.440 --> 05:45.800]  Guys.
[05:45.920 --> 05:51.000]  It begins 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[05:51.320 --> 05:52.040]  Slopper Clock!
[05:52.320 --> 05:52.600]  All right.
[05:52.760 --> 05:53.240]  It's going.
[05:53.460 --> 05:54.380]  A head sheen already?
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.120]  It's a t-shirt.
[05:55.320 --> 05:56.460]  Definitely a head sheen.
[05:56.500 --> 05:57.080]  Oh, I have head sheen.
[05:57.200 --> 05:57.380]  Excellent.
[05:57.600 --> 05:58.640]  Oh, is that a way up?
[05:59.140 --> 05:59.560]  What was she saying?
[05:59.660 --> 06:00.200]  Is that a stupid hat?
[06:00.660 --> 06:00.980]  Yeah.
[06:01.180 --> 06:01.660]  She's got a sailor cap.
[06:01.900 --> 06:03.460]  She's got a sailor captain's hat.
[06:03.720 --> 06:04.700]  That's a stupid hat.
[06:04.740 --> 06:05.420]  On her it is.
[06:05.420 --> 06:06.160]  That could be a job.
[06:06.620 --> 06:07.720]  She's not a captain.
[06:08.720 --> 06:09.320]  I'd say that.
[06:09.540 --> 06:09.780]  All right.
[06:09.780 --> 06:10.780]  If you guys want to go dumb hat,
[06:10.840 --> 06:11.280]  we can do dumb hat.
[06:11.280 --> 06:12.100]  I don't know why I called it.
[06:12.100 --> 06:12.660]  I don't have it.
[06:12.720 --> 06:13.240]  I do.
[06:13.340 --> 06:13.820]  Thanks, man.
[06:13.920 --> 06:14.320]  I don't have anything.
[06:15.120 --> 06:15.280]  No!
[06:15.280 --> 06:16.480]  Although I do like to wear them.
[06:16.720 --> 06:17.460]  So maybe I'm...
[06:17.460 --> 06:18.560]  Come on, Scooter Gang.
[06:18.580 --> 06:20.660]  Dude, that looks like almost like a pawpaw.
[06:20.680 --> 06:21.320]  He was close.
[06:22.300 --> 06:23.420]  I don't have that though.
[06:23.500 --> 06:24.440]  Anybody see a wheelchair yet?
[06:26.140 --> 06:27.680]  Andrew, how are you feeling about that one?
[06:28.420 --> 06:28.780]  Ghosts!
[06:28.940 --> 06:30.460]  I thankfully don't have it.
[06:30.540 --> 06:31.140]  Anybody have ghosts?
[06:32.240 --> 06:33.380]  No, I don't have anything.
[06:33.760 --> 06:35.300]  I'm looking for dog and a hog.
[06:35.420 --> 06:36.700]  I got dog and a hog on this one.
[06:36.700 --> 06:37.180]  Dog and a hog.
[06:37.480 --> 06:38.400]  Did that lady throw up?
[06:38.740 --> 06:39.020]  Where?
[06:39.260 --> 06:39.840]  With the hat?
[06:40.560 --> 06:40.760]  What?
[06:40.760 --> 06:42.420]  She threw up or spilled something.
[06:42.500 --> 06:43.240]  She might have spilled.
[06:43.480 --> 06:43.560]  Where?
[06:43.820 --> 06:44.460]  Well, spilled is one thing.
[06:44.460 --> 06:46.700]  Yeah, she moved on now, but...
[06:46.700 --> 06:47.560]  Spills, spills.
[06:47.740 --> 06:48.800]  I mean, if you're throwing up,
[06:48.860 --> 06:50.160]  that's technically a spill, isn't it?
[06:50.660 --> 06:51.380]  Oh, that guy's...
[06:51.380 --> 06:52.220]  That's a new one we should do.
[06:52.340 --> 06:53.860]  Fishing for your friend.
[06:54.100 --> 06:54.500]  Is that a luxury car?
[06:54.500 --> 06:55.520]  That's actually a luxury car.
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.360]  That's a luxury car.
[06:56.360 --> 06:56.760]  Yeah, it's a luxury car.
[06:56.780 --> 06:57.220]  What's he doing?
[06:57.240 --> 06:57.880]  Is he throwing something?
[06:57.880 --> 06:58.320]  He's throwing.
[06:58.460 --> 06:58.900]  He's fishing.
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.000]  He's casting his fishing line,
[07:00.040 --> 07:01.160]  then he's pulling him over.
[07:01.740 --> 07:02.600]  Oh, he's got him!
[07:02.880 --> 07:03.640]  Oh, he's got him!
[07:03.640 --> 07:04.240]  He's caught him!
[07:04.240 --> 07:05.060]  He's got him!
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.000]  He's got a live one.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.000]  Don fishing.
[07:07.960 --> 07:09.060]  Oh, we should add that.
[07:09.680 --> 07:10.960]  I've never seen that.
[07:11.120 --> 07:12.000]  Never once.
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.060]  And we'll never see it again.
[07:13.140 --> 07:14.400]  We should add that.
[07:16.320 --> 07:16.740]  Don fishing.
[07:16.960 --> 07:18.580]  A thing that's happened once.
[07:19.140 --> 07:19.420]  Ever.
[07:19.660 --> 07:20.020]  Sure.
[07:21.160 --> 07:22.080]  She said, no, thank you.
[07:22.480 --> 07:23.340]  No, thank you.
[07:23.580 --> 07:24.720]  No, we don't want to go in your bar.
[07:25.160 --> 07:25.720]  We're not interested.
[07:25.740 --> 07:26.460]  No, they had changed that.
[07:26.600 --> 07:27.000]  Oh, is this a...
[07:27.000 --> 07:27.860]  Sunglasses at night?
[07:28.000 --> 07:29.080]  Is sunglasses at night something?
[07:29.700 --> 07:30.820]  Sunglasses at night is one,
[07:30.900 --> 07:31.680]  but I don't have them either.
[07:32.220 --> 07:33.260]  I don't think I have it.
[07:33.500 --> 07:34.300]  Oh, nighttime shades!
[07:34.340 --> 07:34.740]  I do have it.
[07:34.740 --> 07:36.680]  Okay, so do we have...
[07:36.680 --> 07:38.120]  Aggressive honking is gonna be hard
[07:38.120 --> 07:38.900]  when we can't hear it.
[07:39.160 --> 07:39.180]  Yeah.
[07:39.540 --> 07:40.740]  Did we have a drop something?
[07:41.060 --> 07:41.380]  Or was that...
[07:41.380 --> 07:42.760]  Yeah, we've had drop something in the past.
[07:43.400 --> 07:43.720]  I think I have it.
[07:43.720 --> 07:44.380]  No, I mean tonight.
[07:44.620 --> 07:45.500]  Oh, no, I don't see it.
[07:45.500 --> 07:45.780]  Oh, I don't see it.
[07:47.540 --> 07:48.480]  I wish I had, though,
[07:48.560 --> 07:51.320]  because I do have dropped or spilled food or drink.
[07:52.760 --> 07:53.740]  Spilled something dick.
[07:55.240 --> 07:57.720]  It's like quite a chill night out in Key West so far.
[07:57.840 --> 08:00.360]  A nice easy one, but you know it goes in waves.
[08:00.600 --> 08:00.800]  Yeah.
[08:01.020 --> 08:02.100]  I wish we were there,
[08:02.380 --> 08:03.880]  but this is the next best thing.
[08:03.880 --> 08:05.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:05.500 --> 08:07.140]  I don't need to be there quite yet.
[08:08.380 --> 08:10.080]  Oh, that guy looks like he has a sweet stash.
[08:10.220 --> 08:10.840]  Sweet stash.
[08:11.580 --> 08:12.380]  Sweet stash.
[08:12.500 --> 08:13.400]  But let me do this.
[08:13.580 --> 08:15.060]  Oh, look at that!
[08:15.200 --> 08:16.900]  Yeah, sweet stash and matching outfits
[08:16.900 --> 08:18.160]  if anybody has matching outfits.
[08:18.660 --> 08:19.820]  Sweet stash, damn.
[08:20.100 --> 08:20.640]  I'm gonna...
[08:20.640 --> 08:21.340]  Oh, I got a sweet stash.
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.880]  Shrink the chat for a moment.
[08:23.060 --> 08:24.700]  Okay, yeah, do what you need to, Nick.
[08:24.800 --> 08:26.960]  Oh, wow, that's so many matching outfits.
[08:27.100 --> 08:27.360]  Yeah.
[08:28.120 --> 08:28.520]  Wow.
[08:28.560 --> 08:29.640]  Matching outfits, I do have it.
[08:30.780 --> 08:31.140]  Yeah.
[08:32.920 --> 08:34.040]  Sunglasses at night again.
[08:34.200 --> 08:34.360]  Yep.
[08:34.640 --> 08:36.220]  We're adjusting the levels here, guys.
[08:36.380 --> 08:40.200]  Yeah, jeans and flip flops for anybody who has this.
[08:40.600 --> 08:41.800]  I don't, but that's a great one.
[08:41.800 --> 08:42.480]  Is that formal attire?
[08:46.020 --> 08:48.020]  Man, a lot of classics right out the gate tonight.
[08:48.020 --> 08:49.400]  Yeah, some good stuff.
[08:50.440 --> 08:51.880]  That's a kid out way too late.
[08:51.880 --> 08:52.860]  Oh, a kid out way too late.
[08:53.020 --> 08:53.240]  That's a baby.
[08:53.820 --> 08:54.980]  Did we see that it was a kid though?
[08:55.140 --> 08:55.640]  Could have been a dog.
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.320]  What do you mean, what?
[08:56.320 --> 08:56.780]  No, it was a kid.
[08:56.960 --> 08:57.140]  Okay.
[08:57.560 --> 08:58.440]  Could have been a dog.
[08:58.440 --> 09:00.020]  Could have been, kid out late, got it.
[09:00.260 --> 09:01.080]  I don't know why I'm complaining.
[09:02.380 --> 09:02.780]  Kid!
[09:03.740 --> 09:04.220]  Kid, no!
[09:05.300 --> 09:06.600]  Ah, it's a definitive kid.
[09:06.980 --> 09:07.540]  Definitive kid.
[09:07.940 --> 09:10.060]  So many sunglasses tonight, it's ridiculous.
[09:10.460 --> 09:11.560]  Does anyone have Cigar Dad?
[09:15.580 --> 09:16.340]  Cigar Dad!
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.120]  Let me see a bachelorette party.
[09:19.700 --> 09:20.020]  Yeah.
[09:20.700 --> 09:21.800]  That is so loud.
[09:21.920 --> 09:23.600]  Yeah, I'm gonna turn it down.
[09:24.160 --> 09:24.760]  I don't think you can.
[09:24.880 --> 09:25.640]  I don't think I can either.
[09:25.660 --> 09:26.500]  I think it's just two levels.
[09:27.540 --> 09:30.760]  I think you just, you can open the audio mixer.
[09:30.800 --> 09:32.240]  Oh, I have that, Car Underglow.
[09:32.340 --> 09:33.100]  Thank you very much.
[09:33.380 --> 09:33.680]  Oh, Car Underglow.
[09:33.800 --> 09:34.300]  You know what I have?
[09:34.420 --> 09:34.840]  Do it.
[09:35.260 --> 09:35.880]  Do it, Nick.
[09:36.520 --> 09:37.200]  All right, I'm going up.
[09:37.200 --> 09:37.580]  Scooter Gang!
[09:38.020 --> 09:38.620]  Scooter Gang!
[09:38.800 --> 09:39.180]  Go to us.
[09:39.180 --> 09:39.660]  Scooter Gang!
[09:41.320 --> 09:42.220]  Yeah, I'm on us.
[09:42.440 --> 09:42.680]  Okay.
[09:43.000 --> 09:43.260]  Okay.
[09:43.500 --> 09:44.040]  Scooter Gang.
[09:44.320 --> 09:45.420]  There's no sound in there.
[09:45.420 --> 09:46.440]  I know, no, no, no.
[09:46.480 --> 09:48.220]  I'm saying change the camera to us,
[09:48.420 --> 09:49.720]  then go to the audio mixer,
[09:49.900 --> 09:51.940]  and then adjust the audio level.
[09:52.020 --> 09:52.720]  Oh, that's brilliant.
[09:52.780 --> 09:53.380]  And then go back.
[09:53.740 --> 09:54.000]  Yeah.
[09:55.180 --> 09:55.480]  Where are they?
[09:55.860 --> 09:57.200]  What the fuck is going on?
[09:57.200 --> 09:57.860]  They got fire on their car.
[09:58.840 --> 09:59.480]  Jesus Christ.
[10:01.520 --> 10:02.040]  There we go.
[10:02.060 --> 10:02.500]  I love it.
[10:02.660 --> 10:04.460]  But I want to make sure we can still hear Andrew.
[10:04.800 --> 10:05.780]  That's, Andrew, you okay?
[10:07.480 --> 10:07.800]  Yeah.
[10:08.580 --> 10:09.760]  Turn it down, fuck.
[10:10.380 --> 10:12.400]  Just open the, open the...
[10:12.400 --> 10:14.040]  Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[10:16.500 --> 10:17.600]  Is that a beach goth?
[10:18.440 --> 10:19.860]  Oh, I would say...
[10:19.860 --> 10:19.880]  Yeah.
[10:20.180 --> 10:21.560]  Ah, yeah, yeah.
[10:22.200 --> 10:22.460]  Better?
[10:22.480 --> 10:23.200]  Yeah, that's good.
[10:23.320 --> 10:23.740]  You're good there.
[10:23.880 --> 10:24.080]  Okay.
[10:24.240 --> 10:25.160]  Full strain and kick it back out.
[10:25.160 --> 10:25.800]  Yep, sorry about that.
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.460]  All right, let me take it.
[10:26.900 --> 10:28.840]  Just wanted to make sure we had the audio.
[10:28.900 --> 10:29.420]  Oh, tricycle.
[10:29.620 --> 10:30.420]  Aggressive honking.
[10:30.540 --> 10:31.140]  Got that too.
[10:31.380 --> 10:32.120]  Andrew, you still good?
[10:33.060 --> 10:34.020]  Ooh, I need a handshake.
[10:34.300 --> 10:35.020]  I don't know why I yelled too much.
[10:35.020 --> 10:35.940]  You can't really hear you guys
[10:35.940 --> 10:37.000]  when you talk at the same time.
[10:37.540 --> 10:38.380]  Yeah, sorry.
[10:40.120 --> 10:41.680]  No, no, I just mean like the mic.
[10:41.840 --> 10:42.940]  Like I think it's a game thing.
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.340]  Like it's canceling out.
[10:44.460 --> 10:44.820]  Hiya.
[10:45.400 --> 10:46.300]  Acknowledging the camera.
[10:49.200 --> 10:49.920]  Another underglow.
[10:50.440 --> 10:50.740]  Yeah.
[10:53.480 --> 10:54.200]  Rented scooter.
[10:59.820 --> 11:00.220]  Yeah.
[11:00.220 --> 11:00.860]  Nobody's hoofing it.
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.800]  No, so far, so far taking it slow.
[11:05.520 --> 11:05.700]  Yeah.
[11:06.020 --> 11:07.120]  Oh, I've got fist bump.
[11:07.180 --> 11:08.280]  I haven't even been looking for that.
[11:08.360 --> 11:09.200]  Well, we still have what?
[11:09.320 --> 11:10.520]  30 minutes till slop o'clock.
[11:10.560 --> 11:13.040]  Okay, until it really kicks off, you know.
[11:13.320 --> 11:15.220]  So far I've got sweet stash, beach goth,
[11:15.340 --> 11:17.340]  kid out late, head sheen, nighttime shades,
[11:17.440 --> 11:18.020]  matching outfits.
[11:18.240 --> 11:18.640]  Wow.
[11:18.800 --> 11:19.080]  Wow.
[11:20.220 --> 11:22.420]  I have scooter gang, kid out late, head sheen,
[11:22.460 --> 11:23.420]  and dumb hat.
[11:23.940 --> 11:26.760]  I have beach goth, tricycle, car underglow,
[11:26.860 --> 11:27.640]  and kid out late.
[11:27.800 --> 11:29.960]  This is going to be hard because I got dog and hog
[11:29.960 --> 11:31.440]  and crying on the same line.
[11:31.520 --> 11:33.120]  There's just no fucking shot.
[11:33.220 --> 11:34.580]  Dog and a hog though, when we get it.
[11:34.680 --> 11:35.840]  Oh, it's going to be so annoying.
[11:36.300 --> 11:38.380]  It's going to be my personal bingo.
[11:38.660 --> 11:39.540]  That's an offensive shirt.
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.720]  I'm not gay.
[11:41.980 --> 11:42.640]  I'm offended.
[11:43.760 --> 11:44.480]  I don't know if I was offended.
[11:44.480 --> 11:46.340]  Double fisting, double fisting, double fisting.
[11:47.260 --> 11:48.480]  Oh, that's a double fist.
[11:48.600 --> 11:53.000]  Oh, yeah, here we go.
[11:53.600 --> 11:54.960]  This guy's got a gurgler.
[11:56.020 --> 11:56.780]  Is that?
[12:00.240 --> 12:01.120]  Hell yeah.
[12:01.260 --> 12:02.360]  Acknowledge the camera.
[12:03.340 --> 12:04.220]  Double fisting.
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.940]  That's the camera with the gurgler.
[12:06.000 --> 12:06.660]  And a chug.
[12:07.160 --> 12:07.600]  And a chug.
[12:08.380 --> 12:09.180]  Fuck it, of course.
[12:09.380 --> 12:10.500]  I don't have any of these things.
[12:10.680 --> 12:11.560]  I'm so...
[12:12.340 --> 12:12.780]  Sunglasses.
[12:12.880 --> 12:14.140]  We'll see you next time, buddy.
[12:14.780 --> 12:15.020]  Love it.
[12:15.160 --> 12:15.760]  That was phenomenal.
[12:15.760 --> 12:16.800]  That's been so fucking awesome.
[12:16.960 --> 12:18.380]  Dude, chat's going crazy.
[12:18.460 --> 12:19.480]  Love that guy.
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.220]  What a hero.
[12:21.040 --> 12:21.740]  What a hero.
[12:22.380 --> 12:22.740]  Wow.
[12:23.120 --> 12:23.940]  He didn't twerk.
[12:24.000 --> 12:24.920]  He could've twerked more.
[12:25.180 --> 12:26.440]  He would've appreciated a twerk.
[12:26.500 --> 12:27.560]  I think he could've dropped something,
[12:27.700 --> 12:28.400]  but, you know, it was just me.
[12:30.180 --> 12:32.180]  Have I seen any obviously dyed hair?
[12:32.280 --> 12:32.980]  No, not yet.
[12:33.160 --> 12:34.480]  I'm looking for a sports jersey.
[12:35.140 --> 12:36.220]  Cheetah, thanks for the subs.
[12:38.280 --> 12:39.880]  Sports jerseys should be more common.
[12:40.040 --> 12:40.980]  You would think so.
[12:41.000 --> 12:41.240]  I know.
[12:41.360 --> 12:42.680]  Especially in Florida.
[12:42.960 --> 12:43.420]  I know.
[12:46.570 --> 12:47.670]  Is that gerpal clothing?
[12:48.310 --> 12:49.070]  It's pretty close.
[12:49.070 --> 12:50.170]  Oh, it is close, yeah.
[12:50.790 --> 12:52.430]  Andrew, would you give me gerpal clothing on that?
[12:53.290 --> 12:54.810]  Yeah, go ahead.
[12:55.570 --> 12:56.130]  Really?
[12:57.190 --> 12:57.830]  I'll take it.
[12:59.350 --> 13:00.310]  Gavin disagrees.
[13:00.890 --> 13:03.250]  And we were saying that the gay shirt was offensive.
[13:03.430 --> 13:03.870]  Yeah, definitely.
[13:04.570 --> 13:07.750]  You know how you just said that?
[13:07.770 --> 13:10.850]  Would the gay shirt be considered formal attire?
[13:13.490 --> 13:15.670]  We still haven't settled that one, have we?
[13:21.580 --> 13:22.880]  I'm, like, locked in.
[13:23.240 --> 13:24.580]  Yeah, pretty hard locked in.
[13:24.580 --> 13:26.680]  Did you feel like a bug was on you?
[13:27.240 --> 13:27.780]  Yeah, it was tickling.
[13:28.900 --> 13:30.640]  Yeah, what, was that a Tupac shirt?
[13:30.900 --> 13:33.360]  Oh, that was my Salads shorts as a skirt.
[13:34.240 --> 13:36.500]  That was the second Tupac shirt I've seen tonight.
[13:37.020 --> 13:37.420]  Crazy.
[13:38.120 --> 13:39.120]  We need to throw him in the mix.
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.260]  The later we get into the night,
[13:43.340 --> 13:45.820]  the more like everybody looks like a GTA NPC.
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.040]  It's really smooshy.
[13:47.120 --> 13:47.880]  Oh, big time.
[13:49.500 --> 13:51.000]  Oh, is someone getting in a car?
[13:51.120 --> 13:51.560]  Oh, yeah.
[13:51.760 --> 13:52.660]  Is that a pickup?
[13:54.780 --> 13:56.100]  If anybody has it.
[13:56.900 --> 13:57.800]  Damn, I don't.
[13:57.960 --> 13:59.560]  I think we need another round of discussion
[13:59.560 --> 14:01.100]  with the Falcons about the fronts.
[14:01.620 --> 14:02.700]  Take some out, add some in.
[14:02.900 --> 14:04.400]  Yeah, we should 2025 it.
[14:04.540 --> 14:06.820]  Yeah, we need to update this board.
[14:07.240 --> 14:08.280]  Why is he walking like that?
[14:08.580 --> 14:10.200]  What we need to do is...
[14:10.200 --> 14:11.940]  Oh, cop, cop, copper, cop.
[14:12.460 --> 14:14.140]  Oh, I have cop car ambulance.
[14:14.300 --> 14:14.940]  Oh, street cop?
[14:15.760 --> 14:16.200]  Street cop.
[14:16.320 --> 14:16.660]  Yeah.
[14:18.220 --> 14:19.080]  Do you have street cop?
[14:19.180 --> 14:19.640]  I do have street cop.
[14:19.640 --> 14:20.160]  Hell yeah, dude.
[14:20.300 --> 14:21.240]  Damn, look at this.
[14:21.320 --> 14:21.760]  Not bad, right?
[14:21.800 --> 14:23.920]  I think we need to play it a few times
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.680]  to see what's, you know...
[14:25.680 --> 14:26.000]  Yeah.
[14:26.580 --> 14:27.460]  I like dirt, look at this.
[14:27.460 --> 14:29.240]  What the vibe of 2025 is.
[14:31.560 --> 14:32.000]  Scooter.
[14:33.820 --> 14:34.820]  Oh, we can see...
[14:34.900 --> 14:35.800]  We can see a phone call.
[14:36.120 --> 14:39.000]  Is this guy getting into a fight with the Falcons?
[14:39.020 --> 14:39.660]  Look like it.
[14:40.240 --> 14:40.540]  Yeah.
[14:41.200 --> 14:42.440]  Dumb hat, by the way.
[14:44.160 --> 14:45.220]  Cop car, that's mine.
[14:45.920 --> 14:46.660]  Yeah, there you go.
[14:47.920 --> 14:50.560]  Why do people always do this with the phone and then this?
[14:51.560 --> 14:52.880]  Because he's on speakerphone.
[14:52.880 --> 14:54.220]  Yeah, but just don't do speakerphone.
[14:54.300 --> 14:54.780]  You'll be able to hear him.
[14:54.980 --> 14:55.600]  I totally agree.
[14:55.720 --> 14:57.640]  Why do people have to have a conversation
[14:57.640 --> 14:58.760]  in public on speakerphone?
[14:58.940 --> 15:01.280]  I never understood the inconvenience of doing this.
[15:01.380 --> 15:02.300]  And or FaceTime.
[15:02.440 --> 15:04.180]  Why are they doing FaceTime so loud in public?
[15:05.320 --> 15:06.260]  Oh, please do FaceTime.
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.640]  No, it was a regular phone call.
[15:07.680 --> 15:09.800]  I don't know why he's wearing those shorts
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.000]  and that shirt, they clash.
[15:12.140 --> 15:13.740]  It's non-complementary stripes.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.100]  Speakerphone shouldn't exist.
[15:16.200 --> 15:16.940]  I think I agree with that.
[15:16.960 --> 15:18.160]  I totally agree with that.
[15:19.640 --> 15:20.980]  It sounds like shit.
[15:20.980 --> 15:23.000]  It's like a pod of herring and you desperately need it.
[15:23.460 --> 15:24.440]  I wish he would twerk.
[15:25.340 --> 15:26.680]  I'm glad he's not.
[15:28.800 --> 15:30.120]  Just because you don't want me to win.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.540]  Well, that's one reason.
[15:32.740 --> 15:33.780]  You think that guy in the gray shirt
[15:33.780 --> 15:34.940]  looks like anybody famous?
[15:38.120 --> 15:38.560]  Butterbean.
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.080]  Scooter gang, in case you missed it earlier.
[15:45.320 --> 15:45.580]  Yeah.
[15:48.820 --> 15:50.100]  Someone said Don Zimmer.
[15:50.980 --> 15:51.320]  Ah!
[15:55.420 --> 15:57.240]  God, can I get a fucking wheelchair?
[15:57.740 --> 15:58.900]  I thought she was waving to the camera.
[15:58.960 --> 15:59.460]  Come with me.
[15:59.760 --> 16:00.640]  Oh, twerk, twerk.
[16:00.920 --> 16:01.080]  Mm.
[16:01.380 --> 16:01.660]  No.
[16:03.640 --> 16:04.080]  Whoa.
[16:04.400 --> 16:05.520]  That cop's just chilling, huh?
[16:05.980 --> 16:07.720]  He doesn't look enough like Don Zimmer.
[16:08.400 --> 16:09.460]  No, not quite.
[16:12.180 --> 16:13.840]  Maybe if he had a green army helmet on
[16:13.840 --> 16:14.600]  and a Yankee shirt.
[16:16.340 --> 16:16.780]  Whoa.
[16:17.020 --> 16:18.520]  Why is the cop doing that?
[16:18.520 --> 16:21.140]  The cop's trying to make everyone forget.
[16:21.720 --> 16:21.840]  Hey!
[16:26.060 --> 16:27.200]  No formal attire.
[16:27.520 --> 16:28.900]  Is he doing that just to the camera?
[16:29.280 --> 16:30.760]  Yeah, he's being, yeah, kind of shocking.
[16:30.920 --> 16:31.660]  He's being a dick.
[16:35.420 --> 16:36.380]  An AirPod.
[16:36.620 --> 16:37.460]  San Antonio shirt.
[16:39.440 --> 16:39.760]  Huh.
[16:41.560 --> 16:44.520]  All these women are just too young to be Neymars.
[16:44.820 --> 16:47.320]  The way he's dragging that lady, she's close.
[16:47.320 --> 16:48.960]  I thought the same thing.
[16:51.540 --> 16:52.520]  Oh, cool.
[16:52.720 --> 16:53.060]  Cop's back.
[16:53.160 --> 16:54.720]  That dick-ass cop is back.
[16:56.220 --> 16:58.040]  I just need his car.
[16:59.020 --> 17:00.140]  Get in your car.
[17:01.400 --> 17:02.500]  Drive by.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.840]  Jeans and flip-flops again.
[17:17.640 --> 17:19.540]  Is he, like, hiding?
[17:19.980 --> 17:21.420]  Or what is his plan?
[17:25.820 --> 17:26.920]  Oh, she's about to chug.
[17:27.040 --> 17:27.280]  Is that?
[17:27.420 --> 17:28.220]  Yeah, she's chugging.
[17:28.300 --> 17:28.900]  She's chugging.
[17:29.120 --> 17:29.660]  She spilled.
[17:30.040 --> 17:30.840]  Spilled through the sink.
[17:31.160 --> 17:31.200]  Oh!
[17:32.260 --> 17:33.000]  Got it.
[17:33.620 --> 17:34.420]  Thank you.
[17:34.540 --> 17:35.880]  Does a delivery spill count?
[17:37.140 --> 17:37.800]  Is that a pizza?
[17:37.920 --> 17:38.820]  If anybody has pizza, I can't remember.
[17:38.820 --> 17:39.500]  She dropped ice.
[17:39.580 --> 17:39.940]  Does that count?
[17:39.940 --> 17:41.240]  Yeah, she dropped something.
[17:41.380 --> 17:43.920]  Mine says, dropped, spilled, food, and drink.
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.200]  That was definitely dropped.
[17:45.520 --> 17:46.000]  That's fair.
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.320]  Does dropped something count?
[17:47.420 --> 17:47.620]  Yeah.
[17:48.020 --> 17:48.400]  Sweet.
[17:48.720 --> 17:48.940]  I'm in.
[17:49.900 --> 17:51.680]  If someone walks past three plus times,
[17:51.700 --> 17:52.220]  I've got a bingo.
[17:53.300 --> 17:54.140]  I need a bingo now.
[17:54.400 --> 17:55.540]  The cop's come and gone once.
[17:55.540 --> 17:56.800]  If I get a wheelchair, I get a bingo.
[17:57.000 --> 17:58.800]  I need a bandage, dude, and a dog.
[17:59.220 --> 17:59.940]  Double fisting.
[18:00.720 --> 18:01.220]  Oh, was...
[18:01.220 --> 18:02.760]  Do I have the...
[18:02.760 --> 18:04.860]  Oh, I haven't even been looking for sport jersey.
[18:04.980 --> 18:05.360]  Me neither.
[18:05.400 --> 18:06.000]  Yeah, no, I need it.
[18:06.000 --> 18:06.800]  You haven't been either.
[18:08.220 --> 18:10.720]  Although, if I could get a sucking on chili dog.
[18:12.120 --> 18:14.280]  One of the fuck-face hot dogs are still there.
[18:16.060 --> 18:17.240]  How crazy was that?
[18:17.900 --> 18:19.400]  Did we go all the way down to Key West
[18:19.400 --> 18:20.740]  and the guy who sells hot dogs,
[18:20.960 --> 18:22.840]  which weren't even a thing for us yet,
[18:23.380 --> 18:25.260]  was selling fuck-face clothing.
[18:25.260 --> 18:27.440]  That had nothing to do with us.
[18:27.880 --> 18:29.660]  And now here we are two years later,
[18:29.960 --> 18:31.680]  and we put our hot dog count on our signature,
[18:32.200 --> 18:33.220]  and we're no longer hot dogs.
[18:33.220 --> 18:34.780]  Was that the North Face parody?
[18:34.980 --> 18:35.200]  Yeah.
[18:43.260 --> 18:44.740]  It'll be Nemo soon enough.
[18:48.480 --> 18:48.900]  God.
[18:51.720 --> 18:53.220]  So, where did all the dogs go?
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.100]  Somebody let them out.
[19:00.820 --> 19:01.600]  There's Gus.
[19:01.600 --> 19:01.640]  Sloppy Joe, look at Gus.
[19:01.780 --> 19:02.580]  Sloppy Joe, look at Gus.
[19:02.680 --> 19:03.240]  Sloppy Joe, look at Gus.
[19:04.960 --> 19:06.160]  Is that full on tie?
[19:06.320 --> 19:07.060]  Is that full on tie?
[19:07.060 --> 19:07.220]  No.
[19:08.220 --> 19:09.380]  If he was wearing a jacket.
[19:10.160 --> 19:12.420]  Oh, he turned around in short sleeves.
[19:13.580 --> 19:14.700]  Not a short sleeves guy?
[19:14.840 --> 19:15.640]  Not for a button up.
[19:17.400 --> 19:19.000]  Oh, it was not a tucked in button up.
[19:19.320 --> 19:20.900]  Got some luxury cards going.
[19:21.920 --> 19:23.340]  In case you missed it earlier.
[19:23.540 --> 19:25.180]  Thank you for joining us for Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[19:25.860 --> 19:28.380]  If you watched us earlier, we played Mario Kart.
[19:29.120 --> 19:29.920]  Pretty poorly.
[19:30.760 --> 19:31.920]  That was pretty brutal.
[19:32.120 --> 19:32.820]  That was pretty bad.
[19:33.700 --> 19:34.720]  Maybe that could be on it.
[19:34.820 --> 19:34.920]  It's fun.
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.160]  It was fun.
[19:38.300 --> 19:40.080]  I don't think I could ever get good at that.
[19:40.300 --> 19:41.120]  No, I think I'm...
[19:41.120 --> 19:42.320]  I think I'm already at my ceiling.
[19:42.640 --> 19:44.480]  I think that's a game where you're born good at it,
[19:44.500 --> 19:44.960]  or not at all.
[19:44.980 --> 19:47.480]  Nah, you can learn the pipes and the shortcuts and that.
[19:47.600 --> 19:48.360]  That is great.
[19:48.640 --> 19:49.320]  That is as good as I get.
[19:49.720 --> 19:51.560]  That'll knock me up two places, maybe.
[19:57.320 --> 19:57.780]  Is that camo?
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.960]  We were on a split screen, too.
[20:00.320 --> 20:01.260]  Is that camo show?
[20:01.260 --> 20:03.880]  I think they're pineapples or something.
[20:04.800 --> 20:06.360]  It's like a shirt full of air freshness.
[20:06.360 --> 20:06.760]  Gang signs.
[20:08.220 --> 20:09.020]  Made your luck.
[20:09.400 --> 20:09.960]  Two for flinching.
[20:10.600 --> 20:12.420]  I shaved my balls for this.
[20:12.520 --> 20:14.140]  This is actually my first rodeo.
[20:14.720 --> 20:18.920]  That guy looked like someone Chris Hansen spoke to once.
[20:20.000 --> 20:20.980]  Is that guy was a celebrity?
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.080]  Come in, take a seat.
[20:23.260 --> 20:23.480]  No.
[20:25.260 --> 20:27.020]  Maybe if you saw what Chris Hansen looked like.
[20:27.260 --> 20:27.940]  Oh, that'd be me.
[20:28.020 --> 20:28.920]  Or just Chris Hansen.
[20:29.040 --> 20:29.200]  Yeah.
[20:29.730 --> 20:31.660]  Anybody see the obviously dyed hair?
[20:32.420 --> 20:33.000]  No, not really.
[20:33.280 --> 20:33.380]  No.
[20:33.520 --> 20:34.280]  Not yet.
[20:34.780 --> 20:35.580]  It'd be cool if we did though, right?
[20:35.580 --> 20:36.480]  Not that it's registered.
[20:39.660 --> 20:42.180]  The color hues are harder to see with the lights on.
[20:43.280 --> 20:44.200]  With the lights on?
[20:44.200 --> 20:44.440]  Uh-huh.
[20:44.620 --> 20:44.780]  Yeah.
[20:45.820 --> 20:46.400]  Hoofing it!
[20:46.640 --> 20:46.820]  Oh!
[20:47.500 --> 20:48.100]  Was that?
[20:48.300 --> 20:49.620]  Oh, she was hoofing it.
[20:49.640 --> 20:50.100]  She hoofed it.
[20:50.200 --> 20:50.920]  Yeah, she sure did.
[20:51.100 --> 20:52.240]  Not for long, but she hoofed it.
[20:52.420 --> 20:53.780]  That was like a hoof burst.
[20:55.340 --> 20:56.480]  A hoof burst?
[20:57.340 --> 20:59.760]  She just didn't have a lot of stamina on her bar yet.
[21:00.080 --> 21:01.160]  Looks like a player.
[21:01.420 --> 21:02.380]  That's one of us, right?
[21:03.000 --> 21:03.400]  Yes.
[21:04.180 --> 21:04.780]  Oh, right.
[21:04.880 --> 21:05.400]  Oh, hoofing it!
[21:05.760 --> 21:06.760]  Oh, that's another hoof.
[21:06.760 --> 21:07.280]  Another hoof.
[21:09.500 --> 21:10.660]  Oh, what's going on?
[21:11.000 --> 21:11.540]  Itchy foot?
[21:11.920 --> 21:12.220]  Boot!
[21:12.380 --> 21:12.940]  She's got a boot!
[21:13.160 --> 21:14.060]  There you go, Eric.
[21:14.140 --> 21:14.980]  Is that bandage, dude?
[21:15.100 --> 21:16.020]  Yeah, that counts as a bandage.
[21:16.480 --> 21:17.380]  That's not a bandage.
[21:17.400 --> 21:17.680]  Yes, it is.
[21:17.680 --> 21:18.200]  That's a boot.
[21:18.340 --> 21:19.140]  It's the same thing.
[21:19.300 --> 21:19.900]  It's the same thing.
[21:20.460 --> 21:21.560]  It's always counted as a bandage.
[21:21.560 --> 21:23.140]  Come on, dog!
[21:24.600 --> 21:26.720]  Show me a dog!
[21:26.900 --> 21:28.360]  Show me a wheelchair!
[21:29.200 --> 21:29.940]  Not dog and a hog?
[21:30.100 --> 21:31.560]  I need dog and dog on a hog.
[21:31.760 --> 21:33.640]  But I just go, if I got dog, I got bingo.
[21:33.900 --> 21:34.940]  It's not dog on a hog.
[21:35.280 --> 21:36.380]  Dog and hog.
[21:36.400 --> 21:37.140]  I said dog and a hog.
[21:37.300 --> 21:38.460]  Okay, I thought Eric said on a hog.
[21:38.460 --> 21:38.760]  Hog dog?
[21:40.520 --> 21:42.020]  Hoggy doggy and doggy daddy.
[21:42.580 --> 21:42.780]  Oh.
[21:43.740 --> 21:45.220]  It's my favorite Snoop Dogg nickname.
[21:45.540 --> 21:46.660]  Come on, roll on through.
[21:46.880 --> 21:47.840]  Roll on through.
[21:48.560 --> 21:49.620]  Roll me to victory.
[21:50.720 --> 21:52.020]  Come on, dog!
[21:52.760 --> 21:53.320]  Fanny pack!
[21:54.440 --> 21:55.040]  Come on.
[21:55.180 --> 21:56.220]  Ooh, a fanny pack.
[21:57.880 --> 21:58.480]  It's Philly's fan.
[21:58.820 --> 21:58.980]  Ooh.
[21:59.040 --> 21:59.720]  It's a sports thing.
[22:00.800 --> 22:01.000]  Nice.
[22:01.000 --> 22:01.940]  I guess it's just a hat, though.
[22:02.260 --> 22:03.040]  That's a classic T-shirt.
[22:03.040 --> 22:03.680]  Ooh, are they still winning?
[22:03.820 --> 22:05.000]  She's wearing camo pants.
[22:05.120 --> 22:06.300]  Oh, I've got carrying an instrument.
[22:06.400 --> 22:07.180]  He's got one on his shirt.
[22:07.220 --> 22:07.600]  Does that count?
[22:07.800 --> 22:07.960]  No.
[22:08.180 --> 22:09.460]  That was ridiculous.
[22:09.500 --> 22:09.800]  Hey, Eric.
[22:10.160 --> 22:10.340]  Yeah?
[22:10.780 --> 22:11.620]  I think they're doing okay.
[22:12.360 --> 22:12.600]  Nice.
[22:13.220 --> 22:13.480]  11 to nothing.
[22:13.520 --> 22:14.080]  Wave at the camera!
[22:14.320 --> 22:14.960]  After a delay.
[22:17.140 --> 22:18.120]  After a rain delay.
[22:18.160 --> 22:19.560]  Oh, they've walked past twice now,
[22:19.600 --> 22:20.760]  so if they do that again.
[22:20.760 --> 22:21.020]  Yep.
[22:21.100 --> 22:21.360]  Yep.
[22:21.940 --> 22:22.380]  You all right?
[22:22.460 --> 22:23.700]  Who, the backwards hat fellas?
[22:23.900 --> 22:25.300]  Yeah, the matching outfits boys.
[22:26.860 --> 22:28.340]  Where's all the bachelorette parties?
[22:29.860 --> 22:30.460]  Next door.
[22:35.080 --> 22:36.840]  Oh my God, show me a dog!
[22:39.760 --> 22:41.200]  Show me a wheelchair.
[22:42.240 --> 22:42.700]  Eric, I'm not sure.
[22:42.720 --> 22:43.360]  That's a dog!
[22:43.560 --> 22:44.580]  That's a dog in the back!
[22:44.580 --> 22:45.340]  Yeah, that's, yep.
[22:45.520 --> 22:46.160]  That's a dog on the back of the scooter.
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.720]  That's a dog in the back of the scooter tricycle.
[22:48.960 --> 22:49.700]  That's a bingo!
[22:49.940 --> 22:50.380]  Wait, wait, wait.
[22:50.380 --> 22:51.760]  Wait, wait, wait.
[22:51.900 --> 22:53.000]  It could be another animal.
[22:53.140 --> 22:53.760]  Hold on, stop.
[22:53.780 --> 22:54.560]  Hold on, let's see.
[22:54.640 --> 22:54.920]  Let's see.
[22:55.140 --> 22:55.780]  It's a dog!
[22:55.900 --> 22:56.920]  No, we can't tell.
[22:56.920 --> 22:57.680]  It could be a snake.
[22:58.160 --> 22:59.880]  It could be a cat panting.
[22:59.900 --> 23:02.060]  Is that a, is that, it looks like an English bulldog.
[23:02.260 --> 23:02.920]  Tough to tell.
[23:03.160 --> 23:04.940]  Hold on, it's, we're gonna get a bad look at it.
[23:05.220 --> 23:05.940]  What do you think, Andrew?
[23:06.340 --> 23:06.980]  That's a dog.
[23:07.080 --> 23:07.920]  That could be a baby.
[23:08.320 --> 23:08.640]  Raccoon.
[23:08.680 --> 23:09.600]  Oh, is that a baby?
[23:09.840 --> 23:10.240]  A raccoon!
[23:10.240 --> 23:11.080]  I think it's a dog.
[23:11.460 --> 23:11.780]  Yeah!
[23:11.780 --> 23:13.820]  Is it a raccoon though?
[23:13.900 --> 23:14.440]  Zooming in hot.
[23:14.520 --> 23:15.760]  Move out the way, Pickle!
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.080]  I'm afraid that we'll have to let it go.
[23:18.540 --> 23:18.820]  Dog!
[23:18.940 --> 23:19.680]  We didn't.
[23:20.040 --> 23:20.440]  No, I don't think.
[23:20.460 --> 23:22.000]  It's a bingo, boys.
[23:22.380 --> 23:22.660]  Not yet.
[23:23.660 --> 23:24.460]  Seems like a dog.
[23:24.500 --> 23:26.760]  A lot of people said it seems like a dog, but it's,
[23:26.880 --> 23:28.240]  or a baby, I'm seeing babies.
[23:28.340 --> 23:28.700]  Lots of baby.
[23:28.700 --> 23:29.820]  A lot of people think it's a baby.
[23:29.940 --> 23:31.180]  Babies do pant when it's hot.
[23:31.340 --> 23:33.480]  I don't think a baby would be not in a chair.
[23:33.660 --> 23:34.860]  And it is 84 degrees there.
[23:34.860 --> 23:35.940]  That'd be a kid out late.
[23:36.300 --> 23:36.580]  Yeah.
[23:37.480 --> 23:38.040]  All right, here we go.
[23:38.180 --> 23:40.920]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:41.040 --> 23:41.540]  It's a dog.
[23:41.620 --> 23:42.500]  No, it looks like a cat.
[23:42.720 --> 23:43.020]  Is it?
[23:43.020 --> 23:44.320]  Is it though?
[23:44.620 --> 23:44.900]  No.
[23:47.720 --> 23:48.120]  Idiots.
[23:49.660 --> 23:52.500]  Yeah, that's a bingo, boys.
[23:52.620 --> 23:53.180]  Look at this.
[23:53.580 --> 23:55.500]  Look at the, the cop is a real bastard.
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.600]  Dog, girl with a bandage, dude.
[23:57.920 --> 24:00.660]  Scooter gang, and dropped spilled food and drank.
[24:01.080 --> 24:01.840]  The bingo's done.
[24:01.900 --> 24:02.420]  You win every time.
[24:02.640 --> 24:04.260]  The bingo's done again, boys.
[24:04.320 --> 24:05.320]  Eric wins a cake.
[24:05.560 --> 24:06.560]  You gonna generate new boards?
[24:06.640 --> 24:07.720]  You guys, you wanna just generate?
[24:07.840 --> 24:08.280]  Go again, Andrew?
[24:08.280 --> 24:09.080]  Yeah, let's just go again.
[24:09.800 --> 24:10.000]  Andrew?
[24:12.540 --> 24:12.940]  Andrew.
[24:12.940 --> 24:13.300]  Andrew.
[24:14.560 --> 24:16.400]  Oh my God, he's dead.
[24:18.540 --> 24:18.980]  Andrew?
[24:19.740 --> 24:20.860]  Did you hang up on him?
[24:22.400 --> 24:22.840]  No.
[24:24.420 --> 24:25.280]  Is he still there?
[24:25.340 --> 24:25.940]  He's here.
[24:26.140 --> 24:27.180]  His avatar is.
[24:27.840 --> 24:28.620]  His avatar?
[24:30.960 --> 24:31.980]  Chat, where's Andrew?
[24:32.580 --> 24:33.020]  Andrew?
[24:33.660 --> 24:34.460]  Is chat here?
[24:35.580 --> 24:36.100]  There's a dog.
[24:36.140 --> 24:37.080]  There's another dog right there.
[24:37.120 --> 24:37.480]  There you go.
[24:37.540 --> 24:38.200]  God damn it.
[24:38.620 --> 24:39.300]  It's dog city now.
[24:39.300 --> 24:40.600]  I already restarted mine.
[24:40.700 --> 24:41.740]  Oh, you already, you already generated?
[24:41.740 --> 24:43.020]  Well, we gotta wait for Nick.
[24:43.400 --> 24:44.500]  We have to wait for Nick and Andrew.
[24:44.620 --> 24:45.700]  Oh, and you have to refresh.
[24:46.360 --> 24:46.620]  Fuck!
[24:48.360 --> 24:49.920]  At least it happened between games.
[24:50.300 --> 24:50.880]  Yeah, that's true.
[24:51.800 --> 24:52.120]  Andrew?
[24:54.040 --> 24:54.800]  Is he gone?
[24:54.960 --> 24:55.640]  I miss him.
[24:57.960 --> 24:58.740]  Wait, Andrew, are you there?
[25:00.500 --> 25:01.740]  I got no...
[25:01.740 --> 25:02.420]  No, nothing, right?
[25:02.480 --> 25:02.780]  Nothing.
[25:03.000 --> 25:04.480]  He might've just stepped away for a piss.
[25:04.540 --> 25:05.800]  Yeah, Andrew, if you're...
[25:06.360 --> 25:07.440]  Are you, like, in chat?
[25:13.290 --> 25:15.090]  Well, anyway, while we're waiting for Andrew,
[25:15.270 --> 25:17.230]  we can make fun of these people a little bit.
[25:17.230 --> 25:18.950]  I'm gonna see if I can finish up my board by the way.
[25:19.350 --> 25:19.950]  Yeah, why not?
[25:20.050 --> 25:21.370]  I wish I hadn't refreshed mine already.
[25:21.770 --> 25:22.110]  Shablet.
[25:22.250 --> 25:24.930]  Look at those outrageous rims.
[25:25.170 --> 25:25.670]  Oh, here we go.
[25:25.730 --> 25:27.890]  Eric said, Andrew, are you there?
[25:28.110 --> 25:29.470]  Well, yeah, I know it's Slack.
[25:29.690 --> 25:29.910]  Yeah.
[25:30.790 --> 25:32.030]  I haven't heard from him yet, though.
[25:35.430 --> 25:36.350]  I hope he's okay.
[25:37.390 --> 25:38.490]  But fucking weird.
[25:38.490 --> 25:38.630]  Weird.
[25:41.950 --> 25:43.650]  What kind of cake do you guys want to eat together?
[25:44.030 --> 25:45.990]  Oh my God, I thought you'd never ask.
[25:46.150 --> 25:46.770]  Oh my God.
[25:47.010 --> 25:47.510]  Ice cream cake.
[25:47.730 --> 25:49.150]  You know how much I love chocolate cake.
[25:54.250 --> 25:55.230]  Is that formal wear?
[25:56.050 --> 25:56.850]  It's gold.
[25:57.250 --> 25:59.990]  I would, I don't know that anything here is formal.
[26:00.310 --> 26:02.570]  I don't think gold equals formal.
[26:03.910 --> 26:05.290]  That could be bachelorette there.
[26:05.830 --> 26:07.370]  That's gotta be a bachelorette party.
[26:07.390 --> 26:08.410]  I would think so.
[26:08.410 --> 26:10.350]  Although, like, we're not playing right now.
[26:10.490 --> 26:10.870]  Look at this guy.
[26:10.870 --> 26:11.790]  Look at this guy.
[26:11.870 --> 26:12.890]  What the fuck?
[26:13.070 --> 26:14.070]  Jesus Christ.
[26:14.370 --> 26:15.650]  That was a dumb hat.
[26:16.230 --> 26:16.530]  Wow.
[26:16.650 --> 26:17.070]  That was dumb everything.
[26:17.070 --> 26:19.010]  Well, let's generate a new board and go.
[26:19.110 --> 26:19.570]  We'll wait for it.
[26:19.650 --> 26:23.310]  I mean, Andrew will catch up once he's back.
[26:25.230 --> 26:26.090]  All right, we generate.
[26:26.210 --> 26:26.890]  I texted him.
[26:27.010 --> 26:27.410]  I've heard nothing.
[26:27.990 --> 26:29.050]  Yeah, we'll just wait.
[26:29.230 --> 26:30.030]  Let's generate a new board.
[26:30.190 --> 26:30.730]  You want to have a seat?
[26:30.850 --> 26:33.030]  Eric said something that offended Andrew and he left.
[26:33.050 --> 26:34.450]  Yeah, I said bingo and he got pissed.
[26:35.370 --> 26:36.350]  Nick, you want to have a seat?
[26:36.670 --> 26:37.330]  I would love to.
[26:37.330 --> 26:38.210]  What's the...
[26:40.630 --> 26:40.950]  Nevermind.
[26:41.210 --> 26:41.810]  Frequency Kenneth?
[26:43.570 --> 26:45.010]  All right, generate a new one.
[26:45.170 --> 26:45.490]  What happened?
[26:46.450 --> 26:47.790]  Yeah, generate a new board.
[26:48.210 --> 26:51.230]  All right, Geoff, you want to call it?
[26:51.350 --> 26:52.070]  You want to count it down?
[26:52.190 --> 26:54.250]  Yeah, well, let's go in 65 seconds.
[26:54.430 --> 26:55.190]  What the fuck?
[26:56.610 --> 26:58.550]  Okay, 65 seconds is like a really long time.
[26:58.630 --> 26:59.070]  That's good, though,
[26:59.070 --> 26:59.990]  because I need to look at my board.
[27:00.250 --> 27:02.210]  We're going to give Andrew a second to come back, too.
[27:02.630 --> 27:03.810]  Oh, there's a sports jersey, though.
[27:04.170 --> 27:04.470]  Damn!
[27:04.810 --> 27:05.550]  You have a puzzle shirt.
[27:05.550 --> 27:05.990]  Fatty pack.
[27:05.990 --> 27:07.010]  Cavalry boots.
[27:07.130 --> 27:08.150]  All right, we're starting to over-focus.
[27:09.530 --> 27:11.470]  On the fence about entering barefoot.
[27:11.570 --> 27:12.330]  Bachelorette party.
[27:12.850 --> 27:13.970]  Dancing on camera.
[27:14.350 --> 27:14.910]  Oh, now I get dog.
[27:15.690 --> 27:17.310]  Ooh, tricycle.
[27:17.330 --> 27:18.490]  Formal attire, fuck.
[27:18.930 --> 27:19.810]  Crosswalk coward.
[27:20.070 --> 27:21.010]  Selfie skateboard.
[27:21.130 --> 27:21.630]  Skateboard's hard.
[27:21.810 --> 27:22.430]  Pink taxi.
[27:24.450 --> 27:25.090]  Suit change.
[27:25.210 --> 27:25.710]  Drunk walk.
[27:25.970 --> 27:26.930]  I forgot about scooter.
[27:26.950 --> 27:27.630]  Dead parrot head.
[27:28.390 --> 27:29.050]  Almost hit my car.
[27:29.250 --> 27:29.970]  This cop!
[27:30.350 --> 27:31.390]  This fucking bastard.
[27:33.790 --> 27:34.030]  Okay.
[27:34.570 --> 27:36.230]  We got 30 seconds till we start.
[27:36.370 --> 27:37.050]  Well, a little less now.
[27:37.290 --> 27:38.150]  We got Andrew back yet?
[27:39.030 --> 27:39.290]  No.
[27:41.110 --> 27:43.490]  Generate a new board, regulationbingo.com.
[27:44.450 --> 27:45.170]  I don't know where he went.
[27:45.410 --> 27:46.910]  Oh, luxury car's gonna be an argument.
[27:47.210 --> 27:47.550]  Damn it.
[27:47.910 --> 27:50.090]  I'm sorry for whatever Eric said.
[27:50.390 --> 27:51.270]  Yeah, me too.
[27:53.010 --> 27:54.330]  It's just because he keeps winning.
[27:54.810 --> 27:55.670]  All right, boys, here we go.
[27:55.970 --> 28:00.170]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[28:00.670 --> 28:01.010]  Bingo!
[28:01.350 --> 28:01.570]  Let's go!
[28:01.710 --> 28:03.690]  Why does the street cop left the fucking scene?
[28:04.430 --> 28:05.710]  Is that a bachelorette party?
[28:06.110 --> 28:08.390]  Uh, it doesn't say.
[28:08.570 --> 28:09.670]  I can see the screen.
[28:09.910 --> 28:10.690]  Is that a FaceTime screen?
[28:10.890 --> 28:11.110]  No.
[28:12.610 --> 28:12.850]  Selfies?
[28:13.170 --> 28:13.270]  Damn.
[28:15.050 --> 28:15.530]  Are that phone?
[28:15.630 --> 28:15.770]  No.
[28:15.930 --> 28:16.470]  There's a cop!
[28:16.590 --> 28:16.970]  Street cop!
[28:17.090 --> 28:17.630]  Scooter gang!
[28:17.830 --> 28:18.390]  Scooter gang!
[28:18.450 --> 28:19.310]  Scooter gang I got.
[28:20.670 --> 28:21.610]  Guy on guy scooter?
[28:21.750 --> 28:22.250]  Street cop.
[28:22.430 --> 28:23.730]  Oh, I'm too deep, baby.
[28:23.770 --> 28:24.310]  Drop something.
[28:24.590 --> 28:25.150]  Scooter gang?
[28:25.350 --> 28:26.370]  There was a guy who dropped something.
[28:26.450 --> 28:26.630]  Really?
[28:26.830 --> 28:27.050]  Yeah.
[28:27.190 --> 28:27.590]  What'd he drop?
[28:27.950 --> 28:29.530]  I think it was his ID or something.
[28:29.670 --> 28:30.830]  He dropped it, picked it up.
[28:30.950 --> 28:31.270]  Damn it.
[28:31.390 --> 28:31.890]  Sucks to suck.
[28:32.090 --> 28:33.450]  I don't have a drop.
[28:33.910 --> 28:35.170]  I've got a lot of foot stuff.
[28:35.230 --> 28:36.850]  Jeans and flip-flops and barefoot.
[28:36.870 --> 28:37.350]  Trade with Nick.
[28:37.970 --> 28:39.230]  No, I don't like feet.
[28:39.370 --> 28:40.270]  I also have barefoot.
[28:41.590 --> 28:42.710]  Hi, acknowledge the camera.
[28:42.930 --> 28:43.910]  Acknowledge the camera.
[28:44.690 --> 28:45.490]  Big wave.
[28:45.790 --> 28:46.030]  You're back!
[28:46.030 --> 28:46.830]  Oh, he's back!
[28:47.090 --> 28:47.750]  Are you okay?
[28:47.950 --> 28:48.570]  Sorry about that.
[28:48.670 --> 28:49.190]  No, no, it's okay.
[28:49.190 --> 28:50.350]  No worries, we're just glad you're okay.
[28:50.550 --> 28:51.590]  We thought Eric offended you.
[28:52.570 --> 28:54.550]  Start a new bingo board.
[28:57.230 --> 28:57.930]  I'm on it.
[28:58.470 --> 28:59.810]  Eric won the last one.
[28:59.970 --> 29:00.090]  Yeah.
[29:00.970 --> 29:01.930]  It's been known to happen.
[29:01.930 --> 29:03.390]  Oh, that's so close to formal wear.
[29:05.090 --> 29:06.010]  Do I have that again?
[29:06.770 --> 29:07.930]  Were they on the fence about entering
[29:07.930 --> 29:09.110]  because they started and then went away?
[29:10.050 --> 29:11.730]  I don't think they hesitated long enough.
[29:11.990 --> 29:12.350]  Yeah.
[29:13.550 --> 29:15.110]  I don't think they were on the fence.
[29:15.250 --> 29:15.890]  I think they just like,
[29:15.930 --> 29:18.510]  I didn't get that impression they were having trouble
[29:18.510 --> 29:19.570]  making up their decision.
[29:20.230 --> 29:21.410]  Oh, is that a jersey?
[29:21.550 --> 29:22.230]  That is a jersey.
[29:22.670 --> 29:23.230]  Yeah, it's a jersey.
[29:23.730 --> 29:24.590]  Do I have that this time?
[29:24.610 --> 29:25.750]  I think it says Okinawa.
[29:26.030 --> 29:26.270]  Yeah.
[29:26.410 --> 29:26.710]  Yeah.
[29:27.050 --> 29:28.150]  Oh, I don't have that anymore.
[29:28.250 --> 29:28.590]  Dang.
[29:28.890 --> 29:29.490]  Yeah, me neither.
[29:30.470 --> 29:30.830]  Dang.
[29:31.930 --> 29:33.610]  Dude, I haven't gotten anything yet.
[29:34.350 --> 29:35.910]  Oh, that's promising for once.
[29:38.250 --> 29:39.670]  What kind of cake are you getting?
[29:39.890 --> 29:40.430]  I don't know.
[29:40.490 --> 29:41.690]  Maybe the same as the last time.
[29:41.850 --> 29:42.250]  None.
[29:42.970 --> 29:43.550]  But we're here.
[29:45.630 --> 29:47.410]  You could door dash the cake.
[29:47.550 --> 29:48.150]  Oh, you could.
[29:48.230 --> 29:48.690]  You should.
[29:48.910 --> 29:49.690]  We have time.
[29:49.850 --> 29:50.310]  We have time.
[29:50.410 --> 29:51.810]  I don't want to door dash the cake.
[29:52.050 --> 29:52.390]  Why not?
[29:52.570 --> 29:53.110]  Door dash the cake.
[29:53.150 --> 29:53.530]  Door dash the cake.
[29:54.150 --> 29:54.550]  Dickheadtruck.
[29:54.770 --> 29:57.290]  Dickheadtruck and Underglow, yeah.
[29:57.870 --> 29:58.590]  Eric, please.
[29:59.230 --> 29:59.890]  That's a double.
[30:01.270 --> 30:02.110]  That's a two for me.
[30:02.130 --> 30:04.550]  Nick wants you to hire a personal taxi for your cake.
[30:05.850 --> 30:07.310]  We could Waymo a cake.
[30:07.850 --> 30:09.950]  If you're going to hire a personal taxi, make sure it's pink.
[30:10.310 --> 30:10.990]  I need that.
[30:16.630 --> 30:18.550]  Dude, I haven't gotten a single thing yet.
[30:19.210 --> 30:19.430]  Whoa!
[30:19.830 --> 30:20.110]  Hoofing it!
[30:20.810 --> 30:21.530]  Hard hoof!
[30:22.250 --> 30:23.070]  Hard hoofing it.
[30:23.170 --> 30:24.730]  Was he trying to fuck with the dude in the truck?
[30:24.830 --> 30:25.410]  Yes, he was.
[30:27.490 --> 30:28.250]  He just, uh...
[30:28.770 --> 30:29.310]  That was weird.
[30:29.310 --> 30:31.830]  Does that count as someone yells to wait up?
[30:32.010 --> 30:32.170]  Yeah.
[30:32.470 --> 30:32.930]  Was it?
[30:33.070 --> 30:33.710]  I don't think so.
[30:35.650 --> 30:36.330]  Just hoofing.
[30:37.370 --> 30:38.130]  Is this drunk walk?
[30:38.250 --> 30:39.030]  I don't have a truck.
[30:39.290 --> 30:39.510]  Yes.
[30:39.810 --> 30:40.150]  Dickheadtruck.
[30:40.250 --> 30:40.550]  Yes.
[30:40.930 --> 30:42.650]  Is that also a dead parrot head, right?
[30:42.750 --> 30:43.230]  I think so.
[30:43.630 --> 30:44.110]  Yeah, definitely.
[30:44.450 --> 30:45.990]  That's a definite dead parrot head.
[30:45.990 --> 30:47.110]  Ooh, I feel good about that.
[30:47.250 --> 30:47.830]  Dead parrot.
[30:48.030 --> 30:49.430]  All of a sudden, we're on the board, boys.
[30:50.410 --> 30:51.190]  Oh, I thought he'd get a dead parrot.
[30:51.190 --> 30:51.890]  Oh God, not again.
[30:52.410 --> 30:53.450]  I thought he had a bandage,
[30:53.510 --> 30:55.050]  but I think his leg was just a bit gammy.
[30:55.470 --> 30:55.810]  Yeah.
[31:00.030 --> 31:01.270]  Oh, is there somebody on a stretcher?
[31:01.850 --> 31:02.330]  There was somebody on a stretcher.
[31:02.350 --> 31:03.750]  There was somebody on a stretcher.
[31:04.130 --> 31:05.410]  I've never seen that before.
[31:05.850 --> 31:06.650]  No, I don't think so.
[31:06.710 --> 31:07.210]  That was just great.
[31:07.270 --> 31:08.430]  There was somebody on the stretcher, Andrew.
[31:08.510 --> 31:09.110]  That was nuts.
[31:09.590 --> 31:10.290]  Acknowledging the camera.
[31:10.330 --> 31:11.070]  I didn't see it.
[31:11.270 --> 31:11.510]  Yeah.
[31:11.590 --> 31:13.910]  Yeah, it was right at the top right of the screen.
[31:14.190 --> 31:15.250]  Oh, that guy's licking his...
[31:15.250 --> 31:15.610]  Oh!
[31:18.770 --> 31:19.870]  Did he put gum on his shoe?
[31:20.270 --> 31:21.910]  I think he's a litter boy.
[31:21.910 --> 31:23.650]  No, he was...
[31:23.650 --> 31:25.290]  He put his cigarette out on his shoe.
[31:25.750 --> 31:26.970]  Now he's gonna go through with it.
[31:28.710 --> 31:32.050]  Is he? Is he gonna throw it away or is he gonna wait and drop it?
[31:32.190 --> 31:32.430]  Dumb hat.
[31:32.430 --> 31:33.430]  Yeah, he dropped it!
[31:33.610 --> 31:33.750]  Dumb hat.
[31:34.190 --> 31:34.830]  Dumb hat.
[31:35.030 --> 31:36.850]  We all saw that.
[31:37.250 --> 31:37.890]  Litter hat.
[31:38.230 --> 31:39.210]  I don't think I have a litter bug.
[31:39.450 --> 31:39.890]  I don't either.
[31:41.390 --> 31:42.230]  We all saw it.
[31:42.310 --> 31:42.790]  I don't have it.
[31:42.830 --> 31:43.310]  Oh, I do have some.
[31:43.330 --> 31:43.830]  I have it.
[31:43.930 --> 31:44.030]  Sweet.
[31:47.930 --> 31:48.430]  Another cop.
[31:48.550 --> 31:49.790]  Great, this fucking cop.
[31:49.970 --> 31:50.670]  Oh, it was the same cop?
[31:50.910 --> 31:51.190]  Yeah.
[31:53.790 --> 31:55.790]  You missed that littering that just happened.
[31:55.790 --> 31:57.210]  About to crack some skulls.
[31:57.230 --> 31:57.430]  Yeah.
[31:59.370 --> 32:00.910]  I need guy on guy scooter.
[32:01.870 --> 32:02.450]  So do I.
[32:02.590 --> 32:03.390]  Yeah, I'm looking for it.
[32:04.530 --> 32:06.610]  Me and Andrew have our eyes peeled for guy on guy scooter.
[32:06.970 --> 32:07.730]  Oh, roller rubbish.
[32:08.390 --> 32:09.390]  Oh, roller rubbish.
[32:09.670 --> 32:10.410]  Oh, I have it.
[32:10.510 --> 32:10.930]  Wow.
[32:12.670 --> 32:13.590]  That's a good one.
[32:13.930 --> 32:15.310]  Is car delivery slash pickup,
[32:15.430 --> 32:17.370]  does the stretcher count for that?
[32:20.090 --> 32:21.230]  I would say, yeah.
[32:21.350 --> 32:22.490]  If it happened on screen.
[32:23.130 --> 32:25.590]  I think it's so rare that I would give it to you.
[32:25.590 --> 32:27.850]  Okay, I'll take it.
[32:29.950 --> 32:32.130]  It's such a, I mean, we've never seen anything like it.
[32:32.130 --> 32:32.630]  Double fisting.
[32:32.930 --> 32:33.910]  Yeah, double fisting.
[32:34.570 --> 32:35.570]  Oh, you had a double fist?
[32:35.730 --> 32:35.850]  Okay.
[32:35.950 --> 32:37.130]  Yeah, good eye, good eye.
[32:37.470 --> 32:38.270]  Don't have it.
[32:39.550 --> 32:40.630]  Need barefoot still.
[32:40.650 --> 32:42.050]  Yeah, I need jeans and flip flops too.
[32:43.410 --> 32:44.210]  Cowboy boots.
[32:52.250 --> 32:55.110]  Someone in chat said, Nick has the mask on in spirit.
[32:56.410 --> 32:57.050]  Extra, ooh.
[32:57.190 --> 32:59.610]  This guy hanging out at the pole at the top.
[32:59.770 --> 33:00.590]  Gonna overstay his welcome.
[33:00.750 --> 33:01.510]  Okay, I was gonna say,
[33:01.590 --> 33:02.810]  he's definitely an overstayer, right?
[33:02.830 --> 33:03.530]  He's working on it.
[33:03.750 --> 33:04.050]  Has he?
[33:04.090 --> 33:05.370]  Yeah, I've got camera overstay,
[33:05.390 --> 33:07.270]  but I feel like he's maybe a minute away from it.
[33:07.270 --> 33:08.510]  Yeah, let's get a little bit longer.
[33:08.610 --> 33:09.110]  I have it as well.
[33:09.250 --> 33:09.930]  Here, we can time it.
[33:09.950 --> 33:10.890]  Let's just start when it works.
[33:11.050 --> 33:12.870]  We notice someone, then we start a minute timer.
[33:13.130 --> 33:15.150]  He's just been there for such a long time.
[33:15.150 --> 33:15.790]  I'll start a timer.
[33:15.990 --> 33:17.370]  Yeah, start a timer for the overstay.
[33:17.370 --> 33:17.890]  All right, ready?
[33:18.150 --> 33:18.290]  Yeah.
[33:20.510 --> 33:20.830]  And...
[33:20.830 --> 33:22.590]  Wow, Nick does not want camera overstayer.
[33:22.590 --> 33:23.690]  Really slow rolling this timer.
[33:23.710 --> 33:24.390]  Yeah, no kidding.
[33:24.390 --> 33:25.470]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[33:25.470 --> 33:26.970]  30 seconds into the fucking...
[33:26.970 --> 33:27.430]  All right, here we go.
[33:27.490 --> 33:28.010]  It's another cop.
[33:28.230 --> 33:28.450]  Yeah.
[33:30.030 --> 33:31.530]  Did you start the timer yet, Nick?
[33:31.610 --> 33:31.970]  I did.
[33:32.150 --> 33:32.450]  Okay.
[33:32.810 --> 33:33.430]  It's a different cop.
[33:34.550 --> 33:34.950]  Fuck.
[33:38.510 --> 33:41.470]  I wonder what all the cop activity is about tonight.
[33:43.450 --> 33:44.270]  Well, it's probably something to do
[33:44.270 --> 33:45.290]  with the person on the stretcher.
[33:45.550 --> 33:46.670]  I definitely think so.
[33:47.130 --> 33:48.370]  You think someone got decked?
[33:48.970 --> 33:49.370]  Maybe.
[33:49.810 --> 33:51.490]  Oh, they had a severe neck injury.
[33:52.550 --> 33:52.950]  From the deck.
[33:52.950 --> 33:54.070]  Maybe slipped on a hot dog.
[33:54.590 --> 33:55.150]  That's what I thought.
[33:56.350 --> 33:57.530]  Plastic hot dog slip.
[33:58.150 --> 33:59.450]  That would cause a smashed hot dog.
[33:59.810 --> 34:00.310]  20 seconds.
[34:00.690 --> 34:01.670]  Oh, a smashed hot dog.
[34:02.470 --> 34:03.630]  I mean, think about it.
[34:03.670 --> 34:04.910]  If Nick would have started that timer on time,
[34:04.950 --> 34:05.470]  we would have had it.
[34:05.730 --> 34:06.710]  Is that an episode?
[34:07.150 --> 34:07.490]  What's that?
[34:08.130 --> 34:09.290]  That we just talked about?
[34:09.590 --> 34:09.810]  Yeah.
[34:10.010 --> 34:10.450]  Not yet.
[34:10.770 --> 34:11.510]  Well, no, it hasn't come out yet.
[34:11.510 --> 34:12.550]  An upcoming episode.
[34:12.810 --> 34:13.130]  Thank you.
[34:15.090 --> 34:15.810]  Nighttime Shades?
[34:17.970 --> 34:18.770]  Are they?
[34:19.330 --> 34:20.910]  No, I just said it wishfully thinking
[34:20.910 --> 34:21.990]  maybe it would show up.
[34:21.990 --> 34:23.050]  No, I get it.
[34:23.190 --> 34:24.190]  You got to conjure those things.
[34:25.130 --> 34:27.550]  Emily looked at the other feed.
[34:27.750 --> 34:28.550]  Ambulance around the corner.
[34:28.770 --> 34:29.330]  Oh, wow, really?
[34:29.610 --> 34:29.630]  Yeah.
[34:30.130 --> 34:30.910]  Oh, crazy.
[34:31.510 --> 34:31.730]  Yeah.
[34:32.790 --> 34:35.050]  That must be what the flashing light is in the reflection.
[34:35.450 --> 34:36.010]  Thank you, beautiful.
[34:36.830 --> 34:37.570]  Thank you, beautiful.
[34:40.370 --> 34:41.630]  Will you tell Eric to get his cake?
[34:41.750 --> 34:42.510]  Sucking on a chili dog!
[34:42.950 --> 34:44.230]  That's sucking on a chili dog.
[34:45.290 --> 34:45.850]  Oh, Eric!
[34:48.490 --> 34:49.890]  He's eating the evidence.
[34:50.250 --> 34:50.470]  Yeah.
[34:52.230 --> 34:52.950]  I got it.
[34:52.950 --> 34:54.270]  I got sucking on a chili dog.
[34:54.590 --> 34:56.330]  That's the first time I've ever seen it.
[34:56.370 --> 34:56.850]  Me too.
[34:57.710 --> 34:59.870]  That scared the fuck out of me.
[35:00.750 --> 35:01.250]  That made me hot.
[35:01.250 --> 35:02.630]  Did I count that as dog out too late?
[35:02.630 --> 35:03.230]  That's a fucking good one, man.
[35:03.650 --> 35:06.730]  No, that is not dog out too late.
[35:08.650 --> 35:09.050]  No.
[35:14.410 --> 35:15.210]  Oh, God.
[35:15.670 --> 35:16.790]  Oh, boy.
[35:16.830 --> 35:18.050]  Andrew, keep an eye at the top
[35:18.050 --> 35:19.790]  and see if there's any guy on guy scooters
[35:19.790 --> 35:20.450]  going on up there.
[35:20.940 --> 35:21.770]  Yeah, I'm looking.
[35:22.070 --> 35:22.850]  Oh, God.
[35:23.010 --> 35:23.790]  Holy shit.
[35:23.810 --> 35:24.930]  It's like a dumb hat, maybe?
[35:25.910 --> 35:27.170]  Two cops, is that a matching outfit?
[35:30.390 --> 35:32.570]  Yeah, it's a uniform, so I think it is.
[35:32.570 --> 35:32.990]  Okay.
[35:33.330 --> 35:34.670]  Yeah, I think it is.
[35:34.830 --> 35:35.750]  What would it be?
[35:35.790 --> 35:36.870]  Okay, matching outfit.
[35:37.110 --> 35:37.650]  Oh, wow.
[35:37.750 --> 35:38.450]  Oh, shit.
[35:38.710 --> 35:40.130]  I guess they technically have to be on the screen
[35:40.130 --> 35:40.570]  at the same time.
[35:40.570 --> 35:41.190]  That's true.
[35:41.490 --> 35:43.130]  I'm gonna undo that until they both show up.
[35:43.290 --> 35:44.150]  Yeah, that's fair.
[35:45.290 --> 35:45.710]  Wow.
[35:46.230 --> 35:48.530]  That dickhead truck, Jesus Christ.
[35:48.530 --> 35:49.230]  That's three.
[35:49.510 --> 35:50.070]  What does that say?
[35:51.210 --> 35:52.970]  Ah, those are just normal people on a scooter.
[35:53.650 --> 35:53.890]  Damn.
[35:54.590 --> 35:55.790]  Just normal scooter folk.
[35:55.890 --> 35:56.070]  Yeah.
[35:56.830 --> 35:57.750]  Oh, living scooter liars.
[35:57.750 --> 35:58.610]  We don't know what that is.
[35:58.670 --> 35:59.330]  That's pretty cool.
[35:59.930 --> 36:00.650]  Hold it closer.
[36:00.790 --> 36:01.270]  Hold it closer.
[36:01.470 --> 36:02.190]  Can't see shit.
[36:02.370 --> 36:03.090]  Oh, Sloppy Joe's.
[36:03.090 --> 36:04.230]  I think it's Sloppy Joe's.
[36:04.510 --> 36:05.150]  Is it for this?
[36:05.230 --> 36:06.250]  No, I think it says...
[36:06.250 --> 36:08.010]  Oh, it's an Ian Faye!
[36:08.150 --> 36:08.550]  Hey, see?
[36:08.890 --> 36:09.250]  Hey!
[36:10.590 --> 36:11.310]  That's awesome!
[36:11.630 --> 36:11.990]  Yeah!
[36:12.530 --> 36:12.890]  Hey!
[36:13.030 --> 36:13.370]  Yeah!
[36:13.730 --> 36:15.570]  Also, the guy didn't overstay his welcome either.
[36:15.690 --> 36:15.810]  Yeah.
[36:16.030 --> 36:16.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:16.510 --> 36:17.610]  It's sort of time-related, anyway.
[36:17.610 --> 36:19.150]  No, it was only 10 seconds late.
[36:19.350 --> 36:21.310]  It was 16 seconds away from hitting.
[36:22.410 --> 36:23.590]  Oh, I have matching outfits, too.
[36:23.710 --> 36:24.570]  Get that cop out here.
[36:25.270 --> 36:27.890]  Do you want to know how the legend shows up on camera?
[36:29.090 --> 36:30.610]  Oh, is that blue thing formal?
[36:30.950 --> 36:31.690]  Oh, that's pretty formal.
[36:31.810 --> 36:32.010]  Where?
[36:32.390 --> 36:32.710]  What?
[36:32.770 --> 36:34.010]  What the hell blue thing are you talking about?
[36:34.010 --> 36:34.250]  Where?
[36:34.270 --> 36:34.790]  Dress or something.
[36:35.690 --> 36:36.730]  It was too...
[36:36.730 --> 36:37.110]  Yeah, no.
[36:37.230 --> 36:37.630]  Dress?
[36:37.630 --> 36:39.110]  Yeah, what about these jean shorts?
[36:39.210 --> 36:39.790]  Are those formal?
[36:39.970 --> 36:40.690]  Get out of here.
[36:42.090 --> 36:43.850]  Are those jean shorts and sandals?
[36:45.090 --> 36:45.910]  Yeah, formal.
[36:45.950 --> 36:46.530]  Do those count?
[36:50.560 --> 36:51.540]  I see the lights.
[36:52.440 --> 36:53.940]  If somebody could almost get hit by a car,
[36:54.020 --> 36:54.880]  I'd appreciate it.
[36:55.020 --> 36:55.580]  I'm with you.
[36:55.760 --> 36:58.120]  What if this guy on the bike falls over right...
[37:00.080 --> 37:00.540]  Damn it.
[37:00.540 --> 37:01.580]  Yeah, feel free to trip.
[37:01.780 --> 37:02.780]  Go, go, go.
[37:03.620 --> 37:03.740]  Oh.
[37:09.360 --> 37:10.740]  Oh, American flag clothes.
[37:10.940 --> 37:11.560]  Have we seen that yet?
[37:11.660 --> 37:13.160]  Oh, we saw a hat a second ago.
[37:13.280 --> 37:13.640]  No, no.
[37:14.640 --> 37:15.160]  Oh, we did?
[37:15.180 --> 37:15.840]  Who's doing an American flag hat?
[37:15.900 --> 37:16.680]  Yeah, two seconds ago.
[37:16.800 --> 37:16.840]  Shit.
[37:16.840 --> 37:17.540]  I didn't see it.
[37:17.800 --> 37:18.320]  What did we see?
[37:18.740 --> 37:19.580]  An American flag hat.
[37:19.700 --> 37:20.580]  Thanks for calling it out.
[37:20.880 --> 37:22.060]  I don't have it, so...
[37:24.720 --> 37:25.860]  So I didn't see shit.
[37:26.700 --> 37:27.840]  I don't think I had it either.
[37:29.560 --> 37:31.480]  Anybody see any high fives or camo?
[37:31.660 --> 37:31.940]  No.
[37:32.280 --> 37:33.000]  I need a fist bump.
[37:34.820 --> 37:35.520]  Oh, I could...
[37:35.520 --> 37:36.460]  And a fanny pack.
[37:37.200 --> 37:37.760]  Fanny pack.
[37:38.260 --> 37:39.160]  That is a fanny pack.
[37:39.400 --> 37:39.540]  Wow.
[37:39.640 --> 37:40.800]  Did you really need a fanny pack?
[37:40.860 --> 37:41.020]  Yeah.
[37:41.380 --> 37:41.860]  Oh, wow.
[37:41.940 --> 37:42.700]  I didn't know that was one.
[37:42.760 --> 37:43.500]  I would have called it out.
[37:44.700 --> 37:45.880]  Oh, is that...
[37:45.880 --> 37:46.440]  No, I didn't.
[37:46.500 --> 37:46.680]  No.
[37:47.500 --> 37:48.260]  Nice try, though.
[37:50.140 --> 37:51.800]  She's on the phone, looking, hey, what's up?
[37:51.800 --> 37:52.040]  Hey, Peter.
[37:52.040 --> 37:52.300]  Jeez.
[37:54.560 --> 37:55.620]  Where's that other cop?
[37:55.700 --> 37:56.160]  Come back.
[37:56.280 --> 37:56.860]  Jesus Christ.
[37:57.180 --> 37:58.500]  The one time I want to fucking see him.
[37:58.880 --> 37:59.120]  Yeah.
[37:59.700 --> 38:01.120]  Oh, this is jeans and...
[38:02.520 --> 38:03.660]  Jeans and flip flops, yeah.
[38:03.940 --> 38:04.320]  Well...
[38:04.320 --> 38:04.920]  It's not flip flops.
[38:05.040 --> 38:06.040]  No, those are sandals.
[38:07.000 --> 38:07.800]  They're strapped.
[38:08.000 --> 38:08.200]  Yeah.
[38:08.540 --> 38:09.280]  They don't flop at all.
[38:09.300 --> 38:10.920]  They got to be the thong, so they don't count.
[38:11.020 --> 38:11.240]  Okay.
[38:11.840 --> 38:12.760]  They don't make the sound.
[38:12.980 --> 38:14.860]  They will flip, flip, flip.
[38:17.040 --> 38:19.000]  I'm not surprised Nick has very strict rules
[38:19.000 --> 38:19.540]  about the footwear.
[38:19.620 --> 38:19.960]  Yeah.
[38:20.360 --> 38:20.760]  Yeah.
[38:20.760 --> 38:22.980]  I know exactly what you're saying, Andrew.
[38:23.380 --> 38:23.400]  No.
[38:23.460 --> 38:24.160]  That's an excellent point.
[38:24.220 --> 38:24.460]  Ambulance.
[38:25.180 --> 38:25.560]  Ambulance.
[38:26.000 --> 38:26.740]  Do I have that?
[38:26.800 --> 38:27.120]  Got it.
[38:27.260 --> 38:29.140]  Call an ambulance, come and pick up the people.
[38:29.340 --> 38:30.120]  Oh, that's loud.
[38:30.400 --> 38:31.240]  Nina, Nina.
[38:32.240 --> 38:32.620]  Warning!
[38:33.560 --> 38:35.380]  Huff, huff, huff, huff, huff.
[38:35.440 --> 38:35.640]  Oof.
[38:37.920 --> 38:39.780]  I could have a fucking bingo,
[38:39.900 --> 38:41.200]  but I need looks like a player.
[38:41.480 --> 38:43.400]  Do you get that girl on your TikTok, Gavin?
[38:44.200 --> 38:44.980]  Do you see her at all?
[38:44.980 --> 38:45.720]  She doesn't have TikTok.
[38:46.120 --> 38:47.080]  I've never seen TikTok.
[38:47.300 --> 38:48.080]  Oh my God.
[38:48.140 --> 38:48.820]  I don't have it either.
[38:50.140 --> 38:52.200]  So what happens when I send you TikToks?
[38:52.220 --> 38:53.320]  Do you just not click on the link?
[38:53.480 --> 38:55.340]  No, what happens is it opens in a browser
[38:55.340 --> 38:57.340]  and a bunch of shit pops up and I say no,
[38:57.500 --> 38:59.500]  and then I have to put the puzzle piece in the thing.
[38:59.800 --> 39:02.540]  And then I have to angle it so I can hit the play button.
[39:03.580 --> 39:04.100]  It seems like a lot.
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.740]  And then you get a download that doesn't play.
[39:06.400 --> 39:07.740]  And sometimes, yeah, it just doesn't play
[39:07.740 --> 39:08.860]  and it would play something completely different.
[39:08.960 --> 39:10.680]  So sometimes you say, what'd you think?
[39:10.700 --> 39:11.700]  And I say, that was great.
[39:12.040 --> 39:13.120]  Yeah, that was funny.
[39:15.860 --> 39:17.780]  A lot of people needing mullets in the chat.
[39:18.820 --> 39:19.220]  Yeah.
[39:19.380 --> 39:20.700]  I haven't seen a lot of mullets.
[39:21.100 --> 39:21.120]  No.
[39:21.360 --> 39:21.800]  Is that MeeMaw?
[39:22.060 --> 39:23.360]  No, I haven't seen a single one.
[39:23.520 --> 39:24.580]  She's moving way too well.
[39:24.740 --> 39:25.020]  Yeah.
[39:26.560 --> 39:27.640]  Too much mobility.
[39:31.480 --> 39:32.600]  Oh, look at these bros.
[39:32.860 --> 39:33.260]  Sunglasses?
[39:33.600 --> 39:34.200]  Come on.
[39:34.660 --> 39:35.500]  Ah, just close.
[39:35.520 --> 39:36.000]  So close.
[39:36.120 --> 39:36.960]  You little shithead.
[39:39.240 --> 39:39.880]  That's matching.
[39:40.040 --> 39:41.420]  That is.
[39:41.760 --> 39:42.760]  Yeah, definitely matching.
[39:43.400 --> 39:44.960]  If I can almost get hit by a car, I got it.
[39:46.720 --> 39:47.520]  Hit him.
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.240]  Is it a bachelorette party?
[39:49.240 --> 39:50.320]  No, it's probably not.
[39:50.640 --> 39:51.280]  I don't think so.
[39:54.260 --> 39:55.180]  Wishful thinking.
[39:55.640 --> 39:56.840]  Man, that scooter looks...
[39:56.840 --> 39:57.480]  Is that a luxury car?
[39:57.520 --> 39:57.780]  Shit.
[39:58.460 --> 39:59.720]  It fucking costs like one.
[40:01.340 --> 40:02.000]  Is that...
[40:02.000 --> 40:02.800]  What, the Bronco?
[40:03.200 --> 40:03.480]  Yeah.
[40:04.060 --> 40:04.980]  Stupid expensive.
[40:05.500 --> 40:08.160]  They cape in completely.
[40:08.480 --> 40:08.780]  Yeah.
[40:09.760 --> 40:11.280]  Oh, two dudes in the back of a pickup?
[40:11.460 --> 40:12.100]  Not a safe car.
[40:12.320 --> 40:12.600]  Sweet.
[40:17.350 --> 40:18.270]  No barefoot.
[40:20.470 --> 40:21.450]  No barefoot.
[40:21.450 --> 40:22.050]  No barefoot.
[40:22.710 --> 40:23.070]  Trike!
[40:23.470 --> 40:24.010]  That's a good one.
[40:24.070 --> 40:25.290]  That's a tricycle, I need that.
[40:25.970 --> 40:26.370]  Got it.
[40:27.470 --> 40:31.010]  Oh, that's the second appearance of this jersey shirt guy.
[40:31.250 --> 40:31.490]  Mm-hmm.
[40:33.110 --> 40:34.210]  That's the third time he's walked by.
[40:34.210 --> 40:34.410]  Sports jersey.
[40:34.530 --> 40:35.610]  No, that is the third time.
[40:35.650 --> 40:35.990]  Oh, it is?
[40:35.990 --> 40:36.510]  That's the third time, yeah.
[40:36.810 --> 40:37.050]  Damn.
[40:37.690 --> 40:38.650]  I don't even have that one anymore.
[40:38.670 --> 40:39.130]  I do.
[40:40.590 --> 40:41.770]  If you win again...
[40:41.770 --> 40:43.410]  I need cowboy boots and carrying an instrument,
[40:43.570 --> 40:44.390]  so don't worry about me.
[40:44.530 --> 40:44.810]  Okay.
[40:44.990 --> 40:46.710]  If you win again, will you door dash the cape?
[40:47.250 --> 40:47.610]  No.
[40:47.930 --> 40:48.270]  Mm-hmm.
[40:48.790 --> 40:49.670]  Why are you so against capes?
[40:49.670 --> 40:51.810]  He doesn't want us to have the cake.
[40:52.130 --> 40:52.570]  Why not?
[40:52.690 --> 40:53.750]  He's keeping it for him.
[40:53.870 --> 40:54.390]  Eat the cake myself.
[40:54.610 --> 40:55.810]  He's not gonna do it anyway.
[40:55.930 --> 40:56.710]  He just doesn't share.
[40:57.510 --> 40:58.770]  I just love eating my own cake.
[40:58.930 --> 41:00.470]  I love having my cake and eating it too.
[41:00.650 --> 41:01.670]  Is that Kesha?
[41:05.610 --> 41:09.270]  I don't think so.
[41:09.410 --> 41:10.350]  Oh, open shirt.
[41:10.630 --> 41:11.170]  We should do that.
[41:11.170 --> 41:11.890]  Whoa, that guy's awesome.
[41:11.890 --> 41:12.670]  Sunglasses at night.
[41:12.830 --> 41:13.510]  Sunglasses at night.
[41:13.670 --> 41:14.130]  There we go.
[41:15.050 --> 41:16.430]  Nighttime shades, all right.
[41:16.690 --> 41:17.670]  Almost get back our high five.
[41:17.750 --> 41:18.310]  Give me a high five.
[41:18.810 --> 41:19.710]  You guys high five.
[41:20.010 --> 41:21.130]  Double fisting right there.
[41:21.250 --> 41:22.610]  Some fist bump, let's have some in.
[41:23.130 --> 41:23.590]  Fist bump.
[41:23.990 --> 41:24.990]  Shake hands, hug.
[41:25.210 --> 41:26.030]  Almost a fist bump.
[41:33.320 --> 41:34.320]  Something's gonna happen here.
[41:34.520 --> 41:35.220]  Do something.
[41:35.540 --> 41:37.960]  Somebody shake a hand.
[41:38.020 --> 41:38.480]  High five.
[41:39.400 --> 41:40.080]  Give me a high five.
[41:40.200 --> 41:41.000]  Fist a bump.
[41:42.340 --> 41:43.640]  Oh, I can see that guy's FaceTime screen.
[41:44.060 --> 41:45.060]  Up there, if anybody needs that.
[41:45.100 --> 41:45.380]  Where?
[41:45.980 --> 41:46.440]  Is he Face...
[41:46.440 --> 41:47.460]  Is that FaceTime on your shirt?
[41:47.480 --> 41:48.080]  Is that a FaceTime screen?
[41:48.200 --> 41:48.460]  Dog!
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.300]  I think he's just holding up a camera.
[41:50.300 --> 41:51.520]  Oh, there is a dog.
[41:52.680 --> 41:53.280]  Oh, dog!
[41:53.280 --> 41:53.360]  Oh, dog!
[41:53.820 --> 41:55.020]  Yeah, I think he was just holding up a camera.
[41:55.160 --> 41:56.560]  I thought he was talking to somebody who was doing it.
[41:57.140 --> 41:57.380]  Hey.
[41:57.520 --> 41:57.960]  I guess not.
[41:58.020 --> 41:59.020]  The dog has multiple legs.
[41:59.080 --> 41:59.920]  Can those be paw-paws?
[42:02.640 --> 42:03.360]  Jesus Christ.
[42:03.360 --> 42:03.940]  Dickhead truck.
[42:05.220 --> 42:06.760]  Is anyone camera shy?
[42:07.360 --> 42:07.700]  Whoa!
[42:07.760 --> 42:08.480]  Oh, that'd be nice.
[42:08.600 --> 42:09.800]  Those are some ultimate dickhead trucks.
[42:09.880 --> 42:10.640]  Holy shit.
[42:11.120 --> 42:11.480]  Rims.
[42:11.840 --> 42:12.700]  It's the dickhead brigade.
[42:13.500 --> 42:13.860]  Whoa.
[42:13.860 --> 42:14.200]  Oh.
[42:17.120 --> 42:20.340]  Well, that's a big, beefy dude right there.
[42:22.740 --> 42:23.560]  Holy shit.
[42:23.560 --> 42:24.520]  This looks like it's a pickup.
[42:24.920 --> 42:25.000]  Yeah.
[42:26.340 --> 42:27.220]  Maybe not.
[42:27.460 --> 42:27.820]  Get in.
[42:28.020 --> 42:28.800]  Oh, is this wrong car?
[42:28.900 --> 42:30.000]  This might be wrong car.
[42:30.240 --> 42:30.440]  Oh.
[42:31.060 --> 42:31.480]  Wrong car.
[42:31.600 --> 42:32.300]  Wrong car.
[42:32.740 --> 42:33.560]  Wrong car.
[42:35.720 --> 42:36.360]  Damn it.
[42:40.740 --> 42:41.400]  Lot of good ones.
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.800]  He has an offensive t-shirts?
[42:43.240 --> 42:43.700]  No.
[42:43.700 --> 42:43.820]  Come on.
[42:45.800 --> 42:46.800]  Almost get hit by a car.
[42:47.060 --> 42:47.880]  Almost get hit by a car.
[42:47.960 --> 42:49.100]  A little bit of sheen on that head there.
[42:49.220 --> 42:49.560]  Oh, yeah.
[42:49.700 --> 42:49.860]  Yeah.
[42:50.700 --> 42:51.100]  Give it.
[42:51.200 --> 42:51.860]  I'll give it to you.
[42:52.300 --> 42:54.120]  Didn't we start with some sheen earlier?
[42:54.380 --> 42:54.620]  Almost.
[42:54.940 --> 42:55.360]  Paw-paw.
[42:55.520 --> 42:55.960]  Paw-paw.
[42:56.200 --> 42:56.820]  Paw-paw.
[42:57.160 --> 42:57.700]  Paw-paw.
[42:58.060 --> 42:59.620]  I just need a yawn.
[42:59.700 --> 43:00.300]  Somebody yawn.
[43:02.840 --> 43:03.640]  You, yawn.
[43:05.100 --> 43:06.020]  What does that shirt say?
[43:06.520 --> 43:07.060]  Is that offensive?
[43:07.560 --> 43:08.600]  Something about limes.
[43:09.240 --> 43:10.040]  The disease?
[43:11.280 --> 43:12.660]  I'm offended by limes disease.
[43:13.900 --> 43:14.700]  Limes disease.
[43:15.600 --> 43:16.180]  Oh, hoofing it.
[43:16.680 --> 43:16.980]  Hoofing it.
[43:17.920 --> 43:18.320]  Yawn.
[43:19.920 --> 43:21.000]  Put the limes in the coconut.
[43:21.460 --> 43:22.780]  So, wait, is it not wrong car?
[43:23.220 --> 43:24.180]  I think that's a different car.
[43:24.460 --> 43:24.860]  Is it?
[43:25.780 --> 43:26.960]  I think it just looks like it.
[43:28.600 --> 43:29.960]  I think we had a whole light cycle.
[43:32.040 --> 43:33.060]  Oh, look at them boots.
[43:33.960 --> 43:35.420]  Got cowboy or the, oh no.
[43:35.580 --> 43:36.460]  Combat boots.
[43:36.620 --> 43:37.360]  Combat boots.
[43:37.520 --> 43:38.680]  I need cowboy boots.
[43:39.700 --> 43:40.900]  What, there's that new boot goop?
[43:41.280 --> 43:43.000]  I need somebody to almost get hit by a car.
[43:43.960 --> 43:44.980]  That's what I need.
[43:47.940 --> 43:49.160]  Is that a luxury car?
[43:50.300 --> 43:50.520]  Where?
[43:50.900 --> 43:51.360]  I don't know.
[43:52.100 --> 43:52.840]  The Kia?
[43:53.140 --> 43:56.800]  That car has, if a car drives by multiple times,
[43:56.860 --> 43:58.160]  does that count as a person?
[43:58.320 --> 43:58.920]  I don't think so.
[44:00.320 --> 44:01.660]  I'm going all in on-
[44:01.660 --> 44:02.300]  Sweet stash.
[44:02.680 --> 44:03.820]  Almost get hit by a car.
[44:04.100 --> 44:05.040]  Oh, that's a sweet stash.
[44:05.080 --> 44:05.960]  That's a sweet stash right there.
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.660]  Oh, sweet stash, bro.
[44:07.800 --> 44:08.360]  Great stash.
[44:14.830 --> 44:16.390]  I still need cowboy boots.
[44:16.930 --> 44:17.290]  Yeah.
[44:20.730 --> 44:21.450]  That close.
[44:24.950 --> 44:26.350]  Oh shit, it's 1115.
[44:26.470 --> 44:27.130]  Oh, it's slop o'clock.
[44:27.410 --> 44:28.230]  Oh, it is slop o'clock.
[44:28.850 --> 44:29.170]  When did that happen?
[44:29.170 --> 44:30.950]  Now the games begin, boys.
[44:31.230 --> 44:32.770]  We're in the eye of the storm, it looks like.
[44:33.270 --> 44:34.270]  It's too calm.
[44:40.230 --> 44:41.710]  We're really locked in now, right?
[44:41.750 --> 44:42.310]  Yeah, we are.
[44:44.530 --> 44:45.070]  Double fist.
[44:45.070 --> 44:45.710]  God damn it.
[44:46.810 --> 44:48.650]  Anyone wearing some jeans or flip flops?
[44:48.650 --> 44:49.890]  Somebody lunged out into the street.
[44:50.650 --> 44:53.050]  She has jeans, but I can't tell what her footwear is.
[44:53.270 --> 44:53.410]  Yeah.
[44:53.530 --> 44:54.070]  That's hard to see.
[44:54.950 --> 44:55.830]  Keep an eye on her.
[44:56.250 --> 44:56.990]  Oh, no.
[44:57.130 --> 44:57.370]  No.
[44:57.970 --> 44:59.710]  They're sandals, not flip flops.
[45:00.710 --> 45:01.010]  Damn.
[45:01.350 --> 45:01.810]  Sorry, Gavin.
[45:02.050 --> 45:02.390]  That's good.
[45:03.170 --> 45:04.190]  That's a big old dude there.
[45:05.430 --> 45:07.230]  You guys wouldn't say he looked like Gavin,
[45:07.410 --> 45:08.110]  would you, in a few years?
[45:09.130 --> 45:09.810]  He's swank.
[45:11.470 --> 45:12.910]  Really need to find one of us.
[45:16.540 --> 45:19.280]  There's a bandage, a bandage, it's a boot lady again.
[45:19.520 --> 45:20.520]  Different boot lady, actually.
[45:21.220 --> 45:22.380]  Oh, that guy's saying, uh-uh.
[45:22.500 --> 45:23.360]  Is this bouncer bouncing?
[45:23.660 --> 45:24.620]  That bounce is bouncing.
[45:24.720 --> 45:25.700]  This bouncer's bouncing.
[45:26.180 --> 45:27.260]  He's saying piss off.
[45:28.560 --> 45:28.620]  Wow.
[45:28.660 --> 45:30.220]  That's it, they're bouncing, look.
[45:30.560 --> 45:31.720]  Oh, bouncer's bouncing.
[45:31.940 --> 45:33.000]  I never see that.
[45:33.040 --> 45:33.980]  I got it.
[45:34.080 --> 45:34.200]  Wow.
[45:34.320 --> 45:35.140]  That's awesome.
[45:35.740 --> 45:36.020]  Wow.
[45:36.020 --> 45:36.980]  And don't come back.
[45:37.080 --> 45:37.400]  Yeah.
[45:37.840 --> 45:39.260]  There's, what's...
[45:39.260 --> 45:40.020]  Oh, is that LeBoot?
[45:40.180 --> 45:40.780]  No, it's not good.
[45:41.140 --> 45:41.880]  No, it's close, though.
[45:41.880 --> 45:43.660]  Dude, bouncer bouncing is awesome.
[45:44.160 --> 45:44.260]  Dude.
[45:44.860 --> 45:46.240]  It's like puking in a trash can.
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.600]  When it happens, it's like Christmas.
[45:48.360 --> 45:50.420]  But only in this instance.
[45:51.120 --> 45:52.140]  When we puke, it's terrible.
[45:52.480 --> 45:53.240]  Oh, yeah, obviously.
[45:54.480 --> 45:54.920]  Bachelorette.
[45:55.320 --> 45:55.620]  Oh, bachelorette.
[45:55.900 --> 45:56.280]  Bingo.
[45:57.140 --> 45:57.880]  You serious?
[45:58.520 --> 45:59.380]  All right, you gotta order the cake.
[45:59.380 --> 46:01.500]  Dumb hat, bachelorette party, free space,
[46:01.620 --> 46:02.860]  bouncer bouncing, matching outfits.
[46:03.760 --> 46:03.880]  Ah.
[46:04.700 --> 46:06.120]  Got some rocks, you underage losers.
[46:07.520 --> 46:09.140]  Congratulations to Eric again.
[46:09.160 --> 46:10.740]  That's bullshit, every time.
[46:10.940 --> 46:11.060]  This sucks.
[46:11.740 --> 46:12.600]  Get the cake.
[46:13.100 --> 46:14.160]  Let the audience see a seat.
[46:14.160 --> 46:15.920]  The audience wants to see us next, baby.
[46:19.800 --> 46:21.820]  We're gonna turn part two of this into a mukbang.
[46:22.240 --> 46:23.540]  Do you guys wanna go on the same board
[46:23.540 --> 46:25.060]  and see who can black out or go further?
[46:25.180 --> 46:26.500]  You wanna go on a new board?
[46:26.840 --> 46:27.120]  Yeah.
[46:27.740 --> 46:28.840]  I said two things.
[46:29.100 --> 46:30.620]  I said two fucking things.
[46:30.760 --> 46:31.080]  Just keep going.
[46:31.160 --> 46:31.800]  I said two.
[46:32.240 --> 46:33.100]  Okay, thank you.
[46:33.140 --> 46:34.060]  Thank you, Andrew.
[46:34.280 --> 46:34.820]  Thank you, Andrew.
[46:34.960 --> 46:35.080]  Formal attire.
[46:35.780 --> 46:37.160]  I'm sorry, I'm thinking about cake
[46:37.160 --> 46:39.080]  and how you refused to order it.
[46:39.120 --> 46:40.320]  I'm sitting here quietly.
[46:40.520 --> 46:41.240]  You know what, Andrew?
[46:41.300 --> 46:42.000]  I'll give that.
[46:43.040 --> 46:43.660]  Formal attire?
[46:44.260 --> 46:45.300]  That's formal attire?
[46:45.560 --> 46:47.180]  I think with the shoes and the shirt
[46:47.180 --> 46:50.500]  and the dress and the sparkle, she could be...
[46:50.500 --> 46:50.920]  I disagree.
[46:52.020 --> 46:52.820]  That's wild.
[46:53.000 --> 46:54.120]  I think that she would be,
[46:54.180 --> 46:56.100]  if she was at a gala, that would look appropriate.
[46:56.380 --> 46:56.980]  I don't think so.
[46:57.000 --> 46:57.600]  Have we seen the front?
[46:58.240 --> 46:58.480]  No.
[46:58.840 --> 46:59.320]  Oh, less.
[47:01.580 --> 47:02.220]  Turn around.
[47:04.300 --> 47:06.760]  I feel like it could be worn with a pearl necklace.
[47:07.080 --> 47:07.240]  No.
[47:08.740 --> 47:10.480]  I'm really teasing that turn.
[47:10.700 --> 47:12.360]  Is she wearing an even microphone?
[47:12.600 --> 47:13.200]  I don't even know.
[47:13.200 --> 47:14.160]  Hold on, hold on.
[47:14.180 --> 47:14.540]  There it is.
[47:16.300 --> 47:17.020]  That's not...
[47:17.020 --> 47:18.280]  Nevermind, Emily says not formal.
[47:20.400 --> 47:20.760]  Nevermind.
[47:20.880 --> 47:22.040]  What's Emily's thoughts on cake?
[47:23.120 --> 47:24.840]  Yeah, she said that...
[47:24.840 --> 47:25.340]  What about that?
[47:25.540 --> 47:26.480]  Is that formal?
[47:26.540 --> 47:26.860]  We deserve cake.
[47:27.140 --> 47:27.620]  Which one?
[47:27.660 --> 47:27.920]  No.
[47:27.960 --> 47:28.920]  That wedding dress thing?
[47:29.180 --> 47:29.540]  No.
[47:30.460 --> 47:31.600]  She probably said, she said,
[47:31.740 --> 47:32.720]  add three cakes for everybody.
[47:33.600 --> 47:34.860]  But Eric, he just gets one.
[47:35.880 --> 47:37.080]  I get two, I got two bingos.
[47:37.220 --> 47:37.960]  Eric, order the cake.
[47:38.140 --> 47:39.220]  Yeah, go ahead guys, order the cake.
[47:39.620 --> 47:40.280]  You have the card.
[47:40.560 --> 47:41.480]  Yeah, I mean, you guys won.
[47:41.720 --> 47:42.040]  Go ahead.
[47:42.520 --> 47:43.260]  You won.
[47:43.560 --> 47:44.140]  Oh, that's right.
[47:44.360 --> 47:45.480]  So pick your favorite.
[47:45.480 --> 47:45.960]  Oh, they're hugging.
[47:46.860 --> 47:48.260]  Oh, that's a big hug.
[47:48.980 --> 47:50.880]  That truck is too big.
[47:51.040 --> 47:52.160]  That's crazy.
[47:52.520 --> 47:53.600]  He's back again.
[47:53.720 --> 47:54.440]  He is back again.
[47:59.530 --> 47:59.970]  What?
[48:00.090 --> 48:01.090]  Why do you pull up like that?
[48:01.230 --> 48:01.550]  Oh.
[48:02.610 --> 48:03.890]  Someone getting into that thing?
[48:04.170 --> 48:05.310]  Yeah, somebody is getting into that.
[48:09.830 --> 48:10.850]  Andrew, what do you need?
[48:12.770 --> 48:13.610]  Formal attire.
[48:14.770 --> 48:17.290]  Oh, no wonder you're pushing for it.
[48:18.110 --> 48:18.730]  I still need that.
[48:18.750 --> 48:20.910]  I feel like the wedding dress thing should be formal.
[48:21.410 --> 48:23.130]  I definitely not.
[48:23.330 --> 48:24.730]  It's probably the closest we've been.
[48:24.810 --> 48:28.530]  Isn't a formal attire like an outfit for a fancy event?
[48:28.730 --> 48:29.770]  What's more fancy than a wedding?
[48:31.450 --> 48:33.410]  I just don't think the wedding dress itself,
[48:33.750 --> 48:35.170]  outside of the wedding, is formal.
[48:35.650 --> 48:36.530]  There's that jersey.
[48:36.810 --> 48:38.790]  Is black tie formal or is that too far?
[48:39.070 --> 48:39.690]  Black tie is formal.
[48:39.790 --> 48:40.230]  Yeah, that's formal.
[48:42.330 --> 48:43.110]  Somebody yawn.
[48:43.110 --> 48:45.790]  I like Nick's like, is definition of formal, formal?
[48:45.870 --> 48:46.610]  Yeah, no shit.
[48:46.730 --> 48:47.650]  American flag shirt.
[48:48.290 --> 48:49.070]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[48:49.270 --> 48:49.590]  What?
[48:49.790 --> 48:50.430]  Is that a fish?
[48:50.570 --> 48:51.310]  That's a Texas flag.
[48:51.590 --> 48:52.230]  That's the same thing.
[48:52.650 --> 48:53.210]  Does that count?
[48:54.450 --> 48:54.850]  All right.
[48:55.470 --> 48:55.870]  No, it doesn't.
[48:55.870 --> 48:57.090]  It definitely does not count.
[48:57.510 --> 48:58.210]  Sunglasses at night?
[48:58.230 --> 48:58.590]  Let me try that.
[48:58.830 --> 48:59.410]  Another jersey.
[48:59.730 --> 49:01.050]  Oh, that's definitely a jersey, yeah.
[49:02.470 --> 49:03.590]  Ew, I wonder who's...
[49:03.590 --> 49:05.350]  I wonder who that is.
[49:05.690 --> 49:06.790]  American flag shorts!
[49:07.310 --> 49:07.810]  There you go.
[49:08.110 --> 49:08.550]  Did you see that?
[49:08.910 --> 49:10.390]  No, but I'll take your word for it.
[49:10.390 --> 49:11.210]  I'll take your word for it.
[49:11.690 --> 49:12.750]  I think, right?
[49:12.750 --> 49:12.830]  Right?
[49:14.430 --> 49:15.910]  Are we going for blackout?
[49:16.410 --> 49:17.190]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:17.210 --> 49:17.930]  Just go, yeah.
[49:18.670 --> 49:19.130]  Head sheen.
[49:20.790 --> 49:21.810]  Have we seen camo?
[49:22.590 --> 49:23.670]  No, but I would like to.
[49:23.770 --> 49:24.650]  Is that jeans and shorts?
[49:24.910 --> 49:25.790]  Or jeans and flip flops?
[49:25.990 --> 49:26.170]  No.
[49:26.290 --> 49:27.650]  No, those are like pants.
[49:27.790 --> 49:28.070]  Yeah.
[49:35.780 --> 49:37.020]  What about those?
[49:37.380 --> 49:38.940]  Fuck, those are shorts.
[49:41.160 --> 49:42.360]  Jeans shorts don't count?
[49:43.080 --> 49:43.520]  No.
[49:43.960 --> 49:44.280]  No.
[49:45.440 --> 49:46.760]  There's a spirit to this.
[49:46.920 --> 49:47.300]  Oh, God.
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.140]  I'd argue the spirit is the jean part.
[49:53.220 --> 49:54.240]  Jeans and spirit.
[49:58.330 --> 49:59.270]  Where are you from?
[49:59.330 --> 49:59.710]  I heard.
[49:59.910 --> 50:02.510]  I do feel like jean shorts could be its own category, though,
[50:02.550 --> 50:03.670]  because how often do you see that?
[50:03.930 --> 50:04.950]  Who has a mattress and a pickup?
[50:08.470 --> 50:10.850]  Ooh, we should do one that's moving out in any time.
[50:10.950 --> 50:12.890]  Ah, moving out's a good one, Nick.
[50:13.210 --> 50:14.810]  Salty stick, thank you for the subs.
[50:14.810 --> 50:16.030]  Oh, shit, yeah, thank you.
[50:18.670 --> 50:19.410]  Thank you so much.
[50:19.910 --> 50:20.530]  Thank you.
[50:21.930 --> 50:24.130]  What kind of cake I'm gonna get later?
[50:24.630 --> 50:25.290]  What do you mean, later?
[50:25.410 --> 50:25.750]  What do you mean?
[50:26.410 --> 50:27.670]  Just for myself, I have a cake.
[50:27.790 --> 50:30.470]  Just so you can gloat it over us, and we can eat it, too.
[50:30.790 --> 50:31.930]  If you have a cake later,
[50:31.990 --> 50:33.510]  what you're gonna do is waste half a cake.
[50:33.790 --> 50:34.670]  Yeah, you don't wanna waste a cake.
[50:34.670 --> 50:35.590]  Yeah, you should, yeah, throw it away.
[50:35.590 --> 50:36.210]  In this economy?
[50:36.390 --> 50:37.810]  Just have some of it and throw it away.
[50:38.210 --> 50:38.810]  Oh, they're back.
[50:39.050 --> 50:41.650]  Oh, thumbs up, yeah, we're good, yeah, we're good.
[50:42.050 --> 50:44.210]  Yeah, we're good, okay, yeah, okay.
[50:45.550 --> 50:48.310]  Is this, wait, did they get that cop to help them?
[50:50.890 --> 50:52.270]  Yeah, they had a man on the inside.
[50:53.230 --> 50:53.770]  Fuck it.
[50:54.830 --> 50:56.470]  There's a lot happening all of a sudden.
[50:56.550 --> 50:57.810]  Wasn't that a Denzel Washington movie?
[50:57.850 --> 50:59.030]  There's so many things to try to attract.
[50:59.270 --> 51:00.050]  They got a man on the inside.
[51:00.050 --> 51:00.370]  Samsung!
[51:01.350 --> 51:02.430]  My favorite player.
[51:03.930 --> 51:04.690]  North Face.
[51:07.790 --> 51:09.130]  Somebody, somebody's shoe fell off.
[51:11.310 --> 51:13.990]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[51:14.650 --> 51:15.270]  Come on.
[51:15.610 --> 51:16.450]  They getting in a fight?
[51:17.130 --> 51:17.530]  No.
[51:18.910 --> 51:19.230]  Oh.
[51:19.370 --> 51:20.030]  Oh, maybe.
[51:20.050 --> 51:20.830]  It's a little heated.
[51:21.910 --> 51:22.270]  Oh.
[51:22.290 --> 51:22.550]  Maybe.
[51:24.210 --> 51:25.250]  Oh, come on now.
[51:25.430 --> 51:25.810]  Oh.
[51:26.490 --> 51:27.490]  This got interesting.
[51:27.670 --> 51:28.430]  Bitch, okay.
[51:28.930 --> 51:29.330]  They fighting?
[51:30.230 --> 51:30.950]  Or are they just talking?
[51:30.970 --> 51:31.750]  I think it's just...
[51:31.750 --> 51:32.630]  I think they're just talking.
[51:32.930 --> 51:33.390]  I think they're talking.
[51:33.970 --> 51:35.770]  Oh, she's getting in her face, though.
[51:36.790 --> 51:37.710]  They're going the same direction.
[51:38.050 --> 51:38.330]  What?
[51:39.590 --> 51:40.630]  It seems as though...
[51:40.630 --> 51:41.070]  They can't be...
[51:41.070 --> 51:41.550]  I think they're just talking.
[51:41.630 --> 51:42.810]  Nah, they're just chatting.
[51:42.810 --> 51:43.570]  I think they're just talking.
[51:43.570 --> 51:43.810]  I think they're just chatting.
[51:44.130 --> 51:44.230]  Yeah.
[51:45.430 --> 51:47.010]  I think you're nice.
[51:47.450 --> 51:47.810]  Ah.
[51:49.830 --> 51:50.870]  I was with you, Geoff.
[51:53.670 --> 51:54.390]  Camo hat.
[51:55.790 --> 51:56.870]  Yeah, where?
[51:57.110 --> 51:58.110]  The guy who just went in the bar.
[51:59.550 --> 52:00.650]  All right, I'll trust you.
[52:01.550 --> 52:02.490]  I needed it.
[52:02.610 --> 52:02.990]  Thank you.
[52:10.180 --> 52:11.100]  We're locked in.
[52:12.420 --> 52:14.320]  So much was happening and then everyone went away.
[52:14.480 --> 52:14.760]  Yeah.
[52:14.760 --> 52:17.980]  It's the Evan Flo of the sloppy Joe, man.
[52:19.940 --> 52:21.880]  Hey, there's two cops right there.
[52:22.040 --> 52:22.560]  Matching outfits.
[52:22.660 --> 52:23.140]  Matching outfits.
[52:25.140 --> 52:25.720]  Puffin' it.
[52:26.980 --> 52:27.360]  Pizza.
[52:27.860 --> 52:28.680]  Is that a pizza?
[52:29.140 --> 52:29.860]  Yeah, baby.
[52:30.360 --> 52:31.720]  We've seen all the food tonight.
[52:31.960 --> 52:33.360]  We didn't have pizza when we were there, did we?
[52:34.480 --> 52:36.760]  Yeah, we had pizza at that fuckin' restaurant
[52:36.760 --> 52:37.940]  that Bernie Dog found.
[52:38.340 --> 52:40.200]  Remember, that was the night where we pleaded the second
[52:40.200 --> 52:40.540]  for the first time.
[52:40.560 --> 52:43.040]  Yeah, I thought I'd plead the Shrek again.
[52:43.040 --> 52:45.540]  When Bernie fuckin' ran everybody to the White House.
[52:45.560 --> 52:46.660]  Oh my God, it's a dickhead truck rally.
[52:46.900 --> 52:49.360]  Is that a tire in the back?
[52:49.460 --> 52:50.200]  Yeah, it sure is.
[52:50.220 --> 52:52.280]  That might've been our first dickhead truck convoy.
[52:52.400 --> 52:52.700]  Wow.
[52:55.140 --> 52:58.740]  We got a dickhead convoy truckin' through the night.
[52:59.220 --> 53:00.240]  What does that one say?
[53:01.560 --> 53:02.560]  Ah, Steph Curry.
[53:02.880 --> 53:04.380]  These guys get hooked on number 30.
[53:05.680 --> 53:07.220]  Yeah, that's American flag shorts for sure.
[53:11.630 --> 53:13.190]  Two tires in the back.
[53:13.450 --> 53:13.630]  Wow.
[53:13.630 --> 53:14.050]  Three!
[53:14.250 --> 53:15.090]  There's three tires.
[53:15.830 --> 53:16.750]  Ah, ah, ah.
[53:21.090 --> 53:24.010]  Ah, ah, ah.
[53:24.010 --> 53:24.290]  Ah, ah, ah.
[53:24.410 --> 53:25.390]  Ah, ah, ah.
[53:25.710 --> 53:27.230]  Ah, ah, ah.
[53:27.290 --> 53:27.870]  Oh wow.
[53:28.070 --> 53:30.230]  Oh my God, that was crazy.
[53:30.690 --> 53:31.790]  They legit almost got hit.
[53:32.030 --> 53:33.050]  I'll give it to you.
[53:33.270 --> 53:34.030]  I'll take that one.
[53:34.090 --> 53:34.990]  That's a bingo for me,
[53:35.050 --> 53:36.110]  but we're just clearing the board out.
[53:36.210 --> 53:36.410]  Yep.
[53:37.430 --> 53:38.290]  That was crazy.
[53:38.410 --> 53:39.710]  They went down the center.
[53:39.710 --> 53:41.230]  That car was like, fuck you.
[53:41.250 --> 53:41.950]  Yeah, no shit.
[53:41.950 --> 53:43.430]  I mean, I totally get it.
[53:43.490 --> 53:44.190]  Right there with them, yeah.
[53:44.830 --> 53:46.870]  Also, these are like the smallest,
[53:47.130 --> 53:48.710]  these are like small streets.
[53:49.650 --> 53:51.970]  Like when you're there, there's not a lot of streets.
[53:54.830 --> 53:55.990]  Someone be camera shy.
[53:57.010 --> 53:57.710]  Oh, that'd be nice.
[54:02.680 --> 54:04.080]  Candy vape machine.
[54:06.120 --> 54:07.260]  That's matching outfits.
[54:07.560 --> 54:08.340]  Nick's new hit single.
[54:08.520 --> 54:08.940]  That's it.
[54:09.680 --> 54:10.320]  Is that Pol Pol?
[54:10.540 --> 54:12.300]  Nah, but we already got one earlier.
[54:12.520 --> 54:13.180]  He's walking too.
[54:13.220 --> 54:14.360]  He ain't fucking close though.
[54:15.060 --> 54:16.500]  He's the coming one in front of us.
[54:16.660 --> 54:17.220]  Five years.
[54:19.500 --> 54:20.320]  Two years.
[54:20.540 --> 54:21.060]  Yeah, I think two.
[54:21.440 --> 54:22.360]  I think he's almost there, bud.
[54:24.480 --> 54:25.920]  In Florida, maybe, yeah.
[54:27.020 --> 54:27.400]  Spade.
[54:27.720 --> 54:27.880]  Oh!
[54:29.840 --> 54:31.100]  That's a spill drop.
[54:32.560 --> 54:33.380]  Oh, spill.
[54:34.320 --> 54:34.700]  Mm-hmm.
[54:35.100 --> 54:35.980]  That lady's lactating.
[54:36.960 --> 54:37.280]  What?
[54:37.460 --> 54:37.640]  What?
[54:38.080 --> 54:38.340]  Uh-oh.
[54:39.440 --> 54:39.960]  Oh.
[54:40.280 --> 54:40.560]  Damn.
[54:40.920 --> 54:41.380]  No.
[54:42.200 --> 54:43.200]  It's on camera, lady.
[54:43.620 --> 54:45.180]  I don't have that one.
[54:45.940 --> 54:47.120]  Chug, chug, chug.
[54:47.120 --> 54:47.620]  Chug, chug.
[54:47.900 --> 54:48.480]  Chug, chug, chug.
[54:50.680 --> 54:51.040]  Oh!
[54:51.320 --> 54:51.680]  Hey!
[54:51.940 --> 54:52.740]  Oh, no, freeze!
[54:52.780 --> 54:53.480]  Hey, where's the cake?
[54:56.340 --> 54:57.960]  We're gonna pause till Eric orders.
[54:58.140 --> 55:01.000]  Yeah, we'll hold this thing hostage till Eric orders cake.
[55:02.840 --> 55:04.240]  Man, if I won bingo earlier,
[55:04.320 --> 55:05.580]  I would have already ordered the cake.
[55:05.900 --> 55:08.300]  You can order the cake right now if you want to.
[55:08.380 --> 55:08.840]  I didn't win.
[55:09.960 --> 55:10.500]  Well, there you have it.
[55:13.200 --> 55:13.460]  Sorry.
[55:14.660 --> 55:15.800]  Nick really is a foot guy.
[55:16.040 --> 55:17.600]  No, I tapped you in the knee!
[55:17.740 --> 55:19.260]  That's the first thing he said when he came in,
[55:19.340 --> 55:20.540]  that is, can I take my shoes off?
[55:21.160 --> 55:23.160]  No, Eric started the shoe-off train.
[55:24.140 --> 55:25.180]  Why is it a train?
[55:25.700 --> 55:26.800]  Because we fall in suit.
[55:27.120 --> 55:28.540]  Nick likes to run a shoe train.
[55:30.120 --> 55:31.660]  You want to try mine on?
[55:32.920 --> 55:34.140]  You try mine, I'll try yours.
[55:36.820 --> 55:37.740]  I'm a size 12.
[55:39.060 --> 55:40.660]  We've got tall fellas tonight.
[55:42.320 --> 55:42.680]  Chug.
[55:43.200 --> 55:44.300]  You side-eyed me.
[55:45.280 --> 55:46.400]  Like a dog.
[55:50.940 --> 55:51.820]  No mullets.
[55:52.440 --> 55:54.140]  No, it's not a good mullet night.
[55:54.180 --> 55:54.880]  That's close.
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.700]  It's close, but I think he's just long-haired.
[55:56.880 --> 55:57.000]  Yeah.
[55:59.280 --> 56:00.780]  I haven't seen cowboy boots.
[56:00.800 --> 56:02.440]  That is what maybe, if we were going to do awards,
[56:02.520 --> 56:04.100]  I would say worst shorts of the night.
[56:04.220 --> 56:06.840]  Yeah, especially paired with those shitty sandals.
[56:07.600 --> 56:08.360]  Goddamn, dude.
[56:08.660 --> 56:09.280]  Get it together.
[56:10.280 --> 56:11.980]  Maybe we incorporate awards.
[56:17.700 --> 56:19.860]  All right, I'm going to give the Dodgers hat award
[56:19.860 --> 56:21.060]  to this guy in the bottom left.
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.380]  Maybe if we save enough clips,
[56:23.460 --> 56:25.700]  we could have, like, mullet of the year award at the end.
[56:25.800 --> 56:26.060]  Wow.
[56:27.120 --> 56:27.520]  TPG.
[56:28.040 --> 56:29.780]  Oh, that guy's huffing it up front.
[56:33.060 --> 56:34.620]  All of these people have shoes on.
[56:35.680 --> 56:37.060]  There's a lot of shoes tonight.
[56:37.260 --> 56:38.480]  Yeah, Nick is pissed.
[56:38.620 --> 56:38.820]  Yeah.
[56:39.620 --> 56:40.340]  I don't like feet.
[56:42.360 --> 56:43.600]  I don't like feet.
[56:43.720 --> 56:44.520]  I love feet.
[56:45.380 --> 56:45.780]  No.
[56:48.900 --> 56:50.300]  Come on, Nick, say part two.
[56:50.980 --> 56:51.600]  Wait, what?
[56:54.100 --> 56:54.500]  Christ.
[56:54.880 --> 56:56.380]  Oh, we should do socks and sandals.
[56:56.460 --> 56:56.920]  Is that a one?
[56:57.480 --> 56:59.040]  We can definitely add that.
[56:59.140 --> 56:59.980]  We can definitely add that.
[57:00.100 --> 57:01.300]  Oh, that's a great one.
[57:01.600 --> 57:01.780]  Yeah.
[57:04.680 --> 57:06.920]  Oh, she just got yoinked in.
[57:13.880 --> 57:14.680]  Are those?
[57:14.880 --> 57:15.240]  No.
[57:15.780 --> 57:17.160]  Those are just ugly-ass shoes.
[57:20.160 --> 57:22.560]  That's the highest up fanny pack I've ever seen.
[57:23.340 --> 57:24.060]  Oh, wow.
[57:24.780 --> 57:26.020]  It's like a shoulder pack.
[57:26.180 --> 57:26.580]  Big time.
[57:28.760 --> 57:31.220]  Maybe he's got a condition and it's got, like, his heart monitor in it.
[57:35.230 --> 57:36.270]  He loves too much.
[57:39.710 --> 57:43.570]  You guys remember that movie Untamed Heart with Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei?
[57:43.730 --> 57:43.970]  No.
[57:43.970 --> 57:45.390]  Where they worked at a restaurant together?
[57:45.670 --> 57:45.790]  No.
[57:45.790 --> 57:48.910]  And then she went home one night and some guys tried to jump her and he saved her.
[57:48.990 --> 57:51.730]  But then he found out that he had a monkey heart and he was dying.
[57:51.730 --> 57:52.190]  What?
[57:52.830 --> 57:53.570]  They fell in love.
[57:53.630 --> 57:53.890]  What?
[57:54.430 --> 57:54.910]  What?
[57:55.750 --> 57:57.210]  That's why it's called Untamed Heart.
[57:58.310 --> 58:00.090]  How did he get a monkey heart?
[58:00.110 --> 58:01.490]  Like a heart transplant.
[58:01.850 --> 58:02.650]  They used a monkey.
[58:02.810 --> 58:04.010]  It was like an experimental thing.
[58:04.070 --> 58:07.510]  And he was slowly dying because monkey hearts don't work forever, I guess.
[58:07.530 --> 58:07.690]  Why?
[58:07.810 --> 58:08.930]  Just get another monkey heart.
[58:08.930 --> 58:10.410]  Yeah, just keep swapping in hearts.
[58:10.730 --> 58:11.630]  It's just monkeys.
[58:11.670 --> 58:13.430]  At least that's how I remember the movie.
[58:14.190 --> 58:17.010]  If it's just monkeys, that's fine.
[58:21.430 --> 58:24.530]  That might be the greatest review of a movie I've ever heard.
[58:24.950 --> 58:25.270]  Woah!
[58:25.590 --> 58:25.610]  Woah!
[58:27.490 --> 58:27.810]  Overtake!
[58:28.010 --> 58:28.530]  Puffin' it!
[58:30.690 --> 58:32.190]  Andrew, would you get a monkey heart?
[58:32.410 --> 58:33.450]  Would you get a monkey heart, Andrew?
[58:34.690 --> 58:36.970]  Oh, now he's drunk walking up there on the phone.
[58:37.410 --> 58:38.110]  She almost fell over.
[58:38.170 --> 58:39.750]  And then she walked right into the fuckin' pole.
[58:40.030 --> 58:41.130]  Now she's yelling at the pole.
[58:42.150 --> 58:45.470]  I don't think she's actually yelling at it, but she did turn around and look at it like it was its fault.
[58:45.490 --> 58:46.170]  How dare you?
[58:46.290 --> 58:46.910]  Yeah, look at her.
[58:48.890 --> 58:49.690]  Crossmark cavern.
[58:52.750 --> 58:55.130]  I got my monkey heart on ice. I'm ready to go.
[58:57.870 --> 58:59.490]  Keep it freezed.
[58:59.550 --> 59:03.550]  Yeah, I got six or seven monkey hearts. When they give out, I just swap in a new monkey heart.
[59:04.370 --> 59:07.370]  I don't know what blood types or whatever any of these are.
[59:07.810 --> 59:10.870]  I just got a bunch of monkeys.
[59:11.430 --> 59:13.170]  Do you need to match the blood type of a heart?
[59:14.450 --> 59:15.950]  I bet it doesn't hurt.
[59:15.950 --> 59:18.750]  You don't have blood put in with it, do you?
[59:19.790 --> 59:20.670]  You think it's just empty?
[59:20.990 --> 59:22.030]  I think you get empty heart.
[59:23.410 --> 59:24.610]  Yeah, you provide the blood.
[59:24.670 --> 59:25.470]  No starter blood?
[59:27.550 --> 59:27.990]  Shit.
[59:28.930 --> 59:29.890]  How do they drain it?
[59:30.250 --> 59:30.890]  Tip upside down.
[59:30.890 --> 59:33.830]  Now, if you want a heart with no blood, that's about 500.
[59:42.310 --> 59:43.190]  Oh, shit.
[59:45.230 --> 59:46.990]  Oh, Christ. What is going on?
[59:47.030 --> 59:48.450]  It's gotta be a bachelorette party.
[59:48.690 --> 59:49.410]  Yeah, I think so.
[59:49.470 --> 59:51.730]  But I didn't see any wedding apparel, so...
[59:52.830 --> 59:54.050]  Could just be a good time.
[59:57.150 --> 59:59.550]  Look at this guy. He's tall as shit.
[01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.750]  Tall man.
[01:00:04.350 --> 01:00:06.630]  I wonder if there's like a tall guy convention there this weekend.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:12.480]  Stache.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:14.560]  Tall.
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.100]  Trip.
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.940]  We miss beach goths, apparently.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.620]  Oh, do we? Shit.
[01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.430]  If somebody could cry...
[01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:34.230]  I haven't gone in so long, my screen was locked.
[01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:40.270]  Just gotta... seven ketchup bottles there.
[01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.350]  Oh, there's some dancing over there.
[01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:48.570]  Dancing.
[01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:50.630]  Dancing, dancing!
[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.850]  That's a machine.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.020]  Sunglasses? Nope. Nerd glasses.
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:00.980]  Yeah, definitely nerd.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:06.640]  You know, we've seen a couple cars zip around other cars. What if we called it life in the fast lane?
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.060]  I like that.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.680]  I like that too.
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:09.440]  That's a good idea.
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.440]  Life in the wrong lane?
[01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.950]  She's lost.
[01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:19.950]  She alright.
[01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.230]  I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that there.
[01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.990]  That was awesome.
[01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:27.130]  That was cartoonish.
[01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.090]  This isn't my hotel.
[01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.630]  I feel like you don't see fights anymore.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.430]  And I don't mean fistfights, I mean even couple fights, you know? Arguments.
[01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.710]  I don't think I've ever seen one every time we've done this.
[01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.170]  Maybe everyone's really happy.
[01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:43.330]  Whoa, that is some serious ass head shooting.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.820]  Oh, and there's some more.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.160]  That guy's kind of a bezos.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.780]  Whoa, what happened?
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.420]  We time jumped.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.340]  How far behind were we?
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:01.500]  I don't know, that was crazy.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.160]  Did we go back?
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:05.060]  It says 11.26.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.420]  We jumped back in time.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:11.320]  Did you lean on the time machine, Nick?
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.320]  Switch, nevermind.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:14.900]  Switch what?
[01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.360]  The camera.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:17.720]  Where?
[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.220]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:25.560]  I have to shrink this first, chill out.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:26.700]  What was that?
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:28.360]  Was she laughing?
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:29.640]  Or was she throwing up?
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.820]  Well, this is the past, so it doesn't count.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:33.860]  This was like 8 minutes ago.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.340]  We already saw it, we're just watching it over again.
[01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:45.370]  Alright, that is weird.
[01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:50.150]  Still a good level?
[01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.650]  Yep.
[01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:53.610]  I'm just going to assume these people are overstaying their welcome.
[01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.890]  Awesome.
[01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:01.650]  Alright, who's closest to filling up their board?
[01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:04.370]  Not me.
[01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.050]  So far.
[01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.370]  I need like 11 still.
[01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.250]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.510]  Hand-drawn, thank you very much for the subs.
[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.050]  Hand-drawn, underscore.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.840]  So many shoes on.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.080]  More people headed to the tall convention.
[01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:29.910]  Beach goth.
[01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:33.530]  I think that was just a woman in a black shirt.
[01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.510]  Yeah, I think she just dressed up.
[01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:35.390]  That was just Bachelorette.
[01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:38.910]  If you give him beach goth for that, but not for...
[01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:41.110]  We're not.
[01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:44.530]  People in the chat are saying barefoot. I didn't see barefoot.
[01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:45.590]  Oh, what, where?
[01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.570]  I didn't see it.
[01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:47.810]  It's crazy.
[01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.090]  That's a shame.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:54.640]  Shit.
[01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.980]  I've been looking all night.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.760]  Troutdamager, thank you for the subs.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.300]  Troutdamager.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:06.820]  Yeah.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.580]  Oh, Christ.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.040]  What does your shirt say?
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:12.820]  Dude, socks and sandals again, Nick. That's a good addition.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.460]  Yeah, it is.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:14.360]  Yeah, it is a good one.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.320]  Dude, Mark the Frog is here? Oh, shit.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:19.880]  Oh, shit.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.500]  Oh, hoofing it.
[01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.100]  Hoofing it.
[01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.740]  Give me the phone.
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:27.720]  Give me the phone.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.240]  Oh, the flergie, but I also saw someone that was like rectum something.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.880]  Damn near killed him.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.400]  Oh, was it like spectrum rectum or something?
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.220]  I'm not sure.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.040]  Rectum something.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:41.940]  Braxamon.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:42.500]  Thank you.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.220]  She's hoofing it.
[01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:46.840]  Thanks for all these gifted subs.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:47.740]  Yeah, appreciate you guys.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.060]  Thank you so much.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.120]  Will this be a VOD? Yes.
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:51.640]  Yes.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.200]  Yes, it will.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:55.700]  Sunglasses at night up there.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:57.180]  I think we already have them though.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:04:59.580]  Any wheelchairs?
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:00.880]  Not yet.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:01.360]  None.
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.480]  It's been a non-wheelchair, non-pink taxi night.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.120]  Oh, yeah, not a pink taxi.
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:06.500]  Rectum spectrum.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.680]  Full rectum wart.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.980]  Dude, that one is close to me.
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.460]  Crosswalk tower?
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.100]  Yeah.
[01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:13.800]  Yeah.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:16.960]  He stumbled.
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.200]  He kind of stumbled.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:23.240]  He stumbled because he second-guessed himself.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.220]  Have we seen a luxury car?
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:25.860]  Yeah.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.520]  Not in this round.
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.180]  Not that we've counted anyway.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.100]  I have it as well.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.780]  Mark the front.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.360]  Single gifted sub got ass-blasted by rectum spectrum.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.120]  Ah.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:44.900]  Oh, shove.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.420]  Oh, shove.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.680]  I think they're playful.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.600]  Still a shove.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.460]  It is a shove though.
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.960]  Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Nickens.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:52.720]  What?
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:53.340]  What?
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.880]  A big cup of shove.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.220]  These are pretty good names.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.540]  Thank you so much.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.840]  I hope I can get you a warm cup of shut the hell up.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.660]  I wonder if he'll be in 2.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.940]  Ben Stiller in Happy Gilmore 2.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.020]  He was in Herbie Halloween.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.200]  Dude, rectum spectrum with 5 more.
[01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:17.300]  That's the same character.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.220]  Was he really?
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:18.560]  Yeah.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.160]  He reprised that character.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.740]  I couldn't finish that film.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:22.920]  I didn't watch it either.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.360]  Sweet stash.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.100]  Is there like an event they're going on or are they IDing them?
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.120]  Dog's not too late.
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:30.640]  It's an ID.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:31.900]  Yeah, here's a dog.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.820]  There's a dead...
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:33.460]  The bird!
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.120]  Shit!
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.180]  Wow!
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:38.860]  Is that an all-timer?
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.580]  That was an all-timer.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.560]  Cockatoo or 3.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.440]  That was crazy.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.540]  Oh, cross my coward.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:44.940]  Coward.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.800]  Big time.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.900]  That's like textbook.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.080]  I don't have cockatoo.
[01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:52.580]  What about 3?
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:54.760]  Nope.
[01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:55.960]  Dancing.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:56.700]  Dancing.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.240]  I don't think I've ever seen them ID anyone.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.420]  They've been IDing everyone all night.
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.940]  I saw one night a dude took a lady's ID and threw it in the fucking street.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.820]  That's awesome!
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:09.100]  I think I took a video of it.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:10.800]  I might have sent it to you guys years ago.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:11.360]  Was it fake?
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:13.660]  Oh, shitload of stuff.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.320]  Kid's not too late.
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.200]  Psycho dragon.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:16.320]  Psycho dragon and...
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.680]  Thank you so much, Psycho.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:18.720]  Thank you, Psycho dragon.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.120]  Oh, elbow deep daddy, thank you.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:22.960]  What?
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.480]  Andrew, what was that name one more time?
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.240]  Oh, that would be elbow deep daddy.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.680]  Swank Sinatra.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.860]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.020]  I'd just love to know...
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.600]  I'd love to see the day that elbow deep daddy's mom sees that campaign.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:54.300]  Oh, JD Fritzl gifted a sub to shitting and farting.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.560]  I dodged the camera wave.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.360]  The way it works...
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.380]  Rectum spectrum.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:03.860]  Let's, uh...
[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.060]  More rectum spectrum.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.220]  Dancing at the top.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:13.800]  Do we start the overstay timer?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:14.380]  Ready?
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.980]  I think these guys just died here.
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:17.380]  Alright.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:19.720]  Osmo's more dismissal thinking.
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.200]  Oh.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:23.700]  Stay put, big fella.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.660]  Sammy Sosa's steroid acne.
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:34.280]  Five different socks.
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:38.300]  I think they're just trying to get our attention now.
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:42.320]  Oh, man.
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.140]  Sammy Sosa's steroid acne.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.640]  Jose Canseco's steroid balls.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.840]  That's a stupid hat.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.420]  Hoofing it?
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.060]  Which one?
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.000]  Socks and sandals again.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.640]  Yeah, socks and sandals again.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.760]  The beanie at Key West.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.040]  Oh, okay.
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.220]  Bad dancing.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.380]  That's some strutting.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.920]  Is that a mullet?
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.220]  I think he just has a shitty haircut.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.720]  Oh, it's the sunglasses.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.240]  Cowboy boots!
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.420]  Schindler's Fist!
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:20.600]  Cowboy boots.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:20.980]  Schindler's Fist.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:22.960]  Schindler's Fist is always getting subs.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.840]  So we got cowboy boots for many reasons.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.740]  Cowboy boots.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.420]  Schindler's Fist must be a top contributor.
[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:29.080]  Gotta be.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:29.800]  Absolutely.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:31.420]  100%.
[01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:35.320]  Is that formal?
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:40.820]  Triple BT has gifted a sub to Dane Cook Gaming.
[01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:43.520]  The Dane Cook?
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.780]  Gavin Schnozgoz has given a sub.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.620]  And Cranium Overload.
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.560]  This is great.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.140]  Thank you so much.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.400]  If you've got a weird name, make sure you sub.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.820]  More cowboy boots.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.480]  Theatr gifted about 10?
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:08.020]  Yep.
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.280]  Oh, I got gifted a sub!
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:12.080]  Wow!
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:13.900]  By JD Fritzy.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:14.160]  Wow!
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.100]  I appreciate that.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.080]  What are you gonna do with it?
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.820]  Probably watch our streams.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:20.680]  You're on our streams.
[01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.760]  Well, when I'm looking at chat.
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:24.100]  You're in our streams.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.960]  When I'm looking at chat while we're streaming.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.380]  Holding hands.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.580]  Chat is saying, are these beach goths?
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:31.980]  No.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.660]  I don't think so either.
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.480]  I think they had a dress code where the bride-to-be gets to wear white.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.340]  And all the bridesmaids have to wear all black.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.100]  Are you a god?
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.200]  Five gifted.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:46.980]  Thank you.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.180]  We should have a prompt.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.480]  There's an American flag.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.180]  There's an American flag.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:50.900]  Oh, hell yeah.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.220]  Annie's helping.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.220]  He skipped away.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.100]  You have a sweet stache.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:56.380]  Maybe we should have a prompt for, I know your pin code.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.180]  It's right there.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.540]  Oh, wow.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.520]  Should we put the timer on these two?
[01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.540]  Yeah, put it on.
[01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:07.440]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.720]  One minute.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.520]  Are they checking out the stream?
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.380]  I hope they're checking out the stream.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.760]  Oh, no way.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:15.900]  We're on the internet?
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.020]  We'll wait until 10 seconds.
[01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:19.460]  Whoa.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.440]  Man, that's some bright...
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.100]  Underglow.
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.040]  Kid out too late again.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:23.700]  Kid out too late.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:24.400]  Huffing it.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:25.180]  Huffing it.
[01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:25.620]  Yes.
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:27.680]  Huffing it again.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.920]  Oh, huffs all over.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.560]  Double huff.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.000]  Oh, wow.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.660]  Sneaky walk away.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:36.980]  What's that hat?
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:38.960]  It's a P.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.620]  I think he's waiting for the other alphabet hats to show up.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.420]  He's got a whole crew.
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.160]  There's T right there.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.700]  We have 15 seconds.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:53.940]  He's back.
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.740]  Annie left.
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:56.400]  Yeah, but the other guy stayed.
[01:11:57.020 --> 01:11:58.700]  Yeah, but the other guy wasn't as annoying.
[01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:01.220]  I need it too.
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:04.580]  Well, we got five seconds, so what's the call?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.260]  And one. Zero.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.460]  I think it counts.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.380]  I think it counts.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.940]  Camera over stare.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.000]  Alright, skateboard time.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:15.640]  Need skateboard.
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.740]  Need jeans and flip flops.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.100]  Yeah, that'd be nice, jeans and flip flops.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.120]  Need barefoot, which apparently I missed.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.580]  Need barefoot.
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.500]  Need luxury car.
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.300]  Crying.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.120]  Yeah, man, good luck.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.740]  Need yawning.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.220]  Need carrying an instrument.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.600]  I just don't see it happening.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.020]  Such a rare one.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.600]  Huffing it.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.620]  Huffing it.
[01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.550]  Well, it got wild all of a sudden.
[01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:52.210]  Four more.
[01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:54.750]  I'm tired.
[01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:57.230]  These fucking guys again.
[01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:59.690]  Oh, no, this is a different outfit. Sorry.
[01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:01.930]  I thought that was one of the matching guys from last time.
[01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.510]  Alright, these dickheads definitely overstaying their...
[01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:07.230]  Hey!
[01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.290]  That's that regulation guy, right?
[01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.550]  I don't know.
[01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:11.470]  I think so.
[01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:18.010]  Dancing.
[01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:19.210]  Dancing.
[01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:20.070]  Cops.
[01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:21.450]  Oh, yeah, cops.
[01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:35.360]  Hey, Gavin?
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:35.880]  Yeah?
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:36.640]  Tell us a joke.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.140]  Ha!
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.460]  Tricycle.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.440]  That was a good one.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.220]  I've heard that one before.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.480]  Inadvertent horn.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.740]  Thanks for the five good subs.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:52.920]  Oh, thank you.
[01:13:57.290 --> 01:14:00.770]  I'm down to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
[01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.210]  I can't believe there are no mullets.
[01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:02.490]  There are skateboards.
[01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:03.970]  That's close.
[01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.030]  Yeah, skateboard, I feel like...
[01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.710]  Is that close?
[01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:07.490]  Eh, maybe not.
[01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:09.610]  What's he got there?
[01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:12.370]  Ah, yeah, what is that?
[01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:13.610]  Is he stealing something?
[01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.090]  It's like tucked under his shirt.
[01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:18.410]  They won't need this painting.
[01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:19.870]  That's probably his colostomy bag.
[01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:22.850]  Other baked goods, thank you for the subs.
[01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:25.070]  Where does the colostomy bag go in?
[01:14:26.150 --> 01:14:27.810]  What's your opinion on caked baked goods?
[01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:28.010]  The body?
[01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:31.410]  Yeah, I think it just goes into a hole they cut into you.
[01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.010]  Just like in the gut hole?
[01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:33.590]  I think so.
[01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:36.630]  Colon.
[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:39.610]  It's kind of like a CPAP for your poop.
[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:40.770]  CPAP?
[01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:46.390]  Piles, I have no idea how hard that is.
[01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.230]  Pile drive your siblings 88.
[01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:49.450]  Five gifted, thank you.
[01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.910]  Thank you.
[01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:51.590]  Thank you so much.
[01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:55.050]  Man, those are some tall socks with shorts.
[01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.270]  What was that interaction?
[01:14:57.150 --> 01:14:57.370]  Whoa!
[01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:59.010]  Life in the fast lane.
[01:14:59.250 --> 01:14:59.830]  Yeah, it is.
[01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:01.030]  Another one?
[01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:02.130]  That dude lit up.
[01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:04.930]  It's not every day you see somebody smoke a cigarette in 2025.
[01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.990]  Yeah.
[01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:11.410]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:14.450]  Feet and cigarettes, he'll never have...
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.660]  Another chili dog?
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.020]  Camo, camo.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.320]  Was that chili dog?
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:29.240]  I couldn't tell.
[01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:30.440]  I couldn't see it.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:32.520]  It was chewing with its mouth open.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.080]  Ghost baker, five gifted, thank you.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.780]  Thank you.
[01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.510]  Oh, the pea man is back.
[01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:50.450]  The letter pea man.
[01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:56.530]  You think pea man is the...
[01:15:56.530 --> 01:15:57.190]  Sweaty little evening.
[01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:58.270]  Oh, is that a luxury car?
[01:15:59.690 --> 01:16:00.130]  Yeah.
[01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.850]  Yeah, sure.
[01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:01.570]  Convertible Merc?
[01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:01.870]  Yeah.
[01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:10.270]  Admiral chops.
[01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:12.010]  Thanks for the five gifted subs.
[01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:13.310]  No offensive t-shirts.
[01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.910]  Thank you.
[01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:15.570]  I feel like those used to be so common.
[01:16:18.270 --> 01:16:19.930]  Can't say anything nowadays.
[01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.190]  We got one in the last round, but yeah.
[01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.810]  Not since.
[01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:24.050]  Pour it out.
[01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:29.470]  Nothing offensive about sloppy joes.
[01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.950]  Police.
[01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.010]  Socks and sandals.
[01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:42.690]  Champion has done such an impressive turnaround as a company.
[01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.910]  When I was growing up, that was like the lamest clothes you could wear.
[01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:46.350]  Yeah.
[01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:47.510]  Here we go.
[01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.710]  Drunk and pulling on each other.
[01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:51.690]  SCL Rev, 20 gifted.
[01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:52.410]  Whoa, that's a lot of money.
[01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:53.230]  Thank you.
[01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:55.110]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:56.410]  Thank you.
[01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:58.270]  I love you.
[01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:02.490]  This guy was...
[01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.810]  Oh, you fucking...
[01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:06.290]  Fuck you, litterbug.
[01:17:06.430 --> 01:17:06.870]  Do I have that?
[01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:09.650]  That was like 80% of a cigarette.
[01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.110]  A lit fucking cigarette, you asshole.
[01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:12.810]  And you don't have your elbow tattooed.
[01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:16.070]  You got everything around the elbow tattooed, but not the elbow.
[01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:17.470]  Embarrassing for you.
[01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:18.290]  Yeah, I'm really embarrassed.
[01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:20.030]  You'd feel guilty as shit if that car exploded.
[01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:20.930]  I mean, I fucking get it.
[01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.650]  It hurts, but...
[01:17:22.650 --> 01:17:23.210]  Tough guy.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:27.620]  Oh, fist bump!
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.140]  Fist bump!
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:30.880]  What is that?
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.620]  I did it.
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.420]  Do we see a high five at any point?
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.280]  I haven't.
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.840]  Oh, I'm just so fucked.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:39.320]  I know.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:42.980]  Oh, you are too.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.160]  Look at how much you have left.
[01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.020]  You know, you turned...
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.540]  That's seven left.
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:48.760]  I wonder if we can do...
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.940]  I wonder if we see that enough.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.000]  I don't know the last time I spanked you.
[01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.500]  That tricycle just did one.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.700]  Right, I don't know the time before that.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:58.720]  Like, the last time I saw it.
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:00.820]  I don't ever think about looking for it, you know?
[01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:05.060]  She's got her sunglasses on, right?
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:06.860]  First time chat.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:07.660]  What is this?
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.000]  Well, we're playing bingo.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.020]  Yeah, I guess we assume...
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.240]  We've been playing this for a couple of years now, so we assume everybody knows.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:21.280]  But from time to time, we here at Regulation will get together and we'll play a game we like to call Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.340]  Where we will watch this live stream outside of the Sloppy Joe's bar and restaurant in Key West, Florida.
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.640]  One of our favorite places and a place that we all went to together.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.140]  And we will play a version of bingo that we have created.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:35.920]  And the winner gets a free cake.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.820]  And it's always been Eric.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.520]  But he won't god damn order it.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.420]  That is a fucking meemaw up there.
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:42.920]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.520]  Go to regulationbingo.com if you want to play along.
[01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:49.320]  Yeah, you can generate your own free bingo board.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.640]  Yeah, you might beat us by the time...
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.260]  I would scissorhands...
[01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:03.230]  I think they're just making accounts today.
[01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.910]  What is that shirt? Is that an offensive shirt?
[01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:09.150]  Is it like a baby with sunglasses?
[01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:12.410]  Yeah, yeah, it's super offensive.
[01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:14.990]  Babies need sunlight. That's bad.
[01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:18.030]  Babies need sunlight.
[01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:20.990]  I'm offended.
[01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.990]  Reverse vampires.
[01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.750]  They have two reflections.
[01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:29.110]  Oh, shit.
[01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:33.650]  Oh, I bet this is offensive.
[01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.130]  Eating pussy.
[01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.910]  Yeah.
[01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:39.510]  Eating pussy, what?
[01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:40.690]  It doesn't matter.
[01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:44.430]  Eating pussy cures something in COVID.
[01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:46.130]  Cures erectile dysfunction.
[01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:57.380]  Gavin, are you still looking forward to this?
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:58.780]  Still am.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.080]  I'm with you.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.200]  There's no bears on Key West.
[01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.160]  Hang on.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.800]  She's laying down the law.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.060]  She's like, that is not how this weekend is going to go.
[01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.780]  We are here to support Melanie.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.520]  This needs to be a prompt.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:14.500]  Yeah.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.760]  Speakerphone for all?
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:19.820]  Talking like it's 2012?
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:20.420]  Yeah.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.380]  I mean, you could just say speakerphone, right?
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:26.400]  Probably.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.480]  It's almost like old-time telephone.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:31.540]  The one that you would hold right here and talk into.
[01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.740]  Jeez, he's squirting someone's ass.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:34.640]  Oh!
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.780]  They're not happy with that guy.
[01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:46.090]  Nobody's fallen tonight.
[01:20:46.290 --> 01:20:47.050]  Not yet.
[01:20:47.290 --> 01:20:49.430]  Good balance on this Friday night.
[01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:53.670]  Oh, he's happy.
[01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:55.690]  Maybe two old backwards cats.
[01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.330]  He's a Penn State fan.
[01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.370]  What does he have to be happy about?
[01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:02.870]  They were in the playoff this year.
[01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:05.450]  That's a dead parrot head up there.
[01:21:06.310 --> 01:21:07.330]  Sports jersey, too.
[01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.870]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:11.330]  Which one's the dead parrot?
[01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:13.230]  The guy that looks like he's going to fall forward.
[01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:17.570]  The shirtless guy, bobbing and weaving.
[01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:19.710]  He was bobbing and weaving.
[01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:22.430]  Could be flea as well, if he needs something to look like.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.500]  No jeans and flip-flops yet.
[01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.560]  We didn't see new boot goofing, did we?
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.460]  Uh, yeah.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.300]  Oh, we did?
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:37.860]  Yeah, we did.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.800]  The girls in all black.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:42.000]  Right.
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:45.860]  Oh, that's jean shorts and flip-flops.
[01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:46.300]  Yeah, that's close.
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:46.800]  Close.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.540]  Damn close.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:50.640]  That's a long...
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.180]  Oh, it's a truck.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.820]  They don't look like they're fun at all.
[01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:57.280]  Mm-mm.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.700]  What if we had a prompt that was nobody?
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:01.920]  Just like, empty street?
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.880]  If you can't see a single human,
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.180]  Yeah, I like that prompt.
[01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:05.900]  That's a pretty good one.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:06.980]  That's fun.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.380]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.700]  For the dead moment to be perfect.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.640]  You should be screaming for the lost guy.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:15.360]  Move!
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.460]  Get out of the frame!
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:17.100]  Oh, get out!
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:18.120]  Get out way too late.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:18.580]  Oh.
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:19.800]  Get out!
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.220]  It's fucking midnight in there.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.220]  What are you, are you insane?
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.780]  The kid might be sleeping in the stroller.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:30.140]  That's a poor substitution for a bed.
[01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.780]  Well, okay.
[01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:33.000]  Ghost town.
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:36.340]  Nick, there is nothing for a kid out there at midnight.
[01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:40.200]  Parents have a good time.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.680]  A kid needs parents who are happy.
[01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.280]  What is this guy doing?
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:52.220]  Which one?
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.840]  The guy that's madly gesturing across the street.
[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.160]  It's just all about his arms.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.540]  Oh, is that Chili Dog?
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.160]  I think so.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:02.800]  Oh, yeah.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.180]  It looks like it.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:04.600]  It did.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:06.600]  Absolutely did.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.560]  American flag?
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.560]  We should call it Can You Hear Me Now?
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:33.980]  Which one?
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:34.660]  The guy on the phone.
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:35.400]  Oh.
[01:23:43.290 --> 01:23:44.250]  That guy looks like he's already laying.
[01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:45.150]  Yeah.
[01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:48.790]  I mean, with a nose.
[01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:49.670]  A tricycle, yeah.
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.600]  Is he gonna get his nose done or what?
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:57.060]  Uh, he's gonna.
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:00.120]  I have kept up with him.
[01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:10.400]  Why don't you go back to your hotel and put some fucking pants on?
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:11.100]  We'll walk back out here.
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:13.780]  Keep those flip flops going.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.560]  Scooter underglow.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.760]  Scooter underglow.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:19.840]  Underglow gang.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.920]  No pink taxi tonight, either.
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:22.240]  No.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:22.660]  No.
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:23.660]  Philly.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:27.940]  What's that weight up?
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:28.820]  Oh, that's a weight up.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:29.780]  That's a weight up.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:30.320]  That's a weight up.
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:31.040]  I don't have it.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:31.380]  Excellent.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:31.840]  I don't either.
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:33.940]  It's a good one, though.
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.340]  Oh, they're all YMCAing.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.740]  Well, one person.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.200]  Dude.
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.100]  Mom.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.600]  It's a pretty happy night tonight.
[01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:51.300]  I gotta say.
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.040]  Everybody seems to be in a real good mood.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.920]  Oh, she took a swing and pop.
[01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:00.470]  These guys are here for the tall guy convention.
[01:25:00.610 --> 01:25:01.550]  Yeah, man.
[01:25:01.890 --> 01:25:03.370]  That's some new goofing over there.
[01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.670]  Yeah, up there.
[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:06.250]  Oh, shoe pointing.
[01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:07.090]  Fist bumping.
[01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.990]  Fist bump.
[01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:09.710]  Oh, they're bumping.
[01:25:10.490 --> 01:25:11.930]  Oh, she's doing the fucking thing with her phone.
[01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.930]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:14.190 --> 01:25:16.330]  Oh, wow. That really does happen a lot.
[01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:19.170]  Why do they do that?
[01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:20.670]  Is this guy a ref?
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:30.640]  How many you got left, Gav?
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:31.680]  Six.
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.360]  Do you really? Wow, I have nine left.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:35.060]  How about you, Eric?
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:35.820]  Nine.
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:36.980]  Nick?
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:37.780]  I have eight.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:38.280]  Andrew?
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:40.660]  Thirteen.
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:42.740]  Oh, damn.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.060]  What is the hardest one you have left, Andrew?
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:46.500]  Friction. Fourteen.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:47.380]  Oh.
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.160]  Fuck.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.280]  Maybe nose...
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.880]  Barefoot. She was barefoot.
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:53.420]  What?
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:54.760]  She's barefoot.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:55.480]  Yes, she is.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.500]  Straight up barefoot.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.040]  I'll take it.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:58.960]  I'm sorry, what was that, Andrew?
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.320]  Uh, probably either gerpal clothing or nose pick wedgie pull crotch grabs.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.460]  Oh, I'll look out for that one. That happens a lot.
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.280]  I feel like the crotch happens more than anything.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.160]  I'll look out for the crotch.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.540]  Wow, she's just straight up barefoot. That's insane.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.180]  I think, uh...
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.540]  And she dropped her shoes.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.700]  Oh, wow, she's barefoot.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.420]  Yeah, she's putting them on now.
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.540]  I think, obviously, dyed hair might be my toughest one.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.460]  Mine's gonna be on the fence about entering. I think that one's gonna be tough.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:28.140]  Also, just couple fighting her a regular fight.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.080]  Oh, that's another barefoot.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.020]  What was that?
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.080]  When it rains, it pours.
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.340]  But for you, it's like a happy rain.
[01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:44.020]  No.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.580]  Like the sun comes out.
[01:26:47.300 --> 01:26:47.700]  No.
[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.060]  It's rainin' toes.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.260]  The clouds part.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:52.900]  Toes are gross.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:53.760]  Hallelujah.
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.600]  Toes are gross. Arches are where it's at.
[01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.280]  Absolutely. He told me all about it.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:02.440]  I just have flat feet.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.760]  So the arch is interesting.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.280]  Nick, you get $48,000.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:14.340]  But your heels are in the middle.
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:17.920]  Here?
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.000]  So, do they slide back temporarily, or how does it work?
[01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.080]  It's just your heel, where it is now, is in the middle.
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.720]  You gotta, like, rock on it.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.340]  $48,000?
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:32.260]  That's a terrible idea.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:33.300]  Tax-free?
[01:27:33.740 --> 01:27:34.280]  Tax-free.
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:41.540]  Is he just getting tiny feet, or is he getting an additional heel?
[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.440]  No, the rest of his arch will be at the back.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.280]  What?
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:51.140]  So is it just like, I'm shifting forward, and there's an arch back here?
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.460]  Yeah, like, some of the middle goes behind your ankle.
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:57.860]  Am I a parrot?
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:03.200]  It is, you get a little parrot-footed, yeah.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.540]  I'm not quite sure how it would work.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.520]  Alright, Nick, you get $1,000,000 tax-free.
[01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:12.160]  But you have parrot feet for the rest of your life.
[01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.840]  They're full-size, you know.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:16.640]  Give me the money.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:17.820]  Wow.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.600]  You would take a million dollars to have parrot feet?
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.040]  Fuck it, dude, I'll wear shoes, I don't care.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:22.920]  Dude, I don't, can you wear...
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.240]  What shoes would you wear?
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.340]  It might be incredibly painful.
[01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:25.940]  You think it'd be painful?
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:27.620]  They're fucking wide-ass, parrot feet.
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:28.580]  I could hang upside down.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:29.560]  That's true.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.180]  Like a bat.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.480]  She's fucking littered.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.620]  You suck, lady.
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:34.680]  Man.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:35.680]  Motherfucker.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:40.360]  For some reason, cigarettes just don't count as litter for some people.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:42.720]  Goddamn.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:52.180]  Looks like the stroke of midnight has occurred in Key West, so I think it's a bachelorette party.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.900]  Oh, she was just congratulated.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:29:02.070]  Well, I was five away.
[01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.550]  Yeah.
[01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:04.130]  Tough.
[01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:06.530]  Five away.
[01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:09.710]  Much closer than anybody else.
[01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:10.090]  It's incredible.
[01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:10.990]  I won two cakes.
[01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:11.650]  What a time.
[01:29:12.090 --> 01:29:12.650]  Yeah, where are they?
[01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.510]  I don't know.
[01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:15.530]  Wait for him when he gets home.
[01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:16.210]  Yeah, yeah, I mean...
[01:29:16.210 --> 01:29:18.630]  He texted the biker earlier and said, have the cakes ready.
[01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:19.570]  I said two, he said two cakes.
[01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:21.030]  That was a chug.
[01:29:21.310 --> 01:29:22.230]  That was a head-shooting chug.
[01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:26.110]  Let's...
[01:29:26.110 --> 01:29:28.090]  I want to see one more thing.
[01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:29.850]  You want to give it like...
[01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:31.990]  See what the next thing we can get is and then call it?
[01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:33.470]  What's like the last thing we get?
[01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:35.750]  Let's see, we're on the lookout for one last thing.
[01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:37.670]  See what it'll be.
[01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:40.150]  That guy's chugging it.
[01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:41.870]  Nobody needs that.
[01:29:44.170 --> 01:29:45.430]  That's my problem with this, though.
[01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:46.430]  I just, I can't stop.
[01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:47.290]  It's hard to look away.
[01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:51.230]  It is hard to look away.
[01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:55.790]  And now that this channel's not on YouTube anymore, I never think to go check it out.
[01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:56.970]  Like, on TV.
[01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:59.270]  So they just have it on their own...
[01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.750]  So I never watch it anymore.
[01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:00.690]  On their own site now?
[01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:01.050]  Yeah.
[01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:02.950]  Why did they take it off YouTube?
[01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.930]  I don't know.
[01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:06.050]  I assume...
[01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:07.050]  Is it because we were watching it?
[01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:10.470]  Yeah, it's getting too popular if I were to take it off YouTube.
[01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:16.790]  I assume during Fantasy Fest or whatever, it probably breaks a lot of terms of service.
[01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:18.070]  Yeah, too much nudity or something.
[01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:19.930]  I wish.
[01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:23.390]  Halloween was a little scary.
[01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:23.950]  Yeah.
[01:30:25.970 --> 01:30:27.810]  Oh, that was, was that a mullet crossing the street?
[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.670]  Yeah.
[01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:30.210]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:30.570]  That's a mullet.
[01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:31.150]  That was a mullet.
[01:30:31.730 --> 01:30:32.450]  Absolute mullet.
[01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.730]  Yeah.
[01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:33.830]  Don't have it, but...
[01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:34.570]  I don't have it either.
[01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:35.590]  Oh, I don't have it either.
[01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:36.350]  Oh, Andrew's got it.
[01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:37.130]  Alright, there we go.
[01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:37.530]  Alright.
[01:30:38.710 --> 01:30:40.450]  Jeans and almost flip-flops.
[01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:41.430]  Oh, is it?
[01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:42.630]  Oh, they're just sandals.
[01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:43.250]  Oh, they're just sandals.
[01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:44.210]  Wait, what about behind?
[01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:45.470]  Oh, no, she doesn't have jeans on.
[01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:46.070]  No, those aren't jeans.
[01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.570]  Damn.
[01:30:47.290 --> 01:30:48.390]  Yeah, it's a rough one.
[01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:51.170]  Well, I guess that's it then.
[01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:52.070]  We can call it.
[01:30:52.130 --> 01:30:53.930]  Andrew gets the last prompt.
[01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:54.910]  Of the evening.
[01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:55.870]  Congratulations, Andrew.
[01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:56.770]  Congrats, man.
[01:30:56.890 --> 01:30:57.350]  Thank you.
[01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:58.950]  That was a lot of great gets tonight.
[01:30:59.130 --> 01:31:00.150]  Yeah, it was a good one.
[01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:03.450]  It was a fun return to Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:04.650]  It's been too long.
[01:31:04.650 --> 01:31:07.090]  It's probably the longest we've gone between playing it.
[01:31:07.150 --> 01:31:10.170]  Let's try and not let an entire quarter go by without doing one.
[01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:10.410]  Yeah.
[01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.950]  I'm right there with you.
[01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:14.290]  Well, now that we have this place too, yeah.
[01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:15.530]  This is so much easier.
[01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:16.370]  This is great.
[01:31:16.690 --> 01:31:17.430]  Okay, what about this?
[01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.810]  Yeah.
[01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:19.190]  Imagine this, right?
[01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.870]  Okay.
[01:31:20.050 --> 01:31:20.550]  This TV.
[01:31:20.730 --> 01:31:21.050]  Okay.
[01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:22.310]  Geoff hates it.
[01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.430]  Geoff hates it.
[01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.710]  Another one.
[01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:24.010]  Yeah.
[01:31:24.410 --> 01:31:24.930]  Put it here.
[01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.390]  Okay.
[01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:26.430]  The other angle.
[01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:28.310]  And we'll recreate the street.
[01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:32.410]  We will actually see the corner street.
[01:31:32.690 --> 01:31:34.510]  Oh, we can build it out.
[01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:35.190]  It's pretty crazy.
[01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:36.550]  We can build the world.
[01:31:36.610 --> 01:31:39.170]  We can have the entire street corner in our office.
[01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:40.770]  We can do that.
[01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:45.510]  God, we can even do the inside bar on a wall TV over here.
[01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:46.610]  Wow.
[01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:48.070]  Because they have like four cams.
[01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:48.750]  I was already leaning in.
[01:31:49.150 --> 01:31:50.650]  Oh my God.
[01:31:51.330 --> 01:31:53.590]  Kevin, that's a phenomenal idea.
[01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:55.010]  How would we show it?
[01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.690]  Just like Roku?
[01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.810]  Like Sling TV?
[01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:58.290]  Like throw it up there?
[01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:59.110]  Use those on YouTube.
[01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.390]  Yeah.
[01:31:59.390 --> 01:32:00.190]  Or just...
[01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:00.630]  Yeah.
[01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:02.990]  We didn't even talk about Geoff's jammies.
[01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:04.530]  Thank you guys so much for watching.
[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:07.150]  This has been Sloppy Joe's Bingo.
[01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:09.550]  I'm owed two cakes.
[01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:12.790]  How many cakes did you win tonight, audience?
[01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.710]  Yeah, let us know.
[01:32:14.090 --> 01:32:15.730]  And hopefully you enjoyed this.
