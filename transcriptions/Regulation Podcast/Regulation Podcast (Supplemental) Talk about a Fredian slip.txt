[00:00.000 --> 00:03.860]  And this also means that people can mail stuff into the P.O. Box
[00:03.860 --> 00:06.660]  because it won't go to your house where your wife will kill me.
[00:06.920 --> 00:09.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the P.O. Box is now officially open.
[00:09.980 --> 00:11.440]  Send mail to...
[00:17.240 --> 00:20.940]  22-40 and slip. Send mail to Regulation Company.
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.040]  I think it's P.O. Box 13-14-6, Austin, Texas.
[00:25.760 --> 00:28.480]  Anybody know what the zip code is? I don't have it on the top of my head.
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.540]  Yeah, 1901 East 51st Street.
[00:31.560 --> 00:33.200]  No, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[00:33.520 --> 00:33.860]  Fucking idiot.
[00:34.840 --> 00:38.200]  787-01. I think it's 787-01 is the zip code.
[00:38.340 --> 00:41.740]  We'll have one of the logs in the chat. Pin it.
[00:41.760 --> 00:45.380]  If you're watching on Twitch, we'll have them pin the P.O. Box.
[00:46.060 --> 00:48.060]  Send it to Rooster T3.
[00:48.280 --> 00:52.480]  All the myriad of companies I've created are spinning around in my head at all times.
[00:52.580 --> 00:53.680]  They all start with R. It's incredible.
