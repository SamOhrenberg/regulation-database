[00:00.000 --> 00:03.740]  I think one of you four is going to get divorced in the year 2025.
[00:03.840 --> 00:04.640]  Holy shit!
[00:05.260 --> 00:10.820]  Marriages have a 50% success rate on the US on average.
[00:11.220 --> 00:16.860]  I'm not pulling for it, but statistically speaking, it seems possible.
[00:17.600 --> 00:20.580]  Who have you been talking to lately? Just out of curiosity?
[00:20.760 --> 00:23.620]  We're playing a dangerous game all of a sudden.
[00:23.820 --> 00:27.080]  I haven't been talking to anybody. I'm just looking at the data.
[00:27.460 --> 00:28.240]  I'm floored.
[00:29.040 --> 00:30.580]  Regulation divorce in 2025.
[00:30.920 --> 00:32.280]  That's your opening pick?
[00:32.480 --> 00:34.880]  That's my first pick, because it's 50%.
[00:34.880 --> 00:37.280]  And I don't want it for any of you. I want to be clear.
[00:37.440 --> 00:41.480]  I don't want this to be accurate, but if I'm trying to win...
[00:41.480 --> 00:43.300]  No, yeah, you do. You do want it to be accurate.
[00:43.880 --> 00:44.220]  Yes, you do.
[00:44.220 --> 00:45.420]  No, I do want it.
[00:45.900 --> 00:46.800]  There's two separate things.
[00:46.940 --> 00:48.280]  No, you absolutely want it to happen.
[00:48.300 --> 00:50.040]  Because if you want to win, you want it to happen.
[00:50.380 --> 00:51.240]  There's two separate things.
[00:51.500 --> 00:54.740]  This pick is so evil, I'm holding your feet to the fire.
