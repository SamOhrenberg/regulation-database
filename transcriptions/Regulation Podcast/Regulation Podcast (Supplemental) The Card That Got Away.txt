[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  I was thinking about Pokemon the other day and thinking probably the biggest destruction
[00:03.840 --> 00:08.960]  of wealth that I've ever been a part of, like the most money I've ever lost, was just opening
[00:08.960 --> 00:13.820]  my Pokemon cards as a kid. Absolutely. Like if I just for some reason accidentally forgot
[00:13.820 --> 00:17.620]  to open them, they sell for like hundreds of thousands of dollars, like an unopened
[00:17.620 --> 00:21.440]  original starter pack or whatever. It makes me want to just buy one of everything and
[00:21.440 --> 00:26.940]  keep it and never use it. I remember for my birthday when I was like maybe, I don't know,
[00:26.940 --> 00:31.720]  six or seven. But I just remember getting a Charizard card from like the original set
[00:31.720 --> 00:36.160]  and it was like $70 and that was my big gift. And just thinking about like the value of
[00:36.160 --> 00:41.060]  that now. I have no idea where it is. Probably ruined it. Absolutely ruined it as a child.
[00:41.400 --> 00:42.560]  Those sell for so much now.
