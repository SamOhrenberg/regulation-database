[00:00.760 --> 00:02.640]  Yeah, we can do that while the pies are in the oven.
[00:02.660 --> 00:03.020]  Exactly.
[00:03.700 --> 00:04.420]  Just in case.
[00:07.280 --> 00:07.640]  Little...
[00:08.060 --> 00:09.060]  Oh, look at them go!
[00:09.080 --> 00:09.440]  Tony!
[00:10.200 --> 00:10.920]  It's croutons!
[00:12.120 --> 00:12.880]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[00:12.900 --> 00:13.620]  That is a lot.
[00:13.680 --> 00:14.080]  It's an apple.
[00:14.380 --> 00:15.140]  Here's what we have.
[00:15.180 --> 00:18.480]  We have a hundred hand-counted croutons in each bowl.
[00:20.260 --> 00:22.120]  Gracie counted hers, so...
[00:22.120 --> 00:22.680]  Who knows?
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.440]  Can you trust it?
[00:23.480 --> 00:24.540]  Who knows if we can trust it?
[00:24.560 --> 00:24.720]  Well, here's what we do.
[00:24.980 --> 00:26.020]  We swap the bowls.
[00:26.220 --> 00:26.400]  Oh!
[00:28.320 --> 00:29.180]  All right, here we go.
[00:29.180 --> 00:29.660]  You're a genius!
[00:30.200 --> 00:31.280]  You're so fucking smart.
[00:31.380 --> 00:32.420]  There are, in fact, a hundred in there.
[00:33.060 --> 00:33.980]  Well, good luck with those.
[00:36.020 --> 00:37.420]  There's also a hundred in there.
[00:37.720 --> 00:38.440]  Yeah, so...
[00:38.440 --> 00:39.600]  Dude, you got some honkers in there.
[00:39.620 --> 00:40.320]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:40.420 --> 00:41.540]  What is it with the size?
[00:41.620 --> 00:42.460]  That's a sandwich!
[00:42.540 --> 00:43.020]  Look at these.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.220]  So, Gracie...
[00:44.220 --> 00:44.520]  What?
[00:44.880 --> 00:46.220]  Gracie picked the croutons.
[00:46.580 --> 00:48.240]  There's no drinking in the competition.
[00:48.540 --> 00:52.020]  There will be a lubing period in the beginning now.
[00:53.020 --> 00:53.420]  Pre-lube?
[00:53.640 --> 00:54.440]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:54.440 --> 00:55.900]  Just to kind of, like, wet your whistle.
[00:56.280 --> 01:00.420]  And this started because I challenged Gracie to a crouton-off.
[01:00.500 --> 01:00.620]  Yeah.
[01:00.660 --> 01:01.600]  I don't remember why.
[01:01.700 --> 01:04.040]  I think it's because I said that a crouton is like a snack.
[01:04.200 --> 01:05.040]  Yeah, this is the crouton.
[01:05.300 --> 01:06.680]  Then it turned into a contest.
[01:07.120 --> 01:10.940]  So, we're gonna see who gets to a hundred first or just who gets further first.
[01:11.500 --> 01:14.040]  I don't see myself giving up, but I definitely see myself slowing down.
[01:14.520 --> 01:14.940]  That's fine.
[01:16.060 --> 01:18.940]  It would be insane if you were the same speed the whole way through.
[01:19.460 --> 01:20.420]  I gotta be honest with you.
[01:21.220 --> 01:22.660]  I'm not as young as I used to be.
[01:22.900 --> 01:23.180]  I can't...
[01:23.180 --> 01:24.920]  These competitions get harder as you get older.
[01:24.980 --> 01:25.500]  So, I don't know.
[01:25.500 --> 01:26.180]  I don't want to count out.
[01:26.180 --> 01:27.040]  Did you count this as one?
[01:28.500 --> 01:30.560]  I either counted it as one or I didn't count it at all.
[01:31.420 --> 01:32.880]  I see someone left this one out.
[01:32.880 --> 01:33.980]  I made sure mine were all pretty good.
[01:33.980 --> 01:34.180]  Yeah, I know.
[01:34.660 --> 01:35.420]  I'll take that one.
[01:35.500 --> 01:35.800]  Thank you.
[01:36.700 --> 01:38.540]  Like, I didn't give myself any of these.
[01:38.700 --> 01:39.560]  Well, you've got it now.
[01:39.600 --> 01:40.160]  Yeah, I guess not.
[01:40.160 --> 01:40.540]  Enjoy it.
[01:40.940 --> 01:41.540]  I've gotta be switched.
[01:41.560 --> 01:42.080]  I don't care.
[01:42.800 --> 01:45.160]  Lubing period is still enacted right now.
[01:45.220 --> 01:45.820]  So, you can lube.
[01:46.380 --> 01:47.460]  Are you just eating cheese?
[01:47.700 --> 01:47.920]  Yeah.
[01:48.340 --> 01:49.920]  Tell us when to stop lubing and when to go.
[01:50.100 --> 01:50.560]  All right.
[01:51.460 --> 01:51.780]  Sorry.
[01:52.220 --> 01:53.000]  Are you guys ready?
[01:55.020 --> 01:55.420]  Yeah.
[01:55.420 --> 01:55.960]  Are you prepared?
[01:56.300 --> 01:56.700]  Yeah.
[01:56.820 --> 01:59.220]  Do you guys have any fighting words for each other before we start?
[01:59.320 --> 02:00.440]  Best of luck, you fucking loser.
[02:03.480 --> 02:05.220]  After this, we'll be quitting this job.
[02:07.320 --> 02:07.720]  No.
[02:08.780 --> 02:09.360]  All right, here we go.
[02:09.460 --> 02:09.900]  Are you ready?
[02:10.280 --> 02:12.580]  On your mark, get set, go.
[02:13.420 --> 02:13.840]  Roo-tah.
[02:14.240 --> 02:15.020]  Roo-tah.
[02:15.180 --> 02:15.640]  Roo-tah.
[02:16.140 --> 02:17.100]  That was a good crew time.
[02:17.540 --> 02:17.820]  Uh-huh.
[02:18.160 --> 02:18.820]  There's a little mistake.
[02:19.260 --> 02:19.540]  One.
[02:19.980 --> 02:20.900]  That was wily.
[02:21.220 --> 02:21.520]  Uh-huh.
[02:21.580 --> 02:21.780]  Two.
[02:22.200 --> 02:22.560]  Yeah, I know.
[02:22.560 --> 02:23.540]  They are...
[02:23.540 --> 02:24.260]  They are...
[02:25.120 --> 02:25.480]  Thick.
[02:25.700 --> 02:27.820]  I feel like this would just wreck the roof of my mouth.
[02:27.900 --> 02:28.000]  Yeah.
[02:29.900 --> 02:32.600]  It's not gonna make you feel bad, like, oh, my stomach.
[02:32.980 --> 02:36.880]  It's just gonna make you go like, ah, my mouth is so dry and I've eaten so much sodium.
[02:37.160 --> 02:38.560]  I'm gonna need a floss after this.
[02:38.660 --> 02:38.900]  Mm-hmm.
[02:39.720 --> 02:41.140]  You might be a little full when you're done.
[02:41.640 --> 02:43.780]  So again, there's no drinking in this competition.
[02:44.240 --> 02:47.980]  We were gonna do this where we had them eat croutons for 25 minutes.
[02:48.100 --> 02:48.360]  What?
[02:48.460 --> 02:50.040]  And then eat croutons for 10 minutes.
[02:50.400 --> 02:51.800]  And then eat croutons for 5 minutes.
[02:52.560 --> 02:56.080]  I think 5 minutes would have been fine, because there's no way you're getting through 100.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.240]  No, we'll be here for 5.
[02:57.440 --> 02:57.640]  Yeah.
[02:58.200 --> 02:59.480]  10% of the way through.
[02:59.640 --> 03:01.260]  Didn't understand a word of that.
[03:01.320 --> 03:02.260]  10% of the way through.
[03:02.320 --> 03:02.500]  Oh, okay.
[03:02.500 --> 03:03.120]  10% of the way through.
[03:03.160 --> 03:04.080]  I'll translate for Geoff.
[03:04.200 --> 03:06.840]  I feel like the, uh, it's going slower than I thought.
[03:06.880 --> 03:09.840]  I thought it'd be faster at the beginning, but it seems like these are real mouthfuls.
[03:09.880 --> 03:10.060]  Yeah, they are.
[03:10.060 --> 03:11.080]  My mouth is already dry.
[03:11.600 --> 03:11.860]  It's hard.
[03:11.940 --> 03:12.300]  They're...
[03:12.300 --> 03:13.200]  I mean, here's the thing.
[03:14.020 --> 03:16.880]  Look at how big these fucking croutons are.
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.960]  Also, Geoff is going, like, one at a time.
[03:20.040 --> 03:22.280]  Grace is doing, like, handfuls.
[03:23.640 --> 03:24.040]  Fuck.
[03:28.640 --> 03:29.760]  This is intimidating.
[03:30.100 --> 03:30.600]  This is...
[03:30.600 --> 03:31.820]  You've not made a dent.
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.700]  If I laugh, I'm going to throw up.
[03:33.840 --> 03:35.340]  14% of the way through.
[03:36.040 --> 03:36.860]  I'm having a freakout.
[03:36.860 --> 03:37.240]  Throw up.
[03:39.260 --> 03:41.560]  Are you trying to annihilate your honkers before...
[03:41.560 --> 03:41.760]  Yeah.
[03:42.060 --> 03:42.260]  Yeah.
[03:42.260 --> 03:42.460]  Hold on.
[03:42.580 --> 03:43.020]  Good idea.
[03:43.600 --> 03:44.260]  I'm getting the big ones all the way.
[03:44.260 --> 03:45.780]  You have less of a percentage on the back end.
[03:47.300 --> 03:48.580]  Fuck, this is dry as shit.
[03:52.900 --> 03:54.420]  Oh, the crunch.
[03:55.180 --> 03:55.940]  That was loud.
[03:56.860 --> 03:58.080]  If I can get to 20, I can get to 21.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.260]  It's amazing that Emily's doing this in front of you guys.
[04:00.340 --> 04:00.900]  She's pretty private.
[04:01.200 --> 04:01.520]  Oh, are you?
[04:02.460 --> 04:03.140]  What she does...
[04:03.140 --> 04:03.940]  I'm making the crown.
[04:04.240 --> 04:05.020]  She loves...
[04:05.020 --> 04:06.160]  What she likes to do...
[04:06.160 --> 04:07.980]  Oh, that's such a great idea.
[04:08.840 --> 04:10.460]  She likes to tape all the garbage together.
[04:10.740 --> 04:12.180]  So it's easier for the trashman.
[04:12.660 --> 04:15.020]  She puts every piece of garbage that's taped to every other piece of garbage.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.220]  So it's just, like, one long trail.
[04:16.380 --> 04:17.020]  What a great idea.
[04:17.440 --> 04:18.960]  It's the crouton crown.
[04:19.380 --> 04:20.260]  It's the what?
[04:20.400 --> 04:21.680]  The crouton crown.
[04:21.880 --> 04:22.180]  Crouton.
[04:22.900 --> 04:23.380]  Crouton.
[04:23.700 --> 04:23.840]  Crouton.
[04:24.600 --> 04:25.080]  Crouton.
[04:25.920 --> 04:27.160]  The crouton and the crouton.
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.740]  How's it going, gang?
[04:29.400 --> 04:31.380]  Yeah, this is like living in crouton.
[04:36.270 --> 04:37.330]  Where are you going?
[04:37.650 --> 04:38.950]  I'm just gonna take a walk.
[04:39.830 --> 04:45.410]  Do you think when people listen to this podcast, this is the kind of stuff they're stoked on?
[04:45.910 --> 04:50.610]  Oh, dude, I want to watch the host and the associate producer eat crouton.
[04:50.690 --> 04:52.150]  I mean, I genuinely...
[04:52.150 --> 04:52.890]  Oh, yeah, I love this.
[04:53.370 --> 04:54.350]  I can't wait.
[04:54.350 --> 04:56.290]  Every time somebody asks me to do a work, I'm like...
[04:56.290 --> 04:57.990]  What don't I do?
[04:58.310 --> 04:58.650]  Describing...
[04:58.650 --> 05:00.210]  Yeah, I'm like, it's a little hard to say.
[05:00.230 --> 05:01.470]  We've all gone through this...
[05:01.470 --> 05:03.110]  Come to Mouthful of Crouton!
[05:04.470 --> 05:08.610]  We've all gone through this for a long time where we've worked in media or at this company or whatever,
[05:08.770 --> 05:10.870]  and our parents, I think, probably just sort of go,
[05:10.970 --> 05:12.310]  okay, yeah, we figured it out, whatever.
[05:12.770 --> 05:15.410]  You're brand new to this, and I can't imagine...
[05:15.410 --> 05:15.990]  The explanation.
[05:16.190 --> 05:18.990]  How much would you guys pay for a sip of water right now?
[05:19.050 --> 05:19.870]  Or a sip of liquid?
[05:20.310 --> 05:21.990]  I'm really broke, so I wouldn't pay for anything.
[05:22.450 --> 05:22.810]  Jesus!
[05:23.790 --> 05:26.690]  How many croutons would you sacrifice to possibly lose?
[05:27.110 --> 05:28.250]  I guess it's not amounts time.
[05:28.390 --> 05:30.550]  You would know how many you would get out of the bowl.
[05:30.950 --> 05:33.010]  What if a sip was adding 10 croutons?
[05:33.030 --> 05:35.690]  Yeah, if you add 10 croutons, you can have a sip.
[05:35.890 --> 05:36.050]  No.
[05:36.810 --> 05:37.130]  Wow!
[05:38.530 --> 05:40.790]  I'm 25. I'm a quarter of the way through this bitch.
[05:40.870 --> 05:41.750]  I'm not even counting.
[05:42.110 --> 05:42.890]  Yeah, you should be.
[05:43.610 --> 05:45.590]  If you had to look right now, who do you think's in the lead?
[05:46.050 --> 05:46.690]  I would say...
[05:47.810 --> 05:48.610]  Wow, it's close.
[05:48.610 --> 05:49.370]  It's pretty close.
[05:49.870 --> 05:51.290]  Well, now Geoff is picking it up.
[05:51.890 --> 05:56.350]  I just had the biggest urge to reach in and just grab one of Geoff's croutons and eat it, but I can't.
[05:56.530 --> 05:57.330]  No, I don't want to.
[05:57.350 --> 05:58.050]  No, I don't want to!
[05:58.350 --> 05:59.070]  It was just...
[05:59.070 --> 06:00.110]  When you see croutons...
[06:00.110 --> 06:00.570]  Thank you.
[06:00.690 --> 06:02.310]  When you see croutons, there's an inclination.
[06:02.710 --> 06:03.190]  It's exciting.
[06:03.570 --> 06:04.610]  I should've worn stretcher pants.
[06:06.030 --> 06:07.490]  I think there's less in this bowl.
[06:08.310 --> 06:09.390]  I think you might be right.
[06:09.590 --> 06:10.070]  It's tough.
[06:10.190 --> 06:11.130]  Geoff also has a massive...
[06:11.530 --> 06:13.750]  There is a quarter piece of bread right...
[06:13.750 --> 06:14.350]  Look at that.
[06:14.910 --> 06:16.130]  Oh my god!
[06:17.330 --> 06:18.370]  Very different techniques.
[06:18.370 --> 06:22.290]  Gracie is sort of grounded in. She's like dug in. And Geoff is all over the room.
[06:22.910 --> 06:23.790]  She's zooming, man.
[06:25.210 --> 06:27.130]  Wow, he's going in bursts though. That was a sprint.
[06:27.430 --> 06:29.090]  I don't think Gracie's moved an inch.
[06:30.470 --> 06:30.890]  She's dug in.
[06:30.910 --> 06:31.750]  Gracie's in the zone.
[06:32.430 --> 06:33.030]  She's unlocked him.
[06:33.030 --> 06:34.010]  She didn't come here to fuck around.
[06:34.470 --> 06:34.950]  Unlocked him!
[06:36.010 --> 06:37.030]  What's his name? Joey Chestnut?
[06:37.230 --> 06:37.430]  Yeah.
[06:37.890 --> 06:38.470]  Nothing on me.
[06:39.970 --> 06:43.010]  Now, what is feeling the wear and tear? Is the jaw aching at this point?
[06:43.050 --> 06:43.390]  A little bit.
[06:43.490 --> 06:44.290]  Or is it the inside of the mouth hurting?
[06:44.290 --> 06:44.830]  It's just dry.
[06:45.010 --> 06:46.930]  Is it your throat, esophagus?
[06:47.110 --> 06:47.370]  No.
[06:48.490 --> 06:52.190]  It's a lot of croutons. It's just the flavor. At some point, you're like...
[06:52.710 --> 06:56.090]  And are you feeling it in the gut yet? Or is it still just a whole mouth issue?
[06:56.690 --> 06:57.690]  I feel it in the vom.
[06:58.410 --> 06:59.390]  Oh, the vom.
[06:59.490 --> 07:00.070]  If you throw up.
[07:01.250 --> 07:02.150]  Like you feel it in your gut?
[07:02.510 --> 07:04.770]  Like too much of a good thing. You know, you start to feel it in your tummy.
[07:04.950 --> 07:08.770]  If I see you throw up, I will involuntarily throw up.
[07:08.830 --> 07:12.570]  My tummy's down there going like, appreciate it, but maybe we stop now.
[07:12.810 --> 07:14.070]  Nick is getting a puke bag ready.
[07:14.110 --> 07:15.990]  Just in case, you know. Here, you can pull that right off.
[07:16.560 --> 07:18.890]  I feel like you guys have made a significant dent now.
[07:19.030 --> 07:20.650]  I'm impressed.
[07:22.830 --> 07:23.670]  The handfuls.
[07:24.390 --> 07:27.310]  Don't forget, if you add just 10 croutons, you can have a drink.
[07:27.830 --> 07:29.150]  Just 10 little croutons?
[07:29.170 --> 07:31.430]  There may be a fire sale coming up for 5 croutons.
[07:31.470 --> 07:31.890]  Wow.
[07:32.870 --> 07:36.790]  Eventually, it might become a 5 crouton fire sale.
[07:36.910 --> 07:37.750]  If we're taking too long.
[07:37.970 --> 07:40.090]  No, no, no. If you want a swig of liquid.
[07:40.310 --> 07:41.770]  For a swig. Limited time.
[07:42.030 --> 07:44.270]  How much is a swig versus a gulp?
[07:45.250 --> 07:46.970]  Between a glug and a slurp.
[07:48.010 --> 07:50.730]  Either way, I think it can only be one drink.
[07:50.950 --> 07:52.870]  I don't know if that would help. It might put more in my stomach.
[07:53.090 --> 07:55.930]  It's true. It might expand all your bread.
[07:56.790 --> 07:57.970]  What a great one.
[08:00.010 --> 08:00.430]  What do you think?
[08:01.210 --> 08:03.630]  I feel like...
[08:03.630 --> 08:04.830]  That is deceptively...
[08:04.830 --> 08:06.570]  Don't be deceived by the size of the bowl.
[08:08.550 --> 08:12.490]  I do appreciate that there's a paper lining inside so that the crouton grease isn't on there.
[08:13.450 --> 08:15.050]  Oh, wow. Gracie's already thinking about wearing it.
[08:15.090 --> 08:15.670]  That's pretty cool.
[08:19.570 --> 08:21.630]  Gracie might be in the fucking lead right now.
[08:21.790 --> 08:22.910]  Gracie's kicking credit.
[08:23.670 --> 08:26.290]  Because she's not taking a jog in the middle of it.
[08:26.530 --> 08:27.770]  She's not wasting energy.
[08:28.270 --> 08:31.030]  Geoff isn't wasting chew time. He's always got something in his mouth.
[08:31.090 --> 08:35.030]  It's true, but I wonder if he's trying to trick us and he's gonna go throw some of these at the dog.
[08:35.290 --> 08:37.450]  I would never give the dog people food.
[08:37.450 --> 08:38.750]  He said the dog's not allowed to eat people's food.
[08:39.070 --> 08:40.690]  Right, that's what he says, but now his back's against the wall.
[08:40.690 --> 08:43.130]  He said that in our minds, so we think about it.
[08:43.130 --> 08:43.910]  Where is the dog?
[08:44.990 --> 08:47.390]  How many per handful are you going for, usually?
[08:48.470 --> 08:49.370]  Three to four.
[08:49.650 --> 08:50.270]  It's all up for you.
[08:50.790 --> 08:51.530]  I know, I'm gonna move out.
[08:52.830 --> 08:53.750]  It's like on my face.
[08:54.310 --> 08:56.370]  Let me size out your head real quick.
[08:56.650 --> 08:57.810]  While you're eating, don't slap.
[08:58.470 --> 08:59.570]  It's pretty good.
[09:00.330 --> 09:02.610]  So she'll be up there. Let me see your head.
[09:03.650 --> 09:04.930]  Gotta be similar size.
[09:05.490 --> 09:07.350]  Similar size head? Yours is a little bit bigger.
[09:07.670 --> 09:08.110]  I would hope.
[09:08.110 --> 09:10.750]  I didn't anticipate getting nauseous, but it just happened.
[09:11.070 --> 09:11.410]  Really?
[09:14.650 --> 09:17.090]  I wonder if it's like when you drink something.
[09:17.230 --> 09:18.550]  Is it just gonna make it all swell up?
[09:18.630 --> 09:19.550]  It's gonna hit my tongue.
[09:19.830 --> 09:20.990]  It'll be like those foam things.
[09:23.290 --> 09:24.710]  Geoff's eyes are so wide.
[09:27.130 --> 09:28.350]  Geoff's not feeling good.
[09:29.010 --> 09:30.770]  These are good croutons though.
[09:30.850 --> 09:32.430]  They were good a while ago.
[09:33.370 --> 09:35.030]  The first six were awful.
[09:36.050 --> 09:38.870]  The last 53 or so have been pretty rough.
[09:40.950 --> 09:41.690]  Let's see.
[09:42.110 --> 09:44.610]  One serving is 80mg of sodium.
[09:45.570 --> 09:47.930]  And that's 3% of your daily value.
[09:48.170 --> 09:49.770]  This is 60% of your daily.
[09:50.070 --> 09:52.470]  So you can have 33 before you've maxed out your sodium?
[09:52.930 --> 09:53.410]  Nice.
[09:53.610 --> 09:54.590]  So they're eating 100.
[09:55.810 --> 09:57.250]  You're having three days worth of sodium.
[09:57.830 --> 09:59.150]  No more sodium this week.
[10:01.370 --> 10:03.230]  Gracie seems to be slowing down and compressing.
[10:03.230 --> 10:04.130]  It's true.
[10:04.350 --> 10:06.750]  Geoff might be sprinting to catch up.
[10:07.230 --> 10:09.030]  This could be a close finish.
[10:18.090 --> 10:19.390]  What about on your front?
[10:20.330 --> 10:21.470]  It might be laid down on your front.
[10:22.090 --> 10:26.270]  Go to the bar.
[10:26.510 --> 10:27.590]  It was so immediate.
[10:35.930 --> 10:37.310]  Geoff doesn't want to lose.
[10:37.850 --> 10:39.510]  Geoff doesn't want to go from this to lose.
[10:39.710 --> 10:40.770]  My eyes are rolling back.
[10:40.950 --> 10:43.010]  Geoff, you're in the driest desert in the world.
[10:46.470 --> 10:48.130]  I'm all falling back out.
[10:48.250 --> 10:49.410]  You have to take a break.
[10:49.410 --> 10:50.870]  I want to win.
[10:52.850 --> 10:54.210]  This is for you, Emily.
[10:54.410 --> 10:55.350]  He says he wants to win.
[10:55.950 --> 10:57.750]  Let's see what that did for the...
[10:57.750 --> 10:58.690]  It's so close.
[10:58.910 --> 11:00.750]  Gracie's got it.
[11:02.330 --> 11:03.450]  Get him in, son.
[11:11.170 --> 11:13.170]  He's going for psychological warfare.
[11:13.510 --> 11:14.110]  It's working.
[11:16.490 --> 11:17.730]  Don't look at him.
[11:18.430 --> 11:19.790]  Gracie, you have to focus.
[11:31.670 --> 11:35.750]  The middle finger covered in crouton dust.
[11:36.710 --> 11:37.990]  It's so good.
[11:39.610 --> 11:40.330]  Oh, yes.
[11:48.170 --> 11:50.570]  Are there any small enough you can just swallow like a pill?
[11:50.930 --> 11:52.030]  Oh, my God, don't do that.
[11:53.230 --> 11:53.590]  Ew!
[11:54.710 --> 11:55.550]  Don't look at him.
[11:56.290 --> 11:57.110]  Oh, my God.
[11:58.890 --> 12:00.110]  They're back at the waxing.
[12:00.170 --> 12:00.830]  Don't look at him.
[12:04.070 --> 12:05.330]  It's hard to tell what's left.
[12:05.910 --> 12:06.930]  It looks like stuffing.
[12:08.390 --> 12:11.430]  Yeah, he's about to get stuffing in his face.
[12:12.950 --> 12:15.830]  You'd add ten croutons.
[12:16.230 --> 12:17.070]  Easy drink, baby.
[12:17.910 --> 12:20.150]  Think of the lubrication you'll get.
[12:21.650 --> 12:23.010]  It's all in his beard.
[12:25.390 --> 12:27.250]  If I had a beard, it'd be all over me.
[12:27.490 --> 12:28.730]  Gracie, you're almost there.
[12:31.190 --> 12:32.970]  You got the crouton sweats?
[12:33.670 --> 12:34.030]  Geoff, Geoff.
[12:38.490 --> 12:40.510]  Are you skanking him?
[12:41.410 --> 12:43.010]  He's tripping the croutons down.
[12:43.510 --> 12:44.390]  He's tripping them down.
[12:47.370 --> 12:49.670]  When the show started...
[12:50.490 --> 12:51.670]  Oh, my God.
[12:52.670 --> 12:53.570]  Oh, Geoff.
[12:53.710 --> 12:54.870]  Geoff, you gotta catch up.
[12:56.430 --> 12:57.790]  Geoff, last-ditch effort.
[12:59.290 --> 13:00.470]  I'm not done yet.
[13:00.470 --> 13:03.170]  You gotta get the crouton ready.
[13:04.370 --> 13:05.730]  Oh, Gracie, you're so close.
[13:05.870 --> 13:06.750]  Oh, she's dancing now.
[13:06.810 --> 13:08.550]  Three left.
[13:10.770 --> 13:12.350]  What am I showing?
[13:12.830 --> 13:14.110]  What are you showing?
[13:14.190 --> 13:15.870]  She stopped being just stable.
[13:16.310 --> 13:17.350]  She's dancing.
[13:22.710 --> 13:23.950]  There's two left.
[13:25.850 --> 13:27.070]  Gracie's on the last one.
[13:27.830 --> 13:28.690]  Gracie, that's it.
[13:31.030 --> 13:31.470]  Gracie!
[13:33.250 --> 13:34.710]  Wow, amazing.
[13:39.030 --> 13:39.510]  Yay!
[13:40.890 --> 13:41.570]  You're a champion.
[13:46.230 --> 13:49.250]  You made me fast growl.
[13:50.610 --> 13:51.210]  You win.
[13:53.250 --> 13:54.330]  Oh, yeah.
[13:54.490 --> 13:55.330]  Yeah, have a drink.
[13:56.670 --> 13:57.890]  How would you say you feel?
[13:58.590 --> 13:59.930]  If you had to describe it in one word.
[14:00.670 --> 14:01.150]  Sore.
[14:02.170 --> 14:03.890]  My jaw fucking hurts.
[14:04.650 --> 14:05.470]  You feel like a champ?
[14:06.190 --> 14:07.090]  But you know what?
[14:07.810 --> 14:09.470]  I swallowed every crumb.
[14:09.650 --> 14:10.310]  You did amazing.
[14:10.910 --> 14:12.330]  Gracie, you are queen crouton.
[14:12.570 --> 14:15.150]  The winner of the crouton.
[14:15.170 --> 14:16.130]  The crown feels really good.
[14:17.810 --> 14:18.310]  Congratulations.
[14:20.190 --> 14:21.810]  How many minutes was that?
[14:22.130 --> 14:22.910]  Oh, like 20.
[14:23.370 --> 14:26.050]  We ate them for 20 minutes.
[14:26.690 --> 14:28.090]  You guys ate croutons for 20 minutes.
[14:28.110 --> 14:29.230]  That was a bit of a preamble.
[14:29.410 --> 14:30.730]  But the tile is 21 minutes.
[14:31.730 --> 14:33.390]  I'm going to change that flavor out.
[14:34.690 --> 14:35.670]  Oh, there you go.
[14:41.090 --> 14:42.850]  It didn't even register.
[14:42.910 --> 14:43.990]  It's like a drain.
[14:49.990 --> 14:52.470]  This is making me sweat.
[14:52.470 --> 14:53.350]  It's a weird day.
[14:53.730 --> 14:57.250]  Everyone's got an oily crouton sheen to them.
[14:58.310 --> 15:01.050]  I think it's going to be a long time until I eat a crouton again.
[15:01.570 --> 15:02.050]  Phenomenal.
[15:03.390 --> 15:04.490]  The roof of my mouth.
[15:07.950 --> 15:08.850]  Is it red?
[15:09.110 --> 15:10.550]  It feels like...
[15:11.030 --> 15:11.790]  It's pretty instant.
[15:15.310 --> 15:17.370]  This is our call to action portion of the video.
[15:17.550 --> 15:19.290]  Well, did you like it?
[15:20.710 --> 15:21.970]  That's ****face.
[15:22.210 --> 15:23.190]  And that's the crouton.
[15:24.370 --> 15:27.370]  Do you think you can eat 100 croutons faster?
[15:28.410 --> 15:29.430]  Probably not.
