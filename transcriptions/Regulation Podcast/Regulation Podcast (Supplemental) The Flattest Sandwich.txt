[00:01.980 --> 00:02.400]  Sandwiches.
[00:06.440 --> 00:07.280]  Hold on.
[00:09.980 --> 00:10.520]  How's this?
[00:11.880 --> 00:13.580]  Turn it back on, dumbass!
[00:14.040 --> 00:16.980]  The thing about having our own place is that we can set up these lights and we can use them.
[00:17.360 --> 00:19.940]  And we don't have to worry about moving them or anything.
[00:20.980 --> 00:26.000]  So, over the weekend, Eric and I saw a TikTok of someone who fell...
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.880]  grabbed a Sub sandwich, and then fell, and then opened up the sandwich.
[00:30.060 --> 00:32.800]  It was comically flat. They flattened their sandwich.
[00:33.160 --> 00:36.620]  We immediately jumped on the idea and decided that we had to have a contest
[00:37.040 --> 00:40.780]  to see which amongst the three of us who are currently in town...
[00:41.980 --> 00:43.160]  That's how it works on regulation.
[00:43.460 --> 00:44.660]  Jesus Christ. Only in July.
[00:44.860 --> 00:46.840]  Andrew, where are you? Andrew, son!
[00:47.020 --> 00:47.760]  He's right here somewhere.
[00:48.620 --> 00:53.860]  Which of those of us that are currently in town can flatten a sandwich the most with our bodies?
[00:53.860 --> 00:57.560]  So, it was important that we got the Subway sandwich, and it was all the same.
[00:57.740 --> 01:00.040]  We got the Turkey Titan. I'm gonna actually give you a look.
[01:00.760 --> 01:02.400]  Have a look-see at our sandwiches.
[01:02.600 --> 01:05.300]  We all got the same sandwich, and Jeff's request was no mayo.
[01:05.620 --> 01:06.480]  I just asked for no mayo.
[01:06.520 --> 01:06.800]  That's fine.
[01:07.220 --> 01:10.540]  Also, by the way, we're not sponsored by... this isn't a Subway-branded thing.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.440]  We're about to smash the fuck out of these. I wouldn't think that this is...
[01:13.440 --> 01:16.220]  Yeah, no, this is just like the most bog-standard sandwich we could think of.
[01:16.240 --> 01:17.420]  So, it's a Turkey Titan.
[01:18.220 --> 01:19.080]  That's pretty good.
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.000]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.060]  We got a couple foot-longs because we figured, hey, maybe we do a couple of attempts.
[01:24.280 --> 01:27.360]  Maybe we see how this goes, and then Gavin said, well, I'm gonna eat mine, so...
[01:27.360 --> 01:28.460]  Well, I wanna eat the flat sandwich.
[01:28.580 --> 01:28.740]  Okay.
[01:29.120 --> 01:30.120]  Yeah, you gotta eat the flat sandwich.
[01:30.180 --> 01:32.500]  Gavin said he wasn't gonna be able to eat his sandwich.
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.640]  I think mine might be too flat, yeah.
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.020]  I don't believe that at all.
[01:37.080 --> 01:39.720]  So, here's how I think it should work.
[01:39.840 --> 01:40.040]  Okay.
[01:40.120 --> 01:40.940]  Let me know what you think.
[01:41.140 --> 01:44.420]  I think we each get two attempts at flattening the sandwich.
[01:44.800 --> 01:44.980]  Okay.
[01:44.980 --> 01:50.960]  So, we each have our sandwich, and then you, however you wanna do it, that's what we're gonna do.
[01:51.100 --> 01:56.740]  I noticed you brought in some, I don't know, visual aids?
[01:56.820 --> 01:59.000]  Yeah, well, I have some ideas.
[01:59.420 --> 02:00.620]  I have two different ways.
[02:00.740 --> 02:03.380]  I already knew immediately how I wanna flatten the sandwich.
[02:03.720 --> 02:03.920]  Okay.
[02:03.920 --> 02:06.200]  So, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
[02:06.220 --> 02:06.640]  You should go first.
[02:06.680 --> 02:07.300]  You want me to go first?
[02:07.320 --> 02:07.940]  I want you to go first.
[02:07.960 --> 02:08.400]  Okay, cool.
[02:09.120 --> 02:09.940]  I'll be right back.
[02:10.140 --> 02:10.340]  Okay.
[02:11.360 --> 02:11.960]  I'll be honest.
[02:11.960 --> 02:14.780]  I didn't bring in props because I thought we were just gonna use our bodies.
[02:15.200 --> 02:16.080]  I'm a little disappointed.
[02:16.620 --> 02:17.800]  Well, I got a prop.
[02:18.060 --> 02:18.660]  You got a prop, too?
[02:18.840 --> 02:19.040]  Yeah.
[02:19.420 --> 02:20.420]  I didn't bring it.
[02:20.560 --> 02:21.680]  You got a prop, buddy?
[02:22.200 --> 02:26.120]  I got this from our friend Blaine, who is...
[02:26.120 --> 02:26.620]  The wood guy.
[02:26.760 --> 02:29.500]  He's very into the idea of flattening the sandwich.
[02:29.800 --> 02:35.780]  When I told him that we were hanging out the other day, when we told him about it, he immediately had a million ideas about how to flatten the sandwich.
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.000]  Then I saw him today, and he's like, I got wood for you.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.940]  So he gave me these planks of wood.
[02:45.160 --> 02:46.840]  So were you originally gonna use wood or not?
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.660]  Yeah, I was just gonna provide my own wood.
[02:49.020 --> 02:50.880]  But then this is straight out of Blaine's garage. Boom.
[02:51.220 --> 02:51.760]  There you go.
[02:52.080 --> 02:55.600]  My first attempt here of flattening the sandwich.
[02:56.240 --> 02:58.000]  I guess I'll use...
[02:58.960 --> 02:59.620]  Let's see.
[02:59.880 --> 03:02.700]  How about I use the large paper?
[03:03.000 --> 03:05.980]  That seems pretty right to flatten this thing.
[03:06.140 --> 03:06.980]  I'm gonna put it right here.
[03:07.520 --> 03:08.120]  You pre-flatten?
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.180]  He's trying to.
[03:10.180 --> 03:11.360]  He's trying to pre-flatten.
[03:11.500 --> 03:15.080]  So, my first idea, I call romper stomper.
[03:16.520 --> 03:16.920]  Okay.
[03:18.020 --> 03:19.120]  Australian movie style?
[03:19.280 --> 03:19.480]  Uh-huh.
[03:22.060 --> 03:22.940]  Put it right here.
[03:23.260 --> 03:24.200]  Make sure it's lined up.
[03:24.460 --> 03:25.360]  Sandwich, got it.
[03:26.060 --> 03:27.900]  Honestly, size-wise, I could go this way.
[03:28.300 --> 03:29.060]  Might go a little long.
[03:29.640 --> 03:30.160]  That's fine.
[03:30.400 --> 03:30.700]  Yeah, right?
[03:30.740 --> 03:31.300]  I think that's fine.
[03:31.500 --> 03:31.700]  Okay.
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.780]  So, we know the size of the sandwich is this.
[03:36.480 --> 03:39.640]  I'm gonna make it, like, paper-thin.
[03:40.360 --> 03:41.140]  This looks terrible.
[03:44.860 --> 03:45.460]  Awful.
[03:45.580 --> 03:45.860]  Okay.
[03:46.880 --> 03:47.720]  Here's my first attempt.
[03:48.400 --> 03:49.480]  It's called romper stomper.
[03:53.980 --> 03:56.040]  Oh my god.
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.500]  From my point of view, it vanished.
[04:08.050 --> 04:10.350]  And it shot out some of the tomato.
[04:10.630 --> 04:12.050]  You got some tomato on the floor here.
[04:12.050 --> 04:14.010]  Okay, so we can have our first look.
[04:17.470 --> 04:19.370]  Had a little bit of a blowout.
[04:19.810 --> 04:20.970]  And it came out of water.
[04:21.730 --> 04:22.670]  Oh no.
[04:23.170 --> 04:27.310]  That's not really a sandwich, though, anymore.
[04:27.990 --> 04:28.930]  That's pretty thin.
[04:30.070 --> 04:31.110]  I don't...
[04:31.110 --> 04:31.530]  I don't...
[04:34.290 --> 04:36.510]  I might have to fold it over again.
[04:36.510 --> 04:37.370]  Oh, and then re-stomp it?
[04:37.370 --> 04:38.010]  And for my...
[04:38.010 --> 04:39.770]  I mean, I could definitely...
[04:39.770 --> 04:41.810]  If you guys will allow me to romper stomp one more time.
[04:41.850 --> 04:42.390]  You can...
[04:42.390 --> 04:43.810]  You declare when you're done stomping.
[04:44.890 --> 04:46.710]  Let me give it one more romper stomp, Jeff.
[04:46.990 --> 04:47.410]  How's that sound?
[04:47.410 --> 04:48.030]  Go for it.
[04:48.030 --> 04:48.550]  Yeah? Alright.
[04:49.110 --> 04:52.370]  Again, thanks, Blaine, for giving me the wood.
[04:53.750 --> 04:54.530]  Romper stomper.
[04:58.110 --> 05:00.670]  He couldn't go through the floor.
[05:00.890 --> 05:01.530]  Oh my god.
[05:01.850 --> 05:02.550]  He burnt the wood.
[05:02.610 --> 05:03.290]  The wood burnt.
[05:04.430 --> 05:05.230]  Oh no!
[05:05.230 --> 05:06.710]  That's a...
[05:07.850 --> 05:09.570]  I think I'm done with romper stomper.
[05:09.890 --> 05:12.250]  I think your shoe touched the sandwich.
[05:13.850 --> 05:14.570]  Oh dear.
[05:14.790 --> 05:15.550]  It's pretty flat.
[05:16.010 --> 05:17.350]  So far, this is pretty flat.
[05:17.550 --> 05:20.370]  I think, though, with my second attempt, I think I can make it flatter.
[05:20.710 --> 05:21.530]  Destroy flat.
[05:21.630 --> 05:22.130]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:22.210 --> 05:23.090]  I think I can make it flatter.
[05:23.270 --> 05:23.830]  You gonna do it again?
[05:24.870 --> 05:27.750]  I think you guys should go on your first attempt, and then I can...
[05:27.750 --> 05:28.490]  I'll do my second.
[05:28.950 --> 05:29.150]  Okay.
[05:30.150 --> 05:31.470]  Gabby or me go?
[05:31.570 --> 05:32.130]  I think you should go.
[05:33.590 --> 05:34.550]  I gotta be honest with you.
[05:34.550 --> 05:36.610]  I came in with no plan on how to do any of this.
[05:36.870 --> 05:37.170]  No plan?
[05:37.970 --> 05:42.670]  But I've been emboldened and impressed with Eric's work.
[05:42.870 --> 05:43.370]  Thank you.
[05:44.070 --> 05:45.430]  It's given me an idea.
[05:45.710 --> 05:46.450]  Oh shit.
[05:47.070 --> 05:50.010]  This was just to hang curtains today, but since we're here...
[05:50.010 --> 05:51.270]  We're gonna break the house.
[05:51.750 --> 05:53.050]  You're gonna break this thing.
[05:53.550 --> 05:54.290]  How does this work?
[05:55.430 --> 05:56.090]  What do you want?
[05:56.370 --> 05:56.770]  Oh yeah.
[05:57.650 --> 05:58.690]  How do I slide it?
[05:59.010 --> 05:59.250]  Oh.
[05:59.510 --> 06:00.090]  Let me undo it.
[06:00.290 --> 06:00.470]  Okay.
[06:00.690 --> 06:02.030]  Yeah, you're gonna de-hinge this.
[06:02.070 --> 06:02.670]  This is great.
[06:02.670 --> 06:03.930]  Oh, there's some gunk left.
[06:05.010 --> 06:05.370]  There you go.
[06:06.390 --> 06:06.730]  Okay.
[06:07.730 --> 06:08.490]  Oh, ew.
[06:08.570 --> 06:08.730]  Hang on.
[06:09.090 --> 06:10.050]  Do you want me to lock it back in?
[06:10.250 --> 06:11.630]  No, that's not a good idea.
[06:11.710 --> 06:11.990]  Are you sure?
[06:12.530 --> 06:13.250]  I'm sure.
[06:14.110 --> 06:14.590]  Okay.
[06:15.470 --> 06:17.310]  I feel like I'm about to film someone die.
[06:19.430 --> 06:20.150]  You ready?
[06:21.450 --> 06:22.610]  On your mark.
[06:22.750 --> 06:24.350]  Let that clock get set.
[06:26.270 --> 06:33.030]  Oh, you did de-hinge it.
[06:42.250 --> 06:43.290]  Oh my God.
[06:43.290 --> 06:45.930]  The worst part is, your sandwich isn't even flat.
[06:46.410 --> 06:47.390]  It's pretty flat.
[06:48.370 --> 06:49.930]  It's still a sandwich at least.
[06:50.470 --> 06:52.110]  Dan, you popped three hinges.
[06:53.370 --> 06:54.150]  That's fine.
[06:54.250 --> 06:54.670]  It's fine!
[06:55.130 --> 06:55.590]  It's fine.
[06:56.130 --> 06:56.650]  You built that.
[06:56.870 --> 06:58.630]  I did, I'm not building another one.
[06:58.850 --> 07:00.310]  No, see, look how neat.
[07:00.390 --> 07:00.970]  This is perfect.
[07:01.510 --> 07:02.630]  That's not perfect.
[07:03.070 --> 07:03.630]  Yeah, there we go.
[07:04.230 --> 07:06.030]  He fucked up my table in there, it's fine.
[07:07.550 --> 07:08.970]  Alright, that's my first attempt.
[07:09.350 --> 07:11.250]  Not nearly as fun as Eric's, but...
[07:11.250 --> 07:12.270]  You got second place so far.
[07:12.370 --> 07:13.150]  I'm happy with it.
[07:14.150 --> 07:15.030]  Eric? Uh, Gavin?
[07:15.830 --> 07:17.130]  Oh, that's your whole attempt?
[07:17.670 --> 07:17.930]  Yeah.
[07:18.130 --> 07:18.410]  Oh, okay.
[07:19.450 --> 07:20.690]  Eric broke the fucking table.
[07:22.810 --> 07:23.650]  Uh... alright.
[07:24.930 --> 07:27.610]  I'm going to strategically go outside for mine.
[07:27.870 --> 07:28.170]  Oh!
[07:28.450 --> 07:28.830]  Oh, okay.
[07:29.130 --> 07:32.390]  This is exactly what I was gonna do for my next go.
[07:32.390 --> 07:34.670]  I need a piece of cardboard from my office.
[07:36.650 --> 07:37.930]  Mine and Nick's office.
[07:38.390 --> 07:39.350]  I'm allowed to go in?
[07:39.450 --> 07:39.630]  Yeah.
[07:40.030 --> 07:42.810]  My balls hurt so fucking bad from doing Romper Stomper.
[07:43.030 --> 07:43.430]  Did they really?
[07:43.670 --> 07:44.070]  Oh my god.
[07:44.070 --> 07:44.950]  Your balls look pretty good.
[07:45.110 --> 07:45.810]  Did you rack yourself?
[07:46.050 --> 07:47.470]  Dude, I just like...
[07:47.470 --> 07:49.570]  When I jumped, I think it just came down so hard
[07:49.570 --> 07:51.350]  and my legs squeezed, and it was like...
[07:51.350 --> 07:51.830]  It was brutal.
[07:52.350 --> 07:54.210]  I want to make sure it's perfectly flat,
[07:54.350 --> 07:55.510]  because yours did like a smear.
[07:55.510 --> 07:56.510]  It did, it smeared.
[07:56.570 --> 07:58.610]  So I want to make sure mine is exactly like that.
[07:58.750 --> 07:58.930]  Yep.
[07:59.210 --> 08:00.190]  You're gonna have to drive the car.
[08:00.930 --> 08:01.510]  Oh, okay.
[08:01.510 --> 08:02.610]  Well, I...
[08:04.570 --> 08:06.050]  I mean, it's not like he can do it.
[08:10.880 --> 08:11.560]  This is good.
[08:12.020 --> 08:14.300]  So I was gonna do this, and I was gonna call it the drive-by.
[08:14.820 --> 08:15.540]  The drive-by?
[08:15.660 --> 08:15.880]  Yeah.
[08:16.680 --> 08:17.880]  Felt good about the drive-by.
[08:18.700 --> 08:19.040]  Alright.
[08:19.720 --> 08:21.220]  Alright, I think that's a good position.
[08:21.740 --> 08:22.100]  Alright.
[08:24.780 --> 08:26.140]  Keep coming, keep coming.
[08:26.620 --> 08:27.340]  Keep coming.
[08:27.800 --> 08:28.280]  Keep coming.
[08:28.640 --> 08:29.360]  Keep coming.
[08:29.540 --> 08:30.360]  Oh, right there.
[08:31.320 --> 08:31.880]  Okay, back it up.
[08:31.880 --> 08:33.360]  Can you tell him to back it up and just hold?
[08:33.860 --> 08:34.400]  Hold, hold.
[08:34.580 --> 08:34.800]  Hold.
[08:35.640 --> 08:36.360]  Now what do you want?
[08:36.500 --> 08:38.180]  Now get Jeff to jump up and down.
[08:38.400 --> 08:39.880]  Jeff, can you jump up and down?
[08:40.620 --> 08:41.220]  He's doing it.
[08:42.840 --> 08:43.960]  Okay, back it up.
[08:44.000 --> 08:45.420]  Dude, look at these tire marks.
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.960]  Alright, let's do the reveal inside.
[08:52.340 --> 08:52.840]  Oh, okay.
[08:53.320 --> 08:54.160]  Oh, wait, it feels flat.
[09:00.400 --> 09:01.420]  Alright, Jeff, get around there.
[09:02.400 --> 09:04.740]  Alright, so this is a post car.
[09:06.460 --> 09:06.860]  Wow.
[09:07.340 --> 09:08.120]  Oh, it had a blowout.
[09:08.180 --> 09:09.400]  It had a blowout at the side.
[09:09.580 --> 09:10.180]  That's unfortunate.
[09:10.700 --> 09:12.500]  But, I mean, maybe that was the jumping.
[09:12.700 --> 09:12.800]  Yeah.
[09:14.380 --> 09:18.420]  Ooh, it might be too flat to even extract.
[09:19.220 --> 09:19.440]  Okay.
[09:20.120 --> 09:20.380]  Okay.
[09:20.580 --> 09:20.760]  Gavin?
[09:21.080 --> 09:22.200]  No, that's...
[09:22.200 --> 09:22.880]  Hey, you know what?
[09:23.260 --> 09:24.720]  I don't even think we need a second attempt, dude.
[09:24.760 --> 09:26.060]  I think Gavin won.
[09:26.260 --> 09:27.660]  I don't know how you beat that.
[09:27.800 --> 09:28.060]  Gavin?
[09:28.060 --> 09:30.060]  I think...
[09:30.820 --> 09:32.540]  Gavin, that's the flattest sandwich I've ever seen.
[09:32.620 --> 09:35.000]  Gavin, that's flatter than the funny video on TikTok.
[09:35.020 --> 09:36.060]  Yeah, dude, take a bite.
[09:36.180 --> 09:36.660]  That's the flattest sandwich on TikTok.
[09:36.660 --> 09:37.980]  Take a victory bite.
[09:38.200 --> 09:40.380]  And I think the carb will protect it against the blowout.
[09:40.520 --> 09:40.640]  Yeah.
[09:40.820 --> 09:44.200]  Let's get Eric over here and let's all take a bite together.
[09:44.260 --> 09:44.940]  Ooh, that's fun.
[09:45.080 --> 09:46.340]  Can we put on a tripod or something?
[09:47.160 --> 09:47.520]  Okay.
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.700]  Okay, well, I gotta say, Jeff's looks like a regular sandwich.
[09:53.180 --> 09:53.340]  Yeah.
[09:53.500 --> 09:54.460]  Mine looks like a mess.
[09:54.760 --> 09:56.280]  Gavin, congratulations on that one.
[09:56.420 --> 09:56.820]  Congratulations.
[09:56.820 --> 09:57.700]  Hey, cheers.
[09:57.820 --> 09:58.200]  Hey, boys.
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.420]  Gold, silver.
[09:59.740 --> 09:59.920]  Yep.
[10:00.100 --> 10:00.340]  Cheers.
[10:03.300 --> 10:03.740]  Mmm.
[10:04.840 --> 10:06.380]  This might be the new way to eat sandwiches.
[10:06.620 --> 10:07.800]  That's a perfectly good sandwich.
[10:07.900 --> 10:08.200]  Mm-hmm.
[10:08.520 --> 10:09.440]  I'm eating all of that.
[10:12.280 --> 10:12.720]  Well...
[10:12.720 --> 10:14.020]  Thanks for watching.
[10:14.220 --> 10:14.980]  Now it's just a muffin.
[10:15.240 --> 10:15.540]  Mm-hmm.
[10:16.480 --> 10:18.040]  How should we have flattened the sandwich?
[10:18.180 --> 10:19.700]  What would you have done to flatten the sandwich?
[10:20.240 --> 10:21.360]  Oh, that's a good question.
[10:21.520 --> 10:22.400]  Mm-hmm.
[10:22.660 --> 10:23.920]  That's engagement, bitch.
[10:23.920 --> 10:26.200]  Leave a comment.
[10:26.580 --> 10:27.620]  Let a friend know.
[10:29.580 --> 10:31.400]  What would Mark the Frog do to flatten the sandwich?
[10:35.180 --> 10:37.660]  Mark the Frog doesn't understand what we just did.
[10:40.800 --> 10:41.680]  All right.
[10:42.040 --> 10:44.060]  Go to patreon.com slash regulation club.
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.040]  We'll see you next time.
[10:45.080 --> 10:45.360]  Bye.
[10:45.580 --> 10:45.780]  Bye.
[10:47.520 --> 10:48.420]  Hey, Andrew.
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.640]  Are you gonna dispose?
[10:52.040 --> 10:52.380]  Andrew?
[10:54.100 --> 10:55.080]  Howl if you can hear us.
[10:55.860 --> 10:56.220]  Okay.
[10:56.420 --> 10:56.780]  All right.
[10:57.400 --> 10:57.840]  You heard us.
[10:58.100 --> 10:58.680]  All right, here we go.
[10:59.240 --> 10:59.660]  Hey, Gavin.
[11:00.340 --> 11:01.180]  Off with the spread.
[11:03.700 --> 11:04.920]  Were you rolling?
[11:05.460 --> 11:05.640]  Yeah.
[11:05.680 --> 11:07.040]  Did you get a really good one?
[11:07.540 --> 11:08.240]  How's the shot look?
[11:08.300 --> 11:08.600]  Is it fine?
[11:09.200 --> 11:09.900]  I can see everything.
[11:12.780 --> 11:13.980]  I'm in the corner.
[11:15.520 --> 11:18.840]  Andrew said that he wanted to participate in the sandwich smash also.
[11:19.140 --> 11:22.080]  So he bought the guillotine from Jackass Forever.
[11:24.400 --> 11:27.160]  What was once on Steve-O's shins will now be on the sandwich.
[11:27.360 --> 11:29.360]  Smash Steve-O's shins when he was at Mark.
[11:30.020 --> 11:30.900]  Andrew, are you ready?
[11:37.000 --> 11:37.400]  Whoa.
[11:40.220 --> 11:41.540]  Poor Steve-O, man.
[11:42.620 --> 11:46.080]  Is that why in the movie he went, ah!
[11:47.800 --> 11:48.160]  Damn.
[11:48.460 --> 11:49.260]  That's no joke.
[11:49.280 --> 11:49.780]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.260]  Pull it up from the rope.
[11:51.540 --> 11:52.040]  Oh, yeah, the rope.
[11:52.100 --> 11:52.500]  Rope it up.
[11:54.120 --> 11:54.440]  Wow.
[11:55.040 --> 11:55.680]  Wow, Andrew.
[11:55.800 --> 11:56.340]  Nick, Nick.
[11:57.320 --> 11:57.780]  Unfurl it?
[11:57.900 --> 11:58.080]  Yeah.
[11:58.560 --> 11:59.080]  Let's see.
[12:00.000 --> 12:00.580]  Oh, shit.
[12:01.200 --> 12:02.860]  Okay, so it came out a little bit already.
[12:03.520 --> 12:04.420]  Ooh, you know what?
[12:04.520 --> 12:04.900]  You know what?
[12:05.760 --> 12:06.580]  It's pretty flat.
[12:06.780 --> 12:07.900]  It's giving me a run for my money.
[12:08.060 --> 12:09.840]  Hey, Nick, take a bite and let us know how flat it is.
[12:09.880 --> 12:10.340]  All right, let's see.
[12:12.260 --> 12:12.900]  So flat.
[12:21.580 --> 12:22.820]  Hey, Nick, watch your hands.
[12:27.560 --> 12:29.140]  All right, he's eating it, too.
[12:29.800 --> 12:30.380]  Well done, Andrew.
[12:34.840 --> 12:36.480]  It also blew the tomatoes out.
[12:36.560 --> 12:37.280]  It didn't take them out.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.320]  He's gone crazy.
[12:38.340 --> 12:39.040]  Those are slippery tomatoes.
[12:39.060 --> 12:40.240]  Those are always the first out.
[12:40.800 --> 12:41.100]  All right.
[12:41.260 --> 12:42.320]  Those are the slipperiest devils.
[12:42.400 --> 12:43.360]  All right, thanks for watching.
[12:43.460 --> 12:43.580]  Bye.
[12:44.800 --> 12:45.440]  Jesus Christ.
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.460]  I didn't mean to do that.
