[00:00.640 --> 00:03.760]  Hello and welcome to a regulation auction.
[00:04.100 --> 00:08.440]  I am here signed into my personal account for Prop Store.
[00:08.600 --> 00:13.040]  As you saw in the other video, we did some scouting and I am trying to secure
[00:13.700 --> 00:14.480]  a special lot.
[00:14.540 --> 00:15.540]  What's currently going on right now?
[00:15.580 --> 00:16.940]  Close encounters of the third kind.
[00:18.620 --> 00:21.040]  Douglas Trumbull Collection, I don't know who that is.
[00:21.400 --> 00:22.380]  I haven't seen that movie,
[00:22.880 --> 00:26.220]  but our lot is coming up that we are excited about.
[00:26.220 --> 00:27.460]  If you scroll down.
[00:28.560 --> 00:33.080]  13. What is it?
[00:33.360 --> 00:36.260]  1374, Rick Santoro's,
[00:36.400 --> 00:41.080]  aka Nicolas Cage, screen match bloodied costume from Snake Eyes 1998,
[00:41.480 --> 00:45.720]  as well as 1375, Rick Santoro's, Nicolas Cage's jewelry.
[00:46.340 --> 00:47.240]  Snake Eyes 1998.
[00:47.480 --> 00:48.520]  We're going back to 98.
[00:48.620 --> 00:49.760]  We've talked a lot about 98.
[00:50.400 --> 00:53.140]  Unfortunately, I'm the only one here with you.
[00:53.580 --> 00:54.840]  Everybody else is away.
[00:54.840 --> 00:56.000]  It's a Saturday.
[00:56.320 --> 00:57.440]  Not that that matters.
[00:57.660 --> 00:58.500]  Completely irrelevant.
[00:58.640 --> 01:01.580]  I know I said that as if that impacts why people aren't here.
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.840]  But we ain't going to stop.
[01:05.020 --> 01:09.380]  We got to get this exciting auction coverage of us getting snake eyes.
[01:09.800 --> 01:11.680]  I'm so excited. I'm terrified.
[01:12.180 --> 01:13.460]  We're signing on my personal account.
[01:13.560 --> 01:14.920]  I'm trying to secure it for the guys.
[01:15.180 --> 01:16.520]  I can surprise them.
[01:16.680 --> 01:18.020]  That was a burp. Couldn't stop it.
[01:18.100 --> 01:18.740]  Sorry about that.
[01:18.980 --> 01:22.560]  At a later date, we're still just going through this Douglas Trumbull Collection.
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.660]  Going piece by piece of the mothership landing site.
[01:29.060 --> 01:33.360]  Now, I currently have bids and I'm the top bidder and the only bidder
[01:33.360 --> 01:36.720]  for the Ricky Santoro full outfit.
[01:37.120 --> 01:40.760]  I had a little bit of a bidding war this afternoon over the jewelry.
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.200]  I want to get it all.
[01:42.320 --> 01:43.740]  You can't have one without the other.
[01:44.820 --> 01:49.440]  So hopefully that person who bid on the jewelry is done.
[01:50.560 --> 01:53.080]  And the outfit, I'm the only bidder.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.400]  I have it at the lowest price I could possibly get it.
[01:56.280 --> 01:57.180]  Hopefully that's the case.
[01:57.280 --> 01:58.880]  It'd be just amazing.
[01:59.140 --> 02:00.660]  You know, we had the tuxedo in the past.
[02:00.760 --> 02:01.880]  We lost it, unfortunately.
[02:03.600 --> 02:07.140]  So to have this as a replacement would be incredible.
[02:07.560 --> 02:11.440]  It's screen matched as well, which means that it is identified
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.980]  as being used in the film.
[02:14.100 --> 02:18.900]  It is 100% a thing that Nick Cage wore during Snake Eyes, which is crazy.
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.400]  But we're at lot 1361, 1362, we're flying through.
[02:25.300 --> 02:29.800]  I'm guessing Douglas Trumbull had something to do with the story,
[02:29.920 --> 02:32.920]  but or what the close encounters of the third kind, because it's all.
[02:34.080 --> 02:36.260]  Third kind stuff, current bid is 800,
[02:37.180 --> 02:40.340]  which is the minimum to get it.
[02:40.440 --> 02:43.000]  Now, what I didn't know when talking about this with Gavin after.
[02:44.120 --> 02:46.480]  I don't know if it was in the recording or after we recorded last,
[02:46.480 --> 02:50.580]  but there is a buyer's premium where it's like you have to pay 25%
[02:50.580 --> 02:51.800]  on whatever the bid is, so.
[02:52.960 --> 02:56.220]  That is a thing to be mindful of if you
[02:56.900 --> 02:59.520]  decide to try to do some of this auction stuff.
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.040]  I typically don't do this, but
[03:04.980 --> 03:10.040]  when you have an item like Nicholas Cage's fucking whole suit, whole set up.
[03:10.980 --> 03:14.200]  From Snake Eyes, you got to, if you can.
[03:15.340 --> 03:18.800]  Very lucky to be in a position in which I can attempt to get these things.
[03:21.180 --> 03:24.120]  Whoo, they're bidding 3,500.
[03:26.460 --> 03:28.620]  Our lots get close, we're like 10 away.
[03:29.140 --> 03:31.600]  It's going to move real quick, hopefully.
[03:32.620 --> 03:34.320]  Let's see what else is coming up, is it all.
[03:35.800 --> 03:37.640]  Close encounters of the third kind.
[03:39.040 --> 03:40.900]  Douglas Trumbull, Douglas Trumbull.
[03:40.900 --> 03:44.600]  Oh, Slick's Geoff Goldblum shirt from Silverado.
[03:45.740 --> 03:47.280]  Was Silverado a movie?
[03:47.780 --> 03:49.160]  Did they make it into a film?
[03:49.240 --> 03:51.960]  I know it was a TV show, at least I think it was a show,
[03:52.340 --> 03:55.620]  but I think it was a show in like the 50s or 40s.
[03:56.420 --> 03:57.980]  When were they doing all the Western shows?
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.200]  40s?
[04:02.080 --> 04:05.740]  50s, I think it's 50s, I guess, probably late 50s,
[04:05.780 --> 04:07.940]  actually into the 60s, I imagine.
[04:09.960 --> 04:12.940]  Anyway, there's some cool stuff in this lot.
[04:15.200 --> 04:20.020]  There is the Benji thing we looked at before, I decided as much as I like it
[04:20.020 --> 04:22.320]  just because of how ridiculous it is.
[04:22.600 --> 04:25.080]  It's not even in like a movie thing.
[04:25.500 --> 04:29.700]  I watched what it was from and I couldn't even identify the moment which
[04:29.700 --> 04:34.900]  they were there in that outfit or would be needed as a stand in for that.
[04:36.040 --> 04:37.480]  That was one of the things we saved.
[04:37.480 --> 04:44.280]  I don't, I know we looked at the turbo man stuff
[04:44.280 --> 04:47.780]  from Jingle all the way, the jet pack that was going up in price
[04:47.780 --> 04:49.480]  beyond what we'd want for it, unfortunately.
[04:50.420 --> 04:52.780]  I was really excited about the booster action figures.
[04:53.500 --> 04:57.540]  Those have gone up beyond the expectation and way more than I would ever feel
[04:57.540 --> 04:59.120]  comfortable paying for something like that.
[05:00.860 --> 05:05.640]  Eric, I know and hate it, but all that small soldiers thing was really cool.
[05:05.640 --> 05:09.040]  It was a I guess if you didn't look at the other content or maybe
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.720]  I don't know if it was in it or if that was something I saw later.
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.320]  There was a chip hazard.
[05:15.980 --> 05:20.380]  From small soldiers like exact replica of the action figure,
[05:21.020 --> 05:22.460]  and it's awesome.
[05:22.700 --> 05:23.960]  It wasn't part of the movie.
[05:24.360 --> 05:28.140]  They did like a special edition where they made 25 of them,
[05:28.180 --> 05:31.340]  and it was the same team that put it together for the film
[05:31.340 --> 05:32.720]  using the molds and everything.
[05:32.720 --> 05:37.060]  So it is as screen accurate as you could get without it
[05:37.060 --> 05:38.420]  actually being part of the film.
[05:38.720 --> 05:43.580]  And that thing is up to like $7,000 last time I checked, which is crazy.
[05:44.180 --> 05:46.800]  As much as I love small soldiers, it's.
[05:47.360 --> 05:51.380]  Way, way, way beyond any amount I would ever feel comfortable paying.
[05:53.140 --> 05:57.160]  But this Trumbull stuff is still moving on,
[05:57.160 --> 05:59.860]  and we're I want to say less than 10 away.
[06:00.440 --> 06:03.940]  I keep forgetting if it's 13, 74, 75.
[06:04.940 --> 06:06.920]  Either way, though, we're getting closer.
[06:08.160 --> 06:10.400]  Piece by piece, I mean, this is some pretty cool art.
[06:10.580 --> 06:11.720]  Let me click on this.
[06:11.820 --> 06:13.360]  Let me and I make it bigger.
[06:14.540 --> 06:15.780]  No, I can't.
[06:18.380 --> 06:21.100]  This is Caesars Universe Artworks.
[06:22.520 --> 06:24.260]  OK, so Robert McCall.
[06:26.760 --> 06:28.880]  Wait, Douglas Trumbull's collection.
[06:29.860 --> 06:33.080]  OK, so this is his collection of a hand painted thing by Robert McCall,
[06:33.160 --> 06:38.040]  who I also do not have a familiarity with, nor have I ever been to Caesars.
[06:39.280 --> 06:40.040]  That's cool.
[06:42.580 --> 06:43.860]  Dinosaurs and stuff.
[06:45.540 --> 06:47.340]  Very futuristic, they.
[06:49.140 --> 06:50.300]  I need to go back to you.
[06:50.360 --> 06:52.420]  Holy shit, we're already at 9,500.
[06:52.640 --> 06:57.920]  The expected range was 1,500 to 3,000 people really into this.
[06:57.920 --> 07:03.160]  This, I guess, is something that is more valuable or recognized than I realize.
[07:03.320 --> 07:04.780]  Actually, they might have a descriptor.
[07:06.420 --> 07:07.020]  Of.
[07:09.020 --> 07:13.260]  Bob McCall, Caesars Universe Project with Casablanca Records and Film.
[07:18.500 --> 07:21.800]  Visual effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull was born in L.A.
[07:21.800 --> 07:23.520]  in 1942 after abandoning.
[07:24.200 --> 07:26.540]  OK, well, just it just reset.
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.380]  After abandoning architecture for technical drawing and cartooning,
[07:32.400 --> 07:36.320]  his talent for photorealism soon earned him work at Graphic Films,
[07:36.380 --> 07:39.340]  an esteemed Hollywood studio for which he designed groundbreaking
[07:39.340 --> 07:43.840]  cosmic effects for the 1964 New York World's Fair.
[07:45.380 --> 07:48.600]  Oh, he worked with Kubrick after Kubrick saw his work,
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.920]  hired him to create animation of these VFX shots,
[07:52.020 --> 07:56.480]  including the iconic Stargate sequence, what would become his Zenit reset.
[07:56.480 --> 07:58.320]  That's we got all we need from that.
[07:58.380 --> 08:00.900]  We got to start focusing in because we got Silverado.
[08:01.540 --> 08:04.160]  Geoff Goldblum, 1985.
[08:05.760 --> 08:07.260]  Current bid 700.
[08:10.140 --> 08:11.800]  Slick is a great name.
[08:13.340 --> 08:14.600]  For a Geoff Goldblum character.
[08:16.240 --> 08:17.040]  That's fantastic.
[08:19.880 --> 08:23.980]  Oh, do the Bartman hand-painted animation cell with photocopy background.
[08:23.980 --> 08:27.400]  The Simpsons, Bart Simpson, do the Bartman.
[08:27.580 --> 08:31.040]  I loved the Simpsons soundtrack as a kid.
[08:31.240 --> 08:32.340]  Wasn't even really a soundtrack.
[08:32.520 --> 08:37.160]  It was like they released an album of original music or parody songs.
[08:37.200 --> 08:40.720]  I don't remember, but I would listen to that all the time.
[08:42.940 --> 08:47.780]  Hey, somebody hit the minimum bid, someone is buying do the Bartman at $800.
[08:48.960 --> 08:50.600]  Assuming no one else goes over.
[08:52.020 --> 08:54.880]  He's doing the whole fair warning is about the clothes, but.
[08:57.420 --> 09:00.540]  Now we got more Simpsons drawings for the show.
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.520]  There's part of me that wants to try to catch up and watch all the Simpsons again,
[09:07.560 --> 09:12.060]  but there's another part of me that is like, that's a lot of time
[09:12.060 --> 09:17.700]  for a thing that is by consensus, really not worth doing.
[09:18.800 --> 09:21.580]  I'm not that much of a Simpsons fan as much as like,
[09:21.580 --> 09:23.060]  like so many others.
[09:23.300 --> 09:25.200]  I love the first seasons, especially growing up.
[09:25.280 --> 09:28.940]  And then the video games that were around like hit run and road rage
[09:30.320 --> 09:31.360]  were fantastic.
[09:32.540 --> 09:35.580]  A lot of terrible Simpsons games as well, like skateboarding and wrestling.
[09:35.840 --> 09:37.100]  Actually, never played the skateboarding.
[09:37.140 --> 09:38.060]  I can't comment on that one.
[09:38.580 --> 09:41.040]  But since it's wrestling, absolute disaster.
[09:42.760 --> 09:45.940]  So I guess I navigated through the bad games
[09:45.940 --> 09:50.140]  and mainly just played hit and run and road rage,
[09:50.140 --> 09:52.000]  which were incredible at the time.
[09:53.260 --> 09:57.600]  Being a kid who is not old enough to play like GTA three
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.120]  when it came out, hit and run, which is what they heavily advertised it as,
[10:01.160 --> 10:04.440]  is like, hey, you teenager, you, you kid.
[10:05.520 --> 10:08.620]  This is GTA for kids with the Simpsons.
[10:08.780 --> 10:11.620]  It's going to say with sleepless in Seattle because this will popped up on the screen.
[10:12.180 --> 10:13.740]  Now, that would be a wild
[10:15.040 --> 10:15.480]  combination.
[10:15.800 --> 10:18.280]  We're taking the sleepless in Seattle IP
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.460]  and we're going to put it in a world filled with murder.
[10:24.080 --> 10:29.300]  Just. Insane crime, violence and explosions,
[10:29.300 --> 10:31.300]  because that's what that audience wants.
[10:32.980 --> 10:35.120]  Now we're in Sleepy Hollow from 1999.
[10:36.400 --> 10:38.360]  Is that the Johnny Depp one?
[10:40.540 --> 10:41.520]  He was in that, right?
[10:43.200 --> 10:45.160]  Yeah, Tim Burton, Sleepy Hollow, that was from 99.
[10:45.940 --> 10:46.920]  That's crazy.
[10:47.740 --> 10:50.060]  I would have guessed that movie came out like 2003.
[10:51.540 --> 10:52.780]  Anyway, we're getting closer.
[10:54.100 --> 10:55.160]  Home, get stressed.
[10:55.480 --> 10:57.080]  I'm getting real stressed. We're coming up on it.
[10:58.420 --> 10:58.920]  Oh, boy.
[11:00.380 --> 11:04.260]  Not a lot of interest on Sleepy Hollow concept artwork prints.
[11:04.480 --> 11:08.980]  See? Oh, man, that's so rude that they've done this.
[11:09.940 --> 11:12.200]  It's so rude that they've done this.
[11:13.240 --> 11:14.260]  Oh, man.
[11:14.260 --> 11:17.020]  OK, well, current bid 4000.
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.860]  It is the Small Soldiers limited edition Stan Winston studio box
[11:20.860 --> 11:22.480]  ship hazard toy replica.
[11:22.920 --> 11:24.440]  It is the thing I talked about.
[11:24.740 --> 11:27.280]  It is at 4500. That is.
[11:28.980 --> 11:31.500]  4000 is like, oh, my God, that's so much.
[11:31.560 --> 11:35.780]  And then on top of the buyer's premium, we're over 6000 on this thing.
[11:36.460 --> 11:37.260]  That's too much.
[11:38.280 --> 11:39.300]  Since I do not.
[11:40.300 --> 11:44.700]  That is beyond any range I will ever have to be able to spend
[11:45.520 --> 11:49.320]  that much on a chip hazard, as cool as that is, I'm just going to appreciate it.
[11:49.580 --> 11:51.520]  And these final moments looking at that photo.
[11:52.660 --> 11:53.680]  Oh, it's so awesome.
[11:56.060 --> 11:59.820]  They released a bunch of action figures in stores,
[11:59.840 --> 12:03.260]  and I had some of them as a kid, I gave away a lot of that stuff when I grew up,
[12:04.660 --> 12:07.760]  which is like that was the right move because I'm not going to play with them
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.340]  all that much.
[12:08.420 --> 12:11.560]  I hope they went to other kids that got a lot of joy out of them.
[12:11.900 --> 12:13.540]  Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[12:14.560 --> 12:15.220]  This is us.
[12:16.720 --> 12:17.460]  This is us.
[12:17.500 --> 12:19.200]  We got the top bid right now, we're the current.
[12:19.320 --> 12:20.520]  We're the highest bidder.
[12:20.600 --> 12:24.440]  Snake Eyes, Rick Santoros, Nicolas Cage, Scream Match, Bloody Costume.
[12:25.280 --> 12:25.860]  Come on, buddy.
[12:26.380 --> 12:28.300]  Come on, wrap this auction up, buddy.
[12:28.680 --> 12:29.620]  We're the highest bidder.
[12:29.880 --> 12:30.500]  Nobody come in.
[12:31.380 --> 12:32.040]  Nobody come in.
[12:33.020 --> 12:33.740]  Nobody come in.
[12:35.060 --> 12:36.040]  He's holding his gavel.
[12:36.100 --> 12:36.740]  He's just talking.
[12:36.740 --> 12:37.680]  He's talking.
[12:38.600 --> 12:41.160]  Oh, I want him in frame, but I'm also terrified that if I go,
[12:41.380 --> 12:42.180]  someone will come in.
[12:42.780 --> 12:43.380]  Lock it up, buddy.
[12:43.800 --> 12:44.860]  Come on, come on, come on.
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.400]  Why are you still talking?
[12:47.400 --> 12:49.240]  Come on. No, I bid, I bid.
[12:49.440 --> 12:51.840]  Fuck, fuck. OK, we're going in.
[12:52.820 --> 12:53.100]  Shit.
[12:54.880 --> 12:55.240]  Shit.
[12:56.380 --> 12:57.360]  This is terrifying.
[12:58.920 --> 13:00.020]  OK, we're in a bidding war.
[13:00.120 --> 13:01.740]  I've never been in a live bidding war.
[13:03.040 --> 13:03.700]  Wrap it up.
[13:06.160 --> 13:07.100]  Wrap it up.
[13:08.680 --> 13:10.360]  Fair warning, this lot is about to close.
[13:12.640 --> 13:13.980]  Yeah, we got it.
[13:14.260 --> 13:15.420]  We got the Snake Eyes thing.
[13:15.500 --> 13:16.740]  OK, now we're on the jewelry.
[13:18.420 --> 13:19.920]  OK, we're the highest bidder.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.020]  Current bid. OK, I'm going to bid on this.
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.080]  I keep clicking the wrong thing.
[13:27.340 --> 13:28.420]  This is his jewelry.
[13:30.460 --> 13:32.900]  Now, we had other things that we could buy.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.960]  That went to about a thousand.
[13:35.660 --> 13:36.980]  We're at five hundred.
[13:37.960 --> 13:38.560]  How much is that?
[13:38.680 --> 13:40.740]  OK, we're going to I'm going to have a limit soon.
[13:48.840 --> 13:49.200]  Fuck.
[13:51.260 --> 13:51.620]  Fuck.
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.180]  OK, this is if they go to 2000, we're going to lose it.
[14:00.320 --> 14:00.680]  Fuck.
[14:02.260 --> 14:03.420]  I wish the guys were here.
[14:03.480 --> 14:03.960]  What do I do?
[14:05.680 --> 14:06.500]  What do I do?
[14:08.460 --> 14:09.260]  What do I do?
[14:09.380 --> 14:10.900]  We're at two thousand eight hundred thirty five.
[14:10.980 --> 14:11.880]  How much was the last thing?
[14:12.340 --> 14:13.340]  Two thousand five hundred.
[14:13.460 --> 14:15.240]  They've really we're going back.
[14:15.280 --> 14:16.620]  Who's this son of a bitch?
[14:19.780 --> 14:21.000]  OK, we're done, we're done.
[14:21.140 --> 14:21.620]  This is it.
[14:22.560 --> 14:23.580]  We can't go more than this.
[14:25.360 --> 14:26.320]  It's higher than I would want,
[14:26.380 --> 14:28.240]  but this is a once in a lifetime thing.
[14:30.040 --> 14:30.700]  This is it.
[14:31.620 --> 14:32.460]  Are we going to get it?
[14:36.200 --> 14:37.100]  Come on, lock it up.
[14:38.360 --> 14:38.840]  Yeah.
[14:41.380 --> 14:42.340]  Oh, OK.
[14:42.560 --> 14:43.600]  Well, that was more.
[14:44.880 --> 14:47.940]  That was more than any of us discussed paying for it.
[14:48.680 --> 14:50.660]  Oh, boy, it'll be.
[14:50.800 --> 14:51.420]  That's fine.
[14:51.700 --> 14:52.440]  That's exciting.
[14:52.720 --> 14:53.640]  Listen, we got the thing.
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.200]  I got it for the guys.
[14:55.260 --> 14:55.960]  I secured it.
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.640]  Wow, I can't.
[15:01.680 --> 15:03.100]  Oh, I can't believe that.
[15:03.160 --> 15:03.740]  That's crazy.
[15:04.640 --> 15:06.120]  Get the fuck out of here, Jesse Eisenberg.
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.000]  Respectfully, man, I'm sweating.
[15:10.080 --> 15:11.860]  I am. I can't.
[15:12.260 --> 15:13.940]  I'm never doing this again by myself.
[15:14.520 --> 15:17.180]  I need other people here for support if we're doing this.
[15:17.740 --> 15:19.400]  I am sweating right now.
[15:19.920 --> 15:21.360]  I that was terrible.
[15:22.160 --> 15:24.360]  That was so stressful, but we got it.
[15:24.380 --> 15:25.380]  We got everything we needed.
[15:25.580 --> 15:26.380]  We got the suit.
[15:26.420 --> 15:27.220]  We got the rings.
[15:28.140 --> 15:29.640]  I'm excited to see Eric.
[15:30.080 --> 15:33.160]  The fact that we looked at buying a few other items
[15:33.160 --> 15:36.700]  makes me feel comfortable that we went over because this was our number one
[15:36.700 --> 15:37.920]  by far.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.460]  You know, Jesus Christ.
[15:43.020 --> 15:44.060]  That was crazy.
[15:45.160 --> 15:46.100]  I need to lay down.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.420]  Thank you so much for watching.
[15:48.520 --> 15:49.320]  I hope you enjoy this.
[15:49.400 --> 15:53.400]  I hope you enjoy the stuff we have planned with the suit.
[15:53.660 --> 15:54.880]  We have a new suit in our life.
[15:54.900 --> 15:59.720]  We have a new it's not a tuxedo, but we got a fucking Nick Cage worn thing,
[16:00.220 --> 16:02.880]  which is awesome for a ridiculous movie.
[16:03.340 --> 16:04.480]  We got the rings.
[16:05.040 --> 16:05.940]  It's so cool.
[16:06.980 --> 16:08.160]  Thank you so much for watching.
[16:08.260 --> 16:09.120]  I hope this is entertaining.
[16:09.260 --> 16:10.900]  I apologize that I was by myself.
[16:11.580 --> 16:12.620]  I did my best.
[16:14.040 --> 16:16.820]  I hope maybe there will be a recording.
[16:17.060 --> 16:18.980]  I wish you guys yell at me for going a little bit over.
[16:19.240 --> 16:19.660]  Who knows?
[16:20.700 --> 16:21.600]  I don't think so.
[16:21.720 --> 16:23.120]  I think we're all just going to be really excited.
[16:23.220 --> 16:23.800]  I know I am.
[16:24.360 --> 16:28.120]  This is another thing we talked about, actually, before I wrap up this Soprano
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.080]  shirt, because I feel like I've seen Tony Soprano wear this thing a million times.
[16:32.120 --> 16:32.680]  But look at that.
[16:32.680 --> 16:34.100]  It's already four thousand five hundred.
[16:34.380 --> 16:36.060]  This is going to get so high, I think.
[16:38.840 --> 16:44.060]  And as I would much rather have the full setup for Snake Eyes
[16:44.640 --> 16:48.580]  than just the shirt of Tony Soprano is amazing as it is.
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.380]  But they projected this to be a thousand five hundred to three thousand of value.
[16:54.300 --> 16:56.460]  Current bid is six thousand five hundred.
[16:59.690 --> 17:00.270]  Oh, man.
[17:01.730 --> 17:02.750]  I am lightheaded.
[17:04.150 --> 17:06.330]  I didn't even record this in the discord call.
[17:06.630 --> 17:07.590]  I'm Jesus Christ.
[17:07.730 --> 17:08.610]  I'm just coming to you.
[17:08.790 --> 17:09.890]  Anyway, I'm sorry.
[17:10.310 --> 17:11.090]  We're extending this.
[17:11.190 --> 17:12.770]  Let's just see how much this goes.
[17:13.170 --> 17:14.570]  Looks like it'll be six thousand five hundred.
[17:16.110 --> 17:17.290]  Oh, went up to seven thousand.
[17:20.860 --> 17:21.500]  Is this it?
[17:23.260 --> 17:25.300]  These people are sweating, I imagine.
[17:26.720 --> 17:28.820]  I couldn't imagine being live for this.
[17:30.620 --> 17:31.400]  I could never.
[17:31.880 --> 17:34.220]  Oh, the last second they come in, there's another bid.
[17:35.720 --> 17:36.780]  Oh, boy.
[17:38.400 --> 17:42.580]  I think there's a world in which someone could get addicted to doing this,
[17:42.700 --> 17:44.440]  and I'm glad that's not me.
[17:44.940 --> 17:47.500]  I'm glad I do not find joy in this chase.
[17:48.120 --> 17:52.660]  Even just watching other people have these last seconds go back and forth
[17:53.940 --> 17:55.220]  interactions terrifies me.
[17:55.340 --> 17:55.960]  But that's that.
[17:56.380 --> 17:57.060]  We wrapped it up.
[17:57.400 --> 17:58.620]  Thank you so much for watching.
[17:59.180 --> 18:02.880]  Make sure you check out our Patreon at the regulation
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.320]  regulation podcast or Regulatrion.com.
[18:06.700 --> 18:10.660]  We got a Let's Play channel, which is, I think, the regulation pod.
[18:10.940 --> 18:14.340]  Or we have and we have got a Let's Play channel.
[18:14.420 --> 18:15.560]  We got a podcast channel on YouTube.

[18:20.920 --> 18:23.920]  I hope you have a wonderful day and I hope you keep track.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.740]  What we got planned for the snake eye stuff.
[18:27.740 --> 18:29.640]  Have a great day. Bye.
