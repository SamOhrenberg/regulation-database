[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  All right, the unveiling, the first ever regulation gerbler. Here it comes.
[00:11.380 --> 00:16.940]  So this is something we had to iterate on a lot, this kind of like smoky black whatever. We got a
[00:16.940 --> 00:22.020]  lot of tests done where it was not up to snuff and we said back to the drawing board. And then
[00:22.020 --> 00:26.000]  they said, great, how about this? But that is indeed a transparent black. Look at that.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.740]  Look at that. Beautiful. With the logo. Gorgeous. It looks great. It's a classic gerbler
[00:33.480 --> 00:39.420]  with the logo. We own the rights. Yeah, we can do that. We're legally allowed to do this.
[00:39.580 --> 00:43.160]  This dog got too excited. That might be water. He got too excited. No way. That's piss. That's
[00:43.160 --> 00:47.440]  piss from piss dogs. No, no, that's water. He's going to be dripping water for an hour.
[00:47.880 --> 00:52.260]  The dog saw the gerbler pissing. It collects in his neck and then it just drips forever.
[00:52.260 --> 00:59.200]  So we have the new gerbler. I'm showing it off influencer style. It's so pretty. Yeah,
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.540]  it's really great. Smoky gray. Yeah, it looks really great. Regulation gerbler color.
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.260]  How are we doing what we're about to do? Oh, right. That's not the point of this video. It
[01:10.260 --> 01:16.280]  is nice to show it off. But we had a discussion a while back about creating a subset of the
[01:16.280 --> 01:21.020]  gerbler called the throat goat, I believe. Yeah. That was like a gerbler, but it listed our throat
[01:21.020 --> 01:25.800]  sizes, our mouth sizes. And so we need to determine our mouth sizes. Obviously, Andrew will
[01:25.800 --> 01:31.380]  have to do his remotely. We thought the best way to determine our mouth sizes would be with
[01:31.380 --> 01:37.740]  gerblers. And that's how far we got. And then we said, we'll figure that next part out in the video.
[01:38.320 --> 01:44.840]  My concern is that we're about to slug a bunch of drinks and then spit them into the one and only
[01:44.840 --> 01:52.880]  cup that we have. Yeah. So we have an old gerbler. Right. Is that what we want to use? Maybe we'll
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.800]  use this as our, yeah. And maybe we'll spit in gerbler. And we'll mark that one. Yeah, we can
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.540]  mark this one. But we can also gauze into this for science. Oh. And then decant into the gerbler.
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.860]  So we have an exact measurement. Oh, yeah, we can do that. This is going to be gross. Yeah,
[02:07.880 --> 02:10.940]  it's going to be pretty gross. Well, don't drink it. I need like a sharpie or something. Yes,
[02:10.940 --> 02:17.680]  yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a sharpie? I don't know if we're going to be able, if Andrew does
[02:17.680 --> 02:22.600]  this test remotely. I don't trust him. He might, he's going to have an amount that's like double
[02:22.600 --> 02:27.920]  ours. Oh, I have the, I have the world's longest back and the world's biggest mouth capacity.
[02:28.120 --> 02:33.340]  I still, I still water in my back like a camel. Yeah, exactly. This is a permanent marker. So
[02:33.340 --> 02:40.920]  we're going to have to sacrifice. It's your gerbler. Yeah. It's a one of one now. It's
[02:40.920 --> 02:47.420]  one of one. So say Geoff goes first, fills his mouth, spits it into the Pyrex.
[02:48.320 --> 02:57.800]  Then he pours the Pyrex of his throat water into the green gerbler and then marks the line
[02:57.800 --> 03:04.250]  after it settles. Then we dump that liquid into the sink or into a bag and sell it.
[03:05.910 --> 03:11.370]  And, uh, then the next person goes and we all mark, here's what's going to happen. It's going
[03:11.370 --> 03:20.370]  to be four marks, probably this about. Yeah, probably be horizontal. I would think so.
[03:20.830 --> 03:25.770]  I would think so. Here's what we do. We go to my old house at 3 a.m. We dig up some dirt.
[03:26.010 --> 03:32.410]  They don't know. Okay. We come back, we spit the, our gerb sludge into little bits of dirt.
[03:32.410 --> 03:38.770]  Great idea. Have you seen, have you seen the woman that started digging her house, found the rug,
[03:39.070 --> 03:44.150]  called the cops? Have you seen this? No. She started digging to build a fence and then hit
[03:44.150 --> 03:49.550]  a rug. And then it was like, oh, this is crazy. And then posted on TikTok, like I hit this rug
[03:49.550 --> 03:54.270]  under my yard. And then people are like, Hey, you should probably call the police,
[03:54.650 --> 03:57.790]  called the cops. They came out and looked and they're like, we want to investigate this.
[03:57.830 --> 04:01.250]  We don't have the resources. So they left and they're like, she's like, okay, I'm gonna have
[04:01.250 --> 04:05.610]  friends come over and we're going to dig this up. And people made so much noise about it on TikTok
[04:05.610 --> 04:10.750]  that homicide came out with two dogs, dog one sat by the hole. And then they're like, well,
[04:10.790 --> 04:15.350]  give me, I get this dog out of here. Dog two sat by the hole. They are excavating it now. It's like,
[04:15.390 --> 04:23.750]  it's a body. Thinking about this all while we were like, I'm watching these videos and I'm like,
[04:24.110 --> 04:29.050]  could have been us. There's, we were in your backyard with a jackhammer could have been us.
[04:31.630 --> 04:36.770]  Speaking of holes in the backyard, I've decided I'm going to commit my crime capsule crime
[04:36.770 --> 04:41.990]  sometime in the next month. I'm not going to tell you guys what it is, and it will be a crime
[04:41.990 --> 04:46.930]  against one of you probably. And then I'm going to cat and then it'll have it for the cat.
[04:47.070 --> 04:50.610]  So it's like intercompany crime. Yeah. Can it just be a crime against Andrew? Yeah.
[04:51.190 --> 04:54.010]  Could be. Okay. Okay. This is going to be a crime for the capsule.
[04:54.190 --> 04:58.350]  Okay. All right. Let's, let's do it, Geoff. You are the first one to drink. We asked what
[04:58.350 --> 05:02.290]  kind of special drinks we want. I said water, nobody else responded. So we're doing water.
[05:02.330 --> 05:09.530]  I told him water before. Oh, tap water. Oh, I specified water from the pipe that comes into
[05:09.530 --> 05:15.770]  your house. Well, he's got a filter on the fridge. Yeah. Don't tell me, tell him. I just told him.
[05:17.350 --> 05:22.950]  I heard my mouth is like baggy today. Does it feel baggy? We've been up since we've all been
[05:22.950 --> 05:32.910]  up since 5 a.m. 4 59 a.m. 7 hours. 10 counties over. Hey, a cop got hurt. Wake up. Hey, everyone
[05:32.910 --> 05:42.050]  in Austin. Everyone in Texas. It was a statewide alert. People in Houston going like, why did I,
[05:42.210 --> 05:44.610]  what am I supposed to do about this? I will say though, I was in the middle of dreaming.
[05:44.690 --> 05:47.470]  I was shitting liquid everywhere. So I was pretty happy to wake up.
[05:53.510 --> 05:59.090]  Just practicing. Oh my God. I should have warmed up my mouth. The second you put water in your
[05:59.090 --> 06:03.270]  mouth, you think about swallowing it. Yeah. You're not supposed to. All right. Right into
[06:03.270 --> 06:11.770]  the Pyrex. Fill it up. You got it. Don't drink. Okay. All right. All right. Let it settle. Let
[06:11.770 --> 06:17.610]  it settle. Let it settle. Rotate it so that we can get distracted by the meniscus. What is that
[06:17.610 --> 06:26.010]  amount, Geoff? Looks like it's about a half a cup. Just under four ounces. Can I go for a second?
[06:26.130 --> 06:33.950]  I feel like I can get to four. Absolutely not. Why would you need to go again? You already did
[06:33.950 --> 06:42.950]  it one other time. Well, it could be off camera. Get this! What are you, new? Oh, up to the R.
[06:42.950 --> 06:47.710]  Okay. He's trying to split the R. I wonder if one of us could get to the E.
[06:49.350 --> 06:58.150]  Who do you think is the trademark? Okay. G. Okay. Spin that around. Okay. All right. Is that a G?
[06:58.310 --> 07:02.710]  Oh, it's a lowercase. I thought you did it backwards. He's modest. He's lowercase.
[07:03.930 --> 07:10.450]  Uh, Nick, you want to go next? Sure. All right. Here. Thank you. There you go. Minions cup. Classic
[07:10.450 --> 07:15.570]  guy. Definitely a minion. That's me. I'm worried that my mouth is small. I'm very worried about my
[07:15.570 --> 07:20.130]  mouth right now. I'm not super worried about how much I can hold. All right. You don't want to be
[07:20.130 --> 07:26.650]  the throat goat? I said no. Okay. Just to, you know, just to erase the memory of how to do it.
[07:26.710 --> 07:40.290]  This is very disturbing. Here we go. Quick someone's thought. It sounded like taking a piss.
[07:43.830 --> 07:48.610]  You might be exactly tied with Geoff. Oh wow. No, I think he's higher than me. I don't think so.
[07:48.730 --> 07:52.830]  This is going to be some very close lines. Yep. Here we go. All right. This is going to be rough
[07:52.830 --> 08:01.590]  on Geoff. No extra liquid. I appreciate it. Here we go. In goes the gods. Oh, it's over me.
[08:01.730 --> 08:07.110]  It's over. Yeah, it has to be. Every drop. Come on. There we go. Okay. All right. Here we go.
[08:07.310 --> 08:11.930]  I'm wondering if I can store some in my esophagus. Maybe just the top of my esophagus. My esophagus
[08:11.930 --> 08:17.970]  has already been through it. So I'm not, I'm not going to try. All right. Kind of hard on Nick's,
[08:18.050 --> 08:22.790]  but you get it. Yep. Oh, that's pretty good. All right. All right. Clean it out. Clean it out.
[08:23.270 --> 08:26.170]  Oh, that's more nerve wracking than you expect the whole water in your mouth.
[08:28.530 --> 08:38.210]  Oh no. What? I have to use regular tap. I can't. You can't do cold? My tooth is still sensitive.
[08:38.330 --> 08:41.690]  I didn't want to make a thing out of it, but it hurt like hell the whole time. That's why I wanted
[08:41.690 --> 08:49.390]  to go again. It was difficult for me to do it. Yeah. Cause Eric and I both had crowns replaced
[08:49.390 --> 08:54.930]  this week or last week. Yeah. Uh, I got it twice. He got his twice. It was pretty exciting. Oh,
[08:54.970 --> 09:00.610]  the permanent crown came off. When you call the dentist and you tell them that the permanent
[09:00.610 --> 09:09.650]  crown came off, they don't, they're as shocked as you are. I'm just drinking water.
[09:11.770 --> 09:12.790]  That's real instinct.
[09:17.550 --> 09:22.090]  It's like when, uh, when they replaced my chair with a toilet and really made me want to shit.
[09:25.930 --> 09:29.850]  Oh, look at those cheeks. Oh, he's going for more. He's topping up.
[09:31.510 --> 09:33.870]  Oh, Eric, you're squirting water everywhere.
[09:36.530 --> 09:41.090]  What gentlemen? Wow. Why'd you take so long? I wanted to make a good noise.
[09:41.930 --> 09:45.730]  That's good. I might be, I might be higher than Geoff. That might be the most,
[09:46.010 --> 09:51.470]  I might be higher than Geoff. Okay, here we go. Let me see the mills. You got it. Here's the
[09:51.470 --> 10:01.630]  mills for the rest of the world. That might be more than Nick. Hang on every drop, every drop,
[10:01.690 --> 10:07.790]  every drop guys who would have thought I had the biggest mouth. Wow. Okay. So I'm ready to
[10:09.010 --> 10:14.710]  gank. What the fuck? What the fuck was that? Why'd you do it like that?
[10:19.870 --> 10:26.050]  Okay. You can make the water warm. What? What? Oh yeah.
[10:27.510 --> 10:30.690]  You have to come closer to fill it. Oh, you're just getting, oh, you're getting used to it.
[10:30.830 --> 10:36.770]  I don't want my mouth to absorb anything. No, no, no. Oh, okay. Let me know when you're going.
[10:40.130 --> 10:52.130]  Whoa. Okay. Maybe more. Oh, you have to be careful. Some might come out.
[10:53.910 --> 10:59.070]  I didn't think to hold it. Why would you hold it? Well, it's holding it in the back of his hand.
[10:59.150 --> 11:03.550]  Okay. Here you go. Oh, that might be a new, that might be a new. No, I think that's Geoff. No,
[11:03.610 --> 11:06.750]  I think so. I think that's a hundred. Make sure you get all of it. That might be a double G.
[11:07.850 --> 11:10.910]  Wow. The G. Gavin, you and I are indistinguishable.
[11:11.830 --> 11:15.310]  We can pass water between our mouths without any spillage.
[11:16.530 --> 11:19.010]  Well, yeah, dude, there's no... That doesn't mean your seal is good.
[11:20.430 --> 11:24.450]  Dude, we keep wearing the same outfit in games. We spit the same amount.
[11:26.490 --> 11:31.330]  A match made in hell. I'm going to do, it's not a regulation. I just want to do it with warm water.
[11:31.510 --> 11:33.550]  You just, you want to see, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, interesting. Okay.
[11:35.770 --> 11:38.910]  We already got his regulation amount. You have to be careful. Some of it goes back.
[11:41.990 --> 11:48.650]  Oh, you should have done warm water. That blew us all away. You split the arm.
[11:49.750 --> 11:55.530]  Yeah. So it wouldn't have made that much of a difference. Well, here, take a look,
[11:55.630 --> 11:58.890]  Gavin. What do you think? What's our scientific results? Insane to put your hand on that.
[12:01.530 --> 12:04.670]  I'm going to wash my hands. So if we ever do a special throttler edition,
[12:04.870 --> 12:08.890]  it will have these lines on it. Yeah. And maybe one from Andrew. Yeah. Oh,
[12:08.890 --> 12:15.210]  which will be way up here. Uh, wait, hang on. Don't Geoff. Okay. I'm sorry. No, no, that's fine.
[12:15.430 --> 12:22.650]  Hit pause. I'm so excited about this. Yeah. We're, we're a teleport podcast.
[12:24.650 --> 12:31.610]  We're doing camcorder tricks. Get out the high eight camera. We did it. We did it with Nick in
[12:31.610 --> 12:36.270]  the monkey mask where he like, he like teleports, he disappears. And then all of a sudden from a
[12:36.270 --> 12:43.350]  doorframe, he flies into frame and just fucking eats it. It's so good. Um, what are you doing?
[12:43.850 --> 12:50.070]  These are the lines. Gross. This is our new regulation. We have 4,000 of them. If you don't
[12:50.070 --> 12:56.630]  get one, I don't know what to do. This is, it costs, we tried to do it the best way possible
[12:56.630 --> 13:03.710]  where we are working with El Famoso to get these costs under control and make it work and everything.
[13:03.710 --> 13:09.350]  You have no idea how hard it is when they email you and they go, well, there's like
[13:09.350 --> 13:13.370]  an $8,000 cost difference if you just want this way or that way. And you go,
[13:16.370 --> 13:22.710]  4,000 is so many cups. Please buy these cups. There will not be a limit. I would think on how
[13:22.710 --> 13:27.630]  many cups you can buy at once. If you are the industrious person that wants to buy all 4,000
[13:27.630 --> 13:34.930]  for yourself, we can make that work. We'll give you a discount. No, we won't. It's 4,000 for the
[13:34.930 --> 13:41.470]  price of 3,999. No, it should be, if you want to buy all 4,000 cups, you can for the price of 8,000
[13:41.470 --> 13:47.910]  cups. No, I'll sell it to you for 4,005 cups price. Sending it all to one person is way easier
[13:47.910 --> 13:54.430]  than sending it to 4,000. Tell that to the 1,000 clocks you tried to ship to me. A whole bunch of
[13:54.430 --> 13:58.890]  conversations of, can you please cancel this? Can you please cancel this? It's, we're, we're, oh,
[13:58.930 --> 14:04.210]  we're so fucked. Um, so what does this, what did this show us? What did this teach us?
[14:05.490 --> 14:10.750]  Uh, it shows us that Eric has the biggest mouth. Until Andrew does it and we don't trust him.
[14:10.990 --> 14:16.570]  Right, right. Oh, is that your apple bag? Yeah. Comfortably holds three apples. Three
[14:16.570 --> 14:21.250]  cosmic crisps. That, this is as big as a Smurf. Yeah. Smurf is three apples.
[14:21.870 --> 14:26.530]  Really? A Smurf is three apples? A Smurf is no bigger, no, a Smurf is no bigger than three apples.
[14:26.710 --> 14:33.150]  Hello Kitty is five apples, but weighs three apples. Man, I could kick a Smurf so far. This? Yeah. Oh,
[14:33.190 --> 14:40.270]  I could throw this like a football. Which Smurf would you kick though? Brainy. Yeah. No hesitation.
[14:41.370 --> 14:46.910]  Hey, thanks for watching this one. Now you know about the Gerfler. Um, but stay tuned for another
[14:46.910 --> 14:50.550]  video in six months when we see how many apples tall we are. Do you think there's a link in the
[14:50.550 --> 14:57.190]  description of this video somewhere for a Gerfler? I mean, I would imagine this comes out well before the Gerfler. Okay.
[14:58.890 --> 15:04.990]  So maybe. Wait, have Nick teleport. Huh? What?
[15:09.850 --> 15:11.770]  It's camcorder tricks rock.
