[00:00.000 --> 00:05.440]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Geoff Ramsey
[00:05.440 --> 00:13.020]  and with me as always Andrew Pan, Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, and Eric Bedore. This is episode
[00:13.020 --> 00:18.680]  23 and Gavin has just sent a picture of his crotch. He has peed his pants.
[00:19.120 --> 00:22.460]  That happened maybe 16 seconds before we started.
[00:22.880 --> 00:24.580]  What happened?
[00:24.980 --> 00:26.420]  I spilled water on myself.
[00:26.980 --> 00:27.720]  Oh yeah, right.
[00:28.760 --> 00:30.700]  Well, it's not piss because piss wouldn't...
[00:30.700 --> 00:32.880]  Oh, I guess piss would start there if my penis was...
[00:34.980 --> 00:37.680]  I'm not sure... where else would it start, man?
[00:38.400 --> 00:41.320]  I always imagine piss starting right in the center of the crotch,
[00:41.380 --> 00:44.820]  but if your penis has any length it may start down there.
[00:47.500 --> 00:49.720]  So are you the new piss boy or what's going on?
