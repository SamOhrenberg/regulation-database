[00:00.600 --> 00:01.560]  Hello and welcome-
[00:01.560 --> 00:02.260]  That's funny too, because he wasn't in-
[00:03.360 --> 00:05.480]  No, keep going. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, go ahead, Gavin.
[00:05.540 --> 00:07.340]  Hello, I'm gonna do a supplemental, but go ahead, Gavin.
[00:08.640 --> 00:11.240]  He wasn't in Payday either, which was another heist, which is funny.
[00:11.560 --> 00:12.720]  Yeah, he's just not a heist guy.
[00:13.080 --> 00:15.240]  Well, he's not- he doesn't like anything illegal.
[00:15.660 --> 00:18.740]  He's very by the book. That's why he plays Call of Duty or whatever.
[00:18.880 --> 00:19.740]  He's a Man of Honor.
[00:20.380 --> 00:20.660]  Yeah, he's a Man of Honor.
[00:20.660 --> 00:21.580]  Oh no, that's a different series.
[00:21.760 --> 00:23.540]  It's Medal of Honor. That's a different one.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  That's the- is that the other Steven Spielberg one?
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.440]  Remember how that Ridley Scott Delta Force game is coming out?
[00:31.520 --> 00:31.660]  Yeah.
[00:31.740 --> 00:34.480]  That was- Medal of Honor was Saving Private Ryan, right?
[00:34.900 --> 00:36.160]  Didn't they partner with him or something?
[00:36.420 --> 00:37.240]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:37.420 --> 00:38.020]  I think so.
[00:38.140 --> 00:39.140]  That was so long ago.
[00:39.240 --> 00:39.760]  It doesn't matter.
[00:39.860 --> 00:41.680]  What is the- what's the Ridley Scott game?
[00:42.160 --> 00:45.500]  We saw it at Summer Games Fest where they're like,
[00:45.680 --> 00:48.840]  Levels inspired by the Blackhawk Down film.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.960]  That's right. It was called like Delta Force.
[00:52.060 --> 00:52.160]  Delta Force, yeah.
[00:52.160 --> 00:53.160]  I don't think you saw this, Gavin.
[00:53.280 --> 00:56.900]  It's like Delta Force, Blackhawk Down, and it's just like,
[00:56.900 --> 01:02.060]  You are the Blackhawk that has gone down, and you must escape.
[01:02.220 --> 01:04.620]  And it's like, oh, and what year does this game come out?
[01:04.780 --> 01:05.060]  Yeah.
[01:05.380 --> 01:06.140]  What happened?
[01:06.320 --> 01:08.680]  Feature sequences from the Ridley Scott film.
[01:08.760 --> 01:10.800]  And it's like, that was a movie based on a real event.
[01:11.140 --> 01:12.700]  Sort of a weird framing of-
[01:12.700 --> 01:13.200]  It's so bizarre.
[01:13.600 --> 01:16.100]  I mean, there's probably some exaggerated action.
[01:16.460 --> 01:17.740]  But what are we doing here today, Andrew?
[01:17.740 --> 01:19.580]  We're regulating is what we're doing.
[01:19.680 --> 01:21.540]  We are doing- they're calling us the regulators.
[01:21.800 --> 01:23.740]  We are the regulation crew.
[01:23.920 --> 01:26.200]  This is not all of us, but we have three people here.
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.600]  That's enough for a majority.
[01:27.920 --> 01:28.460]  Fuck them.
[01:28.720 --> 01:29.480]  Fuck Nick, fuck Eric.
[01:29.560 --> 01:30.080]  They're not here.
[01:30.360 --> 01:31.060]  They don't get to decide.
[01:31.300 --> 01:31.460]  I'm Eric.
[01:31.760 --> 01:32.620]  Well, now let's be clear.
[01:32.840 --> 01:33.460]  I'm Eric.
[01:34.060 --> 01:35.040]  Oh, I said Eric?
[01:35.240 --> 01:35.780]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:36.360 --> 01:37.080]  Nick and Geoff-
[01:37.080 --> 01:38.800]  Sorry, sorry, man.
[01:39.180 --> 01:40.240]  Gut reaction.
[01:42.680 --> 01:43.720]  Andrew's filler wasn't on.
[01:43.940 --> 01:47.600]  No, I just was looking at our chat, and I just read your name.
[01:47.760 --> 01:49.940]  And I was used to you being away last week.
[01:50.360 --> 01:51.480]  So I'm still adjusting.
[01:53.360 --> 01:55.740]  Fuck Nick, fuck Geoff, is what I meant to say.
[01:55.740 --> 01:56.300]  Okay, cool.
[01:56.480 --> 01:57.280]  Yeah, clearly.
[01:58.060 --> 02:00.140]  And we gotta pick stuff.
[02:00.320 --> 02:02.600]  We gotta set regulations on things.
[02:02.800 --> 02:05.960]  Now, I used to have the regulation bagel, and that was great.
[02:06.340 --> 02:13.000]  So I figured we could go through some items and deem what we view as the regulation version of that thing.
[02:13.480 --> 02:16.420]  These are things with a variety of options.
[02:17.480 --> 02:21.300]  So we've been deep in our hot dog era right now.
[02:21.300 --> 02:22.300]  Eating lots of dogs.
[02:22.360 --> 02:26.300]  I don't think Gavin, I don't think you've had a hot dog, have you?
[02:26.800 --> 02:28.180]  Not yet, I'm not on the board yet.
[02:28.220 --> 02:28.860]  Not on the board.
[02:29.880 --> 02:31.760]  But here's the thing about the hot dog board.
[02:32.240 --> 02:38.020]  And I had to explain this to my dad when I told him about the dog count situation.
[02:38.300 --> 02:42.920]  When I said, oh yeah, I've had like five this month, and that's the most I've had all year.
[02:43.020 --> 02:45.420]  And he went, oh, so it's like a competition to see who can eat the most?
[02:45.500 --> 02:48.400]  And I went, no, it's just a counter to see how many you've had.
[02:48.400 --> 02:59.300]  However, it is activating something within me that makes me feel like it is a competition where I have to keep up and eat the most hot dogs, which negates the whole situation.
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.520]  Yeah, I'd love to talk to Geoff about if that is the same for him.
[03:04.760 --> 03:08.440]  Because that man's on like 10 dogs, and we're like three weeks into this.
[03:08.920 --> 03:10.920]  And the whole point was, this seems crazy.
[03:11.460 --> 03:12.620]  Like no one's going to hit 70.
[03:13.100 --> 03:13.580]  He is.
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.260]  Oh my God.
[03:14.300 --> 03:15.540]  He is consuming so many.
[03:15.540 --> 03:18.420]  But we need to set, what is the regulation hot dog?
[03:18.940 --> 03:25.740]  What do you view, if you were to say, I want a hot dog, what do you think is the expectation of what that package is?
[03:26.180 --> 03:27.060]  Dog ketchup busted.
[03:27.960 --> 03:28.960]  Oh, you don't, okay.
[03:29.940 --> 03:37.260]  But here's the thing, like, I think people get so feisty about what's on a hot dog in specific.
[03:39.820 --> 03:44.200]  Like, I think like Chicago is like a big like, you can't put ketchup, right?
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.060]  Like, isn't that weird?
[03:45.720 --> 03:46.060]  It is.
[03:46.140 --> 03:47.400]  They're like aggressive about it.
[03:47.860 --> 03:48.120]  Yeah.
[03:49.020 --> 03:54.780]  I googled hot dog, and it came up with a ketchup and mustard dog.
[03:55.180 --> 03:55.800]  Interesting.
[03:56.220 --> 03:57.440]  I would agree.
[03:58.000 --> 04:03.720]  I think there'd be a large percentage of people arguing maybe onion or relish.
[04:04.260 --> 04:08.060]  Yeah, and I think that's kind of like where I land more.
[04:08.060 --> 04:14.300]  However, we have to consider that this isn't necessarily what we like, right?
[04:14.840 --> 04:20.000]  It's more about what if you were to get just, hey, we're getting hot dogs.
[04:20.220 --> 04:22.460]  This like, we're not saying anything about it.
[04:22.500 --> 04:23.360]  It's just hot dogs, right?
[04:23.420 --> 04:26.880]  I think we have to like it, but it it's not necessary.
[04:27.260 --> 04:31.400]  Like, if we're setting the regulation, it should probably be representative of us.
[04:31.740 --> 04:37.620]  But I think there also has to be some consideration of like, what the expectation is of that thing.
[04:37.620 --> 04:44.300]  This, this is going to be very hard for me, personally, because I hate ketchup.
[04:44.960 --> 04:45.220]  Really?
[04:45.220 --> 04:46.260]  I hate yellow mustard.
[04:47.060 --> 04:48.300]  I hate relish.
[04:48.900 --> 04:52.040]  I hate like most of the stuff that goes on a hot dog.
[04:52.320 --> 04:54.040]  Here's three hot dogs.
[04:54.440 --> 04:56.300]  I look at these and I go, terrible.
[04:58.020 --> 05:01.420]  So the three hot dogs are one ketchup, one relish, one mustard.
[05:01.920 --> 05:02.400]  Yes.
[05:02.940 --> 05:05.220]  Where does your moisture come from?
[05:05.560 --> 05:07.060]  Where does the wetness happen for you?
[05:07.060 --> 05:13.320]  Like, I, I like a sriracha or typically a chili cheese, uh, is usually what I go with.
[05:13.400 --> 05:21.800]  However, I can't in good conscience say the default, like the regulation hot dog is a chili cheese dog because that's a separate thing.
[05:21.800 --> 05:24.100]  And that's where I'm coming from with this, where it's like...
[05:24.100 --> 05:25.020]  That's totally fair.
[05:25.660 --> 05:33.400]  Yeah, like it's hard for me because I don't like, I don't like ketchup and I like, you know, hearty, like stone ground mustard.
[05:33.540 --> 05:34.920]  I don't like French's yellow.
[05:35.100 --> 05:36.560]  I think it tastes so bad.
[05:36.560 --> 05:37.720]  I think it tastes so, so bad.
[05:38.780 --> 05:41.420]  What about Grey Poupon or whatever that other one is?
[05:41.920 --> 05:43.660]  Yeah, you need like the stone ground mustard.
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.820]  Like that's, that's my move, but like, man, I don't, I don't know.
[05:47.880 --> 05:50.260]  Gavin, like when you eat a hot dog, what are you, what are you putting on your dog?
[05:51.480 --> 05:53.760]  Uh, if I'm eating a dog, it's probably a baseboard.
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.920]  I'm just putting ketchup and mustard.
[05:55.260 --> 05:58.740]  And if there's onions, I'll stick those on, but nothing more advanced than that.
[05:58.760 --> 06:00.780]  You're really, I'm shocked you're not a relish guy.
[06:01.140 --> 06:02.240]  Relish feels so like...
[06:02.240 --> 06:03.620]  No, it looks rough.
[06:04.320 --> 06:06.880]  It's, it's, it's like bad Branston.
[06:07.220 --> 06:09.380]  I was going to say to me, it's Branston adjacent.
[06:09.680 --> 06:10.920]  I figured you'd be all about it.
[06:11.380 --> 06:12.740]  Yeah, but it's too like pickly.
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.120]  Even though Branston pickle is just...
[06:15.120 --> 06:16.360]  Yeah, I don't understand.
[06:16.780 --> 06:17.940]  What are you talking about?
[06:18.940 --> 06:20.120]  It's Branston pickle.
[06:20.740 --> 06:21.380]  This is good.
[06:21.500 --> 06:24.600]  It's already, the whole, it just started and it's already fallen apart.
[06:24.700 --> 06:25.360]  This is fantastic.
[06:25.720 --> 06:28.980]  I had no idea you felt so strongly about ketchup and mustard, Eric.
[06:29.100 --> 06:30.340]  That's really interesting to me.
[06:30.340 --> 06:34.760]  Yeah, I, I've just never been that way.
[06:34.920 --> 06:36.700]  I just don't like that stuff.
[06:36.920 --> 06:41.300]  Ketchup is so sweet to me that it just doesn't belong on most things.
[06:42.240 --> 06:44.760]  And then mustard, like French's yellow mustard.
[06:45.280 --> 06:48.460]  It's just not, it's not appetizing.
[06:48.560 --> 06:49.800]  I don't think it smells or...
[06:49.800 --> 06:50.020]  Sure.
[06:50.140 --> 06:51.460]  Like looks or anything.
[06:52.100 --> 06:52.940]  Ketchup grew on me.
[06:53.320 --> 06:55.460]  I didn't have ketchup until I was in my twenties and I moved here.
[06:55.580 --> 06:56.000]  Really?
[06:56.260 --> 06:57.460]  I always avoided it.
[06:57.560 --> 06:57.640]  Yeah.
[06:57.980 --> 06:58.500]  Interesting.
[06:58.500 --> 06:59.400]  Don't know what happened.
[06:59.580 --> 07:00.260]  Just palate change.
[07:00.360 --> 07:01.800]  Maybe we, we start more gradually.
[07:01.940 --> 07:02.940]  Can we agree on a bun?
[07:03.180 --> 07:05.520]  Are we just talking like a standard white bun?
[07:05.520 --> 07:07.400]  It's gotta be just, yeah, I think it's gotta be just a standard one.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.200]  Like no poppy seeds, no, just a basic plain ass white bun.
[07:11.200 --> 07:25.160]  Yeah, I think it's, I think it's gotta be just a straight white, like, I'm, I, I also think those ones that are cut along the top, like the newfangled bun, I think that's too much, like, advanced bun technology.
[07:25.260 --> 07:25.480]  Sure.
[07:25.480 --> 07:27.320]  I just need the one that you, like, set on the side.
[07:27.400 --> 07:28.480]  It's like a regular hot dog bun.
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.360]  I think that's it.
[07:29.720 --> 07:29.980]  Yeah.
[07:30.460 --> 07:31.800]  Okay, so we all agree on that.
[07:32.340 --> 07:32.500]  Uh-huh.
[07:32.860 --> 07:33.560]  All basic hot dog.
[07:33.580 --> 07:39.460]  We, we're not trying for no smoky, no, like, no crazy, just the standard packaged dog.
[07:40.020 --> 07:40.380]  Yeah.
[07:40.820 --> 07:42.180]  Now we're at the condiment issue.
[07:42.800 --> 07:43.960]  It's a big issue.
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.340]  It's a big issue.
[07:46.260 --> 07:46.620]  Um...
[07:46.620 --> 07:50.500]  Because it sounds to me like there's a world in which you would have mustard, just not...
[07:50.860 --> 07:56.680]  Yeah, I like stone ground mustard, like a, like a big, you know, like the big seed, like, actual mustard.
[07:56.900 --> 07:57.660]  I like that.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.620]  What about English mustard?
[08:00.000 --> 08:00.140]  Oh.
[08:00.500 --> 08:01.420]  What is English mustard?
[08:02.340 --> 08:07.500]  It's yellow still, but it, it's, it will, like, blast up your nostrils if you have too much of it.
[08:07.920 --> 08:10.240]  Oh, like, oh, so it's a hot, it's like a hot mustard.
[08:10.860 --> 08:12.360]  It's not, it's...
[08:12.360 --> 08:13.700]  We talking horseradish-y?
[08:14.060 --> 08:15.420]  It's very horseradish-y, yeah.
[08:15.420 --> 08:15.620]  Okay.
[08:15.620 --> 08:16.400]  It's, it's Coleman's.
[08:16.800 --> 08:17.700]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[08:17.700 --> 08:19.980]  Comes, comes in a powder sometimes, or, or in a little pot.
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.140]  I don't want powdered mustard.
[08:21.280 --> 08:22.140]  Used very sparingly.
[08:22.360 --> 08:22.680]  Huh.
[08:23.080 --> 08:25.160]  I mean, I guess I could be okay with that.
[08:25.360 --> 08:27.720]  I don't know that I've had it.
[08:28.840 --> 08:29.840]  Oh, we gotta get you some.
[08:30.220 --> 08:30.500]  Oh.
[08:31.360 --> 08:31.560]  Okay.
[08:31.560 --> 08:33.860]  What if we all present to you our dogs?
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.320]  But I just told you all the things I don't like.
[08:37.320 --> 08:37.520]  Yeah.
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.940]  I don't think I would be the right person for this one.
[08:38.940 --> 08:41.700]  I think it would be more the mustard that we'd present him with.
[08:41.700 --> 08:41.840]  Yeah.
[08:42.100 --> 08:42.860]  Mustard alternatives.
[08:43.140 --> 08:46.600]  Yeah, and, and also, I don't want to do anything with mustard.
[08:46.720 --> 08:46.760]  I hate it.
[08:46.760 --> 08:47.300]  Yeah, that's fair.
[08:48.020 --> 08:50.720]  I'm convinced that you'll like my mustard.
[08:51.120 --> 08:52.660]  So, so it's this one on the left.
[08:52.740 --> 08:53.460]  The English mustard.
[08:53.840 --> 08:55.040]  It's like thick peanut butter.
[08:55.140 --> 08:58.960]  Yeah, but don't confuse it with like French's, which looks very similar.
[08:59.200 --> 08:59.500]  Yeah.
[08:59.620 --> 09:00.100]  Okay, cool.
[09:00.180 --> 09:01.180]  I mean, I would try it.
[09:01.280 --> 09:02.580]  I just think French's is terrible.
[09:02.580 --> 09:06.720]  And I really like that, that beer mustard, like the picture that I just said.
[09:06.800 --> 09:08.900]  That really like stone ground, like huge seeds.
[09:09.180 --> 09:10.680]  That I think is so good.
[09:10.740 --> 09:11.580]  I love that.
[09:12.500 --> 09:15.300]  But I don't think that's what people go to for hot dogs.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.420]  I think, do we have to get, I guess we have to decide, do we have to get super specific?
[09:21.640 --> 09:23.380]  Or could we just say, a mustard.
[09:23.980 --> 09:25.360]  A mustard is on the dog.
[09:25.580 --> 09:26.280]  And that's good enough.
[09:27.000 --> 09:29.600]  I could say, I could go with just mustard on a dog.
[09:30.020 --> 09:33.480]  The problem is ketchup, because I don't think there's a ketchup alternative to you.
[09:33.940 --> 09:39.780]  No, I think that there's just, I think, I think I will have to sort of acquiesce and be like,
[09:39.860 --> 09:45.120]  this is a thing I don't enjoy, but I understand why people need it on their hot dog.
[09:45.120 --> 09:47.940]  What about bacon? Like that's too extravagant, right?
[09:48.040 --> 09:53.000]  Love it, love it, but does not, I don't think, when I think regulation hot dog, I don't think it's on there.
[09:53.120 --> 09:55.600]  And no cheese as well? I assume that's in the same category.
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.140]  Yeah, I think that cheese is more in like the chili cheese dog territory.
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.740]  And that just becomes, that's like a different food altogether.
[10:07.160 --> 10:07.960]  I guess...
[10:09.280 --> 10:12.320]  Here's the dilemma that I kind of, in my head, I'm now facing with this.
[10:12.320 --> 10:17.340]  I love ketchup, but I'm okay with just mustard on a dog.
[10:17.480 --> 10:23.840]  However, it feels kind of insane for us to say the regulation hot dog is a plain hot dog with just mustard on it.
[10:24.200 --> 10:26.580]  Which is what we're currently proposing.
[10:26.760 --> 10:31.120]  Honestly, honestly, what I would propose is the regulation hot dog is just a hot dog on a bun.
[10:31.760 --> 10:32.520]  That's what I think.
[10:32.560 --> 10:33.620]  Just a plain hot dog?
[10:33.920 --> 10:34.360]  Yes.
[10:34.680 --> 10:35.860]  No one surely has that.
[10:35.860 --> 10:38.820]  Oh, I don't mind a plain hot dog. I'll have a plain dog.
[10:39.380 --> 10:40.480]  On a bun?
[10:40.480 --> 10:43.920]  Oh, I'll eat nine plain hot dogs. Yeah, I don't give a shit.
[10:44.100 --> 10:44.780]  Come on.
[10:44.980 --> 10:45.100]  Yeah!
[10:45.660 --> 10:48.840]  Oh, you gotta get the real flavor of the bread and the meat.
[10:50.440 --> 10:52.060]  The flavor of the bread.
[10:52.060 --> 10:57.220]  I gotta taste the pigeon beak and raccoon feet. Otherwise, what am I doing here, Gavin?
[10:58.140 --> 11:01.240]  This is raccoon 1989, I believe.
[11:02.100 --> 11:03.560]  A slight hazelnut.
[11:03.980 --> 11:04.740]  This is insane.
[11:05.220 --> 11:09.300]  I think you're gonna make the regulation hot dog on a bun.
[11:11.140 --> 11:13.620]  There's already this cream of ketchup and mustard.
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.360]  Well, the problem is, I'm thinking about the other guys. I think Nick hates ketchup, doesn't he? Or Geoff hates ketchup. So one of them hates ketchup.
[11:20.760 --> 11:21.520]  You know, I don't know.
[11:21.640 --> 11:22.980]  I think one of them hates ketchup.
[11:23.200 --> 11:28.040]  I feel like even if you hate ketchup, though, it doesn't... a dog, you can plow through it. It's not a dog.
[11:28.540 --> 11:30.140]  Yeah, listen, I'm all for it.
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.480]  Again, I'm fine with acquiescing. I'm totally fine with it.
[11:34.480 --> 11:43.100]  So, it sounds like we're in agreement that the regulation dog is not necessarily French's mustard, which is, I feel, what most people would say.
[11:43.420 --> 11:55.220]  But a mustard of some kind, ketchup of your choice, and then just a basic white... no bacon, no cheese, just dog, ketchup, mustard.
[11:55.640 --> 12:05.800]  I think that's what it has to be. I think that's what... I think people would argue that a relish belongs on there, but I'll stand on that hill and say, no, I don't think so.
[12:06.800 --> 12:07.680]  I'm not for it.
[12:07.760 --> 12:09.640]  I don't like relish. Yeah, no problem.
[12:09.980 --> 12:14.460]  Yeah, I think it's this. I just sent a picture of... that's hot dogs.
[12:14.880 --> 12:16.940]  I like that that's relish, but they don't use it yet.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.840]  Yeah, absolutely. There also appears to be onions, so, you know.
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.320]  I like that we're in agreement, just before we move off of hot dogs to lock in this regulation dog.
[12:26.880 --> 12:32.240]  Do you get artistic when you do the condiment thing? I never... the lines and all that, I'm not one of those guys.
[12:32.680 --> 12:37.980]  No, I put it down the side of the dog in the bun, so that way it's not splashing all over the place.
[12:38.840 --> 12:41.200]  What about you, Gavin? You a little condiment artist?
[12:41.200 --> 12:43.720]  I do it pretty similarly to the picture there.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.620]  But usually I'm doing, you know, two or three at a time, because I don't want to go up to the counter twice.
[12:48.620 --> 12:49.800]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:49.900 --> 12:53.220]  So my first one is usually the nicest, and then I'm getting pretty messy on the third one.
[12:54.560 --> 12:57.880]  But we did it! We established the regulation dog.
[12:58.120 --> 13:01.620]  But hang on, before we go, I just proposed this. Look at these.
[13:01.960 --> 13:05.600]  Listen, Eric, I'm with you. I love it. Just a plain ass...
[13:05.600 --> 13:12.560]  Here's just... here's just like... here's just eight dogs. Just eight hot dogs, nothing on them.
[13:13.380 --> 13:15.740]  You couldn't put those out with nothing else.
[13:15.740 --> 13:20.100]  People would be like... people would pick up the bun and the dog and start looking around.
[13:20.320 --> 13:22.420]  They'd be like, where's the... where's the station?
[13:22.600 --> 13:29.120]  Imagine Eric, you and I just sitting down, chowing down on some plain dogs, and Gavin's just looking at us like we're psychos.
[13:29.320 --> 13:31.200]  I could easily eat three of those things.
[13:31.740 --> 13:35.960]  Oh, absolutely, no doubt. No doubt. Yeah, we're just eating plain dogs, baby.
[13:36.100 --> 13:37.280]  Unphased. Just having some dogs.
[13:40.180 --> 13:40.560]  Okay.
[13:40.820 --> 13:44.320]  I have a... I just thought of a game, actually, before we move fully onto the dog.
[13:44.320 --> 13:44.940]  Oh, okay, cool.
[13:45.300 --> 13:47.820]  I want your opinion on... on my game.
[13:48.000 --> 13:48.360]  Okay.
[13:48.720 --> 13:49.060]  Pictures.
[13:49.300 --> 13:49.520]  Okay.
[13:49.820 --> 13:55.560]  What if we did a game where you make... you make four dogs, right?
[13:55.660 --> 13:56.000]  Okay.
[13:56.180 --> 14:04.960]  And you take a picture that's sliced like this, but one... and then you present five pictures.
[14:05.220 --> 14:07.700]  Four of them are dogs, and one is my penis.
[14:07.980 --> 14:11.300]  Okay, I don't want to play this... I don't want to play this game at all.
[14:11.300 --> 14:15.580]  I don't want to play... I don't... I don't want to play this game.
[14:15.980 --> 14:24.120]  It's going to be... because they're all going to look professionally lit like this, except the one that you used the flash on in your bathroom.
[14:27.200 --> 14:28.260]  Oh, my God.
[14:29.040 --> 14:32.200]  Oh, it's just like a dark room. It's like white, white, white, dark.
[14:36.180 --> 14:38.460]  What's wrong with the color of this hot dog?
[14:38.460 --> 14:42.760]  Would you put ketchup on your dick for the photo, Gavin? Like, to what extent?
[14:44.140 --> 14:46.220]  I'd make them all match, for sure.
[14:46.560 --> 14:50.120]  Oh, man, that's a terrible game.
[14:50.640 --> 14:52.660]  You fucked up my algorithm, by the way.
[14:52.720 --> 14:59.340]  I got a TikTok the other day from a woman who runs a glory hole business talking about how she set it up.
[14:59.640 --> 14:59.920]  What?
[15:00.140 --> 15:04.400]  And it has like... it had like 200 likes. Like, it was not...
[15:04.400 --> 15:05.140]  No way.
[15:05.140 --> 15:11.040]  Yeah, it was the whole thing. I watched it just completely curious of what even is this world.
[15:11.280 --> 15:15.140]  But you're fucking up my algorithm, you just keep making it worse.
[15:16.700 --> 15:22.160]  That's dogs. Regulation dog. Ketchup, mustard, bun, basic. Basic dog, essentially.
[15:22.460 --> 15:23.940]  We're in agreement. Nothing fancy.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.560]  We have a few things we could go from here.
[15:28.180 --> 15:29.520]  What about we do French fry cut?
[15:30.080 --> 15:34.620]  There's a lot of food on this one, but it's the main thing I could think of a variety of.
[15:34.620 --> 15:36.880]  What about fry? What is the regulation fry?
[15:37.500 --> 15:39.320]  I feel like curly is too fancy.
[15:39.720 --> 15:46.160]  Yeah, I'm particular. I'll eat any French fry, but I'm particular about which fry that I like.
[15:46.260 --> 15:48.020]  Like, which one I enjoy the most.
[15:48.460 --> 15:52.060]  And to me, it is the standard McDonald's cut French fry.
[15:52.360 --> 15:55.980]  The thin, long, and crispy French fry.
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.020]  That, to me, that's the French fry.
[16:00.240 --> 16:03.340]  When I think of French fry, it's that.
[16:03.340 --> 16:05.240]  It's not a wedge cut. It's not curly.
[16:05.580 --> 16:09.100]  It's the standard idea of a French fry.
[16:11.100 --> 16:12.200]  The only criticism...
[16:12.200 --> 16:12.840]  Yeah, I'd choose that.
[16:13.300 --> 16:14.240]  Yeah, right, exactly.
[16:14.700 --> 16:15.020]  It's exactly that.
[16:15.020 --> 16:15.740]  Is it the same thing, Gavin?
[16:16.420 --> 16:18.400]  Yeah, pretty much. Maybe less pale.
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.760]  Right, right, right, right.
[16:21.780 --> 16:26.880]  My only criticism with those fries is because of how small they are, it's really tough.
[16:26.880 --> 16:33.760]  There's a sweet spot with, like, a crinkle cut or a larger fry where it is extremely crispy but still fluffy.
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.600]  Those fries, they're either crunchy or soft.
[16:39.060 --> 16:40.100]  There's no, like, in-between.
[16:40.100 --> 16:42.040]  Yeah, you can get some real limp dick ones in those.
[16:42.040 --> 16:44.560]  Yeah, it's either limp dick or, like, it's a crunch.
[16:45.320 --> 16:47.040]  But the thing is, I love those.
[16:47.500 --> 16:51.900]  I love the limp ones. I love the crunch ones. I love...
[16:52.720 --> 16:56.640]  That cut of french fry, I don't care what it is, I'll shovel them.
[16:57.060 --> 17:00.200]  Like, I'll make a... Dude, I'll have, like, french fry dinner. I don't give a shit.
[17:00.380 --> 17:05.760]  Like, I just want to eat handfuls of them. I love them so much. I love that cut.
[17:05.960 --> 17:14.580]  The one I can't stand, the one that I think is a disgrace, is the larger, not-too-big wedge cut.
[17:14.720 --> 17:21.020]  Like, go bigger or go smaller because the wedge cut ones there are awful.
[17:21.020 --> 17:26.940]  It's just like... Here's about a sixth of a potato.
[17:27.320 --> 17:31.140]  Yes. That's like an English pub chip. That's great.
[17:31.920 --> 17:38.420]  But that's not what I want. Like, if I get french fries at a restaurant, yeah, if I get french fries at a restaurant and it's those, I'm disappointed.
[17:38.940 --> 17:42.220]  It just depends to me. There's a huge variance in the wedge fry.
[17:42.900 --> 17:46.140]  You need to have a fantastic wedge fry for me to like it.
[17:46.140 --> 17:46.460]  I agree.
[17:46.460 --> 17:51.980]  But they exist. It's just hard. I find a lot of wedge fries aren't cooked enough to my liking.
[17:52.160 --> 17:52.920]  No, I agree.
[17:53.040 --> 17:58.180]  To kind of be raw a little bit, it feels like. I want more of a crunch in it, but there are...
[17:58.180 --> 18:03.960]  I've had wedge fries that are fantastic, but you got to know, like, it's not...
[18:03.960 --> 18:10.640]  The smaller cut fry that you suggested, I feel like, is a much higher rate of consistently good fry.
[18:10.640 --> 18:18.360]  As opposed to the wedge may go higher for me, but it is much more likely to fail miserably and be a not good experience.
[18:18.960 --> 18:23.140]  You're a fan of the English less than, but you suggested the smaller one.
[18:23.660 --> 18:27.920]  So even you are more of a fan of that, or are you now just thinking about the English style pub?
[18:28.500 --> 18:31.800]  I mean, in a pub, it wouldn't be a regulation fry. It would be a pub fry.
[18:32.200 --> 18:32.600]  Right.
[18:32.700 --> 18:33.240]  It'd be a chip.
[18:34.460 --> 18:37.560]  So you think that the small fry couldn't exist in every environment?
[18:38.960 --> 18:39.360]  Uh...
[18:39.360 --> 18:41.380]  I feel like if we're setting a regulation...
[18:41.380 --> 18:45.860]  Like with a steak, would you want normal little chips, or would you want some thickies?
[18:46.080 --> 18:55.700]  I want normal chips all the time. But with a steak, I don't anticipate there going to be a regular thin cut fry.
[18:55.820 --> 19:00.200]  I assume I'm going to get a large wedge to substitute for what the potato is doing.
[19:00.720 --> 19:05.900]  Yeah, and you need some... sometimes if you've got gravy going on, or sauce, you need some soakage.
[19:06.720 --> 19:07.160]  Yeah.
[19:07.160 --> 19:10.300]  And you don't want just really wet, thin fry.
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.520]  I will say, the McDonald's poutine can it up pretty good.
[19:13.860 --> 19:14.300]  Oh yeah?
[19:14.300 --> 19:16.400]  And that is a gravy situation with that fry.
[19:16.580 --> 19:16.840]  Wow.
[19:17.580 --> 19:18.040]  Would recommend.
[19:18.460 --> 19:20.620]  Never thought to get McDonald's poutine.
[19:21.140 --> 19:23.020]  Yeah, I think it's a pretty regional item.
[19:23.580 --> 19:23.740]  Yeah.
[19:23.940 --> 19:26.800]  So you think, Eric, that that's the worst fry, like the thick one?
[19:26.800 --> 19:31.520]  Uh, it's the one... it's more the one that I sent than what you sent.
[19:31.720 --> 19:39.920]  Like, the difference to me is that those, like, pub chip, pub fries, whatever, like the ones that you sent,
[19:40.480 --> 19:44.060]  seem like they're fried pretty well and they have, like, some structure.
[19:44.820 --> 19:47.240]  The ones that I sent is what Andrew's talking about.
[19:47.420 --> 19:50.740]  They're pale, they're almost like an undercooked thing.
[19:50.920 --> 19:51.080]  Yeah.
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.580]  When I get fries like that, yeah, you get fries like that and you just go,
[19:55.580 --> 19:57.520]  okay, you put a bunch of parsley on the outside of it.
[19:57.900 --> 19:58.560]  These suck.
[19:59.100 --> 20:03.040]  Like, I'm disappointed more often than not.
[20:04.700 --> 20:05.440]  I get that.
[20:05.520 --> 20:07.140]  I just, you know, it's just not for me.
[20:07.400 --> 20:13.080]  I feel like the worst fry though, the least satisfying piece of shit, get out of my face fry is this.
[20:13.600 --> 20:17.200]  The big mountain, the big mountain of, like, the ultra thin.
[20:17.540 --> 20:21.500]  Ultra skinny, extra, extra thin, awful.
[20:21.640 --> 20:21.940]  Really?
[20:22.460 --> 20:23.440]  You're never satisfied.
[20:23.880 --> 20:25.280]  You're never satisfied with them.
[20:25.280 --> 20:25.540]  No.
[20:25.740 --> 20:26.740]  It just never happens.
[20:26.940 --> 20:29.260]  See, that's a problem with me and fries in general.
[20:29.440 --> 20:32.220]  I will eat a million fries, so I'm never satisfied no matter the cut.
[20:32.820 --> 20:35.460]  Oh, no, I'm satisfied the whole time I'm eating them.
[20:35.600 --> 20:36.500]  That's the hard part.
[20:36.600 --> 20:38.660]  Is that the satisfaction never dwindles.
[20:38.900 --> 20:42.080]  Is that I'm constantly going like, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[20:42.120 --> 20:42.860]  It's like eating candy.
[20:42.980 --> 20:43.840]  Like, I don't want to ever stop.
[20:44.800 --> 20:46.020]  How do we feel about a waffle fry?
[20:46.620 --> 20:48.840]  I like a waffle fry, I just don't, I don't know.
[20:49.660 --> 21:02.080]  For it, but I also, if you said, hey, we're going to have fries or I go to a place and I order fries and they're waffle cut without saying they're waffle cut, I think that's crazy.
[21:02.380 --> 21:03.100]  That's fair.
[21:03.320 --> 21:15.460]  The thing I like about the waffle fry is it is essentially the small fries you're suggesting, but they have a larger variance of hitting that kind of crispy but fluffy because there's more potato.
[21:15.460 --> 21:17.520]  Yeah, there's more like internal area.
[21:17.660 --> 21:21.800]  And I think they're great if you've got a real ketchup situation.
[21:22.060 --> 21:24.540]  It's like a, it's like a ketchup glove.
[21:24.760 --> 21:25.580]  It is.
[21:25.680 --> 21:27.080]  Yeah, it is great for scooping.
[21:27.240 --> 21:36.440]  I like them particularly when it's the waffle, like the waffle cut French fry, but it has like a curly fry kind of seasoning to it.
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.200]  Oh, yeah.
[21:37.240 --> 21:41.340]  That's when I'm real, that's like, I think that's when waffle fries are like at their best.
[21:41.560 --> 21:42.060]  I agree.
[21:42.480 --> 21:43.300]  I'd agree with that.
[21:44.040 --> 21:44.860]  Oh, man.
[21:44.860 --> 21:51.580]  The bad thing about waffle fries is that if it's the edge of a potato, you get these really weird like curved dreggy ones.
[21:51.840 --> 21:52.120]  Yes.
[21:52.300 --> 21:53.940]  And they are really annoying to me.
[21:54.000 --> 21:54.920]  They really piss me off.
[21:55.120 --> 21:56.160]  I don't know why they're...
[21:56.160 --> 21:57.240]  No, I get it.
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.740]  I mean, I totally understand.
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.160]  You feel like you're getting...
[22:00.160 --> 22:01.420]  It's like a potato chip almost.
[22:01.680 --> 22:02.220]  It is weird.
[22:03.080 --> 22:05.480]  Like the thing with a normal fry is that they're all pretty good.
[22:06.300 --> 22:06.540]  Yeah.
[22:06.640 --> 22:09.680]  But the dreggy waffle fries are just really unsatisfying.
[22:09.800 --> 22:10.920]  The ratios are all screwed up.
[22:11.820 --> 22:14.420]  To me, it's the thing that Chick-fil-A does.
[22:14.420 --> 22:25.360]  I feel like I get it more often at something like Chick-fil-A where it's what you're talking about, Gavin, where it's like, oh, okay, you got a couple of good ones.
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.240]  And then here's this like little wackadoo piece.
[22:28.360 --> 22:28.560]  Yeah.
[22:28.740 --> 22:31.040]  And it's just like, here's the outside of a potato.
[22:31.320 --> 22:35.840]  And what it is, even if the taste is fine, it's work for you because you're watching them.
[22:35.920 --> 22:36.520]  You're eyeing them up.
[22:36.560 --> 22:37.820]  You're thinking, oh, that's going to be a great one.
[22:37.860 --> 22:38.520]  I'm going to save that.
[22:38.600 --> 22:39.240]  Let me get some of these.
[22:39.340 --> 22:43.320]  And then it's just like, I don't want to be, you know, if it's normal fries, I'm not really thinking about that.
[22:43.320 --> 22:44.300]  I'm just grabbing a handful.
[22:44.480 --> 22:45.160]  I'm stuffing them in.
[22:45.640 --> 22:46.160]  Yeah.
[22:46.620 --> 22:46.840]  Yeah.
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.420]  Uh, have you had the waffle fry cut?
[22:52.500 --> 22:56.480]  Like, they're very, very thin cut waffle fry, like chips.
[22:56.680 --> 22:56.920]  No.
[22:57.900 --> 23:00.580]  Oh, that was so good.
[23:01.160 --> 23:01.240]  Yeah.
[23:01.360 --> 23:01.700]  Yeah.
[23:01.700 --> 23:07.140]  I would say they're more like a potato chip than they are the fry, but it's the same kind of principle.
[23:07.300 --> 23:08.160]  They're very good.
[23:08.160 --> 23:13.840]  They're very just thin and crispy and you can mow through like a million.
[23:14.220 --> 23:15.220]  Great for dipping too.
[23:15.360 --> 23:15.860]  I really like them.
[23:15.920 --> 23:18.480]  Is that like in a restaurant or like where would you get those?
[23:18.940 --> 23:23.380]  Yeah, there was a there's a bar in San Diego that I would go to all the time and they had those on the menu.
[23:23.620 --> 23:25.500]  And you would just like, you go insane for them.
[23:25.560 --> 23:26.200]  They're so good.
[23:26.400 --> 23:29.920]  I'm going to post a general fry chart just so we could kind of lock this in a little bit.
[23:29.920 --> 23:30.860]  Oh, look at this.
[23:30.880 --> 23:33.880]  And then we can get Chris Damaris in here and he can yell about tater tots.
[23:34.040 --> 23:34.500]  This is great.
[23:34.940 --> 23:35.380]  There they are.
[23:35.480 --> 23:35.960]  Number three.
[23:36.520 --> 23:37.520]  Not a French fry.
[23:38.540 --> 23:39.600]  Sounds like which one?
[23:39.680 --> 23:40.380]  The standard cut.
[23:40.500 --> 23:42.200]  Is that what you guys are saying is the one you're leaning?
[23:42.380 --> 23:45.460]  I would I would say standard cut would be it.
[23:46.240 --> 23:46.640]  Right.
[23:47.060 --> 23:49.180]  It seems like I'm fine with that.
[23:49.420 --> 23:50.280]  I think it's a pretty good fry.
[23:50.420 --> 23:51.740]  I think everyone would agree.
[23:53.100 --> 23:53.480]  Oh, yeah.
[23:53.580 --> 23:55.340]  The steak fry.
[23:55.500 --> 23:56.420]  They're pretty good.
[23:56.520 --> 23:57.120]  I don't know.
[23:58.180 --> 24:01.460]  Chips British are different to steak fries and standard cut.
[24:03.580 --> 24:04.360]  Oh, interesting.
[24:04.880 --> 24:05.040]  Yeah.
[24:05.040 --> 24:05.960]  And there's potato wedges.
[24:06.060 --> 24:06.700]  That should be way lower.
[24:06.800 --> 24:09.120]  I think there's a thing that you kind of touched on, Eric.
[24:09.180 --> 24:09.980]  We haven't really explored.
[24:10.880 --> 24:12.420]  Seasoning is so important on the fries.
[24:12.980 --> 24:14.160]  Do we have like a unanimous?
[24:14.280 --> 24:15.940]  I love the curly fry seasoning.
[24:16.020 --> 24:18.120]  If I could have that on every fry, I think I would.
[24:19.060 --> 24:20.440]  I like that, too, but I don't need it.
[24:20.520 --> 24:21.700]  Like, I'm fine with just salt.
[24:22.340 --> 24:23.280]  I'm fine with salt, too.
[24:23.380 --> 24:27.420]  But I'm fine with salt because you only get the curly fry seasoning on the curly fry.
[24:27.900 --> 24:31.520]  If there was a place that just put it on all fries, I would be happy about that.
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.780]  I would never be disappointed to have that seasoning on a french fry.
[24:36.400 --> 24:40.760]  If I had crinkle cut fries with curly fry seasoning, that'd be a pretty good french fry.
[24:41.320 --> 24:42.800]  How do you feel about that, Gavin?
[24:43.420 --> 24:43.680]  Yeah.
[24:44.080 --> 24:44.480]  Yeah?
[24:45.820 --> 24:46.220]  Yeah?
[24:47.200 --> 24:50.600]  I just think, I think for a regulation french fry, it has to be salt.
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.460]  It just has to be a straight salt one.
[24:53.100 --> 24:53.420]  Okay.
[24:53.800 --> 24:57.440]  I'm confused as to why sweet potato fries would be on that list.
[24:58.200 --> 24:58.980]  How do you mean?
[24:58.980 --> 25:02.260]  I mean, is that the only non-regular potato on the list?
[25:03.060 --> 25:04.220]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[25:04.480 --> 25:06.660]  That's just a different thing to me. It's a different item.
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.220]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree.
[25:10.120 --> 25:12.460]  Yeah, I don't think it probably needs to be on that list.
[25:13.080 --> 25:13.440]  Okay.
[25:13.880 --> 25:19.580]  Well, it looks like we are in agreement. The standard cut, like the McDonald's-style fry, just salt.
[25:20.420 --> 25:22.080]  I don't think there's any other variation, really.
[25:22.560 --> 25:23.860]  Condiments, do whatever you want.
[25:24.460 --> 25:26.820]  Dip it however you feel. Or don't.
[25:26.840 --> 25:27.000]  Yeah.
[25:27.000 --> 25:32.020]  How do you feel, Gavin, while we're looking at Eric and I just eating some fries no dip? Is that okay?
[25:32.460 --> 25:33.660]  That's fine, absolutely fine.
[25:33.860 --> 25:34.900]  Okay, cool.
[25:35.080 --> 25:41.960]  Okay, alright, but then what if we eat like six fries and then we put them down and then we pick up six hot dogs?
[25:42.580 --> 25:43.380]  No condiments.
[25:43.660 --> 25:47.640]  What if we are dipping our fries in a condiment but just eating plain hot dogs?
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.480]  Yeah, that'd be insane. I don't think anyone would ever do that.
[25:53.120 --> 25:55.500]  Oh, I've definitely done that. I've been there.
[25:57.960 --> 26:01.460]  Plain hot dogs but dipping your fries in ketchup would be hilarious.
[26:04.660 --> 26:08.020]  Okay, we have a few things we can pick from now.
[26:08.560 --> 26:09.080]  Okay.
[26:09.140 --> 26:10.160]  I'll let you guys decide.
[26:11.800 --> 26:18.960]  We can stick with food. I have burger, pie, or action hero.
[26:19.640 --> 26:22.600]  I kind of want to argue about pie. Do you want to argue about pie, Gavin?
[26:22.980 --> 26:23.340]  Yes.
[26:24.040 --> 26:24.560]  Okay.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.260]  What is the regulation pie?
[26:26.260 --> 26:30.360]  I love apple pie, my favorite pie. I don't know if I'd say that's the regulation pie.
[26:31.100 --> 26:34.020]  I feel like it's too high of a tier in my opinion.
[26:34.520 --> 26:34.760]  Okay.
[26:34.960 --> 26:35.580]  I have a question.
[26:36.020 --> 26:38.440]  How is cheesecake not a pie?
[26:38.900 --> 26:44.040]  I don't know. It doesn't make sense to me either.
[26:44.160 --> 26:46.500]  It has like a biscuity base.
[26:46.640 --> 26:49.080]  Yeah, like a graham cracker crust?
[26:49.480 --> 26:49.800]  Yeah.
[26:49.940 --> 26:53.660]  Yeah, everything about it is pie except in name.
[26:53.660 --> 26:56.260]  I'll look it up. I'll see if there's an answer to this question.
[26:56.740 --> 26:58.740]  Because if it is a pie, it's my favorite pie.
[26:59.300 --> 27:03.560]  I agree with you. If cheesecake is a pie, then that is the ultimate pie.
[27:03.760 --> 27:07.700]  Although if someone asked me if I wanted cheese pie, I'd be like, get that away from me.
[27:10.080 --> 27:15.000]  I think if somebody said, do you want a slice of pie? And then they gave me a piece of cheesecake, I would be confused.
[27:16.860 --> 27:20.360]  I would be thrilled. I'd be going, oh my God, we're having fucking cheesecake? That's great.
[27:20.900 --> 27:26.940]  I guess it's not a pie because according to the Oxford Dictionary, a cheesecake is a type of tart.
[27:31.540 --> 27:33.160]  But it is a common question.
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.400]  What makes it pie? Like the top has to be...
[27:37.400 --> 27:43.060]  I bet it's probably crust all the way up to like a top and then probably like a crust.
[27:43.220 --> 27:44.180]  Cheesecake is lidless.
[27:44.180 --> 27:46.480]  No, because so is pumpkin pie.
[27:46.780 --> 27:47.560]  Fuck, yeah.
[27:47.600 --> 27:47.880]  Is it?
[27:48.080 --> 27:49.160]  Pumpkin pie is lidless.
[27:49.160 --> 27:50.160]  Yeah, it is.
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.020]  I thought it had a top.
[27:51.540 --> 27:51.940]  No.
[27:52.120 --> 27:52.440]  What?
[27:52.780 --> 27:53.600]  A typical pumpkin pie.
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.640]  Here, pumpkin pie, boom, here.
[27:56.580 --> 27:58.440]  There's no, there's no top on a pumpkin pie.
[27:59.120 --> 28:01.660]  Oh, that's not, I've never had it. It looks, it looks repulsive.
[28:02.400 --> 28:03.760]  You've never had pumpkin pie?
[28:03.940 --> 28:05.400]  Pumpkin isn't food. It shouldn't be eaten.
[28:05.860 --> 28:08.420]  What about, I think pumpkin is mostly food.
[28:08.680 --> 28:09.240]  It's not food.
[28:10.360 --> 28:11.500]  What is pumpkin then?
[28:12.820 --> 28:13.120]  Yeah.
[28:13.960 --> 28:15.740]  It's like Halloween shit.
[28:17.220 --> 28:18.740]  It's decoration you can grow?
[28:19.160 --> 28:22.320]  Yeah, it's a growable decoration. That's all it's good for.
[28:23.160 --> 28:26.100]  I was going to say that pumpkin pie was my pick for pie.
[28:26.500 --> 28:27.500]  That's interesting.
[28:27.960 --> 28:28.260]  God.
[28:28.480 --> 28:29.380]  I love pumpkin pie.
[28:29.380 --> 28:29.540]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[28:29.740 --> 28:32.980]  My grandma would make it and put a layer of cheesecake at the bottom.
[28:33.280 --> 28:34.500]  Oh, oh, so good.
[28:34.580 --> 28:35.140]  But that's not...
[28:35.140 --> 28:35.600]  Oh my God.
[28:35.780 --> 28:36.980]  Wouldn't that make it a pumpkin tart?
[28:38.540 --> 28:42.800]  I suppose so, but for the sake of this argument, I would still pick pumpkin pie.
[28:43.000 --> 28:44.520]  I could probably house a whole pumpkin pie.
[28:44.680 --> 28:46.280]  I think I could probably eat a whole pumpkin pie.
[28:46.280 --> 28:47.920]  What about, okay, well, let's find Gavin.
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.300]  What is outside of pumpkin?
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.120]  Are there any other pies you hate?
[28:53.500 --> 28:55.880]  I hate all pies that you would find here.
[28:55.940 --> 28:57.220]  I hate all sweet pies.
[28:57.880 --> 28:58.620]  I knew it.
[28:58.800 --> 29:00.260]  This is why I wanted to argue pie.
[29:00.960 --> 29:02.620]  This is why I wanted to argue pie.
[29:02.780 --> 29:05.360]  I knew that Gavin, when we go, what's the best pie?
[29:05.460 --> 29:07.220]  He was going to be like, it was going to be this.
[29:07.360 --> 29:08.940]  And this isn't even like food to me.
[29:09.240 --> 29:09.940]  This is insane.
[29:10.080 --> 29:10.760]  This is like...
[29:10.760 --> 29:11.320]  That's a pie.
[29:11.320 --> 29:18.720]  What if, what if you took what a dog eats and then you put it on the inside of how you make an apple pie?
[29:19.600 --> 29:21.180]  And then you just feed it to people.
[29:21.360 --> 29:23.120]  And then you feed it to people as a joke.
[29:23.260 --> 29:27.080]  I just don't know why then, why your pies aren't called dessert pies.
[29:27.680 --> 29:29.340]  A pie shouldn't be so...
[29:30.140 --> 29:32.340]  It shouldn't be able to fit in any part of the meal.
[29:33.020 --> 29:34.340]  Well, what pie came first?
[29:34.820 --> 29:36.640]  Cause it's, they're savory pies.
[29:36.900 --> 29:38.680]  Which was the first pie?
[29:38.680 --> 29:39.560]  Yeah, what was the first pie?
[29:39.560 --> 29:42.780]  I bet, I bet it was savory pies before sweet pies, don't you think?
[29:42.780 --> 29:45.460]  I would bet that too, but it is odd that there is a...
[29:45.460 --> 29:47.920]  Pie is just pie, unless it's savory pie.
[29:48.420 --> 29:49.800]  Ancient Egypt and Greece.
[29:50.500 --> 29:53.140]  Savory pies in open pastry shells.
[29:53.800 --> 29:54.040]  Yeah.
[29:54.480 --> 29:55.860]  Yeah, that, I mean, that makes sense.
[29:55.880 --> 29:59.120]  I can't imagine ancient Egypt chowing down on some pumpkin pie.
[29:59.360 --> 30:00.600]  It just feels...
[30:00.600 --> 30:01.440]  That's odd.
[30:01.980 --> 30:07.020]  They found a tablet carved before 2000 BC and it was a recipe for chicken pie.
[30:07.740 --> 30:08.080]  Oh!
[30:10.680 --> 30:15.020]  I just think that when, when this is on the table...
[30:15.020 --> 30:15.500]  Oh God.
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.800]  Like, this isn't...
[30:19.300 --> 30:22.520]  This is like what Gavin wants and I don't understand it.
[30:23.060 --> 30:25.260]  I wonder when the last time I had a pucker pie was.
[30:26.000 --> 30:26.240]  What?
[30:26.400 --> 30:27.400]  Is that what that is?
[30:27.820 --> 30:31.540]  Nah, it was like a brand of little tiny pies, I think.
[30:32.020 --> 30:32.420]  Let me see.
[30:33.220 --> 30:33.820]  Pucker pie.
[30:34.460 --> 30:38.560]  I don't want casserole with like a bread crust, which is what that one pie looks like.
[30:39.240 --> 30:42.620]  It looks like there's corn and beans.
[30:43.040 --> 30:46.080]  Dude, fucking yuck-a-pucker pies, what is that?
[30:48.580 --> 30:51.600]  That looks deceptively good from the outside.
[30:52.180 --> 30:55.640]  Yeah, but wait, hey, but are you ready to see the inside, Andrew?
[30:55.720 --> 30:56.120]  I'm ready.
[30:56.840 --> 30:57.940]  You're gonna get pissed.
[30:58.100 --> 30:59.060]  You ready to be pissed?
[30:59.100 --> 30:59.480]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[31:00.260 --> 31:00.960]  Fuck that!
[31:01.280 --> 31:02.260]  Fuck that!
[31:02.860 --> 31:04.000]  That's some bullshit.
[31:04.700 --> 31:09.300]  That is like one of those games where they have to jump in the box and they can't see what it is.
[31:09.660 --> 31:12.860]  That looks delicious on the... what a fucking joke.
[31:13.300 --> 31:14.540]  What a mean joke.
[31:14.560 --> 31:16.080]  They've got cheese, leek, and potato.
[31:16.300 --> 31:17.240]  They've got steak and ale.
[31:17.460 --> 31:18.560]  They've got cheese and stuffing.
[31:19.100 --> 31:19.700]  Oh, chicken and stuffing.
[31:19.720 --> 31:25.480]  Dude, this is the craziest... this might be the craziest meal I've ever seen.
[31:25.640 --> 31:31.020]  It's one of those pies and french fries with some... are those peas?
[31:32.080 --> 31:35.240]  Well, peas... you don't forget mushy peas if you're having fish and chips.
[31:36.080 --> 31:37.280]  Mushy peas are a side.
[31:37.780 --> 31:37.900]  Sure.
[31:38.120 --> 31:42.880]  There's nothing better than sitting down with the family, having a little fish and chips.
[31:42.980 --> 31:46.620]  Someone might get a pucker pie and you just eat it on paper on the table.
[31:46.860 --> 31:47.120]  Brilliant.
[31:47.560 --> 31:48.160]  Happy Sunday.
[31:48.460 --> 31:55.360]  You know what the problem with the pie, the savory pie, is it looks like you've gutted an animal and the insides are just coming out.
[31:55.420 --> 31:55.600]  Yes.
[31:55.860 --> 31:56.880]  I agree.
[31:57.460 --> 31:57.900]  Visually.
[31:58.080 --> 31:59.760]  But it's all food that you would eat normally.
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.740]  I know, but it's just chicken or steak.
[32:02.360 --> 32:08.340]  Like, I don't disagree, but there's something about the framing of it visually that is just repulsive to me.
[32:08.740 --> 32:09.260]  Yes.
[32:09.660 --> 32:09.920]  Yeah.
[32:10.460 --> 32:18.120]  Where you have something like... like, look... I mean... look at this.
[32:18.180 --> 32:19.080]  That's beautiful.
[32:19.320 --> 32:20.520]  That looks way more gory.
[32:21.820 --> 32:22.240]  What?
[32:23.080 --> 32:25.840]  That looks like a dead animal. It's all blood and...
[32:26.280 --> 32:31.600]  No, the pie above that you're showing, the meat pie thing.
[32:31.660 --> 32:31.940]  Yeah.
[32:32.080 --> 32:36.060]  That looks like you cut into the tauntaun or whatever the fuck that thing in Star Wars is.
[32:36.420 --> 32:38.280]  And you gotta make room for heat.
[32:38.500 --> 32:39.680]  Gavin, look at... Gavin, look at that blueberry pie.
[32:39.680 --> 32:40.760]  That looks delicious.
[32:41.280 --> 32:44.160]  That's just a bucket of blueberries with shit on top.
[32:44.200 --> 32:44.520]  Yeah.
[32:45.100 --> 32:49.120]  That's barely been converted to a pie. At least the pumpkin pie, you couldn't see a pumpkin.
[32:49.580 --> 32:53.360]  Right, but isn't that what you just argued about the pucker pie and everything?
[32:53.360 --> 32:56.460]  Is that it's just what you would eat anyway, but in a pie crust?
[32:56.940 --> 32:58.800]  Yeah, but would you eat a bowl of blueberries?
[32:59.300 --> 33:00.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[33:00.720 --> 33:01.340]  I did yesterday.
[33:01.340 --> 33:04.840]  I sat down and ate a bunch of strawberries and bananas earlier. What are you talking about?
[33:04.900 --> 33:07.740]  Would you eat... hey, hey, dude, would you eat a bunch of fruit?
[33:08.300 --> 33:08.620]  Yeah.
[33:08.780 --> 33:09.240]  I feel like...
[33:09.240 --> 33:09.420]  What?
[33:09.560 --> 33:12.880]  I feel like a little pun of blueberries. You're gonna be putting them on stuff.
[33:12.980 --> 33:16.960]  They're gonna be, like, decorative. You're not just gonna have a bowl spoon full of tiny blueberries.
[33:17.360 --> 33:19.440]  Wait, is all fruit decorative to you?
[33:19.740 --> 33:20.040]  No.
[33:20.120 --> 33:21.280]  What tiny fruit is?
[33:21.820 --> 33:22.140]  Everything.
[33:22.140 --> 33:23.880]  It's like eating a bowl of cherries.
[33:24.460 --> 33:26.200]  Cherries are for putting on top, alright?
[33:26.340 --> 33:26.740]  No.
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.720]  Not for snacking on 50 cherries.
[33:28.940 --> 33:29.840]  I've absolutely eaten bowls of cherries.
[33:30.480 --> 33:31.520]  You must have had the shits.
[33:32.540 --> 33:38.560]  So pumpkin, blueberry, and cherry are all just decorations that you can grow?
[33:38.660 --> 33:43.580]  No, no, no. Pumpkin is decoration that you shouldn't even eat. At least with a cherry, you can eat it.
[33:44.900 --> 33:45.360]  I just...
[33:45.360 --> 33:49.840]  I think a meat pie is... dude, a meat pie is crazy.
[33:50.020 --> 33:51.480]  What about a Christmas with a mince pie?
[33:51.480 --> 33:53.080]  I don't know what that is.
[33:53.080 --> 33:54.580]  I just don't like mince. That's my problem.
[33:54.660 --> 33:54.860]  It's not actually mince.
[33:54.860 --> 33:56.120]  I don't know what mince is.
[33:56.960 --> 33:58.020]  Mince pie Christmas.
[33:58.020 --> 33:59.920]  Well, that's not my fault.
[34:00.300 --> 34:01.100]  It's a confusing name.
[34:01.120 --> 34:01.500]  Is it sweet?
[34:01.740 --> 34:02.740]  Now, what do you think of this?
[34:02.920 --> 34:04.600]  Ah, shit! Do I wanna...
[34:04.600 --> 34:04.780]  That?
[34:05.060 --> 34:05.800]  There you go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:05.840 --> 34:09.360]  See, that's the most appealing, because it doesn't look like it's bleeding out.
[34:09.840 --> 34:11.460]  It's like a fruit... it's fruity.
[34:12.100 --> 34:12.880]  Is it raisins?
[34:13.340 --> 34:19.740]  Uh, I don't know if it's raisins. It's usually, like, fruits of the forest and all that. Like raspberries and blackberries and...
[34:19.740 --> 34:25.860]  Okay, so you're fine with that, but for some reason, blueberries is weird?
[34:26.180 --> 34:27.600]  I'm only fine with that at Christmas.
[34:28.420 --> 34:31.460]  Fruits of the forest is such a funny descriptor.
[34:32.900 --> 34:42.240]  Uh, looking at the photo you shared, Gavin, I feel like a child, because I realized that if that star crust wasn't on top, it would be infinitely less delicious looking to me.
[34:42.400 --> 34:42.940]  Oh, I totally agree.
[34:42.940 --> 34:45.380]  That star is carrying the entire dish.
[34:45.440 --> 34:48.060]  It's doing... yeah, the star is doing, like, a lot of heavy lifting.
[34:48.060 --> 34:55.740]  Uh, I... I just don't think when you think pie, that's not... that's not the regulation pie.
[34:55.820 --> 34:56.760]  No, it can't be.
[34:56.940 --> 34:58.840]  No, it's not regulation, but I think a lot of them are apple.
[34:59.320 --> 35:01.640]  So apple pie would be the regulation pie?
[35:02.680 --> 35:03.140]  Uh...
[35:03.140 --> 35:05.240]  Well, are you... wait, are you a fan of apple pie?
[35:05.880 --> 35:06.460]  No, not really.
[35:08.360 --> 35:10.880]  It's fine, I don't like ketchup or mustard.
[35:10.880 --> 35:20.480]  I think if... if... if you think pie from, like, a media perspective, like, uh, like a movie, someone's getting pie, it's gonna be apple pie.
[35:20.900 --> 35:21.860]  The thing, though...
[35:21.860 --> 35:22.260]  I agree.
[35:22.380 --> 35:23.680]  The problem with setting a regulation...
[35:23.680 --> 35:24.540]  What pie got shagged in that film?
[35:25.400 --> 35:25.620]  Yeah.
[35:26.080 --> 35:26.320]  It is.
[35:26.320 --> 35:27.160]  Oh, yeah, that was apple pie.
[35:27.260 --> 35:27.880]  It was, yeah.
[35:28.540 --> 35:30.920]  Do you ever, um... no, go for it, Andrew.
[35:30.920 --> 35:38.540]  I was gonna say, the problem with establishing a regulation, I feel like if we put it at the peak, that lowers all other pies, if that makes sense.
[35:38.780 --> 35:39.620]  Yeah, too bad.
[35:39.940 --> 35:40.660]  Too bad? Okay.
[35:40.660 --> 35:41.120]  Like...
[35:41.120 --> 35:41.760]  That's the thought on it?
[35:41.780 --> 35:45.520]  Yeah, I mean... I mean, to me, a regulation pie being apple pie makes so much sense.
[35:45.620 --> 35:45.800]  Okay.
[35:45.940 --> 35:49.880]  Have you guys ever... you're gonna think I'm nuts, probably.
[35:50.760 --> 35:53.240]  Um, this... I'm not proposing this to be regulation.
[35:53.380 --> 35:53.460]  Okay.
[35:53.460 --> 35:54.960]  I think apple pie should be the regulation pie.
[35:55.260 --> 35:58.080]  Have you guys ever done, uh, apple pie with a piece of yellow cheese?
[35:58.160 --> 35:59.340]  No, but I want to.
[35:59.560 --> 35:59.760]  Oh, God.
[35:59.920 --> 36:02.780]  That's something Geoff and I have been meaning to try, is a different thing.
[36:02.800 --> 36:09.520]  Yeah, I, uh... he orders it in taxi driver, and I remember being in college and going, like, that's crazy, there's no way it's good.
[36:09.520 --> 36:11.840]  It's so fucking good.
[36:12.140 --> 36:15.340]  I love a piece of apple pie...
[36:15.500 --> 36:17.020]  ...with a slice of yellow cheese on it.
[36:17.080 --> 36:17.660]  That's insane.
[36:17.700 --> 36:17.920]  It's so good.
[36:18.160 --> 36:19.320]  That is batshit.
[36:19.600 --> 36:20.020]  It's so...
[36:20.020 --> 36:20.500]  That is...
[36:20.500 --> 36:21.300]  Oh, it's so good.
[36:21.740 --> 36:25.700]  It's like Maine... I don't remember, there's a certain state that that is their dessert.
[36:26.100 --> 36:27.400]  Like, that is the state dessert.
[36:27.460 --> 36:27.820]  Oh, really?
[36:27.860 --> 36:30.440]  I don't remember which one it is, though, but...
[36:30.440 --> 36:31.480]  I loved it.
[36:31.580 --> 36:33.180]  I was, like, so impressed by it.
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.160]  I... it's... it adds, like, a weird creaminess to it that you're not expecting from your pie.
[36:38.160 --> 36:40.360]  And it is, like, it's bonkers.
[36:40.460 --> 36:40.860]  I love it.
[36:40.900 --> 36:44.640]  I'm surprised you're not on board for this, Gavin, because I feel like it's adding savory to a sweet.
[36:46.500 --> 36:46.860]  Uh...
[36:46.860 --> 36:48.000]  I would try it.
[36:48.120 --> 36:49.360]  But it doesn't...
[36:49.360 --> 36:51.000]  I mean, let's be honest, it doesn't look good.
[36:51.400 --> 36:52.140]  No, it doesn't.
[36:52.180 --> 36:54.040]  But, boy, is it fucking delicious.
[36:54.160 --> 36:56.400]  I would argue it looks better than any of the pies you've posted.
[36:56.880 --> 36:57.400]  That's true.
[36:57.520 --> 36:57.680]  Okay.
[36:57.760 --> 36:58.880]  I haven't posted all my pies.
[36:58.960 --> 36:59.960]  What about a shepherd's pie?
[37:00.640 --> 37:01.440]  Yeah, I don't...
[37:01.440 --> 37:01.960]  No, fuck no.
[37:02.420 --> 37:03.280]  That is...
[37:03.280 --> 37:08.580]  If pumpkin pie isn't pie, that is just simply dog food with mashed potatoes on top.
[37:08.660 --> 37:09.340]  It's lamb.
[37:10.280 --> 37:12.700]  I really like the top half of that.
[37:12.720 --> 37:13.300]  Okay, so...
[37:14.860 --> 37:18.540]  I like that this pie doesn't even have a bottom. It's usually just done in a big dish...
[37:18.540 --> 37:18.660]  No!
[37:18.900 --> 37:21.280]  ...where there's meat, and then you just put potato on top.
[37:21.420 --> 37:25.840]  See, that's the problem for me, because I think the crust is, like, 60 to 70% of a good pie.
[37:26.460 --> 37:26.680]  Yeah.
[37:26.780 --> 37:28.340]  I 100% agree with you.
[37:28.340 --> 37:28.920]  I love a good pie.
[37:29.300 --> 37:33.580]  It's potentially a crustless pie, unless you really crisp up the spud on top.
[37:34.560 --> 37:36.820]  Which I'm a fan of. That sounds great.
[37:37.680 --> 37:38.320]  But it's...
[37:38.320 --> 37:38.600]  No.
[37:38.760 --> 37:39.540]  You know, I don't wanna...
[37:41.360 --> 37:43.080]  Do Americans eat peas, ever?
[37:43.780 --> 37:43.980]  Yeah.
[37:44.100 --> 37:44.320]  Yeah.
[37:45.180 --> 37:46.000]  Just by themselves.
[37:46.340 --> 37:47.000]  Just not in a pie.
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.900]  Yeah, I think it's just a side of... I think it's just, like, side of peas.
[37:50.100 --> 37:52.800]  And then also, like, you guys have, like, mushy peas? We don't do mushy.
[37:53.840 --> 37:54.880]  I'm not a fan of the mush.
[37:55.600 --> 37:56.080]  Oh, is that right?
[37:56.080 --> 38:03.960]  I don't even, like... Is it dry? Like, is it a wet mush? Like, is it... I don't even understand what a mush is.
[38:04.400 --> 38:05.580]  Let me get you some mushy peas.
[38:08.580 --> 38:13.540]  See, once again, all of the food that Gavin's posting is a mean trick.
[38:13.540 --> 38:16.820]  He's sending the craziest... It's the craziest shit I've ever seen.
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.460]  It's a practical joke where you look at the top and go, that looks great. And then you go in an inch and it's a problem.
[38:22.900 --> 38:25.620]  See, that looks like fucking dried up guacamole.
[38:26.200 --> 38:27.440]  It's mushy peas.
[38:27.560 --> 38:28.980]  It's mashed potatoes.
[38:29.280 --> 38:31.380]  It's green mashed potatoes. It's some green...
[38:31.380 --> 38:33.880]  That's some Dr. Seuss mashed potatoes.
[38:34.800 --> 38:38.480]  I would love to lay out, like, a nice, like, fajita meal.
[38:38.880 --> 38:43.980]  And just replace all the ingredients with different British shit so, like, you go for the guac and it's peas.
[38:45.100 --> 38:46.140]  Oh, so sad.
[38:46.720 --> 38:47.220]  Oh, man.
[38:47.320 --> 38:47.860]  Oh, that's so sad.
[38:48.420 --> 38:48.920]  Okay.
[38:49.260 --> 38:49.320]  Terrible.
[38:49.660 --> 38:52.760]  Well, I feel like we're leaning apple pie, which is...
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.160]  I think apple pie is the standard.
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.760]  I think apple pie is regulation. I think that's it.
[38:56.880 --> 38:57.200]  Okay.
[38:57.540 --> 38:59.620]  We've locked in regulation pie.
[39:00.280 --> 39:00.500]  Okay.
[39:00.600 --> 39:02.680]  And I think we've... I mean, we're at 40 minutes.
[39:02.840 --> 39:03.480]  That's like...
[39:03.920 --> 39:05.420]  Let's do one more. I want to do one more.
[39:05.500 --> 39:05.640]  Okay.
[39:05.720 --> 39:06.600]  I want to do one more. Yeah.
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.260]  Because I feel like we're going to finish strong.
[39:08.500 --> 39:10.360]  I picked pie because I knew we were going to argue about it.
[39:11.240 --> 39:12.120]  I had it in my notes.
[39:12.460 --> 39:13.680]  Savory pie is an alternative.
[39:14.360 --> 39:15.960]  But I thought that it wouldn't be needed.
[39:16.260 --> 39:19.500]  And also that Gavin would be the only one that has an opinion on savory pie.
[39:20.320 --> 39:20.640]  Uh...
[39:20.640 --> 39:20.800]  Yep.
[39:20.960 --> 39:23.040]  Although, Nick, I bet you're fucking Nick. Food freak.
[39:23.040 --> 39:24.300]  Oh, I bet Nick is probably...
[39:24.300 --> 39:27.080]  Nick's going to come back and look at the pictures that we posted
[39:27.080 --> 39:29.440]  and he's going to go, ooh, for like 15 minutes.
[39:29.860 --> 39:31.740]  Yeah, he's going to be like, ooh, what did I miss?
[39:31.800 --> 39:32.440]  Let's do it again.
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.780]  This is his worst fear.
[39:34.960 --> 39:36.320]  He missed the thing about food.
[39:37.920 --> 39:40.900]  Uh, we got burgers or action heroes.
[39:41.980 --> 39:42.380]  Um...
[39:42.380 --> 39:43.060]  You want to keep it food?
[39:43.520 --> 39:44.680]  Let's keep it food.
[39:44.820 --> 39:45.000]  Okay.
[39:45.200 --> 39:45.620]  Let's keep it food.
[39:45.620 --> 39:46.500]  Go all food this episode.
[39:47.060 --> 39:47.300]  Yep.
[39:48.220 --> 39:48.620]  Burger...
[39:48.620 --> 39:49.640]  Okay, so what...
[39:49.640 --> 39:50.800]  I'm like the hot dog.
[39:50.880 --> 39:53.080]  I feel like there's room for conversation about the bun.
[39:53.740 --> 39:54.880]  What type of bun are we talking?
[39:55.180 --> 39:56.340]  We talking a pretzel bun?
[39:56.680 --> 39:57.940]  We talking a brioche?
[39:58.200 --> 39:59.280]  We talking a potato?
[39:59.700 --> 40:00.600]  Or a sesame?
[40:01.020 --> 40:01.640]  A sesame?
[40:01.980 --> 40:02.420]  I...
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.940]  I'm a potato bun guy.
[40:05.240 --> 40:06.500]  But I understand if...
[40:06.500 --> 40:06.680]  I agree.
[40:06.760 --> 40:08.760]  I understand if that's not where people land.
[40:09.040 --> 40:10.000]  I am...
[40:10.000 --> 40:13.980]  Especially if we're trying to come up with regulation burger.
[40:14.440 --> 40:15.800]  You know, like, what is the regulation one?
[40:15.860 --> 40:17.420]  I totally understand if it's not potato.
[40:17.420 --> 40:19.620]  See, I'm a big potato bun guy as well.
[40:19.840 --> 40:23.000]  I feel like that is the regulation burger bun.
[40:23.200 --> 40:23.620]  That...
[40:23.620 --> 40:24.380]  That is...
[40:24.380 --> 40:26.020]  That's more than just regulation.
[40:26.240 --> 40:27.340]  That's like bog standard.
[40:27.500 --> 40:27.740]  Yeah.
[40:27.840 --> 40:29.500]  Like, that is truly...
[40:29.500 --> 40:32.240]  It's just the basic white with sesame on it.
[40:32.260 --> 40:32.400]  Yeah.
[40:32.920 --> 40:33.400]  Um...
[40:33.400 --> 40:33.640]  Yeah.
[40:34.280 --> 40:35.120]  Full on.
[40:35.340 --> 40:35.760]  Full on.
[40:35.760 --> 40:36.460]  I hated that.
[40:37.640 --> 40:38.600]  But I...
[40:38.600 --> 40:40.740]  Like, in the world of bun...
[40:40.740 --> 40:44.960]  In the burger bun technology world, it's like we're going back to the 20s with that.
[40:44.960 --> 40:47.920]  There have been so many improvements over the years.
[40:48.080 --> 40:49.820]  Yeah, but they really nailed it.
[40:50.720 --> 40:53.440]  Is this the regulation hamburger?
[40:53.980 --> 40:54.940]  Or just burger?
[40:56.040 --> 40:56.700]  Oh, what?
[40:56.840 --> 40:57.900]  I don't even understand.
[40:58.060 --> 40:58.460]  What do you mean?
[40:58.580 --> 40:59.320]  Like a chicken burger?
[40:59.520 --> 41:00.200]  I'm excited to find out.
[41:00.320 --> 41:00.720]  Is that what you're saying?
[41:00.720 --> 41:03.760]  Well, because if it's regulation burger, I feel like a cheeseburger could be included.
[41:03.960 --> 41:04.860]  If it's a hamburger...
[41:04.860 --> 41:05.100]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:05.100 --> 41:08.360]  You would specify a cheeseburger if you wanted cheese.
[41:08.500 --> 41:11.280]  In my head, a cheeseburger is always the choice.
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.300]  Like, it's such a...
[41:12.300 --> 41:13.060]  That is...
[41:13.060 --> 41:15.400]  Like, when I say hamburger, I mean cheeseburger, but you're right.
[41:15.440 --> 41:16.260]  It is technically different.
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.300]  We've talked about this on 100% Eat A Lot, where Michael has said, sort of ad nauseum,
[41:22.500 --> 41:29.400]  that, like, when you say hamburger, what you mean is cheeseburger, because cheese is the default on a burger.
[41:29.500 --> 41:29.740]  Yes.
[41:29.800 --> 41:31.340]  Like, that is what it should be.
[41:31.340 --> 41:32.280]  I think that's backwards.
[41:32.820 --> 41:33.220]  Really?
[41:33.480 --> 41:37.020]  I think if you say hamburger, you mean a burger without cheese.
[41:37.300 --> 41:43.040]  I think you're technically completely right, but I just don't...
[41:43.040 --> 41:47.960]  When people lean toward more often than not, I think the expectation is cheese on the burger,
[41:48.620 --> 41:53.740]  and it's not about getting the, like, the wording totally correct.
[41:53.900 --> 41:56.940]  It's that over time, that has become the default.
[41:58.100 --> 41:59.420]  Yeah, I just feel like you would say burgers.
[41:59.420 --> 42:00.140]  Cheese on the burger.
[42:00.220 --> 42:01.640]  You wouldn't say hamburger in that case.
[42:02.260 --> 42:03.500]  If I want...
[42:03.500 --> 42:06.620]  If you said we're having burgers, they better frickin' be cheeseburgers.
[42:07.200 --> 42:07.640]  Exactly.
[42:08.260 --> 42:11.680]  If you said we're having hamburgers, I'd be like, this would be insane to assume cheese.
[42:11.680 --> 42:14.180]  Okay, so this is regulation burger.
[42:14.580 --> 42:17.380]  Let's call this regulation burger because it absolutely has cheese.
[42:17.480 --> 42:18.300]  Absolutely has cheese.
[42:18.740 --> 42:22.780]  Can I say that the idea that cheese is, like, an additional thing you pay for,
[42:22.920 --> 42:25.640]  that's, like, one of the greatest restaurant tricks.
[42:25.880 --> 42:27.820]  Like, they pulled the wool over our eyes.
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.880]  It would be like if they paid a premium for salt on fries, is the equivalency.
[42:33.100 --> 42:33.910]  Like, it's such a...
[42:34.620 --> 42:35.380]  It's immediate.
[42:36.400 --> 42:38.660]  Okay, so we're doing poppy seed.
[42:38.660 --> 42:42.700]  I'm fine with, as I said, like, I would never opt for that, but I do agree.
[42:42.960 --> 42:43.580]  That's sesame.
[42:43.960 --> 42:44.360]  Sesame.
[42:44.940 --> 42:45.820]  That's sesame seed.
[42:45.860 --> 42:46.340]  Yeah, that is sesame.
[42:46.420 --> 42:47.280]  Poppy's the black one.
[42:48.360 --> 42:48.860]  It is true.
[42:49.020 --> 42:49.180]  Yeah.
[42:50.420 --> 42:51.440]  See, that's my outrage.
[42:51.860 --> 42:53.300]  I only like those...
[42:53.300 --> 42:55.560]  See, I like the ones with the poppy seed on them.
[42:55.740 --> 42:57.640]  It's a little bit darker cut, the bun.
[42:57.800 --> 42:58.760]  Like, it's cooked a little bit more.
[42:58.820 --> 43:01.020]  That's the worst version of this.
[43:01.040 --> 43:01.520]  Oh, I disagree.
[43:01.800 --> 43:02.900]  Poppy seed bun?
[43:03.440 --> 43:03.660]  Yeah.
[43:03.800 --> 43:03.940]  Yeah.
[43:04.100 --> 43:04.680]  A poppy seed?
[43:05.340 --> 43:06.040]  See, what...
[43:06.040 --> 43:07.100]  The sesame seed is...
[43:07.100 --> 43:10.740]  That's some Burger King shit, Eric, which I'm surprised you're a fan of.
[43:12.220 --> 43:16.300]  This is just when I get a burger at, like, a cookout or whatever?
[43:16.580 --> 43:17.140]  Like, that's it.
[43:17.500 --> 43:18.720]  Like, that to me is...
[43:19.980 --> 43:20.740]  That's where we're at.
[43:20.840 --> 43:22.880]  Gavin, did you look up poppy seed bun and you're going,
[43:22.980 --> 43:24.440]  Why the fuck is he talking about this?
[43:24.620 --> 43:26.440]  I'm seeing it only on, like, long buns.
[43:27.500 --> 43:28.480]  Oh, yeah, like hot dog.
[43:28.600 --> 43:29.360]  You can get hamburger buns.
[43:30.660 --> 43:31.020]  Yeah.
[43:31.380 --> 43:33.460]  Well, that's like if you want to eat a burger the long way.
[43:36.600 --> 43:37.780]  Just put it in there.
[43:39.300 --> 43:43.780]  I wonder if a long Big Mac would be as good as just a Big Mac.
[43:44.060 --> 43:45.300]  I don't think a Big Mac is good.
[43:45.300 --> 43:48.000]  Should we try to make long hamburgers?
[43:48.200 --> 43:48.300]  Sure.
[43:48.520 --> 43:51.980]  Yeah, we should try to make long burgers and see if they're better that way.
[43:52.280 --> 43:53.700]  Oh, are we talking...
[43:54.220 --> 43:55.080]  Is it like...
[43:55.080 --> 43:57.060]  Are we making burger dogs?
[43:57.460 --> 43:58.340]  Where it's shaped like that?
[43:58.460 --> 43:58.480]  Yeah.
[43:58.480 --> 43:58.560]  Okay.
[43:58.640 --> 43:58.820]  Yeah.
[43:58.980 --> 44:01.660]  And not like smash burgers where it's long but then extended.
[44:02.180 --> 44:04.940]  We got to try to keep some layers.
[44:05.080 --> 44:05.680]  We called those...
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.280]  At Mega64, I think we called them hot burgers.
[44:10.300 --> 44:17.800]  And then the other one, I think we called ham bogs.
[44:18.140 --> 44:21.620]  So that way you wouldn't get too confused.
[44:22.920 --> 44:26.340]  So that way you knew about ham bogs and hot burgers.
[44:26.520 --> 44:27.600]  It's type of bun I'm talking about.
[44:27.600 --> 44:29.160]  I feel like...
[44:30.320 --> 44:32.500]  I feel like as soon as you said ham...
[44:32.500 --> 44:33.400]  What did you say? Ham bog?
[44:34.120 --> 44:35.180]  Yeah, ham bogs.
[44:35.240 --> 44:39.120]  I feel like my understanding of all the visuals in my head just exploded.
[44:39.400 --> 44:42.540]  I lost my holdings of everything.
[44:42.700 --> 44:44.480]  I just completely lost what we were talking about.
[44:44.840 --> 44:45.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[44:45.520 --> 44:47.460]  We're talking about ham bogs and hot burgers.
[44:51.100 --> 44:51.480]  Okay.
[44:51.920 --> 44:52.920]  So we have the bun.
[44:53.420 --> 44:54.000]  We have the core.
[44:54.280 --> 44:55.180]  Cheese we agree on.
[44:55.320 --> 44:56.060]  But what type of cheese?
[44:56.140 --> 44:56.920]  Are we talking a cheddar?
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.760]  I personally like mozzarella, but I think a cheddar is probably...
[45:00.760 --> 45:03.840]  I think it's just got to be a shitty American slice, isn't it?
[45:03.860 --> 45:05.100]  I think it's American.
[45:05.300 --> 45:06.600]  I think it has to be American cheese.
[45:06.700 --> 45:07.460]  It's the meltiest.
[45:09.100 --> 45:10.200]  I also think...
[45:10.200 --> 45:11.940]  I'm going to just take a swing and say...
[45:14.160 --> 45:16.880]  And I don't think you guys are going to agree, but I guess we'll see where it stands.
[45:18.020 --> 45:22.860]  Onion and tomato are both going on what I think is a standard hamburger.
[45:23.040 --> 45:23.720]  What do you think?
[45:24.580 --> 45:25.400]  I would say...
[45:25.400 --> 45:27.240]  I would have said onion, tomato and lettuce.
[45:27.600 --> 45:30.700]  So I think lettuce is fine.
[45:31.060 --> 45:32.600]  I don't think it adds anything.
[45:32.800 --> 45:33.900]  And if I'm saying...
[45:33.900 --> 45:36.480]  Like, if I have a say in this thing, I'll get that out of here.
[45:36.800 --> 45:40.400]  I'm fine if you guys want it, but like, I just don't think...
[45:40.400 --> 45:41.220]  I don't think you need it.
[45:41.300 --> 45:44.300]  Lettuce to me is like the burger thumbnail, though.
[45:44.440 --> 45:48.960]  It's like it makes it look slightly more appetizing, even though it has minimal impact on the meal.
[45:48.960 --> 45:49.580]  It is the garnish.
[45:49.740 --> 45:49.840]  Yeah.
[45:51.280 --> 45:53.700]  Although sometimes you can get a little too thick with the lettuce.
[45:53.700 --> 45:54.900]  And it's like I'm eating a salad.
[45:55.200 --> 45:55.240]  I agree.
[45:55.360 --> 45:56.020]  And it's slimy.
[45:57.120 --> 45:57.440]  Yep.
[45:57.740 --> 45:59.080]  That's where I'm coming from with it.
[45:59.160 --> 46:00.620]  Where you get like...
[46:00.620 --> 46:04.280]  Someone just gets like the one lettuce leaf and they just throw it on there.
[46:04.380 --> 46:05.160]  And it's all slippy.
[46:05.420 --> 46:08.040]  And it's just like, no, I want like the bib lettuce.
[46:08.360 --> 46:10.540]  Like, put a couple of slices on there.
[46:10.620 --> 46:11.220]  It's nice.
[46:11.300 --> 46:13.980]  And it adds like a little something to it.
[46:14.160 --> 46:15.500]  But I'm fine.
[46:15.540 --> 46:16.640]  We can have lettuce on this thing.
[46:16.680 --> 46:17.120]  I'm not opposed.
[46:17.140 --> 46:17.880]  I like lettuce.
[46:17.900 --> 46:18.720]  I like onion.
[46:18.860 --> 46:19.560]  I don't like tomato.
[46:19.840 --> 46:20.620]  That is where I stand.
[46:21.340 --> 46:25.740]  But I do agree that the tomato I feel like is a part of the burger.
[46:26.840 --> 46:26.960]  Okay.
[46:27.140 --> 46:27.640]  I want...
[46:28.540 --> 46:31.160]  If it's a little bit of a give and take here, then I want no pickles.
[46:31.600 --> 46:32.660]  Oh, I'm fine with that.
[46:32.820 --> 46:33.560]  Get the fucking...
[46:33.560 --> 46:33.920]  Okay, cool.
[46:33.940 --> 46:34.800]  You don't even see them.
[46:35.320 --> 46:35.980]  Get them out of there.
[46:36.160 --> 46:36.420]  No.
[46:36.980 --> 46:40.640]  I hate them, but I feel like stuff like a Big Mac without a gherkin...
[46:41.240 --> 46:42.180]  Oh, you hate gherkins.
[46:42.200 --> 46:44.280]  Oh, I hate pickles.
[46:44.680 --> 46:47.340]  How the fuck do you hate pickles but like Branston pickle?
[46:47.800 --> 46:49.100]  How is this possible?
[46:49.540 --> 46:50.340]  It's not...
[46:50.340 --> 46:52.300]  Branston has other pickle shit.
[46:52.480 --> 46:53.180]  It's like onion.
[46:53.560 --> 46:54.860]  It's other shit.
[46:55.040 --> 46:56.960]  There are no pickles in Branston pickle?
[46:57.660 --> 46:57.820]  Yeah.
[46:58.320 --> 46:59.280]  There has to be pickles.
[46:59.280 --> 47:00.220]  It's not all cucumber.
[47:01.460 --> 47:02.340]  That's insane.
[47:02.620 --> 47:03.720]  That is an insane taste preference.
[47:04.060 --> 47:05.340]  I'm with Gavin on this.
[47:05.600 --> 47:09.200]  I pickle my own onions at home and they go on like everything.
[47:09.260 --> 47:09.940]  No, totally fair.
[47:10.500 --> 47:11.040]  Yeah, absolutely.
[47:11.300 --> 47:12.880]  I just think pickles are...
[47:12.880 --> 47:13.420]  I think pickles...
[47:14.060 --> 47:15.520]  The actual pickle is vile.
[47:15.580 --> 47:18.560]  I think it's stupid to call something a process.
[47:19.000 --> 47:19.500]  Okay.
[47:19.500 --> 47:20.560]  I agree.
[47:21.860 --> 47:25.400]  Unless we change the name of beer to fermentation.
[47:26.120 --> 47:27.260]  Then I'm okay with it.
[47:27.920 --> 47:30.720]  I'm just trying to wrap my head around because I agree with everything you're saying.
[47:30.820 --> 47:34.060]  But the fact you love Branston pickles is really what holds me up.
[47:34.060 --> 47:34.720]  It's a different veg.
[47:35.020 --> 47:35.540]  It's different.
[47:36.340 --> 47:38.080]  That's a jar of pickle, right?
[47:38.180 --> 47:38.860]  It's not a pickle.
[47:39.020 --> 47:40.760]  But there are pickles in Branston pickle.
[47:41.360 --> 47:42.700]  They're a small part of the pie.
[47:42.860 --> 47:43.840]  But it's all different.
[47:43.960 --> 47:46.360]  It's all like obliterated by the pickling process.
[47:46.460 --> 47:48.840]  Gavin can tell you all about different kinds of pie.
[47:48.840 --> 47:49.860]  Well, so wait.
[47:50.200 --> 47:51.860]  If it was a pickled pickle...
[47:52.420 --> 47:53.320]  Would you be...
[47:53.320 --> 47:54.280]  Would you enjoy that?
[47:55.040 --> 47:55.920]  What do you mean a pickled pickle?
[47:56.100 --> 47:56.780]  What are you talking about?
[47:56.800 --> 47:57.580]  A cucumber, you mean?
[47:57.600 --> 47:58.620]  Well, if you pickle a pickle.
[47:59.220 --> 47:59.840]  If you pickle a cucumber...
[47:59.840 --> 48:00.940]  What are you talking about, pickle a pickle?
[48:01.020 --> 48:02.120]  If you pickle a cucumber...
[48:02.120 --> 48:03.020]  Silly bollocks.
[48:05.140 --> 48:05.900]  Boys, boys!
[48:06.020 --> 48:06.960]  Save it for the podcast!
[48:09.040 --> 48:10.780]  Like a spoonful of pickle.
[48:10.900 --> 48:11.460]  It looks like that.
[48:11.900 --> 48:12.660]  Oh, that's awful.
[48:12.960 --> 48:13.960]  Don't show me that.
[48:14.280 --> 48:15.960]  That looks like more dog food.
[48:16.440 --> 48:18.100]  It looks like stuff you feed a dog.
[48:18.100 --> 48:20.280]  Why is it next to a piece of rolled ham?
[48:20.740 --> 48:22.160]  What's happening in this picture?
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.400]  They're probably cooking up a lovely plowman's.
[48:26.380 --> 48:29.000]  Stop finding plowman's everywhere, too.
[48:29.300 --> 48:29.980]  It's been terrible.
[48:30.540 --> 48:32.840]  I went to Waitrose yesterday and I bought a plowman's.
[48:34.320 --> 48:35.740]  I bought a plowman's sandwich.
[48:38.140 --> 48:41.540]  But that's like an original plowman's lunch, probably.
[48:41.720 --> 48:44.200]  Just like a layout of all the different stuff.
[48:44.200 --> 48:45.160]  That spoon.
[48:45.420 --> 48:49.780]  That looks like you have, I don't know, like the plague or something.
[48:49.900 --> 48:50.700]  And that's the cure.
[48:50.840 --> 48:52.620]  That's the remedy that they're trying to give you.
[48:53.160 --> 48:56.380]  I like cubes of glistening sludge.
[48:56.540 --> 48:58.620]  Yeah, you definitely do.
[48:58.820 --> 48:59.780]  Anyway, back on topic.
[49:01.260 --> 49:02.220]  That looks great.
[49:02.840 --> 49:04.160]  I just sent an image of a burger.
[49:05.220 --> 49:07.080]  Now, here's the thing.
[49:07.740 --> 49:10.540]  Condiment-wise on the bottom here, it looks like it might be ketchup or something.
[49:10.540 --> 49:15.060]  I think if there's going to be a condiment, it should probably be Thousand Island.
[49:15.500 --> 49:15.860]  No.
[49:16.240 --> 49:16.560]  What?
[49:16.760 --> 49:17.120]  No.
[49:17.480 --> 49:17.720]  Yeah.
[49:17.780 --> 49:18.120]  No.
[49:18.280 --> 49:18.860]  Are you an idiot?
[49:19.020 --> 49:20.640]  No, we're not doing Thousand Island.
[49:22.460 --> 49:23.480]  That's an insane...
[49:23.480 --> 49:24.440]  What should be on it?
[49:24.600 --> 49:24.900]  Anything.
[49:25.280 --> 49:27.200]  Like, see, I don't like the Big Mac at all.
[49:27.280 --> 49:28.640]  I'm not a fan of the Thousand Island.
[49:29.000 --> 49:33.660]  I'm okay with like a mayo, like an aioli or a mayo mixture.
[49:33.660 --> 49:34.020]  I'm fine with a mayo.
[49:34.260 --> 49:35.020]  I can live with a mayo.
[49:35.580 --> 49:37.480]  I don't love it, but I can live with a mayo.
[49:37.580 --> 49:38.560]  I typically would do...
[49:39.140 --> 49:39.820]  I don't...
[49:39.820 --> 49:40.620]  Yeah, I don't know.
[49:41.360 --> 49:43.820]  Mustard feels weird to me on that, but so does ketchup.
[49:43.960 --> 49:44.580]  I don't typically...
[49:45.220 --> 49:47.920]  It's not a burger I would typically eat, but it looks very appetizing.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.920]  I think we got to go aioli or like a mayo or something.
[49:53.020 --> 49:55.400]  Yeah, I think mayo is fair.
[49:55.560 --> 49:56.260]  Gavin, what do you think?
[49:56.780 --> 49:58.520]  Probably go ketchup over mayo, to be honest.
[49:58.580 --> 49:59.140]  What about an aioli?
[49:59.560 --> 50:00.760]  What about like a garlic aioli?
[50:01.480 --> 50:03.580]  Yeah, I mean, that just depends...
[50:03.580 --> 50:05.420]  That's how fancy the burger is, right?
[50:05.460 --> 50:08.120]  Like, if I'm making these on my grill, I'd probably...
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.540]  I'm probably just slinging some ketchup in it.
[50:10.760 --> 50:11.280]  Yeah.
[50:11.480 --> 50:15.340]  But I would rather have an aioli of some sort.
[50:15.740 --> 50:16.140]  Now here's...
[50:17.020 --> 50:18.380]  Here's where I can...
[50:18.380 --> 50:20.420]  I'll say aioli is fine.
[50:20.580 --> 50:22.680]  Like, I think that that's just dressed up mayonnaise.
[50:22.920 --> 50:23.720]  I don't mind it.
[50:23.840 --> 50:24.280]  It's fine.
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.640]  If we're doing the style of hamburger, I will always go smash burger.
[50:31.400 --> 50:32.180]  Ooh, yeah.
[50:32.540 --> 50:33.380]  I'm a big...
[50:33.380 --> 50:33.500]  That thinner...
[50:33.500 --> 50:34.780]  Yeah, I like smash burger.
[50:35.700 --> 50:36.920]  I love it.
[50:36.920 --> 50:38.620]  I love that type of...
[50:38.620 --> 50:47.100]  If the burgers are squashed like that and the bread's all mushy and it's wrapped in a bag that's gone transparent because of all the grease, I hate it.
[50:47.800 --> 50:48.240]  Really?
[50:48.640 --> 50:50.940]  That is like so my preferred burger?
[50:51.380 --> 50:53.140]  Like, that picture that I sent?
[50:53.360 --> 50:53.520]  No.
[50:53.960 --> 50:54.320]  Way better.
[50:54.440 --> 50:55.920]  The one that I sent?
[50:56.060 --> 50:56.620]  Oh, my God.
[50:56.780 --> 50:58.060]  Like, give me that now.
[50:58.240 --> 50:59.060]  I'll eat ten.
[50:59.340 --> 50:59.680]  Like, let's...
[50:59.680 --> 51:01.820]  You're gonna have such wet hands after.
[51:02.280 --> 51:02.940]  Yeah, I...
[51:03.540 --> 51:06.900]  And I will suffer those blows to eat that burger.
[51:06.900 --> 51:13.260]  And if you're wearing long sleeves, chances are when you're holding it upright towards the mouth, it's gonna go down your damn sleeves, all that juice.
[51:14.220 --> 51:15.080]  That's a good point.
[51:15.440 --> 51:16.200]  Here's the problem.
[51:16.500 --> 51:18.560]  I feel like we're too late to swap to a smash burger.
[51:18.900 --> 51:21.180]  Because I would change the design of all the...
[51:21.260 --> 51:25.080]  Like, everything structurally is different to me if we're going smash.
[51:25.460 --> 51:26.440]  I don't want anything.
[51:26.640 --> 51:27.260]  I don't want lettuce.
[51:27.500 --> 51:28.160]  I don't want tomato.
[51:28.700 --> 51:33.520]  I'm purely there for the...
[51:33.520 --> 51:35.400]  See, that looks fine to me.
[51:35.880 --> 51:36.140]  Okay.
[51:36.480 --> 51:36.760]  Okay.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.180]  So, something that's a little bit thicker.
[51:38.320 --> 51:39.000]  I just don't...
[51:39.000 --> 51:40.440]  I'm so over...
[51:40.440 --> 51:48.780]  My whole life was eating these thick hamburger puck things that were just never...
[51:48.780 --> 51:49.320]  Sure.
[51:49.660 --> 51:51.540]  Altogether, like, came out right.
[51:51.560 --> 51:51.880]  Yeah.
[51:52.080 --> 51:52.540]  Dry.
[51:52.780 --> 51:53.080]  Some pieces are moist.
[51:53.080 --> 51:56.340]  And I just always go for a thinner burger because I...
[51:56.340 --> 51:58.340]  To me, it's cooked better all the way through.
[51:58.640 --> 51:59.340]  I'm fine with that.
[51:59.620 --> 52:00.140]  Like, I'm...
[52:00.140 --> 52:00.720]  Yeah, let's...
[52:00.720 --> 52:01.520]  Do we just clarify?
[52:01.520 --> 52:03.040]  Do we just clarify it's not a giant meat patty?
[52:03.140 --> 52:04.180]  Just, like, a small...
[52:04.180 --> 52:04.440]  Yes.
[52:04.440 --> 52:06.140]  Like, a normal sized...
[52:06.140 --> 52:06.820]  Not insane.
[52:08.100 --> 52:08.720]  Because I...
[52:08.720 --> 52:09.360]  That works.
[52:10.260 --> 52:10.640]  For me.
[52:10.860 --> 52:13.900]  I think it's just something on the thinner side, but not...
[52:13.900 --> 52:14.820]  Now, you said...
[52:14.820 --> 52:17.720]  You described aioli as just mayo in a disguise.
[52:18.080 --> 52:19.380]  That's what I need for my mayo.
[52:19.440 --> 52:20.840]  I can't handle...
[52:20.840 --> 52:20.960]  Okay.
[52:20.960 --> 52:22.380]  I fucking hate mayo.
[52:23.180 --> 52:23.820]  But if it's...
[52:23.820 --> 52:23.860]  Oh, okay.
[52:23.860 --> 52:26.760]  If I don't know it's there or I don't see it, I like it a lot.
[52:26.840 --> 52:27.040]  Uh-huh.
[52:27.480 --> 52:27.960]  But I can't...
[52:27.960 --> 52:29.740]  I'm pretty sure he said dressed up mayo.
[52:29.740 --> 52:31.260]  Not mayo, like, wearing a mask.
[52:31.260 --> 52:31.460]  Whatever.
[52:31.760 --> 52:32.420]  I didn't remember.
[52:32.640 --> 52:35.640]  I just knew the idea was that it was mayo fancied up.
[52:35.780 --> 52:36.900]  And that's what I need for my mayo.
[52:37.060 --> 52:37.360]  It is.
[52:37.500 --> 52:38.900]  I can't just have base mayo.
[52:39.300 --> 52:42.280]  If I do have it, I need it to be hidden in the dish.
[52:42.780 --> 52:43.640]  And then I'll be fine.
[52:43.860 --> 52:44.720]  What about salad cream?
[52:45.420 --> 52:45.820]  I...
[52:45.820 --> 52:46.020]  Ugh.
[52:47.220 --> 52:48.020]  I don't...
[52:48.560 --> 52:53.780]  Honestly, when I did the Branston popsicle thing, that was so bad that it has, like,
[52:53.920 --> 52:58.460]  overtaken all the other flavors that I've tried that you've recommended over the years.
[52:58.460 --> 52:59.620]  So I don't remember if I...
[52:59.620 --> 53:03.000]  But you never had normal Branston in a normal situation, though.
[53:03.220 --> 53:03.800]  Did I not?
[53:03.900 --> 53:05.520]  Did I not just have hot Branston?
[53:06.200 --> 53:07.180]  I think I did, didn't I?
[53:07.700 --> 53:08.220]  It's not...
[53:08.220 --> 53:09.040]  Why would you have it hot?
[53:09.260 --> 53:09.540]  Hot?
[53:09.940 --> 53:10.780]  Oh, no, Branston pickle.
[53:10.980 --> 53:11.380]  No, no, no.
[53:11.420 --> 53:12.720]  Sorry, I'm thinking the...
[53:12.720 --> 53:13.080]  The...
[53:13.080 --> 53:13.280]  Whatever.
[53:13.460 --> 53:14.220]  The meat.
[53:14.580 --> 53:14.940]  Bovril.
[53:15.620 --> 53:16.440]  That's what I was thinking.
[53:17.180 --> 53:20.520]  When I had the Bovril popsicle, that's really, like...
[53:20.520 --> 53:22.820]  That was such a bad experience that...
[53:22.820 --> 53:25.340]  Yeah, you salad creamed the Bovril.
[53:25.900 --> 53:27.860]  But I think I had Bovril normally as well.
[53:28.200 --> 53:30.120]  But did you have Branston pickle normally?
[53:30.160 --> 53:30.680]  I can't even remember.
[53:30.880 --> 53:31.820]  Yeah, I had it on toast.
[53:31.920 --> 53:33.200]  I had it the way that you suggested.
[53:33.340 --> 53:34.360]  I had it on, like, a...
[53:34.360 --> 53:34.700]  Toast?
[53:35.080 --> 53:37.040]  I had it on bread with cheese or something.
[53:37.320 --> 53:38.180]  Oh, yeah, cheese sandwich.
[53:38.360 --> 53:38.680]  Classic.
[53:39.300 --> 53:40.600]  I followed your instructions.
[53:40.860 --> 53:42.140]  I can't believe you had it on toast!
[53:42.240 --> 53:42.740]  There was cheese.
[53:42.880 --> 53:43.800]  Oh, then fuck yeah!
[53:44.020 --> 53:44.740]  Well, it wasn't toast.
[53:44.840 --> 53:46.320]  It should have just been bread and cheese and Branston.
[53:46.320 --> 53:46.660]  No, no, it wasn't toasted.
[53:47.040 --> 53:47.440]  I just...
[53:47.440 --> 53:48.400]  It was a long time ago.
[53:48.480 --> 53:50.980]  I remember, though, I specifically asked you how do I eat this.
[53:51.240 --> 53:52.860]  Because I wanted a fair testing.
[53:53.540 --> 53:54.420]  Was not a fan.
[53:54.420 --> 53:58.100]  I think salad cream I was okay with, but it's sort of just gross.
[54:01.020 --> 54:02.440]  Anyway, I need an aioli.
[54:02.580 --> 54:03.480]  I want a garlic aioli.
[54:03.640 --> 54:04.360]  Would be my preference.
[54:04.540 --> 54:04.960]  I understand.
[54:05.200 --> 54:05.680]  That's fine.
[54:05.860 --> 54:06.280]  I can...
[54:06.280 --> 54:07.120]  I'm totally fine with that.
[54:07.120 --> 54:08.320]  I need that disguise on that mayo.
[54:08.860 --> 54:09.220]  Okay.
[54:09.500 --> 54:11.260]  But is that part of the regulation, Burger?
[54:11.260 --> 54:12.500]  You think it's going to be aioli?
[54:12.780 --> 54:14.180]  Well, we get to set the regulation.
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.720]  That's why I'm trying to get it over to Thousand Island.
[54:16.840 --> 54:17.860]  A very acceptable thing.
[54:18.000 --> 54:18.820]  There's no...
[54:18.820 --> 54:19.080]  That's fine.
[54:19.100 --> 54:22.220]  Thousand Island, I feel like, is weirder than a garlic aioli.
[54:22.840 --> 54:23.460]  You're nuts.
[54:23.460 --> 54:26.280]  I feel like Thousand Island is just very American.
[54:26.660 --> 54:28.220]  See, maybe that is...
[54:28.300 --> 54:29.140]  That could just be...
[54:29.140 --> 54:31.820]  Yeah, for me, I've never experienced that outside of McDonald's.
[54:32.800 --> 54:33.360]  I'm right.
[54:33.460 --> 54:33.860]  It's okay.
[54:33.980 --> 54:35.580]  But we can go garlic aioli or whatever.
[54:35.780 --> 54:36.060]  That's fine.
[54:36.140 --> 54:36.580]  Do we need...
[54:36.580 --> 54:37.780]  Is there anything else that we're missing?
[54:37.920 --> 54:38.560]  No pickle?
[54:38.720 --> 54:39.420]  Are we all in agreement?
[54:39.500 --> 54:39.900]  No pickle?
[54:40.020 --> 54:40.920]  I feel good about...
[54:40.920 --> 54:41.500]  With the onion?
[54:41.640 --> 54:42.740]  I feel good about what we got.
[54:42.780 --> 54:43.040]  I'm honest.
[54:43.120 --> 54:46.640]  I'm looking at that first burger you posted, and I'm imagining it being a little less thick,
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.360]  but like five.
[54:47.800 --> 54:48.520]  That's a good looking burger.
[54:48.560 --> 54:50.240]  I mean, that's it to me.
[54:50.560 --> 54:52.040]  It's that image of that burger.
[54:52.040 --> 54:54.960]  But two patties, a little less.
[54:55.080 --> 54:58.120]  I got a little wrinkle I'd like to throw in as a personal preference.
[54:58.420 --> 54:59.060]  Looking at it.
[54:59.440 --> 55:01.480]  What if we swap the onion with onion ring?
[55:01.720 --> 55:02.900]  How do we feel about that?
[55:03.720 --> 55:05.520]  I like the cold crunchy onion.
[55:06.040 --> 55:06.360]  Me too.
[55:06.440 --> 55:07.540]  I think it's too specialized.
[55:08.160 --> 55:08.440]  Fair enough.
[55:08.460 --> 55:13.760]  And the fried part of the onion ring can often sit too long and absorb too much and become soggy itself.
[55:14.020 --> 55:15.540]  Are we getting any bacon in this thing?
[55:16.300 --> 55:17.940]  I don't think it's a part of the regulation.
[55:18.180 --> 55:20.080]  No, not as part of the regulation.
[55:20.080 --> 55:25.640]  Okay, so the regulation burger is just a standard sesame seed bun.
[55:25.720 --> 55:26.520]  Oh, that was a burp.
[55:26.580 --> 55:36.880]  A sesame seed bun, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, basic burger, and a garlic aioli.
[55:38.000 --> 55:38.760]  I think that's it.
[55:38.860 --> 55:39.080]  Wow.
[55:39.480 --> 55:40.600]  What an episode.
[55:40.960 --> 55:42.700]  We locked in some big food texts.
[55:42.700 --> 55:44.920]  I think this is such a good idea.
[55:45.320 --> 55:47.680]  And now we're never going to hear the fucking end of it from Jack.
[55:47.680 --> 55:53.440]  We just went through a bunch of foods, made decisions without him, and he's going to have a lot to say.
[55:53.520 --> 55:54.040]  Well, we got a majority.
[55:54.180 --> 55:58.400]  You know, the regulation company, we have a majority system for all of our decisions.
[55:58.440 --> 55:59.520]  It's too bad he wasn't here.
[56:00.100 --> 56:00.680]  He was invited.
[56:00.860 --> 56:06.420]  But do you really think that people, when they think of a regulation burger, will put garlic aioli?
[56:06.920 --> 56:09.880]  No, again, I think it's Thousand Island, but you guys won't listen.
[56:10.080 --> 56:10.780]  I think it's ketchup.
[56:11.320 --> 56:11.980]  It's not ketchup.
[56:12.560 --> 56:13.460]  Eric hates ketchup.
[56:14.320 --> 56:16.160]  I think it's a compromise, Gavin.
[56:16.320 --> 56:17.580]  We're coming to a compromise here.
[56:17.580 --> 56:19.280]  I think this is a world in which we're all happy.
[56:20.020 --> 56:21.140]  Are you not happy with it?
[56:21.580 --> 56:22.420]  I mean, I would eat that.
[56:22.500 --> 56:25.640]  But I'm just saying, a lot of people are just like, oh, let's make burgers tonight.
[56:25.740 --> 56:28.180]  Yeah, I'll get the buns, I'll get the, you know, the meat.
[56:28.460 --> 56:29.920]  And then it's just whatever you have in the fridge.
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.740]  And what you have in the fridge is probably going to be ketchup.
[56:32.020 --> 56:34.560]  It's probably not going to be Thousand Island or garlic aioli.
[56:35.060 --> 56:36.300]  Oh, I got Thousand Island in the fridge.
[56:36.380 --> 56:37.580]  I got garlic aioli in the fridge.
[56:38.420 --> 56:38.800]  All right.
[56:39.260 --> 56:39.980]  All right, I'm wrong.
[56:40.240 --> 56:41.320]  No, I don't think you're necessarily wrong.
[56:41.600 --> 56:46.220]  If you feel strongly, I mean, we could hash it out more, but I felt like we had a good compromise.
[56:46.220 --> 56:48.760]  No, I think I think we landed on it.
[56:48.800 --> 56:49.240]  I think we're OK.
[56:49.380 --> 56:50.120]  We landed on it.
[56:50.560 --> 56:50.960]  All right.
[56:51.280 --> 56:52.120]  Because I love ketchup.
[56:52.220 --> 56:54.780]  But like, listen, if you want to go ketchup, I would go.
[56:54.880 --> 56:57.020]  But I think garlic aioli is the thing.
[56:58.200 --> 56:58.720]  What's for me?
[56:58.820 --> 57:00.600]  OK, well, we got the burger locked in.
[57:00.660 --> 57:02.040]  We got what do we got?
[57:02.080 --> 57:03.000]  Hot dog locked in.
[57:03.040 --> 57:04.200]  We got pie locked in.
[57:04.700 --> 57:05.400]  French fry.
[57:05.560 --> 57:06.160]  It's crazy.
[57:07.080 --> 57:08.480]  So OK, so let's just go through it all.
[57:08.980 --> 57:09.600]  Hot dog.
[57:10.640 --> 57:15.800]  Bun, plain bun, normal dog, ketchup and a mustard of your choice.
[57:15.800 --> 57:16.840]  Any variety.
[57:17.700 --> 57:19.940]  French fry is like the standard cut fry with salt.
[57:20.080 --> 57:20.780]  Very basic.
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.900]  Like, I think that's an easy, very accessible thing.
[57:23.480 --> 57:25.820]  Then we got pie, which is apple pie.
[57:25.940 --> 57:27.720]  Once again, I feel incredibly accessible.
[57:28.320 --> 57:29.520]  My personal favorite pie.
[57:29.680 --> 57:30.580]  Very excited about that.
[57:31.120 --> 57:38.160]  And the burger is sesame seed, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, garlic aioli.
[57:38.740 --> 57:39.340]  What a meal.
[57:39.740 --> 57:40.660]  What a cookout.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.720]  Garlic, garlic aioli, Gavin.
[57:43.120 --> 57:43.780]  Garlic aioli.
[57:43.780 --> 57:46.000]  Listen, Eric, you want it to be ketchup?
[57:46.460 --> 57:47.740]  I'll fight on the ketchup train.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.100]  Nope, garlic aioli it is, baby.
[57:50.220 --> 57:50.700]  I'm going to lock that in.
[57:51.400 --> 57:52.020]  Thank you.
[57:52.260 --> 57:52.860]  Is that sold?
[57:53.320 --> 57:55.320]  Is there like a Heinz garlic aioli?
[57:55.460 --> 57:55.860]  Yeah, there is.
[57:56.280 --> 57:56.980]  Absolutely is.
[57:57.540 --> 57:58.040]  Show it to me.
[57:58.220 --> 57:58.900]  OK, one sec.
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.320]  Let me find a photo of it.
[58:01.620 --> 58:06.320]  Do you see that Heinz just did the 15 dressings in one as like a promotion?
[58:06.700 --> 58:07.740]  Oh yeah, I heard about that.
[58:07.840 --> 58:08.600]  The everything dressing.
[58:09.140 --> 58:10.520]  Damn, I might buy this.
[58:11.660 --> 58:12.320]  Oh, wow.
[58:12.420 --> 58:12.980]  It's awesome.
[58:12.980 --> 58:13.420]  I might.
[58:13.500 --> 58:14.240]  Yeah, that's what I have.
[58:14.320 --> 58:14.680]  I might.
[58:14.860 --> 58:15.200]  It's great.
[58:15.400 --> 58:16.160]  Yeah, I might buy that.
[58:16.260 --> 58:16.460]  It's delicious.
[58:16.500 --> 58:17.100]  That looks fucking.
[58:17.460 --> 58:19.900]  That genuinely looks really good.
[58:19.980 --> 58:20.120]  I might.
[58:20.340 --> 58:20.520]  It's good.
[58:20.660 --> 58:22.140]  I think I should start keeping this on hand.
[58:22.420 --> 58:22.540]  You should.
[58:22.760 --> 58:23.280]  Yeah, me too.
[58:23.460 --> 58:23.760]  I might.
[58:23.980 --> 58:27.000]  Hey, our lives might be different from this point on.
[58:27.100 --> 58:27.780]  It's pretty interesting.
[58:28.420 --> 58:31.640]  See, that's like, I don't know what you're imagining, but that is what I have.
[58:31.720 --> 58:33.940]  It's just a squeeze bottle of Heinz aioli.
[58:34.860 --> 58:36.380]  I think that's just really fancy.
[58:36.580 --> 58:38.520]  I just didn't grow up in that kind of household.
[58:38.760 --> 58:39.460]  No, me neither.
[58:39.600 --> 58:39.880]  I agree.
[58:39.880 --> 58:42.980]  Yeah, this is something I like have recently gotten into.
[58:43.300 --> 58:47.200]  I think it's a relatively new product for them as well, but it's delicious.
[58:47.880 --> 58:52.380]  And we applied, we set new regulations, new standards.
[58:52.920 --> 58:54.660]  We have a rule we have set up.
[58:54.740 --> 58:58.400]  I can't, as you said, Eric, can't wait to hear Geoff's reaction, especially
[58:58.400 --> 59:02.260]  to learning that we have a regulation hot dog and burger and all that stuff.
[59:02.720 --> 59:03.740]  Thank you so much for listening.
[59:03.820 --> 59:07.880]  If you have stuff that you would like us to set regulations on,
[59:07.880 --> 59:11.520]  feel free to list that in the comments of wherever you're absorbing this.
[59:12.020 --> 59:13.080]  And check out our Patreon.
[59:13.820 --> 59:17.720]  And just to be clear with us regulating stuff and the regulation thing,
[59:17.900 --> 59:18.980]  what's the goal?
[59:19.160 --> 59:22.320]  Is it so that it's if we're setting regulations?
[59:22.580 --> 59:22.720]  Yeah.
[59:22.940 --> 59:24.700]  If they want to have a regulation burger.
[59:25.360 --> 59:25.500]  Yeah.
[59:25.880 --> 59:26.740]  They now know what it is.
[59:26.740 --> 59:26.880]  Yeah.
[59:27.660 --> 59:28.480]  Yeah, they know what it is.
[59:28.500 --> 59:29.300]  It has garlic aioli.
[59:29.380 --> 59:30.120]  It has garlic aioli.
[59:30.360 --> 59:32.740]  It doesn't have onion rings on it, which is what I'd be leaning towards.
[59:32.840 --> 59:33.660]  Absolutely insane.
[59:35.380 --> 59:36.780]  Everybody get Heinz aioli.
[59:36.780 --> 59:38.500]  I'm not sponsored by Heinz.
[59:38.680 --> 59:39.660]  Maybe I'm sponsored by Heinz.
[59:39.920 --> 59:41.160]  Anyway, check out our Patreon.
[59:42.280 --> 59:44.280]  Regulatrion.com or the regulation pod.
[59:44.620 --> 59:45.020]  Find it.
[59:45.260 --> 59:46.140]  We got YouTube channels.
[59:46.560 --> 59:47.100]  You'll find it all.
[59:47.320 --> 59:48.120]  Thank you so much for listening.
[59:48.980 --> 59:49.420]  Bye.
[59:50.060 --> 59:50.380]  Bye now.
[59:50.400 --> 59:50.660]  Bye.
