[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  How did none of us Google Regulation Store?
[00:02.540 --> 00:06.140]  Have you seen all the posts about what happens when you just Google Regulation Store?
[00:06.360 --> 00:07.960]  Why would you Google Regulation Store?
[00:07.980 --> 00:10.560]  Why would you Google it when we gave you like three URLs?
[00:10.840 --> 00:11.780]  We're not stupid.
[00:12.040 --> 00:16.220]  Yeah, we did say it was taken and we say go to regulationstore.store or regulationstore.com.
[00:16.360 --> 00:17.840]  I'm not sure why you would Google it.
[00:17.880 --> 00:19.460]  Hang on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:19.580 --> 00:23.740]  You wait, because I don't know why we would give you a URL and then you would Google it.
[00:23.840 --> 00:25.820]  Just the fact that none of us tried.
[00:25.980 --> 00:27.120]  That is how I Google things.
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.300]  Like, I am the person that would search in that way.
[00:29.300 --> 00:33.080]  And it did not cross my mind to do that.
[00:33.280 --> 00:35.100]  The point of failure in this was you.
[00:35.540 --> 00:40.320]  It's the fact that I was blindsided by the fact that when you search regulation store,
[00:40.440 --> 00:43.360]  it leads to a bondage sex shop in the UK.
[00:43.920 --> 00:46.620]  That's what a regulation store in the UK is.
[00:47.040 --> 00:47.940]  What are you going to do?
[00:48.160 --> 00:49.820]  It's that and pubs and charity shops.
