[00:00.520 --> 00:06.840]  We're gonna go ahead and play Mario Party from the regulation office.
[00:07.060 --> 00:12.780]  That's right. We got an actual space and we're here to get... Nick is just off camera.
[00:12.820 --> 00:15.720]  Sitting on the sofa that Ray and Tina gave us.
[00:15.720 --> 00:19.560]  Ray and Tina gave us. Thank you. We couldn't have done this without Ray and Tina.
[00:20.560 --> 00:22.600]  Half of our furniture came from Ray and Tina.
[00:23.120 --> 00:28.660]  Yep. We did it. We are together. We actually have a space.
[00:29.400 --> 00:32.720]  We've rented an office that we'll be using.
[00:33.280 --> 00:36.640]  We got rugs. We got rugs. Crazy. Rugs were a big part of it.
[00:36.700 --> 00:41.700]  Yeah, a lot of rugs. So if it sounds a little hollow, it's because we haven't moved all of our stuff in yet.
[00:42.180 --> 00:47.100]  We're kind of still building out. So be patient. But we did this because of your support.
[00:47.240 --> 00:53.840]  So thank you very much over the last year to be able to grow as a company and finally land on...
[00:53.840 --> 01:00.740]  Okay, I think we're at a time or a size that we need to be able to get together, not in Geoff's kitchen.
[01:01.340 --> 01:08.140]  And this also means that people can mail stuff into the P.O. Box because it won't go to your house where your wife will kill me.
[01:08.420 --> 01:12.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the P.O. Box is now officially open. Send mail to...
[01:18.600 --> 01:26.560]  22 to 40 and slip. Send mail to Regulation Company. I think it's P.O. Box 1314-6, Austin, Texas.
[01:27.260 --> 01:29.980]  Anybody know what the zip code is? I don't have it on the top of my head.
[01:30.760 --> 01:33.020]  Yeah, 1901 East 51st Street.
[01:33.100 --> 01:34.700]  No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:35.040 --> 01:35.360]  Fucking idiot.
[01:36.840 --> 01:39.680]  78701. I think it's 78701 is the zip code.
[01:39.680 --> 01:46.880]  We'll have one of the mods in the chat pin it. If you're watching on Twitch, we'll have them pin the P.O. Box.
[01:47.440 --> 01:49.540]  Cheat, send it to Rooster T3.
[01:49.780 --> 01:54.720]  All the myriad of companies I've created are spinning around in my head at all times. They all start with R.
[01:56.040 --> 02:03.100]  Anyway, so we have, I would say we rented this. We much publicized losing the office in January.
[02:03.980 --> 02:09.660]  Turned out to be a blessing in disguise because this is actually a better, in every way...
[02:09.660 --> 02:10.340]  Situation.
[02:10.620 --> 02:15.940]  We found where we could put everything really quickly. The rooms are divvied up really well.
[02:16.400 --> 02:19.760]  Honestly, do you just want to show everyone the whole space?
[02:19.780 --> 02:23.340]  Well, first off, I wanted to show, we have another guest here. I don't know where he is.
[02:23.760 --> 02:24.360]  Oh, you don't know where I am?
[02:24.360 --> 02:25.040]  He's right there.
[02:25.320 --> 02:25.980]  You don't know where I am?
[02:26.000 --> 02:26.620]  Where's Andrew?
[02:26.780 --> 02:28.560]  We have Andrew somewhere.
[02:28.780 --> 02:29.760]  Ah! Ah!
[02:30.460 --> 02:31.180]  Surprise! Surprise!
[02:31.980 --> 02:33.680]  I've been under the couch the whole time!
[02:34.020 --> 02:34.640]  You can't get me!
[02:34.640 --> 02:35.380]  Can you lift him up, please?
[02:35.420 --> 02:36.860]  I'm sinking! I'm sinking!
[02:37.100 --> 02:38.320]  Come into my arms, little Andy.
[02:38.320 --> 02:39.280]  Okay, I'm here!
[02:39.940 --> 02:40.660]  Hold me!
[02:41.140 --> 02:42.220]  Creep me tight!
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.360]  Andrew, have you discovered that you can quack and stuff?
[02:45.440 --> 02:48.520]  Oh, yeah, I can! Let me quack! Let me go crazy with the quacks!
[02:48.540 --> 02:50.760]  He barked at me earlier and scared the shit out of me.
[02:50.780 --> 02:52.340]  Bam! That's a quack!
[02:52.760 --> 02:53.860]  What the fuck?
[02:54.740 --> 02:55.760]  Bam, bam, bam!
[02:56.540 --> 02:58.660]  Nick, go back a little bit. You.
[02:58.760 --> 03:00.840]  I got my own robot, so I can run around the office!
[03:01.520 --> 03:02.380]  Go this way.
[03:02.740 --> 03:03.160]  Look at me!
[03:04.180 --> 03:04.540]  Wow!
[03:04.540 --> 03:11.000]  So, Andrew is here in robot form for all of our shenanigans.
[03:11.040 --> 03:13.140]  Now, this is the first time I'm seeing Andrew.
[03:14.460 --> 03:17.040]  Okay, Andrew, what does it look like on your end?
[03:17.700 --> 03:19.120]  Okay, what does it look like on your end?
[03:19.120 --> 03:23.260]  I got foot cam. I got a cam. It looks like I have a camera. I can see everything. It's great.
[03:23.680 --> 03:25.600]  Nick is going to be jacking off to this footage later.
[03:25.760 --> 03:26.120]  No!
[03:28.500 --> 03:31.120]  So, Andrew is here in robot form.
[03:31.760 --> 03:33.260]  We have AndrewBotOfficial.
[03:33.260 --> 03:34.780]  Wait, Andrew, come back.
[03:34.900 --> 03:36.000]  I'm coming back. I'm coming back.
[03:36.100 --> 03:37.040]  He is here.
[03:37.800 --> 03:38.280]  Here we go.
[03:38.800 --> 03:39.260]  I'm surprised.
[03:39.620 --> 03:41.780]  Yeah, man. It's a pretty meaty, beefy little...
[03:41.780 --> 03:42.940]  It's a pretty powerful little robot.
[03:43.000 --> 03:43.680]  Come on over, man.
[03:43.680 --> 03:46.860]  I had to dial the speed back. It's only at like 40% max speed.
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.380]  This is...
[03:48.380 --> 03:49.760]  Is that fast?
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.720]  This is awesome.
[03:51.160 --> 03:52.600]  This is a pet robot I saw on TikTok.
[03:52.600 --> 03:54.060]  Look at this. Look at that.
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.980]  Andrew, don't do it! Don't do it, son!
[03:59.860 --> 04:02.140]  Look at, like, Jumper.
[04:03.660 --> 04:06.780]  Oh, man. Okay.
[04:07.020 --> 04:10.380]  All right, now that we've introduced Andrew, should we take a little tour of the office?
[04:10.400 --> 04:11.060]  Let's do it!
[04:11.280 --> 04:11.480]  Let's go!
[04:13.420 --> 04:14.620]  Andrew's trying to lead the tour.
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.520]  Okay, so Nick has found a very cool way that we're able to do this.
[04:20.340 --> 04:20.500]  Okay.
[04:21.200 --> 04:22.240]  Once Gavin has it...
[04:22.240 --> 04:23.260]  Oh, you got to turn on the...
[04:23.880 --> 04:26.000]  Hang on. Andrew's gone.
[04:26.460 --> 04:28.420]  I can see him in the next room. Here it is!
[04:29.080 --> 04:29.960]  This is...
[04:29.960 --> 04:31.140]  There you go.
[04:31.560 --> 04:31.580]  There it goes.
[04:31.580 --> 04:35.020]  Okay, so this is our space to start with.
[04:35.160 --> 04:36.420]  This is our couch co-op room.
[04:36.580 --> 04:37.540]  Here it is. Happy birthday.
[04:37.780 --> 04:38.720]  Happy birthday...
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.200]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[04:41.160 --> 04:42.340]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[04:42.700 --> 04:43.780]  I fucking quit.
[04:44.000 --> 04:44.820]  You can't quit.
[04:44.940 --> 04:46.320]  I'm just going to go back and join Rooster Teeth.
[04:46.340 --> 04:46.980]  Happy birthday, Eric.
[04:47.120 --> 04:48.940]  And happy birthday, regulation.
[04:49.440 --> 04:50.220]  God damn, dude.
[04:50.500 --> 04:51.180]  That's two.
[04:51.560 --> 04:52.720]  We've got so much stuff.
[04:52.980 --> 04:56.720]  Like, do you remember the paintings that we made with the brushes in Does It Do?
[04:56.800 --> 04:57.100]  Does It Do?
[04:57.220 --> 04:58.200]  We have to hang those up soon.
[04:58.200 --> 05:00.500]  That's the brush that ended up at the top of the studio.
[05:00.500 --> 05:01.500]  We've got a...
[05:02.340 --> 05:06.000]  Yeah, so this is Nick's little impromptu setup for today's stream.
[05:06.120 --> 05:07.380]  Yeah, I was filming the crotch there a little bit.
[05:07.400 --> 05:09.280]  It'll look more professional at some point.
[05:09.420 --> 05:12.100]  I also have my laptop, so I'm bringing Andrew around with us.
[05:12.420 --> 05:13.900]  So we should be able to hear him through the laptop.
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.420]  Yeah, I can hear him through the laptop.
[05:15.620 --> 05:17.080]  So we're good here.
[05:17.700 --> 05:19.260]  This is a dump room.
[05:19.260 --> 05:19.520]  Okay.
[05:19.700 --> 05:20.560]  Over here for poos.
[05:20.700 --> 05:21.880]  This is where all the peeing and the poops happen.
[05:22.020 --> 05:22.240]  Cool.
[05:22.540 --> 05:24.040]  There's a hallway light we didn't turn on.
[05:24.280 --> 05:26.800]  Is this the toilet you clogged the other day?
[05:27.200 --> 05:27.560]  What?
[05:27.620 --> 05:28.600]  I didn't clog the toilet.
[05:28.820 --> 05:29.820]  Oh, you just wasn't enough water.
[05:29.820 --> 05:30.740]  No, that's in this room.
[05:31.660 --> 05:33.540]  This is the break room.
[05:33.980 --> 05:37.620]  So, yeah, the break room will be back at some point.
[05:37.820 --> 05:38.980]  Not for taking breaks.
[05:39.220 --> 05:39.540]  We'll be back.
[05:39.740 --> 05:40.280]  For cards.
[05:40.620 --> 05:40.780]  Yeah.
[05:41.380 --> 05:44.580]  And look at all these pre-hit baseballs we have still need to hit.
[05:44.700 --> 05:46.780]  These are pre-hit baseballs.
[05:46.820 --> 05:46.920]  Yeah.
[05:47.540 --> 05:51.440]  And then all the mail you guys sent us to Fuckface and Regulation,
[05:51.540 --> 05:53.220]  even though we asked you not to send mail to Regulation,
[05:53.420 --> 05:54.680]  that's all in here now.
[05:54.920 --> 05:56.220]  So we'll be able to...
[05:56.220 --> 05:57.020]  Yeah, there's a ton in there.
[05:57.060 --> 05:58.140]  So we'll get to all that soon.
[05:58.140 --> 05:58.520]  Yeah.
[05:58.680 --> 05:59.620]  Love the...
[06:00.080 --> 06:00.600]  Pictures of Gavin.
[06:00.920 --> 06:01.800]  Yeah, really great stuff.
[06:02.360 --> 06:05.280]  Yeah, it's obviously a lot of work to be done in this room still.
[06:05.560 --> 06:06.300]  This is the...
[06:06.300 --> 06:06.600]  All right.
[06:06.900 --> 06:09.720]  Toilet with a really shitty return.
[06:10.620 --> 06:12.080]  Takes a long time to fill that bowl.
[06:12.340 --> 06:14.280]  It doesn't take me any time to fill the bowl.
[06:14.520 --> 06:15.820]  It takes a long time for it, yeah.
[06:16.780 --> 06:17.140]  Vile.
[06:17.340 --> 06:18.720]  Then this is our main room.
[06:19.000 --> 06:20.040]  If you can't tell, we rented a house.
[06:20.220 --> 06:20.660]  We're house people.
[06:21.780 --> 06:23.720]  Whiteboard, where all the secrets are going to be.
[06:25.320 --> 06:26.040]  Over here.
[06:26.520 --> 06:27.140]  Hang on.
[06:27.800 --> 06:29.160]  This doesn't seem right.
[06:29.440 --> 06:31.560]  That's just for people who don't understand it.
[06:32.700 --> 06:33.500]  Extra small.
[06:33.640 --> 06:33.960]  Small.
[06:34.700 --> 06:34.820]  Medium.
[06:35.480 --> 06:36.180]  Extra medium.
[06:36.340 --> 06:36.800]  Back to medium.
[06:37.020 --> 06:37.420]  Medium.
[06:37.900 --> 06:38.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:38.420 --> 06:38.820]  Extra large.
[06:38.840 --> 06:40.640]  Because obviously you've got like medium here.
[06:41.120 --> 06:41.280]  So...
[06:41.280 --> 06:41.940]  And then large.
[06:42.640 --> 06:46.140]  Okay, so if it goes medium, extra medium, medium, does it go large, extra large, large?
[06:46.620 --> 06:47.260]  Why would it do that?
[06:47.720 --> 06:48.920]  Why would it do this?
[06:48.940 --> 06:52.160]  If you get larger than extra large, it would be extra, extra large.
[06:52.400 --> 06:52.960]  He's got you there.
[06:53.760 --> 06:55.240]  What's more medium than medium?
[06:55.820 --> 06:56.460]  Extra medium.
[06:56.560 --> 06:57.220]  It's right in the middle.
[06:57.340 --> 06:58.700]  You couldn't be more medium there.
[06:58.740 --> 06:59.800]  To put medium in the middle is nuts.
[07:00.240 --> 07:01.900]  So over here is our lounge area.
[07:02.120 --> 07:06.080]  You can see a little bit of the old fuckface stuff that we have going around here.
[07:06.340 --> 07:08.420]  A couple of copies of Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and 2.
[07:08.660 --> 07:09.840]  Crazy that those are there.
[07:10.800 --> 07:11.520]  Prominently displayed.
[07:11.660 --> 07:11.940]  Interesting.
[07:12.100 --> 07:12.560]  Wonder why.
[07:13.600 --> 07:14.420]  You know, a bunch of others.
[07:14.480 --> 07:14.980]  Our cookbook.
[07:15.080 --> 07:15.820]  There's some other stuff.
[07:16.180 --> 07:17.220]  Gavin's fuck-off socks.
[07:17.420 --> 07:17.780]  Who's Gavin?
[07:18.020 --> 07:18.960]  There's Gavin right there.
[07:19.240 --> 07:20.180]  Got a bad monitor.
[07:20.420 --> 07:21.980]  Hey, you guys remember the clog tube?
[07:22.120 --> 07:22.320]  Yep.
[07:22.540 --> 07:25.080]  I'm going to show you something else interesting that we've got going on today.
[07:25.080 --> 07:26.640]  As you know, it's our anniversary.
[07:26.840 --> 07:28.560]  Yesterday was Eric's birthday.
[07:28.740 --> 07:29.040]  It was.
[07:29.160 --> 07:30.000]  39 years young.
[07:30.600 --> 07:33.340]  And his favorite thing on earth is peanut M&M's.
[07:33.420 --> 07:35.460]  And so I did a thing for him to celebrate him.
[07:35.660 --> 07:37.040]  We got him some peanut M&M's over there.
[07:37.400 --> 07:38.180]  But that's not all.
[07:39.040 --> 07:42.440]  I want Eric to feel surprise and delight for one full year.
[07:42.620 --> 07:48.980]  So around the house, I have strategically hidden peanut butter M&M's.
[07:49.120 --> 07:51.280]  And every time he sees them, he's required to eat them.
[07:51.480 --> 07:53.980]  I have found so many already.
[07:54.340 --> 07:57.160]  I was looking for a pen, and I opened a drawer, and I went,
[07:57.480 --> 07:57.940]  Oh, that's weird.
[07:58.060 --> 07:59.500]  And then I closed it, opened the next drawer, and I went,
[07:59.760 --> 08:00.300]  What the fuck?
[08:00.680 --> 08:00.900]  What?
[08:01.280 --> 08:02.180]  Andrew, what are you doing?
[08:02.280 --> 08:04.100]  I'm looking for the peanut M&M's.
[08:04.340 --> 08:05.000]  I'm on your back.
[08:05.100 --> 08:05.760]  I got you, man.
[08:05.940 --> 08:06.400]  Wait, wait.
[08:06.800 --> 08:07.440]  Turn around.
[08:07.900 --> 08:08.460]  Okay, one sec.
[08:08.500 --> 08:09.620]  It's got a tricky turn.
[08:10.940 --> 08:11.260]  Turn.
[08:11.840 --> 08:12.220]  Turn it.
[08:12.380 --> 08:12.640]  Turn it.
[08:12.900 --> 08:13.220]  Almost.
[08:14.640 --> 08:15.100]  Turn it.
[08:15.480 --> 08:15.920]  It's tough.
[08:16.040 --> 08:16.680]  Okay, you're almost there.
[08:16.880 --> 08:17.080]  Okay.
[08:17.220 --> 08:17.720]  There we go.
[08:18.520 --> 08:18.740]  Okay.
[08:19.120 --> 08:19.380]  Ready?
[08:19.660 --> 08:19.920]  Yeah.
[08:19.960 --> 08:20.580]  Okay, eyes peeled.
[08:21.680 --> 08:22.080]  Ah!
[08:22.640 --> 08:23.040]  Ah!
[08:23.440 --> 08:23.840]  Ah!
[08:24.780 --> 08:25.180]  No!
[08:25.180 --> 08:25.980]  I'm behind you, son.
[08:26.820 --> 08:27.980]  No, you bumped into him.
[08:28.920 --> 08:29.880]  Oh, you run out of room.
[08:30.940 --> 08:31.620]  He's attacking me.
[08:31.660 --> 08:32.600]  He's doing peanut M&M jumps.
[08:32.620 --> 08:33.380]  I'm going back home.
[08:34.520 --> 08:42.200]  Here, we have robot Andrew to keep us in line, but also dutifully watching over us.
[08:42.280 --> 08:43.200]  Yeah, we've got him right here as well.
[08:43.340 --> 08:45.720]  Also, look at this fucking label maker, Gavin Potter.
[08:45.720 --> 08:46.000]  It's crazy.
[08:46.000 --> 08:47.780]  If anybody breaks in, we can kill them with this.
[08:47.800 --> 08:48.820]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[08:48.820 --> 08:50.100]  This is where our desks will be.
[08:50.360 --> 08:51.540]  We've got Nick in the corner.
[08:52.840 --> 08:53.540]  This is Eric.
[08:53.660 --> 08:54.720]  This is me and Gavin.
[08:54.820 --> 08:56.360]  You can tell that we have the good monitors.
[08:56.380 --> 08:59.020]  It's very weird how the monitor situation worked out.
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.000]  That's my personal monitor from home.
[09:01.180 --> 09:03.320]  And is this Geoff's personal monitor from home?
[09:03.440 --> 09:04.500]  Geoff may have looked at mine.
[09:04.580 --> 09:05.680]  My monitor broke.
[09:05.760 --> 09:06.240]  It's over there.
[09:06.300 --> 09:07.040]  The one that Gavin gave me.
[09:07.100 --> 09:07.820]  It's bad, see?
[09:07.940 --> 09:09.060]  I wrote bad on it.
[09:09.420 --> 09:10.740]  And so I needed another monitor.
[09:11.040 --> 09:12.340]  And this one was on Salish.
[09:14.880 --> 09:16.340]  And so this is where...
[09:16.340 --> 09:16.940]  Jesus, this gimbal.
[09:17.080 --> 09:17.740]  We have monitors.
[09:17.740 --> 09:18.440]  We have Xboxes.
[09:18.480 --> 09:19.760]  We do not have computers yet.
[09:19.920 --> 09:20.780]  Those are on order.
[09:21.100 --> 09:24.820]  If you come over here, this is the kitchen where all the culinary magic happens.
[09:24.880 --> 09:27.740]  There's going to be a lot of stuff filmed on this little island right here.
[09:27.760 --> 09:28.020]  We have a kitchen island here.
[09:28.300 --> 09:29.200]  It's very exciting.
[09:29.440 --> 09:30.300]  A lot of stuff.
[09:30.460 --> 09:30.840]  We're going to...
[09:30.840 --> 09:33.220]  I can't even talk about some of this stuff because that episode hasn't come out yet.
[09:33.540 --> 09:34.440]  But we've got supplies.
[09:35.440 --> 09:37.520]  We'll have hot dogs at some point today.
[09:40.120 --> 09:42.420]  And this is, by the way, from Burn Dog and Vanessa.
[09:42.580 --> 09:42.900]  Yeah.
[09:43.160 --> 09:45.800]  And then I made a happy birthday cake.
[09:45.860 --> 09:47.200]  You made a happy birthday cake?
[09:47.200 --> 09:48.080]  Well, I decorated it.
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.620]  See, it says, happy birthday, Eric and us.
[09:50.820 --> 09:52.040]  That's not what it...
[09:52.040 --> 09:52.350]  Or erectus.
[09:52.960 --> 09:53.860]  It says erectus.
[09:54.180 --> 09:56.200]  But it's like Eric and us.
[09:57.340 --> 09:58.180]  Because it's for both of us.
[09:58.420 --> 09:58.800]  Erectus?
[09:58.940 --> 09:59.520]  Erectus, yeah.
[09:59.720 --> 10:00.700]  And us could be...
[10:00.700 --> 10:02.420]  You could almost get anus out of that as well.
[10:02.580 --> 10:03.920]  You could almost get anus out of that.
[10:04.500 --> 10:09.620]  Did not steal this HEB basket, but it was in all the stuff that we got from the other place.
[10:09.800 --> 10:10.060]  Oh.
[10:10.240 --> 10:11.240]  I stole it by accident.
[10:11.260 --> 10:11.820]  Our mail was...
[10:11.820 --> 10:12.900]  Probably two years ago.
[10:13.080 --> 10:13.960]  You've got to give it back.
[10:13.980 --> 10:15.180]  We should film you returning it.
[10:16.900 --> 10:19.360]  Our fridge actually holds magnets.
[10:19.480 --> 10:19.680]  It does.
[10:19.920 --> 10:20.880]  So we can have our fridge magnet on it.
[10:20.900 --> 10:21.640]  And our little apple.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.380]  Remember that thing?
[10:22.640 --> 10:23.600]  Oh, it's so cool.
[10:23.600 --> 10:23.900]  Smashing success.
[10:24.500 --> 10:26.720]  And don't you worry.
[10:27.120 --> 10:27.380]  Dude.
[10:27.400 --> 10:28.840]  There's M&M's everywhere.
[10:28.900 --> 10:30.300]  Dude, what the...
[10:30.300 --> 10:31.600]  We've got sodas.
[10:31.660 --> 10:32.340]  Wow, Fiji water.
[10:32.720 --> 10:33.520]  You guys...
[10:34.640 --> 10:35.080]  Neapolitan?
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.180]  We've got M&M's in the fridge.
[10:36.180 --> 10:36.720]  Come on.
[10:36.980 --> 10:37.480]  We've got it everywhere.
[10:38.700 --> 10:40.520]  Nick's going crazy in there.
[10:41.040 --> 10:42.660]  Can't go into this room yet.
[10:42.760 --> 10:44.140]  This is for Gavin and Nick's show.
[10:44.140 --> 10:44.980]  There's a whole other...
[10:44.980 --> 10:46.260]  I would love to show you.
[10:46.360 --> 10:48.060]  It's a multi-room wing of the house.
[10:48.200 --> 10:48.480]  It is.
[10:48.600 --> 10:49.400]  But it is...
[10:49.400 --> 10:50.760]  Nick and I have kept everyone out of here.
[10:50.800 --> 10:51.720]  Yeah, we're not allowed in.
[10:52.120 --> 10:54.760]  And then, of course, it wouldn't be an office.
[10:54.860 --> 10:56.600]  By the way, the port-a-potty is back there.
[10:56.740 --> 10:57.060]  It is.
[10:57.120 --> 11:00.220]  We can't get to it, obviously, because Nick and Gavin won't let us.
[11:00.300 --> 11:01.780]  But the port-a-potty is on site.
[11:02.080 --> 11:04.220]  Also, way too big to fit in the house.
[11:05.040 --> 11:07.240]  It's like 12 inches wider than the door behind you.
[11:07.500 --> 11:09.040]  Can't take a port-a-potty apart.
[11:09.160 --> 11:09.780]  We thought we could.
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.660]  Got to de-rivet it to do it.
[11:11.660 --> 11:14.020]  Then you got to re-rivet it, so I don't think it's going to happen.
[11:14.360 --> 11:18.620]  But it wouldn't be an office without our old pal Nicholas Cage here.
[11:18.620 --> 11:18.920]  That's right.
[11:21.880 --> 11:24.540]  Dressing fresh, straight from...
[11:24.540 --> 11:25.200]  Oh, there's the ring.
[11:25.740 --> 11:26.260]  The one ring.
[11:26.620 --> 11:26.920]  Whoa!
[11:28.320 --> 11:29.080]  That's right.
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.800]  And then, of course, we wouldn't even have Nicholas Cage if it wasn't for Jackie Chan.
[11:33.840 --> 11:34.200]  Wow!
[11:34.480 --> 11:35.780]  This is the tuxedo.
[11:35.780 --> 11:35.880]  Wait a second.
[11:36.760 --> 11:37.060]  Oh no!
[11:37.500 --> 11:39.600]  Jackie Chan's a little petite.
[11:39.760 --> 11:41.000]  He's a little too petite for the model.
[11:41.940 --> 11:44.160]  Model's got a pretty juicy booty.
[11:47.760 --> 11:50.280]  Model's going to have to go on...
[11:50.280 --> 11:53.460]  Model's not going to be eating any of Eric's...
[11:53.460 --> 11:57.400]  No, but we're talking about all the stuff that we have here.
[11:57.700 --> 11:59.880]  But let's talk about some stuff that you can get at home today.
[12:00.020 --> 12:03.820]  In about 45 minutes, the patch shirt.
[12:06.640 --> 12:08.500]  The patch shirt goes on sale.
[12:08.620 --> 12:08.820]  Ready?
[12:08.980 --> 12:09.180]  Go.
[12:10.340 --> 12:10.700]  Whoa!
[12:11.380 --> 12:12.740]  That's what we're talking about.
[12:12.900 --> 12:15.880]  This patch shirt goes on sale in about 45 minutes.
[12:16.840 --> 12:19.360]  Regulationstore.com or regulationstore.store, I guess.
[12:19.460 --> 12:21.540]  If you don't want the shirt, but you want the patch, you can do that too.
[12:21.700 --> 12:23.320]  We will have extra patches.
[12:23.620 --> 12:26.880]  So if you have like, you know, you're like a denim vest guy or whatever.
[12:27.120 --> 12:27.200]  Yeah.
[12:27.300 --> 12:28.380]  I'm sure there are people like that.
[12:28.460 --> 12:28.800]  Probably a few.
[12:28.840 --> 12:31.340]  And you can get just the patch if you want just the patch.
[12:31.460 --> 12:32.400]  So we'll have that.
[12:32.660 --> 12:34.020]  We'll also have...
[12:34.840 --> 12:35.560]  some Kuzlers!
[12:36.740 --> 12:38.640]  Don't forget that Eric also likes Twix.
[12:38.640 --> 12:40.440]  So there's plenty of those hanging around.
[12:40.820 --> 12:41.920]  He also likes Milky Ways.
[12:42.000 --> 12:42.820]  I do like Milky Ways.
[12:43.360 --> 12:44.360]  I do. I like all those.
[12:44.460 --> 12:48.700]  So we have all of that, but we also have the Idiot Pennant.
[12:49.580 --> 12:49.860]  Today.
[12:50.320 --> 12:51.700]  Noon Central Time.
[12:51.820 --> 12:54.260]  Very shortly, it'll be going on sale.
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.200]  This is our office.
[12:56.960 --> 12:58.480]  This is what we work out of.
[12:58.580 --> 13:00.960]  It's been crazy setting this up.
[13:01.140 --> 13:01.860]  When did we move?
[13:01.960 --> 13:02.800]  When did we rent this?
[13:02.860 --> 13:03.480]  April 1st?
[13:03.600 --> 13:04.020]  Yes.
[13:04.020 --> 13:09.160]  So we have been here every day in some fashion since April 1st.
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.020]  It has been a slow process that has turned into...
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.380]  sometimes getting things that we don't need.
[13:19.500 --> 13:21.780]  I feel like you're going to talk shit about my cooling lamp.
[13:21.900 --> 13:23.620]  I think it's a really great invention.
[13:23.740 --> 13:24.680]  Where can we plug it in?
[13:25.620 --> 13:27.080]  Who unplugged my cooling lamp?
[13:27.160 --> 13:28.040]  Where does it plug into?
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.720]  It plugs in over here behind Nick Cage.
[13:31.140 --> 13:32.020]  What a sentence.
[13:35.620 --> 13:37.440]  There's going to be five computers in here.
[13:37.580 --> 13:38.560]  Yeah, it's going to be warm.
[13:38.700 --> 13:39.380]  It's going to be warm.
[13:39.480 --> 13:41.120]  So, Gavin, I'm steaming.
[13:41.260 --> 13:42.040]  You got to cool me off.
[13:42.040 --> 13:42.740]  Don't worry about it.
[13:42.780 --> 13:43.820]  Oh, is it dark as well?
[13:44.020 --> 13:44.420]  Hell yeah.
[13:45.940 --> 13:46.540]  Cooling lamp!
[13:49.700 --> 13:50.760]  Oh yeah, where's the remote?
[13:50.800 --> 13:51.680]  It's in there, I think.
[13:52.940 --> 13:53.720]  I'll tell you what is in there.
[13:53.880 --> 13:54.120]  Candy.
[13:54.860 --> 13:55.500]  Come on!
[13:56.280 --> 13:56.600]  Yeah!
[13:57.800 --> 13:59.160]  Does that know where the remote is?
[13:59.280 --> 13:59.900]  There it is.
[14:01.340 --> 14:01.920]  Oh shit!
[14:01.920 --> 14:02.840]  Oh, you can change the colors!
[14:04.900 --> 14:06.180]  Okay, Andrew's stoked.
[14:06.300 --> 14:06.560]  I'm all boring!
[14:06.560 --> 14:08.840]  You can call Eric old Red Fancock.
[14:10.220 --> 14:10.700]  Ah!
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.260]  Oh shit!
[14:14.880 --> 14:15.340]  That was cool.
[14:15.700 --> 14:18.220]  So, this is one of the many things...
[14:18.220 --> 14:22.980]  And this is what we can pass around as we get too hot.
[14:23.800 --> 14:28.280]  Oh, I'm being cooled by the breeze of the cooling fan.
[14:28.640 --> 14:31.700]  There's just so much good stuff in this frame all at the same time.
[14:32.260 --> 14:34.880]  Hey guys, we couldn't do this without you.
[14:35.300 --> 14:37.380]  Patreon.com slash TheRegulationPod.
[14:37.720 --> 14:40.300]  Oh yeah, definitely sign up for the Patreon.
[14:40.680 --> 14:42.940]  Get all the extra videos we've made over the last year.
[14:43.020 --> 14:46.060]  You have access to the last year of nonsense, plus the year going forward.
[14:46.060 --> 14:46.620]  Everything going forward.
[14:47.160 --> 14:48.960]  Kalonji powered, so you know it's going to be good.
[14:49.260 --> 14:52.200]  Andrew did a calculation of how many pieces of content we put out.
[14:52.380 --> 14:53.280]  Do you remember the numbers?
[14:53.520 --> 14:54.020]  It was so much.
[14:54.140 --> 14:56.920]  We promised 200 something, we gave over 300.
[14:56.920 --> 15:02.940]  I think we promised 260-ish, and we released 315 or something.
[15:03.380 --> 15:04.000]  Is that right, Andrew?
[15:04.480 --> 15:10.040]  Yeah, it's like low 200s is what we promised, and like 313 or so, I believe.
[15:10.160 --> 15:10.500]  Wow.
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.440]  We ended up delivering like 60 or 70.
[15:12.440 --> 15:15.960]  That's almost something every day, and we have a bunch of new stuff coming out soon.
[15:16.040 --> 15:17.640]  Like maybe a new season of Fuck Face Off.
[15:17.760 --> 15:18.840]  So, check it out.
[15:19.040 --> 15:21.540]  Patreon, if you're wondering, hey, what's the best way we can support these guys?
[15:21.860 --> 15:26.360]  We love watching, you can watch us wherever you watch stuff, but...
[15:26.360 --> 15:27.300]  Put this right in between.
[15:28.240 --> 15:28.820]  There you go.
[15:29.560 --> 15:32.020]  But, the best way to support us is patreon.com.
[15:32.800 --> 15:35.740]  That is number 1, the best way to support us.
[15:35.900 --> 15:40.220]  And a huge thanks to anyone who's going to sign up for another year of the Patreon.
[15:40.240 --> 15:41.040]  And who already did.
[15:42.020 --> 15:46.860]  And thank you to everyone who's been stopping by and watching this live stream, because we got an actual office.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.040]  This is crazy.
[15:48.400 --> 15:51.020]  Yeah, we have to return it after this, we got the tab for it.
[15:51.300 --> 15:53.160]  As soon as this stream's over, we're going to take it back to the store.
[15:53.240 --> 15:55.280]  Yeah, so, that's exciting.
[15:55.280 --> 15:56.620]  Well, you guys want to play some Mario Party?
[15:56.800 --> 15:57.540]  Let's play!
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.800]  Can you believe we did that whole walkthrough without getting tripped by Andrew?
[16:00.920 --> 16:01.880]  That was, I think, pretty impressive.
[16:02.160 --> 16:04.120]  He's like, trying to avoid you guys.
[16:04.360 --> 16:05.540]  I think he's gone back under the...
[16:06.180 --> 16:08.060]  Oh, he's hanging out with Nick. That's nice.
[16:11.700 --> 16:12.500]  Oh, there he is!
[16:12.600 --> 16:13.600]  Welcome back!
[16:14.340 --> 16:17.560]  I'm here to stare you fuckers down while we play.
[16:17.780 --> 16:18.560]  This is, uh...
[16:19.320 --> 16:21.020]  My favorite thing about this...
[16:21.020 --> 16:22.200]  Look at this little fucking guy!
[16:22.660 --> 16:23.100]  Look at him!
[16:24.540 --> 16:25.320]  He's staring.
[16:26.540 --> 16:27.500]  Andrew, look!
[16:28.340 --> 16:29.320]  Look at my shoes!
[16:29.720 --> 16:31.320]  My favorite thing about this gimbal
[16:31.320 --> 16:32.940]  is that it self-levels
[16:32.940 --> 16:34.160]  slightly on the piss.
[16:35.120 --> 16:37.260]  It's like six degrees off, and I love it.
[16:38.020 --> 16:42.360]  Speaking of the piss,
[16:42.560 --> 16:44.620]  I'm going to turn the air purifier up just a little bit.
[16:44.700 --> 16:44.820]  Speaking of the piss,
[16:44.820 --> 16:46.020]  Oh yeah, that's one of the things.
[16:46.500 --> 16:48.700]  So our couch co-op room, which is probably the room
[16:48.700 --> 16:50.240]  we'll spend most of our recording time in,
[16:51.040 --> 16:51.880]  not in the kitchen,
[16:52.560 --> 16:54.600]  we've determined, after about two weeks
[16:54.600 --> 16:56.700]  of being in here, that there was a cat
[16:56.700 --> 16:58.800]  in this room, and that cat pissed a lot.
[16:58.820 --> 16:59.220]  A lot.
[16:59.300 --> 17:00.780]  And it really makes me feel like I'm at home.
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.620]  I get why it fucks with Gavin's brain.
[17:04.800 --> 17:06.180]  It really cuts through you.
[17:06.200 --> 17:06.800]  It checks out.
[17:06.860 --> 17:10.100]  You get nose blindness, and every so often,
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.340]  your nose reawakens.
[17:11.460 --> 17:12.280]  It sneaks through.
[17:13.720 --> 17:14.380]  Sneaky nose.
[17:14.380 --> 17:15.200]  Sneaky nose.
[17:18.980 --> 17:20.220]  Bring it back, Eric.
[17:20.620 --> 17:22.580]  One sec, one sec, let me get over here.
[17:24.500 --> 17:25.180]  Hey, Nick.
[17:26.260 --> 17:26.940]  Hey, Nick.
[17:27.040 --> 17:28.500]  What's up, buddy?
[17:28.820 --> 17:29.700]  Secret Alliance.
[17:31.580 --> 17:32.100]  Shadow Alliance.
[17:34.260 --> 17:36.400]  I think only Geoff can hear you, and he didn't listen.
[17:37.180 --> 17:38.080]  I didn't hear what he said.
[17:38.240 --> 17:39.540]  Don't worry, you got it.
[17:40.160 --> 17:41.300]  Alright, I'm going to put this down.
[17:42.740 --> 17:43.200]  Alright.
[17:43.820 --> 17:44.960]  Thanks for that.
[17:46.300 --> 17:47.580]  You get the Nick's ass shot?
[17:47.720 --> 17:47.920]  Yep.
[17:49.520 --> 17:50.700]  That's for our only fans.
[17:51.900 --> 17:52.640]  Andrew, you look cool.
[17:52.940 --> 17:54.060]  No, Andrew, what are you doing?
[17:54.100 --> 17:54.520]  Fuck that thing.
[17:54.980 --> 17:56.000]  I'm the only tech.
