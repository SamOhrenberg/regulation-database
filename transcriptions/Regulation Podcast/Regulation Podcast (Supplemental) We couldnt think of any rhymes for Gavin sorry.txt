[00:00.000 --> 00:03.380]  If you're a referee, do you ever think that your name would be Referee Geoffrey?
[00:04.000 --> 00:07.280]  That's never crossed my mind in my entire life until now, but
[00:07.280 --> 00:10.140]  Ref Geoff is way better than Chef Geoff.
[00:11.120 --> 00:13.300]  What other jobs did you have that weren't Geoff?
[00:15.820 --> 00:16.500]  That's it.
[00:18.080 --> 00:20.960]  If you know some more names, leave them in the comments.
[00:21.100 --> 00:25.160]  You could be Oil Derrick Eric.
[00:26.540 --> 00:29.300]  But if my name was Derrick, then I could just be Oil Derrick.
[00:29.300 --> 00:30.520]  That should have been better.
