[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  If you took one of my balls, whose kids would you be having?
[00:05.240 --> 00:06.460]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:06.900 --> 00:08.840]  Yeah. Like if you just had someone else's ball put on,
[00:08.940 --> 00:11.060]  does it start making their kids or the ball's kids?
[00:12.140 --> 00:13.400]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:13.620 --> 00:15.520]  That's yeah, I'm too dumb for this.
[00:16.040 --> 00:18.600]  Oh, because it'd be pretty cool to have one of your own
[00:18.600 --> 00:19.500]  and one of someone else's.
[00:19.560 --> 00:20.820]  And then it's just kind of a potluck.
[00:21.420 --> 00:22.680]  Like a split. You know what?
[00:22.980 --> 00:25.320]  Where do babies come from? Is that the title of this episode?
