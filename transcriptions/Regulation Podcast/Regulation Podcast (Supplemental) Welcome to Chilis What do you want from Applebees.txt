[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  I think it'd be fun to go into a restaurant and copy all the QR codes on the tables and
[00:04.080 --> 00:06.100]  then print them and put them in a different restaurant.
[00:14.820 --> 00:19.340]  In Austin, I'd say there's probably a 50-50 shot your menu's gonna be a QR code. Or they'll
[00:19.340 --> 00:21.040]  have a QR option as a menu.
[00:21.960 --> 00:22.320]  Interesting.
[00:23.480 --> 00:25.720]  It's just like pull up the menu for Chili's, like what?
[00:27.280 --> 00:32.980]  Dude, if I went to a menu and someone did a QR code mix-em-up on me, I would be furious.
[00:33.680 --> 00:38.840]  I already hate the QR code menu thing, like that is, that's probably like my most like
[00:38.840 --> 00:41.580]  boomer opinion is that I'm just over the QR code thing.
[00:41.980 --> 00:47.420]  Dude, if I went to Daynana, I scanned the fucking QR code, it's like yo check it out
[00:47.420 --> 00:48.020]  Applebee's.
[00:48.140 --> 00:49.580]  I would be so mad.
