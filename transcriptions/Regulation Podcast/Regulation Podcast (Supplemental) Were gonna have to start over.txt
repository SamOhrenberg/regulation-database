[00:00.000 --> 00:04.720]  What if we recorded an episode one day where we all had like a slider from 1 to 10 open
[00:04.720 --> 00:09.740]  and we all streamed our view and we would keep it updated with how the episode's going
[00:09.740 --> 00:14.720]  on where it lies out of 10. I hate that. I think it's a terrible idea. It's pretty good.
[00:15.160 --> 00:18.420]  You guys should... It's insane. I would, yeah, that would be a terrible idea. I'm gonna
[00:18.420 --> 00:25.660]  be on 3 all the time. You would never like... I never feel good about our content. It would
[00:27.940 --> 00:33.280]  probably bump up to 4 or 5 every once in a while. See, I imagine we'd all start at 5
[00:33.280 --> 00:37.260]  and then Andrew would come in saying, you know, what's a corn seed? And I would immediately
[00:37.260 --> 00:41.300]  slide it up to an 8. Oh, I'd go down to a 3.
