[00:00.000 --> 00:01.480]  If I had to lose a bone?
[00:02.120 --> 00:04.760]  Oh, immediately the pinkies come to mind.
[00:05.040 --> 00:05.300]  What?
[00:05.660 --> 00:07.340]  Baby toe. Maybe the baby toe?
[00:07.740 --> 00:08.060]  I don't know.
[00:08.120 --> 00:10.120]  I think you need all the balance you can get with your ankles.
[00:10.460 --> 00:11.260]  That's true.
[00:12.680 --> 00:14.120]  But maybe that's the way to go.
[00:14.160 --> 00:17.320]  Maybe just make it worse because it's already not good.
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.340]  Maybe just like embrace the bad.
[00:19.840 --> 00:23.300]  What if you just like went with at least just had one less rib?
[00:23.680 --> 00:25.520]  Oh, yeah. You can suck yourself up and all that.
[00:25.680 --> 00:28.700]  Yeah, yeah. And that's and that's the way God created woman.
[00:28.700 --> 00:29.860]  So that's true.
[00:30.040 --> 00:33.120]  Oh, do a woman really have one less rib?
[00:37.020 --> 00:39.980]  Do women really have one less rib?
[00:40.260 --> 00:42.260]  And that's the title of this episode.
[00:44.020 --> 00:44.880]  Is that bollocks?
[00:45.060 --> 00:48.940]  You have an ability as and I've known you for most of your life now.
[00:49.040 --> 00:50.640]  One of the smartest people I've ever met.
[00:50.740 --> 00:54.280]  But you have an ability to sound so unbelievably stupid when you speak.
