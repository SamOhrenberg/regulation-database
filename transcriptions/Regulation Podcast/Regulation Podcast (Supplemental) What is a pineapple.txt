[00:00.000 --> 00:03.900]  What if, using sliced pineapple, I made a fruit bagel?
[00:06.020 --> 00:07.960]  It'd be goopy and wet.
[00:08.280 --> 00:08.540]  Yeah.
[00:09.160 --> 00:13.000]  I'm not sure what...
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.220]  Why is it a bagel?
[00:14.920 --> 00:17.000]  Because there's a hole in the middle, I think it's...
[00:22.000 --> 00:23.020]  It's just like...
[00:23.020 --> 00:23.700]  Is it more of a donut?
[00:24.140 --> 00:26.060]  Would you call it a pine-agle or a...
[00:27.680 --> 00:28.560]  An apple?
[00:28.560 --> 00:30.040]  Why don't we put it to the internet?
[00:30.340 --> 00:30.980]  We'll put a poll.
[00:31.300 --> 00:35.240]  Is a pineapple ring a fruit bagel or a fruit donut?
[00:35.660 --> 00:37.760]  I think it should just say, what is a pineapple?
[00:38.420 --> 00:41.000]  And then you could just put a bagel or a donut.
[00:41.260 --> 00:45.900]  I don't think you need to explain anything about what you're trying to get specific about.
[00:46.120 --> 00:48.200]  You just ask people if it's a bagel or a donut.
