[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  I still remember the first thing I was impressed by.
[00:02.120 --> 00:02.500]  What?
[00:04.280 --> 00:08.580]  I think as a kid, you're often impressed by stuff that's shit.
[00:08.860 --> 00:09.160]  Yeah, of course.
[00:09.160 --> 00:11.260]  But it's just the first time you've seen it, so it's like, whoa.
[00:11.780 --> 00:13.540]  I was impressed by a wet book.
[00:13.780 --> 00:14.240]  What do you mean?
[00:14.300 --> 00:18.600]  It was a book that had been rained on, and it dried all like wavy,
[00:18.860 --> 00:20.240]  and I remember being blown away by that.
[00:20.540 --> 00:21.560]  I was like, that is brilliant.
[00:21.880 --> 00:23.200]  It's like a book, but it's wavy.
[00:23.940 --> 00:29.180]  I think you almost don't know what impressed means.
[00:30.100 --> 00:30.980]  What do you mean?
[00:31.140 --> 00:32.400]  I thought it was great.
[00:33.520 --> 00:33.880]  Crazy.
[00:34.400 --> 00:37.600]  I used to take it out of the bookcase and show it to people when they came over.
[00:37.700 --> 00:38.260]  I was like, look at this.
[00:41.300 --> 00:44.500]  It was one of the first weird things I saw.
[00:44.900 --> 00:48.820]  Oh, I was also impressed by, um, like pool cues.
[00:49.200 --> 00:51.380]  I used to love watching people play pool.
[00:51.760 --> 00:53.460]  I used to love watching wheels go around.
[00:53.560 --> 00:54.220]  I love the wet book.
