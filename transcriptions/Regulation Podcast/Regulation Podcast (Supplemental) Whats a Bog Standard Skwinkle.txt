[00:00.000 --> 00:05.160]  I was at the airport and I discovered a candy that is the funniest candy name I've ever
[00:05.160 --> 00:08.920]  heard in my entire life. I noticed Squinkles Chunks.
[00:09.180 --> 00:13.280]  Hell yeah, Squinkles Chunks! Squinkles Chunks.
[00:13.420 --> 00:16.620]  What are Squinkles Chunks? We couldn't stop saying it.
[00:16.780 --> 00:21.800]  I am alarmed by the grape colors. Are those grapes? What are those? Like the coloring
[00:21.800 --> 00:26.040]  of the fruit is alarming on the package. You got grapes for that? Is that grape?
[00:27.100 --> 00:31.660]  Are those cherries? What are they? And what is that little diagram? Like a bean?
[00:31.860 --> 00:35.360]  There's like three beans in a pod of some sort. That's what I was saying was the cherry
[00:35.360 --> 00:37.940]  or grapes. HEB sells Squinkles Chunks.
[00:38.360 --> 00:42.560]  Hell yeah! Oh my god, can we like Instacart some?
[00:42.780 --> 00:50.860]  I'm looking up what original squinkles are. I can't... what is happening? Gavin, what
[00:50.860 --> 00:56.400]  does that say? Squinkles... Sal... Sal... Squinklesasparilla?
[00:57.300 --> 00:58.640]  SALSAGETTI YOU IDIOT!
