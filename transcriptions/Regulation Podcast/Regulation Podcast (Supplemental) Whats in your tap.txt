[00:00.000 --> 00:03.760]  If you could install a tap in your house that could dispense any drink, what would it be
[00:03.760 --> 00:04.280]  in your house?
[00:04.580 --> 00:05.600]  Well, today it'd be sarsaparilla.
[00:06.940 --> 00:08.300]  Probably cold brew coffee.
[00:10.520 --> 00:13.140]  You would drink way too much of that if it came out of a tap.
[00:13.700 --> 00:19.080]  It would be, it would be such an issue for my day to day life, but boy, what a ride those
[00:19.080 --> 00:19.980]  two weeks would be.
[00:22.540 --> 00:24.900]  What about Nick and Andrew, what would be in your taps?
[00:25.080 --> 00:26.680]  I think I know myself too well.
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.120]  It would be, as Eric said, a problem to have like a soda or something.
[00:31.200 --> 00:33.060]  I think I'd just go with like a sparkling water.
[00:33.340 --> 00:35.620]  Maybe like an orange bubble.
[00:36.920 --> 00:37.620]  I'd have Pepsi.
[00:38.560 --> 00:42.960]  Oh man, I almost, like similar to Eric's, the cold brew coffee, but I think I would
[00:42.960 --> 00:46.900]  go with something that's more of like, would I go with a dark beer?
[00:47.180 --> 00:48.040]  This is great.
[00:48.200 --> 00:52.480]  We're all playing pretend and Nick is treating it like he has to make a decision for what's
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.240]  about to go in his house.
[00:53.360 --> 00:54.280]  I appreciate that though.
[00:54.300 --> 00:56.560]  I'm glad he's not just shitting out a meaningless answer.
