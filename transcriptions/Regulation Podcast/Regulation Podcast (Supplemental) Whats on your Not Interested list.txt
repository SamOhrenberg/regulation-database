[00:00.000 --> 00:09.080]  My next one actually has to do with TikTok. TikTok continuing to show me videos that I say
[00:09.600 --> 00:21.820]  not interested to. There is an option to say I am not interested. I am telling the app
[00:21.820 --> 00:29.200]  I'm not interested. And the app is going, I think I can change your mind about this one.
[00:29.200 --> 00:41.220]  And it wants to continue to show me like war videos. Like the most insane shit. I'm trying
[00:41.220 --> 00:46.380]  to get on TikTok for very specific stuff. And the things it's trying to show me, I'm not interested
[00:46.380 --> 00:51.540]  in. And I try to tell it, hey, check out these people dancing. No, never in my life do I want
[00:51.540 --> 00:57.420]  to see these people dancing. That's not why I'm here. I'm here for the weird cartel videos shot
[00:57.420 --> 01:00.720]  on a Nokia phone. That's what I'm on TikTok for. Give me more of that.
