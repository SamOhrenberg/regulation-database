[00:00.000 --> 00:03.360]  What's the number one body function?
[00:07.220 --> 00:07.620]  What?
[00:08.220 --> 00:10.520]  I like a sneeze is up there as well.
[00:10.920 --> 00:14.720]  Yeah. Yeah. I didn't I didn't think my question was that confusing, but it's
[00:14.720 --> 00:16.400]  what I think other. Yeah. What do you think?
[00:16.460 --> 00:18.300]  It's like what's higher on the list than puking?
[00:18.380 --> 00:20.380]  Like what's better? I think feels better.
[00:20.500 --> 00:21.500]  I think a sneeze is better.
[00:21.840 --> 00:24.400]  It's probably everything. Everything feels better.
[00:24.720 --> 00:26.300]  It's the worst thing you can do.
[00:26.580 --> 00:29.980]  It's the you think it's the worst puking in the act of it?
[00:29.980 --> 00:34.020]  Yeah. Yeah. If you said, you know, would you rather sneeze or would you throw up
[00:34.020 --> 00:36.000]  and feel the satisfaction from not feeling bad anymore?
[00:36.140 --> 00:39.320]  I put a bunch of functions above vomit because you have to go through the vomit.
[00:39.580 --> 00:40.580]  Yeah. The vomit isn't fun.
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.980]  Oh, trigger warning for vomit talk today.
[00:43.200 --> 00:46.220]  Oh, cool. Good timing on that one, man. Thank you very much.
