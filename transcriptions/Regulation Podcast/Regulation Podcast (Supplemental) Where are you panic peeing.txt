[00:00.000 --> 00:05.240]  Let's go around and say where we would panic pee in, let's say, a Home Depot.
[00:05.440 --> 00:09.340]  That's fine. Let's start with Nick. Nick, where would you panic pee in the Home Depot?
[00:09.640 --> 00:11.900]  If the bathroom is no option. Yeah. I'm going outside.
[00:12.200 --> 00:15.260]  I'm going out to the garden section. Yeah. OK.
[00:15.400 --> 00:18.520]  I'm going behind the mulch. OK.
[00:18.880 --> 00:20.800]  Gavin, where would you pee?
[00:20.800 --> 00:24.660]  I'd probably just start like peeking around little staff only areas, little doors,
[00:24.720 --> 00:27.000]  and I just piss in the mop bucket or something.
[00:27.640 --> 00:30.640]  Oh, I take the mop out, have a piss in that,
[00:30.960 --> 00:34.500]  then I'd rinse it out, get it nice and clean and then put it back.
[00:34.780 --> 00:36.740]  Oh, I got a great one.
[00:37.100 --> 00:40.480]  I would I would piss in one of the orange five gallon buckets that you got.
[00:40.760 --> 00:44.880]  Yes. Yeah, that's exactly that's exactly what I was going to say.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  But I'll change my answer to the overhead,
[00:49.080 --> 00:51.780]  the ceiling fan and light section and just sort of.
[00:52.080 --> 00:53.400]  Yeah, there's never anybody in there.
[00:53.520 --> 00:54.820]  No, it's empty.
[00:54.820 --> 00:58.680]  There's no one looking at ceiling fans and overhead lights in the Home Depot.
