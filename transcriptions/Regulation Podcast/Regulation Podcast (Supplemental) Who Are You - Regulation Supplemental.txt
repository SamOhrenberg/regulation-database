[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  Hello and welcome to another piece of supplemental content.
[00:04.260 --> 00:07.700]  I got a new show, a new idea for you guys.
[00:07.840 --> 00:09.280]  We're going to play a new game.
[00:09.620 --> 00:11.540]  I'm excited to see how this goes.
[00:11.960 --> 00:13.100]  This could be a disaster.
[00:13.620 --> 00:15.680]  This could be great. We'll find out.
[00:15.740 --> 00:17.720]  There's probably going to be adjustments as we do these,
[00:17.780 --> 00:19.200]  if we even do more of them.
[00:19.460 --> 00:21.260]  But I think it has a chance to be a lot of fun.
[00:21.720 --> 00:24.360]  We are playing a thing I'm calling Who Are You?
[00:25.720 --> 00:27.380]  How are you guys feeling about this?
[00:28.080 --> 00:28.800]  You have no idea.
[00:28.800 --> 00:30.460]  I don't feel anything.
[00:30.860 --> 00:31.800]  Hi, it's me, Eric.
[00:31.940 --> 00:35.480]  I'm here with Geoff and Nick, and Andrew is hosting Who Are You?
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.280]  Who are you?
[00:37.500 --> 00:42.360]  So yesterday I sent out a series of questions to all of you guys
[00:42.950 --> 00:46.840]  that you would have opinions on, and you sent me answers and I compiled them.
[00:47.580 --> 00:50.080]  So how this game works is there are two players
[00:50.520 --> 00:53.220]  and the players in this episode are going to be Eric and Geoff.
[00:53.880 --> 00:54.620]  You are the players.
[00:54.880 --> 00:58.780]  OK, now there's going to be a third role that you're going to play, Nick.
[00:58.800 --> 01:00.360]  Called the interviewer.
[01:00.600 --> 01:03.740]  And this is something that the audience can kind of play along as they listen.
[01:04.500 --> 01:09.760]  So the goal of the game is, is I am going to read one of the things I ask.
[01:09.800 --> 01:12.220]  So one of the things was, what is a movie you love?
[01:12.600 --> 01:14.700]  I will read, what is a movie you love?
[01:15.020 --> 01:18.820]  And then I will give an answer that was submitted that somebody picked.
[01:19.380 --> 01:21.660]  And the idea was, these are things you don't necessarily associate
[01:21.660 --> 01:23.140]  or think the other guys know about you.
[01:23.520 --> 01:28.180]  I will say it and which once I finish, Eric and Geoff,
[01:28.180 --> 01:31.440]  you will immediately begin trying to convince Nick
[01:31.440 --> 01:33.340]  that this is an opinion you have.
[01:33.600 --> 01:36.340]  Now, maybe it is an opinion you have, but Nick, you need to determine
[01:36.340 --> 01:39.720]  if it is so much of an opinion they have that they would write it
[01:39.720 --> 01:41.580]  as their answer to this question.
[01:42.260 --> 01:44.480]  Now, you have the ability as the interviewer, Nick,
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.200]  to ask five questions throughout this process.
[01:48.160 --> 01:50.220]  Then you will have to make a decision.
[01:50.840 --> 01:52.560]  Is this Eric's answer?
[01:52.600 --> 01:53.420]  Is he being truthful?
[01:53.780 --> 01:57.960]  Is it Geoff's answer or is it Gavin or Ice?
[01:57.960 --> 01:59.000]  Is it neither of them?
[01:59.080 --> 02:00.000]  They're both pretending.
[02:01.100 --> 02:03.220]  It might not even be one of ours.
[02:03.540 --> 02:04.100]  This is great.
[02:04.580 --> 02:07.080]  Oh, we're going to keep track of all the points.
[02:07.820 --> 02:09.220]  Everyone's going to cycle through.
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.180]  And at the end of everyone getting a chance to be the interviewer
[02:12.180 --> 02:14.680]  with all the combinations, we will reveal the final score.
[02:14.780 --> 02:16.680]  We'll do episode by episode scoring as well.
[02:16.900 --> 02:21.180]  But this isn't over until everyone's gone through the maximum interview process.
[02:21.760 --> 02:22.400]  Keep track of that.
[02:22.420 --> 02:23.380]  Is there anything I'm missing?
[02:23.980 --> 02:25.100]  You ask questions.
[02:25.840 --> 02:26.700]  You guys have any questions?
[02:26.700 --> 02:29.960]  So Nick is the only person scoring today.
[02:30.380 --> 02:32.060]  You can get. OK, thank you.
[02:32.140 --> 02:32.960]  That is what I was going to explain.
[02:33.240 --> 02:38.780]  If Nick rules, if Nick, let's say, Geoff, it's not yours,
[02:38.800 --> 02:40.700]  but you convince Nick that it is.
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.120]  You get a point if he correctly picks you. OK.
[02:44.760 --> 02:49.040]  Oh, Nick, if you pick correctly, you get a point.
[02:49.620 --> 02:52.740]  And if you're both truthful, if you if you like,
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.280]  if you get truth on the person, you both get points. Got it.
[02:56.280 --> 02:59.780]  So if I say if I say my favorite food is
[03:00.800 --> 03:03.340]  pizza and then Nick picks me for pizza, we both get a point.
[03:03.560 --> 03:04.900]  You both get a point. Yeah. OK.
[03:05.100 --> 03:07.320]  And Nick, you can also there will be, as I said,
[03:07.900 --> 03:11.580]  responses that are not either Geoff or Eric or whoever the players are.
[03:11.680 --> 03:12.960]  And you would have to pick a third one.
[03:12.980 --> 03:15.720]  In that case, you would just get a point by yourself.
[03:16.280 --> 03:17.800]  So that would increase your own score.
[03:18.260 --> 03:21.180]  We'll see. I think it'll be fun by the end of this to see like
[03:21.180 --> 03:23.000]  who gets the most as the interviewer.
[03:23.100 --> 03:25.780]  We'll balance it out so the points make sense throughout these episodes.
[03:26.500 --> 03:28.280]  Any questions before we begin?
[03:28.840 --> 03:29.860]  You said five questions.
[03:29.980 --> 03:31.740]  Is that of each of them or all together?
[03:31.900 --> 03:33.880]  All together, you get five questions.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.780]  So you have to be and you have to pick who you're asking.
[03:36.320 --> 03:40.240]  So he could choose to not like if he thinks he knows right off the bat,
[03:40.280 --> 03:41.180]  he doesn't have to ask a question.
[03:41.260 --> 03:44.460]  He could bank and ask three questions on the same one. Exactly.
[03:44.840 --> 03:46.480]  OK, well, it's every round. Sorry.
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.460]  So I'll do one. He'll get five.
[03:48.560 --> 03:51.580]  OK, so remember when you asked that question and then he gave you an answer?
[03:51.760 --> 03:53.780]  The answer is actually the opposite of what he said.
[03:53.780 --> 03:58.200]  Sorry, I was compiling something and then I realized I misheard what you said.
[03:59.560 --> 04:01.520]  Welcome to Regulation Podcast.
[04:01.820 --> 04:05.120]  You almost got the answer you were looking for the first time. Nearly.
[04:05.500 --> 04:07.040]  Listen, but it was immediately correct.
[04:07.100 --> 04:08.460]  And it wasn't a fight that was on me.
[04:08.520 --> 04:10.480]  I acknowledge that I'm totally fine. Totally fine.
[04:11.260 --> 04:14.520]  We're ready to begin the game of who are you?
[04:14.960 --> 04:16.380]  Yeah, I'm nervous. Let's do it.
[04:16.440 --> 04:20.240]  OK, a movie I love is The Mummy.
[04:21.040 --> 04:24.240]  Eric and Geoff, again, immediately, that's me.
[04:25.380 --> 04:28.920]  Do I just let Eric talk and then you interject as much as you want?
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.380]  Hey, guys, listen to how Geoff didn't even chime in.
[04:33.960 --> 04:35.800]  Yeah, I just don't know when I'm right.
[04:36.020 --> 04:39.580]  No, right. It's because it's because if he tells you that the mummy is his,
[04:39.840 --> 04:42.320]  he's a liar because I wrote the mummy.
[04:43.320 --> 04:45.720]  Oh, I just know to call Geoff.
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.580]  You feel free to interject as much as you want.
[04:47.580 --> 04:50.700]  And again, see how he's not jumping in because the mummy's not his.
[04:51.120 --> 04:54.520]  I don't. I just I have trouble lying to Nick.
[04:54.800 --> 04:56.540]  I have so much respect for him.
[04:57.080 --> 05:00.220]  It feels weird. I gotta be honest.
[05:00.240 --> 05:00.780]  I'm not the mummy.
[05:01.700 --> 05:03.220]  Oh, OK. All right.
[05:03.300 --> 05:04.860]  Well, that that is helpful. Yeah.
[05:04.980 --> 05:06.180]  Unless I'm trying to trick him.
[05:06.920 --> 05:08.820]  But why would you? You would get a point if I guessed it.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.640]  So Nick, we could just save everyone a lot of time.
[05:14.640 --> 05:18.500]  What? Now, here's the thing you need to evaluate, Nick.
[05:18.780 --> 05:19.880]  Is Eric being truthful?
[05:20.740 --> 05:25.640]  Well, yeah, that's yeah, that's I think I think I know whose answer that is.
[05:25.660 --> 05:26.460]  And it's not Eric's.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.380]  I don't understand what I don't get what Geoff's plan is here.
[05:33.280 --> 05:36.460]  Other than he I have I have a great plan.
[05:36.540 --> 05:37.840]  Don't worry, I'm on it.
[05:38.340 --> 05:41.380]  Is Geoff now you have to consider, Nick, is Geoff being honest
[05:41.380 --> 05:43.640]  or is he trying to prevent Eric from getting a point
[05:43.640 --> 05:46.860]  if he thinks that that's it sounds like he's trying to prevent Eric
[05:46.860 --> 05:50.100]  from getting a point and saying, hey, it's the mummy.
[05:50.300 --> 05:52.100]  So that way we both get a point.
[05:52.300 --> 05:55.860]  Or is Geoff actually helping you, Nick, and trying to get you a point
[05:55.860 --> 05:57.340]  by not picking Eric?
[05:57.420 --> 05:59.140]  Yeah, it's not it's definitely not Eric.
[05:59.280 --> 06:00.380]  And it's not a movie he would have picked.
[06:00.480 --> 06:01.980]  It's not it's not an Eric style.
[06:02.100 --> 06:03.460]  The mummy in Indiana.
[06:03.680 --> 06:09.040]  Like it is an Indiana Jones adventure with Brendan Frazier that scares me.
[06:09.140 --> 06:11.480]  And I think about to this day with the scarabs.
[06:11.680 --> 06:13.420]  Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?
[06:13.420 --> 06:14.080]  Brendan Frazier.
[06:14.500 --> 06:15.880]  Eric, who else is in it?
[06:16.000 --> 06:17.640]  Eric watches Speed over and over again.
[06:17.680 --> 06:18.860]  He's not watching the mummy over and over again.
[06:18.860 --> 06:19.820]  I think I watch Speed.
[06:20.180 --> 06:21.160]  So what's going on?
[06:21.320 --> 06:24.940]  Are you Meg, where you think that like somebody saw Speed
[06:24.940 --> 06:27.520]  one time three months ago and you went you watch Speed every day?
[06:27.780 --> 06:28.520]  Are you insane?
[06:28.620 --> 06:31.480]  You said every time it's on TV, you stop and watch it.
[06:31.840 --> 06:33.520]  Eric, name some of the other cast.
[06:34.100 --> 06:36.220]  Oh, Rachel Weisz is in it.
[06:36.360 --> 06:42.800]  OK, you have a guy who looks like Billy Zane, but he's not.
[06:43.320 --> 06:45.060]  That's not Billy Zane.
[06:45.460 --> 06:46.660]  You think it is?
[06:46.820 --> 06:49.680]  And pretty much almost my whole life, I thought it was.
[06:50.140 --> 06:53.560]  And then when I was probably like 22, I was like people.
[06:53.720 --> 06:55.060]  I'm like, yeah, didn't Billy Zane in the mummy.
[06:55.180 --> 06:56.240]  And they're like, he's not in the mummy.
[06:56.580 --> 06:57.800]  I'm like, he's the mummy.
[06:57.840 --> 06:59.200]  And they went, no, he's not.
[07:00.540 --> 07:02.820]  And it's a guy that looks just like him.
[07:02.860 --> 07:03.520]  I don't know his name.
[07:04.720 --> 07:06.520]  OK, guy who looks like the mummy.
[07:06.960 --> 07:07.980]  I'm kidding. It's me.
[07:08.040 --> 07:08.700]  I like the mummy.
[07:08.980 --> 07:10.300]  This is ridiculous.
[07:10.740 --> 07:11.440]  That's just it.
[07:11.500 --> 07:13.860]  OK, well, Geoff, I'm going to direct my questions towards Eric.
[07:13.960 --> 07:14.300]  I'm sorry.
[07:17.540 --> 07:19.720]  Eric, do you remember the name of the little squirrely guy
[07:19.720 --> 07:20.940]  who gets stuck on the other side of the river?
[07:21.520 --> 07:23.760]  Is it was that John?
[07:25.260 --> 07:28.380]  See, you know, you don't know because you didn't put the mummy.
[07:28.660 --> 07:30.720]  John's a fucking fake ass name.
[07:31.880 --> 07:34.620]  I will say, Nick, you don't have to ask all five questions.
[07:34.640 --> 07:37.080]  If you make a decision beforehand, you can just lock it in.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.020]  But you have three more.
[07:38.420 --> 07:39.560]  I'm leaning a certain way.
[07:39.560 --> 07:43.580]  Eric, how many objects had to be obtained before he got his full power?
[07:43.780 --> 07:43.960]  Four.
[07:46.780 --> 07:47.260]  Interesting.
[07:47.980 --> 07:49.160]  Nick, Nick, I don't Nick.
[07:49.320 --> 07:51.560]  I don't want to sack you on what you're doing or whatever.
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.080]  You should should ask questions that you know the answer to.
[07:56.660 --> 07:58.400]  Why? I know the answer.
[07:58.720 --> 08:00.900]  That's why I'm I'm hooming to myself.
[08:01.080 --> 08:01.820]  Let me see.
[08:02.600 --> 08:06.480]  I've decided, Andrew, that it was not Eric or Geoff.
[08:06.940 --> 08:09.220]  OK, I will note that.
[08:09.220 --> 08:12.540]  And then I will reveal at the end of the episode
[08:12.540 --> 08:14.580]  what was right and what was wrong.
[08:14.840 --> 08:17.460]  Oh, I'm feeling very confident in my decision right now.
[08:18.180 --> 08:19.560]  I'm so confident.
[08:19.860 --> 08:20.680]  This game's great.
[08:21.440 --> 08:23.260]  This is burger confidence, baby.
[08:23.800 --> 08:25.380]  But I'm not putting a pencil in the line.
[08:25.640 --> 08:27.400]  Is that good?
[08:28.160 --> 08:29.100]  No, I don't know.
[08:29.220 --> 08:29.780]  Now I'm scared.
[08:30.320 --> 08:31.880]  We're doing this category again.
[08:32.300 --> 08:34.160]  OK, OK, OK.
[08:34.300 --> 08:35.320]  A movie I love.
[08:35.920 --> 08:37.200]  Mission Impossible three.
[08:37.540 --> 08:38.700]  It's my movie.
[08:38.700 --> 08:42.200]  My favorite fucking action movie, Mission Impossible three.
[08:42.320 --> 08:46.400]  The movie I lost my car to Gavin over because I got Kerry Russell wrong.
[08:46.900 --> 08:50.360]  This is the movie that has two or three of the best moments.
[08:50.440 --> 08:53.140]  And no, actually, three of the best moments in the history of film
[08:53.140 --> 08:56.980]  when they break into the Vatican and Ving Ring pops up and he sees
[08:56.980 --> 08:59.500]  he sees Mission Impossible there, Tom Cruise.
[08:59.820 --> 09:01.600]  And he goes, so with you, he goes nothing.
[09:01.740 --> 09:03.080]  So with you, he goes nothing.
[09:03.260 --> 09:05.980]  And then when they go to break into the Burj Khalifa or whatever
[09:05.980 --> 09:07.920]  and they're like, all right, here's the plan, we're going to go in.
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.740]  And then the next scene, it cuts to just hear him on the walkie talkie going,
[09:10.820 --> 09:12.320]  I'm not going to make the extraction point.
[09:12.360 --> 09:13.400]  I'm not going to make the extraction point.
[09:13.500 --> 09:16.180]  He jumps out the fucking building and you have no idea
[09:16.180 --> 09:18.020]  what happened inside of that building.
[09:18.200 --> 09:19.720]  We still don't get to know.
[09:19.860 --> 09:22.280]  My mind has been wondering what that I want a movie
[09:22.280 --> 09:23.600]  just out of what happened in that building.
[09:23.680 --> 09:27.000]  And I bet you would be two hours of fucking kick ass Tom Cruise action.
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.960]  And then at the end, when his wife, the Monaghan lady, when he's
[09:31.960 --> 09:34.200]  there, like sitting there after the long running scene, and he's like,
[09:34.260 --> 09:36.440]  if you don't, he needs to hurt a fucking shotgun to death.
[09:36.440 --> 09:39.120]  And he's like, if you don't kill me, I'm going to die,
[09:39.260 --> 09:41.280]  which is the coolest thing I've ever heard anybody say.
[09:41.360 --> 09:42.200]  That's why I picked that movie.
[09:42.600 --> 09:44.280]  Hey, Nick, let me make this easy for you.
[09:44.400 --> 09:45.560]  That's Andrew's favorite movie.
[09:46.240 --> 09:46.440]  Huh?
[09:47.600 --> 09:49.920]  It's an interesting strategy that you've employed there, Eric.
[09:50.300 --> 09:52.720]  I'm I'm letting you know,
[09:53.440 --> 09:56.260]  Geoff simply remembers it because of the Gavin bet.
[09:56.460 --> 09:57.800]  It's not his favorite movie.
[09:57.900 --> 09:59.960]  It's a movie he remembers kind of.
[10:00.100 --> 10:01.680]  It is Andrew's favorite movie.
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.320]  So the category is definitely favorite movie, not a movie that you love.
[10:05.320 --> 10:08.820]  No, it was a movie that other people might not associate with you,
[10:08.920 --> 10:09.540]  is what I was told.
[10:10.240 --> 10:13.980]  OK. Otherwise, I would have picked Harold and Maude or Empire Strikes Back.
[10:14.060 --> 10:17.020]  But I feel like I've said both of those many times in content.
[10:17.620 --> 10:21.660]  I will say he said he's talked about Mission Impossible three so much in content.
[10:21.900 --> 10:24.600]  Geoff, how could you have such a warm memory
[10:25.120 --> 10:28.380]  and make it your favorite movie when it's something that cost you your car?
[10:28.820 --> 10:31.100]  Because Gavin and I have fake bets all day long
[10:32.020 --> 10:34.600]  and he doesn't have a driver's license, so he can't use it.
[10:34.600 --> 10:35.720]  It's a fair point.
[10:35.920 --> 10:36.520]  Could he repo it?
[10:36.660 --> 10:38.260]  I'm not. That's not a question. I'm not asking that.
[10:42.120 --> 10:43.340]  Geoff, what was the item
[10:43.340 --> 10:45.720]  that Philip Seymour Hoffman's character was after in the movie?
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.580]  He was after the the football or the briefcase or whatever the fuck they call it.
[10:49.620 --> 10:52.080]  You never really know what it is for most of the movie,
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.380]  but I think it was some sort of a nerve agent in a canister.
[10:59.440 --> 11:00.160]  Andrew? Yes.
[11:00.260 --> 11:01.020]  I've made my decision.
[11:01.440 --> 11:02.780]  You've made your decision. OK.
[11:02.780 --> 11:04.580]  I've made my decision. Or Nick?
[11:04.960 --> 11:06.880]  It was neither of these two.
[11:07.380 --> 11:08.720]  Either of them. OK.
[11:09.700 --> 11:13.640]  You are moving on to the next category.
[11:14.540 --> 11:16.680]  Movie I hate. Now, this is an interesting one.
[11:17.280 --> 11:20.820]  Now, the movie that Nick picked for his hated movie
[11:21.350 --> 11:23.320]  was picked by somebody else as well.
[11:23.820 --> 11:25.280]  Oh, wow.
[11:25.820 --> 11:28.780]  So, Nick, you're going to have to determine who hates this
[11:28.780 --> 11:31.660]  to the point in which they'd list it as much as you do.
[11:32.420 --> 11:35.520]  My hated movie is Napoleon Dynamite.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.080]  That's my pick.
[11:39.080 --> 11:43.320]  Fucking Napoleon Dynamite is a Jack Petillo special.
[11:43.680 --> 11:48.420]  I was working with him when that movie came out and much like I love Jack to death,
[11:48.420 --> 11:52.140]  but much like he did with Breaking Bad, he just talked it to death.
[11:52.520 --> 11:56.440]  He was like obsessed with that Uncle Rico dude because he was in a movie
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.860]  called Pinballs from the early 80s.
[11:58.860 --> 12:02.900]  And for a brief period of time when he was in like that interning,
[12:02.960 --> 12:05.420]  but like working with Rooster Teeth before he worked with us full time,
[12:05.860 --> 12:10.320]  he he acquired the license to that film and was trying to get a remake made.
[12:10.720 --> 12:14.000]  And he supposedly had that guy, Uncle Rico or Johnny Rico,
[12:14.060 --> 12:16.600]  or the fuck his name was, the guy that threw the football to agree,
[12:16.720 --> 12:17.960]  agree to be in the movie already.
[12:18.060 --> 12:19.760]  And he was just trying to find funding for it.
[12:19.860 --> 12:23.540]  And so there was like a year and a half where all I heard about was
[12:23.980 --> 12:24.700]  Napoleon Dynamite.
[12:24.760 --> 12:27.240]  And I didn't like the movie to begin with, but it really wore me down.
[12:27.240 --> 12:29.580]  So that's Nick, we're Nick, we're around the same age.
[12:29.600 --> 12:33.300]  And I did not know that you hated Napoleon Dynamite the same way that I do.
[12:33.540 --> 12:36.080]  It was you couldn't escape it in high school.
[12:36.420 --> 12:39.060]  Everyone wearing the stupid fucking T-shirt
[12:39.060 --> 12:41.780]  and quoting every stupid line from that movie.
[12:42.300 --> 12:45.920]  Genuinely, this is my most despised film of all time.
[12:46.220 --> 12:50.720]  I have tried to watch it two times and both times.
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.480]  I'm going, I can't believe that anyone fucking made this.
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.680]  I can't believe anybody's watching this.
[12:56.680 --> 12:59.860]  Is this a low budget joke being pulled on me?
[12:59.980 --> 13:03.120]  I genuinely despise Napoleon Dynamite.
[13:03.220 --> 13:07.340]  And I hate what it I hate what it did for movies after it,
[13:07.580 --> 13:11.180]  because it just became, dude, if you put on a vote for Pedro shirt,
[13:11.240 --> 13:11.980]  that's a reference.
[13:11.980 --> 13:15.260]  And then this fucking John Heder guy is never in anything else
[13:15.260 --> 13:16.240]  that was like worthwhile.
[13:16.700 --> 13:20.640]  He he's what in blades of glory get real.
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.740]  And Napoleon, Napoleon Dynamite sucks shit.
[13:24.740 --> 13:26.080]  I agree with Geoff.
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.580]  If it's a Jack Sparrow special that really that really adds another layer for me.
[13:31.580 --> 13:36.820]  But dude, I cannot stand genuinely despise that.
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.800]  I'm honestly I'm so excited to talk to you next week about how we both hate
[13:41.800 --> 13:45.400]  that movie when we record 100 percent heat, because I didn't know
[13:45.400 --> 13:46.660]  you hated this movie also.
[13:46.660 --> 13:47.900]  And this fucking rules.
[13:47.920 --> 13:49.240]  I'm very excited.
[13:49.540 --> 13:51.840]  I'm so as a hater, as a hater.
[13:51.840 --> 13:53.660]  I'm so excited to talk to you about this.
[13:53.660 --> 13:58.460]  I'm not particularly excited to talk to you about how much I hate Napoleon Dynamite
[13:58.460 --> 14:00.780]  because we just did it and I don't want to give it any more oxygen.
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.240]  But I will say it was a tough decision between that movie
[14:03.240 --> 14:05.060]  and anything Edgar Wright has directed.
[14:05.220 --> 14:06.120]  Oh, I get that.
[14:06.460 --> 14:07.300]  Interesting, Nick.
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.560]  I want you to know that as a hater, all I want to do is use oxygen
[14:11.560 --> 14:13.820]  on talking about how much I hate this fucking movie.
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.820]  God, this one, this is so much tougher than the other two.
[14:16.900 --> 14:19.460]  Let me tell you, because oh, talk about something you love
[14:19.460 --> 14:20.640]  versus talk about something you hate.
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.820]  So believable, because one, you're both in on it.
[14:24.920 --> 14:27.020]  Two, totally believable about Jack.
[14:27.080 --> 14:28.360]  I heard him talk about Breaking Bad.
[14:28.440 --> 14:28.940]  I know how he felt.
[14:30.140 --> 14:32.740]  And then on the other side, Eric, you are my age.
[14:33.220 --> 14:35.220]  I know how you feel about things like this.
[14:36.180 --> 14:39.560]  And the question basically is, I believe you both do not like that movie.
[14:39.660 --> 14:44.960]  I do not know that if it's right, obviously one of your most hated movies.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.340]  Yeah, it is my most hated movie.
[14:46.520 --> 14:48.740]  It is genuinely my my most.
[14:48.740 --> 14:50.420]  I'm so excited that you listed it.
[14:50.740 --> 14:52.200]  Also, this fucking rocks.
[14:52.320 --> 14:53.400]  I'm so excited.
[14:53.820 --> 14:57.560]  The only reason I picked it, Nick, is because I hate that
[14:57.560 --> 15:01.060]  that driving movie he did, Edgar Wright,
[15:01.560 --> 15:04.620]  equally as much as the stupid ex-girlfriend movie.
[15:04.800 --> 15:07.400]  And I couldn't if if he had only directed one of those,
[15:07.440 --> 15:09.720]  I probably would have picked it, but because they kind of canceled
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.400]  each other out, which is why I picked Napoleon Dynamite.
[15:11.500 --> 15:12.480]  Interesting. Interesting.
[15:12.780 --> 15:16.100]  Actually, Eric, what would you if you couldn't have picked this?
[15:16.100 --> 15:17.200]  What would you have picked as your?
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.880]  Oh, my God. Or your most hated movie?
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.300]  I don't I I genuinely don't know, because it this was the movie
[15:24.300 --> 15:28.280]  that when I read it and it said, what's a movie you hate?
[15:28.340 --> 15:31.040]  Napoleon Dynamite was the only thing that came to mind.
[15:31.940 --> 15:35.260]  I don't know that I have another movie that is on this level
[15:35.260 --> 15:36.360]  or even approaching it.
[15:36.840 --> 15:39.380]  I do believe it's the one of the two of you, because I think that
[15:39.990 --> 15:41.580]  I think Andrew is ambivalent to it.
[15:41.620 --> 15:42.300]  And I'll bet Gavin.
[15:43.200 --> 15:44.180]  I think I bet.
[15:44.180 --> 15:45.600]  See, here's the thing.
[15:45.700 --> 15:47.300]  I wouldn't be surprised if Gavin never saw it.
[15:47.560 --> 15:51.100]  I bet. I bet Gavin saw it and it was sort of like whatever.
[15:51.460 --> 15:52.980]  I think Andrew probably enjoyed it.
[15:53.060 --> 15:56.360]  And I don't fault him for that because he's not wearing a Verso Pedro shirt.
[15:58.040 --> 15:59.340]  Man. Or he never saw it.
[15:59.500 --> 16:00.520]  And don't think so. For Pedro.
[16:01.480 --> 16:02.720]  I don't I don't think he did.
[16:02.900 --> 16:04.040]  No, it is an election year.
[16:04.440 --> 16:05.200]  How many times?
[16:05.440 --> 16:07.060]  How many times have you tried to watch it?
[16:07.480 --> 16:08.700]  Two times. Right.
[16:08.820 --> 16:09.720]  And I've never finished it.
[16:09.820 --> 16:13.320]  I've never finished it. Dude, you just you get to a point where you go,
[16:13.320 --> 16:15.180]  hey, enough's enough of this.
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.600]  God, I I don't even know what to ask because this is like I feel
[16:19.600 --> 16:22.060]  I feel like a real camaraderie with you two right now.
[16:23.060 --> 16:24.380]  Like a real kill.
[16:24.420 --> 16:26.640]  So I'm going to go off of brain power here, OK?
[16:27.240 --> 16:31.040]  I'm putting it out in the universe and I'm sorry, Geoff, but I'm picking Eric.
[16:31.120 --> 16:32.200]  I think this is Eric's least favorite.
[16:32.240 --> 16:33.960]  Hey, man, it's your it's your mistake.
[16:34.200 --> 16:34.620]  That's OK.
[16:35.200 --> 16:37.180]  You don't want to wind up at the end of this thing.
[16:37.260 --> 16:37.960]  You don't get one.
[16:42.850 --> 16:46.850]  Next category, same question type, different movie.
[16:47.370 --> 16:50.010]  My hated movie is Armageddon.
[16:50.210 --> 16:52.710]  This is my most hated movie.
[16:53.270 --> 16:57.410]  I don't really even know what to say about it other than I don't.
[16:57.490 --> 16:59.410]  I didn't like Ben Affleck at the time.
[16:59.490 --> 17:02.030]  I really a big I don't think I like anybody in the film, actually,
[17:02.510 --> 17:03.730]  except for Bruce Willis.
[17:03.850 --> 17:05.350]  I thought the premise was dumb.
[17:05.410 --> 17:08.290]  I thought Deep Impact was a better, more cerebral version of it.
[17:08.290 --> 17:09.810]  Everybody liked it.
[17:09.870 --> 17:12.770]  And I'm not even going to really spend a lot of time trying to convince you.
[17:12.930 --> 17:14.350]  I just fucking hated that film.
[17:14.690 --> 17:15.610]  I really did.
[17:15.810 --> 17:17.750]  Nick, I want to save you time here.
[17:17.930 --> 17:20.250]  It's not Geoff's. It is mine.
[17:22.490 --> 17:23.450]  All right.
[17:23.450 --> 17:27.270]  So I just I just spent so much time lying about Napoleon Dynamite
[17:27.270 --> 17:29.850]  because I don't have the energy to be truthful.
[17:30.550 --> 17:33.050]  That's why I'm telling you, you can't trust this guy.
[17:33.410 --> 17:34.270]  That's what I'm saying.
[17:34.430 --> 17:35.690]  You got to trust me here.
[17:36.130 --> 17:37.710]  He's playing the game. I understand.
[17:37.710 --> 17:39.250]  Yeah, exactly.
[17:39.430 --> 17:39.890]  He's right.
[17:40.010 --> 17:41.250]  We all know he's playing the game.
[17:41.270 --> 17:44.630]  The thing where he like does the animal cracker across
[17:44.630 --> 17:48.590]  Liv Tyler's stomach with his stupid Australian accent makes me.
[17:48.670 --> 17:49.930]  Oh, I hate that film.
[17:50.310 --> 17:51.670]  I hate the soundtrack.
[17:51.970 --> 17:52.770]  I hate Aerosmith.
[17:53.450 --> 17:54.870]  I don't know if you guys know that about me.
[17:55.010 --> 17:56.230]  I've never liked Aerosmith.
[17:56.430 --> 18:00.190]  I find them to be really...
[18:02.210 --> 18:03.090]  Disgusting is not the right word.
[18:03.110 --> 18:03.650]  That's too mean.
[18:03.750 --> 18:04.930]  But just like just icky.
[18:05.090 --> 18:06.170]  I don't like him. It bugs me.
[18:06.170 --> 18:08.970]  And they were so imbued with that stupid film.
[18:09.390 --> 18:13.030]  And and every asshole, I was in the army when that movie came out
[18:13.030 --> 18:16.110]  and every asshole in the army was fucking gung ho about it
[18:16.110 --> 18:17.570]  and thought it was super cool.
[18:17.770 --> 18:19.890]  And so it was it just plagued me.
[18:21.650 --> 18:23.850]  Again, I'm just going to be really clear.
[18:24.030 --> 18:25.550]  This is it's not Geoff's.
[18:25.630 --> 18:27.910]  Well, let me ask you this, then, Eric, who's would it be?
[18:28.030 --> 18:31.930]  I think it's it's I think it's boy, I want to say it's Gavin's.
[18:32.510 --> 18:35.490]  It wouldn't surprise me if it was Andrew's, but it's definitely
[18:35.490 --> 18:39.550]  if you don't pick me here, you're given you're given, Eric, a point, I think.
[18:40.090 --> 18:41.570]  No, I don't think I don't know.
[18:41.590 --> 18:42.590]  OK, well, in that case, no.
[18:42.690 --> 18:45.850]  Yeah, then I don't know why he would be trying to dissuade you from scoring.
[18:46.030 --> 18:47.290]  It's it's definitely me.
[18:47.850 --> 18:48.890]  It's definitely not Geoff.
[18:49.150 --> 18:52.870]  I the only reason I was able to bitch so much about Napoleon Dynamite
[18:52.870 --> 18:55.490]  is is because I would have picked that movie had it come to my mind.
[18:55.770 --> 18:57.030]  I'm different than Eric.
[18:57.050 --> 18:58.370]  I hate lots of stuff.
[18:58.650 --> 18:59.750]  And I can call.
[18:59.870 --> 19:02.150]  Yeah, you know, I'm a serial liker.
[19:02.470 --> 19:04.210]  Yeah, you know, I like I'm not.
[19:04.210 --> 19:06.370]  I'm not a guy who's like, what's your what's a movie you hate?
[19:06.410 --> 19:07.810]  And I'm like, oh, I can only think of one.
[19:07.930 --> 19:10.510]  I can think of volumes of films that I hate.
[19:12.050 --> 19:15.290]  Napoleon Dynamite didn't come to mind, but you know, it's not Geoff did.
[19:15.730 --> 19:17.390]  And so that's the one I picked.
[19:18.070 --> 19:21.590]  If this was really Geoff's, he wouldn't be able to be an Edgar Wright film.
[19:21.870 --> 19:24.410]  Here's if if this was really Geoff's, he wouldn't.
[19:25.050 --> 19:27.990]  It would be so with so much more fervor that he hates it.
[19:28.090 --> 19:29.150]  It's just I'm just tired.
[19:29.630 --> 19:30.930]  It's 100 percent mine.
[19:31.030 --> 19:32.310]  I picked Armageddon, Nick.
[19:32.310 --> 19:35.650]  Dude, I'm telling you, fucking buddy to buddy,
[19:36.470 --> 19:39.190]  basketball fan to basketball fan, if you pick me here, you're going to.
[19:39.310 --> 19:40.150]  We're both going to get a point.
[19:40.570 --> 19:41.150]  Geoff likes Armageddon.
[19:41.230 --> 19:42.570]  I think Geoff likes Armageddon.
[19:42.610 --> 19:43.690]  I get nothing.
[19:43.830 --> 19:46.490]  I get nothing for for tricking you, do I?
[19:47.090 --> 19:48.130]  Yeah, you do. You get a point.
[19:48.470 --> 19:49.530]  Oh, well, I'm not trying to trick you.
[19:49.590 --> 19:50.510]  I'm trying to get a point.
[19:51.290 --> 19:53.110]  So he's trying to trick you.
[19:53.130 --> 19:56.570]  And I'm telling you, it's like, well, why wouldn't Eric get a point?
[19:56.610 --> 19:58.570]  Well, Eric gets a point for tricking him.
[19:58.690 --> 20:02.070]  Well, no, he's Eric is not trying to convince him that it's his pick.
[20:02.070 --> 20:05.170]  He's trying to say that it's nobody's. Oh, right, right, right.
[20:05.270 --> 20:07.430]  Well, I'm trying to convince you that it's my pick because it is.
[20:07.550 --> 20:09.030]  It was not Napoleon Dynamite.
[20:09.170 --> 20:11.970]  I although I wish I'd thought of it because I do hate that movie
[20:11.970 --> 20:14.870]  as much as Armageddon and as much as Edgar Wright films
[20:14.870 --> 20:17.630]  and as much as a bunch of other films I could list.
[20:17.790 --> 20:19.650]  Hurley Burley, I left the theater in.
[20:19.770 --> 20:21.550]  I couldn't get through fucking 20 minutes of that film.
[20:22.390 --> 20:24.170]  But that didn't come to mind either.
[20:24.350 --> 20:25.570]  It was it was just Armageddon.
[20:25.710 --> 20:28.590]  Now, my concern here, Geoff, is that you mentioned
[20:28.590 --> 20:31.770]  if you hadn't thought of Napoleon Dynamite, you'd have gone with an Edgar Wright film.
[20:32.070 --> 20:36.670]  Yeah, because I thought I was just trying to come up with shit to to to convince you.
[20:36.790 --> 20:37.910]  I do hate Edgar Wright.
[20:38.010 --> 20:39.270]  You know what? I do hate Edgar Wright.
[20:39.370 --> 20:41.990]  And I wish I would have thought I really hate that Scott Pilgrim movie.
[20:42.870 --> 20:43.770]  And then I couldn't.
[20:43.830 --> 20:46.070]  And I actually thought in my head, I think I hate Scott Pilgrim
[20:46.070 --> 20:47.130]  more than Napoleon Dynamite.
[20:47.390 --> 20:48.090]  So how do I?
[20:48.150 --> 20:51.150]  I had to justify it to myself by saying, well, I hate the Baby Driver movie
[20:51.150 --> 20:53.170]  as much as I hate Scott Pilgrim.
[20:53.230 --> 20:55.530]  So they cancel each other out so I could pick the Napoleon Dynamite.
[20:55.650 --> 20:58.390]  But that's all subterfuge because I really wrote down Armageddon.
[20:59.350 --> 21:01.010]  Andrew, Andrew, I've made my decision.
[21:01.010 --> 21:02.190]  You've made your choice, Nick.
[21:02.890 --> 21:04.770]  It is neither of these two gentlemen.
[21:04.870 --> 21:05.770]  You are fucking up, dude.
[21:07.370 --> 21:08.170]  Good choice, Nick.
[21:09.090 --> 21:09.690]  Thanks, man.
[21:10.210 --> 21:11.150]  Nick, you really fucked up.
[21:11.510 --> 21:13.930]  I'm so excited to talk to you about Napoleon Dynamite next week.
[21:13.930 --> 21:14.450]  You have no idea.
[21:14.850 --> 21:15.690]  I'm so fucking thrilled.
[21:16.010 --> 21:17.390]  I'm so I didn't know you didn't like it either.
[21:17.590 --> 21:19.950]  You might have picked right there, but you fucked up on this one.
[21:20.430 --> 21:24.450]  I have no idea if that's Eric or not, but Armageddon was me.
[21:25.270 --> 21:27.990]  Oh, well, oh, no, it wasn't.
[21:27.990 --> 21:31.390]  A song I love is any song by Madonna.
[21:31.570 --> 21:32.970]  That's me as well.
[21:33.630 --> 21:37.710]  I am an Madonna music
[21:39.950 --> 21:40.510]  unapologist.
[21:40.590 --> 21:43.150]  I love all of her music, her entire catalog.
[21:43.290 --> 21:46.530]  I considered getting a Madonna tattoo for the longest time.
[21:46.890 --> 21:48.130]  I thought that would be really funny.
[21:48.450 --> 21:51.070]  And then she got Instagram and it changed my mind.
[21:51.570 --> 21:53.310]  Instagram Madonna, I'm not as into.
[21:53.650 --> 21:55.570]  But Madonna's music, I absolutely love.
[21:55.670 --> 21:56.710]  I grew up with her.
[21:56.710 --> 22:02.470]  I got one of my first ever boners to the like a virgin live performance
[22:02.470 --> 22:05.410]  that she did at the MTV Music Awards back when I was like
[22:05.410 --> 22:08.570]  the age where I could first start popping boners.
[22:08.710 --> 22:11.810]  I have been enamored with her since Lucky Star,
[22:12.030 --> 22:14.210]  which is the first Madonna song I ever heard.
[22:14.430 --> 22:16.270]  And I have the Immaculate Collection.
[22:16.610 --> 22:19.470]  I beat off to the sex book in high school.
[22:19.610 --> 22:21.710]  Like I've been I've been a Madonna fan.
[22:21.870 --> 22:24.810]  My God, I regret asking this question.
[22:28.840 --> 22:30.900]  Eric, what's your response?
[22:31.540 --> 22:33.420]  That's absolutely, that's absolutely vile.
[22:33.620 --> 22:37.140]  I listed this because everything before 2003, Madonna is good.
[22:37.220 --> 22:41.000]  American Life is the last album that I think that you could really listen to
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.140]  all the way through and be like, oh, OK, because she started going
[22:43.140 --> 22:44.320]  confessions on the dance floor.
[22:44.460 --> 22:45.600]  And it's too throwback.
[22:45.740 --> 22:47.580]  When you have Ray of Light in 98.
[22:47.780 --> 22:48.420]  Here's the thing, Nick.
[22:48.480 --> 22:49.780]  Again, we're around the same age.
[22:50.900 --> 22:54.400]  VH1, gigantic in that time, an adult contemporary with Ray of Light
[22:54.400 --> 22:58.340]  and everything that she did around that time is huge.
[22:58.340 --> 23:02.920]  And so what happens there is you go back and you listen to True Blue,
[23:03.320 --> 23:04.520]  her first album.
[23:05.220 --> 23:08.060]  He is just making shit up right now to justify.
[23:08.560 --> 23:11.840]  He's just talking Madonna, but he's not talking about why he likes Madonna.
[23:12.080 --> 23:15.660]  I'm telling you why I picked Madonna, because I love Madonna,
[23:15.900 --> 23:20.600]  because I have been in love with Madonna since I was able to be in love with women.
[23:20.960 --> 23:23.720]  And she was like she was the coolest.
[23:24.020 --> 23:25.920]  She was the Lady Gaga of her era.
[23:25.920 --> 23:29.600]  And my entire life, Madonna has been up until very recently
[23:29.600 --> 23:32.640]  has been like at the top of her game.
[23:32.760 --> 23:35.020]  And I have been a fan the entire time.
[23:35.180 --> 23:37.400]  I fucking stayed up to watch the stupid.
[23:38.920 --> 23:43.740]  What was the the Pepsi commercial video that caused so much trouble?
[23:43.800 --> 23:44.300]  What was that?
[23:45.280 --> 23:48.420]  Where she kissed Jesus and Jesus was black and everybody got upset.
[23:49.100 --> 23:51.220]  I even stayed up late on a Sunday night to watch that.
[23:51.320 --> 23:53.200]  I've been such a Madonna fan my entire life.
[23:53.820 --> 23:54.960]  I wish I got that tattoo now.
[23:54.960 --> 23:58.120]  Nick, here's some examples.
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.020]  What I'm telling you is that Madonna is someone that has been in the zeitgeist
[24:04.020 --> 24:07.860]  for so long that I'm tweeting about Madonna.
[24:08.360 --> 24:12.380]  I'm telling you that Carly Rae Jepsen is just Madonna
[24:12.380 --> 24:15.080]  for people that never listened to her first album,
[24:15.180 --> 24:18.520]  that don't know Physical Attraction, Holiday, Burning Up and Borderline.
[24:18.620 --> 24:19.620]  I don't think that's right at all.
[24:19.620 --> 24:21.900]  Geoff is going to talk about, oh, yeah, Lucky Star.
[24:22.040 --> 24:22.740]  Wow. Cool, man.
[24:22.740 --> 24:25.620]  The first song on the first album, Deep Cut.
[24:25.720 --> 24:28.480]  Yeah, since the fucking first day I've been a Madonna fan.
[24:28.480 --> 24:31.700]  Grow up and listen to Bedtime Stories, stupid ho.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.180]  You got to get deep on this shit.
[24:34.300 --> 24:37.560]  When I'm saying anything by Madonna,
[24:37.900 --> 24:41.640]  I mean Secret Human Nature, Forbidden Love, Sanctuary.
[24:41.900 --> 24:44.360]  Bedtime Stories, Deep Cut shit.
[24:45.040 --> 24:46.360]  Eric would have picked a song or an album.
[24:46.560 --> 24:47.540]  I picked a whole catalog.
[24:47.920 --> 24:48.600]  He wouldn't have done that.
[24:48.660 --> 24:52.180]  He's too specific and he's too like, he's too persnickety about it.
[24:52.180 --> 24:53.680]  Eric would have told you a song.
[24:53.760 --> 24:55.480]  He would have just said this song by Madonna.
[24:55.860 --> 24:58.700]  I picked her entire catalog because I love Madonna.
[24:58.840 --> 25:00.260]  Anything by Madonna is what I said.
[25:01.380 --> 25:04.340]  Now, I don't even, I'm not even going to ask a question.
[25:04.480 --> 25:05.060]  And here's why.
[25:05.740 --> 25:06.840]  You're both very passionate.
[25:07.320 --> 25:09.020]  So I believe that it's one of the two of you.
[25:09.260 --> 25:14.480]  However, since the answer was all Madonna songs or like anything by Madonna,
[25:14.680 --> 25:18.520]  I think Eric saying anything after 2003, not to be as big a fan of.
[25:18.760 --> 25:20.020]  I'm going to go with Geoff on this one.
[25:20.600 --> 25:21.360]  All right.
[25:21.420 --> 25:22.220]  That is your decision?
[25:22.720 --> 25:22.980]  You blew it.
[25:23.020 --> 25:23.780]  That is my decision.
[25:24.440 --> 25:24.760]  All right.
[25:24.920 --> 25:27.560]  I'm glad you guys aren't revealing it to me because it's really making me sweat.
[25:27.940 --> 25:29.220]  Yeah, well, you should pick right.
[25:29.300 --> 25:30.160]  I don't know what to tell you.
[25:30.460 --> 25:31.160]  I agree with Eric.
[25:31.220 --> 25:32.120]  You got to start picking right.
[25:32.520 --> 25:37.800]  Dude, borderline is maybe one of the best songs ever fucking written.
[25:38.240 --> 25:40.640]  And you picked Geoff. Get real.
[25:41.040 --> 25:42.340]  It's because he knows the right answer.
[25:43.040 --> 25:43.800]  Next category.
[25:44.600 --> 25:47.200]  A song I hate is Hurt So Good.
[25:47.200 --> 25:54.640]  Uh, I don't even know what that song, Hurt So Good.
[25:55.580 --> 25:56.740]  I can't even lie.
[25:56.820 --> 25:58.420]  Come on, baby, make it hurt so good.
[25:58.420 --> 25:58.820]  Exactly.
[26:00.520 --> 26:01.560]  John Mellencamp.
[26:01.780 --> 26:04.480]  Hey, we're going to call you John Cougar Mellencamp.
[26:04.780 --> 26:06.180]  What a fucking dipshit.
[26:06.360 --> 26:09.300]  You talk about a guy who's been around for too long
[26:09.300 --> 26:11.140]  and it was only a short amount of time.
[26:11.400 --> 26:14.760]  It's John Cougar Mellencamp.
[26:15.140 --> 26:17.340]  Hurt so good sucks shit.
[26:17.820 --> 26:20.300]  I fucking hate that song.
[26:20.800 --> 26:21.900]  I think that sucks.
[26:22.160 --> 26:23.520]  Here's the problem with that song.
[26:23.840 --> 26:28.020]  It's a karaoke staple and it fucking shouldn't be.
[26:28.140 --> 26:32.100]  The problem with karaoke songs is that it's like, oh, yeah, you got to
[26:32.100 --> 26:34.420]  you got to pick stuff that people know and everything.
[26:34.560 --> 26:35.720]  Great. Pick Jack and Diane.
[26:36.280 --> 26:38.480]  Pick anything that isn't.
[26:38.580 --> 26:40.940]  Pick R.O.C.K. in the USA.
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.140]  Pick anything that isn't fucking hurt so good.
[26:45.140 --> 26:47.880]  John Cougar Mellencamp sucks shit.
[26:48.140 --> 26:52.120]  That's the dirt worst fucking song in the world.
[26:53.800 --> 26:56.080]  Oh, no, it's not.
[26:56.200 --> 26:57.740]  It's not me. I can't.
[26:57.800 --> 26:59.400]  I can't pretend not to like that song.
[26:59.460 --> 27:01.780]  I couldn't even call it to my mind when I was thinking of it.
[27:01.900 --> 27:04.580]  So it could be Eric. I don't know.
[27:05.220 --> 27:08.080]  I will say I've never heard anybody sing that song in karaoke,
[27:08.120 --> 27:09.540]  and I've heard a lot of karaoke.
[27:09.760 --> 27:10.520]  I don't know why.
[27:10.660 --> 27:13.440]  I don't know why he he brought the karaoke part up.
[27:13.440 --> 27:15.620]  Look at this motherfucker.
[27:16.100 --> 27:18.980]  I hate I hate this.
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.480]  So it's the fakest bullshit.
[27:21.660 --> 27:22.500]  Oh, I hate it.
[27:22.540 --> 27:24.360]  Fuck. Look it.
[27:24.420 --> 27:25.920]  Oh, he sucks.
[27:26.020 --> 27:29.580]  Now, I'm fairly in tune with with Eric's music taste
[27:30.150 --> 27:33.280]  because I'm also a big fan of yacht rock and, you know, newer stuff.
[27:33.380 --> 27:34.160]  I'll give a chance to.
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.060]  But this song I also despise.
[27:36.140 --> 27:38.120]  So I am leaning towards Eric at the moment.
[27:38.200 --> 27:40.640]  But I would like to know, Eric, where
[27:41.400 --> 27:45.520]  if you had to pick any other song that you hated off the top of your head right now,
[27:45.640 --> 27:47.480]  just without hesitating, what is it?
[27:47.560 --> 27:48.120]  Sweet Caroline.
[27:48.860 --> 27:50.100]  Fuck. It's you.
[27:50.580 --> 27:53.160]  See? Like, Nick,
[27:53.460 --> 27:58.640]  these are songs that are drunk karaoke staples that suck shit.
[27:59.720 --> 28:00.260]  These are.
[28:00.400 --> 28:01.640]  Well, they sucked when they started.
[28:01.880 --> 28:02.600]  Exactly. Exactly.
[28:02.680 --> 28:03.420]  That's the problem.
[28:03.700 --> 28:06.140]  It hurts so good is the type of song.
[28:06.240 --> 28:08.800]  I still have never heard anybody sing that in karaoke.
[28:09.320 --> 28:12.360]  Hurt so good is a drunk mom karaoke song
[28:12.360 --> 28:14.920]  where she knows the chorus and none of the verse.
[28:15.360 --> 28:17.940]  Yeah. Uh-huh.
[28:18.060 --> 28:20.040]  That's it. I'm going with Eric, Andrew.
[28:20.160 --> 28:20.660]  I'm going with Eric.
[28:20.840 --> 28:22.060]  Your choice is Eric.
[28:22.920 --> 28:25.340]  All right. Next category.
[28:26.160 --> 28:27.300]  TV show I love.
[28:27.940 --> 28:29.900]  Oh, interesting. Friends.
[28:30.620 --> 28:31.460]  This is me.
[28:31.960 --> 28:35.940]  I picked this because I'm just going to let Geoff wear himself out
[28:35.940 --> 28:37.800]  so that way I can actually talk about this guy.
[28:37.800 --> 28:40.100]  I picked this. I'm just going to be honest with you.
[28:40.160 --> 28:41.040]  I'll just get out of the way real quick.
[28:41.100 --> 28:44.760]  And then Eric can yell and scream and talk for a long time and say very little.
[28:45.460 --> 28:49.920]  But what I'm going to say is I once again, Andrew asked me to pick a show
[28:49.920 --> 28:52.180]  that I like, that people don't think I like.
[28:52.220 --> 28:54.220]  And I have a bit of an embarrassing
[28:56.020 --> 28:56.380]  admission.
[28:56.640 --> 28:58.960]  I have always considered myself a Seinfeld guy,
[28:59.800 --> 29:02.320]  and I have always kind of shit on Friends.
[29:02.420 --> 29:05.340]  But it's because I never really watched it until I met Emily.
[29:05.760 --> 29:08.220]  And she is kind of quietly a big Friends fan.
[29:08.380 --> 29:10.660]  And so it's always kind of been on in the background.
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.580]  And I discovered begrudgingly over the past seven years
[29:14.580 --> 29:17.820]  that I it was a pretty good show and I don't like to talk about it
[29:17.820 --> 29:20.320]  because I don't want Bernie and Matt and Gavin specifically
[29:20.760 --> 29:23.940]  to make fun of me for all the years I shit talked it to them.
[29:24.120 --> 29:25.440]  So I wrote that down.
[29:25.540 --> 29:27.740]  It is me. And that's all I'm going to say.
[29:27.800 --> 29:29.040]  I'll answer any questions you want.
[29:29.140 --> 29:31.700]  But I wouldn't say I'm like the biggest fan in the world of it or anything.
[29:31.700 --> 29:34.360]  I just I'm embarrassed.
[29:34.520 --> 29:38.540]  But I feel like if we're going to be embarrassed, we should admit it on camera.
[29:38.700 --> 29:39.860]  That's kind of what we do here.
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.060]  So I am a late in life Friends fan.
[29:43.280 --> 29:44.720]  Thanks to my wife, Emily.
[29:45.340 --> 29:46.840]  I own the cassette.
[29:47.940 --> 29:50.500]  From Marcel the Monkey to Ms.
[29:50.880 --> 29:56.520]  Chanandler Bong, Friends is probably one of my favorite TV shows,
[29:56.600 --> 29:59.000]  and I don't really care that people know or not.
[29:59.560 --> 30:02.440]  I I loved watching Friends when it first aired again.
[30:02.820 --> 30:04.860]  Again, around the same age, Nick.
[30:05.140 --> 30:06.660]  Way too young to be watching Friends.
[30:06.920 --> 30:08.840]  Still watched it all the time.
[30:09.300 --> 30:10.360]  I love Friends.
[30:10.740 --> 30:12.440]  Again, I own the cassette.
[30:12.740 --> 30:17.260]  Has a has, I think, a Barenaked Ladies song on it or maybe two.
[30:17.600 --> 30:19.540]  And it is.
[30:19.900 --> 30:20.820]  Shouldn't have owned it.
[30:21.020 --> 30:24.220]  Shouldn't have watched the show at the tender age of probably nine.
[30:24.960 --> 30:27.240]  I don't think that the last season
[30:28.000 --> 30:29.020]  is very good.
[30:29.460 --> 30:32.300]  I guess the last two with Paul Rudd, those suck shit.
[30:32.640 --> 30:34.320]  But the rest of it, I think it's great.
[30:34.420 --> 30:38.040]  I think through the first five seasons, Friends is such a strong TV show.
[30:38.200 --> 30:38.580]  It's great.
[30:39.060 --> 30:40.380]  It is. It is me.
[30:40.760 --> 30:43.020]  I I really wish I still had this cassette.
[30:43.600 --> 30:46.140]  Just remember, Nick, it can't be Eric every time.
[30:46.280 --> 30:47.840]  There are four other answers out there.
[30:47.900 --> 30:48.500]  It's true.
[30:48.580 --> 30:51.840]  But you also have to think about how Andrew is gaming this thing
[30:51.840 --> 30:53.060]  to kind of screw with your head.
[30:53.720 --> 30:55.600]  Oh, yeah, it is. Let me tell you, it is.
[30:56.560 --> 30:58.700]  So how many seasons did the show run, Eric?
[30:58.880 --> 31:01.980]  Ten. Remember the last season where they're all making over a million
[31:01.980 --> 31:03.020]  because they weren't going to do it?
[31:03.660 --> 31:06.820]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:06.820 --> 31:09.000]  What was your what was your favorite arc, Eric?
[31:10.080 --> 31:12.420]  Remember when it's the end of season?
[31:12.760 --> 31:15.080]  Boy, is it the end of season two or the end of season three
[31:15.080 --> 31:20.700]  where Ben Stiller's wife is in it as Bonnie and then she's dating Ross
[31:20.700 --> 31:24.120]  and they go to the beach and then Rachel convinces her to shave her head?
[31:24.120 --> 31:26.620]  It's the sort of like Ross, Rachel.
[31:26.760 --> 31:28.740]  Oh, he's her lobster, like that kind of thing.
[31:28.960 --> 31:31.040]  I think that's probably like my favorite end of the season,
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.940]  beginning of the season moment with that.
[31:34.360 --> 31:36.620]  Also, I like when when Ross had the pants.
[31:37.820 --> 31:39.360]  Oh, yeah, the leather pants.
[31:39.640 --> 31:41.700]  And he tries to pull them up and he hits himself in the face.
[31:41.740 --> 31:42.200]  That's funny.
[31:42.820 --> 31:44.900]  Geoff, what was your favorite outside of that one?
[31:44.960 --> 31:45.700]  So you can't pick that one.
[31:45.760 --> 31:49.980]  If you could, what is your next favorite arc in the show?
[31:50.420 --> 31:52.000]  Oh, dude, I can't sit.
[31:52.000 --> 31:55.340]  I couldn't name you an arc for Seinfeld or Friends right now.
[31:55.420 --> 31:57.980]  It's a TV show that's on in the background that when I look at,
[31:58.040 --> 32:00.140]  I enjoy and I get like dumb laughs at.
[32:00.660 --> 32:03.300]  I guess I yeah, I don't really know.
[32:03.420 --> 32:04.700]  I don't like I'll be honest.
[32:04.700 --> 32:06.160]  I didn't even know that Paul Rudd was in the show.
[32:06.240 --> 32:07.480]  I may not have seen those seasons.
[32:07.500 --> 32:10.460]  So it's just kind of like it's kind of like a background show for me.
[32:10.600 --> 32:13.100]  She watches Veep and she watches Friends.
[32:13.400 --> 32:15.180]  And so it's always one of those two shows.
[32:15.280 --> 32:16.560]  I like Veep a lot.
[32:16.680 --> 32:18.940]  I also probably couldn't tell you any Veep storylines
[32:18.940 --> 32:21.480]  because it's not something I like sit down and focus on.
[32:21.480 --> 32:24.300]  I definitely didn't own a tape like Eric or anything,
[32:24.300 --> 32:28.500]  but it's just a show that I told people I hated and I hated it
[32:28.500 --> 32:29.520]  because I'd never seen it.
[32:29.700 --> 32:32.140]  And then I watched it, you know, begrudgingly.
[32:32.200 --> 32:33.460]  And I like it.
[32:33.760 --> 32:37.080]  I don't like it enough to remember fucking whole seasons or anything, though.
[32:37.360 --> 32:40.660]  Hey, remember when Chandler was in the ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre?
[32:41.300 --> 32:43.700]  Oh, yeah. I was going to ask you what your favorite cameo is.
[32:43.840 --> 32:46.880]  It's probably that it's that or it's you also mentioned Paul Rudd.
[32:46.960 --> 32:49.760]  Yeah, I think I think Janice coming back over and over again.
[32:49.760 --> 32:51.760]  That's pretty good. Tag. Tag sucked.
[32:52.340 --> 32:54.660]  I hated Tag. Oh, he was the worst.
[32:54.760 --> 32:57.260]  Yeah, he was born too young. Yeah. Big time. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:59.180 --> 33:00.880]  Now I here's my issue.
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.380]  I know I believe didn't Gavin have like DVDs of this?
[33:04.700 --> 33:07.180]  He's a huge, huge fan, but he's but he.
[33:07.620 --> 33:10.300]  So I don't think he would say I'm a friend of this.
[33:10.400 --> 33:14.500]  I'm a fan of this show on a question that says secretly. Right.
[33:14.700 --> 33:15.920]  Yeah, I agree. He wouldn't just.
[33:18.600 --> 33:19.840]  Oh, it's too obvious.
[33:19.960 --> 33:22.380]  It's the first show that comes to mind when you think Gavin.
[33:23.180 --> 33:26.340]  And I don't I don't and I don't remember Andrew ever talking about it.
[33:26.500 --> 33:29.280]  He may have been probably too young for it, because like Eric said,
[33:29.340 --> 33:30.720]  when you and I were too young for it at the time,
[33:30.740 --> 33:33.500]  I definitely heard Andrew talk about friends before, for sure.
[33:33.540 --> 33:36.200]  Is that right? I think so. I think so.
[33:36.280 --> 33:37.820]  Andrew, who's your favorite friends character?
[33:38.380 --> 33:40.820]  I like Ross. Yeah, hell yeah.
[33:41.600 --> 33:44.120]  I mean, you are in a way part of this game. Yeah.
[33:44.340 --> 33:45.900]  Yeah. I mean, think about it, Nick.
[33:46.560 --> 33:48.900]  Everyone's favorite character, Ross.
[33:49.840 --> 33:53.660]  Yeah, Ross. Yeah, everybody.
[33:54.100 --> 33:56.320]  David Schwimmer. Hey, he was good in Band of Brothers.
[33:56.600 --> 33:58.120]  Remember when Padgett Brewster was in it?
[33:58.200 --> 34:00.720]  And that's when Joey and Chandler stopped being friends.
[34:01.560 --> 34:03.140]  And then Chandler had to be inside the box.
[34:03.580 --> 34:06.280]  He's just going to wear you down reciting shit that he's remembering
[34:06.280 --> 34:07.580]  or Googling right now.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.200]  Well, here's the other thing.
[34:09.240 --> 34:12.560]  I'm also worried that it's a TikTok trend that he went through at a certain point.
[34:13.120 --> 34:14.320]  No, that's Mad Men.
[34:15.280 --> 34:17.100]  Well, I know Mad Men pop through it.
[34:17.160 --> 34:20.400]  I also know that Sopranos did as well. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[34:20.580 --> 34:21.720]  No, that's that's the new one.
[34:21.840 --> 34:23.980]  We I will say we haven't watched Friends in a while
[34:23.980 --> 34:26.360]  because Emily's been watching Sopranos so much, but we're past that.
[34:26.420 --> 34:27.080]  Now it's West Wing.
[34:27.940 --> 34:29.180]  Oh, walk and talk, baby.
[34:32.490 --> 34:35.770]  Um, I, Geoff, I don't think it's you.
[34:35.910 --> 34:38.210]  OK, I also don't think it's Geoff.
[34:38.490 --> 34:44.790]  I don't think Gavin would put that unless he was phoning it in.
[34:46.290 --> 34:47.610]  So I'm going to go with Eric.
[34:47.770 --> 34:48.330]  I think it's Eric.
[34:48.430 --> 34:49.070]  Hell yeah, good pick.
[34:49.250 --> 34:51.150]  I think you're making a mistake. Yeah.
[34:52.410 --> 34:54.270]  The only thing I didn't watch was the reunion.
[34:54.430 --> 34:55.970]  I didn't feel like we needed to watch the reunion.
[34:56.210 --> 34:57.050]  Par for the course.
[34:57.630 --> 34:58.410]  All right.
[34:58.450 --> 35:03.050]  The last question before we start revealing these results.
[35:04.170 --> 35:06.870]  A TV show that I hate, Friends.
[35:07.590 --> 35:09.730]  God damn, you're picking me every time.
[35:10.070 --> 35:11.970]  It is me. I can't fucking stand Friends.
[35:12.390 --> 35:14.270]  I've never seen it. I don't like it.
[35:14.270 --> 35:18.970]  Bernie and Gavin and Matt fucking were so up its ass for so long.
[35:19.070 --> 35:20.050]  I'm a Seinfeld guy.
[35:20.170 --> 35:21.950]  I made up everything I said before this.
[35:22.230 --> 35:23.730]  Can't stand that fucking show.
[35:23.830 --> 35:25.990]  Couldn't name you five characters from it.
[35:26.270 --> 35:27.750]  Did know Paul Rudd was in it.
[35:27.830 --> 35:28.910]  Pretended like I didn't earlier.
[35:29.530 --> 35:32.390]  And had nothing positive to say about Friends.
[35:33.390 --> 35:34.470]  And I don't know.
[35:34.570 --> 35:35.670]  Geoff, I'm going to stop you right there.
[35:35.870 --> 35:37.050]  It's you. Yeah, it's me.
[35:37.450 --> 35:40.110]  I'm not I mean, I'm not even going to bother to make an argument.
[35:40.890 --> 35:42.970]  I was going to try to go for something like,
[35:42.970 --> 35:44.350]  oh, no, it's Andrew.
[35:44.550 --> 35:45.730]  You probably it's Andrew.
[35:47.270 --> 35:48.890]  Yeah, we could just get this over with.
[35:49.250 --> 35:51.330]  Yeah, it's absolutely me. I can't fucking stand Friends.
[35:51.390 --> 35:53.090]  It was hard to pretend to like it there for a bit.
[35:53.370 --> 35:54.710]  Emily's not a Friends person.
[35:55.170 --> 35:56.370]  She doesn't watch Friends.
[35:56.410 --> 35:58.290]  All the other TV shows I mentioned, she is.
[35:58.450 --> 36:00.190]  I bet I just threw Friends in there to for.
[36:00.690 --> 36:01.810]  Yeah, well, I like Friends to Veep.
[36:01.890 --> 36:03.030]  That's where I was like, oh, it's not.
[36:03.190 --> 36:04.470]  She doesn't watch Friends in the background.
[36:05.470 --> 36:07.490]  We've gone through all the categories for now.
[36:07.570 --> 36:11.510]  Let's now go through the actual results of this game.
[36:12.110 --> 36:14.570]  The first question was a movie that I love.
[36:14.650 --> 36:15.670]  And I said The Mummy.
[36:16.390 --> 36:19.830]  Nick, you said that that was neither Eric nor Geoff.
[36:19.850 --> 36:21.590]  How do you feel about that at this stage?
[36:22.230 --> 36:23.710]  I'm feeling worse now that you're asking me that.
[36:23.730 --> 36:24.470]  No, I'm just going through.
[36:24.590 --> 36:25.030]  I'm just curious.
[36:25.150 --> 36:27.530]  Now that we've gone through the whole game, do you still hold that opinion?
[36:28.510 --> 36:30.910]  I think I do. I think I do. Honestly.
[36:31.050 --> 36:31.990]  Well, you're correct about that.
[36:32.050 --> 36:34.190]  That was my pick for a movie. Oh, wow. Really?
[36:34.530 --> 36:36.070]  I love The Mummy. I thought it was Gavin.
[36:36.570 --> 36:38.530]  It's such a fun, as you said.
[36:38.530 --> 36:41.250]  I weirdly am not a big Indiana Jones guy,
[36:41.410 --> 36:43.850]  which you'd probably expect as a Mummy fan, as you said, Eric.
[36:44.230 --> 36:45.150]  Kind of adjacent.
[36:45.810 --> 36:50.090]  Benny, is the answer you're looking for, Nick, for the coward across the river.
[36:50.490 --> 36:51.250]  Can't forget Benny.
[36:52.030 --> 36:53.890]  And everybody remembers that. They do.
[36:54.690 --> 36:58.090]  The next one was another movie I love, which is Mission Impossible three.
[36:58.930 --> 36:59.810]  That's Geoff. You said.
[37:00.610 --> 37:04.010]  You said that that was nobody.
[37:04.670 --> 37:05.830]  Cool. As well.
[37:06.290 --> 37:07.030]  Nick. All right.
[37:07.030 --> 37:08.650]  Yeah, it's Geoff.
[37:09.290 --> 37:13.930]  Damn. I explained the entire fucking movie to you in 30 seconds.
[37:14.030 --> 37:15.250]  I gave you the highlights.
[37:15.830 --> 37:17.970]  It's the only thing I've ever heard him remember.
[37:18.650 --> 37:22.110]  Yeah, I think the fact that you didn't say Rabbit's Foot is the thing, though,
[37:22.150 --> 37:23.310]  that I just couldn't remember that part.
[37:23.510 --> 37:24.270]  I couldn't remember that part.
[37:25.210 --> 37:29.990]  One thing. Yeah, when he didn't say Rabbit's Foot, I was like, oh, no.
[37:30.550 --> 37:31.930]  Yeah. Oh, man.
[37:32.670 --> 37:34.690]  Well, it was me. You fucked up.
[37:34.730 --> 37:35.950]  Well, I did fuck up.
[37:35.950 --> 37:41.450]  The next one was a movie I hate, which is Napoleon Dynamite was the thing.
[37:41.550 --> 37:43.730]  You said that it was Eric.
[37:44.850 --> 37:46.310]  You were correct on that.
[37:46.470 --> 37:48.190]  I mean, I'm so stoked.
[37:48.270 --> 37:49.510]  I didn't know you hated that movie, too.
[37:49.550 --> 37:51.090]  This is fucking suck.
[37:51.170 --> 37:52.750]  Yeah, it's a terrible, terrible fuck.
[37:52.790 --> 37:54.950]  I hate that movie so much.
[37:55.030 --> 37:57.090]  It sucks. Shit, stupid.
[37:57.230 --> 37:58.290]  Nothing is not funny.
[37:58.550 --> 37:59.550]  Yep. No. Yep.
[38:00.190 --> 38:04.650]  The next was Armageddon as a movie that I hate.
[38:04.650 --> 38:13.530]  Oh, Nick, you said that that was nobody, I believe.
[38:13.690 --> 38:15.910]  What was your locked in on that one?
[38:15.950 --> 38:19.050]  Oh, at this point, man, it's all just up in the air.
[38:19.810 --> 38:22.550]  Nobody. Thank you for not writing it down, Andrew.
[38:22.650 --> 38:23.250]  This. No, I did.
[38:23.730 --> 38:24.890]  No, I wrote it down. What?
[38:25.290 --> 38:28.670]  I just I was just seeing if he remembered nobody.
[38:29.730 --> 38:30.650]  You were wrong, Nick.
[38:31.030 --> 38:31.910]  It was it was Geoff.
[38:32.270 --> 38:33.310]  It's definitely Geoff.
[38:33.870 --> 38:35.930]  Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
[38:36.230 --> 38:37.310]  That's OK. I was honest with you.
[38:37.310 --> 38:38.130]  I tried to connect to you.
[38:38.210 --> 38:40.530]  I tried to tell you, but like, buddy, you got to pick it.
[38:40.810 --> 38:41.910]  Was it really bad?
[38:42.010 --> 38:43.710]  Like being in the army when that movie came out?
[38:43.750 --> 38:44.510]  Did it fucking suck?
[38:44.990 --> 38:47.190]  Yeah, it fucking just in every way.
[38:47.450 --> 38:48.430]  I hated that film.
[38:48.890 --> 38:51.130]  I was serious. I said I like Deep Impact better.
[38:51.230 --> 38:52.910]  I thought it was a way version of that story.
[38:53.050 --> 38:54.850]  I just fucking it was gross.
[38:55.930 --> 38:56.670]  Deep Impact was better.
[38:57.370 --> 39:01.090]  The next was loved song Madonna.
[39:01.310 --> 39:02.810]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[39:03.010 --> 39:03.970]  You said it was Geoff.
[39:04.870 --> 39:05.530]  I'm going to be wrong.
[39:05.530 --> 39:06.610]  You did. You were correct.
[39:06.730 --> 39:07.970]  It was me. Did he not?
[39:08.690 --> 39:09.170]  Did it what?
[39:09.630 --> 39:10.730]  That's how I have it for scoring.
[39:11.190 --> 39:12.310]  I don't remember him saying that.
[39:12.370 --> 39:13.630]  I remember him saying it was neither of us.
[39:14.310 --> 39:15.170]  Oh, I thought I said it was you.
[39:15.250 --> 39:15.830]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[39:16.350 --> 39:17.470]  Maybe you did. I wrote it down.
[39:17.610 --> 39:18.530]  You did. You wrote it down.
[39:18.570 --> 39:19.510]  Yeah, I said Geoff. That's right.
[39:19.570 --> 39:20.550]  I absolutely said Geoff. OK.
[39:21.370 --> 39:22.730]  Because you were very emphatic about it.
[39:22.730 --> 39:24.190]  I don't know. I'm starting to think that Geoff.
[39:24.470 --> 39:26.610]  I'm starting to think that Nick said me, actually.
[39:27.450 --> 39:29.870]  I'm starting to think that you should shut the fuck up.
[39:30.870 --> 39:32.410]  Nick and Geoff, you get a point.
[39:32.410 --> 39:33.510]  It was Geoff.
[39:34.170 --> 39:35.350]  Thank you, Madonna.
[39:35.830 --> 39:37.210]  Crazy. I had no idea.
[39:37.350 --> 39:37.850]  That's crazy.
[39:38.310 --> 39:38.790]  I love Madonna.
[39:38.990 --> 39:40.590]  I think her first album is so fucking good.
[39:41.150 --> 39:41.630]  I agree.
[39:41.810 --> 39:43.830]  Eric, Eric gave you a run for your money there, though.
[39:43.890 --> 39:44.410]  Holy shit.
[39:44.770 --> 39:46.590]  Oh, yeah, that was a great run by you, Eric.
[39:46.950 --> 39:52.370]  I really like Madonna through like that early that VH1 era of Madonna
[39:52.370 --> 39:53.510]  is fucking brutal.
[39:53.770 --> 39:56.350]  But like she did that Austin Powers song.
[39:56.450 --> 39:58.090]  And it's like that's kind of like the last time
[39:58.090 --> 40:00.530]  you could probably listen to Madonna and be like, this is pretty good.
[40:00.530 --> 40:04.070]  I wouldn't have told beat off stories if I if it wasn't true.
[40:04.730 --> 40:06.110]  Well, now here's the thing.
[40:06.210 --> 40:07.470]  I don't agree with that.
[40:08.070 --> 40:09.870]  I don't think I think that's a lie.
[40:09.930 --> 40:10.690]  Give me a point.
[40:11.010 --> 40:12.050]  That's I think
[40:14.610 --> 40:16.530]  the next was hated song.
[40:17.130 --> 40:18.250]  Hurts so good.
[40:19.470 --> 40:21.130]  Nick, you said that that was Eric.
[40:21.750 --> 40:22.370]  I did.
[40:22.970 --> 40:23.810]  You are incorrect.
[40:24.110 --> 40:26.550]  That is a point for Eric and only Eric.
[40:26.810 --> 40:27.710]  That was mine.
[40:28.030 --> 40:29.830]  I fucking hate Eric at all.
[40:29.830 --> 40:31.210]  No, I like that song.
[40:31.750 --> 40:31.930]  Stand it.
[40:32.150 --> 40:33.370]  Oh, I hate it so much.
[40:33.590 --> 40:35.570]  I think I think that's I think that song is totally fine.
[40:35.670 --> 40:37.550]  I also think that's when he's John Mellencamp.
[40:37.650 --> 40:39.150]  I don't think he's John Cougar at that point.
[40:39.310 --> 40:39.990]  I think he's just John Mellencamp.
[40:40.010 --> 40:41.130]  He rotates around.
[40:41.190 --> 40:44.070]  I just I hate everything about John Mellencamp.
[40:44.230 --> 40:45.030]  Can't stand him.
[40:45.310 --> 40:46.350]  I think he's so cringy.
[40:46.530 --> 40:48.070]  I don't like. Is he Canadian?
[40:48.590 --> 40:49.550]  I don't think so.
[40:49.650 --> 40:50.510]  I think he's from Indiana.
[40:51.130 --> 40:52.050]  Oh yeah, you're right.
[40:52.110 --> 40:53.130]  He is. He's from Indiana.
[40:53.890 --> 40:57.310]  The next one is love TV show Friends.
[40:57.790 --> 40:58.570]  Oh, God.
[40:59.030 --> 41:00.770]  Nick, you picked Eric.
[41:01.490 --> 41:02.190]  I'm wrong.
[41:03.110 --> 41:03.890]  You both get a point.
[41:04.230 --> 41:04.690]  You're correct.
[41:04.850 --> 41:07.090]  Oh, my God.
[41:07.290 --> 41:10.850]  Yeah, I it's it's like, oh, I can list Sopranos and all this stuff.
[41:11.030 --> 41:12.790]  It is in my heart of hearts.
[41:12.790 --> 41:13.550]  I know what it is.
[41:13.990 --> 41:16.050]  And then the last one asked hated show.
[41:16.490 --> 41:18.090]  I appreciate your honesty.
[41:18.150 --> 41:19.830]  He said, Geoff, that
[41:21.530 --> 41:23.290]  Andrew, that's so funny.
[41:23.550 --> 41:24.530]  Back to back.
[41:24.790 --> 41:25.990]  That's such a funny.
[41:25.990 --> 41:27.850]  That's such a funny structure, dude.
[41:28.090 --> 41:28.670]  That's so good.
[41:29.030 --> 41:29.590]  Twice. It's great.
[41:29.790 --> 41:30.810]  It's so funny.
[41:30.870 --> 41:32.150]  I hope you do it to some other people.
[41:35.030 --> 41:35.910]  I want it.
[41:35.990 --> 41:39.010]  Well, you were right, first of all, was Geoff's list of hated show.
[41:39.090 --> 41:43.550]  I thought it was funny that you guys had a show that was your favorite and hated.
[41:43.850 --> 41:45.250]  I thought that was great.
[41:45.590 --> 41:49.470]  I also wanted to, like, create a problem in the strategy
[41:49.470 --> 41:52.910]  you used, Eric, of posting the cassette where that really helps
[41:52.910 --> 41:56.050]  if there's nobody else that lists that they hate it,
[41:56.090 --> 41:58.790]  it then becomes your proof is difficult evidence.
[41:59.010 --> 42:01.010]  Yeah. So to add to total up the game.
[42:01.870 --> 42:05.310]  Nick, you ended up scoring, I believe, five points.
[42:05.950 --> 42:08.390]  Hell yeah. Eric scored three points.
[42:08.810 --> 42:10.410]  Nice. Geoff scored two points.
[42:11.270 --> 42:13.370]  Wow. And two points went to no one.
[42:13.450 --> 42:15.390]  They were wasted. Nice. Great job, fellas. Trash pile.
[42:16.090 --> 42:17.570]  Feels good. Feels good.
[42:17.750 --> 42:18.630]  Trash points.
[42:18.870 --> 42:20.250]  I got to find that friend's cassette again.
[42:20.250 --> 42:23.770]  It has clips from the show where it's like some talking parts and stuff.
[42:23.790 --> 42:24.750]  Like the early seasons.
[42:25.130 --> 42:26.030]  God, that's gross.
[42:26.670 --> 42:28.470]  Yeah. I got to find that again, man.
[42:28.490 --> 42:29.010]  It's pretty good.
[42:29.610 --> 42:31.090]  It's got Hootie and the Blowfish on it.
[42:31.490 --> 42:32.590]  Yeah, but you don't like cassettes.
[42:32.670 --> 42:33.890]  Remember, you went on a whole tour.
[42:34.130 --> 42:35.910]  I definitely don't like cassettes.
[42:36.050 --> 42:37.090]  I got. No, that's what I'm just going to.
[42:37.130 --> 42:38.770]  I'm going to see if I can find it on like Apple Music.
[42:39.270 --> 42:40.550]  I'm not going to buy them.
[42:40.610 --> 42:41.990]  I'm not going to actually get the cassette.
[42:42.130 --> 42:44.310]  It's just the the idea of the music I got to get.
[42:46.330 --> 42:47.050]  Cassettes are terrible.
[42:48.190 --> 42:50.270]  Concludes the first episode of Who Are You?
[42:50.390 --> 42:54.130]  We'll be back with another one with different people, different positions,
[42:54.530 --> 42:55.710]  different questions, potentially.
[42:56.510 --> 42:57.370]  That was a lot of fun.
[42:57.730 --> 42:58.930]  I'm glad we did this.
[42:59.070 --> 43:02.870]  I'm going to like, think about it, maybe adjust a few things for next time.
[43:03.390 --> 43:07.070]  I think when we do it, when there's all five of us, it could be a fun thing
[43:07.070 --> 43:10.070]  where like you could ask the person who's listening on the side.
[43:10.570 --> 43:11.190]  They have an opinion.
[43:11.550 --> 43:12.910]  I don't know. A lot of elements like a phone.
[43:13.010 --> 43:13.610]  Oh, that's it. Yeah.
[43:13.650 --> 43:14.930]  Like a phone a friend type thing.
[43:15.250 --> 43:16.450]  Yeah, I like that.
[43:16.450 --> 43:20.570]  But until then, let let me know how you did in the comments of you
[43:20.570 --> 43:23.650]  guessing who was telling the truth and who was lying and all that,
[43:23.710 --> 43:24.470]  how your score was.
[43:24.570 --> 43:26.230]  I'd be fascinated to know that.
[43:26.690 --> 43:27.790]  Make sure you check out... I nailed it!
[43:27.870 --> 43:29.750]  You did really good, Jit. You did great. For the most part.
