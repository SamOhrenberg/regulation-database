[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  Gentlemen, I am going with supreme pizzas at parties.
[00:06.600 --> 00:12.980]  Follow me on this. Inevitably. I'm not following you anywhere on this, you lunatic. At least 60%
[00:12.980 --> 00:18.580]  of the party goers do not like something on a supreme pizza, whether it be onion or bell pepper
[00:18.580 --> 00:25.640]  or whatever. And as a result, they all hoard the pepperoni, the cheese, the meat lovers.
[00:25.640 --> 00:30.900]  And it's left to us who actually tolerate the okay supreme pizza to have those slices.
[00:31.100 --> 00:36.840]  And then we're out of the stuff we truly want, the meat lovers, the pepperoni, the cheese.
[00:37.060 --> 00:41.780]  And we have to sit there and watch as these people who don't like those things get to enjoy
[00:41.780 --> 00:47.180]  the pizza you actually want. And that is my pet peeve. What'd you have for lunch yesterday, Nick?
[00:47.660 --> 00:49.300]  The leftover supreme pizza. Okay.
