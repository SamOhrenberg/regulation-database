[00:00.000 --> 00:01.160]  Why don't we make better helium?
[00:01.960 --> 00:03.240]  Are we making helium?
[00:03.420 --> 00:05.240]  I don't know anything about helium.
[00:05.680 --> 00:07.720]  I think it's a finite resource, actually.
[00:07.960 --> 00:09.540]  Yes, there's a huge shortage.
[00:09.800 --> 00:11.300]  Wait, there's a helium shortage?
[00:11.660 --> 00:14.520]  Well, we've just used quite a lot of it, and it takes millions of years
[00:14.520 --> 00:15.780]  to get created in the Earth.
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.080]  And it also is so light that it just leaks out of the top of the atmosphere.
[00:20.400 --> 00:23.180]  Well, then why can't I just get my balloons filled at, like,
[00:23.180 --> 00:24.420]  the grocery store with it?
[00:24.440 --> 00:25.840]  Why? What do you mean?
[00:26.280 --> 00:27.520]  It's a rare resource.
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.400]  Well, I mean, it's not like that we're going to run out.
[00:29.400 --> 00:32.460]  It's just as as demand, as it runs low,
[00:32.500 --> 00:35.320]  it'll just get more expensive until eventually no one can afford it.
[00:35.360 --> 00:36.580]  So we can't make helium?
[00:37.260 --> 00:37.460]  No.
[00:38.280 --> 00:39.840]  How? Where does helium come from?
[00:40.780 --> 00:42.020]  Where does anything come from?
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.600]  Well, like the iPhone comes from Apple.
