[00:47.340 --> 00:53.400]  Welcome to Regulation Feud. Very original, very distinct. My own idea.
[00:53.860 --> 01:01.540]  Thank you for joining us. I am your host, Andrew Pantin. As always, joined by Nick Schwartz,
[01:02.120 --> 01:08.360]  Eric Baddour, Jeff Ramsey, Gavin Frey. Hello. You know how I remember the G's in NNA?
[01:08.420 --> 01:11.460]  Because you talked about that before. Eric, you know how I do it? You know what helps me?
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.560]  The anal, the butt waxing video where Jeff had to go first because he was the first G.
[01:17.080 --> 01:20.340]  That's the only way I remember it. I go, God, Jeff had to go first. That's why.
[01:21.940 --> 01:27.160]  Oh, that's irrelevant. We're playing a game. You hear of a thing called Family Feud?
[01:27.440 --> 01:33.080]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But only just recently, you know, just recently. Yeah. Yeah. Like,
[01:33.200 --> 01:37.160]  like two, like three seconds ago, you know, I'm pretty sure it's a TikTok series. I've
[01:37.160 --> 01:43.840]  only seen it there. I think a new thing. This is a game like that, but totally different.
[01:43.940 --> 01:49.560]  This is Regulation Feud. How this is going to work. We're going to break off into teams of two.
[01:50.340 --> 01:55.060]  I'll let you guys make teams right now. Have we ever done teams? I don't think so. Gavin.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.960]  What's up, buddy? Eric, you ready to win this? Eric and Nick. I think it should be up to Andrew
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.160]  what the teams are. Oh, that's I think that sounds like someone who doesn't want to be on
[02:07.160 --> 02:13.880]  a team with Nick. Yeah. What the fuck? You know what? I think we've seen enough G&G. No G&G.
[02:15.000 --> 02:25.700]  Wow. We've seen it. Gavin left. I left for dramatic effect. That's fair.
[02:26.700 --> 02:30.640]  I don't want to be picked last from class. So what teams? What are the teams, Andrew?
[02:31.040 --> 02:35.080]  We're going to go Jeff and Gavin and Eric and Nick as the two teams. Wait.
[02:35.080 --> 02:43.280]  Um, we're just going with it. This is a chaotic game. We're having chaos happen. We're back to
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.160]  G&G. Team one. I'm going to change that. Speaking of chaos, I have no idea what happened for the
[02:49.160 --> 02:54.380]  last 30 seconds or so. I just cut out. I couldn't hear you guys. You're on a team with Gavin after
[02:54.380 --> 02:58.980]  not being on a team with Gavin. You're on a team with Gavin now. So I was on it. I was on a team
[02:58.980 --> 03:02.900]  with Gavin and then I couldn't hear you guys. And now I'm on a team with Gavin again. But there was
[03:02.900 --> 03:07.660]  a period when I wasn't. Yeah, that is correct. When we weren't on the same team, I left. But in
[03:07.660 --> 03:12.320]  doing so, I broke the ability to see Andrew's screen. You did. Because I don't see it either.
[03:12.460 --> 03:19.000]  It's all fucked up. It's just a spinning wheel. Oh, boy. Maybe it's because I'm trying to stream
[03:19.000 --> 03:26.460]  it at Gavinitexture. Maybe it's because you're in the browser. It's working now. I'm using the app
[03:26.460 --> 03:32.560]  and I'm using a stream. I'm in the browser to update. So when I started typing, it went away.
[03:32.680 --> 03:39.220]  So that is not good. Eric, Nick, what is your team called? N-E. Yeah. It's Nick and Eric. So it's
[03:39.220 --> 03:45.340]  like Team GG and then Team N-E. You know what I mean? Team New England. We got it. So how this
[03:45.340 --> 03:51.680]  game is going to work is I made a survey and I sent it out on our Patreon to all of people there.
[03:51.680 --> 03:57.860]  Oh. We asked them a series of questions, some related to the show, some general type questions,
[03:58.160 --> 04:04.920]  and I polled them and your goal is to find the top five for what the questions were. The five
[04:04.920 --> 04:11.440]  most common responses to the questions. I have to think like the audience? You gotta get into the
[04:11.440 --> 04:18.240]  brain of the audience and attempt to figure this out. That's miserable. Terrible. Now,
[04:19.320 --> 04:25.420]  five is the the most common answer, and that is worth five points. Four is worth four points. Three
[04:25.420 --> 04:31.480]  is worth three. Two is two. One is one. So the number one answer is the worst answer. Yeah.
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.260]  Number one is worth one point, so it's the worst answer. Number five is the most points,
[04:36.320 --> 04:41.880]  so it's the best answer. You get the most points for the most. Got it. But before we do that,
[04:41.880 --> 04:49.120]  we have to decide who is going to play or who is going to pass. So team GG and team any pick
[04:49.120 --> 04:55.500]  somebody pick one of you each. You're up, Jeff. OK, I'm up. Sure. Why not? All right. There we go.
[04:55.660 --> 05:00.180]  All right. Question one. Now I'm going to ask this question and it's a number.
[05:01.580 --> 05:05.360]  And then you guys are going to say I'm going to I'm going to do a countdown. And when I say go,
[05:05.400 --> 05:11.460]  you'll both say your number. Oh, boy. Whoever is closest to the answer will get to decide
[05:11.460 --> 05:16.260]  if they want to try to answer the question first, the first game, or if they want the other side to
[05:16.260 --> 05:22.300]  pass it or play and then give them the opportunity to steal. So Nick and I are just blurting out the
[05:22.300 --> 05:26.620]  answer as quick as possible. Oh, God, I'm going to know I'm going to I'm going to read it out the
[05:26.620 --> 05:31.120]  question and I'm going to do a countdown and I'm going to say go. And once I say go, you guys both
[05:31.120 --> 05:39.360]  say a number and whoever's closest. What if we say the same number? Then I'll ask a different
[05:39.360 --> 05:44.720]  question. Why not just buzz in with different soundboard sounds? Because that would require a
[05:44.720 --> 05:50.500]  lot more work from Nick. Yeah. Unless you want to do that, Gavin. Buzz, you want to be the buzz board
[05:50.500 --> 05:53.600]  guy? Like I have a feeling that one won't make it in. Yeah, it's going to be really funny when we're
[05:53.600 --> 06:04.160]  laughing at nothing. Question one. How many pillows form Pillow Mountain? It's a great peak.
[06:04.160 --> 06:13.200]  It's a great mountain. Oh, my God. This is a recent count I did. Three, two, one, go. Eleven.
[06:15.680 --> 06:22.620]  Jeff said eight. Yeah. Nick said eleven. Yeah. The answer. How many pillows form Pillow Mountain?
[06:23.040 --> 06:28.700]  It's going to be eight. Seventeen! What? Oh, closer! Seventeen pillows form Pillow Mountain.
[06:29.040 --> 06:33.240]  I Nick, I don't know what I'm talking about. Great guess. That's an insane
[06:33.720 --> 06:40.300]  guess. What the fuck? Hold on a second, Andrew. Are you implying that you have a bed that holds
[06:41.260 --> 06:47.740]  seventeen pillows? Barely, yes. They fall off the side. They slide. Listen, the mountain crashes all
[06:47.740 --> 06:53.140]  the time. Oh, boy. But there are seventeen pillows that form Pillow Mountain. It used to be seven,
[06:53.220 --> 06:57.660]  didn't it? It used to be eight. Yeah, I remember it being eight. I bought five pillows at Christmas
[06:57.660 --> 07:02.980]  and then I think I've maybe pillaged some pillows from other places in the house.
[07:03.500 --> 07:10.300]  Pillaged. Pillow, pillow. You bought five pillows at Christmas? I wanted to upgrade my sleep game,
[07:10.380 --> 07:14.740]  so I bought a bunch of pillows and I made a right choice. They're king size pillows. They're
[07:14.740 --> 07:20.860]  massive. Dear God. It's really it's caused some falling. Seventeen pillows. The bed also slides
[07:20.860 --> 07:25.020]  away from the walls and the pillows fall down the hole. So I just keep clogging the hole with pillow.
[07:25.160 --> 07:31.860]  It's a whole thing. Anyway, because you won, Nick and Eric, you have to decide. Do you want to play
[07:31.860 --> 07:36.820]  or do you want to pass? Now, if you play. Yeah. You have three strikes to fill the board. If you
[07:36.820 --> 07:44.340]  don't fill the board within three strikes, then team GG will get to try to steal it,
[07:44.840 --> 07:48.540]  meaning they will have one chance to say one of the answers you missed.
[07:48.760 --> 07:54.700]  OK, but if they miss that, then you still get the points. OK, would you like to play or pass?
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.600]  What is the best Jackie Chan movie? Nick, what do you think? I think we should play. I think we
[07:58.600 --> 08:04.740]  should play. Let's take the strike while the striking is good. OK. They're playing. Now,
[08:04.840 --> 08:11.060]  remember, Nick, Nick, it's crucial. This isn't what we this is not what we think is the best
[08:11.060 --> 08:16.080]  Jackie Chan. Absolutely. Yeah. Like like I don't think that something like Supercop is going to
[08:16.080 --> 08:23.680]  make the list. No. We have to get in the mind of the listeners of this podcast, the comment leavers,
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.160]  the regulation. You got to get in there. The tuxedo is on their thoughts. Yeah. Oh, yeah,
[08:28.180 --> 08:32.620]  absolutely. OK, so we're going to go back and forth or what are we doing? We just we're. Yeah,
[08:32.620 --> 08:38.660]  I will. I will start with you, Eric. Eric, what is the best Jackie Chan movie? OK, I think that
[08:38.660 --> 08:48.800]  what they're going to put as boy, the best Jackie Chan movie is going to be Rush Hour. Yeah. Rush
[08:48.800 --> 08:55.200]  hour. That'll be clear. You mean the first rush hour? Not not rush hour. Oh, wow. OK, so the other
[08:55.200 --> 08:58.900]  rush hours could potentially be on the list as good. Any anything could be on the list. I would
[08:58.900 --> 09:03.700]  say rush hour one. I would say the first rush hour. Yes. Rush hour. First rush hour. First
[09:03.700 --> 09:12.400]  rush hour is on the list. Yeah. And it's our top answer. Wow. Yeah. I personally found surprising.
[09:12.420 --> 09:17.080]  I also find that that's nuts. Yeah. As the best Jackie Chan movie. I think that's kind of crazy.
[09:17.080 --> 09:22.060]  Again, I agree. Gavin, you have to consider this isn't actually the best Jackie Chan movie. It's
[09:22.060 --> 09:27.420]  the Jackie Chan movies that the people who listen to this podcast have seen. Yeah. Which is still
[09:27.420 --> 09:32.980]  nuts. Yeah. Yeah. I still think that I still think that's high, personally. But some of the older
[09:32.980 --> 09:38.860]  stuff that's, you know, foreign language isn't difficult to find. No, no, no. I agree. I absolutely
[09:38.860 --> 09:43.600]  agree with you. Not for you. Not hard. But here we are. But maybe this after this category, you'll
[09:43.600 --> 09:50.740]  have a better barometer of what the audience is thinking. Oh, OK. Nick, what do you think? I'm
[09:50.740 --> 09:56.320]  going to stick to a movie on the the same chain here. We're going rush hour to rush hour to rush
[09:56.320 --> 10:07.720]  hour to is on the list. The second most popular answer. I do enjoy personally. Yeah, I think
[10:07.720 --> 10:12.880]  two is better than rush hour. Why? That's what I thought at the time. So I'm surprised that so
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.740]  many people preferred the original. Now, this could be a factor you need to figure is that these are
[10:18.740 --> 10:25.000]  manually inserted. So there's probably a percentage of people that put rush hour in thinking they were
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.660]  saying rush hour to. I agree. Now, Nick, do we try to go? Do we go for rush hour three and do the
[10:30.660 --> 10:35.240]  clean sweep or do we change it up? I think we change it up. You think so? OK. I think one of
[10:35.240 --> 10:39.540]  the Shanghai's. It's it's the. Yeah, but here's the thing. It's the listeners of this podcast. So
[10:39.540 --> 10:45.100]  I got to I got to I got to say I got to say the tuxedo. Yeah, absolutely. Eric's going with the
[10:45.100 --> 10:50.360]  tuxedo as one of the best Jackie Chan movies of all time. It's the lowest one film that Gavin
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.960]  described as his biggest disappointment of his childhood. Yeah. Standby is the third best Jackie
[10:56.960 --> 11:04.020]  Chan movie. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're crushing it. Holy shit. In his top three. Guys are killing it,
[11:04.080 --> 11:11.700]  going in order. Mm hmm. Currently have 11 points on the board. Oh, 12 points. Nick.
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.920]  Back at you. You don't think that they would have done the new karate kid, do you?
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.240]  I don't think so. I don't think because that's not I don't think that's a thing you think of
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.240]  when you think of Jackie Chan off the off the rip. So which of the Shanghai's are we doing then?
[11:27.420 --> 11:34.360]  Noon or nights? Noon is more memorable because I forgot that Shanghai Nights was a movie. Okay,
[11:34.480 --> 11:41.860]  perfect. Shanghai Noon. Shanghai Noon is the official guess. Yes. They keep their streak
[11:41.860 --> 11:51.080]  going. Shanghai Noon is Gavin the fourth most responded answer. Gavin, we might be in trouble.
[11:51.720 --> 11:56.320]  Gavin. Oh yeah. Gavin, is there a world right now where you think that this hasn't
[11:56.320 --> 12:01.560]  happened and he's just listing the things that we're saying in order? That would be so funny.
[12:06.120 --> 12:11.060]  I think what he's actually doing is gathering data so the community can play Family Feud.
[12:11.260 --> 12:18.040]  I agree. Now, Nick, Nick, we have to think is Shanghai Nights one that people remember or
[12:18.040 --> 12:26.700]  do we go Kung Fu Panda? Or, boy, do we do Rush Hour 3? Because it feels like it might be on there.
[12:26.700 --> 12:31.400]  Do you consider Kung Fu Panda to be a Jackie Chan movie? I don't. I would consider it to
[12:31.400 --> 12:35.040]  be a Jack Black movie. You know what? But he's in it. Hey, of course he's in it,
[12:35.080 --> 12:38.460]  but I just don't know that people would... I don't know that it's synonymous with him.
[12:38.740 --> 12:42.860]  Like, I also don't consider it to be an Angelina Jolie movie. No, that's fair. I understand what
[12:42.860 --> 12:47.360]  you're saying. I'd say technically. Roll Rush Hour 3. Okay, let's do it. Let's try Rush Hour 3,
[12:47.360 --> 12:55.560]  Andrew. Rush Hour 3 is their guess. Rush Hour 3 is wrong. Your first strike. Swing and a miss.
[12:55.900 --> 13:00.640]  People had enough Rush Hour after Rush Hour 2. Yeah, I agree with that. So they're gonna make
[13:00.640 --> 13:04.800]  a fourth one. We all laughed at the guy who would not be in Rush Hour 3. Turns out he's the
[13:04.800 --> 13:10.100]  one laughing. Didn't want to be. Didn't need to be. First strike, two more strikes. What is your
[13:10.100 --> 13:15.880]  next guess? What do you think, Nick? Maybe we do swing with the Kung Fu Panda then. Do you want to
[13:15.880 --> 13:20.540]  try? You want to try Kung Fu Panda? Yeah, let's do it. Kung Fu Panda. Okay, going with a younger
[13:20.540 --> 13:25.460]  audience vote. Recently, there was the fourth film in the franchise, making it very relevant,
[13:25.880 --> 13:32.360]  but not to our audience. Kung Fu Panda is a miss. Your two strikes. You got one left to
[13:32.360 --> 13:40.080]  lock in this category. What is the best Jackie Chan movie? This is a tough one. What's another?
[13:40.420 --> 13:44.200]  You don't think they're thinking Operation Condor, do you? You're gonna blow it.
[13:45.060 --> 13:52.800]  Do you think we go with Shanghai Knights? Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. Shanghai Knights,
[13:52.820 --> 13:57.600]  let's give it a try. I think that's crazy. I think Shanghai being on this list is nuts.
[13:57.920 --> 14:03.040]  So let's try Shanghai Knights. I like Shanghai, dude, but just throw it out. Just the absurdity
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.080]  of declaring that Shanghai Knights is one of Jackie Chan's top five films. You're out with
[14:08.080 --> 14:15.960]  three strikes. It is not there. OK, Jeff and Gavin team GG have a chance to steal the category.
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.340]  Jeff and Gavin, what are you thinking? So, Jeff, do you think we should go foreign
[14:19.340 --> 14:24.420]  or do you think we should? I think you need to get into the mind of our audience.
[14:24.860 --> 14:29.440]  I'm immediately thinking it's going to be like Police Story or Who Am I? Because Who Am I has
[14:29.440 --> 14:33.740]  been on... Who Am I is a big one or I'd like for... I immediately go to Rumble in the Bronx,
[14:33.840 --> 14:37.040]  but that might be my bias because it's the first one I saw.
[14:39.420 --> 14:41.760]  Oh, I also don't think Karate Kid's a bad choice.
[14:46.270 --> 14:52.270]  There's like three police stories. You're the Jackie Chan guy, so I'm going to let you make
[14:52.270 --> 14:56.170]  the choice. I'll support whatever you think, but I don't think it's going to be one of his
[14:56.170 --> 15:01.510]  foreign films like Drunken Master or any of that personally. But I trust you.
[15:02.590 --> 15:09.170]  I mean, I would go... I'm drawn to Who Am I because it was often quoted on Achievement
[15:09.170 --> 15:11.970]  Hunter videos, but I don't know if necessarily people remember that.
[15:12.490 --> 15:14.790]  Well, it's only for one point, you know? Yeah.
[15:16.010 --> 15:18.590]  Go with your gut. It is the least
[15:19.090 --> 15:23.390]  responded of the top five. So it is the least popular of the top five.
[15:24.790 --> 15:27.730]  The least popular, popular... What other American shite was he in?
[15:28.270 --> 15:30.770]  He was in Shanghai Noon. He was in Shanghai Nights.
[15:31.330 --> 15:32.750]  He was in Rush Hour 1. He was in Rush Hour 2.
[15:32.750 --> 15:35.530]  He was in the tuxedo. He was in Rush Hour 1. He was in Rush Hour 2.
[15:37.550 --> 15:40.770]  I like your Who Am I question. All right, should we go with it?
[15:40.950 --> 15:43.190]  It's probably wrong, but it's probably a police story.
[15:43.590 --> 15:45.910]  Your answer is Who Am I? Yeah.
[15:46.650 --> 15:53.470]  The answer was said. It came out of somebody's mouth, but it wasn't Who Am I.
[15:54.170 --> 15:55.670]  Shit. Team N.E.
[15:55.770 --> 16:01.870]  win the category, getting 14 points. The least answered top five.
[16:02.170 --> 16:04.290]  Jeff, you said it. Drunken Master.
[16:04.290 --> 16:06.950]  Drunken Master. Damn.
[16:07.110 --> 16:10.570]  In the very bottom. Kudos to the audience.
[16:10.870 --> 16:12.490]  Hell yeah. Yeah, really, I didn't.
[16:12.610 --> 16:17.730]  I would not have put that on them. Like, wow, okay, cool.
[16:17.870 --> 16:20.670]  Newfound respect gained. Yeah, way to go.
[16:20.890 --> 16:25.090]  Also, definitely not one of his five best movies.
[16:25.430 --> 16:31.550]  No. Like, fun, not one of his five best movies.
[16:32.230 --> 16:36.650]  Let's move on to the next decider. Oh, boy.
[16:37.950 --> 16:40.350]  What is Condor Man's Rotten Tomatoes score?
[16:40.910 --> 16:43.810]  Once again, if both teams want to pick a representative to guess this one.
[16:43.990 --> 16:45.130]  You should go. I'll do it this time, Nick.
[16:46.090 --> 16:47.330]  Yeah. Your turn, Gav.
[16:47.690 --> 16:51.050]  Okay. Well, the question is,
[16:51.550 --> 16:54.830]  what is Condor Man's Rotten Tomatoes score? I'm going to count down.
[16:55.270 --> 16:58.170]  Three, two, one, go.
[17:00.350 --> 17:00.830]  Fourteen. Forty-four.
[17:01.310 --> 17:02.470]  Thirteen, forty-four.
[17:04.910 --> 17:07.590]  Oh, it's close. I think there's a lot of...
[17:07.590 --> 17:09.550]  You two are both close. I think there's like a lot of nostalgia.
[17:11.310 --> 17:16.930]  However, this is going to G&G. It is 27.
[17:17.390 --> 17:20.330]  Wow, that is so much lower than I thought.
[17:20.770 --> 17:21.450]  Yeah. Wow.
[17:21.730 --> 17:25.910]  The question in the next game is, what is the best Apple team, Gigi?
[17:26.570 --> 17:29.630]  Do you want to play or pass?
[17:30.230 --> 17:32.550]  I mean, I think we want to play, right?
[17:32.790 --> 17:33.830]  Yeah. Do you want to play?
[17:33.830 --> 17:35.330]  You guys could pass, though, if you want to.
[17:35.990 --> 17:37.890]  Like, don't think too hard about it.
[17:38.030 --> 17:39.550]  Yeah, you guys can hand it off. It's okay.
[17:40.370 --> 17:41.770]  It's totally fine. We'll take it.
[17:42.070 --> 17:43.090]  Sounds like they want to play.
[17:43.830 --> 17:46.530]  I'll just go first, if you want? Or who goes first?
[17:46.670 --> 17:48.870]  Go ahead. What is the best Apple? Go ahead, Jeff.
[17:49.070 --> 17:50.250]  I'm going to pick Cosmic Crisp.
[17:50.950 --> 17:52.790]  What? Cosmic Crisp is your guess.
[17:52.950 --> 17:53.470]  Bad answer.
[17:54.030 --> 17:59.510]  It's a great Apple, great people, fans of the show, supporters of us.
[17:59.790 --> 18:01.330]  So it should come to a little surprise.
[18:01.590 --> 18:03.670]  Cosmic Crisp is the number one Apple.
[18:03.850 --> 18:04.370]  Hell yeah.
[18:05.070 --> 18:07.570]  One polled by the audience.
[18:08.790 --> 18:10.550]  Gavin, you're a big Apple lover.
[18:10.670 --> 18:14.530]  What is the second best Apple, according to our audience?
[18:14.550 --> 18:16.050]  Or just the second opinion?
[18:16.930 --> 18:20.190]  I think it's probably going to be Cosmic Adjacent, surely.
[18:20.970 --> 18:22.390]  What do you reckon, like a pink lady, Jeff?
[18:22.770 --> 18:24.910]  I think a pink lady is a great choice.
[18:25.130 --> 18:30.650]  I think a Honeycrisp, Red Delicious is a possibility.
[18:30.670 --> 18:31.710]  Should we go with Honeycrisp?
[18:31.750 --> 18:32.890]  Let's go with Honeycrisp.
[18:32.890 --> 18:33.110]  OK.
[18:34.350 --> 18:36.110]  Honeycrisp is their official guest.
[18:37.070 --> 18:37.430]  Guest.
[18:37.610 --> 18:38.870]  Not guest. I don't know why I say guest.
[18:39.210 --> 18:40.450]  Don't make fun of the host.
[18:40.450 --> 18:40.830]  I'm juggling.
[18:41.150 --> 18:42.890]  I think they should lose points for making fun of the host.
[18:43.470 --> 18:45.310]  No, that was a fair mistake.
[18:45.490 --> 18:46.910]  Yeah, they should be down in the negative.
[18:46.910 --> 18:52.150]  You have five hypothetical points, but now you've got seven hypothetical points.
[18:52.950 --> 18:55.430]  Honeycrisp, the number two point answer.
[18:55.690 --> 18:57.070]  It's way lower than I thought.
[18:57.090 --> 18:57.370]  On the board.
[18:58.130 --> 18:59.150]  That's like my number two apple.
[18:59.390 --> 19:02.210]  Leaving you with the one, three and four point left.
[19:02.810 --> 19:04.130]  Jeff, what is the best apple?
[19:04.690 --> 19:05.850]  Oh, Gav, what do you think?
[19:05.930 --> 19:06.270]  Should I go?
[19:06.390 --> 19:08.130]  Do you think Macintosh is going to get picked?
[19:08.850 --> 19:09.410]  Oh, shit.
[19:09.910 --> 19:13.670]  I mean, do you think that would be picked before pink ladies and Granny Smiths?
[19:13.850 --> 19:15.650]  Maybe Granny Smith would be low because it's green.
[19:15.970 --> 19:16.310]  Yeah.
[19:16.730 --> 19:17.570]  How about Red Delicious?
[19:17.750 --> 19:18.630]  People eat that a lot, right?
[19:18.670 --> 19:19.030]  Or Gala?
[19:20.030 --> 19:20.990]  Yeah, do a Red Delish.
[19:20.990 --> 19:21.730]  Red Delish.
[19:22.650 --> 19:23.010]  Shh.
[19:24.790 --> 19:25.750]  Take your hand off the piece.
[19:25.790 --> 19:26.490]  Take your hand off the piece.
[19:26.550 --> 19:27.130]  Take your hand off the piece.
[19:27.210 --> 19:27.810]  Take your hand off the piece.
[19:28.610 --> 19:29.650]  Take it on Pink Lady.
[19:30.470 --> 19:30.830]  Oh!
[19:31.110 --> 19:31.470]  Ooh.
[19:31.850 --> 19:32.170]  Ooh!
[19:33.390 --> 19:34.910]  He took his hand.
[19:35.070 --> 19:37.830]  He had the Red Delicious piece in his fingers.
[19:38.050 --> 19:38.650]  I couldn't do it.
[19:38.730 --> 19:39.570]  He was about to play it.
[19:39.810 --> 19:41.790]  He swapped it out for Pink Lady.
[19:42.410 --> 19:43.510]  Is Pink Lady on the board?
[19:44.390 --> 19:45.450]  She sure is!
[19:45.510 --> 19:48.050]  With the three point answer.
[19:48.370 --> 19:48.490]  Oh, damn.
[19:48.670 --> 19:49.670]  So what's number four?
[19:49.770 --> 19:50.770]  Pink Lady.
[19:50.950 --> 19:51.670]  I know what it is.
[19:51.690 --> 19:52.230]  Coming in.
[19:53.370 --> 19:54.590]  I think I know too, Nick.
[19:54.750 --> 19:55.590]  You guys currently have ten points.
[19:55.730 --> 19:56.910]  When it comes to us, we got it.
[19:56.930 --> 19:59.270]  With two left to find the fourth and the one point.
[19:59.670 --> 20:00.930]  Watch him swinging a Missy.
[20:00.950 --> 20:01.670]  Gavin, what's the best app?
[20:01.810 --> 20:02.250]  This one over.
[20:02.630 --> 20:03.150]  Here we go.
[20:03.930 --> 20:05.750]  You reckon we should go Red Delish next?
[20:06.730 --> 20:07.110]  Yeah.
[20:08.430 --> 20:08.850]  Yeah.
[20:10.570 --> 20:11.410]  Red Delicious.
[20:12.810 --> 20:17.910]  Red Delicious, after being nearly played last time, is being played this time.
[20:18.170 --> 20:21.470]  Which is a foolish move because Red Delicious is not on the board!
[20:21.470 --> 20:22.670]  You're not on the list!
[20:23.150 --> 20:23.810]  You fool!
[20:24.010 --> 20:25.370]  Your first strike.
[20:27.610 --> 20:29.450]  Okay, that'll be our only strike.
[20:29.850 --> 20:30.110]  Okay.
[20:30.590 --> 20:31.690]  Gavin claiming only strike.
[20:31.790 --> 20:32.430]  Back to Jeff.
[20:32.830 --> 20:33.730]  I'm going to go with Fuji.
[20:35.090 --> 20:35.690]  Fuji.
[20:37.310 --> 20:38.510]  Interesting pick.
[20:40.850 --> 20:43.930]  Fuji is on the board.
[20:44.090 --> 20:47.070]  As the least popular.
[20:47.270 --> 20:47.990]  It's the one point.
[20:48.470 --> 20:52.910]  Leaving you with one left.
[20:53.170 --> 20:54.310]  The four point answer.
[20:54.610 --> 20:54.710]  Jesus Christ.
[20:55.290 --> 20:56.810]  You have two strikes remaining.
[20:57.330 --> 20:59.970]  I would have gone Granny Smith if the number one was left.
[21:00.070 --> 21:02.030]  But I don't think Granny Smith will be number four.
[21:03.410 --> 21:03.890]  Surely.
[21:04.250 --> 21:04.790]  Guess it anyway.
[21:05.270 --> 21:06.850]  It's name recognition though, you know?
[21:06.990 --> 21:07.210]  Yeah.
[21:07.390 --> 21:08.110]  It's a famous apple.
[21:08.830 --> 21:10.830]  And for a lot of people, their favorite apple.
[21:12.070 --> 21:13.130]  What are you guessing?
[21:13.510 --> 21:14.550]  What is the best apple?
[21:17.410 --> 21:18.690]  I've got an apple blank.
[21:19.670 --> 21:20.830]  You can talk about it with Jeff.
[21:21.110 --> 21:22.330]  Nick, Nick, think on it, think on it.
[21:22.490 --> 21:22.970]  Oh, I got it, baby.
[21:22.970 --> 21:23.450]  They're lost.
[21:23.590 --> 21:23.910]  I know.
[21:24.610 --> 21:26.230]  So we had Gala, we had Granny Smith.
[21:26.490 --> 21:27.210]  What else did we have, Jeff?
[21:28.570 --> 21:29.630]  Granny Smith, Gala.
[21:29.990 --> 21:32.850]  We also had Macintosh, we said.
[21:34.550 --> 21:36.990]  And I think that's it.
[21:37.030 --> 21:38.110]  I think that's all that we've said.
[21:39.050 --> 21:41.630]  All right, should we just do Gala and Granny Smith?
[21:42.050 --> 21:42.290]  Yeah.
[21:43.790 --> 21:44.370]  Granny Smith!
[21:44.370 --> 21:44.770]  Granny Smith.
[21:46.270 --> 21:47.750]  Gavin guesses Granny Smith.
[21:48.850 --> 21:51.250]  Granny Smith is the number four answer!
[21:51.530 --> 21:53.910]  You guys cleared the category!
[21:54.610 --> 21:55.130]  Way to go.
[21:55.390 --> 21:56.430]  Wow, good work.
[21:56.750 --> 21:57.530]  Great job.
[21:57.890 --> 21:58.410]  Nick, Nick, Nick.
[21:58.410 --> 22:00.470]  GG, taking the lead 15 points to 14.
[22:00.470 --> 22:03.470]  Nick, you have to consider, Nick, you have to think of the audience, man.
[22:03.510 --> 22:06.030]  You can't think about what apples are actually good.
[22:06.110 --> 22:08.610]  You can't, you can't let it get to you, dude.
[22:08.850 --> 22:11.050]  Not compared to a Pink Lady or a Honeycrisp.
[22:11.150 --> 22:11.870]  Yep, absolutely.
[22:12.070 --> 22:13.050]  You cannot, you can't.
[22:13.070 --> 22:13.490]  They're golden delicious.
[22:14.010 --> 22:16.930]  You can't get in that, Nick, you can't think of it factually.
[22:17.050 --> 22:19.910]  You have to think of it like, like, like a zany audience member.
[22:20.330 --> 22:24.130]  But you just have to say the first thing that comes to your fucking little brain.
[22:24.310 --> 22:26.410]  Right, it's named after an old lady.
[22:26.770 --> 22:27.690]  It's gonna taste ancient.
[22:28.050 --> 22:29.750]  There's nothing zany about Granny Smith.
[22:29.950 --> 22:30.950]  Solid choice.
[22:31.210 --> 22:32.090]  Solid apple.
[22:32.850 --> 22:35.250]  Premium placement in the grocery store for a reason.
[22:35.590 --> 22:36.970]  An excellent sheen as well.
[22:37.710 --> 22:39.530]  Yeah, when you got caramel on it, sure.
[22:40.410 --> 22:41.290]  That's a good point.
[22:41.370 --> 22:41.950]  It's great with caramel.
[22:41.950 --> 22:43.890]  Tell him, Nick, tell him, Nick.
[22:43.910 --> 22:44.670]  Yeah, fuck him up, fuck him up.
[22:44.670 --> 22:46.050]  To the next decider.
[22:46.510 --> 22:47.490]  Okay, Nick, this could be you.
[22:47.490 --> 22:49.550]  What percentage are my ankles today?
[22:49.990 --> 22:50.770]  All right, Nick, lock it in.
[22:50.830 --> 22:51.410]  What do you think?
[22:51.450 --> 22:52.890]  You think about the numbers?
[22:52.990 --> 22:53.930]  Think about what he's been up to?
[22:54.110 --> 22:54.890]  Okay, all right.
[22:55.150 --> 22:58.670]  Think about, think about why we were late to this recording.
[22:59.410 --> 23:00.050]  Geoff, you gonna do it?
[23:00.410 --> 23:01.030]  Yeah, I got it.
[23:01.350 --> 23:02.590]  All right, Geoff's gonna do it.
[23:02.690 --> 23:04.150]  Okay, Nick versus Geoff.
[23:04.330 --> 23:04.670]  Here we go.
[23:04.750 --> 23:08.210]  Three, two, one, go.
[23:08.290 --> 23:08.650]  45.
[23:08.730 --> 23:09.050]  86.
[23:10.650 --> 23:12.510]  Oh, that's insanely high.
[23:12.510 --> 23:13.250]  Nick said 45.
[23:14.150 --> 23:15.450]  Geoff said 86.
[23:18.030 --> 23:19.150]  The answer...
[23:19.150 --> 23:19.890]  99%!
[23:20.090 --> 23:20.530]  They're great.
[23:20.750 --> 23:21.970]  Not even 99.99.
[23:22.470 --> 23:23.390]  I knew it!
[23:23.790 --> 23:26.150]  He hasn't complained about his ankles in forever.
[23:26.450 --> 23:27.550]  That's such a good point.
[23:28.130 --> 23:31.750]  Gotta leave room for them to be somehow better, but no issues.
[23:32.110 --> 23:32.970]  Zero complaints.
[23:33.130 --> 23:34.710]  Which leads us to the next category.
[23:35.130 --> 23:36.590]  What's the best flavor of ice cream?
[23:36.810 --> 23:37.310]  Oh, shit.
[23:37.310 --> 23:38.030]  Oh, fuck.
[23:38.030 --> 23:40.610]  Flavors can get ridiculous because of those.
[23:40.750 --> 23:41.370]  Yeah, fuck.
[23:41.850 --> 23:42.770]  They get complicated.
[23:43.230 --> 23:43.510]  Yeah.

[24:40.790 --> 24:42.710]  I know what the top one is.
[24:43.310 --> 24:43.670]  Okay.
[24:44.090 --> 24:44.410]  Okay.
[24:44.810 --> 24:45.090]  Okay.
[24:45.350 --> 24:47.130]  But it doesn't help us right here because...
[24:47.130 --> 24:50.130]  No, but that's why we wait on it because they're going to blow it and we'll take it.
[24:50.270 --> 24:52.770]  I feel like people who pass are such idiots.
[24:53.030 --> 24:55.050]  They're just removing their own screen time.
[24:55.250 --> 24:56.930]  But I don't know if we could get all five.
[24:57.470 --> 24:57.870]  I agree.
[24:58.090 --> 24:59.090]  I think we should pass.
[24:59.670 --> 25:00.010]  Wow.
[25:01.610 --> 25:04.890]  I think it's just, I think it's, I just think it's, it's...
[25:04.890 --> 25:06.010]  Yeah, I would rather pass.
[25:06.310 --> 25:07.410]  Let's sweep it with a steal.
[25:07.770 --> 25:08.550]  Yeah, let's, we'll steal.
[25:09.090 --> 25:09.350]  Okay.
[25:09.630 --> 25:09.990]  Okay.
[25:11.530 --> 25:12.610]  Okay, they're passing.
[25:12.830 --> 25:14.050]  I love that you said that, Gavin.
[25:14.110 --> 25:14.850]  I'm right there with you.
[25:15.030 --> 25:16.050]  Nick, you want to take this first one?
[25:16.210 --> 25:17.130]  Absolutely, I do.
[25:17.350 --> 25:19.390]  And that is going to be cookie dough.
[25:20.370 --> 25:21.090]  Yeah, absolutely.
[25:21.230 --> 25:21.750]  Cookie dough?
[25:22.050 --> 25:22.330]  Yep.
[25:22.570 --> 25:24.030]  You said that with a lot of confidence.
[25:24.670 --> 25:28.410]  Where do you think it ranks if you're going to guess on this board if it were there?
[25:28.810 --> 25:29.730]  Four or five.
[25:30.250 --> 25:31.490]  Oh, really? I think it's top three.
[25:32.430 --> 25:33.090]  Top three?
[25:33.170 --> 25:34.250]  You guys both think it's top three?
[25:34.250 --> 25:36.210]  Cookie dough is on the board.
[25:36.630 --> 25:38.150]  It's the two-point answer.
[25:38.270 --> 25:39.070]  Oh, there you go.
[25:39.090 --> 25:39.490]  Okay.
[25:39.690 --> 25:40.150]  I wasn't expecting, okay.
[25:40.350 --> 25:41.710]  Barely squeaking in.
[25:44.390 --> 25:46.230]  What is your next guest?
[25:47.250 --> 25:48.550]  I keep saying guest.
[25:48.690 --> 25:50.650]  Why am I fucking, why am I throwing a T on that?
[25:50.930 --> 25:51.830]  Best guess.
[25:52.410 --> 25:52.690]  Jesus.
[25:53.550 --> 25:56.470]  I'm, you got to get in the mind of the audience.
[25:56.710 --> 25:56.930]  Yep.
[25:57.230 --> 26:01.530]  And I think what they're going for is vanilla.
[26:01.990 --> 26:02.870]  Oh, interesting.
[26:03.590 --> 26:03.930]  Yeah.
[26:04.430 --> 26:04.770]  That's good.
[26:04.930 --> 26:07.210]  How do you feel about the vanilla pick, Gavin and Jeff?
[26:07.710 --> 26:10.380]  I would have picked it, but it's not something I would eat.
[26:12.750 --> 26:14.870]  I think it's, I think you're going to be surprised.
[26:15.730 --> 26:16.530]  I don't know.
[26:16.610 --> 26:17.230]  What is that? Okay.
[26:17.250 --> 26:18.170]  So what does that mean?
[26:18.410 --> 26:19.470]  I don't know that it's on there.
[26:19.550 --> 26:21.270]  I don't know that vanilla is going to show up.
[26:21.370 --> 26:25.310]  I think it'll be either the number five point or it'll be not on there at all.
[26:26.230 --> 26:29.590]  Gavin has great ice cream senses because it is the number five answer.
[26:30.070 --> 26:30.530]  Yeah, absolutely.
[26:30.530 --> 26:34.030]  It's number five, which means it's the number one answer.
[26:34.190 --> 26:35.310]  I don't understand.
[26:36.230 --> 26:37.490]  Okay. Sure. Sure.
[26:38.050 --> 26:38.250]  Okay.
[26:38.330 --> 26:40.370]  You have to think of the, it's plain.
[26:40.670 --> 26:42.390]  You have to think of the audience.
[26:42.490 --> 26:44.570]  You can't consider your own taste.
[26:44.850 --> 26:48.930]  But see, I feel like I am thinking of the audience because most of them are Gen Z and
[26:48.930 --> 26:52.110]  they're growing up in a land of plentiful ice cream flavors.
[26:52.110 --> 26:55.490]  Whereas a Gen X guy, I grew up with three flavors.
[26:55.770 --> 26:56.310]  No, they're not.
[26:56.770 --> 26:57.470]  You're wrong.
[26:57.890 --> 26:58.830]  They're not Gen Z.
[26:59.550 --> 27:00.170]  Are they?
[27:00.390 --> 27:01.110]  They're millennials.
[27:01.410 --> 27:01.610]  You're absolutely wrong.
[27:01.770 --> 27:02.630]  Yes, they're older.
[27:02.710 --> 27:03.910]  They're older than Gen Z.
[27:04.110 --> 27:09.250]  You're so, you're not like, you got like the wrong demographic brain going for what the
[27:09.250 --> 27:09.710]  picks are.
[27:09.990 --> 27:11.510]  I like, these are older.
[27:11.630 --> 27:13.570]  These are like people like my age, Nick's age.
[27:14.270 --> 27:16.850]  Those are the people that pick those Jackie Chan movies.
[27:16.930 --> 27:17.750]  Are you fucking serious?
[27:18.290 --> 27:21.030]  Do you think elder millennials picked those Jackie Chan movies?
[27:21.030 --> 27:22.030]  Yes, yes.
[27:22.050 --> 27:22.530]  Look at them.
[27:22.650 --> 27:23.470]  It's Rush Hour.
[27:23.470 --> 27:25.710]  It came out 2000, Rush Hour 2.
[27:25.870 --> 27:26.610]  So did you guys.
[27:26.610 --> 27:29.110]  You guys are shitting on the picks and saying they're horrible.
[27:29.530 --> 27:31.890]  I went younger and you blew it.
[27:31.890 --> 27:32.330]  No, no, no, no, no.
[27:32.470 --> 27:34.910]  I, I, you guys spent the whole time going, you got to consider the age of the audience.
[27:35.090 --> 27:36.230]  They all, they grew up with the fucking.
[27:36.630 --> 27:40.610]  All I'm saying is I think that vanilla is a boring pick to pick.
[27:40.650 --> 27:44.410]  I don't think anybody eats vanilla ice cream unless it's only the only thing available.
[27:44.750 --> 27:48.030]  You only eat vanilla ice cream if you go to a store and they have a chocolate and vanilla
[27:48.030 --> 27:48.590]  and that's it.
[27:48.610 --> 27:49.890]  And the chocolate's out of order.
[27:50.030 --> 27:51.890]  Probably if it's inside a lolly.
[27:52.510 --> 27:54.230]  Yeah, this is what I want you guys to know.
[27:54.330 --> 27:55.990]  I know you so well, Jeff.
[27:55.990 --> 27:58.010]  Jeff, Gavin, they wish they knew.
[27:58.150 --> 27:59.850]  I know you inside and out.
[28:00.450 --> 28:02.650]  I don't think you want you to think about it.
[28:02.750 --> 28:06.650]  You don't want Eric to know you because to know you for Eric to know you means he doesn't
[28:06.650 --> 28:07.130]  like you.
[28:07.290 --> 28:08.930]  Eric says, I don't like your audience.
[28:09.050 --> 28:09.970]  He's in your head.
[28:09.970 --> 28:11.730]  It's not a compliment what he says.
[28:11.870 --> 28:13.490]  You and I finally agree.
[28:14.290 --> 28:15.170]  Finally agree.
[28:15.510 --> 28:16.290]  That's the sad thing.
[28:16.370 --> 28:17.830]  The difference is I like the audience.
[28:18.770 --> 28:19.210]  Eric.
[28:19.510 --> 28:24.490]  So going off that logic, it tells me something so simple and easy tells me chocolate has
[28:24.490 --> 28:25.390]  to be three or four, right?
[28:26.250 --> 28:26.890]  Here's the thing.
[28:26.970 --> 28:27.930]  Here's the thing about chocolate.
[28:28.010 --> 28:28.990]  I want to say yes.
[28:29.130 --> 28:30.210]  Oh, it could be on the bottom.
[28:30.530 --> 28:32.970]  If it's if it's near the bottom of the list, that's yeah.
[28:33.370 --> 28:34.890]  Let's hey, do it, Nick.
[28:35.230 --> 28:35.590]  Chocolate.
[28:36.310 --> 28:37.550]  That's definitely number four.
[28:39.450 --> 28:42.210]  Gavin says it's definitely number four.
[28:43.290 --> 28:45.150]  It is the three point answer.
[28:46.250 --> 28:50.750]  OK, OK, telling you, Eric, I'm telling you mint chocolate chip is on this list.
[28:50.970 --> 28:52.370]  It's it's I think it is.
[28:52.410 --> 28:54.310]  I'm going to save that one for you because I think I know what I want.
[28:54.470 --> 28:54.990]  OK, all right.
[28:54.990 --> 28:55.730]  I think.
[28:55.830 --> 28:56.930]  What are you going for, Eric?
[28:57.110 --> 28:58.370]  Cookies and cream is on.
[28:58.630 --> 28:59.490]  Oh, that's a good one.
[29:00.350 --> 29:02.090]  Cookies and cream is on this list.
[29:02.130 --> 29:03.250]  Nick got excited about that.
[29:03.770 --> 29:05.310]  Yeah, that's an advanced flavor, I think.
[29:05.930 --> 29:06.330]  Yeah.
[29:06.430 --> 29:08.830]  Do you think cookies and cream would be on your radar team, Gigi?
[29:09.210 --> 29:10.470]  No, I don't think so.
[29:10.930 --> 29:11.470]  Not at all.
[29:12.250 --> 29:15.070]  Well, it barely is on the board.
[29:15.170 --> 29:16.870]  It is the one point answer.
[29:17.070 --> 29:18.350]  This is holy shit.
[29:18.490 --> 29:20.250]  I'm so glad we didn't do this.
[29:20.510 --> 29:20.850]  Cream.
[29:21.330 --> 29:22.250]  Do you want to do it, Nick?
[29:22.670 --> 29:24.270]  I think I'm thinking, yeah, you know what?
[29:24.270 --> 29:27.050]  If I'm wrong, it's going to be something like strawberry.
[29:27.210 --> 29:27.830]  I'm telling you.
[29:27.910 --> 29:27.930]  OK.
[29:29.750 --> 29:30.730]  Mint chocolate chip.
[29:31.650 --> 29:35.870]  Nick says mint chocolate chip as the second most popular answer for four points.
[29:36.270 --> 29:37.590]  If not, I lock up the category.
[29:38.870 --> 29:39.910]  They have locked it up.
[29:39.990 --> 29:41.230]  It is mint chocolate chip.
[29:41.910 --> 29:43.810]  The second most popular.
[29:44.370 --> 29:44.470]  Audience.
[29:44.750 --> 29:45.230]  Audience.
[29:45.630 --> 29:47.130]  I know you so fucking well.
[29:47.130 --> 29:48.270]  I fucking know you.
[29:48.830 --> 29:49.670]  That is you.
[29:49.850 --> 29:51.610]  They handed us the category, Nick.
[29:51.630 --> 29:52.390]  They said here.
[29:52.570 --> 29:52.730]  Back.
[29:52.770 --> 29:53.010]  Here.
[29:53.250 --> 29:53.490]  Back.
[29:54.610 --> 29:58.690]  I'm fucking glad we gave it to you guys, because there's no way we would have got that.
[29:58.810 --> 30:00.250]  Should be 29, shouldn't it, bud?
[30:02.790 --> 30:03.510]  Uh, yes.
[30:04.010 --> 30:04.730]  Thank you.
[30:06.130 --> 30:09.130]  I feel like we should get an extra point for that, but I wouldn't have guessed cookies
[30:09.130 --> 30:10.370]  and cream in a million years.
[30:11.110 --> 30:11.850]  Hey, great job, Eric.
[30:11.930 --> 30:12.950]  No, I was surprised.
[30:12.950 --> 30:13.510]  Cookies and cream.
[30:14.070 --> 30:15.030]  Here's here's my thing.
[30:15.130 --> 30:15.550]  I'll tell you what.
[30:15.610 --> 30:17.890]  Cookies and cream is not a Gen X or a millennial pick.
[30:18.230 --> 30:19.070]  It was.
[30:19.270 --> 30:20.570]  It absolutely is.
[30:20.570 --> 30:26.270]  Because when you go to Baskin Robbins, that's the first time you're going to get the first
[30:26.270 --> 30:28.610]  time you're going to.
[30:28.850 --> 30:29.470]  Oh, man.
[30:29.670 --> 30:30.810]  Oh, what's cookies and cream?
[30:30.930 --> 30:32.850]  I'm six and I'm going to Baskin Robbins.
[30:33.030 --> 30:37.470]  I'm going to try this thing that's close to what I know, but it's not quite that different.
[30:37.830 --> 30:38.970]  That's why cookies and cream made that list.
[30:39.070 --> 30:41.510]  Easy, easy, easiest pick of the whole thing.
[30:41.670 --> 30:42.070]  Oh, damn.
[30:42.670 --> 30:43.550]  Well, hey, great job.
[30:44.170 --> 30:44.590]  Great job, Eric.
[30:44.690 --> 30:45.230]  You got it right.
[30:45.410 --> 30:45.970]  So there you go.
[30:46.230 --> 30:47.570]  You did crushing it.
[30:47.750 --> 30:48.190]  Moving on.
[30:48.210 --> 30:50.030]  And I think it's important for you guys to know.
[30:50.570 --> 30:52.070]  That is the halfway point of the game.
[30:52.130 --> 30:52.890]  We are halfway through.
[30:53.050 --> 30:53.070]  Wow.
[30:53.730 --> 30:58.490]  There are six rounds and then the winning team will move on to a seventh to see if they can
[30:58.490 --> 31:01.110]  claim the regulation championship.
[31:01.590 --> 31:05.570]  But moving on to decider for the round four.
[31:05.990 --> 31:06.530]  This is all you, Eric.
[31:07.250 --> 31:07.570]  All right.
[31:07.650 --> 31:13.350]  According to Heinz.com, how many products, including variations, do they currently have
[31:13.350 --> 31:13.910]  in the U.S. market?
[31:14.290 --> 31:14.950]  Holy shit.
[31:16.010 --> 31:17.790]  Oh, oh, my God.
[31:17.910 --> 31:18.430]  Oh, Eric.
[31:18.590 --> 31:18.670]  That's you, Gav.
[31:19.710 --> 31:22.470]  Oh, it was very funny for Nick to immediately declare.
[31:22.630 --> 31:23.490]  This is all you, Eric.
[31:23.610 --> 31:24.990]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[31:25.050 --> 31:26.150]  I said it before I read it.
[31:26.590 --> 31:29.910]  Yeah, we're putting we're putting the sauce guy on the bench for this one.
[31:30.930 --> 31:32.370]  That's because I believe in Eric, man.
[31:32.650 --> 31:32.850]  Come on.
[31:32.910 --> 31:33.470]  Thanks, man.
[31:33.570 --> 31:37.050]  OK, so it is Nick versus Gavin or Eric versus Gavin.
[31:37.110 --> 31:39.670]  Sorry, Nick's on the bench, including variations.
[31:40.090 --> 31:42.330]  Yeah, that's the one that really gets me, too, because that can.
[31:42.630 --> 31:46.630]  So I will clarify that it's the same sauce, but they're saying it's in like three different
[31:46.630 --> 31:47.270]  bottle sizes.
[31:47.270 --> 31:48.770]  Oh, that's some bullshit.
[31:48.890 --> 31:49.610]  Oh, what?
[31:50.010 --> 31:50.470]  All right.
[31:51.150 --> 31:52.530]  Oh, my God.
[31:52.650 --> 31:53.570]  From all I could tell.
[31:53.750 --> 31:57.930]  And by when I say this, I went on their website and I clicked all products.
[31:57.930 --> 32:01.870]  And this is the number that they displayed is what they had is all.
[32:01.950 --> 32:03.410]  I'm Professor X-ing this to you.
[32:04.050 --> 32:04.310]  OK.
[32:04.670 --> 32:04.970]  OK.
[32:06.430 --> 32:06.950]  Three.
[32:07.170 --> 32:07.590]  You got it.
[32:07.750 --> 32:10.230]  Two, one, go.
[32:10.490 --> 32:11.010]  Four hundred.
[32:11.250 --> 32:12.050]  Fifty seven.
[32:13.370 --> 32:15.810]  OK, we have quite a range.
[32:15.810 --> 32:16.570]  OK, well.
[32:17.690 --> 32:19.410]  Gavin guessing four hundred.
[32:19.810 --> 32:22.390]  We had Eric guessing fifty seven.
[32:22.710 --> 32:26.170]  Nick, what was the number you were trying to send to Eric's brain?
[32:26.410 --> 32:28.250]  I was sending him seventy five.
[32:29.050 --> 32:29.510]  Wow.
[32:29.690 --> 32:30.150]  We all.
[32:30.530 --> 32:31.250]  So what happened?
[32:31.450 --> 32:33.490]  It's because I'm I'm looking at the screen.
[32:33.590 --> 32:34.810]  So it mirrored and it went back.
[32:35.030 --> 32:35.650]  Oh, wow.
[32:35.770 --> 32:36.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:36.710 --> 32:37.250]  Oh, shit.
[32:37.310 --> 32:37.970]  I didn't even realize.
[32:38.090 --> 32:38.430]  Nice.
[32:38.630 --> 32:40.090]  Well, that's tough.
[32:40.190 --> 32:44.490]  And unfortunately, it didn't it didn't really matter because the answer is sixty two.
[32:44.490 --> 32:48.930]  Four hundred way over the guess.
[32:49.110 --> 32:51.710]  The only thing that I thought was Heinz fifty seven.
[32:51.870 --> 32:53.450]  And I just went, I guess that's got to be something.
[32:53.670 --> 32:54.390]  It's close, right?
[32:54.390 --> 32:57.370]  I was thinking fifty seven, but then he said different bottle sizes and stuff.
[32:57.390 --> 32:59.390]  And I was like, well, that could be five of the same thing.
[32:59.550 --> 32:59.710]  Yeah.
[32:59.910 --> 33:00.610]  Yeah, it was.
[33:00.690 --> 33:05.610]  There's like one or two sauces that they listed as different sized bottles for some reason.
[33:06.570 --> 33:08.830]  But that moves on to question four.
[33:09.570 --> 33:11.310]  What is your favorite merch we have sold?
[33:11.410 --> 33:14.270]  Oh, that's do you want to play or pass?
[33:14.270 --> 33:15.990]  No, let's let's think it through.
[33:16.090 --> 33:17.190]  Do we want to play or pass?
[33:17.790 --> 33:20.510]  Man, I don't want to hand it over to them to see what they can do.
[33:20.650 --> 33:24.450]  But I think there's going to be one on there that they're not going to remember shit about
[33:24.450 --> 33:25.810]  and go that fucking thing.
[33:25.910 --> 33:27.750]  And I think I think it's going to fuck them up.
[33:27.970 --> 33:28.290]  You're right.
[33:28.370 --> 33:28.830]  Let's do it.
[33:28.930 --> 33:29.350]  Hand it off.
[33:29.550 --> 33:29.710]  OK.
[33:29.790 --> 33:30.050]  All right.
[33:30.050 --> 33:30.630]  We're going to pass.
[33:30.790 --> 33:32.250]  Team GG go for it.
[33:32.390 --> 33:32.610]  All right.
[33:32.650 --> 33:34.390]  You're going to pass it to the merch guy?
[33:35.050 --> 33:35.190]  Yeah.
[33:35.970 --> 33:38.790]  Well, Gavin, we clearly got in their heads.
[33:38.930 --> 33:40.770]  So let's go ahead and own this.
[33:40.890 --> 33:42.030]  What are you what are you thinking?
[33:43.950 --> 33:46.130]  Oh, do you reckon the scrumping sign will be up there?
[33:46.330 --> 33:47.890]  I think the scrumping sign is a great one.
[33:48.010 --> 33:49.290]  I would definitely go with that.
[33:49.650 --> 33:49.770]  OK.
[33:51.070 --> 33:52.210]  Gavin says scrumping sign.
[33:53.030 --> 33:54.730]  Gavin is going with scrumping sign.
[33:56.150 --> 33:57.750]  Scrumping sign is on the list.
[33:58.010 --> 33:59.650]  It is the two point answer.
[34:00.430 --> 34:00.630]  Nice.
[34:01.010 --> 34:01.350]  Scrumped out.
[34:02.750 --> 34:05.510]  The Falcon stuff is too recent to be on the list.
[34:05.630 --> 34:10.490]  No, I think that because it's so recent, it might be weighted toward it because it's
[34:10.490 --> 34:11.770]  fresh in people's heads.
[34:11.770 --> 34:15.710]  So are we thinking the Falcon sign or the shirt or the shoulder Falcon?
[34:15.930 --> 34:18.490]  I wouldn't say the shirt at all.
[34:18.650 --> 34:20.110]  I'm probably not the sign.
[34:20.310 --> 34:23.870]  I would think the shoulder Falcon is interesting.
[34:24.070 --> 34:26.490]  I wouldn't be surprised if it's not on there, but I'm worth taking a chance on it.
[34:26.530 --> 34:27.490]  I'm going to say shoulder Falcon.
[34:28.150 --> 34:29.810]  Jeff is saying shoulder Falcon.
[34:30.310 --> 34:35.290]  Will his dream of winning this round fly much like the majestic Falcon does?
[34:35.630 --> 34:36.710]  We'll have to find out.
[34:36.730 --> 34:41.510]  But he's at least getting a point for shoulder Falcon being the one point answer.
[34:41.510 --> 34:45.930]  On the list, you guys have cleared out the bottom of the board,
[34:46.690 --> 34:49.030]  leaving you with the top three answers.
[34:49.570 --> 34:51.250]  The five, the four and the three point.
[34:51.890 --> 34:54.630]  Gavin, what is the best merch we sold?
[34:54.750 --> 34:56.210]  The Gerpler is an obvious choice.
[34:56.550 --> 34:56.830]  Yeah.
[34:57.090 --> 34:58.170]  Yeah, I think that's number five.
[34:58.230 --> 34:59.590]  Probably let's go ahead and go with Gerpler.
[34:59.930 --> 35:04.110]  Going Gerpler by a large majority, I would say.
[35:04.410 --> 35:08.330]  Although when we finish the category, I'll get into how some of the data is a little bit wonky
[35:08.330 --> 35:08.650]  on this.
[35:09.130 --> 35:11.690]  Gerpler five points, not even going to like do a thing for it.
[35:11.770 --> 35:12.690]  It's obvious it's there.
[35:13.250 --> 35:14.870]  The five point answer.
[35:15.170 --> 35:16.890]  Leaving the four point and the three point.
[35:17.770 --> 35:20.290]  Jeff, what is your favorite merch we have sold?
[35:20.850 --> 35:23.570]  Gavin, I'm thinking for the four or the three point,
[35:23.690 --> 35:27.810]  one of them is probably going to be the episode 16 LP.
[35:28.030 --> 35:29.330]  How do you feel about that choice?
[35:29.530 --> 35:30.430]  Oh, great one.
[35:30.490 --> 35:31.090]  I forgot about that.
[35:31.930 --> 35:33.530]  It was very highly sought after.
[35:33.690 --> 35:34.750]  Sold out immediately.
[35:34.990 --> 35:37.010]  We had to do a rare second printing.
[35:37.010 --> 35:38.770]  So I feel safe about it.
[35:38.870 --> 35:40.410]  You okay with me picking that?
[35:40.870 --> 35:40.970]  Yep.
[35:41.370 --> 35:42.110]  I'm going to pick that.
[35:43.410 --> 35:45.450]  Episode 16 LP is the official guess.
[35:46.010 --> 35:47.290]  Gavin forgot about it.
[35:48.170 --> 35:49.490]  And so did the audience apparently.
[35:49.870 --> 35:51.210]  Unfortunately, it is not there.
[35:52.070 --> 35:54.210]  First strike against TGG.
[35:55.430 --> 35:55.950]  Okay.
[35:56.910 --> 35:57.930]  Early strike too.
[35:58.690 --> 35:59.850]  What are you thinking, Gav?
[36:06.880 --> 36:10.280]  So we had the NASA stuff we had.
[36:11.800 --> 36:12.580]  Let me know if you need any help.
[36:12.600 --> 36:14.060]  I know what I'm going with, Eric.
[36:14.760 --> 36:15.940]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:15.980 --> 36:16.500]  This is good.
[36:17.080 --> 36:17.100]  Straw.
[36:17.380 --> 36:18.340]  I don't think people like.
[36:18.900 --> 36:19.680]  What are you talking about?
[36:19.980 --> 36:21.180]  I certainly didn't.
[36:21.400 --> 36:23.280]  What a monster that was to try to use.
[36:23.860 --> 36:27.260]  Don't forget about, we have port-a-potty, Tiki mugs.
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.500]  We have pre-hit baseballs.
[36:31.560 --> 36:32.780]  We have bat knobs.
[36:33.560 --> 36:34.980]  Yeah. Oh, we got bat knobs.
[36:35.160 --> 36:36.160]  A lot of popular stuff out there.
[36:36.980 --> 36:37.980]  The misprint hat.
[36:38.660 --> 36:39.900]  Yeah. The fuck, the fuck hat.
[36:40.000 --> 36:40.540]  Russian fuck hat.
[36:40.660 --> 36:41.240]  Russian fuck hat.
[36:41.240 --> 36:42.940]  Oh, bat knobs are interesting.
[36:43.380 --> 36:43.800]  What do you think?
[36:44.660 --> 36:47.780]  I think you got to make sure that whichever one you pick is on the board.
[36:49.640 --> 36:51.600]  That's, dude, that's some good team advice right there.
[36:51.600 --> 36:52.460]  That's a player coach.
[36:52.700 --> 36:55.920]  As the host of this game, I'd sure take a flyer.
[36:56.080 --> 36:56.740]  I'd go with something.
[36:57.240 --> 36:59.100]  I'd go with something you're pretty goddamn certain about.
[36:59.160 --> 37:00.160]  That wasn't limited.
[37:00.300 --> 37:00.920]  Was it the bat knob?
[37:01.280 --> 37:01.760]  Or was it?
[37:02.500 --> 37:04.000]  We sold a thousand of them.
[37:04.760 --> 37:05.120]  Yes.
[37:06.660 --> 37:08.220]  So yeah, I think they were pretty limited.
[37:08.800 --> 37:10.760]  Yeah, I think maybe limited stuff won't be on here because
[37:11.240 --> 37:12.880]  more people didn't have them.
[37:13.820 --> 37:13.840]  Huh.
[37:15.040 --> 37:15.520]  Interesting.
[37:18.530 --> 37:20.150]  How about the beanhole pen?
[37:21.270 --> 37:22.130]  Beanhole pen.
[37:23.870 --> 37:24.970]  I need an answer.
[37:25.130 --> 37:27.230]  Gavin, what is your favorite merch we have sold?
[37:27.830 --> 37:28.690]  Thank you, host.
[37:29.590 --> 37:30.650]  Uh, the pen.
[37:31.690 --> 37:32.950]  Beanhole pen is their guess.
[37:33.330 --> 37:35.370]  You can leave the beanhole pen in the dirt.
[37:35.490 --> 37:37.150]  It is not on the list.
[37:37.350 --> 37:39.030]  That is strike number two.
[37:39.790 --> 37:39.850]  Two strikes, boys!
[37:39.870 --> 37:40.550]  All right, Geoff, you got it.
[37:40.570 --> 37:41.710]  One strike left.
[37:42.830 --> 37:45.810]  Okay, um, what else do we make?
[37:46.390 --> 37:47.790]  What is your favorite merch we have sold?
[37:47.990 --> 37:49.130]  So much stuff.
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.690]  Remember that picture of all the merch?
[37:51.150 --> 37:56.490]  Yeah, uh, the problem here, and it's a problem I'm happy to have,
[37:56.590 --> 38:01.590]  is that we made so much phenomenal and interesting merch over the course of three years
[38:01.590 --> 38:03.130]  that it's really hard to whittle.
[38:03.250 --> 38:07.050]  It's like, it's like trying to pick your favorite A-plus term paper.
[38:07.130 --> 38:08.110]  They're all A-pluses, right?
[38:08.110 --> 38:14.570]  So, uh, I'm gonna go with the pre-hit baseballs.
[38:15.270 --> 38:17.470]  Pre-hit baseballs.
[38:18.190 --> 38:21.670]  Geoff's setting up for a home run to get points on the board
[38:21.670 --> 38:23.070]  because we're near the end of the game.
[38:24.110 --> 38:26.050]  But unfortunately, it's a miss ball.
[38:26.350 --> 38:28.650]  Pre-hit baseballs not on the list.
[38:28.930 --> 38:35.370]  Giving Team N.E. the opportunity to steal and round the bases.
[38:35.590 --> 38:36.150]  I just slacked you.
[38:36.750 --> 38:37.850]  Oh, that's so funny.
[38:37.850 --> 38:38.790]  I just texted you.
[38:38.910 --> 38:39.950]  I just texted you.
[38:39.950 --> 38:43.150]  There's no need for you to slack or text.
[38:43.690 --> 38:45.470]  You can just say what you're thinking.
[38:45.990 --> 38:48.090]  This is your steal opportunity as a team.
[38:48.170 --> 38:49.770]  Wow, Nick, I didn't even think of those.
[38:49.830 --> 38:50.490]  Yeah, what do you think?
[38:50.690 --> 38:50.930]  Holy shit.
[38:51.230 --> 38:53.110]  I think we go with the first one I did for sure, right?
[38:53.510 --> 38:54.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it.
[38:54.750 --> 38:56.210]  All right, the ratty boy shirt.
[38:57.370 --> 39:02.390]  Oh, Nick suggests the ratty boy shirt for the steal.
[39:03.610 --> 39:04.890]  Eric, what were you thinking?
[39:04.970 --> 39:06.830]  Just out of curiosity to build the suspense.
[39:07.550 --> 39:08.890]  Here's what else I was thinking.
[39:09.110 --> 39:10.910]  Because this is our one and only guess on this, right?
[39:11.670 --> 39:13.990]  Well, so you've already guessed what Nick has said.
[39:14.150 --> 39:15.650]  But I'm curious what you were thinking.
[39:16.250 --> 39:16.590]  Right.
[39:17.030 --> 39:20.650]  What I'm asking is that if he gets it right, do we keep going?
[39:20.970 --> 39:21.870]  If he's right, you steal the points.
[39:22.030 --> 39:23.870]  No, if he gets it right, you steal the points.
[39:23.970 --> 39:24.370]  You're all good.
[39:24.650 --> 39:26.670]  If it's wrong, the points go back.
[39:26.810 --> 39:27.310]  I'm just asking.
[39:27.610 --> 39:30.350]  Nick, Nick, I still think yours is a great...
[39:30.350 --> 39:31.790]  I think your guess is the right one to go with.
[39:31.790 --> 39:34.730]  I sent to him Andrew mask.
[39:36.510 --> 39:40.130]  And the protected by falcons sign.
[39:40.970 --> 39:44.330]  I also slacked Eric the anal passage shirt.
[39:44.850 --> 39:48.290]  Yes, anal passage shirt was the other guess that we had.
[39:48.410 --> 39:52.770]  I think all four of these are very, very strong.
[39:52.870 --> 39:54.390]  Anal passage is a great...
[39:54.390 --> 39:55.210]  That is a great one.
[39:55.350 --> 39:55.790]  Great suggestion.
[39:55.890 --> 39:58.470]  All great pieces of merch that were said.
[39:59.970 --> 40:01.190]  None were correct.
[40:01.190 --> 40:04.210]  Team G&G get the points.
[40:04.630 --> 40:07.550]  That brings it 23 to 29.
[40:08.010 --> 40:08.730]  Yeah, OK, what else?
[40:08.830 --> 40:09.870]  Let's start making some guesses.
[40:09.890 --> 40:10.430]  Yes, exactly.
[40:11.090 --> 40:13.090]  Yeah, I want to get something that's more fresh.
[40:13.210 --> 40:14.110]  I'm going to say the cookbook.
[40:15.050 --> 40:16.170]  Cookbook was there.
[40:16.310 --> 40:17.990]  That was the three point answer.
[40:18.250 --> 40:19.350]  Not slop o'clock, surely.
[40:20.230 --> 40:21.690]  No, slop o'clock's not on there.
[40:21.750 --> 40:22.290]  Nobody bought it.
[40:22.290 --> 40:22.510]  Fridge magnet?
[40:23.650 --> 40:25.550]  Fridge magnet was not in the top five.
[40:25.670 --> 40:28.910]  Now, I will say something that should have been in the top five,
[40:28.910 --> 40:31.990]  but people spelled it in so many different ways.
[40:32.050 --> 40:33.230]  It was so hard to compile.
[40:33.470 --> 40:35.810]  But if you scroll through, it probably is in the top five,
[40:35.850 --> 40:36.690]  is the fuck hat.
[40:37.050 --> 40:37.910]  The messed up fuck hat.
[40:37.910 --> 40:38.290]  Oh, yeah.
[40:38.330 --> 40:38.890]  It's not there.
[40:39.490 --> 40:40.650]  You're missing one.
[40:41.010 --> 40:41.490]  Toaster?
[40:42.170 --> 40:43.730]  No, you're missing a classic.
[40:44.670 --> 40:47.410]  No, it was the groan tube.
[40:47.750 --> 40:51.290]  Oh, those didn't fucking move at all.
[40:52.830 --> 40:54.870]  People love the groan tubes, apparently.
[40:55.150 --> 40:57.110]  They like the idea of it more than buying it.
[40:57.490 --> 40:58.070]  Yeah, no kidding.
[40:58.630 --> 41:01.330]  It was... I forgot about so much of that.
[41:01.530 --> 41:02.630]  We made a lot of shit.
[41:02.770 --> 41:03.390]  That's insane.
[41:03.530 --> 41:04.170]  That's crazy.
[41:04.290 --> 41:05.630]  I love how much we forgot, actually.
[41:05.750 --> 41:06.470]  No, that was...
[41:06.910 --> 41:07.330]  The stuff that people love.
[41:07.510 --> 41:07.930]  That was awesome.
[41:07.950 --> 41:12.070]  That category was great because everything that we named
[41:12.070 --> 41:14.970]  was better than the things that ended up on there.
[41:15.410 --> 41:16.770]  Yeah, well, except for the cookbooks.
[41:18.810 --> 41:23.570]  Ratty Boy shirt should be on that list with the amount that I have to fucking see it.
[41:23.570 --> 41:28.630]  Like, Anal Passage shirt was number one with a bullet.
[41:28.850 --> 41:31.450]  It was like our most... it was like our highest selling item.
[41:31.570 --> 41:34.550]  It was the most high selling item in the company that year, I think.
[41:34.710 --> 41:36.790]  Yes, yes, it was. Yeah, it destroyed.
[41:37.170 --> 41:40.030]  Oh, that's so fucking funny.
[41:42.250 --> 41:44.830]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[41:45.230 --> 41:48.510]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[41:48.650 --> 41:50.750]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[41:50.750 --> 41:54.190]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[41:54.410 --> 41:58.610]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[41:58.870 --> 42:02.350]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[42:02.590 --> 42:04.610]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[42:07.790 --> 42:09.090]  Hey, it's Paris.
[42:09.550 --> 42:11.690]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[42:11.950 --> 42:12.710]  Like stars.
[42:13.130 --> 42:13.450]  Duh.
[42:13.950 --> 42:17.590]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[42:17.590 --> 42:22.490]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[42:22.710 --> 42:27.170]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[42:27.730 --> 42:30.230]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[42:30.750 --> 42:31.470]  That's hot.
[42:32.150 --> 42:35.150]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[42:35.490 --> 42:36.850]  Hilton for the stay.
[42:37.210 --> 42:44.570]  So it looks like Team GG has got 23 points and Team Northeast has 29 points.
[42:45.670 --> 42:51.110]  Let's see which direction success is blowing with this next category.
[42:51.910 --> 42:55.190]  Andrew, we're going to the decider.
[42:55.510 --> 42:56.950]  I didn't expect you to keep going, Jeff.
[42:57.050 --> 42:59.250]  When you said my name, I thought that was a clear throwaway.
[42:59.270 --> 43:00.390]  You didn't step on.
[43:00.730 --> 43:01.950]  Yeah, I did.
[43:02.030 --> 43:03.270]  Jeff, you threw it perfectly.
[43:03.530 --> 43:04.530]  You didn't step on.
[43:04.770 --> 43:06.610]  No, I threw it perfectly and I went, tick, tick.
[43:06.850 --> 43:07.790]  I was like, that's my little...
[43:08.810 --> 43:09.570]  Oh, I see.
[43:09.650 --> 43:10.070]  I didn't see.
[43:10.170 --> 43:11.630]  I thought you like shoulder pumped it.
[43:11.690 --> 43:12.770]  I thought that was a pump fake.
[43:12.770 --> 43:15.170]  And I jumped the gun a little bit on that.
[43:15.290 --> 43:16.310]  I thought I missed that.
[43:17.050 --> 43:19.310]  As you see, Team GG versus Team New England.
[43:19.670 --> 43:22.310]  Team New England leading by six points.
[43:23.170 --> 43:24.450]  We are game four.
[43:24.630 --> 43:27.230]  We're going into the decider for game five.
[43:27.710 --> 43:28.490]  Or round five, I guess.
[43:29.310 --> 43:29.790]  Decider!
[43:30.630 --> 43:32.690]  Who wants to take this on?
[43:33.210 --> 43:34.810]  I should have asked before I scrolled down.
[43:35.710 --> 43:39.370]  We need one person from each team being willing to...
[43:39.370 --> 43:39.490]  I think Eric should.
[43:40.050 --> 43:40.610]  Okay, Eric.
[43:41.830 --> 43:44.270]  Wait, Nick, did you just tell me that I'm doing it?
[43:44.490 --> 43:44.650]  Yep.
[43:44.770 --> 43:45.690]  Yeah, you sure did.
[43:45.890 --> 43:47.230]  Gavin, you should probably do it too.
[43:47.850 --> 43:49.110]  No, no, what do you mean?
[43:49.250 --> 43:49.530]  I feel like you're luckier.
[43:49.690 --> 43:51.690]  Okay, Gavin, we got it.
[43:51.810 --> 43:52.630]  Eric versus Gavin.
[43:52.830 --> 43:53.990]  No, I'm going to need you.
[43:55.110 --> 43:55.950]  So what do you mean?
[43:56.310 --> 43:57.110]  I'm going to need you.
[43:57.730 --> 43:58.250]  We can win.
[43:58.890 --> 43:59.110]  What?
[43:59.450 --> 44:01.290]  I don't know the answer to any of this shit.
[44:01.930 --> 44:03.450]  I don't even know what the question means.
[44:03.750 --> 44:06.250]  That might give you an edge.
[44:06.390 --> 44:06.970]  Who knows?
[44:07.390 --> 44:09.790]  What I'm going to need is for you both to slack me
[44:10.610 --> 44:11.950]  a number in a minute.
[44:12.130 --> 44:13.490]  I'm going to read the question to Cider5.
[44:13.890 --> 44:17.390]  How many players were selected in the first NFL draft?
[44:17.990 --> 44:19.090]  Gavin, you've done a bunch of gaffes.
[44:19.770 --> 44:21.170]  Not gaffes, drafts.
[44:21.250 --> 44:22.690]  Jesus, fuck me.
[44:22.790 --> 44:24.350]  And you haven't done a bunch of gaffes.
[44:25.630 --> 44:27.250]  Are you trying to confuse me even more?
[44:27.250 --> 44:28.290]  No, no, no, I know.
[44:28.370 --> 44:29.690]  Yeah, that was, that was...
[44:29.690 --> 44:30.150]  I'm sorry.
[44:30.510 --> 44:31.150]  You don't need that.
[44:31.530 --> 44:32.530]  You're already struggling.
[44:33.630 --> 44:35.610]  The first NFL gaffe in history.
[44:35.750 --> 44:37.130]  Yeah, the first NFL gaffe in history.
[44:37.230 --> 44:38.210]  Yeah, how many players were drafted?
[44:38.550 --> 44:39.930]  Nick, let's think about this gaffe.
[44:39.930 --> 44:42.950]  There were probably a lot less teams in the NFL back then.
[44:42.990 --> 44:44.970]  There were less players to be drafted.
[44:45.550 --> 44:46.530]  You can't have...
[44:46.530 --> 44:46.730]  What?
[44:47.490 --> 44:48.770]  Wait, hang on.
[44:48.910 --> 44:52.610]  I said I'm going to slack you a number and that was immediately you can't help.
[44:52.750 --> 44:54.250]  But Jeff went on like...
[44:55.330 --> 44:57.790]  Listen, we're getting the rust off this game.
[44:58.170 --> 44:59.150]  Yeah, we're just knocking the rust off.
[44:59.210 --> 44:59.830]  I didn't hear that part.
[45:00.370 --> 45:01.110]  This is ridiculous.
[45:01.590 --> 45:03.030]  You haven't sent me a number yet.
[45:03.350 --> 45:04.770]  Because I'm going to talk to Nick about...
[45:04.770 --> 45:05.370]  Okay, all right.
[45:05.370 --> 45:06.270]  I'm just going to go with my gut.
[45:06.450 --> 45:06.830]  Did it.
[45:06.910 --> 45:07.070]  Done.
[45:07.730 --> 45:08.450]  Oh, cool.
[45:08.730 --> 45:09.450]  Thanks, man.
[45:09.930 --> 45:10.850]  Are you kidding me?
[45:12.770 --> 45:13.810]  Jesus Christ.
[45:14.050 --> 45:15.350]  No, disqualified.
[45:15.890 --> 45:17.290]  We're not doing this.
[45:17.690 --> 45:18.990]  We're not doing this.
[45:18.990 --> 45:19.970]  This is bullshit.
[45:20.690 --> 45:21.690]  This is over.
[45:21.910 --> 45:22.650]  This is done.
[45:23.170 --> 45:23.770]  This is done.
[45:24.330 --> 45:24.990]  Throw it out.
[45:25.290 --> 45:25.830]  Throw it out.
[45:25.830 --> 45:29.010]  Guys, thank you so much for watching Regulation Feud.
[45:29.270 --> 45:31.110]  Is this a fucking joke?
[45:31.230 --> 45:32.470]  We waited two months.
[45:33.010 --> 45:34.810]  We waited two months for this.
[45:36.270 --> 45:37.470]  Is this a joke?
[45:38.150 --> 45:39.530]  Are you kidding me, Andrew?
[45:39.930 --> 45:42.210]  Did you just fuck it up that bad?
[45:42.330 --> 45:43.670]  Gavin, what was your guess?
[45:44.090 --> 45:44.670]  Eighty-one.
[45:44.770 --> 45:45.650]  You've shot...
[45:45.650 --> 45:47.230]  No, absolutely not.
[45:47.370 --> 45:48.070]  No, protest.
[45:48.250 --> 45:48.650]  What do you mean?
[45:48.910 --> 45:51.290]  I respect your protest.
[45:51.510 --> 45:51.830]  I'm sorry.
[45:51.950 --> 45:52.530]  That's on me.
[45:52.770 --> 45:53.310]  That's my fault.
[45:53.310 --> 45:54.490]  You're right to be mad.
[45:55.270 --> 45:59.490]  However, Gavin is correct with the exact right answer.
[45:59.890 --> 46:02.770]  Eighty-one is the correct answer.
[46:03.730 --> 46:06.010]  Eighty-one is the exact answer.
[46:06.510 --> 46:06.650]  Protest.
[46:06.830 --> 46:07.170]  No.
[46:08.610 --> 46:09.130]  Technicality.
[46:09.270 --> 46:09.610]  No.
[46:09.610 --> 46:10.190]  Down.
[46:10.270 --> 46:10.550]  Boo.
[46:11.030 --> 46:11.330]  Over.
[46:11.490 --> 46:13.390]  What a good guess.
[46:14.090 --> 46:15.810]  No, we're not doing this.
[46:16.030 --> 46:16.530]  No.
[46:17.310 --> 46:18.030]  You've won.
[46:18.390 --> 46:19.250]  You have to decide.
[46:19.350 --> 46:20.070]  Do you want to play?
[46:20.150 --> 46:20.430]  No.
[46:20.650 --> 46:21.890]  Do you want to play or pass?
[46:22.350 --> 46:22.970]  What do you mean?
[46:23.150 --> 46:29.630]  Oh, it's family feud, but it's regulation because it's surveyed by our community members.
[46:29.990 --> 46:37.630]  This is legitimately, in our tenure of being a company, you had no idea what it was.
[46:37.930 --> 46:39.590]  You had no idea what it was.
[46:39.590 --> 46:41.350]  There was no prep.
[46:41.630 --> 46:43.030]  This is the worst thing.
[46:43.330 --> 46:46.470]  Andrew, we waited two months to do this last part.
[46:46.770 --> 46:49.370]  This is the worst thing we've ever recorded.
[46:49.970 --> 46:52.030]  Something about Eric's new mixer.
[46:52.210 --> 46:54.270]  Whenever he gets mad, I can't hear anything he says.
[46:55.070 --> 46:58.450]  No, I was thinking at the process of my head how this would work in the show.
[46:58.730 --> 46:59.770]  You would get to see the question.
[47:00.050 --> 47:00.990]  It is best Halo game.
[47:01.050 --> 47:01.970]  Do you want to play or pass?
[47:02.510 --> 47:05.770]  Well, surely in the game, we would be buzzing in on that, wouldn't we?
[47:05.990 --> 47:06.630]  No, you wouldn't.
[47:06.710 --> 47:09.010]  First of all, you don't even fucking know what this game is.
[47:09.010 --> 47:11.290]  You just remembered it 20 seconds ago.
[47:11.390 --> 47:13.090]  Don't tell me how this game works.
[47:13.270 --> 47:14.630]  I think we'll play, Jeff, right?
[47:14.990 --> 47:15.490]  Best Halo game?
[47:15.590 --> 47:16.650]  Yeah, sure, man.
[47:18.870 --> 47:21.350]  In the real game, it would be that as third category.
[47:21.550 --> 47:22.870]  Okay, Jeff, this sucks.
[47:23.270 --> 47:24.670]  Gavin, you are playing.
[47:25.050 --> 47:25.210]  Boo.
[47:25.490 --> 47:26.830]  Eric, you have the lead.
[47:29.370 --> 47:31.910]  Yeah, no shit, because I would have won.
[47:32.130 --> 47:32.590]  Oh my god.
[47:32.590 --> 47:34.030]  There's like six Halo games.
[47:34.090 --> 47:35.050]  How could they fuck this up?
[47:35.150 --> 47:36.470]  There's quite a few Halo games.
[47:36.810 --> 47:37.950]  There's way more than six.
[47:37.950 --> 47:39.970]  The fact you think there's only six, that's a problem for you.
[47:40.090 --> 47:41.830]  I mean, there's two that are obviously bad.
[47:42.490 --> 47:44.890]  That's not necessarily true.
[47:45.090 --> 47:45.910]  Don't help us.
[47:46.270 --> 47:46.850]  Don't worry.
[47:46.950 --> 47:47.470]  I'm not helping.
[47:47.850 --> 47:51.590]  I'm just saying, Jeff, what is one of the best Halo games?
[47:51.970 --> 47:52.450]  Halo 3.
[47:53.970 --> 47:58.850]  Halo 3 is Jeff's guess.
[48:00.310 --> 48:05.190]  Halo 3 is the five point answer.
[48:06.330 --> 48:06.850]  What?
[48:06.850 --> 48:08.770]  The fifth best?
[48:09.030 --> 48:10.790]  I think, no, it's the most popular.
[48:10.950 --> 48:11.830]  It's the number one answer.
[48:12.090 --> 48:12.670]  Five points.
[48:12.950 --> 48:13.530]  It's the number one.
[48:13.710 --> 48:14.710]  Yeah, I had to remember.
[48:15.530 --> 48:16.850]  We're all getting, you know, we're figuring this out.
[48:16.930 --> 48:17.610]  So that was a great guess.
[48:17.710 --> 48:19.350]  I think we got fucked, Eric.
[48:19.630 --> 48:20.570]  Yeah, no shit.
[48:20.930 --> 48:23.370]  It says three, four, three words.
[48:23.450 --> 48:24.490]  That's very Halo, isn't it?
[48:28.430 --> 48:29.130]  It is.
[48:29.490 --> 48:29.970]  Yeah, you're right.
[48:30.890 --> 48:31.770]  It's a whole company.
[48:32.350 --> 48:32.990]  Halo 2.
[48:34.130 --> 48:36.590]  Halo 2 is Gavin's guess.
[48:37.490 --> 48:41.470]  Halo 2 is the second most popular, according to our listeners.
[48:42.370 --> 48:44.450]  Our wonderful community members.
[48:44.770 --> 48:48.150]  Jeff, what's one of the best Halo games?
[48:49.270 --> 48:50.010]  Halo Reach.
[48:51.150 --> 48:58.230]  Halo Reach is the third most popular answer to this question.
[49:09.710 --> 49:12.490]  Gavin, name one of the best Halo games.
[49:14.630 --> 49:19.130]  Jeff, do you think ODST would be above 4 and 5?
[49:20.090 --> 49:22.930]  Do you think 4 and 5 would be above 2 or 1?
[49:24.110 --> 49:24.710]  Well, it...
[49:24.710 --> 49:25.470]  Oh, 2 is already in there.
[49:25.510 --> 49:25.970]  Sorry, 1.
[49:26.530 --> 49:27.570]  I think ODST...
[49:29.970 --> 49:30.890]  Yeah, I think...
[49:31.270 --> 49:32.310]  Yeah, I think so.
[49:33.130 --> 49:34.230]  Or we could just throw in Halo 1.
[49:34.470 --> 49:35.590]  I just feel like less people played it.
[49:35.590 --> 49:38.750]  Yeah, well, go with your gut.
[49:38.870 --> 49:40.290]  You're more of a Halo guy than me.
[49:40.970 --> 49:41.790]  All I ever did was...
[49:43.030 --> 49:43.890]  Halo Protest.
[49:45.810 --> 49:47.170]  I'll go ODST.
[49:50.270 --> 49:51.310]  Halo ODST...
[49:52.070 --> 49:54.030]  is the fourth most popular answer.
[49:54.210 --> 49:54.630]  Okay.
[50:01.690 --> 50:03.090]  It's Halo 3 ODST.
[50:03.490 --> 50:03.890]  Get it right?
[50:04.490 --> 50:05.370]  No, I'm good.
[50:06.230 --> 50:07.610]  And, uh, Jeff?
[50:07.610 --> 50:10.970]  Uh, what do you think, Gavin?
[50:11.190 --> 50:12.710]  Halo, Halo 4 or 5.
[50:12.810 --> 50:14.730]  I'm assuming it's going to be one of those fellas.
[50:15.590 --> 50:17.870]  Would people put Halo Wars above Halo?
[50:18.310 --> 50:20.230]  No, it wasn't very popular at all.
[50:22.170 --> 50:23.130]  Would people put...
[50:23.130 --> 50:25.970]  I would say 5 wasn't popular.
[50:26.150 --> 50:27.170]  4 was kind of popular.
[50:27.770 --> 50:31.370]  I feel like 4 is not better than 1.
[50:32.290 --> 50:33.090]  No, of course not.
[50:33.490 --> 50:34.430]  So let's say Halo 1.
[50:34.730 --> 50:34.890]  Yeah.
[50:35.210 --> 50:35.950]  Halo Combat Evolved.
[50:37.610 --> 50:39.670]  Halo 1 is their guess.
[50:41.350 --> 50:44.930]  Halo 1 is the least popular game.
[50:45.090 --> 50:46.590]  They run it out.
[50:48.730 --> 50:53.170]  Team GG wins the first episode.
[50:54.030 --> 50:55.650]  The last episode.
[50:55.850 --> 50:57.890]  The last episode of Regulation Feud.
[50:59.030 --> 51:00.370]  I'm so sorry.
[51:01.630 --> 51:02.610]  What do you mean?
[51:02.790 --> 51:05.510]  You could have picked a different, like, decided.
[51:05.950 --> 51:06.870]  You could have changed it.
[51:06.870 --> 51:07.830]  I don't...
[51:07.830 --> 51:08.310]  You could have looked something up.
[51:08.690 --> 51:09.510]  I guess I could have.
[51:09.750 --> 51:09.890]  What?
[51:09.970 --> 51:11.610]  You should have made that suggestion at the time.
[51:11.910 --> 51:14.730]  That was the contestant's fault on that one.
[51:15.330 --> 51:16.750]  Winners, GG.
[51:17.830 --> 51:19.370]  Losers, Team New England.
[51:20.730 --> 51:22.450]  Listen, shows make mistakes.
[51:22.990 --> 51:23.630]  Nothing's perfect.
[51:23.630 --> 51:23.870]  What just happened?
[51:24.250 --> 51:25.230]  Shows make mistakes.
[51:25.750 --> 51:26.470]  They don't ever.
[51:26.830 --> 51:31.610]  I will never be participating in another Regulation Feud as long as we are a company.
[51:32.230 --> 51:33.070]  How did this happen?
[51:33.970 --> 51:35.830]  We'll be back next time.
[51:35.830 --> 51:37.250]  Andrew did no prep.
[51:37.450 --> 51:38.630]  Andrew blew it.
[51:38.870 --> 51:39.750]  And here we are.
[51:40.110 --> 51:44.230]  I would feel bad about that win if this was any other show.
[51:48.440 --> 51:50.100]  Salad creaming to the...
[51:50.780 --> 51:51.900]  The pop-up.
[51:52.020 --> 51:56.160]  The fact that Eric picked one below what the correct answer was
[51:56.160 --> 52:01.660]  and then Gavin just picked one above his is insane.
[52:05.780 --> 52:06.860]  Not insane.
[52:06.860 --> 52:08.220]  Absolutely not insane.
[52:08.500 --> 52:09.240]  Pretty crazy.
[52:09.620 --> 52:13.080]  Anyway, thank you so much for watching.
[52:13.860 --> 52:16.940]  Check out our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.
[52:17.620 --> 52:19.360]  Regulatrion.com.
[52:20.620 --> 52:25.840]  Considering what I erased from the text box before putting anyone else in the same way.
[52:27.240 --> 52:28.340]  Save your money.
[52:30.360 --> 52:32.560]  I file this under protest.
[52:33.020 --> 52:34.180]  It's under protest.
[52:34.520 --> 52:35.060]  Goodbye.
[52:40.190 --> 52:41.210]  We should do a sync.
[52:42.550 --> 52:43.470]  Just use that.
[52:45.430 --> 52:45.910]  Okay.
[52:46.430 --> 52:47.130]  One, two, three.
[52:47.290 --> 52:48.330]  One, two, three.
[52:49.290 --> 52:50.810]  I'm not even recording yet.
[52:51.570 --> 52:56.070]  Five, four, three, two, one.
[52:56.290 --> 52:57.130]  That was for real.
[52:57.150 --> 52:58.570]  Do you think Andrew counted down on that one?
[52:59.310 --> 53:01.090]  He's still muted, so maybe not.
[53:01.930 --> 53:03.170]  He did. There's no shot.
[53:03.210 --> 53:04.030]  No, I did.
[53:04.370 --> 53:06.970]  But it was close because I was sharing my screen.
[53:07.510 --> 53:08.590]  Why was it close?
[53:08.590 --> 53:10.190]  Because I was sharing my screen.
[53:10.310 --> 53:11.370]  I was focused on that.
[53:11.710 --> 53:12.290]  With your mouth?
[53:12.690 --> 53:13.170]  Focused?
[53:13.670 --> 53:15.570]  Yeah, my brain was locked in.
[53:15.850 --> 53:17.990]  I'm trying to get things organized.
[53:18.290 --> 53:18.550]  Relax.
[53:18.870 --> 53:27.790]  Yeah, guys, I clicked the live button and then I clicked the two clicks past it.
[53:27.930 --> 53:28.830]  Oh my God.
[53:28.990 --> 53:30.650]  I remembered I had to do it.
[53:30.750 --> 53:32.570]  And so I was like, oh, what do I got to click this?
[53:32.590 --> 53:35.670]  And then there's like six tabs and we got there.
[53:35.710 --> 53:36.150]  I did it.
[53:36.170 --> 53:36.830]  I did both.
[53:36.830 --> 53:39.390]  But it was definitely a close.
[53:39.570 --> 53:40.190]  I made all three.
[53:40.490 --> 53:40.750]  No problem.
[53:40.870 --> 53:45.630]  So Nick, does the sync matter if we didn't get anything with his screen the first time
[53:45.630 --> 53:46.890]  or it doesn't matter to you?
[53:46.930 --> 53:49.670]  No, it's fine, because I'll have this to sync to our audio.
[53:49.870 --> 53:50.550]  I'm recording it.
[53:50.850 --> 53:52.150]  So do you remember this, Gavin?
[53:55.480 --> 53:56.340]  There's no shot.
[53:56.440 --> 53:56.800]  He remembers.
[53:56.900 --> 53:57.720]  He doesn't remember this at all.
[53:58.200 --> 53:59.100]  This is what we were doing.
[53:59.560 --> 54:00.820]  This is what we were doing.
[54:09.260 --> 54:10.180]  Oh my God.
[54:10.280 --> 54:13.200]  I can't wait to hear these two clips sandwiched together.
[54:13.280 --> 54:16.160]  So we're just going to continue and not mention that it's later.
[54:16.260 --> 54:16.960]  We're just going to...
[54:16.960 --> 54:18.760]  We can do whatever we want.
[54:18.860 --> 54:20.980]  We ended in a way I was like, oh, we got to end it.
[54:21.040 --> 54:22.500]  We'll do another ending some other time.
[54:22.520 --> 54:23.520]  And I just think that sucks.
[54:23.660 --> 54:24.160]  So I thought...
[54:24.160 --> 54:27.680]  You think that all of this isn't in this right now?
[54:28.160 --> 54:28.720]  That's a good point.
[54:29.360 --> 54:31.420]  I mean, I just started recording like a minute ago.
[54:32.000 --> 54:32.860]  But yeah, Craig.
[54:33.220 --> 54:33.760]  One, two, three.
[54:33.880 --> 54:34.200]  You have a Craigmas here.
[54:34.200 --> 54:34.760]  One, two, three.
[54:35.200 --> 54:35.980]  All right.
[54:36.700 --> 54:37.180]  Okay.
[54:38.100 --> 54:39.840]  Here's how we could link it.
[54:41.660 --> 54:42.000]  Uh.
[54:43.220 --> 54:46.340]  Oh, yeah, the grow tube.
[54:48.140 --> 54:48.620]  Okay.
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.600]  Now go ahead and express to me how you think this links.
