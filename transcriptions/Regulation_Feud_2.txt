[00:52.160 --> 00:59.760]  Hello and welcome to episode two of Regulation Feud. In a best of three series,
[00:59.960 --> 01:05.000]  we have Team Annie versus Team Gigi. How are you guys doing?
[01:05.460 --> 01:10.960]  Great. Yeah, this is under protest. We will not be... this doesn't... none of this matters.
[01:11.600 --> 01:15.220]  Thank you for listening to this thing that doesn't matter. We appreciate you so much.
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.420]  Listen, you protested the first game fairly, understandably.
[01:20.320 --> 01:24.080]  This is a whole new game. You can't protest this game. Nothing's happened in this game yet.
[01:24.320 --> 01:27.120]  No, just based on how it's been going the last 20 minutes,
[01:27.200 --> 01:30.160]  I'm getting ahead of the curve and protesting this one too.
[01:30.380 --> 01:33.120]  Yeah, he's filing a pre-protest. Absolutely.
[01:33.220 --> 01:38.520]  I'm going to acknowledge your pre-protest doo-doo what... well, the effects of last game.
[01:38.580 --> 01:44.740]  I said doo-doo, that's funny. I said doo-doo, that was real funny.
[01:45.080 --> 01:47.440]  That was real hard for me to step away from that.
[01:48.900 --> 01:52.280]  This is awful. Anyway, we got the same teams.
[01:53.840 --> 01:58.700]  You know, was the end of the last game unfairly given to a certain team? Who can say?
[01:59.920 --> 02:01.840]  I mean, we knew our Halo. Yeah.
[02:02.100 --> 02:04.000]  Listen, if they didn't know their Halo...
[02:04.000 --> 02:05.620]  Guess what? We had the same answer.
[02:05.880 --> 02:10.700]  Yeah, like absolutely. Which of the other Halos would you have picked? Like, yeah, put five in
[02:10.700 --> 02:11.460]  there? Like...
[02:11.460 --> 02:13.380]  Here's the thing, Eric. If you would have guessed 81,
[02:13.700 --> 02:16.220]  then Gavin would have been 82 and you would have won.
[02:16.220 --> 02:18.560]  So really, if you were just one off, that would have been you.
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.860]  I mean, none of this matters. It doesn't matter. Hey, why don't you go ahead and show me how to
[02:22.860 --> 02:25.440]  share a window again, Andrew? We can spend five more minutes on that, man.
[02:25.640 --> 02:27.220]  Eric, what have we done that did matter?
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.540]  That's a great question.
[02:31.540 --> 02:33.220]  Gavin, that's a pretty fair question.
[02:33.980 --> 02:35.740]  Back in. Protest over.
[02:36.100 --> 02:38.460]  Ooh, protest removed. All right, here we go.
[02:39.180 --> 02:41.200]  Protest definitely not removed, but we're still in this.
[02:41.520 --> 02:42.060]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.140]  Nick and Gavin.
[02:44.720 --> 02:46.820]  No, Gavin's last time. It'd be Nick and Jeff this time.
[02:46.840 --> 02:49.100]  Well, you pick. You guys pick. You do whatever you want.
[02:49.100 --> 02:50.320]  We want to go with Nick and Gavin.
[02:50.700 --> 02:51.980]  Yeah, let's go with Nick and Gavin.
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.340]  Let's go with Nick and Gavin.
[02:54.340 --> 02:59.960]  The decider for this one is how many unique video games feature ET?
[03:00.420 --> 03:02.940]  How many unique games feature ET? I'm going to count down.
[03:03.460 --> 03:04.380]  Should I email it to you?
[03:04.640 --> 03:06.380]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't, don't count down.
[03:06.800 --> 03:07.900]  What are we doing? We just.
[03:08.100 --> 03:09.980]  Oh, yeah, yeah, just like me. Yeah, yeah, it's like me. Yeah, it's like.
[03:10.800 --> 03:14.120]  Oh, I'm going to. Andrew, I'm going to fucking flip, dude.
[03:14.120 --> 03:15.420]  This is insane.
[03:17.240 --> 03:18.900]  Specifically, specifically ET.
[03:20.880 --> 03:22.080]  Specifically ET.
[03:22.700 --> 03:23.840]  The extraterrestrial.
[03:24.260 --> 03:26.180]  Yeah, the extraterrestrial.
[03:26.320 --> 03:28.020]  The Steven Spielberg classic.
[03:28.380 --> 03:29.840]  Feel free to slack me.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.700]  Are references included?
[03:32.040 --> 03:33.100]  Jeff, I'm going to throw up.
[03:33.380 --> 03:36.260]  I'm sorry, Eric, you're, you're, you're, you're.
[03:36.880 --> 03:37.180]  Roadcast.
[03:37.200 --> 03:39.900]  I've received a guess from Gavin.
[03:40.700 --> 03:42.740]  Nick, could you send me your guess?
[03:43.400 --> 03:47.880]  Uh, clarification, not references, just actually about ET.
[03:48.560 --> 03:50.940]  Uh, games that ET is in.
[03:51.220 --> 03:52.660]  Like the character is physically in.
[03:53.100 --> 03:55.280]  Yes, I have both numbers.
[03:56.260 --> 03:58.360]  Nick said six.
[03:59.200 --> 04:01.220]  Gavin said 21.
[04:01.680 --> 04:05.860]  The correct answer to the game is 13.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.040]  Nick, you narrowly win for your team.
[04:10.600 --> 04:10.980]  Damn it.
[04:10.980 --> 04:17.760]  Let's scroll to the next question, which is what is the most iconic video game character?
[04:18.160 --> 04:19.840]  Oh, do you want to play or pass?
[04:20.560 --> 04:21.640]  We want to play.
[04:21.900 --> 04:23.160]  Wow, right into it.
[04:23.340 --> 04:25.840]  OK, most iconic video game character.
[04:25.960 --> 04:26.760]  What do you guys think?
[04:26.960 --> 04:28.300]  We can't leave it to chance again.
[04:28.360 --> 04:29.100]  That's or Andrew.
[04:29.320 --> 04:29.500]  Yeah.
[04:33.140 --> 04:36.000]  Uh, do you want to take the first crack at this one?
[04:36.020 --> 04:36.580]  You want me to?
[04:36.960 --> 04:39.280]  Hey, you guys can go back and forth if you want to talk about it.
[04:39.280 --> 04:40.540]  Yeah, we could talk.
[04:40.740 --> 04:42.920]  I'm leaning towards like Sonic or Mario.
[04:43.120 --> 04:45.020]  Yeah, I mean, I think I think Mario has to be the first guess.
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.900]  Yeah, I think Mario is the first guess.
[04:48.340 --> 04:49.360]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:49.380 --> 04:50.700]  We already said we're going to already said that.
[04:50.820 --> 04:51.760]  I already locked that in.
[04:54.460 --> 04:57.440]  The most popular guess is Mario.
[04:58.080 --> 04:59.520]  Knock that out already.
[04:59.960 --> 05:05.020]  Now, now do you think now, Nick, do you think that the number four is Sonic the Hedgehog?
[05:05.280 --> 05:06.440]  But this group, I don't know.
[05:06.480 --> 05:08.300]  Here's the thing, like our audience.
[05:09.400 --> 05:09.820]  Are they?
[05:10.200 --> 05:11.580]  You think they're a little younger than us?
[05:11.660 --> 05:12.740]  No, I just think they're freaks.
[05:13.180 --> 05:13.580]  Oh, yeah.
[05:13.660 --> 05:14.640]  So then maybe Master Chief?
[05:14.880 --> 05:16.880]  Oh, Master Chief might be a good guess, but I kind of.
[05:17.140 --> 05:18.080]  Yeah, let's go with it.
[05:18.140 --> 05:18.480]  I don't care.
[05:18.620 --> 05:19.080]  Let's do it.
[05:19.200 --> 05:19.820]  None of this matters.
[05:19.880 --> 05:20.520]  It's all under protest.
[05:20.640 --> 05:21.040]  It doesn't matter.
[05:21.500 --> 05:21.780]  Absolutely.
[05:22.660 --> 05:23.320]  Yeah, Master Chief.
[05:23.700 --> 05:24.340]  We'll do Master Chief.
[05:24.440 --> 05:26.500]  Yeah, Master Chief is the guess.
[05:26.840 --> 05:27.680]  I'm going to say he's number two.
[05:28.520 --> 05:29.360]  Probably or three.
[05:30.480 --> 05:31.040]  John 117.
[05:32.200 --> 05:32.760]  Yeah, baby.
[05:32.960 --> 05:33.620]  Is that his name?
[05:34.380 --> 05:35.860]  Yeah, that's his name and designation.
[05:36.220 --> 05:36.600]  Legal name.
[05:36.600 --> 05:38.960]  His most, the most iconic.
[05:40.780 --> 05:45.940]  Two most iconic video game characters, a guy named John 117.
[05:46.200 --> 05:47.780]  Mario and John 117.
[05:48.360 --> 05:49.160]  Most iconic.
[05:49.520 --> 05:53.080]  I went to the Halo 3 UK premiere at the IMAX theater in London,
[05:53.080 --> 05:56.720]  and when a Master Chief came out, everyone started chanting John.
[05:59.820 --> 06:02.180]  I don't know Halo at all.
[06:02.420 --> 06:04.200]  I have not beat any of these games.
[06:04.300 --> 06:06.500]  I don't know shit about John 117.
[06:07.500 --> 06:08.480]  It doesn't matter.
[06:08.620 --> 06:09.100]  Why do I ask?
[06:09.160 --> 06:09.580]  It doesn't matter.
[06:09.700 --> 06:10.760]  He's a super soldier.
[06:10.940 --> 06:12.620]  He's like Captain America, kind of.
[06:12.900 --> 06:13.360]  Yeah, yeah.
[06:13.540 --> 06:16.380]  He was abducted as a child and replaced with a clone that died.
[06:16.720 --> 06:17.520]  A Flash clone.
[06:17.800 --> 06:19.600]  They died out like within a year or two.
[06:19.760 --> 06:19.920]  Yeah.
[06:20.420 --> 06:24.260]  I thought it was like, I thought like the suit made him powerful or something.
[06:24.700 --> 06:28.960]  Well, they're super human augmented and then the suit makes them stronger.
[06:30.180 --> 06:32.460]  Anyway, what's the most iconic video game character?
[06:32.660 --> 06:35.240]  I think it's gotta be, I think Sonic the Hedgehog is on this list.
[06:35.260 --> 06:35.940]  Yeah, let's do Sonic.
[06:35.940 --> 06:36.900]  Let's go with the gut.
[06:37.300 --> 06:38.320]  Sonic is the guess.
[06:38.640 --> 06:43.020]  Sonic is the least popular iconic video game character.
[06:43.320 --> 06:47.960]  You guys still have to figure out the second and third least popular.
[06:48.220 --> 06:48.500]  Okay.
[06:49.220 --> 06:50.020]  Oh, dude.
[06:50.120 --> 06:51.980]  Do we go with...
[06:51.980 --> 06:52.840]  Do you think Doomguy?
[06:53.880 --> 06:55.960]  No, I'm thinking more like Pikachu.
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.800]  Oh, Pikachu's interesting.
[06:58.700 --> 07:00.780]  Do you think they go with Zelda or Link?
[07:01.200 --> 07:02.520]  Oh, interesting.
[07:03.580 --> 07:05.680]  They probably do a Minecraft thing.
[07:05.940 --> 07:09.280]  And I don't know who any of those characters are, so I can't go with that.
[07:12.120 --> 07:14.080]  Shit, it's much more complicated on this.
[07:14.940 --> 07:18.220]  That's why I was thinking about passing, but you're jumping on play real quick.
[07:18.420 --> 07:19.420]  So I say go for it.
[07:19.640 --> 07:20.100]  I can't believe you played.
[07:20.160 --> 07:20.700]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:21.660 --> 07:25.700]  I felt like Mario and Sonic were like locks and then the rest are like, I don't know, man.
[07:25.980 --> 07:26.320]  Fascinating.
[07:26.720 --> 07:27.060]  Anywhere.
[07:27.900 --> 07:30.660]  I guess we'll just go, like, you want to go with like, you go with Link?
[07:31.180 --> 07:31.660]  Let's do Link.
[07:31.840 --> 07:34.100]  All right. I don't think he's on the list, but we're going to give it a shot.
[07:34.100 --> 07:35.960]  Link is the guess.
[07:37.200 --> 07:42.120]  Link is the third most popular pick by our audience.
[07:42.700 --> 07:43.180]  Wow.
[07:43.340 --> 07:43.660]  All right.
[07:44.440 --> 07:47.920]  One left. You're missing one to sweep the category.
[07:48.060 --> 07:51.780]  What if Gavin said Link 2? Would you give him the win in the whole thing?
[07:51.820 --> 07:52.760]  Because it's just one more.
[07:53.020 --> 07:56.280]  I would give it to him if he said Link 117, but not Link 2.
[07:58.140 --> 08:00.520]  Boy, I want to go with something like Pikachu.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.640]  Less popular than Link, but more popular than Sonic.
[08:03.640 --> 08:07.240]  Yeah, but Sonic being at the bottom of that list is really weird to me.
[08:07.460 --> 08:09.660]  Like, I feel like Sonic would be much higher.
[08:10.100 --> 08:14.400]  I just, I feel like he hasn't been represented as well in the last, this last generation.
[08:14.840 --> 08:18.180]  No, but he had the one game with like the comeback and his, his fans,
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.400]  Sonic fans are freaks, dude.
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.580]  Like, hey, they keep drawing his feet and like sucking his toes and going nuts.
[08:23.780 --> 08:24.380]  Like, it's not good.
[08:24.540 --> 08:26.540]  He did have the two movies, I guess, as well.
[08:26.660 --> 08:26.820]  Yeah.
[08:27.180 --> 08:28.140]  Oh, then it's got to be Pikachu.
[08:28.400 --> 08:30.580]  It has to be Pikachu because he did this.
[08:30.640 --> 08:33.040]  He did this, the movie with Ryan Reynolds, right?
[08:33.640 --> 08:34.440]  Yeah, he did.
[08:35.020 --> 08:35.540]  Do Pikachu.
[08:35.840 --> 08:38.260]  Pikachu is the guess.
[08:39.080 --> 08:41.220]  Pikachu is the correct answer.
[08:41.820 --> 08:49.360]  Nick and Eric sweep the first round 15 points to none.
[08:49.920 --> 08:50.760]  I don't, I gotta be honest.
[08:50.840 --> 08:52.100]  I don't think I would have, we would have got there.
[08:52.560 --> 08:53.280]  No, I don't think so either.
[08:53.360 --> 08:55.000]  Nah, I wouldn't have put Pikachu.
[08:55.380 --> 08:55.980]  I wouldn't have either.
[08:56.280 --> 08:57.000]  Who would you have picked?
[08:57.060 --> 08:58.220]  Who do you guys think you would have picked?
[08:58.560 --> 09:00.820]  I think Steve, but you didn't know his name.
[09:01.120 --> 09:02.040]  Steve from Minecraft, maybe?
[09:02.040 --> 09:03.320]  Yeah, maybe Steve.
[09:04.200 --> 09:05.540]  Oh, Minecraft Steve.
[09:05.860 --> 09:07.820]  Do you think even like retro, like Pac-Man?
[09:08.280 --> 09:09.860]  Oh yeah, I was thinking Kirby for a second.
[09:10.620 --> 09:11.480]  Moving on.
[09:11.960 --> 09:12.400]  Luigi.
[09:13.240 --> 09:14.420]  To the next decider.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.040]  Who's playing this?
[09:16.520 --> 09:17.260]  I guess it's me and Eric.
[09:17.700 --> 09:18.080]  Yeah, sure.
[09:18.160 --> 09:18.480]  No, straight.
[09:18.720 --> 09:23.720]  Jeff and Eric, if you combine the Rotten Tomatoes scores of John Cena's first four films that have
[09:23.720 --> 09:26.060]  reviews, what is the combined number?
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.360]  Are we slacking it to you?
[09:30.660 --> 09:31.520]  Yeah, just slack it to me.
[09:31.520 --> 09:32.060]  Great.
[09:33.120 --> 09:33.640]  Okay.
[09:34.220 --> 09:34.920]  Uh-huh.
[09:38.080 --> 09:39.100]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[09:40.040 --> 09:42.920]  I've received guesses by both parties.
[09:43.540 --> 09:44.680]  Eric has guessed 80.
[09:45.080 --> 09:45.300]  Yeah.
[09:46.560 --> 09:48.940]  Jeff has guessed 74.
[09:52.400 --> 09:56.140]  I'm going to read you what the movies are and the percentages.
[09:56.540 --> 09:57.460]  Then we gotta do math.
[09:57.760 --> 09:59.400]  No, I have the number already written.
[09:59.480 --> 10:00.640]  I'm just going to read it to build suspense.
[10:01.130 --> 10:03.760]  His first film, The Marine, 17%.
[10:04.380 --> 10:04.780]  Yeah.
[10:04.980 --> 10:08.080]  The next one with reviews, 12 rounds, 31%.
[10:08.760 --> 10:13.360]  The next one with reviews, Fred the Movie, 0%.
[10:14.160 --> 10:14.560]  Yeah!
[10:14.820 --> 10:15.400]  Oh, shit!
[10:16.260 --> 10:20.220]  His next one is called Legendary, 20%.
[10:21.030 --> 10:25.160]  And the last is The Reunion, 8%.
[10:25.730 --> 10:27.640]  Which comes to a total of 76.
[10:28.300 --> 10:30.340]  Jeff, you have won the round.
[10:30.340 --> 10:32.400]  But that was incredibly close.
[10:32.540 --> 10:33.380]  Yeah, that was really great.
[10:33.580 --> 10:33.720]  Wow.
[10:34.180 --> 10:34.900]  Holy shit.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.680]  Jeff won within two, Eric lost within four.
[10:37.840 --> 10:38.560]  Like, that was...
[10:38.560 --> 10:41.440]  You're doing a cheap number, but that was genuinely a great guess.
[10:41.660 --> 10:43.180]  I really thought Jeff was going to say 81.
[10:43.900 --> 10:45.040]  I was expecting the same.
[10:45.620 --> 10:48.040]  Next question, what's the best Rockstar game?
[10:48.700 --> 10:49.060]  Wow.
[10:49.180 --> 10:50.080]  Jeff, what do you like to play?
[10:50.860 --> 10:51.580]  Oh, shit!
[10:51.780 --> 10:52.540]  What do you think, Gav?
[10:52.560 --> 10:53.140]  Do we want to play?
[10:55.360 --> 10:57.080]  Um, I mean, there's not a ton, right?
[10:57.480 --> 10:57.840]  Right.
[10:58.500 --> 10:59.140]  There's quite a few.
[10:59.140 --> 10:59.960]  Oh, cool.
[11:00.000 --> 11:00.460]  Thanks, Andrew.
[11:01.200 --> 11:01.480]  Pass?
[11:02.620 --> 11:03.640]  Okay, let's pass.
[11:03.660 --> 11:04.600]  What is this?
[11:04.840 --> 11:05.160]  Protest.
[11:06.100 --> 11:06.540]  Protest.
[11:07.300 --> 11:08.180]  Under protest.
[11:08.720 --> 11:09.000]  Protest.
[11:10.020 --> 11:10.400]  Ridiculous.
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.620]  That's not a helpful suggestion.
[11:13.240 --> 11:14.900]  Well, I was going to play and then I...
[11:14.900 --> 11:16.940]  There's obviously a lot of Rockstar games.
[11:17.320 --> 11:18.120]  Oh, my God.
[11:18.500 --> 11:19.760]  I thought there were not that many.
[11:19.820 --> 11:20.840]  And then you said there were a lot.
[11:20.940 --> 11:21.760]  So I said pass.
[11:22.020 --> 11:25.400]  I still think people only care about a select few.
[11:25.560 --> 11:27.580]  But I'm happy passing on this.
[11:27.620 --> 11:28.220]  It's passed.
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.820]  It is going to Nick and Eric.
[11:31.380 --> 11:31.700]  Protest.
[11:31.880 --> 11:32.400]  All right, Eric.
[11:32.600 --> 11:33.280]  We can do this.
[11:33.740 --> 11:34.800]  You guys did so good last time.
[11:35.180 --> 11:37.460]  GTA V is the number five answer.
[11:37.960 --> 11:39.460]  Are V and Online the same game?
[11:39.920 --> 11:40.280]  Yes.
[11:40.840 --> 11:44.200]  Okay, then GTA V is just responded in at V and let's move on.
[11:44.520 --> 11:46.020]  GTA V is the number one answer.
[11:47.020 --> 11:47.600]  Red Dead 2 next.
[11:47.820 --> 11:49.460]  Yeah, Red Dead 2 is definitely next.
[11:50.040 --> 11:51.760]  Red Dead 2 is next?
[11:51.980 --> 11:52.360]  Go ahead.
[11:52.540 --> 11:52.680]  Yeah.
[11:52.920 --> 11:54.460]  And then, Nick, Red Dead 1?
[11:54.480 --> 11:54.920]  Red Dead.
[11:55.040 --> 11:55.680]  Yeah, Red Dead 1.
[11:57.460 --> 12:01.240]  Now, Red Dead 1 is the second least.
[12:01.480 --> 12:02.000]  Oh, wow.
[12:02.400 --> 12:04.680]  Okay, so is it 4 or Vice City?
[12:04.780 --> 12:05.940]  Because they're both on the list.
[12:06.060 --> 12:07.080]  But which one do you think is higher?
[12:07.560 --> 12:08.200]  Vice City is higher.
[12:08.300 --> 12:09.200]  Okay, so Vice City.
[12:09.480 --> 12:10.980]  Which Red Dead is Red Dead 1?
[12:11.560 --> 12:12.760]  Red Dead Redemption.
[12:13.440 --> 12:14.240]  Not Revolver.
[12:14.380 --> 12:15.000]  Write that then.
[12:15.040 --> 12:15.780]  Not Revolver.
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.400]  Oh, yeah, it could be Revolver.
[12:17.780 --> 12:17.880]  Yeah.
[12:17.960 --> 12:19.400]  You can protest too if you want to, Gavin.
[12:19.960 --> 12:21.120]  Halo 3 ODST.
[12:23.340 --> 12:28.080]  Halo 3 ODST 117 Red Dead Redemption.
[12:31.660 --> 12:33.620]  All right, Vice City.
[12:33.780 --> 12:34.400]  Vice City.
[12:34.520 --> 12:37.300]  Vice City is not on the list.
[12:37.420 --> 12:38.580]  You get your first X.
[12:38.960 --> 12:39.520]  Oh, really?
[12:39.720 --> 12:39.960]  You're wrong.
[12:40.440 --> 12:40.940]  Oh, wow.
[12:41.220 --> 12:42.540]  Okay, so GTA 4.
[12:43.060 --> 12:44.760]  GTA 4, you're locking in that?
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.000]  Yeah, let's do it.
[12:46.120 --> 12:46.320]  Yes.
[12:46.480 --> 12:50.260]  Okay, GTA 4 is the least popular.
[12:50.740 --> 12:51.780]  You're missing one.
[12:52.140 --> 12:53.500]  You think Bully is going to be number three?
[12:53.640 --> 12:55.920]  No, I don't think it's going to be that high, do you?
[12:56.240 --> 12:57.120]  I don't know.
[12:57.120 --> 12:59.440]  I think it's got to be San Andreas if it's going to be one of them.
[13:00.100 --> 13:02.360]  Unless you think it's something like Max Payne 3,
[13:02.520 --> 13:05.540]  but I just don't think that many people are going to answer Max Payne 3.
[13:06.100 --> 13:06.520]  Table tennis.
[13:06.720 --> 13:07.220]  People are going to, yeah.
[13:08.260 --> 13:10.480]  What's the fucking, what's the car one?
[13:10.740 --> 13:12.060]  Midnight Club Racing.
[13:12.060 --> 13:12.600]  Club.
[13:17.100 --> 13:22.100]  Are the DLCs separate or are they part of the thing?
[13:22.140 --> 13:23.220]  No, part of the thing.
[13:23.540 --> 13:23.640]  Okay.
[13:25.820 --> 13:29.140]  I think it's got to be San Andreas, man, I don't know.
[13:29.280 --> 13:32.020]  Yeah, I'd lean towards San Andreas, although 3 was really good.
[13:32.240 --> 13:35.460]  Yeah, but I just don't know age-wise if that's where it's going to land.
[13:36.100 --> 13:37.000]  Let's do San Andreas.
[13:37.540 --> 13:38.240]  GTA London.
[13:38.940 --> 13:39.740]  San Andreas.
[13:40.760 --> 13:41.820]  Was there a guess?
[13:42.200 --> 13:42.680]  Yeah, go ahead.
[13:43.200 --> 13:45.200]  San Andreas is not the right answer.
[13:45.380 --> 13:46.940]  That's two Xs.
[13:47.320 --> 13:47.680]  Wow.
[13:48.220 --> 13:50.280]  You have one more attempt to figure out.
[13:50.460 --> 13:52.460]  What are the Xs denoted on this?
[13:52.700 --> 13:53.140]  Yeah, that's good.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.460]  That's actually a really good question, Gavin.
[13:56.580 --> 13:59.100]  I kind of want to, because I forgot we had one, Andrew.
[13:59.620 --> 14:00.180]  Oh, you did?
[14:00.280 --> 14:02.240]  Okay, well, you know, there you go.
[14:02.320 --> 14:02.600]  X, X.
[14:02.620 --> 14:03.900]  Why would you do that?
[14:03.920 --> 14:04.820]  That looks like our score.
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.880]  Yeah, oh, you wanted it?
[14:06.940 --> 14:07.400]  There it is.
[14:08.240 --> 14:09.420]  Doesn't make any sense if you ask me.
[14:10.140 --> 14:11.680]  Do you want to go with Bully, then?
[14:12.160 --> 14:13.940]  I was thinking that, but what about LA Noire?
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.880]  No, I don't think so.
[14:16.380 --> 14:21.600]  I think Bully is the weird loved one that, like, people want the sequel to so bad,
[14:21.660 --> 14:23.380]  and then they're going to get it and go, I don't want to play this.
[14:23.880 --> 14:24.740]  Did they make Manhunt?
[14:25.280 --> 14:28.240]  Yeah, but I don't know that that's going to be on this list.
[14:28.920 --> 14:29.420]  I think we just...
[14:29.420 --> 14:29.940]  Alright, fuck it, let's do Bully.
[14:30.000 --> 14:30.560]  Let's go with Bully.
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.260]  Let's go with Bully.
[14:31.680 --> 14:32.480]  People love that game.
[14:32.680 --> 14:33.860]  Their guess is Bully.
[14:34.140 --> 14:34.880]  I love Bully.
[14:35.060 --> 14:35.500]  I liked it.
[14:35.520 --> 14:36.100]  I thought it was fine.
[14:36.560 --> 14:37.160]  Never played it.
[14:37.400 --> 14:37.840]  Oh, really?
[14:37.840 --> 14:39.380]  Bully is the correct answer.
[14:40.060 --> 14:41.660]  Ahead of Red Dead Redemption.
[14:42.160 --> 14:42.880]  That's insane.
[14:43.720 --> 14:44.640]  That's Bully.
[14:45.040 --> 14:47.470]  People are remembering that game more fondly than...
[14:48.280 --> 14:49.620]  A hundred percent.
[14:49.700 --> 14:52.580]  They like that better than GTA Vice City?
[14:52.840 --> 14:53.000]  Yeah.
[14:53.500 --> 14:55.260]  And San Andreas?
[14:55.760 --> 14:57.300]  Yeah, like, they don't know that...
[14:57.300 --> 14:57.940]  And 4?
[14:58.500 --> 15:00.400]  Yeah, the fact that they're getting, like, left behind.
[15:00.500 --> 15:02.320]  They like it more than Red Dead Redemption 1.
[15:02.780 --> 15:03.400]  That's insane.
[15:03.740 --> 15:03.880]  That's nuts.
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.700]  Dude, the fucking Lost in the Damned and Ballad of Gay Tony are, like, some of the best video
[15:08.700 --> 15:10.040]  game content ever made.
[15:10.620 --> 15:12.120]  Ballad of Gay Tony is amazing.
[15:12.500 --> 15:15.100]  Hey, The Warriors is better than Bully.
[15:15.360 --> 15:16.040]  Great game.
[15:17.800 --> 15:23.240]  After two rounds of this game, Team Nick and Eric, leading by 30.
[15:23.580 --> 15:25.300]  I don't think it was called Bully in England.
[15:25.760 --> 15:26.520]  What was it called?
[15:26.820 --> 15:27.300]  Like...
[15:27.300 --> 15:27.840]  I don't remember.
[15:27.920 --> 15:29.640]  I think it had some, like, Latin name.
[15:29.920 --> 15:30.860]  It was Skooled-o.
[15:31.220 --> 15:31.460]  What?
[15:32.320 --> 15:33.340]  It was what?
[15:34.120 --> 15:36.280]  Like, Clue is called Cluedo.
[15:36.620 --> 15:37.460]  Skooled-o?
[15:38.380 --> 15:40.440]  I believe it was Bully 117.
[15:40.700 --> 15:46.180]  Let's move to the next decider category, which will be between Gavin and Nick.
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.340]  How much money, domestically, did the highest grossing film released in the summer of 98 make?
[15:52.840 --> 15:53.280]  Oh, first.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.460]  Oh my god.
[15:54.940 --> 15:55.540]  Bucks.
[15:55.840 --> 15:56.180]  Eight.
[15:57.200 --> 15:57.800]  Domestically.
[15:58.100 --> 15:58.400]  98.
[15:58.580 --> 15:59.060]  Domestically.
[15:59.900 --> 16:01.380]  That's a crazy one.
[16:01.480 --> 16:03.380]  I'm very bad at money.
[16:03.380 --> 16:04.840]  Yeah, that's fine.
[16:04.920 --> 16:05.040]  Yeah.
[16:05.240 --> 16:06.000]  I trust you.
[16:06.640 --> 16:06.960]  Well...
[16:06.960 --> 16:08.860]  Also, also, this is all under protest, so it doesn't matter.
[16:09.140 --> 16:09.700]  Yeah, you're right.
[16:09.740 --> 16:10.080]  You know what?
[16:10.340 --> 16:10.620]  Exactly.
[16:10.680 --> 16:11.520]  That's what you have to do.
[16:11.600 --> 16:16.160]  Release yourself from doubt and just know that this is all under protest, so it doesn't matter.
[16:16.540 --> 16:20.600]  When they submit me their guesses, we will advance.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.640]  I wanted that Slack message to pop up so bad just now.
[16:28.120 --> 16:30.400]  I don't, I don't, I seriously have no idea about this.
[16:30.540 --> 16:31.400]  You just pick one, man.
[16:31.980 --> 16:32.820]  It makes sense.
[16:32.960 --> 16:33.200]  I did.
[16:33.200 --> 16:34.760]  It's okay.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.840]  It's probably not good.
[16:36.520 --> 16:37.140]  Well, you was...
[16:40.680 --> 16:42.160]  We did a whole movie draft.
[16:42.720 --> 16:43.200]  300.
[16:43.660 --> 16:46.420]  So the film, I now have the answers for both people.
[16:46.660 --> 16:48.380]  Film is Saving Private Ryan.
[16:48.960 --> 16:49.980]  Is one of the answers 300?
[16:51.760 --> 16:52.980]  Oh, what happened?
[16:53.940 --> 16:54.240]  What?
[16:56.580 --> 16:57.400]  Did it pop up?
[16:57.980 --> 17:00.060]  No, you said it out loud.
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.940]  You said it when I typed it.
[17:02.160 --> 17:02.800]  You said it out loud.
[17:02.800 --> 17:04.360]  You said 300.
[17:04.660 --> 17:08.820]  You said the words 300 out loud.
[17:08.880 --> 17:09.800]  I don't remember that.
[17:10.340 --> 17:13.620]  How, Andrew, Andrew, how else would I have known to say that?
[17:14.300 --> 17:17.600]  That is, that is why I was baffled, Eric.
[17:17.760 --> 17:22.380]  I was, because it popped up on my screen and I just had zero awareness that I'd verbally,
[17:22.960 --> 17:23.860]  vocally said it.
[17:24.120 --> 17:25.580]  I was like, how did he...
[17:25.580 --> 17:28.400]  So it doesn't matter if we hide the Slack messages.
[17:28.600 --> 17:30.260]  You're just going to say them.
[17:30.560 --> 17:31.520]  I didn't even hear it.
[17:31.600 --> 17:31.920]  Fuck.
[17:31.920 --> 17:35.600]  So if I type something to you right now, do you just say it?
[17:37.320 --> 17:38.840]  Uh, nope, nope.
[17:39.600 --> 17:42.900]  Gavin guessed, Gavin guessed 300.
[17:43.260 --> 17:43.700]  Oh yeah?
[17:44.020 --> 17:44.820]  No, you don't say it.
[17:46.220 --> 17:49.440]  Nick guessed 90 million.
[17:50.280 --> 17:51.640]  More power than that, Nick.
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.980]  The correct answer is 216,540,000 dollars.
[17:58.900 --> 18:00.440]  Jeff and Gavin win.
[18:00.840 --> 18:01.100]  Ow.
[18:01.220 --> 18:01.640]  Hell yeah.
[18:01.640 --> 18:02.500]  Your round.
[18:02.880 --> 18:05.520]  Oh, we're not doing like, oh, like closest without going over?
[18:05.940 --> 18:08.200]  No, it's just whoever's closest is not under.
[18:08.520 --> 18:10.140]  Wow, that's some bullshit.
[18:10.580 --> 18:13.680]  Yeah, that sounds like a made up rule all of a sudden.
[18:13.760 --> 18:14.880]  It's under, it's all under protest.
[18:14.960 --> 18:15.520]  It doesn't matter.
[18:15.840 --> 18:17.120]  Best gaming system.
[18:17.680 --> 18:18.700]  Oh, there's a lot of these.
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.040]  Doesn't have to be console.
[18:20.140 --> 18:21.700]  Could be anything that you play games on.
[18:22.100 --> 18:23.200]  Oh, we got to play this one, right?
[18:23.320 --> 18:23.960]  Let's do it.
[18:24.420 --> 18:25.380]  All right, all right.
[18:25.460 --> 18:30.540]  Jeff and Gavin are playing best gaming system.
[18:32.100 --> 18:33.500]  I sent Andrew a message.
[18:33.640 --> 18:34.740]  I want to see you write it out loud.
[18:34.940 --> 18:35.980]  We're going to ruin this.
[18:36.760 --> 18:38.760]  Should we go with a personal computer?
[18:38.860 --> 18:40.020]  Gavin would be the first one.
[18:40.500 --> 18:41.380]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[18:41.560 --> 18:43.120]  Well, I would say a PS2.
[18:44.500 --> 18:45.320]  Let's do that.
[18:47.500 --> 18:48.860]  PS2 is their guess.
[18:49.500 --> 18:52.140]  PS2 is the number two answer.
[18:53.680 --> 18:54.120]  PS2.
[18:54.340 --> 18:56.880]  Gavin with no confidence in Jeff's answer.
[18:57.940 --> 19:00.240]  I was just discussing both things we thought of.
[19:00.260 --> 19:01.040]  Let's go with Jeff's.
[19:02.160 --> 19:02.840]  OK.
[19:03.500 --> 19:08.060]  I'd somehow less enthusiastically like to say personal computer.
[19:09.500 --> 19:15.320]  Jeff less enthusiastically says PC is the number four second most popular answer.
[19:15.760 --> 19:16.060]  PC.
[19:16.980 --> 19:19.000]  Now, how with Xbox?
[19:19.700 --> 19:21.540]  How is it just going to be?
[19:21.540 --> 19:22.320]  Is it even going to be on there?
[19:22.740 --> 19:24.220]  Well, I don't know.
[19:24.560 --> 19:25.420]  And which Nintendo?
[19:26.200 --> 19:27.680]  Would people put the Game Boy?
[19:28.600 --> 19:31.020]  No, no.
[19:31.480 --> 19:31.680]  No.
[19:32.020 --> 19:33.280]  But will the Switch be on there?
[19:34.120 --> 19:36.260]  Oh, I wish we hadn't done this.
[19:37.800 --> 19:39.780]  Yeah, there's a lot of different...
[19:39.780 --> 19:41.700]  Are you talking about this question or the whole game show?
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.760]  PS5, I would say, probably is up there, right?
[19:46.020 --> 19:46.780]  Wouldn't you think?
[19:47.280 --> 19:48.040]  I feel good, Eric.
[19:48.400 --> 19:49.120]  The Footrest?
[19:49.340 --> 19:50.540]  You think it's one of the best games?
[19:51.120 --> 19:52.740]  I think it's very popular.
[19:53.480 --> 19:54.120]  It's the hot.
[19:54.220 --> 19:55.860]  It's the it's the hot one right now.
[19:55.900 --> 19:56.600]  All the kids are into.
[19:57.640 --> 19:58.520]  Go for it.
[20:00.080 --> 20:01.120]  No, I...
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.200]  No, you go.
[20:02.320 --> 20:03.440]  Super Nintendo, would that be on there?
[20:03.740 --> 20:04.440]  How old is...
[20:04.440 --> 20:05.580]  Gavin said Super Nintendo.
[20:05.960 --> 20:06.940]  It's like, put it on the board!
[20:08.180 --> 20:10.040]  Their guess is Super Nintendo.
[20:11.020 --> 20:15.860]  Super Nintendo is not one of the consoles or machines.
[20:16.380 --> 20:17.980]  Gavin, do you call it a SNES?
[20:18.580 --> 20:19.260]  Yeah, SNES.
[20:20.160 --> 20:20.680]  Weird.
[20:21.200 --> 20:21.720]  1X.
[20:22.140 --> 20:23.640]  All right, well, I'm going to go with PS5.
[20:24.440 --> 20:24.700]  Go for it.
[20:24.880 --> 20:25.360]  Jaguar.
[20:26.080 --> 20:28.040]  Jeff is saying PS5.
[20:29.140 --> 20:30.780]  PS5 is the least popular.
[20:30.940 --> 20:31.780]  Correct answer.
[20:31.960 --> 20:32.720]  That's good.
[20:33.260 --> 20:33.540]  What?
[20:33.580 --> 20:34.760]  That's under PS2?
[20:34.840 --> 20:36.040]  Get the fuck out of here.
[20:36.660 --> 20:37.840]  Nick is outraged.
[20:38.020 --> 20:39.020]  Audience is angered, Nick.
[20:39.460 --> 20:41.500]  I mean, PS5 should not be on this list.
[20:41.720 --> 20:42.140]  Yeah, probably.
[20:42.780 --> 20:43.780]  PS2 shouldn't be on this list.
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.640]  What the fuck was on that?
[20:44.640 --> 20:46.520]  PS2 is like the best selling console of all time.
[20:46.840 --> 20:48.600]  Yeah, but all the games on it suck.
[20:48.780 --> 20:49.960]  It's just banger after...
[20:49.960 --> 20:52.440]  Remember all those games that we listed in the best of Rockstar 1?
[20:55.360 --> 20:57.580]  It is probably the most...
[20:57.580 --> 20:59.860]  Maybe not the most, but one of the most beloved consoles.
[21:00.060 --> 21:01.900]  And I love... Nick has zero love for it.
[21:02.200 --> 21:06.000]  No, I got it for Christmas one year and I fucking hated all the games.
[21:06.760 --> 21:07.240]  What?
[21:07.700 --> 21:07.980]  What?
[21:08.040 --> 21:09.920]  You just hated gaming for like a year.
[21:09.920 --> 21:10.720]  On the PS2?
[21:11.060 --> 21:12.820]  That's like thousands of games.
[21:12.860 --> 21:14.260]  It came with Arbor Core 2.
[21:14.440 --> 21:15.180]  I fucking hated it.
[21:16.500 --> 21:19.360]  What an insane game to judge the console by.
[21:19.720 --> 21:22.420]  Yeah, that's all trash after that.
[21:22.760 --> 21:23.300]  I'm a kid.
[21:23.300 --> 21:27.160]  So am I going to surprise you with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[21:27.380 --> 21:27.820]  Probably.
[21:28.140 --> 21:31.660]  But can you get up to 40% off back to school essentials on Uber Eats?
[21:31.840 --> 21:32.320]  Definitely.
[21:32.880 --> 21:35.820]  So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40% off.
[21:36.000 --> 21:37.540]  Exclusions may apply. Check app for availability.
[21:39.420 --> 21:45.660]  Vitamin Water Zero Sugar has great taste, zero BS, and obviously zero sugar.
[21:45.900 --> 21:50.260]  For those with zero room in their calendar, zero patience for slow walkers.
[21:50.260 --> 21:54.760]  Those who get zero hours of sleep on a Saturday night.
[21:56.300 --> 22:02.620]  Have zero filter, zero f***s given, and zero interest in grabbing a plane, boring water.
[22:03.320 --> 22:06.340]  Grab a delicious Vitamin Water Zero Sugar today.
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.380]  Raise the rudders! Raise the sails! Raise the sails!
[22:12.600 --> 22:15.520]  Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching. Over.
[22:15.960 --> 22:19.900]  Roger. Wait, is that an Enterprise sails solution?
[22:20.540 --> 22:23.660]  Reach sales professionals, not professional sailors.

[22:38.100 --> 22:41.660]  If Nintendo's represented, Gavin, do you think it's going to be the 64
[22:42.660 --> 22:47.140]  or the Switch? It wouldn't be the Wii, right? Like, nobody really liked the Wii.
[22:47.540 --> 22:49.760]  GameCube was the Wii that wasn't big enough.
[22:51.800 --> 22:53.480]  GameCube. NES, I guess.
[22:53.940 --> 22:56.940]  This all seems pretty recent, though. Should we just go Switch?
[22:59.080 --> 23:05.000]  Switch! Switch is their guess. Switch is incorrect. That is your second X.
[23:07.560 --> 23:10.340]  No Switch, but PS5.
[23:10.800 --> 23:14.940]  And PS2. I'm going to say N64. If PS2's on there, N64's got to be on there, right?
[23:15.360 --> 23:16.380]  More than PS1?
[23:19.660 --> 23:23.140]  Okay, I'm going to let you make the last pick. I just, I don't know.
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.220]  No, no, no, no. I've been wrong twice. I've been wrong twice. Let's go with yours.
[23:27.620 --> 23:33.840]  I just, look, two PlayStations are already on there. I feel like the PS2 might cannibalize
[23:33.840 --> 23:36.700]  the PS1. There's got to be. I don't think Xbox is going to be there.
[23:37.200 --> 23:39.960]  I'm going to say, all right, I'm going to go, I'm going to say N64.
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.200]  Okay.
[23:48.300 --> 23:50.340]  Jeff's guess is N64.
[23:53.620 --> 24:01.080]  It's not on there. Three X's. It goes to Team Nick and Eric with the chance to steal.
[24:01.500 --> 24:02.980]  I failed you, Gavin. I'm so sorry.
[24:03.460 --> 24:04.120]  Hey, no worries.
[24:04.540 --> 24:06.020]  It's got to be Xbox 360, right, Nick?
[24:06.260 --> 24:07.760]  Not a question. 360.
[24:08.320 --> 24:14.760]  Xbox 360 is their guess. Xbox 360 is the most popular answer.
[24:15.320 --> 24:18.140]  Jeff, know your audience.
[24:19.080 --> 24:23.840]  I've been being told the Xbox sucks my entire professional career by my audience.
[24:24.140 --> 24:31.680]  Xbox 360 was like the only Xbox console I respect. It was unstoppable. Unstoppable.
[24:32.140 --> 24:36.540]  I have like four friends that loved Xbox and everybody else just dumped on us
[24:36.540 --> 24:38.960]  for the fucking all day, every day.
[24:39.220 --> 24:43.120]  Yeah, I just thought Xbox was supremely unpopular compared to PlayStation.
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.060]  I mean, you think about the history of Let's Play and...
[24:47.060 --> 24:49.980]  Xbox 360 won that generation, man. It destroyed.
[24:50.440 --> 24:51.460]  It destroyed.
[24:51.800 --> 24:53.680]  I mean, online multiplayer was insane.
[24:53.820 --> 24:55.780]  Yeah, crushed. Crushed, crushed, crushed.
[24:56.540 --> 25:03.280]  And to Nick, most of all, it wasn't a PS2. The missing answer to this question was the...
[25:03.280 --> 25:05.620]  Wait, not for points, but can I guess?
[25:05.700 --> 25:06.340]  Yeah, go ahead.
[25:06.680 --> 25:07.540]  Is it GameCube?
[25:07.840 --> 25:10.660]  It is not. There were zero Nintendo consoles.
[25:11.200 --> 25:12.280]  Is it PS4 then?
[25:12.280 --> 25:13.880]  It is not PS4.
[25:14.080 --> 25:15.480]  It's the original PlayStation, right?
[25:15.760 --> 25:16.760]  It's not PS1.
[25:17.360 --> 25:20.540]  Nobody was going to fill out this board, apparently, regardless of what side it went.
[25:20.880 --> 25:23.460]  The missing answer is the original Xbox.
[25:23.960 --> 25:24.880]  Oh, what?
[25:25.180 --> 25:26.920]  Come on, no one bought that.
[25:27.300 --> 25:29.100]  That was just me that had one of those.
[25:29.520 --> 25:30.680]  I had one of those.
[25:30.880 --> 25:32.800]  Even I didn't like the original Xbox.
[25:33.240 --> 25:35.180]  If I retract everything I said, these people are nuts.
[25:35.640 --> 25:36.740]  They had a hard drive in it though.
[25:37.360 --> 25:38.960]  I had so many blocks I could save.
[25:40.900 --> 25:42.120]  That's true, you devil.
[25:42.340 --> 25:43.980]  We did have the option to save blocks.
[25:44.180 --> 25:45.740]  The worst controller.
[25:45.980 --> 25:46.240]  What that meant.
[25:46.540 --> 25:48.120]  The worst controller.
[25:48.520 --> 25:49.060]  The Duke.
[25:49.060 --> 25:50.700]  No, the N64 is so much worse.
[25:50.720 --> 25:50.900]  No.
[25:51.320 --> 25:53.520]  Wait, you think the original Xbox is the worst controller?
[25:53.740 --> 25:54.660]  No way, the Duke?
[25:54.780 --> 25:55.360]  You're an idiot.
[25:55.640 --> 25:56.100]  I hate it.
[25:56.100 --> 25:56.860]  You're an idiot.
[25:57.180 --> 25:57.960]  I hate it.
[25:57.980 --> 26:00.300]  The size of it, I hated it.
[26:00.540 --> 26:01.020]  I hated it.
[26:01.160 --> 26:03.240]  The original PlayStation DualShock is the worst.
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.300]  That's a flimsy dog shit controller too.
[26:06.480 --> 26:07.960]  That's a totally fine controller.
[26:07.960 --> 26:10.580]  How's that worse than the one that didn't have the analog stick?
[26:10.880 --> 26:11.400]  They both suck.
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.000]  He's got you there.
[26:12.140 --> 26:12.680]  It's true.
[26:12.980 --> 26:13.840]  Next question.
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.360]  Two things can suck at the same time.
[26:15.980 --> 26:16.160]  Yeah.
[26:16.580 --> 26:17.980]  This is Jeff and Eric.
[26:18.360 --> 26:21.400]  How many career homers did Billy Ripken hit?
[26:21.940 --> 26:23.520]  Oh, okay.
[26:24.520 --> 26:25.480]  Let me...
[26:25.480 --> 26:26.300]  Are we slacking you?
[26:26.420 --> 26:28.160]  Slack you that answer, I guess.
[26:28.600 --> 26:31.140]  You two can slack me when you feel you have an answer.
[26:33.300 --> 26:35.640]  I have a feeling I know what Eric's is.
[26:35.640 --> 26:39.320]  No, I'm not going to do the funniest thing of all time.
[26:39.420 --> 26:40.500]  That is crazy.
[26:42.720 --> 26:44.100]  I gave you a real answer.
[26:44.500 --> 26:45.520]  Okay, I went.
[26:45.660 --> 26:45.920]  I went.
[26:46.000 --> 26:46.360]  I did it.
[26:46.440 --> 26:47.060]  I sent it.
[26:47.180 --> 26:48.120]  Okay, I got two.
[26:49.000 --> 26:50.660]  I got three messages.
[26:51.440 --> 26:53.300]  Okay, two of them related to the...
[26:53.300 --> 26:54.220]  What's the other one say?
[26:55.120 --> 26:55.480]  Grapes.
[26:56.300 --> 26:57.220]  That was from Gavin.
[26:57.580 --> 26:58.300]  Gavin sent me grapes.
[26:58.760 --> 26:59.980]  I'm just trying to be confusing.
[27:00.700 --> 27:01.860]  We went to...
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.280]  We went to two opposite sides of this.
[27:05.280 --> 27:07.700]  We went a big number and a low number.
[27:09.100 --> 27:11.840]  Jeff guessed 186.
[27:12.060 --> 27:13.420]  You're insane.
[27:14.840 --> 27:17.280]  Eric guessed 22.
[27:19.100 --> 27:22.260]  The correct answer is 20.
[27:22.680 --> 27:23.840]  Yeah, Eric wins.
[27:24.520 --> 27:26.300]  No way it was more than 40.
[27:26.480 --> 27:29.340]  I thought about like his career.
[27:29.700 --> 27:32.840]  He's a bass hit guy, I guess.
[27:33.560 --> 27:34.900]  Zero power.
[27:35.280 --> 27:35.960]  For a hitter.
[27:36.200 --> 27:36.560]  Nuts.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.360]  Well, I only know him because he wrote f***face on his back.
[27:41.800 --> 27:43.600]  That leads us to the question.
[27:44.720 --> 27:46.300]  What's your favorite color?
[27:46.800 --> 27:48.560]  This is the dumbest f***ing game.
[27:48.800 --> 27:49.620]  This is so dumb.
[27:51.080 --> 27:54.240]  This is submitted obviously by our community.
[27:54.600 --> 27:56.180]  All the regulation listeners, comment leavers.
[27:56.240 --> 27:57.060]  I guess they'd be comment leavers.
[27:57.420 --> 27:59.960]  Yeah, we should pass on this, right?
[28:00.220 --> 28:02.000]  Punk that s*** in the second half, baby.
[28:02.020 --> 28:02.960]  Yeah, yeah, we're gonna pass.
[28:03.020 --> 28:03.740]  We're gonna give it to them.
[28:03.740 --> 28:06.580]  Nick and Eric are passing to Jeff and Gavin.
[28:07.160 --> 28:09.340]  What is our community's favorite color?
[28:10.440 --> 28:10.880]  Okay.
[28:13.800 --> 28:15.420]  That is the correct response.
[28:15.640 --> 28:15.880]  Blue.
[28:18.900 --> 28:20.460]  Jeff is guessing blue.
[28:21.850 --> 28:22.980]  Oh my god.
[28:23.380 --> 28:24.680]  Blue is the number one answer.
[28:26.460 --> 28:27.480]  That's awesome.
[28:27.720 --> 28:29.520]  Gav, you got any guesses?
[28:34.740 --> 28:35.480]  Green.
[28:37.020 --> 28:39.280]  Green is Gavin's guess.
[28:39.860 --> 28:43.000]  Green is the second most popular answer.
[28:45.340 --> 28:46.620]  Run the board, guys.
[28:46.880 --> 28:47.340]  Run the board.
[28:47.440 --> 28:47.980]  Get them in order.
[28:49.940 --> 28:50.940]  Three available.
[28:51.780 --> 28:53.280]  So far, you two are in sequence.
[28:54.100 --> 28:54.600]  Red.
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.840]  Jeff is guessing red.
[29:00.140 --> 29:01.680]  Why do people listen to this?
[29:02.120 --> 29:02.620]  Red.
[29:02.940 --> 29:04.440]  We're just guessing colors.
[29:05.020 --> 29:07.080]  We gotta think about the audience and what they feel.
[29:07.220 --> 29:08.000]  What's in their hearts.
[29:08.280 --> 29:09.940]  And red is in their heart.
[29:10.940 --> 29:12.620]  The number two spot.
[29:12.940 --> 29:13.640]  Oh, damn.
[29:14.200 --> 29:14.380]  Red.
[29:16.400 --> 29:18.000]  You're missing two.
[29:18.540 --> 29:19.480]  Three and one.
[29:20.020 --> 29:21.060]  You're missing three or two.
[29:23.540 --> 29:24.720]  You're up, Gav.
[29:25.280 --> 29:26.840]  I mean, you don't need to rotate.
[29:27.160 --> 29:27.640]  You can...
[29:27.640 --> 29:29.000]  Someone has color confidence.
[29:29.760 --> 29:31.880]  I don't think a lot of people like yellow.
[29:32.540 --> 29:33.240]  Would that be on there?
[29:33.720 --> 29:36.220]  Well, you gotta think of all the piss rats in the chat.
[29:37.080 --> 29:38.240]  There's a lot of piss rats.
[29:38.920 --> 29:39.620]  Yellow is just...
[29:40.320 --> 29:41.440]  It's kind of minging, right?
[29:41.980 --> 29:42.420]  Bit of minging.
[29:43.180 --> 29:44.340]  You think people would say orange?
[29:44.820 --> 29:46.680]  Or is that too obscure of a color?
[29:47.080 --> 29:49.020]  And then do we get into gold and stuff?
[29:49.100 --> 29:49.920]  Like, is that a different color?
[29:50.240 --> 29:51.800]  What about white and black?
[29:51.880 --> 29:52.800]  Are they even colors?
[29:53.440 --> 29:54.220]  Are we all...
[29:54.220 --> 29:55.100]  They wouldn't be...
[29:55.100 --> 29:55.920]  Are they...
[29:55.920 --> 29:56.760]  Well, black isn't.
[29:56.880 --> 29:58.640]  White is everything, right?
[29:58.880 --> 29:59.220]  Yeah.
[29:59.540 --> 30:01.060]  Well, if it's paint, it's black, I suppose.
[30:01.060 --> 30:03.340]  Just to help you a little bit with this.
[30:03.520 --> 30:04.860]  Oh, that's good, man.
[30:04.920 --> 30:05.820]  I'm so glad you're helping.
[30:06.020 --> 30:07.560]  Not helping, just explaining.
[30:07.880 --> 30:09.360]  This would be the exact same clarification.
[30:10.360 --> 30:13.940]  This is a survey in which people inputted whatever they wanted to.
[30:14.460 --> 30:19.880]  So if you think that something isn't a color, but they might think it is, you could guess that.
[30:20.360 --> 30:21.200]  Cadmium yellow.
[30:21.940 --> 30:22.800]  Oh, God.
[30:23.180 --> 30:24.140]  Is that your guess?
[30:24.460 --> 30:24.800]  No.
[30:26.480 --> 30:27.700]  Just wanted to make sure.
[30:28.320 --> 30:29.760]  They could put anything in.
[30:29.860 --> 30:30.800]  Real good so far.
[30:31.060 --> 30:36.320]  So that means what Andrew's telling us there is the black or white is on there.
[30:36.460 --> 30:38.580]  Yeah, they definitely pick black, right?
[30:38.760 --> 30:40.480]  Yeah, dude. Thanks for helping, Andrew. That's so cool.
[30:40.820 --> 30:41.700]  But he wasn't helping.
[30:42.020 --> 30:44.320]  Uh-huh, right. He used the word, but I agree, yeah.
[30:44.740 --> 30:45.560]  Is that your guess, black?
[30:47.820 --> 30:48.980]  Is that your official guess?
[30:49.620 --> 30:50.340]  I think it should be.
[30:51.360 --> 30:51.820]  Yeah, why not?
[30:52.420 --> 30:55.720]  Black is the guess. Black is not on the board.
[30:55.960 --> 30:56.220]  Okay.
[30:56.940 --> 30:58.240]  Interesting. All right.
[30:58.320 --> 30:59.580]  Maybe he was anti-helping.
[31:00.100 --> 31:00.460]  Protest.
[31:00.460 --> 31:02.920]  I was just clarifying how these were submitted.
[31:03.400 --> 31:06.440]  You think people say purple? That's my daughter's favorite color.
[31:06.940 --> 31:08.900]  People could have typed gurple.
[31:09.300 --> 31:09.780]  Oh.
[31:11.180 --> 31:11.600]  Oh.
[31:12.500 --> 31:13.720]  Only one way to find out.
[31:14.180 --> 31:15.100]  Yeah, go, go, go.
[31:17.000 --> 31:17.880]  I wonder if...
[31:17.880 --> 31:21.660]  I mean, if we asked regulation listeners what their favorite color is,
[31:21.980 --> 31:24.640]  how many of them would have been funny enough to write gurple?
[31:24.840 --> 31:25.860]  Hopefully enough.
[31:26.360 --> 31:29.700]  The question is, do we go for gurple before we go to purple?
[31:32.020 --> 31:33.540]  What was the poll number, Andrew?
[31:34.020 --> 31:35.760]  Sorry, what was the question, Nick?
[31:36.100 --> 31:37.300]  What was the poll number? How many people?
[31:37.840 --> 31:39.340]  I don't have that information.
[31:39.560 --> 31:39.860]  Thousands.
[31:40.720 --> 31:41.160]  Thousands?
[31:41.940 --> 31:42.240]  Thousands.
[31:42.980 --> 31:43.300]  Shit.
[31:44.840 --> 31:46.800]  I mean, we got to be funny, right?
[31:47.320 --> 31:49.820]  At some point in this video, somebody's got to be funny.
[31:50.100 --> 31:50.780]  Let's go with gurple.
[31:51.920 --> 31:54.660]  Gurple is their guess. Gurple is incorrect.
[31:55.000 --> 31:55.920]  Not even mad.
[31:56.620 --> 31:58.440]  Actually, I am mad. I'm disappointed in the audience.
[32:00.520 --> 32:02.820]  Well, I'm not mad at me, I'm mad at you.
[32:03.020 --> 32:03.860]  Really let us down.
[32:04.500 --> 32:06.060]  No black, no gurple.
[32:06.960 --> 32:07.320]  Pink?
[32:07.860 --> 32:08.040]  Nah.
[32:09.500 --> 32:11.920]  Are we scared off of purple now? I feel like we are.
[32:12.800 --> 32:15.080]  Yellow's still got to be in the mix. It is a primary color.
[32:16.320 --> 32:17.360]  Yeah. Do we want a yellow?
[32:18.040 --> 32:21.880]  I mean, I'm gonna let you pick because I picked gurple and look what it got us.
[32:22.560 --> 32:24.520]  Also black. I picked black. Jesus Christ.
[32:25.220 --> 32:25.740]  Uh...
[32:29.160 --> 32:32.540]  Okay, Jeff, does your gut say purple, white, or yellow?
[32:33.620 --> 32:35.500]  My gut says yellow.
[32:36.040 --> 32:36.540]  Yellow!
[32:37.620 --> 32:38.820]  That just makes me pick it.
[32:41.860 --> 32:43.360]  Yellow is their guess.
[32:44.320 --> 32:49.520]  Yellow is not on the board. That is three X's. It goes to team Nick and Eric.
[32:49.760 --> 32:50.620]  Son of a bitch.
[32:51.220 --> 32:52.800]  Hey, Gav, you don't have to worry about it.
[32:52.800 --> 32:55.320]  This episode's under protest. That doesn't even count.
[32:55.460 --> 32:58.480]  Yeah, I'm telling you. See, now you guys are getting it. Now you guys are finally
[32:58.480 --> 32:59.700]  understanding what I'm laying down.
[33:00.060 --> 33:03.040]  We're not actually. We're still up one to nothing. This one doesn't count.
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.660]  Nick and Eric, what is a favorite color?
[33:06.000 --> 33:12.780]  Well, here's the thing. Nick, I think that orange being up there is probably pretty good,
[33:12.960 --> 33:17.420]  but white feels like it might be on the list. But if black's not, then maybe it's not.
[33:18.040 --> 33:19.220]  Gut feeling, what do you think?
[33:19.820 --> 33:20.940]  I think orange is going to be on there.
[33:21.000 --> 33:22.780]  You think so? All right, let's go with orange. Let's see what happens.
[33:22.800 --> 33:29.000]  Orange, which is Jeff's favorite color, is on the list. It's the least popular.
[33:29.160 --> 33:32.520]  Nick and Eric steal with orange.
[33:33.040 --> 33:33.520]  Protest.
[33:34.100 --> 33:37.040]  Yeah, no, that's fine. Yeah, no, I agree. Protest. Yeah, absolutely.
[33:38.300 --> 33:41.240]  Any guesses as to what the missing color would be?
[33:41.500 --> 33:42.220]  Orange is a good color.
[33:42.920 --> 33:43.500]  I think it's teal.
[33:44.060 --> 33:46.520]  Nick thinks teal. Eric says white. Neither are correct.
[33:47.040 --> 33:50.420]  The missing correct answer, purple.
[33:50.420 --> 33:51.980]  Oh, my God.
[33:55.320 --> 33:55.880]  Shit.
[33:57.340 --> 33:57.900]  Shit.
[33:59.020 --> 34:00.340]  Well, well, well.
[34:02.640 --> 34:06.580]  Can't believe they didn't do gerpal.
[34:06.880 --> 34:10.760]  To put purple and not put gerpal and listen to this show is wild.
[34:11.500 --> 34:13.040]  I can't believe Jeff didn't listen to Gavin.
[34:13.640 --> 34:16.320]  Gerpal was submitted 210 times.
[34:16.460 --> 34:16.960]  Wow.
[34:17.160 --> 34:19.360]  Not enough to make the list.
[34:20.300 --> 34:21.000]  Make the list.
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.920]  210 are the real heroes, though.
[34:22.940 --> 34:23.620]  Yep, absolutely.
[34:24.220 --> 34:25.540]  210 funny fans.
[34:26.140 --> 34:28.940]  We should use those 210 people for something.
[34:30.620 --> 34:31.620]  The next few.
[34:31.640 --> 34:33.800]  I want the next few to be only those people.
[34:35.280 --> 34:38.820]  Only the gerpalist of comment leavers.
[34:39.460 --> 34:42.440]  Moving into the final decider.
[34:44.040 --> 34:49.080]  How many separate attempts has Flavor Flav made to launch a chain of chicken restaurants?
[34:49.360 --> 34:49.880]  All right, Nick, this is you.
[34:51.540 --> 34:56.720]  Now, to clarify the question, this isn't how many restaurants has he had at one time.
[34:57.120 --> 35:01.780]  This is how many starting over, starting from scratch attempts.
[35:02.260 --> 35:03.060]  Like with a new name.
[35:03.580 --> 35:10.360]  Yeah, either a new variation of a name or or just all of the previous ones got shut down.
[35:10.500 --> 35:11.880]  And there's a long period of time.
[35:12.120 --> 35:13.540]  And then he started one again.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  Is this me doing this one?
[35:15.360 --> 35:17.260]  It is Nick and Gavin.
[35:17.920 --> 35:18.540]  Oh, dear.
[35:19.280 --> 35:20.000]  I already put mine.
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.040]  Nick has already submitted his.
[35:22.800 --> 35:23.120]  Locked in.
[35:23.860 --> 35:29.380]  I am so glad that Gavin submitted what he did.
[35:30.180 --> 35:30.740]  Damn.
[35:31.540 --> 35:33.700]  Because I have no other deciders lined up.
[35:34.060 --> 35:36.480]  And Nick wins it with five.
[35:36.940 --> 35:38.280]  Gavin guessed eight.
[35:38.880 --> 35:40.340]  The correct answer is four.
[35:40.760 --> 35:41.460]  Oh, wow.
[35:42.020 --> 35:44.340]  Separate attempts to figure it out.
[35:44.460 --> 35:46.000]  So, Nick, you won that one.
[35:46.100 --> 35:46.300]  Hell yeah.
[35:46.500 --> 35:47.120]  Final round.
[35:47.260 --> 35:47.860]  Final question.
[35:48.640 --> 35:49.660]  What's the best cereal?
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.500]  We have to pass.
[35:52.820 --> 35:53.920]  Go ahead, guys.
[35:54.520 --> 35:55.080]  Run the board.
[35:55.340 --> 35:55.940]  We'll just pass.
[35:56.080 --> 35:56.860]  We'll just pass back.
[35:57.140 --> 35:58.320]  No, no passbacks.
[35:59.440 --> 36:01.640]  We couldn't possibly accept.
[36:01.760 --> 36:04.480]  Geoff and Gavin taking on cereal.
[36:04.920 --> 36:05.800]  Oh, Christ.
[36:06.080 --> 36:07.580]  You're going to be no help here.
[36:08.100 --> 36:10.140]  I've never bought cereal in this country.
[36:10.500 --> 36:11.940]  No, you never bought Squeezles?
[36:13.200 --> 36:16.280]  I'm going to guess Lucky Charms is up there.
[36:17.040 --> 36:19.120]  Lucky Charms is a guess by Geoff.
[36:19.120 --> 36:20.960]  And it is on the board.
[36:21.140 --> 36:23.080]  It is the third answer.
[36:23.540 --> 36:24.920]  Was this an international poll?
[36:25.860 --> 36:29.940]  Anyone who... I tweeted it out, I believe, and I think I posted it on the Patreon.
[36:30.760 --> 36:32.580]  So anyone could have answered.
[36:32.980 --> 36:34.660]  Cheerios are big in your country, right, Geoff?
[36:35.020 --> 36:35.760]  Oh, yeah.
[36:36.140 --> 36:37.040]  They're big in America, too.
[36:37.140 --> 36:38.080]  They're boring, but they're big.
[36:38.180 --> 36:39.460]  Maybe you should do Cheerios.
[36:39.960 --> 36:40.460]  Which kind?
[36:40.820 --> 36:41.800]  Just fucking Cheerios.
[36:42.640 --> 36:45.000]  Base Cheerios is their guess.
[36:45.620 --> 36:46.480]  It is not on the list.
[36:46.560 --> 36:47.460]  That's your first X.
[36:48.180 --> 36:49.640]  Probably Honey Nut Cheerios.
[36:50.600 --> 36:52.320]  Yeah, we don't have base Cheerios.
[36:52.840 --> 36:55.080]  That probably would have been helpful for Geoff to know.
[36:55.600 --> 36:57.240]  We had a whole conversation about it on the podcast.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.920]  We got like multigrain, but not the...
[36:59.920 --> 37:01.500]  Listen, I didn't remember that conversation.
[37:02.000 --> 37:02.180]  Oh.
[37:02.560 --> 37:04.020]  I remembered that we had a conversation.
[37:04.160 --> 37:05.580]  I didn't remember the guts of it.
[37:06.420 --> 37:07.500]  You want to go Honey Nut Cheerios?
[37:08.180 --> 37:09.080]  Fuck it, why not?
[37:09.660 --> 37:10.080]  Yeah.
[37:10.640 --> 37:13.960]  Honey Nut Cheerios is their second guess, continuing on the Cheerio train.
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.080]  Cheerio train, so far, has no coal.
[37:17.240 --> 37:18.640]  That is your second X.
[37:18.940 --> 37:19.800]  How can we know that?
[37:20.920 --> 37:21.680]  They know it.
[37:22.000 --> 37:22.480]  It's in their soul.
[37:22.480 --> 37:23.900]  No, I want to see it visually represented.
[37:23.900 --> 37:24.080]  Actually, wait.
[37:24.560 --> 37:26.420]  Yeah, I do know how I can represent this.
[37:26.560 --> 37:26.700]  Okay.
[37:27.160 --> 37:28.800]  How do people feel about Frosties?
[37:29.680 --> 37:30.420]  Frosted Flakes?
[37:30.880 --> 37:31.080]  Yeah.
[37:31.280 --> 37:31.880]  I'm fine with it.
[37:31.880 --> 37:32.360]  Let's do that.
[37:32.500 --> 37:33.240]  They're great.
[37:33.980 --> 37:37.560]  Gavin has never bought cereal in this country, but he knows what the people like.
[37:37.820 --> 37:41.380]  Frosted Flakes, the fourth correct answer.
[37:42.120 --> 37:43.320]  Frosties is a way better name.
[37:43.320 --> 37:44.200]  It is.
[37:44.580 --> 37:45.800]  Is that what it's called?
[37:46.480 --> 37:46.860]  Yeah.
[37:47.540 --> 37:54.000]  Just going off popularity on shelves, I feel like Fruit Loops has got to be way up there,
[37:54.420 --> 37:56.480]  even though I'm not a huge fan myself.
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.760]  Captain Crunch, he's pretty high up on the list, I would think.
[38:03.840 --> 38:06.340]  Those are the cereals I've heard about on television.
[38:06.900 --> 38:07.320]  Okay.
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.080]  How about Fruit Loops?
[38:10.840 --> 38:12.800]  Geoff's guess is Fruit Loops.
[38:13.300 --> 38:14.560]  Fruit Loops is not on the board.
[38:14.640 --> 38:16.780]  Nick, you have a chance to steal.
[38:17.360 --> 38:19.260]  Are we going with Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Nick?
[38:19.960 --> 38:20.480]  I think so.
[38:20.600 --> 38:20.700]  Okay.
[38:20.780 --> 38:21.340]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[38:21.780 --> 38:25.580]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is their guess, and they get the number one answer.
[38:27.060 --> 38:28.300]  Stealing those points.
[38:30.140 --> 38:30.420]  Yeah, absolutely.
[38:30.740 --> 38:31.080]  Yeah, whatever.
[38:31.340 --> 38:31.960]  Yeah, 100%, dude.
[38:32.200 --> 38:33.320]  I don't like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
[38:34.060 --> 38:34.500]  Winners.
[38:34.800 --> 38:35.740]  Cinnamon Toast, hold on.
[38:35.860 --> 38:36.360]  It's too much.
[38:36.460 --> 38:37.460]  It's trying too hard.
[38:38.540 --> 38:39.720]  French Toast Crunch is better.
[38:39.720 --> 38:40.700]  Team Nick and Eric.
[38:40.820 --> 38:41.900]  Losers, Team Gigi.
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.060]  That puts the series at 1-1.
[38:44.200 --> 38:45.580]  Makes it 0-0, but it's fine.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.040]  We will be back next time.
[38:48.460 --> 38:48.780]  We won't.
[38:48.780 --> 38:49.500]  Well, that's not the end.
[38:49.580 --> 38:50.580]  I mean, you got to listen.
[38:50.660 --> 38:52.900]  Check out our Patreon Regulation Pod.
[38:53.400 --> 38:54.880]  We got gameplays.
[38:55.280 --> 38:56.580]  Check out Regulatrion.com.
[38:56.640 --> 38:56.860]  It's good.
[38:57.340 --> 38:57.840]  It's great.
[38:58.020 --> 38:59.180]  Cinnamon Toast Crunch is delicious.
[38:59.420 --> 39:00.720]  Thank you so much for listening.
[39:01.180 --> 39:05.320]  We will be back with the final game between these head-to-head matchups.
[39:05.960 --> 39:06.440]  Join us then.
[39:06.900 --> 39:07.300]  Goodbye.
[39:07.960 --> 39:08.700]  Bowl of sugar.
[39:08.700 --> 39:09.560]  Protest.
[39:10.640 --> 39:12.060]  Welcome to the protest series.
[39:12.440 --> 39:13.160]  Tail sink!
[39:13.440 --> 39:14.560]  Was Captain Crunch on?
[39:15.520 --> 39:16.100]  Oh, shit.
[39:16.100 --> 39:16.700]  Yeah, you're right.
[39:17.440 --> 39:18.340]  I didn't even fill out the board.
[39:18.840 --> 39:21.240]  The least popular, Captain Crunch.
[39:22.700 --> 39:24.980]  Second least popular, Fruity Pebbles.
[39:28.700 --> 39:30.400]  Good for Fruity Pebbles.
[39:30.960 --> 39:32.920]  Good for Fruity Pebbles.
[39:32.980 --> 39:34.160]  The chocolate ones are better, but yeah.
[39:34.240 --> 39:34.520]  I agree.
[39:34.920 --> 39:35.200]  Five.
[39:35.200 --> 39:37.760]  The inconsistent capitalization is doing my nut.
[39:37.760 --> 39:38.780]  Cap three.
[39:39.700 --> 39:41.380]  Jeff, stop that right now.
[39:41.480 --> 39:42.160]  You're going to throw me off.
[39:43.080 --> 39:44.160]  All right, tail sink.
[39:44.340 --> 39:44.700]  Bye.
