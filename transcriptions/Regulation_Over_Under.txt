[00:36.640 --> 00:40.260]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[00:40.860 --> 00:47.060]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream, making s'mores with the kids,
[00:47.340 --> 00:49.860]  while a national park is our backdrop.
[00:50.540 --> 00:54.120]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot.

[01:00.100 --> 01:05.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a new game that I thought about while I was mowing my yard.
[01:05.540 --> 01:07.860]  We call it Regulation Over Under.
[01:08.340 --> 01:12.820]  And we're using a website called More or Less to find these different games.
[01:13.000 --> 01:16.520]  This is something that we're going to give a shot at. A brand new half-thought-out game
[01:16.520 --> 01:21.280]  where we're just going to play some over-under, see how the longest streak we can get is as a team.
[01:21.280 --> 01:23.340]  Maybe we take some cracks at it individually.
[01:23.620 --> 01:28.360]  But the thing that got me thinking was we have the summer movie stuff coming out.
[01:28.500 --> 01:37.300]  We really have to hone in on movie money, the power of film internationally,
[01:37.800 --> 01:42.060]  and whether these movies are going to be shown internationally or not.
[01:42.200 --> 01:44.900]  But this is worldwide gross of movies.
[01:45.320 --> 01:49.620]  How much they earned with this movie.
[01:49.620 --> 01:52.320]  Proof your knowledge here. Are you guys ready to proof your knowledge?
[01:52.420 --> 01:54.520]  I am so ready to proof it.
[01:54.760 --> 01:59.660]  Can I just say in advance, I'm going to be very confidently wrong about a lot of stuff in this video.
[02:00.100 --> 02:03.840]  That to me is really exciting. That to me is very, very exciting.
[02:03.840 --> 02:08.920]  Because I think it's really going to sort of shade what we're about to get into with the summer movie draft again.
[02:09.220 --> 02:12.860]  Now, our first one, and over-under is a pretty easy concept.
[02:12.920 --> 02:18.620]  It's going to give us a number, and we're going to say did it make more or less, essentially, than what number is given.
[02:18.620 --> 02:22.120]  Man of Steel, 2013, which is... who made that?
[02:22.580 --> 02:23.160]  Zack Snyder.
[02:23.500 --> 02:29.200]  Zack Snyder movie. $668 million worldwide gross.
[02:30.600 --> 02:33.480]  Twilight, 2008. What do you think? More or less?
[02:33.740 --> 02:37.380]  I think the true question for all of these is, which movie did better in China?
[02:37.880 --> 02:41.600]  That's what I was about to say. China, big market. China loves baseball.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.700]  Twilight has a baseball scene. Man of Steel, no baseball.
[02:45.020 --> 02:45.360]  No baseball.
[02:45.360 --> 02:45.680]  That's true.
[02:45.980 --> 02:46.940]  So that's a thing to consider.
[02:46.940 --> 02:49.740]  I don't think the first Twilight movie has the baseball scene, does it?
[02:49.900 --> 02:50.360]  Yes, it does.
[02:50.700 --> 02:52.800]  Is that the one it's in?
[02:53.600 --> 02:56.220]  They blow their load in the first one with the baseball scene?
[02:56.400 --> 02:58.940]  And they never go back to it. It's such a shame.
[02:59.660 --> 03:01.220]  Four following movies, no baseball.
[03:01.640 --> 03:03.180]  Isn't it set to that Muse song?
[03:03.640 --> 03:04.060]  It is.
[03:05.300 --> 03:06.100]  That's awesome.
[03:06.520 --> 03:10.360]  Do you think Superman could hit a baseball from one continent to another?
[03:10.840 --> 03:11.300]  Oh, yeah.
[03:11.920 --> 03:15.280]  Without trying. I think he could hit it to another planet.
[03:15.280 --> 03:21.320]  But much like the Twilight Vampires, he can only play during thunderstorms, so it covers up how hard he's hitting the ball.
[03:21.620 --> 03:26.480]  It's true. It's true. And he wears an old-timey baseball hat and he does a big leg kick.
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.820]  You know what's nuts about Superman movies is there's still rockets and stuff.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.060]  There's still people building rockets to the moon. Just hire Superman to pick up the rocket and put it on the moon.
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.300]  I thought you were going to say pick up the astronaut and just fly them to the moon.
[03:41.380 --> 03:42.100]  Just get them over there.
[03:42.120 --> 03:42.660]  Take me! Take me!
[03:44.360 --> 03:46.540]  Okay, so what do you think? Twilight, more or less?
[03:47.060 --> 03:50.600]  I would say less, but I'm trained that these are all going to be gotchas.
[03:51.100 --> 03:57.880]  So it's like it's fighting my brain going, well, no, I mean, obviously it has to be more because why else would they put this here?
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.560]  Yeah, I would have thought more.
[03:59.960 --> 04:00.680]  I would go less.
[04:01.040 --> 04:01.820]  I'd go more.
[04:02.340 --> 04:02.920]  Wow, really?
[04:03.080 --> 04:03.640]  I think so.
[04:03.720 --> 04:05.420]  Okay, well, Twilight was huge.
[04:05.880 --> 04:08.860]  If it was only huge in America, it's an American story.
[04:09.380 --> 04:09.620]  Yeah.
[04:09.620 --> 04:14.740]  But superheroes, like you got Man of Steel came out during a time of like peak Marvel.
[04:15.140 --> 04:17.400]  People are excited about superhero films.
[04:18.120 --> 04:19.640]  There's a feeling of importance.
[04:19.880 --> 04:22.620]  Michael Shan... Michael Shannon! Come on!
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.500]  Everybody loves Michael Shannon.
[04:24.840 --> 04:26.240]  Gets his neck snapped!
[04:26.940 --> 04:28.460]  Well, spoilers. Jesus Christ.
[04:28.860 --> 04:30.220]  Oh, sorry. Maybe Superman then.
[04:30.860 --> 04:33.280]  Is that Man of Steel the one where he does that?
[04:33.560 --> 04:33.860]  Yes.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.260]  That Michael Shannon's in?
[04:35.400 --> 04:35.640]  Oh, yeah.
[04:35.660 --> 04:36.540]  What was the one before that?
[04:36.700 --> 04:37.400]  It wasn't.
[04:37.460 --> 04:38.400]  That was the first one.
[04:38.400 --> 04:41.220]  Superman Returns, I guess, would be the one before that.
[04:41.420 --> 04:42.340]  Oh, wow. Okay.
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.780]  So, are we saying Twilight less than or more?
[04:45.040 --> 04:45.300]  Less.
[04:46.120 --> 04:46.240]  More?
[04:47.200 --> 04:47.640]  Boy.
[04:48.780 --> 04:49.400]  This is hard.
[04:49.540 --> 04:50.860]  I love this. This is the first one.
[04:50.980 --> 04:52.080]  This is the first one.
[04:52.400 --> 04:53.640]  My gut instinct is less.
[04:54.040 --> 04:55.240]  All right, I'll go with Andrew's gut.
[04:55.560 --> 04:57.000]  Okay. All right, here we go.
[04:58.340 --> 04:58.780]  Twilight...
[04:58.780 --> 04:59.260]  Oh!
[05:00.240 --> 05:01.020]  408 million.
[05:01.180 --> 05:02.980]  So, our streak right now is one.
[05:03.140 --> 05:04.460]  We're doing great.
[05:05.420 --> 05:13.320]  Worldwide gross of Twilight, 2008, 408 million versus Cats from 2019.
[05:13.820 --> 05:14.760]  It's got to be less.
[05:14.900 --> 05:15.460]  It's got to be less.
[05:15.460 --> 05:16.000]  It has to be.
[05:16.800 --> 05:18.840]  Everybody thought it was going to be shit from the beginning.
[05:19.200 --> 05:19.960]  It's got to be less.
[05:20.180 --> 05:21.000]  They patched it.
[05:21.300 --> 05:23.180]  It could have been like an international hit.
[05:23.580 --> 05:28.020]  People may have seen it, but the US side, I feel like, would be so low.
[05:28.340 --> 05:29.320]  They patched the buttholes.
[05:29.860 --> 05:30.940]  Yeah, they patched the buttholes.
[05:31.420 --> 05:33.780]  Let's go less. Let's do less.
[05:33.780 --> 05:34.460]  Let's go less.
[05:34.600 --> 05:35.340]  Yeah, I don't think it's...
[05:35.340 --> 05:35.660]  Go less.
[05:36.660 --> 05:37.860]  Oh, way less.
[05:39.540 --> 05:40.380]  73 million.
[05:40.460 --> 05:41.300]  Oh, wow, dude.
[05:41.780 --> 05:43.060]  Now, this one might be pretty easy.
[05:43.200 --> 05:43.560]  This is more.
[05:43.760 --> 05:49.200]  But this puts us in an interesting spot because Cats, 2019, it's 73 million.
[05:49.660 --> 05:51.920]  Or Rogue One, a Star Wars story.
[05:52.060 --> 05:53.360]  Didn't realize that was its whole title.
[05:53.560 --> 05:53.680]  Yep.
[05:53.780 --> 05:54.380]  From 2016.
[05:55.180 --> 05:56.000]  Definitely more.
[05:56.000 --> 05:56.120]  It has to be more.
[05:56.280 --> 05:57.120]  It has to be.
[05:57.120 --> 05:59.540]  It has the best scene of all of the Star Wars.
[05:59.880 --> 06:00.060]  Yes.
[06:00.300 --> 06:02.800]  Which I didn't get was the best scene of the Star...
[06:02.800 --> 06:04.180]  You're referring to the Vader thing?
[06:04.720 --> 06:04.840]  Yeah.
[06:05.180 --> 06:07.740]  Yeah, the Vader is velociraptor scene.
[06:08.120 --> 06:09.100]  I didn't watch the original.
[06:09.320 --> 06:09.980]  This was...
[06:09.980 --> 06:11.540]  I haven't seen the original movies.
[06:11.760 --> 06:14.420]  I've only seen Rogue One and the prequels.
[06:15.020 --> 06:21.300]  And so when Vader did that, I just assumed that's what Vader did in all the movies from the reputation of Vader.
[06:21.460 --> 06:21.980]  Oh, my God.
[06:21.980 --> 06:26.000]  So, like, the significance of, like, how cool that was completely missed.
[06:26.100 --> 06:27.320]  I mean, I'm just like, this is what he does.
[06:27.320 --> 06:34.600]  Yeah, in some movies, Vader, he, like, lumbers around and he gets told off in a conference room and then, like, chokes someone a little bit.
[06:35.080 --> 06:36.540]  He chokes someone mentally.
[06:36.960 --> 06:39.220]  And before that, he lifts a dude up by the lapels.
[06:39.440 --> 06:39.960]  And that's it.
[06:40.220 --> 06:43.160]  Well, then I feel like his rep really wasn't earned going into Rogue One.
[06:43.620 --> 06:48.400]  Well, no, he was... he was just, like, he's a tough, badass, like, scary guy.
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.900]  And it didn't have to be seen in that way.
[06:50.980 --> 06:55.500]  That's why the... that's why that moment was so cool because we finally got to see it that way.
[06:55.500 --> 07:00.840]  Also, you only seeing this in the prequels is saying, like, I've only seen Solo in the cartoon.
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.900]  Like, you're... that's insane.
[07:03.260 --> 07:05.380]  I've seen the Christmas special as well.
[07:05.440 --> 07:06.640]  Okay, all right, all right.
[07:06.960 --> 07:08.640]  So, Rogue One is more.
[07:09.220 --> 07:10.580]  Will it be ten times more?
[07:10.840 --> 07:12.160]  Oh, my God.
[07:12.220 --> 07:12.300]  Significantly.
[07:12.860 --> 07:14.340]  A billion dollars.
[07:15.120 --> 07:18.080]  Less, less, less, less, less, less, less, less.
[07:18.080 --> 07:20.020]  Rogue One, a Star Wars story.
[07:20.380 --> 07:26.820]  One billion dollars versus The Invisible Man from 2020 starring Elizabeth Moss, I think.
[07:27.040 --> 07:28.800]  Also the year of COVID, by the way.
[07:29.120 --> 07:30.980]  It reviewed very well. Haven't seen it.
[07:31.360 --> 07:31.660]  Okay.
[07:32.060 --> 07:33.460]  Gavin, what do you think? More or less?
[07:33.740 --> 07:34.500]  Definitely less.
[07:34.960 --> 07:35.220]  Okay.
[07:35.280 --> 07:35.840]  Definitely less.
[07:36.440 --> 07:38.340]  Oh, 122. Okay.
[07:38.560 --> 07:40.100]  Ooh, kids movies more.
[07:40.360 --> 07:41.820]  Yeah, it's gotta be.
[07:42.080 --> 07:43.200]  It's gotta be more.
[07:43.200 --> 07:48.140]  And what we're talking about, Invisible Man 2020 versus Monsters University 2013.
[07:48.520 --> 07:49.060]  Didn't like it.
[07:49.120 --> 07:54.200]  We're saying Monsters University is more than 122 million and...
[07:55.040 --> 07:56.540]  It's opening weekend is way more.
[07:56.740 --> 07:57.520]  It's way more.
[07:57.920 --> 07:58.020]  Yeah.
[07:58.260 --> 07:59.260]  Holy shit.
[07:59.280 --> 07:59.640]  Less.
[08:00.840 --> 08:01.640]  $743 million.
[08:03.740 --> 08:04.540]  So, now...
[08:04.540 --> 08:06.160]  This was the Oscar winner, wasn't it?
[08:06.300 --> 08:06.520]  Yeah.
[08:06.700 --> 08:07.480]  Or it wasn't?
[08:07.720 --> 08:09.180]  It was either that or La La Land, right?
[08:09.340 --> 08:10.140]  Oh, that was it, yeah.
[08:10.460 --> 08:11.560]  It was one of the two.
[08:11.560 --> 08:15.000]  So, I would love for a movie to be...
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.960]  The gay, black movie that is incredible and so heartfelt.
[08:19.180 --> 08:22.260]  I would love for that to make more than Monsters University.
[08:22.520 --> 08:23.200]  There's no way.
[08:23.480 --> 08:26.100]  I feel like this is based on you not knowing what Moonlight is.
[08:26.700 --> 08:26.980]  Yeah.
[08:27.580 --> 08:27.760]  Yeah.
[08:28.980 --> 08:31.700]  I saw Moonlight in theaters with two other people.
[08:31.820 --> 08:32.900]  I'm gonna say less.
[08:33.360 --> 08:34.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[08:34.580 --> 08:40.360]  I like that you're trying to meta the game when truly it looks like it's just a random pull.
[08:40.360 --> 08:41.140]  Okay.
[08:41.620 --> 08:42.440]  Moonlight, less.
[08:42.940 --> 08:44.060]  It's gonna be so much less.
[08:44.200 --> 08:44.460]  Oh, wow.
[08:44.540 --> 08:45.260]  Good for Moonlight.
[08:45.620 --> 08:46.320]  $65 million.
[08:46.700 --> 08:48.540]  That's more than I would've thought Moonlight would've done.
[08:48.700 --> 08:49.160]  That's great.
[08:50.340 --> 08:50.740]  Now...
[08:50.740 --> 08:52.480]  Oh, Saw IV.
[08:53.280 --> 08:54.860]  Moonlight was $65 million.
[08:55.080 --> 08:56.220]  Or Saw IV.
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.440]  See, now here's where...
[08:57.440 --> 08:58.300]  Now, it's like...
[08:58.300 --> 09:00.220]  It has to be more, doesn't it?
[09:00.260 --> 09:00.660]  It has to be more.
[09:00.660 --> 09:01.260]  It has to be more.
[09:01.320 --> 09:04.040]  Because the third one was the best one in a lot of people's eyes.
[09:04.320 --> 09:06.700]  I think it's only gonna be like $120 million.
[09:06.920 --> 09:09.300]  I don't think it's gonna be like $700 million, right?
[09:09.740 --> 09:10.160]  No.
[09:10.540 --> 09:10.880]  No.
[09:11.160 --> 09:12.620]  Because these movies are so cheap.
[09:12.960 --> 09:13.220]  Yeah.
[09:13.500 --> 09:14.280]  Okay, let's see.
[09:15.160 --> 09:16.700]  Worldwide gross for Saw IV.
[09:16.940 --> 09:17.680]  We're saying more.
[09:17.900 --> 09:18.160]  Yeah.
[09:19.160 --> 09:19.580]  Yeah.
[09:20.480 --> 09:21.180]  $139 million.
[09:21.660 --> 09:21.980]  Oh.
[09:22.360 --> 09:22.780]  Ooh.
[09:23.700 --> 09:25.700]  Toy Story, $19.95.
[09:26.340 --> 09:26.560]  Less?
[09:26.560 --> 09:27.580]  No, more, more, more, more, more.
[09:27.600 --> 09:28.300]  No, no, no, no, no.
[09:28.300 --> 09:28.480]  More.
[09:28.620 --> 09:29.840]  Why did you say less?
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.740]  My brain reversed it and I was thinking, well, Saw is less than Toy Story.
[09:33.820 --> 09:34.200]  It's more than Toy Story.
[09:34.200 --> 09:34.520]  Oh, okay.
[09:35.180 --> 09:38.940]  I was like taking in a big deep breath to kick off and then you said, oh, no, more.
[09:38.940 --> 09:39.520]  Yeah, no.
[09:39.720 --> 09:40.000]  Uh-huh.
[09:40.280 --> 09:40.660]  Uh-huh.
[09:40.860 --> 09:41.420]  Uh, okay.
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.520]  Definitely more.
[09:42.760 --> 09:46.200]  I bet you the song just made more than Saw III.
[09:48.480 --> 09:52.080]  Okay, so now we have, we are given a tough choice.
[09:52.620 --> 09:53.180]  Toy Story.
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.820]  Well, now I have inflation questions.
[09:54.920 --> 09:55.940]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[09:56.120 --> 09:57.220]  Are we adjusted or what?
[09:57.520 --> 10:01.720]  I don't think so, but I do think that we're going to find out when we do this Pinocchio
[10:01.720 --> 10:07.220]  one, because Toy Story's at $404 million and Pinocchio, which came out in 1940, I don't
[10:07.220 --> 10:10.080]  know that there was $404 million in the world.
[10:10.720 --> 10:12.440]  So I assume it's less.
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.980]  But do you think old man Disney was actually getting real totals or he's just going, oh,
[10:17.640 --> 10:19.380]  $600 million this movie made.
[10:19.760 --> 10:20.760]  It made all the money.
[10:21.160 --> 10:22.040]  Build a park.
[10:22.580 --> 10:25.220]  I think $600 million was an unfathomable number.
[10:25.400 --> 10:28.020]  Like, nobody could think of that high of a number at that time.
[10:28.060 --> 10:28.820]  So it's got to be less.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.120]  It was also in the middle of a world war.
[10:31.640 --> 10:31.860]  Yeah.
[10:32.040 --> 10:33.000]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[10:33.460 --> 10:34.040]  All right, here we go.
[10:34.060 --> 10:34.460]  Less.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.080]  $121 million.
[10:36.080 --> 10:36.920]  I'm impressed.
[10:37.300 --> 10:38.420]  I'm impressed, too.
[10:39.000 --> 10:39.840]  $121 million.
[10:40.200 --> 10:42.180]  That's how much it cost to defeat Hitler, too.
[10:42.460 --> 10:43.680]  That was like the whole war effort.
[10:43.720 --> 10:44.780]  It was the cost of Pinocchio.
[10:46.040 --> 10:46.920]  Maleficent, 2014.
[10:47.340 --> 10:48.980]  More or less than the $121?
[10:49.460 --> 10:50.240]  I'd say more.
[10:50.760 --> 10:51.420]  More, right?
[10:51.740 --> 10:52.440]  I would say more.
[10:52.840 --> 10:54.760]  It did well enough for them to make a sequel.
[10:55.260 --> 11:00.580]  And I feel like all these movies in like the 2010s, like a baseline success is like 50,
[11:00.660 --> 11:01.140]  60 mil.
[11:01.400 --> 11:02.380]  That'd be a disappointment.
[11:02.680 --> 11:02.860]  So.
[11:03.400 --> 11:04.640]  OK, here we go.
[11:04.680 --> 11:05.080]  Maleficent.
[11:05.080 --> 11:05.860]  We're saying more.
[11:06.140 --> 11:07.120]  Oh, my God.
[11:07.460 --> 11:10.080]  It made $758 million.
[11:10.320 --> 11:12.320]  That's the biggest surprise to me so far.
[11:12.760 --> 11:12.880]  Yeah.
[11:12.920 --> 11:14.360]  What the hell is The Call of the Wild?
[11:14.600 --> 11:20.540]  Now, Maleficent, it's $758 million or Call of the Wild 2020, a movie we've never heard
[11:20.540 --> 11:20.800]  of.
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.500]  Is that the dog in Harrison Ford movie?
[11:23.640 --> 11:23.680]  Yeah.
[11:23.820 --> 11:24.100]  Yes.
[11:24.220 --> 11:24.460]  OK.
[11:24.820 --> 11:27.580]  Oh, do you think that made more than $758 million?
[11:27.740 --> 11:28.660]  Not a chance in hell.
[11:29.340 --> 11:29.620]  No?
[11:30.100 --> 11:30.820]  Definitely not.
[11:31.120 --> 11:32.260]  OK, I'm going to go less.
[11:32.260 --> 11:36.520]  That's how much $758 million is how much Harrison Ford spent in Crash Plane.
[11:37.120 --> 11:37.460]  OK.
[11:38.100 --> 11:39.360]  Very interesting here.
[11:39.980 --> 11:42.540]  Call of the Wild, $2020, $107 million.
[11:43.080 --> 11:47.280]  OK, so I kind of have, oh, actually, Shawshank Redemption.
[11:47.840 --> 11:49.820]  Shawshank didn't do well in the theater, did it?
[11:50.120 --> 11:50.900]  No, it didn't.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.020]  Yeah, I think Shawshank was retroactively much more popular than it was at the time.
[11:56.180 --> 11:56.980]  I'm saying less.
[11:57.660 --> 11:59.760]  And now it's like one of the best movies, top three.
[12:00.260 --> 12:00.700]  Right.
[12:00.700 --> 12:05.700]  When we did the Birth of Your Movie Ranker, I used Box Office Mojo as a thing to like
[12:05.700 --> 12:08.520]  see all the in-year releases to try to get a feel like what was popular.
[12:09.120 --> 12:11.860]  Shawshank Redemption was at like near the bottom of the list.
[12:11.980 --> 12:12.460]  I was surprised.
[12:12.980 --> 12:14.580]  So do we think less?
[12:14.720 --> 12:15.480]  I'd say less.
[12:15.600 --> 12:15.820]  Yeah.
[12:16.060 --> 12:16.300]  OK.
[12:16.880 --> 12:17.200]  Gavin?
[12:17.540 --> 12:17.860]  Ooh.
[12:18.220 --> 12:19.320]  Gavin, what do you think?
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.380]  Like I know it was low, but was it like...
[12:21.380 --> 12:22.620]  Oh, yeah, I think less.
[12:22.780 --> 12:23.360]  Yeah, I think you're right.
[12:23.580 --> 12:27.440]  Think about 1994, how much of a hit it would be if it was $107 million.
[12:28.160 --> 12:28.200]  Yeah.
[12:28.660 --> 12:29.400]  OK, here we go.
[12:29.400 --> 12:30.840]  Shawshank Redemption, less.
[12:31.200 --> 12:32.280]  It's definitely less.
[12:32.320 --> 12:33.400]  Oh my God.
[12:34.180 --> 12:35.320]  That's the lowest yet.
[12:35.720 --> 12:37.160]  Now, $28 million.
[12:37.620 --> 12:42.220]  Do you think the Sonic the Hedgehog 1 movie made more than $28 million?
[12:42.960 --> 12:46.240]  I bet they spent more than $28 million making the frickin' hedgehog.
[12:46.680 --> 12:47.020]  Oh, yeah.
[12:47.040 --> 12:48.600]  Well, the first time or the second time?
[12:49.020 --> 12:49.920]  The second time.
[12:50.200 --> 12:50.520]  Oh, right.
[12:50.540 --> 12:51.180]  They patched it.
[12:51.400 --> 12:52.300]  They patched the trailer.
[12:52.600 --> 12:54.820]  $28 million might have been Jim Carrey's salary.
[12:55.180 --> 12:55.360]  Yeah.
[12:55.640 --> 12:56.660]  Dude, they patched the hog.
[12:56.740 --> 12:57.420]  And we got to go more.
[12:57.420 --> 13:00.180]  I think he made $10 million for Dumb and Dumber in 1994.
[13:00.960 --> 13:01.360]  Crazy.
[13:01.660 --> 13:03.100]  Which is when Shawshank Redemption came out.
[13:03.180 --> 13:03.760]  Isn't that incredible?
[13:04.260 --> 13:06.260]  All right, the hedgehog made more than $28 million.
[13:07.500 --> 13:08.480]  Oh, $306 million.
[13:08.500 --> 13:08.760]  Oh.
[13:09.800 --> 13:15.960]  $306 million for Sonic the Hedgehog versus The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug 2013.
[13:16.480 --> 13:17.680]  That's the second one, right?
[13:18.240 --> 13:19.020]  Or the third one?
[13:19.040 --> 13:19.700]  I thought it was the third one.
[13:20.100 --> 13:21.360]  No, the third one is the armies.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.640]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[13:22.660 --> 13:22.860]  You're right.
[13:22.900 --> 13:23.140]  You're right.
[13:23.300 --> 13:25.440]  I think this is the middle one.
[13:25.800 --> 13:26.920]  I did not see this movie.
[13:26.920 --> 13:27.900]  It's not the first one.
[13:28.200 --> 13:29.140]  I did not see this movie.
[13:29.160 --> 13:29.480]  I saw them.
[13:29.840 --> 13:31.360]  I can't remember how they did.
[13:31.920 --> 13:32.980]  Well, they made all three.
[13:33.540 --> 13:34.600]  Well, the first one did.
[13:34.660 --> 13:35.960]  I think they made...
[13:35.960 --> 13:38.180]  But it was like they made all of them at once, I feel like.
[13:38.760 --> 13:41.160]  Because they did this one and the next one back to back.
[13:41.600 --> 13:42.780]  Yeah, I think they were all shot together.
[13:43.240 --> 13:44.080]  I would say more.
[13:44.660 --> 13:45.460]  I would say more, but...
[13:45.460 --> 13:45.580]  Yeah, I'd be more.
[13:46.280 --> 13:48.420]  Because it's not the first one, I'd be...
[13:48.420 --> 13:49.240]  A little hesitant.
[13:49.640 --> 13:52.180]  Yeah, I'd be a little bit scared, but yeah, it's got to be more.
[13:52.680 --> 13:52.960]  More?
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.020]  It's a Hobbit film.
[13:54.300 --> 13:54.780]  I think more.
[13:54.780 --> 13:55.020]  Okay.
[13:55.980 --> 13:58.140]  306 million for Sonic the Hedgehog.
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.240]  We're at a score of 13 straight correct guesses so far.
[14:01.480 --> 14:04.000]  Will we get The Hobbit, Desolation of Smaug?
[14:04.640 --> 14:05.080]  Smaug.
[14:05.600 --> 14:05.720]  Oh!
[14:06.400 --> 14:07.000]  Holy shit.
[14:07.420 --> 14:07.760]  Killed it!
[14:07.940 --> 14:08.480]  Oh, shit.
[14:08.980 --> 14:09.860]  958 million.
[14:10.000 --> 14:10.080]  More.
[14:10.100 --> 14:10.540]  Oh, wow.
[14:10.720 --> 14:10.860]  More.
[14:10.980 --> 14:13.720]  Now, Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End.
[14:13.780 --> 14:14.440]  Which one is that?
[14:14.660 --> 14:15.240]  The last one.
[14:15.480 --> 14:15.900]  The third one.
[14:16.240 --> 14:17.520]  I thought there was like five of them.
[14:18.440 --> 14:19.880]  The third of the trilogy.
[14:20.080 --> 14:21.700]  So this is the last one with...
[14:21.700 --> 14:22.840]  Oh, I would say more.
[14:22.840 --> 14:24.680]  Oh, but it's 2007.
[14:25.520 --> 14:27.380]  Wait, this is the last one with what?
[14:27.860 --> 14:30.640]  With Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley.
[14:31.040 --> 14:36.640]  Yeah, it was before like Johnny Depp was paying off his vineyards in the ones without anyone else.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.740]  And then he came back, right?
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.760]  But then didn't Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley come back for the last one that they did?
[14:41.900 --> 14:43.520]  They make an appearance in the last one.
[14:43.640 --> 14:43.820]  Okay.
[14:44.180 --> 14:46.200]  So there's only one movie without them.
[14:46.400 --> 14:46.840]  Yes.
[14:47.160 --> 14:47.380]  Yeah.
[14:47.740 --> 14:49.260]  So this is the third of the trilogy.
[14:49.360 --> 14:50.200]  That's more important.
[14:50.300 --> 14:51.280]  This is the end.
[14:51.280 --> 14:55.940]  I would also classify them as showing up in a post-credit scene as not being in the movie.
[14:56.380 --> 14:57.680]  So this is the middle movie.
[14:57.960 --> 15:00.320]  I only saw Black Pearl and Dead Man's...
[15:01.120 --> 15:01.520]  Chest.
[15:01.720 --> 15:02.520]  Bill Nye or whatever else.
[15:02.560 --> 15:02.760]  Yeah.
[15:03.320 --> 15:04.500]  I've never seen this one.
[15:04.680 --> 15:05.000]  Was it good?
[15:05.040 --> 15:05.740]  I think these are huge.
[15:05.760 --> 15:06.080]  It's alright.
[15:06.420 --> 15:07.940]  Yeah, they get progressively worse.
[15:08.280 --> 15:09.600]  Yes, the first one's perfection.
[15:09.880 --> 15:10.560]  But here's the thing.
[15:10.720 --> 15:13.380]  Do you think it made a billion dollars in 2007?
[15:14.380 --> 15:14.800]  I do.
[15:15.240 --> 15:15.720]  I do think it did.
[15:15.720 --> 15:15.960]  Yeah, I do.
[15:16.160 --> 15:16.420]  Wow.
[15:16.420 --> 15:18.560]  Between like worldwide total, I would say more.
[15:18.960 --> 15:19.460]  I think so.
[15:20.260 --> 15:21.600]  More than The Hobbit.
[15:22.040 --> 15:22.240]  Yeah.
[15:22.700 --> 15:22.920]  Yeah.
[15:23.300 --> 15:23.660]  Okay.
[15:23.720 --> 15:24.800]  Gavin, how do you feel about it?
[15:25.200 --> 15:26.020]  They're pretty confident.
[15:26.260 --> 15:27.960]  I'm sure, but I'm happy to go with them.
[15:28.400 --> 15:28.820]  Okay.
[15:28.960 --> 15:31.140]  We're going to go with more Pirates of the Caribbean.
[15:32.240 --> 15:32.720]  Wow.
[15:34.020 --> 15:34.500]  Barely.
[15:34.700 --> 15:38.000]  It was like $958 to $960 million.
[15:38.380 --> 15:39.500]  That's crazy.
[15:40.880 --> 15:43.980]  That was a lot of confidence for a $2 million dollar guess.
[15:44.580 --> 15:44.800]  Okay.
[15:45.180 --> 15:48.220]  But next, we have The Incredibles 2.
[15:48.220 --> 15:49.360]  From 2018.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.220]  This is hard.
[15:50.220 --> 15:50.780]  Here's the thing.
[15:51.200 --> 15:51.720]  Well, no.
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.640]  I think it's sort of easier because for Incredibles 2 to pass, I feel like it's hitting a billion.
[15:56.780 --> 15:58.520]  I don't think Incredibles 2 made a billion dollars.
[15:58.620 --> 15:58.800]  Yeah.
[15:58.980 --> 15:59.520]  I'd say less.
[15:59.860 --> 16:00.100]  Really?
[16:00.220 --> 16:01.140]  You don't think it made a billion?
[16:02.080 --> 16:04.400]  I think there's such a small pool of movies.
[16:04.620 --> 16:06.940]  It's like The Dark Knight, Avatar, Titanic.
[16:07.180 --> 16:10.600]  Like, I think crossing over a billion is a significant thing.
[16:11.100 --> 16:13.120]  In 2018, it wasn't as significant though, is it?
[16:13.400 --> 16:13.920]  I think so.
[16:13.920 --> 16:19.800]  I still think there's less than seven movies, I'd say, that have made over a billion dollars.
[16:20.260 --> 16:21.960]  And I could be completely wrong on that.
[16:22.180 --> 16:26.040]  I feel like anytime a movie crosses a billion, it's a really big deal.
[16:26.480 --> 16:30.120]  I just feel like the Marvel movies came out and then it was like, everyone's crossing a billion.
[16:30.500 --> 16:31.300]  That could be true.
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.660]  Like, Avengers movies crossed two billion.
[16:34.420 --> 16:34.780]  Really?
[16:34.960 --> 16:35.940]  Or three billion, didn't it?
[16:36.240 --> 16:38.240]  Didn't one of them do, like, ape shit?
[16:38.560 --> 16:39.460]  I think so.
[16:39.460 --> 16:44.260]  But is Incredibles 2, are we going to say, bigger than the third Pirates of the Caribbean?
[16:44.420 --> 16:45.100]  I don't think so.
[16:45.380 --> 16:46.740]  Which was bigger in China.
[16:47.280 --> 16:48.300]  Yeah, exactly.
[16:48.620 --> 16:50.300]  And that's tough.
[16:50.600 --> 16:52.040]  Superhero stuff, big stuff.
[16:52.200 --> 16:53.200]  Animated movie, big stuff.
[16:53.320 --> 16:54.600]  Kids movie, big stuff.
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.140]  But Pirates, third in the trilogy, which I've been told, is very important, which I've been told.
[17:00.500 --> 17:01.360]  Disney movie as well.
[17:01.520 --> 17:01.620]  Kind of a kids movie.
[17:02.000 --> 17:03.200]  Do we want to say less?
[17:03.480 --> 17:04.160]  I think it's less.
[17:04.320 --> 17:05.160]  I think it's less.
[17:05.920 --> 17:06.180]  Okay.
[17:06.320 --> 17:06.680]  Okay.
[17:07.200 --> 17:07.800]  Here we go.
[17:07.800 --> 17:09.000]  Oh, God.
[17:09.960 --> 17:10.320]  No!
[17:10.980 --> 17:12.160]  It's so much more.
[17:12.440 --> 17:14.340]  It was so much more.
[17:15.180 --> 17:16.560]  1.2 billion.
[17:17.140 --> 17:19.200]  That must be one of the six movies that's made.
[17:19.220 --> 17:19.880]  That was on me.
[17:20.220 --> 17:23.240]  I'm just, I had a billion confidence.
[17:25.400 --> 17:31.360]  We got 15 straight, and that's a silver medal, according to this game.
[17:31.440 --> 17:32.060]  That's not bad.
[17:32.160 --> 17:32.700]  That's not bad.
[17:32.820 --> 17:33.520]  Can we get gold?
[17:33.940 --> 17:36.260]  You want to take, yeah, I was going to say, you want to take another crack at it, boys?
[17:36.280 --> 17:36.860]  Yeah, we do.
[17:36.860 --> 17:37.640]  Okay.
[17:37.960 --> 17:38.400]  Absolutely.
[17:38.780 --> 17:41.220]  Did you look up how many movies made over a billion dollars?
[17:41.340 --> 17:42.260]  I'm looking up right now.
[17:42.720 --> 17:44.360]  As of April 9th, 2025.
[17:44.360 --> 17:44.860]  You're cheating!
[17:45.720 --> 17:47.660]  57 movies have grossed over a billion.
[17:48.640 --> 17:53.460]  Now, that is slightly, that's, I'm doing the math on my end.
[17:53.620 --> 17:55.160]  That's slightly more than like three.
[17:55.500 --> 17:56.020]  He said six.
[17:56.380 --> 17:57.020]  Oh, six.
[17:57.140 --> 17:58.740]  Well, six is slightly more than three also.
[17:58.960 --> 18:00.160]  So, pretty neck and neck.
[18:00.460 --> 18:02.060]  You just gotta times it by like nine.
[18:02.540 --> 18:03.200]  It's pretty close.
[18:04.080 --> 18:04.300]  Yeah.
[18:05.200 --> 18:05.640]  Okay.
[18:05.640 --> 18:05.900]  Yeah.
[18:06.060 --> 18:07.200]  You want to give it another shot?
[18:07.300 --> 18:07.420]  Yeah.
[18:07.500 --> 18:07.840]  Yes.
[18:08.280 --> 18:08.960]  All right, here we go.
[18:09.040 --> 18:09.420]  Try again.
[18:09.760 --> 18:10.320]  Silver medal, not bad.
[18:10.420 --> 18:14.680]  If I was in the Olympics and someone said not bad and gave me a silver medal, I'd be like...
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.500]  Hey, Moonlight, 2016, at 65 million, which we've seen already.
[18:21.280 --> 18:22.720]  Frozen 2, 2019.
[18:22.940 --> 18:23.800]  Do you think it's more or less?
[18:24.100 --> 18:24.300]  Definitely more.
[18:24.960 --> 18:25.300]  More?
[18:25.540 --> 18:25.700]  Significantly more.
[18:25.700 --> 18:26.020]  You think so?
[18:26.040 --> 18:26.200]  Yep.
[18:26.320 --> 18:26.620]  All right.
[18:26.820 --> 18:28.160]  Let's see if it's one of the 57.
[18:28.480 --> 18:29.360]  It sure is!
[18:29.800 --> 18:30.440]  Oh, less.
[18:30.480 --> 18:31.940]  1.450.
[18:32.820 --> 18:33.380]  Oh, onward?
[18:33.380 --> 18:33.580]  Onward?
[18:33.580 --> 18:34.020]  Nope, less.
[18:34.280 --> 18:34.600]  Onward bombed.
[18:34.620 --> 18:35.380]  Never heard of it.
[18:35.480 --> 18:36.540]  Hey, what is Onward?
[18:36.780 --> 18:38.540]  It's a Pixar movie that came out during the pandemic.
[18:39.220 --> 18:39.920]  It's actually good.
[18:40.320 --> 18:43.940]  Yeah, it is Chris Pratt and who's the kid who plays Spider-Man?
[18:44.260 --> 18:44.600]  What's his name?
[18:44.740 --> 18:45.240]  Tom Holland.
[18:45.680 --> 18:45.900]  Yeah.
[18:46.340 --> 18:46.540]  Huh.
[18:46.600 --> 18:46.840]  Good movie.
[18:46.840 --> 18:51.220]  I tried to watch a Mario movie on a plane and that's crazy.
[18:51.320 --> 18:52.380]  I can't believe people enjoyed that.
[18:52.480 --> 18:53.100]  That's wild.
[18:53.820 --> 18:54.820]  I'm Pratt-ed out.
[18:55.040 --> 18:55.260]  Yeah.
[18:55.420 --> 18:56.100]  I'm with you.
[18:56.160 --> 18:56.240]  Big time.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.220]  I think the world is Pratt-ed out.
[18:57.720 --> 18:59.800]  I'm going to guess that Onward made less.
[19:00.020 --> 19:00.860]  Yeah, definitely less.
[19:01.080 --> 19:01.680]  Definitely less.
[19:01.700 --> 19:02.100]  It bombed.
[19:02.100 --> 19:02.180]  It bombed.
[19:02.520 --> 19:03.840]  At least for their expectation.
[19:04.000 --> 19:04.480]  It was a disappointment.
[19:04.500 --> 19:05.120]  Yeah, no kidding.
[19:05.600 --> 19:07.500]  Oh, Grindelwald though.
[19:08.580 --> 19:09.580]  Onward, 2020.
[19:10.240 --> 19:11.240]  103 million.
[19:12.200 --> 19:16.400]  Versus Fantastic Beasts, The Crimes of Grindelwald from 2018.
[19:16.740 --> 19:17.520]  Is this the second one?
[19:18.020 --> 19:19.120]  Fucking Grindelwald.
[19:19.560 --> 19:20.840]  His crimes are well known.
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.320]  But did people see the movie?
[19:22.640 --> 19:23.340]  What was his crimes?
[19:23.640 --> 19:25.140]  We had to ban him from our Twitch channel.
[19:25.460 --> 19:27.200]  Grindelwald always caused the problems.
[19:28.200 --> 19:29.920]  Grindelwald and Schindler's Fist.
[19:30.060 --> 19:30.900]  Hand in hand.
[19:31.580 --> 19:32.080]  Grindelwald and Schindler's Fist.
[19:37.420 --> 19:39.560]  I would say more.
[19:39.960 --> 19:40.820]  It's got to be more, right?
[19:40.900 --> 19:42.420]  More than 103 million?
[19:42.680 --> 19:43.080]  I think so.
[19:43.100 --> 19:43.280]  It's got to be.
[19:43.400 --> 19:43.640]  Definitely.
[19:44.140 --> 19:44.460]  Okay.
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.640]  And then they replaced Johnny Depp in the next one.
[19:46.900 --> 19:47.020]  Yeah.
[19:48.140 --> 19:48.940]  654 million.
[19:49.200 --> 19:55.340]  Now Gavin, do you think Fantastic Beasts, The Crimes of Grindelwald made more or less
[19:55.340 --> 19:56.640]  than Clark's 1994?
[19:56.640 --> 20:02.480]  It would be awesome if a film beat that, that was black and white, but only because it couldn't
[20:02.480 --> 20:03.500]  afford color.
[20:06.100 --> 20:06.580]  Less.
[20:06.980 --> 20:07.600]  You think so?
[20:07.840 --> 20:14.680]  Are you guys looking at the, uh, the image here and it says like, Clark's Spezdachy?
[20:16.720 --> 20:16.880]  Speedway?
[20:18.200 --> 20:19.640]  Why does it say that?
[20:19.740 --> 20:19.940]  I don't know.
[20:19.940 --> 20:20.660]  Why does it say that?
[20:20.980 --> 20:22.860]  Is it like a Russian cover?
[20:23.240 --> 20:23.660]  I don't know.
[20:23.880 --> 20:24.100]  Weird.
[20:24.560 --> 20:25.600]  Anyway, uh, less.
[20:26.140 --> 20:26.400]  Okay.
[20:26.400 --> 20:28.220]  Didn't they make a cartoon of Clark's?
[20:28.220 --> 20:28.660]  Yeah.
[20:28.860 --> 20:30.080]  The cartoon's great.
[20:30.420 --> 20:30.640]  Yeah.
[20:30.740 --> 20:31.780]  The cartoon's a lot of fun.
[20:31.960 --> 20:32.200]  Yeah.
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.660]  Could you imagine if Transformers Age of Extinction made less?
[20:39.220 --> 20:40.840]  People would have been murdered.
[20:41.640 --> 20:43.140]  Clark's made $3 million.
[20:43.680 --> 20:47.080]  Do you think Transformers Age of Extinction made more or less than that?
[20:47.160 --> 20:48.160]  I think maybe more.
[20:48.540 --> 20:49.080]  Yeah, just a bit.
[20:49.080 --> 20:49.520]  Maybe more.
[20:50.040 --> 20:50.300]  Maybe.
[20:50.380 --> 20:51.400]  Maybe 100 times more.
[20:51.680 --> 20:53.820]  Maybe 300 times more.
[20:53.840 --> 20:54.640]  Another one of the 50s.
[20:54.740 --> 20:55.000]  Whatever.

[21:56.000 --> 21:57.700]  Another one of them. There you go.
[21:58.400 --> 22:00.760]  Transformers Age of Extinction, $1 billion.
[22:01.900 --> 22:06.160]  Versus Superman Returns 2006, more or less for Superman Returns.
[22:06.400 --> 22:13.820]  I think I remember Superman Returns being one of the first movies to cost over $200 million or something.
[22:14.380 --> 22:19.440]  The way you said that sounded like it was going to be a piece of trivia that helps us, and it was completely useless.
[22:19.760 --> 22:21.320]  Now I agree with Andrew.
[22:22.020 --> 22:25.740]  Well, just that they spent so much, they probably assumed they would make like a billion dollars.
[22:26.220 --> 22:28.600]  Absolutely, but that's not how any of that works.
[22:29.040 --> 22:35.300]  I think this movie led to them redoing Superman altogether, which makes me think it didn't do that well.
[22:35.480 --> 22:40.440]  Yeah, that's a great point, Nick. That is some good investigative work. I agree. I think it's less.
[22:41.620 --> 22:43.440]  I think we would have got a sequel if it did that.
[22:43.440 --> 22:46.160]  It was like a sequel of Superman. It was like Superman 5.
[22:46.160 --> 22:54.100]  Okay, Superman Returns less. Here we go. Oh yeah. $391 million.
[22:55.040 --> 23:01.000]  Now, Superman Returns, $391 million. Uncut Gems 2019, more or less.
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.200]  I want to be in a group that has to debate whether it is more or less. I want to hang out with those people and be like,
[23:07.280 --> 23:10.900]  Uncut Gems? It's a Sandler movie. It is a Sandler.
[23:11.300 --> 23:13.060]  Yeah, but people raved about this movie.
[23:13.640 --> 23:14.500]  It's definitely less.
[23:14.940 --> 23:17.640]  It's definitely less. Do you think it made...
[23:17.640 --> 23:18.160]  I have no idea.
[23:18.540 --> 23:20.000]  Do you think it made like $150 million?
[23:20.300 --> 23:21.020]  Oh, I don't know.
[23:21.460 --> 23:25.600]  Movies like Uncut Gems, it's hard to track because I feel like the release schedule is odd.
[23:25.840 --> 23:30.440]  Or it'll be limited and then it'll get hype and then it'll come out wide later, but to what extent?
[23:31.040 --> 23:31.820]  Gavin, what do you think?
[23:33.200 --> 23:33.600]  Less...
[23:33.600 --> 23:34.640]  Less it is.
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.280]  $50 million. Wow.
[23:37.880 --> 23:48.060]  Terminator Dark Fate, which is the 2019 Terminator, which when we worked at Reaster Teeth, we went and saw in the middle of the day,
[23:48.420 --> 23:55.340]  one day at work, we just went and saw Terminator Dark Fate and we took Tobin, who worked in the merch department,
[23:55.560 --> 23:57.660]  and this was the first Terminator he ever saw.
[23:57.880 --> 23:58.340]  Oh no.
[23:58.340 --> 23:58.840]  Did he like it?
[23:59.940 --> 24:01.680]  He went like...
[24:01.680 --> 24:06.100]  I think he left and was like, yeah, I don't really like... I don't know that I really get it,
[24:06.100 --> 24:07.540]  but it was fun, I guess.
[24:08.120 --> 24:08.840]  Did you get it?
[24:09.240 --> 24:10.140]  This movie sucked.
[24:11.060 --> 24:16.080]  It was like this endoskeleton and exoskeleton and they didn't do anything with it. It sucked.
[24:16.600 --> 24:17.080]  It's terrible.
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.860]  But more, right?
[24:20.060 --> 24:20.760]  Definitely more.
[24:21.460 --> 24:23.020]  It's got Terminator in the name.
[24:23.480 --> 24:26.520]  There you go. $261, which I think is probably low.
[24:26.840 --> 24:27.560]  Oh no.
[24:28.200 --> 24:28.640]  Wow.
[24:29.640 --> 24:32.300]  Terminator Dark Fate 2019, $261 million.
[24:33.580 --> 24:38.080]  Star Wars Empire Strikes Back from 1980, more or less than $261 million.
[24:38.280 --> 24:39.380]  Has to be more, right?
[24:39.500 --> 24:40.320]  I feel like more.
[24:40.760 --> 24:44.000]  I mean, with adjusted, it's definitely more.
[24:44.360 --> 24:44.760]  Right.
[24:45.240 --> 24:47.700]  But we saw from Pinocchio that I don't think it's adjusted.
[24:47.840 --> 24:48.060]  Yeah.
[24:48.420 --> 24:51.000]  Because people would see Star Wars like 35 times.
[24:51.580 --> 24:53.020]  Yeah, I still think it's more.
[24:53.220 --> 24:54.160]  Because it was before video.
[24:54.720 --> 24:56.500]  Okay, I think it's got to be more.
[24:56.860 --> 24:57.240]  I agree.
[24:57.540 --> 24:57.920]  Here we go.
[24:57.920 --> 24:59.400]  Oh wow.
[24:59.900 --> 25:00.380]  Geez.
[25:00.740 --> 25:02.080]  $547 now.
[25:02.460 --> 25:04.040]  Very interesting.
[25:04.280 --> 25:04.860]  The fourth one?
[25:05.740 --> 25:08.720]  Empire Strikes Back at $547 million.
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.140]  Versus Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides from 2011.
[25:14.700 --> 25:16.040]  Yeah, if I remember correctly,
[25:16.100 --> 25:17.160]  the only returning character
[25:17.160 --> 25:18.900]  from the first movies
[25:18.900 --> 25:20.160]  is Johnny Depp in this.
[25:20.240 --> 25:22.900]  Yeah, Johnny Depp and I think Salma Hayek
[25:22.900 --> 25:23.640]  is in this one.
[25:23.660 --> 25:24.800]  Do you think that hurt it?
[25:24.800 --> 25:27.400]  Do you think it made less than $547 million?
[25:27.840 --> 25:28.640]  I don't think it hurt it.
[25:28.740 --> 25:31.740]  I think Johnny Depp is like the guy for these movies.
[25:31.880 --> 25:33.860]  I think not having him in it would hurt more.
[25:34.120 --> 25:35.180]  Ian McShane's in it.
[25:35.840 --> 25:36.240]  Does that help?
[25:36.360 --> 25:39.120]  So is, uh, Stephen Graham.
[25:39.460 --> 25:40.840]  I don't know. Do you think that helped?
[25:41.580 --> 25:42.680]  Do you think people went,
[25:42.820 --> 25:44.340]  Dude, Ian McShane's in it. I gotta go see this.
[25:44.520 --> 25:45.760]  Hey man, I saw Deadwood. It's great.
[25:48.180 --> 25:49.620]  I lean towards more
[25:49.620 --> 25:50.280]  just because
[25:50.980 --> 25:53.540]  they wrapped up the trilogy. It did well.
[25:54.040 --> 25:55.580]  And this was like their new start
[25:55.580 --> 25:57.280]  doing solo movies.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Shit. Yeah, I'd say more.
[26:00.200 --> 26:01.020]  Globally, I think more.
[26:01.380 --> 26:03.360]  Okay, here we go. Worldwide gross.
[26:04.260 --> 26:06.380]  $547 million. We're at a score
[26:06.380 --> 26:08.200]  of 9. Oh, it did it.
[26:08.200 --> 26:09.380]  Oh, it's one of the billions.
[26:09.960 --> 26:10.440]  Hahaha.
[26:12.800 --> 26:13.160]  Uh,
[26:13.840 --> 26:16.460]  $1 billion over a billion dollars.
[26:16.760 --> 26:18.300]  Now, that's Pirates of the Caribbean
[26:18.300 --> 26:20.080]  on Stranger Tides vs Beauty and the Beast
[26:20.680 --> 26:21.160]  2017.
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.500]  So not the original animated
[26:23.500 --> 26:25.520]  the remake live action one
[26:25.520 --> 26:26.860]  with the animated
[26:27.700 --> 26:29.940]  beast man or whatever. Yeah, it looked like
[26:29.940 --> 26:31.820]  shit. And what's her name? Can't sing.
[26:32.500 --> 26:33.960]  I have zero read on this.
[26:34.580 --> 26:35.840]  Me too. None. I mean,
[26:35.880 --> 26:37.880]  I assume it made less than a billion dollars.
[26:38.120 --> 26:39.880]  I would think so. Was this at the beginning
[26:39.880 --> 26:42.060]  of the end of them remaking
[26:42.060 --> 26:43.980]  all of the nice cartoons with CG?
[26:44.460 --> 26:45.800]  No. Yes. They're still
[26:45.800 --> 26:46.980]  doing that. They're still doing it.
[26:47.180 --> 26:50.060]  But it's already in the shit. People already don't give a shit
[26:50.060 --> 26:52.760]  This one? No. This one was
[26:52.760 --> 26:54.940]  like the first big one. Snow White
[26:54.940 --> 26:56.960]  absolutely bombed. That was the most recent one.
[26:57.260 --> 26:58.780]  I think this was like
[26:59.480 --> 27:00.580]  the height of it. Yeah.
[27:00.680 --> 27:02.900]  This was like when people were excited about it still.
[27:03.560 --> 27:04.520]  Yeah. I don't know who.
[27:04.660 --> 27:06.740]  I don't know any of those people who were excited about it
[27:06.740 --> 27:08.340]  but they were. Maybe it's gonna be
[27:08.340 --> 27:10.420]  1.047.
[27:12.100 --> 27:12.780]  Just over
[27:12.780 --> 27:14.160]  that 2 million mark.
[27:15.160 --> 27:16.920]  I gotta say less. It's gotta be less
[27:16.920 --> 27:17.840]  than a billion. It's gotta be less.
[27:17.840 --> 27:19.760]  I'm willing to bet it did okay though.
[27:20.420 --> 27:22.420]  I'm so on the fence I'm useless.
[27:23.060 --> 27:24.620]  I'm happy to go with whatever
[27:24.620 --> 27:26.580]  you guys think. You gotta make a call
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.560]  Andrew. You gotta make a call.
[27:32.100 --> 27:33.480]  I guess less.
[27:34.480 --> 27:36.780]  But if somebody told me it made more than a billion
[27:36.780 --> 27:38.560]  it wouldn't be shocking to me at all.
[27:39.040 --> 27:39.360]  I
[27:40.480 --> 27:41.840]  bet it's over a billion.
[27:42.520 --> 27:43.500]  You think so?
[27:44.880 --> 27:46.360]  Yeah. I could see it.
[27:46.360 --> 27:48.900]  I mean it is Disney. It's really the first remake
[27:48.900 --> 27:50.780]  of a musical. Beauty and the Beast is
[27:50.780 --> 27:53.040]  fucking huge. It's got Emma
[27:53.040 --> 27:55.000]  Watson in it. And the dude from Downton.
[27:55.260 --> 27:57.060]  People were really excited about it
[27:57.060 --> 27:59.000]  but I don't think people liked it?
[27:59.200 --> 28:01.160]  Yeah just that doesn't mean anything though
[28:01.160 --> 28:02.900]  cause they probably saw
[28:02.900 --> 28:04.940]  the shit out of it and then universally
[28:04.940 --> 28:06.840]  decided it was shite. Yeah.
[28:09.040 --> 28:10.540]  I don't know. Why don't we vote?
[28:10.980 --> 28:12.980]  I think we're a 2-2 if we vote
[28:12.980 --> 28:13.760]  it as a problem.
[28:14.380 --> 28:16.420]  Yeah but I'm running the thing
[28:16.420 --> 28:17.720]  so it's up to you three.
[28:18.120 --> 28:20.460]  I lean less. I would go more.
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.720]  Well that's you Gavin. You decide.
[28:24.040 --> 28:25.800]  I'll go more. Okay here we go.
[28:26.160 --> 28:28.400]  We have a score of 10 so far. Can we get
[28:28.400 --> 28:29.980]  their high score of 15?
[28:30.300 --> 28:32.780]  1,045,000,000
[28:32.780 --> 28:33.760]  Here we go. Come on!
[28:33.960 --> 28:35.420]  We are guessing more. Come on!
[28:35.760 --> 28:36.240]  Wow!
[28:38.940 --> 28:41.000]  1,263,000,000
[28:42.160 --> 28:42.640]  Wow!
[28:43.600 --> 28:44.000]  Listen!
[28:45.940 --> 28:46.340]  Crazy!
[28:47.540 --> 28:48.980]  Incredible! Yeah that was the start.
[28:49.240 --> 28:51.460]  Now it's Beauty and the Beast from 2017
[28:51.460 --> 28:54.600]  at 1,263,000,000
[28:54.600 --> 28:55.640]  in Mad Max
[28:55.640 --> 28:56.640]  from 1979.
[28:57.180 --> 28:58.640]  Do you think it made a billion dollars?
[28:58.820 --> 29:01.400]  It's definitely less but I'm curious to see how much it did make.
[29:01.820 --> 29:02.860]  I bet it's like
[29:03.220 --> 29:05.140]  dude if it's even 90,000,000 I'll be shocked.
[29:05.880 --> 29:07.100]  Alright here we go. Less
[29:07.100 --> 29:08.300]  Yeah that's what I thought.
[29:09.020 --> 29:11.120]  Not even 9,000,000. More! More! More!
[29:11.670 --> 29:13.780]  Mad Max made 8,000,000 dollars
[29:13.780 --> 29:15.020]  Knives out
[29:15.720 --> 29:17.580]  2019. More? Probably more.
[29:17.920 --> 29:20.040]  I would say more. But if it was Glass Onion
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.900]  it would really fuck me up because it's a Netflix
[29:21.900 --> 29:23.880]  movie and I'm sure they released it in theaters
[29:23.880 --> 29:25.820]  to some extent. I wouldn't know how to measure that.
[29:26.140 --> 29:27.680]  Alright knives out. More?
[29:28.880 --> 29:29.240]  Oh yeah.
[29:30.780 --> 29:32.000]  309,000,000
[29:32.000 --> 29:32.860]  Now
[29:32.860 --> 29:35.780]  it's Knives Out 2019 with 309,000,000
[29:35.780 --> 29:37.740]  versus Spider-Man 3 from
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.680]  2007. So much more.
[29:40.320 --> 29:42.420]  It has to be more. So much more.
[29:43.100 --> 29:44.540]  After 2, 2 is
[29:44.540 --> 29:46.620]  like what an incredible movie Spider-Man 2
[29:46.620 --> 29:47.640]  was and then 3 came out.
[29:47.980 --> 29:50.140]  Which is the one where his boss comes off while he's
[29:50.140 --> 29:51.960]  stopping the train. That
[29:51.960 --> 29:53.100]  is 2.
[29:54.740 --> 29:56.460]  This is the one where Venom's
[29:56.460 --> 29:58.300]  in it. Topher Grace is in it and he's Venom.
[29:58.480 --> 30:00.500]  And he has like little fangs. It's very funny.
[30:00.620 --> 30:01.800]  Perfectly cast. They nailed it.
[30:02.260 --> 30:04.380]  More! Damn good for them.
[30:05.300 --> 30:06.400]  894,000,000
[30:06.400 --> 30:08.400]  dollars for Spider-Man 3
[30:08.400 --> 30:10.640]  versus Halloween 1978.
[30:11.400 --> 30:12.280]  Less. Less.
[30:13.020 --> 30:14.920]  I think Halloween is going to be making
[30:14.920 --> 30:16.720]  less than Spider-Man 3. That's my guess.
[30:17.840 --> 30:18.900]  When we get this here
[30:18.900 --> 30:20.980]  we're going to tie our high score. Are you guys ready to tie
[30:20.980 --> 30:22.940]  the high score? Do you think if you combined
[30:22.940 --> 30:24.680]  all of John Carpenter's films
[30:24.680 --> 30:26.580]  it would total 894,000,000?
[30:28.180 --> 30:28.620]  Maybe.
[30:29.200 --> 30:29.640]  Maybe.
[30:30.700 --> 30:32.980]  47,000,000 on the nose. Look at that.
[30:33.220 --> 30:35.380]  Not a dollar over 47,000,000
[30:35.380 --> 30:37.000]  dollars. That's a clean number right there.
[30:37.960 --> 30:39.540]  We've tied our high score. We are in
[30:39.540 --> 30:41.500]  silver medal range. Good try.
[30:42.040 --> 30:43.500]  Now, Halloween 1978
[30:43.500 --> 30:45.320]  47,000,000 versus Ford
[30:45.320 --> 30:47.980]  versus Ferrari 2019 more or less.
[30:48.520 --> 30:49.300]  More. More.
[30:49.960 --> 30:51.880]  It has to be more just based
[30:51.880 --> 30:53.880]  on it says Matt Damon and Christian Bale
[30:53.880 --> 30:55.660]  and that just means I think more
[30:55.660 --> 30:57.720]  automatically. It also says Ford and Ferrari.
[30:58.420 --> 30:59.560]  Yeah. But
[30:59.560 --> 31:01.540]  225,000,000. You know
[31:01.540 --> 31:02.860]  I think this one would be more.
[31:03.400 --> 31:04.780]  You know what? I think
[31:04.780 --> 31:07.600]  The Hobbit Destination of Smaug might be
[31:07.600 --> 31:08.600]  more. Okay.
[31:09.400 --> 31:10.800]  We'll just go ahead and click on it.
[31:11.320 --> 31:12.920]  One of the six. Almost.
[31:13.900 --> 31:15.080]  958,000,000 versus
[31:15.080 --> 31:16.600]  Battleship 2012.
[31:17.920 --> 31:19.240]  Battleship. That'd be less.
[31:19.680 --> 31:21.420]  I still have never seen that movie. It does not
[31:21.420 --> 31:23.760]  make any sense to me. Didn't it have Rihanna?
[31:24.400 --> 31:24.780]  It does.
[31:25.840 --> 31:27.240]  I own the 360 game
[31:27.240 --> 31:29.580]  that's a first person shooter but I've never played it.
[31:30.060 --> 31:31.160]  What? Oh dude.
[31:31.160 --> 31:33.120]  We should play it for content.
[31:33.120 --> 31:35.860]  I bought it for content
[31:35.860 --> 31:37.700]  but we haven't done it yet. Damn.
[31:38.380 --> 31:39.880]  Okay, so definitely less.
[31:40.220 --> 31:41.620]  Oh yeah. Okay.
[31:42.220 --> 31:43.760]  303,000,000. That's a
[31:43.760 --> 31:45.660]  shitload for that. Yeah.
[31:46.180 --> 31:47.420]  Sex and the City 2008.
[31:47.820 --> 31:49.820]  Just four years prior. Sex
[31:49.820 --> 31:51.220]  and the City the movie.
[31:52.020 --> 31:53.980]  The City alone would be over
[31:53.980 --> 31:55.900]  300,000,000. You add sex
[31:55.900 --> 31:58.040]  into the mix. You would think
[31:58.040 --> 31:59.720]  but then... I don't know. I think the sex
[31:59.720 --> 32:01.840]  maybe brings it down. You think the sex brings it
[32:01.840 --> 32:03.540]  down? Yeah, yeah. Maybe.
[32:03.840 --> 32:05.980]  People are paying for the city. I would say more.
[32:06.480 --> 32:07.860]  I think the movie did really well.
[32:08.880 --> 32:09.880]  Gavin? Yeah, I'd go
[32:09.880 --> 32:11.780]  more for that. There's a sex in the City
[32:11.780 --> 32:13.460]  the movie too. There's no battleship too.
[32:13.640 --> 32:16.040]  Yep, true. 418,000,000
[32:16.040 --> 32:17.900]  there for Sex and the City 2008.
[32:18.460 --> 32:20.000]  Oh boy. And we have to see
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  if the Lone Ranger. What is that?
[32:22.240 --> 32:23.800]  Nobody wanted it. Do I know about that?
[32:24.100 --> 32:25.660]  What do you mean? Johnny Depp and
[32:26.300 --> 32:27.840]  Armie Hammer? Yep.
[32:28.320 --> 32:29.960]  Yep. Before he ate people or
[32:29.960 --> 32:32.100]  whatever. No, no, no, not before.
[32:32.700 --> 32:34.180]  I'm sure he was eating people during
[32:34.180 --> 32:35.560]  this. In the midst of people eating.
[32:36.680 --> 32:37.980]  Yes. Do you think it's
[32:37.980 --> 32:40.160]  less? I would say less, yeah. I think so.
[32:40.580 --> 32:41.620]  It was a huge disappointment. That movie sucked.
[32:42.660 --> 32:43.100]  Okay.
[32:44.260 --> 32:45.980]  260,000,000 for the movie that sucked.
[32:46.400 --> 32:47.980]  Monsters University, we already know
[32:47.980 --> 32:49.420]  it's more, right? Way more. Okay.
[32:50.020 --> 32:51.660]  Considerably more. 743,000,000.
[32:51.720 --> 32:53.880]  Terminator Salvation. Saw this movie
[32:53.880 --> 32:56.220]  in theaters. Good for you!
[32:58.520 --> 32:59.180]  Snuck in
[32:59.180 --> 33:00.940]  a bottle of whiskey with two friends.
[33:01.000 --> 33:02.760]  Hated every second of this movie. It was
[33:02.760 --> 33:04.280]  miserable. I don't think it made 743.
[33:05.160 --> 33:06.940]  I think it did fine. I also don't
[33:06.940 --> 33:08.760]  think it did either. Because when I saw it in theaters,
[33:08.960 --> 33:10.820]  it was us, it was me, my two
[33:10.820 --> 33:12.960]  friends, and one other guy. So
[33:13.400 --> 33:14.960]  I assume nobody saw this movie.
[33:15.320 --> 33:16.860]  They didn't make a sequel. They
[33:16.860 --> 33:18.860]  kind of let this die. It's not the
[33:18.860 --> 33:20.480]  first bad one. No.
[33:20.700 --> 33:22.340]  No. No, it's not.
[33:23.420 --> 33:24.720]  So it's gotta be less.
[33:24.720 --> 33:26.860]  Yep. And it's certainly not the last
[33:26.860 --> 33:27.620]  bad one either.
[33:29.160 --> 33:30.380]  371,000,000 now.
[33:30.820 --> 33:32.640]  Cats. Better or worse than Terminator Salvation.
[33:32.820 --> 33:34.800]  Who remembers how much it made? I don't,
[33:34.880 --> 33:36.700]  but it's less. Wasn't it like 207?
[33:37.080 --> 33:38.520]  Yeah, I think it was less. Was it?
[33:38.520 --> 33:40.860]  Okay. Cats less. Here we go.
[33:41.320 --> 33:42.640]  Yeah. Ooh, 73.
[33:43.220 --> 33:44.720]  Ooh. Django Unchained
[33:44.720 --> 33:46.220]  2012. That's more.
[33:46.740 --> 33:48.540]  Gotta be, right? Yeah. Okay.
[33:49.080 --> 33:50.820]  Oh yeah. Wow. 425,000,000.
[33:51.420 --> 33:52.780]  Pirates of the Caribbean
[33:52.780 --> 33:54.620]  Dead Men Tell No Tales
[33:54.620 --> 33:56.900]  from 2017. How many freaking
[33:56.900 --> 33:58.600]  movies are there? This is the
[33:58.600 --> 34:00.640]  fifth one. It's more.
[34:01.100 --> 34:02.720]  They brought back Jeffrey
[34:03.260 --> 34:04.800]  Rush. What's his name? Rush? Yeah.
[34:05.180 --> 34:06.840]  Barbosa. Yeah, Barbosa.
[34:07.180 --> 34:08.820]  So we're gonna say more or less?
[34:09.060 --> 34:10.760]  More. I guess more. Let's say
[34:10.760 --> 34:12.860]  more. I mean, they stopped making them after this though, didn't
[34:12.860 --> 34:14.540]  they? That might be because of Johnny Depp.
[34:17.920 --> 34:19.240]  Wow. 794,000,000.
[34:19.380 --> 34:20.440]  That's a hell of a franchise.
[34:21.240 --> 34:22.880]  Definitely because of Johnny Depp.
[34:23.620 --> 34:24.260]  Pirates of the Caribbean
[34:24.800 --> 34:26.280]  Dead Men Tell No Tales
[34:26.280 --> 34:28.120]  at 794,000,000.
[34:28.780 --> 34:30.400]  Versus just a year earlier
[34:30.400 --> 34:31.920]  Batman v Superman
[34:32.220 --> 34:33.380]  Dawn of Justice.
[34:34.140 --> 34:36.100]  On paper that feels so huge.
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.500]  Yeah. This was first
[34:38.500 --> 34:40.480]  Affleck Batman, right?
[34:40.920 --> 34:42.140]  Yes. I think so.
[34:42.360 --> 34:44.440]  This is after Man of Steel, the direct
[34:44.440 --> 34:46.420]  sequel. I bet it would be more, but
[34:46.420 --> 34:48.460]  like, close. I'm good
[34:48.460 --> 34:50.540]  with more. Just on the names alone
[34:50.540 --> 34:52.140]  of Batman and Superman. Yeah?
[34:52.520 --> 34:54.440]  Yeah, because Man of Steel people
[34:54.440 --> 34:56.480]  were okay with, I think. I think this
[34:56.480 --> 34:58.520]  is the era still of like, you kind
[34:58.520 --> 35:00.000]  of have to see every superhero movie.
[35:00.360 --> 35:02.280]  There's still that mindset. Here it is.
[35:02.380 --> 35:05.060]  We're saying more. More than 794,000,000.
[35:06.660 --> 35:08.060]  Wow. That was close.
[35:08.880 --> 35:10.580]  873,000,000 and now
[35:10.580 --> 35:12.320]  this is going up against
[35:12.320 --> 35:14.160]  Dark Knight Rises
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.500]  from 2012. That's gotta be more, surely.
[35:16.500 --> 35:18.600]  It has to be more, right?
[35:19.140 --> 35:20.500]  Yep. Billion.
[35:20.760 --> 35:21.340]  One of the six.
[35:22.600 --> 35:24.740]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.
[35:24.960 --> 35:26.560]  You know that moment when you just need to hit
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.620]  pause and refresh? An ice
[35:28.620 --> 35:30.180]  cold Diet Coke isn't just a break.
[35:30.400 --> 35:32.660]  It's your chance to catch your breath and savor a moment
[35:32.660 --> 35:34.440]  that's all about you. Always
[35:34.440 --> 35:36.420]  refreshing, still the same great taste.
[35:36.960 --> 35:38.740]  Diet Coke. Make time for you time.
[35:41.020 --> 35:42.620]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino
[35:43.020 --> 35:44.300]  blended beverage at Starbucks.
[35:44.300 --> 35:45.900]  It's the classic blended
[35:45.900 --> 35:48.140]  iced coffee you know and love, now topped
[35:48.140 --> 35:50.080]  with a creamy layer of handcrafted
[35:50.080 --> 35:51.900]  brown sugar cold foam. Available
[35:51.900 --> 35:54.360]  for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino
[35:54.360 --> 35:55.440]  is ready at Starbucks.
[35:55.880 --> 35:57.880]  Ooh, Spectre. Is that the Bond movie?
[35:58.140 --> 36:00.120]  Jimmy Bond. Yes. Jimmy
[36:00.120 --> 36:02.060]  Bond. This is the direct sequel
[36:02.060 --> 36:04.020]  to Skyfall. It has to be less
[36:04.020 --> 36:05.640]  than a billion, right? I would think so.
[36:05.900 --> 36:07.680]  These all start getting muddy
[36:07.680 --> 36:09.960]  for me when it's like Skyfall and
[36:09.960 --> 36:12.060]  Spectre and the last three that he's
[36:12.060 --> 36:13.960]  in, like all of that, I just don't know.
[36:14.280 --> 36:15.820]  I'd say less. They're connected
[36:15.820 --> 36:18.120]  somehow, I don't really understand. He had three
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.000]  good movies and two shit stains
[36:20.000 --> 36:21.880]  and this is a shit stain. This is a shit stain
[36:21.880 --> 36:24.040]  so it probably fell short of a
[36:24.040 --> 36:25.280]  billion. I would think so.
[36:25.820 --> 36:28.060]  Oh, I don't know though. What's everyone's
[36:28.060 --> 36:29.680]  thoughts? I think it's less.
[36:29.700 --> 36:32.040]  I think it's less, but you're the James Bond guy.
[36:32.320 --> 36:34.000]  Nah, it was a bit of a pants one.
[36:34.140 --> 36:35.800]  It was just a bit pants. It was pants.
[36:36.200 --> 36:37.680]  Here it is. Less.
[36:38.900 --> 36:39.260]  Oh!
[36:39.260 --> 36:41.280]  Oh, $880 million.
[36:41.920 --> 36:43.160]  Well, the war effort
[36:43.160 --> 36:44.760]  is strong in 1939.
[36:45.840 --> 36:47.260]  The Wizard of Oz is
[36:47.260 --> 36:48.260]  in theaters. Did it make
[36:49.620 --> 36:51.320]  Spectre money? $880 million.
[36:51.520 --> 36:52.640]  I'm gonna say it was just...
[36:52.640 --> 36:55.420]  Honestly, $870
[36:55.420 --> 36:57.040]  maybe for Wizard of Oz.
[36:57.300 --> 36:59.320]  Maybe. I think it's gonna fall just short
[36:59.320 --> 37:01.100]  of Spectre. Just slightly.
[37:01.640 --> 37:02.900]  Okay, let's go less. Barely.
[37:03.320 --> 37:05.000]  Oh, $26 million. Close.
[37:05.520 --> 37:06.500]  Oh shit.
[37:06.500 --> 37:07.900]  Oh. I would say less.
[37:08.320 --> 37:10.620]  Yeah, I think it's less. El Mariachi 1992
[37:11.040 --> 37:12.600]  versus Wizard of Oz is
[37:12.600 --> 37:13.760]  $26 million.
[37:14.320 --> 37:16.580]  I have no idea. I haven't seen that. I'd go less.
[37:16.880 --> 37:18.520]  If we get this right, we'll be
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.580]  at $30. We'll be doubling our high score.
[37:20.700 --> 37:22.600]  That could be gold. That has to be gold.
[37:22.980 --> 37:24.400]  It has to be. Who was in this movie?
[37:24.840 --> 37:26.620]  You've never seen El Mariachi? Robert Rodriguez's
[37:26.620 --> 37:28.360]  movie? It's Antonio Banderas, right?
[37:28.620 --> 37:30.560]  This is like... Yeah. Yeah, his first movie.
[37:30.720 --> 37:32.200]  No, this is... He's not in it.
[37:32.600 --> 37:34.580]  Really? No, Antonio Banderas
[37:34.580 --> 37:36.740]  shows up in Desperado, which is the sequel
[37:36.740 --> 37:38.020]  to this movie. Got it.
[37:38.200 --> 37:40.620]  I think everybody in this is unknown. I think it has to be
[37:40.620 --> 37:42.740]  less. It's like Clerks was like $4 million.
[37:42.900 --> 37:44.460]  I think it's going to be the same thing. Yeah.
[37:44.780 --> 37:46.800]  Oh, right. Like double. Single figures.
[37:47.360 --> 37:48.440]  There you go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[37:48.440 --> 37:50.420]  $2 million. Wow. The Gentleman
[37:50.420 --> 37:52.660]  2019. Guy Ritchie? I saw this movie in theaters.
[37:52.980 --> 37:54.480]  So did I. Guy Ritchie joint.
[37:54.700 --> 37:56.680]  I don't think Guy Ritchie could make $2 million
[37:56.680 --> 37:58.660]  if he tried. No, I don't think he could.
[37:58.660 --> 38:00.080]  He could probably just film
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.580]  like a bunch of turds landing on a
[38:02.580 --> 38:04.460]  newspaper for 90 minutes and it would somehow
[38:04.460 --> 38:06.440]  make more than $2 million. Yeah. I mean, just
[38:06.440 --> 38:07.820]  in the UK, it would like
[38:07.820 --> 38:09.980]  go crazy. So
[38:10.460 --> 38:12.360]  I'm going to say more. It would just be Jason
[38:12.360 --> 38:14.020]  Statham shitting. Yeah.
[38:14.340 --> 38:16.160]  Hey, where's my Rock and Roller 2?
[38:16.720 --> 38:18.560]  Come on. I know. They said there'd be
[38:18.560 --> 38:20.680]  a part 2. That is the funniest
[38:20.680 --> 38:22.360]  thing. That movie ends.
[38:22.440 --> 38:24.460]  They'll be back. Like, what's
[38:24.460 --> 38:26.460]  his name? Like Bugsy and the Crew will be
[38:26.460 --> 38:28.700]  back in like real Rock and Roller
[38:28.700 --> 38:30.860]  or whatever. It's so... Rock and Roller
[38:30.860 --> 38:32.800]  Forever. It's so goofy. What was that like
[38:32.800 --> 38:34.940]  2008 or something? Yeah, I loved that
[38:34.940 --> 38:36.980]  movie. Oh, I like Rock and Roller.
[38:36.980 --> 38:38.660]  I think it's a lot of fun. But
[38:38.660 --> 38:40.620]  we got The Gentleman. I like The Gentleman.
[38:40.800 --> 38:42.880]  I thought that was really good. Colin Farrell
[38:42.880 --> 38:44.780]  is so good in it. Charlie Hunnam, great. I thought
[38:44.780 --> 38:46.260]  Matthew McConaughey was a lot of fun in it too.
[38:46.940 --> 38:48.420]  Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant was great.
[38:49.080 --> 38:50.860]  He had like a weird little accent. He's like
[38:50.860 --> 38:52.460]  a little rat man. He's got a weird little accent.
[38:52.740 --> 38:54.700]  He went like full Cockney, didn't he?
[38:54.880 --> 38:56.320]  He did. Yeah, he's...
[38:56.320 --> 38:58.680]  He keeps calling him like Waymond
[38:58.680 --> 39:00.540]  instead of Raymond. Like he says all of his R's
[39:00.540 --> 39:02.460]  and W's for like no reason. It's very weird.
[39:02.640 --> 39:04.460]  It's like a little bit of a Jonathan Ross.
[39:04.940 --> 39:06.560]  Oh, yeah. Oh, it is Jonathan
[39:06.560 --> 39:08.520]  Ross. Yeah. It's so funny. A little bit
[39:08.520 --> 39:09.260]  wibbly wobbly.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.780]  Toy Story. More. More.
[39:13.000 --> 39:14.660]  Definitely more. 404 million.
[39:14.820 --> 39:16.540]  Amazing Spider-Man from 2012.
[39:16.960 --> 39:18.660]  404. Definitely more. I felt like
[39:18.660 --> 39:20.420]  people were pumped for this movie. Absolutely.
[39:20.800 --> 39:22.620]  Spider-Man is crazy. Yeah.
[39:22.660 --> 39:24.760]  People love Spider-Man. I've never seen this movie.
[39:25.020 --> 39:26.500]  Neither have I. Oh, me neither. No.
[39:26.500 --> 39:28.300]  Way more. Absolutely. Oh, yeah.
[39:29.100 --> 39:29.900]  757. Oh!
[39:31.260 --> 39:32.260]  Okay, now here's
[39:32.260 --> 39:34.460]  the thing. Amazing Spider-Man 2012.
[39:34.960 --> 39:35.700]  757 million
[39:36.260 --> 39:37.780]  versus Bad Boys for Life
[39:39.580 --> 39:40.380]  2020. That's
[39:40.380 --> 39:42.400]  COVID time. Yeah, I think less.
[39:42.600 --> 39:44.420]  I think it would be a summer release, so yeah, I think
[39:44.420 --> 39:46.400]  it would be less. And how did they waste
[39:46.400 --> 39:48.480]  that title on the third one instead of
[39:48.480 --> 39:49.940]  the fourth one? Crazy.
[39:50.520 --> 39:52.020]  Alright, here we go. Less.
[39:52.420 --> 39:54.000]  I guess they didn't think they were going to make another one.
[39:54.000 --> 39:54.720]  Wait, wait.
[39:55.560 --> 39:56.240]  Okay, good.
[39:56.820 --> 39:58.560]  I was about to question the whole thing.
[40:00.060 --> 40:01.020]  419 million
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.360]  versus Star Wars The Force Awakens.
[40:03.580 --> 40:04.780]  That's going to be one of the six.
[40:05.200 --> 40:06.500]  Yeah, it's one of the six.
[40:07.320 --> 40:08.900]  I think this made pretty good money.
[40:09.340 --> 40:10.360]  Two billion.
[40:11.460 --> 40:13.640]  Now, before we start getting up over
[40:13.640 --> 40:15.880]  our skis, Star Wars Force Awakens
[40:15.880 --> 40:17.820]  $2 billion versus Little Women
[40:17.820 --> 40:19.580]  2019. I like it. It's less.
[40:19.900 --> 40:20.960]  It's definitely less.
[40:20.960 --> 40:22.900]  Eric, what's your personal high score
[40:22.900 --> 40:24.760]  on this? Oh, I stopped
[40:24.760 --> 40:27.000]  playing. That was the first time I ever
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.100]  saw the end. I only played it like eight in a row.
[40:29.380 --> 40:31.220]  And then I went, oh, okay, cool, I got it.
[40:31.400 --> 40:32.980]  That amount there on the left was
[40:32.980 --> 40:34.940]  I think why Disney
[40:34.940 --> 40:37.060]  went, oh, we should do this every
[40:37.060 --> 40:38.880]  single year now. Yes.
[40:39.100 --> 40:40.560]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[40:40.960 --> 40:43.160]  And the world got bored.
[40:43.600 --> 40:44.760]  And then they ruined it.
[40:45.320 --> 40:47.160]  Yep. Okay, Little Women, less.
[40:47.480 --> 40:49.120]  Great. Bob Odenkirk being the dad
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.160]  in that movie really throws you off. Crazy.
[40:51.540 --> 40:53.080]  I think it's so funny. Yep. I think that's
[40:53.080 --> 40:55.140]  great. Yep. Oh, this is interesting.
[40:55.280 --> 40:56.760]  Now, Us, 2019,
[40:57.060 --> 40:58.980]  did it cross $200 million? I mean,
[40:59.060 --> 41:00.940]  it was coming off of Get Out
[41:00.940 --> 41:03.260]  Hype, which was a
[41:03.260 --> 41:04.460]  good movie, and Us
[41:04.460 --> 41:06.220]  was a bad movie.
[41:07.080 --> 41:08.620]  I think this, I think
[41:09.140 --> 41:10.340]  Us probably did $400.
[41:11.100 --> 41:12.480]  I take that. Yeah.
[41:13.860 --> 41:14.960]  Oh, wow!
[41:15.600 --> 41:17.440]  Wow, that was close!
[41:17.900 --> 41:19.700]  Jumanji definitely did more. This did more.
[41:20.060 --> 41:21.460]  This potentially going head-to-head.
[41:21.640 --> 41:23.420]  Also, Jumanji, the next level from 2019.
[41:23.820 --> 41:25.360]  Was this the second one
[41:25.360 --> 41:26.780]  that they did, or the...
[41:27.500 --> 41:29.480]  I'm not sure. It makes sense if it was
[41:29.480 --> 41:31.360]  the sequel, right? Because the next level.
[41:31.800 --> 41:33.080]  Man, movies make a lot of money.
[41:33.460 --> 41:34.760]  We're deep in the 2019
[41:35.280 --> 41:37.500]  trenches, because now we have Jumanji, the next
[41:37.500 --> 41:39.440]  level, at $796 million versus
[41:40.340 --> 41:41.640]  1917 from 2019.
[41:41.800 --> 41:43.320]  That movie was cool. Less.
[41:43.320 --> 41:45.220]  I'd say less, though. It's gotta be less, right? Yep.
[41:45.220 --> 41:47.860]  It was marketed so much...
[41:47.860 --> 41:49.140]  Oh, this one was Jumanji, though. It was.
[41:49.600 --> 41:51.100]  It was. I just don't think it did
[41:51.100 --> 41:53.280]  better than Jumanji. Less.
[41:54.160 --> 41:54.560]  Okay.
[41:55.240 --> 41:56.620]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool.
[41:57.180 --> 41:58.900]  Okay, well. Oh, shit.
[41:59.200 --> 42:01.240]  Come on. Now, do you think... Right, but do you think
[42:01.240 --> 42:03.240]  Avengers Endgame did more than Little Women?
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.240]  So, this is more.
[42:06.220 --> 42:07.240]  Did this cross $2 billion?
[42:07.840 --> 42:08.800]  Did it cross $3 billion?
[42:09.360 --> 42:11.320]  Yeah, right? Like, it's insane, right?
[42:12.240 --> 42:13.480]  Whoa! It was close!
[42:13.480 --> 42:13.560]  It was.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.980]  $2,797,000,000
[42:18.980 --> 42:19.860]  against
[42:19.860 --> 42:21.400]  Forrest Gump from 1994.
[42:21.840 --> 42:23.180]  Life is like an Infinity Gauntlet.
[42:26.500 --> 42:29.800]  Let's go less. Never know which stone you're gonna get.
[42:31.080 --> 42:33.980]  Ooh, I don't know what this is.
[42:34.020 --> 42:34.780]  It's dog shit.
[42:34.920 --> 42:37.040]  The James Franco... Yeah, I think less.
[42:37.820 --> 42:38.160]  Less.
[42:39.500 --> 42:41.280]  Yeah, I'd still say less.
[42:41.740 --> 42:43.080]  Less than Forrest Gump.
[42:43.280 --> 42:45.580]  Gump at $678,000,000.
[42:46.060 --> 42:47.840]  Oz the Great and Powerful, you're gonna say less.
[42:48.100 --> 42:49.000]  Yeah, I'm gonna say less.
[42:49.660 --> 42:51.740]  Gavin? Sure, I have no idea about this movie.
[42:52.120 --> 42:53.480]  I don't know anything about this movie.
[42:53.780 --> 42:54.760]  I didn't know it got made.
[42:54.940 --> 42:56.880]  I don't remember it doing well at all.
[42:57.340 --> 42:59.240]  Uh, okay. Less. Here we go.
[42:59.880 --> 43:01.080]  Wow! Not much less.
[43:01.920 --> 43:03.620]  $493,000,000 versus The Hobbit,
[43:03.760 --> 43:05.700]  The Battle of the Five Armies
[43:05.700 --> 43:07.100]  from 2014. The third one.
[43:07.440 --> 43:08.620]  The third one. More.
[43:08.620 --> 43:09.480]  More.
[43:10.140 --> 43:13.040]  Easily more. We've already kind of previewed The Hobbit.
[43:13.120 --> 43:14.240]  I think we can lock in more.
[43:14.940 --> 43:15.760]  Gavin? Yeah.
[43:19.740 --> 43:20.240]  $956,000.
[43:20.460 --> 43:22.660]  The Artist, which had the dog.
[43:22.780 --> 43:23.940]  There's a black and white dog.
[43:24.440 --> 43:25.560]  That's all I know from it.
[43:25.660 --> 43:27.700]  It's a silent film, so I'm gonna say less.
[43:27.940 --> 43:29.860]  It's a silent film from 2011.
[43:30.200 --> 43:31.440]  I'm gonna guess less.
[43:31.940 --> 43:32.660]  Yeah, I'd say less.
[43:33.020 --> 43:35.780]  Saw it in theaters with maybe seven other old people.
[43:35.780 --> 43:36.280]  Yeah.
[43:38.400 --> 43:39.140]  $133,000,000.
[43:39.300 --> 43:41.960]  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 2019.
[43:42.440 --> 43:43.840]  Probably just a little bit more.
[43:44.200 --> 43:45.480]  Didn't see it though. It's great.
[43:45.800 --> 43:47.480]  I liked it. I mean, I don't love that.
[43:47.560 --> 43:49.580]  It's definitely not my favorite Tarantino movie, but
[43:49.580 --> 43:51.100]  there are moments of it that I really like.
[43:51.180 --> 43:52.720]  Is that the last one he did? Yep.
[43:53.040 --> 43:55.580]  Uh, Friday the 13th, 1980.
[43:56.040 --> 43:57.520]  Less. Yeah, less.
[43:57.980 --> 43:59.180]  Do you think it was $20,000,000?
[43:59.740 --> 44:01.720]  Uh, yeah. I mean, we got early
[44:01.720 --> 44:03.180]  Kevin Bacon in it.
[44:04.080 --> 44:05.080]  I think the hype
[44:05.080 --> 44:07.220]  was that it was making people sick in the
[44:07.220 --> 44:08.920]  theater or whatever. Undercooked bacon?
[44:09.440 --> 44:10.860]  It was uncooked bacon.
[44:11.300 --> 44:13.080]  Uh, here we go. People were scared.
[44:13.240 --> 44:15.260]  Wow! Good for them. $39,000,000.
[44:15.760 --> 44:17.300]  Ooh, The Irishman, which was a
[44:17.300 --> 44:19.200]  Netflix... wasn't that like a Netflix release?
[44:19.580 --> 44:20.680]  It's a Netflix movie.
[44:21.040 --> 44:23.160]  Wasn't it like three and something hours long
[44:23.160 --> 44:24.620]  or something? Yeah, it was. It was really long.
[44:24.920 --> 44:27.140]  And they did a lot of CG to make
[44:27.140 --> 44:29.100]  young them. Yeah, yeah, dude.
[44:29.180 --> 44:30.720]  And it worked so well.
[44:30.720 --> 44:32.780]  He looked so young in the movie,
[44:32.780 --> 44:34.820]  dude. It worked. When he was walking
[44:34.820 --> 44:36.820]  around, I went, whoa, this is a young De Niro
[44:36.820 --> 44:39.000]  for sure. Like, I can definitely
[44:39.000 --> 44:40.880]  look at how young
[44:40.880 --> 44:42.480]  he looks is what I kept saying out loud.
[44:42.640 --> 44:44.600]  Look at that old man walk on a young man's body.
[44:44.940 --> 44:46.660]  It's gotta be more.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.720]  Even if it's on Netflix? But it
[44:48.720 --> 44:50.960]  still had a theatrical release and it was...
[44:50.960 --> 44:52.560]  Alright, yeah. I would go...
[44:52.560 --> 44:54.940]  I would go less. Oh my god.
[44:55.180 --> 44:56.700]  You think it would be less? My vote
[44:56.700 --> 44:58.500]  is for less. Damn.
[44:58.500 --> 45:00.320]  But just mainly because it was
[45:01.140 --> 45:02.560]  streamed? Yeah, I think it
[45:02.560 --> 45:04.140]  was largely watched on Netflix.
[45:04.580 --> 45:06.480]  I would say less, yeah. Okay.
[45:06.860 --> 45:08.600]  Gavin, do you say more
[45:08.600 --> 45:10.600]  or less? I think
[45:10.600 --> 45:12.520]  it fulfilled the obligations you
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.700]  need to be nominated for an Oscar as far
[45:14.700 --> 45:16.520]  as theatrical goes, but I don't
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.340]  think 40 million
[45:18.340 --> 45:20.280]  dollars worth of people saw
[45:20.280 --> 45:21.940]  The Irishman in theaters.
[45:22.580 --> 45:24.100]  Alright, I'll go along with it.
[45:24.600 --> 45:26.540]  Alright, less it is. Will it be
[45:26.540 --> 45:28.300]  less? Our streak's at 46 so far.
[45:28.780 --> 45:30.740]  39 million is what we have to be with The Irishman.
[45:30.880 --> 45:31.700]  We're saying less.
[45:32.480 --> 45:33.520]  Holy shit!
[45:36.780 --> 45:37.820]  $968,000?!
[45:37.820 --> 45:38.620]  It's probably in like
[45:38.620 --> 45:40.340]  10 theaters. Wow!
[45:40.900 --> 45:42.440]  More. Okay.
[45:42.780 --> 45:44.180]  Now, did Avatar
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.500]  from 2009 make more than
[45:47.120 --> 45:48.700]  968- did it break 1 million?
[45:48.840 --> 45:50.320]  I don't remember. I'm gonna guess
[45:50.320 --> 45:51.880]  at least 1,000 times more.
[45:52.440 --> 45:52.800]  Okay.
[45:54.680 --> 45:55.980]  Oh my god.
[45:56.520 --> 45:56.960]  Okay.
[45:57.140 --> 45:59.220]  2,700 times more.
[46:02.740 --> 46:03.900]  We're never gonna die.
[46:04.660 --> 46:04.720]  Avatar.
[46:05.100 --> 46:07.780]  $2,790,000
[46:07.780 --> 46:09.700]  versus Fast & Furious Hobbs & Shaw
[46:09.700 --> 46:11.600]  which I think
[46:11.600 --> 46:12.820]  I saw in theaters with you, Gavin.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.740]  Did we see it at Dbox? Yeah.
[46:14.900 --> 46:16.440]  I wanted to like it so much.
[46:16.800 --> 46:18.260]  Oh yeah, I wanted to like this movie.
[46:18.480 --> 46:20.940]  There's so many cool guy things individually
[46:20.940 --> 46:22.480]  in this movie, but it just sucks.
[46:22.900 --> 46:25.260]  It was when they were trying to like pull a helicopter
[46:25.260 --> 46:26.920]  down to the ground by
[46:26.920 --> 46:28.420]  driving faster. Yes.
[46:28.660 --> 46:30.300]  And then like the rock holds it.
[46:30.640 --> 46:32.880]  I think my favorite is him running down
[46:32.880 --> 46:35.000]  the side of a building and firing his gun to slow
[46:35.000 --> 46:36.420]  down his speed. Yeah. It's great.
[46:36.680 --> 46:39.280]  There's so many like individual cool things.
[46:40.060 --> 46:40.240]  Yep.
[46:40.800 --> 46:43.080]  Definitely less. It still did great.
[46:43.380 --> 46:45.900]  Wow. $759,000,000.
[46:46.480 --> 46:47.440]  Chronicles of Narnia
[46:47.440 --> 46:48.660]  Prince Caspian.
[46:49.420 --> 46:50.820]  Less. Less.
[46:51.500 --> 46:51.720]  Yeah.
[46:52.620 --> 46:54.360]  Has to be, right? Yeah, definitely less.
[46:55.760 --> 46:56.480]  $419,000,000.
[46:56.540 --> 46:57.800]  Captain Marvel 2019.
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.400]  Did it cross the $419,000,000 mark?
[47:01.880 --> 47:02.580]  I bet it crossed
[47:02.580 --> 47:04.540]  a billion, but it was the beginning of the end.
[47:05.060 --> 47:05.760]  Yeah? You think
[47:06.600 --> 47:08.900]  Captain Marvel's a billion? You think it's one of the six?
[47:09.320 --> 47:10.640]  I think it could be one of the six.
[47:10.980 --> 47:12.440]  Oh, I don't know. We're running out of room
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.480]  on the six. We at least have
[47:14.480 --> 47:16.280]  seven so far in the six. I don't know
[47:16.280 --> 47:18.460]  if we're going to sneak another one in.
[47:18.960 --> 47:20.020]  Wouldn't this be between
[47:20.020 --> 47:21.400]  Infinity War and
[47:21.900 --> 47:23.740]  Endgame? Yes. It is, yeah.
[47:23.940 --> 47:26.240]  I think it's more. It's got to be one of the six.
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.480]  But I don't think it's a billion.
[47:28.420 --> 47:30.100]  Okay. More it is.
[47:30.160 --> 47:31.880]  Here we go. It's a billion.
[47:32.580 --> 47:35.400]  I'm just kidding. $1,128,000,000.
[47:36.540 --> 47:38.060]  Twilight. We're going to go ahead and just go
[47:38.060 --> 47:39.020]  less. Less.
[47:40.440 --> 47:41.500]  Cool. $408,000,000.
[47:41.840 --> 47:44.120]  Spongebob movie 2004. I have no fucking
[47:44.120 --> 47:45.880]  idea. Oh, no. No clue.
[47:46.440 --> 47:48.240]  No clue. Our streak
[47:48.240 --> 47:50.140]  right now? 52. I'd say less.
[47:50.420 --> 47:51.580]  I feel good about the streak.
[47:52.180 --> 47:54.000]  2004? Was it
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.340]  still popular on TV in 2004?
[47:56.780 --> 47:58.360]  Yeah, it was. I was a kid then.
[47:58.580 --> 48:00.220]  I think it was popular on TV past
[48:00.220 --> 48:02.060]  2008. I never liked
[48:02.060 --> 48:04.140]  Spongebob, but I went to a Spongebob
[48:04.140 --> 48:05.860]  birthday party where we watched this
[48:05.860 --> 48:07.840]  in a packed theater. Oh, wow.
[48:08.260 --> 48:10.280]  So do you think it did more? I mean, kid shit
[48:10.280 --> 48:11.780]  does deceptively well.
[48:11.780 --> 48:12.480]  Yeah.
[48:13.740 --> 48:15.820]  I mean, it was definitely a big
[48:15.820 --> 48:17.900]  deal still as a kid
[48:17.900 --> 48:18.620]  then.
[48:19.080 --> 48:21.880]  I think it did well,
[48:21.920 --> 48:22.860]  but I don't think it did
[48:23.860 --> 48:25.980]  more than Twilight. I'm 10,
[48:26.100 --> 48:27.300]  so I have no read on this
[48:27.300 --> 48:29.840]  in any way. I was still too
[48:29.840 --> 48:32.100]  scared to watch Shaun of the Dead at this age.
[48:32.220 --> 48:33.420]  Distinctively. 2004.
[48:35.840 --> 48:37.900]  So we're going to go less? I'm going to go less.
[48:38.280 --> 48:39.640]  Okay. Here we go. Less.
[48:39.640 --> 48:41.880]  408 million. This might break us.
[48:42.700 --> 48:42.960]  Oh!
[48:44.040 --> 48:45.460]  141 million versus
[48:45.460 --> 48:47.120]  the Lion King 2019.
[48:47.760 --> 48:49.260]  Lion King. More. Yeah.
[48:49.380 --> 48:51.700]  Yeah, I guess way more. Has to be more, right?
[48:51.820 --> 48:53.640]  Yeah, this is still before
[48:53.640 --> 48:55.580]  people were sick of it. Holy shit!
[48:56.140 --> 48:57.280]  It's one of the six.
[48:58.900 --> 48:59.860]  1.656.
[49:00.340 --> 49:01.240]  That's insane.
[49:01.560 --> 49:03.840]  But, Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring.
[49:04.160 --> 49:05.640]  I mean, it deserves to have made
[49:05.640 --> 49:07.480]  more, but... I would say less. I don't think it did.
[49:07.480 --> 49:09.600]  I assume less. I would think less.
[49:10.020 --> 49:10.880]  Wow, isn't that insane?
[49:13.180 --> 49:14.300]  187 million.
[49:14.620 --> 49:15.740]  Versus 2012
[49:15.740 --> 49:17.020]  from 2009.
[49:17.900 --> 49:19.360]  It is really funny to see
[49:19.360 --> 49:20.720]  2012, 2009.
[49:23.140 --> 49:23.700]  Aka,
[49:23.820 --> 49:25.440]  I'm glad I'm not where I was
[49:25.440 --> 49:26.980]  10 feet ago, the movie. Yeah.
[49:27.840 --> 49:29.280]  Absolutely. Great joke by Jack. Less.
[49:29.780 --> 49:31.180]  Definitely less, right? Great Jack joke.
[49:32.620 --> 49:33.460]  Great way to go,
[49:33.520 --> 49:34.760]  Jack. Less.
[49:34.760 --> 49:35.900]  It's less, yeah.
[49:36.380 --> 49:37.180]  Significantly less.
[49:40.560 --> 49:41.800]  Good for Roland.
[49:43.740 --> 49:44.660]  791 million.
[49:45.020 --> 49:46.180]  Versus Incredibles 2.
[49:46.300 --> 49:48.080]  Do you remember? I don't.
[49:48.320 --> 49:50.380]  It was better. It was more, right? Isn't that how we lost?
[49:50.880 --> 49:51.720]  Yeah, that's how we lost.
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.260]  It's gotta be more. Yeah.
[49:54.440 --> 49:55.560]  More? Yeah. More.
[49:56.180 --> 49:59.240]  More. Yeah. 1,242,000,000.
[49:59.240 --> 49:59.620]  Oh, shit.
[49:59.940 --> 50:01.540]  That is impossible.
[50:01.540 --> 50:02.900]  Uh-oh. No, more.
[50:03.220 --> 50:03.580]  Way more.
[50:05.600 --> 50:06.820]  Once again, I go,
[50:06.900 --> 50:09.380]  Incredibles 2, that made less, but that's not the game we're playing.
[50:09.500 --> 50:11.800]  More. You think way more though?
[50:12.120 --> 50:13.780]  I think it is because they made another sequel.
[50:14.580 --> 50:15.380]  Yeah, this movie
[50:15.380 --> 50:17.300]  is so big. 1.5
[50:17.300 --> 50:18.780]  bill is what I'm saying.
[50:19.040 --> 50:21.660]  I know it's big, but I think you're underestimating how big
[50:21.660 --> 50:23.240]  1.2 billion is.
[50:23.980 --> 50:25.020]  No, it's huge.
[50:25.580 --> 50:27.660]  Absolutely huge. I think 3 was big.
[50:28.260 --> 50:29.460]  Gavin, do you say more or less?
[50:29.460 --> 50:31.340]  I bet it's
[50:31.340 --> 50:33.160]  one of the six, but I bet it's less.
[50:34.240 --> 50:35.600]  Oh, you think it is less?
[50:35.780 --> 50:36.600]  But I'm outvoted.
[50:37.320 --> 50:38.660]  More it is. Here we go.
[50:39.320 --> 50:39.740]  We lost!
[50:41.980 --> 50:43.880]  1,066,000,000
[50:43.880 --> 50:45.180]  gold medal.
[50:45.900 --> 50:46.420]  Impressive.
[50:48.200 --> 50:49.420]  Wow. We killed it.
[50:49.820 --> 50:50.780]  We did. That was great.
[50:50.960 --> 50:53.100]  57. Can you believe we saw all
[50:53.100 --> 50:54.780]  6 billion dollar movies in the quiz?
[50:55.240 --> 50:55.760]  Insane.
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.000]  Insane.
[50:58.360 --> 50:59.840]  Well, thanks
[50:59.840 --> 51:01.660]  for checking out Regulation Over Under,
[51:01.800 --> 51:03.380]  an idea I had while mowing the yard.
[51:04.460 --> 51:05.680]  Really appreciate you guys
[51:05.680 --> 51:06.720]  giving this a try.
[51:07.220 --> 51:09.680]  I feel like getting 57
[51:09.680 --> 51:11.260]  in a row as a team, great.
[51:12.100 --> 51:12.640]  And now,
[51:13.500 --> 51:15.780]  Jeff, I feel like Jeff is at a disadvantage
[51:15.780 --> 51:17.620]  going into the summer movie auction
[51:17.620 --> 51:19.120]  because he doesn't know how much movies cost.
[51:19.200 --> 51:21.800]  He has no idea. This guy is screwed,
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.460]  dude. He has no idea.
[51:24.220 --> 51:25.380]  Thanks for checking this out.

[51:31.420 --> 51:33.540]  Is that where this video went? Could be.
