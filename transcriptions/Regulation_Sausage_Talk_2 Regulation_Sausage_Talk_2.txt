[00:29.860 --> 00:36.200]  Hello and welcome to another episode of Sausage Talk. This is our second Sausage Talk. I believe
[00:36.200 --> 00:39.920]  this is coming out at the end of January the 26th or so. You know that though because you're
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.420]  listening to it on that day. Or someday later if that's the case. You don't give a shit when
[00:44.420 --> 00:51.380]  it came out. It is about 6 months, Eric says almost to the day, since the last episode of
[00:51.380 --> 00:57.200]  Sausage Talk, which would make this episode two. We just wrapped the year on regulation.
[00:57.440 --> 01:01.840]  I figured it's a good time to probably talk about it. And we're opening up 2025. It's our first
[01:01.840 --> 01:08.120]  full year as a company moving forward. And we probably have a lot to figure out. We've been
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.940]  having sidebar conversations left and right all over the place. And I think we all agree it'd be
[01:12.940 --> 01:17.140]  better if we just got in the same room and hash some stuff out. Does anybody want to start?
[01:19.760 --> 01:23.800]  I'm imagining the sidebar conversations of what you guys are having. And then it's
[01:23.800 --> 01:30.580]  me just watching a kicking montage of martial arts films. I'm not in on the sidebar. So
[01:30.580 --> 01:34.960]  wherever you want to go, sounds good to me. Well, a lot of the sidebars are related to
[01:34.960 --> 01:41.420]  content that like we have a bunch of content that we've been pitching back and forth that we could
[01:41.420 --> 01:45.940]  kind of all go over together. I will say some of those some of the content we can't talk about in
[01:45.940 --> 01:52.580]  front of everybody. And that goes in like every direction. So it's like not to usher in a new
[01:52.580 --> 01:58.960]  paranoid era or anything, but there are bits of content that we just can't discuss in front of
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.440]  all of us because some of us aren't aware of it, if that makes sense. If you had to summarize 2024
[02:05.000 --> 02:08.760]  with regulation, what was it the year of? Absolute chaos.
[02:10.200 --> 02:17.480]  It was it was the year that regulation was was born like a phoenix falcon from the ashes of
[02:18.460 --> 02:25.580]  face. It was our phoenix falcon year. I'd say born, not necessarily fully taken off yet,
[02:25.780 --> 02:30.900]  like still process of it's not as easy as they make it look on TV to fly off majestically.
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.720]  I feel like still flapping them wings a little bit, still getting into the swing of things.
[02:36.720 --> 02:42.060]  There's a period where you're hopping around somebody's backyard to the tree for a couple
[02:42.060 --> 02:46.100]  of weeks, flying like three feet in the air, then a foot and then walking for a bit and then
[02:46.100 --> 02:51.060]  making it almost up to the limb and then fall. Yeah, we're I think we got to the lowest rung of
[02:51.060 --> 02:55.120]  the limb. We're not bouncing around the yard anymore. But yeah, we definitely have gone
[02:55.120 --> 03:01.140]  through that. We, you know, hold on a second. Yeah, my wings stretch out now. I feel like I
[03:01.140 --> 03:07.920]  fly a little bit. A phoenix isn't real, right? Uh, so where do you? Okay, hang on. This rocks.
[03:08.140 --> 03:11.920]  Uh, this is great. Where do you think a phoenix lives? Is it like the werewolves of New Mexico
[03:11.920 --> 03:15.500]  or where do you think a phoenix lives? I was thinking, yeah, I was thinking like a sandy
[03:15.500 --> 03:22.620]  climate. Sandy? Yeah, I think maybe because of Flight of the Phoenix, the movie that may have me
[03:23.140 --> 03:29.860]  thinking of sand. I associate a phoenix with fire and I associate fire with heat and ash and sand.
[03:29.860 --> 03:33.660]  So I'm right there with you. I think of a phoenix living in the desert. That's not a lot of fires
[03:33.660 --> 03:38.560]  in the desert though. You're just not out there. Okay. Yeah. How often are you in the desert?
[03:38.800 --> 03:44.400]  When was the last time you visited the desert? Uh, filmed in deserts. You also have to think
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.980]  maybe there were a lot of fires in the desert and that's why it's a desert. Oh, it's all ash.
[03:50.400 --> 03:55.800]  I think the desert was at one time the wettest place and now it's the driest place. Something
[03:55.800 --> 03:59.460]  to think about, I guess. I don't even know where to begin with that. I don't think the desert
[03:59.460 --> 04:07.940]  was wetter than the other ocean. The what? Yeah. So we have a company now somehow. I think Gavin's
[04:07.940 --> 04:12.140]  saying it's not wetter. I think he's saying it was at best as wet. It was as wet. Yeah.
[04:13.940 --> 04:18.880]  Uh, yeah. So listen, let's, we're talking about fucking mythical creatures and fucking
[04:19.680 --> 04:26.060]  desert oceans. So it is mythical. Okay. Jesus Christ, guys. Uh, yeah. We just,
[04:26.060 --> 04:33.060]  seriously though, we just, we launched regulation on May 11th, 2024, and it is now January 17th.
[04:33.080 --> 04:39.840]  This comes out, whatever Eric said, the 26th. So, uh, we have a lot of, uh, a lot of company
[04:39.840 --> 04:46.440]  under our belt now. We successfully launched the product. The audience supported us overwhelmingly,
[04:46.480 --> 04:52.040]  the comment leavers and the regulation listeners, uh, of the world and, uh, have helped give us this,
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.960]  uh, this runway so that we can then build the company up and move forward. And we've been taking
[04:56.960 --> 05:05.080]  it in a very meticulous stair-step approach. There is an extreme, I guess, urge to want to
[05:05.080 --> 05:10.560]  run out of the gate as fast as we can in a direction. And I think a lot of that comes from,
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.940]  A, from the enthusiasm of what we're doing, but B, also we were running at full speed before
[05:16.940 --> 05:22.360]  Rooster Teeth shit the bed, right? And so we, there's a, there's a, there's a extreme, uh,
[05:22.360 --> 05:28.740]  urge to get back to that speed because we've already run at that speed as a podcast. And the
[05:28.740 --> 05:33.560]  hard thing for me has been, and I don't know about y'all, but one of the hard things for me has been
[05:33.560 --> 05:37.620]  knowing that that's not the way to do it and that's not the right way to go and that we can't
[05:37.620 --> 05:44.720]  flip from face to regulation one-to-one. We have to now, as an independent entity, build the
[05:44.720 --> 05:49.820]  business behind regulation up so that it is healthy and that it can support us and the product
[05:49.820 --> 05:56.420]  going forward. And so I would say we are, uh, we're not running yet, but we're fucking, I got
[05:56.420 --> 06:02.160]  my jogging pants on. Oh, it's how I feel. I feel like I'm, I'm stretching a lot. I've been getting
[06:02.160 --> 06:06.580]  into shape. I've been thinking about running a lot. You know, I, I subscribed to a fucking,
[06:06.640 --> 06:11.880]  uh, a website. And so I get like daily runner's tips, you know, and I bought a new pair of shoes
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.360]  and, uh, I've been wearing the jogging shorts around the house so that I get, you know,
[06:16.380 --> 06:19.520]  so they feel comfortable. So I'm ready, but I haven't, I haven't gone outside and actually run
[06:19.520 --> 06:23.500]  yet. I feel like that's where we are. You're just dressed for it and you're stretching and stuff.
[06:23.600 --> 06:28.380]  You're just not actually doing that. I've eliminated every excuse to running at this
[06:28.380 --> 06:32.120]  point other than running. Right. I feel like that's where we are as a company. I do like that
[06:32.120 --> 06:38.280]  we've got pretty much to where we were content wise before it all went tits up, but we've not,
[06:38.280 --> 06:42.480]  we've not got any of the bloat and it's just a very efficient machine right now.
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.000]  And it's nice that we've been baby stepping our dicks off instead of just good full tilt
[06:47.520 --> 06:52.520]  aimlessly. I totally agree. And listen, we're a, we're a group of guys with baby dicks already.
[06:52.520 --> 06:58.520]  So it makes sense that we would baby step them. Uh, I think it's also just like we have a machine,
[06:58.620 --> 07:02.640]  but it's still figuring out the machine to be even more efficient. I think there's a lot of
[07:02.640 --> 07:06.960]  room for efficiency and just building off of what we've done so far. So that's something that we
[07:06.960 --> 07:10.640]  definitely should talk about today. And I would like to talk about today is efficiency and
[07:10.640 --> 07:14.060]  something that we've been. And when I say we've been sidebar and stuff, a lot of the conversations
[07:14.060 --> 07:19.540]  I've been having just over the weekend when we were in Cancun and then just around town is just
[07:19.540 --> 07:25.600]  about like figuring out how to improve the efficiency and reduce the gap between when we
[07:25.600 --> 07:29.720]  release content from when we record it. Sometimes some content, some content, it doesn't matter,
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.340]  but there are, there are pieces of content. Like we just put out the snake eyes unboxing,
[07:34.340 --> 07:38.460]  which was a great video. And I thought Gabby did a great job editing it, but it was, you know,
[07:38.480 --> 07:44.940]  six months or so after we recorded it, maybe five. And I think the audience, one of the sentiments I
[07:44.940 --> 07:48.820]  saw was that like, Oh, I completely forgotten about this. And that wasn't a negative comment,
[07:48.820 --> 07:52.500]  but I don't, you know, I think that's something that we want to, we want to avoid when possible,
[07:52.500 --> 07:58.380]  you know, like when you want to continue the bit while the bit is hot and fresh and matters.
[07:58.380 --> 08:02.460]  And so maybe we dive in there. I'd be happy with six weeks over six months.
[08:04.720 --> 08:08.960]  I think an interesting thing of figuring it out where you're talking about Jeff, like
[08:08.960 --> 08:13.600]  I was taking flight or I feel like it's like, we've put this car together and it's like, yeah,
[08:13.600 --> 08:16.720]  we can go. And then we realized, Oh fuck. We didn't, we didn't put in a windshield.
[08:17.100 --> 08:22.260]  Like there are all these sort of like peripheral parts that are needed, but like we can drive
[08:22.260 --> 08:27.780]  without them. And then it's realizing once you're down the street of like, Oh, we only put one
[08:28.380 --> 08:32.800]  rear view mirror in this thing. This is not, Oh boy. Okay. Oh, we got to figure that out.
[08:32.800 --> 08:35.000]  How many rear view mirrors do you think a car has?
[08:35.560 --> 08:39.460]  Uh, one, but I couldn't remember the name for the thing you look for the left to the right.
[08:41.640 --> 08:42.680]  What are those called?
[08:42.940 --> 08:43.460]  The wing mirror?
[08:43.960 --> 08:45.180]  Side view mirrors. Yeah.
[08:45.420 --> 08:49.340]  Side view. Yeah. I can remember the name of that. I know there's only one rear view.
[08:49.340 --> 08:51.500]  I mean, that is actually pretty fitting though, because we do,
[08:51.920 --> 08:57.020]  I feel like an area that we've lost out on is we have slightly less organizational people,
[08:57.240 --> 09:02.220]  less eyes on it. So we have a lot of stuff recorded that just slips through the spreadsheet
[09:02.220 --> 09:07.160]  and it's just like, Oh yeah. What happened to those Halloween GTA videos? It's just like,
[09:07.180 --> 09:11.500]  they're just not on the list for some reason. So we ended up having stuff that we
[09:11.500 --> 09:13.300]  completely forget about and remember later.
[09:13.520 --> 09:17.360]  I've been thinking a lot about this in terms of like, let's play because something that,
[09:17.480 --> 09:23.640]  I don't know, people may not have realized when we took over let's play, we at no point were ever
[09:24.120 --> 09:26.700]  less than two months ahead of schedule for everything.
[09:26.860 --> 09:27.140]  Correct.
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.360]  And we would slide things, but it was not the discussion of like, Oh wow,
[09:31.360 --> 09:35.960]  this is a few months old, did not apply. And I think it's just because we had a structure there
[09:36.400 --> 09:42.600]  that we don't currently have that I'd like to look into implementing where essentially we make
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.960]  a piece of content, we throw it on the calendar and it's there. And if we move it or if we decide
[09:47.960 --> 09:52.720]  like, you know what, this is more immediate, we're going to put it here. That action is also
[09:52.720 --> 09:57.580]  represented in, okay, well, where are we putting this then? Because it's so easy to be like,
[09:57.580 --> 10:02.420]  we just did this. We're so excited about it. Let's get this out now. Oh, we're supposed to
[10:02.420 --> 10:07.640]  release this thing. It's from a game that's like three years old. It doesn't need to necessarily
[10:07.640 --> 10:12.380]  come. It's not like there's a rush to have gameplay of this type of thing. We'll just,
[10:12.540 --> 10:16.400]  we'll put it out later. And then we just kind of forget and it's finalized. It's all done.
[10:16.460 --> 10:22.220]  It's just in the backlog. And I think having a more visual representation, I have a few,
[10:22.340 --> 10:26.280]  we would use air table and I'd love to be able to, something I've been meaning to look at
[10:26.280 --> 10:31.420]  a lot more within the past week, actually, but I just, I've been sick. So my plan for this weekend
[10:31.420 --> 10:35.720]  specifically is to expand on that a little bit. How are you feeling today, by the way? Are you,
[10:35.800 --> 10:40.740]  are you on the mend? Oh, I feel way better than I did. Yeah. I could tell yesterday when, during
[10:40.740 --> 10:44.600]  our round of recordings that you had, you had recovered to some degree because you had a lot
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.360]  of energy yesterday. You were kind of bouncing off the walls. It was great. Yeah. I, listen,
[10:49.560 --> 10:54.580]  I crashed hard in the evening. There was a repercussion for that, but yeah, I'm feeling
[10:54.580 --> 10:59.980]  way better. And it's just, it's been fun. As you said, like, these are things we want to get
[10:59.980 --> 11:04.400]  more efficient at, but they're fun problems to have. Yeah. It's like, we can do better at this.
[11:04.460 --> 11:08.560]  How can we deliver this and make it more enjoyable for the audience? And also it's just,
[11:08.560 --> 11:14.660]  as people that enjoy this work, it is the thing of like, oh, I really want to solve this. Like,
[11:14.700 --> 11:19.160]  this is the thing I'm excited to brainstorm on. Can I fully blame someone for this problem,
[11:19.200 --> 11:23.260]  by the way? Yes. Nobody's stopping you. I'd love to blame Eric for this.
[11:24.740 --> 11:31.500]  Okay. Yeah. Let's get into it. So, um, looking at the videos, no, everyone else, everyone else,
[11:31.740 --> 11:38.640]  shut up. Looking at the videos that we're, um, that we're releasing for, uh, the stuff that we've
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.240]  shot and everything, uh, would love to get those off of Gavin's phone and to an editor. So that way
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.560]  we can get them a little bit more timely. Uh, they have been hanging out with the one person who
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.040]  said they're going to edit them. And I'm not blaming you for not having time. Uh, but I am
[11:53.040 --> 11:58.620]  blaming you for having them. So if you really wanted to hand them over, put them in a drive,
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.200]  I would love to get them to an editor. We could get them all out within probably six weeks. And
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.200]  then, uh, that would solve that problem in terms of the gameplay videos. I laid out what I wanted
[12:08.200 --> 12:14.040]  to do today, which was dump the backlog and just go forward with what we have for GTA and gears.
[12:14.140 --> 12:21.280]  And I feel like I've really, I feel like I've really laid out what I've wanted to do with a
[12:21.280 --> 12:26.800]  Okay. Wild. Uh, well I edit the, uh, I edit the videos as soon as they're scheduled in. I mean,
[12:26.960 --> 12:30.580]  if you, if you, if you're like, Hey, let's put one out Sunday, it's edited for Sunday. It's ready.
[12:30.740 --> 12:35.680]  Hey, that's great to know. I've been waiting on you because I've thought that I don't want to
[12:35.680 --> 12:39.760]  overload you by putting something on the schedule that you're not ready to edit.
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.700]  There is a fear of overloading Gavin that permeates. I, yeah.
[12:43.760 --> 12:48.900]  Of all the people that I work with, I am most fearful of putting more on you because I don't
[12:48.900 --> 12:54.700]  think that's fair to you for something that we've shot that way. Well, that's appreciated,
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.340]  but every, every time we've needed one out, it's, I I've been clear if I have time or not. And, uh,
[12:59.460 --> 13:05.040]  I usually do and they've all come up. Yeah. Well, I, I define clear. Yeah. I've been,
[13:05.160 --> 13:08.660]  I've been managing you and working with you. Not that I manage you now, but I did for a while
[13:08.660 --> 13:12.600]  working with you for a long time. And I, your idea of clear and other people's idea of clear,
[13:12.600 --> 13:19.140]  I think, uh, might not necessarily line up perfectly in the Monday meetings. If we decide
[13:19.140 --> 13:23.720]  to put one out, I say whether I could do it or not. I think yes. Every time so far,
[13:23.820 --> 13:28.560]  give me your yes. There's like nine Gavin yeses and only two of them are yes.
[13:28.740 --> 13:33.920]  Yeah. Like I'll, I'll take the blame for what we have. I have no problem with that. I've laid out
[13:33.920 --> 13:37.860]  what I want to do and whether you guys want to or not, that's up to you. I have no problem with that.
[13:37.860 --> 13:44.940]  I am very, very, very mindful of not asking more of you because your obligations are larger
[13:44.940 --> 13:50.600]  than the rest of us combined outside of this podcast. Okay. Well, yeah, you're being very
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.860]  fair and nice. You're being very fair and nice because, because I'm a very, I'm a very fair.
[13:54.940 --> 14:02.920]  I'm the nice one. I'm a very fair, nice person. Yeah. Yeah. No, you want to dump the backlog.
[14:02.920 --> 14:08.920]  This one was absolutely wild. I don't want those videos. When we were, when we were talking about
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.920]  putting in a Thursday, let's play or whatever we, we would talk about a new slot. You were like,
[14:14.080 --> 14:17.280]  I don't want to start the new slot until we have the resources. We have more editors. And I just
[14:17.280 --> 14:21.780]  want to get, I just want to get a big backlog before we start putting stuff out. Two months
[14:21.780 --> 14:27.140]  later, delete the backlog. Sort the backlog. Well, the backlog is deceptive, Jeff. I don't think you
[14:27.140 --> 14:32.440]  were here for this. Oh, I probably wasn't. We have a deceptive backlog. Most of it, Andrew talked
[14:32.440 --> 14:38.000]  about is mostly GTA and Gears. And so I'm saying get rid of the stuff that isn't that let's start
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.720]  fresh. And then now we have, let's put out GTA and Gears. I think there's merit to what Eric's
[14:42.720 --> 14:48.340]  saying on a case by case basis. I don't want to flush an entire backlog, but I remember I've seen
[14:48.340 --> 14:53.180]  videos slip and stuff. And like, there's a Sea of Thieves video we recorded while we were still at
[14:53.180 --> 14:57.080]  Rooster Teeth, probably that has never made it out. And I went back and looked at my footage
[14:57.080 --> 15:01.620]  and my footage isn't great. And it's like, does that, do we need to put that Sea of Thieves video
[15:01.620 --> 15:06.060]  out? Or can we dump flush that and just record a new Sea of Thieves video, right? If there's a
[15:06.060 --> 15:11.800]  problem with Wreckfest, is Wreckfest so hard to recreate that we could just make a new Wreckfest
[15:11.800 --> 15:15.800]  video that doesn't have footage problems? You know what I mean? Like, I think we could take
[15:15.800 --> 15:19.800]  it in a, we could be very, I don't want to, I don't know how granular we want to get in this
[15:19.800 --> 15:26.100]  sausage talk, but we could go down the list and just make a decision video by video, carte blanching
[15:26.100 --> 15:31.100]  all of the GTA and all of the Gears, because I understand those are the vast majority of our back
[15:31.100 --> 15:35.980]  catalog. But I do feel like there's a lot of weird one-off videos that just maybe, maybe don't need
[15:35.980 --> 15:40.160]  to come out. I think if the, if the videos are just broken and jank beyond belief, like there's
[15:40.160 --> 15:44.840]  missing audio or missing video, then that makes sense. But I think we should look at them. I think
[15:44.840 --> 15:50.580]  what's important for me to clarify in this dumping of the backlog is just because we dump the backlog
[15:50.580 --> 15:55.240]  doesn't mean we're suddenly recent. I just want that communicated, not to us. And now I'm not
[15:55.240 --> 16:00.320]  talking, just as like from an audience perspective of if we dump what we're talking about, we're
[16:00.320 --> 16:06.140]  still releasing GTA videos that we recorded five months ago. Like that doesn't, that's not shifting.
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.420]  Correct. Totally. It's not like a sudden we're going to be timely on certain things. There's always
[16:10.420 --> 16:16.860]  going to be a delay. It is part of the size of our team and the editors we have at this, at least
[16:16.860 --> 16:23.960]  in this current reality of what we are, that will be a byproduct of making stuff. Yeah. And this is
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.380]  the video game stuff is also just a portion of what we're doing too. I don't want it to,
[16:27.380 --> 16:31.460]  I don't want the pendulum to swing so far in the video game side discussion that we don't pay
[16:31.460 --> 16:34.820]  attention to the supplementals and the podcast and the other stuff that we're doing too, because the
[16:34.820 --> 16:38.260]  video game stuff is just a portion of what we're doing. But it is, I think, the piece that we need
[16:38.260 --> 16:43.820]  to figure out the most because it is next to recording the podcast itself, the easiest thing
[16:43.820 --> 16:49.540]  for us all to record together from home. It also becomes of like releasing the backlog. We have a
[16:49.540 --> 16:54.840]  bunch of Gears of War videos and we have a bunch of GTA videos and the GTA videos, like we can
[16:54.840 --> 16:59.440]  release those. That's not really a problem. We've set a precedent on the Gears of War ones
[16:59.440 --> 17:04.020]  that they are at a certain tier. So then it becomes a question of like, even if we edited
[17:04.020 --> 17:11.120]  all of those, do we consecutively release 16 Gears videos? You understand what I mean? Like it causes
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.660]  there's a separate problem that needs to be solved in that scenario of what happens when one of
[17:15.660 --> 17:21.560]  these long form things ends up being tied to specific content here on our Patreon. Like what
[17:21.560 --> 17:27.360]  is the workaround to that? Do we remove it from that tier? Welcome to our new show, Years of
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.620]  Gears, where every week we release a new Gears of War video until we've played every Gears of War
[17:32.620 --> 17:37.900]  video. Like that's just another thing to think of as far as scheduling. So it's not even sometimes
[17:37.900 --> 17:44.360]  in the scenario in which we have it all put together and edited. It then becomes a thing of
[17:44.360 --> 17:51.540]  us having to be really thoughtful on what we label as what type of exclusivity. And then is there
[17:51.540 --> 17:57.520]  ever a scenario in which that exclusivity changes? My gut instinct to that is no, but at the same
[17:57.520 --> 18:03.680]  like we're 17 in, so it's like I could see people being, hey, I pay for extra medium. I don't
[18:03.680 --> 18:10.360]  necessarily want my video to be a Gears video every week. It wouldn't replace something that
[18:10.360 --> 18:14.580]  we already do for that tier, though. I think we were talking about having a slot that's just like
[18:14.580 --> 18:21.520]  a series slot. Yeah, we have, but we have released it in that context of this is the extra medium
[18:21.520 --> 18:27.000]  of that month. No, I think we keep it in the same tier, but it can be in a new slot. I think those
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.900]  slots are great for one-offs and also for us to test stuff with the Patreon members to see what
[18:32.900 --> 18:36.120]  sticks and what they like. And then if they latch on to something that we can peel it off
[18:36.120 --> 18:40.940]  into its own slot behind the behind the Patreon wall, whatever it's called,
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.720]  and do it that way, right? Like it could almost be like an incubator slot because I agree if I'm if
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.340]  I don't give a fuck about video games, I just like the podcast and I like drafts and I like
[18:51.340 --> 18:56.160]  rankings and I love blindsides and that kind of stuff in the watchalongs that I'm going to I might
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.520]  be a little miffed if all I get for the next six months is a Gears of War video in that slot,
[19:00.700 --> 19:05.780]  right? I don't want to do that for sure. Yeah, I think we should still look up Patreon supplementals
[19:05.780 --> 19:11.220]  as a continuing thing and any long-term series like if we do a weekly Gears until all those
[19:11.220 --> 19:15.880]  videos are out, that would be an additional. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I think that just go
[19:15.880 --> 19:19.920]  ahead. Go ahead. I was just going to say in the context in which we're describing that then
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.260]  becomes the thing of we need another editor for that. Yeah, and that's just something on our end
[19:23.260 --> 19:27.660]  that we need to be mindful of. Let's get one. I think the nice thing about it is is that we
[19:27.660 --> 19:32.360]  I was looking at the numbers. We do make a little bit of money off YouTube, but it's dog shit
[19:32.360 --> 19:38.420]  compared to everything else, right? Yeah. And so the idea that we would have to release any content
[19:38.420 --> 19:45.280]  in a way that makes sense for YouTube is out the window to me. So if we wanted to like like I'm
[19:45.280 --> 19:48.880]  just throwing this out there more for the audience too. We can be flexible with a lot of the stuff we
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.680]  do. If it's a series like Gears is a bad example because behind the paywall. But I wouldn't be
[19:54.680 --> 19:59.760]  opposed to releasing five videos in one week on YouTube and two the next week if that's the way
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.060]  it works out for us, if that's the way it makes the most sense for the content. You know, I don't want
[20:04.060 --> 20:09.300]  a monkey. I want people to know when they can come and expect content. But I also feel OK with with
[20:09.300 --> 20:14.500]  releasing stuff whenever the fuck we want to, if it makes sense for the content and not because
[20:14.500 --> 20:19.260]  we're not playing an algorithm game anymore. Sure. Totally. That's sort of the joy and like
[20:19.260 --> 20:24.400]  one of the things that is so amazing about us being supported on Patreon. And that is something
[20:24.400 --> 20:29.040]  that I bring up to remind myself because I keep forgetting that because we did it. I did it the
[20:29.040 --> 20:32.980]  other way for so long. You got to keep like I'll be looking at YouTube analytics and be like for
[20:32.980 --> 20:36.620]  like 20 minutes and be like, oh, wait, this doesn't really matter. Why do I give a fuck? This isn't.
[20:36.820 --> 20:40.500]  Yeah, this isn't where my audience is. This isn't where they're supporting us, you know, so
[20:40.500 --> 20:43.900]  just something to keep fucking. We've been doing it the other way for so long. It's just a good
[20:43.900 --> 20:47.400]  thing to remind yourself pretty constantly. I'm not worried about the analytics of it or whatever.
[20:47.540 --> 20:52.960]  It's just that I think when we start getting off track with upload dates and everything and it gets
[20:52.960 --> 20:58.240]  screwy, I think it messes with the audience's expectation of when they can come in and get the
[20:58.240 --> 21:03.780]  thing that they want on what day. And I think when I think when we start messing with people's
[21:03.780 --> 21:08.660]  schedules and everything, I think we're I think we're doing ourselves a disservice. I think that
[21:08.660 --> 21:12.100]  I think we're not doing I don't think we're doing the best for us. I think we're just going we have
[21:12.100 --> 21:15.600]  a bunch of videos. That's why I want to kill a bunch of the backlog. I don't want to mess with
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.760]  schedules either. I guess I wasn't saying like, when we talk about adding stuff, it's almost
[21:20.760 --> 21:27.180]  always additive. It's very rarely are we replacing. And so that's kind of why I wanted to do the
[21:27.180 --> 21:33.180]  weekly and I suggested we do the Monday GTA again. I think it's also I think people have an affection
[21:33.180 --> 21:37.860]  for that time slot from years ago, some of the some of the audience. So I think it kind of appeals
[21:37.860 --> 21:42.360]  to them, too. But it also adds a little bit of that structure. But I just I guess I was thinking
[21:42.360 --> 21:46.620]  if we wanted to dump, we had a tranche of like eight videos we were holding onto for no reason.
[21:46.720 --> 21:49.960]  If we wanted to dump them all at once, we could. I'm not saying we should. I'm not saying that's
[21:49.960 --> 21:54.500]  the best way to do it. But I'm saying I guess I care less about this stuff than I than I did
[21:54.500 --> 21:58.340]  previously. I'm more interested in just putting out in the way that makes the most sense for us
[21:58.340 --> 22:02.960]  and the audience and the content itself. I think there's all sorts of solutions to of even if it's
[22:02.960 --> 22:08.440]  like, hey, these videos only live on Patreon and it's called like an opening of the vault or
[22:08.440 --> 22:12.540]  something. Yeah, there's all sorts of ways we can handle it. I mean, we can dump in.
[22:12.860 --> 22:13.680]  Dregs Tuesday.
[22:14.500 --> 22:20.380]  Dregs Tuesday. I will say one thing that I've personally missed and it's just it's one of the
[22:20.380 --> 22:25.740]  things of like it's the windshield thing of building the car we used to do every month on
[22:25.740 --> 22:29.860]  our schedule. We would have an office day and that sometimes would be live action stuff.
[22:29.860 --> 22:34.220]  But a lot of the times it was remote and it would end up being like drafts and it would be
[22:34.220 --> 22:38.460]  a day every month where we recorded like four or five drafts in a day.
[22:38.580 --> 22:44.040]  And I really miss having that cadence of supplemental on the schedule. And I wanted
[22:44.040 --> 22:49.040]  to float by you guys because we have a Thursday let's play day where we record most of our stuff
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.600]  in that time frame. I'd love like a Friday, like draft day or just supplement like audio
[22:54.600 --> 22:58.600]  supplemental day to focus on the other stuff. I think that's a great idea. I'm right there
[22:58.600 --> 23:03.660]  with you, Andrew. I miss that as well. And there was like one of my favorite days ever recording
[23:03.660 --> 23:07.920]  was when we recorded. I don't remember what all three were, but we did the it was the day we did
[23:07.920 --> 23:12.060]  the mall draft and we just went back to back to back and every draft felt so different and had
[23:12.060 --> 23:16.000]  totally different energy. And it was just like it was it just felt like really accomplished
[23:16.400 --> 23:18.640]  knocking them all out in the same day. And I like doing that.
[23:18.880 --> 23:22.380]  I think that was a great format for recording. But we also need to be careful not to
[23:22.380 --> 23:27.280]  just shit stuff out in that slot if we can't if there's nothing planned. I feel like we
[23:27.280 --> 23:30.920]  can easily not do the recording. We don't have to quickly be like, oh, come up with something.
[23:31.320 --> 23:36.080]  I totally agree. But I feel like we're in a point right now with like drafts and stuff
[23:36.080 --> 23:39.980]  where we have like 60. Yeah. That we're like, yeah, that sounds great. We should do that.
[23:40.260 --> 23:43.580]  And then we just don't have that built in mechanism right now of actually doing it.
[23:43.660 --> 23:47.460]  Yeah. I mean, I'm sure that won't happen for a while. But if it's like Thursday evening,
[23:47.500 --> 23:52.120]  we're like, oh, what should we do tomorrow? I feel like if it's not forced, it's a lot better.
[23:52.400 --> 23:55.540]  Yeah, totally. And I think that's the idea of I mean, the flexibility,
[23:55.540 --> 23:59.260]  if we don't have anything to record, we don't need to record. We cancel it. But we also have
[23:59.640 --> 24:05.100]  the sheets document that Eric created and that I populated over the holiday. And it's like 28
[24:05.440 --> 24:09.540]  ideas in it now, too, that it's like if we're ever hurting for something to do,
[24:09.580 --> 24:12.660]  we could look at that. And there's a ton of stuff that we've identified that we
[24:13.260 --> 24:16.400]  really want to do at some point that we just haven't made it through yet.
[24:16.700 --> 24:20.900]  Yeah, I think that'd be great. I think we are at a point where we could have a new editor
[24:20.900 --> 24:26.000]  dedicated to a specific series that you could potentially just have a GTA editor.
[24:26.120 --> 24:30.800]  And whenever he's finished or she's finished, start downloading the next one. And they'll
[24:30.800 --> 24:33.280]  always just be one of those ready to go or maybe with gears or something.
[24:33.640 --> 24:35.580]  That's sort of what I have going right now.
[24:35.780 --> 24:36.980]  Do you have a new person?
[24:37.320 --> 24:42.280]  Not a new person. It's just they are rotational like they've got a lot of other stuff going on.
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.680]  So I like to be able to somebody we worked at with at Let's Play. I named Sean. They've done
[24:47.680 --> 24:52.520]  a majority of our GTA 5 stuff, just like coincidentally. And I recently reached out to
[24:52.520 --> 24:57.900]  them like late last week saying, hey, we have a bunch of these GTA videos. It'd be awesome if
[24:57.900 --> 25:02.220]  you could just like focus in on these for us and just hammer them out so we could start
[25:02.220 --> 25:05.360]  releasing them with some more regular cadence.
[25:05.580 --> 25:07.340]  That's something I don't think we've actually ever talked about
[25:07.340 --> 25:12.680]  within our own company is that you handle all of the post interaction.
[25:13.140 --> 25:13.200]  Yeah.
[25:13.600 --> 25:14.220]  And he does great.
[25:15.480 --> 25:16.240]  Thanks, Nick.
[25:16.260 --> 25:16.920]  No, it's for real.
[25:17.800 --> 25:20.060]  It's so efficient, so helpful and efficient.
[25:20.220 --> 25:23.780]  Yeah, Nick. Nick is absolutely right. You're very, very good at it.
[25:23.860 --> 25:28.540]  Like from from finding the people to like making the intro to getting them the footage
[25:28.540 --> 25:31.960]  and then delivering us the edited video. You just you just do it all.
[25:32.060 --> 25:34.700]  And here's the other thing. Making sure they get paid.
[25:34.880 --> 25:35.060]  Yeah.
[25:35.200 --> 25:36.800]  Seeing it through on the back end.
[25:37.040 --> 25:37.140]  Oh, yeah.
[25:37.180 --> 25:41.700]  Making sure that everything is done in like an administrative way.
[25:41.840 --> 25:46.500]  Andrew is taking care of all that stuff for like this video game post stuff. It's fantastic.
[25:46.500 --> 25:52.480]  And I don't know how you're so competent at that when you can barely start a game lobby.
[25:56.540 --> 25:59.440]  Oh, man.
[26:00.420 --> 26:02.820]  Or the status of your computer altogether.
[26:03.300 --> 26:03.840]  Yes.
[26:04.040 --> 26:07.040]  The fact that you do that with your pile of shit.
[26:07.860 --> 26:08.400]  Unbelievable.
[26:09.620 --> 26:15.320]  Well, we have a Q&A that, you know, part of our Patreon membership thing is that Falcons,
[26:15.320 --> 26:19.080]  I believe, can leave questions to be answered during sausage talks.
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.440]  I reset my computer at like five a.m. multiple times because I'm like,
[26:22.460 --> 26:25.920]  I need to be able to write these down and I don't need it to freeze.
[26:26.040 --> 26:31.100]  Like I need my runway for my Mac is like, if it's chunking, we're going to we need six hours.
[26:31.820 --> 26:33.180]  Is it squinkle chunking?
[26:33.540 --> 26:37.820]  It's oh, as soon as we're done this recording, I'm heading to see if I can get some.
[26:38.040 --> 26:40.360]  I just better go get some, too. I just remember it's on my schedule.
[26:40.380 --> 26:40.980]  She's a chunk.

[27:37.760 --> 27:40.440]  This is the new Star of the Seas.
[27:40.660 --> 27:42.640]  Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[27:43.300 --> 27:47.040]  I think a thing that we can afford now too is, and Nick needs this also,
[27:47.300 --> 27:51.620]  is new machines so we can keep up with what we need to do.
[27:51.740 --> 27:55.060]  Because that's not something we were able to do when we were a glass company.
[27:55.320 --> 27:58.500]  Like that was, you know, the budget and what we were doing or whatever,
[27:58.900 --> 28:00.380]  there was no hope for that.
[28:00.420 --> 28:05.140]  But we have a company where, and I don't know if people know how this stuff works or whatever,
[28:05.140 --> 28:09.980]  where it is, like, when you get this money, X amount needs to be spent.
[28:10.300 --> 28:13.220]  So that way, like, it's not taxed to hell and everything.
[28:13.360 --> 28:16.980]  Like that's the point of having a bank account with like this company.
[28:17.160 --> 28:21.760]  And so when we look at this stuff, we need to buy machines for you guys, especially you.
[28:21.980 --> 28:25.320]  But before we do that, we definitely need to see if Gavin can figure out
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.960]  your tech support needs, which I want to do desperately.
[28:30.400 --> 28:31.480]  Oh, it'll be so funny.
[28:31.480 --> 28:33.480]  Yeah, not at all.
[28:33.540 --> 28:37.380]  Like, I don't mean this in a disparaging way for where we were working previously.
[28:37.760 --> 28:41.860]  But when I was, I just sort of ended up as the head of Let's Play for that.
[28:42.540 --> 28:46.580]  And we had an issue where Eric and Nick were on last generation consoles.
[28:46.680 --> 28:47.260]  Yeah, we were.
[28:47.460 --> 28:49.920]  And it would cause some problems.
[28:50.020 --> 28:50.500]  Yeah, it did.
[28:50.580 --> 28:54.520]  And it was a thing of vocalizing of, hey, it'll be really nice to buy
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.160]  some current gen systems that cost like $300.
[28:58.160 --> 29:01.920]  And that not being a thing that was immediate, that they're like,
[29:01.980 --> 29:06.500]  we needed to build a justifiable case as to why we needed this.
[29:06.820 --> 29:11.840]  And it was just a thing of like, oh, oh, God, like this is a $600 purchase
[29:11.840 --> 29:13.360]  for the Let's Play channel.
[29:13.500 --> 29:19.500]  Almost all of the equipment I've had over the last six years, I've bought personally
[29:19.500 --> 29:22.800]  because I just couldn't deal with trying to get it purchased through the company.
[29:22.920 --> 29:23.400]  Oh my God, same.
[29:23.800 --> 29:26.600]  Yeah, especially if it's stuff I can find useful
[29:27.180 --> 29:28.340]  in my other line of work.
[29:28.440 --> 29:32.440]  I would just went ahead and just pay for stuff myself because going through all that shit.
[29:32.740 --> 29:36.640]  I also find it funny that Andrew is our person who handles all the posts.
[29:36.980 --> 29:40.580]  I like that he doesn't watch or proof anything, though.
[29:41.380 --> 29:43.680]  As soon as it's delivered, it's back on us.
[29:44.380 --> 29:46.640]  Because you hate listening to the stuff we're in, right?
[29:46.900 --> 29:47.460]  Or you're in.
[29:47.640 --> 29:49.600]  I just think I'm such a bad...
[29:49.600 --> 29:52.120]  Like I know sort of what I'm good at and what I'm bad at.
[29:52.420 --> 29:55.220]  I am so bad at determining if a thing is bad or good.
[29:55.820 --> 30:02.120]  And the way that like you have such a clear editor's vision of like how things should move.
[30:02.580 --> 30:07.040]  I don't know how to say this in any other way, but I am way too content with things being boring.
[30:07.200 --> 30:09.700]  Like my tolerance for boring is too high.
[30:09.920 --> 30:10.620]  I feel the same way.
[30:10.720 --> 30:13.060]  And I just don't have like...
[30:13.960 --> 30:14.280]  I'm with you.
[30:14.300 --> 30:16.700]  Like I'll watch it and I'll go like, oh, this is nice.
[30:16.780 --> 30:18.080]  Like this is, you know, we're just hanging out.
[30:18.120 --> 30:18.860]  It's kind of a vibe.
[30:18.940 --> 30:19.620]  It has a feel.
[30:19.860 --> 30:22.140]  And then you will, Gavin, be with like a scalpel.
[30:22.140 --> 30:25.060]  And then it'll, it'll be so much better.
[30:25.180 --> 30:29.160]  Whatever your version is after it's gone through those notes that I just go, I, I just get,
[30:29.520 --> 30:30.420]  I have no value here.
[30:30.520 --> 30:31.260]  I don't know how to do this.
[30:31.300 --> 30:36.260]  Andrew, you've totally, I've never been able to articulate how I feel when I get stuff back
[30:36.260 --> 30:38.960]  for notes where I watch it and I go, yes, I, yeah, it's fine.
[30:39.000 --> 30:39.540]  We're hanging out.
[30:39.640 --> 30:40.060]  We're doing this.
[30:40.200 --> 30:41.960]  Like I have, I have length to it.
[30:41.980 --> 30:42.660]  I don't give a shit.
[30:42.680 --> 30:48.740]  And then Gavin comes in and to say that he makes it 10 times better is an understatement probably
[30:48.740 --> 30:52.120]  because it is always better after a round of Gavin notes.
[30:52.120 --> 30:52.440]  Always.
[30:53.100 --> 30:56.040]  I try to keep it at no more than like two rounds though.
[30:56.200 --> 31:01.580]  Like very rarely am I watching the second or third version of anything, but I feel like editing,
[31:01.940 --> 31:04.980]  I could, you know, cause I've probably edited a thousand videos in my life.
[31:05.060 --> 31:08.760]  I feel like that's been the most helpful thing for me in terms of
[31:08.760 --> 31:11.000]  then turning around and creating the content,
[31:11.000 --> 31:12.840]  at least just having something in the back of my mind where I'm like,
[31:12.880 --> 31:15.080]  oh, that'll be fine because of this in the edit, blah, blah, blah.
[31:15.220 --> 31:18.200]  I feel like those moments are helpful when, when I'm actually recording.
[31:18.480 --> 31:18.760]  Totally.
[31:19.040 --> 31:19.800]  And it shows.
[31:20.040 --> 31:20.260]  Yeah.
[31:20.260 --> 31:24.640]  I think for me, when I'm making stuff, it's more of like, does this feel good in the moment?
[31:25.180 --> 31:28.740]  I'm sure we'll have enough to make something of it, but I'm, I don't have any,
[31:28.800 --> 31:31.840]  or I don't think I ever will. I think if I focus on editing the rest of my life,
[31:31.920 --> 31:36.940]  I would never have as clear of a vision as you do in terms of like,
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.360]  what is actually needed for this thing to be the best version of itself.
[31:41.440 --> 31:41.800]  Interesting.
[31:41.860 --> 31:43.180]  It's a very impressive skill that you have.
[31:43.200 --> 31:47.840]  I feel like most of my notes though are, hey, we're talking about this, cut to it.
[31:48.280 --> 31:52.420]  Or if I remember, if I remember from my own footage, sometimes I'm like,
[31:52.600 --> 31:55.180]  ah, you know, that bit where Eric fell off the roof,
[31:55.480 --> 31:59.960]  way funnier from this other person's angle than his own angle. Like a lot of the stuff
[31:59.960 --> 32:04.820]  in gameplay, it looks a lot funnier from another viewpoint than your own,
[32:05.200 --> 32:06.120]  especially if you get killed.
[32:06.440 --> 32:11.580]  I feel like as a rule, we try to give editor those notes in the content when it happens,
[32:11.620 --> 32:13.840]  like, oh, that looks so much better from my angle, cut to that, you know?
[32:13.920 --> 32:14.340]  Yeah, yeah.
[32:14.700 --> 32:16.560]  Like we try to help the editors out in that regard too.
[32:16.560 --> 32:20.840]  My favorite example of this is, you know, I was in a majority of the Let's Play stuff
[32:20.840 --> 32:25.260]  we did at Rooster Teeth. There was one video I wasn't where Jeff and Gavin did a bum bait.
[32:25.260 --> 32:29.020]  I was like, this is great. Like I get to just watch this as a fan of this content.
[32:29.140 --> 32:34.360]  This is, oh man, what a time. And so I watched it and I was like, that was great. No notes.
[32:34.780 --> 32:39.420]  And then Gavin came in and he had all these notes of like what should be trimmed and where.
[32:39.620 --> 32:43.420]  And then I watched his take of it and went, oh no, this is, yeah, this is great.
[32:43.420 --> 32:47.340]  Like this is so much better in a way that I would have even known,
[32:47.560 --> 32:50.580]  like I had no concept that there was better to be had.
[32:50.580 --> 32:54.280]  Yeah, I think that was, I remember that there was like a game that ended early because everyone
[32:54.280 --> 33:00.480]  dropped out that I just cut entirely. And then there was like a 15 second silent gap as we were
[33:00.480 --> 33:03.060]  waiting between games. And I was just like, we could just lose stuff like that because
[33:03.060 --> 33:06.000]  I feel like if people have these videos on in the background,
[33:06.580 --> 33:09.720]  sometimes they'll wonder if they just stopped playing and we could just cut those moments.
[33:09.780 --> 33:10.100]  Yes.
[33:10.100 --> 33:13.520]  I had something kind of like that happen at Rooster Teeth once when I was the creative
[33:14.300 --> 33:20.900]  director and I proofed a trailer for a show that was coming out. And I had like three notes,
[33:21.020 --> 33:25.600]  but otherwise I was like, yeah, it's pretty good. And then Jordan got ahold of it and the
[33:25.600 --> 33:29.920]  notes came back. It was like a novel of notes of why this was a bad trailer.
[33:30.780 --> 33:34.100]  And I thought, man, I really liked that trailer. And then I read all of his notes and I went like,
[33:34.140 --> 33:36.560]  I hate that fucking trailer. He's totally right.
[33:36.560 --> 33:43.360]  And you realize it's so stupid in that moment. Like, why did I not see all these 11 things that
[33:43.360 --> 33:48.620]  he saw? You know? It's all different perspectives, isn't it? Exactly. Exactly. I think that's why
[33:48.620 --> 33:53.860]  we work so well too, because we're, I think we're willing to give the notes if we need to or
[33:53.860 --> 33:58.940]  whatever, or know where we're strong and where we're not to like do that stuff. I could never
[33:58.940 --> 34:02.660]  hope to give the notes that Gavin gives. Cause I just go, I never even thought about that.
[34:02.680 --> 34:06.280]  Like Andrew's saying, like, I just don't, I'm not wired that way. Like that's just not where
[34:06.280 --> 34:11.080]  my brain is. And, uh, I don't know. It's pretty special to see, but then Gavin will come in and
[34:11.080 --> 34:14.900]  he's like, Hey, let's do this video where I just edited, like by yourself. You just went,
[34:14.960 --> 34:22.280]  I'm going to edit this 25 minute video of us playing GTA. And it's so cinematic. And it was
[34:22.280 --> 34:26.040]  like, this is an Xbox 360 game. And this looks like fucking crazy. It's like, it's gorgeous.
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.780]  And it's like, I never would have thought to make something that looks like this. I've never had
[34:31.780 --> 34:36.800]  a love for like the edit aspect. Like you make a movie, you make it three times. You're making
[34:36.800 --> 34:41.320]  it in pre, you're making it like in production. You're making it in post. I don't have the love
[34:41.320 --> 34:48.180]  for post. Gavin is so good at it. So, so, so good at it. It's great. Yeah. A few years ago,
[34:48.180 --> 34:53.220]  I learned how to use the rockstar editor, like key framing camera angles and just making like
[34:53.220 --> 34:58.680]  little cinematic things. And then I was never able to use it in content. I did actually record a
[34:58.680 --> 35:04.860]  game replays for Achievement Hunter, but I never got the go ahead to make it into a video that we
[35:04.860 --> 35:09.400]  all did. But now, now that's something I like about this format though, is that I can just
[35:09.400 --> 35:14.000]  make stuff and try it with you guys and see if it works. And everyone's kind of okay with that
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.400]  experimental style. Yes. A hundred percent. I think it is such a, I don't know what the word
[35:20.860 --> 35:26.340]  advantageous or just, it is a thing I appreciate so much about all of you that everyone has an
[35:26.340 --> 35:31.540]  absolute willingness to try whatever. Yes. And it doesn't necessarily mean it will work, but just
[35:31.540 --> 35:38.120]  like not having that hurdle of trying to just get the thing made, like we can make the thing and
[35:38.120 --> 35:43.480]  then learn if it's good after the fact and we can move on. Yeah. It is so nice. Because even if we
[35:43.480 --> 35:48.980]  burn an hour of all our time, it's, you know, five hours spent. But I feel like a lot of the time,
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.400]  even if it's not something we would put out or not something that works in this iteration,
[35:52.400 --> 35:56.240]  we can make something from it or build on it. And it just wasn't a waste of time.
[35:56.580 --> 36:01.180]  It is so nice. Like, God, let me tell you, man, it is... You talk about how nice that is.
[36:01.600 --> 36:08.620]  Given my previous role in the company, that was the thing that I probably had to learn to get the
[36:08.620 --> 36:14.420]  best at that I didn't enjoy doing at all, which you would assume that because I was a founder,
[36:14.660 --> 36:18.500]  that they would make everything I wanted to make. But that's not how that shit works at all.
[36:18.980 --> 36:22.920]  In some ways, I think that it works the opposite of that at some point.
[36:23.380 --> 36:29.520]  But you have to get really good at selling an idea to people. When you have an idea,
[36:29.600 --> 36:33.320]  I had to get really good at selling it to the Achievement Hunter guys and getting them on board
[36:33.320 --> 36:37.600]  and then selling it to whoever management was at the time and getting them on board to give us
[36:37.600 --> 36:41.720]  money. And you're having to do one sheets and you're having to do pitch docs and you're doing
[36:41.720 --> 36:47.500]  presentations. And I hated every second of it. But luckily, I got good enough at it that we were
[36:47.500 --> 36:52.440]  able to get most of our stuff made. But the idea that we don't have to do that now, that one sheet
[36:52.440 --> 36:59.260]  doesn't have to get generated for us to make something. That is so much of my behind-the-scenes
[36:59.260 --> 37:06.380]  rooster-teeth life that nobody, even most of y'all, maybe Eric some, never saw. It was just
[37:06.380 --> 37:11.020]  the fucking work I had to get in. I had to put into cajoling people to give us enough money to
[37:11.020 --> 37:15.640]  do something or to say yes or to even get the fucking cast to buy in because nobody wanted
[37:15.640 --> 37:21.180]  to do anything at some point, you know. It was like constant. I felt like a salesman 24 hours a
[37:21.180 --> 37:25.380]  day at Rooster Teeth. I think we talked about this before. Maybe it was like during a lunch or
[37:25.380 --> 37:31.360]  something. I had no idea that that's how you guys operated. Like, I never, you know, it's not like
[37:31.360 --> 37:34.720]  I was watching a ton of Achievement Hunter or anything. But I didn't know that people were like
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.520]  saying no to ideas. And this was, I don't know, like a year into us doing like Let's Play and
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.500]  stuff. And they're like, yeah, it was so hard to pitch this to this person or this person didn't
[37:44.500 --> 37:50.740]  want to do that. And it's like, what? The video games? People said no to the video games? And
[37:50.740 --> 37:55.640]  it's like, I just don't, I don't have that. I have games that I want to play. But when you guys go,
[37:55.840 --> 38:01.080]  let's play web phishing, it's not like I'm gonna go, no, I don't want to play web phishing. Like,
[38:01.300 --> 38:05.980]  what? Sometimes it was because of money and stuff, but a lot of times it wasn't. But like,
[38:06.140 --> 38:11.600]  Hardcore Monopoly was a show we did that everybody loved. We did it for two seasons.
[38:11.600 --> 38:15.060]  The company couldn't get enough of it. The audience couldn't get enough of it. It was a
[38:15.060 --> 38:22.080]  huge driver for first and all that stuff. But before that, I spent four fucking years pitching
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.840]  that show over and over and over again and getting told no. And then trying again in a couple months
[38:27.840 --> 38:33.940]  or, hey, we got a new tranche of money. Let's try again. Or, you know, our corporate goals have
[38:34.960 --> 38:38.540]  restructured. So maybe it fits in. It took me four years to get that made. And then you get
[38:38.540 --> 38:41.740]  made and they're like, cool, we want more of it. Hardcore everything. And you're like,
[38:41.780 --> 38:48.020]  God, you fucking assholes. I just love that. I don't have to live in that world.
[38:48.120 --> 38:53.040]  I mean, do you remember that? I think we did our first sausage talk. That was the thing I said
[38:53.040 --> 38:59.000]  about taking over Let's Play, of us being mindful or worrying about like, we're going to do this,
[38:59.040 --> 39:02.720]  and all they're going to ask for is this thing. And it's going to take focus away from the podcast.
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.060]  And like a note that I'm seeing from people online is like, yeah, I just really like the podcast.
[39:07.060 --> 39:10.360]  I wish they wouldn't talk so much about the Let's Plays or I wish, you know, it wasn't such a focus
[39:10.360 --> 39:16.960]  or whatever. And it's like, yeah, that's the thing I was afraid of. And we're more controlled for it
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.140]  and everything. And I don't know, it's just still something to be mindful of, I suppose.
[39:20.440 --> 39:25.340]  Yeah, totally agree. That's sort of where I think having that like Friday or whatever
[39:25.340 --> 39:30.140]  supplemental slot, just having something regular for that, I think it'd be nice because it's hard,
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.420]  you know, like we've had so much fun with video game stuff. But if you looked at the history of
[39:35.420 --> 39:41.820]  our show, it is incredibly new in the terms of like we went a long time without touching anything
[39:41.820 --> 39:46.040]  video game related. And it's been such a fun thing to explore. And obviously, there's that history
[39:46.040 --> 39:51.920]  with Achievement Hunter. But I just it's it's wanting to like be mindful of we really started
[39:51.920 --> 39:57.400]  being audio centric. And let's not forget to develop that. Yeah, I think our main podcast
[39:57.400 --> 40:03.300]  is the main focus and always will be. And even though we play video games for work,
[40:03.300 --> 40:07.600]  we kind of always did that. Like Andrew and I used to play all the time outside of work before
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.920]  we were recording them. So it's not like we're like using up resources that we would be putting
[40:12.920 --> 40:18.900]  into the podcast. But I do think we can be better about not going over moments from Let's Plays we
[40:18.900 --> 40:23.980]  just filmed in the middle of a regulation. It's just so much of what we do is enthusiasm based.
[40:24.140 --> 40:29.140]  But I think I think it's good to keep it in check. And, you know, I'll be honest, I love doing the
[40:29.140 --> 40:34.040]  video game stuff. And it's reignited my love of video games. And I I'd be scared to see how many
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.340]  hours of Call of Duty Black Ops six I have right now going for these dark matter skins. I just hit
[40:39.340 --> 40:44.380]  my fifth prestige. Wow. Hey, I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting I'm getting there. But I've
[40:44.380 --> 40:49.000]  never had as much fun playing a video game with you guys as I have doing a draft with you guys.
[40:49.000 --> 40:53.780]  So just so the audience knows like I love the video game stuff. It's like low hanging fruit.
[40:53.780 --> 40:59.500]  It's easy to do. It's great. But when we're cranking and arguing about hot dog and ice cream
[40:59.500 --> 41:06.360]  pairings, that to me is like Shangri-La. That's my Garden of Eden, personally. It's a lot funnier
[41:06.360 --> 41:14.040]  to see dogs and cream draft on the calendar, too. Yeah, it is. I said like, you know, that's pure
[41:14.040 --> 41:19.100]  creative expression. And I it doesn't get any better than that, I think, personally. And we
[41:19.100 --> 41:24.320]  say that Andrew obviously handling all of the video game post, but pretty much it's just Nick
[41:24.320 --> 41:29.400]  doing the audio post. Oh, yeah. You just take care of it. It's it's pretty simple. The upside to that
[41:29.400 --> 41:33.100]  is I don't have to worry about the post on the other side of stuff. The only thing I'm really
[41:33.100 --> 41:39.000]  doing is just helping gathering. We use a backup system that's that's an add on to Discord. It's
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.680]  called Craig, and he automatically records. It's not the best quality, but it's still better quality
[41:43.680 --> 41:50.680]  than, say, not having audio at all. So so after a recording is over, I'll go back and pull those
[41:50.680 --> 41:55.260]  and add them to the folder where we've uploaded everything. And that's that's kind of like the
[41:55.260 --> 41:59.980]  extent of where I touch all the any and all of the gaming stuff. But all the audio stuff is just
[41:59.980 --> 42:03.460]  simple because it's the podcast and it's the drafts and it's all the other things. And it's,
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.940]  you know, weekly. So it's easy to track in that sense. And I still have the Craig backups if I
[42:07.940 --> 42:14.020]  need them. We rarely need to use them, but they're there just in case. And it's, you know, there are
[42:14.020 --> 42:19.020]  weeks where it's obviously busier than others. You know, someone's out of town. We have a holiday or
[42:19.020 --> 42:22.960]  something coming up or whatever. And we've recorded multiple like back to back. Suddenly it becomes
[42:22.960 --> 42:26.780]  like, oh, where the hell is this thing? But it's been really simple and easy to keep track of
[42:26.780 --> 42:33.200]  everything now that I don't edit a hundred podcasts. Yeah, but I was going to say, like, I run two
[42:33.200 --> 42:39.520]  companies with you and you are the busiest, I think, in both. Like you're just constantly
[42:39.980 --> 42:44.020]  on something, doing something onto the next edit. Here's more stuff. Here's another proof. Hey,
[42:44.040 --> 42:50.080]  can we get this up on this day? Like, I think you're, and you have a very young kid and you
[42:50.080 --> 42:57.360]  are, you are insanely busy. You're insanely busy. It's crazy. Well, it's funny because it's like the,
[42:57.360 --> 43:01.700]  the balance of the back and forth is like, I don't want either company to feel like they're not being
[43:02.040 --> 43:06.320]  prioritized. So I prioritize both like certain days of the week, like focusing on an edit. And
[43:06.320 --> 43:10.420]  if we have a recording or something come up, I can push that edit back. And it's just kind of finding
[43:10.420 --> 43:17.600]  that balance. And obviously the young kiddo is also a bit of a, like last week, Eric was like,
[43:18.080 --> 43:21.780]  we were going to record something at a set time. We're like, we're all ready. Let's do this. And I
[43:21.780 --> 43:26.140]  was like, nah, I dropped off my kid. I had to go to the, I had to, I had to go to the car shop.
[43:26.920 --> 43:31.100]  Oh, the kid has a doctor's appointment. Oh, the kid has another doctor's appointment. You know,
[43:31.100 --> 43:35.500]  so it's like finding that balance. And Jeff probably knows better than most.
[43:36.500 --> 43:39.680]  It's been funny jokes on our end though. We've all appreciated it.
[43:39.840 --> 43:42.760]  Yeah. In the moment, they're not as funny to me, but afterwards I love them.
[43:48.240 --> 43:51.760]  Are you, now do you, but do you feel good about that, Nick? Like, do you feel like you're in a
[43:51.760 --> 43:55.280]  good place? Is there anything we could do to lessen the load, to make your life easier?
[43:55.700 --> 43:59.500]  Because I think it's good. It's a good time for a check-in because you are balancing these two
[43:59.500 --> 44:04.100]  companies. And like, for instance, if you need us to, Gavin and I will go over there tonight and
[44:04.100 --> 44:07.580]  burn a hundred percent, eat to the ground. We're happy to do that.
[44:07.860 --> 44:13.320]  Why did we show you the office? Uh, no, I think I, I'm in a pretty good spot. I think the only
[44:13.320 --> 44:17.940]  times where we could potentially run into things and, but we know ahead of time, usually it's just
[44:17.940 --> 44:23.360]  when we have a supplemental, that is one of the audio ones. In addition to like, say a busy
[44:23.780 --> 44:28.780]  recording week for us or a busy recording week for a hundred percent eat. So it's probably just up to
[44:28.780 --> 44:32.900]  me to be like, Hey, do you mind if we reach out to someone else? And we have actually had
[44:32.900 --> 44:37.360]  a couple of folks that we reached out to, to help us with a couple edits. Dennis, who actually
[44:37.360 --> 44:44.480]  edited face in several instances, probably in between when I was unavailable and when Kelly
[44:44.480 --> 44:48.460]  was unavailable to edit the original run of the show. And he would step in and do that. So he's
[44:48.460 --> 44:52.080]  been able to help us with a few things. He actually put together all the advent calendar stuff since
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.240]  that had a video component as well. So he's been very helpful. It is weird, actually, that you
[44:56.240 --> 45:01.140]  mentioned that because I was listening to an audio. I think it was an actual regulation episode.
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.380]  It was. And I was like, someone else edited this, didn't they? I could just, I could just tell
[45:06.380 --> 45:10.020]  from listening. It was snappier. It was a little bit snappy. There was less pauses.
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.880]  Did you like it better? Do we like Dennis better than Nick? Hey, Nick, plug your ears for a second.
[45:15.000 --> 45:22.700]  Okay. Hold on. I feel like, I feel like Nick edits us the best. I do too. He is us. He's us.
[45:27.340 --> 45:33.140]  Thank you. I feel like we kind of like have discussed kind of scheduling stuff. Is there
[45:33.140 --> 45:37.540]  anything related to like the schedule that we want to touch on that we haven't? Uh, well,
[45:37.580 --> 45:42.060]  there's going to be a period at some point where I think we talk about new ideas and some of the
[45:42.060 --> 45:46.060]  new ideas are going to, would be related to altering the schedule. So I don't know if that's
[45:46.060 --> 45:51.400]  a natural segue or we want to just hold off on that. I'd love to hear about new ideas. Why don't we
[45:51.400 --> 45:55.240]  real quick just run through merch? And I don't think it needs to be a long conversation, but
[45:55.240 --> 45:59.940]  just kind of catch people up to where we are because merch is the thing that Face did very
[45:59.940 --> 46:05.280]  well. And that regulation has, it has in its infancy right now. And we're definitely like
[46:05.700 --> 46:09.420]  merch is one of the reasons I feel like I'm not jogging yet, but we're getting close.
[46:09.820 --> 46:16.340]  You know, we did the big run. What, what we did in 2024 was we created the structure. We found a
[46:16.340 --> 46:20.420]  partner that looked good, that we, that we wanted to give a shot to, that we thought maybe we could
[46:20.420 --> 46:23.980]  trust that worked with some people that used to work at Rooster Teeth that we had a lot of respect
[46:23.980 --> 46:31.020]  for. And we did a essentially two tests through that company to make sure that the website works,
[46:31.100 --> 46:36.560]  the company is able to handle the volume. As a matter of fact, that company did a fucking no
[46:36.560 --> 46:42.120]  shade to our previous fulfillment house at Rooster Teeth, but the new company handled those Gerplers
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.260]  better than any Gerpler drop we've ever had. Incredible. At Rooster Teeth. I agree. They were
[46:47.260 --> 46:52.820]  so quick and efficient and on it. And their response to us was, that was great. We want more,
[46:52.820 --> 46:59.900]  which I fucking love to hear. Right. And so I think we all feel now in 2025, really good about
[46:59.900 --> 47:04.340]  the partnership we have with our fulfillment company and the pipeline that we have developed.
[47:04.540 --> 47:10.900]  And now we want to turn the nozzle on the hose a little bit more. Obviously, we have more Gerplers
[47:10.900 --> 47:17.060]  coming in February and Koozlers as well. We've talked about that, but we also have some t-shirt
[47:17.060 --> 47:21.940]  related merchandise coming up in the few months we've been, we were in the lab. I don't, have we
[47:21.940 --> 47:27.560]  talked about this on episode? Not really. It's something that we kind of like poked around,
[47:27.680 --> 47:30.180]  but I don't think we like talked about it, talked about it because we didn't know if it could be
[47:30.180 --> 47:36.020]  like made. Yeah, but it can be made. So we should probably talk about it on the main podcast then,
[47:36.300 --> 47:41.800]  but we're, we have an innovative t-shirt idea that we're going to launch hopefully in the next few
[47:41.800 --> 47:47.040]  months. And that I think is going to revolutionize casual dress. You're going to be able to get a lot
[47:47.040 --> 47:51.580]  more mileage out of your clothing than you used to. And we're pretty excited about that.
[47:51.940 --> 47:58.660]  That's kind of where we are is now that we feel really good and we feel like we have a solid
[47:58.660 --> 48:05.000]  foundation, we want to start making more merch and doing it more in the way that we did with
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.160]  F*** Face, which is where the, you know, the merch is very often a piece of the bit or a part of the
[48:10.160 --> 48:14.420]  bit or the reason for the bit or the by-product of the bit, but it's somehow of the content.
[48:14.520 --> 48:19.740]  It's not just a logo slap. And that was a scary thing for us because we didn't know that we'd
[48:19.740 --> 48:24.500]  be able to get that kind of service again outside of RT. That's a tremendous boutique service we
[48:24.500 --> 48:29.060]  received in the company. I think a thing that, like we released the Gerplers and there were 4,000
[48:29.060 --> 48:32.460]  and it sold out so fast and everything and people like, why don't you just do more? And it's like,
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.740]  we've never done anything like this as just five guys. We didn't, like, we don't know what we're
[48:37.740 --> 48:42.680]  doing. We don't know if this is going, we could have gotten 4,000 and the whole thing could have
[48:42.680 --> 48:48.700]  tanked and we couldn't have, and we could have sold none because of a issue with Shopify. Like
[48:48.700 --> 48:52.360]  there could have been so many things that went wrong. We had to, we had to test in like a bunch
[48:52.360 --> 48:56.520]  of different ways. That's why we put the shirt out. Like we're baby stepping into this thing,
[48:56.580 --> 49:01.320]  not because it's, I think with like content, we can be a little bit more experimental. I don't
[49:01.320 --> 49:07.660]  want to be experimental with your money. This is why we don't do pre-orders. It's why we do merch
[49:07.660 --> 49:11.760]  like the way that we're doing it. We're slow rolling it. We're figuring it out now is because
[49:11.760 --> 49:17.320]  when you, when it's your money parting from you, I don't want that to be an issue. I want you to
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.820]  be thrilled with the thing that you got and the thing that you bought and there were no problems
[49:21.820 --> 49:26.340]  and it was super smooth. That's what I'm hoping for every time we're putting stuff out. And now I
[49:26.340 --> 49:31.340]  feel really confident working with this company and what we're doing. And I am so excited for
[49:31.340 --> 49:35.940]  like mid-February with these new Gerplers. Can you imagine, like my nightmare, we always talked
[49:35.940 --> 49:39.980]  about like, you know, with the ordering and stuff and how many to order, but my real nightmare was
[49:39.980 --> 49:45.460]  what if we sell 4,000 Gerplers in 10 minutes and the company can't ship them because they're
[49:46.260 --> 49:51.120]  overloaded and it breaks their system and they're having to hire seasonal help to come in. And now
[49:51.120 --> 49:55.660]  instead of having 4,000 people disappointed because they didn't get a Gerpler, we have 4,000
[49:55.660 --> 49:59.840]  people disappointed because they paid money for a Gerpler that they didn't get, which is way worse
[49:59.840 --> 50:04.760]  to me, you know? Yep. So, you know, appreciate everyone being patient with us. I feel like,
[50:04.840 --> 50:07.940]  especially for this drop or whatever, there were people that were disappointed they didn't get it.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.780]  And I totally understand. I, you know, I want the things that I want when I want them as well,
[50:11.780 --> 50:16.060]  but I really appreciate people being patient and understanding that we are just five guys
[50:16.060 --> 50:20.300]  trying a new thing with a company that is a new company that we hadn't worked with before ever.
[50:20.780 --> 50:25.140]  Like we worked with Natalie and we worked with Tony and well, I don't know any of these other
[50:25.140 --> 50:29.780]  people and it was really positive. It was a super positive thing that went really well. And I think
[50:29.780 --> 50:34.280]  now we're really excited to like ramp up. I think this year is going to be the year of like really
[50:34.280 --> 50:39.040]  cool merch for us. Yeah, I think so too. But that's merch in a nutshell. I feel like we've
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.300]  talked ad nauseum about it in previous Sausage Talks, but we're in a really good place.
[50:43.740 --> 50:47.860]  We build a good foundation and we're excited to start taking more swings.
[50:48.320 --> 50:51.980]  We'll announce the Gerplers soon in like an actual episode also, but it'll be mid-February,
[50:52.080 --> 50:56.200]  so don't don't worry about it. In addition, I think with, you know, moving forward and looking
[50:56.200 --> 51:00.880]  forward for new stuff, I think we're also very open to the idea of looking at the back catalog
[51:00.880 --> 51:05.120]  for merch that people really identified with or like that they weren't able to get more of. Like,
[51:05.120 --> 51:11.660]  we could sell more scrumping signs or protected by falcon signs if that was a thing that people
[51:11.660 --> 51:15.500]  wanted, you know, like that because that stuff is in the vault doesn't mean the vault stays shut
[51:15.500 --> 51:18.960]  or has to stay shut. Important to note that we have the rights to all those things and we can
[51:18.960 --> 51:23.660]  make them as we see fit. We can look in both directions. Yeah, we talked about it the other
[51:23.660 --> 51:27.960]  day. It was the slop o'clock clocks or whatever, and we just went that thing was so good and it
[51:27.960 --> 51:31.680]  didn't sell. That's the thing I'm worried about. It was just us being bummed to death about that
[51:31.680 --> 51:35.100]  slop o'clock. God, I love it too, because we all talked about how we have it hanging in our
[51:35.100 --> 51:39.520]  houses. It's like I'm looking at it right now. Me too. It's right behind me. It's great. I love
[51:39.520 --> 51:45.140]  that thing. It's great. Fantastic. Why are there ridges on Reese's peanut butter cups? Probably
[51:45.140 --> 51:50.120]  so they never slip from her hands. Can you imagine? I'd lose it. Luckily, Reese's thought
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.300]  about that. Wonder what else they think about? Probably chocolate and peanut butter.

[52:26.780 --> 52:30.740]  Okay, Andrew, do you have some Falcon questions or is there anything else you guys want to get at?
[52:30.740 --> 52:35.020]  I sure do. Yeah. Is there anything else we want to touch on before I feel like we wrap on
[52:35.020 --> 52:39.300]  questions? I think we go to questions and we kind of just see where it goes, because I have a feeling
[52:39.300 --> 52:41.740]  there's going to be more that we're going to want to talk about. And this is really going to spark
[52:41.740 --> 52:46.120]  us in a direction. I do. I do think we don't do it now. We can do it after questions. But I do
[52:46.120 --> 52:50.640]  think, Eric, we should pitch Wheel of Decades at some point in this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, guys,
[52:50.660 --> 52:54.980]  stay tuned through questions because at the end of questions, we're pitching Wheel of Decades.
[52:56.060 --> 52:59.640]  And are we Nostradamus? I am so excited to learn what both those are.
[52:59.640 --> 53:04.260]  I pulled some questions. We honestly, we should make time to do a sausage talk that are just
[53:04.260 --> 53:09.100]  questions. We have so many of them that are good. These are just some that I pulled. If your
[53:09.100 --> 53:14.080]  question is not asked here, don't worry. I like I have it saved. It's just these are ones that I
[53:14.080 --> 53:18.940]  pulled for this specific recording. First one comes from Mr. Fedora Mustache. Would the guys
[53:18.940 --> 53:24.700]  ever retry old content slash bets slash alphabet 100 percent chocolate is successful beanhole
[53:25.200 --> 53:30.340]  bobbing for Bovril? I was curious if you guys had any bets that you felt like didn't deliver in the
[53:30.340 --> 53:33.880]  past or that you'd have any interest in revisiting. I thought that was an interesting question.
[53:33.980 --> 53:38.880]  Nothing came to mind for me personally. I want Eric to drink the Bovril. Can we talk? Did we
[53:38.880 --> 53:42.540]  talk about that in Mexico? And you're like, oh, have you ever had that? Like, no. And you're
[53:42.540 --> 53:47.340]  like, you should try it. No. I'd like to see. Nick wants it. Nick wants to try it. That's the thing.
[53:47.380 --> 53:52.760]  Nick wants it. OK, that's what we should do. Me and Nick will try it together. Oh, that's a great
[53:52.760 --> 53:58.480]  idea. Yeah. It used to be that the food stuff was typically done by Jeff, Andrew and myself. Yes.
[53:58.640 --> 54:03.040]  Before you two other guys became a bigger part. And maybe, yeah, maybe there's like a little
[54:03.040 --> 54:09.240]  backlog gauntlet of disgusting food that you should go through. I will say as a person who's had
[54:09.240 --> 54:15.460]  Bovril two ways, stateside and overseas, the best way to to experience Bovril for the first time
[54:15.460 --> 54:20.620]  would probably be in England itself. Maybe maybe we should make a trip over to England just for
[54:20.620 --> 54:28.800]  you guys to drink Bovril. Watch some footy. Yeah, we could do that, too. Oh, OK. You just increased the price of this bit.
[54:29.260 --> 54:32.820]  Yeah, no kidding. I thought it was going to be one dollar and it's way more than one dollar now.
[54:32.980 --> 54:40.060]  One thousand one. I think the stuff that we need to pay off is the face off stuff. Yes. I think
[54:40.060 --> 54:43.540]  I think we need to do we'll figure it out. We don't have to get into it here or whatever.
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.660]  We need to do the deputy Indiana thing. We have to figure out billboard is a pretty loose term,
[54:48.660 --> 54:53.620]  I think, at this point because we don't have the buying power of Warner Brothers. But I think Nick
[54:53.620 --> 54:57.280]  needs to wear these boots and we'll figure that out at a later date. And we have to physically
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.820]  visit deputy Indiana and at least put a stick with a sign on it in the ground or something.
[55:02.100 --> 55:07.580]  Do you think there's a guy in Indiana or deputy Indiana called Bill and it could just be Bill's
[55:07.580 --> 55:14.300]  board and he just holds it sometimes? He holds it sometimes. This is Bill's board that he occasionally
[55:14.300 --> 55:19.980]  holds. You know what? I had the exact same thought. I completely agree with you, Gavin.
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.560]  How many? What was the population? It's less than 10,000. It was like 800. Yeah. Very,
[55:25.680 --> 55:30.160]  very, very, very, very low. There's got to be a bill at 800 people. There's got to be a bill.
[55:30.480 --> 55:35.160]  One in 800 name. In Indiana? Yeah. Yeah. I guarantee you it's probably 10 bills.
[55:35.600 --> 55:40.000]  Well, it does say deputy Indiana population 19. Whoa. I thought it was like 800 when we looked
[55:40.000 --> 55:47.760]  at it last time. Maybe they had a bad one of COVID or something. The census in 2010 was 86.
[55:48.440 --> 55:55.420]  In 2022, population of 19. That might be a stretch for a bill. It's possible though.
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.580]  It might be. Maybe we'll just stick it on Bill's grave. Oh my god.
[56:01.380 --> 56:07.360]  I thought we got past the grave thing with you. He's dead. He doesn't care. He's in heaven.
[56:07.360 --> 56:14.120]  Or hell. Yeah. To be determined. If he's in hell, fuck him. Next question comes from Josh Thomas.
[56:14.680 --> 56:19.080]  What have been some of the crew's favorite moments since the rebrand? Any like specific
[56:19.080 --> 56:23.980]  thing jump out to you guys is like, man, this is great. I think the streams for me have been
[56:23.980 --> 56:29.640]  something where it's like doing a make way thing and then it being 505 or being yelled at for an
[56:29.640 --> 56:38.560]  hour in Pico Park. There was one bit in Pico Park where I was just, I was behind Eric and he had to
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.600]  jump over a thing and I just kept ramming into the back of him and he just goes, give me space,
[56:43.900 --> 56:48.960]  give me space, give me space, dipshit. And then I give him space, I back off and he runs straight
[56:48.960 --> 56:59.260]  into the enemy. No, I don't remember that. I really enjoyed sloppy Joe's bingo, sloppy bingo
[56:59.260 --> 57:04.600]  on Halloween. Oh, that was so much fun. That was a great one. Yeah. Also the night we watched Eric's
[57:04.600 --> 57:10.020]  wrestling show together with the audience. That was so great. I appreciated that so much. That
[57:10.020 --> 57:15.240]  meant so much to me. Thank you very much. That really was great. We had a blast doing it. I think
[57:15.240 --> 57:21.340]  it's not even like a moment that sticks out to me. It's the regular schedule that we have that I look
[57:21.340 --> 57:27.000]  forward to. Like before we recorded this today, I was sitting in the discord for half an hour
[57:27.000 --> 57:32.720]  just going like, I'll see if anyone's early. Like, I just, I love, I love just being able to
[57:32.720 --> 57:38.480]  make the time to do this stuff where we didn't have the time for it previously. Now it's like
[57:38.480 --> 57:42.820]  a lot of gameplays, a lot of other stuff. And it's just, it's fun. It's like a lot of fun to do.
[57:42.940 --> 57:47.460]  And I love doing it. I never don't look forward to getting together to do this stuff. Yeah,
[57:47.480 --> 57:53.580]  that's such a great call. I had a very similar experience where I guess last week I was super
[57:53.580 --> 57:58.180]  sick and I was going to miss our Monday sync, but I was awake. I was like, I'll just, I can't talk,
[57:58.240 --> 58:02.680]  but I'll just listen so I can keep in the loop on like what this week looks like. And that was
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.920]  the highlight of my week that week. And as I spent the rest of the week going like just having that
[58:07.920 --> 58:13.520]  like 30 minutes to hang out with you guys, it was just so much fun. How lucky I am that I get to
[58:13.520 --> 58:18.060]  have that be part of my work that like the highlight of my week to that point from just like
[58:18.060 --> 58:23.580]  happiness and like entertainment was a Monday sync meeting. That's crazy. That's an incredibly
[58:23.580 --> 58:28.920]  privileged position to be in that I'm incredibly thankful for. I feel the same way. I really like
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.780]  cherish all the time that we get to just chat and record and do work. And even in the time in
[58:33.780 --> 58:38.560]  between, I'm really excited to make stuff and then just show it to you guys. Like we did with
[58:38.560 --> 58:44.920]  the GTA highlights. And I went and made that little GERPLER promo. I was just so excited to show you
[58:44.920 --> 58:50.720]  after I was done making it. Oh, it's so cool. I think the moment I realize when we've gone and
[58:50.720 --> 58:54.280]  this is a poor example, but it's the only one that's in my head at the moment because I just
[58:54.280 --> 58:59.520]  saw it again. But realizing when we've gone from like Falcon to Falcon, where you just like you're
[58:59.520 --> 59:04.500]  in a moment and something is interesting or like a hot dog is a great example. A hot dog was a
[59:04.500 --> 59:09.260]  throwaway question. It wasn't actually it wasn't a question. A hot dog was my answer to a question
[59:09.260 --> 59:14.540]  I was asking you guys. And you go from like to realize when you've gone from like that moment
[59:14.540 --> 59:18.580]  where it's just like the dumbest little thing or you're like, is that a fucking Falcon that just
[59:18.580 --> 59:24.400]  walked by the pool? And then the next thing you know, you're sold out of merch, you know, or
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.840]  there's a hot dog count on the website and everybody's, you know, Reddit's awash with people
[59:28.840 --> 59:32.840]  tracking their hot dogs. And you're like, man, it's so weird when you have that. There's like a
[59:32.840 --> 59:36.500]  moment when you realize, oh, that little thing became this big thing because you've been along
[59:36.500 --> 59:40.720]  for the ride the whole time. So it feels quite natural to you. But when you at some point, you
[59:40.720 --> 59:44.920]  naturally take a step back and then you see it for like, how did that dumb thing turn into this
[59:44.920 --> 59:49.880]  big thing? That's a really cool feeling. And I felt that a lot this year. It's weird to see like quite
[59:49.880 --> 59:56.460]  a heated or quite a serious discussion over such a dumb thing sometimes as well. Like, what counts
[59:56.460 --> 01:00:02.640]  as a hot dog? Yeah, I love it so much. And I get it in person a lot. That's a question people like
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:10.080]  to ask me when they run into me. And I gotta be like, well, there's a spirit to it. We were talking
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:16.360]  the other day about how exciting it is to run into regulation listeners in real life. It's that so
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.480]  many of them are right up to date on the podcast. They'll talk to you about something that came out
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.180]  yesterday. And because it's still fresh in my mind, I'm like, yeah, can you believe it? Like,
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:31.380]  what a bunch of bullshit. It is awesome because you feel like you have something like you can
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:35.680]  talk about now, right? Like, it's really cool. It really is cool when somebody comes up to me and
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.060]  says, oh, Jeff, it's so nice to see you. I loved Red vs. Blue, and I watched it every day in
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.580]  middle school. You meant a lot to me. And you go, thanks, man. I really appreciate that. And then
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.480]  you move on with your day. But then somebody comes up to you and goes, I really like what
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:54.300]  you did yesterday. You're like, fucking awesome. Yeah, it's great. Next question is from Paul
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:03.000]  Davenport. Any update on the Eric and or Nick plays Halo 2? Yasso, hasso, nasso, lasso. That's
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.320]  the thing we talked about that I'm very excited as a possibility. It doesn't even have to be Halo
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.220]  2. Just Eric's first experiences with some of these games being in a lasso format, I think
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:18.940]  it's so funny. Don't make it Halo 2. That's cruel. It couldn't be Halo 2 because it's two player. Is
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.720]  it? It's a two player, but it's also the hardest, most unforgiving. Yeah, I think that's mine and
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:31.340]  Nick's series. Yeah, yeah, that that could finally be Gavin and Nick's show. I'd watch it. I hope we
[01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:37.340]  still get along at the end. It's hell. What's a lasso that we do then? I don't know anything about
[01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:42.520]  this. Reach was a good lasso, right? Three to reach? Reach works. Three would be doable, probably.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.460]  Three and reach are great. There's also like the endurance based stuff in ODST that we could do,
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:51.700]  like we could try and get that two hour achievement. Remember that one? Oh yeah. The
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:58.040]  Fidmaster. Fidmaster challenge. There's a few of those, right? Yes. Next question comes from
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.840]  Christopher Shanks. Have you guys thought of doing a cassette release of an episode since
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:09.400]  you've done the vinyl cassettes? More popping up now in like a weird way. Also, I don't know a
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.620]  lot about cassettes, but theoretically, couldn't we make that ourselves as opposed to pressing a
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:19.400]  vinyl? Record a cassette in real time, one at a time. That's what I'm saying. Like, couldn't we
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:24.760]  theoretically do that? Like there's no we can't press a vinyl, but we could technically make a
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:31.200]  shitty cassette. Yeah, we could. It would take like nine years to make 10,000 of them probably.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  Who's we? Who is we? Oh yeah, who is we? Well, Nick's the audio guy.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:42.680]  Uh, I mean, I feel like we'd be doing it just to do it, right? Dude, yeah, I do not feel
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:49.060]  a pull to do cassette anything. And then also in terms of like what merch capabilities I guess we
[01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:54.100]  have and what we could do. I just, I don't know. I don't know. Are cassettes going to bang? I don't
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:02.760]  really... we'd have to be like so limited. Andrew and Nick, I did pitch Gavin and Eric on an idea
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.640]  for a vinyl over the weekend that I don't think they're on board for, but maybe you guys are
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.440]  excited about it? No, absolutely not on board for. No, absolutely not. We were talking about what
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.140]  different things to do with the wheel. One of the funny ideas we came up with is a pocket wheel of
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:17.460]  decisions. You spin it and then it like whatever it lands on, it's like, it's kind of like the
[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.080]  magic eight ball, but you just carry it around your pocket. And whenever you want to make a
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.400]  decision, you spin the wheel and then it tells you like half a car or no, or do it tomorrow.
[01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.960]  But what if we recorded a... similarly, what if people wanted to glean insights from the wheel?
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:40.780]  What if we created a vinyl that was the wheel and then every song on the vinyl is like an eight
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:49.840]  second song, eight second track, and it's just 55 minutes of going, yes, 11, do it Wednesday.
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.000]  And then you just, wherever you turn the record on, wherever you drop the wheel and whatever you
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:02.640]  hear, that's your answer to your question. I like it. I like it a lot. All we got to do is convince
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:07.780]  Nick. Yeah, let's do it. Why not? It have to be two sided though, because one of the things that
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:13.420]  have to be flipped to the other side. Yeah. Go to flip. Yeah. Go to other wheel. Yeah. Go to other
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:18.300]  wheel. Yeah. 100%. Now I thought you were about to pitch the choose your own adventure vinyls,
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.380]  which that's I'm not on board for that. This is fine. I'm fine with one vinyl where you needle
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.480]  drop. I feel like the choose your own adventure pitch kind of morphed into this by the end. You
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:31.300]  guys steered me away from the choose your own adventure thing. And you were right. I think
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:36.940]  this is a better version. I'm fine. I'm fine with this idea. If we want one vinyl of for an hour,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.360]  we just record things that we just record responses. To be fair, these are not Andrew's
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.160]  20,000 things. These are responses to a wheel. These would be wheel items. Next question comes
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.800]  from William McLaughlin. How difficult is it to manage production slash release cycles,
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.500]  given the spontaneous nature of the group, i.e. a person has a good idea in an episode or other
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:03.980]  video? What's the scheduling like for getting that content created and released before everyone
[01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:10.720]  forgets? I think that's the thing we're working on. It took us three months to fucking record this
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:15.980]  episode of sausage talk. Yeah, it's it's a work in progress. I started pushing it in early November.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.440]  It shifts if there's a thing that you really want to push off the ground. Like for me,
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.540]  the advent calendar was something I really wanted us to do. And so all of my focus was on that.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:31.000]  So the premise of like trying to get anything else was just not viable. And it'll be interesting to
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.800]  see with you guys if there are things like that with the advent calendar for you or you kind of
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.580]  use like a bigger thing, just trying to push it to get made. I feel like every once in a while,
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:45.020]  there's an idea that's just so good. Everybody is equally invested and on board. And then it just
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:50.640]  gets pushed to the top and just gets made as quickly as possible. Next question comes from
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.540]  Taylor Bolton. Would love to know whether you find it easier to market regulation with the
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:06:01.760]  name change, like more search hits, viewers, etc. Now that you're not stuck behind the SEO minefield
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:07.380]  that was F***face. I feel like just not having asterisks is a huge improvement when it comes to
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.860]  just being able to say the show name is nice. Just casually. I've had a lot of people have come up
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:17.360]  to me. Not maybe a lot, but I've had a few people come up to me in person and thank me for changing
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.280]  it or thank us for changing it to a name that they can tell their family about. Yeah, I've appreciated
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:26.420]  it. Like, yeah, it's been nice. Oh, do you think what do you think, Eric? I mean, we don't really
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:31.980]  do any marketing. We definitely don't. So like in terms of like what the marketing is, it's like
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:37.020]  there's not much of a difference, but it's easier to sell ads. It's easier to get to work with other
[01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:42.680]  companies that are like they're more apt to look at our numbers and then they see the name and they
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.640]  don't think twice about it. Where before you look at the numbers, you see the name and you go,
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:53.720]  we can't advertise on that. And so it's a move on from there. But I think it's a way better,
[01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.440]  I think regulation podcasts, way better name than F***face ever was. I also like that we
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:05.260]  we verbicized it. So it still lives on when we F***face ourselves. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.820]  there's still nuggets of that stuff. I just think we were at a company that never named anything
[01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:14.880]  well. So the first thing we did was pick a good name for something and then, you know,
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:18.840]  shot into the stratosphere. So I feel good about it. Tying into sort of the next question from
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.260]  Stockholm Child Kicker. Were there any other potential names going around during the rebrand?
[01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.380]  Was calling it Andrew ever on the table again? I don't think it was ever really on the table to
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.780]  begin with. And I don't I don't think we had any other. Well, you came up you came up with this
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:38.420]  podcast name. I did. Years before we used it. It's true. And in that moment, we all fell in love
[01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:42.120]  with it. So we always knew that was going to eventually be the name of the podcast. Yeah.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.700]  I mean, it's nice that that is such a clean experience, but it would have been just if there
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:53.100]  were like sessions of us trying to pitch name, that would have been so chaotic. I would have
[01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:57.780]  loved to have known what would have come out of that. I wish we had a more compelling answer than
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.720]  we had an alternative and we just went with that and we were all happy with it.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.840]  But that is what happened. Next question by Nina Hart. What has been your biggest
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.860]  reward and challenge running your own company versus operating under a parent company?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.560]  I don't know how to like quantify challenge like it's endless challenge.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.480]  It is. Yeah. Paying ourselves. Yeah. I think the most rewarding thing has been seeing
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:27.400]  the community grow and how much support we have in a one to one basis where you don't
[01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:32.060]  think we saw that previously. I think that's the most rewarding thing to me is seeing the people
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:35.800]  come out of the woodworks and kind of support us and stick with us as we kind of keep going.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.800]  That's been really fantastic because you just sort of put it out there and you have no idea.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:44.420]  I mean, speaking for this and for 100% Eat, people go like, I love that podcast. And you go,
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:50.820]  right, but how much? Because we're about to find out. And I think we've seen a lot.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.500]  I think it's more than seeing it, right? It's the feeling it, right?
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:58.700]  Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. You definitely feel it. The challenge is there's no safety net. I mean,
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:03.520]  we've talked about that a lot, but the challenge is like, if we don't do it, it doesn't get done.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:10.880]  And if you burn out, that's too bad. Like that is, we're running it like a sprint and it's really
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:17.520]  hard to do that. And you have to be really mindful. I didn't take any time off really until this trip
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.440]  to Mexico since we launched. And that's eight or nine months of running. You're running a marathon
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:30.500]  and a sprint. And it's like, I have to be way more mindful of that for myself, of having to,
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:35.160]  I want to put everything that I have into this, but if I give everything that I have,
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:41.060]  then I don't have anything left to give later. And that's been a really hard thing where I can't,
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:47.280]  there's nothing to, sometimes there's just like nothing to delegate to somebody when there's a
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:54.160]  need to do. It's, it's hard to, it's hard to get it done sometimes. Or when you have,
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:58.000]  when it's the fifth most important thing on your list, but other people it's number one or number
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.380]  two. Sure. I think that's the hardest thing. That's very well said. I just also remembered
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:06.500]  another thing that I loved since we started this company from the previous question.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.820]  I loved how such a dull recording as the kicker repicker turned into something
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:19.440]  so off the rails and how we will just all in on it. Like, think about that after we've sold
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:26.360]  a thousand vinyls of the, of the wheel, look back and you'll be like, Andrew threw out a rule change
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:32.660]  in part two of a video that turned into a record that people buy potentially down the road. As
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.760]  soon as we go that route, you know, like that's fucking crazy. It was just a rule change.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.260]  It goes into the joy of like people being willing to just do stuff.
[01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:47.020]  We're on the surface. It makes sense to do like a mid season revisit and just sort of like recap.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:51.560]  And then it became a thing of like, well, we need to solve this problem of some of us don't
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.460]  have kickers at this point. What's the mechanism behind it? And I went into that going like,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.340]  I don't really know. Like I was messaging Eric being like, what, like, what makes sense?
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:05.640]  Like, how will this even work? And then I told you that we shouldn't do the thing that you wanted
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.700]  to do. And you went, yeah. And then did it. I don't remember that conversation going that way,
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:15.840]  but the point being that that was the thing that I even went into going like, I don't really know
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:18.500]  this is going to work. We're just going to figure it out. We're going to throw things out there.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:22.700]  We'll see what happens. And it turned chaotic in an unbelievably fun way.
[01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:26.660]  I do think genuinely the most challenging thing, at least on my end,
[01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:32.560]  is the fact that we started a company with three Americans, a Brit and a Canadian,
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.200]  and it's very hard to pay ourselves. And it's very hard to get health care. And all of this
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:46.420]  annoying behind-the-scenes grown-up shit is just constantly... it's always in a state of almost
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:51.840]  done. And when you get past a step, there's another thing you have to do, or there's another
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.640]  series of forms that you have to fill out by the end of the year, or there's another...
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:02.840]  I feel like we must be embezzling money 80s style through the Cayman Islands. We have so
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:06.040]  many companies we've had to create just so that we can all be in a business together.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.100]  It's like it's all very above the board and legal. We're not. But it's just like it is so
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:17.040]  complicated to run the behind the scenes of running something as simple as five sub-intelligent
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:23.580]  people talking for an hour and five minutes about movies and food. Yeah. You know? Absolutely.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.880]  Who says you can't be the topic of conversation for all the right reasons?
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.720]  The Hyundai Tucson Hybrid pairs bold presence with advanced technology and sleek style.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.200]  It's everything you didn't know you needed in an SUV and then some.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:43.060]  OK, Hyundai, visit HyundaiUSA.com to learn more.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.560]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.360]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:01.520]  sugar cold foam. Available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.860]  Eric posted a screenshot. Do you think a mechanic should exist in the GigaPicker
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:09.360]  that allows someone to steal a player from someone else? I feel like if we do it again,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.020]  we should add a wrinkle like that. Right. That was you very politely saying no.
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:17.460]  Correct. Yeah, I didn't interpret it that way at the time.
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.420]  Great. That was... So you were saying for the next pick-up, not for the re-picker.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:29.360]  Uh-huh. Yes. Do we know who won that, by the way?
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.020]  I need to go in and check because I think there's an issue with the site. Somebody...
[01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:36.820]  We have a member in our community that has like updated with the movie league and the kicker stuff
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.500]  and they do such an amazing job. I need to confirm because that was such a chaotic recording.
[01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:46.580]  I think I have seven kickers on the site and I don't know if that's on purpose where everyone
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.300]  else is six. Like, I just... I've been meaning to revisit that and then lock in.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.380]  Okay. I mean, if we want to have a look at it right now, me and Andrew are tied.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:55.980]  There's no way. It was a tie?
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.540]  749 and 749. Yeah, but Andrew has an extra character.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.300]  Yeah, I think I've got an extra kicker.
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.760]  Yeah. So, you know, just saying.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.420]  And do we know that... do we know that Eric's count is even correct?
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:09.520]  We should probably go look into that.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.200]  What count? My count of what? This isn't my count. I didn't make this website.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.820]  Mine was wrong for one week and the guy was like, oh,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.640]  I had the aggregate thing was wrong and he had to change it and fix it.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.060]  Why did you say Eric's count? What did Eric do?
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:23.720]  Because yours could be wrong.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.040]  I thought you were saying like, I was the one who was counting the points.
[01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.560]  No, no, I was saying the count for your kicks.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.140]  We don't know that your kicks are correct is all I'm saying.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.360]  Well, also, to be fair, Eric did botch a lot of the movie draft with his
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.960]  not assigning and not taking away points and the total pot was wrong.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:44.860]  I don't remember that, but we'll get to the bottom.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.040]  I would have won the movie draft or something.
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.920]  Yeah, that's right. I'm pretty sure it would have come in first.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.640]  But that's another thing I like about how we're always on board to just take
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.340]  the video in whatever direction it goes.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.800]  And then we basically just hand it off to the audience
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.240]  and members of the community build these websites.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.140]  Oh, that's so cool.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:07.360]  I even saw someone made a slider that they can slide from one to ten about
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.900]  how the episode is going and then graphs it all out.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.220]  That's amazing.
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.580]  I'll say just like one other quick thing about a joy of, you know,
[01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.100]  just being us as a small company.
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:20.540]  There's a meeting.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:26.640]  I just put this together relatively recently as, you know, now thinking about the past.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:32.020]  I took a meeting and it made no sense for like why we had to have this meeting
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.560]  and the information that came from it.
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.400]  Like it just it had no value.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.620]  But at the time, you know, like you're just moving and it's like whatever that happened.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.040]  And then realizing now that that had to take place for somebody to
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.940]  show a boss that they did X thing.
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.100]  Like the fact that there is all this procedure and time wasted around
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.680]  just having to establish that work was done as opposed to what could have just been
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.420]  like a two minute.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.020]  We're doing this right?
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:15:59.860]  Yes.
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.640]  Just not having to deal with that.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:03.760]  No time waste.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.860]  And that way is so nice.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.200]  So rewarding.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:07.660]  Yeah.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:10.240]  No, this could have been an emails in our company.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:11.040]  Yes.
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.600]  The last question for Misa Soup 247.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.920]  Does Andrew still have his get out of Greg free card?
[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.500]  Boy, do I.
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:24.400]  And man, am I thinking about using it on the podcast that we recorded yesterday.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:30.880]  I was laying in bed last night going, do I use it?
[01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.520]  Because I have a feeling that I might need to.
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:36.220]  So how does it work?
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.460]  You would apply it next episode and say it was for the previous episode.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:41.820]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:46.360]  I will have already taken all of the abuse by the time it applies.
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.640]  I don't know if it counts.
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.460]  What if you play it on our socials right before the episode comes out?
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.600]  Maybe we'll see.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.100]  Yeah, I'm thinking about it.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:55.900]  I'm considering.
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:17:01.960]  What if we just record a little intro that's right before the podcast that Nick can stick
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.560]  on the front of it.
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.140]  It's just like you saying, hey, this is Andrew.
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.880]  I just want to let you guys know before you listen to this.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.900]  Not that there's a reason to, but just, you know, I just felt like using my get out of
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:14.800]  Greg free card this week.
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:16.100]  Enjoy.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.880]  I'm going to put a little bit more thought into it.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.860]  But I do feel it should work like money in the bank and wrestling, where you can just
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.060]  run and deposit it whenever you want to, essentially.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.020]  Like, that's how in my head I need to get out of Greg free card.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.000]  When did you actually get it?
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:33.520]  What was it for?
[01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.120]  I don't remember, but it's been years and I've been so scared to ever use it because
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.480]  I don't trust myself ultimately.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.000]  Is it just you that has to get out of Greg free card?
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.960]  Yeah, I don't remember how I got it, but I think I'm the only one that has.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:46.680]  Interesting.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:48.120]  It was something I did.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.080]  I think there was something.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:49.880]  Oh, you know what?
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:51.980]  I remember now it was for getting the tuxedo.
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.420]  I was the only one that went to that.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.400]  I took care of it and I was below the budget.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.520]  That's how I earned it.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.880]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:01.520]  That's a good call.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  We'll see if it gets played.
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.820]  People listening to this will know there's no lead in to the next episode.
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.300]  And those are my questions.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.660]  I don't know if you guys have anything else you want to wrap up on.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.600]  I feel like we've covered quite a bit, but I don't have everyone's itinerary in front
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.240]  of me, so I don't know.
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:20.180]  Anything else you guys want to expand on in the sausage talk?
[01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.540]  I think we wanted to pitch those two ideas to you, if you don't mind.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:25.180]  Please.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.900]  I want to say we came up with like five new ideas in Mexico,
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.400]  one of which definitely can't be discussed right now.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.280]  Okay.
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.660]  Then the one I pitched yesterday in podcast, which was the birth year movie draft.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.540]  In addition to that, we came up with an idea for a predictions draft called
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.220]  Are We Nostradamus?
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.780]  Where we do, we go through and we do it snake draft style as we do.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.200]  Each person gets to pick a prediction of something they think is going to happen
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:58.180]  in the world in 2025.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:05.240]  Then in January of 2026, we reconvene and do a video where we say,
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.900]  Were We Nostradamus?
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:11.020]  And then we find out how many of our predictions come true.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.340]  And it can be anything, you know, like,
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.060]  I think Gavin or Nick said John Mulaney dies.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:17.880]  Oh my God.
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:21.140]  But it could also be like, I said a cruise ship crashes.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.980]  But it could be a good thing too.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.380]  I love this.
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:26.080]  Maybe somebody undies and then everybody's happy.
[01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:30.620]  But yeah, we just come up with our predictions or a few extras because we may overlap.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.440]  And then we put it out in the universe and we see how prescient we are.
[01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:35.620]  I think that's a lot of fun.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:36.900]  Yeah, I can't wait to film that.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.600]  If anyone gets any right, I mean, it'd be insane.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.820]  Oh, it's crazy, isn't it?
[01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:44.940]  Imagine that we do pick John Mulaney dies and then John Mulaney dies.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:46.160]  Like, that's crazy.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:47.700]  That would be crazy.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:52.480]  If we get anything right, we get to release a shirt that said,
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.920]  Yep, we're Nostradamus.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:00.680]  And who's the shirt for us?
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.880]  We'll buy it.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:02.560]  Oh, okay.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:06.280]  I think Jeff just really wants a shirt that says,
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.640]  Yep, I'm Nostradamus.
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.680]  What if the winner, if you get something right,
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.500]  you get a Greg card?
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.680]  Oh, I like that.
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.960]  Oh, that's interesting.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:15.820]  That's a good idea.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.180]  Maybe there could be a whole structure, kind of like,
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.500]  did you guys ever watch the Bozo the Clown show when you were a kid?
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.120]  Yes.
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:23.980]  Well, Eric's going to know this then.
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:28.280]  I actually did a things to do in Saints Row, the third based off of it.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.820]  But they would put a bunch of buckets out in a row, one to five.
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.520]  And there was a prize in each bucket.
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.420]  And then a kid would get a ping pong ball.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:38.980]  And if he could throw it in the first one, then he got a shot at the second.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:40.760]  And then if he got to the third, he had a shot at the third.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:44.520]  So maybe there's like, if you get one prediction correct,
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.280]  you get a get out of Greg free card.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:50.160]  And if you get two, there's like an even better gift or reward.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:52.560]  And three and four and five and like five would be insane.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:54.180]  Or four, I think, would be max.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.980]  Maybe if you get two, you get the Greg card.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:00.760]  But if you get one, you just get like a shot in the dark of a Greg.
[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.860]  You have an opportunity to roll a sheer shot in the dark.
[01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:19.430]  I am so on board with all of us having a shot in the great dark card for any.
[01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:24.790]  Oh, and it has to be used like survivor where you get one and you have to pull it.
[01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:26.290]  And there's a one in seven.
[01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.130]  And if you're right, then you just you've won the argument.
[01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:31.510]  Yeah, everyone has to back down.
[01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:33.890]  Yeah, everyone has to just put their weapons down.
[01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.090]  Even the whole community has to be like, yeah, he was right.
[01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.810]  Everybody has. Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:39.190 --> 01:21:39.970]  That's so funny.
[01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:45.730]  Oh, that would be so infuriating for somebody.
[01:21:46.290 --> 01:21:49.190]  I'm just to use it efficiently.
[01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:51.290]  Oh, that would be so frustrating.
[01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.750]  Potentially.
[01:21:52.190 --> 01:21:54.450]  It's like those fucking state farm commercials.
[01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:56.970]  I think their state farm or the couple is arguing.
[01:21:56.970 --> 01:21:59.690]  And then one of them pulls out a challenge flag and throws it down.
[01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:02.370]  And then something they bring out of the video unit and they get to watch
[01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:04.950]  the conversation that just happened to see if the husband said the thing or not.
[01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.890]  Oh, it's fucking great.
[01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:13.210]  What I'm really excited about with Are We Nostradamus is we're at the time of year where
[01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:19.470]  very specific podcasts do their predictions going into the next year and recap what they made before.
[01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:23.030]  Like I listened to a boxing podcast and I just listened to an episode of this.
[01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:25.370]  That is such a specific field.
[01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:28.330]  And I would say 80% of their predictions were wrong.
[01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:33.730]  So the premise of it just being any topic, any anything is going to be so insane.
[01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:36.330]  That's what was so funny to me when Jeff was pitching it.
[01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:37.650]  Because I was thinking like, oh, you know,
[01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:41.690]  there could be like a war or like a natural disaster or like maybe a volcano goes off.
[01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:44.210]  And then he was like, what if a cruise ship crashed?
[01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:45.970]  Pffft.
[01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:47.930]  It could be anything.
[01:22:48.210 --> 01:22:49.130]  So specific.
[01:22:49.730 --> 01:22:50.150]  I like it.
[01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:54.830]  I was I was looking at cruise ships on the horizon at night from our from our balcony.
[01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:57.290]  You could see the like just the lit up cruise ships in the distance.
[01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:59.950]  And I was thinking, man, those things got to crash sometime, right?
[01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:04.870]  It's hard to turn one of those around on a dime, you know?
[01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.670]  Oh, for sure.
[01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:07.710]  And what was the other idea?
[01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:09.250]  Oh, the other ideas.
[01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.050]  Eric will probably have to jump in to help.
[01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:17.270]  But we it's a couple of ideas that kind of morphed into one.
[01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:19.730]  We're going to call this the Wheel of Decades.
[01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:20.250]  OK.
[01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:21.650]  And we create a wheel.
[01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:29.810]  And on the wheel, the options are 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s.
[01:23:29.950 --> 01:23:31.710]  And then we spin the wheel.
[01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:35.950]  And whatever decade we land on, let's say we land on the 80s.
[01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:39.310]  We all then do our own research.
[01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:44.390]  We look, we Google, and we find all of the TV shows from the 80s
[01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:46.630]  that sound interesting that we've never seen.
[01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:48.570]  It's important that you've never seen it.
[01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:52.010]  And then we compile a list and we look at the group together.
[01:23:52.210 --> 01:23:55.450]  And then we find the show that none of us have ever seen,
[01:23:55.530 --> 01:23:56.750]  like the Six Million Dollar Man.
[01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:57.770]  Nobody ever watched it.
[01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:03.490]  Or maybe, I think the idea Eric used was Renegade, right?
[01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:04.630]  The Lord of the Lamas show.
[01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:08.130]  Or Pacific Blue, which is a show I'd never heard of that he showed me.
[01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:11.430]  It's like cops on fucking scooters or something.
[01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:12.330]  It's like Baywatch on bikes.
[01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:13.730]  Yeah, it's like Baywatch on bikes.
[01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:16.910]  And then we identify and then we pick the show, right?
[01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:20.430]  And then we become the biggest fans in the world of that show.
[01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:23.370]  And we all get together and we watch it together.
[01:24:23.370 --> 01:24:25.850]  And we watch an entire season together.
[01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:29.270]  And then we record a watch-along style content of it.
[01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:32.850]  And then we release it once a week or whatever for the audience.
[01:24:33.330 --> 01:24:35.490]  And then they can go watch it along with us, essentially.
[01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:41.050]  And it's just us consuming an entire run of a show that none of us have ever seen before.
[01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.850]  And we get to experience it all together for the first time.
[01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:44.370]  I love it.
[01:24:44.490 --> 01:24:46.370]  And we do just great watch-along content.
[01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:47.590]  I think that's so much fun.
[01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:51.850]  The thing that I really like is us spinning the wheel.
[01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:58.450]  And then at the same time, everyone independently looking up shows from that decade.
[01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:00.610]  But we are all still recording together.
[01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:03.650]  So then we're just putting them onto a sheet or whatever.
[01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:07.150]  And then we're kind of whittling down as we go.
[01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:08.170]  Like, oh yeah, this or that.
[01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:10.670]  We should listen to this or we should watch that or whatever it is.
[01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:11.470]  It's great.
[01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:13.430]  I think that would be great Patreon stuff.
[01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.690]  Like putting that on Patreon, these watch-alongs or whatever.
[01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:18.890]  So everyone can watch with us if they want to.
[01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:19.630]  I think it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:21.470]  And then it has a beginning and an end.
[01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:22.890]  It's a self-contained thing.
[01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:27.310]  It makes sense for it to end because it's an eight-episode season or a 19-episode season
[01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.670]  or whatever.
[01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:31.010]  So it's an additive thing that we throw up.
[01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:36.230]  But because it begins with an end in sight, I don't think people would be upset when it's over.
[01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:38.570]  It was just an extra thing that we got.
[01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:40.270]  And then we can always do another one down the road.
[01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:42.430]  Or if we like it enough, we can go on to season two.
[01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:44.270]  Or we can spin the wheel again.
[01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:49.210]  And it just becomes a way for us to hang out in the evening and watch something together
[01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.910]  in a fun way and make the kind of content that we love to make.
[01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:55.730]  Because we all love to do the watch-along stuff or the commentary stuff on movies.
[01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:59.250]  And also in a structured way that is something we can give to the audience.
[01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:00.210]  Completely agree.
[01:26:00.570 --> 01:26:01.430]  Yeah, I think that's so much fun.
[01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:02.330]  I'd love to do that.
[01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:03.950]  Gavin, what do you think of the Wheel of Decades?
[01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:04.770]  Love it, I'm in.
[01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:06.230]  Sounds like we're going to do it.
[01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:07.030]  I said, yeah, hell yeah!
[01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:12.590]  All right, I think those were the only things we wanted to pitch.
[01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.310]  Yeah!
[01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:14.190]  I'm excited.
[01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:15.730]  What a fun sausage talk.
[01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:17.850]  That's how some of the sausage was made.
[01:26:17.850 --> 01:26:18.530]  That is...
[01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.730]  Look at that.
[01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:20.070]  Nom nom!
[01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:22.130]  Um, I'm good, thanks.
[01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:24.370]  You can, you can nom nom it, I guess.
[01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:29.190]  Nick, you want to take us out on the nom nom?
[01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:33.170]  Do you think if a sausage was long enough, could I...
[01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:38.750]  If Eric chugged ketchup, right, and then I took a really long dog,
[01:26:40.210 --> 01:26:45.110]  put it all the way down to the stomach, could I dip it in ketchup and pull it back out?
[01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:45.990]  In Eric?
[01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.610]  Yeah.
[01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:47.130]  Yeah.
[01:26:47.970 --> 01:26:51.610]  Why was that important to specify, Nick, that it was in me?
[01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:53.490]  Well, you're shorter than us.
[01:26:58.690 --> 01:27:00.770]  It's the shortest distance to travel.
[01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:06.370]  What if I was mostly back like Andrew, though?
[01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:11.390]  What if one person was ketchup and the other was mustard?
[01:27:12.930 --> 01:27:14.530]  And then you're eating this?
[01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:18.090]  You got mad when I showed the cake that was kind of wet.
[01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:21.010]  Yeah, why did you turn into Gigi Allen all of a sudden?
[01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:24.530]  Good question.
[01:27:26.410 --> 01:27:28.610]  Well, thanks for listening to Sausage Talk.
[01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:31.070]  I think this has been insightful.
[01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.970]  This was a good one.
[01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:36.130]  I thought that there was a lot here, a lot going on, a lot to discuss.
[01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:39.250]  If we missed anything, become a falcon and ask a question,
[01:27:39.370 --> 01:27:41.070]  and then we can cover it on the next one, I guess.
[01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:46.050]  Uh, guys, anything that we want to leave everyone with as we kind of like wrap this up?
[01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:49.230]  Thank you so much for supporting us and allowing us to continue to do this.
[01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:50.170]  Thank you!
[01:27:50.530 --> 01:27:52.950]  I like your Q&A idea as well. I think that should be the next one.
[01:27:53.110 --> 01:27:53.690]  The what?
[01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:56.310]  Andrew was saying do it like a dedicated Q&A.
[01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:58.110]  Oh, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[01:27:58.550 --> 01:28:00.870]  That's a great idea. Answering the questions is a lot of fun,
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.050]  and the questions are always super interesting,
[01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:07.190]  and they think to ask things we don't think to talk about naturally, which I appreciate.
[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:08.030]  That's awesome.
[01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:09.070]  So we should definitely do that.
[01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.870]  Sounds like a plan.
[01:28:10.150 --> 01:28:12.310]  But until then, thank you so much for listening.
[01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:13.510]  Have a great rest of your day.
[01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:14.150]  Bye!
[01:28:18.610 --> 01:28:20.590]  First practice is almost here.
[01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:25.610]  Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports equipment at Play It Again Sports.
[01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:28.670]  Plus, get paid on the spot for outgrown items.
[01:28:29.130 --> 01:28:34.510]  It's the sustainable way to shop and sell for football, soccer, golf, hockey, and more.
[01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:36.010]  Play It Again Sports.
[01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:37.710]  Your back-to-school go-to.
