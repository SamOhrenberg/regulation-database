[00:25.700 --> 00:31.720]  Hello and welcome to our newest supplemental concept idea, Regulation Takes.
[00:32.060 --> 00:33.580]  I am hosting this.
[00:34.000 --> 00:34.800]  I can't believe it.
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.160]  I am joined alongside Eric, Gavin, and Nick.
[00:39.620 --> 00:41.120]  I'm excited to hear some takes.
[00:41.180 --> 00:43.760]  Let me explain the takes format before we get going.
[00:44.140 --> 00:49.040]  We have all prepared takes, which are stances in which we feel passionate about.
[00:49.400 --> 00:52.700]  We will share our takes one at a time.
[00:52.700 --> 00:54.060]  I'm not sure how many we'll do.
[00:54.220 --> 00:55.240]  This is the first time we're doing it.
[00:55.360 --> 00:56.980]  Who knows how long this is going to be?
[00:57.400 --> 00:58.420]  We'll have to figure that out.
[00:58.520 --> 00:58.940]  You'll see.
[00:59.040 --> 01:00.240]  I guess you'll know going into it.
[01:00.260 --> 01:00.760]  You'll see the timer.
[01:01.120 --> 01:01.880]  But we don't know.
[01:02.400 --> 01:03.620]  So we'll all say our takes.
[01:04.020 --> 01:07.300]  Then after this comes out, I will put out a poll on our Patreon,
[01:07.800 --> 01:09.240]  which is the regulation pod.
[01:09.600 --> 01:11.700]  And you can vote on who had the worst take.
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.640]  And whoever has the worst take or takes gets the idiot flag till the next episode.
[01:17.120 --> 01:17.780]  Dean the idiot.
[01:18.240 --> 01:18.960]  But it's not a draft.
[01:19.480 --> 01:20.640]  It's not a draft.
[01:20.700 --> 01:20.980]  No.
[01:21.360 --> 01:21.920]  I'll be honest.
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.600]  I was like 80% sure you were somehow going to call a blindside and we'd be doing
[01:27.900 --> 01:30.980]  ratty because this sounds like a fake idea.
[01:31.580 --> 01:34.100]  Oh, this is so far from a fake idea.
[01:34.580 --> 01:38.260]  This is like the most popular idea in any show format ever.
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.440]  Yeah, this is a I could tell it was a real Andrew idea
[01:42.440 --> 01:46.660]  because this is the closest we're going to get to like sports media.
[01:47.420 --> 01:48.180]  You know what I mean?
[01:48.180 --> 01:49.180]  This is so close.
[01:49.740 --> 01:56.460]  Hot take, first take, like that kind of thing that it read is true to me all the way.
[01:56.740 --> 01:58.260]  Well, until we do a March Madness bracket.
[01:58.800 --> 01:59.720]  Right, true.
[02:00.000 --> 02:02.440]  Yeah, but this is again, not a draft.
[02:02.700 --> 02:05.980]  The first thing Gavin asked when he got here today, is this a draft?
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.460]  We reassured him.
[02:07.900 --> 02:08.700]  No, it's not.
[02:09.100 --> 02:10.000]  The pool is takes.
[02:10.420 --> 02:15.360]  Yeah, yeah, the pool is takes, but also there's no real pool because it's not a draft.
[02:16.520 --> 02:20.460]  Um, so Andrew, how many takes are I mean, we'll go one at a time,
[02:20.500 --> 02:23.600]  but how many takes are we going to be giving each?
[02:23.840 --> 02:24.640]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:24.700 --> 02:27.440]  I don't know how long it'll take for us to go through everybody's takes.
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.380]  It'll be interesting to see.
[02:28.600 --> 02:30.000]  So maybe we'll do one each.
[02:30.060 --> 02:31.280]  Maybe we'll do two each.
[02:31.660 --> 02:36.980]  We will state our take and then you can sort of defend or maybe people just agree.
[02:37.460 --> 02:39.360]  And that's the support of the take.
[02:39.880 --> 02:45.060]  This is a thing I largely wanted to do because I have a take that I think about all the time
[02:45.060 --> 02:49.300]  that I don't know how else to put it like there's this can't be a draft.
[02:49.640 --> 02:51.600]  This isn't really a podcast subject.
[02:51.900 --> 02:57.620]  So I had to create a show around being able to discuss this take.
[02:58.060 --> 03:00.160]  I need a show.
[03:00.220 --> 03:01.340]  I have an opinion.
[03:01.600 --> 03:03.820]  We need a vehicle to discuss this opinion.
[03:04.240 --> 03:06.020]  It's an opinion I have not heard often.
[03:06.100 --> 03:09.760]  But how do we determine the order of delivering these takes?
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.180]  Well, you should go first because you built a show around your take.
[03:12.240 --> 03:14.060]  Yeah, I absolutely think you should go first.
[03:14.060 --> 03:19.320]  I think we could also go in discord order, which is just our names in order here,
[03:19.340 --> 03:20.660]  which appears to be alphabetical.
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.480]  So maybe we just go that way and we'll see how it goes.
[03:24.620 --> 03:25.620]  Now you mentioned a timer.
[03:26.000 --> 03:26.820]  Is there a timer?
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.780]  No, not a timer for the take, but I just don't.
[03:29.860 --> 03:32.740]  Maybe like somebody's take will take four minutes to do.
[03:32.820 --> 03:33.620]  Maybe somebody's will take.
[03:33.920 --> 03:34.580]  Oh, OK.
[03:34.840 --> 03:36.820]  Like, I just wanted to make sure I didn't have to run it.
[03:36.920 --> 03:37.400]  No, no, no.
[03:37.560 --> 03:38.100]  You don't have to.
[03:38.200 --> 03:40.820]  This isn't like a strict debate format or anything.
[03:40.960 --> 03:41.680]  I don't know.
[03:41.740 --> 03:43.480]  Gavin didn't even know if this was a draft or not.
[03:43.480 --> 03:45.780]  So I just don't know if that's my only question.
[03:46.120 --> 03:46.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:46.840 --> 03:47.660]  Gavin rebuttal.
[03:47.940 --> 03:48.100]  Yeah.
[03:50.860 --> 03:53.540]  Andrew, why don't you lead us off with your first take?
[03:53.960 --> 03:57.540]  My first take is something I think about all the time.
[03:57.760 --> 03:59.320]  It's a weird thing to think about all the time.
[03:59.500 --> 04:00.080]  I'll acknowledge that.
[04:00.500 --> 04:02.960]  But it is something I think about quite frequently.
[04:03.640 --> 04:07.440]  My first take is that Taylor Kitsch deserves better.
[04:08.080 --> 04:13.740]  Taylor Kitsch has one of the worst acting careers in modern times.
[04:13.780 --> 04:15.860]  And I don't think it's his fault at all.
[04:16.020 --> 04:16.840]  I think he's pretty good.
[04:17.320 --> 04:19.060]  I think he's a solid actor.
[04:19.660 --> 04:22.900]  He was on Friday Night Lights, which is incredibly popular.
[04:23.400 --> 04:27.900]  And he has a run of things that just like were terrible,
[04:27.900 --> 04:30.400]  but not terrible because it was his fault.
[04:30.820 --> 04:36.580]  My first example of this is he got to be Gambit in X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[04:36.580 --> 04:37.480]  He was Gambit.
[04:37.540 --> 04:42.460]  And he was fine as Gambit, but that movie was terrible.
[04:42.860 --> 04:45.280]  And like nothing expanded beyond that.
[04:45.760 --> 04:48.160]  It was a weird thing to read about the history of it,
[04:48.200 --> 04:51.660]  where they always wanted Channing Tatum, but he was always busy.
[04:51.920 --> 04:54.500]  And so they booked him because it's like he wasn't available.
[04:55.040 --> 04:57.540]  But they gave him a three movie deal, which did not happen.
[04:58.080 --> 05:02.180]  There was only a singular cameo because nobody liked X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[05:02.540 --> 05:05.580]  Yeah, a beloved character in a beloved series of films.
[05:05.580 --> 05:08.460]  I think this is the most hated one by far.
[05:08.540 --> 05:13.400]  Oh, he just happened to be in the worst Wolverine that they could possibly make.
[05:13.800 --> 05:17.080]  You created an entire show for that take?
[05:17.740 --> 05:18.800]  No, I'm not done.
[05:19.340 --> 05:19.900]  I'm not done.
[05:20.380 --> 05:21.180]  Let me establish more.
[05:21.380 --> 05:26.840]  Right. And to be fair, it will still be the same take as he continues to argue this.
[05:27.100 --> 05:28.700]  So the answer to your question is yes.
[05:28.900 --> 05:30.140]  I'm just solidifying the take.
[05:30.680 --> 05:33.280]  Right. And so the answer to your question is yes, Gavin.
[05:33.820 --> 05:36.980]  We often talk about 1994.
[05:37.280 --> 05:38.580]  Amazing Jim Carrey here.
[05:38.900 --> 05:39.680]  One of the best years.
[05:39.820 --> 05:40.500]  Oh, big film.
[05:40.960 --> 05:41.380]  Rene Atkinson.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.180]  Three absolute bangers.
[05:43.720 --> 05:49.880]  Taylor Kitsch had maybe the worst version of that where he had a 2012.
[05:50.800 --> 05:52.040]  2012 was really bad.
[05:52.120 --> 05:56.140]  John Carter from Mars, Battleship and Savages.
[05:56.620 --> 05:57.600]  All three of those.
[05:57.840 --> 05:58.600]  Not his fault.
[05:59.120 --> 05:59.240]  Yep.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.480]  John Carter was terrible.
[06:00.760 --> 06:02.160]  It was just like a soulless CG.
[06:02.160 --> 06:03.080]  It just was weird.
[06:03.160 --> 06:04.180]  There's no heart to it.
[06:04.600 --> 06:06.500]  Nobody came out of John Carter looking good.
[06:07.940 --> 06:09.600]  Battleship, absolute disaster.
[06:09.980 --> 06:11.440]  Just a terrible film.
[06:11.700 --> 06:12.680]  Not his fault.
[06:13.380 --> 06:17.820]  Savages, an Oliver Stone movie that had like all the pieces to be good.
[06:17.880 --> 06:21.280]  Like you'd understand from the outside wanting to be in an Oliver Stone movie as a lead.
[06:21.700 --> 06:23.900]  All the acting in that movie is great.
[06:23.960 --> 06:24.520]  All around.
[06:24.700 --> 06:27.060]  Just a really dumb, bad story.
[06:27.480 --> 06:28.180]  Yeah, not great.
[06:28.180 --> 06:33.800]  Savages has like Benicio Del Toro and Aaron Taylor Johnson and stuff like that.
[06:33.900 --> 06:35.260]  Like it has like a bunch of people.
[06:35.740 --> 06:36.180]  Yeah, it is.
[06:36.260 --> 06:41.880]  It is a weird thing where I would argue he was the only one impacted by the failure of Savages.
[06:42.060 --> 06:43.360]  100% absolutely agree.
[06:43.960 --> 06:49.340]  John Carter was like this also $300 million Disney movie that was terrible.
[06:49.860 --> 06:51.060]  It just nobody saw it.
[06:51.140 --> 06:52.000]  It was a huge flop.
[06:52.300 --> 06:54.820]  It was a summer flop for Taylor Kitsch.
[06:54.820 --> 07:01.580]  And I feel like that completely broke the wings off of what his career trajectory could be.
[07:01.760 --> 07:04.580]  But he hit the fade into the distance.
[07:04.720 --> 07:08.500]  And so he was he went he went quiet for a little bit off the grid.
[07:08.780 --> 07:09.320]  We went dark.
[07:09.420 --> 07:11.180]  He then came back.
[07:11.260 --> 07:13.900]  I mean, he had Lone Survivor, which was like it was fine.
[07:14.740 --> 07:17.940]  But then he got booked on True Detective season two.
[07:18.220 --> 07:21.400]  True Detective, the biggest show of that year.
[07:21.820 --> 07:22.860]  Everyone's loving it.
[07:22.920 --> 07:24.140]  It's a critical darling.
[07:24.140 --> 07:27.020]  They're running it back for season two.
[07:27.620 --> 07:28.900]  Everyone's so excited.
[07:29.300 --> 07:31.340]  And then everybody hated season two.
[07:31.820 --> 07:39.200]  Yeah, it is the worst reviewed season of True Detective with a 61%.
[07:39.820 --> 07:42.440]  Once again, he was totally fine.
[07:42.460 --> 07:43.460]  And he was good.
[07:43.560 --> 07:45.980]  I would say good performance by Taylor Kitsch.
[07:46.420 --> 07:51.040]  Just everything he touches is the worst version of that thing.
[07:51.100 --> 07:53.220]  But it is in no way his fault.
[07:53.820 --> 07:57.960]  He should be in most of the action roles that John Krasinski has had
[07:57.960 --> 07:59.320]  in like the last five years.
[07:59.620 --> 08:01.240]  Like he would be so much better.
[08:01.460 --> 08:05.680]  And all these sort of I'm not saying that he's an Oscar winning actor and that
[08:06.020 --> 08:09.240]  he should have been in these epic dramas.
[08:09.240 --> 08:13.200]  But like any kind of generic John Krasinski action movie,
[08:13.200 --> 08:15.600]  I think he would have been significantly better.
[08:15.820 --> 08:19.580]  Oh, I think that he's the reason his career is what it is,
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.960]  is because of Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.740]  He that that role is filled by Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[08:24.880 --> 08:28.540]  If Aaron Taylor Johnson did not exist, this guy's working.
[08:28.720 --> 08:30.940]  This guy's working everything without him.
[08:31.020 --> 08:35.960]  It has been an interesting he's had to go on like Netflix type series
[08:35.960 --> 08:37.460]  and he's building things back up.
[08:37.720 --> 08:42.400]  But I just think it's it's such a weird career where everything that he did,
[08:42.440 --> 08:44.540]  like I understand, accepting and being like,
[08:44.580 --> 08:46.260]  yeah, I'm going to be in a fucking Wolverine movie.
[08:46.460 --> 08:47.620]  I'm going to be in this.
[08:47.620 --> 08:51.280]  I'm going to be the lead of a Disney epic for like 400 million,
[08:51.380 --> 08:52.880]  like a huge box office movie.
[08:53.080 --> 08:55.780]  But none of it worked and none of it was his fault.
[08:56.300 --> 08:57.700]  And I just think that's incredibly fascinating.
[08:58.360 --> 09:01.720]  The king of good franchise, like stick out stinkers.
[09:02.100 --> 09:05.900]  Like he's always in the most dog shit version of the actual product.
[09:06.340 --> 09:11.120]  Absolutely. And I just I think it's such a fascinating career trajectory.
[09:11.620 --> 09:14.360]  If you gave me an infinite amount of time and
[09:15.320 --> 09:18.500]  500 million different guesses on what your take was going to be,
[09:18.500 --> 09:20.460]  I still wouldn't have come up with it.
[09:20.540 --> 09:23.980]  No, no, absolutely. He created a show, Gavin.
[09:24.200 --> 09:26.600]  He created a show so he can explain this to us.
[09:27.220 --> 09:29.180]  I think everyone is going to have fun takes.
[09:29.280 --> 09:32.040]  It's just I think about Taylor Kitsch's career a lot.
[09:33.400 --> 09:37.160]  I've never heard of in a bunch of movies and shows I've never seen.
[09:38.180 --> 09:39.460]  It deserves better.
[09:40.220 --> 09:42.640]  You tell me you're not a big Friday Night Lights head.
[09:43.220 --> 09:43.780]  Never seen it.
[09:43.780 --> 09:48.780]  You weren't into the Texas high school football teen drama?
[09:49.080 --> 09:49.880]  I guess not.
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.380]  I guess it never spoke to me.
[09:51.960 --> 09:52.460]  It was great.
[09:52.720 --> 09:54.000]  I'd highly recommend the show.
[09:54.080 --> 09:57.080]  There's an actor in the show that feels like he's not an actor,
[09:57.080 --> 09:59.000]  and they just made a show around him.
[09:59.860 --> 10:00.960]  And he's wonderful.
[10:01.260 --> 10:03.380]  Highly recommend it just for his performance alone.
[10:04.100 --> 10:06.740]  Not Taylor Kitsch, but he runs like a car dealership.
[10:06.960 --> 10:07.560]  And he's great.
[10:09.060 --> 10:10.560]  Taylor Kitsch also very good in the show.
[10:11.100 --> 10:11.960]  But that is my take.
[10:11.960 --> 10:15.180]  Taylor Kitsch deserves so much better than he got.
[10:15.460 --> 10:18.300]  And I'm happy to see that he's getting a little bit of a resurgence.
[10:18.520 --> 10:21.460]  I think Taylor Kitsch is exactly where he probably needs to be.
[10:21.620 --> 10:22.760]  I don't think that there's...
[10:23.420 --> 10:28.900]  I'm not clamoring for, dude, the other guy from the Savages to be in.
[10:29.360 --> 10:31.900]  Because you didn't get to see him in those roles.
[10:32.500 --> 10:33.580]  That's what I'd argue.
[10:33.920 --> 10:37.360]  I think he could be a dynamic, fun action star.
[10:37.540 --> 10:39.420]  And we just never got that.
[10:39.420 --> 10:42.920]  I think that if TV was still around,
[10:43.040 --> 10:49.340]  this guy would be Spike TV hero of whatever show is on Spike TV.
[10:49.520 --> 10:53.080]  Like, this is a cable actor.
[10:53.880 --> 10:55.620]  That is what this guy reads to me.
[10:56.080 --> 10:56.640]  I mean, that's fair.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.080]  I mean, that's certainly where he's found his most success.
[10:59.580 --> 11:02.780]  Yeah, but he was Gambit.
[11:03.560 --> 11:05.800]  He was Gambit for four minutes.
[11:05.800 --> 11:07.260]  He was Gambit.
[11:08.580 --> 11:10.040]  Four minutes of Gambit.
[11:10.380 --> 11:11.940]  I guess I have seen him as Gambit.
[11:12.480 --> 11:12.660]  Yeah.
[11:13.040 --> 11:13.720]  And that's about it.
[11:14.340 --> 11:19.080]  And like, I feel like he's the only person from like this Deadpool Wolverine era that we're in,
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.580]  where they're bringing everybody back.
[11:20.660 --> 11:21.820]  He's never going to get brought back.
[11:22.260 --> 11:22.500]  No.
[11:22.740 --> 11:24.720]  Well, did they bring back the guy who was the blob?
[11:25.080 --> 11:25.400]  No.
[11:26.140 --> 11:27.240]  What about Will.i.am?
[11:27.360 --> 11:28.860]  Will.i.am wasn't in anything else.
[11:29.320 --> 11:30.340]  No, that's fair.
[11:30.860 --> 11:33.580]  Should your take be that Will.i.am should be in more X-Men movies?
[11:34.020 --> 11:34.420]  No.
[11:35.200 --> 11:36.520]  I didn't think he was that good.
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.800]  Oh, but Taylor Kitsch was?
[11:40.220 --> 11:40.920]  Yeah, he was fine.
[11:41.200 --> 11:41.940]  He was solid.
[11:42.560 --> 11:45.660]  I think you should edit Taylor Kitsch's next reel.
[11:46.020 --> 11:46.220]  Yeah.
[11:46.780 --> 11:51.740]  I think you should reach out and see if Taylor Kitsch has any hot takes he wants to give,
[11:51.820 --> 11:53.160]  because I bet you could get him.
[11:54.700 --> 11:55.580]  See what I can do.
[11:56.220 --> 11:58.480]  Maybe you can help him get on an Australian morning show.
[12:00.900 --> 12:03.640]  He's nice, just promoting our podcast.
[12:04.740 --> 12:07.720]  I think if it was based on how it worked with Gavin,
[12:07.820 --> 12:09.920]  he'd be promoting Friday Night Lights, the show.
[12:15.350 --> 12:16.470]  How did it all start?
[12:17.270 --> 12:18.270]  How'd you get into acting?
[12:20.090 --> 12:20.890]  Oh, man.
[12:21.850 --> 12:22.610]  Well, that's my take.
[12:23.130 --> 12:26.370]  Eric, what is your take if we're going in Discord order?
[12:27.090 --> 12:28.450]  Your take was so interesting.
[12:28.550 --> 12:30.770]  I don't find mine to be as interesting, but...
[12:30.770 --> 12:31.850]  Yeah, I feel kind of dumb.
[12:31.970 --> 12:32.170]  Yeah.
[12:32.350 --> 12:33.090]  No, no, I don't.
[12:33.250 --> 12:34.210]  I definitely don't feel dumb.
[12:34.290 --> 12:36.470]  I definitely feel like, I don't know.
[12:36.470 --> 12:37.430]  We'll see how my takes...
[12:37.990 --> 12:39.430]  Yeah, I'm not sure I did this right.
[12:39.950 --> 12:42.030]  No, I'm so excited to get to Gavin's.
[12:42.170 --> 12:42.910]  I'm just blowing through mine.
[12:43.370 --> 12:48.870]  My take is that the take of there are too many podcasts
[12:49.630 --> 12:55.150]  is a hack take from people who would kill to have a podcast.
[12:55.750 --> 12:58.530]  You hear it all the time.
[12:58.810 --> 12:59.650]  There are too many podcasts.
[12:59.850 --> 13:02.390]  We should put tariffs on podcast equipment.
[13:03.150 --> 13:08.390]  It's a hack take from hack people who...
[13:09.390 --> 13:10.710]  It's the low-hanging fruit.
[13:10.950 --> 13:12.210]  It's the easy punching bag.
[13:12.690 --> 13:14.370]  Do I love how many podcasts there are?
[13:14.530 --> 13:14.850]  No.
[13:15.210 --> 13:21.810]  But the more podcasts that come out, the more listening hours are consumed monthly,
[13:22.190 --> 13:28.190]  month on month since podcasts have become a large source of entertainment.
[13:28.190 --> 13:32.010]  I don't think there are too many podcasts.
[13:32.390 --> 13:36.970]  I don't think it should discourage anyone from starting a podcast.
[13:37.150 --> 13:42.510]  I think anyone with some ideas and everything can do this.
[13:42.910 --> 13:47.090]  I think that it's a lot easier to have the take online of there are too many podcasts
[13:47.090 --> 13:49.910]  than there are to try it yourself and see if you're successful.
[13:50.190 --> 13:52.090]  That's where that take comes from.
[13:52.230 --> 13:54.510]  And if you were to give those people microphones,
[13:54.730 --> 13:57.990]  they couldn't fucking wait to make three episodes and abandon it.
[13:58.190 --> 14:02.530]  That is the true way of podcasts is that.
[14:03.290 --> 14:07.970]  I think just because they are so popular and trending in such a big way,
[14:08.110 --> 14:14.950]  it's just an easy thing to say, but nobody really truly believes it by and large.
[14:15.210 --> 14:15.790]  Can I ask you a question?
[14:16.350 --> 14:17.070]  That's my take. Yeah.
[14:17.510 --> 14:18.890]  How many podcasts do you work on?
[14:19.430 --> 14:20.810]  I have right now.
[14:20.910 --> 14:24.670]  Well, Good Morning Gus is actually coming out right now.
[14:24.750 --> 14:27.770]  So there's one, 100% E, and there's this one.
[14:28.190 --> 14:32.050]  Uh, we also have Creating Character, which you can check out.
[14:32.330 --> 14:34.030]  Yeah, I didn't say promote them all. I'm just looking for a number here.
[14:34.830 --> 14:37.310]  We can say four. I think four feels good.
[14:37.550 --> 14:39.370]  Yeah. Interesting.
[14:40.130 --> 14:45.750]  I agree with the take only because like, I think it's a weird situation in which,
[14:46.070 --> 14:48.790]  sure, there are too many podcasts, but like, who cares?
[14:49.430 --> 14:50.210]  Like, why is that a problem?
[14:50.210 --> 14:51.830]  And there's also too much TV and too much radio.
[14:52.390 --> 14:54.430]  It's on all the time. Everything's on all the time.
[14:54.430 --> 14:59.170]  Yes. I think that the, there's too many podcasts thing is just an easy thing to like,
[14:59.250 --> 15:03.450]  tweet out and be like, that's right. I'm above this. And it's like, okay.
[15:03.550 --> 15:07.210]  I will say there are a lot of the same guy making the same podcast.
[15:07.490 --> 15:10.470]  There are, there are. There's also a lot of YouTube channels.
[15:10.910 --> 15:15.870]  And I think having the take in 2025 that there's too many YouTube channels is the same thing
[15:16.790 --> 15:21.750]  as there are too many podcasts, but that'll be in the next few years when the next sort of wave of
[15:21.750 --> 15:29.150]  whatever entertainment comes out. I don't think it's necessarily so groundbreaking or
[15:29.930 --> 15:35.290]  really correct that there are too many podcasts. I think that shouldn't discourage anyone from
[15:35.290 --> 15:39.270]  picking up a mic and giving it a try. That doesn't mean you're absolved from consequences
[15:39.270 --> 15:43.190]  of things. It just means that I don't think that there are too many.
[15:43.390 --> 15:48.130]  I think there's a lot more stories to be told out there that people could be doing or saying.
[15:48.130 --> 15:53.850]  I think three guys who just went to a, uh, like a bar and coming home and then they don't have
[15:53.850 --> 15:58.910]  anything to say, but then get on a mic. That's what people think a podcast is, but that's not
[15:58.910 --> 16:04.230]  necessarily what you get from a lot of this stuff. So that's my take. There are not actually too many
[16:04.230 --> 16:08.510]  podcasts. I think it's also a thing of like what you expect to get out of the podcast that you're
[16:08.510 --> 16:13.230]  making. Yeah. Like if you're, let's say maybe there's a philosophical thing of like, I'm going
[16:13.230 --> 16:20.430]  to get into podcasting and make a ton of money. That is not an easy or like a realistic thing to
[16:20.430 --> 16:27.350]  expect. Uh, there are so many podcasts, like just the, I mean, that is like a, from a budgetary or
[16:27.350 --> 16:32.770]  like a marketing standpoint of ads and all that. Like, sure. But if you're just making a podcast
[16:32.770 --> 16:37.690]  because you want to do it and you think it would be fun, like it seems absurd to be like, no, no,
[16:37.750 --> 16:42.470]  no, no. Too many. You can't do it. Not allowed. That's how I feel about it. That's my take.
[16:42.470 --> 16:48.070]  I do respect the person that's making it. Also having that take though, because I feel that way
[16:48.070 --> 16:51.890]  all of the time of like making a show and then being like, why the fuck am I doing this? I got
[16:51.890 --> 16:57.870]  nothing of interest to say. I don't, this, there's more qualified people should be making these
[16:57.870 --> 17:03.150]  things. It is wild that I can just do this, but yeah. But anyone can. And I think that's what's,
[17:03.230 --> 17:08.530]  I think that's what's cool about it is that anyone can. It really is. It is very, it is very like
[17:08.530 --> 17:14.910]  2009 YouTube. Yes. To go out there and just do it. Because without, without podcasts,
[17:14.970 --> 17:19.590]  how would we know about Jack's exotic bird? That's such a good point. The world would know.
[17:20.130 --> 17:24.970]  You all would just have to hoard that knowledge. Yeah. Yeah. We would have to do just like the
[17:24.970 --> 17:30.490]  20 people at that party would know about Jack's exotic bird and not so, so, so many more. And I
[17:30.490 --> 17:36.610]  need as many people as possible to know about Jack's exotic bird. And that's the magic of podcasts.
[17:37.210 --> 17:43.310]  It really is. I'm so excited for when we record our next episode. I watched a movie and it opened
[17:43.310 --> 17:48.610]  up a whole new thing of lore for me that I'm very excited to share. It's fun. It's fun. It's sort of
[17:48.610 --> 17:53.390]  a joy of podcasting is you will do something for yourself and then it will create an opportunity
[17:53.390 --> 17:57.010]  to discuss something in a way you never anticipated. Yeah. Can't wait to share.
[17:57.890 --> 18:04.830]  Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas. It's
[18:04.830 --> 18:09.430]  everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on with mind-blowing

[18:28.070 --> 18:32.470]  If this were a Reese's TV ad, you'd be staring at a Reese's peanut butter cup.
[18:32.470 --> 18:38.030]  And sure, my voice is peanut buttery smooth, but still, you need to see the peanut butter cups,
[18:38.090 --> 18:46.570]  right? No? I can really just say Reese's and you'll go get some? Okay. Reese's. Reese's. Reese's.
[18:46.750 --> 18:56.150]  Really working, actually. Reese's. Reese's. This... I'm onto something. Reese's. Reese's. Reese's.
[18:56.810 --> 19:02.730]  Reese's. Well, um, Gavin, those are our first two takes. What about you? What takes do you have?
[19:03.050 --> 19:06.610]  If you manage to fit it in your arsehole, you should be allowed to smuggle it.
[19:09.390 --> 19:15.050]  Okay. Interesting. Very interesting. But you've got the trouble of putting it in your anus.
[19:15.910 --> 19:22.950]  It should just be anything goes in the anus. Interesting. Okay, so if I... if I'm bringing
[19:22.950 --> 19:30.290]  in a bunch of drugs and they catch me, let's say, but it's in my anus, I'm no longer going to be
[19:30.290 --> 19:34.930]  penalized for attempting to smuggle drugs? Yeah, I mean, you put it in your own anus.
[19:35.110 --> 19:39.430]  You went through the trouble of that. They're yours. Is there a consideration, though,
[19:39.430 --> 19:43.910]  that putting something in an anus is maybe too easy to it be an immunity spot?
[19:45.490 --> 19:49.570]  It's sort of like a bag. I mean, you got a lot of runway there. You can lube it up.
[19:49.570 --> 19:56.510]  It depends on... I guess what I'll say to that is that's big talk from someone who's not doing it.
[19:59.590 --> 20:05.350]  I guess. I don't know. I feel like... here's the thing, and this is going in a direction that I
[20:05.350 --> 20:12.190]  didn't anticipate going. I've had some pretty massive shits which give me a concept of what's
[20:12.190 --> 20:17.410]  possible in there. I've never... I'm not putting things in. I'm pushing stuff out.
[20:17.410 --> 20:24.510]  I just don't agree. I feel like it doesn't deserve complete immunity.
[20:25.150 --> 20:29.010]  You feel like you would have an advantage because you could smuggle a much bigger item than me?
[20:29.610 --> 20:34.250]  I don't think it's like... I'm not bragging or anything. I'm not saying I have an abnormal
[20:34.250 --> 20:43.670]  like anus stretch ability. I'm not like fantastic for anally. But I do think that it might be...
[20:43.670 --> 20:49.670]  it feels like it could be too... I don't know. It's an interesting take. What were you thinking
[20:49.670 --> 20:55.170]  of smuggling? There's a lot of people getting their anuses looked at by other people, isn't it?
[20:55.250 --> 20:58.170]  Sure. Getting stuff taken from their own anus.
[21:00.150 --> 21:05.890]  I just feel like that should be a safe space for people. You can't smuggle a lot. It's not like
[21:05.890 --> 21:13.310]  you could smuggle a boatload of heroin. Just enough for you. I think you'd be surprised how
[21:13.310 --> 21:18.050]  much heroin. I think it would be a lot. I think it'd be like a lot more than you think it would
[21:18.050 --> 21:22.270]  be in that case. Let's say then that it's only for the stuff that went up. It's not for the
[21:22.270 --> 21:28.050]  stuff you swallowed. What? I didn't even think about what you're saying, but I assume that was
[21:28.050 --> 21:34.030]  a rule. I assume it has to be the entry point of anal as opposed to swallowing. Yeah, because you
[21:34.030 --> 21:39.130]  can swallow a lot more than you can put up. At that point, your take would just be anything
[21:39.130 --> 21:46.010]  inside of you is fair game. I'm confused about what could be swallowed that you would smuggle.
[21:46.450 --> 21:50.350]  Heroin. Well, no, because I think your stomach would definitely break that down and you would
[21:50.350 --> 21:54.150]  die. Yeah, you don't swallow the raw heroin. You would put it in a Johnny, wouldn't you?
[21:54.530 --> 21:59.890]  Right. But even still, you don't think the risk of swallowing... I just don't think it would pass
[21:59.890 --> 22:07.150]  through you. That was a movie thing. Of course it would. I've definitely seen a thing where
[22:07.150 --> 22:11.790]  someone swallowed a bunch of heroin and one of the bags burst. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about,
[22:11.930 --> 22:18.010]  is that. I just feel like the risk of swallowing it and it bursting is so much higher than just
[22:18.010 --> 22:22.790]  sticking it up. Because I agree. I think if you swallow it, no fair game. But if you put it up,
[22:22.890 --> 22:26.870]  fair game. I wouldn't be using it for drugs, though. I'd be using it just to avoid importing
[22:26.870 --> 22:37.130]  something. Like what? Like what? Yeah. I don't know, like a small but high value item. I don't
[22:37.130 --> 22:43.490]  fancy a ring or something. I'd put it in my arse and then I wouldn't have. Yeah, like say I went to a place
[22:43.970 --> 22:48.910]  where the ring was cheaper to buy. I'd buy it, pop it in my arse and travel back with it.
[22:49.650 --> 22:52.250]  Couldn't you just wear it? That's a bad example.
[22:56.070 --> 23:00.210]  Are you just are you just trying to put stuff? What are you talking about?
[23:01.110 --> 23:05.870]  Christopher Walken did it. Yeah, Christopher Walken did do it. He put a watch in his arse?
[23:05.870 --> 23:13.870]  Yeah. In Pulp Fiction. Oh, the whole monologue. Yeah. What about this? What if it's OK? So let's
[23:13.870 --> 23:20.490]  say you smuggle something legally through your arse. OK, then you pop it out of your arse and
[23:20.490 --> 23:25.770]  commit a crime with it. Is that crime also legal or is? No, no, no. It's not like a golden bullet.
[23:26.110 --> 23:30.570]  It's not a golden bullet situation. It's just what you know. What made me think of it was,
[23:30.610 --> 23:34.650]  you know, in Left 4 Dead, you got like the safe houses where zombies just can't affect you.
[23:34.650 --> 23:39.410]  It's your moment to chill. It's your safe space. You're guaranteed that nothing bad is going to
[23:39.410 --> 23:45.130]  happen until you open the door. I just want a real life safe space. And what better space than my
[23:45.130 --> 23:51.470]  natural God given pocket? But I keep I keep wondering, like, what do you like? What do you
[23:51.470 --> 23:58.570]  mean about having stuff up? Like what is your example of stuff? Lump of gold. OK, but why is
[23:58.570 --> 24:05.050]  it? But why do you have to do that, I guess, is my question. Like, I don't know. I just wanted a
[24:05.050 --> 24:11.410]  place that no one would ever look. But they do look. Yeah, that's my point. They shouldn't. Do
[24:11.410 --> 24:15.350]  they have to manually look still? I feel like we should be at a point with technology that they
[24:15.350 --> 24:19.110]  could just tell if you have something in your arse or not. I like the idea of getting put in the
[24:19.110 --> 24:23.270]  in the x-ray and they can see the watch in there. They're like, oh, you little rascal. You put it
[24:23.270 --> 24:32.430]  in your arse. Go on. Get out of here, you. Yep. Yeah. With their watch. Yep. Now, OK, let's just
[24:32.430 --> 24:36.830]  expand on this for you personally. Yeah. Let's say that this was a socially acceptable thing.
[24:36.890 --> 24:39.950]  What do you think you would just carry in it whenever you went out? Would it be something
[24:39.950 --> 24:46.330]  you regularly used? I'm trying to think. Nothing. I've never like I've just always been scared of
[24:46.330 --> 24:50.930]  moving stuff between countries that I own because I'm like, oh, they're going to like think I've
[24:50.930 --> 24:55.730]  bought that and I'm illegally importing it. And I just want the security of my arse.
[24:55.890 --> 24:59.730]  But I can't or I also couldn't fit like an Xbox in my arse and stuff. Yeah, that would be a problem.
[25:00.230 --> 25:05.810]  That would have to be several flights and piece by piece. I like this take because it's truly insane
[25:05.810 --> 25:11.190]  and I keep asking for examples and I don't feel like I'm getting any. So I'm really on board for
[25:11.190 --> 25:15.810]  this. I'll be honest, I can't think of a single item that I would actually use this on. I just
[25:15.810 --> 25:22.410]  think people who put stuff up their arse to go through to go through passport checks and stuff,
[25:22.610 --> 25:27.590]  they've gone through a lot. A lot of effort involved. It just it feels like the worst
[25:27.590 --> 25:34.290]  surprise you could have. Yeah. Like if we went out on a picnic and I was like, oh man, I forgot.
[25:34.590 --> 25:38.390]  I forgot to bring dessert. And you're like, don't worry, I got some cookies right here.
[25:38.450 --> 25:43.990]  Just give me a second. Why would he do that with cookies? I was just thinking like a bag
[25:43.990 --> 25:49.910]  of cookies, like a why? Why? Right, right. Why would he do that with cookies? Why is he storing
[25:49.910 --> 25:54.830]  anything in his anus? Because it seems like it's illegal to get it by getting this from country
[25:54.830 --> 26:00.590]  to country. He started arguing. You're talking about using it, but he's saying a safe place
[26:00.590 --> 26:05.470]  where people won't go. That makes sense for maybe potentially illegal activities. What you're saying
[26:05.470 --> 26:13.310]  is we go on a picnic and he pulls Oreos out of his ass. He did mention that he just wants to use his
[26:13.310 --> 26:20.190]  God-given pouch or whatever. I don't know what the wording was. I don't know what he said, but it was
[26:20.190 --> 26:25.510]  something about he wanted to use his anal pouch. So at the point in which he just wants to use it,
[26:25.570 --> 26:31.290]  then I think you have to like, it becomes a day to day thing for him. Does it? Gavin, does it feel like
[26:31.290 --> 26:35.110]  it becomes a day to day thing to you? No, I don't need to use it every day. I'd hardly ever use it.
[26:36.190 --> 26:40.110]  This feels like a really weird thing to fight for then, if it's something you don't want to really
[26:40.110 --> 26:45.510]  Okay. What about this? What about this, right? Okay. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping.
[26:47.090 --> 26:53.990]  Get some of those melatonin gummies, right? To help me sleep. But I don't think you're allowed
[26:53.990 --> 27:00.310]  to bring those to England. So whenever I come to England, I'm all like insomnia and stuff. If I
[27:00.310 --> 27:04.630]  just pulled a week's worth of gummies out of my ass, fine. I also don't know if they're checking
[27:04.630 --> 27:09.150]  for those. I would have no idea if they'd actually confiscate that. That's the world I want to live
[27:09.150 --> 27:13.810]  in, is that you're smuggling things anally that you don't have to, but just assume aren't allowed.
[27:14.030 --> 27:20.950]  I like that reality a lot. Can I bring melatonin from the U.S. to the U.K.? Not finding a clear
[27:20.950 --> 27:27.110]  answer. First comment, it's not illegal to bring in. It's just illegal for someone to sell to you
[27:27.110 --> 27:33.730]  in the U.K. without a prescription. Okay. Second comment, yes, you can bring it. Third comment,
[27:33.730 --> 27:41.470]  you can order melatonin over the internet into the U.K. from the U.S. I bring a tub home every
[27:41.470 --> 27:49.230]  time I go. Now imagine how embarrassing it is if he's huddled over a toilet while reading this.
[27:52.330 --> 27:57.770]  Wow. I think I like your take. I don't think I like any of your uses for the take. I think
[27:57.770 --> 28:03.430]  that's the thing. I like the idea of my take, but not only do I not know what I put in my ass,
[28:03.430 --> 28:07.830]  I've never experienced putting anything in my ass, apart from the occasional woman's finger.
[28:08.270 --> 28:13.870]  Sure. You've never had like a... what's the word I'm looking for? They put the tube in your ass.
[28:14.690 --> 28:19.610]  Medical procedure. Like a colonoscopy? Colonoscopy, thank you. You've never had one of
[28:19.610 --> 28:29.870]  those or like an enema? No. Nope. No, just a finger. Just a... just a surprising finger.
[28:35.870 --> 28:39.630]  I... I'm gonna be thinking about your take all day, Gavin. That's all I'm gonna be thinking
[28:39.630 --> 28:42.690]  about for the rest of this day. Look, I told you I thought I've done this wrong,
[28:42.950 --> 28:46.230]  so I don't know why you... No, no, no, but you didn't. I don't think you did it wrong. No,
[28:46.310 --> 28:49.630]  I don't think you did it wrong at all. It's just a wild... I really, truly don't think you did it
[28:49.630 --> 28:55.890]  wrong. Yeah, I... yeah. I don't think I've ever heard Nick so confused in the background.
[28:56.450 --> 29:04.990]  It's very exciting. I'm just... I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled about this. So great. But that's
[29:04.990 --> 29:09.710]  Gavin's take. That's pretty exciting. Nick, we have your very first take.
[29:11.130 --> 29:18.170]  I feel... well, that... what an act to follow. I feel that I'm gonna take some heat for this.
[29:18.850 --> 29:22.770]  In fact, I know I'm gonna take heat for this because I believe I am very much in the minority
[29:22.770 --> 29:31.410]  on this. I would like to say that the inverted control scheme is the correct control scheme.
[29:31.410 --> 29:35.890]  You're insane. You're an idiot. That's terrible. I think we talked about this. You're nuts. Like,
[29:36.030 --> 29:40.630]  I think Gavin made a comment about something we played recently and saw that you did inverted
[29:40.630 --> 29:44.430]  controls and thought you were crazy. So does that mean, Nick, that when you get in a vehicle,
[29:44.530 --> 29:48.890]  like a plane in a video game or a Banshee or something, are you now not inverted or
[29:48.890 --> 29:53.570]  you inverted on both? Inverted on both. It makes no sense. What do you mean? I mean,
[29:53.650 --> 29:59.430]  think about how your head moves. Yeah, I move my head. It's moved by my neck up and down. It's not
[30:00.030 --> 30:04.650]  flown like a plane. No one's steering my head with a stick through the back of my head. But
[30:04.650 --> 30:09.050]  when you tilt your head to look up, you're tilting your head backward, which is the way that you're
[30:09.050 --> 30:13.710]  doing it on the controller. Yeah, but there's no stick coming out the back of my head. No one's
[30:13.710 --> 30:18.610]  got a thumb on a stick on the back of my head. Fine, fine. Gavin, let's look at it from your
[30:18.610 --> 30:24.370]  perspective then. Let's talk about operating a camera. When you tilt to look up, which way do
[30:24.370 --> 30:32.450]  you pull the camera? If I tilt to look up, I push down on the stick because it's a stick coming out
[30:32.450 --> 30:37.270]  the back. You pull it back. But if the camera was on my head, you would look up. You're still
[30:37.270 --> 30:43.090]  tilting your head back. I would look up to look up. You would look up to look up. You're tilting
[30:43.090 --> 30:49.310]  back to look up. You're tilting forward to look down. You don't look back or forwards. You look
[30:49.310 --> 30:55.930]  up and down. So you invert up and down. Do you invert left and right? No, God, no, that's wrong.
[30:56.110 --> 31:00.230]  Right, but you're steering your head to the right. I don't understand what the fuck you're saying
[31:00.230 --> 31:05.990]  then. Okay, so Nick, I've got a camera, right? I want the camera to look to the right. I take the
[31:05.990 --> 31:10.650]  stick coming off the back of the camera and I move it in which direction? I turn the camera right.
[31:10.650 --> 31:15.390]  You turn the camera right by doing what? By turning it right. Yeah, by pushing the stick
[31:15.390 --> 31:20.550]  to the left, huh? If you invert your up and down, you should be inverting your left and right.
[31:22.910 --> 31:27.570]  Now that's a take right there. That is a take. I will say this. Touche.
[31:30.890 --> 31:37.110]  But also, now I'm just going to go back to the flying one. You turn lefty, you go lefty. You
[31:37.110 --> 31:45.810]  pull back to go up. You push forward, go down. So I'm going to stick with the flight controls.
[31:46.010 --> 31:55.390]  Inverted is correct, but only on the y-axis. So how did you become inverted? Halo. It's
[31:55.390 --> 32:01.110]  literally thanks to Halo. Yeah, but Halo isn't by default inverted. It's not, but I remember...
[32:02.030 --> 32:06.830]  No, but listen, they do that whole tutorial bit at the beginning where the chief comes out of
[32:06.830 --> 32:11.150]  sleep and they have you do the control thing. Like, look left, look right, look up, look down.
[32:11.230 --> 32:16.670]  And then I remember being like, well, try this up and down. And in the moment, I was like,
[32:16.750 --> 32:20.750]  I don't feel anything different. So I just went with whatever the second one was.
[32:21.870 --> 32:27.110]  And ever since then, inverted is the way to be. So why are you blaming Halo then?
[32:27.550 --> 32:28.990]  Did you only play Halo? Because it gave me the option?
[32:30.810 --> 32:34.930]  Like, I'm trying to understand. Like, I get Halo playing that way, but then you go to a
[32:34.930 --> 32:38.570]  different game and then you have to go into the settings and change it.
[32:38.890 --> 32:41.830]  Yeah, well, I mean, at that point, it was so ingrained because I played a lot of Halo
[32:41.830 --> 32:45.090]  that it was just everything else made me feel sick and slow.
[32:45.430 --> 32:48.010]  Did you not play like a first person shooter prior to Halo?
[32:48.470 --> 32:49.770]  I mean, there weren't a ton, though.
[32:50.430 --> 32:51.950]  Well, there are so many, like Doom?
[32:52.370 --> 32:53.050]  Honor Controller?
[32:53.690 --> 32:53.990]  Quake?
[32:55.650 --> 32:56.050]  GoldenEye?
[32:56.870 --> 32:58.350]  I mean, but GoldenEye was...
[32:58.350 --> 32:59.530]  I think GoldenEye was inverted.
[33:00.210 --> 33:02.530]  GoldenEye, you didn't look up or down unless you stopped.
[33:02.550 --> 33:03.370]  Yeah, unless you were aiming.
[33:03.990 --> 33:05.030]  I guess, yeah.
[33:05.550 --> 33:07.070]  Right, so you looked up and down.
[33:07.090 --> 33:09.630]  No, I mean, unless you were going through the crosshairs. Most of the time you can just shoot.
[33:09.770 --> 33:11.290]  Right, so you would look up and down.
[33:12.410 --> 33:14.470]  I would not look up and down that much in GoldenEye.
[33:14.490 --> 33:15.090]  I would never look up and down.
[33:15.190 --> 33:19.250]  Me neither. I'm not saying that I did it. I'm saying that it was there and you could do it.
[33:19.530 --> 33:20.350]  I mean, yeah, now.
[33:21.010 --> 33:22.290]  What does that mean?
[33:24.610 --> 33:25.130]  What do you mean?
[33:25.130 --> 33:30.910]  So, is your take that every game should be inverted by default?
[33:30.910 --> 33:36.110]  Yeah, and I think that people should give it a shot because it is better. It's more comfortable.
[33:36.310 --> 33:37.230]  Why would everyone...
[33:37.750 --> 33:41.870]  Inverted, the word inverted basically just means like backwards or flipped.
[33:42.210 --> 33:48.390]  It's like, it's not the default. It says there's no verted. There's normal and inverted.
[33:51.050 --> 33:54.850]  Hey, you guys playing this inverted or verted? Oh, these controls are verted.
[33:54.970 --> 33:58.750]  As someone who plays everything verted and then I swap controls with someone who doesn't,
[33:58.750 --> 34:03.790]  I'm just like, all it does for you, Nick, surely, is cause arguments from verted people.
[34:05.690 --> 34:13.410]  Well, yes, it does. And that's why I decided to be brave and tell my story about how I live my life.
[34:13.490 --> 34:14.230]  Well, let me ask you this.
[34:14.550 --> 34:16.430]  All these verts coming for you.
[34:16.570 --> 34:20.950]  Are you going to pass down this hindrance to your child?
[34:21.330 --> 34:23.030]  That's exactly what I wanted to know.
[34:23.510 --> 34:24.870]  Interesting question.
[34:25.490 --> 34:27.690]  Is he, is he going to get a choice in this?
[34:27.750 --> 34:31.110]  Are you just going to start feeding them inverted controls without him knowing?
[34:31.690 --> 34:36.010]  You know, I wouldn't have to switch the control scheme when we handed the controller off.
[34:36.190 --> 34:37.870]  Yeah, he's going to learn inverted.
[34:39.190 --> 34:40.370]  He's flying right.
[34:40.990 --> 34:43.050]  Yeah, wait, that sounded wrong. He's flying true.
[34:43.130 --> 34:45.530]  But right, but right is left, right is right.
[34:46.610 --> 34:48.310]  No, y-axis.
[34:50.410 --> 34:53.310]  This take is, I can't wait for the verts to come after you.
[34:53.310 --> 34:55.470]  I thought Gavin's take was going to get slammed.
[34:55.630 --> 34:57.210]  I definitely think Nick's take is going to get slammed.
[34:57.290 --> 35:00.290]  Well, Gavin emboldened me to be wrong.
[35:00.730 --> 35:04.490]  Yeah, I know. I played GTA with both of you. I've seen how it works.
[35:05.590 --> 35:10.670]  We should film a let's play at some point where Nick has to play verted and the rest of us all
[35:10.670 --> 35:11.550]  have to do inverted.
[35:11.730 --> 35:15.770]  That is such a good idea. I mean, I don't want to do it, but that's great.
[35:15.770 --> 35:18.710]  No, it'd be terrible, but it'd be funny for us all to suffer.
[35:19.270 --> 35:24.150]  Easier for the verteds to use inverted because we fly planes inverted in games.
[35:24.250 --> 35:25.450]  Oh, that's an interesting idea.
[35:25.550 --> 35:26.130]  But you don't fly shit.
[35:26.130 --> 35:27.470]  It's a very interesting take, yeah.
[35:27.870 --> 35:28.230]  Backwards.
[35:28.990 --> 35:29.710]  Or normally.
[35:30.450 --> 35:33.670]  Very curious. Well, Nick, great take.
[35:34.290 --> 35:36.670]  I think we could do one more take each.
[35:37.210 --> 35:39.390]  You think one more take each or do you think we wrap up at like...
[35:39.390 --> 35:43.110]  No, no, we got to do one more take each. I'm so curious to see what else Gavin has to say.
[35:43.650 --> 35:46.830]  That's fair. Do you have another take, Gavin, or do you only have one take?
[35:46.830 --> 35:48.970]  Oh, I wrote like 10. I thought this was going to be...
[35:48.970 --> 35:51.810]  Oh, that's cool. All right, then let's go back around the horn.
[35:52.010 --> 35:54.930]  Let's start with Andrew and then let's go back around the horn.
[35:55.570 --> 35:59.090]  My second take, we get one real animal movie a year.
[35:59.490 --> 36:03.450]  I know making movies with real animals isn't ethical.
[36:04.270 --> 36:09.630]  So we use CG animals now almost all the time, but it just doesn't hit the same.
[36:09.870 --> 36:12.250]  It's not as fun. It's not as entertaining.
[36:12.250 --> 36:16.950]  I think we should be allowed morally to have one film a year
[36:16.950 --> 36:19.650]  that is real animals in all of the roles.
[36:19.810 --> 36:22.950]  And it's like the big real animal movie of the summer or year.
[36:23.090 --> 36:24.310]  That is my take.
[36:24.650 --> 36:27.610]  I really have almost truly no opinion on this.
[36:28.630 --> 36:32.310]  Who's the board that decides, oh, this is the movie that gets the real animal?
[36:33.110 --> 36:38.310]  Oh, that's, you know, I think maybe it rotates by major studio each year.
[36:38.310 --> 36:44.370]  Major studio has the I don't know if you want to say right or like they've been penalized with
[36:44.370 --> 36:49.810]  making a fully real animal movie and it just rotates, but there's only one.
[36:50.230 --> 36:54.410]  And there's a lot of expectation on that movie delivering because of that.
[36:54.870 --> 36:56.150]  Because I'm sick of the CG.
[36:56.250 --> 37:00.410]  I saw a trailer for cats versus dogs three recently,
[37:00.870 --> 37:02.870]  which I didn't know is a thing they made a third of.
[37:03.270 --> 37:04.990]  And they're all CG and it looks like shit.
[37:05.310 --> 37:06.790]  That's just now they look like shit.
[37:06.790 --> 37:07.430]  What do you mean?
[37:07.650 --> 37:10.410]  Surely, eventually, 20 years from now, you won't be able to tell.
[37:10.690 --> 37:11.550]  I don't think that's true.
[37:11.670 --> 37:12.830]  I think he doesn't want to wait.
[37:13.030 --> 37:14.530]  He doesn't want to wait the 20 years, though.
[37:14.590 --> 37:15.330]  I don't want to wait.
[37:15.550 --> 37:17.410]  He wants a real cat and a real dog doing something.
[37:17.950 --> 37:20.890]  And I also, yeah, I want to know that it's a real dog playing football.
[37:21.330 --> 37:23.290]  I want a real dog running out there getting that ball.
[37:24.450 --> 37:32.030]  Dude, if if the end of Homeward Bound was CG dogs and a cat walking back home,
[37:32.050 --> 37:33.550]  it would not be as impactful.
[37:33.830 --> 37:35.350]  So maybe I agree with this.
[37:36.550 --> 37:38.930]  Oh, I think it just doesn't hit the same.
[37:39.210 --> 37:41.170]  Do you want the animal to be doing its own stunts as well?
[37:41.310 --> 37:42.570]  Or are you OK with a CG double?
[37:42.970 --> 37:45.030]  No, I want to do all right.
[37:45.110 --> 37:48.650]  Well, this might be where we this is where it becomes unethical.
[37:49.170 --> 37:53.450]  Like, say a dog, a dog has to escape a burning building from a with a zip line.
[37:55.270 --> 37:56.110]  Are you doing that?
[37:56.510 --> 37:56.930]  I don't know.
[37:56.970 --> 37:58.430]  I'm not a fucking stunt coordinator.
[37:58.430 --> 38:02.290]  How does Tom Cruise stand on an airplane with you?
[38:02.470 --> 38:06.090]  There are people that are professionals that figure out how to film that.
[38:06.290 --> 38:07.750]  Fucking now what, Gavin?
[38:09.070 --> 38:11.510]  You're asking me how do I set up a safe stunt?
[38:11.690 --> 38:12.470]  I don't do that.
[38:12.530 --> 38:15.450]  But there's an industry of people that that's their job.
[38:15.570 --> 38:16.650]  I will trust them.
[38:17.230 --> 38:19.010]  Gavin, take that and shove it up your anus.
[38:19.190 --> 38:23.010]  He doesn't give a fuck about how it's done.
[38:23.190 --> 38:24.670]  He just wants to watch the end result.
[38:26.110 --> 38:26.650]  Here's the thing.
[38:26.650 --> 38:28.350]  I want it to be done safely.
[38:28.590 --> 38:29.850]  How is it done safely?
[38:29.950 --> 38:30.710]  I don't fucking know.
[38:30.810 --> 38:31.710]  That's not my job.
[38:31.730 --> 38:33.230]  I don't live in that world.
[38:33.850 --> 38:35.750]  But there are professionals that do.
[38:37.350 --> 38:39.610]  And I trust that they will figure it out.
[38:42.530 --> 38:43.630]  Oh, my God.
[38:43.710 --> 38:44.310]  That took a turn.
[38:44.390 --> 38:48.030]  I just want a real animal movie because it's they all suck now.
[38:48.070 --> 38:49.210]  Just watch Planet Earth.
[38:49.670 --> 38:51.390]  They're not like doing goofy stuff.
[38:51.850 --> 38:55.130]  You're not going to see Bingo on trial on Planet Earth.
[38:55.130 --> 38:56.610]  Bingo on trial?
[38:56.670 --> 38:57.790]  Remember the Bingo movie?
[38:58.290 --> 38:59.350]  Something we should watch.
[39:00.090 --> 39:01.410]  He's on the stand.
[39:01.810 --> 39:07.130]  Now, are you okay with the fact that the animal is probably going to get uncomfortable and hurt
[39:07.130 --> 39:08.030]  while it's filming?
[39:08.370 --> 39:09.030]  That's the thing.
[39:09.110 --> 39:14.150]  That's why it's morally unethical and why we stopped doing this as a culture.
[39:15.170 --> 39:18.590]  But I think we can be allowed one per year.
[39:18.810 --> 39:20.030]  Did we stop doing it?
[39:20.490 --> 39:21.630]  There's still animals in films.
[39:22.430 --> 39:22.970]  Not really.
[39:23.050 --> 39:24.450]  Like, not in the way it used to be.
[39:24.450 --> 39:27.150]  He wants full animal film.
[39:27.410 --> 39:30.290]  Like, he doesn't want like, here's a section about animal.
[39:30.450 --> 39:32.010]  He wants like, full on.
[39:32.070 --> 39:34.310]  Not like, these people are riding a horse sort of thing.
[39:35.090 --> 39:35.310]  Right.
[39:35.670 --> 39:39.570]  If the movie was about the horse all the way, then absolutely.
[39:40.190 --> 39:42.530]  I want MVP 4 with a real monkey.
[39:43.030 --> 39:43.810]  That's all I want.
[39:44.390 --> 39:46.070]  I don't feel like it's a huge ask.
[39:46.590 --> 39:48.110]  But I understand it's unethical.
[39:48.390 --> 39:53.110]  When I emailed that zoo where Louis from MVP is currently residing,
[39:53.110 --> 39:58.030]  they were very clear that they do not support the MVP movies or animals in film in general.
[39:58.170 --> 39:58.950]  I get it.
[39:59.390 --> 40:00.390]  I support it.
[40:00.890 --> 40:02.290]  But yes, we could do one.
[40:02.510 --> 40:06.310]  We can do one per year and make sure it's really safe and everything's all good.
[40:06.870 --> 40:07.610]  We could do one.
[40:07.610 --> 40:08.530]  I support it.
[40:08.750 --> 40:09.150]  Outside of the one.
[40:09.150 --> 40:09.490]  And that's my take.
[40:10.250 --> 40:12.910]  One real animal movie per year should be allowed.
[40:14.350 --> 40:16.650]  That's, uh, well, there you go.
[40:17.990 --> 40:20.150]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke.
[40:20.150 --> 40:23.130]  You know that moment when you just need to hit pause and refresh?
[40:23.710 --> 40:25.630]  An ice-cold Diet Coke isn't just a break.
[40:25.850 --> 40:29.130]  It's your chance to catch your breath and savor a moment that's all about you.
[40:29.470 --> 40:30.350]  Always refreshing.
[40:30.690 --> 40:31.870]  Still the same great taste.
[40:32.270 --> 40:32.810]  Diet Coke.
[40:33.030 --> 40:34.190]  Make time for you time.
[40:36.930 --> 40:39.890]  Your earbud fell in a coffee cup.
[40:40.410 --> 40:41.770]  You need a taco.
[40:42.050 --> 40:42.970]  Pick me up.
[40:43.830 --> 40:47.290]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless taste you love.
[40:47.290 --> 40:49.550]  Paso de el paso.
[40:50.710 --> 40:51.930]  That is, that's it.
[40:52.070 --> 40:52.990]  Eric, what's your take?
[40:53.390 --> 40:53.670]  Wow.
[40:53.990 --> 41:01.270]  Um, my take is one that in my lifetime, I think has become, it was something that we
[41:01.270 --> 41:07.990]  wanted and then got, but too much of a good thing has become sort of what this thing is.
[41:08.890 --> 41:13.330]  I think my hot take is not everything needs lore.
[41:13.970 --> 41:14.230]  Oh!
[41:14.970 --> 41:19.990]  At one point in movies, a movie would just be a movie and we didn't have to know everything
[41:19.990 --> 41:20.990]  about every character.
[41:21.210 --> 41:23.430]  We didn't have to have backstories about every single thing.
[41:23.550 --> 41:24.750]  Not everything was a big franchise.
[41:25.470 --> 41:27.370]  Sometimes a movie was just a movie.
[41:27.690 --> 41:29.290]  Sometimes a TV show is just a TV show.
[41:29.430 --> 41:35.770]  And sometimes, uh, we didn't need the alternate reality game that nobody really cared about
[41:35.770 --> 41:40.810]  to put all these pieces together to solve a mystery that nobody wants for a show that's
[41:40.810 --> 41:41.850]  canceled in season two.
[41:41.850 --> 41:45.830]  But how would characters, how would a movie exist without lore?
[41:46.310 --> 41:46.790]  No, no, no.
[41:46.890 --> 41:51.230]  I'm not talking about the, what you're seeing on screen.
[41:51.370 --> 41:56.570]  I'm talking about what happens when everyone extrapolates every little detail in becoming
[41:56.570 --> 42:03.170]  the most lore focused thing where I guess my example is like, how come the timeline for
[42:03.170 --> 42:05.230]  Donkey Kong doesn't make sense?
[42:05.590 --> 42:08.610]  We don't need a timeline for Donkey Kong.
[42:08.990 --> 42:10.450]  He's Donkey Kong.
[42:10.450 --> 42:13.770]  He is the monkey and he wants the banana.
[42:14.130 --> 42:16.730]  So it's more of like a consumer thing then.
[42:16.810 --> 42:17.410]  It's like the fan.
[42:17.610 --> 42:17.750]  Yes.
[42:17.970 --> 42:18.410]  Yes.
[42:18.830 --> 42:19.130]  Okay.
[42:19.190 --> 42:22.430]  Because I don't think Nintendo are that strict with their lore.
[42:22.550 --> 42:23.150]  Like look at Zelda.
[42:23.890 --> 42:24.130]  Yes.
[42:24.510 --> 42:30.270]  And everyone is like, not everyone, but like weird nerds are pissed about, well, where
[42:30.270 --> 42:31.310]  does this fit in the timeline?
[42:32.210 --> 42:33.510]  Who gives a shit?
[42:33.770 --> 42:34.790]  So it does not matter.
[42:35.050 --> 42:38.310]  Basically, if someone's there asking like, oh, what order are the Zelda games in?
[42:38.310 --> 42:40.730]  Is this the same link from this game as it is in that game?
[42:40.730 --> 42:41.990]  Your answer is shut up.
[42:42.150 --> 42:42.950]  Shut up.
[42:43.170 --> 42:43.390]  Okay.
[42:43.510 --> 42:44.130]  Shut up.
[42:44.310 --> 42:45.350]  It does not matter.
[42:45.670 --> 42:46.430]  Play the game.
[42:46.530 --> 42:47.670]  I hope you enjoy the game.
[42:47.810 --> 42:52.650]  If there's stuff there and people want to, if the creator is like, hey, I developed it
[42:52.650 --> 42:54.470]  with this stuff in mind or whatever.
[42:54.910 --> 42:55.290]  Great.
[42:55.670 --> 42:56.110]  Whatever.
[42:56.610 --> 43:01.510]  That when people start going like, well, here's how it fits in with the Star Wars, like Star
[43:01.510 --> 43:03.290]  Wars is I guess like the big example.
[43:03.290 --> 43:09.410]  Because when I was a kid, it was all of the books and everything of like the Star Wars
[43:09.410 --> 43:10.430]  like extended universe.
[43:10.550 --> 43:13.730]  And like, you read these books and all this stuff and then they just went, no, that's
[43:13.730 --> 43:13.910]  real.
[43:14.230 --> 43:14.390]  Yeah.
[43:14.410 --> 43:15.470]  None of that's canon actually.
[43:15.910 --> 43:19.010]  And so it was like, but I read all these books and I really enjoyed them.
[43:19.150 --> 43:21.430]  And they go, yeah, none of that fucking means anything here.
[43:21.530 --> 43:22.270]  So fuck you.
[43:22.350 --> 43:23.530]  And it was like, okay, sick.
[43:23.790 --> 43:25.410]  So I guess it doesn't matter.
[43:25.550 --> 43:30.370]  And that's really what was like my turning point on not everything that you like has
[43:30.370 --> 43:33.570]  to become the biggest volume encyclopedia.
[43:33.830 --> 43:37.630]  It can just be a thing you enjoy for a little while and then you can put it away and move
[43:37.630 --> 43:41.010]  on and you don't have to know what the timeline for Donkey Kong is.
[43:41.130 --> 43:44.770]  It can just be Donkey Kong and that's fine.
[43:45.090 --> 43:50.870]  Like people trying to figure out the Mario Brothers timeline is like the craziest thing
[43:50.870 --> 43:51.510]  in the world to me.
[43:51.950 --> 43:54.490]  Mario Brothers, you go right, you just go right.
[43:54.710 --> 43:57.750]  And now you can go forward and backward that you pull back on the stick.
[43:57.870 --> 43:58.450]  Maybe you go forward.
[43:58.550 --> 43:58.870]  I don't know.
[43:58.870 --> 43:59.930]  Nix controls are working.
[44:00.630 --> 44:05.790]  Yeah, I just think the the lore focus of stuff is really, really frustrating to me.
[44:05.870 --> 44:06.510]  And I'm sick of it.
[44:06.530 --> 44:07.230]  I'm done with it.
[44:07.430 --> 44:09.230]  Now, to be clear, you're not opposed to all lore.
[44:09.310 --> 44:11.030]  You just don't think everything needs it.
[44:11.350 --> 44:11.690]  Yes.
[44:11.710 --> 44:17.250]  And I don't think that fans need to deep dive on every detail of everything like Donkey
[44:17.250 --> 44:18.450]  Kong timelines.
[44:19.030 --> 44:25.670]  That is I sometimes stupidity of lore is sometimes my favorite thing about the thing.
[44:25.670 --> 44:32.630]  Like I love I truly love and Fast and Furious how fucked up that lore is because they tried
[44:32.630 --> 44:33.830]  to make something make sense.
[44:33.970 --> 44:38.570]  And then they decided it didn't matter anyway after doing all of the work to explain it,
[44:38.570 --> 44:44.270]  where they had a very popular character die in Tokyo Drift, which was the third film.
[44:44.490 --> 44:47.750]  And then in like movie five, they're like, fuck, we want to bring him back.
[44:47.750 --> 44:48.410]  But he's dead.
[44:48.430 --> 44:49.050]  How do we do that?
[44:49.290 --> 44:54.690]  OK, we'll set five, six and seven before three.
[44:54.690 --> 44:55.930]  We'll do that.
[44:56.010 --> 45:01.430]  Like, well, this timeline is all fucked now because we want to explain how Han can be around.
[45:01.730 --> 45:03.270]  And then they do all that.
[45:03.290 --> 45:04.990]  And then we get to the point of his death.
[45:05.130 --> 45:07.250]  And then they just bring him back anyway.
[45:07.410 --> 45:09.030]  And the most recent installment.
[45:09.310 --> 45:12.450]  And it was like, well, why did you need to do any of that work?
[45:12.550 --> 45:13.810]  Like none of it actually mattered.
[45:13.870 --> 45:16.470]  He was just coming back regardless of what you did.
[45:16.930 --> 45:18.230]  None of it matters.
[45:18.610 --> 45:22.290]  But I love that they tried so hard to explain it in a way,
[45:22.290 --> 45:27.230]  maybe the only attempt to like logically explain anything in any of those movies.
[45:27.410 --> 45:29.230]  And it's just crazy that they did it.
[45:29.610 --> 45:31.490]  So I love personally lore.
[45:32.930 --> 45:37.110]  I don't... the fan feedback around it can definitely be annoying at times.
[45:37.290 --> 45:37.490]  Yes.
[45:37.550 --> 45:39.070]  I think I like it because...
[45:39.070 --> 45:39.390]  Frustrating.
[45:39.890 --> 45:44.570]  Because I grew up in a time where video games didn't look anything like the cover.
[45:45.270 --> 45:47.970]  And you have like pixels for like an enemy.
[45:48.130 --> 45:51.290]  And I would always be like, oh, I'm going to read the booklet and see what this enemy
[45:51.290 --> 45:52.190]  actually looks like.
[45:52.270 --> 45:55.230]  And I want to learn about it and why it's doing what it's doing.
[45:56.450 --> 45:57.490]  So that's interesting.
[45:58.750 --> 46:02.770]  And when I was younger, I felt the same way because we didn't have it.
[46:03.230 --> 46:05.130]  It was a thing that I was desperate for.
[46:05.490 --> 46:08.350]  I wanted more lore and every... what if all these things connected?
[46:08.730 --> 46:10.870]  And now everything's a franchise.
[46:11.230 --> 46:12.090]  Everything connects.
[46:12.270 --> 46:14.150]  Nothing can be just on its own.
[46:14.310 --> 46:17.710]  Everything has to be, well, how does this make sense with the lore?
[46:17.850 --> 46:19.130]  And it's like, this sucks.
[46:19.130 --> 46:23.530]  I just, I don't want it to go back to the amount that it was before where it was zero,
[46:23.830 --> 46:28.390]  but it cannot continue to be the amount where that it is, which is 100.
[46:28.730 --> 46:29.710]  It's too much.
[46:29.830 --> 46:31.770]  It's too much lore for every single thing.
[46:31.890 --> 46:32.410]  Yeah, I don't...
[46:33.070 --> 46:34.010]  I think that's fair.
[46:34.070 --> 46:36.110]  As long as we're okay with lore existing, I'm with you.
[46:36.530 --> 46:37.830]  Oh, yeah, I'm fine with it existing.
[46:38.190 --> 46:42.450]  I'm not fine with people being mad about Donkey Kong timeline.
[46:42.730 --> 46:44.030]  I'm never going to let that go.
[46:44.350 --> 46:46.770]  Donkey Kong timeline is like the craziest thing in the world to me.
[46:46.770 --> 46:49.050]  You care about when the Donkey Kong games take place?
[46:49.190 --> 46:49.770]  Donkey Kong?
[46:50.690 --> 46:51.490]  Donkey Kong?
[46:51.810 --> 46:53.110]  Goddamn, it makes me nuts.
[46:53.390 --> 46:53.810]  That's crazy.
[46:54.950 --> 46:55.970]  So what is that lore?
[46:56.170 --> 46:58.870]  Is Cranky Kong the original Donkey Kong or something?
[46:58.870 --> 47:01.050]  Right, but that's what people posited.
[47:01.330 --> 47:03.090]  Like, oh yeah, the original Donkey Kong is Cranky Kong,
[47:03.170 --> 47:05.890]  but then this new game is coming out and Cranky Kong's in it.
[47:05.930 --> 47:08.410]  And people are like, how can there be Kid Pauline?
[47:08.690 --> 47:12.210]  But Cranky Kong, like, there's people getting mad about like that stuff.
[47:12.230 --> 47:14.730]  And you just go, I don't, I don't know, man, who cares?
[47:15.070 --> 47:15.370]  I don't know.
[47:15.370 --> 47:17.710]  Is anyone wondering where Lanky Kong is these days?
[47:18.050 --> 47:21.190]  I don't think anybody wants that.
[47:21.330 --> 47:22.730]  He's got, he has no style.
[47:22.870 --> 47:23.790]  He has no grace.
[47:24.290 --> 47:28.270]  Is Lanky Kong the Taylor Kitsch of the Donkey Kong universe?
[47:29.070 --> 47:30.310]  None of it is his fault.
[47:30.670 --> 47:32.630]  Yeah, Donkey is Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[47:37.590 --> 47:38.290]  That's my take.
[47:38.870 --> 47:39.650]  Thank you very much.
[47:40.430 --> 47:41.910]  Gavin, so excited.
[47:42.130 --> 47:42.590]  Go for it.
[47:42.610 --> 47:43.210]  Oh, I can't wait.
[47:46.550 --> 47:55.690]  Every time the CEO of a major global corporation takes a bonus, he first has to stand in front of
[47:55.690 --> 48:01.730]  each employee one by one and tell them what his bonus is about to be and tell them how long it
[48:01.730 --> 48:07.570]  would take that employee to earn the same amount of money on their current salary.
[48:08.750 --> 48:12.230]  Just to see if after going through all that, he still wants to take the bonus.
[48:12.610 --> 48:13.210]  I love it.
[48:13.210 --> 48:16.990]  I think it can't be over a Zoom call or anything.
[48:17.130 --> 48:19.470]  It has to be in the same room, direct face to face.
[48:19.990 --> 48:23.370]  Hi, Edwin Jenkins.
[48:23.710 --> 48:32.130]  Okay, my bonus this year is $25 million and at your current salary would take you 175 years to
[48:32.130 --> 48:34.110]  earn. Good to see you.
[48:34.390 --> 48:40.890]  And just to see if being overloaded with that would cause any kind of guilt.
[48:40.890 --> 48:43.330]  I don't think it would, unfortunately.
[48:44.010 --> 48:47.910]  I think a lot of the people in these positions are kind of psychotic,
[48:49.430 --> 48:55.250]  are just void of emotion. I really like this idea. I would almost like to see
[48:55.850 --> 48:59.410]  a scenario in which they have to pitch why they deserve their bonus.
[48:59.950 --> 49:05.270]  And then it's Squid Game style where every employee has to vote by hitting a yes or no
[49:05.270 --> 49:07.650]  button, whether they receive it or not.
[49:08.810 --> 49:09.770]  I like that.
[49:09.770 --> 49:11.270]  So what if it's like a mixed vote?
[49:11.690 --> 49:12.890]  Whatever's the majority wins.
[49:13.390 --> 49:15.510]  Oh, well, no one... yeah, they would never get a bonus.
[49:16.530 --> 49:19.550]  Yeah. Well, that's why you have to state your case really well.
[49:19.890 --> 49:24.250]  Yeah, I just think this... can you imagine any corporation on the planet that would have...
[49:25.170 --> 49:29.450]  I think they wouldn't even get 10%, let alone 100%.
[49:30.330 --> 49:30.510]  Right.
[49:30.570 --> 49:31.110]  I think that's fair.
[49:31.610 --> 49:34.230]  Yeah, I think that's totally fine. Yeah, make a stronger case.
[49:34.510 --> 49:36.250]  If you're really that good and that much of a leader,
[49:36.390 --> 49:38.590]  you can make your case to these people that you deserve more.
[49:38.590 --> 49:41.670]  I could imagine a CEO walking out and being like, listen, y'all,
[49:41.770 --> 49:44.490]  I know I'm not going to get my bonus this year, so I just want to take this time
[49:44.490 --> 49:48.490]  to talk about the fact that we are not smuggling enough things anally.
[49:48.890 --> 49:51.570]  Let's get into this. This could be the future.
[49:53.130 --> 49:56.990]  I like... I like this take just because I want to see a CEO have to do that.
[49:57.210 --> 50:01.650]  I wonder if how many CEOs at the end of that experience would actually
[50:01.650 --> 50:03.770]  think twice about it or whether they'd just be like,
[50:03.890 --> 50:05.430]  and that's done with for another year.
[50:05.930 --> 50:07.030]  I think it's that.
[50:07.030 --> 50:09.570]  Do you think... I think so too.
[50:09.850 --> 50:13.710]  What part of you is going, and David Zasloff changed his mind.
[50:14.550 --> 50:21.030]  I'm also so interested to see what his compelling case is about why he deserves the bonus.
[50:21.890 --> 50:24.710]  Well, he changed his mind. They're splintering now.
[50:24.750 --> 50:30.370]  It's just like, oh man, I would love to still be an employee for that meeting.
[50:30.510 --> 50:32.890]  That would be phenomenal. Think about how many subsidiaries
[50:32.890 --> 50:36.230]  some of these companies have. They would have to come to our company,
[50:36.230 --> 50:41.230]  sit down with us and meet with Drew Saplin and every other person
[50:42.650 --> 50:45.730]  to make the case about, all right, and here's how long you'd have to work.
[50:45.990 --> 50:49.670]  Because here's what's going to happen eventually on these big companies.
[50:50.170 --> 50:53.770]  Potentially the employee will be like asking the CEO, like, well,
[50:53.770 --> 50:56.810]  what have you actually done this year? Like, what's the kind of work you've done?
[50:56.810 --> 51:00.250]  And he'll just be like, mainly standing in front of all my employees,
[51:00.390 --> 51:04.570]  telling them what my bonus is going to be. Because it would take so freaking long.
[51:04.570 --> 51:09.570]  Yep. I had the courage to rename the thing what it was originally called
[51:09.570 --> 51:13.050]  because I just, I have that vision. You're, you're welcome.
[51:14.350 --> 51:17.630]  And you're welcome. Oh man, that's a good take. I like that.
[51:17.630 --> 51:19.870]  That's really good. That's an interesting one.
[51:20.050 --> 51:21.610]  I like that a lot. Yep. Sweet.
[51:21.990 --> 51:25.630]  Okay. Nick, round us out. What is your take?
[51:25.870 --> 51:30.690]  I keep getting to follow Gavin on some pretty big, crucial takes.
[51:30.690 --> 51:37.450]  And then I get to dive bomb a little bit. So this one, I think a lot of people
[51:38.090 --> 51:41.410]  try to say that you should never put ketchup on a hot dog, right?
[51:42.370 --> 51:45.250]  Sure. Like that's a thing that I don't know if you grew up with it,
[51:45.350 --> 51:48.290]  but all the people I knew were like, you should never put ketchup on a hot dog.
[51:48.390 --> 51:54.570]  Yeah. No problem with ketchup, like on a hot dog with something else. My...
[51:54.570 --> 51:57.910]  You mean ketchup, right? I mean, you're saying ketchup, but you mean ketchup.
[51:58.890 --> 52:00.370]  Katsup? Kats... Katsup?
[52:00.750 --> 52:03.890]  Ketchup. Yeah. Ketchup. Whatever. Thank you, Gavin. Appreciate it.
[52:04.050 --> 52:08.270]  Thank you, Gavin. Okay. I also say helicopter,
[52:08.430 --> 52:11.750]  helicopter most of the time, so you want to... I never noticed that one.
[52:11.850 --> 52:14.530]  Anyway, me neither. Now I will. Oh, sweet. Glad to hear it.
[52:14.610 --> 52:17.370]  If you push forward on a helicopter, which direction does it go?
[52:18.390 --> 52:20.730]  Well, is it attached to a neck or not?
[52:23.050 --> 52:25.050]  It depends. Are the controls inverted or not?
[52:25.710 --> 52:26.470]  All right, go ahead.
[52:27.910 --> 52:35.070]  Damn it. Are they verted? My argument is that ketchup should never be alone on a hot dog.
[52:36.030 --> 52:42.610]  Ketchup has no place being the sole condiment on a hot dog because it's too sweet and takes
[52:42.610 --> 52:49.410]  away from the rest of the dog itself. If it's ketchup and mustard, you've got that nice bit
[52:49.410 --> 52:55.690]  of comparison, more the acidity of the mustard going with the ketchup sweetness, and that
[52:55.690 --> 52:59.470]  compliments the dog pretty well, right? With a relish, it's pretty good. With onion, it's
[52:59.470 --> 53:05.050]  cutting through a little bit, even if you had like chili. So my argument is ketchup alone on
[53:05.050 --> 53:11.110]  a hot dog, gross. With other stuff, good. I wonder if you're going to lose this poll
[53:11.110 --> 53:13.210]  just because of the ketchup thing. Yeah.
[53:13.230 --> 53:16.830]  Like in the same way that people get so upset when people call Mario, Mario,
[53:17.390 --> 53:20.730]  because of just that's where they... that's how they pronounce that there.
[53:21.330 --> 53:23.550]  I'm so fascinated to see the ketchup reaction.
[53:23.550 --> 53:28.430]  I also feel like never before have you said ketchup so much like catch.
[53:29.430 --> 53:33.150]  I felt like even after calling it out, you went even harder on it somehow.
[53:33.550 --> 53:35.270]  Like some of them, you were just saying catch.
[53:35.750 --> 53:36.190]  Ketchup.
[53:36.710 --> 53:36.950]  Ketchup?
[53:37.130 --> 53:38.410]  Is it ketchup? It's ketchup? Okay.
[53:38.670 --> 53:38.910]  Ketchup.
[53:39.550 --> 53:46.570]  Okay. So in the event of no condiment at all, or just plain hot dog, it's plain hot dog for you.
[53:46.830 --> 53:47.610]  Is that, is that the...
[53:48.430 --> 53:50.730]  In the event of no condiment at all or plain hot dog.
[53:50.730 --> 53:53.630]  If you're going to get a hot dog and the only thing they have is ketchup,
[53:53.770 --> 53:55.530]  that means you're just going to have that plain dog.
[53:55.990 --> 53:56.670]  Yeah. Okay.
[53:57.470 --> 53:59.470]  I'll take a dry dog over a ketchup dog.
[53:59.770 --> 54:01.710]  Would you allow some solo mustard though?
[54:02.070 --> 54:03.250]  Yeah, that's totally acceptable.
[54:03.990 --> 54:06.070]  Mustard is a very complimentary flavor to the hot dog.
[54:06.630 --> 54:08.010]  How do you feel about ketchup generally?
[54:08.650 --> 54:10.090]  I love it. It's good on fries.
[54:10.390 --> 54:14.010]  It works well, you know, with a burger, ketchup, mustard, good stuff.
[54:15.170 --> 54:18.670]  But on its own, on a dog, just a weird flavor profile.
[54:18.970 --> 54:20.590]  Don't like it. Shouldn't allow it.
[54:21.190 --> 54:23.950]  Wow. I've never... wow.
[54:24.770 --> 54:27.910]  And you think it's so bad that people shouldn't be allowed to do it?
[54:28.230 --> 54:30.230]  Just generally? Should just be outlawed?
[54:30.370 --> 54:31.590]  Should be a banned combination?
[54:32.170 --> 54:34.850]  Well, I hadn't thought of it that way until you mentioned it, but yeah.
[54:35.850 --> 54:36.390]  Fuck em.
[54:38.550 --> 54:44.890]  Oh, I'm a ketchup only dog guy, so I'm going to have to completely change.
[54:45.050 --> 54:46.970]  Yeah, absolutely. I am.
[54:47.190 --> 54:47.950]  So sorry to hear that.
[54:48.050 --> 54:50.410]  Mustard guy. Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to change how I do it.
[54:50.730 --> 54:52.150]  I think it's so inoffensive.
[54:52.350 --> 54:55.750]  And I think the benefits of ketchup compared with a plain dog,
[54:56.790 --> 54:58.290]  it's like absolutely astronomical.
[54:58.510 --> 55:00.310]  I would always go for the ketchup over nothing.
[55:00.710 --> 55:02.270]  And I'm not even a big ketchup guy.
[55:02.870 --> 55:03.350]  Hey, Nick.
[55:03.770 --> 55:04.270]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:04.330 --> 55:06.170]  I'm going to go with you. Why not?
[55:07.750 --> 55:09.070]  Sure, you don't believe that.
[55:09.390 --> 55:11.250]  No, absolutely. No, I don't. But I got it.
[55:11.290 --> 55:12.510]  Somebody's got to be on the side here.
[55:12.750 --> 55:14.030]  No, they don't.
[55:14.510 --> 55:16.370]  I don't want non-believers on my team.
[55:16.530 --> 55:18.170]  Yeah, I don't want non-believers.
[55:18.170 --> 55:19.810]  He doesn't want your charity support.
[55:20.630 --> 55:22.210]  Someone's got to help this guy.
[55:22.390 --> 55:23.710]  He's hanging by a thread here.
[55:24.130 --> 55:27.610]  He's telling people they're not allowed to have ketchup.
[55:27.610 --> 55:29.550]  Look, Archie will learn both things.
[55:30.170 --> 55:31.550]  No ketchup on dog alone.
[55:31.730 --> 55:33.650]  Oh, is this something that he does right now?
[55:34.070 --> 55:36.270]  No, he doesn't fucking eat condiments.
[55:38.070 --> 55:40.230]  What are you about to say?
[55:40.710 --> 55:42.770]  That little non-sauce monkey.
[55:45.330 --> 55:47.470]  He is the opposite of that character.
[55:47.470 --> 55:49.970]  Sauce guy banning sauces.
[55:49.990 --> 55:50.810]  That's crazy.
[55:50.910 --> 55:53.990]  But I think that it's in lieu of it's not just banning the sauce.
[55:54.110 --> 55:55.990]  It's in lieu of like, you need more sauces.
[55:56.130 --> 55:57.630]  I can't just be the single sauce.
[55:57.770 --> 56:02.370]  I think a hot dog might be the most in need of condiment food that exists.
[56:02.930 --> 56:03.890]  Yeah, I don't disagree.
[56:04.250 --> 56:05.450]  Like I would have a dry...
[56:05.450 --> 56:08.410]  So he's telling you put a bunch of condiments on that sucker.
[56:08.690 --> 56:09.710]  Yeah, together.
[56:10.270 --> 56:13.190]  There's a certain point where when I'm putting condiments on a dog,
[56:13.250 --> 56:15.850]  I feel like the effort is more than what it's worth.
[56:15.850 --> 56:19.670]  I don't want to have to open three different bottles for my hot dog.
[56:19.690 --> 56:20.350]  I hear that.
[56:20.750 --> 56:21.270]  It's too much.
[56:21.490 --> 56:26.830]  If you had one bottle with three nozzles and it was just a singular squeeze for all the condiments.
[56:27.610 --> 56:29.210]  Somebody get uniform on the phone.
[56:31.790 --> 56:34.010]  The relish hole would have to be quite big.
[56:34.730 --> 56:37.190]  Didn't they do that with like a peanut butter and jelly back in the day?
[56:37.910 --> 56:39.750]  I mean, you can get little jars of the same shit.
[56:40.170 --> 56:40.530]  Yes.
[56:40.910 --> 56:43.330]  Like all that goober gross looking goob shit.
[56:43.450 --> 56:44.510]  That is what it was called.
[56:44.570 --> 56:45.290]  It was called goober.
[56:45.290 --> 56:46.610]  It was like striped.
[56:46.830 --> 56:46.990]  Yeah.
[56:47.390 --> 56:47.770]  Disgusting.
[56:47.930 --> 56:51.090]  Yeah, I saw that in stores the first time I came to America.
[56:52.150 --> 56:53.690]  What the hell is wrong with this place?
[56:53.690 --> 56:54.190]  What have they done?
[56:54.690 --> 56:57.730]  Is it illegal to have it in England or is it just sort of frowned upon?
[56:57.810 --> 56:59.430]  So you have to put it in your ass to get it there.
[57:02.650 --> 57:03.410]  British customs.
[57:05.230 --> 57:07.450]  Looking for goober and mines in my ass.
[57:07.550 --> 57:08.690]  They can't do anything about it.
[57:09.730 --> 57:11.270]  We know he has goober.
[57:11.610 --> 57:14.570]  And we know his Charlie ratings are off the chart on this.
[57:15.290 --> 57:16.690]  This goddamn goober.
[57:17.790 --> 57:22.010]  Doing a 10 hour flight with an ass load of goober would be an absolute nightmare.
[57:22.870 --> 57:24.470]  You hear the jar crack.
[57:24.850 --> 57:25.430]  Oh, no.
[57:26.490 --> 57:27.370]  Oh, man.
[57:27.470 --> 57:28.490]  Oh, that'd be terrible.
[57:29.090 --> 57:29.810]  Oh, man.
[57:29.990 --> 57:31.690]  What a bunch of interesting takes.
[57:31.910 --> 57:33.790]  Really, really, really interesting takes.
[57:33.950 --> 57:37.870]  I mean, this show was created so that way Taylor Kitsch could have something to do,
[57:37.990 --> 57:40.690]  but it really took us down some rabbit holes.
[57:41.830 --> 57:43.410]  Very, very interesting.
[57:43.410 --> 57:48.550]  Uh, I'm so excited to see how the audience feels about these takes.
[57:48.710 --> 57:51.750]  I'm interested in audience opinion on the poll.
[57:51.870 --> 57:53.510]  I'm interested in the audience takes.
[57:53.550 --> 57:57.570]  I'm interested if they want us to do another round of takes, Jeff's takes included.
[57:57.810 --> 57:59.810]  Oh, I'm sure Jeff would have great takes.
[58:00.130 --> 58:03.810]  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely it's not going to be inverted versus verted,
[58:03.930 --> 58:04.750]  but it will be something.
[58:04.850 --> 58:05.570]  So I'm very curious.
[58:05.670 --> 58:05.970]  You don't know that.
[58:06.450 --> 58:08.870]  Maybe he's a maybe he's a secret inverter.
[58:09.790 --> 58:10.850]  You know, a secret inverter?
[58:11.470 --> 58:11.930]  He's not.
[58:11.930 --> 58:13.190]  You know, it's crazy.
[58:13.610 --> 58:19.010]  I feel like my first take was so wild and useless,
[58:19.090 --> 58:22.690]  yet somehow I still agree with it more than both of Nick's picks.
[58:26.030 --> 58:27.450]  Well, incredible.
[58:27.710 --> 58:29.370]  What's it like to be wrong?
[58:29.770 --> 58:29.930]  I'm wrong.
[58:29.950 --> 58:30.390]  We'll see.
[58:30.790 --> 58:31.890]  Maybe he's right.
[58:32.030 --> 58:33.070]  Maybe the audience will.
[58:33.450 --> 58:35.470]  No confidence in asking Gavin a question.
[58:35.630 --> 58:36.870]  What is it?
[58:36.990 --> 58:37.990]  How does it feel?
[58:38.850 --> 58:39.650]  I don't know, just, you know.
[58:40.130 --> 58:41.230]  Anyway, vote in the poll.
[58:41.230 --> 58:42.090]  Was that the end of the sentence?
[58:42.370 --> 58:43.050]  Oh, my God.
[58:43.470 --> 58:44.570]  Vote in the poll.

[58:49.890 --> 58:50.930]  I can't wait to see what happens.
[58:51.390 --> 58:54.410]  So they're voting for they're voting for the worst take.
[58:54.490 --> 58:55.130]  Is that what it is?
[58:55.190 --> 58:58.150]  They're voting for the worst take to see who will have to
[58:58.150 --> 59:01.090]  hang the idiot flag on themselves.
[59:01.530 --> 59:02.330]  Pretty exciting.
[59:02.590 --> 59:03.350]  Well, that's good stuff.
[59:03.470 --> 59:03.610]  I can't wait to get home.
[59:03.970 --> 59:04.470]  Pretty cool.
