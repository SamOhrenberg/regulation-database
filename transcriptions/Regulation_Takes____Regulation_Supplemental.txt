[00:00.000 --> 00:01.720]  Hey, it's Paris.
[00:02.100 --> 00:04.240]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[00:04.440 --> 00:06.000]  Like stars. Duh.
[00:06.500 --> 00:08.240]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp,
[00:08.400 --> 00:10.120]  I just slept under them.
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.400]  Picture me, serving looks
[00:12.400 --> 00:14.300]  by the fire outside my luxurious
[00:14.300 --> 00:16.240]  Airstream, making s'mores
[00:16.240 --> 00:18.480]  with the kids, while a national
[00:18.480 --> 00:19.740]  park is our backdrop.
[00:20.480 --> 00:22.160]  The great outdoors meets Hilton
[00:22.160 --> 00:24.020]  hospitality. That's hot.
[00:24.620 --> 00:26.280]  Explore all the new ways to stay
[00:26.280 --> 00:27.720]  at Hilton.com.
[00:27.720 --> 00:29.420]  Hilton for the stay.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.060]  Hello and welcome to our
[00:32.060 --> 00:34.020]  newest supplemental concept
[00:34.020 --> 00:35.840]  idea, Regulation Takes.
[00:36.140 --> 00:37.680]  I am hosting this.
[00:38.080 --> 00:38.900]  I can't believe it.
[00:39.460 --> 00:41.680]  I am joined alongside Eric,
[00:42.120 --> 00:43.280]  Gavin, and Nick.
[00:43.720 --> 00:45.880]  I'm excited to hear some takes. Let me explain
[00:45.880 --> 00:47.880]  the takes format before we get going.
[00:48.220 --> 00:49.700]  We have all prepared takes,
[00:50.060 --> 00:52.040]  which are stances in which we feel
[00:52.040 --> 00:53.140]  passionate about.
[00:53.480 --> 00:55.900]  We will share our takes
[00:55.900 --> 00:57.880]  one at a time. I'm not sure how many we'll
[00:57.880 --> 00:59.960]  do this first time we're doing it. Who knows
[00:59.960 --> 01:02.000]  how long this is going to be? We'll have to
[01:02.000 --> 01:03.800]  figure that out. You'll see. I guess you'll know
[01:03.800 --> 01:06.000]  going into it. You'll see the timer. But we don't know.
[01:06.560 --> 01:07.740]  So we'll all say our takes.
[01:08.080 --> 01:09.940]  Then after this comes out, I will
[01:09.940 --> 01:11.420]  put out a poll on our Patreon,
[01:11.880 --> 01:13.320]  which is The Regulation Pod,
[01:13.900 --> 01:15.800]  and you can vote on who had the worst take
[01:15.800 --> 01:18.060]  and whoever has the worst take or takes
[01:18.560 --> 01:19.560]  gets the idiot flag.
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.860]  Till the next episode. Dean the idiot.
[01:22.280 --> 01:23.060]  But it's not a draft.
[01:23.060 --> 01:25.100]  It's not a draft. No.
[01:25.460 --> 01:26.720]  I'll be honest. I was
[01:26.720 --> 01:29.060]  like 80% sure you were somehow
[01:29.060 --> 01:30.700]  going to call a blindside and we'd be doing
[01:31.980 --> 01:33.020]  ratting because
[01:33.020 --> 01:34.920]  this sounds like a fake idea.
[01:35.600 --> 01:37.020]  Oh, this is so
[01:37.020 --> 01:39.100]  far from a fake idea. This is like
[01:39.100 --> 01:41.180]  the most popular idea in any
[01:41.180 --> 01:42.360]  show format ever.
[01:42.740 --> 01:44.660]  Yeah, this is a...
[01:44.660 --> 01:47.160]  I could tell it was a real Andrew idea because this is
[01:47.160 --> 01:49.160]  the closest we're going to get to sports
[01:50.240 --> 01:50.760]  media.
[01:50.760 --> 01:52.260]  You know what I mean?
[01:52.380 --> 01:54.700]  This is so close. Hot take,
[01:54.800 --> 01:56.940]  first take, like that kind of thing
[01:56.940 --> 01:58.660]  that it read
[01:58.660 --> 02:00.200]  as true to me all the way.
[02:00.820 --> 02:02.340]  Well, until we do a March Madness bracket.
[02:02.980 --> 02:03.500]  That's true.
[02:04.340 --> 02:06.540]  But this is, again, not a draft.
[02:06.820 --> 02:08.680]  The first thing Gavin asked when he got here
[02:08.680 --> 02:10.060]  today, is this a draft?
[02:10.560 --> 02:12.800]  We reassured him, no, it's not.
[02:13.200 --> 02:14.060]  The pool is takes.
[02:14.820 --> 02:16.060]  Yeah, the pool is takes.
[02:16.440 --> 02:18.500]  But also, there's no real pool
[02:18.500 --> 02:19.460]  because it's not a draft.
[02:20.840 --> 02:22.520]  So, Andrew, how many
[02:22.520 --> 02:24.560]  takes are... I mean, we'll go one at a time,
[02:24.580 --> 02:26.500]  but how many takes are we going
[02:26.500 --> 02:27.660]  to be giving each?
[02:28.160 --> 02:30.540]  I don't know how long it'll take for us to go
[02:30.540 --> 02:32.480]  through everybody's takes. It'll be interesting to see.
[02:32.720 --> 02:34.380]  So, maybe we'll do one each, maybe
[02:34.380 --> 02:36.400]  we'll do two each. We will state
[02:36.400 --> 02:37.820]  our take and then
[02:38.440 --> 02:40.500]  you can sort of defend or maybe people
[02:40.500 --> 02:42.440]  just agree. And that's the
[02:42.440 --> 02:43.440]  support of the take.
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.480]  This is a thing I largely wanted to do
[02:46.480 --> 02:48.420]  because I have a take that I think about
[02:48.420 --> 02:50.680]  all the time that I don't know how else
[02:50.680 --> 02:52.540]  to put it. Like, this can't
[02:52.540 --> 02:54.560]  be a draft. This isn't really a
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.560]  podcast subject.
[02:56.100 --> 02:57.740]  So I had to create a show
[02:59.460 --> 03:00.660]  around being able
[03:00.660 --> 03:01.740]  to discuss this take.
[03:02.080 --> 03:04.340]  I have an opinion. I need a show for that.
[03:04.340 --> 03:06.640]  I have an opinion. We need a vehicle
[03:06.640 --> 03:07.880]  to discuss this opinion.
[03:08.400 --> 03:10.120]  It's an opinion I have not heard often.
[03:10.200 --> 03:12.240]  But how do we determine the order
[03:12.240 --> 03:13.840]  of delivering these takes?
[03:13.840 --> 03:16.300]  Well, you should go first because you built a show around your take.
[03:16.420 --> 03:17.880]  Yeah, I absolutely think you should go
[03:17.880 --> 03:19.540]  first. I think we could also go
[03:19.540 --> 03:21.820]  in Discord order, which is
[03:21.820 --> 03:23.880]  just our names in order here, which appears
[03:23.880 --> 03:25.900]  to be alphabetical. So, maybe
[03:25.900 --> 03:26.800]  we just go that way.
[03:27.740 --> 03:29.700]  We'll see how it goes. Now, you mentioned a timer.
[03:30.120 --> 03:30.860]  Is there a timer?
[03:31.840 --> 03:33.820]  Not a timer for the take, but I just know
[03:33.820 --> 03:35.740]  maybe somebody's take will
[03:35.740 --> 03:37.720]  take four minutes to do. Maybe somebody's will take
[03:37.720 --> 03:40.020]  two. I just wanted to make sure
[03:40.020 --> 03:40.960]  I didn't have to run a timer.
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.900]  No, no, no. You don't have to. This isn't like
[03:42.900 --> 03:44.920]  a strict debate format or anything.
[03:45.040 --> 03:47.000]  I don't know. Gavin didn't even know if this was
[03:47.000 --> 03:47.580]  a draft or not.
[03:48.740 --> 03:49.640]  That's very fair.
[03:51.260 --> 03:51.980]  Gavin Rebuttal?
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.860]  Andrew, why don't you lead us off with
[03:56.860 --> 03:58.840]  your first take? My first take
[03:59.800 --> 04:01.060]  is something I think about
[04:01.060 --> 04:02.980]  all the time. It's a weird thing to think about
[04:02.980 --> 04:04.200]  all the time. I'll acknowledge that.
[04:04.620 --> 04:07.060]  But it is something I think about quite frequently.
[04:07.780 --> 04:08.920]  My first take
[04:08.920 --> 04:11.140]  is that Taylor Kitsch deserves
[04:11.140 --> 04:13.200]  better. Taylor Kitsch
[04:13.200 --> 04:15.260]  has one of the worst
[04:15.260 --> 04:17.300]  acting careers in modern
[04:17.300 --> 04:19.460]  times, and I don't think it's his fault
[04:19.460 --> 04:20.940]  at all. I think he's pretty good.
[04:21.440 --> 04:23.180]  I think he's a solid actor.
[04:23.780 --> 04:25.420]  He was on Friday Night Lights,
[04:25.800 --> 04:27.000]  which is incredibly popular,
[04:27.660 --> 04:28.920]  and he has a
[04:28.920 --> 04:30.920]  run of things that just
[04:30.920 --> 04:33.020]  were terrible, but not terrible
[04:33.020 --> 04:34.500]  because it was his fault.
[04:34.880 --> 04:36.840]  My first example of this
[04:36.840 --> 04:38.560]  is he got to be Gambit
[04:38.560 --> 04:40.680]  in X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[04:40.820 --> 04:42.640]  He was Gambit. He was fine
[04:42.640 --> 04:45.120]  as Gambit,
[04:45.120 --> 04:46.540]  but that movie was terrible,
[04:46.540 --> 04:48.640]  and nothing expanded
[04:48.640 --> 04:50.640]  beyond that. It was a weird thing to
[04:50.640 --> 04:52.600]  read about the history of it, where they
[04:52.600 --> 04:54.680]  always wanted Channing Tatum, but he
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.700]  was always busy, and so
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.620]  they booked him because he wasn't available.
[04:59.140 --> 05:00.780]  But they gave him a three-movie deal, which
[05:00.780 --> 05:02.660]  did not happen. There was only
[05:02.660 --> 05:04.540]  a singular cameo because nobody
[05:04.540 --> 05:06.280]  liked X-Men Origins Wolverine.
[05:06.620 --> 05:08.620]  A beloved character in a
[05:08.620 --> 05:10.580]  beloved series of films, I think this
[05:10.580 --> 05:12.520]  is the most hated one by far.
[05:12.940 --> 05:14.020]  He just happened to be
[05:14.300 --> 05:16.560]  in the worst Wolverine that they
[05:16.560 --> 05:18.500]  could possibly make. You created
[05:18.500 --> 05:20.480]  an entire show for
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.140]  that take?
[05:21.880 --> 05:22.900]  I'm not done.
[05:23.480 --> 05:25.280]  Let me establish more.
[05:25.920 --> 05:28.600]  To be fair, it will still be the
[05:28.600 --> 05:30.580]  same take as he continues to argue
[05:30.580 --> 05:32.700]  this, so the answer to your question is yes.
[05:32.700 --> 05:34.240]  Justifying the take.
[05:34.700 --> 05:36.620]  Right, and so the answer to your question
[05:36.620 --> 05:38.660]  is yes, Gavin. We often
[05:38.660 --> 05:40.960]  talk about 1994,
[05:41.580 --> 05:42.500]  Amazing Jim Carrey,
[05:42.580 --> 05:44.580]  one of the best years of the film,
[05:45.040 --> 05:46.800]  Renny Ackerman, three absolute
[05:46.800 --> 05:48.720]  bangers. Taylor Kitsch had
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.780]  maybe the worst version of
[05:50.780 --> 05:52.820]  that, where he had a
[05:53.560 --> 05:54.240]  2012
[05:54.240 --> 05:57.020]  that was John Carter
[05:57.020 --> 05:59.120]  from Mars, Battleship,
[05:59.520 --> 06:00.260]  and Savages.
[06:00.260 --> 06:02.200]  All three of those, not
[06:02.200 --> 06:04.160]  his fault. John Carter was
[06:04.160 --> 06:06.260]  terrible. It was just like a soulless CG.
[06:06.420 --> 06:08.280]  It just was weird. There was no heart to it.
[06:08.680 --> 06:10.200]  Nobody came out of John Carter looking
[06:10.200 --> 06:12.040]  good. Battleship,
[06:12.780 --> 06:13.700]  absolute disaster.
[06:14.100 --> 06:16.120]  Just a terrible film. Not
[06:16.120 --> 06:17.960]  his fault. Savages,
[06:18.760 --> 06:20.100]  an Oliver Stone movie
[06:20.100 --> 06:22.120]  that had like all the pieces to be good, like
[06:22.120 --> 06:24.260]  you'd understand from the outside wanting to be in an
[06:24.260 --> 06:25.400]  Oliver Stone movie as a lead.
[06:25.820 --> 06:28.000]  All the acting in that movie is great.
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.060]  All around, just a really dumb
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.160]  bad story.
[06:32.700 --> 06:33.980]  Savages has like
[06:33.980 --> 06:36.000]  Benicio Del Toro and Aaron
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.420]  Taylor Johnson and stuff.
[06:37.820 --> 06:39.340]  It has a bunch of people.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.800]  It is a weird thing where
[06:41.800 --> 06:43.980]  I would argue he was the only one
[06:43.980 --> 06:45.940]  impacted by the failure of Savages.
[06:46.120 --> 06:47.460]  100% absolutely agree.
[06:47.740 --> 06:50.080]  John Carter was like this also $300
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.740]  million Disney movie
[06:51.740 --> 06:53.440]  that was terrible.
[06:53.980 --> 06:56.100]  Nobody saw it. It was a huge flop.
[06:56.100 --> 06:57.880]  It was a summer flop
[06:57.880 --> 07:00.180]  for Taylor Kitsch, and I feel like
[07:00.180 --> 07:01.960]  that completely
[07:01.960 --> 07:04.120]  broke the wings off of what his
[07:04.120 --> 07:05.680]  career trajectory could be.
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.620]  But he had to fade
[07:07.620 --> 07:09.640]  into the distance, and so he went
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.280]  quiet for a little bit.
[07:11.580 --> 07:13.420]  Off the grid. He went dark.
[07:13.540 --> 07:15.920]  He then came back. I mean, he had
[07:15.920 --> 07:17.980]  Lone Survivor, which was like, it was fine.
[07:18.560 --> 07:20.060]  But then he got booked
[07:20.060 --> 07:22.020]  on True Detective Season 2.
[07:22.320 --> 07:24.120]  True Detective, the biggest
[07:24.120 --> 07:25.520]  show of that year.
[07:25.900 --> 07:28.260]  Everyone's loving it. It's a critical darling.
[07:28.540 --> 07:29.640]  They're running it back
[07:29.640 --> 07:31.100]  for Season 2.
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.840]  Everyone's so excited, and then
[07:33.840 --> 07:35.420]  everybody hated Season 2.
[07:35.940 --> 07:37.500]  It is the
[07:38.060 --> 07:39.420]  worst reviewed season
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.140]  of True Detective
[07:41.140 --> 07:43.300]  with a 61%.
[07:44.000 --> 07:45.960]  Once again, he was totally
[07:45.960 --> 07:47.580]  fine in it. He was good,
[07:47.840 --> 07:50.060]  I would say. Good performance by Taylor Kitsch.
[07:50.440 --> 07:52.100]  Just everything he touches
[07:52.100 --> 07:54.140]  is the worst version
[07:54.140 --> 07:56.040]  of that thing, but it is
[07:56.040 --> 07:57.300]  in no way his fault.
[07:57.680 --> 08:00.300]  He should be in most of the action roles
[08:00.300 --> 08:02.060]  that John Krasinski has had
[08:02.060 --> 08:03.420]  in the last five years.
[08:03.760 --> 08:06.180]  He would be so much better in all
[08:06.180 --> 08:08.040]  these sort of... I'm not saying that he's an
[08:08.040 --> 08:09.840]  Oscar-winning actor and that
[08:09.840 --> 08:12.120]  he should have been in these
[08:12.120 --> 08:13.760]  epic dramas, but
[08:13.760 --> 08:16.480]  any kind of generic John Krasinski
[08:16.480 --> 08:18.140]  action movie, I think he would
[08:18.140 --> 08:19.900]  have been significantly better at.
[08:19.900 --> 08:21.980]  Oh, I think that he's...
[08:21.980 --> 08:23.800]  The reason his career is what it is is
[08:23.800 --> 08:25.020]  because of Aaron Taylor Johnson.
[08:25.420 --> 08:27.440]  That role is filled by
[08:27.440 --> 08:29.800]  Aaron Taylor Johnson. If Aaron Taylor
[08:29.800 --> 08:30.940]  Johnson did not exist,
[08:31.540 --> 08:33.740]  this guy's working. This guy's working
[08:33.740 --> 08:35.000]  everything without him.
[08:35.400 --> 08:37.460]  It has been an interesting... He's had to
[08:37.460 --> 08:40.040]  go on Netflix-type series
[08:40.040 --> 08:41.560]  and he's building things back up,
[08:41.820 --> 08:43.760]  but I just think it's such a weird
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.620]  career where everything
[08:45.620 --> 08:47.460]  that he did, I understand,
[08:47.460 --> 08:49.240]  accepting and being like, yeah, I'm going to be in a
[08:49.240 --> 08:51.700]  Wolverine movie, I'm going to be in this,
[08:51.800 --> 08:53.500]  I'm going to be the lead of a
[08:53.500 --> 08:55.380]  Disney epic for $400 million,
[08:55.500 --> 08:57.000]  a huge box office movie,
[08:57.180 --> 08:59.380]  but none of it worked, and none of it was
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.260]  his fault. I just think that's incredibly
[09:01.260 --> 09:03.240]  fascinating. He's like the king of good
[09:03.240 --> 09:05.820]  franchise stick-out stinkers.
[09:06.200 --> 09:07.180]  He's always in the
[09:07.180 --> 09:09.400]  most dogshit version of the
[09:09.400 --> 09:10.820]  actual product. Absolutely.
[09:12.120 --> 09:13.380]  I just think
[09:13.380 --> 09:15.240]  it's such a fascinating career trajectory.
[09:15.240 --> 09:17.380]  If you gave me an infinite amount
[09:17.380 --> 09:18.460]  of time and
[09:19.420 --> 09:21.200]  500 million different guesses
[09:21.200 --> 09:23.000]  on what your take was going to be, I
[09:23.000 --> 09:24.580]  still wouldn't have come up with it.
[09:24.660 --> 09:27.440]  No, absolutely. He created a show,
[09:27.840 --> 09:29.200]  Gavin. He created a show
[09:29.200 --> 09:30.700]  so he can explain this to us.
[09:31.320 --> 09:33.280]  I think everyone is going to have fun takes,
[09:33.280 --> 09:35.160]  it's just I think about Taylor Kitsch's
[09:35.160 --> 09:36.140]  career a lot.
[09:37.100 --> 09:39.260]  A guy I've never heard of in a bunch
[09:39.260 --> 09:41.260]  of movies and shows I've never seen
[09:42.620 --> 09:43.580]  deserves better.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.500]  You telling me you're not a big
[09:45.500 --> 09:46.780]  Friday Night Lights head?
[09:47.360 --> 09:49.360]  Never seen it. You weren't into the
[09:50.340 --> 09:51.680]  Texas high school
[09:51.680 --> 09:52.860]  football teen drama?
[09:53.480 --> 09:55.440]  I guess not. Crazy. I guess it never spoke to me.
[09:56.100 --> 09:57.480]  It was great. I'd highly
[09:57.480 --> 09:59.540]  recommend the show. There's an actor in the show
[09:59.540 --> 10:01.180]  that feels like he's not an actor
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.120]  and they just made a show around him
[10:03.960 --> 10:05.060]  and he's wonderful.
[10:05.420 --> 10:07.640]  Highly recommend it, just for his performance alone.
[10:08.200 --> 10:09.420]  Not Taylor Kitsch, but
[10:09.420 --> 10:11.640]  he runs a car dealership and he's great.
[10:13.200 --> 10:13.840]  Taylor Kitsch
[10:13.840 --> 10:14.680]  also very good in the show.
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.260]  But that is my take. Taylor Kitsch
[10:17.260 --> 10:19.280]  deserves so much better than he got
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.720]  and I'm happy to see that he's getting a little bit
[10:21.720 --> 10:23.700]  of a resurgence. I think Taylor Kitsch
[10:23.700 --> 10:25.540]  is exactly where he probably needs to be.
[10:25.760 --> 10:27.540]  I don't think that there's...
[10:27.540 --> 10:29.460]  I'm not clamoring for
[10:29.460 --> 10:31.680]  dude, the other guy from The Savages
[10:31.680 --> 10:33.300]  to be in...
[10:33.300 --> 10:35.660]  Because you didn't get to see him in those
[10:35.660 --> 10:37.680]  roles. That's what I'd argue.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.360]  I think he could be
[10:39.360 --> 10:41.460]  a dynamic, fun action star
[10:41.460 --> 10:43.260]  and we just never got that.
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.940]  I think that if
[10:44.940 --> 10:47.360]  TV was still around, this
[10:47.360 --> 10:49.360]  guy would be Spike
[10:49.360 --> 10:51.220]  TV hero
[10:51.220 --> 10:53.440]  of whatever show is on Spike TV.
[10:53.600 --> 10:55.280]  Like, this is a
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.200]  cable actor.
[10:57.980 --> 10:59.340]  That is what this guy reads
[10:59.340 --> 11:00.740]  to me. I mean, that's fair.
[11:01.100 --> 11:03.160]  That's certainly where he's found his most success.
[11:03.700 --> 11:04.920]  Yeah, but...
[11:04.920 --> 11:06.860]  He was Gambit.
[11:07.720 --> 11:08.880]  He was Gambit
[11:08.880 --> 11:09.900]  for four minutes.
[11:10.200 --> 11:11.340]  He was Gambit.
[11:12.640 --> 11:14.180]  Four minutes of Gambit.
[11:14.520 --> 11:16.040]  I guess I have seen him as Gambit.
[11:16.600 --> 11:17.820]  And that's about it.
[11:18.460 --> 11:20.700]  I feel like he's the only person from
[11:20.700 --> 11:22.760]  this Deadpool, Wolverine era that
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.680]  we're in where they're bringing everybody back.
[11:24.760 --> 11:25.920]  He's never going to get brought back.
[11:26.580 --> 11:28.820]  Did they bring back the guy who was the blob?
[11:29.200 --> 11:29.540]  No.
[11:30.260 --> 11:32.960]  What about Will.i.am? Will.i.am wasn't in anything else.
[11:33.380 --> 11:34.460]  No, that's fair.
[11:34.460 --> 11:36.480]  Should your take be that Will.i.am
[11:36.480 --> 11:37.700]  should be in more X-Men movies?
[11:38.100 --> 11:40.600]  No. I didn't think he was that good.
[11:41.180 --> 11:42.240]  Oh, but
[11:42.240 --> 11:43.860]  Taylor Kitsch was?
[11:44.240 --> 11:46.060]  Yeah, he was fine. He was solid.
[11:46.860 --> 11:48.840]  I think you should edit Taylor Kitsch's
[11:48.840 --> 11:49.760]  next reel.
[11:50.100 --> 11:52.400]  I think you should reach out
[11:52.400 --> 11:54.440]  and see if Taylor Kitsch has
[11:54.440 --> 11:56.380]  any hot takes he wants to give, because I bet
[11:56.380 --> 11:57.240]  you could get him.
[11:58.520 --> 11:59.680]  We'll see what I can do.
[12:00.280 --> 12:02.580]  Maybe you can help him get on an Australian morning show.
[12:02.580 --> 12:02.820]  Yeah.
[12:04.920 --> 12:06.240]  He's nice. He's promoting
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.000]  our podcast.
[12:08.440 --> 12:10.680]  I think if it was based
[12:10.680 --> 12:12.540]  on how it worked with Gavin, he'd be promoting
[12:12.540 --> 12:14.000]  Friday Night Lights the show.
[12:19.360 --> 12:19.980]  How did
[12:19.980 --> 12:20.560]  it all start?
[12:21.460 --> 12:22.380]  How'd you get into acting?
[12:24.040 --> 12:25.000]  Oh, man.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.620]  Well, that's my take. Eric,
[12:27.960 --> 12:29.940]  what is your take if we're going in
[12:29.940 --> 12:31.880]  Discord order? Your take was
[12:31.880 --> 12:34.000]  so interesting. I don't find mine to be as
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.980]  interesting. Yeah, I feel kind of dumb.
[12:36.160 --> 12:38.020]  Yeah. No, I definitely don't feel
[12:38.020 --> 12:39.460]  dumb. I definitely feel like,
[12:39.620 --> 12:41.540]  I don't know. We'll see how my takes
[12:41.540 --> 12:43.540]  weather. Yeah, I'm not sure I did this right.
[12:44.200 --> 12:46.080]  No. I'm so excited to get to Gavin's.
[12:46.260 --> 12:48.200]  My take
[12:48.740 --> 12:49.620]  is that
[12:49.620 --> 12:51.880]  the take of there are
[12:51.880 --> 12:54.000]  too many podcasts is
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.920]  a hack take from
[12:55.920 --> 12:58.060]  people who would kill
[12:58.060 --> 12:59.440]  to have a podcast.
[12:59.880 --> 13:01.960]  You hear it all
[13:01.960 --> 13:03.840]  the time. There are too many podcasts.
[13:03.980 --> 13:06.040]  We should put tariffs on podcast
[13:06.040 --> 13:06.540]  equipment.
[13:07.220 --> 13:08.080]  It's a
[13:09.740 --> 13:11.980]  hack take from hack people
[13:11.980 --> 13:13.600]  who, it's
[13:13.600 --> 13:15.680]  the low hanging fruit. It's the easy
[13:15.680 --> 13:17.660]  punching bag. Do I love how many
[13:17.660 --> 13:19.580]  podcasts there are? No. But
[13:19.580 --> 13:21.780]  the more podcasts that
[13:21.780 --> 13:23.760]  come out, the more listening hours
[13:23.760 --> 13:25.960]  are consumed monthly.
[13:26.420 --> 13:27.360]  Month on month
[13:27.360 --> 13:29.500]  since podcasts have
[13:29.500 --> 13:31.580]  become a large source
[13:31.580 --> 13:33.480]  of entertainment. I don't
[13:33.480 --> 13:35.400]  think there are too many
[13:35.400 --> 13:37.460]  podcasts. I don't think
[13:37.460 --> 13:39.120]  it should discourage anyone
[13:39.120 --> 13:40.840]  from starting a podcast.
[13:41.140 --> 13:43.740]  I think anyone with
[13:43.740 --> 13:45.480]  some ideas and
[13:45.480 --> 13:47.500]  everything can do this. I think
[13:47.500 --> 13:49.540]  that it's a lot easier to have the take
[13:49.540 --> 13:51.380]  online of there are too many podcasts than
[13:51.380 --> 13:53.440]  there are to try it yourself and see if
[13:53.440 --> 13:55.440]  you're successful. That's where that take
[13:55.440 --> 13:57.460]  comes from. And if you were to give
[13:57.460 --> 13:59.620]  those people microphones, they couldn't
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.340]  fucking wait to make three episodes
[14:01.340 --> 14:03.100]  and abandon it. That is
[14:03.100 --> 14:05.440]  the true way of
[14:05.440 --> 14:06.620]  podcasts is that.
[14:07.360 --> 14:09.500]  I think just because they are so popular
[14:09.500 --> 14:11.480]  and trending in such a
[14:11.480 --> 14:13.260]  big way, it's just an easy
[14:13.260 --> 14:15.000]  thing to say, but nobody
[14:15.740 --> 14:17.440]  really truly believes
[14:17.440 --> 14:19.060]  it by and large.
[14:19.580 --> 14:20.980]  That's my take.
[14:21.260 --> 14:23.000]  How many podcasts do you work on?
[14:23.560 --> 14:25.380]  I have right now. Well, Good Morning
[14:25.380 --> 14:26.880]  Gus is actually
[14:26.880 --> 14:29.580]  coming out right now. So there's one
[14:29.580 --> 14:31.360]  100% E and there's this
[14:31.360 --> 14:31.900]  one.
[14:33.260 --> 14:35.100]  We also have Creating Character,
[14:35.340 --> 14:37.380]  which you can check out. I didn't say promote them. I'm just
[14:37.380 --> 14:38.160]  looking for a number here.
[14:38.940 --> 14:41.420]  We can say four. I think four feels good.
[14:41.640 --> 14:43.500]  Yeah. Interesting.
[14:44.260 --> 14:45.480]  I agree with the
[14:45.480 --> 14:46.800]  take only because
[14:46.800 --> 14:49.360]  I think it's a weird situation
[14:49.360 --> 14:51.200]  in which, sure, there are too many
[14:51.200 --> 14:52.920]  podcasts, but who cares?
[14:53.500 --> 14:54.620]  There's also too much
[14:54.620 --> 14:55.980]  TV and too much radio.
[14:57.400 --> 14:58.540]  Everything's on all the time.
[14:58.900 --> 15:00.820]  Yes. I think that there's
[15:00.820 --> 15:02.840]  too many podcasts thing is just an easy thing
[15:02.840 --> 15:04.740]  to tweet out and be
[15:04.740 --> 15:06.860]  like, that's right. I'm above this.
[15:07.040 --> 15:08.760]  It's like, okay. I will say there are
[15:08.760 --> 15:10.660]  a lot of the same guy making the
[15:10.660 --> 15:12.140]  same podcast. There are.
[15:12.780 --> 15:14.520]  There's also a lot of YouTube channels
[15:14.520 --> 15:16.660]  and I think having the take
[15:16.660 --> 15:18.660]  in 2025 that there's too many YouTube channels
[15:18.660 --> 15:19.980]  is the same thing
[15:20.800 --> 15:22.020]  as there are too many
[15:22.020 --> 15:24.020]  podcasts, but that'll be in the next few
[15:24.020 --> 15:26.160]  years when the next wave of whatever
[15:26.160 --> 15:26.800]  entertainment
[15:27.700 --> 15:29.780]  comes out. I don't think it's
[15:29.780 --> 15:31.420]  necessarily so
[15:31.980 --> 15:33.200]  groundbreaking or
[15:33.940 --> 15:35.720]  really correct that there are
[15:35.720 --> 15:37.880]  too many podcasts. I think
[15:37.880 --> 15:40.020]  that shouldn't discourage anyone from picking up a mic
[15:40.020 --> 15:41.860]  and giving it a try. That
[15:41.860 --> 15:43.940]  doesn't mean you're absolved from consequences of
[15:43.940 --> 15:45.760]  things. It just means that
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.920]  I don't think that there are too many. I think there's
[15:47.920 --> 15:49.460]  a lot more stories to be told out there
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.780]  that people could be doing
[15:51.780 --> 15:54.000]  or saying. I think three guys
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.940]  who just went to a bar
[15:56.340 --> 15:57.940]  and coming home and then they don't have
[15:57.940 --> 15:59.700]  anything to say, but then get on a mic.
[15:59.860 --> 16:01.720]  That's what people think a podcast is,
[16:01.900 --> 16:03.660]  but that's not necessarily
[16:04.060 --> 16:05.820]  what you get from a lot of this stuff.
[16:06.180 --> 16:08.040]  That's my take. There are not actually
[16:08.040 --> 16:09.900]  too many podcasts. I think it's also
[16:09.900 --> 16:11.920]  a thing of what you expect to get out of the
[16:11.920 --> 16:13.220]  podcast that you're making. Yeah.
[16:14.120 --> 16:16.020]  Let's say maybe there's a philosophical
[16:16.020 --> 16:18.020]  thing of like, I'm going to get into podcasting
[16:18.540 --> 16:19.880]  and make a ton of money.
[16:20.300 --> 16:21.680]  That is not
[16:21.680 --> 16:23.840]  an easy or like a realistic
[16:23.840 --> 16:25.180]  thing to expect.
[16:25.920 --> 16:28.000]  There are so many podcasts like
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.860]  just, I mean, that is like
[16:29.860 --> 16:32.100]  from a budgetary or like a marketing
[16:32.100 --> 16:33.580]  standpoint of ads and all that.
[16:33.800 --> 16:36.040]  Sure, but if you're
[16:36.040 --> 16:37.960]  just making a podcast because you want to do it
[16:37.960 --> 16:39.800]  and you think it would be fun, like it
[16:39.800 --> 16:41.660]  seems absurd to be like, no,
[16:42.260 --> 16:44.080]  too many. You can't do it. Not
[16:44.080 --> 16:46.180]  allowed. That's how I feel about it. That's
[16:46.180 --> 16:48.360]  my take. I do respect the person
[16:48.360 --> 16:50.220]  that's making it. Also having
[16:50.220 --> 16:52.180]  that take, though, because I feel that way
[16:52.180 --> 16:54.140]  all of the time of like making a show and then being
[16:54.140 --> 16:56.200]  like, why the fuck am I doing this? I got nothing
[16:56.200 --> 16:58.280]  of interest to say. I don't
[16:58.280 --> 17:00.080]  this. There's more qualified
[17:00.080 --> 17:02.340]  people should be making these things.
[17:02.740 --> 17:04.060]  It is wild that I can just
[17:04.060 --> 17:06.020]  do this, but yeah, but anyone can.
[17:06.160 --> 17:08.100]  And I think that's what's I think that's what's
[17:08.100 --> 17:10.020]  cool about it is that anyone can
[17:10.020 --> 17:12.080]  totally. It is very. It is
[17:12.080 --> 17:13.880]  very like 2009
[17:13.880 --> 17:16.060]  YouTube. Yes, to go
[17:16.060 --> 17:17.640]  out there and do it because
[17:17.640 --> 17:19.920]  without podcast, how would we know about
[17:19.920 --> 17:22.100]  Jack's exotic bird? That's such
[17:22.100 --> 17:23.540]  a good point. The world, you know,
[17:24.020 --> 17:25.700]  you all would just have to
[17:25.700 --> 17:27.860]  hoard that knowledge. Yeah, yeah.
[17:27.880 --> 17:29.900]  We would have to do just like the 20 people at that
[17:29.900 --> 17:31.880]  party would know about Jack's exotic bird and not
[17:32.440 --> 17:34.040]  so, so, so many more.
[17:34.120 --> 17:36.000]  And I need as many people as possible
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.080]  to know about Jack's
[17:38.080 --> 17:39.940]  exotic bird. And that's the
[17:39.940 --> 17:41.760]  magic of podcast. It really
[17:41.760 --> 17:42.040]  is.
[17:43.800 --> 17:45.760]  I'm so excited for when we record our next
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.760]  episode. I watched a movie and it opened up a
[17:47.760 --> 17:49.940]  whole new thing of Lord for me that I'm very excited
[17:49.940 --> 17:51.880]  to share. It's fun. It's fun. It's
[17:52.240 --> 17:53.860]  sort of a joy of podcasting
[17:53.860 --> 17:55.620]  is you will do something for yourself
[17:55.620 --> 17:57.480]  and then it will create an opportunity
[17:57.480 --> 17:59.600]  to discuss something in a way you never anticipated.
[17:59.920 --> 18:01.140]  Yeah. Can't wait to share.
[18:01.640 --> 18:03.800]  I'm a kid, so am I going to surprise you with
[18:03.800 --> 18:05.660]  a poster board I need for the science fair
[18:05.660 --> 18:07.700]  tomorrow? Probably. But can you get
[18:07.700 --> 18:09.760]  up to 40% off back to school essentials
[18:09.760 --> 18:11.220]  on Uber Eats? Definitely.
[18:11.820 --> 18:13.660]  So order on Uber Eats and get up
[18:13.660 --> 18:15.660]  to 40% off. Exclusions may apply.
[18:15.760 --> 18:17.700]  Check app for availability. This summer, try
[18:17.700 --> 18:19.660]  the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage
[18:19.660 --> 18:21.880]  at Starbucks. It's the classic blended
[18:21.880 --> 18:23.500]  iced coffee you know and love,
[18:23.680 --> 18:26.040]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted
[18:26.040 --> 18:27.880]  brown sugar cold foam. Available
[18:27.880 --> 18:29.740]  for a limited time. Your Strato
[18:29.740 --> 18:31.380]  Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[18:31.860 --> 18:33.720]  Well, um, Gavin,
[18:34.240 --> 18:35.900]  those are our first two takes. What about
[18:35.900 --> 18:37.940]  you? What takes do you have? If you manage
[18:37.940 --> 18:39.880]  to fit it in your asshole, you should
[18:39.880 --> 18:40.920]  be allowed to smuggle it.
[18:42.260 --> 18:42.740]  Okay.
[18:44.200 --> 18:46.240]  Interesting. Very interesting.
[18:46.600 --> 18:48.280]  But you've got to the trouble of putting it
[18:48.280 --> 18:49.300]  in your anus.
[18:50.180 --> 18:51.900]  It should just be anything goes in
[18:51.900 --> 18:53.060]  the anus. Interesting.
[18:53.760 --> 18:55.900]  Okay, so if I'm
[18:56.720 --> 18:57.860]  bringing in a bunch
[18:57.860 --> 19:00.100]  of drugs and they catch
[19:00.100 --> 19:01.300]  me, let's say,
[19:01.880 --> 19:04.100]  but it's in my anus, I'm no longer
[19:04.100 --> 19:05.540]  going to be penalized for
[19:06.100 --> 19:07.820]  attempting to smuggle drugs? Yeah.
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.920]  I mean, you put it in your own anus. You went through the
[19:09.920 --> 19:11.380]  trouble of that. They're yours.
[19:11.980 --> 19:13.960]  Is there a consideration, though, that
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.740]  putting something in an anus is maybe
[19:15.740 --> 19:17.760]  too easy to it be an immunity
[19:17.760 --> 19:19.920]  spot? Uh...
[19:19.920 --> 19:22.020]  It's sort of like a bag. I mean, you've got a lot
[19:22.020 --> 19:23.820]  of runway there. You can lube it up.
[19:24.100 --> 19:25.500]  Like, it depends on...
[19:25.500 --> 19:27.940]  I guess what I'll say to that is
[19:27.940 --> 19:29.820]  that's big talk from someone
[19:29.820 --> 19:31.640]  who's not doing it. Ooh!
[19:33.940 --> 19:34.980]  I guess.
[19:35.100 --> 19:36.940]  I don't know. I just feel like...
[19:36.940 --> 19:38.560]  Here's the thing, and this is going
[19:38.560 --> 19:40.420]  in a direction that I didn't anticipate going.
[19:40.920 --> 19:42.580]  I've had some pretty massive
[19:42.580 --> 19:43.920]  shits which give me
[19:44.540 --> 19:46.460]  a concept of what's
[19:46.460 --> 19:48.740]  possible in there. I've never...
[19:48.740 --> 19:50.600]  I'm not putting things in. I'm
[19:50.600 --> 19:52.300]  pushing stuff out. I just don't agree.
[19:52.580 --> 19:54.320]  I just don't agree. And I feel like...
[19:54.320 --> 19:56.420]  No. No. I feel like
[19:56.420 --> 19:58.280]  it doesn't deserve complete
[19:58.280 --> 20:00.260]  immunity. You feel like you
[20:00.260 --> 20:02.380]  would have an advantage because you could smuggle a much
[20:02.380 --> 20:03.260]  bigger item than me?
[20:03.880 --> 20:06.100]  I don't think it's like... I'm not bragging
[20:06.100 --> 20:08.520]  or anything. I'm not saying I have an abnormal
[20:09.520 --> 20:10.520]  anus stretchability.
[20:10.700 --> 20:12.300]  I'm not like a Fantastic
[20:12.300 --> 20:14.020]  Four anally.
[20:14.740 --> 20:16.180]  But I do
[20:16.180 --> 20:18.300]  think that it might be... I don't know.
[20:18.420 --> 20:20.260]  It feels like it could be too...
[20:20.260 --> 20:22.080]  I don't know. It's an interesting
[20:22.080 --> 20:24.500]  take. What were you thinking of smuggling?
[20:25.580 --> 20:26.080]  Uh...
[20:26.080 --> 20:28.280]  There's a lot of people getting their anuses looked at
[20:28.280 --> 20:29.880]  by other people, isn't it? Sure.
[20:30.240 --> 20:32.440]  Getting stuff taken from their own anus.
[20:34.360 --> 20:36.300]  I just feel like that should
[20:36.300 --> 20:37.520]  be a safe space for people.
[20:37.740 --> 20:40.260]  You can't smuggle a lot. It's not like you
[20:40.260 --> 20:42.300]  could smuggle a boatload
[20:42.300 --> 20:44.420]  of heroin. Just enough for you.
[20:45.940 --> 20:48.060]  I think you'd be surprised how much heroin.
[20:48.280 --> 20:50.300]  Yeah, I think it would probably be quite a bit. I think it would be
[20:50.300 --> 20:52.320]  a lot. I think it would be a lot more than you think it would
[20:52.320 --> 20:54.340]  be in that case. Let's say then
[20:54.340 --> 20:56.320]  that it's only for the stuff that went up. It's not
[20:56.320 --> 20:58.200]  for the stuff you swallowed. What?
[20:58.580 --> 21:00.320]  I didn't even think about what
[21:00.320 --> 21:02.320]  you're saying, but I assume that was
[21:02.320 --> 21:04.320]  a rule. I assume it has
[21:04.320 --> 21:05.800]  to be the entry point of anal
[21:06.180 --> 21:08.200]  as opposed to swallowing. Yeah, because
[21:08.200 --> 21:10.320]  you can swallow a lot more than you
[21:10.320 --> 21:12.180]  can put up. At that point,
[21:12.220 --> 21:14.180]  your take would just be anything inside of you
[21:14.180 --> 21:16.700]  is fair game. What are you...
[21:16.700 --> 21:18.260]  I'm confused about
[21:18.260 --> 21:20.240]  what could be swallowed that you would smuggle.
[21:20.780 --> 21:22.300]  Heroin. Well, no, because
[21:22.300 --> 21:24.180]  I think your stomach would definitely break that down
[21:24.180 --> 21:26.040]  and you would die. Yeah, you don't swallow
[21:26.040 --> 21:28.040]  the raw heroin. You would put it in a Johnny,
[21:28.100 --> 21:29.480]  wouldn't you? Right, but even
[21:29.960 --> 21:31.240]  still, you don't think like
[21:31.240 --> 21:34.140]  the risk of swallowing... I just don't think it would pass
[21:34.140 --> 21:36.420]  through you. That was a movie thing.
[21:36.420 --> 21:37.180]  Of course it would.
[21:38.180 --> 21:40.340]  I think there was a thing where like...
[21:40.340 --> 21:42.220]  I've definitely seen a thing where someone swallowed a bunch
[21:42.220 --> 21:44.220]  of heroin and one of the bags burst.
[21:44.840 --> 21:45.720]  Oh yeah, I've heard of that.
[21:46.760 --> 21:48.180]  I just feel like the risk
[21:48.180 --> 21:50.140]  of swallowing it and it
[21:50.140 --> 21:52.060]  bursting is so much higher than
[21:52.060 --> 21:54.020]  just sticking it up. Because I
[21:54.020 --> 21:55.960]  agree, I think if you swallow it, no fair game.
[21:56.080 --> 21:57.540]  But if you put it up, fair game.
[21:58.040 --> 22:00.240]  I wouldn't be using it for drugs, though. I'd be using it just to avoid
[22:00.900 --> 22:01.620]  importing something.
[22:02.640 --> 22:03.320]  Like what?
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.420]  Like what? Yeah.
[22:05.780 --> 22:07.980]  I don't know, like a small but high
[22:07.980 --> 22:09.880]  value item. I don't know, man.
[22:09.980 --> 22:12.120]  Like if I had a fancy ring
[22:12.120 --> 22:14.140]  or something, I'd put it in my arse
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.940]  and then I wouldn't have... A ring?
[22:15.940 --> 22:17.740]  Yeah, like say I went to a place
[22:18.340 --> 22:20.060]  where the ring was cheaper to buy,
[22:20.060 --> 22:21.860]  I'd buy it, pop it in my arse,
[22:21.960 --> 22:23.020]  and travel back with it.
[22:23.960 --> 22:25.160]  Couldn't you just wear it?
[22:25.580 --> 22:26.520]  That's a bad example.
[22:30.460 --> 22:31.520]  Are you just
[22:32.020 --> 22:33.520]  trying to put stuff... What about a watch?
[22:33.520 --> 22:34.480]  What are you talking about?
[22:35.460 --> 22:38.320]  Christopher Walken did it. Yeah, Christopher Walken did do it.
[22:38.740 --> 22:39.700]  He put a watch in his arse?
[22:40.180 --> 22:41.300]  Yeah. In Pulp Fiction.
[22:41.720 --> 22:43.200]  Oh. The whole monologue.
[22:43.720 --> 22:45.460]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[22:45.480 --> 22:47.300]  What about this? What if...
[22:47.300 --> 22:49.420]  Okay, so let's say you smuggle something
[22:49.420 --> 22:51.460]  legally through your arse.
[22:51.780 --> 22:52.080]  Okay.
[22:52.760 --> 22:55.400]  Then you pop it out of your arse and commit a crime
[22:55.400 --> 22:57.180]  with it. Is that crime also
[22:57.180 --> 22:58.680]  legal? No, no, no.
[22:58.700 --> 22:59.980]  It's not like a golden bullet.
[23:00.380 --> 23:01.580]  It's not a golden bullet situation.
[23:03.260 --> 23:05.060]  What made me think of it was, you know,
[23:05.120 --> 23:06.680]  in Left 4 Dead, you've got the safe houses
[23:06.680 --> 23:08.920]  where zombies just can't affect you.
[23:09.240 --> 23:11.580]  It's your moment to chill. It's your safe space.
[23:11.680 --> 23:13.440]  You're guaranteed that nothing bad
[23:13.440 --> 23:14.660]  is going to happen until you open the door.
[23:14.660 --> 23:17.040]  I just want a real life safe space
[23:17.040 --> 23:18.320]  and what better space
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.120]  than my natural
[23:20.640 --> 23:21.500]  God-given pocket.
[23:22.200 --> 23:24.200]  But I keep wondering, like, what do you
[23:25.480 --> 23:26.540]  mean about having
[23:26.540 --> 23:28.460]  stuff up there? Like, what is your example
[23:28.460 --> 23:30.180]  of stuff? Lump of gold?
[23:30.980 --> 23:31.220]  Okay.
[23:33.440 --> 23:34.740]  But why do you
[23:35.720 --> 23:36.620]  have to do that, I guess,
[23:36.680 --> 23:37.360]  is my question.
[23:38.020 --> 23:40.580]  I don't know. I just wanted a place that no one would ever look.
[23:41.540 --> 23:42.580]  But they do look.
[23:42.580 --> 23:44.280]  Yeah, that's my point.
[23:44.520 --> 23:46.600]  They shouldn't. Do they have to manually
[23:46.600 --> 23:48.560]  look still? I feel like we should be at a point
[23:48.560 --> 23:50.500]  with technology that they can just tell if you have
[23:50.500 --> 23:51.600]  something in your ass or not.
[23:51.940 --> 23:54.420]  I like the idea of getting put in the x-ray
[23:54.420 --> 23:55.920]  and they can see the watch in there.
[23:56.020 --> 23:58.360]  They're like, oh, you little rascal. You put it in your ass. Go on.
[23:58.580 --> 23:59.300]  Get out of here, you.
[23:59.640 --> 24:02.200]  Yeah, with their watch.
[24:02.460 --> 24:02.580]  Yep.
[24:05.580 --> 24:06.520]  Now, okay, let's
[24:06.520 --> 24:08.060]  just expand on this for you personally.
[24:08.840 --> 24:10.240]  Let's say that this was a socially
[24:10.240 --> 24:12.100]  acceptable thing. What do you think you would just
[24:12.100 --> 24:14.220]  carry in it whenever you went out? Would it be something
[24:14.220 --> 24:15.340]  you regularly used?
[24:16.480 --> 24:17.700]  I'm trying to think.
[24:17.980 --> 24:20.140]  I've just always been
[24:20.140 --> 24:22.100]  scared of moving stuff between countries
[24:22.100 --> 24:24.000]  that I own. Because I'm like,
[24:24.020 --> 24:26.120]  they're going to think I've bought that and I'm
[24:26.120 --> 24:28.080]  illegally importing it. And I just want
[24:28.080 --> 24:29.960]  the security of my ass.
[24:30.220 --> 24:32.060]  But I also couldn't fit an Xbox
[24:32.060 --> 24:34.000]  in my ass and stuff. Yeah, that would be a problem.
[24:34.480 --> 24:36.040]  That would have to be several flights
[24:36.040 --> 24:37.540]  and piece by piece.
[24:37.540 --> 24:39.620]  I like this take because it's truly
[24:39.620 --> 24:41.540]  insane. And I keep asking
[24:41.540 --> 24:43.620]  for examples and I don't feel like I'm getting
[24:43.620 --> 24:45.720]  any, so I'm really on board for this.
[24:45.980 --> 24:47.660]  I'll be honest, I can't think of a single
[24:47.660 --> 24:49.640]  item that I would actually use this on.
[24:49.760 --> 24:51.660]  I just think people who put stuff up
[24:51.660 --> 24:52.820]  their ass to go through
[24:55.360 --> 24:55.800]  passport
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.800]  checks and stuff, they've gone through a lot.
[24:58.320 --> 24:59.480]  They've got a lot of effort involved.
[24:59.560 --> 25:01.560]  It just feels like the
[25:01.560 --> 25:03.440]  worst surprise you could have.
[25:03.880 --> 25:05.520]  Yeah. Like if we went out
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.520]  on a picnic and I was like,
[25:07.600 --> 25:09.460]  oh man, I forgot to bring
[25:09.460 --> 25:11.480]  dessert. And you're like, don't worry, I
[25:11.480 --> 25:13.520]  got some cookies right here. Just give me a second.
[25:14.660 --> 25:15.600]  Why would he do that
[25:15.600 --> 25:17.460]  with cookies? I was just thinking
[25:17.460 --> 25:18.840]  like a bag of cookies.
[25:19.560 --> 25:20.880]  Right, right.
[25:21.040 --> 25:22.980]  Why would he do that with cookies?
[25:23.260 --> 25:25.260]  Why is he storing anything in his anus?
[25:25.440 --> 25:27.160]  Because it seems like it's illegal
[25:27.160 --> 25:29.520]  to get this from country to country.
[25:29.640 --> 25:30.760]  He started arguing.
[25:31.360 --> 25:33.640]  You're talking about using it, but he's saying
[25:33.640 --> 25:35.600]  a safe place where people won't
[25:35.600 --> 25:37.400]  go. That makes sense for maybe
[25:37.400 --> 25:39.720]  potentially illegal activities. What you're saying
[25:39.720 --> 25:41.640]  is we go on a picnic and he
[25:41.640 --> 25:43.760]  pulls Oreos out of his
[25:43.760 --> 25:45.580]  ass. He did
[25:45.580 --> 25:47.580]  mention that he just wants to use his
[25:47.580 --> 25:49.560]  God-given pouch or whatever. I don't know
[25:49.560 --> 25:50.700]  what that wording was, but
[25:52.820 --> 25:53.620]  I don't know what
[25:53.620 --> 25:55.680]  he said, but it was something about he wanted to use
[25:55.680 --> 25:56.520]  his anal pouch.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.620]  So at the point in which he just wants to use
[25:59.620 --> 26:01.220]  it, then I think you have to, like,
[26:01.220 --> 26:03.200]  it becomes a day-to-day thing for him.
[26:03.620 --> 26:05.300]  Does it? I think so.
[26:05.300 --> 26:07.080]  Gavin, does it feel like it becomes a day-to-day thing to you?
[26:07.120 --> 26:09.380]  No, I don't need to use it every day. I'd hardly ever use it.
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.260]  This feels like
[26:11.260 --> 26:13.220]  a really weird thing to fight for, then, if
[26:13.220 --> 26:14.480]  it's something you don't want to really use.
[26:14.580 --> 26:16.120]  What about this?
[26:17.140 --> 26:19.180]  Sometimes I have trouble
[26:19.180 --> 26:19.800]  sleeping.
[26:21.240 --> 26:23.380]  Get some of those melatonin
[26:23.380 --> 26:24.680]  gummies, right?
[26:25.200 --> 26:26.140]  To help me sleep.
[26:26.900 --> 26:29.080]  But I don't think you're allowed to bring those
[26:29.080 --> 26:30.360]  to England.
[26:30.860 --> 26:32.740]  So whenever I come to England, I'm all like
[26:32.740 --> 26:34.740]  insomnia and stuff. If I just
[26:34.740 --> 26:36.820]  pulled a week's worth of gummies out of my ass,
[26:37.100 --> 26:39.080]  fine. I honestly don't know if they're checking for
[26:39.080 --> 26:40.760]  those. I have no idea if they'd actually
[26:40.760 --> 26:43.020]  confiscate that. That's the world I
[26:43.020 --> 26:45.000]  want to live in, is that you're smuggling things
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.940]  anally that you don't have to, but just
[26:46.940 --> 26:48.940]  assume aren't allowed. I like that
[26:48.940 --> 26:50.560]  reality a lot.
[26:50.920 --> 26:53.280]  Can I bring melatonin from the US
[26:53.280 --> 26:55.000]  to the UK? Not finding a
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.820]  clear answer. First comment.
[26:56.820 --> 26:58.880]  It's not illegal to bring
[26:58.880 --> 27:01.020]  in. It's just illegal for someone to sell
[27:01.020 --> 27:02.760]  to you in the UK without a prescription.
[27:03.340 --> 27:04.840]  Second comment. Yes,
[27:04.900 --> 27:05.820]  you can bring it.
[27:06.840 --> 27:08.820]  Third comment. You can
[27:08.820 --> 27:10.800]  order melatonin over the internet
[27:10.800 --> 27:13.120]  into the UK from the US.
[27:13.900 --> 27:14.800]  I bring it to
[27:14.800 --> 27:16.760]  home every time I go.
[27:18.480 --> 27:20.880]  Now imagine how embarrassing it is if he's
[27:20.880 --> 27:22.860]  huddled over a toilet while
[27:22.860 --> 27:24.600]  reading this trying to get his melatonin.
[27:25.800 --> 27:26.240]  Wow.
[27:26.660 --> 27:28.600]  Here's the thing. I think I like your
[27:28.600 --> 27:30.720]  take. I don't think I like any of your uses
[27:30.720 --> 27:32.480]  for the take. I think that's the thing.
[27:32.560 --> 27:34.620]  I like the idea of my take, but
[27:34.620 --> 27:36.720]  not only do I not know
[27:36.720 --> 27:38.880]  what I put in my ass, I've never experienced
[27:38.880 --> 27:40.600]  putting anything in my ass, apart from
[27:40.600 --> 27:42.080]  the occasional woman's finger.
[27:42.660 --> 27:44.840]  Sure. You've never had like a
[27:44.840 --> 27:46.400]  what's the word I'm looking for?
[27:46.480 --> 27:48.140]  They put the tube in your ass.
[27:49.080 --> 27:49.960]  Medical procedure.
[27:50.520 --> 27:51.180]  Like a colonoscopy?
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.940]  A colonoscopy, thank you.
[27:52.960 --> 27:55.060]  You've never had one of those or like an enema?
[27:55.580 --> 27:55.820]  No.
[27:57.220 --> 27:58.360]  No, just a finger.
[28:00.160 --> 28:00.880]  Just a
[28:01.640 --> 28:02.360]  just a
[28:03.500 --> 28:04.220]  surprising finger.
[28:10.380 --> 28:11.120]  I'm going to be
[28:11.120 --> 28:12.680]  thinking about your take all day, Gavin.
[28:13.060 --> 28:15.200]  It's all I'm going to be thinking about for the rest of this day.
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.960]  Look, I told you I thought I've done this wrong.
[28:17.420 --> 28:18.480]  No, you did it right.
[28:18.480 --> 28:20.240]  But you didn't. I don't think you did it wrong.
[28:20.380 --> 28:21.920]  No, I don't think you did it wrong at all.
[28:22.120 --> 28:24.140]  I really, truly don't think you did it wrong.
[28:24.440 --> 28:24.560]  Yeah.
[28:26.520 --> 28:28.340]  I don't think I've ever heard Nick
[28:28.340 --> 28:30.160]  so confused in the background.
[28:30.820 --> 28:31.780]  It's very exciting.
[28:32.060 --> 28:32.900]  I'm thrilled.
[28:33.560 --> 28:35.560]  I'm thrilled about this.
[28:36.280 --> 28:37.100]  So, great.
[28:37.840 --> 28:40.020]  But, that's Gavin's take.
[28:40.240 --> 28:41.920]  That's pretty exciting. Nick,
[28:42.020 --> 28:43.980]  we have your very first take.
[28:45.180 --> 28:45.960]  I feel
[28:45.960 --> 28:48.060]  Well, what an act
[28:48.060 --> 28:48.420]  to follow.
[28:49.720 --> 28:51.900]  I feel that I'm going to take some heat
[28:51.900 --> 28:53.860]  for this. In fact,
[28:53.920 --> 28:55.820]  I know I'm going to take heat for this because I believe
[28:55.820 --> 28:57.560]  I am very much in the minority on this.
[28:59.060 --> 29:00.000]  I would like
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.620]  to say that the
[29:01.620 --> 29:03.920]  inverted control scheme is
[29:03.920 --> 29:05.960]  the correct control scheme.
[29:05.960 --> 29:06.460]  You're insane. You're an idiot.
[29:06.900 --> 29:09.720]  I think we talked about this. You're nuts.
[29:10.040 --> 29:11.820]  I think Gavin made a comment
[29:11.820 --> 29:13.600]  about something we played recently
[29:13.600 --> 29:15.340]  and saw that you did inverted controls
[29:15.340 --> 29:16.300]  and thought you were crazy.
[29:16.640 --> 29:19.400]  Does that mean, Nick, that when you get in a vehicle, like a plane
[29:19.400 --> 29:21.500]  in a video game or a banshee or something,
[29:21.740 --> 29:23.740]  are you now not inverted or are you inverted
[29:23.740 --> 29:25.080]  on both? Inverted on both.
[29:25.120 --> 29:27.000]  It makes no sense. What do you mean?
[29:27.260 --> 29:29.780]  Think about how your head moves.
[29:29.800 --> 29:30.780]  Yeah, I move my head.
[29:31.360 --> 29:33.400]  It's moved by my neck, up and down.
[29:33.740 --> 29:35.560]  It's not flown like a plane.
[29:35.680 --> 29:37.540]  No one's steering my head with a stick
[29:37.540 --> 29:38.740]  through the back of my head.
[29:38.840 --> 29:41.680]  When you tilt your head to look up, you're tilting your head
[29:41.680 --> 29:43.660]  backward, which is the way that you're doing it
[29:43.660 --> 29:45.680]  on the controller. Yeah, but there's
[29:45.680 --> 29:47.600]  no stick coming out the back of my head.
[29:47.680 --> 29:49.780]  No one's got their thumb on a stick
[29:49.780 --> 29:51.140]  on the back of my head. Fine.
[29:51.620 --> 29:53.500]  Gavin, let's look at it from your perspective then.
[29:53.520 --> 29:55.700]  Let's talk about operating a
[29:55.700 --> 29:57.760]  camera. When you tilt to look up,
[29:58.040 --> 30:00.020]  which way do you pull the camera?
[30:00.640 --> 30:01.600]  If I tilt to look
[30:01.600 --> 30:03.560]  up, I push
[30:03.560 --> 30:05.660]  down on the stick because it's a
[30:05.660 --> 30:07.260]  stick coming out the back.
[30:07.640 --> 30:09.660]  You pull it back. But if the camera was on
[30:09.660 --> 30:11.420]  my head, you would look up.
[30:11.540 --> 30:12.620]  You're still tilting your head back.
[30:13.060 --> 30:15.860]  You would look up to look up.
[30:16.500 --> 30:17.820]  You're tilting back
[30:17.820 --> 30:19.580]  to look up. You're tilting
[30:19.580 --> 30:20.800]  forward to look down.
[30:21.280 --> 30:23.140]  You don't look back or forward.
[30:23.220 --> 30:24.340]  You look up and down.
[30:24.800 --> 30:27.200]  So you invert up and down.
[30:27.520 --> 30:28.640]  Do you invert left and right?
[30:29.160 --> 30:30.240]  No, God, no. That's wrong.
[30:30.760 --> 30:32.940]  You're steering your head to the right.
[30:32.960 --> 30:34.760]  I don't understand what the fuck you're saying then.
[30:35.420 --> 30:37.400]  Okay, so Nick, I've got a camera, right?
[30:37.400 --> 30:39.120]  I want the camera to look to the right.
[30:39.320 --> 30:41.500]  I take the stick coming off the back
[30:41.500 --> 30:43.400]  of the camera, and I move it in which direction?
[30:43.960 --> 30:44.940]  I turn the camera right.
[30:45.260 --> 30:46.700]  You turn the camera right by doing what?
[30:47.480 --> 30:49.300]  By turning it right. Yeah, by pushing
[30:49.300 --> 30:50.520]  the stick to the left, huh?
[30:50.940 --> 30:52.480]  If you invert your up and down,
[30:53.200 --> 30:54.820]  you should be inverting your left and right.
[30:55.300 --> 30:56.400]  That's absolutely true.
[30:56.700 --> 30:58.860]  Now that's a take right there.
[30:59.120 --> 31:01.020]  That is a take. I will say this.
[31:01.560 --> 31:01.820]  Touche.
[31:01.820 --> 31:01.860]  Okay.
[31:04.980 --> 31:05.860]  But also,
[31:06.160 --> 31:08.160]  now I'm just going to go back to the flying one.
[31:08.780 --> 31:10.520]  You turn lefty,
[31:10.560 --> 31:11.820]  you go lefty. You turn righty,
[31:11.840 --> 31:13.380]  you go righty. You pull back to go up.
[31:13.560 --> 31:15.420]  You push down, go down.
[31:15.700 --> 31:17.300]  Or push forward, go down.
[31:17.880 --> 31:20.060]  So I'm going to stick with the flight controls.
[31:20.280 --> 31:21.260]  Inverted is correct,
[31:21.540 --> 31:23.380]  but only on the y-axis.
[31:25.420 --> 31:26.300]  So how did you
[31:26.300 --> 31:27.560]  become inverted?
[31:28.780 --> 31:29.880]  Halo. It's literally
[31:29.880 --> 31:32.160]  thanks to Halo. Yeah, but Halo isn't by default
[31:32.160 --> 31:34.080]  inverted. It's not,
[31:34.340 --> 31:36.260]  but I remember...
[31:36.260 --> 31:37.000]  No, but listen,
[31:37.720 --> 31:40.020]  they do that whole tutorial bit at the beginning
[31:40.020 --> 31:41.720]  where the chief comes out of cryo sleep
[31:41.720 --> 31:43.700]  and they have you do the control thing.
[31:43.760 --> 31:45.420]  Like, look left, look right, look up, look down.
[31:45.540 --> 31:47.840]  And then I remember being like, well, try this
[31:47.840 --> 31:48.820]  up and down.
[31:49.260 --> 31:51.580]  In the moment, I was like, I don't
[31:51.580 --> 31:53.800]  feel anything different. So I just went with whatever
[31:53.800 --> 31:55.000]  the second one was.
[31:56.080 --> 31:57.660]  And ever since then,
[31:58.020 --> 31:59.500]  inverted is the way to be.
[31:59.760 --> 32:01.380]  So why are you blaming Halo then?
[32:01.820 --> 32:03.260]  Did you only play Halo? Because it gave me the option?
[32:05.100 --> 32:05.760]  Like, I'm trying
[32:05.760 --> 32:07.560]  to understand. I get Halo
[32:07.560 --> 32:09.500]  playing that way, but then you go to a different
[32:09.500 --> 32:11.620]  game, and then you have to go into the
[32:11.620 --> 32:13.620]  settings and change it. Yeah, well, I mean,
[32:13.620 --> 32:15.580]  at that point, it was so ingrained because I played
[32:15.580 --> 32:17.400]  a lot of Halo that it was just
[32:17.400 --> 32:19.340]  everything else made me feel sick and slow.
[32:19.600 --> 32:21.400]  Did you not play a first-person shooter
[32:21.400 --> 32:23.780]  prior to Halo? There weren't a ton,
[32:23.840 --> 32:25.460]  though. Well, there were so many.
[32:25.460 --> 32:27.340]  Like Doom? On a controller?
[32:27.900 --> 32:28.720]  Quake? On a controller?
[32:29.960 --> 32:30.320]  GoldenEye?
[32:31.160 --> 32:33.420]  I mean, but GoldenEye was... I think GoldenEye was
[32:33.420 --> 32:35.420]  inverted. GoldenEye, you didn't look up
[32:35.420 --> 32:37.340]  or down unless you stopped. Yeah, unless you were
[32:37.340 --> 32:39.240]  aiming. I guess, yeah.
[32:39.780 --> 32:41.180]  Right. So you looked up and down.
[32:41.180 --> 32:43.340]  No, I mean, unless you were going through the crosshairs. Most of the time,
[32:43.380 --> 32:45.560]  you can just shoot. Right, so you would look up and down.
[32:46.640 --> 32:47.140]  I would
[32:47.140 --> 32:49.360]  not look up and down that much in GoldenEye. I would never look up and down.
[32:49.400 --> 32:51.600]  Me neither. I'm not saying that I did it.
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.520]  I'm saying that it was there and you could do it.
[32:53.520 --> 32:54.700]  I mean, yeah, now.
[32:55.280 --> 32:56.520]  What does that mean?
[32:58.640 --> 32:59.440]  What do you mean?
[32:59.680 --> 33:01.580]  So is your take
[33:01.580 --> 33:03.820]  that every game should be
[33:03.820 --> 33:05.200]  inverted by default?
[33:05.540 --> 33:07.220]  Yeah, and I think that people should
[33:07.220 --> 33:09.320]  give it a shot because it's better.
[33:09.840 --> 33:11.060]  It's more comfortable. Why would everyone
[33:11.820 --> 33:13.440]  invert it? The word inverted
[33:13.440 --> 33:15.260]  basically just means like backwards
[33:15.260 --> 33:17.820]  or flipped. It's like it's not the default.
[33:18.020 --> 33:19.460]  It says there's no
[33:19.460 --> 33:21.360]  verted. There's normal
[33:21.360 --> 33:22.480]  and inverted.
[33:24.980 --> 33:27.200]  Hey, you guys playing this inverted
[33:27.200 --> 33:29.160]  or verted? Oh, these controls are verted.
[33:29.260 --> 33:31.280]  As someone who plays everything verted and then
[33:31.280 --> 33:33.020]  I swap controls with someone who doesn't,
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.060]  I'm just like, all it does for you, Nick,
[33:35.140 --> 33:36.700]  surely, is cause arguments
[33:36.700 --> 33:37.980]  from verted people.
[33:40.000 --> 33:40.840]  Well, yes,
[33:41.300 --> 33:42.680]  it does, and that's why
[33:42.680 --> 33:44.740]  I decided to be brave and
[33:45.240 --> 33:47.080]  tell my story about how Hillary
[33:47.080 --> 33:47.660]  made my life.
[33:47.660 --> 33:49.700]  All these verts
[33:49.700 --> 33:50.500]  coming for you.
[33:51.500 --> 33:53.180]  Are you going to pass down
[33:53.180 --> 33:55.220]  this hindrance to your child?
[33:55.800 --> 33:57.320]  That's exactly what I wanted to know.
[33:57.780 --> 33:59.160]  Interesting question.
[33:59.940 --> 34:01.580]  Is he going to get a choice
[34:01.580 --> 34:03.440]  in this or are you just going to start feeding them
[34:03.440 --> 34:05.360]  inverted controls without him knowing?
[34:06.020 --> 34:07.540]  You know, I wouldn't have
[34:07.540 --> 34:09.480]  to switch the control scheme when we handed the
[34:09.480 --> 34:11.740]  controller off. Yeah, he's going to learn
[34:11.740 --> 34:12.120]  inverted.
[34:13.360 --> 34:14.640]  He's flying right.
[34:14.640 --> 34:16.540]  Yeah, wait, that sounded wrong.
[34:16.560 --> 34:17.320]  He's flying true.
[34:19.620 --> 34:22.600]  No, y-axis.
[34:24.700 --> 34:26.600]  This take is, I can't wait for the
[34:26.600 --> 34:27.940]  verts to come after you. I thought
[34:28.440 --> 34:30.540]  Gavin's take was going to get slammed. I definitely think
[34:30.540 --> 34:31.460]  Nick's take is going to get slammed.
[34:32.940 --> 34:34.560]  Gavin emboldened me to be wrong.
[34:35.220 --> 34:36.720]  Yeah, I know. I played GTA
[34:36.720 --> 34:38.760]  with both of you. I've seen how it works.
[34:39.860 --> 34:40.320]  We should
[34:40.320 --> 34:42.660]  film a let's play at some point where
[34:42.660 --> 34:44.840]  Nick has to play verted and the rest of us
[34:44.840 --> 34:46.680]  all have to do inverted. That is such
[34:46.680 --> 34:48.740]  a good idea. I mean, I don't
[34:48.740 --> 34:50.780]  want to do it, but that would be terrible.
[34:51.060 --> 34:52.680]  I think it would
[34:52.680 --> 34:54.720]  be easier for the verteds
[34:54.720 --> 34:56.600]  to use inverted because
[34:56.600 --> 34:58.400]  we fly planes inverted in games.
[34:58.600 --> 35:00.420]  Oh, that's an interesting idea. But you don't fly shit.
[35:00.420 --> 35:02.500]  It's a very interesting take, yeah. Backwards.
[35:03.120 --> 35:04.000]  Or normally.
[35:04.760 --> 35:06.220]  Very curious. Well,
[35:06.740 --> 35:07.940]  Nick, great take.
[35:08.460 --> 35:10.940]  I think we could do one more take each.
[35:10.940 --> 35:12.820]  Do you think one more take each or do you think we
[35:12.820 --> 35:14.980]  wrap up? No, no, we gotta do one more
[35:14.980 --> 35:16.940]  take each. I'm so curious to see what else Gavin has
[35:16.940 --> 35:18.920]  to say. That's fair. Do you
[35:18.920 --> 35:21.100]  have another take, Gavin, or do you only have one take?
[35:21.460 --> 35:22.860]  Oh, I wrote like 10. I thought this was
[35:22.860 --> 35:24.000]  going to be phenomenal.
[35:24.760 --> 35:26.820]  Let's go back around the horn. Let's start with
[35:26.820 --> 35:28.960]  Andrew, and then let's go back around
[35:28.960 --> 35:30.420]  the horn. My sick take?
[35:31.020 --> 35:32.980]  We get one real animal movie
[35:32.980 --> 35:34.660]  a year. I know
[35:34.660 --> 35:36.700]  making movies with real animals
[35:36.700 --> 35:38.900]  isn't ethical, so
[35:38.900 --> 35:40.800]  we use CG animals now
[35:40.800 --> 35:42.780]  almost all the time, but it just
[35:42.780 --> 35:44.780]  doesn't hit the same. It's not as
[35:44.780 --> 35:46.540]  fun. It's not as entertaining.
[35:46.960 --> 35:49.040]  I think we should be allowed morally
[35:49.040 --> 35:50.860]  to have one film a
[35:50.860 --> 35:52.840]  year that is real animals
[35:52.840 --> 35:54.860]  in all of the roles, and it's like the big
[35:54.860 --> 35:56.940]  real animal movie of the summer or
[35:56.940 --> 35:58.580]  year. That is my take.
[35:59.060 --> 36:00.780]  I really have almost truly
[36:00.780 --> 36:01.880]  no opinion on this.
[36:02.880 --> 36:04.860]  Who's the board that decides, oh,
[36:04.900 --> 36:06.580]  this is the movie that gets the real animal?
[36:06.580 --> 36:08.020]  Oh, that's
[36:08.520 --> 36:10.800]  I, you know, I think maybe it rotates
[36:10.800 --> 36:12.580]  by major studio each year.
[36:12.680 --> 36:14.140]  A major studio has the
[36:14.140 --> 36:16.540]  I don't know if you want to say right
[36:16.540 --> 36:18.640]  or like they've been penalized with
[36:18.640 --> 36:20.520]  making a fully real
[36:20.520 --> 36:22.500]  animal movie, and it just rotates,
[36:22.840 --> 36:24.080]  but there's only one,
[36:24.620 --> 36:26.240]  and there's a lot of expectation
[36:26.240 --> 36:28.660]  on that movie delivering because of that
[36:28.660 --> 36:30.420]  because I'm sick of the CG.
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.280]  I saw a trailer for
[36:32.280 --> 36:34.700]  cats versus dogs three recently,
[36:34.700 --> 36:36.880]  which I didn't know is a thing they made a third
[36:36.880 --> 36:38.940]  of, and they're all CG, and it looks like
[36:38.940 --> 36:41.040]  shit. That's just now they look like shit.
[36:41.380 --> 36:42.600]  What do you mean? Surely eventually
[36:43.200 --> 36:44.680]  20 years from now, you won't be able to tell.
[36:44.940 --> 36:47.040]  I don't think that's true. I think he'll always be able to tell.
[36:47.500 --> 36:48.800]  He doesn't want to wait the 20 years, though.
[36:48.840 --> 36:50.860]  I don't want to wait. He wants a real cat and a real
[36:50.860 --> 36:52.920]  dog doing something. And I also, yeah,
[36:52.940 --> 36:54.880]  I want to know that it's a real dog playing
[36:54.880 --> 36:56.860]  football. I want a real dog running out there
[36:56.860 --> 36:57.540]  getting that ball.
[36:58.820 --> 37:00.840]  Dude, if the end of Homeward
[37:00.840 --> 37:02.500]  Bound was
[37:03.720 --> 37:04.560]  CG dogs
[37:04.560 --> 37:06.300]  and a cat walking back home,
[37:06.340 --> 37:08.460]  it would not be as impactful, so
[37:08.460 --> 37:09.640]  maybe I agree with this.
[37:10.960 --> 37:12.500]  I haven't thought about that. I think it just doesn't
[37:12.500 --> 37:14.420]  hit the same. Do you want the animal to be doing
[37:14.420 --> 37:16.520]  its own stunts as well, or are you okay with a CG
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  double? No! I want it doing
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.440]  the stunts. Well, this might be where
[37:20.440 --> 37:22.380]  we diverge. This is where it becomes
[37:22.380 --> 37:24.280]  unethical. Like, say a dog
[37:24.280 --> 37:26.340]  has to escape a burning building
[37:26.340 --> 37:27.800]  with a zip line.
[37:29.180 --> 37:30.340]  How are you doing that?
[37:30.340 --> 37:32.720]  I don't know. I'm not a fucking stunt coordinator.
[37:32.940 --> 37:34.360]  How does Tom Cruise
[37:34.900 --> 37:36.220]  stand on an airplane wing?
[37:36.800 --> 37:38.520]  There are people that are professionals
[37:38.520 --> 37:40.280]  that figure out how to film that.
[37:40.560 --> 37:42.080]  Fucking now what, Gavin?
[37:43.340 --> 37:44.400]  You're asking me
[37:44.400 --> 37:46.540]  how do I set up a safe stunt? I don't do
[37:46.540 --> 37:48.500]  that, but there's an industry of people
[37:48.500 --> 37:50.480]  that that's their job. I will trust
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.420]  them. Gavin, take that
[37:52.420 --> 37:53.240]  and shove it up your anus.
[37:53.460 --> 37:56.340]  He doesn't give a fuck about
[37:56.340 --> 37:58.460]  how it's done. He just wants to watch
[37:58.460 --> 37:59.100]  the end result.
[38:00.120 --> 38:02.540]  Here's the thing. I want it to be done safely.
[38:02.860 --> 38:04.500]  How is it done safely? I don't
[38:04.500 --> 38:06.400]  fucking know. That's not my job. I don't
[38:06.400 --> 38:07.520]  live in that world.
[38:08.060 --> 38:10.020]  But there are professionals that do.
[38:11.580 --> 38:12.580]  And I trust
[38:12.580 --> 38:13.860]  that they will figure it out.
[38:16.700 --> 38:17.920]  Oh my God.
[38:17.960 --> 38:20.440]  I just want a real animal movie
[38:20.440 --> 38:22.280]  because they all suck now.
[38:23.660 --> 38:24.340]  They're not
[38:24.340 --> 38:25.640]  doing goofy stuff.
[38:25.640 --> 38:27.260]  You're not going to see Bingo
[38:27.260 --> 38:29.420]  on trial on planet Earth.
[38:29.580 --> 38:31.620]  Bingo on trial? Remember the Bingo
[38:31.620 --> 38:33.580]  movie? Something we should watch.
[38:34.340 --> 38:35.660]  He's on the stand.
[38:36.060 --> 38:37.400]  Now are you okay with the fact that
[38:37.400 --> 38:39.720]  the animal is probably going to get
[38:39.720 --> 38:41.420]  uncomfortable and hurt
[38:41.420 --> 38:43.620]  while it's filming? That's the thing. That's why
[38:43.620 --> 38:45.380]  it's morally unethical and why
[38:45.380 --> 38:47.580]  we stopped doing this as a
[38:47.580 --> 38:49.660]  culture. But
[38:49.660 --> 38:51.520]  I think we can be allowed
[38:51.520 --> 38:53.620]  one per year. Did we
[38:53.620 --> 38:55.940]  stop doing it? There's still animals in films.
[38:56.400 --> 38:57.240]  Not really.
[38:57.300 --> 38:58.760]  Not in the way it used to be.
[38:58.980 --> 39:01.380]  He wants full animal film.
[39:01.780 --> 39:03.780]  He doesn't want, like, here's a section
[39:03.780 --> 39:05.140]  about animal. He wants
[39:05.140 --> 39:07.540]  full on. Not like, these people are riding
[39:07.540 --> 39:08.540]  a horse sort of thing.
[39:09.400 --> 39:11.840]  Right. If the movie was about the horse
[39:11.840 --> 39:13.820]  all the way, then absolutely.
[39:14.740 --> 39:15.600]  I want MVP
[39:15.600 --> 39:16.800]  4 with a real monkey.
[39:17.260 --> 39:19.580]  That's all I want. I don't feel like
[39:19.580 --> 39:20.340]  it's a huge ask.
[39:20.340 --> 39:22.380]  But I understand it's unethical.
[39:22.680 --> 39:24.040]  When I emailed that zoo
[39:24.040 --> 39:25.900]  where Louis from MVP
[39:25.900 --> 39:28.140]  is currently residing, they were
[39:28.140 --> 39:30.220]  very clear that they do not support the
[39:30.220 --> 39:32.280]  MVP movies or animals in film in general.
[39:32.460 --> 39:34.660]  I get it. I support it.
[39:35.120 --> 39:36.540]  But we could do one.
[39:36.740 --> 39:38.440]  We could do one per year and make sure
[39:38.440 --> 39:40.560]  it's really safe and everything's all good.
[39:41.160 --> 39:42.660]  We could do one.
[39:43.060 --> 39:43.800]  And that's my take.
[39:44.580 --> 39:46.520]  One real animal movie per year
[39:46.520 --> 39:47.160]  should be allowed.
[39:49.100 --> 39:49.580]  That's...
[39:49.580 --> 39:50.900]  Well, there you go.
[39:52.140 --> 39:53.080]  This episode
[39:53.080 --> 39:54.780]  is brought to you by State Farm.

[40:43.340 --> 40:44.700]  St. Louis, Missouri.
[40:44.700 --> 40:46.860]  That's it. Eric, what's your take?
[40:47.280 --> 40:47.560]  Wow.
[40:48.380 --> 40:50.700]  My take is one that
[40:50.700 --> 40:52.880]  in my lifetime, I think
[40:52.880 --> 40:54.600]  it was something that
[40:54.600 --> 40:56.860]  we wanted and then got
[40:56.860 --> 40:58.740]  but too much of a good thing has
[40:58.740 --> 41:00.580]  become sort of what
[41:00.580 --> 41:01.860]  this thing is.
[41:02.440 --> 41:04.680]  I think my hot take
[41:04.680 --> 41:06.560]  is not everything needs
[41:06.560 --> 41:07.220]  lore.
[41:08.420 --> 41:10.580]  At one point in movies,
[41:10.740 --> 41:12.760]  a movie would just be a movie and we
[41:12.760 --> 41:14.880]  didn't have to know everything about every character.
[41:15.120 --> 41:16.780]  We didn't have to have backstories about every
[41:16.780 --> 41:18.640]  single thing. Not everything was a big franchise.
[41:19.360 --> 41:20.760]  Sometimes a movie was just
[41:20.760 --> 41:22.880]  a movie. Sometimes a TV show is just a TV
[41:22.880 --> 41:24.120]  show. And sometimes
[41:25.100 --> 41:26.300]  we didn't need
[41:26.300 --> 41:28.560]  the alternate reality game that nobody
[41:28.560 --> 41:30.320]  really cared about to put
[41:30.320 --> 41:32.760]  all these pieces together to solve
[41:32.760 --> 41:34.700]  a mystery that nobody wants for a show that's
[41:34.700 --> 41:36.720]  canceled in season two. But how
[41:36.720 --> 41:38.520]  would characters, how would a movie
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.680]  exist without lore? No, no, no.
[41:40.680 --> 41:42.700]  I'm not talking about the
[41:42.700 --> 41:44.600]  what you're seeing on
[41:44.600 --> 41:46.640]  screen. I'm talking about what happens
[41:46.640 --> 41:48.620]  when everyone extrapolates every little
[41:48.620 --> 41:50.800]  detail in becoming the
[41:50.800 --> 41:52.640]  most lore-focused thing where
[41:52.640 --> 41:54.980]  I guess my example is like
[41:54.980 --> 41:56.560]  how come the timeline
[41:56.560 --> 41:58.680]  for Donkey Kong doesn't make
[41:58.680 --> 42:00.740]  sense? We don't need
[42:00.740 --> 42:02.480]  a timeline for Donkey Kong.
[42:02.900 --> 42:04.320]  He's Donkey Kong.
[42:04.680 --> 42:06.720]  He is the monkey and he
[42:06.720 --> 42:08.780]  wants the banana. So it's more
[42:08.780 --> 42:10.620]  of like a consumer thing then.
[42:10.660 --> 42:11.840]  It's like the fans. Yes.
[42:12.460 --> 42:14.160]  Because I don't think Nintendo
[42:14.660 --> 42:16.320]  are that strict with their lore.
[42:16.460 --> 42:17.060]  Look at Zelda.
[42:18.560 --> 42:20.460]  And everyone is pissed. Not
[42:20.460 --> 42:22.500]  everyone, but weird nerds
[42:22.500 --> 42:24.600]  are pissed about where does this fit
[42:24.600 --> 42:26.120]  in the timeline? Who
[42:26.740 --> 42:28.700]  gives a shit? It does not matter.
[42:28.920 --> 42:30.440]  Basically, if someone's there asking
[42:30.440 --> 42:32.200]  what order are the Zelda games in?
[42:32.400 --> 42:34.620]  Is this the same link from this game as it is in that game?
[42:34.620 --> 42:36.840]  Your answer is shut up. Shut up.
[42:36.840 --> 42:38.860]  Shut up. It does not
[42:38.860 --> 42:41.020]  matter. Play the game. I hope you enjoy
[42:41.020 --> 42:42.980]  the game. If there's stuff there
[42:42.980 --> 42:44.740]  and people want to, if the
[42:44.740 --> 42:46.960]  creator is like, hey, I developed it with this
[42:46.960 --> 42:48.340]  stuff in mind or whatever,
[42:48.760 --> 42:49.980]  great. Whatever.
[42:50.500 --> 42:52.740]  When people start going like, well, here's how
[42:52.740 --> 42:54.800]  it fits in with the Star Wars.
[42:54.940 --> 42:56.780]  Star Wars is, I guess, the big
[42:56.780 --> 42:58.160]  example. Because when I was a kid,
[42:58.720 --> 43:00.460]  it was all of the books
[43:00.460 --> 43:02.340]  and everything of the
[43:02.340 --> 43:04.300]  Star Wars extended universe.
[43:04.300 --> 43:06.200]  You read these books and all this stuff.
[43:06.380 --> 43:07.760]  And then they just went, none of that's real.
[43:08.160 --> 43:09.380]  None of that's canon, actually.
[43:10.220 --> 43:12.260]  But I read all these books and I really
[43:12.260 --> 43:14.120]  enjoyed them. And they go, yeah, none of that
[43:14.120 --> 43:16.140]  fucking means anything here, so fuck you.
[43:16.300 --> 43:17.400]  And it was like, oh, okay, sick.
[43:17.980 --> 43:20.220]  I guess it doesn't matter. And that's really
[43:20.220 --> 43:21.940]  what was my turning point on
[43:21.940 --> 43:24.240]  not everything that you like has
[43:24.240 --> 43:26.340]  to become the biggest volume
[43:27.080 --> 43:28.220]  encyclopedia. It can just
[43:28.220 --> 43:30.140]  be a thing you enjoy for a little while and then you
[43:30.140 --> 43:31.800]  can put it away and move on.
[43:31.800 --> 43:33.620]  And you don't have to know what the timeline
[43:33.620 --> 43:35.920]  for Donkey Kong is. It can just be
[43:36.460 --> 43:37.940]  Donkey Kong. And that's
[43:37.940 --> 43:38.660]  fine.
[43:40.700 --> 43:41.960]  People trying to figure out
[43:41.960 --> 43:43.860]  the Mario Brothers timeline is
[43:43.860 --> 43:45.380]  the craziest thing in the world to me.
[43:45.640 --> 43:47.740]  Mario Brothers? You go right. You just
[43:47.740 --> 43:49.760]  go right. And now you can go forward and backward.
[43:50.340 --> 43:51.860]  You pull back on the stick, maybe
[43:51.860 --> 43:53.820]  you go forward. I don't know. Nix controls are working.
[43:54.720 --> 43:55.800]  But I just
[43:55.800 --> 43:57.560]  think the lore focus
[43:57.560 --> 43:59.680]  of stuff is really, really frustrating to me.
[43:59.680 --> 44:01.200]  And I'm sick of it. I'm done with it.
[44:01.300 --> 44:03.480]  Now, to be clear, you're not opposed to all lore. You just
[44:03.480 --> 44:04.940]  don't think everything needs it.
[44:05.280 --> 44:07.660]  Yes, and I don't think that fans need to
[44:07.660 --> 44:09.500]  deep dive on every detail of
[44:09.500 --> 44:11.500]  everything like Donkey Kong
[44:11.500 --> 44:13.340]  timelines. That is.
[44:13.600 --> 44:15.100]  I love lore. I think sometimes
[44:15.620 --> 44:16.900]  stupidity of lore is
[44:17.440 --> 44:19.560]  sometimes my favorite thing about the thing.
[44:19.900 --> 44:20.940]  Like, I love,
[44:21.340 --> 44:23.620]  I truly love in Fast and Furious
[44:23.620 --> 44:25.360]  how fucked up that lore is
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.720]  because they tried to make something make sense
[44:27.720 --> 44:29.680]  and then they decided it didn't matter
[44:29.680 --> 44:31.660]  anyway after doing all of the work
[44:31.660 --> 44:33.560]  to explain it where they had a very
[44:33.560 --> 44:35.560]  popular character die
[44:35.560 --> 44:37.720]  in Tokyo Drift, which was the third
[44:37.720 --> 44:39.600]  film. And then in like movie
[44:39.600 --> 44:41.640]  five, they're like, fuck, we want to bring him back.
[44:41.640 --> 44:43.560]  But he's dead. How do we do that? Okay,
[44:43.720 --> 44:46.000]  we'll set five, six
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.700]  and seven before
[44:48.160 --> 44:49.840]  three. We'll do that
[44:49.840 --> 44:51.660]  like, well, this timeline is all
[44:51.660 --> 44:53.620]  fucked now because we want to explain how
[44:53.620 --> 44:55.320]  Han can be around
[44:55.320 --> 44:57.360]  and then they do all that. And
[44:57.360 --> 44:59.380]  then we get to the point of his death. And
[44:59.380 --> 45:01.100]  then they just bring him back anyway.
[45:01.200 --> 45:03.360]  And the most recent installment, and
[45:03.360 --> 45:05.320]  it was like, well, why did you need to
[45:05.320 --> 45:07.340]  do any of that work? Like none of it actually
[45:07.340 --> 45:09.340]  mattered. He was just coming back regardless
[45:09.340 --> 45:11.420]  of what you did. Yeah, none of
[45:11.420 --> 45:13.320]  it matters. But I love that
[45:13.320 --> 45:15.400]  they tried so hard to explain
[45:15.400 --> 45:17.200]  it in a way, maybe the
[45:17.200 --> 45:19.340]  only attempt to like logically explain
[45:19.340 --> 45:21.120]  anything in any of those movies.
[45:21.340 --> 45:23.120]  And it's just crazy that they did it.
[45:23.120 --> 45:25.360]  So I love personally lore.
[45:27.420 --> 45:29.180]  The fan feedback
[45:29.180 --> 45:31.000]  around it can definitely be annoying at times.
[45:31.120 --> 45:32.740]  I think I like it because
[45:33.460 --> 45:35.320]  I grew up in a time
[45:35.320 --> 45:37.300]  where video games didn't look
[45:37.300 --> 45:38.460]  anything like the cover.
[45:39.160 --> 45:41.240]  And you have like pixels for
[45:41.240 --> 45:42.880]  like an enemy. And I would always be like,
[45:43.300 --> 45:45.180]  oh, I'm going to read the booklet and see what this enemy
[45:45.180 --> 45:47.000]  actually looks like. And I want to learn
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.120]  about it and why it's doing what it's doing.
[45:50.340 --> 45:51.360]  So that's interesting.
[45:51.360 --> 45:53.580]  And when
[45:53.580 --> 45:55.540]  I was younger, I felt the same way
[45:55.540 --> 45:57.420]  because we didn't have it. It was
[45:57.420 --> 45:59.020]  a thing that I was desperate for.
[45:59.340 --> 46:00.880]  I wanted more lore and what if
[46:00.880 --> 46:03.240]  all these things connected? And now
[46:03.880 --> 46:05.460]  everything's a franchise. Everything
[46:05.460 --> 46:07.460]  connects. Nothing can be just on
[46:07.460 --> 46:09.520]  its own. Everything has to be, well,
[46:09.780 --> 46:11.600]  how does this make sense with the lore?
[46:11.780 --> 46:13.000]  And it's like, this sucks.
[46:13.440 --> 46:15.460]  I don't want it to go back to the
[46:15.460 --> 46:17.440]  amount that it was before where it was zero.
[46:17.660 --> 46:19.520]  But it cannot continue to be
[46:19.520 --> 46:21.340]  the amount that it is, which is
[46:21.860 --> 46:23.600]  100. It's too much.
[46:23.720 --> 46:25.640]  It's too much lore for every single thing.
[46:26.220 --> 46:26.560]  Fair play.
[46:27.280 --> 46:29.520]  I think that's fair. As long as we're okay with lore existing,
[46:29.640 --> 46:31.300]  I'm with you. Oh, yeah. I'm fine with
[46:31.300 --> 46:33.440]  existing. I'm not fine with
[46:33.440 --> 46:35.380]  people being mad about
[46:35.380 --> 46:37.500]  Donkey Kong timeline. I'm never going to let
[46:37.500 --> 46:39.460]  that go. Donkey Kong timeline is like
[46:39.460 --> 46:41.360]  the craziest thing in the world to me. You care about
[46:41.360 --> 46:43.660]  when the Donkey Kong games take place? Donkey Kong?
[46:44.600 --> 46:45.400]  Donkey Kong?
[46:45.700 --> 46:47.460]  Goddamn. It makes me nuts. That's
[46:47.460 --> 46:49.520]  crazy. So what is
[46:49.520 --> 46:51.400]  that lore? Is Cranky Kong the
[46:51.400 --> 46:53.800]  original Donkey Kong? Right, but that's
[46:53.800 --> 46:55.460]  what people posited. Like, oh,
[46:55.460 --> 46:57.360]  yeah, the original Donkey Kong is Cranky Kong, but then
[46:57.360 --> 46:59.460]  this new game is coming out and Cranky Kong
[46:59.460 --> 47:01.440]  is in it, and people are like, how can there be
[47:01.440 --> 47:03.440]  Kid Pauline, but Cranky Kong?
[47:03.620 --> 47:05.480]  Like, there's people getting mad about
[47:05.480 --> 47:06.960]  that stuff, and you just go, I don't
[47:07.480 --> 47:09.580]  know, man. Who cares? I don't know. Is anyone
[47:09.580 --> 47:11.580]  wondering where Lanky Kong is these days?
[47:11.940 --> 47:13.360]  I don't think anybody
[47:14.540 --> 47:15.500]  wants that. He's got
[47:15.500 --> 47:17.680]  He has no style. He has no grace.
[47:18.220 --> 47:19.700]  Is Lanky Kong the Taylor
[47:19.700 --> 47:21.760]  Kitsch of the Donkey Kong
[47:21.760 --> 47:23.620]  universe? Absolutely. None of it is
[47:23.620 --> 47:25.760]  his fault. Yeah, Donkey is Aaron
[47:25.760 --> 47:26.500]  Taylor Johnson.
[47:31.360 --> 47:33.520]  That's my take. Thank you very much.
[47:34.380 --> 47:35.800]  Gavin, so excited.
[47:36.040 --> 47:37.100]  Go for it. Oh, I can't wait.
[47:40.400 --> 47:41.440]  Every time
[47:41.440 --> 47:43.360]  the CEO of a major
[47:44.220 --> 47:45.180]  global corporation
[47:45.180 --> 47:47.580]  takes a bonus, he first
[47:47.580 --> 47:49.420]  has to stand in front
[47:49.420 --> 47:51.160]  of each employee one by one
[47:51.160 --> 47:53.620]  and tell them what his bonus is about to be
[47:53.620 --> 47:55.520]  and tell them how long
[47:55.520 --> 47:56.940]  it would take that employee
[47:56.940 --> 47:59.160]  to earn the same amount of money
[47:59.880 --> 48:01.480]  on their current salary.
[48:02.720 --> 48:03.540]  Just to see
[48:03.540 --> 48:05.360]  if after going through all that, he still wants
[48:05.360 --> 48:07.100]  to take the bonus. I love it.
[48:07.440 --> 48:09.460]  I think it can't be over
[48:09.460 --> 48:11.640]  a Zoom call or anything. It has to be
[48:11.640 --> 48:13.340]  in the same room, direct face-to-face.
[48:13.800 --> 48:15.300]  So he'll be like, hi,
[48:16.260 --> 48:17.260]  Edwin Jenkins.
[48:17.740 --> 48:19.560]  My bonus this year
[48:19.560 --> 48:21.500]  is $25 million
[48:21.500 --> 48:23.100]  and at your current salary
[48:23.580 --> 48:25.720]  would take you 175 years
[48:25.720 --> 48:27.920]  to earn. Good to see you.
[48:28.280 --> 48:29.400]  And just to see if
[48:29.400 --> 48:31.740]  being overloaded with that
[48:31.740 --> 48:33.560]  would cause any
[48:33.560 --> 48:35.620]  kind of guilt. I don't think
[48:35.620 --> 48:37.260]  it would, unfortunately.
[48:37.920 --> 48:39.720]  I think a lot of the people
[48:39.720 --> 48:41.780]  in these positions are kind of psychotic.
[48:43.220 --> 48:45.160]  Or just void of emotion.
[48:46.060 --> 48:47.760]  I really like this idea.
[48:47.900 --> 48:49.140]  I would almost like to see
[48:49.720 --> 48:51.840]  a scenario in which they have to pitch
[48:51.840 --> 48:53.160]  why they deserve their bonus
[48:53.720 --> 48:55.520]  and then it's Squid Game style
[48:55.520 --> 48:57.540]  where every employee has to vote
[48:57.540 --> 48:59.460]  by hitting a yes or no button
[48:59.460 --> 49:01.560]  whether they receive it or not.
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.660]  I like that.
[49:03.800 --> 49:05.140]  What if it's like a mixed vote?
[49:05.560 --> 49:06.780]  Whatever's the majority wins.
[49:07.820 --> 49:08.860]  They would never
[49:08.860 --> 49:09.380]  get a bonus.
[49:11.320 --> 49:12.900]  That's why you have to state your case
[49:12.900 --> 49:13.460]  really well.
[49:14.520 --> 49:16.960]  Can you imagine any corporation
[49:16.960 --> 49:17.520]  on the planet
[49:18.780 --> 49:19.660]  I think
[49:19.660 --> 49:22.540]  they wouldn't even get 10%,
[49:22.540 --> 49:24.180]  let alone 100%.
[49:24.180 --> 49:26.520]  I think that's totally fine.
[49:26.840 --> 49:28.120]  Make a stronger case.
[49:28.360 --> 49:30.160]  If you're really that good and that much of a leader,
[49:30.320 --> 49:32.440]  you can make your case to these people that you deserve more.
[49:32.800 --> 49:34.740]  I can imagine a CEO walking up
[49:34.740 --> 49:36.720]  and being like, listen y'all, I know I'm not going to get my bonus
[49:36.720 --> 49:38.400]  this year, so I just want to take this time
[49:38.400 --> 49:40.780]  to talk about the fact that we are
[49:40.780 --> 49:42.380]  not smuggling enough things anally.
[49:42.840 --> 49:43.800]  Let's get into this.
[49:44.160 --> 49:45.460]  This could be the future.
[49:46.920 --> 49:48.600]  I like this take
[49:48.600 --> 49:50.880]  just because I want to see a CEO have to do that.
[49:51.140 --> 49:52.800]  I just wonder if how many
[49:52.800 --> 49:54.940]  CEOs at the end of that experience
[49:54.940 --> 49:56.780]  would actually think twice about it
[49:56.780 --> 49:58.780]  or whether they'd just be like, and that's done with
[49:58.780 --> 49:59.320]  for another year.
[49:59.860 --> 50:00.940]  I think it's that.
[50:00.940 --> 50:03.480]  I think so too.
[50:03.740 --> 50:05.060]  What part of you is going
[50:05.060 --> 50:07.120]  and David Zasloff changed
[50:07.120 --> 50:07.640]  his mind?
[50:08.500 --> 50:11.000]  I'm also so interested
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.940]  to see what his compelling case is
[50:12.940 --> 50:15.120]  about why he deserves the bonus.
[50:15.980 --> 50:17.340]  He changed his mind.
[50:17.660 --> 50:18.600]  They're splintering now.
[50:18.760 --> 50:20.760]  It's just like, oh man,
[50:20.840 --> 50:22.920]  I would love to still be
[50:22.920 --> 50:24.880]  an employee for that meeting. That would be
[50:24.880 --> 50:26.780]  phenomenal. Think about how many subsidiaries
[50:26.780 --> 50:29.040]  some of these companies have. They would have to come
[50:29.040 --> 50:31.020]  to our company, sit down
[50:31.020 --> 50:32.980]  with us, and meet with Drew Saplin
[50:32.980 --> 50:35.120]  and every other person
[50:36.540 --> 50:37.180]  to make
[50:37.180 --> 50:39.060]  the case about, all right, and here's how long you'd have
[50:39.060 --> 50:39.600]  to work.
[50:41.160 --> 50:42.500]  Here's what's going to happen eventually.
[50:42.700 --> 50:44.460]  On these big companies, potentially
[50:44.460 --> 50:46.880]  the employee will be like, asking
[50:46.880 --> 50:48.540]  the CEO, well, what have you actually done
[50:48.540 --> 50:50.700]  this year? What's the kind of work you've done?
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  He'll just be like, mainly standing
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.720]  in front of all my employees, telling them
[50:54.720 --> 50:56.160]  what my bonus is going to be.
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.420]  Because it would take so freaking long.
[50:58.720 --> 51:00.100]  Yep. I had the
[51:00.100 --> 51:02.140]  courage to rename the thing
[51:02.140 --> 51:04.080]  what it was originally called, because I just
[51:04.080 --> 51:04.960]  had that vision.
[51:05.560 --> 51:06.840]  You're welcome.
[51:08.160 --> 51:10.020]  And you're welcome. Oh man,
[51:10.020 --> 51:11.500]  that's a good take. I like that.
[51:11.660 --> 51:13.900]  That's a fantastic take.
[51:13.940 --> 51:15.480]  I like that a lot. Yep. Sweet.
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.940]  Okay, Nick, round us out. What
[51:17.940 --> 51:19.500]  is your take?
[51:19.880 --> 51:21.900]  I keep getting to follow Gavin on
[51:21.900 --> 51:24.000]  some pretty big, crucial
[51:24.000 --> 51:25.960]  takes, and then I get to
[51:26.900 --> 51:28.060]  dive bomb a little
[51:28.060 --> 51:29.580]  bit. So this one,
[51:29.940 --> 51:31.340]  I think a lot of people
[51:31.960 --> 51:34.080]  try to say that you should never put
[51:34.080 --> 51:35.280]  ketchup on a hot dog, right?
[51:36.420 --> 51:38.080]  Sure. That's a thing that, I
[51:38.080 --> 51:39.660]  don't know if you grew up with it, but
[51:39.660 --> 51:42.160]  all the people I knew were like, you should never put ketchup on a hot dog.
[51:42.260 --> 51:44.140]  No problem with ketchup
[51:45.520 --> 51:46.260]  on a hot
[51:46.260 --> 51:48.060]  dog with something else. My
[51:48.060 --> 51:49.680]  take. You mean ketchup, right?
[51:50.040 --> 51:51.800]  You're saying ketchup, but you mean ketchup.
[51:53.400 --> 51:54.200]  Katsup? Katsup?
[51:54.560 --> 51:55.620]  Ketchup. Yeah, ketchup.
[51:55.960 --> 51:57.140]  Whatever. Thank you, Gavin.
[51:57.460 --> 51:59.560]  Thank you, Gavin.
[51:59.920 --> 52:01.520]  Okay. I also say
[52:01.520 --> 52:03.400]  helicopter, hillicopter most of the time.
[52:04.040 --> 52:05.640]  I never noticed that one.
[52:05.840 --> 52:06.700]  Me neither. Now I will.
[52:07.360 --> 52:09.560]  Glad to hear it. If you push forward on a
[52:09.560 --> 52:11.240]  helicopter, which direction does it go?
[52:12.340 --> 52:13.800]  Well, is it attached
[52:13.800 --> 52:14.600]  to a neck or not?
[52:17.000 --> 52:17.740]  It depends.
[52:17.880 --> 52:19.060]  Are the controls inverted or not?
[52:19.060 --> 52:20.400]  Alright, go ahead.
[52:21.440 --> 52:23.020]  Damn it. Are they inverted?
[52:23.740 --> 52:25.080]  My argument is
[52:25.080 --> 52:27.020]  that ketchup should never be
[52:27.020 --> 52:28.960]  alone on a hot dog.
[52:29.480 --> 52:31.140]  Oh. Ketchup has no
[52:31.140 --> 52:32.900]  place being the sole
[52:32.900 --> 52:35.000]  condiment on a hot dog because
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.080]  it's too sweet and takes away from the
[52:37.080 --> 52:39.120]  rest of the dog
[52:39.120 --> 52:41.260]  itself. If it's ketchup and mustard,
[52:41.760 --> 52:43.300]  you've got that nice bit
[52:43.300 --> 52:45.020]  of comparison. More
[52:45.020 --> 52:46.720]  the acidity of the
[52:46.720 --> 52:48.480]  mustard going with the ketchup
[52:48.480 --> 52:50.580]  sweetness and that compliments the dog pretty
[52:50.580 --> 52:52.560]  well, right? With a relish, it's pretty good.
[52:52.600 --> 52:54.340]  With onion, it's cutting through a little bit.
[52:54.400 --> 52:55.900]  Even if you had chili.
[52:56.520 --> 52:58.820]  My argument is ketchup alone
[52:58.820 --> 53:00.000]  on a hot dog, gross.
[53:00.300 --> 53:01.940]  With other stuff, good.
[53:02.920 --> 53:04.700]  I wonder if you're going to lose this
[53:04.700 --> 53:06.440]  poll just because of the ketchup thing.
[53:06.780 --> 53:08.620]  In the same way that people get
[53:08.620 --> 53:10.700]  so upset when people call Mario Mario
[53:10.700 --> 53:12.820]  because that's
[53:12.820 --> 53:14.620]  how they pronounce that there.
[53:14.620 --> 53:16.660]  I'm so fascinated to see the
[53:16.660 --> 53:18.360]  ketchup reaction. I also feel like
[53:18.360 --> 53:20.160]  never before have you said
[53:20.160 --> 53:22.320]  ketchup so much like catch.
[53:23.160 --> 53:24.760]  I felt like even after
[53:24.760 --> 53:26.740]  calling it out, you went even harder on it
[53:26.740 --> 53:28.600]  somehow. Like some of them, you were just saying
[53:28.600 --> 53:30.060]  catch. Ketchup?
[53:30.580 --> 53:32.300]  Is it ketchup? It's ketchup? Okay.
[53:32.560 --> 53:34.200]  Ketchup. Okay, so
[53:35.480 --> 53:36.660]  in the event of
[53:36.660 --> 53:38.400]  no condiment at all or just
[53:38.400 --> 53:40.440]  plain hot dog, it's plain hot dog for you?
[53:40.720 --> 53:42.640]  Is that the...
[53:42.640 --> 53:44.260]  In the event of no condiment at all or
[53:44.260 --> 53:46.140]  plain hot dog. So if you're going to get a hot dog
[53:46.140 --> 53:48.240]  and the only thing they have is ketchup, that means you're just
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.360]  going to have that plain dog.
[53:51.140 --> 53:52.560]  I'll take a dry dog
[53:52.560 --> 53:54.280]  over a ketchup dog. Would you allow
[53:54.280 --> 53:56.160]  some solo mustard though? Yeah.
[53:56.280 --> 53:58.220]  That's totally acceptable. Mustard is
[53:58.220 --> 54:00.040]  a very complimentary flavor to the hot dog.
[54:00.500 --> 54:01.900]  How do you feel about ketchup generally?
[54:02.480 --> 54:03.980]  I love it. It's good on fries.
[54:04.300 --> 54:05.660]  It works well with a burger.
[54:06.380 --> 54:07.900]  Ketchup, mustard, good stuff.
[54:09.060 --> 54:10.220]  But on its own,
[54:10.220 --> 54:12.560]  on a dog, just a weird flavor profile.
[54:12.780 --> 54:14.520]  Don't like it? Shouldn't allow it.
[54:14.980 --> 54:16.280]  Wow. I've
[54:16.280 --> 54:17.820]  never... Wow.
[54:18.660 --> 54:20.320]  And you think it's so bad that people
[54:20.320 --> 54:21.780]  shouldn't be allowed to do it?
[54:22.120 --> 54:23.960]  Just generally? Should just be outlawed?
[54:24.260 --> 54:25.460]  Should be a banned combination?
[54:26.100 --> 54:28.380]  Well, I hadn't thought of it that way until you mentioned it,
[54:28.400 --> 54:30.260]  but yeah. Fuck them.
[54:30.980 --> 54:31.100]  What?
[54:33.640 --> 54:34.080]  Oh.
[54:34.180 --> 54:36.120]  I'm a ketchup only
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.020]  dog guy, so I'm going to have to completely... Are you really?
[54:38.540 --> 54:39.760]  Yeah. Oh, wow.
[54:39.980 --> 54:41.840]  Absolutely I am. So sorry to hear that.
[54:42.260 --> 54:44.380]  Yeah, I guess I'm going to have to change how I do it.
[54:44.640 --> 54:46.040]  I think it's so inoffensive.
[54:46.220 --> 54:47.640]  And I think the benefits of ketchup
[54:48.300 --> 54:49.620]  compared with a plain dog
[54:50.740 --> 54:52.180]  is absolutely astronomical.
[54:52.420 --> 54:54.180]  I would always go for the ketchup over nothing.
[54:54.600 --> 54:56.140]  And I'm not even a big ketchup guy.
[54:56.780 --> 54:57.220]  Hey, Nick.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.100]  I'm going to go with you. Why not?
[55:00.440 --> 55:00.800]  Yay!
[55:01.820 --> 55:02.940]  Surely you don't believe that.
[55:03.300 --> 55:05.120]  No, I don't, but I got it.
[55:05.120 --> 55:06.400]  Somebody's got to be on his side here.
[55:06.600 --> 55:07.900]  No, they don't.
[55:08.280 --> 55:10.260]  I don't want non-believers on my team.
[55:10.420 --> 55:12.080]  I don't want non-believers.
[55:12.080 --> 55:13.700]  He doesn't want your charity support.
[55:14.420 --> 55:16.100]  Someone's got to help this guy.
[55:16.380 --> 55:17.580]  He's hanging by a thread here.
[55:18.140 --> 55:21.400]  He's telling people they're not allowed to have ketchup.
[55:21.400 --> 55:23.420]  Look, Archie will learn both things.
[55:24.040 --> 55:25.420]  No ketchup on dog alone.
[55:25.660 --> 55:27.520]  Oh, is this something that he does right now?
[55:28.100 --> 55:29.100]  No, he doesn't fucking eat
[55:29.680 --> 55:30.160]  condiments.
[55:30.880 --> 55:31.420]  That little...
[55:32.320 --> 55:34.160]  What are you about to say?
[55:34.520 --> 55:36.680]  That little non-sauce monkey.
[55:39.220 --> 55:41.340]  He is the opposite of that character.
[55:41.600 --> 55:43.800]  The sauce guy banning sauces.
[55:44.200 --> 55:44.680]  That's crazy.
[55:45.360 --> 55:47.860]  It's not just banning the sauce.
[55:47.980 --> 55:49.860]  It's in lieu of you need more sauces.
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.520]  I can't just be the single sauce.
[55:51.680 --> 55:53.700]  I think a hot dog might be the most
[55:53.700 --> 55:56.240]  in need of condiment food that exists.
[55:56.840 --> 55:57.780]  Yeah, I don't disagree.
[55:58.200 --> 55:59.260]  I would have a dry chip.
[55:59.260 --> 56:01.640]  So he's telling you put a bunch of condiments
[56:01.640 --> 56:02.300]  on that sucker.
[56:02.600 --> 56:03.560]  Yeah, together.
[56:04.140 --> 56:07.060]  There's a certain point where when I'm putting condiments on a dog
[56:07.060 --> 56:09.740]  I feel like the effort is more than what it's worth.
[56:09.980 --> 56:11.160]  I don't want to have to open
[56:11.160 --> 56:13.400]  three different bottles for my hot dog.
[56:14.340 --> 56:15.120]  It's too much.
[56:15.140 --> 56:17.280]  If you had one bottle with three nozzles
[56:17.280 --> 56:19.180]  and it was just a singular squeeze
[56:19.180 --> 56:20.700]  for all the condiments.
[56:21.240 --> 56:23.080]  Somebody get uniform on the phone.
[56:25.600 --> 56:27.880]  The relish hole would have to be quite big.
[56:28.380 --> 56:30.440]  Didn't they do that with a peanut butter and jelly
[56:30.440 --> 56:31.080]  back in the day?
[56:31.800 --> 56:33.660]  You could get little jars of the same shit.
[56:34.500 --> 56:35.860]  Like all that goober
[56:35.860 --> 56:37.200]  gross looking goob shit.
[56:37.320 --> 56:39.160]  It was called goober.
[56:39.580 --> 56:40.480]  It was like striped.
[56:40.760 --> 56:43.060]  I saw that in stores
[56:43.060 --> 56:44.960]  the first time I came to America.
[56:46.020 --> 56:47.560]  What the hell is wrong with this place?
[56:48.460 --> 56:49.880]  Is it illegal to have it in
[56:49.880 --> 56:51.620]  England or is it just frowned upon
[56:51.620 --> 56:53.260]  so you have to put it in your ass to get it there?
[56:56.300 --> 56:57.340]  British customs
[56:57.340 --> 56:59.460]  looking for
[56:59.460 --> 57:00.380]  looking for goober
[57:00.380 --> 57:01.360]  and mines in my ass
[57:01.360 --> 57:02.800]  and they can't do anything about it.
[57:03.460 --> 57:05.160]  We know he has goober
[57:05.160 --> 57:06.920]  and we know his jelly ratings
[57:06.920 --> 57:08.480]  are off the chart on this
[57:09.060 --> 57:10.580]  this goddamn goober.
[57:11.940 --> 57:13.140]  Doing a ten hour flight
[57:13.140 --> 57:14.800]  with an ass load of goober would be
[57:14.800 --> 57:15.880]  an absolute nightmare.
[57:16.760 --> 57:18.360]  You hear the jar crack?
[57:18.720 --> 57:19.340]  Oh no.
[57:19.340 --> 57:21.260]  Oh man.
[57:21.460 --> 57:22.420]  That'd be terrible.
[57:23.480 --> 57:25.540]  What a bunch of interesting takes.
[57:25.780 --> 57:27.660]  Really, really interesting takes.
[57:27.840 --> 57:29.140]  I mean this show was created
[57:29.140 --> 57:31.740]  so that way Taylor Kitsch could have something to do
[57:31.740 --> 57:33.460]  but it really took us
[57:33.460 --> 57:34.560]  down some rabbit holes.
[57:35.760 --> 57:37.280]  Very, very interesting.
[57:38.600 --> 57:39.540]  I'm so excited
[57:39.540 --> 57:41.400]  to see how the audience feels
[57:41.400 --> 57:42.440]  about these takes.
[57:42.740 --> 57:45.640]  I'm interested in the audience opinion on the poll.
[57:45.760 --> 57:47.340]  I'm interested in the audience takes.
[57:47.340 --> 57:49.340]  I'm interested in if they want us to do another
[57:49.340 --> 57:51.460]  round of takes, Jeff's takes included.
[57:51.880 --> 57:53.680]  Jeff would have great takes.
[57:54.020 --> 57:54.180]  Yeah.
[57:54.920 --> 57:57.240]  It's not going to be inverted versus
[57:57.240 --> 57:59.420]  verted but it will be something so I'm very curious.
[58:00.320 --> 58:01.320]  Maybe he's a
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.720]  secret inverter.
[58:03.740 --> 58:04.740]  A secret inverter?
[58:05.300 --> 58:05.780]  He's not.
[58:06.280 --> 58:08.740]  I feel like my
[58:09.740 --> 58:11.180]  first take was so
[58:11.780 --> 58:13.200]  wild and useless yet
[58:13.200 --> 58:15.300]  somehow I still agree with it more than
[58:15.300 --> 58:16.580]  both of Nick's picks.
[58:19.840 --> 58:21.360]  Well, incredible.
[58:21.540 --> 58:23.260]  What's it like to be wrong?
[58:23.520 --> 58:24.040]  I'm wrong a lot.
[58:24.520 --> 58:25.780]  Maybe he's right.
[58:25.900 --> 58:28.700]  No confidence in asking
[58:28.700 --> 58:31.300]  how does it feel?
[58:33.820 --> 58:35.120]  Anyway, vote in the poll.
[58:35.120 --> 58:35.960]  Was that the end of the sentence?
[58:36.260 --> 58:39.480]  Vote in the poll. Make sure to check out
[58:39.480 --> 58:41.460]  our Patreon at the Regulation Pod.

[58:43.340 --> 58:44.840]  I can't wait to see what happens.
[58:45.200 --> 58:46.360]  They're voting for
[58:47.120 --> 58:49.000]  the worst take? Is that what it is?
[58:49.080 --> 58:51.300]  They're voting for the worst take to see who
[58:51.300 --> 58:53.560]  will have to hang the idiot flag
[58:53.560 --> 58:55.080]  on themselves.
[58:55.540 --> 58:56.220]  Pretty exciting.
[58:56.540 --> 58:58.360]  Pretty cool.
[58:58.720 --> 59:00.420]  Thanks for listening.
[59:01.680 --> 59:03.280]  Let us know your takes in the comments.
[59:03.540 --> 59:04.160]  Maybe that helps.
[59:05.380 --> 59:06.800]  We'll see you next time. Bye!
[59:07.140 --> 59:07.340]  Bye!
