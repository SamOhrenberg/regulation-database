[00:14.520 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,

[00:31.480 --> 00:34.880]  This episode is brought to you by Diet Coke. You know that moment when you just need to
[00:34.880 --> 00:39.840]  hit pause and refresh? An ice-cold Diet Coke isn't just a break. It's your chance to catch
[00:39.840 --> 00:44.900]  your breath and savor a moment that's all about you. Always refreshing, still the same great taste.
[00:45.300 --> 00:47.200]  Diet Coke. Make time for you time.
[00:49.100 --> 00:55.440]  Hello, and welcome to another regulation draft. Today, we are going to be determining
[00:55.440 --> 01:02.900]  the 20 greatest robots of all time, at least as I understand it. This is a Gavin idea,
[01:03.060 --> 01:05.780]  so correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what we're doing today, right?
[01:06.620 --> 01:10.840]  Yeah, he was very adamant that we do it first also, so yeah, this all feels like Gavin.
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.060]  I will correct you.
[01:12.320 --> 01:12.860]  Oh, what?
[01:12.940 --> 01:14.260]  Okay, you are wrong.
[01:14.820 --> 01:16.140]  What am I wrong about?
[01:16.420 --> 01:16.560]  Huh?
[01:16.560 --> 01:17.920]  Just about robots.
[01:19.900 --> 01:20.340]  Okay.
[01:22.260 --> 01:28.320]  This would be where you'd expound upon that if you would like the fucking draft to continue.
[01:28.320 --> 01:32.240]  Are you joking, dude? Like, say the rest of your words.
[01:32.660 --> 01:35.960]  Oh, you said correct me if I'm wrong, if it's Gavin's idea, and I said you were wrong.
[01:36.760 --> 01:37.740]  All right, so what's the correction?
[01:38.080 --> 01:38.940]  I don't know whose idea it is.
[01:39.240 --> 01:40.280]  Okay, this sucks.
[01:41.820 --> 01:45.880]  All right, we're doing a Gavin idea today. It's robot draft.
[01:47.580 --> 01:51.560]  He just came in and said point of order and then sat there.
[01:54.440 --> 01:57.240]  Gavin's at the point where he's just saying words he's heard other people say.
[01:57.420 --> 02:01.540]  Okay, doesn't understand the context behind them or what they're meant to do.
[02:02.340 --> 02:07.540]  How many times are we gonna randomize before we determine who goes first?
[02:07.880 --> 02:08.540]  Five as in robot.
[02:09.140 --> 02:10.300]  There we go. I'm fine with that.
[02:10.440 --> 02:10.660]  There you go.
[02:10.680 --> 02:11.440]  All right, excellent.
[02:11.620 --> 02:12.340]  Five it is.
[02:12.340 --> 02:17.060]  As always, we're using Sean Bear's website, the regulation draft...
[02:22.220 --> 02:27.320]  The regulation draft generator, which you can use as well if you want to do drafts with your
[02:27.320 --> 02:29.840]  friends. We're going to randomize five times. Here we go.
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.280]  Rolls off the tongue.
[02:31.320 --> 02:35.300]  One, two, stop, three, I'm almost done, four. Here's four. This is where it would stand if
[02:35.300 --> 02:39.140]  it was four. Eric, Nick, Gavin, Andrew, Jeff. And remember, this is a snake draft,
[02:39.660 --> 02:41.180]  so five will go twice in a row.
[02:41.180 --> 02:45.240]  Here we go. We are going Gavin, Nick, Andrew, Eric, Jeff.
[02:48.540 --> 02:50.460]  I'm on an end for once.
[02:50.760 --> 02:53.180]  Yeah, it's always funny when you're in the middle.
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.500]  No, it's not.
[02:57.140 --> 02:58.020]  Point of order.
[02:58.740 --> 02:59.240]  No, it's not.
[03:01.260 --> 03:01.700]  Overruled.
[03:03.240 --> 03:07.620]  Well, this was Gavin's idea. He really wanted to do robots first. So guess what? He gets the
[03:07.620 --> 03:15.100]  first pick. Gavin, what's your number one with a bullet pick? A number one best robot ever.
[03:15.740 --> 03:20.340]  Oh, you know what I like? I like robots from back in the day when they used to be called robots.
[03:20.700 --> 03:27.120]  And I think the best example of that is the little robot from the Twilight Zone.
[03:27.600 --> 03:30.140]  Oh, was there a time when they were called robots?
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.660]  For some reason, you watch a bunch of old black and white shit. They're always calling them robots.
[03:35.040 --> 03:37.380]  Really? That's great.
[03:37.620 --> 03:43.700]  I didn't know that. Is there like an episode this is from or am I just writing Twilight Zone robot?
[03:44.440 --> 03:47.740]  Well, I put a picture. I can't remember what episode it's from, but I remember seeing it.
[03:48.080 --> 03:51.360]  It was pretty mobile, pretty cool, pretty black and white.
[03:51.900 --> 03:55.340]  Oh, wow. You know, it's weird. I've seen this robot, or sorry,
[03:55.620 --> 03:58.580]  robot, but I don't know anything else about it.
[03:58.820 --> 03:59.380]  Oh, interesting.
[03:59.700 --> 04:02.880]  Yeah, well, you've seen him in other stuff, too, because he looks pretty much identical
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.680]  to the robot that was on that TV show. What was it called?
[04:06.680 --> 04:07.960]  The Jetsons?
[04:08.960 --> 04:12.080]  No, I'm going to say Flash Gordon.
[04:14.160 --> 04:19.420]  He looks like every robot from everything that was from the 1950s and 1960s.
[04:19.600 --> 04:21.480]  Oh, shared the same robot between studios.
[04:21.680 --> 04:24.900]  Yeah, what the fuck was it called? Why can't I think of it? Lost in Space.
[04:25.380 --> 04:27.820]  Oh, yeah, he does look like the Lost in Space robot.
[04:28.180 --> 04:31.520]  Daniel Robinson. Yeah, good robot.
[04:31.940 --> 04:35.060]  That's a good robot, but not the one you pick. You happen to pick this robot,
[04:35.060 --> 04:37.920]  which is from the Twilight Zone, and his name is Twilight Zone Robot.
[04:38.620 --> 04:43.580]  So Twilight Zone Robot is number one. Number one best robot pick from Gavin.
[04:43.920 --> 04:47.060]  You also called him a little robot, which is weird because he's human size.
[04:47.620 --> 04:49.400]  But that's neither here nor there, I suppose.
[04:49.620 --> 04:52.200]  He's smaller than like Mechagodzilla and stuff.
[04:52.540 --> 04:56.700]  He is most things. I think we're smaller than Mechagodzilla, but I don't, you know.
[04:57.180 --> 04:59.920]  Mechagodzilla is an insane scale to work from.
[04:59.920 --> 05:06.820]  Yeah, a robot. So to you, a robot that's normal size is Mechagodzilla.
[05:07.300 --> 05:09.820]  Everything else is smaller or everything.
[05:10.880 --> 05:12.600]  I should have picked Mechagodzilla.
[05:15.920 --> 05:20.640]  That's the bog standard regulation robot size, Mechagodzilla.
[05:21.880 --> 05:29.600]  Wow. Wow. OK, well, we go to Nick to see what his first pick in this robot draft is.
[05:30.400 --> 05:36.200]  Well, it's the coolest, slickest, scariest robot that you can remember from the 90s.
[05:36.280 --> 05:39.960]  And your parents are dead because it's the T-1000.
[05:40.260 --> 05:44.960]  Wow, T-1000 is a good one. That's pretty cool. It's a good pick.
[05:45.240 --> 05:47.440]  Is it really a robot, though? Because it's just metal.
[05:47.960 --> 05:54.800]  It was on every list of best robots in film all time that I read. So I would say yes.
[05:55.100 --> 05:55.660]  Interesting.
[05:56.100 --> 05:57.600]  Why does it being all metal?
[05:57.600 --> 06:00.980]  Well, it just doesn't have any electronics. It's just liquid metal in it.
[06:01.480 --> 06:03.020]  Well, I think the whole thing is electronics.
[06:03.160 --> 06:06.120]  They turned electronics into liquid metal. I think that's what it was, right?
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.880]  Yeah, that was the technology. You know what? Fair play.
[06:09.180 --> 06:10.340]  If it's conductive, it's a robot.
[06:10.680 --> 06:12.620]  Yeah, it's a pre-nanotech shit.
[06:12.700 --> 06:14.880]  I think we talked about this on 100% Eat the other day.
[06:15.080 --> 06:20.100]  When the head split in half like that, that is like the coolest thing in a movie.
[06:20.260 --> 06:21.260]  I think that rocks.
[06:21.440 --> 06:22.720]  That's a practical effect.
[06:23.020 --> 06:25.240]  Yeah, yes, that's a prop you could buy.
[06:25.540 --> 06:27.120]  It's a puppet. Oh, is it really? Wow.
[06:27.120 --> 06:27.600]  Yeah.
[06:27.820 --> 06:30.640]  Well, it's smaller than Mechagodzilla, so I don't know.
[06:30.680 --> 06:33.820]  He is small. He's a little guy. He's just a little guy.
[06:38.000 --> 06:41.340]  Who would win in a fight, the T-1000 or Mechagodzilla?
[06:41.960 --> 06:44.980]  Oh, you mean a regular sized robot versus a tiny robot?
[06:45.220 --> 06:45.820]  Dude, I don't know.
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.960]  I don't know, man. He's just metal. He could slip inside.
[06:49.020 --> 06:53.100]  I feel like he could liquid his way up into Mechagodzilla into his Mecha brain.
[06:53.240 --> 06:54.920]  Maybe he could steal some of them too.
[06:54.920 --> 06:55.480]  No.
[06:57.080 --> 07:03.400]  But next, we go to the man who is the reason that we are doing this draft.
[07:03.560 --> 07:05.600]  The robot himself, Andrew.
[07:07.800 --> 07:08.400]  Me.
[07:08.920 --> 07:11.320]  Andrew is now a little robot in our house.
[07:11.480 --> 07:14.360]  It was Gavin's idea, but Andrew is the inspiration for the draft.
[07:14.380 --> 07:15.320]  Correct, exactly.
[07:15.800 --> 07:17.120]  Yep, rolling around.
[07:17.760 --> 07:23.800]  I'm going with a robot that is near and dear to my heart that is from the past
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.960]  and I think should stay there despite multiple attempts of trying to bring them to modern times.
[07:30.340 --> 07:32.560]  My pick is Bender.
[07:33.100 --> 07:33.820]  I love Bender.
[07:34.280 --> 07:39.420]  One of my great childhood memories is in the summer, going to my grandparents' house
[07:39.420 --> 07:43.700]  and just watching the original run of Futurama with my cousin.
[07:44.240 --> 07:44.920]  Oh, so good.
[07:45.060 --> 07:50.820]  I love that original run and have not been at all moved by anything they've tried to do
[07:50.820 --> 07:51.860]  after that.
[07:52.860 --> 07:57.200]  It's like an Arrested Development type show where they just keep bringing it back
[07:57.200 --> 07:59.600]  and I'm happy, I guess, for those who enjoy it.
[07:59.760 --> 08:01.380]  But I don't need that.
[08:01.740 --> 08:04.620]  So for you, is it more about the time that it represented in your life?
[08:05.180 --> 08:11.020]  No, I remember loving that show so much the first time I watched it as a kid.
[08:11.520 --> 08:13.720]  And I would watch like two or three episodes a day
[08:14.460 --> 08:17.120]  before we would leave to do errands and stuff.
[08:17.280 --> 08:19.100]  So it's a fond memory.
[08:19.100 --> 08:24.160]  When I think of robots close to my heart, that experience is high.
[08:24.260 --> 08:25.900]  And I just think Bender is a great character.
[08:26.140 --> 08:28.720]  Full name is Bender B. Rodriguez, I believe.
[08:28.940 --> 08:29.560]  That is correct.
[08:31.440 --> 08:32.760]  But that's a good pick.
[08:32.880 --> 08:34.000]  I felt like that's a...
[08:34.580 --> 08:35.320]  He was on my list.
[08:35.540 --> 08:35.800]  You took him.
[08:35.860 --> 08:37.980]  It's an early on the list robot pick.
[08:38.200 --> 08:38.760]  It's a good pick.
[08:38.980 --> 08:40.320]  Yeah, really good one.
[08:40.700 --> 08:46.120]  But now come to me and I hope you'll give me some leeway on my robot pick here.
[08:46.120 --> 08:47.600]  Because I don't know.
[08:48.020 --> 08:51.460]  I don't know how you guys feel about it or whatever.
[08:52.660 --> 08:56.920]  I am going to pick Andrew from Regulation Podcast.
[08:58.260 --> 08:59.320]  My number one pick.
[08:59.440 --> 09:00.660]  Was also on my list.
[09:00.900 --> 09:07.300]  My number one pick for best robot is a man on this draft.
[09:07.500 --> 09:11.940]  So the inspiration for what we're doing and the reason we're doing it,
[09:11.940 --> 09:15.920]  it's Andrew, who has already given us all time moments,
[09:16.040 --> 09:19.460]  just in like two or three things that we've all done together.
[09:20.480 --> 09:22.340]  Being a disgusting little robot.
[09:22.660 --> 09:23.160]  He's heavy.
[09:23.580 --> 09:24.540]  He's dirty.
[09:25.020 --> 09:25.460]  He's great.
[09:25.780 --> 09:28.260]  I'm ready to take on some squirrels is what I am.
[09:28.380 --> 09:31.140]  He's ready to jump off some ledges too.
[09:31.540 --> 09:32.660]  We'll shove him in my ceiling.
[09:33.120 --> 09:34.160]  He's going to get sticky.
[09:34.380 --> 09:35.360]  We're going to put him in the freezer.
[09:35.520 --> 09:36.720]  He's going to start to howl.
[09:36.880 --> 09:39.560]  It's been good so far.
[09:39.900 --> 09:41.860]  So Andrew, you're my pick.
[09:41.940 --> 09:43.600]  You need to restick me, I think,
[09:43.740 --> 09:45.680]  because I don't want to get taken by one of the squirrels.
[09:45.740 --> 09:49.180]  We need to make sure I'm strong and I can grip the ground real well
[09:49.180 --> 09:50.620]  because I ain't going up no trees.
[09:51.320 --> 09:52.140]  Could you imagine?
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.100]  Like we put it up there.
[09:53.140 --> 09:54.000]  It's like, this will be funny.
[09:54.160 --> 09:56.000]  And the squirrels just pick him up.
[09:56.280 --> 09:58.120]  It's like when an eagle steals a cell phone.
[09:59.260 --> 10:02.400]  I think maybe we should get an RC Mechagodzilla to protect him.
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.000]  Oh, shit.
[10:04.960 --> 10:06.320]  Smart, smart.
[10:07.460 --> 10:09.220]  But that's my pick is Andrew.
[10:09.220 --> 10:12.120]  And so, Jeff, this is a snake draft.
[10:12.200 --> 10:13.440]  So you actually get two picks in a row.
[10:13.520 --> 10:15.500]  And I know that's novel for you.
[10:15.800 --> 10:17.440]  I'm very excited to have the opportunity to do that.
[10:17.880 --> 10:18.480]  I'm going to kind of...
[10:18.480 --> 10:20.520]  I'm following in your footsteps a little bit, Eric,
[10:20.680 --> 10:24.420]  in that I am also picking a robot that exists in the real world.
[10:24.620 --> 10:29.440]  Although I must say he is small on the Mechagodzilla robot scale.
[10:29.600 --> 10:31.480]  He is mighty in accomplishments.
[10:31.900 --> 10:33.780]  He is an overachiever.
[10:33.940 --> 10:35.940]  I'm picking the Mars Rover.
[10:37.420 --> 10:39.160]  Oh, I like that.
[10:39.220 --> 10:40.060]  That's a good one.
[10:40.300 --> 10:41.460]  That robot's done some work.
[10:41.980 --> 10:43.520]  He continues to do work.
[10:43.600 --> 10:45.160]  Nobody's asking him to work anymore.
[10:45.600 --> 10:47.520]  We told him he was done years ago.
[10:47.520 --> 10:48.720]  And he's like, no, I'm not.
[10:49.040 --> 10:50.800]  You don't get this robot to stop.
[10:50.880 --> 10:52.600]  I'm going to keep transmitting data.
[10:52.840 --> 10:55.140]  And he does it without fail.
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.120]  That little son of a bitch won't stop.
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.240]  That is a robot after my own heart.
[10:59.500 --> 11:00.060]  Just keeps going.
[11:00.260 --> 11:00.420]  Yeah.
[11:00.740 --> 11:04.660]  Is that the universe's saddest robot where it's saying itself, happy birthday?
[11:05.160 --> 11:05.460]  Yes.
[11:06.260 --> 11:09.040]  He also... he didn't get to work from home during COVID.
[11:09.640 --> 11:09.880]  Yeah.
[11:10.040 --> 11:11.300]  Well, that's his home now.
[11:11.500 --> 11:12.100]  He lives there.
[11:12.420 --> 11:12.900]  Yeah.
[11:13.040 --> 11:15.340]  Yeah. I think it's after six months, you just live there.
[11:15.420 --> 11:18.640]  Why did they program him to sing happy birthday to himself?
[11:18.740 --> 11:20.280]  Like, it's so sad.
[11:20.540 --> 11:22.520]  It's so depressing.
[11:23.820 --> 11:30.680]  I get weirdly sad every time I see photos from Mars and it's not as red as I like to imagine it be.
[11:31.020 --> 11:32.940]  Like the movies make it so red.
[11:33.140 --> 11:35.040]  How red are you imagining Mars?
[11:35.040 --> 11:42.420]  They make it look so red and orange in like any media and it's just not that vibrant of a color.
[11:42.780 --> 11:44.620]  It's more of like a gray.
[11:45.240 --> 11:47.760]  Were you bummed when you went in the sea and discovered the sea isn't that blue?
[11:48.500 --> 11:56.540]  Well, listen, I know that there's a place in Key West apparently that it is blue as can be.
[11:56.860 --> 11:57.420]  So no.
[11:57.980 --> 11:59.860]  It ain't here in Texas, I'll tell you that.
[12:00.080 --> 12:02.140]  Neither am I, so I don't give a fuck about that.
[12:02.140 --> 12:02.340]  Yeah.
[12:03.940 --> 12:04.960]  Oh, man.
[12:05.160 --> 12:05.820]  Got me there.
[12:06.040 --> 12:10.640]  Well, Jeff, great depressing pick to start, but what's your second?
[12:11.200 --> 12:18.100]  My second pick is an interesting robot because he exists in the world of fiction and reality.
[12:18.600 --> 12:20.780]  He kind of dances between the two.
[12:20.960 --> 12:29.060]  I've been a fan of his since I was about 16 or 17 and I still enjoy him weekly.
[12:29.060 --> 12:33.040]  I'm speaking of none other than Crow T-Robot.
[12:34.440 --> 12:36.500]  That was a very good one.
[12:36.740 --> 12:37.920]  We love Crow.
[12:45.010 --> 12:45.940]  So great.
[12:46.220 --> 12:46.980]  So fun.
[12:47.660 --> 12:52.680]  If you look at him as individual parts, you can just see what he's made out of.
[12:56.480 --> 12:59.060]  Like, as a whole, great for a silhouette.
[12:59.700 --> 13:02.680]  Rough when you just look at a picture of him longer than five seconds.
[13:02.820 --> 13:06.220]  But I think Crow's a fantastic pick for the robot draft.
[13:06.400 --> 13:08.760]  Wow, it didn't even cross my mind.
[13:09.100 --> 13:10.280]  Didn't even cross my mind.
[13:11.920 --> 13:16.760]  I'm staying in the vein of, for my second pick, people that are robots.
[13:17.780 --> 13:21.400]  And I'm going to go with Haley Joel Osment robot from AI.
[13:21.400 --> 13:24.040]  Oh, that's a sad robot too.
[13:25.780 --> 13:28.620]  Haley Joel Osment is a robot in AI.
[13:29.300 --> 13:31.100]  Doesn't really do anything to make him a robot.
[13:31.500 --> 13:34.700]  He's just simply Haley Joel Osment walking around going,
[13:34.960 --> 13:37.300]  it's me, I'm a robot, the whole movie.
[13:37.480 --> 13:38.740]  And then he meets aliens.
[13:39.440 --> 13:42.740]  And then he gets a wish because the movie is Pinocchio.
[13:43.260 --> 13:45.800]  And that is what the movie, I think that's what the movie's supposed to be.
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.620]  And then he sinks.
[13:48.140 --> 13:50.140]  And then he cries to see this movie.
[13:50.140 --> 13:52.960]  And he spends 10,000 years rusting underwater.
[13:53.820 --> 13:55.400]  You've never seen that movie?
[13:55.640 --> 13:56.180]  Never saw it.
[13:56.280 --> 13:57.040]  You've never seen AI?
[13:57.560 --> 13:57.820]  Nope.
[13:58.280 --> 14:01.220]  Gavin, I have a rabbit-like question to pitch to you here.
[14:01.780 --> 14:04.500]  Are we going to classify androids as robots?
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.440]  That was a question I also had.
[14:06.820 --> 14:07.480]  I would say so.
[14:07.800 --> 14:08.080]  Okay.
[14:08.280 --> 14:10.180]  What is the difference between an android and a robot?
[14:10.720 --> 14:11.340]  I don't know.
[14:11.720 --> 14:12.100]  Words?
[14:12.320 --> 14:13.100]  I was wondering that.
[14:13.400 --> 14:15.680]  I think it's just an android is more human-like, right?
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.260]  Yeah, I think it's like a human form.
[14:17.260 --> 14:21.140]  I wasn't sure if there's a thing where like androids are robots,
[14:21.260 --> 14:22.960]  but not all robots are androids.
[14:23.040 --> 14:23.880]  If it was one of those.
[14:24.240 --> 14:25.360]  Yeah, like toads and frogs.
[14:25.580 --> 14:25.640]  Correct.
[14:25.900 --> 14:26.020]  Yeah.
[14:26.560 --> 14:28.640]  I mean, he's a robot.
[14:29.080 --> 14:30.000]  I don't know what to tell you.
[14:30.740 --> 14:33.020]  Here he is eating food and it doesn't work.
[14:38.240 --> 14:42.880]  Not that I was disputing it in any way, but that's a great defense by you.
[14:43.220 --> 14:45.820]  I don't know what else to tell you.
[14:45.820 --> 14:48.100]  He tries to eat food and it doesn't work.
[14:48.220 --> 14:50.280]  It just gets them all fucked up and gummed up and stuff.
[14:50.360 --> 14:50.860]  He's a robot.
[14:50.880 --> 14:51.980]  I don't want to see this movie anymore.
[14:52.120 --> 14:52.720]  Yeah, I can't.
[14:52.760 --> 14:53.280]  I don't either.
[14:54.680 --> 14:56.220]  That totally turned me off to it.
[14:56.260 --> 14:58.700]  Anyway, question respectfully withdrawn.
[14:59.440 --> 14:59.840]  Okay.
[15:00.020 --> 15:03.500]  I think question mostly just answered and slapped down, but that's fine.
[15:03.700 --> 15:04.260]  Not withdrawn.
[15:04.580 --> 15:06.220]  I haven't made a decision.
[15:06.500 --> 15:07.040]  Point of order.
[15:08.420 --> 15:08.820]  Overruled.
[15:09.140 --> 15:10.340]  I don't know what these words mean.
[15:10.860 --> 15:12.360]  So Haley Joel Osment's my pick.
[15:12.360 --> 15:15.920]  And now we go to Andrew for his choice here on his next robot.
[15:16.140 --> 15:16.700]  Oh, okay.
[15:16.820 --> 15:21.000]  Well, I have a question about robots as well and what is or isn't a robot.
[15:21.460 --> 15:26.000]  What percentage of robot is required for a thing to be a robot?
[15:26.980 --> 15:27.860]  51 percent.
[15:28.100 --> 15:28.400]  51.
[15:28.560 --> 15:28.740]  Yeah.
[15:29.000 --> 15:29.740]  I was going to say the same.
[15:29.920 --> 15:30.360]  Fuck.
[15:30.480 --> 15:31.920]  So if it's like 50...
[15:31.920 --> 15:32.600]  Oh, that's a great...
[15:32.600 --> 15:33.060]  Okay.
[15:33.140 --> 15:37.260]  Well, we need to get in then to the specifics of Robocop.
[15:38.460 --> 15:40.720]  He has a human face.
[15:41.180 --> 15:42.100]  He's a robot.
[15:42.800 --> 15:43.800]  He's a robot.
[15:44.060 --> 15:44.300]  Okay.
[15:44.460 --> 15:45.820]  It's in his fucking name, dude.
[15:46.020 --> 15:46.840]  Have you seen Robocop?
[15:46.900 --> 15:47.680]  Yeah, I have.
[15:48.380 --> 15:49.200]  You look at the letters.
[15:49.840 --> 15:50.560]  You look at the letters.
[15:50.560 --> 15:52.000]  It's more robot than cop.
[15:52.100 --> 15:57.660]  And then also, if you see him all torn apart without the robot shell, he's hardly man.
[15:57.800 --> 15:58.820]  It's just like a head.
[15:58.940 --> 16:00.500]  Especially in the remake.
[16:00.600 --> 16:03.100]  He was like a head with a bag of lungs hanging off it.
[16:03.100 --> 16:04.780]  It was like barely anything left.
[16:05.240 --> 16:06.380]  It was really fucked up.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.700]  I haven't seen the remake.
[16:07.700 --> 16:13.780]  But you saying 51% was terrifying because when I googled it, they said 50%.
[16:15.000 --> 16:16.960]  But it sounds like we all disagree.
[16:17.180 --> 16:18.500]  He's definitely not 50%.
[16:19.260 --> 16:21.440]  50% is a useless percentage.
[16:21.560 --> 16:22.900]  It has to be 51 and 49.
[16:23.100 --> 16:24.680]  Yeah, I just...
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.660]  I think it's fine.
[16:25.880 --> 16:28.520]  I think Robocop is such a good pick.
[16:28.700 --> 16:29.720]  And I'm going Robocop.
[16:30.060 --> 16:31.120]  I love Robocop.
[16:31.240 --> 16:32.200]  Also on my list.
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.300]  Yeah, I mean, it's so good for the Robo wants Oreo story, which is really good.
[16:37.700 --> 16:40.120]  But then the lore keeps coming.
[16:40.520 --> 16:40.800]  Yeah.
[16:40.920 --> 16:47.780]  But then also in WCW, when Robocop comes out to help Sting, he saves Sting.
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.860]  So that's the world champion.
[16:50.140 --> 16:51.600]  So that's pretty... he's helpful.
[16:52.020 --> 16:53.140]  Here's the thing with Robocop.
[16:53.720 --> 16:56.420]  I think Robocop looks so fucking cool.
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.240]  But if somebody told me they think that he looks dumb as shit, I can also see that.
[17:02.420 --> 17:03.860]  And I wouldn't fight it.
[17:03.980 --> 17:05.840]  He's cool until you see him get out of a car.
[17:06.430 --> 17:08.720]  I don't feel that way in my heart.
[17:09.080 --> 17:10.680]  I think he's just fucking awesome.
[17:10.900 --> 17:13.080]  But it swings both ways.
[17:13.180 --> 17:15.160]  And I would not fight either opinion.
[17:15.560 --> 17:15.720]  Yeah.
[17:17.140 --> 17:18.260]  I love Robocop.
[17:18.360 --> 17:18.820]  Great game.
[17:19.020 --> 17:19.960]  Most recent one.
[17:20.300 --> 17:22.140]  It's a polarizing aesthetic for sure.
[17:22.240 --> 17:22.920]  Yeah, great movie.
[17:23.100 --> 17:23.480]  Yeah, it is.
[17:23.520 --> 17:24.180]  It definitely is.
[17:24.600 --> 17:25.500]  That is my pick.
[17:25.980 --> 17:27.080]  I think that's a great pick.
[17:27.140 --> 17:27.260]  Great.
[17:27.380 --> 17:33.900]  I think that the $51.49 doesn't make any sense because he's definitely way more robot.
[17:33.900 --> 17:35.540]  Yeah, it is.
[17:35.800 --> 17:42.700]  I haven't seen Robocop 3, but I guess they get into the specifics of what in him is still human,
[17:42.820 --> 17:44.660]  which I think is a ridiculous thing.
[17:45.060 --> 17:51.460]  If you've got a titanium plate where your dick used to be, I consider you a robot.
[17:51.800 --> 17:53.640]  Once again, though, he is no Mechagodzilla.
[17:53.980 --> 17:55.820]  So I don't know what any of us are doing.
[17:56.160 --> 17:56.700]  No, no, no.
[17:56.720 --> 17:57.920]  He's actually a very small robot.
[17:58.040 --> 17:59.920]  We're picking a lot of very small robots.
[18:00.000 --> 18:00.940]  This is a little robot.
[18:00.940 --> 18:04.320]  So fucking all these robots are so fucking small, dude.
[18:04.480 --> 18:08.480]  Nick, are you picking a big robot, a regular sized robot, or a small robot?
[18:08.960 --> 18:10.080]  I'm sticking small, baby.
[18:10.260 --> 18:15.780]  And these robots used to be untrustworthy in the eyes of one particular character in this series.
[18:15.900 --> 18:20.980]  And this robot slash android proved her wrong.
[18:21.100 --> 18:24.740]  I, of course, am talking about Bishop from Aliens.
[18:25.080 --> 18:26.560]  Oh, great pick.
[18:26.960 --> 18:29.000]  One of my favorite characters of all time.
[18:29.360 --> 18:29.800]  He's great.
[18:29.800 --> 18:30.060]  Wow, really?
[18:30.560 --> 18:30.840]  Love him.
[18:31.220 --> 18:34.840]  What is it about Bishop specifically where you're like, hell yeah, this is it?
[18:35.060 --> 18:39.280]  I like that the audience and characters are just viewing him with the same lens of a previous robot
[18:39.640 --> 18:41.000]  that's dead from the first movie.
[18:41.340 --> 18:44.360]  And I think he just walks that line really well, where he's like, oh, is he?
[18:44.520 --> 18:44.800]  Isn't he?
[18:44.940 --> 18:47.040]  Oh, and then he saves the day.
[18:47.400 --> 18:50.460]  It's also Lance Hendrickson is awesome in anything he does.
[18:50.780 --> 18:51.660]  He's so good.
[18:51.760 --> 18:53.900]  He's also such a selfless character.
[18:54.040 --> 18:57.580]  There's a bit where he's getting welded into like a one foot diameter pipe.
[18:57.900 --> 18:59.420]  And he's like, oh, what's your fingers?
[18:59.420 --> 19:03.620]  He's like making sure everyone else is all right as he's been stuck in a tiny pipe.
[19:04.460 --> 19:06.660]  Is he the one that does like the knife trick thing?
[19:07.160 --> 19:07.460]  Yeah.
[19:07.560 --> 19:07.800]  Yeah.
[19:07.800 --> 19:08.240]  OK, cool.
[19:08.440 --> 19:09.240]  Yeah, that part's cool.
[19:09.460 --> 19:10.140]  That part's awesome.
[19:10.460 --> 19:12.700]  Yeah, the thing that what's his name didn't know about when it was happening.
[19:14.740 --> 19:15.460]  It's so good.
[19:17.100 --> 19:17.500]  Awesome.
[19:17.920 --> 19:19.080]  Bishop's a really good pick.
[19:19.160 --> 19:20.200]  I really like that.
[19:20.880 --> 19:22.060]  Very, very cool pick.
[19:23.200 --> 19:25.440]  And he's small compared to...
[19:25.820 --> 19:29.260]  According to Gavin and where he lists normal size robots.
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.080]  Speaking of Gavin, he has our next two picks in the robot draft.
[19:34.580 --> 19:37.980]  Your earbud fell in a coffee cup.
[19:38.420 --> 19:39.880]  You need a taco.
[19:40.160 --> 19:41.100]  Pick me up.
[19:41.960 --> 19:45.420]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless taste of love.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.060]  Paso the old El Paso.
[19:48.840 --> 19:54.160]  Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void?
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.760]  Well, with LinkedIn ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers.
[19:59.180 --> 20:04.100]  You can even target buyers by job title, industry, company, seniority, skills.
[20:05.020 --> 20:06.360]  Wait, did I say job title yet?
[20:06.760 --> 20:11.460]  Get started today and see how you can avoid the void and reach the right buyers with LinkedIn ads.
[20:11.740 --> 20:14.660]  We'll even give you a $100 credit on your next campaign.
[20:15.080 --> 20:17.740]  Get started at LinkedIn.com slash results.
[20:18.180 --> 20:19.180]  Terms and conditions apply.
[20:19.660 --> 20:19.900]  Intro.
[20:20.220 --> 20:21.220]  Oh, hang on.
[20:22.060 --> 20:23.500]  Notice you already put your pick up.
[20:23.500 --> 20:25.020]  He's got squirrel problems, everybody.
[20:25.720 --> 20:26.520]  Give him a moment.
[20:27.000 --> 20:27.840]  They've breached.
[20:28.060 --> 20:28.680]  They're inside.
[20:28.860 --> 20:32.140]  They're losing their minds over this potential Mechagodzilla pick that's coming.
[20:33.940 --> 20:37.040]  Man, I would love to have... I'm so stupid for not including Mechagodzilla.
[20:37.260 --> 20:37.700]  What a moron.
[20:37.760 --> 20:38.280]  Add him now!
[20:38.340 --> 20:39.000]  You can now!
[20:39.640 --> 20:40.980]  Yeah, you have the power!
[20:41.220 --> 20:41.520]  Or...
[20:41.520 --> 20:42.500]  You have two picks.
[20:43.000 --> 20:49.800]  I could go for one of my favorite robots from a 1950s film.
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.720]  It's the robot from Forbidden Planet.
[20:53.940 --> 20:55.460]  Oh, I see where this is going.
[20:56.100 --> 20:57.300]  I see what you're doing.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.380]  He's a great little robot.
[20:58.880 --> 21:00.900]  He's got some cool little things on him.
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.740]  Pick it up when you're putting down!
[21:03.120 --> 21:04.960]  This is stupid.
[21:05.140 --> 21:05.860]  He's put on a robot.
[21:06.280 --> 21:07.640]  Gavin's got a theme for once.
[21:07.780 --> 21:08.060]  I love it.
[21:08.100 --> 21:08.340]  Hey!
[21:10.540 --> 21:11.900]  And he's quite small, isn't he?
[21:12.000 --> 21:15.320]  Do you think everyone's gonna get mad at him like the way they get mad at you, Jeff?
[21:15.360 --> 21:16.280]  Or do you think it's gonna be okay?
[21:16.520 --> 21:19.780]  Dude, I get so fucking crucified when I do this.
[21:19.780 --> 21:22.600]  If Gavin gets away scot-free, I'm gonna be really annoyed.
[21:26.880 --> 21:31.920]  Now, I haven't seen either of the stories relating to these robots.
[21:33.140 --> 21:36.900]  Are they supposed to be like modern inventions?
[21:37.160 --> 21:40.820]  Because they're so bulky and unnecessarily large.
[21:41.060 --> 21:43.820]  Although small on the mecha scale, as I know.
[21:44.020 --> 21:49.760]  But they just don't seem user-friendly or convenient in any way with how they're designed.
[21:49.780 --> 21:51.140]  That's the robot of the future.
[21:51.680 --> 21:53.960]  Well, you have to think, too.
[21:54.140 --> 21:58.780]  Like, in the 1950s and 60s when this was made, a computer was the size of a building.
[21:59.280 --> 21:59.620]  Sure.
[21:59.800 --> 22:02.320]  So this was their idea of tiny.
[22:02.760 --> 22:06.380]  I feel like every robot in Fallout was inspired by this robot.
[22:06.580 --> 22:07.780]  Oh, absolutely.
[22:08.940 --> 22:12.800]  Yeah, I've destroyed that specific robot a million times.
[22:15.620 --> 22:16.620]  No hesitation.
[22:17.860 --> 22:23.000]  Um, well, you know, two is true, but let's see if three is a pattern.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.880]  Because the next pick is Gavin again.
[22:24.880 --> 22:26.980]  And let's see what he picks here for his next robot.
[22:29.100 --> 22:30.100]  Interesting you ask.
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.240]  Uh, I'm gonna go...
[22:31.900 --> 22:33.660]  I mean, truly, truly, Gavin?
[22:33.980 --> 22:34.700]  Not that interesting.
[22:35.040 --> 22:36.800]  This is the order in which this goes.
[22:36.820 --> 22:37.740]  Kind of expected.
[22:38.100 --> 22:39.920]  Pretty expected and normal that you ask.
[22:39.980 --> 22:41.420]  But this time, I'm gonna go for a...
[22:41.920 --> 22:43.020]  It's quite a small robot.
[22:43.080 --> 22:44.920]  It's slightly taller than the man in the picture.
[22:45.480 --> 22:48.200]  It's the robot from Columbo.
[22:48.760 --> 22:50.280]  It's a great robot.
[22:51.320 --> 22:52.840]  He talks to the robot.
[22:52.940 --> 22:55.000]  He's asking the robot stuff about murders.
[22:55.480 --> 22:56.600]  The robot's filling him in.
[22:57.200 --> 22:57.900]  Phenomenal robot.
[22:58.440 --> 22:59.300]  Great, great.
[22:59.680 --> 23:02.000]  This is a Steven Spielberg draft.
[23:02.420 --> 23:05.820]  This is ridiculous.
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.040]  Oh my god.
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.220]  I like that his ear is like one up, one to the side.
[23:12.080 --> 23:12.920]  Oh man.
[23:13.160 --> 23:14.640]  In everything he's in.
[23:14.920 --> 23:15.920]  Every iteration.
[23:20.730 --> 23:23.810]  What's going on with Columbo's posture in this?
[23:23.890 --> 23:24.770]  He's intrigued.
[23:25.410 --> 23:26.270]  He's Columbo.
[23:26.710 --> 23:28.050]  He's intrigued by the robot.
[23:28.650 --> 23:29.510]  I mean, so would I.
[23:30.630 --> 23:33.090]  But he looks kind of huddled up.
[23:33.830 --> 23:37.970]  He looks thicker than I think of Columbo, typically.
[23:38.710 --> 23:40.830]  I think it's an interesting pose.
[23:41.970 --> 23:43.570]  It might just be the way the jacket's hanging.
[23:44.150 --> 23:44.650]  I don't know.
[23:44.650 --> 23:47.130]  I can't articulate exactly what I'm seeing here.
[23:47.170 --> 23:50.050]  But that is not a pose I've seen Columbo in, typically.
[23:50.470 --> 23:52.210]  He was always a bit of a gremlin, I feel.
[23:52.250 --> 23:53.750]  Yeah, I feel like he's hunched quite a lot.
[23:53.870 --> 23:54.470]  He's always like...
[23:54.470 --> 23:54.810]  You know what?
[23:55.010 --> 23:56.950]  He definitely is, yeah.
[23:57.150 --> 23:59.110]  Well, he's just asking the robot just one more thing.
[23:59.310 --> 23:59.850]  Just one more thing.
[23:59.870 --> 24:00.910]  He's also with a robot.
[24:01.170 --> 24:01.850]  When have you seen that?
[24:02.210 --> 24:02.870]  Yeah, that's true.
[24:03.070 --> 24:04.230]  That's also very true.
[24:04.510 --> 24:04.790]  Yeah.
[24:05.230 --> 24:07.790]  I mean, Columbo's typically talking to people and...
[24:07.790 --> 24:08.290]  Yeah, and his dog.
[24:08.290 --> 24:11.070]  Maybe he's just mystified by how small this robot is.
[24:11.670 --> 24:12.070]  Possible.
[24:13.230 --> 24:14.990]  Alexa, order a coffee!
[24:15.230 --> 24:18.450]  Like, he's just yelling commands at it and he doesn't know how this works.
[24:19.270 --> 24:20.450]  Columbo using Alexa?
[24:20.690 --> 24:23.150]  We need to bring back Funny or Die just so we can make that.
[24:23.730 --> 24:24.130]  Yes!
[24:25.070 --> 24:29.670]  Can be for Old Spice or something and they could pay everyone, like, less than union wages.
[24:29.790 --> 24:30.330]  That's exciting.
[24:30.830 --> 24:34.390]  I would definitely use Alexa, though, if it was in that corner of the kitchen.
[24:35.130 --> 24:36.790]  Sounds like you have some 3D printing to do.
[24:38.070 --> 24:40.010]  Put Andrew's head on that thing and you got it.
[24:40.170 --> 24:40.530]  This is exciting.
[24:40.530 --> 24:40.810]  Yeah!
[24:42.110 --> 24:45.030]  Well, Nick, you've seen what Gavin's picked so far.
[24:45.310 --> 24:47.370]  It's now your third pick in the Robot Draft.
[24:49.130 --> 24:53.190]  Gavin mentioned Fallout, which got me thinking about a certain character that I actually found
[24:53.190 --> 24:58.190]  very interesting. I know Fallout 4 kind of divided fan base on how they felt about it.
[24:58.230 --> 24:58.790]  I love the game.
[24:58.950 --> 24:59.050]  Yeah.
[24:59.190 --> 25:03.150]  So I'm going to go with one partner in that game, Nick Valentine.
[25:03.550 --> 25:03.890]  I knew it.
[25:04.230 --> 25:05.070]  I knew it.
[25:05.330 --> 25:08.790]  Who is an old private eye, old world detective kind of dude.
[25:08.870 --> 25:11.410]  And he even has a cool quest line where you can go and solve all that stuff.
[25:11.410 --> 25:14.770]  But he's also just an interesting character since, you know, you have to deal with all
[25:14.770 --> 25:16.470]  the synths throughout that game anyway.
[25:16.610 --> 25:17.230]  And he is one.
[25:17.490 --> 25:19.070]  So how does he play in this world?
[25:19.130 --> 25:19.710]  He's a great pick.
[25:19.930 --> 25:23.310]  He's probably the companion that I used the most when I played the game.
[25:23.570 --> 25:23.910]  Definitely.
[25:24.150 --> 25:24.390]  Same.
[25:24.730 --> 25:24.850]  Yeah.
[25:25.030 --> 25:25.230]  Yeah.
[25:26.030 --> 25:31.290]  He was the most interesting character in a game full of less than interesting characters.
[25:32.210 --> 25:32.890]  I like the reporter.
[25:33.790 --> 25:34.910]  Yeah, right, right.
[25:35.250 --> 25:39.190]  We're jerry picking things that were interesting in the game that was sort of bland, I think,
[25:39.290 --> 25:39.830]  is what I'm saying.
[25:41.050 --> 25:42.010]  I like him.
[25:43.870 --> 25:44.530]  It's fun.
[25:44.770 --> 25:45.970]  Well, Nick Valentine.
[25:46.490 --> 25:47.970]  Very, very good pick.
[25:48.110 --> 25:52.550]  A very small robot compared to a regular sized robot.
[25:52.810 --> 25:53.990]  Same name as you, Nick.
[25:54.470 --> 25:55.410]  I know, I like him more.
[25:56.330 --> 25:57.290]  Very interesting.
[25:57.850 --> 25:58.170]  Right?
[25:58.930 --> 26:02.010]  A draft of just Nick robots would have been really interesting if you could make a draft
[26:02.010 --> 26:02.430]  out of that.
[26:02.530 --> 26:03.310]  Nick draft.
[26:03.530 --> 26:03.750]  Yeah.
[26:04.190 --> 26:04.650]  Robot Nick.
[26:06.150 --> 26:07.110]  Robot Nick!
[26:08.170 --> 26:09.130]  Nick draft.
[26:09.130 --> 26:10.310]  I'm writing it down.
[26:10.310 --> 26:11.010]  Yeah, write it down.
[26:11.050 --> 26:11.950]  Write down Nick draft.
[26:12.110 --> 26:12.950]  That's a really good idea.
[26:13.210 --> 26:13.750]  I like it.
[26:14.070 --> 26:17.190]  Andrew, you are the titular robot in this robot draft.
[26:17.270 --> 26:18.110]  So what's your next pick?
[26:18.890 --> 26:22.710]  Nick Valentine is an interesting one because we're going to do a sidekicks draft.
[26:22.850 --> 26:25.170]  And he was on my list for sidekicks.
[26:25.410 --> 26:25.790]  Wow.
[26:25.810 --> 26:28.670]  So that pulls him from that.
[26:29.670 --> 26:33.250]  But I am going with, once again, we talked about Robocop.
[26:33.550 --> 26:34.410]  It's in the name.
[26:34.870 --> 26:38.350]  To me, an iconic robot that is not in the name.
[26:38.350 --> 26:39.710]  It's actually quite the opposite.
[26:40.050 --> 26:41.910]  I am drafting Mega Man.
[26:42.450 --> 26:44.410]  Love me some Mega Man.
[26:44.890 --> 26:47.070]  He's got a blaster for an arm.
[26:47.170 --> 26:48.590]  He goes around, he fights bosses.
[26:49.090 --> 26:52.690]  Those are such fun games that they'll never bring back because people don't want them.
[26:52.930 --> 26:55.690]  But I really enjoyed all those games.
[26:56.050 --> 26:57.230]  So that's not a man in a suit?
[26:57.670 --> 26:58.490]  No, it's a robot.
[26:58.770 --> 26:59.090]  Oh.
[26:59.630 --> 27:01.530]  Mega Man's a full robot all the way.
[27:01.710 --> 27:02.170]  That's crazy.
[27:02.250 --> 27:02.730]  I didn't know that.
[27:03.090 --> 27:03.210]  Yeah.
[27:03.250 --> 27:04.010]  I thought he was a cyborg.
[27:04.230 --> 27:07.090]  No, he's there's no human part of Mega Man.
[27:07.150 --> 27:07.730]  He's fully.
[27:07.730 --> 27:08.530]  What about his face?
[27:09.030 --> 27:09.370]  What about?
[27:09.470 --> 27:10.590]  Okay, what about his face?
[27:11.150 --> 27:11.710]  It's human looking.
[27:12.270 --> 27:12.750]  Okay.
[27:13.270 --> 27:15.050]  And they made him look like that.
[27:16.670 --> 27:17.970]  Oh, all right.
[27:18.590 --> 27:20.490]  I respectfully withdraw my question.
[27:20.530 --> 27:22.310]  Stop respectfully withdrawing your questions.
[27:22.450 --> 27:23.070]  What do you think?
[27:23.490 --> 27:25.750]  Do you think Rush is an actual dog?
[27:26.430 --> 27:26.910]  It's a band.
[27:27.470 --> 27:27.710]  Okay.
[27:30.330 --> 27:33.370]  My question is disrespectfully withdrawn.
[27:33.910 --> 27:35.510]  That dog sang Tom Sawyer.
[27:38.470 --> 27:39.690]  Spirit of the radio, baby.
[27:40.010 --> 27:41.770]  I think Mega Man's a great pick.
[27:41.990 --> 27:43.890]  I don't know if they're going to make any more of those games.
[27:44.030 --> 27:47.210]  I think the last one that they made was like sort of like medium received.
[27:48.290 --> 27:50.970]  And I guess that kind of goes into my next pick also.
[27:51.570 --> 27:55.290]  Because my next pick is Michael Fassbender robot from Prometheus.
[27:55.590 --> 28:02.610]  And I don't anticipate them making any more Prometheus-esque movies after Rambliss or whatever.
[28:03.210 --> 28:03.830]  Ah, David.
[28:04.090 --> 28:04.870]  Yeah, David.
[28:04.970 --> 28:05.710]  His name is David.
[28:05.890 --> 28:06.070]  Yes.
[28:06.070 --> 28:07.050]  He'll do the finger.
[28:07.250 --> 28:09.790]  And also, yeah, he's creepy as shit.
[28:11.770 --> 28:12.990]  So that's my pick.
[28:13.050 --> 28:16.550]  Michael Fassbender, I think, is a great actor that should be in more stuff,
[28:16.790 --> 28:18.010]  especially after Black Bag.
[28:18.350 --> 28:19.450]  Put that guy in more things.
[28:19.790 --> 28:22.570]  I think he probably had kids and then he went, I don't want to do this right now.
[28:22.710 --> 28:26.510]  And now is the time for him to come back as the robot and answer
[28:26.950 --> 28:29.290]  all the questions we had left over from Prometheus.
[28:29.390 --> 28:30.550]  Like, what's going on?
[28:31.010 --> 28:31.890]  Where are you going?
[28:32.270 --> 28:33.350]  What is this?
[28:33.430 --> 28:34.510]  And many others.
[28:34.510 --> 28:36.370]  You mean Alien Covenant didn't do that?
[28:38.030 --> 28:42.150]  Prometheus is a weird movie because it follows like what Alien did, almost like beat for beat,
[28:42.610 --> 28:45.190]  and then just goes in like a different direction, kind of.
[28:45.310 --> 28:45.690]  I don't know.
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.310]  I just don't know why they made it.
[28:47.430 --> 28:48.490]  I don't know why they made Prometheus.
[28:49.010 --> 28:49.670]  Got a squid.
[28:50.230 --> 28:51.590]  Got a big old alien squid.
[28:53.190 --> 28:54.710]  That's all I think about with Prometheus.
[28:55.350 --> 28:57.010]  I think about when the guy dissolves.
[28:57.310 --> 28:59.710]  He drinks the stuff and he dissolves into the water.
[28:59.850 --> 29:00.930]  Dissolves into the water, yeah.
[29:01.010 --> 29:02.310]  It's the most interesting part of the movie.
[29:02.410 --> 29:03.470]  It happens like right at the beginning.
[29:03.570 --> 29:04.490]  You go, what is this?
[29:04.490 --> 29:06.410]  And then it's like, yeah, don't worry about this.
[29:06.550 --> 29:09.630]  I like when the old guy's like, what's the meaning of us?
[29:09.670 --> 29:14.230]  And the robot's like, yeah, he just like fucking picks him up.
[29:14.390 --> 29:14.930]  Fuck you.
[29:15.030 --> 29:16.590]  It's like, how dare you talk to me?
[29:17.850 --> 29:19.470]  Is that how you make cress, Gavin?
[29:20.530 --> 29:22.550]  Some person drinking, dissolving.
[29:22.650 --> 29:24.010]  Yep, dissolving into the water.
[29:25.250 --> 29:27.150]  Jeff, you're at the end.
[29:27.310 --> 29:29.130]  So Snake rules.
[29:29.270 --> 29:31.450]  You get three and you get four.
[29:31.590 --> 29:34.390]  This is your final two picks for the robot draft.
[29:34.490 --> 29:36.790]  This is exciting for me for a couple of reasons.
[29:36.890 --> 29:38.790]  One, I'm really excited about my third pick.
[29:39.010 --> 29:41.570]  But two, I don't know what my fourth pick is yet.
[29:41.630 --> 29:42.290]  I haven't decided.
[29:42.470 --> 29:46.230]  So future Jeff is going to figure that out in about, I don't know, 45 seconds.
[29:46.570 --> 29:46.690]  Cool.
[29:47.990 --> 29:53.030]  For my third pick, I'm excited to go with a robot that is near and dear to my heart.
[29:53.150 --> 29:58.910]  It's one of the few robots that I have owned and used throughout my adulthood.
[29:59.050 --> 30:03.730]  It's also a robot that has appeared in content and done very well for Gavin and I.
[30:03.730 --> 30:07.370]  I am speaking, of course, of the Roomba.
[30:07.510 --> 30:10.110]  Ooh, classic robot.
[30:10.270 --> 30:11.090]  So many iterations.
[30:11.690 --> 30:11.890]  Yeah.
[30:12.210 --> 30:13.630]  That's a really great one.
[30:14.010 --> 30:15.430]  That's so many iterations.
[30:15.870 --> 30:17.130]  Yeah, especially with the knives too.
[30:18.130 --> 30:19.150]  Do you guys like doing that?
[30:19.170 --> 30:20.650]  Do you guys like the knife Roomba thing?
[30:20.850 --> 30:22.270]  Like you feel like that's something we should...
[30:22.270 --> 30:23.090]  Should we do that with Andrew?
[30:23.870 --> 30:26.010]  Yeah, I want a knife attached to me.
[30:26.230 --> 30:30.070]  You put a knife on Andrew and you have him chase down a Roomba to see if he can do it?
[30:30.350 --> 30:33.070]  Maybe we should all wear some metal ankle guards.
[30:33.070 --> 30:33.770]  No.
[30:33.790 --> 30:34.350]  No kidding.
[30:34.710 --> 30:35.250]  Oh, yeah.
[30:35.310 --> 30:37.070]  No, why did you say no?
[30:37.830 --> 30:42.070]  Okay, in my defense, in my defense, this is what happened.
[30:42.150 --> 30:47.030]  Okay, we were all talking about attaching a knife to me and running around catching people.
[30:47.310 --> 30:50.930]  And then Gavin brought up ankle guards like I would target you guys.
[30:51.030 --> 30:53.810]  And that my brain went that like, that was the content idea.
[30:54.250 --> 30:58.170]  I'm now seeing that it's just like a helmet, like a protection type thing.
[30:58.170 --> 31:02.930]  You guys are all wearing protection for when I potentially accidentally go rogue.
[31:03.090 --> 31:03.930]  I misunderstood.
[31:04.290 --> 31:05.550]  I thought Gavin was pitching.
[31:05.930 --> 31:07.890]  You view ankle guards as a helmet?
[31:08.830 --> 31:09.850]  Well, it's protection.
[31:10.170 --> 31:11.730]  That's the point I was articulating.
[31:11.990 --> 31:14.390]  You know, like Spartan helmet, as we went over recently.
[31:15.730 --> 31:16.770]  Spartan anklets.
[31:17.850 --> 31:18.770]  Keep them safe.
[31:19.170 --> 31:20.330]  Jesus Christ.
[31:20.950 --> 31:24.030]  I thought Gavin was pitching that I chase after you guys with a knife.
[31:24.130 --> 31:25.450]  That's why I said no immediately.
[31:26.060 --> 31:28.290]  But I was also thinking about that.
[31:28.410 --> 31:32.750]  I don't want a knife when I go see the squirrels because I would feel so bad
[31:32.750 --> 31:35.210]  to accidentally knife one of those little guys.
[31:35.410 --> 31:37.790]  Little menaces up there.
[31:39.270 --> 31:40.150]  No knives.
[31:40.630 --> 31:45.010]  All except actually, there will be knives, but no attacking with the knives.
[31:48.410 --> 31:49.230]  I'm great.
[31:50.870 --> 31:53.570]  I'm as good as one can be that's smaller than Mechagodzilla.
[31:54.590 --> 32:00.130]  For my fourth pick, the first three robots I picked were kind of grounded in reality
[32:00.130 --> 32:01.590]  and robots that kind of exist.
[32:01.710 --> 32:08.530]  But I decided for the fourth pick that instead of trying to follow along that thought line,
[32:09.170 --> 32:14.050]  I would pick something an enjoyable robot that I like from popular culture and from media.
[32:14.370 --> 32:17.510]  And so I'm going to go with a bit of a bad guy,
[32:17.630 --> 32:23.410]  but just a delightful robot to interact with and one of the best villains in a video game.
[32:23.570 --> 32:25.090]  I think I've experienced.
[32:25.190 --> 32:26.050]  I'm going to go with GLaDOS.
[32:27.310 --> 32:29.170]  Yeah, that was on my list.
[32:29.390 --> 32:30.430]  That's a good one pick.
[32:30.770 --> 32:31.010]  Yeah.
[32:31.290 --> 32:33.170]  Terrifying, but lately would have been a good pick.
[32:33.190 --> 32:33.570]  Damn it.
[32:33.610 --> 32:33.710]  Yeah.
[32:34.390 --> 32:37.290]  Well, you still have a little time.
[32:38.150 --> 32:41.650]  You seem upset, like, like everything's passed.
[32:42.030 --> 32:42.470]  They keep going.
[32:42.590 --> 32:43.410]  I should have picked that.
[32:43.490 --> 32:45.350]  And you have more a pick.
[32:45.430 --> 32:46.750]  You can still pick that.
[32:46.930 --> 32:47.830]  Trust me, everything's passed.
[32:51.030 --> 32:51.730]  Walked in.
[32:53.090 --> 32:55.110]  Trust me, it's nuts.
[32:56.950 --> 33:00.910]  Hey, Fidelity, what's it cost to invest with the Fidelity app?
[33:01.810 --> 33:08.490]  Start with as little as $1 with no account fees or trade commissions on U.S. stocks and ETFs.
[33:09.270 --> 33:10.710]  That's music to my ears.
[33:11.070 --> 33:12.270]  I can only talk.
[33:14.270 --> 33:15.670]  Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.
[33:15.770 --> 33:17.250]  Zero account fees apply to retail brokerage accounts only.
[33:17.390 --> 33:18.430]  Sell order assessment fee not included.
[33:18.550 --> 33:21.070]  A limited number of ETFs are subject to a transaction-based service fee of $100.
[33:21.070 --> 33:23.050]  See full list at Fidelity.com slash commissions.
[33:23.170 --> 33:24.170]  Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC.
[33:24.330 --> 33:25.350]  Member NYSE SIPC.
[33:27.390 --> 33:33.050]  Introducing the new Volvo XC90 with seven-seat versatility, Google built-in,
[33:33.250 --> 33:36.230]  and advanced safety features for all your precious cargo.
[33:36.550 --> 33:39.470]  The new Volvo XC90, designed for life.
[33:39.690 --> 33:42.030]  Visit volvocars.com slash U.S. to learn more.
[33:43.410 --> 33:45.530]  I think Gladys is a great pick.
[33:45.690 --> 33:46.190]  Thank you, thank you.
[33:46.670 --> 33:47.930]  We go to my last pick.
[33:47.930 --> 33:52.050]  And again, I'm going to ask for some leeway, see if you guys will allow this.
[33:53.070 --> 33:57.130]  Really, really, there's no way I'm probably going to back down from this because I think,
[33:57.290 --> 33:58.070]  you know, I'm right.
[33:58.690 --> 34:01.530]  I'm going to go with Harrison Ford Robot and Blade Runner.
[34:02.250 --> 34:02.530]  Yeah.
[34:03.370 --> 34:04.110]  Yeah, that's fine.
[34:04.610 --> 34:05.070]  Yeah, that's fine.
[34:05.130 --> 34:05.890]  He's a replicant.
[34:06.010 --> 34:06.930]  He's a replicant.
[34:07.230 --> 34:07.430]  Yeah.
[34:07.870 --> 34:09.810]  I think that's heavily, heavily inferred.
[34:10.030 --> 34:12.530]  If you have a problem with that, argue in the comments, guys.
[34:13.250 --> 34:15.270]  That's... he had a baby though.
[34:15.270 --> 34:16.430]  Mmm hmm.
[34:16.610 --> 34:18.070]  Didn't they undo that in the second movie?
[34:19.430 --> 34:19.830]  Ohhhh.
[34:21.210 --> 34:24.010]  Wait, wasn't the whole second movie about he had a kid?
[34:24.390 --> 34:25.750]  I meant to him being a robot.
[34:26.490 --> 34:27.630]  I didn't see the second one.
[34:28.750 --> 34:30.350]  No, he's still a robot.
[34:31.070 --> 34:31.470]  OK.
[34:32.510 --> 34:32.750]  All right.
[34:33.270 --> 34:34.290]  I didn't see the second one either.
[34:34.770 --> 34:35.710]  Wait, you didn't see the second one.
[34:36.670 --> 34:39.250]  Wait, hang on.
[34:39.390 --> 34:40.430]  Hang on, hang on.
[34:40.510 --> 34:42.010]  Nick, you didn't see the second one?
[34:42.750 --> 34:42.990]  No.
[34:42.990 --> 34:45.590]  Okay, but how do you feel about Minority Report?
[34:47.870 --> 34:50.130]  Just giving opinions to things we hadn't seen.
[34:51.010 --> 34:53.750]  It's been confirmed by Ridley Scott that he's a replicant.
[34:53.990 --> 34:59.190]  So, okay, so wait, Nick was like, yeah man, they undid that.
[34:59.930 --> 35:01.850]  I've heard rumors on the streets.
[35:02.490 --> 35:05.330]  Yeah, yeah, I heard rumors on Wikipedia that I might have...
[35:06.030 --> 35:07.770]  Well, no, I didn't read the article. Never mind.
[35:08.190 --> 35:10.870]  Nick is how misinformation starts.
[35:13.530 --> 35:15.210]  Yeah, put it. Whatever, I don't care.
[35:15.910 --> 35:16.310]  Phenomenal.
[35:16.570 --> 35:17.870]  I need to see the sequel.
[35:18.310 --> 35:18.790]  That was wild.
[35:19.050 --> 35:21.770]  Incredible. That was... Nick, that was really crazy.
[35:22.730 --> 35:24.610]  That's some wild takes today in this draft.
[35:27.720 --> 35:30.260]  There's a good one, man. I'm impressed with you.
[35:30.660 --> 35:31.900]  I'm really impressed with you.
[35:32.380 --> 35:33.600]  Can this be behind the paywall?
[35:33.780 --> 35:36.380]  I'm generally not a fan of misinformation being spread,
[35:36.500 --> 35:39.320]  but I'm all for this and we just want to make this look like he's not...
[35:39.960 --> 35:41.380]  I'm pretty into this idea.
[35:41.860 --> 35:44.140]  Nick News is very interesting to me,
[35:44.140 --> 35:47.080]  where it's just some stuff that he heard or read one time,
[35:47.180 --> 35:49.660]  but he doesn't really know what it's from or what it's about.
[35:49.980 --> 35:54.320]  What if we did like a series where it's predict a movie sequel badly?
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.060]  I mean, I don't know what the series is, but a series called Nick News has to happen.
[35:59.420 --> 36:00.220]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:00.900 --> 36:03.160]  Just by the desk, guessing the news.
[36:04.680 --> 36:06.080]  Hey, what do you think this is about?
[36:06.380 --> 36:09.900]  We throw a date at him and he has to guess the news in his news anchor suit.
[36:09.900 --> 36:13.040]  It's like, all right, May 17th, 2029, go.
[36:13.340 --> 36:17.360]  Maybe we just like spin by a bunch of tweets and headlines without any of the full context
[36:17.360 --> 36:19.620]  and he has to like get the news from it.
[36:19.960 --> 36:20.620]  That's the news.
[36:21.020 --> 36:21.140]  Yeah.
[36:21.460 --> 36:22.940]  Today, Balloon Boy's back.
[36:25.520 --> 36:28.620]  2029, Balloon Boy returns and he's in the balloon again.
[36:28.760 --> 36:29.320]  That's awesome.
[36:29.540 --> 36:31.980]  But for real this time, right? That's what happened.
[36:32.380 --> 36:34.360]  Well, that's my fourth and final pick.
[36:34.780 --> 36:37.720]  And Andrew is down to his last pick as a robot himself.
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.780]  I don't know if I'll get pushback on this pick, much like Eric.
[36:43.480 --> 36:47.220]  I think this may be one of the great underappreciated robots.
[36:47.420 --> 36:50.460]  It's the thing that I don't think many consider to be robot.
[36:50.880 --> 36:55.500]  If you guys say it's not a robot, I guess I'm fine with that.
[36:55.540 --> 37:01.040]  But I I'm drafting vending machines, vending machines anywhere.
[37:04.780 --> 37:06.540]  Is that not a robot?
[37:06.540 --> 37:09.880]  If a Roomba is a robot, how is a vending machine not a robot?
[37:10.640 --> 37:12.280]  Well, it's in the name. It's a machine.
[37:13.580 --> 37:15.940]  Oh, a Roomba is a machine.
[37:16.300 --> 37:18.500]  A Roomba is called a vacuum cleaning robot.
[37:18.820 --> 37:20.160]  They're automated machines.
[37:20.420 --> 37:23.040]  All robots are machines, but not all machines are robots.
[37:23.500 --> 37:24.900]  Damn. Okay.
[37:25.440 --> 37:28.860]  I think we have to take a vote on...
[37:28.860 --> 37:29.920]  I mean, it's mechanical.
[37:30.660 --> 37:32.660]  Yeah, this is why I think we need to take a vote.
[37:32.800 --> 37:33.680]  So is a toaster.
[37:33.860 --> 37:35.880]  It's less human than RoboCop.
[37:36.540 --> 37:37.300]  Hold on.
[37:37.660 --> 37:39.680]  But a car is mechanical. It's not a robot.
[37:39.760 --> 37:40.840]  Yeah, a toaster is mechanical.
[37:41.240 --> 37:41.860]  Okay, so...
[37:41.860 --> 37:44.000]  There you go, Andrew. What about that?
[37:46.440 --> 37:48.580]  That is definitely a vending machine robot.
[37:49.480 --> 37:53.620]  If somebody told me that their toaster is a robot, I don't think I'd push back on that.
[37:53.760 --> 37:55.680]  That's fucking... you're an insane person.
[37:55.680 --> 37:56.800]  Are you out of your mind?
[37:57.420 --> 38:01.980]  You think if on the podcast Gavin said that his toaster was a robot,
[38:02.140 --> 38:03.440]  you would just let that slide?
[38:03.720 --> 38:05.000]  Yeah, I definitely wouldn't.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.160]  But there's no autonomy in a toaster.
[38:08.420 --> 38:11.600]  Is autonomy a necessary part of a robot?
[38:12.020 --> 38:14.720]  Well, I don't know, like a Roomba just kind of sees shit,
[38:14.880 --> 38:17.700]  it goes about based on its programming.
[38:18.220 --> 38:20.200]  That's, I feel like, function versus...
[38:21.020 --> 38:24.700]  Okay, so let's take a vote. Andrew, is a vending machine a robot?
[38:25.080 --> 38:25.280]  Yes.
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.240]  Yes or no? Okay. Gavin, is a vending machine a robot?
[38:28.900 --> 38:30.100]  Almost certainly not.
[38:30.480 --> 38:32.520]  Okay, I'm gonna vote yes.
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.440]  Um, Jeff, is a vending machine a robot?
[38:37.120 --> 38:38.260]  Not even close.
[38:38.380 --> 38:42.480]  Okay, and now we leave it up to Nick to really make the decision here
[38:42.480 --> 38:44.880]  about if Andrew can have vending machine on this list.
[38:45.300 --> 38:48.840]  Do I wanna overcome the replicant thing?
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.880]  I'm afraid no, it's not a...
[38:52.880 --> 38:55.900]  Oh, Andrew, we took a vote. I was on your side, buddy.
[38:56.420 --> 39:00.260]  Unfortunately, vending machine not gonna count as a robot.
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.100]  So you're gonna have to make another pick.
[39:02.100 --> 39:05.840]  Also, it's not a fucking robot. You're insane.
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.640]  I googled it. Google says while vending machines are automated,
[39:10.780 --> 39:14.280]  they are not generally considered robots because I guess they're not autonomous
[39:14.280 --> 39:18.280]  and they can't do complex tasks like interact with their environment.
[39:18.580 --> 39:19.440]  What about a crane game?
[39:19.800 --> 39:23.080]  I would also say they're the machine that goes wrong the most in my life.
[39:24.120 --> 39:25.380]  Really, a vending machine?
[39:25.780 --> 39:28.820]  I have bad vending machine luck. I'm always getting gummed up in them.
[39:29.480 --> 39:29.920]  Huh.
[39:30.720 --> 39:32.540]  Well, you're not supposed to put anything in it.
[39:32.760 --> 39:33.880]  You put money in it.
[39:33.880 --> 39:34.940]  Well, I put gum in it.
[39:35.360 --> 39:39.040]  Gavin's like Homer Simpson. He's got his arms stuck in there because he doesn't wanna let go of the can.
[39:39.300 --> 39:42.820]  Yep. All right. So, Andrew, vending machine is out. What you got?
[39:45.340 --> 39:49.360]  You know what? I'm sick of all these tiny robots.
[39:49.540 --> 39:56.440]  I'm going with an appropriately sized, average, standard baseline we can all measure off of.
[39:56.900 --> 39:57.340]  Mechagodzilla.
[39:58.740 --> 39:59.260]  Mechagodzilla!
[40:02.500 --> 40:07.180]  That's... he's finally a regular sized robot around here.
[40:07.380 --> 40:10.100]  I... you know what? I think it's important to recognize that.
[40:10.600 --> 40:15.140]  I was not a fan that they tried to make him not a robot in the sequel.
[40:15.540 --> 40:21.180]  I was very upset about that. But outside of that, no complaints about Mechagodzilla.
[40:21.660 --> 40:23.140]  Everyone's... everyone's good with Mechagodzilla?
[40:23.480 --> 40:24.140]  Yeah. Good with it.
[40:24.460 --> 40:25.160]  Just making sure.
[40:25.320 --> 40:26.840]  Oh, I mean, it's a robot, so definitely.
[40:26.840 --> 40:27.280]  Yeah.
[40:27.660 --> 40:31.920]  I don't know who said it's in the name. I also drafted Mega Man.
[40:32.220 --> 40:38.600]  I just want to point out how dumb that was as a counter to why a vending machine isn't a robot.
[40:38.620 --> 40:40.840]  Well, it's not called a vending robot. It's called a vending machine.
[40:41.120 --> 40:43.560]  Yeah, that's true. That's true.
[40:44.480 --> 40:48.420]  My point is, I drafted something with man in the title.
[40:49.140 --> 40:50.320]  Yeah, but he's not a man.
[40:50.460 --> 40:50.620]  Yeah.
[40:50.860 --> 40:52.200]  That's my point.
[40:53.200 --> 40:53.580]  Wait, what?
[40:53.580 --> 40:53.860]  What?
[40:57.060 --> 40:57.500]  Overruled!
[40:59.620 --> 41:01.600]  Point of order. It's Nick's turn now.
[41:01.660 --> 41:04.260]  Nick, you get your final robot pick here.
[41:04.580 --> 41:06.180]  You know, nostalgia is important.
[41:06.720 --> 41:07.500]  And, uh...
[41:07.500 --> 41:08.580]  Yeah, look at Gavin's.
[41:09.020 --> 41:11.220]  Yeah, look at... yeah, look at where Gavin's gonna go.
[41:11.260 --> 41:13.160]  And I could block him, but I won't.
[41:13.700 --> 41:14.140]  So...
[41:14.140 --> 41:15.120]  You don't know where I'm going.
[41:16.760 --> 41:18.260]  Well, now I kind of want to guess.
[41:20.340 --> 41:21.560]  No, but I...
[41:21.560 --> 41:23.020]  I'm thinking back to the...
[41:23.020 --> 41:24.660]  afternoon after school.
[41:24.740 --> 41:27.260]  After school's over, you come home, you flip on the TV,
[41:27.500 --> 41:32.200]  and there to greet you is Tom the Toonami robot.
[41:33.160 --> 41:34.380]  Oh, Tom from Toonami.
[41:35.020 --> 41:35.620]  He's a robot.
[41:36.260 --> 41:37.740]  Bloom? Bloom? Is that his name?
[41:38.160 --> 41:39.540]  Yeah, do you guys not remember this?
[41:39.780 --> 41:41.200]  Don't know that robot, no.
[41:41.600 --> 41:42.920]  Must know with him, but he seems like a robot.
[41:43.480 --> 41:44.500]  I got the American vote!
[41:44.800 --> 41:46.820]  Yeah, no, I'm with you. It's good.
[41:46.920 --> 41:48.940]  The one that I remember more was this guy.
[41:49.360 --> 41:52.700]  It's the same guy, but it's before they changed his look or whatever.
[41:52.700 --> 41:53.900]  And he's a little idiot.
[41:54.320 --> 41:55.320]  Now that's a little robot.
[41:55.780 --> 41:56.660]  Yeah, that's...
[41:56.660 --> 41:58.560]  I think to me he's a little robot.
[41:58.920 --> 41:59.560]  Yeah, that's Tom.
[41:59.560 --> 42:02.200]  Like put coins in him and he dispenses Snickers or something.
[42:03.520 --> 42:03.960]  No.
[42:06.420 --> 42:07.500]  That would be a robot.
[42:07.760 --> 42:09.820]  Can somebody lend Andrew a robot? He's short.
[42:11.300 --> 42:13.140]  This might be the smallest robot.
[42:13.800 --> 42:16.180]  Potentially on this list could be the smallest robot so far.
[42:16.320 --> 42:16.500]  Could be.
[42:17.060 --> 42:17.540]  Could be.
[42:18.240 --> 42:20.700]  However, we're going to round it out with Gavin.
[42:20.700 --> 42:24.220]  He's making his fourth and final pick in this robot draft.
[42:24.520 --> 42:26.240]  Now you may be predicting what I'm doing here.
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.840]  You might think, you know, I know Gavin, his favorite movie is The Invisible Boy.
[42:31.320 --> 42:33.240]  But that is not my fourth robot pick.
[42:33.680 --> 42:34.840]  Ah, yes, of course.
[42:35.280 --> 42:41.740]  My fourth robot pick is Arok, the housekeeping robot from the 70s.
[42:41.820 --> 42:46.580]  If you just play the first four seconds of this video, it's got Mega Man vibes.
[42:46.760 --> 42:48.380]  You know, it's a robot with a human face.
[42:50.900 --> 42:52.600]  I don't like the beginning of this video.
[42:52.980 --> 42:54.400]  Instantly, this is real bad.
[42:54.900 --> 42:56.740]  No, I don't like that.
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.440]  Very realistic housekeeping robot.
[42:59.600 --> 43:01.580]  It can pour you a drink.
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.560]  It can try and collect your mail.
[43:04.260 --> 43:07.740]  It can try and collect your mail.
[43:08.160 --> 43:10.540]  So far, everything you're describing is a vending machine.
[43:12.340 --> 43:13.480]  Can give you a drink.
[43:13.660 --> 43:14.460]  It can try.
[43:14.540 --> 43:15.720]  It will not be successful.
[43:16.140 --> 43:19.380]  Well, skip to 2.05 in the video if you want to see it attempt to collect mail.
[43:19.810 --> 43:21.400]  Okay, let's go to 2.05.
[43:21.420 --> 43:23.480]  I'm watching it give him a drink right now.
[43:23.840 --> 43:24.040]  Yeah.
[43:24.560 --> 43:25.320]  Okay, let's see.
[43:25.440 --> 43:26.780]  So his head's looking up.
[43:27.180 --> 43:28.360]  He's grabbing the mail.
[43:29.120 --> 43:30.460]  Oh, I might have spoken too soon.
[43:31.020 --> 43:32.940]  He's attempting to grab the mail.
[43:33.360 --> 43:34.980]  He's just looking at it.
[43:35.160 --> 43:35.740]  Yeah, he missed.
[43:36.500 --> 43:37.360]  Okay, he missed.
[43:37.700 --> 43:38.680]  Oh, he touched the mail.
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.460]  He pushed it back in.
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.340]  He kind of bashed it back in, but he tried.
[43:42.600 --> 43:44.320]  Yeah, and then he looks at you directly.
[43:44.700 --> 43:45.300]  I don't like his...
[43:45.300 --> 43:46.280]  I have failed you.
[43:46.280 --> 43:50.340]  I don't like his body with his head, and it has, like, antenna.
[43:50.720 --> 43:53.780]  It has antenna like he's a bug.
[43:54.200 --> 43:55.680]  I don't like... I don't like him.
[43:56.060 --> 43:57.440]  That's a great robot, Gavin.
[43:57.680 --> 43:58.320]  I love it.
[43:58.960 --> 44:01.360]  Ugly, ugly, small robot.
[44:02.140 --> 44:07.160]  I don't want a robot in my life that has the success rate of a claw machine for what it's
[44:07.160 --> 44:07.920]  trying to do.
[44:08.340 --> 44:14.780]  He gets stuck at, uh, like 20, at like 2.41, and the lady has to move him.
[44:15.760 --> 44:19.780]  There's also a bit earlier where he's walking a dog, and he accidentally goes off the road,
[44:19.860 --> 44:21.600]  and they have to run and stop him from falling over.
[44:21.640 --> 44:22.520]  Oh, no.
[44:22.640 --> 44:24.160]  It's like 1.07 in the video.
[44:24.280 --> 44:24.560]  It's great.
[44:24.640 --> 44:25.760]  Oh, man.
[44:26.440 --> 44:29.000]  Well, this robot's vile and terrible.
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.940]  I wonder what he looks like now, because all of, like, the rubber or whatever that he's
[44:33.940 --> 44:36.220]  made out of is all deteriorated and disgusting.
[44:36.720 --> 44:37.660]  It's probably really awesome.
[44:37.940 --> 44:42.980]  Did you ever see when they found the Hoggle puppet from Labyrinth, like, 30 years after
[44:42.980 --> 44:43.340]  the movie?
[44:43.800 --> 44:44.480]  No, what?
[44:44.780 --> 44:46.040]  I bet he would look like that.
[44:46.360 --> 44:47.340]  Hoggle puppet.
[44:47.980 --> 44:49.740]  Oh, oh my god.
[44:49.980 --> 44:52.780]  Oh, oh, there you go.
[44:55.220 --> 44:57.140]  They found him in a suitcase.
[44:57.540 --> 44:58.020]  Thumbnail.
[44:58.220 --> 44:59.160]  Oh my god.
[44:59.840 --> 45:00.760]  Man, what the...
[45:01.420 --> 45:02.460]  It's missing its cheek.
[45:02.560 --> 45:03.700]  Its skin is peeling.
[45:04.040 --> 45:04.940]  It looks terrible.
[45:05.420 --> 45:09.080]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure, uh, Five Nights at Freddy's got some inspo from that.
[45:09.500 --> 45:10.100]  Yeah, I think so.
[45:10.760 --> 45:12.540]  I just want to love.
[45:13.000 --> 45:14.080]  Oh, brutal.
[45:14.280 --> 45:14.580]  Is that Freddy?
[45:15.280 --> 45:15.680]  Huh?
[45:15.840 --> 45:17.180]  I've never played those games.
[45:17.280 --> 45:18.100]  I don't know how it works.
[45:19.320 --> 45:20.220]  He's not a replicant.
[45:22.540 --> 45:23.280]  The sequel was totally fun.
[45:23.280 --> 45:24.460]  And there's a cool robot in it.
[45:25.700 --> 45:29.220]  Well, speaking of cool robots, all of the cool robots have been chosen.
[45:29.700 --> 45:31.500]  We've done all the robots in the robot draft.
[45:31.640 --> 45:36.180]  Gavin has picked Twilight Zone Robot, Forbidden Planet Robot, Columbo Robot.
[45:36.660 --> 45:37.140]  Robbie the Robot.
[45:37.600 --> 45:38.320]  Robbie the Robot.
[45:39.080 --> 45:40.020]  Who's Robbie the Robot?
[45:40.320 --> 45:42.920]  I was just saying the real name of the robot as you read off each one.
[45:43.440 --> 45:44.540]  It's just called Robbie the Robot.
[45:44.780 --> 45:45.800]  You can't...
[45:45.800 --> 45:45.920]  Okay.
[45:46.120 --> 45:46.880]  How can you do that?
[45:47.000 --> 45:48.900]  You can't pick the same robot three times.
[45:49.040 --> 45:49.840]  You can't pick the same...
[45:49.840 --> 45:51.580]  That's like Andrew picking Bender four times.
[45:51.960 --> 45:54.400]  No, they're different characters, but they're all played by Robbie the Robot.
[45:54.460 --> 45:55.340]  You just told...
[45:55.920 --> 45:56.280]  What?
[45:57.880 --> 45:59.400]  All right, so audience discount.
[45:59.680 --> 46:00.980]  Two of Gavin's picks.
[46:01.060 --> 46:02.280]  He only had two in this one.
[46:02.520 --> 46:06.740]  Well, like, imagine if, uh, Robert Patrick also voiced Nick Valentine.
[46:06.900 --> 46:07.740]  That's still two robots.
[46:08.260 --> 46:09.680]  Yeah, I get what he's saying.
[46:10.200 --> 46:10.820]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
[46:11.100 --> 46:11.540]  Yeah, that's fine.
[46:12.140 --> 46:12.860]  Yeah, but he voiced it.
[46:13.280 --> 46:14.500]  He's playing a different robot.
[46:14.500 --> 46:16.520]  It's not Robbie the Robot he's selecting.
[46:16.780 --> 46:18.660]  It's the character he's selecting as the robot.
[46:19.180 --> 46:20.200]  Yeah, that's fair.
[46:20.400 --> 46:21.480]  Like Columbo Robot.
[46:22.040 --> 46:22.220]  Yeah.
[46:23.940 --> 46:26.160]  And A-Rock is your final pick.
[46:26.300 --> 46:31.160]  Nick has T-1000, Bishop, Nick Valentine, and Tom from Toonami.
[46:31.820 --> 46:35.180]  Andrew, honestly, the most conventional choices.
[46:35.540 --> 46:36.520]  I'm shocked.
[46:37.320 --> 46:41.300]  Bender, RoboCop, Mega Man, Mecha Godzilla.
[46:41.520 --> 46:42.420]  Tried to pick Vending Machine.
[46:42.560 --> 46:42.760]  Did not.
[46:44.060 --> 46:46.340]  I have picked Andrew from Regulation Podcast.
[46:46.960 --> 46:48.720]  Haley Joel Osment Robot from AI.
[46:49.100 --> 46:50.740]  Michael Fassbender Robot from Prometheus.
[46:50.940 --> 46:52.580]  And Harrison Ford Robot from Blade Runner.
[46:53.240 --> 46:55.480]  And Jeff has chosen the Mars Rover.
[46:55.960 --> 46:58.360]  Crotea Robot, Roomba, and GLaDOS.
[46:58.560 --> 47:01.440]  Guys, those are all of the robots that we chose.
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.000]  How do you guys feel about this compendium, this full list here of best robots?
[47:06.180 --> 47:06.900]  Well, I want to apologize.
[47:07.800 --> 47:11.280]  I don't usually do this thing in the drafts, but it is so fun.
[47:11.320 --> 47:12.440]  I can see why it's done so often.
[47:12.440 --> 47:14.300]  I apologize for it.
[47:16.480 --> 47:19.400]  Jeff, do you think he's going to get just blasted?
[47:19.660 --> 47:21.560]  No, I think he'll be fine. He'll get a pass.
[47:21.920 --> 47:23.460]  It's funny when Gavin does it.
[47:26.100 --> 47:28.600]  Everybody loves Gavin. He's the boy with the golden hands.
[47:31.560 --> 47:34.900]  I was so blown away by the research on this because
[47:36.180 --> 47:41.560]  typically after we do these, we always do our robots that didn't quite make the cut, you know?
[47:41.580 --> 47:41.860]  Sure.
[47:41.860 --> 47:42.880]  Our runners-up.
[47:43.280 --> 47:46.020]  But I kind of want to hold on to them just in case we ever have another robot draft.
[47:46.380 --> 47:46.500]  Oh, interesting.
[47:46.860 --> 47:48.100]  There were so many, I thought.
[47:48.280 --> 47:49.500]  I think there's more robots.
[47:49.620 --> 47:52.480]  And then we can see how many more robots Robbie the Robot was in or whatever.
[47:52.700 --> 47:53.260]  How many more movies?
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.320]  Yeah, let me see what else he was in on IMDb.
[47:55.680 --> 47:58.120]  Work on the fights for why a vending machine is...
[47:58.120 --> 48:01.680]  I have another six on my list that are all big-time robots.
[48:02.180 --> 48:02.400]  Okay.
[48:02.820 --> 48:04.460]  Well, that's our robots draft.

[48:12.860 --> 48:14.660]  But guys, this has been a robot draft.
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.660]  Andrew, as the robot, the resident robot here at Regulation,
[48:18.760 --> 48:21.780]  why don't you take us out with a cool outro and say goodbye?
[48:22.240 --> 48:22.820]  Oh, I got it.
[48:22.860 --> 48:25.300]  Do you mind if I use my native tongue for this?
[48:25.400 --> 48:26.540]  Please, by all means.
[48:27.040 --> 48:31.000]  Beep boop beep beep beep beep boop boop beep boop boop beep boop boop beep boop
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.120]  1-0-0-1 beep boop boop boop beep beep
[48:35.120 --> 48:35.540]  Snickers.
[48:36.900 --> 48:37.380]  Goodbye.
