[00:25.700 --> 00:29.360]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:29.800 --> 00:35.160]  This is season two. Episode 53 is the first episode of season two.
[00:35.640 --> 00:40.220]  Congratulations, Eric, Nick, Gavin, and Andrew, and I guess to myself, Jeff, as well.
[00:40.480 --> 00:43.080]  We didn't shit the bed in the first year.
[00:43.300 --> 00:46.840]  Most businesses completely flush themselves down the toilet in the first year,
[00:46.940 --> 00:48.540]  but we're still floating around.
[00:48.880 --> 00:50.380]  You shit your pants, but not the bed.
[00:50.640 --> 00:52.720]  Thank you so much to the audience for supporting us
[00:52.720 --> 00:57.020]  and allowing us to not flush down the toilet and fail immediately.
[00:57.280 --> 00:58.500]  Abso-fucking-lutely.
[00:58.720 --> 01:00.060]  We couldn't have done it without them.
[01:00.420 --> 01:02.140]  The audience keeps our bedsheets clean.
[01:02.520 --> 01:04.840]  The audience keeps us afloat, quite literally.
[01:05.240 --> 01:10.160]  They fill our toilet reservoir a hell of a lot faster than the one in our office does.
[01:10.500 --> 01:11.680]  Yeah, that's definitely true.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.800]  I was going to say my dump room, but I guess it's still part of our office.
[01:15.280 --> 01:16.440]  It's your dump room, though.
[01:16.980 --> 01:18.020]  Your office dumper?
[01:18.780 --> 01:21.120]  Well, they designated a bathroom just for me.
[01:21.120 --> 01:23.080]  Oh, you have your own shitter?
[01:23.540 --> 01:25.580]  Yeah, I really do. They're very kind about it.
[01:26.200 --> 01:26.840]  Oh, that's great.
[01:28.200 --> 01:29.120]  That's fancy.
[01:29.520 --> 01:31.740]  How's everybody doing living in a season two world?
[01:32.140 --> 01:37.440]  I feel so good. I feel twice as good as I did last time we did this.
[01:38.840 --> 01:39.760]  Double good.
[01:42.160 --> 01:43.760]  Man, I can't wait till season 10.
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.900]  I went to open my notes, but it just opened my worm names of the video you just blindsided away.
[01:49.900 --> 01:53.380]  I mean, I can't wait to play more worms, though.
[01:54.080 --> 01:57.220]  Whatever. We spent like $120. You're ridiculous.
[01:58.080 --> 02:01.940]  I like that he blindsided us on a game of worms that we all had to pay for.
[02:02.160 --> 02:05.040]  Yeah, we're still going to make the video.
[02:05.460 --> 02:06.880]  Yeah, if you say so.
[02:06.980 --> 02:07.920]  It doesn't change anything.
[02:08.180 --> 02:13.860]  Speaking of notes, actually, I have a note and maybe you can help me with this, Jeff.
[02:13.920 --> 02:16.120]  It just says summer movie auction debacle.
[02:16.120 --> 02:20.840]  Oh, I have a note in my. Let me see. It says this is coming up tomorrow.
[02:21.140 --> 02:23.320]  So let's put those two notes together.
[02:24.280 --> 02:27.260]  I think debacle is a strong word. I said it at the time.
[02:27.340 --> 02:30.340]  I'm going to stand by the fact that debacle is strong.
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.680]  Gavin, you're going to love this. So yesterday we did a Falcon event
[02:34.680 --> 02:40.100]  where we watched movie trailers of all of the movies that we
[02:40.100 --> 02:44.560]  incorporated into the summer movie draft, right? Which was a great event.
[02:44.560 --> 02:46.680]  We basically watched them in the order we drafted.
[02:46.800 --> 02:48.620]  And so I hadn't seen most of the trailers.
[02:48.800 --> 02:50.860]  It was cool to hang out and shoot the shit with the Falcons.
[02:51.360 --> 02:55.580]  And things went awry really quickly, though, because we got to Clown in a Cornfield,
[02:55.700 --> 02:56.800]  which is my movie.
[02:57.100 --> 02:59.740]  And Andrew said, that's not your movie. That's my movie.
[02:59.880 --> 03:05.920]  And I said, no, I even went back and watched the video that we created last week
[03:05.920 --> 03:08.600]  just to make sure it was my movie because I was a little confused
[03:08.600 --> 03:11.920]  based on some of your public comments seeming to think that you have the movie.
[03:12.300 --> 03:15.380]  And, uh, and Andrew goes, I'm pretty sure it's my movie.
[03:15.420 --> 03:17.820]  And I go, I watched the video and I'm looking and Eric goes,
[03:17.860 --> 03:20.320]  I'm looking at the sheet and it says it's Jeff's movie.
[03:20.320 --> 03:23.060]  And Andrew goes, don't look at the sheet. The sheet is wrong.
[03:23.420 --> 03:24.520]  What? Wait, what?
[03:24.920 --> 03:28.140]  No, that's not. That's not exactly how things lined up.
[03:28.260 --> 03:30.480]  Yeah. So there was a, so there was another one.
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.700]  Fighter Flight came up. We were watching the trailers of Fighter Flight.
[03:35.140 --> 03:37.160]  Said, whose movie is this? And I said, Gavin.
[03:37.300 --> 03:40.680]  And Andrew said, no, this is mine. And I said, I'm looking at the sheet.
[03:40.680 --> 03:44.080]  And it says Gavin. And then as I'm looking at the sheet,
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.500]  it changed to an editable document to a view only mode.
[03:49.560 --> 03:53.720]  And then Fighter Flight quickly changed from Gavin to Andrew.
[03:54.620 --> 03:58.280]  So let me address both these things because these are two separate issues.
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.100]  The clown in a cornfield thing unrelated to the document issue.
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.520]  That's just me remembering wrong. I thought for some reason for sure
[04:07.520 --> 04:10.340]  that I owned it just based off of memory.
[04:10.840 --> 04:14.500]  You spent a whole Worms game promoting it, which I really appreciate, by the way.
[04:14.640 --> 04:18.460]  That's exactly. And that happened before the video even came out.
[04:18.540 --> 04:23.580]  So it like shows that I just completely misremembered how that went in the draft.
[04:23.880 --> 04:27.820]  Now, what happened with the document that caused the Fighter Flight issue
[04:27.820 --> 04:32.600]  is, as you may remember, it was a whole thing where it wasn't working on my computer,
[04:32.740 --> 04:35.380]  the initial one. And so I had to make a new one.
[04:35.380 --> 04:38.760]  And then I sent it to Eric and then he couldn't edit it.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.300]  And it was a whole panic thing. So I just made it public.
[04:41.520 --> 04:46.260]  And the video came out and people found it because it was public.
[04:46.260 --> 04:50.560]  And then as a joke, swapped a bunch of the movies to being owned by Gavin.
[04:50.900 --> 04:53.380]  Why? Why do you make documents public?
[04:53.980 --> 04:55.820]  I just explain why I did it.
[04:55.820 --> 04:59.360]  And that instance of it was a moment of panic while we were recording
[05:00.020 --> 05:03.760]  and trying to get Eric access to it as immediately as possible.
[05:03.760 --> 05:09.300]  I completely agree. Not the best way to do it, but it was a panic move.
[05:09.760 --> 05:13.900]  Please, audience, stop finding, stop looking for the documents and finding them.
[05:14.100 --> 05:16.680]  Andrew is incapable of not making them public.
[05:17.240 --> 05:20.560]  Loves putting them on the Internet for the whole world to see.
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.500]  I love people to see the stuff that we do.
[05:23.940 --> 05:27.940]  Yeah, it's called view only. It's called view only mode for the for the public.
[05:28.200 --> 05:29.660]  You know what? That's a great point.
[05:30.140 --> 05:32.600]  I'm not trying to argue that I did anything right here.
[05:32.600 --> 05:34.360]  I'm just explaining why it went wrong.
[05:34.520 --> 05:36.360]  I was it was definitely in the wrong.
[05:36.680 --> 05:38.340]  It's the whole you being in charge of stuff.
[05:38.540 --> 05:41.540]  Yeah. Well, if you want to take charge of it, Gavin, you're more than welcome to.
[05:41.660 --> 05:42.480]  You go ahead.
[05:43.760 --> 05:44.300]  Happy to.
[05:45.080 --> 05:46.000]  Oh, sweet.
[05:46.360 --> 05:46.700]  I'll do it.
[05:46.720 --> 05:47.760]  Sweet. Awesome.
[05:48.260 --> 05:49.420]  I'll do it next year.
[05:50.880 --> 05:51.600]  Next year?
[05:52.980 --> 05:54.800]  Well, he needs to feel three times as good.
[05:55.080 --> 05:57.160]  Well, we did the movie auction already. We're not doing it again, are we?
[05:57.820 --> 05:58.460]  What do you mean?
[05:59.680 --> 06:00.120]  What?
[06:01.940 --> 06:07.940]  I was referencing all of the stuff relating to it, which includes sending out all of the
[06:07.940 --> 06:12.160]  Let's Plays to editors and scheduling and making sure it goes up on time.
[06:12.280 --> 06:14.940]  You're just saying do your entire job?
[06:15.400 --> 06:20.140]  No, I'm saying that if you wanted if you think you can do it so much better.
[06:20.320 --> 06:21.460]  I don't even know what I was saying.
[06:21.760 --> 06:24.520]  I was I'm saying that I was in the wrong in this.
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.200]  I don't understand.
[06:25.200 --> 06:29.360]  I don't know why you're still attacking me.
[06:29.420 --> 06:31.180]  I'm saying I fucked up. I was wrong.
[06:31.540 --> 06:33.980]  Yeah, you're really kicking him all these down, Andrew or Gavin.
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.720]  Yeah. What are you doing attacking him?
[06:35.740 --> 06:37.900]  I thought you were on his side the way he's on your side.
[06:37.980 --> 06:39.360]  I am on Gavin's side.
[06:39.500 --> 06:43.120]  He spent a whole episode defending you from the Australians like two weeks ago.
[06:43.180 --> 06:45.140]  Oh, good point. Yeah, that came out.
[06:45.740 --> 06:52.040]  It did. My point. Okay, let me because I came at you aggressively as a friend.
[06:52.100 --> 06:53.180]  I was shit talking you.
[06:53.180 --> 06:58.360]  But the heart of my sentiment was on your side in my eyes.
[06:59.860 --> 07:00.880]  Let me explain.
[07:01.480 --> 07:05.820]  There are people that are saying that's a great segment for the Australia Morning News,
[07:05.900 --> 07:08.560]  in which I agree that was totally fine.
[07:08.740 --> 07:11.820]  That's a great talk show moment thing.
[07:11.940 --> 07:14.920]  You're saying you totally agree and it's totally fine.
[07:15.260 --> 07:17.580]  I'm saying from their perspective, it is.
[07:17.580 --> 07:23.260]  What I poorly communicated was I think that you are so incredibly talented
[07:23.260 --> 07:25.020]  and have so much else going on.
[07:25.180 --> 07:30.520]  I don't know how that values you to go on there and explain why you did this thing.
[07:30.760 --> 07:32.940]  Like, I don't know what you get out of it.
[07:33.260 --> 07:38.960]  As somebody who is busy and like talks about, you know, the importance of their
[07:38.960 --> 07:40.540]  like not wanting to waste time.
[07:40.660 --> 07:44.940]  That was what I was trying to advocate is that I feel you're above what that interview was.
[07:45.320 --> 07:45.960]  Oh, I disagree.
[07:45.960 --> 07:51.680]  I think it's not often you get asked to be on a different country's morning TV show.
[07:51.880 --> 07:53.040]  That's totally true.
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.300]  And that is something that I will, I don't think ever experience.
[07:56.460 --> 07:59.840]  I'm not claiming that I deserve to be or that like I could ever.
[08:00.060 --> 08:01.840]  I hope to God you do, though.
[08:02.360 --> 08:02.980]  Yeah, me too.
[08:03.260 --> 08:04.020]  It would be a disaster.
[08:04.400 --> 08:05.260]  It would be horrendous.
[08:05.640 --> 08:07.040]  I really want to make that happen.
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.840]  I just feel like I've heard from podcasts and I feel like even you and Bernie talked
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.080]  about it on the Rooster Teeth podcast, that there is like a zero percent conversion rate
[08:16.080 --> 08:20.320]  from people seeing something on TV to then engaging with it online.
[08:20.580 --> 08:21.220]  That's true.
[08:21.480 --> 08:22.600]  That's 100% true.
[08:22.940 --> 08:23.160]  Yeah.
[08:23.460 --> 08:23.680]  Yeah.
[08:23.700 --> 08:25.180]  I wasn't really doing it for that.
[08:25.420 --> 08:26.300]  Which is totally fair.
[08:26.340 --> 08:30.220]  If you're doing it because you just want to do it and made you happy, that is totally valid.
[08:30.380 --> 08:35.540]  But just seeing a clip and also not knowing the full context of the interview, but just
[08:35.540 --> 08:41.640]  seeing one segment where it says, why did he start this, was very funny to me.
[08:43.060 --> 08:46.660]  Andrew just values your time a lot more than you do, I think.
[08:46.860 --> 08:48.180]  Oh, I don't think he does.
[08:48.180 --> 08:49.200]  I think all of us do.
[08:49.340 --> 08:54.580]  I think we all really value your time and we all know how hard you work, Gavin.
[08:54.840 --> 08:55.160]  So we...
[08:56.100 --> 08:56.520]  He does.
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.420]  He works incredibly hard.
[08:57.420 --> 08:57.480]  Yeah.
[08:58.040 --> 08:58.920]  Insanely creative.
[08:59.180 --> 09:00.420]  We care for and about you.
[09:00.420 --> 09:01.880]  Well, yeah, it's appreciated.
[09:02.240 --> 09:05.380]  But I feel like even busy people have...
[09:06.460 --> 09:10.180]  There's so much stuff I feel like scheduling where it's like a bunch of stuff on the same
[09:10.180 --> 09:11.320]  day and you have really busy days.
[09:11.480 --> 09:15.880]  But then I might have just a completely empty day and I just will fill it with whatever,
[09:16.220 --> 09:18.800]  even if like on other days it would be completely worthless.
[09:19.300 --> 09:21.600]  But I think I was still flattered to be asked on it.
[09:21.820 --> 09:22.600]  I'd make time for it.
[09:22.840 --> 09:22.980]  Yeah.
[09:23.060 --> 09:23.760]  I mean, that's fair.
[09:23.940 --> 09:27.420]  If that brings you joy, if you're flattered by it, that's awesome.
[09:27.420 --> 09:31.800]  Just wear a fucking regulation t-shirt next time you do it.
[09:31.800 --> 09:36.680]  Yeah, so if you were asked by another country's morning show to do that again, you'd do it?
[09:37.660 --> 09:38.100]  Well, yeah.
[09:38.640 --> 09:39.680]  What if I...
[09:39.680 --> 09:43.260]  Because I'm going to be honest, I didn't love the hosts of that program.
[09:44.480 --> 09:45.600]  Just my opinion.
[09:45.980 --> 09:47.780]  I didn't think that they were the most engaging.
[09:48.160 --> 09:49.780]  I thought you did an excellent job.
[09:49.880 --> 09:51.220]  I went and I watched the full thing.
[09:51.440 --> 09:52.240]  I thought you were great.
[09:52.660 --> 09:55.100]  Didn't think their performance was necessarily the best.
[09:55.300 --> 09:56.900]  You were great, Gavin.
[09:56.900 --> 09:58.900]  But they were in the middle of just...
[09:59.420 --> 10:00.500]  Gavin, Gavin, take the compliment.
[10:00.880 --> 10:02.080]  Take the compliment, man.
[10:02.440 --> 10:04.000]  I'm just defending the hosts.
[10:04.380 --> 10:05.600]  Everybody agrees you were great.
[10:05.880 --> 10:07.580]  Well, I don't want to put you in an awkward spot.
[10:07.740 --> 10:09.040]  I'm not saying you feel this way.
[10:09.100 --> 10:10.240]  I'm stating I feel this way.
[10:10.520 --> 10:13.720]  But what if they were just like day 750 into that job?
[10:13.860 --> 10:14.900]  It's like the middle of the show.
[10:15.180 --> 10:15.880]  They're just...
[10:15.880 --> 10:16.160]  Absolutely.
[10:16.480 --> 10:19.200]  What if you approach this podcast with that attitude?
[10:19.340 --> 10:20.160]  How dare you?
[10:20.600 --> 10:23.860]  You better be all in on day 750 of regulation.
[10:24.820 --> 10:24.920]  Yeah.
[10:25.300 --> 10:27.060]  It's it's only an hour a week.
[10:27.260 --> 10:29.220]  I'm saying they probably do that all the time.
[10:29.760 --> 10:30.620]  Absolutely, they do.
[10:31.040 --> 10:32.720]  Your interview is so short, man.
[10:32.760 --> 10:33.160]  I don't know.
[10:33.180 --> 10:34.540]  It's like that's way less than an hour.
[10:34.660 --> 10:36.540]  So they should they should be able to get up for that.
[10:36.860 --> 10:37.820]  Yeah, five questions.
[10:38.380 --> 10:40.340]  Also, it's Gavin fucking free.
[10:40.500 --> 10:43.080]  How often do you get to talk to Gavin fucking free?
[10:43.220 --> 10:44.340]  About once every decade.
[10:44.660 --> 10:45.480]  That's what I'm saying.
[10:45.580 --> 10:46.700]  So Andrew has an idea.
[10:47.440 --> 10:48.940]  I should pitch you to other shows.
[10:49.100 --> 10:52.740]  I think I could find a better morning show for you to be on.
[10:53.080 --> 10:54.740]  Can I ask a question, Gavin, of you?
[10:54.920 --> 10:59.340]  How many morning shows have you appeared in throughout the entirety of your career?
[10:59.920 --> 11:00.760]  Less than 10.
[11:01.240 --> 11:01.860]  Less than 10.
[11:02.180 --> 11:04.020]  OK, so can we just say eight then?
[11:04.100 --> 11:04.640]  Does that seem OK?
[11:04.840 --> 11:05.060]  Sure.
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.460]  What do you think the record for most morning show appearances is?
[11:08.780 --> 11:10.200]  And can we make you break it?
[11:10.740 --> 11:11.460]  I don't know.
[11:12.040 --> 11:15.620]  What if Gavin just becomes the morning appearance guy?
[11:15.680 --> 11:19.480]  He's like he's like that dude that brings out like baby kittens and leopards and shit.
[11:20.840 --> 11:24.020]  I feel like Jerry O'Connell has done a lot of morning shows.
[11:24.580 --> 11:27.060]  Yeah, would I be freelance across multiple shows?
[11:27.320 --> 11:30.860]  Could I? It could be like a really like how Howard Stern is the king of all media
[11:31.460 --> 11:32.760]  or the king of old media.
[11:33.260 --> 11:36.020]  And I could be the king of breakfast appearances.
[11:36.380 --> 11:36.720]  Yeah.
[11:37.240 --> 11:41.980]  What if we structured one day where it was different time zones in different countries
[11:41.980 --> 11:45.100]  and you just keep hitting back to back to back mornings?
[11:45.400 --> 11:46.380]  Morning all day?
[11:46.720 --> 11:47.820]  Morning all day.
[11:48.440 --> 11:49.540]  Dude, I love that.
[11:49.880 --> 11:50.760]  Gavin's morning all day?
[11:51.040 --> 11:52.460]  Gavin's the all day brekkie boy.
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.200]  Oh, a brekkie boy.
[11:56.140 --> 12:02.160]  If you just kept moving around the earth, can you stay inside a morning for like a week straight?
[12:02.660 --> 12:04.420]  I would think so.
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.340]  You just have to cross the dateline at the right time.
[12:07.520 --> 12:07.780]  Yeah.
[12:08.120 --> 12:11.820]  For it to be morning if like if you took off at 11 a.m. and landed
[12:11.820 --> 12:15.840]  earlier some morning of the next day, that might be tough.
[12:16.380 --> 12:20.200]  You'd never need a lunch menu. It saves so much time.
[12:21.540 --> 12:27.080]  I wonder if I was living in mornings for a week, would I want to go through the motions
[12:27.080 --> 12:31.520]  of lunch and dinner or would I just feel so morningy that I keep ordering breakfasts?
[12:31.840 --> 12:33.540]  That's such an interesting question.
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.820]  I feel like I'd get sick of breakfast pretty quick as much as I love breakfast.
[12:38.280 --> 12:41.440]  Yeah, three times a day we'd get old after day two.
[12:41.700 --> 12:44.420]  I don't think I could do pancakes three times a day.
[12:45.060 --> 12:46.680]  Well, you'd probably want to mix up the breakfast.
[12:46.960 --> 12:48.300]  You can have a waffle in there somewhere.
[12:48.300 --> 12:52.560]  Yeah, I'd probably go pancake, waffle. Oh, do I go waffle for day?
[12:52.800 --> 12:56.720]  See, this is where it gets tough. But day two, you do four meals.
[12:57.360 --> 12:58.040]  Oh, God.
[12:58.200 --> 12:58.600]  It's over.
[12:59.020 --> 13:03.860]  This is a perfect fucking segue for something I want to try with you guys that I have been
[13:04.540 --> 13:09.680]  holding on to for ever. It's been on my notes forever.
[13:09.800 --> 13:12.140]  But I'm going to Google it real fast to fucking find it.
[13:12.320 --> 13:13.920]  OK, you pull it up while you do that.
[13:13.980 --> 13:17.300]  Gavin, can I be can I have a trial run as your booking agent?
[13:17.300 --> 13:20.540]  I can run some options by you, potentially see if there's any other.
[13:20.840 --> 13:22.100]  What's your percentage?
[13:22.820 --> 13:24.720]  Zero. I don't want any money for this.
[13:25.040 --> 13:25.380]  Wow.
[13:25.920 --> 13:29.500]  That's good, because I've never once been paid to appear on television.
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.280]  Really? You didn't get... that's wild to me. I'm surprised.
[13:33.700 --> 13:37.400]  I don't think they... do they usually pay people? I don't think I can charge for that.
[13:38.080 --> 13:40.200]  I feel like you should. You're giving up your time.
[13:40.400 --> 13:44.160]  It's an appearance fee. Bernie even pays you to be on Morning Somewhere, doesn't he?
[13:46.720 --> 13:49.840]  I would say you're going to let you're going to let Andrew do this.
[13:50.060 --> 13:53.080]  I think I should. I mean, I did just go on that long rant of
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.580]  how I don't want him to be in charge of anything.
[13:54.580 --> 13:57.360]  But I think I would put you in charge of my appearances.
[13:57.640 --> 13:59.760]  It can just be a trial run. It can just be a trial run.
[13:59.920 --> 14:03.500]  It's a trial run. I'll pitch some. I'll see what I can do. We'll get back to this.
[14:03.660 --> 14:05.720]  I'll throw some appearances at you.
[14:05.900 --> 14:08.520]  Jeff just posted spaghetti pancakes.
[14:08.980 --> 14:09.920]  Yeah, pancakes, spaghetti.
[14:10.100 --> 14:12.860]  Let's say you're on a flight and you're racing the international
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.160]  dateline and you're trying to have it be morning.
[14:15.340 --> 14:18.060]  So all you can eat is breakfast, breakfast, lunch and dinner.
[14:18.160 --> 14:18.600]  Wow.
[14:18.700 --> 14:22.840]  For dinner, why not have your pancakes spaghetti style?
[14:23.140 --> 14:27.140]  There's a TikTok I saw a while ago about where they use like a,
[14:27.140 --> 14:31.240]  you know, like a squirter to squirt the pancakes out into thin strips.
[14:31.340 --> 14:32.940]  And then it basically becomes spaghetti.
[14:33.320 --> 14:36.440]  And then you cook it up like that, flip it over, get everything cooked.
[14:36.440 --> 14:38.300]  And then you just put like your, you know,
[14:38.300 --> 14:41.380]  maple syrup or your powdered sugar or whatever on it.
[14:41.380 --> 14:43.440]  And you eat it spaghetti style.
[14:43.680 --> 14:47.300]  So it's like if you want your entire pancake to taste like the little
[14:47.300 --> 14:50.020]  dreggy smears that are attached to your normal pancakes.
[14:50.340 --> 14:50.800]  Yeah. Yeah.
[14:51.420 --> 14:54.200]  Or if you want like super crispy pancake, you know.
[14:55.680 --> 14:56.120]  Interesting.
[14:56.600 --> 14:59.040]  It's a different take on an old favorite.
[14:59.660 --> 15:02.180]  Could you do like spaghetti shredded potato, maybe?
[15:02.880 --> 15:03.120]  Maybe.
[15:03.280 --> 15:04.480]  You could just extend the shred.
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.400]  I think that would be really good.
[15:06.540 --> 15:10.780]  Anything that you can turn into spaghetti, you can turn into spaghetti, I think.
[15:12.140 --> 15:17.640]  I wonder if you could spaghetti bread and have like a spaghetti sandwich with
[15:17.640 --> 15:19.720]  spaghetti bread and spaghetti ham.
[15:19.840 --> 15:22.220]  So you're just making like a whole spaghetti meal.
[15:22.460 --> 15:25.360]  Like what you have for lunch is spaghetti, but it's like ham sandwich.
[15:25.920 --> 15:27.800]  But you can potentially pick it up like a sandwich still.
[15:27.900 --> 15:29.380]  You just be holding all spaghetti.
[15:30.020 --> 15:34.580]  Oh, there's something so gross about having a handful of spaghetti sandwich.
[15:35.160 --> 15:36.020]  Hey, you know what?
[15:36.140 --> 15:38.180]  We have a kitchen to try it out in now.
[15:38.600 --> 15:40.340]  That's true. We can definitely give this a shot.
[15:40.340 --> 15:43.040]  We would just need... how would we get a long string of ham?
[15:44.180 --> 15:46.360]  Cut it really like a spiral thing?
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.540]  We'll get like a... go on down to the Honeybake Ham store and eat some lunch while we're there
[15:51.540 --> 15:53.040]  because they have fucking ham sandwiches for lunch.
[15:53.140 --> 15:53.820]  Pretty fucking solid.
[15:54.040 --> 15:57.140]  And then we'll pick up a big ass spiral ham and then we'll just cut it right.
[15:57.560 --> 15:58.600]  Now, hear me out.
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.700]  I think we could get what this thing is called the Johnny Apple Peeler.
[16:06.560 --> 16:08.900]  And we just do that with ham, right?
[16:09.160 --> 16:09.740]  Ham that.
[16:09.740 --> 16:13.220]  I want to see a ham on a Johnny Apple Peeler so bad.
[16:13.400 --> 16:17.320]  But we get we get that with like bread. We do it with cheese.
[16:17.400 --> 16:19.840]  We do it with like everything that you would want.
[16:19.900 --> 16:20.100]  Yeah.
[16:20.280 --> 16:23.940]  If you'll buy us the Johnny Apple Peeler, I'll source the ham.
[16:24.300 --> 16:26.600]  So it's like a food lathe.
[16:26.700 --> 16:28.520]  Do we have to make the ham spherical first?
[16:29.000 --> 16:30.540]  We'll have to cut it down a little bit, I think.
[16:30.600 --> 16:30.740]  Yeah.
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.160]  Yeah, that's OK. We'll do some ham shaving.
[16:32.460 --> 16:34.800]  Should I get the suction base or the clamp base?
[16:36.940 --> 16:38.640]  Clamp base probably for safety.
[16:38.640 --> 16:40.620]  Yeah, we'll put it we can put it on the island.
[16:40.820 --> 16:43.000]  OK, I have it. The suction sucks. Don't do it.
[16:43.060 --> 16:43.920]  You have one of these?
[16:44.340 --> 16:44.660]  Yeah.
[16:45.040 --> 16:46.220]  We'll definitely listen to him then.
[16:46.700 --> 16:47.660]  Yeah, he's an expert.
[16:48.420 --> 16:48.780]  Guess so.
[16:48.780 --> 16:50.860]  Dude, ham spaghetti is going to be fucking delicious.
[16:51.720 --> 16:54.480]  I like the idea of this being almost like a spinoff of does it do?
[16:54.560 --> 16:57.380]  And it's just does it spaghetti and you just put things in the thing.
[16:57.680 --> 17:00.120]  I've had I've had.
[17:00.280 --> 17:01.860]  We were go go for it.
[17:01.880 --> 17:02.220]  Go for it.
[17:02.220 --> 17:06.420]  I was gonna say I've had that link in my in my notes since November, I think.
[17:06.440 --> 17:07.080]  Oh, that's awesome.
[17:07.260 --> 17:08.420]  We were trying to find a way to bring.
[17:08.420 --> 17:14.080]  We were getting stuff moved out that we had kept in storage to get to like the new space.
[17:16.060 --> 17:20.760]  And Gavin had the does it do paintings that you guys made.
[17:20.860 --> 17:23.380]  And those are going to be hanging in the in the new office.
[17:23.580 --> 17:24.400]  That's crazy.
[17:24.820 --> 17:25.440]  Yeah, we kept them.
[17:25.820 --> 17:26.220]  Unbelievable.
[17:26.660 --> 17:28.520]  It's amazing how much shit there was.
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.900]  Did you guys film the throwing of the patch on a shirt at distance?
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.080]  Is there video of that?
[17:34.560 --> 17:34.840]  Yes.
[17:35.380 --> 17:36.540]  Yeah, Gavin has it, I think.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.520]  I have it. It's on my phone.
[17:37.520 --> 17:39.960]  Yeah, OK. As you say, I filmed it on somebody else's phone, though.
[17:40.240 --> 17:42.700]  Someone should post that because I want to see it.
[17:42.800 --> 17:43.700]  Oh, maybe it was on Gavin's phone.
[17:44.220 --> 17:45.380]  I thought I filmed it, but.
[17:45.420 --> 17:47.420]  We should get that up there because that sounds amazing.
[17:47.660 --> 17:50.840]  Maybe you did film it because you were you were throwing the patch on me.
[17:50.920 --> 17:52.120]  That's what it was. You did film it.
[17:52.500 --> 17:54.600]  OK, that's exactly what it was because I was wearing the shirt.
[17:54.980 --> 17:58.480]  Well, then there's a good chance I hit record after I should have stopped or
[17:59.460 --> 18:00.400]  filmed our feet.
[18:00.720 --> 18:03.220]  But now would you call that the video being corrupted?
[18:04.160 --> 18:06.340]  No, I'd call that me being me.
[18:06.740 --> 18:09.220]  The video getting getting Jeffed.
[18:09.220 --> 18:10.380]  Jeff, I'm going to take that.
[18:10.480 --> 18:12.900]  That'll that saves a lot of time for me.
[18:14.220 --> 18:16.380]  I guess we had a word. It's salad cream, right?
[18:16.760 --> 18:17.500]  Yeah, essentially.
[18:17.640 --> 18:18.160]  Or Gregg.
[18:19.280 --> 18:20.160]  Gregged it. Yeah.
[18:20.680 --> 18:24.720]  Speaking of speaking of getting Gregged, man, I got fucking Gregged at McDonald's today.
[18:25.140 --> 18:26.660]  You got Gregged at McDonald's?
[18:26.720 --> 18:29.680]  I had to go maybe just salad cream, but I was fucking annoyed.
[18:29.860 --> 18:32.300]  I had to go up and get some meds for the dog
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.000]  on the other side of town back where I used to live,
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.800]  which is where the McDonald's I used to always fight with was.
[18:37.340 --> 18:40.720]  And I thought for old time's sake, maybe I'll swing by my old McDonald's to get some breakfast.
[18:41.200 --> 18:45.240]  I get into the drive through and I tried to make it as simple as possible as I always do.
[18:45.280 --> 18:48.660]  And I just said, I'll take a number four with cheese and diet Coke.
[18:49.020 --> 18:51.760]  And she goes, we don't have any soda today.
[18:52.800 --> 18:53.820]  And that's all she said.
[18:53.900 --> 18:55.320]  Like there was no like follow up to that.
[18:55.360 --> 18:57.540]  And I went, I waited for a while, just silence.
[18:59.080 --> 19:00.540]  Can I get orange juice?
[19:00.900 --> 19:02.140]  And she goes, OK.
[19:02.960 --> 19:06.700]  And then she goes, number four, sir, number four doesn't come with cheese.
[19:07.380 --> 19:09.580]  And I go, yeah, that's why I requested cheese.
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.060]  That's why I requested the cheese.
[19:11.100 --> 19:14.240]  I'm trying to add the cheese to it, which by the way, a number four in breakfast
[19:14.240 --> 19:18.720]  is just a fucking sausage biscuit, sausage egg biscuit.
[19:19.040 --> 19:21.780]  And the number three is the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit.
[19:21.980 --> 19:24.600]  Why the fuck doesn't sausage get cheese by default?
[19:24.820 --> 19:27.260]  Why do I have to add cheese to it every fucking time?
[19:27.580 --> 19:28.700]  Bacon gets free cheese.
[19:28.900 --> 19:30.280]  Why doesn't sausage get free cheese?
[19:30.280 --> 19:32.240]  Makes no goddamn sense, McDonald's.
[19:32.320 --> 19:34.660]  But anyway, that was hyper aggressive the way she said it.
[19:34.720 --> 19:35.560]  Sir, it doesn't.
[19:35.660 --> 19:37.740]  And she and I was like, well, that's why I'm requesting cheese.
[19:37.800 --> 19:38.820]  I'd like to add the cheese to it.
[19:38.860 --> 19:39.940]  And she goes, she gets really, she goes.
[19:41.260 --> 19:44.160]  And then I pull around, doesn't even look at me,
[19:44.220 --> 19:46.000]  takes my money or whatever, sends me to the next thing.
[19:46.320 --> 19:50.920]  I come up to the lady and she goes, we can't get to the orange juice right now.
[19:51.800 --> 19:52.120]  What?
[19:52.920 --> 19:55.480]  She goes, it's hard to get to the orange juice right now.
[19:55.560 --> 19:56.940]  Do you want lemonade instead?
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.120]  And I was like, I fucking guess.
[20:00.400 --> 20:06.720]  And so I ended up with my third choice for drink when I went to McDonald's today.
[20:07.240 --> 20:09.420]  And I got sass for asking for fucking cheese.
[20:09.580 --> 20:13.840]  So they got, I assume, a delivery and they have to sell their way to the orange juice.
[20:13.960 --> 20:14.780]  I don't know.
[20:14.840 --> 20:16.760]  I don't know what was going on in there, man.
[20:17.120 --> 20:19.140]  But she was like, it's hard to get to right now.
[20:20.080 --> 20:21.740]  I don't want your job to be hard.
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.900]  Give me whatever's available, I guess.
[20:23.940 --> 20:25.880]  And why do you have lemonade but not soda?
[20:25.880 --> 20:27.140]  They come into the same fucking machine.
[20:27.220 --> 20:28.240]  But OK, that's cool.
[20:28.660 --> 20:31.080]  They're running a McDonald's like a game of solitaire.
[20:31.140 --> 20:33.860]  Dude, every time I go to that McDonald's, it's oof.
[20:34.160 --> 20:35.200]  It's a blueprints puzzle.
[20:35.460 --> 20:36.180]  They need the RNG.
[20:36.360 --> 20:38.180]  They just can't get the orange juice to drop.
[20:38.240 --> 20:39.500]  But we do got lemonade, sir.
[20:40.480 --> 20:44.160]  I like that McDonald's because at that McDonald's, the customers always, fuck you.
[20:46.440 --> 20:47.760]  So you got the cheese at least?
[20:48.020 --> 20:50.400]  I got the cheese and it was fucking delicious.
[20:50.980 --> 20:55.980]  They are no, no shade to the cooks who put that together because they did a phenomenal job.
[20:56.060 --> 20:56.920]  And I'll be honest with you.
[20:57.120 --> 20:57.860]  Lemonade was great.
[20:58.280 --> 20:59.080]  Wasn't what I wanted.
[20:59.320 --> 21:01.960]  Wasn't the replacement for what I wanted, but it was good.
[21:02.220 --> 21:05.960]  Weren't you saying how when we got burgers the other day, it had been so long since you
[21:05.960 --> 21:06.580]  had fast food?
[21:06.920 --> 21:10.280]  Yeah, it had been a long time since I had fast food when we did that.
[21:10.400 --> 21:12.320]  But yeah, I ripped that Band-Aid off.
[21:13.120 --> 21:14.280]  I got that McDonald's.
[21:14.640 --> 21:18.760]  I had Jersey Mike's yesterday and I had McDonald's for breakfast today.
[21:19.200 --> 21:19.680]  Look at that.
[21:19.680 --> 21:22.600]  Make your next vacation unforgettable.
[21:23.220 --> 21:26.700]  On Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.

[22:04.980 --> 22:05.880]  Deliciously popped.
[22:06.500 --> 22:07.380]  Perfectly salted.
[22:08.080 --> 22:08.640]  Skinny Pop.
[22:08.860 --> 22:10.160]  Popular for a reason.
[22:10.860 --> 22:12.020]  Shop Skinny Pop now.
[22:13.580 --> 22:16.240]  I want to know about what's going on with this TV
[22:16.240 --> 22:19.160]  because I keep hearing about a TV in relation to the office
[22:19.160 --> 22:20.980]  and there's something that's occurred.
[22:21.900 --> 22:25.940]  Geoff and I went shopping and then we put the TV in the office.
[22:25.940 --> 22:28.440]  Well, can I preface? Can I just take it back a second?
[22:28.660 --> 22:28.760]  Yeah.
[22:28.860 --> 22:32.820]  Eric and I rented a U-Haul a couple, I guess last week at this point.
[22:33.680 --> 22:37.020]  And we needed that because we had a bunch of stuff to pick up.
[22:37.060 --> 22:38.720]  We wanted to get stuff from Gavin's studio.
[22:39.140 --> 22:42.800]  We wanted to go pick up stuff from Tina and Ray
[22:42.800 --> 22:45.820]  that they were giving us some extra stuff that they had.
[22:46.280 --> 22:48.560]  And then we also... where else did we go, Eric?
[22:48.640 --> 22:50.180]  We had to go to some third location too.
[22:50.260 --> 22:52.900]  We had to go to my house where Kitchen Island was delivered.
[22:53.400 --> 22:54.700]  That's right. We had to go to your house for Kitchen Island.
[22:54.820 --> 22:56.740]  So we basically were in the U-Haul all day.
[22:56.800 --> 22:58.640]  The heaviest fucking thing too.
[22:59.020 --> 23:00.460]  So heavy getting that thing to the car.
[23:00.760 --> 23:00.960]  It was fucked.
[23:00.960 --> 23:03.820]  We definitely saved heaviest and shittiest for last,
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.580]  which in retrospect was maybe not the best idea.
[23:06.840 --> 23:08.380]  But while we're out driving around, I go,
[23:08.460 --> 23:10.780]  hey man, we need to get a TV for the office,
[23:10.780 --> 23:12.200]  for like the co-op room and everything.
[23:12.700 --> 23:15.040]  We should just go to Costco and pick one up while we have the U-Haul.
[23:15.040 --> 23:16.040]  And Eric's like, I don't want to do that.
[23:16.120 --> 23:16.740]  It's a long way away.
[23:16.840 --> 23:18.620]  I don't know. And I'm like, I know, but we have the U-Haul.
[23:18.840 --> 23:20.100]  Now would be the time to do it.
[23:20.120 --> 23:21.060]  And he's like, we'll deal with it later.
[23:21.180 --> 23:22.080]  So I was like, okay.
[23:22.860 --> 23:24.460]  You Gavin, you can frame this.
[23:24.680 --> 23:24.980]  Shut up.
[23:25.160 --> 23:27.280]  You can frame this however you want.
[23:27.920 --> 23:31.360]  A hundred inch TV is fucking psycho behavior.
[23:31.860 --> 23:33.160]  That nobody has got an inch.
[23:33.620 --> 23:34.260]  Nobody bought.
[23:34.500 --> 23:36.140]  First off, nobody bought a hundred inch TV.
[23:36.640 --> 23:36.960]  Okay.
[23:37.560 --> 23:40.360]  I saw one and I said that there was one available on sale.
[23:40.480 --> 23:41.260]  We didn't buy one.
[23:41.260 --> 23:48.160]  Did you know that you can get a 98 inch TV at Costco for like 1100 bucks or something?
[23:48.880 --> 23:49.680]  That's ridiculous.
[23:50.440 --> 23:51.880]  There's a better photo that Gavin has.
[23:52.180 --> 23:54.120]  It's too big to fit on the wall.
[23:54.620 --> 23:56.100]  So Gavin, technically, yes.
[23:56.240 --> 24:00.020]  So Gavin and I, we were hanging out the next day, putting stuff together.
[24:00.140 --> 24:02.820]  I was putting chairs together and he was building shelves and stuff.
[24:03.000 --> 24:06.800]  And we thought, hey, why don't we go get Emily's SUV?
[24:07.000 --> 24:07.820]  Cause she's got a bigger car.
[24:08.220 --> 24:10.720]  And we'll just go to Costco and pick up a TV and bring it back.
[24:10.720 --> 24:11.700]  Because we're going to need one.
[24:12.060 --> 24:13.600]  At this point, we've already used it for the live stream.
[24:13.760 --> 24:15.280]  It's an integral piece of technology.
[24:16.020 --> 24:20.020]  And it's one of the hanging chads we have out there that still isn't in process.
[24:21.060 --> 24:22.400]  Computer equipment's already been ordered.
[24:22.660 --> 24:23.780]  Sound equipment's already been ordered.
[24:24.040 --> 24:25.040]  Furniture's all already been ordered.
[24:25.200 --> 24:28.460]  But there's a few odds and ends like the TV that is just sitting out there.
[24:28.860 --> 24:30.620]  And so we drove over to Costco.
[24:31.200 --> 24:31.920]  And we got to Costco.
[24:32.060 --> 24:32.580]  And I was smart.
[24:32.780 --> 24:35.140]  I brought a tape measure.
[24:35.800 --> 24:38.260]  And we laid the back of the SUV down.
[24:38.260 --> 24:41.720]  And I measured the width inside from wall to wall.
[24:41.820 --> 24:43.120]  It was 43 inches.
[24:43.660 --> 24:48.680]  And so I told Gavin, we can buy a TV as big as 43 inches wide.
[24:49.660 --> 24:50.000]  Or high.
[24:50.280 --> 24:51.060]  Or high, yeah.
[24:51.400 --> 24:58.600]  And then we went and we measured every TV until we found a TV that was 43 inches high.
[24:58.920 --> 25:05.800]  Now, you may have immediately noticed the problem in that the packaging is going to be much bigger
[25:05.800 --> 25:06.360]  than the TV.
[25:06.660 --> 25:07.120]  Yeah, yeah.
[25:07.120 --> 25:10.240]  You know, aren't the packages out there with the TVs?
[25:10.460 --> 25:11.420]  It's not just the TVs.
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.440]  And you guys were just measuring the TVs then?
[25:13.980 --> 25:14.680]  But here's why.
[25:15.000 --> 25:20.560]  Because we knew if we took the TV out of the packaging, it would fit.
[25:21.500 --> 25:22.880]  Who needs the packaging?
[25:23.040 --> 25:24.200]  We're not saving the packaging.
[25:24.620 --> 25:26.260]  It's just a thing we got to throw away later, right?
[25:26.500 --> 25:33.580]  So we bought the TV that was 43 inches tall to fit into a space that was exactly 43 inches wide.
[25:34.060 --> 25:37.720]  Which, in retrospect, maybe we could have given ourselves an inch of leeway there.
[25:38.900 --> 25:41.140]  Also, at no point did we measure depth.
[25:41.960 --> 25:43.040]  That became an issue.
[25:44.360 --> 25:48.820]  And we go out into the park a lot and we don't have any tools.
[25:48.940 --> 25:50.040]  They didn't have any tools at Costco.
[25:50.400 --> 25:52.820]  So we didn't have any tools to take the TV out of the packaging.
[25:52.880 --> 25:54.760]  It's got like those plastic bands around it and shit.
[25:55.180 --> 25:59.580]  But I remembered that Emily had just bought this thing on Amazon where if you get...
[25:59.580 --> 26:05.360]  your card sinks into a pool or a river, you can like pop the window out and it's got the little
[26:05.360 --> 26:07.280]  thing that cuts the seatbelt.
[26:07.900 --> 26:09.020]  And so I grabbed that.
[26:09.660 --> 26:11.100]  We used it to cut...
[26:11.100 --> 26:12.640]  I put a picture in Slack of this package.
[26:13.200 --> 26:14.160]  Oh my god.
[26:15.560 --> 26:16.140]  It's so big.
[26:16.140 --> 26:17.280]  Is it too powerful for Discord?
[26:17.520 --> 26:18.040]  Hold on, let me look.
[26:18.420 --> 26:19.500]  Way too powerful for Discord.
[26:21.100 --> 26:21.980]  And so...
[26:21.980 --> 26:24.540]  By the way, the TV size we were able to get was 86 inches.
[26:25.060 --> 26:26.700]  And so we...
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.360]  Jesus Christ.
[26:29.940 --> 26:31.600]  We take it completely apart.
[26:32.300 --> 26:37.880]  Somehow, taking a TV out of a packaging makes the packaging way bigger than it was when it was all together.
[26:38.040 --> 26:39.800]  There's so much packaging everywhere.
[26:39.920 --> 26:41.300]  So much styrofoam packaging ever.
[26:41.880 --> 26:42.760]  And the TV...
[26:42.760 --> 26:48.260]  The TV is so heavy and unwieldy because it doesn't have legs on it or anything, right?
[26:48.300 --> 26:50.160]  And if it did, we'd have to take them off because they wouldn't fit.
[26:50.700 --> 26:55.160]  And so we get it sideways, finally, outside of all the packaging, which is next to impossible
[26:55.160 --> 26:56.700]  because there's nothing to put it on other than the ground.
[26:56.780 --> 26:58.260]  It was a whole fucking thing, right?
[26:58.260 --> 27:01.740]  Just a whole nightmare of a thing that we were having a delight doing.
[27:01.900 --> 27:03.120]  By the way, I was having time in my life.
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.760]  Then we were able to get the TV sideways, get it up onto the car.
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.260]  86-inch TV weighs almost as much as a kitchen island, it turns out.
[27:12.620 --> 27:14.380]  And we get it shoved in.
[27:14.660 --> 27:15.560]  There's about...
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.080]  I don't know, Gav.
[27:16.100 --> 27:16.540]  What do you say?
[27:16.660 --> 27:18.680]  Like six inches of TV sticking out of the back?
[27:21.160 --> 27:24.800]  Yeah, we didn't take into account the thickness of the door.
[27:25.400 --> 27:25.660]  Yeah.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.520]  And so...
[27:28.280 --> 27:32.780]  We had to move both of the front seats as far forward as they would go,
[27:33.240 --> 27:36.140]  and then forward, and then wedge the TV in,
[27:36.300 --> 27:40.940]  and then honestly slam the car door on it and hope it didn't break.
[27:41.260 --> 27:42.720]  I put another picture in Slack.
[27:42.960 --> 27:44.480]  It made a noise, but it didn't break.
[27:44.940 --> 27:45.840]  Oh, no.
[27:48.360 --> 27:49.740]  Oh, yeah, you can see.
[27:51.860 --> 27:55.180]  We were squashed up against the dashboard.
[27:56.920 --> 27:57.960]  So then...
[27:59.660 --> 28:01.220]  Oh, this is the dumbest part.
[28:01.620 --> 28:03.880]  So then we had a whole box worth of TV trash.
[28:04.360 --> 28:06.480]  And I was like, Gav, what do we do with all this trash?
[28:06.500 --> 28:08.140]  And I was like, I genuinely don't know.
[28:08.320 --> 28:10.560]  I didn't get that far in my head buying the TV.
[28:10.720 --> 28:11.940]  I just thought we'd take it out.
[28:12.240 --> 28:14.180]  And the car is full of TV, right?
[28:14.280 --> 28:17.100]  And so we look around and we try to put it all back together.
[28:17.180 --> 28:18.760]  And I'm like, there's got to be a dumpster or something.
[28:18.980 --> 28:21.140]  And we can't find anything and we can't fit it.
[28:21.220 --> 28:26.120]  And so we just put it all in back on the cart and kind of put it over out of the way.
[28:26.160 --> 28:27.500]  And then we just left.
[28:27.500 --> 28:31.820]  And then about three seconds on the road, we looked at each other and went,
[28:32.240 --> 28:33.800]  we can't be... we can't do that.
[28:33.900 --> 28:34.400]  That's terrible.
[28:34.620 --> 28:35.840]  We're going to ruin somebody's day.
[28:36.120 --> 28:37.920]  Well, I wanted to tell us like an employee.
[28:38.040 --> 28:40.380]  I'd be like, is there a place we could dump it?
[28:40.740 --> 28:44.100]  Or... so then we were driving around looking and then we would just like at the exit.
[28:44.320 --> 28:46.120]  We had to make a real split decision.
[28:46.400 --> 28:48.560]  So we left and then we're like, no, no, no, we can't.
[28:48.620 --> 28:49.040]  We can't do it.
[28:49.080 --> 28:50.860]  So we turned around and we came back in.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.880]  And on the way back in, we found a dumpster at another store.
[28:54.080 --> 28:57.340]  So we went back to where we left the TV box and we took it apart.
[28:57.500 --> 29:00.460]  Piece by piece and slid it all into the car.
[29:00.620 --> 29:03.740]  You can see it hanging out of our heads there and then drove over to a dumpster
[29:03.740 --> 29:05.320]  and then put it all in the dumpster.
[29:05.660 --> 29:08.840]  And then we had five guys and holy shit, five guys is expensive.
[29:09.120 --> 29:10.580]  Dude, we did the maths on it.
[29:10.620 --> 29:11.780]  We had two burgers, right?
[29:11.800 --> 29:13.760]  And it came to, I think like $50.
[29:14.980 --> 29:15.740]  That's insane.
[29:15.840 --> 29:18.420]  Yeah, it was $50 and like 45 cents.
[29:18.840 --> 29:23.200]  That means like a burger is it's like a 40th of a TV.
[29:23.200 --> 29:28.240]  If we had that meal, we could have had that meal 20 times
[29:28.240 --> 29:30.280]  before we'd spent as much money on the TV.
[29:30.600 --> 29:35.340]  Should a TV be like 20 burgers, not 40 or like 200 burgers?
[29:35.480 --> 29:38.220]  I mean, I think that's the problem with the world is that
[29:38.220 --> 29:42.320]  you can buy all this massive shit, but the actual day to day,
[29:42.460 --> 29:44.920]  the lunches is what's doing everyone in.
[29:45.380 --> 29:47.440]  I should be able to have 200 burgers per TV.
[29:48.540 --> 29:49.580]  I'm right there with you.
[29:49.640 --> 29:51.560]  The burger conversion doesn't work, dude.
[29:51.620 --> 29:52.480]  It's like, what do we get?
[29:52.480 --> 29:56.600]  We got two bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of fries and two sodas.
[29:56.820 --> 29:59.820]  Yeah, we're buying a TV that's like less than $10 an inch.
[29:59.820 --> 30:01.820]  So you got this at Costco, right?
[30:02.240 --> 30:03.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[30:03.120 --> 30:09.440]  Oh man, I would be so anxious trying to load that in the car of a Costco parking lot.
[30:09.700 --> 30:12.900]  Just filled with people, people wanting your space.
[30:13.720 --> 30:15.280]  That sounds terrible.
[30:16.020 --> 30:19.680]  Oh, dude, it was we were playing dickhead calisthenics without even trying
[30:19.680 --> 30:22.380]  because they were cars, Pat, like Gavin saw firsthand.
[30:22.560 --> 30:23.260]  There were cars waiting.
[30:23.340 --> 30:25.860]  They would just sit and watch us for like 20 seconds and then give up and leave.
[30:26.900 --> 30:29.160]  Because we were out there for a fucking while.
[30:29.500 --> 30:30.560]  It would take so long.
[30:30.900 --> 30:32.740]  I might cut a little video of our process.
[30:32.980 --> 30:36.800]  I would love to see physically loading it in, but all of this because I was helping carry it,
[30:36.860 --> 30:39.440]  but all the stuff around it, we've got, I've documented it.
[30:40.820 --> 30:43.900]  It took two minutes to buy and 20 minutes to get it in the car,
[30:44.460 --> 30:45.520]  but it fucking worked.
[30:45.640 --> 30:48.800]  And then we got it back to the office and we put it in the spot where
[30:48.800 --> 30:50.060]  everybody knew the TV would go.
[30:50.220 --> 30:53.500]  And it's it's like four inches bigger than the wall.
[30:53.580 --> 30:57.300]  Maybe hangs out into the doorway or you won't be able to open the closet.
[30:57.660 --> 30:58.640]  So what happened there?
[30:58.720 --> 31:01.440]  Did you guys measure the wall as part of your...
[31:03.020 --> 31:03.800]  We measured it after.
[31:04.180 --> 31:05.960]  Yeah, we measured it after we saw it was too big.
[31:06.600 --> 31:10.660]  I love I love that you had the 43 inch thing that you were like locked in on,
[31:10.680 --> 31:11.780]  but you didn't measure the wall.
[31:11.880 --> 31:14.060]  I feel like that's the important thing for.
[31:15.000 --> 31:16.700]  The important thing was to get it back.
[31:16.700 --> 31:20.300]  I guess, yeah, like that's how the TV fits in that space.
[31:20.760 --> 31:22.300]  Yeah, you can see it hanging over.
[31:23.920 --> 31:26.800]  And it's just resting on the console table.
[31:27.040 --> 31:27.800]  It's so ridiculous.
[31:28.360 --> 31:29.120]  The legs don't.
[31:29.540 --> 31:33.580]  Yeah, it's not a center stand either so it doesn't even fit on the table.
[31:34.100 --> 31:39.760]  But the thing that I noticed is that you guys also bought a wall mount.
[31:41.240 --> 31:43.280]  Yeah, what are we going to balance on that table?
[31:43.860 --> 31:45.940]  What's the plan with the wall mount?
[31:45.940 --> 31:50.380]  Well, we can either shimmy into the room or we can leave the closet door open.
[31:51.940 --> 31:52.900]  That's the plan?
[31:53.560 --> 31:55.420]  Or we can mount it to a different wall.
[31:55.780 --> 31:56.740]  There's the wall to the right.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.580]  Yeah, there's a less funny option of putting it on the other wall.
[32:00.140 --> 32:00.640]  It's up to you.
[32:00.860 --> 32:03.560]  It looks like Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall.
[32:03.740 --> 32:04.460]  It's going to fall.
[32:04.580 --> 32:06.080]  Its legs are just dangling.
[32:06.420 --> 32:07.560]  Oh yeah, that's not safe.
[32:07.600 --> 32:09.880]  We took that down the second with the photo shoot was over.
[32:10.240 --> 32:12.180]  That was just for y'all.
[32:12.580 --> 32:15.480]  And we watched a little bit of Total Wipeout with Hammond.
[32:15.480 --> 32:19.000]  With Richard Hammond in like 240p or whatever it was.
[32:19.120 --> 32:20.160]  Yeah, it looks great.
[32:20.980 --> 32:23.980]  The TV does, in fact, look better than that.
[32:24.040 --> 32:25.800]  That was that was the Hulu show we put on.
[32:26.320 --> 32:28.160]  This was my view of Jeff as we were.
[32:35.020 --> 32:38.380]  So the TV isn't in a finalized spot yet.
[32:38.500 --> 32:40.280]  We're still it's still being figured out.
[32:40.340 --> 32:42.500]  No, it's still still being figured out.
[32:42.680 --> 32:43.440]  That's crazy.
[32:43.440 --> 32:46.240]  We just wanted to make some real progress.
[32:46.560 --> 32:48.380]  And we and so we did.
[32:49.560 --> 32:51.840]  It's really exciting to have the progress.
[32:51.960 --> 32:56.620]  But it's so funny to me that you guys measured if it would fit in the car, but not the wall.
[32:56.860 --> 32:58.060]  Well, that seemed like the bottleneck.
[32:58.340 --> 33:02.600]  Yeah, could you imagine something worse than getting a cut the TV to the car and having it not fit?
[33:02.960 --> 33:04.080]  Then you're really screwed.
[33:04.500 --> 33:09.460]  I feel like there's what can you strap a can you strap a TV to the top of the car?
[33:10.060 --> 33:11.880]  I see it on TikTok all the time.
[33:11.960 --> 33:12.880]  Very rarely goes well.
[33:12.880 --> 33:14.680]  Oh, yeah, that's true.
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.680]  We were actually trying to milk the inches even more and then we decided against it.
[33:18.700 --> 33:22.900]  But we realized when we were measuring, we measured like horizontally the hole in the car
[33:22.900 --> 33:23.920]  that we could get the TV through.
[33:24.180 --> 33:28.440]  And then as we were measuring the height of TVs, Jeff was like, I mean, if we measured
[33:28.440 --> 33:32.820]  the hole in the car diagonally, we could get slightly more inches.
[33:33.220 --> 33:34.840]  But we didn't go that far.
[33:35.780 --> 33:37.180]  We wanted it to lie down flat.
[33:39.060 --> 33:40.320]  Yeah, instead of wedging it.
[33:40.320 --> 33:43.120]  But I think we could have got an 88 in there, a push.
[33:43.360 --> 33:45.680]  It would have just been diagonally in the car.
[33:46.100 --> 33:48.420]  I just would have been a little more precarious.
[33:48.720 --> 33:52.740]  I think that I appreciate how conservative we went with it, Gavin.
[33:53.040 --> 33:55.540]  Yeah, I think we've I think we really reigned it in.
[33:55.760 --> 33:57.480]  Like it's big, but it's not too big.
[33:57.880 --> 33:59.000]  It's not comically big.
[33:59.420 --> 34:00.560]  Under a thousand dollars.
[34:01.040 --> 34:02.200]  Yeah, it was like 800 bucks.
[34:02.940 --> 34:03.780]  That's crazy.
[34:04.240 --> 34:04.560]  Wow.
[34:04.600 --> 34:08.120]  Which by also, by the way, fucking Costco doesn't take American Express.
[34:08.120 --> 34:09.420]  So the company owes me $800.
[34:12.060 --> 34:12.420]  Debatable.
[34:14.820 --> 34:15.700]  You're going to love that.
[34:15.860 --> 34:17.600]  Just going to take his TV and go home.
[34:17.940 --> 34:18.460]  I can't.
[34:18.580 --> 34:21.500]  If he can figure out how to get it back in that car.
[34:21.720 --> 34:22.060]  Absolutely.
[34:22.600 --> 34:22.960]  Too hard.
[34:23.560 --> 34:24.320]  I'll film it.
[34:24.700 --> 34:27.060]  No, what you'll do is you'll watch awesome stuff on the TV.
[34:27.480 --> 34:33.180]  You need to like strap suspenders to the back of it and throw it over your back
[34:33.180 --> 34:34.900]  and just walked in the street like a villain.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.840]  We could have spent so much more money on a TV.
[34:37.840 --> 34:40.480]  They get so expensive, but we were very...
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.480]  We walked past all the nice stuff, like all the OLEDs and all the modern refresh rates.
[34:47.660 --> 34:49.060]  We just went for size.
[34:50.400 --> 34:51.320]  Well, and for price.
[34:51.660 --> 34:55.620]  So this is going to be where like Mario Party is played, this TV.
[34:55.740 --> 34:57.360]  This is like the central gaming TV.
[34:57.820 --> 34:59.680]  Yeah, this is where it was played at this point.
[35:00.180 --> 35:00.440]  Okay.
[35:00.900 --> 35:06.760]  I always think about like when Halo 2 was new, I probably played 2500 games of Halo 2
[35:06.760 --> 35:12.240]  on a four by three, 14 inch TV with a VCR built into it.
[35:12.260 --> 35:16.640]  So the fact that you can play Mario Party on this, where each screen
[35:16.640 --> 35:21.360]  of a split screen is bigger than my TV, I love that.
[35:21.700 --> 35:25.300]  Yeah, it's I mean, the price TVs, it's crazy how it's...
[35:25.300 --> 35:28.460]  I remember spending essentially how much you guys paid
[35:28.460 --> 35:34.360]  for a mid tier 50 inch TV, like a little over a decade ago.
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.680]  But having to save up my money and being so excited of like, oh, this is a big purchase.
[35:38.860 --> 35:43.140]  And now just seeing like that you can get an 86 inch or whatever that is
[35:43.140 --> 35:44.920]  for the same price is insane.
[35:45.380 --> 35:53.060]  The first TV I bought myself was a 32 inch 720p Philips, and it was 900 pounds.
[35:53.720 --> 35:54.820]  Oh my God.
[35:55.100 --> 35:58.000]  Well, I remember Gavin, the first time we bought a TV together,
[35:58.040 --> 36:00.420]  we were talking about this the other day, you were visiting for the summer
[36:00.420 --> 36:03.580]  and I was finally ready to upgrade to a flat screen TV.
[36:03.580 --> 36:05.900]  And I bought at Best Buy, we went together.
[36:06.020 --> 36:10.960]  I think I bought a 36 inch TV, maybe or 40 inch.
[36:11.260 --> 36:13.040]  It was similar in size to your previous one.
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.200]  But it was, I think it was HD, right?
[36:15.300 --> 36:16.940]  It was HD and the other one was EDTV.
[36:17.460 --> 36:20.080]  And I want to say it was like 2700 bucks.
[36:20.420 --> 36:21.200]  Oh my God.
[36:21.320 --> 36:21.940]  That's crazy.
[36:22.240 --> 36:25.960]  I found a picture of the TV I played Halo 2 on.
[36:26.360 --> 36:28.660]  That boy, dude, that's a...
[36:29.320 --> 36:32.260]  That picture you could post anywhere on the internet.
[36:32.260 --> 36:35.280]  And it's just like nostalgia bait for people our age.
[36:35.380 --> 36:36.020]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:36.240 --> 36:37.080]  That's insane.
[36:37.540 --> 36:39.040]  I love the Jackass box set.
[36:39.220 --> 36:39.920]  Yeah, absolutely.
[36:40.620 --> 36:43.160]  I got chrome skin on my original Xbox.
[36:43.560 --> 36:44.040]  Wow.
[36:44.800 --> 36:45.940]  Hell yeah, you do.
[36:46.240 --> 36:47.540]  And the DVD remote.
[36:48.360 --> 36:50.800]  What is the, uh, what does that say at the top?
[36:50.820 --> 36:51.980]  Is that like a little name tag?
[36:52.180 --> 36:52.980]  Kind of like it, like...
[36:52.980 --> 36:55.300]  No, it says, it says Gavin's phone hands off.
[36:56.420 --> 36:57.280]  I don't know who bought that.
[36:57.820 --> 36:58.360]  Pretty cool.
[36:59.420 --> 37:00.300]  Pretty cool.
[37:01.660 --> 37:03.520]  I, uh, I have a serial killer update.
[37:04.100 --> 37:05.460]  Oh no, your house.
[37:06.180 --> 37:07.140]  Is there more carcasses?
[37:07.680 --> 37:08.680]  There have been two incidents.
[37:09.020 --> 37:15.580]  One, uh, I had, I, I can smell the scent of death around the side of my house,
[37:15.580 --> 37:18.520]  but I cannot find the location of the death.
[37:18.820 --> 37:22.940]  But something has definitely been decomposing somewhere on the side of my house and I just
[37:22.940 --> 37:23.740]  cannot locate it.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.340]  I'm also not looking too hard because it's fucking gross.
[37:26.340 --> 37:27.920]  Whatever, when I find it.
[37:27.980 --> 37:31.020]  But the other night, I think I may have seen the serial killer.
[37:31.700 --> 37:35.720]  At least, uh, certainly a, the first, uh, prime suspect.
[37:36.260 --> 37:39.120]  I went out and now I've unlocked a new fear in life too.
[37:39.460 --> 37:43.480]  I went out to throw some trash away in my trash can and I lifted the trash can up and
[37:43.480 --> 37:47.740]  I threw like, I don't know, a bag of food or something in there and something shifted
[37:47.740 --> 37:50.720]  when I did that and I just dropped the top and I thought, what the fuck?
[37:50.760 --> 37:53.380]  You know, I like took a step back for a second and I went, what the fuck?
[37:53.380 --> 37:59.660]  And right as I took a step back, the lid exploded open and the biggest, fattest raccoon I've
[37:59.660 --> 38:05.080]  ever seen in my life scrambled out, looked at me, jumped over the edge and slowly, because
[38:05.080 --> 38:07.840]  he was so hefty, climbed over my fence and took off.
[38:07.980 --> 38:11.340]  And, uh, I think that my, he was well fed.
[38:11.380 --> 38:12.020]  I'll say that.
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.320]  I think it might be him.
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.840]  I think he's the only other predator animal I've seen, you know, in my yard.
[38:19.900 --> 38:21.900]  And once again, I'm watching the bird thing.
[38:21.960 --> 38:22.960]  There's been no owls.
[38:22.960 --> 38:24.440]  There's been no birds of prey around.
[38:24.860 --> 38:28.080]  And so I think it's either a fox or this mega raccoon.
[38:28.260 --> 38:29.880]  Are they known for ripping up squirrels?
[38:30.220 --> 38:32.360]  I think they'll eat anything if they get their hands on it.
[38:32.360 --> 38:33.500]  I think they can be pretty vicious.
[38:34.140 --> 38:35.760]  He definitely scared the shit out of me.
[38:35.820 --> 38:37.880]  And now I'm scared to open my trash can at night anymore.
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.240]  He probably, he was his, Albert's 65 pounds or so.
[38:44.340 --> 38:45.720]  He was probably 40.
[38:46.080 --> 38:51.140]  Like, he was a sizable, maybe that's way too big to be a raccoon, but he was like as
[38:51.140 --> 38:52.920]  big around as my fucking dog, it seemed like.
[38:53.040 --> 38:53.900]  He was huge.
[38:54.580 --> 38:58.140]  And he definitely, he definitely wasn't in great shape because I was watching him, even
[38:58.140 --> 39:00.160]  shocked watching him get up the fence.
[39:00.260 --> 39:00.960]  It was pretty comical.
[39:01.580 --> 39:06.440]  While we were in the car, Jeff, I, you said something and then I wrote in my notes, Jeff
[39:06.440 --> 39:07.600]  strike idea.
[39:07.980 --> 39:09.160]  What was that?
[39:09.540 --> 39:10.880]  Jeff's strike idea.
[39:11.380 --> 39:14.320]  It has to be something related to the files, right?
[39:14.500 --> 39:15.520]  Gotta be, gotta be.
[39:16.120 --> 39:16.600]  Do you have an idea?
[39:16.740 --> 39:19.660]  Did you have an idea about future baseball or time machine baseball?
[39:19.660 --> 39:22.680]  I had an idea about time machine baseball, but I didn't talk about it with Gavin, I don't
[39:22.680 --> 39:22.900]  think.
[39:23.100 --> 39:26.120]  I was just saying we should put a bunch of different years of baseball games on a wheel
[39:26.120 --> 39:26.700]  and spin it.
[39:26.760 --> 39:29.840]  And then we have to play whichever one we land on and try to remember who's the good
[39:29.840 --> 39:30.780]  team and stuff that year.
[39:31.020 --> 39:32.440]  Could it go all the way back to the ninth?
[39:33.020 --> 39:35.060]  Yeah, it could go as far back as we want.
[39:35.260 --> 39:38.580]  Go back to RBI baseball on the NES if we want.
[39:38.840 --> 39:41.280]  I'll put it on the, I'll put it on the list.
[39:41.620 --> 39:42.480]  I'll put it on the ideal list.
[39:42.680 --> 39:45.340]  I was also thinking alternatively, if we wanted to get deep with it, we could pick a game
[39:45.340 --> 39:47.340]  like MLB that lets you do cut.
[39:47.340 --> 39:51.340]  This would be a lot of work, but you pick a game that lets you do custom teams and then
[39:51.340 --> 39:55.300]  you spin a wheel and then you have to pick a team from that year in baseball.
[39:55.620 --> 39:57.620]  Maybe you spin a second wheel to figure out what team it is.
[39:57.700 --> 39:59.460]  And then we just import that team into the game.
[39:59.520 --> 40:05.120]  So I could be the 72 Phillies while Eric's the 86 Padres and Gavin's the 2002 Mariners.
[40:05.220 --> 40:05.800]  That'd be crazy.
[40:05.900 --> 40:08.620]  That would take so long to get going and nobody would get it.
[40:08.820 --> 40:10.940]  No one, no one knows he's on the 2002 Mariners.
[40:11.220 --> 40:16.340]  It's one of those things that would be a lot cooler to do than to watch probably, you know?
[40:16.340 --> 40:19.240]  But I think the idea of just spinning the wheel and having to pick,
[40:19.640 --> 40:21.380]  you know, RBI baseball or King Griffey Jr.
[40:21.560 --> 40:23.520]  Baseball or whatever and play that would be fun.
[40:23.800 --> 40:24.780]  I think that's a lot of fun.
[40:24.980 --> 40:27.560]  I'm looking at raccoons being vicious.
[40:27.780 --> 40:28.360]  They're scary.
[40:29.120 --> 40:31.440]  There's some intimidating raccoons out there.
[40:31.440 --> 40:33.380]  Oh, you typically see them as like.
[40:33.880 --> 40:34.480]  Flat teeth.
[40:34.700 --> 40:35.120]  Kind of playful.
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.260]  Yeah, he could have fucked me up.
[40:37.660 --> 40:39.360]  He'd have come at me instead of going the other way.
[40:39.480 --> 40:40.980]  Oof, I don't know what I would have done.
[40:41.120 --> 40:42.320]  I might not be with us right now.
[40:42.320 --> 40:45.660]  I did search rage raccoon and.
[40:47.940 --> 40:49.920]  Yeah, yeah, kind of like that.
[40:50.500 --> 40:53.760]  There's something still funny about a raccoon yelling from a trash can.
[40:55.200 --> 40:56.860]  Even it's supposed to be aggressive.
[40:56.980 --> 40:58.680]  There's something about it that's just like,
[40:58.820 --> 41:00.780]  what the fuck are you doing over here?
[41:01.160 --> 41:02.220]  Why are you over here?
[41:03.000 --> 41:03.680]  This is mine.
[41:04.140 --> 41:05.060]  I live here.
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.060]  I'm waiting for a tattooed man to open this so I can scare him.
[41:09.880 --> 41:11.640]  Switching gears away from scary raccoons for a bit.
[41:11.760 --> 41:11.960]  Sure.
[41:11.960 --> 41:14.160]  I was streaming the other day and talking about
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.300]  how much fun the summer movie draft was in general.
[41:17.620 --> 41:20.320]  And somebody in the stream had a great idea.
[41:20.420 --> 41:22.620]  They said, you guys should sell a popcorn.
[41:22.780 --> 41:24.720]  Like, what is the Gerpler popcorn bucket?
[41:25.140 --> 41:27.880]  Oh, popcorn buckets are hot right now.
[41:28.020 --> 41:28.720]  Because here's the thing.
[41:28.820 --> 41:29.500]  Popcorn buckets are hot right now.
[41:29.520 --> 41:30.060]  Here's the thing.
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.740]  You think like off the rip, you're like, oh, it's the Gerpler or whatever.
[41:35.240 --> 41:41.100]  But popcorn buckets are not shaped like they would hold popcorn anymore.
[41:41.100 --> 41:43.400]  They're very ineffective typically at...
[41:43.400 --> 41:43.420]  Yeah.
[41:43.960 --> 41:46.900]  Yeah, it's like the whole Sarlacc pit one that was a big deal and all that.
[41:47.100 --> 41:50.680]  Right, but they're doing like Darth Vader shit where it's like his helmet.
[41:50.940 --> 41:53.580]  And so you can get pretty out there with it.
[41:53.660 --> 41:54.700]  You can even get...
[41:54.700 --> 41:55.980]  Hang on, let me send you this photo.
[41:56.600 --> 41:59.120]  It's not just popcorn bucket, which I think we should stick at.
[41:59.840 --> 42:01.440]  One that can hold soda?
[42:01.660 --> 42:02.980]  Very interesting to me.
[42:03.260 --> 42:03.820]  I've seen...
[42:03.820 --> 42:05.540]  Yeah, I was curious how that worked.
[42:05.680 --> 42:07.680]  What movie coming out has one where it's...
[42:07.680 --> 42:09.780]  Is it Defenders or whatever?
[42:09.960 --> 42:10.620]  That Marvel one?
[42:11.200 --> 42:11.600]  Thunderbolts?
[42:12.380 --> 42:12.780]  Thunderbolts.
[42:13.260 --> 42:17.300]  I think that one might have one that is a soda slash popcorn.
[42:17.920 --> 42:18.740]  What, like it's both?
[42:19.460 --> 42:20.400]  Yeah, I think so.
[42:20.740 --> 42:21.880]  We do have a Gerpler.
[42:22.060 --> 42:25.480]  And while I think it would be interesting to see what a Gerpler popcorn bucket would be,
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.540]  we also have a porta potty.
[42:58.220 --> 43:01.540]  Your earbud fell in a coffee cup.
[43:02.100 --> 43:03.440]  You need a taco.
[43:03.720 --> 43:04.660]  Pick me up.
[43:05.500 --> 43:08.960]  When modern life gets rough, grab the timeless taste of love.
[43:08.960 --> 43:11.280]  Paso, the old El Paso.
[43:13.160 --> 43:13.640]  Oh!
[43:15.400 --> 43:17.520]  Porta potty is a great one.
[43:17.740 --> 43:17.940]  Yeah.
[43:18.400 --> 43:19.820]  Perfect popcorn bucket vessel.
[43:20.100 --> 43:22.160]  So since we are into...
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.920]  Since we have the Wheel of Decades coming up,
[43:23.940 --> 43:26.180]  I don't know if that's come out yet or not, but I think it has, right?
[43:26.560 --> 43:30.180]  With where we have to watch the six episodes of Charmed 2018.
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.500]  And we've talked about indexing so heavily into like the summer movie stuff.
[43:35.500 --> 43:40.400]  Maybe it makes sense for us to investigate with El Famoso some sort of a
[43:41.600 --> 43:43.480]  porta potty themed popcorn bucket.
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.300]  Sending an email right now.
[43:45.520 --> 43:49.460]  Can it have a little toilet at the bottom for like one piece of popcorn to fall in?
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.740]  Dude, what if it's like a little...
[43:51.740 --> 43:53.140]  What if it's like a little butter fountain?
[43:53.300 --> 43:55.120]  You hit the button and it sprays out into the popcorn.
[43:58.180 --> 43:59.960]  Like a bidet for your popcorn.
[44:00.160 --> 44:01.080]  A butter bidet.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.160]  Can you die popcorn?
[44:04.810 --> 44:05.640]  Yeah, absolutely.
[44:06.080 --> 44:06.540]  100%.
[44:06.540 --> 44:08.180]  Like before it's popped?
[44:08.720 --> 44:09.160]  No.
[44:10.660 --> 44:11.720]  I don't think so.
[44:12.220 --> 44:13.660]  I think they do it after.
[44:14.220 --> 44:19.100]  I was wondering if I put like a kernel into just pure blue food dye, would it pop blue?
[44:19.460 --> 44:21.180]  Well, we have a kitchen. We can test it out, Gav.
[44:22.060 --> 44:23.860]  Let's soak some popcorn kernels.
[44:24.320 --> 44:26.540]  Yeah. I wonder if soaked kernels even pop though.
[44:26.920 --> 44:27.880]  Maybe after they dry out.
[44:28.240 --> 44:30.480]  We might have to soak and then dehydrate our kernels.
[44:30.480 --> 44:33.960]  That is why our office is a rented home.
[44:34.080 --> 44:36.540]  So we have access to a kitchen to try these things.
[44:37.200 --> 44:37.680]  100%.
[44:37.680 --> 44:39.240]  Kitchen is an important part.
[44:39.620 --> 44:41.420]  I'm thinking other popcorn bucket things we could do.
[44:41.580 --> 44:42.620]  We could do an Ian thing.
[44:44.080 --> 44:45.440]  Soda through the mouth.
[44:45.800 --> 44:48.400]  Ian is exactly... that's where my head went first was Ian.
[44:48.680 --> 44:52.240]  I think the Ian thing is so good because that reminds me of the Wolverine one
[44:52.780 --> 44:56.480]  is what I thought of where it's his big dumb ass head or whatever.
[44:57.940 --> 44:58.860]  Oh, you haven't?
[45:00.480 --> 45:01.100]  It's this.
[45:01.660 --> 45:04.120]  It's supposed to be in reply to the Dune one.
[45:04.120 --> 45:04.620]  Oh, yeah.
[45:04.880 --> 45:05.420]  That looks sexual.
[45:05.980 --> 45:06.140]  Yeah.
[45:06.940 --> 45:07.780]  That was the idea.
[45:08.260 --> 45:08.940]  So is that.
[45:09.360 --> 45:11.660]  And then you can put like, you know, it's popcorn.
[45:13.460 --> 45:15.640]  But an Ian one is a lot of fun.
[45:15.740 --> 45:20.240]  I'm emailing right now exploring popcorn buckets and we're thinking Port-a-Potty.
[45:22.000 --> 45:24.240]  So we will... I'll let you know when there's an update.
[45:24.520 --> 45:28.060]  I was a big fan of the Fast X popcorn bucket,
[45:28.060 --> 45:33.360]  which was just Vin Diesel's car really embracing the not at all
[45:33.360 --> 45:36.900]  a good mechanism for eating popcorn out of.
[45:37.060 --> 45:38.380]  But it just is absurd.
[45:38.840 --> 45:39.480]  Big fan.
[45:39.840 --> 45:45.340]  You just fucking lift up the top of his charger and you put the popcorn in the car.
[45:45.880 --> 45:47.240]  That's awesome.
[45:47.520 --> 45:48.760]  That looks cool as hell though.
[45:48.900 --> 45:49.720]  Yeah, it's great.
[45:49.960 --> 45:52.060]  Maybe we're popcorn bucket people.
[45:52.160 --> 45:53.960]  Maybe we can start collecting popcorn buckets.
[45:54.200 --> 45:56.260]  I'm definitely a popcorn bucket guy.
[45:56.260 --> 45:58.600]  I didn't realize I was, but I think I might be.
[45:59.100 --> 45:59.660]  I don't know.
[45:59.760 --> 46:00.520]  They get ridiculous.
[46:00.980 --> 46:01.520]  What do you eat, Nick?
[46:01.700 --> 46:02.800]  The dumber, the better.
[46:03.100 --> 46:03.600]  Yeah, I'm in.
[46:04.040 --> 46:07.460]  But when do you ever think, like, if you're ever eating popcorn out of a bowl,
[46:07.800 --> 46:09.660]  are you ever having a problem about that?
[46:09.860 --> 46:10.960]  No, it's great.
[46:11.180 --> 46:12.180]  What do you mean?
[46:12.640 --> 46:14.780]  I don't understand. I don't understand what you're saying.
[46:16.100 --> 46:16.760]  Me neither.
[46:18.060 --> 46:20.740]  Whenever I'm eating popcorn out of a bowl, it's perfectly fine.
[46:21.160 --> 46:21.480]  Yes.
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.200]  I don't need a specific thing for popcorn at any point.
[46:25.200 --> 46:27.840]  A lot of people felt that way before the Gerpler, too.
[46:27.960 --> 46:28.820]  And then they tried the Gerpler.
[46:29.220 --> 46:29.820]  Yeah, now what?
[46:29.840 --> 46:30.280]  That's fair play.
[46:30.440 --> 46:31.920]  Yeah, so now what, Gavin? Come on.
[46:32.180 --> 46:33.140]  Yeah, rebuttal?
[46:33.740 --> 46:34.180]  Yeah, thoughts?
[46:34.580 --> 46:37.200]  What if we all came up with our own popcorn buckets?
[46:37.760 --> 46:40.020]  Let's just try to get one, and then we can go.
[46:42.040 --> 46:43.640]  Yeah, but how do we know we're making the best one?
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.680]  All right, well, my idea was the Port-a-Potty.
[46:48.180 --> 46:49.960]  Yeah, I gotta go with Nick.
[46:50.060 --> 46:51.980]  Let's see how this one goes, and then we can go from there.
[46:52.780 --> 46:56.460]  What if we're all popcorn bucket people, but our audience are not?
[46:57.400 --> 46:59.520]  I'm definitely not a popcorn bucket person.
[46:59.980 --> 47:01.740]  It's like, I'm not at all.
[47:02.240 --> 47:03.940]  What if it was Snoopy, though?
[47:04.460 --> 47:06.900]  All right, now maybe we're talking.
[47:07.300 --> 47:09.340]  You would eat out of Snoopy's scalped head.
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.160]  Yeah, yeah, I'd eat out of Snoopy's scalped head.
[47:17.120 --> 47:18.000]  That sounds good.
[47:18.900 --> 47:20.260]  Here, I'll send you this picture.
[47:20.820 --> 47:25.900]  You know who's a big popcorn bucket guy is my very good friend Rocco.
[47:26.260 --> 47:33.300]  He loves the popcorn bucket, as evidenced by having about a dozen of them.
[47:33.300 --> 47:34.260]  Oh, he really does.
[47:34.600 --> 47:35.660]  Jesus Christ, well now...
[47:35.660 --> 47:39.160]  There are people who are super, people are super into the popcorn bucket.
[47:39.600 --> 47:40.260]  It is a big game.
[47:40.280 --> 47:42.660]  Rocco kind of sucks the fun out of this, doesn't he?
[47:42.660 --> 47:44.560]  Okay, cool, awesome, right on.
[47:44.820 --> 47:47.140]  Yeah, but look, that's the first time I've seen him look happy.
[47:48.540 --> 47:49.420]  Exactly, exactly.
[47:49.420 --> 47:50.620]  Have you ever seen that before?
[47:51.000 --> 47:52.100]  A genuine smile?
[47:52.440 --> 47:53.420]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[47:53.720 --> 47:56.080]  There you go, so something to think about.
[47:56.540 --> 47:58.400]  Have you seen the xenomorph one, Gavin?
[47:58.800 --> 47:59.100]  No.
[48:00.960 --> 48:03.980]  Imagine sitting in the theater trying to eat your popcorn out of this.
[48:04.060 --> 48:06.180]  It's just a xenomorph head.
[48:06.620 --> 48:08.700]  They didn't even use the mouth as like...
[48:08.700 --> 48:11.540]  No, no, it's the top of the head that they fill up.
[48:11.980 --> 48:13.540]  It is so long and bulky.
[48:13.660 --> 48:16.600]  It would be so uncomfortable to sit in a movie theater and eat that.
[48:16.600 --> 48:20.280]  Also, there's no way that the popcorn chamber is the entire length of that.
[48:20.600 --> 48:21.040]  No.
[48:21.780 --> 48:22.700]  You'd never get any out.
[48:23.000 --> 48:23.680]  It's a disaster.
[48:23.880 --> 48:24.900]  Dig that one, Eric.
[48:25.320 --> 48:26.060]  Oh, that's really cute.
[48:26.100 --> 48:27.540]  It's a Snoopy in his houses.
[48:27.960 --> 48:32.500]  Yeah, so you drink out of a long Snoopy and then you're hanging out with Woodstock eating corn.
[48:33.000 --> 48:33.920]  That's really cool.
[48:34.360 --> 48:34.520]  Yeah.
[48:35.180 --> 48:39.120]  You think there's a way we could figure out like a Rizzler sort of situation?
[48:41.120 --> 48:44.320]  I'm still waiting on Rizzle Tea or whatever that was called.
[48:44.320 --> 48:48.240]  Dude, oh yeah, that was like the worst April Fool's joke because I wanted it.
[48:48.500 --> 48:49.600]  The Arizona Iced Tea.
[48:49.840 --> 48:50.320]  Arizona.
[48:51.200 --> 48:51.860]  I thought that was great.
[48:52.420 --> 48:52.920]  This is great.
[48:53.040 --> 48:58.480]  This should, honestly, Rizzler and Julia Louis-Dreyfus should just do Neuseinfeld.
[49:02.860 --> 49:03.920]  Rizzler is Kramer.
[49:05.300 --> 49:07.260]  That's exactly what I thought too.
[49:07.440 --> 49:08.680]  Like watch him burst in the door.
[49:08.860 --> 49:09.480]  That's fantastic.
[49:10.080 --> 49:10.700]  Is it Louise?
[49:10.800 --> 49:11.600]  I thought it was Louie.
[49:12.040 --> 49:12.980]  It's Louie, isn't it?
[49:12.980 --> 49:14.320]  All I know is it's Sevigny.
[49:15.220 --> 49:16.400]  It's definitely Sevigny.
[49:16.900 --> 49:17.360]  Sevigny.
[49:17.760 --> 49:18.860]  That's what we're trying to tell you.
[49:22.990 --> 49:27.490]  I am really curious how long the Rizzler's reign is going to be.
[49:27.570 --> 49:28.570]  I hope it's a long time.
[49:28.990 --> 49:30.310]  The Rizzler's reign.
[49:30.710 --> 49:34.170]  Do you think the Rizzler will last longer than Andy Milonakis did?
[49:34.570 --> 49:34.930]  Yes.
[49:35.390 --> 49:36.110]  Yeah, probably.
[49:36.830 --> 49:38.470]  But Andy Milonakis is still around.
[49:38.630 --> 49:38.930]  You just have him.
[49:38.930 --> 49:39.670]  He's still doing stuff.
[49:39.850 --> 49:41.190]  He is still doing stuff.
[49:41.310 --> 49:43.970]  I just heard him on Stavros World the other day.
[49:44.530 --> 49:45.410]  He's definitely kicking it.
[49:45.410 --> 49:46.630]  I just... I...
[49:47.350 --> 49:48.570]  Age is really...
[49:48.570 --> 49:53.150]  Much like Expedition 33, age is going to come for the Rizzler, unfortunately.
[49:54.630 --> 49:55.730]  It's not the Patris.
[49:55.910 --> 49:56.890]  It's going to be puberty.
[49:57.090 --> 49:59.610]  It's going to really damage the Rizzler brand.
[50:00.130 --> 50:00.790]  You never know, though.
[50:00.810 --> 50:03.050]  It could be like that Neville Longbottom, dude.
[50:03.870 --> 50:05.570]  He turned into a fucking...
[50:05.570 --> 50:07.050]  Puberty turned him into a hunk.
[50:07.590 --> 50:08.690]  Not about... No, I'm not...
[50:08.690 --> 50:09.710]  This isn't about appearance.
[50:09.830 --> 50:12.910]  I just think that so much of the Rizzler's appeal is how small he is.
[50:13.710 --> 50:16.670]  I think it's just his extreme charisma.
[50:16.890 --> 50:17.750]  You think so?
[50:18.150 --> 50:20.790]  I think it's the word Rizzler.
[50:21.230 --> 50:23.910]  It also tickles my brain.
[50:24.150 --> 50:30.750]  Like the word wizard or lizard that I enjoy saying and hearing and I don't get tired of.
[50:30.850 --> 50:34.010]  I like hearing and saying the word Rizzler a lot.
[50:34.170 --> 50:34.990]  You just like Zeds.
[50:35.410 --> 50:35.770]  Zees.
[50:36.250 --> 50:37.530]  Yeah, I'm a big Zeds guy.
[50:38.330 --> 50:39.050]  Lord Zed.
[50:39.170 --> 50:39.670]  All of it.
[50:39.770 --> 50:41.650]  You would probably love saying Zizzler.
[50:41.650 --> 50:45.070]  You should name something Zizzler and then you can just have a Z overload.
[50:45.630 --> 50:46.910]  What if Rizzler was at Sizzler?
[50:47.030 --> 50:50.730]  That should be an April Fool's thing is there's a Rizzler Sizzler.
[50:51.190 --> 50:51.790]  Write it down.
[50:53.010 --> 50:53.490]  Right?
[50:53.990 --> 50:54.470]  Okay.
[50:55.110 --> 50:55.410]  All right.
[50:55.430 --> 50:55.650]  Hang on.
[50:55.770 --> 50:56.790]  I'll write it down.
[50:56.910 --> 50:57.250]  Okay.
[50:58.890 --> 51:01.690]  I just have a jot down Rizzler Sizzler real quick.
[51:02.190 --> 51:05.450]  For five grand, would you legally change your name to Zarek?
[51:06.090 --> 51:07.190]  I don't think so.
[51:08.770 --> 51:10.470]  No, not for five grand.
[51:10.470 --> 51:11.950]  I think I'd rather wear a beret.
[51:12.130 --> 51:12.590]  You know what I mean?
[51:12.870 --> 51:13.450]  What about Erez?
[51:14.830 --> 51:16.170]  Erez is pretty good.
[51:16.450 --> 51:17.350]  That might be pretty good.
[51:17.490 --> 51:18.290]  E-R-I-Z?
[51:19.590 --> 51:21.850]  I wouldn't recommend doing bits around your name.
[51:22.850 --> 51:24.710]  Yeah, the name thing's tough.
[51:25.070 --> 51:26.530]  I just don't think you can do that.
[51:26.630 --> 51:29.170]  I think you gotta hang on to the name.
[51:29.650 --> 51:30.070]  It's tough.
[51:30.450 --> 51:30.850]  I don't know.
[51:30.850 --> 51:31.750]  I changed my name a bunch.
[51:31.870 --> 51:32.690]  It worked out okay for me.
[51:34.790 --> 51:37.250]  Is it laser with an S or a Zed?
[51:37.750 --> 51:38.370]  With a Zed.
[51:40.470 --> 51:41.430]  As we say in America.
[51:41.750 --> 51:42.730]  Rizzler Laser.
[51:42.970 --> 51:43.790]  Laser Rizzler.
[51:44.190 --> 51:44.550]  Sizzler.
[51:45.090 --> 51:45.970]  Lizard Wizard.
[51:51.190 --> 51:53.130]  You just activate somebody?
[51:55.390 --> 51:57.930]  Hey, Andrew, how are we on strikes?
[51:58.430 --> 51:59.590]  I feel good about strikes.
[51:59.710 --> 52:00.910]  You guys made a ruling, right?
[52:01.670 --> 52:01.870]  Yeah.
[52:01.950 --> 52:02.830]  Those two didn't count.
[52:03.050 --> 52:04.870]  I'm happy with whatever the ruling was.
[52:04.990 --> 52:05.910]  You got any new ones?
[52:06.330 --> 52:06.650]  No.
[52:06.830 --> 52:08.710]  Well, you.
[52:08.970 --> 52:10.210]  I had some from you.
[52:11.410 --> 52:13.510]  You're not really in the game too much.
[52:13.710 --> 52:14.610]  And you were sick.
[52:14.730 --> 52:16.490]  It was when you came back and you were sick.
[52:16.610 --> 52:17.970]  And like, it was a lot.
[52:18.010 --> 52:18.810]  It was very understandable.
[52:19.250 --> 52:21.990]  Andrew asked me to upload some files, and then I didn't.
[52:22.070 --> 52:23.790]  And then he reminded me I didn't upload them.
[52:24.050 --> 52:25.370]  Or I did, and I uploaded the wrong ones.
[52:25.610 --> 52:27.430]  And I drove, Gavin and I, was when we were getting the TV,
[52:27.570 --> 52:29.510]  drove all the way to the house to upload a file for him.
[52:29.690 --> 52:31.110]  And I still uploaded the wrong file.
[52:31.590 --> 52:32.110]  You wait, wait, wait.
[52:32.450 --> 52:32.770]  What?
[52:33.050 --> 52:35.810]  We drove all the way to your house, and I stood in your living room
[52:35.810 --> 52:37.710]  for you to give him the wrong file?
[52:38.870 --> 52:39.710]  Apparently, yeah.
[52:41.310 --> 52:42.490]  Was it the same thing?
[52:42.570 --> 52:43.550]  I thought it was a different thing.
[52:43.850 --> 52:44.930]  Now, now here's the thing.
[52:45.030 --> 52:48.290]  I know you're not in the strike game, Jeff, but I think maybe you have one now.
[52:48.370 --> 52:49.130]  You might be.
[52:49.610 --> 52:50.310]  Let me check.
[52:50.550 --> 52:51.210]  I felt pretty bad about it.
[52:51.570 --> 52:51.950]  It was...
[52:52.770 --> 52:54.670]  Oh, that's my Jeff strike idea.
[52:55.050 --> 52:56.010]  That, oh, there you go.
[52:56.450 --> 52:56.930]  There you go.
[52:57.190 --> 52:58.470]  That's my Jeff strike idea.
[52:58.830 --> 53:01.790]  What my idea was, so the game is that if I get 20 strikes,
[53:01.790 --> 53:03.510]  I have to eat that gross thing, right?
[53:05.050 --> 53:08.850]  Now, what if, if there's anyone that gets more strikes than me,
[53:09.330 --> 53:10.270]  I just don't have to do it?
[53:10.470 --> 53:11.370]  I'm fine with that.
[53:11.790 --> 53:14.790]  And we're not, and nothing happens to them, but I just don't have to do it.
[53:15.310 --> 53:16.250]  Yeah, yeah, I'm okay with that.
[53:16.810 --> 53:17.330]  Oh, wow.
[53:17.350 --> 53:19.190]  I was not expecting people to be okay with that.
[53:19.290 --> 53:21.190]  Well, I don't think there's any chance in hell it's going to happen.
[53:23.150 --> 53:23.790]  Well, okay.
[53:24.370 --> 53:25.710]  Well, I mean, Nick got one.
[53:26.090 --> 53:27.510]  If we're playing past...
[53:28.570 --> 53:28.890]  No.
[53:30.750 --> 53:31.390]  So, sorry.
[53:31.910 --> 53:33.050]  I didn't mean knowing that.
[53:33.150 --> 53:36.090]  I was looking at, I was checking the file situation with Jeff and the strikes.
[53:36.770 --> 53:37.730]  They were two different things.
[53:37.730 --> 53:41.290]  So, Jeff, you uploaded the right thing at the time.
[53:41.930 --> 53:42.370]  Oh, I did?
[53:42.510 --> 53:42.850]  You're all good with Gavin.
[53:42.990 --> 53:43.110]  Nice.
[53:43.110 --> 53:43.330]  Yeah.
[53:43.790 --> 53:44.390]  Oh, okay.
[53:44.390 --> 53:44.870]  It was...
[53:44.870 --> 53:45.510]  I thought I had it wrong.
[53:46.070 --> 53:46.790]  I was so confused.
[53:47.350 --> 53:49.010]  I didn't, yeah, I...
[53:51.370 --> 53:55.650]  I got a text for, it was the third repo video we did.
[53:56.310 --> 54:00.210]  And I just took a screenshot of it because I didn't feel like trying to articulate what
[54:00.210 --> 54:00.930]  was described.
[54:01.370 --> 54:02.690]  And I sent it to Jeff.
[54:02.810 --> 54:06.250]  And the text is, the video is a chicken horse gameplay.
[54:06.250 --> 54:08.390]  And the audio is labeled right.
[54:08.470 --> 54:10.110]  But I don't think it's the right file.
[54:12.730 --> 54:15.530]  So, I thought I had uploaded a chicken horse video.
[54:16.190 --> 54:19.550]  And then the wrong audio, but named the right audio.
[54:20.130 --> 54:21.270]  Yeah, it was supposed to be repo.
[54:21.370 --> 54:22.570]  And you put in a chicken horse.
[54:22.650 --> 54:26.510]  And you put in the wrong audio for that video as well.
[54:26.530 --> 54:26.750]  Yeah.
[54:26.910 --> 54:28.330]  I think you probably did repo four.
[54:28.430 --> 54:29.390]  Yeah, it's all good now.
[54:29.810 --> 54:30.190]  But...
[54:30.190 --> 54:33.690]  I was getting really confused when I was trying to use my time machine to make sure I wouldn't
[54:33.690 --> 54:34.870]  get any past strikes.
[54:34.870 --> 54:36.010]  I was looking through some folders.
[54:36.710 --> 54:39.510]  And Andrew has named so much of the Doomsday heist, Deadline.
[54:39.670 --> 54:40.470]  It's very confusing.
[54:41.550 --> 54:43.730]  Yeah, I think I just fucked up the name on that.
[54:43.770 --> 54:44.650]  That is totally me.
[54:44.910 --> 54:46.530]  I don't know why I thought it was Deadline.
[54:46.930 --> 54:48.630]  Well, Deadline is the Tron game.
[54:49.390 --> 54:51.010]  Yes, like I know it's from that.
[54:51.090 --> 54:55.890]  But for some reason, Deadline and Doomsday have merged into just being one thing.
[54:55.990 --> 54:57.030]  It's all Deadline.
[54:57.550 --> 54:59.930]  That explains a lot about some of the meetings we were having.
[55:00.130 --> 55:04.310]  Wait, so is that why you had Doomsday edited like eight months early?
[55:04.950 --> 55:05.310]  Yeah.
[55:05.710 --> 55:06.750]  Did I say it was Deadline?
[55:07.490 --> 55:10.170]  Well, no, we were saying Deadline should come out.
[55:10.270 --> 55:14.430]  And then you were working on heists that were like eight videos ahead of where we were editing.
[55:14.850 --> 55:18.310]  Well, no, I was doing that because we had just done a GTA month.
[55:18.570 --> 55:22.370]  And so I was trying to get us in a position where if we wanted to be able to do that,
[55:22.730 --> 55:23.790]  it would be easy to release.
[55:24.090 --> 55:26.970]  Well, you should probably have worked on the videos that were after the ones that were coming
[55:26.970 --> 55:30.050]  out and not the ones 12 from when...
[55:30.050 --> 55:31.930]  They were both being worked on simultaneously.
[55:32.210 --> 55:34.410]  Those are two different editors working on two different things.
[55:34.410 --> 55:37.970]  But why would the second round of heists come out before the first?
[55:38.470 --> 55:43.290]  See, this is why Gavin needs to be in charge for whatever reason for the things he's saying
[55:43.290 --> 55:45.030]  that I'm not sure that I fully understand.
[55:45.430 --> 55:48.450]  I don't need to be in charge. Just Andrew shouldn't be in charge.
[55:49.770 --> 55:51.250]  I love... You know what?
[55:51.250 --> 55:52.650]  I think Andrew's doing a great job.
[55:52.710 --> 55:55.170]  I think he's doing a fantastic job. Andrew, don't listen to him.
[55:55.330 --> 55:57.950]  I think there's only one man up to the task and it sounds like it's Gavin.
[55:58.150 --> 56:01.570]  I think he's... It's either Andrew or Gavin for me and that's it.
[56:01.990 --> 56:02.490]  That's it.
[56:02.490 --> 56:04.350]  Hey, Gavin, this whole...
[56:04.350 --> 56:07.170]  I don't know how this meandering conversation jogged this memory,
[56:07.330 --> 56:09.750]  but do you remember the game type we used to play in GTA
[56:09.750 --> 56:12.370]  where we were all on like platforms kind of like Deadline
[56:12.370 --> 56:15.970]  and then there'd be a circle you'd have to get to by a time limit
[56:15.970 --> 56:17.990]  and then the ground would start to fall away.
[56:18.430 --> 56:20.730]  And then if you were outside the circle, you'd blow up
[56:20.730 --> 56:22.290]  and everybody had to like cram into the circle.
[56:22.710 --> 56:24.550]  I remember the game. Do I remember the name? No.
[56:25.090 --> 56:26.470]  Oh, damn. I don't remember the name either.
[56:26.550 --> 56:29.550]  But if that's still around, we should absolutely play that.
[56:29.550 --> 56:32.930]  I think I think that's where this I am monster truck came from.
[56:33.350 --> 56:35.790]  I think you are right. Yeah, I think you're right.
[56:36.050 --> 56:38.030]  There's like not enough room for everybody in the circle.
[56:38.190 --> 56:39.850]  And if anybody's car's out at all, they explode.
[56:40.250 --> 56:41.210]  And you're just like, oh, that sounds fun.
[56:41.930 --> 56:42.890]  We should play that.
[56:43.230 --> 56:44.830]  There's so many things in GTA we should play.
[56:45.090 --> 56:48.390]  Maybe somebody in the audience knows what it's called and can remind us.
[56:50.330 --> 56:52.190]  I'm still looking for my Fall Guys level.
[56:52.590 --> 56:53.790]  I'm still thinking about it.
[56:54.170 --> 56:55.890]  Has anyone in the community come across it, Dieter?
[56:56.550 --> 56:58.270]  Uh, I've had a few people reach out.
[56:58.310 --> 56:59.330]  I need to try one of them.
[57:00.130 --> 57:02.730]  But I just I don't think I'll ever find it again.
[57:02.870 --> 57:06.310]  I think it will evade me for the rest of time.
[57:07.210 --> 57:07.970]  Never know.
[57:08.570 --> 57:09.230]  I'm hopeful.
[57:09.350 --> 57:13.250]  Maybe try and get in contact with someone who works at that game company and see if it's
[57:13.890 --> 57:15.110]  tied to your account somehow.
[57:15.630 --> 57:16.430]  That's interesting.
[57:16.650 --> 57:17.650]  In your account history.
[57:18.110 --> 57:19.310]  Do you know what day you played it?
[57:19.590 --> 57:20.750]  I have no clue about that.
[57:21.070 --> 57:23.830]  But if they do a morning show, would you be open to being on their morning show?
[57:24.750 --> 57:27.330]  Why would a game development company have a morning show?
[57:27.890 --> 57:29.190]  It's not for me to judge.
[57:29.190 --> 57:30.410]  I'm just saying if they do.
[57:30.630 --> 57:30.990]  Sure.
[57:31.050 --> 57:34.330]  You know how like GTA had programming on the TVs in the game, maybe?
[57:34.830 --> 57:35.310]  I don't know.
[57:35.530 --> 57:37.230]  I'm sure they do more than just Fall Guys.
[57:37.370 --> 57:39.050]  I'm sure they got a whole bunch of stuff going on out there.
[57:39.270 --> 57:42.650]  I'm just trying to reduce the steps for circling back around.
[57:43.030 --> 57:43.750]  You're already an in.
[57:44.150 --> 57:47.050]  I can email them and say, hey, I got a guy who's already ready to go.
[57:47.110 --> 57:47.510]  He's in.
[57:47.670 --> 57:48.090]  He's ready.
[57:48.430 --> 57:49.510]  Do you have a morning show?
[57:49.810 --> 57:51.530]  There is nothing better than an Andrew email.
[57:51.970 --> 57:52.270]  Yeah.
[57:53.130 --> 57:53.730]  I'm scared.
[57:53.870 --> 57:54.470]  There's plenty better.
[57:54.990 --> 57:55.210]  Why?
[57:55.650 --> 57:57.310]  I'm just scared of what I'm going to end up committed to.
[57:57.310 --> 57:59.270]  Well, you don't have to commit to anything.
[57:59.370 --> 58:00.010]  It's your call.
[58:00.470 --> 58:01.750]  I'm just presenting them to you.
[58:01.950 --> 58:06.070]  But I mean, in terms of content, I should probably be saying yes to all of it.
[58:06.430 --> 58:06.910]  You don't have to.
[58:07.250 --> 58:09.710]  Do you think, uh, yeah, no, that's fine.
[58:09.810 --> 58:11.030]  I'm just, uh, what do you mean?
[58:11.150 --> 58:12.690]  What do you mean saying yes to all of it?
[58:14.610 --> 58:16.390]  Just anything that comes your way here?
[58:16.690 --> 58:16.910]  Yeah.
[58:17.170 --> 58:20.690]  I mean, Andrew's taking the time out of his schedule to become my agent.
[58:21.570 --> 58:22.770]  I don't want to waste his time.
[58:23.570 --> 58:24.930]  That makes me nervous.
[58:25.870 --> 58:27.510]  Yeah, I use that also.
[58:27.510 --> 58:29.550]  Yeah, that makes me nervous as well.
[58:29.570 --> 58:31.870]  I now need to be more selective and what?
[58:32.110 --> 58:33.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[58:33.210 --> 58:36.830]  If I have a safeguard of him saying he's certainly going to say no to this,
[58:36.970 --> 58:41.050]  but if that's gone, then that changes things for how I would approach this.
[58:41.250 --> 58:44.290]  We're basically going to end up playing like publicity chicken.
[58:44.350 --> 58:45.370]  I guess so.
[58:47.270 --> 58:50.270]  Are you an are you a regulation, uh,
[58:50.270 --> 58:53.890]  listener or comment leaver who works at a local or regional morning show?
[58:55.010 --> 58:56.150]  Please reach out.
[58:57.510 --> 58:58.750]  It's got to be Canadian.
[58:59.110 --> 58:59.850]  It's got to be.
[58:59.850 --> 59:04.230]  I just want like some Nova Scotia TV station.
[59:04.830 --> 59:08.630]  Just are you less less likely to criticize your own nation's morning show, Andrew?
[59:08.890 --> 59:12.150]  No, I would equally criticize it because I think you're better than it.
[59:12.330 --> 59:13.070]  That was my point.
[59:13.230 --> 59:14.270]  You're better than Canada.
[59:14.430 --> 59:15.670]  You think Gavin's better than Canada?
[59:15.770 --> 59:17.890]  I think he's better than morning show appearances.
[59:18.750 --> 59:20.050]  Even the Today Show?
[59:20.950 --> 59:21.910]  That's a big one.
[59:22.070 --> 59:23.450]  Now, that's that's like that.
[59:23.450 --> 59:25.710]  I think that is like the ultimate one.
[59:26.230 --> 59:29.370]  If you're on the Today Show, you better say the name of this fucking podcast, man.
[59:30.890 --> 59:32.830]  Please, I'm begging you, please.
[59:33.110 --> 59:35.150]  You better be eating out of that popcorn bucket.
[59:35.530 --> 59:38.650]  Yeah, because if you're on the Today Show and you don't promote us,
[59:38.730 --> 59:40.850]  tomorrow is going to be the owl show for you.
[59:48.170 --> 59:53.570]  It's going to be the owl show.
[59:53.570 --> 59:55.710]  What would the intro to the owl show sound like?
[59:56.410 --> 59:56.850]  Ow!
[59:57.090 --> 59:59.970]  Don't, don't, don't mention this on the Today Show and find out.
[01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:04.970]  Oh, I've got, I got a show idea.
[01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.470]  But there's no conversion. We've already talked about it.
[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:07.850]  What?
[01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.850]  Right, but it's something I can show.
[01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.750]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:13.450]  But it's something I can show my mom and she knows what that is.
[01:00:13.830 --> 01:00:14.110]  Right.
[01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.670]  Well, I might as well get them to say hello, Eric Badour.
[01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.830]  Okay, get them to do that.
[01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:22.390]  It just seems like it maybe would be more productive if it was the podcast.
[01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.230]  But yeah, just have them say my name. That's fine too.
[01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.550]  We're so, for the first time, we're brand safe, Gavin.
[01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.170]  For the first time ever.
[01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:30.010]  I'm not sure what the...
[01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:33.510]  But what's funnier, listen to the regulation podcast or hello, Eric's mom.
[01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:37.610]  Dude, if it was hello, Eric's mom, that would be pretty cool.
[01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:40.770]  She wouldn't know what's going on. That's pretty exciting.
[01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:44.830]  I have a show I want to pitch doing with you, Gavin.
[01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:46.790]  That has been in my head.
[01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:52.010]  That there's part of me that wants to, I'd love to just surprise the rest of the guys
[01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.890]  that are doing this, but I also really want to hear your reaction to the pitch.
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:01.770]  It's called Behind the Mask and it's a podcast with you and I
[01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:06.070]  trying to talk through having our CPAPs on at the same time,
[01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:07.870]  wearing our masks and communicating.
[01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:12.750]  I was doing this in bed the other night where I was trying to say sentences
[01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:15.290]  with my mask and it's really difficult because it's
[01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:19.710]  blasting air through your nostrils into your throat when you talk.
[01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:25.210]  It is not easy to do and it made me very gassy boy after I did it for quite a while.
[01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:29.270]  It's all aired up, but I think doing a little mini supplemental,
[01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:33.610]  you and I trying to conduct a podcast with our masks on
[01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:36.510]  and while wearing them could be pretty good.
[01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.330]  For me, it just sounds like very short nasally sentences followed by like...
[01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:44.130]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like for me.
[01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.930]  I think that would be very funny.
[01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:49.330]  Why don't we debut a segment on the next regulation?
[01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.890]  We'll just have like a two minute chat with our PAPs.
[01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.790]  This is such an innovative idea.
[01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:58.750]  We need to take this straight to the morning shows.
[01:01:58.830 --> 01:01:59.790]  They're going to love it.
[01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.010]  CPAPs are a hot button issue right now
[01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.730]  and it's going to be perfect for their audience.
[01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:12.710]  I've noted in my notes that next week or next episode behind the mask.
[01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:15.170]  So that way, when we get into it, we'll know right away.
[01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.950]  I love it.
[01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:17.530]  Lug all that shit into my office.
[01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:21.950]  I was thinking, like, do they make extension cords for CPAPs?
[01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:22.650]  They must, right?
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:25.310]  What's the longest CPAP hose I can get?
[01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.110]  I don't think the hose can be that long.
[01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:31.990]  Can I have just an insanely long hose?
[01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.790]  I mean, would that work?
[01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:36.670]  You'd just be breathing hose air.
[01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.530]  I feel like I'm already breathing hose air.
[01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.290]  Let me look up.
[01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:43.990]  Can we?
[01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:45.630]  They make travel PAPs.
[01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:46.690]  They sure do.
[01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:48.010]  It's they're like portable, right?
[01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:48.630]  Yeah.
[01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.090]  Like little USB ones for planes and stuff.
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:53.670]  Do they call it a TPAP extender?
[01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:54.130]  I think so.
[01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.490]  No, they should.
[01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:57.170]  How long can I get these?
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:02.390]  So yeah, CPAP extension hose doesn't seem like they're too absurdly long.
[01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:04.350]  I wonder if there's a group PAP.
[01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:06.770]  That is a nightmare.
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:08.950]  Could you get one machine for like six hoses?
[01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.110]  Like a hookah?
[01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:10.690]  Kind of.
[01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:13.110]  Like the dreaming machine?
[01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:21.230]  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be a product that is what I want of like a six foot CPAP hose.
[01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:23.670]  Do you think you could build the GPAP, Gavin?
[01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:25.210]  Oh, the GPAP.
[01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:26.210]  That's interesting.
[01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:27.210]  You get in the lab.
[01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.010]  Yeah, I bet I could build a GPAP.
[01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:31.530]  I just need to like reverse engineer a regular PAP.
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:32.330]  Yeah.
[01:03:32.650 --> 01:03:35.710]  What do I need, like a little air compressor, a little humidifier?
[01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:36.830]  Probably not much else.
[01:03:37.290 --> 01:03:39.950]  Some hoses, a couple of J-bends.
[01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:42.570]  Oh, a 10 foot extra long hose.
[01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:44.870]  When was the last time you bought a J-bend?
[01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:46.630]  That was with you, I believe.
[01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.870]  But we're very cyclical.
[01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:51.930]  Like we've done the TV again.
[01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.550]  It could be that our next trip might be for a J-bend.
[01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.090]  How are your sinks holding up?
[01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.070]  Uh, I mean, it's a rental, so I don't give a shit.
[01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.090]  But OK, we'll see.
[01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.710]  We'll have to see how the dump rooms in the office hold up.
[01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.390]  I am excited for us to get the office finalized.
[01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.490]  Although by this time it comes out, it will have been done by now.
[01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:10.870]  Yeah.
[01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.110]  We're post-string, we're post, we're in season two.
[01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:14.990]  What an entrance into season two.
[01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:17.990]  CPAP masks, hoses, popcorn buckets.
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:20.110]  I'm excited to see what this year brings.
[01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:21.290]  Blindsides.
[01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:22.570]  That's true.
[01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.410]  It's been a hell of a season already.
[01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:26.130]  We're only an hour and 15 minutes into it.
[01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:29.370]  I thought about using my blindside to blindside us
[01:04:29.370 --> 01:04:31.730]  back to what we were going to do before we got blindsided.
[01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:33.950]  Whoa.
[01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:36.330]  That's a nefarious way to use a blindside.
[01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.250]  I never considered that.
[01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:41.190]  Like, imagine if we started this podcast and then I said blindside to play Wormsome again.
[01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:42.070]  Wow.
[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.090]  Like, would that be allowed?
[01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:46.290]  I mean, I guess.
[01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:47.010]  Yeah.
[01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.410]  I just never thought about using a blindside for good.
[01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.810]  My blindsides are educational.
[01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.850]  Yeah, sure.
[01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.270]  Your blindsides fill me with dread.
[01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.270]  Little is Hobo is pretty good.
[01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:06.190]  That was great.
[01:05:06.550 --> 01:05:07.670]  Learned about Canadian culture.
[01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:08.930]  Nick, have you ever done one?
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:09.850]  No!
[01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.290]  I need to think of one.
[01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:13.290]  Yeah, you two need to use them.
[01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:14.210]  They're a lot of fun.
[01:05:14.570 --> 01:05:15.170]  Yeah, they are fun.
[01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:15.830]  They are real fun.
[01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:17.790]  So we get two a year, right?
[01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.010]  A video game one and then a...
[01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.850]  Video game and a live action.
[01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.730]  Okay.
[01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:22.450]  So I got a video game blindside.
[01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:24.110]  Two a year is nuts.
[01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.490]  That's 10 blindsides a year.
[01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:26.510]  Well, not really.
[01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.590]  It's more like five because you don't really use yours.
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:30.750]  Nick isn't using yours.
[01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:34.070]  Chances are great that I won't use a video game blindside.
[01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:35.230]  I can't even imagine what I would do.
[01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:37.670]  I'm scared if you do.
[01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:38.990]  Are there any AIDS games?
[01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:42.330]  We should end this show.
[01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.130]  Well, there you go.
[01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:47.730]  This is the end of the beginning of season two.
[01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.270]  After this, we're just in it.
[01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.850]  It's just in season two.
[01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.850]  Thanks for watching for the first year.
[01:05:56.090 --> 01:06:00.230]  Maybe continue to watch into the next year and then each subsequent year after that.
[01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.650]  And we really do appreciate it.
[01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:04.490]  Give us stars.
[01:06:05.130 --> 01:06:05.750]  Oh, you know what?
[01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:06.630]  We have mail now.
[01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:08.110]  You can send us mail if you want to.
[01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:15.170]  Our address is P.O. Box 13146 Care of Regulation Company, Austin, Texas 78701.
[01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.350]  I'm not saying it twice.
[01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:17.710]  Thank you very much.
[01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:18.910]  Have you measured it?
[01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:20.110]  Have I measured what?
[01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:21.150]  The P.O. Box?
[01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:21.970]  Yes.
[01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:23.310]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:25.090]  Right when we first started, we did.
[01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.970]  Then we have some stuff that we need to open and all that.
[01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:29.270]  So what's the size of it?
[01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:31.750]  It's like a bigger than a bread box.
[01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:33.270]  Okay.
[01:06:33.290 --> 01:06:34.030]  Bigger than a bread box.
[01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.490]  Do you need the actual dimensions?
[01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.330]  I can just give notes.
[01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:39.910]  People can't send anything bigger than bread.
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:43.150]  It's the size is it's a size four.
[01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.930]  It's 11 inches by 11 inches.
[01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:47.330]  Oh, that's that's bigger than bread.
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:49.530]  Yeah, but I said it was bigger than a bread box.
[01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:54.390]  But also, if they if somebody mails you something bigger than your P.O. Box,
[01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.610]  it doesn't just get returned for being too large.
[01:06:56.770 --> 01:07:00.570]  They just put a yellow sheet of paper in your in your P.O. Box that says
[01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:03.890]  go to the window and ask for this package and they give it to you.
[01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.170]  Do they get mingy about that?
[01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:06.730]  Do they charge you extra for that?
[01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.250]  No, they don't get mingy or charge you extra.
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:11.890]  Only if you ask for cheese.
[01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:12.590]  Yeah.
[01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:19.530]  I just put AIDS in the Microsoft store and you get a Gundam update for some reason.
[01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:23.190]  Gundam Battle Alliance in the films category.
[01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:27.730]  You get a movie called Band Aid and the Gulf Doctor.
[01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.050]  First aid for your game.
[01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.730]  Well, definitely something to think about for future blindsides.
[01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.370]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.350]  We'll see you next week.
[01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:41.830]  First practice is almost here.
[01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:46.870]  Gear up on budget when you shop quality used sports equipment at Play It Again Sports.
[01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:49.890]  Plus, get paid on the spot for outgrown items.
