[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.940 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.960 --> 00:10.520]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.900 --> 00:12.360]  Available for a limited time.
[00:12.620 --> 00:14.740]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:16.300 --> 00:18.380]  Nick! Nick, it's happening!
[00:19.140 --> 00:20.360]  Nick! Nick!
[00:20.420 --> 00:21.220]  I'm trying, Nick!
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.040]  Nick, it appears... Nick, it looks like we did it!
[00:25.340 --> 00:28.180]  October 23rd, we're here right before the episode!
[00:28.560 --> 00:29.240]  Nick, we did it!
[00:30.280 --> 00:33.800]  Okay, guys, Sloppy Joe's Bingo!
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.220]  On Halloween, October 31st, it's happening!
[00:39.740 --> 00:41.880]  It's at 9 p.m. Central!
[00:42.140 --> 00:46.680]  You have to go to twitch.tv slash the regulation pod to play along!
[00:46.960 --> 00:50.120]  We're gonna be drafting our cards for Falcons!
[00:50.480 --> 00:51.880]  Nick! Nick, hold us steady!
[00:52.100 --> 00:54.780]  We have to let the people know about Sloppy Joe's Bingo!
[00:55.280 --> 00:57.320]  Nick! Nick, we have to go!
[00:59.780 --> 01:04.000]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:04.280 --> 01:06.240]  This is episode 24.
[01:06.620 --> 01:07.560]  My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.420]  With me, as always, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour, Andrew Panton, Gavin Frey.
[01:12.960 --> 01:13.100]  Hello.
[01:13.500 --> 01:13.520]  24.
[01:15.040 --> 01:16.500]  That feels low.
[01:16.980 --> 01:17.980]  That was a big sigh.
[01:18.620 --> 01:19.400]  Why are you sad?
[01:20.200 --> 01:20.960]  Shot myself.
[01:22.600 --> 01:24.440]  Jesus, at the fucking gate.
[01:24.980 --> 01:25.460]  Immediately.
[01:27.080 --> 01:29.160]  Just immediately taking it there.
[01:29.240 --> 01:30.500]  Something I've never done before.
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.940]  Maybe my first one in a decade.
[01:33.380 --> 01:35.720]  I... I shat my foot.
[01:35.820 --> 01:36.720]  Oh, God.
[01:37.720 --> 01:39.440]  I wasn't ready for that!
[01:41.020 --> 01:42.460]  I'm not ready for it.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.720]  I think, generally.
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.060]  We can come back to it if you want.
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.600]  No, we've already gone too far.
[01:49.340 --> 01:51.500]  I was not expecting that.
[01:52.040 --> 01:56.360]  I like how last week started with a picture of piss that wasn't actually piss, and then I...
[01:56.360 --> 01:56.580]  Oh, God.
[01:56.980 --> 01:57.440]  Yeah.
[01:57.440 --> 02:00.560]  Do not show a photo of shit that's actually shit!
[02:01.080 --> 02:03.480]  Don't worry, I didn't take a picture. It was horrendous.
[02:03.700 --> 02:04.900]  Jesus Christ.
[02:05.300 --> 02:06.460]  What happened?
[02:07.320 --> 02:08.580]  Uh, I was editing.
[02:08.920 --> 02:09.760]  Having a little edit.
[02:10.140 --> 02:13.320]  And I thought, ooh, a little pump of air about to come out.
[02:13.860 --> 02:14.600]  Oh, God.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.600]  Rolled the dice on it.
[02:16.760 --> 02:18.760]  And it didn't actually feel like anything went wrong.
[02:19.220 --> 02:22.400]  It just felt like the beginning of a fart, but without the end.
[02:23.500 --> 02:24.500]  I was like, huh.
[02:25.280 --> 02:25.980]  And then...
[02:26.640 --> 02:29.060]  Then I looked down, shat my foot.
[02:34.200 --> 02:36.620]  It blew through the old undies, it blew through the shorts.
[02:36.620 --> 02:37.500]  Oh, God.
[02:38.560 --> 02:42.760]  And I sat on my foot, because I'm just in my chair.
[02:43.620 --> 02:45.440]  I just shat on the palm of my foot.
[02:45.740 --> 02:46.780]  I don't know what that bit's called.
[02:47.220 --> 02:48.380]  What's the palm of your foot called?
[02:49.200 --> 02:50.100]  Middle of my foot.
[02:51.620 --> 02:52.980]  Had to hop to the...
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.620]  Hop to the bathroom.
[02:56.620 --> 02:57.580]  I don't like it.
[02:58.260 --> 02:59.540]  What do you do?
[02:59.660 --> 03:03.480]  Do you just crawl into the bathtub or do you stick your foot in the toilet?
[03:04.860 --> 03:06.000]  What's the move?
[03:06.120 --> 03:07.200]  I just got straight in the shower.
[03:07.600 --> 03:08.460]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:10.340 --> 03:11.840]  What a way to start your day.
[03:12.220 --> 03:13.360]  Did it get on your chair?
[03:14.160 --> 03:16.900]  No, if I hadn't been sat on my foot.
[03:17.560 --> 03:18.960]  Oh, next is barefoot or socks.
[03:19.060 --> 03:19.920]  It was through socks.
[03:23.300 --> 03:27.180]  So you shit underwear, pants and socks.
[03:27.180 --> 03:28.840]  Yeah, underneath of sock.
[03:29.980 --> 03:31.160]  Something I've never done.
[03:32.920 --> 03:34.160]  I feel embarrassed.
[03:34.380 --> 03:35.380]  I don't even know why.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.840]  I had Chinese food.
[03:37.100 --> 03:38.080]  I don't think that's the reason.
[03:39.360 --> 03:42.680]  Were you editing something for this or a different thing?
[03:43.020 --> 03:43.600]  Different thing.
[03:43.920 --> 03:44.240]  Okay.
[03:44.700 --> 03:45.420]  Was it disturbing?
[03:46.660 --> 03:47.100]  Yeah.
[03:48.840 --> 03:51.420]  No, I mean the thing you were editing, not shitting yourself.
[03:51.920 --> 03:53.260]  Yeah, I showed it to you last week.
[03:53.400 --> 03:53.560]  Do you remember?
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.620]  Oh, well, maybe that's why you shit yourself.
[03:57.180 --> 03:59.560]  You scared yourself into shitting yourself?
[04:00.340 --> 04:03.660]  You disturbed yourself into self-crapulence.
[04:05.160 --> 04:08.140]  Self-crapulence is a great combination.
[04:08.680 --> 04:09.540]  Is that the name of the episode?
[04:09.700 --> 04:10.540]  I think it is.
[04:10.880 --> 04:12.620]  And this is going to be real tough to beat.
[04:13.420 --> 04:15.120]  24 self-crapulence.
[04:15.240 --> 04:16.240]  Anyone else got any notes?
[04:16.240 --> 04:19.660]  It's like a softer version of self-immolation as a protest.
[04:21.040 --> 04:25.740]  In protest, a bunch of people just fill their pants.
[04:25.740 --> 04:28.300]  Just shit themselves in public.
[04:30.100 --> 04:31.900]  I have a technical note.
[04:32.120 --> 04:33.260]  I learned something.
[04:33.960 --> 04:34.200]  Okay.
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.760]  We're talking about emails.
[04:36.780 --> 04:38.620]  Last week, my email problems.
[04:39.520 --> 04:46.000]  I have learned a very useful email feature that I have not been using.
[04:46.160 --> 04:48.000]  That has been a problem for me.
[04:48.460 --> 04:48.800]  Go ahead.
[04:50.420 --> 04:53.800]  So, you know, when somebody...
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.340]  Here, let me... I screenshotted it.
[04:55.340 --> 04:59.720]  I had Eric send me an email a moment ago before we did this.
[05:00.080 --> 05:04.340]  I was complaining to my partner that when you get an email,
[05:04.620 --> 05:08.140]  and sometimes, you know, emails can be substantially long,
[05:09.320 --> 05:15.040]  that when you hit reply, everything goes away and you just see this.
[05:16.000 --> 05:22.880]  And then I would have to try to remember what it is that the person said and what I was replying to.
[05:22.880 --> 05:31.760]  So sometimes I would copy and paste emails and then drag them into my notes app so I could reflect.
[05:32.640 --> 05:37.740]  So I could see what was being said and reference it in writing my replies.
[05:38.280 --> 05:40.480]  You're not built for a corporate world.
[05:41.200 --> 05:46.180]  As I was making this complaint, they clicked those three dots.
[05:46.300 --> 05:50.800]  Oh, you mean the universal something's been shortened for your convenience?
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.160]  Let's expand it button?
[05:53.580 --> 05:56.300]  Typically, they're... I'm not even going to try to defend it. I just didn't know.
[05:56.480 --> 05:58.960]  I never clicked it. It always bothered me.
[05:59.460 --> 06:05.160]  I'd have to go back and forth from my drafts to the email or I would copy and paste it.
[06:05.700 --> 06:08.740]  And this has been a real game changer for me this past week.
[06:09.060 --> 06:12.700]  So you would paste it into the email?
[06:13.220 --> 06:15.940]  No, I would... No, that would actually make even more sense.
[06:16.060 --> 06:20.320]  I would copy and paste the base email, take it to my notes app,
[06:20.880 --> 06:25.800]  post it as a note, and then write a reply in the notes app to the email,
[06:26.060 --> 06:28.000]  and then copy and paste my reply.
[06:28.340 --> 06:32.920]  When it comes to getting around these problems with your Band-Aid solutions,
[06:33.320 --> 06:37.100]  I think you're a genius. You get around every problem that faces you.
[06:37.380 --> 06:41.720]  However, do you not think that most people wouldn't do that?
[06:41.960 --> 06:45.060]  And there would clearly, surely be a simpler way.
[06:46.220 --> 06:49.840]  It once again is how my brain works is this is an issue.
[06:49.840 --> 06:51.040]  Oh, I solved it.
[06:51.240 --> 06:55.300]  Why would there be an issue for the entire planet? Why would that be there?
[06:55.820 --> 06:58.380]  I guess I just don't think about people in that way.
[06:59.660 --> 07:02.520]  I'll say this about Andrew and his approach to life.
[07:03.620 --> 07:05.060]  How old are you now, Andrew?
[07:05.720 --> 07:06.080]  30.
[07:06.420 --> 07:11.140]  Yeah, you're 30 years old. So much of the world is yet undiscovered to you
[07:11.140 --> 07:14.420]  in a way that most adults don't get to experience.
[07:14.640 --> 07:18.760]  It's kind of like how I refused to play PlayStation for like three entire
[07:18.760 --> 07:23.360]  PlayStations, and now I get to discover God of War and Uncharted and all of these games.
[07:23.360 --> 07:26.860]  And it's like a whole new world for me. That's you with just like life shit.
[07:27.460 --> 07:29.500]  And I bet that keeps you young.
[07:30.400 --> 07:35.140]  It was such an exciting moment to realize I could just reference the email within the email,
[07:35.380 --> 07:36.540]  like knowing how to do that.
[07:36.840 --> 07:37.900]  But of course you can.
[07:38.340 --> 07:42.320]  Here's the thing that I know that makes sense for me.
[07:42.380 --> 07:46.740]  It's always like a justification of I've done something to this that I just don't.
[07:46.740 --> 07:50.600]  I don't understand. Or I've got a weird app or there's just...
[07:50.600 --> 07:54.500]  I'm not thinking everyone is necessarily living the same scenario that I am,
[07:54.740 --> 07:57.140]  but I am living this scenario. And how can I remedy this?
[07:57.560 --> 08:01.460]  Did you know that in a lot of email apps, if you select text and then hit reply,
[08:01.560 --> 08:03.340]  it just quotes that selected text?
[08:03.940 --> 08:06.020]  I don't even understand the words you just said.
[08:06.860 --> 08:09.000]  Let me open up my email app.
[08:10.260 --> 08:10.740]  Gmail.
[08:12.400 --> 08:15.180]  Okay, so I highlight it and then I hit reply.
[08:16.020 --> 08:16.460]  Yep.
[08:17.520 --> 08:18.120]  It did nothing.
[08:18.580 --> 08:20.340]  Why are you in the browser? You're in the browser, right?
[08:20.720 --> 08:21.960]  No, I'm on the phone app.
[08:22.440 --> 08:22.660]  Oh.
[08:23.940 --> 08:29.140]  I'm exclusively a phone app email guy. I don't think I ever use the browser.
[08:29.460 --> 08:34.360]  Is that because you can't log into what you called the posted stamp last time?
[08:34.520 --> 08:35.300]  And so you...
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.700]  The safari postage stamp?
[08:37.420 --> 08:40.280]  Sometimes. Well, no, it's just, you know, if I need to check something,
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.900]  I'll Google Gmail and then I'll go through that way.
[08:43.140 --> 08:43.580]  What?
[08:44.300 --> 08:44.700]  Wait, what?
[08:44.700 --> 08:48.020]  You'll Google? What? Hang on. You'll Google Gmail?
[08:48.880 --> 08:50.900]  Yeah, you Google Gmail to get the Gmail.
[08:51.480 --> 08:52.300]  Oh, you just go to Gmail.
[08:52.760 --> 08:54.140]  Jelf. Jeff. Jeff, help.
[08:54.200 --> 08:54.560]  Jelf?
[08:54.600 --> 08:57.660]  Jeff. Jeff, help.
[08:58.760 --> 09:01.020]  You can just... do you not...
[09:02.080 --> 09:04.120]  Oh, do I click the name? No.
[09:04.880 --> 09:06.140]  Wait, what's your browser?
[09:06.780 --> 09:07.960]  Chrome. I use Chrome.
[09:07.960 --> 09:09.180]  You would say...
[09:12.140 --> 09:14.780]  So the address bar, the address bar, right?
[09:15.160 --> 09:15.360]  Right.
[09:15.680 --> 09:16.600]  That's Google.
[09:16.920 --> 09:17.280]  Yeah.
[09:17.940 --> 09:19.260]  Type Gmail in it.
[09:19.700 --> 09:20.100]  I do.
[09:21.340 --> 09:23.220]  I just searched Gmail.
[09:24.260 --> 09:27.140]  And now I'm on the Google page.
[09:32.360 --> 09:33.860]  And then I click Gmail.
[09:34.260 --> 09:35.780]  I can't wait to do this supplemental.
[09:36.360 --> 09:39.540]  Yeah, we're doing a supplemental. I have notes of technical problems.
[09:39.860 --> 09:40.980]  That's a lot of... man.
[09:41.740 --> 09:46.580]  We can streamline your life in such dramatic ways.
[09:47.080 --> 09:49.300]  Andrew, what are you going to do with all your extra time?
[09:49.440 --> 09:52.460]  I bet I can free up at least an hour a day for you.
[09:52.860 --> 09:53.260]  Really?
[09:53.760 --> 09:54.660]  Yeah, what are you going to do with it?
[09:56.420 --> 09:58.260]  What do you never have time for?
[10:00.440 --> 10:02.120]  What do I never have time for?
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.180]  I'm pretty good at finding time for things.
[10:04.180 --> 10:05.840]  Do you have a thing where it's like,
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.960]  Oh, I need like a good chunk of time to do that. I haven't started it yet.
[10:10.980 --> 10:12.940]  Uh, I mean, a few of those. Yeah.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.300]  I mean, I hear good things about One Piece, but that's long.
[10:21.040 --> 10:23.920]  It's a lot of shows. It's a lot of like big season shows.
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.720]  I've been meaning to go through Seinfeld again, but that's a lot of seasons.
[10:27.780 --> 10:27.940]  Nine.
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.140]  Nine. See, that's a lot.
[10:31.160 --> 10:34.120]  TV series are intimidating to me, so I'd probably watch a different show.
[10:34.180 --> 10:36.620]  I'd probably add a new show to the list.
[10:39.080 --> 10:42.280]  I wasn't expecting your answer just to be, I'll watch another show.
[10:43.340 --> 10:46.360]  I'm pretty good at finding time for the stuff that's important.
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.460]  Gavin, you've given me the gift of below deck Mediterranean season six.
[10:53.740 --> 10:57.660]  I guess more time with family. I don't know. What's the answer you would like?
[11:01.880 --> 11:03.240]  What do you want from me here?
[11:04.260 --> 11:06.200]  Because I'm willing to say that I now have time.
[11:06.640 --> 11:09.840]  Now that I have time for things, Gavin, how do you think I should use this time
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.160]  that you've gifted me?
[11:11.540 --> 11:13.320]  I'll use it however you want. I just thought you would say like,
[11:13.380 --> 11:16.620]  oh, there's like a DIY project or I need to clean this thing.
[11:16.760 --> 11:17.040]  DIY.
[11:17.700 --> 11:20.040]  Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, I could do some cleaning. That's fair.
[11:21.860 --> 11:23.920]  Yeah, I mean, you can always clean.
[11:25.280 --> 11:27.760]  Dust is endless. It just keeps coming.
[11:27.760 --> 11:29.260]  Uh-huh.
[11:30.060 --> 11:34.280]  You're not really selling him on on speeding and improving his life.
[11:34.400 --> 11:37.660]  If you're you're you're you're big winning point here, Gavin is like,
[11:37.680 --> 11:40.960]  I'm going to give you so much more time to clean throughout the day.
[11:42.140 --> 11:43.560]  Well, he needs to clean.
[11:44.600 --> 11:45.720]  Everybody needs to clean.
[11:46.160 --> 11:46.940]  Yeah, it's not.
[11:47.100 --> 11:51.740]  I mean, aren't you like ankle deep in your own shit and cat piss right now?
[11:51.960 --> 11:55.400]  Yep. Stay on top of it, though. It's already gone.
[11:56.280 --> 12:01.100]  I my I'm sitting four feet from where my dog threw up an hour ago.
[12:01.840 --> 12:03.880]  It was such a fluid morning.
[12:04.240 --> 12:07.060]  Five minutes before we started recording Predator.
[12:07.740 --> 12:09.240]  Andrew, what are you sat on at the moment?
[12:09.800 --> 12:13.780]  I got a I got a new chair that sucks. It's terrible. Terrible chair.
[12:14.220 --> 12:15.380]  I don't know what I'm going to do.
[12:15.820 --> 12:18.520]  I think we can fix your your your Herman Miller.
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.400]  I there's apparently like a code or something on it that you call.
[12:22.500 --> 12:23.400]  I need to check that.
[12:23.400 --> 12:26.640]  There also were I saw the subreddit thread about it,
[12:26.700 --> 12:29.880]  and there were a ton of suggestions of of chairs that might work for you.
[12:30.080 --> 12:30.540]  I saw in there.
[12:30.760 --> 12:31.480]  I saw that. Yeah.
[12:31.800 --> 12:32.000]  Yeah.
[12:32.160 --> 12:34.960]  I like that you would immediately after that conversation
[12:34.960 --> 12:37.600]  came up with a thing that you need time to do.
[12:37.940 --> 12:39.700]  Oh, I should do that. I should look at that.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.040]  That's it.
[12:42.200 --> 12:43.360]  Seinfeld season two.
[12:43.640 --> 12:44.360]  Here we go.
[12:45.940 --> 12:49.080]  Where did you get your current chair from then, Andrew?
[12:49.440 --> 12:49.840]  Amazon.
[12:51.640 --> 12:52.520]  Oh, yeah.
[12:54.180 --> 12:54.740]  Unfortunate.
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.380]  It's an unfortunate decision.
[12:56.940 --> 12:59.140]  What what's what's lacking about it?
[13:00.540 --> 13:03.600]  I'm proportionally weird, and it just doesn't.
[13:04.180 --> 13:06.100]  It just doesn't fit my lifestyle.
[13:06.340 --> 13:08.760]  Doesn't fit me in a way that it's comfortable.
[13:09.080 --> 13:10.260]  Doesn't fit your long back.
[13:10.320 --> 13:14.080]  It's yeah, it's the combination of short legs and long back
[13:14.080 --> 13:16.060]  and the way that the seat is shaped.
[13:16.140 --> 13:17.700]  It just is not working.
[13:18.280 --> 13:20.420]  I'm sitting on like the front of the seat.
[13:20.420 --> 13:25.920]  It's sort of imagine like a seat that I could just put a photo of the seat.
[13:26.020 --> 13:28.500]  It looks a lot comfier, though, I think.
[13:29.020 --> 13:33.660]  Have you ever seen those Instagram ads where they you you buy that product,
[13:33.700 --> 13:38.780]  they send you the the sheets of like weird blue gel and you put your feet in the gel
[13:38.780 --> 13:42.680]  and then you send it back to them and then they give you like a foot insert
[13:42.680 --> 13:45.860]  that's perfectly molded to you to like help with I don't know,
[13:45.880 --> 13:48.200]  like sciatica or whatever kind of foot pain.
[13:48.200 --> 13:50.000]  You think it should lie down in one?
[13:50.260 --> 13:53.060]  I'm wondering if there's a chair version of that for Andrew,
[13:53.560 --> 13:57.840]  where you go and you sit into it and then you sink into like the weird goop
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.220]  and then it solidifies like silicone or whatever,
[14:00.300 --> 14:02.060]  and then they build a chair out of that mold.
[14:03.080 --> 14:04.960]  I feel like you'd get suctioned in there.
[14:05.280 --> 14:06.200]  It'd be hard to get out of it.
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.080]  Well, I'm sure they have the technology.
[14:09.600 --> 14:12.280]  So you see that front like ass lip on it?
[14:12.680 --> 14:13.420]  Yeah. Oh, wow.
[14:13.740 --> 14:15.500]  Yeah, I have a hard time like clearing.
[14:15.500 --> 14:20.100]  I end up on that a lot because my legs hit the chair.
[14:20.280 --> 14:22.100]  Are the arms too narrow?
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.040]  No, they're fine. Arms fine.
[14:24.340 --> 14:25.620]  How important is rolling?
[14:26.400 --> 14:27.880]  Well, yeah, that's the problem.
[14:27.940 --> 14:30.180]  The chair rolls away from me when I try to sit on it.
[14:30.300 --> 14:32.780]  Because if you're having trouble because your legs are short,
[14:32.960 --> 14:34.540]  why don't you just take the wheels off of it?
[14:35.480 --> 14:38.540]  Because then it just it's like skids, right?
[14:39.240 --> 14:40.780]  Are you on its lowest setting?
[14:41.120 --> 14:41.920]  I am. Yeah.
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.000]  Why don't you get one of those plastic chair mats for the ground
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.340]  so you don't scuff your floor up?
[14:47.740 --> 14:48.540]  That's not a bad idea.
[14:48.780 --> 14:50.240]  And then you could take the wheels off
[14:50.240 --> 14:53.080]  and then it'll be lower to the ground and it can't scoot away from you.
[14:53.600 --> 14:55.000]  That is not a bad idea.
[14:55.380 --> 14:57.400]  Have you tried pushing the chair against a wall,
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.400]  then getting in it and shimmying back over to the desk?
[15:00.700 --> 15:03.100]  I kind of do that already with the bed.
[15:03.420 --> 15:05.000]  I use the bed behind me.
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.180]  Uh, the bed slowly inches closer towards the desk with every night
[15:12.180 --> 15:13.840]  and then I have to push the bed back.
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.560]  But there are times in which the bed is directly behind the chair
[15:18.560 --> 15:20.200]  and it makes it very easy to do that.
[15:20.820 --> 15:23.800]  Has the uncomfortable chair been causing more tub time than normal?
[15:24.420 --> 15:25.200]  Uh, no.
[15:26.180 --> 15:27.240]  Well, no, that's not true.
[15:27.320 --> 15:27.540]  Yes.
[15:27.900 --> 15:28.520]  Only because...
[15:30.120 --> 15:31.160]  Only because...
[15:31.160 --> 15:32.960]  Like I want to...
[15:33.880 --> 15:36.940]  Does the chair exacerbate any other issues?
[15:37.200 --> 15:39.280]  Like, how are the ankles in all this?
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.840]  Ankles are great. Everything is great.
[15:41.240 --> 15:43.380]  It's just all butt pain.
[15:43.660 --> 15:44.440]  Just not comfy.
[15:44.880 --> 15:45.940]  It's not comfy to sit on.
[15:46.320 --> 15:49.560]  But you're not, you're not like overcompensating in another area
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.580]  and then, you know, like weakening your knees or ankles or anything like that.
[15:52.600 --> 15:53.580]  No, not that I'm aware of.
[15:53.680 --> 15:54.240]  Yeah, it's all good.
[15:54.260 --> 15:55.180]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[15:55.820 --> 15:56.540]  All good.
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.160]  Speaking of pain, though.
[15:59.640 --> 16:02.400]  I saw something that I feel would be very validating.
[16:02.500 --> 16:03.000]  You, Jeff.
[16:03.240 --> 16:04.440]  I don't know if you've seen this.
[16:04.960 --> 16:06.320]  Because you're a big Howard Stern guy.
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.920]  It was Howard Stern interviewing 50 Cent about what it feels like to get shot in the face.
[16:13.160 --> 16:14.000]  Have you seen this clip?
[16:14.540 --> 16:15.120]  No, I have not.
[16:15.680 --> 16:20.700]  I mean, I remember, I remember the interview from like 20 years ago or whatever.
[16:20.820 --> 16:21.660]  I remember that it happened.
[16:22.920 --> 16:24.320]  But I don't remember the specific.
[16:24.460 --> 16:28.000]  He was asking 50 Cent what it was like to get shot in the face and how painful it is.
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.120]  50 Cent was having a hard time articulating the specifics of that.
[16:33.180 --> 16:35.780]  Yeah, it's that interview that Eric just posted a photo of.
[16:35.980 --> 16:37.400]  50 Cent talks getting shot nine times.
[16:38.420 --> 16:44.220]  He was struggling to discuss the specific feel of getting shot in the face, what it is like,
[16:44.860 --> 16:46.160]  and equating it to pain.
[16:46.960 --> 16:53.660]  And in the process of trying to explain it, he was like, it doesn't necessarily hurt an
[16:53.660 --> 16:54.500]  extreme amount.
[16:55.120 --> 16:59.440]  Like going to the dentist and getting a root canal is significantly worse.
[16:59.900 --> 17:00.460]  Hell yeah!
[17:00.780 --> 17:03.480]  You have experienced worse pain, Jeff.
[17:03.620 --> 17:07.000]  I've been shot like seven times in the last three years.
[17:07.480 --> 17:07.920]  It's incredible.
[17:08.540 --> 17:09.660]  You've made it through a lot more.
[17:09.960 --> 17:14.780]  No more mouth bullets for me, but that's that is exceptionally validating, Andrew.
[17:14.900 --> 17:15.260]  Thank you.
[17:15.320 --> 17:17.780]  No more drive by candy towards me, please.
[17:18.320 --> 17:19.960]  I assume it's like an adrenaline thing.
[17:20.580 --> 17:20.860]  Maybe.
[17:21.000 --> 17:21.280]  Yeah.
[17:21.340 --> 17:22.220]  And I just don't know.
[17:22.220 --> 17:25.420]  Are there a lot of pain sensors in your face?
[17:26.740 --> 17:27.700]  Pain sensors?
[17:28.160 --> 17:28.380]  Nerves.
[17:28.520 --> 17:29.420]  Yeah, yeah.
[17:29.800 --> 17:32.400]  Listen, we were just playing Predator.
[17:32.560 --> 17:33.940]  Okay, I'm big on the pain sensor.
[17:34.100 --> 17:36.240]  That's my build when I play Predator.
[17:37.980 --> 17:39.920]  The pain sensors, aka nerves.
[17:41.400 --> 17:43.320]  It was clear what I was talking about.
[17:43.620 --> 17:44.520]  I got it completely.
[17:44.780 --> 17:45.100]  I got it.
[17:45.100 --> 17:45.740]  I'm on your side.
[17:46.680 --> 17:47.900]  Don't nerves sense pain?
[17:48.280 --> 17:51.280]  On a technical level, didn't I describe them correctly?
[17:51.840 --> 17:52.200]  100%.
[17:52.200 --> 17:53.280]  I guess they feel pain.
[17:53.340 --> 17:54.240]  They don't really sense it.
[17:54.340 --> 17:55.520]  It's not like pain's coming.
[17:55.720 --> 17:56.060]  Pain receptors.
[17:57.060 --> 18:00.240]  Just like if you wanted to buy food, you could go to a food store.
[18:01.000 --> 18:01.760]  That is true.
[18:02.600 --> 18:03.100]  I mean, I don't know.
[18:03.140 --> 18:04.660]  Like, do you mean a grocery store?
[18:05.020 --> 18:06.300]  Or there's some confusion.
[18:06.700 --> 18:08.680]  I guess anything could be a food store that has food.
[18:08.680 --> 18:09.160]  A different kind.
[18:09.340 --> 18:09.980]  Yeah, that's fair.
[18:11.340 --> 18:12.940]  I have plenty of other notes.
[18:13.100 --> 18:16.300]  I just I was pausing for a minute to let you guys interject.
[18:16.500 --> 18:18.320]  You want me to just keep going on notes I have?
[18:18.640 --> 18:20.880]  Uh, I got one note and it's so bad.
[18:20.880 --> 18:22.040]  I don't think I'm going to say it.
[18:22.160 --> 18:24.920]  Okay, well, I have a thing I'm very excited to talk about.
[18:25.280 --> 18:26.160]  We're all idiots.
[18:26.820 --> 18:27.500]  We're dumb.
[18:28.360 --> 18:30.800]  How did none of us just Google Gmail?
[18:31.360 --> 18:31.720]  No.
[18:31.840 --> 18:34.720]  How did none of us Google Regulation Store?
[18:34.840 --> 18:38.420]  Have you seen all the posts about what happens when you just Google Regulation Store?
[18:39.040 --> 18:40.720]  Why would you Google Regulation Store?
[18:40.860 --> 18:43.280]  Why would you Google it when we gave you like three URLs?
[18:43.560 --> 18:45.120]  We're not stupid, Andrew.
[18:45.280 --> 18:46.200]  I want to be really clear.
[18:46.460 --> 18:47.460]  We're not stupid.
[18:47.480 --> 18:48.160]  I did say it was taken.
[18:48.780 --> 18:49.700]  Yeah, we did say it was taken.
[18:49.700 --> 18:52.960]  And we say go to regulationstore.store or regulationstore.com.
[18:53.260 --> 18:55.360]  Yeah, I feel like we were incredibly clear.
[18:55.460 --> 18:57.020]  I'm not sure why you would Google it.
[18:57.040 --> 18:57.360]  Hang on.
[18:57.400 --> 18:58.640]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[18:58.740 --> 18:59.160]  You wait.
[18:59.440 --> 19:03.020]  Because I don't know why we would give you a URL and then you would Google it.
[19:05.000 --> 19:10.560]  I just the fact that none of us tried just to see what would be there is, I think, wild.
[19:10.840 --> 19:12.480]  That none of us tested it just to see.
[19:12.780 --> 19:13.440]  Maybe someone did.
[19:13.500 --> 19:14.280]  I certainly didn't.
[19:14.900 --> 19:16.040]  That is how I Google things.
[19:16.120 --> 19:18.220]  Like I am the person that would search in that way.
[19:18.220 --> 19:20.180]  And it did not cross my mind.
[19:20.500 --> 19:24.040]  It sounds like the point of failure in this was you.
[19:24.640 --> 19:25.760]  Yeah, I don't know.
[19:25.820 --> 19:27.300]  What else should we have Googled?
[19:27.820 --> 19:31.000]  Like, just try Googling it once just to see.
[19:31.100 --> 19:32.220]  Like, I don't think we did anything.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.760]  I think everything is correct.
[19:34.360 --> 19:39.360]  It's the fact that I was blindsided by the fact that when you search regulation store,
[19:39.500 --> 19:42.460]  it leads to a bondage sex shop in the UK.
[19:44.160 --> 19:45.460]  Which is perfect, man.
[19:45.460 --> 19:48.480]  That's what a regulation store in the UK is.
[19:51.240 --> 19:53.060]  Gavin, is that the base store?
[19:53.940 --> 19:55.940]  It's that and pubs and charity shops.
[20:00.280 --> 20:02.740]  You buy bondage gear at a Greggs?
[20:02.880 --> 20:08.080]  I just Googled regulation cup and it took me to gulfsupplydirect.com.
[20:08.180 --> 20:11.320]  Is that something we're going to have to contend with when we release the Gerpler?
[20:11.440 --> 20:13.360]  No, because we don't have any regulation cups.
[20:13.480 --> 20:14.260]  What are you talking about?
[20:14.400 --> 20:15.000]  We will.
[20:15.000 --> 20:15.680]  We will.
[20:15.720 --> 20:16.540]  Come November.
[20:17.460 --> 20:22.560]  What I'm saying is that I firmly stand by this, that we only gave URLs.
[20:22.820 --> 20:27.100]  I don't know why you would Google regulation store when we gave you two URLs to go to.
[20:27.280 --> 20:28.200]  It's crazy.
[20:28.640 --> 20:30.320]  That is the craziest way for people to go.
[20:30.660 --> 20:34.960]  Also, probably, I've never done it, but probably don't Google Gerpler.
[20:35.940 --> 20:37.740]  Oh, Gerpler is probably a real bad one.
[20:37.860 --> 20:40.520]  I don't think that's going to get you anything you're looking for.
[20:40.560 --> 20:41.780]  Something to think about, I guess.
[20:41.940 --> 20:43.000]  I'm just going to go on a whim.
[20:43.680 --> 20:44.300]  Now I got to do it.
[20:44.300 --> 20:45.460]  Yeah, what is Gerpler?
[20:46.680 --> 20:47.920]  Is .gerpler available?
[20:51.120 --> 20:52.440]  Oh, it's pretty wholesome.
[20:52.880 --> 20:54.740]  It's just a bunch of pictures of the Gerpler.
[20:55.200 --> 20:55.940]  It's mostly just us.
[20:56.020 --> 20:57.100]  Oh, it's us?
[20:57.180 --> 20:57.820]  We've claimed it?
[20:58.040 --> 20:59.280]  Yeah, we own it.
[20:59.380 --> 20:59.820]  Hell yeah.
[21:00.380 --> 21:03.280]  But this is how we're going to take regulation store by Googling it also.
[21:03.900 --> 21:06.740]  So I stand by, we did nothing wrong.
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.500]  We are smart.
[21:08.140 --> 21:09.660]  And I blame everyone else.
[21:09.960 --> 21:10.160]  The end.
[21:10.320 --> 21:10.840]  Yeah, fair.
[21:10.980 --> 21:11.540]  Fair enough.
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.860]  I was just shocked by it.
[21:13.860 --> 21:16.880]  What a weird name for a sex shop.
[21:17.260 --> 21:20.180]  It's the most mundane word.
[21:20.960 --> 21:21.960]  That's probably what they were going for.
[21:22.460 --> 21:23.100]  I guess so.
[21:23.580 --> 21:26.920]  I think it's why the guy picked James Bond as the name, even though he's a spy.
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.420]  It's like the most boring name you could find.
[21:30.080 --> 21:32.600]  You mean the author or like within universe?
[21:33.520 --> 21:37.440]  Yeah, Ian Fleming looked at his books and there was like a bird watching book by someone
[21:37.440 --> 21:38.380]  called James Bond.
[21:39.220 --> 21:40.820]  James Bond is a bird watcher?
[21:41.380 --> 21:42.400]  Wait, I don't know.
[21:42.520 --> 21:43.840]  I don't know about any of this.
[21:43.960 --> 21:45.160]  That's why he chose the name.
[21:45.240 --> 21:46.380]  And the guy watches birds.
[21:46.580 --> 21:47.840]  I think it's something like that.
[21:48.040 --> 21:50.940]  I think it was like an ornithology thing.
[21:52.880 --> 21:55.600]  Ian Fleming, James Bond name.
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.320]  If you're if you're Googling this, you need to be careful.
[21:58.400 --> 21:59.580]  It might take you to a sex shop.
[21:59.780 --> 22:00.480]  You never know.
[22:02.260 --> 22:04.220]  Don't Google James Bondage.
[22:06.320 --> 22:10.720]  Oh, this isn't this is just this is him explaining the character, which is not
[22:10.720 --> 22:15.680]  what I want. Bond was a compound of all three of all the secret agents and commando types
[22:15.680 --> 22:16.600]  I met during the war.
[22:16.700 --> 22:18.000]  That is not a bird watcher.
[22:18.020 --> 22:18.880]  I'm here for bird watching.
[22:19.460 --> 22:23.740]  I'm here for books because it's interesting because James Bond, I would argue now is a
[22:23.740 --> 22:24.580]  very cool name.
[22:24.820 --> 22:26.220]  But because of the character.
[22:26.640 --> 22:27.300]  He cooled it up.
[22:27.580 --> 22:32.060]  It's hard to imagine a time in which James Bond was viewed as a lame name.
[22:32.500 --> 22:37.500]  According to Google's AI overview, Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bond, chose the name
[22:37.500 --> 22:42.780]  for his fictional secret agent from the cover of Birds of the West Indies by American
[22:42.780 --> 22:44.720]  ornithologist James Bond.
[22:45.100 --> 22:48.060]  Fucking James Bond is American, you bitches.
[22:51.300 --> 22:52.780]  We're taking him back.
[22:53.500 --> 22:59.360]  I wonder if and or when they learned that they were James Bond, that they were sourced
[22:59.360 --> 23:00.200]  for James Bond.
[23:00.740 --> 23:01.640]  If he was a live author.
[23:01.920 --> 23:03.760]  Yeah, that's if they were alive.
[23:03.760 --> 23:07.760]  And also like when Ian, I don't know when that came out, but that was how they came
[23:07.760 --> 23:08.800]  up with the idea for that name.
[23:09.220 --> 23:11.620]  Let's look up ornithologist James Bond.
[23:11.640 --> 23:14.960]  Because I would never personally, like even if I wrote a book.
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.760]  Oh dude, this guy's fucking awesome.
[23:17.220 --> 23:17.520]  Yeah?
[23:17.680 --> 23:18.600]  You found a picture of him?
[23:18.740 --> 23:20.320]  Oh dude, I'm about to send it to you, hold on.
[23:20.800 --> 23:21.820]  Are we about to get Brimley'd?
[23:22.920 --> 23:24.500]  Oh, this guy's pretty cool.
[23:25.360 --> 23:26.240]  Pretty fucking cool.
[23:26.500 --> 23:30.920]  Now that's that's a guy who could take on Oddjob and Jaws at the same time.
[23:31.260 --> 23:34.380]  He definitely, he definitely knew.
[23:34.580 --> 23:42.200]  This motherfucker lived from January 4th, 1900 to February 14th, 1989.
[23:43.260 --> 23:44.340]  Holy shit.
[23:44.680 --> 23:46.300]  He had to have known.
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.240]  He's from Philadelphia.
[23:49.380 --> 23:50.280]  Fictional namesake.
[23:50.860 --> 23:52.180]  Oh, it's even in his bio.
[23:52.800 --> 23:57.340]  The spy James Bond wrapped in Dr. Doolittle, which is a combo I'd never considered, but
[23:57.340 --> 23:58.080]  I really like.
[23:58.960 --> 24:05.980]  James Bond just sending birds after Oddjob, stealing his hat, flying away with it so he
[24:05.980 --> 24:07.080]  can't use it anymore.
[24:09.660 --> 24:11.280]  That's so, I had no idea, Gavin.
[24:11.420 --> 24:12.240]  That's a great fact.
[24:12.960 --> 24:13.500]  Yeah, it's not bad.
[24:13.840 --> 24:16.420]  Fleming wrote to the real James Bond's wife,
[24:16.580 --> 24:21.800]  It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon, and yet very masculine name
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.380]  was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born.
[24:25.380 --> 24:30.360]  He did not contact the real James Bond about using his name in the books, and Bond did
[24:30.360 --> 24:36.720]  not learn of Fleming's character until the early 1960s, when Fleming's James Bond books
[24:36.720 --> 24:37.820]  became popular in the U.S.
[24:37.820 --> 24:43.920]  In 1964, during Fleming's annual winter stay at Goldeneye in Jamaica, Bond and his wife
[24:43.920 --> 24:45.720]  visited Fleming unexpectedly.
[24:46.220 --> 24:47.140]  Oh, that's cool.
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.320]  That's so cool.
[24:49.140 --> 24:54.060]  Because that must be such a weird feeling to be like, oh, there's this new franchise and
[24:54.060 --> 24:55.120]  the main character has my name.
[24:55.380 --> 24:58.740]  Suddenly being like, oh, he's literally named after me.
[24:59.220 --> 25:00.080]  It keeps going.
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.700]  In his novel Dr. No, Fleming referenced Bond's work by basing a large ornithological sanctuary
[25:06.700 --> 25:08.460]  on Dr. No's island in the Bahamas.
[25:10.600 --> 25:15.940]  In 1964, he gave Bond a first edition copy of You Only Live Twice signed to the real
[25:15.940 --> 25:18.380]  James Bond from the thief of his identity.
[25:19.360 --> 25:22.620]  That is so weird in a great way.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.160]  What a strange thing.
[25:24.160 --> 25:28.020]  That is a thing that nobody would ever believe if you told them conversationally.
[25:28.460 --> 25:31.100]  OK, I'm not going to kill you guys with these, but I have one more that I have to read.
[25:31.140 --> 25:31.620]  Yeah, please.
[25:32.200 --> 25:36.200]  James Bond's wife told Fleming that her husband saw use of his name for the character as a
[25:36.200 --> 25:41.420]  good joke, to which Fleming replied, I can only offer your James Bond unlimited use
[25:41.420 --> 25:43.180]  of the name Ian Fleming in return.
[25:45.200 --> 25:46.720]  Ian Fleming sounds like a funny guy.
[25:47.040 --> 25:47.740]  Yeah, he really does.
[25:47.880 --> 25:49.040]  All right, I'm done with James Bond stuff.
[25:49.140 --> 25:50.320]  But that was that Gavin.
[25:50.380 --> 25:51.240]  That was awesome, man.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.320]  That's really fascinating.
[25:53.260 --> 25:58.420]  It's such a strange one of the most iconic characters in, I would just say, pop culture
[25:58.420 --> 26:00.400]  history, like as a name.
[26:01.120 --> 26:01.820]  It's wild.
[26:02.300 --> 26:04.780]  And he was just on the hunt for like a Smith or something.
[26:05.560 --> 26:08.380]  I wonder if he I wonder if he's into Falcons at all.
[26:08.480 --> 26:09.020]  I bet he was.
[26:09.820 --> 26:10.800]  I bet he had one.
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.040]  You think he had a Falcon?
[26:13.900 --> 26:14.880]  Ah, he must have.
[26:14.940 --> 26:16.460]  I love this regulation universe.
[26:17.400 --> 26:18.980]  We got to do another Falcon event soon.
[26:19.280 --> 26:19.520]  We should.
[26:19.580 --> 26:19.760]  We do.
[26:19.860 --> 26:20.040]  We should.
[26:20.140 --> 26:21.020]  Yeah, or next week.
[26:21.260 --> 26:21.800]  We're doing one.
[26:23.160 --> 26:25.100]  Well, I guess the week that this comes out.
[26:25.360 --> 26:27.280]  So this week may have already happened.
[26:28.460 --> 26:30.820]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[26:31.180 --> 26:34.440]  Checking off the boxes on your to do list is a great feeling.
[26:34.940 --> 26:38.780]  And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you choose an
[26:38.780 --> 26:40.120]  option that's right for you.
[26:40.280 --> 26:44.560]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or using the award winning app.
[26:44.780 --> 26:48.300]  It's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[26:48.700 --> 26:50.560]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[26:53.880 --> 26:55.120]  Hey, it's Paris.
[26:55.500 --> 26:57.620]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[26:57.820 --> 26:58.660]  Like stars.
[26:59.120 --> 26:59.400]  Duh.
[26:59.900 --> 27:03.520]  And thanks to Hilton and Auto Camp, I just slept under them.
[27:04.120 --> 27:09.860]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream, making s'mores with
[27:09.860 --> 27:13.140]  the kids while a national park is our backdrop.
[27:13.920 --> 27:16.180]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[27:16.700 --> 27:17.400]  That's hot.
[27:18.060 --> 27:21.100]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[27:21.440 --> 27:22.820]  Hilton for the stay.
[27:23.380 --> 27:24.840]  I got a news pop up.
[27:25.160 --> 27:25.460]  I enjoy.
[27:25.640 --> 27:26.920]  I sometimes just refresh.
[27:27.200 --> 27:27.440]  Oh, what?
[27:27.600 --> 27:28.500]  Gavin just posted something.
[27:29.020 --> 27:29.520]  Did you post?
[27:30.260 --> 27:30.460]  What?
[27:31.020 --> 27:31.960]  Wait, what?
[27:32.480 --> 27:33.120]  Now it's gone.
[27:33.480 --> 27:36.840]  I was seeing if it would if it would dong me.
[27:37.240 --> 27:37.600]  What?
[27:37.880 --> 27:40.700]  It was like a snail getting electrocuted.
[27:40.980 --> 27:41.500]  What was it?
[27:41.560 --> 27:42.300]  No, it's gone now.
[27:42.440 --> 27:43.580]  I clicked on it really fast.
[27:43.680 --> 27:44.340]  What was that?
[27:44.780 --> 27:48.580]  Basically, I've a clock has appeared in my in my garden.
[27:49.100 --> 27:49.540]  What?
[27:49.760 --> 27:50.160]  It's posted again.
[27:50.380 --> 27:50.940]  I didn't mean to.
[27:51.060 --> 27:52.740]  I didn't mean to override the conversation with this.
[27:53.360 --> 27:57.120]  I can tell what time of day it is because of this.
[27:57.940 --> 27:59.900]  You have a snail.
[28:00.260 --> 28:02.400]  Is that what that or what is that?
[28:02.480 --> 28:02.800]  A unicorn?
[28:03.060 --> 28:04.360]  An inflatable llama.
[28:04.900 --> 28:08.600]  But as the day heats up, it gets more and more erect.
[28:09.120 --> 28:10.740]  And then as it cools down, it goes down.
[28:11.020 --> 28:16.080]  So if based on how how upright it is, I can tell what time it is.
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.600]  You have an erect sundial.
[28:18.100 --> 28:21.700]  It's the first naturally occurring sundial I've ever had.
[28:23.640 --> 28:24.680]  That's so funny.
[28:26.680 --> 28:27.760]  Oh, that's really funny.
[28:27.940 --> 28:30.580]  I kept walking past it in the morning and it would be all slumped over.
[28:30.680 --> 28:31.580]  And then I come back later.
[28:31.640 --> 28:32.740]  I'd be like, who inflated it?
[28:35.140 --> 28:38.760]  Have you charted like the level of inflation per hour?
[28:39.040 --> 28:42.440]  Like, are you able to identify if I showed you a photo of it?
[28:42.480 --> 28:43.880]  Could you be like, that was 6 p.m.?
[28:45.120 --> 28:49.060]  It's really only accurate between like 9 a.m. and noon.
[28:49.240 --> 28:52.140]  And then it's just right for the rest of the day.
[28:52.140 --> 28:54.280]  But I think it's just because it's so hot.
[28:54.560 --> 28:58.380]  And the air expands inside and slightly inflates it.
[28:59.160 --> 29:00.120]  That's so funny.
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.940]  What a great sundial.
[29:02.480 --> 29:03.740]  Yeah, it's pretty good.
[29:04.580 --> 29:05.560]  Is there a way?
[29:06.340 --> 29:10.500]  Is there like an actual product you can buy that tells the time with air?
[29:11.420 --> 29:12.020]  Air heat?
[29:12.400 --> 29:13.020]  Air clock?
[29:13.620 --> 29:14.540]  Yeah, air clock.
[29:15.300 --> 29:17.020]  I just bought one of those alarmos.
[29:17.200 --> 29:17.460]  I don't know.
[29:17.580 --> 29:20.280]  That feels like a thing that should be part of that, but it's not.
[29:21.040 --> 29:23.860]  All this really tells me is, is it the afternoon yet?
[29:24.760 --> 29:25.940]  It's like an afternoon clock.
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.540]  And it's so inconvenient.
[29:31.080 --> 29:33.600]  You have to go outside or is there like a...
[29:33.600 --> 29:34.460]  Do you have like a...
[29:34.460 --> 29:36.340]  You can view that from anywhere or?
[29:37.020 --> 29:38.560]  Yeah, I mean, I've got a camera on it.
[29:38.800 --> 29:39.100]  Okay.
[29:39.640 --> 29:40.820]  Well, it's not as inconvenient.
[29:41.940 --> 29:44.380]  There's something funny about like waking up and then
[29:44.380 --> 29:47.080]  going outside of your home to see what time it is.
[29:49.080 --> 29:50.560]  It's based on llama inflation.
[29:51.660 --> 29:54.580]  The worst type of inflation in this modern world.
[29:55.320 --> 29:56.500]  Llama inflation.
[29:57.140 --> 30:04.900]  When I go to my news feed, I sometimes just scroll just to see if headlines capture me.
[30:04.940 --> 30:07.000]  And how do you get to that news feed?
[30:07.320 --> 30:09.620]  Just I swipe left all the way on my phone.
[30:09.620 --> 30:09.940]  Okay.
[30:10.140 --> 30:11.140]  And then it's just a large thing.
[30:11.500 --> 30:17.060]  I got five health benefits of drinking carrot juice in the morning.
[30:17.500 --> 30:22.040]  How many benefits would it require before you started drinking carrot juice in the morning?
[30:22.740 --> 30:25.540]  Like, what's the least amount of benefits you could list in a story?
[30:25.960 --> 30:27.340]  Well, like, how many does it...
[30:27.340 --> 30:29.020]  Because five isn't doing it for me.
[30:29.300 --> 30:30.960]  I don't give a fuck about five.
[30:31.080 --> 30:32.280]  What are the five benefits?
[30:32.580 --> 30:33.520]  I have no clue.
[30:33.820 --> 30:34.680]  Five ain't enough.
[30:34.760 --> 30:36.500]  What if they're five brand new benefits?
[30:36.880 --> 30:37.900]  Yeah, but they might be...
[30:37.900 --> 30:38.440]  It's not...
[30:38.440 --> 30:40.440]  They could be weighted by how beneficial they are.
[30:40.600 --> 30:41.420]  Not for me.
[30:41.640 --> 30:42.380]  It could...
[30:42.380 --> 30:43.280]  It might only take one.
[30:43.400 --> 30:46.100]  If it's like a triple's dick length in two weeks,
[30:46.100 --> 30:47.720]  that's the only benefit I need.
[30:48.080 --> 30:49.100]  No, I don't want that.
[30:49.240 --> 30:49.640]  I need...
[30:49.640 --> 30:52.560]  I need double digits before I even consider it.
[30:52.820 --> 30:54.240]  So you want at least 10 benefits.
[30:54.420 --> 30:58.540]  They have to be 10 carrot drinking benefits for you to even consider drinking carrot juice?
[30:58.540 --> 31:02.840]  You want 10 minor carrot drinking benefits more than three major ones?
[31:03.160 --> 31:04.520]  Yeah, what if it was one major one?
[31:04.560 --> 31:05.760]  What if you could see in the dark?
[31:07.020 --> 31:08.540]  Okay, that's pretty cool.
[31:08.800 --> 31:13.500]  Okay, so if there's one benefit, then you would drink the carrot juice.
[31:13.580 --> 31:15.060]  No, I actually wouldn't want to see in the dark
[31:15.060 --> 31:17.220]  because sleeping would become just an annoyance.
[31:17.300 --> 31:17.900]  I would hate that.
[31:18.040 --> 31:18.900]  Close your eyes!
[31:18.960 --> 31:20.860]  The second benefit is...
[31:20.860 --> 31:25.800]  You wouldn't be in bed at night thinking, man, it's bright in here.
[31:26.040 --> 31:28.540]  My eyelids look boring.
[31:29.220 --> 31:31.060]  You can't even with night vision goggles.
[31:31.200 --> 31:33.160]  You can't see with your eyes closed.
[31:33.380 --> 31:35.480]  No, but night vision goggles are very bright.
[31:36.220 --> 31:41.640]  I'm somebody who likes to sit in bed and slowly wind down as I fall asleep with my eyes open.
[31:42.180 --> 31:43.680]  And then I fall asleep and I close my eyes.
[31:43.680 --> 31:45.560]  What is happening?
[31:46.300 --> 31:47.540]  What are you talking about?
[31:47.560 --> 31:48.480]  I phrased them incorrectly.
[31:48.740 --> 31:52.200]  You fall asleep by sitting in the dark with your eyes open?
[31:52.260 --> 31:56.720]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:56.900 --> 31:57.900]  I phrased that poorly.
[31:58.400 --> 32:02.900]  They close when they sleep, but I need some...
[32:02.900 --> 32:09.180]  I'm just sitting there enjoying the atmosphere of the cozy atmosphere.
[32:09.720 --> 32:11.020]  And then I'll close my eyes.
[32:11.420 --> 32:12.180]  With my eyes open.
[32:12.180 --> 32:13.860]  Then I'll close my eyes.
[32:13.940 --> 32:15.220]  Then I'll fall asleep.
[32:16.660 --> 32:17.620]  I've never...
[32:17.620 --> 32:21.260]  I've tried falling asleep with my eyes open just as a curiosity,
[32:21.380 --> 32:22.620]  and I have not been able to do it.
[32:25.940 --> 32:30.460]  So you wouldn't drink carrot juice if it let you see in the dark,
[32:30.560 --> 32:35.320]  because when you fall asleep, you have your eyes open until you close them?
[32:35.440 --> 32:39.680]  I think it would be the same experience as if you tried to sleep in a room with the lights on.
[32:39.680 --> 32:43.580]  What if the second benefit of drinking carrot juice
[32:43.580 --> 32:46.740]  is the ability to turn off night vision to go to bed?
[32:47.300 --> 32:48.460]  That's just normalized.
[32:48.580 --> 32:50.100]  At that point, you just have normal eyes.
[32:50.260 --> 32:52.080]  Yeah, but your first benefit is still night vision.
[32:53.320 --> 32:55.740]  You can just toggle it like a light switch.
[32:55.980 --> 32:56.980]  How am I toggling it?
[32:57.020 --> 32:57.560]  That's the second benefit.
[32:58.400 --> 32:59.900]  You blink three times.
[32:59.960 --> 33:00.800]  You blink three, yeah.
[33:01.020 --> 33:02.340]  I blink a lot.
[33:02.720 --> 33:04.600]  You would just control it like any part of your body.
[33:05.000 --> 33:05.240]  Yeah.
[33:05.400 --> 33:07.300]  It's like saying, how do I pick up my phone?
[33:07.300 --> 33:09.660]  Well, I first extend my arm.
[33:10.120 --> 33:12.280]  How do I breathe?
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.700]  You just do it, dude.
[33:14.200 --> 33:14.880]  No, that's not true.
[33:14.940 --> 33:16.200]  I think about breathing quite a bit.
[33:18.080 --> 33:19.340]  Because I hear...
[33:19.340 --> 33:20.760]  You should start drinking carrot juice, man.
[33:21.220 --> 33:24.880]  I hear that breathing from the gut is the way to...
[33:24.880 --> 33:25.720]  That's the optimal...
[33:25.720 --> 33:26.360]  How do you hear?
[33:26.460 --> 33:28.680]  Do you think about hearing before you hear or do you just hear?
[33:28.920 --> 33:30.780]  That's how you turn your night vision off.
[33:31.560 --> 33:32.040]  Okay.
[33:32.940 --> 33:35.000]  And it makes your poops better.
[33:35.540 --> 33:37.460]  And it's the third benefit.
[33:37.840 --> 33:43.000]  I think this might also be sort of slanted because I was traumatized by carrot juice
[33:43.000 --> 33:43.980]  as a child.
[33:45.480 --> 33:48.760]  I didn't know what I was getting into when I tried it the first time.
[33:48.840 --> 33:50.320]  I was not prepared for it.
[33:51.060 --> 33:54.740]  There was a neighborhood lemonade stand and they were selling a bunch of things.
[33:54.880 --> 33:59.140]  And one of the things they had was carrot juice because the person that lived there,
[33:59.200 --> 34:00.000]  they owned a restaurant.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.480]  Um, I'm assuming that's why they were selling carrot juice and they had access to it.
[34:06.820 --> 34:10.420]  And I saw orange drink and I thought orange drink.
[34:10.520 --> 34:11.360]  I like orange.
[34:11.580 --> 34:12.560]  That seems cool.
[34:12.780 --> 34:14.060]  That seems like a fun drink.
[34:14.280 --> 34:16.180]  And I went, I chugged it.
[34:16.320 --> 34:16.480]  All right.
[34:16.500 --> 34:18.500]  I took a big sip and it was just carrot.
[34:18.820 --> 34:20.140]  It was as advertised.
[34:20.620 --> 34:25.100]  So I wasn't mad at them, but it was jarring and not what I was expecting.
[34:25.320 --> 34:26.920]  And I have not forgotten that memory.
[34:27.540 --> 34:28.940]  So that put you off carrots for a while?
[34:28.940 --> 34:30.360]  No, I love carrots.
[34:30.580 --> 34:31.100]  Favorite vegetable.
[34:31.320 --> 34:32.660]  Just as a drinkable form.
[34:33.380 --> 34:33.560]  No.
[34:33.960 --> 34:36.600]  Is it because your mind was expecting a different taste?
[34:36.880 --> 34:39.100]  I was thinking it'd be kind of like sweet.
[34:40.620 --> 34:42.680]  You were thinking fruit, but it was veg.
[34:43.620 --> 34:44.100]  Exactly.
[34:44.540 --> 34:44.760]  Yeah.
[34:45.560 --> 34:48.300]  I think I was just creating it because I really like carrots.
[34:48.580 --> 34:50.200]  So I'm like, oh, I love carrots.
[34:50.560 --> 34:51.400]  This would be great.
[34:51.680 --> 34:53.700]  What's your favorite way to eat a carrot?
[34:54.080 --> 34:57.080]  Oh, I like a long roasted.
[34:58.240 --> 34:59.040]  You like roasted?
[34:59.140 --> 35:00.800]  So you prefer a cooked carrot over a raw carrot?
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.600]  Oh, a definite cooked with some rosemary on it.
[35:04.940 --> 35:06.220]  A little bit of olive oil.
[35:06.560 --> 35:08.620]  You just can't beat the crunch of a raw carrot.
[35:08.940 --> 35:11.020]  Oh, I just explained how you could beat it.
[35:11.440 --> 35:12.520]  It's like a crack.
[35:12.920 --> 35:13.220]  I don't know.
[35:13.240 --> 35:15.180]  I just cooked carrots on Monday and they were pretty good.
[35:15.220 --> 35:18.880]  You put a little bit of brown sugar on them so they get all caramelized and they're sweet.
[35:19.780 --> 35:22.940]  Do you think if you had like a high quality mic
[35:22.940 --> 35:26.600]  and you recorded the sound of somebody biting into a raw carrot,
[35:27.180 --> 35:32.880]  could you just differentiate that and home run swings like bat cracks?
[35:33.200 --> 35:35.900]  Oh, home runs versus fruits and vegetables.
[35:36.220 --> 35:38.060]  Yeah, home runs versus carrot bites.
[35:38.240 --> 35:39.880]  With the carrot, that'd be less cheering.
[35:40.560 --> 35:41.760]  Well, you could put the carrot.
[35:41.860 --> 35:42.280]  We could cheer.
[35:42.360 --> 35:43.100]  Could be an away game.
[35:47.720 --> 35:48.760]  The silence.
[35:49.280 --> 35:51.160]  Could have been Max Muncy last night.
[35:52.960 --> 35:58.460]  I wonder if you think if I cooked five carrots to different amounts of time
[35:59.020 --> 36:01.660]  and I just played you the cracks, do you think you could?
[36:01.860 --> 36:02.380]  Oh, definitely.
[36:02.840 --> 36:05.520]  Put them in order of rawness by ear.
[36:06.080 --> 36:06.420]  Easily.
[36:06.940 --> 36:08.940]  I've eaten so many fucking carrots in my life.
[36:09.000 --> 36:09.920]  I've been training for this.
[36:10.660 --> 36:11.800]  I know my carrots.
[36:13.740 --> 36:16.660]  This is actually like a burger level confidence thing for me.
[36:16.680 --> 36:20.480]  This is interesting for a guy who knows his carrots,
[36:20.480 --> 36:24.600]  who's been training for this his whole life, won't drink carrot juice for five benefits.
[36:25.060 --> 36:26.240]  No, because it's terrible.
[36:26.360 --> 36:27.140]  Tastes awful.
[36:27.700 --> 36:29.780]  You might just need to add something to it.
[36:29.780 --> 36:30.880]  Bit of ginger or something.
[36:31.360 --> 36:32.300]  I don't want it.
[36:32.320 --> 36:33.140]  I don't want ginger.
[36:33.900 --> 36:35.060]  Ginger is good for you, too.
[36:35.680 --> 36:36.440]  How many benefits?
[36:38.040 --> 36:39.540]  There's a lot of benefits of ginger.
[36:40.140 --> 36:41.760]  Did you actually read what the benefits were?
[36:41.960 --> 36:45.540]  No, I saw five and I said, that's not nearly enough.
[36:46.420 --> 36:49.260]  Then I screenshotted it and I thought everyone would agree.
[36:49.720 --> 36:52.800]  Okay, what if it just extended your life by two years?
[36:53.680 --> 36:54.040]  Hell yeah.
[36:54.200 --> 36:54.860]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[36:58.900 --> 37:00.300]  But it doesn't.
[37:00.440 --> 37:01.240]  It's not going to.
[37:01.580 --> 37:03.180]  Well, you don't know, you didn't read it.
[37:03.640 --> 37:04.300]  But it's not.
[37:04.580 --> 37:10.600]  Listen, if carrot juice could extend your life by two years, carrot juice would be the new Coke.
[37:11.220 --> 37:13.200]  Is it true that it turns you orange if you have too much?
[37:13.780 --> 37:15.240]  Oh, there's nine health benefits.
[37:15.620 --> 37:16.420]  Wow, nine.
[37:16.740 --> 37:17.480]  That's almost ten.
[37:17.480 --> 37:19.780]  We got to find ten health benefits of carrot juice.
[37:19.960 --> 37:22.200]  No, do not find because then I have to.
[37:22.540 --> 37:23.960]  I have to consider it.
[37:24.280 --> 37:25.060]  Ten is my baseline.
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.860]  While we're discussing the benefits of carrot juice, can I just mention I went to a birthday
[37:29.860 --> 37:33.180]  party over the weekend, a grown up birthday party for a grown up.
[37:33.520 --> 37:33.920]  Yeah.
[37:34.180 --> 37:37.760]  And they had a birthday cake and it was carrot cake.
[37:38.340 --> 37:43.760]  And that's such an odd choice to me for a grown up to choose for their own birthday.
[37:44.140 --> 37:44.340]  Really?
[37:44.380 --> 37:45.420]  I like carrot cake, too.
[37:45.500 --> 37:46.980]  I just don't ever associate it.
[37:46.980 --> 37:50.900]  I always I associate it with like kids with allergies at their birthday, but very rarely
[37:50.900 --> 37:58.440]  like do I associate it with like a grown up choosing that for their own cake on purpose.
[37:59.560 --> 38:01.000]  What is the vital?
[38:01.200 --> 38:02.400]  OK, here's the problem.
[38:02.940 --> 38:03.540]  Here's the problem.
[38:04.700 --> 38:07.080]  These are benefits of carrots, not carrot juice.
[38:07.240 --> 38:08.480]  I'm looking at this top ten.
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.420]  I eat carrots all day.
[38:10.860 --> 38:12.940]  It says benefits of carrot and its juice.
[38:13.280 --> 38:15.420]  What are the vital benefits of carrots?
[38:15.420 --> 38:20.440]  And then the one about the one the one above that that Nick sent is ten health benefits
[38:20.440 --> 38:21.300]  of carrot juice.
[38:21.700 --> 38:23.700]  So we've given you two different things.
[38:23.700 --> 38:26.960]  So that way, go get some carrots and drink them down, bud.
[38:27.160 --> 38:27.680]  OK, here we go.
[38:29.100 --> 38:29.980]  Eyesight, healthy.
[38:30.500 --> 38:32.360]  It increases your immune system.
[38:32.440 --> 38:33.420]  We could all use that.
[38:33.500 --> 38:34.620]  It prevents cancer.
[38:34.860 --> 38:35.980]  It's filled with antioxidants.
[38:36.640 --> 38:38.380]  It can help avoid sunburns.
[38:38.380 --> 38:39.600]  Big problem in Canada out here.
[38:39.920 --> 38:41.340]  It's good for your heart.
[38:41.960 --> 38:42.700]  You love your heart.
[38:43.180 --> 38:46.220]  I think potentially you should do carrot November.
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.540]  A lovely glass of carrot juice every morning.
[38:49.680 --> 38:51.860]  No, I'm not.
[38:54.740 --> 38:56.280]  Let's all do carrot November.
[38:56.700 --> 38:57.940]  We'll help Andrew out.
[38:58.160 --> 38:58.620]  I hate it.
[38:59.380 --> 39:00.540]  We're all going to do it together.
[39:00.780 --> 39:01.160]  Carrot juice.
[39:01.240 --> 39:01.720]  I don't give a shit.
[39:01.740 --> 39:02.560]  I like carrot juice.
[39:02.640 --> 39:03.420]  I got no problem with this.
[39:03.580 --> 39:03.760]  Yeah.
[39:03.880 --> 39:04.440]  What are we going to do?
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.720]  Drink carrot juice every day for the month of November.
[39:06.900 --> 39:07.300]  I'll do it.
[39:07.460 --> 39:07.660]  We'll see.
[39:07.740 --> 39:09.960]  We'll see if the podcast get better throughout the month.
[39:10.320 --> 39:11.020]  What about OK?
[39:11.020 --> 39:16.940]  How about one of the either next pod or the pod after I will try carrot juice and do a
[39:16.940 --> 39:17.520]  reevaluation.
[39:18.060 --> 39:19.340]  I'll go into it with an open mind.
[39:19.500 --> 39:20.120]  I like that.
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.040]  I still am into the idea of drinking carrot juice every day for a month and seeing what
[39:23.040 --> 39:23.280]  happens.
[39:23.520 --> 39:23.560]  I'm not.
[39:23.560 --> 39:24.380]  I'm not there yet.
[39:24.840 --> 39:26.920]  I need to baby step into this water.
[39:27.380 --> 39:29.120]  I turned to orange when I was a baby.
[39:29.420 --> 39:30.100]  That happened to me.
[39:30.780 --> 39:30.940]  Did you?
[39:31.040 --> 39:32.660]  That was that was some heavy drinking though, right?
[39:32.840 --> 39:33.160]  Yeah.
[39:33.160 --> 39:36.380]  When I was a baby, I got I got really sick from all the heavy drinking.
[39:36.500 --> 39:37.260]  No, I was eating.
[39:37.560 --> 39:39.220]  I ate like a lot, a lot of carrots or whatever.
[39:39.220 --> 39:41.600]  And I got orange ish.
[39:41.680 --> 39:42.320]  But it's reversible.
[39:42.740 --> 39:46.520]  Yeah, I mean, it's just it's just in your like skin and then your new skin comes and
[39:46.520 --> 39:46.840]  you're fine.
[39:47.020 --> 39:50.040]  It's in your skin and then you have new skin.
[39:50.180 --> 39:52.300]  You take off the old skin, you put on the new skin and it's fine.
[39:52.660 --> 39:53.960]  It's a tattoo from the inside.
[39:54.340 --> 39:56.160]  Yeah, yeah, but it's temporary.
[39:56.880 --> 40:02.320]  Well, with as much as Andrew already eats carrots, he's clearly built up an orange tolerance.
[40:02.440 --> 40:04.960]  So it won't be a concern for him if he drinks it every day for a month.
[40:05.020 --> 40:06.260]  I just can't wait for to carrot.
[40:06.360 --> 40:07.600]  November is going to rock.
[40:07.600 --> 40:09.660]  I'm excited about carrot November.
[40:10.480 --> 40:11.280]  Fuck, dude.
[40:11.600 --> 40:13.500]  And we're promoting health to the audience, too.
[40:13.600 --> 40:14.340]  Look at us.
[40:14.740 --> 40:16.380]  Look at us, Nick.
[40:16.860 --> 40:17.700]  Look at us.
[40:18.380 --> 40:18.820]  I don't know.
[40:18.820 --> 40:19.000]  Hang on.
[40:19.060 --> 40:22.600]  Let me Google carrot November and see if it takes me to a fuck store or whatever.
[40:22.740 --> 40:23.100]  Hang on.
[40:24.980 --> 40:27.540]  November plan of the month is carrots.
[40:28.320 --> 40:28.760]  Wow.
[40:29.260 --> 40:33.000]  The edible plant of the month for November is carrots.
[40:33.140 --> 40:33.840]  According to who?
[40:33.980 --> 40:34.860]  Oh my god.
[40:34.980 --> 40:36.720]  It was meant to be.
[40:36.720 --> 40:37.660]  According to who?
[40:38.680 --> 40:39.480]  Alachua County.
[40:39.820 --> 40:41.660]  Another one from Florida Times Union.
[40:41.960 --> 40:42.760]  This is exciting.
[40:44.480 --> 40:44.880]  Wow.
[40:45.700 --> 40:48.160]  I don't know why you can't commit to 30 days of carrot.
[40:48.600 --> 40:49.400]  I want to.
[40:49.560 --> 40:51.420]  Oh, I'll eat carrots for 30 days.
[40:51.520 --> 40:53.400]  It's the juice part that I don't know about.
[40:54.340 --> 40:55.500]  Does it have to be a morning?
[40:55.680 --> 40:57.740]  It's unfortunate because it's got to be the juice.
[40:58.200 --> 40:59.520]  No, you can drink it whenever.
[40:59.860 --> 41:01.020]  Yeah, why would it have to be the morning?
[41:01.100 --> 41:03.920]  Because the thing I said was for the morning specifics.
[41:04.040 --> 41:04.520]  I didn't know.
[41:04.520 --> 41:05.420]  Oh, that's true.
[41:05.760 --> 41:08.340]  No, I'd be okay with you drinking carrot juice at any point in the day.
[41:08.820 --> 41:09.520]  Yeah, I think it's fine.
[41:09.840 --> 41:11.600]  Dude, you mix a little apple in there.
[41:11.660 --> 41:12.680]  You got an apple carrot juice.
[41:12.760 --> 41:13.060]  Yum, yum.
[41:13.300 --> 41:16.760]  Nothing helps you get to sleep at night like a cold glass of carrot juice.
[41:16.860 --> 41:17.660]  That's what I always heard.
[41:17.740 --> 41:19.240]  You make that carrot juice.
[41:19.340 --> 41:21.920]  You sit there with your eyes open until they close and you go to bed.
[41:25.830 --> 41:28.890]  You know, you don't see my point of if you had night vision like that,
[41:28.910 --> 41:30.710]  it would just be like sleeping with the lights on.
[41:31.090 --> 41:35.210]  Yeah, but in your scenario, I can turn it off as easily as I've granted myself these
[41:35.210 --> 41:37.170]  superpowers, so I just solve the problem.
[41:37.610 --> 41:38.230]  That's fair.
[41:38.890 --> 41:43.070]  I saw another thing that that made me laugh quite a bit.
[41:45.230 --> 41:48.230]  Let me find... I had it queued up.
[41:48.590 --> 41:49.910]  When are we doing the kicker picker thing?
[41:49.970 --> 41:50.690]  That's in a week, right?
[41:50.750 --> 41:51.490]  Where we're re-picking?
[41:52.350 --> 41:54.650]  Oh, we haven't just lost this kicker.
[41:54.810 --> 41:56.410]  Yeah, kicker picker.
[41:56.650 --> 41:57.290]  Re-picker.
[41:57.890 --> 42:00.930]  Yeah, I thought I had it on the calendar.
[42:01.090 --> 42:04.770]  Kicker picker redraft is... we have it scheduled for the 28th.
[42:04.770 --> 42:07.330]  We can move it up if you need to, but the 28th is when I have it scheduled.
[42:07.350 --> 42:09.050]  I like the 28th.
[42:09.050 --> 42:09.770]  Why are we doing that?
[42:10.730 --> 42:14.170]  Because a bunch of kickers are hurt and we got to reshuffle the deck.
[42:14.230 --> 42:15.270]  You just lost a kicker.
[42:15.310 --> 42:16.650]  You seem very concerned by it.
[42:17.230 --> 42:20.230]  Huh, you can keep your existing kickers, right?
[42:20.270 --> 42:21.190]  You just pick new ones.
[42:21.290 --> 42:21.870]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[42:21.890 --> 42:22.410]  But no, no, no.
[42:22.450 --> 42:23.030]  Here's the thing.
[42:23.110 --> 42:24.950]  I don't think we have to redraw all of them.
[42:25.010 --> 42:26.790]  I think we have to do like a ranked order thing.
[42:26.870 --> 42:31.570]  Like whoever's in first can only like redraft one and then whoever's in second can redraft
[42:31.570 --> 42:34.190]  two, three, four, all the way to like the bottom.
[42:34.190 --> 42:38.810]  So that way you can like really sort of like, oh, no, my kicker isn't the regular kicker.
[42:39.550 --> 42:42.970]  And I think that'll help us sort of get the idea of what we're doing.
[42:43.250 --> 42:44.050]  What's the standings?
[42:44.610 --> 42:51.250]  I think it's Eric, Gavin, Jeff, Nick, Andrew, maybe?
[42:51.350 --> 42:53.350]  I was in the top three for quite a while.
[42:53.710 --> 42:58.010]  We're currently... here is the regulationfan.com kicker picker.
[42:58.450 --> 42:59.610]  And hey, go to that.
[42:59.670 --> 43:02.710]  But if you're looking for a sex story, you're not going to find it at regulationfan.com.
[43:02.710 --> 43:03.870]  Don't Google it.
[43:04.030 --> 43:05.210]  Just go to regulationfan.com.
[43:05.530 --> 43:10.270]  It is Eric in first at the time of this recording, which is the 17th of October.
[43:10.390 --> 43:12.150]  I'm in first with 275.
[43:12.250 --> 43:13.510]  Gavin is in second.
[43:13.590 --> 43:14.890]  Gavin, congratulations, dude.
[43:14.930 --> 43:15.390]  You're doing great.
[43:16.230 --> 43:16.730]  257.
[43:17.110 --> 43:18.530]  Jeff in third, 240.
[43:19.310 --> 43:21.370]  Andrew in fourth, 223.
[43:21.570 --> 43:24.150]  And Nick bringing up the rear, 180.
[43:24.930 --> 43:28.670]  And the reason for that is one of his kickers is released.
[43:31.290 --> 43:34.250]  So, yeah, Nick is going to need to do some rotating.
[43:34.450 --> 43:35.390]  Yep. Andrew's the same.
[43:35.490 --> 43:36.810]  He has one released kicker.
[43:37.310 --> 43:40.410]  And then it looks like we all have our kickers.
[43:40.510 --> 43:41.430]  So we should be good.
[43:41.510 --> 43:43.330]  But, you know, you can make a change.
[43:43.710 --> 43:44.970]  I love this site so much.
[43:45.470 --> 43:46.230]  Regulationfan.com.
[43:46.290 --> 43:48.010]  It has a kicker picker and movie auction.
[43:48.130 --> 43:50.510]  It's just like slowly filling out with the...
[43:52.550 --> 43:55.730]  Imagine someone stumbling onto this website and be like, oh, what are they tracking?
[43:56.150 --> 43:56.350]  Yep.
[43:57.310 --> 43:57.690]  It's great.
[43:58.230 --> 43:58.750]  Fantastic.
[43:59.070 --> 44:04.030]  There also is a make your own draft on the regulation fan site.
[44:04.170 --> 44:06.950]  It's not the one that we typically use for our draft generator.
[44:07.090 --> 44:10.950]  That's the one that Sean Bear made over at regulationdrafts.github.io.
[44:11.390 --> 44:12.810]  But just a heads up.
[44:13.290 --> 44:14.630]  Which is also not a sex site.
[44:15.190 --> 44:15.430]  Yeah.
[44:16.310 --> 44:18.050]  Google as much as you need.
[44:18.110 --> 44:22.610]  Speaking of a summer movie league and stuff relating to it,
[44:22.950 --> 44:27.190]  there's a story I saw that I can't stop laughing about.
[44:27.690 --> 44:30.750]  Of a quote from Zachary Levi.
[44:31.950 --> 44:36.690]  Shazam stars Zachary Levi endorses Trump and move he calls career suicide.
[44:36.990 --> 44:41.010]  The herald in the purple crayon guy is like, listen,
[44:42.030 --> 44:46.050]  I'm this is I'm making this is a dangerous move for me.
[44:46.150 --> 44:49.110]  Like his career couldn't be in a worse spot.
[44:49.470 --> 44:53.750]  And the fact that they reference Shazam, which I believe is one of the,
[44:53.750 --> 44:57.770]  if not the biggest Warner Brothers superhero bomb Shazam 2.
[44:58.570 --> 45:04.290]  The notion of your career being below zero and and making any statement of this is
[45:04.290 --> 45:06.050]  this is going to be a real problem for my career.
[45:06.770 --> 45:08.190]  Nobody's seeing your movies.
[45:08.710 --> 45:12.910]  Do you think if Shazam 2 didn't lose as much money, Rooster Teeth would still be around?
[45:13.270 --> 45:14.670]  That's a great question.
[45:15.170 --> 45:15.970]  What do you think?
[45:16.010 --> 45:20.670]  Like where like where what domino could have not fallen or like just fall back
[45:20.670 --> 45:22.710]  slightly to the right and we'd still have jobs?
[45:22.710 --> 45:23.770]  How about this?
[45:24.010 --> 45:26.230]  Do you think if Rooster Teeth had done better,
[45:26.470 --> 45:28.710]  maybe Joker 2 would have had more money in it?
[45:30.070 --> 45:30.250]  Yeah.
[45:30.350 --> 45:33.810]  Like maybe we took down Joker 2 because Shazam took us down.
[45:33.870 --> 45:33.990]  Yep.
[45:34.150 --> 45:37.530]  And that's why I'm declaring that we're remaking Rooster Teeth.
[45:37.690 --> 45:39.730]  Meanwhile, Batgirls over here go, what about me?
[45:40.110 --> 45:40.870]  What about me?
[45:41.010 --> 45:42.510]  I want the Wile E. Coyote movie.
[45:42.590 --> 45:44.850]  Yeah, John Cena and Wile E. Coyote.
[45:44.990 --> 45:45.810]  Those are my heroes.
[45:46.990 --> 45:49.310]  The tag team we've all been waiting for.
[45:49.590 --> 45:50.070]  They should be.
[45:50.130 --> 45:51.650]  They should be the tag champions at WrestleMania.
[45:51.650 --> 45:53.490]  John Cena and Wile E. Coyote.
[45:53.630 --> 45:55.770]  They need to put Wile E. Coyote in the wrestling games.
[45:56.270 --> 46:00.270]  How does a coyote interact with a real Roadrunner?
[46:00.790 --> 46:01.610]  What do you mean?
[46:01.910 --> 46:03.590]  If you just put them together, what would they do?
[46:04.470 --> 46:05.710]  That's a great question.
[46:05.730 --> 46:08.030]  I mean, a coyote would probably try to eat the Roadrunner.
[46:08.230 --> 46:10.350]  That's what coyotes do.
[46:10.650 --> 46:11.010]  Okay, here.
[46:11.290 --> 46:12.150]  I googled...
[46:12.150 --> 46:12.410]  Uh oh.
[46:16.250 --> 46:16.990]  Oh no!
[46:18.610 --> 46:20.410]  Oh, oh, that's what happened.
[46:20.850 --> 46:21.210]  Yeah.
[46:22.870 --> 46:25.190]  I'm glad you got there before I could finish my Google search.
[46:26.490 --> 46:27.210]  That's depressing.
[46:27.590 --> 46:29.670]  I'm learning a Roadrunner is very, very small.
[46:30.170 --> 46:32.090]  Oh, we have Roadrunners in Austin.
[46:32.250 --> 46:32.930]  Have you never seen them?
[46:33.210 --> 46:33.790]  Show me one.
[46:34.170 --> 46:35.090]  Well, I mean, maybe I've seen one.
[46:35.190 --> 46:36.090]  I didn't know what it was.
[46:36.610 --> 46:37.350]  They're pretty fast.
[46:37.930 --> 46:38.970]  Sometimes you'll hear them.
[46:39.270 --> 46:41.130]  You'll hear a meep meep, and then you'll look over.
[46:41.230 --> 46:43.290]  But all you can really see is just a cloud of dust.
[46:43.950 --> 46:44.590]  There's dust.
[46:44.850 --> 46:47.190]  You ever see dust in the shape of that bird?
[46:47.350 --> 46:48.210]  That's what it is.
[46:48.210 --> 46:51.110]  How the fuck is that bird painting?
[46:51.730 --> 46:53.030]  I'm calling bullshit.
[46:54.910 --> 46:56.290]  That's such a cute bird.
[46:56.370 --> 46:56.910]  I love that.
[46:57.070 --> 46:57.630]  Oh, yeah.
[46:58.890 --> 46:59.870]  Roadrunners are small.
[47:00.010 --> 47:02.050]  Like, they're not... they're not big.
[47:02.190 --> 47:05.150]  They're just like little birds that they just kind of go...
[47:05.150 --> 47:05.670]  They skitter.
[47:05.830 --> 47:06.710]  Like, they run fast.
[47:06.790 --> 47:07.230]  That's all they do.
[47:07.370 --> 47:10.510]  We should draft animals that are cooler in cartoons.
[47:10.850 --> 47:12.570]  Like, have you seen a real Wolverine?
[47:12.910 --> 47:13.470]  Oh, yeah.
[47:13.990 --> 47:15.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[47:15.250 --> 47:15.590]  Tiny.
[47:16.190 --> 47:17.250]  Yeah, it's...
[47:17.250 --> 47:19.750]  Like, they... I think they look kind of cool.
[47:19.890 --> 47:24.130]  But then when you tell me that it's a Wolverine and it's, you know, Wolverine, that's not that cool.
[47:25.770 --> 47:30.650]  Here, if you had to make a choice, which Wolverine is for you?
[47:34.730 --> 47:36.470]  Furry guy or...
[47:36.470 --> 47:37.170]  Poppin' Claws.
[47:37.590 --> 47:38.910]  Yeah, Poppin' Claws, baby.
[47:39.350 --> 47:42.190]  So they didn't name the Roadrunner until roads were invented?
[47:43.030 --> 47:43.950]  Like, Pokemon?
[47:43.950 --> 47:47.870]  But, like, what do you mean roads were invented?
[47:48.030 --> 47:50.970]  Do you mean, like, pavement?
[47:51.690 --> 47:53.030]  No, like a Roman road.
[47:53.730 --> 47:54.790]  When were roads invented?
[47:55.530 --> 47:56.230]  Hang on.
[47:57.010 --> 47:59.650]  When were roads invented first?
[48:00.110 --> 48:01.930]  Romans did straight roads, didn't they?
[48:01.990 --> 48:03.190]  They loved a good long road.
[48:03.310 --> 48:06.570]  The earliest record of constructed roads date back to 4000 BCE.
[48:07.310 --> 48:10.950]  So, yeah, yeah, definitely old.
[48:11.290 --> 48:13.210]  And I would think that a Roadrunner probably...
[48:13.210 --> 48:14.750]  When was a Roadrunner discovered?
[48:14.910 --> 48:17.270]  When were Roadrunners discovered?
[48:17.730 --> 48:18.710]  That's a better search.
[48:18.830 --> 48:22.430]  I was just googling Roadrunner name and I just kept getting Looney Tunes.
[48:25.030 --> 48:28.990]  It was named the official bird of New Mexico in 1949.
[48:29.510 --> 48:31.650]  Wait, the Roadrunner's name is Beep Beep?
[48:32.070 --> 48:33.170]  His name is Beep Beep?
[48:33.810 --> 48:34.210]  Apparently.
[48:34.870 --> 48:35.190]  What?
[48:35.850 --> 48:37.690]  Beep Beep the Roadrunner is his full name.
[48:38.170 --> 48:38.450]  What?
[48:38.810 --> 48:39.790]  That doesn't sound right.
[48:40.250 --> 48:42.210]  That's what Google's telling me.
[48:42.770 --> 48:45.110]  Found someone on Reddit.
[48:45.530 --> 48:48.870]  What were Roadrunners called before there were roads?
[48:51.230 --> 48:53.990]  They're common throughout the Southwest.
[48:54.830 --> 48:58.230]  And there are native languages that had some names.
[48:58.610 --> 48:59.830]  But a lot of them...
[48:59.830 --> 49:02.250]  Snake Eater was one of the...
[49:02.250 --> 49:03.130]  I'll have to mail you a name.
[49:03.890 --> 49:09.570]  The scientific name is Geococcyx californianus.
[49:09.990 --> 49:10.290]  Whoa.
[49:10.970 --> 49:13.090]  I hear that happens if you drink carrot juice.
[49:13.450 --> 49:13.890]  Californianus.
[49:15.690 --> 49:17.110]  It ends in anus.
[49:17.510 --> 49:18.270]  It's very sexual.
[49:18.990 --> 49:19.590]  Wow, that is nice.
[49:20.250 --> 49:20.510]  Yeah.
[49:22.650 --> 49:26.110]  I don't think that's true because I looked up the coyotes also,
[49:26.350 --> 49:27.530]  and that's not what I found.
[49:28.530 --> 49:30.130]  Carnivorous vulgaris is a coyote,
[49:30.370 --> 49:33.090]  and Accelerati incredibullus is a Roadrunner.
[49:35.350 --> 49:37.270]  So I'm not sure what your source is,
[49:37.330 --> 49:38.750]  but mine's in black and white right there, bud.
[49:40.530 --> 49:42.450]  Dream of californianus.
[49:47.650 --> 49:51.570]  Una silla de masajes puede parecer extravagante.
[49:51.950 --> 49:53.370]  Ocho configuraciones diferentes.
[49:53.610 --> 49:54.570]  Intensidad ajustable.
[49:54.870 --> 49:56.070]  Además, es calefaccionado.
[49:56.490 --> 49:58.770]  Y se siente tan bien.
[49:59.470 --> 50:02.090]  Sí, una silla de masajes puede parecer extravagante.
[50:02.290 --> 50:03.750]  Y dos, bueno, aún más.
[50:04.130 --> 50:06.390]  Pero cuando esas sillas de masajes vienen con un auto,
[50:07.770 --> 50:09.890]  se vuelven bastante prácticas.
[50:10.290 --> 50:13.470]  El nuevo Volkswagen Teguan 2025, con funciones premium,
[50:13.610 --> 50:16.050]  como los asientos delanteros con masaje disponibles,
[50:16.190 --> 50:17.670]  solo parece extravagante.

[50:44.930 --> 50:47.170]  Have you guys ever searched something
[50:47.170 --> 50:51.630]  and received the most opposite thing for what you're looking for?
[50:52.090 --> 50:55.470]  Like, what are there any distinct memories of like you put in a search?
[50:55.690 --> 50:57.550]  For me, it was like I was looking for a movie.
[50:57.690 --> 50:59.210]  I didn't know if a platform had it.
[50:59.550 --> 51:04.370]  So I searched it and it gave me literally the furthest thing from the movie I requested.
[51:04.870 --> 51:06.970]  Did you Google James Bond and you got an ornithologist?
[51:07.370 --> 51:09.010]  I did. Yeah, I got a bird guy.
[51:09.790 --> 51:10.950]  I've been on.
[51:11.790 --> 51:13.150]  Flubbed a whole syllable there, I think.
[51:15.970 --> 51:18.150]  I've been on a real Stallone kick.
[51:18.350 --> 51:24.490]  So I was trying to watch some Rambo and I didn't know if this service would have it.
[51:24.790 --> 51:26.450]  So I put Rambo in and I searched it.
[51:26.710 --> 51:29.650]  And the only thing it brought me back was Ramona and Beezus,
[51:30.130 --> 51:33.810]  which is not at all what I'm looking for.
[51:33.930 --> 51:36.350]  I don't really feel outside of the R.A.M.
[51:37.190 --> 51:38.710]  I mean, that has to be it.
[51:38.710 --> 51:39.970]  Just tonally.
[51:40.550 --> 51:43.190]  I can't imagine anyone searching Rambo and then just going,
[51:43.290 --> 51:45.130]  Oh, Ramona Beezus, sure, I'll watch that instead.
[51:45.430 --> 51:46.030]  Let's do that.
[51:48.550 --> 51:49.630]  Did you watch any of it?
[51:50.010 --> 51:52.230]  No, I just I was shocked.
[51:52.310 --> 51:54.730]  I was like, this is not at all the feel I'm going for.
[51:55.530 --> 51:56.050]  So be on the lookout.
[51:56.230 --> 51:59.030]  I'd love to see if you guys ever encounter something like that.
[51:59.590 --> 52:00.010]  Oh, I did.
[52:00.150 --> 52:00.730]  I can't remember.
[52:01.130 --> 52:04.530]  I can't remember what I was searching, but I got a result that I was not expecting.
[52:06.330 --> 52:06.690]  Paste.
[52:07.590 --> 52:14.030]  We should do a game where we open up IMDb and we come up with a word and then we type
[52:14.030 --> 52:17.710]  that word into IMDb and then we have to watch one of the movies that's returned featuring
[52:17.710 --> 52:18.210]  that word.
[52:18.750 --> 52:21.430]  Oh, I whatever Gavin just posted.
[52:21.570 --> 52:22.630]  What's going on?
[52:22.790 --> 52:27.230]  I was searching something and the only thing that came up was a film called Slap Her, She's
[52:27.230 --> 52:31.050]  French, which I then couldn't find anything about online.
[52:31.150 --> 52:32.350]  Have we talked about that?
[52:32.690 --> 52:33.890]  I think we have.
[52:34.290 --> 52:34.630]  Potentially.
[52:35.470 --> 52:36.390]  From you.
[52:36.390 --> 52:41.250]  Yeah, we've definitely done it before, because when I just Googled it, I've clicked on the
[52:41.250 --> 52:43.810]  Wikipedia for it and it had to be from this.
[52:43.990 --> 52:44.890]  It was from the show.
[52:44.950 --> 52:45.630]  It sounded familiar.
[52:45.850 --> 52:46.050]  Weird.
[52:46.630 --> 52:47.070]  Yeah, I don't know.
[52:47.250 --> 52:48.290]  I can't remember what I was searching there.
[52:48.550 --> 52:51.130]  Nick just posted Angus, thongs and perfect snot.
[52:51.210 --> 52:51.870]  What is this?
[52:52.330 --> 52:52.910]  No idea.
[52:53.110 --> 52:56.810]  I was just flipping through movies and this popped up and I thought that was quite British
[52:56.810 --> 52:58.270]  and that Gavin might be able to explain it.
[52:58.270 --> 52:59.130]  Sounds pretty British.
[53:01.070 --> 53:01.470]  Snogging?
[53:01.750 --> 53:03.570]  What's Angus in the UK?
[53:04.270 --> 53:04.550]  Yeah.
[53:05.130 --> 53:05.390]  Cow.
[53:05.950 --> 53:09.410]  So cow, underwear and perfect kisses.
[53:10.570 --> 53:12.190]  Andrew, you know what snogging is?
[53:12.770 --> 53:15.110]  What's snogging for 400 plates?
[53:18.130 --> 53:18.270]  What?
[53:18.430 --> 53:18.870]  Make it out.
[53:19.310 --> 53:20.030]  Oh, it's making it.
[53:20.270 --> 53:20.930]  Oh, yeah, it's kissing.
[53:21.650 --> 53:24.130]  That's a dirtier name than the act.
[53:25.230 --> 53:26.810]  I don't think those equal correctly.
[53:28.010 --> 53:28.270]  Yeah.
[53:29.270 --> 53:32.090]  Snogging sounds filthier than just making out.
[53:32.090 --> 53:36.930]  Uh, snogging sounds like a thing they would sell at the regulation shop if you just Google
[53:36.930 --> 53:37.830]  regulation shop.
[53:38.470 --> 53:40.090]  Like a five pack of snogging.
[53:40.330 --> 53:41.530]  A five pack of snog.
[53:41.610 --> 53:41.850]  Yeah.
[53:43.390 --> 53:44.110]  Snogging ring.
[53:47.490 --> 53:48.530]  This would not be.
[53:48.670 --> 53:49.090]  I don't know.
[53:49.270 --> 53:50.630]  There's something dirty about it.
[53:51.310 --> 53:51.910]  It's very odd.
[53:52.490 --> 53:53.290]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[53:53.370 --> 53:55.930]  Hey, can I can I shift gears a little bit and ask a question?
[53:56.270 --> 53:59.330]  The new Mario Party came out.
[53:59.410 --> 54:00.770]  Is that something we're interested in?
[54:00.790 --> 54:01.790]  Is that something we're going to do?
[54:01.790 --> 54:04.350]  It feels like a lot of people want to do that today.
[54:05.490 --> 54:07.330]  Um, no, we have to we have to watch.
[54:07.470 --> 54:11.750]  We have to watch Nick play last of us and learn that he can save.
[54:11.870 --> 54:14.590]  But he knows he can save at any point in time.
[54:14.670 --> 54:15.310]  Uh-huh.
[54:15.470 --> 54:17.430]  Um, so we got to do it later, I guess.
[54:17.550 --> 54:20.170]  I don't know anything about the new Mario Party.
[54:20.230 --> 54:21.470]  Is it supposed to be good?
[54:21.890 --> 54:22.270]  No idea.
[54:22.350 --> 54:22.730]  Let's play it.
[54:22.750 --> 54:23.450]  People seem to like it.
[54:23.530 --> 54:24.150]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[54:24.490 --> 54:24.690]  OK.
[54:25.530 --> 54:26.310]  I mean, you can't.
[54:26.330 --> 54:27.930]  I mean, is it are there five players?
[54:28.010 --> 54:28.750]  It does have to be four.
[54:28.890 --> 54:29.310]  Do I have to say?
[54:29.310 --> 54:30.330]  It has to be four.
[54:30.590 --> 54:33.090]  Oh, you guys can play it while I'm not here tomorrow.
[54:33.170 --> 54:34.130]  We're heisting tomorrow.
[54:34.210 --> 54:35.230]  Yeah, we're heisting tomorrow.
[54:35.330 --> 54:37.010]  If you're not here, we have to play Grand Theft Auto.
[54:37.370 --> 54:39.890]  And we could also just play more Grand Theft Auto if you want to.
[54:40.510 --> 54:41.510]  Eric has a problem.
[54:42.570 --> 54:45.170]  My problem is that we're not playing Grand Theft Auto.
[54:46.910 --> 54:48.690]  You're the president of the company, right?
[54:48.810 --> 54:49.390]  Yeah, uh-huh.
[54:49.650 --> 54:51.510]  All you want us to do is play GTA.
[54:52.010 --> 54:53.510]  Yeah, we're playing other games, though.
[54:53.570 --> 54:54.470]  Like we're getting stuff done.
[54:54.530 --> 54:55.390]  We're recording the podcast.
[54:55.690 --> 54:56.690]  He's going to do last of us.
[54:56.750 --> 54:57.630]  We played Predator, whatever.
[54:57.630 --> 54:59.390]  We didn't play any Grand Theft Auto today.
[54:59.390 --> 55:01.950]  The problem with Grand Theft Auto is we need an agenda.
[55:02.130 --> 55:03.730]  There's got to be a reason to play it.
[55:03.850 --> 55:07.930]  Yeah, we get in there and then Gavin remembers something from 13 years ago
[55:07.930 --> 55:09.010]  and we just play that.
[55:09.190 --> 55:09.670]  It's great.
[55:10.710 --> 55:12.470]  It's worked for us so far.
[55:12.750 --> 55:15.990]  That there's a very limited palette of those moments, I believe.
[55:16.750 --> 55:17.190]  Unfortunately.
[55:17.570 --> 55:18.570]  We still haven't seen it.
[55:18.790 --> 55:20.790]  Some of us stayed two and a half hours later to see
[55:21.330 --> 55:23.010]  and I think saw it eventually.
[55:23.390 --> 55:25.290]  I am still missing a goddamn ****.
[55:25.930 --> 55:27.790]  See, I feel so bad for you, Jeff.
[55:27.850 --> 55:30.590]  You didn't get to see the **** or whatever you're talking about, dude.
[55:32.810 --> 55:33.290]  Spoiler.
[55:34.030 --> 55:34.930]  Big spoiler.
[55:35.570 --> 55:36.550]  I'll just bleep it all.
[55:36.970 --> 55:37.970]  Didn't see the bleep.
[55:38.670 --> 55:40.610]  Didn't see that spooky bleep.
[55:42.910 --> 55:45.630]  I didn't collect one of the 10 bleeps.
[55:50.250 --> 55:54.570]  Now I can't use the special bleep suit or the special bleep car.
[55:57.550 --> 56:02.150]  I was walking around with Meg last week and we inadvertently just shat on Eric
[56:02.150 --> 56:03.330]  without intending to.
[56:03.350 --> 56:04.050]  What the ****?
[56:04.210 --> 56:05.550]  What did I do?
[56:05.770 --> 56:11.050]  There was a guy at a store who had like white hair and he kind of looked like Eric.
[56:12.210 --> 56:15.130]  And then Meg was like, oh, look, it's Eric in 40 years.
[56:15.370 --> 56:17.330]  And I looked at this guy and he must have been like,
[56:17.930 --> 56:19.410]  he must have been like 50.
[56:19.570 --> 56:20.910]  I was like, it's Eric in 10 years.
[56:21.870 --> 56:23.410]  It's a lot.
[56:23.590 --> 56:27.170]  That's so nice of her to say Eric in 40 years.
[56:27.310 --> 56:28.110]  That's so kind.
[56:28.270 --> 56:29.790]  The gray doesn't stop.
[56:29.850 --> 56:31.690]  It keeps going, does not go backwards.
[56:32.270 --> 56:33.270]  I got so much gray.
[56:33.710 --> 56:37.090]  I think it's less a function of time and more a function of podcasts.
[56:37.170 --> 56:42.210]  So I would say I would refer to it as more as how many Eric in 50 podcasts.
[56:43.870 --> 56:47.330]  So a year, a year and 10 weeks.
[56:47.890 --> 56:49.670]  I don't know if it's in a recording.
[56:49.670 --> 56:51.050]  We're playing like a 360 thing.
[56:51.170 --> 56:54.870]  And I looked, I looked at my recent players on the 360 dashboard,
[56:55.010 --> 56:57.810]  because it's a separate dashboard to the modern day Xbox.
[56:58.570 --> 57:01.230]  And it was a bunch of GTA 5 and a bunch of game attacks.
[57:01.550 --> 57:03.630]  And it was like last seen.
[57:03.730 --> 57:04.950]  Oh, it's because we're playing Grawl.
[57:04.990 --> 57:07.330]  And it said last seen 365 days ago.
[57:07.410 --> 57:08.930]  I was like, oh, wow, it's like exactly a year.
[57:09.210 --> 57:11.350]  And then I noticed there was another five after it.
[57:11.930 --> 57:14.390]  It was 10 years since I'd seen.
[57:14.570 --> 57:15.890]  Oh my God.
[57:16.250 --> 57:16.650]  Wow.
[57:19.770 --> 57:23.530]  I can you guys want me to age Eric, I think a few years in a podcast.
[57:23.930 --> 57:24.370]  Yeah.
[57:25.970 --> 57:30.290]  No, I enough time has passed that I feel comfortable confessing this now.
[57:30.310 --> 57:31.970]  Oh, God, not in the moment.
[57:32.130 --> 57:36.750]  We had we had an issue that I realized, oh, boy, I could have really helped.
[57:36.890 --> 57:37.770]  And I did not.
[57:39.910 --> 57:44.610]  Remember when we tried to play Predator like weeks ago for the first time?
[57:44.730 --> 57:45.290]  Uh huh.
[57:45.330 --> 57:47.090]  And your setup was not working.
[57:47.490 --> 57:47.710]  Yeah.
[57:47.710 --> 57:49.890]  And so people were in.
[57:50.250 --> 57:52.890]  You're sharing your feed to see like your setup.
[57:53.130 --> 57:56.870]  And and the guys, everyone was like, oh, man, we could hear everything coming back.
[57:56.970 --> 57:57.110]  Yeah.
[57:58.170 --> 58:02.350]  I was I was part of that, but I was not in your stream and I was playing.
[58:02.470 --> 58:06.530]  I just loaded up a different game and I was playing it and they were going like, oh,
[58:06.530 --> 58:07.390]  I still hear it.
[58:07.450 --> 58:08.650]  And I just went, no, I can't.
[58:08.670 --> 58:09.130]  That's weird.
[58:10.070 --> 58:11.450]  I wasn't in the stream.
[58:13.430 --> 58:14.230]  Oh, Andre.
[58:14.590 --> 58:17.510]  I was like, I don't know if there's something weird with my audio.
[58:17.710 --> 58:18.790]  There wasn't enough time.
[58:18.990 --> 58:20.730]  Enough time hasn't passed.
[58:20.910 --> 58:21.470]  I agree.
[58:21.850 --> 58:24.870]  We haven't even explained this fully yet.
[58:25.050 --> 58:26.050]  We're so stupid.
[58:26.370 --> 58:27.750]  I want you kicked out of the company.
[58:27.970 --> 58:29.230]  We've we've talked around.
[58:30.030 --> 58:34.850]  We've talked around it, but it is definitely one of the dumbest things I've participated
[58:34.850 --> 58:39.210]  in professionally in my entire career, and not in a good way.
[58:39.690 --> 58:40.810]  I got a Rodecaster Duo.
[58:41.150 --> 58:42.970]  It is a new audio deck.
[58:42.970 --> 58:46.470]  So that way we can I can get better audio for the podcast and our recordings.
[58:46.470 --> 58:51.270]  When we set it up, I thought I had it routed the right way to hear everything.
[58:51.490 --> 58:52.170]  I did not.
[58:52.470 --> 58:56.610]  So we came in and we're like, oh, we will reroute this stuff.
[58:57.010 --> 58:58.470]  Oh, man, we're hearing all this.
[58:58.550 --> 58:59.250]  We're hearing all that.
[58:59.430 --> 59:01.250]  Your audacity was recording everything, right?
[59:01.390 --> 59:01.790]  Correct.
[59:01.910 --> 59:02.190]  Correct.
[59:02.430 --> 59:06.530]  And then we all got like, oh, well, I'll share my screen on Discord and then we can poke
[59:06.530 --> 59:08.810]  around and see what it is and what we need to do, whatever.
[59:09.520 --> 59:17.050]  We did that for forty nine minutes before realizing, oh, we can hear everything because
[59:17.050 --> 59:17.490]  we're watching.
[59:17.570 --> 59:23.210]  It was Nick like playing a game or something that was like, oh, yeah, we can hear this
[59:23.210 --> 59:25.150]  because, you know, watching the stream.
[59:26.470 --> 59:31.050]  Oh, we were basically trying to make it so that audacity wasn't recording the Discord
[59:31.050 --> 59:33.490]  and the system sounds and everything else.
[59:33.730 --> 59:38.310]  And we were disabling things one by one to the point where almost everything was muted.
[59:38.810 --> 59:44.290]  We could still hear us right through your thing.
[59:44.450 --> 59:48.950]  And yeah, it was just because we were listening to your computer and it wasn't coming through
[59:48.950 --> 59:51.050]  Discord through you as someone on Discord.
[59:51.450 --> 59:53.430]  Most of us were listening to my computer.
[59:53.650 --> 59:54.910]  Well, that was happening.
[59:55.150 --> 59:56.350]  Fucking off.
[59:56.550 --> 01:00:01.610]  No, I was I was testing to see if there is a game that'd be fun for us to play as a let's
[01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:01.930]  play.
[01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:03.970]  And I was trying to figure that out.
[01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.770]  And I was like, I'm not going to be able to help whatever this is.
[01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:07.610]  I don't need to be doing this.
[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:10.010]  Let me look at this game to see if this would be fun for us to play.
[01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:11.810]  Then why were you giving input?
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.030]  I wasn't.
[01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:13.830]  He really wasn't.
[01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:15.010]  He was pretty checked out.
[01:00:15.150 --> 01:00:20.370]  I was, yeah, I was just I was quietly trying to figure out the tutorial for this game.
[01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:21.690]  I wasn't checked out.
[01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.470]  I just knew I couldn't help whatever was going on.
[01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:29.590]  It was immediately apparent that Andrew was going to provide no assistance in that situation.
[01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:30.610]  And so he did.
[01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.770]  He provided assistance in the best way possible by staying out of the way.
[01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:39.750]  It's just that he inadvertently stumbled upon a really important piece of information that
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:43.790]  could have helped accelerate our path to discovering our own stupidity.
[01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:52.810]  I think the thing that we're not accurately conveying is just how genuinely depressing
[01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:57.730]  and embarrassing it was when we discovered our own folly.
[01:00:58.110 --> 01:01:02.310]  You know, it was like I felt really honestly bad about myself for a while.
[01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:06.690]  Well, because the more people there are, the more you expect someone to figure it out.
[01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:07.270]  Exactly.
[01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:07.970]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.270]  It was like when we were in those boats in Minecraft,
[01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.210]  Jeff, and we were following the compass north instead of
[01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:16.770]  remembering that it was taking us to our spawn.
[01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:22.530]  I was playing the game special delivery,
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:25.710]  trying to learn how to deliver packages to see if we could do this as a group.
[01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:26.510]  And it would be fun.
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:28.910]  And every once in a while, you guys would be like,
[01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:29.770]  I heard that.
[01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:31.190]  I'd go, I didn't hear nothing.
[01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:31.710]  That's weird.
[01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.390]  Whatever.
[01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.730]  I just kept going.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.650]  I just kept continuing with my life.
[01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:36.870]  That reminds me.
[01:01:36.930 --> 01:01:38.130]  We got to play that cemetery game.
[01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:38.950]  We do.
[01:01:39.110 --> 01:01:40.210]  Yeah, that came out.
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:40.790]  I have to.
[01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.970]  I'll probably install that right after this.
[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:44.530]  Is everyone in town next week?
[01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.290]  Yeah.
[01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:45.770]  Yeah.
[01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:46.850]  All week.
[01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:48.850]  Wait, hang on.
[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:49.310]  Nick said.
[01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:51.030]  I think so.
[01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:51.590]  What?
[01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:53.450]  How do you not?
[01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:54.290]  You have a kid.
[01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.450]  You have to know ahead of time if you're in town or not.
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.030]  What do you?
[01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.130]  I think so.
[01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:00.410]  What's next week?
[01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:00.850]  Oh yeah.
[01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:01.310]  I'm in town.
[01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:02.710]  Oh my God.
[01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:03.150]  What?
[01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:06.250]  I don't understand how this company functions this way.
[01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.670]  Like.
[01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:07.670]  What are you talking about?
[01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:09.230]  It's two years and I'm gone.
[01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:11.390]  Your answer sucked.
[01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.130]  And there we go.
[01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:16.530]  That's two years, baby.
[01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:19.070]  We just added two years right there.
[01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.550]  Good work, team.
[01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.510]  We went to Jack in the Box to order this food.
[01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.510]  And I asked the guys if they wanted anything else.
[01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:26.770]  And Nick just started going, jalapeños.
[01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.990]  And it was like, they don't they don't just have jalapeños.
[01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:35.470]  And he just kept saying he just kept saying jalapeños.
[01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:38.390]  And what he meant was jalapeño poppers.
[01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.370]  What that doesn't answer is what size or what?
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:44.890]  Like he just kept saying a single word.
[01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:48.310]  If somebody sounds like it sounds like a real blue raspberry type situation.
[01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.770]  I'm on Nick's side here.
[01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.890]  Sort of.
[01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:51.690]  I'm sort of on Nick's side.
[01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.370]  He should be saying poppers, not jalapeños.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:54.010]  I agree.
[01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.870]  Somebody just says items.
[01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:56.910]  Just get the fucking large.
[01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:57.610]  No.
[01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:58.110]  Okay.
[01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.230]  I'm not on Nick's side at all.
[01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:00.370]  You're assuming a medium.
[01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:00.910]  There's so much.
[01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:07.390]  Nick gave the least amount of information that everyone is supposed to just assume the rest
[01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:08.010]  of this thing.
[01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.770]  Are you in town next week?
[01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:11.210]  Maybe.
[01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.850]  What do you mean?
[01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:15.170]  That's such a gathered answer.
[01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:16.210]  Yes.
[01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:17.870]  Yeah, that's and I don't even do that anymore.
[01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:20.570]  I'm on top of my schedule these days.
[01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:21.230]  That's true.
[01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.950]  I wish you had my life and asked me that question.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.000]  It's quoting me back to me.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:31.460]  It's pretty good.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.480]  That's pretty good.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.560]  That was great.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.340]  Who are you closest to having a real argument with, Eric, in this company?
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.720]  In this one?
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.160]  The other day, it was you.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.200]  Me, what'd I do?
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.080]  Eight minutes after we launched the store.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.500]  Eight minutes after we launched the store.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.860]  Hey, should we do the design different?
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.240]  Are you out of your fucking mind?
[01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.120]  Shut up.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.000]  One, we already had that conversation.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.560]  We went through it.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.220]  We talked all the way through it.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:20.100]  We had that conversation eight minutes after the store launched.
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.060]  You wanted to talk about it again.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.420]  I have to give all the credit in the world to Andrew and Jeff for just stepping in and
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.180]  going, it's fine.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.320]  I was going to fucking flip.
[01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.020]  Sometimes you gotta sleep on it, you know?
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.300]  We're getting real sausage talking in our episodes.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:40.300]  Eight minutes after the launch.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.600]  Like, I don't understand.
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.040]  Eight minutes after we went live.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:44.340]  We hadn't talked about it yet.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.380]  No one knew about it yet.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.600]  Oh my, oh my god.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:54.120]  I would be on your side, Gavin, but we did have like several extensive conversations
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.700]  about design and locking it in.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.600]  I just, I just had a last minute concern.
[01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.180]  I thought that's after we did it.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:01.560]  Yeah.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.580]  Some stuff happens after other stuff.
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:09.160]  The problem though, Gavin, with what you did is what you vocalized is something I never,
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.420]  I thought, oh, we're all happy.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.220]  And then you did that.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.580]  And then it was all I could think about for the rest of that day.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.220]  Yeah.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:14.860]  And it was pointless.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:15.980]  Hmm.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.100]  But I do have some ideas.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:18.780]  I got to listen.
[01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:20.860]  I thought it, I thought it was pretty funny.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.520]  I would have felt, I would have felt worse if it was like f***face and I wouldn't,
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.960]  I wasn't in any of the meetings.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.660]  I went to every, I was in every discussion about it.
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.560]  I just felt differently afterwards.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.540]  And I was, I wasn't saying let's change it.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:38.380]  I was just putting it, I was putting a new angle, a new question to the group about it.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.100]  Was it?
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.760]  Sometimes it feels like you're just stirring the pot a little bit.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.640]  It kind of has.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.280]  I'm just trying to stir shit up.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.900]  I was just, I was literally just like, oh, I haven't thought about it from this point of view.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.560]  Let me put it to the group.
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:54.480]  Got it.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:54.720]  Shit.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.180]  Got shit.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:56.460]  I'm going to push back down my throat.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:58.980]  I mean, we've already discussed it.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.060]  I've already signed off on it.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:00.360]  I know.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.580]  I just had an additional concern and I didn't want to sit on it.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.040]  The last part where you say, I know is the part that none, that is not clear to any of us at all.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.040]  Gavin, I appreciate your honesty and your elucidation.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.880]  I also love how direct and forthright you are.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.860]  And I hope you never change.
[01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.560]  And we need that.
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.560]  We need that kind of honesty and bluntness in the company.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.400]  I appreciate when you're direct and forthright.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.560]  That's what I'm asking for.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.060]  That's why I can't accept sure as an answer.
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.640]  I wasn't trying to be overly direct.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.420]  I was just sometimes because, you know, I came from being a fan.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.620]  Sometimes I look at it differently from behind the scenes as I would,
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.740]  like as someone approaching the store as a fan.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.420]  I just thought, oh.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.460]  But it's just funny that you decided to have that approach after it all.
[01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:46.620]  Exactly. That is the issue.
[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:49.700]  Like, that's the issue is that it's after.
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.120]  I was just, yeah, just got perspective is great outside the box.
[01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.480]  Yeah. And I think like exact same way.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:57.720]  Same eyes on it.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.800]  It's the timing of it is what made it really fun.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.960]  I have no problem with you bringing it up.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.780]  I have a problem with it happening eight minutes after we launched.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.320]  OK, so barely than never.
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.980]  Not a part of your motto, Eric.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.000]  I immediately said, what do you want to do?
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:18.260]  We can get we can probably get a designer working on this.
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.980]  You know what? What is it that you want to see?
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:24.540]  To Eric's point, he has absolutely responded.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.220]  It was a very you could feel the anger in the words.
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.520]  But the words were, let's fix this concern immediately.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:32.360]  That's all. That's that's it.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:33.820]  So what are we fixing? Nothing.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:40.020]  And then it was all credit, all credit to Jeff and Andrew.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:40.580]  It's fine.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.640]  I would really like for Gavin to measure when it is no longer better late than never.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.420]  When is it crossed over?
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.560]  If the shirt is on people's bodies, it's too late.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.720]  That certainly is true.
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:59.560]  I would say if the shirt is in the mail, it's too late.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.340]  If the shirt has been printed, it's too late.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.380]  Yeah, hasn't hadn't yet.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.160]  No, we were pretty much right there, right there.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:09.500]  But I feel like that was the last opportunity.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:12.060]  We were right there.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.060]  But OK, here's the problem.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:19.820]  Once you've sold it to a customer as a thing, you can't then go back and retroactively change
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.840]  and go like, you know, we decided to tweak the design.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.420]  It's not the one we sold you.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.840]  It's one we've decided you'll like better.
[01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.220]  What if what about what about this?
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.020]  What if we literally patch the shirt?
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.440]  Sure, I love this shirt idea, Gavin, and I see exactly where you're going with it.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:49.080]  Allow me to jump in and modify the idea a little bit, because I think the problem is
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.300]  we can't patch a shirt unless the audience knows we're going to patch it for them.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.760]  So what if we get them to buy a shirt?
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.800]  And will it just be like a regulation shirt or some kind of design?
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.880]  And then but we let them know it's pre-patched
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:05.120]  and then at some point after they purchase it, we will patch it and then mail it to them.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:08.520]  And then we sell it as a shirt 1.1.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.780]  Yes, yes.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:15.560]  And then we just heat, we just like heat stamp a patch on or glue it or whatever.
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.540]  Shirt 1.1 is genius.
[01:09:18.140 --> 01:09:22.100]  We could also go the other way and just flex on the fact we're a merch store that promises
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.320]  no day one DLC.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.300]  We're going to deliver you the finalized product unlike all these other merch stores.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:29.960]  Very true.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.600]  At this point, have we been talking about this too much to not mention the actual issue I thought of?
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.040]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.820]  Well, we decided not to put the the asterisk logo on it.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.540]  We'll call it what it is. It's a bottle.
[01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:44.420]  Well, what's ironic is that you're you were really the one who led the charge in removing it.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:49.840]  Yes, you are the one who led the charge in removing it.
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.440]  You were the one that had a problem with it.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.160]  And once you pointed it out, I couldn't unsee it.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.120]  And then it drove me insane.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.380]  It didn't have it on at first.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:00.240]  And then I saw a few with it on and we decided that maybe it made sense to not have it on.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.520]  But then, after we all agreed upon it, from a purchaser's point of view,
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.260]  when it didn't have that on, I just thought, oh, someone could just print this, though.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:09.960]  Anyone could print anything.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.480]  But I like the idea that it is the most default shirt.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.640]  Like, that's the point.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.380]  If there's ever going to be a shirt that looks like anyone could have printed it,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.500]  it should be the regulation shirt.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.560]  It's just a regulation shirt. That's the purpose of the shirt.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.820]  If we were going to patch it, I would just have a piece of fabric that had the butthole on
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.620]  that people could sew onto the shirt.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.380]  You know where I'd put the butthole?
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.040]  I've been thinking about it since you said it.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:33.820]  You know where I'd put it?
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:34.580]  Where?
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.600]  Put it in the L. The regulation.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.640]  That's where I'd put it.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.600]  Well, it's not an asterisk in a letter, though, is it?
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:43.620]  Well, it's not a fucking... it's a logo for us.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:44.080]  It's not.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.660]  I like that idea, Andrew.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:48.900]  Here's what I would say.
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.480]  I also like the idea of patching a shirt.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.900]  I think we should come up for something.
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.200]  Let that idea simmer for a while and until we strike gold with it.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.760]  Like, can you imagine seeing a 1.1 in the wild?
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.840]  A shirt that someone bought and then later bought a patch for and sewed it on?
[01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:05.920]  Oh, dude, that's a phenomenal idea.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.320]  That's a pretty cool idea.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.900]  Yeah, that's pretty rad.
[01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.660]  I do like that.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.540]  Well, we should do that.
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.920]  Yeah, I think we should patch the shirt if people want it.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:19.900]  You know what else is rad?
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.300]  Episode 24 of this podcast.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:23.300]  That was rad.
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.300]  All I can think about is a patch.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:25.940]  I want to make a t-shirt.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.120]  We talked about it earlier, but I want to make a t-shirt that's black.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.560]  That's a pocket tee that just has the butthole on the pocket.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:32.280]  And that'll be awesome.
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.980]  It's like the reverse of the regulation shirt.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.860]  And it's like classy.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.040]  And nobody knows it's a butthole.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.160]  Who pointed it out?
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.680]  Who pointed out the other night at dinner, Jeff, that was like,
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:43.340]  oh, you guys, you make your star logo a point for each of you.
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:45.380]  And we went, oh.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.660]  I think it was Vanessa, maybe.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.240]  She mentioned how it was a five-pointed star.
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.980]  And it was assumed that it was intentional, one for each of us.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:55.480]  And we were like, absolutely.
[01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:56.780]  That is what that is.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.660]  And I'm so glad that it read.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:00.840]  Absolutely.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.320]  Because a lot of thought went into that.
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:03.020]  Definitely.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.800]  Well, thanks for listening.

[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:48.820]  I don't like it.
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:49.960]  I don't trust it.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:52.140]  What's causing the bubbles?
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.300]  That's the beta carotene.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:54.980]  Yeah.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.140]  Shit.
