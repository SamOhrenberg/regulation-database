[00:28.980 --> 00:36.280]  the stay. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. Episode 29. Jeff Ramsey,
[00:36.560 --> 00:43.660]  Eric Baddour, Gavin Frey, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton. Hello, boys. Hello. How's it going?
[00:44.280 --> 00:50.580]  It's okay. How are you guys doing? I'm great. I was all really excited to sit down and record
[00:50.580 --> 00:54.500]  two episodes with you guys today and then something happened. Oh, we're gonna record
[00:54.500 --> 00:58.340]  two episodes still? We can still do two episodes. What's wrong with that? Absolutely. Nah, we just
[00:58.340 --> 01:04.840]  got sidetracked a little bit. Threw off the rhythm. Rhythm is starting now, though. I mean,
[01:04.860 --> 01:11.840]  listen, you gotta shake out the jitters, Jeff. Gotta shake it out and get back on track. I don't
[01:11.840 --> 01:17.320]  know the rules of the lore of blindside. Are we allowed to talk about it after it happened or is
[01:17.320 --> 01:21.580]  it something that we shouldn't address? I think we could say that we just got blindsided, but then say no more.
[01:21.920 --> 01:26.620]  Yeah, then say no more. Okay. I'm glad because I was worried I was the only one that was going to
[01:26.620 --> 01:31.060]  utilize both my blindsides because we're getting near the end of the year. What do you mean both
[01:31.060 --> 01:36.800]  blindsides? How does the second one work? Let's play and a podcast. Right. Yeah. Have we ever
[01:36.800 --> 01:42.200]  had... what if two people blindside the same recording? Then that's a whole blindside day.
[01:42.300 --> 01:52.760]  That'd be quite the blindside. Then we'd pull out the wheel. Oh, man. Hey, did you guys see
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.460]  the comments on episode 28 from last week? No. During the episode I mentioned, it just
[01:59.460 --> 02:04.000]  struck me when we were recording that this was episode 28 of Regulation, but there was an episode
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  28 of F*** Face that we can directly compare and contrast, you know? Like, have we gotten better?
[02:09.080 --> 02:13.420]  Have we gotten worse? Are we funnier? Was the show similar or different? Well, people went back
[02:13.420 --> 02:18.000]  and looked at it and they found some shocking similarities between episode 28 of F*** Face
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.980]  and episode 28 of Regulation. And you guys aren't aware of any of these, right?
[02:21.980 --> 02:30.000]  No. No. Okay. Uh, apparently we spend some time talking about the Mike Tyson,
[02:30.140 --> 02:37.540]  Roy Jones Jr. fight. That is insanely specific. We mentioned, uh, have a conversation about how
[02:37.540 --> 02:43.380]  there's probably a NASA member in the community. We did that twice. That checks out. I remember
[02:43.380 --> 02:47.960]  that being a thing in the past. And there was one more. What was the other one? Let me look at my
[02:47.960 --> 02:54.200]  notes. Oh, I remember what it was now. I was complaining that there was a sensor on my car
[02:54.200 --> 03:00.520]  that was broken. Are you serious? For real? So much so that people in the audience are like,
[03:00.580 --> 03:04.860]  well, clearly Jeff did this on purpose and he went and listened to episode 28 of F*** Face
[03:04.860 --> 03:10.120]  and then seeded these things in so that we could find him. But that is not the case at all. It's
[03:10.120 --> 03:16.660]  just an insane, just an insane amount of coincidence. Or it just shows how shallow
[03:16.660 --> 03:21.980]  our conversation pool is. I don't know which. Maybe it's a combination. What's tough is back
[03:21.980 --> 03:25.820]  at that time, you're dealing with a lot of problems everywhere. Your tooth was broken.
[03:25.940 --> 03:31.420]  The house was broken. Your, your, your bike was broken and exploding. Like it's just,
[03:31.460 --> 03:38.020]  it's hard to keep track of what you have had like explode or break in your past.
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.420]  Pretty f***ing wild though. That, whatever that is, however many years later, four years later,
[03:43.420 --> 03:48.140]  three years later, we're essentially having the same problems talking about the exact same
[03:48.140 --> 03:53.600]  s***. Honestly, of all of them, the Roy Jones Jr. Mike Tyson fight being brought up is the oddest
[03:53.600 --> 03:58.320]  to me because I don't think I've thought about that since that time. I think I've thought about
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.140]  that twice and it was both those times. That's odder than a sensor on a car though. Sensor on
[04:03.140 --> 04:06.900]  a car too. Yeah. It was, uh, and then the conversation about whether somebody in the
[04:06.900 --> 04:11.940]  community is, works at NASA and can answer a question for us. So, uh, three pretty crazy
[04:11.940 --> 04:16.300]  things. Also, I think it was the first, it was a pretty lore heavy episode. Apparently it was
[04:16.300 --> 04:21.860]  the first time we discussed Andrew having an unbreakable nose. Oh, interesting. Which was
[04:21.860 --> 04:25.760]  the whole Mike Tyson conversation. Did we figure out if there was ever a hot dog on those desks
[04:25.760 --> 04:32.420]  that were going up? Why do I, why do I think that? I still think there's hot dogs. I did see a
[04:32.420 --> 04:37.660]  comment from somebody who said that the hot dog was never a part of it, but in the initial
[04:37.660 --> 04:42.800]  discussions, one of us mentioned throwing a hot dog on top of the desk. Okay. But it was like
[04:42.800 --> 04:47.660]  never, it was never explored. It was just like a throwaway line. I think. My brain has clung
[04:47.660 --> 04:52.220]  onto that and just holding on for dear life. That's what you took out of the whole experiment.
[04:52.680 --> 05:02.720]  Yes. There's something really gross about that. Just a naked, just a wiener on a table with
[05:02.720 --> 05:10.140]  nothing. A naked wiener? How are you going to say it like that? How else am I supposed to say it?
[05:10.960 --> 05:15.340]  Well, I think you said it when you just said it was a hot dog. A small, I don't, a hot dog to me
[05:15.340 --> 05:21.580]  implies a bun and condiments. Yeah. What I'm thinking about as being gross is just like the
[05:21.580 --> 05:32.700]  wiener itself exposed on a table. Uncooked. Just a raw dog on the table. I am so excited
[05:32.700 --> 05:36.580]  to record with you guys today because I have so much stuff I want to talk to you guys about.
[05:36.700 --> 05:42.600]  Oh, I'm excited. I've just been writing down notes like a little fiend. I had a product idea I want
[05:42.600 --> 05:48.420]  to, I want to sell you guys on. This is a really simple and easy one. It's not going to take me a
[05:48.420 --> 05:54.260]  long time to sell it to you. I don't think it's definitely a potential Unifarm product. Unifarm
[05:54.260 --> 05:58.620]  combining the power of one with fabric of the farm uniform. That is the first time I have said that
[05:58.620 --> 06:03.780]  in maybe since we started the new company and I briefly got scared. I wouldn't remember it.
[06:04.400 --> 06:10.720]  However, I was driving around yesterday. That wasn't, that's a lie. I was on a walk yesterday.
[06:10.880 --> 06:15.380]  Look at me lying to you guys. I was walking around yesterday. Why the fuck did I say I was driving?
[06:15.460 --> 06:19.500]  I'm not even driving my car right now because it's got a check engine light. I'm so full of shit.
[06:20.020 --> 06:24.440]  So wait, that's your car that has the engine light. Oh, I didn't tell you guys that. Yeah,
[06:24.440 --> 06:30.060]  we got home. We got home in Emily's car and dropped her car off. And then the next morning
[06:30.060 --> 06:34.940]  I got up and the check engine light was on in my car. Oh no. And I just haven't had time to
[06:34.940 --> 06:38.180]  fuck with it because we've been recording up a bunch to get ready for the holidays. You know,
[06:38.200 --> 06:41.240]  I've been, you know, having to record up on it. So all right as well. So it's just been a busy
[06:41.240 --> 06:47.040]  week. However, yesterday I was walking around and I saw somebody had a boat and it had a for sale
[06:47.040 --> 06:51.720]  sign on it, but the for sale sign was partially hidden. And for whatever reason, when I glanced
[06:51.720 --> 06:56.340]  at it, I read it wrong and I got really excited. And then I looked and I realized it wasn't what I
[06:56.340 --> 07:03.560]  thought it was, but then I realized what I thought it was is brilliant. Everybody sells for sale
[07:03.560 --> 07:08.360]  signs. Oh, you want to buy this house? It's for sale. Here's the sign. You want to buy this car,
[07:08.460 --> 07:17.260]  this boat, this RV? It's for sale, right? Yeah. Nobody sells not for sale signs. Think about it.
[07:17.260 --> 07:25.140]  It's like a wedding ring for your product. Put it on your car, on your boat, on your RV and let
[07:25.140 --> 07:32.020]  people know this sucker is off the market. Don't even think about it. Divert your eyes and your
[07:32.020 --> 07:37.460]  attention because this is my bass boat, not yours. It is not on the market. It won't be on the market.
[07:37.600 --> 07:43.840]  It is not for sale. If this takes off, maybe that becomes the norm. And if something doesn't have
[07:43.840 --> 07:50.420]  a sign, you know, it's for sale. Exactly. I especially like this idea for houses. The premise
[07:50.420 --> 07:56.540]  of you have a for sale sign on your house and then a not for sale above it. So people know it
[07:56.540 --> 08:02.940]  will be for sale, but not currently. So just keep it in mind. I like that. So we'll just say not for
[08:02.940 --> 08:09.760]  sale. Don't call this number. Yeah. You know how people have like no trespassing, not for sale.
[08:09.760 --> 08:15.080]  Don't call. I think that would be so much more intrigue, though. If I parked a car somewhere
[08:15.080 --> 08:19.720]  and said not for sale, don't call this number. I think you get more people calling. Well, Gavin,
[08:19.740 --> 08:26.300]  I'm glad you said that because there are secondary uses to a not for sale sign. Nothing entices a
[08:26.300 --> 08:32.140]  person more than recognizing something that they can't have. What if you do want to sell your house
[08:32.140 --> 08:37.920]  or your bass boat or your RV, Gavin, but you're having trouble drumming up interest? It's hard to
[08:37.920 --> 08:43.020]  sell a house in America in 2024. The market crashed. It's not doing well. Nobody's got extra
[08:43.020 --> 08:49.720]  money. The interest rates are too high. It's hard to stand out from the fray, especially with all
[08:49.720 --> 08:55.340]  the competition. So why not take yourself off the market and put yourself on the market at the same
[08:55.340 --> 09:02.340]  time? Dangle your house, your bass boat, your RV, your trailer in front of the people, but say, no,
[09:02.440 --> 09:07.080]  it's not for you. It's not for sale. You can't have this. I don't care how much money you have.
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.280]  I don't want to sell it to you. And then they go home and they're like, yeah, I need to buy a house.
[09:11.340 --> 09:15.060]  And that one was nice, but the one that's not for sale and they say it's not for sale. Why would
[09:15.060 --> 09:18.000]  they say that? There's got to be something really fucking great about that house. I bet people are
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.320]  going by that house all the time. They're like, hey, I want to buy your house. And they're like,
[09:20.360 --> 09:24.120]  oh my God, it's not for sale. I had to put a fucking sign up in front of the house to let
[09:24.120 --> 09:27.900]  people know to stop trying to buy it. It's not for sale. I've got to buy that house.
[09:30.360 --> 09:35.980]  I like this idea a lot. Can I make a suggestion as another sign maybe in this form?
[09:35.980 --> 09:42.360]  Yeah, absolutely. So we have not for sale. I really want a could be bought sign. Not currently
[09:42.360 --> 09:47.740]  for sale. Not opposed to selling it. Could be bought though. You like this enough? You throw
[09:47.740 --> 09:53.780]  enough money at me? I could make this. Could be bought. That's better than make an offer.
[09:54.280 --> 09:56.880]  Should we put some stuff up in the regulation store that's not for sale?
[09:58.140 --> 09:58.900]  Convince me.
[10:00.680 --> 10:02.000]  Make a deal.
[10:03.880 --> 10:06.380]  Convince me just on its own could mean anything.
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.600]  What if it says hear me out and then the price?
[10:17.240 --> 10:25.580]  Anyway, guys, we had so much success with our protected by Falcons and no scrumping signs. It
[10:25.580 --> 10:30.540]  just it seems like a natural place, a natural playground for us to play if you will.
[10:30.540 --> 10:32.260]  Regulation not for sale.
[10:36.020 --> 10:42.360]  Maybe we do like a poll or something to see what what the people need. Like we we come up with not
[10:42.360 --> 10:46.620]  for sale could be bought. Maybe like let the audience pick and then we'll make that thing.
[10:46.840 --> 10:50.520]  Yeah, I like that idea. I'm telling you, dude, if we make a not for sale sign,
[10:50.580 --> 10:57.420]  people are going to buy it. I would buy a not for sale. Of course you would. Of course you would.
[10:57.420 --> 11:03.960]  Think about all the things that you own that are not for sale, that you don't want people to buy
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.060]  from you. What about you take it a step further? You put a second mailbox next to your original
[11:09.060 --> 11:17.080]  mailbox and put a sign on it that says not for mail. And see which one. Oh, it's not for mail,
[11:17.540 --> 11:21.300]  but you can see if the postman ever or the post person ever puts mail in it.
[11:21.340 --> 11:25.480]  Now, do you think they would do that because they were being defiant or not paying?
[11:25.480 --> 11:34.180]  Yeah, probably just rebelling. Yeah, I hear the mailman likes to rebel a little bit, but it's true.
[11:37.440 --> 11:43.400]  I just the idea to counterintuitive signs on things. It's so fascinating.
[11:44.620 --> 11:49.720]  Having like having like a sign on a car that says not for driving, like just there's so many
[11:49.720 --> 11:58.280]  just reverse engineer. Yeah, I like it. I like it, too. A non-emergency exit.
[11:59.960 --> 12:05.340]  It's going to get people killed, probably. What about a not for signing sign? Not for signing?
[12:05.620 --> 12:08.980]  Not for signing. Like it has like a signature thing on it. It's not for signing.
[12:09.300 --> 12:15.230]  It's a not for signing sign. Don't sign the sign.
[12:15.630 --> 12:24.410]  Oh, man. Well, that's my that's my that's my uniform uniform.
[12:24.510 --> 12:28.930]  Grinding the power of one with the fabric of the farm uniform idea for the episode and the first,
[12:29.130 --> 12:33.750]  I think, of regulation. I would put up a not for sale sign on my house.
[12:34.150 --> 12:37.150]  Well, you should. I think it would make my neighbors talk to me, though.
[12:37.730 --> 12:43.450]  It probably would. What if it was a sign it yourself sign or it's just a sign that you
[12:43.450 --> 12:47.850]  could insert whatever you want, like you write on the side, like it looks like a stop sign,
[12:47.930 --> 12:54.090]  but you could put go on it. It'd be terrible. Should we sell a secondary sign for you,
[12:54.190 --> 12:56.810]  Gavin, that you can put under your not for sale that says no talking?
[13:00.790 --> 13:06.610]  Not for sale and don't ask me about it. There should be you know how like hotels have.
[13:07.950 --> 13:12.830]  This is a really dumb idea. You know, hotels have those things you can slide on the door
[13:12.830 --> 13:18.330]  that indicate like, hey, don't disturb me. Don't talk to me. There should be because some there are
[13:18.330 --> 13:22.030]  neighbors that are very chatty that want to be social and other friends and there are other
[13:22.030 --> 13:27.150]  people that are like, I don't want to talk to anybody. And there's no like sign that is universal
[13:27.150 --> 13:32.570]  to indicate that maybe the trash cans you put in front of your house, maybe they're social cans,
[13:32.650 --> 13:38.170]  the non-social cans. Oh, maybe they're a different color that indicates your willingness to interact
[13:38.170 --> 13:43.250]  with your neighbors. Oh, so it's like less rude than a sign that says don't ever talk to me.
[13:43.370 --> 13:47.450]  Yeah. It's like a visual cue of like, oh, they're just not social as like you don't
[13:48.250 --> 13:52.150]  you avoid the awkward conversation. They could just see it and know like, oh, I don't. They
[13:52.150 --> 13:56.410]  don't want to talk to me. It's not personal. Back before the Internet in the old days,
[13:56.410 --> 14:00.590]  when you would work at a company, people, if you wanted to be social, you would congregate
[14:00.590 --> 14:04.850]  around the water cooler. That's how you would have a conversation or talk about Seinfeld or
[14:04.850 --> 14:08.330]  friends or whatever the night before. Everybody would just meet around the water cooler. What if
[14:08.330 --> 14:12.170]  you just wheel a water cooler out into your driveway and then that lets all your neighbors
[14:12.170 --> 14:18.950]  know you're open for conversation? That's interesting. People like water. People love
[14:18.950 --> 14:26.170]  water. Look at Gavin. That dude's all about water. That's true. Did you ever go to a water
[14:26.170 --> 14:28.910]  cooler at work and no one else came over so you had to just leave?
[14:36.610 --> 14:42.250]  Yes. Was it a recent team? No, it was at the radio station. You just wanted to chat about
[14:42.250 --> 14:47.330]  the game and no one gave a shit? Sitting there, sipping on water, waiting, and no one came.
[14:49.090 --> 14:52.130]  Go back to work. I really want to talk about the game that happened last night.
[14:52.330 --> 14:56.350]  Just standing there. I guess nobody else does. People are wondering why you're
[14:57.130 --> 15:08.370]  pissing so much that day. You brought up Seinfeld and friends. It's funny to me the concept of
[15:10.250 --> 15:13.770]  everyone's into friends and there's the one person who's deep into The Sopranos.
[15:14.410 --> 15:17.290]  It's like, you believe Phoebe and the cat? And then there's this one person who's like,
[15:17.550 --> 15:23.370]  Tony Soprano whacked that guy. You see that? They chopped his hands off. That was crazy. Who's
[15:23.370 --> 15:30.910]  keeping up? If you just took a bunch of signs to a hotel that they all just said, disturbances,
[15:31.110 --> 15:36.710]  welcome. And you just put them on random rooms. Do you think the staff would go in? No. Oh,
[15:36.750 --> 15:42.190]  if you just like hung signs that says like, please enter on all the doors. I like that
[15:42.190 --> 15:47.830]  you phrased that as disturbances welcome. The opposite of do not disturb. Sure.
[15:48.830 --> 15:54.630]  Knocking. No knocking necessary. Come on in. Door unlocked. I was once in a hotel room,
[15:55.330 --> 15:59.190]  taking a dump and the bathroom door was open because there was no one else in the room with
[15:59.190 --> 16:04.090]  me. I just thought, you know, why would I shut that door? And then a housekeeping walked in
[16:04.710 --> 16:08.550]  because Barbara had taken the do not disturb sign off my door and put it on hers.
[16:08.550 --> 16:15.150]  Oh. Only works in hotels when you're not staying with other people.
[16:17.010 --> 16:21.730]  It's interesting that it's a front door only thing too. Like the culture hasn't gone beyond that.
[16:21.970 --> 16:24.090]  You think it should be on the bathroom door? Well, that's what I'm saying. Like,
[16:24.130 --> 16:28.170]  you don't necessarily mind anyone being in any other part of the hotel room at that point.
[16:28.730 --> 16:33.050]  I don't want them changing the sheets while I'm taking a dump. Why not? It's a different room.
[16:33.890 --> 16:37.470]  You're not there. Just stand in there and wait for them to finish after I'm done.
[16:37.470 --> 16:40.750]  They're going to hear it, dude. They're going to hear everything.
[16:42.010 --> 16:48.230]  Maybe you have quiet dumps, but I do not. That would not be good for the poor woman or man
[16:48.230 --> 16:55.090]  making my bed. I just think it's a thing that should be considered of individualized door do
[16:55.090 --> 17:00.630]  not disturbs. Well, there is that on just normal bathroom doors. It's like the red and the green
[17:01.510 --> 17:08.310]  That's true. Yeah, I think I think almost if I'm correct, I could be wrong, but I think almost
[17:08.310 --> 17:14.690]  every door has it built in. It's called a lock. That's the do not disturb, right? You lock the door.
[17:15.470 --> 17:18.850]  Yeah, but then there's the awkward moment sometimes where someone tries to open the
[17:18.850 --> 17:24.730]  lock door not knowing that someone's in it. That's awkward for them. That's not awkward for you.
[17:24.910 --> 17:28.970]  I just don't want that experience. I don't like it. I don't like it on any side.
[17:28.970 --> 17:33.270]  I think all bathroom locks should have a white noise machine built in.
[17:34.750 --> 17:40.390]  When it locks, it just goes. I do like that. I do. I do like that idea.
[17:40.530 --> 17:45.650]  Like fake flushes. So you can't tell this flush is going off constantly,
[17:45.770 --> 17:48.670]  regardless of if there's anyone in there. Yeah. Or the sound of a tap.
[17:49.250 --> 17:51.730]  Yeah. That'll help you if you're having trouble peeing, too.
[17:52.210 --> 17:55.790]  Maybe we could sell Jeff's pisses as our door lock.
[17:59.990 --> 18:05.130]  Oh, that's interesting. Although masking the sound of something with the exact same thing.
[18:05.790 --> 18:10.290]  I'm not sure how effective that is. I bet it could be. I bet it could be pretty
[18:10.290 --> 18:13.870]  effective. Remember how I turned pee into a whole beautiful waterfall?
[18:14.470 --> 18:17.670]  That was beautiful. Do you think if you put
[18:18.390 --> 18:24.230]  like a do not use or in needs of repair in front of a completely functioning escalator,
[18:24.230 --> 18:27.610]  people would just not use it? Do you think you would just avoid it?
[18:28.010 --> 18:31.630]  Even though it just looks... If an escalator said do not walk on or
[18:31.630 --> 18:34.250]  do not use it, it was running. I definitely wouldn't go on it.
[18:35.690 --> 18:38.710]  I'd be worried I'd fall through. Do you think you'd fall through?
[18:39.070 --> 18:41.550]  Well, it happens, doesn't it? What if it was a sign that says
[18:41.550 --> 18:45.970]  do not use unless you want to go up or down, but that's in smaller letters.
[18:48.090 --> 18:50.710]  There's a lot you could do with signs, Jeff. This is a great idea
[18:50.710 --> 18:55.430]  because it could even be if you're like a bad liar, like I have a good hand and you're playing
[18:55.430 --> 19:02.150]  blackjack. Just hold hold the card up. Try to bluff. Because it's really just delivering a
[19:02.150 --> 19:05.730]  message with dishonesty is what we're talking about, but in a way that seems like there's
[19:05.730 --> 19:08.250]  an authority behind it. What if the next time we record,
[19:08.350 --> 19:13.850]  we all have to present a new sign? Well, two episodes from now,
[19:13.890 --> 19:15.210]  because we're doing back to backs. Yeah.
[19:15.230 --> 19:18.770]  To set the expectation. The next time we record is in 45 minutes.
[19:18.770 --> 19:21.730]  You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm just setting the expectation
[19:21.730 --> 19:24.230]  for the audience because they don't necessarily know. I'm just saying not next episode,
[19:24.330 --> 19:29.990]  but the episode after. I love it. Let's do it. A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant,
[19:30.290 --> 19:36.550]  especially these days. Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated and it just
[19:36.550 --> 19:43.990]  feels so good. Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[19:45.650 --> 19:50.730]  suddenly it seems quite practical. The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[19:51.070 --> 19:56.270]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.
[19:57.270 --> 20:01.870]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter Group and
[20:01.870 --> 20:05.810]  Chocolaty Corp. Joining me is a PBC executive. Thanks for having me, Barry.
[20:06.190 --> 20:11.070]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it, Jif Peanut Butter and Chocolate Flavored
[20:11.070 --> 20:17.410]  Spread would be a success? You know, it was a gut feeling, a rumbling, if you will. Besides,
[20:17.810 --> 20:22.350]  they're two titans of taste. Very true. Goes great with pretzels. And pancakes.
[20:22.890 --> 20:28.570]  Apples too, I bet. Try Jif PBC today. While we're setting up expectations and
[20:28.570 --> 20:32.530]  discussing new stuff, I wanted to present you guys, I had an idea for a new segment we could
[20:32.530 --> 20:36.810]  do that anybody could do. And it's not one that has to be, that should be weekly. It's just like
[20:36.810 --> 20:44.290]  whenever you see it and it happens. And I want to call it the worst products in the world. And it's
[20:44.290 --> 20:49.910]  just things that you see that should not exist, but for some reason do. I'll start off with this
[20:49.910 --> 20:54.930]  one. I was at H-E-B the other day where I discovered, or maybe it was Target, I can't remember,
[20:55.250 --> 21:02.910]  where I discovered Twinkies and Pop-Tarts Frosted Strawberry Scented Body Wash.
[21:03.470 --> 21:06.210]  Oh, that seems good. Twinkies Body Wash.
[21:06.210 --> 21:12.310]  Yeah, that seems fine to me. You want to wash your body with a Twinkie? You want to wash your body
[21:12.310 --> 21:16.750]  with the smell of a Pop-Tart? Well, that's the thing, is you would be done and then you would
[21:16.750 --> 21:24.910]  get out and you would go, I smell like Pop-Tarts. Everyone will love this. I'm all about crossovers
[21:24.910 --> 21:30.110]  and trying to come up with clever new things for your business, but I just can't imagine
[21:30.510 --> 21:36.810]  wanting to get clean with Twinkies. So is that like a bar of soap, the Twinkie?
[21:37.010 --> 21:41.370]  Is that what I'm looking at? Or a bath bomb? Or it might be a scrubber? I don't know. I think
[21:41.370 --> 21:45.590]  it's like a sponge. I think it's like a sponge or like a loofah. See, I'd go for the sponge.
[21:46.010 --> 21:51.010]  Yeah, see, I think it's a great shape. I think it's functionally perfect. I think the Pop-Tart
[21:51.010 --> 21:54.790]  looks bad, but... Yeah, the Pop-Tart is why they didn't just go with a Pop-Tart. They actually put
[21:55.750 --> 22:03.510]  I'm more disturbed by the big jar of soap that smells like Pop-Tarts and Twinkies. There's
[22:03.510 --> 22:08.290]  nothing clean about either of those things, guys. They don't say clean. When I think of
[22:08.290 --> 22:13.770]  Twinkies and Pop-Tarts, I think of sticky fingers. I don't think of being like alpine fresh.
[22:14.510 --> 22:18.410]  Yeah, but alpines aren't clean. Yeah, come on. They are. They're kind of clean.
[22:18.410 --> 22:25.870]  Do you think oranges are clean? Is fruit clean to you? Yeah, I think it's cleaner than a Twinkie
[22:25.870 --> 22:30.510]  made in a factory. I do. This is what I'd argue. I don't think I'm being crazy. I think you're
[22:30.510 --> 22:37.910]  being contrarian just for the podcast. I appreciate that, but I think everybody here recognizes that
[22:37.910 --> 22:42.730]  this is a terrible product that doesn't need to exist. Feel free to defend it all you want,
[22:42.850 --> 22:48.170]  but I know your heart's not in it. I'm arguing about cleanliness. If I buy a
[22:48.170 --> 22:53.690]  Twinkie from a store, I can just eat the Twinkie. If I buy strawberries, I gotta wash them first.
[22:54.450 --> 23:00.170]  Twinkies are cleaner. Twinkies are a cleaner product. Is it clean or do you just expect it
[23:00.170 --> 23:04.830]  to be clean? What do you mean? What's the last thing it touched? A bunch of conveyor belts and
[23:04.830 --> 23:10.890]  shit and robots? It's chemicals that I can eat. It's chemical to hell. The only reason you don't
[23:10.890 --> 23:15.010]  think you need to wash it is because nobody's made a TikTok telling you to wash your Twinkies
[23:15.010 --> 23:19.810]  before you eat them. No, that wouldn't change anything. I mean, there's a reason to wash fruit.
[23:20.330 --> 23:26.330]  I'm just saying that as far as consumption goes, it is technically, I guess, cleaner. I don't know.
[23:27.410 --> 23:31.350]  So when you think cleanliness, when you think going in and taking a shower,
[23:32.030 --> 23:36.490]  Twinkie is the first thing you think of? No, definitely not. But it's going to smell sweet.
[23:37.210 --> 23:40.430]  I don't want either of these products, but they're not the worst thing ever.
[23:40.430 --> 23:45.810]  Like, I get why there's a market for them. Couldn't disagree with you more. I think this
[23:45.810 --> 23:51.110]  is the most useless, disgusting product ever made. Maybe it should be on Does It Do season three.
[23:53.670 --> 23:57.490]  Well, if we want it to be on season three of Does It Do, we should tell Gracie no.
[24:00.190 --> 24:05.030]  I don't see... I think we have to get this now. Try it. I don't think it's that bad.
[24:05.590 --> 24:09.870]  Since you go right at it, dude. I don't get why you're so opposed to this.
[24:10.270 --> 24:17.010]  Because it's fucking gross, chemically food that's not associated with clean or fresh.
[24:17.230 --> 24:22.490]  Nobody thinks like, oh, I want a fresh Pop-Tart. I don't know. Like, that sounds good to me.
[24:22.590 --> 24:27.730]  A fresh Pop-Tart. I want to smell Pop-Tart fresh. Oh. Yeah, not phrasing, but like, once again,
[24:27.810 --> 24:31.850]  it's just all sweet shit. Like, it's supposed to... you're going to smell sweet.
[24:31.850 --> 24:35.910]  Why do you want to smell like a bunch of sugar? Why do you want to smell like a bunch of
[24:35.910 --> 24:40.230]  strawberries? I don't know. I don't want to smell like strawberries. Well, then why are you buying
[24:40.230 --> 24:44.730]  all this strawberry shampoo, Jeff? I'm not. I'm not buying strawberry shampoo. I never said...
[24:44.730 --> 24:49.030]  you're the only person who's talked about strawberries today. What about limes? Lime
[24:49.030 --> 24:54.510]  shampoo? There's a lot of fruit-based shampoos. Well, lime's acidic. It's probably astringent
[24:54.510 --> 25:00.050]  and helps clean. What? Why? What is going on? I really don't know. We're talking about shampoos.
[25:00.050 --> 25:05.630]  You're talking about shampoos. Is this not shampoo? It's body wash. Well, it's the same.
[25:06.750 --> 25:11.670]  This conversation gets... it just keeps going. Jeff, why do you smell like strawberries? I don't.
[25:11.710 --> 25:16.130]  Then why do you smell like limes? Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to rescind my idea of a worst
[25:16.130 --> 25:21.710]  products ever invented segment for the podcast and move on to the next one, which I have,
[25:21.750 --> 25:25.830]  which is why does the McDonald's and Walmart smell better than any other McDonald's?
[25:26.670 --> 25:30.670]  Maybe it's because you're so bored of being in Walmart. It's everything's heightened.
[25:31.230 --> 25:35.430]  I never want to eat McDonald's more than when I'm walking through a fucking Walmart and it just
[25:35.430 --> 25:41.830]  smells. It's everywhere. The smell. It's amazing. Yeah. When else are you near a McDonald's?
[25:42.690 --> 25:44.690]  I mean, when I'm at a McDonald's, it doesn't smell that good.
[25:45.470 --> 25:50.150]  Right. But it's maybe because you went in expecting McDonald's. Yeah, I think that has
[25:50.150 --> 25:53.710]  something to do with it. I think they're doing something. I think they're enhancing the smells
[25:53.710 --> 25:58.710]  of the McDonald's and Walmart's. They gotta be. I'm telling you. It's like the idea of Jeff sat
[25:58.710 --> 26:05.670]  in a McDonald's and then just going, oh shit, like noticing the menu. If you could smell like
[26:05.670 --> 26:13.030]  anything in a McDonald's, what would you want to smell like? Pop-Tart. Oh, a McDonald's Pop-Tart?
[26:13.090 --> 26:18.350]  And I can if I clean myself with my Pop-Tart body wash, which is a good product and should exist.
[26:18.350 --> 26:26.310]  Jesus Christ. This is the first episode recorded after, well, right before the
[26:26.310 --> 26:32.370]  GERPL went on sale, but after for the audience. So we don't know if there was a giant shit show
[26:32.370 --> 26:37.150]  or not yet. What are your predictions? I think it's going to go fine. I think it went well.
[26:37.450 --> 26:42.990]  I think somehow we sold out and people still got annoyed that we didn't have enough.
[26:42.990 --> 26:48.850]  Oh yeah, absolutely. Also, we haven't talked about it. We sold it for a dollar cheaper than we ever
[26:48.850 --> 26:53.310]  sold it before, just because we were able to. Yeah, we were looking at it and they were like,
[26:53.330 --> 26:56.510]  you just want to sell it for the same prices as you did at Rooseteeth. And we were looking
[26:56.510 --> 27:00.950]  at the margin and we were like, that seems, it just seems like it seems high. Can we,
[27:01.070 --> 27:04.410]  can we sell it for less? And they were very kind about it and they were like, yeah,
[27:04.410 --> 27:08.370]  you can do that. But they looked at us like, you want to sell merchandise for less?
[27:08.370 --> 27:13.310]  You know, we're like, yeah, we want to lower the price. And it was like, it took them for a second
[27:13.310 --> 27:18.750]  for their brains to catch up with the concept of, yeah, but we are selling it for a dollar cheaper.
[27:18.910 --> 27:23.570]  And we haven't talked about this yet either. This will probably come up in a sausage talk,
[27:23.670 --> 27:28.770]  but I'm assuming if we sold out, we, we had some benchmarks. If we sold out in the day,
[27:28.850 --> 27:32.710]  then we already ordered 4,000 more. And there are, the order's already been placed
[27:32.710 --> 27:39.430]  and they'll be here February 1st. Wait, so we're following up selling 4,000 with ordering
[27:39.430 --> 27:44.030]  another 4,000? We can order 2,000. We can do 2,000 if you don't want 4,000 Gavin.
[27:44.490 --> 27:51.890]  Well, I'm the one who wanted 5,000. Then what are you, wait, then what is this?
[27:52.410 --> 27:58.450]  Well, I, I was wanting 5,000 initially. Okay. But what you're talking about is 8,000.
[27:58.450 --> 28:02.770]  Okay. Okay. So, so, so wait, hang on, Jeff. Let me, I just want to really drill down here.
[28:03.710 --> 28:09.710]  So 4,000 is what we went with. In the eventuality that we sell out of them at the ready, we have
[28:09.710 --> 28:18.690]  2,000 or 4,000. You seem upset about getting 4,000 more. How many more do you want? 1,000?
[28:18.830 --> 28:24.890]  So we only, so we get to 5,000? Or do you want more? Do you want us to increase the order
[28:24.890 --> 28:30.190]  higher than 4,000? Is that what you're saying? No, I'm just worried that there's going to be
[28:30.190 --> 28:37.410]  like 5,000 people who really want them. And then 1,000 people will be annoyed. And then we'll
[28:37.410 --> 28:45.030]  order 4,000 more and we'll have 3,000 left over. You think they're crazy. You just described
[28:45.030 --> 28:51.910]  supply and demand and commerce. Yes. This Econ 101 lesson brought to you by Gavin.
[28:51.910 --> 28:57.650]  That is exactly the fear that we have. We're selling it for a dollar cheaper. Gavin,
[28:57.770 --> 29:03.410]  everything we're doing is against Econ. We're selling it for cheaper. The reason we didn't buy
[29:03.410 --> 29:08.690]  5,000 was because it's expensive and we didn't have the money yet to buy 5,000. But if we take
[29:08.690 --> 29:14.590]  the money from the 4,000, assuming we sell them, we can invest in more Gerblers if you want. I
[29:14.590 --> 29:20.490]  think that we're going to hit a point where we have Gerblers on the shelves and that's okay.
[29:20.490 --> 29:25.370]  We're just trying to find that point. Maybe we'll have 2,000 Gerblers on the shelves,
[29:25.530 --> 29:29.910]  but we don't want to have 12,000 Gerblers on the shelves. Gavin, how many... Okay,
[29:30.130 --> 29:35.630]  so let's say we live in a world in which we ordered the 5,000 that you said. What would
[29:35.630 --> 29:41.070]  you want the restock to be? I imagine that we wouldn't need a sudden restock. I would have
[29:41.070 --> 29:48.070]  thought that around 5,000... Okay, but this is for a scenario, this is to be clear, a scenario in
[29:48.870 --> 29:53.310]  which people are upset about it. Which is what you're saying would have happened if we ordered
[29:53.310 --> 29:59.950]  5,000. So they would have sold out and we would have zero and then we would just not reorder any
[29:59.950 --> 30:06.130]  period. How did you arrive at the number of 5,000, by the way? We arrived at the number of 4,000
[30:06.130 --> 30:10.810]  because it was double the biggest order we ever had at Rooster Teeth and it was about as much
[30:10.810 --> 30:15.750]  as we thought we could afford. 5,000 is an arbitrary number you threw out. It sounds cool,
[30:15.750 --> 30:18.950]  I love the idea, but I'm just wondering where you're arriving at that number because you
[30:20.110 --> 30:25.190]  set it as a benchmark, but it seems... Okay, let me explain my reasoning. My reasoning for 5,000
[30:25.190 --> 30:29.250]  was that I don't think necessarily there's going to be that many people who want them,
[30:29.270 --> 30:34.190]  so we may be left over some. I see. Without everyone getting annoyed. What I'm worried
[30:34.190 --> 30:38.850]  about is the 4,000 people buy them, some people can't buy them, those people get annoyed because
[30:38.850 --> 30:45.750]  they couldn't get one, which I kind of understand, but then there's not going to be 4,000 annoyed
[30:45.750 --> 30:52.510]  people. Then we will have a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand Gerplers in stock so that
[30:52.510 --> 30:57.910]  whenever somebody wants to buy one, they can and they don't have to wait for a three-time-a-year
[30:57.910 --> 31:03.150]  Gerpler drop. I would like to get to a point where we have Gerplers on the shelves for people to buy
[31:03.150 --> 31:08.450]  at the ready, but not too many, and we have to increment our way into that or we're going to end
[31:08.450 --> 31:15.950]  up losing our fucking asses on Gerplers. So should we only restock 2,000? I think it depends.
[31:16.110 --> 31:19.850]  I just don't know how you can make that cool without knowing how quickly they sell out.
[31:19.990 --> 31:23.290]  That's the whole point. Right. That's why we're not making the call now. No one here is saying
[31:23.290 --> 31:27.990]  that we make the call right now, but you seem to be, so I'm curious about where you stand.
[31:28.010 --> 31:31.090]  You said if they're going to sell out in a day, you're going to order 4,000.
[31:31.430 --> 31:35.950]  Here's the call that we came up with that we all talked about. Yeah, we have 2,000 or 4,000
[31:35.950 --> 31:41.570]  at the ready. Yeah, we can order. If we sell out instantly, like within the first couple hours,
[31:41.830 --> 31:47.030]  then we think we'll order another 4,000 and take the risk. If we don't sell out through the weekend,
[31:47.050 --> 31:55.490]  then we'll order 2,000 on Monday. Okay. What is your best case? My best case scenario?
[31:56.070 --> 32:01.810]  Yeah, I don't know. That we sell 4,000 Gerplers in 18 seconds and everybody's happy?
[32:03.030 --> 32:08.690]  Yeah, those two things can't exist. Yeah, I don't think those exist. If we have exactly 4,000
[32:08.690 --> 32:15.110]  customers and they all want to buy one each. I hope we sell like 3,500 and then it kind of
[32:15.110 --> 32:20.850]  dribbles out and I think everyone will be happy. Yeah, that'd be great. That's great too. Yeah,
[32:20.850 --> 32:24.430]  there's really not a bad scenario in what you've described. There is a bad scenario.
[32:24.810 --> 32:30.910]  Yeah, and that's why I added to what you described. No, I mean, that's really touching
[32:30.910 --> 32:34.110]  and amazing that that happened. That's more than double than we ever ordered and we'll order more
[32:34.670 --> 32:38.710]  and I think people will be understanding. We're an independent small company trying to do our
[32:38.710 --> 32:44.190]  first big sale. You're confusing me in just as badly as Andrew did in the last segment.
[32:44.630 --> 32:50.310]  I really don't know what you think we've done wrong here other than not order 5,000 instead
[32:50.310 --> 32:56.550]  of 4,000. Why do you think that there's 4,000 customers? I think whatever the next product is
[32:56.550 --> 33:00.290]  and then sorry for interrupting, you can answer just question after this, but whatever we sell
[33:00.290 --> 33:05.530]  next in this type of fashion of having to order quantities, Gavin needs to pick an exact number
[33:05.530 --> 33:11.550]  that he thinks it will be. Yeah, I think we nominate Gavin to be in charge of ordering all merch from
[33:11.550 --> 33:16.810]  here on out because please, I'll be honest, I did it for the first nine years of Rooster Teeth and
[33:16.810 --> 33:21.950]  I'm not looking to do it again. Just for one. My only fear with it is that every time we've
[33:21.950 --> 33:27.030]  sold one of these freaking cups, we've never ordered enough. The people have been really
[33:27.030 --> 33:32.730]  I agree, but we've ordered double the largest order we've ever made. I don't know what more
[33:32.730 --> 33:36.950]  we can do. We'll order more in the future, but we need the money from the Gerblers
[33:36.950 --> 33:42.450]  before we can order. The magic's on the tapes, Gavin. I can't sell the tape unless you give me
[33:42.450 --> 33:51.470]  the tape. To quote Boogie Nights. It's going to be a learning process. No matter what happens,
[33:51.570 --> 33:56.430]  we're going to learn from this experience and I hope it goes incredibly well. Yeah, I think
[33:56.430 --> 34:04.530]  in my head I was just hoping for our first launch of a GERB as a regulation GERB. I hoped
[34:04.530 --> 34:09.750]  we wouldn't be sold out so quickly. Well, maybe we won't. We have no idea. We've never sold more
[34:09.750 --> 34:14.810]  than 2,000 at once before. Okay, so we should be good. We should be fine. Maybe. Maybe not.
[34:14.950 --> 34:18.190]  I don't know. We're going to find out. I'm so scared. But that's why we have it waiting in
[34:18.190 --> 34:23.010]  the wings for the 2,000 or the 4,000 so they know, hey, we're probably going to restock one
[34:23.010 --> 34:26.710]  of these two things based on how this goes. Yeah, so we'll know instantly and then we can
[34:26.710 --> 34:31.050]  immediately communicate and go, great, we know our baseline now. We have some more data. We're
[34:31.050 --> 34:36.010]  going to adjust orders going forward. And we were talking about this earlier before you came on,
[34:36.230 --> 34:41.850]  Gavin. The goal would be for there always to be a GERBler in the store, but for us never to carry
[34:41.850 --> 34:46.890]  so much stock that it eats away at the profitability of the GERBler because carrying stock gets very
[34:46.890 --> 34:52.690]  expensive very fast. Yeah, and they're not small. We just don't know. All we've sold so far is a
[34:52.690 --> 34:56.930]  print-on-demand T-shirt and all the data from a previous company that we no longer have access
[34:56.930 --> 35:01.730]  to, you know? Yeah. I'm not saying that we've done anything wrong yet. I'm just, I have hopes.
[35:02.150 --> 35:07.170]  Right. It's just the tone, it's just the tone you're using the whole time. It's entirely possible
[35:07.170 --> 35:12.590]  we have done stuff wrong yet because this comes out after the launch, but we are dumber right now
[35:12.590 --> 35:19.630]  than the audience. Yeah. Yeah. I think we all have the same fear. I'm just, I'm just freaking out
[35:19.630 --> 35:26.150]  about it. What do you mean? I'm not scared. You're not scared of people trying to buy it and not
[35:26.150 --> 35:32.330]  being able to? No. The biggest fear is that the fucking store doesn't work and that nobody can
[35:32.330 --> 35:37.070]  buy anything and it crashes. That's my biggest fear. That's the worst case scenario is that
[35:37.070 --> 35:42.990]  we sell zero GERBlers out of 4,000. What's great is as we have flexibility as a small company,
[35:43.050 --> 35:46.730]  obviously it's tough for us to get larger inventories, it's expensive and all that,
[35:46.730 --> 35:53.270]  but we have the flexibility to adjust and make sure that our audience in the community is aware
[35:53.270 --> 35:58.510]  of what is happening and we can accommodate them to the best of our ability. I'm confident in our
[35:58.510 --> 36:04.230]  ability to adapt to whatever the situation is. What I want is for it to be the most positive
[36:04.230 --> 36:09.890]  experience for our audience that it can possibly be. And whatever the hurdles or things are that
[36:09.890 --> 36:14.290]  come up that we need to navigate, I'm sure we will be able to navigate them and communicate
[36:14.290 --> 36:19.130]  those clearly because that is the advantage of being a small company. Where was this guy back
[36:19.130 --> 36:27.050]  in the Twinkies conversation? This should make you reflect on your Twinkies take. It does not. It
[36:27.450 --> 36:30.850]  makes me reflect on my Twinkies take and be like, man, I was even righter than I thought.
[36:31.850 --> 36:35.830]  It's apparently a bath bomb, the Twinkie. I was looking at it, trying to see if I could get it.
[36:35.850 --> 36:39.070]  I don't think I want that. See, I'm with you on that as a bath... no, I don't want that.
[36:39.470 --> 36:43.690]  You don't. You don't want a Twinkie bath bomb. Have you seen the Kraft dinner gummies?
[36:43.690 --> 36:47.830]  That to me is what I think of, of like... Did we eat those, Nick?
[36:49.650 --> 36:54.410]  I don't think so. We didn't we didn't have those for 100% Eat for FaceTime. I'll post a photo.
[36:54.410 --> 36:59.570]  They look like the... it's... yeah, it's these. I'm pretty sure we... I'm pretty sure we've
[36:59.570 --> 37:04.070]  eaten these. They're gummies that look like mac and cheese. Oh, maybe. Yeah, they're gross.
[37:04.590 --> 37:09.990]  Do they taste like mac and cheese? That's what I assume. Not... not really. I don't remember
[37:09.990 --> 37:15.010]  them tasting like mac and cheese, like at all. Hmm. Yeah, I think they just kind of suck. They
[37:15.010 --> 37:19.710]  were like powdery. OK, well, if they don't taste like cheese, I'm less against it. I thought they're
[37:19.710 --> 37:24.650]  trying to do like a cheese thing. And it sounds terrible. No. OK, now I remember. They aren't
[37:24.650 --> 37:29.050]  cheese. They taste like they... they're like gummies. Oh, that's gross. They're like fruit
[37:29.050 --> 37:37.750]  flavor. Yeah. What's everyone doing? Turn that into a bath bomb. Yeah. Could that be a bowl of
[37:37.750 --> 37:41.670]  fruit, mac and cheese, gummies, bath bomb? Like how iterative could you get?
[37:43.550 --> 37:48.030]  Probably isn't exactly that iterative. And if we could pivot for a quick second so I
[37:48.030 --> 37:50.870]  could talk about this. Please do. Something we haven't talked about publicly yet,
[37:51.510 --> 37:57.750]  but very exciting. In December, we're doing advent calendar content that I've been working on
[37:57.750 --> 38:04.450]  since October. And let me to explain further into exactly what we're doing. This is like my
[38:04.450 --> 38:09.410]  favorite time of year. I love it so much. It's the first time that we're independent at Christmas
[38:09.410 --> 38:14.950]  time. And I love you guys. And I wanted to do something to both kind of celebrate all of you,
[38:15.390 --> 38:19.690]  as well as us trying to think of like, what is a thank you that I could come up with for the
[38:19.690 --> 38:23.790]  community and that they would get rewarded in some way for allowing us to continue to do this?
[38:24.250 --> 38:29.690]  And so I've been planning for the past few months, coming up with all these independent advent
[38:29.690 --> 38:34.750]  calendars and then doing them, opening them up with you guys each day from December 1st through
[38:35.550 --> 38:39.930]  24th. And so we've been filming those and those will go up on our Patreon for free. You can get
[38:39.930 --> 38:44.350]  a free membership to our Patreon. Like there's a free tier. And as long as you have a membership
[38:44.350 --> 38:50.430]  to it, you'll be able to watch these each days. It's us opening things. I've catered each advent
[38:50.430 --> 38:55.990]  calendar to your guys's interests. So Nick and I are doing hot sauces. Jeff and I are doing card
[38:55.990 --> 39:01.110]  openings. So it's like a little mini break show. And it turns into a not so mini break show on a
[39:01.110 --> 39:06.310]  couple of the episodes. They go long, some of them. Eric and I have been doing blind box snoopies
[39:06.310 --> 39:12.250]  and Gavin and I have been doing candy and like drinks from Europe and Canada, largely Canada,
[39:12.290 --> 39:18.770]  so far from what we've recorded. But Gavin, not a sweets guy at all. And the slogans that Gavin
[39:18.770 --> 39:23.570]  has been coming up with for these products is so funny. Of it's stuff, I don't remember the
[39:23.570 --> 39:31.010]  specifics of it's stuff like, why bother? I think of like the descriptor of like root beer. What's
[39:31.010 --> 39:36.390]  the purpose? I gave a root beer to try that was a Canadian exclusive thing and his slogan for it
[39:36.390 --> 39:40.910]  was why bother with any of this stuff? You know, why bother would make a pretty good sign. It would.
[39:41.510 --> 39:48.490]  What would you put it on? According to you, root beer. Any sugary drink, why bother?
[39:49.490 --> 39:51.990]  It just doesn't have the price on it. The store just says why.
[39:54.490 --> 40:01.270]  Hot sauces have been an experience with Nick because I have a low heat tolerance. I'm not
[40:01.270 --> 40:06.930]  someone who has hot sauce. And we've been recording these in bulk recordings so that
[40:06.930 --> 40:10.750]  they can get done ahead of time so that they can release each day because it's a lot of work.
[40:10.930 --> 40:16.430]  And also it's holiday time. So people are busy. And so Nick and I did, I think, 12 hot sauces
[40:16.430 --> 40:22.210]  in a row of different types. And it was a it was a journey. It was a struggle.
[40:25.510 --> 40:31.050]  Having to reset for each day. There's some hot, hot sauces. There's some sauces that got Nick,
[40:31.330 --> 40:38.310]  which surprised me. Oh, really? Yeah, there were a couple that after a while I was like,
[40:38.330 --> 40:42.930]  oh, it's getting hotter. Oh, oh, oh. And even then it's just me like swearing in the background
[40:42.930 --> 40:50.650]  like, oh, shit. Oh, no. And then and then Andrew. Dying. Andrew. Yeah. Dying. Absolutely dying.
[40:51.510 --> 40:56.870]  Trying to drink water. Nick trying to, like, coach me through how to deal with the spice
[40:56.870 --> 41:02.470]  and strategies for it. Hold the water. Did you have a milk? Yeah, I didn't have any milk. I
[41:02.470 --> 41:06.770]  should have. I was like, I should have got cream of some kind. We had Craig recording
[41:06.770 --> 41:12.430]  the entire time. So maybe we'll release that as a bonus at some point of the unedited things of
[41:12.430 --> 41:18.010]  just the like seven minutes between certain days of me going, oh, my God, I can't. I need to just
[41:18.010 --> 41:23.770]  sit here for a minute. And you could tell which days were especially bad because I was naming each
[41:23.770 --> 41:29.890]  file and some of the naming conventions just out the window on certain days. It just would shift,
[41:29.890 --> 41:35.190]  but it was brutal. I'm glad I asked Nick. You're doing fine. It didn't impact you at all later.
[41:35.610 --> 41:42.370]  No, I was I was totally fine. And then went and had 100 percent eat some additional food. You're
[41:42.370 --> 41:47.310]  I think so. Maybe a little different. So did you guys finish or do you have more to do? Oh,
[41:47.330 --> 41:51.710]  we have. Oh, way more. Yeah, we've got like 12. So it could get worse. Oh, it could get so much
[41:51.710 --> 41:58.550]  worse. Interesting. Yeah. Interesting. And there is a lot of extremely hot. Is it an escalating thing
[41:58.550 --> 42:06.830]  like each one? No, it's not. Yeah, it is. Totally. Yeah. Totally random. And Nick kept Nick kept
[42:06.830 --> 42:10.970]  getting his nose in the sauce. He did it like three times in a row.
[42:11.690 --> 42:16.710]  I kept smelling the bar. I was just like, I was going to get a nice whiff of this,
[42:17.030 --> 42:20.290]  but I would be like, I can't smell it. So I go a little closer. I just rub a little bit
[42:20.290 --> 42:24.050]  of the sauce into my nostrils. It's like spatial awareness of your own body. Pretty
[42:24.050 --> 42:27.970]  shoddy. Do you like walk into door frames a lot and stuff? You know what? Now that you
[42:27.970 --> 42:34.850]  mentioned it, I think I do. Yeah. So that would like even us out a little bit where I would be
[42:34.850 --> 42:40.590]  impacted purely by the sauce in my mouth and Nick would be like, my fucking nose. My nose is so bad.
[42:41.770 --> 42:47.810]  The heat. I'm so excited for these to come out. They've been a lot of fun to make with all of
[42:47.810 --> 42:52.770]  you guys, and I hope the audience really likes them. Me too. I needed a fucking nap after
[42:52.770 --> 42:58.490]  yesterday. We did all of mine at once because I was going I'm going out of town. And that was
[42:59.150 --> 43:05.870]  about four hours, Andrew and I recorded. Yeah, we did 23 because we did the first one all as
[43:05.870 --> 43:10.430]  a big group. And I want to do the last one as a big group. So you figure everyone's 10 minutes
[43:10.430 --> 43:15.750]  or so for for us. It's good, though. I'm excited. I had a lot of fun. Me and Andrew
[43:16.290 --> 43:22.850]  flew through mine. We did 12 in one like today in one sitting and it was an hour. Yeah, it was 90
[43:22.850 --> 43:28.010]  ish minutes, I would say. Yeah, we did. But but the first 20 minutes of us before we went was
[43:28.010 --> 43:31.650]  just us talking shit. And then we went, oh, right, we got to record this thing. We just started
[43:31.650 --> 43:36.510]  talking about like, oh, you see this MMA thing? It was just that for 20 minutes before we got
[43:36.510 --> 43:41.110]  started. It was great. I had so much fun opening these things. It was a blast. These this is this
[43:41.110 --> 43:44.810]  is super, super fun. It's been really cool. Where's it releasing on the on the old Patreon?
[43:45.230 --> 43:49.450]  On the Patreon, December 1st will be the first one. And then there will be a new one every single

[45:24.610 --> 45:28.910]  I wonder what that says about your friendship if you were just out of nowhere gonna gift
[45:30.030 --> 45:34.150]  our Patreon to someone. I assume it'd be to someone that you know already listens to it.
[45:34.590 --> 45:38.650]  But if you just got, if you just went blind for someone, what would that say about your friendship?
[45:38.930 --> 45:42.410]  Do you think it's somebody you're trying to take that friendship to another level?
[45:43.830 --> 45:48.210]  You know what I mean? To regulation friendship? Yeah, you're trying to get real with it. Yeah,
[45:48.210 --> 45:52.190]  you got to try to have them upgrade. Be like, we're going to be better friends than ever,
[45:52.210 --> 45:54.370]  so you want to check out these Gears of War videos.
[45:57.650 --> 46:01.990]  I think I've got Gears withdrawals. I've been playing by myself multiplayer online.
[46:02.650 --> 46:05.570]  Yeah, Andrew's Andrew's been saying the horde mode is amazing. It's five player.
[46:05.570 --> 46:09.010]  Horde mode is so much fun. One person gets to be Jack Dibbs and then you just fucking,
[46:09.130 --> 46:12.610]  we definitely should film in it. I would love to. I'm doing versus, I'm doing horde,
[46:12.710 --> 46:17.350]  I'm just having a blast. Since the game's been out for a while, you know, we we didn't really
[46:17.350 --> 46:22.450]  notice the impact and campaign, but you get they give you a free boost, just like a double XP boost.
[46:22.710 --> 46:27.130]  And there's like a times four boost on each playlist. So the numbers are just constantly
[46:27.130 --> 46:31.950]  going up. And it's just great. It feels good. Feels really good spot. I remember they would
[46:31.950 --> 46:36.270]  do that at the end of like Gears two and three, kind of at the end of their life cycles. When
[46:36.270 --> 46:43.230]  people were clamoring to get achievements, it would be like 17 X times XP weekend. And you'd
[46:43.230 --> 46:48.370]  be like fucking just blowing through. Yeah. Well, there is two seriously achievements for
[46:48.370 --> 46:52.630]  Gears five, and I'm like 50 percent of the way through one of them because of sound.
[46:52.790 --> 46:57.350]  They seem impossible, though. It's like a whole checklist of shit. They do. But I'm halfway
[46:57.350 --> 47:02.830]  there. And it feels attainable. I honestly think the toughest part was the campaign for both of
[47:02.830 --> 47:07.910]  them. And we've done that. So I'm I'm currently doing a thing where I've decided to unlock all
[47:07.910 --> 47:11.270]  the weapon skins on Call of Duty, which is something Jeremy used to always do. And it
[47:11.270 --> 47:15.070]  always seemed impossible to me because I suck at Call of Duty. But it's not. It's really not that
[47:15.070 --> 47:19.290]  hard at all. I'm on like my fourth golden gun right now. I'm just trying to get diamond. It's
[47:19.290 --> 47:23.890]  really it's way easier than you'd think. That's cool. Are you into the blueprints or just the
[47:23.890 --> 47:27.610]  skins? Just the skins. I haven't really fucked with blueprint. Well, I have a couple, but yeah,
[47:27.610 --> 47:33.070]  mostly just skins. I got deep into the blueprints for Warzone. It's like different builds of all the
[47:33.070 --> 47:38.250]  different guns. Yeah. Like the black cells. Yeah. So that stuff's a lot of fun. I use a couple of
[47:38.250 --> 47:43.510]  those that I got from my season pass, but mostly just just trying to unlock the skins. It's tough
[47:43.510 --> 47:48.530]  to like, I'm loving all these games. There's so much to play right now, but so many of them have
[47:48.530 --> 47:53.770]  these like seasons and service like live service things. And it's just it's a lot to juggle. I'm
[47:53.770 --> 47:58.750]  still doing Halo Infinite every week, trying to keep rolling duty. Yeah, I still do the weekly
[47:58.750 --> 48:03.630]  ultimate challenge each week in Halo. I want to play. Yeah, we should play. It's really cool.
[48:04.270 --> 48:09.130]  They've added so much to that game. What? Like what? They added a new weapon recently,
[48:09.410 --> 48:15.230]  like the forge stuff that they've added over time is insane. They fixed a lot of the connection
[48:15.230 --> 48:20.830]  problems. Is there a theater mode? There is, but that hasn't worked great. And I haven't tried it
[48:20.830 --> 48:25.330]  in a long time, but it was really bad. If you can go HUDless, maybe we could make some backgrounds
[48:25.330 --> 48:30.270]  for the podcast. Oh, yeah, it would probably be great for that. Great for that, right? Yes.
[48:30.950 --> 48:36.750]  Yeah, you can do some insane stuff in Halo Infinite Forge. I submitted my first background.
[48:37.150 --> 48:44.510]  Oh, you did? Yeah, I just was flying around in Fallout. Oh, that's cool. Which one? Fallout 4.
[48:44.810 --> 48:50.630]  Like on PC? Yeah, I just did the like free cam and then just float around. Nice. Fallout 76
[48:50.630 --> 48:55.810]  would be an interesting one. Yeah, we've done a few in Fallout 76. I think I've done three or four.
[48:56.130 --> 48:59.730]  It's it's it works pretty well. I had an idea for something that I think we should do.
[49:00.510 --> 49:04.730]  We don't have to do it right now or anything, but you know, you know how sometimes we put we'll we'll
[49:04.730 --> 49:10.670]  leave them. We made the regulation sandwich. Yeah, everybody got to add an ingredient. I was
[49:10.670 --> 49:15.330]  thinking of things that would be served by each one of us adding an ingredient and the thing
[49:15.330 --> 49:23.970]  things that would be potentially five ingredients. And it struck me the perfect item we could make
[49:24.570 --> 49:30.750]  where each person submits one like one piece of the puzzle trail mix. We could create the
[49:30.750 --> 49:39.310]  regulation trail mix. Oh, that is great. That's so good. Good. Yeah, right. I love a good trail
[49:39.310 --> 49:44.010]  mix. Everybody loves a good trail mix. No, no, no. OK, wait, wait a second. Wait a second. Wait
[49:44.010 --> 49:51.190]  a second. Wait a second. I don't trust Gavin. This this son of a bitch is about to ask if
[49:51.190 --> 49:57.390]  Twiglets can be in this trail mix. I mean, they can. Why wouldn't Twiglets be allowed in trail mix?
[49:57.850 --> 50:01.790]  Because it's literally from the trail and we're the first trail mix where you got
[50:01.790 --> 50:06.710]  stuff from the trail for the mix. They're not real Twigs. Now it tastes like it.
[50:08.390 --> 50:12.370]  Well, what would you put in a trail mix, Gavin, if you could put one ingredient in?
[50:13.810 --> 50:18.290]  Well, I'm not just I've got to put some thought into this. What? I know. I know automatically
[50:18.290 --> 50:21.750]  what I'd put in. I know what I'd put into and you guys think I know what I would put in as well.
[50:22.090 --> 50:28.550]  I'm worried that my thing is two things. All right, here we go. This is how we're going to end the episode.
[50:28.770 --> 50:35.430]  We're going to do it in an egg order. Andrew, add your first item to the regulation trail mix.
[50:35.870 --> 50:41.670]  Have you guys ever had those like poppy seed stick things? Mm hmm. I love those. I'm putting
[50:41.670 --> 50:48.730]  What are poppy seed sticks? Let me see if I can find a photo of it. Oh, what are they? I'm trying to
[50:48.730 --> 50:53.890]  try to find a good picture. Yeah, let me see if I can find a good photo of it.
[50:54.630 --> 50:56.750]  That's maybe that's not what they're called.
[51:01.210 --> 51:07.810]  All right, we're off to a hot start. We're doing great. What are these called? I always thought
[51:07.810 --> 51:13.590]  they were called poppy seed sticks. I'm having a hard time. Nick, you can move on. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:13.690 --> 51:20.450]  It's an egg order. Yeah, we're not coming back around. Well, I submitted what it is. You told us you were
[51:20.450 --> 51:25.070]  going to find a picture. Trail mix. Maybe it's sesame. It's probably sesame. Oh, it's probably Sesame Street.
[51:25.450 --> 51:29.930]  Sesame Street. Because I'm always I always. Yeah, it is. That's what I'm talking about. I always mix those
[51:29.930 --> 51:35.050]  two things up. OK. All right, well, let's see that image. So you're so you're talking about these things.
[51:35.850 --> 51:42.070]  Yeah, those those are good. Like some some sesame sticks. So that's our base layer.
[51:43.210 --> 51:53.590]  OK, Nick, next up. The ride ship. Oh, those things are so crunchy. Somebody had to put it in. That's
[51:53.590 --> 51:59.670]  great. Had to do it. Those are those are good. I think they're too crunchy, but that's just me.
[51:59.670 --> 52:06.010]  You know, we're getting a little bit of everything. My addition, like immediately. I'm not going sweet.
[52:06.130 --> 52:12.090]  I'm going savory. Still pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin roasted pumpkin seeds are so good, even by the
[52:12.090 --> 52:18.010]  handful. Oh, oh, they're good. I think that's a fucking awesome choice. And I'm at a crossroads
[52:18.010 --> 52:26.290]  here, boys. I'm I have I have an item in mind that is honestly my favorite part of trail mix. And I
[52:26.290 --> 52:29.830]  think people aren't going to like it. I don't want to tang. I don't want to gather in our trail mix.
[52:29.950 --> 52:34.950]  So I'm going to ask you guys, is it offensive? Because I have a backup that I'm happy with.
[52:35.010 --> 52:41.290]  Is it offensive to put raisins in? No, no, no, no. Please. We need raisins and healthy,
[52:41.290 --> 52:47.330]  healthy, sweet. We don't buy anything sweet in here. Yeah. Raisin is great. I love it. I was
[52:47.330 --> 52:50.710]  hoping that you were going to go sweet because I knew you were going to go fruit sweet. If you did
[52:50.710 --> 52:54.570]  it, it was going to be like dried cranberries or something like that. I'm thinking I'm thinking
[52:54.570 --> 52:59.870]  maybe even golden raisins. But yeah, anyway. Hey, hey, drop a picture of it in here. So we
[52:59.870 --> 53:04.130]  got some good pics. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll do that. Our social. This is this is good. Gavin,
[53:04.150 --> 53:08.970]  how do you feel about raisins in a trail mix? I hate raisins in any format, I think.
[53:10.230 --> 53:16.470]  Is that you hate raisins? Why? What do you mean? What if they're Californian raisins? Hey,
[53:16.570 --> 53:24.350]  hey, let me ask. Do you like grapes? I love grapes. You like raisins? Yeah. People like
[53:24.350 --> 53:31.570]  grapes, but people don't like raisins. Is this a is this a bit grape? What do you mean?
[53:32.630 --> 53:38.890]  Well, I thought everyone hates raisins. No, no, I like raisins. I mean, I put it in the
[53:38.890 --> 53:42.690]  fucking trail mix. I clearly love them. I think we should have ordered 5000 raisins.
[53:42.690 --> 54:01.790]  I bet 5000 raisins would be so disappointing to look at. It would be a huge amount. It would
[54:01.790 --> 54:06.370]  just be a really annoying amount. It wouldn't look impressive. What's the least impressive?
[54:06.590 --> 54:09.590]  We should do another list of that right now. We don't want to get too sidetracked,
[54:09.590 --> 54:13.610]  but we should do a least impressive to most impressive item of 5000.
[54:14.390 --> 54:20.510]  That's pretty good. 5000 shacks would be quite the same. 5000 bowling balls is pretty insane.
[54:20.990 --> 54:23.510]  5000 beanbags would be the funnest room in the world.
[54:24.970 --> 54:32.030]  Well, Gavin, we've locked in so far sesame seed sticks, rye chips, pumpkin seeds,
[54:32.110 --> 54:36.150]  and golden raisins. What are you doing to round out our regulation trail mix?
[54:36.150 --> 54:39.630]  Didn't someone say that raisins were like the shittiest trick or treat?
[54:40.250 --> 54:43.750]  Didn't we just have a whole... Yeah, but that's a different scenario. Do you think
[54:43.750 --> 54:48.150]  what we're doing is candy? This is trail mix, man. It's not candy. This is trail mix.
[54:48.730 --> 54:53.190]  If you go into an ice cream shop, Gavin, and they give you a turkey sandwich,
[54:53.470 --> 54:56.970]  that's a terrible experience. That doesn't mean you don't like turkey sandwiches.
[54:57.350 --> 55:06.210]  Huh. What do you mean though? Trail mix isn't candy, asshole. That's what he's saying.
[55:07.490 --> 55:13.050]  It's a healthy snack when you're hiking. It can't be candy. There's gonna be some candy in it. But
[55:13.050 --> 55:18.770]  yeah, it's not. It's not Hershey's trail mix. Like you call an Uber and they give you a box
[55:18.770 --> 55:25.490]  of spiders and you go, I mean, yeah, you know, it is what it is. What are you... I can't believe
[55:25.490 --> 55:30.310]  you don't like raisins that much. That's crazy. What are you adding as their final thing? Well,
[55:30.330 --> 55:35.930]  I was hoping to add something a bit sweet to all this stuff before the raisins landed in.
[55:35.990 --> 55:41.850]  Well, that's fine. You still can. Yeah. But sometimes I feel like I've had some trail
[55:41.850 --> 55:46.430]  mixes where occasionally there's like a peanut M&M or something weird in there. The ratio's low.
[55:46.630 --> 55:50.210]  They're pretty rare within the mix. And I'm not going to do those, but I am going to do some
[55:50.210 --> 55:55.670]  chalky almonds because I think they're very nice. And if they were sparsely distributed through the
[55:55.670 --> 56:00.570]  mix, it'd be pretty satisfying. Okay. I don't know that I've ever had them with chocolate almonds.
[56:00.930 --> 56:06.750]  Yeah, I don't think I've ever had a trail mix. This fucking guy loves chocolate almonds. And I
[56:06.750 --> 56:10.470]  gotta be honest with you. I didn't see it coming, but I should have because he never stops talking
[56:10.470 --> 56:17.350]  about how much he likes them. However, I like it, Gav. I do like it, Gav, because peanuts were my
[56:17.350 --> 56:22.510]  backup and almonds are close to peanuts and you add the chocolate and the nut. It feels weird that
[56:22.510 --> 56:28.350]  we don't have a nut. We'd have a seed, I guess. I'm for your chocolate almonds. Oh, thanks. Yeah.
[56:29.210 --> 56:33.830]  I'm trying to think if I've had, like, I guess, would it be dark chocolate or milk chocolate?
[56:34.130 --> 56:37.530]  Does it matter? Dark, dark, dark. I usually go dark. All right. All right. Let's calm down,
[56:37.630 --> 56:42.210]  Nick. Jesus Christ. I don't even like dark chocolate, but I feel like it's got to be
[56:42.210 --> 56:46.550]  dark chocolate with an almond. I feel like it contrasts the nut pretty well and you can eat
[56:46.550 --> 56:55.070]  them and not feel as sickly about it. Yeah. You're getting 100% of this. You're fucking
[56:55.610 --> 57:00.690]  screeching and shit about specific stuff. Okay. I have a question overall, though.
[57:00.990 --> 57:05.650]  Yeah. Okay. Isn't this just regulators? What we're doing? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.
[57:05.870 --> 57:09.230]  Regulators, the thing you can check out on patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[57:09.710 --> 57:15.870]  Oh, so we did a little preview. Yeah. Of regulators. So this is now regulation trail mix.
[57:15.870 --> 57:19.490]  I think it is. Yeah, you're right. Here's the thing. I wanted to get another opinion.
[57:21.650 --> 57:28.470]  Texted Gracie. What would you add? She added rye chips. So we have a lot of rye chips.
[57:28.730 --> 57:31.930]  Well, she can't pick something that's already been added. She has to pick something else.
[57:32.210 --> 57:39.190]  You gotta do something else. She's gotta pick a pretzel or a fucking M&M or
[57:39.970 --> 57:45.270]  one of those like semi-sweet little Hershey's Kisses that you cook with or whatever the fuck.
[57:45.270 --> 57:50.790]  All right. I told her if it wasn't that, what would you pick? Also, she told us the other day
[57:50.790 --> 57:55.510]  that she's allergic to rye and then she picked rye chips and then immediately went, oh, I don't
[57:55.510 --> 58:03.530]  know. Maybe I'm allergic to these. Oh my God, she did say that. She just really likes rye chips.
[58:06.690 --> 58:11.750]  Worth it. Really, really something crazy. But yes, this is kind of what regulators
[58:11.750 --> 58:15.470]  is. We're finding like the regulation version of things. It's pretty good.
[58:15.750 --> 58:19.210]  It's funny. I'm scrolling through. I was like, let me look at all the photos of our trail mix.
[58:19.350 --> 58:24.310]  And it's the almonds and the raisins, the pumpkin seeds, and then all of a sudden fruit flavor craft
[58:24.310 --> 58:29.930]  dinner gummies. Like it blends right in. What a shit trail mix that would be.
[58:31.710 --> 58:36.990]  I like this a lot. I love a good trail mix. I'll be honest. I forgot about regulators as a show.
[58:37.110 --> 58:41.630]  Otherwise, I would have earmarked her for that. So going forward, we'll just do these there.
[58:41.750 --> 58:48.030]  But we played it off. Like what a great preview of this show. It works. It's fine. That's okay.
[58:48.610 --> 58:52.870]  Nick's going to cut out the stuff I just said. So we're good. No, he's not. I told
[58:52.870 --> 58:56.510]  Gracie she has to pick something else because Nick picked it and she just said, damn it.
[58:58.170 --> 59:04.450]  Add it to the mix. So I guess find out later what Gracie would pick. But we should probably
[59:04.450 --> 59:09.110]  wrap this episode up. Is there any food called Dammit's? There should be. Let's look up.
[59:10.010 --> 59:16.750]  Dammit's. Dammit food. Does that be a great name for our trail mix? Dammit food.
[59:18.410 --> 59:24.410]  No, I don't think there's a Dammit's. Whoa. Whoa. I imagine just buying a bag
[59:24.410 --> 59:28.470]  of Dammit's from the store. It sounds great. I might have. I might have found something. Hang on.
[59:30.270 --> 59:34.790]  I found a Flickr account, but I can't access it. So I have to send you a clip of this. Oh,
[59:34.790 --> 59:40.710]  can you grab some cinnamon Dammit's when you're at HGTV? I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[59:43.910 --> 59:47.670]  Dammit's. I try clicking on this thing and it's like, oh, this Flickr account's gone.
[59:47.950 --> 59:53.870]  So Dammit's is a specific type of food? No, I don't know. It looks like a chocolate
[59:54.870 --> 01:00:00.210]  dozzled cornbread or something. Chocolate. Looks like a choccy top.
[01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:04.630]  Oh, please just give me the damn recipe is the first response.
[01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:10.050]  That's funny. Yeah, I don't see anything. I don't see any recipes for Dammit's.
[01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:17.450]  Gracie has made another pick. Oh, she picked. I don't even know. She just sent me a picture and
[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:22.390]  said whatever this is called. And it's those little bread twists. I don't know what they're called.
[01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:27.990]  Bread twists? They're like Chex mix things.
[01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:37.290]  I'm trying to think of like how to even describe them, like what they're called.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:46.790]  Maybe like trail mix bread twists? I mean, I definitely searched exactly that. I will drop
[01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:56.470]  a photo into the discord because it was not as easy. Is it like the grain, like the whole grain
[01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:03.570]  type thing, the grain crosses? It's those. Oh, those. Oh, yeah. Immediately you knew what they
[01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:10.170]  are. It's just that I don't don't know what they're called. Utz. What? Aren't they Utz's?
[01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:15.150]  Oh, Jeff knows a little about Utz. Does Utz sell those? I do know about Utz.
[01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:18.850]  When I got ucked in that fucking alphabet.
[01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.650]  That's very similar shapewise to Andrew's pics. That'll be interesting.
[01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:33.330]  Oh, they're like little pretzels is what they are. These are these. Yeah. Yeah. They're the
[01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:42.110]  twists. Yeah. I looked at Twisted Bread and it was not helpful. Just some twisted loaves.
[01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:44.470]  I'm afraid that might be overpowering in the mix.
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:55.390]  It's so twisted to the Joker. That's regular bread. Oh, I'm I'm having a hard time imagining
[01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:58.910]  this as a mix. I kind of want to buy each item and just mix them up and put them in a
[01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:01.950]  we're going to have transparent bag just to see if it looks good as a mix.
[01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:06.810]  The next time we're together, we're going to have to eat the first regulation trail mix together.
[01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:12.750]  I love that idea. But Gavin just described buying any trail mix. I don't understand what he meant
[01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:16.550]  by that. What do you mean? I don't think he does either. What? How do you buy trail? You buy
[01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:21.370]  each part and then you put it in one bag. You buy each part and put it in one bag.
[01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:26.810]  Yeah. Like you go to a grocery store if you're making your own trail mix and they sell each
[01:02:26.810 --> 01:02:31.830]  thing individually. I've never made my own trail mix. Clearly. You just did today. Yeah.
[01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:35.350]  What I don't understand is you said it like it was a weird thing. You're like,
[01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:39.570]  I'm going to buy each part of these and then put them in one bag and just see how it looks.
[01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:46.110]  I've never done that. But that's what trail mix is. I've bought trail mix in like a bag of all of
[01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:52.030]  it. Okay. Nevermind. Nevermind. I don't go into the factory and pre-mix. I've just bought the
[01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:57.390]  finished product. Even if you buy it pre-bought, that's what trail mix is. It's all the items put
[01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:10.020]  together in one thing. Yeah. You're saying my point. What are you saying? Thanks so much for

[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  like making your own pizza and putting your own pepperoni on it. Be like, I got to see how this
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.760]  looks. I don't know. This is going to be crazy. Hey audience, let us know if you want to buy a
