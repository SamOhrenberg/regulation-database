[00:00.000 --> 00:07.280]  Introducing the new Volvo XC90 with seven-seat versatility, Google built-in and advanced safety
[00:07.280 --> 00:12.760]  features for all your precious cargo. The new Volvo XC90, designed for life. Visit
[00:12.760 --> 00:18.320]  volvocars.com.us to learn more. Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:18.620 --> 00:26.340]  This is number 58. I'm Jeff, got Eric, Andrew, Nick, and Eric here with me as well,
[00:26.740 --> 00:35.900]  boys. Did I say Eric twice? Hey, a guy like me likes hearing his name, so just say it four times, man.
[00:38.540 --> 00:44.240]  Happy to be here and happy to be here. Okay, what if we do this? What if we do this? Eric,
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.580]  at the end of this recording, you take my audio file and you re-record everything I said. Yeah.
[00:49.720 --> 00:52.700]  And then there'll be two Erics in the episode and people have to figure out who was who.
[00:53.060 --> 00:56.180]  Yeah, I think they would know right away just from this conversation.
[00:56.620 --> 01:01.600]  Yeah, it's probably short circuits. You just said, hey, Eric, do this.
[01:02.280 --> 01:05.060]  Oh, I would love to listen to a double Eric cut and just see how it sounds.
[01:05.320 --> 01:08.980]  I think that would be the lowest listened to episode. They'd just be like, too much of this
[01:08.980 --> 01:13.840]  guy, no thanks. You know, like Captain Crunch, oops, all berries. Regulation, oops, all Erics.
[01:16.460 --> 01:21.060]  Terrible. Eric just plays every role in the podcast. An endless echo chamber of this sucks.
[01:27.300 --> 01:33.460]  Oh, Christ. Well, that was a flawless beginning to the episode. Very, very excited. Hey,
[01:33.500 --> 01:40.360]  I did something yesterday. I prepared something for you guys. I'm kind of jazzed about. I went on,
[01:40.420 --> 01:45.260]  it was my first bike ride of the year, really. And I went on a bike ride in the way I used to back
[01:45.260 --> 01:49.120]  when we would do F*** Face and I would go for a ride and I would just try to write down everything
[01:49.120 --> 01:54.220]  I saw on the bike ride and turn that into like things Jeff saw on his bike. Well, I did. I did
[01:54.220 --> 01:57.700]  that and I prepared it for you guys and I'd love to share it with you if you'd like. Please use
[01:57.700 --> 02:03.160]  your ass or someone else's. It was on my ass and I know, I know intimately because of the
[02:03.720 --> 02:07.620]  very particular pains that I have riding my bicycle long distances with my little ass.
[02:08.940 --> 02:12.600]  First thing I thought about when I was on my bike ride doing, I was just riding around Town Lake
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.000]  looking for dead bodies, as you do now on Town Lake, because there's a new one about every three
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  weeks. Haven't seen one yet, but I did see a bunch of cops milling around suspiciously. So
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.460]  who knows? But I was riding around and as I was looking at the swampy water waiting to find a
[02:26.460 --> 02:31.540]  hand or a foot floating, I got to thinking about what was the last time I saw a snake?
[02:31.900 --> 02:38.240]  And I think it was on the trail about three years ago, a snake drove and like drove, I guess drove,
[02:38.360 --> 02:43.560]  rode, walked, slithered in front of me from one side of the trail to the other. And it scared
[02:44.120 --> 02:50.240]  the holy hell out of me, of course. And I got to thinking, I'm guaranteed to see another snake
[02:50.240 --> 02:56.120]  in my lifetime, but I don't know when. So it's really kind of like that movie, It Follows.
[02:56.860 --> 03:02.900]  You know what I mean? Like every day I wake up, I'm closer to seeing my next snake. And I don't,
[03:03.020 --> 03:07.980]  I don't know when or where, so there's nothing I can do to prepare about it. But also right now
[03:07.980 --> 03:13.400]  on this planet, there is a snake somewhere or the parents of a snake somewhere who are making
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.940]  decisions that put them closer and closer to interacting and intersecting with me in my life
[03:19.940 --> 03:26.540]  at some point in the undefined future. And that thought terrifies me. But it's not a guarantee.
[03:27.260 --> 03:30.820]  Yeah, it's not. I think it's pretty guaranteed that I'm going to see a snake again in my future.
[03:31.220 --> 03:33.920]  When was the last time you saw it? You think I'm going to go the next 50 years? Like I just told
[03:33.920 --> 03:37.220]  you, dickhead, three years ago on the trail. That's how it opened. You think? No, you did just
[03:37.220 --> 03:40.600]  say that. That's how this whole started. You played GTA? Did you just say you're going to
[03:40.600 --> 03:44.960]  live for another 50 years? Oh, at least. I'm going to hit 100 for sure. Hell yeah!
[03:45.460 --> 03:49.500]  Just like spite is like a motivator and like you're just like writing it out.
[03:49.760 --> 03:55.860]  See, that's the thing. My family lives into their mid to late 90s and they do it without the spite
[03:55.860 --> 04:00.180]  that fuels me, right? Like the spite thing is, I think, unique to me and my personality and my
[04:00.180 --> 04:06.080]  family. So I feel like I might also, technology, things are advancing rapidly thanks to AI,
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.100]  I might eke out 150. Who knows? Maybe we'll get to a point where I can download my consciousness
[04:11.100 --> 04:18.100]  into some sort of computer software and I'll just be eternal. But I do think that with modern
[04:18.100 --> 04:25.980]  medicine, I'm good for 100. Maybe I'd like to top out at, I mean, I'd like to get to 150 if I could,
[04:26.100 --> 04:32.800]  but I'll be happy to hit the century mark. So I figure, you know, that's roughly 50 more years
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.340]  of life. I think about how many snakes I saw in the first 50 years, dozens and dozens, if not 100,
[04:38.340 --> 04:42.000]  right? So there'll be, there'll be some measure of snake in my future.
[04:42.380 --> 04:47.700]  And every day that I live puts me closer and closer to that snake. And I don't like that.
[04:47.920 --> 04:50.720]  That's like 2,700 more podcasts.
[04:52.340 --> 04:54.760]  I mean, assuming you guys live that long.
[04:55.200 --> 04:55.840]  That's a good point.
[04:56.020 --> 04:57.180]  You're not going to keep going without us?
[04:58.440 --> 05:02.000]  Uh, well, you know what? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Who knows? Who can say?
[05:02.180 --> 05:05.820]  Every episode of Soul All Right will just be, did I see a snake today?
[05:06.840 --> 05:10.320]  Didn't we talk about the podcast not going on if one of us dies,
[05:10.340 --> 05:12.560]  unless it's Andrew and he said, it's fine if Nick isn't here?
[05:12.980 --> 05:13.640]  Well, that's true.
[05:14.300 --> 05:15.080]  That is true.
[05:15.180 --> 05:18.780]  That's not at all what I said. That's literally the opposite of what I said.
[05:22.280 --> 05:23.860]  Nick is so malleable.
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.740]  Not that you should be thrilled, Nick. I think I said that I would kill Nick because it would
[05:27.740 --> 05:32.740]  end the show because the scenario was if one of us died, if you had to kill one of us,
[05:33.340 --> 05:36.700]  or if we had the authority to kill somebody else in the group.
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.800]  Yeah, we all wanted Nick to live.
[05:38.960 --> 05:41.160]  We all said first, Nick is most important to live.
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.260]  And Andrew said, nope, I'm going to take him out first.
[05:43.480 --> 05:44.460]  Yeah, just so it would end.
[05:45.660 --> 05:49.320]  Was that the stipulation that it would just, you would kill him and it would end?
[05:49.960 --> 05:52.000]  Well, yeah, because everyone agreed he was the most important.
[05:52.360 --> 05:55.760]  Yeah, that would be like, yeah, the death knell for the show.
[05:55.980 --> 05:58.220]  Everyone agreed he's most important, so you'd kill him.
[05:58.620 --> 05:59.500]  Yeah, that was the point.
[05:59.620 --> 06:01.180]  To end it, he said. To end it.
[06:01.180 --> 06:04.120]  Right. It was a joke. Funny joke.
[06:04.420 --> 06:07.800]  This isn't the only podcast I've ever done.
[06:07.920 --> 06:09.600]  You know, there could be masks again.
[06:10.040 --> 06:11.920]  Additional and different podcasts in the future.
[06:11.980 --> 06:13.720]  Nick, you can take the mask off.
[06:15.020 --> 06:19.200]  So, Jeff, are you saying there's potentially more than 2700 podcasts in you?
[06:19.780 --> 06:20.740]  Oh, I would hope so.
[06:22.980 --> 06:24.000]  I don't think so.
[06:24.820 --> 06:29.660]  I'll be happy if I get 27 more podcasts out of this body and this brain in this mouth.
[06:30.320 --> 06:35.720]  But anyway, so that was my first thought, was that I'm essentially living in a Snake
[06:36.660 --> 06:41.980]  Follows horror movie situation, and there's next to nothing I can do about it other than
[06:41.980 --> 06:43.440]  to move to a place with no snakes.
[06:43.540 --> 06:45.960]  But even then, people import snakes, you know?
[06:46.560 --> 06:48.080]  I've seen Final Destination.
[06:48.480 --> 06:49.400]  Weird shit happens.
[06:49.560 --> 06:52.540]  If the universe wants to put a snake in front of me, it's going to put a fucking snake in
[06:52.540 --> 06:53.600]  front of me no matter where I am.
[06:53.760 --> 06:56.980]  I could be on the International Space Station and the universe could see fit to put a snake
[06:56.980 --> 06:58.200]  in front of me if it wanted to.
[06:58.200 --> 07:02.520]  Last week, I could have said it's probably been a decade since I'd seen a snake, but
[07:02.520 --> 07:03.940]  I did see one this week.
[07:04.720 --> 07:04.800]  Really?
[07:05.160 --> 07:06.340]  Dead, obliterated snake.
[07:06.840 --> 07:06.940]  Yeah.
[07:06.940 --> 07:07.380]  Are you serious?
[07:07.860 --> 07:09.360]  Yeah, his head was all smashed up.
[07:09.660 --> 07:10.200]  Oh, thank God.
[07:10.240 --> 07:10.760]  Where was it?
[07:11.760 --> 07:13.440]  It was right outside my house.
[07:14.080 --> 07:15.700]  It was probably coming to get you.
[07:17.220 --> 07:18.020]  Someone intervened.
[07:18.400 --> 07:19.900]  Somebody saved your life.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.480]  That snake might have been... that snake might have been hired.
[07:22.600 --> 07:23.640]  It might have been a snake assassin.
[07:23.860 --> 07:27.780]  It might have been minutes away from ending your life and somebody drove over it and
[07:28.860 --> 07:29.340]  fucking...
[07:29.340 --> 07:34.640]  How would a snake get... would it come up a drain?
[07:34.940 --> 07:37.540]  Would it... what's the easiest way to get in as a snake?
[07:37.780 --> 07:38.120]  Toilet.
[07:38.560 --> 07:38.900]  Drain?
[07:39.420 --> 07:40.260]  Any hole.
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.280]  It doesn't care.
[07:42.320 --> 07:43.960]  Snake's gonna find a way in, man.
[07:44.120 --> 07:44.620]  Toilet snake.
[07:45.160 --> 07:45.440]  Yeah.
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.300]  I don't trust it.
[07:47.660 --> 07:48.800]  I don't trust a snake in space.
[07:49.000 --> 07:49.120]  Chimney.
[07:49.740 --> 07:51.500]  I've got a different animal that's got in.
[07:51.920 --> 07:52.400]  What?
[07:52.860 --> 07:57.540]  My, uh, my office bog has a ceiling full of squirrels.
[07:57.780 --> 07:58.360]  What?
[07:58.720 --> 07:59.160]  What?
[07:59.160 --> 07:59.760]  Excuse me?
[08:01.280 --> 08:05.200]  Yeah, whenever I'm shitting, I could hear him, like, eating the ceiling and, like, tearing up the
[08:05.780 --> 08:06.700]  insulation and stuff.
[08:10.280 --> 08:11.640]  Have you called anyone?
[08:12.420 --> 08:12.740]  No.
[08:13.420 --> 08:14.840]  No, I just...
[08:14.840 --> 08:15.960]  How long?
[08:16.780 --> 08:17.980]  Oh, it's been probably a month.
[08:18.340 --> 08:18.920]  I just, uh...
[08:18.920 --> 08:19.700]  Oh my god!
[08:20.020 --> 08:24.000]  I've got this habit of just throwing... throwing a tissue box at the ceiling every time I'm
[08:24.000 --> 08:25.420]  taking a dump so they shut up.
[08:25.420 --> 08:31.300]  So it's done a month's worth of damage while you've sat on your ass doing nothing to stop it?
[08:31.600 --> 08:34.260]  Yeah, honestly, I thought the fact that they're already in,
[08:34.640 --> 08:37.400]  I just assumed the damage was unfathomable.
[08:37.760 --> 08:39.780]  And they're probably all over the house.
[08:40.560 --> 08:42.720]  So rather than stop them, you do nothing?
[08:42.920 --> 08:44.500]  He's allowing them to advance.
[08:44.860 --> 08:46.300]  I threw a tissue box, I just told you.
[08:51.380 --> 08:54.380]  I can, I can send you a video of what it sounds like.
[08:54.380 --> 08:55.040]  Please.
[08:55.640 --> 08:57.440]  I don't know how I'm going to do it without nitro.
[08:58.940 --> 09:01.580]  I also don't know how I'm going to find the video,
[09:01.720 --> 09:04.660]  because my camera roll is full of blueprints pictures.
[09:09.460 --> 09:11.280]  Totally wrecked my camera roll.
[09:11.620 --> 09:15.280]  Once we get past this fascinating saga that I don't want to get off of anytime soon,
[09:15.300 --> 09:16.240]  I do have more bike stuff.
[09:16.900 --> 09:19.040]  Okay, keep going, because it'll take me ages to find this.
[09:19.360 --> 09:23.720]  Well, I just want, I think Gavin should start redecorating for his squirrel bathroom
[09:23.720 --> 09:25.300]  in those pictures that I sent.
[09:25.440 --> 09:27.420]  Just go full squirrel, welcome them.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.600]  And this is, this is there.
[09:29.700 --> 09:31.320]  And then there's one squirrel with a plunger.
[09:31.380 --> 09:31.860]  This is great.
[09:32.280 --> 09:33.580]  This is helpful.
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.080]  They're gonna, they're here to help.
[09:35.600 --> 09:37.240]  He's living reverse mousetrap.
[09:40.490 --> 09:44.590]  You should start assigning them tasks to do around the house and shores.
[09:45.090 --> 09:46.750]  Yeah, they're just really going for it.
[09:46.770 --> 09:49.990]  You can hear how violent they are with the stuff up there.
[09:50.370 --> 09:52.890]  Well, they're probably multiplying and...
[09:52.890 --> 09:53.590]  Oh my god, dude.
[09:53.590 --> 09:53.910]  Yeah.
[09:55.390 --> 09:58.330]  Are you gonna call somebody?
[09:59.350 --> 10:00.070]  Uh, yeah.
[10:00.890 --> 10:01.390]  When?
[10:02.270 --> 10:08.030]  I have a problem with people in that no one ever calls me back or emails me back if I'm like,
[10:08.330 --> 10:10.390]  hey, I need a electrician.
[10:10.570 --> 10:13.150]  I'll send an email to like three companies and no one ever replies.
[10:13.590 --> 10:14.010]  Dude.
[10:15.050 --> 10:15.570]  Dude.
[10:15.850 --> 10:19.150]  I got my dishwasher fixed this morning before we started recording.
[10:19.410 --> 10:22.650]  It has been a four month saga getting it fixed.
[10:22.650 --> 10:24.770]  Just because of getting people to return calls.
[10:24.950 --> 10:25.970]  You are not wrong, Gav.
[10:26.090 --> 10:26.810]  It is impossible.
[10:27.410 --> 10:28.530]  It's demoralizing.
[10:29.810 --> 10:35.370]  I'm just thinking about your entire rooster teeth run and none of the emails you replied to.
[10:39.570 --> 10:40.770]  Oh, awesome.
[10:41.410 --> 10:42.710]  Yeah, but these people.
[10:47.010 --> 10:48.670]  Well, karma, you know?
[10:49.710 --> 10:51.910]  I feel like we were not replying for different reasons.
[10:52.510 --> 10:54.010]  Surely these people want the business.
[11:03.490 --> 11:05.110]  God damn, that's awesome.
[11:06.850 --> 11:07.870]  Oh man.
[11:09.210 --> 11:09.990]  That's a valid point.
[11:12.130 --> 11:16.290]  I've decided on my ride yesterday morning that Austin is officially a big city.
[11:17.250 --> 11:23.410]  And you can mark it by the fact that at 7.30 in the morning, the entire city smells like hot piss.
[11:25.430 --> 11:28.630]  Everywhere I went was just people pissing.
[11:28.850 --> 11:30.970]  Drunk people piss smells.
[11:31.830 --> 11:33.390]  Unhoused people piss smells.
[11:33.630 --> 11:37.810]  Runners, you know, can't hold it and pop off the trail piss smells.
[11:38.270 --> 11:42.050]  Everywhere you go in Austin in the morning, on a humid morning, smells like piss.
[11:42.490 --> 11:44.030]  So we are officially like...
[11:44.610 --> 11:46.610]  New York City smells like hot shit and piss.
[11:46.830 --> 11:50.450]  We don't have the shit smell, but we definitely are over-indexing on piss this day.
[11:50.530 --> 11:51.890]  Which got me thinking, right?
[11:51.890 --> 11:55.990]  I noticed in a meeting, I was like, oh fuck, people have pissed here, that's a lot.
[11:56.730 --> 12:00.270]  You take it for granted that we piss in toilets now.
[12:00.830 --> 12:08.590]  But for almost the entirety of recorded human history, it must have smelled worse than Austin smelled when I was riding my bike yesterday morning.
[12:08.670 --> 12:10.330]  Because piss and shit was everywhere.
[12:10.750 --> 12:11.710]  And we weren't clean.
[12:11.950 --> 12:12.850]  And we had outhouses.
[12:13.090 --> 12:18.210]  And then you would take all your piss and shit from under your bed and the bowls that you would hold it in overnight.
[12:18.370 --> 12:21.630]  And you would throw it out the window onto the fucking street down below in the morning.
[12:21.630 --> 12:24.490]  And the canals would run with piss and shit.
[12:24.810 --> 12:28.930]  Until about 150 years ago, Earth must have smelled horrible.
[12:29.150 --> 12:35.450]  Humans must have constantly encountered the smell of acrid, stale piss everywhere they went.
[12:35.970 --> 12:36.930]  I assume it smelled like a zoo.
[12:37.530 --> 12:40.050]  Yeah. It must have, right?
[12:40.610 --> 12:43.930]  I mean, nothing was pissier than working downtown, though, in Congress.
[12:44.310 --> 12:45.830]  Some of those alleyways, jeez.
[12:45.890 --> 12:48.010]  Like, going from parking to the office.
[12:48.850 --> 12:49.990]  It's a shit obstacle course.
[12:49.990 --> 12:52.110]  Pissy alleyways are small city problems.
[12:52.230 --> 12:56.570]  It's when the piss makes its way to the main thoroughfares, that's when you know you've really hit the big time.
[12:56.890 --> 12:58.210]  Yeah. Goddamn.
[12:58.590 --> 12:59.930]  I mean, like, you're right.
[13:00.190 --> 13:02.390]  Think about, like, entire human history.
[13:02.550 --> 13:03.650]  Everything is all outdoor.
[13:03.890 --> 13:06.690]  And in, like, the last hundred years, imagine somebody came to you and they're like,
[13:06.730 --> 13:10.470]  Yeah, so that thing that's outside that you go and you fucking stink up like crazy?
[13:10.650 --> 13:13.030]  We're gonna put that, like, connected to your bedroom.
[13:13.550 --> 13:15.110]  It's gonna be inside your house now.
[13:15.210 --> 13:17.850]  And then you just go, you're gonna, what? Huh?
[13:17.850 --> 13:21.910]  Like, there's no way it made any sense the first time somebody pitched it, right?
[13:22.290 --> 13:24.410]  Yeah. It's insane.
[13:24.990 --> 13:25.810]  It's weird.
[13:26.130 --> 13:32.290]  Humanity was disgusting until about 125, 150 years ago, I'd say.
[13:32.590 --> 13:39.330]  The next observation I had is that coffee shops in Austin are multiplying like gremlins.
[13:39.670 --> 13:44.150]  There is a new coffee shop on every corner of the city every week.
[13:44.250 --> 13:45.510]  It's fucking crazy.
[13:45.510 --> 13:50.910]  We're currently either done with filming Good Morning Gustavo or between seasons, so we're not going to them all.
[13:51.230 --> 13:54.030]  But goddamn, Eric, have you noticed this or is it just me?
[13:54.410 --> 13:57.670]  No, yeah, they're everywhere a lot.
[13:58.710 --> 14:01.330]  New ones that I'd never seen before just keep popping up.
[14:01.550 --> 14:06.070]  And, like, again, this isn't a complaint. I think it's great to have more of that stuff.
[14:06.070 --> 14:12.230]  But boy, it feels like after COVID, it was like ramping up.
[14:12.410 --> 14:17.610]  And then now it's like, hey, go, go, go, go more, go, go, go.
[14:17.710 --> 14:19.710]  It's a lot. It's breakneck right now.
[14:19.910 --> 14:23.710]  I probably saw four yesterday on my bike ride that didn't exist a month ago.
[14:23.870 --> 14:28.730]  I just like, yeah, every time you turn around, it's like tattoo shops were in the 90s and early 2000s here.
[14:29.090 --> 14:34.090]  Do you think coffee shop owners have all colluded to try and keep Good Morning Gustavo going as long as possible?
[14:34.090 --> 14:38.110]  Yeah, they've tried, but we're going to break them. I swear to God.
[14:38.610 --> 14:39.450]  We'll see.
[14:42.090 --> 14:46.050]  Then I had I had two other things from the from the bike ride.
[14:46.210 --> 14:51.950]  Well, sorry, before you move on, have you considered going to these coffee shops and asking why?
[14:52.890 --> 14:53.270]  Why?
[14:53.850 --> 14:56.410]  Hi. Hi. I was just riding my bike. Why?
[14:56.890 --> 14:58.890]  Why? Why did you choose to do this?
[14:58.950 --> 15:03.050]  There there's a shop down the street. There's a shop across the street.
[15:03.050 --> 15:09.250]  Yeah. Why? I can see three coffee shops from the deck of your coffee shop. Why?
[15:09.730 --> 15:13.190]  Why? I think it's fair. I'd love to know why.
[15:13.350 --> 15:16.330]  It must be demand, right? Because they're all fucking crowded.
[15:17.190 --> 15:19.270]  Because you'll pay any amount of money for coffee.
[15:20.950 --> 15:22.030]  I think that's what it boils down to.
[15:22.630 --> 15:26.730]  I would love to ask why in different shops and see if anyone actually answers a question.
[15:27.750 --> 15:29.090]  Whether they would say why what.
[15:29.830 --> 15:31.010]  Maybe you should start doing that.
[15:31.010 --> 15:33.630]  So just walk in and say why and then just see what they say.
[15:33.990 --> 15:36.930]  I think I should I should say, can I ask you a question first?
[15:36.990 --> 15:39.590]  So they expect something. Okay. Okay.
[15:39.870 --> 15:42.490]  And they don't think I'm trying to order something.
[15:42.930 --> 15:45.790]  Okay. And then you just say and then you just say why.
[15:46.570 --> 15:46.930]  Yeah.
[15:49.370 --> 15:52.250]  Hi, can I ask you a question? Oh, wow. Are you the guy from Slow Mo Guys?
[15:52.330 --> 15:53.750]  Yeah, I'll be asking the questions around here.
[15:54.650 --> 15:58.930]  Why? And then they then they're flummoxed. I like it.
[15:58.930 --> 16:02.710]  And they go, I'm so I'm so glad you asked. We are big believers in cheese.
[16:02.870 --> 16:06.790]  So we decided to open up an artisanal cheese shop that you have walked into.
[16:07.050 --> 16:12.290]  And it's our life passion, making and selling different cheeses from the world.
[16:12.410 --> 16:13.150]  And this is why.
[16:13.710 --> 16:23.870]  I think potentially I could, as I say why, I could shrug my shoulders a little bit with my hands pointed up and maybe just like gesture around at the ceiling and walls and stuff.
[16:24.810 --> 16:25.650]  That might help.
[16:29.330 --> 16:33.090]  I just I just imagine Gavin walking like you don't have the guts.
[16:33.190 --> 16:35.750]  That's very exciting to hear. You don't have the guts.
[16:36.130 --> 16:41.370]  You don't have the fucking guts to do it. But I really love the idea of Gavin walking in and saying why.
[16:41.490 --> 16:44.730]  I'm scared to talk to anyone who I've known for less than six months.
[16:47.770 --> 16:51.450]  You're only just now sort of talking to my wife and it's mostly about the moon.
[16:51.450 --> 16:55.870]  So I just God, I would love to see this happen.
[16:56.050 --> 16:58.090]  You would have to talk about the moon and pressure.
[16:58.390 --> 17:04.330]  He's a month into getting up the courage to call about an infestation in his ceiling for Christ's sake.
[17:04.750 --> 17:07.190]  I posted the video. Do you want to listen to this video?
[17:07.550 --> 17:12.470]  If you give it just a second, I'm uploading it to Discord.
[17:12.930 --> 17:15.310]  Something that it seems like you could have done.
[17:15.630 --> 17:16.770]  I don't have nitro.
[17:17.470 --> 17:19.190]  Do I have nitro?
[17:19.950 --> 17:22.430]  Oh, hell yeah. Hey guys, check this out. I have nitro.
[17:23.130 --> 17:24.670]  Wait, why don't you just get nitro then?
[17:25.490 --> 17:27.650]  I have to wait for you to give me permission.
[17:28.550 --> 17:29.430]  Okay, get nitro.
[17:29.950 --> 17:30.170]  Okay.
[17:33.420 --> 17:34.400]  Oh my God.
[17:36.160 --> 17:36.960]  What time of day is it?
[17:44.170 --> 17:45.070]  Gavin, that's fucked.
[17:45.630 --> 17:46.450]  Oh my God!
[17:48.870 --> 17:49.470]  Shut up!
[17:50.290 --> 17:54.150]  Dude, you're bog roll whippin', dude.
[17:54.150 --> 17:58.950]  Yeah, I threw a bog roll because it's just so loud. I can't concentrate while I'm doing this.
[17:59.250 --> 18:00.330]  Shut up!
[18:00.790 --> 18:03.190]  You gotta get that fixed immediately.
[18:03.730 --> 18:06.670]  You can't let that go on. That's bad.
[18:07.590 --> 18:11.370]  I just wish anyone anywhere would return a call or email me.
[18:11.670 --> 18:13.870]  Get the squirrels out of my frickin' ceiling.
[18:14.750 --> 18:18.510]  And that's not even my main squirrel problem.
[18:18.690 --> 18:21.870]  I've got them stuffing my frickin' guys with my beard still.
[18:21.870 --> 18:24.550]  My whole grill is full of a squirrel nest.
[18:24.870 --> 18:25.550]  It's bollocks!
[18:28.710 --> 18:31.070]  Did I send you the video from my grill?
[18:31.770 --> 18:32.010]  No!
[18:32.810 --> 18:35.030]  I'll keep filling for a bit.
[18:35.210 --> 18:44.090]  You just said that your gutters are filled with your hair and now your grill is filled with squirrel stuff?
[18:44.430 --> 18:47.990]  Yeah, so the area that I shaved, I just put my beard down there.
[18:47.990 --> 18:53.310]  And then the squirrels nick my beard and put it in my rain gutters.
[18:53.750 --> 18:59.150]  So now water just spills over them onto the door frames and stuff.
[18:59.990 --> 19:01.190]  Are you sure that's not birds?
[19:02.110 --> 19:03.950]  No, I mean it's squirrels and birds.
[19:05.030 --> 19:08.210]  Wow, changing his tune. This is why they won't call you back, dude.
[19:09.970 --> 19:13.770]  Guys, so what is it? Is it squirrels or is it birds? What am I supposed to do here?
[19:13.770 --> 19:18.330]  The squirrels steal my couch cushion stuffing and mix it with my beard.
[19:18.530 --> 19:20.770]  And the birds just take the beard.
[19:21.530 --> 19:25.870]  We have the same problem with squirrels. Ripping out our cushions.
[19:26.830 --> 19:27.670]  They're little fuckers, man.
[19:27.930 --> 19:30.690]  They completely dismantled a floor mat outside.
[19:34.530 --> 19:36.730]  I think we've all been there before.
[19:37.290 --> 19:39.790]  Booking a doctor appointment can just feel so daunting.
[19:40.270 --> 19:42.490]  It can be a massive headache to just start the process.
[19:42.490 --> 19:44.190]  It can feel incredibly daunting.
[19:44.490 --> 19:47.270]  But thanks to ZocDoc, there's no reason to delay.
[19:47.710 --> 19:50.530]  They make it so easy to find a book a doctor who's right for you.

[19:55.230 --> 19:57.730]  and click to instantly book an appointment.

[20:10.570 --> 20:12.150]  The range is incredible.
[20:12.750 --> 20:18.890]  You can filter for doctors who take your insurance, are located nearby, are a good fit for any medical need you may have,

[21:24.990 --> 21:27.270]  You know me. I've tried to start my own sunglasses company.
[21:27.370 --> 21:30.570]  It has not worked. It's been sticks and leaves.
[21:30.570 --> 21:33.670]  Shady Race is a proud, independent company
[21:33.670 --> 21:37.390]  who makes sunglasses that are offering top-tier quality

[22:00.530 --> 22:03.730]  Just got back from Vegas and, baby, I was styling in my Shady Race.

[22:05.830 --> 22:07.810]  I tried making my own sunglasses again.
[22:07.950 --> 22:09.950]  Want to reiterate, harder than it looks.
[22:10.210 --> 22:12.170]  And I can't say enough how much I love Shady Race.

[22:42.850 --> 22:45.350]  Check them out, baby. Vegas, baby. Swingers. Woo!
[22:45.590 --> 22:46.310]  Baby, woo!
[22:48.490 --> 22:49.970]  They could be your killers, Jeff.
[22:51.210 --> 22:54.010]  You know, there was an update actually on the subreddit
[22:54.010 --> 22:56.530]  from a wildlife biologist who said
[22:56.530 --> 22:59.170]  Jeff's serial killer, a wildlife biologist perspective.
[22:59.950 --> 23:02.890]  They said, I think he nailed it with Raccoon.
[23:02.990 --> 23:06.290]  The first time he said he found a bird without a head, I was guessing Raccoon.
[23:06.390 --> 23:07.570]  Why? Because they're assholes.
[23:08.010 --> 23:10.630]  They're known to eat only the parts of things they kill
[23:10.630 --> 23:12.230]  and they'll kill even for fun.
[23:12.310 --> 23:14.910]  This is by bleepbloop3008.
[23:14.990 --> 23:17.010]  Oh my god. Thanks, bleepbloop.
[23:18.090 --> 23:19.630]  But how birds, you ask?
[23:19.830 --> 23:21.950]  Raccoons are nocturnal. Birds sleep at night.
[23:22.130 --> 23:23.830]  Sleeping birds are much easier to catch.
[23:23.830 --> 23:25.870]  And then they tell a story about how
[23:25.870 --> 23:28.350]  they used to catch ducks in these traps
[23:28.350 --> 23:29.970]  so that they could tag them and sometimes
[23:30.330 --> 23:31.970]  raccoons will come along and see the ducks
[23:31.970 --> 23:33.830]  trapped in the cages and they'll just go
[23:33.830 --> 23:35.190]  snap their necks for fun.
[23:35.870 --> 23:36.930]  Jesus! Oh my god.
[23:38.310 --> 23:39.890]  Yeah, and then somebody else in the comments
[23:39.890 --> 23:41.330]  was like, I'm pretty sure it's probably a cat.
[23:41.430 --> 23:43.710]  I really don't think so. None of my neighbors have cats
[23:43.710 --> 23:45.190]  and I have never seen a cat in my yard.
[23:45.270 --> 23:47.590]  I feel like if there was that much murder going on in my yard
[23:47.590 --> 23:49.810]  I would at least see the cat hanging out from time to time.
[23:50.910 --> 23:52.050]  Is that enough vamp for you, Jeff?
[23:52.050 --> 23:53.770]  Yeah, I mean, when are we showing this?
[23:53.950 --> 23:55.930]  When are we seeing your squirrel grill?
[23:57.090 --> 23:58.110]  Nitro! Come on!
[23:58.730 --> 23:59.370]  It'll take me a bit.
[23:59.870 --> 24:01.230]  He's got to scroll through blueprints.
[24:01.670 --> 24:04.630]  Yeah, drop a couple blueprints photos in here to hold us over, bud.
[24:04.650 --> 24:06.170]  He has to upload it to Eric
[24:06.170 --> 24:07.570]  so that then Eric can upload it to us.
[24:09.410 --> 24:10.490]  On the trail yesterday
[24:10.490 --> 24:12.330]  I saw something quite shocking
[24:12.330 --> 24:13.310]  if I'm being honest with you.
[24:13.710 --> 24:15.630]  On one end of the trail that I take
[24:15.630 --> 24:17.950]  it's like an 11 mile loop essentially or a 10.5 mile loop
[24:18.510 --> 24:20.190]  and on one end by the dam
[24:20.670 --> 24:22.650]  over on the far east side of Austin
[24:23.850 --> 24:25.630]  there's a lot of crazy people on the trail
[24:25.630 --> 24:26.830]  because we're a big city now
[24:26.830 --> 24:28.310]  we have big city problems
[24:28.310 --> 24:30.290]  and there's a lot of aggressive crazy people
[24:30.290 --> 24:31.890]  and so I'm always having to keep a lookout
[24:31.890 --> 24:33.770]  because a couple months ago there was a dude
[24:33.770 --> 24:36.230]  at Auditorium Shores and Zooker Park
[24:36.230 --> 24:38.170]  with a machete hacking people up
[24:38.170 --> 24:38.870]  Oh my god!
[24:39.270 --> 24:41.670]  Almost cut somebody's arm off and it was like 2 in the afternoon
[24:41.670 --> 24:43.490]  so I try to pay attention when I'm on my bike
[24:43.490 --> 24:44.670]  so I don't get macheted
[24:45.510 --> 24:47.950]  and I saw a new one. I saw a dude
[24:47.950 --> 24:49.890]  who looked like he lived on the trail
[24:49.890 --> 24:51.390]  pretty wild eyed
[24:51.740 --> 24:54.010]  and he was walking around with, never seen
[24:54.010 --> 24:55.790]  this one before, a hockey stick
[24:56.250 --> 24:57.070]  as a weapon
[24:57.070 --> 24:59.810]  and I thought, wow, this is the first time for everything
[24:59.810 --> 25:01.350]  like I never even crossed my mind
[25:01.350 --> 25:04.030]  we're not a big hockey town in Austin
[25:04.030 --> 25:06.210]  you know, but with the excessive heat
[25:06.210 --> 25:07.550]  and no ice and stuff
[25:07.550 --> 25:09.970]  and I've just never seen
[25:09.970 --> 25:11.590]  a hockey stick in the wild like that
[25:11.590 --> 25:13.750]  and I thought, wow, that's really interesting, you don't see that every day
[25:13.750 --> 25:15.770]  then an hour later
[25:15.770 --> 25:17.890]  on the exact opposite side
[25:17.890 --> 25:18.670]  of Town Lake
[25:18.670 --> 25:21.210]  over by Barton Springs
[25:21.710 --> 25:23.830]  I ran into a dude, a different
[25:23.830 --> 25:26.030]  dude, with a hockey stick
[25:26.030 --> 25:27.670]  walking the trail. What?
[25:28.410 --> 25:29.550]  I know, right?
[25:29.930 --> 25:31.870]  What is happening? Does that mean there's
[25:31.870 --> 25:33.690]  some sort of a hockey rivalry
[25:33.690 --> 25:35.810]  going on? Like one
[25:35.810 --> 25:37.810]  guy's got like, this is my side of the trail and the other guy's like
[25:37.810 --> 25:39.970]  this is my side of the trail? Or is there
[25:39.970 --> 25:41.070]  some sort of a
[25:41.770 --> 25:43.930]  like crazy person hockey league
[25:43.930 --> 25:45.870]  field hockey league that they're doing?
[25:46.010 --> 25:48.010]  Did somebody break into and
[25:48.010 --> 25:49.910]  steal a bunch of hockey equipment from an
[25:49.910 --> 25:51.790]  academy and it made its way down to the trail?
[25:51.930 --> 25:54.090]  Like, out of the blue, I've seen
[25:54.090 --> 25:55.150]  two hockey sticks
[25:55.150 --> 25:57.970]  to be used as, I assume, weapons on the
[25:57.970 --> 25:59.970]  trail on different, like, these guys were
[25:59.970 --> 26:01.290]  six miles apart.
[26:01.850 --> 26:03.930]  You think it's viral marketing for the Icebats?
[26:04.090 --> 26:05.910]  Could it be? It could be viral
[26:05.910 --> 26:07.910]  marketing for our local hockey team
[26:07.910 --> 26:09.950]  the Austin Icebats, but I don't
[26:09.950 --> 26:11.410]  think so. I think
[26:11.410 --> 26:13.350]  I think it's the weird, like, let me know
[26:13.350 --> 26:15.290]  if you guys see any people out there swinging hockey sticks
[26:15.290 --> 26:17.190]  because apparently it's a thing now. Okay.
[26:17.430 --> 26:19.390]  Alright. Eric, thank you for
[26:19.390 --> 26:21.450]  uploading Gavin's video. Dude, nope, honestly
[26:21.450 --> 26:23.290]  guy like me? No problem, I got that.
[26:24.830 --> 26:25.190]  Alright.
[26:25.490 --> 26:27.330]  This is a three and a half minute video, which I
[26:27.330 --> 26:29.290]  assume we're not watching all of. Yeah, we're in a
[26:29.290 --> 26:31.490]  grill. What are we looking at
[26:31.490 --> 26:33.450]  Gavin? I hear rattling. Oh my
[26:33.450 --> 26:34.510]  God! Oh!
[26:35.190 --> 26:37.490]  Wait, you have a camera inside your grill?
[26:38.030 --> 26:39.290]  Well, I went to grill something,
[26:39.290 --> 26:41.390]  right? And it was full of a bunch
[26:41.390 --> 26:43.310]  of twigs and sticks and my beard
[26:43.310 --> 26:44.610]  and the couch cushion.
[26:46.150 --> 26:47.370]  Scared the shit out of me.
[26:51.680 --> 26:52.780]  You don't have to watch anymore
[26:52.780 --> 26:54.400]  on that, but that's the case.
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.700]  So I thought, oh, Squirrel's done this, I'll put
[26:56.700 --> 26:58.700]  a camera in there. Can we put these on social
[26:58.700 --> 26:59.940]  media? These are very funny videos.
[27:00.320 --> 27:02.600]  What the hell? Dude, I'm about
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.720]  I jumped a minute 45 in
[27:04.720 --> 27:06.780]  Squirrel's back, looking. Oh, dude
[27:06.780 --> 27:08.500]  he's like right at the camera. Oh, dude, he's
[27:08.500 --> 27:10.600]  attacking. Oh, oh, he's attacking the camera.
[27:10.980 --> 27:12.440]  He doesn't like the camera. Oh, and then he
[27:12.440 --> 27:14.600]  puts his ass in the camera. Yeah, he's going at it.
[27:14.600 --> 27:16.520]  Dude, what the hell? Holy shit, yeah, he is
[27:16.520 --> 27:18.540]  wow! I didn't remove the stuff
[27:18.540 --> 27:20.520]  because I thought maybe he's going to put baby squirrels
[27:20.520 --> 27:22.460]  in there, but he never did. Then this was like three months
[27:22.460 --> 27:24.600]  ago. Yeah, dude, this is crazy.
[27:25.360 --> 27:26.260]  You know what you can do
[27:26.260 --> 27:27.680]  if you want to handle it real fast?
[27:28.460 --> 27:30.400]  Just pop the top open, throw some lighter fluid
[27:30.400 --> 27:31.400]  on that and light it.
[27:32.740 --> 27:34.400]  Why would I use lighter fluid when I can just
[27:34.400 --> 27:36.480]  turn the grill on? Oh, I guess it is a gas
[27:36.480 --> 27:36.680]  grill.
[27:39.740 --> 27:40.560]  I don't have a
[27:40.560 --> 27:42.320]  gas grill. I'm not a gas grill guy.
[27:42.540 --> 27:44.460]  I tied a rag around the handle just to
[27:44.460 --> 27:45.920]  remind me not to turn it on without
[27:45.920 --> 27:46.900]  throwing it out first.
[27:55.020 --> 27:57.060]  The last thing I thought of on my bike ride
[27:58.340 --> 27:58.980]  I wanted
[27:58.980 --> 28:01.060]  to ask you guys a question.
[28:01.820 --> 28:02.860]  While I was riding around
[28:02.860 --> 28:04.580]  and I was watching, it was like maybe
[28:05.080 --> 28:06.940]  7.15, 7.30 and I was downtown
[28:06.940 --> 28:08.880]  and everybody was going
[28:08.880 --> 28:11.000]  to work. They were like dudes with uncomfortable
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.500]  shoes, you know, like
[28:12.500 --> 28:14.820]  patent leather shoes with like
[28:14.820 --> 28:16.400]  thin socks and suits
[28:16.820 --> 28:18.880]  carrying briefcases and everybody's
[28:18.880 --> 28:20.700]  very smartly dressed and nobody
[28:20.700 --> 28:22.940]  looks happy and their hair is all slicked back
[28:22.940 --> 28:24.940]  or clothed or whatever and they're all going into tall
[28:24.940 --> 28:26.860]  buildings to spend all day in the
[28:26.860 --> 28:28.600]  tall buildings and I was on my bicycle
[28:28.600 --> 28:30.380]  and I got hit
[28:30.660 --> 28:32.920]  with the biggest wave of
[28:32.920 --> 28:34.980]  this nostalgic feeling
[28:34.980 --> 28:36.500]  of playing hooky, like when I was
[28:36.500 --> 28:39.020]  10 or 11 and you'd play hooky and you'd see all
[28:39.020 --> 28:41.000]  the grown-ups, you know, going about their day
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.920]  and you were like fucking free to do whatever
[28:42.920 --> 28:44.960]  you wanted to and I'm, you know, 49
[28:44.960 --> 28:46.880]  years old, obviously it's ridiculous, but
[28:46.880 --> 28:48.860]  the feeling was so palpable
[28:48.860 --> 28:50.520]  it was like I was 12 years old again.
[28:50.820 --> 28:52.920]  And I got to thinking, this is like the best
[28:52.920 --> 28:55.100]  fucking feeling in the world. The feeling
[28:55.100 --> 28:56.260]  of getting to play hooky
[28:56.720 --> 28:58.980]  which made me think two things. One, I want
[28:58.980 --> 29:00.340]  to propose something to you guys.
[29:00.860 --> 29:03.200]  I propose that one day a year
[29:03.820 --> 29:04.840]  we get to call hooky
[29:04.840 --> 29:07.260]  and then we all go do stuff
[29:07.260 --> 29:09.140]  together. We go to like a movie
[29:09.440 --> 29:11.220]  or we all get online and play video games
[29:11.220 --> 29:13.260]  that we're not recording or we go for
[29:13.260 --> 29:15.220]  a bike ride or however we want to present it
[29:15.220 --> 29:16.160]  and do it. Maybe we
[29:17.400 --> 29:19.220]  figure out a way that we're, you know, because we're not all in the same
[29:19.220 --> 29:21.180]  location that we can make it all work, but just
[29:21.180 --> 29:23.260]  one day a year we get to call hooky and we all get to play
[29:23.260 --> 29:24.680]  hooky together. I think that would be so fun.
[29:25.180 --> 29:25.740]  That's great.
[29:27.060 --> 29:29.240]  We're going to go to Six Flags today or whatever, you know.
[29:29.540 --> 29:31.260]  So we all get one hooky per year
[29:31.260 --> 29:33.160]  or something? I think it would just be one hooky
[29:33.160 --> 29:34.940]  for all of us, but
[29:34.940 --> 29:37.060]  I'm open to five hookys
[29:37.060 --> 29:39.280]  because that's five times the fun, you
[29:39.280 --> 29:39.520]  know.
[29:41.560 --> 29:43.180]  But the other thought I had
[29:43.180 --> 29:45.400]  was what are the other best feelings
[29:45.400 --> 29:47.320]  in the world? Non-sexual of course, not weird,
[29:47.680 --> 29:49.260]  but like that feeling of
[29:49.260 --> 29:51.500]  hooky was so fun and it felt so good
[29:51.500 --> 29:53.260]  and then I thought about how we celebrate
[29:53.260 --> 29:55.240]  5.01pm on a Friday
[29:55.240 --> 29:56.920]  because it's the best time of the week.
[29:57.220 --> 29:59.340]  So what are the other like best feelings
[29:59.340 --> 30:01.380]  in the world? I love the
[30:01.380 --> 30:03.260]  feeling of I'm having a very
[30:03.260 --> 30:05.280]  stressful dream about like an exam or
[30:05.280 --> 30:07.100]  some bullshit from my past
[30:07.100 --> 30:08.760]  and then I wake up and it's not real.
[30:09.240 --> 30:10.600]  Yeah, that's a good one.
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.120]  I don't even have to get up for anything.
[30:13.420 --> 30:14.520]  I don't have to go to school.
[30:15.100 --> 30:16.780]  I don't have to know algebra.
[30:19.240 --> 30:21.160]  When you have that list
[30:21.160 --> 30:23.140]  of a million small things you get done
[30:23.140 --> 30:24.500]  and you knock off like
[30:25.120 --> 30:27.160]  all of it and then you sit down
[30:27.160 --> 30:28.400]  when it's done and you go
[30:28.920 --> 30:31.300]  I don't have to think that stuff that's just been taking
[30:31.300 --> 30:33.420]  up brain space for like
[30:34.300 --> 30:35.280]  weeks. It's all
[30:35.280 --> 30:37.220]  done and I don't ever have to think about
[30:37.220 --> 30:38.900]  any of that stuff again. It's done.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.280]  It's all done. Finishing that list
[30:41.280 --> 30:43.380]  is so nice. That's a great one, Eric.
[30:43.480 --> 30:44.900]  That is a fucking great one.
[30:45.380 --> 30:47.300]  For sure. For me, similar to Gavin,
[30:48.060 --> 30:49.200]  having a dream where you're
[30:49.200 --> 30:50.620]  trying to get home and you can't
[30:51.140 --> 30:52.880]  and like it's just you're struggling
[30:52.880 --> 30:55.080]  to like get there or you're on the wrong bus
[30:55.080 --> 30:56.980]  or there's some big obstacle
[30:56.980 --> 30:58.980]  and then realizing you're in a dream
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.680]  and can just wake up and you'll be home.
[31:01.380 --> 31:02.060]  It's good.
[31:02.840 --> 31:05.340]  Wake up all cozy in the bed. Yeah. Teleport.
[31:05.680 --> 31:07.020]  Yeah. A good
[31:07.020 --> 31:07.720]  shit.
[31:09.960 --> 31:11.100]  A shit that's
[31:11.100 --> 31:13.060]  been really sitting in you and making you
[31:13.060 --> 31:14.940]  uncomfortable for a while. Blast it out.
[31:15.900 --> 31:16.400]  Hell yeah.
[31:16.620 --> 31:19.160]  Are you talking about waking up from a dream or whatever?
[31:19.320 --> 31:21.060]  When you wake up in the middle of the night,
[31:21.160 --> 31:23.180]  not like a startle whatever, you're just like
[31:23.180 --> 31:25.200]  Oh man, I gotta go do this. I gotta wake up at a certain
[31:25.200 --> 31:27.340]  time or whatever and you roll over and you look at the clock
[31:27.340 --> 31:29.300]  and it's like 3 10
[31:29.300 --> 31:31.080]  a.m. and you're like I don't have to be up
[31:31.080 --> 31:33.080]  for another 4 or 5 hours. Whatever
[31:33.080 --> 31:35.260]  it is. You just have that amount
[31:35.260 --> 31:37.300]  of time. You think you only get 30 more
[31:37.300 --> 31:39.180]  minutes of sleep. You roll over. You see the time. You're like
[31:39.180 --> 31:41.160]  I have 6 more hours to sleep. This is great.
[31:41.300 --> 31:42.960]  You roll back over. It's the best.
[31:43.600 --> 31:44.540]  That can go the other way.
[31:46.560 --> 31:47.260]  That can be a
[31:47.260 --> 31:49.200]  negative. I've had times where like I'll wake up
[31:49.200 --> 31:51.080]  and I'll feel like oh I'm awake
[31:51.080 --> 31:53.020]  and then I'll realize oh I've got 5 more hours
[31:53.020 --> 31:55.120]  to sleep or 3 more I can sleep and then
[31:55.120 --> 31:56.760]  I'll wake up more tired somehow
[31:56.760 --> 31:59.120]  on the other end of the 3 hours than I did
[31:59.120 --> 32:01.080]  when I initially woke up. Oh dude, I don't
[32:01.080 --> 32:02.020]  know what you mean. Woah.
[32:02.940 --> 32:03.880]  I get that totally.
[32:05.080 --> 32:06.360]  When I was like 13
[32:07.040 --> 32:08.980]  I got an alarm clock and
[32:08.980 --> 32:10.020]  I uh
[32:11.180 --> 32:12.800]  One night I woke up at like
[32:12.800 --> 32:15.080]  I don't know, 1 in the morning to take a piss and I thought
[32:15.080 --> 32:17.000]  it was like 4 and I saw that it was only 1
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.860]  and I was like oh my god I get like 5 extra hours of sleep
[32:18.860 --> 32:20.800]  and that next morning I felt like I'd gotten
[32:20.800 --> 32:22.980]  double sleep so I started setting
[32:22.980 --> 32:24.940]  my alarm for like 2, 1 or
[32:24.940 --> 32:27.160]  2 in the morning so that I could wake up
[32:27.160 --> 32:28.920]  see that it was 1 or 2 in the morning and then
[32:28.920 --> 32:31.080]  go back to sleep because I briefly
[32:31.080 --> 32:32.700]  thought that it would make me sleep better
[32:32.700 --> 32:35.000]  Did not. Did not. I stopped
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.980]  doing it pretty quickly but I probably did it like 4
[32:36.980 --> 32:38.920]  days in a row. Jeff, I did that for
[32:38.920 --> 32:40.660]  like 2 months. Did you really?
[32:41.240 --> 32:41.640]  Yeah!
[32:44.590 --> 32:46.530]  Are you serious? You're not talking
[32:46.530 --> 32:48.430]  about just having a new kid? You actually did that?
[32:48.430 --> 32:49.130]  Yeah.
[32:50.490 --> 32:52.110]  I set an alarm for 1am,
[32:52.350 --> 32:53.190]  got extra sleep.
[32:54.390 --> 32:56.490]  I just remember feeling so refreshed that
[32:56.490 --> 32:58.450]  day and being like, it like doubled my
[32:58.450 --> 33:00.250]  sleep somehow. I gotta try this again and then
[33:00.250 --> 33:02.530]  every day it was like, it didn't work last
[33:02.530 --> 33:04.550]  night. I don't know what I did differently. Nick calling
[33:04.550 --> 33:05.950]  it extra sleep is so crazy.
[33:06.070 --> 33:08.530]  Yeah! Well, I was thinking
[33:08.530 --> 33:10.390]  you enjoy, you know, that good night's
[33:10.390 --> 33:12.370]  sleep so much, what if you did it twice in the same night?
[33:12.450 --> 33:14.270]  Exactly. What if you did it 5 times?
[33:15.510 --> 33:16.450]  Yeah, at what point does
[33:16.450 --> 33:18.150]  it become bad sleep? You'd be hibernating.
[33:18.630 --> 33:20.410]  Well, a sleep cycle is almost like 4 hours,
[33:20.510 --> 33:22.290]  isn't it? Like a full one? I think so.
[33:22.770 --> 33:24.370]  So as long as you do 4 and 4
[33:24.370 --> 33:26.490]  it's probably the same as getting 8.
[33:27.830 --> 33:28.510]  I don't know how
[33:28.510 --> 33:30.270]  sleep works. I'm not sure anyone does. I think everyone's
[33:30.270 --> 33:31.150]  shit with sleep.
[33:32.650 --> 33:34.870]  Why do we even need to do it? It doesn't make any sense.
[33:35.330 --> 33:36.710]  Once again, my relationship
[33:36.710 --> 33:38.430]  to how I feel in the morning when I
[33:38.430 --> 33:39.410]  wake up bears no
[33:40.510 --> 33:42.410]  resemblance to what my aura ring
[33:42.410 --> 33:43.750]  tells me my sleep was like.
[33:44.130 --> 33:45.350]  Like I'm fucking exhausted.
[33:45.510 --> 33:47.790]  It's like, no dude, you had the best night of sleep of your life.
[33:47.890 --> 33:49.650]  Or I wake up and I'm like, oh, I feel fucking
[33:49.650 --> 33:51.450]  great. Nope, you don't feel great at all.
[33:51.510 --> 33:53.530]  You got a 72% sleep last night. You got a
[33:53.530 --> 33:54.690]  20% drop off, dickhead.
[33:55.050 --> 33:57.690]  Yeah, you wake up feeling refreshed. It's like, hey, what was
[33:57.690 --> 33:59.530]  going on with your heart last night? Jesus.
[34:00.270 --> 34:00.590]  Yeah.
[34:01.590 --> 34:03.530]  Gavin, if you could opt out of sleep entirely,
[34:03.650 --> 34:05.150]  would you? Oh yeah.
[34:05.850 --> 34:07.110]  Really? Big time.
[34:07.970 --> 34:09.630]  I take no
[34:09.630 --> 34:11.590]  pleasure in it. I want to teleport
[34:11.590 --> 34:12.650]  from night to morning.
[34:13.490 --> 34:14.970]  Oh man, I love it.
[34:15.670 --> 34:17.230]  The waking up is fun.
[34:18.070 --> 34:19.070]  Yeah, but I just get, I
[34:19.590 --> 34:21.630]  waste so much time trying to sleep.
[34:22.330 --> 34:23.010]  That's fair.
[34:23.470 --> 34:24.370]  That's a good point.
[34:25.450 --> 34:27.450]  I like waking up and just events
[34:27.450 --> 34:29.550]  happened in the world and just being able to see
[34:29.550 --> 34:31.610]  like, oh, what's going on? What happened? I was
[34:31.610 --> 34:33.130]  out. I wasn't present for a while.
[34:33.990 --> 34:35.510]  It is nice that when you go
[34:35.510 --> 34:37.570]  to sleep, when you wake up, you know Reddit is refreshed
[34:37.570 --> 34:38.130]  a little bit.
[34:41.590 --> 34:41.810]  Yeah.
[34:43.730 --> 34:45.050]  Are you guys going
[34:45.050 --> 34:46.330]  Le Boo Booing this weekend?
[34:47.390 --> 34:47.830]  No.
[34:49.270 --> 34:51.350]  Okay. That's a whole thing that happens
[34:51.350 --> 34:53.110]  every weekend now that I can't get Gavin to go.
[34:53.370 --> 34:55.210]  Me and his wife and Emily
[34:55.210 --> 34:57.450]  and whoever. Vanessa.
[34:57.610 --> 34:58.930]  I just, uh...
[34:58.930 --> 35:01.410]  Kristen went last weekend. Do you go every week?
[35:02.030 --> 35:03.390]  I'm going this weekend and I went last
[35:03.390 --> 35:04.190]  weekend, so I guess so.
[35:07.030 --> 35:07.610]  And it's
[35:07.610 --> 35:09.450]  just so that there's like an extra slot to buy
[35:09.450 --> 35:11.270]  something because they're limited per customer.
[35:11.370 --> 35:13.610]  To get their little monster things.
[35:13.730 --> 35:15.390]  Yeah. Purse charms or whatever
[35:15.390 --> 35:17.430]  they are. I don't know. I just don't know how
[35:17.430 --> 35:19.350]  much time I want to dedicate to the latest
[35:20.630 --> 35:21.030]  landfill
[35:21.430 --> 35:22.850]  craze. Yeah. I mean,
[35:22.990 --> 35:24.830]  zero is probably like the right amount.
[35:25.210 --> 35:27.730]  I don't know. It's fun. You're just goofing around
[35:27.730 --> 35:29.050]  and hanging out in
[35:29.050 --> 35:31.250]  the worst lines, the worst
[35:31.250 --> 35:33.390]  organized sales you've ever
[35:33.390 --> 35:35.550]  seen in your entire life. It is amazing how bad
[35:35.550 --> 35:36.650]  some people are at stuff.
[35:36.650 --> 35:38.230]  Is that your pitch?
[35:38.930 --> 35:40.610]  Did you just went like
[35:40.610 --> 35:42.630]  it's great, it's the worst lines
[35:42.630 --> 35:43.850]  you've ever been in?
[35:44.010 --> 35:46.090]  I got a free donut
[35:46.630 --> 35:48.690]  and some soda as well.
[35:48.850 --> 35:49.490]  You did get a donut.
[35:50.530 --> 35:52.350]  Pretty fancy donut. It was delicious.
[35:53.010 --> 35:54.430]  And, uh, I don't know. I just like
[35:54.430 --> 35:55.830]  hanging out with people doing stuff.
[35:56.730 --> 35:58.270]  Something different. Hanging out, but
[35:59.190 --> 36:00.550]  if I'm lining up with friends,
[36:00.630 --> 36:02.670]  I want to be excited about the thing
[36:02.670 --> 36:04.370]  I'm lining up for. Dude, but they're so
[36:04.370 --> 36:06.390]  excited, I enjoy their
[36:06.390 --> 36:07.650]  enthusiasm. You know?
[36:08.110 --> 36:09.650]  I don't get La Boo Boo.
[36:09.770 --> 36:12.330]  They're on cloud nine. They couldn't
[36:12.330 --> 36:14.290]  be happier. They race to the car to rip open
[36:14.290 --> 36:16.350]  the boxes and see what color their little
[36:16.350 --> 36:18.450]  fucking stuffed animal is. And I
[36:18.450 --> 36:20.490]  don't know. It's fun to watch them be happy
[36:20.490 --> 36:21.450]  and excited about stuff.
[36:22.110 --> 36:23.710]  I get into other people's joy.
[36:24.210 --> 36:26.370]  Yeah, that's fair. And it's only
[36:26.370 --> 36:28.410]  going to last like another two weeks before they move
[36:28.410 --> 36:30.030]  on to something else. So I just, you know,
[36:30.770 --> 36:31.710]  enjoy it while it's around.
[36:31.710 --> 36:33.370]  Yeah, I just, uh,
[36:34.170 --> 36:35.810]  standing out in the heat for ages,
[36:35.930 --> 36:36.990]  I just feel like shit.
[36:39.610 --> 36:41.850]  We did spend a lot of time making fun of you
[36:41.850 --> 36:43.170]  specifically for not doing it.
[36:44.690 --> 36:45.970]  I'm not good at that.
[36:47.490 --> 36:49.350]  If I was in control of a toy company,
[36:49.590 --> 36:51.810]  it would be a, like
[36:51.810 --> 36:53.590]  when Blockbuster could have bought
[36:53.590 --> 36:55.610]  Netflix for La Boo Boo
[36:55.610 --> 36:57.650]  with me, because I don't get it.
[36:57.710 --> 36:59.670]  Like if somebody showed me La Boo Boo, I'd be like,
[36:59.670 --> 37:01.770]  we don't need to make these. Nobody wants these.
[37:02.030 --> 37:03.630]  It's the biggest toy craze
[37:03.630 --> 37:05.290]  ever. Yeah, honestly,
[37:05.550 --> 37:07.310]  skip this one. Yeah, we
[37:07.310 --> 37:08.950]  just pass on this.
[37:09.590 --> 37:11.690]  It is one of those things that it
[37:12.410 --> 37:13.830]  connects with people in a way
[37:13.830 --> 37:15.710]  that it doesn't with me, and I can't
[37:15.710 --> 37:17.550]  quite see it. But I find
[37:17.550 --> 37:19.610]  that in itself to be kind of fascinating and
[37:19.610 --> 37:20.390]  appealing, you know?
[37:20.970 --> 37:23.530]  Yeah, that's totally fair. Like, they see something
[37:23.530 --> 37:26.070]  in that deal that I don't.
[37:26.130 --> 37:27.710]  Like, I don't think it's cute in the
[37:27.710 --> 37:29.790]  way they do, but they lose their fucking minds.
[37:29.990 --> 37:30.950]  Like, oh my god.
[37:31.650 --> 37:33.610]  Emily spends an hour a night
[37:34.070 --> 37:35.310]  when she gets home from work
[37:36.110 --> 37:37.510]  watching TikToks of Makoko.
[37:37.710 --> 37:38.830]  Whatever the fuck that is.
[37:39.830 --> 37:40.790]  It's a La Boo Boo.
[37:42.410 --> 37:43.590]  Makoko is a La Boo Boo?
[37:44.090 --> 37:45.850]  Makoko is a La Boo Boo.
[37:46.070 --> 37:46.870]  It is a La Boo Boo.
[37:47.950 --> 37:49.210]  Makoko's are elves.
[37:49.630 --> 37:51.670]  Guys, if you're listening to this, Makoko is a
[37:51.670 --> 37:53.530]  La Boo Boo. If you feel like you're having a stroke,
[37:53.610 --> 37:55.670]  you're not. Simply put, Makoko is a
[37:55.670 --> 37:57.730]  La Boo Boo. I'm pretty sure. The other one isn't
[37:57.730 --> 37:59.810]  a La Boo Boo, the one with the tail, but the Makoko
[37:59.810 --> 38:01.070]  is, even though it's got the
[38:01.570 --> 38:03.470]  heart nose, but it's
[38:03.470 --> 38:05.590]  like the princess or the
[38:06.350 --> 38:07.430]  mom or the
[38:08.170 --> 38:09.730]  fairy or something. They're little
[38:09.730 --> 38:11.790]  elves, right? And the Makoko is one
[38:11.790 --> 38:13.490]  of them, but also elevated in some way.
[38:13.550 --> 38:15.110]  I don't know. It's complicated.
[38:16.630 --> 38:17.670]  I'm going throwback
[38:17.670 --> 38:19.850]  with some collectible stuff. This comes out in July.
[38:20.650 --> 38:21.670]  Peanuts Tamagotchi Snack.
[38:21.730 --> 38:23.010]  Oh, that's so cool!
[38:24.050 --> 38:24.890]  Isn't that
[38:24.890 --> 38:27.110]  awesome? I don't care about this at all.
[38:27.230 --> 38:28.810]  I want it because the
[38:28.810 --> 38:30.850]  little NES looking graphics
[38:30.850 --> 38:32.730]  on the bottom where it's like
[38:32.730 --> 38:35.070]  Snoopy and then he's Safari Snoopy
[38:35.070 --> 38:36.950]  and Pirate Snoopy and Joe Cool and all
[38:36.950 --> 38:39.050]  that stuff. I'm like, dude, I'm dressing my Snoopy
[38:39.050 --> 38:41.070]  up. I can't wait for this thing.
[38:41.510 --> 38:43.210]  I'm bummed that Tamagotchi technology
[38:43.210 --> 38:44.690]  didn't really advance beyond its
[38:44.690 --> 38:45.990]  first few iterations.
[38:46.930 --> 38:47.970]  What do you want from it?
[38:49.210 --> 38:49.730]  Yeah.
[38:49.730 --> 38:51.590]  That looks like
[38:51.590 --> 38:52.450]  1994.
[38:52.910 --> 38:54.130]  I think that's part of the charm.
[38:54.330 --> 38:56.950]  I like the NES.
[38:57.750 --> 38:59.510]  If that was like high res
[38:59.510 --> 39:01.270]  Snoopy's, I wouldn't be as interested as
[39:01.270 --> 39:03.130]  the NES looking Snoopy's.
[39:03.310 --> 39:04.130]  You know what I mean?
[39:05.190 --> 39:07.810]  Look at that one on the way. He's wearing a little hat.
[39:08.430 --> 39:09.130]  It's pretty exciting.
[39:09.750 --> 39:11.650]  He's like the man of mystery. That's Snoopy.
[39:13.990 --> 39:15.070]  There's something about
[39:15.910 --> 39:17.430]  how simple it looks
[39:17.430 --> 39:19.210]  that taps into childhood
[39:19.210 --> 39:21.390]  for me. If it was
[39:21.390 --> 39:23.330]  cleaner or crisper, it
[39:23.330 --> 39:25.150]  wouldn't hit the same. There's something
[39:27.130 --> 39:27.610]  childish
[39:27.610 --> 39:29.130]  about the way it looks.
[39:29.450 --> 39:31.530]  I switched my
[39:31.530 --> 39:33.250]  Apple TV screensavers to Snoopy
[39:33.250 --> 39:34.450]  and I'm enjoying the
[39:34.450 --> 39:37.370]  Ultra HD Snoopy adventures
[39:37.370 --> 39:38.570]  that are happening on my telly.
[39:38.750 --> 39:41.150]  I gotta get an Apple TV just for that.
[39:41.210 --> 39:43.130]  I don't have Apple TV. I think I might have to get one
[39:43.130 --> 39:45.450]  just to watch the Snoopy screensavers and not
[39:45.450 --> 39:47.350]  subscribe to anything. Do you have a watch?
[39:47.790 --> 39:49.330]  No. I guess I should
[39:49.330 --> 39:50.990]  switch to those. Are they entertaining?
[39:51.830 --> 39:52.810]  Oh, I love them.
[39:53.430 --> 39:55.350]  He's probably getting into all kinds of trouble. He's probably
[39:55.350 --> 39:57.250]  hanging out with Woodstock. He's probably flying around
[39:57.250 --> 39:59.190]  in his doghouse. He's probably
[39:59.190 --> 40:01.410]  fighting the Red Baron dude. Snoopy's trying to have
[40:01.410 --> 40:03.390]  a little kip on his doghouse and Woodstock's
[40:03.390 --> 40:04.250]  just pissing him off.
[40:05.770 --> 40:07.290]  It's great. He's just kipping. I think at the
[40:07.290 --> 40:08.290]  end of the day though,
[40:10.390 --> 40:11.110]  you're just...
[40:11.110 --> 40:13.450]  the aesthetic of your childhood is
[40:13.450 --> 40:15.450]  forever imprinted on you, you know?
[40:15.770 --> 40:16.910]  And so it'll always
[40:17.450 --> 40:19.410]  appeal to you. But I always do
[40:19.410 --> 40:21.410]  appreciate a remaster. Like, if I'm gonna
[40:21.410 --> 40:23.510]  go back and play Halo 2 now, I'm definitely
[40:23.510 --> 40:25.530]  playing with new graphics. Well, yeah, I'm not
[40:25.530 --> 40:27.070]  playing the old Oblivion, that's for sure.
[40:29.250 --> 40:29.810]  But like,
[40:29.890 --> 40:31.190]  if the screensaver,
[40:32.110 --> 40:33.330]  the Snoopy screensaver, was
[40:33.330 --> 40:35.430]  a Tamagotchi in a way where you had to feed him
[40:35.430 --> 40:37.230]  or die or whatever, I would be into it.
[40:37.850 --> 40:39.190]  Yeah, I think they're just...
[40:39.190 --> 40:41.270]  I think playing a game like that would be fun.
[40:41.270 --> 40:43.370]  There's just the...
[40:43.370 --> 40:45.230]  nostalgia of giant head, tiny body Snoopy
[40:45.230 --> 40:47.290]  that looks like little block graphics
[40:47.290 --> 40:48.970]  that I really enjoy. But
[40:48.970 --> 40:50.970]  I think I would enjoy the Apple TV
[40:50.970 --> 40:53.250]  screensavers just as much. I gotta...
[40:53.250 --> 40:55.250]  Do I have to subscribe to anything to get that
[40:55.250 --> 40:57.030]  or can they just give it to me? No.
[40:57.410 --> 40:59.090]  But I tell you what though, we should just... I'll bring
[40:59.090 --> 41:01.190]  my Apple TV to the office and we can just put it on our telly.
[41:01.550 --> 41:03.310]  That's what I'm talking about. Hang a
[41:03.310 --> 41:05.470]  TV next to Andrew's watchful
[41:05.470 --> 41:07.330]  eye and then I can just watch Snoopy screensavers.
[41:07.470 --> 41:09.270]  We can watch that instead of reruns
[41:09.270 --> 41:11.350]  of Wipeout over and over again. Yeah, because they look
[41:11.350 --> 41:11.950]  like dog shit.
[41:12.950 --> 41:15.310]  Dude, they look BAD on
[41:15.310 --> 41:16.870]  our 90 inch TV.
[41:18.590 --> 41:19.270]  I think it's 86.
[41:19.770 --> 41:20.350]  Yeah, 86.
[41:22.630 --> 41:23.030]  What?
[41:23.770 --> 41:25.270]  Makoko? Is that what you said, Jeff?
[41:25.490 --> 41:27.130]  You're bringing up Makoko or something? Yeah.
[41:27.670 --> 41:28.750]  Yeah, I believe so.
[41:29.110 --> 41:31.270]  In Expedition 33, there's a character
[41:31.270 --> 41:33.310]  named Monaco, which
[41:33.310 --> 41:35.230]  is not Makoko, but I would absolutely buy
[41:35.230 --> 41:36.450]  a LeBoo boot if it looked like that.
[41:36.930 --> 41:38.390]  Just a weird looking
[41:38.390 --> 41:40.430]  wooden guy with a speedo. Yeah, he's got
[41:40.430 --> 41:41.630]  like a head mask thing.
[41:41.830 --> 41:44.450]  But I've been playing a lot of Expedition 33
[41:44.450 --> 41:46.450]  and I brought this up to Gavin when I
[41:46.450 --> 41:48.470]  wanted to bring it up on the podcast so we could pressure him
[41:48.470 --> 41:50.570]  into doing this. But I encountered
[41:51.550 --> 41:52.510]  the number
[41:52.510 --> 41:54.590]  one villain in Gavin's heart
[41:54.590 --> 41:55.770]  in that game.
[41:56.470 --> 41:58.330]  There is a boss. My nemesis.
[41:58.630 --> 42:00.350]  Named Chromatic
[42:00.830 --> 42:01.310]  Aberration.
[42:03.710 --> 42:04.470]  I think
[42:04.470 --> 42:06.230]  I immediately texted Gavin
[42:06.230 --> 42:08.330]  we need to make content where you cannot
[42:08.330 --> 42:10.490]  stop playing this until you defeat your
[42:10.490 --> 42:12.270]  enemy, Chromatic Aberration.
[42:12.810 --> 42:14.690]  There should be an easter egg
[42:14.690 --> 42:16.530]  in that game where if you stumble
[42:16.530 --> 42:18.350]  across this boss and you start fighting him
[42:18.350 --> 42:20.450]  and then you go to the menu and settings
[42:20.450 --> 42:22.510]  and turn off Chromatic Aberration, he should just
[42:22.510 --> 42:23.250]  vanish from the game.
[42:24.870 --> 42:25.430]  That's a great idea!
[42:26.430 --> 42:27.550]  That's so Kojima!
[42:28.610 --> 42:30.090]  That's Makoko. They look different.
[42:30.350 --> 42:31.870]  I can tell they're related.
[42:32.630 --> 42:33.670]  Honestly, Labubu
[42:33.670 --> 42:35.710]  looks like they would fit in Expedition 33.
[42:35.910 --> 42:37.730]  There's kind of a...
[42:38.290 --> 42:39.850]  weird aesthetic to it.
[42:40.650 --> 42:41.270]  They make me sick.
[42:43.810 --> 42:45.170]  I think I'm with Gavin.
[42:45.530 --> 42:46.390]  What makes you sick?
[42:46.850 --> 42:49.170]  It disgusts me.
[42:50.830 --> 42:51.910]  Chromatic Aberration?
[42:52.210 --> 42:53.010]  Or the stuffed animal?
[42:53.770 --> 42:54.810]  The Labubu.
[42:57.030 --> 42:58.050]  That's Makoko.
[42:59.310 --> 43:00.310]  That's not a Labubu?
[43:00.310 --> 43:02.090]  Well, Makoko is a Labubu.
[43:02.690 --> 43:04.530]  Makoko is a Labubu, not like Monaco.
[43:04.950 --> 43:06.310]  Monaco knows Chromatic Aberration.
[43:07.250 --> 43:08.310]  Do you know how much that one
[43:08.310 --> 43:09.570]  I just posted cost?
[43:09.890 --> 43:11.350]  It's going to make me mad.
[43:12.230 --> 43:14.610]  So, the rub
[43:15.650 --> 43:16.530]  with Makoko
[43:16.530 --> 43:18.250]  as I understand it, is that you cannot buy
[43:18.250 --> 43:19.990]  Makoko from PopMart, the store.
[43:20.390 --> 43:21.810]  You have to go to PopLand,
[43:22.270 --> 43:24.590]  the theme park in China, to get it.
[43:24.930 --> 43:26.590]  And so, on StockX and stuff,
[43:27.370 --> 43:28.310]  Makoko will run you about
[43:28.310 --> 43:29.750]  $180 to $200.
[43:31.950 --> 43:32.750]  Same size
[43:32.750 --> 43:33.770]  as the other ones, by the way.
[43:33.970 --> 43:34.150]  Little.
[43:34.670 --> 43:36.490]  You don't fancy standing in line in China?
[43:39.150 --> 43:40.290]  I do, but the
[43:40.290 --> 43:41.550]  plane ticket alone is going to be
[43:42.350 --> 43:43.670]  more than just paying the $150.
[43:43.910 --> 43:45.930]  Also, I don't want it. I just enjoy
[43:45.930 --> 43:47.190]  watching other people want it.
[43:47.970 --> 43:50.730]  Building a portfolio with Fidelity Basket Portfolios

[43:54.270 --> 43:56.090]  picking your stocks and ETFs,
[43:56.090 --> 43:57.890]  sort of like your meats and other topics,
[43:58.470 --> 43:59.790]  and managing it as one
[43:59.790 --> 44:01.290]  big, juicy investment.
[44:03.310 --> 44:03.870]  Mmm.

[44:17.290 --> 44:18.230]  This summer,
[44:18.430 --> 44:19.850]  try the new Strato Frappuccino
[44:19.850 --> 44:21.230]  blended beverage at Starbucks.
[44:21.510 --> 44:23.950]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know
[44:23.950 --> 44:25.970]  and love, now topped with a creamy layer
[44:25.970 --> 44:28.050]  of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[44:28.450 --> 44:29.950]  Available for a limited time.
[44:30.210 --> 44:32.310]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[44:32.850 --> 44:34.230]  Jeff, was Marcus Smart
[44:34.230 --> 44:34.830]  your LaBooBoo?
[44:35.530 --> 44:37.630]  Yeah, Marcus Smart's my LaBooBoo.
[44:38.470 --> 44:39.830]  Marcus, uh, Washington
[44:39.830 --> 44:41.550]  Wizard Smart is my LaBooBoo.
[44:42.210 --> 44:43.930]  I'm surprised Furby didn't
[44:43.930 --> 44:45.750]  do more collabs.
[44:46.170 --> 44:48.030]  Mmm. Why isn't there a LaBooBoo Furby?
[44:48.950 --> 44:49.750]  I think
[44:49.750 --> 44:51.750]  Furby existed in a time before
[44:51.750 --> 44:53.810]  collabs. Yeah, that's a great
[44:53.810 --> 44:55.230]  point. That's a really good point.
[44:55.870 --> 44:57.790]  He stood alone. He did. Plus, I don't
[44:57.790 --> 44:58.950]  know if Furby's big enough.
[44:59.890 --> 45:01.290]  LaBooBoo collabs with Coke.
[45:02.330 --> 45:02.610]  Really?
[45:03.450 --> 45:05.750]  Yeah, but Furby was hot shit. There was one Christmas
[45:05.750 --> 45:06.950]  where everyone was trying to get Furby.
[45:07.590 --> 45:08.690]  It's true. Yeah.
[45:09.230 --> 45:11.590]  There will be one year of everyone trying to get LaBooBoo.
[45:13.150 --> 45:13.750]  I thought
[45:13.750 --> 45:15.650]  he was holding a gun. I thought
[45:15.650 --> 45:17.370]  that that was a rifle. I did not
[45:17.370 --> 45:19.570]  immediately register as a Coca-Cola bottle.
[45:19.570 --> 45:21.490]  I thought that that was a weapon.
[45:21.490 --> 45:23.190]  That's next year's collab with Glott.
[45:28.710 --> 45:29.610]  That was it
[45:29.610 --> 45:31.510]  for my bike ride. That was quite the
[45:31.510 --> 45:32.990]  bike ride. Yeah.
[45:33.310 --> 45:35.310]  I think we should do a group bike ride to see what
[45:35.310 --> 45:37.470]  adventures we all... We should all just do a bike
[45:37.470 --> 45:39.330]  ride and then we'll all remember stuff and see if we
[45:39.330 --> 45:41.010]  remembered the same stuff from the trip. Yeah.
[45:41.190 --> 45:43.310]  And keep your eyes out for hockey sticks because
[45:43.310 --> 45:45.490]  they're out there. And dead bodies
[45:45.490 --> 45:47.470]  and snakes. And dead bodies and snakes.
[45:47.470 --> 45:49.390]  Yeah. I hope it's a long
[45:49.390 --> 45:50.850]  time before I see a snake.
[45:51.070 --> 45:53.310]  I do too for you. Have you
[45:53.310 --> 45:55.630]  seen these Spongebob LaBooBoo's?
[45:55.890 --> 45:56.110]  What?
[45:56.930 --> 45:59.670]  Wait, there's Spongebob LaBooBoo's?
[45:59.710 --> 46:01.330]  Yeah, and they look nothing like the
[46:01.330 --> 46:03.610]  LaBooBoo's. I don't understand how these are LaBooBoo's
[46:03.610 --> 46:05.490]  but these are the Spongebob LaBooBoo's. These are worse.
[46:05.850 --> 46:07.490]  These are so much worse.
[46:07.770 --> 46:08.850]  These are so much worse.
[46:09.390 --> 46:11.430]  I don't like looking
[46:11.430 --> 46:13.090]  at a single one of these things.
[46:13.430 --> 46:15.390]  This is... I don't like this at
[46:15.390 --> 46:17.270]  all. That Mr. Krabs is
[46:17.270 --> 46:18.810]  fucked up.
[46:20.070 --> 46:21.050]  Mr. Krabs in
[46:21.050 --> 46:22.990]  specific is disturbing.
[46:24.590 --> 46:24.630]  And
[46:26.530 --> 46:27.570]  yeah, Spongebob
[46:28.310 --> 46:29.110]  with the
[46:29.710 --> 46:31.330]  pumpkin is weird. Do you think
[46:31.330 --> 46:32.810]  the guy in the factory is like
[46:33.390 --> 46:35.190]  installing this injection mold
[46:35.190 --> 46:36.790]  plate and just going like
[46:37.390 --> 46:37.830]  ugh.
[46:40.810 --> 46:41.570]  Hey Gav,
[46:41.630 --> 46:43.010]  check it out, it's Cave Bob Spongebob.
[46:43.810 --> 46:44.730]  There he is.
[46:49.990 --> 46:51.190]  We should do that BMX
[46:51.190 --> 46:52.130]  track at GTA again.
[46:52.710 --> 46:54.570]  Alright, I'd love to.
[46:54.870 --> 46:55.530]  I'd absolutely love to.
[46:57.030 --> 46:58.810]  I saw a TikTok about a
[46:58.810 --> 47:01.010]  prank that I wanted to play on one of you guys
[47:01.670 --> 47:02.970]  but I've decided not to
[47:02.970 --> 47:05.130]  do it because I don't think it'd be worth the fallout
[47:05.130 --> 47:07.170]  but I would like to share the prank with you
[47:07.170 --> 47:09.170]  in case you want to play it on somebody else you know.
[47:09.470 --> 47:10.930]  Is this the thing that you said you didn't want to do
[47:10.930 --> 47:12.790]  because it would end a friendship? I thought it might.
[47:12.990 --> 47:14.390]  Yeah, I don't know how...
[47:15.610 --> 47:16.930]  Yeah, I don't know if you guys
[47:16.930 --> 47:18.850]  are cool enough to live with a prank
[47:18.850 --> 47:19.570]  like this for a long time.
[47:21.370 --> 47:22.810]  I saw a TikTok of this dude
[47:22.810 --> 47:24.870]  who said if you ever want to really screw somebody over for the rest
[47:24.870 --> 47:27.170]  of their lives, a friend of his
[47:27.590 --> 47:28.930]  about two or three years ago
[47:29.630 --> 47:30.310]  wrote his
[47:30.310 --> 47:32.470]  in Sharpie, wrote his phone number
[47:32.850 --> 47:34.470]  inside a porta potty and said
[47:34.470 --> 47:36.890]  send me pictures of your poop to this
[47:36.890 --> 47:39.170]  number. God damn it.
[47:39.170 --> 47:41.330]  And then he said for about two weeks
[47:41.330 --> 47:43.070]  he just got the most heinous
[47:43.070 --> 47:44.350]  construction worker
[47:45.230 --> 47:47.070]  blowout shits. And he
[47:47.070 --> 47:48.910]  couldn't do anything about it because each
[47:48.910 --> 47:51.230]  text is coming
[47:51.230 --> 47:54.430]  from a different number so there's no way
[47:54.430 --> 47:55.390]  to block it, right?
[47:55.790 --> 47:57.230]  But then, you know, the porta
[47:57.230 --> 47:59.010]  potty gets moved from the site
[47:59.010 --> 48:00.730]  and it goes somewhere else and he says
[48:00.730 --> 48:03.070]  the shit texts would stop
[48:03.070 --> 48:04.970]  for a while and then like three months later
[48:04.970 --> 48:07.090]  he'd get them for a month and then they'd go
[48:07.090 --> 48:09.210]  away for a while and then he would get them for like
[48:09.210 --> 48:11.090]  another month and for two years
[48:11.090 --> 48:12.970]  just every once in a while whenever that
[48:12.970 --> 48:14.990]  porta potty's in rotation somewhere, he
[48:14.990 --> 48:17.050]  just gets the worst shits known to
[48:17.050 --> 48:18.590]  man texted to him and
[48:19.630 --> 48:21.110]  you have no idea where
[48:21.110 --> 48:22.870]  the porta potty is. It's always moving, right?
[48:22.930 --> 48:24.750]  So there's no way to find it and remove it.
[48:25.050 --> 48:27.010]  So for the rest of the use of that porta
[48:27.010 --> 48:29.270]  potty, he's just doomed
[48:29.270 --> 48:30.970]  to get nasty
[48:30.970 --> 48:31.870]  shit texts.
[48:34.230 --> 48:35.170]  That's awful.
[48:37.090 --> 48:38.970]  I was on a Bacardi commercial
[48:38.970 --> 48:41.230]  once that was like five days long and the medic
[48:41.230 --> 48:43.290]  kept sending me pictures of his wife's
[48:43.290 --> 48:43.650]  shits.
[48:46.050 --> 48:47.110]  What are you
[48:47.110 --> 48:48.870]  talking about? What are you saying?
[48:49.370 --> 48:51.070]  What are you
[48:51.070 --> 48:51.930]  saying?
[48:53.110 --> 48:55.050]  His wife would text him her
[48:55.050 --> 48:57.130]  shits every day and he'd be like, uh, new one from
[48:57.130 --> 48:58.730]  the wife? And I'd be like, God.
[48:59.930 --> 49:00.590]  Damn, dude.
[49:00.690 --> 49:02.610]  I'm like aghast.
[49:02.690 --> 49:05.170]  I'm like aghast at what you just
[49:05.170 --> 49:05.670]  said, man.
[49:05.970 --> 49:09.170]  That might be one of the craziest
[49:09.770 --> 49:11.010]  things I've ever heard.
[49:11.190 --> 49:13.550]  What the fuck are you
[49:14.290 --> 49:15.010]  talking about?
[49:15.130 --> 49:16.590]  And I was like 18
[49:17.070 --> 49:19.110]  maybe I was 19. I was just like
[49:19.110 --> 49:21.070]  why does this guy like me so much?
[49:23.530 --> 49:25.250]  What? Do you think he wanted to do
[49:25.250 --> 49:27.110]  stuff with you? Nah, he
[49:27.110 --> 49:27.530]  was just
[49:28.990 --> 49:31.090]  uh, he just latched onto
[49:31.090 --> 49:33.170]  me at the beginning of the shoot. He kept talking to me and I was like
[49:33.170 --> 49:34.970]  yeah, being friendly at first
[49:34.970 --> 49:36.990]  and then the shits came in. He got real
[49:36.990 --> 49:38.510]  familiar real fast and then I was just like
[49:38.510 --> 49:41.290]  Oh my God. Did he ever stop
[49:41.290 --> 49:43.230]  or did you just have to look at those shits the entirety
[49:43.230 --> 49:45.170]  of the shoot? Oh, it was the whole shoot.
[49:46.070 --> 49:46.870]  Oh no!
[49:48.070 --> 49:49.270]  This is what I love about
[49:49.270 --> 49:50.110]  this podcast.
[49:51.050 --> 49:53.070]  I throw out a TikTok I saw that's
[49:53.070 --> 49:54.890]  a funny prank. Gavin instantly
[49:54.890 --> 49:57.090]  has a real life story that
[49:57.090 --> 49:58.650]  trumps it by a thousand.
[49:59.230 --> 50:00.130]  Insane. Yeah.
[50:00.130 --> 50:02.030]  I don't know if you've spent a lot of time
[50:02.030 --> 50:04.430]  on sets, but the medics are bored.
[50:04.590 --> 50:05.950]  They don't often do stuff.
[50:06.370 --> 50:07.910]  I mean, they're very important to have when something
[50:07.910 --> 50:09.150]  happens. Yeah.
[50:09.270 --> 50:12.070]  They are just quiddling their thumbs all
[50:12.070 --> 50:13.810]  goddamn day. They're also
[50:13.810 --> 50:16.030]  full of shit and very scared of ghosts
[50:16.030 --> 50:16.430]  apparently.
[50:17.390 --> 50:19.690]  It was the fucking medics that shut down our
[50:19.690 --> 50:21.790]  horror shoot because the lady saw an orb and it
[50:21.790 --> 50:22.730]  chased her through the woods.
[50:23.470 --> 50:25.970]  A very real thing, absolutely.
[50:26.730 --> 50:27.290]  Yeah.
[50:27.710 --> 50:30.050]  Yeah, I was a medic. Oh my god.
[50:31.150 --> 50:31.710]  Crazy.
[50:32.270 --> 50:33.930]  Crazy. Have
[50:33.930 --> 50:35.990]  you ever tried to do a prank and
[50:35.990 --> 50:37.370]  somebody around you shut it down?
[50:39.510 --> 50:40.070]  Probably
[50:40.070 --> 50:41.030]  a lot, yeah.
[50:41.470 --> 50:43.610]  Probably a lot in Achievement Hunter, but
[50:43.610 --> 50:46.190]  go on. My most recent one,
[50:46.650 --> 50:48.050]  I was talking to
[50:48.050 --> 50:50.010]  somebody about someone
[50:50.010 --> 50:51.850]  that they don't talk to anymore.
[50:52.070 --> 50:54.130]  They had a falling out. They no longer
[50:54.130 --> 50:56.030]  speak. And they
[50:56.030 --> 50:57.510]  brought them up and
[50:58.050 --> 51:00.110]  they're not dead, but I just said, oh yeah, they passed
[51:00.110 --> 51:01.470]  away recently. They're dead.
[51:02.150 --> 51:04.170]  Because I thought in my head they wouldn't know
[51:04.170 --> 51:06.330]  and they would just think that this person
[51:06.330 --> 51:07.890]  was dead, that they were just shit talking.
[51:08.130 --> 51:10.090]  And that was funny to me. And I thought
[51:10.090 --> 51:12.210]  they'd just continue on their lives thinking that this
[51:12.210 --> 51:13.570]  person was dead, who's alive.
[51:14.290 --> 51:16.190]  And my partner was there
[51:16.190 --> 51:17.970]  in the conversation and immediately
[51:17.970 --> 51:19.050]  shut it down.
[51:20.490 --> 51:22.050]  He's kidding. He's
[51:22.050 --> 51:23.530]  fine. He's not dead.
[51:23.790 --> 51:26.030]  And I was like, oh man, I really could've
[51:26.030 --> 51:27.990]  got him with that one. He definitely would've
[51:27.990 --> 51:29.910]  thought for quite a while
[51:29.910 --> 51:31.710]  until I probably told him that was a joke
[51:31.710 --> 51:33.350]  that that person was dead.
[51:37.910 --> 51:39.850]  I got a little too into
[51:39.850 --> 51:41.750]  setting people and stuff on fire
[51:41.750 --> 51:43.150]  for a while in Achievement Hunter.
[51:43.350 --> 51:46.030]  I think people interviewed me and told me to knock it off.
[51:46.490 --> 51:47.910]  Jesus. You're just
[51:47.910 --> 51:49.910]  an arson for a bit. You went through an arson
[51:49.910 --> 51:52.090]  phase. You can't be setting people's
[51:52.090 --> 51:53.850]  shoes on fire anymore. You gotta stop that.
[51:54.050 --> 51:55.830]  I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[52:02.280 --> 52:03.020]  Gavin's not laughing
[52:03.020 --> 52:04.980]  because so much of his stuff got blown up.
[52:06.580 --> 52:07.020]  This
[52:07.700 --> 52:09.100]  turned into, like, the
[52:09.100 --> 52:11.080]  weirdest last five minutes.
[52:11.440 --> 52:12.780]  Like, I'm
[52:13.760 --> 52:15.040]  just kind of sitting here
[52:15.040 --> 52:17.000]  stunned by everything you guys are saying.
[52:17.160 --> 52:18.260]  I just can't, like,
[52:19.920 --> 52:20.800]  wild, wild,
[52:20.980 --> 52:23.020]  wild the stuff that you're saying right now.
[52:23.020 --> 52:24.880]  Speaking of weird, Andrew,
[52:24.960 --> 52:27.080]  guess who the first person was to get completely naked
[52:27.080 --> 52:29.000]  in the new office? That's a great
[52:29.000 --> 52:30.020]  question. Oh.
[52:30.780 --> 52:31.460]  Who was it?
[52:33.120 --> 52:34.980]  My instincts, my guess would be
[52:34.980 --> 52:36.860]  Jeff, but I feel like that's too
[52:36.860 --> 52:38.960]  obvious. I'm going to say Nick because he's
[52:38.960 --> 52:39.980]  the least I'd expect.
[52:40.880 --> 52:43.060]  Correct. Incredible
[52:43.060 --> 52:45.020]  guess. Incredible
[52:45.020 --> 52:47.240]  guess. What happened, Nick?
[52:48.060 --> 52:49.040]  I was
[52:49.040 --> 52:51.000]  at the office setting up some audio equipment
[52:51.000 --> 52:52.860]  and I also had to finish
[52:52.860 --> 52:55.060]  an episode, edit, so
[52:55.060 --> 52:57.060]  I was setting that to export and I was
[52:57.060 --> 52:59.160]  like, oh, I got, like, I don't know, 30 minutes
[52:59.160 --> 53:00.840]  to kill. So I drove
[53:02.160 --> 53:03.120]  nearby to go
[53:03.120 --> 53:04.440]  shoot some hoops and
[53:05.260 --> 53:07.020]  came back and I was like, well, I'm all sweaty
[53:07.020 --> 53:08.620]  but I have a change of clothes in the car. I was like,
[53:08.940 --> 53:11.080]  I do have a dinner plan so I
[53:11.080 --> 53:12.960]  should probably not stink. So
[53:12.960 --> 53:14.980]  I used the shower in the office, I turned
[53:14.980 --> 53:16.820]  it on, the water came out brown
[53:17.240 --> 53:17.860]  and then
[53:18.460 --> 53:18.860]  I
[53:18.860 --> 53:21.720]  and then I settled in for a shower,
[53:21.840 --> 53:23.920]  everything was fine and kept the door closed,
[53:24.000 --> 53:25.600]  we have a towel there. Did you buy shampoo?
[53:26.380 --> 53:27.860]  No. He just rinsed off.
[53:28.340 --> 53:29.660]  I bought body wash. Did
[53:29.660 --> 53:31.860]  you find the shower M&Ms I left
[53:31.860 --> 53:33.820]  for Eric? Yeah, I took them out while I
[53:33.820 --> 53:35.520]  showered. Oh, okay. I put them back after it dried.
[53:35.700 --> 53:37.740]  Come on! I'm
[53:37.740 --> 53:39.840]  scared now. I just would have been so
[53:39.840 --> 53:41.880]  disturbed if I showed up at the office
[53:41.880 --> 53:44.020]  and Nick was just completely
[53:44.020 --> 53:45.900]  stark as in the bathroom. I went to
[53:45.900 --> 53:47.700]  the office twice that day. I could have very
[53:47.700 --> 53:50.160]  easily run into him in the shower. That would have been the most confusing
[53:50.160 --> 53:51.860]  thing ever. The door
[53:51.860 --> 53:53.740]  has a lock, guys. It's not like I
[53:53.740 --> 53:55.440]  would have the door open like, look at me!
[53:55.680 --> 53:55.880]  Yeah, but
[53:57.500 --> 53:59.840]  Nick, I randomly roam around
[53:59.840 --> 54:01.640]  the office as a robot. Like,
[54:01.720 --> 54:03.820]  if I saw you walk out with a
[54:03.820 --> 54:05.580]  towel, I would have been alarmed.
[54:06.420 --> 54:07.720]  That's crazy. I had to close
[54:07.720 --> 54:09.720]  into the bathroom. I knew you were
[54:09.720 --> 54:11.800]  there somewhere. I just feel like it would
[54:11.800 --> 54:13.740]  if you hadn't have told me this story,
[54:14.200 --> 54:15.860]  I would have been so disturbed
[54:15.860 --> 54:17.720]  if I came into the office and I heard someone
[54:17.720 --> 54:19.800]  in the shower. I would have thought someone broke in to take
[54:19.800 --> 54:21.900]  a shower. I sure as shit wouldn't have thought
[54:21.900 --> 54:23.520]  one of us was taking a shower there.
[54:24.000 --> 54:24.720]  It's insane.
[54:25.480 --> 54:27.780]  What do you mean? You took a shit the first day.
[54:28.680 --> 54:29.620]  Well, yeah.
[54:30.000 --> 54:31.940]  You got a shit at work.
[54:32.040 --> 54:33.940]  You have to shower at work. I'm not
[54:33.940 --> 54:35.720]  mad that you took the shower. I just think
[54:35.720 --> 54:37.460]  it's wild that it happened that fast.
[54:37.880 --> 54:39.600]  And also, I'm just kind of scared of that bathroom.
[54:40.840 --> 54:41.820]  Yeah, I couldn't
[54:41.820 --> 54:43.380]  figure out how to get hot water. It was very cold.
[54:44.200 --> 54:46.040]  Oh, you just gotta go into the kitchen and take a shower
[54:46.040 --> 54:47.260]  in the fucking kitchen sink.
[54:47.860 --> 54:49.600]  You just keep a basketball in your car?
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.240]  Yeah, I keep a basketball in my car, Andrew.
[54:52.360 --> 54:54.140]  We have the hottest milk coming out of the kitchen sink.
[54:54.260 --> 54:55.920]  I love it. You gotta check it out. It's awesome.
[54:56.520 --> 54:56.940]  The hottest milk?
[54:57.500 --> 54:59.100]  Did he say milk? Yeah.
[54:59.300 --> 55:01.400]  Have you guys not seen how white it turns like milk?
[55:01.500 --> 55:02.040]  Oh, yeah.
[55:03.080 --> 55:05.140]  It's awesome. It's weird.
[55:06.260 --> 55:08.040]  The water's already boiling
[55:08.040 --> 55:09.420]  when it comes out of the spigots.
[55:10.400 --> 55:10.760]  Pfft.
[55:12.620 --> 55:13.340]  Oh, God.
[55:15.300 --> 55:17.800]  Could you get it so hot that it just comes out of steam?
[55:19.900 --> 55:21.560]  That would be crazy.
[55:22.040 --> 55:23.420]  That would have helped the Gumpler.
[55:24.200 --> 55:24.540]  Yeah.
[55:25.280 --> 55:25.640]  Yeah.
[55:27.920 --> 55:29.520]  We should put that out soon. I wanna edit that one.
[55:30.180 --> 55:31.640]  Okay, edit it. Let's do it.
[55:32.380 --> 55:33.040]  Yeah, you're in the files.
[55:33.840 --> 55:34.760]  Yeah, nobody's stopping you.
[55:35.060 --> 55:36.460]  Yeah, you can just edit whenever you want.
[55:36.460 --> 55:38.020]  We're scheduled out quite far.
[55:38.100 --> 55:39.640]  So, I mean, maybe we could...
[55:39.640 --> 55:41.420]  At this point in this recording?
[55:41.700 --> 55:43.640]  Not really. Not super far.
[55:44.360 --> 55:46.500]  I'm worried the Gumpler will come out before this recording.
[55:47.500 --> 55:48.000]  It might.
[55:48.520 --> 55:48.940]  It could, though.
[55:49.440 --> 55:50.240]  That'd be the goal.
[55:51.260 --> 55:52.020]  That's the goal?
[55:54.080 --> 55:55.740]  Jeff just said he was worried about it.
[55:56.440 --> 55:56.800]  But why?
[55:57.180 --> 55:59.400]  That's a good point. They've assuaged my concerns.
[55:59.500 --> 56:00.220]  I'm no longer worried.
[56:00.500 --> 56:01.440]  Problem solved, guys.
[56:02.420 --> 56:03.660]  That's teamwork for you.
[56:05.440 --> 56:07.580]  Would the Gumpler be an overseas edit for you?
[56:08.720 --> 56:08.900]  Oh.
[56:10.460 --> 56:10.900]  Gavin?
[56:12.020 --> 56:13.900]  I don't think I'm gonna take anything.
[56:15.300 --> 56:15.740]  Okay.
[56:16.240 --> 56:16.880]  That's probably smart.
[56:17.420 --> 56:18.680]  Become property of the US government.
[56:22.320 --> 56:23.200]  Does anybody...
[56:23.200 --> 56:26.080]  But now that we're past all that, does anybody mind if I write their phone number
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.420]  in a port-a-potty and said,
[56:27.540 --> 56:29.060]  please text me pictures of your poops?
[56:29.060 --> 56:31.160]  Yeah, don't do that.
[56:31.340 --> 56:32.040]  What about this?
[56:32.160 --> 56:35.380]  I'll go back to the call sheet from 2007.
[56:36.100 --> 56:37.580]  I'll find that medic's number.
[56:38.020 --> 56:38.460]  Wow!
[56:40.280 --> 56:41.580]  Just text him.
[56:41.900 --> 56:42.640]  Text him some shit.
[56:42.960 --> 56:44.780]  You just have to get rid of the zero
[56:44.780 --> 56:46.320]  and put plus four four first.
[56:48.000 --> 56:51.440]  Could you imagine if that's how the wife
[56:51.440 --> 56:53.180]  found out that he was having an affair?
[56:53.680 --> 56:54.940]  With somebody else's shit?
[56:54.940 --> 56:57.000]  Oh god, dude!
[56:57.420 --> 56:58.500]  That is fucking funny.
[56:58.580 --> 57:00.500]  She's like, oh, is she sending you her shit too?
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.280]  Oh my god, she is!
[57:03.820 --> 57:05.060]  She recognized that it was
[57:05.060 --> 57:06.140]  her own making?
[57:06.260 --> 57:07.160]  Yes, yeah.
[57:10.280 --> 57:11.660]  Better just not to cheat, I guess.
[57:13.140 --> 57:14.460]  Keep those shits to yourself.
[57:19.400 --> 57:20.720]  I feel like these podcasts
[57:20.720 --> 57:22.580]  have healed me. I felt pretty shitty at the beginning.
[57:22.660 --> 57:24.080]  You sound so much better.
[57:24.080 --> 57:24.560]  It's better.
[57:26.380 --> 57:27.480]  What's your percentage at now?
[57:27.600 --> 57:30.170]  You were 70% earlier, then you made it 75%.
[57:31.120 --> 57:32.400]  Probably at 80% now.
[57:32.860 --> 57:34.000]  Okay, so you're almost
[57:34.000 --> 57:35.700]  where you were when we were hanging out yesterday.
[57:36.220 --> 57:37.720]  Yeah, maybe if we did a
[57:37.720 --> 57:39.460]  gameplay after this, I'd be fully healed.
[57:40.360 --> 57:41.920]  I mean, in the interest of healing
[57:41.920 --> 57:43.540]  you, I'm willing to give it a try.
[57:44.140 --> 57:44.400]  Yeah.
[57:45.380 --> 57:47.040]  Okay, then we have to wrap this up, right?
[57:47.080 --> 57:48.120]  Shall we wrap up?
[57:48.260 --> 57:51.920]  Yeah, we gotta start wrapping up, don't we?
[57:51.920 --> 57:53.740]  Yeah, but we're not stopping
[57:53.740 --> 57:55.480]  to go play a video game with Gavin.
[57:55.660 --> 57:58.160]  We're stopping because it's the natural conclusion
[57:58.160 --> 57:59.400]  of the podcast.
[57:59.560 --> 58:01.620]  I feel like that's important to
[58:01.620 --> 58:02.280]  mention.
[58:03.260 --> 58:05.500]  This is where we all
[58:06.820 --> 58:07.700]  instinctively felt
[58:07.700 --> 58:09.080]  it was time to end.
[58:10.400 --> 58:11.660]  I have a final
[58:12.500 --> 58:13.060]  suggestion.
[58:13.460 --> 58:15.060]  A little pitch for the group.
[58:16.140 --> 58:17.840]  No one will get back to me about
[58:17.840 --> 58:19.160]  getting squirrels out of my ceiling.
[58:19.160 --> 58:21.060]  What if we tackled it as a group?
[58:21.920 --> 58:22.340]  Glove up.
[58:23.080 --> 58:23.880]  Mask up.
[58:24.640 --> 58:25.360]  Get in the ceiling.
[58:26.560 --> 58:29.000]  Here's what we can do. We'll treat them like bacon bits.
[58:29.260 --> 58:29.660]  We'll get my
[58:30.940 --> 58:32.900]  leaf blower up there and we'll try to blow them out.
[58:33.480 --> 58:35.120]  Can you put me up there?
[58:35.440 --> 58:37.120]  Can you bring me over as the robot?
[58:37.340 --> 58:39.260]  Put me up there and I'll roam around for you.
[58:39.400 --> 58:40.860]  I'll chase them out. I'll scurry them.
[58:41.740 --> 58:43.260]  Now, I can't speak for the quality
[58:43.260 --> 58:45.100]  of the ceiling in there, but
[58:45.100 --> 58:45.660]  we'll try.
[58:46.540 --> 58:47.760]  I love this idea.
[58:48.400 --> 58:49.100]  Put me in there.
[58:49.480 --> 58:51.140]  Also, do you guys think I should...
[58:51.140 --> 58:53.980]  You remember how when I layered all my peas together it sounded like
[58:53.980 --> 58:54.600]  Niagara Falls?
[58:56.200 --> 58:57.920]  Oh, I can replay it for you if you'd like.
[58:57.960 --> 58:59.380]  I remember when you did that.
[59:00.300 --> 59:01.160]  Yeah, you remember when I did that?
[59:01.500 --> 59:03.760]  Somebody in the comments recently suggested
[59:03.760 --> 59:06.020]  that I do that with shits
[59:06.020 --> 59:07.740]  and farts. Do you think I can
[59:07.740 --> 59:09.440]  make it sound like an atom bomb?
[59:09.820 --> 59:11.660]  No, I don't want you to do it.
[59:11.740 --> 59:12.920]  Please don't do it. Thank you.
[59:12.920 --> 59:14.580]  It might sound like a tractor starting.
[59:15.820 --> 59:17.040]  Oh, that's interesting.
[59:17.760 --> 59:19.200]  Well, maybe I'll play around with it.
[59:19.340 --> 59:20.740]  It sounds like you have
[59:21.360 --> 59:22.900]  material for when we do the Foley
[59:22.900 --> 59:23.200]  thing.
[59:25.260 --> 59:27.020]  I've got a very particular way I'd like to do my
[59:27.020 --> 59:27.560]  Foley work.
[59:32.260 --> 59:35.020]  Alright, that'll do it. Oh, you know what?
[59:35.720 --> 59:36.960]  We should watch... I was thinking
[59:36.960 --> 59:39.000]  this the other day, too. We should all
[59:39.000 --> 59:40.960]  watch a trilogy together that none of us
[59:40.960 --> 59:42.020]  have ever seen before.
[59:42.580 --> 59:44.760]  That might be hard to find, a trilogy that
[59:45.140 --> 59:46.940]  none of us have seen any of, but
[59:46.940 --> 59:48.160]  we should watch it in reverse.
[59:50.960 --> 59:52.400]  So each one is a prequel?
[59:52.860 --> 59:53.100]  Yeah.
[59:55.460 --> 59:57.000]  Because everybody always starts
[59:57.000 --> 59:58.820]  off and they're like, I like the trilogy
[59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.860]  but the first one was the best, and then it just
[01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.780]  went downhill or whatever. What if
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:04.720]  you watch it in reverse, you feel differently?
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.860]  What if we think the third one is the best
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.700]  because it's the first one we watched?
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.760]  Or, if that's the case, what if
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.720]  the trilogy just gets better as we build?
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.760]  Could you imagine if someone had never
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.740]  seen the Matrix movies and watched them backwards?
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.540]  Oh, man. It'd be amazing.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.100]  It'd be amazing.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.940]  Or the Godfather, or any of that stuff, right?
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:23.780]  That would be great.
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.420]  We just have to identify what that trilogy is.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:27.600]  I wonder if there is one
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.800]  that none of us have seen.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.800]  I mean, there's probably a lot of foreign language trilogies
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.100]  that none of us have seen, but... Definitely.
[01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:35.900]  I'm gonna guess...
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.560]  You know what? I've never seen
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.520]  any of the, uh...
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.880]  What are they, like, uh...
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:43.600]  Air Force One? The one where
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.520]  Aaron Eckhart saves the president
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.760]  because his planes always crash?
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.260]  I've seen all of this.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:50.260]  I've only seen one.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.760]  How many Riddick films are there?
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.340]  I've seen a couple. I've seen those, right?
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.980]  Yeah, I've seen them. How many XXX films are there?
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.600]  I've seen them. Three of those.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:00:59.960]  I've seen them.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.420]  Yeah, it's gonna be hard. I've got so many
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:05.500]  open trilogies, but...
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.460]  I guess we'll have to watch Charmed
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:08.940]  first, and then we'll get to this.
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:10.920]  What's that?
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.080]  Wheel of Decades,
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:14.640]  motherfucker!
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.500]  Alright, that'll probably
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.480]  do it for episode 58.
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:21.180]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.340]  We really enjoyed spending the last
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.400]  hour and five minutes or so with you.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.620]  We hope to see you right back here
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.460]  in this very spot next
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.100]  week for episode 59
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.620]  of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.040]  It's gonna blow your dick off.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:34.900]  Woah.
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.260]  Okay. Check out the Patreon.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:41.180]  Hang on to your dicks.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.560]  We'll see you next time. Bye!
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:43.240]  Bye!
