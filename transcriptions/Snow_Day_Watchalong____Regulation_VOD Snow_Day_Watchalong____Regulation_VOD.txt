[01:57.350 --> 01:58.790]  Is this a Nickelodeon movie?
[01:58.790 --> 02:00.690]  It's a Nickelodeon film.
[02:00.830 --> 02:02.070]  But you saw it in the theaters?
[02:02.490 --> 02:03.670]  I sure did.
[02:04.490 --> 02:04.890]  How does that work?
[02:04.890 --> 02:06.550]  Was it theatrically released?
[02:06.890 --> 02:08.370]  Was it Nickelodeon films or something?
[02:08.530 --> 02:11.190]  Yeah, Nickelodeon studios was...
[02:11.850 --> 02:12.070]  Like Good Burger?
[02:12.510 --> 02:18.230]  Like Good Burger, at a time in the late 90s and early 2000s, was trying to make films.
[02:18.470 --> 02:25.410]  They were doing... they were doing movies and I don't know that they banged.
[02:25.730 --> 02:27.590]  But they sure made them.
[02:27.590 --> 02:29.690]  At the time, for me, they sure did.
[02:30.070 --> 02:33.030]  Rugrats goes to Paris, classic. Rugrats the movie.
[02:33.670 --> 02:39.690]  The universally loved and easy to work with Chevy Chase is in this film?
[02:40.190 --> 02:40.490]  Yes.
[02:42.430 --> 02:43.690]  And Chris Elliott.
[02:44.230 --> 02:45.330]  So I haven't seen this movie.
[02:45.330 --> 02:46.270]  Chris Elliott's in this film?
[02:46.430 --> 02:47.990]  Yeah, Chris Elliott is in this movie.
[02:48.490 --> 02:50.390]  Oh, I guarantee you I like this movie.
[02:50.550 --> 02:52.270]  I've never not liked Chris Elliott.
[02:53.270 --> 02:54.150]  So what I enjoyed...
[02:54.850 --> 02:55.310]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[02:55.310 --> 02:58.830]  Andrew, you were saying that he's he's just trying to do his job in this movie?
[02:58.950 --> 03:03.670]  Yes. So I watched this as a child and was like, fuck Chris Elliott. He sucks. He's the villain.
[03:03.850 --> 03:03.990]  Yeah.
[03:04.150 --> 03:07.050]  And then I saw like 10 minutes of this a few years ago.
[03:07.210 --> 03:10.230]  And it was, oh, he's just he's just a snowplow driver.
[03:10.410 --> 03:15.470]  Like he's weird, but like he's just doing his job, which is very funny.
[03:16.570 --> 03:20.190]  I just found out that Chris Elliott's daughter was like on SNL.
[03:20.750 --> 03:21.610]  Abby Elliott. Yeah.
[03:22.110 --> 03:24.230]  Abby Elliott. I only just found out that that's her.
[03:24.230 --> 03:27.390]  I didn't know that that was I didn't know that was Chris Elliott's daughter.
[03:27.870 --> 03:32.030]  I think she also I don't remember it was I remember it was in like the gossip,
[03:32.210 --> 03:35.490]  the trades, but I believe she had a bad time on SNL or it didn't go well or something.
[03:36.010 --> 03:37.510]  I believe that that is true.
[03:37.610 --> 03:39.450]  I think she was only there for like a little while, wasn't she?
[03:39.490 --> 03:40.570]  Yeah, like maybe two seasons.
[03:41.070 --> 03:41.710]  SNL 2008 to 2012.
[03:42.670 --> 03:44.190]  Just funny. I remember thinking she was funny.
[03:46.010 --> 03:46.970]  What was that, Gavin?
[03:48.410 --> 03:50.010]  It's just crunch the show, isn't it?
[03:50.550 --> 03:53.030]  That that whole sort of having to do that shit every week.
[03:53.030 --> 03:54.770]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:54.770 --> 04:00.790]  I think it's for people who are addicted to the crunch and also for a while, cocaine.
[04:01.890 --> 04:05.230]  And who want to be the next Adam Sandler and turn into a movie star.
[04:05.970 --> 04:07.530]  Yes, I think that has a lot to do with it.
[04:07.550 --> 04:09.310]  Also, Kyle Mooney's been making a lot of movies.
[04:09.390 --> 04:09.990]  I think that's great.
[04:10.550 --> 04:11.670]  Yeah, Kyle Mooney's great, dude.
[04:12.570 --> 04:13.210]  Yeah, awesome.
[04:13.370 --> 04:15.090]  I mean, I don't know, personally, I just think he's funny.
[04:16.010 --> 04:17.450]  He's a San Diego guy, so you got to love him.
[04:17.590 --> 04:18.750]  Guys, here's the thing.
[04:18.970 --> 04:21.150]  I think it's time for us to begin watching Snow Days.
[04:21.230 --> 04:22.790]  Everyone locked in Snow Day style.
[04:22.790 --> 04:23.470]  I think we're writing.
[04:23.650 --> 04:24.550]  So locked in.
[04:24.970 --> 04:27.710]  All right, I'm going to dim my screen to make it slightly more cinematic.
[04:28.090 --> 04:29.290]  Oh, that's fun for you.
[04:30.210 --> 04:31.450]  Going to go all in on Nick.
[04:31.570 --> 04:33.430]  I had the soundtrack to this movie.
[04:33.530 --> 04:35.350]  This was a big movie in my childhood.
[04:35.990 --> 04:36.770]  I loved it.
[04:37.790 --> 04:41.270]  So are we introing this like we would a regular piece of content then?
[04:41.410 --> 04:44.590]  Just to I think everything we just did could be the intro to this.
[04:44.630 --> 04:45.510]  And now we can start it.
[04:45.610 --> 04:46.290]  So we just OK.
[04:46.990 --> 04:48.350]  Hey, someone in chat, do the intro.
[04:49.550 --> 04:52.910]  Nick, count them down.
[04:53.130 --> 04:59.710]  All right, guys, we're going to start the movie in three, two, one, go.
[05:00.650 --> 05:01.470]  Oh, my God.
[05:01.550 --> 05:02.550]  I got a piece of trivia.
[05:02.990 --> 05:09.170]  According to dash cam underscore one, Snow Day was first referenced in Face podcast episode 22.
[05:09.830 --> 05:10.850]  Is that right?
[05:11.130 --> 05:11.670]  Some history.
[05:11.810 --> 05:15.210]  I said, wow, I like the old Paramount logo.
[05:16.250 --> 05:16.650]  Yeah, it's great.
[05:16.850 --> 05:17.310]  Is it different now?
[05:17.790 --> 05:18.330]  It's just a little bit different.
[05:18.810 --> 05:20.730]  A little bit more HD.
[05:20.910 --> 05:21.930]  Whoa, that's a lot of snow.
[05:22.450 --> 05:26.010]  Oh, this is on VHS.
[05:28.550 --> 05:29.690]  It looks that way.
[05:30.770 --> 05:31.490]  That's cool.
[05:31.730 --> 05:33.130]  It's like younger MTV.
[05:38.520 --> 05:41.840]  Wow, there's a lot of logos and stuff.
[05:41.940 --> 05:42.420]  Oh, never mind.
[05:47.400 --> 05:47.660]  Nerd.
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.060]  Oh, my God, put me to sleep.
[05:59.420 --> 06:00.660]  The rebel of mine.
[06:05.200 --> 06:07.520]  They say that no two snowflakes are the same.
[06:07.660 --> 06:09.660]  Is that true or is that just like a thing?
[06:09.920 --> 06:10.580]  I think it's true.
[06:10.700 --> 06:10.920]  Like people say.
[06:11.460 --> 06:12.100]  I think it's true.
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.640]  Yeah, those things that I joke.
[06:17.680 --> 06:18.080]  Snowflakes.
[06:18.660 --> 06:20.620]  Yeah, it's no, it's no snow fluke.
[06:21.260 --> 06:25.780]  But isn't it like a, it's not like a, like a fingerprints thing where it's like by the
[06:25.780 --> 06:28.040]  numbers, you have fingerprints that are like someone else, probably.
[06:28.940 --> 06:29.680]  No, I don't think.
[06:29.740 --> 06:30.980]  Why are you used to stuff being the same?
[06:31.060 --> 06:32.380]  Like, have you ever seen two of the same leaf?
[06:32.780 --> 06:35.620]  Are you used to stuff being the same?
[06:36.420 --> 06:39.180]  Yeah, I feel like I've probably seen two of the same leaf.
[06:39.220 --> 06:40.480]  Yeah, that's no way.
[06:41.700 --> 06:42.360]  You don't think so?
[06:42.460 --> 06:45.000]  I mean, you've never, you don't think there's twin leaves?
[06:45.080 --> 06:45.820]  Like there's twin humans?
[06:46.740 --> 06:48.140]  Where does this movie take place?
[06:49.200 --> 06:50.580]  Whoa, I don't know.
[06:50.740 --> 06:51.440]  Oh, Michigan.
[06:52.740 --> 06:54.800]  Are you just guessing or is that true?
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.560]  Oh no, I'm just saying that.
[06:56.880 --> 07:00.760]  I figured Canada because Andrew's Canadian and it was cold, but I just realized that's
[07:00.760 --> 07:01.340]  probably not true.
[07:02.300 --> 07:03.320]  Looks like the Northeast.
[07:03.660 --> 07:04.460]  Yeah, we're about to find out.
[07:09.890 --> 07:10.330]  Syracuse.
[07:10.470 --> 07:10.990]  Oh no.
[07:15.410 --> 07:17.870]  That's like how it is in Austin right now.
[07:21.700 --> 07:22.880]  Did she say hot body?
[07:23.220 --> 07:24.000]  Yeah, he loves it.
[07:26.930 --> 07:28.510]  He's walking to the director right now.
[07:31.690 --> 07:35.210]  They made him do this in the movie and he's about to he's about to call someone a slur.
[07:36.710 --> 07:40.070]  He thought this was Christmas Vacation 2 for the first two weeks.
[07:41.570 --> 07:43.450]  I don't think I've seen him in this era.
[07:44.790 --> 07:45.270]  Oh, really?
[07:46.370 --> 07:51.210]  Like, I feel like I go from Christmas Vacation to the more recent stuff.
[07:51.450 --> 07:52.670]  Is that Pam Greer?
[07:54.010 --> 07:59.770]  This would be it looked like this would be in the era of like Cops and Robertsons and
[07:59.770 --> 08:01.250]  Vegas Vacation, I think.
[08:01.990 --> 08:02.410]  Oh, yeah.
[08:03.750 --> 08:05.510]  That's absolutely Pam Greer.
[08:05.810 --> 08:08.770]  That from frickin that Steven Seagal movie.
[08:09.090 --> 08:10.490]  Is that Bo Duke?
[08:11.090 --> 08:11.850]  It is.
[08:11.950 --> 08:13.630]  That is absolutely Bo Duke.
[08:14.390 --> 08:15.750]  This is insane.
[08:17.690 --> 08:18.670]  What'd you say, Andrew?
[08:18.830 --> 08:19.230]  Ithaca.
[08:19.390 --> 08:20.010]  Who's Bo Duke?
[08:20.810 --> 08:22.330]  Bo and Luke Duke were the Duke boys.
[08:22.330 --> 08:24.290]  He's one of the Duke boys.
[08:24.470 --> 08:26.370]  Oh, Duke's a hazard.
[08:26.930 --> 08:30.990]  Pretty sure he's a he's a Duke of MAGA now, as I understand.
[08:30.990 --> 08:32.410]  Is that Dan Castellaneta?
[08:33.350 --> 08:33.830]  No.
[08:34.130 --> 08:34.470]  No.
[08:35.270 --> 08:36.530]  I'm just trying to guess now.
[08:37.850 --> 08:38.690]  That's Ken Weaver.
[08:44.220 --> 08:44.960]  Oh, I've seen him.
[08:45.020 --> 08:45.760]  Is he in Ozark?
[08:47.000 --> 08:48.280]  He might have been.
[08:48.580 --> 08:49.880]  Is he like the lawyer guy in Ozark?
[08:50.520 --> 08:52.240]  Oh, it's Drake or Josh.
[08:52.600 --> 08:53.400]  It's Josh.
[08:54.240 --> 08:55.600]  I don't know which one it is.
[08:55.600 --> 08:56.960]  My kid watched that shit a lot.
[08:57.440 --> 08:57.560]  Yeah.
[09:01.680 --> 09:03.460]  He's doing his best Jim Carrey right here.
[09:08.740 --> 09:10.620]  He's really chewing the scenery here, bud.
[09:11.200 --> 09:12.620]  Oh, this is grounded in reality.
[09:13.460 --> 09:14.340]  Uh-huh.
[09:20.600 --> 09:21.820]  God, it's fucking...
[09:23.160 --> 09:25.320]  Was this movie funded by math?
[09:27.320 --> 09:27.760]  Yeah.
[09:28.900 --> 09:29.940]  Fucking big math.
[09:30.120 --> 09:32.800]  Like the math council was like, we got to get we got to get cool.
[09:33.300 --> 09:34.000]  How do we do it?
[09:34.160 --> 09:35.160]  Nickelodeon kids movies.
[09:37.380 --> 09:38.420]  It's all the food pyramid.
[09:38.580 --> 09:39.920]  We got to we got to get back on the top.
[09:40.040 --> 09:40.300]  Yeah.
[09:41.080 --> 09:41.440]  Yeah.
[09:44.670 --> 09:46.230]  We're getting blitzed by this milk.
[09:46.250 --> 09:47.590]  It does a body good bullshit.
[09:48.290 --> 09:48.650]  Yeah.
[09:49.910 --> 09:53.170]  What I think is interesting is the whole hook of this movie is having a snow day
[09:53.170 --> 09:54.930]  so you don't have to go to school.
[09:54.930 --> 09:58.470]  But I feel like that doesn't exist anymore with like remote learning.
[09:59.110 --> 10:01.810]  Oh, do you just learn from home if you don't go to school?
[10:02.070 --> 10:04.870]  I feel like they have the infrastructure now to just do that.
[10:04.990 --> 10:06.830]  You think people can pivot on the spot to that?
[10:06.830 --> 10:09.150]  I feel like Nick would not.
[10:09.270 --> 10:10.830]  Well, I guess your kid's not quite old enough.
[10:11.150 --> 10:15.090]  I think I would think that once they dismantle that shit, it doesn't come back.
[10:15.370 --> 10:19.990]  Like my kid, you know, she was her entire freshman year was work from home.
[10:20.210 --> 10:24.870]  And that that school had no desire to go back to that after.
[10:24.990 --> 10:29.170]  I would imagine that they were probably just teachers probably want the snow day as badly
[10:29.170 --> 10:29.790]  as the students.
[10:30.690 --> 10:37.450]  They went so hard on doing, you know, online resources and things and utilizing
[10:38.990 --> 10:42.290]  that as opposed to like physical paper and things of that nature
[10:42.290 --> 10:46.950]  that they were doing midterms this past week and the district lost power.
[10:48.090 --> 10:52.750]  And turns out they weren't able to do the tests because they had no power to run the computers.
[10:55.500 --> 10:57.320]  Who is this kid? What's he been in?
[10:58.600 --> 11:00.080]  Is he somebody as a grown up?
[11:00.300 --> 11:04.400]  He he's been in a lot of stuff, but I don't know what you would necessarily reckon.
[11:04.640 --> 11:08.040]  He's a real 90s, early 2000s looking kid.
[11:08.880 --> 11:11.700]  His fucking voice is super familiar to me.
[11:12.160 --> 11:12.600]  Green room.
[11:14.100 --> 11:17.860]  Ah, he was in green room and and Scott Pilgrim.
[11:18.380 --> 11:22.000]  Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't know him from that, but that's probably what I would know him from.
[11:22.100 --> 11:22.240]  Yeah.
[11:23.340 --> 11:25.720]  He's like the friend in Scott Pilgrim.
[11:28.880 --> 11:29.680]  Oh, yeah.
[11:32.080 --> 11:34.160]  Which who is named Steven Stills.
[11:34.320 --> 11:35.900]  I forgot that that's what Scott Pilgrim is like.
[11:35.940 --> 11:38.800]  It's just referencing things that you learn about when you're 22.
[11:41.280 --> 11:41.680]  Slums!
[11:42.600 --> 11:44.840]  You think you're the first person that discovered it?
[11:45.120 --> 11:49.000]  Yeah, and then you read Scott Pilgrim and it gives you all the references on a silver
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.280]  platter and it becomes your favorite thing.
[11:50.360 --> 11:50.800]  It's awesome.
[11:51.020 --> 11:51.200]  Yeah.
[11:52.120 --> 11:53.180]  Dude, look at that hat.
[11:56.440 --> 11:58.560]  I'm going to start looking like this again.
[11:59.140 --> 12:00.020]  Please don't.
[12:00.080 --> 12:01.160]  I'm going to get a step haircut.
[12:01.440 --> 12:02.200]  I'm going to bleach it.
[12:02.300 --> 12:04.980]  I'm going to get a black leather jacket and a bright ass yellow car.
[12:05.140 --> 12:05.780]  This rocks.
[12:06.060 --> 12:08.480]  It looks like kind of a bowl cut on the back somehow.
[12:08.660 --> 12:09.080]  Yeah.
[12:10.480 --> 12:11.200]  Back bowl.
[12:12.700 --> 12:15.520]  I could be wrong, but I think he was in Final Destination.
[12:16.000 --> 12:17.300]  He looks like a guy.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.520]  I don't know if he is.
[12:19.680 --> 12:22.940]  He just looks like a guy who would be in Final Destination.
[12:23.620 --> 12:27.000]  How many Final Destination films are there?
[12:27.120 --> 12:28.220]  It's like six or seven.
[12:28.800 --> 12:31.860]  I think there's like a considerable amount.
[12:31.980 --> 12:32.100]  Yeah.
[12:32.340 --> 12:33.820]  I think Nick is way off as well.
[12:33.980 --> 12:35.500]  Nick said four with such confidence.
[12:35.940 --> 12:36.520]  I thought four.
[12:36.760 --> 12:38.740]  Yeah, he made me completely shift.
[12:39.040 --> 12:40.360]  I thought four looped back to the beginning.
[12:40.500 --> 12:45.760]  I realized that I've only seen the first two and there's like five more or something to watch
[12:45.760 --> 12:46.700]  and they're still going.
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.980]  I'm going to have like a Final Destination marathon.
[12:50.840 --> 12:51.980]  I think there's six.
[12:51.980 --> 12:53.620]  There's five.
[12:53.940 --> 12:54.820]  They're making it.
[12:54.860 --> 12:56.200]  Guys, get your shit together.
[12:56.560 --> 12:57.920]  I'm looking at it right now.
[12:58.140 --> 13:00.920]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
[13:01.100 --> 13:01.440]  Bloodlines.
[13:01.920 --> 13:03.400]  Bloodlines comes out next year.
[13:03.500 --> 13:04.680]  Jeff, we'll go see Bloodlines, dude.
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.380]  Dude, I got to watch one through five again real fast, but I'm down for it.
[13:08.480 --> 13:09.580]  Well, let me get an event.
[13:10.000 --> 13:11.420]  It'll be like a regulation movie.
[13:12.200 --> 13:14.360]  What's the best death in a Final Destination?
[13:15.220 --> 13:15.680]  Well, I don't know.
[13:15.740 --> 13:20.120]  Kid sloughs in the tub and gets strangled via a wire.
[13:20.120 --> 13:21.940]  I think it's the...
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.360]  I think it's being on the highway and like the logs come out and everything,
[13:26.540 --> 13:29.240]  because I feel like everyone feels that all the time when they're driving.
[13:30.020 --> 13:30.800]  Here, especially.
[13:31.080 --> 13:31.300]  Yeah.
[13:32.060 --> 13:37.000]  When I was in college, I had a professor who was a producer for Final Destination
[13:37.000 --> 13:37.860]  when it was coming out.
[13:37.980 --> 13:39.820]  The one that came out in like 2008 or 2009.
[13:40.720 --> 13:42.240]  And that was interesting.
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.460]  She would just kind of tell us about like, here's what we're in the middle of.
[13:45.580 --> 13:47.900]  And it's like, how do you have time to teach a class?
[13:50.240 --> 13:51.700]  Tell us how they died again, teacher.
[13:53.800 --> 13:54.460]  Oh, my God.
[13:54.560 --> 13:57.200]  Tony Todd is going to be in Final Destination 6, probably.
[13:57.340 --> 13:57.860]  That's crazy.
[13:58.220 --> 13:59.340]  Where did I just see him?
[14:00.020 --> 14:00.400]  Indiana Jones.
[14:00.500 --> 14:01.820]  Oh, he was in Indiana Jones.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.780]  He's like seven feet tall in Indiana Jones.
[14:03.880 --> 14:04.340]  It's so weird.
[14:06.240 --> 14:06.920]  Oh, yeah.
[14:09.120 --> 14:09.900]  He's the giant.
[14:09.920 --> 14:10.480]  Oh, it's...
[14:10.480 --> 14:11.280]  It kicks the shit out of me.
[14:11.300 --> 14:11.500]  Is that Jean Smart?
[14:12.840 --> 14:13.860]  She was on 24.
[14:15.560 --> 14:17.120]  She's in that show, Hacks, isn't she?
[14:17.660 --> 14:17.820]  Yes.
[14:17.820 --> 14:18.400]  Is it her new show?
[14:18.820 --> 14:19.100]  Yeah.
[14:21.120 --> 14:22.500]  She's on top of the world.
[14:23.340 --> 14:23.460]  Yep.
[14:24.220 --> 14:30.620]  She was in, uh, she was in, uh, uh, the movie about the TV show about the ladies.
[14:31.900 --> 14:33.200]  Boy, every mom had this haircut.
[14:33.320 --> 14:33.540]  Golden Girls.
[14:34.060 --> 14:34.360]  24.
[14:34.460 --> 14:35.160]  No, the other one.
[14:35.220 --> 14:35.600]  Desperate Housewives.
[14:38.200 --> 14:38.960]  Designing Women.
[14:41.320 --> 14:41.760]  Yeah.
[14:42.080 --> 14:43.140]  Was she in Designing Women?
[14:43.620 --> 14:44.460]  Yeah, wasn't she?
[14:45.360 --> 14:45.700]  Oh.
[14:46.140 --> 14:46.920]  I don't, I don't remember.
[14:46.920 --> 14:49.800]  It was like her and Annie Potts and Delta Burke.
[14:50.420 --> 14:53.600]  Yeah, Jean Smart, Delta Burke, Dixie Carter, and Annie Potts.
[14:54.160 --> 14:54.520]  Wow.
[14:55.660 --> 14:59.400]  I just don't, like, when I think of her, that's just not what I think of her from.
[14:59.540 --> 15:00.080]  That's interesting.
[15:00.800 --> 15:02.120]  What do you think of her from?
[15:02.540 --> 15:04.440]  I don't. She's just a TV actress.
[15:06.720 --> 15:08.860]  I'd, I'd send you the link, but we're in a different chat.
[15:08.920 --> 15:11.900]  Like the, the mom from the Oblongs.
[15:12.120 --> 15:14.300]  Like that's when I hear her voice, that's what I hear.
[15:15.300 --> 15:17.320]  I don't like how close that bread is to the soup.
[15:18.800 --> 15:20.360]  He's keeping an eye on it.
[15:20.400 --> 15:21.020]  Yeah, just.
[15:22.100 --> 15:28.360]  So you're not a, you're not a, you're not a dip your grilled cheese and tomato soup kind of guy,
[15:28.420 --> 15:28.820]  are you, Gavin?
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.540]  Uh, I can if it's in for like a second or less. I'm a quick dipper.
[15:33.700 --> 15:34.180]  Quick dip.
[15:34.300 --> 15:38.260]  Now, do you get, do you find value in that? If you quick dip like that, is it enjoyable?
[15:39.040 --> 15:39.380]  Yeah.
[15:40.000 --> 15:40.340]  Okay.
[15:40.560 --> 15:43.460]  But the way he's just left that one unattended, I could slough in at any point.
[15:43.460 --> 15:45.560]  Oh yeah, it's right on the edge. Gotta be careful.
[15:45.560 --> 15:45.820]  Yeah.
[15:46.700 --> 15:51.260]  What is it that you like about it? Is it the danger that you could take it too far and ruin it?
[15:51.340 --> 15:52.600]  So you gotta like thread the needle?
[15:53.140 --> 15:55.440]  No, I'm not like edging my grilled cheese.
[15:55.740 --> 15:56.800]  It sounds like you might be.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.960]  It sounds like that's what I've decided you're doing.
[15:59.000 --> 15:59.900]  Make sure my grilled cheese doesn't come.
[16:02.500 --> 16:02.780]  Oh.
[16:06.860 --> 16:07.260]  Waited!
[16:09.340 --> 16:12.340]  I caught Gavin doing that in his bedroom after his third date with Meg.
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.960]  Putting on his little anklet and listening to the song.
[16:18.180 --> 16:20.060]  Oh, that was a hairy footshot.
[16:20.720 --> 16:21.640]  Nick's going crazy.
[16:24.840 --> 16:26.220]  I'm sorry, I was thinking about Foreigner.
[16:27.240 --> 16:27.640]  Sure.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.700]  So long.
[16:37.000 --> 16:37.440]  You're done.
[16:38.760 --> 16:39.820]  Foreigner's got some baggers.
[16:40.320 --> 16:40.840]  Yeah, dude.
[16:41.140 --> 16:42.160]  Nothing wrong with them, man.
[16:43.660 --> 16:46.600]  Well, head games, hot-blooded, cold as ice.
[16:48.140 --> 16:50.500]  Willing to sacrifice our love.
[16:50.740 --> 16:52.940]  I got nothing, nothing but love for Foreigner.
[16:53.440 --> 16:56.020]  That was yesterday. I heard Trump was going to deport them.
[17:00.610 --> 17:02.350]  That guy in Craven should watch out then.
[17:04.510 --> 17:06.370]  I heard from Eric that that movie's not good.
[17:07.590 --> 17:09.530]  He's absolutely right. Ask Nick.
[17:11.110 --> 17:13.770]  The best part about that movie was the pizza I ate during it.
[17:13.770 --> 17:14.110]  Yep.
[17:16.130 --> 17:19.890]  I feel like that would be the best part of most movies you watch,
[17:19.930 --> 17:21.970]  is whatever food you have with it.
[17:22.410 --> 17:25.450]  Yeah, but it's exceptionally true when you watch Craven the Hunter.
[17:27.350 --> 17:30.230]  That's a shame because he's a cool character in the comic books.
[17:31.090 --> 17:35.270]  He is, but what if he was like a 30-year-old guy with abs?
[17:35.370 --> 17:38.750]  Have you considered that instead of an interesting guy who hunts?
[17:39.190 --> 17:39.870]  I hadn't.
[17:39.870 --> 17:40.930]  Are the abs a cut off?
[17:42.450 --> 17:45.230]  Yeah, dude, I was so soft the whole time.
[17:48.540 --> 17:50.140]  Anyway, 16 years earlier.
[17:51.540 --> 17:53.740]  Dude, that movie, it sucks. Craven sucks.
[17:58.490 --> 18:01.470]  Jeff, do you lament the time of diner culture?
[18:01.910 --> 18:04.810]  It doesn't feel like we're in a diner culture anymore.
[18:05.510 --> 18:09.130]  I think diner culture ended in 2000.
[18:10.610 --> 18:11.470]  That was it?
[18:11.930 --> 18:13.270]  Did Snowdale get replaced by?
[18:13.270 --> 18:15.950]  No, that's too early. I'm sorry. Let me think about that.
[18:16.050 --> 18:18.510]  Maybe 2006, diner culture started.
[18:19.190 --> 18:22.590]  I mean, I was in high school and stuff. We would go to diner.
[18:22.690 --> 18:24.030]  This is what we would do.
[18:25.210 --> 18:27.970]  Gus and I or whoever, Jason, Bernie, whoever,
[18:28.050 --> 18:30.910]  we would always go after we were drinking downtown or whatever.
[18:31.070 --> 18:34.830]  You would always go to Starseeds or Magnolia or somewhere
[18:34.830 --> 18:37.330]  to sop up some sobriety.
[18:38.490 --> 18:40.770]  Now there's so few, there's none.
[18:40.770 --> 18:43.710]  Well, there's hardly any 24-hour diners in Austin anymore.
[18:43.830 --> 18:45.290]  They used to be one in every fucking corner.
[18:46.310 --> 18:48.110]  Is this first generation Bucket Hat?
[18:49.050 --> 18:49.950]  Yeah, Starseeds is gone.
[18:50.610 --> 18:51.530]  Oh, they closed it?
[18:52.050 --> 18:54.370]  I thought they were just shutting down for the 35 expansion.
[18:54.370 --> 18:56.810]  No, dude, they're bulldozing it. They bulldoze the hotel around it.
[18:56.910 --> 18:59.390]  Starseeds, it might be gone by now.
[18:59.550 --> 19:01.850]  I drove by yesterday and it was...
[19:01.850 --> 19:03.490]  They're supposed to be moving it, I think.
[19:03.570 --> 19:05.870]  But then also, I don't believe...
[19:05.870 --> 19:08.730]  If it never came back, I'd be like, oh yeah, of course.
[19:08.730 --> 19:10.690]  Yeah, I don't think that place is coming back.
[19:10.750 --> 19:12.650]  And if it does, I don't know.
[19:13.210 --> 19:15.830]  You know, it's funny you mentioned 2006 as the year it died.
[19:15.910 --> 19:18.010]  Because that's the year I got here and started college.
[19:18.070 --> 19:21.910]  And it was when I started getting to experience diners more on my own.
[19:22.650 --> 19:23.910]  In a new place.
[19:24.570 --> 19:26.670]  And you're right, after that, everything...
[19:26.670 --> 19:31.350]  They had the original Kirby Lane by the campus that had all that old interior that was shitty.
[19:31.970 --> 19:33.830]  And it was hodgepodge of stuff.
[19:34.170 --> 19:35.110]  That building's a piece of shit.
[19:35.750 --> 19:38.350]  Yeah, but it was a fun piece of shit.
[19:38.350 --> 19:40.610]  It's even like... I mean, I know...
[19:40.610 --> 19:45.530]  Obviously, there are people that are listening to this and think we're ridiculous because they go to diners at night all the time.
[19:45.610 --> 19:48.010]  But I do think that there's something that has changed about it.
[19:48.110 --> 19:52.630]  Because A, a lot of those diners stopped being 24 hours a day because they weren't full anymore.
[19:53.150 --> 20:00.390]  And then, even in 2004, if you would go downtown at 2.30 in the morning, the IHOP right there at Cesar Chavez,
[20:00.710 --> 20:02.150]  there'd be a line out the door.
[20:02.310 --> 20:04.330]  That's not necessarily the case anymore.
[20:05.870 --> 20:07.170]  What do you think the fakes know us?
[20:08.590 --> 20:10.210]  What do you think they're doing here?
[20:10.590 --> 20:11.730]  Hopefully not asbestos.
[20:12.670 --> 20:13.870]  Wizard of Oz style?
[20:15.230 --> 20:17.370]  It's the beginnings of mesothelioma.
[20:18.730 --> 20:21.950]  We're getting so many shots of this girl with her tongue out.
[20:27.270 --> 20:28.570]  I hate it.
[20:28.850 --> 20:29.170]  Yeah.
[20:30.530 --> 20:33.790]  There's a guy in this that they showed a couple of times.
[20:33.870 --> 20:35.610]  He's wearing a big floppy hat.
[20:36.750 --> 20:36.910]  Yeah.
[20:37.230 --> 20:39.850]  Yeah, but if I bleach my hair and do it like that other guy,
[20:39.850 --> 20:42.870]  will you just start wearing a floppy hat for as long as I have the bleached hair?
[20:47.830 --> 20:48.630]  How bleached?
[20:51.070 --> 20:52.110]  He's doing the bleaching.
[20:52.530 --> 20:53.250]  Yeah, I mean...
[20:53.250 --> 20:57.210]  I just don't want it to be a bleach that you can get away with every day.
[20:57.630 --> 20:59.270]  I want it to be a horrific bleach.
[21:00.550 --> 21:00.930]  Oh, yeah.
[21:01.070 --> 21:06.110]  I mean, I think bleached hair at all right now is going to be a horrific bleach.
[21:06.530 --> 21:07.870]  It's not cool.
[21:07.870 --> 21:09.410]  And I'm almost 40.
[21:10.390 --> 21:12.150]  Yeah, I'll wear the hat next to that.
[21:12.230 --> 21:12.530]  Okay.
[21:13.050 --> 21:13.470]  Okay.
[21:18.710 --> 21:24.650]  Do you think by at this point, when the wardrobe or the person put Chevy Chase in that shirt, they already hated him?
[21:25.490 --> 21:25.950]  Absolutely.
[21:27.050 --> 21:30.510]  Like, that was a decision, right? That was like, this motherfucker. All right, fine.
[21:30.990 --> 21:34.570]  What if he was really nice before this movie and this movie changed him?
[21:34.930 --> 21:38.010]  I mean, I know that's not the case, but what if?
[21:38.730 --> 21:41.010]  Yeah, he's just saying more whimsical, warmer whimsical.
[21:41.290 --> 21:43.350]  And the prop guy's like, fuck you.
[21:43.550 --> 21:45.310]  And then he had a really bad attitude.
[21:45.470 --> 21:47.970]  I thought it was a shirt. It's an old-timey bathing suit.
[21:55.610 --> 21:57.010]  When did they go away?
[21:58.550 --> 22:00.890]  Yeah, when did we stop wearing old-timey bathing suits?
[22:01.770 --> 22:04.050]  Because I think we should bring one back to the store.
[22:04.490 --> 22:07.230]  I'm going to do bleached hair and an old-timey bathing suit.
[22:07.330 --> 22:09.730]  Gavin's going to wear his floppy hat. This is great.
[22:10.270 --> 22:13.350]  Beastie Bacon in the comments said, when we got new-timey.
[22:21.440 --> 22:22.660]  That tickled me.
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.620]  So there's no magic to the snow day.
[22:30.820 --> 22:35.040]  They didn't wish upon a star or a teddy bear or anything.
[22:35.280 --> 22:38.060]  She wished upon a snow globe. Like, she wanted it.
[22:38.340 --> 22:41.340]  I think it's magic in the same way The Secret is magic.
[22:41.720 --> 22:44.620]  Like, she definitely vocalized it.
[22:46.880 --> 22:49.300]  Get pelted, get pelted, get pelted, get pelted, get pelted.
[22:51.840 --> 22:54.340]  So this whole movie is based around snow?
[22:54.860 --> 22:56.340]  Yeah, this whole movie.
[22:56.640 --> 23:00.440]  What part of snow day did you think was, like, deceiving?
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.340]  No, I just mean they've used a lot of fake snow so far.
[23:06.490 --> 23:08.990]  Like, couldn't they have just... did they film it somewhere snowy?
[23:11.510 --> 23:14.050]  It does not... I bet they didn't.
[23:14.730 --> 23:17.430]  Right, which is mental for a movie based around snow.
[23:24.850 --> 23:26.290]  I was gonna laugh like that.
[23:27.990 --> 23:28.770]  Never mind.
[23:40.280 --> 23:43.240]  Goldie Hawn went to the premiere of Snow Day?
[23:43.880 --> 23:47.700]  Is, like, her kid in it or something? Is Wyatt Russell in this movie?
[23:47.720 --> 23:48.440]  Oh, no, that's not...
[23:48.440 --> 23:48.660]  Is that Wyatt Russell?
[23:48.780 --> 23:52.620]  That's not Goldie Hawn. It's just somebody that looked like her in a small picture.
[23:53.060 --> 23:54.260]  But Corbin Bernson did.
[23:55.340 --> 23:56.460]  Oh, Corbin Bernson?
[23:58.040 --> 24:03.440]  Man, the stack of pancakes that Josh just passed out next to looks so good.
[24:05.520 --> 24:07.720]  I know where the movie was filmed.
[24:08.280 --> 24:08.960]  Where was it filmed?
[24:10.380 --> 24:11.300]  Anybody want to take any guesses?
[24:12.880 --> 24:13.180]  California.
[24:13.640 --> 24:17.040]  I'll say upstate New York just to keep with where it is.
[24:18.140 --> 24:18.340]  Yeah?
[24:19.980 --> 24:20.980]  I'll agree with Eric.
[24:22.340 --> 24:22.740]  L.A.
[24:24.120 --> 24:29.640]  The 2000 movie Snow Day was filmed in Edmonton and Calgary as well as New York.
[24:29.840 --> 24:30.920]  So, Eric, you get partial credit.
[24:31.840 --> 24:34.220]  They were in Alberta as well? That's incredible.
[24:36.460 --> 24:36.840]  Damn.
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.800]  This narration's supposed to be, like, Christmas story-esque, I guess.
[24:48.420 --> 24:49.220]  Yeah, I think so.
[24:50.720 --> 24:51.540]  There he is.
[24:52.120 --> 24:54.060]  I don't know that I've seen him with a beard, really, before.
[24:55.920 --> 24:57.420]  We should watch Cabin Boy.
[24:58.780 --> 24:59.620]  Oh, man.
[25:14.630 --> 25:15.590]  His bird?
[25:15.930 --> 25:16.510]  Oh, my God!
[25:16.510 --> 25:17.670]  He's got a bird named Trudy!
[25:17.950 --> 25:20.790]  That's, like, the most evil-looking bird you can have, too.
[25:21.650 --> 25:22.370]  What was that?
[25:23.570 --> 25:24.630]  Like a raven?
[25:24.690 --> 25:25.870]  Yeah, like a raven, it seemed.
[25:26.370 --> 25:27.730]  Is that what a raven looks like?
[25:28.210 --> 25:29.150]  Dude, ravens are huge.
[25:32.350 --> 25:36.090]  What kind of bird is in Snow Day?
[25:36.370 --> 25:37.570]  That could be us and Snow Runners.
[25:37.950 --> 25:39.410]  A lot of people are saying that's a magpie.
[25:42.220 --> 25:43.720]  But they could all see each other.
[25:44.980 --> 25:45.520]  That's true.
[25:47.400 --> 25:50.040]  Trudy is a white snowbird? That bird was black.
[25:50.220 --> 25:51.020]  Oh, it's a pied crow.
[25:52.700 --> 25:53.200]  Pied?
[25:53.460 --> 25:54.680]  Pied crow.
[25:56.620 --> 25:57.800]  P-I-E-D.
[25:58.300 --> 25:58.900]  Pied crow.
[26:01.420 --> 26:02.420]  That means...
[26:02.420 --> 26:03.460]  What does pied mean?
[26:04.660 --> 26:05.080]  Bonner?
[26:07.080 --> 26:07.580]  Corvus?
[26:07.580 --> 26:08.320]  Matt Bonner?
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.420]  I was scared. I didn't want to say it because I thought I'd be stupid.
[26:12.300 --> 26:12.560]  What?
[26:13.420 --> 26:14.480]  It means two or more colors.
[26:15.520 --> 26:15.720]  Oh.
[26:17.340 --> 26:19.180]  I don't think I've ever heard that term before.
[26:19.740 --> 26:21.020]  Was the pied piper two colors?
[26:26.100 --> 26:29.080]  That would be so cool.
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.880]  His thing that they don't talk about is he's two-colored.
[26:32.240 --> 26:34.700]  But his name, that's nuts.
[26:40.730 --> 26:42.970]  He's like silver and black like the Raiders.
[26:43.290 --> 26:43.690]  Yeah.
[26:49.120 --> 26:54.500]  Is this kid like an idiot or what's going on?
[26:55.080 --> 26:56.640]  He really likes ice in his shoes.
[27:01.120 --> 27:02.720]  I'm going to get Jeff that troll doll.
[27:03.380 --> 27:05.700]  Surely going to go flying when she puts her foot down.
[27:06.280 --> 27:07.860]  You know what I don't ever see?
[27:08.620 --> 27:10.200]  Trolls when we go to bingo.
[27:10.200 --> 27:16.300]  In the movies or when it's referenced or TV shows people are always putting their trolls out for luck.
[27:16.400 --> 27:19.120]  We go to bingo all the time. I've never actually seen that.
[27:19.180 --> 27:21.800]  And I've seen some rough looking people at bingo.
[27:23.380 --> 27:24.420]  I've never heard of that.
[27:25.320 --> 27:26.880]  Yeah, it's like a good luck thing.
[27:28.680 --> 27:29.080]  Huh.
[27:30.660 --> 27:32.280]  I can't believe that garage door opened.
[27:35.740 --> 27:39.280]  That was my dream as a kid to open the garage and it would be filled with snow.
[27:39.280 --> 27:40.500]  On the other side.
[27:42.320 --> 27:43.200]  Never snowed that much.
[27:43.400 --> 27:43.800]  What would you do? Dive in?
[27:44.380 --> 27:45.100]  Oh, I would. Yeah.
[27:53.700 --> 27:54.480]  Oh my God.
[27:55.020 --> 27:55.480]  Oh God.
[27:55.760 --> 27:57.500]  Cold and coughed old ass.
[27:57.600 --> 27:58.500]  I know. I was about to say.
[27:58.860 --> 28:03.780]  I don't know if his mom or his dad bought him the thesaurus for Christmas, but I wish they would.
[28:04.120 --> 28:05.420]  I hope they fucking regret it.
[28:05.980 --> 28:09.180]  And as I walked around the city, I saw a bunch of phonies.
[28:09.380 --> 28:10.080]  Alright, go to hell.
[28:16.850 --> 28:20.250]  You strike me as the kind of person who wasn't a big fan of Catcher in the Rye, Andrew.
[28:20.270 --> 28:20.790]  Or Eric.
[28:21.310 --> 28:22.450]  Oh, I hated it.
[28:22.590 --> 28:23.650]  I'm reading it in high school.
[28:23.770 --> 28:26.270]  I was just like, guys, we cannot keep reading this book.
[28:26.350 --> 28:27.310]  This is miserable.
[28:27.690 --> 28:29.110]  I don't think we read that one.
[28:29.310 --> 28:30.510]  God, I hated it.
[28:30.570 --> 28:31.450]  I read it freshman year.
[28:31.590 --> 28:32.710]  I hated it so much.
[28:32.990 --> 28:33.570]  Fucking loved it.
[28:37.440 --> 28:38.740]  That doesn't surprise me.
[28:41.900 --> 28:43.620]  Yeah, I guess we are who we appear to be.
[28:44.080 --> 28:45.680]  Yeah, they were pretty.
[28:47.200 --> 28:49.880]  Not as not as deep as we assume we are.
[28:51.700 --> 28:52.720]  Pretty surface level.
[28:55.260 --> 28:57.720]  I'm not buying the snow on the roof of the house next door.
[29:13.820 --> 29:15.880]  Dude, you got some nice houses up in Canada, Andrew.
[29:16.280 --> 29:16.740]  Yeah, dude.
[29:27.120 --> 29:30.040]  Yeah, I don't know if this is Edmonton or Calgary.
[29:30.200 --> 29:31.420]  Probably Edmonton, I'd assume.
[29:32.340 --> 29:33.440]  Did you live in a house like this?
[29:34.140 --> 29:34.420]  No.
[29:36.800 --> 29:37.860]  What the fuck?
[29:39.200 --> 29:40.200]  He invented rough, Nick.
[29:41.440 --> 29:42.460]  I don't... okay.
[29:44.760 --> 29:46.520]  You should never shout that at kids.
[29:46.800 --> 29:47.260]  No.
[29:48.360 --> 29:51.140]  I think that was my primary problem with him saying it.
[29:59.120 --> 30:05.620]  Million dollars, but...
[30:06.600 --> 30:07.380]  Snowballs, man.
[30:07.400 --> 30:08.200]  I had a fun day that day.
[30:09.300 --> 30:11.020]  Just being in the main cast.
[30:26.740 --> 30:29.260]  I like everything about this movie except for the main character.
[30:39.400 --> 30:41.040]  He didn't like Empire Records, right?
[30:41.280 --> 30:41.700]  Right, Jeff?
[30:42.140 --> 30:43.380]  No, I hated that fucking movie.
[30:43.920 --> 30:44.220]  Got it.
[30:44.520 --> 30:46.260]  I hated it when it came out in the theater.
[30:46.520 --> 30:48.240]  I hated it when all my friends liked it.
[30:48.440 --> 30:50.700]  I hated it when everybody wanted to watch it at a fucking party.
[30:50.840 --> 30:52.200]  I hated it when my first wife liked it.
[30:52.260 --> 30:53.700]  I hated it when my second wife liked it.
[30:53.780 --> 30:56.020]  If my third wife likes it, I'll fucking hate it again.
[30:56.760 --> 30:57.840]  Which one is that one?
[30:58.960 --> 31:01.020]  It's from 90...
[31:01.020 --> 31:01.900]  I'm going to say 95.
[31:02.500 --> 31:03.380]  Is that the Lynn Tyler one?
[31:03.460 --> 31:04.040]  Yes, it is.
[31:06.300 --> 31:08.580]  It's the most insufferable fucking film.
[31:09.220 --> 31:10.460]  My wife showed that movie to me.
[31:11.140 --> 31:14.680]  It was such a movie that I saw when I was like 10 years old and I went,
[31:14.800 --> 31:16.640]  Oh my God, anything's possible.
[31:17.480 --> 31:19.000]  And then you watch it now and you go,
[31:19.240 --> 31:20.420]  This movie sucks.
[31:20.780 --> 31:23.180]  I saw it when I was 28, so I had a much different view.
[31:23.480 --> 31:25.680]  Step one, arrest the idiot and put him in jail.
[31:25.800 --> 31:26.420]  Movie over.
[31:26.600 --> 31:27.500]  He stole the money.
[31:27.720 --> 31:28.780]  Then we are done.
[31:28.840 --> 31:28.880]  He went to Vegas.
[31:28.960 --> 31:29.540]  The end. Goodbye.
[31:30.140 --> 31:34.020]  We don't dig him out of the fucking hole he put Anthony LaPaglia in.
[31:34.040 --> 31:39.320]  I thought it was so great.
[31:39.420 --> 31:42.180]  There's so many different characters and everyone's like a little stereotype thing.
[31:42.240 --> 31:43.420]  And you're just like, this is great.
[31:43.520 --> 31:44.980]  And then you watch it now and you go,
[31:45.080 --> 31:46.400]  Everyone's a fucking stereotype thing.
[31:46.440 --> 31:46.980]  This sucks.
[31:47.100 --> 31:49.860]  And you're like, oh, this is what it must be like to work at a record shop.
[31:50.240 --> 31:50.800]  Uh-huh.
[31:53.740 --> 31:55.420]  Well, it's open and there's more than one person.
[32:04.360 --> 32:06.800]  Have you been checking the driveways, Gavin, to see if anyone's dead?
[32:07.860 --> 32:08.480]  Any shots?
[32:08.900 --> 32:09.560]  No, I've not been looking.
[32:12.360 --> 32:12.760]  Whoa.
[32:13.420 --> 32:14.220]  Holy shit.
[32:14.260 --> 32:15.400]  That's so fucking cool.
[32:16.360 --> 32:17.080]  That's cool.
[32:19.060 --> 32:20.720]  How'd they get the power room in here?
[32:24.560 --> 32:26.080]  Josh Peck looks genuinely ill.
[32:27.720 --> 32:29.540]  That's which one it is, Josh Peck?
[32:29.620 --> 32:29.960]  Yeah.
[32:30.100 --> 32:33.640]  Did he have like a studio deal where he just got to be in everything?
[32:33.980 --> 32:34.460]  Dude, yes.
[32:34.600 --> 32:35.340]  He was like...
[32:35.340 --> 32:35.740]  Nickelodeon guy.
[32:36.500 --> 32:38.940]  They just rode that kid for as long as they could.
[32:39.220 --> 32:39.620]  Crazy.
[32:40.080 --> 32:40.880]  What's he doing now?
[32:40.880 --> 32:42.280]  Well, didn't he do one grown-up movie?
[32:42.900 --> 32:44.660]  No, he's in like a lot of stuff.
[32:46.420 --> 32:47.940]  He was in The Wackness.
[32:48.440 --> 32:49.400]  That's what I was thinking of.
[32:49.400 --> 32:50.160]  He was in The Wackness.
[32:50.640 --> 32:51.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[32:51.280 --> 32:52.120]  That's what I was thinking of.
[32:52.600 --> 32:52.840]  Yeah.
[32:53.780 --> 32:56.620]  I mean, he's probably just...
[32:56.620 --> 32:59.640]  Did he get real, like, Dan Schneider'd back in the day?
[33:00.720 --> 33:01.320]  Dan Schneider'd?
[33:01.320 --> 33:02.340]  I don't know what that means.
[33:02.540 --> 33:07.060]  I mean, like, probably, but I don't know if he was in that thing.
[33:07.280 --> 33:08.660]  No, he was in all that.
[33:09.080 --> 33:10.600]  So that was a Dan Schneider thing.
[33:12.000 --> 33:13.960]  Oh, Drake did, according to chat.
[33:15.140 --> 33:15.520]  Rough.
[33:16.980 --> 33:18.160]  He was in Oppenheimer.
[33:19.300 --> 33:19.920]  He was?
[33:20.140 --> 33:20.860]  Which one? Josh Peck?
[33:21.360 --> 33:21.560]  Yeah.
[33:21.900 --> 33:22.200]  Oh.
[33:22.580 --> 33:22.960]  What?
[33:23.100 --> 33:24.260]  Yeah, he was looking at the explosion.
[33:24.960 --> 33:25.080]  Yeah.
[33:25.740 --> 33:27.420]  Oh, I had something like that as a kid.
[33:27.520 --> 33:29.820]  Dude, periscopes were the shit when I was a kid.
[33:29.840 --> 33:30.180]  They were so cool.
[33:30.400 --> 33:30.580]  I loved them.
[33:30.980 --> 33:32.240]  I don't think I ever owned one.
[33:33.540 --> 33:34.840]  And they worked the other way, too.
[33:35.000 --> 33:35.720]  So cool.
[33:37.180 --> 33:39.020]  Did you get to use one in the army?
[33:39.900 --> 33:41.480]  No, I was in the army, not the Navy.
[33:42.060 --> 33:42.480]  Yeah.
[33:46.260 --> 33:47.520]  He had to dig a foxhole.
[33:47.660 --> 33:47.900]  Yeah.
[33:49.580 --> 33:51.440]  How big could a periscope be?
[33:52.560 --> 33:55.860]  If I wanted to see something, my drill sergeant would just say,
[33:55.980 --> 33:57.520]  Open your eyes, jackass.
[33:59.100 --> 34:00.840]  And that's the word he would use, right?
[34:00.980 --> 34:01.060]  I heard that a lot.
[34:01.060 --> 34:02.480]  He would use jackass?
[34:02.540 --> 34:04.680]  No, that is a direct quote.
[34:05.640 --> 34:08.140]  I mean, he would use other words that I can't say on the podcast,
[34:08.520 --> 34:11.080]  but in this instance, jackass is a direct quote.
[34:11.080 --> 34:12.180]  Open your eyes, jackass.
[34:13.540 --> 34:16.000]  Do you think that was a snow donut or a snow bagel?
[34:17.860 --> 34:18.540]  Great question.
[34:18.840 --> 34:19.900]  That's a great question.
[34:20.360 --> 34:20.780]  Beautiful.
[34:30.540 --> 34:34.540]  Snow always looked real nice until traffic had gone through it, you know?
[34:34.540 --> 34:36.960]  Oh yeah, it looked so gross after that.
[34:37.160 --> 34:38.840]  I don't know.
[34:39.280 --> 34:41.140]  I don't know at all.
[34:41.340 --> 34:43.960]  Chad says Josh Peck is cute as fuck now.
[34:44.780 --> 34:45.160]  Oh really?
[34:45.340 --> 34:45.620]  Good to know.
[34:45.880 --> 34:46.420]  Hell yeah!
[34:46.420 --> 34:51.120]  I think he's like the main love interest in How I Met Your Father with Hilary Duff.
[34:51.260 --> 34:51.840]  I don't know what that is.
[34:52.160 --> 34:53.760]  I forgot about that show.
[34:53.860 --> 34:54.780]  Everyone did.
[34:55.480 --> 34:57.060]  Is it related in any way?
[34:58.200 --> 34:58.860]  Oh, I have no idea.
[34:59.240 --> 35:00.900]  I didn't watch it, I just know about it.
[35:01.600 --> 35:04.940]  I watched like the first episode and I was like, this is some shit.
[35:05.180 --> 35:07.280]  I feel like it's on Hulu and I don't have Hulu.
[35:08.860 --> 35:12.060]  I only have Hulu because it's part of the Disney ESPN Plus package.
[35:12.060 --> 35:12.620]  Mmm.
[35:17.720 --> 35:19.660]  Alright, 57-54 at the half.
[35:20.720 --> 35:21.620]  You think his bud's dead?
[35:23.040 --> 35:23.820]  It's gonna fly out.
[35:24.020 --> 35:26.060]  Oh, it should have flown out right there.
[35:26.400 --> 35:28.680]  It should have flown out the top and started attacking the kids.
[35:30.560 --> 35:31.420]  Jeff, who are they playing?
[35:32.420 --> 35:32.820]  Bulls.
[35:33.960 --> 35:35.500]  I mean, I don't know what you're talking about.
[35:36.480 --> 35:37.380]  Spurs are playing the Hawks.
[35:37.600 --> 35:39.320]  I mean, possibly.
[35:39.460 --> 35:39.960]  Are they in Atlanta?
[35:41.100 --> 35:42.480]  No, they're in San Antonio.
[35:44.760 --> 35:46.420]  He had his Josh Pecker out.
[35:53.460 --> 35:55.160]  Yeah, stay on the porch!
[35:56.220 --> 35:58.540]  Actually, this guy's not just doing his job.
[35:59.620 --> 36:02.080]  Okay, well, listen, I saw five minutes of it.
[36:03.060 --> 36:05.560]  He's looking at a kid's ass while he's chasing him.
[36:05.840 --> 36:08.840]  To be fair, to this point, all he's done is plow roads.
[36:09.860 --> 36:12.360]  And he's an evil bird. I love his evil bird.
[36:12.360 --> 36:15.360]  They built this whole tunnel system today, right?
[36:15.860 --> 36:16.020]  Yeah.
[36:17.740 --> 36:18.600]  They're skilled.
[36:21.300 --> 36:23.740]  You know a kid would give up ten seconds into that.
[36:24.180 --> 36:24.940]  Nice fart.
[36:26.240 --> 36:27.080]  Fill up a balloon.
[36:30.870 --> 36:31.330]  Oh no!
[36:31.530 --> 36:32.310]  Not the CRT!
[36:34.490 --> 36:35.690]  Mom's gonna be pissed.
[36:38.950 --> 36:39.730]  How's the bird?
[36:40.290 --> 36:40.990]  Yeah, it's evil!
[36:40.990 --> 36:46.390]  I will say, I guess from his perspective, he just murdered three kids and it's pretty okay about it.
[36:46.450 --> 36:47.110]  Yeah, he's fine with it.
[36:51.110 --> 36:52.970]  Why did they build the fort in the road?
[36:53.170 --> 36:53.230]  Holy shit!
[36:53.270 --> 36:53.730]  That's a good question.
[36:53.770 --> 36:54.490]  Is that Chili?
[37:00.010 --> 37:01.590]  It's Chili from TLC.
[37:02.090 --> 37:02.610]  Is it?
[37:03.230 --> 37:03.630]  Yes.
[37:04.970 --> 37:06.170]  Isn't she dead?
[37:06.870 --> 37:09.030]  No, that's Lisa Left Eye.
[37:09.570 --> 37:11.370]  Remember, she was in like a bunch of movies.
[37:11.370 --> 37:14.450]  Isn't she in like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream or some stuff?
[37:14.510 --> 37:15.430]  She's in like stuff.
[37:15.650 --> 37:18.290]  She, I think maybe Scream 3.
[37:19.290 --> 37:23.830]  There was a, there were like probably like half a decade where it's like she's gonna be an actor now.
[37:24.290 --> 37:27.070]  Well, it was her and Kelly Rowland was doing the same stuff around the same time.
[37:27.190 --> 37:27.230]  Yes.
[37:27.230 --> 37:29.370]  Like she was in Freddy vs. Jason, I think.
[37:30.290 --> 37:30.590]  Yep.
[37:34.830 --> 37:37.250]  Oh my god, my son talks just like this.
[37:39.510 --> 37:41.890]  Does he slam his head into the wall in a lunchbox?
[37:42.790 --> 37:44.170]  I fucking hope not.
[37:44.370 --> 37:45.750]  Hand him a lunchbox, let's find out.
[37:46.830 --> 37:49.290]  He'll be like, what's this? Smash, smash, smash.
[37:49.410 --> 37:51.030]  It's one of the movies she's known for.
[37:51.790 --> 37:52.510]  What is?
[37:52.830 --> 37:53.230]  Snow Day.
[37:54.590 --> 37:55.210]  Who, Chili?
[37:55.670 --> 37:55.910]  Yeah.
[37:56.590 --> 37:57.070]  Oh, bummer.
[37:57.770 --> 37:58.010]  It's highlighted.
[37:58.350 --> 37:59.590]  What's the third one in TLC?
[38:00.870 --> 38:01.230]  T-Bone.
[38:01.650 --> 38:01.950]  T-Boz.
[38:01.950 --> 38:02.570]  T-Boz.
[38:02.610 --> 38:03.710]  T-Boz.
[38:03.810 --> 38:06.930]  T-Boz, Left Eye and Chili.
[38:09.350 --> 38:11.010]  Their names made up TLC?
[38:11.010 --> 38:11.770]  Yeah.
[38:12.530 --> 38:13.070]  Crazy.
[38:13.330 --> 38:13.470]  What?
[38:14.250 --> 38:14.770]  Really?
[38:15.070 --> 38:15.990]  That's what TLC was, yeah.
[38:16.490 --> 38:16.690]  Yeah.
[38:17.050 --> 38:17.470]  Wow.
[38:18.810 --> 38:21.510]  Are you learning that for the first time right now?
[38:22.570 --> 38:23.290]  Yeah, I am.
[38:24.290 --> 38:26.870]  I thought that was very common knowledge.
[38:28.070 --> 38:29.890]  Maybe we're just a little older.
[38:30.530 --> 38:34.550]  I mean, I had Crazy Sexy Cool on cassette, so yeah, definitely.
[38:36.570 --> 38:37.730]  Did they have a logo?
[38:37.730 --> 38:43.850]  I imagine it would be a T and an L within a C, but I don't remember.
[38:44.790 --> 38:47.610]  I wonder if we could do an aneg one in the style of the TLC logo.
[38:47.970 --> 38:48.870]  Oh, that's cool.
[38:49.890 --> 38:50.610]  Not real...
[38:50.610 --> 38:53.790]  Okay, so there is one that I sort of remember where it is just...
[38:55.030 --> 38:56.830]  I guess I could put it in...
[38:56.830 --> 38:58.310]  I can put it in this, I guess.
[38:58.410 --> 39:01.290]  If you search for TLC logo, you get the TLC TV show.
[39:02.130 --> 39:02.310]  Yeah.
[39:02.770 --> 39:03.930]  I just put it in chat.
[39:03.930 --> 39:09.310]  That's what I mostly remember is the TLC with the boxes around it.
[39:10.090 --> 39:13.550]  I don't know why we would want to do that, but we could, yes.
[39:13.550 --> 39:14.210]  That looks real ugly.
[39:14.910 --> 39:15.810]  That's hideous.
[39:21.830 --> 39:25.810]  The principal reminds me of the dad from Modern Family.
[39:28.090 --> 39:29.410]  Is it the chin?
[39:30.270 --> 39:32.650]  Yeah, I think it's the chin and the dark hair, I think.
[39:33.670 --> 39:35.530]  Is that Eliza Dushku?
[39:36.130 --> 39:36.570]  No.
[39:36.950 --> 39:37.150]  No.
[39:37.410 --> 39:38.790]  It looks like a person from Entourage.
[39:39.390 --> 39:40.530]  It is Sloane from Entourage.
[39:40.810 --> 39:43.670]  And there are so many people brushing their teeth in this movie.
[39:45.230 --> 39:45.670]  Huh.
[39:45.910 --> 39:46.350]  That's weird.
[39:46.590 --> 39:48.230]  Yeah, a lot of people are brushing their teeth.
[39:49.090 --> 39:49.290]  What?
[39:49.690 --> 39:51.910]  But what about the beginning where he goes, oh, yeah!
[39:52.610 --> 39:53.610]  No, I don't know what that is.
[39:54.290 --> 39:55.670]  I want to be your superhero!
[39:57.890 --> 39:58.770]  Emmanuelle Chiriqui.
[40:00.230 --> 40:00.510]  Is that her?
[40:01.230 --> 40:03.170]  Is that the actress's name?
[40:03.430 --> 40:04.350]  Yeah, Sloane.
[40:05.530 --> 40:06.830]  I'm just trying to see if I've seen her in anything else.
[40:07.370 --> 40:07.610]  Oh!
[40:15.380 --> 40:17.180]  Holy shit, she's been in a lot of stuff.
[40:18.980 --> 40:20.000]  Working actress, baby!
[40:20.480 --> 40:22.040]  Oh, wow, she was in Detroit Rock City.
[40:22.220 --> 40:23.840]  You can have an Eric Badour House of Pain, Eric, when you bleach your hair.
[40:24.620 --> 40:25.600]  Hell, goddamn right!
[40:27.200 --> 40:29.380]  And then Gavin puts on his floppy hat? That's awesome.
[40:30.000 --> 40:30.720]  Claire Bear.
[40:32.600 --> 40:34.920]  Hats really hurt my hair. I hate wearing them.
[40:35.320 --> 40:37.040]  No, this one's floppy, so maybe it's okay.
[40:37.160 --> 40:39.680]  Dude, she was in Call of Duty Black Ops.
[40:40.360 --> 40:40.840]  Cool!
[40:41.520 --> 40:42.400]  Yeah, she played a voice.
[40:43.140 --> 40:43.860]  That's cool.
[40:49.750 --> 40:55.330]  She strikes me as an actress who would be in 200 Cigarettes, but probably isn't in 200 Cigarettes.
[40:55.690 --> 41:00.710]  You know what I mean? I don't think the age works for when that movie came out, but I think I'm close.
[41:09.830 --> 41:10.570]  Fuck that.
[41:12.570 --> 41:14.190]  I don't think I've ever wanted to wear pants.
[41:14.730 --> 41:15.230]  That's been me.
[41:16.030 --> 41:16.450]  Oh, yeah.
[41:31.650 --> 41:33.730]  This guy sucks. He's awesome.
[41:34.130 --> 41:38.450]  I'm gonna dress like this. I'm gonna buy that shirt and that vest. This is awesome.
[41:40.530 --> 41:46.170]  When I was in like 8th grade, that was how everyone looked on TV.
[41:50.730 --> 41:53.610]  This is really like a time machine here.
[41:53.910 --> 41:55.010]  This is a Nickelodeon movie, huh?
[41:55.890 --> 41:57.350]  I was about to say the same thing.
[41:59.270 --> 42:01.030]  Somebody in the chat says she's 25.
[42:01.030 --> 42:02.810]  Still, it's a Nickelodeon movie, right?
[42:02.810 --> 42:04.470]  So she would have been in 200 Cigarettes.
[42:08.190 --> 42:11.150]  Still seems a little risque for Nickelodeon.
[42:11.770 --> 42:12.810]  Hello. Hello.
[42:17.240 --> 42:19.000]  Well, Chevy Chase is in it, so, you know.
[42:19.240 --> 42:19.480]  Yeah.
[42:21.020 --> 42:22.780]  Could go anywhere from here.
[42:26.520 --> 42:27.000]  Awesome.
[42:28.120 --> 42:33.100]  When have we seen Chevy Chase go down a sled?
[42:33.100 --> 42:33.980]  Christmas vacation?
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.240]  No, it wasn't Christmas vacation.
[42:36.780 --> 42:38.420]  That was a bin lid, wasn't it?
[42:38.720 --> 42:39.280]  It was, yeah.
[42:40.200 --> 42:42.040]  I assume this is an homage.
[42:44.800 --> 42:45.880]  Is this Smash Mouth?
[42:46.460 --> 42:47.340]  Yeah, it sure is.
[42:49.160 --> 42:50.620]  Oh, you had this soundtrack, right?
[42:51.160 --> 42:51.560]  Mm-hmm.
[42:54.020 --> 43:03.960]  So this came out in 2000, so this is off of their hit album Astro Lounge, which is the sequel, the follow-up to the hit album Fush You Meng.
[43:04.980 --> 43:06.380]  Big Smash Mouth head, baby.
[43:07.300 --> 43:09.040]  Whoa, this is a bulgy move.
[43:10.180 --> 43:10.920]  That dude's dead, right?
[43:12.640 --> 43:13.900]  Is he? The guy from Smash Mouth?
[43:14.140 --> 43:15.120]  Yeah, didn't he just die?
[43:15.820 --> 43:15.940]  Yeah.
[43:17.380 --> 43:18.100]  Oh, bummer.
[43:18.800 --> 43:21.260]  Oh, he did. Everyone threw bread at him and then he died or whatever, right?
[43:22.300 --> 43:23.500]  I think they threw bread at him.
[43:24.120 --> 43:24.280]  Yeah.
[43:25.620 --> 43:26.880]  Yeah, it was a little while ago.
[43:27.700 --> 43:27.900]  Yep.
[43:29.060 --> 43:32.140]  And then somethingawful.com told him to eat the eggs.
[43:33.980 --> 43:34.760]  I forgot.
[43:35.900 --> 43:37.620]  Smash Mouth, eat the eggs.
[43:37.960 --> 43:39.020]  It was the best.
[43:40.280 --> 43:44.080]  I made this advice article. I'm going to post a link to it.
[43:47.880 --> 43:48.760]  It's titled...
[43:48.760 --> 43:49.080]  What?
[43:50.160 --> 43:54.080]  Oh, man. The link goes to a different thing that says, in the club, whatever.
[43:54.340 --> 43:57.240]  It's, I made the Smash Mouth guy eat a shit ton of eggs.
[44:00.040 --> 44:01.100]  Oh, that's so cool.
[44:16.740 --> 44:17.620]  Uh-oh.
[44:17.820 --> 44:18.960]  Oh, no.
[44:24.780 --> 44:25.580]  I'll kill you.
[44:26.980 --> 44:28.260]  That's what that dude looks like.
[44:30.000 --> 44:35.640]  The premise that you give a fuck who was at the storm first as a weather guy, I just want you to tell me what it's going to do.
[44:35.860 --> 44:44.460]  But, like, that's a, like, trope in things where people are, like, mad at the weather guy or the weather guy needs to be the most accurate or whatever.
[44:44.720 --> 44:47.860]  So, a very easy thing for, like, a sixth grader to understand.
[44:47.860 --> 44:55.400]  Wasn't that, like, a, didn't that, wasn't that the weather man plot with Nick Cage? He was, like, a single dad.
[44:55.700 --> 45:02.260]  Yeah, and then he kept trying to give a speech about how his dad reminds him of Bob Seger's Like a Rock, I think.
[45:02.300 --> 45:02.500]  Yeah.
[45:02.680 --> 45:03.600]  That's a movie? That's pretty good.
[45:04.720 --> 45:06.720]  You mean the Chevy car commercial in Texas?
[45:08.640 --> 45:09.840]  Oh, Like a Rock.
[45:14.170 --> 45:14.570]  This...
[45:15.330 --> 45:16.150]  This is weird.
[45:16.150 --> 45:19.300]  This movie from the year 2000 has all the hits of 1998.
[45:20.150 --> 45:21.150]  Yeah, this is...
[45:28.950 --> 45:31.090]  Do you think one of those is as fun as a jet ski?
[45:32.970 --> 45:34.050]  Uh, yes.
[45:35.890 --> 45:36.970]  I've done both.
[45:37.590 --> 45:38.250]  Oh, really?
[45:38.350 --> 45:41.590]  I hurt myself pretty badly on a snowmobile.
[45:42.690 --> 45:42.890]  What?
[45:43.370 --> 45:43.770]  Yeah.
[45:43.930 --> 45:44.090]  What?
[45:44.810 --> 45:46.490]  Water's softer than snow.
[45:47.110 --> 45:48.330]  What are they doing?
[45:50.150 --> 45:52.610]  Dude, I hit a... I was going like...
[45:53.510 --> 45:56.290]  45 on a snowmobile in upstate New York.
[45:56.290 --> 45:56.350]  Oh, my God!
[45:56.490 --> 45:59.790]  Just through the woods and I hit a fucking little jump and went airborne.
[46:00.310 --> 46:00.590]  Oh, no!
[46:00.590 --> 46:06.050]  And the thing, when it hit the ground, it, like, dug in and, like, fucking ripped my leg out from under me.
[46:06.070 --> 46:07.930]  I had to go to the emergency room. It was a whole thing.
[46:08.110 --> 46:09.130]  Holy shit!
[46:09.930 --> 46:10.570]  It just...
[46:10.570 --> 46:12.030]  It just bruised the shit out of me.
[46:12.730 --> 46:14.290]  I never knew about that. That's crazy, dude.
[46:16.170 --> 46:17.530]  It was a lot of fun until that moment.
[46:17.530 --> 46:18.430]  Yeah.
[46:18.750 --> 46:20.590]  Chris Elliot's like, didn't I kill this kid?
[46:21.470 --> 46:22.390]  Do it again.
[46:23.570 --> 46:24.670]  Two if it's true.
[46:29.050 --> 46:32.730]  It's weird that they never pan down to the mound of bird shit right below.
[46:35.670 --> 46:38.030]  Is that true? A snowmobile killed Ken Block?
[46:39.010 --> 46:39.990]  Yeah, I think so.
[46:40.670 --> 46:41.270]  Oh, fuck.
[46:46.930 --> 46:49.310]  This dude believes in the double tap method.
[46:50.790 --> 46:52.690]  Are they gonna steal this guy's bird?
[46:58.870 --> 46:59.770]  Oh, I...
[47:00.830 --> 47:02.610]  I remember this scene.
[47:03.390 --> 47:03.750]  Do you really?
[47:04.170 --> 47:04.490]  Yeah.
[47:05.070 --> 47:07.230]  This kid just farts like crazy.
[47:09.590 --> 47:10.770]  Another kid trope.
[47:21.220 --> 47:22.780]  Oh, that's... weird.
[47:31.290 --> 47:33.050]  Gonna dip it in the ketchup.
[47:33.950 --> 47:36.510]  Those fries have to be so cold.
[47:36.890 --> 47:37.490]  Oh, they look...
[47:37.490 --> 47:38.650]  Look at how floppy it is.
[47:38.650 --> 47:40.850]  Oh, they're so floppy.
[47:44.450 --> 47:45.610]  Just doing his job.
[47:46.610 --> 47:49.830]  I gotta be honest, he seems like the kind of guy that would eat cold fries.
[47:50.650 --> 47:50.890]  Yeah.
[47:52.630 --> 47:53.030]  Now...
[47:53.030 --> 47:54.690]  Does he know it's ketchup?
[47:54.930 --> 47:59.730]  I mean, after the first bite, yeah, but...
[47:59.730 --> 48:03.430]  Well, he stepped on it and he farted, so he knows it's...
[48:06.720 --> 48:08.360]  That bird could rip her eyes out.
[48:15.040 --> 48:16.220]  I'd be afraid of the bird, too.
[48:16.280 --> 48:17.000]  It's a scary-ass bird.
[48:19.660 --> 48:21.140]  What is going on?
[48:21.240 --> 48:22.040]  What is happening?
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.100]  He's making, like, a chess poutine.
[48:37.140 --> 48:38.080]  No, not the bird.
[48:44.400 --> 48:45.640]  Yeah, you're doing your job.
[48:45.700 --> 48:46.160]  You suck.
[48:46.320 --> 48:46.720]  Fuck you.
[48:47.120 --> 48:49.480]  We've stolen your only friend.
[48:53.910 --> 48:54.790]  Oh, no.
[48:55.670 --> 48:56.770]  I have a hostage.
[48:58.170 --> 49:00.690]  Is he still laying there like a dipshit?
[49:01.210 --> 49:02.470]  What a moron.
[49:02.830 --> 49:07.590]  What a buffoon.
[49:11.010 --> 49:12.090]  Oh, my God.
[49:12.650 --> 49:14.150]  Oh, the fart knocked him over.
[49:16.110 --> 49:20.630]  I was about to compare that sequence to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but never mind.
[49:24.130 --> 49:25.550]  Josh Peck is his new bird.
[49:25.630 --> 49:26.530]  That's funny, Beastie Baker.
[49:28.570 --> 49:30.270]  Your name's Trudy now.
[49:43.060 --> 49:44.460]  Is that Iggy Pop?
[49:44.640 --> 49:45.440]  What the fuck?
[49:45.660 --> 49:46.980]  Absolutely Iggy Pop.
[49:47.740 --> 49:48.180]  Wow.
[49:48.400 --> 49:48.740]  What?
[49:50.520 --> 49:51.740]  This movie has everything.
[49:51.860 --> 49:54.040]  Gavin, you and I went ice skating together not too long ago.
[49:55.080 --> 49:56.120]  Yeah, it was pretty romantic.
[49:56.340 --> 49:56.520]  Did you see Iggy Pop, though?
[49:56.960 --> 49:57.220]  No.
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.720]  We did see somebody get carted off covered in blood.
[50:01.160 --> 50:01.660]  That's true.
[50:02.680 --> 50:04.240]  Wasn't that right before we went on as well?
[50:04.480 --> 50:04.720]  Yeah.
[50:04.980 --> 50:07.320]  They had to have a break to clean the blood off.
[50:14.680 --> 50:17.420]  He's in the Adventures of Pete and Pete.
[50:18.480 --> 50:19.540]  He's in this.
[50:19.860 --> 50:20.160]  Uh-oh.
[50:20.460 --> 50:21.720]  What else is he...
[50:22.380 --> 50:24.500]  Why is he in a bunch of Nickelodeon stuff?
[50:26.140 --> 50:27.040]  That's a good question.
[50:30.560 --> 50:31.000]  Jesus.
[50:31.000 --> 50:31.160]  Jesus.
[50:31.640 --> 50:51.370]  I don't think so.
[50:54.430 --> 50:54.990]  What?
[50:57.330 --> 50:58.790]  Is that his favorite animal?
[51:21.070 --> 51:23.050]  Why is he wearing...
[51:23.050 --> 51:25.910]  This is like the worst sweater with his little back brace.
[51:26.450 --> 51:27.270]  On the rocks.
[51:43.770 --> 51:45.170]  Wow, three years?
[51:45.290 --> 51:45.690]  Come on, man.
[51:48.430 --> 51:49.270]  Amateur hour.
[52:03.740 --> 52:15.850]  It was...
[52:15.850 --> 52:17.390]  We're just watching the movie.
[52:19.270 --> 52:20.730]  Like something's actually happening.
[52:20.730 --> 52:21.310]  I was invested.
[52:21.850 --> 52:23.370]  Yeah, like something's actually happening.
[52:23.470 --> 52:24.510]  We're just watching the movie.
[52:24.690 --> 52:25.770]  Iggy Pop pulled us in.
[52:26.110 --> 52:26.330]  Yup.
[52:26.790 --> 52:27.990]  I was thinking about gum flavors.
[52:28.810 --> 52:31.270]  His hair just completely shifted between those scenes.
[52:31.890 --> 52:32.730]  I like wintergreen.
[52:33.250 --> 52:34.190]  Say that again, please?
[52:34.530 --> 52:35.530]  I like wintergreen.
[52:35.590 --> 52:37.970]  That is like the most boring flavor of gum ever.
[52:39.890 --> 52:40.690]  Or peppermint.
[52:40.790 --> 52:41.410]  I mean, I don't mean to...
[52:41.410 --> 52:41.990]  Oh my god.
[52:42.090 --> 52:43.790]  Just fucking...
[52:43.790 --> 52:44.930]  All the bottom of the barrels.
[52:45.070 --> 52:45.250]  Okay.
[52:45.590 --> 52:46.710]  Naming mild flavors.
[52:47.050 --> 52:47.290]  Yeah.
[52:47.690 --> 52:48.750]  As opposed to what?
[52:48.950 --> 52:50.070]  I don't know, like...
[52:50.070 --> 52:52.490]  Hubba Bubba Strawberry Watermelon?
[52:53.090 --> 52:55.450]  Yeah, but all that stuff runs out of flavor too fast.
[52:56.090 --> 52:56.690]  Yeah, but it had it.
[52:56.770 --> 52:58.490]  It had flavor for a little while.
[52:58.910 --> 53:00.170]  Yeah, for ten seconds, man.
[53:00.450 --> 53:04.810]  What if you had little like gum top-ups where you could pour some flavor on and put it back in?
[53:05.030 --> 53:05.730]  Ooh, Reflave?
[53:07.150 --> 53:08.730]  If you're talking Reflave, I'm in.
[53:15.410 --> 53:16.580]  Oh, he's going in the toilet.
[53:16.580 --> 53:17.320]  Don't touch the toilet seat.
[53:17.500 --> 53:17.920]  Jesus.
[53:18.680 --> 53:19.540]  He's a lefty.
[53:19.720 --> 53:20.100]  Oh!
[53:22.200 --> 53:23.120]  That's awesome.
[53:23.580 --> 53:23.860]  For God's sake.
[53:25.220 --> 53:25.800]  Dude.
[53:26.280 --> 53:27.120]  It is his butt.
[53:28.740 --> 53:31.120]  Coffee and cigarettes came out after this.
[53:31.920 --> 53:32.840]  Did it really?
[53:33.280 --> 53:33.680]  Yeah.
[53:34.100 --> 53:36.540]  Coffee and cigarettes didn't come out until like 2004?
[53:37.280 --> 53:38.160]  I guess so.
[53:38.540 --> 53:38.780]  2002?
[53:39.360 --> 53:39.840]  2003?
[53:40.060 --> 53:40.420]  Something like that?
[53:40.540 --> 53:41.180]  I guess so.
[53:41.180 --> 53:44.860]  I thought you meant the drink and the smoke.
[53:45.240 --> 53:46.480]  Nope, those came out way before.
[53:47.180 --> 53:47.200]  Nice.
[53:49.880 --> 53:59.520]  I'm talking to Nick on the Michael Jordan podcast about what he misses about smoking, and it was just having a cup of coffee with a cigarette standing at the door of the back porch with the door open.
[53:59.940 --> 54:03.000]  I was like, oh my God, this is like the realest thing I've ever heard.
[54:03.380 --> 54:04.320]  Oh, so real.
[54:05.480 --> 54:06.440]  I'm just a cold morning.
[54:06.740 --> 54:07.420]  Ben Affleck picture.
[54:08.380 --> 54:11.100]  Yeah, it's that, but like less sad.
[54:11.180 --> 54:13.060]  It's him, but 20 years younger.
[54:13.680 --> 54:14.920]  With no money.
[54:15.060 --> 54:17.460]  What's everybody's favorite Jim Jarmusch film?
[54:20.860 --> 54:24.060]  I mean, coffee and cigarettes.
[54:26.340 --> 54:27.280]  It's a good one.
[54:29.260 --> 54:31.880]  It's definitely not the Dead Don't Die or whatever.
[54:32.280 --> 54:34.020]  I was gonna say, didn't he do a zombie one recently?
[54:34.020 --> 54:34.340]  He did.
[54:35.460 --> 54:38.340]  It's not like it sucked, but it's not very good.
[54:38.720 --> 54:39.160]  Is that him?
[54:39.600 --> 54:40.280]  What's that?
[54:40.280 --> 54:41.520]  Broken flowers?
[54:43.020 --> 54:43.380]  Maybe?
[54:44.020 --> 54:45.200]  I know he made Ghost Dog.
[54:45.660 --> 54:47.760]  Yeah, that's my favorite Ghost Dog way of the samurai.
[54:48.180 --> 54:50.260]  A lot of people like Dead Man, but I'm a Ghost Dog guy.
[55:02.820 --> 55:04.380]  You see his little arm back there?
[55:12.100 --> 55:12.460]  Pleh.
[55:14.100 --> 55:14.640]  Damn it.
[55:25.830 --> 55:31.670]  You think, I don't know if they were single at the time, but do you think there's any chance that Chris Elliott and Gene Smart hooked up on the set?
[55:32.430 --> 55:33.090]  Yeah, hell yeah.
[55:33.090 --> 55:33.710]  That's awesome.
[55:33.910 --> 55:34.890]  I like thinking about that.
[55:34.930 --> 55:35.670]  That's cool.
[55:36.130 --> 55:37.310]  There goes Andrew again.
[55:42.410 --> 55:45.130]  That guy was really afraid of the blue kid.
[55:46.250 --> 55:48.890]  I would be alarmed by the blue kid in his position.
[55:52.940 --> 55:54.540]  Is he gonna answer the phone?
[55:55.160 --> 55:56.440]  This is insane.
[55:56.660 --> 55:57.940]  What kind of turn...
[55:57.940 --> 56:00.940]  Go back to the thing we were all watching and sort of invested in.
[56:01.700 --> 56:02.640]  The love story?
[56:02.640 --> 56:06.760]  Yeah, like for some reason that was like at least gripping to us. This is just absurd.
[56:07.660 --> 56:09.520]  Does he have leather mittens on?
[56:09.920 --> 56:10.560]  He does.
[56:11.640 --> 56:12.520]  That's awesome.
[56:12.940 --> 56:13.860]  Oh no, the evil bird!
[56:17.600 --> 56:18.220]  What's this?
[56:27.720 --> 56:30.520]  So he decides on the snow day by not plowing?
[56:30.740 --> 56:31.920]  He's too efficient, yeah.
[56:34.020 --> 56:35.380]  Oh, he's Mr. Plow.
[56:35.800 --> 56:36.580]  That's his name.
[56:37.220 --> 56:38.640]  That name again is Mr. Plow.
[56:39.780 --> 56:40.680]  That was funny, Nick.
[56:43.600 --> 56:44.360]  It was!
[56:45.140 --> 56:47.140]  I was just really laughing, but I appreciated it.
[56:47.220 --> 56:51.280]  This is the guy who was wearing the floppy hat, but now he's just doing french fry stuff.
[56:51.660 --> 56:53.540]  Is he doing some like close encounters shit?
[56:53.820 --> 56:56.620]  I thought he was going to, but he's just being a dipshit.
[56:56.980 --> 57:00.880]  Is he the one you said looks like he was in Empire Records?
[57:02.360 --> 57:04.900]  I think everyone just sort of has that look, but yes.
[57:06.140 --> 57:07.840]  Does his hat say dub or club?
[57:08.520 --> 57:09.100]  Oh, I don't know.
[57:09.540 --> 57:09.720]  Dub.
[57:10.740 --> 57:12.140]  I gotta get a dub hat.
[57:21.300 --> 57:24.920]  He's just holding a real fucking bird.
[57:25.400 --> 57:26.560]  This is crazy.
[57:27.020 --> 57:28.600]  He's literally just like tied to his arm.
[57:28.940 --> 57:30.000]  What the fuck?
[57:31.480 --> 57:33.320]  That poor fucking bird.
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.660]  The bird's like, I hate the cold, I hate the cold, I hate the cold.
[57:40.720 --> 57:42.500]  Oh, Geoff, you posted a dub hat?
[57:42.660 --> 57:43.360]  I found a dub hat.
[57:43.760 --> 57:44.240]  Nice!
[57:48.270 --> 57:49.090]  Oh shit.
[57:50.510 --> 57:52.730]  It's like Jaws, but with a truck.
[57:57.600 --> 57:59.100]  Man, that is a pied bird.
[58:01.660 --> 58:02.800]  Oh my god.
[58:03.640 --> 58:04.600]  Holy shit.
[58:12.600 --> 58:13.900]  Okay, holy shit.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.960]  Look at his single-looking ass strapped to the front.
[58:17.280 --> 58:20.880]  The fucking B-story to this movie is so much better than the A-story.
[58:21.500 --> 58:24.620]  He's like crucified into the front of the ketchup stains.
[58:32.730 --> 58:33.650]  Who's that girl?
[58:33.830 --> 58:35.350]  She's in a lot of 90s stuff, I think.
[58:35.490 --> 58:36.590]  Fucking mean girl, that's who it is.
[58:36.870 --> 58:36.930]  Yeah.
[58:39.350 --> 58:40.990]  Oh, she looked like Fern Brady.
[58:41.330 --> 58:45.170]  You know, I feel like diner culture's kind of over at this point.
[58:45.290 --> 58:46.510]  You remember diner culture?
[58:48.390 --> 58:52.330]  You go sit at a diner and hang out, is this like a social event? Drink a malted?
[58:52.710 --> 58:53.530]  What happened to that?
[58:54.770 --> 58:56.230]  What happened to it?
[58:56.470 --> 58:57.730]  Is Counter Cafe still around?
[58:58.450 --> 58:58.730]  Yes.
[58:59.230 --> 59:00.070]  Counter Cafe sucks.
[59:00.790 --> 59:01.870]  Yeah, fuck you.
[59:02.550 --> 59:03.450]  It didn't used to.
[59:03.750 --> 59:04.310]  No, no, no.
[59:04.830 --> 59:06.650]  That's the rage of disappointment.
[59:06.930 --> 59:09.230]  Because, Nick, I used to be a big Counter Cafe fan.
[59:09.370 --> 59:10.630]  I fucking loved Counter Cafe.
[59:10.730 --> 59:11.510]  I thought it was the best.
[59:11.670 --> 59:13.730]  And it's just, I just feel like it's gone downhill.
[59:14.230 --> 59:14.950]  Oh, that sucks.
[59:14.950 --> 59:19.190]  And also, speaking of disappointing, I had a Paperboy the other day for the first time.
[59:19.470 --> 59:19.950]  Told you.
[59:20.310 --> 59:21.930]  Fucking did I talk to you about that place?
[59:21.930 --> 59:25.090]  Oh my god, you did and you were 100% right.
[59:26.810 --> 59:30.950]  Overpriced, under-seasoned, bland, boring, uninspired.
[59:31.490 --> 59:31.650]  Yep.
[59:32.210 --> 59:33.570]  So not worth it.
[59:33.570 --> 59:40.290]  It is, it's a place where, like, my cousin wants to move here and she has her list of cool Instagram spots and she ate there and really liked it.
[59:40.370 --> 59:42.210]  And I went, oh yeah, that's what, that's who this is for.
[59:42.370 --> 59:43.110]  It is beautiful.
[59:43.410 --> 59:44.370]  Yeah, it looks great.
[59:44.370 --> 59:45.710]  It just tastes like nothing.
[59:45.930 --> 59:46.530]  What's it called?
[59:46.910 --> 59:47.270]  What is it?
[59:47.650 --> 59:47.990]  Paperboy?
[59:48.310 --> 59:48.650]  Paperboy.
[59:48.650 --> 59:50.910]  It's next to, it's like a block over from Nickel City.
[59:51.750 --> 59:52.010]  Oh.
[59:52.370 --> 59:53.990]  I just park over by Nickel City and go over there.
[59:54.370 --> 59:56.630]  It's like one of the hot breakfast and brunch spots.
[59:56.830 --> 59:57.430]  Yes, yeah, yeah.
[59:57.430 --> 01:00:00.250]  It's like, do you love waiting 45 minutes to eat some pancakes?
[01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:01.610]  Come to Paperboy.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.790]  Do you know if Magnolia Cafe is still any good?
[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.330]  Uh, I went there with Ray not too long ago.
[01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.790]  It was pretty good.
[01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.870]  Yeah, I always thought it was better than Kirby Lane.
[01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.890]  They're like pretty similar to me, I'd say.
[01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.110]  They're close.
[01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:18.110]  There's something about Magnolia I really like.
[01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:21.410]  I feel like Kirby Lane is stickier than Magnolia.
[01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.110]  Like the tables and stuff?
[01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:29.210]  The tables and the chairs and like all the salt and pepper shakers.
[01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:35.130]  Nick, I'm telling you, man, you got Austin Diner on Burnett and North Loop.
[01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:36.370]  That's...
[01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.610]  Oh, that place is good.
[01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:38.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.870]  That place is really good.
[01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.010]  That's the diner for me.
[01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:40.810]  That's the spot.
[01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.410]  Should we go to a diner after this movie?
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.520]  I think the bird forgot it could fly.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.740]  Gonna get in the way of our GTA Let's Play.
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.500]  Yeah, I mean, if you want to prioritize a diner over content, sure, man, I guess.
[01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.580]  What if we shot content at the diner?
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.400]  What if we played GTA at the diner?
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.540]  What if we went to a diner in GTA?
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.100]  That's the easiest method.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:11.380]  We can go to the Cluckin' Bell in GTA 4.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.100]  Oh, dude, we went to a...
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.140]  They opened a Nando's.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.380]  Yeah, have you been for a Cheeky Nando's in Wheeler?
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Yeah, we had a bit of a Cheeky Nando's the other day.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:31.600]  Right across from the Petey Bradley's.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.560]  I loved it. It was fantastic.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.540]  Did you get the hottest sauce?
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.500]  We used the hottest sauce, but I didn't get my chicken covered in it. I got the regular hot.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:47.380]  Everybody in England thinks that sauce is so hot, and then you try it and you're like, are you fucking kidding me?
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.420]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.880]  It's good, though. It tastes good.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:51.300]  It is very good. I like it. Oh, it's delicious.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.360]  It's just not hot.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:52.820]  Yeah.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.500]  You dug a whale trench.
[01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:08.130]  And any of that heat, too, is not a lingering heat, which is nice.
[01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:10.070]  Just flavorful.
[01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.800]  Oh, shit.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.480]  But the...
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.220]  But the charm.
[01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.550]  That's from my dad.
[01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.010]  Uh-oh.
[01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:25.510]  He died hunting whales.
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.830]  His name was Ahab.
[01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.430]  Oh, he's a creepy stalker.
[01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:31.810]  Oh, no, it's these guys.
[01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.450]  Kick his ass inside the whale.
[01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:44.490]  How much is this?
[01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:45.170]  Yeah, hit him with a shovel.
[01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:46.330]  Mosquito.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:03.840]  Okay.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.500]  What about now?
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.240]  You want to be me now?
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.100]  Who are these fucking...
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.700]  The henchmen are just fucking off.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.880]  All right, our friend's talking to his girl.
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.400]  Fuck you.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.680]  Start pushing each other around.
[01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:45.350]  Yeah!
[01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:49.350]  My dad had to do dental work on Shamu once.
[01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:50.050]  Really?
[01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:51.590]  Oh, my God.
[01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:53.270]  Why are we just hearing about this now?
[01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:54.970]  Have you never brought that...
[01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:56.310]  We've known you for a long time.
[01:03:56.310 --> 01:04:00.010]  We even had a conversation about how King Kong had dental work in that new movie.
[01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:01.650]  Are you an idiot, Nick?
[01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:05.650]  When did we have that conversation?
[01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:08.130]  That may have been prior to our regulation podcast.
[01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:11.030]  No, that was like a month ago.
[01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:12.470]  Oh, well, then never mind.
[01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.950]  Tell us.
[01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:16.090]  Oh, so...
[01:04:16.090 --> 01:04:17.350]  I'm from San Antonio.
[01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:18.670]  And in San Antonio, we have a SeaWorld.
[01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.530]  And my dad was an endodontist.
[01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:24.070]  And he was in the military.
[01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:26.830]  And so they were like, we...
[01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:28.710]  One of the whales has an issue with its...
[01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:29.650]  Like, one of its...
[01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:30.290]  I guess...
[01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:31.490]  I don't even know which tooth it was.
[01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:32.190]  It was towards the back.
[01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:35.430]  And my dad said that they were trying to find a way to hold the mouth open.
[01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:37.630]  So they had to use, like, multiple two-by-fours.
[01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:38.550]  Oh, wow.
[01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:39.270]  What?
[01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:43.630]  And then they had to use some giant x-ray machine.
[01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.070]  And he just did a little bit of work on it, I guess, to help pull a tooth.
[01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:47.670]  What?
[01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:48.850]  Was it sedated?
[01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:50.450]  Yeah, it was sedated.
[01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:52.490]  Was it in the water or out?
[01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.570]  Like, was it...
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:54.090]  How does...
[01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:54.530]  It was...
[01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:58.010]  You know, like how they come up on that little ledge that has the water on it?
[01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:59.590]  Oh, that makes sense.
[01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:02.450]  Nick, I hate to inform you, but your dad's a secret agent.
[01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:03.990]  And that's his cover story.
[01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:06.050]  Oh, no.
[01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:10.250]  Do you think your dad's been to Middle Earth like they went to in Kong vs. Godzilla?
[01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:13.010]  I'd like to believe he rode Shamu there.
[01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:13.950]  Middle Earth.
[01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:18.150]  Nick's dad made him eat inside Subway when they got Subway.
[01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:26.530]  Yeah, well, you see why some of the stories are a wide range between really cool and also, hey, we ate at a Subway on Sunday.
[01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:27.790]  Did you sit down in a Subway?
[01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.790]  Yeah.
[01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:29.930]  Yeah, dude.
[01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:32.350]  I said, have you ever been to one that had tables?
[01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:36.770]  Wait, what?
[01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.250]  You've never been to one with tables?
[01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:38.990]  No.
[01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.070]  Yeah, they exist.
[01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:41.970]  Wow.
[01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:46.410]  Nick would know he had to eat inside.
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:47.110]  Yeah.
[01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:52.570]  He looks like a budget snowman from Rudolph the cartoon.
[01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:53.470]  Yeah, he does.
[01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.110]  Jack Frost or whatever.
[01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.330]  Take the mic.
[01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.830]  He actually, he thought that they said cut at this point.
[01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.770]  Yeah, this is just.
[01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:26.570]  He's not acting.
[01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:29.650]  It's good that they didn't cut away from any of this.
[01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:30.790]  They just put this on TV.
[01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:35.650]  That was a funny shot.
[01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:38.010]  It's coming down.
[01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.670]  Get him.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.380]  Why would the camera pan back around?
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:09.420]  What?
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.260]  Pam's pissed.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.460]  Their ratings are going to be through the roof now.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.640]  We got the same webcam.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:25.740]  Is that the one you use with your grandfather?
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:31.960]  This is a brick.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:32.860]  Look at the size of it.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:37.660]  The picture has looked really nice, though.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.100]  Terrible parent.
[01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:51.130]  This is me and Albert fucking constantly.
[01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:56.530]  I was.
[01:07:56.830 --> 01:08:00.850]  I just needed to record and edit two episodes of saw right yesterday.
[01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.990]  And because of Albert, it took me almost seven hours.
[01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:06.970]  Every fucking ten minutes.
[01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:19.990]  Disarmed.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.960]  Andrew, Andrew, you got to relax.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.420]  Oh, listen, what I'm what I'm throwing bullets.
[01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.350]  Get in the face.
[01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:45.290]  Kill shot.
[01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:49.750]  Little bit higher.
[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:51.370]  Now she's going to have fun.
[01:08:51.670 --> 01:08:52.370]  That's crazy.
[01:08:55.230 --> 01:08:56.110]  Because, alas.
[01:09:00.190 --> 01:09:01.370]  She's put the gloves on.
[01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:06.430]  I would like to see behind the scenes footage of where this kid's throws were really landed.
[01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:07.010]  Yeah, right.
[01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:07.290]  Yeah.
[01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:08.450]  Oh, right in his head.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.320]  Wow.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.180]  He ran where she was going.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:17.840]  Come on, kid.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.560]  She doesn't care about the call with Beijing.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.400]  Dude, the Broncos are stomping the Chargers.
[01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:28.960]  This rocks.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:29.800]  What a day.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:30.820]  We got to watch snow day.
[01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:32.420]  Chargers are losing.
[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:33.340]  I'm having a great time.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.560]  Are those from a real thing?
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.420]  Does anyone recognize those action figures as being from anything?
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.460]  Yeah, Meltar.
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:41.320]  Chat, do you know?
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.260]  Meltar.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:45.600]  Meltar.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:46.520]  The Gorgonites.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.760]  They're small soldiers.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:53.740]  It's going to etch a grilled cheese sandwich.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:09:59.080]  Evil.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.540]  It's like a cross between Ken and Lion-O.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.820]  I was thinking Ryu.
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:09.260]  I like the polar bear guy with the tiniest fucking head you've ever seen.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.520]  Who, Meltar?
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.200]  No, that's not him.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.880]  What was the Nickelodeon show with the moving action figures?
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.240]  Do you remember what I'm talking about?
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:22.440]  Action League Now.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.700]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:26.940]  They were using their finest Action League Now.
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.520]  Melt Man and Stinky Diver and all that stuff?
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.080]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.240]  This guy's got like a wanking hand.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:34.860]  Hell yeah.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:35.920]  That's my kind of guy, dude.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:48.480]  I bet this took longer than shooting the whole rest of the movie.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.080]  No shit.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:51.220]  This was a lot of budget.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:51.940]  Unfortunately.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:59.040]  There's little things that pop up in movies like this where people say death or die or whatever,
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.160]  and then suddenly your three, four-year-old kid is like, you're going to die.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:04.620]  What the fuck?
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.380]  I've never experienced that one, buddy.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.480]  That might just be you.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:14.260]  You know like when they turn slowly and look at you and they say you're going to die and their eyes turn red
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.760]  and then like everything in the house starts shaking?
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.220]  You know, kid stuff.
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.020]  You know like when you walk into your kid's room and he's writing on the wall with a red crayon,
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.740]  red arm over and over again.
[01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.280]  And he's like upside down on the ceiling.
[01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:26.140]  Bat style.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:29.860]  Yep.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:39.410]  Nick, do you ever get weirded out that your kid could be alive in the year 2100?
[01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:41.170]  Oh, fuck.
[01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:44.230]  Yeah, do you ever get weirded out by that new thing to you, Nick?
[01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:47.330]  Does it weird you out that your kid might live a long and full life?
[01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:50.230]  Yeah, does that ever like fuck you up?
[01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:55.850]  I mean, the year fucks me up, but him living a long life would be ideal, me thinks.
[01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:56.790]  Good answer.
[01:11:59.210 --> 01:11:59.930]  Me thinks.
[01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.330]  Me thinks, me hopes.
[01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.890]  You better put that fucking thesaurus down.
[01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.210]  Don't let Snow Day rub off on you, Nick.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:17.920]  Okay.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:23.920]  I think GTA 6 will be out in the year 2100.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.700]  Oh, this is like Eurotrip, but Nickelodeon.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.060]  Everyone in this looks like they would be in Eurotrip.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:36.740]  Yeah.
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:37.980]  See?
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:40.820]  I thought they were going to not kiss.
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.460]  The hesitation was weird.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.440]  Yeah, she really hesitated.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.220]  And he did nothing.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.040]  She looks like she knows how to snowboard.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.680]  She does.
[01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.640]  Like not based on her outfit, just like her hair and like look.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.740]  Everything about her says I know how to snowboard.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.180]  I think he knows how to drink hot chocolate back at the inn.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.920]  Couldn't do a take two on that one, huh?
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.520]  We call this movie one and done, baby.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.920]  Is this 98 Degrees?
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.600]  I believe so.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:18.800]  Is that the Round Rock?
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.180]  No, honestly, too round.
[01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:25.200]  Chad, Chad.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.440]  I think Gavin loves this guy.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.840]  I think I hate this guy.
[01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.640]  So does Chevy Chase.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.960]  And so does Boss Hog.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.540]  Them Duke boys are at it again.
[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.400]  Isn't he like a weird right wing guy now?
[01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.460]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.500]  He's Dukes of Maga earlier.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:52.780]  He's got a lot of opinions.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.960]  I remember, this is going to sound crazy, but the thing that I remember him most for is he was the dad on Smallville.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.540]  Yes, he was.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.740]  He was pretty good in that.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.820]  Yeah, he was Superman's dad.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.260]  Holy shit.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.780]  I never made that connection.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:11.980]  That guy on the right looks like James May.
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.680]  He did kind of.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:21.980]  Making their way, the only way they know how.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.360]  That's just a little bit more than the law would allow.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.940]  Do you think Chevy Chase liked this guy?
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.520]  I don't think Chevy Chase likes anyone.
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:37.380]  I was going to ask earlier, do you guys think Chevy Chase has ever made a friend on set?
[01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:38.900]  No, not on set.
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.560]  Do you think he's weirded out when he likes someone?
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:42.520]  Yes, 100%.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.780]  He doesn't quite know what to do.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.420]  He kind of takes a step back and he looks in a mirror and he goes, what's this feeling?
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.480]  What happened to me?
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:55.000]  And then the camera pans back and up into the sky slowly as 2000's music plays.
[01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.790]  Yeah.
[01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:05.130]  Yeah.
[01:15:05.490 --> 01:15:07.470]  Everyone in the crowd, yeah, tell us.
[01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:08.570]  What, snow?
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:18.900]  Oh boy.
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:19.500]  Can't say that.
[01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:20.320]  Uh-uh.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.720]  One of the 11 words you can't say anymore.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.520]  Used to be seven.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.340]  Good old Canada.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:40.000]  Yep.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.060]  51st date.
[01:15:45.650 --> 01:15:47.650]  I thought you said 51st dates.
[01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:50.530]  That's a different thing.
[01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.210]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.370 --> 01:15:52.890]  Oh!
[01:15:56.730 --> 01:15:58.730]  Why'd everyone turn, why is this on the news?
[01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:03.790]  I just want to know if it's supposed to be sunny tomorrow.
[01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:09.790]  Just at home, what the fuck is going on?
[01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:11.430]  Why is this such a weird news day?
[01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.530]  What happened to that kid who professed his love earlier?
[01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:17.370]  Why aren't they talking about the robbery at the grocery store for Christ's sake?
[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:22.950]  Oh, I read, did you see the fun fact on snow day where there was a robbery?
[01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.390]  What?
[01:16:24.870 --> 01:16:25.570]  You didn't see that?
[01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:27.190]  All right, hang on, let me get back to it.
[01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:30.210]  I was looking at, I just pulled up the IMDB.
[01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.490]  Uh, trivia.
[01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:43.890]  A real bank heist took place near the filming location and the felons drove right past the production assistant who immediately alerted everyone on set.
[01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:48.330]  The felons were surprised to see what they were driving through was a film set.
[01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:53.690]  Shortly before driving headlong into and becoming hopelessly stuck in a fake snow drift.
[01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:55.090]  No.
[01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:56.830]  That's awesome.
[01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:59.150]  This movie caught bank robbers?
[01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.870]  Yep.
[01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:04.790]  Is he gonna go kiss the other girl now too?
[01:17:05.530 --> 01:17:06.030]  Hell yeah.
[01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:07.290]  This guy's crazy.
[01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.750]  Hell yeah.
[01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:10.770]  You can't, he just looked in the mirror and he said, you can't have it all.
[01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:17.850]  Well done.
[01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:23.470]  Yeah, get him, Nick.
[01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:24.510]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:40.250]  Whoa.
[01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:42.650]  Uh, don't do it.
[01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.070]  You already kissed.
[01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.450]  Oh.
[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:46.490]  Eww.
[01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:48.550]  Kiss the girl.
[01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.830]  This guy's getting some in this movie.
[01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:57.130]  Dear Penthouse Forum.
[01:17:57.410 --> 01:18:02.830]  I think his dick didn't respond in the same way this time and he realizes it's the other, the snowboarder he likes.
[01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:07.010]  Dear Penthouse Forum, anything can happen on a snow day.
[01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:14.090]  There I was, in the middle of an epic snow fight.
[01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:18.870]  A pied crow flew off in the distance.
[01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:25.030]  Some kid was strapped to a snowplow.
[01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:27.210]  This farting child ran by me.
[01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:35.950]  Push her off.
[01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:37.050]  Push her into the pool.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.380]  Just begun?
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.800]  What's the one on the side doing?
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.800]  Is that to, like, swing down?
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.360]  I guess?
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.720]  You know what we should do?
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:54.520]  What?
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.520]  How is this going to lead to content? Go ahead.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.300]  Oh my God, that bird!
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.660]  Tree's taking the wheel.
[01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.060]  You're going to love this idea.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.320]  The five of us together should write a sequel to Snow Day.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.420]  Our own script.
[01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:11.780]  Oh God.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:12.900]  Oh wow.
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.140]  That's crazy.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:16.940]  Why not?
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.880]  Honestly, why not?
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.700]  Why not? We just gotta outline it and then we'll just fucking bang it out.
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:24.260]  Like we banged out Celestial Gorbosis.
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.220]  42 year old Josh Peck returns to the town he grew up in.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.320]  I think they remade this movie?
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:32.020]  They did.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:32.840]  What?
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.080]  Are you fucking serious?
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.460]  In 2022 and you're...
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:38.640]  Hang on.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:42.080]  Rob Hubel's in it.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.660]  We gotta watch the remake and see how it compares.
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:46.900]  We don't. I don't think we do.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:47.940]  I think we do.
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:48.960]  You think the bird is CG?
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.820]  No, it's probably a dog.
[01:20:05.450 --> 01:20:05.850]  Jesus.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.380]  Uh oh.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.700]  Yeah man, talk your shit.
[01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:37.630]  Holy shit.
[01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:37.950]  Okay.
[01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:42.930]  There's a little bit of magic in this movie.
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.500]  The children rise.
[01:20:56.850 --> 01:20:57.810]  Oh shit.
[01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:00.070]  Rohirrim!
[01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:08.230]  The thing I'll say about this movie that I really like is that it's about 90 minutes long.
[01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:09.130]  Yes.
[01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:12.990]  And I think that's... I don't mean that as like making fun of it.
[01:21:13.090 --> 01:21:16.330]  I mean that as like a very positive thing for a movie like this.
[01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:17.470]  Yeah, it knows what it is.
[01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:22.730]  Yep. It does not overstay. It's not trying to do too much. It's giving you goofy storylines.
[01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:28.630]  It's like all these things sort of converge. This is great. This is what we are missing from movies now.
[01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:35.570]  You are 100% correct. Like in the pitch of this film, the first thing they say is, alright, it's 90 minutes.
[01:21:35.650 --> 01:21:37.770]  It's a kid's movie. It's about a snow day.
[01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.370]  Yep.
[01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:40.030]  You gotta lead with 90 minutes.
[01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.650]  Absolutely.
[01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:45.390]  Do you think this is all of Canada's hockey sticks?
[01:21:46.090 --> 01:21:49.350]  Yeah, they're gonna beat the shit out of him and his bird with hockey sticks.
[01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:54.270]  You know how there's more guns in America than people? Are there more hockey sticks in Canada than people?
[01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:55.030]  Yeah.
[01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.670]  Absolutely.
[01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:01.630]  They're gonna break his truck? His livelihood?
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:07.720]  Children playing.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.700]  Those children are the Canadian government.
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.540]  He is the postal workers.
[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:16.900]  Trudeau and his gang.
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:20.340]  Back to work.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.220]  You've broken him.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.700]  Back to work.
[01:22:50.970 --> 01:22:52.390]  You're gonna see him at school?
[01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:54.270]  Yeah, that's weird.
[01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.910]  Does he work at the school?
[01:22:56.410 --> 01:22:57.030]  Trudy does.
[01:22:58.110 --> 01:22:59.750]  No, he just likes to hang out there, I think.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.200]  You can do that.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.280]  You can de-plow.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.880]  From suck to blow?
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.740]  I didn't know that was the lyric.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.680]  That was all my darling Clementine.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.140]  Me too.
[01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:29.690]  We're stealing a car.
[01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:32.590]  It's gonna be a what?
[01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:33.810]  A real hoo-ha.
[01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:35.350]  The kid's braces.
[01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.670]  Return them to the children.
[01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.670]  So if they drive in reverse, they put all the snow back?
[01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:46.750]  Oh, like Ferris Bueller.
[01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:49.510]  Where's Trudy?
[01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:59.370]  Trudy ate him overnight.
[01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:01.430]  Pecked his eyes out?
[01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:02.510]  Yeah, just pecked at him.
[01:24:02.690 --> 01:24:05.630]  I'm just imagining the end of The Shining cuts to him the next morning.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:16.460]  Hi.
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:17.800]  Bye.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.600]  That dude does have a right to be upset.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.120]  He did steal his entire snowmobile.
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:25.160]  Yeah, no shit.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.080]  His dad's gonna be pissed.
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:29.000]  Oh, is he gonna fart?
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.300]  What the fuck?
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:54.740]  Oh, God.
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:55.640]  Yeah, die!
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:56.760]  Yeah, he's fucking dead.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:57.820]  No, you're dead!
[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.100]  You're dead now!
[01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:00.600]  That's it, it's over.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.000]  You'll never date that girl now.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:02.880]  You don't have legs!
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080]  Now you're different!
[01:25:12.210 --> 01:25:13.250]  That's gotta be a felony.
[01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:20.390]  It's Grand Theft Auto as well, I believe.
[01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:23.970]  This is great.
[01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:25.750]  This is such a great, like, kids movie plot.
[01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:28.090]  Chat's saying, try her as an adult.
[01:25:30.290 --> 01:25:31.330]  This was calculated.
[01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:32.010]  Premeditated.
[01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:36.090]  We have our notes in crayon.
[01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:37.950]  Left the dude to freeze to death.
[01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:39.050]  Drove over that kid.
[01:25:40.730 --> 01:25:41.950]  I want you to have him.
[01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:42.630]  Yeah!
[01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:44.550]  You can have Ryu.
[01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:54.540]  You think he looks that sick because he's just been eating asbestos this whole time?
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.960]  Yeah, I just think, like, he's fucked up.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.680]  Just got hypothermia the whole movie.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.280]  Under the fun fact section on IMDb.
[01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:12.310]  They should help get him out of the snow by pissing him out.
[01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:12.990]  Hell yeah.
[01:26:14.150 --> 01:26:15.110]  It'll keep him warm.
[01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:16.630]  Keep him alive.
[01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:17.330]  At least for a bit.
[01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.510]  Jesus.
[01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:21.630]  I think Trudy's gonna come down and get him.
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:27.300]  I think Trudy's gonna be eating good for a couple days.
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.220]  Iggy Pop's gonna show up tomorrow and have to call the cops about this dead kid in the snow.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.340]  Nah, this kid's gonna grow up to be the next Chris Elliott.
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:39.820]  He'll be driving that snow plow in ten years.
[01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:41.380]  Snow plow man beginnings!
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.900]  Oh my god, this is all that goes in the sequel!
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:46.780]  We gotta stop talking about it or it'll spoil the movie.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.540]  Like, what do you think the budget was for this movie? It couldn't have been that much, right?
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:26:59.460]  I can look it up.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:03.520]  What percentage of it went to Chevy Chase?
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.660]  That's what I was thinking.
[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:10.820]  Like, I think the budget was probably like eight to ten million.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.140]  Yeah, I was gonna guess seven.
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:21.440]  The year 2000, shot in 99? I bet it probably couldn't have been more than like...
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.280]  God, if it crossed ten million, that'd be crazy.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:30.100]  Did they not show the budget on Box Office Mojo anymore without paying for it?
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:36.940]  Oh no, it's there. Budget was $13 million.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.120]  Oh wow, I was gonna guess $12.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:45.780]  It opened with $14 million in the theater, went on to gross $60 million domestically.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.120]  This one was a huge hit.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:47.940]  $60 million?!
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:55.580]  Yeah. Did another $2 million internationally, I assume that's Andrew. $62,464,000 globally.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.240]  Wow!
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:27:59.720]  I couldn't watch that, I didn't like his ears were gonna get cut off.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.040]  Yeah.
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.020]  That was a dangerous stunt.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.220]  I think, like...
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.080]  Your ten minutes starts now.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:15.260]  This movie is very competently made. It came out in the year 2000, it wasn't a time where movies like...
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:20.720]  How movies now look, everything like looks pretty good, but everything kind of like sucks.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:27.920]  This was, this was pretty like, this is well lit, and at least like medium well shot, like this is fine, it's like a fine movie.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:34.040]  For $13 million, that's awesome. This is what we're missing, we need more of this stuff.
[01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:34.920]  I totally agree.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.780]  Yeah, we couldn't do this with $13 million.
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.120]  Luckily for us, we don't have to, because we don't have $13 million.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:50.120]  Yup. God, imagine if we had $13 million. That would be awesome.
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:54.000]  I wonder if you could buy Chris Elliott for $13 million.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:57.340]  Just hire him for us.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:02.020]  What the...
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.280]  Warriors! Come out and play!
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.280]  Are they going to kill someone?
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:08.920]  Yeah, Chris Elliott.
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:09.720]  I think they killed two people.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.980]  Yeah, I think the body count was two on that one.
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.160]  God, this fucking guy.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.500]  Here they come for the third.
[01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.760]  Now they're going to start killing people to cover it up.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.100]  You could have cut this guy entirely out of the movie.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:21.300]  He's been out all day?
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.800]  Alright, that's a fun payoff.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.420]  Why does he have outside lights inside?
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.000]  That's great.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.860]  That guy's had a shitty, shitty day.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.480]  Andrew, I didn't hate it.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:37.300]  That's great.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.780]  I really genuinely thought I was going to hate this movie.
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.860]  It's very, as you said, 98.
[01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:50.580]  It aims the audience. It's targeted for... Chris Elliott is a lot of fun in it.
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:51.560]  Yeah.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.300]  It is competently made. The script is fun enough.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:02.860]  All the characters are fine. It's a very, like, kid's idea, kid's movie.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.800]  And I think that's great.
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.460]  I feel like it's very understandable that me as a six-year-old thought this was a fantastic movie.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.300]  There's no point where the film drags.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.180]  Maybe around the Iggy Pop stuff, but not even really then.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.540]  It was pretty solid all the way through. This is a good film.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.060]  It's a fun little 90-minute movie.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:26.660]  For a kid's movie, I give it a solid seven and a half or eight.
[01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:31.660]  I'm going to be very surprised if they don't show bloopers in the credits.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:34.620]  I'll tell you what, though.
[01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:36.700]  All the bloopers are just Chevy Chase yelling at kids.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.060]  Stop stepping on his lines.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:44.040]  This really reminded me how fun a movie can be when it's not necessary two hours or more.
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:46.860]  God, when it's 90 minutes, isn't it a blast?
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:54.760]  I think a 90-minute movie is such a great time when you watch Crave and the Hunter and it's two and a half hours.
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:58.520]  And you just have Jordan Swear sitting next to you going,
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:03.080]  End! You have to end! No more scenes!
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.720]  And there's five more scenes.
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.040]  He had sunk down so low in his chair, he could not get lower.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.420]  It was awesome. It was so funny.
[01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:13.540]  What if we did a 90-minute movie draft?
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.240]  Oh, that'd be fun.
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:17.040]  That is a great idea.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.760]  90-minute movie draft is a great idea.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.760]  Midnight Toot's had a pretty good comment.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.960]  He said they had to keep Chevy Chase away from the main cast.
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:27.500]  He really did shoot away from the main cast most of the film.
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:29.740]  He doesn't have anything to do with anyone in that movie.
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:33.000]  I bet all the scenes with him and kids in the same shot were a green screen.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.800]  The only scene where his oldest son sees him and yells,
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:40.120]  Chevy Chase doesn't see him, they don't appear in the same shot together.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:40.760]  Yep.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.560]  Wow, how crazy.
[01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:46.480]  90-minute movie draft.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.000]  90-minute movie draft.
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.080]  I like that.
[01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.220]  I love that. I think it's a great idea.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.280]  Never seen a movie with so many B-plots.
[01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:57.460]  There's almost no A-plot. It's just B-plots.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800]  Oh, look at Cade!
[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.160]  Oh, wow!
[01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.100]  With the Aneg in the TLC logo style.
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.380]  No one's going to understand that.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:09.320]  Our audience does not get that at all.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:14.620]  Isn't Love actually just a series of B-plots?
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:15.600]  Yes, yes it is.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:18.500]  That's why I drafted it in our Christmas movie draft.
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.220]  I love that movie.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:23.360]  I'm just imagining that Aneg logo coming up with the HBO static sound.
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:29.260]  Except it's just the sound of an egg frying.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.120]  Hell yeah.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.980]  And then Sopranos starts.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:33.380]  Dogs and birds.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:40.400]  When you hear the HBO sound, what's the theme song that plays?
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.160]  Probably Sopranos.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:44.560]  Jeff?
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:49.580]  I don't hear any particular show.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:53.560]  I hear the original sound ID, which is the...
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.700]  That's from my childhood.
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.960]  Did that come after the static sound?
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.440]  Yeah, before the static sound, they had that one.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:08.540]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.200]  I don't think I've ever heard that.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.100]  Maybe Deadwood, actually.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.480]  Oh, Deadwood's a good one.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:16.340]  God, this show's so good.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.440]  For me, it's just so Sopranos.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:19.980]  Like, all the way.
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.200]  Like, every time I hear that static, it is...
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:23.160]  Oh, Sopranos is about to come on.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.440]  Oh, damn, Tales from the Crypt.
[01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.140]  Holy shit.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:28.520]  Oh, shit. That show freaked me out.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:29.600]  Oh, me too. Absolutely.
[01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:32.160]  Real sex, fucking A.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:38.000]  I feel like Jeff would have stories about knowing someone on real sex.
[01:33:38.460 --> 01:33:40.020]  I wish I did, but I don't.
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.700]  It just feels like you would.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:44.100]  Well, guys, I think we did it.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.480]  I think we watched Snow Day all the way through.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.160]  Andrew, great pick.
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:51.220]  Great pick.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:53.840]  Yeah, they went way better than I thought.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:55.080]  It was just...
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.000]  I wanted a movie that was for the season that you guys wouldn't have seen.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.200]  And this was my go-to as a kid.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.300]  And that was for winning the summer movie.
[01:34:04.380 --> 01:34:06.340]  And that was for winning. Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:07.640]  I got to make the pick.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.080]  The music starts in about 45 seconds.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:10.820]  Oh, cool.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.500]  Well, there you go, guys.
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.020]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.040]  Thank you for being Falcons.
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.820]  Thank you for supporting us directly.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.820]  We could not do this without you.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:26.420]  We really appreciate you being a part of this and supporting us on Patreon.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.960]  We definitely...
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:30.320]  We could try to do this without you.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.440]  It would not go well.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:33.140]  So we really appreciate you.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.760]  We wouldn't be able to do it for very long.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:36.080]  That's for sure.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:41.040]  So we really, really, truly, definitely, as much as we say it, we mean it twice as much.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.620]  Because we could not do this without you.
[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:44.220]  So thank you very much for being a part of this.
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:49.480]  And to be honest, as soon as we get off this, we're going to talk about you guys and how much we appreciate you, but privately.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.660]  Yeah, that's very true.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:53.020]  You guys were great in the chat, too.
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:53.920]  This was a lot of fun.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.040]  This was a great way to do it.
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.260]  A lot of comedy in the chat tonight.
[01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.380]  What are the Falcon ratings before we go?
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:34:59.800]  Out of 10.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.120]  Oh, yeah.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.140]  What do you guys rate that movie?
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:02.920]  10 out of 10.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:03.280]  Solid.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:03.720]  7.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:03.860]  7.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:04.780]  7.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:05.120]  7.
[01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.360]  7 out of 10 is a classic Bagel rating.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:07.900]  7.
[01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:08.160]  Oh.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.720]  9.7 from...
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:14.360]  Decent.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.220]  I think the average is somewhere between 7 and 8.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.260]  Pretty good.
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.300]  Dusky, Jenna...
[01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:19.060]  5 out of 10.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.020]  Vyosh?
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.480]  For, for, like, a movie, whatever.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.520]  It's like a 6.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.140]  Who cares?
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.200]  For a 90-minute kids movie that came out in the year 2000, that's like an 8.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:40.620]  That like, it does everything pretty well. None of it is very like boring or drags. It does a good
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:44.800]  job at what it's trying to do. I think that's an 8 out of 10 if you're judging it from what it is
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:50.220]  trying to achieve. I was just about to say too, like they don't make that movie that good today,
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:56.620]  but I guess we can check because it was remade in 2022. But you know, just by thinking,
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:02.400]  not even closing your eyes, you know exactly what it looks like. Yeah. You know how it's lit,
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.400]  you know what the characters look like, you know how everyone's dressed, like, you know,
[01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:11.820]  none of it is the ugly little fat kid who farts. None of it, like that doesn't,
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:17.860]  that that's not it, man. It's just not. Yeah, you're totally right. So I don't know. It's a
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:24.060]  bummer, but that's a fun movie. Good pick, Andrew. We'll have to see who wins the next movie draft
[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:29.680]  and who watch and what we watch because that's a blast. I can't wait. Yep. Have a good night,
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:36.160]  everybody. Thank you very much. And we'll see you next time for our next Falcon event. We
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:41.020]  appreciate you guys and we'll see you later. Bye. Love you, bye. Love you.
