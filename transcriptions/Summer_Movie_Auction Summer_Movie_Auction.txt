[00:00.000 --> 00:06.840]  Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.
[00:07.000 --> 00:10.780]  It's everything you've loved about every family vacation you've ever been on,
[00:10.960 --> 00:14.180]  with mind-blowing thrills at the largest water park at sea,
[00:14.520 --> 00:19.520]  seven onboard pools for every level of chill, more than 40 ways to dine and drink,
[00:19.680 --> 00:24.280]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.100]  This is the new Star of the Seas. Click or tap the banner to find out more.
[00:30.100 --> 00:35.300]  Hello and welcome to a summer movie battle, which everybody understands the rules of
[00:35.300 --> 00:40.310]  and will not be any confusion of at all. This is sort of like a draft and or...
[00:41.280 --> 00:44.440]  It's a draft, but it's an auction style. I don't know if you guys have ever done
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.160]  like an auction draft in a fantasy league, but it's very similar to that.
[00:49.240 --> 00:51.020]  Anyone? Anyone do that before?
[00:51.580 --> 00:53.020]  You know all about this.
[00:53.420 --> 00:58.280]  Yeah, Kevin, you're a big auction guy. Has anyone ever here outside of me been
[00:58.280 --> 01:02.860]  involved in an auction? I famously secured the tuxedo, I guess eBay.
[01:03.160 --> 01:04.780]  I didn't think about that, but yeah.
[01:05.660 --> 01:08.540]  One billion Marcus Smart auctions on eBay.
[01:09.220 --> 01:11.700]  Well, there you go. You're going to be a veteran at this, Jeff. It is
[01:11.700 --> 01:15.460]  the same idea as an auction for how we're going to pick these.
[01:15.740 --> 01:16.820]  Is it a silent auction?
[01:17.320 --> 01:20.480]  No, it's a very audible auction because this is a podcast.
[01:21.300 --> 01:28.120]  Yeah, silent auction would not work well. As you see, we have our names listed on this document.
[01:28.840 --> 01:33.720]  Aneg, Andrew, Nick, Eric, Jeff, Gavin, and above our names, we have 98.
[01:34.340 --> 01:37.420]  Classic number. Last great year, some would say.
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.780]  How this is going to work is we all have 98 points and we're going to go through
[01:42.780 --> 01:45.200]  the movies on the left side of the screen.
[01:45.580 --> 01:50.020]  These are all coming out this summer and we're going to auction them off one by one.
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.080]  Your goal is to have the collection of movies that earns the most money domestically
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.340]  by the end of the summer.
[01:57.340 --> 01:58.960]  But we haven't seen them.
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.200]  No, we haven't seen them. But, you know, movies make money even if you don't see them, Gavin.
[02:03.380 --> 02:09.320]  I don't know if you know this, but you having to see the film doesn't actually equate to it
[02:09.320 --> 02:10.040]  making money.
[02:10.400 --> 02:10.780]  Good deal.
[02:10.940 --> 02:15.860]  So now it depends. Now, are we in Gavin's universe right now or are we in yours?
[02:16.620 --> 02:22.140]  I'm hoping we're just in the universe. I don't know why we're specific to whose universe it is.
[02:22.300 --> 02:23.180]  Can I ask a question?
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.220]  Yeah, of course.
[02:24.220 --> 02:26.780]  How were the colors decided?
[02:27.520 --> 02:28.060]  Oh, interesting.
[02:28.360 --> 02:29.220]  Uh, good question.
[02:29.960 --> 02:33.560]  Very good question. Well, obviously, Jeff, you're kind of you're the orange guy.
[02:33.760 --> 02:34.720]  You have a history.
[02:34.980 --> 02:35.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:35.860 --> 02:36.840]  Classic orange.
[02:37.120 --> 02:38.680]  Classically, the orange guy.
[02:38.960 --> 02:42.140]  Yeah, Eric is a piss rat, so he's got to be yellow.
[02:43.280 --> 02:45.960]  I was happy to be yellow and now I'm not.
[02:46.300 --> 02:46.820]  So, all right.
[02:47.180 --> 02:48.360]  I like Grubbs' weed.
[02:49.660 --> 02:52.840]  Oh, yeah, classic classic ganja Nick.
[02:52.920 --> 02:53.780]  Oh, yeah, that's me.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.120]  Not scared at all.
[02:55.780 --> 02:57.420]  Are Nick and Gavin happy with your colors?
[02:57.620 --> 02:58.180]  Love it.
[02:59.040 --> 03:00.680]  Are we going to auction off our colors?
[03:00.740 --> 03:02.340]  Should we have like a color like this?
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.420]  Should we have a one-time color if anybody wants to swap colors?
[03:05.760 --> 03:06.020]  Make it right?
[03:06.220 --> 03:08.300]  I'll bid five points for blue.
[03:09.180 --> 03:11.420]  I'm good. I'm good.
[03:11.800 --> 03:12.780]  Anyone want yellow?
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.040]  You could start with 103 points.
[03:16.280 --> 03:18.360]  Anyone want yellow? Anyone?
[03:19.140 --> 03:20.940]  You can't give away piss rat yellow.
[03:21.140 --> 03:21.320]  Yeah.
[03:21.540 --> 03:21.880]  You're a piss rat.
[03:21.880 --> 03:24.840]  I'll switch yellow for orange if you give me 40 points.
[03:24.940 --> 03:26.860]  Why the fuck would I give you anything?
[03:27.200 --> 03:28.860]  Yellow is a way better color than orange.
[03:28.960 --> 03:30.260]  I'm just seeing if there are any takers.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.040]  All right.
[03:31.580 --> 03:33.120]  I'm willing to take yellow off your hands.
[03:33.180 --> 03:36.560]  You don't have to be the piss rat guy this one episode for 40 points.
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.680]  Okay. Hey, Andrew, I have a question about the rules.
[03:39.320 --> 03:39.560]  Okay.
[03:40.180 --> 03:43.260]  You said money that these make domestically.
[03:43.520 --> 03:46.340]  I assume that means United States box office.
[03:46.480 --> 03:47.180]  Great question.
[03:47.520 --> 03:50.660]  I'm only asking because I've known you for this long
[03:50.660 --> 03:54.460]  and I don't anticipate this being an easy answer if I don't ask now.
[03:55.060 --> 03:57.480]  So domestic, when you look at box office mojo,
[03:57.640 --> 03:59.500]  it's divided by worldwide or domestic.
[03:59.760 --> 04:00.680]  It's U.S. and Canada.
[04:01.320 --> 04:02.300]  Oh, okay. Okay.
[04:02.560 --> 04:02.880]  Yeah.
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.120]  That just felt like a really long answer that I was not going to get a straight answer for.
[04:07.580 --> 04:09.480]  But you know, it was very clear.
[04:10.400 --> 04:11.620]  No, no.
[04:11.720 --> 04:12.560]  You did a great job.
[04:12.700 --> 04:13.600]  I stand corrected.
[04:13.720 --> 04:14.300]  Thank you very much.
[04:14.340 --> 04:17.880]  This is a game that I played with my friends for quite a few years.
[04:17.920 --> 04:18.840]  So it's beta tested.
[04:19.160 --> 04:20.480]  I'm prepared for these questions.
[04:21.100 --> 04:21.460]  Six.
[04:21.720 --> 04:22.740]  Do we have any other questions?
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.740]  Gavin, you understand?
[04:24.380 --> 04:26.020]  You're projecting, you're trying to base,
[04:26.140 --> 04:28.420]  even though the movie hasn't come out and you haven't seen it yet,
[04:28.820 --> 04:31.640]  you want to try to pick movies that you think will make money.
[04:32.120 --> 04:35.140]  I bid six points for this intro.
[04:35.700 --> 04:35.860]  Okay.
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.560]  So I do have a question, Andrew.
[04:39.700 --> 04:40.060]  Okay.
[04:40.760 --> 04:42.120]  And it's a real one, it's not a fake question.
[04:42.180 --> 04:43.080]  Absolutely. I'm ready.
[04:43.860 --> 04:45.480]  So when is it over?
[04:46.280 --> 04:49.700]  By the summer, like what's the last day of the competition?
[04:49.700 --> 04:50.020]  That's a great question.
[04:50.020 --> 04:52.120]  So when do we refilm?
[04:52.640 --> 04:55.880]  So I think the last movie on the list is Beetlejuice,
[04:55.940 --> 04:58.220]  which comes out in the first week of September.
[04:58.860 --> 05:01.220]  I did that to compensate for the fact that we're starting this
[05:01.220 --> 05:03.000]  a little bit late from when we typically start in May.
[05:03.400 --> 05:07.000]  I say that we will wrap this up when Beetlejuice is no longer like making money.
[05:07.580 --> 05:10.640]  As long as whoever owns it can't be shifted.
[05:10.640 --> 05:12.060]  Well, I don't, I don't like that.
[05:12.160 --> 05:13.100]  I don't like that either.
[05:13.300 --> 05:13.500]  Like what?
[05:13.580 --> 05:14.260]  We need a date.
[05:14.520 --> 05:15.360]  There needs to be a date.
[05:15.860 --> 05:16.320]  Well, what?
[05:16.320 --> 05:21.220]  I mean, maybe if it's like if it's over when all films in their theatrical run or whatever.
[05:21.360 --> 05:25.340]  But what if Beetlejuice 2 is the next Titanic and it's in the theaters for a year?
[05:26.860 --> 05:29.680]  Then you probably win if you buy Beetlejuice 2.
[05:29.960 --> 05:34.180]  But I just, I just think there needs to be like, okay, if the, if the first,
[05:34.320 --> 05:35.460]  How about October 1st?
[05:35.640 --> 05:38.600]  I was going to say if the first day of fall is September 22nd
[05:38.600 --> 05:42.920]  and Beetlejuice comes out September 1st, let's give it a good month to get a gross.
[05:43.100 --> 05:44.620]  And that would be October 1st.
[05:44.660 --> 05:45.400]  I think that's fair.
[05:45.960 --> 05:48.820]  As long as we're all on the same page, that's fine.
[05:48.960 --> 05:53.500]  I just, I kind of left it open ended because it's sort of at a disadvantage opening the latest.
[05:53.900 --> 05:56.280]  But if we all are going in knowing it's October 1st.
[05:56.420 --> 05:57.760]  But, but that's part of the auction, baby.
[05:57.940 --> 05:59.980]  So does that mean this doesn't come out until then?
[06:00.320 --> 06:04.660]  No, this part will come out and I will be updating throughout the summer what our totals are.
[06:04.740 --> 06:05.080]  Oh, okay.
[06:05.120 --> 06:05.940]  Something we can review.
[06:06.600 --> 06:09.440]  And if you want to maybe, you know, you want to support your movie.
[06:09.900 --> 06:13.920]  If one of us sees Bad Boys and owns it, you know that you're boosting your own totals.
[06:14.300 --> 06:14.440]  Right.
[06:14.480 --> 06:14.920]  It's kind of fun.
[06:14.920 --> 06:19.360]  So we're gonna, so we're gonna do this auction and we are gonna let the audience know
[06:19.360 --> 06:21.860]  what our numbers are and where we start.
[06:22.140 --> 06:27.440]  Unlike the grip test, which I was willing to do that and then, uh, right.
[06:27.580 --> 06:31.140]  Listen, so, okay, let's do, hey, let's do an example one real quick,
[06:31.140 --> 06:35.180]  because clearly untitled new line horror is not going to be anything.
[06:35.840 --> 06:39.140]  So what, what does this look like for us?
[06:39.140 --> 06:40.900]  Like, what are the steps in this process?
[06:41.220 --> 06:42.840]  Like walk us through this here, Andrew.
[06:42.900 --> 06:44.440]  So the steps in the process.
[06:44.440 --> 06:47.720]  Yes. So untitled new line horror, probably not going to come out,
[06:47.780 --> 06:48.960]  but it is currently on the schedule.
[06:49.480 --> 06:53.360]  I would say next movie up untitled new line horror,
[06:53.620 --> 06:56.340]  and then somebody would say a number they want to bid for it
[06:56.340 --> 06:57.480]  if they want to bid anything.
[06:58.520 --> 07:00.120]  So I don't know, maybe I would.
[07:00.240 --> 07:02.040]  We'll just say, for example, I'll say five.
[07:02.780 --> 07:03.000]  Okay.
[07:03.180 --> 07:05.580]  And then somebody else could say six if they wanted it.
[07:05.620 --> 07:08.940]  And then we just go through that process until we have a max bid.
[07:09.060 --> 07:10.580]  And then we move on to the next one.
[07:11.020 --> 07:13.360]  And as you underneath your name, when you buy a movie,
[07:13.360 --> 07:14.300]  see, it's 98.
[07:14.440 --> 07:16.680]  Let's say I bought it for six, put it in.
[07:17.460 --> 07:18.560]  It subtracts to 92.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.760]  So we can keep track of everyone's toys.
[07:21.060 --> 07:22.580]  It does the subtracting.
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.000]  Jeff doesn't have to do it in his head.
[07:24.040 --> 07:25.160]  No, you don't have to do it.
[07:25.160 --> 07:26.260]  You just have to put your number.
[07:26.400 --> 07:27.000]  Oh, nice.
[07:27.020 --> 07:27.320]  Hang on.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.380]  But how are we keeping track of the movies?
[07:30.140 --> 07:31.160]  We'll write them down.
[07:31.600 --> 07:32.060]  That's just it.
[07:32.060 --> 07:32.720]  You need to write them down.
[07:32.860 --> 07:34.940]  You could either highlight them the color you are,
[07:35.220 --> 07:39.780]  or you could just put your name next to like in the B slot or C slot.
[07:39.780 --> 07:40.300]  I can do that.
[07:40.360 --> 07:41.020]  Okay, I'll do that.
[07:41.120 --> 07:41.520]  I'll do that.
[07:41.520 --> 07:43.600]  I'll put them in the B slot.
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.220]  Yeah, we're saying we like someone else is controlling this.
[07:46.420 --> 07:47.800]  I'm right here.
[07:47.800 --> 07:49.160]  We all have access to the document.
[07:49.380 --> 07:50.500]  I just want to make sure that.
[07:52.440 --> 07:54.560]  Oh, just because it's your screen.
[07:55.000 --> 07:56.860]  That noise is why I asked.
[07:57.800 --> 07:59.340]  I'm rolling on it.
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.640]  Okay, I feel comfortable with this.
[08:02.760 --> 08:03.860]  I feel good about this.
[08:05.320 --> 08:06.800]  I feel like we can do it.
[08:06.860 --> 08:07.960]  How do you guys feel about it?
[08:08.100 --> 08:08.440]  Great.
[08:08.640 --> 08:10.680]  I feel super awesome about it.
[08:10.680 --> 08:13.960]  I forgot. I forgot the last part, the wager, the stakes.
[08:14.320 --> 08:15.460]  I wanted to run this by you.
[08:15.480 --> 08:16.620]  I meant to do this before we recorded.
[08:17.220 --> 08:23.160]  I thought it could be fun that, you know, we have a stage on our Discord.
[08:23.880 --> 08:27.040]  And we're doing things for like events, community things.
[08:27.700 --> 08:34.460]  Whoever wins this league, maybe we do a live watch along on center stage for the Falcons and up.
[08:35.700 --> 08:38.340]  And whoever wins gets to pick what that movie is.
[08:39.900 --> 08:42.900]  Oh, so we're watching the movie with everyone is what you're saying?
[08:43.220 --> 08:47.460]  We'd be watching a movie on our stage for the people that are in the Falcon tier and above.
[08:47.620 --> 08:49.420]  And whoever wins gets to pick.
[08:49.520 --> 08:52.000]  And we'd be doing it live because it's on the Discord stage thing.
[08:52.120 --> 08:52.940]  So people can listen to it live.
[08:53.540 --> 08:57.020]  The first live watch along, whoever wins gets to pick what that movie is.
[08:57.220 --> 08:57.980]  I like it.
[08:58.220 --> 08:58.760]  I think that's fine.
[08:58.860 --> 08:59.320]  You okay with that?
[08:59.980 --> 09:00.260]  Yeah.
[09:00.540 --> 09:05.800]  Or what if the lowest person had to wear the red boots at the mall instead of me?
[09:08.460 --> 09:09.140]  No deal.
[09:10.940 --> 09:12.020]  You know what's funny?
[09:12.180 --> 09:14.660]  I forgot that you had to do that, but it just reminded me.
[09:15.920 --> 09:16.320]  Absolutely.
[09:17.260 --> 09:18.260]  That's what just happened.
[09:18.360 --> 09:19.760]  Are you editing that out of this?
[09:22.380 --> 09:23.240]  We good to go?
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.200]  Do we have any other questions?
[09:24.420 --> 09:24.820]  Any concerns?
[09:25.040 --> 09:25.520]  Did you have something?
[09:26.240 --> 09:29.320]  So you can buy as many movies as you can afford.
[09:29.420 --> 09:29.760]  Is that right?
[09:29.880 --> 09:30.260]  Absolutely.
[09:30.840 --> 09:31.140]  Okay.
[09:31.540 --> 09:32.020]  That's my last question.
[09:32.020 --> 09:33.180]  There's all sorts of strategies.
[09:33.340 --> 09:35.080]  Some people stock up on big ones.
[09:35.160 --> 09:37.000]  Some people try to buy as many as they can.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.920]  Just hope for a lottery ticket, essentially.
[09:39.560 --> 09:40.100]  But I think we're good.
[09:40.160 --> 09:41.060]  Gavin, you have any questions?
[09:41.220 --> 09:43.700]  You're the typically most confused drafter.
[09:44.280 --> 09:47.200]  I think that's offensive, and I understand entirely.
[09:49.840 --> 09:53.340]  You understand that you are the most confused drafter,
[09:53.480 --> 09:54.960]  or you understand the rules here?
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.080]  Yes.
[10:00.260 --> 10:02.920]  So the first movie on our list is If.
[10:03.020 --> 10:06.240]  Eric, if you want to highlight it with your thing, it'll show a poster for the film.
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.060]  Here is the movie, If.
[10:08.680 --> 10:10.820]  It is a Ryan Reynolds kids film.
[10:11.140 --> 10:12.400]  I'm going to start at five.
[10:12.820 --> 10:13.720]  I'll put five on this.
[10:14.240 --> 10:15.780]  This comes out on Friday, by the way.
[10:16.140 --> 10:16.400]  Oh!
[10:18.080 --> 10:19.100]  I'll bid four.
[10:19.820 --> 10:20.940]  Well, you can't bid below.
[10:21.500 --> 10:22.520]  You can only bid above.
[10:23.280 --> 10:23.600]  Six?
[10:23.860 --> 10:25.000]  Six and a half.
[10:25.540 --> 10:25.740]  All right.
[10:25.800 --> 10:26.820]  No halves, please.
[10:27.040 --> 10:27.780]  Please, no halves.
[10:28.640 --> 10:29.380]  All right, he's got it.
[10:31.100 --> 10:31.860]  Who said eight?
[10:31.960 --> 10:32.180]  Nine!
[10:33.060 --> 10:33.320]  I said eight.
[10:33.720 --> 10:34.580]  Gavin at nine.
[10:35.180 --> 10:35.680]  I'll take ten.
[10:36.900 --> 10:37.220]  Woo!
[10:37.900 --> 10:38.920]  Guy with the kid.
[10:39.480 --> 10:41.340]  See, that makes me want to go 11 because you got a kid.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.780]  I feel like you kind of have a read on what movies.
[10:44.120 --> 10:44.560]  He doesn't.
[10:44.660 --> 10:45.380]  What do they know?
[10:46.900 --> 10:48.120]  I'm going to put it out.
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.420]  So you're saying, Andrew, you're at 11?
[10:53.360 --> 10:54.020]  No, no.
[10:54.100 --> 10:55.300]  I'm saying Nick's at 10.
[10:55.380 --> 10:57.460]  I'm going to render off because I'm also the auctioneer of this.
[10:57.580 --> 10:58.760]  So I was saying going once.
[10:59.840 --> 11:00.040]  Oh.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.740]  Going once for Nick at 10.
[11:03.160 --> 11:03.800]  Going twice.
[11:03.800 --> 11:05.380]  Oh, did I fuck up?
[11:05.580 --> 11:05.640]  11.
[11:06.180 --> 11:07.600]  Oh, that right under there.
[11:07.700 --> 11:08.320]  I heard it.
[11:08.540 --> 11:09.980]  I heard Jeff got right under the wire.
[11:10.420 --> 11:11.400]  Jeff said 11.
[11:11.780 --> 11:12.360]  Jeff said 11.
[11:12.660 --> 11:13.360]  I was at 11.
[11:14.160 --> 11:15.080]  Do you want to go to 12?
[11:16.120 --> 11:17.180]  You're going to let him have it.
[11:17.360 --> 11:18.960]  Going one for Jeff at 11.
[11:19.740 --> 11:20.260]  Twice.
[11:20.720 --> 11:21.600]  I just wanted to sucker someone.
[11:22.620 --> 11:23.260]  Jeff's sold.
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.700]  Jeff gets if.
[11:25.300 --> 11:30.100]  Ryan Reynolds doesn't make movies that don't bring in box office.
[11:30.340 --> 11:31.980]  I'm feeling pretty good.
[11:31.980 --> 11:34.020]  What was the one where he was the digital guy?
[11:34.400 --> 11:35.440]  That did pretty bad.
[11:35.780 --> 11:36.480]  Fall guy?
[11:36.760 --> 11:36.840]  Free guy?
[11:36.940 --> 11:37.340]  Free guy.
[11:38.020 --> 11:39.540]  Yeah, but that had laser beam in it.
[11:40.100 --> 11:41.340]  Fun fact about Fall Guy.
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.340]  It didn't do well.
[11:43.040 --> 11:44.000]  Next category.
[11:44.360 --> 11:45.480]  Is that a fun fact?
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.580]  Fun fact about Fall Guy.
[11:47.860 --> 11:51.980]  We had the pitch making content for that thing and it did not happen.
[11:54.340 --> 11:55.300]  Next category.
[11:55.620 --> 11:56.260]  Back to Black.
[11:57.580 --> 11:58.360]  Excellent film.
[11:58.920 --> 12:01.460]  Back to Black is the Amy Winehouse.
[12:02.060 --> 12:05.160]  Yeah, I'll put one point on Back to Black.
[12:05.420 --> 12:05.960]  I'll go.
[12:06.100 --> 12:06.300]  I'm good.
[12:06.440 --> 12:09.060]  I'll go two, three.
[12:11.120 --> 12:12.180]  Nick's getting into it.
[12:12.740 --> 12:14.180]  I don't think I want to do four.
[12:14.440 --> 12:14.840]  I think I'm out.
[12:15.140 --> 12:15.600]  No, no.
[12:15.740 --> 12:17.720]  Nick is leading at three.
[12:18.260 --> 12:20.220]  Does anyone want Back to Black for more than three?
[12:20.580 --> 12:20.740]  Nah.
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.300]  Three was the highest I was going to go to.
[12:23.660 --> 12:24.760]  Nick gets Back to Black.
[12:25.260 --> 12:26.820]  Nick, are you a big Amy Winehouse guy?
[12:27.780 --> 12:28.800]  I like her music.
[12:29.240 --> 12:29.880]  My wife likes her.
[12:29.880 --> 12:32.340]  I'm going to tell her to see it like a thousand times.
[12:33.940 --> 12:35.960]  I'm not sure why this is coming out now.
[12:36.400 --> 12:37.720]  Like, that is my main confusion.
[12:37.900 --> 12:40.540]  I mean, I admittedly haven't seen the trailer, but...
[12:40.540 --> 12:42.300]  I've read reviews are bad.
[12:43.900 --> 12:46.560]  Everything on TikTok about it has been,
[12:47.100 --> 12:49.820]  Hey, what the fuck is this movie?
[12:50.300 --> 12:51.880]  It is not good.
[12:52.160 --> 12:52.360]  Oh, wow.
[12:52.820 --> 12:53.000]  Yeah.
[12:53.040 --> 12:53.820]  Oh, that's fascinating.
[12:54.120 --> 12:58.160]  So I do think there will be a cringe watch factor where some people will go see it.
[12:58.420 --> 12:58.860]  Yeah.
[12:59.080 --> 12:59.620]  But that's it.
[12:59.880 --> 13:03.620]  I will say this now makes me want to see it more than I did going into this.
[13:03.940 --> 13:06.760]  So, Nick, it might work out on the cringe alone.
[13:06.920 --> 13:07.540]  Please do it.
[13:07.600 --> 13:13.360]  Next film, The Strangers Chapter One, which I believe is the third Strangers film, at least.
[13:14.020 --> 13:14.880]  I think you're right.
[13:15.080 --> 13:15.720]  This is like...
[13:17.600 --> 13:19.400]  Is this like a prequel to The Strangers?
[13:19.540 --> 13:20.560]  It has to be, right?
[13:20.640 --> 13:23.000]  If it's Chapter One, I imagine that's the idea.
[13:23.840 --> 13:24.900]  I'm going to put one.
[13:25.280 --> 13:26.480]  Did you hover over the thing?
[13:27.080 --> 13:27.400]  Oh, here.
[13:27.500 --> 13:27.740]  Sorry.
[13:28.180 --> 13:28.460]  Two.
[13:29.220 --> 13:30.220]  There you go.
[13:30.300 --> 13:31.420]  Did that help you?
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.540]  Gavin, it's a horror film.
[13:37.260 --> 13:39.400]  It's about random murders.
[13:39.840 --> 13:40.860]  It's about people that watch.
[13:41.360 --> 13:41.760]  Yeah.
[13:42.440 --> 13:43.460]  They watch stuff.
[13:43.660 --> 13:44.640]  They see what happens.
[13:46.020 --> 13:47.820]  Did someone say two?
[13:48.000 --> 13:48.780]  I said two.
[13:49.460 --> 13:50.280]  Nick has two.
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.240]  Nick's going for volume.
[13:53.500 --> 13:55.420]  And they're going to lock this in with two?
[13:55.780 --> 13:56.800]  I'll say four.
[13:57.540 --> 13:58.040]  Oh!
[13:58.040 --> 13:59.460]  Eric coming in with four.
[14:00.020 --> 14:01.660]  Anyone going to go higher than four?
[14:01.800 --> 14:02.360]  We got four.
[14:02.780 --> 14:03.420]  We're locking in at four.
[14:03.500 --> 14:04.040]  Four going one.
[14:04.940 --> 14:05.820]  Four going twice.
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.400]  Sold to Eric at four.
[14:09.720 --> 14:10.260]  That's a good pick, Eric.
[14:10.260 --> 14:10.940]  Eric on the board.
[14:11.160 --> 14:13.140]  Have you seen any of The Stranger movies, Eric?
[14:13.500 --> 14:16.460]  No, but I know that they are like cult hits.
[14:16.960 --> 14:18.740]  Yeah, the first one was huge.
[14:19.000 --> 14:19.700]  The first one was great.
[14:19.700 --> 14:21.800]  So I'm pretty, you know, so-
[14:21.800 --> 14:24.680]  You put a Watcher on a movie and it's probably good for 30 million.
[14:24.680 --> 14:25.580]  Mm-hmm.
[14:25.920 --> 14:33.560]  And now, arguably, the first big movie, Furiosa, a Mad Max saga.
[14:33.980 --> 14:34.540]  I'm going to put 10.
[14:35.260 --> 14:35.540]  Shit.
[14:35.620 --> 14:36.320]  Wow, 11.
[14:36.800 --> 14:37.500]  That was Gavin.
[14:37.600 --> 14:38.660]  Yeah, there's 11 to Andrew.
[14:40.220 --> 14:40.740]  15.
[14:41.500 --> 14:43.940]  Oh, wow, Gavin, 15.
[14:44.740 --> 14:46.060]  It's not a great trailer.
[14:47.880 --> 14:48.920]  Uh, uh.
[14:48.940 --> 14:49.640]  I haven't seen it.
[14:50.960 --> 14:52.600]  Uh, man, that could be a steal.
[14:52.680 --> 14:53.000]  16.
[14:54.860 --> 14:55.380]  Ooh.
[14:56.020 --> 14:57.540]  16 going one.
[14:57.660 --> 14:58.180]  I don't know.
[14:58.320 --> 14:58.980]  I'm gonna need your time.
[14:59.660 --> 15:00.960]  Nah, it comes down at 15.
[15:01.960 --> 15:02.320]  Really?
[15:03.080 --> 15:05.120]  We locking in at 16 for this?
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.560]  I'll go 17.
[15:07.180 --> 15:07.700]  17?
[15:08.020 --> 15:08.280]  Okay.
[15:08.660 --> 15:08.760]  17.
[15:09.360 --> 15:10.820]  Well, that's too rich for my blood.
[15:10.900 --> 15:12.320]  So unless someone wants to go over Eric.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.360]  Eric at 17 going one.
[15:16.580 --> 15:17.100]  Twice.
[15:18.100 --> 15:20.120]  Sold to Eric at 17.
[15:20.880 --> 15:21.240]  I'll take it.
[15:21.260 --> 15:23.500]  That could be a fantastic buy for you.
[15:23.500 --> 15:25.580]  I can easily see that being huge.
[15:25.640 --> 15:26.420]  I can't.
[15:26.500 --> 15:30.060]  I can see it going well, but I can also see it not going.
[15:30.220 --> 15:30.600]  Yes.
[15:31.600 --> 15:32.980]  I think you'll be good.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.880]  I think it's gonna make a bunch.
[15:36.120 --> 15:38.020]  I think it'll make way more internationally.
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.180]  Talk about not striking while the iron's hot.
[15:42.040 --> 15:43.080]  This is...
[15:43.080 --> 15:45.520]  The last one came out in 2000.
[15:46.520 --> 15:47.300]  15, I think.
[15:47.880 --> 15:48.340]  15, 2015.
[15:48.880 --> 15:49.040]  Yeah.
[15:49.260 --> 15:50.900]  Almost 10 years, dude.
[15:50.900 --> 15:54.500]  Look at the gap between the last one and the road or Mad Max.
[15:54.880 --> 15:59.640]  That's true, but like the bigger gap makes me more confident.
[15:59.960 --> 16:01.900]  The smaller gap make me small confident.
[16:02.260 --> 16:05.400]  But to be fair, this one has a better movie behind it than the last one did.
[16:05.700 --> 16:07.320]  That is absolutely true.
[16:07.500 --> 16:10.940]  But that could also lead to a lot of disappointment in what we're about to see,
[16:11.060 --> 16:14.940]  which is Chris Helmsworth in a big fucking nose for some reason.
[16:17.180 --> 16:18.000]  Very weird.
[16:18.100 --> 16:19.080]  Gavin is half of that.
[16:19.750 --> 16:21.840]  Um, next movie.
[16:22.120 --> 16:22.820]  Oh, I'm excited.
[16:23.540 --> 16:25.060]  The Garfield movie.
[16:25.320 --> 16:25.400]  One.
[16:25.520 --> 16:26.120]  I'm immediately...
[16:27.100 --> 16:28.220]  Fuck out of here with one.
[16:28.320 --> 16:29.400]  Ten. I'm putting ten down.
[16:29.440 --> 16:30.360]  Whoa, another Garfield movie.
[16:30.760 --> 16:32.400]  You're out of your fucking mind.
[16:33.080 --> 16:33.320]  Ten.
[16:34.980 --> 16:35.980]  I mean, listen.
[16:36.380 --> 16:37.620]  Didn't they already make one of these?
[16:37.940 --> 16:38.520]  They made several.
[16:38.520 --> 16:39.660]  Calm down to Back to Black.
[16:39.980 --> 16:41.120]  I don't want to hear from you.
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.260]  Garfield is worth more than seven in difference to Back to Black.
[16:45.420 --> 16:45.760]  Okay.
[16:46.040 --> 16:47.220]  There's a wider gap.
[16:47.220 --> 16:51.200]  Now I do want to point out, before we start, like before...
[16:51.200 --> 16:52.920]  He's saying ten. Totally fine.
[16:53.200 --> 16:54.500]  For some reason, you're at 91.
[16:56.260 --> 16:57.500]  And I don't know why that is.
[16:58.220 --> 17:00.320]  I may have taxed him slightly before we started.
[17:03.040 --> 17:07.140]  We'll just... we'll put in a number anyway that reflects to what it would be if I was at 98.
[17:08.200 --> 17:09.620]  Ten. Ten going one.
[17:10.200 --> 17:13.540]  That seems so much worse instead of just changing the top one up to 98.
[17:13.560 --> 17:14.000]  There you go.
[17:14.060 --> 17:15.080]  Oh, that works. Thanks.
[17:15.280 --> 17:15.940]  I am...
[17:15.940 --> 17:16.760]  What? Oh my god!
[17:16.760 --> 17:17.660]  Going twice.
[17:18.020 --> 17:18.380]  Benevolent.
[17:19.140 --> 17:19.620]  Eleven.
[17:20.560 --> 17:22.940]  Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
[17:24.760 --> 17:26.660]  What Garfield cart guy, what do you think?
[17:27.300 --> 17:28.740]  Oh, I really want it.
[17:28.840 --> 17:33.460]  He's got Chris Pratt and Samuel L. Jackson. All your kids' favorite voice actors.
[17:33.600 --> 17:34.940]  Twelve. I'll go twelve.
[17:35.280 --> 17:36.380]  Ooh, twelve.
[17:36.600 --> 17:37.420]  I really want it.
[17:37.840 --> 17:39.680]  I knew it'd be easy to get that dude to bid up.
[17:40.400 --> 17:43.140]  I want it. I gotta have it.
[17:43.660 --> 17:44.120]  Going one.
[17:44.260 --> 17:45.280]  Now you're gonna pay for it.
[17:45.480 --> 17:45.940]  HF.
[17:45.940 --> 17:46.740]  Like a fiddle.
[17:47.020 --> 17:47.460]  Going twice.
[17:48.920 --> 17:49.740]  It's all you.
[17:49.740 --> 17:52.020]  Sold to me. I'm getting Garfield.
[17:52.340 --> 17:53.160]  And you got Garfield.
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.620]  I did. I mean, Chris Pratt is on a run of animated hits.
[17:59.260 --> 18:00.340]  Why would it stop?
[18:00.880 --> 18:01.760]  Jurassic Park.
[18:02.680 --> 18:06.620]  The next film is Sight. I think it's some religious bullshit. I don't know.
[18:06.840 --> 18:07.540]  I don't really know.
[18:08.580 --> 18:09.960]  I think it's a wide release.
[18:10.640 --> 18:13.280]  It is a... I think Greg Kinnear?
[18:13.620 --> 18:15.860]  Yeah, it is. It's a Greg Kinnear vehicle.
[18:15.940 --> 18:18.760]  I'll put one point on the Greg Kinnear vehicle.
[18:18.820 --> 18:19.600]  I'll do two.
[18:21.460 --> 18:23.760]  That's richer than I would pay.
[18:24.780 --> 18:30.400]  I really... are we gonna let Nick have Sight and Back to Black as his first two films?
[18:30.560 --> 18:30.820]  I really guess.
[18:30.820 --> 18:31.440]  Yes, we are.
[18:31.820 --> 18:34.440]  Yeah, absolutely. I don't know who you think we is.
[18:34.620 --> 18:37.040]  I'm getting them at Steele's on the dollar.
[18:38.180 --> 18:39.760]  That's sold to Nick for two points.
[18:39.900 --> 18:41.920]  Excellent. Way to go, buddy.
[18:41.940 --> 18:43.540]  Nick's shopping a Dollar Tree right now.
[18:43.660 --> 18:44.440]  Yeah, baby.
[18:45.180 --> 18:47.140]  This candy is out of date.
[18:47.900 --> 18:51.740]  Okay, next film doesn't even have a box office mojo page,
[18:51.760 --> 18:52.760]  but it is coming out.
[18:52.900 --> 18:55.600]  It is a Bobby kind of Ollie film with Robert De Niro
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.520]  about him having a kid with special needs, I believe.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.260]  Oh, I'll pay all one.
[19:01.360 --> 19:01.620]  One.
[19:02.620 --> 19:03.240]  I'll go two.
[19:03.800 --> 19:04.200]  Three.
[19:04.380 --> 19:05.920]  Oh, is it gonna be Oscar buzz?
[19:07.220 --> 19:08.400]  I'm not going more than three.
[19:08.400 --> 19:15.260]  Also in this movie, Vera Farmiga and Robert De Niro
[19:15.260 --> 19:20.060]  and Rose Byrne and Rainn Wilson and Whoopi Goldberg.
[19:21.020 --> 19:23.080]  But it's also we're just going off box office, right?
[19:23.160 --> 19:26.720]  So Oscar buzz movies typically do shit at the box office anyway.
[19:26.760 --> 19:28.340]  They also don't typically come out in the summer.
[19:28.780 --> 19:30.780]  So what are we at?
[19:31.240 --> 19:32.140]  I think you're at three.
[19:32.400 --> 19:32.900]  I'm at three.
[19:33.300 --> 19:35.040]  Going once, going twice. Anybody? No?
[19:36.700 --> 19:37.420]  Sold to Jeff.
[19:38.340 --> 19:39.240]  Congratulations, Jeff.
[19:39.260 --> 19:39.940]  I didn't know I could.
[19:40.040 --> 19:42.500]  I didn't know I could control the numbers.
[19:44.040 --> 19:45.920]  We had the whole discussion at the beginning
[19:45.920 --> 19:48.880]  and then I started writing far and I changed Andrew's score down.
[19:52.800 --> 19:55.720]  OK, next film is I don't really know anything about this.
[19:55.960 --> 19:59.060]  It's called Haikyuu Kyuu, The Dumpster Battle.
[19:59.340 --> 20:00.960]  This is released overseas.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.800]  Did actually really well overseas.
[20:02.980 --> 20:04.540]  Well, I mean, like 65 million.
[20:04.820 --> 20:05.280]  Does that count?
[20:05.500 --> 20:08.460]  This is the no, but this is the North American release.
[20:08.980 --> 20:10.800]  Of it to the one point.
[20:11.120 --> 20:12.420]  OK, I already said to Andrew.
[20:12.560 --> 20:13.520]  Don't wow. Yeah, you beat me.
[20:13.640 --> 20:14.360]  You have lost it.
[20:14.440 --> 20:16.140]  Your neck, your number has to go above my number.
[20:16.240 --> 20:16.480]  Get real.
[20:16.720 --> 20:18.120]  Yeah, that is factual.
[20:18.500 --> 20:21.000]  Does anyone want to get involved in this dumpster battle?
[20:21.260 --> 20:21.740]  That's OK.
[20:22.340 --> 20:25.380]  No. OK, going once or twice.
[20:25.840 --> 20:27.480]  Sold to Eric for two.
[20:28.020 --> 20:30.780]  I think this one's going to be an underdog for me.
[20:30.820 --> 20:31.400]  I think it's going to.
[20:31.460 --> 20:35.100]  I think they're going to do not like huge wide releases here,
[20:35.120 --> 20:38.900]  but I think they'll do like those one night only things or whatever.
[20:38.980 --> 20:40.620]  And I think it'll do decent.
[20:40.760 --> 20:43.460]  I think if you get like 10 million out of that for two points,
[20:43.580 --> 20:44.520]  that's that's nothing wrong.
[20:44.560 --> 20:46.760]  I definitely, I definitely think that's what's going to be.
[20:46.840 --> 20:48.880]  Are you going to write down the points for Eric?
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.400]  Nobody's written down the points yet.
[20:52.720 --> 20:53.780]  Two, thank you.
[20:55.120 --> 20:58.380]  I was locked in a bad boys ride or die thinking about if TPG was here,
[20:58.420 --> 21:01.060]  we got 98 points going bad boys ride or die.
[21:01.240 --> 21:02.480]  You think he'd throw it out on 98?
[21:02.760 --> 21:03.720]  Oh, yeah, I think.
[21:03.860 --> 21:06.200]  I mean, by the way, Kevin has no movies right now.
[21:06.220 --> 21:06.780]  I got three.
[21:07.220 --> 21:08.840]  Well, I don't want to let pilot dog show.
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.440]  I'm going big.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.580]  Oh, is this is this your money?
[21:11.720 --> 21:14.320]  You go get any bigger than bad boys.
[21:14.440 --> 21:14.700]  Seven.
[21:15.020 --> 21:15.420]  I want one.
[21:15.900 --> 21:16.560]  I'm mad.
[21:16.760 --> 21:20.640]  I want to making them now and not in like 2005 when we wanted them.
[21:20.880 --> 21:21.480]  Oh, totally agree.
[21:21.580 --> 21:21.700]  Yeah.
[21:21.720 --> 21:22.120]  When we want.
[21:22.220 --> 21:22.300]  Yeah.
[21:22.360 --> 21:24.200]  I get striking while the iron is not hot.
[21:24.460 --> 21:27.300]  When they get when they could jump over a fence still.
[21:27.680 --> 21:28.120]  Yep.
[21:29.380 --> 21:30.200]  I got eight.
[21:31.020 --> 21:31.780]  You put eight.
[21:32.540 --> 21:33.320]  I put eight down.
[21:34.080 --> 21:34.520]  Interesting.
[21:36.400 --> 21:36.720]  Twelve.
[21:37.760 --> 21:38.180]  Whoa.
[21:40.540 --> 21:42.720]  Listen, I'm not paying a Garfield for it.
[21:42.800 --> 21:43.860]  I'm out at 12.
[21:44.160 --> 21:45.740]  Gavin with 12 going once.
[21:46.400 --> 21:47.900]  Jerry Bruckheimer produced.
[21:48.380 --> 21:50.320]  Going with Gavin 12 twice.
[21:51.020 --> 21:51.740]  My mouth broke.
[21:52.280 --> 21:53.740]  Sold to Gavin at 12.
[21:53.840 --> 21:54.160]  All right.
[21:54.440 --> 21:55.860]  Nice way to go, Gavin.
[21:55.940 --> 21:56.560]  Well done, Gavin.
[21:56.660 --> 21:57.580]  And D box.
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.000]  Oh, DX, baby, man.
[22:00.180 --> 22:01.830]  I go see it with you, but I don't want to help you.
[22:03.660 --> 22:04.600]  We'll sneak in.
[22:04.800 --> 22:05.540]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:06.340 --> 22:08.000]  Next movie is The Watchers.
[22:08.240 --> 22:11.340]  I believe it is directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter.
[22:11.740 --> 22:13.180]  Weird horror looking thing.
[22:13.500 --> 22:16.000]  Oh, I'll put three points down.
[22:16.720 --> 22:16.880]  Three.
[22:17.120 --> 22:17.400]  All right.
[22:17.700 --> 22:18.180]  I'll do.
[22:18.300 --> 22:18.960]  You can't.
[22:19.220 --> 22:19.740]  I'm a bully.
[22:20.600 --> 22:21.600]  Jeff's at four.
[22:21.800 --> 22:22.600]  I'll go five.
[22:23.220 --> 22:23.620]  Oh.
[22:25.440 --> 22:27.300]  No, it's a Warner Brothers picture.
[22:28.560 --> 22:29.420]  Ah, fuck.
[22:30.480 --> 22:32.500]  Uh, five going once.
[22:34.200 --> 22:34.880]  I'm going twice.
[22:34.880 --> 22:36.220]  I just don't want it.
[22:37.200 --> 22:37.260]  Sold.
[22:37.780 --> 22:38.860]  You fooled me.
[22:39.420 --> 22:40.580]  We got to get you a little gavel.
[22:41.760 --> 22:42.900]  I do need a little gavel.
[22:43.040 --> 22:43.560]  I have one.
[22:43.680 --> 22:44.180]  You want me to use?
[22:44.300 --> 22:45.140]  Do you want me to use it?
[22:45.360 --> 22:47.020]  Wouldn't Discord just clip it out?
[22:47.640 --> 22:49.360]  Whatever address is sold, you just whack it.
[22:49.820 --> 22:50.480]  Do you want me to whack it?
[22:50.500 --> 22:51.340]  Okay, hang on just a second.
[22:54.460 --> 22:55.020]  There it is.
[22:55.420 --> 22:57.160]  Oh, that's great.
[22:57.300 --> 22:57.620]  It's great.
[22:57.820 --> 22:57.920]  Okay.
[22:58.000 --> 22:58.400]  That's fantastic.
[22:59.060 --> 22:59.800]  I have a gavel.
[22:59.800 --> 23:00.440]  Yeah, come on.
[23:00.680 --> 23:02.000]  Inside out two.
[23:02.120 --> 23:02.400]  One.
[23:03.540 --> 23:03.860]  Ten.
[23:03.940 --> 23:04.260]  Six.
[23:04.260 --> 23:04.900]  Twenty.
[23:04.980 --> 23:05.740]  Goddamn ten.
[23:05.860 --> 23:06.000]  What?
[23:06.200 --> 23:06.640]  Twenty-one.
[23:07.880 --> 23:08.780]  Twenty-five.
[23:08.920 --> 23:09.520]  They're right to play.
[23:09.520 --> 23:10.260]  Twenty-seven.
[23:10.840 --> 23:11.340]  Thirty.
[23:12.240 --> 23:13.220]  Thirty-five.
[23:13.560 --> 23:14.020]  Forty.
[23:19.440 --> 23:20.440]  Forty-four.
[23:21.160 --> 23:21.660]  Whoa!
[23:22.580 --> 23:22.840]  Wow.
[23:23.700 --> 23:24.240]  Forty-five.
[23:27.760 --> 23:31.640]  Gavin just pulled his dick out of his pants and showed it to you.
[23:31.800 --> 23:33.980]  Come on, you got forty-six in there, Andrew, or what?
[23:33.980 --> 23:35.260]  No, I don't, I don't.
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.080]  No's too big for me.
[23:37.420 --> 23:39.020]  All right, Nick, do you want to jump in here?
[23:39.860 --> 23:40.220]  Nope.
[23:41.040 --> 23:41.440]  What?
[23:41.840 --> 23:43.440]  Okay, it's going once.
[23:44.660 --> 23:45.460]  Going twice.
[23:46.560 --> 23:48.180]  Sold to Gavin at forty-five.
[23:48.480 --> 23:49.800]  That's how the old wallet...
[23:49.800 --> 23:51.220]  They also didn't strike when the iron was hot.
[23:53.380 --> 23:56.380]  But like, there's no way that's not one of the biggest movies of the summer.
[23:56.420 --> 23:57.880]  No, that is a huge film.
[23:58.020 --> 23:59.560]  It's gonna be a great use of money.
[23:59.660 --> 24:00.800]  It's gonna be huge.
[24:01.220 --> 24:02.160]  Pixar sequel.
[24:03.100 --> 24:04.360]  Uh, next movie.
[24:04.820 --> 24:11.360]  Okay, now, Bike Riders is an Austin Butler vehicle.
[24:12.060 --> 24:17.620]  Also has Norman Reedus, Michael Shannon, and Tom Hardy.
[24:17.900 --> 24:18.120]  One.
[24:18.680 --> 24:22.720]  It is a motorcycle movie.
[24:23.260 --> 24:29.120]  And my understanding is that this movie came out in, like, limited release last year.
[24:29.680 --> 24:30.000]  And...
[24:30.000 --> 24:30.180]  Oh, really?
[24:30.360 --> 24:31.940]  Yeah, but it's released, I think.
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.540]  And then it's releasing wide.
[24:34.160 --> 24:35.240]  How'd they come up with that name?
[24:35.480 --> 24:37.860]  Right, it's kind of lame for a motorcycle movie.
[24:38.260 --> 24:39.720]  It's incredibly lame.
[24:39.980 --> 24:41.780]  No, it has nothing to do with motorcycles, actually.
[24:44.180 --> 24:46.520]  Okay, so what do you guys think?
[24:46.800 --> 24:47.480]  Bike Riders.
[24:47.780 --> 24:49.940]  What if Fast and Furious was called The Car Drivers?
[24:52.420 --> 24:54.700]  I'd be watching Car Drivers 9, baby.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.380]  You mean Drive?
[24:56.560 --> 24:57.980]  Or Baby Driver?
[24:57.980 --> 24:58.780]  Oh!
[25:00.140 --> 25:02.140]  Um, Bike Riders, I'll put two.
[25:02.820 --> 25:03.440]  I'll do three.
[25:03.560 --> 25:05.200]  Oh, okay.
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.140]  Well, that's beyond me now.
[25:06.560 --> 25:07.380]  Nick at three.
[25:07.920 --> 25:08.920]  I'll do Bike Riders.
[25:09.560 --> 25:10.260]  Jeff at four.
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.440]  Anyone at five?
[25:13.120 --> 25:14.280]  Jeff currently leading with four.
[25:15.020 --> 25:16.700]  Austin Butler vehicle, Mr. Elvis.
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.460]  I was gonna say, it's tough because I want to.
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.960]  But boy, I just don't think it's gonna crush.
[25:24.260 --> 25:26.760]  I just don't think it's gonna bring in enough money.
[25:26.760 --> 25:30.340]  I think it'll be acclaimed in some circles, but I just don't think it's gonna bring in the money.
[25:30.600 --> 25:31.940]  Then Bike Riders going twice.
[25:32.140 --> 25:32.520]  Dump it up.
[25:33.800 --> 25:35.000]  Bike Riders sold to Jeff.
[25:35.080 --> 25:35.640]  What was that, four?
[25:36.160 --> 25:36.780]  Yeah, four for Jeff.
[25:36.780 --> 25:37.420]  Four for Jeff.
[25:38.100 --> 25:38.280]  Yep.
[25:38.640 --> 25:39.720]  Like, not a bad one.
[25:39.760 --> 25:41.920]  You just deleted my one above you.
[25:42.100 --> 25:42.280]  Sure did.
[25:42.500 --> 25:43.500]  What the hell, dude?
[25:43.900 --> 25:44.880]  Yep, I sure did.
[25:45.320 --> 25:45.680]  Come on!
[25:46.360 --> 25:48.340]  While I appreciate it, I'm not trying to cheat here.
[25:48.480 --> 25:48.580]  Nope.
[25:49.640 --> 25:50.240]  I am.
[25:53.740 --> 25:54.540]  Janet Planet?
[25:55.060 --> 25:55.920]  I don't know it.
[25:56.900 --> 26:03.740]  Enthralled by her own imagination, 11-year-old Lacey spends the long summer at home with her
[26:03.740 --> 26:11.320]  mother and three strangers. Julianne Nicholson, Zoe Ziegler, Elias Koteas?
[26:11.420 --> 26:12.720]  That's the only guy that I'm familiar with.
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.580]  Elias Koteas, yeah.
[26:13.860 --> 26:15.620]  Koteas, yeah, that guy. Yeah, yeah, that guy.
[26:16.020 --> 26:18.480]  And that's sort of it, rounding out the cast.
[26:18.760 --> 26:19.940]  I'd like to rescind my one.
[26:20.980 --> 26:21.920]  You can't.
[26:22.200 --> 26:23.640]  One is on the board for Nick.
[26:23.780 --> 26:24.240]  No!
[26:24.980 --> 26:27.840]  Elias Koteas is the guy who's almost Christopher Meloni.
[26:28.160 --> 26:30.540]  Yes, he is. That's a great descriptor of him.
[26:30.720 --> 26:32.460]  I'll put two down on this.
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.300]  Oh, sweet. Thank you for saving me.
[26:34.360 --> 26:37.960]  Eric putting two down on Janet Planet. I don't think anyone else wants it beyond that.
[26:38.080 --> 26:39.160]  Just me, not Nick.
[26:40.500 --> 26:42.540]  Eric gets Janet Planet at two.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.960]  Yeah, I'm fine with that. I got no problem with that.
[26:45.940 --> 26:47.640]  Next film, Blue Lock.
[26:47.780 --> 26:48.160]  One!
[26:48.760 --> 26:49.600]  Episode... okay.
[26:50.740 --> 26:52.320]  What the fuck?
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.240]  So once again, another one of these anime movies that released internationally.
[26:57.420 --> 27:00.960]  This one did not nearly nearly as good as The Dumpster Battle.
[27:01.640 --> 27:02.920]  I'm not going to put two in.
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.700]  I think, Nick, you might have this at one.
[27:05.920 --> 27:07.800]  You might have the only one purchase.
[27:08.240 --> 27:08.820]  We good with that?
[27:09.240 --> 27:09.660]  No, I'm good.
[27:10.140 --> 27:12.820]  Okay, so you bought one from Nick.
[27:13.080 --> 27:15.060]  Gavin, could I convince you otherwise?
[27:16.540 --> 27:19.540]  Nick has bought four films for a total of eight points.
[27:19.680 --> 27:21.300]  He really is at the dollarama.
[27:21.500 --> 27:22.200]  That's good value.
[27:22.320 --> 27:23.820]  Great value.
[27:24.080 --> 27:25.400]  He's got 90 bucks left.
[27:25.700 --> 27:27.460]  We have now moved on to...
[27:30.900 --> 27:37.900]  Kevin Costner's three-hour, two-part, Wild West epic, Horizon, and American Saga, chapter one.
[27:38.400 --> 27:38.720]  Ten.
[27:39.260 --> 27:39.900]  Ten?
[27:40.360 --> 27:43.560]  Holy shit.
[27:43.940 --> 27:44.900]  I think Nick said 11.
[27:45.080 --> 27:45.520]  I did.
[27:46.240 --> 27:46.820]  Wow.
[27:47.340 --> 27:48.100]  I'll go 15.
[27:48.500 --> 27:49.260]  Oh shit!
[27:49.740 --> 27:51.400]  He looks like a stinker.
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.540]  Gavin, they're crazy, right?
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.460]  I'll go 19.
[27:55.800 --> 27:57.580]  I wouldn't have gone above four for this, I think.
[27:57.640 --> 27:58.780]  I'll go 22.
[27:59.680 --> 28:00.140]  Wow!
[28:00.860 --> 28:02.160]  They know something I don't.
[28:03.600 --> 28:05.080]  Jeff with the top bid at 22.
[28:05.740 --> 28:06.460]  Going once.
[28:07.280 --> 28:08.120]  Going twice.
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.200]  Sold to Jeff for 22 points.
[28:11.400 --> 28:17.100]  Dude, Kevin Costner is so fucking hot right now with all that cowboy shit and Yellowstone and all that stuff.
[28:17.380 --> 28:19.780]  There's no way I'm not betting on Yellowstone.
[28:19.780 --> 28:22.800]  There's no way I'm not betting on fucking Fox.
[28:23.320 --> 28:25.800]  That's all they show is Kevin Costner commercials.
[28:25.940 --> 28:27.500]  It has a colon and a hyphen.
[28:28.080 --> 28:30.280]  I mean, it is part one.
[28:31.140 --> 28:34.680]  The rest of the movie doesn't come out until later this year.
[28:35.140 --> 28:38.660]  This is also Kevin Costner while going through a divorce, I believe.
[28:39.200 --> 28:41.880]  And the budget is a hundred million dollars.
[28:44.720 --> 28:45.800]  Very strange.
[28:46.080 --> 28:47.260]  Will it be The Postman?
[28:47.340 --> 28:49.580]  Maybe, but it might be Dances with Wolves.
[28:50.360 --> 28:52.040]  I'm ready to take the chance.
[28:52.520 --> 28:54.960]  Okay, Kevin Costner is hot right now.
[28:55.140 --> 28:56.660]  Quiet Place, day one.
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.580]  Oh, they're still making Quiet Place movie.
[28:58.740 --> 29:00.060]  Ten, wow, ten.
[29:00.600 --> 29:01.440]  Ten points.
[29:02.220 --> 29:03.320]  Oh man, there's a time.
[29:03.480 --> 29:07.700]  If you add up what Nick has spent.
[29:10.280 --> 29:11.600]  Doesn't even reach ten.
[29:12.740 --> 29:13.780]  Yeah, I'm okay.
[29:14.160 --> 29:16.160]  Yeah, Quiet Place two or whatever.
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.180]  You know the movie.
[29:17.680 --> 29:19.180]  Going once for Nick at ten.
[29:19.180 --> 29:21.860]  Just striking when the iron is ice cold.
[29:22.120 --> 29:24.440]  Like going twice at ten for Nick.
[29:24.780 --> 29:25.800]  The second one did well, I think.
[29:26.020 --> 29:28.440]  Yeah, sold to Nick at ten.
[29:28.620 --> 29:28.840]  Hell yeah.
[29:29.160 --> 29:30.400]  He finally has a real movie.
[29:30.620 --> 29:31.660]  Congratulations to Nick.
[29:31.680 --> 29:32.360]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, fuck you.
[29:37.380 --> 29:39.100]  Now, ten.
[29:39.200 --> 29:39.780]  Maybe the book.
[29:40.540 --> 29:42.760]  Despicable before, twenty.
[29:45.200 --> 29:46.160]  Twenty-one.
[29:47.420 --> 29:48.320]  Twenty-two.
[29:49.380 --> 29:50.080]  Twenty-five.
[29:51.600 --> 29:52.780]  It's going to make a lot of money.
[29:52.840 --> 29:53.320]  You son of a bitch.
[29:53.460 --> 29:53.760]  Twenty-six.
[29:53.780 --> 29:54.120]  Twenty-eight.
[29:54.620 --> 29:54.900]  Ah!
[29:55.260 --> 29:55.680]  Twenty-nine.
[29:57.400 --> 29:58.280]  Thirty-one.
[30:00.960 --> 30:01.620]  Thirty-two.
[30:03.460 --> 30:04.680]  You know what it's going to be?
[30:05.620 --> 30:06.420]  Wait, you guys finish this.
[30:06.780 --> 30:07.140]  Thirty-four.
[30:08.020 --> 30:08.680]  Forty-one.
[30:09.480 --> 30:09.920]  Whoa!
[30:11.700 --> 30:13.420]  Knock some out if this is it.
[30:13.860 --> 30:16.740]  If you let him have it, Gavin is out.
[30:19.820 --> 30:22.200]  Consider, consider what Gavin already has.
[30:22.380 --> 30:23.240]  How many things are left here?
[30:24.120 --> 30:24.800]  Ah, shit.
[30:24.840 --> 30:25.820]  I'm going to say forty-two.
[30:26.460 --> 30:26.880]  Forty-three.
[30:27.680 --> 30:29.080]  Sorry, Gavin.
[30:29.360 --> 30:30.940]  Forty-three, forty-three, forty-three.
[30:31.200 --> 30:31.560]  Wow.
[30:34.760 --> 30:36.520]  Forty, forty-five.
[30:37.520 --> 30:38.040]  Whoa.
[30:38.620 --> 30:39.880]  I want these minions.
[30:40.340 --> 30:40.980]  Forty-six.
[30:42.640 --> 30:43.580]  Oh my god.
[30:43.920 --> 30:45.380]  Finally can have the lunchbox money too.
[30:46.020 --> 30:46.780]  Forty-eight.
[30:47.880 --> 30:49.400]  This is crazy.
[30:49.940 --> 30:52.320]  It's going to make three hundred million dollars.
[30:52.440 --> 30:52.840]  Forty-nine.
[30:53.960 --> 30:54.600]  Fifty.
[30:55.260 --> 30:56.760]  I think it's more than that.
[30:57.500 --> 30:57.880]  Fifty-one.
[30:59.480 --> 31:00.500]  Fifty-four.
[31:07.220 --> 31:08.140]  Fifty-eight.
[31:09.080 --> 31:09.560]  Whoa!
[31:12.160 --> 31:12.840]  Sixty.
[31:13.240 --> 31:13.940]  Fuck you!
[31:16.280 --> 31:18.720]  This got interesting.
[31:19.300 --> 31:20.680]  Hold on, let me look at the list.
[31:21.960 --> 31:23.820]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[31:25.800 --> 31:26.960]  Sixty going one.
[31:27.420 --> 31:27.840]  Sixty-one.
[31:28.900 --> 31:29.680]  Sixty-two.
[31:30.880 --> 31:31.580]  Sixty-three.
[31:34.100 --> 31:37.240]  Nick, you could take Andrew all the way up to eighty and he's still going to put it in.
[31:37.700 --> 31:38.500]  Sixty-four.
[31:38.720 --> 31:39.040]  Eighty.
[31:44.380 --> 31:47.560]  Nick just took Gavin's dick out and waved it around.
[31:47.660 --> 31:49.960]  All right, Andrew, this is your shot.
[31:50.500 --> 31:50.920]  Wow.
[31:51.600 --> 31:51.960]  Eighty.
[31:53.060 --> 31:54.940]  You get eighty-one this thing or what?
[31:54.960 --> 31:56.720]  This is amazing.
[31:57.380 --> 31:58.880]  No, I think I'm good, Nick.
[31:58.920 --> 31:59.780]  You get it at eighty.
[32:00.000 --> 32:01.660]  Nick is out of the game.
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.760]  Holy shit.
[32:04.240 --> 32:06.740]  Nick is somehow out of the game and has the most movies.
[32:07.600 --> 32:10.300]  Nick's spending is insane.
[32:10.560 --> 32:11.420]  It is ridiculous.
[32:11.740 --> 32:14.300]  Three, two, one, ten, eighty.
[32:17.480 --> 32:18.440]  Absolutely amazing.
[32:18.640 --> 32:20.360]  I bet it's going to pay off tremendously.
[32:20.360 --> 32:21.540]  Oh, absolutely.
[32:21.800 --> 32:28.080]  Let me say, sort of not sure about this auction to begin with, love this format.
[32:28.580 --> 32:32.320]  What else can we do this for?
[32:32.620 --> 32:36.220]  I am so excited not only to find out who wins,
[32:36.500 --> 32:42.060]  but when we get to look over the data and figure out who had the worst bet on a movie,
[32:42.200 --> 32:44.040]  like who lost the most percentage-wise,
[32:44.280 --> 32:49.220]  and then what was like the most, like the two dollar movie that made eight hundred million dollars.
[32:49.220 --> 32:52.920]  We should have a video where we sit around a conference table
[32:52.920 --> 32:55.620]  as if we're the studios and deal with our losses.
[32:56.080 --> 32:56.760]  I love that.
[32:57.940 --> 33:01.540]  Okay, next up, Nick is out.
[33:01.940 --> 33:02.880]  Nick is out.
[33:02.980 --> 33:06.420]  Next movie is Maxine, triple X on the Maxine.
[33:06.800 --> 33:07.960]  It's an A24 film.
[33:08.320 --> 33:09.360]  That's about all I know.
[33:10.660 --> 33:16.830]  Three, four, five, seven.
[33:17.440 --> 33:17.770]  Whoa!
[33:20.210 --> 33:21.370]  Seven going one.
[33:23.090 --> 33:24.330]  Seven going twice.
[33:24.790 --> 33:25.030]  Eight.
[33:26.330 --> 33:26.790]  Whoa!
[33:28.030 --> 33:29.750]  Too rich for my blood.
[33:30.090 --> 33:31.570]  It's going to do well.
[33:31.590 --> 33:32.110]  Eight going one.
[33:32.430 --> 33:33.070]  I, yep.
[33:33.450 --> 33:34.050]  Eight going twice.
[33:35.150 --> 33:35.610]  Sold there.
[33:36.170 --> 33:38.250]  It's like the third movie in a series.
[33:38.750 --> 33:40.190]  Mia Goth movie thing.
[33:40.350 --> 33:40.750]  It's, yeah.
[33:41.010 --> 33:45.370]  I think those movies suck out loud.
[33:45.370 --> 33:46.850]  And people love them.
[33:47.090 --> 33:48.870]  So I know I'm wrong.
[33:49.030 --> 33:51.750]  And I got no problem winning some money on it, baby.
[33:52.150 --> 33:53.110]  Guys, let's do it.
[33:53.390 --> 33:54.770]  Fly me to the moon.
[33:55.290 --> 33:59.370]  This is a Channing Tatum, Scarlett Johansson film about the moon landing being fake.
[33:59.490 --> 33:59.850]  I believe.
[34:00.670 --> 34:00.930]  Yes.
[34:01.790 --> 34:02.690]  Sort of fake.
[34:02.790 --> 34:06.630]  Like them filming the moon landing in the event that it doesn't work or something.
[34:06.850 --> 34:07.650]  I think is the idea.
[34:08.410 --> 34:10.070]  I want to say this might be an Apple movie.
[34:10.770 --> 34:11.210]  I'll put one.
[34:11.610 --> 34:13.110]  Apple love a good moon movie.
[34:14.190 --> 34:14.910]  Moon movie?
[34:15.750 --> 34:16.730]  Andrew, did you say one?
[34:17.050 --> 34:17.810]  I said one.
[34:17.950 --> 34:19.270]  I'm putting one on fly me to the moon.
[34:20.850 --> 34:21.250]  Two.
[34:21.410 --> 34:21.590]  I'll go two.
[34:22.210 --> 34:22.610]  Three.
[34:22.770 --> 34:23.170]  Ooh.
[34:23.630 --> 34:25.730]  Ooh, Andrew with four.
[34:26.390 --> 34:26.790]  Intrigue.
[34:26.890 --> 34:27.270]  I'll go four.
[34:28.930 --> 34:29.770]  Four going once.
[34:31.190 --> 34:31.830]  Four going twice.
[34:33.610 --> 34:34.630]  I got it at four.
[34:36.370 --> 34:38.790]  I have zero enthusiasm about that movie.
[34:38.850 --> 34:38.930]  Oh, yeah.
[34:39.190 --> 34:39.210]  Whatever.
[34:39.310 --> 34:40.050]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:40.090 --> 34:40.670]  No, it's four.
[34:41.710 --> 34:45.310]  Reese's peanut butter cups are the greatest, but let me play devil's advocate here.
[34:45.310 --> 34:47.910]  So, no, that's a good thing.
[34:49.210 --> 34:50.690]  That's definitely not a problem.
[34:51.730 --> 34:53.050]  Reese's, you did it.
[34:53.190 --> 34:54.970]  You stumped this charming devil.

[35:34.630 --> 35:38.730]  it is rumored to be a David Chase Terrence Winter Horror film.
[35:39.230 --> 35:39.570]  One.
[35:41.410 --> 35:42.850]  But that's it's a rumor.
[35:42.850 --> 35:44.670]  It's not a like it is not.
[35:44.830 --> 35:45.390]  Yeah, you are.
[35:45.530 --> 35:46.770]  It could easily move out.
[35:46.950 --> 35:52.130]  And if I have a summer, I understand that I'm taking a I'm taking a risk here with my one.
[35:52.230 --> 35:55.230]  If one of these gets delayed beyond summer, do we get a refund?
[35:55.670 --> 35:56.610]  No, you're just fucked.
[35:56.690 --> 35:57.890]  You just don't get that movie.
[35:58.410 --> 35:59.770]  Yeah. Oh, one.
[36:00.430 --> 36:01.410]  I'll do one on this one.
[36:03.030 --> 36:04.830]  I think Eric's going to or Jeff's going to get it.
[36:05.270 --> 36:05.470]  Yeah.
[36:06.530 --> 36:08.310]  Yeah, I just wouldn't play at one.
[36:08.410 --> 36:09.550]  I just wouldn't put anything on it.
[36:09.630 --> 36:11.710]  Hey, it's a hell of a lottery ticket for one.
[36:11.710 --> 36:13.110]  Yeah, it comes out.
[36:13.250 --> 36:13.990]  You're in a great position.
[36:14.090 --> 36:16.010]  What do we what do you what were you saying?
[36:16.030 --> 36:16.610]  You think it was?
[36:17.570 --> 36:21.530]  It is supposed to be David Chase Terrence Winter Horror film.
[36:22.790 --> 36:25.550]  When I looked into it, I'm just going to note it here.
[36:25.590 --> 36:26.590]  So that way we remember.
[36:26.790 --> 36:28.690]  But yeah, that's great.
[36:29.390 --> 36:31.030]  Next film, which makes me sad.
[36:31.290 --> 36:31.690]  Twisters.
[36:32.190 --> 36:32.870]  Oh boy.
[36:33.510 --> 36:35.330]  Is it a trailer for this yet?
[36:35.570 --> 36:36.470]  No, no, I haven't.
[36:37.150 --> 36:37.490]  It is.
[36:37.590 --> 36:41.450]  Yeah, it's a sequel in a way.
[36:41.710 --> 36:43.370]  It just seems like it's another.
[36:43.870 --> 36:45.410]  It seems like it's the same movie.
[36:46.590 --> 36:48.070]  It is very bizarre.
[36:49.390 --> 36:54.350]  I feel like the title implies that it is a continuation, but everybody is dead.
[36:54.410 --> 36:56.510]  Sadly, that was in that first movie.
[36:56.830 --> 36:57.230]  So yeah.
[36:57.670 --> 36:58.930]  Helen Hunt's not dead, is she?
[36:59.110 --> 36:59.990]  Helen Hunt is not dead.
[37:00.190 --> 37:01.710]  But Phil Seymour Hoffman's dead.
[37:03.330 --> 37:04.330]  Bill Paxton.
[37:04.950 --> 37:05.610]  Paxton's dead.
[37:05.890 --> 37:06.750]  His son's in it though.
[37:07.270 --> 37:08.310]  That cow died.
[37:08.850 --> 37:09.370]  The cow's dead.
[37:10.410 --> 37:12.370]  I'll put two on it.
[37:14.490 --> 37:15.690]  I'll put...
[37:15.690 --> 37:16.690]  Ah, I don't know.
[37:16.770 --> 37:17.030]  I'm good.
[37:17.450 --> 37:18.790]  I'll put nothing on it.
[37:20.630 --> 37:21.230]  Four.
[37:22.290 --> 37:22.610]  Four.
[37:23.030 --> 37:24.110]  Jeff with four.
[37:25.950 --> 37:27.530]  Jeff with four going once.
[37:27.650 --> 37:29.270]  It's got that nostalgia factor.
[37:29.970 --> 37:30.630]  It does.
[37:30.830 --> 37:32.390]  Jeff with four going twice.
[37:32.870 --> 37:33.290]  Five.
[37:34.310 --> 37:34.910]  Nice.
[37:36.630 --> 37:37.030]  Six.
[37:37.210 --> 37:37.650]  Six.
[37:38.110 --> 37:39.090]  Oh, seven.
[37:39.850 --> 37:40.290]  Okay.
[37:42.390 --> 37:43.830]  This might make some money.
[37:44.110 --> 37:44.790]  Like, this really...
[37:44.790 --> 37:46.050]  This has everyone...
[37:46.050 --> 37:48.810]  Like, this has the human Capybara guy in it.
[37:49.130 --> 37:50.610]  Yeah, and it's a sequel.
[37:50.870 --> 37:54.730]  And it's happening at a time when climate is a big issue too, you know?
[37:54.810 --> 37:57.310]  Let me look up the release date because I bet it's July 4th weekend.
[37:58.150 --> 37:59.650]  Oh, fuck me if it is.
[38:00.190 --> 38:01.010]  July 19th.
[38:01.010 --> 38:01.550]  It's close.
[38:01.790 --> 38:02.550]  July 19th.
[38:04.370 --> 38:04.810]  Seven.
[38:05.530 --> 38:06.390]  Holding my seven.
[38:07.690 --> 38:08.370]  Seven going one.
[38:10.190 --> 38:11.170]  Seven going two.
[38:11.810 --> 38:11.950]  Eight.
[38:12.870 --> 38:13.610]  Fuck you.
[38:15.510 --> 38:16.030]  Nine.
[38:16.690 --> 38:17.850]  Ooh, there you go.
[38:19.430 --> 38:20.390]  Nine going one.
[38:21.930 --> 38:22.790]  Nine going twice.
[38:24.950 --> 38:26.090]  What was that?
[38:26.250 --> 38:27.090]  Did he say a number?
[38:27.830 --> 38:28.470]  Did he say a number?
[38:29.210 --> 38:30.050]  I just made a noise.
[38:30.510 --> 38:31.010]  Oh, okay.
[38:31.430 --> 38:33.670]  Okay, sold to me at nine.
[38:34.330 --> 38:34.570]  Got it.
[38:35.530 --> 38:36.930]  Oh, it went...
[38:36.930 --> 38:39.690]  I couldn't tell if that was the back end of a 10.
[38:41.290 --> 38:44.610]  Next film, Deadpool and Wolverine.
[38:45.190 --> 38:45.670]  41.
[38:46.930 --> 38:47.770]  42.
[38:48.290 --> 38:49.310]  Oh, shit.
[38:53.020 --> 38:54.660]  42 going once.
[38:54.800 --> 38:57.000]  This is going to save the MCU and...
[38:57.460 --> 38:57.700]  Yep.
[38:58.040 --> 38:58.700]  45.
[38:59.780 --> 39:00.540]  48.
[39:01.180 --> 39:02.020]  50.
[39:02.420 --> 39:03.100]  67.
[39:03.860 --> 39:04.700]  68.
[39:06.360 --> 39:06.980]  Andrew's out.
[39:08.600 --> 39:09.640]  A great move, in my opinion.
[39:10.220 --> 39:12.100]  Yeah, I mean, it had to be.
[39:13.900 --> 39:14.840]  It's going to...
[39:14.840 --> 39:16.700]  It's getting to a situation where there are too many points left.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.280]  I was waiting.
[39:19.500 --> 39:24.580]  I needed you guys to push him more on twisters, but I knew he wasn't going to go higher.
[39:24.740 --> 39:25.620]  No, exactly.
[39:25.680 --> 39:27.380]  I knew he wanted...
[39:27.380 --> 39:28.160]  No shit.
[39:28.460 --> 39:30.900]  Because we knew you wanted Deadpool and Wolverine,
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  because you had to stay one point higher than me in order to do it.
[39:34.380 --> 39:34.820]  Clearly.
[39:34.820 --> 39:36.560]  The most obvious thing ever.
[39:37.280 --> 39:37.400]  Clearly.
[39:38.380 --> 39:39.120]  What is DeeDee?
[39:39.780 --> 39:42.680]  DeeDee is a movie that takes place in 2008.
[39:42.780 --> 39:45.260]  I watched a trailer for it this morning about a boy,
[39:46.360 --> 39:51.300]  Asian-American boy who isn't really sure who he is as a teenager in like 2008.
[39:51.440 --> 39:51.920]  So he starts...
[39:51.920 --> 39:52.580]  It's like...
[39:52.580 --> 39:53.220]  What was that movie?
[39:53.340 --> 39:53.960]  Mid-90s?
[39:54.020 --> 39:54.840]  It kind of looks like that.
[39:55.140 --> 39:55.840]  But like 2008.
[39:56.460 --> 39:56.760]  One.
[39:57.660 --> 39:58.060]  Two.
[40:01.050 --> 40:02.030]  Two going once.
[40:03.590 --> 40:04.650]  Two going twice.
[40:05.270 --> 40:06.590]  Sold to Eric with two.
[40:09.650 --> 40:10.770]  I'm gonna get some...
[40:11.270 --> 40:13.370]  I'm gonna get stuck with some dregs here.
[40:14.930 --> 40:16.830]  So next up we got Fabulous 4.
[40:16.950 --> 40:18.770]  There wasn't a box office mojo page for it.
[40:19.030 --> 40:20.570]  It is a Bette Midler film.
[40:21.390 --> 40:26.290]  The Fabulous 4 is an upcoming American comedy film directed by Jocelyn Morehouse
[40:26.290 --> 40:28.230]  and written by Anne-Marie Allison.
[40:28.890 --> 40:30.110]  Stars Susan Sarandon,
[40:30.470 --> 40:31.370]  Bette Midler,
[40:31.970 --> 40:32.790]  Megan Mullally,
[40:33.230 --> 40:34.770]  and Cheryl Lee Ralph.
[40:37.930 --> 40:38.290]  Two.
[40:40.030 --> 40:40.950]  Jeff leading with two.
[40:42.170 --> 40:43.350]  Anyone else want to get in on it?
[40:45.470 --> 40:45.830]  Uh...
[40:45.830 --> 40:46.510]  Boy.
[40:47.410 --> 40:47.730]  No.
[40:47.870 --> 40:48.350]  Two going once.
[40:49.110 --> 40:49.470]  I'll take it.
[40:49.470 --> 40:49.950]  Two going twice.
[40:49.990 --> 40:50.430]  Two going to move two.
[40:50.870 --> 40:52.670]  It could be the next First Wife Club.
[40:52.730 --> 40:52.970]  Could be.
[40:53.010 --> 40:54.110]  Could be the next Banger Sisters.
[40:55.230 --> 40:56.370]  I feel like you could have got that for one.
[40:56.930 --> 40:58.830]  Why did you add a one there and then a two?
[41:00.310 --> 41:01.070]  To fuck you?
[41:01.430 --> 41:01.950]  Is it working?
[41:02.030 --> 41:02.250]  What?
[41:02.730 --> 41:02.910]  What?
[41:02.910 --> 41:03.890]  I didn't already have a one.
[41:03.990 --> 41:04.910]  I didn't have a one for...
[41:04.910 --> 41:05.190]  Did I?
[41:05.190 --> 41:06.970]  Oh, that's my New Line horror movie.
[41:07.050 --> 41:07.550]  Sorry, sorry.
[41:07.610 --> 41:08.650]  Oh, why are you yelling at me?
[41:08.650 --> 41:09.690]  Jesus Christ.
[41:10.090 --> 41:10.590]  Why are you yelling at me?
[41:11.190 --> 41:11.850]  Keep hitting the test.
[41:12.050 --> 41:12.710]  Trying to...
[41:12.710 --> 41:14.770]  Harold and the purple crayon.
[41:14.970 --> 41:15.110]  One!
[41:19.490 --> 41:20.450]  Eric with one.
[41:21.010 --> 41:21.390]  One!
[41:21.930 --> 41:23.630]  No one else that did this purple crayon?
[41:24.710 --> 41:26.030]  I don't know what the fuck it is.
[41:26.250 --> 41:26.510]  Can we see the picture?
[41:26.510 --> 41:27.170]  Are you serious?
[41:28.130 --> 41:31.450]  It's a famous kids book that is being turned into a movie.
[41:32.230 --> 41:32.590]  Never.
[41:32.890 --> 41:34.190]  I never read it to my kid.
[41:34.570 --> 41:34.910]  I don't know.
[41:36.010 --> 41:36.890]  Harold and the two.
[41:37.450 --> 41:38.430]  Trying to see if it'll...
[41:38.430 --> 41:38.670]  What?
[41:39.090 --> 41:39.910]  Come on.
[41:40.930 --> 41:41.070]  Two.
[41:41.070 --> 41:42.170]  I just want to give you a poster for it.
[41:42.810 --> 41:43.430]  Geoff with two.
[41:43.450 --> 41:43.690]  No, it doesn't.
[41:47.230 --> 41:48.070]  Alright, hang on.
[41:48.150 --> 41:50.610]  Andrew, don't start moving on it yet.
[41:50.710 --> 41:51.750]  I have to think this through.
[41:52.550 --> 41:56.650]  Are enough people going to go,
[41:57.090 --> 42:04.470]  why the fuck did they make this to be worth three points?
[42:05.670 --> 42:09.170]  It is so bizarre.
[42:10.590 --> 42:12.750]  Why did they do this?
[42:14.110 --> 42:15.690]  Starz Zachary Levi.
[42:16.470 --> 42:16.590]  Yeah.
[42:16.630 --> 42:17.890]  Oh, oh, yes, it does.
[42:18.050 --> 42:18.530]  Alfred Molina.
[42:18.890 --> 42:19.570]  Zoey Deschanel.
[42:20.050 --> 42:20.390]  Yeah.
[42:20.630 --> 42:20.750]  Janine Clement.
[42:22.710 --> 42:25.370]  It is three.
[42:27.410 --> 42:29.050]  I think it's so bizarre.
[42:29.230 --> 42:29.730]  I had to go.
[42:29.730 --> 42:30.550]  I have to go three.
[42:32.270 --> 42:33.850]  Three going twice.
[42:36.150 --> 42:37.910]  Man, I got a dick all movies.
[42:38.290 --> 42:40.390]  To Eric with three.
[42:43.990 --> 42:49.270]  Next film, another movie that we pitched something for that will not happen.
[42:49.990 --> 42:51.630]  Borderlands, the movie.
[42:55.430 --> 42:56.330]  Like from the game?
[42:56.930 --> 42:57.170]  Yes.
[42:57.410 --> 42:57.690]  Yeah.
[42:57.830 --> 42:58.170]  Yes.
[42:58.870 --> 43:00.250]  Directed by Eli Roth.
[43:00.810 --> 43:01.910]  Starring Kevin Hart.
[43:02.510 --> 43:03.390]  Jamie Lee Curtis.
[43:05.010 --> 43:06.130]  Cate Blanchett.
[43:06.350 --> 43:06.910]  Cate Blanchett.
[43:07.010 --> 43:07.310]  That's right.
[43:07.370 --> 43:07.690]  Yeah, yeah.
[43:08.070 --> 43:09.110]  It's her birthday today.
[43:09.510 --> 43:10.330]  Jeff, you're going for?
[43:10.770 --> 43:12.170]  Yeah, I'll go for Bobby Lee's.
[43:12.330 --> 43:13.270]  I'll do five.
[43:13.410 --> 43:13.590]  Yep.
[43:14.630 --> 43:15.370]  Eric with five.
[43:16.470 --> 43:16.790]  Six.
[43:18.070 --> 43:19.050]  Jeff with six.
[43:20.610 --> 43:21.390]  Eric with eight.
[43:22.270 --> 43:23.290]  I'll go ten.
[43:24.570 --> 43:27.090]  Oh, you had 11 in you, Eric.
[43:27.550 --> 43:28.790]  Let me look at the rest of this list.
[43:29.290 --> 43:31.850]  I was going to say you guys are going to have to start spending money on something.
[43:31.950 --> 43:33.290]  You do not take your points with you.
[43:34.670 --> 43:36.590]  Can I just add it to my box office total?
[43:38.350 --> 43:38.870]  What?
[43:39.610 --> 43:41.530]  You want to add 41 to your pot?
[43:41.850 --> 43:45.310]  Yeah, it'll be like $33 million in $41.
[43:46.130 --> 43:46.310]  Yeah.
[43:47.250 --> 43:48.970]  Um, yeah, you know what?
[43:49.030 --> 43:53.330]  I think if you have any points left over, you can add them to your box office total.
[43:55.090 --> 43:56.790]  I'm gonna... Jeff, you're at 10?
[43:57.630 --> 43:58.030]  Yeah.
[44:00.070 --> 44:00.990]  I'll do 11.
[44:01.770 --> 44:02.670]  Eric with 11.
[44:04.150 --> 44:05.150]  Is that enough?
[44:06.030 --> 44:07.110]  11 going once.
[44:07.990 --> 44:08.990]  11 going twice.
[44:10.110 --> 44:11.350]  Sold to Eric at 11.
[44:14.090 --> 44:17.390]  I don't feel good about that, but I feel good enough about it.
[44:17.650 --> 44:17.950]  You know what I mean?
[44:18.050 --> 44:18.990]  You have seven movies.
[44:19.570 --> 44:19.790]  Yeah.
[44:20.870 --> 44:21.710]  Racking it up.
[44:22.090 --> 44:23.570]  What is It Ends With Us?
[44:24.570 --> 44:25.950]  It Ends With Us.
[44:26.130 --> 44:27.230]  I feel like I've read that.
[44:27.270 --> 44:27.750]  Is it a book?
[44:28.570 --> 44:29.350]  What is It Ends With Us?
[44:29.350 --> 44:30.310]  It does sound familiar.
[44:31.310 --> 44:32.630]  It Ends With Us is a book.
[44:32.630 --> 44:43.210]  And it is also a movie starring Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni, Brandon Sklolnar, uh, Jenny Slate.
[44:43.670 --> 44:43.990]  Interesting.
[44:44.470 --> 44:45.810]  Oh, Jeff loves Jenny Slate.
[44:46.330 --> 44:47.130]  Yeah, Jenny Slate's great.
[44:48.110 --> 44:50.210]  You have one dream about a lady.
[44:52.130 --> 44:57.730]  Complications arise when a woman's high school love interest comes back into her life.
[45:01.380 --> 45:02.520]  Blake Lively.
[45:03.080 --> 45:03.480]  One.
[45:03.560 --> 45:04.380]  Jeff with one.
[45:06.680 --> 45:07.580]  One going one.
[45:07.900 --> 45:08.200]  Two.
[45:09.100 --> 45:09.500]  Three.
[45:12.060 --> 45:13.420]  Gavin, you gotta get in here, man.
[45:14.240 --> 45:14.460]  Nah.
[45:15.360 --> 45:16.520]  Three going twice.
[45:17.980 --> 45:19.680]  Sold to Jeff at three.
[45:20.280 --> 45:21.260]  Now, here's the thing.
[45:21.400 --> 45:23.560]  That might be a good one for, uh...
[45:23.560 --> 45:24.120]  Could be huge.
[45:24.800 --> 45:24.920]  Yeah.
[45:25.020 --> 45:27.640]  I mean, I don't think it's gonna be gigantic, but I do think that...
[45:27.640 --> 45:28.440]  No, but like...
[45:28.440 --> 45:31.160]  Based on book type situation...
[45:31.160 --> 45:33.580]  It's probably a $150 million movie, hopefully.
[45:35.120 --> 45:36.400]  That's like a summer reader.
[45:36.860 --> 45:38.280]  Next up, Cuckoo.
[45:39.100 --> 45:40.460]  I believe it's another horror film.
[45:41.300 --> 45:46.960]  17-year-old Gretchen reluctantly leaves America to live with her father at a resort in the German
[45:46.960 --> 45:47.320]  Alps.
[45:47.700 --> 45:53.000]  Plagued by strange noises and bloody visions, she soon discovers a shocking secret that concerns
[45:53.000 --> 45:54.300]  her own family.
[45:54.820 --> 45:55.800]  Oh, my God.
[45:57.140 --> 45:58.360]  I like the way Andrew said it.
[45:59.240 --> 45:59.820]  Anyone wanna bid?
[46:00.300 --> 46:00.640]  One.
[46:02.940 --> 46:03.880]  Jeff with one.
[46:04.720 --> 46:06.360]  I think I might let him have it.
[46:07.340 --> 46:08.800]  Jeff with one going once.
[46:09.320 --> 46:09.760]  Two.
[46:10.920 --> 46:11.360]  Wow.
[46:12.460 --> 46:14.140]  Gavin with two going once.
[46:16.060 --> 46:16.500]  Twice.
[46:16.860 --> 46:18.200]  I just want some bargains, you know?
[46:18.260 --> 46:18.480]  Three.
[46:18.640 --> 46:18.860]  Did you hear that?
[46:19.080 --> 46:19.860]  Oh, my God.
[46:20.020 --> 46:20.820]  It's not a bargain anymore.
[46:20.920 --> 46:21.440]  Jeff's even in with three.
[46:22.020 --> 46:24.780]  I think four is still a bargain for Cuckoo.
[46:24.800 --> 46:25.220]  Yeah, I would...
[46:26.760 --> 46:28.280]  Oh, Cuckoo, as Andrew says.
[46:31.300 --> 46:32.220]  Going twice.
[46:33.420 --> 46:33.900]  Cuckoo.
[46:35.500 --> 46:35.980]  Sold.
[46:37.380 --> 46:41.460]  I think that's gonna be like a midsomer type thing.
[46:43.060 --> 46:44.740]  Yeah, I doubt it, but yeah, maybe.
[46:45.080 --> 46:45.580]  Never know.
[46:46.180 --> 46:46.400]  Yep.
[46:47.480 --> 46:48.360]  Will or won't.
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.100]  Next film, The Fire Inside doesn't have a box office mojo page or else we'd have one.
[46:55.820 --> 46:57.840]  I don't really know what this is, to be completely honest.
[46:57.960 --> 46:58.320]  Let me pull it up.
[46:58.340 --> 46:59.620]  The story of Clarissa...
[46:59.620 --> 47:00.400]  Clarissa?
[47:00.400 --> 47:01.620]  No, Clarissa.
[47:01.940 --> 47:06.740]  The story of Clarissa T-Rex Shields, a boxer from Flint, Michigan,
[47:07.160 --> 47:12.680]  who trained to become the first woman in her country's history to win an Olympic gold medal
[47:12.680 --> 47:13.800]  in the sport.
[47:14.220 --> 47:17.140]  I saw a trailer for this movie and it looked good.
[47:17.280 --> 47:18.240]  I will bet one for it.
[47:18.800 --> 47:19.580]  I already said one.
[47:20.000 --> 47:20.440]  Oh, two.
[47:21.780 --> 47:22.480]  Jeff with a two.
[47:23.880 --> 47:24.640]  Bought once.
[47:24.800 --> 47:25.440]  Where am I at?
[47:26.520 --> 47:27.520]  Bought twice.
[47:28.920 --> 47:29.620]  Sold to Jeff.
[47:29.620 --> 47:30.780]  At two.
[47:31.200 --> 47:31.540]  Yeehaw.
[47:33.120 --> 47:34.420]  I think I played this wrong.
[47:34.920 --> 47:35.260]  Oh.
[47:35.520 --> 47:36.700]  I played this super wrong.
[47:41.320 --> 47:41.880]  Trap.
[47:42.760 --> 47:44.920]  M. Night Shyamalan movie.
[47:45.540 --> 47:45.740]  One.
[47:46.000 --> 47:46.620]  Josh Hartnett.
[47:47.840 --> 47:48.220]  One.
[47:48.360 --> 47:48.580]  One.
[47:49.160 --> 47:49.940]  I'll say three.
[47:51.620 --> 47:52.460]  Oh, Eric with three.
[47:53.780 --> 47:54.900]  Three going one.
[47:56.720 --> 47:57.100]  That's a good deal.
[47:57.100 --> 47:57.800]  Three going twice.
[47:59.620 --> 48:01.000]  Sold to Eric at three.
[48:01.100 --> 48:02.220]  I think that's a hell of a buy.
[48:02.220 --> 48:04.700]  That is going to be a sleeper hit.
[48:05.020 --> 48:06.820]  I think it's going to have momentum.
[48:07.400 --> 48:10.860]  The trailer looked, I thought, really good.
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.600]  I was very impressed and I don't like his movies almost at all.
[48:15.980 --> 48:17.540]  I thought this trailer looked really interesting.
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.560]  Did you see that movie, The Visit, he did?
[48:20.540 --> 48:20.980]  No.
[48:21.380 --> 48:23.740]  That is a fucking awesome movie.
[48:23.780 --> 48:24.560]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[48:24.660 --> 48:26.100]  When he has no budget...
[48:26.100 --> 48:28.560]  I have this theory about this guy where he has no budget
[48:28.560 --> 48:31.520]  and he makes movies scrappy with people that don't know how to make movies,
[48:31.880 --> 48:32.860]  like where they're like learning.
[48:33.120 --> 48:34.680]  He fucking knocks it out of the park.
[48:34.960 --> 48:37.760]  But he keeps getting in this cycle where he does that
[48:37.760 --> 48:40.260]  and then he gets too big and makes too much money.
[48:40.400 --> 48:41.280]  He flies too close to the sun.
[48:41.340 --> 48:45.020]  He makes dog shit and then he has to start all over from square one.
[48:45.360 --> 48:47.520]  You give him too much money and he doesn't know what to do with it.
[48:47.660 --> 48:48.200]  Yep, yep.
[48:48.340 --> 48:49.300]  And so he makes banger movies.
[48:49.420 --> 48:52.420]  And I think this, this is going to be his sweet spot.
[48:52.580 --> 48:53.520]  I feel good about this one.
[48:53.920 --> 48:54.380]  All right.
[48:56.240 --> 48:56.960]  Alien Romulus.
[48:57.220 --> 48:57.580]  One.
[48:58.700 --> 49:01.800]  Unbelievably, they are making another alien movie.
[49:02.060 --> 49:03.880]  Is this Ridley Scott or someone else?
[49:03.880 --> 49:04.260]  No.
[49:04.480 --> 49:04.860]  No.
[49:05.240 --> 49:07.380]  He's just walked away from his new trilogy, has he?
[49:07.660 --> 49:08.060]  Yeah.
[49:08.400 --> 49:09.280]  Yeah, I believe so.
[49:09.660 --> 49:13.360]  It's a new entry in the alien franchise that still doesn't explain.
[49:13.520 --> 49:16.960]  I feel like the movie, the space jockey thing that they've tried to explain
[49:16.960 --> 49:19.040]  for like the last six movies.
[49:19.940 --> 49:21.620]  This is the seventh installment.
[49:22.020 --> 49:22.320]  Aliens.
[49:23.300 --> 49:23.460]  Yeah.
[49:23.720 --> 49:24.460]  Seventh installment.
[49:25.160 --> 49:25.740]  Gavin said one.
[49:25.800 --> 49:26.120]  I'll say two.
[49:27.960 --> 49:29.060]  Two going one.
[49:29.940 --> 49:30.540]  Three.
[49:32.040 --> 49:33.160]  Three going one.
[49:35.480 --> 49:36.080]  Four.
[49:37.620 --> 49:38.720]  Four going one.
[49:39.280 --> 49:39.980]  Five going one.
[49:40.480 --> 49:41.420]  Oh shit, now we're going.
[49:41.780 --> 49:42.860]  Six going one.
[49:43.240 --> 49:43.740]  Popping off.
[49:45.560 --> 49:46.580]  Six going twice.
[49:47.520 --> 49:48.420]  Seven going one.
[49:48.820 --> 49:49.560]  Eight going once.
[49:50.540 --> 49:50.980]  Eleven.
[49:53.040 --> 49:54.320]  Eleven going once.
[49:55.840 --> 49:57.000]  Hang on, hang on.
[49:57.580 --> 49:59.040]  Let me look at this list.
[49:59.700 --> 50:00.640]  Eleven going twice.
[50:02.220 --> 50:02.720]  Twelve.
[50:04.800 --> 50:05.820]  Twelve going one.
[50:07.560 --> 50:08.060]  Thirteen.
[50:09.920 --> 50:10.820]  You know what?
[50:11.460 --> 50:11.960]  You know what?
[50:12.040 --> 50:12.440]  All yours.
[50:13.660 --> 50:14.640]  Sold to Gavin.
[50:14.740 --> 50:16.580]  Unless Jeff, do you want to step in?
[50:16.780 --> 50:22.100]  Sold to Gavin at thirteen.
[50:23.760 --> 50:26.160]  It's tough because I want to say it will make money.
[50:26.160 --> 50:27.940]  I don't have confidence that it will make money.
[50:28.200 --> 50:29.120]  Yeah, I hope it's good.
[50:29.580 --> 50:32.360]  I mean, Alien at the front carries some weight.
[50:32.500 --> 50:35.240]  It probably carries a hundred million dollars worth of weight.
[50:35.760 --> 50:39.400]  I think that Alien at the front carries about seven points worth of weight.
[50:39.700 --> 50:42.500]  But when you get up to about thirteen, I don't know that it carries thirteen points.
[50:42.600 --> 50:43.720]  But we are pretty far down the list.
[50:43.760 --> 50:44.080]  So we'll see.
[50:44.220 --> 50:45.120]  We are. We're almost done.
[50:45.620 --> 50:45.760]  Yep.
[50:46.360 --> 50:48.660]  Horizon and American Saga chapter two.
[50:48.880 --> 50:50.900]  The continuation of Kevin Costner's film.
[50:51.440 --> 50:52.860]  It's also coming out in the summer.
[50:53.640 --> 50:54.380]  It is, yeah.
[50:54.660 --> 50:56.080]  Yeah, I think it comes out in like August.
[50:56.080 --> 50:58.480]  It is. It is mid-August release.
[50:58.820 --> 50:59.040]  Yeah.
[51:00.120 --> 51:01.660]  Is Jeff going to get it?
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.060]  I'll take a... I'll bid one on it.
[51:04.360 --> 51:04.700]  Two.
[51:05.720 --> 51:06.400]  Three.
[51:08.260 --> 51:09.360]  Three going one.
[51:09.880 --> 51:10.460]  Four.
[51:11.020 --> 51:11.680]  Five.
[51:13.560 --> 51:14.720]  Five going one.
[51:16.580 --> 51:17.960]  Five going twice.
[51:18.280 --> 51:18.860]  Six.
[51:22.310 --> 51:23.670]  Six going once.
[51:25.350 --> 51:26.770]  Six going twice.
[51:29.310 --> 51:30.810]  It's sold to Gavin at six.
[51:30.910 --> 51:34.310]  Jeff, did you pay twenty points on the first one?
[51:34.310 --> 51:36.250]  I've already invested my money in that movie.
[51:36.370 --> 51:38.850]  Well, I was gonna say, here's the thing.
[51:39.390 --> 51:40.890]  Part one might make some money.
[51:41.130 --> 51:44.290]  I will say no fucking shot part two makes anything.
[51:44.450 --> 51:46.130]  What if part two is like the two towers?
[51:46.610 --> 51:47.970]  Yeah, it could be huge.
[51:48.410 --> 51:48.570]  What?
[51:48.870 --> 51:50.610]  Oh, the movie.
[51:50.870 --> 51:52.050]  Or not 9-11.
[51:52.370 --> 51:52.990]  Boy, I was...
[51:53.610 --> 51:54.570]  Oh, man.
[51:54.650 --> 51:56.610]  What are you talking about, bud?
[51:56.970 --> 51:57.870]  You went to a dark spot.
[51:57.870 --> 51:59.290]  Jesus Christ.
[51:59.570 --> 52:00.010]  Goddamn.
[52:00.190 --> 52:00.830]  I didn't understand.
[52:01.290 --> 52:02.730]  That's my cheapest purchase.
[52:03.290 --> 52:06.410]  You know, what is Ryan's World, the movie?
[52:06.870 --> 52:07.190]  I don't know.
[52:07.450 --> 52:09.050]  Ryan is a YouTube kid.
[52:09.230 --> 52:10.850]  I think that this toy stuff.
[52:10.970 --> 52:11.370]  Oh, yeah.
[52:11.450 --> 52:13.210]  And this is his movie.
[52:13.750 --> 52:14.670]  One, two.
[52:16.350 --> 52:18.650]  Jeff Ryan toys review guy.
[52:18.930 --> 52:19.090]  Yeah.
[52:19.210 --> 52:23.130]  Ryan's toy review guy has a movie called Ryan's World, the movie.
[52:23.370 --> 52:24.270]  Jeff, we met him.
[52:25.110 --> 52:25.610]  Did we?
[52:25.610 --> 52:29.590]  Well, we didn't meet Ryan, but we met the guy that runs the channel.
[52:30.290 --> 52:30.790]  Did we?
[52:30.910 --> 52:31.730]  When did we do that?
[52:33.270 --> 52:33.850]  Did we really?
[52:34.130 --> 52:34.710]  Yeah, in New York.
[52:35.570 --> 52:36.190]  Oh, OK.
[52:36.990 --> 52:38.070]  Did we like him?
[52:39.390 --> 52:40.250]  I mean, I liked him.
[52:40.330 --> 52:41.010]  He's very...
[52:41.010 --> 52:41.610]  Why are we...
[52:41.610 --> 52:42.590]  Well, we have to...
[52:42.590 --> 52:43.770]  You brought this up.
[52:43.850 --> 52:44.310]  I don't know.
[52:44.730 --> 52:46.490]  I don't want to derail the middle of the auction.
[52:46.730 --> 52:47.230]  No, it's fine.
[52:47.530 --> 52:47.830]  Two.
[52:48.270 --> 52:49.070]  Jeff with two.
[52:49.390 --> 52:49.750]  Three.
[52:50.890 --> 52:51.930]  Gavin with three.
[52:52.270 --> 52:52.550]  Four.
[52:52.950 --> 52:53.190]  Wow.
[52:53.410 --> 52:55.290]  Apparently, I'm close friends with the guy who made it.
[52:56.150 --> 52:56.710]  Six.
[52:58.290 --> 53:03.330]  Jeff believes in this more than he believes in Horizon and American Sega Chapter 2.
[53:03.750 --> 53:04.770]  Jeff with six.
[53:07.290 --> 53:08.130]  Jeff with six.
[53:08.150 --> 53:08.690]  Going once.
[53:09.890 --> 53:10.450]  Twice.
[53:11.730 --> 53:12.290]  Sold.
[53:13.030 --> 53:17.390]  I cannot believe that Ryan's World, the movie, went for six points.
[53:18.050 --> 53:19.550]  I think it should have gone higher or lower.
[53:20.210 --> 53:21.590]  A much lower, in my opinion.
[53:21.750 --> 53:24.530]  That was the number one YouTube channel in the world.
[53:24.810 --> 53:25.190]  It's going to make money.
[53:25.190 --> 53:26.010]  Five years.
[53:26.410 --> 53:26.970]  It's going to make money.
[53:27.070 --> 53:27.110]  Yeah.
[53:27.130 --> 53:30.450]  But once again, when the iron was hot, how did Rooster Teeth do?
[53:33.310 --> 53:36.370]  Rooster Teeth was never the number one anything in the world ever.
[53:39.090 --> 53:40.850]  Next film is Blink Twice.
[53:41.790 --> 53:44.070]  This is a Channing Tatum horror film.
[53:44.730 --> 53:49.450]  When tech billionaire Slater King meets Frida, he invites her to join him and his friends
[53:49.450 --> 53:52.030]  for a dream vacation on his private island.
[53:52.030 --> 53:58.730]  However, as strange things start to happen, she'll have to uncover the truth if she wants
[53:58.730 --> 54:00.110]  to make it out alive.
[54:00.350 --> 54:02.790]  Director Zoe Kravitz.
[54:03.150 --> 54:04.590]  Oh, yeah.
[54:05.310 --> 54:10.430]  My favorite thing in the world to do is to, whenever there's a capital L and an I together,
[54:10.830 --> 54:11.710]  pronounce it as a U.
[54:12.090 --> 54:13.870]  So I'm going to put one on bunk twice.
[54:15.750 --> 54:17.970]  I'll bid two on bunk twice.
[54:19.350 --> 54:19.910]  Three.
[54:20.670 --> 54:21.270]  Four.
[54:21.530 --> 54:21.890]  Love is bund.
[54:22.970 --> 54:23.990]  Jeff with four.
[54:26.610 --> 54:28.210]  Jeff with four going once.
[54:29.370 --> 54:31.450]  Jeff with four going twice.
[54:32.990 --> 54:34.170]  Sold to Jeff.
[54:34.630 --> 54:36.850]  Yeah, island movies are hot right now.
[54:37.590 --> 54:39.830]  What are you talking about?
[54:40.330 --> 54:42.770]  Triangle of Sadness, island movie.
[54:43.170 --> 54:46.930]  That movie where they all go and they eat at the restaurant and then they get stuck
[54:46.930 --> 54:48.330]  there, restaurant movie.
[54:48.330 --> 54:52.850]  The other one, the glass onion, island movie.
[54:53.450 --> 54:54.650]  Island, island, island.
[54:54.770 --> 54:56.790]  Every year there's a hot island movie right now.
[54:57.210 --> 55:02.990]  Could have gone with rich people being killed off as the common denominator there, but went
[55:02.990 --> 55:04.470]  with on an island.
[55:05.110 --> 55:06.590]  Yeah, all the people were on an island.
[55:07.590 --> 55:08.750]  It pens them in, doesn't it?
[55:09.550 --> 55:09.850]  Yeah.
[55:10.230 --> 55:10.790]  It does.
[55:12.310 --> 55:12.990]  Nature's pen.
[55:13.250 --> 55:18.310]  Just as we're getting to the bottom, points wise, I have 48, Gavin has 40, Jeff has 22.
[55:18.930 --> 55:23.110]  No, I have been out of this draft for what feels like a day.
[55:23.430 --> 55:23.570]  Yeah.
[55:24.430 --> 55:29.410]  Next film, speaking about film striking when the iron is hot, The Crow.
[55:29.810 --> 55:30.490]  The Crow.
[55:31.050 --> 55:31.390]  One.
[55:32.790 --> 55:33.330]  Three.
[55:33.810 --> 55:36.310]  Is this a remake or a sequel or what?
[55:37.030 --> 55:39.170]  I think it's a remake with Bill Skarsgård.
[55:39.690 --> 55:39.970]  Yeah.
[55:40.790 --> 55:42.870]  I bet the armor is going to be extra careful on that.
[55:44.050 --> 55:44.970]  You'd hope so.
[55:45.290 --> 55:46.550]  Yeah, one would assume.
[55:48.030 --> 55:49.910]  So, sorry, who is top bid with three?
[55:50.010 --> 55:50.990]  Me, three, three.
[55:51.090 --> 55:51.970]  Eric with three.
[55:52.330 --> 55:52.630]  Four.
[55:53.570 --> 55:53.930]  Five.
[55:54.070 --> 55:54.610]  Gavin with four.
[55:54.810 --> 55:55.170]  Five.
[55:56.550 --> 55:56.950]  Six?
[55:57.950 --> 55:59.790]  We got a Ryan's World the movie on our hands.
[55:59.890 --> 56:01.250]  Oh, even better than Ryan's World.
[56:01.370 --> 56:02.030]  Eric with seven.
[56:04.270 --> 56:04.670]  Eight.
[56:04.690 --> 56:05.230]  Seven going one.
[56:05.770 --> 56:06.090]  Nine.
[56:06.270 --> 56:06.530]  Eight.
[56:07.210 --> 56:07.590]  Nine.
[56:07.970 --> 56:08.590]  Nine going one.
[56:08.950 --> 56:11.490]  It's not worth this, but I don't know what else to spend on.
[56:12.190 --> 56:13.610]  That's the problem when you weigh in.
[56:14.810 --> 56:15.190]  Eleven.
[56:15.310 --> 56:15.650]  Ten going one.
[56:15.930 --> 56:16.330]  Eleven.
[56:16.530 --> 56:17.170]  Twelve.
[56:17.890 --> 56:18.430]  Thirteen.
[56:19.970 --> 56:20.530]  Fourteen.
[56:20.750 --> 56:21.190]  Fifteen.
[56:21.910 --> 56:22.870]  Twenty-two.
[56:23.390 --> 56:23.870]  Twenty-three.
[56:24.830 --> 56:25.350]  All right.
[56:26.210 --> 56:27.450]  Gavin is now out.
[56:27.870 --> 56:29.390]  Eric with twenty-three going once.
[56:30.150 --> 56:31.210]  Going twice.
[56:31.910 --> 56:33.970]  Sold to Eric for twenty-three points.
[56:34.230 --> 56:37.230]  Of this whole list, Eric spent the most on the crow.
[56:38.330 --> 56:42.250]  I think that, I think, I don't think it's going to kill.
[56:42.570 --> 56:45.750]  I think there will be an audience for the crow.
[56:46.310 --> 56:50.430]  As weird as that sounds, the amount of time between the last one and this one,
[56:50.770 --> 56:57.190]  the weird goth resurgence thing, and like, to me, everything, it's prime to do well.
[56:57.510 --> 57:01.510]  I think, I think that this movie has enough time between the last, all this stuff.
[57:01.810 --> 57:03.630]  It has the clown guy from it.
[57:03.970 --> 57:06.710]  It's going to be a weird Tumblr movie that does well.
[57:06.830 --> 57:07.790]  That's how it feels to me.
[57:07.810 --> 57:08.710]  I think you might be right.
[57:10.410 --> 57:15.910]  Like, Gen Z is intrigued enough in the 90s already.
[57:16.210 --> 57:18.190]  I think that this might scratch an itch.
[57:18.610 --> 57:21.250]  I think that it will, the budget was only fifty million.
[57:21.490 --> 57:24.850]  I think it's going to crush in the box office just because,
[57:25.430 --> 57:27.990]  oh wow, this was pretty good, and that's all it needs to be.
[57:28.110 --> 57:30.910]  It already has name recognition, but people don't know why.
[57:31.130 --> 57:32.070]  You know, they just know the name.
[57:32.390 --> 57:32.550]  Yeah.
[57:32.890 --> 57:37.090]  Well, the next film does not have name recognition.
[57:37.090 --> 57:39.770]  It is another biblical movie, I believe.
[57:40.390 --> 57:41.270]  The Forge.
[57:42.130 --> 57:42.470]  One.
[57:44.510 --> 57:45.990]  One going once.
[57:47.270 --> 57:48.730]  One going twice.
[57:49.170 --> 57:50.750]  Hang on, hang on before you get there.
[57:51.070 --> 57:55.070]  Jeff, after graduating from high school without any plans for the future,
[57:55.390 --> 58:00.090]  Isaiah receives a push to start making better life decisions.
[58:01.070 --> 58:01.470]  Does that...
[58:03.490 --> 58:04.730]  do anything for you?
[58:06.010 --> 58:06.690]  No.
[58:07.090 --> 58:09.530]  Sold to Gavin at one.
[58:09.790 --> 58:10.310]  Bargain.
[58:11.750 --> 58:13.250]  Now you're left with 21.
[58:13.790 --> 58:14.310]  Great number.
[58:15.190 --> 58:21.050]  Going into Slingshot does not have a box office mojo page.
[58:21.930 --> 58:23.490]  Slingshot 2024.
[58:25.110 --> 58:30.430]  An astronaut struggles to maintain his grip on reality aboard a possibly fatal,
[58:30.690 --> 58:34.850]  a possibly fatally compromised mission to Saturn's moon, Titan.
[58:34.850 --> 58:35.330]  Hmm.
[58:37.270 --> 58:40.870]  Lawrence Fishburne, Casey Affleck, David Morrissey.
[58:41.290 --> 58:41.550]  Wow.
[58:42.290 --> 58:42.810]  Oh.
[58:43.890 --> 58:44.410]  One.
[58:45.450 --> 58:46.370]  I already said one.
[58:46.510 --> 58:47.070]  Gavin said one.
[58:47.310 --> 58:47.390]  Two.
[58:48.910 --> 58:49.430]  Three.
[58:49.650 --> 58:50.510]  Gavin does like space shit.
[58:52.270 --> 58:52.830]  Three going once.
[58:53.030 --> 58:54.670]  Lawrence Fishburne in space is usually pretty gnarly, isn't he?
[58:54.670 --> 58:55.650]  Yeah, he does pretty well.
[58:57.050 --> 58:57.830]  Three going twice.
[58:59.310 --> 59:00.150]  Who's on three?
[59:00.890 --> 59:01.410]  You.
[59:01.870 --> 59:02.150]  Hey!
[59:02.410 --> 59:04.370]  Sold to you at three.
[59:05.730 --> 59:06.290]  Fair.
[59:11.500 --> 59:15.260]  Once again, no box office mojo page for City of Dreams.
[59:16.260 --> 59:16.300]  One.
[59:17.460 --> 59:19.640]  Gavin with one, just blindly throwing one at it.
[59:19.720 --> 59:20.060]  Why not?
[59:20.220 --> 59:21.160]  Hang on, hang on.
[59:21.320 --> 59:22.260]  City of Dreams.
[59:23.920 --> 59:29.940]  Inspired by a true story, City of Dreams chronicles the journey of a Mexican boy
[59:29.940 --> 59:35.640]  whose dreams of becoming a soccer star are shattered when he's smuggled across the border
[59:35.640 --> 59:39.500]  and sold to a sweatshop in downtown Los Angeles.
[59:40.820 --> 59:41.780]  Sam Levine!
[59:43.680 --> 59:44.400]  Sam Levine?
[59:44.600 --> 59:45.040]  Sam Levine?
[59:45.260 --> 59:46.240]  Yep, I'll go two.
[59:47.020 --> 59:47.960]  We had him on, uh...
[59:48.580 --> 59:48.920]  Yes.
[59:49.260 --> 59:49.460]  Yeah.
[59:50.380 --> 59:50.840]  I'll say two.
[59:51.040 --> 59:51.840]  With two going one.
[59:52.180 --> 59:55.420]  Sam Levine, that's the guy behind Ryan Toy Reviews, right?
[59:57.920 --> 59:59.000]  Yeah, he's the channel manager.
[59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.140]  Three going one for Gavin.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.160]  Going twice.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.960]  You got it, buddy.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.800]  Sold to Gavin.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.000]  Gavin on a run of films.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.600]  I'm getting the dregs, boys.
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.660]  Put a lot of faith in Steve Carell.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.340]  Next film is...
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:17.500]  Yes, you did.
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:19.820]  Reagan!
[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:21.520]  Look at that fucking picture!
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:23.960]  Five!
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.440]  Film about Reagan.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.220]  Eric with five going once.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:29.420]  Six.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.440]  Six going one.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.100]  Uh...
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.400]  Eight.
[01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:39.770]  Eight going once.
[01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:41.570]  Fifteen.
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.790]  Nine.
[01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.150]  What? Fifteen? Okay!
[01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:44.170]  Fifteen.
[01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.050]  What the fuck?
[01:00:47.170 --> 01:00:50.310]  Gavin doesn't want to take any dollars with him into the box office.
[01:00:51.790 --> 01:00:53.330]  Gavin, fifteen going once.
[01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.890]  I should have said fourteen.
[01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:56.150]  Twice.
[01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:58.190]  Sixteen.
[01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.630]  Oh!
[01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.070]  Eric swooping in with a sixteen!
[01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.350]  Geoff, do you want to count her or are you happy giving it to Eric?
[01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:06.010]  I do not!
[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:09.730]  Eric gets it with sixteen points.
[01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:16.610]  If you knew at the beginning of this list that you'd be chucking sixteen on Reagan.
[01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:17.470]  And Reagan!
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.390]  What is they listen?
[01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.310]  They listen.
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.710]  Oh, hang on, this is a different one.
[01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:23.830]  Hang on, what the fuck?
[01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:25.690]  What is they listen 2024?
[01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:27.050]  Hang on, there we go.
[01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:28.690]  They listen.
[01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:31.530]  How is that?
[01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:34.770]  When you search for it, plot under wraps.
[01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.910]  Twenty.
[01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:42.710]  They listen is an upcoming Blumhouse horror movie written and directed by Chris Weitz.
[01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:45.010]  Geoff with twenty.
[01:01:45.490 --> 01:01:46.130]  I'll bid twenty.
[01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:47.890]  Geoff's buying up the last two.
[01:01:47.890 --> 01:01:49.210]  Nobody can bid beyond that.
[01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:52.090]  Geoff didn't even need to bid that high, but Geoff is getting it for twenty.
[01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:52.730]  Doesn't matter.
[01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:53.830]  Yep.
[01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:56.210]  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
[01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:56.470]  No!
[01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:57.210]  What's that about?
[01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:00.630]  What if Eric and I combine our chips?
[01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.710]  Oh, and we take, we can do it!
[01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:03.490]  We can beat him out!
[01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:06.250]  That is not allowed.
[01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:07.030]  What?
[01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:07.410]  Why?
[01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.870]  I'm gonna bid, I'm gonna bid, I'm gonna bid sixteen.
[01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:13.410]  What happened over here?
[01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.970]  There you go.
[01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:14.470]  Thank you.
[01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:15.810]  Okay, you're bidding what?
[01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:16.350]  Geoff gets it.
[01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:18.650]  I'm gonna bid sixteen on Beetlejuice.
[01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:19.050]  What the fuck?
[01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:23.510]  You guys don't have enough points to counter Geoff at sixteen, bringing him down to four points.
[01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.530]  Well, don't worry.
[01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:29.410]  I get to add nine dollars to my total amount, so...
[01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:30.250]  Wow, congratulations.
[01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:30.830]  Reagan?
[01:02:30.970 --> 01:02:31.910]  I think Reagan's...
[01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:33.610]  Guys, politics are hot right now.
[01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.470]  Reagan's gonna fucking kill.
[01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:36.430]  It is an election year.
[01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:37.610]  You have a great point.
[01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.770]  It is gonna be so interesting to see who wins this.
[01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:43.490]  I can't wait to see the results.
[01:02:43.790 --> 01:02:46.590]  I will say I have done like ten plus of these.
[01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:49.770]  I don't think I've ever ended one with people having points.
[01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:54.430]  So the fact that three of you are wrapping this up with points is insane.
[01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:59.730]  The fact that Geoff held so many points right until the end also has so many movies, that's crazy.
[01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:04.630]  I was trying to be conservative sort of like near the end because I wanted Beetlejuice.
[01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:05.950]  And then I just... it was like...
[01:03:06.590 --> 01:03:08.250]  It got to the point where it's like, here's Reagan.
[01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.170]  And it's like, Geoff is already gonna have more than me.
[01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:11.710]  So I have to spend it on something.
[01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.170]  The order of the movies makes such a difference. It's crazy.
[01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.230]  Big time.
[01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:22.170]  And I mean, I think outside of randomizing, doing in release order, I think is such a good move for this.
[01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:27.730]  Did anybody not get a movie they really secretly wanted or they were really into?
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:30.150]  I wanted Deadpool and Wolverine.
[01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:32.610]  I wanted Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4.
[01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:35.250]  But I spent too much.
[01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:39.230]  I wanted Borderlands pretty badly.
[01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.290]  But I wanted to save enough for Beetlejuice because I knew you guys would blow money.
[01:03:44.790 --> 01:03:48.870]  I really wanted the M Night movie, but I figured it would go for higher than it did
[01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.010]  because of how many points were still on the board.
[01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:54.550]  What a fucking steal. I think that's gonna crush it for me.
[01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:56.850]  I think that's gonna do so well for me.
[01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:59.590]  I think Inside Out 2 is gonna underperform.
[01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:01.990]  I could see that. It's been such a long time.
[01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.370]  Despicable Me 4 will make more money.
[01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.410]  I think Nick will win with that movie alone.
[01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:09.550]  Yes, I do. I do agree with that.
[01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:14.310]  I do think that... I think that combining so many of like these other ones or whatever
[01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:16.430]  is really cool and we'll get really close.
[01:04:16.570 --> 01:04:17.970]  I don't think it's going to touch...
[01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:21.390]  I just don't think anything's gonna touch that.
[01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.090]  It's going to run away with this shit this year.
[01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:24.770]  It's gonna be wild.
[01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:27.690]  So I think it's sort of funny to look at.
[01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.550]  And I had a panic when I was looking at it.
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.670]  People own back-to-back films.
[01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.070]  It is very possible you're competing with yourself.
[01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:39.250]  Like, I don't know that A Quiet Place Day 1 doesn't release the same day as Despicable Me 4.
[01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:40.890]  Even though they're different audiences.
[01:04:41.570 --> 01:04:43.070]  But Nick is against himself that weekend.
[01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:45.670]  I thought I was potentially against myself with Twisters and Deadpool,
[01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:47.810]  but it's a weak difference between those two.
[01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:51.210]  Oh shit, I'm against myself with 4G Slingshot.
[01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:52.570]  Gavin, you are guaranteed.
[01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.090]  That's a slingshot.
[01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:57.830]  You're gonna wake up and say,
[01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.910]  fuck, the 4G is taking all my City of Dreams money.
[01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.930]  This is bullshit.
[01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:03.850]  Yep, that's the way it goes, baby.
[01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:04.790]  This is a lot of fun, guys.
[01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:05.230]  I'm excited.
[01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.170]  I will post updates throughout the summer,
[01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.990]  and I'm sure we'll talk about it on the show and stuff.
[01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:10.110]  Put it on the, uh...
[01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:10.890]  We should make a...
[01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:13.050]  Honestly, we should make it...
[01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.390]  Like, put it on the Patreon, let people know, whatever.
[01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:16.830]  Track it on the Discord.
[01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.750]  Have people keep track of it on our Discord.
[01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:23.730]  And, like, I think that's gonna be just a shit-talking storm in there.
[01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.630]  I'm really excited.
[01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:26.790]  And let us know in the comments who you guys think is gonna win,
[01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:28.350]  based on these results and everything.
[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:31.550]  Maybe we'll put a poll or something in, like, the Patreon post for, like, who people...
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:32.870]  It's fucking...
[01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:36.770]  Like, it's crazy how much of a shit I now give about this.
[01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:37.430]  Yeah.
[01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.730]  It's a lot of fun.
[01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:42.230]  Like, I wanna build a time machine just so I can skip this summer,
[01:05:42.330 --> 01:05:43.330]  just to find out how it is.
[01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.050]  This is awesome.
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:47.550]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:48.730]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:50.870]  I'm excited to see who wins this.
[01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:52.050]  Good luck, guys.
[01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:53.690]  Don't forget, there's something on the line.
[01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:56.010]  Whoever wins gets to make a movie.
[01:05:56.550 --> 01:06:00.370]  Next time we do this, can we all sit on chairs with a little stick with a number on it?
[01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:02.010]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:03.510]  Yeah, I think we should.
[01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:07.370]  Can I ask you guys, right before we wrap up,
[01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:09.350]  if you had to pick a movie right now that we were gonna watch,
[01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:10.210]  do you know what it would be?
[01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.110]  Right now, I would say Ongback.
[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:14.770]  I've been in an Ongback.
[01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.830]  Like, I've wanted to revisit that for a while.
[01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.670]  Interesting.
[01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.630]  Can it be any movie in the world or does it have to be?
[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.970]  Yeah, any movie in the world.
[01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:21.350]  Anything.
[01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:22.850]  Oh, geez.
[01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.550]  I'd make us watch Super Fuzz.
[01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.190]  Oh, yeah.
[01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:27.610]  I've never heard of it.
[01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:28.610]  Excited.
[01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:29.610]  Well, we'll see.
[01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:30.030]  We'll find out.
[01:06:30.050 --> 01:06:31.630]  We'll see as the summer unfolds.
[01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:32.750]  Thank you so much for watching.
[01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:35.330]  Check out our Patreon if you haven't already.
[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.310]  We appreciate your support so much.
[01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.830]  Have a great day.
[01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:40.010]  Bye.
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.670]  Shit.
[01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:46.770]  15 bucks left.
[01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:52.790]  This back-to-school, head to Bells, where the little things like backpacks, sneakers,
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.910]  and that first day outfit are more than just supplies.
[01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.050]  They're moments you'll never forget.
[01:06:58.390 --> 01:07:01.290]  And Bells has big deals to make those moments count.
[01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.370]  Shoes from the brands they love.
[01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.490]  Backpacks starting at just $16.99.
[01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:07.890]  Shorts and tees from only $9.99.
[01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.570]  Everything you need for back-to-school.
[01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:11.590]  Brands.
[01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:12.070]  Style.
[01:07:12.310 --> 01:07:12.710]  Selection.
[01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.770]  Bells.
