[00:54.670 --> 00:59.570]  Hello and welcome to the movie battle of 2025.
[00:59.930 --> 01:02.010]  We are back once again.
[01:02.130 --> 01:11.470]  Your champion, your grand champion here to introduce Mr. Twisters himself in the battle.
[01:11.910 --> 01:13.390]  We're back once again.
[01:13.430 --> 01:16.990]  We have the list of summer films we're going to do an auction.
[01:17.290 --> 01:18.850]  We each have 98 points.
[01:19.150 --> 01:21.870]  We will run through each movie, bid on them.
[01:21.870 --> 01:27.390]  Then once you have all the movies that you compiled, we total the domestics across the summer.
[01:27.770 --> 01:31.950]  Whoever makes the most money with the movies they own wins the battle.
[01:33.190 --> 01:36.070]  There was some confusion last year, but then we got it.
[01:36.130 --> 01:38.170]  It went really well, I would say.
[01:38.350 --> 01:39.790]  I had a lot of fun with it as the winner.
[01:40.570 --> 01:41.610]  I thought it was great.
[01:41.730 --> 01:42.950]  The audience really liked it.
[01:43.050 --> 01:43.990]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:44.090 --> 01:50.070]  I think before we start, we should talk about the terms of where this starts and where it ends.
[01:50.070 --> 01:52.570]  What's our begin date and what's our cutoff date?
[01:53.110 --> 01:56.430]  May 1st, I believe, is our start.
[01:56.950 --> 01:59.530]  And then we end, I believe, September 1st.
[01:59.810 --> 02:01.650]  Last year we went end of September.
[02:02.250 --> 02:04.670]  We could go end of September again if we want.
[02:05.190 --> 02:07.150]  I think the last film comes out end of August.
[02:07.290 --> 02:08.570]  So maybe we go end of September.
[02:08.950 --> 02:09.950]  It's the first day of October.
[02:10.230 --> 02:13.090]  So did none of these movies come out earlier than the May 1st?
[02:13.510 --> 02:13.850]  No.
[02:14.110 --> 02:16.650]  That's a five month window to wait though.
[02:17.030 --> 02:17.810]  Pretty meaty time.
[02:18.150 --> 02:18.410]  Yeah.
[02:18.410 --> 02:20.570]  Didn't we do it longer last time?
[02:20.830 --> 02:22.990]  I know we started late last year, but maybe we didn't.
[02:23.070 --> 02:27.150]  We started like a week late, but it really was essentially the same time period.
[02:27.310 --> 02:28.130]  It went by quick.
[02:28.270 --> 02:29.150]  All right, let's do it.
[02:29.350 --> 02:30.110]  Here's the thing.
[02:30.630 --> 02:34.710]  In New York, New York, fall will officially start on September 22nd.
[02:35.370 --> 02:36.150]  There you go.
[02:36.650 --> 02:37.030]  There you go.
[02:38.070 --> 02:38.810]  Well, we live in Austin.
[02:39.450 --> 02:40.630]  Summer lasts about eight months.
[02:40.990 --> 02:41.770]  Oh, that's true.
[02:41.890 --> 02:42.450]  Okay, hang on.
[02:42.750 --> 02:46.250]  When does fall start in Austin, Texas?
[02:46.430 --> 02:47.250]  Let me find out.
[02:47.250 --> 02:48.690]  December 17th.
[02:49.650 --> 02:50.030]  Hang on.
[02:50.150 --> 02:50.470]  September.
[02:50.750 --> 02:52.010]  It is the 22nd.
[02:52.190 --> 02:55.510]  So that will be, I think maybe that's, I think maybe that's it.
[02:55.550 --> 02:57.910]  Maybe that's when the official end of this will be.
[02:57.970 --> 02:59.390]  It'd be September 22nd.
[02:59.390 --> 03:02.330]  No more past the 21st, the 22nd, the official last day.
[03:02.350 --> 03:02.490]  Okay.
[03:02.710 --> 03:03.450]  I'm okay with that.
[03:03.590 --> 03:06.450]  They're making another Jurassic World movie.
[03:06.870 --> 03:08.370]  How have you not seen the trailer for that?
[03:08.570 --> 03:09.970]  It's a video game.
[03:10.050 --> 03:10.590]  It's so crazy.
[03:10.830 --> 03:11.690]  It's kind of a reboot.
[03:12.370 --> 03:13.270]  Yeah, it is.
[03:13.650 --> 03:14.310]  They keep going.
[03:14.390 --> 03:16.810]  Those other ones aren't important, dude.
[03:16.810 --> 03:19.270]  This one, this one's for the fans.
[03:19.630 --> 03:24.230]  Isn't this one, there's like another island, but this island has all the like criminal,
[03:24.450 --> 03:28.110]  like evil dinosaurs that are just...
[03:28.110 --> 03:28.550]  The ones that were too dangerous.
[03:28.550 --> 03:30.770]  It's like the Arkham Asylum for dinosaurs.
[03:31.630 --> 03:32.510]  Australia Dinosaurs?
[03:32.970 --> 03:38.210]  Let me tell you that I'm so excited for the plot of this because people can't wait to see it,
[03:38.270 --> 03:38.890]  which is insane.
[03:39.090 --> 03:43.290]  It is, guys, there's a secret island where all the worst dinosaurs are.
[03:43.390 --> 03:43.670]  Hell yeah.
[03:43.690 --> 03:44.550]  It's like, why didn't you kill them?
[03:44.670 --> 03:44.950]  Whatever.
[03:44.950 --> 03:50.210]  But in order for us to get some kind of cure for something,
[03:50.210 --> 03:56.950]  we have to go to this secret island and collect DNA from the land dinosaur,
[03:57.170 --> 03:59.790]  the water dinosaur, and the air dinosaur.
[03:59.790 --> 04:00.450]  Oh, that's awesome.
[04:00.510 --> 04:03.050]  Like, it is a Playstation 2 game.
[04:03.270 --> 04:04.110]  That is great.
[04:04.650 --> 04:04.890]  Awesome.
[04:05.430 --> 04:07.410]  I cannot believe they made this movie.
[04:07.530 --> 04:10.370]  Why do they keep, it's the raptors and the T-Rex.
[04:10.470 --> 04:11.310]  That's what people like.
[04:11.530 --> 04:12.850]  And they keep being like, no, no, no, bigger.
[04:12.850 --> 04:15.490]  But what if we invent newer, crazier dinosaurs?
[04:16.110 --> 04:16.270]  Yeah.
[04:16.410 --> 04:18.150]  What an absolute shower of shit.
[04:18.250 --> 04:20.650]  I can't wait to put 98 points on that movie.
[04:20.930 --> 04:21.490]  Yeah, absolutely.
[04:22.610 --> 04:27.410]  Well, speaking of 98 points, we all have 98 points to bid here.
[04:27.790 --> 04:33.090]  So last time we did this, I think we took some really big swings on stuff like Minions
[04:33.090 --> 04:34.110]  and Deadpool.
[04:34.610 --> 04:40.810]  However, this run of movies here is like, this is crazy.
[04:40.810 --> 04:48.390]  There's so many big, big, big movies that if you don't get one of them, maybe you get
[04:48.390 --> 04:49.490]  one of the other ones.
[04:49.590 --> 04:52.050]  Because, dude, there's some huge ones in here.
[04:52.350 --> 04:53.330]  I'm really curious.
[04:53.490 --> 04:56.590]  We have, what is that, 39 movies to choose from?
[04:57.050 --> 04:59.950]  So let's get started.
[05:00.310 --> 05:06.370]  Well, we start with a very divisive film on the list of how we want to approach it.
[05:06.370 --> 05:11.910]  Uh, Horizon and American Saga, chapter two, not scheduled.
[05:12.310 --> 05:15.990]  We did have a fight on the podcast, a fight, maybe strong word.
[05:16.870 --> 05:20.830]  Gavin had it last year, last battle, didn't come out.
[05:20.950 --> 05:24.110]  It got pushed out of the schedule and he wanted to back in.
[05:24.530 --> 05:27.890]  We made a compromise at the time that he could bid on it and then it goes into the pool.
[05:28.230 --> 05:29.990]  How are you feeling today about this, Gavin?
[05:30.250 --> 05:30.690]  Feel great.
[05:30.790 --> 05:31.890]  I get first refusal, right?
[05:32.130 --> 05:32.930]  You do.
[05:33.050 --> 05:35.550]  I don't think any of us want it, though.
[05:35.550 --> 05:36.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:36.970 --> 05:39.550]  So yeah, but for a price, it's not scheduled to come out.
[05:39.930 --> 05:43.250]  Yeah, but if I put one on it, are you saying no one else will bid too?
[05:43.430 --> 05:43.730]  You have to put six.
[05:44.030 --> 05:45.010]  One way to find out.
[05:45.110 --> 05:45.810]  It's up to you.
[05:45.910 --> 05:48.330]  But I also like that it's copied and pasted from the last thing.
[05:48.450 --> 05:50.910]  Horizon and American Saga, chapter two, box office mojo.
[05:55.170 --> 05:58.730]  That's, that's the tender, loving care that we put into the movie auction.
[05:59.030 --> 06:04.130]  Uh, so right of first refusal, Gavin, are you going to put any points on this?
[06:04.510 --> 06:04.950]  Don't want it.
[06:04.990 --> 06:05.470]  Couldn't care less.
[06:05.990 --> 06:06.470]  Yay.
[06:07.650 --> 06:12.530]  Okay, so now do we drop it or does it run up for bid for everybody?
[06:13.050 --> 06:14.070]  I think it's open to anyone.
[06:14.490 --> 06:14.930]  One.
[06:15.550 --> 06:16.430]  Eric has one.
[06:19.030 --> 06:22.110]  Going once, going twice.
[06:23.370 --> 06:27.030]  Sold to Eric for one whole point.
[06:27.350 --> 06:27.710]  I'll take it for one.
[06:27.850 --> 06:29.430]  Nobody, nobody wants it.
[06:29.530 --> 06:30.250]  I'll take it.
[06:30.350 --> 06:30.770]  That's fine.
[06:30.790 --> 06:31.830]  Who's going to buy it next year?
[06:31.830 --> 06:34.670]  I like that we had that huge, huge hockey one on the podcast.
[06:34.890 --> 06:36.170]  Couldn't give a shit about that movie.
[06:36.330 --> 06:36.950]  Of course not.
[06:39.690 --> 06:40.970]  Andrew, are you adjusting the owner?
[06:41.330 --> 06:41.950]  I'm trying.
[06:42.090 --> 06:43.210]  It's not letting me here.
[06:43.310 --> 06:43.690]  One second.
[06:43.730 --> 06:44.470]  Let me refresh it.
[06:45.090 --> 06:45.930]  Congratulations, Eric.
[06:46.210 --> 06:47.370]  Being the first person on the board.
[06:47.390 --> 06:47.530]  Thank you.
[06:47.690 --> 06:52.710]  You know, it's important to me to get on the board early, get on the board often.
[06:53.230 --> 06:57.110]  I just don't know how you're going to win Jurassic World Rebirth with 97 points.
[06:57.730 --> 06:58.750]  I don't know.
[06:58.870 --> 07:01.690]  But also it's not, it's not even ticking me down here anyway.
[07:01.690 --> 07:03.010]  So maybe I'm just okay.
[07:04.750 --> 07:06.470]  There's so many movies I want to target.
[07:07.670 --> 07:08.110]  Nope.
[07:09.230 --> 07:10.110]  Andrew, thoughts?
[07:11.250 --> 07:12.530]  Why is nothing working?
[07:12.670 --> 07:13.870]  Why is nothing working for me?
[07:14.050 --> 07:14.930]  Everything breaks.
[07:15.310 --> 07:16.370]  Everything's always breaking.
[07:16.910 --> 07:17.570]  It's my fault.
[07:18.130 --> 07:20.010]  Throw up the technical difficulty screen, Nick.
[07:20.070 --> 07:20.630]  Hang on.
[07:21.430 --> 07:21.910]  Different count.
[07:21.990 --> 07:22.370]  That's fine.
[07:22.490 --> 07:22.850]  Got it.
[07:22.970 --> 07:23.090]  Cool.
[07:23.670 --> 07:24.730]  Gonna cut that.
[07:25.070 --> 07:25.610]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:25.610 --> 07:26.490]  That's what I just said.
[07:26.670 --> 07:28.350]  I said throw up the technical difficulty screen.
[07:28.710 --> 07:29.390]  He did say that.
[07:29.670 --> 07:30.590]  I don't have that.
[07:30.590 --> 07:32.710]  Why is nothing working today?
[07:34.270 --> 07:35.450]  I have a difficulty.
[07:37.110 --> 07:39.070]  I don't know what any of these cells are supposed to do.
[07:39.730 --> 07:42.510]  None of them, none of them have any equations.
[07:42.830 --> 07:43.710]  Logic to them.
[07:44.110 --> 07:44.210]  Nope.
[07:45.070 --> 07:46.430]  It's just a flat file.
[07:47.370 --> 07:47.630]  Yeah.
[07:48.870 --> 07:49.310]  Grid.
[07:49.550 --> 07:50.250]  It's just a grid.
[07:51.210 --> 07:52.090]  How did...
[07:52.090 --> 07:52.570]  One second.
[07:52.650 --> 07:53.630]  I'm looking at the last one.
[07:54.070 --> 07:55.530]  They just have raw numbers in them.
[07:55.870 --> 07:57.150]  Yeah, it's just some numbers.
[07:58.670 --> 07:58.970]  One.
[07:59.850 --> 08:00.650]  That worked.
[08:02.630 --> 08:03.810]  Okay, so that works.
[08:04.030 --> 08:06.050]  Right, but it's not associated to anything.
[08:07.830 --> 08:08.230]  What?
[08:08.630 --> 08:09.390]  I have a second.
[08:09.750 --> 08:10.270]  One second.
[08:10.630 --> 08:11.150]  I have a second.
[08:11.210 --> 08:11.510]  One second.
[08:11.610 --> 08:12.530]  You have a backup sheet?
[08:12.770 --> 08:14.750]  I have a backup sheet and it works.
[08:15.950 --> 08:16.390]  Blink it.
[08:16.890 --> 08:18.770]  It's a good opportunity to look at some of these movies.
[08:22.530 --> 08:24.050]  Just want to hit that copy button.
[08:24.150 --> 08:24.670]  There you go.
[08:24.810 --> 08:26.490]  And then come right over to Discord.
[08:26.890 --> 08:27.550]  Drop it in.
[08:27.710 --> 08:28.250]  Paste it.
[08:28.250 --> 08:29.130]  I'm aware.
[08:29.270 --> 08:29.610]  Hit that.
[08:29.870 --> 08:31.510]  Slam that enter button one time.
[08:31.790 --> 08:32.590]  Yep, there you go.
[08:33.410 --> 08:34.610]  You need access.
[08:38.980 --> 08:39.800]  One sec.
[08:40.160 --> 08:40.740]  One sec.
[08:41.180 --> 08:41.460]  Yeah.
[08:41.880 --> 08:42.720]  Oh man.
[08:43.320 --> 08:44.540]  Don't give access though.
[08:44.600 --> 08:45.440]  Just make it public.
[08:49.360 --> 08:50.700]  There you go.
[08:50.800 --> 08:51.660]  He made it public.
[08:52.820 --> 08:55.420]  Okay, so if we say...
[08:55.420 --> 08:55.960]  Let me get this.
[08:56.180 --> 08:57.940]  This is view only.
[08:59.720 --> 09:02.540]  So go ahead and change that access there.
[09:04.080 --> 09:05.200]  It's view only.
[09:05.480 --> 09:07.480]  You want to change that from view only to edit.
[09:08.580 --> 09:10.020]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[09:10.440 --> 09:11.680]  Multiple things here.
[09:12.320 --> 09:13.500]  It should just be one.
[09:14.240 --> 09:15.060]  Uh, nope.
[09:15.080 --> 09:15.680]  Make it one video.
[09:16.400 --> 09:18.860]  Yep, but I'm modifying the list.
[09:19.940 --> 09:20.900]  Checking it twice.
[09:21.580 --> 09:26.500]  This got broken last night because there were some movies that have been cancelled and or
[09:26.500 --> 09:28.200]  moved that got edited out and I guess...
[09:28.200 --> 09:28.740]  Oh, these are different.
[09:28.740 --> 09:30.120]  This is a different list.
[09:30.380 --> 09:30.840]  Broke.
[09:32.640 --> 09:34.260]  We're seeing on-the-fly adjustments.
[09:34.400 --> 09:34.720]  I like this.
[09:36.180 --> 09:37.420]  This has been updated.
[09:38.300 --> 09:39.100]  Okay, so.
[09:39.960 --> 09:40.580]  Okay, Eric.
[09:41.060 --> 09:41.400]  There we go.
[09:41.900 --> 09:42.560]  Now we're all good.
[09:42.800 --> 09:43.280]  We're back.
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.380]  It didn't deduct anything.
[09:45.980 --> 09:47.180]  Are we ready for the next film?
[09:47.620 --> 09:48.140]  It didn't deduct.
[09:48.400 --> 09:50.980]  I'm not sure what we are saying that he's not hearing.
[09:51.360 --> 09:51.820]  Oh, it's not?
[09:51.900 --> 09:52.640]  It didn't remove anything?
[09:54.220 --> 09:55.140]  That's unfortunate.
[09:55.140 --> 09:57.140]  What were you basing it's working on?
[09:57.960 --> 10:01.020]  I was just really excited that the owner box now works.
[10:02.440 --> 10:03.920]  The owner box worked fine.
[10:04.040 --> 10:05.140]  I was doing it.
[10:07.380 --> 10:08.340]  Well, that deducted.
[10:08.380 --> 10:09.700]  When you put it in there, it deducted it.
[10:09.740 --> 10:10.560]  Yes, absolutely.
[10:10.800 --> 10:12.600]  And so I'll just have to do that, I guess.
[10:13.160 --> 10:14.960]  I don't know if we can trust you to do that every time.
[10:15.340 --> 10:17.660]  You can keep an eye on it and you can let me know.
[10:17.780 --> 10:19.140]  Gavin, also check it out.
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.160]  You can click on that link and Gavin can do it.
[10:21.460 --> 10:21.960]  That's a good point.
[10:22.460 --> 10:23.040]  Any thoughts?
[10:23.380 --> 10:24.460]  I'm not really an Excel guy.
[10:24.940 --> 10:25.240]  Yeah.
[10:25.240 --> 10:25.360]  Yeah.
[10:25.520 --> 10:28.760]  So just keep a fucking eye on it, I guess.
[10:30.560 --> 10:32.040]  Are we ready for the next film?
[10:32.320 --> 10:34.000]  That's the most Gavin thing.
[10:34.140 --> 10:35.020]  Hey, this video's out.
[10:35.080 --> 10:36.500]  I have some ideas for some changes.
[10:36.760 --> 10:37.000]  What?
[10:37.980 --> 10:39.200]  Is this video out already?
[10:39.700 --> 10:40.360]  Oh, my God.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.260]  We'll be when they hear it.
[10:44.720 --> 10:45.920]  Hey, we're back.
[10:46.260 --> 10:47.380]  The sheet is fixed.
[10:47.380 --> 10:47.920]  Not really.
[10:48.160 --> 10:50.260]  But guys, we're moving on to the next movie.
[10:50.340 --> 10:51.220]  I now own one.
[10:51.360 --> 10:53.700]  But next movie, Shadow Force.
[10:53.700 --> 10:55.020]  Shadow Force.
[10:55.180 --> 10:56.880]  It's an action movie.
[10:57.240 --> 10:58.620]  Shadow Force, go on one.
[10:58.700 --> 10:59.900]  It has Method Man in it.
[11:00.560 --> 11:01.500]  Oh, Method Man?
[11:01.700 --> 11:03.080]  Method Man's in it.
[11:03.560 --> 11:04.620]  Joe Carnahan film.
[11:05.020 --> 11:05.580]  One, why not?
[11:05.940 --> 11:06.760]  Nick has one.
[11:07.220 --> 11:07.600]  There you go.
[11:07.720 --> 11:09.000]  It's an early May release.
[11:09.760 --> 11:11.540]  Anybody want to go more than one?
[11:12.160 --> 11:12.640]  Absolutely not.
[11:12.920 --> 11:14.000]  One going once.
[11:15.200 --> 11:15.840]  One going twice.
[11:15.940 --> 11:17.380]  Honestly, one is a great deal.
[11:18.020 --> 11:19.960]  Sold to Nick for one.
[11:20.500 --> 11:21.340]  Oh, there you go.
[11:21.480 --> 11:22.820]  I can handle the left.
[11:23.220 --> 11:24.480]  Sure, works for me.
[11:24.960 --> 11:26.200]  If it was a great deal, why didn't you bid?
[11:26.580 --> 11:27.820]  Because I just I didn't.
[11:27.960 --> 11:28.760]  I felt like I shouldn't.
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.180]  As I said it, I felt like, you know, I don't know.
[11:32.560 --> 11:33.440]  I'm counting down.
[11:33.500 --> 11:34.960]  I felt like that would be a jerk move in that moment.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.060]  I didn't want it that much.
[11:36.060 --> 11:40.120]  But if you can get a movie for one, that'll probably make like 30, 40 million at least.
[11:40.360 --> 11:41.520]  Yeah, that's a little something.
[11:41.700 --> 11:42.160]  That's solid.
[11:42.560 --> 11:43.500]  You need this.
[11:43.580 --> 11:44.620]  A little walking around money.
[11:45.080 --> 11:45.780]  Moving on.
[11:46.320 --> 11:48.280]  The first big film.
[11:49.280 --> 11:50.000]  What's Thunderbolts?
[11:50.160 --> 11:51.600]  Do you honestly do you think so?
[11:51.600 --> 11:53.460]  Marvel thinks so.
[11:53.500 --> 11:54.720]  Marvel certainly hopes so.
[11:54.780 --> 11:55.880]  They need it to be big.
[11:57.040 --> 11:58.240]  Other recent movies.
[11:58.440 --> 12:03.100]  I feel like this one actually has, aside from Deadpool, Wolverine has the potential to be decent.
[12:05.500 --> 12:07.440]  Decent is sort of where we're at.
[12:07.760 --> 12:08.020]  One.
[12:08.520 --> 12:09.660]  I'll go two.
[12:10.560 --> 12:12.300]  It is three, four.
[12:12.820 --> 12:13.780]  I'll go six.
[12:14.340 --> 12:14.620]  Wow.
[12:14.700 --> 12:14.980]  Seven.
[12:15.460 --> 12:15.860]  Oh, wow.
[12:16.140 --> 12:16.260]  Eight.
[12:16.800 --> 12:18.400]  And you're going eight with Thunderbolts.
[12:18.800 --> 12:19.160]  All right.
[12:19.200 --> 12:19.580]  Nine.
[12:20.280 --> 12:20.700]  Wow.
[12:20.700 --> 12:21.440]  Nine.
[12:22.460 --> 12:24.120]  What don't I know about this?
[12:24.760 --> 12:25.580]  Florence Pugh.
[12:25.580 --> 12:26.100]  Everything, apparently.
[12:27.320 --> 12:28.000]  I'll go ten.
[12:28.540 --> 12:31.920]  We said here's Thunderbolts and you said what's Thunderbolts?
[12:32.520 --> 12:32.980]  Eleven.
[12:33.980 --> 12:35.740]  I mean, Florence Pugh is a big name.
[12:36.640 --> 12:36.800]  Yeah.
[12:37.040 --> 12:38.300]  David Harbour is in it as well.
[12:38.760 --> 12:39.460]  Bucky's in it.
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.500]  I'll go twelve.
[12:41.160 --> 12:41.620]  Wow.
[12:42.240 --> 12:43.580]  Damn, do I need to get in on this?
[12:43.960 --> 12:44.180]  Thirteen.
[12:44.460 --> 12:45.160]  Yeah, jump on.
[12:45.560 --> 12:46.760]  Go, Gavin, do it.
[12:47.200 --> 12:47.660]  Fourteen.
[12:47.940 --> 12:48.740]  You can have my spot.
[12:48.820 --> 12:49.380]  I'm stepping out.
[12:50.080 --> 12:50.600]  Wow.
[12:50.800 --> 12:51.960]  Fourteen to Andrew.
[12:55.860 --> 12:56.380]  Fifteen.
[12:56.820 --> 12:57.340]  Wow.
[12:59.120 --> 12:59.440]  I'm out.
[12:59.540 --> 13:00.520]  I'm out on fifteen.
[13:01.160 --> 13:02.420]  Fifteen going one.
[13:03.000 --> 13:03.260]  Okay.
[13:03.740 --> 13:05.420]  Fifteen going twice.
[13:06.700 --> 13:09.400]  Congratulations, Nick, you have Thunderbolts.
[13:09.840 --> 13:11.700]  Oh, I'm having flashbacks to last year.
[13:11.920 --> 13:13.280]  That might be a bargain.
[13:13.620 --> 13:14.160]  It could be.
[13:14.360 --> 13:16.960]  I don't think it's a bad move.
[13:17.480 --> 13:21.100]  Um, no, but this hurt me last year too, you know?
[13:21.560 --> 13:22.820]  It's such a question mark.
[13:23.100 --> 13:27.260]  It's going to be it's going to be interesting this season because there's so many different
[13:27.260 --> 13:29.300]  movies that are worth spending money on.
[13:29.580 --> 13:33.680]  I think a lot of really good stuff is going to go for a lot less because we're just going
[13:33.680 --> 13:36.220]  to have to be more judicious with our points.
[13:36.580 --> 13:36.900]  Yes.
[13:37.660 --> 13:39.820]  Next film on the list is Magic Farm.
[13:40.280 --> 13:42.380]  All right, Gavin, would you want to throw fifteen on this one or what?
[13:42.920 --> 13:43.720]  Magic Farm.
[13:43.720 --> 13:47.440]  A media crew mistakenly ends up in the wrong country while trying to profile a musician
[13:47.440 --> 13:52.260]  as they collaborate with locals to create a viral trend relationships form amid an unfolding
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.260]  health crisis.
[13:53.560 --> 13:54.420]  What the fuck?
[13:54.480 --> 13:56.140]  There's so many things happening in that movie.
[13:56.220 --> 13:57.680]  It's a magic farm, Nick.
[13:58.400 --> 14:00.080]  It's also 93 minutes, though.
[14:00.360 --> 14:01.500]  Yeah, it good run time.
[14:01.580 --> 14:02.000]  You know what?
[14:02.460 --> 14:05.740]  I'm going to say one because I think it has Chloe Savigne in it.
[14:06.100 --> 14:06.680]  She does.
[14:07.200 --> 14:08.300]  Is that how you say her name?
[14:08.300 --> 14:08.780]  She does.
[14:09.060 --> 14:09.540]  She does.
[14:09.740 --> 14:11.160]  I think Chloe Savigne's in it.
[14:11.180 --> 14:11.960]  She does.
[14:14.260 --> 14:16.740]  Is that how you say her last name?
[14:17.580 --> 14:17.700]  Yeah.
[14:18.760 --> 14:23.980]  Andrew, if you look at it, it is pronounced the way it's spelled.
[14:24.280 --> 14:25.160]  How have you been saying it?
[14:25.340 --> 14:26.280]  I always thought it was seven.
[14:26.380 --> 14:26.660]  Yay.
[14:27.100 --> 14:28.540]  Oh, that sounds cool.
[14:28.720 --> 14:29.900]  That does sound cool.
[14:29.940 --> 14:31.840]  I'm sure she appreciates the upgrade.
[14:33.380 --> 14:34.420]  Chloe Savigne.
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.020]  Eric with one point on Chloe Savigne.
[14:38.580 --> 14:39.100]  Two.
[14:39.520 --> 14:40.460]  Nick just said two.
[14:40.860 --> 14:43.040]  Nick with two points on Magic Farm.
[14:43.040 --> 14:45.520]  You big Savigne head or what?
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.800]  Nick wants to own the entire weekend of May 1st or whatever.
[14:49.940 --> 14:52.660]  The first weekend is all Nick against him.
[14:53.060 --> 14:54.540]  I'm going for time here.
[14:54.700 --> 14:56.100]  Nick with two going once.
[14:56.500 --> 14:57.300]  Did that happen last year?
[14:57.940 --> 15:00.160]  Nick loves Brown Bunny and kids, so he's...
[15:00.160 --> 15:01.000]  Two going twice.
[15:01.320 --> 15:01.840]  What?
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.480]  Nick's really into early Harmony Corrine.
[15:07.400 --> 15:10.060]  Magic Farm sold to Nick with two.
[15:10.180 --> 15:10.220]  Wow.
[15:10.620 --> 15:11.720]  Nick, you got it, too.
[15:11.720 --> 15:13.060]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.210]  Are you concerned that your movies are coming out against each other or there's no concern there for you?
[15:17.760 --> 15:18.380]  I am now.
[15:18.580 --> 15:19.340]  Oh, okay.
[15:20.060 --> 15:20.520]  Cool.
[15:21.360 --> 15:21.820]  Yeah.
[15:22.420 --> 15:24.220]  Next film is Friendship.
[15:24.320 --> 15:26.820]  A suburban dad falls hard for his charismatic new neighbor.
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.920]  It's a Paul Rudd movie.
[15:29.740 --> 15:30.600]  Oh, we like Rudd.
[15:31.040 --> 15:31.560]  I'll say two.
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.960]  I'll go six on that one.
[15:34.400 --> 15:34.840]  Wow.
[15:35.420 --> 15:35.880]  Six.
[15:37.460 --> 15:40.060]  Okay, well, six is going one here.
[15:40.760 --> 15:43.500]  I think it's just going to be Jeff.
[15:43.600 --> 15:44.480]  Going twice.
[15:46.060 --> 15:47.620]  Sold to Jeff for six.
[15:48.000 --> 15:48.300]  Thank you.
[15:48.420 --> 15:52.160]  The early buzz on that movie is it is one of the funniest movies made in the last decade.
[15:52.260 --> 15:54.380]  It stars Tim Robinson, who's on top of the world right now.
[15:54.480 --> 15:57.160]  I have a pretty good feeling it's going to be like a hundred million dollar comedy.
[15:57.940 --> 15:59.500]  Premiered in 2024.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.280]  I don't think it's going to make that much.
[16:02.480 --> 16:06.440]  I think it'll make 20 million and people will really like it, but it's odd.
[16:06.560 --> 16:07.140]  I agree with that.
[16:07.400 --> 16:09.440]  I don't think people see comedies in the theater anymore.
[16:09.440 --> 16:11.600]  It seems like such a film festival movie.
[16:11.740 --> 16:14.460]  I know what you're saying, but I think it's coming out with not a lot around it,
[16:14.500 --> 16:15.380]  except for Thunderbolts.
[16:15.460 --> 16:15.960]  I don't know.
[16:16.100 --> 16:17.040]  Tim Robinson is...
[16:17.040 --> 16:18.480]  Except for Thunderbolts!
[16:19.260 --> 16:20.040]  Except for the...
[16:20.040 --> 16:23.260]  When was the last Marvel movie outside of Daredevil that... or not Daredevil.
[16:23.300 --> 16:23.780]  The other one.
[16:24.140 --> 16:25.040]  The other red guy.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.220]  Here's the thing.
[16:26.560 --> 16:31.980]  The way to, to me, the way to judge a lot of these is what theaters are showing it.
[16:32.020 --> 16:34.340]  And the only Alamo theater showing it is South Lamar.
[16:34.440 --> 16:36.800]  There are no other Alamo theaters showing it in Austin.
[16:37.200 --> 16:37.780]  That's a good point.
[16:38.120 --> 16:41.220]  That's, that's like when a movie comes out and they show it down on Slaughter
[16:41.220 --> 16:42.620]  and all the way up at like Lakeland.
[16:42.920 --> 16:43.760]  And you go, ooh!
[16:43.900 --> 16:46.980]  That seems like approaching research for a guy who said he didn't do any research.
[16:47.540 --> 16:49.280]  Yeah, that's, you have, you have...
[16:49.280 --> 16:51.700]  Dude, I'm looking at what movies I want to see.
[16:51.780 --> 16:54.140]  I'm not looking at what movies are on this list.
[16:54.240 --> 16:55.780]  I'm just, I'm looking at the Alamo, dude.
[16:55.800 --> 16:57.760]  I got the, I got the season pass, baby.
[16:57.840 --> 17:00.860]  So what I'm hearing is that you're going to go to this movie and give me some money.
[17:00.900 --> 17:01.420]  I appreciate that.
[17:01.800 --> 17:03.980]  Uh, I'll wait till it's, I'll wait till it's on streaming.
[17:04.440 --> 17:05.160]  That's, you know what?
[17:05.160 --> 17:08.760]  I did refuse last year to go to anybody else's movies until they streamed.
[17:08.760 --> 17:11.580]  Despite interest, I'll probably hold that into this year.
[17:11.780 --> 17:14.840]  Next film, Fight or Flight, starring Josh Hartnett.
[17:15.340 --> 17:17.800]  Mercenary takes on the job of tracking down a target on a plane,
[17:17.800 --> 17:21.300]  but must protect her when they're surrounded by people trying to kill both of them.
[17:21.700 --> 17:23.340]  Hey, how many times is this movie going to come out?
[17:23.440 --> 17:24.200]  One point.
[17:24.860 --> 17:26.020]  Okay, two points.
[17:26.360 --> 17:27.900]  It's already been released internationally.
[17:28.540 --> 17:29.540]  You can have it for two.
[17:29.940 --> 17:30.920]  Going once with two.
[17:32.380 --> 17:33.760]  Going twice with two.
[17:34.700 --> 17:37.620]  I get Fight or Flight for two points.
[17:37.640 --> 17:38.080]  You get it.
[17:38.480 --> 17:39.320]  I'm so excited.
[17:39.580 --> 17:41.040]  That movie looks so much fun.
[17:41.420 --> 17:42.600]  It's such a dumb movie.
[17:42.960 --> 17:46.820]  But moving on to Not Golden, which was cancelled, which is a wild thing.
[17:47.700 --> 17:51.060]  The film of the summer, Clown in a Cornfield.
[17:52.100 --> 17:52.980]  Up for bid?
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.880]  A fading midwestern town in which Frendo the Clown, a symbol of bygone success,
[17:59.060 --> 18:00.940]  re-emerges as a terrifying scourge.
[18:01.280 --> 18:03.680]  I'll put one point on Clown in a Cornfield.
[18:03.760 --> 18:05.320]  Pennywise is going to be pissed.
[18:05.780 --> 18:09.920]  Why is the horror movie coming out in like May or June?
[18:11.500 --> 18:13.560]  Uh, they want to get in on the Oscar buzz.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.420]  Hey, by the way, just real fast.
[18:16.500 --> 18:17.760]  I should have 92 points.
[18:17.820 --> 18:20.820]  I have 98, just so we're not cheating there.
[18:21.300 --> 18:21.560]  Thanks.
[18:21.720 --> 18:22.520]  Gavin, where were you?
[18:23.540 --> 18:24.320]  Hey, what's up?
[18:25.160 --> 18:26.020]  Yeah, there you go.
[18:26.320 --> 18:28.560]  Clown in a Cornfield for one.
[18:28.740 --> 18:29.380]  Going once.
[18:29.620 --> 18:30.900]  I'll put two for it.
[18:30.940 --> 18:31.480]  Go for two.
[18:32.120 --> 18:33.300]  Two going one.
[18:33.760 --> 18:34.640]  Going once.
[18:35.360 --> 18:36.600]  Two going two.
[18:37.100 --> 18:38.060]  She does.
[18:40.260 --> 18:42.100]  Sold to Jeff.
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.640]  Bargain.
[18:44.300 --> 18:44.980]  She does.
[18:45.700 --> 18:46.140]  Once.
[18:48.320 --> 18:50.420]  Hey, guys, no worries.
[18:50.560 --> 18:52.720]  My measles vaccination is still active.
[18:52.920 --> 18:53.200]  I just found it.
[18:53.200 --> 18:54.240]  All right!
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.040]  Nice.
[18:56.280 --> 18:56.420]  Yeah.
[18:56.520 --> 18:57.240]  You might need it.
[18:57.440 --> 18:57.640]  Yeah.
[18:57.980 --> 18:58.740]  How old is it?
[18:59.640 --> 19:00.980]  I was born in 1975.
[19:03.840 --> 19:10.580]  Make your next vacation unforgettable on Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Star of the Seas.

[19:23.480 --> 19:28.000]  and even more to enjoy at our award-winning private island, Perfect Day at Coco Cay.

[19:33.760 --> 19:37.520]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[19:37.820 --> 19:40.680]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[19:40.840 --> 19:44.380]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.240]  Available for a limited time.
[19:46.500 --> 19:48.560]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[19:49.180 --> 19:53.340]  Juliet and Romeo, based on the real story that inspired Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,
[19:53.500 --> 19:55.540]  follows the greatest love story of all time,
[19:55.660 --> 19:58.180]  set as an original pop musical.
[19:58.600 --> 19:59.660]  Oh, my God.
[19:59.920 --> 20:01.100]  Oh, my God.
[20:01.180 --> 20:02.180]  I'll get one point.
[20:02.180 --> 20:03.820]  I'll say one.
[20:04.280 --> 20:05.560]  I already said one.
[20:05.780 --> 20:07.080]  I'll say two.
[20:09.980 --> 20:11.980]  Don't think it's going to do very well.
[20:12.140 --> 20:16.980]  Nothing about that Screams movie you should see, but I'll give it a shot.
[20:17.520 --> 20:18.720]  That was a true story?
[20:19.360 --> 20:21.480]  But Romeo and Juliet isn't the true story?
[20:21.800 --> 20:25.560]  Yeah, I mean, according to this lie that they're telling people, absolutely, dude.
[20:25.660 --> 20:28.340]  Juliet and Romeo going two for Eric.
[20:28.980 --> 20:29.240]  Twice.
[20:32.180 --> 20:33.340]  Three for Eric.
[20:33.700 --> 20:34.460]  There it is.
[20:34.680 --> 20:34.900]  All right.
[20:35.020 --> 20:35.340]  Sold.
[20:35.540 --> 20:36.220]  Sold to Eric.
[20:36.420 --> 20:37.280]  Going three.
[20:37.660 --> 20:38.180]  It went three.
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.500]  It went all the way to three.
[20:40.760 --> 20:40.960]  Sell Eric.
[20:41.280 --> 20:43.780]  It went all the way to three.
[20:43.880 --> 20:44.680]  You never know, Eric.
[20:44.800 --> 20:47.180]  That could be something.
[20:48.080 --> 20:48.600]  It could.
[20:49.140 --> 20:51.380]  It could be like a Rock of Ages type thing.
[20:51.580 --> 20:52.040]  Like, I don't know.
[20:52.600 --> 20:57.860]  Or like the one with Adam Devine where all the ladies sing with Anna Kendrick.
[20:58.500 --> 20:59.660]  Oh, yeah.
[20:59.820 --> 21:00.520]  Pitch perfect.
[21:01.040 --> 21:01.400]  Yes.
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.740]  Oh, it could be like Romeo and Juliet from the 90s.
[21:03.800 --> 21:04.560]  Oh, it could be.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.880]  I don't think it's going to be, but it could be.
[21:06.920 --> 21:07.360]  Uh, no.
[21:07.760 --> 21:10.420]  Well, let's hurry up tomorrow for hurry up tomorrow.
[21:10.720 --> 21:14.680]  An insomniac musician encounters a mysterious stranger leading to a journey that challenges
[21:14.680 --> 21:16.120]  everything he knows about himself.
[21:16.460 --> 21:16.680]  One.
[21:16.780 --> 21:18.760]  It's a movie with The Weeknd in it.
[21:19.000 --> 21:20.080]  I'll put two in it.
[21:20.180 --> 21:20.400]  Two down.
[21:20.880 --> 21:21.560]  Jeff with two.
[21:22.580 --> 21:23.980]  Jeff with two going once.
[21:24.740 --> 21:25.140]  Three.
[21:26.220 --> 21:27.380]  Eric with three.
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.180]  Eric with three going once.
[21:30.080 --> 21:30.880]  Going twice.
[21:32.100 --> 21:34.080]  Sold to Eric for three.
[21:34.920 --> 21:35.820]  Look at that, Gavin.
[21:35.860 --> 21:36.340]  Does that look cool?
[21:36.440 --> 21:37.000]  One, two, three.
[21:37.140 --> 21:37.520]  Does that look cool?
[21:37.880 --> 21:38.360]  Looks great.
[21:38.560 --> 21:39.920]  I did that for you, Gavin.
[21:40.400 --> 21:40.960]  You're doing a bit.
[21:41.620 --> 21:44.820]  Next up, final destinations.
[21:45.160 --> 21:45.760]  This is wrong, right?
[21:45.780 --> 21:46.700]  I got this for two, right?
[21:47.200 --> 21:49.340]  That's because you said going three and you fucked yourself.
[21:49.800 --> 21:49.860]  Sure.
[21:52.520 --> 21:54.880]  Final destination bloodlines.
[21:55.320 --> 21:56.900]  Next up on the list.
[21:57.240 --> 21:57.800]  I'll get one.
[21:58.240 --> 21:59.120]  Let me read the...
[21:59.120 --> 22:04.140]  Plagued by a recurring violent nightmare, a college student returns home to find the
[22:04.140 --> 22:08.760]  one person who can break the cycle and save her family from the horrific fate that inevitably
[22:08.760 --> 22:09.340]  awaits them.
[22:09.440 --> 22:10.560]  I'll go four.
[22:11.420 --> 22:11.980]  Five.
[22:12.500 --> 22:12.820]  Six.
[22:13.700 --> 22:13.960]  Seven.
[22:14.700 --> 22:15.260]  Eight.
[22:15.840 --> 22:16.400]  Nine.
[22:18.680 --> 22:19.680]  I'll go ten.
[22:20.660 --> 22:22.020]  Nick went ten.
[22:22.400 --> 22:22.940]  I'll go eleven.
[22:23.600 --> 22:24.960]  I'll go fourteen.
[22:26.720 --> 22:28.240]  Spice it up a little bit.
[22:28.860 --> 22:29.420]  Wow.
[22:33.000 --> 22:34.100]  Going once.
[22:36.020 --> 22:37.140]  Going twice.
[22:37.620 --> 22:37.840]  I'm out.
[22:38.740 --> 22:40.840]  Sold to me for fourteen.
[22:41.560 --> 22:42.120]  Fourteen.
[22:42.340 --> 22:42.800]  Well done.
[22:43.800 --> 22:44.360]  Fourteen.
[22:44.360 --> 22:44.900]  Got him, Jeff.
[22:44.980 --> 22:45.440]  We got him.
[22:48.300 --> 22:49.660]  Jeff, Jeff, our plan's working.
[22:50.800 --> 22:55.020]  They met beforehand and they're like, we are going to get Andrew above thirteen on final
[22:55.020 --> 22:55.580]  destination.
[22:56.680 --> 22:57.620]  Fuck him up.
[22:57.620 --> 22:59.200]  Next film is The Ruse.
[22:59.540 --> 23:03.580]  An in-home caregiver fears for her life after being assigned to a mysterious elderly patient
[23:03.580 --> 23:05.440]  in a remote seaside home.
[23:06.520 --> 23:07.360]  Nick with one.
[23:09.760 --> 23:11.220]  Nick with one going once.
[23:11.260 --> 23:12.780]  Go ahead and just lock that one in.
[23:13.100 --> 23:14.040]  Going twice.
[23:14.500 --> 23:17.240]  Nick's gonna dregs it all the way to the finish line.
[23:17.880 --> 23:20.900]  Sold to Nick for one point.
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.180]  Gonna dregs it.
[23:22.380 --> 23:24.320]  I think you're gonna, you're gonna end up with quite a total here.
[23:25.000 --> 23:25.880]  The first.
[23:26.340 --> 23:26.720]  Yeah.
[23:26.720 --> 23:29.400]  Well, I mean, there could be some big hits.
[23:29.480 --> 23:30.280]  We don't know about Thunderbolts.
[23:30.440 --> 23:31.740]  We don't know about Julian Romeo.
[23:32.320 --> 23:33.680]  But the first established.
[23:34.160 --> 23:35.780]  We don't know about Clown in a cornfield.
[23:38.260 --> 23:38.960]  Massive hit.
[23:39.040 --> 23:39.420]  Jeff does.
[23:39.620 --> 23:41.500]  Mission Impossible, The Final Reckoning.
[23:42.060 --> 23:42.340]  One.
[23:43.020 --> 23:43.900]  I had a feeling.
[23:44.420 --> 23:44.900]  Thirteen.
[23:45.820 --> 23:46.620]  Eric with thirteen.
[23:46.920 --> 23:47.480]  Nick fourteen.
[23:48.620 --> 23:49.100]  Sixteen.
[23:49.640 --> 23:50.120]  Eighteen.
[23:51.080 --> 23:51.560]  Nineteen.
[23:52.300 --> 23:55.260]  Uh, I'll say, I'll say twenty.
[23:55.400 --> 23:55.880]  I'll go with twenty.
[23:56.720 --> 23:57.380]  Eric with twenty.
[23:57.980 --> 23:58.540]  Going once.
[24:00.040 --> 24:00.720]  Eric with twenty.
[24:01.300 --> 24:01.960]  Going twice.
[24:02.400 --> 24:02.860]  Ah, twenty-one.
[24:02.900 --> 24:03.220]  Twenty-one.
[24:03.940 --> 24:04.380]  Oh yeah!
[24:06.200 --> 24:08.680]  Nope, Gavin got it in there before you did, Andrew, you'll see.
[24:08.680 --> 24:09.200]  You did.
[24:10.040 --> 24:11.400]  Oh, that was you bidding?
[24:11.540 --> 24:12.800]  I thought you were just repeating what I was saying.
[24:12.820 --> 24:13.080]  Yes, nope.
[24:13.480 --> 24:13.680]  Nope.
[24:14.140 --> 24:14.880]  We both did it.
[24:15.120 --> 24:16.080]  It was instant.
[24:16.780 --> 24:17.680]  I'll go twenty-two.
[24:19.220 --> 24:19.740]  Twenty-three.
[24:20.500 --> 24:21.620]  You're in again?
[24:22.840 --> 24:24.120]  I was never out, baby.
[24:24.180 --> 24:25.460]  I was buying my time.
[24:25.460 --> 24:27.840]  Yeah, he was, he was sat in the shadows.
[24:28.660 --> 24:30.240]  Yeah, I'll go twenty-four.
[24:30.600 --> 24:31.460]  Uh, twenty-five.
[24:31.900 --> 24:32.620]  Twenty-six.
[24:35.120 --> 24:36.060]  Twenty-seven.
[24:38.180 --> 24:40.160]  Nick being back in is hilarious.
[24:43.240 --> 24:44.840]  Twenty-seven, going once.
[24:46.260 --> 24:46.820]  That's a bargain.
[24:47.220 --> 24:48.360]  Seven, going twice.
[24:49.200 --> 24:49.820]  Twenty-eight.
[24:51.280 --> 24:52.080]  Twenty-nine.
[24:52.760 --> 24:54.580]  Where did you come from again?
[24:54.580 --> 24:55.760]  That's what you're doing.
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.360]  He keeps doing it.
[24:57.500 --> 24:58.760]  Nick is pure chaos.
[24:59.780 --> 25:01.880]  Twenty-nine, going once.
[25:03.100 --> 25:04.840]  Twenty-nine, going twice.
[25:06.720 --> 25:09.880]  Sold to Nick for twenty-nine points.
[25:10.420 --> 25:11.220]  Congratulations, Nick.
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.280]  I think it's a really good pickup.
[25:12.520 --> 25:14.560]  That's, that's an easy Hoff bill, I reckon.
[25:15.040 --> 25:15.840]  That's a, that's a deal.
[25:16.480 --> 25:19.260]  He's got the double whammy of Thunderbolts and Mission Impossible.
[25:19.740 --> 25:20.000]  Yeah.
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.400]  If that Marvel movie's a hit, it might already be over.
[25:23.290 --> 25:27.320]  Next up is Lilo and Stitch, the live-action remake.
[25:27.920 --> 25:28.000]  What?
[25:28.220 --> 25:28.480]  Fifteen.
[25:29.980 --> 25:30.840]  Fifteen.
[25:31.220 --> 25:31.640]  Sixteen.
[25:32.300 --> 25:32.800]  Seventeen.
[25:33.260 --> 25:33.800]  Twenty.
[25:34.260 --> 25:35.460]  Twenty-one.
[25:35.840 --> 25:36.520]  Twenty-five.
[25:37.300 --> 25:38.020]  Twenty-nine.
[25:47.450 --> 25:50.050]  Twenty-nine, going once.
[25:50.630 --> 25:51.270]  I'll go thirty.
[25:52.210 --> 25:53.270]  Thirty-one.
[25:54.750 --> 25:55.910]  Who had it at twenty-nine?
[25:56.510 --> 25:57.110]  I did.
[25:57.430 --> 25:57.770]  Andrew?
[25:58.310 --> 25:58.930]  Thirty-two.
[25:59.830 --> 26:02.470]  What the fuck does that mean?
[26:02.470 --> 26:07.110]  This is the craziest, what is up with everyone?
[26:07.790 --> 26:10.170]  Wait, wasn't it at thirty-one before I said thirty-two?
[26:10.490 --> 26:11.010]  It was.
[26:11.130 --> 26:12.010]  Yeah, you just came out of nowhere.
[26:12.110 --> 26:12.630]  What's wrong with you?
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.570]  Thirty-three.
[26:13.910 --> 26:15.350]  I'm wondering where you came from.
[26:15.610 --> 26:16.970]  He was biding his time.
[26:17.290 --> 26:19.630]  No, I was wondering where Andrew came from and then I found out.
[26:20.710 --> 26:21.110]  What?
[26:22.930 --> 26:24.430]  He's been here the whole time, man.
[26:25.270 --> 26:26.670]  Going with thirty-three.
[26:27.910 --> 26:29.370]  Wait, who has thirty-three?
[26:32.090 --> 26:34.690]  Open... kick the cats out and open a window, dude.
[26:34.930 --> 26:36.630]  Yeah, but everyone's yelling, so...
[26:36.630 --> 26:37.070]  Thirty-four.
[26:37.550 --> 26:38.310]  Thirty-five.
[26:39.330 --> 26:40.710]  Thirty-five, going once.
[26:43.790 --> 26:45.610]  Is that thirty-six?
[26:45.870 --> 26:46.110]  Yeah.
[26:46.450 --> 26:47.430]  Thirty-seven.
[26:49.710 --> 26:51.790]  Thirty-seven, going once.
[26:53.250 --> 26:55.250]  Thirty-seven, going twice.
[26:55.570 --> 26:56.410]  That's thirty-eight.
[26:57.890 --> 27:00.370]  You know you can bid before I say twice.
[27:00.850 --> 27:01.450]  Thirty-nine.
[27:01.650 --> 27:02.190]  You can just bid.
[27:02.250 --> 27:03.350]  You're gonna be in trouble.
[27:03.990 --> 27:04.590]  Thirty-nine.
[27:04.590 --> 27:05.990]  He said nothing but thirty-nine.
[27:07.870 --> 27:09.250]  Thirty-nine, bid before you bid.
[27:09.510 --> 27:11.070]  Thirty-nine, going once.
[27:12.690 --> 27:14.850]  Who's at... hang on, wait, before you keep counting it down.
[27:14.850 --> 27:15.210]  Wait, what's going on?
[27:15.210 --> 27:16.230]  Who's at thirty-nine?
[27:16.670 --> 27:17.470]  I'm at thirty-nine.
[27:17.770 --> 27:18.710]  I just want to be clear.
[27:19.090 --> 27:20.070]  You're at thirty-nine?
[27:20.170 --> 27:21.350]  Gavin, you're at thirty-eight.
[27:21.350 --> 27:22.790]  This is why I brought it up.
[27:22.870 --> 27:26.430]  No, no, Gavin said thirty-eight, and then Andrew started chastising him for waiting,
[27:26.610 --> 27:29.510]  and while he was saying that, Gavin said thirty-nine, before Andrew got a chance.
[27:29.530 --> 27:31.510]  It's been so early, he hadn't bid yet.
[27:31.590 --> 27:32.730]  Okay, he just bid again?
[27:32.870 --> 27:34.790]  Yeah, and he said I said it before he said once.
[27:35.070 --> 27:35.430]  Yeah, okay.
[27:35.430 --> 27:36.310]  You outbid yourself?
[27:36.730 --> 27:37.470]  Yeah, I outbid myself.
[27:38.190 --> 27:38.690]  Oh, shit.
[27:39.110 --> 27:39.650]  It's irrelevant now.
[27:42.050 --> 27:43.370]  This is insane.
[27:44.370 --> 27:45.510]  Forty, going once.
[27:46.010 --> 27:47.670]  Forty-one, forty-two.
[27:48.670 --> 27:49.070]  Why?
[27:52.350 --> 27:54.910]  Gavin with forty-two, going once.
[27:55.810 --> 27:56.210]  Oh.
[27:57.110 --> 27:57.510]  Twice.
[27:59.450 --> 28:02.070]  Sold to Gavin for forty-two points.
[28:02.630 --> 28:02.770]  Wow.
[28:03.790 --> 28:04.730]  That may have been a mistake.
[28:05.090 --> 28:06.370]  It looks like dog shit.
[28:06.590 --> 28:07.410]  Gavin is on the board.
[28:07.750 --> 28:10.910]  But it's Disney, there's no way it does not make money.
[28:10.990 --> 28:11.870]  Yeah, it's kids in that.
[28:12.150 --> 28:13.370]  Kids love the movies.
[28:14.110 --> 28:16.470]  I don't know, the new Snow White didn't do super well, did it?
[28:16.730 --> 28:17.690]  No, and it was terrible.
[28:18.310 --> 28:20.730]  It still made like three hundred million or something, didn't it?
[28:20.730 --> 28:21.570]  Yeah, I don't know.
[28:21.650 --> 28:23.650]  Like, you guys are like, yeah, that movie sucked.
[28:23.790 --> 28:24.870]  I don't think that matters.
[28:25.210 --> 28:26.930]  That's totally irrelevant to what we're doing here.
[28:27.070 --> 28:28.470]  Eventually, they might get wise.
[28:28.750 --> 28:31.810]  I don't, I, dude, I don't think so, man.
[28:32.110 --> 28:33.730]  Next film is Bring Her Back.
[28:34.490 --> 28:38.570]  A brother and sister recover a terrifying ritual at the secluded home of their new foster mother.
[28:39.230 --> 28:39.250]  One, two.
[28:39.610 --> 28:40.970]  With one, two.
[28:41.910 --> 28:42.490]  For Eric.
[28:42.850 --> 28:45.730]  By the way, just so we're clear, it only made eighty-four million dollars, Snow White.
[28:46.150 --> 28:46.470]  Domestic?
[28:47.190 --> 28:47.410]  Yeah.
[28:48.270 --> 28:48.670]  Wow.
[28:48.670 --> 28:51.150]  Lilo and Stitch looks good, though.
[28:51.410 --> 28:51.710]  Bad.
[28:51.990 --> 28:52.390]  No, it doesn't.
[28:52.430 --> 28:52.910]  I disagree.
[28:53.670 --> 28:56.050]  Going once for two with Eric.
[28:56.330 --> 28:56.930]  Bring Her Back.
[28:58.330 --> 28:58.730]  Twice.
[29:00.410 --> 29:01.490]  Sold to Eric.
[29:01.710 --> 29:01.970]  Cool.
[29:02.270 --> 29:02.930]  Two points.
[29:03.390 --> 29:06.390]  I don't think it's going to do super, super well, but I think it's going to do pretty good.
[29:06.510 --> 29:11.250]  I think it's the, I think it's the guys who made, uh, was it Talk to Me or whatever?
[29:11.470 --> 29:11.890]  It is, yeah.
[29:12.190 --> 29:12.430]  Yeah.
[29:12.590 --> 29:16.190]  I could definitely see it being like one of those hereditary type successes where,
[29:16.370 --> 29:18.210]  where it's like a really popular.
[29:18.210 --> 29:19.550]  Yes, exactly.
[29:19.730 --> 29:19.910]  Yeah.
[29:19.930 --> 29:24.110]  We're like, it's, it's like the, the arthouse horror thing that like fits.
[29:24.530 --> 29:25.330]  You got that at a bargain.
[29:25.530 --> 29:26.090]  Yeah, definitely.
[29:27.510 --> 29:31.390]  Speaking of arthouse classics, Karate Kid Legends.
[29:31.790 --> 29:32.130]  One.
[29:32.630 --> 29:33.530]  What is this?
[29:33.670 --> 29:38.370]  After Kung Fu prodigy Lee Fong relocates to New York City, he attracts unwanted attention
[29:38.370 --> 29:43.170]  from a local karate champion and embarks on a journey to enter the ultimate karate competition
[29:43.170 --> 29:45.770]  with the help of Mr. Han and Daniel LaRusso.
[29:46.250 --> 29:48.190]  It is the Avengers Karate Kid
[29:48.190 --> 29:51.330]  Styles as Jackie Chan and the original guy.
[29:51.470 --> 29:53.950]  They're bringing both versions together.
[29:54.310 --> 29:56.030]  Ralph Macchio is in a movie.
[29:56.430 --> 29:56.950]  He's back.
[29:57.710 --> 30:00.470]  Well, he's also been on the Karate Kid TV show on Netflix.
[30:00.770 --> 30:01.050]  Yeah, so what?
[30:01.530 --> 30:02.010]  Right.
[30:02.330 --> 30:03.250]  Five seasons or whatever.
[30:03.550 --> 30:05.090]  I'll do is you said five seasons.
[30:05.150 --> 30:05.770]  I'll say five.
[30:05.990 --> 30:07.450]  I'll put five on Karate Kid Legends.
[30:08.010 --> 30:09.670]  I'll bid eight on the Karate Kid.
[30:10.270 --> 30:12.910]  I'll bid nine on the Karate Kid.
[30:13.870 --> 30:14.970]  Oh, too rich for my blood.
[30:15.450 --> 30:15.830]  Ten.
[30:16.690 --> 30:17.950]  I'll bid 13.
[30:19.730 --> 30:20.610]  Oh, 15.
[30:23.810 --> 30:25.330]  Uh, 15 going once.
[30:27.370 --> 30:28.790]  15 going twice.
[30:30.630 --> 30:31.490]  Sold to Jeff.
[30:31.850 --> 30:33.270]  Okay, 15 points.
[30:33.750 --> 30:36.070]  Dang, that could be a really good buy, Jeff.
[30:36.390 --> 30:37.190]  I like Jackie Chan.
[30:37.570 --> 30:39.510]  I really don't know how to judge that movie yet.
[30:39.730 --> 30:40.050]  Me neither.
[30:40.190 --> 30:41.050]  I have no idea.
[30:41.210 --> 30:42.590]  I can't believe that's crazy.
[30:42.950 --> 30:45.790]  Yeah, I saw the trailer for it this weekend and I was blown away that it existed.
[30:45.790 --> 30:51.870]  Next film up is The Phoenician Scheme, a story of a family and a family business.
[30:52.270 --> 30:52.710]  Five.
[30:54.030 --> 30:54.390]  Six.
[30:55.010 --> 30:55.450]  Ten.
[30:56.170 --> 30:57.450]  Well, what do people know about this movie?
[30:57.970 --> 30:59.330]  It's a Wes Anderson film.
[30:59.630 --> 30:59.970]  Oh.
[31:02.490 --> 31:05.450]  Which means everybody's going to love it and nobody's going to see it in the theater.
[31:05.990 --> 31:06.150]  Yep.
[31:06.650 --> 31:08.170]  Who has 10, Suri?
[31:08.470 --> 31:08.710]  Me.
[31:09.230 --> 31:10.530]  Eric with 10 going once.
[31:10.870 --> 31:11.550]  Too rich for my blood.
[31:12.590 --> 31:13.510]  It's gonna be an awesome movie, though.
[31:13.990 --> 31:16.270]  Sold to Eric for 10 points.
[31:16.790 --> 31:17.470]  Once it's on streaming.
[31:17.990 --> 31:18.090]  Yeah.
[31:18.530 --> 31:21.770]  Yeah, it's not gonna do... I don't think it's gonna do huge, huge, but I think it'll be...
[31:22.270 --> 31:24.190]  that'll be a nice little bump for me.
[31:24.290 --> 31:25.490]  I have, like, a lot of small stuff.
[31:25.610 --> 31:27.070]  I got, like, a lot of small stuff, so...
[31:27.070 --> 31:28.410]  Who's the main character in that one?
[31:28.750 --> 31:30.070]  Benicio del Toro, I think.
[31:30.390 --> 31:30.850]  Okay, cool.
[31:31.250 --> 31:31.550]  Awesome.
[31:32.130 --> 31:37.270]  Next film up is Ballerina, an assassin train in the traditions of the Ruska Roma organization
[31:37.270 --> 31:40.610]  sets out to seek revenge after her father's death.
[31:41.030 --> 31:41.510]  I'll do five.
[31:42.190 --> 31:42.710]  I'll put eight.
[31:42.730 --> 31:43.170]  Ten. Six.
[31:43.170 --> 31:44.270]  Ten. Oh.
[31:44.390 --> 31:44.670]  Ooh.
[31:45.830 --> 31:46.350]  Eleven.
[31:46.730 --> 31:47.190]  Fifteen.
[31:48.090 --> 31:48.610]  Fifteen.
[31:50.490 --> 31:51.010]  Sixteen.
[31:51.550 --> 31:51.810]  Ooh.
[31:54.150 --> 31:57.530]  Gavin, you don't know what this is, probably, but this is a John Wick spinoff.
[31:57.810 --> 31:58.490]  Going once.
[31:59.150 --> 32:00.190]  What, Dangerous Animals?
[32:01.050 --> 32:01.950]  No, Ballerina.
[32:03.570 --> 32:05.150]  Doesn't even know what movie's up for bid.
[32:05.550 --> 32:06.590]  Open a window.
[32:07.790 --> 32:08.830]  Going twice.
[32:09.470 --> 32:09.990]  Seventeen.
[32:10.470 --> 32:11.930]  Eric with 17, going once.
[32:13.170 --> 32:14.010]  Going twice.
[32:15.090 --> 32:17.570]  Sold to Eric for 17 points.
[32:17.850 --> 32:18.210]  Good job.
[32:18.910 --> 32:21.850]  I don't love where I'm at numbers-wise right now.
[32:22.190 --> 32:22.810]  I'm liking it.
[32:23.250 --> 32:23.710]  That's pretty.
[32:23.790 --> 32:24.050]  Thanks, man.
[32:24.370 --> 32:28.550]  But I feel like that one's probably going to do pretty good.
[32:29.230 --> 32:30.090]  Yeah, for sure.
[32:30.170 --> 32:30.330]  I think so.
[32:30.550 --> 32:31.390]  It was a good pickup.
[32:31.810 --> 32:33.690]  Next film is Dangerous Animals.
[32:34.310 --> 32:38.690]  When a Zephyr, a savvy and free-spirited surfer, is abducted by a shark-obsessed serial killer
[32:38.690 --> 32:42.950]  and held captive on his boat, she must figure out how to escape before he carries out
[32:42.950 --> 32:45.990]  a ritualistic feeding to the sharks below.
[32:47.610 --> 32:51.710]  I was hoping this would be a sequel to Fierce Creatures, but it's not going to sound like it is.
[32:52.510 --> 32:53.870]  What the fuck?
[32:54.150 --> 32:55.970]  Nick with one on Dangerous Animals.
[32:57.190 --> 32:58.230]  Going once.
[32:59.130 --> 32:59.610]  I'll go two.
[33:00.170 --> 33:01.270]  Jeff with two.
[33:01.710 --> 33:02.970]  Oh, never mind. I'm out.
[33:03.770 --> 33:04.850]  Nick is out.
[33:07.870 --> 33:11.330]  The Jai Courtney vehicle going with two points for Jeff.
[33:11.850 --> 33:12.290]  Oh my god.
[33:12.450 --> 33:12.670]  Going once.
[33:14.070 --> 33:14.590]  Twice.
[33:16.270 --> 33:18.450]  Sold to Jeff for two points.
[33:18.710 --> 33:20.810]  Are we still doing Jai Courtney vehicles?
[33:21.550 --> 33:22.070]  Apparently.
[33:22.590 --> 33:23.670]  This is going to be his big comeback.
[33:23.990 --> 33:24.890]  That's crazy.
[33:25.410 --> 33:26.690]  That wasn't a John Wick movie, right?
[33:27.290 --> 33:28.170]  No, that one's not.
[33:28.170 --> 33:29.170]  That was a shark movie.
[33:29.550 --> 33:29.790]  Yep.
[33:30.150 --> 33:30.670]  Yep.
[33:31.110 --> 33:31.690]  The ritual.
[33:32.030 --> 33:37.110]  Two priests, one in crisis with his faith and the other confronting a turbulent past,
[33:37.590 --> 33:40.410]  must overcome their differences to perform a risky exorcism.
[33:41.070 --> 33:41.270]  Two.
[33:41.870 --> 33:42.290]  Five.
[33:42.950 --> 33:43.950]  Jeff with five.
[33:44.890 --> 33:46.630]  Jeff with five going once.
[33:47.930 --> 33:49.730]  Jeff with five going twice.
[33:50.910 --> 33:52.270]  Sold to Jeff.
[33:52.610 --> 33:52.690]  Wow.
[33:53.170 --> 33:54.190]  That's Robert De Niro.
[33:54.850 --> 33:55.150]  Yeah.
[33:56.050 --> 33:56.310]  Yeah.
[33:56.430 --> 33:58.050]  A lot of horror this summer.
[33:58.630 --> 33:58.790]  Yep.
[33:59.310 --> 34:03.170]  Next film is I Don't Understand You.
[34:03.690 --> 34:03.830]  One.
[34:04.070 --> 34:06.450]  Stranded in rural Italy without transportation or language skills,
[34:06.510 --> 34:11.170]  an American couple on the verge of adopting tries to reconnect during a disastrous vacation
[34:11.170 --> 34:14.830]  as their fears and relationship problems threatened to boil over.
[34:15.870 --> 34:16.470]  Gavin with one.
[34:17.810 --> 34:19.330]  Gavin with one going once.
[34:21.150 --> 34:22.190]  I've not heard of this.
[34:22.270 --> 34:23.210]  I don't know anything about this.
[34:23.310 --> 34:23.350]  Twice.
[34:24.070 --> 34:25.010]  Nick Kroll's in it.
[34:25.250 --> 34:25.390]  Yep.
[34:26.090 --> 34:27.250]  Sold to Gavin.
[34:27.610 --> 34:27.910]  Okay.
[34:28.310 --> 34:32.010]  I wonder if that's going to be a better bang for my buck than Lilo and Stitch.
[34:32.570 --> 34:33.790]  You know, we're going to see.
[34:34.930 --> 34:37.730]  It's got Nick Kroll in it, so at one you might have overpaid.
[34:40.230 --> 34:41.710]  Slam, slam, slam, slam.
[34:41.910 --> 34:44.710]  What's wrong with the Kroll Meister?
[34:44.930 --> 34:45.810]  No, he's fine.
[34:45.870 --> 34:46.290]  I'm kidding.
[34:46.570 --> 34:47.250]  I'm kidding.
[34:47.590 --> 34:48.190]  That's comedy.
[34:48.570 --> 34:49.370]  I like Kroll's show.
[34:49.490 --> 34:49.950]  Great show.
[34:50.330 --> 34:55.170]  Next film, live action How to Train Your Dragon as an ancient dragon.
[34:56.410 --> 34:56.610]  Eleven.
[34:56.810 --> 34:57.030]  You get it.
[34:57.130 --> 34:58.730]  It's fucking dragons and kids.
[34:59.230 --> 34:59.790]  Fifteen.
[35:00.390 --> 35:00.910]  Sixteen.
[35:01.230 --> 35:01.790]  Seventeen.
[35:02.450 --> 35:03.010]  Eighty.
[35:06.430 --> 35:07.450]  Twenty-five.
[35:07.970 --> 35:08.530]  Wow.

[35:20.380 --> 35:20.860]  Twenty-seven.
[35:21.120 --> 35:21.340]  Thirty.
[35:22.060 --> 35:23.760]  I bet that does better than the Disney one, honestly.
[35:24.080 --> 35:24.740]  It will.
[35:24.880 --> 35:25.260]  Thirty-one.
[35:25.900 --> 35:26.660]  Stick with thirty-one.
[35:27.720 --> 35:28.840]  Thirty-five.
[35:29.380 --> 35:30.180]  Thirty-six.
[35:31.060 --> 35:31.620]  Wow.
[35:32.300 --> 35:34.740]  Epic Universe is about to launch with a whole How to Train Your Dragon.
[35:35.220 --> 35:35.880]  That's true.

[35:38.340 --> 35:38.980]  Going once.
[35:42.160 --> 35:42.480]  Thirty-eight.
[35:42.900 --> 35:43.780]  Coming up.

[35:54.860 --> 35:55.580]  Forty-one.
[35:56.080 --> 35:56.760]  Wow.
[35:57.260 --> 35:59.140]  Forty-one to Nick.
[36:00.100 --> 36:00.520]  Going once.
[36:00.520 --> 36:00.880]  Oh, God.
[36:00.900 --> 36:02.080]  It's last year all over again.
[36:02.920 --> 36:03.820]  Going twice.

[36:13.420 --> 36:14.620]  Jesus Christ.
[36:14.760 --> 36:16.420]  It is just rallying back and forth.
[36:16.760 --> 36:17.560]  Nick with forty-three.
[36:17.880 --> 36:19.180]  Going once.
[36:20.460 --> 36:21.900]  Going twice.

[36:30.340 --> 36:30.700]  Wow.
[36:31.440 --> 36:33.240]  Nick with forty-five.
[36:33.240 --> 36:34.420]  Going once.
[36:34.760 --> 36:34.960]  Forty-six.
[36:35.920 --> 36:36.840]  Forty-six.
[36:37.140 --> 36:39.740]  This one movie is going to wipe out someone's wealth.
[36:40.060 --> 36:40.980]  Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:40.980 --> 36:44.460]  But it might really rocket them because this is going to...
[36:44.460 --> 36:45.480]  It's going to do so...
[36:45.480 --> 36:46.560]  Jeff, you're so fucking right.
[36:46.580 --> 36:47.300]  It's going to do so big.
[36:47.720 --> 36:48.520]  Forty-seven.
[36:48.740 --> 36:50.340]  Nick with forty-seven.
[36:50.460 --> 36:51.400]  Going once.
[36:51.880 --> 36:54.180]  Wait, was that Andrew bidding forty-six or was someone else forty-six?
[36:54.540 --> 36:55.540]  Nick, you were.
[36:55.940 --> 36:56.300]  Weren't you?
[36:56.620 --> 36:57.060]  I'm forty... what?
[36:57.800 --> 36:58.880]  Who said what?
[36:58.960 --> 36:59.860]  Who's the... I didn't bid.
[36:59.980 --> 37:01.260]  I just sometimes... okay.
[37:01.260 --> 37:03.880]  I can't tell if you're repeating... forty-eight.
[37:05.040 --> 37:06.120]  All that for that?
[37:06.840 --> 37:08.300]  Gavin with forty-eight.
[37:09.260 --> 37:10.040]  Going once.
[37:10.300 --> 37:11.080]  Whoa, he did it!
[37:11.400 --> 37:12.100]  He did it.
[37:12.740 --> 37:13.960]  Fifty going once.
[37:14.500 --> 37:16.080]  He just played me like a fiddle, didn't he?
[37:16.580 --> 37:17.520]  Going twice.
[37:20.300 --> 37:23.520]  Sold to Nick for fifty points.
[37:23.900 --> 37:25.360]  Nick's out. That's the last of Nick.
[37:26.000 --> 37:26.640]  That's it.
[37:27.080 --> 37:27.740]  It's a good get, though.
[37:27.840 --> 37:28.100]  Goddamn.
[37:28.460 --> 37:29.200]  It's a great get.
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.600]  I think... man, is it going to be...
[37:32.600 --> 37:37.880]  You have Mission Impossible Final Rationing and you have How to Train Your Dragon.
[37:38.120 --> 37:39.120]  Those are huge.
[37:39.340 --> 37:41.340]  And Thunderbolts if it's a huge hit.
[37:41.660 --> 37:43.560]  If it's like a return to form for Marvel, you know?
[37:43.920 --> 37:46.600]  It could be a definite threat in this.
[37:46.800 --> 37:48.260]  It's like it could be a billion dollars right there.
[37:48.500 --> 37:49.300]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[37:50.240 --> 37:51.200]  Hey, it's Paris.
[37:51.680 --> 37:53.840]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[37:54.000 --> 37:54.860]  Like stars.
[37:55.320 --> 37:55.580]  Duh.
[37:55.580 --> 37:59.740]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[38:00.340 --> 38:04.640]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[38:05.140 --> 38:09.360]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[38:10.080 --> 38:12.400]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[38:12.920 --> 38:13.620]  That's hot.
[38:14.260 --> 38:17.320]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[38:17.700 --> 38:19.040]  Hilton for the stay.
[38:48.700 --> 38:52.080]  Next film up is Materialist.
[38:52.900 --> 38:55.160]  A matchmaker's lucrative business is complicated
[38:55.160 --> 38:58.780]  when she falls into a toxic love triangle that threatens her clients.
[38:59.500 --> 39:00.540]  I'll go two.
[39:01.140 --> 39:02.360]  I'll go three.
[39:02.820 --> 39:03.960]  Oh, the cast is really good.
[39:04.180 --> 39:04.700]  Four.
[39:05.300 --> 39:05.820]  Five.
[39:06.460 --> 39:07.420]  Five going once.
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.580]  Someone bit up Andrew's points away.
[39:10.140 --> 39:10.760]  I'm going six.
[39:11.540 --> 39:12.400]  Jeff with six.
[39:13.360 --> 39:14.860]  Six going once.
[39:15.740 --> 39:16.960]  What does Andrew know that we don't?
[39:17.520 --> 39:18.960]  The rest of the list.
[39:19.260 --> 39:20.120]  What are you talking about?
[39:20.160 --> 39:21.240]  He's looking at Superman.
[39:21.480 --> 39:22.920]  He's looking at Jurassic World.
[39:23.480 --> 39:25.620]  He's looking at the whole fucking back half.
[39:25.880 --> 39:27.000]  Like, what are you talking about?
[39:27.580 --> 39:28.060]  Superman.
[39:28.280 --> 39:28.560]  Who cares?
[39:28.820 --> 39:32.840]  I think that's going to that's going to do what the that fucking
[39:33.400 --> 39:35.360]  It Starts With Us movie did for me last time.
[39:35.680 --> 39:39.460]  Or It Ends With Us, or We Are The Thing, or whatever the fuck it was.
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.120]  Next up is Elio, a space fanatic with an active imagination,
[39:46.500 --> 39:50.920]  finds himself on a cosmic misadventure where he must form new bombs with alien life forms,
[39:50.920 --> 39:53.420]  navigate a crisis of intergalactic proportions,
[39:53.920 --> 39:56.320]  and somehow discover who he is truly meant to be.
[39:56.820 --> 39:57.540]  I'll go two.
[39:58.120 --> 39:58.720]  Three.
[39:59.660 --> 40:00.180]  Four.
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.500]  Four going once.
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.240]  I guess five.
[40:07.360 --> 40:07.840]  I'll do five.
[40:10.060 --> 40:11.740]  It's about where it stands, huh?
[40:12.320 --> 40:12.820]  Yeah.
[40:12.980 --> 40:14.780]  This just does not look like anything.
[40:15.220 --> 40:15.820]  Six.
[40:16.360 --> 40:16.720]  Okay.
[40:18.780 --> 40:20.320]  Six going once.
[40:20.320 --> 40:21.380]  Oh god.
[40:22.080 --> 40:26.120]  It's just right on the back of How to Train Your Dragon.
[40:26.780 --> 40:30.680]  And there's just no way anyone's going to choose whatever the fuck Elio is
[40:31.400 --> 40:33.080]  over How to Train Your Dragon, right?
[40:33.940 --> 40:35.220]  Six going twice.
[40:35.760 --> 40:36.100]  Seven.
[40:36.800 --> 40:37.060]  Oh!
[40:37.820 --> 40:38.260]  Whoa!
[40:38.620 --> 40:40.060]  Jeff from the shadows.
[40:40.460 --> 40:41.160]  Out of nowhere.
[40:42.040 --> 40:42.980]  I'll go eight.
[40:43.640 --> 40:43.960]  Oh.
[40:45.160 --> 40:46.940]  Eight going once.
[40:47.940 --> 40:49.460]  Going twice.
[40:50.320 --> 40:50.700]  Nine.
[40:51.800 --> 40:52.240]  Oh!
[40:54.360 --> 40:56.360]  Is it worth the double digits for you, Andrew?
[40:56.640 --> 40:57.000]  Yeah.
[40:57.200 --> 40:58.900]  Nine going ten.
[40:59.680 --> 40:59.920]  Okay.
[41:00.620 --> 41:01.000]  Bucket.
[41:01.060 --> 41:01.560]  I'll go ten.

[41:05.900 --> 41:06.780]  Going twice.
[41:08.300 --> 41:09.640]  Sold to me for ten.
[41:10.480 --> 41:14.100]  Pixar isn't the guarantee it used to be, but it's still a Pixar film.
[41:14.460 --> 41:15.400]  It's still a Pixar film.
[41:15.780 --> 41:16.900]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[41:16.940 --> 41:18.600]  Yeah, that could be a bargain in the end.
[41:18.860 --> 41:19.020]  Yeah.
[41:19.020 --> 41:20.960]  I'm so excited for this movie.
[41:22.100 --> 41:23.340]  Next film up.
[41:23.700 --> 41:24.480]  Yeah, dude.
[41:25.360 --> 41:28.040]  28 years later.
[41:28.580 --> 41:28.800]  One.
[41:29.880 --> 41:31.120]  I'll go two.

[41:38.240 --> 41:39.140]  the island on a mission.
[41:39.280 --> 41:39.680]  You get it.

[42:02.900 --> 42:03.820]  Going twice.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.580]  Sold to Gavin for thirteen points.
[42:08.300 --> 42:09.780]  Shouldn't have outbid myself there.
[42:10.380 --> 42:10.820]  Uh, yeah.
[42:11.480 --> 42:13.980]  Very interesting, but good plan.
[42:14.060 --> 42:14.600]  I like it.
[42:15.760 --> 42:16.980]  Keep them guessing, Gavin.
[42:17.060 --> 42:17.560]  Keep them guessing.
[42:17.820 --> 42:18.000]  Yep.
[42:19.620 --> 42:21.660]  Next one on the list.
[42:22.020 --> 42:22.740]  F1.

[42:32.040 --> 42:32.760]  Six.
[42:33.640 --> 42:34.100]  Seven.
[42:34.220 --> 42:34.720]  Goddammit.
[42:35.200 --> 42:36.620]  Whoa, Jeff out of nowhere.
[42:37.100 --> 42:37.460]  Seven.
[42:38.220 --> 42:40.520]  I'll go eight because Jeff likes it and he did research.
[42:41.480 --> 42:42.200]  Nine.
[42:42.920 --> 42:43.640]  Ten.
[42:44.720 --> 42:46.640]  I love bids with question marks.

[42:49.680 --> 42:51.140]  I'll go eleven.
[42:51.940 --> 42:52.280]  Ooh.
[42:54.640 --> 42:55.380]  Twelve.
[42:56.520 --> 42:57.020]  Wow.
[42:57.560 --> 42:59.220]  Ooh, this is good.
[42:59.480 --> 42:59.880]  Interesting.
[43:00.340 --> 43:00.760]  Thirteen.
[43:01.760 --> 43:03.360]  Thirteen going once.
[43:05.180 --> 43:07.240]  Thirteen going twice.
[43:08.320 --> 43:11.920]  Sold to Jeff for thirteen points.
[43:12.340 --> 43:12.740]  There it is.
[43:13.820 --> 43:14.680]  Hell yeah, Jeff.
[43:14.800 --> 43:16.740]  I think that might be right about what it's worth.
[43:16.780 --> 43:17.080]  We'll see.
[43:17.880 --> 43:20.500]  Yeah, I think you'll scrape some money for that.
[43:20.920 --> 43:22.160]  Domestic is going to be tough.
[43:22.340 --> 43:24.080]  Like international, I think it'll probably do great.
[43:24.700 --> 43:24.880]  Yeah.
[43:25.680 --> 43:26.820]  But here, I don't know.
[43:27.860 --> 43:30.280]  Brad Pitt's a bit of a damaged brand these days, too.
[43:30.680 --> 43:31.660]  He is.
[43:31.900 --> 43:33.960]  Megan 2.0 is the next film up.
[43:34.480 --> 43:35.000]  Mithregan 2.
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.040]  Mithregan 2.
[43:38.080 --> 43:40.180]  I'm going to bid three for Mithregan 2.
[43:40.680 --> 43:41.580]  I'll bid five.
[43:42.120 --> 43:43.340]  For Mithregan 2?
[43:43.740 --> 43:45.260]  I'll bid seven.
[43:45.980 --> 43:47.700]  Seven for Mithregan 2.
[43:47.800 --> 43:48.940]  Holy shit.
[43:50.000 --> 43:50.520]  Eight.
[43:51.300 --> 43:51.820]  Wow.
[43:53.140 --> 43:55.040]  Now, do you want me to counterbid, Gavin?
[43:55.100 --> 43:56.900]  Or do you want me to wait for you to counterbid yourself?
[43:57.100 --> 43:57.780]  And then I can...
[43:57.780 --> 43:58.440]  That's up to you.
[43:58.960 --> 43:59.360]  Nine.
[44:02.820 --> 44:05.520]  You guys have got to bid Andrew's points away.
[44:06.460 --> 44:07.360]  Going once.
[44:09.020 --> 44:09.540]  Twice.
[44:10.360 --> 44:10.740]  Shit.
[44:11.320 --> 44:13.480]  Sold to me for nine points.
[44:13.680 --> 44:14.620]  I think that's a great get.
[44:14.620 --> 44:16.240]  Yeah, I think that's a pretty good get.
[44:16.620 --> 44:18.620]  Mithregan 1 was pretty good and pretty popular.
[44:19.060 --> 44:21.360]  Yeah, but are people clamoring for Mithregan 2?
[44:21.900 --> 44:25.020]  I think the marketing was strong and people remember it fondly.
[44:25.460 --> 44:26.500]  Yeah, I'm excited about it.
[44:26.640 --> 44:28.560]  I think Mithregan 3 is going to kill.
[44:29.480 --> 44:31.080]  We simply call that Mithregan.
[44:31.540 --> 44:34.520]  But we'll have to wait till next year.
[44:35.200 --> 44:38.620]  Next up is Jurassic World Rebirth.
[44:39.180 --> 44:40.520]  No need to go over that plot.
[44:40.560 --> 44:41.440]  We already did it.
[44:41.960 --> 44:42.060]  One.
[44:42.060 --> 44:44.440]  I'm going to set the bidding hide with four.
[44:44.880 --> 44:45.560]  Five.
[44:46.120 --> 44:46.840]  Six.
[44:47.540 --> 44:48.020]  Seven.
[44:48.460 --> 44:48.900]  Ten.
[44:48.960 --> 44:49.280]  Carjo.
[44:49.760 --> 44:50.120]  Whoa!
[44:50.760 --> 44:51.140]  What?
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.320]  What did you say, Gav?
[44:52.540 --> 44:53.240]  I said 42.
[44:53.700 --> 44:56.200]  Are you okay?
[44:56.480 --> 44:57.280]  I'm with 42.
[44:58.100 --> 44:59.400]  Going once.
[45:00.260 --> 45:00.700]  Whoa.
[45:01.480 --> 45:02.540]  Going twice.
[45:02.820 --> 45:03.420]  Wow.
[45:03.980 --> 45:06.760]  I don't have enough points to contend with the big hitters.
[45:07.300 --> 45:07.680]  I hear you.
[45:07.720 --> 45:11.300]  Sold to Gavin with 42 points.
[45:11.300 --> 45:14.820]  Interesting that Gavin had two 42 point movies.
[45:19.180 --> 45:20.660]  Did get there, Gav.
[45:20.920 --> 45:23.500]  Maybe a little high, but maybe a little bit high.
[45:23.920 --> 45:26.560]  Next up on the list is Superman.
[45:26.860 --> 45:27.360]  63.
[45:28.780 --> 45:29.300]  Wow.
[45:29.980 --> 45:31.880]  I love someone just pulling.
[45:32.120 --> 45:32.700]  All right, there you go.
[45:32.780 --> 45:33.080]  That's it.
[45:33.100 --> 45:33.720]  That's it for air.
[45:35.460 --> 45:35.980]  63.
[45:36.740 --> 45:37.560]  Got the movie he wanted.
[45:37.980 --> 45:40.300]  Thank you for working Andrew down just enough.
[45:40.300 --> 45:43.080]  Are you confident because it's James Gunn at the helm?
[45:43.460 --> 45:48.620]  I think that this is the turnaround DC thing that people go.
[45:48.820 --> 45:51.720]  I think it's gonna have a big opening weekend and then people are gonna go,
[45:52.040 --> 45:54.040]  hey, that Superman movie was actually pretty good.
[45:54.080 --> 45:54.760]  You should go see it.
[45:54.840 --> 45:58.120]  And then it's gonna do better like for a few weeks.
[45:58.580 --> 46:00.460]  I just think it's gonna be really strong.
[46:00.720 --> 46:01.280]  I think you could be right.
[46:01.740 --> 46:01.900]  Yeah.
[46:02.060 --> 46:02.880]  Yeah, you could be.
[46:03.040 --> 46:05.420]  Next up on the list, Smurfs.
[46:05.640 --> 46:08.120]  I also have shit for the rest of my stuff.
[46:08.120 --> 46:11.440]  So I kind of have to get one heavy hitter late to see what happens.
[46:11.680 --> 46:13.500]  So it's just between you and I now, Andrew.
[46:15.280 --> 46:17.020]  Right here, this is the boys.
[46:17.380 --> 46:19.180]  This is the rest of these movies.
[46:19.360 --> 46:20.260]  This is for the boys.
[46:20.620 --> 46:22.620]  I'll do one on Smurfs with Rihanna.
[46:23.260 --> 46:23.760]  I'll do two.
[46:24.100 --> 46:25.580]  I'll do three.
[46:26.040 --> 46:29.920]  It's weird to look back at the board and just see my load all over it.
[46:30.140 --> 46:30.980]  Where are you at, Andrew?
[46:31.180 --> 46:32.660]  I'm at three, Jeff.
[46:33.020 --> 46:33.460]  Four.
[46:34.060 --> 46:34.500]  Four?
[46:35.040 --> 46:35.300]  Yeah.
[46:35.940 --> 46:36.900]  Man, I blew this so hard.
[46:36.900 --> 46:38.180]  I'll give you Smurfs for four.
[46:38.700 --> 46:41.460]  Oh, Jeff with the four Smurfs.
[46:41.540 --> 46:43.760]  Jeff, name four Smurfs.
[46:44.460 --> 46:49.780]  Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Lazy Smurf, and Sleepy Smurf.
[46:50.380 --> 46:53.300]  I think those last two might be the same Smurf, buddy.
[46:53.580 --> 46:54.440]  Oh, I don't think so.
[46:54.760 --> 46:57.600]  It looks fucking awful.
[46:59.220 --> 47:02.620]  Next one up, I know what you did last summer.
[47:02.920 --> 47:03.620]  Brainy Smurf.
[47:04.260 --> 47:04.800]  There you go.
[47:04.960 --> 47:05.220]  Yeah.
[47:05.220 --> 47:07.900]  I'll put one point on I know what you did last summer.
[47:08.100 --> 47:09.620]  I'll go two.
[47:10.860 --> 47:12.580]  Oh, I'll go three.
[47:13.200 --> 47:15.140]  I'll go four.
[47:17.480 --> 47:18.920]  I'll give it to you for four.
[47:19.240 --> 47:19.560]  Thank you.
[47:19.800 --> 47:20.240]  Wow.
[47:20.540 --> 47:22.300]  I, Jeff, I think that's going to do pretty good.
[47:22.800 --> 47:23.220]  I hope so.
[47:23.800 --> 47:25.820]  I think Andrew's saving up for a specific one, maybe.
[47:26.320 --> 47:26.620]  Oh, yeah.
[47:26.680 --> 47:27.420]  Yeah, the next one.
[47:27.600 --> 47:28.040]  Yeah.
[47:30.080 --> 47:32.860]  Next up is the fantastic four.
[47:33.660 --> 47:34.500]  I'll go ten.
[47:34.500 --> 47:35.880]  How many points do I have?
[47:35.920 --> 47:36.320]  I can't tell.
[47:36.800 --> 47:37.300]  You have 41.
[47:37.900 --> 47:38.400]  Okay.
[47:40.180 --> 47:41.080]  What are you going?
[47:41.180 --> 47:41.480]  10?
[47:41.860 --> 47:42.360]  I'm going 10.
[47:42.960 --> 47:44.940]  I'll go 14.
[47:45.540 --> 47:46.140]  15.
[47:46.780 --> 47:47.380]  16.
[47:47.860 --> 47:48.460]  17.
[47:49.720 --> 47:50.320]  18.
[47:51.180 --> 47:51.780]  19.
[47:53.260 --> 47:54.620]  All right, I'll go 20.
[47:54.960 --> 47:55.520]  21.
[47:56.040 --> 47:56.620]  You can have it.
[47:57.900 --> 47:58.260]  Wow.
[47:58.380 --> 47:58.980]  Wow.
[47:59.820 --> 48:00.880]  That's nuts.
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.120]  I would have bid him up.
[48:03.280 --> 48:03.840]  Great get.
[48:04.280 --> 48:05.180]  42, 41.
[48:05.300 --> 48:05.400]  Wow.
[48:05.480 --> 48:06.600]  You and I have essentially the same points.
[48:06.700 --> 48:06.860]  Yep.
[48:07.200 --> 48:09.560]  The next one is the bad guys, too.
[48:10.100 --> 48:10.660]  Oh, kids, maybe.
[48:11.520 --> 48:12.540]  I'll go five points.
[48:16.210 --> 48:16.910]  There you go.
[48:19.770 --> 48:20.170]  Jeff?
[48:21.750 --> 48:22.150]  Six.
[48:25.030 --> 48:25.430]  Seven.
[48:26.770 --> 48:27.710]  You can have it.
[48:29.170 --> 48:29.330]  Yeah.
[48:29.470 --> 48:29.870]  Wow.
[48:30.890 --> 48:32.490]  I don't think the first one did very well.
[48:33.350 --> 48:34.070]  Seven points.
[48:34.750 --> 48:35.770]  Enough for a sequel, I guess.
[48:35.790 --> 48:37.190]  Jeff, you have 41.
[48:37.290 --> 48:37.990]  Andrew has 35.
[48:38.350 --> 48:39.330]  Okay, 41, 35.
[48:40.050 --> 48:41.850]  Beneath the Storm has been cancelled, boys.
[48:42.250 --> 48:42.650]  But...
[48:42.650 --> 48:43.370]  It sure has.
[48:43.750 --> 48:45.110]  The Naked Gun is next.
[48:45.350 --> 48:46.490]  The Naked Gun.
[48:47.150 --> 48:48.370]  The reboot with Liam Neeson.
[48:49.130 --> 48:50.110]  I'll go three points.
[48:50.670 --> 48:51.630]  I'll go four points.
[48:52.330 --> 48:53.130]  Five points.
[48:54.050 --> 48:56.390]  This is probably the movie I'm most excited about on this whole list.
[48:56.510 --> 48:57.150]  Six points.
[48:57.190 --> 48:57.410]  Really?
[48:58.470 --> 48:58.930]  Seven points.
[48:58.930 --> 48:59.690]  I really want to see it.
[49:00.270 --> 49:00.750]  Me too.
[49:00.830 --> 49:02.150]  I thought the trailer looked fun.
[49:02.310 --> 49:02.990]  I'm excited.
[49:03.410 --> 49:05.310]  You're going seven points?
[49:05.310 --> 49:06.890]  Seven points.
[49:07.090 --> 49:07.950]  I'll go eight.
[49:08.570 --> 49:09.130]  Nine.
[49:09.810 --> 49:11.210]  All right, I'll go ten, fuck it.
[49:11.750 --> 49:12.110]  Eleven.
[49:13.590 --> 49:15.630]  Then you're going to see me say twelve.
[49:16.170 --> 49:16.710]  Thirteen.
[49:17.110 --> 49:18.490]  Then you'll see me say fourteen.
[49:18.990 --> 49:19.550]  Fifteen.
[49:21.450 --> 49:22.010]  Sixteen.
[49:24.250 --> 49:24.810]  Seventeen.
[49:25.630 --> 49:27.210]  So this is the last big thing?
[49:27.230 --> 49:28.050]  Easy, easy.
[49:28.250 --> 49:28.610]  Eighteen.
[49:29.250 --> 49:29.810]  Nineteen.
[49:29.890 --> 49:30.890]  What about Freakier Friday?
[49:31.650 --> 49:33.170]  I thought they already made that.
[49:33.710 --> 49:34.270]  Nineteen.
[49:34.270 --> 49:35.910]  Yeah, I could do twenty for Naked Gun.
[49:35.990 --> 49:36.310]  Why not?
[49:37.010 --> 49:37.630]  Twenty-one.
[49:38.210 --> 49:39.070]  You can have it.
[49:39.750 --> 49:41.530]  I'll take it for twenty-one points.
[49:42.130 --> 49:44.290]  I don't think it's worth twenty-one points.
[49:44.470 --> 49:44.950]  I don't either.
[49:45.710 --> 49:49.270]  I just want to bid you up for a little bit.
[49:49.710 --> 49:50.490]  Can we see the totals again?
[49:51.130 --> 49:52.770]  Yep, fourteen to forty-one.
[49:53.770 --> 49:55.290]  Jeff has forty-one.
[49:55.590 --> 49:56.850]  You got room to play, Jeff.
[49:57.090 --> 49:57.910]  Freakier Friday.
[49:58.810 --> 49:59.290]  One.
[49:59.870 --> 50:00.350]  Two.
[50:01.110 --> 50:02.090]  My wife's going to be stoked.
[50:02.730 --> 50:04.430]  I'll do three.
[50:05.210 --> 50:05.810]  Five.
[50:07.490 --> 50:08.090]  Six.
[50:08.990 --> 50:09.570]  Nine.
[50:12.270 --> 50:13.670]  I'll do ten.
[50:14.530 --> 50:15.030]  Eleven.
[50:19.530 --> 50:20.950]  Yeah, I can do twelve.
[50:21.130 --> 50:21.410]  Why not?
[50:22.330 --> 50:22.930]  Thirteen.
[50:25.910 --> 50:27.410]  It's up to you if you want it now.
[50:28.410 --> 50:28.990]  You know what?
[50:29.010 --> 50:29.450]  You can have it.
[50:29.450 --> 50:33.190]  I get Freakier Friday with thirteen points.
[50:33.390 --> 50:34.090]  Thirteen points.
[50:34.670 --> 50:37.950]  That leaves Andrew with one and Jeff with forty-one.
[50:37.990 --> 50:40.530]  All right, let's see how this plays out.
[50:40.850 --> 50:42.890]  You can just do everything and it's all yours, baby.
[50:43.290 --> 50:45.190]  Next film is one battle after another.
[50:45.330 --> 50:45.930]  One point.
[50:46.470 --> 50:46.690]  Two.
[50:46.930 --> 50:47.270]  One up there.
[50:47.610 --> 50:48.390]  Oh, shit!
[50:48.610 --> 50:49.990]  It goes to Jeff.
[50:50.310 --> 50:51.110]  Jeff got it.
[50:51.490 --> 50:52.070]  Two points.
[50:52.930 --> 50:53.530]  All right.
[50:53.870 --> 50:55.670]  I think Jeff's just going to win on sheer numbers.
[50:55.970 --> 50:56.750]  Click a...
[50:56.750 --> 50:58.010]  I'm going to go one, Jeff.
[50:58.170 --> 50:58.490]  Two.
[50:59.130 --> 50:59.610]  Fuck!
[50:59.970 --> 51:02.510]  Jeff with two wins it.
[51:04.210 --> 51:06.370]  Jeff, we got nobody two on the list.
[51:06.470 --> 51:07.730]  I'm going to put one on that.
[51:08.090 --> 51:08.550]  Five.
[51:09.010 --> 51:10.690]  God damn it!
[51:11.070 --> 51:12.110]  Him with five.
[51:12.270 --> 51:14.610]  Brings you down to thirty-two there, Jeff, so be wise.
[51:15.610 --> 51:20.110]  Jeff's got so many movies we can see them coming down the list from all the way down here.
[51:21.610 --> 51:22.090]  Americana.
[51:22.750 --> 51:23.590]  I'm going one.
[51:24.190 --> 51:25.370]  I'm going to go two.
[51:25.790 --> 51:26.250]  No!
[51:29.230 --> 51:32.530]  Jeff wins it with two in the last film.
[51:33.270 --> 51:34.170]  God-stealing.
[51:34.790 --> 51:35.550]  I'm going one.
[51:36.030 --> 51:36.130]  Two.
[51:37.310 --> 51:44.130]  Isn't that one battle after another, that movie with Leonardo DiCaprio that everybody's talking
[51:44.130 --> 51:44.270]  about?
[51:44.550 --> 51:44.970]  Yeah, OK, cool.
[51:45.050 --> 51:46.230]  Paul Thomas Anderson movie.
[51:46.470 --> 51:48.710]  Holy shit, that was some good stuff at the end.
[51:49.310 --> 51:50.710]  And Jeff, you've got twenty-eight bucks left.
[51:51.150 --> 51:51.610]  Yeah, you do.
[51:51.670 --> 51:55.170]  And Andrew has one, so we'll run it down.
[51:55.170 --> 52:00.310]  Andrew has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight movies here.
[52:00.950 --> 52:07.990]  One, two, three, four, five, six for Nick, seven for myself, four for Gavin.
[52:08.210 --> 52:14.690]  And Jeff has one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
[52:14.990 --> 52:16.910]  fourteen movies for Jeff.
[52:18.890 --> 52:19.930]  Holy cow.
[52:20.470 --> 52:24.530]  I came in with a plan and I got real caught up in the bidding and my plan went up the window.
[52:25.950 --> 52:29.430]  Now, caught up in the bidding, is that when you bid twelve and then you also bid thirteen?
[52:30.730 --> 52:32.470]  Yeah, and then what I bid for it?
[52:32.570 --> 52:35.870]  Well, the thing is, I got stuck with extra points last time and I was really annoyed
[52:35.870 --> 52:36.630]  about it the whole year.
[52:38.250 --> 52:41.510]  I went, maybe I need to split the difference between those two approaches.
[52:44.070 --> 52:45.670]  Well, we did it.
[52:45.810 --> 52:47.190]  Jeff has thirty dollars left over.
[52:47.270 --> 52:48.670]  And could that be the tiebreaker here?
[52:48.910 --> 52:50.970]  Very interested to see where everyone lands.
[52:51.530 --> 52:53.370]  We got some real steals in here.
[52:53.370 --> 52:55.750]  I have some stuff that maybe was overbid just a bit.
[52:55.870 --> 52:59.470]  But I think by and large, we're probably right on the money with where stuff is going to land.
[52:59.810 --> 53:02.530]  Once again, I'm so excited to see how this unfolds.
[53:02.570 --> 53:03.970]  Is Thunderbolts going to be big?
[53:04.350 --> 53:07.650]  Some of these movies probably will get pushed or at least one of them.
[53:08.010 --> 53:09.170]  Will we have another Horizon?
[53:09.450 --> 53:10.930]  Will Horizon get dated?
[53:11.250 --> 53:13.430]  That would be fucking crazy at this point.
[53:13.690 --> 53:14.290]  That'd be awesome.
[53:14.670 --> 53:16.230]  That would be insane.
[53:16.850 --> 53:20.410]  I feel like Nick's got to be... Nick, you got to be feeling pretty good right about now.
[53:20.750 --> 53:21.750]  Dude, I feel great.
[53:21.750 --> 53:23.450]  I got the ones I think are going to be blockbusters.
[53:23.590 --> 53:23.990]  So we'll see.
[53:24.290 --> 53:26.010]  Yeah, I think you're dead on with that.
[53:26.070 --> 53:27.110]  How to train your dragon, man.
[53:27.310 --> 53:29.330]  Yeah, yeah, they're definitely banking on it.
[53:29.610 --> 53:35.330]  I will say if you want to play this game yourself, a person in our community does amazing stuff.
[53:35.770 --> 53:36.490]  Regulationfan.com.
[53:36.650 --> 53:41.550]  They have a whole like template you can do so you could play with your friends this season.
[53:42.670 --> 53:43.390]  It's fantastic.
[53:43.830 --> 53:46.090]  And Nick, you got Mission Impossible for $29?
[53:46.650 --> 53:47.490]  Dude, that's a steal.
[53:47.670 --> 53:48.470]  That was a steal.
[53:48.890 --> 53:50.650]  Those movies make less than you would think.
[53:50.650 --> 53:52.270]  It's having it so early.
[53:52.430 --> 53:57.030]  I think when you see that and then down below it is how to train a dragon,
[53:57.430 --> 54:00.290]  Lilo and Stitch, Superman, Jurassic World.
[54:00.430 --> 54:02.070]  You're like, well, where am I spending my money?
[54:02.190 --> 54:02.950]  Like this is crazy.
[54:03.350 --> 54:03.990]  That's really hard.
[54:04.170 --> 54:04.990]  It's really, really hard.
[54:06.450 --> 54:08.730]  I'm really excited to see how this all turns out.
[54:09.010 --> 54:12.730]  I really liked it last week with like the week to week sort of like totals dating it.
[54:13.450 --> 54:14.970]  This is really exciting.
[54:15.130 --> 54:15.610]  This is great.
[54:15.790 --> 54:16.690]  I'm really, really pumped.
[54:16.690 --> 54:20.890]  I really hope people watch that turd Jurassic World movie.
[54:21.790 --> 54:23.590]  It's got Scarlett Johansson in it, right?
[54:23.690 --> 54:24.210]  It's going to be popular.
[54:25.030 --> 54:26.890]  I have a question for you guys.
[54:27.270 --> 54:27.690]  Yeah, of course.
[54:28.090 --> 54:29.010]  I don't think this has been covered.
[54:29.110 --> 54:30.190]  I don't know if we covered it last year.
[54:30.470 --> 54:32.290]  What does the winner get this year?
[54:32.630 --> 54:35.550]  I will reveal next time we record the podcast.
[54:35.850 --> 54:36.830]  I have a trophy.
[54:40.430 --> 54:41.730]  That's way better than my idea.
[54:42.190 --> 54:43.070]  That's so exciting.
[54:43.070 --> 54:51.030]  Um, well, remember, the dates of this are May 1st to September 22nd.
[54:51.390 --> 54:52.050]  That is it.
[54:52.330 --> 54:54.110]  That is a summer movie draft.
[54:54.430 --> 54:56.150]  Those are the dates, the beginning and the end.
[54:56.510 --> 55:01.010]  That's where money, domestic money, will be counted towards our totals.
[55:01.330 --> 55:03.050]  And I think that's it.
[55:03.190 --> 55:04.390]  Hey guys, how are you feeling?
[55:04.450 --> 55:05.010]  Anything else?
[55:05.410 --> 55:08.630]  I'm so excited to see just how it all plays out.
[55:08.790 --> 55:09.290]  I can't wait.
[55:09.370 --> 55:09.710]  Hell yeah.
[55:09.770 --> 55:11.370]  Thank you guys so much for doing this again this year.
[55:11.370 --> 55:15.770]  I cannot wait to, as I said, see how this all unfolds.
[55:16.770 --> 55:18.990]  Ballerina be the number one film of the summer.
[55:20.590 --> 55:22.970]  Clown in a cornfield is going to go off.
[55:23.130 --> 55:24.230]  Yeah, it's about to be crazy.
[55:24.310 --> 55:25.950]  Juliet and Romeo style, baby.
[55:26.730 --> 55:27.170]  Absolutely.
[55:27.630 --> 55:29.050]  Thank you so much for watching.
