[00:03.920 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,

[00:40.820 --> 00:44.360]  Hello and welcome to another regulation supplemental.
[00:44.520 --> 00:48.720]  We are breaking down our summer movie auction that we did.
[00:48.820 --> 00:53.140]  If you have not looked at that at all, go back and listen to that supplemental.
[00:53.620 --> 00:57.480]  And then come back here. It's over now. We're done. We finished it.
[00:57.480 --> 01:00.140]  Everyone bought movies. We did totals.
[01:00.480 --> 01:04.660]  And we are here to kind of reflect on the summer that was.
[01:04.840 --> 01:08.000]  How we feel about it. All that sort of good stuff.
[01:08.060 --> 01:10.060]  How do you guys feel about how things went?
[01:10.220 --> 01:11.260]  Because I liked it a lot.
[01:11.740 --> 01:12.340]  I feel medium.
[01:13.080 --> 01:16.160]  I don't know how I didn't catch up with you.
[01:16.280 --> 01:19.100]  I don't know how Alien didn't get me there.
[01:19.700 --> 01:22.020]  Uh, power Deadpool Wolverine.
[01:22.320 --> 01:25.400]  Can't stop Deadpool Wolverine for so long.
[01:25.820 --> 01:26.520]  Good lord.
[01:26.520 --> 01:27.700]  You wrote Inside Out too.
[01:27.820 --> 01:30.140]  I feel the same way about Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[01:30.560 --> 01:34.140]  But like, for some reason it didn't... nothing happened with it.
[01:34.260 --> 01:36.340]  Like, I don't know where like Crown Mania went.
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.620]  But like, it fell off.
[01:38.840 --> 01:39.660]  They just didn't know.
[01:40.500 --> 01:42.360]  I think all the Harold heads out there are like,
[01:42.420 --> 01:44.400]  when's that? Oh, it's out? It came out already?
[01:45.820 --> 01:49.080]  They're busy reading the books. They forgot there's a movie.
[01:49.320 --> 01:51.680]  Oh, we blew it. Oh, we blew it, Harold heads.
[01:51.740 --> 01:56.020]  Can you imagine walking out of Harold and the Purple Crayon and saying the book was better?
[01:56.820 --> 02:02.740]  Uh, no, I can't imagine walking out of Harold and the Purple Crayon at all.
[02:03.020 --> 02:04.400]  It's going to be Harold and the Purple Crayon day.
[02:04.460 --> 02:07.060]  I got some Harold and Purple Crayon on the podcast we record later.
[02:07.720 --> 02:11.900]  I'd love to know how much movie, uh, how much money that movie...
[02:11.900 --> 02:14.520]  What? How much money did it make?
[02:15.100 --> 02:16.460]  How much money did it make?
[02:16.980 --> 02:18.160]  How money make movie?
[02:18.380 --> 02:21.680]  Hey, do you want to have a look? Because here's like our actual draft and whatever.
[02:21.720 --> 02:24.400]  Oh yeah, so we're recording the screen if you want to visually watch this.
[02:24.800 --> 02:29.640]  But someone has put together a leaderboard here.
[02:29.900 --> 02:32.560]  For some reason, I'm in, I think it's in like reverse order.
[02:32.920 --> 02:34.060]  It's got a bug.
[02:34.620 --> 02:38.400]  Yeah, so, uh, here, Jeff, we can look at Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[02:40.440 --> 02:41.400]  17 million?
[02:41.820 --> 02:43.760]  Yeah, that's more than I would have guessed.
[02:44.120 --> 02:44.660]  A 17 million movie.
[02:44.840 --> 02:46.460]  A 17 million?
[02:46.960 --> 02:48.520]  Wow, that's great.
[02:49.080 --> 02:49.860]  What was his budget?
[02:49.960 --> 02:51.080]  Way more than Fabulous Four.
[02:54.530 --> 02:56.810]  More than Fabulous Four and Dee Dee together.
[02:56.990 --> 02:59.190]  Ooh, boy, more than Borderlands.
[02:59.470 --> 03:00.070]  Oh no.
[03:00.710 --> 03:01.630]  Oh wow.
[03:02.130 --> 03:03.090]  Oh my god.
[03:03.110 --> 03:03.830]  Oh my god.
[03:04.530 --> 03:06.130]  That's crazy to look at.
[03:06.310 --> 03:06.970]  That is...
[03:06.970 --> 03:07.050]  Wow.
[03:07.730 --> 03:08.210]  Wow.
[03:08.870 --> 03:10.910]  What did Untitled Horror end up being?
[03:11.990 --> 03:12.950]  Still Untitled.
[03:13.090 --> 03:13.290]  I think nothing.
[03:13.550 --> 03:14.070]  Yeah, okay.
[03:14.330 --> 03:14.970]  Never came out.
[03:15.130 --> 03:15.510]  Still don't know.
[03:16.090 --> 03:17.890]  And I got robbed of, uh, Horizon.
[03:17.970 --> 03:18.990]  What was Horizon part one?
[03:19.030 --> 03:19.630]  How much did that make?
[03:20.470 --> 03:21.410]  29 million.
[03:21.530 --> 03:22.350]  29 million.
[03:22.350 --> 03:23.530]  Wouldn't have been enough.
[03:24.330 --> 03:26.230]  All the Horizon homies forgot to show up.
[03:26.370 --> 03:26.850]  Unfortunately.
[03:27.230 --> 03:29.350]  Even that would have taken me ahead of Andrew.
[03:29.510 --> 03:30.310]  Look at the graph, Eric.
[03:30.590 --> 03:31.230]  How far off were you?
[03:31.290 --> 03:31.950]  Like 50 million?
[03:32.290 --> 03:32.850]  51 million?
[03:34.270 --> 03:35.470]  Look at the end there.
[03:35.890 --> 03:37.090]  Oh my god.
[03:37.190 --> 03:38.950]  Look at Andrew overtaking me.
[03:39.270 --> 03:44.890]  Then a little bit later, Alien came out and I just hovered perfectly underneath his line
[03:44.890 --> 03:46.850]  the entire way to the end.
[03:47.390 --> 03:51.210]  There was no week, there was no day where I made ground
[03:51.210 --> 03:52.970]  and he didn't make the same ground.
[03:53.530 --> 03:54.750]  That is insane.
[03:55.110 --> 03:56.390]  Was I ever in first?
[03:59.070 --> 03:59.910]  Maybe on...
[03:59.910 --> 03:59.950]  No.
[04:00.550 --> 04:01.370]  Maybe flunk it out.
[04:01.750 --> 04:02.090]  No.
[04:02.330 --> 04:05.970]  God, that first week or so was real sweet to Jeff.
[04:06.130 --> 04:06.970]  Felt real good.
[04:07.790 --> 04:08.630]  There you were.
[04:08.970 --> 04:09.610]  What a day.
[04:10.990 --> 04:13.290]  June 2nd, a day that will... and the 3rd.
[04:13.750 --> 04:14.970]  Oh my gosh, the 4th.
[04:15.110 --> 04:15.730]  Oh, you had to run.
[04:16.230 --> 04:18.630]  Oh my god, a week that will live in infamy.
[04:18.710 --> 04:19.910]  Oh my god.
[04:19.910 --> 04:21.510]  And then, and then, check it out.
[04:21.730 --> 04:21.790]  You and Jeff.
[04:22.830 --> 04:24.930]  Oh my god.
[04:25.230 --> 04:25.670]  Inside Out, baby.
[04:25.670 --> 04:28.430]  It's a $50 million swing instantly.
[04:28.570 --> 04:30.510]  Holy shit, look at that.
[04:31.330 --> 04:32.470]  Almost $100 million.
[04:33.310 --> 04:37.290]  So Inside Out 2 and Deadpool and Wolverine ended up being
[04:37.290 --> 04:41.010]  respectively the most successful films in their genre ever, right?
[04:42.450 --> 04:44.550]  Yeah, I would say so for like the R-rated.
[04:44.810 --> 04:49.370]  Is there a higher, more financially successful R-rated movie?
[04:49.370 --> 04:51.490]  I don't think so, I don't believe there is.
[04:52.090 --> 04:53.530]  Sure as shit wasn't Showgirls.
[04:55.950 --> 04:59.710]  Now, I think that we have all had a lot to say so far,
[04:59.790 --> 05:01.290]  but Nick has been like weirdly quiet.
[05:02.190 --> 05:04.470]  I spent a lot of money for not a lot of Pam.
[05:05.950 --> 05:10.250]  We really thought, like you, like, look at this, Nick, look at this run.
[05:10.970 --> 05:11.990]  I, I, listen.
[05:12.790 --> 05:15.850]  Second place, second place, second place, second place, second place.
[05:16.870 --> 05:18.210]  Eating fucking dust.
[05:18.210 --> 05:20.210]  And then Jeff did it right at the end.
[05:20.610 --> 05:24.550]  And then I Beetlejuiced him.
[05:25.070 --> 05:27.930]  I felt bad because my line's pretty horizontal.
[05:28.550 --> 05:30.410]  Like, I got like a bump here, whatever.
[05:30.670 --> 05:32.090]  Mine's pretty low the whole way.
[05:32.630 --> 05:34.830]  Nick, what happened?
[05:35.010 --> 05:36.050]  It's such a good start.
[05:36.650 --> 05:38.650]  You just stopped drafting movies?
[05:40.370 --> 05:41.270]  It's interesting.
[05:41.590 --> 05:43.650]  The studio, it just ran out of money.
[05:43.910 --> 05:44.730]  I don't know what happened.
[05:45.530 --> 05:48.950]  Yeah, let's go back to the, to the Excel sheet.
[05:49.610 --> 05:51.950]  Well, we can have a look at what everyone drafted here.
[05:51.990 --> 05:52.370]  All right.
[05:54.970 --> 05:56.270]  Despicable Me 4.
[05:56.730 --> 05:58.350]  Really put it all on Despicable Me.
[05:58.650 --> 06:03.950]  There is a alternate reality where Nick lets me get it at 79 points and our
[06:03.950 --> 06:05.510]  things are flipped completely.
[06:06.050 --> 06:06.490]  Yep.
[06:07.210 --> 06:12.690]  I think I was so burned out on recent MCU that I didn't even care about Deadpool
[06:12.690 --> 06:14.170]  Wolframe when we were doing this.
[06:14.530 --> 06:17.390]  And then as it came up, the hype was insane.
[06:17.530 --> 06:18.510]  And then the movie was good.
[06:18.590 --> 06:20.990]  I was like, wow, they fixed it.
[06:21.650 --> 06:24.350]  Dude, I watched Bad Boys Ride or Die on the plane.
[06:25.290 --> 06:28.890]  That was a great, there's some cool moments, but like...
[06:28.890 --> 06:29.930]  Oh, I liked it a lot.
[06:30.290 --> 06:31.170]  I haven't seen it yet.
[06:31.290 --> 06:32.450]  I was totally fine with it.
[06:32.690 --> 06:33.970]  It's, you watch it.
[06:34.070 --> 06:34.890]  Well, here's the problem.
[06:34.990 --> 06:38.670]  I watched Bad Boys 2, then Bad Boys 1, and then Bad Boys Ride or Die.
[06:38.770 --> 06:41.910]  And I went, well, this is not a Michael Bay movie at all.
[06:41.910 --> 06:42.710]  Like, not even close.
[06:42.710 --> 06:43.070]  Is that your favorite?
[06:43.190 --> 06:46.090]  Yeah, I do like that he's in them, though.
[06:46.370 --> 06:48.330]  Like, as a little, like, not like approval.
[06:48.550 --> 06:51.030]  Like, they bring him in for both the last two.
[06:51.230 --> 06:53.030]  Oh, yeah, he did have a cameo in four.
[06:53.530 --> 06:53.730]  Yep.
[06:54.270 --> 06:57.690]  I'm pleased that with less points than Nick's single movie,
[06:57.730 --> 07:00.190]  I managed to get three nine-figure movies, though.
[07:02.150 --> 07:04.830]  So what was the difference between Gavin and I?
[07:05.470 --> 07:07.350]  Because I came in first, Gavin was second.
[07:09.210 --> 07:10.090]  I guess...
[07:10.090 --> 07:12.210]  That would be on the top leaderboard, I would say.
[07:13.290 --> 07:14.470]  Where am I looking here?
[07:14.650 --> 07:15.690]  No, it's just the top numbers.
[07:15.830 --> 07:18.890]  So, billion, 30, and then 981.
[07:19.330 --> 07:20.230]  So, like, 19.
[07:20.550 --> 07:21.350]  About 50 million.
[07:23.210 --> 07:23.950]  It's crazy.
[07:24.330 --> 07:26.110]  Just under, like, 49 million.
[07:26.530 --> 07:28.770]  The 15 bucks I was saving didn't come into play, really.
[07:28.870 --> 07:30.850]  I thought maybe, I thought it would.
[07:31.070 --> 07:32.230]  I felt like mine was going...
[07:32.230 --> 07:33.970]  I got nine bucks sitting in my pocket.
[07:34.250 --> 07:35.670]  And then, I don't know, man.
[07:36.550 --> 07:38.270]  Why is Janet Planet right?
[07:38.270 --> 07:41.150]  During the auction, the points of this movie were not recorded correctly,
[07:41.150 --> 07:42.310]  instead of inputting them.
[07:42.390 --> 07:42.810]  Oh, okay.
[07:43.090 --> 07:44.390]  Wait, so you got a free movie?
[07:45.230 --> 07:48.790]  Yeah, but it made me less than one million dollars.
[07:49.310 --> 07:52.770]  Look, I want to say, even though you came in fifth, I think that's a DQ.
[07:53.270 --> 07:54.010]  What? No way!
[07:54.010 --> 07:54.670]  I think you're disqualified.
[07:55.110 --> 07:55.770]  No, you know what?
[07:56.150 --> 07:59.190]  We can't have, like, your studio couldn't have got that movie.
[07:59.470 --> 07:59.990]  What do you mean?
[08:00.670 --> 08:01.470]  Alright, here.
[08:01.750 --> 08:03.090]  Hey, Gavin, you know what?
[08:03.170 --> 08:05.230]  You can take one million dollars away.
[08:05.390 --> 08:07.450]  That's even more than this movie made.
[08:07.450 --> 08:11.190]  You can take one million dollars away from me, and we'll see where that puts me.
[08:11.230 --> 08:14.130]  If it was the last movie you drafted, I would say that would work.
[08:14.570 --> 08:16.490]  But because it happened early, I don't know.
[08:16.630 --> 08:17.210]  I think that's a DQ.
[08:18.350 --> 08:18.750]  No?
[08:19.330 --> 08:20.490]  That's what I like about Texas.
[08:21.030 --> 08:24.230]  Is there a way that Gavin could have won with those 15 points?
[08:24.350 --> 08:24.870]  Thanks, Nick.
[08:25.930 --> 08:26.410]  I liked it.
[08:26.450 --> 08:26.930]  With the what?
[08:27.330 --> 08:29.450]  With the 15 points he had left.
[08:29.550 --> 08:30.270]  Fifteen dollars.
[08:31.230 --> 08:32.190]  Look at the movies.
[08:33.110 --> 08:34.370]  Look, go back to where all the movies were.
[08:34.370 --> 08:37.690]  I wonder if there's a way that Gavin could have won.
[08:37.870 --> 08:38.370]  Well, yeah.
[08:38.410 --> 08:43.410]  If he didn't put it on Horizon Zero Dawn Part 2 or whatever, right?
[08:45.230 --> 08:49.010]  Like, if he would have saved a point there, because there's what?
[08:49.150 --> 08:50.810]  There's one, two, three here.
[08:51.130 --> 08:51.890]  Look what I've got there.
[08:52.630 --> 08:54.710]  Yeah, could you go back to the board?
[08:55.030 --> 08:55.570]  The other thing?
[08:55.790 --> 08:56.290]  Oh, he could have got Beetle.
[08:56.330 --> 08:57.870]  He could have probably gone for Beetlejuice.
[08:58.150 --> 08:58.690]  Let's see how much.
[08:58.870 --> 09:02.230]  Like, let's just look at the movies and what they went for in the
[09:02.230 --> 09:05.230]  the community made website.
[09:06.130 --> 09:08.730]  I remember going for Beetlejuice, but I didn't have enough money.
[09:09.250 --> 09:11.790]  So let's open up Jeff or yeah, that works.
[09:11.930 --> 09:13.570]  I think I got it for not too much money.
[09:13.670 --> 09:14.110]  It was at the end.
[09:14.330 --> 09:15.410]  It should be at the very bottom.
[09:15.910 --> 09:16.270]  Beetlejuice.
[09:16.410 --> 09:19.670]  So do you want to see it by points or you just want to see it by release date?
[09:20.190 --> 09:20.650]  Release date.
[09:20.750 --> 09:21.490]  Scroll down, Beetlejuice.
[09:21.690 --> 09:22.290]  Sixteen points.
[09:22.490 --> 09:23.390]  One more than I had.
[09:24.370 --> 09:24.950]  One more.
[09:25.490 --> 09:27.750]  I think it was 16 because I was going to put 15.
[09:29.290 --> 09:29.650]  Wow.
[09:29.790 --> 09:30.370]  I see.
[09:30.630 --> 09:30.950]  Okay.
[09:30.950 --> 09:33.830]  So I really screwed myself with Horizon then.
[09:34.230 --> 09:34.350]  Yeah.
[09:34.710 --> 09:35.110]  Wow.
[09:35.390 --> 09:36.490]  Because I would have had.
[09:37.370 --> 09:38.250]  Dang, look at that.
[09:38.250 --> 09:41.090]  I would have had 21 points.
[09:41.550 --> 09:43.630]  So did Jeff have more than that still there?
[09:44.150 --> 09:44.930]  What about Trap?
[09:45.690 --> 09:46.590]  I did it.
[09:46.870 --> 09:49.410]  Ends with us three points for 148 million.
[09:49.810 --> 09:50.350]  That's pretty good.
[09:50.890 --> 09:51.570]  Wait, that's you?
[09:52.090 --> 09:52.490]  Yeah.
[09:52.930 --> 09:54.050]  You did it ends with us?
[09:54.150 --> 09:57.710]  Well, it says that during the auction, the points of this movie were not recorded correctly.
[09:57.970 --> 10:00.750]  Instead of setting the point value to zero, we have the intended value.
[10:00.750 --> 10:01.950]  Does that mean Jeff is disqualified?
[10:02.890 --> 10:03.050]  Wait.
[10:03.330 --> 10:04.110]  I'm afraid so.
[10:04.190 --> 10:04.570]  I guess so.
[10:04.630 --> 10:04.730]  Okay.
[10:05.050 --> 10:05.630]  Just making sure.
[10:06.450 --> 10:07.830]  Yeah, I guess Eric and I are both disqualified.
[10:08.070 --> 10:08.370]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:08.410 --> 10:09.070]  Me and Jeff are disqualified.
[10:09.390 --> 10:11.550]  Or I get an extra 148 million is what it's saying.
[10:13.530 --> 10:17.510]  But wait, how many points did you have left at the Beetlejuice mock?
[10:19.250 --> 10:22.750]  I ended up having eight left after I bought it, I think.
[10:22.870 --> 10:22.970]  Oh, okay.
[10:23.130 --> 10:23.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[10:23.590 --> 10:23.890]  So, yeah.
[10:24.090 --> 10:24.270]  So, you still would have had...
[10:24.270 --> 10:24.930]  I didn't spend all my points.
[10:25.190 --> 10:26.590]  No, Jeff, you had four left at the end.
[10:26.590 --> 10:26.750]  Four left.
[10:26.750 --> 10:27.510]  So you had 20 points.
[10:27.690 --> 10:28.790]  Looks like you had 20 points total.
[10:30.090 --> 10:32.330]  Wait, so that changes everything, doesn't it?
[10:33.030 --> 10:33.870]  Why is that?
[10:34.750 --> 10:35.550]  What do you mean?
[10:35.770 --> 10:37.510]  Articulate how it changes anything.
[10:39.730 --> 10:43.290]  You can't just say that changes everything and then wait for everybody to agree.
[10:45.450 --> 10:50.990]  Well, I think what would have made a bigger change is if you bought Trap,
[10:51.570 --> 10:55.010]  which is three points, you probably could have got it for four or five.
[10:55.390 --> 10:55.610]  Yeah.
[10:55.870 --> 10:57.390]  And that's 42 million.
[10:58.630 --> 11:00.030]  That was a huge hit.
[11:00.730 --> 11:06.410]  With Jeff and Eric getting free movies and my movie absorbing six points didn't come out.
[11:07.690 --> 11:08.090]  Damn.
[11:08.690 --> 11:09.890]  I feel like I could have had this.
[11:11.170 --> 11:13.570]  Oh, you're close. You had it for most of the summer.
[11:14.070 --> 11:16.250]  So did we find out if it changed everything or not?
[11:16.330 --> 11:17.610]  I still don't know if it changed anything.
[11:17.610 --> 11:18.750]  I don't think it changed anything.
[11:18.990 --> 11:20.050]  I'm just making sure. Thank you.
[11:23.910 --> 11:25.790]  Most people thought you were going to win this, Gavin.
[11:25.790 --> 11:28.870]  He still would have been up to outbid me by a couple of points, but
[11:30.250 --> 11:35.570]  if I didn't lose Horizon, it would have changed everything.
[11:37.830 --> 11:39.770]  He keeps saying it.
[11:40.390 --> 11:43.830]  Basically, if one variable changes, it changes everything.
[11:45.610 --> 11:46.590]  That's how life works.
[11:47.270 --> 11:48.830]  I mean, I suppose.
[11:49.730 --> 11:50.590]  Sliding doors.
[11:52.690 --> 11:54.550]  You're a real Gwyneth Paltrow, Gavin.
[11:56.030 --> 11:58.190]  So with Jeff's, it ends with us.
[11:58.290 --> 12:00.590]  That's definitely the most money per point.
[12:01.650 --> 12:03.950]  I would think so. That's got to be pretty good.
[12:04.650 --> 12:05.330]  That's real good.
[12:05.370 --> 12:07.830]  I was like 60. Is that what the column on the right is?
[12:07.910 --> 12:09.290]  50 million a point.
[12:09.910 --> 12:12.410]  So yeah, 148 million is how much it made.
[12:12.710 --> 12:14.730]  And Jeff spent three points on it.
[12:15.070 --> 12:16.710]  So 49 million per point.
[12:16.950 --> 12:17.270]  Yeah.
[12:17.450 --> 12:19.210]  So the best value of any movie.
[12:19.630 --> 12:20.270]  That's crazy.
[12:21.230 --> 12:22.230]  What was Wolverine's value?
[12:22.910 --> 12:23.910]  Had to be pretty good.
[12:24.130 --> 12:24.830]  What do you mean value?
[12:24.830 --> 12:26.670]  Like point to money.
[12:27.170 --> 12:28.170]  It's 9 million.
[12:28.710 --> 12:29.310]  9 million.
[12:30.050 --> 12:31.110]  9.292 million.
[12:31.510 --> 12:33.010]  And Inside Out 2 is 14 million.
[12:33.050 --> 12:35.850]  Harold and the Purple Crayon was 5 million a point.
[12:35.990 --> 12:38.010]  Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talking about.
[12:38.490 --> 12:41.650]  So Twisters, and it ends with us, were phenomenal value per point.
[12:42.190 --> 12:42.410]  Yeah.
[12:42.530 --> 12:42.850]  Yeah.
[12:43.270 --> 12:44.610]  Oh, they got it for me, for sure.
[12:46.170 --> 12:49.870]  The Watchers, do you want to just go through everyone's list and maybe we each talk about
[12:49.870 --> 12:51.750]  how we felt about these doors?
[12:51.750 --> 12:52.810]  Let's start from the bottom.
[12:53.190 --> 12:55.370]  Uh, The Strangers.
[12:55.770 --> 12:56.330]  Heard it sucked.
[12:57.030 --> 12:57.470]  Furiosa.
[12:57.830 --> 12:58.710]  I'm disappointed.
[12:59.090 --> 13:03.010]  I thought that, like, all I heard is that, like, this was a box office flop and looking
[13:03.010 --> 13:05.510]  at 67 million dollars, that's pretty awesome.
[13:06.110 --> 13:08.310]  Should have been well over 100, I would think.
[13:08.590 --> 13:09.030]  Right?
[13:10.070 --> 13:10.710]  I could guess.
[13:12.170 --> 13:13.490]  I just don't, like, it's weird.
[13:13.590 --> 13:15.350]  That movie came and went so quick.
[13:15.850 --> 13:16.190]  Yeah.
[13:16.590 --> 13:18.530]  And there's no discussion.
[13:19.190 --> 13:22.530]  And the same way that the last Mad Max, it felt like it floated and you're seeing
[13:22.530 --> 13:26.070]  posts about it and memes and, like, just none of that for this.
[13:26.130 --> 13:27.630]  It just had nothing on Fury Road.
[13:28.130 --> 13:29.350]  Yeah, I agree.
[13:29.530 --> 13:29.870]  I agree.
[13:30.050 --> 13:32.330]  And then, uh, here's an anime thing.
[13:32.470 --> 13:33.310]  Here's Janet Planet.
[13:33.670 --> 13:34.150]  Maxine.
[13:34.430 --> 13:35.850]  I didn't expect that to do.
[13:36.150 --> 13:37.630]  I mean, 15 million is pretty great.
[13:37.670 --> 13:38.070]  Not bad.
[13:38.130 --> 13:38.350]  For that.
[13:38.750 --> 13:40.510]  I'm just glad they're done making those movies.
[13:40.590 --> 13:41.110]  That's pretty great.
[13:41.350 --> 13:45.670]  Is Janet Planet the worst point to money value on the entire list?
[13:46.110 --> 13:46.930]  Might be.
[13:47.010 --> 13:47.810]  It might be.
[13:48.890 --> 13:50.070]  The crow would like a word.
[13:50.650 --> 13:51.910]  No, not the crow!
[13:53.430 --> 13:54.790]  396 for Janet Planet.
[13:54.950 --> 13:55.470]  Let's have a look.
[13:55.550 --> 13:55.730]  Hang on.
[13:55.810 --> 13:56.190]  We're scrolling.
[13:56.470 --> 13:57.970]  102 for Ryan's World.
[13:58.570 --> 13:58.950]  Sorry.
[13:59.370 --> 14:01.670]  Oh, 100 grand per point.
[14:01.770 --> 14:03.770]  Yeah, it's, it's, uh, yep.
[14:03.810 --> 14:04.410]  It's Ryan's World.
[14:04.490 --> 14:05.230]  That's expensive.
[14:05.810 --> 14:05.950]  Yep.
[14:07.130 --> 14:08.250]  Didi Megadudu.
[14:08.530 --> 14:11.490]  Harold and the Purple Crayon didn't, didn't pull for me.
[14:11.810 --> 14:12.750]  Herald Heads didn't come through.
[14:13.190 --> 14:15.030]  Borderlands making less money.
[14:15.290 --> 14:19.250]  That's, like, 11 points here is crazy.
[14:19.250 --> 14:22.630]  Like, in retrospect, we knew it wasn't going to do well.
[14:23.230 --> 14:25.750]  I figured it was going to do more than that.
[14:25.930 --> 14:31.350]  It was going to be like a $48 million flop, not a $15 million flop.
[14:31.430 --> 14:34.070]  It made less overall than I thought it would do opening weekend.
[14:34.410 --> 14:35.290]  Yes, me too.
[14:35.490 --> 14:42.410]  I think what happened, this is just speculation, I think that Borderlands came out at a time
[14:42.410 --> 14:46.830]  where there were too many other meme-y little shitty movies.
[14:47.270 --> 14:49.370]  So you couldn't grab onto it.
[14:49.470 --> 14:52.690]  You're riding the wave of Deadpool and Wolverine, which was, like, dominating the conversation.
[14:53.190 --> 14:56.410]  Harold and the Purple Crayon was the one that people memed.
[14:56.970 --> 14:58.910]  And it did, and it helped it get to 17.
[14:59.270 --> 15:00.550]  Nobody memed Borderlands.
[15:01.010 --> 15:05.670]  Like, it did not grab and push at all, which is really, really tough.
[15:06.810 --> 15:08.470]  Trap, I saw, I helped it out.
[15:08.570 --> 15:10.550]  I thought it was very, for three points, banger.
[15:10.910 --> 15:11.650]  Oh, pretty great.
[15:11.650 --> 15:13.250]  That's a pretty good return, man.
[15:13.470 --> 15:18.590]  The Crow, I think I was just trying to get rid of points at this point.
[15:19.050 --> 15:22.390]  You were, it was, you guys were running out of movies and had points left.
[15:22.590 --> 15:25.170]  So it created inflated value on these.
[15:25.630 --> 15:27.290]  You spent 23 points on it.
[15:28.030 --> 15:31.930]  The Crow, doing under $10 million, makes sense if you see The Crow.
[15:32.150 --> 15:35.130]  Like, if you watch this movie, you'd just be like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:35.170 --> 15:38.110]  More people wanted to watch Ronald Reagan than The Crow.
[15:40.590 --> 15:43.050]  Well, this is definitely an AstroTurf thing.
[15:43.130 --> 15:48.310]  This is a thing where, like, weird, like, voting packs are like,
[15:48.370 --> 15:50.630]  we're going to buy all the tickets, but no one's going to go.
[15:50.770 --> 15:52.170]  I think that's what happened here for Reagan.
[15:52.330 --> 15:53.990]  So that's tough, but that's mine.
[15:54.190 --> 15:55.730]  You know, it is what it is.
[15:56.710 --> 15:57.710]  Nick, let's have a look at yours.
[15:57.750 --> 15:58.190]  What do you think?
[15:58.310 --> 15:59.570]  Oh my God, that's all you got?
[16:00.290 --> 16:05.170]  Yeah, it was a lot of not foresight and a lot of upfront spending.
[16:05.370 --> 16:07.330]  Nick, this is all within a month and a half.
[16:08.990 --> 16:12.770]  This is like, this is all within 40 days.
[16:13.190 --> 16:14.790]  I was at the table.
[16:15.170 --> 16:16.050]  I said, let it ride.
[16:16.130 --> 16:17.190]  And I kept saying it.
[16:17.410 --> 16:18.410]  And I kept saying it.
[16:18.450 --> 16:20.750]  And before you know it, I woke up with no money.
[16:23.910 --> 16:26.370]  Back to black costing the same amount of trap.
[16:26.770 --> 16:28.350]  Yeah, oh, that's very funny.
[16:28.730 --> 16:28.990]  Yeah.
[16:29.570 --> 16:33.030]  I was taking some low gambles at first and then just jumped full on in.
[16:33.150 --> 16:33.350]  Yeah.
[16:36.010 --> 16:37.110]  Rough trade, bud.
[16:37.350 --> 16:37.670]  Sorry.
[16:37.670 --> 16:39.450]  I should have let Andrew go.
[16:39.590 --> 16:40.410]  Yeah, you should have.
[16:40.590 --> 16:44.430]  So going through it, Nick spent three points back to black, got six million for it.
[16:45.150 --> 16:48.930]  Then sight, two points, and he got seven million.
[16:50.110 --> 16:52.310]  Followed by blue, some anime thing.
[16:52.710 --> 16:54.310]  One point, 1.8 million.
[16:55.450 --> 16:56.750]  A quiet place day one.
[16:57.210 --> 16:57.830]  Goodbye, Nick.
[16:58.070 --> 17:00.050]  10 points, 138 million.
[17:00.750 --> 17:02.070]  Can't believe that many people saw it.
[17:02.110 --> 17:02.510]  That's nuts.
[17:02.710 --> 17:03.650]  It was really good.
[17:04.010 --> 17:04.970]  I didn't see it in theaters.
[17:05.130 --> 17:06.610]  I watched it when it came out on VOD.
[17:06.610 --> 17:07.890]  But I really enjoyed it.
[17:07.930 --> 17:12.310]  Like, I'm not a huge Quiet Place fan, but I thought that was the best one by far.
[17:12.610 --> 17:12.990]  It was really good.
[17:13.770 --> 17:19.970]  And then Despicable Me 4, 360 million is what it earned and spent 80 points on it.
[17:20.190 --> 17:22.890]  You and I were going back and forth for Despicable Me.
[17:23.070 --> 17:24.410]  That one got really out of hand.
[17:24.790 --> 17:28.430]  But it did, but also look at the domestic point.
[17:29.290 --> 17:31.530]  Like, how much it made to point total?
[17:31.970 --> 17:33.270]  Only four and a half.
[17:33.910 --> 17:37.090]  Like, are you happy to have missed out on that one, Andrew?
[17:37.350 --> 17:38.310]  Oh, I'm so happy.
[17:38.550 --> 17:39.390]  Yeah, because I'm Nick.
[17:39.670 --> 17:40.990]  If that doesn't...
[17:40.990 --> 17:44.670]  Yeah, if that goes forward, I'm Nick and Nick has Deadpool Wolverine.
[17:45.330 --> 17:46.670]  And I am Nick and this sucks.
[17:50.870 --> 17:52.170]  Hey, it's Paris.
[17:52.650 --> 17:54.830]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[17:55.050 --> 17:55.870]  Like stars.
[17:56.330 --> 17:56.570]  Duh.
[17:57.070 --> 18:00.710]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[18:00.710 --> 18:05.630]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[18:05.810 --> 18:10.330]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[18:11.010 --> 18:13.370]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[18:13.890 --> 18:14.590]  That's hot.

[18:21.150 --> 18:25.310]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[18:25.730 --> 18:28.370]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity.
[18:28.370 --> 18:32.170]  Plus, it's heated and it just feels so good.
[18:33.410 --> 18:37.850]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[18:39.450 --> 18:41.450]  suddenly it seems quite practical.
[18:42.090 --> 18:44.590]  The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[18:44.930 --> 18:48.210]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats.
[18:48.550 --> 18:50.090]  It only feels extravagant.

[19:16.750 --> 19:17.910]  Let's have a look at Jeff here.
[19:18.790 --> 19:24.270]  Mine can be pretty quick. I take a bit of a scattershot approach.
[19:24.270 --> 19:25.910]  Sort of a shotgun approach, if you will.
[19:27.270 --> 19:30.630]  Clearly, I had a big, big win in IF at over $10 million a point.
[19:30.670 --> 19:30.910]  Yeah, really?
[19:31.410 --> 19:32.630]  I knew that was going to do well for me.
[19:33.670 --> 19:36.130]  It ends with us, a surprise hit of the summer.
[19:36.270 --> 19:36.910]  I had an idea.
[19:37.110 --> 19:40.930]  My wife has a book talk podcast with Eric's wife.
[19:41.290 --> 19:42.290]  So I, you know...
[19:42.290 --> 19:42.730]  That was good.
[19:42.890 --> 19:48.110]  I have my ear to the ground, as it were, you know, about as to what's popular in book talk.
[19:48.550 --> 19:51.930]  It's called Clutch My Pearls and you can listen to it wherever you get podcasts.
[19:52.450 --> 19:53.030]  There you go.
[19:53.030 --> 19:54.730]  I was trying to be a little more subtle.
[19:54.970 --> 20:00.410]  Beetlejuice obviously pulled me up at the end to climb the Nick hump,
[20:00.630 --> 20:01.890]  which I was glad to get ahead of.
[20:02.850 --> 20:05.970]  Real disappointed in fucking Kevin Costner.
[20:06.370 --> 20:07.850]  That's my takeaway from the summer.
[20:08.450 --> 20:08.990]  You're disappointed.
[20:09.290 --> 20:10.030]  Really let me down.
[20:10.150 --> 20:10.790]  How do you think he feels?
[20:13.290 --> 20:16.230]  There was... during the... when we did this,
[20:16.410 --> 20:20.710]  I thought it was hilarious that you bought the first and showed zero interest in the second.
[20:20.710 --> 20:27.110]  And what a great fucking vision you had of how that thing would play out.
[20:27.190 --> 20:28.910]  Spent too much on the first.
[20:29.270 --> 20:32.550]  But man, did you call the drop off between...
[20:34.710 --> 20:36.230]  And just crazy.
[20:36.790 --> 20:37.610]  Trying to thread a needle.
[20:38.270 --> 20:40.410]  Looking at just movies, the bike riders.
[20:41.230 --> 20:41.790]  What was that?
[20:41.850 --> 20:43.710]  Four points for 21 million?
[20:44.070 --> 20:45.970]  I don't think I know anyone who has seen that movie.
[20:46.050 --> 20:46.930]  I forgot it exists.
[20:47.110 --> 20:49.410]  It's a movie I forget about constantly.
[20:50.030 --> 20:53.910]  I think it's because Tom Hardy has a bad accent in it or something.
[20:54.150 --> 20:55.390]  Yeah, he does. That's great.
[20:55.910 --> 21:01.130]  Well, we were thinking that Ryan's world, the movie was the worst point to money value.
[21:01.690 --> 21:06.450]  But I did spend six points on zero dollars because of Kevin Costner.
[21:06.630 --> 21:08.070]  Oh, that is true.
[21:09.770 --> 21:10.290]  Tough.
[21:10.390 --> 21:10.590]  Yeah.
[21:11.230 --> 21:11.510]  Yeah.
[21:11.770 --> 21:16.310]  So point value being one sixth of nothing per dollar spent.
[21:17.870 --> 21:19.130]  Jeff, anything else here?
[21:19.790 --> 21:21.350]  Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice doing it.
[21:21.630 --> 21:22.250]  Pretty good stuff.
[21:22.750 --> 21:26.930]  Yeah, you know, clearly, I wish it would have come out a little earlier in the summer,
[21:26.930 --> 21:29.530]  but I knew I was taking a risk getting it at the end of the year.
[21:29.630 --> 21:33.170]  And like I said, I'm just glad it was there to help me climb Nick.
[21:33.650 --> 21:36.490]  How many of these movies have you seen, Jeff, that you have?
[21:36.630 --> 21:39.530]  Uh, I have seen on my list...
[21:41.890 --> 21:42.250]  If.
[21:44.110 --> 21:46.930]  So you started it out, you went to the first one.
[21:47.190 --> 21:48.370]  You didn't even see Beetlejuice?
[21:48.990 --> 21:50.250]  Millie and I saw If.
[21:50.570 --> 21:53.930]  No, I saw a lot of movies on other people's lists, but that's the only one I saw from mine.
[21:53.990 --> 21:54.410]  Thanks, man.
[21:55.650 --> 21:59.530]  I have a question. How did how did some movies on this list not come out?
[21:59.570 --> 22:01.810]  And then there were some movies that came out that weren't on this list.
[22:02.130 --> 22:02.650]  A good question.
[22:02.890 --> 22:03.270]  What do you mean?
[22:03.650 --> 22:05.270]  Wasn't there a Transformers movie that came out?
[22:05.710 --> 22:13.570]  Yeah, so typically we would cut this off at the end of August, but we did this like a week later.
[22:14.030 --> 22:14.210]  Yeah.
[22:14.210 --> 22:16.830]  So it went one week longer.
[22:17.030 --> 22:19.930]  So it was the first week of September was the cutoff.
[22:20.190 --> 22:24.170]  What about the Nicolas Cage horror movie that came out that made a bunch of money?
[22:24.670 --> 22:25.150]  Long Legs?
[22:25.290 --> 22:28.870]  Yeah, that just may have just slipped under the radar for the list that I was using.
[22:29.990 --> 22:32.370]  Seems like that could have been my untitled horror film I bought.
[22:33.730 --> 22:35.470]  David Chase's Long Legs?
[22:38.330 --> 22:39.390]  Is this Pauly?
[22:40.130 --> 22:41.170]  Pauly on stilts?
[22:41.390 --> 22:42.830]  Gavin, you ready to move on to your list?
[22:42.830 --> 22:44.690]  Just shy of a billion.
[22:44.870 --> 22:45.170]  Wow.
[22:46.310 --> 22:47.090]  Here it is.
[22:47.230 --> 22:48.050]  Wow, not a lot.
[22:50.410 --> 22:50.970]  Not a lot.
[22:53.590 --> 22:54.770]  All right, good insight.
[22:54.930 --> 22:57.850]  City of Tree? I don't even remember. Did I really have those?
[22:58.170 --> 23:03.350]  So Gavin opened with Bad Boys Ride or Die for 12 points, made $193 million domestic.
[23:03.730 --> 23:07.490]  I really liked it. I know you watched it in a way we already kind of covered it, Eric.
[23:07.590 --> 23:10.710]  It wasn't your favorite. I think outside of Bad Boys, do my favorite Bad Boys.
[23:10.810 --> 23:11.650]  I think it's better than one.
[23:12.210 --> 23:13.310]  It's more enjoyable.
[23:16.490 --> 23:17.510]  Inside Out 2?
[23:18.690 --> 23:21.030]  Anyone see that? One of the biggest movies of the summer?
[23:21.130 --> 23:22.070]  I don't think any of us saw it.
[23:22.290 --> 23:26.570]  It did pretty much double Despicable Me, which was.
[23:27.250 --> 23:27.730]  Crazy.
[23:28.330 --> 23:28.830]  Which was cool.
[23:29.310 --> 23:30.950]  It just kept making money.
[23:31.470 --> 23:31.610]  Yep.
[23:32.470 --> 23:35.890]  And then you had Alien Romulus come out.
[23:36.230 --> 23:38.630]  Spent 13 points on that for $104 million.
[23:39.190 --> 23:41.690]  I think that should have done slightly more.
[23:42.690 --> 23:43.810]  Really? Was it good?
[23:44.370 --> 23:49.870]  I think in recent, I bet I'd be interested to see where it stacks up against all the
[23:49.870 --> 23:51.050]  Alien movies as a whole.
[23:51.310 --> 23:51.730]  Number three.
[23:52.330 --> 23:53.930]  It's the third highest earning one.
[23:54.850 --> 23:56.090]  Oh, in earnings? God, no.
[23:56.090 --> 23:58.270]  Yeah, no, not in goodness.
[23:59.390 --> 24:02.010]  So rank the Alien films in order from best to worst right now, go.
[24:02.690 --> 24:03.590]  Best to worst?
[24:03.990 --> 24:04.210]  Yeah.
[24:04.650 --> 24:05.090]  Yeah, go.
[24:05.730 --> 24:06.830]  Aliens, Alien.
[24:06.950 --> 24:07.070]  Yep.
[24:07.670 --> 24:08.190]  Romulus.
[24:11.970 --> 24:12.490]  Covenant.
[24:13.310 --> 24:14.090]  And then.
[24:17.890 --> 24:22.230]  You got to go Prometheus and then the Alien versus Predators on the back end, right?
[24:24.290 --> 24:25.490]  I like Prometheus.
[24:26.550 --> 24:27.710]  I never saw it.
[24:30.230 --> 24:30.930]  It's fine.
[24:32.330 --> 24:34.170]  I thought it wasn't an Alien movie.
[24:34.650 --> 24:36.890]  It's better if Covenant is already out.
[24:37.130 --> 24:39.090]  I think Covenant made Prometheus a bit better.
[24:39.810 --> 24:45.550]  Alien Romulus is the second highest grossing Alien movie in history.
[24:46.610 --> 24:50.990]  Prometheus, number one, it goes Prometheus, then Romulus, then Aliens,
[24:51.250 --> 24:54.350]  then Alien versus Predator, and then the original Alien.
[24:54.730 --> 24:56.730]  So Prometheus is an Alien movie?
[24:57.330 --> 24:57.850]  Yeah.
[24:58.370 --> 25:00.130]  I thought one of them wasn't an Alien movie.
[25:00.930 --> 25:02.050]  It is, but it's not.
[25:02.230 --> 25:03.330]  It is, but it's not.
[25:03.630 --> 25:04.830]  That's what people keep saying.
[25:05.950 --> 25:07.270]  It's a prequel.
[25:08.010 --> 25:08.230]  Yeah.
[25:08.230 --> 25:08.830]  Okay.
[25:09.250 --> 25:11.470]  Oh, but it has a Xenomorph in it.
[25:12.410 --> 25:14.530]  Well, it's got some kind of Alien in it.
[25:14.630 --> 25:15.730]  And it's got the space jockey.
[25:16.750 --> 25:17.010]  Yeah.
[25:17.450 --> 25:18.490]  So it's an Alien movie.
[25:19.050 --> 25:19.170]  Yeah.
[25:19.250 --> 25:23.490]  Yeah, I guess if you want to get technical in the fucking world of Alien,
[25:23.590 --> 25:25.010]  the Xenomorph didn't exist yet.
[25:25.030 --> 25:26.710]  But the thing that becomes the Xenomorph...
[25:27.470 --> 25:29.110]  Xenomorph is in that movie.
[25:31.530 --> 25:32.570]  The black goo.
[25:32.710 --> 25:34.610]  So why don't people just refer to it as a prequel?
[25:34.730 --> 25:36.750]  Why did people always say, well, it's not really an Alien movie?
[25:36.750 --> 25:39.290]  People thought it was a direct prequel.
[25:39.670 --> 25:42.830]  I think all the stuff that they thought they were seeing, they thought was in Alien.
[25:43.750 --> 25:44.070]  Yeah.
[25:44.290 --> 25:45.170]  But it was different shit.
[25:45.910 --> 25:50.270]  I think people who like the Alien franchise this much are weird to begin with
[25:50.270 --> 25:55.710]  and are very protective of lore that the guy who made it does not care less about.
[25:55.930 --> 25:58.150]  Like, he does not give a shit.
[25:58.230 --> 25:59.290]  And he just goes, yeah, I don't know.
[25:59.330 --> 26:00.910]  They're evil or they're good or something.
[26:01.150 --> 26:01.730]  And that's it.
[26:02.190 --> 26:04.730]  Ridley Scott has no respect for the Alien franchise.
[26:05.010 --> 26:06.110]  Zero. Zero.
[26:06.870 --> 26:08.770]  It's fantastic. I think it's great.
[26:09.510 --> 26:12.750]  Zero respect, but also like a weird amount of respect of like,
[26:12.850 --> 26:16.210]  no, we're going to explain what these things meant in the first movie.
[26:17.230 --> 26:21.350]  It's so odd that he cares about it, but also doesn't seem to care at all.
[26:21.610 --> 26:21.790]  Yep.
[26:21.990 --> 26:22.090]  Right.
[26:22.370 --> 26:23.510]  The engineers are Jesus.
[26:25.210 --> 26:28.750]  Then your last few were The Forge, Slingshot and City of Dreams.
[26:28.970 --> 26:30.290]  Yeah, I have no memory of those.
[26:30.350 --> 26:32.450]  But man, The Forge was good value per point.
[26:32.630 --> 26:32.930]  Jesus.
[26:33.790 --> 26:36.170]  I don't know anything about those three movies.
[26:36.170 --> 26:38.950]  Yeah. One point for 27 million.
[26:39.430 --> 26:40.630]  The hell was Slingshot?
[26:41.870 --> 26:42.210]  No idea.
[26:42.310 --> 26:43.050]  700 grand?
[26:43.650 --> 26:45.050]  What's The Forge?
[26:45.150 --> 26:46.710]  I just don't know what any of that stuff is.
[26:47.130 --> 26:50.590]  But, but it doesn't matter because you came in second.
[26:51.290 --> 26:57.510]  Because Andrew made over a billion dollars with his picks.
[26:57.590 --> 26:58.810]  Billion dollar opening.
[26:59.190 --> 27:02.730]  Only five, only five movies.
[27:03.190 --> 27:03.570]  Wow.
[27:04.190 --> 27:05.270]  Solid core.
[27:05.830 --> 27:06.170]  Wait.
[27:06.710 --> 27:07.130]  Solid core.
[27:07.290 --> 27:12.090]  How did Wolverine and Deadpool do in comparison with Inside Out in total?
[27:13.990 --> 27:15.110]  Inside Out was on mine.
[27:15.690 --> 27:16.430]  Made more, I think.
[27:17.210 --> 27:18.410]  No, it's Nix's Inside Out.
[27:18.590 --> 27:21.010]  Inside Out 2 is Gavit's 600.
[27:21.010 --> 27:21.670]  It made more.
[27:22.430 --> 27:23.850]  I had the highest grossing movie?
[27:24.610 --> 27:24.890]  Yeah.
[27:25.370 --> 27:25.890]  Damn it.
[27:25.970 --> 27:26.650]  And I still lost.
[27:26.990 --> 27:27.250]  Damn it.
[27:27.610 --> 27:27.730]  Yeah.
[27:28.070 --> 27:29.470]  Damn, it was so close.
[27:29.550 --> 27:29.930]  Look at that.
[27:30.830 --> 27:34.870]  I didn't realize that Inside Out 2 made more than Deadpool Wolverine.
[27:34.870 --> 27:35.490]  That's crazy.
[27:35.990 --> 27:40.970]  I, it just makes this, this whole thing just makes me hate Twisters even more.
[27:42.670 --> 27:43.710]  I'm with you, man.
[27:44.010 --> 27:44.530]  Absolutely.
[27:45.150 --> 27:45.630]  Absolutely.
[27:46.310 --> 27:48.830]  Look at that slow climb for Andrew too.
[27:49.190 --> 27:53.390]  Where it's like 91, then you, then it's 19.
[27:53.590 --> 27:55.770]  Fly Me to the Moon is, you've gone a whole month here.
[27:55.890 --> 27:58.170]  Where Garfield comes out at the end of May.
[27:58.250 --> 28:03.330]  And then you're going until almost, what, like late July?
[28:03.330 --> 28:05.570]  Until you have something that bangs on for you.
[28:05.710 --> 28:07.450]  And it, man, it, it hits hard.
[28:07.650 --> 28:08.470]  That's wild.
[28:08.950 --> 28:09.010]  Huge.
[28:09.010 --> 28:09.630]  Massive movie.
[28:10.110 --> 28:10.270]  Yeah.
[28:10.350 --> 28:15.170]  It's, it's sort of what, in my experience with these games, I've done this more than you guys have.
[28:15.450 --> 28:19.450]  It is, you want ideally one of those Deadpool and Wolverine.
[28:19.790 --> 28:23.390]  And then it's just about trying to get those things that really overperform like Twisters.
[28:23.750 --> 28:23.910]  Yeah.
[28:24.590 --> 28:27.270]  And that sort of range where it doesn't cost a ton of points.
[28:27.690 --> 28:30.010]  I wish it was already next summer so we could do it again.
[28:30.210 --> 28:30.830]  So do I.
[28:31.110 --> 28:31.630]  I'm excited.
[28:31.630 --> 28:32.210]  Yeah.
[28:32.390 --> 28:36.150]  The preview, what the next summer, like, I have no idea what's supposed to come out.
[28:36.310 --> 28:36.630]  No idea.
[28:36.870 --> 28:37.110]  This upcoming summer.
[28:37.310 --> 28:38.810]  I think a bunch of stuff they're saying.
[28:39.310 --> 28:42.270]  I mean, if we play by football rules, Eric just got relegated.
[28:42.410 --> 28:44.890]  And then I think we have to bring someone up from the community to replace him.
[28:44.890 --> 28:45.430]  So what do you do?
[28:45.490 --> 28:47.130]  You just like bring Gracie in or something?
[28:47.370 --> 28:47.690]  Oh, yeah.
[28:47.890 --> 28:48.210]  Great.
[28:48.210 --> 28:48.550]  Cool.
[28:49.410 --> 28:50.250]  No, that's not.
[28:50.330 --> 28:51.470]  That's not a suggestion.
[28:52.050 --> 28:52.970]  I want to play.
[28:53.210 --> 28:54.210]  I want to play.
[28:55.570 --> 28:56.590]  Oh, Eric will be back.
[28:56.750 --> 28:59.670]  And I don't know if you guys remember the prize for this thing.
[28:59.670 --> 29:03.490]  But for winning, I get to pick a watch along that we do.
[29:03.690 --> 29:06.910]  Oh, I already know what it's going to be.
[29:07.030 --> 29:07.770]  I got it in mind.
[29:07.830 --> 29:09.790]  I'm going to I'm going to sit on that for a little bit.
[29:09.890 --> 29:13.130]  We probably be we'll be watching something in November or December.
[29:13.890 --> 29:14.290]  Whoa.
[29:14.710 --> 29:16.630]  Do you think we'll do it with the Falcons or what?
[29:18.970 --> 29:19.770]  Very possible.
[29:20.190 --> 29:21.250]  Sounds Christmas related.
[29:22.270 --> 29:23.810]  Yeah, it is.
[29:23.950 --> 29:29.290]  It is a Christmas related film that I don't think I could get you guys to watch.
[29:29.290 --> 29:31.610]  In any other context, but this.
[29:31.830 --> 29:32.190]  Jingle all the way.
[29:32.330 --> 29:33.110]  Jingle all the way.

[29:46.590 --> 29:47.630]  Small Soldiers.
[29:48.530 --> 29:52.670]  If there was a Small Soldiers Christmas version, I'd be all about that.
[29:53.130 --> 29:54.130]  Jingle all the way to.
[29:54.350 --> 29:55.170]  I haven't seen it.
[29:55.650 --> 29:56.690]  Maybe I do like it.
[29:56.730 --> 29:57.210]  I don't know.
