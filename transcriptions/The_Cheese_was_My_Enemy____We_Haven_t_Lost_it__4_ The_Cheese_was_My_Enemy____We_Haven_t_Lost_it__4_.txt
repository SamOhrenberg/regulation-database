[00:00.000 --> 00:03.580]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.940 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[00:06.880 --> 00:10.520]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.960 --> 00:12.380]  Available for a limited time.
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.680]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.200 --> 00:18.560]  Hello and welcome to another episode of The Regulation Podcast.
[00:18.900 --> 00:22.940]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin and Gavin Free
[00:22.940 --> 00:25.320]  in that order of importance and popularity.
[00:25.520 --> 00:28.200]  This is episode four. Hi, guys.
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.660]  Oh, wait. I-
[00:29.660 --> 00:33.240]  That's a little- I mean, that's just factually correct, first of all.
[00:33.300 --> 00:34.140]  Sorry, Gavin. Go ahead.
[00:34.600 --> 00:36.540]  All right. Well, I heard the popularity part after I
[00:37.120 --> 00:39.360]  realized I wasn't paying attention to the order of the names.
[00:39.980 --> 00:43.120]  It was you then me. It was just him stating
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.800]  the guy with a huge slow motion YouTube channel on the side
[00:48.360 --> 00:52.440]  is bigger than the piss boy Vancouver child kicker.
[00:52.480 --> 00:53.800]  Who would predict?
[00:55.160 --> 00:56.840]  More popular in every metric.
[00:56.840 --> 00:59.340]  Jeff said that as a dig. It's just a fact.
[00:59.880 --> 01:01.560]  But on this podcast, you're the most popular.
[01:02.300 --> 01:03.880]  I don't think that's true.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.120]  Well, if we go by an egg, I'm first.
[01:06.220 --> 01:10.320]  But I think that's the only measuring system in which I'm ahead of everybody.
[01:10.760 --> 01:11.640]  I'll be honest.
[01:11.740 --> 01:14.360]  The gaslighting is so intense and immediate.
[01:14.540 --> 01:16.180]  I don't remember what I said now.
[01:17.940 --> 01:19.180]  Oh, you went Gavin than me?
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.180]  I'm pretty sure I didn't.
[01:21.280 --> 01:22.340]  I'm pretty sure I went the other way.
[01:22.380 --> 01:23.340]  But now you've got me.
[01:23.340 --> 01:24.520]  Now you've got me confused.
[01:24.520 --> 01:26.200]  I'm locked in.
[01:27.140 --> 01:30.440]  I thought I was bottom, but I couldn't international superstar.
[01:31.360 --> 01:32.840]  I have a free.
[01:34.080 --> 01:40.420]  I have a running list in my head at all times of the order of popularity of you to me.
[01:40.600 --> 01:42.820]  And I'm pretty sure Andrew's above Gavin right now.
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.500]  So I think I I don't think that's true at all.
[01:45.560 --> 01:46.700]  I think I said his name first.
[01:46.840 --> 01:48.020]  I disagree strongly.
[01:48.320 --> 01:50.280]  But, you know, we're our wires are crossed.
[01:50.340 --> 01:51.200]  We haven't done this in a bit.
[01:51.460 --> 01:52.080]  It's been a while.
[01:52.460 --> 01:52.900]  Yeah, I know.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.000]  I'm jet lagged.
[01:54.220 --> 01:54.860]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55.560 --> 01:56.620]  You're all home, though, right?
[01:56.680 --> 01:58.080]  Did you get you get some sleep last night?
[01:58.520 --> 01:59.580]  Yeah, but I was so tired.
[01:59.660 --> 02:02.420]  I fell asleep and like died that I woke up at four.
[02:02.600 --> 02:04.080]  So this feels like really late.
[02:04.300 --> 02:06.380]  It feels like we're recording at normal time.
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.320]  You've been up since four.
[02:07.800 --> 02:08.040]  Yeah.
[02:09.240 --> 02:12.060]  Also, it's weird because we're recording at a different time on a different day.
[02:12.100 --> 02:13.620]  So everything is just out of whack.
[02:13.660 --> 02:14.380]  It's all fucked.
[02:14.900 --> 02:15.740]  Who are we blaming for that?
[02:15.820 --> 02:15.920]  Me?
[02:16.740 --> 02:17.540]  Yeah, that's your fault.
[02:17.640 --> 02:18.080]  But that's OK.
[02:19.060 --> 02:20.720]  Yeah, I think I wouldn't even say.
[02:21.460 --> 02:25.900]  However, had you not been out of town on a trip, I would have had to reschedule today.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.600]  So then it would have been my fault.
[02:28.440 --> 02:30.340]  So I guess it would have been scot-free.
[02:30.540 --> 02:31.660]  Why did you even say anything?
[02:31.780 --> 02:33.500]  I guess I could have been.
[02:33.720 --> 02:34.200]  No one would have known.
[02:34.340 --> 02:36.160]  Because I'm trying to make a comedy podcast here.
[02:36.580 --> 02:37.620]  I would have been second.
[02:37.680 --> 02:39.240]  I guess I'm secondarily responsible.
[02:39.740 --> 02:43.560]  Like if you're unable to fill your duties of irresponsibility, I would step up.
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.880]  I feel like honesty is important and it makes you popular.
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.240]  And I think that you could potentially now be the most popular member of this podcast.
[02:51.580 --> 02:51.880]  Wow.
[02:52.520 --> 02:53.760]  That's very sweet of you to say.
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.640]  But I don't know.
[02:54.700 --> 02:58.040]  Going up against such heavyweights as the Canadian and the Brit.
[02:58.120 --> 02:58.880]  I don't know, man.
[03:00.720 --> 03:03.000]  Hard to compete with those two.
[03:03.120 --> 03:04.640]  I mean, you're saying it like it's high bar.
[03:04.940 --> 03:07.300]  I feel like it's low bar across the board.
[03:07.440 --> 03:07.700]  Oh, really?
[03:07.860 --> 03:10.980]  I thought the sarcasm was dripping, but I guess not.
[03:11.100 --> 03:11.520]  I'm sorry.
[03:11.700 --> 03:14.480]  No, listen, you just called me the Canadian.
[03:14.660 --> 03:15.780]  We don't do sarcasm.
[03:15.780 --> 03:16.340]  We don't do...
[03:17.800 --> 03:18.660]  That's not a thing.
[03:21.520 --> 03:22.920]  Why would you do that to me?
[03:24.620 --> 03:25.500]  Gavin, how was your trip?
[03:26.300 --> 03:27.100]  Oh, it was lovely.
[03:27.620 --> 03:28.160]  It was nice.
[03:28.620 --> 03:28.860]  Yep.
[03:29.300 --> 03:30.560]  Had a little birthday in England.
[03:31.220 --> 03:33.440]  Yeah. Oh, when was the last time you had a birthday in England?
[03:34.040 --> 03:35.100]  Oh, a few years ago, probably.
[03:35.360 --> 03:36.360]  Went to the cheese rolling.
[03:36.580 --> 03:38.140]  I know that you're a big fan of the cheese roll.
[03:38.220 --> 03:39.040]  Oh, of course.
[03:39.220 --> 03:42.280]  Yeah, I was very excited to see when you shared clips of the cheese roll.
[03:42.640 --> 03:45.120]  Was that your first time attending the cheese rolling?
[03:45.620 --> 03:46.060]  Yes.
[03:46.560 --> 03:49.440]  Was it as awesome as it looks?
[03:50.660 --> 03:54.060]  It's something I've realized that just doesn't come across well on camera.
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.040]  And even on my footage, that hill is freaking steep.
[03:58.420 --> 04:01.320]  Like, it is so immensely steep.
[04:01.420 --> 04:02.860]  I don't know how people don't die.
[04:04.940 --> 04:07.900]  Is this... now, having seen it, is this something that you think to yourself,
[04:07.940 --> 04:08.960]  like, I want to get into this?
[04:09.040 --> 04:10.620]  Like, I want to be... I want to roll down that hill.
[04:10.900 --> 04:12.160]  I would love to.
[04:12.660 --> 04:13.700]  Well, how do we make that happen?
[04:14.240 --> 04:16.800]  Um, well, I mean, there is just the risk.
[04:16.980 --> 04:24.080]  Like, uh, you know, I feel like currently I'm responsible for other people's stuff.
[04:24.220 --> 04:28.580]  And if I break my both legs, then everyone suffers.
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.360]  I think you could film slo-mo in a chair.
[04:32.140 --> 04:32.340]  Yeah?
[04:32.880 --> 04:34.140]  Did... let me ask you a question.
[04:34.540 --> 04:36.500]  Did any... you went to the cheese rolling, right?
[04:36.860 --> 04:37.080]  Yeah.
[04:37.260 --> 04:38.260]  And you saw the whole thing?
[04:38.840 --> 04:39.000]  Yep.
[04:39.100 --> 04:40.840]  Did anybody get taken off in an ambulance?
[04:41.500 --> 04:42.840]  Not that I saw, but...
[04:42.840 --> 04:43.760]  You're fine then.
[04:44.880 --> 04:48.140]  But based on some of the footage I got, I don't know how.
[04:50.180 --> 04:53.660]  Now, were you shooting this just for fun or was this a work gig?
[04:54.260 --> 04:55.840]  I was filming it for slo-mo.
[04:56.440 --> 04:59.400]  But I just... it was after I'd already booked my flights home,
[04:59.980 --> 05:02.640]  where I was like, when's that cheese roll?
[05:02.680 --> 05:03.300]  I should really try.
[05:03.420 --> 05:06.760]  And I realized it just happened to be in the middle of the week that I was home.
[05:06.900 --> 05:08.540]  So I just packed my smallest camera.
[05:09.040 --> 05:09.580]  That's awesome.
[05:09.580 --> 05:11.600]  So did you just roll up as an attendee,
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.080]  or did you let them know a world-famous high-speed photographer, Gavin Free,
[05:15.160 --> 05:16.520]  will be in attendance today at your event?
[05:17.060 --> 05:21.360]  No, I just... we went there and there was a little press area that I thought,
[05:21.560 --> 05:22.740]  yeah, I've got a camera and a tripod.
[05:26.180 --> 05:26.900]  That's awesome.
[05:27.200 --> 05:29.500]  Did you run into any comment leavers or...
[05:31.620 --> 05:33.740]  They got recognized a few times. I don't know if they...
[05:33.740 --> 05:36.180]  Oh, yeah, yeah, there was some actual comment leavers there.
[05:36.180 --> 05:40.300]  And even one of the BBC guys knew of this podcast.
[05:41.400 --> 05:42.160]  That's awesome.
[05:42.920 --> 05:45.120]  Did you tell him that maybe if he knows about it,
[05:45.140 --> 05:47.400]  maybe the world should know about it and the BBC should get behind it?
[05:47.440 --> 05:48.080]  God damn it.
[05:50.460 --> 05:52.660]  Like, we're making... we're making fucking news here.
[05:52.760 --> 05:54.560]  You think the BBC would include us in a news post?
[05:55.160 --> 05:56.720]  We're not called f***face anymore.
[05:57.700 --> 06:01.540]  That's all formerly, previously known as.
[06:02.940 --> 06:07.040]  We should... we should start off every conversation with every interviewer or media person with,
[06:07.100 --> 06:09.180]  you can talk about us now. It's okay.
[06:11.120 --> 06:12.960]  How long do you think until we get in Variety?
[06:15.760 --> 06:16.560]  That's the dream.
[06:17.980 --> 06:20.540]  That is the signal awards of 2024.
[06:21.960 --> 06:24.600]  Yeah, but don't you kind of not want to be in Variety now?
[06:24.960 --> 06:27.800]  Don't you kind of just want to be like, I'm a Hollywood reporter guy.
[06:27.920 --> 06:28.600]  F*** Variety.
[06:29.380 --> 06:31.220]  No, I mean, I'll be in that.
[06:31.220 --> 06:32.800]  We can do the Hollywood reporter.
[06:33.080 --> 06:34.700]  We can draw like a line in the sand.
[06:34.900 --> 06:37.160]  I mean, I'm not opposed to being in the Hollywood reporter as well.
[06:37.240 --> 06:38.240]  Right. Yeah.
[06:38.240 --> 06:39.820]  I think it's funnier if we end up in Variety.
[06:41.080 --> 06:43.400]  I have a beef with Hollywood press.
[06:43.660 --> 06:47.120]  It would be nice to end up in Variety for a good thing for once.
[06:49.220 --> 06:51.280]  Every time I've been in it, it has not been great.
[06:51.640 --> 06:53.360]  Yeah, that's fair.
[06:53.620 --> 06:55.640]  I can understand that from your perspective.
[06:56.740 --> 06:58.560]  With the cheese rolling, Gavin.
[06:59.060 --> 06:59.200]  Yeah.
[06:59.200 --> 07:04.160]  Did you have any temptation to try to track down that type of cheese?
[07:04.760 --> 07:06.020]  What would you do if you won?
[07:06.540 --> 07:07.860]  How do you travel with the cheese?
[07:08.360 --> 07:09.300]  Would you bring it with you?
[07:09.600 --> 07:11.500]  Because you're kind of lucky you could leave it with family.
[07:12.020 --> 07:13.320]  Oh, you mean if I ran the cheese roll?
[07:13.760 --> 07:14.380]  Yeah, if you ran it.
[07:14.380 --> 07:15.540]  Because you win the cheese, right?
[07:15.640 --> 07:16.960]  If you're on the run.
[07:17.680 --> 07:19.260]  First of all, how many runs do they do?
[07:19.400 --> 07:21.060]  How many cheeses do they give out?
[07:21.640 --> 07:22.500]  I saw four.
[07:23.200 --> 07:25.380]  Oh, that's a lot less than I was anticipating.
[07:25.660 --> 07:27.840]  Three men's runs and a woman's one.
[07:27.840 --> 07:29.960]  Is it all the same kind of cheese?
[07:30.900 --> 07:31.800]  I don't know.
[07:32.080 --> 07:34.640]  Honestly, the cheese was my enemy that day.
[07:34.840 --> 07:40.060]  Because I was right at the bottom of the hill, directly in the middle.
[07:41.300 --> 07:45.300]  And everyone, all the real press, were hiding behind hay bales.
[07:45.800 --> 07:48.520]  And we were just shoved off to the side.
[07:48.840 --> 07:52.160]  All the people with real equipment were like, yeah, piss off, we got this spot.
[07:52.420 --> 07:53.940]  So we were just shoved over and over.
[07:53.940 --> 07:59.660]  And then a bunch of people with GoPros and whoever felt like it started climbing into the press area.
[08:00.100 --> 08:06.000]  So I was shoved even further over, completely exposed to the cheese.
[08:06.440 --> 08:11.580]  So for the first five seconds of the 10 second cheese roll,
[08:12.060 --> 08:14.580]  I was just trying not to be killed by cheese.
[08:15.560 --> 08:18.560]  Because it comes cooking down that hill.
[08:18.940 --> 08:20.600]  So I would just be watching the cheese.
[08:20.900 --> 08:22.940]  And then after it missed me, I would start filming.
[08:23.660 --> 08:28.760]  Hey, Nick, there's about seven sound drops in there, if you could pull those out.
[08:28.860 --> 08:29.580]  They're all gold.
[08:29.820 --> 08:31.120]  Oh yeah, you got it.
[08:31.300 --> 08:31.600]  Thank you.
[08:31.680 --> 08:32.040]  Oh, what happened?
[08:32.720 --> 08:34.280]  No, you just said a lot of really awesome stuff.
[08:34.360 --> 08:34.820]  Oh, shit.
[08:35.440 --> 08:37.600]  Well, we should isolate and hold on to forever.
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.240]  One more thing about the cheese thing.
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.960]  What was the craziest thing that you saw at the cheese thing?
[08:44.020 --> 08:45.260]  Well, a lot of drunk people.
[08:46.500 --> 08:47.420]  Yeah, I assume.
[08:47.820 --> 08:48.920]  I feel like that goes with it.
[08:49.340 --> 08:52.920]  I just saw so many necks get real bent up.
[08:55.920 --> 08:57.820]  One guy was great too.
[08:57.900 --> 09:00.980]  He face planted so hard, both of his shoes flew off.
[09:02.160 --> 09:04.920]  Did you see like scorpion after scorpion?
[09:05.140 --> 09:05.540]  Oh, yeah.
[09:05.640 --> 09:09.620]  Some of the most awkward looking scorpions I've ever seen in my life.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.140]  Like scorpions on the move while twisting.
[09:12.960 --> 09:17.520]  On a scale of one to ten for fun, where did it land?
[09:18.100 --> 09:18.880]  Oh, to watch?
[09:19.140 --> 09:19.360]  Yeah.
[09:19.780 --> 09:20.380]  Like a nine.
[09:21.180 --> 09:21.580]  Wow.
[09:22.100 --> 09:26.580]  Should we make it a regulation event and maybe go next year or sometime in the future?
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.240]  Do you think it's worth us doing that?
[09:28.640 --> 09:31.040]  Yeah, but it's like it's not really an organized event anymore.
[09:31.320 --> 09:33.360]  It's more of just like a bunch of people.
[09:33.580 --> 09:33.980]  It can't be, right?
[09:34.260 --> 09:36.360]  Like they crack down on it being organized.
[09:36.660 --> 09:38.280]  I mean, I feel like that's better.
[09:38.600 --> 09:43.780]  You know, I feel like that's what you want when nobody's in charge and nobody takes responsibility.
[09:44.080 --> 09:45.800]  That's when the real fun shit happens.
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.200]  Yeah, it is truly a shit show.
[09:48.520 --> 09:51.100]  And we got to get there early if we're going to make a thing of it.
[09:51.580 --> 09:53.420]  How do you figure out when it is?
[09:53.800 --> 09:55.180]  It's pretty public still, right?
[09:55.260 --> 09:57.000]  Just look it up.
[09:57.380 --> 10:00.600]  Yeah, it's not like they're fucking spray painting cheese to the wall.
[10:00.720 --> 10:03.260]  And like you got to crack the code where it is.
[10:03.400 --> 10:04.340]  It's an ARG episode.
[10:04.800 --> 10:05.060]  Yeah.
[10:06.380 --> 10:07.400]  I love cheese.
[10:09.660 --> 10:10.660]  Oh my God.
[10:10.700 --> 10:11.840]  I'm sorry, I just made myself laugh.
[10:12.700 --> 10:14.440]  Yeah, that was good, right?
[10:14.460 --> 10:15.020]  I love cheese.
[10:15.540 --> 10:18.320]  If you're 100 years old, you'll remember the Halo 2 ARG.
[10:18.400 --> 10:18.880]  I love bees.
[10:19.040 --> 10:19.520]  Yeah, I love bees.
[10:19.620 --> 10:20.020]  Yeah.
[10:22.480 --> 10:23.280]  Thank you.
[10:23.340 --> 10:24.020]  How was your birthday?
[10:24.580 --> 10:25.120]  You have fun?
[10:25.520 --> 10:26.560]  Yeah, uneventful.
[10:26.980 --> 10:27.380]  Uneventful.
[10:27.640 --> 10:29.380]  We made birthday content for you.
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.580]  I'm excited for you to say.
[10:31.080 --> 10:33.580]  Is that why you all just started texting me how like that?
[10:33.640 --> 10:34.720]  I was a great guy.
[10:35.040 --> 10:36.160]  Still hasn't responded.
[10:36.660 --> 10:40.040]  It was your birthday and we were just trying to wish you well.
[10:40.600 --> 10:41.620]  Thought it would be nice.
[10:42.320 --> 10:44.060]  Yeah, it was just all at the same time.
[10:44.140 --> 10:46.260]  And also Nick text me, which I don't think has ever happened.
[10:52.300 --> 10:59.120]  There maybe was a conversation about how when you are when you're told that you're a great guy,
[10:59.260 --> 11:04.720]  you respond instantly. And I still haven't technically received a response from that text.
[11:04.760 --> 11:07.700]  Yeah, I didn't. I don't think I replied to you individually.
[11:08.460 --> 11:12.520]  No, I would just watch the video if I were you.
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.160]  Yeah, it's a lot of us just sharing our feelings about you and celebrating you
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.820]  and how much we love you and talking about how great you are and all the things that make you, you.
[11:23.480 --> 11:25.900]  Yeah, I think you're going to enjoy it a lot.
[11:26.140 --> 11:31.620]  Yeah, this is so like, it sounds so like dastardly.
[11:32.800 --> 11:34.460]  Yeah, I feel very uneasy.
[11:36.060 --> 11:40.500]  I don't know why you're going to get like a 45 minute expression of love
[11:40.500 --> 11:44.680]  of the three best friends and then the guy who's never texted you before.
[11:49.380 --> 11:54.600]  You said you're feeling uneasy. I had an all time uneasy moment the other day,
[11:54.640 --> 12:00.640]  and I've realized that I need to be more when I'm doing actions.
[12:00.640 --> 12:03.320]  I need to think them through further.
[12:03.600 --> 12:04.100]  No, you don't.
[12:04.220 --> 12:04.600]  I can't.
[12:05.220 --> 12:07.220]  No, you what? No, hold on. No, no, no.
[12:07.860 --> 12:09.340]  Where did you get that in your head?
[12:09.600 --> 12:13.820]  Well, OK, well, what typically I'll be doing like three or four things at once,
[12:13.820 --> 12:19.460]  and then I'll just go solution to problem, do do solution and then not fully
[12:19.460 --> 12:22.520]  think about the potential consequences of said thing.
[12:22.960 --> 12:27.560]  It was I was sitting at my desk and I was I was like updating
[12:27.560 --> 12:30.620]  something on our Patreon page, and I was looking at something for a game.
[12:31.260 --> 12:35.320]  And I realized, oh, I hadn't taken my anxiety medicine for the day.
[12:35.400 --> 12:36.760]  I take like one pill a day.
[12:36.820 --> 12:37.800]  It was like, I need to take it.
[12:38.080 --> 12:40.260]  But all of the things on my desk were empty.
[12:40.260 --> 12:43.900]  All of the the like beverages I had outside of one.
[12:44.020 --> 12:46.540]  So I went, oh, I'll just I'll drink this one with my pill.
[12:46.780 --> 12:47.920]  And so I put the pill in my mouth.
[12:48.080 --> 12:53.540]  Then I took a drink and I forgot that that beverage contained boba balls in it.
[12:53.600 --> 12:55.060]  So I have a pill in my mouth.
[12:55.260 --> 13:01.040]  And then all of a sudden there is like 15 boba pearls in my mouth.
[13:01.140 --> 13:05.600]  And I go into full panic mode because how am I going to swallow all of this?
[13:05.940 --> 13:09.700]  It's just feel basically put like a bunch of other pills in your mouth.
[13:09.700 --> 13:11.360]  Yeah, it was with pills.
[13:11.560 --> 13:18.120]  It was a massive amount of just circular balls in my mouth.
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.580]  That is an unfortunate combination of words, but it is what happened.
[13:21.760 --> 13:22.520]  All balls are circular.
[13:23.220 --> 13:29.480]  Yeah, well, I panicked and I tried to crush all the balls in my mouth and my tongue.
[13:30.540 --> 13:36.820]  And that resulted in me missing and then me accidentally swallowing.
[13:37.040 --> 13:39.460]  And then the pill is melting at the same time.
[13:39.700 --> 13:42.880]  So I thought I'll just try again, but I'll lift the straw up higher.
[13:43.060 --> 13:44.540]  But that still didn't work.
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.520]  So I ended up just having to swallow like four boba pearls alongside my pill.
[13:49.740 --> 13:51.760]  And it was just complete chaos.
[13:52.020 --> 13:56.400]  It was a very relaxed time to all of a sudden instant panic.
[13:56.940 --> 14:01.000]  Did the size of the straw not give away what kind of beverage it was going to be?
[14:01.560 --> 14:05.960]  The fact I ordered it gave away what type of beverage it was going to be.
[14:06.060 --> 14:07.800]  The issue was I just wasn't thinking.
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.640]  Now, I would think you explain that story to us just now.
[14:12.880 --> 14:20.060]  And what I heard was a perfectly reasonable interaction that went the way it should have.
[14:20.160 --> 14:22.060]  What you're describing is how that should have gone.
[14:22.400 --> 14:24.960]  I don't know why you would want to change your line of thought,
[14:25.020 --> 14:27.540]  because I feel like everything that you just explained makes
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.540]  should the universe wanted it to happen that way.
[14:30.700 --> 14:32.460]  And we want to make the universe happy.
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.900]  I don't know how if I can convey the genuine level of shock when all the
[14:38.900 --> 14:41.500]  boba pearls flew into my mouth on that first sip.
[14:41.620 --> 14:45.040]  That was supposed to happen. We needed that to happen.
[14:45.260 --> 14:47.820]  For balance, the universe needed that to happen.
[14:48.020 --> 14:49.420]  Please don't take that away from us.
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.420]  I'm not going to. I've been capable of changing in that way.
[14:53.780 --> 14:55.360]  But it was a moment of God damn it.
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.140]  I wish I wish I just thought this through a little bit more.
[14:59.320 --> 15:01.780]  I wish I didn't just drink the drink.
[15:01.780 --> 15:04.220]  I wish I got up, got a new glass of water.
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.660]  But instead, now I have all these pearls in my mouth and it started to melt in my mouth.
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.620]  The pill, I'm very thankful it was like a lemonade boba type thing because it covered up.
[15:14.780 --> 15:18.540]  But I could, you know, like when a pill lasts too long in your mouth and you start to taste it
[15:18.540 --> 15:20.540]  and it's terrible, pills always taste the worst.
[15:20.680 --> 15:23.720]  It was that, but I thankfully had a mask.
[15:23.920 --> 15:26.560]  I feel like I'm usually a new drink guy anyway.
[15:26.780 --> 15:30.740]  Like if if a glass of water has been out all night, it goes all old.
[15:31.440 --> 15:33.640]  Yeah, I always assume.
[15:34.240 --> 15:38.680]  I always assume that if I leave like a glass of water out overnight while I'm asleep,
[15:39.080 --> 15:41.540]  cockroaches and bugs are going to use it as a swimming pool.
[15:43.460 --> 15:46.300]  And then in the morning I'll be like, oh, I think it's totally fine.
[15:46.360 --> 15:49.720]  But really, like some cockroaches doing the backstroke in it and maybe like
[15:49.720 --> 15:52.780]  maybe two drunk flies were banging like it's a hot tub.
[15:53.040 --> 15:57.660]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[15:57.660 --> 16:00.680]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity.
[16:01.240 --> 16:04.460]  Plus it's heated and it just feels so good.
[16:05.640 --> 16:10.220]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car.
[16:11.780 --> 16:13.820]  Suddenly, it seems quite practical.
[16:14.500 --> 16:16.940]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[16:17.280 --> 16:20.560]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats.
[16:20.900 --> 16:22.420]  It only feels extravagant.
[16:23.380 --> 16:26.840]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between
[16:26.840 --> 16:28.780]  the peanut butter group and Chocolaty Corp.
[16:28.960 --> 16:30.820]  Joining me is a PBC executive.
[16:31.040 --> 16:32.000]  Thanks for having me, Barry.
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.440]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it,
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.620]  Jif peanut butter and chocolate flavored spread, would be a success?
[16:39.040 --> 16:42.900]  You know, it was a gut feeling, a rumbling, if you will.
[16:43.240 --> 16:45.400]  Besides, they're two titans of taste.
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.640]  Very true. Goes great with pretzels.
[16:47.820 --> 16:48.540]  And pancakes.
[16:49.100 --> 16:49.840]  Apples too, I bet.
[16:50.280 --> 16:51.500]  Try Jif PBC today.
[16:52.740 --> 16:54.900]  Does it happen here? Because in England,
[16:55.020 --> 16:57.680]  I remember if you fill a glass of water the night before,
[16:57.740 --> 17:00.100]  the next morning, it's going to be all full of bubbles and taste weird.
[17:00.840 --> 17:04.100]  And here, the tap water is so freaking disgusting.
[17:04.240 --> 17:05.960]  I just don't drink it. Like, does it happen here too?
[17:06.800 --> 17:08.060]  If you leave it out, yeah.
[17:08.500 --> 17:11.460]  Yeah, just gets all like weird and bubbly and gross.
[17:11.640 --> 17:14.920]  And I don't know if bubbly, I don't think I'd describe it as bubbly for me.
[17:15.200 --> 17:17.200]  Also, don't know that I'd describe it as bubbly.
[17:17.520 --> 17:19.640]  But it gets flat and still.
[17:19.760 --> 17:20.340]  Because it gets weird.
[17:21.020 --> 17:21.940]  Yeah, it tastes weird.
[17:21.940 --> 17:23.380]  It definitely tastes off.
[17:23.840 --> 17:26.140]  It definitely tastes like it's been sitting forever.
[17:26.300 --> 17:28.700]  But you don't have the bubbles stuck to the inside of the glass?
[17:31.600 --> 17:34.420]  Does British tap water carbonate itself overnight?
[17:34.560 --> 17:35.100]  Is that what you're saying?
[17:35.220 --> 17:36.180]  I don't know what happens with it,
[17:36.240 --> 17:38.500]  but I'm sure if you're in England, you've seen it with the water.
[17:38.860 --> 17:42.320]  Just leave a glass of water for a day and there's bubbles on the inside now.
[17:42.760 --> 17:44.560]  I think what I'm imagining is bubbles.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.220]  Maybe we all need to fill a glass of water half full and stick it somewhere in our house
[17:49.800 --> 17:52.800]  as after this recording ends and then take a picture of it
[17:52.800 --> 17:55.020]  and then in 24 hours come back and look at the results.
[17:55.220 --> 17:56.220]  I think that's a great idea.
[17:56.400 --> 17:59.520]  There are people listening to this right now who don't know what we're talking about.
[17:59.620 --> 18:03.700]  And there's other people fucking screaming at their phones about how...
[18:03.700 --> 18:04.320]  Yeah, bubbles!
[18:04.820 --> 18:05.800]  Yeah, the water bubbles!
[18:06.560 --> 18:08.880]  I don't... I just think it goes stale.
[18:09.040 --> 18:10.600]  I don't know that I've seen bubbles, right?
[18:10.720 --> 18:13.060]  You feel it just... stale.
[18:13.160 --> 18:14.260]  I wouldn't even describe it as...
[18:14.860 --> 18:17.160]  The taste is so bad when you leave it.
[18:17.160 --> 18:22.160]  I filter all of the water I drink here and it means that the bubble thing doesn't happen.
[18:22.620 --> 18:25.640]  So typically, I'm drinking my water out of a Kerpler.
[18:25.820 --> 18:27.680]  Like, I'll go get it, I'll drink the glass.
[18:27.800 --> 18:29.420]  It's all a singular thing.
[18:29.820 --> 18:31.300]  I don't... I'm not going to leave water overnight.
[18:31.760 --> 18:34.560]  I ran into this problem when we were...
[18:34.560 --> 18:35.620]  When we were streaming.
[18:35.820 --> 18:39.120]  We're deep into our stream and I'm still trying to resolve it.
[18:39.480 --> 18:43.860]  Because the bottles that I stream out of are large...
[18:43.860 --> 18:45.220]  They don't fit in the sink.
[18:45.860 --> 18:47.620]  And you're also supposed to...
[18:47.620 --> 18:50.360]  Apparently, it carbonates better if it's cold.
[18:51.240 --> 18:54.120]  So the only thing I could do is...
[18:54.120 --> 18:58.100]  If I wanted to, like, avoid having to go downstairs to, like, the kitchen sink.
[18:58.260 --> 18:59.960]  Is to fill it in the bathtub.
[19:00.540 --> 19:05.200]  But I didn't want to leave it in the fridge overnight because the bubbling thing...
[19:06.800 --> 19:07.720]  Wait, what?
[19:08.340 --> 19:08.800]  Well, because...
[19:09.280 --> 19:10.600]  You're drinking bathtub water?
[19:11.100 --> 19:11.960]  Well, no, because...
[19:11.960 --> 19:12.660]  Well, no.
[19:12.820 --> 19:14.000]  So I would...
[19:14.000 --> 19:15.500]  When I'm carbonating...
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.320]  When I'm carbonating, the thing doesn't fit in the sink where I get my tap water, typically.
[19:21.860 --> 19:25.140]  But it does fit in the tub and it's all the same water.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.580]  There's no difference in the water.
[19:28.100 --> 19:29.440]  I just don't know why he said no.
[19:31.080 --> 19:33.380]  No, I understand why he says no.
[19:33.460 --> 19:36.020]  Because when you say tub water, you're implying...
[19:36.020 --> 19:37.620]  You're acting like that's a different thing.
[19:37.700 --> 19:40.900]  And then got in the bathtub and then scooped the thing...
[19:40.900 --> 19:43.300]  Scooped the soda stream thing in and grabbed the water.
[19:43.300 --> 19:49.140]  And all he's doing is saying he needs the clearance under the tub nozzle to fill the water.
[19:49.240 --> 19:49.380]  Yeah.
[19:49.640 --> 19:51.220]  Now, Andrew, I'm right here with you.
[19:51.560 --> 19:54.240]  And also just saying tub water is different than tap.
[19:54.240 --> 19:54.920]  It's the same thing.
[19:55.040 --> 19:55.640]  It's the same water.
[19:56.180 --> 19:56.580]  It's no different.
[19:56.660 --> 19:57.600]  Just it's tap water.
[19:58.000 --> 19:59.040]  It's all tap water.
[19:59.500 --> 20:00.760]  Just one comes out of the tub.
[20:01.240 --> 20:02.480]  But hot water...
[20:02.480 --> 20:03.460]  Well, I guess that depends too.
[20:03.720 --> 20:06.460]  Like some people's hot water comes out of a tank and it's not potable.
[20:07.120 --> 20:07.580]  Oh, yeah.
[20:08.060 --> 20:08.380]  Not in America.
[20:08.680 --> 20:09.840]  I'm not using hot water.
[20:09.880 --> 20:11.400]  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about there,
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.440]  but there's no hot water in a house in America that's not potable.
[20:15.080 --> 20:15.840]  You don't have a tank?
[20:16.560 --> 20:20.200]  Some houses have hot water tanks or we have waterless heating systems,
[20:20.340 --> 20:22.980]  but you still can drink the hot water out of your tap.
[20:23.600 --> 20:24.000]  Oh.
[20:24.600 --> 20:26.500]  Have you never drank the hot water out of...
[20:27.020 --> 20:28.200]  I mean, I guess, when would you?
[20:29.120 --> 20:32.720]  But have you just been like avoiding hot water getting in your mouth forever here?
[20:32.880 --> 20:33.120]  Yeah.
[20:34.360 --> 20:35.140]  Well, I grew up with...
[20:35.140 --> 20:36.220]  Do you take cold showers?
[20:37.500 --> 20:38.500]  I grew up with the...
[20:38.500 --> 20:41.160]  You know, the English taps where there's like a cold tap and a hot tap
[20:41.160 --> 20:41.960]  and they're separate taps?
[20:42.240 --> 20:42.780]  Uh-huh.
[20:43.320 --> 20:45.640]  That's because you can't drink the hot one.
[20:46.640 --> 20:47.780]  Then you don't want to mix them.
[20:48.180 --> 20:48.560]  So, wait.
[20:48.860 --> 20:51.820]  What the fuck kind of third world country is England, dude?
[20:51.820 --> 20:55.120]  The whole time you've lived here, when you take like a hot shower,
[20:55.280 --> 20:57.180]  do you keep your mouth like so closed?
[20:58.220 --> 20:59.820]  I think, yeah, I think I have a habit.
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.600]  If the water is hot, I don't open my mouth.
[21:02.920 --> 21:03.700]  It's so weird.
[21:03.820 --> 21:05.860]  In America, the hotter it is, the safer it is.
[21:05.960 --> 21:07.480]  That's fucking...
[21:07.480 --> 21:09.300]  We boil stuff to get rid of the impurities.
[21:09.300 --> 21:10.160]  Yeah, you can...
[21:11.100 --> 21:15.380]  No one's stood in the shower sucking on a drink while they're showering.
[21:15.460 --> 21:16.260]  What are you talking about?
[21:16.280 --> 21:19.680]  No, but we're not avoiding it because we think it's not safe to drink either.
[21:19.820 --> 21:22.960]  I mean, it will get in my mouth, but I'll gauze it back out onto the floor.
[21:23.040 --> 21:25.060]  I'm not going to just be like, oh, I see it, I'm going to swallow it.
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.100]  The only time I've ever had to deal with non-potable water
[21:28.100 --> 21:30.860]  is when I was in the fucking deserts of Kuwait
[21:30.860 --> 21:34.060]  taking a shower off the back of like a tanker truck.
[21:34.660 --> 21:35.960]  That's the only time you...
[21:35.960 --> 21:38.220]  It doesn't make its way into our homes, dude.
[21:38.220 --> 21:39.720]  Would you drink toilet water?
[21:40.180 --> 21:41.340]  Well, not because I piss in there,
[21:41.500 --> 21:45.680]  but if the water itself is coming from the same place all the other water does.
[21:46.140 --> 21:50.640]  Like if you get to it before it touches the pea sides, it's clean water.
[21:51.160 --> 21:52.460]  I've got a scenario for you, Geoff.
[21:52.660 --> 21:52.980]  Okay.
[21:53.280 --> 21:56.800]  If you had to drink the tub water of someone on this podcast,
[21:57.300 --> 21:58.480]  whose would you take a swig of?
[22:02.030 --> 22:02.430]  Yours.
[22:03.010 --> 22:04.290]  I really don't think it matters.
[22:04.750 --> 22:06.070]  I think I would take it out of yours.
[22:06.410 --> 22:07.910]  I feel like it would bring us closer together.
[22:08.410 --> 22:09.270]  Oh, God.
[22:09.970 --> 22:11.690]  I'm quite hairy, though. I don't think you want mine.
[22:12.610 --> 22:13.210]  No, I don't.
[22:13.490 --> 22:14.850]  I don't think I would enjoy it anyway,
[22:14.950 --> 22:17.350]  but I would pick you just because I've known you the longest.
[22:17.890 --> 22:19.090]  It's like a tenure thing.
[22:19.490 --> 22:20.470]  Yeah, it's a tenure thing.
[22:20.570 --> 22:22.570]  I'm the most comfortable around you because of that.
[22:22.650 --> 22:26.890]  And I just feel like our friendship would have the best chance of survival after.
[22:27.570 --> 22:30.370]  Now, when you say that, Gavin, are you saying it in the context that I'm using it?
[22:30.650 --> 22:32.430]  That I'm filling my bottle with water?
[22:32.470 --> 22:34.950]  Like I'm just I'm using the tap in the tub?
[22:35.390 --> 22:36.790]  Because if so, it really doesn't matter.
[22:37.270 --> 22:37.670]  Wait, what?
[22:38.270 --> 22:41.230]  So I'm leaning in the tub, right?
[22:41.410 --> 22:45.410]  Like I twist the knob for cold water and then I stand next to the tub
[22:45.410 --> 22:48.670]  and I put it underneath the thing where the water comes out.
[22:48.950 --> 22:50.330]  And then I fill it and I leave.
[22:50.970 --> 22:55.110]  No, you're just dunking your cup or bottle into someone's bath.
[22:55.690 --> 22:57.730]  Oh, no. Okay, that yeah, that's...
[22:58.270 --> 22:59.410]  Is there soap in the bath?
[23:00.050 --> 23:00.350]  No.
[23:01.070 --> 23:02.870]  But they've been in the bath.
[23:02.950 --> 23:04.730]  They just have been in without products.
[23:04.910 --> 23:07.410]  Yeah, but I feel like Andrew's would be the strongest.
[23:07.670 --> 23:10.490]  Because he stews for longer.
[23:11.270 --> 23:11.630]  Interesting.
[23:12.010 --> 23:12.230]  Yeah.
[23:12.790 --> 23:14.730]  He's overly steeped.
[23:14.730 --> 23:17.210]  Who do you think makes the least powerful water?
[23:18.610 --> 23:20.850]  Uh, probably whoever takes the quickest bath.
[23:21.510 --> 23:21.990]  Oh, yeah.
[23:22.090 --> 23:23.150]  Probably me then.
[23:23.770 --> 23:24.850]  You got a speed bath?
[23:25.070 --> 23:26.290]  I got army in me.
[23:26.470 --> 23:29.130]  You know, I can't eat or bathe longer than like 30 seconds.
[23:29.230 --> 23:30.250]  I gotta get it fucking in and out.
[23:30.530 --> 23:32.470]  When was the last time you sat in a bath, Geoff?
[23:32.730 --> 23:34.030]  Like you took a bath bath.
[23:34.030 --> 23:41.210]  I took a bath maybe a month ago because I was sore.
[23:41.610 --> 23:42.170]  And I wanted to...
[23:42.930 --> 23:43.910]  Oh, it's because of diverticulitis.
[23:44.250 --> 23:46.610]  About a month ago, I had a diverticulitis flare up.
[23:46.850 --> 23:51.390]  And sometimes I it helps to lay in the bathtub in hot water for a little while.
[23:51.470 --> 23:55.750]  So that but before that, maybe I would say I take two baths a year, maybe.
[23:56.150 --> 23:56.530]  Wow.
[23:56.770 --> 24:01.510]  And it's always like, oh, I fucking pull the muscle and I need to lay in hot water
[24:01.510 --> 24:04.250]  with Epsom salt or something to to relax.
[24:04.510 --> 24:06.550]  Yeah, probably probably no more than two a year.
[24:07.070 --> 24:10.430]  When I went into this story, I never thought it would lead into Gavin being weird.
[24:10.570 --> 24:12.470]  A Gavin weirdness being exposed.
[24:12.770 --> 24:14.790]  That was not the direction I was anticipating.
[24:15.090 --> 24:16.050]  What was I doing that was weird?
[24:16.370 --> 24:16.710]  What do you mean?
[24:16.730 --> 24:20.830]  Not drinking hot water, avoiding all hot water, thinking it's not safe.
[24:21.290 --> 24:22.370]  That's an odd thing.
[24:22.730 --> 24:24.290]  I understand your context.
[24:24.390 --> 24:25.210]  It's gross, too.
[24:25.310 --> 24:29.150]  I mean, I'll drink boiled water, but just hot water.
[24:30.070 --> 24:30.990]  What's that for?
[24:31.470 --> 24:33.110]  Lukewarm, but like warm water.
[24:34.750 --> 24:35.550]  Tastes like shit.
[24:36.950 --> 24:39.470]  Yeah, I'm not a fan of hot beverages in general.
[24:40.050 --> 24:41.710]  I mean, I'm just I prefer cold.
[24:42.870 --> 24:44.850]  But I just I never thought that's so weird.
[24:44.910 --> 24:47.890]  The idea that you can't drink half your water is fascinating.
[24:49.110 --> 24:50.770]  You can't drink it.
[24:50.870 --> 24:53.070]  It's that he can't drink it based on a false premise.
[24:56.850 --> 24:59.650]  What I've learned in this process is it really hurt my streaming.
[24:59.650 --> 25:05.070]  Like, I've got a lot of I don't even know, syrup, I guess I can mix with.
[25:05.390 --> 25:09.470]  But I haven't been doing it the ratio because I want to try it being cold.
[25:09.670 --> 25:10.390]  But I can't.
[25:10.730 --> 25:12.110]  It takes too long to be cold.
[25:12.370 --> 25:15.790]  And it'd be nice to just like prep bottles ahead of time for carbonation.
[25:16.430 --> 25:18.950]  And I'm scared to carbonate the water and then leave it
[25:19.390 --> 25:22.470]  because I feel like it'll it'll get stale.
[25:23.010 --> 25:24.350]  Like you guys were saying before.
[25:24.850 --> 25:27.630]  So I've been trying to find a solution for that, and I haven't found it yet.
[25:27.630 --> 25:33.010]  I did do some deep diving into if you could buy water purifiers for your bathtub.
[25:33.610 --> 25:36.130]  And they do not exist in the way that I need them to.
[25:36.750 --> 25:39.030]  Well, it is like market we could get into.
[25:39.610 --> 25:42.750]  It's like salt bags you can put on the front like it is.
[25:42.930 --> 25:45.930]  It is more a cosmetic thing, but it's like adding to the water.
[25:46.150 --> 25:48.710]  I haven't been able to find just like a Brita for your tub.
[25:50.130 --> 25:51.810]  Why would you who would need that?
[25:52.170 --> 25:54.770]  I do for my carbonation.
[25:54.950 --> 25:56.330]  Just because you don't like changing floors.
[25:56.690 --> 25:58.730]  Yeah, well, it's just it would be more convenient.
[25:58.970 --> 26:01.190]  Why don't you just move your room downstairs?
[26:01.770 --> 26:04.350]  Well, I have my stuff, my work set up, my office.
[26:04.450 --> 26:05.050]  It wouldn't work.
[26:05.170 --> 26:06.630]  It's an open concept downstairs.
[26:08.490 --> 26:09.330]  Yelling all throughout.
[26:09.910 --> 26:10.870]  I need space.
[26:10.910 --> 26:11.390]  I need a little.
[26:11.550 --> 26:12.150]  I need a corner.
[26:13.930 --> 26:17.770]  I wouldn't be able to fit the I don't know.
[26:18.390 --> 26:20.270]  My two Xboxes, my three Xbox.
[26:20.430 --> 26:22.290]  It's just an Xbox City over here.
[26:22.730 --> 26:23.750]  I can't do that downstairs.
[26:24.570 --> 26:26.110]  I also don't want to be next to the kitchen.
[26:26.330 --> 26:28.210]  That's a busy place to be.
[26:29.830 --> 26:33.250]  I'd rather just have my own fake kitchen upstairs with my Brita.
[26:33.910 --> 26:38.250]  I think I'm going to get you can get like jug Brita's, right?
[26:38.630 --> 26:39.770]  Yeah, I think that might be.
[26:39.890 --> 26:40.190]  I used to have one.
[26:40.310 --> 26:40.830]  They're fine.
[26:41.390 --> 26:41.970]  They're fine.
[26:42.050 --> 26:42.270]  Okay.
[26:42.510 --> 26:48.310]  What if you run a hose from the downstairs kitchen out of the house,
[26:48.950 --> 26:50.710]  up the side of the wall and into your room?
[26:51.250 --> 26:55.330]  Well, the problem with the hose is that you have to be at the source to turn it on or off.
[26:55.330 --> 26:57.730]  Leave it on and then just cork it.
[26:58.690 --> 27:02.810]  You mean like one of those hoses where you can like twist the
[27:03.390 --> 27:06.390]  knob to like have the flow go or not go?
[27:06.550 --> 27:06.750]  Yeah.
[27:07.250 --> 27:10.150]  Is that if I leave the water running, is it just I get
[27:11.910 --> 27:14.890]  environmentally like what are we what are we talking about for the environment with that?
[27:14.970 --> 27:15.510]  Is that bad?
[27:15.730 --> 27:17.550]  The environment is there's no water coming out.
[27:18.270 --> 27:21.410]  I think you should just get one of these guns and then have that.
[27:21.410 --> 27:23.990]  And that's how you fill up your bottles.
[27:26.070 --> 27:29.470]  Because you can do like a light mist if you get warm
[27:29.470 --> 27:32.150]  and then you can do like the heavy stream to fill up a bottle.
[27:32.250 --> 27:32.730]  You know what I mean?
[27:33.110 --> 27:36.210]  Explain to me what you think is happening with the environment if you leave that on.
[27:38.070 --> 27:41.530]  The water is where I'm saying, hey, water, get in here.
[27:41.610 --> 27:42.910]  Keep on getting in here.
[27:43.170 --> 27:44.850]  But there's nowhere for it to go.
[27:45.070 --> 27:49.090]  Here's what can happen because this happened to me literally yesterday.
[27:49.090 --> 27:54.010]  I was giving my dog a bath because he dug a fucking hole in the yard
[27:54.010 --> 27:56.130]  and got covered in dirt and mud.
[27:56.570 --> 27:58.090]  And so I was giving my dog a bath.
[27:58.130 --> 28:02.050]  And I have one of those stupid hoses you see on TV that's all tiny.
[28:02.050 --> 28:05.490]  And then you put water and it goes like and it gets big.
[28:05.730 --> 28:07.090]  Oh, yeah, mine exploded.
[28:07.930 --> 28:09.530]  Yeah, well, I had one of those.
[28:09.570 --> 28:13.690]  And I had a little nozzle attached to the end of it that you put like dog soap in.
[28:13.770 --> 28:15.350]  Then you can spray your dog with it and stuff.
[28:15.390 --> 28:18.270]  And I set it down for a minute and I went inside to get a towel or something.
[28:18.270 --> 28:19.610]  And I came back out a few minutes later.
[28:19.810 --> 28:21.910]  And there was just water pouring everywhere.
[28:22.050 --> 28:23.610]  And my entire backyard was covered in water.
[28:23.850 --> 28:24.590]  And I couldn't figure it out.
[28:24.630 --> 28:25.630]  And I ran over and I turned it off.
[28:25.790 --> 28:27.530]  And that fucking hose exploded.
[28:27.750 --> 28:28.470]  Yours went as well?
[28:28.490 --> 28:29.530]  It just exploded.
[28:29.810 --> 28:30.790]  Yeah, just like yours did.
[28:31.110 --> 28:35.030]  And it was creating the biggest fucking mess I've ever seen in my life.
[28:35.370 --> 28:36.230]  It was crazy.
[28:36.390 --> 28:38.470]  And it had just been left on like 20 minutes.
[28:38.710 --> 28:41.550]  That's our second exploded hose tale.
[28:41.810 --> 28:43.030]  So now we've got one for each podcast.
[28:43.950 --> 28:45.030]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[28:45.530 --> 28:47.330]  I wonder whose hose is going to explode next.
[28:47.330 --> 28:50.350]  Well, hopefully not Andrew's because it will explode in his office.
[28:50.410 --> 28:54.310]  Here, I'm going to draw a design of where I think the water might be going and why it
[28:54.310 --> 28:55.630]  would be environmentally bad.
[28:55.690 --> 28:55.970]  Oh, hell yeah.
[28:59.270 --> 29:03.650]  So this is my favorite conversation we've ever had.
[29:03.850 --> 29:10.350]  The way that it started with Andrew filling up his bottle in the tub,
[29:11.390 --> 29:13.470]  to Gavin not drinking hot water,
[29:13.470 --> 29:15.170]  to now running a hose,
[29:15.310 --> 29:19.590]  and Andrew drawing a diagram about how this might not be environmentally friendly.
[29:20.670 --> 29:24.210]  I feel like we haven't lost it between podcasts.
[29:24.230 --> 29:25.750]  This is my drawing.
[29:27.670 --> 29:35.290]  I needed an image to draw on top of, so just ignore the primary point of the image.
[29:37.430 --> 29:41.270]  This is the only way I know how to draw stuff is by putting it into messenger and then
[29:41.890 --> 29:44.690]  drawing over an image that was placed.
[29:45.450 --> 29:48.470]  Hey, before we end the podcast while he's uploading this,
[29:49.250 --> 29:52.710]  we should remember to talk about the last month.
[29:52.830 --> 29:55.930]  Now that we're on the other end of it, we can like, yeah, so everything.
[29:56.010 --> 29:58.190]  We're only halfway through. We got tons of time.
[29:58.270 --> 30:00.710]  I know. I'm just giving us a little note to make sure we don't forget.
[30:01.130 --> 30:02.770]  We're like 30 minutes, dude.
[30:04.290 --> 30:05.790]  OK, so this is my drawing.
[30:05.790 --> 30:07.810]  Why do you have grey hair?
[30:08.710 --> 30:11.170]  So you've drawn on a screenshot.
[30:12.650 --> 30:16.930]  So this is, as I said, ignore the background image.
[30:17.050 --> 30:18.490]  I just, I needed something white.
[30:18.530 --> 30:19.550]  You are an animal.
[30:19.690 --> 30:20.630]  To illustrate this.
[30:20.710 --> 30:21.870]  Have you heard of cropping?
[30:22.030 --> 30:24.670]  Have you heard of just like, take your screenshot of something white?
[30:24.730 --> 30:27.850]  We're on a podcast and I didn't have time to crop.
[30:27.970 --> 30:30.110]  Take a picture of the damn wall and draw it that way.
[30:30.690 --> 30:32.050]  Well, I did it.
[30:32.250 --> 30:33.190]  It doesn't matter.
[30:33.590 --> 30:34.370]  Just ignore it.
[30:35.210 --> 30:37.390]  I'm more interested in you just drew an L.
[30:38.070 --> 30:40.570]  Yeah, so this is this is what I'm thinking, right?
[30:40.790 --> 30:43.890]  So I twist the thing and I say, hey, water, get in here.
[30:44.050 --> 30:48.470]  Come in here and you see the light green line.
[30:48.610 --> 30:50.670]  Yeah, that's the hose.
[30:50.950 --> 30:56.110]  So the water is going up the hose and it's not going out because I have the thing saying,
[30:56.170 --> 30:57.570]  hey, don't get out of here.
[30:57.710 --> 31:00.410]  So the left side is the user end.
[31:00.410 --> 31:01.970]  Yes, that's the user.
[31:02.110 --> 31:08.110]  And that would be where I could flip the nozzle or the switch and the water goes and fires.
[31:08.950 --> 31:13.070]  What I don't know is, does the water continue to flow?
[31:13.130 --> 31:16.490]  And because it continues to flow, obviously it can't flow further into the hose.
[31:16.550 --> 31:17.930]  Because there's no room.
[31:18.770 --> 31:19.210]  Does it?
[31:19.690 --> 31:21.390]  Well, I don't know where when I.
[31:21.570 --> 31:22.710]  OK, so let me ask you this.
[31:23.330 --> 31:23.730]  Yeah.
[31:23.850 --> 31:25.030]  When you've got like a tap.
[31:25.830 --> 31:29.010]  And yeah, you got an outdoor tap usually has a hose on it.
[31:29.530 --> 31:29.930]  Yeah.
[31:29.930 --> 31:30.750]  Take the hose off.
[31:30.810 --> 31:31.390]  Forget about the hose.
[31:32.230 --> 31:33.770]  There's water pressure, right?
[31:34.210 --> 31:35.590]  It wants to leave the tap.
[31:36.050 --> 31:39.570]  But your tap, if you turn it off, it just it blocks.
[31:39.850 --> 31:40.630]  It blocks the water.
[31:41.430 --> 31:42.410]  Yeah, you're just doing that.
[31:42.810 --> 31:43.890]  But further up.
[31:44.610 --> 31:51.630]  Well, no, I so when I look at when I look at an outside water tap, right?
[31:52.030 --> 31:57.670]  When I look at a tap, I know that if I twist that nozzle, that means water comes out.
[31:57.670 --> 32:00.610]  I don't know what's happening behind that.
[32:00.750 --> 32:03.010]  But you're not making water from that.
[32:03.230 --> 32:05.250]  Do you know how a nozzle works?
[32:05.730 --> 32:08.350]  No, I have no idea how a nozzle works.
[32:08.570 --> 32:10.050]  That's like a door, man.
[32:10.250 --> 32:12.250]  It's just a fucking water door.
[32:12.490 --> 32:14.030]  All it does is open and close.
[32:15.390 --> 32:18.510]  It just opens a hole in the pipe to allow the water.
[32:18.510 --> 32:19.670]  So the water is always going.
[32:19.670 --> 32:20.690]  The water is at the door.
[32:20.970 --> 32:21.810]  It's like Hodor.
[32:22.010 --> 32:23.750]  The water is at the door the whole time.
[32:24.230 --> 32:25.690]  And the and the spigot is Hodor.
[32:25.990 --> 32:27.130]  And he's just holding the door.
[32:27.130 --> 32:28.110]  He's holding the water back.
[32:28.170 --> 32:32.570]  And he's holding the water back so that all the fucking the wildlings or whoever can fucking escape.
[32:33.250 --> 32:37.130]  And and then every once in a while you turn the hose and Hodor lets the water out.
[32:37.410 --> 32:43.770]  The only way it's bad for the environment is if Hodor is kind of weak and he's leaking a little.
[32:44.230 --> 32:44.410]  Yeah.
[32:44.550 --> 32:47.170]  Okay, so as long as there's no leak.
[32:47.590 --> 32:53.290]  You just got to make sure Hodor has all of his, uh, what do you call those little platelets, little
[32:53.290 --> 32:54.290]  rubber rings?
[32:54.670 --> 32:55.530]  Yeah, his seals.
[32:55.530 --> 32:57.330]  You gotta make sure his o-rings are in place.
[32:57.430 --> 32:57.990]  His o-rings.
[32:58.510 --> 32:59.370]  His ho-rings.
[32:59.510 --> 32:59.790]  His ho-rings.
[32:59.790 --> 32:59.970]  His ho-rings.
[33:04.450 --> 33:05.510]  This is stupid.
[33:05.590 --> 33:06.950]  It'd be nice if they did a brittle hose.
[33:08.550 --> 33:10.830]  Maybe you need to reinvent the hose, Andrew.
[33:11.050 --> 33:11.890]  Maybe, maybe that's...
[33:11.890 --> 33:12.350]  No, I don't.
[33:12.910 --> 33:13.170]  Okay.
[33:13.410 --> 33:14.830]  I don't understand any of this.
[33:15.130 --> 33:17.590]  I was gonna say you wanted to reinvent the hose.
[33:17.670 --> 33:19.530]  You don't know how, like, a faucet works.
[33:19.690 --> 33:20.050]  Yeah.
[33:20.050 --> 33:21.090]  What are you talking about?
[33:21.230 --> 33:22.530]  You could rig that up, Andrew.
[33:22.690 --> 33:22.950]  You could...
[33:22.950 --> 33:26.070]  How far is the kitchen from where you're sitting?
[33:27.150 --> 33:27.650]  Uh, it's...
[33:27.650 --> 33:28.170]  Well, that's...
[33:29.690 --> 33:30.130]  Uh...
[33:30.130 --> 33:31.070]  Does the kitchen have a window?
[33:31.930 --> 33:32.290]  Oh, I...
[33:32.290 --> 33:34.630]  Nah, well, it's summer, the flies, I can't...
[33:35.490 --> 33:36.410]  There's a door.
[33:36.950 --> 33:40.690]  I can run it from one door to another door.
[33:40.870 --> 33:41.450]  On the inside?
[33:42.050 --> 33:43.610]  Well, there's patios.
[33:44.390 --> 33:44.830]  Okay.
[33:44.890 --> 33:45.970]  There's a patio situation.
[33:46.350 --> 33:47.050]  And then could you...
[33:49.110 --> 33:51.950]  Okay, so Jeff just posted an image of how this works.
[33:51.950 --> 33:55.270]  So where does the water go at the bottom?
[33:55.590 --> 33:56.470]  It's just not gonna help.
[33:56.610 --> 33:58.270]  It's just there. It doesn't go anywhere.
[33:58.490 --> 34:01.010]  It's just hanging out there. It's pushing up against the door.
[34:01.630 --> 34:06.690]  That's that little red screw. That's Hodor, man.
[34:07.050 --> 34:11.130]  It's water pressure from the water company.
[34:12.010 --> 34:12.890]  Yeah, but...
[34:12.890 --> 34:13.810]  Well, wait, the wat...
[34:13.810 --> 34:15.510]  Wait, the company...
[34:15.510 --> 34:17.710]  The water company is providing pressure?
[34:17.710 --> 34:21.030]  Well, I assume the reservoir or whatever water management
[34:21.550 --> 34:23.930]  thing at the other end of the pipe is pushing water.
[34:24.550 --> 34:26.610]  Okay, so let's say I don't pay my water bill.
[34:27.090 --> 34:30.350]  When they shut off my water, what are they doing?
[34:30.750 --> 34:33.370]  They go out to the street in front of your house
[34:33.370 --> 34:38.150]  where there is a shut-off valve, and they shut it off at the street so that...
[34:38.150 --> 34:43.010]  They Hodor it right there, and then so the water can't even get to your...
[34:43.010 --> 34:45.550]  Yeah, it's all it is. It's a series of doors and pipes.
[34:45.550 --> 34:48.490]  What is stopping you from just going out there and turning it back on?
[34:49.230 --> 34:51.090]  With that big, long thing.
[34:52.270 --> 34:54.330]  They might lock it or something, I don't know.
[34:54.790 --> 34:58.450]  Also, probably it's against the law, I would assume.
[34:59.050 --> 34:59.630]  Stealing water.
[34:59.670 --> 35:02.790]  I don't even know where I'd find it. I assumed it was in my house, to be honest.
[35:03.090 --> 35:04.270]  Most people don't know where to find it.
[35:04.310 --> 35:05.390]  There's a bunch of them in your house.
[35:05.630 --> 35:09.290]  There's one under your sink that you can turn off right now.
[35:10.150 --> 35:12.810]  There's all kinds of doors along a water pipe.
[35:12.990 --> 35:14.350]  There's one right next to the toilet.
[35:14.350 --> 35:16.330]  Yeah, there's one behind the toilet.
[35:16.590 --> 35:18.990]  There's one next to every faucet.
[35:19.510 --> 35:22.910]  There's one at the faucet and five feet in front of the faucet.
[35:23.190 --> 35:24.230]  And everywhere in your house.
[35:24.750 --> 35:30.230]  How do they make sure that the water pressure isn't so much that it pushes in the door?
[35:31.750 --> 35:33.050]  How is that prevented?
[35:33.730 --> 35:34.190]  Science.
[35:35.490 --> 35:36.650]  Great. Okay, thanks.
[35:36.730 --> 35:43.050]  Well, a lot of valves can be closed like from the pressure, like the pressure keeps them closed.
[35:43.050 --> 35:45.230]  And then you have to push them open.
[35:45.790 --> 35:51.130]  A thing that we have happen in Austin that I've never had happen before I moved here
[35:51.130 --> 35:57.690]  is that so much water gets into the treatment plant when it rains
[35:57.690 --> 36:01.730]  that they can't clean it in time for it to get to you, Andrew.
[36:02.270 --> 36:06.990]  So we have a boil notice and for like 10 days you have to boil your water
[36:06.990 --> 36:08.950]  because it makes it not potable.
[36:09.550 --> 36:11.990]  Yes, it's overwhelmed by the amount of water.
[36:11.990 --> 36:15.210]  Yes, exactly. So it's a very intricate system.
[36:15.370 --> 36:17.190]  Water is an intricate series of doors.
[36:17.750 --> 36:18.530]  Yeah, it is.
[36:18.690 --> 36:20.870]  But when God says more, then we're fucked.
[36:21.130 --> 36:24.070]  And sometimes it's too full of bacteria from people's butts.
[36:25.090 --> 36:29.330]  And all this shit, all of this shit the Romans figured out
[36:29.330 --> 36:32.470]  thousands of years ago without any electricity or technology.
[36:33.190 --> 36:35.590]  That's crazy. I don't believe that.
[36:36.190 --> 36:36.870]  You should.
[36:37.610 --> 36:38.530]  Well, I do believe it.
[36:38.530 --> 36:40.410]  Let me be clear.
[36:40.610 --> 36:42.070]  I'm not saying what you're saying is a lie.
[36:42.330 --> 36:44.350]  I'm not a water conspiracy theorist.
[36:44.450 --> 36:45.570]  I just it's crazy.
[36:45.850 --> 36:49.530]  I want to just go around your house with you.
[36:50.210 --> 36:52.230]  I'd just point at stuff and be like, how does that work?
[36:54.250 --> 36:55.570]  Yeah, no, you can do that.
[36:56.790 --> 36:58.170]  Light switches, I got no idea.
[36:58.650 --> 37:00.290]  That would be a great supplemental series.
[37:01.270 --> 37:02.450]  Andrew explains things.
[37:03.050 --> 37:04.530]  You know, what's funny is I've swapped.
[37:04.530 --> 37:08.770]  I've like installed dimmers before, but I don't know how any of it works.
[37:09.430 --> 37:13.190]  Like I've put in new new switches, but I don't know.
[37:13.470 --> 37:15.850]  I'm going to go ahead and say that you shouldn't ever do that.
[37:16.190 --> 37:17.430]  Yeah, no, I know how to do it.
[37:17.470 --> 37:20.330]  You turn the breaker off, you unscrew it, you loop the loops.
[37:20.770 --> 37:23.990]  But you know, it's really not that different from water.
[37:24.570 --> 37:26.270]  It's the breakers are just doors.
[37:26.730 --> 37:27.510]  It's all doors.
[37:27.790 --> 37:29.670]  Opening and closing electric current.
[37:29.890 --> 37:34.230]  Yeah, I think in Australia, you're not allowed to do your own.
[37:35.550 --> 37:35.950]  Electricianing.
[37:36.950 --> 37:37.350]  Really?
[37:37.710 --> 37:38.010]  Yeah.
[37:38.950 --> 37:40.770]  What if you are an electrician?
[37:40.850 --> 37:41.710]  Then I think it's fine.
[37:42.510 --> 37:42.910]  Okay.
[37:44.110 --> 37:47.850]  It'd be a weird rule if you were an electrician and you had to hire somebody else.
[37:47.970 --> 37:49.930]  You had to hire someone at the place you work.
[37:50.350 --> 37:51.670]  How are your dimmers, by the way?
[37:52.510 --> 37:55.910]  I haven't had a dimmer in a long time, but I have installed them in the past.
[37:56.030 --> 37:56.970]  And then they've always worked.
[37:57.450 --> 37:57.750]  Sweet.
[37:58.470 --> 37:58.870]  Never.
[37:59.230 --> 38:02.250]  I've never had a fire related to dimmers.
[38:02.670 --> 38:04.330]  Just related to desk dogs.
[38:04.870 --> 38:05.530]  Desk dogs.
[38:05.670 --> 38:06.690]  Yeah, that's a problem.
[38:07.910 --> 38:09.370]  I'm trying to think of any other fires.
[38:09.630 --> 38:13.630]  I think the hose in the window of the room you're in now,
[38:13.710 --> 38:16.170]  I think that's going to do wonders for you if you set that up.
[38:16.270 --> 38:17.450]  I think you'll love that.
[38:18.090 --> 38:18.370]  Yeah.
[38:19.290 --> 38:21.150]  I'm worried someone's going to steal the hose.
[38:23.630 --> 38:25.530]  Because I had my doorbell stolen.
[38:26.150 --> 38:27.570]  And how are they going to steal it?
[38:27.630 --> 38:33.410]  Like if you see the hose starting to pull backwards towards the window, just grab it.
[38:33.410 --> 38:35.810]  And then you get to play a fun game of tug-of-war with a thief.
[38:35.950 --> 38:39.850]  Attach a bell to it on the other end so you can hear it being stolen.
[38:40.310 --> 38:42.310]  Tie it around a table leg.
[38:42.870 --> 38:47.530]  No, I'm going to be laying in my bed with my headphones on,
[38:48.010 --> 38:50.110]  with a waterfall going out of my head.
[38:50.170 --> 38:54.190]  I'm not hearing my hose getting stolen, no matter the amount of bells.
[38:54.390 --> 38:56.770]  Imagine if someone stole it while you were using it.
[38:59.190 --> 39:00.890]  This gets ripped out of your head.
[39:01.810 --> 39:03.690]  Water just shooting everywhere.
[39:07.670 --> 39:09.210]  Oh, you've got to do this, Andrew.
[39:10.950 --> 39:12.690]  I'll evaluate and I'll see.
[39:12.870 --> 39:14.750]  Yeah, it would be a really long hose.
[39:14.970 --> 39:18.170]  It's going to solve so many problems you didn't even know you had.
[39:18.250 --> 39:20.330]  Just think of all the unintended benefits.
[39:21.670 --> 39:22.690]  I'm trying to think.
[39:23.530 --> 39:25.670]  Like you won't even know it until in the moment.
[39:25.790 --> 39:26.690]  Then you'll be like, oh, you know what?
[39:26.730 --> 39:28.290]  You know what? It would be great if I had a hose.
[39:28.290 --> 39:28.830]  I do.
[39:29.010 --> 39:30.990]  And then you're going to be like, oh, this is a chalk.
[39:31.050 --> 39:32.230]  Another one up for a good idea.
[39:32.690 --> 39:36.150]  You'll be so much more hydrated as well, because I feel like sometimes you might be
[39:36.150 --> 39:39.130]  feeling a bit thirsty, but then you're just like, nah, yeah.
[39:39.590 --> 39:43.050]  And the nice thing about a hose is it can put that water in you fast.
[39:44.270 --> 39:48.630]  OK, so realistically, a good use of this would be and I just can't.
[39:49.390 --> 39:50.290]  I think it's a bad idea.
[39:50.350 --> 39:51.110]  I'm not supposed to.
[39:51.370 --> 39:56.570]  But an inflatable hot tub would be great on the patio and it would be very tight.
[39:56.790 --> 39:58.170]  There'd not be a lot of room for it.
[39:58.170 --> 39:59.970]  I'm not supposed to do something like that.
[39:59.970 --> 40:01.210]  Are you talking like on your balcony?
[40:01.830 --> 40:04.170]  Yeah. Yeah, that'd be real nice.
[40:04.450 --> 40:07.350]  You think you can support the weight of a hot tub?
[40:07.750 --> 40:09.210]  An inflatable hot tub.
[40:09.510 --> 40:14.530]  Yes. Well, most of the weight is going to be in the water, probably, I would think.
[40:15.430 --> 40:17.390]  Well, you know, they're pretty big as well.
[40:17.750 --> 40:18.630]  I see what you're saying.
[40:18.770 --> 40:19.870]  What's below your balcony?
[40:20.370 --> 40:21.110]  Another balcony.
[40:21.910 --> 40:24.430]  Yeah, you might want to warn them to be very wet.
[40:24.670 --> 40:25.710]  But it's my balcony.
[40:26.410 --> 40:27.970]  Oh, oh, you're fine.
[40:27.970 --> 40:29.450]  Well, you should warn yourself.
[40:29.810 --> 40:33.170]  I do want to note that full of water and people,
[40:33.370 --> 40:37.030]  inflatable hot tubs can easily weigh up to 2500 pounds.
[40:37.190 --> 40:42.050]  So just do less people and a little less water down to about 2k and you're good, dude.
[40:42.250 --> 40:44.150]  Do you do do you happen to know?
[40:44.310 --> 40:48.110]  Can your balcony support the weight of a car?
[40:48.470 --> 40:49.690]  Because that's about what that is.
[40:50.170 --> 40:51.610]  Why wouldn't it be able to?
[40:52.050 --> 40:52.950]  I don't know.
[40:53.910 --> 40:56.790]  If you think it can support a car, then it's like if you could
[40:56.790 --> 41:01.610]  if you could put like a Nissan Sentra on it, I think you can put a hot tub.
[41:02.390 --> 41:06.750]  I think I yeah, I think I'm probably just a bad read on that in my head.
[41:07.430 --> 41:08.130]  It's sturdy.
[41:08.390 --> 41:12.390]  Is it held up by like beams from below or is it just hanging out of the side of the building?
[41:12.990 --> 41:15.030]  I think it's just hanging out of the side of the building.
[41:15.270 --> 41:16.250]  You know what you could do?
[41:16.530 --> 41:19.870]  You could get some chains and you could loop them to the balcony.
[41:20.010 --> 41:20.870]  Is there anything above you?
[41:20.930 --> 41:21.310]  Here we go.
[41:21.490 --> 41:23.430]  Yeah, just the roof.
[41:23.810 --> 41:24.870]  Here's what you do with the chain.
[41:24.990 --> 41:25.330]  Perfect.
[41:25.330 --> 41:28.230]  You get the change, you loop them up to the roof and then you winch that.
[41:28.290 --> 41:28.930]  So it's secure.
[41:29.110 --> 41:30.610]  And now you've got extra support.
[41:30.970 --> 41:31.490]  Forget the roof.
[41:31.750 --> 41:34.830]  Put the chains, hurl them straight over the top of the building.
[41:34.950 --> 41:39.010]  So they hang down on the other side and hold up a balcony on that side, too.
[41:39.770 --> 41:40.490]  Perfect idea.
[41:40.510 --> 41:41.850]  So they're holding each other up.
[41:42.450 --> 41:44.170]  Yeah, you don't even need chains for that.
[41:44.230 --> 41:45.190]  You could do nylon rope.
[41:45.250 --> 41:46.050]  Probably that would hold.
[41:46.570 --> 41:48.830]  What is the weight capacity of the average balcony?
[41:50.390 --> 41:55.230]  Dude, we had an incident a couple of years ago in Austin.
[41:55.230 --> 41:58.770]  Maybe 12 years ago where a bunch of people were having a party
[41:58.770 --> 42:01.350]  on a balcony on this fucking house over on the east side.
[42:01.410 --> 42:02.610]  And it was on the second floor.
[42:02.690 --> 42:05.790]  And they were like 40 people on the balcony when it collapsed.
[42:06.430 --> 42:09.790]  And there was a lot of a lot of people got like not severely, but
[42:10.310 --> 42:12.250]  you know, decently fucked up from it.
[42:13.710 --> 42:17.170]  I I have an answer immediately of generally speaking, balconies
[42:17.170 --> 42:20.350]  are load rated to 50 to 100 pounds per square foot.
[42:20.710 --> 42:24.970]  And then immediately and people also ask, can my balcony hold a hot tub?
[42:26.110 --> 42:27.010]  Oh, well, there you go.
[42:27.130 --> 42:32.450]  And the answer is almost always the best choice and most can hold a small hot tub.
[42:32.910 --> 42:36.170]  Most high rise apartments and condos, a balcony is built with reinforced steel
[42:36.170 --> 42:39.290]  and cement, which will not be damaged by steam.
[42:39.990 --> 42:40.570]  There's another one.
[42:40.630 --> 42:43.070]  Our balcony strong, which I just I love that.
[42:43.150 --> 42:45.330]  It's like what a dumb, dumb guy.
[42:45.470 --> 42:46.690]  Our balcony strong.
[42:48.290 --> 42:50.930]  So it's like 100 foot pounds per square foot.
[42:51.010 --> 42:52.070]  So I could figure it out.
[42:52.390 --> 42:53.370]  I do the math on this.
[42:53.450 --> 42:54.410]  I can measure it.
[42:54.410 --> 42:59.350]  Did you see the the comment leaver that posted this picture?
[43:01.730 --> 43:02.490]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[43:08.690 --> 43:09.590]  It is.
[43:11.870 --> 43:13.530]  An Achievement Hunter logo.
[43:16.470 --> 43:18.650]  Well, not let me actually rephrase that.
[43:18.730 --> 43:19.990]  It is not an Achievement Hunter logo.
[43:19.990 --> 43:27.990]  It is a green circular face symbol with regulation podcast logo,
[43:29.190 --> 43:30.470]  which happens to be the.
[43:31.350 --> 43:33.830]  Oh, yeah, we changed her name.
[43:34.090 --> 43:34.410]  Sorry.
[43:36.150 --> 43:38.970]  The lineage in that image is hilarious.
[43:39.610 --> 43:42.970]  I think that needs to be more like sequel things like that.
[43:43.230 --> 43:43.510]  Yeah.
[43:43.970 --> 43:47.790]  If the background was was red on one side and blue on the other,
[43:47.790 --> 43:50.830]  instead of all black, Jeff, we just have your whole situation.
[43:53.810 --> 43:56.650]  Like there's my entire adult life in 300 pixels.
[43:57.650 --> 43:58.630]  Oh, my God.
[43:59.690 --> 44:02.310]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[44:02.690 --> 44:05.950]  Checking off the boxes on your to do list is a great feeling.
[44:06.190 --> 44:08.190]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[44:08.390 --> 44:11.610]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[44:11.790 --> 44:16.070]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone or using the award winning app.
[44:16.070 --> 44:19.810]  It's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[44:20.250 --> 44:22.070]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[44:25.240 --> 44:26.560]  Hey, it's Paris.
[44:27.020 --> 44:29.140]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[44:29.360 --> 44:30.180]  Like stars.
[44:30.620 --> 44:30.900]  Duh.
[44:31.400 --> 44:35.040]  And thanks to Hilton and Auto Camp, I just slept under them.
[44:35.660 --> 44:39.940]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious airstream,
[44:40.420 --> 44:44.680]  making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop.
[44:45.240 --> 44:47.700]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[44:48.220 --> 44:48.940]  That's hot.
[44:49.580 --> 44:52.620]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[44:53.000 --> 44:54.340]  Hilton for the stay.
[44:54.880 --> 44:57.700]  There weren't enough sequel bands, I think.
[44:58.880 --> 45:00.840]  Sequel bands? Like B-A-N-D-S?
[45:01.360 --> 45:04.320]  Yeah, like you had Jefferson Airplane.
[45:04.880 --> 45:06.980]  And then Jefferson Starship.
[45:07.220 --> 45:08.400]  And then Starship.
[45:08.540 --> 45:11.700]  It's like you can see every iteration.
[45:11.700 --> 45:15.780]  There was Oingo Boingo, and then they were just Boingo, I believe.
[45:16.600 --> 45:17.940]  I'm not joking, I'm serious.
[45:18.060 --> 45:21.320]  Yeah, I think they became just Boingo at some point.
[45:23.380 --> 45:24.180]  Any other ones?
[45:24.340 --> 45:25.200]  What other ones?
[45:26.040 --> 45:29.500]  Would you consider, does every member have to be, can it just,
[45:29.620 --> 45:32.860]  like how many members have to be in the new band for it to be considered a sequel?
[45:33.160 --> 45:36.040]  Like, would you consider the Foo Fighters to be a sequel of Nirvana?
[45:36.680 --> 45:39.060]  No, I think it needs to be 51% or more.
[45:39.900 --> 45:43.060]  Yeah, it sort of turns into like a ship of Theseus, doesn't it?
[45:43.940 --> 45:48.220]  You're taking out boards, I guess, band members and replacing them with other ones.
[45:48.300 --> 45:51.960]  Well, there's a lot of bands out there that exist right now that are that.
[45:53.200 --> 45:56.100]  Zero surviving original members, still going strong.
[45:56.240 --> 45:58.940]  It's crazy when that happens, like Human League in the 80s,
[45:58.980 --> 46:00.320]  I think before they got really popular,
[46:00.660 --> 46:02.680]  all the original members of the band had left.
[46:02.840 --> 46:04.420]  So by the time that they got popular,
[46:04.460 --> 46:06.900]  it was just a bunch of people that didn't start Human League.
[46:07.460 --> 46:10.660]  It's like, oh, that doesn't make any sense. That's crazy.
[46:11.200 --> 46:15.680]  I don't think any of the original members of GWAR are alive.
[46:16.400 --> 46:18.800]  Wild. That's crazy.
[46:20.480 --> 46:23.960]  There's definitely not a single original member in that band,
[46:24.020 --> 46:29.070]  but I think maybe one of the last original member died this year or last year.
[46:29.070 --> 46:29.950]  Oh, wow.
[46:32.210 --> 46:36.410]  Circling back to cool Achievement Hunter regulation podcast logo,
[46:36.670 --> 46:41.110]  we should talk about what's been going on since like over like the last month
[46:41.110 --> 46:44.930]  and sort of before that to how we came to be
[46:44.930 --> 46:48.350]  and how we have all of our RSS feed stuff and everything set and settled.
[46:49.170 --> 46:52.690]  I agree. Can we can we do that?
[46:52.910 --> 46:55.830]  Can I loop up music before I have one more music thing?
[46:55.910 --> 46:56.790]  Oh, please say.
[46:56.790 --> 46:57.710]  Oh, yeah, I didn't get.
[46:57.890 --> 47:01.970]  I had I had a big I had a whole thing recently.
[47:02.510 --> 47:06.810]  Do you ever on like your TikTok feed or whatever or whatever your feed is?
[47:07.150 --> 47:11.710]  You ever just get like it decides randomly that you're going to get 50 versions of one thing
[47:12.130 --> 47:15.830]  like you've done nothing to influence it, but it's just like the algorithm is like,
[47:15.890 --> 47:17.490]  hey, you need to watch this.
[47:17.930 --> 47:19.050]  This is your thing to watch.
[47:19.590 --> 47:21.110]  Is that something that I've only experienced?
[47:21.950 --> 47:22.170]  No.
[47:23.350 --> 47:24.290]  Great. Thank you.
[47:24.770 --> 47:26.450]  Good assistance. Good teamwork, y'all.
[47:26.990 --> 47:29.090]  Episode four, it feels like it.
[47:29.090 --> 47:30.510]  Yeah, no, I was just I was confirming.
[47:31.470 --> 47:32.110]  Yeah, I agree.
[47:32.290 --> 47:33.050]  That was fun.
[47:33.210 --> 47:34.090]  But there's silence.
[47:34.150 --> 47:35.090]  I had to wait for that.
[47:35.230 --> 47:37.170]  I want because then if there wasn't, I'd explain further.
[47:37.590 --> 47:39.590]  I definitely call into the silence.
[47:40.950 --> 47:46.470]  Randomly, for some reason, TikTok decided I needed to see a live performance of Macklemore
[47:46.470 --> 47:51.150]  doing downtown one day, and I got like 10 different things of it.
[47:51.330 --> 47:54.850]  And that is not that is a song I haven't thought about in a very long time.
[47:54.970 --> 47:55.490]  How does it go?
[47:56.350 --> 48:02.410]  It's like downtown down, and then they yell town a lot.
[48:02.450 --> 48:06.410]  And there's something about leather and legs.
[48:06.490 --> 48:06.910]  I don't know.
[48:07.130 --> 48:12.670]  Anyway, I always thought that the person who did the chorus of that song was the best part
[48:12.670 --> 48:13.290]  of that song.
[48:13.630 --> 48:14.450]  I don't know their name.
[48:14.730 --> 48:15.870]  I don't know anything about them.
[48:16.150 --> 48:20.730]  But because I kept getting them on TikTok performing with Macklemore, I thought I should
[48:20.730 --> 48:23.550]  look into this person and see what they've done.
[48:24.010 --> 48:25.150]  I don't know anything about them.
[48:25.490 --> 48:30.590]  So I did some research and I guess they're the lead singer of a band called Foxy Shazam.
[48:31.050 --> 48:32.870]  Does anyone here heard of Foxy Shazam?
[48:33.410 --> 48:35.190]  No, no, no.
[48:35.250 --> 48:38.590]  I had zero point of reference, but I'm not the biggest music guy, so I didn't know anything
[48:38.590 --> 48:39.050]  about them.
[48:39.310 --> 48:45.450]  So I put Foxy Shazam into YouTube and I thought, I'll just listen to some of their songs
[48:45.450 --> 48:47.310]  because I've never explored this.
[48:47.610 --> 48:49.590]  I like what the guy did in downtown.
[48:50.470 --> 48:51.670]  I'm interested to see.
[48:51.790 --> 48:54.230]  So I go through the first one and it's like, that's fine, whatever.
[48:54.710 --> 49:00.410]  And then it was crazy because the second song I listened to, I realized I've heard this
[49:00.410 --> 49:02.490]  song like 10,000 times.
[49:02.610 --> 49:04.770]  I had no idea it was him or was associated.
[49:05.210 --> 49:11.370]  It was one of the songs in NHL 13, which is a game that I played so much the UI burnt
[49:11.370 --> 49:12.230]  into my television.
[49:12.450 --> 49:18.510]  Like I spent thousands of hours making fake Vancouver Canucks teams in NHL 13.
[49:18.710 --> 49:23.830]  I love that game and it was crazy to think, oh, this guy that I was aware of, but thought
[49:23.830 --> 49:30.010]  I had no connection to, did a song that I've heard like 10,000 times and I had no idea.
[49:30.130 --> 49:31.630]  I immediately recognized it.
[49:31.870 --> 49:33.050]  I was having a great time.
[49:33.210 --> 49:34.930]  I'm going to post the lyrics.
[49:36.110 --> 49:39.870]  And so Foxy Shazam is one of your most listened to artists, probably.
[49:40.250 --> 49:42.850]  It is one of my most listened to artists and I didn't even know it.
[49:43.130 --> 49:44.010]  Here are the lyrics.
[49:44.350 --> 49:45.950]  If someone wants to read them.
[49:46.670 --> 49:48.770]  So come on, come on, come on, come on.
[49:49.090 --> 49:50.150]  Show me a little more.
[49:50.450 --> 49:51.590]  Come on, come on, come on.
[49:51.810 --> 49:52.470]  I like it.
[49:52.710 --> 49:53.350]  I like it.
[49:53.830 --> 49:54.530]  I like it.
[49:54.810 --> 49:56.790]  I like it a lot.
[49:57.210 --> 49:58.910]  That's the chorus of that song.
[49:59.050 --> 50:03.730]  And so I'm listening to it and I'm like, that's this is take me back to the old days.
[50:03.730 --> 50:06.270]  Yeah, I'll play in NHL 13.
[50:06.910 --> 50:10.830]  But then, then we had a little bit of blindside.
[50:12.330 --> 50:13.430]  Jeff, could you?
[50:13.750 --> 50:15.810]  I'll interject with the addition.
[50:16.970 --> 50:19.770]  Okay, let me let me post these.
[50:19.850 --> 50:20.970]  I just lost my page.
[50:22.010 --> 50:24.470]  I fumbled this tremendously.
[50:25.730 --> 50:28.070]  But I like lead singer of this band.
[50:28.430 --> 50:28.910]  Okay.
[50:29.590 --> 50:30.730]  Is named Eric.
[50:31.350 --> 50:34.390]  This is I felt like I was getting blindsided by Eric when this happened.
[50:35.990 --> 50:36.790]  Oh, fuck.
[50:38.490 --> 50:40.030]  Oh, wait, no, what's happening?
[50:40.470 --> 50:42.250]  I just got lost on the tab here.
[50:42.330 --> 50:42.650]  Here we go.
[50:42.670 --> 50:43.130]  Okay, ready?
[50:44.310 --> 50:44.910]  Read it, Jeff.
[50:44.910 --> 50:46.770]  And then when there's an addition, I'll cut in.
[50:47.230 --> 50:50.630]  So are the additions in the just read the lyrics?
[50:51.230 --> 50:52.450]  I'm just gonna read it.
[50:52.590 --> 50:52.670]  Okay.
[50:53.430 --> 50:54.470]  Oh, come on.
[50:54.590 --> 50:56.150]  Come on, come on, come on.
[50:56.190 --> 50:57.350]  Show me a little more.
[50:57.590 --> 50:59.070]  Come on, come on, come on.
[50:59.150 --> 51:01.310]  That's the biggest black ass I've ever seen.
[51:01.710 --> 51:02.670]  And I like it.
[51:02.750 --> 51:03.610]  I like it.
[51:04.310 --> 51:06.630]  That's the biggest black ass I've ever seen.
[51:07.050 --> 51:08.010]  And I like it.
[51:08.110 --> 51:09.290]  I like it a lot.
[51:09.970 --> 51:11.190]  Canucks playoff meta.
[51:12.030 --> 51:14.010]  Yeah, that was part of my notes.
[51:15.690 --> 51:17.050]  Completely unrelated to that.
[51:17.050 --> 51:21.030]  But I had no idea that song was about big black asses.
[51:21.350 --> 51:22.450]  I've heard that song.
[51:22.550 --> 51:25.290]  They edited that out of NHL 13.
[51:25.530 --> 51:34.290]  The version that you said at the top was how I have known that song for like 12 years.
[51:34.550 --> 51:35.950]  So it's like an edited...
[51:35.950 --> 51:38.470]  So it just skips lines in the song?
[51:38.630 --> 51:39.930]  Or have they like re-recorded it?
[51:40.390 --> 51:42.230]  No, so they just edited it.
[51:42.270 --> 51:45.530]  But it's not a popular enough song to have a radio edit.
[51:45.530 --> 51:50.430]  So the only version that's like that is in NHL 13.
[51:50.430 --> 51:52.590]  And it's not in any other games.
[51:53.230 --> 51:55.150]  So I was trying to record it.
[51:55.250 --> 51:59.970]  I ordered a copy of NHL 13 so I could clip the version that I've heard.
[52:00.230 --> 52:01.410]  And I'll get that eventually.
[52:01.910 --> 52:07.490]  But I was stunned at like 1am listening to this when it cut into black asses.
[52:07.570 --> 52:08.510]  I had no idea.
[52:09.290 --> 52:12.470]  It blew my mind that that is what this song is about.
[52:13.990 --> 52:16.390]  I never really paid attention to the lyrics to begin with,
[52:16.470 --> 52:18.550]  but I was like, I would have noticed that.
[52:19.550 --> 52:20.250]  It's yellow.
[52:20.590 --> 52:21.670]  That must have been so...
[52:21.670 --> 52:24.330]  Because that kind of stuff, when you've seen something a billion times
[52:24.330 --> 52:27.570]  and then you see like the unedited version, it's so jarring.
[52:27.910 --> 52:29.810]  Were you like gobsmacked by that?
[52:29.910 --> 52:30.990]  I couldn't believe it.
[52:31.110 --> 52:33.950]  I was more shocked than when all the Boba pearls flew into my mouth.
[52:34.070 --> 52:36.890]  It was... I truly felt blindsided.
[52:37.210 --> 52:38.530]  So which version do you like more?
[52:40.110 --> 52:41.550]  I don't know if I have a pick.
[52:41.550 --> 52:46.650]  I'm still processing my feelings that I feel like I've been lied to for the past 12 years.
[52:46.650 --> 52:49.050]  Did you feel like you were in a bizarro world for a second?
[52:50.390 --> 52:54.450]  Or did you immediately understand what happened and clock it?
[52:54.490 --> 52:58.090]  Or did it take you a second to figure out, like, am I being Mandela affected right now?
[52:58.150 --> 52:59.370]  No, I immediately...
[52:59.370 --> 53:00.290]  Do I have false memories?
[53:00.970 --> 53:04.410]  Only because I had played that game, as I said, for so many hours.
[53:04.410 --> 53:06.610]  Like the fact it was burned into my television.
[53:07.070 --> 53:08.150]  I know that song.
[53:08.150 --> 53:10.710]  I know every song on that game.
[53:11.210 --> 53:13.410]  It's just... it stunned me.
[53:13.710 --> 53:16.130]  It never even occurred to me it could be a radio edit.
[53:16.350 --> 53:18.950]  And the fact that it was, and that's what was edited out.
[53:19.070 --> 53:20.010]  But not even a radio edit.
[53:20.310 --> 53:22.110]  They just chose not to include that.
[53:22.710 --> 53:25.890]  Do you think there are people who have only heard the Black Eyed Peas singing,
[53:26.050 --> 53:26.810]  Let's Get It Started?
[53:27.530 --> 53:28.270]  Oh, absolutely.
[53:28.650 --> 53:30.010]  I would say a lot of people.
[53:31.910 --> 53:32.310]  100%.
[53:32.310 --> 53:32.970]  Yeah.
[53:33.110 --> 53:33.990]  I thought you were going to say...
[53:33.990 --> 53:40.870]  I'm curious how many people have only heard that song through NHL 13 like I have to this point.
[53:41.030 --> 53:42.230]  Probably a lot, dude.
[53:42.650 --> 53:43.250]  And are shocked.
[53:43.510 --> 53:48.150]  I wonder if more people know that version or the original version.
[53:48.810 --> 53:51.010]  I don't think the original one was even a single.
[53:51.170 --> 53:51.790]  So I...
[53:51.790 --> 53:51.830]  Yeah.
[53:51.950 --> 53:53.710]  Like, it has to be.
[53:53.970 --> 53:58.890]  How do you go from like, okay, we need to put... we need to license music for our sports game.
[53:59.130 --> 54:01.010]  We want some kind of hip, fresh stuff.
[54:01.610 --> 54:02.730]  Nothing too expensive.
[54:02.750 --> 54:04.830]  So we have to get some up and coming artists.
[54:05.950 --> 54:08.450]  Here's a song about big asses.
[54:09.350 --> 54:10.630]  What if we cut all that?
[54:10.750 --> 54:12.910]  Does it sound like... if you just like remove the word ass.
[54:13.050 --> 54:13.770]  Do you think hockey?
[54:14.090 --> 54:15.570]  And somebody's like, I think I could see a puck.
[54:15.750 --> 54:18.590]  And they're like, okay, let's just cut all the references to ass out.
[54:18.650 --> 54:20.050]  And then people just think we like hockey.
[54:20.170 --> 54:20.870]  And they're like, perfect.
[54:20.990 --> 54:22.030]  Put it in the... it's cheap.
[54:22.130 --> 54:22.890]  Put it in the game.
[54:23.470 --> 54:28.070]  Do people still do that where they'll record different versions of the song for radio?
[54:28.550 --> 54:29.390]  I think so, yeah.
[54:29.610 --> 54:29.830]  Yeah.
[54:29.830 --> 54:32.130]  I don't think there's a... I don't think that's ever going away.
[54:32.450 --> 54:35.050]  I just feel like they just play it or like mute it now.
[54:35.310 --> 54:37.110]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of like...
[54:37.110 --> 54:40.770]  I do hear a lot of like hip hop songs on the radio that are just muted at the moment.
[54:40.990 --> 54:41.150]  Yeah.
[54:42.230 --> 54:44.870]  I remember listening to... what was it?
[54:44.970 --> 54:45.790]  Purple Pills.
[54:46.490 --> 54:47.210]  D12 song.
[54:48.790 --> 54:53.030]  And it's the... the radio one is just literally a completely different song.
[54:53.950 --> 54:55.290]  Like all the lyrics are different.
[54:56.090 --> 54:56.630]  Oh wow.
[54:56.630 --> 55:00.990]  How about that... that CeeLo Green classic, Forget You?
[55:01.690 --> 55:02.390]  Oh yeah.
[55:05.860 --> 55:08.900]  Anyway, sorry, we can talk about RSS and all that stuff.
[55:08.980 --> 55:09.940]  I just... I wanted to...
[55:09.940 --> 55:10.140]  Oh!
[55:10.280 --> 55:11.080]  We're talking about music.
[55:11.380 --> 55:13.460]  We should talk about RSS and all that stuff.
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.280]  But first, what if I pitched to you guys on an idea?
[55:17.820 --> 55:22.600]  On another way to make money in tandem to the regulation podcast or
[55:23.180 --> 55:26.980]  in case things go south on the podcast and we need to pivot.
[55:27.680 --> 55:29.860]  The other day... it's been about... it's been a while now.
[55:29.940 --> 55:32.860]  I think I actually talked about this before I formalized the idea.
[55:33.060 --> 55:35.140]  I think I might even mention it on or near Anma.
[55:35.640 --> 55:40.680]  About a month or so ago, I was driving around and I was just in a neighborhood stuck at a stoplight.
[55:40.920 --> 55:43.180]  And I was immediately behind a dump truck.
[55:43.840 --> 55:45.940]  And I don't really pay much attention to dump trucks.
[55:45.960 --> 55:49.020]  But that day I decided that that dump truck was interesting.
[55:49.160 --> 55:50.420]  It just like stuck out to me.
[55:50.680 --> 55:55.040]  And so I was looking at it and I realized a dump truck's not that big.
[55:55.440 --> 55:57.960]  Like it was... it fit on the road with me.
[55:58.140 --> 56:02.220]  And I was like, man, you could probably have a dump truck as your personal vehicle.
[56:02.560 --> 56:05.260]  And then I was thinking about like the benefits of a dump truck.
[56:05.560 --> 56:08.560]  You look at the back, you could fit a lot of shit in that thing.
[56:08.620 --> 56:09.700]  Like I was thinking recently...
[56:09.700 --> 56:11.780]  I've been doing some furniture moving and stuff recently.
[56:11.960 --> 56:13.540]  And it's like you get a moving truck.
[56:13.660 --> 56:14.460]  It's huge.
[56:14.640 --> 56:15.600]  It's a pain in the ass.
[56:15.880 --> 56:19.840]  A dump truck... you could throw most of a house in a dump truck very unceremoniously.
[56:19.980 --> 56:21.520]  And it'd be like no big deal, right?
[56:21.700 --> 56:22.380]  It's like a big pickup.
[56:22.380 --> 56:25.740]  And that got me thinking, what if you bought a dump truck
[56:26.120 --> 56:29.680]  and you turned it into a side business where you just like tape a sign
[56:30.080 --> 56:32.380]  on the side of it that says like, need a dump?
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.280]  And then you just like drive around to Walmart's and Home Depot's,
[56:36.660 --> 56:39.880]  just up and down the aisles and then wait for your phone to ring.
[56:39.960 --> 56:42.900]  And I guarantee you in a day, you just drive to a dude's house.
[56:42.980 --> 56:45.140]  He's like, yeah, I just got all this lawn furniture I want to get rid of.
[56:45.280 --> 56:46.340]  And you don't even have to help him, right?
[56:46.340 --> 56:49.760]  You could be like, anything you want, throw it in my dump truck.
[56:50.400 --> 56:51.120]  200 bucks.
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.360]  I'll get rid of it.
[56:52.360 --> 56:55.860]  And then you just drive around for eight hours until your dump truck's full.
[56:56.040 --> 56:59.520]  And then you go to the dump and you pay like 400 bucks to throw it out or whatever.
[56:59.740 --> 57:01.360]  Probably clear like a grand or more.
[57:01.560 --> 57:04.080]  And if we got two dump trucks, Gavin, think about this.
[57:04.300 --> 57:07.260]  We could have a two person or we could even get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[57:07.400 --> 57:09.880]  But I was thinking we could call it dump and dumper.
[57:12.200 --> 57:14.340]  We could have a dump truck and a dumper truck.
[57:14.460 --> 57:17.840]  And then we could just go around and provide the service.
[57:17.840 --> 57:19.420]  And we're not really even doing any work.
[57:19.420 --> 57:21.180]  We're just driving from point A to point B,
[57:21.180 --> 57:23.540]  letting people throw their own shit in the dump truck.
[57:23.740 --> 57:24.500]  So we don't even get out.
[57:25.180 --> 57:26.340]  Yeah, we don't really have to get out.
[57:26.400 --> 57:32.780]  We'll have to deal with it at the, I guess, the city landfill or wherever we get rid of it.
[57:33.140 --> 57:34.700]  There'll probably be some effort there.
[57:35.040 --> 57:35.920]  But that's pretty much it.
[57:36.120 --> 57:40.260]  And then also, as we age and become successful, we could change the name to Dumpy Old Men.
[57:42.200 --> 57:45.080]  So it seems to be mostly based around the name.
[57:45.980 --> 57:47.000]  Yeah, I got a lot of names.
[57:47.220 --> 57:48.120]  Dump Up The Volume.
[57:48.640 --> 57:49.880]  I got Big Dumps.
[57:49.960 --> 57:50.920]  I got Dump Star.
[57:50.920 --> 57:54.020]  I got Pump and Dump, if you want to focus on gyms.
[57:55.340 --> 57:57.180]  I got, oh, there's a good one.
[57:58.020 --> 57:58.380]  Dumpty.
[57:58.960 --> 57:59.820]  The Boys of Dumpty.
[57:59.960 --> 58:01.440]  You know, we have, yeah, Boys of Dumpty.
[58:01.500 --> 58:04.280]  We have a whole Humpty Dumpty thing in our past.
[58:04.660 --> 58:07.120]  So I wanted to call it Dumpasaurus, but that exists.
[58:07.240 --> 58:09.560]  There's already a service that does exactly that called Dumpasaurus.
[58:10.260 --> 58:12.640]  What if, well, Dumpty could be if you just deliver golf tees.
[58:13.200 --> 58:13.820]  That's true.
[58:14.220 --> 58:14.740]  That's true.
[58:14.880 --> 58:17.900]  Or we could do bathtubs and we could be Tub Dumpers.
[58:21.780 --> 58:22.580]  So stupid.
[58:24.080 --> 58:25.240]  I guarantee you.
[58:25.400 --> 58:28.460]  Here, I've even done a little bit of work on it.
[58:28.520 --> 58:29.120]  Here, hold on a second.
[58:29.220 --> 58:29.980]  Let me copy this.
[58:31.060 --> 58:32.740]  Are you allowed to just start your own landfill?
[58:34.220 --> 58:36.000]  Dude, if you had the land, I would think so.
[58:36.100 --> 58:38.120]  Here is an option.
[58:38.680 --> 58:43.380]  That is a Volvo VNL 64 T300 for sale.
[58:43.540 --> 58:44.540]  24 grand.
[58:45.080 --> 58:45.880]  It's gorgeous.
[58:46.340 --> 58:47.560]  It's in Central Texas.
[58:47.640 --> 58:50.740]  We could pick it up tomorrow and bam, we could get started immediately.
[58:50.740 --> 58:51.760]  I'm not saying we should.
[58:51.980 --> 58:55.840]  I'm just saying it's nice to know that that's available out there for us.
[58:55.840 --> 58:56.260]  24 grand.
[58:56.580 --> 58:57.560]  If and when we want.
[58:57.580 --> 58:59.300]  And it's a 2008, man.
[58:59.460 --> 59:00.300]  That's, you know, it's good.
[59:00.920 --> 59:01.160]  Yeah.
[59:01.820 --> 59:05.740]  It's already got 1,331,000 miles on it and it's going strong.
[59:05.840 --> 59:07.740]  These things are built to last.
[59:07.760 --> 59:08.660]  Wait, it has what?
[59:09.180 --> 59:12.320]  Wait, it has 1,333,000 miles?
[59:12.320 --> 59:13.300]  That's what it says.
[59:13.920 --> 59:15.040]  Oh my God.
[59:15.320 --> 59:17.780]  It's not just for popping out to the shops.
[59:17.920 --> 59:19.280]  It's been driven all the time.
[59:19.720 --> 59:21.940]  A million is crazy.
[59:22.840 --> 59:25.000]  That's to the moon and back twice.
[59:28.560 --> 59:29.940]  I guess it's done 1.3.
[59:30.120 --> 59:31.960]  And we're not going nearly that far.
[59:32.060 --> 59:34.480]  We're just going through some rich neighborhoods to the dump.
[59:35.180 --> 59:37.860]  I will say, I like where your head is at.
[59:38.060 --> 59:41.360]  I am wondering if maybe you just need to place some more trucks.
[59:41.920 --> 59:46.040]  Maybe you're just missing trucks and you're trying to find a way to bring them back into your life.
[59:46.580 --> 59:47.420]  I think you're right.
[59:47.420 --> 59:48.520]  There might be some truth to that.
[59:48.520 --> 59:53.600]  But dude, come on, rolling around in a dump truck called dump and dumper or dumpy old men
[59:53.600 --> 59:55.180]  would be pretty fucking cool.
[59:55.380 --> 01:00:00.860]  And as silly as it is, I guarantee you that business model immediately works.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.880]  And I bet within a month and a half, you've paid that off and you're just making pure profit.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.960]  I think you're underestimating how much it costs to dump a whole dump truck's worth.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.060]  Well, I looked into it.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.720]  I looked into it and I couldn't find...
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:14.700]  I do my research.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.700]  I couldn't find any landfills that listed prices for dump trucks,
[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.580]  but for the biggest truck they had listed, it was like 250 bucks.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.640]  But I think you could probably fit a good $10,000 worth of stuff in one dump truck
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:29.300]  by the end of the day.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.000]  So if you have to pay even a grand as a dumping fee,
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.900]  you're still taking home, you know, nine grand a day or something.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.380]  I wouldn't trust that dump truck on my patio.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.900]  I don't think it could support that.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.140]  That's fair.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:40.900]  Looking at the truck.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:41.880]  I think it's too big.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.240]  What if it was if you treated it kind of like an ice cream van
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.080]  where you had like a special dump song that played
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.540]  and as you drove around the neighborhoods,
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.600]  people would hear the dump song and come running outside of the chairs and stuff.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.600]  I really like that as well.
[01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.420]  Would it be thong song and it's just the dumps like a truck part over and over again?
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.580]  It would just be...
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.680]  It would just be Dumb and Dumber singing Mockingbird.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.720]  Over and over and over again.
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:08.380]  Yeah.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.480]  Locked in a dump truck song.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.840]  We don't even have a theme song for this podcast yet, but we have a dump truck song.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.120]  Why don't we have a theme song?
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.620]  We have to probably pick one or something.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.640]  I don't know.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:24.740]  We'll just get the old one.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.240]  Make one.
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:26.900]  I don't know.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:27.280]  Buy it.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.220]  Can we just buy it or something?
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.400]  Well, if we had the rights to it for the other podcast, we still got the rights to it.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.040]  That is a good point.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.380]  We now have the rights.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:38.160]  We don't have the rights to that song.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.620]  Yeah, that is not how that works.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.100]  We definitely no longer have the rights.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:43.660]  It is also very expensive.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.200]  So if you want to make a theme song, let us know, I guess.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.320]  I made one for So Alright the other day.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:51.040]  It was pretty good.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:51.880]  Really?
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.100]  What did you use?
[01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:53.540]  Hell yeah.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.240]  Dude, I fucking used my mouth to do it.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:56.960]  Oh.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.620]  I'm like a Bobby McFerrin.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:02.120]  Nick started it.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:02.660]  Can we get a preview?
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:03.800]  No, fuck you.
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:04.600]  All right.
[01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:05.600]  Oh, come on.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.720]  You can't do it right now?
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.520]  Just a little bit?
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.420]  I don't remember it.
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:08.880]  I don't have it.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.060]  This is already a long episode.
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:11.680]  We're supposed to talk about our RSS stuff.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.920]  Oh, we should get into that.
[01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:13.720]  Let's talk about it.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.200]  No, we should have done it 15 minutes ago.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.060]  No, we're doing it right now.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:16.960]  I'm sorry.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.420]  I just wanted to revolutionize the dump industry real fast.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.080]  Okay.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.160]  We can cut all that out and just go to the RSS stuff.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.040]  If we do dump and dumper, I want to drive dumper.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.460]  Can I be honest with you?
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.360]  I thought you would.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:30.500]  Thanks.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.140]  Yeah.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.040]  No, I was already ready to concede dumper to you.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.460]  Do I need a special license?
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.540]  We might.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.720]  We absolutely might.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:39.660]  We'll have to look into that.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.080]  You're going to need any license.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.560]  What if I only have that license, though?
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.780]  I can't drive anything below 16 tons.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.260]  I got a level four commercial license.
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.140]  Do you want to drive my Volvo?
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:55.980]  Oh, I wish I could.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.340]  Oh, Christ.
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.240]  All right, let's get into it all.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:03.880]  I'm excited.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:04.820]  Me too.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.580]  I don't know anything about RSS feeds.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:08.740]  Eric.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:10.800]  Uh, no, you guys got it.
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:11.280]  Go ahead, Gavin.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.440]  Go, Gavin.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:15.620]  Oh, Eric, you wanted us to talk about this for the last 45 minutes.
[01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.200]  No, no, no.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.600]  I'm not the one who brought it up the first time or the second time.
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.340]  I tried to steer it to here.
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:21.900]  That's it.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:22.940]  Okay, who brought it up?
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.460]  Take it away, Jeff.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.240]  Hey, what's up?
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.640]  It's your boy, Lil Jeffy here.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.900]  We're an hour into the podcast and you're doing introductions.
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.320]  And I just want to talk about, you know, I don't know if you're aware,
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:41.900]  but Rooster Teeth, the company we all used to work for, very recently, very quietly,
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:44.720]  wasn't well brought... a lot of people didn't hear about it.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.740]  It certainly wasn't well explained or documented publicly.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.200]  But that company, Rooster Teeth, very quietly closed down in the middle of the night.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:54.940]  Nobody saw it coming.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.480]  Nobody knew.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.380]  We were all caught off guard by it.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.080]  We certainly didn't have months and months and months of excruciating time to prepare for it.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.100]  And so as a result of that, our little podcast, the F*** Face podcast,
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.680]  we lost the rights to because it was owned by Rooster Teeth Productions,
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.560]  because we created it while in the employ of Rooster Teeth Productions.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.040]  And so when Rooster Teeth was shut down by Warner Brothers,
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.880]  all of the intellectual property that the employees made as employees,
[01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.320]  or that was owned by the company, became the rights of Warner Brothers,
[01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:35.040]  who was willing to work with all the individual content creators to...
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.560]  or Rooster Teeth employees that were interested in the IP that they had worked on or created
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:45.880]  to try to help them acquire those rights, I guess, would be the way to say it.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.580]  And that turns out a very long and painful process.
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.400]  And it's not anybody's fault.
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.600]  I don't think any of us were mad at anyone.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:58.540]  It wasn't like us versus Warner Brothers or Rooster Teeth or anything like that.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.900]  There's a lawyer for every lawyer, and everything needs to be
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.120]  checked and cross-checked and spelled out explicitly in contracts and stuff.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.220]  And some stuff was real easy to get.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:13.320]  I got so all right in about 13 minutes.
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.840]  But F*** Face was a really valuable property for Rooster Teeth.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:25.340]  And it, because of that, was more complicated to acquire the rights to.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.240]  And so we did, but it just took a long time.
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:35.040]  It was a double whammy too, because not only was it profitable enough that it was worth something,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.780]  it also wasn't like a big heavy hitter like Ruby or Red vs. Blue.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.000]  It's just some dogshit little podcast in the corner.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.140]  So it didn't necessarily have the priority of the heavy hitter,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.560]  even though it did require an actual purchase.
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.560]  Right. We're not Death Battle or Ruby or Red vs. Blue.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.940]  We're not that high up on the food chain,
[01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.360]  but we're high enough on the food chain to be on the food chain.
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:59.820]  And so it just, there was a lot of, you know, it was just a lot of back and forth.
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:04.400]  And, you know, trying to acquire what we could and as much as we could.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.420]  And, you know, we're very happy to report that we own the entire back catalog of F*** Face.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.220]  We own the name F*** Face.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:15.840]  We own all of the merchandising designs for F*** Face.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.080]  All of the supplemental F*** Face content.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.700]  We own F*** Face Off, which was the first exclusive show.
[01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:27.360]  The only stuff we didn't maintain the rights to was the Let's Play content.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.600]  And the song, I guess.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:31.120]  And the song. The Let's Play content and the song.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:35.220]  And we've wanted to talk about it and explain it along the way.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.400]  And we've been very close.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.900]  But it has literally been, for the last, I would say, three weeks,
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.260]  a it's all going to be worked out tomorrow.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.140]  So just wait till tomorrow.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.360]  And it's like tomorrow rolls around.
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.020]  And we're like, you know, there was one other person had to take a look at something
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:50.360]  or this got kicked back for this one little thing.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.200]  So it'll probably be tomorrow.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.500]  And it's just been tomorrows for a couple of weeks.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.700]  But we're finally through all that.
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:00.720]  And it was a lot of work on Gavin's end.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.280]  I really appreciate all the work you did, Gavin.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.080]  You definitely took the lead on that in a lot of ways.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.600]  And it means a lot.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:09.860]  Absolutely.
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:10.760]  Yeah.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.120]  Yeah.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.060]  Huge for us.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.620]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:17.560]  It was fun to finally, like, step up in the final days of the company
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.780]  and use my email for, like, real business.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.700]  And then in the middle of all that, my email got turned off.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.200]  But one of the advantages of us having the IP now is we have our old feed, right?
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.880]  So people can now listen if they were subscribed to F*** Face,
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.600]  they will now get the regulation pod in that place,
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.280]  as well as we offer a ad-free version on our Patreon.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.120]  At $10, the extra medium tier.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.540]  The rollout wasn't ideal.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.980]  You know, we were kind of dealing with...
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.280]  we were trying to shoot at moving targets all along the way.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.100]  And, you know, we made some missteps, of course.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:04.840]  But the most important thing for us was to be there and to be available and not skip a beat.
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.040]  You know, we said that in as many ways as we could over and over again,
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.560]  that we, for the audience, we want it to be...
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.400]  and clearly it wasn't transparent at all,
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.060]  but we wanted it to be as transparent as possible.
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.260]  You listen to us on one Wednesday, Rooster Teeth goes out of business,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:21.180]  regulation spins up, you listen to us the next Wednesday in the same place at the same time,
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.560]  like nothing ever happened.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.820]  We wanted to make it as easy and seamless as possible on y'all as we could.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.060]  And we did assume that it would be a shitshow.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:29.880]  We did.
[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:31.500]  We just still wanted to do it anyway.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.980]  And I think even though it wasn't seamless, we still didn't have a gap.
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.840]  And I'm super happy about that.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.020]  Super happy about it.
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:41.260]  Yeah, it didn't go perfectly, but we didn't expect it to.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.720]  And we just, more than anything, we just wanted to be there and making content.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.080]  And this is, I don't know, I hope it comes across,
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:56.480]  but this is, outside of my family, the flesh and blood of my family,
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.220]  this is the most important thing in my life.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.740]  And I get... it means everything to me.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.100]  And the idea of stopping, it would crush my soul.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.880]  And so I didn't want to stop.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:11.780]  I didn't want to stop.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.120]  I didn't want to pause.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.180]  I didn't want to stop for a week, let alone a day.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:23.160]  And I would rather deal with the foibles and the little fires that pop up along the way
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.160]  than stop and wait and wait and wait.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.880]  Because if we did that, we'd probably be recording episode one today.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.320]  Oh, God.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.440]  Yeah, that's probably true.
[01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:32.860]  I didn't even think about that.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:33.480]  That's terrible.
[01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:34.360]  Yeah, no.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:40.780]  Can you imagine spending the last five to six weeks totally sitting on your hands?
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.460]  Not communicating with our audience,
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.200]  not communicating with each other in this way,
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.460]  not creating this thing that we're all in love with and obsessed with.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:48.980]  Yeah, I couldn't.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:49.980]  It just wasn't an option.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.500]  And so thank you so much to the audience,
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:59.040]  to every comment leaver and regulation listener for your patience with us,
[01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.880]  with our temporary feeds and our temporary solutions and following us along the way.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.940]  Now we have our forever homes.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:10.340]  I think the only thing we still would like to do at some point is change the Instagram name,
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:12.640]  but that's not a huge priority today.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:19.080]  And I think we're finally settled and in our groove, right?
[01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:22.200]  I think like as of this episode, we're like, we're good.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:27.820]  This is the first episode we've recorded 100% good and ready to just move forward, kick an ass.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:28.360]  Yeah.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:28.900]  Hell yeah.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:29.880]  Absolutely.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:34.660]  So we have our regular, where you get the podcast and everything channel,
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:36.260]  but we also have a secondary channel,
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.180]  because just because we don't have the rights to our old gameplay,
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.840]  didn't mean that we wanted to stop doing gameplay altogether.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.860]  So we do have the secondary YouTube channel,
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.880]  where all of our gameplay and other things will be going.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.820]  So you can subscribe to both channels and check them both out,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.100]  because we're updating frequently.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.900]  And then there's even more stuff on the Patreon.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:57.940]  So it's very exciting.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.700]  And I'm very excited to continue to do this stuff with you guys.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:02.560]  Hell yeah.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:05.500]  You think Precom is kind of a lazy name?
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:06.820]  Say it again.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:07.620]  What?
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.340]  Is what a lazy name?
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:10.160]  Did you say Precom?
[01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:10.860]  Precom.
[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.160]  He said Precom as like a closer.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.640]  But I'm not done talking.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.120]  What's lazy about it?
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.380]  Just doesn't have a certain name.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.000]  Precom?
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.340]  It's just pre.
[01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.740]  It's adding pre to a thing.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.400]  It'd be like if you ordered orange juice,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.980]  but your empty glass is just called pre juice.
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.800]  Like you could just technically apply it to everything.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.380]  You're like if tortillas were pre burrito.
[01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:42.580]  I think technically it would be like if somebody gave you a glass
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:45.920]  and then walked by and put the tiniest squeeze from an orange in it
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.580]  and said, I'll be back later with the rest.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.860]  It's what I put down the first slice for a sandwich,
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:53.840]  just a piece of bread.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.060]  And it's pre sandwich.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.200]  It's pre sandwich.
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.020]  Oh man, I got pre sandwich everywhere.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.200]  Oh, the pre sandwich went moldy.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.360]  I just had to throw away so many pre sandwiches.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.500]  Oh my God.
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.840]  I will say we should put a bow on our thing.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:14.760]  This is one last thing.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.740]  I have an exciting announcement to make.
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.140]  We're excited about.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.740]  No, don't say all Christ.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.300]  It's a genuine.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:21.500]  I just don't know what it is.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.740]  I know we don't know what it is.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.880]  I don't know what it is.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.480]  We talked about a little bit the cookbook.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.780]  We have a cookbook that we released a long time ago.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.500]  And people have been wondering about a PDF version.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.780]  They've been very patient with us.
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.280]  And we've been saying, hey, we're working it out.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.240]  A lot of that working it out was what we just talked about of like.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.380]  All of it was that 100% of it.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.740]  There's not a little bit of it.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.860]  There's also now now that we have it settled,
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.840]  that is going to become available to all of our patrons for free,
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.740]  no matter what tier you're at, $5, $10, whatever.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:55.460]  Any of your tiers, you will get that for free.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.620]  And we're also going to put it up in our shop for $6.99.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:02.540]  So if you just want to buy it and you don't want to be a patron, totally fine.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:06.380]  It will be available as in a PDF form on our Patreon page,
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:10.400]  which I assume we have linked in the description of this podcast.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.700]  Yes, I'm making a note right now to even say cookbook is out in PDF form
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.020]  at patreon.com slash the regulation pod.
[01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.820]  So enjoy that. I love our cookbook so much.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.400]  I'm so happy that we were able to make that.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.540]  Jeff, you did such a great job with the photos.
[01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:25.020]  The art in it is fantastic.
[01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:29.060]  I'm so glad that people that were not able to get the physical version
[01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.760]  will now have access to.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.880]  A lot of wise written words in that book, too.
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.310]  A lot to pay attention to.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.800]  I'm also very excited about it.
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.660]  That book was definitely a labor of love for Tony,
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:47.600]  who did the vast majority of the work on it, I think.
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:53.420]  It was something that we're very proud of and excited to share it with more people.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.700]  Is the regulation podcast just longer than the other one?
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.060]  I don't think so.
[01:13:59.260 --> 01:13:59.820]  Not at all.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:01.060]  We just had to catch up.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:01.980]  It's not.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.400]  Oh, speaking of which, we should probably wrap it up.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.760]  We just had that whole serious RSS discussion and kind of the explanation to sum up
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.240]  why we've talked around things for the last month and not been able to just,
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.340]  I don't know, be 100% open as we go through it.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.460]  We just couldn't potentially damage any negotiations or deals.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.340]  In all sincerity, I do want to say a special thank you
[01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:35.600]  to Jordan and Hannah and Yuri and Hirsch and everybody at Rooster Teeth,
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.580]  who, after they got laid off just like us, stuck around to help negotiate
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.440]  these licensing deals and help us acquire our intellectual property.
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:48.500]  That was a lot of work for them, and they definitely didn't have to
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:52.140]  have to care so much as they were also losing their jobs.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:57.180]  So I really do appreciate everybody that helped us get our independence.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:58.140]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:01.860]  The ability to just text Hannah instead of have to deal directly
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.220]  with someone I've never spoken to at Warner.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.540]  Absolutely game changing.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:07.280]  Yeah.
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.460]  Throughout that whole process.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.520]  And they were just they were they were so helpful and kind and
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:15.400]  and seemed to genuinely want to help us get to get our rights.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.160]  And I just I really, really, really appreciate it.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.800]  It would have been so much harder without them.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.160]  If at all possible, you know.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:22.500]  What a great episode.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.540]  It was nice to sync back up.
[01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.560]  I'm excited for next week.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.780]  Don't even have to wait a full week.
[01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:30.840]  Are we allowed to call our own episode a great episode?
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.800]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:33.620]  Absolutely.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:38.400]  Oh, I didn't even get to ask Andrew if he learned his chair.
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.260]  Oh, you have to wait till next week.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:42.580]  That's a little tease.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.260]  Little tease.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:46.860]  That's a no tease.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.540]  I love it.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:49.960]  That's definitely that's definitely a no.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.700]  That's a that's a that's a oh, shit.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.360]  I have a week to learn my chair now.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:57.880]  Christ, no big old tease.
[01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.420]  I want to tease that I got a new chair also.
[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:02.680]  So there's new chair discussion in the next episode.
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.200]  A lot of chair content next episode.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.200]  We'll let you know who learned their chair first.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.240]  I'm really, really excited.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:11.660]  Oh, while we're teasing stuff about chairs, I'd like to tease out.
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:12.920]  Here's a tease.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.460]  Did Jeff get a new chair?
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:16.420]  Tune in next week to find out.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.560]  Maybe he did.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.880]  Probably he didn't.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.040]  You don't know.
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:21.500]  Thanks for listening.
[01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.080]  Bye.
