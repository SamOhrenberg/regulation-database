[00:40.230 --> 00:43.170]  The final episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[00:43.430 --> 00:47.270]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Andrew Pantin, Gavin Frey,
[00:48.730 --> 00:50.530]  Gracie, Nick, and Eric as well.
[00:50.730 --> 00:52.830]  This is episode 206.
[00:52.970 --> 00:55.710]  This will go down in history as our 205th episode.
[00:57.130 --> 00:58.030]  How's everybody doing?
[00:58.870 --> 01:01.090]  I, you know what? I'm glad that you brought that up.
[01:01.150 --> 01:02.250]  Sorry, Gavin, go ahead.
[01:02.410 --> 01:04.350]  You say your thing, because I think you're going to say good.
[01:05.710 --> 01:07.830]  I said pretty, and then now I'm going to say good.
[01:08.290 --> 01:09.070]  Thanks for asking.
[01:09.650 --> 01:10.250]  You're welcome.
[01:10.930 --> 01:12.190]  I'm glad you're pretty good, man.
[01:12.350 --> 01:13.430]  Well, you didn't know that about you.
[01:14.390 --> 01:15.790]  Well, I... Jeff Fox.
[01:16.990 --> 01:19.350]  I was just trying to get credit for a thing I didn't do.
[01:19.450 --> 01:20.790]  I don't know why you had to call me out like that.
[01:20.990 --> 01:22.130]  It was very rude of you.
[01:24.050 --> 01:26.530]  I got some stuff, I guess, to unpack.
[01:27.590 --> 01:28.410]  This is the end.
[01:28.690 --> 01:30.930]  I gave some some of it last episode.
[01:31.850 --> 01:35.570]  I've had this has been, I mean, obviously a difficult time for all of us
[01:35.570 --> 01:36.730]  for a variety of reasons.
[01:37.330 --> 01:41.890]  I maybe have uniquely suffered in a way that I have not shared with anyone here.
[01:42.290 --> 01:46.250]  Do you guys remember Episode 196?
[01:46.730 --> 01:47.950]  Remember that a long time ago?
[01:48.170 --> 01:49.310]  We're going to do that whole thing.
[01:49.470 --> 01:53.510]  Yeah. And do you remember how I got a Herman Miller chair
[01:53.990 --> 01:57.710]  as part of, you know, you know, things for it?
[01:58.730 --> 02:02.250]  I planned on sitting in my Herman Miller for the first time
[02:02.250 --> 02:07.030]  during 196 because we had this whole thing planned.
[02:07.370 --> 02:11.970]  And while you were all uncomfortable, I would be very comfortable.
[02:12.610 --> 02:18.210]  But then 196 got canceled and then the company died.
[02:18.310 --> 02:24.130]  So I am still using my shitty chair and have yet to touch my Herman Miller.
[02:24.370 --> 02:28.490]  That's which I have, which I've had on you for months now.
[02:28.490 --> 02:29.930]  That's if it's still in the box.
[02:30.110 --> 02:31.550]  Ridiculous. No, I.
[02:31.550 --> 02:35.770]  It's just loose in the other room and I haven't been using it.
[02:36.110 --> 02:38.970]  And it is. Oh, my back.
[02:39.170 --> 02:40.550]  I hate this stuff.
[02:40.710 --> 02:42.110]  This shit stool.
[02:42.430 --> 02:43.930]  Can you change it right now?
[02:44.050 --> 02:46.910]  Can you go over? No, because it doesn't make sense because we're.
[02:47.030 --> 02:48.990]  No, he's he's the last one.
[02:49.250 --> 02:50.150]  He's right. Yeah.
[02:50.190 --> 02:51.790]  So be comfortable for the end.
[02:52.150 --> 02:54.410]  No, I'll be comfortable on the new thing.
[02:54.930 --> 02:57.510]  Yeah. I'm going to start Herman Miller on the new one.
[02:57.990 --> 02:59.430]  I yeah, I think so. I think I might.
[02:59.430 --> 03:04.510]  Should we try to release episode one ninety six in the new thing then?
[03:05.290 --> 03:06.410]  Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
[03:06.570 --> 03:07.850]  OK. All right.
[03:08.110 --> 03:12.470]  So let's get let's prioritize that so that Andrew can sit in his chair sooner than later.
[03:12.970 --> 03:14.230]  Then it will have the opposite problem.
[03:14.290 --> 03:17.690]  What I'd be like, welcome to episode twelve, the eleventh podcast of our
[03:19.470 --> 03:21.590]  welcome to help us at twelve, our thirteenth podcast.
[03:21.690 --> 03:22.830]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:22.830 --> 03:23.190]  That's fine.
[03:23.710 --> 03:24.810]  I think it's very us.
[03:25.230 --> 03:26.570]  Feels a hundred percent us.
[03:26.570 --> 03:29.970]  Or we just slot it in after episode one hundred ninety five.
[03:31.130 --> 03:33.130]  That's also great.
[03:33.330 --> 03:33.830]  That's also great.
[03:34.330 --> 03:38.630]  I oh, that and that that actually that that should be reassuring to the audience
[03:38.630 --> 03:41.630]  because that's us telling the audience, listen, we plan on this one
[03:41.630 --> 03:43.490]  going at least one hundred ninety five episodes.
[03:44.390 --> 03:45.110]  That would be the goal.
[03:45.970 --> 03:49.370]  Yeah. Should we start a new podcast every two hundred and six,
[03:49.490 --> 03:50.790]  a.k.a. two hundred five episodes?
[03:51.210 --> 03:53.510]  No, I fucking quit.
[03:57.730 --> 04:01.330]  I feel it's also I gave a little bit of a clue last episode.
[04:01.450 --> 04:04.590]  I'm ready to reveal my long awaited Easter egg.
[04:05.290 --> 04:05.930]  Eight months.
[04:06.550 --> 04:09.330]  Jeff, you made fun saying fun of me saying it was nine months ago.
[04:09.730 --> 04:11.010]  I added some months to that.
[04:11.130 --> 04:12.910]  I wanted to. Oh, clever boy.
[04:13.130 --> 04:13.590]  Clever.
[04:14.290 --> 04:15.890]  This is eight months old.
[04:16.330 --> 04:17.530]  It has been discovered.
[04:18.270 --> 04:21.370]  How many how many places have eight times
[04:21.890 --> 04:24.530]  by people that I guess just didn't know what it is.
[04:25.170 --> 04:28.450]  The day we recorded our potato facts episode,
[04:29.030 --> 04:32.010]  there is a I think we're making fun of you, Jeff, for having a million other
[04:32.010 --> 04:33.410]  podcasts. Yeah.
[04:33.750 --> 04:35.250]  There's something about that.
[04:35.650 --> 04:38.890]  And I think Eric said, what's the name of your podcast to me?
[04:39.410 --> 04:44.110]  And I said that it would be called the first permanent potato patches
[04:44.110 --> 04:46.910]  on U.S. soil were established in 1719 here in Leningrad, New Hampshire.
[04:47.330 --> 04:48.330]  I read the fact again.
[04:49.390 --> 04:50.790]  People assume that was a joke.
[04:51.230 --> 04:54.330]  I later that day made a podcast episode.
[04:54.530 --> 04:57.790]  Called that and uploaded it to.
[04:58.010 --> 04:58.750]  Oh, that's the wrong.
[04:59.230 --> 05:00.150]  I'm on the wrong computer.
[05:00.410 --> 05:04.890]  Yeah, that was, hey, going out the way I started with the wrong links.
[05:05.170 --> 05:07.650]  I got I'm using two computers I made.
[05:07.910 --> 05:12.210]  So that fact was taken from a giant list of facts about potatoes.
[05:12.650 --> 05:17.230]  And I recorded myself reading that list and giving just general potato musings.
[05:17.470 --> 05:20.490]  It's been around for eight months waiting to be found.
[05:21.090 --> 05:24.630]  So you get a little bonus potato podcast on your way out
[05:25.230 --> 05:28.550]  for the people to enjoy 15 minutes long.
[05:28.710 --> 05:32.350]  I thought about making several, but I just thought it's one's enough.
[05:32.630 --> 05:36.050]  And I waited, hoping that someone would look into it
[05:36.050 --> 05:39.450]  because I do say my podcast is and then gave the name.
[05:39.910 --> 05:41.970]  But it was never discovered.
[05:42.690 --> 05:44.670]  The first potato patch on U.S.
[05:44.710 --> 05:45.470]  So this is the description.
[05:45.610 --> 05:48.670]  We're establishing nine foot nil in Derry, New Hampshire by Scottish Irish immigrants.
[05:48.670 --> 05:49.750]  Please subscribe.
[05:56.110 --> 06:00.010]  I don't think I got any subscribers, unfortunately, but
[06:01.210 --> 06:03.910]  I've just been sitting on that for a while waiting.
[06:04.510 --> 06:06.650]  That's fucking brilliant.
[06:07.290 --> 06:08.490]  Absolutely brilliant.
[06:08.490 --> 06:09.330]  Hopefully people like it.
[06:09.470 --> 06:11.350]  Hopefully people enjoy their potato facts.
[06:11.970 --> 06:14.050]  Have you had any interest from advertisers?
[06:14.970 --> 06:17.310]  Oh, no, no, I haven't.
[06:17.310 --> 06:20.790]  It turns out of the eight people that have listened to it,
[06:20.890 --> 06:23.070]  none of them were interested or were advertisers.
[06:23.350 --> 06:25.450]  How did eight people find this?
[06:25.930 --> 06:28.250]  I don't know, but I mean, it's been eight.
[06:28.410 --> 06:29.830]  It's been out for eight months at this point.
[06:29.910 --> 06:32.270]  So one a month, it gets, I guess, the average.
[06:32.690 --> 06:35.070]  Are you sure that's not just you checking on it once a month?
[06:35.410 --> 06:39.690]  No, because I, I, I made that announcement that I still had this
[06:39.690 --> 06:42.930]  like that I had an Easter egg in the wild and I hadn't thought about it
[06:42.930 --> 06:44.450]  for five months at that point.
[06:44.450 --> 06:45.310]  And I had to.
[06:45.810 --> 06:46.630]  So I wasn't checking.
[06:46.890 --> 06:48.290]  I've checked on it probably three times.
[06:50.590 --> 06:52.970]  So that is that I'm trying to think, do I have anything else?
[06:53.050 --> 06:55.610]  I told the Gavin Slack thing that the store.
[06:57.790 --> 06:59.690]  I think that's it. Do you guys have anything?
[07:00.010 --> 07:04.970]  I do. I like I have some like a cleaning house type things.
[07:05.250 --> 07:06.190]  I have two things.
[07:06.230 --> 07:09.890]  One, I've just I was I've been trying to be reflective
[07:10.370 --> 07:12.010]  of the last couple of years.
[07:12.090 --> 07:13.330]  I mean, it's it's weird, right?
[07:13.330 --> 07:14.250]  Because we're continuing.
[07:14.710 --> 07:17.490]  We're going to continue doing like we're just going to get together
[07:17.490 --> 07:19.230]  next Thursday and record the next podcast.
[07:19.350 --> 07:20.750]  It'll just be called something different.
[07:20.890 --> 07:23.790]  So really nothing is going to change other than some branding.
[07:23.950 --> 07:26.710]  But it still is like the end of a thing.
[07:26.810 --> 07:27.830]  And I've wanted to
[07:28.810 --> 07:30.370]  certainly like the end of an era.
[07:30.830 --> 07:35.230]  Maybe like this is the first tome of of because we've already gone
[07:35.230 --> 07:38.630]  through all the chapters and fucking all that nonsense.
[07:38.990 --> 07:42.570]  And I was I was thinking about like moments that stood out to me
[07:42.570 --> 07:46.690]  and just like crazy coincidences or things that just made me feel like.
[07:48.790 --> 07:52.210]  Made me feel like the universe was telling me that we were doing something.
[07:53.250 --> 07:55.590]  That I should continue to invest everything into,
[07:55.690 --> 07:58.430]  like something special or that it mattered or that I should pay attention
[07:58.430 --> 08:02.270]  because what we were doing was was honestly something important,
[08:02.450 --> 08:05.530]  at least to me, and we've talked about this a lot in the past,
[08:06.230 --> 08:09.550]  you know, especially for like the first two years doing this podcast
[08:09.550 --> 08:11.910]  kept me sane. It was my guess.
[08:11.910 --> 08:13.850]  And I think it was for y'all as well.
[08:14.410 --> 08:14.830]  Absolutely.
[08:14.930 --> 08:17.530]  Because we were all navigating a lot of different challenges in our lives,
[08:17.610 --> 08:20.570]  some pandemic related, but also a lot that had nothing to do with it.
[08:21.150 --> 08:24.350]  And so it's been an important
[08:25.690 --> 08:28.430]  foundation in who I am now.
[08:28.550 --> 08:30.650]  And it's it's it is also like.
[08:31.410 --> 08:34.470]  Helped my friendship with Eric and Nick grow
[08:34.470 --> 08:38.110]  and and brought Gracie into all of our lives.
[08:38.110 --> 08:43.130]  And it is only strengthened the triangle that is Gavin, Jeff and Andrew
[08:43.130 --> 08:44.950]  in the most unexpected and wonderful ways.
[08:45.350 --> 08:47.290]  And so I was trying to think back of just like one or two moments
[08:47.290 --> 08:48.310]  that just really stood out to me.
[08:48.550 --> 08:51.970]  And the one that really that really comes to mind,
[08:51.970 --> 08:57.870]  and it's not a crazy moment, but when Emily and I went to surprise y'all
[08:58.450 --> 09:02.190]  and we went to Key West, like in the July 4th weekend,
[09:02.250 --> 09:05.950]  we went and showed up on the camera and everybody noticed us in three seconds.
[09:05.950 --> 09:07.310]  And it was awesome and gratifying.
[09:07.950 --> 09:11.290]  And it was wild because, you know, we were sloppy
[09:11.290 --> 09:12.850]  just being who already existed on that.
[09:13.070 --> 09:15.190]  But when we turned the corner
[09:15.950 --> 09:19.510]  and saw the hot dog man selling hot dogs.
[09:20.310 --> 09:24.770]  And he was also selling merchandise that said, hey, face
[09:25.350 --> 09:28.150]  like he was selling the T-shirts that say, hey, face.
[09:28.210 --> 09:32.230]  And he was selling the the apron that says, hey, face.
[09:32.270 --> 09:33.890]  And it had nothing to do with us.
[09:33.890 --> 09:36.650]  It looked like a North Face logo that was like rebranded.
[09:36.710 --> 09:40.850]  It was like his kitsch that he was doing alongside of alongside of hot dogs.
[09:40.950 --> 09:42.090]  And I was just standing there thinking,
[09:42.590 --> 09:47.050]  out of all the places on the planet Earth for a man to sell hot dogs
[09:47.050 --> 09:52.430]  and hey, face merchandise, it's around the corner from the place
[09:52.430 --> 09:56.350]  that I didn't know existed four months ago that my fiance at the time,
[09:56.430 --> 10:01.990]  wife now, and I decided on a whim to fly across America to go visit in person
[10:01.990 --> 10:06.390]  just to stand under a camera to hopefully entertain
[10:06.910 --> 10:09.110]  some members of our podcast community.
[10:09.630 --> 10:12.810]  And I get to turn the corner and right there is the universe saying, hey, face.
[10:13.710 --> 10:15.650]  This is something I felt.
[10:15.770 --> 10:19.050]  It felt like such a moment in my life where I thought we're
[10:19.050 --> 10:22.570]  we can't ever stop this, what we're doing.
[10:23.010 --> 10:26.710]  This is the universe, like gently telling me constantly in little ways.
[10:26.890 --> 10:28.970]  Hey, you're on the right path. Keep doing it.
[10:28.970 --> 10:31.030]  Which is why we're not going to fucking stop doing face.
[10:31.030 --> 10:32.410]  We're going to call it something else.
[10:32.550 --> 10:35.370]  But what we're doing is never going to stop.
[10:35.790 --> 10:40.370]  And I just wondered if you if if you guys have I've been trying to vamp
[10:40.370 --> 10:43.670]  this a little bit to give you guys time to think if anything like that pops up.
[10:44.330 --> 10:48.190]  I do love that, though, that just being told by the universe
[10:48.190 --> 10:50.470]  that all your energy is going in the right direction.
[10:51.310 --> 10:52.030]  100%. Yeah.
[10:52.270 --> 10:54.370]  And I and I really felt it in that moment.
[10:55.150 --> 10:55.610]  Yeah, I don't know.
[10:55.690 --> 10:58.330]  It's I had a different where obviously I had so much fun.
[10:58.770 --> 11:02.030]  I was so worried about screwing up the show when we started
[11:02.030 --> 11:05.890]  that I it was this weird section.
[11:06.010 --> 11:11.310]  I remember of like probably I don't know when it stopped being stressful to make,
[11:11.510 --> 11:12.150]  but it did happen.
[11:12.270 --> 11:15.610]  It was probably like 140 ish, I would assume.
[11:15.830 --> 11:18.730]  But I just remember when us starting like I'd have so much fun
[11:18.730 --> 11:19.890]  as soon as we were done.
[11:19.950 --> 11:23.830]  But just thinking like, I can't wait for me to do 100 of these.
[11:24.010 --> 11:26.450]  So it isn't it doesn't feel like a thing.
[11:26.450 --> 11:32.150]  And then getting to that point of it's just been the most ridiculous playground
[11:32.770 --> 11:38.250]  in the best way of, as you said, like difficult years.
[11:38.270 --> 11:41.130]  But just knowing that there is this space that
[11:41.910 --> 11:43.770]  we would get to make each other laugh.
[11:44.630 --> 11:46.930]  Invaluable. So appreciated.
[11:48.650 --> 11:52.690]  I don't have, but I never turned a corner and saw a hot dog man
[11:52.690 --> 11:55.230]  and said, hey, face on it.
[11:55.230 --> 12:00.330]  I wish I had something so obnoxiously on the nose,
[12:00.910 --> 12:02.870]  but I don't. I'm trying to.
[12:03.030 --> 12:07.930]  The moment that I had to call Gavin and tell him that I got Wilford Brimley
[12:07.930 --> 12:08.690]  confused
[12:11.670 --> 12:13.170]  with the other dude
[12:13.790 --> 12:17.210]  and that the whole world was going to find out how it was going to hear
[12:17.210 --> 12:21.150]  how dumb I was and being happy, embarrassed, but also happy
[12:21.150 --> 12:25.290]  that everybody on Earth got to, that was going to hear how fucking stupid I am.
[12:26.110 --> 12:30.270]  That was a particularly good moment, too, because I felt safe.
[12:30.650 --> 12:31.690]  I felt like it's OK.
[12:32.350 --> 12:34.410]  They're going to get it.
[12:34.610 --> 12:35.490]  It's going to be fine.
[12:35.670 --> 12:38.290]  And it's going to be it's going to be too entertaining not to cut.
[12:38.570 --> 12:42.570]  I remember having a really nice moment when this was like
[12:42.570 --> 12:46.930]  at the end of 2020 when like a bunch of, I don't know, it was like a shit time.
[12:47.150 --> 12:48.850]  I remember just being bummed out quite a lot.
[12:49.630 --> 12:53.170]  And I think it was during the recording, Andrew, where you were,
[12:53.630 --> 12:57.090]  where you were just talking about how every time you come to us,
[12:57.150 --> 12:58.530]  did you roll an ankle?
[12:59.070 --> 13:00.310]  And I was just pissing.
[13:00.470 --> 13:01.610]  I was pissing myself.
[13:01.870 --> 13:04.630]  And I remember laughing so much and tears were streaming down my face.
[13:04.830 --> 13:09.270]  I just took a picture of my own face because I was like, I have not laughed
[13:09.770 --> 13:12.450]  this hard in years, probably.
[13:12.610 --> 13:14.550]  And I just remember thinking that was a nice moment.
[13:14.670 --> 13:15.930]  So I just snapped my own head.
[13:15.930 --> 13:18.510]  Every time I was miserable,
[13:19.310 --> 13:23.250]  absolutely miserable physically due to being in Austin.
[13:23.670 --> 13:29.390]  When you guys flew me out to do the raid, I got so fucking sick on the second day.
[13:29.770 --> 13:30.410]  I'm coughing.
[13:30.830 --> 13:34.490]  You guys had to get me cough medicine to record the battlefront.
[13:34.530 --> 13:36.370]  Let's play it as a mess.
[13:36.690 --> 13:41.290]  Every time I couldn't make it to Austin without dying in some capacity.
[13:42.650 --> 13:43.890]  Rolling ankles.
[13:45.470 --> 13:49.350]  One year at RTX, literally everybody got the flu and it's just a mess.
[13:49.650 --> 13:51.750]  I couldn't. I would go to RTA.
[13:51.930 --> 13:56.450]  I'd spend like 14 days as my RTX trip because I knew the first seven
[13:56.450 --> 13:58.010]  I would be dead in some way.
[13:58.090 --> 14:01.470]  And so I needed time to be there when I wasn't sick or hurt.
[14:01.990 --> 14:05.890]  Those were your your the story of your journey was always the best
[14:05.890 --> 14:07.170]  fucking thing to listen to, though.
[14:07.210 --> 14:10.410]  It was always so complicated and harder than it needed to be.
[14:10.450 --> 14:12.470]  And it took longer and it was convoluted.
[14:12.470 --> 14:14.250]  And there was like seven missteps.
[14:14.530 --> 14:18.310]  And you ended up at the behest of strangers multiple times.
[14:18.350 --> 14:20.270]  It was always a wild adventure.
[14:20.510 --> 14:24.590]  Well, I guess that picture I just showed was the same week
[14:25.550 --> 14:29.670]  as extra life because I just found a picture of my bruised legs.
[14:30.270 --> 14:32.830]  But it really looks like I have a vagina.
[14:33.010 --> 14:34.450]  I'm not sure I could even post it.
[14:37.690 --> 14:39.070]  I don't know if I should post it.
[14:39.090 --> 14:40.210]  Like the bruised ass?
[14:41.090 --> 14:44.950]  No, I'm like, I'm like, I think I've got nothing on.
[14:45.030 --> 14:46.430]  So I'm cupping my bollocks.
[14:47.050 --> 14:48.590]  Should I just post it and delete it?
[14:48.950 --> 14:49.850]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[14:49.870 --> 14:50.990]  Don't delete it, though. We're good.
[14:51.610 --> 14:53.350]  Screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, screenshot, screenshot.
[14:56.350 --> 14:57.230]  It does!
[14:57.690 --> 15:01.150]  You, I don't, I, like, you described what it is.
[15:01.250 --> 15:02.610]  Oh, that's so funny.
[15:02.850 --> 15:07.590]  Somehow it's still undersold of exactly how it looks.
[15:07.590 --> 15:10.610]  Which is exactly what you described.
[15:12.210 --> 15:13.290]  It's my fingers.
[15:13.510 --> 15:14.550]  It's like I'm cupping.
[15:14.830 --> 15:16.210]  Sure, man. Yeah, whatever you say.
[15:16.490 --> 15:18.470]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, dude, that's your fingers. Sure, dude.
[15:20.370 --> 15:21.970]  Oh, my God.
[15:21.990 --> 15:24.630]  Gavin, thank you for sharing that on the last one.
[15:24.810 --> 15:27.330]  Oh, that is so fucking crazy.
[15:30.730 --> 15:34.050]  I should have said, Gracie, look away before posting it.
[15:34.490 --> 15:35.270]  Oh, my God.
[15:35.330 --> 15:36.450]  Gracie, you've had to see.
[15:36.910 --> 15:38.870]  You've had to see way too much of me.
[15:38.990 --> 15:40.190]  I deeply apologize.
[15:41.030 --> 15:42.150]  Oh, thank you.
[15:42.750 --> 15:44.190]  You know, that actually, thank you, Gavin.
[15:44.270 --> 15:44.910]  That's a great point.
[15:45.270 --> 15:47.750]  When you guys, I don't know if you've come to terms with this.
[15:48.110 --> 15:50.590]  You guys are going to need to wax your assholes again.
[15:50.690 --> 15:51.510]  And it's your fault.
[15:51.670 --> 15:53.030]  Oh, for God's sake.
[15:53.050 --> 15:56.850]  When we were doing that, I pitched that we should make the thing green
[15:56.850 --> 15:59.990]  so we could just put whatever we wanted as the backdrop.
[16:00.370 --> 16:04.390]  But no, you had to have the name of the show on it,
[16:04.430 --> 16:06.090]  which is no longer our show.
[16:06.090 --> 16:08.330]  We can't use those inserts anymore.
[16:08.650 --> 16:10.250]  We're going to need new inserts.
[16:10.850 --> 16:11.510]  Yeah, we'll do it again.
[16:11.910 --> 16:15.370]  As long as my good friends Nick and Eric will join me in the act,
[16:15.650 --> 16:16.870]  I'll do it again. Absolutely.
[16:17.210 --> 16:18.390]  No. What do you mean, no?
[16:19.070 --> 16:20.730]  What do you mean you want us to do?
[16:20.790 --> 16:21.610]  I'm not going to do that.
[16:21.730 --> 16:22.530]  You guys are fucking dumb.
[16:22.930 --> 16:23.710]  We're going to do it twice.
[16:23.990 --> 16:25.930]  All you have to do it is once. Nick's going to do it.
[16:25.990 --> 16:27.210]  Yeah, it's a stand up guy.
[16:27.430 --> 16:29.190]  I'm going to do it zero times.
[16:29.550 --> 16:31.750]  Nick's going to do it once. Nick's in on this.
[16:31.850 --> 16:32.850]  Don't don't listen to Eric.
[16:33.170 --> 16:34.510]  You have to lay down to do it.
[16:34.710 --> 16:35.830]  And I'm a stand up guy.
[16:35.830 --> 16:37.290]  Are you not working on the next thing, Eric?
[16:37.370 --> 16:38.770]  I'm definitely working on the next thing.
[16:38.830 --> 16:40.050]  I'm not doing this for it.
[16:40.470 --> 16:41.930]  Huh? Well, I bet he is.
[16:42.750 --> 16:44.650]  Hey, it's it's it's all a negotiation.
[16:44.850 --> 16:45.470]  We'll figure it out.
[16:45.730 --> 16:46.650]  We got nothing but time.
[16:47.190 --> 16:47.930]  Everyone has a price.
[16:48.330 --> 16:49.470]  That's right. Everybody does.
[16:49.670 --> 16:53.890]  It brought me so much joy realizing that you get we can't use those anymore.
[16:55.250 --> 16:56.310]  We'll have to do it again.
[16:56.750 --> 16:58.730]  I'm just hearing about this and thinking about it
[16:58.730 --> 17:01.210]  for the first time in this moment, and it's it's kind of funny.
[17:02.490 --> 17:04.110]  You know what I've just realized?
[17:04.110 --> 17:08.090]  What? This is the last recording where Eric's my boss.
[17:09.210 --> 17:10.230]  Oh, it's true.
[17:10.330 --> 17:12.710]  Right now, I am Gavin's boss, technically. Yes.
[17:12.830 --> 17:13.890]  All right. Should we do my review?
[17:14.630 --> 17:15.590]  Yeah. You want to do your review?
[17:15.730 --> 17:17.110]  This is what I had planned for it.
[17:17.450 --> 17:21.790]  OK, so I wanted to go out before the company shut down and everything.
[17:22.490 --> 17:26.350]  I wanted to take Gavin out to dinner and then do his formal review
[17:27.170 --> 17:28.830]  and just sort of talk about.
[17:29.050 --> 17:29.930]  So this is how I would go.
[17:30.050 --> 17:33.350]  Gavin, thanks for joining me.
[17:33.350 --> 17:34.910]  This has been great.
[17:35.170 --> 17:37.590]  I really respect our working relationship and everything.
[17:37.810 --> 17:38.810]  How have you been feeling?
[17:39.070 --> 17:41.230]  Let's let's pretend like the company isn't going under or whatever.
[17:41.390 --> 17:43.210]  This is a situation where we're at.
[17:43.450 --> 17:47.370]  How are you feeling with, you know, how things are going, where you're at
[17:47.370 --> 17:49.150]  and where you want to be right now?
[17:49.570 --> 17:52.230]  Phenomenal. I think the podcast has there's no end in sight.
[17:52.510 --> 17:53.830]  I think we could just keep doing this.
[17:54.870 --> 17:56.050]  It's fun every week.
[17:57.170 --> 17:59.430]  And I don't see it going away anytime soon.
[17:59.890 --> 18:01.490]  Oh, that's fantastic. That's so good to hear.
[18:01.490 --> 18:03.310]  I'm really glad because I think your contribution.
[18:03.430 --> 18:05.250]  Oh, thank you so much. That's me getting a steak.
[18:05.350 --> 18:08.350]  We ordered steaks and they just said, oh, what kind of cut did you get?
[18:09.490 --> 18:13.870]  I got the perfect 10, which is just like a big like cowboy style steak.
[18:14.050 --> 18:18.590]  And it's just it's like I got it's like they put butter on it.
[18:18.670 --> 18:20.870]  It's like a compote. I'm I'm fucking stoked.
[18:21.990 --> 18:23.510]  Thank you so much, Gavin.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.890]  I'm so glad. Excuse me. Sorry.
[18:24.890 --> 18:25.670]  Sorry. One sec. One sec.
[18:26.230 --> 18:28.190]  Sorry. I ordered the the peppercorn sauce.
[18:28.990 --> 18:31.750]  Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
[18:31.970 --> 18:32.430]  Good call.
[18:33.470 --> 18:37.150]  That I'm glad you got what you wanted, and that's what I'm hoping to provide you here.
[18:37.270 --> 18:38.450]  Let's forget the sauce here.
[18:38.710 --> 18:39.750]  It's crazy. It's great.
[18:39.830 --> 18:43.470]  But, you know, it's, you know, service, which is you get what you pay for, right?
[18:45.130 --> 18:48.910]  So just sort of looking at where we're at, our reach and what we're doing
[18:49.730 --> 18:52.790]  just over the last year and going into this year.
[18:52.910 --> 18:54.930]  What I want to say is, please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:55.070 --> 18:56.150]  Please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:56.290 --> 18:57.530]  Can you stay? Please stay.
[18:57.530 --> 18:59.350]  Please stay. Please don't go. Please don't go.
[18:59.450 --> 19:00.790]  You're our only hope. Can you please stay?
[19:01.110 --> 19:03.210]  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[19:03.990 --> 19:05.170]  Is that going to work for you?
[19:05.530 --> 19:09.930]  Hey, that's every that's every performance review I ever gave for 21 years.
[19:11.350 --> 19:15.590]  And it did sound like that because I learned I learned from the best.
[19:15.690 --> 19:19.550]  I think, Jeff, over the eight or nine years I worked under you,
[19:19.630 --> 19:21.670]  we only had one performance review.
[19:21.790 --> 19:23.190]  And then afterwards, you were like, I was dumb.
[19:23.350 --> 19:23.790]  Why did we do that?
[19:25.430 --> 19:26.970]  Every day was a performance review.
[19:26.970 --> 19:29.750]  Are you are you my boss as well, Eric, technically?
[19:29.890 --> 19:31.330]  No, no, no.
[19:31.390 --> 19:32.650]  Who's my boss then?
[19:33.090 --> 19:34.110]  Sarah, technically.
[19:34.810 --> 19:36.630]  But I only do that.
[19:36.750 --> 19:38.570]  You're also you're also a contractor.
[19:38.690 --> 19:40.310]  Also, Gracie in the chat just said me.
[19:40.410 --> 19:41.510]  So Gracie is your boss.
[19:42.070 --> 19:43.250]  Gracie is my boss.
[19:43.670 --> 19:45.910]  Gracie, how did you do these last three years?
[19:46.490 --> 19:49.510]  Oh, my God. Oh, you got a happy face.
[19:50.010 --> 19:51.330]  Big happy face. I like that.
[19:51.710 --> 19:52.930]  Yeah, that's how I did.
[19:53.650 --> 19:54.190]  That's great.
[19:54.270 --> 19:56.090]  Because, you know, I've I've been here three years.
[19:56.090 --> 19:57.290]  So. Oh, definitely.
[19:57.590 --> 19:58.850]  Yeah. Mm hmm.
[19:58.850 --> 19:59.790]  Excellent work. Sure.
[20:00.550 --> 20:02.170]  Thanks. Well, I didn't.
[20:02.310 --> 20:03.110]  I wish I knew.
[20:04.730 --> 20:07.450]  I genuinely don't know who I'm supposed to report to.
[20:07.470 --> 20:08.210]  I thought it was you, Eric.
[20:08.630 --> 20:09.430]  Nope. Whatever.
[20:09.610 --> 20:10.950]  What reporting are you doing?
[20:11.470 --> 20:13.110]  I don't I don't know.
[20:13.270 --> 20:15.450]  Whatever reporting he was doing, he wasn't doing it, apparently.
[20:15.610 --> 20:19.310]  I feel like I should report to someone and I never know who to report.
[20:19.470 --> 20:22.830]  I really. Well, I think we all we all get to report to the unemployment line
[20:22.830 --> 20:24.110]  tomorrow. That's true.
[20:26.090 --> 20:27.350]  I think I'm going to still get paid.
[20:27.470 --> 20:31.050]  I feel like my trajectory with Rooster Teeth is Milton from office space
[20:31.050 --> 20:34.290]  and that I'm I have been in the basement the whole time.
[20:34.530 --> 20:37.110]  And I just I'm here, but nobody realizes.
[20:37.370 --> 20:38.250]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[20:38.570 --> 20:40.270]  And then you burn the place down. Yeah.
[20:40.590 --> 20:42.690]  Well, that's I wanted to have a performance review.
[20:42.750 --> 20:43.470]  That's too bad.
[20:44.230 --> 20:45.690]  I guess I could have a Gracie.
[20:46.110 --> 20:48.250]  I'm trying to think if I ever reported anything to Eric.
[20:49.010 --> 20:50.210]  Hmm. I don't think so.
[20:50.310 --> 20:51.650]  Reported. Reported what?
[20:52.330 --> 20:52.910]  That's what I'm saying.
[20:54.170 --> 20:55.670]  Are you my boss, Eric?
[20:56.230 --> 21:01.570]  No, the only people that I was going to be in charge of was you.
[21:01.830 --> 21:04.110]  And they're like, and Gus.
[21:04.290 --> 21:06.310]  And I went, that doesn't make any sense.
[21:06.350 --> 21:07.730]  And they went, OK, yeah, not Gus.
[21:09.190 --> 21:10.150]  In what world?
[21:10.390 --> 21:13.890]  It was just people that it felt like no one else wanted to like
[21:13.890 --> 21:15.970]  have to deal with. Yeah.
[21:16.410 --> 21:17.750]  Well, no timeout for a second.
[21:17.910 --> 21:21.510]  I didn't start doing Let's Play until October is when we did that.
[21:21.770 --> 21:23.350]  Who is my boss before that?
[21:23.830 --> 21:24.670]  Did I have one?
[21:25.170 --> 21:26.710]  No, I mean, it was probably it.
[21:27.030 --> 21:28.210]  Yeah, it was probably Sarah or Stab.
[21:29.130 --> 21:32.650]  Yeah. Also, you keep saying boss like you're you're a contractor.
[21:33.050 --> 21:35.350]  Yeah. We just pay you for.
[21:35.470 --> 21:37.450]  We just pay you for services rendered, bud.
[21:37.610 --> 21:39.110]  I don't know how any of this works.
[21:39.370 --> 21:41.650]  I, I. Hey, clearly.
[21:43.310 --> 21:46.330]  Well, now, now, Andrew, you're a partner.
[21:46.610 --> 21:48.410]  Hell yeah. Whatever that means.
[21:48.750 --> 21:50.570]  Did you get reimbursed for the bog?
[21:51.050 --> 21:53.790]  What bog? The ping pong that you bought?
[21:53.790 --> 21:55.350]  No, I never. No, I never.
[21:55.730 --> 21:57.530]  No, I never assumed I would.
[21:58.190 --> 21:58.750]  Why would I?
[21:59.230 --> 22:00.150]  It's for the company.
[22:00.530 --> 22:01.750]  We got to secure that thing soon.
[22:02.450 --> 22:06.110]  You do. And if we don't, we need to put an air tag in it just to see where it goes.
[22:07.090 --> 22:09.170]  No, I think we still need it for stuff.
[22:09.410 --> 22:10.670]  So I would like to have it.
[22:10.710 --> 22:14.590]  I'm just saying if that's not a reality, we at least need an air tag on it.
[22:15.350 --> 22:19.010]  We just kept saying, I think, three times that we're going to get it
[22:19.010 --> 22:19.990]  and we're going to take it.
[22:20.050 --> 22:22.630]  And you kept going, well, put an air tag in it.
[22:22.630 --> 22:24.550]  I don't know why. We will have it.
[22:24.930 --> 22:25.350]  We will get it.
[22:25.370 --> 22:27.550]  Well, I don't. It's huge. It's big.
[22:27.630 --> 22:29.290]  I don't know where we're going to store it.
[22:29.530 --> 22:31.810]  Jeff didn't have room for me to send him waffle makers.
[22:31.930 --> 22:34.010]  All of a sudden, he's going to have a fucking port-a-potty.
[22:34.150 --> 22:35.750]  We've already secured a location.
[22:35.750 --> 22:37.810]  You understand Jeff's situation.
[22:38.570 --> 22:40.190]  Like, what are you talking about?
[22:41.090 --> 22:42.090]  What are you talking about?
[22:42.610 --> 22:43.630]  Oh, my God.
[22:44.350 --> 22:48.330]  I'm talking about Jeff and his inability to have a port-a-potty.
[22:49.690 --> 22:51.850]  I will. First off, I already had the port-a-potty here.
[22:52.310 --> 22:53.950]  You almost sold it.
[22:54.070 --> 22:55.010]  We've secured it.
[22:55.030 --> 22:58.010]  No, I refused. I almost refused to accept it.
[23:00.190 --> 23:01.990]  We've for two fucking weeks.
[23:02.110 --> 23:02.710]  I dodged that guy.
[23:03.710 --> 23:06.130]  We've we've secured a location for it.
[23:06.130 --> 23:07.670]  We've got a place to keep it safe and sound.
[23:07.710 --> 23:08.450]  OK, we're good.
[23:08.550 --> 23:09.350]  Is it what we talked about?
[23:09.590 --> 23:11.170]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[23:11.610 --> 23:12.890]  Well, why don't I know?
[23:13.010 --> 23:15.090]  Why don't I know that?
[23:15.190 --> 23:19.470]  I feel like if anyone should know, I got to be honest with you.
[23:19.470 --> 23:21.410]  You probably do know.
[23:21.610 --> 23:24.030]  You were probably in the conversation, but you were fucking around.
[23:24.130 --> 23:24.750]  I'm not paying attention.
[23:25.410 --> 23:26.210]  I absolutely know.
[23:26.370 --> 23:27.930]  I listen. I lock in when it's serious.
[23:28.030 --> 23:30.590]  When it's business stuff, port-a-potty stuff.
[23:31.150 --> 23:32.390]  Don't I lock in right now?
[23:32.890 --> 23:34.090]  I'm locked in right now.
[23:34.230 --> 23:39.470]  Yeah, at less of a lock than I would be for a serious work thing.
[23:39.550 --> 23:40.530]  But I'm locked.
[23:40.990 --> 23:44.390]  OK, I'm like a lock that you could kick through.
[23:44.510 --> 23:46.170]  I'm not like the most secure.
[23:46.210 --> 23:49.190]  I'm not a vault when I'm in work mode.
[23:49.190 --> 23:50.550]  Like serious work mode.
[23:50.650 --> 23:51.290]  I'm a vault.
[23:51.770 --> 23:53.050]  This is like a padlock.
[23:53.390 --> 23:54.250]  Hmm. OK.
[23:54.410 --> 23:55.370]  I'm padlocked in.
[23:55.510 --> 23:59.610]  Oh, dear. I've just I've realized that the picture I sent is the least
[23:59.610 --> 24:01.390]  vaginery of three pictures.
[24:02.330 --> 24:05.310]  There's no way that's impossible.
[24:05.670 --> 24:07.390]  Unless you like spread the lip.
[24:07.530 --> 24:08.630]  I don't know what you're doing, bud.
[24:08.710 --> 24:10.690]  Like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[24:10.790 --> 24:11.430]  Oh, my God.
[24:11.430 --> 24:12.710]  Gracie, look away.
[24:12.850 --> 24:14.550]  You know, there's more.
[24:15.370 --> 24:16.570]  That one's way over there.
[24:16.570 --> 24:21.410]  Oh, God, oh, that's way worse.
[24:21.450 --> 24:25.390]  Tracy, don't look, do not look, do not look.
[24:25.610 --> 24:27.530]  You can't post this.
[24:27.950 --> 24:28.550]  We cannot.
[24:28.850 --> 24:30.210]  These have to stay here.
[24:30.970 --> 24:32.310]  These have to stay here.
[24:32.610 --> 24:34.650]  There's an extra life I got bruised.
[24:34.810 --> 24:37.730]  Yeah, but can I take a picture of my underwear on?
[24:38.590 --> 24:40.730]  He is where you can see his underwear.
[24:41.110 --> 24:42.130]  He is wearing it.
[24:42.130 --> 24:44.130]  It's just right next to his vaginal lips.
[24:44.130 --> 24:49.070]  I just covered my underwear with my vagina.
[24:49.250 --> 24:50.970]  It made it so much worse.
[24:51.130 --> 24:52.810]  It looks like brachialis panties.
[24:53.390 --> 24:54.350]  Oh, my.
[24:54.810 --> 24:56.390]  I don't know how I did that.
[24:56.750 --> 24:58.190]  That was so unintentional.
[24:58.370 --> 24:58.790]  Hey, Gav.
[24:59.410 --> 25:00.570]  Yeah. You got plans tonight?
[25:04.070 --> 25:05.630]  Now I get my review from Jeff.
[25:08.210 --> 25:09.170]  Oh, God.
[25:09.430 --> 25:11.610]  This is Jeff giving a photo review.
[25:12.170 --> 25:14.470]  Also, it didn't sound like Gracie looked away.
[25:15.030 --> 25:16.230]  I don't think so.
[25:16.630 --> 25:18.390]  Great. I think Gracie was locked in.
[25:19.010 --> 25:20.210]  Gracie was real locked in.
[25:20.210 --> 25:21.390]  Oh, yeah. She sounded vaulted.
[25:21.610 --> 25:22.910]  That was a definite vaulted in.
[25:23.710 --> 25:23.950]  Yeah.
[25:24.610 --> 25:25.410]  Full lives on screen.
[25:26.290 --> 25:26.750]  Sorry.
[25:26.950 --> 25:27.510]  We'll lose.
[25:28.630 --> 25:32.890]  Whether it's a movie night or just midday, Skinny Pop is a salty snack
[25:32.890 --> 25:33.970]  that keeps on giving.
[25:34.550 --> 25:38.470]  Made with just three simple ingredients for an irresistibly
[25:38.470 --> 25:42.290]  delicious taste and a large serving size that lasts.
[25:43.130 --> 25:45.510]  Deliciously popped, perfectly salted.
[25:46.130 --> 25:48.290]  Skinny Pop, popular for a reason.
[25:48.950 --> 25:50.150]  Shop Skinny Pop now.
[25:51.850 --> 25:56.530]  I'm a kid, so am I going to surprise you with a poster board I need for the science fair tomorrow?
[25:56.810 --> 25:57.210]  Probably.
[25:57.510 --> 26:01.070]  But can you get up to 40% off back to school essentials on Uber Eats?
[26:01.310 --> 26:01.690]  Definitely.
[26:02.270 --> 26:05.210]  So order on Uber Eats and get up to 40% off.
[26:05.430 --> 26:06.130]  Exclusions may apply.
[26:06.210 --> 26:06.910]  Check out for availability.
[26:06.910 --> 26:10.750]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[26:11.110 --> 26:13.990]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love.
[26:14.090 --> 26:17.670]  Now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[26:18.110 --> 26:19.550]  Available for a limited time.
[26:19.810 --> 26:21.930]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[26:22.410 --> 26:25.430]  Does anybody else have any housekeeping or anything else they want to...
[26:25.430 --> 26:30.090]  I have another thing I was going to go through as well, like loose ends kind of thing.
[26:30.170 --> 26:32.930]  But I want to give anybody else the opportunity to...
[26:32.930 --> 26:37.630]  I never figured out bog roll folders, which is unfortunate.
[26:37.810 --> 26:38.730]  I'll keep thinking about that.
[26:38.790 --> 26:40.150]  But that's one of the few things.
[26:40.670 --> 26:42.130]  Yeah, no, I don't really have any.
[26:42.430 --> 26:44.130]  So we all keep notes files, right?
[26:44.230 --> 26:44.930]  Gavin, I've seen yours.
[26:45.130 --> 26:46.850]  It's ridiculously long.
[26:47.770 --> 26:49.930]  I have a big long notes file too.
[26:50.670 --> 26:54.770]  And I thought like, because we're going to flip over to do the new thing,
[26:55.050 --> 26:57.470]  maybe it'd be good to turn over a new leaf, have a fresh start.
[26:57.950 --> 27:02.250]  And so I was thinking, I'm just going to get rid of those notes and just start a new fresh file.
[27:02.250 --> 27:06.850]  And everything new we'll talk about will be new ideas and new thoughts.
[27:07.490 --> 27:09.770]  And just flush out that old stuff, because we never got to it.
[27:09.810 --> 27:11.830]  It was obviously never important enough to make it into an episode.
[27:12.190 --> 27:13.870]  So why hang on to it, right?
[27:14.270 --> 27:17.610]  But I thought I'd go back and look through all of my old notes that we never talked about
[27:17.610 --> 27:20.770]  and just see if there was one or two or three things that might be fun to discuss.
[27:21.210 --> 27:25.910]  So I pulled out four things that I either never talked about or only began to talk about,
[27:25.950 --> 27:27.450]  but never really followed up on.
[27:28.010 --> 27:29.870]  And I'm just going to say them all now.
[27:29.870 --> 27:32.890]  And then instead of taking them one by one and giving each one space,
[27:32.950 --> 27:34.910]  I thought maybe we could... I'd throw them all out there.
[27:34.970 --> 27:38.090]  And then if any of them are interesting, then we could explore it.
[27:38.490 --> 27:38.990]  Does that make sense?
[27:39.590 --> 27:39.910]  Yes.
[27:40.350 --> 27:40.550]  Okay.
[27:41.490 --> 27:46.250]  First one was, do you think you've eaten more pizza or hamburgers in your life?
[27:47.410 --> 27:51.930]  And in addition to that, what is the thing you think you've eaten the most of in your life?
[27:51.950 --> 27:54.590]  And what do you think is more popular globally, pizza or hamburgers?
[27:54.590 --> 27:59.790]  The next one idea I had was, I think that it would be a good idea...
[27:59.790 --> 28:01.050]  Wait, wait, wait, do we need to tackle that?
[28:01.190 --> 28:03.270]  Let's talk about that, the first one first.
[28:03.530 --> 28:05.550]  So you want to take them one by one then, okay.
[28:05.870 --> 28:06.910]  Pizza, definitely pizza.
[28:07.250 --> 28:08.450]  Definitely eating more pizza.
[28:09.270 --> 28:10.090]  Yeah, pizza.
[28:10.610 --> 28:11.850]  Pizza's been consumed more.
[28:12.350 --> 28:14.710]  The thing I've eaten the most of undeniably is chicken.
[28:15.510 --> 28:17.930]  Specifically like chicken nuggets or strips.
[28:18.810 --> 28:19.190]  Devouring those things.
[28:19.190 --> 28:21.870]  Mine would be penne pasta.
[28:22.670 --> 28:23.270]  Penne.
[28:24.430 --> 28:25.970]  What did you say, penne?
[28:26.430 --> 28:27.030]  Penne?
[28:27.910 --> 28:28.750]  Sean Penney?
[28:30.170 --> 28:33.790]  I think mine might be hamburgers to both.
[28:34.750 --> 28:35.350]  Really?
[28:35.990 --> 28:39.250]  I think I've eaten peanut butter the most probably.
[28:39.390 --> 28:43.070]  You've eaten, by weight, more peanut butter than anything else?
[28:44.150 --> 28:45.150]  Yeah, maybe.
[28:45.410 --> 28:46.230]  Peanut butter's dense.
[28:47.030 --> 28:49.210]  It's very dense, and I'm just thinking...
[28:49.210 --> 28:49.950]  Peanut butter's never the most.
[28:49.950 --> 28:52.010]  Not in my adult life.
[28:52.590 --> 28:53.370]  That's wrong.
[28:53.870 --> 28:57.290]  In my adult life, not eating peanut butter super on the regular.
[28:57.650 --> 29:01.970]  As a kid, full peanut butter meals, dude.
[29:02.490 --> 29:05.790]  Yeah, but peanut butter would never be more than 50% of the meal.
[29:06.290 --> 29:07.350]  No, you're wrong.
[29:07.830 --> 29:09.250]  I don't agree with that whatsoever.
[29:09.250 --> 29:12.250]  You've never just shoved the spoon in a jar of peanut butter?
[29:12.550 --> 29:13.710]  Yeah, done that a lot.
[29:13.950 --> 29:15.810]  Apple slice, scooping the peanut butter.
[29:16.430 --> 29:18.790]  Like going insane mode on peanut butter.
[29:18.790 --> 29:20.770]  No, no, no, no.
[29:20.770 --> 29:21.730]  Nah, you're eating it wrong.
[29:21.950 --> 29:23.290]  Yeah, you're eating it all fucked up.
[29:23.290 --> 29:28.330]  So you have a slice of apple, and then you scoop more than that slice of peanut butter?
[29:28.810 --> 29:28.910]  Yes.
[29:30.290 --> 29:37.250]  One slice of apple probably equals two slice size of peanut butter when it's all said and done.
[29:37.270 --> 29:39.850]  How does the maths of that even work out?
[29:40.550 --> 29:41.030]  Deliciously.
[29:41.030 --> 29:47.370]  You scoop the peanut butter with the apple slice, and it's a lot.
[29:47.370 --> 29:53.410]  And you take a bite of that, and then you have half an apple slice, and then you do it one more time with that apple slice.
[29:53.690 --> 29:55.010]  So you're double dipping for sure.
[29:55.430 --> 29:57.710]  No, you flip the apple slice around the other way.
[29:57.770 --> 29:57.970]  Yeah.
[29:58.670 --> 30:01.350]  Or it's your fucking house, double dip if you want to.
[30:01.370 --> 30:05.570]  That is true. Also, I'm eight years old, so God's dead and none of it matters.
[30:05.650 --> 30:07.030]  Like, I'm just going for it.
[30:08.390 --> 30:11.350]  Yeah, I think it's probably peanut butter for me, number one.
[30:11.730 --> 30:12.350]  There's no way.
[30:13.010 --> 30:19.770]  So, like, for me, my entire life, I feel like when I think lunch, I think, oh, what hamburger am I going to eat today?
[30:21.250 --> 30:21.610]  Really?
[30:22.990 --> 30:24.910]  It's the first food I think of.
[30:25.350 --> 30:25.710]  Yeah.
[30:26.110 --> 30:29.930]  It's not my favorite or anything, but like, if I'm just thinking like, oh, I'm getting a little hungry.
[30:30.450 --> 30:33.330]  Do I want to eat a Billy's today, or do I want to go to the Pool Burger?
[30:33.730 --> 30:38.950]  But if you're talking just like what's around the house, I feel like you always can make a sandwich.
[30:39.050 --> 30:40.510]  You can't always make a hamburger.
[30:41.210 --> 30:42.650]  Oh, you don't know what's in my fridge.
[30:43.630 --> 30:44.430]  If I...
[30:44.430 --> 30:45.590]  I'm always ready for burger time.
[30:46.230 --> 30:47.850]  So you could make a burger right now.
[30:48.090 --> 30:49.730]  I could, yeah, absolutely.
[30:52.130 --> 30:54.870]  How many of us could make a burger right now if we wanted to?
[30:54.950 --> 30:55.330]  I could.
[30:56.410 --> 30:57.510]  I absolutely could.
[30:58.410 --> 31:00.570]  Everybody. It's fantastic.
[31:01.270 --> 31:01.930]  Well, everyone except me.
[31:02.650 --> 31:03.590]  Well, yeah, but you don't count.
[31:04.110 --> 31:08.290]  I could probably make a bacon and jalapeno cheeseburger right now.
[31:08.290 --> 31:10.710]  If I wanted to.
[31:11.250 --> 31:12.430]  Have you ever had peanut butter on a burger?
[31:12.690 --> 31:14.090]  I feel like that's a trendy thing.
[31:14.830 --> 31:15.930]  No, never heard it.
[31:16.070 --> 31:17.830]  Yes, I have. Is it good?
[31:18.230 --> 31:19.670]  It's fine. It's okay.
[31:20.430 --> 31:21.350]  Yeah, it's whatever.
[31:22.070 --> 31:25.810]  Okay, so everybody seems to think they've eaten more pizza in their life than hamburgers.
[31:25.990 --> 31:27.270]  That's cool. That's interesting.
[31:27.390 --> 31:28.370]  I'm hamburgers over pizza.
[31:28.750 --> 31:31.070]  Oh, right, you were a hamburger. I think I'm probably hamburgers as well.
[31:31.150 --> 31:32.250]  Definitely hamburgers as well.
[31:32.250 --> 31:34.930]  The second thing I had is...
[31:34.930 --> 31:35.810]  I think it's...
[31:35.810 --> 31:37.770]  We should investigate someday.
[31:37.870 --> 31:39.410]  You know how Michelin got started?
[31:39.730 --> 31:40.910]  And now it's just the tire company.
[31:41.030 --> 31:42.350]  But now they're like the Michelin.
[31:42.510 --> 31:43.890]  They issue the stars.
[31:44.270 --> 31:48.390]  And they're like the subject matter experts on food.
[31:49.370 --> 31:49.670]  Yeah.
[31:49.950 --> 31:51.750]  But they just started as a tire company.
[31:51.970 --> 31:55.290]  Or like Guinness is a beer company that also does the world records.
[31:56.650 --> 31:58.450]  Why don't we create...
[31:59.910 --> 32:00.730]  Everything okay?
[32:01.230 --> 32:02.850]  No, I just never put that together.
[32:03.010 --> 32:03.930]  That's crazy.
[32:04.930 --> 32:06.450]  I never thought about it.
[32:06.910 --> 32:07.170]  Wow.
[32:07.530 --> 32:10.710]  People were arguing over Guinness all the time.
[32:11.070 --> 32:11.450]  About shit.
[32:11.570 --> 32:14.550]  And so they just decided to create the book that settles all the arguments.
[32:15.790 --> 32:19.090]  We should create a national hot dog registry.
[32:19.710 --> 32:24.770]  Where all the best hot dogs that are made in North America are listed.
[32:24.770 --> 32:29.610]  And so if you go to a strange town, you can pull up the registry and go,
[32:29.690 --> 32:33.090]  Oh, I know there's three good hot dogs within eight miles of me.
[32:34.050 --> 32:38.810]  So it would be like that Moriarty app for escape rooms, but just for hot dogs.
[32:38.850 --> 32:39.850]  Yes, exactly.
[32:40.110 --> 32:42.910]  And then maybe at some point, if we develop a little bit of cachet,
[32:42.990 --> 32:45.150]  it becomes like a Michelin for hot dogs.
[32:45.210 --> 32:50.330]  And you get your hot dog like three regulation rated or whatever.
[32:50.470 --> 32:51.650]  And then it's like, it's a big deal.
[32:52.790 --> 32:54.110]  We could have an awards ceremony.
[32:55.090 --> 32:55.850]  I love it.
[32:55.950 --> 32:56.270]  Yeah.
[32:56.790 --> 32:57.990]  Something to think about going forward.
[32:58.090 --> 32:59.110]  Is that going to be a uniform thing?
[32:59.870 --> 33:02.610]  A uniform or regulation thing. Yeah, I think probably.
[33:02.790 --> 33:05.630]  Just kind of like a regulation. Yeah, I think that's not a bad idea.
[33:06.310 --> 33:08.210]  The next thing I had, we're almost done.
[33:08.250 --> 33:08.730]  I only have two more.
[33:09.130 --> 33:12.790]  The next thing is, do you guys think we should make toothpicks a thing again?
[33:14.470 --> 33:16.070]  Oh, I've been a big toothpick guy.
[33:17.330 --> 33:17.610]  Recently.
[33:18.210 --> 33:21.530]  I feel like I was way into toothpicks when I was a kid.
[33:21.650 --> 33:23.170]  And I was watching Masters of the Air.
[33:23.710 --> 33:26.050]  And since they don't let anybody smoke cigarettes anymore,
[33:26.290 --> 33:27.290]  even in the past,
[33:27.470 --> 33:28.770]  when people actually smoked cigarettes,
[33:28.870 --> 33:30.610]  they all just have like toothpicks in their mouths.
[33:31.470 --> 33:33.670]  And I got me thinking, toothpicks are pretty fucking cool.
[33:33.750 --> 33:36.010]  Especially the flavored ones, like a cinnamon toothpick.
[33:36.810 --> 33:37.590]  That's pretty nice.
[33:37.690 --> 33:39.090]  You want to get into flavored toothpicks?
[33:39.450 --> 33:41.750]  Maybe, like maybe we could contemporize toothpicks.
[33:42.710 --> 33:46.230]  Oh, maybe we should make our own flavors and saturate our toothpicks.
[33:46.270 --> 33:47.110]  And then we'll try them.
[33:47.590 --> 33:49.390]  Like a waffle bomb toothpick.
[33:49.390 --> 33:50.210]  Yeah.
[33:50.810 --> 33:51.690]  Oh god.
[33:52.610 --> 33:56.190]  I feel like those little floss pick things have outdone them.
[33:56.990 --> 33:58.490]  Yeah, I think they're a fad.
[33:59.190 --> 34:00.730]  Yeah, well, I don't.
[34:00.870 --> 34:03.410]  I think the flosser picks are here to stay.
[34:03.670 --> 34:05.230]  I know, but...
[34:05.230 --> 34:07.870]  I associate toothpicks with like
[34:07.870 --> 34:09.730]  long haul truckers.
[34:09.770 --> 34:10.750]  You know what I mean?
[34:10.850 --> 34:13.190]  Like they're dipping them
[34:13.190 --> 34:14.470]  and like staying up.
[34:15.450 --> 34:16.410]  Here's our play.
[34:16.410 --> 34:17.330]  Here's our play.
[34:17.830 --> 34:19.410]  You can dip them to stay up.
[34:19.790 --> 34:20.930]  Easy, that's true.
[34:21.510 --> 34:23.770]  Two, those flossers you're talking about,
[34:23.890 --> 34:25.730]  they're plastic full of microplastics.
[34:25.990 --> 34:28.230]  Every time you use it, you're probably poisoning your mouth.
[34:28.830 --> 34:30.830]  You're getting down there in your nether regions
[34:30.830 --> 34:32.250]  and just filling it with microplastics.
[34:32.370 --> 34:33.950]  We need to return to wood.
[34:34.170 --> 34:36.470]  If you're going to put it in your mouth, it needs to be wood.
[34:37.750 --> 34:39.790]  I think Gracie has a great point, which is
[34:39.790 --> 34:41.950]  we need to bring back a piece of wheat in your mouth.
[34:42.510 --> 34:44.010]  We need to go back even further.
[34:44.010 --> 34:45.170]  That's good too.
[34:45.810 --> 34:47.490]  Where do you get wheat from?
[34:47.990 --> 34:48.690]  Is that Buckley?
[34:54.610 --> 35:02.100]  Okay, last thing I have.
[35:02.320 --> 35:04.000]  And then I'm done and I'm going to close the books
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.860]  on all my f*** face ideas and delete the file.
[35:08.920 --> 35:10.040]  As you guys know,
[35:10.220 --> 35:11.300]  I'm a big TikToker now.
[35:11.380 --> 35:13.020]  Now that the government doesn't like it, I like it.
[35:13.840 --> 35:14.580]  And so,
[35:14.800 --> 35:16.240]  I've been watching a ton of TikTok.
[35:17.120 --> 35:19.920]  And I think that there's a market there.
[35:19.980 --> 35:20.780]  Because we're clever.
[35:20.920 --> 35:22.420]  We're clever people, right?
[35:22.760 --> 35:23.740]  We're very smart.
[35:23.900 --> 35:25.460]  We make games and ideas.
[35:26.020 --> 35:27.840]  Think of all the games we made in Minecraft, Gavin.
[35:27.880 --> 35:28.840]  Think of all that work we've done.
[35:28.880 --> 35:30.360]  Think of all the clever things we've invented.
[35:30.760 --> 35:33.500]  TikTok is awash with made-up sports
[35:33.500 --> 35:35.400]  that people are inventing themselves.
[35:35.540 --> 35:37.160]  There's the pool balls on the treadmill.
[35:37.700 --> 35:39.840]  There's the people that race marbles.
[35:39.840 --> 35:42.120]  There's the dudes that swing bottles
[35:42.120 --> 35:43.860]  at each other and see which one breaks.
[35:43.960 --> 35:46.500]  I feel like, between the five of us,
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.100]  we could create the next
[35:48.100 --> 35:50.080]  great TikTok sport.
[35:52.540 --> 35:53.140]  That's all.
[35:53.200 --> 35:54.120]  I agree with that.
[35:54.420 --> 35:57.020]  An immediate thought that came from that statement is
[35:57.020 --> 35:59.480]  there's sort of this common vernacular of like
[35:59.480 --> 36:01.800]  street smarts versus school smarts.
[36:02.040 --> 36:03.640]  How would you categorize your
[36:03.640 --> 36:05.680]  Minecraft smarts that you're presenting?
[36:06.200 --> 36:07.860]  The ability to make game modes.
[36:07.860 --> 36:08.940]  Nerd smarts.
[36:09.020 --> 36:11.800]  Nerd smarts? Okay. I actually like that. That was good.
[36:12.100 --> 36:13.480]  I feel like we should
[36:13.480 --> 36:14.920]  rent a steamroller.
[36:15.400 --> 36:15.920]  Right?
[36:17.020 --> 36:18.620]  That's all I've got so far.
[36:21.040 --> 36:22.760]  We should rent a steamroller
[36:22.760 --> 36:25.900]  and then try to flatten and then unflatten things.
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.400]  What's the difference between a steamroller
[36:29.400 --> 36:31.380]  and an iron? Is it just scale?
[36:31.920 --> 36:33.360]  Couple hundred thousand pounds.
[36:33.660 --> 36:34.760]  What do you mean?
[36:34.760 --> 36:37.080]  Do you want to get into like steamrolling
[36:37.080 --> 36:37.680]  your underwear?
[36:38.220 --> 36:41.120]  I don't really know what a steamroller does.
[36:41.280 --> 36:42.700]  Could you iron a shirt properly
[36:42.700 --> 36:43.400]  with a steamroller?
[36:43.640 --> 36:47.000]  Let's get an ironing board and a shirt and a steamroller
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.040]  and see if we get better results than an iron.
[36:50.700 --> 36:53.040]  Well, it's functionally supposed to be the same, right?
[36:53.100 --> 36:54.120]  It's just like a larger version.
[36:55.020 --> 36:56.800]  You could do your entire
[36:56.800 --> 36:58.380]  wardrobe in one roll.
[36:59.760 --> 37:00.600]  Let's get into
[37:00.600 --> 37:02.140]  really long ironing boards.
[37:03.540 --> 37:04.020]  Or
[37:04.740 --> 37:06.940]  let's make a steamrolling iron
[37:07.660 --> 37:09.240]  that's like a little mini steamroller
[37:09.240 --> 37:10.280]  that you can iron.
[37:11.100 --> 37:12.380]  Oh, we'll make it really heavy.
[37:12.480 --> 37:13.880]  We'll make it out of like tungsten.
[37:14.900 --> 37:15.860]  Heated tungsten.
[37:16.220 --> 37:16.940]  Oh, God.
[37:17.920 --> 37:19.840]  Let's make the most premium
[37:20.520 --> 37:22.660]  automated iron the world has ever seen.
[37:24.840 --> 37:26.500]  I think it's a great idea.
[37:26.900 --> 37:27.920]  And if it's remote control
[37:27.920 --> 37:30.000]  and we can drive it back and forth
[37:30.000 --> 37:31.460]  over the ironing board so you don't have to
[37:31.920 --> 37:33.560]  use your own pressure. Oh, this is awesome.
[37:33.980 --> 37:35.940]  You went through a little phase of wanting to get into
[37:35.940 --> 37:37.460]  RC cars. Still do.
[37:37.700 --> 37:40.020]  This could combine into that.
[37:41.080 --> 37:41.420]  By the way,
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.020]  that's on the back burner, but that's very much
[37:44.020 --> 37:45.560]  still, the pin is still in it.
[37:45.820 --> 37:47.820]  I don't know if you guys remember,
[37:47.940 --> 37:48.860]  but we all lost our jobs.
[37:49.100 --> 37:51.860]  Yeah, it really took the wind out of the sails
[37:51.860 --> 37:53.460]  of the high-end RC car idea.
[37:53.900 --> 37:55.940]  Yeah, those $800 RC cars
[37:55.940 --> 37:57.680]  started looking a lot less interesting
[37:58.880 --> 38:00.100]  over the last month or so.
[38:00.560 --> 38:01.920]  We'll get back there. We'll get back.
[38:02.360 --> 38:02.800]  Maybe.
[38:06.440 --> 38:07.760]  So who's in charge of
[38:07.760 --> 38:09.100]  all the money at the next thing?
[38:11.560 --> 38:13.240]  Not it. Not it.
[38:13.820 --> 38:14.220]  Not it.
[38:15.400 --> 38:17.700]  We're hiring a company
[38:18.540 --> 38:19.500]  to be in charge of.
[38:19.800 --> 38:21.700]  Because we say
[38:21.700 --> 38:23.560]  who's in charge of all the money,
[38:23.740 --> 38:25.860]  which makes me think that none of us should be in charge
[38:25.860 --> 38:26.760]  of all the money.
[38:26.880 --> 38:27.320]  What do you mean?
[38:29.360 --> 38:31.440]  I was immediately thinking, how do I
[38:31.440 --> 38:34.120]  spend $4,500 on a block of tungsten?
[38:34.680 --> 38:35.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[38:36.880 --> 38:37.880]  I didn't say
[38:37.880 --> 38:39.960]  not me because I felt I disqualified
[38:39.960 --> 38:41.800]  myself by asking what's the difference
[38:41.800 --> 38:43.260]  between an iron and a steamroller.
[38:43.420 --> 38:45.420]  I felt that made it clear that
[38:45.420 --> 38:47.980]  I'm not in the running for this race. That's okay.
[38:50.940 --> 38:51.960]  Oh, we're fucked.
[38:51.960 --> 38:52.980]  Oh, man.
[38:54.580 --> 38:55.500]  We're gonna try.
[38:57.840 --> 39:00.000]  I've got so many notes that I either don't
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.380]  understand or have no idea if I've ever brought up.
[39:02.460 --> 39:03.960]  I love it. Let's do it.
[39:04.140 --> 39:04.900]  Hit me with it.
[39:05.140 --> 39:07.100]  What is Andrew confused about bats?
[39:08.720 --> 39:11.540]  What is Andrew confused about bats?
[39:11.660 --> 39:13.080]  Did I text you about bats, maybe?
[39:14.140 --> 39:16.020]  Spit take thinking about alien
[39:16.020 --> 39:16.480]  pussy.
[39:17.000 --> 39:20.040]  Oh, was that from our...
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.040]  Was that from our...
[39:21.900 --> 39:22.900]  smut that we wrote?
[39:23.600 --> 39:25.840]  No, this is years ago, baby.
[39:26.720 --> 39:27.760]  Advert for milk.
[39:29.040 --> 39:29.920]  Quarantine pasta.
[39:31.120 --> 39:31.880]  Wasp fan.
[39:32.260 --> 39:34.520]  Yeah, I don't know what any of this is.
[39:35.200 --> 39:36.060]  Wasp fan is
[39:36.060 --> 39:38.300]  when your fan got the wasp nest in it.
[39:38.720 --> 39:39.840]  Oh, an actual fan.
[39:40.240 --> 39:41.780]  Not someone who is a fan of wasps.
[39:41.940 --> 39:43.160]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[39:43.240 --> 39:45.800]  Gavin's notes list is like playing fucking connections
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.520]  or you're trying to interpret. Is it literal?
[39:47.520 --> 39:48.520]  Is it a saying?
[39:48.820 --> 39:51.160]  What is the context in which this word is being used?
[39:51.400 --> 39:52.980]  Is it a word that means multiple things?
[39:53.940 --> 39:55.700]  An outlet's off guy
[39:55.700 --> 39:56.460]  or not.
[39:56.840 --> 39:57.620]  A what?
[39:58.760 --> 40:01.020]  An outlet's off guy or not.
[40:02.020 --> 40:03.500]  Turn the outlets off, maybe?
[40:04.260 --> 40:05.280]  What does that mean there?
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.560]  Do you like trip the breaker on the outlet
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.840]  so that it's not active?
[40:10.260 --> 40:11.780]  Why would I be that kind of guy, though?
[40:12.120 --> 40:13.760]  Would that reduce your power bill,
[40:13.980 --> 40:15.000]  maybe? Your electric bill?
[40:15.000 --> 40:15.260]  No.
[40:16.680 --> 40:17.080]  Maybe.
[40:19.280 --> 40:21.000]  I can't be drawn any power.
[40:22.600 --> 40:23.360]  Well, it has to, right?
[40:23.480 --> 40:25.100]  Doesn't it always have to be technically?
[40:26.020 --> 40:27.500]  Yeah, but to be such a small amount,
[40:27.560 --> 40:28.060]  I don't know.
[40:28.720 --> 40:30.560]  Bag full of cocaine, nothing else.
[40:30.800 --> 40:32.900]  Oh, that was when I wanted to have a suitcase
[40:32.900 --> 40:34.900]  that was full to the brim
[40:34.900 --> 40:36.760]  of just cocaine powder
[40:36.760 --> 40:39.060]  to see if they could see it on the x-ray.
[40:42.300 --> 40:44.020]  Instead of it looking like a secret
[40:44.020 --> 40:46.460]  hidden compartment, it would just be entirely coke.
[40:48.060 --> 40:49.640]  I was wondering if that could get through.
[40:50.460 --> 40:52.340]  How much does an x-ray machine cost?
[40:57.140 --> 40:58.700]  You have to be able to buy those, right?
[40:58.780 --> 41:00.020]  I've never considered that.
[41:00.380 --> 41:02.580]  Well, the airports are getting rid of them all for those
[41:02.580 --> 41:05.320]  CT scanners now, so there's probably a bunch of
[41:05.320 --> 41:06.960]  x-ray shit on the market.
[41:07.920 --> 41:09.120]  Let's see, airport scanner cost.
[41:09.220 --> 41:11.140]  I have a question for you, Gavin, as we're wrapping up
[41:11.140 --> 41:12.680]  old things and
[41:14.040 --> 41:15.100]  f*** face territory
[41:15.100 --> 41:17.240]  thing that I've pretended to not care about
[41:17.240 --> 41:18.780]  but still think about.
[41:19.280 --> 41:20.640]  Is it the time in Halo
[41:20.640 --> 41:21.620]  that I have better than you still?
[41:21.980 --> 41:24.720]  No, it's a Halo-related thing, though.
[41:24.980 --> 41:26.300]  What was the word you made up?
[41:27.740 --> 41:28.900]  Do you remember?
[41:29.740 --> 41:30.640]  What was the made-up word?
[41:31.680 --> 41:31.960]  Oh.
[41:33.220 --> 41:34.460]  You told us.
[41:34.660 --> 41:35.800]  Made up
[41:37.120 --> 41:37.600]  word.
[41:38.140 --> 41:41.040]  We're playing Halo, just to give context for this,
[41:41.040 --> 41:42.860]  and Gavin tried to...
[41:42.860 --> 41:44.980]  He said, you ever hear about... and then he said
[41:44.980 --> 41:47.300]  a word, and I was like, that's... he just made that up.
[41:47.400 --> 41:49.100]  That's fake. And he immediately folded.
[41:49.620 --> 41:51.300]  But then I forgot what it was called.
[41:51.960 --> 41:52.740]  And he refused to tell me.
[41:52.740 --> 41:55.180]  Yeah, and then I wrote it for everyone else, didn't I?
[41:55.220 --> 41:57.080]  Yeah, I took a picture of it or something,
[41:57.180 --> 41:58.360]  but I don't know how I'd find it.
[41:58.880 --> 42:01.020]  But I don't remember... I pretended like
[42:01.020 --> 42:02.700]  I haven't cared when I have,
[42:02.800 --> 42:04.500]  so I thought...
[42:04.500 --> 42:06.680]  I just remembered. What was the word?
[42:09.180 --> 42:09.660]  Jazzle.
[42:09.780 --> 42:10.640]  It can't be jazzle.
[42:10.900 --> 42:12.200]  That's Jeff's new favorite.
[42:13.240 --> 42:14.380]  Jizzle? NBA term.
[42:14.680 --> 42:14.980]  Yeah.
[42:16.020 --> 42:18.520]  But I've sent it in a text to Jeff
[42:18.520 --> 42:19.320]  and Eric, maybe?
[42:20.060 --> 42:22.040]  I think you sent a photo of it.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.680]  If the end of this arc is you
[42:24.680 --> 42:26.460]  not knowing it and being unable to find it,
[42:26.480 --> 42:28.100]  I'm totally okay with that. That's great.
[42:28.340 --> 42:28.840]  I'm happy.
[42:30.120 --> 42:31.920]  What would it have begun with?
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.260]  Great question. I've been wondering the same.
[42:34.640 --> 42:36.040]  This is the word that we were saying,
[42:36.140 --> 42:37.480]  or this is the word that Gavin made up?
[42:38.100 --> 42:39.140]  Oh, I forgot about that!
[42:40.060 --> 42:41.020]  Wait, which one was that?
[42:41.600 --> 42:41.920]  Nothing.
[42:46.180 --> 42:47.460]  I forgot about that!
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.060]  That's unrelated. Don't worry about that, Gavin.
[42:50.560 --> 42:51.540]  Is that something I don't know about?
[42:52.060 --> 42:53.560]  No, just keep trying to find your word.
[42:53.940 --> 42:54.780]  Yeah, what's your word, Gavin?
[42:54.940 --> 42:56.780]  We got multiple words in the mix?
[42:58.260 --> 43:00.520]  I mean, not if you can't remember your word.
[43:01.040 --> 43:01.440]  Huh.
[43:03.220 --> 43:04.900]  I guess that depends on you, doesn't it?
[43:05.740 --> 43:06.580]  I did see
[43:06.580 --> 43:08.120]  one subreddit thread about
[43:08.120 --> 43:10.500]  r-word, and it made me very happy, where they're
[43:10.500 --> 43:12.560]  just like, hey, he's really trying to make that a thing.
[43:13.880 --> 43:14.720]  Oh, I found my list
[43:14.720 --> 43:16.120]  of punchlines without
[43:17.540 --> 43:17.940]  setups.
[43:18.660 --> 43:19.360]  That's my wife!
[43:20.160 --> 43:21.740]  That's not a goose, that's my wife!
[43:25.140 --> 43:26.440]  That's a newspaper with legs.
[43:27.820 --> 43:28.600]  One of my notes just
[43:28.600 --> 43:30.340]  says Alanis Morissette.
[43:30.460 --> 43:31.020]  What's that about?
[43:32.920 --> 43:34.120]  Was that feet related?
[43:35.760 --> 43:36.400]  I don't know.
[43:38.540 --> 43:40.440]  What year was that word?
[43:43.440 --> 43:44.700]  This is the best case
[43:44.700 --> 43:46.500]  scenario for me. I'm so happy I asked.
[43:49.080 --> 43:50.520]  I can't say. I don't know.
[43:52.100 --> 43:52.620]  I definitely
[43:52.620 --> 43:54.600]  made some guesses in our text chain, if you want
[43:54.600 --> 43:55.180]  to point a reference.
[43:56.260 --> 43:57.120]  What were the guesses?
[43:58.380 --> 43:59.340]  I don't even know
[43:59.340 --> 44:01.240]  the word. You think I know my guesses that were wrong?
[44:02.220 --> 44:03.320]  Fuck. Do we know what
[44:03.320 --> 44:03.980]  year it was?
[44:08.190 --> 44:09.230]  Well, while you think about that,
[44:09.330 --> 44:09.810]  I have a clip.
[44:10.650 --> 44:11.490]  Oh my god.
[44:13.570 --> 44:15.350]  Did you find it, Gavin, or was that a reaction
[44:15.350 --> 44:16.770]  to my clip? That was your clip.
[44:18.590 --> 44:19.310]  It's not...
[44:19.710 --> 44:21.070]  It's an unrelated Sea Thieves
[44:21.070 --> 44:23.330]  story, but it is a very funny
[44:23.330 --> 44:25.030]  clip that I would like to share.
[44:25.990 --> 44:26.450]  Sea
[44:27.170 --> 44:28.430]  Thieves, you have an emote
[44:28.430 --> 44:30.490]  where you can hide in a barrel
[44:31.030 --> 44:32.730]  and so the goal is to sneak into
[44:32.730 --> 44:34.350]  somebody's ship and then barrel emote
[44:34.350 --> 44:35.610]  and be sneaky.
[44:36.350 --> 44:42.910]  I snuck into a boat
[44:42.910 --> 44:43.750]  and I thought,
[44:43.870 --> 44:46.630]  I'm so well placed, they will
[44:46.630 --> 44:48.630]  never know that I'm here.
[44:48.850 --> 44:49.750]  And here's a link to the clip.
[44:50.510 --> 44:51.610]  I don't think it shows it.
[44:52.590 --> 44:53.590]  Before that clip
[44:53.590 --> 44:55.830]  begins, one of them ran
[44:55.830 --> 44:57.250]  down into this area
[44:57.850 --> 44:59.590]  and then ran back upstairs
[44:59.590 --> 45:01.010]  and I thought, I am in the clear.
[45:01.430 --> 45:02.390]  Let me know when you watch the clip.
[45:05.570 --> 45:06.430]  Oh yeah, good.
[45:08.290 --> 45:09.410]  Yeah, that's a good spot.
[45:10.190 --> 45:11.710]  Yeah, so I'm like, ah, this is a great
[45:11.710 --> 45:12.690]  position I'm in.
[45:13.570 --> 45:14.930]  It's like you're playing prop hunt.
[45:15.670 --> 45:17.170]  It is like I'm playing prop hunt.
[45:17.310 --> 45:18.890]  I'm like, it looks so natural.
[45:20.110 --> 45:21.010]  I really,
[45:21.970 --> 45:22.930]  I can't complain
[45:22.930 --> 45:24.490]  about this. I feel really secure.
[45:24.770 --> 45:26.270]  I'll just wait until they like
[45:26.830 --> 45:28.850]  selling stuff or looting later and then I'll
[45:28.850 --> 45:30.830]  pop out and I'll really get the
[45:30.830 --> 45:31.870]  upper hand on them.
[45:32.730 --> 45:33.670]  Show them a thing or two.
[45:34.770 --> 45:36.750]  And that is not what ended up
[45:36.750 --> 45:37.790]  happening at all.
[45:43.030 --> 45:44.110]  The guy,
[45:45.510 --> 45:46.950]  the guy ran
[45:46.950 --> 45:48.190]  past me once
[45:49.210 --> 45:50.870]  and he clearly was like,
[45:51.010 --> 45:52.610]  oh, this idiot is right there.
[45:52.750 --> 45:54.930]  So then he went up and he got his entire
[45:54.930 --> 45:56.870]  crew and they all came
[45:56.870 --> 45:58.850]  down together and he's like, this
[45:58.850 --> 46:01.010]  idiot. And then they blew me away.
[46:01.250 --> 46:02.750]  They all just melted
[46:02.750 --> 46:03.810]  with shotgun shots.
[46:04.130 --> 46:06.570]  That is terrifying. They all came.
[46:06.930 --> 46:08.650]  They all came. He's like, yeah, let's
[46:08.650 --> 46:10.310]  see this idiot there.
[46:10.570 --> 46:12.090]  I had no chance.
[46:13.050 --> 46:14.410]  Anyways, Sea of Thieves is great.
[46:14.410 --> 46:16.030]  I'm excited for us to play more of it.
[46:16.390 --> 46:17.830]  I don't have any other clips. I don't have any
[46:17.830 --> 46:19.790]  other past things.
[46:20.290 --> 46:21.190]  Gavin, did you figure out your word yet?
[46:22.030 --> 46:23.930]  No, I'm trying to look back through our texts.
[46:26.690 --> 46:27.790]  We text so much.
[46:28.430 --> 46:29.410]  Yeah, that's so many.
[46:30.130 --> 46:31.750]  We used to.
[46:31.850 --> 46:32.870]  Oh, that felt like a dig.
[46:34.790 --> 46:35.670]  What was the
[46:36.570 --> 46:37.850]  meaning of the word? Do you remember?
[46:38.730 --> 46:40.350]  No, I don't remember anything
[46:40.350 --> 46:42.410]  about it outside of...
[46:43.170 --> 46:44.130]  It was a really
[46:44.130 --> 46:45.930]  obviously fake sounding thing
[46:45.930 --> 46:48.170]  and then I forgot it. And then you
[46:48.170 --> 46:49.410]  refused to tell me.
[46:50.170 --> 46:50.570]  Christ.
[46:51.610 --> 46:54.130]  Waste the last episode fucking searching
[46:54.130 --> 46:54.810]  Gavin.
[46:57.570 --> 46:58.270]  It's crazy
[46:58.270 --> 46:59.930]  to think that this is the end. Like,
[46:59.970 --> 47:02.050]  obviously we've known for a long time. But not,
[47:02.210 --> 47:03.650]  you know, the end in the sense of
[47:04.310 --> 47:06.070]  this will be nothing to the audience.
[47:06.250 --> 47:08.330]  We're gonna be on a different feed
[47:08.730 --> 47:10.250]  on Wednesday. Everything will be the
[47:10.250 --> 47:12.190]  same. I mean, it doesn't feel like
[47:12.190 --> 47:14.150]  a ton for us either. Like, we're just gonna keep
[47:14.150 --> 47:16.010]  going. I don't know. It feels like an end to me.
[47:16.110 --> 47:18.110]  I think because of the company more so closing
[47:18.110 --> 47:19.770]  than necessarily because this.
[47:20.530 --> 47:21.530]  Like all of
[47:22.390 --> 47:24.190]  all of the closest friendships
[47:24.190 --> 47:26.030]  I have are connected through the company.
[47:26.230 --> 47:27.730]  It's just, it's crazy that that
[47:28.210 --> 47:29.350]  will cease to exist.
[47:30.170 --> 47:32.210]  It's weird to think that the thing that like
[47:32.210 --> 47:33.750]  meant so much to me
[47:34.310 --> 47:36.170]  that somebody who was my age when I
[47:36.170 --> 47:38.170]  found it just will not have that opportunity to
[47:38.170 --> 47:39.270]  find and have a similar journey.
[47:40.510 --> 47:41.730]  At least for that.
[47:41.990 --> 47:44.010]  We're building a new
[47:44.010 --> 47:44.830]  exciting thing.
[47:48.250 --> 47:50.190]  I was saying on the Rooster Teeth podcast
[47:50.190 --> 47:52.130]  that it really is
[47:52.130 --> 47:54.110]  I don't know, because I've
[47:54.110 --> 47:55.650]  grown up doing this really.
[47:56.030 --> 47:58.310]  But it is such an
[47:58.310 --> 47:59.910]  amazing feeling to have a platform
[47:59.910 --> 48:02.010]  where you can make people laugh. Like when people
[48:02.010 --> 48:04.130]  say that they like spat
[48:04.130 --> 48:06.030]  out their drink at something
[48:06.030 --> 48:08.150]  I said. I just can't
[48:08.150 --> 48:10.070]  beat that feeling. I think that's the reason I don't
[48:10.070 --> 48:11.210]  ever want to stop doing this.
[48:12.250 --> 48:13.990]  It might be the best feeling in the world.
[48:15.410 --> 48:16.030]  It's really
[48:16.030 --> 48:17.450]  yeah, it's an incredible feeling.
[48:18.210 --> 48:20.010]  Especially to get to do with people you love
[48:20.010 --> 48:21.830]  making stuff with. Like it's a double
[48:21.830 --> 48:23.850]  it is so rewarding
[48:23.850 --> 48:26.190]  personally and touching to know that
[48:26.730 --> 48:27.790]  we have a platform
[48:27.790 --> 48:29.650]  which allows us to connect with people
[48:29.650 --> 48:32.230]  and bring laughter to their day
[48:32.230 --> 48:33.930]  as well as just being able to bring
[48:33.930 --> 48:35.870]  laughter to people's days that I know
[48:35.870 --> 48:38.170]  and have a different relationship
[48:38.170 --> 48:38.550]  with.
[48:39.370 --> 48:42.090]  It's awesome. It's the best of both
[48:42.090 --> 48:42.570]  scenarios.
[48:43.710 --> 48:46.050]  I wrote a little thing to read
[48:46.810 --> 48:47.970]  as like a thank you to
[48:47.970 --> 48:49.070]  the audience and that type of thing.
[48:49.190 --> 48:51.450]  I decided to record it independently
[48:51.450 --> 48:52.510]  because I don't know
[48:53.110 --> 48:55.950]  I'm an easy crier and I'm glad I did.
[48:56.090 --> 48:56.850]  Jesus Christ.
[48:57.590 --> 48:58.350]  Messy boy.
[48:59.150 --> 49:00.770]  Did you have to do multiple takes?
[49:01.250 --> 49:02.730]  Okay, well Jesus Christ
[49:02.730 --> 49:04.250]  I felt like I was in a musical.
[49:04.510 --> 49:06.810]  You all just cry like a little baby.
[49:07.630 --> 49:08.830]  Just waiting for you
[49:08.830 --> 49:10.750]  to stop so we can all say our jokes.
[49:10.970 --> 49:12.490]  Yes, it was great.
[49:13.490 --> 49:14.570]  Okay, Geoff, joke one.
[49:15.190 --> 49:16.850]  I don't even remember
[49:16.850 --> 49:18.510]  what I asked. Eric, joke two.
[49:19.270 --> 49:20.950]  Was it the potato thing you already
[49:20.950 --> 49:21.850]  recorded? No.
[49:22.410 --> 49:24.050]  Did you cry like a baby?
[49:24.630 --> 49:26.690]  Was it embarrassing? Was it
[49:26.690 --> 49:28.890]  like sobbing or was it like dignified tears?
[49:28.890 --> 49:30.810]  It was, I think
[49:30.810 --> 49:32.890]  a good medium between dignified tears
[49:32.890 --> 49:33.950]  and baby tears.
[49:35.310 --> 49:36.130]  But it's, you know
[49:36.630 --> 49:38.270]  Well, it's not hard to do with me.
[49:38.450 --> 49:40.510]  Let me just say, as someone who's
[49:41.150 --> 49:42.750]  never cried on camera
[49:42.750 --> 49:44.650]  in his life, I'm
[49:44.650 --> 49:46.770]  disgusted by you.
[49:46.970 --> 49:48.170]  No hop-ups.
[49:48.710 --> 49:49.770]  What is a hop-up, Nick?
[49:50.350 --> 49:52.690]  You know when someone's crying
[49:52.690 --> 49:54.430]  so much and they're like...
[49:54.430 --> 49:56.250]  Oh, okay. Yeah, no.
[49:56.250 --> 49:58.210]  I didn't have that.
[49:58.530 --> 50:00.070]  I think the last time I had that was when I saw
[50:00.070 --> 50:02.210]  Me Earl and the Dying Girl. That one
[50:02.210 --> 50:02.890]  got me.
[50:03.510 --> 50:05.870]  I was bawling.
[50:05.870 --> 50:08.750]  I never saw that, but I guess she dies.
[50:09.050 --> 50:10.190]  Well, yeah, she dies
[50:10.190 --> 50:11.730]  and it hit.
[50:12.390 --> 50:14.170]  I don't know what it was, but that day it
[50:14.170 --> 50:16.350]  hit hard and it's the hardest
[50:16.350 --> 50:17.810]  I think I've cried in a movie
[50:17.810 --> 50:20.210]  and it was so bad that I had to start
[50:20.210 --> 50:22.070]  staring at the ceiling to gather
[50:22.070 --> 50:24.050]  myself because I was like, this is insane.
[50:24.050 --> 50:25.830]  This is ridiculous how much I'm crying.
[50:26.050 --> 50:28.110]  And I was like, okay. Okay, I'm all
[50:28.110 --> 50:30.150]  good. And I brought my eyes back down and she was
[50:30.150 --> 50:31.910]  still dying. And I went, oh no!
[50:32.190 --> 50:33.970]  Oh, back to the roof. I can't.
[50:34.750 --> 50:35.970]  Is that what that
[50:35.970 --> 50:38.070]  TV... I never watched it, but that My Name
[50:38.070 --> 50:40.070]  Is Earl show was about? He was apologizing
[50:40.070 --> 50:42.210]  to everybody because he killed
[50:42.210 --> 50:44.090]  that girl? It was like a mix
[50:44.090 --> 50:45.990]  between Me Earl and the Dying Girl and Dexter.
[50:46.210 --> 50:48.110]  He would kill a different person every
[50:48.110 --> 50:49.350]  week. Ew.
[50:50.310 --> 50:52.050]  Yeah. First season
[50:52.050 --> 50:54.070]  was great. John Lithgow.
[50:54.850 --> 50:55.970]  Do you know who's John Lithgow?
[50:56.330 --> 50:56.950]  And that gal?
[50:58.470 --> 51:00.150]  I saw him in an interview
[51:00.150 --> 51:02.030]  and he said John Lithgow and I went
[51:02.030 --> 51:04.010]  what the fuck? Do you cover
[51:04.010 --> 51:06.150]  that in your message to the audience? I do,
[51:06.290 --> 51:07.950]  yeah. That's actually what I both
[51:07.950 --> 51:10.110]  open and close with. Are we
[51:10.110 --> 51:12.010]  going to hear your message too? Are you going to
[51:12.010 --> 51:14.050]  play it for us or is it a thing? I'm not going to play it
[51:14.050 --> 51:16.030]  until it ends and
[51:16.030 --> 51:18.350]  then it'll tack on at the end of the episode. I'm going to send it to
[51:18.950 --> 51:19.750]  Kelly who
[51:19.750 --> 51:21.670]  edits this show and does a
[51:21.670 --> 51:23.890]  wonderful job. So we don't get to hear it
[51:23.890 --> 51:25.170]  until the audience does.
[51:26.510 --> 51:27.910]  Yeah. This is Kelly's
[51:27.910 --> 51:29.930]  last edit then, is it? It is, yeah.
[51:30.330 --> 51:31.650]  Aw. That sucks.
[51:32.730 --> 51:33.690]  Shout out to Kelly.
[51:34.090 --> 51:35.630]  Shout out to Kelly. Shout out to Kelly.
[51:35.670 --> 51:37.610]  Thank you, Kelly. Absolutely
[51:37.610 --> 51:39.250]  tremendous job. Every
[51:39.250 --> 51:40.990]  fucking week, week in, week out.
[51:41.590 --> 51:43.710]  Amazing editor and I think something that has
[51:43.710 --> 51:45.530]  added so much to our show that we've been
[51:45.530 --> 51:47.770]  lucky that so many of the people that have
[51:47.770 --> 51:49.830]  hands in it care about it and enjoy
[51:49.830 --> 51:51.250]  it. And I think that when
[51:51.650 --> 51:53.790]  you have that, it shows in the work.
[51:54.190 --> 51:55.650]  And get it as well, you know?
[51:55.650 --> 51:57.770]  Because humor is subjective
[51:57.770 --> 51:59.990]  and one of the things that I've learned over the last
[51:59.990 --> 52:01.470]  you know, however many,
[52:01.650 --> 52:03.670]  150 years of doing this is that an
[52:03.670 --> 52:05.910]  editor can absolutely make or break
[52:05.910 --> 52:07.570]  a production and
[52:07.570 --> 52:09.870]  the fact that Kelly 100%
[52:09.870 --> 52:11.450]  gets what we're doing
[52:12.150 --> 52:13.810]  and then is able to enhance it with
[52:13.810 --> 52:15.950]  her talents and abilities is fucking amazing.
[52:15.950 --> 52:17.790]  Can I ask a completely unrelated
[52:17.790 --> 52:20.230]  question? Do vitamins
[52:20.230 --> 52:22.050]  work? There's
[52:22.050 --> 52:23.890]  a lot of controversy over that. Are vitamins
[52:23.890 --> 52:25.930]  real? That a lot of people
[52:25.930 --> 52:27.790]  no, I don't think so.
[52:28.490 --> 52:29.230]  Great. Really?
[52:29.770 --> 52:31.330]  Is that different to like a supplement?
[52:31.950 --> 52:33.950]  Yeah, no. Supplements as well.
[52:34.410 --> 52:35.990]  Gracie said I've tried hundreds. What do you
[52:35.990 --> 52:37.770]  mean by that? Like I went through a really
[52:37.770 --> 52:39.690]  weird phase in college where
[52:39.690 --> 52:41.910]  I really wanted to find a vitamin that worked
[52:42.470 --> 52:43.950]  and so I bought...
[52:43.950 --> 52:45.670]  What do you mean by worked? Yeah, well how would you
[52:45.670 --> 52:46.110]  track that?
[52:48.350 --> 52:49.070]  For example,
[52:49.850 --> 52:51.310]  I would like feel better or some of them are
[52:51.310 --> 52:53.630]  targeted to like, oh you're not gonna
[52:53.630 --> 52:55.570]  bloat or like, oh this is
[52:55.570 --> 52:57.630]  gonna make your hair grow? I've never noticed anything
[52:57.630 --> 52:59.550]  with anyone I've ever tried.
[53:00.610 --> 53:01.610]  And I stuck with them for
[53:01.610 --> 53:03.570]  a while and it never did anything
[53:03.570 --> 53:05.430]  for me. I don't want to make any,
[53:05.550 --> 53:07.510]  you know, I could be wrong about this. I feel like
[53:07.510 --> 53:09.430]  we're in different realms though. Like I'm
[53:09.430 --> 53:11.950]  talking about vitamin C and you're
[53:11.950 --> 53:13.870]  talking about hair growth pills and I don't feel like
[53:13.870 --> 53:14.990]  they're quite the same.
[53:15.670 --> 53:17.310]  I've also tried like a multivitamin.
[53:18.090 --> 53:19.490]  With vitamin C in it.
[53:19.770 --> 53:21.010]  But how would you know whether it worked?
[53:21.510 --> 53:24.090]  I mean, I didn't feel any different so I'm assuming it didn't do anything.
[53:24.630 --> 53:25.970]  Yeah, but I don't think you're supposed
[53:25.970 --> 53:26.510]  to...
[53:28.110 --> 53:29.750]  According to Harvard
[53:31.010 --> 53:31.410]  University,
[53:31.870 --> 53:33.870]  if you take a multivitamin, it's probably because
[53:33.870 --> 53:35.830]  you want to do everything you can to protect your health, but there is
[53:35.830 --> 53:37.690]  still limited evidence that a daily cocktail
[53:37.690 --> 53:40.010]  of essential vitamins and minerals actually
[53:40.010 --> 53:41.910]  delivers what you expect. Most studies
[53:41.910 --> 53:44.010]  find no benefit from multivitamins
[53:44.010 --> 53:45.830]  in protecting brain or heart.
[53:46.370 --> 53:48.010]  Well, I'm just... I'm straight up
[53:48.010 --> 53:49.970]  vitamin C. What about singular vitamins?
[53:50.410 --> 53:52.050]  But what are you... Okay, so you're saying
[53:52.050 --> 53:54.390]  vitamin C. What are you trying to do with vitamin C?
[53:54.730 --> 53:56.070]  I don't really know, to
[53:56.070 --> 53:58.130]  be honest. I got it when I... Okay, so you're just
[53:58.130 --> 53:59.610]  picking one and going for it?
[53:59.810 --> 54:02.070]  Well, it was when I first started
[54:02.070 --> 54:03.330]  to get like my cold.
[54:03.890 --> 54:06.070]  I got a big bottle of vitamin, chewable
[54:06.070 --> 54:08.170]  vitamin C and I'm taking
[54:08.170 --> 54:09.910]  them, but I don't...
[54:09.910 --> 54:12.330]  I just... I feel... I don't know. I feel like I've heard...
[54:12.330 --> 54:14.010]  It's sort of like diet soda for me.
[54:14.170 --> 54:15.710]  I feel like I've heard it's better.
[54:15.970 --> 54:18.170]  I feel like I've heard it's worse. I feel like
[54:18.170 --> 54:20.110]  it flip-flops. I just... I don't know.
[54:20.230 --> 54:22.190]  I was hoping somebody here would have
[54:22.190 --> 54:24.230]  a more informed opinion on the effect
[54:24.230 --> 54:26.070]  Yeah, I mean, vitamin C doesn't...
[54:26.070 --> 54:28.050]  It's not gonna like cure the cold. It's vitamin
[54:28.050 --> 54:30.030]  C is just... No, but like it'll help...
[54:30.030 --> 54:32.130]  Is there... Is there a value
[54:32.130 --> 54:34.170]  beyond if I like the taste of
[54:34.170 --> 54:35.390]  this in consuming it?
[54:35.390 --> 54:37.130]  Well, yeah, it depends on what you're taking.
[54:37.270 --> 54:38.550]  Like, I take potassium
[54:39.810 --> 54:41.410]  like often. Like, I'll eat
[54:41.410 --> 54:43.510]  a banana every day, whatever. I get a lot
[54:43.510 --> 54:45.370]  of like cramps, like leg cramps, foot cramps.
[54:45.530 --> 54:47.330]  And when I'm cramping and I take
[54:48.090 --> 54:49.430]  potassium, vitamin K,
[54:49.670 --> 54:51.710]  that helps me almost immediately.
[54:52.070 --> 54:52.610]  So, yes.
[54:53.710 --> 54:55.410]  Now, is that whether you take
[54:55.410 --> 54:57.390]  a pill or eat the banana? Because I would imagine
[54:57.390 --> 54:58.730]  eating the banana gets you
[54:59.210 --> 55:01.090]  a better form of potassium.
[55:01.570 --> 55:05.370]  It is... It's either way. It is like...
[55:06.250 --> 55:06.610]  No.
[55:07.310 --> 55:09.250]  No, because the way that I'm feeling
[55:09.250 --> 55:11.370]  and the way that it works for
[55:11.370 --> 55:12.910]  me is, boy, it works.
[55:13.330 --> 55:15.150]  Because when I don't, and you just try to go like,
[55:15.230 --> 55:17.470]  I don't need it this time. And then you go, I'm in hell, I'm in hell,
[55:17.510 --> 55:19.470]  I'm in hell. Hey, I totally get
[55:19.470 --> 55:21.370]  that. I feel the same way about Miralax.
[55:22.050 --> 55:22.590]  Oh, yeah.
[55:24.410 --> 55:25.330]  But I don't think
[55:25.330 --> 55:27.150]  vitamin C does anything for like the cold.
[55:27.830 --> 55:29.310]  No, I just wondered if like
[55:29.310 --> 55:30.950]  am I improving my
[55:31.370 --> 55:32.670]  body in any way? Maybe.
[55:33.570 --> 55:34.730]  It helps your body
[55:34.730 --> 55:35.690]  make collagen,
[55:37.910 --> 55:38.970]  which, you know,
[55:39.110 --> 55:40.530]  helps you grow skin
[55:40.530 --> 55:42.370]  and cartilage and tendons and stuff.
[55:43.150 --> 55:44.510]  I could use some tendons.
[55:45.130 --> 55:46.650]  Yeah. I like that idea.
[55:46.970 --> 55:47.750]  I could use some more tendon.
[55:48.370 --> 55:50.710]  I just don't know that the idea of the multivitamin
[55:50.710 --> 55:52.590]  has been proven to work, but like if you
[55:52.590 --> 55:54.710]  ate a bunch of oranges, you're gonna get a benefit
[55:54.710 --> 55:56.270]  from the vitamin C that you eat that way.
[55:57.010 --> 55:58.790]  Because I feel like vitamin water doesn't work
[55:58.790 --> 56:00.750]  either, right? That's also like it filters
[56:00.750 --> 56:02.830]  out all the vitamins. I feel like that does nothing.
[56:02.970 --> 56:04.030]  I don't know. Absolutely.
[56:05.090 --> 56:06.510]  Gavin, did you figure out your word yet or what?
[56:07.210 --> 56:08.750]  I'm looking through a...
[56:11.670 --> 56:12.030]  um...
[56:12.030 --> 56:12.370]  God,
[56:12.590 --> 56:14.730]  while you guys were... Andrew or somebody was doing like
[56:14.730 --> 56:16.750]  a heartfelt talking about the end of the show or something
[56:16.750 --> 56:18.730]  and I completely zoned out to try to find that stupid
[56:18.730 --> 56:20.230]  word and I didn't get anywhere. That's fine.
[56:22.350 --> 56:22.870]  We should
[56:22.870 --> 56:24.790]  probably say where people could
[56:24.790 --> 56:26.830]  go to find information about the next
[56:26.830 --> 56:28.750]  thing we'll do, which I would say is all
[56:28.750 --> 56:30.550]  of our personal socials. Yeah,
[56:30.650 --> 56:32.570]  I would say that our personal social media
[56:33.510 --> 56:34.570]  uh... for me, that's
[56:34.570 --> 56:36.110]  at Eric Bedour
[56:36.730 --> 56:38.770]  on all social media. That'll be a place
[56:38.770 --> 56:40.330]  where you can stay updated
[56:41.470 --> 56:42.690]  um... on what we're doing
[56:42.690 --> 56:44.570]  next. If you guys want to call out your personal
[56:44.570 --> 56:46.410]  socials where people can find more information.
[56:46.910 --> 56:48.670]  Uh, yeah. I'm on Instagram at
[56:48.670 --> 56:50.370]  at Jeff L. Ramsey and TikTok
[56:50.370 --> 56:52.810]  at Jeff's Daily Rip. I'll communicate both
[56:52.810 --> 56:54.890]  uh... through both of those. Here's the thing
[56:54.890 --> 56:56.810]  though. Next week
[56:57.270 --> 56:58.170]  on a Wednesday
[56:58.930 --> 57:00.950]  when F*** Face is supposed to come out
[57:00.950 --> 57:02.950]  and you're like, ah, fuck, where's
[57:02.950 --> 57:03.930]  F*** Face? It's over.
[57:04.910 --> 57:06.890]  It's not. It's coming out. It's
[57:06.890 --> 57:09.170]  a new thing. Just look. Go to our socials
[57:09.170 --> 57:10.870]  and we'll tell you where it is and there will be
[57:10.870 --> 57:12.990]  a new thing and you'll go, oh, fuck, we didn't
[57:12.990 --> 57:14.810]  skip a beat. It's just like it never
[57:15.210 --> 57:16.970]  nothing ever stopped.
[57:17.490 --> 57:18.350]  There will be
[57:18.350 --> 57:20.610]  a regulation episode out
[57:21.050 --> 57:22.850]  just like you normally would
[57:22.850 --> 57:24.670]  have every Wednesday. Yes.
[57:24.670 --> 57:26.630]  And every Wednesday going forward until
[57:26.630 --> 57:28.270]  we can't make this any longer.
[57:28.850 --> 57:30.710]  I'm so excited to build that thing
[57:30.710 --> 57:32.670]  with all of you and our amazing
[57:32.670 --> 57:34.650]  community. Does anyone else want to
[57:34.650 --> 57:36.730]  say their social medias so that way people know?
[57:36.870 --> 57:38.750]  I'm at Andrew Pinton and uh
[57:38.750 --> 57:40.910]  I'm not at Rooster Teeth
[57:40.910 --> 57:42.050]  so don't go there.
[57:42.490 --> 57:44.530]  Because I will not be posting there
[57:44.530 --> 57:45.130]  any updates.
[57:46.970 --> 57:48.090]  Gavin Free.
[57:50.410 --> 57:52.270]  Wasn't a joke, Nick. That's my name.
[57:52.270 --> 57:54.050]  That's the way you said it.
[57:54.850 --> 57:56.230]  I can't think of a more
[57:56.230 --> 57:58.190]  poignant way than to
[57:58.190 --> 57:59.890]  wrap up the last two hundred and
[58:00.950 --> 58:02.390]  six, five episodes
[58:03.590 --> 58:04.070]  than
[58:04.070 --> 58:06.170]  all disinterestedly sharing
[58:06.170 --> 58:07.170]  our socials.
[58:09.740 --> 58:11.140]  Wait, wait, Gavin, say
[58:11.140 --> 58:13.580]  your name again, one second. It's Gavin Free.
[58:15.060 --> 58:15.880]  Now it's
[58:15.880 --> 58:17.520]  Chunk. So is this
[58:17.520 --> 58:19.580]  the last episode that Eric will want
[58:19.580 --> 58:20.140]  us to end?
[58:21.140 --> 58:21.540]  No.
[58:21.640 --> 58:23.880]  Or will you keep up that shtick next time?
[58:24.100 --> 58:25.940]  Shtick? You think it's shtick? He's still the producer.
[58:26.200 --> 58:27.900]  He's still producing. Yeah, I need it to end.
[58:28.040 --> 58:30.240]  I have other things to do. There's a bunch
[58:30.240 --> 58:31.840]  of other shtick. I'm getting...
[58:31.840 --> 58:33.500]  What other things are you going to have to do?
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.960]  I have people messaging me right now that are
[58:35.960 --> 58:37.980]  working for this current company saying, hey, I need you to
[58:37.980 --> 58:40.100]  call me ASAP. Oh. Right, but
[58:40.100 --> 58:41.880]  what would...
[58:41.880 --> 58:43.120]  You won't have that next time.
[58:43.720 --> 58:46.140]  No, but I'll be working with different companies
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.060]  and different people to
[58:48.060 --> 58:49.540]  try to get us different opportunities
[58:50.060 --> 58:52.060]  and more things so that way we can continue
[58:52.060 --> 58:54.080]  to do this. The growth doesn't end.
[58:54.340 --> 58:55.660]  As much as you all want to
[58:56.900 --> 58:58.080]  disinterestingly give your social
[58:58.080 --> 58:59.500]  media so we can sort of
[59:00.060 --> 59:01.960]  market this, which is something we failed
[59:01.960 --> 59:03.740]  to do for the last two years,
[59:04.540 --> 59:05.800]  it's something that needs to happen.
[59:06.000 --> 59:07.680]  We've never had marketing for this show.
[59:07.940 --> 59:08.660]  I agree.
[59:09.920 --> 59:11.860]  Can't even get in a fuckin' variety article!
[59:14.500 --> 59:15.980]  Is that what we should announce on
[59:15.980 --> 59:17.440]  a new name? Yeah.
[59:17.780 --> 59:20.000]  Find us in Variety. Variety's nuts.
[59:20.320 --> 59:20.960]  Fuck, dude.
[59:21.820 --> 59:23.580]  That really did piss me off.
[59:26.000 --> 59:27.840]  The most successful fuckin' thing
[59:27.840 --> 59:30.020]  the company had going for it, it got
[59:30.020 --> 59:32.000]  omitted. Oh my God. Story of my
[59:32.660 --> 59:33.540]  fuckin' life!
[59:34.820 --> 59:36.080]  Clamoring for a little
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.880]  bit of respect for all the fuckin'
[59:37.960 --> 59:40.020]  hard work we're doing. I heard
[59:40.020 --> 59:41.960]  rumors that if this doesn't
[59:41.960 --> 59:44.220]  go well, Geoff's gonna have to go back to Machinima, so please
[59:44.220 --> 59:45.860]  Oh God, no!
[59:47.460 --> 59:48.220]  Don't make me
[59:48.220 --> 59:48.860]  bob heads.
[59:50.920 --> 59:52.200]  I spent the last 15
[59:52.200 --> 59:54.180]  minutes trying to find a fake word.
[59:54.560 --> 59:56.220]  I could easily just make up a new...
[59:57.140 --> 59:58.220]  I was gonna say
[59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.340]  something, but you gotta give him enough
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:01.420]  rope to hang him, you know what I mean?
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.240]  It was Clemens.
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.200]  Oh, that might've been it.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.280]  That's not right. I liked the old
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.660]  one better. Oh, Grungle?
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:12.460]  That actually
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:14.520]  sounded closer to the old one.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.380]  That episode was a real zazzle.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.180]  Do you guys want to take us out? Hell yeah!
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.360]  Yeah, let's do it. Did everyone say
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.320]  that heartfelt thing? Go for it, Gavin.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.520]  I already did mine, you were ignoring it.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:26.580]  Oh, I was trying to find your stupid word!
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.040]  So was I, you fool!
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.360]  What? Eric, I think like Warner,
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.380]  you should take this thing out back and just put a
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.040]  bullet in it. Dude, Nelson's done.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.460]  Oh! Do we have a bullet sound?
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.320]  Should we just end on a gunshot?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.440]  Uh... No, let's end
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.640]  on silence.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:44.740]  What was that? Someone's mouth?
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:45.560]  Yeah, that was me.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.020]  It's the closest I got.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:49.980]  We should take
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.980]  real firing squad
[01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.380]  execution videos
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.820]  and put that sound over them.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:56.600]  No, we shouldn't.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.760]  It's such a tasteful idea.
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.600]  Alright, well,
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.620]  find us next week
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.200]  for a new episode.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.520]  Very excited
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.960]  to continue this with you guys.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.160]  Very excited for the
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.240]  fans who want to support us, that can
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:19.780]  support us directly and
[01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.280]  help us grow and make
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.220]  the show the way that we want
[01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.160]  to make it so that way you're getting
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:27.280]  the best version of it.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.380]  I think that'll do it.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.180]  I just processed Gavin wanted to
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.720]  end this episode with an execution
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.060]  firing squad and then it would go
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:37.980]  into me crying about how much the community
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.840]  has meant to us.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.040]  I mean, that feels pretty
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:42.780]  par for the course.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.120]  Goddamn. I do want to say, though,
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.680]  before we do
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:49.920]  transition into Andrew crying
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.960]  again, I do
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.800]  want to say that I do think, you know,
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.700]  we've joked around about it, we've
[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.900]  hemmed and hawed, but the
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.000]  future of what we're doing, I think, is
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.760]  very bright. And I want you,
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.120]  the audience, to know that we are
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.320]  all very excited
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.580]  about it. We're very invested
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:10.300]  in it. I am excited. I've spent
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.440]  21 years building shit like
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.260]  this, and I'm so fucking
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:16.340]  excited to be able to start over again
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.400]  and build it with the small
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.040]  dedicated core of
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.040]  incredibly stupid people
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.400]  that is gonna take
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.320]  this thing going forward. And
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.300]  I just want...
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.500]  I hope we've done a good job, and I know we haven't
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.340]  because we don't do a good job of much, but of
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.300]  conveying to y'all that not only
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:36.240]  is this not slowing down or
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.240]  stopping, it's gonna speed up, and
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.260]  we're gonna be bigger and better. It's
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.260]  gonna take some time, and a lot of it is gonna
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.040]  depend on you because we are now
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.160]  in your hands. And that's okay. We're
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.320]  very comfortable. I think we've
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.420]  built a great relationship between the audience
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:52.080]  and the regulation crew,
[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.180]  and I'm very excited to go
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.640]  forward with you guys
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.420]  on this new thing. And I really
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.980]  really really hope you'll tune in,
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:02.240]  and more so, I hope you'll tell
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.760]  people about it. Because
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.340]  we're entering into uncharted
[01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.180]  territory. There's no safety net
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.500]  going forward, and we really
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:11.000]  need to
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.240]  fucking nail it. And so it's gonna take your help.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.220]  But if you support us,
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:18.240]  we're gonna do our goddamnedest to make you
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:20.200]  laugh along the way. Sorry about
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:20.800]  my vagina.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.180]  I'm not. It's fucking... I'd
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.080]  beat off twice already.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:27.940]  Back.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.120]  We're ending in the cum era. Fantastic.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.780]  No!
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.780]  Remember that wrestling let's play?
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:40.200]  Alright, take it
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.240]  away, Andrew!
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.720]  See you next week!
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:52.380]  Hey, it's Andrew.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:53.760]  I'm recording.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.100]  This is a bonus... I don't know
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.080]  if bonus is the right word. That makes it sound more
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.460]  fun than it is. I just wanted to record
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.300]  since this is the last episode
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.360]  of F*** Face.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.100]  A little message
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:08.060]  more aimed towards the audience
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.200]  and there's a good chance
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.080]  I'll cry, so I didn't want to record this
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.740]  in a group setting.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.040]  I'm not that
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.060]  emotionally vulnerable. I try to be open
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.520]  and all that, but that
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.120]  is a little too much for me today.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.480]  So I
[01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.620]  wrote some stuff down.
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.960]  I hope that
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.800]  me reading it and that I'm not just speaking from the top
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.740]  of my head doesn't minimize
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.760]  how genuine these words
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.600]  are and how much it means to me.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500]  As you may have heard,
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.140]  the company is closing.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.800]  Shocking, I know, but it's true.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:45.780]  And when I reflect
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.300]  on the past four years,
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:49.500]  it's impossible
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:50.920]  to
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:53.780]  succinctly describe
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.900]  what they've meant to me.
[01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:57.420]  One of the most rewarding parts
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.820]  of what we do,
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:02.020]  in my eyes at least, is getting to be part
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.620]  of this incredible community
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.780]  that we are so lucky to have
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.360]  had formed
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.060]  around us. Sorry.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.260]  Oh man.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.540]  I keep my DMs open
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.620]  and the amount of messages I've received
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.480]  over the years, filled with kindness
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.840]  and support, has been overwhelming
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:20.980]  in the best way.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.060]  I try my best to reply to
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.660]  all of them, but
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:27.180]  if you're listening and I missed
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.540]  you, know I'm genuinely sorry.
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.980]  The reason I bring this up is
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.120]  the most common thread in those messages
[01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.120]  is a thanks for making
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.960]  this and how it has helped
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.880]  endure a time of
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.960]  darkness. What's important to me
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.980]  in this moment is that you know
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.020]  how aligned my feelings are, but towards you.
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.080]  To everyone who is listening
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.040]  right now, I say with all of the weight in the
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.100]  world, thank you for allowing this
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.740]  ridiculous show to exist.
[01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:55.240]  It has changed my life forever
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.160]  and I will feel indebted to you
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.720]  for the rest of my life.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.140]  Like most people,
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:02.720]  these past few years have been hard
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.880]  and at times I felt as though I was
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.900]  drowning, but knowing that
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.940]  no matter what was happening, I was going to get
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.800]  to spend time every week
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.920]  trying to make my friends laugh was
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.000]  a constant light. I don't
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.100]  know how I navigated these years
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:19.080]  sorry, I fucked that up
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.360]  because my throat is sore,
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:23.100]  my eyes are watery, I'm trying
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.080]  to read, I'm a mess, but
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.180]  I don't know how I would have
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:28.800]  navigated these years without the show.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.040]  The space we have created is
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.140]  impossible without you, so as much as it is
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.840]  ours, it is yours.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.220]  Although the company is
[01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.180]  in fact dying, that space
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.160]  will continue on and I'm so
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.000]  excited to continue to build it all with you.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.160]  Thank you so much for all the years
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.220]  of support. I'm so excited for
[01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.000]  us to start our next thing, which is
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.240]  going to be immediately following this
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.120]  like it's going to be no time has passed at all
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.500]  it'll be on a different feed
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.360]  um, but
[01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.700]  yeah, we
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.100]  we appreciate your support so much
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.080]  it has been a
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.400]  truly amazing four years
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.420]  and hopefully many more to come
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.520]  um, thank you
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.340]  and
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.860]  have a wonderful rest of your day
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.320]  Hey guys, MajorLeagueFan
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.840]  Jack here with a look at next week's
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.320]  episode of F*** Face
[01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:25.550]  And once again
[01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.150]  Andrew never ate the pencil
[01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.510]  All that and more was on this series
[01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:30.390]  called F*** Face
