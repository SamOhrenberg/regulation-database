[00:00.000 --> 00:04.620]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[00:05.120 --> 00:11.500]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated, and it just feels so good.
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.180]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[00:18.740 --> 00:23.920]  suddenly it seems quite practical. The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[00:24.280 --> 00:29.420]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.
[00:39.830 --> 00:44.450]  Can I ask you a question, Andrew? I keep seeing this pop up, uh, and I figure,
[00:44.610 --> 00:47.170]  I mean it doesn't have to be on the show because it doesn't really matter or whatever.
[00:47.310 --> 00:47.530]  Sure.
[00:47.670 --> 00:50.290]  How do you read this? I don't understand.
[00:50.550 --> 00:56.170]  Uh, regular clean, plus clean, super clean.
[00:56.250 --> 01:02.570]  No, no, no. Shut up. Shut up. The price is $179.99? What is...
[01:02.570 --> 01:05.610]  Okay. $179.99?
[01:06.110 --> 01:08.710]  I don't understand. What does that mean?
[01:09.330 --> 01:10.310]  $179 what?
[01:12.110 --> 01:16.090]  I have no idea. $179...
[01:17.070 --> 01:24.310]  $179.99. $199.99. $209.99. What is that? How is it $212?
[01:24.730 --> 01:26.370]  Yeah, what currency is that in?
[01:26.610 --> 01:30.910]  That's what I'm asking. How is it $209 what? $209 what?
[01:31.210 --> 01:34.210]  Canadian dollars for one gallon of gas? Is it that expensive?
[01:35.390 --> 01:35.870]  Oh.
[01:37.230 --> 01:38.110]  Do you not...
[01:38.110 --> 01:38.550]  I've...
[01:38.550 --> 01:38.770]  What?
[01:39.570 --> 01:41.350]  I've never thought about this.
[01:41.710 --> 01:43.970]  What do you mean? What do you mean?
[01:44.230 --> 01:46.730]  Well, I don't... I don't drive. I'm not a... I don't have a car.
[01:46.830 --> 01:48.390]  Well, I own a car, but I don't drive it.
[01:48.390 --> 01:51.870]  But like... But like, look. Okay, here, here, here, here. Four...
[01:51.870 --> 01:53.570]  I think cents. I think it's in cents.
[01:54.230 --> 01:57.590]  Oh. Because look, as an example, I put the American...
[01:57.590 --> 01:59.070]  Here's just an example of American one.
[01:59.510 --> 02:03.890]  That, you would easily read as $4.84.
[02:03.890 --> 02:11.730]  So $1.799 would be $1.79.9 if it was cents. It says cents per liter.
[02:12.530 --> 02:13.330]  Oh. Oh.
[02:13.590 --> 02:14.610]  What? What?
[02:15.350 --> 02:16.410]  That makes sense.
[02:16.530 --> 02:17.390]  What the fuck? That's crazy.
[02:17.650 --> 02:21.530]  A gallon of pennies. Yeah. I never thought about what the currency is.
[02:22.030 --> 02:22.870]  You're right. That is odd.
[02:24.430 --> 02:31.790]  It's 100... Okay, so I'm going to go and say my gas is 199 pennies per liter.
[02:31.790 --> 02:34.790]  If you're bragging about affording 89...
[02:34.790 --> 02:38.130]  Okay, well, do you want to... We got rid of the penny years ago,
[02:38.270 --> 02:41.810]  so it's even... It's kind of crazy that we're still using that for gas.
[02:42.430 --> 02:45.690]  Hello, and welcome to another episode of the F*** Face Podcast.
[02:46.030 --> 02:47.010]  Oh, no. What?
[02:47.550 --> 02:49.970]  You said a prepubescent. You sounded like a prepubescent boy there.
[02:49.970 --> 02:54.170]  Oh, I'm still recovering from my cold I had a week ago.
[02:54.410 --> 02:55.450]  Oh, you got sick too?
[02:55.490 --> 02:58.290]  Remember, we were talking about it earlier. Yeah, I was sick for one day,
[02:58.370 --> 03:00.230]  but I have not had a cough for like three weeks.
[03:00.710 --> 03:01.010]  Sweet.
[03:01.010 --> 03:03.450]  Andrew complaining about how someone sounds?
[03:04.270 --> 03:08.950]  No, no, it wasn't complaining. That was I was making fun of two different things.
[03:09.070 --> 03:17.150]  This is episode 204. My name is Jeff Ramsey. I'm the offended with me,
[03:17.250 --> 03:21.590]  as always, Gavin Free and the offender, Andrew Panton, who's making fun of me.
[03:22.010 --> 03:24.070]  I was just in that moment.
[03:25.290 --> 03:28.330]  It's factually correct. I'm not going to run from it.
[03:28.450 --> 03:29.310]  How do you still sound like this?
[03:29.310 --> 03:30.570]  Well, this is what happened.
[03:30.570 --> 03:31.790]  It's been like this.
[03:32.130 --> 03:35.970]  So I was starting to get better and then not to be too vulgar.
[03:36.530 --> 03:38.850]  I keep when I'm on the edge of getting better,
[03:38.910 --> 03:43.390]  accidentally triggering my gag reflex and then coughing up like a bunch of acid.
[03:43.950 --> 03:47.370]  Like and it hurts the throat. So then I reset.
[03:48.130 --> 03:49.110]  This happened twice.
[03:49.390 --> 03:50.050]  How strong is your acid?
[03:50.530 --> 03:53.330]  Oh, listen, I'm an acid boy. Okay, I got it.
[03:53.810 --> 03:54.610]  I'm a machine.
[03:55.110 --> 03:55.590]  Aliens.
[03:56.830 --> 03:59.070]  I'm not there, but I'm close.
[03:59.530 --> 04:03.150]  Do you think if you if you chundered a little bit, if you boked on your floor,
[04:03.250 --> 04:04.490]  do you think it would go to the floor below?
[04:04.710 --> 04:06.030]  I don't know. I'm not there yet.
[04:06.050 --> 04:10.630]  I'm like, if I did like one of those 23 of me or whatever DNA,
[04:10.730 --> 04:12.770]  I'm probably like 3% xenomorph.
[04:13.470 --> 04:16.470]  I'm not enough where it's like the floor is melting, but.
[04:16.770 --> 04:19.590]  Well, they'd never be able to tell because it would melt through the vial.
[04:19.790 --> 04:22.310]  H.R. Giger has never drawn a picture of you.
[04:22.490 --> 04:23.930]  You're not that alien yet. Yeah.
[04:25.890 --> 04:30.390]  Yeah, I was maybe, though, on the street when he had the inspiration for it.
[04:30.450 --> 04:35.090]  I was part of not me specifically, but shades of me.
[04:35.290 --> 04:36.990]  I bet you wouldn't eat through the floor,
[04:37.070 --> 04:40.130]  but I bet it might take a little varnish off off off a wooden floor, maybe.
[04:40.390 --> 04:42.330]  Probably. Yeah, I think that's a good call.
[04:43.190 --> 04:44.870]  I guess used to melt through his laptops.
[04:45.390 --> 04:49.210]  Dude, Gus has the most acidic skin on Earth.
[04:49.310 --> 04:50.350]  It's so fucking weird.
[04:50.610 --> 04:52.090]  He would rub the metal.
[04:52.090 --> 04:54.490]  It would like rub the metal off of his laptops.
[04:54.670 --> 04:57.030]  Look at any any MacBook that dude's ever owned.
[04:58.730 --> 04:59.830]  That sounds dangerous.
[05:00.470 --> 05:02.010]  Yeah, eventually. That's why I used to get new laptops.
[05:02.370 --> 05:05.650]  I don't think he could professionally arm wrestle even if he wanted to.
[05:05.790 --> 05:06.690]  I'd just take a toll.
[05:06.870 --> 05:07.730]  You think he'd be disqualified?
[05:07.930 --> 05:09.370]  I think so. I think it'd be illegal.
[05:10.610 --> 05:15.230]  His acidic levels slowly melt through the skin.
[05:15.730 --> 05:16.290]  I got a clip.
[05:17.190 --> 05:17.670]  Oh, what?
[05:17.850 --> 05:20.190]  Oh, yeah, I'm coming in hot.
[05:20.190 --> 05:21.470]  Coming in hot with a clip.
[05:21.670 --> 05:24.150]  Just because, you know, it's been a it's been a part of the plot for a while.
[05:25.170 --> 05:25.970]  A recording.
[05:26.290 --> 05:27.430]  A plot for a while.
[05:27.630 --> 05:29.150]  From the Rooster Teeth podcast.
[05:29.690 --> 05:29.990]  Oh!
[05:33.210 --> 05:34.010]  Episode 39.
[05:36.230 --> 05:36.950]  Here we go.
[05:37.550 --> 05:39.470]  But it's a two and a half hour long movie.
[05:39.590 --> 05:41.370]  You just described every Roland Emmerich movie.
[05:41.410 --> 05:42.650]  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.
[05:42.890 --> 05:45.090]  I mean, like, you know, the animators had a field day with that.
[05:45.170 --> 05:49.430]  Like, OK, we needed to blow up Las Vegas by, you know, an earthquake and sandstorm.
[05:49.430 --> 05:51.190]  OK, spoiler alert.
[05:52.150 --> 05:53.310]  It's in the trailer.
[05:53.530 --> 05:53.810]  Come on.
[05:53.930 --> 05:55.350]  No, I'm ruined.
[05:55.590 --> 05:59.810]  It's like we like it's that whole movie is thank God we weren't standing where we were
[05:59.810 --> 06:00.890]  10 seconds ago.
[06:01.050 --> 06:02.930]  Like, that's the whole movie.
[06:03.150 --> 06:05.330]  Like, 10 seconds.
[06:05.650 --> 06:06.830]  That's a different joke.
[06:07.010 --> 06:07.310]  Totally.
[06:07.610 --> 06:08.310]  Oh, my God.
[06:08.830 --> 06:09.750]  How's that different joke?
[06:09.790 --> 06:11.490]  Let me let me post your joke.
[06:12.550 --> 06:16.810]  OK, listen, I'm I'm not necessarily a fan of jumping.
[06:16.910 --> 06:17.810]  Jack's defendant here.
[06:17.870 --> 06:18.730]  Bullet of Jack.
[06:19.770 --> 06:22.170]  He's the offender and Jack's defendant.
[06:22.690 --> 06:23.690]  It's a different type.
[06:23.950 --> 06:26.070]  Andrew Patton is the official offender defendant.
[06:26.610 --> 06:28.250]  Oh, no, that's the wrong.
[06:28.330 --> 06:28.750]  Sorry.
[06:28.970 --> 06:29.150]  Wrong.
[06:33.750 --> 06:34.950]  That's Alan Wake 2.
[06:35.110 --> 06:37.410]  It's the guy's dick in Alan Wake 2.
[06:37.410 --> 06:40.570]  Why did you hit the wrong button?
[06:42.390 --> 06:44.790]  That's the exact same fucking joke.
[06:45.030 --> 06:45.470]  Yeah, it was.
[06:45.570 --> 06:45.830]  Never mind.
[06:45.890 --> 06:46.250]  I was wrong.
[06:46.510 --> 06:47.290]  I was wrong about that.
[06:47.290 --> 06:48.970]  I remember the tweet.
[06:50.150 --> 06:51.010]  The tweet is.
[06:51.170 --> 06:51.990]  Well, Gavin, you can say it.
[06:52.050 --> 06:53.130]  It's your your fucking words.
[06:53.590 --> 06:55.430]  The tweet was 2012 should have been called.
[06:55.530 --> 06:58.110]  I'm glad I'm not 10 feet behind where I am right now.
[06:59.110 --> 07:00.110]  Man, I have.
[07:00.510 --> 07:06.890]  The funny thing is, though, there's also a clip from the Rooster Teeth podcast episode 63.
[07:08.590 --> 07:10.090]  About six months later.
[07:10.410 --> 07:10.970]  Check this out.
[07:11.590 --> 07:15.010]  Someone wrote that that movie is like, you know, thank God I wasn't standing there 10
[07:15.010 --> 07:15.690]  seconds ago.
[07:15.690 --> 07:20.010]  The movie is like everything like it's blown up or destroyed right behind them as they're
[07:20.010 --> 07:20.450]  like driving.
[07:20.690 --> 07:26.730]  I know someone wrote it became it became an original comment and then became someone wrote.
[07:26.950 --> 07:28.970]  I've also read that Jeff really likes that joke.
[07:29.050 --> 07:30.110]  He laughed both times.
[07:31.750 --> 07:32.910]  That makes sense.
[07:32.970 --> 07:33.790]  It was your joke.
[07:33.890 --> 07:34.550]  I like you.
[07:34.570 --> 07:35.390]  You're funny.
[07:35.770 --> 07:41.110]  I think you I mean, I think you are the most entertaining person I've ever met.
[07:41.210 --> 07:43.750]  That's why that's why I work with you.
[07:43.750 --> 07:49.070]  So it stands to reason that Jack like poorly ripping you off would still be amusing to
[07:49.070 --> 07:50.290]  me because it's still your comedy.
[07:50.790 --> 07:53.290]  Oh, that's that's a nice level of consistence.
[07:53.750 --> 08:03.630]  To be clear, Gavin's tweet is the 18th of November of 2009 and episode 39 of the Rooster
[08:03.630 --> 08:06.690]  Teeth podcast is December 9th, 2009.
[08:07.250 --> 08:10.710]  I mean, just mere weeks, mere weeks.
[08:10.710 --> 08:16.450]  After I mentioned it, Jack text me saying, I don't think I stole your 2012 joke, question
[08:16.450 --> 08:19.810]  mark. But then afterwards he wrote, but that was 20 years ago.
[08:19.910 --> 08:24.190]  So maybe I'm completely off Jack's defense.
[08:24.490 --> 08:27.930]  I am stepping away from it entirely.
[08:28.430 --> 08:31.730]  Bold move by the defense to say that was a totally different joke.
[08:32.270 --> 08:35.690]  Yeah, well, to be fair, not a very original joke.
[08:35.790 --> 08:38.850]  I'm sure a bunch of people watched that movie and thought the exact same thing.
[08:38.950 --> 08:40.230]  I'm pretty sure you're the only one.
[08:40.710 --> 08:42.450]  I'm on your side now.
[08:43.110 --> 08:45.110]  Definitely yours and only yours.
[08:45.270 --> 08:48.630]  Does that ever happen in court where the defense walks over to the prosecution?
[08:48.870 --> 08:49.990]  They just sit next to each other.
[08:50.330 --> 08:52.090]  Listen, I'm a vibes guy.
[08:52.230 --> 08:55.350]  I've just been feeling the vibes of this courtroom and I've been swayed.
[08:55.490 --> 08:56.090]  I've moved through.
[08:56.510 --> 08:57.590]  Information has come out.
[08:58.350 --> 09:01.190]  I came in as a as a middle lawyer.
[09:02.110 --> 09:03.690]  And I got to say, it's on your side.
[09:03.810 --> 09:06.930]  This is the whole point of discovery, as they say.
[09:07.490 --> 09:07.930]  Yes.
[09:08.390 --> 09:12.050]  We can find out all the dirty secrets and truths and they can come to light.
[09:12.170 --> 09:15.650]  And then we can find out the reality of the situation, which is that Jack...
[09:17.030 --> 09:18.090]  What year was that again?
[09:18.830 --> 09:19.270]  2012?
[09:20.190 --> 09:20.630]  2009.
[09:21.270 --> 09:26.230]  That Jack in 2009 is exactly as annoying as Jack in 2024 and still a thief.
[09:29.150 --> 09:33.410]  I like that that closes out a 15 year storyline.
[09:33.650 --> 09:34.310]  It's not bad.
[09:34.570 --> 09:36.490]  It's like the old Halo overkill.
[09:36.490 --> 09:37.610]  How do you feel about it?
[09:37.690 --> 09:38.130]  How do I feel?
[09:38.430 --> 09:43.210]  Yeah, because you say it like this has been on everyone's collective mind for 15 years.
[09:43.650 --> 09:46.830]  This is a thing that you've been holding internally for that time.
[09:47.030 --> 09:49.350]  OK, I've been thinking about it for 15 years, but
[09:50.370 --> 09:52.950]  company like public plot wise, it's been about three weeks.
[09:54.890 --> 09:58.790]  But, you know, a good one to close out before the company ends entirely.
[09:58.930 --> 09:59.970]  Before the company closes out.
[10:00.050 --> 10:01.190]  Yeah. How does that?
[10:01.270 --> 10:03.150]  Do you feel like the biggest sense of completion?
[10:04.350 --> 10:05.110]  Um, no.
[10:05.110 --> 10:06.770]  Well, I mean, I think it's funny.
[10:06.950 --> 10:07.770]  It is funny.
[10:08.230 --> 10:09.650]  I don't care either way, really.
[10:10.270 --> 10:10.890]  There's a dumb tweet.
[10:11.450 --> 10:13.850]  I shouldn't say that Jack's a thief. I'm just making a joke.
[10:14.570 --> 10:16.270]  He kind of said he was.
[10:17.090 --> 10:21.410]  What do you think you are the first person to ever do in your life?
[10:22.450 --> 10:23.410]  Slip on a sushi container.
[10:24.830 --> 10:26.870]  I'm the first person.
[10:27.990 --> 10:33.890]  I'm the first person on Earth to sit in a swivel chair
[10:33.890 --> 10:38.690]  and drink a diet Pepsi with a watch on my right arm in this office.
[10:39.390 --> 10:40.630]  OK, decent.
[10:40.790 --> 10:44.010]  I guarantee you nobody else has done that in the history of this house.
[10:44.550 --> 10:45.310]  Anybody else?
[10:45.470 --> 10:50.430]  Well, I have one that I have a mystery that made me think of a mystery that I'm dealing with.
[10:50.910 --> 10:57.130]  I am the only person who has lived in the unit that I live in as the first person to move in.
[10:57.370 --> 11:00.970]  And I noticed yesterday on my bathroom wall,
[11:00.970 --> 11:06.090]  there are a bunch of scratch marks on the wall that I definitely didn't cause.
[11:06.210 --> 11:08.230]  Nobody I know would have been there caused.
[11:08.790 --> 11:10.070]  I don't know where they came from.
[11:10.730 --> 11:13.030]  I assume that I was the first to do everything in this space.
[11:13.250 --> 11:15.330]  I don't know why there are scratch marks on my wall.
[11:15.590 --> 11:17.050]  They're very clearly scratch marks.
[11:17.310 --> 11:18.030]  Do you think it was an animal?
[11:18.610 --> 11:18.990]  Maybe.
[11:19.210 --> 11:20.470]  But like, I don't know how.
[11:20.790 --> 11:27.690]  How would an animal have gotten up to my unit and then scratched in this specific place?
[11:28.050 --> 11:29.410]  Or like while it was being built, maybe?
[11:29.410 --> 11:32.530]  Yeah, I mean, do you think they've always been there?
[11:32.610 --> 11:33.650]  Like they're not new, right?
[11:33.810 --> 11:34.610]  Well, that's the thing.
[11:34.670 --> 11:39.490]  I don't know if I just never noticed or if they're new-ish.
[11:39.650 --> 11:41.450]  I don't know how they would be new-ish though if they were.
[11:41.890 --> 11:45.570]  So I'll, yeah, I think Gavin might be onto something.
[11:45.810 --> 11:52.130]  When one time during the pandemic, we stayed at a hotel downtown for like a staycation,
[11:52.550 --> 11:55.610]  kind of, you know, just to like sleep in a different bed and look at a different window.
[11:56.230 --> 11:58.670]  And it was at a place downtown that was kind of nice.
[11:58.670 --> 12:00.890]  We had like a little deck and we could sit out on the deck.
[12:01.050 --> 12:04.010]  And right across from where our hotel was, like on the other side of the street,
[12:04.610 --> 12:08.050]  they were building another high-rise condo kind of thing.
[12:08.430 --> 12:12.570]  And I want to say it was like, it was like built about two floors below where we were.
[12:12.750 --> 12:14.010]  So we were like on the 11th floor.
[12:14.130 --> 12:15.710]  This was like maybe the 9th or the 10th floor.
[12:16.190 --> 12:19.910]  And at night, as soon as the sun would go down and all the workers would leave,
[12:21.570 --> 12:25.010]  hundreds of raccoons would come from God knows where.
[12:25.010 --> 12:29.490]  And they would have the biggest raccoon party on the top of this,
[12:29.490 --> 12:32.790]  you know, in-process constructed building.
[12:32.950 --> 12:36.830]  And we spent a weekend just sitting on the deck,
[12:37.170 --> 12:40.330]  just laughing and watching raccoons play raccoon games,
[12:40.570 --> 12:44.470]  and rip shit up and go through the foot trash and eat,
[12:44.550 --> 12:47.490]  you know, like old fried chicken that somebody had thrown in a trash bag.
[12:47.630 --> 12:50.010]  And just like, and just wreak havoc.
[12:50.210 --> 12:52.190]  And then every, and then when they were done, they would leave.
[12:52.290 --> 12:54.090]  And then the next night they would come back out.
[12:54.090 --> 12:58.330]  I bet there was a fucking raccoon party in your apartment as it was being built.
[12:58.450 --> 13:00.030]  I love that. That's a narrative.
[13:00.130 --> 13:02.110]  I'm just going to go with that narrative, even if it isn't true.
[13:02.210 --> 13:03.670]  I like the idea of a raccoon party.
[13:03.910 --> 13:08.090]  I remember I was helping my friend move into a brand new house in England,
[13:08.470 --> 13:11.010]  and he was like giving me the tour and we're moving stuff in.
[13:11.270 --> 13:14.610]  And as a joke, he licked the toilet seat because he was like,
[13:14.670 --> 13:16.830]  ah, it's the only time I could do that. No one's used it yet.
[13:16.870 --> 13:20.770]  And I was like, the builders have probably shat in that thing a bunch.
[13:22.770 --> 13:24.070]  And, uh, he always threw up.
[13:24.450 --> 13:24.670]  Yeah.
[13:26.350 --> 13:29.030]  I was, uh, I was thinking about something similar,
[13:29.650 --> 13:33.990]  actually right around the time that, uh, we all lost our jobs, it would sidetrack.
[13:34.070 --> 13:34.330]  What?
[13:34.490 --> 13:38.750]  But I had begun initial, I had this thought and I had done some initial work
[13:38.750 --> 13:44.550]  around an episode of So Alright, where I got to thinking about how many people have touched your,
[13:44.990 --> 13:47.490]  something in your house, like how many people have touched your dining room table?
[13:47.490 --> 13:51.310]  Like physically human people have interacted with it.
[13:51.490 --> 13:55.110]  Like if you, or like your microwave, think about like every component that
[13:55.110 --> 13:59.470]  was built in the microwave that had, that was touched by a human being,
[13:59.650 --> 14:04.190]  the person who packed it up, the people who, uh, did the quality control checks,
[14:04.290 --> 14:10.950]  the people who, uh, loaded it onto a, uh, onto a truck and then the people who unloaded it
[14:10.950 --> 14:14.090]  and then put it on a shelf and then you bring it in your house and then you unpack it.
[14:14.090 --> 14:18.130]  By the time you open a brand new item that nobody's ever used before,
[14:18.470 --> 14:22.810]  hundreds and hundreds of humans have probably physically interacted with it.
[14:23.290 --> 14:28.070]  And my dining room table is one of those shitty, like made from reclaimed pallets
[14:28.070 --> 14:32.550]  tables. So it was a pallet before it was a table. So it's probably got even longer life.
[14:32.810 --> 14:35.130]  It had a whole other life. And then if you want to take it back to,
[14:35.270 --> 14:39.830]  like that pallet was a tree that a human cut and then milled, you know, and even if it's a
[14:39.830 --> 14:43.270]  human running a machine, he's still pushing buttons and manipulating what's happening
[14:43.270 --> 14:46.330]  and somebody's still taking it off the thing and loading it up as lumber.
[14:46.730 --> 14:51.450]  And then some, it's, or like my dining room table is an old, like Danish table I bought
[14:51.450 --> 14:56.570]  from a, like a used furniture store from the sixties, right? Like a Danish modern table.
[14:57.830 --> 15:00.410]  How many people have just eaten dinner at that fucking table?
[15:00.790 --> 15:04.110]  You know, imagine if before you died, you had to put everything back.
[15:10.230 --> 15:16.250]  Oh no, where's all this shit from technically?
[15:18.150 --> 15:22.050]  It kind of overwhelmed me for a couple of days though, where I just couldn't look at anything
[15:22.050 --> 15:25.390]  in my house and not think about how many hundreds of people had had their grubby hands all over.
[15:25.770 --> 15:29.410]  Like, I don't even want to think about how many people have touched my sofa before I ever did.
[15:29.410 --> 15:35.050]  Especially if you're thinking about the foam and the, the, the fucking, the fabric and the
[15:35.050 --> 15:38.390]  assemblage of the fabric, like every, it's mind boggling.
[15:38.890 --> 15:40.950]  How many people's balls do you think have been on it?
[15:41.650 --> 15:46.930]  Oh, tons. Everybody I know that's a dude has had their balls on it pretty much.
[15:47.190 --> 15:50.250]  You know, at least that I know that I spend any kind of time with.
[15:51.090 --> 15:56.170]  But I was thinking about it cause like 150 years ago or 120 years ago,
[15:56.730 --> 16:02.610]  you would like forge out into the West and then you'd build a house with your,
[16:03.250 --> 16:06.890]  by yourself or with another friend or with your wife or your kid.
[16:07.430 --> 16:09.490]  And then you'd, if you needed something in that house,
[16:09.550 --> 16:11.610]  you'd go cut down a tree and you'd fucking make it.
[16:11.710 --> 16:14.630]  And you could have a house that you were the only person that touched.
[16:15.150 --> 16:18.290]  Potentially, you know, like it'd get complicated if you bought like a piece,
[16:18.390 --> 16:21.850]  like something made out of iron that you got down from the local Smith or whatever.
[16:21.850 --> 16:23.030]  But for the most part,
[16:23.410 --> 16:26.630]  you would have been the only person to interact with all of your shit.
[16:26.790 --> 16:28.750]  And boy, are we in a different world than that now.
[16:29.190 --> 16:30.350]  Totally. That's crazy to think about.
[16:30.490 --> 16:33.210]  Do you ever drink a glass of water and think how these molecules,
[16:33.390 --> 16:34.950]  how many people have they been inside before?
[16:35.690 --> 16:38.590]  No, no, I never have, but I'm not going to drink water anymore.
[16:40.830 --> 16:44.030]  Eric said never WTF. You never thought that?
[16:44.150 --> 16:47.690]  No, I've never ever thought that ever.
[16:47.950 --> 16:50.290]  And now I am great. There's a finite amount of water on the planet.
[16:50.290 --> 16:54.890]  Yeah, no, I understand that. I just never thought about it being through a person.
[16:55.010 --> 16:58.210]  It just never occurred to me. Now it has. Thanks, man. Appreciate it.
[16:58.290 --> 17:05.150]  Anyway, when you're walking around your apartment or your home tonight,
[17:05.270 --> 17:08.450]  just pick one random item and pick it up and then think
[17:09.390 --> 17:13.590]  7000 people touched before I knew it existed and then wipe it, then wipe it down.
[17:14.370 --> 17:20.070]  Going back to the mystery conversation of or Gavin's resolution,
[17:20.170 --> 17:24.430]  do you guys have any Easter eggs or things related to this show that have never come out?
[17:24.770 --> 17:26.510]  You're still just sitting on.
[17:27.170 --> 17:31.270]  As we wind aside from notes that I don't understand. I don't think so.
[17:32.310 --> 17:37.970]  I I have stuff that was like in process that was that could still be in process.
[17:38.170 --> 17:40.550]  Like there's a few things here and there that I don't need to
[17:40.550 --> 17:43.570]  wrap up because I'll just carry them on to the next thing, if that makes sense.
[17:43.590 --> 17:47.450]  Oh, Gracie said grip strength. That'll that's carrying on.
[17:47.610 --> 17:49.830]  And it's going to that's not over.
[17:50.250 --> 17:53.530]  Don't I mean, just Jeff, don't even bother. Don't I mean, what's the point?
[17:53.630 --> 17:55.830]  It's fine. Just say, OK, and let's keep going.
[17:56.210 --> 17:58.710]  Is that the thing that we didn't pre measure?
[17:59.050 --> 18:01.310]  No, we didn't. We didn't have to say it.
[18:02.170 --> 18:03.150]  We pre measured.
[18:04.010 --> 18:06.250]  But you don't want to say the pre.
[18:06.430 --> 18:09.370]  I'm fine saying the pre now, if it's going to be late now,
[18:09.470 --> 18:13.490]  now that you've now that I'm doing it for fucking two months at this point.
[18:13.490 --> 18:14.970]  You have to just start over.
[18:15.130 --> 18:17.550]  I mean, get real, get real.
[18:17.890 --> 18:21.190]  Listen, I don't want to go down this road of anger and fighting.
[18:21.750 --> 18:25.270]  There's no I'm looking at that street and there's no way
[18:25.270 --> 18:27.130]  anyone comes out feeling good about themselves.
[18:27.290 --> 18:28.450]  So we're going to keep walking.
[18:28.570 --> 18:30.590]  I don't think it's true. I think I'm not involved.
[18:30.890 --> 18:33.010]  You're not involved. Decidedly not.
[18:34.450 --> 18:37.390]  But I have I had an Easter egg for the show.
[18:37.930 --> 18:39.170]  One of the bigger ones I've done.
[18:39.650 --> 18:40.350]  No one's found.
[18:40.350 --> 18:43.490]  I've been sitting on it for like nine months and I don't know how to.
[18:43.710 --> 18:46.230]  Oh, is that what you you were exing the other day?
[18:46.750 --> 18:48.750]  I was exing the other what?
[18:48.950 --> 18:50.650]  I saw I saw I saw a tweet on Twitter.
[18:50.650 --> 18:52.090]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[18:52.090 --> 18:53.870]  I saw a tweet from you that somebody had posted.
[18:54.630 --> 18:55.030]  Yeah.
[18:55.130 --> 18:59.150]  So is it like to the level of maybe one of us has monopoly money in our house
[18:59.150 --> 19:00.130]  and we don't know it sort of thing?
[19:00.690 --> 19:02.470]  I would say it's beyond that.
[19:03.390 --> 19:05.970]  I don't know how how much I should reveal.
[19:06.250 --> 19:07.930]  I confirmed it's still there.
[19:08.470 --> 19:13.950]  I gave all the instructions to find it in an episode within the past nine months.
[19:14.910 --> 19:16.290]  Is it like a scavenger?
[19:16.410 --> 19:18.270]  Like it's a it's out to the public to find.
[19:18.430 --> 19:21.850]  Well, that's I was hoping someone would just find it one day
[19:21.850 --> 19:27.010]  because I I prompted how to find it kind of subtly in a show
[19:27.690 --> 19:31.470]  that we did within the last nine months and has yet to be discovered.
[19:31.930 --> 19:33.210]  No traces of it.
[19:33.530 --> 19:35.310]  Within the last last nine months, you say?
[19:35.310 --> 19:38.510]  Within the last nine months to give a little bit of a range.
[19:39.330 --> 19:41.350]  Now, is this an Easter egg for us or for the audience?
[19:41.830 --> 19:44.110]  Uh, I mean, you guys don't know about it.
[19:44.410 --> 19:47.010]  I mean, it could be something that you could discover.
[19:47.310 --> 19:49.550]  Yeah, but you could fill a fucking ocean with what we don't know.
[19:49.710 --> 19:54.090]  I could tell you guys offline if you want or I can do I review.
[19:54.150 --> 19:54.850]  I don't know what to do.
[19:54.910 --> 19:59.330]  I know because this is wrapping up as does it end when the company ends?
[20:00.090 --> 20:02.090]  Uh, it will still exist and continue.
[20:02.090 --> 20:05.350]  It will just still be there to be found.
[20:05.590 --> 20:06.810]  And then we just we just wait.
[20:07.410 --> 20:07.810]  Okay.
[20:08.170 --> 20:09.550]  Should I give like a clue?
[20:10.650 --> 20:12.070]  I mean, it sounds like you just did.
[20:12.390 --> 20:13.390]  It's within the last I guess.
[20:13.410 --> 20:13.590]  Yeah.
[20:13.690 --> 20:14.450]  Within nine months.
[20:14.450 --> 20:15.570]  That means it was nine months ago.
[20:15.750 --> 20:16.730]  Within nine months.
[20:24.130 --> 20:29.570]  If that's what you want to believe, then you know that I can love you.
[20:32.190 --> 20:34.090]  I'm not going to confirm or deny that statement.
[20:38.710 --> 20:40.110]  You'll see when it's found.
[20:40.290 --> 20:43.530]  If it is found, people will confirm if that's right or not.
[20:43.550 --> 20:43.810]  Okay.
[20:44.670 --> 20:46.250]  I do love when people say shit like that.
[20:46.310 --> 20:48.790]  I was like, it was like, yeah, I was I waited for over 20 minutes.
[20:48.790 --> 20:51.410]  And it's like, so 21 minutes or 20 minutes in one second.
[20:55.340 --> 20:58.900]  We should also, um, we need to pass the torch.
[20:58.960 --> 21:02.020]  My watch has ended on a on the Nick mask.
[21:02.560 --> 21:03.280]  Who's taking?
[21:03.440 --> 21:04.300]  Who's taking Q2?
[21:05.360 --> 21:08.060]  I think I was Q2 if memory serves.
[21:08.320 --> 21:11.340]  And the last couple of episodes, did you have an ear out for it?
[21:12.140 --> 21:13.100]  Yeah, I've been listening.
[21:13.680 --> 21:16.880]  I've noticed that a lot of the audience seems to think that he's already worn it.
[21:17.360 --> 21:19.940]  But yes, I didn't pick up on it.
[21:20.120 --> 21:21.940]  Yeah, he's supposed to declare if he's worn it.
[21:22.140 --> 21:23.160]  So exactly.
[21:23.260 --> 21:24.940]  And we're all up to date on the rules.
[21:25.040 --> 21:26.080]  Always. We know that.
[21:26.360 --> 21:26.960]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:26.980 --> 21:31.520]  This is definitely a thing that we remember and we always take stock of.
[21:31.520 --> 21:36.520]  And that I know Gavin was diligently paying attention to for three straight months.
[21:36.720 --> 21:38.200]  Now I am clearly also laser focused.
[21:38.200 --> 21:43.680]  It means just as much to us as it does to you, the listener at home.
[21:43.940 --> 21:45.720]  A hundred percent. Absolutely.
[21:46.240 --> 21:52.360]  Now, does he have to do this in face or can it go over to the next thing?
[21:53.660 --> 21:54.540]  I think it has to.
[21:54.540 --> 21:55.220]  I think it's unfair.
[21:55.220 --> 21:57.000]  I think it can roll into the next thing.
[21:57.080 --> 21:58.500]  I think it rolls into the next thing.
[21:58.780 --> 21:59.400]  It's gonna roll.
[21:59.780 --> 22:00.000]  Yeah.
[22:01.720 --> 22:04.120]  He said that sounds like face jam, Nick.
[22:04.200 --> 22:04.600]  That was...
[22:08.460 --> 22:11.400]  Face jam Nick occurs a couple of octaves above normal.
[22:11.620 --> 22:11.880]  He does.
[22:12.000 --> 22:13.100]  You can ask Gracie.
[22:13.180 --> 22:17.240]  Gracie knows when Nick is in face jam mode, it's the...
[22:17.240 --> 22:18.760]  Oh, the pitch is like higher.
[22:19.160 --> 22:19.920]  It's very...
[22:19.920 --> 22:21.820]  But also we did face jam earlier today.
[22:21.980 --> 22:22.760]  So that might be...
[22:23.800 --> 22:25.000]  He's having trouble coming down.
[22:25.160 --> 22:26.860]  Is he in the mask right now?
[22:28.760 --> 22:30.300]  Wait, are you wasting a guess?
[22:30.300 --> 22:31.960]  No, no, you're not.
[22:32.100 --> 22:34.800]  Are you wasting a guess?
[22:34.920 --> 22:36.480]  First of all, I don't think...
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.000]  I think if we all fired our bullets, we would have more bullets than there are shows left
[22:41.000 --> 22:41.660]  this f***ing face.
[22:41.880 --> 22:42.620]  So I don't think...
[22:43.300 --> 22:44.500]  I think that'd be a problem for you.
[22:44.520 --> 22:47.460]  If I wouldn't fire the bullet in response to do you want to waste a guess?
[22:50.520 --> 22:52.740]  Do you want to be wrong today or next week?
[22:52.980 --> 22:54.020]  Today? Okay, cool.
[22:55.260 --> 22:56.840]  Does Eric have different modes?
[22:56.940 --> 22:59.140]  Does Gracie have different modes between the two shows?
[22:59.140 --> 23:00.980]  Oh, I think...
[23:00.980 --> 23:03.360]  I don't know if Gracie will admit that she does, but she does.
[23:03.400 --> 23:04.340]  No, I do. I do.
[23:04.600 --> 23:04.760]  Yeah.
[23:04.900 --> 23:07.220]  Are you more of a freak or less of a freak on this one?
[23:07.460 --> 23:07.560]  More.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.120]  Oh, less.
[23:10.200 --> 23:10.220]  Okay.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.360]  Here I'm way less.
[23:11.780 --> 23:12.960]  Even with that picture you took?
[23:13.820 --> 23:14.020]  Yeah.
[23:14.500 --> 23:17.020]  So how come you're half-assing it over here, Gracie?
[23:18.020 --> 23:21.000]  Sounds like you give it 110% over to those face jam f***ers.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.520]  It's a different beast over there.
[23:22.900 --> 23:25.740]  Yeah, she doesn't have to do any of the heavy lifting here.
[23:25.880 --> 23:28.320]  There's plenty between the three of you.
[23:28.320 --> 23:31.940]  It's a talent deficit on the other side.
[23:32.080 --> 23:32.420]  I get it.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.280]  It's a lot about when the food gets involved.
[23:34.500 --> 23:38.340]  Because I take charge in that realm and that's what really gets me out of my cage.
[23:38.600 --> 23:42.640]  The food gets her and Nick going in a way that is inhuman.
[23:43.080 --> 23:49.880]  Somebody described face jam as four fathers that have a daughter that they're not related to
[23:49.880 --> 23:51.660]  that sleeps in a human dog bed.
[23:52.120 --> 23:54.660]  And that really is the show.
[23:54.960 --> 23:56.940]  And we eat pizza.
[23:57.280 --> 23:58.080]  That's kind of it.
[23:58.320 --> 23:59.280]  That's just kind of it.
[23:59.980 --> 24:02.160]  Hey, speaking of eating stuff...
[24:05.180 --> 24:09.720]  Apparently, it has been brought to my attention over and over and over again
[24:09.720 --> 24:12.340]  in all forms of social media and email
[24:13.160 --> 24:18.680]  that the banana thing we invented or that I invented exists in many, many forms
[24:18.680 --> 24:20.140]  and has for a very long time.
[24:20.320 --> 24:21.900]  I had no idea.
[24:22.320 --> 24:24.560]  There's no point in trying to go further down that road
[24:24.560 --> 24:27.040]  because I can buy 20 different ones on Amazon.
[24:27.620 --> 24:30.520]  But you also don't have to let me know about it anymore.
[24:30.660 --> 24:31.920]  I got the message.
[24:32.180 --> 24:34.880]  I really, 100% got the message.
[24:34.980 --> 24:37.120]  We can still do our own version.
[24:37.400 --> 24:40.020]  Not versions of the product, but we can still fill our bananas
[24:40.420 --> 24:41.980]  and present them to each other with stuff.
[24:42.760 --> 24:43.240]  Yes, we can.
[24:43.300 --> 24:44.560]  And I think that's still a good idea.
[24:44.800 --> 24:46.940]  I just don't think we need to be in a rush to do it.
[24:47.080 --> 24:48.860]  Yeah, no, the market is already set.
[24:49.440 --> 24:50.140]  We can take our time.
[24:50.820 --> 24:52.400]  I'm not going to try to sell a product doing it,
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.680]  but we can definitely make our own versions and add it to the
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.280]  the rich pastiche of f***face culinary.
[25:00.200 --> 25:03.460]  Because I still want to see if a Tums powdered
[25:04.540 --> 25:07.480]  Pepto filled banana is suitable for Gracie.
[25:09.100 --> 25:09.540]  No.
[25:11.060 --> 25:11.780]  The answer is no.
[25:12.460 --> 25:13.240]  I think it will be.
[25:14.460 --> 25:15.920]  Well, there's only one way to find out.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.820]  What? So you're gonna do it?
[25:19.060 --> 25:20.320]  Yeah, it's an insane...
[25:23.520 --> 25:25.500]  Well, then if she keeps it down, it worked, right?
[25:26.360 --> 25:27.020]  But I don't.
[25:27.360 --> 25:27.520]  Yeah.
[25:27.840 --> 25:29.440]  Something tells me I'm not going to keep it down.
[25:30.980 --> 25:32.700]  I respect the willingness to try.
[25:33.660 --> 25:37.040]  Andrew and I almost filmed a new show this week, but then we didn't.
[25:37.160 --> 25:37.440]  Yeah, I guess.
[25:37.560 --> 25:37.980]  Oh, what happened?
[25:38.840 --> 25:40.580]  I just felt terrible yesterday.
[25:40.800 --> 25:43.140]  I felt I sounded worse yesterday than I do today.
[25:43.580 --> 25:43.920]  Wow.
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.120]  But we're close.
[25:45.260 --> 25:45.640]  We're close.
[25:45.700 --> 25:46.620]  We got the components.
[25:46.800 --> 25:47.700]  We're very excited now.
[25:47.900 --> 25:48.660]  Very excited.
[25:49.140 --> 25:51.720]  What are you actually doing that keeps triggering your gag reflex?
[25:52.720 --> 25:53.520]  Vomiting acid.
[25:53.620 --> 25:54.280]  I went over this.
[25:54.280 --> 25:55.400]  It was the whole beginning of the show.
[25:56.060 --> 25:58.180]  No, but I'm saying what causes that?
[25:58.600 --> 26:05.700]  Oh, I go like I'm trying to cough up phlegm and then I push it a little too hard.
[26:07.520 --> 26:07.920]  Okay.
[26:08.340 --> 26:10.600]  And then I cross a point of no return.
[26:13.800 --> 26:15.260]  Have you never done that?
[26:15.880 --> 26:16.300]  Oh, yeah.
[26:17.340 --> 26:18.220]  Well, here we go.
[26:18.600 --> 26:19.800]  You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[26:19.840 --> 26:23.360]  You just made it sound like you kept trying something and then you gagged.
[26:23.900 --> 26:31.000]  Well, I was trying to cough phlegm up and then I, you know, I was successful and some,
[26:31.760 --> 26:32.220]  unfortunately.
[26:32.880 --> 26:33.300]  Bad play.
[26:33.640 --> 26:36.000]  But listen, I learned my lesson two times.
[26:36.540 --> 26:37.500]  Not going to happen a third.
[26:38.260 --> 26:39.420]  Ain't going to happen a third.
[26:39.660 --> 26:40.220]  Fool me twice.
[26:42.840 --> 26:47.440]  Building a portfolio with Fidelity Basket Portfolios is kind of like making a sandwich.

[27:12.460 --> 27:16.400]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino Blended Beverage at Starbucks.
[27:16.720 --> 27:19.600]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[27:19.600 --> 27:23.280]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[27:23.680 --> 27:25.160]  Available for a limited time.
[27:25.400 --> 27:27.440]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[27:28.120 --> 27:29.440]  Hey, it's Paris.
[27:29.900 --> 27:32.040]  You know I love sparkly things, right?
[27:32.280 --> 27:33.060]  Like stars.
[27:33.500 --> 27:33.780]  Duh.
[27:34.280 --> 27:37.920]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[27:38.540 --> 27:42.840]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[27:43.340 --> 27:47.620]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[27:48.160 --> 27:50.600]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[27:51.000 --> 27:51.840]  That's hot.

[27:55.820 --> 27:57.320]  Hilton for the stay.
[27:57.780 --> 27:58.700]  Okay, a fuller fuller.
[27:58.740 --> 28:02.560]  I got some beef with Warner Brothers.
[28:02.800 --> 28:03.120]  Ooh.
[28:03.260 --> 28:03.860]  I'm mad at Warner Brothers.
[28:05.140 --> 28:06.300]  I'm upset with them.
[28:07.000 --> 28:08.100]  They've done me.
[28:08.180 --> 28:10.660]  First of all, we don't have jobs.
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.840]  That was unfortunate.
[28:12.280 --> 28:14.720]  Second of all, I'm kind of okay with it.
[28:15.440 --> 28:18.140]  Even even more offensive.
[28:18.880 --> 28:20.240]  Those sons of bitches.
[28:20.740 --> 28:26.100]  They're filming The Last of Us Season 2 where I live for six weeks.
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.780]  They're filming it in the downtown core, which is a street where I live.
[28:33.500 --> 28:39.040]  And my problem with this is for six weeks, it's going to be shut down.
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.200]  And the best donut shop in the city is on that street.
[28:42.580 --> 28:44.180]  No donuts for six weeks.
[28:44.180 --> 28:45.780]  All because of The Last of Us 2.
[28:45.960 --> 28:47.320]  I'm so annoyed.
[28:47.780 --> 28:52.700]  I'm so fucking mad at these stupid clickers and these fireflies.
[28:53.440 --> 28:56.560]  If you get a job as background, though, can you just keep going to the donut shop?
[28:57.320 --> 28:58.920]  No, because it's closed.
[28:59.100 --> 28:59.580]  They're just not...
[28:59.580 --> 29:00.280]  Close to crew?
[29:00.340 --> 29:01.020]  All the businesses.
[29:01.640 --> 29:02.080]  Yeah.
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.440]  No, all of the businesses are shutting down and they're being compensated that week.
[29:07.820 --> 29:09.080]  So here's what's going to happen.
[29:09.080 --> 29:09.640]  Those weeks.
[29:10.180 --> 29:12.760]  That business, that donut shop, when does this take place?
[29:13.400 --> 29:14.360]  Like next week.
[29:14.700 --> 29:15.620]  Okay, you've got time.
[29:16.020 --> 29:16.240]  All right.
[29:17.060 --> 29:18.860]  Do they know you by face at the donut shop?
[29:19.480 --> 29:19.800]  No.
[29:20.320 --> 29:21.580]  No, but you go there a lot, right?
[29:21.800 --> 29:23.140]  Yeah, I go there sometimes.
[29:23.280 --> 29:29.760]  And I know you're personable in person because you turned the entire Canadian bagel industry
[29:29.760 --> 29:30.440]  upside down.
[29:32.600 --> 29:36.080]  So when you have a product like the regulation bagel, it's hard not to.
[29:36.240 --> 29:36.580]  Exactly.
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.020]  And so the reason I bring that up is that the people know of you now in that community,
[29:41.100 --> 29:41.340]  I'm sure.
[29:41.700 --> 29:42.500]  So here's what you do.
[29:42.500 --> 29:45.940]  You go into your donut shop and you go, listen, I heard you guys are getting a week off.
[29:47.180 --> 29:48.080]  Full pay, right?
[29:48.360 --> 29:50.860]  What's better than getting a week off full pay?
[29:51.440 --> 29:57.000]  How about getting full pay, but also working about half as hard as normal, running an illegal
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.680]  fucking fly-by-night donut shop at the back of the store.
[30:01.000 --> 30:02.620]  They don't have to know what's going on.
[30:02.840 --> 30:04.880]  We'll keep the curtains closed.
[30:05.460 --> 30:07.840]  Keep the shutters drawn, right?
[30:07.840 --> 30:11.260]  And you could even become a distributor for them.
[30:11.540 --> 30:14.800]  They could compile a list of their best customers.
[30:15.240 --> 30:19.380]  And then you could do secret orders by night and you could be a runner for them.
[30:19.440 --> 30:22.220]  And you could be the guy that delivers the donuts.
[30:22.380 --> 30:24.120]  And then you can always take a little bit just for you.
[30:24.280 --> 30:26.660]  It could be wildly profitable for everybody involved.
[30:27.820 --> 30:32.300]  I love the idea of seeing an episode like Ellie in the foreground searching stuff.
[30:32.360 --> 30:35.340]  You just see Andrew running through the background out of focus with a bag of donuts.
[30:38.440 --> 30:40.020]  That zombie's wearing shorts.
[30:43.420 --> 30:48.420]  I definitely want to steal something from that set, but I don't know when or how.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.640]  Probably would just end up being a poster, if anything.
[30:52.620 --> 30:58.140]  It's unfortunate with The Last of Us post-apocalypse, not exactly a lot being added.
[30:58.240 --> 31:00.020]  It's more removed, I would assume.
[31:00.420 --> 31:00.620]  Yeah.
[31:02.600 --> 31:07.360]  It's just it's going to be weird to watch The Last of Us season two be actively angry.
[31:07.840 --> 31:13.280]  At certain scenes, being like, they shut me down for this one sequence.
[31:13.460 --> 31:13.840]  It took six weeks.
[31:13.840 --> 31:16.120]  How many days do you get a donut from there?
[31:16.900 --> 31:19.300]  Not often, but maybe like once a month.
[31:19.720 --> 31:21.600]  So you're going to miss out on one donut?
[31:22.240 --> 31:24.620]  You're going to miss out on 1.5 donuts.
[31:25.340 --> 31:29.340]  There might be a time in which I really want a donut in that stretch.
[31:29.800 --> 31:31.120]  And I'm not going to be able to get it.
[31:31.340 --> 31:34.540]  Well, it sounds like you're not willing to go down there and do the hard work to
[31:34.540 --> 31:37.660]  talk to the owners to figure out how to sell donuts.
[31:37.660 --> 31:39.700]  And start an illegal donut ring.
[31:39.780 --> 31:40.260]  You're right.
[31:40.500 --> 31:41.660]  You called me on it.
[31:41.740 --> 31:41.980]  You're right.
[31:41.980 --> 31:45.480]  You would have made so much fucking money in six weeks and you would have been the hero of your
[31:45.480 --> 31:50.180]  entire community because you're not the only little boy in a room somewhere in Vancouver
[31:50.180 --> 31:53.280]  Island right now lamenting the fact that donuts are going away for six weeks.
[31:53.480 --> 31:56.460]  There's hundreds, if not thousands of you in your community that you could be servicing.
[31:56.780 --> 31:59.600]  But irrespective of that, just go buy a dozen donuts and freeze them.
[32:00.560 --> 32:01.580]  I guess, but I don't know.
[32:01.640 --> 32:02.640]  I like them fresh.
[32:02.800 --> 32:03.340]  I don't know.
[32:03.740 --> 32:04.140]  I don't know.
[32:04.300 --> 32:04.780]  That's true.
[32:04.780 --> 32:05.520]  I don't think it's the same.
[32:05.540 --> 32:06.760]  There's nothing better than a fresh donut.
[32:06.760 --> 32:07.760]  You're 100% right.
[32:08.460 --> 32:09.320]  Have you thought about just...
[32:09.320 --> 32:10.100]  They got cronuts.
[32:10.280 --> 32:14.520]  Getting the ingredients from them early and then making them at your house, Leah?
[32:15.040 --> 32:16.500]  I can't make donuts.
[32:16.680 --> 32:17.520]  I tried once.
[32:17.600 --> 32:18.480]  It was a disaster.
[32:18.560 --> 32:19.420]  You just need a fryer?
[32:19.700 --> 32:20.360]  How do you make one?
[32:21.100 --> 32:22.600]  Yeah, you get an oil in a pot.
[32:22.720 --> 32:23.840]  What if you did it with your Keurig?
[32:24.640 --> 32:27.900]  You put the oil in the back of your Keurig and heat it up.
[32:29.400 --> 32:32.220]  It just gets like infused with molten oil.
[32:32.220 --> 32:34.420]  Oh my god.
[32:35.020 --> 32:38.400]  Many years ago, I bought the Carmela Soprano cookbook.
[32:38.620 --> 32:42.340]  And one of the recipes in that cookbook was donuts.
[32:42.740 --> 32:45.720]  It's the only recipe I tried to make out of that cookbook.
[32:45.880 --> 32:47.480]  And it did not go well.
[32:50.020 --> 32:50.920]  Great book.
[32:51.700 --> 32:52.920]  There's a lot of lore in it.
[32:52.980 --> 32:55.120]  If you're a Sopranos fan, worth exploring.
[32:56.020 --> 32:57.580]  Pixie Dan's The Sopranos Universe.
[32:58.220 --> 32:59.680]  You didn't learn anything from it though?
[32:59.680 --> 33:02.900]  You didn't learn anything not to do for the next time you want to make donuts?
[33:04.160 --> 33:05.860]  I learned not to do it again.
[33:07.000 --> 33:08.280]  What went wrong with it?
[33:08.380 --> 33:08.880]  That I learned.
[33:10.440 --> 33:12.260]  They were kind of hard.
[33:12.460 --> 33:14.000]  They weren't all that fluffy.
[33:14.500 --> 33:16.040]  God, I'd love to watch you make donuts.
[33:16.280 --> 33:16.940]  I think it'd be great.
[33:17.300 --> 33:18.080]  I think you'd nail it.
[33:18.420 --> 33:19.780]  I'm not.
[33:20.380 --> 33:20.740]  I'm not.
[33:20.760 --> 33:21.240]  We could Twitch that.
[33:23.300 --> 33:24.520]  A donut cam?
[33:24.920 --> 33:25.140]  Yeah.
[33:25.860 --> 33:27.780]  Andrew in the kitchen making donuts.
[33:27.780 --> 33:31.500]  Do you typically go for a filled donut or a ring donut?
[33:31.640 --> 33:33.200]  Oh, I'm not a fan of the filled donut.
[33:33.280 --> 33:33.900]  I like the ring.
[33:34.140 --> 33:34.940]  I'm a ring donut guy.
[33:34.940 --> 33:36.360]  Hey, what's everybody's favorite donut?
[33:38.100 --> 33:41.700]  I like a classic plain ring with chocolate on top.
[33:41.840 --> 33:42.480]  I think that's a classic.
[33:42.700 --> 33:46.440]  And I don't mind the occasional sort of raspberry jam one filled.
[33:48.720 --> 33:54.280]  I think maybe like honey glaze could go for it.
[33:54.640 --> 33:55.400]  Honey glaze?
[33:55.400 --> 33:58.840]  I just stay away from all white goo on the inside of donuts.
[34:01.220 --> 34:03.860]  Are there foods that you go all in for the white goo?
[34:04.080 --> 34:04.920]  Oh, that's not a donut.
[34:05.300 --> 34:08.500]  Is that a bear cap or a cruel apple fritter?
[34:09.720 --> 34:10.500]  Not a donut.
[34:11.440 --> 34:12.560]  It's an absolute donut.
[34:12.940 --> 34:13.540]  Total donut.
[34:13.940 --> 34:14.460]  Yeah, it's a donut.
[34:14.620 --> 34:16.040]  Gracie says strawberry glaze.
[34:16.460 --> 34:17.220]  Nick says maple.
[34:17.740 --> 34:19.060]  You know what my favorite donut is?
[34:19.580 --> 34:22.320]  Just a fucking glazed donut.
[34:22.560 --> 34:23.720]  Just a normal ass donut.
[34:24.320 --> 34:25.100]  They glide down.
[34:25.100 --> 34:28.460]  You can just stuff like most of it in your mouth and they become nothing.
[34:28.560 --> 34:28.940]  It's great.
[34:29.500 --> 34:33.040]  I like every donut y'all have posted here and I would eat every one of them.
[34:33.120 --> 34:35.980]  But like when I think donut, I just want to eat a bog standard donut.
[34:36.380 --> 34:40.200]  There's something about you, Geoff, that that tracks with so hard for me.
[34:40.500 --> 34:41.040]  Like you are...
[34:42.180 --> 34:44.040]  If I had to guess, I would be like,
[34:44.180 --> 34:47.180]  that guy doesn't want anything going on except glaze it.
[34:47.220 --> 34:50.080]  And let me just fucking tamp these down my throat as fast as I can.
[34:50.240 --> 34:53.220]  So you're not a voodoo fan or a Gordo's?
[34:53.220 --> 34:55.220]  No, I like them just fine.
[34:55.440 --> 34:57.620]  I every once in a while on a Sunday will get voodoo.
[34:57.800 --> 34:59.500]  And you get like the sampler pack and they're great.
[34:59.680 --> 35:02.960]  But it's they're a fun distraction.
[35:03.140 --> 35:06.000]  But I'd be just as happy eating a regular donut.
[35:06.140 --> 35:09.620]  Like if you brought me 12 Krispy Kremes or 12 voodoo donuts,
[35:09.620 --> 35:12.540]  I'm not enjoying the voodoo more than the Krispy Kremes.
[35:12.580 --> 35:13.260]  That makes sense.
[35:13.580 --> 35:15.540]  Just Geoff sitting in his little booth.
[35:15.600 --> 35:18.000]  He's got his black coffee with nothing in it.
[35:18.040 --> 35:19.820]  His donut with a basic glaze.
[35:20.980 --> 35:22.120]  God damn right.
[35:22.120 --> 35:24.220]  70s beat cop style.
[35:24.460 --> 35:28.000]  Just sitting there enjoying the most basic thing.
[35:28.140 --> 35:29.460]  That totally makes sense.
[35:29.840 --> 35:30.020]  I do.
[35:30.280 --> 35:32.780]  Geoff's becoming more of a bog standard guy as he ages.
[35:33.400 --> 35:34.580]  Oh, yeah, could be.
[35:35.140 --> 35:41.560]  I think you just like at some point who you are going to be is cemented and who you are
[35:41.560 --> 35:46.180]  is probably some grown up version of what you thought grownups were when you were a kid.
[35:46.460 --> 35:51.400]  And so I think Eric's nailed it with the 70s beat cop because I grew up as a kid in the 70s
[35:51.400 --> 35:52.640]  and the early mid 80s.
[35:52.900 --> 35:57.000]  And so all the grownups that I was that I experienced through film and television in
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.960]  my life were kind of like that.
[35:59.060 --> 36:05.900]  Just like dudes with mustaches who drank coffee, black coffee out of a foam cup and ate regular
[36:05.900 --> 36:06.400]  donuts.
[36:06.720 --> 36:07.380]  You know what I mean?
[36:07.460 --> 36:10.880]  And like and didn't bother with ketchup or mustard on stuff.
[36:10.980 --> 36:12.580]  And that's who I'm turning into.
[36:12.740 --> 36:16.840]  And so I think I'm just a product of like the Rockford Files.
[36:16.960 --> 36:18.000]  Maybe you should have been a cop.
[36:18.240 --> 36:19.860]  Maybe that's why you like Twin Peaks so much.
[36:22.200 --> 36:23.220]  Jeff is a cop.
[36:24.480 --> 36:29.560]  Dude, I've been thinking about doing a full fucking Twin Peaks watch through again.
[36:29.620 --> 36:32.380]  Oh, I should give you a Blu-rays back then because you said you would never watch it
[36:32.380 --> 36:32.860]  ever again.
[36:33.500 --> 36:33.960]  I know.
[36:34.100 --> 36:35.240]  I know I said that.
[36:35.320 --> 36:35.980]  I know I said that.
[36:36.040 --> 36:36.640]  And I thought it.
[36:36.700 --> 36:37.160]  I meant it.
[36:37.200 --> 36:37.620]  But it's been...
[36:38.460 --> 36:40.320]  I need to go back and finish season three.
[36:40.540 --> 36:43.040]  And if I'm going to finish season three, I might as well watch season one and two.
[36:43.540 --> 36:44.940]  I'll give you your discs back.
[36:45.320 --> 36:46.660]  No, don't give them to me yet.
[36:46.840 --> 36:47.120]  OK.
[36:47.780 --> 36:48.600]  I might get distracted.
[36:49.160 --> 36:51.220]  Can I jog something back for a second?
[36:51.400 --> 36:56.320]  You were saying you would love to watch Andrew make donuts, set up a Twitch, and then Andrew's
[36:56.320 --> 36:57.160]  making the donuts or whatever.
[36:57.380 --> 37:01.840]  We couldn't even get this guy to film his hands playing this game with sticks.
[37:02.160 --> 37:02.960]  We're not going to get...
[37:02.960 --> 37:03.960]  What are you talking about?
[37:04.740 --> 37:07.040]  I don't know.
[37:07.120 --> 37:07.960]  I'm thinking maybe...
[37:07.960 --> 37:08.720]  Like, you're going to get him making donuts?
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.020]  Maybe the new thing could be Andrew turning over a new leaf with hand cam.
[37:14.360 --> 37:15.080]  Donut cam.
[37:15.440 --> 37:15.900]  2024.
[37:16.320 --> 37:17.660]  New leaf, new cams.
[37:17.660 --> 37:25.080]  I just think a GoPro on your chest would lead to such immense content just throughout your life.
[37:25.320 --> 37:25.360]  Donut cam.
[37:26.780 --> 37:27.640]  I agree.
[37:27.880 --> 37:30.160]  Thumb cam, donut cam, sushi cam.
[37:32.040 --> 37:33.220]  Sushi cam is dangerous.
[37:33.420 --> 37:34.480]  I don't know if we can use sushi cam.
[37:35.240 --> 37:36.860]  We got to be careful of sushi cam.
[37:37.680 --> 37:46.000]  I have another thing that, you know, talking about Easter eggs and secrets, kind of a big one.
[37:46.160 --> 37:47.100]  Kind of a big one.
[37:47.100 --> 37:48.580]  I've been sitting on a little bit.
[37:49.360 --> 37:50.060]  Tiny little bit.
[37:51.660 --> 37:54.280]  As you all may know, the company is, in fact, closing.
[37:58.380 --> 38:01.440]  And it's, yeah, really, Gracie, I'm sorry that you had to look this way.
[38:01.840 --> 38:02.800]  But it is.
[38:04.660 --> 38:08.840]  And I decided I'm going to, you know, I'm going to do something about this.
[38:08.860 --> 38:11.160]  I'm going to, I'm going to bring us back.
[38:11.540 --> 38:11.680]  Christ.
[38:11.880 --> 38:12.980]  It's what I'm going to do.
[38:13.220 --> 38:16.300]  So if you're listening to this, it is
[38:17.640 --> 38:20.640]  Wednesday, what day, April 24th, I think.
[38:20.720 --> 38:22.540]  What day is, when does this come out?
[38:23.940 --> 38:26.380]  Wednesday, April 24th.
[38:26.540 --> 38:29.060]  I am saving the company.
[38:29.540 --> 38:31.660]  I am invading the store.
[38:32.020 --> 38:32.480]  They're coming.
[38:32.720 --> 38:34.400]  I made a deal with the Chinese government.
[38:34.820 --> 38:35.680]  We got it exported.
[38:36.180 --> 38:37.720]  We got sticks coming.
[38:37.920 --> 38:43.540]  The last drop in the RT store, the underpant line to save the company.
[38:43.760 --> 38:45.280]  You can get your thumb sticks.
[38:45.280 --> 38:47.560]  Look at how fancy those thumb sticks are.
[38:47.760 --> 38:49.520]  They got two sets of them.
[38:49.640 --> 38:52.080]  You can get a clog tube.
[38:52.380 --> 38:54.320]  It is coming to the market.
[38:54.860 --> 38:56.340]  Look at how beautiful it is.
[38:56.520 --> 38:57.400]  It is there.
[38:57.660 --> 38:58.460]  It is sideways.
[38:58.780 --> 38:59.640]  It makes noise.
[38:59.800 --> 39:00.600]  It's a grown tube.
[39:00.700 --> 39:01.440]  It's a plunger.
[39:01.900 --> 39:04.620]  And last but not least, because we're going to need three products.
[39:04.820 --> 39:09.360]  We're going to save this goddamn company that I'm putting on my back here.
[39:09.360 --> 39:16.980]  We got the underpant bobblehead of me wearing a face of my face.
[39:18.140 --> 39:20.040]  Available 10 a.m. central.
[39:20.420 --> 39:21.980]  The last merch drop.
[39:22.580 --> 39:26.080]  I'm going to not save this company, but I'm going to goddamn try.
[39:26.480 --> 39:27.760]  Are you fucking serious?
[39:27.920 --> 39:28.400]  When is this?
[39:28.400 --> 39:29.320]  This is coming out when?
[39:30.220 --> 39:32.480]  This is April 24th.
[39:32.580 --> 39:34.180]  All of those releasing 10 a.m.
[39:34.200 --> 39:35.920]  I'm invading the store.
[39:36.320 --> 39:38.320]  There's going to be banners of me all over the place.
[39:38.320 --> 39:39.560]  This is my shit.
[39:39.820 --> 39:41.280]  I'm bringing this company back.
[39:41.840 --> 39:43.140]  Andrew is saving the company.
[39:43.700 --> 39:45.120]  But not saving it.
[39:45.120 --> 39:45.580]  It's dead.
[39:45.720 --> 39:46.740]  But I'm trying.
[39:47.100 --> 39:47.220]  Yeah.
[39:48.100 --> 39:48.900]  I'm trying.
[39:49.600 --> 39:53.500]  Someone should let Warner know, I guess, that the company is about to be saved.
[39:54.600 --> 39:54.800]  Yeah.
[39:55.060 --> 39:59.320]  I will tell them when they get here next week.
[39:59.420 --> 40:00.120]  I'll let them know.
[40:00.120 --> 40:01.900]  I'll go on the set and I'll inform them.
[40:02.940 --> 40:05.280]  And I think that's probably the easiest way to do it.
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.660]  Look at these fucking sticks.
[40:08.940 --> 40:09.140]  Dude.
[40:09.340 --> 40:10.240]  The precision.
[40:10.980 --> 40:11.460]  Precision.
[40:12.180 --> 40:17.000]  So we are very limited on the number of sticks that we're selling.
[40:17.200 --> 40:18.080]  Very limited.
[40:18.300 --> 40:20.840]  Because it was insane to get them made.
[40:21.380 --> 40:24.700]  But hopefully there's enough clog tubes for everyone.
[40:24.960 --> 40:25.700]  How limited are the sticks?
[40:25.720 --> 40:26.540]  There's not going to be.
[40:26.920 --> 40:27.060]  Yeah.
[40:27.920 --> 40:29.320]  It's a very low number.
[40:29.620 --> 40:32.180]  Can we just say what the low number is?
[40:32.480 --> 40:32.820]  Or do you know?
[40:32.820 --> 40:34.340]  I don't remember offhand.
[40:34.340 --> 40:36.080]  But it was substantially lower.
[40:36.240 --> 40:39.600]  And it's one of the most collectible items that we've ever made.
[40:39.780 --> 40:40.680]  Well, that's terrible.
[40:40.940 --> 40:42.460]  No one will get it.
[40:42.460 --> 40:43.360]  What are they going to do?
[40:43.400 --> 40:44.020]  What are they going to do?
[40:44.060 --> 40:45.260]  Complain until we shut down?
[40:45.340 --> 40:46.080]  We're done, Gavin.
[40:46.300 --> 40:47.020]  This is it.
[40:47.400 --> 40:49.760]  This is Andrew's last game.
[40:50.080 --> 40:50.980]  This is it.
[40:51.440 --> 40:52.220]  This is it.
[40:52.360 --> 40:53.320]  This is all of it.
[40:53.480 --> 40:54.040]  It's done.
[40:54.400 --> 40:54.840]  It is.
[40:54.980 --> 40:55.940]  We'll see.
[40:56.060 --> 40:56.920]  We'll see how it goes.
[40:57.060 --> 40:57.560]  We might...
[40:57.560 --> 40:59.260]  Everyone will be so mad.
[41:00.420 --> 41:01.540]  It is heartbreaking.
[41:01.540 --> 41:05.260]  A little heartbreaking to see the stuff that we had cooking.
[41:05.840 --> 41:06.580]  Oh, yeah.
[41:07.360 --> 41:09.080]  I'm just talking with merch stuff.
[41:09.200 --> 41:10.600]  Obviously, we're continuing.
[41:11.060 --> 41:17.060]  The company may be ending, but the podcast will soar to the heights of the most successful Falcons.
[41:17.880 --> 41:20.500]  But the merch is going to take a hit in the interim.
[41:20.700 --> 41:24.740]  We're not going to be able to invent clog tubes and shit immediately, probably.
[41:24.740 --> 41:32.480]  But Tony in a merch or an e-com, he put together just a graphic that showed everything we made,
[41:32.540 --> 41:35.780]  all the weird shit we made on ****face throughout the course of the podcast.
[41:35.960 --> 41:43.320]  And it's so wild to see all the dumb, wacky, goofy, ridiculous, broken shit we made.
[41:43.700 --> 41:47.820]  We should post that publicly because that is an insane mood board.
[41:48.040 --> 41:52.820]  If you asked me at the beginning to even list what's on there,
[41:52.820 --> 41:55.980]  I wouldn't have a clue what half of it is or how we came to sell it.
[41:56.440 --> 41:58.780]  You'd never be able to know how we got there, right?
[41:58.880 --> 42:00.340]  Like, yeah, it's crazy.
[42:00.840 --> 42:02.500]  We'll be sure to post it on social at some point.
[42:03.980 --> 42:05.200]  I'm glad this stuff's coming out.
[42:05.840 --> 42:06.400]  It is coming.
[42:06.600 --> 42:10.180]  It's a bummer about the super limited numbers, but the fact that it's coming out at all,
[42:10.440 --> 42:12.000]  I thought the store was done.
[42:12.360 --> 42:13.580]  I thought that they had closed up shop.
[42:14.180 --> 42:15.420]  All the items are gone from it.
[42:15.440 --> 42:18.880]  So the fact that there's going to be one last drop is a huge surprise to me.
[42:19.480 --> 42:20.640]  Last pant drop.
[42:21.520 --> 42:22.260]  And your pant line.
[42:22.260 --> 42:23.860]  You know what would make this more fair?
[42:24.860 --> 42:25.140]  What?
[42:25.280 --> 42:26.400]  Make it a literal drop.
[42:26.500 --> 42:28.120]  Make it a dead drop.
[42:28.740 --> 42:29.460]  What is that?
[42:29.520 --> 42:29.820]  What do you mean?
[42:30.160 --> 42:30.920]  Bury it somewhere.
[42:32.980 --> 42:34.720]  Oh, it's not that limited.
[42:35.040 --> 42:35.740]  More business.
[42:36.460 --> 42:37.160]  We should do it.
[42:37.160 --> 42:42.280]  We should normalize dead drops, buying stuff online, telling people where to dig,
[42:42.500 --> 42:44.980]  dig up the money, put the thing in the hole, bury it again.
[42:45.000 --> 42:45.680]  I'm all for this.
[42:47.460 --> 42:48.640]  I support this fully.
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.140]  I've always wanted to do a thing where we bury something and someone has to find it.
[42:53.600 --> 42:55.080]  I like this idea a lot.
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.820]  Although I don't know how you would leave money in and not have the person just walk off with it.
[42:59.940 --> 43:03.300]  Maybe just under slight threat, like I'm watching you sort of thing.
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.140]  Well, for most humans, I would think that, yeah, it'd be a pretty big concern.
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.200]  But for regulation listeners and comment leavers, they're top tier humans.
[43:14.480 --> 43:15.160]  You know what I mean?
[43:15.560 --> 43:17.740]  Like they're the the cream of the crop.
[43:17.740 --> 43:23.580]  They're not going to do anything non-regulation in a situation like this.
[43:23.860 --> 43:24.160]  That's fair.
[43:25.240 --> 43:26.180]  I would agree with that.
[43:26.520 --> 43:27.300]  The patent dead drop.
[43:27.400 --> 43:28.120]  I would also agree.
[43:28.500 --> 43:29.140]  The patent...
[43:29.140 --> 43:30.420]  Okay, here's what we're going to do.
[43:30.420 --> 43:32.820]  Very much bring the company a live drop.
[43:33.440 --> 43:34.400]  That's what it is.
[43:34.760 --> 43:35.820]  Here's what we're going to do.
[43:35.980 --> 43:42.620]  Can we get one of each of those three items, Eric, so that we can take it somewhere in Austin
[43:42.620 --> 43:46.200]  and bury it and then figure out how to give the audience the coordinates to find it?
[43:47.300 --> 43:48.380]  I'll get the items.
[43:48.460 --> 43:51.020]  I don't want anything to do with any of the rest of this.
[43:52.460 --> 43:55.360]  I don't like burying.
[43:55.760 --> 43:56.880]  I don't like giving coordinates.
[43:57.360 --> 43:58.000]  I don't want...
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.860]  The funny thing is you could give the coordinates to like the middle of a baseball field if you
[44:01.860 --> 44:02.860]  wanted to be carnage.
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.440]  Yeah, I mean, it is just...
[44:05.440 --> 44:06.340]  I don't want anything to do.
[44:06.420 --> 44:08.180]  I'll get you the items, but that's it.
[44:08.700 --> 44:09.180]  Sounds good.
[44:10.140 --> 44:11.000]  That's all we need.
[44:11.400 --> 44:13.320]  Would you give me a ride to my burial spot?
[44:15.020 --> 44:17.340]  Where you're going to be buried, absolutely.
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.160]  I've determined that I only ever get a ride with Eric if we're about to do something weird.
[44:26.260 --> 44:28.760]  Oh, yeah, because you run over the jackhammer.
[44:29.020 --> 44:29.720]  That was good.
[44:29.780 --> 44:30.300]  The jackhammer.
[44:30.560 --> 44:31.440]  We run over the jackhammer together.
[44:32.100 --> 44:32.960]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:33.040 --> 44:33.660]  We moved.
[44:34.080 --> 44:35.800]  We moved a couch the other day.
[44:35.960 --> 44:37.920]  We helped move a couch.
[44:38.660 --> 44:39.540]  Very weird.
[44:39.900 --> 44:40.940]  Weird situations.
[44:42.420 --> 44:45.480]  How did you get roped into moving somebody's couch?
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.140]  Yeah, I really like... I love helping people move.
[44:50.500 --> 44:51.620]  And that may sound strange.
[44:51.640 --> 44:51.860]  Really?
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.260]  I hate moving my own stuff, but if it's other people's shit, love it.
[44:56.600 --> 44:57.520]  I'll do that all day.
[44:58.060 --> 44:59.060]  That's so interesting.
[44:59.080 --> 45:10.040]  I had to move a couch recently into my storage unit, and I just waited until Gavin was at my house and he couldn't leave and then I...
[45:10.040 --> 45:10.700]  That makes sense.
[45:10.700 --> 45:13.300]  Well, originally you'd asked Eric, so Eric went already.
[45:13.440 --> 45:13.620]  Oh, yeah.
[45:13.660 --> 45:14.600]  I was like, I'll help too.
[45:14.720 --> 45:17.380]  And then I arrived before Eric, and we kind of did it before Eric even arrived.
[45:17.540 --> 45:17.940]  You guys did it.
[45:17.940 --> 45:21.080]  I showed up and I was like, I guess I'll supervise.
[45:21.280 --> 45:21.920]  Good work.
[45:22.080 --> 45:22.840]  Yeah, get it in there.
[45:22.920 --> 45:31.820]  Although the strange thing was, when we were taking it to its next location, you just decided to walk next to us instead of bringing all the cushions, which I thought was a strange move.
[45:31.820 --> 45:34.840]  Yeah, I thought, you know, I'm supervising.
[45:34.900 --> 45:37.080]  I'm making sure it's all on the up and up, you know?
[45:37.160 --> 45:37.780]  You did a great job.
[45:37.780 --> 45:42.380]  That whole job site worked perfectly.
[45:43.520 --> 45:44.640]  I'm glad you like it.
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.900]  It's just, as somebody who doesn't drive, Gavin, it's wild to think that you got roped into moving.
[45:50.360 --> 45:53.380]  You'd just be so low on the list as someone who doesn't actively drive.
[45:53.380 --> 45:55.820]  Yeah, I took an Uber to help someone move.
[45:57.520 --> 46:04.280]  Part of it might also be, Andrew, I make a point in my life of never asking anyone for anything.
[46:04.600 --> 46:07.340]  Not like never, but almost never.
[46:07.820 --> 46:12.260]  On the rare, rare, rare occasion where I can't figure it out on my own and I need help,
[46:12.400 --> 46:16.180]  people are so taken aback by the fact that I'm asking, they don't think to say no.
[46:17.240 --> 46:19.320]  Ah, that's a life pro tip for you.
[46:19.600 --> 46:21.620]  Never ask anyone for anything ever.
[46:22.060 --> 46:24.160]  So on the rare occasion when you actually need help,
[46:24.420 --> 46:28.400]  they'll be more confused that you asked and they'll help.
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.300]  Do I have one of those banks with you then?
[46:30.360 --> 46:32.420]  Because I feel like I'm not a big asker either.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.800]  Oh, you definitely have one of those banks.
[46:35.800 --> 46:38.960]  I mean, yeah, man, you have a lifetime of those with me.
[46:39.040 --> 46:41.720]  You used one not too long ago, but you have a lifetime of them.
[46:42.220 --> 46:43.400]  A lifetime of them.
[46:44.040 --> 46:44.160]  Okay.
[46:45.180 --> 46:47.940]  I mean, if he at least owes you a couch move.
[46:48.240 --> 46:51.760]  Yeah, dude, you could cash in daily if you want to. I don't care.
[46:52.680 --> 46:52.820]  Huh.
[46:55.060 --> 46:57.680]  Do you have anything that you're thinking about cashing in on, Gavin?
[46:57.780 --> 46:58.960]  Well, it's definitely something to think about.
[47:00.420 --> 47:02.200]  Yeah, that was why I asked.
[47:03.260 --> 47:04.300]  The answer was no.
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.020]  But I appreciate you fancied it up. You really styled that no.
[47:11.120 --> 47:12.280]  Good job, man.
[47:13.740 --> 47:17.520]  That's what, 15 years of podcasting at work right there.
[47:18.880 --> 47:19.680]  Well, I don't want to rush it.
[47:19.820 --> 47:20.740]  Sharpen those skills.
[47:20.920 --> 47:25.740]  No, listen, I'm impressed. Iron is sharp over there.
[47:28.740 --> 47:31.620]  I could have you take over one of my handjob shifts.
[47:33.380 --> 47:33.980]  What?
[47:34.560 --> 47:35.860]  From last week.
[47:36.420 --> 47:37.820]  Yeah, yeah, I guess I could.
[47:37.940 --> 47:39.280]  I get that one to shift at the handjob.
[47:39.380 --> 47:42.560]  But that was your whole that was your dream, wasn't it?
[47:42.620 --> 47:43.200]  I don't remember.
[47:43.360 --> 47:45.700]  Every dream becomes a job if you do it wrong.
[47:46.480 --> 47:47.320]  That's true.
[47:48.760 --> 47:50.320]  Have you ever dreamt you were at work?
[47:50.560 --> 47:51.080]  Just working?
[47:51.860 --> 47:52.000]  Yeah.
[47:54.240 --> 47:56.640]  No, I have more dreams from back at school.
[47:57.820 --> 47:59.420]  I've never dreamt I was working.
[48:01.320 --> 48:07.280]  I've dreamt that I've I've been in UFC fights and those are terrible dreams.
[48:08.700 --> 48:12.080]  It's like somehow I've been signed up for this event
[48:12.080 --> 48:15.540]  and I'm like doing the walkout to the cage and I'm just going,
[48:15.820 --> 48:16.900]  I don't know how to fight.
[48:17.300 --> 48:18.280]  How did I get here?
[48:18.820 --> 48:20.300]  Why is this happening to me?
[48:20.400 --> 48:23.940]  I love dreams where you start beyond all the points where you could have pulled out.
[48:25.760 --> 48:27.280]  Yeah, but then I have to reverse that.
[48:27.340 --> 48:28.280]  I don't know if I talked about on the show,
[48:28.280 --> 48:33.240]  but I have dreams where I'm trying to get home and I get like I go in the wrong boat or something.
[48:33.460 --> 48:37.520]  And then I realize I'm in a dream and that if I just wake up, I'll be in my bed
[48:37.520 --> 48:39.600]  and I'm like, that's the greatest feeling.
[48:39.960 --> 48:40.940]  It's so exciting.
[48:41.340 --> 48:42.540]  Yeah, like a safety teleport.
[48:43.540 --> 48:46.820]  Yeah, it's it's the closest to teleporting I think I'll ever get.
[48:47.280 --> 48:49.320]  Do you ever go on a killing spree right before you teleport?
[48:52.960 --> 48:55.760]  I don't know if I've ever killed anyone in a dream.
[48:56.460 --> 48:57.880]  That's a really interesting question.
[48:57.880 --> 48:59.700]  I've definitely had to deal with a body in a dream.
[49:00.660 --> 49:01.060]  Yeah.
[49:01.420 --> 49:04.180]  Yeah, I dreamt I once dreamt that I killed Ray.
[49:04.600 --> 49:06.300]  I had to like fight it.
[49:06.300 --> 49:07.240]  And I was really panicked.
[49:07.440 --> 49:10.320]  It might be the most relieved I've ever been to wake up.
[49:11.100 --> 49:11.620]  Oh, yeah.
[49:11.840 --> 49:13.160]  Because I don't even know how he died.
[49:13.200 --> 49:13.980]  I just had his body.
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.540]  I just that made me think I did technically not a work dream,
[49:19.620 --> 49:25.460]  but I dreamt years ago before I even worked at Achievement Hunter in any capacity.
[49:25.460 --> 49:29.120]  I dreamt that I worked there and got fired on my first day.
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.540]  Because I made an inappropriate joke.
[49:32.840 --> 49:34.360]  I was let go immediately.
[49:35.540 --> 49:37.100]  Was it from your joke book?
[49:38.440 --> 49:40.520]  No, it wasn't that inappropriate.
[49:40.640 --> 49:41.500]  I don't even think it was inappropriate.
[49:41.760 --> 49:47.280]  I think it was something to do with like making a Nazi joke of some kind.
[49:48.220 --> 49:49.500]  And I was let go.
[49:50.080 --> 49:51.620]  And the officers in the mall.
[49:52.260 --> 49:55.120]  Why would you even start to broach what the joke is on this podcast?
[49:55.120 --> 49:57.160]  Because it wasn't an offensive.
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.240]  I'm just saying the genre.
[50:00.040 --> 50:02.320]  It's something to do with with like Hitler, I think.
[50:03.600 --> 50:04.600]  I want to say.
[50:05.100 --> 50:08.000]  And then when we first did, let's play, we did.
[50:08.260 --> 50:09.720]  We made a worms video.
[50:10.020 --> 50:11.240]  This is the first thing we did.
[50:11.640 --> 50:14.780]  And I tried to name my worm baby Hitler.
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.440]  And I had a flashback of my dream of am I going to get fired on my first let's play?
[50:20.260 --> 50:21.680]  Was I predicting the future?
[50:23.200 --> 50:24.400]  But it got blocked out.
[50:24.400 --> 50:25.180]  The name wasn't shown.
[50:25.720 --> 50:27.760]  I've been sorry.
[50:27.820 --> 50:28.060]  Go ahead.
[50:29.120 --> 50:29.620]  No, you go.
[50:31.420 --> 50:36.200]  I was just going to say I've been having a series of recurring dreams lately.
[50:36.600 --> 50:38.320]  I haven't mentioned you guys, but since we're talking about them,
[50:38.500 --> 50:41.680]  where I also wake up similarly relieved, but also kind of horrified.
[50:43.040 --> 50:45.580]  Where do you remember a couple maybe a month ago?
[50:45.580 --> 50:50.060]  Now I was eating a piece of Mike and Ike's and my fucking tooth fell out.
[50:50.140 --> 50:50.480]  Yes.
[50:50.940 --> 50:52.920]  And I had to get my crown put back on.
[50:53.680 --> 50:55.460]  Pretty much since that day.
[50:55.580 --> 51:00.880]  I almost every night I have a dream that I have to eat candy like somebody's making
[51:01.340 --> 51:04.480]  chewy candy and I don't want to and all my teeth fall out.
[51:04.560 --> 51:05.640]  And then I wake up.
[51:05.860 --> 51:10.140]  I have woke up with my hand at my mouth to catch my teeth coming out of my mouth.
[51:11.000 --> 51:16.020]  And it's the I wake up horrified and then so instantly relieved that I still have all my teeth.
[51:16.040 --> 51:19.940]  But it takes me a second every day to suss out what's going on.
[51:21.640 --> 51:22.080]  Sucks.
[51:22.080 --> 51:23.540]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[51:23.800 --> 51:26.080]  Gracie just wrote about a dream bubblegum.
[51:26.220 --> 51:26.780]  Losing teeth.
[51:26.920 --> 51:27.740]  Rips all her teeth out.
[51:27.860 --> 51:28.140]  Terrible gum.
[51:28.220 --> 51:28.380]  Yeah.
[51:28.600 --> 51:30.700]  Oh, I don't like any of that.
[51:31.320 --> 51:33.340]  It's a relief to still have teeth.
[51:33.440 --> 51:38.160]  But man, do you have you like gained a fear of people named Mike and Ike?
[51:38.620 --> 51:41.220]  Are they up on the intimidating list for you?
[51:41.700 --> 51:46.580]  Oddly, I think I think it's if anything, it's improved the name Mike and Ike to me.
[51:47.200 --> 51:49.380]  I feel better about Mike and Ike as humans.
[51:49.500 --> 51:50.700]  I don't want to eat the candy anymore.
[51:50.780 --> 51:51.940]  I don't eat any candy anymore.
[51:52.080 --> 51:55.620]  Like I'm scared of all candy now, but which is probably a good thing.
[51:55.780 --> 51:57.700]  But yeah, I know.
[51:57.820 --> 52:00.120]  I just I just wish I didn't have these fucking dreams all the time.
[52:00.220 --> 52:01.740]  I've not come across a lot of Ikes.
[52:02.580 --> 52:03.640]  No, neither have I.
[52:03.840 --> 52:04.660]  Ike Barinholdt.
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.960]  Who is Mike and Ike?
[52:07.340 --> 52:09.160]  I just assume they made the candy.
[52:09.940 --> 52:11.300]  Do you think Mike and Ike are real people?
[52:11.800 --> 52:12.540]  I assume so.
[52:12.600 --> 52:13.040]  They were.
[52:19.480 --> 52:21.740]  Why did Mike and Mike and Ike broke up?
[52:22.080 --> 52:27.180]  Due to creative differences in the candy, Mike left to pursue a music career.
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.240]  While Ike pursued a career in art.
[52:31.200 --> 52:32.340]  What's going on with Mike and Ike?
[52:33.160 --> 52:33.900]  Are they at a reunion?
[52:34.420 --> 52:35.740]  Is Ike short for something?
[52:36.520 --> 52:36.880]  Ikel.
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.660]  You think it's short for Ikel?
[52:46.360 --> 52:47.640]  You killed Jeff!
[52:48.400 --> 52:52.420]  On the legal documents when they started the business, it was Michael and Ikel.
[52:53.380 --> 52:54.340]  Oh my god.
[52:54.660 --> 52:57.780]  Well, surely we can't call these candies Michael and Ikel.
[52:57.860 --> 52:58.860]  You gotta change.
[52:59.960 --> 53:00.900]  There's no fucking one!
[53:01.000 --> 53:01.660]  It's Ikel!
[53:01.860 --> 53:02.280]  No, man.
[53:02.300 --> 53:03.040]  It's Ike now.
[53:03.140 --> 53:03.700]  Yeah, I have no idea.
[53:03.760 --> 53:04.500]  What is that short for?
[53:05.240 --> 53:05.820]  I have no idea.
[53:05.880 --> 53:06.300]  I have no clue.
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.180]  You know what?
[53:08.220 --> 53:09.060]  I don't want to look it up.
[53:09.140 --> 53:10.220]  I want it to be short for Ikel.
[53:13.780 --> 53:19.960]  I never understood the whole Hank being Henry and John being Jack.
[53:20.580 --> 53:23.500]  I just don't know how one name could be another name.
[53:25.000 --> 53:26.240]  Always confuse me.
[53:27.260 --> 53:27.540]  Ikel.
[53:28.060 --> 53:29.160]  We're gonna keep with Ikel.
[53:29.220 --> 53:30.080]  I looked up the answer.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.080]  We're gonna keep with Ikel.
[53:31.280 --> 53:31.960]  Oh, you know the answer?
[53:32.200 --> 53:32.580]  It's definitely Ikel.
[53:33.060 --> 53:36.320]  I bet the real answer sucks, huh?
[53:36.400 --> 53:38.220]  It does, so that's why we're keeping with Ikel.
[53:40.260 --> 53:42.000]  Do you ever...
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.020]  I had a weird thought the other day.
[53:44.400 --> 53:47.920]  Are you ever relieved that you speak English over a different language?
[53:48.340 --> 53:49.280]  That's what you were taught?
[53:50.240 --> 53:51.440]  Uh, no.
[53:51.600 --> 53:52.820]  I was looking at...
[53:52.820 --> 53:57.120]  Because in Canada, a lot of things have English and French on them.
[53:57.600 --> 53:58.500]  And I was...
[53:58.500 --> 54:01.240]  I learned a little bit of French, but not a lot.
[54:01.740 --> 54:04.460]  This is the English word relief.
[54:05.560 --> 54:10.540]  This is the French word for relief.
[54:11.780 --> 54:13.540]  It's so much more complicated.
[54:14.100 --> 54:16.920]  I was really good at spelling in school.
[54:17.440 --> 54:20.040]  And I just, I don't think I would have been in a different language.
[54:20.200 --> 54:22.660]  That is so much more work for the same work.
[54:22.760 --> 54:24.780]  I feel like Germany over indexes in that.
[54:25.800 --> 54:27.700]  German words are very long.
[54:28.360 --> 54:33.740]  I just, I had never considered that a US spelling champion less impressive to me
[54:33.740 --> 54:35.380]  than like a French spelling champion.
[54:35.960 --> 54:40.700]  I think English is probably the easiest language to be a spelling champion.
[54:40.820 --> 54:42.120]  I mean, I don't know.
[54:42.260 --> 54:43.880]  I think part of the problem with English,
[54:43.980 --> 54:45.860]  it seems intuitive to you because you know it,
[54:45.940 --> 54:51.160]  but it's a mishmash of styles and rules and other languages and words
[54:51.160 --> 54:52.220]  that contradict each other.
[54:52.500 --> 54:54.800]  And so I think it probably doesn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense
[54:54.800 --> 54:56.540]  to try to sit down and learn it.
[54:56.740 --> 55:00.720]  And so I wonder if you would learn the rules of another language
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.140]  and it would just be honestly a better built language.
[55:05.260 --> 55:06.840]  It might actually make it a lot easier.
[55:06.940 --> 55:08.660]  I don't know. I've always wondered that.
[55:09.060 --> 55:10.540]  It's definitely built better.
[55:10.720 --> 55:12.420]  I assume I know English is a mess,
[55:12.480 --> 55:16.500]  but it's just purely on a level of memorization of letters.
[55:16.800 --> 55:17.580]  It is easy.
[55:17.700 --> 55:19.580]  I found this German word that apparently means
[55:20.240 --> 55:22.640]  insurance company that provides legal protection.
[55:27.480 --> 55:28.520]  It's a...
[55:33.220 --> 55:42.860]  V-E-R-S-I-C-H-E-R-U-N-G-S-G-E-S-E-L-L-S-H-A-F-T-E-N.
[55:43.040 --> 55:44.680]  How do they do business cards?
[55:45.680 --> 55:48.980]  I'm not a fan of any word that ends in Shafton, to be honest.
[55:49.880 --> 55:50.500]  Shafton's good.
[55:53.750 --> 55:56.470]  Have you ever put that word into Google, Gavin,
[55:56.510 --> 55:58.770]  and tried to hear how they would translate it?
[55:59.290 --> 56:00.390]  Oh, that's a good call.
[56:00.470 --> 56:00.910]  That's a good call.
[56:01.170 --> 56:02.530]  Because it always...
[56:03.610 --> 56:05.150]  It sounds terrible in English.
[56:05.370 --> 56:06.490]  I can't imagine that.
[56:08.770 --> 56:10.770]  Rish-da-per-sha-sha-f...
[56:14.030 --> 56:16.350]  Rish-da-sha-sha-fresh-a-dum-ber.
[56:18.210 --> 56:18.850]  Oh, I found a video.
[56:19.150 --> 56:21.410]  Nick's like a baby.
[56:21.550 --> 56:23.850]  I just make funny noises and he kills them.
[56:24.310 --> 56:26.150]  Rish-da-per-sha-fresh-a-dum-ber-dum-ber.
[56:27.210 --> 56:28.530]  And a little baby down there.
[56:28.930 --> 56:30.350]  Ooh, goo-goo.
[56:30.490 --> 56:31.790]  No, Nick, don't.
[56:32.030 --> 56:32.370]  No.
[56:34.650 --> 56:34.950]  Don't.
[56:35.070 --> 56:36.090]  You crossed the line.
[56:36.270 --> 56:38.110]  Wow, it said real quick in German.
[56:38.590 --> 56:39.290]  All right, say it.
[56:39.990 --> 56:41.190]  Like, I just, I can't.
[56:41.730 --> 56:42.450]  I mean, the German...
[56:42.450 --> 56:43.050]  Oh, just copy what it...
[56:43.050 --> 56:43.650]  You just heard it.
[56:43.710 --> 56:44.090]  Just copy...
[56:44.090 --> 56:44.550]  You just heard it.
[56:44.670 --> 56:44.990]  Just say it.
[56:45.030 --> 56:45.490]  It'd be a fucking...
[56:46.090 --> 56:46.830]  It's... no, it's hard.
[56:47.050 --> 56:48.450]  Just look at this.
[56:48.990 --> 56:49.910]  It's harder than it looks.
[56:50.810 --> 56:51.730]  Oh, shit, what's that?
[56:51.970 --> 56:52.590]  Is that the real link?
[56:52.870 --> 56:54.290]  It's a Google link.
[56:54.370 --> 56:55.310]  What are you doing, man?
[56:55.810 --> 56:57.730]  Just... Google says it, then you say it.
[56:58.770 --> 57:02.410]  I mean, you both weren't showing up, so I couldn't quite hear it, but...
[57:02.410 --> 57:03.490]  I didn't say fucking anything.
[57:05.490 --> 57:07.970]  Why are you sending me a video that's a minute long?
[57:08.250 --> 57:09.410]  I don't know why it's a minute long.
[57:09.470 --> 57:10.690]  I don't know why the guy made it a minute long.
[57:11.390 --> 57:12.910]  Gavin... so you can monetize it.
[57:13.690 --> 57:14.890]  Gavin is right.
[57:15.350 --> 57:17.750]  He says it so fast.
[57:17.950 --> 57:18.110]  Yeah.
[57:18.230 --> 57:21.890]  And then to have to repeat that, no fucking shot.
[57:22.470 --> 57:24.530]  Everybody shut up for three seconds.
[57:29.650 --> 57:29.970]  Rich.
[57:30.030 --> 57:30.350]  Rich.
[57:30.730 --> 57:30.890]  Fuss.
[57:30.910 --> 57:31.070]  Fuss.
[57:31.230 --> 57:31.310]  Shuffle.
[57:31.550 --> 57:31.690]  Shuffle.
[57:31.730 --> 57:31.770]  Shuffle.
[57:31.770 --> 57:31.870]  Shuffle.
[57:31.870 --> 57:31.890]  Shuffle.
[57:31.890 --> 57:32.390]  Yeah, there you go.
[57:32.830 --> 57:33.210]  There you go.
[57:33.210 --> 57:34.870]  Hold on, I still am watching this ad.
[57:35.090 --> 57:35.570]  Hold on a second.
[57:35.990 --> 57:36.190]  Easy.
[57:37.690 --> 57:38.010]  Easy.
[57:38.150 --> 57:38.830]  Feed me up again.
[57:39.230 --> 57:42.190]  Gavin asked me if I have a lawyer that I...
[57:42.190 --> 57:43.030]  a law firm I like using.
[57:43.070 --> 57:46.430]  What would you recommend if I need something fixed, but I also need, like, legal advice?
[57:47.610 --> 57:48.150]  Oh, it's easy.
[57:48.150 --> 57:49.670]  You definitely want to go check out...
[57:52.150 --> 57:54.590]  I mean, with this and your Hitler joke, you're...
[57:55.670 --> 57:56.590]  doing full offensive.
[57:56.630 --> 57:57.970]  No, I'm just saying the word.
[57:58.410 --> 57:59.950]  I don't know.
[58:00.650 --> 58:01.070]  I am.
[58:01.150 --> 58:01.390]  Yeah.
[58:01.570 --> 58:02.270]  According to Google.
[58:03.530 --> 58:05.090]  If it's wrong, it's Google's fault.
[58:05.590 --> 58:06.250]  It's not my fault.
[58:06.490 --> 58:07.310]  Geoff, did you get ears on it?
[58:08.450 --> 58:09.290]  You guys are talking.
[58:09.390 --> 58:09.770]  Hold on a second.
[58:09.830 --> 58:10.570]  If you're quiet right now.
[58:11.570 --> 58:11.990]  Oh, okay.
[58:12.070 --> 58:12.390]  Hold on.
[58:13.670 --> 58:13.830]  Yeah.
[58:13.970 --> 58:16.070]  Retsko is supposed to go into a divestment.
[58:16.070 --> 58:16.590]  Yeah.
[58:17.490 --> 58:18.130]  Easy.
[58:18.510 --> 58:19.030]  That's easy.
[58:19.270 --> 58:23.730]  I didn't realize the Swedish chef spoke German is what I've learned from this.
[58:26.010 --> 58:27.850]  Does it sounds very Swedish?
[58:27.950 --> 58:29.570]  Chef is chef.
[58:31.050 --> 58:32.790]  Jeff is Swedish.
[58:33.090 --> 58:34.850]  The Swedish Jeff.
[58:35.790 --> 58:37.070]  Swedish Jeff.
[58:37.330 --> 58:38.850]  Just say that German word again.
[58:38.910 --> 58:39.530]  Sweet chef.
[58:39.850 --> 58:45.290]  I like Swedish Jeff a lot.
[58:46.250 --> 58:50.810]  Speaking of Swedish Jeff, I've been having an idea.
[58:51.790 --> 58:54.370]  And I don't know how to bring it up with you guys, because I don't know how it'll affect
[58:54.370 --> 58:54.930]  the podcast.
[58:55.230 --> 58:56.010]  I want to see what you guys...
[58:56.010 --> 58:58.190]  Maybe we can come up with some creative solutions for it.
[59:00.590 --> 59:03.590]  It's been nagging at me for a couple of weeks now.
[59:04.750 --> 59:06.210]  And it's not going away.
[59:06.270 --> 59:07.530]  I haven't talked about it with anybody yet.
[59:07.790 --> 59:12.950]  But I've been lately feeling very taciturn in general.
[59:13.570 --> 59:14.910]  What the fuck?
[59:15.010 --> 59:15.570]  You've been feeling what?
[59:15.950 --> 59:16.390]  Taciturn?
[59:16.790 --> 59:17.230]  What?
[59:17.770 --> 59:18.810]  Is that one of your new words?
[59:19.010 --> 59:20.190]  Like germane and...
[59:20.190 --> 59:21.230]  What was the other one?
[59:21.230 --> 59:25.590]  No, it's just like brief and short and not wanting to be very forward.
[59:25.610 --> 59:26.970]  Not like the word you used?
[59:27.750 --> 59:30.950]  It's a fucking perfectly normal word, taciturn.
[59:31.050 --> 59:32.210]  I don't understand what your problem is.
[59:32.230 --> 59:32.470]  Yeah.
[59:33.910 --> 59:34.750]  So normal.
[59:36.070 --> 59:39.050]  I gotta start a podcast with non-idiots someday.
[59:39.110 --> 59:40.270]  T-A-C-I-T-R-N.
[59:40.270 --> 59:42.270]  It's a shame Bernie was so annoying,
[59:42.270 --> 59:44.150]  because at least he had a fucking vocabulary.
[59:44.770 --> 59:47.850]  Anyway, I've been thinking...
[59:47.850 --> 59:49.110]  Gracie just saying, it's not normal.
[59:49.530 --> 59:51.270]  It's totally fucking normal.
[59:53.150 --> 59:53.950]  Understand words.
[59:54.070 --> 59:54.470]  Oh my god.
[59:54.630 --> 59:56.130]  Anyway, I've been thinking about...
[59:56.130 --> 59:58.990]  I'm really fucking driving it home to me right now.
[59:59.350 --> 01:00:00.910]  For the last couple of weeks, I've been thinking...
[01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:04.090]  I've had a strong urge to take a vow of silence.
[01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.430]  Oh.
[01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:07.310]  You think...
[01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:07.730]  For how long?
[01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.250]  I don't know.
[01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:11.310]  Yeah, that could affect the podcast.
[01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:14.790]  Yeah, so you know, the thing that we're about to go do,
[01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:16.750]  you think that now is the time for that?
[01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:17.970]  Yeah, I think...
[01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:19.130]  No, I don't think it is.
[01:00:19.210 --> 01:00:20.350]  I think I'm gonna have to figure it out.
[01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:21.250]  And I think it could be complicated.
[01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:28.070]  But I'm having an intense desire to not speak out loud at all to anyone ever.
[01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.170]  So you yourself would be taciturn?
[01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:34.990]  Well, I think I'm fairly taciturn as it is the last six months or so.
[01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:36.790]  But it's just progressing.
[01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:38.470]  I feel like it's leading somewhere.
[01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:40.330]  And I just wanna...
[01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.850]  I've been thinking a lot about monks and how they just don't talk for
[01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:45.550]  an undefined period of time.
[01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:46.570]  And just like until...
[01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:47.230]  And I just... I don't know.
[01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:48.550]  There's something appealing in that to me.
[01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:49.190]  I've done that.
[01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.770]  How long?
[01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:52.370]  Yeah, you did.
[01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:53.630]  Oh, you did. You did for years.
[01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.570]  Yeah, I don't recommend it.
[01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:59.250]  But you talked outside of school, right?
[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.850]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.110]  Yeah, a little bit.
[01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:07.430]  I feel like it might be different for me at 48 than it was for you at six.
[01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.610]  It would completely end most things in your life.
[01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:14.690]  I mean, can we come up with clever ways to communicate?
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:18.170]  Like, what if I had a really robust soundboard of things I've already said?
[01:01:18.790 --> 01:01:19.970]  You're just communicating.
[01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:20.990]  You're just making it harder.
[01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.670]  What are you, Andrew?
[01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.070]  That seems like an Andrew idea.
[01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.050]  Yeah, it does.
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:28.190]  So it'd be like, Jeff, what do you want for lunch?
[01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.150]  Well, yeah, if I hit the wrong button.
[01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.370]  You know, it's so stupid.
[01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:42.250]  It's so stupid.
[01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:52.830]  Clearly, the podcast is my priority over my own personal mental health and well-being.
[01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:57.430]  But I'm hoping we can come up with some sort of creative solution here.
[01:01:57.890 --> 01:02:02.750]  Maybe I just don't talk 23 hours a day or six days a week.
[01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:06.110]  But then one day I talk, like on Thursdays, I talk for an hour.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.190]  Stop talking to Emily, talk to us.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.570]  I've stopped talking to most people.
[01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.790]  What if you run, you just operate like an old electric meter?
[01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:17.090]  We'll put some money in and then we buy ourselves like 40 minutes of talk.
[01:02:18.450 --> 01:02:19.950]  Oh, well, that's interesting.
[01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:24.010]  Like you want, like, like, say, like you wanted to look at the Empire State Building.
[01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:29.170]  Or, yeah, the Golden Gate Bridge from, yeah, interesting.
[01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:31.570]  Yeah, just put a little coin slot somewhere on you.
[01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:34.670]  I have two, I have two thoughts, Jeff.
[01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.650]  One, we do a supplemental quiet cast.
[01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:41.430]  This is just silence.
[01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:44.370]  See how long before anyone is willing to speak.
[01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.190]  I think some people would fold over time.
[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.750]  Yeah.
[01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.610]  Second thing, maybe we go into record.
[01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.570]  Maybe we do like a day of silence going into recording.
[01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:54.870]  See how it feels.
[01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:57.830]  I'm willing to not talk to anybody for a day.
[01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.230]  Take a full day of silence.
[01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:02.030]  We don't take a 24 hours up to 24 hours.
[01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.950]  We start the podcast.
[01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:04.910]  Now, that's interesting.
[01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.210]  That's interesting to me.
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.490]  We're all coming into it on an even footing.
[01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:09.770]  That sounds so easy.
[01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:10.330]  Well, I am.
[01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.950]  Yeah, I don't, I don't think this will be tough.
[01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.950]  I don't think this will change anything, but I'm willing to do it with you.
[01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:20.530]  I feel like, though, everyone is going to need to do it, including Eric, Nick and Gracie.
[01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:21.430]  Of course.
[01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:22.730]  I don't think that that's...
[01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:23.330]  No, I'm...
[01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:23.630]  No.
[01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:25.150]  No?
[01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.870]  Okay, never mind.
[01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.070]  Everyone seems on board.
[01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:29.730]  I just assumed people wouldn't be on board.
[01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:30.670]  Well, of course they won't.
[01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.070]  Eric can't do his job.
[01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.450]  Right. I mean...
[01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:36.470]  Yeah, because he lost it.
[01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:38.050]  What's your point?
[01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:41.030]  No, Andrew's trying to save it with a bobblehead and a plunger.
[01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.850]  We're fine.
[01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:46.690]  The company is in the shit, so I got the plunger coming.
[01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.630]  We're going to clear out of there.
[01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:50.410]  Sneak on through.
[01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:52.670]  It's also not something I have to do today.
[01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:54.830]  Maybe that'll be what I do after I retire.
[01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:58.350]  Or maybe I'll take a vacation and have a quiet vacation.
[01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:02.910]  But I like the idea of us trying it out for a period of time altogether.
[01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:07.530]  Yeah, I wonder if it'll have icy hot on the ear effects on the podcast.
[01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.390]  I also wonder.
[01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:10.890]  We didn't do ears, did we?
[01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:11.490]  We did balls.
[01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:14.150]  Yeah, do you think that...
[01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.850]  I did both.
[01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.890]  Do you think if you took an extended vow of silence, you could really zone in
[01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:22.770]  by putting icy hot on your balls and staying silent?
[01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.170]  Like, you'd really hone in on the silence?
[01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.750]  Nah, it would just be desk plunger.
[01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:32.050]  No, yeah, I think I'd like elevated silence.
[01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:32.970]  No, you don't?
[01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.290]  Okay.
[01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:34.350]  I don't think so.
[01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.190]  Maybe that's advanced.
[01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.070]  Maybe let's walk before we run.
[01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.270]  Okay, well, we need to wrap this one up.
[01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:45.970]  We only have a few of these left, so I really feel like you guys should leave people
[01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:48.030]  with something, like, really strong here.
[01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.870]  Could you walk on icy hot?
[01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:51.670]  What do you mean?
[01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:55.510]  If the floor was icy hot, would it hurt?
[01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:00.130]  Yeah, we gotta do that.
[01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.730]  I feel like the bottoms of my feet are very resistant.
[01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:06.870]  Do you think you'd taste the icy hot like garlic?
[01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.950]  Oh, you'd be putting so much...
[01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:13.970]  Like, you rub icy hot on your arm, and then it's slowly, like, I don't know,
[01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:15.170]  it permeates into the skin.
[01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:19.530]  But if you were standing on it, you'd have all the weight of you pushing down
[01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.930]  on the icy hot, compressing it and forcing it into you.
[01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.390]  And you'd be surrounded by...
[01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:27.850]  I bet maybe we should do an icy hot foot bag foot race.
[01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:30.830]  What about an icy hot slip and slide?
[01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:35.770]  Oh, god, that would be fucking great.
[01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.550]  Andrew!
[01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:38.470]  First off, Gavin, yes.
[01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:39.230]  Yes.
[01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:40.550]  Andrew, yes.
[01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:45.630]  We need to have the icy hot summer games where we just do shit in somebody's backyard,
[01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:46.990]  but it's all icy hot.
[01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:52.470]  How much money is worth of icy hot we're gonna have to buy for a slip and slide?
[01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:54.210]  We're gonna need to get a sponsorship.
[01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.750]  I wish that there was just icy.
[01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:02.950]  Icy hot, if you're listening to this, get after us. Let us know.
[01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:06.090]  Yeah, or Tiger Balm, or...
[01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:10.030]  Siliderm, or any of the other companies that make them.
[01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:12.010]  Yeah, Siliderm.
[01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:13.510]  I don't know, I made that up, but...
[01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:16.290]  Hey, Siliderm, if you're listening to this...
[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.490]  Derma Ice, or...
[01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:21.570]  And if we don't reply for a day, we were just in a vow of silence.
[01:06:25.850 --> 01:06:27.410]  Okay, wrap this up, we gotta go.
[01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:32.250]  All right, yeah, everybody's gonna leave with something important you said, Eric?
[01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:33.910]  So I'll go first.
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:37.310]  You are going to leave people with something important because we only have a few of these
[01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:37.890]  left, so go ahead.
[01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:39.970]  Here we go, and then somebody just go after me.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.780]  You're gonna go and then someone else will go?
[01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:49.790]  Okay, that was it.
[01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.070]  I gave the gift of silence.
[01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.450]  Pretty taciturn of you.
[01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.290]  Thank you.
[01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:05.050]  Nick has to edit all that, like, the sound effects in.
[01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:06.870]  They're, like, not in the recording.
[01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:07.390]  Who did the drums?
[01:07:14.550 --> 01:07:15.950]  Nobody else got anything, okay.
[01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:19.590]  Perfect.
[01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:29.490]  Hey guys, Major League Fan Jack here with a look at next week's episode of F*** Face.
[01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:32.150]  We are nearing the end and still trying to catch up,
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.370]  so here are some predictions for next week's episode.
[01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:36.370]  Andrew can't take it anymore.
[01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.650]  Jeff has yet another house problem.
[01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.530]  Gavin is planning a trip back to Sloppy Joe's.
[01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.410]  The boys have to change their name.
[01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:46.690]  Eric wants them to finish on time, for real this time.
[01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.470]  Nick isn't wearing the mask.
[01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.790]  And once again, Andrew does not eat the pencil.
[01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:53.670]  All that and more on next week's episode of F*** Face.
