[00:00.000 --> 00:03.660]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[00:03.940 --> 00:06.820]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love.
[00:06.920 --> 00:10.500]  Now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[00:10.940 --> 00:12.380]  Available for a limited time.
[00:12.640 --> 00:14.680]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[00:15.420 --> 00:18.760]  Hello and welcome to a regulation auction.
[00:19.120 --> 00:23.460]  I am here signed into my personal account for Prop Store.
[00:23.640 --> 00:28.120]  As you saw in the other video, we did some scouting and I am trying to secure
[00:28.620 --> 00:29.500]  a special lot.
[00:29.660 --> 00:30.560]  What's currently going on right now?
[00:30.620 --> 00:31.940]  Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
[00:33.500 --> 00:35.040]  Douglas Trumbull Collection.
[00:35.160 --> 00:36.060]  I don't know who that is.
[00:36.460 --> 00:37.400]  I haven't seen that movie.
[00:38.220 --> 00:41.260]  But our lot is coming up that we are excited about.
[00:41.560 --> 00:42.360]  If you scroll down...
[00:45.020 --> 00:45.580]  13...
[00:47.220 --> 00:48.120]  What is it?
[00:48.420 --> 00:48.980]  1374.
[00:49.600 --> 00:56.160]  Rick Santoro's aka Nicholas Cage screen match bloodied costume from Snake Eyes 1998.
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.800]  As well as 1375 Rick Santoro's Nicholas Cage's jewelry.
[01:01.340 --> 01:02.280]  Snake Eyes 1998.
[01:02.500 --> 01:03.560]  We're going back to 98.
[01:03.680 --> 01:04.800]  We've talked a lot about 98.
[01:05.840 --> 01:08.160]  Unfortunately, I'm the only one here with you.
[01:08.620 --> 01:09.860]  Everybody else is away.
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.040]  It's a Saturday.
[01:11.600 --> 01:12.440]  Not that that matters.
[01:12.640 --> 01:13.540]  It's completely irrelevant.
[01:13.640 --> 01:16.620]  I know I said that as if that impacts why people aren't here.
[01:18.280 --> 01:19.880]  But we ain't going to stop.
[01:20.020 --> 01:24.400]  We got to get this exciting auction coverage of us getting Snake Eyes.
[01:24.880 --> 01:25.640]  I'm so excited.
[01:25.640 --> 01:26.740]  I'm terrified.
[01:27.080 --> 01:28.520]  We're signing on my personal account.
[01:28.640 --> 01:29.960]  I'm trying to secure it for the guys.
[01:30.160 --> 01:31.580]  I can surprise them.
[01:31.700 --> 01:32.400]  That was a burp.
[01:32.460 --> 01:33.060]  Couldn't stop it.
[01:33.120 --> 01:33.800]  Sorry about that.
[01:34.000 --> 01:34.820]  At a later date.
[01:34.940 --> 01:37.620]  We're still just going through this Douglas Trumbull collection.
[01:38.540 --> 01:43.680]  Going piece by piece of the mothership landing site.
[01:44.080 --> 01:51.360]  Now, I currently have bids and I'm the top bidder and the only bidder for the Ricky Santoro full
[01:51.360 --> 01:51.840]  outfit.
[01:51.840 --> 01:55.820]  I had a little bit of a bidding war this afternoon over the jewelry.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.260]  I want to get it all.
[01:57.360 --> 01:58.780]  You can't have one without the other.
[02:00.200 --> 02:07.120]  So hopefully that person who bid on the jewelry is done and the outfit.
[02:07.280 --> 02:07.920]  I'm the only better.
[02:08.360 --> 02:10.440]  I have it at the lowest price I could possibly get it.
[02:11.320 --> 02:12.200]  Hopefully that's the case.
[02:12.300 --> 02:13.940]  It'd be just amazing.
[02:14.180 --> 02:15.700]  You know, we had the tuxedo in the past.
[02:15.780 --> 02:16.940]  We lost it, unfortunately.
[02:18.180 --> 02:22.180]  So to have this as a replacement would be incredible.
[02:22.580 --> 02:29.000]  It's screen matched as well, which means that it is identified as being used in the film.
[02:29.160 --> 02:33.960]  It is 100% a thing that Nick Cage wore during Snake Eyes, which is crazy.
[02:34.980 --> 02:39.420]  But we're at lot 1361, 1362, we're flying through.
[02:40.380 --> 02:42.800]  I'm guessing Douglas Trumbull had something to do
[02:43.460 --> 02:47.940]  with the story, but or what the close encounters of the third kind, because it's all.
[02:49.200 --> 02:55.360]  Third kind stuff, current bid is 800, which is the minimum to get it.
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.020]  Now, what I didn't know when talking about this with Gavin after.
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.140]  I don't know if it was in the recording or after we recorded last, but there is a
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.560]  buyer's premium where it's like you have to pay 25% on whatever the bid is.
[03:06.560 --> 03:14.540]  So that is the thing to be mindful of if you decide to try to do some of this auction stuff.
[03:16.540 --> 03:24.080]  I typically don't do this, but when you have an item like Nicholas Cage's fucking whole suit,
[03:24.300 --> 03:29.240]  whole set up from Snake Eyes, you got to, if you can.
[03:30.560 --> 03:33.820]  Very lucky to be in a position in which I can attempt to get these things.
[03:36.580 --> 03:39.040]  Oh, they're bidding $3,500.
[03:41.300 --> 03:45.240]  Our lots get close. We're like 10 away. It's going to move real quick.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.360]  Hopefully. Let's see what else is coming up. Is it all?
[03:50.660 --> 03:55.480]  Close encounters of the third kind? Douglas Trumbull, Douglas Trumbull.
[03:56.060 --> 03:59.640]  Oh, Slick's Jeff Goldblum shirt from Silverado.
[04:00.760 --> 04:05.460]  Was Silverado a movie? Did they make it into a film? I know it was a TV show.
[04:05.660 --> 04:10.720]  At least I think it was a show, but I think it was a show in like the 50s or 40s.
[04:11.160 --> 04:18.620]  When were they doing all the Western shows? 40s? 50s? I think it's 50s.
[04:18.820 --> 04:22.980]  Probably late 50s actually into the 60s, I imagine.
[04:25.040 --> 04:27.960]  Anyway, there's some cool stuff in this lot.
[04:30.200 --> 04:35.040]  There is the Benji thing we looked at before I decided as much as I like it,
[04:35.140 --> 04:40.120]  just because of how ridiculous it is. It's not even in like a movie thing.
[04:40.480 --> 04:44.740]  I watched what it was from and I couldn't even identify the moment which
[04:45.380 --> 04:49.940]  they were there in that outfit or would be needed as a stand in for that.
[04:51.100 --> 04:58.800]  That was one of the things we saved. I don't I know we looked at the Turbo Man stuff.
[04:59.640 --> 05:04.060]  From Jingle all the way to Jetpack, that was going up in price beyond what we'd want for it.
[05:04.120 --> 05:07.800]  Unfortunately, I was really excited about the booster action figures.
[05:08.740 --> 05:12.900]  Those have gone up beyond the expectation and way more than I would ever feel comfortable
[05:12.900 --> 05:19.420]  paying for something like that. Eric, I know and hate it, but all that small soldiers thing
[05:19.420 --> 05:24.080]  was really cool. It was a I guess if you didn't look at the other content or maybe
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.220]  I don't know if it was in it or if that was something I saw later, there was a chip hazard
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.420]  from small soldiers, like exact replica of the action figure.
[05:35.880 --> 05:39.000]  And it's awesome. It wasn't part of the movie.
[05:39.400 --> 05:44.740]  They did like a special edition where they made 25 of them and it was the same team that
[05:44.740 --> 05:47.760]  put it together for the film using the molds and everything.
[05:47.940 --> 05:53.440]  So it is as screen accurate as you could get without it actually being part of the film.
[05:53.820 --> 05:58.580]  And that thing is up to like $7000 last time I checked, which is crazy.
[05:59.640 --> 06:05.740]  As much as I love small soldiers, it's way, way, way beyond any amount I would ever feel
[06:05.740 --> 06:13.740]  comfortable paying. But this Trumbull stuff is still moving on and we're, I want to say,
[06:13.800 --> 06:19.120]  less than 10 away. I keep forgetting if it's 13, 74, 75.
[06:20.160 --> 06:24.980]  Either way, though, we're getting closer. Piece by piece. I mean, this is some pretty
[06:24.980 --> 06:30.880]  art. Let me click on this. Can I make it bigger? No, I can't.
[06:33.640 --> 06:39.300]  This is Caesars Universe Artworks. OK, so Robert McCall.
[06:41.860 --> 06:47.120]  Wait, Douglas Trumbull's collection. OK, so this is his collection of a hand painted
[06:47.120 --> 06:52.980]  thing by Robert McCall, who I also do not have a familiarity with, nor have I ever been to Caesars.
[06:54.300 --> 07:05.840]  That's cool. Dinosaurs and stuff. Very futuristic. They, um. I need to go back to you. Holy shit,
[07:05.900 --> 07:13.220]  we're already at 9,500. The expected range was 1,500 to 3,000. People really into this. This,
[07:13.480 --> 07:18.820]  I guess, is something that is more valuable or recognized than I realize. Actually, they might
[07:18.820 --> 07:28.300]  have a descriptor. Of. Bob McCall Caesar Universe Project with Casablanca Records and Film.
[07:33.140 --> 07:38.560]  Visual effects pioneer Douglas Trumbull was born in L.A. in 1942 after abandoning.
[07:39.200 --> 07:46.960]  OK, well, just it just reset. After abandoning architecture for technical drawing and
[07:46.960 --> 07:51.360]  cartooning, his talent for photorealism soon earned him work at Graphic Films,
[07:51.420 --> 07:55.520]  an esteemed Hollywood studio for which he designed groundbreaking cosmic effects
[07:55.520 --> 08:03.640]  for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Oh, he worked with Kubrick after Kubrick saw his work,
[08:04.340 --> 08:09.280]  hired him to create animation of these VFX shots, including the iconic Stargate sequence,
[08:09.880 --> 08:13.820]  what would become his Zenit reset. That's we got all we need from that. We got to start
[08:13.820 --> 08:22.300]  focusing in because we got Silverado, Jeff Goldblum, 1985. Current bid 700.
[08:25.020 --> 08:32.080]  Slick is a great name. For a Jeff Goldblum character. That's fantastic.
[08:34.920 --> 08:39.020]  Oh, do the Bartman hand painted animation cell with photocopy background.
[08:39.020 --> 08:46.080]  The Simpsons, Bart Simpson, do the Bartman. I loved the Simpsons soundtrack as a kid.
[08:46.220 --> 08:49.160]  Wasn't even really a soundtrack. It was like they released an album
[08:49.740 --> 08:55.760]  of original music or parody songs. I don't remember, but I would listen to that all the time.
[08:57.980 --> 09:02.800]  Hey, somebody hit the minimum bid. Someone is buying do the Bartman at $800,
[09:03.880 --> 09:09.680]  assuming no one else goes over. He's doing the whole fair warning is about to close.
[09:12.100 --> 09:15.580]  Now we got more Simpsons drawings for the show.
[09:18.780 --> 09:22.820]  There's part of me that wants to try to catch up and watch all the Simpsons again, but
[09:23.580 --> 09:30.380]  there's another part of me that is like, that's a lot of time for a thing that is by consensus,
[09:31.400 --> 09:38.120]  really not worth doing. I'm not that much of a Simpsons fan as much as like so many others.
[09:38.260 --> 09:42.100]  I love the first seasons, especially growing up. And then the video games that were around,
[09:42.280 --> 09:49.320]  like Hit and Run and Road Rage were fantastic. A lot of terrible Simpsons games as well,
[09:49.360 --> 09:52.600]  like skateboarding and wrestling. I actually never played the skateboarding. I can't comment
[09:52.600 --> 10:00.200]  on that one. But Simpsons wrestling, absolute disaster. So I guess I navigated through the
[10:00.200 --> 10:07.020]  bad games and mainly just played Hit and Run and Road Rage, which were incredible at the time.
[10:08.220 --> 10:13.900]  Being a kid who is not old enough to play like GTA three when it came out, Hit and Run,
[10:14.400 --> 10:19.460]  which is what they heavily advertised it as, is like, hey, you teenager, you kid.
[10:20.460 --> 10:25.280]  This is GTA for kids with the Simpsons. I was going to say with Sleepless in Seattle
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.940]  because this will popped up on the screen. Now that would be a wild combination. We're
[10:30.940 --> 10:37.500]  taking the Sleepless in Seattle IP and we're going to put it in a world filled with murder.
[10:40.780 --> 10:46.320]  Just insane crime, violence and explosions, because that's what that audience wants.
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.360]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to do list is
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.380]  a great feeling. And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you

[11:07.680 --> 11:16.920]  your needs. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there. Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly
[11:16.920 --> 11:23.480]  things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[11:23.480 --> 11:30.300]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream, making s'mores with the kids
[11:30.300 --> 11:36.140]  while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[11:36.620 --> 11:42.800]  That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for the stay.
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.460]  Now we're in Sleepy Hollow from 1999. Is that the Johnny Depp one?
[11:51.400 --> 11:57.980]  He was in that, right? Yeah, Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. That was from 99. That's crazy.
[11:58.940 --> 12:03.880]  I would have guessed that movie came out in like 2003. Anyway, we're getting closer.
[12:05.220 --> 12:10.020]  Oh, I'm getting stressed. I'm getting real stressed. We're coming up on it. Oh boy.
[12:11.640 --> 12:19.220]  Not a lot of interest on the Sleepy Hollow concept artwork prints. See? Oh man, that's so rude that
[12:19.220 --> 12:28.160]  they've done this. It's so rude that they've done this. Oh man. OK, well, current bid $4,000.
[12:28.580 --> 12:33.600]  It is the Small Soldiers limited edition Stan Winston studio box chip hazard toy replica.
[12:34.120 --> 12:42.100]  It is the thing I talked about. It is that $4,500 that is... $4,000 is like, oh my God,
[12:42.140 --> 12:46.880]  that's so much. And then on top of the buyer's premium, we're over $6,000 on this thing.
[12:47.440 --> 12:55.820]  That's too much. I do not. That is beyond any range I will ever have to be able to spend
[12:56.580 --> 13:00.440]  that much on a chip hazard, as cool as that is, I'm just going to appreciate it.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.800]  And these final moments looking at that photo. Oh, it's so awesome.
[13:07.000 --> 13:12.520]  They released a bunch of action figures in stores, and I had some of them as a kid,
[13:12.520 --> 13:17.900]  gave away a lot of that stuff when I grew up, which is like that was the right move because
[13:17.900 --> 13:22.060]  I'm not going to play with them all that much. I hope they went to other kids that got a lot of
[13:22.060 --> 13:29.440]  joy out of them. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go. This is us. This is us. We got the top bid
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.260]  right now. We're the current. We're the highest bidder. Snake Eyes, Rick Santoro's, Nicolas Cage,
[13:34.500 --> 13:40.140]  Scream Match, Bloody Costume. Come on, buddy. Come on, wrap this auction up, buddy. We're the
[13:40.140 --> 13:47.500]  highest bidder. Nobody come in. Nobody come in. Nobody come in. He's holding his gavel. He's just
[13:47.500 --> 13:53.020]  talking. He's talking. Oh, I want him in frame, but I'm also terrified that if I go, someone will
[13:53.020 --> 13:59.600]  come in. Lock it up, buddy. Come on, come on, come on. Why are you still talking? Come on. No,
[13:59.600 --> 14:08.480]  I bid a bid. Fuck. Fuck. OK, we're going in. Shit. Shit. This is terrifying.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.800]  OK, we're in a bidding war. I've never been in a live bidding war. Wrap it up.
[14:17.220 --> 14:21.460]  Wrap it up. Fair warning, this lot is about to close.
[14:23.660 --> 14:27.820]  Yeah, we got it. We got the Snake Eyes thing. OK, now we're on the jewelry.
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.140]  OK, we're the highest bidder. Current bid. OK, I'm going to bid on this.
[14:36.080 --> 14:39.560]  I keep clicking the wrong thing. This is his jewelry.
[14:41.560 --> 14:47.900]  Now, we had other things that we could buy that went to about a thousand. We're at 500.
[14:48.940 --> 15:02.750]  How much is that? OK, we're going to I'm going to have a limit soon. Fuck. Fuck.
[15:02.750 --> 15:08.290]  Fuck. OK, this is if they go to 2000, we're going to lose it.
[15:13.030 --> 15:17.610]  Fuck. I wish the guys were here. What do I do? What do I do?
[15:19.550 --> 15:22.990]  What do I do? We're at 2835. How much was the last thing?
[15:23.870 --> 15:27.730]  2500. They really were going back. Who's this son of a bitch?
[15:30.570 --> 15:32.690]  OK, we're done. We're done. This is it.
[15:33.390 --> 15:37.450]  We can't go more than this. It's higher than I would want,
[15:37.510 --> 15:43.590]  but this is a once in a lifetime thing. This is it. Are we going to get it?
[15:47.220 --> 15:54.740]  Come on, lock it up. Yeah. Oh, OK, well, that was more.
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.560]  That was more than any of us discussed paying for it. Oh, boy. It'll be that's fine.
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.100]  That's exciting. Listen, we got the thing. I got it for the guys. I secured it.
[16:09.060 --> 16:14.860]  Wow, I can't. Oh, I can't believe that. That's crazy.
[16:15.540 --> 16:20.120]  Fuck out of here, Jesse Eisenberg. Respectfully. Man, I'm sweating.
[16:21.220 --> 16:25.060]  I am. I can't. I'm never doing this again by myself.
[16:25.680 --> 16:28.300]  I need other people here for support if we're doing this.
[16:28.840 --> 16:32.500]  I am sweating right now. That was terrible.
[16:33.180 --> 16:36.500]  That was so stressful, but we got it. We got everything we needed.
[16:36.760 --> 16:40.760]  We got the suit. We got the rings. I'm excited to see Eric.
[16:41.220 --> 16:44.260]  The fact that we looked at buying a few other items
[16:44.260 --> 16:49.040]  makes me feel comfortable that we went over because this was our number one by far.
[16:50.160 --> 16:57.220]  You know, Jesus Christ. That was crazy. I need to lay down.
[16:58.300 --> 17:01.660]  Thank you so much for watching. I hope you enjoy this. I hope you enjoy
[17:01.660 --> 17:06.000]  the stuff we have planned with the suit. We have a new suit in our life.
[17:06.040 --> 17:10.840]  We have a new it's not a tuxedo, but we got a fucking Nick Cage worn thing,
[17:11.120 --> 17:17.060]  which is awesome for a ridiculous movie. We got the rings. It's so cool.
[17:18.180 --> 17:20.240]  Thank you so much for watching. I hope this is entertaining.
[17:20.380 --> 17:23.760]  I apologize that I was by myself. I did my best.
[17:25.100 --> 17:30.080]  I hope maybe there will be a recording. I wish you guys yell at me for going a little bit over.
[17:30.420 --> 17:34.940]  Who knows? I don't think so. I think we're all just going to be really excited. I know I am.
[17:35.620 --> 17:39.780]  This is another thing we talked about, actually, before I wrap up this soprano shirt,
[17:40.560 --> 17:43.200]  because I feel like I've seen Tony Soprano wear this thing a million times.
[17:43.260 --> 17:47.180]  But look at that. It's already 4,500. This is going to get so high, I think.
[17:49.540 --> 17:55.200]  And as I would much rather have the full setup for Snake Eyes
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.720]  than just the shirt of Tony Soprano, as amazing as it is.
[18:01.000 --> 18:07.440]  But they projected this to be 1,500 to 3,000 in value. Current bid is 6,500.
[18:10.420 --> 18:13.860]  Oh, man. I am lightheaded.
[18:15.180 --> 18:18.520]  I didn't even record this in the Discord call. Jesus Christ.
[18:18.540 --> 18:23.080]  I'm just coming to you. Anyway, I'm sorry. We're extending this. Let's just see how much
[18:23.080 --> 18:32.630]  this goes. Looks like it'll be 6,500. Oh, it went up to 7,000. Is this it?
[18:34.350 --> 18:39.950]  These people are sweating, I imagine. I couldn't imagine being live for this.
[18:41.790 --> 18:47.870]  I could never. Oh, the last second they come in, there's another bid. Oh, boy.
[18:49.230 --> 18:55.170]  I think there's a world in which someone could get addicted to doing this, and I'm glad that's
[18:55.170 --> 19:02.350]  not me. I'm glad I do not find joy in this chase. Even just watching other people have these last
[19:02.350 --> 19:08.910]  seconds go back and forth interactions terrifies me. But that's that. We wrapped it up. Thank you
