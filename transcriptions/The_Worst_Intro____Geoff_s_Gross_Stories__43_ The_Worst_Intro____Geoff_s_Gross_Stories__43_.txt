[00:30.100 --> 00:35.300]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 43.
[00:35.860 --> 00:37.560]  What do you got going on over there, Andrew?
[00:37.960 --> 00:40.640]  I'm just... I felt like you wanted some energy.
[00:40.780 --> 00:42.740]  I'm here. I'm bringing the energy for you, Jeff. Go ahead. Continue.
[00:43.240 --> 00:45.020]  Gizmo here just gizmoing it up. Go ahead.
[00:48.340 --> 00:52.860]  My name is Jeff Ramsey. Folks around these parts call me Baby Pepsi.
[00:53.400 --> 00:58.980]  With me, as always, Gavin or Gassy Goo, Andrew or Interrupty Gizmo.
[01:00.460 --> 01:06.540]  Eric or Lil Ricky B or the Mecha Nick. I saw a comment that really got to me,
[01:06.640 --> 01:09.660]  and I don't know why, somewhere on last episode. Somebody said,
[01:09.760 --> 01:12.380]  man, I haven't listened to Rooster Teeth in a really long time. I saw that you guys
[01:12.380 --> 01:15.380]  were making content. I wanted to check it out. I tuned into this Regulation Podcast,
[01:15.640 --> 01:18.760]  and you guys sound like radio DJs. And I was immediately turned off.
[01:20.620 --> 01:22.640]  Because you were doing your radio DJ bit?
[01:24.040 --> 01:26.600]  Yeah, because this is the first time we were doing the new nicknames.
[01:26.840 --> 01:28.380]  Gassy Goo and the Gizmo.
[01:28.780 --> 01:32.160]  Really fucked me up. I had so much fun doing that for one episode,
[01:32.260 --> 01:35.400]  and that has to be the one episode somebody tunes in and goes, what the fuck is this?
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.560]  Shut down.
[01:36.940 --> 01:37.840]  This is a Minecraft.
[01:38.540 --> 01:41.160]  Shouldn't we treat every episode like it might be somebody's first episode?
[01:41.500 --> 01:44.340]  What if they love Morning Zoo radio, though?
[01:45.020 --> 01:47.140]  Then they love Mechanic and Baby Pepsi in the morning.
[01:47.140 --> 01:49.220]  Welcome to the Regulation Pod.
[01:50.340 --> 01:54.240]  So I wouldn't say this one was much better, because this one had Andrew going,
[01:55.200 --> 01:56.560]  Hey, he threw the intro.
[01:56.940 --> 01:58.460]  That's right. Bringing the energy.
[01:58.920 --> 02:02.000]  I was already in my head before we started because of that comment,
[02:02.100 --> 02:04.200]  and then Andrew really threw me for a loop.
[02:04.520 --> 02:06.000]  Now I'm thinking we might be...
[02:06.000 --> 02:07.040]  Did my energy make you?
[02:10.760 --> 02:12.260]  You know what I was about to say?
[02:12.260 --> 02:14.560]  We might be in the running for a worse intro of Regulation,
[02:14.640 --> 02:16.220]  but that completely flipped it back around.
[02:16.480 --> 02:19.940]  Not with Rob64 at all.
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.520]  Yeah, Morning Zoo.
[02:25.840 --> 02:26.640]  This sucks.
[02:26.820 --> 02:28.940]  And Eric was doing this all throughout the stream the other day.
[02:30.480 --> 02:31.880]  Is it a voice changer?
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.040]  What do you have?
[02:33.160 --> 02:33.720]  It is really good.
[02:33.820 --> 02:35.660]  Yeah, it has a voice changer on that thing.
[02:35.960 --> 02:38.420]  Listen, boys, we have a lot to get to today.
[02:38.660 --> 02:40.600]  We have more than we can cover in an hour.
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.560]  There's a thing on my desk that Andrew sent to Gavin and I.
[02:43.620 --> 02:44.360]  We have to talk about.
[02:44.600 --> 02:47.220]  Last week, I told you guys about my Deja Vu nightmare.
[02:47.480 --> 02:49.080]  I got to update you.
[02:49.300 --> 02:51.300]  There are troubling developments.
[02:51.700 --> 02:53.500]  It is no longer a Deja Vu nightmare.
[02:53.500 --> 02:56.580]  It is just a midnight bathroom nightmare.
[02:57.620 --> 03:00.240]  I'm going to warn you guys now.
[03:00.780 --> 03:02.600]  Two of the grosser stories you're going to hear.
[03:02.960 --> 03:03.760]  Oh, no.
[03:04.820 --> 03:05.760]  Am I going to gag?
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.580]  Do I need a bag?
[03:07.000 --> 03:08.260]  You might need a gag bag.
[03:08.280 --> 03:09.420]  Can we do them at the end then?
[03:09.480 --> 03:11.340]  Because we've been front-loading gross.
[03:11.500 --> 03:12.360]  Can we put it at the back?
[03:13.120 --> 03:14.360]  Plus, I'll leave it up to you guys.
[03:14.400 --> 03:16.080]  Do you want to front-load it or back-load it?
[03:16.100 --> 03:17.200]  No, I want to back-load it.
[03:17.320 --> 03:17.660]  I've been...
[03:17.660 --> 03:18.640]  There's a lot of front-loading.
[03:18.840 --> 03:19.720]  There might be...
[03:20.340 --> 03:21.760]  They might take a little time to tell.
[03:22.200 --> 03:24.240]  And there'll be conversations.
[03:24.580 --> 03:25.840]  So we don't want to wait too long.
[03:26.020 --> 03:27.340]  Otherwise, we'll piss Eric off.
[03:27.680 --> 03:30.520]  We might need to make a uniform gag bag.
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.360]  Oh, interesting.
[03:32.860 --> 03:33.240]  Interesting.
[03:34.140 --> 03:35.020]  I'm not mad at that.
[03:35.080 --> 03:38.340]  I could have used that in fucking Los Angeles last weekend, let me tell you.
[03:38.520 --> 03:39.140]  Oh, God.
[03:39.220 --> 03:40.000]  Sorry, Anaheim.
[03:41.060 --> 03:44.680]  I am holding in my hand, Andrew, a gift from you.
[03:44.780 --> 03:46.880]  Would you like to tell me why and what it is?
[03:46.940 --> 03:51.000]  Well, we are a few days into Mario Party March at this point.
[03:51.020 --> 03:51.740]  When does this come out?
[03:51.740 --> 03:52.480]  Like the third?
[03:53.060 --> 03:53.480]  The fourth?
[03:54.220 --> 03:55.220]  That's almost there.
[03:55.740 --> 03:56.540]  Almost there.
[03:56.880 --> 03:56.900]  Fifth?
[03:57.260 --> 03:57.800]  The fifth!
[03:58.280 --> 03:59.000]  The fifth!
[03:59.280 --> 04:02.080]  So we're five days in to this Mario Party March game.
[04:02.280 --> 04:03.840]  We're about to go into a heated battle.
[04:04.020 --> 04:08.200]  But before things get heated, I wanted to cool things out.
[04:08.260 --> 04:11.880]  I wanted to send a peace offering to Gavin and Jeff.
[04:11.940 --> 04:13.860]  And I would have sent one to Nick, but I don't know where he lives.
[04:13.900 --> 04:14.600]  So I couldn't do it.
[04:14.900 --> 04:15.640]  I couldn't send it.
[04:17.260 --> 04:19.960]  Maybe we should change his new name to Nick Mysterio.
[04:20.180 --> 04:21.140]  Nick Mysterious.
[04:21.140 --> 04:24.140]  Jeff, have you revealed what was in your bag?
[04:24.880 --> 04:28.420]  I'm eating a chocolate Dilly Bar.
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.140]  That's right, a Dilly Bar from the Dilkong.
[04:31.520 --> 04:33.440]  A peace offering from the Dilkong.
[04:33.680 --> 04:35.420]  Little Dilly Bar for you guys.
[04:35.700 --> 04:36.180]  Hey, Andrew.
[04:36.280 --> 04:36.820]  Before we initiate.
[04:37.400 --> 04:38.020]  Can I tell you something?
[04:38.360 --> 04:38.680]  Uh-huh.
[04:39.140 --> 04:40.160]  It's delicious.
[04:40.680 --> 04:43.360]  Oh, that's what I want to hear is the Dilkong.
[04:43.900 --> 04:49.040]  So just remember, these first few turns, you know, maybe you land on a boo.
[04:49.040 --> 04:51.680]  Maybe you have the opportunity to screw somebody.
[04:51.820 --> 04:54.340]  Don't forget, Dilkong was there for you before we started.
[04:55.840 --> 04:58.360]  Dilkong offering a peaceful Dilly Bar.
[04:58.780 --> 05:01.880]  Did you search Austin for Dil food?
[05:02.440 --> 05:06.320]  No, I just all I could think of because I'm familiar with the Dairy Queen menu.
[05:06.680 --> 05:09.220]  All I did was search if you both had a Dairy Queen that would serve.
[05:10.120 --> 05:13.720]  Let me tell you guys, when I think Dairy Queen, I'm locked in on that menu.
[05:13.860 --> 05:15.980]  I'm familiar with the Dairy Queen menu, thank you.
[05:16.660 --> 05:16.960]  I am.
[05:17.500 --> 05:19.300]  Could have said it's Giant Dil Pickles.
[05:19.860 --> 05:21.720]  Yeah, but Dilly I think is funnier.
[05:21.900 --> 05:23.300]  I appreciate the ice cream, thank you.
[05:23.300 --> 05:24.500]  I just sent you my address.
[05:25.240 --> 05:27.080]  Send it to me, Nick, and then I'll send you a Dilly Bar.
[05:28.340 --> 05:28.720]  All right.
[05:29.120 --> 05:29.500]  Good to know.
[05:29.680 --> 05:30.500]  I'll do that after the show.
[05:31.200 --> 05:31.580]  I got you.
[05:31.640 --> 05:31.900]  Thank you.
[05:32.060 --> 05:32.640]  All right.
[05:32.880 --> 05:35.200]  So is that, is bribery allowed?
[05:35.560 --> 05:36.180]  Are we accepting that?
[05:36.500 --> 05:38.260]  Well, if it's fucking...
[05:38.260 --> 05:38.400]  Up to you.
[05:39.200 --> 05:40.520]  Are we putting a rule down now?
[05:41.300 --> 05:43.360]  Uh, I mean, if so, I think I cleared it.
[05:43.620 --> 05:45.120]  I think we should be open to it.
[05:45.360 --> 05:46.720]  I have accepted it into my tummy.
[05:46.720 --> 05:51.540]  I think bribery, once the game is in play, is off limits.
[05:51.780 --> 06:00.160]  See, I disagree with that because I think bribery day to day is such an exciting element.
[06:00.500 --> 06:05.580]  When you are four days in and you see alliances starting to form and you're like,
[06:05.660 --> 06:06.560]  Oh, I understand.
[06:06.700 --> 06:07.840]  I got to get Nick on my side.
[06:08.620 --> 06:14.340]  My issue, Eric, is that the stronghold chest is not equal amongst all parties.
[06:14.340 --> 06:19.380]  I would be a fool to put bribery into play.
[06:20.060 --> 06:21.180]  Well, you never know.
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.300]  We'll see what happens on day 22 when Gavin introduces the bribery wheel.
[06:26.620 --> 06:27.900]  Oh my god.
[06:28.480 --> 06:29.800]  What are we eating, Gavin?
[06:31.140 --> 06:31.600]  Corn.
[06:31.900 --> 06:34.940]  I'm trying to think of who would I want to make an alliance with the most.
[06:35.160 --> 06:38.700]  If you're going to try to bribe us with corn, you're in...
[06:40.400 --> 06:41.700]  Americans love corn.
[06:41.800 --> 06:42.580]  Everything is corn.
[06:43.040 --> 06:43.600]  It is true.
[06:43.600 --> 06:44.620]  Everything is corn.
[06:45.240 --> 06:47.780]  We do like corn, but because it's plentiful, not because it's sought after.
[06:48.180 --> 06:49.060]  Or good.
[06:51.120 --> 06:52.340]  I have a clip.
[06:53.060 --> 06:53.940]  Go for it.
[06:54.360 --> 06:55.280]  A very exciting clip.
[06:55.420 --> 06:56.740]  I've got a... this is very funny.
[06:57.340 --> 07:01.500]  So as we talked about last episode, we have...
[07:01.500 --> 07:05.600]  The Pencil Judge is competing on this season of Survivor.
[07:05.900 --> 07:06.260]  Yes.
[07:06.700 --> 07:07.180]  It's insane.
[07:07.540 --> 07:10.620]  We have a connection to the show and when we discovered this,
[07:10.620 --> 07:15.980]  I immediately reached out to a friend who does a lot of reality TV coverage named Taryn.
[07:16.520 --> 07:17.340]  And they work for...
[07:17.340 --> 07:20.100]  Rob has a podcast, which is like this big reality TV network.
[07:20.480 --> 07:24.740]  So I immediately was like, this is crazy because he's a fan of the show and he listens.
[07:25.880 --> 07:27.920]  And I was breaking down the pencil thing to him.
[07:28.580 --> 07:35.300]  And they do a draft podcast at the start of every season in which they pick players.
[07:35.720 --> 07:36.660]  It's like a pool of six.
[07:36.740 --> 07:37.900]  It's like they do a fantasy draft.
[07:38.300 --> 07:39.560]  And then whoever wins, wins.
[07:39.560 --> 07:41.820]  It's very standard how it works.
[07:42.580 --> 07:44.740]  And he planned on...
[07:44.740 --> 07:49.540]  Because he thought there's no way that he would end up getting him based off of the pencil thing
[07:49.540 --> 07:50.800]  and just where he'd end up in the draft.
[07:50.960 --> 07:52.780]  But he ended up with the first overall pick.
[07:53.240 --> 07:54.480]  So he was very excited.
[07:54.880 --> 07:55.840]  He planned...
[07:55.840 --> 07:58.920]  Like he worked out in his head that he was going to make a bunch of references to the show
[07:58.920 --> 08:01.280]  and asking questions for whoever picked them.
[08:01.460 --> 08:04.580]  But then he got the first overall pick, got really excited,
[08:04.740 --> 08:08.280]  and then just picked him based off of the Pencil Judge thing,
[08:08.280 --> 08:14.040]  but didn't factor in that he would then have to justify why he took this guy first overall.
[08:14.540 --> 08:19.160]  And they started pressing and he did not necessarily have answers beyond the podcast thing.
[08:19.300 --> 08:20.420]  It was very funny.
[08:20.740 --> 08:24.220]  He kept making very pointed references to he's a big fan of his judgment.
[08:24.740 --> 08:28.040]  And anyone who's a fan of our show, which there are a lot of comments
[08:28.040 --> 08:31.640]  of that thing of pencil eating and references.
[08:31.800 --> 08:33.800]  I have a clip from that or the very end.
[08:33.900 --> 08:35.640]  They've kind of discussed all their points.
[08:35.640 --> 08:38.040]  And he really put himself in a tight spot.
[08:38.160 --> 08:41.100]  And he dropped the pencil eating reference to a group of people
[08:41.100 --> 08:45.460]  that have no point of reference for what he's talking about.
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.520]  And it was the most confusing thing to this group of people.
[08:49.640 --> 08:50.800]  And it brought me so much joy.
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.140]  So this is him referencing that he is a fan of the survivor player because of his pencil opinions.
[08:57.340 --> 08:58.120]  He's a big fan.
[08:58.300 --> 09:00.900]  I've been told that he is pro pencil eating.
[09:01.060 --> 09:02.880]  So that's that was enough for me.
[09:03.300 --> 09:03.900]  What does that mean?
[09:06.120 --> 09:07.280]  Like he eats pencils?
[09:08.000 --> 09:08.780]  No, not him.
[09:08.860 --> 09:11.860]  It's just, you know, you should follow through on things that you said you're going to do.
[09:11.920 --> 09:13.860]  That's that's what he feels is what I feel.
[09:16.880 --> 09:17.780]  Did I miss something?
[09:19.260 --> 09:20.560]  Yeah, we all get it, Chappelle.
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.800]  OK, I don't know why you're confused.
[09:23.280 --> 09:23.740]  All right.
[09:24.480 --> 09:27.120]  Shout out to Shaheen's mom who listens to the podcast.
[09:28.840 --> 09:30.500]  Hey, I just I wanted to share that.
[09:30.640 --> 09:31.800]  That brought me so much joy.
[09:32.260 --> 09:32.980]  Six people.
[09:33.160 --> 09:34.360]  There's videos for it.
[09:34.360 --> 09:34.900]  You can watch it.
[09:34.900 --> 09:38.300]  They're just blank that have no concept.
[09:38.460 --> 09:43.820]  I love the idea that he just deliberately died in front of five people to really face himself.
[09:43.980 --> 09:45.280]  He absolutely did.
[09:45.360 --> 09:47.680]  He ate so much shit just because it was funny.
[09:48.180 --> 09:48.920]  I reached out immediately.
[09:49.060 --> 09:50.220]  I was like, oh, I appreciate it so much.
[09:50.620 --> 09:52.640]  And they're like, he's he's into pencils.
[09:52.880 --> 09:54.780]  And he's like, no, not him.
[09:55.460 --> 10:01.960]  There needs to be a term or like a position of exaltation for someone who publicly faces
[10:01.960 --> 10:03.540]  themselves in such a way, you know?
[10:03.540 --> 10:04.120]  Oh, man.
[10:04.900 --> 10:06.460]  But yeah, I just wanted to share that.
[10:06.560 --> 10:07.800]  Check that out there.
[10:07.960 --> 10:09.340]  They do great reality coverage.
[10:09.340 --> 10:14.140]  And that video, especially just seeing the blank faces of six other people.
[10:14.300 --> 10:14.880]  It's so good.
[10:15.320 --> 10:15.820]  It's great.
[10:16.280 --> 10:17.660]  I'm taking a bite of this dilly.
[10:17.860 --> 10:18.340]  What's it called?
[10:18.700 --> 10:19.240]  Dilly bar.
[10:19.640 --> 10:20.780]  You're going to hate it, Gavin.
[10:20.900 --> 10:22.620]  It's on the wrapper in front of you.
[10:22.960 --> 10:23.500]  No, it's good.
[10:23.760 --> 10:24.340]  No, it's delicious.
[10:24.820 --> 10:27.880]  It's maybe the most inefficient shape for a stick.
[10:28.500 --> 10:28.800]  What?
[10:29.180 --> 10:29.700]  What do you mean?
[10:30.340 --> 10:31.920]  Oh, it's round.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.400]  Oh, it's not bad.
[10:35.980 --> 10:37.080]  Oh, you don't mind it?
[10:37.360 --> 10:38.920]  I thought you'd be a lot pickier about the chocolate.
[10:40.380 --> 10:41.020]  It's fine.
[10:41.360 --> 10:41.740]  It's delicious.
[10:41.860 --> 10:42.820]  It's a pretty budget chocolate.
[10:43.160 --> 10:44.140]  One bite is enough for that one.
[10:46.020 --> 10:47.940]  It's like the one that Eric posted in the chat.
[10:48.040 --> 10:48.740]  That's Gavin's.
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.060]  I don't know if your bribe worked on Gavin, Andrew.
[10:53.580 --> 10:54.720]  Oh, I wouldn't expect it to.
[10:55.220 --> 10:55.600]  Worked on me?
[10:55.620 --> 11:00.020]  If I wanted to bribe Gavin, I'd send him like pickled fucking gopher feet or something.
[11:00.240 --> 11:01.120]  Something weird.
[11:01.120 --> 11:02.340]  You'd send him what?
[11:03.560 --> 11:04.800]  Pickled gopher feet?
[11:05.480 --> 11:06.900]  Yeah, it's a delicacy in the UK.
[11:07.960 --> 11:10.340]  My point was like a weird food.
[11:10.480 --> 11:12.960]  I don't really like anything pickled, apart from pickle.
[11:13.300 --> 11:15.400]  But you're a Branston pickle guy.
[11:15.800 --> 11:16.020]  Yeah.
[11:16.340 --> 11:16.900]  That's pickled.
[11:16.960 --> 11:17.520]  That's pickled.
[11:17.960 --> 11:18.560]  Is it not?
[11:18.800 --> 11:19.460]  It's in the name.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.520]  Is it really pickled, though, or is it pickle?
[11:21.840 --> 11:23.340]  Isn't it pickles that are pickled?
[11:24.500 --> 11:25.120]  As a spread?
[11:25.380 --> 11:26.060]  I think there's some pickle and onion pickled.
[11:26.300 --> 11:27.420]  There's some pickle pickle and...
[11:27.420 --> 11:27.660]  What?
[11:27.660 --> 11:28.260]  There's some...
[11:29.140 --> 11:30.700]  You don't like present tense pickle?
[11:30.880 --> 11:31.980]  Only past tense pickle?
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.040]  I think I just like the paste format.
[11:34.240 --> 11:37.660]  And when you have a pickle, it's not paste.
[11:37.980 --> 11:41.540]  I would actually maybe argue it's even more pickled than the average pickle because it's
[11:41.540 --> 11:42.820]  multiply multiple.
[11:43.480 --> 11:44.140]  No, I'm done.
[11:44.500 --> 11:45.380]  I lost that argument.
[11:45.600 --> 11:46.040]  Never mind.
[11:46.360 --> 11:47.280]  We're going home.
[11:48.760 --> 11:49.640]  That was bad.
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.340]  We just can't talk about this.
[11:51.740 --> 11:52.280]  No, we can't.
[11:52.300 --> 11:55.340]  I was going to say that there's multiple pickled items in one thing.
[11:55.720 --> 11:57.020]  Like it's only pickled items.
[11:57.060 --> 11:57.500]  Is it not?
[11:57.660 --> 12:00.860]  Yeah, I think it's like the cucumber and it's the onion.
[12:01.600 --> 12:03.960]  I think we read off the ingredients once.
[12:04.160 --> 12:05.020]  It's like a pickle sector.
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.820]  But the actual pickle paste is maybe 10 to 15 times better than a pickle cucumber.
[12:11.240 --> 12:13.740]  I think if you were to poll the audience and said like,
[12:13.820 --> 12:17.200]  one of these things is a lie about Gavin and they didn't have context
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.540]  and you listed he doesn't like pickled things, nobody's picking that.
[12:22.060 --> 12:26.420]  I think universally you're viewed as a pickled guy for the brands of pickle.
[12:26.540 --> 12:26.920]  I'm shocked.
[12:27.660 --> 12:31.420]  Hey, Andrew, despite your troubles with Gavin, just so we're clear.
[12:32.160 --> 12:35.280]  Before going into Mario Party March.
[12:35.560 --> 12:35.720]  Yep.
[12:36.020 --> 12:37.720]  Your bribe has worked on me.
[12:38.340 --> 12:43.900]  I will I am now in some form of debt to you in some way.
[12:43.900 --> 12:48.160]  And I will I will adhere to the constricts of a bribe.
[12:48.340 --> 12:51.040]  However, I will say as someone who is open to bribes,
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.300]  if anyone wants to bribe me on top of that to unbribe your bribe,
[12:56.300 --> 12:58.140]  I'm available.
[12:58.780 --> 13:01.200]  So I'm yours until somebody gives me a better deal.
[13:01.280 --> 13:01.680]  How about that?
[13:02.320 --> 13:03.440]  I'm OK with that.
[13:03.900 --> 13:07.480]  How about I'll give you the best gift you've ever had if you don't screw me through the game?
[13:07.740 --> 13:11.680]  I'm like a bird in the hands worth two in the bush kind of guy.
[13:12.400 --> 13:14.120]  Yeah, but what if there's five in the bush?
[13:14.760 --> 13:16.000]  I don't see I can't see.
[13:16.040 --> 13:17.040]  I don't send him a box.
[13:17.120 --> 13:18.820]  The bush doesn't exist to me, dude.
[13:19.440 --> 13:21.720]  Jeff, I'm going to take you for hot dogs and coffee.
[13:21.940 --> 13:23.300]  I like the sound of that.
[13:23.640 --> 13:24.560]  That's two in the bush.
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.100]  That's coffee and hot dogs in the bush.
[13:27.220 --> 13:27.940]  You haven't got them yet.
[13:28.160 --> 13:29.900]  I haven't done anything for him yet.
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.920]  But once he delivers on hot dogs and coffee, then we'll see.
[13:35.460 --> 13:35.860]  What if?
[13:36.080 --> 13:38.700]  Until as of right now, I'm Andrew's man right now.
[13:38.960 --> 13:39.980]  OK, what about this?
[13:40.420 --> 13:43.800]  If bribes are allowed throughout the game, are psych outs allowed?
[13:44.400 --> 13:44.640]  Yes.
[13:45.100 --> 13:46.940]  What are psych outs?
[13:47.060 --> 13:47.840]  What do you mean?
[13:48.400 --> 13:49.140]  Psych you out.
[13:49.560 --> 13:50.160]  What does that mean?
[13:52.160 --> 13:52.900]  I don't know.
[13:52.980 --> 13:53.740]  Hey, you know what?
[13:53.780 --> 13:54.440]  I think it's working.
[13:56.200 --> 13:57.540]  I'm on tilt right now, Gavin.
[13:57.620 --> 13:58.860]  Can you un-psych me, please?
[14:00.840 --> 14:02.240]  Game hasn't even started yet.
[14:02.300 --> 14:03.540]  I shouldn't be psyched out like this.
[14:03.720 --> 14:05.560]  That was such a do billboards work?
[14:05.660 --> 14:06.740]  They just did moment.
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.060]  Yeah, like maybe there's some, you know, real world things that can happen
[14:12.060 --> 14:14.340]  throughout the game to try and throw you a little bit.
[14:14.460 --> 14:16.140]  You're going to light my house on fire?
[14:16.280 --> 14:16.700]  What do you mean?
[14:17.140 --> 14:18.260]  Well, that's an escalation.
[14:18.760 --> 14:19.480]  It is.
[14:19.580 --> 14:20.720]  I mean, it would disrupt the game.
[14:21.440 --> 14:23.260]  Maybe there'll just be a game within the game that I'm playing.
[14:23.700 --> 14:27.840]  Maybe there'll be a marching band practicing outside of your bedroom window while we record.
[14:29.340 --> 14:30.780]  That'd be so hard to arrange.
[14:33.240 --> 14:37.660]  I'd open my door and say, hey, can you guys can you guys bring up a bed frame?
[14:38.020 --> 14:39.360]  I got a bed frame down here.
[14:39.740 --> 14:41.140]  There's like 16 of you.
[14:41.160 --> 14:41.980]  I think we could do this.
[14:42.460 --> 14:43.640]  Have you moved the bed frame yet?
[14:43.920 --> 14:45.240]  Not yet, but I've moved other things.
[14:45.320 --> 14:45.840]  Chair's gone.
[14:46.040 --> 14:46.880]  Got rid of all the chairs.
[14:47.280 --> 14:47.560]  Whoa.
[14:48.000 --> 14:48.400]  Wow.
[14:49.060 --> 14:49.940]  So you got some space again?
[14:50.480 --> 14:51.240]  I got some space.
[14:51.340 --> 14:52.120]  I'm reorganizing.
[14:52.120 --> 14:53.300]  You know what I realized?
[14:53.360 --> 14:55.200]  And I didn't plan on talking about this on the show,
[14:55.300 --> 15:00.780]  but it is so difficult to buy a travel bag for old consoles.
[15:01.560 --> 15:02.680]  It's just not accessible.
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.780]  You just can't get them anywhere.
[15:05.280 --> 15:05.520]  eBay.
[15:05.840 --> 15:06.860]  I looked at eBay.
[15:07.040 --> 15:08.140]  OK, here's that.
[15:08.200 --> 15:09.700]  That transitions to a different thing.
[15:09.880 --> 15:13.620]  I can't find them on eBay, but they're shipping.
[15:13.980 --> 15:15.800]  I looked at three bags.
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.560]  I was looking at an N64 one, a Wii U one and an original Xbox travel bag.
[15:22.580 --> 15:24.380]  Combined, it costs like $110.
[15:25.240 --> 15:26.940]  The shipping was $150.
[15:27.540 --> 15:28.440]  I was like, I can't do it.
[15:28.560 --> 15:29.080]  I just can't.
[15:29.380 --> 15:30.480]  I can't do it.
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.140]  Is it from outside of Canada?
[15:32.460 --> 15:34.400]  I think one of them was within Canada.
[15:34.460 --> 15:38.620]  But even within Canada, the shipping on eBay is very high, generally speaking.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.800]  But I had a thought where it's like,
[15:41.560 --> 15:43.320]  I'm not going to say that like this chain,
[15:43.340 --> 15:46.380]  I'm always going to be mad about shipping things.
[15:46.760 --> 15:48.380]  But I thought for the first time,
[15:48.380 --> 15:53.620]  the premise of what if I had to go to the item instead of the item doing the journey to me,
[15:53.700 --> 16:02.280]  the premise that I could go to like two different states for $150 worth of fuel.
[16:03.020 --> 16:03.500]  Insane.
[16:03.740 --> 16:04.500]  What a value.
[16:05.460 --> 16:08.220]  But it going the other way, way too much.
[16:08.700 --> 16:09.180]  Insane.
[16:09.400 --> 16:10.240]  How is that good value?
[16:10.800 --> 16:14.540]  You don't you think that you could like if you were to go on a road trip,
[16:14.960 --> 16:17.260]  you would spend more money on gas driving.
[16:17.260 --> 16:18.260]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[16:18.800 --> 16:21.400]  Like I'm saying the fuel, like if you had to make the trip,
[16:21.540 --> 16:27.480]  the actual cost of the transport for yourself is more than what the item is paying.
[16:27.800 --> 16:30.700]  And you have to go and do it and waste all of that time.
[16:30.960 --> 16:31.400]  That's true.
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.860]  Yeah, I'm not I'm not advocating.
[16:34.020 --> 16:37.200]  I know there's all just purely on the premise of travel, though.
[16:37.720 --> 16:38.700]  I just thought that was interesting.
[16:38.920 --> 16:44.820]  Like if somebody said, hey, here's tickets to this place in the United States for $50.
[16:44.820 --> 16:47.380]  I would that's a great value.
[16:47.460 --> 16:51.700]  But if I'm buying a $20 item attached to it and I'm paying 50 for the travel part,
[16:51.720 --> 16:53.140]  it's like this is the worst deal ever.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.680]  Why do you want to put all your consoles in bags?
[16:55.960 --> 17:01.380]  Because they're all in like grocery bags right now in my closet.
[17:01.380 --> 17:04.760]  And I was trying to like properly I'm trying to organize my closet better.
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.360]  And I thought I just having like a nice console bag would really solve these problems.
[17:09.640 --> 17:11.300]  So I thought I'll just buy a few.
[17:11.300 --> 17:16.020]  And it just it's not there's not like a company that just specializes in that from what I could
[17:16.020 --> 17:19.100]  see outside of whatever the current generation of console is.
[17:19.260 --> 17:22.760]  And it feels like a waste to buy one for a current gen console
[17:22.760 --> 17:24.680]  because then I just have an empty bag.
[17:24.700 --> 17:27.580]  But in like seven years, I guess it would be useful.
[17:27.580 --> 17:29.960]  But like, is that am I losing at that point?
[17:30.040 --> 17:32.160]  It feels like a waste to keep a console in a bag.
[17:32.540 --> 17:36.320]  Well, I just I don't have space to plug in some of the stuff like the N64.
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.920]  And I have an original Xbox that like.
[17:39.000 --> 17:40.440]  Couldn't you just put it on a shelf?
[17:40.440 --> 17:41.900]  Like build shelves?
[17:42.400 --> 17:42.660]  I don't.
[17:42.680 --> 17:43.020]  In your closet?
[17:44.580 --> 17:45.640]  What about the wall?
[17:46.440 --> 17:46.700]  Yeah.
[17:46.840 --> 17:47.220]  Oh, yeah.
[17:47.360 --> 17:47.660]  What do you mean?
[17:47.680 --> 17:48.140]  Put it on the wall.
[17:48.640 --> 17:49.580]  Put a console on the wall.
[17:50.260 --> 17:51.140]  How would I do that?
[17:51.720 --> 17:52.120]  Hang it.
[17:52.620 --> 17:52.940]  Screws?
[17:55.420 --> 17:57.580]  A little display wall of all your shit?
[17:58.100 --> 17:58.400]  Yeah.
[17:58.620 --> 17:59.060]  I don't.
[17:59.340 --> 18:01.340]  Remember back how like Jeremy had all of his Xbox
[18:02.280 --> 18:04.480]  one controllers on the wall or 360 controllers on the wall?
[18:04.560 --> 18:05.000]  Kind of like that.
[18:05.280 --> 18:05.980]  Yeah, I got some of those.
[18:06.240 --> 18:08.640]  Or like Gavin has his he doesn't talk about it, but his dildo wall.
[18:10.680 --> 18:12.140]  Oh, I've heard about the dildo wall.
[18:12.400 --> 18:12.600]  Yeah.
[18:13.540 --> 18:14.220]  Oh, what if it?
[18:14.320 --> 18:15.740]  Oh, would that would they be?
[18:15.800 --> 18:18.660]  Would they be slung on like a little hook or would they be poking through the wall?
[18:18.720 --> 18:20.840]  Like 18 glory holes with dildos coming out?
[18:20.860 --> 18:25.620]  Well, the ones at like a higher elevation are just set and nestled to like the side.
[18:25.700 --> 18:29.300]  But the ones that are lower that you feel like using, those are just protruded outwards.
[18:29.380 --> 18:33.300]  So it's just like kind of a grab and go situation or use it right there on the wall.
[18:34.440 --> 18:36.340]  Do you think dildos got bigger with time?
[18:37.420 --> 18:38.380]  Dildos got bigger with time?
[18:38.380 --> 18:40.280]  Like people got taller over time?
[18:40.440 --> 18:44.200]  No, like, do you think that like the expectation changed over time?
[18:44.620 --> 18:45.700]  Oh, like the first dildo.
[18:45.980 --> 18:48.140]  Like the first dildos were like kind of like modest.
[18:48.340 --> 18:49.900]  Yeah. And then as time progressed, like.
[18:50.040 --> 18:55.360]  I mean, you can go back and look at dildos they've dug up that are like 5,000 years old
[18:55.360 --> 18:56.260]  and see for yourself.
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.400]  There's some there's some there's some honkers out there from the olden days.
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.660]  I'd like to think that they're like noses or ears or they're progressively growing.
[19:05.220 --> 19:09.080]  I think a dildo culture is always slightly getting bigger.
[19:09.340 --> 19:11.860]  I don't know how they know it's a dildo though.
[19:12.300 --> 19:15.440]  Like, surely wouldn't stuff become dildo over time?
[19:18.220 --> 19:22.580]  Wouldn't a bunch of stuff eventually erode down to just like a cylinder of stone or something?
[19:23.420 --> 19:24.560]  And they're like, oh, it's a dildo.
[19:25.120 --> 19:30.080]  What if it was a rolling pin or like what if it was some sort of tool?
[19:30.300 --> 19:32.720]  Do you think people are incorrectly declaring dildos that aren't dildos?
[19:32.720 --> 19:36.080]  I think a lot of stuff looks like a dildo at the end.
[19:36.480 --> 19:38.340]  Really? Interesting.
[19:39.460 --> 19:42.820]  I'm trying to think of what, like, what do you think? Like a club?
[19:43.300 --> 19:45.380]  Oh, a chair leg or something? I don't know, like everything.
[19:47.580 --> 19:49.420]  Like, how do your collection?
[19:49.940 --> 19:51.380]  Your collection is fucking weird, dude.
[19:51.780 --> 19:55.900]  Yeah, my point is, how do they know something from 5,000 years ago was a dildo originally?
[19:55.980 --> 19:59.880]  Evan must think that I have so many dildos left over from these chairs that I'm breaking.
[19:59.880 --> 20:00.540]  DNA?
[20:02.080 --> 20:03.000]  DNA on it.
[20:03.580 --> 20:04.980]  DNA on the dildo.
[20:06.120 --> 20:07.300]  How do they know, Jeff?
[20:07.560 --> 20:10.720]  Do you think it's called a dildo because the inventor was named dildo?
[20:10.800 --> 20:13.600]  That feels like a name. I've never thought about this.
[20:13.680 --> 20:15.820]  I think because of images like this.
[20:17.060 --> 20:22.000]  An old fresco where somebody's holding a dildo in their hand and they're taking it out of a bag,
[20:22.160 --> 20:23.540]  a box full of dildos.
[20:23.820 --> 20:25.060]  No, no, no.
[20:25.240 --> 20:27.320]  You wouldn't store them like that, right, Gavin?
[20:27.320 --> 20:31.220]  Once again though, once again you're saying it's a bucket of dildos.
[20:31.560 --> 20:36.240]  Or how about this old dildo that they found that looks like somebody carved it with a
[20:36.240 --> 20:37.300]  dickhead at the end of it?
[20:37.360 --> 20:39.520]  That could be like a pestle and mortar situation.
[20:39.600 --> 20:40.900]  These are scientists!
[20:41.560 --> 20:45.320]  I wasn't on Gavin's side. I think the second one does look like a chair leg.
[20:45.640 --> 20:49.580]  And the first one could simply be a man holding a candle,
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.660]  trying to figure out what's in his fruit basket.
[20:52.660 --> 20:55.600]  It's a man stepping into his shoehorn bucket,
[20:55.600 --> 20:58.320]  because that's where he puts on his shoes and he's using his shoehorns.
[20:58.540 --> 21:03.060]  Our knowledge of dildos isn't just limited to amusing archaeological finds.
[21:03.240 --> 21:07.200]  We even see evidence of dildos in a range of art and literature from the ancient world,
[21:07.380 --> 21:08.560]  like the Bible.
[21:10.500 --> 21:11.960]  There's a chapter on dildos?
[21:12.080 --> 21:14.180]  They described the dimensions of a dildo?
[21:14.380 --> 21:19.120]  However, the first literary appearance of the dildo may well outdate even ancient Greece.
[21:19.280 --> 21:22.780]  In fact, the first literary reference to dildos is believed to take place in the Old Testament,
[21:22.780 --> 21:24.280]  in Ezekiel 16-17.
[21:24.880 --> 21:28.640]  God reprimands the people of Jerusalem because they took the gold and silver
[21:28.640 --> 21:32.320]  that he has given them and made phallic images and fornicated with them.
[21:35.100 --> 21:42.060]  According to a video by Dan McClellan, theologian and scripture translator,
[21:42.200 --> 21:45.520]  the original verb used to describe fornification is zanah,
[21:45.880 --> 21:50.320]  which is often used as a metaphorical sense in the Hebrew Bible to refer to
[21:50.320 --> 21:56.200]  worshipping other deities symbolically committing adultery against God in Israel.
[21:57.340 --> 22:01.520]  So while it could be seen as metaphorical fornication with phallic images,
[22:01.640 --> 22:06.220]  he states that it is also very plausible that this could and should be interpreted literally.
[22:06.800 --> 22:09.200]  I definitely don't doubt that dildos were around,
[22:09.280 --> 22:11.740]  that it was one of the first things invented probably by man,
[22:11.940 --> 22:15.860]  but I'm just not sure how they know the physical objects are the dildos.
[22:15.960 --> 22:19.720]  Well, how do you know a bowl is a bowl and not a shit container?
[22:20.380 --> 22:21.760]  Exactly my point. Yeah.
[22:24.420 --> 22:26.040]  What's the oldest dildo you have, Gavin?
[22:28.080 --> 22:29.220]  It's the one at the top of the wall.
[22:30.620 --> 22:32.480]  You climb it like it's a romper room.
[22:35.460 --> 22:39.660]  Like, like your cliffhanger, you're shoving dildos into the wall to go higher.
[22:41.680 --> 22:45.520]  We talked about that clip, haven't we, where the guy throws the dildo and it like goes down that
[22:46.100 --> 22:46.780]  guy's throat.
[22:47.480 --> 22:51.940]  No, dude, I just caught a passage. I was about to close the dildo page.
[22:52.600 --> 22:57.240]  Hallie Lieberman's research indicates that double-ended dildos have a history that extends
[22:57.240 --> 23:04.720]  back at least 13,000 to 19,000 years. Hey, that's crazy. People were freaks back then. I love it.

[23:44.920 --> 23:52.520]  something to share. A wonderful creation. I don't know if you guys have seen, ever since we talked
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.480]  about the GERPLID, people have been going out there and making their own solutions to the problem.
[23:58.400 --> 24:04.220]  And I got sent one today by a member of our community named Matthew Frank, and I really
[24:04.220 --> 24:11.280]  appreciate his ingenuity. I'm posting a video clip in our Discord channel right now. Gavin,
[24:11.280 --> 24:19.640]  I think you'll especially appreciate this design. Okay. It is uploading. It's almost done. So as
[24:19.640 --> 24:25.960]  you can see, it is a GERPLID with a blue top on it and it has a pair of balls. What? On the top.
[24:26.440 --> 24:32.800]  What? And a shaft. This is insane. Now, how do you know they're balls? That's a great point, Jeff.
[24:33.360 --> 24:39.480]  Now, see, he's explaining how it works. So you can knuckle the balls. He calls it the unregulation
[24:39.480 --> 24:46.000]  knuckler. You knuckle them and it closes the little gap. So if you want to stop some drippage.
[24:46.420 --> 24:54.420]  Wow. You got it taken care of. That is brilliant. Yeah, I was blown away by the design.
[24:55.820 --> 25:00.300]  Thank you very much to them. I've loved seeing all these people's creations. They're great. I'm so
[25:00.300 --> 25:03.160]  glad you brought that up because I was going to talk about a few as well. There's the guy that
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.060]  made the GERPLID silencer, which has got the rubber bands around it. So if it falls, it's quiet.
[25:09.060 --> 25:13.960]  There's all the people that are saying that you can like apparently large McDonald's lids fit
[25:13.960 --> 25:18.620]  very well on a GERPLID. They're saying, yeah, apparently they work really well. There's been
[25:18.620 --> 25:23.940]  a bunch of like GERPLID accoutrements over since the last episode that have been really fantastic
[25:23.940 --> 25:28.700]  to watch and find out about. This is by far the best. Would you drink out of that, Gavin?
[25:30.560 --> 25:34.600]  Well, I don't know. I don't know if like 3D print is safe to put your mouth on,
[25:34.680 --> 25:38.620]  but if it was done properly, I would definitely drink out of that. Interesting. I never thought
[25:38.620 --> 25:44.220]  about the 3D printing safety thing. I assume it's not food safe, but as a concept, incredible.
[25:44.660 --> 25:49.800]  He would much rather blindly trust the plastic or silicone mold that comes from a
[25:49.800 --> 25:57.520]  factory that none of us will ever go to. You want to get gross, Jeff? I want to make sure you have
[25:57.520 --> 26:01.380]  tons of time. I feel good now. I feel ready. I'm locked in. Oh, yeah, I'm down to get gross. But
[26:01.380 --> 26:05.200]  Gavin, you had a clip too. You said we started late because of your clip. Did you want to do that?
[26:05.200 --> 26:10.780]  Uh, well, yeah, I could play the clip for sure. I'd hope so. Well, let somebody know if you wouldn't
[26:10.780 --> 26:16.140]  mind. We'd appreciate it. And we'll be here next week saying the same dumb shit. I imagine Gavin's
[26:16.140 --> 26:21.060]  balls will come up at some point. So you don't want to miss that. Got some ball news. Oh, no.
[26:22.580 --> 26:27.940]  Now, this is a superpower that I've discovered I have now ever since. Oh, no. At some point last
[26:27.940 --> 26:33.960]  year, I had an MRI on my brain and they ejected some... it wasn't an MRI. It was like a CT
[26:33.960 --> 26:40.840]  something. They had to inject some contrast into my brain so they could see the veins in it,
[26:40.900 --> 26:45.840]  I guess. That's crazy. And as they were injecting it, the woman said,
[26:46.520 --> 26:53.660]  uh, you might, you might feel some, some heat in your cheeks and your hands. All right. And, uh,
[26:53.660 --> 27:00.340]  she, she put the needle in and gave it a squeeze. Straight into my balls. I felt the heat immediately
[27:00.340 --> 27:06.420]  as she plunged it in my testicles. And ever since that, I have a new superpower where
[27:07.140 --> 27:14.220]  temperature is detected in my balls. Like second, like if Meg has cold hands and she touches my arm,
[27:14.420 --> 27:22.420]  my balls go cold. And I don't know why or like what the science of that is, but I can feel
[27:22.420 --> 27:29.480]  like if, if I was trying to test like baby milk temperature, I think I would have to squirt it
[27:29.480 --> 27:37.280]  on my balls. Or I would feel it in my balls. Or if I was like elbowing the bathtub. I don't know
[27:37.280 --> 27:45.900]  how it happened, but there's now a link between my arms and my balls. Can we scientifically test
[27:45.900 --> 27:52.340]  this? Can we get together and do some filming, please? I think it's time. We, you, you don't
[27:52.340 --> 27:58.180]  like, you could be fully covered yet. We just need something that like detects heat in a specific
[27:58.180 --> 28:04.420]  region. And we have to like, have you feel ice. I want to see it. Maybe if we did temperature
[28:04.420 --> 28:08.760]  probes on the sack, I want to see if my balls are actually getting cold or whether it's just a
[28:08.760 --> 28:15.940]  phantom feeling. But I felt it in my hands and my cheeks, maybe 30 seconds after. And I felt it in
[28:15.940 --> 28:21.980]  my balls, maybe one second after she ejected it. It was crazy. If Meg has cold hands, you get warm
[28:21.980 --> 28:28.320]  balls. Does it work the other way? If something touches you, that's really hot. Do your balls
[28:28.320 --> 28:33.260]  get cold? Like, is it a... No, I felt the cold in my balls when she touched my head. Do you feel
[28:33.260 --> 28:38.320]  the heat in your balls when you touch something hot, like the stove? I don't know. She kind of
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.580]  touched the back of my arm, like under, like I'd say in a bicep area. And I felt it. So maybe I
[28:43.580 --> 28:48.460]  should put something hot there. Well, let's don't do it till we can film it. Okay. I was just
[28:48.460 --> 28:53.320]  wondering, did anyone else, has anyone else had any, like, ball-to-rest-of-the-body links that
[28:53.320 --> 29:00.180]  they didn't know were there? For heat? No. Okay. That's so interesting, though. Nick specifically
[29:00.180 --> 29:05.760]  said not for temperature. What have you felt? Uh, my balls? His balls know when it's gonna rain.
[29:06.240 --> 29:08.920]  Yeah. A ball-rometer?
[29:08.920 --> 29:10.340]  A ball-rometer.
[29:13.320 --> 29:19.940]  Raised themselves into the body. Yeah. Here comes the storm. So you feel a cold thing and your balls
[29:19.940 --> 29:26.200]  let you know before anything else does? Am I understanding this correctly? No, I mean,
[29:26.260 --> 29:30.760]  I feel it in my balls next. Like, I feel it in the original spot. It's the point of contact,
[29:30.760 --> 29:36.940]  and then it goes, you get like a shiver in your balls. Yeah. But it's so fast. It's like the,
[29:36.940 --> 29:43.160]  it's like maybe after one second. It's like spider-sense. I can't tell whether it's like
[29:43.160 --> 29:48.840]  the speed of the nerves or whether the cold is getting into my blood and then my blood gets
[29:48.840 --> 29:54.000]  pumped and I feel it when it hits my balls. But I don't know if blood is that fast. Now, did you
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.420]  ever notice it in your balls before? Ever? Like, just generally? No. Because I don't feel like
[29:59.420 --> 30:05.900]  I'm detecting heat or cold from my balls just in a general sense. If you, maybe if we got an ice
[30:05.900 --> 30:10.840]  cube and put it on my arm, that would be a good test. Yeah, this sounds like something to test
[30:10.840 --> 30:16.100]  in the next office day. Well, we should, I mean, I'm just kind of spitballing here. Feel free to
[30:16.100 --> 30:22.640]  kind of lead me down the right path. We put the ice cube on your arm and see how soon until you
[30:22.640 --> 30:26.800]  feel it in your balls. And then we let everything kind of like re-warm. And then we put the ice
[30:26.800 --> 30:33.100]  cube on your balls and see if it was faster or slower. Yeah. You think touching it on my arm
[30:33.100 --> 30:38.580]  will be faster than touching on my balls? Gavin, I have no idea how your superpowers work. I'm
[30:38.580 --> 30:41.980]  trying to get to the bottom of this. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. This is what's called the scientific
[30:41.980 --> 30:47.180]  process, Gavin. You gotta let it play out. We're scientists. Well, here's how I think we could do
[30:47.180 --> 30:52.320]  it. We'll all get together on an office day and we'll all have a stopwatch. We all put the ice
[30:52.320 --> 30:58.160]  cube on our arms and then you just stop the timer when you feel it in your balls. If ever. I love
[30:58.160 --> 31:02.260]  that. All right. I think that's one of the many cool experiments we're about to do on your balls.
[31:02.260 --> 31:08.840]  Yeah. And that is the end of my weekly bull news. Just very quickly, as we were talking about,
[31:09.060 --> 31:14.760]  and we're in the process of looking for an office, I'm going to share this and I don't
[31:14.760 --> 31:19.980]  want you guys to reveal what it is, but I found something that I think we should all
[31:20.860 --> 31:24.860]  come together for. I think we could all agree that we should put our own money towards this
[31:25.420 --> 31:31.500]  for the office. Look at this. I just didn't. We can reveal at a later point what this is.
[31:31.500 --> 31:43.660]  Look at what I found is available. No way. No way. No way. Edit that. I can't say. No. That
[31:43.660 --> 31:48.360]  was the whole thing you just said. Yep. That was the whole point. Without saying what it was.
[31:49.200 --> 31:55.200]  You're going to just reveal it. Okay. I can't believe this is real. I cannot believe it was
[31:55.200 --> 32:00.360]  real either. We need it. We should definitely get that. Oh dude, there's like a bunch of stuff.
[32:00.360 --> 32:05.420]  There's a few. Yeah, that's by far the best thing, but we need that.
[32:07.300 --> 32:10.980]  We can put Gavin's cold balls in it or something. I don't know, but we need it.
[32:12.260 --> 32:16.680]  No way. Isn't that crazy? There's a bunch of stuff. Yeah, I was really excited about it,
[32:16.780 --> 32:22.120]  but that is the coolest thing. It's also kind of affordable too, you know? Yeah, I know. It's
[32:22.120 --> 32:27.000]  not insane. Absolutely. I bet if it goes for its lowest, you could even make profit just
[32:27.000 --> 32:34.280]  with the materials. Potentially. We'll reveal this at a later date of what this item was.
[32:34.580 --> 32:40.660]  And Gavin, you'll be the first to use it, right? I guess so. It's so funny that you had your ball
[32:41.340 --> 32:46.280]  update, and I realized looking at my notes, I have a small ball update too. Oh please, Geoff. Do you
[32:46.280 --> 32:52.960]  think we should dedicate a little segment every month to ball news? Maybe. Maybe not a bad idea.
[32:53.320 --> 32:56.420]  Ball news. I did something last night that I've never done before,
[32:58.040 --> 33:03.860]  and while my wife was laughing at me about it, I thought, I wonder if you guys have ever
[33:03.860 --> 33:07.880]  experienced this, or if it's just me, or if it's an age thing, or maybe I'm just incredibly limber.
[33:07.960 --> 33:11.940]  Maybe that's what it is. Maybe I'm just too flexible. But last night when I was putting
[33:11.940 --> 33:17.440]  my pajama pants on, putting my legs into my pajama pants, I had taken my pants off and then put my
[33:17.440 --> 33:23.800]  pajama pants on, I somehow flamingo kicked my own balls with my right heel of my foot and almost
[33:23.800 --> 33:32.020]  blacked out. Standing up, standing up, like pulling my pants off, I like slipped and my leg just went
[33:32.020 --> 33:39.140]  straight up and the heel of my right foot just smashed my right ball so hard I saw black. Like
[33:39.140 --> 33:46.900]  I lost my vision for a second. And I don't know if that means I'm in really good shape and really
[33:46.900 --> 33:53.160]  limber, or if my balls are hanging down to my knees or whatever, but holy shit, I've never kicked my
[33:53.160 --> 33:59.040]  own balls before. Have you guys ever kicked yourself in the balls? Was it the back of your balls?
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.540]  Or the underside? No, it was like the bottom, it was like the whole right ball. I kicked the
[34:03.540 --> 34:08.860]  fucking whole, the whole ball, man. My heel is as big of a ball, bigger than my ball, man. Just smushed it
[34:08.860 --> 34:14.620]  right up into me. I don't, I've never had that happen, and I've never heard of anyone kicking
[34:14.620 --> 34:21.280]  themselves in the balls before. Yeah, I've never heard someone kick themselves in the nuts. Talk about a fucking superpower you wish you didn't have.
[34:22.760 --> 34:29.560]  Why, why can people do that? What a stupid evolution. I don't recommend they, they try to find out if it's
[34:29.560 --> 34:34.340]  something that they can or can't do. Just assume you can't and move along with your life and try to
[34:34.340 --> 34:38.860]  just be very careful, just be very careful putting jammy pants on apparently. I feel like I've nudged
[34:38.860 --> 34:44.000]  my balls with the heel, like if I sit cross-legged too fast, but I've never done it from like a stand.
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.220]  Jeff, when did you get these jammy pants? How new are these jammy pants? I got them for Christmas.
[34:50.820 --> 34:56.280]  Okay. They're Detroit Tigers jammies that Bernie and Vanessa got me. I just feel like every story I
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.740]  hear relating to your jammy pants is disaster for you, and I was questioning if you needed to get rid of the jammy pants.
[35:01.860 --> 35:07.740]  If I'm in jammies, it's not good. It's a bad scene. It's the bad time of day for me, the, the, the sleep.
[35:07.980 --> 35:13.160]  You're knocking over sodas, you're kicking your own balls, like these jammy pants, I, I think you
[35:13.160 --> 35:20.060]  gotta evaluate. Midnight to about 5am is a dark time for me in a lot of ways. Dude, people were
[35:20.060 --> 35:25.980]  floored that you're drinking soda at night. I'm not! I'm not drinking soda at night! No, you said it was there from the morning.
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.040]  I had a monster energy drink at eight in the fucking morning that I had drank five sips of,
[35:31.060 --> 35:35.900]  and I sat it down, and then I went about my entire day, forgot that it even existed, and then at two
[35:35.900 --> 35:40.040]  in the morning or whatever, when I get up to pee, I walked by it, and I saw liquid, and I thought, oh,
[35:40.040 --> 35:44.680]  my mouth is dry. I'll just take a sip of that. It's not like I was gonna drink enough to get a
[35:44.680 --> 35:49.820]  fucking, to wake, zoom, I'm awake! I had one ounce of fucking caffeine, now I'm bouncing off the walls.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.400]  It was nothing like that, and it was, it was a sugar-free one too, by the way. It wasn't a
[35:53.400 --> 36:00.620]  sugary drink. It was just something to wet my mouth. That's fair. Yeah. I don't keep, I don't even keep
[36:00.620 --> 36:04.980]  drinks by, it was, that's what the thing that was crazy is that I had a drink by my bed three out
[36:04.980 --> 36:10.240]  of four nights. That never happens. I don't ever have that. Emily keeps what she calls her baba
[36:10.240 --> 36:18.020]  by her bed, which is like an 864 ounce Stanley cup with like a backpack on it, and a fucking,
[36:18.500 --> 36:22.640]  I don't know, like a docking station, and all the different things that you can put on one of those
[36:22.640 --> 36:27.920]  drinks. It's got like fucking, it's got wi-fi and bluetooth, and if I ever get thirsty at night,
[36:27.960 --> 36:30.720]  I usually just say like, can I have a drink of your baba, and then she'll let me drink it. But
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.420]  it just so rarely happens, and she was dead ass asleep all three times, so I didn't bother.
[36:35.380 --> 36:38.700]  Oh, that's so funny. You describe it like she's wearing a camelback to bed,
[36:38.780 --> 36:45.000]  just in case, like the immediate drinkage. I actually try not to drink past like 9 or 10
[36:45.000 --> 36:48.380]  p.m. in general, whether it's water or anything else, because I don't want to be up pissing all
[36:48.380 --> 36:53.100]  night. It's just like, same. If I'm going to be up till 2 in the morning playing with the truck
[36:53.100 --> 36:56.480]  boys, maybe I'll bring a drink into it, like I was going to do that one night. But yeah,
[36:56.580 --> 37:00.880]  it's, I'm not drinking monsters every night at 3 in the morning. God damn. Did you, when you healed
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.460]  your balls, Jeff, did you notice any drippage? No, no, they were tight. Tight and dry. Yeah,
[37:06.640 --> 37:09.380]  no drippage. I bet if you just pissed there, there might have been a jet.
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.640]  Oh, 100%. If I had just pissed, there would have been. And speaking of piss, this is a great
[37:15.640 --> 37:21.400]  opportunity for me to catch you guys up on where I've been in my life, what's been going on in my
[37:21.400 --> 37:29.620]  deal. Please. Over the weekend, I went down to, Emily, Burndog, and Vanessa and I, we all went
[37:29.620 --> 37:34.860]  down to Disneyland to celebrate Vanessa's birthday and Emily's birthday. And so we were there from
[37:34.860 --> 37:42.460]  Thursday to Sunday, had a lovely time. On Friday, Emily, we just did a thing, you know, because none
[37:42.460 --> 37:46.060]  of us drink or anything, right? So not that you could in Disneyland anyway, but I guess you could
[37:46.060 --> 37:50.860]  at California Adventure. But you know, none of us are like partiers, right? So we're walking around
[37:50.860 --> 37:54.280]  Disneyland, you want to treat yourself, you're like, oh, they have cotton candy. And so Emily
[37:54.280 --> 37:57.560]  was like a kid and going like, oh, I want to get a little bit of this or I want a little bit of
[37:57.560 --> 38:01.920]  that, you know, a little bit, I want to have some of that. And on Friday, we had ate a lot of just dog
[38:01.920 --> 38:06.020]  shit by the end of the day. And I was like, man, I got to take it easy tomorrow. At about two in
[38:06.020 --> 38:13.540]  the morning that night, Emily woke up and proceeded to vomit more than I've ever, and I say this
[38:13.540 --> 38:17.960]  without hyperbole, more than I've ever heard a human being vomit in my entire life. Like she
[38:17.960 --> 38:24.020]  could have filled up like four of the buckets in the Bozo the Clown ping pong bucket challenge.
[38:24.020 --> 38:28.540]  Like it was insane. And I helped her get cleaned up and everything. And she was fine. She's had a
[38:28.540 --> 38:33.120]  sick tummy from probably riding rides and eating all the candy. And so she went back to bed. Totally
[38:33.120 --> 38:39.760]  fine. Totally fine. Get up the next day. I look at Emily as a cautionary tale, because burndog
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.720]  cannot say no to food. So we walk by and he's like, oh, cuties. I'll take a cutie. And then
[38:43.720 --> 38:48.400]  he like buys oranges, bananas, but it's not that too. It's like churros. And it's like, oh, I'll
[38:48.400 --> 38:53.680]  take two churros. Turkey leg. I'll take a turkey leg. Fucking Star Wars tippy up. I'll take some of
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.040]  that gross ass chicken, like whatever it is. And to where we're just like walking from like, I'll
[38:58.040 --> 39:03.260]  take a coffee. I'll take a cold brew. I'll take a fucking soda. I'll take I'll take some water.
[39:03.420 --> 39:08.260]  I'll take churros. I'll take an ice cream sandwich. And it's just constantly all Saturday.
[39:08.260 --> 39:12.000]  And I'm having like a bite of most stuff, but I'm trying to take it easy because I don't want to end
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.460]  up like Emily. And I'm doing great and having a wonderful time, really enjoying Disneyland.
[39:17.460 --> 39:23.920]  Or at this point, it was California Adventure for me on Saturday. And I have learned through that
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.200]  other stupid podcast I did for a while with Jack that I no longer can ride roller coasters. I've
[39:28.200 --> 39:33.800]  developed nausea. I never had it. I never I was I was a brave little boy for most of my life.
[39:33.860 --> 39:39.240]  But somewhere in my 40s, I got scared of heights and roller coasters. And so I was good. I went
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.960]  on everything, got to the Incredicoaster, said, fuck it. I've been on it before. It made me nauseous,
[39:43.960 --> 39:48.260]  but I'm going to do it. I'm in the I'm in the right frame of mind. And I got on that Incredicoaster.
[39:48.360 --> 39:53.660]  I was doing great. And then we get to that one stupid loop, the upside down part that wrecked
[39:53.660 --> 39:59.220]  me, dude. It fucking wrecked me for the next hour. I was brutally nauseous. And so I just had to like
[39:59.220 --> 40:04.760]  sit down by and just like sip on some water for a while till I recovered. That was fine for the rest
[40:04.760 --> 40:10.340]  of the day. Have a great time. We're hanging out. We part our version of party. We're playing Uno
[40:10.340 --> 40:18.080]  or whatever and go to bed. Happy as a clam at two in the morning out of the blue, I wake up
[40:20.100 --> 40:24.920]  nauseous. And I'm like, that is strange. I don't ever wake up nauseous in the middle of the night.
[40:25.100 --> 40:30.960]  And I and I don't really get nauseous often, like in a real way. I very rarely
[40:32.400 --> 40:36.100]  suffer nausea. And I'm like, oh, maybe it'll go away. So I lay there for a little minute and I
[40:36.100 --> 40:39.920]  realize it's not going to go away. I get up and I go into the bathroom. And of course, it's a strange
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.020]  bathroom at a Westin hotel where all the lights are off. You know, I don't know where anything is.
[40:44.080 --> 40:49.840]  I'm fumbling around and I sit down on the toilet and I'm just like, maybe if I can just sit here
[40:49.840 --> 40:58.760]  and write it out. And then as I do that, sitting on the toilet activates the diarrhea. I immediately
[40:58.760 --> 41:09.060]  start explosive diarrhea. The diarrhea initiates the vomit. I look around because I realize that
[41:09.060 --> 41:14.400]  my ass is tied to the toilet. There's a trash can. I grab the trash can. I like reach over and
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.800]  I grab it and it's the fucking heaviest. It's like made out of concrete. It's so heavy. I can't lift
[41:19.800 --> 41:24.560]  it to hold it. And I'm like, I'm like struggling to hold it up to throw into it. And I put it back
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.440]  on the ground and I can't like aim the puke at it. So I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.660]  So I just like I hold the puke in my mouth long enough until I stop shitting for just a second.
[41:33.660 --> 41:39.520]  Then I jump up and I spin around and I throw up into the toilet, which gets all over the front
[41:39.520 --> 41:47.160]  of the toilet. And then I have to, and I'm just like, not as much as Emily, but a lot. And I'm
[41:47.160 --> 41:51.000]  like, Oh my God. Oh my God. And then as soon as it stops, I got to spin back around and slam down
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.220]  and diarrhea out the diarrhea and then spin around and throw up. And I do that like three times until
[41:56.220 --> 42:01.340]  it's all gone. And I'm just sweating. You know how you're like sweating, like you've run a marathon
[42:01.340 --> 42:07.360]  and you're clammy and you're exhausted and you're shaking from all of that, from that whole 45
[42:07.360 --> 42:13.500]  second ordeal. And it was maybe the worst 45 seconds of my life. And I like, I do the thing
[42:13.500 --> 42:17.900]  that I do every night. Now I get on the ground and I start cleaning up mess that I've made.
[42:17.960 --> 42:22.680]  And I'm just like clean. I get a towel and a washcloth and of course Emily's sleeping. She
[42:22.680 --> 42:26.140]  doesn't know any of this is going on. And I'm bouncing around and bumping into shit because
[42:26.140 --> 42:29.580]  I can't see anything. And I don't know what lights to turn on because you turn on one light in a
[42:29.580 --> 42:34.880]  hotel bathroom and suddenly every light turns on and the fucking blinds open up and it starts
[42:34.880 --> 42:40.360]  playing music and the TV's flashing. And so I just fumble around in the dark and I do everything in
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.600]  my power to clean it up. And I'm in that bathroom for God knows how long. And I get it all cleaned
[42:44.600 --> 42:49.380]  up, I think, and flushed and brush my teeth and wipe myself off and everything. And then I'll just
[42:49.380 --> 42:54.140]  go and I lay down and I go to bed and I pass out from exhaustion. And then we get up in the day
[42:54.140 --> 42:59.280]  and we're getting ready in the morning and Bernie and Vanessa come over to our room. And I haven't
[42:59.280 --> 43:03.980]  been in the toilet area at all. I've only brushed my teeth and stuff. And Bernie goes, I gotta take
[43:03.980 --> 43:09.820]  a piss. And he goes and take a piss. And he goes, oh my God! And I'm like, what? And I run in,
[43:10.140 --> 43:17.440]  I had missed so much vomit. It was on the walls to the left of the toilet. It was like Purple
[43:17.440 --> 43:24.180]  Nightmare. It was on the top of the toilet. It was on the wall behind the toilet. It was everywhere.
[43:24.180 --> 43:30.980]  And I was horrified and mortified. It's one of the most embarrassing and grossest things I've
[43:30.980 --> 43:37.720]  ever done. And it's, I hate to say it, not as gross as the next story. Oh, come on. Come on.
[43:38.320 --> 43:44.180]  What do you mean? Last night, last night, by the way, I was fine after that. Had a great rest of
[43:44.180 --> 43:51.960]  the day. Last night, I, uh, I, I played hooky. I stayed up late and I was an irresponsible little
[43:51.960 --> 43:55.980]  boy and I played video games with my friends until way too late. We played, uh, we played
[43:56.460 --> 44:01.700]  gun trucks as I've decided to start calling it until about, uh, until about, well, just about
[44:01.700 --> 44:08.200]  145 or so. Right. And then, uh, go to bed or go like shut everything down, walk into the bedroom,
[44:08.640 --> 44:13.760]  go to my side of the bed. Albert is sleeping on the far end of the bed with Emily. They're
[44:13.760 --> 44:17.920]  pretty far away. We have a king bed, so there's a lot of room. I smell a whiff of something.
[44:18.700 --> 44:23.760]  Once again, pitch black in my room, right as I'm about to get sit on my bed to like take my jammy
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.340]  pants off and take my shirt off and then get under the covers right where I'm about to sit.
[44:28.440 --> 44:31.460]  I just catch a whiff of something and I stop. It just makes me stop on my tracks.
[44:32.260 --> 44:37.720]  And I look and I can kind of see something like a mound on the bed. And I, and I get in there.
[44:37.780 --> 44:40.080]  I look, cause you know, it's pretty dark. There's a little bit of moonlight. And I realize
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.560]  the dog has thrown up. The dog has thrown up on my side of the bed, right at chest level,
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.920]  like right where I was about to sit. I was about to sit in a pile of dog vomit, right?
[44:50.440 --> 44:56.640]  And I'm there by the grace of God or whoever. I smelled just a whiff of that. And maybe because
[44:56.640 --> 45:00.700]  I had just thrown up so much, I still had a little bit of that, that puke smell in the back of my
[45:00.700 --> 45:07.840]  throat. I recognized it quickly. And I, I shut down before I accidentally sat my fucking soggy
[45:07.840 --> 45:13.900]  ass balls in dog puke, right? So I'm like, oh my God, this fucking sucks. Emily is asleep. The
[45:13.900 --> 45:18.240]  dog is asleep. I'm in the same situation where I don't want to wake them up because if the dog
[45:18.240 --> 45:23.240]  wakes up, all bets are off. Right? And then poor Emily, she works 12 hours a day. She needs her
[45:23.240 --> 45:29.900]  sleep. And so I like pick up all the dog puke and I put it in the toilet and I get some more and I
[45:29.900 --> 45:33.600]  put it in the toilet. And then I do my best to scrub it with a washcloth. And I realized I got
[45:33.600 --> 45:38.460]  to take the sheet off, like the blanket off. Luckily we, Emily is a weirdo and sleeps with
[45:38.460 --> 45:42.540]  900 blankets. I've talked about her sleep procedure before. It includes like eight
[45:42.540 --> 45:46.220]  different blankets. She's like, she has blanket mountain, like Andrea has pillow mountain.
[45:47.080 --> 45:53.020]  And so I have to definitely take the comforter off around the dog and Emily without waking them
[45:53.020 --> 45:57.380]  up. And I go and I put it in the washing machine and I start doing laundry at this point, 2.15 in
[45:57.380 --> 46:02.800]  the morning or whatever. And then I go back and I clean myself off and I crawl into bed and I put
[46:02.800 --> 46:07.500]  my hands on top of the blanket, uh, like at my, you know, you just put your hands down and I feel
[46:07.500 --> 46:13.300]  wet. And I'm like, and so I get up and I look and the puke had seeped through a little bit.
[46:13.500 --> 46:19.460]  So it was just damp, but that grossed me out so much. I get up out of bed and I strip that
[46:19.460 --> 46:23.920]  blanket off the bed around Emily and around the dog. And I take it out into the other room.
[46:23.920 --> 46:27.980]  Cause obviously I can't, I can only have one washing machine. And then I clean my hands
[46:27.980 --> 46:35.020]  off again and I go back in and I go to bed and I fall back asleep. Maybe two hours later. I don't
[46:35.020 --> 46:38.420]  know cause I didn't look at a clock, but it's maybe four or four or 30 in the morning. I wake
[46:38.420 --> 46:46.340]  up desperate to piss, desperate to piss. And so I get up and I fumble and I'm, I'm wrecked at this
[46:46.340 --> 46:51.240]  point. Right. Cause I stayed up way too late. I've only had two hours of sleep. I've I'm doing laundry
[46:51.240 --> 46:55.480]  in the middle of my sleep. It's a whole fucking thing. And I go into the bathroom and I sit down
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.600]  on the toilet and I piss and I'm just like kind of half asleep. Just not all there, you know,
[47:00.640 --> 47:04.560]  as you are. And I reached back and I flushed the toilet and I don't immediately get up and I don't
[47:04.560 --> 47:08.660]  know why, but I just like, I'm just like sitting there for a second, you know, just, I don't know,
[47:08.700 --> 47:14.940]  existing. And then as I'm sitting there in the toilets flushing, as I'm about to get up and go
[47:14.940 --> 47:19.320]  to the bathroom, I, uh, cause I, I sit down to pee at night because I don't want to turn lights
[47:19.320 --> 47:24.360]  on and wake my wife up. Right. Yeah. Something really weird happens. I feel a sensation that
[47:24.360 --> 47:29.740]  immediately jolts me awake and I realize it's water on my dick. And I'm like, why is there water
[47:29.740 --> 47:35.640]  on my dick? If I'm sitting in the toilet, I look down, the dog puke clogged the toilet.
[47:36.760 --> 47:43.180]  I pissed into the toilet, flushed the toilet, all the dog puke and piss came back up. And my dick
[47:43.180 --> 47:49.140]  is in it, just sitting in it as the toilet is starting to overflow around me. So I have to
[47:49.140 --> 47:56.700]  jump up and unclog the toilet with a plunger for way too long while Emily and the dog are trying
[47:56.700 --> 48:02.360]  to sleep and then clean my entire body at this point, because I have dipped my dick into dog
[48:02.360 --> 48:08.220]  puke and pee water at this point. And, uh, and now I don't ever want to go to bed again. I'm scared
[48:08.220 --> 48:16.660]  of the dark. I don't. This has all been in the space of like six days. I, I, can you imagine
[48:16.660 --> 48:22.280]  when you were feeding Albert that you would, if, if, imagine if someone came back through time and
[48:22.280 --> 48:28.960]  said, some of that would be on your dick, Leah. I couldn't in a million years. No, no. Two things.
[48:29.120 --> 48:35.540]  I did two things in the same night that I've never done before. I kicked my own dick and balls and
[48:35.540 --> 48:44.380]  then I stuck my dick in wet dog puke. Oh, oh, that's so gross. Terrible first, terrible first
[48:44.380 --> 48:50.500]  to be having it 49 years old. And I'm then now I'm the night plunger. Now that is a new horror
[48:50.500 --> 48:54.860]  that has been unlocked for me. And I just, I just am wrecked. I don't know what to do. I don't know
[48:54.860 --> 48:58.040]  what to do about going to bed at night anymore. Maybe I'll just stay up and play video games till
[48:58.040 --> 49:02.640]  dawn. I don't know, but it's been, I'm just terrified. I'm scared to go to bed tonight.
[49:02.700 --> 49:06.980]  Honestly, I swear to God. So is it all flushed and then came back or you just, yeah, it was all
[49:06.980 --> 49:11.620]  flushed. No, I had flushed and it was all flushed, but I guess, I guess it didn't go, you know, I
[49:11.620 --> 49:15.240]  guess it was just like stuck in the tube or whatever. And so when I flushed again, it just
[49:15.240 --> 49:23.480]  like backed up. Oh, wait, wait, wait. You flushed while you're sitting? Yeah. I flushed while I was
[49:23.480 --> 49:27.740]  sitting in that moment. I was just, like I said, I was like, I was just like fucking exhausted and I
[49:27.740 --> 49:31.460]  was sitting on the toilet and I peed and then I just reached my hand back to flush and I was going
[49:31.460 --> 49:35.100]  to get up or whatever, right as I did it. But I just like, I just like sat there for a second
[49:35.100 --> 49:39.500]  because I wasn't, I didn't have my faculties about me. But I feel like sometimes if I do like a
[49:39.500 --> 49:46.680]  flush, I always lean forwards because otherwise your cock gets splashed. My toilet doesn't splash
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.500]  my cock. This toilet, my old toilet definitely did, the one that I had the total on, it was like
[49:52.500 --> 49:56.440]  you couldn't put your dick anywhere near that toilet because there was water coming from every
[49:56.440 --> 50:00.900]  direction at all times. But yeah, this one, this is kind of a, listen, it's a rental toilet, right?
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.880]  It's not, it's not the best toilet I've ever used. It's not even close. It's a, it's a toilet that
[50:05.880 --> 50:10.100]  because of the way the shelf sits, because it's shallow, I have to, it's why I'm a three scrubber
[50:10.100 --> 50:14.300]  a day kind of guy because of these toilets. I'm not, I'm not, I got no defense for these toilets,
[50:14.440 --> 50:16.820]  but they don't get my dick wet normally.

[51:06.720 --> 51:07.460]  Got a new tattoo.
[51:09.880 --> 51:11.600]  What is it of?
[51:12.840 --> 51:16.120]  Is it a heel on your balls?
[51:17.180 --> 51:23.880]  That's an idea. You remember when we were having that whole conversation about the pineapple
[51:23.880 --> 51:27.860]  tattoo that Emily and I have and how we unintentionally got swingers tattoos,
[51:27.860 --> 51:30.640]  even though they're not upside down pineapples, it's still like,
[51:31.240 --> 51:33.900]  kind of creeps us out and it's kind of embarrassing and funny.
[51:34.580 --> 51:40.620]  Well, Emily, the other day at work was screwing around in the back room on her break and she drew
[51:41.660 --> 51:45.880]  on her on her little pineapple. She drew a pair of sunglasses
[51:47.260 --> 51:49.820]  and she thought it was really cute. And she was like, what if we
[51:51.140 --> 51:55.020]  redid our tattoos? What if we modified our tattoos to be party pineapples?
[51:55.780 --> 52:03.800]  And so on her birthday, we went and we got I got we got sunglasses, arms and legs put on our tattoos.
[52:03.900 --> 52:07.460]  I took it and it's upside down because I don't give a shit. But anyway,
[52:07.760 --> 52:10.140]  so that's my new party pineapple tattoo.
[52:10.580 --> 52:12.920]  Wait, you don't give a shit with the whole point?
[52:13.640 --> 52:20.260]  I don't know why you said that. That's just a photo. I just put the photo upside down.
[52:20.420 --> 52:22.960]  No, I know. But the whole point of the pineapple is that, you know,
[52:22.980 --> 52:26.200]  if it would be upside down and then you send it to us upside down.
[52:26.360 --> 52:28.560]  Yeah, just because I'm a bad photographer, though. Here, hold on.
[52:29.700 --> 52:30.580]  Hold on. That's wild.
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.460]  OK, that's great. That's phenomenal. Anyway, you can see the little heels on his shoes.
[52:37.580 --> 52:41.480]  Yeah, he's got little hands and little boot. He's got little SpongeBob shoes and then sunglasses.
[52:42.240 --> 52:46.020]  So anyway, now we have party pineapple tattoos. And you look at that tattoo too.
[52:46.420 --> 52:47.860]  What? What?
[52:49.240 --> 52:53.820]  You look at that tattoo and you don't think Swinger. You think that person's down to party,
[52:54.080 --> 52:57.560]  but a healthy, keep your clothes on kind of partying.
[52:58.620 --> 53:02.160]  Yeah, I mean, I agree until you send us a photo of it upside down.
[53:02.360 --> 53:03.700]  Yeah, well, that's just because I'm a shitty photographer.
[53:04.020 --> 53:05.620]  I think it was a Freudian photography.
[53:05.960 --> 53:08.380]  It might have been. A Freudian snap.
[53:08.380 --> 53:10.520]  Yeah, Freudian snap.
[53:12.220 --> 53:14.200]  Oh, Jeff, I'm so sorry, man.
[53:14.600 --> 53:18.140]  Hey, thanks. It's been a real dog shit kind of a couple of days in that way.
[53:18.220 --> 53:20.420]  Did you at least enjoy Survivor with our guy?
[53:20.620 --> 53:23.500]  I loved Survivor and I love our guy.
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.240]  I don't want to spoil the show for people that haven't seen it on this podcast.
[53:28.440 --> 53:31.720]  Even maybe they haven't seen it like Gavin. I don't know. But man, it was a great episode.
[53:32.740 --> 53:37.140]  And he is really seems really genuinely likable.
[53:37.680 --> 53:40.320]  Yes. Like one of the most one of the standout
[53:41.280 --> 53:43.160]  initial standout likable people on the show.
[53:43.360 --> 53:44.840]  Absolutely. I liked him on this podcast.
[53:45.440 --> 53:47.680]  I liked his stance.
[53:48.540 --> 53:49.820]  Yeah, I think we all like the stance.
[53:50.240 --> 53:54.060]  Well, you know, the opinions divided maybe on a stance.
[53:54.340 --> 53:57.860]  I don't think we're unified in that, but great first episode.
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  And I feel really good about him sticking around for a while.
[54:01.060 --> 54:02.600]  It seems like he's on a really good team.
[54:03.120 --> 54:05.760]  I don't think they're going to go to tribal for a bit.
[54:05.760 --> 54:07.620]  So I'm excited.
[54:08.400 --> 54:12.680]  Yeah, I think we're going to get to see him on TV for a little bit, which is going to be nice.
[54:12.780 --> 54:16.420]  When I was at Disneyland, there were a billion families there, right?
[54:16.440 --> 54:18.600]  Because it's Disneyland and apparently it was ski week,
[54:18.660 --> 54:21.500]  which is something that exists on the West Coast I hadn't heard of.
[54:21.580 --> 54:24.720]  Yeah, I guess before spring break in California and other
[54:24.720 --> 54:26.900]  places in, I guess, the Pacific Northwest,
[54:27.140 --> 54:30.900]  they have a ski week where kids get off school to go skiing for the week.
[54:31.700 --> 54:33.980]  And so they're and but they don't go skiing.
[54:34.040 --> 54:35.240]  They go to Disneyland for some reason.
[54:35.240 --> 54:37.420]  So there was 10 billion people in Disneyland,
[54:37.540 --> 54:41.740]  but there were so many kids and families there that just looked miserable.
[54:42.320 --> 54:46.120]  And all I could think about is how many times I took Millie
[54:46.120 --> 54:50.540]  to places around the world or to theme parks or to things like this as a child.
[54:50.660 --> 54:52.380]  And she has zero memory of it.
[54:52.440 --> 54:54.900]  I'll be like, hey, do you remember that time we did that thing in Tokyo?
[54:54.900 --> 54:56.100]  And she's like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[54:56.140 --> 54:58.460]  And I'm like, you, you were like eight.
[54:58.560 --> 54:59.620]  And she's like, yeah, I don't know.
[54:59.640 --> 55:00.460]  I don't remember that far back.
[55:00.720 --> 55:03.520]  And I realized that most of it was worthless.
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.900]  You're just doing it for yourself because the kid is not going to remember any of it.
[55:07.940 --> 55:09.300]  Which gave me an idea.
[55:10.260 --> 55:13.120]  Do you think you could, with the use of AI,
[55:14.440 --> 55:21.060]  just invent a bunch of family vacation photos for your kid's childhood and just
[55:22.020 --> 55:23.060]  display them around?
[55:23.340 --> 55:25.820]  And if your kid ever asks about it, just be like, wait, you don't remember?
[55:25.960 --> 55:29.640]  We used to go every fucking year because they're not going to remember anyway.
[55:29.760 --> 55:32.520]  So why waste the time and the money going to Disneyland
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.120]  just Photoshop or get AI to make a couple of pictures of your kid really happy
[55:37.120 --> 55:40.040]  or crying with a fucking spilled ice cream on the ground and be like,
[55:40.100 --> 55:40.960]  yeah, that was the time when you were six.
[55:41.020 --> 55:41.880]  We went to Disneyland. You loved it.
[55:41.920 --> 55:42.660]  Remember? You don't remember that?
[55:42.860 --> 55:44.100]  Hey, you got a shirt. I think we threw it away.
[55:44.500 --> 55:47.760]  I just immediately visualized that scene in the Truman show where they're
[55:47.760 --> 55:49.860]  showing him as a kid in front of Mount Rushmore.
[55:50.600 --> 55:52.480]  Yeah, it's essentially that, right?
[55:53.180 --> 55:57.260]  You could totally do that and get away with it because your kid would never know.
[55:57.520 --> 55:59.120]  Maybe that'd be a good service you could start.
[55:59.120 --> 56:03.980]  You could start the retroactive good parenting pack that you could download.
[56:04.320 --> 56:07.100]  Oh yeah, the childhood memories pack.
[56:09.040 --> 56:16.180]  You give us like 30 photos of your kid and we'll give that kid the childhood of a lifetime.
[56:17.140 --> 56:19.740]  Win them over by putting their children into AI.
[56:20.940 --> 56:26.420]  I really like this as a game show where it's like family photos and the kid has to figure
[56:26.420 --> 56:30.480]  out which ones are real. And it's just parents in the background crying,
[56:30.840 --> 56:35.880]  knowing how much they spent on these trips. This one yearly trip that they would go on,
[56:35.960 --> 56:40.900]  or like the big trip across multiple years. This is not... I've never been there. Never seen it.
[56:41.580 --> 56:45.540]  It is criminal how little kids remember of those vacations.
[56:46.020 --> 56:50.600]  I remember my first vacation. My parents were a little bit bummed to find out that
[56:50.600 --> 56:55.320]  the only thing I remembered from going to Spain as a kid was that I really liked the fire hose
[56:55.320 --> 57:02.240]  in the hotel. I apparently really liked stuff that would go around, around, around, around.
[57:02.900 --> 57:08.920]  And, uh, like wheels, uh, the washing machine, fire hose, loved it. Loved round stuff.
[57:10.760 --> 57:11.940]  Big round guy?
[57:12.580 --> 57:15.260]  As a kid, loved it. Like if people were visiting,
[57:15.500 --> 57:18.940]  I would run outside when they left to watch the wheels on the car as they drove.
[57:19.540 --> 57:29.080]  I remember my first vacation. Uh, I was a big Scooby-Doo kid and we went to some hotel in San
[57:29.080 --> 57:36.660]  Francisco and the bookshelf, uh, was a secret, like there is a bookshelf in the room and you
[57:36.660 --> 57:41.380]  could open it and it was a closet. It was just like a coat closet, essentially. It was not a
[57:41.380 --> 57:46.400]  fancy secret room, but I opened it not knowing it was there. It was one of those things like
[57:46.400 --> 57:49.860]  Scooby-Doo or the bookshelves always open. So I was like, I'll pull on this bookshelf.
[57:49.900 --> 57:56.840]  And then it actually opened and I was so excited and it greatly falsely set my expectation for
[57:56.840 --> 58:01.480]  how many times in life I will encounter a bookshelf that opens into something else.
[58:01.540 --> 58:07.860]  That was it. One and done. But as a kid, I was like, Oh my God, are these just things? Like,
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.960]  is this prevalent? Is this the thing that will happen to me? I've never encountered another
[58:13.780 --> 58:17.720]  bookshelf that has something behind it. Very sad. I know what you mean. When I was a kid,
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.360]  because of Webster, I thought every cuckoo clock had a secret passage in it. Oh, that's cool.
[58:24.080 --> 58:27.620]  So did you ever go to the library as a kid and just get really bummed out that none of them were
[58:27.620 --> 58:35.740]  doors? It's gotta be one somewhere. They keep telling me books are a door to my imagination,
[58:35.800 --> 58:42.220]  but I can't open the fucking thing. I was cleaning up my notes as you were telling
[58:42.220 --> 58:46.020]  that story, Andrew. And I saw this note, the note from my story. I just had to post it to
[58:46.020 --> 58:48.440]  you guys before I deleted it because it's fucking, I realized how ludicrous it looked.
[58:48.440 --> 58:51.280]  Cuck, puke, water, penis, puke, and shit LA.
[58:52.600 --> 58:55.800]  I like the idea. It's like, this is a good idea.
[58:56.100 --> 58:59.200]  Regulation IDs. Cuck, puke, water, penis, puke, and shit LA.
[59:01.780 --> 59:06.300]  So you both poisoned yourselves just from rides and candy?
[59:06.620 --> 59:08.040]  I think so. You surely had something bad.
[59:08.400 --> 59:11.140]  How could you get that sick from just sloshing around?
[59:11.140 --> 59:14.980]  Two different days apart. I don't know. Like she puked on one night and I puked the next.
[59:15.080 --> 59:19.160]  And I felt fine after, and I felt fine when I went to bed. I only felt bad at two in the
[59:19.160 --> 59:23.560]  morning when I woke up. I think it was just like motion sickness and stuff from the...
[59:23.560 --> 59:27.640]  That makes sense for puke. Like I've definitely puked from being shaken around, but diarrhea.
[59:28.400 --> 59:31.420]  How the, how did that happen? I think all the nausea and stuff
[59:32.880 --> 59:37.060]  in addition to the, uh, God, we tried to list it. Bernie and I tried to list it
[59:37.060 --> 59:40.020]  the other day and it was like, it was too much, dude.
[59:40.620 --> 59:42.680]  Well, then he said you had a McDonald's straight after.
[59:43.100 --> 59:48.140]  Oh, I had McDonald's. Yeah. Yeah. Then we had McDonald's right after. It was pretty bad.
[59:48.440 --> 59:52.860]  Well, and once again, like Jeff, he, you deal with like diverticulitis, right? Like you have
[59:52.860 --> 59:58.660]  stomach issues, you have bowel issues. Like I don't, I think shaking is possible in Jeff's
[59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.860]  environment. Oh, that's another thing. It's true. It's like all shit is diarrhea for me.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:09.180]  You know, it's like, I haven't not had diarrhea in 10 years, so it's just varying degrees of how
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.200]  it's going to be. So if I had to poop in the middle of the night, it was going to be diarrhea
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.780]  regardless. This was just another level. And I think it was just another level because of the
[01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:23.720]  level of terrible things I ingested that day. Man, you were talking, you were talking about
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.540]  that with the, uh, the truck boys. Cause we were playing war zone recently. And then, uh,
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:33.100]  and then last night, well, this is what blew me away a little bit earlier, right? Before we
[01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.980]  started recording. Cause last night you played and I went to bed early cause it was a school night
[01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:42.580]  and Andrew said, what do you mean school night? Yeah. What, what do you, what do you want?
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:47.680]  That's been a thing since, that's been a thing since fuckface. Yeah. Yeah. But also just in
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.920]  general, you never had a, you never had a school night. No, I understand the premise of a school
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.500]  night. No, I guess that late on a school night, Andrew. No, I get that. I just, I didn't know
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:01:02.380]  that you were still in a needy, a good sleep school night era for a Wednesday night. I try
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.360]  and get the best sleep of my life. Really? I'm ready for the recording. How has that gone for
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:12.240]  you? Statistically speaking, how many Wednesday nights since the show has started, would you
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.440]  describe as the best sleep of your life? It's typically the worst night of sleep I get. Mainly
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.960]  because I'm thinking about everything the next night or the next day. And I'm worried about,
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:26.100]  Hey, I'm trying to get all my stories and my ideas. And I ended up just thinking. I had a,
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:32.020]  I had a dreadful sleep. Cause I stayed up until 4.00 AM. Is it because you were sat up, right?
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:39.720]  Trying to fall asleep? No, no, I, I, I fucked up real bad. And, uh, I had a donut for my partner
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:46.340]  and I misplaced the box. Uh, I thought it was one place when it wasn't. And, uh, I noticed when I was
[01:01:46.340 --> 01:01:50.440]  kind of moving around in my chair earlier in the evening that there was like something stuck in it.
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:55.220]  And I was like, well, it was fucking annoying. And, uh, they were really hungry. They came to
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:02:00.740]  bed to get their donut. And I had driven over their donut in my office chair. I ruined it.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:06.500]  Uh, why? Okay. I'm going to ask the obvious question. And I think everyone's assuming
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:13.960]  the same thing. Why was it on the floor? Uh, cause I'm cleaning. I'm cleaning somewhere.
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.900]  Why was it there? That's where, that's where clocks go and other important items in Gavin's
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:27.240]  office. That's where mirrors go for you, where you shave. The floor's dirty. That's where all
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:35.760]  the stuff lands. It was in a box. It was completely sealed. I had moved it. I bought a
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.620]  new storage thing for vinyls. And so I put all the vinyls in there and they had on top of it.
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:45.300]  And then I went to move the vinyl thing. So I moved the box and I just forgot that I had done
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:51.360]  that. And then at some point I would have wheeled the chair back and I'm also changing like bed
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:57.380]  stuff. So I thought, Oh, I just got some sheets in the wheels, whatever that sucks, but I'll just
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:04.000]  force on through. But it wasn't sheets. It was the box. And I had crumpled the box and the donut
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.440]  and they found it on the floor and they were very upset about it. Understandably so. So I thought
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:15.980]  I need to make this right. They're hungry. They're going to be hungry. And they wake up in the
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:23.700]  I'm going to order a little little treat. We get breakfast delivered to the house on time before
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:30.520]  it starts, except Uber Eats would not let me schedule an order in advance. And then it was a
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:36.420]  whole thing where like they wouldn't show me the breakfast menu until 4 a.m. for this place. And so
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:42.880]  I just stayed up till 4 a.m. so I could order this because I fucked up that donut. And then I just
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.740]  couldn't sleep. So I'm probably on like an hour. If you have to if you have to do something in the
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:55.700]  morning, your go to move is just to wait until just go to sleep and wake up later. Just how am
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.780]  I going? No, I don't trust myself with vibrate. I know I'm going to sleep through a vibrate.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.960]  Thought about it. Even if you were mad at your partner and wanted to do something mean to them
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.580]  to express your anger, it wouldn't be as mean as the thing you accidentally did.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.240]  Yeah, I felt terrible. It's like not only did I destroy it, I fucking
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:22.180]  rubbed it into the ground to make sure nobody on earth will ever enjoy one fucking morsel of
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:28.000]  this food. And then I covered everything in its like corpse, essentially. And it was at like 1130
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.220]  at night. It was really like it was too late to fix. It was just it was a bad moment. So you
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:40.000]  waited for the breakfast menu to show up. You waited until four. Yeah. And even though it's
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:47.040]  a school night. Well, what's that? Yeah. Well, what was infuriating about it is it kept I have
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:52.560]  like five McDonald's in this town and they close at different times. And I'd wait for one to close
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.780]  because it wouldn't let me schedule an order unless it was closed. And as soon as one would
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:05:01.120]  close, they would just pivot me to a different McDonald's that was open later. And I kept
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.980]  progressing the clock back until I eventually found a way to view all of the McDonald's.
[01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:09.920]  And then it wouldn't let me schedule it because I couldn't. It's just it was a whole thing.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:12.940]  Wouldn't the move just be a deal? I'll deal with it tomorrow.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.620]  No, because I wake we wake up on the same alarm for the show.
[01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.700]  So how would I wake myself up? There's no way for me to wake myself up without waking them.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.720]  Wake up and order it. But I'm four a.m. I'm going to need an alarm. I have to wake up in
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.760]  four hours. I haven't slept. Wait, what? What time are they waking up? They wake up when I wake up.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.740]  But why did you order it when you woke up? Because I because there's not. Okay,
[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.480]  let me explain. Let me know. I understand. I understand confusion.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:54.700]  They they like waking up. I wake up and they wake up 30 minutes before I record just to like
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.280]  relax, slowly wake up before having to leave the space for me to work.
[01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:06.860]  So I wouldn't I wanted to get us both breakfast. So it had to be then. And I want I assume they'd
[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.900]  be hungry when they woke up because they were hungry when they went to bed. So I wanted to
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:15.100]  be able to provide food as soon as they woke up as a make good for destroying the doughnut.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:20.400]  Here's the thing about doughnut as well. Anyone can lose the doughnut and it's fine.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:26.760]  If you if you lose out a doughnut, it was just a treat anyway. A doughnut surely isn't isn't
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:32.220]  a guaranteed part of the meal that you are relying on. Okay, well, here's the thing. I ruined two
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:44.840]  doughnuts actually. That was the backup doughnut. Yeah, I forgot about that. What do you mean?
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:55.840]  I had so I got I had doughnuts. I had doughnut holes the night before and I saved one because
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.420]  it's from a place we'd never been to. And I ate them all the first time. And this is the second
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:04.100]  time that I've ordered from this place as I made sure to save one. But then they didn't end up
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.560]  eating it and they burnt the doughnuts. And so it was really dry. So I ended up throwing it away.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:14.000]  So they went to get it and they went, oh, no, you didn't tell me that you got rid of it. And that
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.840]  was that. I took a hit there and I said, well, you got the other doughnut. So you got that at least.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:27.780]  I'm sorry. And then they left and then they came back a few hours later and went for the other
[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:33.860]  doughnut that I assured them was there and discovered it trampled. Why is the doughnut
[01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:38.920]  a part of dinner, though? They just wanted a doughnut. They were hungry and it was what was
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:46.000]  upstairs. Sometimes you just want a doughnut. Listen, you don't like sugar. You don't like
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.260]  sweet things. I don't expect you understand this. It's true. I mean, I'll have a doughnut.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:56.440]  Usually it's like a morning coffee doughnut. I don't like I don't like an 11 p.m. doughnut.
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:08:02.120]  I don't think. Yeah, this is I think that's on you. And that's that's difference between cultures,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:07.100]  maybe. Yeah, I've also I've also never really bought like a six or dozen pack of doughnuts.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:11.940]  I'm just like a one doughnut guy. I wonder at this point, with everything that Andrew's
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:18.440]  told us about this doughnut, what else he's leaving out or doesn't remember with a whole.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.600]  Yeah, there's like a second doughnut involved with this really threw me for a loop, dude.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:28.760]  Yeah, no, it's fair. There was no third doughnut. There would have been. However,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.580]  I had eaten. I would have eaten. That would have been one I consumed.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.900]  How many were eaten then of this pack of doughnuts?
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:40.360]  OK, so it was a 10 pack of the mini doughnuts from the other night. I ate nine of them.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:48.000]  And then what? And then I didn't eat any of the other doughnuts. I got a Danish
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.880]  instead and they had a doughnut from this. But how could you eat nine doughnuts in a day?
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.220]  They're mini doughnuts. Mini doughnuts. Like that's still a lot. That's that. How many like
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:07.400]  four? No, is it? It's not. It's not a lot. OK, I could house so many more than that without even
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.780]  thinking about if they're the powdered sugar doughnut doughnuts, I could eat 40 right now
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:17.680]  and without giving me the chocolate ones. Unstoppable. I won't even take a fucking breath,
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.640]  dude. It sounds like we got to do an Eric versus Jeff mini doughnut on the board.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.920]  I'll feel so sick. I don't give a fuck. I'll make a day out of it. Eric and I,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.020]  Eric and I'll eat doughnuts and we'll ice Gavin's balls. That's I'm putting it on the.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.780]  I'll put it on the list. Supplemental Jeff versus Eric eating little doughnuts.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.840]  Go get your dilly bar, Nick. It's going to melt while he's getting here. Can I ask you guys a
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:54.800]  question? I'm in a bit of a confused and paranoid era, and I was hoping you guys could help me with
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.400]  a little bit of clarification, if you don't mind. OK, OK. The other day I texted everybody a link
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.200]  to a tick tock. I saw the tick tock was of some people playing baseball. And what they had done
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:13.720]  is they had put an egg on like a stand, like essentially at the pitcher's mound.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:19.860]  And then they were trying to hit baseballs at the egg and crack the egg. Right. So I sent that to all
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:26.240]  of you. And I said, this is funny. We could do something like this. But what if it was like
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.420]  a minefield of all of our own personal stuff that we don't want broken and we have to try to break
[01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:36.360]  it or hit break other people's stuff or whatever? And we just kind of like populate a baseball field
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:41.480]  with shit that matters to us, that's breakable. And then we just try to destroy it. And then
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.320]  I never heard back from anybody. And I thought, oh, I'm not supposed to text these guys because
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.580]  I don't get the responses from the green text. And then I thought, or maybe that was a one time thing
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:56.720]  and maybe just nobody liked my idea or thought or even responded. And I don't know which was which.
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:02.440]  And so I decided to wait until the episode to ask. So it's a confusing thing to add. Goddammit,
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:10.480]  you replied? I never got it! No, no, calm down, Jeff. I don't know. Did you reply in the same
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:16.760]  text thread, Gavin, as the thing? Do you want a screenshot? Yes, I'd love that. Because I have
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:24.000]  a text group called Regulation Texting. And that's where that went. But I have another text group that
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.560]  is all of you guys as well. And your messages go in that one. So wait, what's in the original one?
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:37.560]  I'm going to post a quick screenshot. This is what I saw from my perspective of Jeff's text
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:47.080]  and then nothing in that text room in response to it. Look at mine. See that? Yeah, I got Gavin
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.680]  replying. A really cool opportunity came through this morning. I don't see that either. What is
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:57.980]  that about? What? You've talked about it already. No, you guys were talking about it earlier and I
[01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.180]  thought I must have missed the first half of the conversation because I got up to get a drink.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.780]  So I just picked up on it from context clues, but I had no idea where it originated from.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:10.560]  So you didn't get any of that? Like they must have heard how many players WormsWMD has and Eric
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:15.360]  saying... I don't know what any of that what you're saying is. No. Here's what I have. I feel
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.820]  like somehow this is Jeff's fault. I'm getting them in two different boxes, but I'm getting all
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.900]  of them. They're just separated. Is that why, Jeff, the other day you were like, hey, is everything
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:28.780]  all right with everyone? Maybe. No, he just wanted to check in on us. I just had a weird vibe.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:35.440]  Here's what I got. Here's what I got. I just texted test. Did you get those test texts?
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:42.100]  I got test. I got test. It's below Andrew's screenshot. Yeah. No, I didn't. I did one above
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.300]  it and then one below it. And so the problem here is Jeff. Yeah, Jeff, you're just not getting text.
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:53.840]  Do you have RCS turned on? Probably not. What is RCS? How do I turn that on? I believe it uses the
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:01.080]  internet for cell... what previously would have been like a cellular message. RCS messaging.
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:07.320]  Do I want it turned on or off? On. On. It's on. Because it's kind of like how you can use the
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.740]  internet for texting green. Yeah, I don't know, because it's never been an issue before. But now,
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:18.640]  all of a sudden, I just... it's... I can't. Maybe we just have to start a new text thread. Maybe
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.240]  we can demolish that one and start a new one. Because here... hold on, I'm going to load up
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:28.200]  Discord. This is what... Maybe someone deleted it on their phone and then it created a new one
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:34.660]  on their phone. Maybe, because this is what I have. This is the most recent conversation I have
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:40.020]  from you guys is Monday at 6.35 p.m. when I sent you that TikTok. I have received nothing from the
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:45.360]  company since then. What the fuck? So I'm completely in the dark of anything you may or may not be
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:50.660]  talking about. Delete this thread. We talk all the time. No, we don't. We don't talk all the time.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:57.460]  We absolutely don't. Delete that conversation. So you've missed one, two, three, four, five,
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.180]  six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven messages since. Yeah, that's why I'm brought it up,
[01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:08.440]  because I'm terrified that I'm missing stuff. Yeah, you are. Damn. I don't even know how to
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.620]  fix that. I feel like Andrew's usually to blame, but this feels like a Jeff thing.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.840]  Yeah, it's a Jeff thing. I'm going to delete it. This conversation will be deleted.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.700]  Should I do that? I fight back against Andrew's to blame. This Andrew's to blame narrative.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:26.860]  Well, I don't think that's the case. It's a thing where I think we're all on iPhone.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.760]  Yeah, you have to blame clearly because everything is traditional.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.280]  Like there's like so many. That's fair. That's fair.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.340]  I thought we meant in a general sense. No, I thought we were doing a general narrative.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:44.800]  I would say that when we're talking about things to blame,
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.800]  I'm always having to fucking hunt down Gavin for files that he hasn't uploaded for Let's Play stuff.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:55.220]  Yep. I have noticed that decline in my habit is that it's no longer one. And I don't know why.
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:01.340]  And I had to ask him for something. And I eventually I finally just asked you,
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:06.420]  Gavin, why? Why does this happen? Like, do you forget? Not in a way of like aggressive. I was
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:10.440]  just like, how does this keep happening? You're the only one that I really have to do this with.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:13.820]  No idea. I've always got it. I've never deleted it.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.940]  Yes. You always find it immediately. Like once we talk, you're like, yeah,
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:21.680]  I have it. I'm uploading it now. I was like, why? Why does this happen?
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.860]  And it was the I think only time Eric has ever uploaded the wrong file into something.
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:34.120]  And I was I finally asked you, I counted. I've had to ask you 19 times for different files.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:40.740]  My God. Eric has once prior to this. I finally ask you, why is this happening?
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:45.220]  And your response was, well, Eric uploaded the wrong file. That's certainly just as bad.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:50.060]  And I went, you motherfucker. The one time, the one time you haven't out with Eric,
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.460]  you son of a bitch. And then you never acknowledged the question again.
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:58.760]  You just floated into the night. Yeah, I apologize. I don't know why I stopped.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.080]  I think it's when I switched to doing video on one computer and audio on the other.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.780]  Makes total sense. One or the other.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.860]  I notice it. It's especially bad if we batch record. So I feel like you just don't go through
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:14.260]  the upload process and then you forget and walk away. Can I tell you something as well, though?
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:17.380]  You recently asked me to upload files for a video that was being edited,
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:22.980]  and it was something we've recorded a ton of. So I went ahead and looked at the folders after that.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.800]  I hadn't put audio or video in for like the next four videos.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.960]  What is wrong with you? And I quickly did it all before it became a problem.
[01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:34.080]  Are you fucking new? Like, what are you? I have new brain.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:38.080]  I really appreciate that, Gavin. Yeah, I saw your test and I saw that
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.560]  you changed the name and I replied. I got the test.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.180]  I didn't get it. Okay, you are on SMS and not RCS.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.940]  I have RCS enabled. It says it's enabled. It says... yeah, that's interesting.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.120]  It says SMS. It says SMS for you and RCS for everyone else.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.660]  Yep. That's weird.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.960]  What is it called again? RCS? Yep.
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:02.460]  RCS. We should end this podcast.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.720]  Yep. I've been having fun doing it, though. I'm enjoying it.
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.140]  I'm having fun, too. I just I don't think we need...
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.300]  Once again, I have it enabled. I've disabled it and now I'm enabled it.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.680]  30 minutes of Jeff tech support in this podcast.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.340]  You need to restart your phone and then that'll fix it.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.500]  Speaking of tech support, Andrew, what are we doing tech support?
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.580]  Friday, we're doing Sloppy Joe's.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:26.980]  Oh. Oh.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.120]  We should stop this podcast, but I wanted to... Yeah, no shit.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.120]  I wanted to... Andrew's going to give you some sort of a lame answer and
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:38.920]  not actually schedule it. But there is something I do want to schedule that I
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.140]  think you guys will want to do. I came up with an idea for a new draft.
[01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:43.360]  I want to throw you away. Sidekick draft.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.540]  Oh, that's good. I'll put it in the list.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:48.360]  We have our next two lined up. Are we adding that to the mix?
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.380]  No, we'll do it on a different one. Yeah, we'll do it on a different one,
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.360]  but just put it in the queue. Sidekicks. Best sidekicks.
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:57.860]  I'm putting it in the list. Oh, shit. That's a good one. Oh, man.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.300]  OK. OK. All right. Well, there you go.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.620]  Then we should wrap this up.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.080]  Yeah. Andrew, you were about to take us out, I think you said.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.780]  Yep. Once again, this is another shit filled disgusting.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.760]  Jeff has a problem podcast brought to you by us.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:18.320]  Check out our Patreon Regulation Pod. Everybody got daily bars except Eric
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.240]  because I don't know where he lives. He also doesn't compete.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.900]  So I wouldn't buy one for him anyway. I'm not going to do anything for it.
[01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:24.820]  Yeah. Go ahead.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:28.960]  Yeah. And you can check out at Patreon.com slash the Regulation Pod
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:32.460]  with a free membership. You can watch Mario Party March
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:36.160]  every day in March. And then at the end of the month,
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.660]  we'll have it in a full video on our gameplay channel.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.900]  So go check it out, because I feel like we said Mario Party March,
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.300]  but didn't talk about the details. Those are the details.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.580]  I cannot wait. We start tomorrow is our first day.
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.180]  I'm so excited.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:52.220]  Are you going to order the donuts tonight or?
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.900]  Yeah, you know, I well, now I made up for it. I ordered the other stuff.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.600]  I'm fine. I'm fine.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.440]  Could you could you text them and make sure I'm fine?
[01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:04.280]  I think I'm fine. Jeff will do it.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.760]  All right. See you next time. Bye.
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:06.340]  Bye.
