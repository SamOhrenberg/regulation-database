[01:23.390 --> 01:23.830]  one.
[01:24.850 --> 01:27.550]  Remember how that Ridley Scott Delta Force game is coming out?
[01:27.630 --> 01:27.770]  Yeah.
[01:27.870 --> 01:30.650]  That was Medal of Honor was Saving Private Ryan, right?
[01:30.990 --> 01:32.550]  And they partnered with him or something, or?
[01:32.670 --> 01:33.390]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:33.550 --> 01:35.290]  I think so. That's so long ago.
[01:35.350 --> 01:35.910]  What does it matter?
[01:35.970 --> 01:37.830]  What is the Ridley? What's the Ridley Scott game?
[01:38.110 --> 01:41.590]  The we saw it at Summer Games Fest where they're like
[01:41.590 --> 01:44.990]  levels inspired by the Black Hawk Down film.
[01:45.150 --> 01:48.050]  That's right. It's it was called like Delta Force.
[01:48.150 --> 01:48.750]  Delta Force, yeah.
[01:48.750 --> 01:49.290]  I don't think you saw this, Gavin.
[01:49.390 --> 01:52.190]  It's like Delta Force, Black Hawk Down.
[01:52.190 --> 01:56.890]  And it's just like you are the Black Hawk that has gone down
[01:56.890 --> 01:58.190]  and you must escape.
[01:58.350 --> 02:00.750]  And it's like, oh, what year does this game come out?
[02:00.890 --> 02:01.990]  What happened?
[02:02.390 --> 02:04.830]  Feature sequences from the Ridley Scott film.
[02:04.890 --> 02:06.910]  And it's like that that was a movie based on a real event.
[02:07.270 --> 02:08.510]  It's sort of a weird framing.
[02:08.650 --> 02:09.410]  It's so bizarre.
[02:09.710 --> 02:12.230]  I mean, there's probably some exaggerated action.
[02:12.590 --> 02:13.890]  But what are we doing here today, Andrew?
[02:13.890 --> 02:15.710]  We're regulating is what we're doing.
[02:15.810 --> 02:17.690]  We are doing them calling this the regulators.
[02:17.910 --> 02:19.870]  We are the regulation crew.
[02:19.870 --> 02:22.350]  This is not all of us, but we have three people here.
[02:22.510 --> 02:23.710]  That's enough for a majority.
[02:24.250 --> 02:24.590]  Fuck them.
[02:24.850 --> 02:25.170]  Fuck Nick.
[02:25.270 --> 02:25.610]  Fuck Eric.
[02:25.670 --> 02:26.210]  They're not here.
[02:26.510 --> 02:27.170]  They don't get to decide.
[02:27.210 --> 02:27.590]  They got to live.
[02:27.630 --> 02:28.730]  Well, now let's be clear.
[02:28.910 --> 02:29.570]  I'm Eric.
[02:30.130 --> 02:31.210]  Oh, I said Eric.
[02:31.350 --> 02:31.910]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:32.090 --> 02:32.810]  Yeah, Nick.
[02:33.230 --> 02:33.590]  Sorry.
[02:34.270 --> 02:34.930]  Sorry, man.
[02:35.170 --> 02:36.390]  Gut reaction.
[02:38.850 --> 02:39.890]  Andrew's filler wasn't on.
[02:40.130 --> 02:42.570]  No, I just was looking at our chat.
[02:42.650 --> 02:46.430]  I just read your name and I was used to you being away last week.
[02:46.430 --> 02:47.610]  So I'm still adjusting.
[02:47.610 --> 02:50.190]  Um, fuck Nick.
[02:50.390 --> 02:51.930]  Fuck Jeff is what I meant to say.
[02:52.030 --> 02:52.450]  OK, cool.
[02:52.670 --> 02:53.490]  Yeah, OK, really?
[02:53.730 --> 02:56.270]  And we got to pick stuff.
[02:56.430 --> 02:58.730]  We got to set regulations on things.
[02:58.930 --> 03:02.050]  Now, I used to have the regulation bagel and that was great.
[03:02.350 --> 03:08.130]  So I figured we could go through some items and deem what we view as the regulation version
[03:08.130 --> 03:09.150]  of that thing.
[03:09.370 --> 03:12.530]  Oh, these are things with a variety of options.
[03:13.550 --> 03:17.430]  So we've been we've been deep in our hot dog era right now.
[03:17.430 --> 03:20.550]  Eating lots of dogs inside of I don't think Gavin.
[03:20.730 --> 03:22.470]  I don't think you've had a hot dog, have you?
[03:22.550 --> 03:23.030]  Since we started.
[03:23.190 --> 03:24.310]  Not yet. I'm not on the board yet.
[03:24.370 --> 03:24.950]  Not on the board.
[03:25.670 --> 03:27.910]  Now, but here's the thing about the hot dog board.
[03:28.330 --> 03:34.070]  And I had to explain this to my dad when I told him about the hot dog, the dog count situation.
[03:34.410 --> 03:39.050]  When I said like, oh, yeah, I've had like five this month and like that's the most I've had all year.
[03:39.050 --> 03:41.570]  And he went, oh, so it's like a competition to see who can eat the most.
[03:41.610 --> 03:44.530]  And I went, no, it's just a counter to see how many you've had.
[03:44.530 --> 03:50.030]  However, it is activating something within me that makes me feel like it is a competition
[03:50.030 --> 03:55.430]  where I have to keep up and eat the most hot dogs, which negates the whole situation.
[03:55.610 --> 04:00.650]  I would. Yeah, I'd love to talk to Jeff about if that is the same for him,
[04:00.870 --> 04:04.550]  because that man's on like 10 dogs and we're like three weeks into this.
[04:05.010 --> 04:07.050]  And the whole point is, this seems crazy.
[04:07.510 --> 04:08.750]  Like no one's going to hit 70.
[04:09.230 --> 04:09.690]  He is.
[04:09.790 --> 04:10.370]  Oh, my God.
[04:10.410 --> 04:11.670]  He is consuming so many.
[04:11.670 --> 04:14.570]  But I think we need to set what is the regulation hot dog?
[04:15.110 --> 04:18.010]  What do you view if you were to say, I want a hot dog?
[04:18.250 --> 04:22.050]  What do you think is the expectation of what that package is?
[04:22.290 --> 04:23.210]  Dog ketchup busted.
[04:23.750 --> 04:24.550]  Oh, you don't.
[04:24.750 --> 04:27.310]  OK, but here but here's the thing.
[04:27.350 --> 04:33.370]  Like, I think people get so feisty about what's on a hot dog in specific.
[04:34.170 --> 04:34.530]  Yeah.
[04:35.650 --> 04:40.390]  Like, I think like Chicago is like a big like, you know, ketchup, ketchup, right?
[04:40.390 --> 04:41.210]  Like, isn't that weird?
[04:41.870 --> 04:43.590]  It is. They're like aggressive about it.
[04:43.750 --> 04:44.250]  Yeah.
[04:45.170 --> 04:50.910]  Uh, I googled hot dog and it came up with a ketchup and mustard dog.
[04:51.310 --> 04:51.910]  Interesting.
[04:52.410 --> 04:53.550]  I would agree.
[04:54.010 --> 04:59.830]  I think there'd be a large percentage of people arguing maybe onion or relish.
[05:00.370 --> 05:04.190]  Yeah, and I think that's kind of like where I land more.
[05:04.430 --> 05:09.910]  However, we have to consider that this isn't necessarily what we like,
[05:09.910 --> 05:16.130]  right? It's more about what if you were to get just, hey, we're getting hot dogs.
[05:16.350 --> 05:19.490]  This like we're not saying anything about it's just hot dogs, right?
[05:19.590 --> 05:23.010]  I think we have to like it, but it it's not necessary.
[05:23.390 --> 05:27.530]  Like, if we're setting the regulation, it should probably be representative of us.
[05:27.870 --> 05:31.090]  But I think there also has to be some consideration of like
[05:31.670 --> 05:33.750]  what the expectation is of that thing.
[05:33.750 --> 05:40.430]  This, this is going to be very hard for me, um, personally, because I hate ketchup.
[05:41.150 --> 05:42.410]  I hate yellow mustard.
[05:43.250 --> 05:44.410]  I hate relish.
[05:45.110 --> 05:48.170]  I hate like most of the stuff that goes on a hot dog.
[05:48.430 --> 05:52.470]  Here's three hot dogs. I look at these and I go, terrible.
[05:54.150 --> 05:57.630]  So the three hot dogs are one ketchup, one relish, one mustard.
[05:58.030 --> 05:58.470]  Yes.
[05:59.050 --> 06:01.370]  Where does your moisture come from?
[06:01.710 --> 06:03.190]  Where does the wetness happen for you?
[06:03.190 --> 06:09.450]  I, I like a sriracha or typically a chili cheese, uh, is usually what I go with.
[06:09.490 --> 06:15.170]  However, I can't in good conscience say the default, like the regulation hot dog
[06:15.170 --> 06:17.910]  is a chili cheese dog because that's a separate thing.
[06:17.910 --> 06:20.210]  And that's where I'm coming from with this, where it's like...
[06:20.210 --> 06:21.130]  That's totally fair.
[06:21.790 --> 06:26.790]  Yeah, like it's hard for me because I don't like, I don't like ketchup and I like,
[06:26.870 --> 06:29.490]  you know, hearty, like stone ground mustard.
[06:29.490 --> 06:31.030]  I don't like French's yellow.
[06:31.230 --> 06:32.690]  I think it tastes so bad.
[06:32.690 --> 06:33.830]  I think it tastes so, so bad.
[06:34.870 --> 06:37.550]  What about Grey Poupon or whatever that other one is?
[06:38.030 --> 06:39.790]  Yeah, you need like the stone ground mustard.
[06:39.970 --> 06:41.170]  Like that's, that's my move.
[06:41.250 --> 06:43.950]  But like, man, I don't, I don't know.
[06:44.010 --> 06:46.370]  Gavin, like when you eat a hot dog, what are you, what are you putting on your dog?
[06:47.570 --> 06:49.890]  Uh, if I'm eating a dog, it's probably a baseboard.
[06:49.970 --> 06:51.050]  I'm just putting ketchup and mustard.
[06:51.390 --> 06:54.870]  And if there's onions, I'll stick those on, but nothing more advanced than that.
[06:54.890 --> 06:56.910]  You're really, I'm shocked you're not a relish guy.
[06:57.270 --> 06:58.370]  Relish feels so like...
[06:58.370 --> 06:59.730]  No, it looks rough.
[07:00.370 --> 07:03.010]  It's, it's, it's like bad Branston.
[07:03.350 --> 07:05.510]  I was going to say to me, it's Branston adjacent.
[07:05.810 --> 07:07.090]  I figured you'd be all about it.
[07:07.510 --> 07:08.870]  Yeah, but it's too like pickly.
[07:09.370 --> 07:11.250]  Even though Branston pickle is just...
[07:11.250 --> 07:12.490]  Yeah, I don't understand.
[07:12.910 --> 07:14.050]  What are you talking about?
[07:14.970 --> 07:16.170]  It's Branston pickle.
[07:16.870 --> 07:17.490]  This is good.
[07:17.670 --> 07:20.710]  It's already, the whole, it just started and it's already fallen apart.
[07:20.830 --> 07:21.490]  This is fantastic.
[07:22.350 --> 07:25.110]  I had no idea you felt so strongly about ketchup and mustard, Eric.
[07:25.230 --> 07:26.470]  That's really interesting to me.
[07:26.470 --> 07:30.890]  Yeah, I, I've just never been that way.
[07:31.050 --> 07:32.830]  I just don't like that stuff.
[07:33.050 --> 07:37.430]  Ketchup is so sweet to me that it just doesn't belong on most things.
[07:38.450 --> 07:40.890]  And then mustard, like French's yellow mustard.
[07:41.490 --> 07:44.590]  It's just not, it's not appetizing.
[07:44.690 --> 07:45.930]  I don't think it smells or...
[07:45.930 --> 07:46.150]  Sure.
[07:46.290 --> 07:47.030]  It like looks...
[07:47.030 --> 07:47.390]  Oh, it smells terrible.
[07:47.390 --> 07:47.690]  Or anything.
[07:48.150 --> 07:48.350]  Yeah.
[07:48.630 --> 07:49.030]  Ketchup grown me.
[07:49.430 --> 07:51.570]  I didn't have ketchup until I was in my twenties and I moved here.
[07:51.710 --> 07:52.150]  Really?
[07:52.370 --> 07:53.590]  I always avoided it.
[07:53.670 --> 07:53.750]  Yeah.
[07:54.170 --> 07:54.610]  Interesting.
[07:55.010 --> 07:55.490]  Don't know what happened.
[07:55.490 --> 07:56.410]  Just palate change.
[07:56.490 --> 07:57.930]  Maybe we, we start more gradually.
[07:58.050 --> 07:59.090]  Can we agree on a bun?
[07:59.350 --> 08:01.650]  Are we just talking like a standard white bun?
[08:01.650 --> 08:03.970]  It's gotta be just, yeah, I think it's gotta be just a standard one.
[08:03.970 --> 08:07.330]  Like no poppy seeds, no, just a basic plain ass white bun.
[08:07.330 --> 08:10.050]  Yeah, I think it's, I think it's gotta be just a straight white.
[08:10.230 --> 08:18.530]  Like, I'm, I, I also think those ones that are cut along the top, like the new fangled bun.
[08:18.690 --> 08:21.290]  I think that's too much, like advanced bun technology.
[08:21.390 --> 08:21.610]  Sure.
[08:21.690 --> 08:23.450]  I just need the one that you like set on the side.
[08:23.510 --> 08:24.590]  It's like a regular hot dog bun.
[08:24.750 --> 08:25.430]  I think that's it.
[08:25.430 --> 08:26.050]  Yeah.
[08:26.390 --> 08:27.950]  Okay, so we all agree on that.
[08:28.450 --> 08:29.690]  All basic hot dog.
[08:29.790 --> 08:32.970]  We were not trying for no smoky, no brat, like no crazy.
[08:33.410 --> 08:35.590]  This, the standard package dog.
[08:36.370 --> 08:36.510]  Yeah.
[08:36.970 --> 08:38.350]  Now we're at the condiment issue.
[08:38.790 --> 08:40.050]  It's a big issue.
[08:40.510 --> 08:41.490]  It's a big issue.
[08:42.530 --> 08:46.570]  Because it sounds to me like there's a world in which you would have mustard, just not.
[08:46.970 --> 08:48.630]  Yeah, like stone ground mustard.
[08:48.690 --> 08:52.810]  Like a, like a big, you know, like the big seed, like actual mustard.
[08:52.970 --> 08:53.750]  I like that.
[08:53.750 --> 08:55.750]  What about English mustard?
[08:56.130 --> 08:57.570]  Oh, what is English mustard?
[08:58.430 --> 09:03.390]  It's yellow still, but it, it's, it will like blast up your nostrils if you have too much.
[09:03.870 --> 09:06.390]  Oh, like, oh, so it's a hot, it's like a hot mustard.
[09:06.930 --> 09:08.230]  It's not, it's.
[09:08.430 --> 09:09.830]  We talking horseradish-y?
[09:10.130 --> 09:12.570]  It's very horseradish-y, yeah, it's Coleman's.
[09:12.970 --> 09:13.830]  Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[09:13.830 --> 09:16.130]  Comes in a powder sometimes or in a little pot.
[09:16.150 --> 09:17.230]  I don't want powdered mustard.
[09:17.250 --> 09:18.110]  Used very sparingly.
[09:18.530 --> 09:18.810]  Huh.
[09:19.090 --> 09:21.290]  I mean, I guess I could be okay with that.
[09:21.450 --> 09:23.610]  I don't know that I've had it.
[09:23.750 --> 09:24.290]  Um.
[09:25.030 --> 09:25.990]  Oh, we got to get you some.
[09:26.350 --> 09:27.770]  Oh, okay.
[09:27.770 --> 09:29.990]  What if we all present to you our dogs?
[09:31.530 --> 09:33.530]  But I just told you all the things I don't like.
[09:33.650 --> 09:35.110]  I don't think I would be the right person for this one.
[09:35.110 --> 09:37.850]  I think it would be more the mustard that we'd present him with.
[09:38.250 --> 09:39.010]  Mustard alternatives.
[09:39.270 --> 09:42.710]  Yeah, and, and also I don't want to do anything with mustard.
[09:42.850 --> 09:43.270]  I hate it.
[09:43.290 --> 09:43.430]  Yeah, that's fair.
[09:44.150 --> 09:46.810]  I'm convinced that you'll like my mustard.
[09:47.290 --> 09:49.590]  So, so it's this one on the left, the English mustard.
[09:49.770 --> 09:51.150]  It's like thick peanut butter.
[09:51.150 --> 09:55.090]  Yeah, but don't confuse it with like French's, which looks very similar.
[09:55.350 --> 09:56.210]  Yeah. Okay, cool.
[09:56.330 --> 09:57.310]  I mean, I would try it.
[09:57.410 --> 09:58.730]  I just think French's is terrible.
[09:58.750 --> 10:02.850]  And I really like that, that beer mustard, like the picture that I just said.
[10:02.970 --> 10:03.030]  Yeah.
[10:03.030 --> 10:05.030]  That really like stone ground, like huge seeds.
[10:05.310 --> 10:06.810]  That I think is so good.
[10:06.910 --> 10:07.710]  I love that.
[10:07.970 --> 10:11.450]  Um, but I don't think that's what people go to for hot dogs.
[10:11.970 --> 10:13.910]  I think, uh, do we have to get...
[10:14.850 --> 10:17.510]  And I guess we have to decide, do we have to get super specific?
[10:17.510 --> 10:19.510]  Or could we just say a mustard?
[10:19.970 --> 10:22.410]  A mustard is on the dog and that's good enough.
[10:22.930 --> 10:25.730]  I could say, I could go with just mustard on a dog.
[10:26.190 --> 10:29.610]  The problem is ketchup, because I don't think there's a ketchup alternative to you.
[10:30.050 --> 10:35.910]  No, I think that there's just, I think, I think I will have to sort of acquiesce and be like,
[10:35.970 --> 10:41.250]  this is a thing I don't enjoy, but I understand why people need it on their hot dog.
[10:41.330 --> 10:42.090]  What about bacon?
[10:42.330 --> 10:44.050]  Like that's too extravagant, right?
[10:44.210 --> 10:44.650]  Or is that...
[10:44.650 --> 10:48.270]  Love it, love it, but does not, I don't think when I think regulation hot dog,
[10:48.330 --> 10:49.110]  I don't think it's on there.
[10:49.110 --> 10:51.790]  And no cheese as well. I assume that's in the same category.
[10:52.310 --> 10:57.290]  Yeah, I think that cheese is more in like the chili cheese dog territory.
[10:57.390 --> 10:57.610]  Okay.
[10:57.710 --> 11:00.770]  And that just becomes, that's like a different food altogether.
[11:02.730 --> 11:03.490]  I guess.
[11:05.370 --> 11:08.450]  Here's the dilemma that I kind of, in my head, I'm now facing with this.
[11:08.850 --> 11:13.470]  I love ketchup, but I'm okay with just mustard on a dog.
[11:13.610 --> 11:16.070]  However, it feels kind of insane for us to say,
[11:16.070 --> 11:19.910]  the regulation hot dog is a plain hot dog with just mustard on it.
[11:20.570 --> 11:22.930]  No, I think the right, honestly,
[11:23.650 --> 11:27.270]  honestly, what I would propose is the regulation hot dog is just a hot dog on a bun.
[11:27.730 --> 11:29.810]  That's what I just plain hot dog.
[11:30.350 --> 11:34.970]  Oh, I don't mind a plain hot dog. I'll have a plain dog.
[11:35.590 --> 11:36.630]  What a bun.
[11:36.730 --> 11:40.050]  Oh, I'll eat. I'll eat nine playing hot dogs. Yeah. I don't give a shit.
[11:40.350 --> 11:40.910]  Come on.
[11:40.950 --> 11:41.290]  Yeah.
[11:41.530 --> 11:41.930]  Yeah.
[11:42.090 --> 11:44.930]  Oh, you got to get the real flavor of the bread and the meat.
[11:46.550 --> 11:48.250]  The flavor of the bread.
[11:48.370 --> 11:51.970]  I got to taste, I got to taste the pigeon beak and raccoon feet.
[11:52.130 --> 11:53.330]  Otherwise, what am I doing here, Gavin?
[11:54.230 --> 11:57.370]  This is raccoon 1989, I believe.
[11:58.250 --> 11:59.690]  A slight hazelnut.
[12:00.110 --> 12:05.450]  This is insane. I think you're going to make the regulation hot dog on a bun.
[12:07.170 --> 12:09.730]  There's already just ketchup and mustard.
[12:10.590 --> 12:12.690]  Well, the problem is I'm thinking about the other guys.
[12:12.790 --> 12:15.370]  I think Nick hates ketchup, doesn't he? Or Jeff hates ketchup.
[12:15.370 --> 12:16.510]  So one of them hates ketchup.
[12:16.870 --> 12:17.650]  You know, I don't know.
[12:17.790 --> 12:19.130]  I think one of them hates ketchup.
[12:19.130 --> 12:23.050]  Even if you hate ketchup, though, it doesn't... a dog, you can plow through it.
[12:23.450 --> 12:24.170]  It's not a dog.
[12:24.690 --> 12:26.250]  Yeah, I listen. I'm all for it.
[12:26.550 --> 12:30.630]  Again, I'm fine with acquiescing and I'm totally fine with it.
[12:31.130 --> 12:36.610]  So it sounds like we're in agreement that the regulation dog is not necessarily French's
[12:36.610 --> 12:42.170]  mustard, which is, I feel, what most people would say, but a mustard of some kind.
[12:42.170 --> 12:43.350]  Mm hmm.
[12:43.470 --> 12:44.830]  Ketchup of your choice.
[12:45.350 --> 12:46.650]  And then just a basic white.
[12:46.770 --> 12:48.830]  No, no bacon. No cheese.
[12:49.170 --> 12:51.450]  Just dogs, ketchup, mustard.
[12:52.010 --> 12:54.050]  I think I think that's what it has to be.
[12:54.150 --> 12:58.750]  I think that's what I think people would argue that like a relish belongs on there.
[12:58.770 --> 13:01.950]  But I'll I'll stand on that hill and say, like, no, I don't think so.
[13:02.030 --> 13:03.070]  Like, I don't.
[13:03.130 --> 13:03.830]  Yeah, I'm not for it.
[13:03.890 --> 13:04.690]  I don't like relish.
[13:04.850 --> 13:05.790]  So I have no problem.
[13:05.850 --> 13:05.950]  Yeah.
[13:06.470 --> 13:07.370]  Yeah, I think it's this.
[13:07.430 --> 13:10.650]  I just said, yeah, it's the that's that's hot dogs.
[13:10.650 --> 13:13.090]  I like that there's relish, but they're not using it.
[13:13.190 --> 13:15.710]  Yeah, there also appears to be onions.
[13:16.150 --> 13:18.410]  So, you know, I like that.
[13:18.430 --> 13:22.470]  We're in agreement just before we move off of hot dogs to lock in this regulation dog.
[13:23.250 --> 13:25.290]  Do you get artistic when you do the condiment thing?
[13:25.350 --> 13:27.250]  I never the lines and all that.
[13:27.330 --> 13:28.370]  I'm not one of those guys.
[13:28.770 --> 13:31.570]  No, I put it I put it down the side of the dog in the bun.
[13:31.650 --> 13:34.130]  So that way it's not splashing all over the place.
[13:34.250 --> 13:34.370]  Yeah.
[13:34.910 --> 13:35.830]  What about you, Gavin?
[13:36.570 --> 13:37.530]  You a little condiment artist?
[13:37.530 --> 13:39.870]  Pretty similarly to the the picture there.
[13:40.110 --> 13:43.430]  But usually I'm doing, you know, two or three at a time because I don't want to go up to the
[13:43.430 --> 13:44.750]  counter twice.
[13:45.050 --> 13:45.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[13:46.010 --> 13:47.650]  So my first one is usually the nicest.
[13:47.850 --> 13:49.190]  And then I'm getting pretty messy on the third.
[13:50.790 --> 13:51.630]  We did it.
[13:51.770 --> 13:53.990]  We established the regulation dog.
[13:54.510 --> 13:55.750]  But but hang on before we go.
[13:55.870 --> 13:57.070]  I just propose this.
[13:57.170 --> 13:57.790]  Look at these.
[13:58.150 --> 13:59.610]  I listen, Eric, I'm with you.
[13:59.690 --> 14:00.350]  I love it.
[14:00.590 --> 14:01.670]  Just a plain ass.
[14:01.790 --> 14:05.950]  Here's just here's just like here's just eight dogs.
[14:06.810 --> 14:08.790]  Just eight hot dogs, nothing on them.
[14:09.550 --> 14:11.870]  You couldn't put those out with nothing else.
[14:12.010 --> 14:16.230]  Yeah, people would be like, people would pick up the bun and the dog and start looking around.
[14:16.410 --> 14:18.550]  They'd be like, where's the where's the station?
[14:18.710 --> 14:22.890]  Imagine, Eric, you and I just sitting down, chowing down on some plain dogs.
[14:22.970 --> 14:25.250]  Gavin is looking at us like we're psychos.
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.330]  I could easily eat three of those things.
[14:27.810 --> 14:29.030]  Like, just no doubt.
[14:29.650 --> 14:30.130]  No doubt.
[14:30.270 --> 14:32.130]  Yeah, we're just playing dogs, baby.
[14:32.650 --> 14:33.090]  Dogs.
[14:36.370 --> 14:40.110]  Okay, I have a I just thought of a game, actually, before we move fully on.
[14:40.230 --> 14:40.430]  Of course.
[14:40.490 --> 14:41.050]  Okay, cool.
[14:41.330 --> 14:43.970]  Opinion on on my game.
[14:44.090 --> 14:45.230]  Let me get pictures.
[14:45.450 --> 14:45.650]  Okay.
[14:45.930 --> 14:51.730]  What if we did a game where you make you make four dogs, right?
[14:51.870 --> 14:52.150]  Okay.
[14:52.290 --> 14:56.510]  And you take a picture that's sliced like this.
[14:58.010 --> 15:02.290]  But one, you present five pictures, four of them are dogs.
[15:02.470 --> 15:03.950]  And one is my penis.
[15:04.110 --> 15:05.450]  Okay, I don't want to play this.
[15:05.450 --> 15:07.430]  I don't want to play this game at all.
[15:07.650 --> 15:11.690]  I don't want to play this game.
[15:11.890 --> 15:16.190]  It's going to be because they're all going to look professionally lit like this,
[15:16.210 --> 15:20.230]  except the one that you use the flash on in your bathroom.
[15:23.330 --> 15:24.390]  Oh, my God.
[15:25.270 --> 15:26.910]  Oh, it's just like a dark room.
[15:26.990 --> 15:28.370]  It's like white, white, white, dark.
[15:32.330 --> 15:34.590]  What's wrong with the color of this hot dog?
[15:35.450 --> 15:38.050]  Would you put ketchup on your dick for the photo, Gavin?
[15:38.110 --> 15:38.930]  Like to what extent?
[15:40.410 --> 15:42.370]  Make them all match for sure.
[15:42.670 --> 15:46.250]  Oh, man, that's a terrible game.
[15:46.770 --> 15:48.790]  You fucked up my algorithm, by the way.
[15:48.850 --> 15:53.590]  I got a TikTok the other day from a woman who runs the glory hole business
[15:53.590 --> 15:55.470]  talking about how she set it up.
[15:55.770 --> 15:56.090]  What?
[15:56.290 --> 15:58.850]  And it has like it had like 200 likes.
[15:58.990 --> 16:00.670]  Like it was not you.
[16:00.830 --> 16:01.310]  No way.
[16:01.710 --> 16:02.750]  Yeah, it's the whole thing.
[16:02.750 --> 16:03.750]  I watched it.
[16:04.170 --> 16:07.170]  Just completely curious of what even is this world.
[16:07.390 --> 16:11.330]  But you're fucking up my algorithm and you just keep making it worse.
[16:12.830 --> 16:13.750]  That's dogs.
[16:13.990 --> 16:14.850]  Regulation dog.
[16:15.210 --> 16:17.770]  Ketchup, mustard, bun, basic, basic dog.
[16:17.970 --> 16:18.270]  Essentially.
[16:18.570 --> 16:19.210]  Yeah, we're in agreement.
[16:19.510 --> 16:20.090]  Nothing fancy.
[16:21.130 --> 16:23.710]  We have a few things we go from here.
[16:23.950 --> 16:27.050]  What about we do French fry cut for a lot of food?
[16:27.090 --> 16:28.250]  OK, on this one.
[16:28.310 --> 16:30.750]  But it's the main thing I can think of variety of.
[16:31.110 --> 16:31.690]  What about fry?
[16:31.690 --> 16:33.010]  What is the regulation fry?
[16:33.250 --> 16:35.410]  I feel like curly is too fancy.
[16:35.850 --> 16:38.270]  Yeah, I I'm particular.
[16:38.570 --> 16:43.150]  I'll eat any French fry, but I'm particular about which fry that I like, like which which
[16:43.150 --> 16:44.130]  one I enjoy the most.
[16:44.310 --> 16:48.190]  And to me, it is the standard McDonald's cut French fry.
[16:48.490 --> 16:52.110]  The thin, small, long and crispy French fry.
[16:52.390 --> 16:56.150]  That to me, that's that's the French fry.
[16:56.350 --> 17:00.670]  When I think of French fry, it's that it's not a wedge cut.
[17:00.670 --> 17:01.370]  It's not curly.
[17:01.650 --> 17:05.230]  It's the standard idea of a French fry.
[17:06.950 --> 17:08.470]  I the only criticism.
[17:08.570 --> 17:08.970]  I choose that.
[17:09.190 --> 17:09.950]  Yeah, right.
[17:09.970 --> 17:10.390]  Exactly.
[17:10.770 --> 17:11.890]  It's exactly the same thing, Gavin.
[17:12.450 --> 17:13.570]  Yeah, pretty much.
[17:13.630 --> 17:14.550]  Maybe less pale.
[17:16.070 --> 17:17.870]  Right, right, right, right.
[17:17.910 --> 17:22.110]  My only criticism with those fries is because of how small they are.
[17:22.110 --> 17:23.010]  It's really tough.
[17:23.090 --> 17:28.850]  There's a sweet spot with like a crinkle cut or a larger fry where it is extremely crispy,
[17:28.890 --> 17:29.890]  but still fluffy.
[17:30.530 --> 17:34.730]  Those fries, they're either crunchy or soft.
[17:35.510 --> 17:36.370]  There's no like...
[17:36.370 --> 17:38.170]  Yeah, you can get some real limp dick ones in there.
[17:38.410 --> 17:40.690]  Yeah, it's either limp dick or like it's a crunch.
[17:41.190 --> 17:43.170]  But the thing is, I love those.
[17:43.630 --> 17:45.370]  I love the limp ones.
[17:45.570 --> 17:46.850]  I love the crunch ones.
[17:47.170 --> 17:47.650]  I love...
[17:48.930 --> 17:50.630]  That cut of French fry.
[17:50.770 --> 17:51.870]  I don't care what it is.
[17:51.930 --> 17:52.750]  I'll shovel them.
[17:53.110 --> 17:53.990]  Like, I'll make a...
[17:53.990 --> 17:55.350]  Dude, I'll have like French fry dinner.
[17:55.570 --> 17:56.310]  I don't give a shit.
[17:56.510 --> 17:59.550]  Like, I just want to eat handfuls of them.
[17:59.550 --> 18:00.770]  I love them so much.
[18:01.030 --> 18:01.910]  I love that cut.
[18:02.050 --> 18:10.010]  The one I can't stand, the one that I think is a disgrace, is the larger, not too big,
[18:10.090 --> 18:10.710]  wedge cut.
[18:10.870 --> 18:17.190]  Like, go bigger or go smaller because the wedge cut ones there are awful.
[18:17.650 --> 18:18.490]  It's just like...
[18:18.490 --> 18:18.690]  It's... yeah.
[18:20.210 --> 18:23.030]  Here's about a sixth of a potato.
[18:23.410 --> 18:23.770]  Yes.
[18:24.790 --> 18:26.530]  That's like an English pub chip.
[18:26.770 --> 18:27.270]  That's great.
[18:28.070 --> 18:29.390]  But that's not what I want.
[18:29.590 --> 18:31.570]  Like, if I get French fries at a restaurant.
[18:31.710 --> 18:31.890]  Yeah.
[18:31.990 --> 18:34.550]  If I get French fries at a restaurant and it's those, I'm disappointed.
[18:35.050 --> 18:36.510]  It just depends to me.
[18:36.610 --> 18:38.350]  There's a huge variance in the wedge fry.
[18:38.870 --> 18:42.230]  You need to have a fantastic wedge fry for me to like.
[18:42.270 --> 18:42.570]  I agree.
[18:42.730 --> 18:43.410]  But they exist.
[18:43.910 --> 18:44.730]  It's just hard.
[18:45.170 --> 18:48.110]  I find a lot of wedge fries aren't cooked enough to my liking.
[18:48.270 --> 18:49.030]  No, I agree.
[18:49.130 --> 18:51.530]  Kind of raw a little bit, it feels like.
[18:51.810 --> 18:53.390]  I want more of a crunch in it.
[18:54.070 --> 18:57.270]  I've had wedge fries that are fantastic.
[18:57.990 --> 19:02.150]  But you got to know, like, it's not the smaller cut fry that you suggested.
[19:02.250 --> 19:06.790]  I feel like is a much higher rate of consistently good fry.
[19:07.170 --> 19:13.130]  As opposed to the wedge may go higher for me, but it is much more likely to fail miserably
[19:13.130 --> 19:14.450]  and be a not good experience.
[19:14.750 --> 19:19.250]  You're a fan of the English less than, but you suggested the smaller one.
[19:19.770 --> 19:21.310]  So even you are more of a fan of that.
[19:21.310 --> 19:24.090]  Are you now just thinking about the English style pub?
[19:24.350 --> 19:26.870]  I mean, in a pub, it wouldn't be a regulation fry.
[19:27.030 --> 19:27.930]  It would be a pub fry.
[19:28.310 --> 19:28.710]  Right.
[19:28.830 --> 19:29.370]  It'd be a chip.
[19:30.570 --> 19:33.690]  So you think that the small fry couldn't exist in every environment?
[19:35.070 --> 19:37.030]  I feel like if we're setting a regulation.
[19:37.490 --> 19:42.010]  Like with a steak, would you want normal little chips or would you want some thickies?
[19:42.210 --> 19:45.130]  I want normal chips all the time.
[19:45.850 --> 19:51.830]  But with a steak, I don't anticipate they're going to be a regular thin cut fry.
[19:51.950 --> 19:56.330]  I assume I'm going to get a large wedge to substitute for what the potato is doing.
[19:56.870 --> 19:57.010]  Yeah.
[19:57.090 --> 20:02.010]  Sometimes if you've got gravy going on or sauce, you need some soakage.
[20:02.790 --> 20:06.430]  And you don't want just really wet, thin fry.
[20:06.430 --> 20:09.650]  I will say the McDonald's poutine can it up pretty good.
[20:10.350 --> 20:12.690]  And that is a gravy situation with that fry.
[20:12.710 --> 20:12.970]  Wow.
[20:13.730 --> 20:14.190]  Would recommend.
[20:14.190 --> 20:16.790]  Never thought to get McDonald's poutine.
[20:17.230 --> 20:19.190]  I think it's a pretty regional item.
[20:19.650 --> 20:19.890]  Yeah.
[20:19.990 --> 20:22.950]  So you think, Eric, that that's the worst fries, like the thick one?
[20:23.630 --> 20:24.550]  It's the one.
[20:25.170 --> 20:27.610]  It's more the one that I sent than what you sent.
[20:27.950 --> 20:35.830]  Like the difference to me is that those like pub chip, pub fries, whatever, like the ones that you
[20:35.830 --> 20:40.210]  sent seem like they're fried pretty well and they have like some structure.
[20:40.870 --> 20:43.390]  The ones that I sent is what Andrew's talking about.
[20:43.390 --> 20:44.250]  They're pale.
[20:44.550 --> 20:46.870]  They're almost like an undercooked thing.
[20:47.170 --> 20:47.230]  Yeah.
[20:47.310 --> 20:49.910]  When I get fries, when I get fries like that.
[20:49.970 --> 20:50.130]  Yeah.
[20:50.270 --> 20:53.670]  You get fries like that and you just go, OK, put a bunch of parsley on the outside of it.
[20:53.970 --> 20:54.690]  These suck.
[20:55.130 --> 20:59.130]  Like I'm disappointed more often than not.
[21:00.870 --> 21:03.270]  And I just, you know, it's just not for me.
[21:03.770 --> 21:07.290]  I feel like the worst fry though, the least satisfying piece of shit,
[21:07.470 --> 21:09.190]  get out of my face fry is this.
[21:09.190 --> 21:13.330]  The big mountain, the big mountain of like the ultra thin.
[21:13.650 --> 21:17.630]  Ultra skinny, extra, extra thin, awful.
[21:17.870 --> 21:19.670]  They're never, you're never satisfied.
[21:20.010 --> 21:21.530]  You're never satisfied with them.
[21:21.630 --> 21:22.870]  No, it's just, it just never happens.
[21:23.070 --> 21:25.390]  See, that's a problem with me and fries in general.
[21:25.550 --> 21:26.570]  I will eat a million fries.
[21:26.690 --> 21:28.330]  So I'm never satisfied no matter the cut.
[21:29.050 --> 21:31.590]  Oh, no, I'm, I'm satisfied the whole time I'm eating them.
[21:31.710 --> 21:34.810]  That's the hard part is that the satisfaction never dwindles.
[21:34.830 --> 21:38.190]  Is that I'm constantly going like, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[21:38.190 --> 21:38.990]  It's like eating candy.
[21:39.110 --> 21:39.990]  Like, I don't want to ever stop.
[21:40.790 --> 21:42.130]  How do we feel about a waffle fry?
[21:42.750 --> 21:43.970]  I like a waffle fry.
[21:44.070 --> 21:44.990]  I just don't, I don't know.
[21:46.110 --> 21:51.830]  For it, but I also, if you said, hey, we're going to have fries.
[21:52.610 --> 21:57.310]  Or I go to a place and I order fries and their waffle cut without saying their waffle cut.
[21:57.410 --> 21:58.190]  I think that's crazy.
[21:58.590 --> 21:59.250]  That's fair.
[21:59.430 --> 22:04.150]  The thing I like about the waffle fry is it is essentially the small fries you're suggesting,
[22:04.830 --> 22:11.150]  but they have a larger variance of hitting that kind of crispy, but fluffy because there's more
[22:11.150 --> 22:11.590]  potato.
[22:12.170 --> 22:13.630]  Yeah, there's more like internal area.
[22:13.830 --> 22:17.890]  And I think they're great if you've got a real ketchup situation.
[22:18.450 --> 22:20.650]  It's like a, it's like a ketchup glove.
[22:20.970 --> 22:21.710]  It is.
[22:21.810 --> 22:23.190]  Yeah, it is great for scooping.
[22:23.510 --> 22:29.690]  I like them particularly when it's the waffle, like the waffle cut French fry, but it has
[22:30.390 --> 22:32.590]  like a curly fry kind of seasoning to it.
[22:32.650 --> 22:33.330]  Oh, yeah.
[22:33.330 --> 22:34.090]  That's when I'm real.
[22:34.190 --> 22:37.470]  That's like, I think that's when waffle fries are like at their best.
[22:37.790 --> 22:38.190]  I agree.
[22:38.590 --> 22:39.550]  I'd agree with that.
[22:40.270 --> 22:40.990]  Oh, man.
[22:41.170 --> 22:46.270]  The bad thing about waffle fries is that if it's the edge of a potato, you get these really weird,
[22:46.410 --> 22:47.730]  like curved, dreggy ones.
[22:47.930 --> 22:48.290]  Yes.
[22:48.450 --> 22:50.070]  And they are really annoying to me.
[22:50.130 --> 22:51.070]  They really piss me off.
[22:51.690 --> 22:53.390]  No, I get it.
[22:53.490 --> 22:54.890]  I mean, I totally understand.
[22:55.210 --> 22:56.310]  You feel like you're getting...
[22:56.310 --> 22:57.570]  It's like a potato chip almost.
[22:57.810 --> 22:58.330]  It is weird.
[22:59.230 --> 23:01.610]  Like the thing with a normal fry is that they're all pretty good.
[23:02.430 --> 23:02.650]  Yeah.
[23:02.650 --> 23:05.810]  The dreggy waffle fries are just really unsatisfying.
[23:05.930 --> 23:07.050]  The ratios are all screwed up.
[23:08.010 --> 23:10.550]  To me, it's the thing that Chick-fil-A does.
[23:10.670 --> 23:12.010]  I feel like I get it more often.
[23:12.130 --> 23:17.990]  It's something like Chick-fil-A where it's what you're talking about, Gavin, where it's like,
[23:18.130 --> 23:21.490]  oh, OK, you got to you got a couple of good ones.
[23:21.710 --> 23:24.370]  And then here's this like little wackadoo piece.
[23:24.490 --> 23:24.690]  Yeah.
[23:24.810 --> 23:27.150]  And it's just like, here's the outside of a potato.
[23:27.450 --> 23:31.990]  And what it is, even if the taste is fine, it's work for you because you're watching them,
[23:31.990 --> 23:32.630]  you're eyeing them up.
[23:32.710 --> 23:33.950]  You're thinking, oh, that's going to be a great one.
[23:33.990 --> 23:34.630]  I'm going to save that.
[23:34.710 --> 23:35.370]  Let me get on some of these.
[23:35.450 --> 23:38.450]  And then it's just like, I don't want to be, you know, if it's normal fries,
[23:38.490 --> 23:39.430]  I'm not really thinking about that.
[23:39.450 --> 23:40.390]  I'm just grabbing a handful.
[23:40.590 --> 23:41.290]  I'm stuffing them in.
[23:41.950 --> 23:42.270]  Yeah.
[23:42.750 --> 23:43.210]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:44.350 --> 23:52.590]  Have you had the waffle fry cut like they're very, very thin cut waffle fry like chips?
[23:52.790 --> 23:53.050]  No.
[23:54.090 --> 23:56.170]  Oh, that was like potato chips.
[23:56.250 --> 23:56.710]  So good.
[23:57.270 --> 23:57.390]  Yeah.
[23:57.510 --> 23:57.830]  Yeah.
[23:57.830 --> 24:00.950]  I would say they're more like a potato chip than they are the fry,
[24:00.950 --> 24:03.250]  but it's the same kind of principle.
[24:03.470 --> 24:04.270]  They're very good.
[24:04.390 --> 24:06.750]  They're very just thin and crispy.
[24:06.750 --> 24:09.970]  And you can mow through like a million.
[24:10.350 --> 24:11.350]  Great for dipping, too.
[24:11.450 --> 24:11.970]  I really like them.
[24:12.030 --> 24:14.610]  Is that like in a restaurant or like where would you get those?
[24:15.010 --> 24:18.430]  Yeah, there was a there's a bar in San Diego that I would go to all the time.
[24:18.490 --> 24:19.510]  And we had those on the menu.
[24:19.510 --> 24:21.630]  And you would just like, you go insane for them.
[24:21.690 --> 24:22.290]  They're so good.
[24:22.490 --> 24:25.970]  I'm going to post a general fry chart just so we could kind of lock this in a little.
[24:26.050 --> 24:26.970]  Oh, look at this.
[24:26.970 --> 24:30.030]  And then we can get Chris Demerson here and he can yell about tater tots.
[24:30.150 --> 24:30.630]  This is great.
[24:30.950 --> 24:31.510]  There they are.
[24:31.630 --> 24:32.070]  Number three.
[24:32.610 --> 24:33.610]  Not a French fry.
[24:34.750 --> 24:35.730]  Sounds like which one?
[24:35.810 --> 24:36.510]  The standard cut.
[24:36.630 --> 24:38.330]  Is that what you guys are saying is the one you're leaning?
[24:38.510 --> 24:40.410]  I would I would say standard cut would be.
[24:41.170 --> 24:41.610]  It.
[24:42.370 --> 24:42.770]  Right.
[24:43.150 --> 24:45.310]  It seems like I'm fine with that.
[24:45.530 --> 24:46.410]  I think it's a pretty good fry.
[24:46.530 --> 24:47.870]  I think everyone would agree.
[24:49.250 --> 24:51.490]  Oh, yeah, this steak fry.
[24:51.630 --> 24:52.550]  They're pretty good.
[24:52.630 --> 24:53.230]  I don't know.
[24:54.350 --> 24:57.570]  Chips British are different to steak fries and standard cut.
[24:59.870 --> 25:00.490]  Oh, interesting.
[25:00.950 --> 25:02.830]  Yeah, and there's potato wedges that should be way lower.
[25:02.950 --> 25:05.250]  I think there's a thing that you kind of touched on, Eric.
[25:05.310 --> 25:06.110]  We haven't really explored.
[25:06.990 --> 25:08.550]  Seasoning is so important on the fries.
[25:09.170 --> 25:10.290]  Do we have it like a unanimous?
[25:10.390 --> 25:12.070]  I love the curly fry seasoning.
[25:12.150 --> 25:14.250]  If I could have that on every fry, I think I would.
[25:15.170 --> 25:16.570]  I like that, too, but I don't need it.
[25:16.650 --> 25:17.830]  Like, I'm fine with just salt.
[25:18.430 --> 25:19.410]  I'm fine with salt, too.
[25:19.510 --> 25:23.550]  But I'm fine with salt because you only get the curly fry seasoning on the curly fry.
[25:23.890 --> 25:27.650]  If there was a place that just put it on all fries, I would be happy about that.
[25:28.850 --> 25:31.890]  I would never be disappointed to have that seasoning on a french fry.
[25:32.510 --> 25:36.870]  If I had crinkle cut fries with curly fry seasoning, that'd be a pretty good french fry.
[25:37.470 --> 25:38.930]  How do you feel about that, Gavin?
[25:39.530 --> 25:39.810]  Yeah.
[25:40.230 --> 25:40.630]  Yeah?
[25:41.950 --> 25:42.350]  Yeah?
[25:43.330 --> 25:46.730]  I just think, I think for a regulation french fry, it has to be salt.
[25:47.210 --> 25:48.590]  It just has to be a straight salt one.
[25:49.210 --> 25:49.530]  Okay.
[25:49.930 --> 25:53.570]  I'm confused as to why sweet potato fries would be on that list.
[25:54.310 --> 25:55.110]  How do you mean?
[25:55.710 --> 25:57.630]  I mean, is that the only non-regular potato?
[25:57.630 --> 25:58.410]  On the list?
[25:59.210 --> 26:00.370]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[26:00.590 --> 26:02.650]  That's just a different thing to me. It's a different...
[26:02.650 --> 26:05.350]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree.
[26:06.410 --> 26:08.590]  Yeah, I don't think it probably needs to be on that list.
[26:09.230 --> 26:09.590]  Okay.
[26:10.010 --> 26:11.190]  Well, it looks like we are in agreement.
[26:11.290 --> 26:15.710]  The standard cut, like the McDonald's style fry, just salt.
[26:16.530 --> 26:18.210]  I don't think there's any other variation, really.
[26:18.690 --> 26:19.990]  Condiments, do whatever you want.
[26:20.210 --> 26:21.990]  Whatever, you know, you dip it however you feel.
[26:22.190 --> 26:22.650]  Or don't.
[26:22.950 --> 26:23.130]  Yeah.
[26:23.690 --> 26:27.450]  How do you feel, Gavin, while looking at Eric and I just eating some fries, no dip?
[26:28.010 --> 26:29.350]  Any condiments for that?
[26:29.370 --> 26:29.810]  That's fine, absolutely fine.
[26:29.990 --> 26:31.050]  Okay, cool.
[26:31.190 --> 26:35.890]  All right, but then what if we eat like six fries and then we put them down
[26:35.890 --> 26:38.090]  and then we pick up six hot dogs?
[26:38.550 --> 26:39.510]  No condiments.
[26:39.750 --> 26:43.770]  What if we are dipping our fries in a condiment, but just eating plain hot dogs?
[26:44.570 --> 26:45.390]  Yeah, that'd be insane.
[26:45.810 --> 26:47.590]  I don't think anyone would ever do that.
[26:49.230 --> 26:50.550]  Oh, I've definitely done that.
[26:50.990 --> 26:51.650]  I've been there.
[26:54.130 --> 26:57.570]  Plain hot dogs, but dipping your fries in ketchup would be hilarious.
[26:57.630 --> 26:58.090]  Okay.
[27:00.290 --> 27:04.150]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks.
[27:04.510 --> 27:07.390]  It's the classic blended iced coffee you know and love,
[27:07.550 --> 27:11.090]  now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[27:11.470 --> 27:12.970]  Available for a limited time.
[27:13.210 --> 27:15.230]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[27:15.910 --> 27:17.250]  Hey, it's Paris.
[27:17.690 --> 27:19.850]  You know, I love sparkly things, right?
[27:20.070 --> 27:21.570]  Like stars, duh.
[27:21.830 --> 27:25.730]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[27:25.730 --> 27:30.650]  Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[27:31.130 --> 27:35.350]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[27:36.090 --> 27:38.390]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[27:38.910 --> 27:39.630]  That's hot.
[27:40.270 --> 27:43.310]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[27:43.650 --> 27:45.030]  Hilton for the stay.
[27:45.910 --> 27:46.510]  Uh, okay.
[27:46.550 --> 27:49.250]  We have a few things we could pick from now.
[27:49.790 --> 27:50.350]  Okay.
[27:50.390 --> 27:51.410]  I'll let you guys decide.
[27:53.250 --> 27:54.690]  We can stick with food.
[27:54.690 --> 28:00.230]  I have burger, pie, or action hero.
[28:00.790 --> 28:02.710]  Uh, I kind of want to argue about pie.
[28:02.790 --> 28:03.850]  Do you want to argue about pie, Gavin?
[28:04.190 --> 28:04.550]  Yes.
[28:05.290 --> 28:05.770]  Okay.
[28:06.250 --> 28:07.490]  What is the regulation pie?
[28:07.850 --> 28:09.570]  I love apple pie, my favorite pie.
[28:09.650 --> 28:11.570]  I don't know if I'd say that's the regulation pie.
[28:12.290 --> 28:15.230]  I feel like it's too high of a tier, in my opinion.
[28:15.750 --> 28:16.030]  Okay.
[28:16.210 --> 28:16.810]  I have a question.
[28:17.270 --> 28:19.690]  How is cheesecake not a pie?
[28:20.150 --> 28:22.150]  I don't know.
[28:22.710 --> 28:25.310]  It doesn't make sense to me either.
[28:25.450 --> 28:27.750]  It has like a biscuity base.
[28:27.890 --> 28:28.170]  Yeah.
[28:28.630 --> 28:30.310]  Like a graham cracker crust.
[28:30.810 --> 28:31.010]  Yeah.
[28:31.190 --> 28:31.550]  Yeah.
[28:32.230 --> 28:34.910]  Everything about it is pie, except in name.
[28:35.050 --> 28:35.570]  I'll look it up.
[28:35.630 --> 28:37.510]  I'll see if there's an answer to this question.
[28:38.010 --> 28:39.990]  Because if it is a pie, it's my favorite pie.
[28:40.450 --> 28:41.570]  I agree with you.
[28:41.650 --> 28:44.810]  If cheesecake is a pie, then that is the ultimate pie.
[28:44.970 --> 28:49.010]  Although if someone asked me if I wanted cheese pie, I'd be like, get that away from me.
[28:51.270 --> 28:53.830]  I think if somebody said, do you want a slice of pie?
[28:53.890 --> 28:56.270]  And then they gave me a piece of cheesecake, I would be confused.
[28:58.010 --> 28:59.270]  I would be thrilled.
[28:59.390 --> 29:01.030]  I'd be going, oh my God, we're having fucking cheesecake.
[29:01.150 --> 29:01.610]  That's great.
[29:02.470 --> 29:08.170]  I guess it's not a pie because according to the Oxford dictionary, a cheesecake is a type of tart.
[29:10.470 --> 29:11.190]  Oh, okay.
[29:13.210 --> 29:14.390]  But it is a common question.
[29:14.730 --> 29:15.410]  What makes it pie?
[29:15.510 --> 29:18.030]  The top has to be?
[29:18.610 --> 29:24.310]  I bet it's probably crust all the way up to like a top and then probably like a crust.
[29:24.490 --> 29:25.330]  Cheesecake is lidless.
[29:25.330 --> 29:27.710]  No, because pumpkin, so is pumpkin pie.
[29:28.070 --> 29:28.790]  Fuck, yeah.
[29:28.850 --> 29:29.130]  Is it?
[29:29.330 --> 29:30.390]  Pumpkin pie is lidless.
[29:30.390 --> 29:31.350]  Yeah, it is.
[29:31.470 --> 29:32.250]  I thought it had a top.
[29:32.770 --> 29:33.170]  No.
[29:33.330 --> 29:33.590]  No.
[29:33.610 --> 29:33.790]  What?
[29:33.970 --> 29:35.070]  A typical pumpkin pie.
[29:35.070 --> 29:36.870]  Here, pumpkin pie, boom, here.
[29:37.950 --> 29:39.690]  There's no top on a pumpkin pie.
[29:40.390 --> 29:41.630]  Oh, that's not, I've never had it.
[29:41.710 --> 29:42.890]  It looks repulsive.
[29:43.650 --> 29:44.970]  You've never had pumpkin pie?
[29:45.190 --> 29:45.990]  Pumpkin isn't food.
[29:46.030 --> 29:46.630]  It shouldn't be eaten.
[29:46.630 --> 29:49.710]  What about, I think pumpkin is mostly food.
[29:49.790 --> 29:50.530]  It's not food.
[29:51.470 --> 29:52.750]  What is pumpkin then?
[29:54.550 --> 29:56.190]  Yeah, it's decoration.
[29:56.190 --> 29:57.010]  It's Halloween shit.
[29:58.350 --> 30:00.010]  It's decoration you can grow.
[30:00.570 --> 30:02.270]  Yeah, it's a growable decoration.
[30:02.490 --> 30:03.530]  That's all it's good for.
[30:04.330 --> 30:07.310]  I was going to say that pumpkin pie was my pick for pie.
[30:07.670 --> 30:08.750]  That's interesting.
[30:09.230 --> 30:10.770]  God, I love pumpkin pie.
[30:10.950 --> 30:14.210]  My grandma would make it and put a layer of cheesecake at the bottom.
[30:14.490 --> 30:15.730]  Oh, oh, so good.
[30:15.730 --> 30:16.850]  Oh my God.
[30:17.070 --> 30:18.250]  Wouldn't that make it a pumpkin tart?
[30:19.930 --> 30:24.030]  I suppose so, but for the sake of this argument, I would still pick pumpkin pie.
[30:24.210 --> 30:25.790]  I could probably house a whole pumpkin pie.
[30:25.970 --> 30:27.530]  I think I could probably eat a whole pumpkin pie.
[30:27.670 --> 30:29.170]  What about, okay, well, let's find Gavin.
[30:29.170 --> 30:32.070]  What is outside of pumpkin?
[30:32.210 --> 30:33.370]  Are there any other pies you hate?
[30:34.770 --> 30:37.110]  I hate all pies that you would find here.
[30:37.190 --> 30:38.470]  I hate all sweet pies.
[30:39.130 --> 30:39.870]  I knew it.
[30:40.030 --> 30:41.530]  This is why I wanted to argue pie.
[30:42.210 --> 30:43.850]  This is why I wanted to argue pie.
[30:43.850 --> 30:46.610]  I knew that Gavin, when we go, what's the best pie?
[30:46.690 --> 30:48.470]  He was going to be like, it was going to be this.
[30:48.630 --> 30:50.190]  And this isn't even like food to me.
[30:50.490 --> 30:51.190]  This is insane.
[30:51.350 --> 31:00.050]  This is like, what if, what if you took what a dog eats on the inside of how you make an apple pie?
[31:02.350 --> 31:04.370]  And then you feed it to people as a joke.
[31:04.490 --> 31:08.350]  I don't, I just don't know why then why your pies aren't called dessert pies.
[31:08.910 --> 31:13.590]  A pie shouldn't be so, it shouldn't be able to fit in any part of the meal.
[31:13.850 --> 31:15.590]  Well, what pie came first?
[31:15.810 --> 31:17.890]  Cause it's, they're savory pies.
[31:18.070 --> 31:19.890]  Which was the first pie?
[31:19.890 --> 31:20.810]  Yeah, what was the first pie?
[31:20.830 --> 31:24.010]  I bet, I bet it was savory pies before sweet pies, don't you think?
[31:24.010 --> 31:29.190]  I would bet that too, but it is odd that there is a, pie is just pie unless it's savory pie.
[31:29.710 --> 31:34.410]  Ancient Egypt and Greece, savory pies in open pastry shells.
[31:35.010 --> 31:36.070]  Yeah. Yeah.
[31:36.170 --> 31:37.090]  That, I mean, that makes sense.
[31:37.290 --> 31:40.350]  I can't imagine ancient Egypt chowing down on some pumpkin pie.
[31:40.550 --> 31:42.690]  It just feels, that's odd.
[31:42.690 --> 31:48.270]  They found the tablet carved before 2000 BC and it was a recipe for chicken pie.
[31:49.030 --> 31:49.430]  Oh.
[31:51.730 --> 31:55.810]  I just think that when, when this is on the table.
[31:56.130 --> 31:56.730]  Oh God.
[31:57.910 --> 31:59.450]  Like, this isn't.
[32:00.730 --> 32:03.650]  This is like what Gavin wants and I don't understand it.
[32:04.410 --> 32:06.490]  I wonder when the last time I had a pucker pie was.
[32:07.210 --> 32:08.650]  What's, is that what that is?
[32:09.130 --> 32:12.450]  Nah, it was like a brand of little tiny pies.
[32:12.450 --> 32:13.650]  Let me see.
[32:14.490 --> 32:15.090]  Pucker pie.
[32:15.650 --> 32:19.830]  I don't want casserole with like a bread crust, which is what that one pie looks like.
[32:20.670 --> 32:22.890]  It looks like there's corn and.
[32:23.050 --> 32:23.070]  What?
[32:23.730 --> 32:24.090]  Beans.
[32:24.290 --> 32:24.730]  Dude, yuck.
[32:24.930 --> 32:26.510]  Fucking yuck a pucker pie.
[32:29.770 --> 32:30.810]  That looks in it.
[32:31.270 --> 32:32.850]  Deceptively good from the outside.
[32:33.390 --> 32:36.890]  You're got, yeah, but wait until, hey, but are you ready to see the inside, Andrew?
[32:36.970 --> 32:37.350]  I'm ready.
[32:38.090 --> 32:38.290]  I'm ready.
[32:38.350 --> 32:39.190]  You're going to get pissed.
[32:39.430 --> 32:40.310]  You ready to be pissed?
[32:40.390 --> 32:40.750]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[32:41.370 --> 32:45.250]  Fuck that, fuck that, that's some bullshit.
[32:46.050 --> 32:49.210]  That is like one of those games where they have to jump in the box.
[32:49.290 --> 32:50.530]  They can't see what it is.
[32:50.710 --> 32:52.510]  That looks delicious on the.
[32:52.630 --> 32:54.110]  What a fucking joke.
[32:54.590 --> 32:55.770]  What a mean joke.
[32:55.890 --> 32:57.350]  They've got cheese, leek and potato.
[32:57.530 --> 32:58.490]  They've got steak and ale.
[32:58.710 --> 32:59.830]  They've got cheese and stuffing.
[33:00.350 --> 33:00.950]  Oh, chicken and stuffing.
[33:01.410 --> 33:03.150]  Dude, this is the craziest.
[33:03.690 --> 33:06.730]  This might be the craziest meal I've ever seen.
[33:06.730 --> 33:12.410]  It's one of those pies and french fries with some, are those peas?
[33:13.170 --> 33:16.490]  Well, peas, you don't forget mushy peas if you're having fish and chips.
[33:17.290 --> 33:18.530]  Mushy peas are a side.
[33:19.030 --> 33:19.150]  Sure.
[33:19.350 --> 33:24.110]  There's nothing better than sitting down with the family, having a little fish and chips.
[33:24.230 --> 33:27.870]  Someone might get a pucker pie and you just eat it on paper on the table.
[33:28.090 --> 33:28.350]  Brilliant.
[33:28.790 --> 33:29.410]  Happy Sunday.
[33:29.730 --> 33:34.730]  You know the problem with the pie, the savory pie, is it looks like you've gutted an animal
[33:34.730 --> 33:36.510]  and the insides are just coming out.
[33:36.510 --> 33:38.150]  Yeah, I agree.
[33:38.530 --> 33:39.130]  Visually.
[33:39.330 --> 33:40.990]  But it's all food that you would eat normally.
[33:41.350 --> 33:43.010]  I know, but it's just chicken or steak.
[33:43.590 --> 33:48.630]  Like, I don't disagree, but there's something about the framing of it visually that is just
[33:48.630 --> 33:49.550]  repulsive to me.
[33:49.550 --> 33:51.170]  I agree. Yes. Yeah.
[33:51.690 --> 33:59.370]  Where you have something like, look, I mean, look at this.
[33:59.430 --> 34:00.330]  That's beautiful.
[34:00.610 --> 34:01.790]  That looks way more gory.
[34:03.070 --> 34:03.490]  What?
[34:04.350 --> 34:05.990]  That looks like a dead animal.
[34:05.990 --> 34:07.030]  It's all blood and...
[34:07.910 --> 34:12.830]  No, the pie above that you're showing, the meat pie thing.
[34:12.910 --> 34:13.210]  Yeah.
[34:13.290 --> 34:17.310]  That looks like you cut into the tauntaun or whatever the fuck that thing in Star Wars is.
[34:17.650 --> 34:19.470]  And you got to make room for heat.
[34:19.770 --> 34:20.910]  Gavin, look at that blueberry.
[34:20.910 --> 34:21.950]  That looks delicious.
[34:22.510 --> 34:25.350]  That's just a bucket of blueberries with shit on top.
[34:26.490 --> 34:29.230]  They've barely been converted to a pie, at least the pumpkin pie.
[34:29.410 --> 34:30.370]  You couldn't see a pumpkin.
[34:30.850 --> 34:35.110]  Right, but isn't that what you just argued about the pucker pie and everything is that
[34:35.110 --> 34:37.690]  it's just what you would eat anyway, but in a pie crust?
[34:38.250 --> 34:39.970]  Yeah, but would you eat a bowl of blueberries?
[34:40.330 --> 34:41.350]  Yeah, absolutely.
[34:42.090 --> 34:42.650]  I did yesterday.
[34:42.650 --> 34:45.190]  I sat down and ate a bunch of strawberries and bananas earlier.
[34:45.330 --> 34:46.070]  What are you talking about?
[34:46.170 --> 34:46.690]  Would you eat?
[34:46.910 --> 34:48.970]  Hey, hey, dude, would you eat a bunch of fruit?
[34:49.610 --> 34:49.870]  Yeah.
[34:50.090 --> 34:50.470]  I feel like...
[34:50.470 --> 34:50.670]  What?
[34:50.810 --> 34:52.870]  I feel like a little pun at blueberries.
[34:52.990 --> 34:54.130]  You're going to be putting them on stuff.
[34:54.210 --> 34:55.410]  They're going to be like decorative.
[34:55.610 --> 34:58.230]  You're not just going to have a bowl, spoonful of tiny blueberry.
[34:58.590 --> 35:00.670]  Wait, is all fruit decorative to you?
[35:01.030 --> 35:01.270]  No.
[35:01.370 --> 35:02.530]  What tiny fruit is?
[35:02.950 --> 35:03.350]  Everything.
[35:03.690 --> 35:05.130]  It's like a bowl of cherries.
[35:05.690 --> 35:07.130]  Cherries are for putting on top.
[35:07.370 --> 35:07.510]  All right.
[35:07.570 --> 35:07.970]  No.
[35:08.250 --> 35:09.930]  For snacking on 50 cherries.
[35:09.930 --> 35:11.090]  I've absolutely eaten bowls of cherries.
[35:11.690 --> 35:12.770]  You must have had the shits.
[35:13.790 --> 35:19.770]  So pumpkin, blueberry and cherry are all just decorations that you can grow?
[35:19.950 --> 35:20.310]  No, no, no.
[35:20.350 --> 35:22.210]  Pumpkin is decoration that you shouldn't even eat.
[35:22.570 --> 35:24.790]  At least with a cherry, you can eat it.
[35:26.130 --> 35:26.690]  I just...
[35:26.690 --> 35:28.850]  I think a meat pie is...
[35:29.610 --> 35:31.090]  Dude, a meat pie is crazy.
[35:31.090 --> 35:32.730]  What about a Christmas with a mince pie?
[35:33.210 --> 35:34.390]  I don't know what that is.
[35:34.390 --> 35:35.030]  I just don't like mince.
[35:35.210 --> 35:35.850]  That's my problem.
[35:35.950 --> 35:37.350]  I don't know what mince is.
[35:38.230 --> 35:39.550]  Mince pie Christmas.
[35:39.970 --> 35:41.030]  Well, that's not my fault.
[35:41.570 --> 35:42.370]  It's a confusing name.
[35:42.410 --> 35:42.710]  Is it sweet?
[35:42.990 --> 35:43.970]  Now, what do you think of this?
[35:44.230 --> 35:44.850]  Ah, shit.
[35:45.150 --> 35:45.890]  Do I want to...
[35:45.890 --> 35:46.070]  That?
[35:46.330 --> 35:46.670]  There you go.
[35:46.790 --> 35:47.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:47.070 --> 35:50.610]  See, that's the most appealing because it doesn't look like it's bleeding out.
[35:50.950 --> 35:51.830]  It's like a fruit.
[35:52.050 --> 35:52.690]  It's fruity.
[35:53.210 --> 35:54.110]  Is it raisins?
[35:54.670 --> 35:55.890]  I don't know if it's raisins.
[35:56.210 --> 35:58.730]  It's usually like fruits of the forest and all that.
[35:58.810 --> 36:00.950]  Like raspberries and blackberries and...
[36:00.950 --> 36:03.170]  So you're fine with that.
[36:03.870 --> 36:07.110]  But for some reason, blueberries is weird.
[36:07.490 --> 36:08.870]  I'm only fine with that at Christmas.
[36:09.810 --> 36:12.770]  Fruits of the forest is such a funny descriptor.
[36:14.450 --> 36:16.310]  Looking at the photo you shared, Gavin,
[36:16.410 --> 36:20.470]  I feel like a child because I realized that if that star crust wasn't on top,
[36:20.730 --> 36:23.510]  it would be infinitely less delicious looking to me.
[36:23.710 --> 36:25.310]  Oh, I totally agree.
[36:25.730 --> 36:26.610]  That star is carrying the entire dish.
[36:26.710 --> 36:27.170]  It's doing...
[36:27.170 --> 36:29.310]  Yeah, the star is doing like a lot of heavy lifting.
[36:29.310 --> 36:36.990]  Uh, I just don't think when you think pie, that's not the regulation pie.
[36:37.110 --> 36:37.990]  No, it can't be.
[36:38.010 --> 36:38.710]  No, it's not regulation.
[36:38.930 --> 36:40.090]  But I think a lot of them are apple.
[36:40.670 --> 36:42.870]  So apple pie would be the regulation pie.
[36:44.230 --> 36:46.470]  Well, are you... wait, are you a fan of apple pie?
[36:47.130 --> 36:47.690]  No, not really.
[36:49.550 --> 36:50.350]  It's fine.
[36:50.430 --> 36:52.070]  I don't like ketchup or mustard.
[36:53.530 --> 36:58.130]  I think if you think pie from like a media perspective,
[36:58.130 --> 37:01.730]  like like a movie, someone's getting pie, it's going to be apple pie.
[37:01.950 --> 37:03.510]  The thing, though, I agree.
[37:03.610 --> 37:05.250]  The problem with setting a regulation...
[37:05.250 --> 37:05.790]  What pie got shagged in that film?
[37:06.510 --> 37:07.550]  Yeah, it is.
[37:07.550 --> 37:08.430]  Oh, yeah, that was apple pie.
[37:08.570 --> 37:09.130]  It was, yeah.
[37:09.790 --> 37:12.150]  Do you ever, um... no, go for it, Andrew.
[37:12.150 --> 37:14.530]  I was going to say the problem was with establishing a regulation,
[37:14.870 --> 37:19.790]  I feel like if we put it at the peak, that lowers all other pies, if that makes sense.
[37:20.030 --> 37:20.870]  Yeah, too bad.
[37:21.250 --> 37:22.990]  Too bad? Okay, that's the thought on it?
[37:22.990 --> 37:26.730]  Yeah, I mean, I mean, to me, a regulation pie being apple pie makes so much sense.
[37:26.870 --> 37:27.050]  Okay.
[37:27.050 --> 37:31.130]  Have you guys ever... you're gonna think I'm nuts, probably.
[37:32.790 --> 37:36.190]  I'm not proposing this to be regulation, I think apple pie should be the regulation pie.
[37:36.630 --> 37:39.330]  Have you guys ever done apple pie with a piece of yellow cheese?
[37:39.410 --> 37:40.590]  No, but I want to.
[37:40.790 --> 37:41.010]  Oh, God.
[37:41.170 --> 37:44.050]  That's something Jeff and I have been meaning to try, is a different thing.
[37:45.490 --> 37:49.070]  He orders it in Taxi Driver, and I remember being in college and going like,
[37:49.150 --> 37:50.770]  that's crazy, there's no way it's good.
[37:50.970 --> 37:53.070]  It's so fucking good.
[37:53.430 --> 37:56.270]  I love a piece of apple pie...
[37:56.270 --> 37:56.570]  Really?
[37:56.570 --> 37:58.270]  ...with a slice of yellow cheese on it.
[37:58.350 --> 37:58.890]  That's insane.
[37:59.050 --> 37:59.170]  It's so good.
[37:59.410 --> 38:00.570]  That is batshit.
[38:00.830 --> 38:01.250]  It's so...
[38:01.250 --> 38:01.710]  That is...
[38:01.710 --> 38:02.530]  Oh, it's so good.
[38:02.950 --> 38:06.950]  It's like Maine, I don't remember, there's a certain state that that is their dessert.
[38:07.350 --> 38:08.630]  Like, that is the state dessert.
[38:08.690 --> 38:09.070]  Oh, really?
[38:09.230 --> 38:11.030]  I don't remember which one it is, though.
[38:11.470 --> 38:14.410]  But I loved it. I was like so impressed by it.
[38:14.730 --> 38:19.390]  I... it adds like a weird creaminess to it that you're not expecting from your pie.
[38:19.610 --> 38:22.090]  And it is like... it's bonkers, I love it.
[38:22.110 --> 38:23.770]  I'm surprised you're not on board for this, Gavin,
[38:23.850 --> 38:25.870]  because I feel like it's adding savory to a sweet.
[38:27.790 --> 38:32.250]  Uh... I would try it, but it doesn't... I mean, let's be honest, it doesn't look good.
[38:32.670 --> 38:35.290]  No, it doesn't. But boy, is it fucking delicious.
[38:35.370 --> 38:37.650]  I would argue it looks better than any of the pies you've posted.
[38:38.110 --> 38:38.630]  That's true.
[38:38.790 --> 38:38.930]  Okay.
[38:39.010 --> 38:41.190]  I haven't posted on my pies. What about a shepherd's pie?
[38:41.890 --> 38:42.670]  Yeah, I don't...
[38:42.670 --> 38:43.190]  No, fuck no.
[38:43.670 --> 38:49.790]  That is... if pumpkin pie isn't pie, that is just simply dog food with mashed potatoes on top.
[38:49.850 --> 38:50.590]  It's lamb.
[38:51.590 --> 38:53.970]  I really like the top half of that.
[38:53.970 --> 38:54.770]  Okay, so...
[38:56.070 --> 38:58.090]  I like this pie doesn't even have a bottom.
[38:58.290 --> 39:02.590]  It's usually just done in a big dish where there's meat and then you just put potato on top.
[39:02.710 --> 39:07.090]  See, that's the problem for me, because I think the crust is like 60 to 70% of a good pie.
[39:07.690 --> 39:07.910]  Yeah.
[39:08.050 --> 39:09.850]  I 100% agree with you.
[39:09.990 --> 39:15.090]  So shepherd's is potentially a crustless pie unless you really crisp up the spud on top.
[39:15.730 --> 39:18.990]  Which I'm a fan of. That sounds great. But it's...
[39:19.610 --> 39:19.850]  No.
[39:19.990 --> 39:21.210]  You know, I don't want to...
[39:22.530 --> 39:24.370]  Do Americans eat peas ever?
[39:25.130 --> 39:25.230]  Yeah.
[39:25.330 --> 39:25.590]  Yeah.
[39:26.410 --> 39:27.270]  Just by themselves.
[39:27.590 --> 39:28.270]  Just not in a pie.
[39:28.430 --> 39:31.190]  Yeah, I think it's just... I think it's just a side of... I think it's just like side of peas.
[39:31.450 --> 39:31.490]  Okay.
[39:31.530 --> 39:34.050]  And then also like... you guys have like mushy peas? We don't do mushy.
[39:35.070 --> 39:36.130]  I'm not a fan of the mush.
[39:36.830 --> 39:37.310]  Oh, is that right?
[39:37.770 --> 39:43.490]  I don't even... like, is it dry? Like, is it a wet mush? Like, is it... what?
[39:43.630 --> 39:45.190]  I don't even understand what a mush is.
[39:45.590 --> 39:46.850]  Let me get you some mushy peas.
[39:49.810 --> 39:54.850]  See, once again, all of... all of the food that Gavin's posting is a mean trick.
[39:54.850 --> 39:57.970]  He's sending the craziest... it's the craziest shit I've ever seen.
[39:58.110 --> 40:01.230]  It's a practical joke where you look at the top and go, that looks great.
[40:01.350 --> 40:03.710]  And then you go in an inch and it's a problem.
[40:04.130 --> 40:06.830]  See, that looks like fucking dried up guacamole.
[40:06.850 --> 40:10.190]  Oh, it's mashed potatoes.
[40:10.510 --> 40:15.110]  It's green mashed potatoes. It's some green... that's some Dr. Seuss mashed potatoes.
[40:15.110 --> 40:19.750]  I would love to lay out, like, a nice, like, fajita meal.
[40:20.190 --> 40:23.330]  And just replace all the ingredients with different British shit.
[40:23.410 --> 40:25.250]  So, like, you go for the guac and it's peas.
[40:26.330 --> 40:29.110]  Oh, so sad. Oh, that's so sad.
[40:29.950 --> 40:30.570]  Okay. Terrible.
[40:30.930 --> 40:33.890]  Well, I feel like we're leaning apple pie, which is...
[40:33.890 --> 40:35.370]  I'm... I think apple pie is the standard.
[40:35.590 --> 40:37.970]  I think apple pie is regulation. I think that's it.
[40:38.050 --> 40:40.870]  Okay. We've locked in regulation pie.
[40:41.490 --> 40:41.750]  Okay.
[40:41.850 --> 40:43.890]  And I think we've... I mean, we're at 40 minutes.
[40:43.890 --> 40:45.490]  Like, it's kind of like...
[40:45.490 --> 40:46.650]  Let's do one more. I want to do one more.
[40:46.750 --> 40:46.870]  Okay.
[40:46.970 --> 40:47.830]  I want to do one more. Yeah.
[40:47.830 --> 40:48.190]  We can either...
[40:48.190 --> 40:49.490]  Because I feel like we're going to finish strong.
[40:49.690 --> 40:51.610]  I picked pie because I knew we were going to argue about it.
[40:52.430 --> 40:54.910]  I had in my notes savory pie as an alternative.
[40:55.550 --> 40:57.210]  But I thought that it wouldn't be needed.
[40:57.610 --> 41:00.730]  And also that Gavin would be the only one that has an opinion on savory pie.
[41:01.710 --> 41:02.030]  Yep.
[41:02.190 --> 41:04.270]  Although, Nick, I bet you fucking... Nick, food free.
[41:04.330 --> 41:05.510]  Oh, I bet Nick is probably...
[41:05.510 --> 41:08.930]  Nick's going to come back and look at the pictures that we posted and he's going to go,
[41:08.970 --> 41:10.670]  Ooh, for like 15 minutes.
[41:11.290 --> 41:12.970]  Yeah, he's going to be like, Oh, what did I miss?
[41:13.030 --> 41:13.650]  Let's do it again.
[41:14.710 --> 41:16.030]  This is his worst fear.
[41:16.250 --> 41:17.610]  He missed the thing about food.
[41:19.150 --> 41:22.230]  We got burgers or action heroes?
[41:23.210 --> 41:24.330]  You want to keep it food?
[41:24.730 --> 41:25.930]  Let's let's keep it food.
[41:26.030 --> 41:26.250]  Okay.
[41:26.470 --> 41:27.790]  Let's go all food this episode.
[41:28.370 --> 41:28.570]  Yep.
[41:28.750 --> 41:29.190]  Burger.
[41:29.630 --> 41:30.050]  Okay.
[41:30.130 --> 41:32.030]  So what I'm like the hot dog.
[41:32.090 --> 41:34.330]  I feel like there's room for conversation about the bun.
[41:35.030 --> 41:36.130]  What type of bun are we talking?
[41:36.430 --> 41:37.610]  We talking a pretzel bun?
[41:37.970 --> 41:39.190]  We talking a brioche?
[41:39.490 --> 41:40.550]  Talking a potato?
[41:40.910 --> 41:41.850]  Or a sesame?
[41:42.250 --> 41:42.910]  A sesame?
[41:42.910 --> 41:47.970]  I, I'm a potato bun guy, but I understand if I agree.
[41:48.210 --> 41:50.010]  I understand if that's not where people land.
[41:50.190 --> 41:55.170]  I am, especially if we're trying to come up with regulation burger.
[41:55.470 --> 41:57.050]  You know, like what is the regulation one?
[41:57.150 --> 41:58.730]  I totally understand if it's not potato.
[41:59.090 --> 42:00.810]  I'm a big potato bun guy as well.
[42:01.330 --> 42:04.250]  I feel like that is the regulation burger bun.
[42:04.410 --> 42:07.270]  That that is, that's more than just regulation.
[42:07.270 --> 42:08.610]  That's like bog standard.
[42:08.730 --> 42:08.990]  Yeah.
[42:09.090 --> 42:10.750]  Like that is truly...
[42:10.750 --> 42:13.490]  It's just the basic white with sesame on it.
[42:13.550 --> 42:13.750]  Yeah.
[42:14.390 --> 42:14.870]  Yeah.
[42:15.550 --> 42:16.510]  Full on.
[42:16.590 --> 42:17.050]  Full on.
[42:17.150 --> 42:17.730]  I hated that.
[42:18.630 --> 42:23.890]  But I, like in the world of bun, in the burger bun technology world,
[42:23.990 --> 42:26.250]  it's like we're going back to the 20s with that.
[42:26.470 --> 42:29.110]  There have been so many improvements over the years.
[42:29.130 --> 42:31.050]  Yeah, but they really, they really nailed it.
[42:31.890 --> 42:36.210]  Is this the regulation hamburger or just burger?
[42:37.250 --> 42:37.970]  Oh, what?
[42:38.070 --> 42:39.110]  I don't even understand.
[42:39.290 --> 42:39.710]  What do you mean?
[42:39.710 --> 42:40.590]  Like a chicken burger?
[42:40.790 --> 42:41.450]  I'm excited to find out.
[42:41.490 --> 42:41.970]  Is that what you're saying?
[42:41.970 --> 42:45.010]  Because if it's regulation burger, I feel like a cheeseburger could be included.
[42:45.250 --> 42:49.610]  If it's a hamburger, you would specify cheese, a cheeseburger if you wanted cheese.
[42:49.730 --> 42:52.530]  In my head, a cheeseburger is always the choice.
[42:52.670 --> 42:53.530]  Like it's such a...
[42:53.530 --> 42:54.290]  That is...
[42:54.290 --> 42:56.110]  Like when I say hamburger, I mean cheeseburger.
[42:56.250 --> 42:56.630]  But you're right.
[42:56.670 --> 42:57.450]  It is technically different.
[42:57.910 --> 43:04.210]  We've talked about this on 100% eat a lot, where Michael has said sort of ad nauseum that like,
[43:04.770 --> 43:07.990]  when you say hamburger, what you mean is cheeseburger,
[43:07.990 --> 43:10.630]  because cheese is the default on a burger.
[43:10.910 --> 43:10.970]  Yes.
[43:11.030 --> 43:12.570]  Like that is what it should be.
[43:12.570 --> 43:13.530]  I think that's backwards.
[43:14.070 --> 43:14.470]  Really?
[43:14.730 --> 43:18.270]  I think if you say hamburger, you mean a burger without cheese.
[43:18.570 --> 43:21.730]  I think you're technically completely right. But I just don't...
[43:21.730 --> 43:26.010]  Yes. But I don't think that that is what people lean toward more often than not.
[43:26.090 --> 43:29.190]  I think the expectation is cheese on the burger.
[43:29.750 --> 43:34.970]  And it's not about getting the... like the wording totally correct.
[43:34.970 --> 43:38.170]  It's that over time, that has become the default.
[43:39.130 --> 43:40.750]  Yeah, I just feel like you would say burger.
[43:40.910 --> 43:41.390]  Cheese on the burger.
[43:41.530 --> 43:42.890]  You wouldn't say hamburger in that case.
[43:43.630 --> 43:47.870]  If I want... if you said we're having burgers, they better freaking be cheeseburgers.
[43:48.470 --> 43:48.870]  Exactly.
[43:49.490 --> 43:52.910]  If you said we're having hamburgers, I'd be like, this would be insane to assume cheese.
[43:53.610 --> 43:55.390]  Okay, so this is regulation burger.
[43:55.850 --> 43:56.010]  Yeah.
[43:56.190 --> 43:58.610]  Let's call this regulation burger because it absolutely has cheese.
[43:58.710 --> 43:59.050]  It's a cheeseburger.
[43:59.050 --> 43:59.530]  Absolutely has cheese.
[43:59.830 --> 44:04.030]  Can I say that the idea that cheese is like an additional thing you pay for,
[44:04.030 --> 44:06.870]  that's like one of the greatest restaurant tricks.
[44:07.110 --> 44:09.010]  Like they pulled the wool over our eyes.
[44:09.410 --> 44:14.130]  It would be like if they paid a premium for salt on fries is the equivalency.
[44:14.370 --> 44:16.530]  Like it's such a... it's unique.
[44:17.670 --> 44:19.890]  Okay, so we're doing poppy seed.
[44:19.950 --> 44:23.150]  I'm fine with, as I said, like I would never opt for that.
[44:23.230 --> 44:23.930]  But I do agree.
[44:24.490 --> 44:24.790]  That's sesame.
[44:24.970 --> 44:25.250]  Poppy.
[44:25.490 --> 44:25.810]  Sesame.
[44:26.150 --> 44:27.530]  Yeah, that is sesame.
[44:27.610 --> 44:28.530]  Poppy's the black one.
[44:29.230 --> 44:30.070]  It is true.
[44:30.250 --> 44:32.110]  Yeah, I see.
[44:32.170 --> 44:32.670]  That's my outrage.
[44:33.230 --> 44:34.370]  I only like those.
[44:34.550 --> 44:36.770]  See, I like the ones with the poppy seed on them.
[44:36.970 --> 44:38.430]  And it's a little bit darker cut.
[44:38.510 --> 44:40.010]  The bun, like it's cooked a little bit more.
[44:40.090 --> 44:42.250]  That's the that's that's the worst version of this.
[44:42.270 --> 44:42.870]  Oh, I just agree.
[44:42.990 --> 44:44.130]  Poppy seed bun.
[44:44.690 --> 44:44.870]  Yeah.
[44:45.030 --> 44:45.190]  Yeah.
[44:45.350 --> 44:45.950]  A poppy seed.
[44:46.730 --> 44:48.190]  See what the sesame seed is.
[44:48.350 --> 44:52.090]  That's some Burger King shit, Eric, which I'm surprised you're a fan of.
[44:52.410 --> 44:57.570]  This is just when I get a burger at like a cookout or whatever.
[44:57.830 --> 44:58.450]  Like that's it.
[44:58.750 --> 45:00.030]  Like that, that to me is.
[45:01.290 --> 45:01.990]  That's where we're at.
[45:01.990 --> 45:05.690]  Gavin, did you look up poppy seed bun and you're going, why the fuck is he talking about this?
[45:05.910 --> 45:07.770]  I'm seeing it only on like long buns.
[45:08.570 --> 45:09.750]  Oh, yeah, like hot dog.
[45:09.930 --> 45:10.290]  Yeah.
[45:10.590 --> 45:15.010]  Yeah, well, that's like if you want to eat a burger the long way.
[45:20.390 --> 45:25.010]  I wonder if a long Big Mac would be as good as just a Big Mac.
[45:25.310 --> 45:26.550]  I don't think a Big Mac is good.
[45:26.630 --> 45:29.230]  Should we try to make long hamburgers?
[45:29.450 --> 45:29.570]  Sure.
[45:29.570 --> 45:33.210]  Yeah, we should try to make long burgers and see if they're better that way.
[45:33.410 --> 45:34.710]  Oh, are we talking?
[45:35.330 --> 45:39.590]  Is it like are we making burger dogs where it's shaped like that?
[45:39.710 --> 45:40.090]  OK, yeah.
[45:40.230 --> 45:42.910]  And not like smash burgers where it's long, but then extended.
[45:43.510 --> 45:45.690]  We got to try to keep some some.
[45:46.090 --> 45:49.190]  We called those at at Mega 64.
[45:49.390 --> 45:50.570]  I think we called them hot burgers.
[45:51.730 --> 45:57.110]  And then the other one, I think we called
[45:57.110 --> 45:59.370]  uh, hambogs.
[45:59.370 --> 46:02.890]  So that way you wouldn't get too confused.
[46:04.210 --> 46:07.650]  So that way you knew about hambogs and hot burgers.
[46:07.970 --> 46:08.730]  This is the type of bun I'm talking about.
[46:09.630 --> 46:14.210]  I feel like as soon as you said ham, what did you say?
[46:14.290 --> 46:14.690]  Hambog?
[46:15.570 --> 46:16.450]  Yeah, hambogs.
[46:16.470 --> 46:20.350]  I feel like my understanding of like all the visuals in my head just exploded.
[46:20.590 --> 46:23.790]  And I lost my holdings of everything.
[46:23.910 --> 46:25.710]  I just completely lost what we were talking about.
[46:26.050 --> 46:26.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:26.730 --> 46:28.750]  We're talking about hambogs and hot burgers.
[46:32.890 --> 46:34.170]  OK, so we have the bun.
[46:34.670 --> 46:35.250]  We have the core.
[46:35.570 --> 46:36.410]  Cheese, we agree on.
[46:36.570 --> 46:37.310]  But what type of cheese?
[46:37.370 --> 46:38.170]  Are we talking a cheddar?
[46:38.290 --> 46:42.070]  I personally like mozzarella, but I think a cheddar is probably...
[46:42.070 --> 46:45.070]  I think it's just got to be a shitty American slice, isn't it?
[46:45.090 --> 46:46.410]  I think it's I think it's American.
[46:46.550 --> 46:46.830]  It is.
[46:46.850 --> 46:47.830]  I think it has to be American cheese.
[46:47.930 --> 46:48.690]  It's the meltiest.

[47:52.490 --> 47:52.670]  Okay.
[47:52.670 --> 47:58.070]  And say, uh, and I don't think you guys are going to agree, but I guess we'll see where it stands.
[47:58.870 --> 48:04.070]  Uh, onion and tomato are both going on what I think is a standard hamburger.
[48:04.270 --> 48:04.950]  What do you think?
[48:05.630 --> 48:08.450]  Uh, I would say I would have said onion, tomato and lettuce.
[48:08.690 --> 48:08.930]  Yeah.
[48:09.030 --> 48:11.890]  So I think lettuce is fine.
[48:12.210 --> 48:13.810]  I don't think it adds anything.
[48:13.810 --> 48:17.090]  And if I'm say, like, if I have a say in this thing, I'm like, get that.
[48:17.250 --> 48:17.650]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[48:17.770 --> 48:22.430]  I'm fine if you guys want it, but like, I just don't think, I don't think you need it.
[48:22.430 --> 48:25.490]  Lettuce to me is like the, the burger thumbnail though.
[48:25.610 --> 48:29.850]  It's like, it makes it look slightly more appetizing, even though it has minimal impact
[48:29.850 --> 48:30.170]  on the meal.
[48:30.190 --> 48:30.770]  It is the garnish.
[48:30.930 --> 48:31.050]  Yeah.
[48:31.610 --> 48:32.250]  Um, yeah.
[48:32.550 --> 48:35.330]  Although sometimes they can get a little too thick with the lettuce and it's like,
[48:35.330 --> 48:38.350]  I'm eating a salad and it's slimy and I don't like it.
[48:38.490 --> 48:38.690]  Yep.
[48:38.930 --> 48:43.450]  That's where I'm coming from with it, where you get like, someone just gets like the one
[48:43.450 --> 48:47.050]  lettuce leaf and they just throw it on there and it's all slippy and every, and it's just
[48:47.050 --> 48:51.730]  like, no, I want like the bib lettuce, like put a couple of slices on there.
[48:51.730 --> 48:52.370]  It's nice.
[48:52.490 --> 48:56.710]  And it adds like a, a little something to it, but I'm fine.
[48:56.730 --> 48:57.850]  We can have lettuce on this thing.
[48:57.890 --> 48:58.310]  I'm not opposed.
[48:58.430 --> 48:59.090]  I like lettuce.
[48:59.110 --> 48:59.970]  I will say onion.
[49:00.050 --> 49:00.790]  I don't like tomato.
[49:00.930 --> 49:01.850]  That is where I stand.
[49:02.170 --> 49:02.270]  First.
[49:02.390 --> 49:02.750]  Ooh.
[49:02.910 --> 49:06.930]  But I do agree that the tomato I feel like is a part of the burger.
[49:07.810 --> 49:08.170]  Okay.
[49:08.270 --> 49:12.070]  I want, if we're, if we're, it's a little bit of a give and take here, then I want no
[49:12.070 --> 49:12.410]  pickles.
[49:12.810 --> 49:13.850]  Oh, I'm fine with that.
[49:13.970 --> 49:16.030]  Get the fucking, you don't even see them.
[49:16.310 --> 49:17.190]  Get them out of there.
[49:17.390 --> 49:17.630]  No.
[49:18.130 --> 49:20.810]  I hate them, but I feel like, uh, stuff like a Big Mac.
[49:20.810 --> 49:21.570]  I hate pickles.
[49:22.270 --> 49:23.370]  Oh, you hate gherkins.
[49:23.390 --> 49:25.490]  Oh, I hate pickles.
[49:25.870 --> 49:28.510]  How the fuck do you hate pickles, but like Branston pickle?
[49:29.130 --> 49:30.310]  How is this possible?
[49:30.790 --> 49:33.470]  It's not like Branston has other pickle shit.
[49:33.690 --> 49:34.370]  It's like onion.
[49:34.730 --> 49:36.050]  It's, it's other shit.
[49:36.190 --> 49:38.130]  There are no pickles in Branston pickle.
[49:38.870 --> 49:39.030]  Yeah.
[49:39.370 --> 49:40.490]  There has to be pickles.
[49:40.670 --> 49:41.450]  It's not all cucumber.
[49:42.310 --> 49:43.510]  I, it's insane.
[49:43.750 --> 49:45.230]  That is an insane taste preference.
[49:45.290 --> 49:46.550]  I'm with Gavin on this.
[49:46.670 --> 49:50.370]  I, I pickle my own onions at home and they go on like everything.
[49:50.370 --> 49:51.250]  Totally fair.
[49:51.630 --> 49:52.230]  Yeah, absolutely.
[49:52.470 --> 49:56.710]  Like, I just think pickles are, I think pickles, the actual pickle is vile.
[49:56.810 --> 49:59.770]  I think it's stupid to call something a process.
[50:00.390 --> 50:00.710]  Okay.
[50:01.190 --> 50:01.750]  I agree.
[50:03.010 --> 50:08.450]  Unless we change, unless we change the name of beer to fermentation, then I'm okay with it.
[50:09.090 --> 50:10.470]  I'm just trying to wrap my head around.
[50:10.550 --> 50:14.150]  Cause I agree with everything you're saying, but the fact you love Branston pickles is really
[50:14.150 --> 50:15.250]  what holds me up.
[50:15.250 --> 50:15.850]  It's a different veg.
[50:16.190 --> 50:16.750]  It's different.
[50:17.150 --> 50:19.270]  No, but that's a jar of pickle, right?
[50:19.350 --> 50:20.070]  It's not a pickle.
[50:20.070 --> 50:21.990]  But there are pickles in Branston pickle.
[50:22.430 --> 50:25.030]  They're a small part of the pie, but it's all different.
[50:25.170 --> 50:27.550]  It's all like obliterated by the pickling process.
[50:27.670 --> 50:30.010]  Yeah, Gavin, Gavin can tell you all about different kinds of pie.
[50:30.230 --> 50:30.530]  I'll say.
[50:30.590 --> 50:35.470]  So wait, if it was a pickled pickle, would you be, would you enjoy that?
[50:36.190 --> 50:37.130]  What do you mean a pickle pickle?
[50:37.290 --> 50:37.970]  What are you talking about?
[50:38.030 --> 50:38.770]  A cucumber, you mean?
[50:38.790 --> 50:41.150]  Well, if you pickle a pickle, if you pickle a cucumber.
[50:41.150 --> 50:41.610]  What are you talking about?
[50:41.650 --> 50:42.050]  Pickle a pickle.
[50:42.210 --> 50:43.310]  If you pickle a cucumber.
[50:43.670 --> 50:44.090]  Silly bollocks.
[50:46.350 --> 50:48.150]  Boys, boys, save it for the podcast.
[50:50.070 --> 50:51.990]  Like a spoonful of pickle.
[50:52.090 --> 50:52.650]  It looks like that.
[50:52.770 --> 50:53.870]  Oh, that's awful.
[50:55.110 --> 50:57.210]  That looks like more dog food.
[50:57.470 --> 50:59.310]  It looks like stuff you feed a dog.
[50:59.570 --> 51:01.490]  Why is it next to a piece of like rolled ham?
[51:01.890 --> 51:03.390]  What's happening in this picture?
[51:03.630 --> 51:05.350]  They're probably cooking up a lovely plowman.
[51:07.110 --> 51:10.170]  Stop, stop finding plowmans everywhere too.
[51:10.510 --> 51:11.190]  It's been terrible.
[51:11.710 --> 51:16.870]  I went to Waitrose yesterday and I bought a plowman sandwich.
[51:19.210 --> 51:22.730]  But that's like, that's like an original plowman's lunch, probably.
[51:22.890 --> 51:25.470]  Just like a layout of all the different stuff.
[51:25.690 --> 51:30.970]  That spoon, that looks like you have, I don't know, like, like the plague or something.
[51:31.090 --> 51:31.890]  And that's the cure.
[51:32.030 --> 51:33.810]  That's the remedy that they're trying to give you.
[51:34.350 --> 51:37.570]  I like cubes of glistening sludge.
[51:37.750 --> 51:38.370]  What could I say?
[51:38.730 --> 51:39.830]  Yeah, you definitely do.
[51:39.950 --> 51:41.010]  Anyway, back on topic.
[51:41.030 --> 51:41.410]  Oh my god.
[51:41.810 --> 51:44.010]  Okay, so that looks great.
[51:44.130 --> 51:45.410]  I just sent an image of a burger.
[51:45.930 --> 51:46.850]  That to me is, that looks great.
[51:47.450 --> 51:48.310]  Here's the thing.
[51:49.050 --> 51:51.730]  Condiment wise on the bottom here, it looks like it might be ketchup or something.
[51:51.890 --> 51:56.230]  I think if there's going to be a condiment, it should probably be Thousand Island.
[51:56.690 --> 51:57.050]  No.
[51:57.570 --> 51:57.930]  No.
[51:58.750 --> 51:59.030]  No.
[51:59.450 --> 52:00.050]  Are you an idiot?
[52:00.210 --> 52:01.830]  No, we're not doing Thousand Island.
[52:03.650 --> 52:04.650]  That's an insane...
[52:04.650 --> 52:05.610]  What should be on it?
[52:06.070 --> 52:08.390]  Like, I see, I don't like the Big Mac at all.
[52:08.470 --> 52:09.830]  I'm not a fan of the Thousand Island.
[52:10.210 --> 52:14.370]  I'm okay with like a mayo, like an aioli or a mayo.
[52:14.750 --> 52:15.230]  I'm fine with a mayo.
[52:15.470 --> 52:16.230]  I can live with a mayo.
[52:16.850 --> 52:18.690]  I don't love it, but I can live with a mayo.
[52:18.830 --> 52:21.810]  I typically would do, I don't, yeah, I don't know.
[52:22.390 --> 52:25.010]  Mustard feels weird to me on that, but so does ketchup.
[52:25.150 --> 52:29.110]  I don't typically, it's not a burger I would typically eat, but it looks very appetizing.
[52:31.190 --> 52:34.110]  I think we got to go aioli or like a mayo or something.
[52:34.210 --> 52:36.590]  Yeah, I think mayo, I think mayo is fair.
[52:36.750 --> 52:37.470]  Gavin, what do you think?
[52:38.010 --> 52:39.710]  Probably go ketchup over mayo, to be honest.
[52:39.770 --> 52:40.310]  What about an aioli?
[52:40.770 --> 52:41.950]  What about like a garlic aioli?
[52:42.670 --> 52:44.250]  Yeah, I mean, that just depends.
[52:44.930 --> 52:46.610]  That's how fancy the burger is, right?
[52:46.610 --> 52:51.730]  If I'm making these on my grill, I'm probably just slinging some ketchup in it.
[52:52.250 --> 52:52.430]  Yeah.
[52:52.610 --> 52:56.490]  But I would rather have an aioli of some sort.
[52:56.890 --> 53:01.610]  Now, here's where I can, I'll say aioli's fine.
[53:01.850 --> 53:03.870]  I think that that's just dressed up mayonnaise.
[53:04.110 --> 53:04.910]  I don't mind it.
[53:05.030 --> 53:05.470]  It's fine.
[53:07.090 --> 53:11.830]  If we're doing the style of hamburger, I will always go smash burger.
[53:12.630 --> 53:13.350]  Ooh, yeah.
[53:13.730 --> 53:15.970]  I'm a big, yeah, I like a smash burger.
[53:16.810 --> 53:18.090]  I love it.
[53:18.390 --> 53:19.810]  I love that type of...
[53:19.810 --> 53:24.950]  If the burgers are squashed like that and the bread's all mushy and it's wrapped in a bag
[53:24.950 --> 53:28.170]  that's gone transparent because of all the grease, I hate it.
[53:28.870 --> 53:29.430]  Really?
[53:29.830 --> 53:32.130]  That is like so my preferred burger.
[53:32.670 --> 53:34.330]  Like that picture that I sent?
[53:34.610 --> 53:37.110]  No, the one that I sent?
[53:37.290 --> 53:37.810]  Oh, my God.
[53:38.010 --> 53:39.250]  Like, give me that now.
[53:39.470 --> 53:40.230]  I'll eat 10.
[53:40.610 --> 53:43.010]  You're going to have such wet hands after.
[53:43.010 --> 53:48.090]  Yeah, and I will suffer those blows to eat that burger.
[53:48.090 --> 53:52.130]  And if you're wearing long sleeves, chances are when you're holding it upright towards
[53:52.130 --> 53:54.490]  the mouth, it's going to go down your damn sleeves, all that juice.
[53:55.410 --> 53:56.270]  That's a good point.
[53:56.630 --> 53:57.410]  Here's the problem.
[53:57.650 --> 54:01.870]  I feel like we're too late to swap to a smash burger because I would change the design of
[54:01.870 --> 54:02.370]  all the...
[54:02.370 --> 54:06.390]  Like, everything structurally is different to me if we're going to smash.
[54:06.670 --> 54:07.550]  I don't want anything.
[54:07.830 --> 54:08.470]  I don't want lettuce.
[54:08.650 --> 54:09.330]  I don't want tomato.
[54:09.850 --> 54:10.930]  I'm purely there for the...
[54:10.930 --> 54:15.010]  What about something that's a little thicker than a smash burger?
[54:15.490 --> 54:16.770]  See, that looks fine to me.
[54:17.090 --> 54:17.950]  Okay, okay.
[54:18.070 --> 54:19.370]  So something that's a little bit thicker.
[54:19.510 --> 54:20.190]  I just don't...
[54:20.190 --> 54:21.630]  I'm so over...
[54:21.630 --> 54:29.330]  My whole life was eating these thick hamburger puck things that were just never...
[54:30.050 --> 54:30.530]  Sure.
[54:30.710 --> 54:32.750]  ...all together, like, came out right.
[54:32.750 --> 54:34.250]  Yeah, dry, some pieces of moist.
[54:34.250 --> 54:39.530]  I just always go for a thinner burger because, to me, it's cooked better all the way through.
[54:39.810 --> 54:40.530]  I'm fine with that.
[54:40.530 --> 54:41.970]  Yeah, let's...
[54:41.970 --> 54:44.210]  Do we just clarify it's not a giant meat patty?
[54:44.310 --> 54:45.370]  Just, like, a small...
[54:45.370 --> 54:45.630]  Yes.
[54:45.630 --> 54:47.970]  Like, a normal-sized, not insane...
[54:49.250 --> 54:51.850]  ...because that works for me.
[54:52.050 --> 54:55.070]  I think it's just something on the thinner side, but not, you know, a big fat...
[54:55.070 --> 54:55.990]  Now, you said...
[54:55.990 --> 54:58.930]  You described aioli as just mayo in a disguise.
[54:59.290 --> 55:00.570]  That's what I need for my mayo.
[55:00.730 --> 55:02.050]  I can't handle...
[55:02.050 --> 55:02.170]  Okay.
[55:02.210 --> 55:07.950]  I fucking hate mayo, but if I don't know it's there or I don't see it, I like it a lot.
[55:08.410 --> 55:09.230]  But I can't...
[55:09.230 --> 55:12.410]  I'm pretty sure he said dressed-up mayo, not mayo, like, wearing a mask.
[55:12.410 --> 55:13.630]  Whatever, I didn't remember.
[55:13.830 --> 55:17.990]  I just knew the idea was that it was mayo fancied up, and that's what I need for my mayo.
[55:18.010 --> 55:18.570]  It is.
[55:18.590 --> 55:20.090]  I can't just have base mayo.
[55:20.490 --> 55:24.830]  If I do have it, I need it to be hidden in the dish, and then I'll be fine.
[55:25.030 --> 55:25.910]  What about salad cream?
[55:28.430 --> 55:29.230]  I don't...
[55:29.750 --> 55:34.970]  Honestly, when I did the Branston popsicle thing, that was so bad that it has, like,
[55:35.110 --> 55:38.650]  overtaken all the other flavors that I've tried that you've recommended.
[55:38.650 --> 55:39.670]  Over the years.
[55:39.830 --> 55:40.890]  So I don't remember if I...
[55:40.890 --> 55:44.210]  You never had normal Branston in a normal situation, though.
[55:44.430 --> 55:45.010]  Did I not?
[55:45.110 --> 55:47.330]  Did I not just have hot Branston?
[55:47.410 --> 55:48.370]  I think I did, didn't I?
[55:48.950 --> 55:49.410]  It's not...
[55:49.410 --> 55:50.230]  Why would you have it hot?
[55:50.450 --> 55:50.730]  Hot?
[55:51.130 --> 55:51.950]  Oh, no, Branston pickle.
[55:52.170 --> 55:52.870]  No, sorry.
[55:52.950 --> 55:55.430]  I'm thinking the whatever, the meat.
[55:55.750 --> 55:56.130]  Bovril.
[55:56.970 --> 55:57.630]  That's what I was thinking.
[55:58.390 --> 56:03.530]  When I had the Bovril popsicle, that's really, like, that was such a bad experience that...
[56:04.230 --> 56:06.530]  Yeah, you salad cream the Bovril.
[56:06.970 --> 56:09.190]  But I think I had Bovril normally as well.
[56:09.410 --> 56:11.290]  But did you have Branston pickle normally?
[56:11.370 --> 56:11.850]  I can't even remember.
[56:12.090 --> 56:13.010]  Yeah, I had it on toast.
[56:13.110 --> 56:14.390]  I had it the way that you suggested.
[56:14.530 --> 56:15.570]  I had it on, like, a...
[56:15.570 --> 56:15.890]  Toast?
[56:16.130 --> 56:18.070]  I had it on bread with cheese or something.
[56:18.510 --> 56:19.370]  Oh, yeah, cheese sandwich.
[56:19.550 --> 56:19.870]  Classic.
[56:20.490 --> 56:21.790]  I followed your instructions.
[56:22.070 --> 56:23.330]  I can't believe you had it on toast.
[56:23.430 --> 56:23.930]  There was cheese.
[56:24.090 --> 56:25.010]  Oh, then fuck yeah.
[56:25.190 --> 56:25.910]  Well, it wasn't toast.
[56:26.030 --> 56:27.510]  It should have just been bread and cheese and Branston.
[56:27.510 --> 56:27.850]  No, no, it wasn't toasted.
[56:28.230 --> 56:29.610]  I just, it was a long time ago.
[56:29.670 --> 56:32.170]  I remember, though, I specifically asked you, how do I eat this?
[56:32.430 --> 56:34.050]  Because I wanted a fair testing.
[56:34.710 --> 56:35.610]  Was not a fan.
[56:35.610 --> 56:39.290]  I think salad cream I was okay with, but it's sort of just gross.
[56:42.250 --> 56:43.630]  Anyway, I need an aioli.
[56:43.770 --> 56:44.670]  I want a garlic aioli.
[56:44.850 --> 56:45.550]  Would be my preference.
[56:45.730 --> 56:46.150]  I understand.
[56:46.390 --> 56:46.870]  That's fine.
[56:47.050 --> 56:47.330]  I can.
[56:47.470 --> 56:48.350]  I'm totally fine with that.
[56:48.350 --> 56:49.530]  I need that disguise on that mayo.
[56:50.130 --> 56:50.410]  Okay.
[56:50.650 --> 56:52.610]  But is that part of the regulation burger, though?
[56:52.610 --> 56:53.690]  You think it's going to be aioli?
[56:53.970 --> 56:55.370]  Well, we get to set the regulation.
[56:55.950 --> 56:57.910]  That's why I'm trying to get it over to Thousand Island.
[56:58.030 --> 56:59.050]  A very acceptable thing.
[56:59.230 --> 56:59.700]  There's no...
[57:00.290 --> 57:03.410]  Thousand Island, I feel like, is weirder than a garlic aioli.
[57:04.010 --> 57:04.650]  You're nuts.
[57:04.650 --> 57:07.470]  I feel like Thousand Island is just very American.
[57:07.850 --> 57:09.390]  See, maybe that is...
[57:09.510 --> 57:10.330]  That could just be...
[57:10.330 --> 57:13.050]  Yeah, for me, I've never experienced that outside of McDonald's.
[57:14.010 --> 57:14.550]  I'm right.
[57:14.650 --> 57:15.050]  It's okay.
[57:15.170 --> 57:16.770]  But we can go garlic aioli or whatever.
[57:16.990 --> 57:17.250]  That's fine.
[57:17.350 --> 57:17.770]  Do we need...
[57:17.770 --> 57:18.970]  Is there anything else that we're missing?
[57:19.110 --> 57:19.770]  No pickle?
[57:19.910 --> 57:20.610]  Are we all in agreement?
[57:20.690 --> 57:21.090]  No pickle?
[57:21.210 --> 57:22.130]  I feel good about...
[57:22.130 --> 57:22.690]  With the onion?
[57:22.830 --> 57:23.950]  I feel good about what we got.
[57:23.970 --> 57:24.230]  I'm honest.
[57:24.310 --> 57:27.830]  I'm looking at that first burger you posted and I'm imagining it being a little less thick,
[57:27.930 --> 57:28.550]  but like five.
[57:28.990 --> 57:29.830]  That's a good looking burger.
[57:29.830 --> 57:31.430]  I mean, that's it to me.
[57:31.750 --> 57:33.250]  It's that image of that burger.
[57:33.250 --> 57:36.150]  But two patties, a little less.
[57:36.270 --> 57:39.310]  I got a little wrinkle I'd like to throw in as a personal preference.
[57:39.630 --> 57:40.250]  Looking at it.
[57:40.610 --> 57:42.670]  What if we swap the onion with onion ring?
[57:43.030 --> 57:44.090]  How do we feel about that?
[57:44.930 --> 57:46.730]  I like the cold, crunchy onion.
[57:47.210 --> 57:47.550]  Me too.
[57:47.630 --> 57:48.730]  I think it's too specialized.
[57:49.350 --> 57:49.610]  Fair enough.
[57:49.670 --> 57:54.950]  The fried part of the onion ring can often sit too long and absorb too much and become soggy itself.
[57:55.250 --> 57:56.730]  Are we getting any bacon in this thing?
[57:57.510 --> 57:59.130]  I don't think it's a part of the regulation.
[57:59.390 --> 57:59.510]  No.
[57:59.550 --> 57:59.790]  Okay.
[57:59.930 --> 58:01.270]  No, not as part of the regulation.
[58:01.270 --> 58:01.570]  Okay.
[58:01.690 --> 58:06.610]  So the regulation burger is just a standard sesame seed.
[58:06.870 --> 58:07.710]  But oh, that was burp.
[58:07.770 --> 58:08.810]  A sesame seed bun.
[58:11.130 --> 58:18.070]  Lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, basic burger and a garlic aioli.
[58:19.190 --> 58:19.950]  I think that's it.
[58:20.050 --> 58:20.270]  Wow.
[58:20.410 --> 58:22.730]  I think that's what an episode we locked in.
[58:22.910 --> 58:23.810]  So this is great.
[58:23.890 --> 58:26.110]  I think this I think this is such a good idea.
[58:26.310 --> 58:28.890]  And now we're never going to hear the fucking end of it from Jack.
[58:29.690 --> 58:33.130]  We just went through a bunch of foods, made decisions without him.
[58:33.150 --> 58:34.610]  And he's going to have a lot to say.
[58:34.630 --> 58:35.230]  Well, we got a majority.
[58:35.410 --> 58:39.590]  And so, you know, the regulation company, we have a majority system for all of our decisions.
[58:39.650 --> 58:40.710]  It's too bad he wasn't here.
[58:41.270 --> 58:41.870]  He was invited.
[58:42.050 --> 58:47.610]  But do you really think that people, when they think of a regulation burger, will put garlic aioli?
[58:48.290 --> 58:48.410]  Yeah.
[58:48.510 --> 58:51.050]  No, again, I think it's Thousand Island, but you guys won't listen.
[58:51.270 --> 58:51.970]  I think it's ketchup.
[58:52.510 --> 58:53.170]  It's not ketchup.
[58:53.750 --> 58:54.650]  Eric hates ketchup.
[58:55.490 --> 58:57.350]  I think it's a compromise, Gavin.
[58:57.510 --> 58:58.770]  We're coming to a compromise here.
[58:58.770 --> 59:00.490]  I think this is a world in which we're all happy.
[59:01.210 --> 59:02.330]  Are you not happy with it?
[59:02.770 --> 59:03.610]  I mean, I would eat that.
[59:03.690 --> 59:06.810]  But I'm just saying a lot of people are just like, oh, let's make burgers tonight.
[59:06.930 --> 59:08.010]  Yeah, I'll get the buns.
[59:08.130 --> 59:09.370]  I'll get the, you know, the meat.
[59:09.630 --> 59:11.110]  And then it's just whatever you have in the fridge.
[59:11.190 --> 59:12.930]  And what you have in the fridge is probably going to be ketchup.
[59:13.210 --> 59:15.770]  It's probably not going to be Thousand Island or garlic aioli.
[59:16.270 --> 59:17.530]  I got Thousand Island in the fridge.
[59:17.590 --> 59:18.790]  I got garlic aioli in the fridge.
[59:19.610 --> 59:19.990]  All right.
[59:20.450 --> 59:21.170]  All right, I'm wrong.
[59:21.430 --> 59:22.530]  No, I don't think you're necessarily wrong.
[59:22.810 --> 59:25.810]  But if you feel strongly, I mean, we could hash it out more.
[59:25.870 --> 59:27.410]  But I just, I felt like we had a good compromise.
[59:27.410 --> 59:29.950]  No, I think I think we landed on it.
[59:29.990 --> 59:30.450]  I think we're OK.
[59:30.550 --> 59:31.310]  We landed on it.
[59:31.730 --> 59:32.150]  All right.
[59:32.370 --> 59:33.310]  Because I love ketchup.
[59:33.410 --> 59:35.970]  But like, listen, if you want to go ketchup, I would go.
[59:36.070 --> 59:38.210]  But I think garlic aioli is the thing.
[59:39.390 --> 59:39.910]  All right, for me.
[59:39.990 --> 59:41.790]  OK, well, we got the burger locked in.
[59:41.850 --> 59:43.230]  We got what do we got?
[59:43.290 --> 59:44.190]  Hot dog locked in.
[59:44.230 --> 59:45.390]  We got pie locked in.
[59:45.950 --> 59:46.590]  French fry.
[59:46.750 --> 59:47.350]  It's crazy.
[59:48.190 --> 59:48.410]  The first.
[59:48.550 --> 59:49.670]  OK, so let's just go through it all.
[59:50.170 --> 59:50.790]  Hot dog.
[59:51.870 --> 59:52.190]  Bun.
[59:52.290 --> 59:52.830]  Plain bun.
[59:53.450 --> 59:54.090]  Normal dog.
[59:54.750 --> 59:56.970]  Ketchup and a mustard of your choice.
[59:57.410 --> 59:58.050]  Any variety.
[59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.130]  French fry is like the standard cut fry with salt.
[01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.970]  Very basic.
[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.090]  Like, I think that's an easy, very accessible thing.
[01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:07.010]  Then we got pie, which is apple pie.
[01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.910]  Once again, I feel incredibly accessible.
[01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:10.710]  My personal favorite pie.
[01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:11.770]  Very excited about that.
[01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:17.810]  And the burger is sesame seed, lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese.
[01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:19.350]  Garlic aioli.
[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.550]  What a meal.
[01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:21.870]  What a cookout.
[01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:22.430]  Garlic.
[01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:23.910]  Garlic aioli, Gavin.
[01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:24.970]  Garlic aioli.
[01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:27.210]  Listen, Eric, you wanted to be ketchup.
[01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.010]  I'll fight on the ketchup trail.
[01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:30.670]  No garlic aioli.
[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:31.930]  It is maybe lock that in.
[01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.230]  Thank you.
[01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:36.110]  Is that sold as is there like a Heinz garlic?
[01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:37.170]  Yeah, there is.
[01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.230]  Absolutely is.
[01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:39.270]  Show it to me.
[01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:40.110]  OK, one sec.
[01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:41.970]  OK, find a photo of it.
[01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:47.490]  Do you see that Heinz just did the 15 dressings in one as like a promotion?
[01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:48.930]  Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.850]  Everything dressing.
[01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:51.710]  Damn, I might buy this.
[01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:53.510]  Oh, wow.
[01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:54.170]  It's awesome.
[01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.590]  I might.
[01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:55.430]  Yeah, that's what I have.
[01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.870]  I might.
[01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:56.390]  It's great.
[01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:57.330]  Yeah, I might buy that.
[01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:01.090]  That looks fucking that that genuinely looks really good.
[01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.290]  I might.
[01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:01.730]  It's good.
[01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:03.350]  I think I should start keeping this on hand.
[01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.850]  You should.
[01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:04.490]  Yeah, me too.
[01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.950]  I might.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.190]  Our lives might be different from this point on.
[01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:08.970]  That's pretty interesting.
[01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.830]  See, that's like I don't know what you're imagining, but that is what I have.
[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:15.590]  It's just a squeeze bottle of Heinz aioli.
[01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:17.570]  I think that's just really fancy.
[01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.710]  I just I just didn't grow up in that kind of household.
[01:01:19.930 --> 01:01:20.250]  Oh, totally.
[01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:20.650]  Me neither.
[01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:21.070]  I agree.
[01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.170]  Yeah, this is something I like have recently gotten into.
[01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.810]  I think it's a relatively new product for them as well.
[01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.430]  But it's delicious.
[01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:33.570]  And we applied, we set new regulations, new standards.
[01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:35.850]  We have we have a rule we have set up.
[01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:38.770]  I can't, as you said, Eric, can't wait to hear Jeff's reaction,
[01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:43.450]  especially to learning that we have a regulation hot dog and burger and all that stuff.
[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:44.930]  Thank you so much for listening.
[01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:49.090]  If you have stuff that you would like us to set regulations on,
[01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.710]  feel free to list that in the comments of wherever you're absorbing this.
[01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.290]  And check out our Patreon.
[01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.930]  And just to be clear with with us regulating stuff and the regulation thing,
[01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:00.190]  what's the goal?
[01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.490]  Is it so that it's if we're setting a regulation?
[01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:03.910]  Yeah.
[01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.350]  If they want to have a regulation, I'll have the burger.
[01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:06.750]  Yeah.
[01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:07.950]  They now know what it is.
[01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:08.070]  Yeah.
[01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:09.670]  Yeah, they know what it is.
[01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:10.470]  It has garlic aioli.
[01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:11.310]  It has garlic aioli.
[01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.890]  Doesn't have onions on it, which is what I'd be leaning to.
[01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:14.870]  Absolutely insane.
[01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:17.950]  Everybody get Heinz aioli.
[01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:19.570]  I'm not sponsored by Heinz.
[01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:20.810]  Maybe I'm sponsored by Heinz.
[01:02:20.810 --> 01:02:22.370]  Anyway, check out our Patreon,
