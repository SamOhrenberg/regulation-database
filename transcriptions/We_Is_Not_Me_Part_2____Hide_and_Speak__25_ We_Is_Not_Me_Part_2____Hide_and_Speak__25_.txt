[00:15.220 --> 00:22.420]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. This is episode 025. My
[00:22.420 --> 00:27.160]  name is Jeff Ramsey. With me, as always, Nick Schwartz, Andrew Panton, Gavin Free, Eric Baddour,
[00:27.160 --> 00:33.760]  in no particular order. Hello. Hello. Hello. How's everybody been in the last three minutes?
[00:34.320 --> 00:40.800]  Great. Pretty good. How are you in the last three minutes? Good, good. I had a burp and I
[00:40.800 --> 00:44.480]  accidentally swallowed it and now it's just kind of in there and I don't know if it's going to come
[00:44.480 --> 00:50.320]  out. That's like the saddest thing you can do. Do you want to sit on my lap and I'll pat your back?
[00:51.140 --> 00:58.040]  Careful, there's probably shit on it. If we can film it and release it on Patreon,
[00:58.260 --> 01:04.160]  absolutely, because boy, we make a killing. Why would shit be on my lap? Well,
[01:04.440 --> 01:09.540]  weren't we going to do something in Achievement Hunter 100 years ago where I sat in your lap and
[01:09.540 --> 01:14.840]  shit on you? Do you remember that? Yes. Yeah, I can't remember what the qualifier was for doing
[01:14.840 --> 01:20.020]  that. Yeah, but you wanted to just sit on my lap fully clothed and take a dump.
[01:22.700 --> 01:30.120]  Well, for the record, I no longer have that desire. Oh, good. I'm not looking to do that
[01:30.120 --> 01:37.690]  in 2024. Not sure why I wanted to back then. I'm excited to hear Gavin's notes because Gavin
[01:37.690 --> 01:41.130]  earlier in the week said he's pretty excited about his notes. I don't think you want to hear
[01:41.130 --> 01:45.610]  my notes because one of my notes is Andrew is an idiot. No, listen, that's every week.
[01:47.070 --> 01:51.830]  Do you got any notes this week, Andrew? Oh, I got so many notes. I got a few myself. I was in
[01:51.830 --> 01:54.870]  the lab. I came up with some supplemental ideas I want to pitch to you guys today,
[01:54.890 --> 01:59.270]  but let's start. Let's start with Gavin. Why is Andrew an idiot? Oh, let me prepare some screen
[01:59.630 --> 02:06.770]  shots. Oh, fuck. He brought visual aids. Yeah, he doesn't need proof for this trial. It's made
[02:06.770 --> 02:14.570]  the ruling. We put out we put out a little supplemental called Tuned Up. Yeah, a lovely
[02:14.570 --> 02:21.770]  video. Oh, Andrew, let's make his little conversation from the slack. I you know what
[02:21.770 --> 02:27.770]  this is. I feel unwarranted now as I can. We now I see what you're doing here. Is there a way that
[02:27.770 --> 02:34.970]  we can get a dramatic reenactment like Jeff? Nick, you can be Nick. I'll be I'll be Andrew
[02:34.970 --> 02:41.830]  if you want to be Gavin, Jeff. I'll be Gavin. Yeah. OK. Yeah. OK. All right. OK. I'm also I
[02:41.830 --> 02:48.210]  don't have to paste. Yeah, go ahead. I'm ready with the second page. OK. All right. Any preference
[02:48.210 --> 02:54.890]  on game footage I should use for Tuned Up? Nope. Is it Tuned Up a visual thing? The recording of
[02:54.890 --> 03:04.190]  the website. Can we get a second read on that? OK. Is it Tuned Up a visual thing? The recording
[03:04.190 --> 03:10.150]  of the website. Yeah. Sorry, one more. Can we just get just a slightly clearer maybe? OK.
[03:15.970 --> 03:22.610]  Is it Tuned Up a visual thing? The recording of the website. Oh, that's pretty good. Yeah,
[03:22.610 --> 03:29.890]  not the first. The next two are. How would people know what we're reacting to? Sometimes we just
[03:29.890 --> 03:41.830]  I believe I articulated updates every guess. I definitely was mindful of it not being visual,
[03:42.250 --> 03:48.050]  but I'm sure I wasn't perfect in that. I could make those quizzes and just take the screenshots.
[03:51.090 --> 03:53.510]  Did you read that? OK.
[03:55.850 --> 04:01.170]  It's an extra medium and up only release. So I assume the vast majority of people
[04:01.170 --> 04:09.170]  who consume it will be via audio. OK. Now, what I'm referring to is that a lot of the time we
[04:09.170 --> 04:13.130]  would put in a guess for the for the band or whatever, and it would just throw back a bunch
[04:13.130 --> 04:16.650]  of results. And we'd be talking about the results. We were like, oh, you know, reacting to it.
[04:17.030 --> 04:22.310]  But at that point, Andrew had argued his point. And I said, being done with discussing it. OK.
[04:23.570 --> 04:30.430]  Andrew then wrote this. Uh, I haven't listened back to it, but it certainly works as an audible.
[04:34.430 --> 04:41.050]  I haven't listened to it. I never listen to anything that we do. Right. I listen to it.
[04:41.070 --> 04:47.930]  I'm I'm doing, you know, maybe we should have the video. And I get that we didn't record it. Right.
[04:48.190 --> 04:52.790]  But what we could have done, and that was because you you'd never like it when I when I say we
[04:52.790 --> 04:57.970]  should have done this and there's no no no like alternate thing. So I even suggested I'll just
[04:57.970 --> 05:01.710]  type him in. I'll take some screenshots of the exact results. You don't have to type in the same.
[05:01.910 --> 05:08.430]  No, you didn't say that. What? You said we. You said we could. There is no moment of you saying
[05:08.430 --> 05:12.330]  I could do this. If you said I could do this, I would say absolutely. Go ahead.
[05:13.070 --> 05:19.270]  I just met us as a company. Well, you said if you meant we never refers to if it's just
[05:19.270 --> 05:22.010]  just go do it. Just go do it if you think it's a good idea to do.
[05:24.190 --> 05:28.230]  It's not it's it's not just go do it because it's that it's like, you know,
[05:28.310 --> 05:31.210]  will the person editing have enough time to put it in? I want to just do it for no reason.
[05:31.350 --> 05:39.450]  And you said no. Yeah, I didn't say no. I never said no. What did you mean by it's extra medium
[05:39.450 --> 05:43.690]  only? So I assume the vast majority of people who consume it will be via audio. I was giving a point
[05:43.690 --> 05:49.230]  as to why it may not be a big deal. I never said no, don't do that. OK, well, either way, I was
[05:49.230 --> 05:54.330]  putting up a suggestion, a solution to the problem where we could basically refilm it.
[05:55.790 --> 06:01.170]  And then what was the response to the video? There was a lot of all the visual things
[06:01.170 --> 06:06.110]  where it should have been a visual. I've got a series of issues with this. First of all,
[06:06.550 --> 06:10.910]  I already admitted to Gavin he was right. Literally the day it happened and he did
[06:10.910 --> 06:15.590]  not acknowledge it like a little weasel. He just screenshotted all these things.
[06:15.590 --> 06:19.910]  Zero acknowledgement to my comment that he was already right.
[06:20.050 --> 06:24.370]  How does that make me a weasel? This this stuff was already screenshotted.
[06:24.470 --> 06:30.130]  That's a little weasel move. Not reacting, but taking your little screenshots for your bit
[06:30.130 --> 06:33.870]  on the podcast. I'm reacting right here. I'm saving it for the recording.
[06:34.290 --> 06:41.630]  Second of all, I'm not the one who's editing that. This is a public channel, Nick or whoever
[06:41.630 --> 06:51.350]  could anybody else? I never said no. This isn't about me. I gave an opinion and nobody else
[06:51.350 --> 06:55.670]  replied. This is not me. Each of your responses was saying we didn't need it.
[06:56.890 --> 07:01.830]  I was just saying that I don't because you did this what the day before it was supposed to come
[07:01.830 --> 07:09.350]  out. And I was just articulating a point as to why I felt it wasn't necessary. But I never said no.
[07:09.350 --> 07:15.050]  And just because I think something is necessary in the same way that to you, we means also me
[07:15.050 --> 07:20.370]  and anyone can do it. Me vocalizing. I don't think it's necessary. Is it me saying it shouldn't
[07:20.370 --> 07:24.810]  happen? I'm just giving my perspective. I just feel like every response you said,
[07:24.950 --> 07:28.190]  don't worry about it. I'm not going to, you know, if you feel like.
[07:29.290 --> 07:34.350]  But that's just me. There's five of us. What are the people who read it and didn't reply?
[07:34.510 --> 07:37.670]  Just because I'm the only one who replied. I feel like your issue should be with the three
[07:37.670 --> 07:43.130]  other people. Oh, yeah. Get fucking real. I think the three other people were trying to stay out
[07:43.130 --> 07:49.650]  of this fight. A hundred percent. You have to go at it. No. But Jeff, you were in the recording.
[07:49.710 --> 07:53.530]  What did you think? Did you have an opinion? We did it so long ago, I couldn't remember.
[07:53.930 --> 07:57.390]  I was out of town when you had this argument. So I was on vacation.
[07:58.510 --> 08:04.930]  Wasn't an argument. It seemed like an argument. It wasn't an argument. Eric, how did Eric and
[08:04.930 --> 08:09.550]  Nick, how did you guys take it? I voted for it as an argument. Yeah, absolutely. I never viewed
[08:09.550 --> 08:15.990]  it as an argument. That sounds like three votes. It felt like one. The three vote system doesn't
[08:15.990 --> 08:22.310]  work in that context. I only care about Gavin's vote. Gavin, did you think we were arguing?
[08:23.010 --> 08:26.770]  No, I just thought we were having a discussion about the video. I just thought we're talking
[08:26.770 --> 08:33.190]  back and forth about like what that was. But usually I don't chime in unless I feel like
[08:33.190 --> 08:37.870]  usually you don't chime in unless the shirt just came out or it's about to come out
[08:37.870 --> 08:42.350]  and it's too late to do anything about it. I chimed in before the shirt came out and when
[08:42.350 --> 08:50.850]  it was about to come out. Maybe I should chime in less. Right. No, no, no. I think your timing
[08:50.850 --> 08:56.070]  maybe just needs some work, but that's it. I will say it is nice to be on the outside of
[08:56.070 --> 09:02.690]  we is not me part two and seeing just sort of like that's pretty great. It's not just me.
[09:02.690 --> 09:06.950]  I wrote we because if Andrew was like, oh yeah, let's do it. I would have just done it.
[09:07.230 --> 09:14.030]  I will say when we this did just happen a couple of days ago where we had a video that we recorded
[09:14.030 --> 09:19.630]  for the quiet place and Andrew's footage died and he mentioned it and then Gavin was like,
[09:19.790 --> 09:23.010]  let's re-record it. And we all jumped in. We're like, let's re-record it. I'm ready to fucking
[09:23.010 --> 09:27.890]  go right now. Yeah. So I feel like we've take we've learned from the from the first incident
[09:27.890 --> 09:32.350]  and we've already applied that to the to the following incidents. And it seems like we're on
[09:32.350 --> 09:41.450]  the right track going forward. Yeah, I agree. I just don't see how I'm an idiot in this scenario.
[09:41.990 --> 09:46.790]  I was fully on board to be. I'm the fool. I don't think I'm an idiot here.
[09:47.290 --> 09:53.250]  Wait, you're a fool, but not an idiot? No, I'm a general fool, but I don't think what I did in this
[09:53.250 --> 09:58.790]  instance is an example of that. He's a general fool, but not a specific idiot. Yes. What was
[09:58.790 --> 10:03.710]  it Terry Bradshaw said? I may be stupid, but I'm not dumb. Exactly. Yeah. I was mainly
[10:03.710 --> 10:08.770]  fine with with the discussion. I just like at the end, you're like, I haven't listened to it though.
[10:09.670 --> 10:14.390]  Oh, I never listened to any of it. The first thing I listened to is that quiet place thing
[10:14.390 --> 10:18.830]  because I was trying to sink it. I'll just say there's a lot chiming in for someone who hasn't
[10:18.830 --> 10:30.890]  listened. Definitely feels like a fight to me. That's what I'm saying. Not a fight. I was just
[10:30.890 --> 10:35.310]  trying to be helpful. Next time, if I haven't listened, I will not reply, which means I will
[10:35.310 --> 10:41.390]  not reply to whatever the thing is. Well, that's not helpful. No, if you're a member... Now you're
[10:41.390 --> 10:48.490]  driving him away, Gavin. If listening is a prerequisite. Andrew, would you feel better
[10:48.490 --> 10:53.850]  if Gavin apologized? No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have written my note as Andrew's an idiot,
[10:54.110 --> 11:00.690]  but I did want to bring up this frustrating interaction. Maybe the note should have been,
[11:00.690 --> 11:07.110]  I'm frustrated. I think those would be my only notes for this show.
[11:08.790 --> 11:15.610]  My note would be weasel move. Now is the British weasel related to the British jackal? I don't
[11:15.610 --> 11:21.490]  think so. I don't see how it was weasel. Because you didn't ignore the fact that you had this
[11:21.490 --> 11:26.590]  lined up. It was content. I knew it was going to be content. And then if I reacted and blew
[11:26.590 --> 11:31.470]  my reaction in the slack, it's not as good. I wanted to give it to you right here. A little
[11:31.470 --> 11:36.650]  huh? A little just any form of interaction. Because I said all that. And I was like,
[11:36.650 --> 11:41.490]  I guess Gavin just didn't whatever. OK, weird. Zero response from Gavin on that.
[11:42.790 --> 11:50.050]  I don't know if that was weasel either. The fact that you avoided it to attempt to blindside me on
[11:50.050 --> 11:54.410]  the show with Andrew's an idiot. We save stuff all the time for the podcast, don't we? Yeah,
[11:54.410 --> 11:58.930]  the fact that it was Andrew's an idiot and I approached you waving the idiot flag.
[11:59.770 --> 12:06.370]  That's true. I came to you with the idiot flag and you didn't acknowledge it. And then we're
[12:06.370 --> 12:11.250]  quiet for a few days. And then you open with I got a note. Andrew's an idiot. Hey, Andrew,
[12:11.370 --> 12:16.350]  remember that time you waved your idiot flag and I didn't acknowledge it? Let's talk about it.
[12:16.650 --> 12:22.050]  That's true. Andrew did say to me in a in a private message. Where's the screenshot of that?
[12:23.690 --> 12:27.910]  Every single comment of the video version of Chewed Up of people wanting the perspective.
[12:28.770 --> 12:36.690]  It's an army of you being right. I immediately conceded. I feel like we need to make an idiot
[12:36.690 --> 12:41.470]  flag and then somebody has to have it at all times and they have to have it behind them when
[12:41.470 --> 12:46.210]  we record and then it gets granted to the new idiot. Yeah, it's like the reverse Tower of
[12:46.210 --> 12:50.350]  Pimps from Achievement Hunter. It's going to suck to spend $40 every time you have to give it to
[12:50.350 --> 12:56.730]  Andrew. It's just staying with me. It's not going anywhere permanently, I think. You know what,
[12:56.910 --> 13:00.710]  Andrew? You immediately admitted it to me. I didn't. I didn't. I haven't seen the comments
[13:00.710 --> 13:10.970]  yet. So I appreciate how you are ready to be wrong in my face. I listen, I'll be wrong in your
[13:10.970 --> 13:14.890]  face any day of the week. So a lot of people would have kept quiet and I appreciate you.
[13:15.070 --> 13:19.990]  Yeah, listen, I saw it and I knew I figured you might not see it. So I went through the effort
[13:19.990 --> 13:25.870]  of making sure you knew, hey, this opinion I had turned out was wrong. It was the wrong opinion.
[13:26.310 --> 13:34.250]  You're right. Oh, but the next ones will have a video component. Yeah. Although I deleted all
[13:34.250 --> 13:39.330]  my OBS settings in which I did that. Or wait, no, Nick, Nick, you were there. So I didn't need.
[13:39.490 --> 13:48.170]  Never mind. It's fine. We're all good. I'm pretty sure you have it. If not, it's uploaded and it's
[13:48.170 --> 13:53.890]  fine. It doesn't matter. It's in the past. We recorded a lot of stuff. Are you saying you deleted all your recordings?
[13:54.530 --> 14:00.030]  No, I threw out all my OBS footage or settings that I was using to capture my desktop.
[14:00.510 --> 14:06.190]  But didn't you already capture the next two? Yes. I captured one. He did the other. Yes. So you...
[14:06.190 --> 14:11.430]  But I was referencing. I said going forward, they will all be recorded. And then I said,
[14:11.530 --> 14:17.450]  although I just deleted all my OBS settings. Oh, I see. It's a bit circuitous to get there,
[14:17.450 --> 14:22.190]  but I understand what you're saying now. I understood immediately. We're not recording now.
[14:22.470 --> 14:26.450]  You still have time to set it up again. Do you know what the words mean? Going forward?
[14:27.490 --> 14:33.250]  You said going forward, but I just deleted everything. Yeah. Meaning that I will have to
[14:33.250 --> 14:38.070]  figure that out before that is a thing that happens. That doesn't affect the going forward.
[14:38.150 --> 14:43.990]  There'll be video, though. If I if I if I don't have any of the settings in which I recorded the
[14:43.990 --> 14:48.670]  video, how am I going to record the video? We'll set it up. We're not recording right now.
[14:51.750 --> 14:56.950]  Okay. It was just a throwaway point is more. I was just trying to make a little joke about how
[14:56.950 --> 15:04.330]  I had to delete all that coincidentally today for a different thing. Oh, my God. Now I'm annoyed.
[15:04.810 --> 15:09.390]  I for the record, Andrew, I'm 100 percent on your side in that interaction. I totally got what you
[15:09.390 --> 15:14.590]  were saying. Yeah. Crazy. And so did Nick. I don't know why Gavin got real pedantic real fast
[15:14.590 --> 15:19.150]  for for no reason there. No, I thought he was saying that he couldn't do it. Yeah. No, I didn't
[15:19.150 --> 15:23.130]  understand right away. And then and then he had then he parsed it out and I got I got there. I'm
[15:23.130 --> 15:29.450]  with I understand now. Having a vote was understandable. Yes. Yes. There we go. That's
[15:29.450 --> 15:33.430]  three. That's all I needed. We're good. Oh, that's how. Oh, that's the that's the three that
[15:33.430 --> 15:38.910]  you need. OK, I see. Yeah. Yeah. You Gavin team weasel down there. Yeah. I mean,
[15:38.910 --> 15:45.910]  I will say, I mean, the whole we is not me. And then somebody else was like some kind of animal
[15:45.910 --> 15:53.010]  like. I mean, I was really on the outside looking in, man. Oh, yeah. I like that we just had a
[15:53.010 --> 15:56.270]  really pleasant let's play recording where we weren't arguing. We're having a ton of fun and
[15:56.270 --> 16:02.110]  then we came in hot to this one somehow. Somehow. What do you mean somehow? Your opening note was
[16:02.110 --> 16:11.730]  Andrew's an idiot. Somehow you put the fucking directions into the car, drove there and said,
[16:11.770 --> 16:19.530]  I don't know how we got here. Somehow. How did that happen? You called the Uber asshole. Oh,
[16:19.570 --> 16:27.710]  God. You went to the destination you wanted. Andrew, do you by any chance have any notes
[16:27.710 --> 16:34.510]  that say anything like fuck Gavin or Gavin comma weasel or anything along those lines?
[16:35.550 --> 16:40.910]  I don't. I got carrot juice, which I'm not happy about. I bought some to try later. No,
[16:41.010 --> 16:44.990]  I bought some to try later on the show. But you don't have to do. I mean, why wait?
[16:45.750 --> 16:50.150]  Oh, man. But that'll be so unpleasant for the. We're just starting this recording. Yeah. No,
[16:50.170 --> 17:01.220]  I understand what I just said. Yes. Yeah. Do you think he's going to be able to see
[17:01.220 --> 17:07.800]  the dark or what's going to happen? One hundred percent carrot. OK. Three hundred twenty two
[17:07.800 --> 17:14.880]  percent daily value of vitamin A. Why? Why this many? Which one is A? What does that do for you?
[17:14.940 --> 17:22.700]  I don't know. Perishable, keep refrigerated. Anything else interesting on here? Feel good
[17:22.700 --> 17:30.600]  about what's in this bottle. I don't. Vitamin A is retinol. Oh, good for eyeballs. Good eyesight.
[17:33.040 --> 17:36.660]  Oh, yeah. It's all for the eyes. It's an antioxidant. It's good for your hair and skin.
[17:36.820 --> 17:41.740]  And it boosts. Oh, no. And teeth and reproduction. This is great, Andrew. You don't have to eat fish
[17:41.740 --> 17:47.220]  for the rest of the day. I'm not an oxidant guy. I don't trust oxidant. Well, I know. I know. So
[17:47.220 --> 17:51.900]  you want all of this because they're anti that any ox. Well, no, anything that says oxidant.
[17:51.980 --> 17:57.540]  I don't like your anti antioxidant. I'm just any. Then you're just any use of oxidant. I'm not a fan
[17:57.540 --> 18:04.360]  of it. Yeah, no. So he's not anti antioxidant. He's anti oxidant. If I see oxidant, I know I'm
[18:04.360 --> 18:10.660]  not going to like. Well, what you're seeing is the absence of oxidant. You might be pro oxidant.
[18:10.740 --> 18:17.320]  You don't even know. This just smells like carrot, which I don't know what it is. It's 100% carrot.
[18:17.700 --> 18:22.380]  Imagine opening it. It's more like apples. Oh, that would be awesome. I'd be all about that.
[18:23.010 --> 18:27.380]  What are the ingredients to this thing? Probably carrot juice. I got it. I got a couple of guesses.
[18:28.880 --> 18:38.360]  Can't be all carrot. It's 11 and a half carrots in this bottle. It says 11 and a half. Crazy.
[18:39.780 --> 18:45.640]  Holy shit. I could chug 11 carrots. I'm not doing that. But wait a second. Bugs Bunny wishes. Veggies
[18:45.640 --> 18:53.680]  per bottle. Three and a half. Three and a half bottles of servings. So you're about to have three
[18:53.680 --> 19:00.220]  servings of carrot? Probably a quarter of a serving. Dude, your eyesight's about to blast off.
[19:00.740 --> 19:06.540]  Why wouldn't you have the whole thing? It's good for you. Well, this... What day is it today? It
[19:06.540 --> 19:13.000]  expires tomorrow. So we're just sneaking in on this. Is it true that baby carrots are just a
[19:13.000 --> 19:19.280]  cut up carrot? Yeah, I believe that is true. Yes. I'm not seeing the ingredients, which is
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.640]  a little... I think it's just carrot, man. Carrot juice. Yeah, that's it. That's all the ingredient.
[19:23.960 --> 19:31.100]  Okay, here we go. What if we discover that Andrew loves carrots? I think we're about to. Is he
[19:31.100 --> 19:37.340]  gonna chug the whole thing? No, he doesn't have the guts. You know what? You like it.
[19:39.140 --> 19:42.260]  You like it. You know what else is orange? Garfield.
[19:43.560 --> 19:47.600]  A lot of good orange things in your life. Andrew, where'd you go?
[19:50.860 --> 20:01.660]  I gotta say, I don't know how to feel about this. This is baffling. I, as I said,
[20:01.720 --> 20:09.120]  was traumatized by carrot juice as a child. I'm beginning to wonder if maybe it was like
[20:09.120 --> 20:14.080]  vegetable mix juice and it wasn't just pure carrot. Because this just tastes like carrot.
[20:14.420 --> 20:19.460]  This is just liquid carrot. It's a carrot. Jeff, do something.
[20:21.980 --> 20:28.200]  I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do here. It's just carrot. I don't know how you expected
[20:28.200 --> 20:32.140]  it to be anything other than just carrot. You even read the ingredients. So do you think you
[20:32.140 --> 20:37.660]  were traumatized by some sort of vegetable medley? I think so. Maybe a V.A. or something?
[20:37.660 --> 20:45.740]  And it has clouded my vision of just straight carrot juice. Now, would I excitedly buy this?
[20:46.320 --> 20:49.360]  No. What happened with the... what, you choked on it or something?
[20:49.940 --> 20:55.000]  I was trying to chug it and it's a lot to chug. It was... I didn't get far. No, I mean,
[20:55.000 --> 20:59.160]  why were you traumatized by what you thought was carrot? Oh, because I thought it was going to be
[20:59.160 --> 21:04.120]  a juice. I was expecting something sweet. Yeah, it was just a vegetable.
[21:06.980 --> 21:13.560]  That's not unpleasant at all. As someone who loves carrots... So you could do it every day
[21:13.560 --> 21:20.740]  in November? I could. As someone who loves carrots, these carrots are not bad,
[21:21.040 --> 21:26.960]  is what you just said. That's true. I just expected it as a liquid to taste different.
[21:26.960 --> 21:30.340]  As someone who loves carrots, I didn't expect to like carrots.
[21:30.900 --> 21:35.540]  Well, you know, sometimes when you break something down into a juice form, it's not... it doesn't
[21:35.540 --> 21:39.280]  taste the same. Yeah, liquid bacon's not the same as crispy bacon. I got you.
[21:40.460 --> 21:45.380]  It's true. I just don't know. Like this thinking is like, I just don't know what you... I don't
[21:45.380 --> 21:51.300]  know. I just don't understand. I think I may. Well, first of all, as I said, I think it was
[21:51.300 --> 21:58.300]  a vegetable medley, and I think there may be a little bit of that child still in me of
[21:58.300 --> 22:06.680]  vegetables are gross. Like, vegetable juice is gross. Without actually processing that,
[22:06.780 --> 22:10.760]  no, it's just the thing you like. You're an adult. You enjoy carrots. You enjoy vegetables.
[22:11.580 --> 22:16.620]  This isn't bad. This is a lot to take in, though. I couldn't imagine chugging this.
[22:17.180 --> 22:23.640]  How big is it? It's only 450 milliliters, but it feels dense when you're consuming it.
[22:24.340 --> 22:29.120]  Thick. I don't think that most people do chug it. I can't imagine. I wouldn't say that that's
[22:29.120 --> 22:35.900]  the preferred way to drink it. It's probably a sipper, you know? It's really throwing me off.
[22:36.480 --> 22:41.440]  Now I kind of want to see who can chug carrot the fastest. I'll fuck you guys up. Yeah, you will.
[22:41.440 --> 22:46.680]  Of course, dude. I love vegetables. I'm not. I love any. You could drink
[22:46.680 --> 22:54.020]  half a liter of liquid carrot. I don't see. I don't see why not. I'd like to try. I'd like
[22:54.020 --> 22:59.400]  to try. Next time we get together to set stuff on fire with incense, maybe we'll drink some carrot
[22:59.400 --> 23:06.240]  juice. This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to do list

[23:37.920 --> 23:43.440]  serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream, making s'mores with the kids,
[23:43.980 --> 23:49.300]  while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[23:49.780 --> 23:55.940]  That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for the stay.
[23:56.200 --> 23:58.380]  Have we talked about the incense thing on a podcast yet?
[23:58.740 --> 24:00.700]  Yeah. Expensively.
[24:01.500 --> 24:04.980]  Nick said no, Andrew said yeah. Oh, really? That wasn't part of the show?
[24:05.640 --> 24:09.280]  I never know. I guess, you know, listen, I'm wrong. If Nick says no, he's right.
[24:09.860 --> 24:13.760]  What is the incense thing? Wait, you don't know what we're talking about?
[24:14.480 --> 24:16.640]  I'm trying to set it up for you to explain to the audience.
[24:16.940 --> 24:20.860]  That was perfect. That was a perfect setup. That was a really good setup.
[24:20.860 --> 24:22.780]  I thought, Andrew, you did a great job.
[24:24.380 --> 24:26.420]  I realized what you were doing as I was talking.
[24:28.240 --> 24:29.380]  And Gavin's got it in for you today.
[24:29.760 --> 24:36.220]  Eric came in hot and said that there's no way an incense stick could start a fire. I agree.
[24:37.900 --> 24:42.580]  It's going to, like, melt your synthetic carpet, but you're not gonna...
[24:43.620 --> 24:45.460]  We talked about this because I was talking about, like,
[24:45.480 --> 24:47.180]  lighting incense the other day or whatever,
[24:47.300 --> 24:50.040]  because your room smells like cat shit piss or whatever.
[24:50.520 --> 24:52.800]  Yeah, but I said I didn't want to because the cats would knock it over and over.
[24:52.800 --> 24:55.800]  Yeah, yeah, and then it was... and then I think we said, like,
[24:55.840 --> 24:58.160]  what are you worried about, like, it catching on fire? And you said yeah.
[24:58.160 --> 25:00.320]  And then Nick would... yeah, it'd catch on fire.
[25:00.540 --> 25:01.060]  Absolutely not.
[25:01.480 --> 25:05.340]  No, it's not. I don't think it would catch on fire.
[25:05.500 --> 25:10.100]  So we're going to get together at our next live recording and we're going to
[25:10.560 --> 25:13.960]  try to build fire all, uh, fucking survivor,
[25:14.420 --> 25:17.340]  but with incense and see if we can catch anything on fire.
[25:17.500 --> 25:21.200]  But it's a constant ember. If it just sat in carpet for, like,
[25:21.260 --> 25:22.840]  10 seconds, surely it would burn the carpet.
[25:23.120 --> 25:23.640]  We'll find out.
[25:23.660 --> 25:25.840]  It will melt the carpet. I don't think it's going to start a fire.
[25:26.920 --> 25:27.780]  What do you mean it will melt?
[25:28.640 --> 25:29.840]  Let's find out.
[25:30.440 --> 25:33.660]  Yeah, this is all... when do we get... what are you guys doing next Friday?
[25:35.120 --> 25:35.440]  Ooh.
[25:36.740 --> 25:38.120]  Uh, setting the carpet on fire, I guess.
[25:38.140 --> 25:39.820]  Yeah, let's get some carpet and set it on fire.
[25:39.940 --> 25:41.600]  Nick's out of the office, so he won't even get to play.
[25:42.420 --> 25:43.180]  Oh, rats.
[25:43.260 --> 25:43.680]  You'll be fine.
[25:45.340 --> 25:49.740]  Speaking of rats, I got some supplemental content I want to pitch you guys a little bit.
[25:50.160 --> 25:51.780]  What? What is that?
[25:51.880 --> 25:53.380]  Speaking of rats, I have some supplemental content.
[25:53.380 --> 25:56.620]  No, no, I know, but what it... like, what do you mean?
[25:57.180 --> 25:59.500]  What... what rat-related content is not getting...
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.440]  I have two rat-related ideas in addition to two other ideas.
[26:03.520 --> 26:06.720]  Andrew heard that there's rat content and he got sick of the weasel and he's fucking done.
[26:11.560 --> 26:14.620]  Uh, I... the... oh, do you think the carrots... Andrew, did the carrots take you out?
[26:15.520 --> 26:15.840]  Andrew?
[26:16.280 --> 26:17.800]  I'm back. Sorry about that. My internet dropped.
[26:18.940 --> 26:20.480]  We thought maybe the carrots took you down.
[26:20.740 --> 26:22.060]  Yeah, we assumed it was carrot-related.
[26:22.060 --> 26:26.920]  But to sum it up and just to, uh, you know, people are going to post...
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.240]  Here's the thing, like Nick did, here's the thing online that said,
[26:29.320 --> 26:31.480]  don't light this on fire because it'll start a fire.
[26:31.980 --> 26:33.900]  Yeah, things on fire can start a fire.
[26:34.420 --> 26:38.500]  When you... when you burn an incense and then you blow it out, so that way it just goes
[26:39.020 --> 26:42.460]  and it's just like the little wafts of smoke, that's not going to set anything on fire.
[26:42.820 --> 26:44.780]  Why do you think the wafts of smoke come from? It's an ember.
[26:44.960 --> 26:50.680]  And my... listen, and the reason I back Eric up here is because I can't light incense on fire
[26:50.680 --> 26:54.460]  with incense and it's designed to burn. There's no way, there's no way.
[26:54.580 --> 26:58.300]  You can't hold incense to incense and make incense catch on fire when incense is already on fire.
[26:58.480 --> 27:02.140]  So I'm excited to test this out and I'll be happy to be wrong if I am,
[27:02.200 --> 27:03.360]  but I don't think Eric and I are wrong.
[27:03.480 --> 27:07.400]  If you... if you hold incense to petrol, do you think it'll burn?
[27:09.920 --> 27:11.940]  Hold incense to... oh, to like gasoline?
[27:12.240 --> 27:13.260]  Yeah, puddle of gasoline.
[27:14.940 --> 27:22.240]  Uh, I... I don't know. I don't... like, that seems... what an insane thing to have in your house, I guess.
[27:23.540 --> 27:24.060]  Perfect!
[27:24.420 --> 27:27.940]  Here's my bucket of gas and I put it right next to my incense. You did what?
[27:28.820 --> 27:29.120]  Um...
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.160]  If it's... if it's not burning, then what's the problem?
[27:31.920 --> 27:36.420]  No, I'm saying it's not hot enough to catch, like, your normal room on fire.
[27:38.440 --> 27:41.480]  I don't think that I'm out of line here at all.
[27:41.840 --> 27:42.520]  I don't think it's...
[27:43.080 --> 27:46.880]  I don't think... I think that if you are keeping your incense next to your gasoline,
[27:47.140 --> 27:50.480]  you shouldn't be... you shouldn't throw your hat in the ring for this one.
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.100]  Well, I'm pulling out of this conversation.
[27:53.680 --> 27:57.900]  Don't store gasoline and incense next to each other. Everybody knows that.
[27:58.180 --> 28:00.920]  You probably don't store gasoline for very long anyway.
[28:01.340 --> 28:03.000]  Well, if you want to wait for the price to come down.
[28:03.540 --> 28:04.460]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true.
[28:04.620 --> 28:06.000]  What do you do with your old gas?
[28:06.680 --> 28:07.480]  I just drink it down.
[28:08.560 --> 28:10.620]  With the carrot juice? Mix it with carrot juice?
[28:10.980 --> 28:13.400]  Yeah, mix it with carrot juice. I get my... I get my...
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.000]  get my vitamin A and my vitamin G, gasoline, all in one place.
[28:18.120 --> 28:18.900]  Is it still antioxidant at that point?
[28:19.480 --> 28:21.360]  Oh, no, it's... it's pure oxidant.
[28:21.580 --> 28:22.660]  Oh, fuck yeah. Okay.
[28:23.240 --> 28:26.540]  So, Eric, if you feel strong about this, would you...
[28:26.540 --> 28:29.120]  say you left your house for an hour and I'm in there.
[28:29.440 --> 28:29.640]  Okay.
[28:29.660 --> 28:32.740]  And I've got like a hundred incense sticks and I'm just lighting them and
[28:32.740 --> 28:35.400]  blowing them out and flinging them all over. Would you be fine with that?
[28:36.200 --> 28:38.240]  Yeah, I don't... I don't think it's going to catch anything on fire.
[28:38.500 --> 28:39.420]  Oh, wow. Okay.
[28:40.620 --> 28:42.140]  I was not expecting you to say yes.
[28:43.300 --> 28:43.700]  Okay.
[28:44.800 --> 28:48.900]  I'll be like wigging them at the curtains, into the kitchen, towels.
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.580]  I'm not sure... I'm not sure why you would be doing this or what scenario this would exist in,
[28:53.620 --> 28:56.380]  because I'm talking about a real practical scenario where you light incense,
[28:56.920 --> 29:01.500]  put it on your little shelf and then have it be incense in a room.
[29:01.540 --> 29:03.720]  And then a cat knocks it over and then your whole house burns down.
[29:03.920 --> 29:06.960]  That... I think what Eric is saying is that's never, ever, ever going to happen.
[29:07.280 --> 29:08.340]  Yeah, that... that's it.
[29:08.880 --> 29:09.280]  Hmm.
[29:09.520 --> 29:13.060]  The fact that he needs 100 incense to burn your house down makes me feel like
[29:13.060 --> 29:14.540]  he doesn't even believe in your argument.
[29:16.120 --> 29:16.880]  That's a lot of incense.
[29:16.880 --> 29:23.040]  Here's what I need. I need a... I need a drum of gasoline, 100 cats and 1000 incense sticks.
[29:26.280 --> 29:28.360]  Nick is typing when he can just talk.
[29:29.140 --> 29:29.540]  Yeah.
[29:32.080 --> 29:33.260]  Great podcasting, bud!
[29:33.800 --> 29:35.120]  He does it all the time. He types.
[29:35.420 --> 29:35.700]  He does.
[29:36.240 --> 29:38.580]  He is... he is in this argument.
[29:39.120 --> 29:39.900]  That is true.
[29:39.920 --> 29:42.260]  If he... if he gets all the way in, he has to lean forwards, though.
[29:42.400 --> 29:43.020]  Yeah. Yeah.
[29:43.100 --> 29:43.320]  Yeah.
[29:43.400 --> 29:44.680]  Yeah. And he's in this argument.
[29:45.360 --> 29:46.560]  My back's bad now, you know?
[29:49.280 --> 29:50.460]  Whose side is Nick on?
[29:51.220 --> 29:51.840]  I'm on your side.
[29:52.000 --> 29:52.280]  Thanks.
[29:52.880 --> 29:53.520]  Yeah, but...
[29:53.520 --> 29:54.000]  Yeah, you're right.
[29:56.740 --> 30:02.600]  Gavin's just testing to see what level it will take for you to actually change your side.
[30:02.600 --> 30:08.600]  If you... if you leave an incense stick on fire and then just leave, that's probably not good.
[30:09.040 --> 30:13.480]  If you light an incense stick on fire and go and blow out the fire of it...
[30:14.140 --> 30:16.980]  Look, I can already see the Reddit comments on this whole thing.
[30:17.140 --> 30:20.800]  I'm not worried about it. I have my incense. I'm not lighting my house on fire with it.
[30:21.020 --> 30:21.280]  Don't worry about it.
[30:21.280 --> 30:23.880]  I hate to see Team Weasel turn on themselves so quickly.
[30:24.140 --> 30:30.680]  I will say I have lit incense every night in my house, probably since the day I met
[30:30.680 --> 30:34.020]  Emily, because she's big into incense. And when she gets home, you know, she works late
[30:34.020 --> 30:37.060]  at the salon. And so when she comes home, I like to have the house all, like,
[30:37.380 --> 30:41.020]  smelling and looking good for her. And so I always light a little bit of incense for her.
[30:41.260 --> 30:48.140]  And every day of my life for probably seven years, and I have never had even close to an errant issue
[30:48.140 --> 30:53.780]  with incense setting anything on fire or getting out of control or being dangerous in any way.
[30:54.100 --> 30:56.060]  Out of control. This incense is fucking out of control!
[30:56.480 --> 30:57.900]  This incense is out of control.
[31:01.480 --> 31:05.340]  But I want to go back to what I want to know what Jeff's rat content is.
[31:05.600 --> 31:11.580]  Oh, yeah. So I came, I went into the lab the other day. I felt like it'd been a minute since
[31:11.580 --> 31:15.840]  I'd come up with some new ideas. And I've been thinking a lot about supplemental. I've been
[31:15.840 --> 31:20.180]  thinking a lot about getting out and doing stuff in the world. And so I came up with a couple of
[31:20.180 --> 31:25.100]  ideas I wanted to pitch you guys on today. The first one I like, I think Eric will not like
[31:25.100 --> 31:29.160]  it specifically. And I think we won't do it in much the same way. You guys won't let me do the
[31:29.160 --> 31:32.340]  tombstone one. But that's okay, because maybe somebody will make a video game out of it.
[31:32.980 --> 31:38.080]  You guys know I want to go do a show where we walk around the mall, right? I wanted to call it
[31:38.080 --> 31:42.900]  mall walkers. Everybody on earth let me know there's another show called mall walkers where
[31:42.900 --> 31:47.940]  people do that. We won't call it mall walkers. But guess what other people play GTA, we still play
[31:47.940 --> 31:51.820]  GTA, we're allowed to go fucking to a mall and record ourselves, we'll probably still do it in
[31:51.820 --> 31:56.440]  some fashion. But that got me thinking maybe we'll tweak the idea a little bit. Although I do just
[31:56.440 --> 32:00.760]  think us walking around the mall is a phenomenal idea and I'm still on board for it. But I got to
[32:00.760 --> 32:03.800]  thinking what if we just call it something different like mall rats? And I was like, oh, I love that
[32:03.800 --> 32:07.620]  phrase. But then that's like a Kevin Smith thing. And I think he's making a sequel to mall rats,
[32:07.700 --> 32:11.020]  even maybe. And so I don't want to be caught up in the middle of that. So I was thinking like
[32:11.020 --> 32:15.920]  mall brats, right? Because that's like a play on mall rats. But brat summer's over. And I don't
[32:15.920 --> 32:21.100]  want to, you know, I don't want to relive that. So what if instead we have a show where we all go
[32:21.100 --> 32:26.980]  around the mall and I get one of those rubber mall rats, one of those rubber rats, and I hide
[32:26.980 --> 32:31.240]  it somewhere in the in the mall. And then we play rat mall. And then everybody goes around the mall
[32:31.240 --> 32:41.380]  and you try to find the rat I hid in the mall. Rat mall. Rat mall. Kevin, any thoughts on rat mall?
[32:41.820 --> 32:49.260]  Sign me up. Oh, I knew Gavin was on board from the get go. I'll play rat mall. And I was just
[32:49.260 --> 32:53.280]  thinking how much fun it would be if there was unintended consequences, like some people thought
[32:53.280 --> 32:57.520]  the rat was real or security finds it, you know, and they're like, what the fuck is this rubber
[32:57.520 --> 33:02.540]  rat? Is it a prank? But it's not a prank. It's just us playing a game. I foresee a lot of unintended
[33:03.400 --> 33:08.960]  hilarity. I also, man, I want somebody else to hide it so you can play rat mall, Jeff. Yeah,
[33:08.980 --> 33:14.560]  maybe we'll get Emily or somebody or one of anybody's wife or friend can come out and hide
[33:14.560 --> 33:18.040]  it for us and then we can all play rat mall together. I think you should have to have somebody
[33:18.040 --> 33:24.840]  in the mall hide it for you. You hand a guy a lock or a rat? Hey, do something about this.
[33:25.140 --> 33:30.960]  We need an inside person. Yeah. OK, so that's my first idea. Rat mall. Can we wear exterminator
[33:30.960 --> 33:37.540]  clothes? I think we should. I think you can dress however it makes you feel like you are best at
[33:37.540 --> 33:42.540]  finding the rat. I want to come up with my own pest control company and get a logo made and
[33:42.540 --> 33:47.700]  wear a big... I know what Nick will be wearing. He'll be wearing a big pair of red boots. That's
[33:47.700 --> 33:53.580]  right. OK, here's my second idea I want to hit you guys with. I like this idea better than the
[33:53.580 --> 33:57.900]  first idea. I've been thinking a lot about the past. I've been reminiscing a little bit. And one
[33:57.900 --> 34:03.440]  of my favorite, one of the favorite productions I ever made when we were doing Achievement Hunter
[34:03.440 --> 34:09.740]  back in the day was the show I made called Sunday Driving. And what that show was, was essentially
[34:09.740 --> 34:13.580]  what I did already. It's an old timey thing that people used to do back in the day. They would just
[34:13.580 --> 34:18.220]  go Sunday driving back when cars were novel. And you would just drive around and enjoy the weather
[34:18.220 --> 34:23.500]  and listen to music or whatever. And so in Grand Theft Auto, I had this game that we would do.
[34:24.100 --> 34:27.900]  I don't know. I guess it wasn't really a game. But this video we would do where I would drive
[34:27.900 --> 34:31.660]  around and I would pick somebody up on the street, like say Gavin. And then we would just start
[34:31.660 --> 34:34.860]  talking and have a conversation that we'd go look for somebody else. And eventually we'd find Andrew
[34:34.860 --> 34:39.660]  and pick him up and then find Eric or whatever and just go through the whole thing and make a video
[34:39.660 --> 34:43.100]  out of it. And we're just talking. And then the conversation flows interestingly because you're
[34:43.100 --> 34:49.260]  adding people to it as it goes. And I was thinking about how much fun that was. We've been back in
[34:49.260 --> 34:55.140]  GTA. We've been kicking the tires on GTA quite a bit. But I thought, why do that in GTA? Why not
[34:55.140 --> 35:01.640]  do it in real life? What if you guys go downtown in Austin and like a five or six mile radius and
[35:01.640 --> 35:07.000]  just stand on street corners. And maybe one of you gives me like an address location. And I just have
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.120]  to drive and pick up, let's say Eric. And then Eric and I have to figure out how to navigate to
[35:11.120 --> 35:15.260]  Gavin and Nick. And we just have a conversation while we do it. And then once we're all in the car,
[35:15.460 --> 35:20.880]  we go get ice cream or hot dogs or something. I love it. And we do Sunday driving in real life
[35:20.880 --> 35:26.540]  on a Sunday. Everyone you pick up has the clue to the next person. Yeah, that's like something
[35:26.540 --> 35:31.100]  like that. So there's like, we gamify it a little bit. But the point of it is the conversation and
[35:31.100 --> 35:35.740]  the journey, not necessarily like winning. So we don't want to make it too hard. But I like the
[35:35.740 --> 35:40.200]  idea of there being kind of stakes and us trying to figure... I feel like that would be more fun
[35:40.200 --> 35:46.800]  than just GPSing to somebody, you know? Yeah, definitely. I think no maps is a really fun way
[35:46.800 --> 35:52.160]  to do that too. With like just trying to figure out what streets everything is on. I think it's
[35:52.160 --> 35:56.840]  great. Yeah. And then like I was thinking we could dash cam that, but also if you don't want to,
[35:56.900 --> 36:03.440]  because I'm also cognizant of not wanting to step on toes. I know 100%Eat does a thing where you
[36:03.440 --> 36:07.320]  guys record yourselves from the dash cam. And so I wouldn't want to appear too similar to that.
[36:07.320 --> 36:12.640]  So another idea I had, if we don't want to do it that way, is then we could go back and cam it in
[36:12.640 --> 36:20.240]  GTA. Camming it in GTA would be insane. That is so much extra work. I'd rather just film it.
[36:20.500 --> 36:24.960]  What an insane amount of work that is. I don't think it is an insane amount of work. I think
[36:24.960 --> 36:30.060]  we just listen to it and then we just all play GTA while we listen to it. Yeah, we were just
[36:30.060 --> 36:36.920]  machinimating it as a big one. And then think about how realistic the audio is. That is crazy.
[36:36.920 --> 36:46.700]  That's crazy. Wow. Either way we do it, I think a real life slash real life and GTA Sunday driving
[36:46.700 --> 36:54.720]  would be a lot of fun. And I think that might be a cool Patreon show. What if we do it in real life?
[36:54.760 --> 36:58.620]  What if we do it in real life where you pick me up and then I have the clue to go get Gavin
[36:58.620 --> 37:02.080]  and then Gavin has the clue to go get Nick. And then after we go get Nick,
[37:02.080 --> 37:08.440]  like we record all this in real life and then we do it in the game. But at that point where
[37:08.440 --> 37:13.700]  we go get Nick, that's where we end. And then we pick up the rest of the conversation and it's
[37:13.700 --> 37:18.200]  in the game. But now Andrew can go and we pick up Andrew and then we do something in the game.
[37:18.320 --> 37:21.500]  That's cool too. That's cool. So then we are all participating. I like that too.
[37:21.900 --> 37:28.420]  If you didn't want to do the navigation thing, maybe I'm like on a call, like a discord call
[37:28.420 --> 37:33.300]  with Jeff and I have maps of Austin and I'm the only one who knows where everybody is and I'm
[37:33.300 --> 37:40.720]  having to try to relay to Jeff how to get to these people. I think that is a completely separate idea
[37:40.720 --> 37:46.040]  that's its own show. I think that's like keep talking and nobody explodes. But like, I think
[37:46.040 --> 37:50.760]  that's a great navigation. Yeah. Yeah. Like Andrew, I think like we do like a scavenger hunt or
[37:50.760 --> 37:53.820]  something through Austin and Andrew navigates this. I think that could be fucking fun. I mean,
[37:53.820 --> 37:57.160]  we can combine it with this too, but I just I think there's a lot there just in that alone.
[37:57.700 --> 38:02.280]  So that's great. That's kind of like the second idea I had in the lab. And then the third idea I
[38:02.280 --> 38:10.580]  had, I actually had the other night. We all we went to dinner. It was a Sunday night for your
[38:10.580 --> 38:18.200]  small wife's birthday, Eric. Yes. And so when we were done, we all said goodbye in a parking garage.
[38:18.240 --> 38:24.700]  And I was just thinking, it struck me that we were the only people in the parking garage. It was like
[38:24.700 --> 38:28.260]  11 o'clock at night when we were finished with dinner. And it was just like this downtown parking
[38:28.260 --> 38:33.920]  garage. And it was empty. And the sound was like, I don't know, the place was kind of baffling. And
[38:33.920 --> 38:39.100]  it was just like, it was a cool environment. And I thought, it's funny that we're the only people
[38:39.100 --> 38:42.300]  in this whole space right now, it would be fun to film something in here. But everybody was going
[38:42.300 --> 38:47.020]  their separate ways. And it was, you know, we all went to bed or whatever, went home. And that got
[38:47.020 --> 38:54.160]  me thinking, we should go back and do a podcast where we record in odd spaces. Now there was a
[38:54.160 --> 38:58.800]  podcast back in the day that Rooster Teeth, that was on The Roost called Podcast But Outside. I
[38:58.800 --> 39:02.100]  don't want to rip off their idea where they would just like set up a folding table and they would
[39:02.100 --> 39:05.920]  invite people to come and then they would have a conversation. But what if we did a like a
[39:05.920 --> 39:11.820]  supplemental series called Hide and Speak, where we went out in public, and then we've had to find
[39:11.820 --> 39:19.380]  a place where we hid, kind of like how Gavin would hide in Halo 2 behind the ramp. And then we get
[39:19.380 --> 39:24.020]  in there, we hide, we're in public, but we're like, I don't know, behind a tree or we're in like a
[39:24.020 --> 39:30.220]  cubby somewhere and we're hidden. And we record until somebody catches us, sees us, or until we
[39:30.220 --> 39:34.380]  hit like 20 minutes and then it's over. And if we like hit 20 minutes, we complete the goal, which
[39:34.380 --> 39:39.540]  is to stay hidden for the whole time. But we just do public podcasts, but they're hidden from the
[39:39.540 --> 39:45.800]  public. Hide and Speak. I love it. I love it just for the name. So I'm in. Great. Did that start
[39:45.800 --> 39:51.340]  with the name first? No, I came up with the name about an hour ago. The name, the name's phenomenal.
[39:51.340 --> 39:58.020]  Right before we started the let's play, I came up with the name. Okay. Last idea I have then.
[39:58.160 --> 40:05.380]  This one is a video game. I saw today and I just had this idea today. I saw today on the regulation
[40:05.380 --> 40:14.240]  subreddit, somebody mentioned that in Feed the Beast, which is a Minecraft mod utility, I guess
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.360]  would be how you describe it. There is a rats mod where you can play as rats and have rats all over
[40:19.360 --> 40:24.660]  the game and stuff. And so I was thinking, what if when we finally play Minecraft, we do, but we
[40:24.660 --> 40:32.160]  only play as rats and we only do rat things and we call it RatCraft. I mean, I like that as an I,
[40:32.380 --> 40:37.600]  as a like, yeah, I want to do that. Like a one-off. It wouldn't be like a whole series.
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.740]  But yeah, I think that's fun. We return to Minecraft for one time only for RatCraft.
[40:42.760 --> 40:48.440]  And it's RatCraft. And we play once. This concludes, oh, I have one other idea. I don't
[40:48.440 --> 40:51.420]  think we'll actually do it, but I was thinking it would be fun if you ever, if you guys ever wanted
[40:51.420 --> 40:57.200]  to have a roadside attraction, because I feel like that could be a lot of fun. An area that people
[40:57.200 --> 41:02.940]  haven't really dove into yet, I think that could be, that could be fun is retractions. You know,
[41:02.980 --> 41:07.120]  like when a newspaper has to run a retraction, what if you had a roadside retractions attraction
[41:07.420 --> 41:11.220]  where it was a roadside attraction that was full of retractions and you would go in and you would
[41:11.220 --> 41:14.960]  just see all the people, all the things people had to apologize for. That's it. I'm done.
[41:14.960 --> 41:18.580]  What are the retractions about? It's like anything that was in the New York Times,
[41:18.660 --> 41:21.980]  they had to issue a retraction. It's just all retractions are there. So if you ever wanted to
[41:21.980 --> 41:26.260]  see a retraction, that's the clearinghouse of all retractions. People are hearing this and probably
[41:26.260 --> 41:31.220]  going like, that's, that's so weird. That's crazy. Whatever. Drive anywhere on Route 66 and stop on
[41:31.220 --> 41:35.300]  any of those things. We just saw cars in the ground that you could spray paint. This is no different
[41:35.300 --> 41:40.620]  from that. This is, this is not a bad idea. Yeah. It's no different than the world's largest
[41:40.620 --> 41:49.200]  thermometer. I like all these out-in-the-world ideas. Well, the roadside retractions attraction
[41:49.200 --> 41:52.420]  was just the dumb name idea I had that I had to throw out there. So it's been making me giggle
[41:52.420 --> 41:57.440]  for a couple of weeks, but the other, the other things I would actually like to do. It reminds
[41:57.440 --> 42:03.820]  me, Andrew, did you ever find the building? What? Oh no. Still looking. Still looking. I'm
[42:03.820 --> 42:09.540]  still trying to find it. No idea where it is. This is from when Andrew sent me a picture of
[42:09.540 --> 42:13.320]  an Austin and I had to find where it was and I immediately found it. And then I sent him somewhere
[42:13.320 --> 42:20.140]  in Nanaimo. Oh, just a picture of a place that he's still never found. How long ago was that?
[42:21.360 --> 42:28.700]  Months. Months ago. I happened to pick a coffee shop that he had previously been to. Yeah. You
[42:28.700 --> 42:32.040]  sent me a picture of a building. It didn't say the name, but I recognized it. I was like, oh,
[42:32.120 --> 42:37.780]  that's, uh, that's Halcyon. I went there with whoever. Yeah. Still haven't found it. Still
[42:37.780 --> 42:43.540]  looking. You have to update us when you do. Oh, I listen. It'll be top of my notes. Oh, that's
[42:43.540 --> 42:50.840]  good. A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days. Eight different settings,
[42:50.980 --> 42:58.900]  adjustable intensity, plus it's heated and it just feels so good. Yes, a massage chair might
[42:58.900 --> 43:05.340]  seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car, suddenly it seems quite practical.
[43:05.340 --> 43:11.740]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan, packed with premium features like available massaging front
[43:11.740 --> 43:17.580]  seats. It only feels extravagant. This episode is brought to you by Nespresso Virtual Coffee

[43:40.200 --> 43:46.400]  I actually have one thing that to bring to the table and it's Gavin won't stop sending me voice
[43:46.400 --> 43:52.140]  memos. We found out at dinner on your small wife's birthday, which is for some reason also my
[43:52.140 --> 43:59.740]  birthday. For some reason, I got brought a happy birthday dessert. And so did she. And I was like,
[43:59.740 --> 44:05.540]  my wife said that she was so happy that happened because it wasn't like she didn't have like all
[44:05.540 --> 44:09.420]  the attention on her. It was like, oh, good. Everyone's paying attention to Gavin and like
[44:09.420 --> 44:13.400]  the goofy birthday thing. By the way, that that fucking place that we went is my favorite
[44:13.400 --> 44:17.360]  restaurant in all of Austin. I love it so much. Although the service was a little all over the
[44:17.360 --> 44:23.520]  map, I thought so. But fucking yogurt is not dessert. I thought it was really good. I loved
[44:23.520 --> 44:29.300]  it. I thought it was fantastic. But during that meal, Eric let me know that he hates voice memos
[44:29.300 --> 44:34.860]  being sent. Yeah, it's faster for the sender, but slower for the receiver. It is. It's absolutely
[44:34.860 --> 44:39.960]  true. If you're so distracted that you can't type out your thing concisely, that you're just
[44:40.520 --> 44:45.660]  recording a voice note that is like 45 seconds long because you're driving or whatever. Don't
[44:45.660 --> 44:51.140]  bother. Yeah, I've received a lot and I've never sent any. But now I'm sending them. He is sending
[44:51.140 --> 44:57.760]  them to Eric. He's just said just a slurp of his coffee. Yep. Just out here enjoying some coffee.
[44:57.760 --> 45:02.900]  It's like you have any previews. You have anything lined up that you could share? I've got I've got
[45:02.900 --> 45:14.960]  a good response from Eric because he sent one in reply. I hate this. None of that came through.
[45:15.180 --> 45:19.840]  None of it came through. I think I said I hate this. That is that is correct.
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.280]  Not a fan, but it is the only way that Gavin texts me now. So
[45:28.060 --> 45:34.460]  it also it's you can see like it'll transcribe it, but it won't transcribe.
[45:34.620 --> 45:38.300]  It says, like, tap for more or whatever. And then at that point, you're already so
[45:38.300 --> 45:42.520]  so many steps into this thing that it's just not none of this is worth it. It's the worst.
[45:43.020 --> 45:46.160]  But now because I don't text Eric that much and I want to send him voice memos,
[45:46.280 --> 45:50.780]  I'm just sending them for no reason. I'm just like sending like little check-ins. I'm just
[45:50.780 --> 45:55.740]  telling about stuff that I would never normally text him. It's so banal. And that's really what
[45:55.740 --> 46:01.740]  the voice memo thing is anyway, is that it's just banal stuff that is to you and not for you.
[46:02.400 --> 46:05.620]  I probably won't play down the mic, but it's transcribed it. This is what I sent him.
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.320]  Hey, man. Yeah, I'm just out with dinner. I'm wondering your thoughts on whether I should
[46:10.320 --> 46:15.660]  get this big guy chocolate cake or not. Still undecided, but I figured I'd ask around some
[46:15.660 --> 46:20.300]  friends. Yeah, because one of the desserts at the restaurant I was at was a big guy chocolate cake.
[46:20.880 --> 46:22.880]  So, you know, I'm just checking in. I'm just seeing how he's doing.
[46:23.140 --> 46:23.800]  Did you get it?
[46:23.800 --> 46:27.080]  I didn't because he didn't say anything apart from I hate this.
[46:27.140 --> 46:30.760]  Yeah, I think I just said I hate this. I didn't care about the big guy chocolate cake.
[46:31.360 --> 46:36.380]  My wife, though, loves it. My wife thinks this is hilarious. She keeps telling me what to say
[46:36.380 --> 46:41.920]  back to Gavin. And I just keep going. I don't want to like I don't want I tried like once and then
[46:41.920 --> 46:46.420]  I just went this is not for me. I don't want to encourage this. What did she want you to say to me?
[46:46.780 --> 46:52.460]  I I don't remember what it was or what because you've sent me a bunch of voice memos and she
[46:52.460 --> 46:56.080]  has heard them and then she would be like, oh, say this. And I don't remember what it is. And
[46:56.080 --> 46:59.880]  it's just like, no, I don't want to encourage this behavior. This is terrible.
[47:00.980 --> 47:06.160]  I think you two should have to communicate exclusively via walkie talkie for like a week.
[47:07.060 --> 47:11.400]  I think you both need walkie talkies and that's the only way you can talk to each other.
[47:12.100 --> 47:16.060]  You don't have to be as concise, though. I'd have to do it all as big. One big long take.
[47:16.320 --> 47:21.160]  No, but I think it's funny for you to just be able to like buzz in like you guys get your code names,
[47:21.160 --> 47:27.600]  your trucker names are use those. What is what's the range on a walkie talkie? I'm sure you could
[47:27.600 --> 47:33.380]  get a ridiculously long range one. Maybe we should get into ham radio. Oh, you can go across the
[47:33.380 --> 47:38.400]  fucking globe in here radio. Hey, bounce it off the atmosphere. Let's see what some long range
[47:38.400 --> 47:45.800]  walkie talkies go for. But long range is like what is long range? I have no idea. Man, four hundred
[47:45.800 --> 47:50.940]  dollars will get you to walkie talkie. Oh, my God. They're normally a thousand dollars. But
[47:50.940 --> 47:57.480]  but everyone's saying like it's a pretty unlimited range. What does that mean? Unlimited range.
[47:58.160 --> 48:03.620]  Yeah, I believe that. I don't believe that at all. Unlimited distance, unlimited use nationwide. I
[48:03.620 --> 48:10.200]  think it's just a phone. I have a 50 foot ham. I have a 50 foot ham tower that gives me about
[48:10.200 --> 48:15.620]  13 miles of range with these walkie talkies around the house. What the fuck?
[48:18.020 --> 48:23.760]  You have a what? Let's get into ham towers. I don't want to get into ham towers.
[48:24.860 --> 48:27.720]  We're in a different ham zone, but we're back in the ham zone.
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.300]  We're in the return to the ham zone? We're a whole different kind of ham fandom.
[48:34.380 --> 48:40.100]  Wow. Maybe that's what the ham was about. Oh, ham fan? Yeah. Could have been a radio
[48:40.100 --> 48:47.080]  fan, not a Hamilton fan. Yeah, I'd be willing to if we could get the range, I would do the walkie
[48:47.080 --> 48:55.460]  talkie then. I just think it's funny. For how long? A week? Yeah. You have the buzz whenever.
[48:56.020 --> 49:01.860]  It's more intrusive, I feel like. I don't want to do that. Because it's a live thing. More intrusive
[49:01.860 --> 49:05.160]  than a phone? Yeah, I think so. Because the message there isn't implied like you can get
[49:05.160 --> 49:11.940]  to it where you're just demanding that Eric respond in this moment to help you with your
[49:11.940 --> 49:16.920]  cake decision. Oh, I got a voice message from Eric. Oh, you did? I'll see if it plays through.
[49:18.220 --> 49:25.880]  I don't want to do that. Thank you. Now, is that the ham radio or just radios in general?
[49:26.240 --> 49:33.180]  I assume all of this. All of it? Yes, Gavin is right. You know, I gotta say though, that's a
[49:33.180 --> 49:38.740]  great way to communicate because I feel like I can understand Eric more here because of the
[49:39.560 --> 49:44.320]  inflection. I'm not just having to interpret the text. Yeah, right, right. But that was a quick,
[49:44.500 --> 49:49.960]  that one was a what? A three-second thing. Gavin is sending me stuff that's like 25 seconds plus
[49:49.960 --> 49:55.520]  and you're trapped. If I could like skip through or fast forward or whatever, then at least there's
[49:55.520 --> 49:58.820]  something there. And also, it's about nothing. There's the difference. It's about big guy
[49:58.820 --> 50:03.620]  chocolate cake. There's the difference, Eric. You might be trapped, but I hang on his every word.
[50:05.200 --> 50:06.760]  Go sit in his lap and shit.
[50:09.260 --> 50:14.300]  What if I send the messages directly to your small wife and she can relay any
[50:14.300 --> 50:17.440]  important info to you? Why don't you go ahead and do that?
[50:18.600 --> 50:25.220]  I'm scared. Yeah, you're texting my wife voice messages. Hey, so what have you guys been up to?
[50:25.220 --> 50:28.180]  Gavin's been sending my wife a lot of voice memos.
[50:31.190 --> 50:34.270]  Maybe we need to add a Slack channel that's just voice memos.
[50:35.270 --> 50:40.810]  Oh, it's terrible. Oh man, we found out that our fart channel got archived.
[50:41.630 --> 50:48.290]  Yeah, that's a bummer. Slack is holding Jeff's farts hostage. Our farts went behind the paywall.
[50:48.630 --> 50:54.070]  Because they're over 90 days old. Yeah, you're supposed to pay for Slack and we just don't.
[50:54.070 --> 50:57.590]  There is a premium, yeah, paid for version of Slack and then the free version.
[50:58.290 --> 51:02.950]  And when I went to film something, I thought I could pull Jeff's farts and nothing was there.
[51:03.330 --> 51:06.690]  And so I texted him, did you delete all your farts? Where did the farts go?
[51:06.810 --> 51:10.030]  Andrew was like, why did you delete all your farts? Why did you do this?
[51:10.190 --> 51:14.830]  Like very accusatory. And I was like, what? Well, I just assumed that if anyone were going
[51:14.830 --> 51:18.970]  to delete it, like I just felt like... Why would I ever? I don't know. That's why I was asking.
[51:18.970 --> 51:24.750]  And then it just sent me a screenshot. I didn't have it on my display of them saying that after
[51:24.750 --> 51:31.390]  like 30 or whatever, however many days it archives it, it's not permanently gone. If I pay for Slack
[51:31.390 --> 51:36.710]  now, they will reappear. So they're holding Jeff's farts hostage. I think it's so funny.
[51:36.970 --> 51:41.650]  I was able to find the farts on my phone and send them to him. And I was actually kind of happy
[51:41.650 --> 51:45.470]  because when I did, I remembered I had completely forgotten that right before I stopped recording,
[51:45.530 --> 51:48.870]  I had started recording all my diarrhea as well. And man, those are some sounds.
[51:48.970 --> 51:53.530]  Yeah. Why are you recording diarrhea? Cause I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what
[51:53.530 --> 51:58.670]  I was. It's pretty gross, right? I don't know what the point of that was, but it did it.
[51:59.310 --> 52:03.690]  And I got a bunch of them. I feel like... Why are you holding the phone during that?
[52:04.170 --> 52:08.390]  Just out in front of me. Like if I was reading it. Yeah. Do you think I'm like wedging it down
[52:08.390 --> 52:13.970]  into the toilet to get like superior sound? No. Yes. Yes, I did think that. I think it's because
[52:13.970 --> 52:21.290]  my shits are so loud that I can have a shit upstairs and Emily can hear it in the front yard.
[52:22.150 --> 52:25.050]  Like it is... Why don't you put your phone in the front yard and we'll see if that's true.
[52:25.130 --> 52:29.510]  We can do that. We can absolutely do that. Let's see how loud my shits are. Yeah,
[52:29.570 --> 52:33.230]  we could do that. I can play some for you right now. It's very loud. No, it's good. We're good.
[52:33.490 --> 52:37.110]  No, I mean, we'll just, we'll just test it with like the experiment later. Yeah. You don't need
[52:37.110 --> 52:41.570]  to send it. You sure? Cause I got positive. Oh yeah. No, we're sure. Thanks. Okay.
[52:42.450 --> 52:49.290]  I needed the, the Jeff farts for a video that we filmed in the quiet place game. I got a code for
[52:49.290 --> 52:53.830]  it and I'd been playing it and they had a feature where you can make a, use your mic to capture
[52:53.830 --> 52:59.770]  your environmental audio, doing testing of different things that you wouldn't see in the movie,
[52:59.930 --> 53:04.250]  but are very much a part of day to day life. And I've been playing that game a lot. That's
[53:04.250 --> 53:11.550]  a really fun game. I was surprised by how tense it was for me as somebody who had like seen the
[53:11.550 --> 53:16.810]  I think it's almost the best thing you could say about a licensed game where it has changed my
[53:16.810 --> 53:22.190]  view of those films. Like it has made me so much more invested and feel so much more intense for
[53:22.190 --> 53:27.850]  the characters because it is, it's tough to be quiet. Should we try a let's play at it?
[53:27.950 --> 53:31.590]  Oh, that'd be fun. Yeah. It might be fun to kind of do what we did and have,
[53:32.130 --> 53:35.150]  have all of our discord audio be coming through. So we all have to be quiet.
[53:35.290 --> 53:39.190]  Well, the problem with it, I originally thought, Oh, I'll do a let's play, but I
[53:39.190 --> 53:44.330]  ended up getting so into character. I just wasn't talking. Like I was in a group call
[53:44.330 --> 53:48.110]  with some people while playing it. And I just could not speak because I was like,
[53:48.150 --> 53:51.590]  I got to be fucking quiet. Even though it couldn't pick up my voice is just so...
[53:51.590 --> 53:53.290]  To be fair, you did the same in Tombstone Tally.
[53:53.730 --> 53:55.290]  Well, we were all doing it in Tombstone.
[53:55.770 --> 53:59.590]  I like the idea that we could, we could only really have conversations by waterfalls and stuff.
[54:01.070 --> 54:02.250]  Well, a little talk sound.
[54:02.770 --> 54:04.210]  Little hide and speak, if you will.
[54:04.730 --> 54:08.570]  I'm going to share my screen for a minute. I have a clip for when I was playing it.
[54:08.570 --> 54:14.630]  I thought I was the smartest person in the world for a moment.
[54:15.410 --> 54:18.370]  And it went very much against me. So I'm sharing my screen.
[54:18.770 --> 54:21.690]  So you're trying to be sneaky. It is the whole thing of like,
[54:21.710 --> 54:24.590]  you're just trying to avoid these aliens as quiet as possible.
[54:25.170 --> 54:29.230]  And I was in, I was in a real bad situation where you have these moments
[54:30.230 --> 54:33.530]  where you get these planks and you have to lay them down.
[54:33.610 --> 54:35.370]  This is the first time I'd used a plank.
[54:35.910 --> 54:41.070]  So there is a, the alien is following me around to give context of this clip.
[54:41.310 --> 54:42.590]  And I'll explain it while walking through.
[54:43.070 --> 54:45.990]  So I'm holding this plank and the alien is close by.
[54:46.270 --> 54:49.170]  And I'm like, I just got to get across here and then I'll checkpoint.
[54:50.250 --> 54:53.470]  And so I'm walking and I see, I've never placed one before.
[54:53.570 --> 54:57.030]  I place it. You have to slowly do it so it doesn't make noise.
[54:57.110 --> 55:00.370]  It doesn't just flump. I turn around, the alien's right fucking there.
[55:00.570 --> 55:01.210]  And I'm like, oh God.
[55:01.330 --> 55:04.670]  And I thought you clicked A to go across, but that's how you reset it.
[55:04.670 --> 55:08.550]  So then I had to place it again and I'm slowly bringing it down.
[55:08.790 --> 55:11.850]  And then I turn and I'm like, I want to move.
[55:11.970 --> 55:14.230]  But the alien's right there and I make noise every step.
[55:14.270 --> 55:15.350]  What do I do? What do I fuck?
[55:15.550 --> 55:16.510]  Oh, he's looking at me.
[55:16.550 --> 55:19.910]  And I'm like, I'll just get on the beam so that way he can't get me.
[55:20.110 --> 55:24.250]  I'm just gonna, I'm gonna stand here and I'll wait for him to leave while I just hang out on this beam.
[55:24.410 --> 55:25.430]  Oh, I fucking broke.
[55:26.170 --> 55:28.890]  You can't just stand on the beam, is what I thought.
[55:29.330 --> 55:30.650]  The beam breaks.
[55:30.850 --> 55:31.670]  The beam breaks.
[55:31.850 --> 55:34.110]  Oh, what the fuck?
[55:35.070 --> 55:39.410]  It's all of, I was just clipping nonstop of me shitting myself playing this game.
[55:39.710 --> 55:42.510]  Every time I'd have an interaction, this is my first one,
[55:42.970 --> 55:48.170]  where I'm just like walking through, trying to be all sneaky, just looking at my bar.
[55:48.270 --> 55:51.850]  You can see how much noise you're making in contrast to the world around you.
[55:51.870 --> 55:54.630]  And I'm like, okay, everything's all good.
[55:54.750 --> 55:56.230]  And it's fucking right there.
[55:56.590 --> 55:57.410]  Oh my God.
[55:57.750 --> 55:58.650]  Holy shit.
[56:00.430 --> 56:01.470]  It's just terrifying.
[56:01.470 --> 56:04.170]  Because, you know, like in the movie, I never think about the idea of like,
[56:04.250 --> 56:07.550]  if you end up next to one of these things, what do you, you just kind of stuck.
[56:07.890 --> 56:09.130]  You can't move.
[56:09.850 --> 56:10.670]  Because you make noise.
[56:10.990 --> 56:12.350]  Your lungs aren't looking good.
[56:12.570 --> 56:13.450]  No, it's real bad.
[56:13.650 --> 56:20.870]  You play as an asthmatic pregnant woman, which is a deadly combo for a quiet play scenario.
[56:21.210 --> 56:21.850]  Just tiptoeing.
[56:22.190 --> 56:26.850]  But we're going to have a, almost like a things to do type thing coming out for that.
[56:26.970 --> 56:28.470]  It'll be up by the time this comes out.
[56:28.470 --> 56:32.850]  If you want to see the video of that, the, the, the YouTube version will have it in.
[56:33.150 --> 56:33.430]  Yes.
[56:33.870 --> 56:34.610]  If you're listening.
[56:35.730 --> 56:38.410]  Um, that's not the only gaming thing.
[56:38.650 --> 56:42.150]  You mind if I pivot to another game?
[56:42.150 --> 56:42.590]  Please do.
[56:43.170 --> 56:44.470]  Jeff, you're a part of this.
[56:45.050 --> 56:51.770]  I was, uh, I was playing Sea of Thieves, having a good time by myself,
[56:51.770 --> 56:55.250]  just relaxing, doing some chess, getting up some loot and treasure.
[56:55.790 --> 57:00.110]  And, uh, I got boarded by two people who were dicks and they killed,
[57:00.210 --> 57:01.790]  they just kept killing me over and over again.
[57:02.110 --> 57:04.250]  I noticed a ship on a different island.
[57:04.410 --> 57:05.350]  I thought I'll avoid that.
[57:05.410 --> 57:06.110]  I don't want to fight.
[57:06.370 --> 57:11.830]  They had, I guess, cannonballed or like rowboated to where I was and just hit in my boat.
[57:12.210 --> 57:14.950]  And then when I went to leave, they just started killing me.
[57:15.090 --> 57:20.630]  And their plan was to steer my boat back to their boat to sink me and then steal all my stuff.
[57:21.190 --> 57:26.150]  But at the last minute, I killed them and I took control of my boat again and I escaped.
[57:26.450 --> 57:30.970]  Then another ship showed up and started attacking them, sunk them.
[57:31.290 --> 57:32.250]  And I thought, this is great.
[57:32.290 --> 57:34.370]  I can now just get rid of all my stuff and sell it.
[57:34.630 --> 57:37.550]  They happened to spawn in the path of where I needed to go.
[57:38.070 --> 57:41.350]  So then we started a whole new chase and they were just trying to shoot me.
[57:41.430 --> 57:43.650]  They were like clearly very experienced in this game.
[57:44.190 --> 57:46.270]  And so I pulled up my recent players.
[57:46.390 --> 57:47.470]  I recognize one of the names.
[57:48.110 --> 57:50.930]  And once again, great feature at Xbox.
[57:51.230 --> 57:53.670]  You can link your Twitch account to your profile.
[57:54.570 --> 57:56.750]  And if they do that, you can open their Twitch.
[57:57.090 --> 58:02.310]  And so I opened the Twitch and it was they were streaming their perspective of chasing me.
[58:02.650 --> 58:07.550]  And so I tweeted out, hey, these guys are chasing me.
[58:07.610 --> 58:09.390]  It's real like this isn't going great.
[58:09.910 --> 58:10.930]  Go watch if you want.
[58:11.350 --> 58:15.110]  And then their chat went from they had two people in their stream.
[58:15.110 --> 58:19.810]  It was the guy who was streaming himself watching and his friend who was playing with him watching.
[58:20.090 --> 58:24.150]  And they suddenly spiked to 100 viewers and they didn't know why.
[58:24.350 --> 58:26.750]  And they started freaking out as to why.
[58:26.850 --> 58:29.490]  It was also very funny where I was messing with them.
[58:29.590 --> 58:32.790]  And he was the most upset streamer I've ever heard.
[58:32.870 --> 58:35.730]  He was cursing and like punching the wall and be like, this is bullshit.
[58:36.110 --> 58:37.210]  This is the worst fucking thing.
[58:37.410 --> 58:41.670]  And then all these people showed up and they're like, oh, hey, hey, hey, there are people here.
[58:42.110 --> 58:44.390]  Whoa, I get raided by somebody.
[58:44.950 --> 58:46.430]  And they didn't know how to react.
[58:46.570 --> 58:47.830]  They were losing their minds about it.
[58:48.030 --> 58:53.130]  And the chat was so fucking funny where nobody was revealing where they came from, but they
[58:53.130 --> 58:57.890]  were making all sorts of references to the podcast like this is a regulation stream
[58:57.890 --> 58:58.990]  and all that type of thing.
[58:59.130 --> 59:02.530]  And they had no clue what was going on.
[59:03.210 --> 59:09.370]  And so I texted Gavin saying, like, I need help because I was trying to accomplish something.
[59:09.930 --> 59:12.370]  And I really needed a second hand on deck.
[59:12.370 --> 59:16.010]  And I know Gavin has never had one of these moments in that game.
[59:16.090 --> 59:20.430]  So I thought, oh, it'd be great to let Gavin see this side of this game that he hasn't
[59:20.430 --> 59:21.070]  seen before.
[59:21.590 --> 59:22.350]  Gavin was busy.
[59:22.890 --> 59:25.910]  So then I went to the Slack and said, is anyone around?
[59:26.230 --> 59:32.570]  And Jeff was kind enough to hop on and help with this this getaway, which was perfect
[59:32.570 --> 59:37.010]  because I did a thing that allowed me to go into a part of the map that you can only go
[59:37.010 --> 59:38.110]  to if you do that thing.
[59:38.550 --> 59:42.110]  And they did not know that you had to manually activate it.
[59:42.490 --> 59:47.370]  So they went to swap over to do what I was doing and it would not work for them.
[59:47.470 --> 59:50.510]  And so they they got sunk all while yelling about it.
[59:50.530 --> 59:52.590]  And it was it was great trolling.
[59:53.050 --> 59:54.730]  And then we had to try to escape.
[59:54.910 --> 59:59.190]  The problem when all the people joined is they became way more committed to sinking me.
[59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.810]  It was like, oh, they're never going to stop.
[01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.910]  They're just going to continue to chase.
[01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.230]  And so I said, Jeff, take the wheel and go west.
[01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.810]  And Jeff, there's no fault of your own.
[01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:11.830]  I did not know Jeff had never steered the boat before.
[01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:16.070]  So the first question Jeff said was, how do I tell which way is west?
[01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.490]  And there's a compass right next to the wheel that tells you what direction you're going.
[01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.410]  Figured it out immediately.
[01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.930]  Yeah, he instantly figured it out after that and said, ignore me.
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.310]  And then you said, I think you misinterpreted the wind.
[01:00:27.610 --> 01:00:28.470]  It was a whole thing.
[01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:33.110]  But it's like, oh, boy, we are this is an unexperienced crew for this scenario.
[01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:34.610]  It's not great.
[01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:37.090]  And unfortunately, misinterpret the wind.
[01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:38.770]  I don't even know what he's talking about there.
[01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.510]  I don't.
[01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:41.550]  You said, like, how do I?
[01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:42.290]  I don't remember.
[01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.650]  It was a small detail, but it was you.
[01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:47.630]  I think we we on voice on voice chat talking.
[01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:48.650]  We're on Discord.
[01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:49.330]  Yeah, we are.
[01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.130]  No, yeah, we're talking back and forth.
[01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:54.350]  And I sent Jeff a link to the stream so he could hear what they were saying.
[01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:57.330]  They wanted me banned for stream sniper.
[01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:02.410]  They were not because I was in their chat saying, hey, maybe you should let this guy go.
[01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:04.290]  Maybe this isn't worth it.
[01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:06.850]  Maybe you should just let them escape.
[01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.450]  They eventually killed us, but they eventually.
[01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:11.550]  Yeah, we did not.
[01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.910]  We did not last long beyond sinking them in that one instance.
[01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:19.250]  I'm not much help in a fight in a game I haven't played since the last time we recorded in it,
[01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:22.230]  which would have been yeah, rooster teeth went under, I think.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:23.970]  I think I'm the same way, though.
[01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.790]  You know, I don't think I've ever driven the boat.
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:27.550]  I just never considered it.
[01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:30.090]  It was very funny to be like, OK, Jeff, you take the wheel.
[01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.010]  I was weird.
[01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:33.130]  I was like, I've literally never.
[01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:37.510]  I mean, surely I have for like one second before, but whenever I play with the
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.410]  Burndog and Antonio, Antonio is always the captain.
[01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.530]  And whenever I play with y'all, Andrew's always the captain.
[01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:43.890]  So I just never come up.
[01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:45.430]  Yeah, it's funny.
[01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:49.950]  But it was so I think it's the thing I'm going to do whenever anybody is chasing me.
[01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:51.530]  And I noticed they happen to be streaming.
[01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:55.050]  Is it so funny to see the reaction change and how they adjust?
[01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:58.510]  I was hoping it would kind of throw them off, which it did initially.
[01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:01.530]  But that was great.
[01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:02.290]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.450]  After you messaged me, I reinstalled Sea of Thieves.
[01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:06.250]  Great.
[01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:08.110]  Just in case I was able to jump in again.
[01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.490]  And then today, Call of Duty needed like a 300 gig update.
[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:12.270]  So I deleted it.
[01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:13.850]  Dude, I wish you wouldn't.
[01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:16.790]  They just released a big update to Sea of Thieves that we should play.
[01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.930]  I need to get a bigger storage.
[01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.450]  Oh, how do you want to shit on us for not having a bigger storage?
[01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:24.250]  You're constantly shitting on us for not having enough space.
[01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.890]  What a great turn near the end of the episode that this just took.
[01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.630]  This is fantastic.
[01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:33.410]  I just went and bought a two terabyte fucking drive because Gavin shit on me in an episode like three weeks ago.
[01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:37.830]  Mine's one terabyte, but I had to delete Fallout and uh...
[01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:39.110]  Well, we're not going to use Fallout. That's fine.
[01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:40.630]  Yeah, and Sea of Thieves.
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.850]  Reinstall Sea of Thieves.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:45.750]  I just need more time to properly consider what to delete.
[01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:47.730]  I just did it quickly because we were going to play.
[01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:48.330]  I understand.
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.290]  But they just released like a trolling update, which is cool.
[01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:52.570]  They did.
[01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:56.290]  But this man always shitting on us deleting stuff.
[01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.310]  He's deleting stuff.
[01:02:57.310 --> 01:02:58.750]  He's just quietly deleting.
[01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:02.790]  Well, I couldn't exactly be... I'm gonna get a bigger storage,
[01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:05.470]  but that wouldn't help me today when we needed to play the other game.
[01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.990]  Interesting.
[01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.530]  I feel like that wouldn't fly if you were on the other end of this conversation right now.
[01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:12.410]  Interesting.
[01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:14.670]  I feel like that wouldn't be good enough.
[01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.830]  I feel like Gavin would hit back with a,
[01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.690]  but we need the space today.
[01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.210]  Or one of those snarky comments.
[01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.630]  Yeah, it's a portable drive.
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.970]  I may have snarked it.
[01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:25.570]  I think it's also a bit of a bummer that,
[01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:28.450]  you know, if you upgrade from one terabyte to two terabytes,
[01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:29.810]  you can't.
[01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:30.630]  It's not three.
[01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:34.310]  You just have to take out the one and then go to it.
[01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.170]  It really does suck.
[01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:38.490]  Oh, got a voice memo, I think.
[01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:39.430]  Oh, you did?
[01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.990]  Oh, Eric told us to wrap it up.
[01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:42.610]  Hey man, I think they got you on this one.
[01:03:42.690 --> 01:03:42.970]  Sorry.
[01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:48.770]  No, I was just, I was just agreeing with you guys and letting Gavin know that he got got.
[01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.550]  Oh, can I leave voice memos on Slack?
[01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:52.130]  Yeah, I can.
[01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:53.690]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.690]  Oh, shit.
[01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:56.810]  Are you guys getting in a huddle?
[01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.050]  Oh, no, that's a whole other thing.
[01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:00.450]  I love to huddle up, though.
[01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:01.930]  Great music in the huddle.
[01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:03.290]  Andrew made a voice.
[01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:04.310]  Oh, can I play this?
[01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:05.950]  I mean, it's just what I said, but yeah.
[01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:07.650]  You heard the memo.
[01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:09.150]  Can I leave voice memos on Slack?
[01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:09.650]  Yeah, I can.
[01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:10.490]  Oh, I see.
[01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:12.990]  I was just testing it.
[01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:18.190]  I think this is, we're getting in the voice memo territory and I'm very excited about it.
[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.670]  Is this our voice memo era?
[01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:20.790]  I think so.
[01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:21.650]  Sorry, Eric.
[01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.570]  Can we leave voice memos on Discord for the Falcons?
[01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:24.650]  Could we?
[01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.030]  Could we?
[01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:27.310]  I don't know.
[01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:33.110]  I feel like we could just go into the channel right now and then finish the episode out over
[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:34.570]  there and that would be something.
[01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.250]  But that's all I could really think of.
[01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:37.510]  Message Eric Baddour.
[01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.670]  Don't message Eric Baddour.
[01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:43.170]  Wrap up episode instead of message Eric Baddour.
[01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:45.510]  I don't think I can send a voice memo.
[01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:49.370]  Yeah, congratulations on making it a quarter of a century, guys.
[01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:52.930]  25 episodes of Regulation Podcast.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.410]  It seems like just yesterday that we ended F*** Face at episode 206?
[01:04:57.610 --> 01:04:57.990]  207?
[01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:58.530]  Whatever it was.
[01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.410]  What was it?
[01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.810]  206.
[01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:02.990]  Yeah, but it was our...
[01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.150]  206?
[01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.830]  It was...
[01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:06.710]  206 would have been our 205th episode.
[01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:07.170]  Is that right?
[01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.790]  So we did one episode for every bone in the body.
[01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:13.690]  Which was exactly how we planned it out.
[01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.330]  And thank you for finally revealing the true secret of F*** Face.
[01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:22.350]  It was only designed to go as many episodes as we have bones in a body.
[01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.630]  How are we going to end regulation?
[01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:29.610]  Hopefully we have more than 180-odd episodes or so to go.
[01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:31.270]  We're going to have to get some new bones.
[01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:37.150]  Speaking of getting new bones, you guys should go get a t-shirt over at TheRegulationStore.com.
[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:43.030]  Or if buying a t-shirt's not your thing, maybe go check out our Patreon over at...
[01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:44.010]  Well, you know what?
[01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.450]  Just go to Regulatrion.com or Jeff.Sucks and that'll answer all your questions.
[01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:50.810]  And have a good day.
[01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:51.530]  Or night.
[01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:52.290]  I don't know what time it...
[01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:53.650]  I don't even know when you're listening to this.
[01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:55.130]  But if it's evening, have a good evening.
[01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:56.430]  If it's in the morning, have a good day.
[01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.110]  That was a fantastic outro.
[01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:01.250]  Yeah, I just had a quick question for Eric and Gavin before we wrapped up.
[01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:04.310]  Did you guys have hot dog paranoia last night?
[01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:06.830]  Because the hot dog counters were flying.
[01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:09.570]  I never have hot dog paranoia, no.
[01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.710]  Okay.
[01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:10.510]  It's not a competition.
[01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:11.450]  It's not.
[01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:13.370]  I'm one dog, so the dog...
[01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.490]  I just look at the nice pictures.
[01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:15.870]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:17.410]  Jeff takes great photos.
[01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:19.310]  I take a photo of every hot dog I eat.
[01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:22.690]  Bye!
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.590]  Bye!
