[00:00.620 --> 00:04.760]  Today's top story, the flavor merger of the century between the Peanut Butter
[00:04.760 --> 00:09.260]  Group and Chocolaty Corp. Joining me is a PBC executive. Thanks for having me, Barry.
[00:09.640 --> 00:13.860]  Now, how did you know the merger and the byproduct of it, Jif Peanut Butter and
[00:13.860 --> 00:18.160]  Chocolate Flavored Spread, would be a success? You know, it was a gut feeling.
[00:18.520 --> 00:24.400]  A rumbling, if you will. Besides, they're two titans of taste. Very true. Goes great
[00:24.400 --> 00:28.780]  with pretzels. And pancakes. Apples too, I bet. Try Jif PBC today.
[00:30.080 --> 00:34.900]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast. My name is Jeff Ramsey.
[00:35.020 --> 00:40.320]  With me, as always, in order of importance from evens to odds this time, Andrew Panton,
[00:40.480 --> 00:48.700]  Gavin Free, Nick Schwartz, Eric Baddour. This is episode 14. It's supposed to be a weird
[00:48.700 --> 00:51.820]  one, but the last one was a little weird. So maybe it'll be a super normal episode.
[00:52.140 --> 00:56.960]  Is New York the only place that has a groove? I'm sorry, say that again, please.
[00:57.180 --> 01:03.320]  Is New York the only place that has a groove? Gavin yelled, I'm back, which immediately
[01:03.320 --> 01:10.540]  my head started, I'm back, back in the New York groove. But I'm back. Is New York the
[01:10.540 --> 01:17.440]  only place with a groove? I've never heard of any other grooves. Just New York's.
[01:18.180 --> 01:29.220]  Famous groove. Let's see. Many years since I was here. Yeah, there aren't a lot of groove
[01:29.220 --> 01:35.840]  locate groove locate famous groove location. How about that? I think it's maybe a market
[01:35.840 --> 01:39.840]  we could look into getting. I mean, we don't even have an intro song, but if we were to
[01:39.840 --> 01:48.040]  get into grooves, expand regional grooves. All signs point pretty extensively to New
[01:48.040 --> 01:53.280]  York. Yeah. Yeah. That's a market we could get into. It's like, I don't know if you've
[01:53.280 --> 01:59.580]  seen there are these songs. Maybe it was only Canada, but I'd assume it would be larger
[01:59.580 --> 02:05.300]  than that. There were these songs or was like Alberta is the place to be. And then it would
[02:05.300 --> 02:10.280]  be like listing all the great things about Alberta. And people would be like, oh, the
[02:10.280 --> 02:15.560]  Alberta song. As someone from Alberta, I connect to this. And then realizing that somebody
[02:15.560 --> 02:21.040]  just made that for every province in Canada and that there's slightly altered versions
[02:21.040 --> 02:26.600]  of the same song. And they just sold them to different places. And how disappointing.
[02:26.760 --> 02:31.440]  I think it was this American life about that. I want to say a long time ago. So people didn't
[02:31.440 --> 02:36.080]  realize until they moved to a different. That a person like realizing because it's literally
[02:36.080 --> 02:41.760]  the exact same song and with a lot of the same shared words. But there's like sections
[02:41.760 --> 02:47.460]  where they localize it just slightly and like reference like one or two specific things to
[02:47.460 --> 02:52.980]  that area. And so people being like very patriotic about like, yeah, this is a song about
[02:52.980 --> 02:57.840]  our place and how great our place is and it exists because our place is great. And then
[02:57.840 --> 03:04.960]  realizing, oh, this person just manufactured and sold packaged these songs for every area
[03:04.960 --> 03:11.460]  of Canada. I assume they go beyond that. That would be crazy if every country had the same
[03:11.460 --> 03:20.560]  national anthem, but with different words. Oh, man, I wish I had never done all the I've
[03:20.560 --> 03:24.980]  done the state songs. I was trying to think of like of the national anthems, what would
[03:24.980 --> 03:32.120]  be the best song to build around musically? Hmm. It'd be an interesting thing to I should
[03:32.120 --> 03:39.840]  I should try to listen to some more anthems. Maybe the Oh, Canada one. Hmm. Because it says
[03:39.840 --> 03:46.360]  the name like the U.S. one doesn't say United States in it. No, I'm saying the music. Oh,
[03:46.820 --> 03:53.860]  like if you take the music of OK, I don't think the music in Canada is great. I think the
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.400]  American anthems are there's more going on musically than the Canadian one. You like a
[03:59.400 --> 04:05.000]  bit of Star Spangled? I don't really like any of them, if I'm being completely honest. As somebody
[04:05.000 --> 04:10.200]  who watches sporting events like it, I just I'm sick of it. I was sitting here trying to get pumped
[04:10.200 --> 04:16.900]  up by it in my head. They're all just real boring. It's just real boring old timey music. There are
[04:16.900 --> 04:21.320]  some state songs that are bangers. I feel like there's probably some anthems that are surprisingly
[04:21.320 --> 04:27.200]  good, but not many. You're going through a lot of just the same to get there. I feel like we need a
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.320]  music refresh where maybe we're like, oh, it's classical music is classical. It's old. Let's let's
[04:33.320 --> 04:40.100]  freshen up a bit. Let's put some guitars in there. I've hit. It's funny, you know, like as you get
[04:40.100 --> 04:45.820]  older, there are different small milestones of like, oh, wow, I'm getting older. And like the
[04:45.820 --> 04:51.040]  first one I can remember is watching the NHL draft and realizing I'm a year older than all these
[04:51.040 --> 04:55.560]  people getting picked. That was the first like, oh, fuck, I'm getting older. This is weird. I hit
[04:55.560 --> 05:04.540]  a new one recently where Avril Lavigne is releasing a greatest hits album. And it's the first artist
[05:04.540 --> 05:10.800]  that I'm aware of that I can remember buying their first CD and then having a full enough career to
[05:10.800 --> 05:19.180]  then warrant a greatest hits CD. It was a strange like, oh, fuck, time has passed. That is weird. I
[05:19.180 --> 05:24.540]  distinctly remember having the first Avril Lavigne CD and be like, skater boys, great. This is
[05:24.540 --> 05:32.060]  awesome. And to now get ads for her greatest hits, be like, oh, fuck, she has had a whole life. It
[05:32.060 --> 05:39.280]  has been a whole career of music. That's crazy. It must be so weird to live through. That like
[05:39.280 --> 05:44.680]  career sort of decline until you become nostalgic and then all your music gets used again, like
[05:45.380 --> 05:52.680]  Sophie Ellis Baxter or that was that one in Stranger Things, Kate Bush. Oh, yeah. Coming back
[05:52.680 --> 05:57.340]  to the front of just like, oh, my God, must be such a weird feeling. I remember reading an article
[05:57.340 --> 06:02.320]  recently that the band Yellowcard is huge again, and they were interviewing them and they were
[06:02.320 --> 06:08.220]  like, we have no idea why. We really don't know what's going on, but we're just we appreciate it.
[06:08.420 --> 06:14.600]  But yeah, like we had no fucking clue. So weird. It's interesting how social media and the internet
[06:14.600 --> 06:19.560]  have really made that kind of thing possible in a way that it wasn't really in the past. You know,
[06:19.840 --> 06:24.340]  it's a lot easier to find things from the past and to latch onto them and have them take
[06:25.140 --> 06:27.920]  prominence in the in the present in a way that it didn't used to be.
[06:28.580 --> 06:34.400]  Sure. TikTok helps a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, sure. It's 90 percent of it. TikTok and Instagram.
[06:35.380 --> 06:40.680]  So I knew we were going to do two episodes today, and I mentioned this at the tail end of last
[06:40.680 --> 06:45.520]  episode. I've had a real boring life the last week. I'm real sorry. No house problems. God,
[06:45.580 --> 06:49.680]  I wish I did. I wish I had like some sort of a house issue I could share with you guys or whatever.
[06:49.840 --> 06:53.900]  But, you know, things are just working real good here for Jeff on his end. And it's been pretty
[06:53.900 --> 06:59.600]  bog standard. So I tried to I just haven't had anything interesting to talk about. So I did one
[06:59.600 --> 07:03.080]  of those bike rides where I decided today is going to be a bike ride where I'm going to observe the
[07:03.080 --> 07:06.880]  world and I'm going to take in everything that I noticed and I'm going to find the interesting
[07:06.880 --> 07:11.580]  insights and things that are out there. I've done this, I think, twice before. I've done it
[07:11.580 --> 07:15.860]  in face. I don't know. I haven't done it in regulation yet. And here are my insights,
[07:15.860 --> 07:19.300]  if you guys are interested in them at all. Yeah. Yes. I would love to hear them.
[07:19.600 --> 07:27.000]  I don't know what the little yellow triangle flags are on bike trails or in parks or like when
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.560]  they're in construction sites. But if I could figure out what purpose they serve, I think I
[07:31.560 --> 07:35.680]  could abuse it because I see them everywhere. And I think if I could get a hold of a bunch of them,
[07:35.680 --> 07:40.240]  I could use it to some nefarious means. I just got to figure out what they're doing.
[07:40.740 --> 07:43.340]  Do you have a picture of one? No, but I'll take a picture next time.
[07:44.080 --> 07:47.820]  I know that it's like the ones they use for gas lines and stuff. Like in my old yard,
[07:47.920 --> 07:52.420]  my old house, I had to get my gas lines marked. Oh, like a little thin stick with a tiny little...
[07:52.420 --> 07:56.380]  Yeah, like a little bendy metal stick with a vinyl yellow flag. But they're everywhere,
[07:56.540 --> 08:00.800]  like in parks and stuff. They clearly denote stuff, but I don't know what. But I want to
[08:01.260 --> 08:05.320]  figure it out and take advantage of it, if that makes sense. Yeah. Eric's got a quick picture.
[08:05.820 --> 08:10.020]  Well, take advantage of it. What do you mean by that?
[08:10.720 --> 08:14.520]  I don't know. I got to figure out what they do so I can figure out how to use them to my advantage.
[08:15.020 --> 08:19.420]  So you could potentially... I was thinking you could just draw people off the...
[08:19.920 --> 08:23.880]  Yeah. The regular path towards like a hot dog stand that you own or something.
[08:24.040 --> 08:29.140]  What if you... Yeah, you funneled them towards your coffee shop or your smoothie shop or whatever.
[08:29.460 --> 08:35.000]  Or what if you just wanted a private section of park for yourself? Maybe you could just draw them
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.080]  away and create like a little oasis for you. Who knows? Oh, Nick's got a great point. The
[08:40.080 --> 08:45.180]  lemonade stand. Lemonade stand. There you go. That's a fucking great one right there. That's
[08:45.180 --> 08:49.580]  perfect. Let's do it. And even the flags are yellow like lemonade. That's right. Yeah. Or pink.
[08:49.640 --> 08:56.740]  But then say... Or pink like lemonade. They got their twins. Say you start understanding what the
[08:56.740 --> 09:03.500]  flags are. Nobody else necessarily knows. Look, I just assume they're just denoting like a line was
[09:03.500 --> 09:08.580]  laid under there or something. Like, I don't know. I assume more people than... I assume that
[09:08.580 --> 09:12.040]  there are people out there that know what they mean. And whatever they mean, they mean like go
[09:12.040 --> 09:16.680]  this way or that way. I just figure they have a purpose. And if I could figure out what their
[09:16.680 --> 09:22.420]  actual purpose is, I could pervert that purpose. You know that... Have you heard of the app that's
[09:22.420 --> 09:28.460]  it's called something like what three something? What's it called? Three words? No. What?
[09:28.460 --> 09:37.640]  What? I think it's called what three words. And it's like segmented the earth up into different
[09:38.460 --> 09:45.280]  like three by three cubes or something. But each one has a name made up of three words. And I
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.460]  wonder if you could find the square that's like best lemonade stand and like put the
[09:51.460 --> 09:56.640]  lemonade stand right there. So let me see if I can get this image working in here.
[09:56.640 --> 10:03.040]  Uh, I understand what he's saying. Yeah. It's it's segmented everything up like this.
[10:03.940 --> 10:09.420]  Yeah, like the whole planet has three words attached to it. Words randomly assigned like
[10:09.420 --> 10:17.580]  the corner of on this image Hyde Park Place is Price Buck Nurses. Yeah. So you could be like,
[10:17.940 --> 10:24.080]  you can meet me at Bird Inches Coast. Like meet me there. It's like a really specific
[10:24.720 --> 10:30.960]  spot on the planet. I've never heard of this. I don't know what this is.
[10:31.380 --> 10:38.040]  I've never heard of this ever, ever. If you want to have someone deliver something to a
[10:38.040 --> 10:45.680]  pretty weird spot, it's good for dead drops. Table decks bring. Okay. And so they have the
[10:45.680 --> 10:53.080]  whole world segmented like this. Yeah. That's crazy. Like down to like your own toilet will
[10:53.080 --> 10:59.640]  be in one. You could be like, I take all my shits in. Bliss teeth exams. So then I just give you the
[10:59.640 --> 11:03.160]  name Bliss teeth exams and you type it into that search engine and it pulls up that spot on the
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.860]  map. Yeah. Give me a spot, Jeff. Like what's like an Austin spot and I'll see if I can find it.
[11:08.080 --> 11:11.820]  Like, I mean, I'll, I'll search it here, but like, we'll, we'll get like what the word is for it.
[11:12.040 --> 11:16.060]  Like give me like a place you go to or something like a restaurant or somewhere you like. Yeah.
[11:16.060 --> 11:22.560]  Yeah. Yeah. How about just, uh, how about Desnudo coffee? Or is that too specific? Should I just
[11:22.560 --> 11:30.700]  give you a location? No, no, no, no, no. It's it's good. Desnudo coffee is, hang on, I'm zooming in, assorted
[11:30.700 --> 11:41.520]  back armed, assorted back arms. This is crazy. I've never heard of this. Should we only communicate
[11:41.520 --> 11:47.880]  directions locally going forward in this method? Like I'll meet, I'll meet you guys at Banana
[11:47.880 --> 11:54.420]  Coast strawberry or whatever. It's so secret. You can type in stuff that you think might exist
[11:54.420 --> 12:00.120]  and not all, not all of the combinations do, but this is what I typed in for eat the pencil.
[12:01.560 --> 12:08.440]  And it's a place in Austin. No way. Oh wow. Eat's Home Pencil is in the river.
[12:09.740 --> 12:16.260]  Wow. You had a jet ski to Eat's Home Pencil. Maybe if it takes you to the local one. I rode my bike
[12:16.260 --> 12:22.100]  by there an hour ago. That's so funny. So maybe if there's no exact match, it will find the nearest
[12:22.100 --> 12:29.320]  one to you that is similar. So that one had Eat's and Pencil. We should try and find the most
[12:29.320 --> 12:35.680]  regulation square on the planet. Yeah. Maybe the listeners can help us with some funny combinations
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.600]  that exist. Oh my God, we should find out what the center of the face universe is called. Oh,
[12:41.600 --> 12:48.440]  in Deputy, Indiana. Okay. Let, let me see. Let me see right now. Deputy, Indiana.
[12:49.240 --> 12:56.100]  And then, oh my God, can we just make our, I, I know if, can we make our first t-shirt just be
[12:56.100 --> 13:02.140]  those three names, whatever they are. Oh, I love it. The problem is we have to figure out where
[13:02.140 --> 13:09.780]  the spot is in Deputy, Indiana, and then we have to assign words because man, it could be anything.
[13:09.780 --> 13:17.180]  It could be chain qualify leading. It could be international crackle description. You could go,
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.240]  you can go to the, it looks like the, uh, the cemetery that's right there. Uh, that's bribed
[13:23.240 --> 13:34.220]  vindicated songs. So, I mean, there, there's a lot. Standard ears face. What? That is crazy.
[13:34.640 --> 13:39.140]  Say that again, please. Standard ears face. Yes. Oh, it's in, uh, what country is this?
[13:39.140 --> 13:44.740]  This is somewhere far. Oh, it's in China. We're in China. Oh yeah.
[13:46.580 --> 13:51.200]  I thought standard years faces and deputy for a minute. I was about to lose. Oh my God,
[13:51.540 --> 13:58.700]  dude, that would've been crazy. This is awesome. I've never heard of this. Oh yeah. It's a useful
[13:58.700 --> 14:07.360]  tool. Wow. Is it? Yeah. As long as both parties know, right? Well, I've done, I've done shoots in
[14:07.360 --> 14:11.580]  pretty obscure places where it's like, just come to this square. Like if you can't find the entrance
[14:11.580 --> 14:18.540]  to this forest or something. Totally. It makes complete sense. Dang, this is crazy. So how do
[14:18.540 --> 14:25.820]  you search by the, by the names? You just type in, you just type in names. Or, or three word address.
[14:26.120 --> 14:32.420]  Weird. Yeah. So like dog, fart, book. I don't think fart would be. Fart is probably not going
[14:32.420 --> 14:41.400]  to be one. Dog, food, book, no address phone. Weird. That is so fucking cool. That is awesome.
[14:42.240 --> 14:50.060]  How often do you guys realize that you've misheard lyrics? Constantly. Constantly? Okay, good.
[14:50.500 --> 15:00.620]  Glad. Mine today was Chicago's 25 or six to four. I thought it was 250624. Oh. Like numbers. I
[15:00.620 --> 15:06.640]  thought it was like a phone number. It's useless. It's nonsense either way. Yeah. Is it? Okay. Yeah.
[15:07.140 --> 15:13.920]  What are they saying? It's either 25 minutes or 26. 25 or six to four. Yeah. 25 or six to four.
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.020]  Like it's three 30 something. Sure. Yeah, sure.
[15:23.260 --> 15:27.280]  You know what? You know what I was noticing on my bike ride? That doesn't make sense.
[15:28.640 --> 15:34.620]  What? Sorry, I forgot we're on your bike ride thing. We went so deep in that I completely
[15:34.620 --> 15:39.160]  forgot. I don't fucking. I don't think 25 or 64 means anything. I think they're on drugs.
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.700]  Yeah, I bet it means. I thought they would tell the time. I think the whole song is about them
[15:44.700 --> 15:50.760]  being fucked up, isn't it? What does 25 or 64? Yeah, they were like Nick says they were up late
[15:50.760 --> 15:56.660]  on drugs. Didn't know the time. Yeah. The time at which the song is set, 25 or 26 minutes before
[15:56.660 --> 16:03.080]  I am. Doesn't matter anyway, when you bike ride, tell me about what's so it's about. It's about
[16:03.080 --> 16:14.280]  those two times, maybe. Oops. No, that's wrong. I mistyped one of them. They're saying 25 or 26
[16:14.280 --> 16:19.660]  to four o'clock. Oh, is that? No, I think that's what they're saying. Oh, 25 or six.
[16:19.660 --> 16:26.940]  OK, thank you. Five or six. Got it for. Oh, God. So what times would that be?
[16:28.080 --> 16:36.160]  Uh, 30, 25, 334. Yeah, yeah. That was half right. So you almost got it when you edited,
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.340]  but it's wrong. It's pretty cool. There you are. Look at you. Hey, Gavin,
[16:42.340 --> 16:51.460]  way to go. Third time's a charm, buddy. Oh, God. I don't think the person who invented
[16:51.980 --> 16:57.940]  the picnic table gets enough credit. Do you think the guy that invented or I'm assuming guy,
[16:57.980 --> 17:06.060]  because it's old, um, the table? Well, I just I feel I don't know, whatever. The past is inherently
[17:06.060 --> 17:11.420]  misogynistic. Yes. Yeah, I get it. That was the point I was trying to make. Um, do you think they
[17:11.420 --> 17:17.540]  invented all of it or do you think they just combined like they didn't invent the stool or
[17:17.540 --> 17:22.000]  what? They're not stool, but no, like the. I think it was the. Oh, here we go. The first known
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.580]  modern picnic table was documented in a 1903 patent application by Charles H. Nielsen of
[17:27.580 --> 17:31.760]  Chryslerville, New York. So that's what I'm talking about. I'd never heard of Charles H.
[17:31.840 --> 17:40.560]  Nielsen. Nobody has. But everywhere you go, there is a picnic table in nine times out of 10. It is
[17:40.560 --> 17:48.260]  the exact same fucking design like that. He he landed on a standard regulation picnic table and
[17:48.260 --> 17:53.360]  the world just said, good enough. There's like there's the one that's metal that's got like
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.100]  perforated metal circles and it's like covered in rubber. You see those occasionally. But 99%
[17:58.100 --> 18:03.040]  of the time, it's that same bog standard wooden picnic table. We have not improved or innovated
[18:03.040 --> 18:08.920]  on that design. And like since 1903, I just think it's wild that we just all use it and they're
[18:08.920 --> 18:14.000]  everywhere. And nobody thinks about how we just have one kind of picnic table that we all just
[18:14.000 --> 18:18.880]  kind of adopted. So for it to qualify, is it just a table with benches attached to the table with
[18:18.880 --> 18:22.920]  an umbrella hole in the middle? Uh, I wouldn't even say it has to have the umbrella hole.
[18:23.940 --> 18:27.540]  Okay. So potentially the picnic table is a product of the New York groove.
[18:30.740 --> 18:35.360]  It's like one of the grooviest tables, maybe. Yeah, no, that's interesting. That's interesting.
[18:35.360 --> 18:42.480]  Is New York groove about the picnic table? Many years since I've been here. 1903 to be specific.
[18:42.980 --> 18:46.720]  You just don't ever think about picnic tables, but man, they're everywhere. I saw a bunch of
[18:46.720 --> 18:51.640]  dude, homeless people sleeping on them today. I saw a bunch of people having lunch on them.
[18:51.840 --> 18:56.780]  I saw some kids playing on them. I saw some dude working out of his laptop on one. And it's just
[18:56.780 --> 19:02.040]  like, they're just everywhere. Let me expand this, Jeff. I'm looking at my desk right now.
[19:02.040 --> 19:07.740]  I couldn't tell you who invented a single thing. Yeah, it's true. But I just feel like when you
[19:07.740 --> 19:12.740]  think picnic table, you think of this exact same, I would say most of us think of the exact same
[19:12.740 --> 19:17.340]  table in our heads. I just feel like it's weird that there's only like really one, you know,
[19:18.060 --> 19:21.520]  it's just like this accepted thing. And we just don't, I don't know. I don't even know
[19:21.520 --> 19:24.120]  where to buy one, but they're everywhere. Like, where do you go to get a picnic table?
[19:24.680 --> 19:29.380]  Home Depot? Who sells picnic tables? But somehow they're everywhere. Where do they come from?
[19:29.380 --> 19:34.180]  Who makes them? Who manufactures all these picnic tables? Do you think they were iterated from the
[19:34.180 --> 19:39.260]  blanket? Like people just got sick of sitting on the floor? Oh, do you think the original form of
[19:39.260 --> 19:43.820]  the picnic table is a blanket? Maybe before the 1903, they would just sit on the ground.
[19:44.340 --> 19:49.360]  Yeah. Do you think the first version, it was just a table? They're like, this doesn't work.
[19:49.840 --> 19:55.780]  We need, we need to iterate on this. How do we do? It's just people sitting on the floor while
[19:55.780 --> 20:02.940]  tables above them. This doesn't solve the problem at all. This is a huge mistake.
[20:04.380 --> 20:10.460]  Anyway, that was a, that was an observation I had. Also, I think that the city of Austin is
[20:10.460 --> 20:16.460]  in its graffiti flop era. The graffiti in Austin is very uninspired and kind of lame right now.
[20:16.740 --> 20:20.420]  All the Kung Fu grips and all the cool stuff are gone. And it's just a bunch of people writing
[20:20.420 --> 20:24.260]  shit over shit that somebody else wrote. And it just looks like a big mushy mess.
[20:25.080 --> 20:30.740]  What else did I learn? Oh, here's one. Every single person on earth has a six pack, but Jeff
[20:30.740 --> 20:37.900]  noticed that today. God damn. I always thought when I was younger, I always used to look at
[20:37.900 --> 20:42.080]  people like Blaine and be like, Oh, I could probably do that one day if I really, you know,
[20:42.080 --> 20:48.680]  dedicated time to it and really committed to eating right. And now I'm 36 and I have to come to terms
[20:48.680 --> 20:52.640]  with the fact that every time I see Blaine, I just come to terms with the fact that that will never
[20:52.640 --> 20:59.600]  be me. That's what I've been saying. I said that last week to you. That you'll never be Blaine?
[21:00.360 --> 21:04.980]  Yeah. What? You're talking about getting jacked. And I said, respectfully, who do you think you
[21:04.980 --> 21:09.380]  are? That's not a world we live in. Oh, I've been making that point for a while. I could have told
[21:09.380 --> 21:15.060]  you that back then. That's not you. It is weird, though. Like I spent two and a half hours riding
[21:15.060 --> 21:20.640]  my bike, about three hours riding my bike this morning. I ran into, I don't know, 2000 people
[21:20.640 --> 21:26.080]  on the hike and bike trail in that three hours. How am I the only one without a six pack?
[21:27.400 --> 21:32.480]  There are dudes 85 years old running in Austin with a six pack. There are women in their 90s
[21:32.480 --> 21:38.300]  with like 12 packs. There are fucking homeless dudes who look like personal trainers. Like
[21:38.300 --> 21:45.080]  everywhere I turn, people look amazing. And then my dumpy ass riding a bicycle. I just think that
[21:45.080 --> 21:53.440]  was an observation. And then my headphones died. And then I was real bummed because I was about
[21:53.440 --> 21:58.820]  90 minutes into a three hour ride and my headphones died. And I thought, oh, maybe this is
[21:58.820 --> 22:05.880]  an opportunity to listen to the world around me. I just had this wild zombie cranberries experience.
[22:06.320 --> 22:11.040]  Maybe this is the universe saying, hey, we drained your batteries because something fucking fascinating
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.240]  is about to happen on your bike ride and we want you to be alert for it, right? So for the next 90
[22:16.240 --> 22:21.240]  minutes, I fucking, I just zoned into the world around me and I wanted to take in everything I
[22:21.240 --> 22:28.780]  could see, find anything interesting. And let me tell you, over the next 90 minutes, not a goddamn
[22:28.780 --> 22:34.960]  thing on the planet earth happened. Not a sound of consequence was made. There was no point in
[22:34.960 --> 22:40.580]  listening to or hearing anything. It was the most boring 90 minutes on earth. As a matter of fact,
[22:40.580 --> 22:45.920]  I was thinking about this. You could, if you could get some white out, you could just scrub out, just
[22:45.920 --> 22:50.820]  paint over that part of the timeline. I don't think anybody on earth would notice or miss that
[22:50.820 --> 22:57.040]  90 minutes. It was the most useless 90 minutes in the history of our planet. And that got me thinking,
[22:57.880 --> 23:01.760]  how much of our lives are useless? Eric and I have both been talking recently about how we're
[23:01.760 --> 23:05.860]  walking our dogs lately and about how much we like to walk our dogs and how much fun it is to
[23:05.860 --> 23:10.120]  walk our dogs. I'm walking my dog like three or four times a day right now. And Eric's walking
[23:10.120 --> 23:14.140]  his dog a couple of times a day, I assume. And I got to thinking about how I spend time that way
[23:14.140 --> 23:22.340]  and how much I walk my dog and how that all bleeds together. And I bet if you took a 10 second clip
[23:22.340 --> 23:28.280]  of me walking Albert, maybe took all the 10 second clips of me walking Albert over the last two weeks
[23:28.280 --> 23:32.480]  and then jumbled them up and told me to put them in chronological order, or you would kill me,
[23:32.620 --> 23:38.840]  I'd be dead in five minutes. So much of our lives are not worth remembering. That's all. That was
[23:38.840 --> 23:45.040]  my observation. There was someone somewhere there losing their virginity in that time window,
[23:45.040 --> 23:50.200]  and you want to take that away from them? Not in Austin. They were doing they were
[23:50.200 --> 23:55.420]  fucking doing nothing. They were walking quietly and making no noise and doing nothing interesting.
[23:55.960 --> 24:00.700]  This summer, try the new Strato Frappuccino blended beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[24:00.700 --> 24:06.140]  blended iced coffee you know and love, now topped with a creamy layer of handcrafted brown sugar cold
[24:06.140 --> 24:10.680]  available for a limited time. Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[24:11.980 --> 24:16.940]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm. Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is
[24:16.940 --> 24:21.960]  a great feeling. And when it comes to checking off coverage, a State Farm agent can help you
[24:21.960 --> 24:26.340]  choose an option that's right for you. Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone,

[24:30.800 --> 24:34.120]  best fits your needs. Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[24:36.820 --> 24:41.040]  How, you know, like multiple people die every second and get born and stuff. How often does
[24:41.040 --> 24:46.680]  someone lose their virginity? Okay, so you're still on like this weirdo guy trait. So yeah,
[24:47.340 --> 24:53.460]  just real double, triple down on the weird this episode. Is that weird? Yeah, it is. It's a stat.
[24:53.700 --> 24:59.480]  Yeah, but it's not a fun... there's a lot of bad directions to take that stat.
[25:02.660 --> 25:09.020]  It is a stat I would not want to explore. Without Gavin getting all weird and sexual about it,
[25:09.560 --> 25:14.600]  I just... it got me thinking about how much of our lives we are just kind of... don't matter.
[25:14.860 --> 25:19.440]  And that if you just like fucking mind wipe them with the Men in Black pen, you wouldn't even
[25:19.440 --> 25:23.780]  notice. I don't even remember what clothes I was wearing two days ago. How would I remember
[25:23.780 --> 25:28.860]  which dog walk it was, you know? It's why TV episodes are 42 minutes long, Jeff.
[25:28.860 --> 25:33.340]  It's really hard to have a bunch of interesting stuff happen in a sequence.
[25:33.700 --> 25:39.460]  You would think in the middle of the 11th largest city in America for 90 minutes in public,
[25:39.620 --> 25:44.600]  riding through downtown and all over the city, that I would... one thing would happen.
[25:45.100 --> 25:54.740]  Well, it's the issue of what is regular becomes mundane, right? Maybe it's a perspective thing
[25:54.740 --> 25:59.240]  of what is interesting. You've been in Austin for such a long time. It's a lot of the same.
[25:59.340 --> 26:03.600]  I mean, Austin's always changing, but like, I feel like it's a city you're very familiar with,
[26:03.680 --> 26:09.200]  obviously. I think maybe what would be unique or interesting to you is a narrower range
[26:09.200 --> 26:12.440]  than if you were just visiting Austin for the first time.
[26:12.780 --> 26:19.920]  I understand what you're saying, but I was evaluating it on a more of a just I need to
[26:19.920 --> 26:24.040]  come up with something silly to talk about. And there's just like, you know what I mean? Like I
[26:24.920 --> 26:27.820]  don't think I was looking at it through an Austinite's eyes and more of a just like,
[26:27.940 --> 26:33.200]  could somebody trip or like have some poop on the back of their shorts or maybe somebody get into a
[26:33.200 --> 26:38.100]  yelling match on their phone while they're walking or you know what I mean? Like anything, maybe
[26:38.100 --> 26:41.980]  somebody bumps somebody, somebody gets a flat tire on their bike and I can stop and help them or
[26:41.980 --> 26:45.020]  something. Fuck, just anything, you know? Well, someone's trailing a gas pump.
[26:45.700 --> 26:51.340]  Or someone's trailing a gas pump. Exactly. I didn't see a single car trailing a single gas pump.
[26:51.860 --> 26:59.040]  You said that your headphones died and I really appreciate headphone technology now,
[26:59.180 --> 27:04.760]  like Bluetooth, whatever, wireless, all that stuff. I stay on top of charging all my stuff.
[27:04.980 --> 27:11.160]  I make sure everything's good to go all the time, except my wireless headphones. And I don't know
[27:11.160 --> 27:19.180]  why that is, but I can't think of a time that I get madder than when I'm about to do this thing,
[27:19.180 --> 27:25.260]  like mow my lawn or whatever, put in the headphones, they connect and then like immediately
[27:25.260 --> 27:30.900]  die. And now I don't know what, like, what's the plan? Well, to be honest, you could probably just
[27:30.900 --> 27:36.880]  charge them for like four minutes and there would be enough to mow a lawn. I, uh, the lawn was an
[27:36.880 --> 27:44.360]  example. It could be, it could be any number of activities. I wasn't looking to solve one
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.780]  individual thing. That was just an example. In general, the batteries are tiny. They charge
[27:49.780 --> 27:54.340]  very fast. And when you're running out the door, you may not have time to charge them.
[27:54.560 --> 27:59.760]  It's just, it's, it's that kind of a thing where I, it's just like, I don't, I don't know why it's
[27:59.760 --> 28:05.640]  the only device that I own where you have a blind spot to it. And it makes me so fucking mad.
[28:05.760 --> 28:10.820]  Are they annoying to charge? No, I mean, they're just there. It's AirPods. So they're fine. It's,
[28:10.820 --> 28:17.320]  but it's on, I have the iPhone with the USB-C, so I have to find the USB other thing,
[28:17.820 --> 28:22.800]  lightning or whatever to charge it. And it's just like, this sucks. It fucking sucks shit. I hate
[28:22.800 --> 28:29.060]  it. Do you have any wireless ones? He just said he had AirPods. Not like wireless charger? No,
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.600]  no, just in my car. Oh, okay. Yeah. I have a wireless charger. They're not great. Um,
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.840]  I'm actually in a bit of headphone hell right now, uh, which is part of, part of the problem.
[28:39.400 --> 28:47.160]  My, my AirPods fucking died. Like they just stopped sinking to anything. You cannot factory
[28:47.160 --> 28:52.380]  reset everything you can do. You just cannot, they just will not sink to an item. No, no matter how
[28:52.380 --> 28:55.640]  charged they are, no matter how many times I go through it, I try to do it. They just won't
[28:55.640 --> 29:01.220]  fucking sink. And so I was borrowing Emily's for, oh gosh, about two months there. And then
[29:01.220 --> 29:05.180]  eventually I think she got sick of it. Now I just can't find Emily's anymore. They're suddenly not
[29:05.180 --> 29:11.740]  around. And so the other day at the airport, I bought a pair of like $30 fake, uh, AirPods,
[29:12.020 --> 29:17.680]  you know, and they'd been fine up until today. I, and I, Eric, I fully charge, they're supposed
[29:17.680 --> 29:22.360]  to have five hour battery life and I fully charged them before the bike ride and they died 90
[29:22.360 --> 29:26.480]  minutes in. And I would rather, I would like to just go buy new AirPods, but they're announcing
[29:26.480 --> 29:31.280]  new AirPods in September or August. And so I don't want to spend 190 bucks or however much they
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.620]  cost, 300 bucks to then have them be obsolete or to be able to buy the current generation for a
[29:36.620 --> 29:39.420]  hundred bucks off or whatever, because there's a new, you know what I mean? So I just got to
[29:39.420 --> 29:43.340]  fucking wait. And I'm in this weird headphone holding period where I can't find my wife's
[29:43.340 --> 29:47.060]  headphones because I think she's sick of letting me borrow them, which I totally understand.
[29:47.220 --> 29:52.080]  I did find Millie's AirPods, but Millie's left ear is blown out. So I can't use those. They're
[29:52.080 --> 29:57.120]  fucking terrible. I got my own pair of AirPods that about once a week I sit down and try to make
[29:57.120 --> 30:01.960]  work again in a futile effort of thinking like maybe time fixed the problem and it never does.
[30:02.060 --> 30:06.060]  And then these cheap ones that I thought worked, now I apparently only have a 90 minute battery
[30:06.060 --> 30:10.380]  life, which fucking sucks because they advertised five hours. But what am I going to do? I paid 30
[30:10.380 --> 30:16.320]  bucks for them. And it's August 1st. So I just got to wait. I just got to wait until Apple tells me
[30:16.320 --> 30:22.540]  I can buy a new thing. I had the exact same thing like a year ago where one of my AirPods, I'd had
[30:22.540 --> 30:28.480]  two different ones because one of them, the, uh, the left ear went really quiet and I would have to
[30:28.480 --> 30:33.620]  like, uh, manually change the balance of left and right to make them even out until eventually it
[30:33.620 --> 30:39.020]  got too quiet to use. So then I bought another pair and I lost the left. I lost the right
[30:39.020 --> 30:46.340]  AirPod. So I ended up combining one of two, one of each pair in the same box, but it freaking hates
[30:46.340 --> 30:51.600]  that. And the only way to get them to work is then I pair my AirPods to it. And then I have to share
[30:51.600 --> 30:57.720]  my audio with the other AirPod. And it's just, it was an annoying shit show for about six months.
[30:57.860 --> 31:01.680]  And I just should have bought another pair of them. I just refused because I already had two
[31:01.680 --> 31:06.880]  and I couldn't get a single good listening experience. I hate that kind of limbo living
[31:06.880 --> 31:12.880]  where to save 200 bucks or whatever, you just put yourself through months of inconvenience.
[31:13.320 --> 31:18.300]  I do it all the time for no reason. When it's all said and done, I will have gone through
[31:18.300 --> 31:25.720]  five months of bullshit to get a new pair of headphones just to save a couple hundred bucks.
[31:25.900 --> 31:31.680]  Yeah, it's fucking stupid, but it is what it is. This is where we are. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not,
[31:31.680 --> 31:37.700]  I'm too fucking close to the end of the road to break now and buy the headphones in a moment
[31:37.700 --> 31:43.060]  of desperation. I'm just going to soldier fucking through. It just sucks. Yeah. You gotta stick with
[31:43.060 --> 31:47.320]  it. Yeah. And then something will pop up in your house where it's like, well, now my air conditioner
[31:47.320 --> 31:52.080]  is busted because of the EMP. So I'm probably going to have to spend like eight airpods worth
[31:52.080 --> 32:00.000]  of money on just getting that. I can't imagine not having AC in Austin. Terrible. Yeah, it's
[32:00.000 --> 32:04.740]  not good. That would not be good. Going back to your point, Jeff, about six packs and everyone
[32:04.740 --> 32:09.360]  has them but you. It made me think, I looked it up. Well, you're saying that because you're,
[32:09.480 --> 32:13.480]  you know, it sounded like you were like, damn, why don't I have one of those? You know, you can
[32:13.480 --> 32:20.380]  have up to a 12 pack. Yeah. I don't know that I want one. I just noticed that everybody has one
[32:20.380 --> 32:25.980]  but me. Well, I'm just, I'm throwing it out there. You can go up to 12 apparently. Yeah. Yeah.
[32:26.660 --> 32:30.040]  Where are these people slacking? They're only halfway there. Where did the 4 come from? Are
[32:30.040 --> 32:35.160]  they like above and below the regular 6? What do you mean 12? I don't know. I looked up,
[32:35.360 --> 32:41.000]  can, is there more than a 6 pack, which led me to an 8 pack, which then led me to a 10 pack,
[32:41.000 --> 32:47.160]  which then led me to a thing that said you could have at most a 12 pack. 25 or 6 pack? Yeah.
[32:49.020 --> 32:57.600]  It's a 332 pack. Somewhere between 334 and 335 pack. I'm just saying, if you're looking at
[32:57.600 --> 33:03.300]  everybody else that has one, there's a lot more they could go for. It's true. They're slacking
[33:03.300 --> 33:08.920]  at 6. So most people who have a lovely 6 pack, they have the half the pack. They're only halfway
[33:08.920 --> 33:13.560]  there. You know what? I'm not going to call it a 6 pack anymore. I'm going to call it a 6 slack
[33:13.560 --> 33:19.280]  and it's going to be derogatory. Yeah, the half pack. I didn't know you could go to 12. That's
[33:19.280 --> 33:24.560]  insane. I don't know. I can't imagine. It's probably like a bodybuilder. As you said,
[33:24.640 --> 33:29.780]  like, I don't know where the 12 comes into place. I think by looking at Blaine recently and just
[33:29.780 --> 33:34.260]  deciding I'm giving up on my body, maybe I should just take it the other way and have it spur me on
[33:34.260 --> 33:38.700]  to try and get one. Just one time in my life. I wouldn't be able to maintain it, but maybe I'll
[33:38.700 --> 33:46.560]  be able to get to it. Do it. Andrew laughed. Do you think I can't do it? No, I was laughing
[33:46.560 --> 33:52.020]  just because I was imagining, you know, like Gerard Butler for 300 and how ripped he was for
[33:52.020 --> 33:58.920]  that window of time. Like it's you holding on like it's an actor taking on an action role
[33:58.920 --> 34:04.260]  and then just like they go back to what they their typical frame is. You could be the next
[34:04.260 --> 34:09.580]  Kumail Nanjiani. No, he's maintained. He's like he has maintained. I think that's like his
[34:09.580 --> 34:15.360]  lifestyle now, it seems. I went shoe shopping the other day with my wife while she went shoe shopping
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.840]  and I went with her and I was looking at shoes that I thought were interesting. And she asked
[34:19.840 --> 34:28.420]  me what shoe size I was. And I said I was a ten thirty. And then I realized that that broke my
[34:28.420 --> 34:34.440]  fucking brain for about a minute. I had to sit down and understand how how that was wrong and
[34:34.440 --> 34:39.660]  right at the same time and why it felt so wrong, but also so right to say and what the fuck I was.
[34:39.960 --> 34:45.620]  And it took me a minute to unpack. Like I really broke my head for a minute trying to figure out.
[34:45.820 --> 34:51.680]  You got confused with a clock. Yeah, where I'm a ten and a half and in my head that translated
[34:51.680 --> 34:56.200]  to ten thirty and I saw a clock in my head and that was right somehow, but I knew it wasn't right
[34:56.200 --> 35:01.320]  and I couldn't figure out why. And she looked at me like I was extra dumb. And I just, oh man,
[35:01.320 --> 35:04.820]  I had a moment where I was just like really confused by me. Have you guys ever done that?
[35:06.300 --> 35:09.680]  No. Maybe that's maybe Chicago were just confused about their shoe size.
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.840]  I'm a 15 minutes to two.
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.320]  It is weird to have to think of 30 as being 50 basically in a lot of scenarios.
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.500]  It is. It can definitely trip you up. Got my unit of measurement all confused with my
[35:28.500 --> 35:34.360]  unit of time. Oh man. This is what your 40s. This is what you have to look forward to in your 40s,
[35:34.400 --> 35:41.360]  guys. Oh, I can't wait. You just hot takes on picnic benches and fucking confusing.
[35:44.020 --> 35:47.880]  I would look into sending you a picnic bench, but you don't own a house now,
[35:47.920 --> 35:50.940]  which makes me realize I feel less comfortable sending you stuff like that.
[35:50.940 --> 35:56.320]  I'd have nowhere to put it. Yeah, it's sad. It's I do feel like a certain amount of safety
[35:56.320 --> 36:04.760]  in renting now from you specifically. I had a thought. I eat a lot of chicken.
[36:05.180 --> 36:10.060]  It's probably the food I've consumed the most of. I was wondering how many chickens I've killed.
[36:10.580 --> 36:16.080]  Not directly, but any time I've consumed chicken, that chicken has died.
[36:16.640 --> 36:21.240]  I think I probably kill 100 chickens a year, I would say, based on the frequency
[36:21.760 --> 36:26.300]  at which I'm eating chickens. If you had to kill them by hand, do you think you would eat as many?
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.300]  Uh, oh, that's. Yeah, I think so. I think the first few would probably be tough and then I
[36:32.300 --> 36:37.960]  would get past it real quick. You'd just be yanking on chicken heads. Yeah, yeah. I think
[36:38.480 --> 36:44.080]  because that's what people do. Like, I think it's once you are familiar with that process and get
[36:44.080 --> 36:50.000]  used to it. That's just life. I just couldn't do it. No, I think the first one. No, I'm with you,
[36:50.200 --> 36:55.080]  too. If something's got eyes big enough to look at mine, I don't think I can end the life.
[36:55.900 --> 37:01.180]  I think a chicken is dumb enough that it's OK. I agree. Now, here's the thing. I also agree with
[37:01.180 --> 37:05.780]  you, Andrew. Like, I would have a hard time doing it. But if there was an animal to do it to,
[37:05.840 --> 37:12.080]  it would be the dumbest animal, the chicken. It definitely feels weird being OK to eat an animal,
[37:12.080 --> 37:16.600]  but not being OK to kill it. You know, I think about that sometimes, for sure.
[37:17.640 --> 37:22.180]  I'm in the same boat. I don't think I could do it. What did Werner Herzog describe with chickens?
[37:23.280 --> 37:30.180]  What's that? The Werner Herzog quote on chickens. What it was like. Oh, here. Look into the eyes
[37:30.180 --> 37:34.340]  of a chicken. You will see real stupidity. It is a kind of bottomless stupidity,
[37:34.660 --> 37:37.700]  a fiendish stupidity. They're the most horrifying animal.
[37:40.900 --> 37:45.440]  I mean, he's not wrong. They're the most horrifying, cannibalistic and nightmarish
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.660]  creatures in the world. So, like, I feel fine about killing a chicken. Yeah, after reading it.
[37:49.700 --> 37:54.340]  No, I get it. Do you do you have like older relatives who tell you stories about like how
[37:54.340 --> 37:57.880]  they would had to like kill chickens growing up and stuff like that? Is that something that you
[37:57.880 --> 38:02.640]  ever talked like your grandparents about or anything? Killing chickens? Yeah. Like,
[38:02.660 --> 38:06.220]  was that you never heard stories about that stuff? I think so.
[38:07.200 --> 38:11.940]  Like my grandma grew up in like the Appalachian Mountains and she would tell us that when they
[38:11.940 --> 38:18.080]  were kids and it was time for like supper, their mom would tell them to go get a chicken and they
[38:18.080 --> 38:24.520]  would play the game of taking the chicken by the neck and swinging around to break its neck and
[38:24.520 --> 38:29.220]  then seeing where it ran around and landed. And that was the game to them. Oh, that's fun.
[38:29.680 --> 38:33.360]  That's what I'm saying. And like you, you eventually it normalizes.
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.780]  That's Andrew. That's why you're totally right. Like, again, I just don't know like where that
[38:38.780 --> 38:42.560]  threshold is for me and I don't want to find out. It's probably about seven chickens.
[38:44.600 --> 38:50.640]  Over under seven, seven and a half chickens over. Yeah, it's a it's a solid it's a solid
[38:50.640 --> 38:54.360]  week of chicken killing and then suddenly it becomes a game. Yeah. Andrew, what are the
[38:54.360 --> 38:59.520]  chicken vibes? Chicken vibes are great. All type chicken vibes. I was wondering for me,
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.860]  I think I've probably maintained around 100 average for at least the past 20 years.
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.500]  It's like 2000 chickens. Is there a single action character that has killed more people
[39:11.500 --> 39:17.260]  than I have consumed chickens? Oh, in a movie and like a series of film.
[39:17.380 --> 39:22.220]  I looked up Rambo. Rambo, surprisingly low kill count. Rambo is like 400.
[39:22.940 --> 39:28.940]  80s movies had much lower kill counts than you remember. I mean, Terminator 2 was partially
[39:28.940 --> 39:33.900]  famous because it had a kill count that was like 70 or something, which is nothing.
[39:34.400 --> 39:41.640]  What's Terminator 2 kill count? What about like Doctor Manhattan or something? I guess he doesn't
[39:41.640 --> 39:48.380]  kill everyone. He just gets framed as killing everyone. That's a lot of people. That is a lot
[39:48.380 --> 39:56.940]  of people die in 300. At least 299 of them. Yeah, OK. Not exactly what I meant, but I mean,
[39:56.940 --> 40:01.920]  I appreciate it. Thank you. There's a lot of people do die in that movie. Yeah, thanks, man.
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.160]  No, I appreciate it. I wonder, like, statistically, how many people like Nathan Drake is killed
[40:06.920 --> 40:11.560]  throughout that series? Oh, way more than way more than 2000. Just in the first one.
[40:12.080 --> 40:17.140]  Or like Master Chief. How many aliens? If you count like no respawning aliens,
[40:17.920 --> 40:21.880]  like those sections where they just keep coming unless you leave or whatever.
[40:22.600 --> 40:24.300]  Sounds like Jeff's smut novel.
[40:26.280 --> 40:31.380]  Oh, did you take a peek? A little early read? No, it's just I said you look at the press
[40:31.380 --> 40:35.600]  previews of the aliens and I just assume. Yeah, you're pretty. You're pretty on point.
[40:36.940 --> 40:43.860]  Hey, it's Paris. You know, I love sparkly things, right? Like stars. Duh. And thanks to Hilton and
[40:43.860 --> 40:50.480]  AutoCamp, I just slept under them. Picture me serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious
[40:50.480 --> 40:57.620]  Airstream, making s'mores with the kids while a national park is our backdrop. The great outdoors
[40:57.620 --> 41:05.340]  meets Hilton hospitality. That's hot. Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com. Hilton for the
[41:05.340 --> 41:12.500]  stay. A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days. Eight different settings,
[41:12.500 --> 41:20.380]  adjustable intensity. Plus it's heated and it just feels so good. Yes, a massage chair
[41:20.380 --> 41:27.100]  might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car, suddenly it seems quite practical.
[41:27.360 --> 41:33.500]  The all new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan, packed with premium features like available massaging front
[41:33.500 --> 41:40.780]  seats. It only feels extravagant. It's funny you say that about the chickens and how many you eat
[41:40.780 --> 41:45.480]  in a year. I was just doing the hot dog research the other day for Saul Wright, you know,
[41:46.760 --> 41:52.260]  because I'm definitely in my hot dog era. And I found a stat that I thought was fascinating that
[41:52.260 --> 41:54.860]  I did want to share with you guys. And this is a perfect time to share it. Do you know how many
[41:55.320 --> 42:02.560]  hot dogs the average American supposedly eats in a year? Oh, average American.
[42:03.420 --> 42:06.000]  10. How many do you think you eat in a year, Gavin?
[42:06.000 --> 42:11.700]  I only eat them at baseball games. I eat maybe five or six a year.
[42:12.460 --> 42:16.640]  I love hot dogs. I think about them more than a person should think about hot dogs.
[42:16.860 --> 42:22.660]  And I don't think I eat the average. I don't know how it's fucking possible this is the average.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.660]  Is it over a hundred? No. According to the internet,
[42:27.440 --> 42:33.860]  the Americans eat an average of 70 hot dogs per person per year.
[42:33.860 --> 42:41.920]  No fucking shot. No way. There's no way. That's it. That is on. That is on the National
[42:41.920 --> 42:49.840]  Hot Dog and Sausage Council website. Could we from this moment? It's August 1st today.
[42:50.840 --> 42:55.740]  Let's start counting from now till next August 1st. How many hot dogs we eat between this time?
[42:55.800 --> 42:59.760]  We'll have a dog count. Dog count. Oh, maybe we could have like a live count on a website
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.500]  somewhere. Yeah, we'll be dog counting. I like that. Do we want to share it or is it a thing
[43:04.500 --> 43:08.660]  where like we come back and say like, hey, I actually... No, let's share it. No, let's share
[43:08.660 --> 43:13.740]  it. I think, I think, yeah, I think keeping that tally going live, people go like, oh my God,
[43:13.780 --> 43:19.240]  Eric ate four hot dogs. Like what happened? So when is, when, when is it from, from now until...
[43:19.240 --> 43:24.180]  From now until next August 1st. Yeah. So for one year, one full year. Yeah,
[43:24.240 --> 43:27.980]  because that's what your average was, right? What? Yeah, it's a year. It's a year, yes.
[43:28.640 --> 43:32.060]  This is what it says. According to recent survey data obtained by the council,
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.360]  Americans purchase 350 million pounds of hot dogs at retail stores. That's 9 billion hot dogs. But
[43:37.360 --> 43:41.960]  the actual number of hot dogs consumed by Americans is much larger. It's difficult to
[43:41.960 --> 43:47.520]  calculate the number of hot dogs Americans eat at sporting events, picnics and carnivals, but
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.400]  they estimate Americans consume 20 billion dogs a year. That works out to about 70 hot dogs per
[43:53.400 --> 44:00.540]  person per year. Hot dogs are served in 95% of homes in the United States. 15% of hot dogs are
[44:00.540 --> 44:06.940]  purchased from street vendors and 9% are purchased at ballparks. Do you think if, if humanity took
[44:06.940 --> 44:13.680]  all the dogs that had ever been produced or eaten and put them in orbit, would we be able to see it
[44:13.680 --> 44:19.480]  like a moon? Would it be big enough? Yes. You could make a moon dog, a moon dog. That's a,
[44:19.480 --> 44:26.200]  that's a lot of dogs. I mean, it's 20 billion a year and that's in America. I don't even think
[44:26.200 --> 44:31.280]  we're the number one nation. What country eats the most hot dogs? I know the answer. I just want to
[44:31.280 --> 44:35.680]  make sure I'm right. Eats the how much? Cause I don't think, I don't think you're going to guess
[44:35.680 --> 44:42.560]  it. I don't think you're going to guess it. Uh, I'd say at least 5,000 dogs. Moon weight.
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.980]  Wait, how many, wait, how many people? You think that the moon, you think the moon is probably
[44:48.980 --> 44:56.060]  less than 5,000 pounds? Well, how much does a dog weigh? Hot dog. It's less than a pound, right?
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.240]  Half a pound. What do you mean right? Why are you saying right? Like you think it's more than a
[45:01.240 --> 45:06.340]  pound. Do you think a hot dog is more than a pound? Smokies can be pretty heavy. Do they count? What
[45:06.340 --> 45:13.440]  we're, are we including Smokies? How much is a dog? How does it weigh? A thousand million,
[45:13.640 --> 45:23.880]  billion, trillion, quadrillion. The moon weighs... Okay. You, Eric, can someone look up how much
[45:23.880 --> 45:29.760]  a dog weighs? You're saying hot dog. Yes. Yeah. I'm making sure that you mean hot dog. Yeah.
[45:30.420 --> 45:35.120]  Okay. Tell me what, how much it weighs and then don't say how much a moon, the moon weighs.
[45:35.120 --> 45:41.600]  Okay. Are you, are you ready? Uh, give me the number of the weight of a hot dog and I'll tell
[45:41.600 --> 45:50.520]  you moon. Okay. A standard hot dog weighs 1.6 ounces. What? I need that in how many? Don't
[45:50.520 --> 45:56.400]  look at me. You asked me for this. Okay. How many ounces? How many ounces in a pound?
[45:57.480 --> 46:05.520]  Ounces in a pound? There are 40 hot dogs in five pounds. 40 hot dogs. Okay. No, it's fine. That,
[46:05.780 --> 46:10.400]  well, listen, he gets my brain. Uh, 40 hot dogs, five pounds. I'm giving him round numbers to play
[46:10.400 --> 46:17.060]  with. Uh, so it's like 12 and a half hot dogs a pound. Is that right? Oh man. Okay. 40 hot dogs,
[46:17.280 --> 46:24.920]  five pounds. We're a long way off the moon. Well, his first, his initial guess was 5,000. I'm
[46:24.920 --> 46:30.380]  gonna, I'm gonna say. So we've been way off. I'm going to say a number. You tell me over under.
[46:31.660 --> 46:39.460]  Okay. 5,000. Four. Oh, wait. I had to, I then have to do the math. Fuck. So 40.
[46:41.040 --> 46:43.160]  How much does 4 million hot dogs weigh?
[46:47.280 --> 46:56.580]  And pounds. So 40, 40 is five. 40 is five pounds. What? This is what Chicago should have sang about.
[47:01.280 --> 47:05.480]  This show is good. This is a good show. I've got moon stats. I've got the moon weight here.
[47:05.700 --> 47:09.060]  Yeah. Don't tell me. Don't tell me. I'm going to get there. I'm going to get there via dogs.
[47:09.560 --> 47:13.260]  You're not going to get anywhere near it with dogs. How many, no. How many times
[47:13.260 --> 47:16.960]  does 40, how many times does five go into a million?
[47:22.360 --> 47:24.140]  Wait, how many times.
[47:26.240 --> 47:31.260]  You want to do a million divided by four? In a million. Yeah, let him get there. Let him get
[47:31.260 --> 47:37.720]  there, Gavin. Five going to a million. Uh, did you guys, while he's doing that, did you guys know
[47:37.720 --> 47:44.560]  that Americans consume an average of 818 hot dogs per second? That's crazy. So think about all
[47:44.560 --> 47:48.720]  the time you wanted to wipe out. In 90 minutes that you wanted to wipe out, that's so many dogs,
[47:48.860 --> 47:54.260]  dude. I would have wiped out a lot of dogs. That's true. Yeah. And you can figure out how many while
[47:54.260 --> 47:59.300]  Andrew figures out how many hot dogs. So if you have 200,500 bills, you have a million. I can do
[47:59.300 --> 48:09.800]  that. Hold on. 818. Wait, what did you say, Andrew? If you have $200,000 in $5 bills.
[48:13.060 --> 48:22.500]  Let me explain. If you have $200,000 in $5 bills, you have a million dollars. So it's 200 million,
[48:22.940 --> 48:28.840]  or no, it's 200,000 units. So 200,000 units of hot dogs.
[48:30.580 --> 48:42.800]  Is a million. Wait, I need a sheet from me. I need some paper. I'm getting lost in the numbers.
[48:43.180 --> 48:48.480]  I want this to be in the next science fiction movie. Imagine the background of Interstellar
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.920]  on one of the chalkboards is just the ramblings of this mentalist. Just dog math in the background.
[48:53.920 --> 49:00.140]  So 40 dogs is five. Uh-huh. 40 dogs is five. Yeah. I said a million dogs. I was trying to
[49:00.140 --> 49:07.240]  figure out how much a million dogs weighs. So a million dogs at five, it'd be 200,000
[49:07.240 --> 49:12.500]  to get to a million. So 200,000. Oh, no, wait, that doesn't. Wait.
[49:13.900 --> 49:18.120]  You're saying you want to do 40 times 200,000? I don't know what I want to do, Gavin.
[49:18.120 --> 49:25.760]  So the moon weighs... I'm going to take my headphones off. How close are you to an answer?
[49:26.540 --> 49:30.860]  Nowhere close. Nowhere close. But I'm going to need more time than the show allows.
[49:31.160 --> 49:34.040]  I would have wiped out approximately two million hot dogs.
[49:34.280 --> 49:41.200]  Wow. I don't feel comfortable doing that. And so I rescind the entirety of the intent of my
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.660]  statement. I don't want to eliminate two million hot dogs from the population. That seems cruel.
[49:47.300 --> 49:50.960]  I'm ordering hot dogs for lunch now because of this conversation. You better write it down.
[49:51.120 --> 49:56.860]  Sounds good. Make sure to take a note of it. I will. My next hot dog's probably in Detroit
[49:56.860 --> 50:03.680]  at a baseball game. Oh, yeah. I have a chili dog for lunch. You're having a chili dog for lunch?
[50:03.700 --> 50:06.660]  That's a dangerous thing. I mean, we've been talking about... how many dogs did you
[50:06.660 --> 50:11.400]  demolish during your desk dog era? Oh, I only made desk dogs once.
[50:15.720 --> 50:20.100]  Oh, man. Well, we got a lot of content out of the one time you made hot dogs.
[50:20.400 --> 50:26.060]  I made desk dogs once and it occurred... it was simultaneous with Trump upsetting the election.
[50:26.260 --> 50:30.820]  It was a wild day. It was a wild night. That was all the same day.
[50:31.680 --> 50:36.700]  Me running around my room trying to throw pancake mix around because I think the fire department's
[50:36.700 --> 50:46.840]  coming. I guess I made... no, I did it twice because I did closet dogs once as well.
[50:47.180 --> 50:50.500]  So what figure did you come to? Yeah, so where'd you land?
[50:50.760 --> 50:56.270]  For the... the figure I landed is where I'm getting hot dogs from. Let's say...
[50:59.220 --> 51:03.620]  the problem is if I just say the weight, do you know the number of dogs?
[51:04.180 --> 51:05.560]  Is that math that you can do?
[51:07.800 --> 51:12.960]  No, this is your thing. I mean, a hot dog is 1.2 ounces, right? Isn't that what Eric said?
[51:13.160 --> 51:16.820]  I think... I think it was 1.6. Oh, 40 dogs is 5 pounds.
[51:17.760 --> 51:20.860]  It's true. 1.6 ounces. So 80 dogs is 10 pounds.
[51:21.540 --> 51:23.660]  80 dogs is 10 pounds. And 120 is 15.
[51:24.320 --> 51:26.320]  Uh-huh. We're gonna get there. 160.
[51:26.720 --> 51:30.760]  We're gonna add 40s until we get to how much the moon weighs.
[51:30.760 --> 51:31.420]  Hahaha!
[51:34.180 --> 51:37.960]  This is... we're gonna table this. This is gonna be a supplemental in itself
[51:37.960 --> 51:40.800]  so we don't have to subject people to...
[51:40.800 --> 51:43.860]  I like the idea of there being like a times tables, but for dog weight.
[51:44.200 --> 51:47.460]  I need one of those things with the beads that go back and forth.
[51:47.560 --> 51:49.500]  An abacus. Yeah, one of those.
[51:50.860 --> 51:55.360]  How embarrassing was it, Gavin? I got to call you a doofus because you said something dumb.
[51:56.240 --> 51:59.080]  That must have been tough. I mean, I said at the time it was... it was shocking. It was
[51:59.940 --> 52:02.540]  the most venomous doofus I've ever received in my life.
[52:02.720 --> 52:05.940]  You know why I was so quick on the draw? I didn't share this with you.
[52:06.500 --> 52:08.880]  I had the same thought about 15 minutes earlier.
[52:09.200 --> 52:13.140]  And I went through the exercise in my head. That's why I was quick on the draw.
[52:13.400 --> 52:16.520]  Because I had that thought and then I realized, oh, it's face down.
[52:16.720 --> 52:21.200]  So then when you came at me with it, I was like, oh no, I'm ready. I'm ready for this.
[52:21.840 --> 52:25.660]  Yeah, I didn't take into account that the column header was taking up the first slot.
[52:28.520 --> 52:34.100]  I've been loving the Olympics. I got real nervous because I took the under on Kazakhstan
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.580]  and it's two and they need two to hit the over. And they got one on the first evening
[52:40.580 --> 52:45.700]  of the Olympics. Wow. They haven't done anything since. I've been checking every day
[52:45.700 --> 52:48.980]  anxiously, making sure that Kazakhstan doesn't get another gold.
[52:49.760 --> 52:55.120]  So I'm I'm confused. Are we vamping while he does math or did we give up?
[52:55.120 --> 52:58.260]  No, no, there's no. I think he gave up on it.
[52:58.640 --> 53:00.960]  Are we ever going to find out how much the moon weighs then?
[53:01.340 --> 53:06.320]  The moon weighs 74 million, million, million tons or in pounds.
[53:06.540 --> 53:09.960]  It's a one followed by 23 zeros.
[53:10.260 --> 53:15.340]  Holy God. So Andrew was close when he said 1.6 ounces.
[53:16.040 --> 53:17.300]  5,000 hot dogs.
[53:17.300 --> 53:21.220]  So I assume if you were able to stick all the dogs ever consumed by humans
[53:21.220 --> 53:25.280]  in a big ball by the moon, it would appear very tiny.
[53:25.780 --> 53:28.780]  Maybe the size of like a star through a telescope.
[53:30.000 --> 53:30.780]  You think?
[53:33.560 --> 53:39.980]  Let me say 20 billion hot dogs a year just in the U.S.
[53:40.160 --> 53:41.260]  That's the whole world.
[53:42.160 --> 53:43.700]  You took your headphones off?
[53:44.020 --> 53:45.020]  I didn't want to have the moon weighed.
[53:45.320 --> 53:45.400]  Spoiler.
[53:45.420 --> 53:46.400]  Oh, my God.
[53:47.600 --> 53:50.680]  Some people want to keep that. Should we put a spoiler warning at the beginning of the episode
[53:51.400 --> 53:51.880]  Spoilers.
[53:52.020 --> 53:53.500]  Spoil the weight of the moon.
[53:53.800 --> 53:57.360]  We will tell you how big the moon is in this episode.
[53:59.560 --> 54:01.240]  Next episode. I'm going to listen.
[54:01.500 --> 54:03.740]  I'm going to put that at the front in the description.
[54:04.820 --> 54:05.300]  Warning.
[54:08.240 --> 54:08.720]  Spoilers.
[54:09.040 --> 54:10.140]  I'm going to do some math.
[54:12.260 --> 54:16.380]  And next episode, I'm going to throw a number and you guys can tell me over or under that number.
[54:16.680 --> 54:17.080]  All right.
[54:17.580 --> 54:18.800]  And we'll narrow it in.
[54:18.800 --> 54:21.760]  Well, now can I can I make my prediction now?
[54:22.280 --> 54:22.540]  Yeah.
[54:23.000 --> 54:23.520]  Under.
[54:24.060 --> 54:26.980]  I'm going to go really high.
[54:27.140 --> 54:28.280]  So I still predict under.
[54:28.460 --> 54:31.500]  I don't understand the number Gavin said.
[54:32.940 --> 54:34.900]  Yeah, it didn't sound like math anymore.
[54:35.660 --> 54:37.120]  I play clicker games.
[54:37.200 --> 54:38.340]  OK, I know some big numbers.
[54:39.460 --> 54:41.420]  You get big real fast in those clicker games.
[54:42.460 --> 54:44.480]  Start getting symbols you don't even know.
[54:46.500 --> 54:47.160]  What's a UT?
[54:47.380 --> 54:48.320]  I have no fucking idea.
[54:48.320 --> 54:49.420]  That's when I stop.
[54:49.720 --> 54:53.300]  When I get to the UT in a clicker game, I stop because I just can't comprehend
[54:53.820 --> 54:54.960]  what I'm looking at.
[54:56.680 --> 54:56.920]  I don't know.
[54:57.240 --> 54:57.740]  Millions of a billion.
[54:58.140 --> 55:00.120]  You know, in a clicker, you've never played a clicker?
[55:00.640 --> 55:00.800]  No.
[55:01.800 --> 55:02.260]  What are you on about?
[55:03.040 --> 55:05.220]  Am I the only one here that's played clicker games?
[55:05.720 --> 55:06.980]  I mean, I've played the last of us.
[55:07.140 --> 55:08.400]  Like like cookie clicker.
[55:08.680 --> 55:09.920]  Yeah, like cookie clicker.
[55:09.960 --> 55:10.680]  That's an example.
[55:11.200 --> 55:11.900]  Cookie clicker.
[55:12.440 --> 55:19.120]  Yeah, it's like Gavin says it so different.
[55:20.040 --> 55:23.780]  Everyone's just letting me be confused for like 30 straight seconds here.
[55:23.800 --> 55:24.540]  No one said anything.
[55:24.880 --> 55:29.480]  He said cookie clicker like he'd never heard those words together in his life.
[55:29.740 --> 55:30.260]  I haven't.
[55:32.560 --> 55:34.560]  Am I the idiot after all this?
[55:34.660 --> 55:35.600]  I'm the moron.
[55:35.740 --> 55:36.180]  No, no, no.
[55:36.200 --> 55:36.860]  I don't think you are.
[55:37.080 --> 55:39.480]  Oh, I just assumed that one of you would have played.
[55:39.820 --> 55:40.800]  It's an idle game.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.580]  You'd probably hate it.
[55:42.700 --> 55:46.560]  You don't strike me as an idle game guy where you're just trying to make the numbers get bigger
[55:46.560 --> 55:48.340]  and the game is constantly running.
[55:48.460 --> 55:52.860]  And then you pop into it for five minutes and you buy upgrades and you make the numbers go larger.
[55:53.240 --> 55:54.140]  So what's UT?
[55:54.820 --> 55:55.780]  I don't know.
[55:56.160 --> 55:57.640]  I'd said the currency number.
[55:58.540 --> 56:00.760]  Like it'll go from millions to billions to trillions.
[56:00.940 --> 56:03.460]  And then eventually you just because the numbers just keep going up.
[56:03.640 --> 56:06.340]  You hit currency levels that I have no clue.
[56:06.900 --> 56:10.000]  I think UT is point seven moons.
[56:11.620 --> 56:13.860]  Oh, I think it's yeah.
[56:13.880 --> 56:14.360]  Over under.
[56:15.400 --> 56:17.460]  That's that's a that's an under for me.
[56:17.840 --> 56:19.960]  I'm excited to hear your moon guess next week, though.
[56:20.080 --> 56:21.640]  I think that's going to be we should remember.
[56:21.900 --> 56:22.700]  I need to sit.
[56:23.040 --> 56:23.880]  Lab work.
[56:24.300 --> 56:25.400]  Oh, I'm I'm noting it.
[56:25.440 --> 56:28.140]  I put I'm putting it in caps.
[56:28.240 --> 56:28.700]  Moon guess.
[56:29.700 --> 56:31.500]  Hopefully you remember what moon guess means.
[56:31.620 --> 56:32.460]  I got the note, though.
[56:33.000 --> 56:34.520]  I got to put my moon shoes on.
[56:34.580 --> 56:35.960]  I got to get into the mind of a moon.
[56:36.100 --> 56:37.700]  I got to really try to feel the way.
[56:39.680 --> 56:40.960]  I read it.
[56:41.100 --> 56:46.500]  I read a great comment this week about how someone said they wanted to subscribe to our
[56:46.500 --> 56:49.460]  Patreon, but make sure that Eric doesn't get his cut.
[56:51.780 --> 56:57.160]  I feel like we should definitely do a tier on Patreon that is twenty five dollars discounted
[56:57.160 --> 56:57.740]  to twenty.
[56:58.800 --> 57:00.580]  For exactly that purpose.
[57:01.280 --> 57:02.340]  Doesn't go to Eric.
[57:02.620 --> 57:04.880]  We just make sure Eric never gets that cut.
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.540]  It's because I made fun of that guy that said like he said that Andrew sounds like he just
[57:09.540 --> 57:12.440]  made a post as it just made his Andrew sound like Bernie Burns.
[57:12.580 --> 57:14.520]  And it's like, you're fucking crazy.
[57:14.900 --> 57:16.060]  You're a crazy.
[57:16.200 --> 57:17.120]  Get your ears checked.
[57:17.500 --> 57:21.580]  It's a community of people who need to get their ears and eyes checked now.
[57:22.040 --> 57:23.440]  Like, what is happening?
[57:23.540 --> 57:24.800]  Their senses are dulled.
[57:24.940 --> 57:26.180]  They need to figure something out.
[57:26.300 --> 57:26.860]  It's not working.
[57:27.100 --> 57:29.400]  Big words coming from a guy that didn't like twisters.
[57:30.140 --> 57:30.800]  Big words.
[57:31.940 --> 57:34.860]  Sounds like you need to get your ears and eyes checked based on what they're saying.
[57:34.880 --> 57:35.840]  Great movie.
[57:36.140 --> 57:37.440]  Yeah, that's what needs to happen.
[57:37.560 --> 57:39.360]  How did twisters sound to you?
[57:41.400 --> 57:43.200]  It's it sounded like Nick.
[57:43.520 --> 57:43.960]  What?
[57:45.300 --> 57:46.260]  That's not true.
[57:47.420 --> 57:47.860]  No.
[57:49.840 --> 57:50.620]  I got confused.
[57:50.680 --> 57:53.900]  I closed my eyes and I thought Nick was talking to me and it was just twisters.
[57:55.720 --> 57:58.220]  I've often get Nick and a tornado confused.
[57:59.340 --> 58:00.940]  I can never if I'm hearing him.
[58:01.180 --> 58:03.440]  I why I don't listen to old episodes because I can't tell.
[58:03.440 --> 58:05.300]  Is that Nick or is it the fucking tornado again?
[58:06.120 --> 58:07.780]  They did try in that movie.
[58:07.840 --> 58:08.720]  They did try to implement.
[58:08.820 --> 58:09.940]  This is another reason I didn't like the movie.
[58:10.100 --> 58:12.380]  They tried to implement a new sound to the twisters.
[58:12.460 --> 58:17.260]  That was like, like if something was spinning, but it's all that's not like.
[58:18.160 --> 58:19.200]  It's all spit.
[58:19.640 --> 58:20.040]  What?
[58:20.520 --> 58:21.940]  What bit is making that noise?
[58:22.300 --> 58:22.760]  It's not like a revolution coming back.
[58:22.760 --> 58:23.820]  It's not like a fan.
[58:23.980 --> 58:24.680]  It's not like a.
[58:25.800 --> 58:28.620]  How would there be one part of it that's coming around?
[58:29.060 --> 58:31.360]  Is that like the sound of a house that's trapped inside it?
[58:31.360 --> 58:31.900]  What was that?
[58:33.100 --> 58:36.360]  That's the yeah, that's the house from Wizard of Oz spinning around.
[58:36.620 --> 58:43.040]  I think historically, the twister just sounds like a constant terrifying whistle of air and wind.
[58:44.960 --> 58:46.840]  I just we already.
[58:47.340 --> 58:49.620]  I need to watch it again and see if I was too harsh.
[58:50.180 --> 58:54.000]  The idea that a guy would spend five years in the army and walk away with billions of
[58:54.000 --> 58:59.920]  dollars of missile satellite technology while he was in the army was the size of a block,
[58:59.920 --> 59:05.580]  but they got it down to the size of an LED panel and then the military let him take it.
[59:05.660 --> 59:09.060]  Once again, just point out, I was in the army also for five years.
[59:09.180 --> 59:14.540]  I got a blanket and a pair of boots and my dog tags when I left and I had to fight for the blanket.
[59:14.940 --> 59:18.140]  You know, it's like I just it boggles the mind.
[59:18.240 --> 59:21.180]  And then the idea that it's funded by an evil developer
[59:21.180 --> 59:25.800]  who just wants to buy up property cheaply after people go through a tragedy.
[59:25.800 --> 59:30.780]  They need to hire a company with billions of dollars of technology to figure out
[59:30.780 --> 59:36.620]  the place that used to be a house is going to be for sale next week by hire 30 real estate
[59:36.620 --> 59:43.220]  agents and let them loose on those Oklahoma towns and save 60 billion dollars in R&D investment.
[59:43.300 --> 59:45.980]  It's so ludicrous. I'm sorry. Here we go. Here we go again.
[59:46.240 --> 59:50.280]  I'm sorry. The spinning cow in the wind movie wasn't more realistic for you.
[59:50.380 --> 59:51.240]  I apologize.
[59:51.340 --> 59:52.820]  I wish that there was a spinning cow.
[59:53.040 --> 59:55.000]  I wish to God there was a spinning cow.
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.720]  Andrew, you're talking about stuff that didn't happen in the movie.
[59:58.080 --> 59:59.820]  Yeah, I would. Is there a reference?
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.680]  You spin and you spin a cow. Maybe I'll see it again.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:03.980]  Yep. I wish.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:09.180]  I mean, we're not saying like the first movie was sensible. It was a goofy movie.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:14.360]  They at some point they drive drive through a house that blew in the road and like go through
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:19.840]  it's a stupid movie. I think my main problem with this one is that it took itself really seriously.
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.060]  Yeah, there's no memorable action sequences. Yeah, there's no memorable action sequences
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.040]  like nothing. Nothing is happening.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:30.380]  Well, I hear it's great and you should see it for yourself and make your own opinions.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.400]  I also think people should see it. I think people, irrespective of our dumb movie thing,
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.640]  people should see every movie in the theater because if they don't,
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.980]  there won't be any more movies in theaters and going to the movies is fun.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.140]  So go see. Go see Twisters 30 fucking times. It doesn't matter. I'm not going to win this
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.320]  stupid competition anyway, so I don't give a fuck what movie you see. I just see it a lot
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.000]  so that there's still movies, even if they're bad.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.080]  I think you can skip Twisters. I'm going to watch it again on a plane
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.320]  and see if maybe I was too harsh. I just remember I was a little bit disappointed with it.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.300]  Big time plane movie. Yeah, big time plane movie.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.960]  I would say it's a plane movie. I would watch it again on a plane, probably.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.740]  I think that what's his name? Glenn Powell. Is that his name?
[01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.500]  Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:16.020]  Like he he's charming enough in his role. I feel like the first 10 minutes is a little wonky,
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.440]  but after that, like he's like they settle into that character. He's I mean, he's entertaining
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.880]  enough to watch, I think, but on a plane. Could have used a dog.
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.840]  Oh, dude, that dude and a dog for fucking get about it. That's another. I'm telling you,
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:34.860]  we talked about it already. That's a $50 million dog. That's a $50 million dog.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:38.280]  You put a fucking bandana around it. You got a $60 million dog.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:44.520]  You figure out a way to put goggles on that dog. You got a $65 million dog.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.500]  Yep. You figure out a way to have that dog go
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:52.540]  into the tornado and come out alive, saving something, piece of equipment,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.300]  human life, whatever. $120 million dog. Yep.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.820]  Well, thanks for listening to this episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.560]  Next week, Andrew's going to let us know how many hot dogs is the moon.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.360]  You can go to Regulatrion.com and subscribe to the Patreon. You can check out our gaming
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.320]  channel. You can watch us stream Fridays at 4 p.m. A lot's going on. Very exciting stuff.
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.720]  Yeah, check out our Olympics coverage, as Andrew called it. It was probably
[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.520]  the most culturally insensitive piece of content we've made today.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.280]  I gotta say, I think somebody else said this and I fully agree. It's the most Andrew I've
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:37.180]  ever seen Andrew be. And that is a tremendous compliment. You were so unbelievably entertaining
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:42.600]  in that piece of content we made. I take the Olympics seriously.
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:50.800]  Clearly. Clearly. You definitely take vibes seriously and that definitely shines
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.940]  and shows through in the video. I keep saying video. I guess it's a video.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.200]  Don't drink the strawberry drink. Don't drink the... You had some?
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.140]  I just had a little taste. You're a maniac. You can't. Was it good? No.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.940]  Why? What did it taste like? Of course it wasn't good. No, I'm not joking. You're a fucking animal,
[01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:23.600]  Nick. I definitely wouldn't have done that. It's very sweet, but like stale. Stale sweet.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.520]  I just had the tiniest little taste because I'm going to go pour this out.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:31.200]  Why did you taste it? Because you guys kept telling me to taste it.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:35.940]  Yeah, it's true. We all did that. Yeah, we all did that. You're right. You're right.
[01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:41.640]  An entire video ago? Yeah, it was a week ago for everyone else. For us, it was about an hour.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.240]  You don't get to attack me when you call it a video.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.640]  Well, thanks for watching this video. We'll see you guys next time. Bye.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.560]  It's on YouTube. It's got video. He's right.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.620]  I feel like I have a brain virus.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:07.620]  We also feel like you have a brain virus. Yeah. Check in and see how its vibes are.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:17.560]  See if it knows how many hot dogs the moon weighs. I need more fingers. How is it possible to eat?
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.280]  I love hot dogs. I don't think I could eat 70 hot dogs in a year. No, no. It's insanity.
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.680]  That's got to be bullshit, right? They're juicing the figures. They're plumping up those figures.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.380]  I mean, that's only like slightly more than one a week. They're sizzling the stats.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:35.360]  Plump and juicy like a hot dog. It's like one every six days or so, probably.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:40.220]  Can you make a healthy dog? Can you make like a dog that's just a cut of meat?
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.460]  What? What? What are you talking about? Well, like they're terrible. They're awful for you,
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.700]  right? Because they're just like mulched up, awful and shit. Yeah, but let's not talk about
[01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.440]  that. We don't want to talk about what's in them. We just want to talk about how they taste and how
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.020]  they make us feel. Yeah. And how many is the moon? So it's a lot of really good stuff. All right,
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:07.120]  guys. We'll talk to you later. Bye. Bye. Oh, no. Oh, no. What?
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:14.880]  One of our editors texted me that the FIFA video was done and I replied,
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:20.760]  Thank you, Gavin. No, no, no. It's a hit, man. So feel free to juice what I meant to write in voice.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:31.300]  Feel free to juice. Hey, we'll we'll we'll we'll juice you later.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.220]  See you next juice. Juice out.
