[00:00.760 --> 00:03.400]  This episode is brought to you by State Farm.
[00:03.840 --> 00:07.040]  Checking off the boxes on your to-do list is a great feeling.
[00:07.520 --> 00:09.280]  And when it comes to checking off coverage,
[00:09.500 --> 00:12.700]  a State Farm agent can help you choose an option that's right for you.
[00:12.900 --> 00:17.160]  Whether you prefer talking in person, on the phone, or using the award-winning app,
[00:17.400 --> 00:20.880]  it's nice knowing you have help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[00:21.240 --> 00:23.160]  Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.
[00:25.900 --> 00:29.980]  Hello and welcome to another piece of supplemental content.
[00:30.220 --> 00:33.700]  I got a new show, a new idea for you guys.
[00:33.840 --> 00:37.540]  We're going to play a new game. I'm excited to see how this goes.
[00:37.980 --> 00:41.680]  This could be a disaster. This could be great. We'll find out.
[00:41.740 --> 00:45.200]  There's probably going to be adjustments as we do these, if we even do more of them.
[00:45.400 --> 00:47.280]  But I think it has a chance to be a lot of fun.
[00:47.720 --> 00:50.380]  We are playing a thing I'm calling, Who Are You?
[00:51.140 --> 00:51.580]  Oh!
[00:52.200 --> 00:55.940]  How are you guys feeling about this? You have no idea. I haven't explained anything.
[00:56.060 --> 00:59.240]  I don't feel anything. Hi, it's me, Eric. I'm here with Jeff and Nick.
[00:59.360 --> 01:01.460]  And Andrew is hosting Who Are You?
[01:02.440 --> 01:08.380]  Who Are You? So, yesterday, I sent out a series of questions to all of you guys
[01:08.380 --> 01:12.820]  that you would have opinions on. And you sent me answers. And I compiled them.
[01:13.540 --> 01:16.140]  So how this game works is there are two players.
[01:16.620 --> 01:19.220]  And the players in this episode are going to be Eric and Jeff.
[01:19.660 --> 01:20.640]  You are the players.
[01:21.240 --> 01:24.780]  Now, there's going to be a third role that you're going to play, Nick,
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.300]  called the interviewer.
[01:26.600 --> 01:29.740]  And this is something that the audience can kind of play along as they listen.
[01:30.500 --> 01:35.780]  So the goal of the game is, I am going to read one of the things I asked.
[01:35.800 --> 01:38.220]  So one of the things was, what is a movie you love?
[01:38.560 --> 01:40.700]  I will read, what is a movie you love?
[01:40.840 --> 01:44.840]  And then I will give an answer that was submitted, that somebody picked.
[01:45.240 --> 01:47.700]  And the idea was, these are things you don't necessarily associate
[01:47.700 --> 01:49.120]  or think the other guys know about you.
[01:49.220 --> 01:54.180]  I will say it, and which, once I finish, Eric and Jeff,
[01:54.580 --> 01:59.340]  you will immediately begin trying to convince Nick that this is an opinion you have.
[01:59.580 --> 02:00.960]  Now, maybe it is an opinion you have.
[02:01.220 --> 02:04.560]  But Nick, you need to determine if it is so much of an opinion they have
[02:04.560 --> 02:07.580]  that they would write it as their answer to this question.
[02:08.280 --> 02:10.480]  Now, you have the ability as the interviewer, Nick,
[02:10.500 --> 02:13.280]  to ask five questions throughout this process.
[02:14.220 --> 02:16.220]  Then you will have to make a decision.
[02:16.840 --> 02:18.560]  Is this Eric's answer?
[02:18.560 --> 02:19.500]  Is he being truthful?
[02:20.040 --> 02:21.160]  Is it Jeff's answer?
[02:22.140 --> 02:23.980]  Or is it Gavin or Ice?
[02:24.120 --> 02:25.020]  Is it neither of them?
[02:25.100 --> 02:26.020]  They're both pretending.
[02:27.120 --> 02:29.200]  It might not even be one of ours.
[02:29.540 --> 02:30.100]  This is great.
[02:30.580 --> 02:33.100]  And we're going to keep track of all the points.
[02:33.840 --> 02:35.240]  Everyone's going to cycle through.
[02:35.340 --> 02:38.840]  And at the end of everyone getting a chance to be the interviewer with all the accommodations,
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.700]  we will reveal the final score.
[02:40.780 --> 02:42.680]  We'll do episode by episode scoring as well.
[02:42.900 --> 02:47.180]  But this isn't over until everyone's gone through the maximum interview process.
[02:47.180 --> 02:48.400]  Keep track of that.
[02:48.420 --> 02:49.520]  Is there anything I'm missing?
[02:49.840 --> 02:51.160]  You ask questions.
[02:51.560 --> 02:52.760]  You guys have any questions?
[02:53.220 --> 02:55.960]  So Nick is the only person scoring today.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.280]  You can get...
[02:57.280 --> 02:58.040]  OK, thank you.
[02:58.140 --> 02:58.940]  That is what I was going to explain.
[02:59.320 --> 03:00.380]  If Nick...
[03:00.380 --> 03:00.820]  This game rules.
[03:02.000 --> 03:02.960]  If Nick...
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.700]  Let's say, Jeff, it's not yours, but you convince Nick that it is.
[03:07.040 --> 03:09.540]  You get a point if he incorrectly picks you.
[03:09.840 --> 03:10.120]  OK.
[03:11.180 --> 03:15.020]  Nick, if you pick correctly, you get a point.
[03:15.560 --> 03:21.640]  And if you're both truthful, if you get truth on the person, you both get points.
[03:21.880 --> 03:22.260]  Got it.
[03:22.320 --> 03:29.340]  So if I say my favorite food is pizza and then Nick picks me for pizza, we both get a point.
[03:29.480 --> 03:30.420]  You both get a point.
[03:30.560 --> 03:30.680]  Yeah.
[03:30.780 --> 03:30.880]  OK.
[03:31.100 --> 03:35.700]  And Nick, you can also... there will be, as I said, responses that are not either Jeff
[03:35.700 --> 03:37.580]  or Eric or whoever the players are.
[03:37.700 --> 03:38.960]  And you would have to pick a third one.
[03:38.980 --> 03:41.720]  In that case, you would just get a point by yourself.
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.780]  So that would increase your own score.
[03:44.260 --> 03:44.820]  We'll see.
[03:44.940 --> 03:48.980]  I think it'll be fun by the end of this to see, like, who gets the most as the interviewer.
[03:49.100 --> 03:51.800]  We'll balance it out so the points make sense throughout these episodes.
[03:52.500 --> 03:54.220]  Any questions before we begin?
[03:54.680 --> 03:55.880]  You said five questions.
[03:55.940 --> 03:57.720]  Is that of each of them or all together?
[03:57.860 --> 03:58.340]  All together.
[03:58.340 --> 03:59.900]  You get five questions.
[04:00.040 --> 04:01.780]  So you have to be... and you have to pick who you're asking.
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.640]  So he could choose to not... like, if he thinks he knows right off the bat, he doesn't have
[04:06.640 --> 04:07.180]  to ask a question.
[04:07.260 --> 04:09.660]  He could bank and ask three questions on the same one.
[04:10.100 --> 04:10.460]  Exactly.
[04:10.820 --> 04:11.020]  OK.
[04:11.200 --> 04:12.060]  Well, it's every round.
[04:12.200 --> 04:12.460]  Sorry.
[04:12.460 --> 04:13.940]  So I'll do one.
[04:14.080 --> 04:14.480]  He'll get five.
[04:14.620 --> 04:14.660]  OK.
[04:14.720 --> 04:17.580]  So remember when you asked that question and then he gave you an answer?
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.780]  The answer is actually the opposite of what he said.
[04:19.840 --> 04:20.000]  Yeah.
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.240]  Sorry, I was compiling something and then I realized I misheard what you said.
[04:25.740 --> 04:27.520]  Welcome to Regulation Podcast.
[04:27.820 --> 04:30.400]  You almost got the answer you were looking for the first time.
[04:30.780 --> 04:31.080]  Nearly.
[04:31.520 --> 04:33.840]  Listen, but it was immediately correct and it wasn't a fight.
[04:33.880 --> 04:34.480]  That was on me.
[04:34.520 --> 04:35.220]  I acknowledge that.
[04:35.340 --> 04:36.040]  No, totally fine.
[04:36.100 --> 04:36.500]  Totally fine.
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.360]  We're ready to begin the game.
[04:40.000 --> 04:40.500]  Who are you?
[04:40.980 --> 04:41.200]  Yep.
[04:41.220 --> 04:41.660]  I'm nervous.
[04:41.740 --> 04:42.160]  Let's do it.
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.240]  A movie I love is The Mummy.
[04:47.060 --> 04:48.420]  Eric and Jeff, begin.
[04:49.120 --> 04:50.240]  Immediately, that's me.
[04:51.660 --> 04:53.520]  Do I just let Eric talk and then I go?
[04:53.700 --> 04:54.920]  No, you can interject as much as you want.
[04:55.080 --> 04:59.360]  Hey, Nick, listen to how Jeff didn't even chime in.
[04:59.960 --> 05:01.600]  Yeah, I just don't know when I'm...
[05:01.600 --> 05:02.900]  I didn't know what the decorum was.
[05:02.920 --> 05:08.200]  It's because if he tells you that The Mummy is his, he's a liar because I wrote The Mummy.
[05:10.260 --> 05:11.360]  I just know decorum.
[05:11.360 --> 05:13.600]  Jeff, you feel free to interject as much as you want.
[05:13.620 --> 05:16.680]  And again, see how he's not jumping in because The Mummy's not his?
[05:17.080 --> 05:20.520]  I don't. I just I have trouble lying to Nick.
[05:20.800 --> 05:22.540]  I have so much respect for him.
[05:23.080 --> 05:24.100]  It feels weird.
[05:25.100 --> 05:26.740]  I gotta be honest, I'm not The Mummy.
[05:28.020 --> 05:28.420]  Okay.
[05:28.900 --> 05:29.240]  All right.
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.460]  Well, that that is helpful.
[05:30.700 --> 05:30.860]  Yeah.
[05:30.980 --> 05:32.200]  Unless I'm trying to trick him.
[05:32.920 --> 05:33.500]  But why would you?
[05:33.680 --> 05:34.780]  You would get a point if I guess.
[05:35.060 --> 05:40.620]  So Nick, we could just save everyone a lot of time.
[05:41.360 --> 05:41.460]  What?
[05:42.500 --> 05:44.500]  Now, here's the thing you need to evaluate, Nick.
[05:44.840 --> 05:45.880]  Is Eric being truthful?
[05:46.740 --> 05:48.540]  Well, yeah, that's yeah, that's...
[05:49.400 --> 05:52.440]  I think I think I know whose answer that is, and it's not Eric's.
[05:52.880 --> 05:55.460]  I don't understand what...
[05:55.460 --> 05:58.360]  I don't get what Jeff's plan is here.
[05:59.340 --> 06:00.680]  Other than he...
[06:00.680 --> 06:02.440]  I have a great plan.
[06:02.580 --> 06:03.600]  Don't worry, I'm on it.
[06:04.440 --> 06:05.140]  Is Jeff...
[06:05.140 --> 06:08.920]  Now you have to consider, Nick, is Jeff being honest or is he trying to prevent Eric from
[06:08.920 --> 06:11.000]  getting a point if he thinks that that's true?
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.780]  It sounds like he's trying to prevent Eric from getting a point and saying,
[06:15.180 --> 06:16.080]  hey, it's the mummy.
[06:16.280 --> 06:18.100]  So that way we both get a point.
[06:18.320 --> 06:23.340]  Or is Jeff actually helping you, Nick, and trying to get you a point by not picking Eric?
[06:23.380 --> 06:24.180]  Yeah, it's not.
[06:24.260 --> 06:25.140]  It's definitely not Eric.
[06:25.280 --> 06:26.380]  And it's not a movie he would have picked.
[06:26.620 --> 06:26.940]  It's not.
[06:27.120 --> 06:28.180]  It's not an Eric style movie.
[06:28.180 --> 06:29.760]  The mummy in Indiana Jones.
[06:29.820 --> 06:35.060]  Like it is an Indiana Jones adventure with Brendan Fraser that scares me.
[06:35.140 --> 06:37.480]  And I think about to this day with the scarabs.
[06:37.740 --> 06:38.420]  Oh, my God.
[06:38.460 --> 06:39.420]  Are you kidding me?
[06:39.660 --> 06:40.040]  Brendan Fraser.
[06:40.040 --> 06:43.640]  Eric watches Speed over and over again.
[06:43.700 --> 06:44.940]  He's not watching the mummy over and over again.
[06:44.940 --> 06:45.820]  I think I watch Speed.
[06:46.160 --> 06:47.160]  So what's going on?
[06:47.160 --> 06:48.280]  Are you Meg?
[06:48.560 --> 06:53.520]  Where you think like somebody saw Speed one time three months ago and you watch Speed every day.
[06:53.840 --> 06:54.520]  Are you insane?
[06:54.620 --> 06:57.180]  You said every time it's on TV, you stop and watch it.
[06:57.760 --> 06:59.540]  Eric, name some of the other cast.
[07:00.080 --> 07:02.220]  Oh, Rachel Weisz is in it.
[07:02.900 --> 07:08.800]  You have a guy who looks like Billy Zane, but he's not.
[07:09.320 --> 07:11.080]  That's not Billy Zane.
[07:11.460 --> 07:12.680]  You think it is.
[07:12.860 --> 07:15.700]  And pretty much almost my whole life, I thought it was.
[07:16.140 --> 07:19.580]  And then when I was probably like 22, I was like people.
[07:19.720 --> 07:21.060]  I'm like, yeah, dude, Billy Zane in the mummy.
[07:21.180 --> 07:22.240]  And they're like, he's not in the mummy.
[07:22.580 --> 07:23.800]  I'm like, yeah, he's the mummy.
[07:23.840 --> 07:25.220]  And they went, no, he's not.
[07:25.580 --> 07:28.820]  And it's a guy that looks just like him.
[07:28.860 --> 07:29.520]  I don't know his name.
[07:30.780 --> 07:31.140]  Okay.
[07:31.280 --> 07:32.500]  Guy who looks like the mummy.
[07:32.960 --> 07:33.540]  I'm kidding.
[07:33.580 --> 07:33.980]  It's me.
[07:34.080 --> 07:34.700]  I like the mummy.
[07:34.980 --> 07:36.300]  This is ridiculous.
[07:36.740 --> 07:37.440]  That's just it.
[07:37.520 --> 07:37.660]  Okay.
[07:37.780 --> 07:39.860]  Well, Jeff, I'm going to direct my questions towards Eric.
[07:39.960 --> 07:40.300]  I'm sorry.
[07:43.540 --> 07:46.420]  Eric, do you remember the name of the little squirrely guy who gets stuck on the other
[07:46.420 --> 07:46.960]  side of the river?
[07:47.460 --> 07:48.080]  Uh, is it?
[07:48.520 --> 07:49.780]  Oh, was that John?
[07:51.260 --> 07:54.380]  See, you don't know because you didn't put the mummy.
[07:54.660 --> 07:56.720]  John's a fucking fake ass name.
[07:57.900 --> 08:00.620]  I will say, Nick, you don't have to ask all five questions.
[08:00.800 --> 08:03.080]  If you make a decision beforehand, you can just lock it in.
[08:03.080 --> 08:04.020]  But you have three more.
[08:04.420 --> 08:05.520]  I'm leaning a certain way.
[08:05.520 --> 08:09.580]  Eric, how many objects had to be obtained before he got his full power?
[08:09.800 --> 08:09.940]  Four.
[08:12.780 --> 08:17.540]  Nick, Nick, I don't want to sack you on what you're doing or whatever.
[08:17.960 --> 08:22.060]  You should ask questions that you know the answer to.
[08:22.880 --> 08:23.140]  Why?
[08:23.320 --> 08:24.360]  I know the answer.
[08:24.720 --> 08:26.920]  That's why I'm hooming to myself.
[08:27.140 --> 08:27.820]  Let me see.
[08:28.520 --> 08:32.480]  I've decided, Andrew, that it was not Eric or Jeff.
[08:32.960 --> 08:33.360]  Okay.
[08:33.360 --> 08:38.580]  I will note that and then I will reveal at the end of the episode.
[08:38.980 --> 08:39.280]  What?
[08:39.460 --> 08:40.580]  Who was right and what was wrong.
[08:40.840 --> 08:42.860]  Oh, I'm feeling very confident in my decision.
[08:43.140 --> 08:43.300]  This is great.
[08:44.180 --> 08:45.560]  I'm so confident.
[08:45.880 --> 08:46.700]  This game's great.
[08:47.520 --> 08:49.260]  This is burger confidence, baby.
[08:49.880 --> 08:51.380]  But I'm not putting a pencil in the line.
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.380]  I'm just going to say, is that good?
[08:54.040 --> 08:55.100]  No, I don't know.
[08:55.220 --> 08:55.780]  Now I'm scared.
[08:56.400 --> 08:57.880]  We're doing this category again.
[08:58.300 --> 08:58.480]  Okay.
[08:58.520 --> 08:58.860]  Another movie.
[08:59.640 --> 09:00.080]  Okay.
[09:00.300 --> 09:01.320]  A movie I love.
[09:01.980 --> 09:03.180]  Mission Impossible 3.
[09:03.360 --> 09:04.680]  It's my movie.
[09:04.920 --> 09:07.140]  My favorite fucking action movie.
[09:07.280 --> 09:08.200]  Mission Impossible 3.
[09:08.320 --> 09:12.400]  The movie I lost my car to Gavin over because I got Kerry Russell wrong.
[09:12.900 --> 09:16.360]  This is the movie that has two or three of the best moments.
[09:16.460 --> 09:19.140]  And no, actually three of the best moments in the history of film.
[09:19.260 --> 09:24.860]  When they break into the Vatican and Ving Rang pops up and he sees Mission Impossible there.
[09:25.060 --> 09:25.500]  Tom Cruise.
[09:25.780 --> 09:26.840]  And he goes, what's up with you?
[09:26.960 --> 09:27.600]  He goes, nothing.
[09:27.780 --> 09:28.220]  What's up with you?
[09:28.340 --> 09:29.080]  He goes, nothing.
[09:29.420 --> 09:32.880]  And then when they go to break into the Burj Khalifa or whatever and they're like,
[09:32.880 --> 09:33.940]  here's the plan. We're going to go in.
[09:34.060 --> 09:36.740]  And then the next scene, it cuts to just hear him on the walkie-talkie going,
[09:36.840 --> 09:38.320]  I'm not going to make the extraction point.
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.400]  I'm not going to make the extraction point.
[09:39.500 --> 09:44.020]  And he jumps out the fucking building and you have no idea what happened inside of that building.
[09:44.220 --> 09:45.720]  We still don't get to know.
[09:45.840 --> 09:47.680]  My mind has been wondering what that...
[09:47.680 --> 09:49.600]  I want a movie just out of what happened in that building.
[09:49.680 --> 09:53.000]  And I bet you it'd be two hours of fucking kick-ass Tom Cruise action.
[09:53.200 --> 09:58.040]  And then at the end, when his wife, the Monaghan lady, when he's...
[09:58.040 --> 09:59.840]  They're like sitting there after the long running scene.
[09:59.860 --> 10:00.760]  And he's like, if you don't...
[10:00.760 --> 10:02.440]  He needs her to fucking shock him to death.
[10:02.440 --> 10:05.120]  And he's like, if you don't kill me, I'm going to die,
[10:05.260 --> 10:07.280]  which is the coolest thing I've ever heard anybody say.
[10:07.360 --> 10:08.220]  That's why I picked that movie.
[10:08.600 --> 10:10.300]  Hey, Nick, let me make this easy for you.
[10:10.400 --> 10:11.560]  That's Andrew's favorite movie.
[10:13.160 --> 10:15.960]  Well, that's an interesting strategy that you've employed there, Eric.
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.260]  I'm letting you know, Jeff simply remembers it because of The Gavin Bet.
[10:22.480 --> 10:23.820]  It's not his favorite movie.
[10:23.900 --> 10:25.940]  It's a movie he remembers, kind of.
[10:26.320 --> 10:27.680]  It is Andrew's favorite movie.
[10:28.140 --> 10:31.340]  So the category is definitely favorite movie, not a movie that you love.
[10:31.340 --> 10:34.820]  No, it was a favorite movie that other people might not associate with you,
[10:34.940 --> 10:35.540]  is what I was told.
[10:36.220 --> 10:36.660]  Okay.
[10:37.140 --> 10:39.980]  Otherwise, I would have picked Harold and Maude or Empire Strikes Back.
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.060]  But I feel like I've said both of those many times in content.
[10:43.300 --> 10:47.480]  I will say, he's talked about Mission Impossible 3 so much in content.
[10:47.860 --> 10:50.600]  Jeff, how could you have such a warm memory
[10:50.600 --> 10:54.380]  and make it your favorite movie when it's something that cost you your car?
[10:54.800 --> 10:57.100]  Because Gavin and I have fake bets all day long.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.600]  And he doesn't have a driver's license, so he can't use it.
[11:00.600 --> 11:01.880]  That's a fair point.
[11:01.940 --> 11:02.520]  Could he repo it?
[11:02.940 --> 11:03.620]  That's not a question.
[11:03.700 --> 11:04.260]  I'm not asking that.
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.720]  Jeff, what was the item that Philip Seymour Hoffman's character was after in the movie?
[11:12.060 --> 11:15.580]  He was after the football or the briefcase or whatever the fuck they call it.
[11:15.620 --> 11:18.080]  You never really know what it is for most of the movie,
[11:18.200 --> 11:21.400]  but I think it was some sort of a nerve agent in a canister.
[11:24.760 --> 11:25.080]  Andrew?
[11:25.840 --> 11:26.160]  Yes.
[11:26.280 --> 11:27.020]  I've made my decision.
[11:27.440 --> 11:28.460]  You've made your decision?
[11:28.660 --> 11:29.320]  Okay, what is your decision?
[11:29.320 --> 11:30.000]  I've made my decision.
[11:30.000 --> 11:30.540]  Nick?
[11:31.380 --> 11:32.860]  It was neither of these two.
[11:33.420 --> 11:34.120]  Neither of them.
[11:35.340 --> 11:39.680]  We are moving on to the next category.
[11:40.520 --> 11:41.400]  Movie I hate.
[11:41.480 --> 11:42.700]  Now, this is an interesting one.
[11:43.200 --> 11:49.440]  Now, the movie that Nick picked for his hated movie was picked by somebody else as well.
[11:50.640 --> 11:51.160]  Wow.
[11:51.860 --> 11:56.520]  So, Nick, you're gonna have to determine who hates this to the point in which they'd list it
[11:56.520 --> 11:57.660]  as much as you do.
[11:58.440 --> 12:01.520]  My hated movie is Napoleon Dynamite.
[12:03.040 --> 12:04.080]  That's my pick.
[12:05.180 --> 12:09.340]  Fucking Napoleon Dynamite is a Jack Petillo special.
[12:09.820 --> 12:13.320]  I was working with him when that movie came out and much like...
[12:13.320 --> 12:18.160]  I love Jack to death, but much like he did with Breaking Bad, he just talked it to death.
[12:18.460 --> 12:23.660]  He was obsessed with that Uncle Rico dude because he was in a movie called Pinballs
[12:23.660 --> 12:24.860]  from the early 80s.
[12:24.980 --> 12:28.300]  And for a brief period of time when he was in...
[12:28.300 --> 12:31.420]  like not interning, but like working with Rooster Teeth before he worked with us full time,
[12:31.880 --> 12:36.320]  he acquired the license to that film and was trying to get a remake made.
[12:36.680 --> 12:40.900]  And he supposedly had that guy, Uncle Rico or Johnny Rico or whatever the fuck his name was,
[12:40.940 --> 12:43.980]  the guy that threw the football, to agree to be in the movie already.
[12:44.080 --> 12:45.760]  And he was just trying to find funding for it.
[12:45.860 --> 12:50.700]  And so there was like a year and a half where all I heard about was Napoleon Dynamite.
[12:50.760 --> 12:53.220]  And I didn't like the movie to begin with, but it really wore me down.
[12:53.220 --> 12:58.340]  Nick, we're around the same age and I did not know that you hated Napoleon Dynamite
[12:58.340 --> 12:59.300]  the same way that I do.
[12:59.740 --> 13:02.060]  It was... you couldn't escape it in high school.
[13:02.460 --> 13:07.780]  Everyone wearing the stupid fucking t-shirt and quoting every stupid line from that movie.
[13:08.280 --> 13:11.900]  Genuinely, this is my most despised film of all time.
[13:12.240 --> 13:15.360]  I have tried to watch it two times.
[13:15.760 --> 13:20.480]  And both times I'm going, I can't believe that anyone fucking made this.
[13:20.660 --> 13:22.680]  I can't believe anybody's watching this.
[13:22.680 --> 13:25.860]  Is this a low budget joke being pulled on me?
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.100]  I genuinely despise Napoleon Dynamite.
[13:29.240 --> 13:33.360]  And I hate what it... I hate what it did for movies after it.
[13:33.580 --> 13:35.500]  Because it just became...
[13:35.500 --> 13:37.980]  Dude, if you put on a vote for Pedro shirt, that's a reference.
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.160]  And then this fucking John Heder guy was never in anything else that was like worthwhile.
[13:43.820 --> 13:46.620]  He's... what? In Blades of Glory? Get real.
[13:47.180 --> 13:48.160]  And Benformers.
[13:48.320 --> 13:50.740]  Napoleon Dynamite sucks shit.
[13:50.740 --> 13:52.100]  I agree with Jeff.
[13:52.220 --> 13:57.580]  If it's a Jack Pattillo special, that really adds another layer for me.
[13:57.860 --> 14:02.980]  But dude, I cannot stand... genuinely despise that movie.
[14:03.300 --> 14:08.340]  Honestly, I'm so excited to talk to you next week about how we both hate that movie.
[14:08.500 --> 14:10.220]  Will we record 100% heat?
[14:10.360 --> 14:12.680]  Because I didn't know you hated this movie also.
[14:12.860 --> 14:13.840]  And this fucking rules.
[14:14.060 --> 14:15.260]  I'm very excited.
[14:15.680 --> 14:19.640]  I'm so... as a hater, as a hater, I'm so excited to talk to you about this.
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.500]  Nick, I'm not particularly excited to talk to you about how much I hate Napoleon Dynamite
[14:24.500 --> 14:26.740]  because we just did it and I don't want to give it any more oxygen.
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.080]  But I will say it was a tough decision between that movie and anything Edgar Wright has directed.
[14:31.420 --> 14:32.120]  Oh, I get that.
[14:32.760 --> 14:35.880]  Nick, I want you to know that as a hater,
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.720]  all I want to do is use oxygen on talking about how much I hate this fucking movie.
[14:40.380 --> 14:42.820]  God, this one, this is so much tougher than the other two.
[14:42.920 --> 14:43.640]  Let me tell you because...
[14:44.160 --> 14:46.640]  Oh, talk about something you love versus talk about something you hate.
[14:46.740 --> 14:47.180]  You got it.
[14:47.180 --> 14:50.840]  So believable because one, you're both in on it.
[14:50.920 --> 14:53.020]  Two, totally believable about Jack.
[14:53.080 --> 14:54.380]  I heard him talk about Breaking Bad.
[14:54.440 --> 14:54.960]  I know how he felt.
[14:55.960 --> 14:58.740]  And then on the other side, Eric, you are my age.
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.220]  I know how you feel about things like this.
[15:01.900 --> 15:05.560]  And the question basically is, I believe you both do not like that movie.
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.940]  I do not know that if it's obviously one of your most hated movies.
[15:10.980 --> 15:12.320]  Yeah, it is my most hated movie.
[15:12.720 --> 15:14.780]  It is genuinely my most...
[15:14.780 --> 15:16.820]  I'm so excited that you listed it also.
[15:17.100 --> 15:18.180]  This fucking rocks.
[15:18.520 --> 15:19.400]  I'm so excited.
[15:19.740 --> 15:27.040]  The only reason I picked it, Nick, is because I hate that driving movie he did, Edgar Wright,
[15:27.580 --> 15:30.620]  equally as much as the stupid ex-girlfriend movie.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.400]  And I couldn't... if he had only directed one of those, I probably would have picked it.
[15:34.440 --> 15:37.400]  But because they kind of canceled each other out, which is why I picked Napoleon Dynamite.
[15:37.460 --> 15:38.500]  Interesting, interesting.
[15:38.740 --> 15:40.160]  Actually, Eric, what would you...
[15:40.800 --> 15:43.280]  If you couldn't have picked this, what would you have picked as your...
[15:43.280 --> 15:43.920]  Oh my God.
[15:43.920 --> 15:44.920]  ...or your most hated movie?
[15:45.040 --> 15:52.620]  I don't... I genuinely don't know, because this was the movie that when I read it and it said,
[15:53.180 --> 15:57.040]  what's a movie you hate? Napoleon Dynamite was the only thing that came to mind.
[15:57.840 --> 16:02.420]  I don't know that I have another movie that is on this level or even approaching it.
[16:02.840 --> 16:05.740]  I do believe it's the one of the two of you, because I think that...
[16:05.740 --> 16:08.240]  I think the answer is ambivalent to it, and I'll bet Gavin...
[16:09.080 --> 16:11.320]  I think... I bet... See, here's the thing.
[16:11.640 --> 16:13.300]  I wouldn't be surprised if Gavin never saw it.
[16:13.300 --> 16:19.000]  I bet Gavin saw it and it was sort of like, whatever. I think Adrian probably enjoyed it,
[16:19.040 --> 16:22.320]  and I don't fault him for that, because he's not wearing a Vilsa Pedro shirt.
[16:24.060 --> 16:24.420]  Or he never saw it.
[16:24.560 --> 16:25.380]  Or he never saw it.
[16:25.520 --> 16:26.000]  Don't think so?
[16:26.200 --> 16:26.560]  For Pedro.
[16:27.500 --> 16:29.060]  I don't think he did, no.
[16:29.180 --> 16:30.040]  It is an election year.
[16:30.420 --> 16:33.040]  How many times have you tried to watch it?
[16:33.300 --> 16:33.960]  Two times.
[16:34.380 --> 16:34.680]  Right?
[16:34.840 --> 16:36.500]  And I've never finished it. I've never finished it.
[16:36.500 --> 16:41.160]  Dude, you just... You get to a point where you go, hey, enough's enough of this.
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.260]  God, I don't even know what to ask, because this is like...
[16:45.260 --> 16:48.080]  I feel like a real camaraderie with you two right now.
[16:49.100 --> 16:50.260]  Like a real...
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.620]  So I'm going to go off of brain power here, okay?
[16:53.240 --> 16:57.020]  I'm putting it out in the universe, and I'm sorry, Jeff, but I'm picking Eric.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.200]  I think this is Eric's least favorite.
[16:58.200 --> 17:00.620]  Hey man, it's your mistake. That's okay.
[17:01.260 --> 17:03.880]  You don't want a wino at the end of this thing, you don't get one.
[17:20.580 --> 17:25.140]  Hey, it's Paris.
[17:25.620 --> 17:28.760]  You know I love sparkly things, right? Like stars.
[17:29.200 --> 17:29.480]  Duh.
[17:30.020 --> 17:33.620]  And thanks to Hilton and AutoCamp, I just slept under them.
[17:34.220 --> 17:38.500]  Picture me, serving looks by the fire outside my luxurious Airstream,
[17:38.500 --> 17:43.260]  making s'mores with the kids, while a national park is our backdrop.
[17:44.020 --> 17:46.260]  The great outdoors meets Hilton hospitality.
[17:46.800 --> 17:47.500]  That's hot.
[17:48.180 --> 17:51.200]  Explore all the new ways to stay at Hilton.com.
[17:51.560 --> 17:52.920]  Hilton for the stay.
[17:53.580 --> 17:57.960]  Next category, same question type, different movie.
[17:58.580 --> 18:01.100]  My hated movie is Armageddon.
[18:01.480 --> 18:03.860]  This is my most hated movie.
[18:03.860 --> 18:08.440]  I don't really even know what to say about it other than I don't,
[18:08.600 --> 18:10.500]  I didn't like Ben Affleck at the time.
[18:10.500 --> 18:13.140]  I'm not really a big, I don't think I like anybody in the film, actually.
[18:13.620 --> 18:14.840]  Except for Bruce Willis.
[18:14.980 --> 18:16.460]  I thought the premise was dumb.
[18:16.560 --> 18:19.400]  I thought Deep Impact was a better, more cerebral version of it.
[18:19.740 --> 18:20.940]  Everybody liked it.
[18:21.040 --> 18:23.900]  And I'm not even going to really spend a lot of time trying to convince you.
[18:24.000 --> 18:25.460]  I just fucking hated that film.
[18:26.060 --> 18:26.700]  I really did.
[18:27.180 --> 18:28.860]  Nick, I want to save you time here.
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.140]  It's not Jeff's.
[18:30.760 --> 18:31.340]  It is mine.
[18:33.960 --> 18:35.200]  All right, so...
[18:35.200 --> 18:38.380]  I just, I just spent so much time lying about Napoleon Dynamite
[18:38.380 --> 18:41.780]  because I don't have the energy to be truthful about Armageddon.
[18:42.120 --> 18:44.160]  That's why I'm telling you, you can't trust this guy.
[18:44.420 --> 18:45.300]  That's what I'm saying.
[18:45.580 --> 18:46.740]  You gotta trust me here.
[18:47.180 --> 18:48.840]  But he's playing the game, I understand.
[18:49.160 --> 18:50.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[18:50.560 --> 18:50.980]  He's right.
[18:51.100 --> 18:52.320]  We all know he's playing the game.
[18:52.600 --> 18:56.840]  The thing where he like does the animal cracker across Liv Tyler's stomach
[18:56.840 --> 18:59.800]  with his stupid Australian accent, it makes me...
[18:59.800 --> 19:01.040]  Oh, I fucking hate that film.
[19:01.580 --> 19:02.740]  I hate the soundtrack.
[19:02.740 --> 19:03.880]  I hate Aerosmith.
[19:04.620 --> 19:05.980]  I don't know if you guys know that about me.
[19:06.160 --> 19:07.320]  I've never liked Aerosmith.
[19:07.600 --> 19:11.060]  I find them to be really...
[19:13.480 --> 19:14.200]  Disgusting's not the right word.
[19:14.220 --> 19:14.760]  That's too mean.
[19:14.880 --> 19:16.020]  But just like, just icky.
[19:16.260 --> 19:16.760]  I don't like them.
[19:16.840 --> 19:17.260]  It bugs me.
[19:17.400 --> 19:20.100]  And they were so imbued with that stupid film.
[19:21.040 --> 19:22.420]  And every asshole...
[19:22.420 --> 19:24.120]  I was in the army when that movie came out.
[19:24.240 --> 19:28.680]  And every asshole in the army was fucking gung-ho about it and thought it was super cool.
[19:28.840 --> 19:30.960]  And so it was, it just plagued me.
[19:32.600 --> 19:34.980]  Again, I'm just going to be really clear.
[19:35.240 --> 19:36.440]  This is, it's not Jeff's.
[19:36.580 --> 19:38.340]  Well, let me ask you this then, Eric.
[19:38.380 --> 19:39.020]  Whose would it be?
[19:39.140 --> 19:41.280]  I think it's, it's, I think it's...
[19:41.280 --> 19:43.040]  Boy, I want to say it's Gavin's.
[19:43.500 --> 19:45.560]  It wouldn't surprise me if it was Andrew's.
[19:45.900 --> 19:46.860]  But it's definitely not Jeff's.
[19:46.860 --> 19:50.660]  If you don't pick me here, you're giving, you're giving Eric a point, I think.
[19:51.140 --> 19:52.240]  No, I don't think he gets anything.
[19:52.360 --> 19:52.920]  Oh, okay.
[19:52.980 --> 19:53.680]  Well, in that case, no.
[19:53.800 --> 19:56.940]  Yeah, then I don't know why he would be trying to dissuade you from scoring.
[19:57.140 --> 19:58.380]  It's, it's definitely me.
[19:59.000 --> 19:59.960]  It's definitely not Jeff.
[19:59.960 --> 20:04.140]  I, the only reason I was able to bitch so much about Napoleon Dynamite is,
[20:04.360 --> 20:06.580]  is because I would have picked that movie had it come to my mind.
[20:06.940 --> 20:08.160]  I'm different than Eric.
[20:08.300 --> 20:09.480]  I hate lots of stuff.
[20:09.760 --> 20:11.080]  And I, I can call...
[20:11.080 --> 20:13.380]  Yeah, you know me, I'm a serial liker.
[20:13.760 --> 20:15.000]  Yeah, you know how much I like shit.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.480]  I'm not, I'm not a guy who's like, what's your, what's a movie you hate?
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.920]  And I'm like, oh, I can only think of one.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.600]  I can think of volumes of films that I hate.
[20:23.220 --> 20:26.380]  Napoleon Dynamite didn't come to mind, but Armageddon did.
[20:27.160 --> 20:28.500]  And so that's the one I picked.
[20:28.500 --> 20:31.620]  If this was really Jeff's, he wouldn't be able to...
[20:31.620 --> 20:32.780]  It'd be an Edgar Wright film.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.800]  Here's, if, if this was really Jeff's, he wouldn't,
[20:36.080 --> 20:39.080]  it would be so, with so much more fervor that he hates it.
[20:39.080 --> 20:40.240]  It's just, I'm just tired.
[20:40.740 --> 20:42.020]  It's 100% mine.
[20:42.180 --> 20:43.020]  I picked Armageddon.
[20:43.140 --> 20:46.760]  Nick, dude, I'm telling you, fucking buddy to buddy,
[20:47.500 --> 20:49.120]  basketball fan to basketball fan.
[20:49.140 --> 20:51.260]  If you pick me here, you're gonna, we're both gonna get a point.
[20:51.640 --> 20:52.240]  Jeff likes Armageddon.
[20:52.320 --> 20:53.400]  I think Jeff likes Armageddon.
[20:53.700 --> 20:54.840]  I get nothing.
[20:54.900 --> 20:57.580]  I get nothing for, for tricking you, do I?
[20:58.060 --> 20:59.260]  Yeah, you do. You get a point.
[20:59.600 --> 21:00.640]  Oh, well, I'm not trying to trick you.
[21:00.740 --> 21:01.600]  I'm trying to get a point.
[21:02.480 --> 21:04.220]  So he's trying to trick you.
[21:04.420 --> 21:07.700]  And I'm telling you, it's like, well, why wouldn't Eric get a point?
[21:07.740 --> 21:09.440]  Well, does Eric gets a point for tricking him?
[21:09.760 --> 21:13.180]  Well, no, he's, Eric is not trying to convince him that it's his pick.
[21:13.260 --> 21:15.240]  He's trying to say that it's nobody's.
[21:15.300 --> 21:16.300]  Oh, right, right, right.
[21:16.380 --> 21:18.540]  Well, I'm trying to convince you that it's my pick because it is.
[21:18.600 --> 21:20.140]  It was not Napoleon Dynamite.
[21:20.280 --> 21:24.100]  I, although I wish I thought of it because I do hate that movie as much as Armageddon
[21:24.100 --> 21:28.740]  and as much as Edgar Wright films and as much as a bunch of other films I could list.
[21:28.940 --> 21:30.760]  Hurley Burley, I left the theater in.
[21:30.840 --> 21:32.660]  I couldn't get through fucking 20 minutes of that film.
[21:33.520 --> 21:35.300]  But that didn't come to mind either.
[21:35.500 --> 21:36.680]  It was, it was just Armageddon.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.540]  Now, my concern here, Jeff, is that you mentioned if you hadn't thought of Napoleon Dynamite,
[21:41.580 --> 21:42.880]  you'd have gone with an Edgar Wright film.
[21:43.280 --> 21:47.760]  Yeah, because I thought I was just trying to come up with shit to, to, to convince you.
[21:47.920 --> 21:49.020]  I do hate Edgar Wright.
[21:49.080 --> 21:49.300]  You know what?
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.380]  I do hate Edgar Wright.
[21:50.420 --> 21:53.080]  And I wish I would have thought I really hate that Scott Pilgrim movie.
[21:54.100 --> 21:57.180]  And then I couldn't, and I actually thought in my head, I don't, I think I hate Scott Pilgrim
[21:57.180 --> 21:58.220]  more than Napoleon Dynamite.
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.280]  So how do I, I had to justify it to myself by saying, well, I hate the Baby Driver movie
[22:02.280 --> 22:04.300]  as much as I hate Scott Pilgrim.
[22:04.400 --> 22:06.640]  So they cancel each other out so I could pick the Napoleon Dynamite.
[22:06.740 --> 22:09.520]  But that's all subterfuge because I really wrote down Armageddon.
[22:10.440 --> 22:12.140]  Andrew, Andrew, I've made my decision.
[22:12.280 --> 22:12.920]  You've made your choice, Nick.
[22:12.920 --> 22:15.920]  I'm going, it is neither of these two gentlemen.
[22:15.980 --> 22:16.900]  You are fucking up, dude.
[22:18.520 --> 22:19.300]  Good choice, Nick.
[22:20.240 --> 22:20.820]  Thanks, man.
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.280]  Nick, you really fucked up.
[22:22.280 --> 22:25.040]  I'm so excited to talk to you about Napoleon Dynamite next week.
[22:25.060 --> 22:25.580]  You have no idea.
[22:25.980 --> 22:26.840]  I'm so fucking thrilled.
[22:27.180 --> 22:28.500]  I'm so, I didn't know you didn't like it either.
[22:28.700 --> 22:31.060]  You might have picked right there, but you fucked up on this one.
[22:31.600 --> 22:35.580]  I have no idea if that's Eric or not, but Armageddon was me.
[22:36.140 --> 22:39.260]  Oh, well, oh, no, it wasn't.
[22:39.480 --> 22:42.480]  A song I love is any song by Madonna.
[22:42.960 --> 22:43.680]  That's me as well.
[22:44.720 --> 22:51.640]  I am a Madonna music unapologist.
[22:51.740 --> 22:54.280]  I love all of her music, her entire catalog.
[22:54.460 --> 22:57.640]  I considered getting a Madonna tattoo for the longest time.
[22:58.080 --> 22:59.260]  I thought that would be really funny.
[22:59.560 --> 23:02.580]  And then she got Instagram and it changed my mind.
[23:02.700 --> 23:04.440]  Instagram Madonna, I'm not as into.
[23:04.840 --> 23:06.700]  But Madonna's music, I absolutely love.
[23:06.840 --> 23:07.840]  I grew up with her.
[23:07.840 --> 23:10.620]  I got one of my first ever boners
[23:10.620 --> 23:15.280]  to the Like A Virgin live performance that she did at the MTV Music Awards.
[23:15.760 --> 23:19.660]  Back when I was like the age where I could first start popping boners.
[23:19.880 --> 23:22.920]  I have been enamored with her since Lucky Star,
[23:23.120 --> 23:25.340]  which is the first Madonna song I ever heard.
[23:25.860 --> 23:27.380]  And I have the Immaculate Collection.
[23:27.800 --> 23:30.560]  I beat off to the sex book in high school.
[23:30.720 --> 23:33.400]  Like I've been, I've been a Madonna fan my entire life.
[23:33.400 --> 23:35.940]  Oh, God, I regret asking this question.
[23:39.810 --> 23:41.930]  Eric, what's your response?
[23:42.570 --> 23:44.530]  That's absolutely vile.
[23:44.730 --> 23:48.250]  I listed this because everything before 2003, Madonna is good.
[23:48.330 --> 23:52.110]  American Life is the last album that I think that you could really listen to
[23:52.110 --> 23:53.110]  all the way through and be like,
[23:53.190 --> 23:55.450]  oh, OK, because she started going confessions on the dance floor.
[23:55.550 --> 23:56.730]  And it's too throwback.
[23:56.830 --> 23:58.710]  When you have Ray of Light in 98.
[23:58.910 --> 23:59.530]  Here's the thing, Nick.
[23:59.610 --> 24:00.890]  Again, we're around the same age.
[24:02.050 --> 24:03.530]  VH1, gigantic in that time.
[24:03.610 --> 24:05.530]  An adult contemporary with Ray of Light
[24:05.530 --> 24:09.470]  and everything that she did around that time is huge.
[24:09.890 --> 24:15.530]  And so what happens there is you go back and you listen to True Blue, her first album.
[24:16.250 --> 24:19.190]  He is just making shit up right now to justify.
[24:19.650 --> 24:22.950]  He's just talking Madonna, but he's not talking about why he likes Madonna.
[24:23.210 --> 24:26.790]  I'm telling you why I picked Madonna, because I love Madonna,
[24:26.990 --> 24:31.730]  because I have been in love with Madonna since I was able to be in love with women.
[24:32.310 --> 24:34.870]  And she was like, she was the coolest.
[24:34.870 --> 24:37.030]  She was the Lady Gaga of her era.
[24:37.290 --> 24:40.710]  And my entire life, Madonna has been, up until very recently,
[24:40.950 --> 24:43.750]  has been like at the top of her game.
[24:44.090 --> 24:46.130]  And I have been a fan the entire time.
[24:46.330 --> 24:48.470]  I fucking stayed up to watch the stupid...
[24:50.070 --> 24:54.850]  What was the Pepsi commercial video that caused so much trouble?
[24:54.930 --> 24:55.390]  What was that?
[24:56.150 --> 24:59.570]  Where she kissed Jesus and Jesus was black and everybody got upset?
[25:00.470 --> 25:02.350]  I even stayed up late on a Sunday night to watch that.
[25:02.430 --> 25:04.310]  I've been such a Madonna fan my entire life.
[25:04.870 --> 25:06.130]  I wish I got that tattoo now.
[25:06.190 --> 25:09.230]  Nick, here's some examples.
[25:09.790 --> 25:13.730]  What I'm telling you is that Madonna is someone
[25:13.730 --> 25:16.810]  that has been in the zeitgeist for so long that...
[25:16.810 --> 25:18.990]  I'm tweeting about Madonna.
[25:19.490 --> 25:24.150]  I'm telling you that Carly Rae Jepsen is just Madonna for people
[25:24.150 --> 25:26.190]  that never listened to her first album,
[25:26.330 --> 25:29.630]  that don't know physical attraction, holiday, burning up, and borderline.
[25:29.730 --> 25:30.730]  I don't think that's right at all.
[25:30.750 --> 25:33.010]  Jeff is going to talk about, oh yeah, Lucky Star.
[25:33.010 --> 25:33.850]  Wow, cool, man.
[25:33.950 --> 25:35.650]  The first song on the first album.
[25:36.050 --> 25:36.810]  Deep cut.
[25:36.830 --> 25:39.710]  Yeah, since the fucking first day I've been a Madonna fan.
[25:39.710 --> 25:42.830]  Grow up and listen to bedtime stories, stupid ho.
[25:43.130 --> 25:45.270]  You got to get deep on this shit.
[25:45.710 --> 25:48.470]  When I'm saying anything by Madonna,
[25:49.090 --> 25:52.570]  I mean secret human nature, forbidden love sanctuary,
[25:53.030 --> 25:55.470]  bedtime stories, deep cut shit.
[25:56.110 --> 25:57.470]  Eric would have picked a song or an album.
[25:57.690 --> 25:58.690]  I picked a whole catalog.
[25:59.050 --> 25:59.730]  He wouldn't have done that.
[25:59.770 --> 26:00.570]  He's too specific.
[26:00.570 --> 26:03.310]  He's too persnickety about it.
[26:03.430 --> 26:04.790]  Eric would have told you a song.
[26:04.870 --> 26:06.590]  He would have just said this song by Madonna.
[26:07.070 --> 26:09.830]  I picked her entire catalog because I love Madonna.
[26:09.970 --> 26:11.350]  Anything by Madonna is what I said.
[26:13.190 --> 26:15.430]  Now, I'm not even going to ask a question.
[26:15.650 --> 26:16.170]  And here's why.
[26:16.810 --> 26:17.930]  You're both very passionate.
[26:18.550 --> 26:20.130]  So I believe that it's one of the two of you.
[26:20.390 --> 26:23.910]  However, since the answer was all Madonna songs,
[26:24.150 --> 26:25.610]  or like anything by Madonna,
[26:25.810 --> 26:28.390]  I think Eric saying anything after 2003,
[26:28.530 --> 26:29.650]  not to be as big a fan of,
[26:29.650 --> 26:31.190]  I'm going to go with Jeff on this one.
[26:31.710 --> 26:32.510]  All right.
[26:32.570 --> 26:33.350]  That is your decision?
[26:33.830 --> 26:34.110]  You blew it.
[26:34.170 --> 26:34.870]  That is my decision.
[26:35.590 --> 26:35.890]  All right.
[26:36.030 --> 26:37.450]  I'm glad you guys aren't revealing it to me
[26:37.450 --> 26:38.690]  because it's really making me sweat.
[26:39.050 --> 26:40.350]  Yeah, well, you should pick right.
[26:40.470 --> 26:41.270]  I don't know what to tell you.
[26:41.570 --> 26:42.290]  I agree with Eric.
[26:42.370 --> 26:43.290]  You got to start picking right.
[26:43.650 --> 26:47.310]  Dude, borderline is maybe one of the best songs
[26:47.310 --> 26:48.930]  ever fucking written.
[26:49.150 --> 26:50.490]  And you picked Jeff.
[26:50.950 --> 26:51.790]  Get real.
[26:52.150 --> 26:53.450]  It's because he knows the right answer.
[26:54.150 --> 26:54.910]  Next category.
[26:55.670 --> 26:58.310]  A song I hate is Hurt So Good.
[26:58.310 --> 27:05.040]  Uh, I don't even know what that song,
[27:05.120 --> 27:05.760]  Hurt So Good.
[27:06.700 --> 27:07.860]  I can't even lie.
[27:07.920 --> 27:09.760]  Come on baby, make it hurt so good.
[27:09.760 --> 27:09.980]  Exactly.
[27:11.620 --> 27:12.660]  John Mellencamp.
[27:12.900 --> 27:15.560]  Hey, we're going to call you John Cougar Mellencamp.
[27:15.900 --> 27:17.300]  What a fucking dipshit.
[27:17.460 --> 27:20.420]  You talk about a guy who's been around for too long
[27:20.420 --> 27:22.260]  and it was only a short amount of time.
[27:22.520 --> 27:25.880]  It's John Cougar Mellencamp.
[27:26.240 --> 27:28.420]  Hurt so good sucks shit.
[27:28.840 --> 27:30.280]  I fucking hate.
[27:30.640 --> 27:31.420]  That song.
[27:31.520 --> 27:33.000]  I think that song.
[27:33.100 --> 27:34.640]  Here's the problem with that song.
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.140]  It's a karaoke staple and it fucking shouldn't be.
[27:39.240 --> 27:42.520]  The problem with karaoke songs is that it's like,
[27:42.560 --> 27:45.520]  oh yeah, you gotta, you gotta pick stuff that people know and everything.
[27:45.700 --> 27:45.860]  Great.
[27:45.980 --> 27:46.820]  Pick Jack and Diane.
[27:47.400 --> 27:49.400]  Pick anything that isn't,
[27:49.680 --> 27:52.060]  pick R-O-C-K in the USA.
[27:52.620 --> 27:56.260]  Pick anything that isn't fucking hurt so good.
[27:56.740 --> 27:58.960]  John Cougar Mellencamp sucks shit.
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.880]  That's the dirt worst fucking song in the world.
[28:06.600 --> 28:08.160]  It's not, it's not me.
[28:08.340 --> 28:10.520]  I can't, I can't pretend not to like that song.
[28:10.580 --> 28:12.860]  I couldn't even call it to my mind when I was thinking of it.
[28:13.040 --> 28:14.680]  So it could be Eric.
[28:14.840 --> 28:15.700]  I don't know.
[28:16.380 --> 28:19.200]  I will say I've never heard anybody sing that song in karaoke
[28:19.200 --> 28:20.640]  and I've heard a lot of karaoke.
[28:20.860 --> 28:21.660]  I don't know why.
[28:21.800 --> 28:24.560]  I don't know why he, he brought the karaoke part up.
[28:24.880 --> 28:26.720]  Look at this motherfucker.
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.240]  I hate.
[28:28.240 --> 28:30.740]  I hate this song.
[28:30.980 --> 28:32.560]  It's the fakest bullshit.
[28:32.780 --> 28:33.440]  Oh, I hate it.
[28:33.720 --> 28:34.120]  Fuck.
[28:34.760 --> 28:35.220]  Look it.
[28:36.240 --> 28:37.040]  He sucks.
[28:37.060 --> 28:43.460]  Now I'm fairly in tune with Eric's music taste because I'm also a big fan of Yacht Rock and,
[28:43.500 --> 28:45.280]  you know, newer stuff I'll give a chance to.
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.140]  But this song I also despise.
[28:47.300 --> 28:49.220]  So I am leaning towards Eric at the moment.
[28:49.580 --> 28:51.700]  But I would like to know, Eric, where,
[28:52.780 --> 28:56.640]  if you had to pick any other song that you hated off the top of your head right now,
[28:56.640 --> 28:58.600]  just without hesitating, what is it?
[28:58.680 --> 28:59.240]  Sweet Caroline.
[28:59.960 --> 29:00.460]  Fuck.
[29:00.700 --> 29:01.060]  That's a good song.
[29:01.080 --> 29:01.220]  It's you.
[29:01.660 --> 29:01.880]  See?
[29:02.700 --> 29:09.780]  Like, Nick, these are songs that are drunk karaoke staples that suck shit.
[29:10.540 --> 29:11.520]  These are...
[29:11.520 --> 29:12.760]  Well, they sucked when they started.
[29:12.940 --> 29:13.660]  Exact, exact.
[29:13.820 --> 29:14.540]  That's the problem.
[29:14.820 --> 29:17.240]  And Hurt So Good is the type of song.
[29:17.320 --> 29:19.880]  I still have never heard anybody sing that in karaoke.
[29:20.560 --> 29:25.940]  Hurt So Good is a drunk mom karaoke song where she knows the chorus and none of the verse.
[29:27.640 --> 29:28.200]  Yep.
[29:28.640 --> 29:28.960]  Uh-huh.
[29:29.340 --> 29:29.900]  That's it.
[29:30.100 --> 29:31.140]  I'm going with Eric, Andrew.
[29:31.180 --> 29:31.280]  Okay.
[29:31.300 --> 29:31.760]  I'm going with Eric.
[29:31.960 --> 29:33.180]  Your choice is Eric.
[29:34.220 --> 29:34.580]  Okay.
[29:35.100 --> 29:39.800]  A massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, especially these days.
[29:40.300 --> 29:46.680]  Eight different settings, adjustable intensity, plus it's heated and it just feels so good.
[29:47.940 --> 29:52.380]  Yes, a massage chair might seem a bit extravagant, but when it can come with a car,
[29:54.040 --> 29:55.960]  suddenly it seems quite practical.
[29:55.960 --> 29:59.100]  The all-new 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan,
[29:59.440 --> 30:04.600]  packed with premium features like available massaging front seats, it only feels extravagant.

[30:31.500 --> 30:34.340]  Next category, TV show I love.
[30:35.040 --> 30:36.220]  Oh, interesting.
[30:36.520 --> 30:36.960]  Friends.
[30:37.720 --> 30:38.500]  This is me.
[30:39.300 --> 30:41.180]  I picked this because I...
[30:41.180 --> 30:44.820]  I'm just going to let Jeff wear himself out so that way I can actually talk about this.
[30:44.900 --> 30:45.020]  Go ahead.
[30:45.220 --> 30:47.140]  I picked this. I'm just going to be honest with you.
[30:47.180 --> 30:48.060]  I'll just get out of the way real quick.
[30:48.100 --> 30:51.800]  And then Eric can yell and scream and talk for a long time and say very little.
[30:51.800 --> 30:54.040]  But what I'm going to say is I...
[30:54.720 --> 30:59.200]  Once again, Andrew asked me to pick a show that I like that people don't think I like.
[30:59.320 --> 31:03.400]  And I have a bit of an embarrassing admission.
[31:03.720 --> 31:06.000]  I have always considered myself a Seinfeld guy.
[31:06.640 --> 31:09.340]  And I have always kind of shit on Friends.
[31:09.460 --> 31:12.360]  But it's because I never really watched it until I met Emily.
[31:12.940 --> 31:15.280]  And she is kind of quietly a big Friends fan.
[31:15.440 --> 31:17.820]  And so it's always kind of been on in the background.
[31:17.820 --> 31:23.340]  And I discovered begrudgingly over the past seven years that it was a pretty good show.
[31:23.560 --> 31:27.400]  And I don't like to talk about it because I don't want Bernie and Matt and Gavin specifically
[31:27.820 --> 31:30.980]  to make fun of me for all the years I shit-talked it to them.
[31:31.260 --> 31:33.500]  So I wrote that down. It is me.
[31:33.800 --> 31:34.780]  And that's all I'm going to say.
[31:34.840 --> 31:36.100]  I'll answer any questions you want.
[31:36.260 --> 31:38.780]  But I wouldn't say I'm like the biggest fan in the world of it or anything.
[31:38.980 --> 31:39.240]  I just...
[31:40.640 --> 31:41.360]  I'm embarrassed.
[31:41.540 --> 31:45.580]  But I feel like if we're going to be embarrassed, we should admit it on camera.
[31:45.760 --> 31:46.900]  That's kind of what we do here.
[31:46.900 --> 31:50.120]  I am a late-in-life Friends fan.
[31:50.340 --> 31:51.760]  Thanks to my wife, Emily.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.860]  I own the cassette.
[31:54.960 --> 31:59.020]  From Marcel the monkey to Ms. Chanandler Bong,
[31:59.860 --> 32:03.540]  Friends is probably one of my favorite TV shows.
[32:03.820 --> 32:06.040]  And I don't really care that people know or not.
[32:06.740 --> 32:09.100]  I loved watching Friends when it first aired.
[32:09.560 --> 32:11.880]  Again, around the same age, Nick.
[32:12.080 --> 32:13.680]  Way too young to be watching Friends.
[32:13.920 --> 32:15.840]  Still watched it all the time.
[32:16.400 --> 32:17.400]  I love Friends.
[32:17.820 --> 32:19.480]  Again, I own the cassette.
[32:19.780 --> 32:24.300]  Has, I think, a Bare Naked Ladies song on it or maybe two.
[32:24.860 --> 32:26.320]  And it is...
[32:27.120 --> 32:27.860]  Shouldn't have owned it.
[32:28.060 --> 32:31.240]  Shouldn't have watched the show at the tender age of probably nine.
[32:32.340 --> 32:36.060]  I don't think that the last season is very good.
[32:36.580 --> 32:38.400]  I guess the last two with Paul Rudd.
[32:38.540 --> 32:39.320]  Those suck shit.
[32:39.700 --> 32:41.360]  But the rest of it, I think it's great.
[32:41.460 --> 32:45.060]  I think through the first five seasons, Friends is such a strong TV show.
[32:45.240 --> 32:45.620]  It's great.
[32:46.000 --> 32:47.260]  It is me.
[32:48.140 --> 32:50.080]  I really wish I still had this cassette.
[32:50.680 --> 32:53.180]  Just remember, Nick, it can't be Eric every time.
[32:53.280 --> 32:54.880]  There are four other answers out there.
[32:54.940 --> 32:55.540]  It's true.
[32:55.700 --> 33:00.100]  But you also have to think about how Andrew is gaming this thing to kind of screw with your head.
[33:00.720 --> 33:01.660]  Oh, yeah, it is.
[33:01.740 --> 33:02.580]  Let me tell you, it is.
[33:03.680 --> 33:05.720]  So how many seasons did the show run, Eric?
[33:05.880 --> 33:06.060]  10.
[33:06.800 --> 33:10.020]  Remember the last season where they're all making over a million because they weren't going to do it?
[33:10.700 --> 33:13.780]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[33:13.780 --> 33:15.460]  What was your favorite arc?
[33:16.500 --> 33:22.120]  Uh, remember when it's the end of season boy, is it the end of season two or the end of season three
[33:22.120 --> 33:28.860]  where Ben Stiller's wife is in it as Bonnie and then she's dating Ross and they go to the beach
[33:28.860 --> 33:31.160]  and then Rachel convinces her to shave her head?
[33:31.460 --> 33:33.660]  It's the sort of like Ross Rachel.
[33:33.800 --> 33:35.780]  Oh, he's her lobster, like that kind of thing.
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.140]  I think that's probably like my favorite end of the season, beginning of the season
[33:40.060 --> 33:40.980]  moment with that.
[33:41.400 --> 33:43.680]  Also, I like when when Ross had the pants.
[33:44.880 --> 33:46.400]  Oh, yeah, the leather pants.
[33:46.640 --> 33:48.740]  And he tries to pull them up and he hits himself in the face.
[33:48.800 --> 33:49.260]  That's funny.
[33:49.820 --> 33:51.960]  Jeff, what was your favorite outside of that one?
[33:52.000 --> 33:53.780]  So you can't pick that one if you could.
[33:53.960 --> 33:57.020]  What is your next favorite arc in the show?
[33:57.500 --> 33:59.040]  Oh, dude, I can't sit.
[33:59.160 --> 34:02.380]  I couldn't name you an arc for Seinfeld or Friends right now.
[34:02.460 --> 34:07.180]  It's a TV show that's on in the background that when I look at, I enjoy and I get like dumb laughs at.
[34:07.780 --> 34:10.340]  I guess I yeah, I don't really know.
[34:10.480 --> 34:11.740]  I don't like I'll be honest.
[34:11.740 --> 34:13.220]  I didn't even know that Paul Rudd was in the show.
[34:13.220 --> 34:14.540]  I may not have seen those seasons.
[34:14.740 --> 34:17.500]  So it's just kind of like it's kind of like a background show for me.
[34:17.640 --> 34:20.140]  She watches Veep and she watches Friends.
[34:20.480 --> 34:22.220]  And so it's always one of those two shows.
[34:22.320 --> 34:23.600]  I like Veep a lot.
[34:23.740 --> 34:27.080]  I also probably couldn't tell you any Veep storylines because it's not something I like
[34:27.080 --> 34:28.480]  sit down and focus on.
[34:28.840 --> 34:34.100]  I definitely didn't own a tape like Eric or anything, but it's just a show that I told
[34:34.100 --> 34:36.580]  people I hated and I hated it because I'd never seen it.
[34:36.700 --> 34:39.180]  And then I watched it, you know, begrudgingly.
[34:39.180 --> 34:40.780]  And I like it.
[34:40.780 --> 34:44.140]  I don't like it enough to remember fucking whole seasons or anything, though.
[34:44.380 --> 34:47.700]  Hey, remember when Chandler was in the ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre?
[34:48.340 --> 34:48.820]  Oh, yeah.
[34:48.880 --> 34:50.740]  I was going to ask you what your favorite cameo is.
[34:50.820 --> 34:53.920]  But it's probably that it's that or it's you also mentioned Paul Rudd.
[34:54.020 --> 34:56.800]  And yeah, I think I think Janice coming back over and over again.
[34:56.900 --> 34:57.480]  That's pretty good.
[34:57.540 --> 34:57.880]  Tag.
[34:58.140 --> 34:58.800]  Tag sucked.
[34:59.360 --> 35:00.080]  I hated Tag.
[35:00.780 --> 35:01.700]  He was he was the worst.
[35:01.800 --> 35:02.600]  Yeah, he was born too young.
[35:02.780 --> 35:03.320]  Yeah, big.
[35:03.400 --> 35:04.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.920]  Uh, now I here's my issue.
[35:07.920 --> 35:09.900]  I know I believe.
[35:10.080 --> 35:11.240]  Didn't Gavin have like DVDs?
[35:11.360 --> 35:12.460]  He's a huge fan.
[35:12.880 --> 35:13.240]  Huge.
[35:13.500 --> 35:17.340]  But he's but he so I don't think he would say I'm a friend of this.
[35:17.460 --> 35:21.100]  I'm a fan of this show on a question that says secretly.
[35:21.300 --> 35:21.540]  Right.
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.540]  Yeah, I agree.
[35:22.580 --> 35:23.200]  He wouldn't just.
[35:26.000 --> 35:26.860]  It's too obvious.
[35:26.960 --> 35:29.440]  It's the first show that comes to mind when you think Gavin.
[35:30.260 --> 35:33.400]  And I don't I don't and I don't remember Andrew ever talking about it.
[35:33.560 --> 35:35.100]  He may have been probably too young for it.
[35:35.140 --> 35:37.720]  Because like Eric said, when you and I were too young for it at the time.
[35:37.720 --> 35:39.860]  I definitely heard Andrew talk about friends before.
[35:40.100 --> 35:40.500]  For sure.
[35:40.600 --> 35:41.720]  Is that right?
[35:42.120 --> 35:42.760]  I think so.
[35:42.900 --> 35:43.260]  I think so.
[35:43.280 --> 35:44.860]  Andrew, who's your favorite friends character?
[35:45.200 --> 35:47.420]  I like Ross, but I'm not part of this game.
[35:47.500 --> 35:47.860]  Hell yeah.
[35:48.600 --> 35:50.900]  I mean, you are in a way part of this game.
[35:51.020 --> 35:51.780]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:51.840 --> 35:52.960]  I mean, think about it, Nick.
[35:53.660 --> 35:55.900]  Everyone's favorite character, Ross.
[35:56.940 --> 35:57.700]  Yeah, Ross.
[36:00.120 --> 36:00.700]  Yeah, everybody.
[36:01.180 --> 36:01.920]  David Schwimmer.
[36:02.300 --> 36:03.340]  Hey, he was good in Band of Brothers.
[36:03.600 --> 36:05.180]  Remember when Padgett Brewster was in it?
[36:05.200 --> 36:07.700]  And that's when Joey and Chandler stopped being friends.
[36:08.260 --> 36:10.200]  And then Chandler had to be inside the box.
[36:10.620 --> 36:14.660]  He's just gonna wear you down reciting shit that he's remembering or Googling right now.
[36:15.260 --> 36:16.240]  Well, here's the other thing.
[36:16.320 --> 36:19.580]  I'm also worried that it's a TikTok trend that he went through at a certain point.
[36:19.900 --> 36:21.360]  No, that's Mad Men.
[36:22.540 --> 36:26.160]  I know Mad Men popped through, and I also know that Sopranos did as well.
[36:26.540 --> 36:27.400]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[36:27.620 --> 36:28.760]  No, that's the new one.
[36:28.940 --> 36:32.380]  I will say we haven't watched Friends in a while because Emily's been watching Sopranos
[36:32.380 --> 36:32.660]  so much.
[36:32.680 --> 36:33.400]  But we're past that.
[36:33.460 --> 36:34.120]  Now it's West Wing.
[36:35.040 --> 36:36.180]  Oh, walk and talk, baby.
[36:40.760 --> 36:42.800]  I... Jeff, I don't think it's you.
[36:42.960 --> 36:43.200]  Okay.
[36:43.700 --> 36:45.240]  I also don't think it's Jeff.
[36:45.560 --> 36:51.860]  I don't think Gavin would put that unless he was just phoning it in.
[36:53.340 --> 36:54.660]  So I'm gonna go with Eric.
[36:54.800 --> 36:55.360]  I think it's Eric.
[36:55.440 --> 36:56.120]  Hell yeah, good pick.
[36:56.240 --> 36:57.380]  I think you made a mistake.
[36:58.120 --> 36:58.160]  Yeah.
[36:59.460 --> 37:01.300]  The only thing I didn't watch was the reunion.
[37:01.500 --> 37:03.060]  I didn't feel like we needed to watch the reunion.
[37:03.160 --> 37:03.760]  Par for the course.
[37:04.960 --> 37:05.800]  Alright, thanks, man.
[37:05.800 --> 37:10.140]  Last question before we start revealing these results.
[37:11.180 --> 37:12.700]  A TV show that I hate?
[37:13.540 --> 37:13.940]  Friends.
[37:14.740 --> 37:16.760]  Goddamn, you're picking me every time.
[37:17.140 --> 37:17.720]  It is me.
[37:17.820 --> 37:19.080]  I can't fucking stand Friends.
[37:19.440 --> 37:20.380]  I've never seen it.
[37:20.480 --> 37:21.340]  I don't like it.
[37:21.680 --> 37:26.020]  Bernie and Gavin and Matt fucking were so up its ass for so long.
[37:26.120 --> 37:27.080]  I'm a Seinfeld guy.
[37:27.180 --> 37:28.980]  I made up everything I said before this.
[37:29.300 --> 37:30.780]  Can't stand that fucking show.
[37:30.880 --> 37:33.020]  Couldn't name you five characters from it.
[37:33.020 --> 37:34.800]  Did know Paul Rudd was in it.
[37:34.900 --> 37:35.980]  Pretended like I didn't earlier.
[37:37.020 --> 37:39.340]  Had nothing positive to say about Friends.
[37:40.520 --> 37:41.540]  And I don't know.
[37:41.660 --> 37:42.720]  Jeff, I'm going to stop you right there.
[37:43.080 --> 37:43.460]  It's you.
[37:43.620 --> 37:44.120]  Yeah, it's me.
[37:44.540 --> 37:47.280]  I'm not, I mean, I'm not even going to bother to make an argument.
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.340]  I was going to try to go for something like, oh no, it's Andrew.
[37:51.840 --> 37:52.740]  Probably it's Andrew.
[37:54.360 --> 37:55.940]  Yeah, we could just get this over with.
[37:56.400 --> 37:57.320]  Yeah, it's absolutely me.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.340]  I can't fucking stand Friends.
[37:58.480 --> 38:00.120]  It was hard to pretend to like it there for a bit.
[38:00.460 --> 38:01.740]  Emily's not a Friends person.
[38:01.740 --> 38:03.460]  She doesn't watch Friends.
[38:03.460 --> 38:05.320]  All the other TV shows I mentioned she is.
[38:05.520 --> 38:07.240]  I bet I just threw Friends in there to for.
[38:07.720 --> 38:08.860]  Yeah, well, I like Friends to Veep.
[38:08.960 --> 38:10.060]  That's where I was like, oh, it's not.
[38:10.240 --> 38:11.520]  She doesn't watch Friends in the background.
[38:12.520 --> 38:14.540]  We've gone through all the categories for now.
[38:14.620 --> 38:18.540]  Let's now go through the actual results of this game.
[38:19.360 --> 38:21.620]  The first question was a movie that I love.
[38:21.660 --> 38:22.740]  And I said The Mummy.
[38:23.420 --> 38:26.880]  Nick, you said that that was neither Eric nor Jeff.
[38:26.900 --> 38:28.660]  How do you feel about that at this stage?
[38:29.280 --> 38:30.760]  I'm feeling worse now that you're asking me that.
[38:30.760 --> 38:31.540]  I'm just going through.
[38:31.640 --> 38:32.100]  I'm just curious.
[38:32.240 --> 38:34.600]  Now that we've gone through the whole game, do you still hold that opinion?
[38:35.520 --> 38:36.500]  I think I do.
[38:36.660 --> 38:37.280]  I think I do.
[38:37.640 --> 38:37.960]  Honestly.
[38:38.100 --> 38:39.020]  You're correct about that.
[38:39.100 --> 38:40.520]  That was my pick for a movie.
[38:40.740 --> 38:41.260]  Oh, wow, really?
[38:41.660 --> 38:42.760]  I love The Mummy.
[38:43.000 --> 38:43.140]  I thought it was Gavin.
[38:43.620 --> 38:45.580]  It's such a fun, as you said.
[38:45.820 --> 38:50.040]  I weirdly am not a big Indiana Jones guy, which you'd probably expect as a Mummy fan.
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.220]  As you said, Eric, kind of adjacent.
[38:53.400 --> 38:57.140]  Benny, is the answer you're looking for, Nick, for The Coward Across the River.
[38:57.540 --> 38:58.320]  Can't forget Benny.
[38:59.000 --> 39:00.180]  And everybody remembers that.
[39:00.180 --> 39:00.960]  They do.
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.160]  The next one was another movie I love, which is Mission Impossible 3.
[39:05.840 --> 39:07.260]  That's Jeff, isn't it?
[39:07.960 --> 39:10.980]  You said that that was Nobody.
[39:11.620 --> 39:12.000]  Cool.
[39:12.440 --> 39:13.620]  As well, Nick.
[39:13.740 --> 39:14.080]  All right.
[39:14.540 --> 39:14.780]  Yep.
[39:15.200 --> 39:15.700]  It's Jeff.
[39:16.200 --> 39:16.620]  Definitely.
[39:16.920 --> 39:17.020]  Damn.
[39:17.200 --> 39:17.740]  It has to be Jeff.
[39:17.740 --> 39:20.960]  I explained the entire fucking movie to you in 30 seconds.
[39:21.420 --> 39:22.260]  I gave you the highlights.
[39:22.760 --> 39:25.060]  It's the only thing I've ever heard him remember.
[39:25.880 --> 39:26.100]  Yeah.
[39:26.140 --> 39:29.160]  I think the fact that you didn't say Rabbit's Foot is the thing, though.
[39:29.160 --> 39:30.420]  I just couldn't remember that part.
[39:30.540 --> 39:31.300]  I couldn't remember that part.
[39:32.260 --> 39:32.940]  One thing.
[39:33.280 --> 39:37.020]  Yeah, when he didn't say Rabbit's Foot, I was like, oh, no.
[39:37.660 --> 39:38.020]  Yeah.
[39:38.220 --> 39:38.960]  Oh, man.
[39:39.680 --> 39:40.820]  Well, it was me.
[39:40.920 --> 39:41.460]  You fucked up.
[39:41.780 --> 39:42.980]  Well, I did fuck up.
[39:43.220 --> 39:48.500]  The next one was a movie I hate, which is Napoleon Dynamite, was the thing.
[39:48.900 --> 39:50.780]  You said that it was Eric.
[39:51.940 --> 39:53.340]  You were correct on that.
[39:54.320 --> 39:55.220]  I'm so stoked.
[39:55.300 --> 39:56.580]  I didn't know you hated that movie, too.
[39:56.600 --> 39:57.260]  This is awesome.
[39:57.560 --> 39:58.080]  Fucking suck.
[39:58.080 --> 39:59.160]  Yeah, it's a terrible film.
[39:59.440 --> 40:01.980]  Fuck, I hate that movie so much.
[40:02.100 --> 40:03.660]  It sucks shit.
[40:04.180 --> 40:05.520]  Nothing redeemable in that film.
[40:05.940 --> 40:06.180]  No.
[40:06.440 --> 40:06.600]  Yep.
[40:07.340 --> 40:11.700]  The next was Armageddon as a movie that I hate.
[40:17.980 --> 40:20.540]  Nick, you said that that was Nobody, I believe.
[40:20.960 --> 40:22.520]  What was your locked in on that one?
[40:23.060 --> 40:26.060]  Oh, at this point, man, it's all just up in the air.
[40:26.520 --> 40:26.960]  Nobody.
[40:27.860 --> 40:29.580]  Thank you for not writing it down, Andrew.
[40:29.720 --> 40:29.960]  This rocks.
[40:29.960 --> 40:30.280]  No, I did.
[40:30.720 --> 40:31.560]  No, I wrote it down.
[40:31.640 --> 40:31.920]  What?
[40:32.300 --> 40:34.760]  I just, uh, I was just seeing if he remembered.
[40:35.440 --> 40:35.680]  Nobody.
[40:36.840 --> 40:37.680]  You were wrong, Nick.
[40:38.100 --> 40:38.940]  It was, it was Jeff.
[40:39.400 --> 40:40.340]  It's definitely Jeff.
[40:40.920 --> 40:41.080]  Yeah.
[40:41.620 --> 40:42.980]  Jeff, I'm sorry.
[40:43.320 --> 40:43.480]  That's okay.
[40:43.580 --> 40:44.340]  I was honest with you.
[40:44.460 --> 40:45.160]  I tried to connect you.
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.580]  I tried to tell you, but like, buddy, you gotta pick it.
[40:48.040 --> 40:48.960]  Was it really bad?
[40:49.060 --> 40:50.760]  Like being in the army when that movie came out?
[40:50.800 --> 40:51.540]  Did it fucking suck?
[40:52.020 --> 40:54.220]  Yeah, it fucking just in every way.
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.480]  I hated that film.
[40:55.960 --> 40:56.640]  I was serious.
[40:56.700 --> 40:58.180]  I said, I like Deep Impact better.
[40:58.260 --> 40:59.940]  I thought it was a way version of that story.
[40:59.940 --> 41:01.920]  I just, ugh, fucking, it was gross.
[41:02.900 --> 41:03.740]  Deep Impact was better.
[41:04.420 --> 41:08.220]  The next was, loved song, Madonna.
[41:08.360 --> 41:08.800]  Oh, God.
[41:09.300 --> 41:09.840]  Oh, God.
[41:10.100 --> 41:10.980]  You said it was Jeff.
[41:11.860 --> 41:12.840]  I'm going to be wrong, aren't I?
[41:12.860 --> 41:13.960]  You didn't, did you say it was me?
[41:14.500 --> 41:14.980]  Did he not?
[41:15.740 --> 41:16.220]  Did it, what?
[41:16.660 --> 41:17.720]  That's how I have it for scoring.
[41:18.180 --> 41:19.360]  I don't remember him saying that.
[41:19.420 --> 41:20.640]  I remember him saying it was neither of us.
[41:21.300 --> 41:22.200]  Oh, I thought I said it was you.
[41:22.280 --> 41:22.880]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[41:23.440 --> 41:23.900]  Maybe you did.
[41:23.900 --> 41:24.520]  I wrote it down.
[41:24.660 --> 41:24.760]  You did.
[41:24.960 --> 41:25.580]  You wrote it down.
[41:25.620 --> 41:26.200]  Yeah, I said Jeff.
[41:26.280 --> 41:26.560]  That's right.
[41:26.620 --> 41:27.340]  I absolutely said Jeff.
[41:27.420 --> 41:27.600]  Okay.
[41:28.460 --> 41:29.740]  Because you were very emphatic about it.
[41:29.740 --> 41:34.020]  I'm starting to think that Nick said me, actually.
[41:34.440 --> 41:36.460]  I'm starting to think that you should shut the fuck up.
[41:37.880 --> 41:39.460]  Nick and Jeff, you get a point.
[41:39.580 --> 41:42.360]  It was Jeff as all Madonna.
[41:42.980 --> 41:43.280]  Crazy.
[41:43.540 --> 41:44.240]  I had no idea.
[41:44.420 --> 41:44.880]  That's crazy.
[41:45.360 --> 41:45.840]  I love Madonna.
[41:46.060 --> 41:47.640]  I think her first album is so fucking good.
[41:48.280 --> 41:48.680]  I agree.
[41:48.920 --> 41:50.880]  Eric gave you a run for your money there, though.
[41:50.920 --> 41:51.440]  Holy shit.
[41:51.840 --> 41:53.640]  Oh, yeah, that was a great run by you, Eric.
[41:53.640 --> 41:56.620]  I really like Madonna through like that early.
[41:56.780 --> 42:00.580]  That VH1 era of Madonna is fucking brutal.
[42:01.120 --> 42:03.380]  But like she did that Austin Powers song.
[42:03.620 --> 42:06.600]  And it's like that's kind of like the last time you could probably listen to Madonna
[42:06.600 --> 42:07.580]  and be like, this is pretty good.
[42:07.920 --> 42:11.100]  I wouldn't have told beat off stories if it wasn't true.
[42:11.820 --> 42:13.180]  Well, now here's the thing.
[42:13.200 --> 42:14.480]  I don't agree with that.
[42:15.160 --> 42:16.000]  I don't think I would.
[42:16.320 --> 42:16.920]  I think that's a lie.
[42:17.000 --> 42:17.720]  Give me a point.
[42:17.720 --> 42:18.360]  I think.
[42:21.660 --> 42:23.560]  The next was hated song.
[42:24.140 --> 42:25.300]  Hurt so good.
[42:26.480 --> 42:28.180]  Nick, you said that that was Eric.
[42:28.940 --> 42:29.420]  I did.
[42:29.860 --> 42:30.840]  You are incorrect.
[42:31.180 --> 42:33.600]  That is a point for Eric and only Eric.
[42:33.920 --> 42:34.740]  That was mine.
[42:35.100 --> 42:36.060]  I fucking hate hurt so good.
[42:36.060 --> 42:36.900]  I didn't feel like Eric at all.
[42:37.300 --> 42:38.260]  No, I like that song.
[42:38.760 --> 42:39.020]  I can't stand it.
[42:39.180 --> 42:40.360]  Oh, I hate it so much.
[42:40.360 --> 42:41.320]  I think I think that song.
[42:41.400 --> 42:42.620]  I think that song is totally fine.
[42:42.740 --> 42:44.600]  I also think that's when he's John Mellencamp.
[42:44.700 --> 42:46.160]  I don't even think he's John Cougar at that point.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.040]  I think he's just John Mellencamp.
[42:47.040 --> 42:48.180]  He rotates around.
[42:48.340 --> 42:51.100]  I just I hate everything about John Mellencamp.
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.080]  Can't stand him.
[42:52.380 --> 42:53.400]  I think he's so cringy.
[42:54.080 --> 42:54.660]  Don't like.
[42:54.780 --> 42:55.120]  Is he Canadian?
[42:55.740 --> 42:56.600]  I don't think so.
[42:56.720 --> 42:57.600]  I think he's from Indiana.
[42:58.100 --> 42:59.100]  Oh yeah, you're right.
[42:59.140 --> 42:59.500]  He is.
[42:59.620 --> 43:00.180]  He's from Indiana.
[43:00.560 --> 43:00.820]  All right.
[43:01.220 --> 43:04.380]  The next one is love TV show friends.
[43:04.820 --> 43:05.600]  Oh God.
[43:06.260 --> 43:07.820]  Nick, you picked Eric.
[43:08.600 --> 43:09.220]  I'm wrong.
[43:10.160 --> 43:10.940]  You both get a point.
[43:11.300 --> 43:11.720]  You're correct.
[43:12.120 --> 43:14.140]  Oh my God.
[43:14.380 --> 43:16.240]  Yeah, I it's it's like.
[43:16.240 --> 43:17.920]  I can list Sopranos and all this stuff.
[43:18.080 --> 43:19.860]  It is in my heart of hearts.
[43:19.900 --> 43:20.580]  I know what it is.
[43:21.120 --> 43:23.100]  And then the last one asked hated show.
[43:23.560 --> 43:24.620]  I appreciate your honesty.
[43:25.160 --> 43:25.920]  You said Jeff.
[43:27.860 --> 43:28.660]  That Andrew.
[43:29.100 --> 43:30.340]  That's so funny.
[43:30.600 --> 43:31.560]  Back to back.
[43:31.880 --> 43:33.020]  That's such a funny.
[43:33.340 --> 43:34.360]  I had to do it.
[43:34.940 --> 43:35.720]  That's so good.
[43:35.900 --> 43:36.160]  Twice.
[43:36.320 --> 43:36.680]  It's great.
[43:36.820 --> 43:37.860]  It's so funny.
[43:37.980 --> 43:39.180]  I hope you do it to some other people.
[43:42.100 --> 43:42.960]  I want it.
[43:43.020 --> 43:43.800]  Well, you were right.
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.040]  First of all, it was Jeff's list of hated show.
[43:46.240 --> 43:50.620]  I thought it was funny that you guys had a show that was your favorite and hated.
[43:50.860 --> 43:52.320]  I thought that was great.
[43:52.700 --> 43:58.600]  I also wanted to like create a problem in the strategy you used, Eric, of posting the cassette
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.120]  where that really helps if there's nobody else that lists that they hate it.
[44:03.120 --> 44:05.820]  It then becomes your proof is difficult evidence.
[44:06.060 --> 44:06.260]  Yeah.
[44:06.400 --> 44:08.080]  So to add to total up the game.
[44:09.040 --> 44:12.380]  Nick, you ended up scoring, I believe, five points.
[44:13.040 --> 44:13.780]  Hell yeah.
[44:14.160 --> 44:15.440]  Eric scored three points.
[44:15.440 --> 44:16.080]  Nice.
[44:16.260 --> 44:17.460]  Jeff scored two points.
[44:18.360 --> 44:18.760]  Wow.
[44:19.100 --> 44:20.400]  And two points went to no one.
[44:20.500 --> 44:20.940]  They were wasted.
[44:21.080 --> 44:21.180]  Nice.
[44:21.240 --> 44:21.800]  Great job, fellas.
[44:21.880 --> 44:22.420]  Trash pile.
[44:23.160 --> 44:23.640]  Feels good.
[44:24.060 --> 44:24.620]  Feels good.
[44:24.800 --> 44:25.680]  Trash points.
[44:25.920 --> 44:27.280]  I got to find that Friends cassette again.
[44:27.380 --> 44:31.780]  It has clips from the show where it's like some talking parts and stuff from like early seasons.
[44:33.780 --> 44:35.520]  Yeah, I got to find that again, man.
[44:35.520 --> 44:36.060]  It's pretty good.
[44:36.660 --> 44:38.100]  It's got Hootie and the Blowfish on it.
[44:38.540 --> 44:39.940]  Yeah, but you don't like cassettes, remember?
[44:40.080 --> 44:40.920]  You went on a whole tour.
[44:41.100 --> 44:42.960]  I definitely don't like cassettes.
[44:43.100 --> 44:43.300]  I got...
[44:43.300 --> 44:44.080]  No, that's why I'm just gonna...
[44:44.080 --> 44:45.820]  I'm gonna see if I can find it on like Apple Music.
[44:46.240 --> 44:47.600]  I'm not gonna buy them.
[44:47.700 --> 44:49.020]  I'm not gonna actually get the cassette.
[44:49.220 --> 44:51.360]  It's just the idea of the music I got to get.
[44:53.280 --> 44:54.140]  Cassettes are terrible.
[44:54.520 --> 44:57.320]  We conclude the first episode of Who Are You?
[44:57.380 --> 45:02.220]  We'll be back with another one with different people, different positions, different questions
[45:02.220 --> 45:02.740]  potentially.
[45:03.540 --> 45:04.400]  That was a lot of fun.
[45:04.780 --> 45:05.980]  I'm glad we did this.
[45:06.140 --> 45:09.920]  I'm gonna like think about it, maybe adjust a few things for next time.
[45:09.920 --> 45:14.500]  I think when we do it, when there's all five of us, it could be a fun thing where like you
[45:14.500 --> 45:18.240]  could ask the person who's listening on the side if they have an opinion.
[45:18.600 --> 45:19.380]  I don't know, a lot of elements.
[45:19.380 --> 45:20.180]  It could be like a phone-a-friend.
[45:20.340 --> 45:21.960]  Yeah, like a phone-a-friend type thing.
[45:22.360 --> 45:23.480]  Yeah, I like that.
[45:23.580 --> 45:29.300]  But until then, let me know how you did in the comments of you guessing who was telling
[45:29.300 --> 45:31.500]  the truth and who was lying and all that, how your score was.
[45:31.660 --> 45:33.280]  I'd be fascinated to know that.
[45:33.740 --> 45:34.400]  Make sure you check out...
[45:34.400 --> 45:34.840]  I nailed it!
[45:34.920 --> 45:35.760]  You did really good, Vint.
[45:35.860 --> 45:36.280]  You did great.
[45:36.320 --> 45:36.800]  For the most part.
[45:37.320 --> 45:37.800]  Thank you!
