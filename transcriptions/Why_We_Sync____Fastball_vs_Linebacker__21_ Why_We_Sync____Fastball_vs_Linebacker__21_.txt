[00:26.120 --> 00:29.320]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:29.320 --> 00:36.860]  This is number 21, our 146th, 47th episode or so, 200.
[00:37.260 --> 00:42.720]  And my name is Jeff, and also I got Eric and Gavin and Nick and Andrew.
[00:42.880 --> 00:43.860]  Let's talk to Andrew real fast.
[00:43.920 --> 00:47.480]  So straight away, we should point out, this is the second recording.
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.720]  We stopped recording about a minute ago.
[00:49.760 --> 00:50.780]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:50.940 --> 00:52.900]  We stopped recording about a minute ago.
[00:53.060 --> 00:55.200]  Andrew stopped recording about two minutes ago,
[00:55.280 --> 00:58.300]  then started recording again two seconds later.
[00:58.300 --> 01:04.020]  So, Andrew, without anyone explaining it to you, why do you think we do a sync?
[01:04.480 --> 01:07.780]  We sync because he's going to lay down all of the tracks
[01:07.780 --> 01:11.820]  and then play them simultaneously and having us all count,
[01:11.920 --> 01:16.040]  he'll be able to figure out like the timing of it to get us all aligned.
[01:16.400 --> 01:17.040]  Let me ask you this.
[01:17.360 --> 01:21.380]  Yeah. What is Nick going to do with a 20 second chunk
[01:21.970 --> 01:24.300]  at the end of your file that's just a sync?
[01:24.840 --> 01:27.360]  Well, it's the same file.
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.120]  There's just a little detour.
[01:30.100 --> 01:33.280]  So it's not even a new track. It's on your existing track.
[01:33.600 --> 01:34.660]  It's on my existing track.
[01:34.760 --> 01:37.160]  So what does that mean for your sync?
[01:38.720 --> 01:40.660]  Well, at the end, we're all counting again.
[01:41.220 --> 01:44.080]  No, at the end, all four of us are counting again.
[01:44.440 --> 01:46.400]  You're counting before we start counting.
[01:46.680 --> 01:49.220]  If you stopped and started, your sync happened sooner.
[01:49.880 --> 01:50.580]  OK, wait a second.
[01:50.760 --> 01:53.120]  Let me let me figure this out for a second.
[01:53.560 --> 01:54.540]  I think I'm getting along.
[01:54.680 --> 01:57.140]  So if Nick were to sync, we're to sync.
[01:57.140 --> 01:58.860]  We're to in-sync to you.
[01:59.540 --> 02:00.460]  Let me let me get there.
[02:00.580 --> 02:02.740]  I got to get there myself or this is going to be pointless.
[02:03.760 --> 02:08.020]  So you do the back sync to see if we have gotten out of sync,
[02:08.100 --> 02:10.340]  I'm assuming, by the end?
[02:10.800 --> 02:11.960]  Yeah. OK.
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.340]  Yeah, in case it's like someone's drifting.
[02:13.940 --> 02:15.360]  We got it. OK, well, then, yeah.
[02:15.400 --> 02:17.200]  Then what I did would be completely useless.
[02:17.400 --> 02:18.300]  I just panicked.
[02:19.400 --> 02:21.660]  I don't typically...
[02:21.660 --> 02:23.520]  Technically, it could be more than useless.
[02:24.160 --> 02:25.460]  It could be super counterproductive.
[02:25.460 --> 02:27.780]  It would be absolutely detrimental to the recording.
[02:27.920 --> 02:30.780]  But I did not expect Andrew going, ah, yes.
[02:31.700 --> 02:32.760]  That was an immediate fold.
[02:33.140 --> 02:35.500]  But it is worse than not doing a sync.
[02:35.820 --> 02:36.700]  I just want to point that out.
[02:36.920 --> 02:38.660]  Well, now I know that. I didn't know that before.
[02:38.880 --> 02:42.600]  We just recently got into syncing on audio in that way.
[02:42.740 --> 02:45.480]  We have gone 200 something episodes.
[02:45.620 --> 02:47.520]  No, no, no, no, no. Hang on. Hang on. He's right.
[02:48.300 --> 02:50.180]  Right. We started syncing for the podcast.
[02:50.360 --> 02:53.780]  I'm asking about a sync in general, which we've been doing for a very long time
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.000]  for our video game videos.
[02:55.520 --> 02:56.940]  Yeah, but not not the podcast.
[02:57.100 --> 02:58.060]  Do you think that's different?
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.800]  No, it's just like in my head, it is different.
[03:00.900 --> 03:02.980]  Like we're doing a podcast. We're not doing a let's play.
[03:03.460 --> 03:04.840]  I've worked in my head and let's play.
[03:04.940 --> 03:06.720]  There will be a front sync and an end sync.
[03:06.840 --> 03:09.980]  And this is what the ritual is as opposed to a podcast.
[03:10.480 --> 03:11.780]  My ritual is different.
[03:12.160 --> 03:16.960]  Right. I'm not I'm not faulting you for stopping at the end.
[03:17.240 --> 03:18.340]  That's not what I'm saying.
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.640]  You just called it a ritual to do a front sync and a back sync in the gameplay.
[03:23.640 --> 03:26.440]  You understand what I'm saying is you understand there's a reason.
[03:27.020 --> 03:27.820]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:28.160 --> 03:30.980]  Like it's the same. It's the exact same purpose.
[03:30.980 --> 03:34.860]  I'm just saying that like I have a habit I've established in my head of like
[03:34.860 --> 03:36.860]  I'm doing a let's play. It's going to begin this way.
[03:36.920 --> 03:37.820]  It's going to end this way.
[03:38.020 --> 03:39.800]  And that's how it's going to go every time.
[03:40.040 --> 03:42.940]  And the podcast, we've done like 200 of them
[03:42.940 --> 03:45.280]  where that was not a thing we did at the end.
[03:45.440 --> 03:47.380]  It is a relatively recent thing.
[03:47.420 --> 03:51.800]  Again, I don't think I don't think anybody's faulting you for not doing the tail
[03:51.800 --> 03:55.240]  sync. It is the understanding of why we sync is was.
[03:55.440 --> 03:57.060]  That that's what I was curious about.
[03:57.160 --> 04:00.780]  I think it was more just funny the way you addressed it when you said,
[04:00.960 --> 04:03.260]  Oh, I stopped recording. No worries, I hit recording again.
[04:03.260 --> 04:05.380]  Don't worry, don't worry about it.
[04:05.760 --> 04:06.620]  Problem solved.
[04:06.980 --> 04:09.560]  That was it was just you're you're sure.
[04:09.720 --> 04:13.380]  Yes. How sure you were that you had remedied the situation,
[04:13.380 --> 04:15.920]  which was so caught us off guard, I think.
[04:16.100 --> 04:20.980]  Yeah, it was like if I knocked a vase over or something of glass
[04:20.980 --> 04:25.300]  and then quickly grabbed all the pieces and said, Don't worry, I got them all.
[04:25.440 --> 04:29.300]  Like, yeah, it's not the situation is not resolved.
[04:29.480 --> 04:30.440]  It was just more.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.860]  I realized I had made my mistake because I'm so like instinctually.
[04:34.880 --> 04:35.720]  It's like, OK, we're done.
[04:35.780 --> 04:40.320]  I hit stop as soon as the show is over and I need to not do that.
[04:40.720 --> 04:43.460]  And I did that and went, Oh, no, I fucked up.
[04:44.200 --> 04:47.560]  I'm going to hit the record button again to try to reverse this.
[04:47.700 --> 04:49.760]  But now I know it's just gone.
[04:49.760 --> 04:52.360]  I would say it was more equivalent to you knocking over a vase
[04:52.360 --> 04:54.600]  and then quickly throwing a different vase at it.
[04:58.680 --> 05:00.360]  Try putting them both together, idiot.
[05:01.800 --> 05:04.520]  To your to your point, though, Andrew, I have the same problem
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.400]  where I'm a creature of habit as well, and I almost hit
[05:08.400 --> 05:11.620]  stop recording almost every time we have to do a tail sync for the podcast.
[05:11.740 --> 05:12.520]  Now, I'm not used to it either.
[05:13.060 --> 05:15.760]  We haven't explained how we actually think, but I don't know if people know,
[05:15.780 --> 05:18.920]  but we usually we have everyone mute except for one person
[05:18.920 --> 05:20.600]  and they count backwards from five.
[05:20.740 --> 05:22.680]  And when you kind of we all join in at three.
[05:22.940 --> 05:25.180]  So we all end up saying three, two, one at the same time.
[05:25.320 --> 05:28.420]  Except usually I would say like eight out of every ten times
[05:28.420 --> 05:31.520]  when we all unmute, somebody goes, I'm sorry, I came back in at one.
[05:32.980 --> 05:36.260]  It also works super well for the four of us that are in Texas.
[05:36.260 --> 05:40.080]  But with Andrew, we're dealing with the speed of light.
[05:40.140 --> 05:44.400]  Yeah, there's there's a bit there's also there's also a thing that has occurred
[05:44.400 --> 05:49.080]  where the countdown kind of goes like five, four.
[05:51.200 --> 05:55.760]  Three, two, one, and that will sort of throw everything into chaos.
[05:56.000 --> 06:01.380]  I am I have real performance anxiety for the count and I fuck it up.
[06:01.500 --> 06:03.280]  I feel like every time I have to do the count,
[06:03.720 --> 06:06.300]  like I get it in my head about it, I can't keep a cadence.
[06:06.700 --> 06:08.580]  I'm definitely guilty of making that problem.
[06:09.080 --> 06:12.660]  It is the problem for me of when someone else is doing the count of, OK,
[06:12.680 --> 06:13.520]  we're going to do the count.
[06:13.520 --> 06:19.420]  And then my brain will wander immediately because I'm muted and it's like I shut off
[06:19.420 --> 06:23.840]  and then I'll wake up unless I constantly yell in my own head.
[06:24.000 --> 06:26.360]  You got to focus on the count, focus on the count, focus on the count.
[06:26.640 --> 06:32.080]  Otherwise, I will drift instantly to something else and then panic on like two.
[06:32.520 --> 06:33.460]  It is a problem.
[06:33.780 --> 06:39.580]  Maybe what we should do is we'll have Eric stream some Formula One starting lights.
[06:44.320 --> 06:48.740]  I think I think what we have to do is just put like,
[06:49.360 --> 06:52.440]  I think we just have to get like one of those coin dash runner games
[06:52.440 --> 06:56.680]  so Andrew can like pay attention to something while we all mute everything.
[06:56.900 --> 06:57.840]  Like it's a tick tock.
[06:58.220 --> 07:02.780]  Like, Andrew, if I just throw if if that's on the screen where it's running.
[07:03.100 --> 07:05.900]  Oh, no, I'm never going to hit that count.
[07:06.020 --> 07:07.620]  I'm going to be all in on those coins.
[07:07.740 --> 07:10.920]  I thought maybe I thought maybe you would keep your focus just enough.
[07:11.040 --> 07:13.020]  But OK, that was a tempo run.
[07:13.020 --> 07:14.660]  I played the shit out of that game. Yeah.
[07:15.900 --> 07:21.440]  I, uh, I had that exact same thing happen recently in a different way of
[07:21.440 --> 07:26.020]  like I get distracted and oh man, it was dumb.
[07:26.500 --> 07:27.640]  I was playing.
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.060]  It's one of the dumbest moments I've had in a while.
[07:31.120 --> 07:34.120]  I was playing this app.
[07:34.480 --> 07:39.260]  It's like a guess the jingle game with my partner and it like plays a jingle thing.
[07:39.620 --> 07:42.140]  And it was a voice going, ho, ho, ho.
[07:42.540 --> 07:44.300]  And we're like, what the fuck is that?
[07:44.480 --> 07:49.020]  Like what? What Santa branded thing is this?
[07:49.140 --> 07:51.880]  And in the game, you can get like coins every time you beat a level,
[07:51.920 --> 07:55.400]  you get some coins and you can spend the coins to see the brand logo
[07:55.820 --> 07:57.780]  of the thing that you're hearing.
[07:57.900 --> 07:58.800]  So I did that.
[07:59.100 --> 08:00.940]  And it was the Jolly Green Giant, which I didn't know.
[08:01.060 --> 08:03.120]  He went, ho, ho, ho. I had no idea.
[08:03.200 --> 08:04.080]  Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant.
[08:04.860 --> 08:06.360]  What he says. I didn't know that.
[08:06.660 --> 08:09.020]  So I thought I need to find an ad.
[08:09.100 --> 08:10.240]  Like, I need to see this.
[08:10.280 --> 08:11.780]  What's the context of this ad?
[08:11.780 --> 08:12.860]  So I open up YouTube.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.440]  I type in Jolly Green Giant ad or and I sort through
[08:17.440 --> 08:18.980]  and I find like a more recent one.
[08:19.040 --> 08:19.940]  I hit play.
[08:20.080 --> 08:22.500]  And then, you know, only like open a video on YouTube on the bottom.
[08:22.760 --> 08:24.340]  Comments like pop up for it.
[08:24.640 --> 08:25.820]  It was like comments.
[08:26.100 --> 08:30.560]  And it said who else is here because of and it was like some YouTuber or whatever.
[08:30.940 --> 08:34.840]  And I looked at that and I said, what the like, who the fuck is that?
[08:34.900 --> 08:35.700]  Is where my brain went.
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.660]  And then it went to an ad and I I hit skip ad.
[08:39.660 --> 08:41.500]  And then the ad for the
[08:41.500 --> 08:44.760]  the ad for the Jolly Green Giant thing started.
[08:44.940 --> 08:47.300]  And I forgot what I was doing.
[08:47.440 --> 08:49.940]  And I said, what the fuck is this?
[08:50.040 --> 08:51.880]  I said, I hit skip ad.
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.320]  You can't take me to another ad when I hit skip ad.
[08:55.500 --> 08:57.680]  I was outraged in my head.
[08:57.740 --> 09:00.500]  And the matter of these three seconds, I was convinced that YouTube
[09:00.500 --> 09:01.980]  had changed their entire system.
[09:02.120 --> 09:05.660]  And now skip ad meant skip that ad and not go to the content.
[09:06.200 --> 09:09.220]  And then my partner said, that's the ad you you search for.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.880]  We're watching what you want.
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.460]  I was so angry.
[09:15.760 --> 09:16.640]  Dude, wow.
[09:17.200 --> 09:19.100]  You're you're a creature of habit. I love it.
[09:19.500 --> 09:20.460]  I just I was gone.
[09:20.620 --> 09:22.600]  I was lost in the thing.
[09:22.660 --> 09:26.380]  I've never been so upset and then realized I was so wrong so quickly.
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.560]  I rate I was so mad about that fucking Jolly Green Giant ad.
[09:31.280 --> 09:32.600]  Pay no attention to me in the chat.
[09:32.660 --> 09:34.560]  I'm just putting images of Jolly Green Giants.
[09:34.700 --> 09:36.500]  You're so excited about these two.
[09:36.600 --> 09:39.580]  I feel like you found this one and you went, oh, we got this.
[09:39.580 --> 09:41.860]  Baby, I'm just looking for making thumbnails.
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.220]  You just dropped one in this coolest homemade costumes dot com.
[09:49.800 --> 09:52.480]  That is not the coolest homemade costume.
[09:53.220 --> 09:57.840]  Have you seen all the different variations through time of the Jolly Green Giant?
[09:57.960 --> 09:58.940]  Have you ever looked at that?
[09:59.600 --> 10:02.200]  I was looking for the one that was like the dude.
[10:02.360 --> 10:03.480]  Let me. Green.
[10:03.880 --> 10:07.100]  Let me post it and we can go through and talk about the years of the giant.
[10:08.020 --> 10:11.180]  There are some evolutions that I've certainly have never seen before.
[10:11.480 --> 10:12.680]  Whoa, he didn't used to be green?
[10:12.860 --> 10:15.640]  What? He started out as just a normal giant.
[10:16.340 --> 10:17.560]  He just ate too many peas.
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.760]  He really liked peas in 1928.
[10:21.380 --> 10:24.840]  Then in 1930, he ate too many peas and he turned green.
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.580]  He was the exact same dude, just fully green, including his clothes.
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.780]  I wonder if they just sent the first picture, the 1928 version, to like a different company to update it,
[10:34.820 --> 10:36.080]  but it came through as black and white.
[10:36.080 --> 10:37.880]  And they just thought he was all green.
[10:38.420 --> 10:42.500]  Or maybe they were like, we're paying too much money screen printing all these extra colors.
[10:42.640 --> 10:45.500]  Let's just make it green. The peas are green. It's fucking one color.
[10:46.900 --> 10:51.860]  Then they completely redesigned him into sort of what you know today in 1936.
[10:51.980 --> 10:55.140]  But he was all about corn then. I guess it was a big year for corn.
[10:55.900 --> 11:02.500]  Then he goes in 1945, he gets married and has corn and peas.
[11:03.640 --> 11:04.340]  He's way bigger.
[11:04.340 --> 11:05.740]  That's bizarre.
[11:06.460 --> 11:08.340]  It's probably how Shaq feels.
[11:08.740 --> 11:09.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[11:11.020 --> 11:11.580]  100%.
[11:11.580 --> 11:14.240]  I like that in 1980 he got cold.
[11:14.940 --> 11:21.000]  He did. I like that in 1948, clearly his marriage went to shit and he just had a weird phase.
[11:21.140 --> 11:22.620]  He was just trying to find himself again.
[11:23.040 --> 11:24.560]  Yeah, he's like a bluey gray.
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.400]  This is midlife crisis.
[11:26.900 --> 11:29.220]  Yeah. 1950 peas.
[11:29.220 --> 11:33.160]  Then 1960, I think they tried to get fun with it.
[11:33.200 --> 11:34.860]  He looks like a cartoon character.
[11:35.220 --> 11:36.940]  He looks like he belongs on the Flintstones.
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.980]  1970s, he looks like he's in an animated show that will teach you how to do math.
[11:43.700 --> 11:45.500]  It's very kid-centric.
[11:45.800 --> 11:48.240]  He got a scarf in the 80s. That's exciting.
[11:50.320 --> 11:51.060]  That's the evolution.
[11:51.580 --> 11:52.460]  They haven't really modernized him.
[11:52.460 --> 11:54.480]  He's spoiled in 1976, unfortunately.
[11:54.560 --> 11:55.300]  Yeah, he's gross.
[11:55.300 --> 12:00.360]  I think that his 1970 look is the best look in the whole thing.
[12:00.640 --> 12:01.040]  It's awesome.
[12:01.960 --> 12:03.260]  The rest of it is so weird.
[12:03.420 --> 12:06.840]  The 1961 looks like he's in a Superman pose and everything.
[12:06.960 --> 12:08.300]  I don't like that.
[12:08.560 --> 12:10.660]  The 1971 is very much like,
[12:11.340 --> 12:12.900]  oh, we're going in a direction here.
[12:13.080 --> 12:14.080]  And I think it was really smart.
[12:14.340 --> 12:16.340]  And then they just changed it back to grosser green.
[12:16.700 --> 12:17.720]  And then gave him a scarf.
[12:18.740 --> 12:23.560]  Jeff, you've been looking for things to fill some space up on your body for tattoos.
[12:23.560 --> 12:26.060]  Maybe go for every Jolly Green Giant.
[12:26.560 --> 12:27.940]  Oh, that's interesting.
[12:28.260 --> 12:29.760]  You know what I've got to get tattooed,
[12:29.800 --> 12:30.720]  now that I'm thinking about it.
[12:30.940 --> 12:33.940]  Eric and I are brainstorming some ideas
[12:33.940 --> 12:35.480]  on some tattoo-related content.
[12:35.800 --> 12:37.080]  I don't have a hot dog tattoo.
[12:37.580 --> 12:38.460]  Oh, you need that.
[12:38.900 --> 12:41.740]  And I don't want to beat this hot dog thing to death.
[12:41.800 --> 12:43.160]  I've already done, now,
[12:43.680 --> 12:46.080]  three hot dog episodes on Soul All Right.
[12:46.380 --> 12:47.400]  Oh my God.
[12:48.340 --> 12:50.440]  And then all the hot dog-related content here.
[12:50.520 --> 12:51.200]  But I've got to say,
[12:51.200 --> 12:53.360]  I have never...
[12:53.940 --> 12:55.000]  Practiced by Falcons,
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.900]  God bless the Cosmic Crisp Apple,
[12:57.040 --> 12:59.640]  who still shout us out all the time on social media, by the way.
[12:59.740 --> 13:00.480]  Love those guys to death.
[13:01.080 --> 13:02.520]  So many other popular things we've had.
[13:03.260 --> 13:10.240]  Nothing has captured the audience's fervent imagination and enthusiasm like Hot Dogs has.
[13:10.460 --> 13:11.280]  It's insane.
[13:11.780 --> 13:14.060]  Well, I'm glad that we went back on Hot Dogs.
[13:14.200 --> 13:16.100]  I wanted to address something with you
[13:16.100 --> 13:17.960]  that was hot dog-related, Jeff.
[13:18.480 --> 13:20.080]  Bring your spirits up a little bit.
[13:20.080 --> 13:21.920]  Because, you know, you just, in the last episode, talking about
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.440]  tough times at the dentist.
[13:24.720 --> 13:26.620]  You have been recently...
[13:26.620 --> 13:28.240]  You brought back your
[13:28.240 --> 13:29.940]  card-ripped packs.
[13:30.160 --> 13:31.960]  I fucking destroyed that.
[13:32.040 --> 13:33.100]  That was a terrible...
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.620]  It's not the break show, what do you call it?
[13:35.640 --> 13:36.280]  The Daily Rip.
[13:37.140 --> 13:39.480]  I brought it back briefly for like a mission.
[13:40.020 --> 13:41.300]  You did, yeah, because you were trying...
[13:41.300 --> 13:43.940]  There was a hot dog variant and a type of
[13:43.940 --> 13:45.740]  Tops Baseball Pack, I believe.
[13:46.200 --> 13:48.240]  Yeah, Tops Series...
[13:48.240 --> 13:50.300]  Tops Series 2 Baseball has
[13:50.300 --> 13:52.220]  one of the different... They have like summer
[13:52.220 --> 13:54.220]  parallels and one of... Like at
[13:54.220 --> 13:56.340]  the Statue of Liberty fireworks, one of them
[13:56.340 --> 13:58.320]  was a hot dog. And when I found that
[13:58.320 --> 14:00.360]  out, I decided
[14:00.360 --> 14:02.200]  that I was going to open a pack a day
[14:02.200 --> 14:04.080]  until I got a hot dog parallel.
[14:04.640 --> 14:06.220]  And so I didn't tell you guys about it or anything.
[14:06.280 --> 14:08.480]  I was just doing it. No. Kind of for fun on the side.
[14:08.760 --> 14:10.300]  And on day five, I hit
[14:10.300 --> 14:12.540]  the hot dog parallel. I was very surprised by it.
[14:12.920 --> 14:14.140]  I was excitedly following
[14:14.140 --> 14:16.360]  all of the rips and you finally got it.
[14:16.360 --> 14:18.340]  And I don't think you fully, necessarily
[14:18.340 --> 14:20.580]  appreciated how great
[14:20.580 --> 14:21.920]  of a hot dog card you got.
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.420]  So I screen capped it because you didn't mention this
[14:24.420 --> 14:26.640]  at all in the moment. Maybe you have
[14:26.640 --> 14:27.880]  reflected since then.
[14:28.280 --> 14:30.440]  But your man, Matt
[14:30.440 --> 14:32.780]  Strom, that dude's eaten the dog.
[14:33.160 --> 14:34.520]  It's lined up perfectly
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.700]  with his mouth. He's chowing down
[14:36.700 --> 14:38.620]  on the dog. That has to
[14:38.620 --> 14:40.640]  be the best of the hot dog
[14:40.640 --> 14:42.500]  variants. I can't imagine
[14:42.500 --> 14:43.880]  any of them
[14:44.520 --> 14:46.340]  are lined up as good
[14:46.340 --> 14:47.780]  as that. It's incredible.
[14:48.340 --> 14:49.960]  He's just chowing down.
[14:50.200 --> 14:52.020]  I was just so blown away by
[14:52.020 --> 14:54.120]  getting it. I had fully anticipated
[14:54.120 --> 14:55.540]  this taking like 30 or 40
[14:55.540 --> 14:57.720]  packs. I
[14:58.540 --> 15:00.080]  hadn't seen it. I didn't even notice it
[15:00.080 --> 15:01.980]  until this moment. That is so awesome, Andrew.
[15:02.100 --> 15:03.240]  Thank you for pointing that out.
[15:05.320 --> 15:05.880]  He's just
[15:05.880 --> 15:07.040]  chowing down on the dog.
[15:08.280 --> 15:08.940]  He's Pac-Man.
[15:10.480 --> 15:12.020]  One of my friends, one of my old
[15:12.020 --> 15:14.020]  friends reached out to me the other day. He saw it and he said
[15:14.020 --> 15:16.020]  that that guy, Matt Strom, is a big card
[15:16.020 --> 15:17.960]  collector. I was just about to ask,
[15:18.040 --> 15:19.180]  do you know about The Card Life?
[15:19.640 --> 15:21.900]  I don't know about it, but my friend Kevin
[15:21.900 --> 15:22.720]  was telling me that he's
[15:23.540 --> 15:25.820]  real big into card collecting. He has a belt or something
[15:25.820 --> 15:27.800]  that he wears. He has a
[15:27.800 --> 15:29.900]  belt that he's
[15:29.900 --> 15:31.860]  all about this belt with cards and all
[15:31.860 --> 15:34.060]  this stuff. He has his own show called The Card Life
[15:34.060 --> 15:36.220]  where he's hosting a show dedicated
[15:36.220 --> 15:37.980]  to sports card collecting.
[15:38.840 --> 15:39.640]  Holy shit.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.800]  Yeah, he used to be a Padre
[15:41.800 --> 15:43.400]  and then we traded him away or whatever
[15:43.400 --> 15:45.480]  and then since he's been on, I guess the Phillies
[15:45.480 --> 15:47.780]  is like a relief guy, it's been working out
[15:47.780 --> 15:49.360]  but this is his thing.
[15:49.600 --> 15:51.640]  He is super deep in this thing.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.220]  So it's very, very cool.
[15:53.500 --> 15:55.580]  It's very, very cool. Interesting. I'm gonna
[15:55.580 --> 15:56.740]  watch his show.
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.620]  I learned something about baseball last
[15:59.620 --> 16:00.820]  night at baseball.
[16:02.200 --> 16:03.200]  What did you learn?
[16:03.300 --> 16:04.400]  What did you learn in baseball?
[16:05.040 --> 16:06.700]  The mound is an actual mound.
[16:08.300 --> 16:09.100]  It's actually
[16:09.100 --> 16:10.260]  a little bit higher up.
[16:10.420 --> 16:11.980]  I had no idea.
[16:12.860 --> 16:14.840]  That's cool. Is that the
[16:14.840 --> 16:15.580]  only thing you learned?
[16:17.340 --> 16:18.780]  It's probably the most obvious thing
[16:18.780 --> 16:20.340]  I learned. Why is it higher?
[16:21.000 --> 16:22.080]  Because it's called the mound.
[16:22.560 --> 16:24.320]  What's the point in throwing from a mound?
[16:25.000 --> 16:26.640]  I believe that it is
[16:26.640 --> 16:28.440]  to give the pitcher an advantage
[16:28.440 --> 16:30.460]  because when you're
[16:30.460 --> 16:32.640]  throwing, you get more distance
[16:32.640 --> 16:34.800]  when you're coming off the mound on that stretch
[16:34.800 --> 16:36.700]  like your front leg and you are
[16:36.700 --> 16:38.780]  coming down and forward and you
[16:38.780 --> 16:40.380]  can throw the ball faster.
[16:40.560 --> 16:42.780]  So if the mound is taller, do you throw it
[16:42.780 --> 16:44.780]  faster? I think that's
[16:45.460 --> 16:46.800]  probably... Yeah, you probably would
[16:46.800 --> 16:48.820]  be able to eke out a little bit. It'd be minuscule
[16:48.820 --> 16:50.820]  but yeah. I want to see some bigger
[16:50.820 --> 16:52.880]  mounds. A quick Google
[16:52.880 --> 16:54.800]  says the pitcher's man was raised to help
[16:54.800 --> 16:56.460]  players have a faster pitch
[16:56.460 --> 16:58.820]  to avoid requiring players to make
[16:58.820 --> 17:00.820]  a running start before throwing the ball
[17:00.820 --> 17:03.020]  or taking any other dramatic
[17:03.020 --> 17:05.100]  measures. Oh, I disagree. We need to take
[17:05.100 --> 17:07.060]  away the mound. I think that we need to
[17:07.060 --> 17:09.140]  start... I think we need to start doing running pitches.
[17:09.720 --> 17:11.100]  Just like cricket balls
[17:11.100 --> 17:13.140]  in baseball? Yeah. Now I want to see
[17:13.140 --> 17:14.520]  a game of cricket with two mounds.
[17:14.960 --> 17:16.660]  Can you imagine
[17:16.660 --> 17:18.860]  Shohei Otani running at you
[17:18.860 --> 17:20.960]  with a ball in his hand and then throwing it as
[17:20.960 --> 17:22.660]  hard as he can from a rod?
[17:23.120 --> 17:24.980]  102 right into the small of your back? Yeah.
[17:25.140 --> 17:26.500]  Oh my god.
[17:26.840 --> 17:28.900]  I think we got the plot of Happy Gilmore 3.
[17:29.540 --> 17:30.620]  It's locked in 2.
[17:30.620 --> 17:32.940]  It's the happy lead up to the pitch.
[17:33.260 --> 17:34.740]  We were talking last
[17:34.740 --> 17:36.680]  night about would you rather get
[17:36.680 --> 17:38.920]  hit by a fast
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.740]  ball or tackled by a linebacker
[17:41.720 --> 17:42.840]  and where everyone
[17:42.840 --> 17:43.680]  stood on that.
[17:44.920 --> 17:46.240]  There's a lot of layers.
[17:46.720 --> 17:48.340]  How fast is this ball going?
[17:49.380 --> 17:49.980]  Listen,
[17:51.100 --> 17:52.780]  if you're going to get tackled by an NFL
[17:52.780 --> 17:54.760]  linebacker, then I...
[17:54.760 --> 17:56.560]  we don't get to pick which one, but
[17:56.560 --> 17:57.940]  we can assume a certain
[17:57.940 --> 17:59.800]  size and power
[17:59.800 --> 18:02.120]  level, so I'm going to guess this ball has
[18:02.120 --> 18:03.700]  to be in the 90s.
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.880]  Maybe it's 92,
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.660]  maybe it's 101,
[18:08.060 --> 18:09.820]  maybe it's like Bobby Jenks throwing it, but
[18:09.820 --> 18:11.960]  it's gotta be in the
[18:11.960 --> 18:13.840]  90s somewhere. It's a fastball.
[18:13.980 --> 18:15.320]  It's gonna hurt.
[18:16.440 --> 18:17.940]  And getting hit by
[18:17.940 --> 18:19.920]  a lineman, are they landing on you?
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  What type of attack is it going through?
[18:22.680 --> 18:23.980]  Are you just getting bowled over?
[18:24.220 --> 18:26.060]  We determined that you can
[18:26.060 --> 18:27.980]  choose to be hit from
[18:27.980 --> 18:29.540]  a standing still position
[18:30.020 --> 18:31.900]  or hit while running, if you would prefer.
[18:32.380 --> 18:34.320]  That's an interesting... that in itself...
[18:34.320 --> 18:35.880]  I think being hit while in motion
[18:35.880 --> 18:38.100]  is the way to go. I think it helps disperse
[18:38.100 --> 18:40.560]  some of the force, but...
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.020]  Yeah, especially if you're going
[18:42.020 --> 18:43.920]  the opposite direction. You're going a
[18:43.920 --> 18:44.560]  different way.
[18:45.580 --> 18:47.940]  The jolt to your body being hit from a
[18:47.940 --> 18:50.000]  standing still position has got to be pretty damaging
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.100]  I would think. I think it has to be the lineman,
[18:52.200 --> 18:54.020]  right? Because there's no way
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.340]  a lineman isn't hitting you.
[18:56.720 --> 18:57.100]  I agree.
[18:58.060 --> 19:00.100]  You guys are nuts. All I think about is
[19:00.100 --> 19:01.960]  Johnny Knoxville dying
[19:02.720 --> 19:04.220]  when they take his
[19:04.220 --> 19:05.720]  head off. And it's just like, just hit me
[19:06.080 --> 19:08.200]  once, you turn your shoulder, you're hopefully
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.120]  getting into the back. It's gonna hurt so
[19:10.120 --> 19:11.120]  bad, but
[19:12.660 --> 19:14.340]  even with pads on and everything
[19:14.340 --> 19:15.820]  dude, like a linebacker is just gonna
[19:16.420 --> 19:18.340]  destroy you. Here's the thing, I was imagining
[19:18.340 --> 19:20.060]  if I had to stand and take something
[19:20.060 --> 19:22.200]  if it was a ball, I could put my hands
[19:22.200 --> 19:24.160]  over my face and it would just smash
[19:24.160 --> 19:26.280]  my hand. But if I put my
[19:26.280 --> 19:28.440]  hands over my face and get tackled by a guy
[19:28.440 --> 19:30.000]  it's gonna hurt either way.
[19:30.000 --> 19:30.480]  Broken arms.
[19:33.320 --> 19:34.320]  I don't have
[19:34.320 --> 19:36.360]  that much faith in my body. I don't want to end up
[19:36.360 --> 19:38.300]  like Mike Piazza
[19:38.300 --> 19:40.140]  you know? I don't want brain
[19:40.140 --> 19:41.980]  damage. I don't want to get
[19:41.980 --> 19:44.140]  I've seen dudes get broken bones from getting
[19:44.140 --> 19:45.980]  hit by fastballs. That's fucking
[19:45.980 --> 19:48.360]  You just said you don't want brain damage
[19:48.360 --> 19:50.260]  so you want to get hit
[19:50.260 --> 19:51.680]  by the linebacker?
[19:51.980 --> 19:54.340]  I just think one hit, it's gonna disperse
[19:54.340 --> 19:56.320]  through your body. Your whole body's gonna
[19:56.320 --> 19:57.760]  absorb the blow
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.560]  I think it's gonna hurt
[20:00.140 --> 20:02.200]  less longer than the intense
[20:02.200 --> 20:04.080]  pain of being hit 80 miles an hour
[20:04.080 --> 20:05.960]  on my shoulder or my elbow or wherever.
[20:06.440 --> 20:07.580]  I think you're crazy.
[20:07.840 --> 20:10.040]  I think you have it totally backwards.
[20:10.100 --> 20:11.300]  I agree with you, Geoff.
[20:11.840 --> 20:14.180]  I've gone back and forth on this. I think I'm now
[20:14.180 --> 20:16.280]  leaning towards the guy again. Really?
[20:17.040 --> 20:17.300]  Yeah.
[20:17.300 --> 20:19.300]  Cause that's something that actually
[20:19.300 --> 20:20.340]  happens normally.
[20:20.920 --> 20:23.300]  Yeah, I mean yeah. I mean we'd get destroyed
[20:23.300 --> 20:24.640]  I don't know if you've ever seen
[20:25.080 --> 20:27.000]  the great clip of one
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.200]  remember Pros vs. Joes
[20:29.200 --> 20:30.620]  on Spike where it was like
[20:31.100 --> 20:33.240]  athletes against normal dudes. There's a lineman
[20:33.240 --> 20:35.160]  one where it was like trying to
[20:35.160 --> 20:37.120]  block or maybe it was a tackle
[20:37.120 --> 20:39.180]  but there's one of a guy just getting
[20:39.180 --> 20:41.300]  fucking flung by an NFL
[20:41.300 --> 20:43.400]  player that is fantastic
[20:43.400 --> 20:45.200]  and I would rather do that
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.120]  than... I just feel like a baseball is gonna
[20:47.120 --> 20:49.080]  destroy everything it impacts
[20:49.080 --> 20:51.220]  where I'm gonna get fucked up by
[20:51.220 --> 20:52.560]  the lineman but I don't
[20:53.080 --> 20:54.720]  it's not necessarily gonna break me.
[20:55.180 --> 20:57.100]  Somebody last night at the baseball game was
[20:57.100 --> 20:59.260]  telling us that their mom or their sister
[20:59.260 --> 21:01.240]  or somebody still has a scar
[21:01.240 --> 21:03.060]  from where she got hit with a baseball like
[21:03.060 --> 21:04.060]  30 years ago.
[21:04.580 --> 21:07.160]  I think maybe
[21:07.160 --> 21:08.260]  I don't know who it was but anyway
[21:08.260 --> 21:10.480]  I just... yeah I don't know man.
[21:11.040 --> 21:12.620]  Eric, you also said you had a dented
[21:12.620 --> 21:14.580]  leg or something. Yeah, I got
[21:14.580 --> 21:16.560]  hit with a baseball in the shin
[21:16.560 --> 21:18.740]  but that's in the shin. I just don't think
[21:18.740 --> 21:20.620]  that getting hit probably in the back
[21:20.620 --> 21:22.580]  by a fastball
[21:22.580 --> 21:24.720]  is something that happens all the
[21:24.720 --> 21:26.660]  time in baseball and nobody
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.900]  is going, we gotta figure out a solution
[21:28.900 --> 21:30.020]  for this where
[21:30.580 --> 21:32.300]  it happens all the time in football
[21:32.300 --> 21:34.260]  and they're making them wear new helmets.
[21:34.820 --> 21:36.420]  Like, they're constantly
[21:36.420 --> 21:38.560]  trying to fix it. Dude, dudes in baseball
[21:38.560 --> 21:40.680]  have fucking elbow guards, wrist
[21:40.680 --> 21:42.600]  guards, they've got guards going down halfway
[21:42.600 --> 21:43.580]  the size of their head.
[21:44.300 --> 21:46.580]  Those are all new solutions though
[21:46.580 --> 21:48.600]  that had to be put in place because of how dangerous
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.700]  it is. To blocking specific
[21:50.700 --> 21:52.760]  bone parts, but you block
[21:52.760 --> 21:54.760]  those bone parts and it's hitting you in the
[21:54.760 --> 21:56.180]  back, you're gonna be fine. I think
[21:56.180 --> 21:58.660]  you're gonna be fine compared to the linebacker. The linebacker
[21:58.660 --> 22:00.580]  is gonna fuck you up so bad. Like, if
[22:00.580 --> 22:02.600]  I was 21, I think I'd have a different
[22:02.600 --> 22:04.260]  answer. Here's what's gonna happen.
[22:04.660 --> 22:06.640]  It's gonna ping off your little elbow
[22:06.640 --> 22:08.400]  thing and it's gonna go right up
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.460]  under your neck and hit you
[22:10.460 --> 22:12.420]  in the throat and smash your Adam's apple
[22:12.420 --> 22:14.440]  and then you're gonna fucking choke to
[22:14.440 --> 22:16.440]  death on your own Adam's apple. It's gonna
[22:16.440 --> 22:18.000]  be some weird thing like that.
[22:18.160 --> 22:20.580]  It's dangerous the way those things ping off.
[22:20.820 --> 22:22.740]  I just... I don't know, man. I mean, compared to the linebacker
[22:22.740 --> 22:24.180]  that's very, very safe. Yeah, absolutely.
[22:24.300 --> 22:26.340]  But the linebacker, I feel like the transfer of energy
[22:26.340 --> 22:28.460]  is nicer. Like, if I jump at the last minute
[22:28.460 --> 22:30.400]  and I just go cartwheeling
[22:30.400 --> 22:32.340]  through the air, I'm not... it's not
[22:32.340 --> 22:33.660]  like a sudden deceleration.
[22:34.180 --> 22:36.360]  I also don't know that I'm gonna be
[22:36.360 --> 22:38.160]  able to react fast enough at
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.300]  49 years old to move, to
[22:40.300 --> 22:42.520]  put my back in play when somebody's
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.300]  throwing a ball 98 miles an hour at me.
[22:44.400 --> 22:46.340]  I might see it, recognize what's
[22:46.340 --> 22:47.860]  happening, and then my nose is gone.
[22:48.220 --> 22:50.320]  You know? Eric, if I post a video
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.240]  in the chat, could you screen share for like
[22:52.240 --> 22:54.220]  30 seconds? Is it the Johnny Knoxville
[22:54.220 --> 22:56.380]  blindside? No, no, it's not. It's the sports
[22:56.380 --> 22:58.340]  science thing I was talking about.
[22:58.340 --> 23:00.340]  Oh, hell yeah. Cool. 4 minutes, 15
[23:00.340 --> 23:02.300]  seconds in. And then you can...
[23:02.300 --> 23:04.200]  if you wanna type in on YouTube, sports science
[23:04.200 --> 23:06.320]  NFL defensive tackle, Chris Jenkins
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.700]  versus Average Joe.
[23:08.180 --> 23:09.820]  Yeah. Okay. Here we go.
[23:09.980 --> 23:12.320]  Pros versus Joes, but...
[23:12.320 --> 23:14.220]  I'm watching. Okay, I am
[23:14.220 --> 23:16.120]  loading into Eric's feed.
[23:16.980 --> 23:18.300]  Yeah, I can see it. Okay.
[23:18.620 --> 23:19.900]  We good? It's like a 10 second clip.
[23:19.960 --> 23:21.740]  Let's do this. So he's hitting play.
[23:22.600 --> 23:23.500]  They're lining up.
[23:26.120 --> 23:28.200]  I mean, I'd be terrified to just stare
[23:28.200 --> 23:29.340]  down. Oh!
[23:29.340 --> 23:30.600]  Oh my god!
[23:33.180 --> 23:34.760]  Look at him leave his feet!
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.120]  And then
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.120]  flung and lands way
[23:39.120 --> 23:41.420]  before the bag that is supposed to
[23:41.420 --> 23:41.980]  absorb the blood.
[23:43.540 --> 23:45.420]  Just instantly. Definitely taking
[23:45.420 --> 23:46.520]  that over a fastball.
[23:47.740 --> 23:49.200]  As bad as that looks. Okay,
[23:49.240 --> 23:51.360]  now we're going into the jackass one. Okay.
[23:52.460 --> 23:53.340]  Who is it? Jared
[23:53.340 --> 23:55.440]  something? I don't remember his name. He was on the Vikings
[23:55.440 --> 23:55.860]  forever.
[23:56.900 --> 23:58.460]  I 100%
[23:58.460 --> 23:59.280]  take that over.
[24:00.300 --> 24:02.080]  Like getting hit by a car.
[24:02.340 --> 24:03.980]  Like that fucking sucks.
[24:04.300 --> 24:05.500]  That's brutal.
[24:06.320 --> 24:06.920]  But...
[24:07.580 --> 24:09.940]  This is the reason that I'm
[24:09.940 --> 24:12.040]  picking baseball because of what
[24:12.040 --> 24:13.520]  happens immediately afterwards.
[24:13.900 --> 24:16.020]  This is the guy whose life is being a
[24:16.020 --> 24:18.240]  stuntman. You're doing...
[24:18.240 --> 24:20.080]  Either way, you're on the ground
[24:20.080 --> 24:20.780]  with that.
[24:21.040 --> 24:24.020]  Either scenario, that's you on the
[24:24.020 --> 24:25.560]  ground. Oh my god.
[24:26.440 --> 24:28.020]  Look at him just...
[24:31.140 --> 24:32.260]  Gets crunched.
[24:33.220 --> 24:34.080]  He's fine.
[24:34.600 --> 24:35.160]  Decimated.
[24:35.920 --> 24:36.480]  Decimated.
[24:37.300 --> 24:39.440]  I'd rather take that than the ball.
[24:39.500 --> 24:40.160]  You guys are crazy.
[24:41.300 --> 24:43.920]  I think I'd die. Yeah. With the ball.
[24:44.580 --> 24:45.880]  I don't like sharp pain.
[24:46.600 --> 24:47.780]  Like acute pain, you know?
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.940]  There's something about it being another
[24:49.940 --> 24:51.820]  human that makes it less intimidating
[24:51.820 --> 24:53.160]  to me than a ball.

[25:28.470 --> 25:30.670]  Put us in a box.
[25:31.810 --> 25:32.570]  Go ahead.
[25:33.010 --> 25:35.170]  That just gives us something to break
[25:35.170 --> 25:36.950]  out of. Because the next
[25:36.950 --> 25:38.490]  Generation 2025
[25:38.990 --> 25:40.810]  GMC Terrain Elevation is
[25:40.810 --> 25:43.010]  raising the standard of what comes
[25:43.010 --> 25:43.730]  standard.
[25:44.470 --> 25:46.370]  As far as expectations go,
[25:46.850 --> 25:48.870]  why meet them when you can
[25:48.870 --> 25:50.990]  shatter them? What we choose
[25:50.990 --> 25:53.190]  to challenge, we challenge completely.
[25:53.190 --> 25:55.530]  We are professional grade.
[25:55.690 --> 25:57.730]  Visit GMC.com to learn more.
[25:59.790 --> 26:01.530]  I know the math behind it doesn't
[26:01.530 --> 26:03.450]  make sense, but I'm not scared of
[26:03.450 --> 26:05.610]  a grape being dropped on me from the Empire
[26:05.610 --> 26:06.090]  State Building.
[26:07.170 --> 26:09.590]  A grape? Yeah, like something small
[26:09.590 --> 26:10.510]  and absorbable.
[26:12.210 --> 26:13.590]  Like a kiwi fruit.
[26:14.430 --> 26:15.490]  Like I know the velocity.
[26:15.490 --> 26:17.590]  A kiwi would be much worse than a grape.
[26:18.050 --> 26:19.090]  They're both small.
[26:19.290 --> 26:20.870]  Like in my head, it's no problem.
[26:21.410 --> 26:23.230]  I can catch a grape in my mouth
[26:23.230 --> 26:24.930]  from the Empire State. A kiwi would go
[26:24.930 --> 26:25.770]  through my face.
[26:26.570 --> 26:28.750]  I think they would both do a lot of damage
[26:28.750 --> 26:30.870]  realistically, but because it's so small...
[26:31.570 --> 26:32.050]  A grape?
[26:33.390 --> 26:34.970]  What's the terminal velocity of a
[26:34.970 --> 26:36.350]  grape? Like 20 miles an hour?
[26:36.770 --> 26:38.970]  Wait, does it max out?
[26:41.110 --> 26:41.910]  Well, yeah.
[26:43.610 --> 26:45.010]  What's the max speed of a
[26:45.010 --> 26:45.270]  grape?
[26:46.470 --> 26:48.910]  I feel like you can throw a grape faster than you can
[26:48.910 --> 26:49.490]  drop one.
[26:50.590 --> 26:52.650]  Wait, how does that...
[26:52.650 --> 26:52.890]  Wait.
[26:53.970 --> 26:56.450]  Because of wind resistance. Air resistance.
[26:57.190 --> 26:58.010]  Okay. You know what?
[26:58.230 --> 26:59.350]  You bring up a good point.
[27:00.170 --> 27:02.230]  They're just so light. I don't think they would...
[27:02.230 --> 27:03.910]  I'm such a fan of...
[27:04.670 --> 27:06.250]  And you're asking if there's a maximum?
[27:07.370 --> 27:08.670]  Well, here's the thing. Even if you could
[27:08.670 --> 27:10.850]  throw a grape as hard as you possibly could
[27:10.850 --> 27:12.730]  into my mouth, way less
[27:12.730 --> 27:13.650]  damage than a kiwi.
[27:14.310 --> 27:15.150]  Should we try?
[27:17.370 --> 27:19.050]  Should we put a grape in the hotdog
[27:19.050 --> 27:20.770]  cannon and fire it in Gavin's face?
[27:20.790 --> 27:22.870]  But you see, that's going to be faster than terminal velocity.
[27:23.170 --> 27:24.910]  The terminal velocity of a
[27:24.910 --> 27:27.030]  grape is about 65 miles an
[27:27.030 --> 27:29.130]  hour. Right. I would not want
[27:29.130 --> 27:30.790]  to get hit. If you fight it from a cannon, you could
[27:30.790 --> 27:32.410]  probably get a 200 mile an hour grape.
[27:33.010 --> 27:33.970]  That would suck too.
[27:35.310 --> 27:37.150]  I think you would...
[27:37.950 --> 27:38.850]  Would you die?
[27:38.990 --> 27:40.370]  What's the terminal velocity of a kiwi?
[27:40.650 --> 27:42.510]  Somebody specifically left a Quora
[27:42.510 --> 27:44.210]  question that said, will a grape
[27:44.210 --> 27:46.370]  falling from the 22nd floor harm a child?
[27:48.570 --> 27:49.390]  What's the answer?
[27:49.830 --> 27:52.390]  A terminal velocity is 65
[27:52.390 --> 27:54.450]  miles an hour. It might leave a bruise if it hits
[27:54.450 --> 27:54.830]  their shoulder.
[27:56.870 --> 27:58.330]  Okay. I feel... I've had
[27:58.330 --> 28:00.450]  arguments about this in the past. I feel like I was
[28:00.450 --> 28:02.310]  on the right side based on this conversation.
[28:02.310 --> 28:04.430]  And what side was that? That I'm not really
[28:04.430 --> 28:06.390]  that worried about the grape falling from the Empire
[28:06.390 --> 28:07.870]  State Building. Yeah, I think you're fine.
[28:08.250 --> 28:10.290]  I think I'd be okay. Even like...
[28:10.290 --> 28:11.750]  Well, now an orange would be a problem.
[28:12.530 --> 28:13.870]  Apple would be disastrous.
[28:14.610 --> 28:15.730]  I mean, you could have something that's
[28:16.110 --> 28:18.170]  smaller than a grape, but more dense would do a lot
[28:18.170 --> 28:20.250]  more damage. What's denser than
[28:20.250 --> 28:22.390]  a grape, but smaller? A pinball?
[28:22.630 --> 28:23.070]  Ball bearing?
[28:24.170 --> 28:25.590]  Coin? I know.
[28:25.830 --> 28:28.250]  No, I meant in the context of fruit.
[28:28.810 --> 28:30.330]  Not in general. I thought we were talking
[28:30.330 --> 28:32.230]  fruit. I thought you were...
[28:32.230 --> 28:34.290]  I went immediately like, I can list probably
[28:34.290 --> 28:35.850]  ten things. Yeah, no, right.
[28:36.070 --> 28:38.330]  No, I'm not. That was intended to be in the
[28:38.330 --> 28:40.410]  context of fruit. In the context of fruit,
[28:40.510 --> 28:42.410]  I would say a cherry is denser than a grape.
[28:42.410 --> 28:43.530]  Oh, that's an interesting... yeah.
[28:43.870 --> 28:46.350]  It has a seed in it. A pit.
[28:46.550 --> 28:48.150]  It's gonna fuck you up. An olive.
[28:49.590 --> 28:50.610]  Be like a xenomorph
[28:50.610 --> 28:52.210]  if the fucking seed launches
[28:52.210 --> 28:54.470]  out upon impact and does extra damage.
[28:56.190 --> 28:57.350]  Stems from its core.
[28:58.210 --> 29:00.270]  I was gonna say, I have a quick other
[29:00.830 --> 29:02.330]  Jeff Card thing. I got another
[29:02.330 --> 29:04.470]  Jeff Update related thing
[29:04.470 --> 29:06.010]  for you guys. Very exciting.
[29:06.870 --> 29:08.270]  Update on the balloon.
[29:09.130 --> 29:10.150]  As of this morning.
[29:10.370 --> 29:11.690]  A new picture? New picture.
[29:12.270 --> 29:13.970]  Balloon's still up. Still living.
[29:14.730 --> 29:15.830]  I'm pretty sure
[29:15.830 --> 29:18.050]  that that is a vent and it is
[29:18.050 --> 29:20.110]  sucking the balloon into the vent and that's
[29:20.110 --> 29:22.110]  the only thing that is keeping that
[29:22.110 --> 29:23.850]  balloon up. Pretty sure of that, are you?
[29:24.030 --> 29:26.010]  Has the air conditioning been on for
[29:26.010 --> 29:27.170]  like two weeks straight?
[29:27.710 --> 29:29.910]  Well, it's just on automatic or whatever.
[29:30.550 --> 29:31.970]  Yeah, that... usually
[29:31.970 --> 29:33.750]  it comes on and off. That means it's...
[29:33.750 --> 29:35.110]  I think it's still up there on helium.
[29:35.550 --> 29:37.670]  Maybe it's still... Or it's like
[29:37.670 --> 29:38.650]  wedged in a little bit.
[29:39.450 --> 29:40.890]  I think it could be wedged.
[29:41.730 --> 29:43.450]  Because I tried to get it out of that corner
[29:44.590 --> 29:45.670]  and it started
[29:45.670 --> 29:47.550]  to fall. So I had to remove
[29:48.690 --> 29:49.710]  weight from the
[29:49.710 --> 29:51.510]  balloon to get it back in the sky
[29:52.570 --> 29:53.730]  and it went up
[29:53.730 --> 29:55.630]  and then it immediately ended up in that corner again
[29:55.630 --> 29:57.710]  and I haven't touched it since. It's where it wants
[29:57.710 --> 29:59.070]  to be. It's where it wants to be.
[29:59.690 --> 30:01.710]  And that's my great corner update. Jeff, what were you
[30:01.710 --> 30:03.350]  gonna say? I was just gonna say
[30:03.350 --> 30:05.030]  summer is officially over now.
[30:05.870 --> 30:07.110]  We're through summer
[30:07.690 --> 30:09.510]  and we're into Spummer, I guess.
[30:10.550 --> 30:11.690]  But I looked
[30:11.690 --> 30:13.730]  up the... because we talked about it earlier.
[30:13.950 --> 30:15.790]  I looked up the Songs of the
[30:15.790 --> 30:17.610]  Summer. The Billboard Top
[30:17.610 --> 30:19.590]  10 Global Songs of the Summer for
[30:19.590 --> 30:21.690]  2024. And I was wondering if you
[30:21.690 --> 30:23.650]  guys had your finger on the pulse enough
[30:23.650 --> 30:25.710]  to be able to name any of them. Like, what would
[30:25.710 --> 30:27.470]  you guys think Billboard
[30:27.470 --> 30:29.530]  would say the Song of the Summer was?
[30:30.530 --> 30:31.410]  I think
[30:32.530 --> 30:33.890]  the Double Shot of
[30:33.890 --> 30:35.550]  Whiskey song is up there.
[30:35.790 --> 30:37.450]  That one's up there and I think
[30:38.050 --> 30:39.530]  Espresso is probably on there.
[30:41.250 --> 30:41.870]  I would
[30:41.870 --> 30:43.030]  say probably
[30:44.630 --> 30:45.830]  Oh, Not Like
[30:45.830 --> 30:47.610]  Us. Yeah, that has to be
[30:47.610 --> 30:48.910]  the number one. If it's not
[30:49.530 --> 30:51.650]  number one, it's definitely in the top five.
[30:53.650 --> 30:55.250]  What else was big on TikTok?
[30:56.170 --> 30:56.930]  What was that song?
[30:56.930 --> 30:57.710]  I don't know.
[30:59.210 --> 31:01.130]  You never heard the full song of?
[31:01.210 --> 31:03.110]  Million Dollar Baby? That's probably on there.
[31:03.730 --> 31:04.870]  What about that Apple one?
[31:05.690 --> 31:06.470]  No, I think
[31:06.470 --> 31:08.910]  that came out too late for it to be on there.
[31:09.310 --> 31:09.830]  What about
[31:10.990 --> 31:12.390]  I like my
[31:12.930 --> 31:13.170]  whiskey
[31:14.390 --> 31:16.410]  That one. You know that one?
[31:16.730 --> 31:17.710]  Yeah, I know that one.
[31:19.990 --> 31:20.430]  Pavarotti?
[31:20.910 --> 31:22.050]  I think you're probably... what?
[31:22.370 --> 31:24.970]  I think I know what you're talking about, but I don't want to say
[31:24.970 --> 31:27.110]  it and be wrong and give one away.
[31:28.990 --> 31:30.550]  Is that a Hosier?
[31:30.930 --> 31:32.170]  Did Hosier sing that?
[31:33.030 --> 31:34.350]  Yes, I think he did.
[31:36.150 --> 31:37.170]  We said espresso,
[31:37.370 --> 31:39.190]  but I think Please Please Please is probably on there also.
[31:39.190 --> 31:40.930]  Yeah, that's also. And if that's on there,
[31:41.010 --> 31:43.110]  that means that Billie Eilish song is on there.
[31:43.630 --> 31:44.490]  Birds of a Feather.
[31:44.970 --> 31:46.830]  That might be too recent. No.
[31:47.150 --> 31:48.090]  Otherwise, you're right. No shot.
[31:48.650 --> 31:51.150]  You guys are so good at this.
[31:51.730 --> 31:52.990]  I'm so impressed with you.
[31:52.990 --> 31:55.170]  It's just the stuff that you hear on TikTok
[31:55.170 --> 31:56.870]  like on repeat.
[31:57.390 --> 31:58.550]  But you guys nailed it.
[31:58.590 --> 32:00.350]  You guys got almost everything. Number 10.
[32:00.550 --> 32:03.050]  I don't know what it is, but number 10 is Gata Only
[32:03.050 --> 32:04.470]  by Floyd Menor
[32:04.470 --> 32:05.830]  X Chris MJ.
[32:06.510 --> 32:08.790]  Which is like their gamer tag, I guess.
[32:09.350 --> 32:10.390]  Number 9
[32:10.990 --> 32:13.130]  is Tattoo Sweet by Hosier.
[32:13.690 --> 32:14.870]  Number 8 is
[32:14.870 --> 32:16.790]  something called Million Dollar Baby by
[32:16.790 --> 32:17.610]  Tommy Richman.
[32:18.790 --> 32:20.930]  Number 7 is Beautiful Things
[32:20.930 --> 32:22.610]  by Benson Boone.
[32:23.450 --> 32:24.530]  I don't know what that is.
[32:24.850 --> 32:27.430]  Number 6 is I Had Some Help by Post Malone
[32:27.430 --> 32:29.230]  featuring Morgan Wallen.
[32:29.370 --> 32:30.710]  Now that Morgan Wallen song. Yep.
[32:31.130 --> 32:32.630]  That's his country crossover shit.
[32:32.930 --> 32:34.970]  Number 5 is Not Like Us by Kendrick Lamar.
[32:35.070 --> 32:37.170]  Number 4 is Please Please Please by Sabrina Carpenter.
[32:37.630 --> 32:38.650]  Number 3 is
[32:38.650 --> 32:41.330]  A Bar Song Tipsy by Shaboosie.
[32:41.670 --> 32:42.570]  Oh, that's... yeah.
[32:43.130 --> 32:44.910]  And then number 2 is Billie Eilish
[32:44.910 --> 32:46.870]  Birds of a Feather. Number 1 was Sabrina Carpenter
[32:46.870 --> 32:48.810]  Espresso. So the song of the summer was
[32:48.810 --> 32:50.910]  Espresso by Sabrina Carpenter. I called that
[32:50.910 --> 32:52.830]  going into the summer. The first time I heard
[32:52.830 --> 32:54.370]  that song I went, oh this is gonna be
[32:54.370 --> 32:56.170]  everywhere all the time.
[32:56.770 --> 32:58.750]  Am I crazy though? That's already
[32:58.750 --> 33:00.850]  a song, right? Like that's been a song
[33:00.850 --> 33:02.070]  before. What?
[33:02.590 --> 33:04.750]  I don't know what you mean. Like she
[33:04.750 --> 33:06.890]  released it previously or you recognize
[33:06.890 --> 33:08.310]  it sounds similar to something else.
[33:08.510 --> 33:10.250]  It sounds like 95%
[33:10.810 --> 33:12.690]  of the way to a song that's old.
[33:13.030 --> 33:14.810]  What song? I don't know.
[33:14.890 --> 33:16.670]  It's pissing me off for 3 months.
[33:16.670 --> 33:18.690]  Do you know
[33:18.690 --> 33:20.650]  the story behind the song is
[33:20.650 --> 33:21.810]  the producer
[33:22.490 --> 33:22.990]  took
[33:24.570 --> 33:26.130]  sample stuff from
[33:26.660 --> 33:28.070]  what the fuck is that website?
[33:28.750 --> 33:30.830]  There's like a sampling
[33:30.830 --> 33:32.970]  website where you can just download
[33:32.970 --> 33:34.730]  hey, get like these samples and then
[33:34.730 --> 33:36.750]  you adjust them and everything. He just took
[33:36.750 --> 33:38.610]  the straight samples and then
[33:39.370 --> 33:40.850]  plussed up sort of like some background
[33:40.850 --> 33:42.750]  around it and then repeated it and that's
[33:42.750 --> 33:44.870]  the song. Like nobody performed anything
[33:44.870 --> 33:46.590]  on it. He just got like
[33:46.590 --> 33:48.890]  a GarageBand demo. Yeah, it was
[33:48.890 --> 33:50.810]  just like, oh here's two samples, put it together
[33:50.810 --> 33:52.910]  and that was it. This song cost me
[33:52.910 --> 33:55.510]  $17 to make off SoundDogs.com
[33:55.510 --> 33:56.350]  Yeah, right.
[33:57.430 --> 33:58.630]  So he went to
[33:58.630 --> 34:00.510]  the main riff and drums featured
[34:00.510 --> 34:02.570]  on the song are loops from a
[34:02.570 --> 34:04.810]  splice sample track called
[34:04.810 --> 34:06.810]  Power Tools Sample Pack
[34:06.810 --> 34:08.810]  3. God, it's Power
[34:08.810 --> 34:10.150]  Tools. That's so funny.
[34:10.710 --> 34:11.710]  It's like the
[34:13.250 --> 34:13.810]  gonging
[34:13.810 --> 34:15.090]  sound in Beat It
[34:15.710 --> 34:16.690]  by Michael Jackson
[34:17.610 --> 34:19.570]  was like just a
[34:19.570 --> 34:21.250]  sound demo from, it was like
[34:21.250 --> 34:23.590]  a synthesizer demo disc
[34:23.590 --> 34:25.730]  and he just took the whole thing and put it in
[34:25.730 --> 34:26.890]  the song. Oh wow.
[34:27.670 --> 34:29.850]  That's crazy. Stuff like that is awesome.
[34:30.230 --> 34:30.790]  There's one
[34:31.590 --> 34:33.290]  relatively recently I saw of
[34:34.270 --> 34:35.510]  Gorillaz, Clint Eastwood,
[34:35.650 --> 34:37.530]  the whole thing was the default
[34:37.530 --> 34:39.130]  for a keyboard he bought.
[34:39.130 --> 34:41.010]  The entire rhythm of it,
[34:41.050 --> 34:42.210]  he didn't come up with any of it.
[34:42.810 --> 34:45.630]  I saw one recently with the Leica G6
[34:45.630 --> 34:47.050]  like the kind of
[34:47.050 --> 34:49.330]  alarm in that was an accidentally
[34:49.330 --> 34:51.110]  made sound because he put the
[34:51.110 --> 34:52.790]  bell into the wrong track
[34:52.790 --> 34:55.110]  that was intended for bass. Oh, I love
[34:55.110 --> 34:57.150]  that stuff for music. There's an action
[34:57.150 --> 34:59.270]  Bronson song where he raps over
[34:59.270 --> 35:00.950]  the hold music at like a
[35:00.950 --> 35:03.170]  limo company or something and he just turns it
[35:03.170 --> 35:03.690]  into a whole song.
[35:05.630 --> 35:06.590]  That's great.
[35:06.590 --> 35:08.490]  All that shit is
[35:09.330 --> 35:10.930]  stuff like Shaggy's
[35:10.930 --> 35:12.590]  It Wasn't Me, the
[35:12.590 --> 35:14.590]  vocals on that were like
[35:14.590 --> 35:16.610]  a test recording. They're not even
[35:16.610 --> 35:18.690]  finalized properly recorded vocals
[35:18.690 --> 35:20.670]  because it was uncertain if
[35:20.670 --> 35:21.690]  that would even be a song.
[35:22.530 --> 35:24.510]  I find listening about
[35:24.510 --> 35:26.510]  how music and records are produced
[35:26.510 --> 35:28.430]  so interesting. Oh yeah, I love that.
[35:28.570 --> 35:30.590]  Gavin, what did you just send that sounds like something
[35:30.590 --> 35:31.670]  from Crash Bandicoot?
[35:33.570 --> 35:34.510]  Are you at the right
[35:34.510 --> 35:36.330]  time? I don't know. What time am I supposed
[35:36.330 --> 35:36.930]  to be at?
[35:38.550 --> 35:40.350]  Like 7-11, I guess?
[35:40.670 --> 35:40.790]  Okay.
[35:41.610 --> 35:44.070]  What am I listening to?
[35:46.530 --> 35:48.130]  You think that sounds like espresso?
[35:48.950 --> 35:49.570]  You might have.
[35:50.750 --> 35:52.130]  I don't know what it is.
[35:52.990 --> 35:54.050]  You said 7-11.
[35:54.450 --> 35:55.930]  I don't know. 7-15.
[35:58.790 --> 36:00.230]  Okay, so that's not
[36:00.230 --> 36:01.430]  Jesus Christ.
[36:01.430 --> 36:02.510]  That was really loud.
[36:03.030 --> 36:03.730]  Yeah, it's the gong.
[36:05.450 --> 36:07.130]  I thought we were still talking about
[36:07.130 --> 36:08.050]  espresso with you.
[36:08.970 --> 36:10.170]  I thought you found it.
[36:10.830 --> 36:12.990]  No, he found the gong thing from the
[36:12.990 --> 36:15.190]  Michael Jackson thing, but what he linked
[36:15.190 --> 36:16.970]  to at 7-11 sounds like
[36:16.970 --> 36:19.430]  something from Crash Bandicoot.
[36:20.010 --> 36:21.190]  Yeah, I just was
[36:21.190 --> 36:23.190]  looking at the comments because my sound
[36:23.190 --> 36:25.070]  isn't coming through right. It sounds like
[36:25.070 --> 36:27.110]  Jerry trying to Twinkle Toes sneak
[36:27.110 --> 36:27.690]  by Tom.
[36:27.690 --> 36:27.990]  Yeah.
[36:29.650 --> 36:31.650]  What if Michael Jackson used that
[36:31.650 --> 36:33.270]  instead of the gong sound?
[36:34.990 --> 36:35.810]  Last night
[36:35.810 --> 36:37.770]  we were talking about songs we'd heard
[36:37.770 --> 36:39.730]  the most in our lives, and
[36:39.730 --> 36:41.270]  I said the National Anthem
[36:41.270 --> 36:43.370]  is probably way up there for me.
[36:43.690 --> 36:45.630]  And then we were saying like, oh Jeff, you probably heard that a lot
[36:45.630 --> 36:47.690]  in the Army. And then we're like, oh no,
[36:47.850 --> 36:49.510]  what's the song they play on the
[36:49.510 --> 36:51.830]  do-do-do-do-do-do? And Jeff and Nick
[36:51.830 --> 36:53.430]  started humming
[36:53.430 --> 36:55.490]  Duel of the Fates.
[36:55.490 --> 36:57.550]  Like that's the
[36:57.550 --> 36:59.690]  song of the Army song.
[37:01.190 --> 37:03.550]  And we all started
[37:03.550 --> 37:05.490]  going...
[37:07.670 --> 37:09.210]  Nick thought that was
[37:09.210 --> 37:09.830]  revelry.
[37:15.290 --> 37:17.870]  With the transition
[37:17.870 --> 37:19.450]  from summer
[37:19.450 --> 37:21.150]  into fall...
[37:21.150 --> 37:23.510]  NFL season is on. We did
[37:23.510 --> 37:28.690]  The kicker picker, we all pick kickers. We're tracking that throughout the next few months,
[37:28.750 --> 37:35.290]  seeing who will get the most points, field goals and extra points. We also did as part
[37:35.290 --> 37:40.410]  of... I thought, you know, it'd be so much fun for the August Falcon event if we did
[37:40.410 --> 37:44.930]  an eliminator pool, which is something I've never done before, but I've always wanted
[37:44.930 --> 37:50.810]  to do it. It always seems like fun. The idea being that you pick one team every week,
[37:50.810 --> 37:57.430]  and if the team you pick is... if they lose, you're eliminated. If they win, you continue,
[37:57.630 --> 38:02.150]  but you can't pick that team again. They're eliminated from your choices. So I organized
[38:02.150 --> 38:07.610]  a whole Falcon thing around it. I made, I think, 11 different leagues so that we could
[38:07.610 --> 38:12.770]  have multiple winners, which I thought was fun. Put it all together, we started it, and I said
[38:12.770 --> 38:17.790]  to the... I pitched this the night before to everybody here, letting them know that I had
[38:17.790 --> 38:24.290]  done this, and we were going to share an account, and we'd go in and egg order, me starting first,
[38:24.510 --> 38:31.690]  then we'd go to Nick and Eric, Jeff and Gavin, and see how long we could keep this chain going.
[38:32.110 --> 38:40.350]  I was real excited about it. And how far did we get, guys? Who's ready for your next...
[38:40.350 --> 38:44.350]  your pick? Well, do you want to talk about your awesome fucking pick? Yeah, yeah,
[38:44.350 --> 38:50.830]  you're really smart, good pick. I could pick any team, and I scrolled through, and I was like, well,
[38:51.190 --> 38:55.750]  the first week, you know, you want to go for a favorite, because you don't necessarily know
[38:56.270 --> 39:00.590]  how bad the other teams are. So I went with the Bengals against the Patriots in week one,
[39:00.990 --> 39:06.850]  and I didn't even pay attention to that game until late into the morning, and I checked,
[39:07.410 --> 39:11.830]  and the Bengals were down by, I believe, nine or eight when I looked, and I said,
[39:11.830 --> 39:20.590]  what the fuck is happening? And we're out of the pool. We're eliminated. I am so sorry, guys.
[39:20.970 --> 39:26.050]  Fucking week one, dude. We were out before I even understood what you were doing. He still
[39:26.050 --> 39:32.610]  doesn't understand what you did. I still don't. It was less than 24 hours from me describing what
[39:32.610 --> 39:38.530]  we were going to do and how we're going to rotate who makes the picks to me eliminating us from the
[39:38.530 --> 39:44.290]  pool. There are plenty of other Falcons still in it, and I'm tracking it, and I'm watching. It's
[39:44.290 --> 39:49.990]  a lot of fun, but I fucking suck. I'm bad at this, apparently. So do the Falcons already know that
[39:49.990 --> 39:56.150]  we're out? In some of the leagues, it's very obvious. In other leagues, no. But now they will
[39:56.150 --> 40:03.210]  all know that we are out of this race. I watched that whole Bengals game because it's in my
[40:03.210 --> 40:09.110]  screbs, as I call it, and it was a train wreck. It was unbelievable. Also, Ramondre Stevenson
[40:09.110 --> 40:16.670]  looks awesome this season. In my defense, I think it was probably the biggest upset of the weekend
[40:16.670 --> 40:22.530]  and probably the biggest upset. They were huge underdogs, the Patriots, going into that matchup.
[40:22.630 --> 40:26.570]  Nobody had them winning. No, it's true. I don't think anybody on earth thought that they were
[40:26.570 --> 40:32.790]  going to win that game. And I picked them, and we got eliminated from the pool. But that's not only
[40:32.790 --> 40:39.230]  where my fucking luck ends with football. It's been a terrible start for me and the NFL. We did
[40:39.230 --> 40:43.850]  a Kicker Picker, which is a supplemental you can watch or listen to, where we went through the NFL.
[40:44.090 --> 40:51.790]  We each picked kickers. We have a roster of kickers. And part of that process that we discuss
[40:51.790 --> 41:00.250]  is if a kicker gets hurt or they get released or whatever, you cannot replace them. And I got
[41:00.250 --> 41:07.790]  betrayed by Cade York. Cade York, one of my picks, got fucking fired from his job in week one.
[41:08.690 --> 41:17.850]  He is cut from the team. Why? Because he missed two kicks in the first week. And so the team
[41:17.850 --> 41:25.030]  fired him. And I'm down a kicker unless somebody else hires. Look at him. I picked him because he
[41:25.030 --> 41:32.910]  had this dumb smile. He seems so happy, but everyone else is serious. And I now have beef
[41:32.910 --> 41:37.850]  with Cade York. I mean, I'm sure he's more upset than I am that he doesn't have a job currently.
[41:38.470 --> 41:43.090]  What team was he on? He was on the Commanders. He's the Washington Commanders kicker.
[41:43.370 --> 41:50.290]  Did you have an acronym that that now fucks up for you? No. Oh, well, never mind. I can't
[41:51.130 --> 41:55.870]  it's just so much to remember. You got to watch six teams and follow six teams all at once. It's
[41:55.870 --> 42:00.890]  hard. Now that he's not kicking for them, can we hire him if ever we need something kicked?
[42:01.910 --> 42:06.390]  What? Do you need something kicked? No, not currently, but it's nice to have.
[42:06.650 --> 42:10.770]  Okay, let me rephrase that question. Do you need something kicked accurately?
[42:14.410 --> 42:18.890]  As if not, I got your guy. Kick a kiwi into my mouth.
[42:20.530 --> 42:22.150]  Oh, aim small, miss small.
[42:23.950 --> 42:27.770]  You think it would be juicier to have a kiwi kicked into your mouth than if you were to bite
[42:27.770 --> 42:34.250]  into it? The explosion? Yeah, there'd be an explosion of teeth. All right. Can I add something
[42:34.250 --> 42:39.950]  to are we still doing the supplemental stuff tomorrow? Yeah, I think so. Can I add something
[42:39.950 --> 42:47.610]  to the itinerary? Yeah. Eric told me that there is no amount of blue cheese on something that is too
[42:47.610 --> 42:55.070]  much. Oh, no. Oh, no. I love blue cheese. I want to make something that's pretty heavily loaded
[42:55.070 --> 42:59.790]  with blue cheese to see if Eric can get through it. I think that's a good idea. Also, should we
[43:00.490 --> 43:03.770]  and I don't know if I'll be able to do it. So I'm asking the group because I have a
[43:03.770 --> 43:08.390]  washing machine repairman coming at nine a.m. But should we pick up all that candy that we
[43:08.390 --> 43:13.470]  talked about so we can do the blind taste test with Gavin? Oh, yeah. I'd be easy to accomplish
[43:13.470 --> 43:17.310]  now. I mean, do we want to meet at a different time tomorrow or is that time still good?
[43:17.750 --> 43:20.810]  The time is still good. There just might be a guy outside the room fixing the washer.
[43:21.070 --> 43:26.210]  OK, but then but then we have to go get the candy, right? I was just going to see if somebody could
[43:26.210 --> 43:30.430]  pick it up before. So here's what so here's what the issue is with what we're talking about.
[43:31.530 --> 43:37.070]  We is not me. That's why I'm addressing the group. We could be Nick. It could be Gavin.
[43:37.390 --> 43:42.550]  It could be anybody could pick the candy up today. Has anyone any four of you going out
[43:42.550 --> 43:47.170]  today? You know what? I can go pick up the candy today after this. I'll do that.
[43:47.170 --> 43:53.110]  I just need a list of what to get. Eric has turned we is not me into me never is. What?
[43:53.390 --> 44:00.610]  Like I never said it. I just the group. And I said, could somebody maybe if I can't do it?
[44:00.610 --> 44:03.430]  And then Eric said, it's not me. And I was like, I get it. I didn't say you,
[44:03.510 --> 44:06.390]  but it could be Gavin. It could be Nick. It would be that's how all that went. Yeah,
[44:06.450 --> 44:12.050]  yeah. That's right. I mean, isn't that how that went? Am I crazy? Yes. Yeah. You could have it
[44:12.050 --> 44:17.010]  even delivered to you. Am I crazy? Did you really think I was talking to you?
[44:17.170 --> 44:22.710]  Yes, because because yes, because I didn't get that tool because when this defaults,
[44:22.710 --> 44:27.330]  no, because here's the issue and I'm fine with it. I'm fine. I'm fine with I'm fine with talking
[44:27.330 --> 44:31.050]  about it and figuring it out. I'm trying to get ahead of it because a lot of this is like
[44:31.570 --> 44:38.270]  I get worried when we go into these things late that something falls and then the supplemental
[44:38.270 --> 44:43.530]  that we wanted to do, we couldn't do it because I didn't get around to it because the rest of my
[44:43.530 --> 44:49.310]  day is packed. But Jesus Christ, dude, that's why I addressed the group and said, can somebody get
[44:49.310 --> 44:53.430]  the fucking candy ahead of time so we're not caught flat footed? I didn't say, Eric, can you
[44:53.430 --> 44:58.990]  get the candy? I was addressing the group as I don't know why you took it as you. I was. No,
[44:59.010 --> 45:04.430]  you're right. I apologize. No, you're right. I just don't want us to be stuck in the room and
[45:04.430 --> 45:10.110]  realize that we could have made more than we than we're going to. And yeah, I will take on the candy.
[45:10.110 --> 45:13.530]  I don't want to make this even more complicated, but we could also try potato toast.
[45:13.930 --> 45:21.970]  You is they. I think that's a great idea as well. Well, it's funny. Me is we. What? What?
[45:22.370 --> 45:33.150]  I'm lost. Oh, I was never found. Speaking of potato toast. Yeah. I came prepared.
[45:33.150 --> 45:45.850]  Oh, you got some? I have created a sandwich. Open or closed? Open. It is the open faced
[45:45.850 --> 45:55.330]  mash hash cash sandwich is what I've created. Now, a slight wrinkle with it. I ordered all
[45:55.330 --> 46:00.730]  this stuff this morning to make it. And I did not know that the mashed potatoes would automatically
[46:00.730 --> 46:11.190]  come with gravy. That was not stated in the thing. Let me take a photo of open the open faced
[46:11.770 --> 46:17.270]  mash hash cash sandwich. Now, what an open faced. How can the gravy be already in mash hash cash
[46:17.270 --> 46:26.090]  sandwiches? You have your toast. You have the mash on top of the toast. You have then some hash
[46:26.090 --> 46:33.550]  browns on top of the mash. And then I had a I'm going to be honest. It was originally going to be
[46:33.550 --> 46:40.710]  the open face mash hash stash sandwich because I had a fake mustache somewhere in my desk, but I
[46:40.710 --> 46:47.030]  couldn't find it. However, I did find a five dollar bill. Pretty good day for me. And it also still
[46:47.030 --> 46:52.870]  rhymes with mash. So did you eat? Did you eat around the five? No, I haven't tried it yet.
[46:53.390 --> 47:00.610]  I was waiting. There are no bites taken out of this. Half the bread's been eaten. No, it's I just
[47:00.610 --> 47:07.250]  put I ordered toast and I get I was given two full slices, but they were cut in halves and I didn't
[47:07.250 --> 47:12.310]  have utensils. So that was the best I could do without getting gravy everywhere because I want
[47:12.310 --> 47:19.690]  to go downstairs. I did this in the small. Whatever. Doesn't matter. Are you not? Can you not
[47:19.690 --> 47:26.790]  just be happy that I have the open faced mash hash hash sandwich and instead criticize all these
[47:26.790 --> 47:32.110]  small details? Is that bag of peanuts behind it? No, those are it's called dragon boat mix. They
[47:32.110 --> 47:38.210]  sell it at Save on Foods. It's delicious. Oh, it looks good. Peanuts with a shell casing.
[47:39.490 --> 47:43.530]  It's a little shell. I don't know what the shell is made of, but it's peanuts in a shell. Very good.
[47:43.530 --> 47:49.330]  But it is probably not as good as the open faced mash hash hash sandwich,
[47:49.930 --> 47:53.410]  which I'm prepared to take a bite of. So you've not tried any yet?
[47:53.930 --> 47:58.790]  Haven't tried a bite yet. I've noticed that the entire plate is on top of your keyboard.
[47:59.670 --> 48:05.830]  No, on top of my laptop, actually. Okay. Which has a keyboard. Which does have a keyboard.
[48:06.730 --> 48:12.410]  That is correct. Open laptop. Closed laptop. Where can I see the keys? You got keys on the
[48:12.410 --> 48:16.210]  top of your lid? No, no, no, no, no. We've been over this before. I have two keyboards.
[48:17.750 --> 48:21.230]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. So it's on top of your keyboard, but it's not on top of your keyboard.
[48:22.010 --> 48:26.110]  No, it's not on my keyboard. It's on my laptop. My laptop's closed and there's a keyboard on
[48:26.110 --> 48:34.770]  top of it. Okay. So the keyboard is below the laptop. In front of it. It's below and in front.
[48:35.410 --> 48:39.310]  And that's how it gets crumbs. That's how it gets crumbs on it is because I put the plate
[48:40.090 --> 48:46.250]  on the closed laptop lid and then crummage happens between me. I've got a solution for this,
[48:46.290 --> 48:52.090]  by the way. Yeah. What's the solution? Put the plate literally anywhere else. I can't. No room.
[48:52.610 --> 48:59.730]  Desk is full. Only space I can fit a plate at the moment. It's like living in an Airstream.
[49:00.450 --> 49:04.770]  That, uh, you know, it pivots to something else I could do after this. We'll talk about,
[49:04.770 --> 49:10.890]  but I'm first going to have a bite of this delicious, cold, open face. Oh,
[49:11.630 --> 49:18.410]  I wonder if you'll hear the crunch. I don't. I'll try. He says cold. Oh. Oh.
[49:20.370 --> 49:29.170]  It's not very cloisty. Yeah, he definitely said cloisty. I feel like cold would not be the way
[49:29.170 --> 49:35.450]  to do it. Nah. Like cold mashed potatoes. How would you heat up each element individually? Or
[49:35.450 --> 49:38.870]  do you think that now that you've put the $5 bill on it, you just toss that in the microwave
[49:38.870 --> 49:43.650]  and get it going is one thing. Yeah. The $5 bill cover cover keeps it from making a mess.
[49:46.230 --> 49:54.110]  Kind of operates like it's like a steam blanket. Yeah. He's so silent. Did you choke and die?
[49:54.890 --> 49:58.770]  I'm just, I'm eating it. Canadian money is plastic, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[49:59.170 --> 50:06.810]  You know what? It's actually pretty good. I wouldn't order that, but the hash creates a
[50:06.810 --> 50:14.890]  little bit of a fun texture with the mash and the bread surprisingly combines both things very well.
[50:15.750 --> 50:21.930]  That was pretty good. As I said, I would not expect an open faced mash hash cash sandwich
[50:21.930 --> 50:27.990]  to be on a menu. And I don't think I'd order it twice if it was, but I'm excited to see your
[50:27.990 --> 50:34.110]  guys' results with this because I, I think it was pretty good. I thought that we were one and done
[50:34.110 --> 50:37.770]  with the cookbook, but it's pretty clear to me that we're going to have to make a second one
[50:37.770 --> 50:45.770]  because we keep coming up with recipes. Um... Raise the rudders! Raise the sails! Raise the
[50:45.770 --> 50:52.390]  sails! Captain, an unidentified ship is approaching. Over. Roger. Wait, is that an

[51:27.430 --> 51:32.630]  good. I'm excited to see what you guys try to do with this sandwich setup. So what do I need to
[51:32.630 --> 51:37.690]  prepare for potatoes? That's a good question, Gavin. What do you expect? Well, what I originally wanted
[51:37.690 --> 51:44.210]  was to spread the mash on toast. Uh-huh. And then put the little crispy onion. Onion? Crispy onions.
[51:44.430 --> 51:49.910]  Sprinkles with a bit of black pepper. Okay. Because in my head, it can just stay pasted to the bread.
[51:49.910 --> 51:54.350]  Like if you tip the bread upside down, it would all still be on there. And the crispy onion
[51:54.350 --> 51:57.970]  sprinkles are just like the ones you have that like on top of uh, you have it like Thanksgiving,
[51:58.130 --> 52:02.490]  right? That's what you're talking about? Uh, yeah, we can make that work. I think it's like the
[52:02.490 --> 52:08.950]  like the the French's onion crispy things. Right, okay. Speaking of things that we need to clean up,
[52:09.110 --> 52:14.090]  Eric, I'm sending you a slack right now. Okay. We're getting into something serious that we've
[52:14.090 --> 52:18.310]  been putting off for a while, but I believe we're all ready to talk about it now. Oh.
[52:19.130 --> 52:25.210]  We did puzzles. We had a puzzle competition. Did we turn times in? I don't think we have
[52:25.210 --> 52:30.150]  times from everyone. Gavin said he was done and he had a time to submit. Is that incorrect?
[52:31.810 --> 52:37.990]  Should I have submitted it already? Okay. Just submit it to Eric via slack right now. Do you
[52:37.990 --> 52:43.770]  have a time that you can submit? It's been so long I don't remember my time. I need a picture as well.
[52:43.770 --> 52:48.190]  Okay. What does what do you mean that you need? I'm going to send Eric my time.
[52:48.850 --> 52:54.250]  Now here's I think the issue. I have to find where Jeff put his time. Which would have been
[52:54.250 --> 52:59.810]  okay. All right. Three months ago. Yeah. Don't. Yeah. All right. Where do you want this, Eric,
[52:59.930 --> 53:06.170]  on slack? You can slack it to me. It's fine. Now Gavin seemed worried that he he had some issue
[53:06.170 --> 53:11.530]  with his and that made me feel a lot better about mine because I definitely had some issues that we
[53:11.530 --> 53:22.170]  will get into. Mm hmm. Yeah, there's a. I'm like mad at you, I think. Oh, my God. Which one? Who?
[53:22.370 --> 53:32.630]  Which one? I'm mad at Andrew. Oh, yeah. We'll get into this. This is not I'm mad at everyone.
[53:33.310 --> 53:40.410]  Jeff is the only one. Hey, Jeff, I'm just letting you know you win. Oh, here's here's what's going
[53:40.410 --> 53:48.250]  on. Here's what's going on. Get a drum roll. No, no. This sucks. This sucks. This goes through
[53:48.250 --> 53:55.990]  and then we can explain. I'm trying to find Jeff's time. It doesn't matter. He wins by default.
[53:56.350 --> 54:02.770]  I guess I think I just posted it in the chat. Oh, there we go. Did a great job. Jeff did a
[54:02.770 --> 54:08.270]  great job. I think that's why I couldn't find it because it was four hours in four hours,
[54:08.270 --> 54:14.410]  three minutes, 26 seconds. Wow. That's really good, Jeff. That's that's really good. That puzzle
[54:14.410 --> 54:21.670]  was a motherfucker. It was. It was. And Gavin's time was one hour and five minutes. What?
[54:25.970 --> 54:28.790]  However, that's the image that Gavin submitted to me.
[54:29.730 --> 54:35.750]  So that's where I was after an hour and five minutes. Pause the timer, had to go out,
[54:36.490 --> 54:40.110]  came back and the cats had kicked it, kicked the shit out of it.
[54:40.910 --> 54:44.450]  And let's face it, if I was at that point in an hour and five minutes, I would have been like for
[54:44.450 --> 54:52.490]  24 hours. Yeah, I I hate that puzzle so much. The entire rim is green and trees. You don't know what
[54:52.490 --> 55:00.270]  you're working on. It's bullshit. I hated it. It was the worst hour. That might be the least
[55:01.470 --> 55:05.970]  impressive amount of work in an hour I've ever seen. Oh, interesting. And that was that was
[55:06.770 --> 55:11.070]  entirely focused only on the puzzle for an hour straight. And that's what I got out of it. Uh-huh.
[55:11.970 --> 55:15.250]  Jeff, would you like to see Andrew's puzzle time? Yeah, just for the record,
[55:15.330 --> 55:20.270]  he connected 26 puzzle pieces in an hour and five minutes. I counted.
[55:22.670 --> 55:24.870]  That's about one every three minutes, I guess.
[55:24.870 --> 55:32.850]  Uh-huh. So this is my time. It was all edge pieces. Yeah. And then and then here's Andrew's
[55:32.850 --> 55:42.390]  submitted time. My puzzle time, August 13th, 1140 a.m. So I started August 13th, 1140 a.m. We've
[55:42.390 --> 55:49.830]  talked about I don't have a table. And so my plan was to take the things off my desk, which I did.
[55:49.830 --> 55:58.770]  I removed my whole setup and it wasn't enough space for the puzzle. I just had a giant pile
[55:58.770 --> 56:07.730]  of pieces and I spent two hours trying to put it together. And I was struggling because I couldn't
[56:07.730 --> 56:15.470]  see the pieces. I did about as many as Gavin did in two hours and realized I cannot complete it
[56:15.470 --> 56:20.330]  under these conditions. Why don't you just do it on the floor? Oh, yeah. It worked great for you.
[56:20.610 --> 56:28.410]  That's a great plan. Great suggestion, buddy. Good call. Because I knew if I left it on the
[56:28.410 --> 56:32.590]  floor, it would get fucked up in some way. So I couldn't do that. I just didn't have a surface
[56:32.590 --> 56:38.330]  for it. I could have done on my bed, I guess, but that also just there was no great outcome for me.
[56:38.850 --> 56:44.310]  How would she do a puzzle on a bed? It was a lot larger area than I had on my desk. And the
[56:44.310 --> 56:50.830]  problem was I had to pile the pieces. So I had all of the edge pieces and I had a lot of fun
[56:50.830 --> 56:56.430]  setting that up. But it just I didn't have the space to follow through on my puzzle. Where's
[56:56.430 --> 57:00.570]  the picture of your progress, though? I didn't take a photo of the pro because there was no
[57:00.570 --> 57:05.530]  it didn't even occur to me to take. It was so pitiful. I like I would look at what you did
[57:05.530 --> 57:10.930]  and it would never consider like I wouldn't consider taking a photo because I knew Jeff
[57:10.930 --> 57:15.470]  would have aced this thing. Can I admit something, though? I didn't know I was even a part of this
[57:15.470 --> 57:20.310]  puzzle thing until one arrived. I thought that was just you and Jeff doing it. No, that was absolutely
[57:20.310 --> 57:26.950]  all of us. Yeah. From the beginning. So Nick and Eric did it? No, it was the three of us. It was
[57:26.950 --> 57:32.350]  pretty clearly covered, I feel like. I felt like it was also pretty clearly covered and I completely
[57:32.350 --> 57:39.610]  hand up. I salad creamed mine 100 percent. Absolutely fucked it. I would love I will do
[57:39.610 --> 57:45.390]  this puzzle when I have the space to do it. There will be an update on that. I haven't had a table
[57:45.390 --> 57:51.470]  in this place for three years, so it might you know, I don't know when that will happen, but I
[57:51.470 --> 57:56.970]  had a lot of fun doing it. And Jeff, I am genuinely incredibly impressed because even with a full
[57:56.970 --> 58:03.750]  table, I don't think my time would come close to yours. Your puzzle skills shined. Oh, that's very
[58:03.750 --> 58:09.330]  kind of you. As the only one who competed, I feel pretty good about myself. Yeah, no kidding. I'd
[58:09.330 --> 58:14.150]  love to do this again someday, maybe when we're all in different places in our lives and can
[58:14.150 --> 58:20.530]  accommodate the space of a 500 piece puzzle. It was a 1000 piece puzzle. That was a 500 piece puzzle.
[58:21.710 --> 58:27.090]  And that's why I picked it. Yeah, 1000 piece puzzle would have taken forever. We can go to
[58:27.090 --> 58:32.290]  seven. I mean, if seven works a little bit better for you guys. I was very unhappy with my time.
[58:32.770 --> 58:37.170]  Took about an hour longer than I thought I would like to do it again someday with a different
[58:37.170 --> 58:43.030]  puzzle. Where did you struggle? Is it all the trees in the top? The trees and the leaves. I
[58:43.030 --> 58:47.370]  thought it was such a nightmare. Like the way to tackle that puzzle is you do the you do the border
[58:47.370 --> 58:52.450]  real fast. You knock it out. That's not hard. Then you pull all the fur out to the side and deal
[58:52.450 --> 58:57.470]  with the bears later. The easiest thing to tackle then is the sky. So you do the sun, all the red
[58:57.470 --> 59:02.530]  and the orange. Once that's done, you don't have much room for the blue. So you fill the blue in
[59:02.530 --> 59:06.430]  and then it gets hard. Then you got to work the trees out. And that's where it gets real sucky.
[59:06.490 --> 59:11.530]  I'm such a big fan of you saying that you just knock out the border real quick. And I just
[59:11.530 --> 59:17.270]  scrolled back up to look at Gavin's picture. I could not figure out which tree was on which
[59:17.270 --> 59:22.050]  side. I could not figure it out. Gavin, you certainly have a table. Why did you choose to make it on the
[59:22.050 --> 59:28.890]  floor? That's just... that's always where I've done puzzles. I don't think I've ever done a puzzle on a table.
[59:30.470 --> 59:37.650]  What? That's a... it's a weird choice. Is it? Yeah. I thought the floor was like the go-to place to do it. No.
[59:38.330 --> 59:43.470]  For a kid. Easy to kick. I mean, Geoff, you're the puzzle professional here. What do you think?
[59:43.470 --> 59:50.170]  I always do it at a... on a table. Yeah. I've always done it on a table. I did that one on my
[59:50.170 --> 59:54.890]  kitchen counter, which is why I had to do it in one sitting. So I just sat down and did it and then...
[59:54.890 --> 01:00:00.070]  Yeah, that was my plan. I have very fond memories of like going to my grandparents' house and they
[01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:04.210]  would have a table with a puzzle on it and you could just work away when you felt like it.
[01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:09.230]  I don't know that I've ever done a puzzle in one sitting like that before. That was interesting.
[01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:12.070]  Because, you know, for me, it's like a stress reliever thing like you're describing with your
[01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:16.810]  grandparents, so I do it like an hour a day or a half hour a day. That was... it was fun to do it
[01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:23.210]  that focused. So it was a pleasant four hours? It flew by. Did you have anything on listening to
[01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:27.010]  or like watching TV or something? Yeah, I was listening to podcasts. I think I was probably
[01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:31.410]  listening to like Bill Simmons or something. Where did you go? Like, what did you have to
[01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:35.990]  do, Gavin, that interrupted you from the puzzle? Oh, I don't remember. It's like two months ago.
[01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:41.550]  I had to go out. I just I don't know why. Like, if you had to leave in an hour,
[01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:45.270]  I don't know why you'd start a floor puzzle. Yeah, I didn't know how long it would take.
[01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:51.530]  I thought you'd do it in less than an hour. I definitely got to say, as a person who owns
[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:56.010]  a lot of cats and has owned them for a while, a floor anything seems like an odd choice.
[01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:03.950]  I think this might be the first puzzle I've done in 20 years. I think I just...
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:08.690]  Okay. I don't think I ever got good at them. You're just overconfident. Oh, yeah. Done is
[01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:14.470]  a strong word. You and I did not do a puzzle. Well, I mean, as far as I know, you could have
[01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:19.290]  just written the date. You didn't. You didn't put any time in. There's no evidence that you did
[01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:24.970]  anything apart from write the date down. Okay, you're right. Give me... I'll take 15 minutes
[01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:31.690]  and I'll throw the pieces on the floor and combine 26 pieces. All right. Okay, genius.
[01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:37.250]  Genius. Put together the bottom row in 15 minutes. Let me get the pieces out.
[01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:43.850]  There's no winning, though. Like, I don't know. Like, even if I do that, 15 pieces,
[01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:48.950]  what's the bottom row? Listen, we both fucked this up tremendously.
[01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:56.750]  I was so worried about mine knowing I had fucked mine up. And then when you express doubt about
[01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:01.670]  submitting stuff and concern, I felt so much better. Well, I want to go back to the original
[01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:07.550]  episode and see if I was ever a part of this. Yep. Well, it's available online for free,
[01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:13.350]  so you can do that whenever you choose to. And as the person who typically proofs them,
[01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:17.510]  you should be the most aware. Well, not if it was never said.
[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:25.910]  Listen, I can't wait to record episode... what is this, 21? I can't wait to record episode 22
[01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:34.410]  for Gavin to go, I got a clip. You better have a goddamn clip. Either way. He's only
[01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:39.150]  going to have a clip if it exonerates him. No, I've had clips against me before. Okay.
[01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:44.210]  Oh, yeah, that's true. Fair enough. Fair enough. We can all be taken down.
[01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:53.510]  It was back in June. Let's see what episode this was. I'm trying to narrow in on it.
[01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:01.250]  Jeff shared puzzles and we talked about puzzles for a while.
[01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:07.570]  The reason I bought and sent you a puzzle is because you were part of it. So I don't know,
[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:12.830]  man. I don't know what to tell you. What episode was it? That's what I'm looking at right now
[01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:18.630]  to see if there's a... it might be eight. Potentially could be eight. That was 500 pieces.
[01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:24.790]  Yeah. A thousand piece puzzle would have been a fucking nightmare to do in one sitting.
[01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:32.030]  For the record, by the way, this went almost exactly as I expected it to go.
[01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:39.090]  Yeah. I was on... I was furious. What? Why? I started it quite excited and I can't believe
[01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:44.110]  how livid I was after about half an hour. I also was very excited. Why didn't you just
[01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:48.570]  let Meg help you? She wanted to put together the puzzle so bad. Oh, she did the puzzle.
[01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:52.770]  She did it. She had it finished like less than a week later. She'd already done it.
[01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.370]  Did she do it on a table? Yeah.
[01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:08.990]  Oh, my God. I was trying to find the puzzle. I was like, where did I... where did I put it?
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:14.390]  And then I remembered, oh, it's actually... I remember how I had the Norm DVD supporting the
[01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:21.130]  laptop and I swapped it and I... the number was under my nose the entire time. It's just right
[01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:25.570]  there. Don't stop. You have to stop showing Gavin your keyboard. He's going to go insane.
[01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:30.550]  He's going to get so mad. Absolutely disgusting. That is the honey mustard
[01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:35.930]  remnants that I told you about. Yeah. I spilled it. It's a little honey mustard.
[01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:47.490]  I, uh, can I tell you guys, I, uh, I gave myself a good old fashioned face the other day. Yeah,
[01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:51.110]  you did. Yesterday. What did you do? I feel like I should share it. I told them last night.
[01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:58.770]  Andrew, but you haven't heard it yet. So yesterday morning, Nick posted to the group a list of about
[01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:06.370]  20 episodes of face that he needed clean audio from. The reason being we're going back and we're
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:11.350]  making like best ofs and compilations and stuff. And we're doing sort of like a compilation of
[01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:17.670]  different periods of the show. And we need to strip out the licensed music. The old intro to
[01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:22.370]  the show, because we no longer like, I guess we can keep the old episodes up that already have
[01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:26.090]  it, that we're paid for, but we can't like we like reuse it. Right. I just thought we couldn't
[01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:31.090]  use it for this or for this. Right. But the old thing is the old thing. The old thing is the
[01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.950]  old thing where we had the rights for it. And then. Right. But if we re upload now, like we
[01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:42.390]  don't have. It's still the old thing. I don't know. I actually like stripping it out for the purposes
[01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:46.950]  of what we're doing here. I think it makes it cleaner. I just I don't know. Like, I'll say,
[01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:50.510]  yeah, man, go ahead and just put it up with the music and then we just deal with the consequences,
[01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:55.550]  I guess. I mean, I'm not the arbiter of this. I just. Well, listen, I already fuckface myself,
[01:05:55.590 --> 01:06:01.430]  so there's no reason to do all that. So anyway, he posted a list of like 20 episodes. The first
[01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:07.850]  one was episode four. The it went up into the 50s. Right. And he said, like, I just need everybody's
[01:06:07.850 --> 01:06:12.270]  audio from these episodes. And I thought, I'm going to fucking I'm gung ho about this. I want
[01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:18.130]  anytime Nick needs anything. I feel like I feel like Nick does a lot of work for regulation that
[01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:22.970]  requires other people to send stuff to him. And I never want to be the hold up for Nick to get
[01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:26.450]  shit done. And so I always try to get it done immediately. And so I sat down to find those
[01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:31.850]  episodes. And then I realized a couple of things all at once. One, my favorite thing to do at
[01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:38.170]  Rooster Teeth was to mislabel every file I ever created. I started doing that to Bernie, like
[01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:42.230]  around season two of Red vs. Blue. And then I did it to Jack for years at Achievement Hunter
[01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:49.270]  and the editors. And then I did it to regulation to Nick and the editors of F*** Face and regulation.
[01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:58.490]  And what I have is 205 episodes of F*** Face that are labeled things like SonicsNutsack.Wave
[01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:05.930]  or Jeff and Eric and Gav and Andrew and Nick talk about something.Wave or...
[01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:12.030]  I'll go and put my folder up. Mine's like, you know, F***Face193Gav and I'll already see a file
[01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:19.310]  in there called like ThursdayMouthSounds.Wave. Words with my face. Yeah, a lot of that stuff.
[01:07:19.550 --> 01:07:26.130]  And so that makes it real hard. The other thing that really fucks you is pleasantries are a
[01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:33.510]  motherfucker because the episode starts somewhere between like 90 seconds and 18 minutes into the
[01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:40.030]  recording and you're only getting your feed. So you're listening to a third or a quarter of
[01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:46.090]  conversations trying to figure out where the goddamn episode is going to start. And then we
[01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:51.610]  didn't label the episodes with numbers on the f***ing podcast apps for the first like 65 episodes.
[01:07:51.930 --> 01:07:58.210]  So those are no help. So you're like just trying to pick a... it f***ing hurts so bad. And then
[01:07:58.210 --> 01:08:03.190]  another thing that we did that really sucks is we just wouldn't do intros, right? So then even
[01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:07.450]  if you find the f***ing intro of the episode, you don't say what episode number it is. Sometimes we'd
[01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:15.490]  say it at the end. And so finding 20 distinct episodes where I mislabeled them, we don't talk
[01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:20.670]  about it for the first nine minutes. When we do talk about it, we refuse to say what episode number
[01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:24.570]  it is. And then we don't publish the episode number when we put it online. Made it almost
[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:30.350]  f***ing impossible for me to help Nick out. But I did it. It took two and a half hours to find 20
[01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:35.970]  f***ing episodes. And I wanted to pull my f***ing hair out by the end of it. I karmically f***ing
[01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:42.510]  faced myself so hard for 22 years of being a d***head with file naming. And I just want everybody
[01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:47.590]  that I have wronged in the past through that to know it got me. It got me hard yesterday.
[01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:53.430]  Can I tell you what I would have done? Yeah. I would have looked at the date that the folder
[01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:58.530]  was created and then looked at the date on my file. The date the folder was created was just
[01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:02.770]  an empty folder that didn't have anything in it. It was created the day yesterday.
[01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.490]  The Google Drive folder? Where I was uploading stuff, yeah.
[01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:08.330]  Yeah, those are new. Those are new.
[01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.870]  But you could just type in, you could just go to the folder of f***face103 or something and
[01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:17.110]  they'll tell you the date. Do we have access to those old Google Drives? I don't think so.
[01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:22.690]  I don't think we do. I do. Don't you? No. No? You linked me that whole thing?
[01:09:22.790 --> 01:09:24.430]  Yeah. Can you send that to Nick? Yeah.
[01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:30.650]  Just as an example of what Jeff's talking about, this is a random episode of the f***face podcast
[01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:37.510]  and his audio is uploaded as whofuckingknows.wave. Yeah.
[01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:43.110]  The only person who never uploaded to these was Nick. Do you have them and not upload them so
[01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:48.650]  you're the only person on earth who can actually recreate an episode of f***face in its pure form?
[01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:51.570]  I am so important right now.
[01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:56.590]  Well, you also didn't know about these folders. It's an interesting way to view it, but okay.
[01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:02.430]  Well, anyway, anything you can do to make Nick's life easier. It comes too late to help me in any
[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:09.330]  way whatsoever, but that's fine. The universe got its pound of flesh yesterday.
[01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:14.150]  Do you have any favorite filenames, Jeff, or is it just like you do the joke and it's gone?
[01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:20.330]  Yeah, usually the joke is only for me that makes sense to something that happened to me
[01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:25.450]  15 minutes to an hour earlier and I forget it one second after I make it to myself. Yeah,
[01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:29.930]  it's not I don't it doesn't stick with me. Like I don't know. They don't look like anything to me.
[01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:35.270]  I don't know what they mean when I look back on them. Somebody brought up I saw a post of
[01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:40.510]  my desktop with things that I apparently have an audacity file called commercial takes
[01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:46.290]  that AUP. Oh, that's the one you were talking about. I wonder if that's the like 25 minutes
[01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:52.930]  of me just doing different takes. And if so, you should probably release that. If so, we should
[01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:58.790]  release that because that commercial never came out. I never never learned which take they would
[01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:05.090]  have went with. Yeah. Oh, man. Well, we should wrap this episode up and we should look at that
[01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:09.550]  commercial takes thing because, boy, that could be some good supplemental content of just noises.
[01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:15.070]  As we wrap this up, let me leave you guys with a thought for some potential supplemental content
[01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:21.150]  that I don't think we should make. You guys have heard of time capsules, right? Yeah. Yes. What if
[01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:26.330]  we all made a special kind of time capsule where each one of us went and stole one thing
[01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:30.470]  from somewhere in the world and we all put it into a time capsule? We call it a crime capsule
[01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:39.210]  and then we bury it. And if anyone finds it, we all go to jail. Dude, crime capsule rules. Yeah,
[01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:46.670]  those are my notes. Oh, my God. So we just have to make sure the result of a crime is in there.
[01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:55.150]  Yeah. Yeah. Crime capsule. Crime capsule is such a funny sketch where it's like, oh, this is I
[01:11:55.150 --> 01:12:00.630]  didn't pay for the movie. Like it's a low stakes thing. And somebody just puts in a bloody knife.
[01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:06.030]  Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. The escalation, like the height for that sketch is so good.
[01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:10.810]  That's awesome. Oh, that's so that's such a funny premise, Jeff.
[01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:15.650]  Oh, well, thank you. There you go. Let's think about our crime capsules and what we would put
[01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:21.470]  in there. Wow. I love the crime capsule. All right. Well, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:26.010]  What would you put in your crime capsule? Don't actually do it. And if you do do it,
[01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:29.870]  don't credit us with it. It was a joke. We're not trying to get anybody killed
[01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:35.910]  and put into a capsule. But you should listen to our podcast. Subscribe to our Patreon if you
[01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:44.210]  want to. You can just go to Regulatreon.com or Jeff.sucks. Good luck spelling my name.
[01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:49.790]  And we'll see you next week. Is putting a swordfish in your ass a crime? Okay.
