[00:00.000 --> 00:03.700]  A massage chair can look extravagant.
[00:04.080 --> 00:06.760]  Eight different configurations. Adjustable intensity.
[00:07.040 --> 00:10.880]  And it's heated. And it feels so good.
[00:11.580 --> 00:14.240]  Yes, a massage chair can look extravagant.
[00:14.420 --> 00:15.900]  And two, well, even more.
[00:16.300 --> 00:18.540]  But when those massage chairs come with a car,
[00:19.860 --> 00:21.920]  they become quite practical.
[00:22.320 --> 00:25.660]  The new Volkswagen Teguan 2025, with premium features,
[00:25.760 --> 00:27.840]  like the front seats with massage available,
[00:27.840 --> 00:33.200]  Hello and welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:33.220 --> 00:36.220]  I'm sitting in the chair. I'm going down right now.
[00:36.640 --> 00:37.360]  I need to sit in the chair.
[00:37.780 --> 00:40.720]  Why? Why? You didn't do it at the end of the last episode.
[00:40.920 --> 00:41.600]  Why did you do that?
[00:41.600 --> 00:44.680]  Also, I gotta intro the fucking podcast first.
[00:44.820 --> 00:45.760]  I'm sitting in the chair. I don't care.
[00:46.280 --> 00:47.020]  You gotta, no, you can't.
[00:47.020 --> 00:47.500]  I'm going down right now.
[00:47.520 --> 00:50.260]  Let me get through the intro and I'll throw it to you.
[00:50.760 --> 00:53.340]  Let's do it properly. Let me throw it to you.
[00:53.340 --> 00:55.800]  All in favor of me sitting in the chair right now, say yes.
[00:55.800 --> 00:58.780]  Welcome to another episode of the Regulation Podcast.
[00:59.300 --> 01:02.780]  This is episode 000003.
[01:03.080 --> 01:03.940]  My name is Geoff Ramsey.
[01:04.040 --> 01:06.920]  With me as always, Andrew Patton, Gavin Free, Nick and Eric.
[01:07.120 --> 01:08.920]  Andrew, why don't you sit in that chair?
[01:09.180 --> 01:10.080]  I'm gonna sit in the chair.
[01:11.680 --> 01:12.700]  This is really nice.
[01:12.980 --> 01:14.480]  This is way better than what I was doing.
[01:14.740 --> 01:18.320]  My back has been so fucked because we've been recording everything today.
[01:18.560 --> 01:21.420]  This is our fourth recording, consecutively.
[01:22.280 --> 01:24.680]  My ass can't handle that in the other chair.
[01:24.680 --> 01:25.740]  I'm comfy.
[01:25.860 --> 01:27.260]  This is a great chair.
[01:27.480 --> 01:31.280]  To be honest, as soon as you sat down, I could hear your smile.
[01:31.780 --> 01:36.580]  He turned from a comedian to a comfy complainer, like instantly.
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.540]  I've been known to comfy complain, so I'm glad that it is bringing out that side of me.
[01:43.240 --> 01:43.820]  This is great.
[01:44.140 --> 01:46.080]  What are your immediate thoughts on the specifics?
[01:46.500 --> 01:48.400]  I can't believe I have a back now.
[01:48.700 --> 01:49.520]  That's wild.
[01:49.780 --> 01:51.140]  What happened to these?
[01:51.540 --> 01:52.340]  This is crazy.
[01:52.340 --> 01:59.560]  I don't think I'm going to tighten up in pain every hour or so and then have to get up.
[02:01.600 --> 02:06.120]  The thing with chairs is I never know how to use them is the problem.
[02:06.780 --> 02:08.600]  This has a lot of switches and stuff.
[02:08.860 --> 02:13.540]  There's always switches and levers and buttons and there's no instruction manual.
[02:13.960 --> 02:17.860]  So I just never use any of the attachments or fancy stuff.
[02:18.260 --> 02:21.360]  It surely does have a quick set up cheat sheet.
[02:21.360 --> 02:23.260]  There was no cheat sheet.
[02:23.640 --> 02:25.980]  You know who has one? Fucking YouTube.
[02:26.520 --> 02:28.080]  That's always confusing.
[02:28.340 --> 02:29.200]  I don't know.
[02:29.560 --> 02:37.820]  I guarantee you there's some boring three minute video that the company produced that explains very simply what each knob and whistle does.
[02:38.360 --> 02:41.420]  Do you think we could produce a more lively one?
[02:41.860 --> 02:42.120]  Yes.
[02:42.560 --> 02:45.900]  What if Andrew shoots a commercial that teaches the chair?
[02:46.600 --> 02:46.960]  That's great.
[02:46.960 --> 02:51.440]  I don't know how the chair... the problem is how do I learn how to... what the...
[02:51.440 --> 02:53.600]  I don't even know how to describe the thing.
[02:53.700 --> 02:55.120]  So how do I learn... how do I search...
[02:55.580 --> 02:57.680]  How do you... do it like the cavemen do it.
[02:57.720 --> 02:59.560]  Start banging shit together until you make fire.
[02:59.960 --> 03:02.200]  Yeah, why don't you wangle one of the knobs and see what happens.
[03:02.540 --> 03:02.780]  Yeah.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.240]  I don't...
[03:04.240 --> 03:07.660]  Turn something left, lift something up, lower a different one.
[03:07.680 --> 03:08.320]  It feels dangerous.
[03:08.500 --> 03:09.100]  Flip it to the right.
[03:09.880 --> 03:11.040]  Crank down one of them.
[03:11.580 --> 03:15.240]  I feel like there's certain knobs that only work if you're sitting in the chair when you use them.
[03:15.240 --> 03:16.720]  You are sitting in the chair.
[03:17.140 --> 03:21.220]  Yeah, but I don't want to use it while I'm sitting in it because that just feels like that'll be disastrous.
[03:21.840 --> 03:23.540]  Why don't you just tease one of them to see what goes on.
[03:23.920 --> 03:27.180]  Some of these only work when you're sitting in it, and I'm currently sitting in it.
[03:27.240 --> 03:29.160]  So I won't be pressing any of these things.
[03:29.360 --> 03:35.300]  They wouldn't... they don't... they didn't put like escape levers in there to jettison you out of the house.
[03:35.420 --> 03:38.060]  Like, they're all designed to increase your comfort.
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.320]  I feel like I'm gonna hit this button and the backrest is gonna snap down and I'm gonna roll out the back of the chair.
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.700]  He's treating it like Wonka's elevator. It's a chair.
[03:46.760 --> 03:49.400]  I am. I don't trust any of it.
[03:49.620 --> 03:53.940]  It's very well made. There's amazing... like, there's so many things on it that's customizable.
[03:54.400 --> 03:55.540]  I just am scared.
[03:55.900 --> 03:58.420]  What do you mean? Just do something.
[03:59.000 --> 04:01.280]  I just flipped a lever. I don't know what I did.
[04:01.540 --> 04:04.240]  I don't know what I did, but it's up now.
[04:04.480 --> 04:08.480]  You just bought a Ferrari, but you only drive it to the mailbox and back.
[04:09.820 --> 04:12.320]  See, what's terrifying is there isn't a lever on the same side.
[04:12.320 --> 04:13.900]  So what did I just do?
[04:15.280 --> 04:19.900]  It could be, like, the amount of tilt back. It could be lumbar.
[04:20.460 --> 04:23.980]  It could be the forwards and backwards of the sitting part.
[04:24.740 --> 04:26.260]  See, there's a lot of things you can do.
[04:26.600 --> 04:28.020]  It's like a goddamn tank.
[04:29.160 --> 04:29.860]  Levers everywhere.
[04:30.300 --> 04:31.240]  How many pedals are there?
[04:32.780 --> 04:33.300]  Six.
[04:34.420 --> 04:35.680]  Alright, calm down.
[04:37.920 --> 04:39.360]  Nobody needs that shit.
[04:42.800 --> 04:44.840]  It's not available. There's not a website anymore.
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.080]  So we gotta do it here.
[04:47.200 --> 04:48.660]  Herman Miller doesn't have a website anymore?
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.440]  Oh, I see.
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.080]  I've been having a pretty serious problem with my printer.
[04:57.160 --> 05:00.000]  What is the most serious issue you can have with a printer?
[05:00.460 --> 05:04.240]  So I print to it, right? It says, couldn't find printer.
[05:05.100 --> 05:06.900]  Or, like, it just doesn't print.
[05:07.940 --> 05:10.660]  And then I'll come back into my office, like, four hours later,
[05:10.840 --> 05:12.420]  and the thing is just on the floor.
[05:13.460 --> 05:15.280]  So my printer's just embarrassed.
[05:16.340 --> 05:17.860]  It doesn't want to print in front of me.
[05:17.980 --> 05:20.020]  I've never seen it print.
[05:21.340 --> 05:23.120]  Dude, dude, you have a shy printer.
[05:23.300 --> 05:27.040]  I dated a girl in the army who was the same way with eating.
[05:27.240 --> 05:29.620]  She wouldn't eat in front of me. She'd go to, like, Burger King,
[05:29.720 --> 05:32.660]  and she would wait till I'd look away, and then she'd take, like, a rabbit bite,
[05:32.760 --> 05:34.020]  and then, like, freeze up again.
[05:34.020 --> 05:36.800]  Or I'd go to the bathroom, and I'd come back, and she'd be going to town.
[05:36.920 --> 05:38.340]  She just, like, wouldn't eat in front of me.
[05:38.560 --> 05:42.340]  Your printer is... you gotta sit down and have a conversation with your printer.
[05:43.280 --> 05:43.920]  I'm actually...
[05:43.920 --> 05:45.300]  You gotta put it at ease.
[05:45.780 --> 05:47.840]  I'm not even joking when I said I wanted to...
[05:47.840 --> 05:50.360]  when I thought I wanted to set up a camera to catch it printing.
[05:50.520 --> 05:53.560]  It will never do it. I could ask it to print,
[05:53.900 --> 05:56.960]  and I'll sit in the room with it for three hours, and it knows when I've left.
[05:57.220 --> 05:59.480]  Dude, what if you ask it to print right now,
[05:59.540 --> 06:01.420]  and then we'll just see if it does before the end of the episode?
[06:01.420 --> 06:03.180]  I love it.
[06:03.280 --> 06:04.160]  Let me print.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  Can I give you something to print? Yeah.
[06:07.580 --> 06:08.980]  Print the Chubby logo.
[06:09.900 --> 06:11.920]  Printing the Chubby logo.
[06:12.980 --> 06:14.820]  Look at how happy Chubby guy is.
[06:14.940 --> 06:16.500]  So we're just wasting ink, then, huh?
[06:16.900 --> 06:18.000]  No, this is great.
[06:18.300 --> 06:19.820]  Every fucking color on Earth.
[06:20.740 --> 06:22.940]  Chubby. Jeff has that tattooed somewhere on his body.
[06:24.280 --> 06:24.800]  Hey.
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.820]  Hey, don't tempt me.
[06:26.820 --> 06:27.660]  I got one.
[06:29.440 --> 06:31.240]  I'd love for you to have a Chubby tattoo.
[06:31.600 --> 06:32.820]  I haven't had a tattoo in a while.
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.320]  I don't really think about them very much anymore.
[06:35.680 --> 06:38.200]  I wish I had more, but that whole part of getting them is annoying.
[06:39.040 --> 06:43.080]  Barrier to entry stuff, kind of like parasailing or whatever we were talking about.
[06:43.240 --> 06:45.700]  Your pictures can't be printed because this error occurred.
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.200]  An internal error occurred.
[06:48.480 --> 06:48.880]  Okay.
[06:49.760 --> 06:51.740]  The internal error is your present.
[06:53.860 --> 06:54.260]  Huh.
[06:54.260 --> 06:58.500]  That is a different error than I've got before.
[06:59.120 --> 07:03.100]  I will say, I could see it being a Chubby issue.
[07:03.900 --> 07:07.460]  Because I don't think there's anything official about the Chubby branding at this point.
[07:07.980 --> 07:10.060]  Now, I'm not familiar with Chubby.
[07:11.180 --> 07:11.900]  Oh my God.
[07:12.300 --> 07:16.160]  It's just error screen on top of error screen when Gavin tries to print this.
[07:16.200 --> 07:16.920]  Yeah, that is unfortunate.
[07:17.980 --> 07:19.400]  Have you tried printing the law?
[07:20.140 --> 07:20.800]  It goes great.
[07:21.360 --> 07:21.520]  No.
[07:22.440 --> 07:24.420]  Try not printing it full screen.
[07:24.780 --> 07:27.960]  Try printing it smaller. Maybe that will help.
[07:29.180 --> 07:30.800]  What were you going to say, Jeff, about Chubby?
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.440]  I'm just not familiar with Chubby as a brand.
[07:33.540 --> 07:35.200]  Is that a Canadian thing?
[07:35.600 --> 07:38.420]  Brand of soda from Trinidad and Tobago.
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.120]  Oh.
[07:40.640 --> 07:43.940]  It used to be in Canada. Now it's only available in the United States.
[07:44.520 --> 07:46.240]  At Walmart, specifically.
[07:46.820 --> 07:50.540]  We were talking about it when we were in between recordings.
[07:50.540 --> 07:52.240]  He had asked if I'd ever had those.
[07:52.380 --> 07:53.300]  And I said, no.
[07:53.800 --> 07:55.580]  The ones that I remember, it's these.
[07:55.740 --> 07:58.300]  These cheap-ass little nothing drinks.
[07:58.300 --> 07:59.560]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[07:59.560 --> 08:00.840]  The little barrels?
[08:01.160 --> 08:03.700]  I don't even know what they're called.
[08:04.040 --> 08:08.680]  I just searched, like, plastic cheap drink 1990s.
[08:09.460 --> 08:11.380]  Yeah, those things are fucking great, dude.
[08:12.100 --> 08:14.160]  What are the flavors?
[08:14.740 --> 08:16.560]  Red, orange, blue.
[08:16.560 --> 08:17.400]  There's a purple, blue.
[08:17.400 --> 08:19.160]  There's a green flavor.
[08:19.640 --> 08:21.140]  I think that's it.
[08:21.320 --> 08:22.460]  Don't know what they're called.
[08:22.680 --> 08:24.240]  They're, like, shaped like little barrels.
[08:24.740 --> 08:26.580]  You would never guess what they were called.
[08:26.940 --> 08:28.660]  What a ridiculous name for these.
[08:28.760 --> 08:29.240]  What is it?
[08:30.140 --> 08:31.300]  Little Hugs.
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.620]  Fuck you.
[08:33.960 --> 08:35.280]  Little Hugs Fruit Barrels.
[08:37.200 --> 08:38.580]  Motherfucker. That is what they're called.
[08:39.160 --> 08:40.060]  Fruit Barrels.
[08:40.180 --> 08:41.440]  Little Hugs.
[08:42.960 --> 08:45.520]  They were, like, a quarter.
[08:45.520 --> 08:47.100]  They were so cheap.
[08:47.200 --> 08:49.520]  So, Chubby has...
[08:50.580 --> 08:51.540]  Pineapple Sunshine,
[08:52.460 --> 08:53.420]  Cream Scream,
[08:53.760 --> 08:55.240]  Orange Tango,
[08:55.560 --> 08:56.740]  or Tangy, whatever it is.
[08:57.420 --> 08:59.000]  Tutti Frutti, Purple Power,
[08:59.260 --> 09:00.580]  and Blueberry Blast.
[09:00.740 --> 09:03.800]  You can get, like, a little six-pack of all the different flavors.
[09:04.500 --> 09:06.620]  I feel like we should get some of those.
[09:07.800 --> 09:09.960]  I feel like they're discontinued, sadly.
[09:10.140 --> 09:11.020]  The Chubbies aren't.
[09:11.700 --> 09:13.260]  Gavin, did you guys have a weird little drink?
[09:13.260 --> 09:14.500]  I thought we were talking Little Hugs.
[09:14.700 --> 09:16.180]  I had Panda Pops.
[09:17.660 --> 09:20.440]  They were probably the littlest drinks that I had.
[09:21.240 --> 09:22.780]  The littlest drinks.
[09:24.460 --> 09:25.580]  Is it...
[09:25.580 --> 09:26.600]  Hang on. Is it these?
[09:27.600 --> 09:29.460]  Oh, I remember them being smaller than...
[09:30.420 --> 09:31.240]  than that.
[09:32.420 --> 09:33.640]  Was that Panda Pop?
[09:34.180 --> 09:35.020]  I have no idea.
[09:35.480 --> 09:36.640]  I don't know.
[09:39.080 --> 09:39.640]  Panda...
[09:39.640 --> 09:40.000]  Pops.
[09:40.000 --> 09:40.960]  I hated them.
[09:41.060 --> 09:43.480]  I didn't really like fizzy drinks.
[09:47.440 --> 09:49.040]  This guy's too wrapped up in his printer, man.
[09:49.120 --> 09:50.040]  I don't know about this.
[09:50.520 --> 09:52.700]  Do you guys remember these?
[09:52.820 --> 09:55.340]  I was thinking about these the other day, and I was going to ask...
[09:55.340 --> 09:55.720]  Oh, wow.
[09:55.880 --> 09:57.720]  Did they exist in Canada, Andrew?
[09:57.820 --> 10:00.680]  Or is this like an Outback Steakhouse kind of thing?
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.740]  I feel like that is an Outback Steakhouse thing.
[10:03.800 --> 10:05.620]  I have no memory of Clearly Canadian.
[10:06.020 --> 10:06.760]  That's really funny.
[10:06.760 --> 10:08.840]  In the 80s, they were everywhere.
[10:09.140 --> 10:09.840]  Dude, yeah, that...
[10:09.840 --> 10:12.120]  That must have gone right up until about
[10:12.820 --> 10:13.260]  1992.
[10:14.920 --> 10:16.740]  It feels like so early 90s,
[10:16.740 --> 10:17.780]  and they were gone.
[10:18.180 --> 10:18.840]  That's crazy.
[10:19.400 --> 10:22.160]  Why was Clearly Canadian discontinued?
[10:22.340 --> 10:23.580]  Poor management decisions.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.200]  Found it in 87,
[10:26.620 --> 10:27.520]  in British Columbia.
[10:28.280 --> 10:28.960]  Oh, there you go.
[10:29.660 --> 10:30.840]  It was a little before your time, I guess.
[10:31.300 --> 10:32.200]  I guess so.
[10:32.200 --> 10:33.320]  You should...
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.860]  If you can find some, you should get some.
[10:35.200 --> 10:37.380]  In 1993, their annual sales hit $155 million.
[10:38.060 --> 10:38.360]  Jesus.
[10:39.380 --> 10:40.680]  I'm learning all about Little Hug.
[10:40.740 --> 10:42.400]  They also have Big Hug branded.
[10:42.940 --> 10:44.560]  It's the same product, but they're bigger.
[10:44.860 --> 10:47.520]  Oh, that's awful. You should not have a bigger...
[10:47.520 --> 10:48.780]  A bigger taste of happiness.
[10:49.620 --> 10:51.340]  It's just sugar.
[10:51.520 --> 10:52.640]  It's like hummingbird food.
[10:52.920 --> 10:56.580]  They sold it in 2015,
[10:57.000 --> 10:57.880]  I believe it said,
[10:57.960 --> 10:59.960]  and they reduced the sugar content.
[10:59.960 --> 11:01.500]  I don't believe you.
[11:01.620 --> 11:04.300]  But a million reduced to 900,000
[11:04.300 --> 11:05.160]  is still too much.
[11:06.620 --> 11:07.880]  Dude, it's fucking
[11:07.880 --> 11:09.920]  shitting down rain outside my house right now.
[11:09.940 --> 11:11.640]  It started.
[11:12.040 --> 11:13.060]  Just started, yeah.
[11:13.420 --> 11:14.320]  It's Big Hug.
[11:16.680 --> 11:17.600]  Did you have...
[11:17.600 --> 11:19.420]  Jeff, I feel like this is after
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.900]  your time, but before probably everyone
[11:21.900 --> 11:24.040]  else's here. Did you guys have Raven's
[11:24.040 --> 11:24.540]  Revenge?
[11:25.040 --> 11:26.940]  I have never seen that in my life.
[11:26.940 --> 11:27.960]  I figured.
[11:28.640 --> 11:29.920]  Is that food?
[11:30.660 --> 11:32.020]  Is that like a fruit roller?
[11:32.780 --> 11:33.680]  No, no, no, no.
[11:34.700 --> 11:37.220]  It's like sugar
[11:37.220 --> 11:37.880]  dust.
[11:38.760 --> 11:39.920]  Like pixie sticks?
[11:40.460 --> 11:41.260]  Kind of.
[11:42.740 --> 11:44.780]  But like, you would
[11:44.780 --> 11:46.940]  go to the little Raven's Revenge
[11:46.940 --> 11:47.980]  station thing and you would
[11:48.500 --> 11:50.600]  layer it with different flavors. Some of them were
[11:50.600 --> 11:52.420]  really sour and some of them weren't, whatever.
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.040]  So you make your own layers.
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.580]  Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:55.620 --> 11:57.820]  So you would make cool designs and then show your friends
[11:57.820 --> 11:59.880]  and then you would all just be in
[11:59.880 --> 12:01.900]  sixth grade eating nothing but
[12:01.900 --> 12:02.340]  sugar.
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.060]  It looks like something you would put in a letter
[12:06.060 --> 12:07.940]  to assassinate the president with.
[12:08.360 --> 12:09.940]  That does not look like
[12:09.940 --> 12:10.940]  edible food.
[12:11.720 --> 12:12.600]  Yes, I agree.
[12:13.280 --> 12:15.940]  It's like something Ted Kaczynski would send to a college professor.
[12:17.680 --> 12:19.460]  We were inspired, you know?
[12:19.460 --> 12:22.280]  Yeah, that sums up
[12:22.280 --> 12:23.400]  the 90s, actually, now that you mention it.
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.500]  I'm surprised this generation has teeth.
[12:26.400 --> 12:27.600]  Yeah, some of us don't.
[12:27.940 --> 12:29.600]  Especially with what Nick is throwing down there
[12:29.600 --> 12:31.660]  with Fun Dip. Dude, we had Fun Dip in the
[12:31.660 --> 12:33.680]  office up until us going out of business.
[12:34.240 --> 12:35.460]  Fun Dip in an office!
[12:36.280 --> 12:37.080]  That's crazy.
[12:38.280 --> 12:39.640]  I've never had Fun Dip,
[12:39.780 --> 12:40.860]  but I've seen it a lot.
[12:41.480 --> 12:42.580]  Is Fun Dip good?
[12:42.900 --> 12:45.320]  The stick is the best thing on Earth.
[12:45.420 --> 12:47.080]  I wish I could just buy the stick.
[12:47.080 --> 12:48.340]  If I could buy like a
[12:49.040 --> 12:50.840]  six pack of sticks, like a stick pack,
[12:51.980 --> 12:52.740]  it's all I'd eat.
[12:53.520 --> 12:55.160]  Dude, what a power
[12:55.160 --> 12:56.760]  move it would be to
[12:56.760 --> 12:59.280]  just pull the stick out of a bag of Fun Dip
[12:59.280 --> 13:00.620]  and toss the bag out.
[13:00.760 --> 13:02.100]  I do that all the time. What are you talking about?
[13:02.740 --> 13:04.120]  It's a ball of moon.
[13:04.140 --> 13:07.320]  Wait, the stick is edible? Yeah, it's the best part.
[13:07.840 --> 13:08.200]  Oh.
[13:09.100 --> 13:10.900]  I always assumed it was just like a spoon.
[13:11.360 --> 13:12.560]  So it's flavored
[13:14.060 --> 13:14.780]  like powder
[13:15.340 --> 13:17.020]  and then when you're done
[13:17.020 --> 13:18.280]  with the flavored powder,
[13:18.920 --> 13:20.440]  the stick is just
[13:20.440 --> 13:22.140]  super pressed sugar
[13:22.140 --> 13:25.020]  that doesn't have like a flavor except sugar.
[13:25.240 --> 13:26.760]  It is sugar dipping in sugar
[13:26.760 --> 13:27.960]  and then you eat all of it.
[13:28.300 --> 13:30.480]  Yeah, it's a white flavor. That's how I would describe it.
[13:30.580 --> 13:31.000]  It tastes white.
[13:31.940 --> 13:34.820]  What was the best flavor of
[13:34.820 --> 13:35.600]  Fruit Barrel?
[13:36.380 --> 13:36.600]  Red.
[13:38.500 --> 13:40.500]  Red or blue probably.
[13:40.820 --> 13:42.780]  Those were like...
[13:42.780 --> 13:44.840]  This website has orange
[13:44.840 --> 13:46.820]  and purple. The only ones
[13:46.820 --> 13:48.700]  they have. It's because they're the only ones
[13:48.700 --> 13:50.700]  left because nobody drank them. Yeah, because those
[13:50.700 --> 13:52.300]  aren't the good ones. Yeah.
[13:53.120 --> 13:54.560]  God damn it. Okay, I'll look into this.
[13:54.620 --> 13:56.780]  I want to try those because I feel like those are things
[13:56.780 --> 13:58.640]  I've only seen in movies or like TV.
[13:58.840 --> 14:00.660]  Like they suck, like they're not good.
[14:01.300 --> 14:01.700]  You know?
[14:03.100 --> 14:04.900]  Speaking of shit, bad
[14:04.900 --> 14:06.720]  candy, do you remember Wax
[14:06.720 --> 14:08.800]  Cola? I think I know what you're
[14:08.800 --> 14:10.680]  talking about, but not that as a brand.
[14:11.400 --> 14:12.200]  Oh God.
[14:12.620 --> 14:14.560]  Is it the drinks where you
[14:14.560 --> 14:16.600]  bite the top? Wax bottles.
[14:16.860 --> 14:18.960]  Yeah. But they're so small
[14:18.960 --> 14:20.440]  like I didn't really understand.
[14:20.460 --> 14:22.640]  I know, that's why they suck. You were supposed
[14:22.640 --> 14:24.580]  to like bite the top and then like drink them
[14:24.580 --> 14:26.520]  and then throw out the wax or chew on the wax?
[14:26.600 --> 14:28.720]  What was the plan with the wax? You chew on the wax.
[14:29.220 --> 14:30.700]  Yeah. Who wants to chew
[14:30.700 --> 14:32.680]  wax? I would put the whole
[14:32.680 --> 14:34.720]  bottle in my mouth at one time and just
[14:34.720 --> 14:36.560]  start chewing. That's what you mostly did.
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.700]  Yeah, until the flavor was gone and you spit it out.
[14:38.700 --> 14:40.200]  Yeah. Yeah, they're small.
[14:40.540 --> 14:42.180]  Oh, I thought they were like full bottle size.
[14:44.240 --> 14:46.500]  Like a giant candle
[14:46.500 --> 14:48.300]  bottle. That would be
[14:48.300 --> 14:50.480]  crazy. Just like walking around
[14:50.480 --> 14:52.300]  chewing on a giant ass candle.
[14:53.800 --> 14:54.680]  That's exactly
[14:54.680 --> 14:55.760]  what I thought you were talking about.
[14:56.120 --> 14:58.520]  I want that now. That needs to be a thing
[14:58.520 --> 15:00.560]  that exists. I'm sure you could make that.
[15:00.700 --> 15:02.320]  What kind of wax is chewable?
[15:03.000 --> 15:04.680]  Listen, I'm already fucking...
[15:04.680 --> 15:06.280]  I'm doing pickling already.
[15:06.280 --> 15:08.280]  I don't have time to figure out how to make a
[15:08.280 --> 15:09.960]  wax bottle on top of the pickling.
[15:10.220 --> 15:12.280]  Then you gotta get into industrial glycine,
[15:12.880 --> 15:14.160]  start adding that in. It's a whole thing.
[15:16.460 --> 15:18.300]  It would be so funny to just
[15:18.300 --> 15:20.260]  bite the top off a soda bottle
[15:20.260 --> 15:21.880]  and drink it and then just eat the bottle.
[15:24.360 --> 15:26.440]  Like a Coke product type thing?
[15:26.600 --> 15:27.360]  Like real soda?
[15:28.060 --> 15:30.220]  Because I don't even know what the liquid is
[15:30.220 --> 15:32.400]  in the wax bottles because it's certainly not
[15:32.400 --> 15:33.120]  soda.
[15:34.020 --> 15:35.140]  It's like a juice?
[15:35.320 --> 15:36.200]  I guess a fruit juice?
[15:36.780 --> 15:38.000]  I'd describe it as...
[15:38.000 --> 15:38.700]  Yeah, in quotes.
[15:41.200 --> 15:43.300]  Did anybody else answer
[15:43.300 --> 15:44.980]  what the grossest food they eat is?
[15:46.300 --> 15:47.060]  Oh, no.
[15:47.220 --> 15:47.960]  I'm trying to...
[15:47.960 --> 15:49.560]  I don't really have one for fruit.
[15:49.920 --> 15:51.800]  Sticking in the beverage realm,
[15:52.340 --> 15:54.740]  I really like the taste of Dasani water
[15:54.740 --> 15:56.860]  and I feel like that just makes me a scumbag.
[15:56.960 --> 15:57.660]  You're a monster.
[15:57.900 --> 15:58.600]  That's crazy.
[15:59.200 --> 16:00.780]  That's the grossest...
[16:00.780 --> 16:02.240]  It's like drinking an oil slick.
[16:02.540 --> 16:04.800]  I know. Everyone says that.
[16:04.920 --> 16:05.500]  I like it.
[16:05.940 --> 16:08.000]  I think it was banned in England.
[16:09.140 --> 16:09.660]  Probably.
[16:11.220 --> 16:12.260]  It's a shit bottled water.
[16:12.360 --> 16:14.100]  I think it's like the worst bottled water brand.
[16:14.800 --> 16:16.540]  Somehow you drink it
[16:16.540 --> 16:18.280]  and you're like less hydrated.
[16:18.760 --> 16:20.520]  I don't know how it happens.
[16:20.780 --> 16:22.260]  It's like the Tuxedo.
[16:22.260 --> 16:22.400]  Tuxedo.
[16:28.960 --> 16:31.460]  Nick eats sardines with jalapenos
[16:31.460 --> 16:32.320]  in hot sauce?
[16:33.920 --> 16:36.080]  It's like a...
[16:36.080 --> 16:36.980]  On what?
[16:37.220 --> 16:37.940]  Like just a bowl?
[16:39.040 --> 16:40.980]  Like a bowl of fish and peppers
[16:40.980 --> 16:41.720]  in hot sauce?
[16:42.660 --> 16:45.460]  This man is absolutely drinking fish stock
[16:45.460 --> 16:46.860]  on the side out of cans.
[16:47.560 --> 16:48.260]  I can't be stopped.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.260]  What does that look like?
[16:51.260 --> 16:51.780]  Gross.
[16:53.440 --> 16:55.180]  Nick, can you name
[16:55.180 --> 16:56.440]  on one hand
[16:56.440 --> 16:58.880]  the number of food you don't like
[16:58.880 --> 17:00.080]  that you wouldn't eat?
[17:00.660 --> 17:01.500]  Yeah, probably.
[17:01.740 --> 17:02.480]  What would you avoid?
[17:03.560 --> 17:05.780]  We ran into that issue earlier
[17:05.780 --> 17:08.160]  in the other show where I was trying to remember
[17:08.160 --> 17:10.060]  something I didn't like off the top of my head.
[17:10.960 --> 17:12.520]  I'd say the thing I don't like
[17:12.520 --> 17:14.400]  the most or would probably
[17:14.400 --> 17:15.560]  avoid is coconut.
[17:16.740 --> 17:17.820]  Yeah, that was
[17:18.380 --> 17:19.180]  a weird
[17:20.220 --> 17:20.620]  dislike.
[17:21.820 --> 17:23.860]  I didn't mean you're weird as in you're weird
[17:23.860 --> 17:25.300]  as a person. I meant of your
[17:25.820 --> 17:27.920]  taste preferences. Of all the things for you not to like,
[17:28.000 --> 17:29.140]  coconut seems like a weird one.
[17:29.420 --> 17:30.780]  It might be the texture, I don't know.
[17:31.360 --> 17:33.600]  A lot of people don't like it. What about in chocolate form?
[17:33.700 --> 17:34.240]  Like a bounty?
[17:36.100 --> 17:36.500]  Mound?
[17:37.080 --> 17:39.340]  No, I can't do it.
[17:40.180 --> 17:40.980]  Why ruin good chocolate?
[17:41.120 --> 17:43.680]  Nick has that dog in him, not in the sense of
[17:44.160 --> 17:45.760]  not quitting, but he'll just
[17:45.760 --> 17:47.400]  eat whatever the fuck you put in front of him.
[17:47.660 --> 17:49.480]  Yeah, I mean, I'll slop it up, really.
[17:50.020 --> 17:51.680]  Yeah, I mean, you guys are getting
[17:51.680 --> 17:53.640]  a better glimpse at what he is on the other show.
[17:53.700 --> 17:55.720]  On 100% Eat, it's just this all the time.
[17:55.900 --> 17:56.720]  Yeah, kinda.
[17:57.020 --> 17:59.720]  You know, Gav, you'll slop
[17:59.720 --> 18:01.340]  a lot of stuff up too in the grand scheme of things.
[18:01.420 --> 18:03.660]  You're not into sugary candies
[18:03.660 --> 18:05.120]  and like food
[18:05.700 --> 18:07.520]  that was created in a lab, but
[18:07.520 --> 18:09.700]  I remember touring Scotland and England
[18:09.700 --> 18:11.900]  with you and you ate haggis and all kinds of nasty
[18:11.900 --> 18:12.220]  shit.
[18:12.220 --> 18:13.220]  Haggis is delicious.
[18:13.460 --> 18:16.040]  That was mainly trying stuff. I still didn't eat that
[18:16.040 --> 18:18.100]  raw meat that you ate in the Netherlands.
[18:18.780 --> 18:19.180]  Oh!
[18:20.040 --> 18:20.840]  Raw meat?
[18:22.820 --> 18:23.860]  I'm convinced of
[18:23.860 --> 18:25.640]  the way it was pranking you with that shit.
[18:26.260 --> 18:28.200]  Yeah, and he totally might
[18:28.200 --> 18:29.800]  have been, but we still
[18:29.800 --> 18:31.380]  ate it. It was not good.
[18:32.960 --> 18:33.760]  It was like,
[18:34.420 --> 18:35.260]  it was like, what is it?
[18:35.580 --> 18:37.620]  I don't ever eat it, but what is that raw meat?
[18:38.180 --> 18:40.120]  It's always an appetizer. What's it called?
[18:40.120 --> 18:41.260]  Steak tartare?
[18:41.320 --> 18:44.060]  It was like tartare shoved into
[18:44.060 --> 18:44.500]  these
[18:45.940 --> 18:46.260]  pickled
[18:47.720 --> 18:48.360]  peppers.
[18:48.900 --> 18:51.820]  And then you would just like, pop it in your mouth
[18:51.820 --> 18:54.080]  and it was like an explosion of raw meat
[18:54.080 --> 18:55.960]  and juice and blood.
[18:56.800 --> 18:57.760]  I tried it.
[18:58.680 --> 18:58.800]  Yeah.
[18:59.480 --> 19:00.680]  It wasn't great.
[19:01.860 --> 19:03.120]  Aust first.
[19:07.640 --> 19:08.680]  I lost him.
[19:09.160 --> 19:10.420]  Did Geoff lose power?
[19:10.420 --> 19:10.820]  Uh oh.
[19:12.780 --> 19:14.800]  Just so you guys know,
[19:14.860 --> 19:16.660]  we've been recording for the last few hours.
[19:17.260 --> 19:18.500]  If we're keeping this in.
[19:18.920 --> 19:20.540]  We've been recording for the last few hours
[19:20.540 --> 19:22.780]  and over probably the last, I'd say 45 minutes
[19:22.780 --> 19:23.320]  to an hour,
[19:24.140 --> 19:26.700]  the weather has turned insane.
[19:27.040 --> 19:28.280]  It was sunny and bright.
[19:28.360 --> 19:29.760]  I mowed my lawn this morning.
[19:30.220 --> 19:31.180]  It was nice out.
[19:31.700 --> 19:32.820]  I'm in the dark.
[19:33.040 --> 19:36.340]  It's so dark. It's almost 4.
[19:36.740 --> 19:37.720]  It is raining
[19:37.720 --> 19:39.300]  so hard.
[19:39.780 --> 19:41.740]  And I bet, I don't know if Geoff
[19:41.740 --> 19:43.740]  just lost power, but I got a feeling
[19:43.740 --> 19:46.020]  he did. Do we think that Geoff
[19:46.020 --> 19:47.540]  is a
[19:47.540 --> 19:49.100]  UPS guy? Nope.
[19:51.040 --> 19:51.600]  UPS?
[19:52.140 --> 19:53.180]  Like the battery?
[19:53.880 --> 19:55.120]  Yeah, like the backup battery.
[19:55.920 --> 19:57.640]  No. Absolutely
[19:57.640 --> 19:59.880]  not. So, Andrew, the thing
[19:59.880 --> 20:01.720]  that I learned starting to work at
[20:01.720 --> 20:03.700]  Rooster Teeth was
[20:04.260 --> 20:05.060]  Was that thunder?
[20:05.060 --> 20:07.240]  That sounded like thunder.
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.140]  I heard that through Discord.
[20:09.740 --> 20:10.280]  That's cool.
[20:11.140 --> 20:13.160]  Everything's crackling when the lightning strikes.
[20:15.780 --> 20:16.940]  The thing I learned
[20:16.940 --> 20:19.020]  when I started working at Rooster Teeth is that
[20:19.020 --> 20:21.120]  they are religious about their backup
[20:21.120 --> 20:23.180]  batteries, both at the office and at home.
[20:23.840 --> 20:25.120]  I never had run
[20:25.120 --> 20:26.620]  into that until I started working there.
[20:26.900 --> 20:28.560]  So many people have backups. It's really crazy.
[20:28.560 --> 20:29.620]  I got like five of them.
[20:31.740 --> 20:33.040]  I have none.
[20:33.040 --> 20:35.060]  My power goes out, and I just go, I guess that's it.
[20:35.540 --> 20:36.280]  I have a
[20:37.140 --> 20:38.920]  server that spins up
[20:38.920 --> 20:41.200]  60 drives, and I'm so paranoid about
[20:41.940 --> 20:43.260]  a multiple drive
[20:43.260 --> 20:45.280]  head crash if the power goes out, so I've got
[20:45.280 --> 20:47.300]  a dual-layer UPS
[20:47.300 --> 20:47.800]  for it.
[20:48.880 --> 20:50.680]  Oh, wow. You're set.
[20:51.200 --> 20:51.980]  There he goes.
[20:52.860 --> 20:55.080]  I haven't heard back from Geoff yet. I texted him
[20:55.080 --> 20:56.860]  to see what's up, but I haven't heard back from him.
[20:56.980 --> 20:58.480]  When I worked at an IT place,
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.020]  we had to do tape backups for
[21:01.020 --> 21:02.720]  servers. Did you ever do that stuff?
[21:03.080 --> 21:03.780]  Yeah, I got tapes.
[21:04.300 --> 21:06.020]  Jeez, man, that stuff's crazy.
[21:06.260 --> 21:07.340]  Alright, I'm back.
[21:07.640 --> 21:08.320]  What happened?
[21:08.800 --> 21:12.040]  No, my power didn't go out.
[21:12.100 --> 21:14.960]  My router just turned
[21:14.960 --> 21:15.620]  off, I guess.
[21:16.980 --> 21:19.220]  I must have had a
[21:19.220 --> 21:19.700]  surge or something.
[21:20.420 --> 21:21.740]  So you're still recording?
[21:22.140 --> 21:22.900]  Yeah, I never stopped.
[21:24.200 --> 21:26.920]  I'm a fucking professional, dude.
[21:27.440 --> 21:28.640]  Are you a backup battery guy?
[21:29.740 --> 21:30.180]  No.
[21:30.500 --> 21:34.260]  No, but I never have been.
[21:34.800 --> 21:35.920]  Oh, that is fine.
[21:36.840 --> 21:37.660]  There you go.
[21:38.420 --> 21:40.700]  I know you are, Gav, but is everybody else?
[21:41.420 --> 21:41.720]  No.
[21:42.920 --> 21:44.940]  I'm a glow stick and candle guy.
[21:45.700 --> 21:46.200]  If I was a
[21:46.200 --> 21:48.700]  backup battery guy, then that would just
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.540]  mean that I would be indignant and annoyed
[21:50.540 --> 21:52.760]  when I didn't lose my audio and everybody else did.
[21:53.320 --> 21:54.640]  This way, I'm a part of the group that loses
[21:54.640 --> 21:55.040]  the audio.
[22:00.980 --> 22:01.960]  Oh, shit.
[22:02.100 --> 22:03.220]  It's pissing it down.
[22:03.760 --> 22:06.220]  I'm jealous. I'd go to sleep.
[22:06.680 --> 22:08.300]  Does it make you sleepy, especially in that chair?
[22:08.300 --> 22:10.220]  Yeah, with the chair
[22:10.220 --> 22:11.820]  and I listen to the rain sounds while I sleep.
[22:12.640 --> 22:14.760]  What did I miss while I was gone, by the way?
[22:14.900 --> 22:16.220]  We were just talking about batteries.
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.500]  Andrew, do you think you'll
[22:18.500 --> 22:20.040]  learn your chair before the next episode?
[22:20.940 --> 22:22.660]  No, I've never learned a chair.
[22:22.800 --> 22:23.040]  Ever.
[22:23.960 --> 22:26.560]  You spend so much time in your office chair
[22:26.560 --> 22:28.780]  that I want to know without even looking
[22:28.780 --> 22:29.900]  what all my knobs do.
[22:31.160 --> 22:32.260]  I just get intimidated.
[22:33.700 --> 22:35.000]  Because what if I flip
[22:35.000 --> 22:36.860]  the thing and it changes and I don't know how
[22:36.860 --> 22:38.900]  to change back? Just remember what you did.
[22:39.000 --> 22:40.940]  Just do the reverse of what you just did.
[22:41.160 --> 22:42.940]  Yeah, but I didn't know what I did in the first
[22:42.940 --> 22:44.820]  place, so how do I reverse what I didn't know?
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.800]  Not freaking Rubik's Cube.
[22:47.200 --> 22:48.820]  Film it. Film yourself doing it
[22:48.820 --> 22:51.020]  so you can go back and watch the tape. It's a chair,
[22:51.140 --> 22:52.320]  man! And you got
[22:53.360 --> 22:54.160]  the chair.
[22:54.540 --> 22:57.120]  If you were ever to learn a chair
[22:57.120 --> 22:59.300]  to maximize your comfort,
[22:59.720 --> 23:00.900]  this would be the chair.
[23:01.320 --> 23:03.320]  You're right. I need to fully utilize this chair.
[23:03.500 --> 23:05.120]  I will put an effort in to learn
[23:05.120 --> 23:07.000]  all these buttons and switches and
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.080]  knobs. We've got a couple of weeks before we can
[23:09.080 --> 23:10.240]  record again.
[23:10.980 --> 23:13.260]  Exactly, Gavin. You should be like
[23:13.260 --> 23:14.940]  fucking Tank in the Matrix,
[23:15.180 --> 23:16.240]  all laid out,
[23:17.220 --> 23:19.160]  just coding like crazy.
[23:19.280 --> 23:19.800]  Coding comedy.
[23:20.740 --> 23:23.120]  I need to. I think that
[23:23.120 --> 23:25.120]  by the time you're
[23:25.120 --> 23:26.980]  back, by the time we're back together,
[23:27.720 --> 23:29.060]  you should at least be able to
[23:29.060 --> 23:31.380]  show us a couple of tricks that you learned
[23:31.380 --> 23:32.900]  about your chair.
[23:32.960 --> 23:33.460]  You got it.
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.100]  This episode is brought to you by
[23:37.100 --> 23:39.200]  State Farm. Checking off the boxes
[23:39.200 --> 23:40.980]  on your to-do list is a great
[23:40.980 --> 23:43.200]  feeling. And when it comes to checking off
[23:43.200 --> 23:45.080]  coverage, a State Farm agent can
[23:45.080 --> 23:47.140]  help you choose an option that's right for you.
[23:47.320 --> 23:49.060]  Whether you prefer talking in person,
[23:49.240 --> 23:51.160]  on the phone, or using the award-winning
[23:51.160 --> 23:53.000]  app, it's nice knowing you have
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.360]  help finding coverage that best fits your needs.
[23:55.740 --> 23:57.180]  Like a good neighbor? State Farm
[23:57.180 --> 23:57.620]  is there.
[24:00.220 --> 24:01.080]  This summer,
[24:01.320 --> 24:02.980]  try the new Strato Frappuccino blended
[24:02.980 --> 24:05.220]  beverage at Starbucks. It's the classic
[24:05.220 --> 24:07.240]  blended iced coffee you know and love,
[24:07.400 --> 24:09.080]  now topped with a creamy layer of
[24:09.080 --> 24:10.920]  handcrafted brown sugar cold foam.
[24:11.300 --> 24:12.800]  Available for a limited time.
[24:13.040 --> 24:15.180]  Your Strato Frappuccino is ready at Starbucks.
[24:15.420 --> 24:17.040]  If everyone here was a Matrix character,
[24:17.180 --> 24:17.680]  who would you be?
[24:19.160 --> 24:19.680]  Neo.
[24:19.680 --> 24:19.840]  Neo.
[24:22.440 --> 24:23.060]  Yeah, man.
[24:27.380 --> 24:29.760]  I'd be Roy Jones Jr. character, I don't remember his name.
[24:30.980 --> 24:31.240]  Who?
[24:31.840 --> 24:33.240]  Roy Jones Jr.?
[24:33.240 --> 24:34.180]  He was in the Matrix.
[24:35.400 --> 24:36.580]  I don't remember that.
[24:37.000 --> 24:37.640]  Who was he in the Matrix?
[24:38.640 --> 24:40.040]  I don't remember his name, let me look it up.
[24:40.040 --> 24:41.100]  What was the character then, what did he do?
[24:44.820 --> 24:46.520]  Jeff just wants to be Roy Jones Jr.
[24:46.740 --> 24:47.800]  He was one of the dudes.
[24:48.620 --> 24:49.980]  Who was a good guy?
[24:50.140 --> 24:52.120]  I'd be the guy that says I want to eat steak.
[24:52.440 --> 24:53.280]  No way, baby.
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.540]  I'm Joey Pants.
[24:54.620 --> 24:55.680]  I'm Cipher.
[24:57.700 --> 24:59.220]  Hey, ignorance is bliss.
[24:59.960 --> 25:02.080]  That steak looks...
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.060]  Every time I watch that scene, I really
[25:04.060 --> 25:05.520]  want steak. It just looks so good.
[25:06.100 --> 25:07.640]  And the way he eats it is so weird.
[25:07.740 --> 25:09.880]  They nailed that scene. It makes you...
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.080]  Like, you watch that scene and it makes you realize
[25:12.080 --> 25:13.820]  like, look, I don't
[25:13.820 --> 25:15.820]  agree with what this guy is saying, but
[25:15.820 --> 25:17.640]  boy, that is just
[25:17.640 --> 25:19.820]  everything to him and it looks phenomenal.
[25:20.140 --> 25:21.960]  But if you were him, I feel
[25:21.960 --> 25:23.740]  like if I was in his situation, I would think
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.620]  exactly like him. Like, Morpheus just keeps
[25:25.620 --> 25:27.220]  killing people. He keeps
[25:27.820 --> 25:29.900]  pulling people out of the Matrix and they keep dying.
[25:30.600 --> 25:30.700]  Right.
[25:31.080 --> 25:33.880]  It was Ballard. That's who I'd be.
[25:34.620 --> 25:35.100]  Okay.
[25:37.240 --> 25:37.760]  I have
[25:37.760 --> 25:39.780]  no idea who Roy Jones Jr. was in.
[25:40.640 --> 25:41.320]  Hell yeah he was.
[25:42.420 --> 25:43.960]  Why was Roy Jones
[25:43.960 --> 25:45.940]  Jr. in...
[25:45.940 --> 25:47.600]  Why? Why not?
[25:47.600 --> 25:47.920]  What?
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.240]  I don't... I don't understand.
[25:52.680 --> 25:53.980]  It just looks like a bunch
[25:53.980 --> 25:55.460]  of people cosplaying a con.
[25:57.040 --> 25:57.960]  Well, you know,
[25:58.000 --> 25:59.920]  that's kind of what 2 and 3 looked like to me, so
[25:59.920 --> 26:00.800]  that's par for the course.
[26:02.040 --> 26:04.020]  I don't know if I... I don't think I know Matrix
[26:04.020 --> 26:05.860]  well enough to make this declaration.
[26:06.840 --> 26:07.960]  I would be Agent...
[26:09.740 --> 26:10.140]  Uh...
[26:10.140 --> 26:12.140]  Smith? I found out the names of the other
[26:12.140 --> 26:13.860]  agents, by the way. You know, there was originally
[26:13.860 --> 26:15.260]  three agents. Oh yeah.
[26:15.700 --> 26:18.140]  I didn't know there were more names beyond
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.100]  Smith. The square-headed
[26:20.100 --> 26:22.180]  guy is Jones, isn't it? Yeah, there's
[26:22.180 --> 26:23.900]  Smith, there's Jones, and there's Brown.
[26:24.360 --> 26:26.040]  What were Jones and Brown doing
[26:27.100 --> 26:28.260]  while Smith was fucking around?
[26:28.420 --> 26:30.160]  Like, were they fighting a different Neo in a
[26:30.160 --> 26:32.080]  different part of the world? Having
[26:32.080 --> 26:34.220]  their own adventure? I think he just assimilates
[26:34.220 --> 26:36.060]  them, doesn't he? Yeah, I think so.
[26:36.320 --> 26:37.560]  I think that...
[26:38.460 --> 26:40.100]  Like, doesn't he... Like, he's
[26:40.100 --> 26:41.980]  the one that, like, Smith is the one that breaks
[26:41.980 --> 26:43.960]  out of, you know, being part of, like,
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.200]  this thing, like, as, like, an agent or whatever.
[26:46.580 --> 26:47.840]  And he just assimilates these guys.
[26:48.180 --> 26:50.120]  Yeah, he gets, like, anomalied, and then he gets out
[26:50.120 --> 26:52.140]  of the Matrix at some point into a guy that
[26:52.140 --> 26:54.100]  kind of... Oh, it's the guy in your picture,
[26:54.220 --> 26:55.800]  Geoff, the guy next to him. Yeah.
[26:56.180 --> 26:58.040]  Oh, okay. Smith gets out of the Matrix
[26:58.040 --> 26:58.860]  into that guy.
[27:00.340 --> 27:01.400]  Boy, those movies
[27:03.160 --> 27:04.200]  really... Those movies
[27:04.200 --> 27:06.240]  suck. Yeah, but if you
[27:06.800 --> 27:08.360]  lump them all in with Matrix 4,
[27:08.360 --> 27:09.840]  those two movies are a masterpiece.
[27:10.100 --> 27:12.420]  Do you remember... Was it two or
[27:12.420 --> 27:13.940]  three that he pumped
[27:14.420 --> 27:16.140]  Carrie and Moss' heart back to life?
[27:16.900 --> 27:18.340]  Oh, yeah, he squeezes it.
[27:18.620 --> 27:18.840]  Yeah.
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.380]  Third one, I think. That was pretty cool.
[27:24.280 --> 27:26.220]  We're just talking about the Matrix.
[27:26.260 --> 27:28.280]  I stand by Matrix 4 as my favorite
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.520]  Matrix. No, you shut up. No, you don't.
[27:30.800 --> 27:32.200]  It is. It's my favorite.
[27:32.580 --> 27:33.100]  Like, that one left.
[27:34.300 --> 27:35.900]  What'd you say? Matrix 4 is your favorite?
[27:36.500 --> 27:37.740]  It's my favorite of those.
[27:37.840 --> 27:38.700]  I never saw it.
[27:40.740 --> 27:41.780]  Two and three
[27:41.780 --> 27:43.760]  was so fucking painful to get through. I don't know why.
[27:43.760 --> 27:44.820]  Yeah, I didn't like two or three.
[27:45.440 --> 27:46.860]  Why is four your favorite?
[27:47.400 --> 27:48.780]  I just had the most fun with it.
[27:49.040 --> 27:51.940]  I feel like I was maybe a little bit too young when the first
[27:51.940 --> 27:53.600]  Matrix came out to appreciate it
[27:53.600 --> 27:55.940]  at that time. You can still watch it
[27:55.940 --> 27:57.860]  now. Yeah, I've gone back
[27:57.860 --> 27:59.860]  and I've rewatched it. It just doesn't connect.
[28:00.020 --> 28:01.920]  Like, it's cool. It's a cool movie,
[28:02.160 --> 28:03.820]  but it doesn't connect
[28:03.820 --> 28:05.900]  with me in the way that other people talk about it. Gavin, it's
[28:05.900 --> 28:06.740]  no Matrix 4.
[28:07.120 --> 28:09.760]  It is no Matrix 4. It's like a Burley brawl and it has the
[28:09.760 --> 28:11.720]  mile-long highway that they built.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.280]  What happens in the fourth one?
[28:13.880 --> 28:14.900]  Neil Patrick Harris.
[28:16.480 --> 28:17.380]  That's what happens.
[28:18.140 --> 28:19.320]  They talk about stuff.
[28:21.500 --> 28:23.700]  I don't think they talk about stuff in any of the other movies.
[28:23.860 --> 28:25.200]  It's a unique thing of Matrix 4.
[28:26.580 --> 28:27.280]  There is
[28:28.280 --> 28:29.000]  some meta.
[28:29.520 --> 28:31.520]  Is there meta stuff in the other Matrix movie?
[28:32.100 --> 28:33.520]  Where they're talking about their own
[28:33.520 --> 28:34.680]  franchise within the movie?
[28:35.200 --> 28:37.220]  No. That sucks.
[28:38.240 --> 28:38.820]  That sucks.
[28:39.520 --> 28:41.480]  No, it's great. They're analyzing their own film series
[28:41.480 --> 28:42.760]  within the movie. It's good.
[28:43.760 --> 28:45.640]  Didn't the Wachowskis, do they still make things
[28:45.640 --> 28:47.480]  together? Did they make that
[28:47.480 --> 28:49.000]  together or was that only one of them?
[28:49.660 --> 28:50.660]  I think it was just Lana Wachowski.
[28:51.220 --> 28:53.040]  Yeah, I don't think they collaborated on that.
[28:53.800 --> 28:55.560]  What I will say is, regardless of
[28:55.560 --> 28:57.260]  any of the movies, none of them are entering the Matrix.
[28:58.160 --> 28:59.540]  Which we do need to still
[28:59.540 --> 29:00.700]  play. Great.
[29:01.920 --> 29:03.120]  Gavin, why'd you say oh my god?
[29:03.440 --> 29:05.460]  I've got an update. Oh, okay.
[29:09.860 --> 29:10.660]  What's your update?
[29:12.340 --> 29:12.740]  Oh!
[29:12.940 --> 29:15.880]  Wait, so did you see it happen?
[29:16.260 --> 29:17.600]  No, I've got my headphones
[29:17.600 --> 29:18.480]  on and I didn't hear it.
[29:18.900 --> 29:20.860]  It was on the floor when I turned around.
[29:22.560 --> 29:23.540]  So you don't even
[29:23.540 --> 29:25.320]  know if there was a hesitation.
[29:25.820 --> 29:27.060]  Well, it didn't print for at least
[29:27.060 --> 29:28.920]  five minutes because I was keeping it on
[29:28.920 --> 29:29.920]  after I hit print.
[29:30.620 --> 29:33.300]  Can I ask a serious question about the Matrix real quick?
[29:33.640 --> 29:35.040]  Yeah. Oh, it's Jeff.
[29:35.200 --> 29:36.380]  When did Jeff go? Jeff's gone again.
[29:36.820 --> 29:38.920]  Jeff's been gone. He'll be back.
[29:39.340 --> 29:40.520]  Are you kidding me?
[29:40.660 --> 29:42.980]  He had nothing to say about everything
[29:42.980 --> 29:44.380]  Andrew was just saying? My god.
[29:44.700 --> 29:46.940]  Do you remember in
[29:46.940 --> 29:48.680]  War of the Worlds when
[29:49.520 --> 29:51.040]  the noise the monsters
[29:51.040 --> 29:52.380]  would make in War of the Worlds?
[29:53.520 --> 29:53.960]  Yeah.
[29:54.500 --> 29:55.820]  I just heard that
[29:55.820 --> 29:57.960]  noise outside my house and then I lost internet
[29:57.960 --> 29:58.760]  for a second.
[29:58.920 --> 30:01.820]  There may be an alien invasion
[30:01.820 --> 30:03.840]  going on right now. I don't know. Keep an eye out
[30:03.840 --> 30:06.000]  in the lightning strikes. There might be something coming down
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.640]  in them. Oh, shit.
[30:08.400 --> 30:09.920]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I just had to get that out.
[30:09.920 --> 30:11.900]  No, it's fine. I was going to ask a very important Matrix
[30:11.900 --> 30:13.920]  question. What type
[30:13.920 --> 30:15.820]  of canned gravy would Agent
[30:15.820 --> 30:17.000]  Smith most be into?
[30:18.280 --> 30:19.820]  You think he's a caramelized onion?
[30:19.940 --> 30:21.700]  I think he is. Yeah, he is.
[30:21.700 --> 30:23.700]  What kind of
[30:23.700 --> 30:25.280]  things is he fermenting in his fridge?
[30:26.260 --> 30:26.820]  Oh, god.
[30:27.720 --> 30:29.700]  Not fish. Not that
[30:29.700 --> 30:31.680]  much. That dude? I bet
[30:31.680 --> 30:33.860]  you a thousand dollars that dude ferments okra.
[30:34.700 --> 30:35.000]  Oh.
[30:36.080 --> 30:37.180]  That's what he's into.
[30:38.720 --> 30:39.540]  Like fucking
[30:39.540 --> 30:41.500]  slimy fermented pickled okra.
[30:41.760 --> 30:43.680]  Yeah. I'm still just trying to figure out why
[30:43.680 --> 30:45.240]  Roy Jones Jr. was in the Matrix.
[30:45.800 --> 30:47.760]  I'd love to know. Do you think he
[30:47.760 --> 30:49.720]  knows? Do you think he really
[30:49.720 --> 30:51.280]  liked the Matrix and so they put him in?
[30:51.380 --> 30:53.780]  How did that happen? I think he was a
[30:53.780 --> 30:55.680]  fan, probably, or something. Did you ever
[30:55.680 --> 30:57.520]  listen to his album? No. Yeah.
[30:57.640 --> 30:59.660]  Actually, I did. It was around the time
[30:59.660 --> 31:01.600]  that he was ending his
[31:01.600 --> 31:03.640]  boxing career. So he's probably making
[31:03.640 --> 31:05.720]  in that point where they're like, alright, do you make
[31:05.720 --> 31:07.740]  the transition to movies or commentating
[31:07.740 --> 31:09.540]  or, you know, maybe
[31:10.340 --> 31:11.600]  that's not the right move
[31:11.600 --> 31:13.400]  for you at all. Maybe just
[31:13.400 --> 31:14.940]  go quietly into the night.
[31:15.600 --> 31:17.680]  Which is, I think, what he ultimately decided to do. Until he came
[31:17.680 --> 31:19.740]  out to fight Tyson. Was that last
[31:19.740 --> 31:21.480]  year? Two years ago? Yeah,
[31:21.520 --> 31:23.740]  two years ago, I think. Again, I'm just more of
[31:23.740 --> 31:24.560]  a fan of his music.
[31:25.940 --> 31:27.540]  He did have a great rap album.
[31:28.140 --> 31:29.560]  He was one of the best boxers of
[31:29.560 --> 31:31.500]  all time. He just retired
[31:31.500 --> 31:33.580]  four fights too late. I think his
[31:33.580 --> 31:35.560]  music was the theme song to
[31:35.560 --> 31:37.500]  one of those boxing
[31:37.500 --> 31:39.740]  games. I think you're right.
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.660]  I think you're right. I think it was Can't Be
[31:41.660 --> 31:43.180]  Touched. That was a good one. Hey,
[31:43.780 --> 31:45.420]  real quick, rewind it back a little bit.
[31:45.420 --> 31:47.060]  Gavin, you said you had a game or something?
[31:47.660 --> 31:48.160]  Oh, yeah!
[31:51.140 --> 31:51.540]  It's
[31:51.540 --> 31:53.460]  been postponed. What?
[31:54.220 --> 31:56.300]  What does that mean?
[31:56.540 --> 31:57.400]  I just thought of a way to
[31:57.400 --> 31:58.700]  improve it and I need more time.
[31:59.920 --> 32:00.640]  Fair enough.
[32:01.460 --> 32:03.320]  Because I realized, I remember we could do stuff for
[32:03.320 --> 32:04.720]  Patreon. Yeah.
[32:05.720 --> 32:06.440]  Oh, wow.
[32:07.060 --> 32:09.240]  So you're talking about a supplemental
[32:09.240 --> 32:10.940]  that is just for Patreon.
[32:11.460 --> 32:12.900]  Well, it's a supplemental that
[32:12.900 --> 32:14.820]  is going to have stuff that we probably
[32:14.820 --> 32:16.880]  can't put on YouTube. Got it.
[32:16.960 --> 32:18.760]  I'm excited. Because I remember
[32:18.760 --> 32:20.480]  that we can put clips.
[32:20.700 --> 32:23.400]  It's going to be clip heavy. I mean, interesting.
[32:24.040 --> 32:24.860]  Is this going to be...
[32:24.860 --> 32:25.780]  Are we talking about my dick again?
[32:26.520 --> 32:29.000]  No. We can if you want.
[32:29.180 --> 32:30.600]  Oh, gravel dick Ramsey.
[32:31.960 --> 32:32.720]  No, thank you.
[32:33.800 --> 32:34.240]  I...
[32:34.960 --> 32:36.780]  It's funny. Sometimes when I have
[32:36.780 --> 32:38.820]  conversations with my mom, I feel like
[32:38.820 --> 32:40.960]  the way you guys react to me
[32:40.960 --> 32:42.900]  sometimes when I'm listening to
[32:42.900 --> 32:45.100]  things that are happening in her
[32:45.100 --> 32:46.900]  life. My mom can no longer
[32:46.900 --> 32:48.140]  go to her favorite bakery.
[32:48.560 --> 32:51.060]  She has ruined her favorite bakery
[32:51.060 --> 32:52.960]  for her in a way that
[32:52.960 --> 32:54.740]  is so stupid.
[32:55.040 --> 32:56.960]  And I say that in the nicest
[32:56.960 --> 32:58.560]  of ways. The most respectful of ways.
[32:58.700 --> 33:00.200]  Did you take all the money out of her purse?
[33:00.540 --> 33:04.080]  I didn't. No. She...
[33:04.080 --> 33:05.060]  Have you
[33:05.060 --> 33:06.840]  ever been like locked in to like
[33:06.840 --> 33:08.860]  you're going to go to a place and get
[33:08.860 --> 33:11.060]  something and then when they don't have that thing
[33:11.060 --> 33:12.340]  you're completely thrown?
[33:12.800 --> 33:14.740]  Like you have no plan B and you
[33:14.740 --> 33:16.900]  fumble? Have you ever had that
[33:16.900 --> 33:18.880]  experience? Well, I feel like it's never to the point
[33:18.880 --> 33:20.780]  where it's like, I don't know what to do.
[33:20.960 --> 33:22.620]  Usually I go, oh.
[33:23.220 --> 33:24.780]  Well, you know,
[33:24.820 --> 33:26.700]  like my mom, she went to her
[33:26.700 --> 33:28.300]  bakery, she hasn't been to in a little bit,
[33:28.880 --> 33:30.960]  to get cookies. This is what she told me.
[33:31.200 --> 33:32.840]  She was excited to get these chocolate
[33:32.840 --> 33:34.820]  chip cookies. She was doing something that day
[33:34.820 --> 33:36.860]  that she was stressed about, so she thought
[33:36.860 --> 33:38.820]  I'll get these cookies and this will like kind of start
[33:38.820 --> 33:40.980]  my day off right. And she went in
[33:40.980 --> 33:43.080]  and she... it's the same
[33:43.080 --> 33:44.980]  lady that works there. It's a small local
[33:44.980 --> 33:46.860]  bakery and she's always had the
[33:46.860 --> 33:48.640]  same person that she interacts with every time.
[33:48.960 --> 33:49.800]  Is she known by name?
[33:50.460 --> 33:52.780]  I don't think so. It is a thing where
[33:52.780 --> 33:54.840]  they don't know each other's names, I assume.
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.760]  But it's like, it's always
[33:56.760 --> 33:58.300]  the same person behind the counter.
[33:58.920 --> 34:01.060]  And she went in and she said, I'll have two cookies.
[34:01.620 --> 34:02.780]  And the lady said,
[34:02.860 --> 34:04.720]  oh, we stopped making cookies
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.660]  because we're making donuts
[34:06.660 --> 34:08.760]  now. And my mom
[34:09.460 --> 34:10.520]  was not prepared for this.
[34:10.700 --> 34:12.180]  And her brain immediately went,
[34:12.800 --> 34:14.840]  there's a bunch of really good donut
[34:14.840 --> 34:16.820]  places around. I don't know
[34:16.820 --> 34:18.860]  why you would make donuts. This is
[34:18.860 --> 34:19.680]  her internal thought.
[34:20.360 --> 34:21.480]  She's not saying that.
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.040]  She's singing this. Oh, thank God.
[34:24.120 --> 34:25.920]  So the
[34:26.640 --> 34:28.820]  lady behind the counter says, would you like to try
[34:28.820 --> 34:30.840]  one of our jelly donuts? And my
[34:30.840 --> 34:32.860]  mom replies with, I can't have
[34:32.860 --> 34:34.580]  those, was what came out.
[34:34.740 --> 34:36.760]  Which is not true. There's no
[34:36.760 --> 34:38.460]  allergy. There's
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.820]  no... it's just not a thing.
[34:41.480 --> 34:42.400]  And the lady went,
[34:42.840 --> 34:44.900]  uh, well we have cinnamon sugar
[34:44.900 --> 34:46.880]  donuts as well. And my mom
[34:46.880 --> 34:48.820]  doubled down and went, I can't have those
[34:48.820 --> 34:49.140]  either.
[34:50.720 --> 34:52.300]  You're so related.
[34:52.640 --> 34:55.000]  We are getting a more full picture of you.
[34:55.300 --> 34:56.060]  This is crazy.
[34:56.860 --> 34:57.980]  There's a pause.
[34:58.620 --> 35:00.840]  And then my mom said, she didn't know
[35:00.840 --> 35:02.940]  how to handle the silence that was there.
[35:03.100 --> 35:04.840]  So she just said the first thing that came to
[35:04.840 --> 35:06.860]  her mind and she said, if you want
[35:06.860 --> 35:09.100]  a good donut, go to Milk Jam Donuts.
[35:09.200 --> 35:10.860]  Which is a different donut
[35:10.860 --> 35:12.700]  place nearby.
[35:13.720 --> 35:14.040]  And
[35:14.960 --> 35:16.440]  the lady looked at her
[35:16.440 --> 35:18.540]  and said,
[35:19.280 --> 35:20.920]  huh, I would recommend...
[35:20.920 --> 35:22.780]  and then she said a different place.
[35:23.200 --> 35:24.920]  And that was it. And then my mom left
[35:24.920 --> 35:26.720]  and she was the entire time
[35:26.720 --> 35:28.900]  just thinking, why did I say that? Why did I say
[35:28.900 --> 35:30.900]  any of that? That was all
[35:30.900 --> 35:32.480]  dumb. That was all terrible to say.
[35:33.200 --> 35:34.540]  She locked herself out of donuts.
[35:35.160 --> 35:36.540]  She is now locked out.
[35:36.880 --> 35:38.060]  Plenty of donut places.
[35:38.760 --> 35:40.860]  She can't get any other baked goods.
[35:41.420 --> 35:42.980]  You're right. There's no going back
[35:42.980 --> 35:44.100]  from that. No.
[35:44.520 --> 35:46.460]  When you tell a person
[35:46.460 --> 35:49.060]  at a bakery where they should get donuts
[35:49.060 --> 35:50.920]  that they sell that isn't
[35:50.920 --> 35:52.900]  theirs. Do you think maybe if she went
[35:52.900 --> 35:54.800]  in with your balaclava, she could get
[35:54.800 --> 35:55.220]  some stuff?
[35:56.600 --> 35:57.080]  Honestly,
[35:57.400 --> 35:59.060]  for how bad of a position
[35:59.060 --> 36:00.800]  she's left herself there,
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.120]  it would actually help. It would be a step up.
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.240]  You know, I never thought about that,
[36:05.320 --> 36:07.000]  but if we ever get a chance, we should
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.220]  reprint that balaclava and sell
[36:09.220 --> 36:10.900]  it as a do-over mask.
[36:11.980 --> 36:12.900]  The ultimate
[36:12.900 --> 36:15.020]  mulligan mask? Yeah, the ultimate mulligan.
[36:15.180 --> 36:15.900]  Mullah mask.
[36:18.120 --> 36:19.160]  That has been
[36:19.160 --> 36:21.020]  the most recent thing with my mom, as well as
[36:21.020 --> 36:23.120]  she keeps asking me who says awesome
[36:23.120 --> 36:24.980]  sauce, and I don't know how to answer that.
[36:26.300 --> 36:26.740]  She
[36:26.740 --> 36:28.880]  has asked me on
[36:28.880 --> 36:31.120]  three separate occasions, and I
[36:31.120 --> 36:32.440]  just don't know what to say.
[36:32.660 --> 36:33.820]  The answer is simple.
[36:36.180 --> 36:36.860]  She's like,
[36:36.940 --> 36:39.040]  who says awesome sauce? And I was
[36:39.040 --> 36:40.880]  so taken aback. I said, what do you mean?
[36:41.320 --> 36:43.100]  And she said, somebody says it.
[36:43.520 --> 36:45.060]  And I said, it was like a phrase
[36:45.060 --> 36:47.080]  a long time ago that some... it's like an internet
[36:47.080 --> 36:49.060]  thing, kind of, way
[36:49.060 --> 36:51.100]  back. And she said, no, no,
[36:51.100 --> 36:53.180]  that's not it. There is a specific person
[36:53.180 --> 36:55.080]  that is known for saying it.
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.080]  Who is it? And I have no idea who
[36:57.080 --> 36:58.940]  she's talking about. And she just keeps
[36:59.360 --> 36:59.760]  asking.
[37:02.180 --> 37:03.160]  She forgets that
[37:03.160 --> 37:04.940]  she's asked me. Like, there will...
[37:04.940 --> 37:07.140]  enough time will pass, and then she will ask
[37:07.140 --> 37:08.980]  me again, and it sticks out
[37:08.980 --> 37:11.280]  because I maintain to not know how to respond.
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.980]  Who is the person that
[37:12.980 --> 37:13.680]  says awesome sauce?
[37:14.520 --> 37:16.740]  I guess if anyone's listening knows,
[37:16.900 --> 37:18.980]  please let me know so I can forward it to
[37:18.980 --> 37:21.080]  her, because she keeps asking me.
[37:21.300 --> 37:22.940]  Was it invented
[37:22.940 --> 37:24.840]  by Homestar Runner?
[37:25.280 --> 37:26.680]  Is that a Homestar Runner thing?
[37:27.140 --> 37:28.960]  I can't imagine your mom being on Homestar.
[37:29.220 --> 37:30.860]  You think your mom is
[37:30.860 --> 37:32.800]  watching Homestar? She, like, loves
[37:32.800 --> 37:34.940]  strong bad emails in the cheats?
[37:35.540 --> 37:37.080]  Somebody... oh, I
[37:37.080 --> 37:38.740]  think I have the answer for you.
[37:39.400 --> 37:40.720]  Okay. It's
[37:41.340 --> 37:42.880]  Chris Pratt in
[37:42.880 --> 37:44.920]  Parks and Rec, maybe. That
[37:44.920 --> 37:47.060]  is... yes! That would be it. She did watch
[37:47.060 --> 37:48.800]  Parks and Rec. Thank you, Jeff. Jesus.
[37:49.300 --> 37:50.740]  Yeah, it's either him or the lady.
[37:50.980 --> 37:52.980]  Aubrey Plaza. I see both of them in this. I don't know.
[37:53.060 --> 37:55.020]  Well, ask her if it was Chris Pratt or
[37:55.020 --> 37:56.380]  ask her if it was Homestar Runner.
[37:57.760 --> 37:59.000]  I'm sure that's not where she
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.160]  got it from. I'm just surprised that that's where it originated
[38:01.160 --> 38:01.540]  from.
[38:04.040 --> 38:04.400]  Huh.
[38:05.940 --> 38:06.920]  Mrs. Panton really
[38:06.920 --> 38:07.680]  into the cheat.
[38:10.020 --> 38:11.140]  That's what I'm saying.
[38:11.380 --> 38:12.720]  She's a big fan of Coach Z.
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.380]  The whole
[38:15.380 --> 38:16.340]  gang's here.
[38:16.760 --> 38:19.260]  They want to say awesome sauce
[38:19.260 --> 38:20.520]  to Andrew's mom.
[38:22.320 --> 38:23.520]  I can just imagine her
[38:23.520 --> 38:25.360]  walking home from the bakery muttering
[38:25.360 --> 38:27.200]  to herself about awesome sauce and then
[38:27.200 --> 38:29.620]  coming home and sitting in a chair that she doesn't know how to use.
[38:37.660 --> 38:39.340]  I'm so excited for this to be you
[38:39.340 --> 38:41.320]  in a few years and getting to go through it with you, Andrew.
[38:42.500 --> 38:43.300]  Me asking
[38:43.300 --> 38:45.360]  you about awesome sauce? Yeah, like when you
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.240]  hit the A, because we'll still be friends
[38:47.240 --> 38:49.160]  when you're in your 50s or 60s.
[38:49.240 --> 38:49.480]  Sure.
[38:51.700 --> 38:53.300]  We are who our parents
[38:53.300 --> 38:55.180]  or we will be who our parents are now, right?
[38:56.280 --> 38:57.320]  I hope not
[38:57.320 --> 38:59.280]  to that level. I don't want to get
[38:59.280 --> 39:00.400]  blocked out of a bakery.
[39:02.200 --> 39:03.360]  If I had to pick
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.500]  a person in my life who stood the highest
[39:05.500 --> 39:06.940]  chance of getting blocked from a bakery,
[39:07.460 --> 39:09.320]  you would be the only person on the list.
[39:10.940 --> 39:13.640]  You told us a story about your mom
[39:13.640 --> 39:15.500]  that should have just been about...
[39:15.500 --> 39:17.680]  If you told us that, you're like, I lied, it was me.
[39:17.920 --> 39:19.320]  Everyone would just go, yeah.
[39:20.020 --> 39:20.220]  Yeah.
[39:21.060 --> 39:23.480]  You can be honest with us. Was it you?
[39:24.100 --> 39:24.840]  No, it wasn't me.
[39:25.240 --> 39:27.660]  I wish it was. Was it you
[39:27.660 --> 39:29.680]  wondering what a butt plug was this
[39:29.680 --> 39:30.280]  whole time?
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.620]  She knows about
[39:35.320 --> 39:37.420]  those now. She's informed.
[39:38.360 --> 39:39.780]  What would be the funniest thing to put
[39:39.780 --> 39:40.460]  on a butt plug?
[39:40.460 --> 39:42.780]  A bottle of chubby.
[39:44.480 --> 39:45.640]  Strong bad.
[39:48.160 --> 39:49.860]  One of these
[39:50.360 --> 39:51.920]  little fucks I just posted
[39:51.920 --> 39:53.960]  a picture of from
[39:53.960 --> 39:55.180]  All-Star Runner.
[39:56.940 --> 39:58.420]  What about a grown plug?
[40:00.620 --> 40:02.200]  Here with every step.
[40:04.400 --> 40:05.140]  Interesting.
[40:06.080 --> 40:08.040]  Is it part of the thing with butt plugs, those
[40:08.040 --> 40:10.360]  people not knowing it's in?
[40:11.080 --> 40:12.220]  Well, some of them have, like, tails
[40:12.220 --> 40:12.800]  on the back.
[40:13.340 --> 40:16.180]  Yeah, you know, maybe it's like
[40:16.180 --> 40:18.220]  a sense of danger, like, oh my god, when I go to the
[40:18.220 --> 40:19.660]  grocery store, everyone will hear me.
[40:21.560 --> 40:24.120]  I really want somebody to have that in and then fall
[40:24.120 --> 40:24.680]  down a hill.
[40:26.480 --> 40:28.220]  They'll think I'm brushing my teeth,
[40:28.480 --> 40:30.460]  but it's just my butt plug.
[40:32.100 --> 40:34.200]  What if it was
[40:34.200 --> 40:35.500]  triggered by you farting?
[40:35.500 --> 40:36.560]  Like the air
[40:36.560 --> 40:38.360]  shooting the pipe up?
[40:38.860 --> 40:40.980]  Dude! Like an amplifier.
[40:47.160 --> 40:48.560]  It's like a kazoo.
[40:49.460 --> 40:51.320]  What are those things they put on the German
[40:51.320 --> 40:53.460]  planes when they dive to make
[40:53.460 --> 40:55.080]  the terrifying dive sound?
[40:56.640 --> 40:58.140]  I got no fucking clue what you're talking about.
[40:58.580 --> 40:59.380]  Yeah, I don't know.
[41:01.040 --> 41:03.080]  I know what you mean, but
[41:03.920 --> 41:05.280]  I just am imagining...
[41:05.280 --> 41:06.480]  Like one of those, but for farts.
[41:08.360 --> 41:09.200]  Oh, they would
[41:09.200 --> 41:10.940]  like, they would put up, they would
[41:10.940 --> 41:13.060]  stick a playing card in the spokes of the plane, right?
[41:17.060 --> 41:17.860]  Stuka siren.
[41:18.520 --> 41:21.200]  Yeah, it's like a little air-driven
[41:22.220 --> 41:23.060]  thingy that they would
[41:23.060 --> 41:24.520]  use to scare people on the ground.
[41:25.360 --> 41:26.820]  Do you think the guy, the
[41:26.820 --> 41:29.080]  woo guy, is it the whistle goes woo?
[41:29.500 --> 41:30.460]  You know who I'm talking about?
[41:30.460 --> 41:31.420]  Bub Rub?
[41:31.840 --> 41:34.780]  You talking about Bub Rub and Lil Sis?
[41:35.440 --> 41:36.620]  Yeah, I'm talking about Bub Rub.
[41:36.900 --> 41:38.480]  You think Bub Rub has a stuka
[41:38.480 --> 41:39.540]  siren on his plane?
[41:40.300 --> 41:41.140]  And he's the first one?
[41:41.720 --> 41:42.720]  Gotta get those noises.
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.680]  What do you think Bub Rub's doing today? He's still around, right?
[41:46.020 --> 41:47.700]  I don't know.
[41:48.160 --> 41:49.620]  I love Bub Rub.
[41:49.660 --> 41:52.500]  That's gotta be 15 years old, right?
[41:53.060 --> 41:53.900]  I'm sorry, 15?
[41:54.220 --> 41:54.980]  Is that what you said?
[41:55.900 --> 41:58.540]  Oh man, minimum it's gotta be
[41:58.540 --> 42:00.020]  15? It's gotta be more, don't you think?
[42:00.460 --> 42:01.200]  Who is Bub Rub?
[42:01.920 --> 42:03.520]  You don't remember the whistle goes woo?
[42:04.620 --> 42:05.760]  Yeah, you said all that.
[42:07.080 --> 42:08.860]  You don't know Bub Rub?
[42:09.300 --> 42:10.560]  I don't know Bub Rub.
[42:10.800 --> 42:12.100]  It was from...
[42:12.100 --> 42:14.540]  I'll post a link to the YouTube video, but just watch
[42:14.540 --> 42:16.340]  it later or whatever. It was from
[42:16.340 --> 42:18.360]  a news report in the
[42:19.100 --> 42:20.060]  Bay Area,
[42:20.220 --> 42:21.700]  I think, and
[42:22.400 --> 42:24.540]  they had whistles on
[42:24.540 --> 42:26.340]  their cars, like on the muffler tips,
[42:26.340 --> 42:28.120]  and it would whistle
[42:28.120 --> 42:30.660]  when you drove by, and they interview Bub Rub
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.440]  and Lil Sis about it,
[42:32.580 --> 42:33.880]  and he talks about how
[42:33.880 --> 42:36.360]  it's only in the morning, you're supposed to be up cooking
[42:36.360 --> 42:38.420]  breakfast, and then he keeps imitating
[42:38.420 --> 42:40.320]  the whistle, and in
[42:40.320 --> 42:42.360]  2004, funniest
[42:42.360 --> 42:43.060]  thing in the world.
[42:43.320 --> 42:46.500]  Could we watch it right now and play the audio
[42:46.500 --> 42:47.800]  and get in trouble?
[42:48.700 --> 42:50.220]  I mean, I wouldn't put the audio
[42:50.220 --> 42:52.320]  in a wide-release podcast.
[42:53.280 --> 42:53.800]  Honestly?
[42:53.800 --> 42:55.360]  Hey, you know what?
[42:55.780 --> 42:57.960]  Hey, let's put it to a vote.
[42:58.720 --> 42:59.520]  Try it.
[42:59.960 --> 43:00.120]  Yeah.
[43:01.840 --> 43:03.360]  Any opportunity to listen to Bub Rub?
[43:03.900 --> 43:05.880]  Well, now I'm scared.
[43:06.160 --> 43:07.240]  I don't know. I think I'm a no.
[43:08.080 --> 43:08.480]  Nick?
[43:09.620 --> 43:10.580]  I'm horrified, no.
[43:11.820 --> 43:13.000]  I gotta vote no.
[43:13.040 --> 43:14.360]  I gotta vote no.
[43:14.640 --> 43:17.920]  That is a no vote that I support.
[43:18.120 --> 43:18.820]  I'm okay with it.
[43:19.080 --> 43:22.060]  I mean, you voted yes, but yeah, I get it.
[43:22.060 --> 43:24.020]  Yeah, because I wanted it, but I'm glad that the
[43:24.020 --> 43:26.040]  adults in the room stood up and didn't allow
[43:26.040 --> 43:27.900]  it to happen. Well, I was immediately thinking
[43:27.900 --> 43:29.960]  you can have three strikes on YouTube, but also
[43:29.960 --> 43:32.040]  one strike makes you lose features,
[43:32.280 --> 43:34.160]  and then I was starting to think, oh, what's that
[43:34.160 --> 43:34.520]  worth?
[43:36.340 --> 43:37.140]  That's a good point.
[43:37.920 --> 43:40.080]  I wonder who even owns the
[43:40.920 --> 43:42.260]  kron4.com archival
[43:42.260 --> 43:42.480]  footage.
[43:43.900 --> 43:46.080]  So what was it, like, Traffic's Vuvuzela?
[43:46.300 --> 43:47.540]  What was the noise like?
[43:47.540 --> 43:50.020]  You just fucking nailed it. That's 100% it.
[43:50.020 --> 43:51.820]  That's better than I could have described it.
[43:52.020 --> 43:52.060]  Yeah.
[43:53.620 --> 43:55.520]  It's just that Bub Rub is a character.
[43:56.520 --> 43:57.300]  And it's like,
[43:57.740 --> 43:59.580]  it's basically, you know how, like, when you do
[43:59.920 --> 44:01.940]  man-on-the-street interviews, like, sir, come over
[44:01.940 --> 44:04.000]  here, what is your name? And your name's like, oh, my name's
[44:04.000 --> 44:05.980]  Gavin Free, and they're like, what do you think about the construction
[44:05.980 --> 44:07.980]  in the neighborhood? And you're like, well, you know, it's inconvenient,
[44:08.080 --> 44:09.520]  but I appreciate that they're making improvements.
[44:09.880 --> 44:11.840]  It was like that kind of thing, but the dude
[44:11.840 --> 44:14.060]  walks up, he's like, my name's Bub Rub, this little sis.
[44:14.500 --> 44:15.600]  And you're like, what?
[44:16.680 --> 44:18.080]  And then he just goes into the whole thing.
[44:18.080 --> 44:19.720]  It's very funny. It's really good.
[44:20.300 --> 44:21.420]  Definitely worth your time.
[44:22.160 --> 44:23.820]  Has anyone watched the documentary
[44:23.820 --> 44:26.260]  Chillin' at the Mansion featuring himself?
[44:26.840 --> 44:27.200]  No.
[44:27.820 --> 44:29.080]  What? What?
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.560]  He collaborated with people,
[44:32.320 --> 44:34.200]  it says Linnell would hook up
[44:34.200 --> 44:36.180]  with the administrators of the website
[44:36.180 --> 44:38.020]  BubRub.com, who started selling Bub Rub
[44:38.020 --> 44:40.280]  themed shirts, underwear, and even
[44:40.280 --> 44:42.180]  ringtones. The website also
[44:42.180 --> 44:44.320]  went on to promote it and sell a DVD documentary
[44:44.320 --> 44:46.320]  titled Chillin' at the Mansion
[44:46.320 --> 44:47.800]  featuring Linnell himself.
[44:48.540 --> 44:50.420]  I didn't know that he turned this
[44:50.420 --> 44:52.400]  into an industry, but I'm into it.
[44:52.460 --> 44:53.980]  We need to do a watch-along of that.
[44:54.460 --> 44:56.480]  It's a 17-minute video
[44:56.480 --> 44:58.440]  that looks like it's just him talking
[44:58.440 --> 45:00.460]  to the camera. Just him chillin' at the
[45:00.460 --> 45:02.420]  mansion. I bet that's a long 17 minutes.
[45:02.900 --> 45:04.600]  Yeah, I bet it's long.
[45:06.300 --> 45:08.280]  Some people just perfectly monetize
[45:08.280 --> 45:08.720]  the moment.
[45:10.400 --> 45:12.360]  Would you rather watch the entirety of
[45:12.360 --> 45:14.060]  Bub Rub Chillin' at the Mansion or
[45:14.060 --> 45:16.260]  Painkiller The Making of Part 1 Again?
[45:16.460 --> 45:16.720]  Bub Rub.
[45:18.360 --> 45:19.980]  I'd pay $1,000 to
[45:19.980 --> 45:21.380]  shoot a horse to watch Bub Rub.
[45:24.980 --> 45:26.040]  Hey, it's
[45:26.040 --> 45:28.300]  Paris. You know I love sparkly
[45:28.300 --> 45:30.000]  things, right? Like stars.
[45:30.500 --> 45:32.180]  Duh. And thanks to Hilton
[45:32.180 --> 45:34.100]  and AutoCamp, I just slept

[45:36.140 --> 45:38.160]  serving looks by the fire outside
[45:38.160 --> 45:39.780]  my luxurious Airstream,
[45:40.240 --> 45:41.680]  making s'mores with the kids
[45:41.680 --> 45:43.720]  while a national park

[46:25.160 --> 46:26.000]  Maybe something
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.720]  we should touch on that has
[46:27.720 --> 46:29.980]  warped all of our views, I'd like to think,
[46:30.060 --> 46:32.060]  since we did it. We did a movie battle.
[46:32.340 --> 46:34.140]  We did a summer movie auction
[46:34.140 --> 46:34.960]  thing. Oh yeah, that's right.
[46:35.780 --> 46:37.640]  That'll be a supplemental. I'm getting
[46:37.640 --> 46:39.720]  page ads on this bub rub thing
[46:39.720 --> 46:41.400]  for The Strangers Chapter 1,
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.760]  which I don't like, as someone who doesn't
[46:43.760 --> 46:45.740]  own it. I saw a trailer for it the other night
[46:45.740 --> 46:47.780]  and I was like, god damn. Did it scare you?
[46:48.200 --> 46:48.920]  Yeah, a little bit.
[46:50.020 --> 46:51.760]  I also don't remember what
[46:51.760 --> 46:53.740]  fucking movies I got, apparently, because I
[46:53.740 --> 46:55.580]  got sucked into thinking I had The Crow.
[46:58.120 --> 46:59.780]  So we did a thing where we listed out
[46:59.780 --> 47:01.740]  all the summer releases and then we had an
[47:01.740 --> 47:03.820]  auction for who got what
[47:03.820 --> 47:06.080]  and the goal is to build
[47:06.080 --> 47:07.900]  a roster of movies
[47:07.900 --> 47:10.380]  that will earn the most domestically
[47:10.380 --> 47:11.280]  by the end of the summer.
[47:12.220 --> 47:13.940]  So we all got different things.
[47:14.540 --> 47:16.180]  I'm very excited for people to watch it.
[47:16.360 --> 47:17.780]  And we all understood it immediately.
[47:18.440 --> 47:19.660]  Yep. We did.
[47:20.560 --> 47:22.220]  Once an example was
[47:22.220 --> 47:24.140]  given, it was like,
[47:24.220 --> 47:26.140]  oh okay, I get what we're doing here.
[47:26.460 --> 47:27.960]  Every time it was explained to us
[47:27.960 --> 47:30.100]  before that, dude, I couldn't make
[47:30.100 --> 47:31.760]  heads or tails of it. I'm sorry, Andrew.
[47:31.980 --> 47:33.640]  I love how hesitantly we
[47:33.640 --> 47:35.660]  entered that recording and how excited
[47:35.660 --> 47:37.500]  we were at the end of it. Oh my god.
[47:38.020 --> 47:39.420]  We just wanted to do that for everything.
[47:39.860 --> 47:41.400]  Do you think Ith has already made me
[47:41.400 --> 47:42.540]  200 million dollars yet?
[47:45.700 --> 47:47.560]  It has spurred
[47:47.560 --> 47:49.740]  some really fun trash talking in our Slack
[47:49.740 --> 47:51.600]  that I am excited to continue throughout
[47:51.600 --> 47:53.520]  the summer. You and Eric going at it last night
[47:53.520 --> 47:55.640]  was funny. Cannot believe that's how the game
[47:55.640 --> 47:57.300]  started last night. That was fucking
[47:57.300 --> 47:59.640]  unreal. I was freaking
[48:00.680 --> 48:01.720]  out, like standing
[48:01.720 --> 48:03.300]  up from my seat.
[48:03.480 --> 48:05.800]  Yeah! Harold the Purple Crayon!
[48:07.000 --> 48:07.900]  So you're at
[48:07.900 --> 48:09.760]  an Austin FC game last night
[48:09.760 --> 48:11.840]  and you own the film
[48:11.840 --> 48:14.000]  Harold and the Purple Crayon, which stars
[48:14.000 --> 48:15.960]  Zachary Levi. Yeah, absolutely.
[48:16.560 --> 48:18.080]  And did they promote
[48:18.080 --> 48:19.760]  Harold and the Purple Crayon when he was doing
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.920]  his Austin FC thing or was it just, hey, celebrity
[48:21.920 --> 48:23.660]  here? It was just like
[48:23.660 --> 48:25.660]  Austin resident Zachary Levi
[48:25.660 --> 48:27.800]  and I was like yelling at people to
[48:27.800 --> 48:28.780]  watch Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[48:28.780 --> 48:29.860]  Harold! Harold!
[48:31.220 --> 48:32.800]  That's right, he does live here, doesn't
[48:32.800 --> 48:34.800]  he? Uh-huh. Is that why
[48:34.800 --> 48:36.840]  he was on the podcast that one time? I assume so.
[48:36.840 --> 48:37.280]  Yeah, probably.
[48:39.260 --> 48:40.660]  When did he promote
[48:40.660 --> 48:41.420]  Shazam 2?
[48:42.680 --> 48:44.840]  I think he was probably promoting Shazam
[48:44.840 --> 48:46.760]  1. I think it was Shazam
[48:46.760 --> 48:48.260]  1. Yeah. That makes sense.
[48:49.940 --> 48:50.880]  Maybe we should
[48:50.880 --> 48:52.640]  see if he wants to come on and promote
[48:52.640 --> 48:54.260]  Harold and the Purple Crayon.
[48:54.860 --> 48:56.800]  No, we can't do that! That's
[48:56.800 --> 48:58.620]  unfair. We can't unfairly
[48:58.620 --> 49:00.900]  tip the scales in our own competition.
[49:01.580 --> 49:02.500]  I will say, I
[49:02.500 --> 49:04.260]  don't want to tip the scales.
[49:04.700 --> 49:06.260]  I'll leave it up to the people
[49:06.700 --> 49:08.720]  to have Harold and the Purple
[49:08.720 --> 49:10.860]  Crayon bring in $350 million
[49:11.660 --> 49:12.800]  without our help
[49:12.800 --> 49:13.920]  at all. We got this.
[49:14.520 --> 49:16.540]  I really like the idea of Eric
[49:16.540 --> 49:18.540]  booking Zachary Levi and then us
[49:18.540 --> 49:20.120]  voting that he can't come on.
[49:21.340 --> 49:22.460]  He's like waiting
[49:22.460 --> 49:24.520]  in the wings. If he
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.660]  books Zachary Levi, I get to
[49:26.660 --> 49:28.560]  book Michael Keaton for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.
[49:28.640 --> 49:30.060]  Oh, please! Go for it!
[49:30.200 --> 49:32.400]  If you want to book Michael Keaton
[49:32.400 --> 49:34.160]  for this podcast, please do.
[49:34.560 --> 49:36.600]  Mr. Keaton, you are officially invited. Thank you.
[49:37.460 --> 49:38.480]  I'm booking Cosner
[49:38.480 --> 49:39.700]  then for part 2 of that
[49:39.700 --> 49:42.460]  drab movie. But you have to be careful
[49:43.260 --> 49:44.740]  because you don't have part 1.
[49:45.440 --> 49:45.620]  Yeah.
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.400]  You'll be promoting my part 1. You gotta bring him on
[49:48.400 --> 49:50.400]  after. You gotta do it between
[49:50.400 --> 49:50.980]  the two.
[49:50.980 --> 49:53.760]  So when is that coming out?
[49:54.120 --> 49:56.020]  I would love for that to come out as soon
[49:56.020 --> 49:57.920]  as possible. And we gotta stop putting out
[49:58.920 --> 50:00.200]  drafts. We got some of those done.
[50:00.340 --> 50:02.080]  We have a lot coming
[50:02.080 --> 50:03.580]  down the pipe. A lot.
[50:03.900 --> 50:05.940]  We've been very... since
[50:05.940 --> 50:08.060]  sort of like, okay, the shutdown's happening
[50:08.060 --> 50:10.060]  and us going, okay, we're gonna keep doing
[50:10.060 --> 50:11.980]  this. We started just...
[50:11.980 --> 50:13.720]  I get a lot of credit to Andrew. Just
[50:13.720 --> 50:16.200]  let's keep going. Let's just keep going.
[50:16.940 --> 50:17.880]  And it's really
[50:17.880 --> 50:19.880]  exciting. I'm very excited for everything
[50:19.880 --> 50:21.340]  coming out. Yep. Oh, big time.
[50:22.140 --> 50:23.180]  Big, big, big time. And like,
[50:23.840 --> 50:26.080]  fun gas once we get everything set up.
[50:26.100 --> 50:27.840]  Oh yeah, we're lubing that pipe up
[50:27.840 --> 50:28.680]  with fun gas.
[50:30.420 --> 50:31.940]  Has anyone ever lubed anything
[50:31.940 --> 50:34.040]  with gas? Then we're gonna shoot so many
[50:34.040 --> 50:36.120]  fucking comedy butt plugs
[50:36.120 --> 50:37.680]  out of it and all over the audience.
[50:38.300 --> 50:39.680]  I like as soon as we get
[50:39.680 --> 50:41.820]  into the realm of just like, appreciating the audience
[50:41.820 --> 50:43.680]  for the support, Geoff takes it to like
[50:43.680 --> 50:45.320]  jeers and butts. Always.
[50:46.040 --> 50:47.360]  Rope. I'm just trying to
[50:47.360 --> 50:49.680]  illustrate how excited
[50:49.680 --> 50:51.800]  we all are to be doing the Regulation Podcast
[50:51.800 --> 50:53.480]  and to be having
[50:53.480 --> 50:55.620]  such an amazing groundswell of
[50:55.620 --> 50:57.500]  support from the audience who I think are just
[50:58.580 --> 50:59.380]  the greatest
[51:01.280 --> 51:01.680]  people
[51:01.680 --> 51:03.620]  on earth. I mean, I guess you could say that. I was
[51:03.620 --> 51:05.720]  just gonna say that I really genuinely
[51:05.720 --> 51:07.860]  from the bottom of my heart just appreciate
[51:07.860 --> 51:09.440]  not only the support
[51:12.340 --> 51:13.860]  but just the well wishes
[51:13.860 --> 51:15.440]  and just the
[51:15.440 --> 51:17.220]  general feeling
[51:17.220 --> 51:19.200]  and camaraderie and
[51:19.660 --> 51:21.440]  commiseration I feel amongst all of them. If you
[51:21.440 --> 51:23.480]  want it to be, whatever that thing you just said was
[51:23.480 --> 51:24.840]  is cool too, but I just
[51:24.840 --> 51:26.760]  I don't know. I just really
[51:27.880 --> 51:28.280]  genuinely
[51:29.560 --> 51:31.480]  appreciate and love and feel
[51:32.260 --> 51:33.420]  indebted to our audience and
[51:33.420 --> 51:35.220]  I just want to entertain them in the best way possible.
[51:35.800 --> 51:37.340]  It is a constant
[51:37.340 --> 51:39.520]  shock of, and shock not in the
[51:39.520 --> 51:41.460]  sense of surprise, but like
[51:41.460 --> 51:43.560]  our community is so wonderful
[51:43.560 --> 51:44.600]  and supportive
[51:45.360 --> 51:47.360]  and there have been so many instances
[51:47.360 --> 51:49.960]  since we launched of that being displayed.
[51:50.180 --> 51:51.580]  It is constantly
[51:51.580 --> 51:52.860]  just like, how did
[51:53.440 --> 51:54.820]  this happen around us?
[51:55.500 --> 51:57.380]  We're so unbelievably
[51:57.380 --> 51:59.260]  lucky. It's been fun seeing
[51:59.260 --> 52:01.380]  you pop up in the Discord, Jeff.
[52:02.200 --> 52:03.260]  I've been having
[52:03.260 --> 52:05.940]  fun. It's funny because I've
[52:05.940 --> 52:07.360]  largely strayed away from
[52:07.360 --> 52:07.920]  online
[52:10.240 --> 52:11.720]  anything for a
[52:11.720 --> 52:11.920]  while.
[52:13.680 --> 52:15.460]  Discord is a little overwhelming
[52:16.480 --> 52:17.680]  to jump right into
[52:17.680 --> 52:19.620]  and there's so much going on. There's like
[52:19.620 --> 52:21.840]  10,000 people on the Discord or something
[52:22.500 --> 52:23.300]  and it's like
[52:24.900 --> 52:25.580]  every thread
[52:25.580 --> 52:27.440]  or forum, I don't even know how to describe them,
[52:28.300 --> 52:29.360]  I try to wade into.
[52:29.500 --> 52:30.920]  I get excited about it and then I quickly
[52:31.300 --> 52:33.680]  I try to go in the sports one and then I was so overwhelmed
[52:33.680 --> 52:35.420]  with just all the different conversations
[52:35.420 --> 52:37.640]  and everybody seemed to know so much more about sports than I did
[52:37.640 --> 52:38.600]  and I was just like...
[52:38.600 --> 52:40.900]  I quietly lurk
[52:40.900 --> 52:42.600]  a lot in the Discord and every once in a while I get
[52:42.600 --> 52:43.640]  brave enough to type something.
[52:44.160 --> 52:46.660]  I feel like our community feels like early internet
[52:46.660 --> 52:48.460]  fun again. It's got such
[52:48.460 --> 52:49.400]  cool energy.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.680]  It really does. It's awesome.
[52:52.460 --> 52:54.160]  You know what isn't awesome is the Canucks.
[52:54.740 --> 52:56.580]  They're not great. I'm stressed.
[52:57.480 --> 52:58.900]  What's the series at right now?
[52:59.200 --> 53:00.500]  2-2. Game 5.
[53:00.620 --> 53:01.040]  Tonight.
[53:03.460 --> 53:04.360]  I'm nervous.
[53:04.980 --> 53:06.180]  But what I am excited about
[53:06.180 --> 53:07.480]  in the realm of sports
[53:07.480 --> 53:09.920]  I really want to do this with you guys because I do it
[53:09.920 --> 53:12.220]  as part of my fantasy football league every year.
[53:13.320 --> 53:14.340]  I want us to get all in
[53:14.340 --> 53:15.740]  on the Scripps National Spelling Bee
[53:15.740 --> 53:18.200]  when it starts up. It's two weeks
[53:18.200 --> 53:19.540]  away. Pick a kid?
[53:19.960 --> 53:22.300]  I want us to pick a kid. I want us to watch
[53:22.300 --> 53:24.340]  it together. It gets intense
[53:24.340 --> 53:26.080]  in a way that you would not
[53:26.080 --> 53:28.180]  anticipate when you have a kid on the line.
[53:28.760 --> 53:30.260]  Can we auction the kids?
[53:31.480 --> 53:31.840]  Uh...
[53:33.440 --> 53:33.800]  No.
[53:34.780 --> 53:35.600]  I mean
[53:35.600 --> 53:37.700]  we could but probably
[53:37.700 --> 53:38.600]  not a great idea.
[53:38.960 --> 53:39.560]  20.
[53:42.300 --> 53:42.780]  No.
[53:43.480 --> 53:45.840]  We're not actually purchasing the children.
[53:47.380 --> 53:47.980]  Oh.
[53:48.240 --> 53:49.880]  Oh. Oh. I thought
[53:49.880 --> 53:51.320]  we were actually illegally going to
[53:52.380 --> 53:53.800]  buy them and then
[53:53.800 --> 53:55.220]  steal them. We're just... okay.
[53:55.620 --> 53:57.920]  An auction draft
[53:57.920 --> 53:58.960]  like the summer league.
[53:59.160 --> 54:00.780]  I already feel like
[54:00.780 --> 54:02.900]  I already feel like doing
[54:02.900 --> 54:05.020]  the spelling bee and doing content around
[54:05.020 --> 54:06.980]  it is like walking such a
[54:06.980 --> 54:08.940]  fine line. Like I feel weird about it
[54:08.940 --> 54:11.000]  already. You don't think a video before that
[54:11.000 --> 54:12.520]  called the kid auction?
[54:12.580 --> 54:14.060]  But it's all... it's public.
[54:14.720 --> 54:16.580]  It wouldn't be anything that they're not already projecting. So you're saying
[54:16.580 --> 54:18.060]  you don't want to illegally
[54:18.580 --> 54:20.860]  auction and traffic the kids is what you're saying?
[54:21.060 --> 54:21.640]  You don't want to do that?
[54:22.700 --> 54:24.800]  Do you think my issue with it
[54:24.800 --> 54:26.320]  is that it's public or private?
[54:26.700 --> 54:28.420]  I'm saying I
[54:28.420 --> 54:30.380]  understand that it feels weird
[54:30.380 --> 54:32.420]  but like we're not doing anything that they're not
[54:32.420 --> 54:34.180]  already doing. What does that mean?
[54:34.300 --> 54:35.680]  That didn't help at all, dude.
[54:36.240 --> 54:38.540]  That didn't help at all. What are you
[54:38.540 --> 54:40.420]  saying? Because you
[54:40.420 --> 54:42.480]  have to... it's like
[54:42.480 --> 54:44.600]  we have to pick our kids, right?
[54:44.660 --> 54:46.180]  We have to evaluate. That's
[54:46.180 --> 54:47.480]  the problem!
[54:49.500 --> 54:50.800]  This is... you're
[54:50.800 --> 54:52.660]  saying the part that I have a problem
[54:52.660 --> 54:53.640]  with to start.
[54:54.540 --> 54:56.560]  This is gonna be like the movie league
[54:56.560 --> 54:57.780]  all over again. You're like
[54:57.780 --> 55:00.540]  I don't know about this. And then as soon as
[55:00.540 --> 55:02.560]  we're done, you're gonna be like
[55:02.560 --> 55:04.540]  that was so fucking fun. I can't
[55:04.540 --> 55:06.580]  wait for next year. I can't wait to do
[55:06.580 --> 55:08.200]  this. I'm all in on this.
[55:08.420 --> 55:10.660]  It's the most wholesome thing ever
[55:10.660 --> 55:12.620]  but unfortunately described in the
[55:12.620 --> 55:13.940]  most Andrew way possible.
[55:14.780 --> 55:16.420]  So if we can get the regulation kid
[55:16.420 --> 55:17.960]  auction on the calendar, that'd be great.
[55:18.580 --> 55:20.600]  Listen, that's all Gavin. What I'm
[55:20.600 --> 55:22.620]  advising is supporting
[55:22.620 --> 55:24.780]  spelling culture, which is important.
[55:24.780 --> 55:26.580]  Education. Supporting.
[55:27.060 --> 55:28.820]  We're picking kids and cheering them on.
[55:29.220 --> 55:30.620]  It's not a thing where we're like
[55:31.180 --> 55:32.560]  we want this kid to fail.
[55:32.740 --> 55:34.860]  I might want you to fail, Jeff, but I want
[55:34.860 --> 55:37.000]  all the kids to do great. Just get in line,
[55:37.100 --> 55:37.340]  buddy.
[55:40.040 --> 55:41.040]  It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[55:41.140 --> 55:42.820]  So how do we decide who we pick
[55:42.820 --> 55:43.820]  then if we're not auctioning?
[55:44.920 --> 55:46.900]  Typically how it goes is
[55:46.900 --> 55:48.500]  the final day they'll have like
[55:48.500 --> 55:50.980]  30 kids and then I'll post
[55:50.980 --> 55:52.260]  a list and then we can all just pick.
[55:52.640 --> 55:53.960]  Yeah, but what if I want you to pick?
[55:54.440 --> 55:56.700]  Well, we'll do it in order. We'll find some way to do it.
[55:56.880 --> 55:58.440]  Okay. And when
[55:58.440 --> 55:59.320]  does this happen?
[56:00.640 --> 56:01.780]  It's like May
[56:02.700 --> 56:04.260]  28th. I think it's like 13
[56:04.260 --> 56:05.480]  days away or something.
[56:06.920 --> 56:08.480]  Did you want to record
[56:08.480 --> 56:09.800]  this or stream it or what?
[56:10.360 --> 56:11.420]  I think record
[56:12.040 --> 56:14.300]  would probably be the best. It's probably safer, huh?
[56:14.900 --> 56:15.220]  Yeah.
[56:16.400 --> 56:18.200]  With how Eric is nervous
[56:18.200 --> 56:20.100]  about it, I think record is the way to go.
[56:21.100 --> 56:21.900]  Give it out.
[56:22.100 --> 56:24.120]  Yeah, what kids are we betting
[56:24.120 --> 56:25.260]  on? Like their horses?
[56:25.560 --> 56:27.840]  Like that's the issue.
[56:28.040 --> 56:28.660]  You know what I mean?
[56:29.240 --> 56:31.320]  I mean there probably is betting for it.
[56:31.900 --> 56:34.140]  That doesn't make it okay.
[56:35.020 --> 56:35.520]  Like what
[56:35.980 --> 56:38.160]  is the issue with
[56:38.160 --> 56:38.500]  child rearing?
[56:39.060 --> 56:40.460]  Jeff, am I insane?
[56:41.360 --> 56:44.400]  I feel so uncomfortable in this conversation.
[56:44.580 --> 56:46.120]  I'm just trying to figure out
[56:46.120 --> 56:47.940]  how to cut it out and keep the episode.
[56:47.940 --> 56:48.620]  I
[56:50.860 --> 56:52.280]  recognize these talented
[56:53.140 --> 56:53.940]  athlete spellers
[56:54.680 --> 56:55.740]  performing their craft
[56:55.740 --> 56:58.060]  and I want to honor and respect
[56:58.060 --> 56:59.160]  it at the highest of levels.
[56:59.420 --> 57:01.100]  And maybe win a little money on the side.
[57:01.360 --> 57:04.080]  No money.
[57:04.260 --> 57:05.480]  No money has ever been won.
[57:06.600 --> 57:07.980]  Your draft order. You get to pick
[57:07.980 --> 57:09.540]  your draft order based on how well you do.
[57:09.740 --> 57:11.060]  That's how I do it in our league.
[57:11.360 --> 57:12.800]  But we'll figure out something else.
[57:13.700 --> 57:15.180]  Maybe we have to do a draft.
[57:15.660 --> 57:17.180]  Like a football league or something.
[57:17.920 --> 57:18.400]  That'd be fun.
[57:19.340 --> 57:20.620]  I'm not against that.
[57:21.280 --> 57:23.300]  I'd like to do like a giant elimination
[57:23.300 --> 57:25.340]  pool type thing. I think that would be fun.
[57:25.600 --> 57:26.960]  You want to eliminate a bunch of kids?
[57:27.480 --> 57:29.200]  No, we're talking about football.
[57:29.760 --> 57:30.920]  No. Unrelated.
[57:31.320 --> 57:33.000]  So you want to eliminate a bunch of footballs?
[57:33.600 --> 57:35.320]  Yeah. I want to kill all
[57:35.320 --> 57:36.560]  of them. Deflate them.
[57:37.020 --> 57:37.860]  Get rid of them.
[57:38.860 --> 57:41.340]  No more. And by that I mean
[57:41.340 --> 57:43.260]  Gavin's dumb sport with the kicking.
[57:43.260 --> 57:45.680]  Not the real NFL.
[57:46.140 --> 57:47.340]  It's not my sport.
[57:47.740 --> 57:48.780]  It is your sport.
[57:49.080 --> 57:51.340]  It's the most popular sport on the whole planet.
[57:51.600 --> 57:52.840]  It's the world's sport.
[57:53.860 --> 57:55.400]  Gavin, if you had to pick a sport
[57:55.400 --> 57:56.700]  that was your sport, what would you pick?
[57:58.240 --> 57:58.680]  Cricket.
[57:59.280 --> 58:01.680]  That's what I thought too. I thought you'd be a cricket guy.
[58:01.680 --> 58:02.800]  I kicked your ass at that.
[58:03.160 --> 58:05.480]  It's my sport. Get the fuck out of here.
[58:08.060 --> 58:09.680]  We should play a rugby game.
[58:09.920 --> 58:11.020]  That's also my sport.
[58:12.160 --> 58:13.100]  I used to have to play that
[58:13.100 --> 58:14.400]  at school. How bullshit is that?
[58:16.340 --> 58:16.660]  Rugby?
[58:17.080 --> 58:18.480]  Yeah, I had to wake up
[58:18.880 --> 58:20.820]  like 7 o'clock, go out in the rain,
[58:21.540 --> 58:23.000]  put on my football boots and just get
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.020]  caked in mud and then I'd just go in the rest
[58:25.020 --> 58:27.120]  of the day, do English and math
[58:27.120 --> 58:28.860]  covered in mud all day. It was bullshit.
[58:29.940 --> 58:31.140]  I had to play football
[58:31.140 --> 58:32.420]  and gym and do the same shit.
[58:33.040 --> 58:35.180]  I feel like America has showers at the schools.
[58:35.680 --> 58:37.040]  Oh yeah, you didn't get to take
[58:37.040 --> 58:39.040]  showers? We had them, but they'd all
[58:39.040 --> 58:40.640]  been, they were always taped off.
[58:41.020 --> 58:41.720]  I don't think they wanted
[58:42.800 --> 58:43.800]  kids showering.
[58:44.160 --> 58:46.340]  You wanted dirty little kids running around?
[58:46.440 --> 58:46.900]  Yeah.
[58:48.120 --> 58:50.520]  And then Andrew would bet on them? What happened?
[58:50.760 --> 58:52.660]  I don't bet on them.
[58:53.240 --> 58:55.020]  I pick which one I think
[58:55.020 --> 58:56.760]  will win and then we do
[58:56.760 --> 58:57.960]  an order around it.
[59:00.500 --> 59:03.040]  I read about what their interests are
[59:03.040 --> 59:05.180]  and what their past Fellingby records are
[59:05.180 --> 59:06.600]  and then I make a determination.
[59:08.060 --> 59:08.740]  Sometimes I'll
[59:08.740 --> 59:10.740]  watch the whole B because you can see
[59:10.740 --> 59:12.220]  all of it up to the final and
[59:12.740 --> 59:14.320]  evaluate how they do under pressure
[59:14.320 --> 59:16.600]  and are they asking the
[59:16.600 --> 59:18.600]  questions or not? I mean, there's a whole thing.
[59:18.820 --> 59:19.960]  How many times have you done this?
[59:21.600 --> 59:22.900]  Four years, probably.
[59:23.320 --> 59:24.100]  Have you ever won?
[59:24.140 --> 59:26.760]  I don't think I have, no.
[59:26.920 --> 59:27.820]  It got real close.
[59:28.060 --> 59:29.780]  What's the highest your kid has ever placed?
[59:31.400 --> 59:32.680]  I sort of technically
[59:32.680 --> 59:34.900]  won one year because there was a seven way tie
[59:34.900 --> 59:37.040]  two years ago and I was
[59:37.040 --> 59:38.120]  one of the seven.
[59:38.740 --> 59:41.000]  That's like being times person of the
[59:41.000 --> 59:41.940]  year that one year.
[59:42.080 --> 59:43.960]  I know, but they
[59:44.600 --> 59:46.100]  ran out of stuff.
[59:46.340 --> 59:48.960]  They had to change the Fellingby rules last
[59:48.960 --> 59:50.960]  year to avoid that situation ever
[59:50.960 --> 59:51.620]  happening again.
[59:52.400 --> 59:54.440]  But I don't think I've ever won by myself.
[59:54.600 --> 59:56.620]  I think last year I was second
[59:56.620 --> 59:58.980]  maybe or third. It's intense.
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.660]  It goes for like an hour
[01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.680]  and
[01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:03.580]  it's stressful.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.260]  But it's a lot of fun.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.760]  Do you think if you closed your eyes, maybe you do this,
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.640]  you could spell a single one of the fucking
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.920]  words? No, not at all.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.720]  We should
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.760]  do that. We should play along with instead
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.820]  of betting on the kids and see how well we do.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.780]  First of all, not betting. Second of all,
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.540]  what's interesting
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.720]  is in the preliminary rounds
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.440]  they do word definitions
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.600]  so like all of the spelling
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:29.840]  impossible, the word
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.600]  definition seems so much easier.
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.800]  I get a lot of those
[01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.700]  typically. It's a multiple choice.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.740]  It'll be like
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.660]  word definition, revolution.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.620]  What does revolution mean?
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.420]  Is it A, B, or C?
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.800]  And the kids will always get it wrong.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.040]  What's A, B, and C?
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.220]  What are my options?
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.000]  Option A is
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.300]  it is
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.360]  a
[01:00:56.660 --> 01:00:57.680]  rechargeable battery
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.200]  pack that
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.600]  Gavin owns.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.400]  Option B
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.940]  is
[01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.160]  it is a
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.480]  dancing video
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.540]  that would actually be
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.280]  something that slowly
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.700]  spins in a circle.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.540]  It is something that slowly spins.
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.040]  It's also revolution.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.600]  It is a Howard
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.520]  Hughes airplane is
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.460]  option B
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.000]  and
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.960]  option C
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.580]  would be
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.820]  option C
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:34.180]  would be like
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.280]  how do you describe it? It's like when
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.700]  you overthrow something.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.540]  Right? Like when the people
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.780]  are like enough is enough.
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.240]  The kids get that shit wrong with those
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.540]  that's terrible.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.640]  Listen, I didn't write that
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.460]  okay? I just am going off of what
[01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.240]  They should spend less time spelling and more time
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.660]  comprehending. God damn.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.220]  Joke's on you, I put the APC revolution under my desk.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.020]  I was self-conscious
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.140]  earlier when Jeff was dropping out and we had
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.100]  to carry a little bit with like matrix talk
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.080]  and like these different things or whatever, but I will
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.080]  say like the last eight minutes of this podcast have
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.780]  really been something else.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.040]  So I don't feel so bad about what was happening
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.100]  in the middle now. And if you thought those eight
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.080]  minutes were fun, wait until we
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.100]  do it for 90 minutes. You're gonna have a
[01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:18.940]  fucking blast.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.400]  I'm gonna go to the
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.160]  grocery store right after we do this and look
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:27.620]  for weird sodas and gravy in a can.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:29.000]  I love it. That's great.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:31.460]  Let's wrap this one up and call it
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.340]  and then, you know, we'll go from there.
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.220]  How about that? Oh, I wasn't trying to
[01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.960]  in the podcast. I'd go for another hour or so if you want.
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.080]  Yeah, no, we're not. We're not gonna do we've already been going for about
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.480]  four. So I think we're good.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:42.860]  Can I ask you a question before we end?
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.340]  Absolutely. What is your least
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.140]  favorite part of our new
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:47.580]  business?
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.400]  Wow.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.100]  It is probably
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.520]  the government paperwork
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.040]  and making sure that everything's filed properly.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.600]  Like, everything
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.980]  about it is great, except for
[01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:01.700]  hey, don't forget this one.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.640]  Oh, hey, did you do this one? Hey, this is
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.500]  filled out wrong. Hey, did you link this thing?
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.680]  Oh, actually, the titling on this one
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.520]  is wrong. It has to be redone. Can anyone
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.560]  call the IRS? It's
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:11.940]  probably that.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.460]  Now, I will say,
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:16.960]  if you ask me again in
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.480]  a year, it will
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.320]  be the thing where you guys go,
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.840]  yeah, we should do this. And then
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.900]  I have to keep going, who is we?
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.460]  We is you, though.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.460]  Here's the thing. No, it's
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.640]  not. We is not me.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.240]  That's how it works.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.800]  That's how it worked previously.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.200]  No, hang on, hang on.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.320]  That's how it worked previously when we had people
[01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.340]  that I could defer to and get help
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.420]  from. I am not shouldering this burden
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.280]  when you guys have an idea. I will
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.560]  help put it together. I will not
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.540]  shoulder the burden of harebrained schemes.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.760]  Why not?
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.420]  I feel like
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:59.260]  I feel like I'm well within my right to say
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.500]  no, I will not be doing the harebrained
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:03.280]  schemes. I will help
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.300]  and facilitate. So in a year
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.620]  that will be the issue.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.020]  I vote Eric does producing role.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.540]  Just for the harebrained schemes.
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.620]  Yeah, harebrained schemes.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.400]  Vote all you want.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.500]  I might not make it to this time
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.500]  next year in this company.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.780]  We got a fucking revolution on our hands.
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.280]  I'm simply letting you know where I stand.
[01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:26.020]  No harebrained
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:26.400]  schemes.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.480]  I'm fine with harebrained schemes
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:31.480]  but when I say who
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:33.240]  is us and you say us is you,
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.220]  no it's not.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.500]  If us isn't you, it's
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.420]  surely on you to make
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:41.380]  an us of other people.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.840]  Who are we?
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.040]  See?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.440]  This is why I won't make it to this time next
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.520]  year. Eric, as your temporary
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.380]  boss, I'm going to have to insist that you
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:53.360]  stay out of your contract for at least
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:53.880]  another year.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.380]  I'm telling you right now because if this is
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.360]  the way that it goes, it ain't going this way.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.460]  It's going to be bad. Alright, let's take a vote
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:03.340]  on it. Vote on it all you want.
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:04.840]  Is it going to go good or bad?
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:06.400]  I vote
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:07.580]  I vote good.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:09.060]  I vote bad.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.080]  Eric votes bad, he wants it to go bad.
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.500]  I'm sorry, Nick voted good.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.300]  I'm letting you know what's going to happen.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.120]  We just voted on good.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.420]  Andrew? He didn't vote.
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.080]  Good or bad?
[01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.360]  Andrew's like, I'm spelling the kids.
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.160]  Never mind. Good or bad?
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.560]  Is it going to go good or bad?
[01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.460]  4-1.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.680]  The only one who seems to want this to go bad is you, Eric.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:33.500]  I certainly don't want it to go bad.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.540]  Oh, they were set.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.360]  Great.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.020]  Where do you fall on the whole
[01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.720]  weird shit in a can bit?
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.060]  We can put that together,
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.740]  but it's not just me.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.600]  That's what I'm telling you
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:49.080]  in this whole thing. When it's us,
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.640]  and it's your idea,
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.760]  I'm not going to pick up that ball
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.940]  and run with it 100%
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.620]  of the time. I will absolutely
[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.640]  help to facilitate and do this stuff,
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.500]  but I'm not going to listen to every
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.280]  half-baked idea in the show
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.940]  and do it automatically.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.400]  So you're saying you'll have
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.040]  a hand on a shared ball.
[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.200]  Yeah, absolutely. Yes.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.580]  Because when it is
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.500]  we should do this, I'm saying
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.340]  who is we? We has to be
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.580]  the person who had the idea, or someone else
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.560]  stepping up, and me, and I
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.440]  can help guide this thing and make this all happen.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.660]  But I cannot do it all.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.640]  That sounds like a we.
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.540]  Right. Which is what
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.600]  makes sense when I say who is we
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.500]  and Gavin says we is you
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.800]  and I say no, it's not!
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.580]  What don't you get?
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.520]  When I say we is you, I mean
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:41.460]  the ball has to start rolling with
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:42.180]  someone.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:45.560]  We is you means
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.400]  we is me, and I'm saying
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.680]  no, it's not. But we can't
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.860]  have we without me.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:53.500]  Right, but Gavin
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.180]  didn't say we is us.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:56.940]  Gavin said we is you.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.040]  That is what I'm being
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:00.920]  very deliberate and
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.180]  very clear here. We is not just me.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:04.940]  But get the ball
[01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:06.720]  rolling and we'll all put hands on the ball.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.680]  That's what I don't trust.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.000]  I need to see it and we can do it.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.060]  Does the ball have
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:13.640]  an orifice?
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.580]  I'd say it's got at least two.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:18.420]  I will
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.460]  put my hand all over that ball.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.040]  So
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.480]  Andrew, did you pick a kid yet or what?
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.580]  A what?
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.620]  I feel like so far the ball
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.380]  in general has been very well shared.
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.280]  We've all been doing all kinds of shit.
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.240]  It's all been
[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.360]  getting everything together
[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.380]  to do this business and I feel really really
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.500]  good about it. We are getting to the
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.220]  point now where we are creating
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.260]  shows and content and doing this stuff
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.080]  and the
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.180]  wacky idea factory begins
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.020]  and
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.260]  it's fun. I love
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.120]  the wacky idea. I have no problem with the
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.200]  wacky idea factory. I love it. It's a lot of fun.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.240]  But I want to make sure the wacky idea
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.060]  factory isn't just Eric by himself
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.340]  trying to get the wacky idea, the half-baked
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.280]  I'm telling you, I'm not
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:08.680]  saying
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.300]  that you guys have let anything drop.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.280]  I'm simply saying when we
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.440]  who is that and you say it's you
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.200]  it's not just me.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:19.820]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:21.920]  Allow me to be clear.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.860]  When we have
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.380]  the ball,
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.360]  100% of the time
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.480]  no matter whose ball it is,
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.220]  no matter who creates the ball,
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.760]  my fist is in it.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.920]  There's always going to be
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.920]  at least a me with the ball. So anybody else
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:39.760]  that touches the ball or inserts
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.820]  anything into the ball, it becomes a we.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.960]  But there's always going to be a me involved
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.840]  in this ball, guys. I'm fisting it hard
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.840]  all day long. So don't ever feel like it's
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.740]  just going to be you because it can't only
[01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:51.200]  be you because I'm already in there.
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:53.780]  Yeah, I'm going to touch every ball.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:55.860]  That's great.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.300]  I'm super into that.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.740]  I'm not good at starting the movement of the ball. I can
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.760]  provide the ball.
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:01.780]  Right.
[01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.740]  But it can't be a full handoff. That's what
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:07.380]  I'm saying. It can't be
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:09.760]  well, I had the idea, now Eric, you take
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.420]  care of it. It can't work that way.
[01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:13.560]  It's not like, hey, you make this content.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.020]  I'm not saying
[01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.620]  I'm not saying that.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.740]  I'm saying when I asked, who's we?
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.240]  You said, we is you.
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.300]  That is what this whole conversation
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.060]  is. Please understand
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.160]  that I agree with everything you guys are
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.960]  saying right now. I'm saying
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.220]  that when I asked, you said, we is
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.160]  you. And I said, no, it's not.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.160]  That's all.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.220]  Well, I think technically you're a part of we.
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.140]  So it's you plus.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:41.220]  That is not what was said.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:42.560]  Because don't forget,
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.900]  don't forget I'm in the ball right now.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:45.720]  Knuckles wet.
[01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:48.380]  I get it. And I think this was a good
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:50.420]  conversation to have. And I'm glad that we
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:50.840]  had it.
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.440]  I feel like we should resolve
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.960]  all these conflicts in episode.
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.500]  I'm totally into that. I have no
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.220]  problem with that. Was this a conflict?
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.520]  No, no, not at all. But it's as close
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.580]  to a conflict as we typically get.
[01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.480]  I just like the visual of
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:08.480]  we're all in the hair brain factory looking at
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:10.120]  the window and there's a whole
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.760]  Patreon waiting outside.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.180]  And I'm excited about it.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.260]  We gotta deliver.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.260]  We do gotta deliver.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.120]  Now, before we had this conversation, in my head
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.480]  the hair brain factory was
[01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.140]  four people looking down
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.140]  at one factory worker, me,
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.260]  to a whole bunch of people on the outside.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.260]  Yeah, you saw it as you're down
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.160]  on the floor and we're all up on like a gantry
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:32.880]  with clipboards.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.840]  Eric, you've also got a clipboard.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.760]  You also have a clipboard. Oh, cool, great.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.780]  We've got a lab coat
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:42.080]  just like us. Eric's just like slamming
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.740]  his clipboard into the ground.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.020]  Kicking it across the floor.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.180]  This factory sucks!
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.460]  Oh, man. It's the very
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.520]  fucking best, isn't it? Like how you said
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:57.840]  now we have to deliver? I'm so excited to deliver.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.940]  I'm very excited.
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:01.460]  It's the fun part. It is the
[01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.920]  best kind of positive
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.140]  pressure I can ever...
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.500]  It's almost like...
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.960]  It's a... I don't want to turn it into
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.320]  pee talk, but it's really great. I really love
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.880]  it. I love just
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.680]  knowing that I have to deliver.
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.180]  I feel like we've got balls coming out of our anus right now.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.020]  Yeah, we do. I've got so many balls,
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:21.160]  I don't know where to put them all. They're in my mouth.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.100]  I'm just like juggling balls in my mouth
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.120]  because where else am I going to put them? It's true.
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.840]  All right, why don't you go and do the outro?
[01:11:27.940 --> 01:11:29.940]  Let's get out of here. Hey, thanks for listening
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.900]  to another episode of the Regulation
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.220]  Podcast. If you wanted to,
[01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:35.980]  I don't know, tell a friend or
[01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.500]  a co-worker or a family member
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.040]  about a really fun, family-friendly,
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.620]  safe-to-say podcast,
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.380]  you could use this one, for instance. Regulation
[01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.000]  Podcast. I think that they might be
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.100]  highly entertained. Everybody
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.260]  has at one point in their life
[01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:52.160]  thought to themselves, how much money would
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:54.260]  I pay to shoot a horse between the eyes?
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.040]  And
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.240]  those are the kind of themes that we explore
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.860]  in a fun, family-friendly way.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.260]  But you know that because you've already listened to it. I'm just trying to give
